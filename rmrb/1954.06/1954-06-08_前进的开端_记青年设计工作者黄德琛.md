    A Beginning of Progress
    ——On Young Design Worker Huang Dechen
  　Shi Hong　Li Ping
    In September 1952, the central government uniformly assigned a group of students who had just graduated from higher education institutions to the industrial construction front. Young technician Huang Dechen was one of them. When he learned that he was assigned to Anshan Iron and Steel to participate in the construction of China's first iron and steel base, he felt infinite excitement and joy, just like all his classmates. Design work is very complex and meticulous. After Huang Dechen was assigned to the Industrial Furnace Design Section of the Design Company, the first difficulty he encountered was drafting. He studied metallurgy in school, knew neither how to read drawings nor had done any design work. However, the design tasks were very urgent. If he couldn't produce designs because he couldn't understand the drawings, it would inevitably affect the completion of the entire design progress, causing the construction department to "stop work waiting for drawings." Huang Dechen often thought about this problem, but couldn't find a satisfactory solution.
    Just then, the Design Company launched an ideological construction movement. Through summarizing the design ideology in connection with engineering, he received extremely profound education in the design summary of the weighing trolley for the No. 8 blast furnace. He began to understand that the key to good design is: to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, especially how to apply the advanced Soviet technology to the design in combination with the actual situation. At this time, he felt relieved. He kept in mind: I must follow the path of learning from the Soviet Union and learn design skills well from the Soviet experts.
    When the task was assigned, his first task was to participate in the technical design of the cupola furnace. At that time, let alone drawing, he didn't even know what a cupola furnace looked like.
    The design task was urgent, and he pondered how to take effective measures to complete the first design task. He remembered the lesson of not paying attention to collecting original data in the "weighing trolley" design, so he decided to go to the factory first to understand the physical objects and collect relevant data. Coincidentally, the cupola furnace at the factory was producing at night, so he carefully looked at the furnace structure and layout during the day, and then went to the factory at night to see the actual operation of the workers. When the workers and technicians at the factory saw that he was studying so hard, running seven or eight miles in their spare time, everyone was happy to help him and willing to be good friends with him.
    Soon, Huang Dechen learned a lot of production operation knowledge from the workers and technicians, making up for his own shortcomings. In addition, he worked hard to learn the Soviet standard design materials. In this way, he completed the cupola furnace design according to the schedule. After all, it was the first time, and the product he designed was not satisfactory. When the professional group leader Peng Dejing reviewed the design, he found that the bricklaying method of the furnace cover of the cupola furnace was vague and lacked explanation. He also helped him to learn from the Soviet design experience, revise the drawings, and supplement the design.
    Through the practice of cupola furnace design, Huang Dechen felt that the things he learned in school could not keep up with the needs of the work, and he needed to strengthen his study and improve his design ability. In addition to working hard during the day, he studied the lecture notes of Soviet experts and professional books on industrial furnace construction in the evening and morning. He couldn't wait to swallow everything into his stomach. Once, the Soviet expert Comrade Karodayev said in his lecture: "The best way for technicians to improve themselves is to carry out systematic study in combination with practical work." This inspired him greatly, and he was determined to further study the courses taught by Soviet experts. After more than a year of hard study, he basically mastered the professional knowledge of furnace construction. He gradually mastered the principle of learning what he designs, and appropriately applying what he learned to his design work. If he didn't understand something, he would ask others. If he wasn't sure, he would analyze and study it, and ask the experts with his own opinions in a prepared and purposeful manner. In the design of the continuous heating furnace door of the medium-sized factory, asbestos boards were also installed. This design method saved money and improved the operating conditions of the workers, and the Soviet experts agreed with this opinion.
    The reconstruction design of the heating furnace in the medium-sized factory required surveying and mapping the dimensions of the vertical flue at the end of the furnace. When going to survey and map, it happened that the furnace had been shut down for several hours after the repair, and the temperature at the end of the furnace gradually increased. However, without going into the furnace to survey and map, relying solely on the old data would make it difficult to determine the flue design, and even affect the transformation of the entire furnace. The group studied how to get people into the furnace to survey and map. Someone suggested pouring cold water into the furnace to lower the furnace temperature before surveying and mapping. However, if this was done, the furnace bricks would crack due to sudden cooling. After discussion, it was decided to enter the furnace to survey and map by soaking the clothes with cold water. The people who ran into the furnace in the high temperature were like people who had just been fished out of the water, and their clothes were soaked. After entering the furnace, hot air immediately rose from their bodies, and sweat dripped down. The rubber shoes made a clicking sound when they moved on the ground due to the heat, and the steel ruler was also hot to the touch. Halfway through the survey, Huang Dechen felt his vision blurred and he couldn't see the scale of the steel ruler. His nearsightedness was already bad on weekdays, but now the frame of his nearsighted glasses slipped off the bridge of his nose due to the softening of the frame by the high temperature, making it even more difficult to see. Huang Dechen immediately took off his glasses, and used the steel ruler skillfully with the knowledge he had learned about collecting data, and finally completed the survey task. Four comrades participated in this work together, and Zhao Zhenli, who was present, was greatly moved. He recalled that when he collected data for a large factory in the past, he used visual estimation instead of actual measurement, estimating a sixty-meter-high chimney as forty meters, and felt very ashamed. When he returned to the department, he wrote an article entitled "Learning from Comrade Huang Dechen's Spirit of Seeking Truth from Facts" and posted it on the blackboard newspaper.
    Comrade Huang Dechen's exemplary deeds in collecting data on heating furnaces in medium-sized factories quickly spread throughout the entire department. Because the data was collected comprehensively and correctly, it played a significant role in completing the design of the heating furnace flue.
    In June 1953, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. After joining the Party, Huang Dechen became more active in his work, thinking of various ways to do his work well, and also trying to save construction funds for the country. Last August, Huang Dechen received the task of preparing the budget for the drying furnace project of the Mechanical General Factory. This was a new job. He thought that Soviet experts had suggested: "Design budget is to better control national investment, and it should be done by the designer himself. The designer knows the unit price of the materials, and carefully analyzes and compares to try to use national funds reasonably." In order to prepare the budget well, Huang Dechen went to the budget section to learn how to prepare the budget. He first checked the investment of the entire furnace and found that the metal structure of the furnace accounted for more than 60% of the total investment. After a detailed investigation, he learned that the size of the selected steel was too large. At that time, the design team leader Jin Zhigan found that the furnace foundation needed to be modified. He and the participants in the design jointly studied and decided to shorten the metal structure columns and raise the outer frame of the foundation. After the modification, the investment was saved by about 10 million yuan.
    When designing the layout plan for the fishplate heating furnace, he and the co-designers collected detailed old foundation data and considered using the original foundation. They proposed a total of three comparative schemes. At the same time, he also considered that it was possible to install a preheater in the factory building, but increasing the preheater required investment. They calculated and compared the investment in adding a preheater with the value of fuel that could be saved, and the conclusion was that: less than half a year after production, all the investment of 600 million yuan in the preheater could be recovered. This not only reduced production costs, but also solved the problem of reducing the waste gas temperature in the chimney technically. Therefore, the original plan to install a water sprayer solely to reduce the chimney temperature without reducing fuel consumption was rejected. They also considered the service life and development direction of the heating furnace in the design. This realistic method of carrying out multi-scheme design was praised by the Soviet expert Comrade Karodayev.
    After the start of the general line study, the Furnace Construction Section summarized the work of designing heating furnaces in medium-sized factories. Huang Dechen started from checking the budget and found that the investment in the complete set of automatic instruments for the two furnaces reached 1.1 billion yuan. After analyzing this design, he believed that under the current production situation and national economic conditions, it was wasteful and unreasonable to install automatic instruments for the modified furnace, and that indicating instruments could meet the requirements. This would save an investment of 900 million yuan. After joint research with the participants in the design, he also found that the entire design of the heating furnace in the medium-sized factory lacked an economic accounting perspective. If the old bricks and the hanging brick furnace roof were not replaced, the investment could be saved by more than 300 million yuan. These opinions were immediately adopted.
    When the three major projects were completed last year, Huang Dechen was rated as a first-class advanced producer in Anshan Iron and Steel's basic construction. But he is not satisfied with his existing achievements. In his view, this is just the beginning of his journey on the bright path of building socialism.

    前进的开端
    ——记青年设计工作者黄德琛
  　石虹　力平
    一九五二年九月，中央统一分配了一批刚从高等学校毕业的学生到工业建设战线上去，青年技术员黄德琛就是其中的一个。当他知道自己被分配到鞍钢参加建设中国第一个钢铁基地的时候，他和所有的同学一样感到无限的兴奋和愉快。设计工作是非常复杂和细致的工作，黄德琛被分配到设计公司工业炉设计科后，遇到的第一个困难，就是制图。他在学校中学的是冶金，既不会看图，也没有作过设计，然而，设计任务是非常紧急的，如果因看不懂图而做不出设计来，就必然影响整个设计进度的完成，造成施工部门“停工待图”的现象。黄德琛碰到这个问题，经常考虑，老找不出一个合意的办法来。
    正巧，设计公司开展思想建设运动，通过总结工程联系设计思想，在第八炼铁炉秤量车设计总结中，他受到极为深刻的教育。他开始领会到做好设计的关键是：学习苏联先进经验，特别是如何把苏联的先进技术结合实际情况运用到设计中来。这时候，他心情开朗起来，他牢记着：我必须遵循着学习苏联的途径，好好地跟苏联专家学习设计本领。
    任务分配下来了，他的第一个任务是参加化铁炉的技术设计。那时候他别说画图，就连化铁炉是什么样子的东西，还不知道呢。
    设计任务是紧急的，他盘算着如何采取有效的办法来完成第一个设计任务。他记起了“秤量车”设计中不重视搜集原始资料的教训，就打定主意，先下厂了解实物，搜集有关资料，恰巧，现厂的化铁炉是在晚上生产，他就在白天仔细地看了炉子结构和布置，晚上再下厂看工人实际操作。现厂的工人和技术员见他这样用心学习，在业余时间跑了七、八里路，大家都乐意帮助他，愿意和他做好朋友。
    不久，黄德琛向工人和技术员学到了许多生产操作知识，弥补了他自己不足的地方。另外他努力学习苏联的标准设计资料，就这样，他按进度完成了化铁炉设计。毕竟还是第一次，他设计的产品，不能令人满意。专业组长彭德镜在审核设计时，发现化铁炉设计前炉的炉盖部分砌砖方法含混不清，缺乏说明。并帮助他一起学习苏联设计经验，进行改图，补充设计。
    黄德琛经过化铁炉设计的实践，感到学校中所学的东西赶不上工作的需要，需要加强学习，提高设计能力。他除了白天好好工作外，在晚上和早上学习苏联专家讲课笔记和工业筑炉上的专业书籍，他恨不得将一切的东西都吞进肚子里。一次苏联专家卡罗大叶夫同志在讲课时说：“技术人员提高自己的最好方法是能结合实际工作进行有系统的学习。”这对他启发很大，他决心进一步学习好苏联专家讲授的课程。经过一年多刻苦学习，他基本上掌握了筑炉的专业知识。他逐渐掌握到设计什么就学什么，把学到的东西适当地运用到设计工作中去。自己不懂的就去请问别人，没有把握的地方加以分析研究，带着自己的意见有准备有目的地去问专家。在设计中型厂连续加热炉门上也安了石棉板，这种设计方法既省钱又改善了工友操作条件，苏联专家同意了这个意见。
    中型厂加热炉改建设计，需要测绘炉尾竖烟道尺寸。去测绘的时候，正巧炉子修理后停火已经有几小时了，炉尾温度逐步升高，但是，不进到炉里去测绘，单凭旧有资料，就会使烟道设计难以确定，甚至会影响整个炉子的改造。小组研究人怎样进到炉里去测绘的方法，有人提出向炉内浇冷水，使炉温降低再进行测绘。可是，如果这样做，炉砖将因骤冷而破裂。经过讨论后就决定用冷水浇湿了衣服办法进炉测绘。在高温中跑到炉子里去测绘的人们，像刚从水里捞出来的人一样，衣服都湿透了。进到炉里以后，立刻浑身冒着热气，汗珠滚滚下来，呼吸也困难了，胶鞋遇热走动时粘着地答答发响，钢尺也烫手了，测绘到中途，黄德琛感到视线模糊，看不清钢尺的刻度。他的近视眼平日视力就不好，那知现在近视眼镜胶框因受高温软化从鼻梁上溜下来了，就更看不清了。黄德琛立刻取下了眼镜，以他学到的收集资料的知识，熟练地使用着钢尺，终于完成了测绘任务。一同参加这次工作的有四位同志，其中在场的赵振理受了很大的感动，他联想起过去自己收集大型厂资料时，以目测代替实测，把六十公尺高的烟囱估为四十公尺那件事，感到非常惭愧。回到科里他写了一篇以学习黄德琛同志实事求是的精神为题的稿件登在黑板报上。
    黄德琛同志收集中型厂加热炉资料时的模范事迹，很快就传遍了全科。由于资料收集得全面正确，对完成加热炉烟道设计起了很大作用。
    一九五三年六月，他光荣地参加了中国共产党。黄德琛入党以后，工作更积极了，想各种办法，把工作搞好，并且还设法为国家节省建设资金。去年八月，黄德琛接到编制机械总厂干燥炉工程预算的任务。这是个新的工作，他想，苏联专家曾经建议过：“设计预算是为了更好地掌握国家投资，应该由设计者本人来作，设计人员知道了材料的单价，精打细算分析比较，才能尽量作到合理地使用国家资金”。为了编制好预算，黄德琛就到预算科去学习预算的编法。他首先从整个炉子的投资中检查，发现炉子的金属结构占全部投资的百分之六十以上，细查后知道是型钢选用的尺寸太大，当时正好设计小组长金之干发现炉子基础需要修改，他就和参加设计的人共同研究，决定把金属结构柱子减短而把基础外框提高，经过修改，节省投资约一千万元。
    设计鱼尾板加热炉布置方案时，他和共同设计的人详细搜集旧有基础资料，考虑利用原有基础，共提出了三个比较方案，同时他还考虑到在厂房面积上有可能安装预热器，但增加预热器需要投资，他们把增设预热器的投资与可节省燃料的价值进行计算和比较，得出的结论是：生产后不到半年，就可捞回全部预热器投资六亿元。这不但降低了生产成本，而且在技术上可以解决降低烟囱内废气温度的问题，于是否决了原有的不能降低燃料消耗量单为降低烟囱温度安装喷水器的方案。他们还在设计中考虑加热炉的使用年限和发展方向。这种实事求是进行多方案设计的方法，得到了苏联专家卡罗大叶夫同志的赞扬。
    开始总路线学习以后，筑炉科总结设计中型厂加热炉的工作，黄德琛从检查预算出发，发现二个炉子的全套自动化计器的投资共达十一亿元。他分析了这个设计后，认为在目前的生产情况和国家经济条件下，改造炉子安设自动化计器是浪费和不合理的，改用指示仪表即可满足要求。这样就可节省投资九亿元。经过他和参加设计的人共同研究后，又发现中型厂加热炉整个设计缺乏经济核算观点，如果不更换旧砖及吊砖炉顶，还能节省投资三亿元以上。这些意见立刻被采纳了。
    去年三大工程竣工时，黄德琛被评为鞍钢基本建设一等先进生产者。但他并不满足于现有的成就。在他看来，这只是他在建设社会主义光明途径上的开端。
