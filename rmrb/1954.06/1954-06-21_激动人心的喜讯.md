Exciting Good News
Yu Fei

This is a corner outside Beijing city.

The morning of the 15th was as peaceful as usual. The soldiers guarding the capital were diligently training on the drill ground.

After the mess call sounded, Zhang Shuilin, the political instructor of the machine gun company, hurried towards the dining hall. Suddenly, a loud and clear voice came from the loudspeaker:

	“Article 19: The People's Republic of China safeguards the people's democratic system, protects the citizens' safety and rights, and suppresses all treasonous and counter-revolutionary activities…”

	"The Constitution! The draft Constitution has been published!" He was so excited that he almost shouted, and couldn't help but stop to listen carefully.

	"The draft Constitution has been published! The draft Constitution has been published!"

The soldiers told each other the news, their faces revealing irrepressible joy.

After a while, the newspapers arrived. A burst of pleasant commotion immediately arose in the corridor of the building. People poured into the duty room of the company headquarters, vying to see the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" printed in large font, and the huge photograph on the front page of the Central People's Government Committee passing the draft Constitution. As they looked, some people began to read it aloud.

At nap time, people gradually quieted down. Instructor Zhang took a newspaper back to his dormitory and began to read it carefully, line by line.

	"After more than a hundred years of heroic struggle, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, finally achieved the great victory of the people's revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in 1949..." The opening of the draft Constitution strongly attracted him, like a surge of heat flowing through his whole body. He deeply realized from his own experience how hard-won today's victory of the Chinese revolution was! He thought of the arduous struggles carried out in northern Shaanxi during the Third Revolutionary Civil War.

That was in the autumn of 1947. He and his comrades, with the great aspiration of "Defending the Party Central Committee, defending Chairman Mao," crossed the Yellow River and stepped into the mountains and ridges of northern Shaanxi. He immediately began to doubt:

	"How can Chairman Mao be here?"

But Chairman Mao lived here, directing the People's Liberation War. This was a day he would never forget. He met Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao even spoke to them.

The place where Chairman Mao spoke was an open space on the top of a mountain that the locals used for threshing grain. Chairman Mao was wearing an old gray cotton coat, and his face was somewhat tanned, but his spirit was very full.

Chairman Mao told them why the Party Central Committee had to persist in fighting in northern Shaanxi, and also told them that only by carrying out arduous struggles could the revolution be victorious. In the future, the revolution would not only achieve victory in northern Shaanxi, but also in all of China.

That time, the education he received was so profound and the encouragement was so great! He was not only more confident in victory, but also understood that he must use a tenacious and indomitable spirit to strive for victory. From that time on, he had always been responsible for the glorious task of defending the Party Central Committee and defending Chairman Mao. From that time on, they followed the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao over countless high mountains and ridges, and walked countless rugged paths. Every night, he saw the twinkling lights in the houses of ordinary peasants, until late at night, sometimes until dawn. That was Chairman Mao and other responsible comrades of the Central Committee studying the revolution and the great affairs of the country. Now, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are leading the people of the whole country forward along the socialist road. So many years of arduous struggle, so many years of sweat and blood, so many years of valuable experience in struggle, are all condensed in this draft Constitution…

As Instructor Zhang read, he thought, every word and every sentence in the draft Constitution was fused with his thoughts and his past memories.

After dinner, Instructor Zhang convened a meeting of the Party branch committee to study how to learn and publicize the draft Constitution. He said: "With the Constitution, our future path will be clearer!"

The next day when I went to visit him, he was concentrating on reading the draft Constitution and the People's Daily editorial. He carefully marked the important places with a red pencil. In front of him was a map, and there was also a winding red line drawn on the map with a red pencil. The starting point of this red line was Yan'an, and its ending point was our capital—Beijing.

	"Our revolution has gone through so many arduous struggles!" he said excitedly, pointing to the red line on the map. Obviously, he was thinking of the road he had traveled in the past. At this moment, cheerful shouts, singing, and accordion music came from outside the window. Looking out of the window, there were many newly built towering buildings and many towering construction scaffolding. A train roared by, speeding past not far away.

	"The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have led us to achieve such great victories," he said after a moment of silence. "We have established the People's Republic of China, and now we are formulating a constitution, leading us to gradually build socialism. Our task is to defend these victories, to defend the capital, and to defend Chairman Mao!"

The sky gradually darkened, and the drill ground was filled with joy. The soldiers guarding the capital were celebrating the promulgation of the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China!

    激动人心的喜讯
    余非
    这是北京城外的一角。
    十五日这天早晨也像往常一样的宁静，警卫首都的战士们正在操场上热心地操练着。
    开饭号音响过后，机枪连指导员张水林急匆匆地向饭厅走去。忽然，从播音器里传来一阵响亮、清晰的声音：
      “第十九条，中华人民共和国保卫人民民主制度，保护公民的安全和权利，镇压一切叛国的和反革命的活动，……”
      “宪法！这是宪法草案公布了！”他兴奋得几乎叫出声来，不禁停下脚步细听着。
      “宪法草案公布了！宪法草案公布了！”
    战士们互相传告着，脸上流露着压抑不住的喜悦。
    一会，报纸来了，在楼房的走廊里立刻引起一阵愉快的骚动，人们涌进连部的值班室，争着看那用大号的字体排印的“中华人民共和国宪法草案”，和登在第一版上的中央人民政府委员会通过宪法草案时的巨大照片，看着看着有人就大声朗诵起来。
    睡午觉的时候，人们才渐渐静下来，张指导员拿着一份报纸回到宿舍里，开始一条一条地细读起来。
      “中国人民经过一百多年的英勇奋斗，终于在中国共产党领导下，在一九四九年取得了反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的人民革命的伟大胜利，……”宪法草案一开头就强烈地吸引着他，像一股热流通过他的全身。他以自己的经历深深体会到中国革命得到今天的胜利是多么不容易啊！他想起了第三次国内革命战争时期在陕北进行的那些艰苦斗争。
    那时是一九四七年的秋天，他和自己的战友怀着“保卫党中央，保卫毛主席”的伟大愿望，渡过黄河，踏进陕北的丛山峻岭里，立刻他就怀疑起来了：
      “毛主席怎么能在这里呀？”
    但是毛主席就住在这里，在这里指挥着人民解放战争。这是他永远不能忘记的一天，他见到毛主席了，而且毛主席还给他们讲了话。
    毛主席讲话的地方是山顶上的一个老百姓打庄稼用的空场。毛主席穿着一件已经旧了的灰棉衣，脸色已被晒得有些黝黑，但精神十分饱满。
    毛主席告诉他们，党中央为什么要在陕北坚持斗争，又告诉他们，只有进行艰苦的斗争，革命才能胜利，将来革命不仅要在陕北取得胜利，还要在全中国取得胜利。
    那一次，对他的教育是多么深刻、鼓舞是多么大啊！他不仅对胜利更充满着信心，而且更懂得了必须用坚韧顽强的精神去争取胜利。从那时候起，他一直担负着保卫党中央、保卫毛主席的光荣任务。从那时候起，他们随着党中央和毛主席翻过多少高山峻岭，走过多少崎岖小路。每天晚上他都看到那些普通农民房屋里的闪闪的灯光，一直到深夜，有时一直到天亮，那是毛主席和其他中央负责同志在研究革命和国家的大事。现在，党中央和毛主席正在领导全国人民沿着社会主义的大道前进了。多少年的艰苦斗争，多少年的血汗，多少年斗争的宝贵经验，都凝结在这个宪法草案上……。
    张指导员一面在读，一面在想，宪法草案里每一个字，每一句话都和他的思想，他的过去的记忆融合在一起了。
    晚饭后张指导员召开了党的支部委员会，研究怎样学习和宣传宪法草案。他说：“有了宪法，我们以后的道路就更明确了！”
    第二天我去访问他时，他正在聚精会神地阅读宪法草案和人民日报社论，他细心地用红铅笔划出重要的地方，在他的面前，放着一本地图，地图上也有用红铅笔划出的一条曲折的红线，这条红线的起点是延安，它的终点就是我们的首都——北京。
      “我们的革命经过多少艰苦的斗争啊！”他激动地指着地图上那条红线对我说，显然他是想起了过去所走过的道路。这时窗外传来战士们愉快的呼喊声、唱歌声和手风琴声，从窗户望出去，是许多新建的高耸的楼房和许多高耸的建筑架。火车吼叫着，从不远的地方奔驰而过。
      “党中央和毛主席领导我们已经取得了这么大的胜利，”沉默了一会他又说：“我们建立了中华人民共和国，现在又在制订宪法，领导着我们逐步建设成社会主义。我们的任务就是要保卫这些胜利，要保卫首都，保卫毛主席！”
    天渐渐黑下来，操场上一片欢腾。警卫首都的战士们在欢庆中华人民共和国宪法草案的公布！
