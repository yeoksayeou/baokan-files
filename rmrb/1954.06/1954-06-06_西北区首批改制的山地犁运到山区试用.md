To improve agricultural production in mountainous areas, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government commissioned the Northwest Agricultural Implement Research Institute in 1952 to specifically undertake the design and research of mountain walking plows. Over the past two years, the institute has continuously conducted three research and improvement cycles on the basis of the mountain plows trial-produced by the original North China Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Plant, and distributed them to mountainous areas for testing, which has been very popular among the masses. Recently, modifications have been made based on the feedback and opinions of the masses. The first batch of modified mountain walking plows have been transported to mountainous areas in Inner Mongolia, East China, Central South China, Southwest China, Shanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai for more in-depth and comprehensive testing, and to solicit extensive opinions from the masses for future standardization reference.

    In order to take care of the characteristics of mountainous areas, some local modifications were made to the original plow during this trial production, and some unnecessary parts were simplified. For example, the wooden straight plow beam was changed to an iron curved plow beam, which not only shortened the length of the plow beam by a quarter, making it easier to turn flexibly on mountain slopes, but also eliminated the guide wheel, reducing the weight from 20 kilograms to 15.5 kilograms. Due to the increased plowshare, soil leakage was also reduced. The cost of this modified mountain plow is also 20% lower than in the past, not exceeding 200,000 yuan per unit, reducing the burden on farmers in mountainous areas. (Li Yunhu)

    西北区首批改制的山地犁运到山区试用
    中央人民政府农业部为了提高山区农业生产，于一九五二年曾责成西北农具研究所专门负责山地步犁的设计研究工作。两年来，该所在原华北农业机械制造总厂所试制的山地犁基础上，继续不断地作了三次研究和改进，并分发各地山区进行试验，很受群众欢迎。最近又根据群众的反映和意见进行了修改，首批改制的山地步犁已分别运往内蒙、华东、中南、西南和山西、甘肃、青海等地山区，作更深入更全面的试验，并广泛征求群众意见，以供作将来标定的参考。
    为了照顾山区特点，此次试制山地犁时将原犁作了某些局部的修改，简化了一些不必要的零件。如将木质直犁辕改成铁质弯犁辕，不但犁辕长度缩短了四分之一，便于山坡地头转弯灵活，且省去了导轮，使重量由二十公斤减到十五公斤半。由于加大了犁壁，也就减少了漏土现象。这次改制的山地犁成本也比过去降低了百分之二十，每部不超过二十万元，减轻了山区农民的负担。　（李运笏）
