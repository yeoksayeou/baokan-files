Some Experiences in Learning from Soviet Advanced Experiences and Implementing Soviet Experts' Suggestions
Jiang Tao

Earnestly and conscientiously learning from Soviet advanced experiences and resolutely implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts are extremely important factors in successfully completing our country's great economic construction tasks. This truth has been repeatedly proven by many facts. In the first quarter of this year, Shanghai enterprises, by learning from Soviet advanced experiences and implementing Soviet experts' suggestions, played a significant role in increasing output and quality, improving operational methods, reducing labor intensity, and leveraging existing equipment capacity, creating favorable conditions for the successful completion of the 1954 plan. In steel rolling: The New Shanghai Steel Plant adopted the measure of adding an intermediate furnace to the heating furnace, greatly improving the heating capacity of the furnace, increasing steel output by 24.7%, and solving the long-standing problem of the plant's heating capacity not keeping up with rolling needs and the disconnection between heating and rolling. Shanghai Steel Company's No. 2 Plant, by simply improving the heating furnace to increase output, will increase the output value by 3 billion yuan this year.

In steelmaking: The Asia Steel Plant's high-quality steel adopted the non-oxidation smelting method, shortening the oxidation time of 69 furnaces of high-quality steel by 46 hours and producing more than 30 tons of carbon steel. Shanghai Steel Company's No. 1 Plant used a checkerboard-type furnace roof repair in open-hearth furnaces, extending the furnace life from 190 heats to 244 heats. At the same time, the open-hearth furnace began planned smelting of small boiling steel, saving more than 10 billion yuan in deoxidized metal alone in the first quarter. The heat treatment time of castings in the foundry workshop of Shanghai Steel Company's No. 3 Plant has been shortened from 72 hours per cycle to 36 hours by adopting the normalizing operation method, doubling efficiency.

In the machine industry, Shanghai factories have widely studied and promoted the Kolesov tool method, which has played a significant role in improving the technology of the machine manufacturing industry and fulfilling and overfulfilling the state production plan. After the Shanghai Turbine Plant, the State-owned Textile Machinery No. 2 Plant, and the China Textile Machinery Plant implemented this tool method, the working efficiency of machine tools generally increased by one to three times, and in some cases, even increased to six times. Due to the implementation of the Kolesov tool method, the Shanghai Turbine Plant compressed the man-hour quota by 35% in the first quarter, and plans to compress it by another 18.8% in the second quarter.

In the textile industry, the State-owned Shanghai No. 9 and No. 12 Cotton Textile Plants have basically achieved success in learning from the Soviet advanced experience of "applying sodium silicate (i.e., water glass) as a decomposing agent in sizing." After adopting this method, the sizing rate can be reduced from about 14% to about 8%, and the amount of flour used per piece of cotton cloth can be saved by about 39% compared with the past. If this advanced experience is promoted in cotton spinning factories, it is estimated that more than 62,000 bags of flour (48 jin per bag) can be saved annually, and the cost can be reduced by more than 4 billion yuan, which is of great significance for saving grain. The saved grain, calculated at 1.5 jin of flour per person per day, can meet the needs of a factory with more than 5,000 employees for nearly a year. At present, Shanghai cotton spinning factories are actively promoting this advanced experience.

The study and promotion of Soviet advanced experiences and the implementation and execution of Soviet experts' suggestions in Shanghai factories have not only achieved important technological and economic achievements, but also greatly improved the ideological understanding of the broad masses of workers, further realizing the superiority of Soviet advanced experiences, gradually clarifying that learning from Soviet advanced experiences and implementing expert suggestions is an important link in continuously tapping the potential of enterprises, improving labor productivity, improving management, and reforming technology, thereby laying a solid ideological foundation for learning from Soviet advanced experiences.

Although Shanghai factories have achieved considerable success in learning from Soviet advanced experiences and implementing Soviet experts' suggestions, there are still many shortcomings and problems in this regard: some factory leaders have not paid enough attention to this work, and some leading cadres are not good at grasping this link; in some factories, experts have visited and made suggestions in the past, but some of these suggestions have not been implemented or have not been implemented well; many factories have organized the study of some Soviet advanced experiences, but have not studied them carefully, so some suggestions or advanced experiences have still not been implemented and executed; the already promoted experiences have not been promoted in a timely manner due to the lack of regular and planned inspection and summarization, and a series of problems in management, technology, and systems in some factories have not been solved in a timely manner.

Promoting Soviet advanced experiences and implementing Soviet experts' suggestions is an extremely meticulous and complex ideological and organizational work, and it is only possible to do it well through arduous efforts. Based on the situation of various factories carrying out this work, we have the following initial experiences:

I. The Party committee must strengthen the regular political and ideological leadership of the work of learning from Soviet advanced experiences and implementing and executing Soviet experts' suggestions. At present, most factories treat the implementation and execution of Soviet experts' suggestions and the learning of Soviet advanced experiences with importance and seriousness; however, some leading cadres, technicians, and technical workers still have rather serious complacency, conservatism, and empiricism. They pay little attention to Soviet experts' suggestions and advanced experiences, some even holding a skeptical attitude, and individual ones even have a confrontational mood. For example, when Soviet experts put forward six suggestions to the steel rolling workshop of the Jingyi Machine Factory on improving equipment and reducing fire loss, some employees of the factory put forward different degrees of opinions contrary to the suggestions on four of them at that time. In addition, some technicians will implement the expert's suggestions if they suit their own ideas, and will not implement or will not seriously implement the expert's suggestions if they conflict with their own understanding. Therefore, in the process of promoting Soviet advanced experiences and implementing Soviet experts' suggestions, the Party committee must frequently conduct ideological education for cadres, technicians, and workers, seriously criticize and resolutely overcome their complacency and conservative ideas, and must make all employees understand that in order to realize the country's socialist industrialization and to fulfill and overfulfill the country's production plan, learning from Soviet advanced experiences and implementing Soviet experts' suggestions is of decisive significance. It is necessary to fully understand that Soviet advanced experience is the summary of the wisdom of the Soviet working people in building socialism, and is the most advanced experience in the world. It is necessary to adopt a humble and honest learning attitude in order to lay the ideological foundation for promoting advanced experience and implementing expert suggestions.

II. The specific suggestions of Soviet experts are all put forward in response to the weak links and key issues existing in the production, technology, and business management of various factories. Therefore, the implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions and the promotion of Soviet advanced experience must be combined with the continued strengthening of planning management, technical management, and the establishment and improvement of various responsibility systems, in order to eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible for the work. The main method is to include the advanced experience or expert suggestions that are of decisive significance for solving the current key and weak links in production into the work plan, and to include the specific measures for realizing the advanced experience and expert suggestions into the enterprise's technical organization measures plan. In this way, the responsibilities of promotion from leaders to the masses and from management departments to technical departments are clarified, ensuring that the management work between various departments is comprehensively balanced, developed and improved.

III. Promoting advanced experience and implementing expert suggestions is an extremely complex and meticulous organizational work, and it is also a technical work with a high level of science. To do this work well, leaders at all levels must personally take action, be responsible at each level, and implement it level by level in order to achieve the expected results. For example, the suggestion of experts in the Shanghai Steel Company's No. 1 Plant to install two 72-cubic-meter blowers on the open-hearth furnace to increase air volume and shorten smelting time was because some leading cadres in the workshop accommodated the opinions of individual employees and initially changed the two blowers to one, and later simply removed even one. After repeated research by the leaders, it was believed that the installation of the blower could indeed shorten the smelting time, and it was decided that it must be reinstalled. After resolutely implementing it, the smelting time per heat was shortened by about 20 minutes, greatly increasing the output of steelmaking. Furthermore, due to the promotion of advanced experience and the implementation of expert suggestions, the improvement of certain equipment or the necessary expenses must also be supported by the leaders. In addition, it is also essential to mobilize workers and technicians to study Soviet advanced experiences and expert suggestions. The leaders should pay attention to frequently commending and rewarding those units and individuals who have made achievements in promoting Soviet advanced experience and implementing expert suggestions, and promptly summarize experience, widely publicize it, and vigorously promote it in order to set an example. When encountering difficulties, they should promptly mobilize the masses to focus on research and solutions in order to strengthen confidence. By doing this work well, the work experience of workers and technicians can be combined with the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, creatively applying and developing existing experience.

IV. Strengthening organizational leadership and establishing various responsibility systems for promoting Soviet advanced experience and implementing expert suggestions are also very necessary. The content and date of each expert suggestion must be recorded in detail, and a special person must be assigned to study, organize, and implement it. The implementation situation and effect of the suggestion must be regularly checked, and the difficulties in implementation must be resolved in a timely manner. The executors must have a high sense of political responsibility. The New Shanghai Steel Plant organized the expert suggestions according to the nature of production into three implementation groups: steel rolling, machinery and electrical, and MATE (likely relating to the Martin steel production process) to be responsible for carrying out the work separately, and included the implementation of the suggestions as one of the reporting contents at the weekend meeting, so as to frequently urge and check the implementation of the expert suggestions and ensure the smooth promotion of the expert suggestions.

In short, in the situation where the tasks of national economic construction are becoming increasingly complex and arduous, it is very important to earnestly study Soviet advanced experiences and implement Soviet expert suggestions. The leading cadres of factories and enterprises must list the leadership of this work as a regular task to ensure that the work of industrial construction is pushed forward.

    学习苏联先进经验和贯彻苏联专家建议的几点体会
    蒋涛
    切实认真的学习苏联先进经验和坚决贯彻执行苏联专家建议，是胜利完成我国伟大经济建设任务中一个极其重要的因素，这已经是一再被许多事实所证明了的一个真理。上海各企业今年第一季度通过学习苏联先进经验和贯彻执行苏联专家建议，在提高产量与质量，改进操作方法，减轻劳动强度，发挥现有设备能力等方面均起了很大的作用，为胜利完成一九五四年计划创造了良好的条件。在轧钢方面：新沪钢铁厂烘钢炉采用了增加腰炉的措施，大大的提高了烘钢炉的加热能力，钢材产量提高了百分之二四点七，解决了该厂长期未能解决的烘钢能力赶不上轧制需要、烘钢与轧钢脱节的问题；上海钢铁公司第二厂只改进烘炉提高产量一项，增加的产值今年即可达三十亿元。
    炼钢方面：亚细亚钢铁厂的优质钢采用不氧化冶炼法，六十九炉优质钢缩短了氧化时间四十六小时，多生产炭素钢三十余吨；上海钢铁公司第一厂平炉使用格子型炉顶挖修，炉子寿命由一九○炉延长至二四四炉，同时平炉开始有计划的冶炼小型沸腾钢，单脱氧金属一项第一季即节约一百余亿元；上海钢铁公司第三厂铸造车间铸件的热处理时间，由于采用了正火操作方法，已由过去七十二小时循环一次缩短到三十六小时，效率提高一倍。
    在机器工业方面，上海各厂较普遍的学习与推广了科列索夫车刀法，这对提高机器制造工业的技术，完成与超额完成国家生产计划起了很大作用。上海汽轮机厂，国营纺织机械二厂和中国纺织机械厂在推行了这一车刀法后，机床的工作效率一般提高了一倍至三倍，有的甚至提高到六倍；汽轮机厂第一季度由于推行科列索夫车刀法，压缩了工时定额百分之三五，第二季度准备再压缩百分之十八点八。
    在纺织工业方面，国营上海第九、十二两棉纺织厂学习苏联“在浆料中应用矽酸钠（即水玻璃）作为分解剂”的先进经验基本上已获成功，采用这种方法后，上浆率可由原来百分之十四左右降低到百分之八左右，每匹棉布的面粉用量比以前可节约百分之三九，这一先进经验如果在各棉纺厂推广后，估计全年可节约面粉六万二千余包（每包四八斤）并可降低成本四十余亿元，对于节约使用粮食具有重要的意义，所节余的粮食如以每人每日食用面粉一点五斤计算，可供一个具有五千多职工的工厂接近一年的需用。目前上海各棉纺厂正在积极推行这一先进经验。
    上海各厂学习与推广苏联先进经验，贯彻并执行苏联专家建议，不仅在技术上、经济上获得了重要成就，而且广大职工的思想认识也大大提高，进一步体会了苏联先进经验的优越性，逐渐明确了学习苏联先进经验贯彻专家建议，是今后不断挖掘企业潜力、提高劳动生产率、改进管理、革新技术的重要环节，进而奠定了学习苏联先进经验的巩固的思想基础。
    上海各厂学习苏联先进经验和贯彻执行苏联专家建议虽然获得了相当成绩，但这方面的缺点与问题仍然很多：有的厂领导上对这一工作还未引起足够重视，有些领导干部还不善于抓这一环节；某些厂以往专家去过并提过建议，但这些建议有的仍没有贯彻或贯彻的不好；不少厂曾组织学习过苏联的一些先进经验，但没有认真的学，因此有些建议或先进经验仍未能贯彻和执行；已经推行的经验也因缺乏经常的有计划的检查和总结，没有及时推广，若干工厂对管理上、技术上、制度上的一系列问题也没有及时解决。
    推广苏联先进经验，贯彻苏联专家建议是一项极为细致和复杂的思想工作和组织工作，必须经过艰苦的努力才有可能作好；根据各厂进行这一工作的情况，我们有以下几点初步体会：
    一、必须加强党委对学习苏联先进经验、贯彻和执行苏联专家建议这一工作的经常的政治思想领导。目前多数厂对待贯彻和执行苏联专家建议，学习苏联先进经验是重视的和认真的；但也有部分的领导干部、技术人员和技术工人还存在着相当严重的自满情绪、保守思想和经验主义，他们对于苏联专家建议和先进经验注意很差，有的还抱着一种怀疑的态度，个别的甚或有对抗情绪，例如苏联专家对精艺机器厂轧钢车间提出改进设备，降低火耗损失的六条建议，该厂某些职工当时对其中四条提出了不同程度的与建议相反的意见；另外某些技术人员是：专家建议适合于他自己的意思就执行，专家建议与他自己的认识有抵触就不执行或不认真执行。因此在推广苏联先进经验贯彻苏联专家建议的过程中，党委必须经常向干部、技术人员和工人反复进行思想教育，严肃批判与坚决克服他们中的自满情绪与保守思想，必须使全体职工了解：为了实现国家的社会主义工业化，为了完成和超额完成国家的生产计划，学习苏联先进经验与贯彻苏联专家建议是有着决定意义的；要充分认识苏联先进经验是苏联劳动人民建设社会主义的智慧的总结，是世界上最先进的经验，要抱着谦逊老实的学习态度，以奠定推广先进经验贯彻专家建议的思想基础。
    二、苏联专家的具体建议，都是针对各厂生产上技术上企业管理上存在的薄弱环节与关键问题提出来的，因此，贯彻苏联专家建议和推广苏联先进经验必须与继续加强计划管理，技术管理，建立和健全各项责任制度结合起来，以消灭工作中的无人负责现象。主要方法就是把解决当前生产关键和薄弱环节有决定意义的先进经验或专家建议列入作业计划，把实现先进经验和专家建议的具体措施，列入企业的技术组织措施计划中去，这样就明确了从领导到群众，从管理部门到技术部门推行中的责任，保证各部门之间的管理工作得到全面的平衡的发展和提高。
    三、推广先进经验和贯彻专家建议是一项极为复杂和细致的组织工作，也是具有高度科学水平的技术工作，要作好这一工作，必须各级领导干部亲自动手，逐级负责，层层贯彻，才能收到预期的效果。例如上海钢铁公司第一厂执行专家在平炉上安装两只七十二立方公尺的打风机以增加空气量缩短冶炼时间的建议，就是因为车间某些领导干部迁就个别职工的意见，开始把二只打风机改为一只，以后索性连一只也取掉了，经过领导上再三研究，认为装设打风机确实可使冶炼时间缩短，决定必须重新装置，坚决执行后，每炉冶炼时间缩短了二十分钟左右，大大的提高了炼钢的产量。再就是，由于推行先进经验贯彻专家建议，某些设备的改进或必需的费用亦须领导上给予支持。此外，发动工人技术人员学习苏联先进经验与专家建议也是十分必要的。领导上应注意经常表扬与奖励那些推行苏联先进经验和执行专家建议有成绩的单位与个人，并及时总结经验，广泛宣传，大力推广，以树立榜样，遇到困难应及时发动群众集中研究解决，以坚定信心。作好了这一工作，就可使工人、技术人员的工作经验和苏联的先进经验结合起来，创造性地运用和发展已有的经验。
    四、加强组织领导，订立推广苏联先进经验贯彻专家建议的各种责任制度也是十分必要的。专家每项建议内容和建议日期等，均须详细记录，责成专人研究组织执行，建议的执行情况与效果并须经常检查，执行中的困难亦应及时解决，必须使执行人员有高度的政治责任感。新沪钢铁厂曾将专家建议按生产性质分别组织了轧钢、机电、马铁三个执行小组分头负责进行工作，并在周末会议上把建议执行情况列为汇报内容之一，作到对专家建议贯彻情况的经常督促与检查，保证了专家建议的顺利推行。
    总之，在国家经济建设任务日益复杂和艰巨的情况下，认真的学习苏联先进经验，贯彻苏联专家建议是十分重要的，工厂企业的领导干部必须将这一工作的领导列为经常任务，保证把工业建设的工作推向前进。
