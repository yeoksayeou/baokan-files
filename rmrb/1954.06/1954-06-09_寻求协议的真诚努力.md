    A Sincere Effort to Seek Agreement
    By our reporter Wu Wentao
    Since the Geneva Conference began, the sincere efforts of China, North Korea and the Soviet Union to seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, and the United States' desperate obstruction of a peaceful resolution, have never been as starkly and clearly contrasted as they were at the meeting on June 5th.

    The discussions on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference have been going on for a full six weeks, and various different viewpoints and proposals have been put forward during the discussions. Public opinion generally believes that now is the time to seek a common ground for agreement from the different viewpoints and opinions. No one can deny that the Geneva Conference is a place to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue through consultation, not a place to impose the will of some on others. As long as there is sincerity in resolving the issue, seeking common ground to reach an agreement is not only necessary but also possible.

    It was based on this belief that Foreign Minister Nam Il made a completely reasonable proposal at the beginning of the Geneva Conference, which received strong support from China and the Soviet Union, and widespread sympathy from world public opinion. It is clear from the discussions that Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal not only conforms to the wishes of the Korean people who yearn for national reunification, but also to the wishes of the people of all countries who have children fighting in Korea, and also to the wishes of people all over the world who demand the guarantee of peace in the Far East and the easing of international tensions. Even so, China, North Korea and the Soviet Union did not demand that other countries accept the proposal in its entirety because of its rationality, but still listened to opinions from all sides with the greatest spirit of reconciliation and consultation, and answered the questions they raised, in order to reach an appropriate agreement on the basis of Nam Il's proposal. The proposal made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on May 22nd for the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to supervise the all-Korean elections is a concrete manifestation of this spirit of consultation.

    On June 5th, China, North Korea and the Soviet Union made significant new efforts in line with the universal desire of the people of the world to seek a common ground for agreement. Foreign Minister Nam Il declared in his speech: As for the opinions expressed here by some representatives regarding the gradual withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, we are not opposed to them in principle, as long as the principle of proportionality is observed in the process. We propose to hold concrete discussions on the date of withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea.

    Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out in his speech: A common ground for peacefully resolving the Korean issue can be found. He specifically pointed out: At our meeting, no one opposed the consolidation of peace in Korea, and everyone acknowledged that the purpose of the meeting was to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Most people believe that Korea should be unified. In order to achieve the unification of Korea, most people believe that free elections should be held throughout Korea. This election will also be conducted in accordance with the principle of population proportion. Even on the issue of the periodic withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Korea, only a small number of representatives expressed different opinions in principle. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai believes that since the meeting has these common grounds, it should make more efforts to seek concrete ways to solve the problem. He suggested that the meeting strive to reach an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue on the basis of the existing common ground.

    Foreign Minister Molotov, with an extremely objective and realistic attitude, made a pertinent analysis and summary of the opinions expressed by all parties during the debate on the issue of holding all-Korean elections, the issue of establishing all-Korean institutions for holding elections, the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea, the issue of international monitoring of elections, and the issue of international guarantees for the peaceful development of Korea. Foreign Minister Molotov specifically pointed out: The views of the various delegations on these issues have reached a certain degree of consensus. In order to bring the views of the countries closer together and reach mutually acceptable agreements on various principles, Foreign Minister Molotov put forward a draft resolution. This draft resolution affirmed the five basic principles that were stated during the debate and that could be agreed upon, while giving an opportunity to continue discussions on differing opinions. Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal fully demonstrated the sincerity of the Soviet delegation in seeking a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in the spirit of consultation.

    The efforts made by China, North Korea and the Soviet Union on June 5th made it clear to the whole world that the discussions on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference were not, as the United States had been propagating, on the verge of collapse and inevitable rupture, but that there were already many common grounds on which an agreement could be reached. As long as the delegations of all countries participating in the conference have the sincerity to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, it is entirely possible to reach an agreement. China, North Korea and the Soviet Union have shown the conference and the world with their concrete actions that they are willing to seek agreement with the greatest spirit of consultation.

    However, in contrast to the attitudes of the representatives of China, North Korea and the Soviet Union, the US representative still did not change his attitude of refusing consultation and stubbornly sticking to his own opinions. Apart from repeating the clichés that had been sung countless times, Smith neither put forward any constructive suggestions nor considered Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal. The common ground for reaching an agreement that already existed, as pointed out by Foreign Minister Molotov, apparently made the US representative, who was trying to obstruct any agreement, flustered, so that he even resorted to threatening to refuse to continue discussions at the meeting by any means necessary.

    However, facts have proved that Molotov's proposal, which reflects the wishes of peace-loving people all over the world, is one that no one can ignore. In the face of this proposal, all countries participating in the Geneva Conference will be severely tested as to whether they have the sincerity to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

### 寻求协议的真诚努力

    寻求协议的真诚努力
    本报记者　吴文焘
    自从日内瓦会议举行以来，朝、中、苏三国为谋求和平解决朝鲜问题而作的诚意的努力，与美国对于朝鲜问题和平解决的竭力阻挠，从来没有像在六月五日的会议上那样对照得如此强烈，如此明显。
    日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论，已经进行了整整六个星期，各种不同的观点与方案已经在讨论过程中被提了出来。公众舆论普遍认为，现在是从不同的观点和意见中间寻求协议的共同基础的时候了。没有人能够否认，日内瓦会议是通过协商的途径寻求和平解决朝鲜问题的地方，而不是来将某些人的意志强加于其他人的场所；只要具有解决问题的诚意，那末，寻求共同的基础以便取得协议就不仅是必要的，而且是可能的。
    正是基于这样的信念，南日外务相在日内瓦会议一开始的时候就提出了完全合理的建议，这个建议得到了中苏两国的坚决支持，和世界舆论的广泛同情。从讨论过程中可以清楚地看出，南日外务相的建议是既符合于渴望祖国统一的朝鲜人民的愿望，也符合于有子弟在朝鲜作战的各国人民的愿望，而且也符合于要求保障远东和平、缓和国际紧张局势的全世界人民的愿望的。纵然如此，朝、中、苏三国并没有因为这个建议的合理性而要求其他国家必须全盘接受，而仍然以最大的和解与协商的精神听取各方面的意见，答复他们提出的问题，以便在南日建议的基础上达成适当的协议。周恩来外长在五月二十二日提出的由中立国委员会监察全朝鲜选举的建议，就是这种协商精神的具体表现。
    六月五日，朝、中、苏三国顺应着世界人民所期待的、为协议寻求共同基础的普遍愿望，又作了重大的新的努力。南日外务相在他的发言中宣称：至于有些代表在这里表示过的一切外国军队从朝鲜逐渐撤退的意见，我们原则上并不反对，只要在这当中遵守按比例的原则。我们建议对一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的日期进行具体讨论。
    周恩来外长在他的发言中指出：和平解决朝鲜问题的共同基础是可以找到的。他具体地指出：在我们会议上，没有人反对朝鲜的和平应该得到巩固，并且大家承认，会议的目的是要达到朝鲜问题的和平解决的。大家多认为朝鲜应该统一。为实现朝鲜的统一，大家多认为应该举行全朝鲜的自由选举。这个选举并将要按照人口比例的原则进行。就是对于从朝鲜定期撤出一切外国武装力量的问题，也只有少数的代表在原则上表示了不同的意见。周恩来外长认为，会议既然有了这些共同基础，就更应该努力寻求具体解决问题的道路。他建议会议在已有的共同基础上，努力达成和平解决朝鲜问题的协议。
    莫洛托夫外长以极其客观和实事求是的态度，就辩论过程中在举行全朝鲜选举问题、为举行选举而建立的全朝鲜机构问题、从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队问题、国际机构监察选举问题、国际保证朝鲜和平发展问题上各方面所发表的意见，作了中肯的分析和归纳。莫洛托夫外长具体地指出：各代表团对这些问题的观点，有了一定程度的一致。为了使各国的观点趋于接近，并对各项原则达成互相可以接受的协议，莫洛托夫外长提出了一个决议草案。这个决议草案肯定了在辩论过程中表明了能够商定的五项基本原则，同时给予了就分歧的意见继续进行讨论的机会。莫洛托夫外长的建议充分表现了苏联代表团以协商的精神谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意。
    朝、中、苏三国六月五日所作的努力，使全世界清楚地看到了，日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论并不是如美国所宣传的那样，已经濒于绝境，非破裂不可，却原来已经有了许多可以据以求得协议的共同基础；只要参加会议的所有国家的代表团都抱有和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意，那末取得协议是完全可能的。朝、中、苏三国已经用自己的具体行动，向会议和全世界表明了它们是愿意以最大的协商精神来谋求协议的。
    但是和朝、中、苏三国代表的态度相反，美国代表却仍然不改他的拒绝协商、固执己见的态度。史密斯除了重复已经唱过不知多少遍的滥调以外，既没有提出任何建设性的意见，也毫不考虑莫洛托夫外长的建议。莫洛托夫外长所指出的业已存在的达成协议的共同基础，显然使力图阻挠达成任何协议的美国代表手忙脚乱，以致他竟然不择手段地以拒绝继续在会议上进行讨论相威胁。
    但是，事实已经证明，莫洛托夫的、反映了全世界爱好和平人民的愿望的建议，是任何人都不能加以漠视的；在这个建议面前，所有参加日内瓦会议的各国对和平解决朝鲜问题是否具有诚意，都将受到严重的考验。
