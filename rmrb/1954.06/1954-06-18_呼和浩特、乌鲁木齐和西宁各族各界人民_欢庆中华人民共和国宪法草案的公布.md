Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, June 17th: After the publication of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot, was filled with joy. On the morning of the 15th, before the Hohhot People's Broadcasting Station began broadcasting, many workers, cadres, students, and citizens waited quietly around radios and loudspeakers. Citizens of all ethnic groups rushed to buy the Inner Mongolia Daily; the newspaper sold 20,000 more copies that day. Many streets and alleys displayed eye-catching blackboards, and the Inner Mongolia People's Broadcasting Station began broadcasting in Mongolian. More than 1,300 propagandists who had studied the draft in advance quickly launched propaganda activities, some using loudspeakers to broadcast in the streets or on rooftops, others going door-to-door to promote it to each household. Many citizens, after hearing the propaganda, automatically gathered to read and discuss the Draft Constitution. Mongolian woman Jin Mei said during the discussion: "In the old society, women couldn't even make decisions in their own families. Now we are discussing the fundamental law of the country, this is true democracy." Workers in the ironworking team led by Gao Shunmeng, a national model worker, greeted the good news by overfulfilling their work tasks for the day. Members of the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs bought more than forty additional copies of the newspaper than usual, reading them in the fields during work breaks. Representatives attending the Hohhot Hui Autonomous Region People's Representative Conference, which was in session, were immediately excited upon hearing the news. After discussing the Draft Constitution, they unanimously passed a resolution of support. Manchu elder Zhao Shulong said: I have lived for more than sixty years and have never been so happy. In the past, there were this law and that law, but none of them were laws that treated all ethnic groups equally. Now it is very different. Ma Cheng (Ahong), a member of the China Islamic Association, and Dawa, a Lama of Shelitu Temple, were particularly pleased with the explicit provision for freedom of religious belief in the Draft Constitution, and both expressed their enthusiastic support. Sun Lanfeng, Deputy Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Consultative Committee, and Boyan Mandu, Director of the Counselor's Office of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government, recalled the humiliation of ethnic minorities under the pseudo-constitution of the old society and said: The publication of the Draft Constitution is a great joy in the political life of the people of all ethnic groups in China, and it is a guarantee of the happy life of the people of all ethnic groups.

Xinjiang Daily Special Dispatch: The news of the publication of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has inspired the people of all ethnic groups in Urumqi. Workers of all ethnic groups at the Xinjiang October Automobile Repair Factory and the repair factory of the state-owned Xinjiang Transportation Company gathered around the radio to listen to the contents of the Draft Constitution as soon as they got off work. The October Automobile Repair Factory also held a discussion meeting that day. Labor model Liu Kang (Han nationality) said: "This Draft Constitution was obtained by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party after years of arduous struggle. We must use the practical action of overfulfilling the national production plan to support the Draft Constitution." Haimidula (Uyghur nationality), a labor model at the repair factory of the state-owned Xinjiang Transportation Company, said excitedly after seeing the Draft Constitution: "The Draft Constitution stipulates that all ethnic groups are equal, and stipulates that citizens have the right to work and workers have the right to rest. Such a constitution was unimaginable before liberation." Ma Quanlu (Hui nationality), leader of the model mutual aid team in Tougong Village, Tuanjie Township, in the suburbs of the city, also excitedly stated that he would support the Draft Constitution with the practical action of producing more grain and supporting the country's industrial construction.

Responsible persons of various people's organizations in Urumqi also made speeches one after another, unanimously supporting the Draft Constitution. Yiming Mahesumu, Deputy Director of the China Islamic Association, said: He will earnestly study and discuss the Draft Constitution and strive to welcome the birth of the first constitution of the Chinese people.

Qinghai Daily Special Dispatch: The people of all ethnic groups in Xining City welcome the Draft Constitution with infinite excitement. Zhan Naikun, an industrial labor model at the Xining People's Power Plant, said excitedly: "The Draft Constitution makes us realize that the responsibility of the working class is even greater, and we must work harder to complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party and the people." Li Dexiang, an agricultural labor model in Qinghai Province, said: "Every sentence of the Draft Constitution speaks to our hearts. We must discuss it carefully." Ma Tingzhen, an agricultural labor model in the Xining Dongguan Hui Autonomous Region, expressed his desire to mobilize all members of the mutual aid team to discuss and publicize the Draft Constitution. The Qinghai Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a cadres' meeting on the day the Draft Constitution was published to celebrate its publication. At the meeting, Dai Jinpu, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Military Region, called on all cadres to seriously discuss this document. The Qinghai Provincial Consultative Committee and the Qinghai Provincial People's Government Ethnic Affairs Committee held a discussion meeting on the 16th. Ma Wending (Hui nationality), Long Zhou (Mongolian nationality), Agu Duojie (Tibetan nationality) and other members spoke at the meeting, unanimously expressing their warm welcome to the Draft Constitution.
