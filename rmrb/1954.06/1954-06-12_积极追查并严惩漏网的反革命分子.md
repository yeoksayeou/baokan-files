Actively Pursue and Severely Punish Counter-Revolutionary Elements Who Have Escaped the Net

The People's Public Security Organs of Hebei Province, with the active assistance of the broad masses, and after a relatively short period of investigation, successively cracked three major counter-revolutionary cases, and rounded up fifty counter-revolutionary bandits who were active in the Beijing-Tianjin-Baoding triangular area of ​​four or five hundred miles. The cracking and handling of these three cases, on the one hand, shows the consolidation of our people's democratic dictatorship, and that any counter-revolutionary elements who dare to continue to engage in sabotage and disruption will inevitably be severely punished by the state law; on the other hand, it also shows that in the period when the country has entered a planned and large-scale economic construction, we must redouble our revolutionary vigilance and continue to resolutely fight against counter-revolutionary elements and other saboteurs in order to ensure the smooth progress of the country's economic construction and the safety of the people's lives and property.

In recent years, after various social reform movements, especially after the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the remaining counter-revolutionary forces have been severely hit, and the social order in our country has been greatly consolidated. However, this does not mean that all counter-revolutionary elements have been completely eliminated, and counter-revolutionary activities have completely disappeared. On the contrary, today, whether in rural or urban areas, there are still a group of escaped counter-revolutionary elements hiding, and they are constantly looking for various gaps and taking advantage of various opportunities to carry out criminal activities that endanger the interests of the country and the people. The principal criminals in these three cases, Han Yushu, Han Yuhua, and Yang Bingli, were all counter-revolutionary elements who had escaped the net and were covered in blood debts. As early as before the "July 7th" Incident, Han Yushu and Han Yuhua had gathered landlords, hooligans, and demobilized soldiers to organize the so-called "Big Robbery Household," engaging in the criminal acts of harming the country and the people. After their criminal activities were discovered by the hired worker Liu Wanrong, the Han bandits, fearing the exposure of the truth, inhumanly buried Liu Wanrong alive. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, these counter-revolutionary bandits relied on the Japanese and puppet troops and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs to frantically kill our district village cadres and activist masses in Gu'an, Xincheng, and Zhuoxian. According to the materials that have been verified, Han Yushu and others shot and buried alive 19 village cadres and activist masses in our district, and the seven members of farmer Han Dexiu's family were all killed by them at one time. The Yang bandit Bingli and the Wang bandit Yongsheng successively captured and killed five of our village cadres and activist masses. After the national liberation, these counter-revolutionary bandits not only did not have any remorse, but instead became even more rampant in carrying out sabotage and disruption. The Han bandit Yushu gathered twenty people, including remnants of the enemy and puppets and reactionary landlords and rich peasants, to form an armed robbery group, which was active in the Beijing-Tianjin-Baoding triangular area. In the past four years, they have carried out as many as forty-five robberies and highway robberies, seriously endangering the safety of the people's lives and property. Yang Bandit Bingli and others, under the direct command of the North China counter-revolutionary bandit leaders Yuan Shilong and Fan Shulin, established the so-called "Hebei Provincial Anti-Communist National Construction Army." They had repeatedly developed organizations in our industrial, mining, financial, and other departments, infiltrated our rural grass-roots regime and militia armed forces, and conspired to seize the guns of our militia, rob our grain and funds for repairing the Gu'an Bridge, and prepare to cooperate with the US imperialist war of aggression against Korea and seize the opportunity to carry out armed riots. These counter-revolutionary elements who are guilty of heinous crimes and refuse to repent must be severely suppressed and thoroughly eliminated.

These three cases prove that among the landlords who have been overthrown, there are still some elements who are determined to be enemies of the people. They directly collude with counter-revolutionary elements to jointly carry out sabotage and disruption activities. The criminal activities of the Han bandit Yushu and the Yang bandit Bingli and others were carried out with the active participation and assistance of landlords and rich peasants who insisted on their reactionary stand. The reactionary landlord Cheng Wentang and others repeatedly harbored the Han bandit, providing Han bandit with information, sending money, and sending food. The reactionary rich peasant Xu Wenshan opened a coal shop in Beijing in order to raise funds for the Yang bandit Bingli's counter-revolutionary activities, and served as the Yang bandit's "quartermaster." The reactionary landlord Jiang Rongjia colluded with hooligans such as Shao Yushan, who had always been engaged in theft and rape of women, and damaged and stole the state's power lines twenty-five times. These bad elements such as landlords and rich peasants who actively participated in counter-revolutionary activities must also be severely punished.

If we are satisfied with the achievements of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in the past few years, satisfied with the achievements in the country's construction cause, and therefore become arrogant and complacent, and relax our revolutionary vigilance, we will inevitably give counter-revolutionary elements, reactionary landlord class elements, and various local ruffians and other bad elements the opportunity to disrupt and sabotage, causing significant losses to the interests of the state and the people, and making it impossible for our production and construction cause to proceed smoothly. And after these counter-revolutionary bandits were arrested by us and suppressed, the broad masses of the people warmly supported them, unanimously praised the People's Government for doing a good job, and said that it should have been done long ago. The local work immediately showed a new atmosphere, and the broad masses of the people more actively stood up to fight against counter-revolutionary elements and reactionary landlords.

In order to further consolidate revolutionary order and protect the country's economic construction and the safety of the people, in addition to promptly detecting and severely suppressing the special agents and spies sent by the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret service agencies or directly or indirectly commanded by them, we must continue to fight against all escaped counter-revolutionary elements. These escaped counter-revolutionary elements, if they sincerely repent and voluntarily surrender themselves, can be treated leniently; if they still resist to the end and refuse to surrender themselves voluntarily, we should call on and rely on the broad masses of the people to resolutely track them down and severely punish them all; those who harbor these bandits should also be punished by law; and we must strengthen the fight against all criminal offenses. In recent years, due to the neglect of this aspect of the struggle by the People's Public Security Organs in some areas, some criminal cases of theft, fraud, robbery, arson, homicide, and rape of women have occurred one after another in both rural and urban areas. Among these criminal offenders, many are counter-revolutionary elements, and some are bad elements such as local ruffians, hooligans, habitual thieves, and habitual burglars left over from the old society. Although many of these dregs left over from the old society have reformed and engaged in legitimate labor and production after several years of education and transformation by the People's Government, there are still some who are destructive and determined not to repent. Liu Yinghao, a habitual bandit executed by the Shenyang Municipal People's Government not long ago, had been engaged in robbery since the puppet Manchukuo period, and continued to win over other bad elements to carry out robbery after the liberation of Shenyang. Zuo Zongpu, a habitual thief executed by the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, had been engaged in organized theft activities along the Pinghan and other railways since 1942. Although he had been repeatedly detained and educated by the People's Government after national liberation, he still engaged in theft in Shanghai and Wuhan. We should realize that although these saboteurs do not have counter-revolutionary organizational ties, their activities are also counter-revolutionary in nature. Therefore, we must also severely punish such criminal offenders in accordance with the laws of the state.

In the future, the People's Public Security Organs must strengthen the investigation and detection work on all counter-revolutionary sabotage activities and criminal offenses; they must earnestly mobilize and rely on the broad masses of the people and give full play to their enthusiasm for fighting counter-revolutionary elements. In this process of pursuing and arresting the Han bandit Yushu and others, the People's Public Security personnel demonstrated a heroic and tenacious spirit, but without the active support and assistance of the broad masses, without the masses' reports and accusations, without the militia's guidance, and without the boatmen's disregard for the cold weather and rushing to help the public security personnel, it would have been impossible to arrest all the counter-revolutionary bandits who had fled within a radius of four or five hundred miles in half a month. These model people's masses and model public security personnel should be commended by the People's Government at the same time.

### 积极追查并严惩漏网的反革命分子

    积极追查并严惩漏网的反革命分子
    河北省人民公安机关在广大群众的积极协助之下，经过一个较短时期的侦察，连续破获了三个重大的反革命案件，一网打尽了流窜活动于京、津、保三角地带方圆四、五百里内的五十名反革命匪徒。这三个案件的破获和处理，一方面说明了我国人民民主专政的巩固，任何反革命分子如果敢于继续从事破坏和捣乱，就必然要受到国家法律的严厉制裁；另一方面也说明了，在国家已进入有计划的大规模的经济建设的时期，我们更必须百倍地提高革命警惕性，继续坚决地和反革命分子及其他破坏分子作斗争，才能保障国家经济建设的顺利进行，保障人民生命财产的安全。
    最近几年来，经过各种社会改革运动，特别是经过大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动，沉重地打击了残余反革命的势力，我国社会治安已经大大地巩固了。但是，这并不是说反革命分子已经全部消灭了，反革命的活动已经完全绝迹了。相反的，今天不论在农村或城市中，都还暗藏着一批逃亡漏网的反革命分子，他们每时每刻都在寻找各种空隙，利用各种机会，进行危害国家和人民利益的犯罪活动。这三个案件中的主犯韩玉树、韩玉华和杨秉礼等人，都是血债累累的漏网反革命分子。远在“七七”事变以前，韩玉树和韩玉华就曾纠集地主、流氓、兵痞，组织了所谓“大抢户”，干着祸国殃民的罪恶勾当。在他们的犯罪活动被雇工刘万荣发觉以后，韩匪惟恐暴露真象，竟惨无人道地把刘万荣活埋了。在抗日战争和解放战争时期，这些反革命匪徒投靠了日伪军和蒋介石匪帮，在固安、新城、涿县
  一带疯狂地杀害我区村干部和群众积极分子。仅据已经查清的材料统计，韩匪玉树等人就曾枪杀、活埋我区村干部和群众十九人，农民韩德修一家七口被他们一次杀光。杨匪秉礼和王匪永生曾先后捕杀了我村干部和群众积极分子五人。全国解放以后，这些反革命匪徒不但毫无悔祸之心，反而更加嚣张地进行破坏和捣乱。韩匪玉树纠集敌伪残余分子和反动地主富农等二十人，组成武装抢劫集团，流窜活动于京、津、保三角地带，四年之中抢劫、路劫达四十五次之多，严重地危害了人民生命财产的安全。杨匪秉礼等人则在华北反革命匪首袁世隆、樊树林的直接指挥下，成立了所谓“河北省反共建国军”。他们曾数次在我工矿、财经等部门发展组织，混进了我农村基层政权和民兵武装，阴谋夺取我民兵的枪枝，抢劫我兴修固安大桥的粮款，准备配合美帝国主义的侵朝战争，伺机进行武装暴乱。对于这样罪大恶极、怙恶不悛的反革命分子，必须予以严厉镇压和彻底消灭。
    这三个案件证明，在已被打倒的地主阶级中，至今还有一些坚决与人民为敌的分子，他们直接和反革命分子勾结起来，共同进行捣乱和破坏活动。韩匪玉树和杨匪秉礼等人的罪恶活动，就是在坚持反动立场的地主、富农等的积极参加和协助之下进行的。反动地主程文堂等，就曾一再地窝藏韩匪，为韩匪通风、报信、送钱、送粮。反动富农徐文山为了替杨匪秉礼筹集反革命活动经费，在北京开设了一个煤铺，并自任杨匪的“军需官”。反动地主姜荣嘉则勾结拉拢一贯从事盗窃和强奸妇女的流氓邵玉山等坏分子，先后破坏、盗窃国家的电线二十五次。对于这一些积极参加反革命活动的地主、富农等坏分子，也必须从严予以惩治。
    如果我们满足于几年来镇压反革命运动的成绩，满足于国家建设事业上的成就，并因此骄傲麻痹起来，松懈了自己的革命警惕性，就必然给予反革命分子、反动地主阶级分子和各种地痞流氓等坏分子以捣乱破坏的机会，使国家和人民的利益遭受重大损失，使我们的生产建设事业不能顺利地进行。而在这些反革命匪徒被我逮捕并受到镇压以后，广大群众无不热烈拥护，一致称赞人民政府办得好，早就应该这样办，地方的工作立即出现了新的气象，广大群众更积极地起来和反革命分子、反动地主作斗争。
    为了进一步巩固革命秩序，保障国家的经济建设和人民的安全，我们除了必须及时地破获和严厉地镇压美蒋特务机关所派遣来的或他们直接间接指挥的特务间谍以外，还必须继续和一切逃亡漏网的反革命分子作斗争。这些逃亡漏网的反革命分子，如果真诚悔改，并自动投案，就可以从宽处理；如果他们还要顽抗到底，不肯自动投案，就应号召和依靠广大群众，坚决把他们追查出来，一律从严惩办；窝藏这些匪犯的人，也应同样受到法律的制裁；并且要加强和一切刑事犯罪行为作斗争。近年来，由于部分地方的人民公安机关忽视了这方面的斗争，不论在农村或城市中，都陆续发生了一些偷盗、诈骗、抢劫、纵火、凶杀以及强奸妇女的犯罪案件。在这些刑事犯罪分子中，有不少就是反革命分子，有一些则是旧社会遗留下来的地痞、流氓、惯盗、惯窃等坏分子。这些旧社会遗留下来的渣滓，经过几年来人民政府的教育改造，虽然其中已有很多人改邪归正，从事正当的劳动生产；但是也还有一些人破坏成性，坚决不肯悔改。不久以前沈阳市人民政府处决的惯匪刘英豪，从伪满时期开始就一贯进行抢劫，沈阳市解放后仍继续拉拢其他坏分子进行抢劫。武汉市人民政府所处决的惯窃左宗普，从一九四二年起就在平汉等铁路沿线从事有组织的盗窃活动，全国解放后虽经人民政府一再管押教育，而他仍然先后在上海和武汉等地从事偷窃。我们应该认识到，这些破坏分子虽然没有反革命的组织关系，但是他们的活动同样是反革命的性质。因此，对于这样的刑事犯罪分子，我们也必须依据国家的法律严厉地加以惩处。
    今后人民公安机关必须加强对于一切反革命破坏活动和刑事犯罪的侦察破案工作；要认真发动和依靠广大人民群众，充分发挥他们对反革命分子斗争的积极性。在这次追捕韩匪玉树等人的过程中，人民公安人员表现了英勇顽强的精神，但是如果没有广大群众的积极支持和协助，没有群众的检举和告发，没有民兵的带路，没有船工不顾天寒地冻抢渡公安人员，要想在半个月内把逃窜在方圆四、五百里以内的反革命匪徒全部逮捕归案，那是不可能的。这些模范的人民群众应和模范的公安人员同时受到人民政府的表扬。
