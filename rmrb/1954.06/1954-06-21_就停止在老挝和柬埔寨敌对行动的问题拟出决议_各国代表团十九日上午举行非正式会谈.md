Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 19th. This correspondent reports: Informal talks were held here this morning between delegations to draft a resolution on the meeting of representatives of the two sides' command headquarters in Geneva or in Laos and Cambodia to discuss the cessation of hostilities in these two countries. If an agreement is reached, the afternoon meeting will adopt this resolution.

Observers here point out that it is entirely possible to reach an agreement in principle to accelerate detailed discussions, as long as there is no American interference to obstruct the agreement. On the 18th, the United States' deliberate obstructionist tactics were displayed once again. The U.S. State Department ordered U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson to reject the constructive new proposals on the Laotian and Cambodian issues put forward by the Chinese delegation. U.S. delegation leader Smith had said that the Chinese proposal was "moderate and reasonable." On the 18th, he made an excuse to go to Bern to evade the meeting. Robertson came forward to reject the Chinese proposal, saying it was "unreasonable and unacceptable" and "had nothing new in it."

This is clearly another rude attempt by the United States to obstruct discussions on the Indochina issue just when there is hope of reaching a proper agreement. All other delegations agreed that the Chinese proposal could serve as a basis for discussion. The London "Times" said on the 19th: "There is no doubt that the conference made important progress on the issue of Laos and Cambodia this week, although some U.S. representatives rejected" the proposals of the Chinese, Soviet, and Democratic Republic of Vietnam delegations.

A prominent feature of the conference is that, on the one hand, delegations are working to reach an agreement in Geneva; on the other hand, Washington is issuing orders to obstruct the agreement. The French delegation considered the Chinese proposal to be "positive" and worthy of study. A British spokesman believed the proposal could lead to a solution. But Washington said "no." The London "Daily Telegraph" reported: "U.S. spokesmen do not give up any opportunity to make others think that the U.S. delegation is in Geneva in a nearly 'observer'-like unrelated capacity," and threatened that it might "not participate" in any agreement reached at the conference.

This is consistent with the United States' strategy of rejecting all proposals. When they can no longer obstruct the agreement, they "do not participate" and reserve the right to sabotage it. For several weeks, the U.S. delegation obstructed agreement on the procedures for discussing the Indochina issue, but when Eden put forward a compromise plan on the procedure, the U.S. State Department ordered Smith neither to accept nor to publicly oppose it. Later, the U.S. delegation issued a statement reserving the right to reject the agreements reached.

The Geneva Conference has already been filled with a record of the United States' conspiracies to obstruct agreements and make contradictory statements. Outside the conference, U.S. propaganda clamors that the conference will fail due to no concessions. But at the conference, the U.S. delegation has not put forward a single proposal in eight weeks. When British newspapers admitted that there had been "genuine concessions," Robertson said they were "unacceptable."

At the last meeting to discuss the Korean issue, Smith rejected the Soviet proposal—namely, that the countries participating in the Geneva Conference agree "not to take any action that might threaten the maintenance of peace in Korea," on the grounds that this was already included in the Korean Armistice Agreement. After the meeting, the Rhee Syngman's Foreign Minister announced that the armistice agreement was no longer binding or effective. The U.S. delegation refused to comment on or deny this statement. Obviously, the Pentagon wants to be able to take aggressive actions in Korea as it pleases once it is ready.

The United States' obstruction is once again threatening the conference. But the Geneva Conference has also shown that progress can be made if all directly concerned countries are genuinely willing to reach an agreement. If the forces for peace in the world, especially the forces for peace in France, resolutely demand a swift solution to the Indochina issue, the United States' actions to obstruct the conference can be thwarted, and an agreement can be reached.

### 就停止在老挝和柬埔寨敌对行动的问题拟出决议  各国代表团十九日上午举行非正式会谈

    就停止在老挝和柬埔寨敌对行动的问题拟出决议
    各国代表团十九日上午举行非正式会谈
    【新华社日内瓦十九日电】本社特派记者报道：这里的代表团之间十九日上午举行了非正式会谈，就双方司令部代表在日内瓦或在老挝和柬埔寨会晤以讨论在这两个国家内停止敌对行动的问题拟出决议。假如取得协议，下午的会议将通过这个决议。
    这里的观察家指出：现在只要没有美国的干涉来阻挠协议，那末在原则上取得协议以加速详细的讨论是完全可能的。在十八日，美国蓄意阻挠的策略再一次显示出来了。美国国务院命令美国助理国务卿罗伯逊拒绝中国代表团就老挝和柬埔寨问题提出的建设性的新建议。美国代表团团长史密斯曾说：中国的建议是“温和的、合理的”。十八日，他借故到伯尔尼去而逃避了会议。罗伯逊出面拒绝了中国的建议，说它是“不合理的和不能接受的”，并且“没有什么新内容”。
    这显然是正当协议有希望达成的时候，美国企图阻挠印度支那问题的讨论的另一次粗鲁的行为。而所有别的代表团都同意中国的建议可以作为讨论的基础。伦敦“泰晤士报”十九日说：“没有疑问，会议这个星期在老挝和柬埔寨的问题上有了重要的进展，虽然某些美国代表拒绝了”中国、苏联和越南民主共和国代表团的建议。
    会议突出的特点是：一方面各代表团在为争取在日内瓦达成协议而努力；另一方面，华盛顿却在发布阻挠协议的命令。法国代表团认为中国的建议是“积极的”，值得加以研究。英国发言人认为建议可能导致解决。但是华盛顿却说“不”。伦敦“每日电讯报”报道：“美国发言人不放弃任何机会要别人想到，美国代表团是以差不多像‘观察员’一样没有关系的身份来日内瓦的”，并威胁说它可能“不参加”会议上所达成的任何协议。
    这是和美国的拒绝一切建议的策略一致的。在不再能够阻挠协议的时候，它们就“不参加”，并保留破坏的权利。有好几个星期，美国代表团阻挠在讨论印度支那问题的程序上达成协议，但是在艾登就程序提出折衷计划的时候，美国国务院就命令史密斯既不要接受也不要公开反对它。后来美国代表团发表声明要保留拒绝所达成的协议的权利。
    日内瓦会议已经充满了美国为阻挠协议而进行阴谋诡计和发表自相矛盾的声明的纪录。在会外，美国的宣传吵嚷说，由于没有让步，会议将要失败。但是在会议上，在八个星期里面美国代表团一个建议也没有提出来。当英国报纸承认已经有了“真正的让步”的时候，罗伯逊又说它们是“不能接受的”。
    在讨论朝鲜问题的最后一次会议上，史密斯拒绝了苏联的建议——就是由参加日内瓦会议的国家协议“不得采取任何可能足以对维持朝鲜和平构成威胁的行动”的建议，他的借口是在朝鲜停战协定中已经有了这一项。在会后，李承晚的外务部长官宣布说停战协定不再有束缚力，也不再有效了。美国代表团拒绝评论或否认这个声明。显然，五角大楼想在准备好了以后能畅所欲为地在朝鲜采取侵略行动。
    美国的阻挠再一次地威胁着会议。但是日内瓦会议也表明了：假如一切直接有关国家真正愿意协议的话，是能够获得进展的。假如世界要求和平的力量，尤其是法国的和平力量坚决要求迅速解决印度支那问题，美国阻挠会议的行动是可以挫败的，协议是可以达成的。
