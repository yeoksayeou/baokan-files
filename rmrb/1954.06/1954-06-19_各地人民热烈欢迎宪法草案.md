    People Across the Country Warmly Welcome the Draft Constitution
    Nanjing City
    When the news of the draft constitution reached Nanjing, people rushed to read the newspaper that day. The post office sold more than 80,000 copies of the Xinhua Daily on that day. A worker from the Xiaguan Power Plant went to Xinjiekou before dawn to buy 50 copies of the newspaper, and 82-year-old Grandpa Cao also went to the post office with his cane to buy a copy. After seeing the draft constitution, the employees of the Nanjing Bulb Factory were filled with joy in every workshop. In the early days of liberation, this factory could only produce some ordinary light bulbs, but now it can produce various special light bulbs. Labor productivity has been increasing year by year, and the lives of employees have also been improving day by day.
    Gao Wenhai, a tractor driver at the No. 7 District Machine Tractor Station in Nanjing, read the newspaper and said happily: "The constitution fixes the victorious achievements of the people's struggle into law and points out the way forward, which gives us more confidence to work." He said to the young farmers who were learning to drive tractors from him, "I will definitely teach you everything I know, so that you can become tractor drivers soon."
    From morning to noon, the broadcasting stations of various universities in Nanjing continuously broadcast news about the draft constitution. Teachers and students of Nanjing No. 1 Girls' Middle School wrote a blackboard newspaper celebrating the draft constitution as early as 9:00 p.m. on the 14th. After reading the newspaper, the professors of the Agronomy Department of Nanjing Agricultural College also encouraged each other: we must carefully read and discuss the draft constitution, so that we can better strive to cultivate talents for the construction of the motherland in the future.
    After seeing the draft constitution, the cadres of various agencies in Nanjing felt the importance of their responsibilities even more. Some comrades also connected it with their own work and promised to improve their work in the future and be models of law-abiding citizens. Cui Ling, a judge of the Municipal People's Court, said: "The draft constitution stipulates that our responsibilities are so important and our tasks are so glorious. We must seriously study the draft constitution and complete our glorious tasks."
    Fuzhou City
    The 500,000 people of Fuzhou welcomed the draft constitution with excitement. On the morning of the 15th, more than 300 loudspeakers throughout the city broadcast the content of the draft constitution in Fuzhou dialect and Southern Fujian dialect. After the Fujian Daily was published, people flocked to post offices and newspaper kiosks to buy newspapers. The number of newspapers issued increased by more than 23,000 copies compared to usual. Zhan Changsen, director of the Mechanic Workshop of Fuzhou Repair Factory, said after reading the newspaper: "I was a worker for 25 years before liberation and suffered all the time. After liberation, I became the director of the workshop. The new society allows us workers to be masters of our own affairs. Today, the first article of the draft constitution affirms the leadership of our working class." Xu Zhangcheng, director of the Fenghu Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Fuzhou, told all the cooperative members after conveying the news: "As long as you look at the good rice seedlings growing in the cooperative this year, the water pumps installed in the village, and the threshing machines placed in the houses, and compare them with the life before liberation, you can think of the correctness of the cooperative path."
    More than 100 graduates of the Fujian Normal College Affiliated Workers' and Peasants' Secondary School, who are preparing to take the college entrance examination, were particularly excited. Zong Liankui said: The new society has turned me from a semi-illiterate person who originally only knew more than 200 characters into a high school graduate. This time, the draft constitution also makes explicit provisions for citizens' right to education, which is a great encouragement to us young students. I will definitely use practical actions to welcome the birth of the first constitution of New China.
    Hangzhou City
    The people of Hangzhou were jubilant and warmly welcomed the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China. The newspaper boards by the West Lake were surrounded by people reading the news from morning to night. The blackboard newspapers of various factories all reported this good news with large-character headlines. A news reporting team composed of fifty or sixty workers from the state-owned Zhejiang Flax Textile Factory was active in the factory. Zhu Hanchang, a worker and labor model of the state-owned Hangzhou Universal Machinery Factory, proposed to guarantee the completion of the June production task to celebrate the promulgation of the draft constitution, which was echoed by all the workers in the group. Labor models and advanced workers who were recuperating in the China Postal and Telecommunications Trade Union Sanatorium by the beautiful West Lake excitedly discussed this great event that had never happened in history after hearing the news about the draft constitution from the radio. They carefully read the draft constitution published in the newspaper and held a small discussion. You Jianren, an elderly postal and telecommunications worker in Yong'an County, Fujian Province, said: In the past, we workers did not know what rest was. After liberation, the government established hospitals, sanatoriums, and recuperation centers. Now, the draft constitution explicitly stipulates that workers have the right to work, enjoy rest, and receive material assistance in old age. Only our own government and our own constitution can care for us like this. Wang Changlin, a line worker who has worked in the Shanghai Telephone Company for more than 30 years, also said: Now we have hospitals, a vacation system, and we can come to the beautiful West Lake to recuperate. The draft constitution also stipulates that we will gradually expand the material conditions for workers' rest and recuperation, which is something we never dreamed of in the past. When the news reached the Longjing tea area near the West Lake, where summer tea was being produced, the tea farmers were extremely excited. Wang Genda, deputy leader of the Shifeng Mutual Aid Group, immediately read the draft constitution to the members one by one. Everyone said: The country is really thinking about us working people everywhere! (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    Changsha City
    The news of the promulgation of the draft constitution attracted the day's life of more than 600,000 people in Changsha to this great event. The workers of the Third Power Plant of the Xiangzhong Electric Power Bureau who had already finished their work were waiting for the day's newspaper at the factory gate. After work, the female workers of Yuxiang Yarn Factory immediately rushed to the dispatch room to read the newly arrived newspaper. In the flowerbeds, corridors, and open spaces, the voices of workers reading the newspaper could be heard everywhere. When the newspaper was delivered to the Hunan Branch of the China Native Produce Company, the band organized by the employees themselves played the national anthem, and applause, firecrackers, and cheers intertwined. Nearby residents also rushed to celebrate the promulgation of the draft constitution with the employees. When the students of Changsha No. 1 Girls' Middle School read the provision in the draft constitution that "the state pays special attention to the physical and intellectual development of young people," everyone cheered happily. After reading the draft constitution, the cadres of various agencies in Changsha held symposiums one after another. When the members of the Jiannongqiao Vegetable Cooperative in the suburbs of the city heard the provision in the draft constitution that "the state protects the property of cooperatives and encourages, guides, and helps the development of the cooperative economy," everyone happily talked about it. In the evening, many streets rang with bells, and street representatives shook the bells while shouting, notifying residents to go to the reading groups to listen to the important news in the newspaper that day.

    Guiyang City
    The draft constitution has been warmly supported and welcomed by people from all walks of life in Guiyang City. After hearing the news, the workers of Guiyang Power Plant automatically organized three groups to read and discuss the draft constitution. Worker Xiong Xianfeng said: "Last year, we elected people's representatives, and this year, the draft constitution was promulgated, and we were allowed to study and discuss it. I realized that I have become the master of my own house." Worker Nie Guangqiang said: "The draft constitution has further encouraged our confidence in building socialism. We must celebrate the promulgation of the draft constitution with new achievements in breaking through production quotas." Wang Yuqing, a female worker in the wrapping board workshop of Guizhou Bristle Factory, said: "When I read the draft constitution, I thought of the past. At that time, we women were discriminated against and had no rights at all. Today, the people's constitution stipulates that women enjoy equal rights with men. This fully shows that only in the new society can women truly be liberated. In the future, I must work hard to improve production together with the male workers." Model typist Comrade Luo Changfen, after reading the draft constitution, expressed her willingness to be loyal to the people's democratic system and to better help other comrades improve their work efficiency in her actual work in the future. The employees of Guizhou Nationalities College were also very happy after seeing the draft constitution. Long Yiyuan, a Buyi ethnic minority language researcher, felt that his work was an extremely important job when he read the articles on the development of ethnic minority languages in the draft constitution. He said that he was determined to do a good job and develop the language of his ethnic group in the future.

    各地人民热烈欢迎宪法草案
    南京市
    宪法草案公布的消息传到南京市后，人们争阅当天的报纸。这天邮局多售出新华日报八万多份。下关发电厂一个工人天没亮就赶到新街口买了五十份报纸，八十二岁的曹大爷也挟着拐杖到邮局购买了一份报纸。南京灯泡厂职工看到宪法草案以后，欢乐的情绪充满了各个车间。这个厂在解放初期只能生产一些普通灯泡，现在已能生产各种特种灯泡，劳动生产率逐年提高，职工生活也一天天上升了。
    南京市第七区机器拖拉机站拖拉机手高文海阅读着报纸，高兴地说：“宪法把人民斗争得来的胜利成果用法律固定下来，又指明了前进的道路，我们干起来就更有信心了。”他向跟他学习驾驶拖拉机的青年农民说：“我一定把我所知道的都教给你们，让你们不久也能成为拖拉机手。”
    从清晨到中午，南京市各高等学校的广播站不断播送着宪法草案的消息，南京市第一女子中学的教师、学生，在十四日晚上九点钟就写好了庆祝宪法草案的黑板报。南京农学院农学系的教授们看过报纸，也相互鼓励：一定要好好阅读和讨论宪法草案，将来更好地为培养祖国建设人才而努力。
    南京市各机关的干部看到宪法草案后，更感到自己责任的重大，有些同志还联系了自己的工作，保证今后改进工作，并且要做守法模范。市人民法院审判员崔凌说：“宪法草案上规定我们的责任这样重大，任务这样光荣，我们必须认真研究宪法草案，完成光荣任务。”

    福州市五十万人民以兴奋的心情迎接宪法草案。十五日清晨，全市三百多个扩音器分别以福州话、闽南话播送宪法草案的内容。福建日报出版后，到各邮局、邮亭买报的人络绎不绝。报纸发行的份数比往日增加了二万三千多份。福州修车厂机工车间主任詹长森看完报纸后说：“我在解放前当了二十五年的工人，一直受罪，解放后当上了车间主任。新社会让我们工人当家做主，今天宪法草案第一条，就肯定了我们工人阶级的领导权。”福州市郊凤湖乡农业生产合作社社长许章成把消息告诉全体社员后说：“只要看到今年社里长的好稻苗、村里装的抽水机、屋里摆的打谷机，比一比解放前后的生活，就能想到合作化道路的正确了。”
    正在准备考大学的福建师范学院附属工农速成中学一百多个毕业生特别激动。宗连魁说：新社会使我从一个原来只认得两百多字的半文盲变成高中毕业生。这次宪法草案又对公民受教育的权利作了明文的规定，这对我们青年学生是一个莫大的鼓舞。我一定要用实际行动来迎接新中国第一个宪法的诞生。
    杭州市
    杭州市人民一片欢腾，热烈欢迎中华人民共和国宪法草案。西湖畔的贴报栏前，从早到晚围着阅报的人。各工厂的黑板报上都用大字标题报道这个喜讯。国营浙江麻纺织厂的五、六十个工人组成的报喜队在厂里活跃着。国营杭州通用机器厂工人、劳动模范朱汉昌提出保证完成六月份生产任务来庆祝宪法草案的公布，得到全组工人的响应。正在风景美丽的西湖边中国邮电工会休养所休养的劳动模范和先进工作者们，从收音机里听到有关宪法草案的消息后，大家兴奋地谈论着这一件历史上从来没有过的大喜事，并仔细地读了报上公布的宪法草案，举行了小型漫谈会。福建省永安县五十多岁的老年邮电工人游建人说：过去我们工人不知道有什么休息，解放后，政府办了医院、疗养院、休养所，现在宪法草案中又明文规定了劳动者有从事劳动、享受休息，以及老年时获得物质帮助的权利。只有我们自己的政府、自己的宪法才能这样关怀我们。在上海电话公司做了三十多年工的线务工人王长林也说：现在我们有了医院，有了休假制度，还可以到风景美丽的西湖来休养，宪法草案又规定还要逐步扩充劳动者休息和休养的物质条件，这真是我们过去做梦也想不到的事。当消息传到正在进行夏茶生产的西湖附近龙井茶区，茶农们兴奋极了。狮峰互助组副组长王根达马上把宪法草案一条条向组员们宣读，大家都说：国家真处处为我们劳动人民打算啊！　（据新华社讯）
