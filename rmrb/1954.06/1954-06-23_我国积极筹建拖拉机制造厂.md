    China Actively Prepares to Build Tractor Factory

    (Xinhua News Agency, 22nd) Preparations for building China's first tractor factory are actively underway.

    The preparations for the construction of this factory began in July last year. The factory site has now been selected, and the data required for the preliminary design has been collected. Soviet experts assisting in the construction are preparing for the preliminary design based on this data. The staff preparing for the factory construction and a large number of surveying personnel have begun collecting technical design data. This year, the tractor factory will first build temporary power equipment, construct a dedicated railway line, and build some employee dormitories, preparing conditions in many ways for the official start of construction.

    At present, in the vast rural areas of our country, in addition to state-owned farms already using tractors and agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups having begun to use new-style horse-drawn farm implements, the vast majority of farmers are still using old-fashioned and backward production tools. After this tractor factory is completed and put into production, it will greatly promote the transformation of agricultural technology in our country and lay a material foundation for the realization of agricultural collectivization in our country.

    The Central People's Government and the people of the whole country are very concerned about the preparations for the construction of the tractor factory. Relevant agencies in various places are also actively helping to collect various factory construction data. Laboratory departments in Shanghai, Shenyang, Dalian, and other places have promptly tested various materials for this factory. The higher-level leading organs of the tractor factory and the local Chinese Communist Party organizations have also transferred a large number of cadres and technicians to participate in the preparation work.

    我国积极筹建拖拉机制造厂
    【新华社二十二日讯】我国第一个拖拉机制造厂的建厂筹备工作正在积极进行。
    这个工厂的筹建工作是去年七月间开始的。现在厂址已经选定，初步设计所需要的资料也已搜集好了，帮助建厂的苏联专家正根据这些资料准备进行初步设计。筹建这个工厂的工作人员和大批的勘察人员，已经开始了技术设计资料的搜集。今年拖拉机制造厂将先建设临时动力设备和修筑铁路专运线，并建筑一部分职工宿舍，从多方面来为正式动工兴建准备条件。
    目前我国的广大农村，除国营农场已使用拖拉机、农业生产合作社和互助组已经开始使用新式马拉农具外，绝大多数农民还使用着旧式的、落后的生产工具。这个拖拉机制造厂建成投入生产后，将大大促进我国农业技术的改造，为实现我国农业集体化奠定物质的基础。
    中央人民政府和全国人民都非常关心拖拉机制造厂的筹建。各地有关机关也积极帮助搜集各项建厂资料。上海、沈阳、旅大等地的化验部门，已及时为这个工厂化验了各种材料。拖拉机制造厂上级领导机关和当地中国共产党组织，并调集了大批干部和技术人员参加筹建工作。
