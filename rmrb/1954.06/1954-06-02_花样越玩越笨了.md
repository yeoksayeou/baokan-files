　　The Tricks Are Getting Clumsier and Clumsier
　　By Our Correspondents Wu Wentao and Li Zhuang
　　During the discussion of the six basic principles for a ceasefire in Indochina proposed by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, the ninth closed-door meeting held today focused on the issue of supervising the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.

　　This problem was not difficult to solve in the first place. If there is a willingness to cease hostilities, then there should be agreement to establish appropriate mechanisms to supervise the implementation of the ceasefire agreement at any time, so as to stabilize the ceasefire and truly restore peace in Indochina. However, certain parties, led by the United States, are simply unwilling to do so. Under the pressure of world public opinion, they dare not openly oppose the solemn principles proposed by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, and first cast "neither accept nor oppose" hidden reefs on issues such as a swift and comprehensive ceasefire and the assembly areas of both sides' armies, and then step by step carry out new obstructions on the issue of supervision, playing their old conspiracy with different tricks. Although the conspiracy remains the same, the tricks are getting clumsier and clumsier, making them obvious at a glance.

　　As everyone knows, two kinds of monitoring mechanisms for the cessation of hostilities in Indochina have already been proposed at the Indochina issue closed-door meetings. One is the mixed commission composed of both belligerent parties proposed by Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong at the second plenary session on May 10, namely the ceasefire commission; the other is the neutral nations supervisory commission proposed by Foreign Minister Molotov at the fourth plenary session on May 14. These two mechanisms complement each other and are effective means of supervising the implementation of the ceasefire. Since the belligerent parties are the main body of the ceasefire, as long as both sides are truly sincere about peace, even if violations of the agreement occur during the ceasefire process, it would not be difficult for the ceasefire commission composed of both sides to handle them through consultation; on the other hand, the supervisory commission composed of appropriate neutral nations is responsible for supervising violations of the ceasefire agreement within the territory and supervising the illegal entry of reinforcements and war materials from outside the territory. Cooperating with the military ceasefire commission, it can achieve the effect of monitoring and urging. If these two mechanisms can fully play their respective roles, coupled with the international guarantees of collective measures repeatedly proposed by Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China, then a consolidated peace in Indochina can be expected soon. Of course, any attempt to merge the mixed commission, which is the main body for implementing the ceasefire, with the neutral nations supervisory commission, thereby abolishing the mixed commission, or making it subordinate to the neutral nations supervisory commission, is unreasonable.

　　The U.S. delegation could not find any justifiable reason to oppose the establishment of a neutral nations commission to supervise the ceasefire in Indochina. Instead, they cited the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission as an example, insisting that this body had "failed" and that such a body was "worse than none at all." Anyone familiar with the progress of the Geneva Conference knows that the U.S. ruling clique had long laid many "ambushes" in order to oppose the formation of a neutral nations supervisory commission when discussing the issue of supervision, so as to prevent the realization of a ceasefire in Indochina. On May 17, the U.S. delegation in Geneva published a letter from the Swedish and Swiss members of the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to the Korean Military Armistice Commission on May 7, 1954, insisting that the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission was no longer able to perform the tasks assigned to it by the Korean Armistice Agreement. On May 29, the U.S. Department of Defense released several "documents" to distort the facts and slander the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission as "not 'neutral' with respect to their solemnly accepted mission responsibilities"...

　　But the facts immediately slapped them in the face. The correctness of the policy of organizing the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is obvious to all. For ten months, thanks to this mechanism, inspections were carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement in the rear ports of both North and South Korea and in other areas outside the demilitarized zone. Its contributions and achievements in assisting the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement cannot be distorted or erased by anyone. Of course, the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission encountered many difficulties in the course of its work, but these difficulties came entirely from the United Nations, namely the U.S. side. When forcibly detaining a large number of captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese sides, the United States had four times falsely accused the Korean and Chinese sides of detaining American prisoners of war, requesting the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to conduct investigations in order to divert the attention of world public opinion. Because these were baseless accusations, how could the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission investigate them? On the other hand, people remember that the United States constantly violated the Korean Armistice Agreement and illegally shipped in reinforcements and military supplies. As of the end of February this year, the war materials shipped into Korea by the United States in the name of spare parts, disassembled parts, and components alone could equip 1,365 machine guns, 465 cannons and howitzers of various calibers, 145 mortars, and 6,400 rocket launchers. These illegal activities of the United States were repeatedly exposed by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and as a result, the U.S. side even violently and repeatedly restricted the activities of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams at various ports in South Korea. In sharp contrast to the illegal activities of the U.S. side, the Korean and Chinese sides have always strictly abided by the Armistice Agreement and provided the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams with convenience in every possible way, enabling the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to smoothly carry out its tasks in North Korea. The experience of Korea, especially the experience of North Korea, proves that as long as both sides of the ceasefire are sincere in abiding by the Armistice Agreement, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission will be able to play a significant role. It is conceivable that if there were no Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea, the U.S. side's violations of the Armistice Agreement would be many times greater than they are now. For the United States, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission makes it feel hampered, which is the fundamental reason why it dislikes the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

　　According to the wishes of the U.S. ruling clique, it is best not to establish any neutral nations supervisory commission in Indochina, and it is best not to reach a ceasefire agreement at all; if it is to be established, it can only be the "supervisory" commission that it needs, that is, one that can act entirely according to its will. Therefore, Western newspapers revealed that at today's meeting, the U.S. representative put forward the absurd proposition that only "non-communist countries" can participate in the neutral nations supervisory commission. This is of course a unique "logic" of the U.S. ruling clique. If this "logic" is followed, then all "communist countries" are non-neutral countries, because communism is a social system; then, "non-communist countries" are also not neutral countries, because "non-communism" is also a social system. In this way, wouldn't there be no neutral countries in the world at all? Of course, the scope of authority, affiliation, and organizational form of the neutral nations supervisory commission can all be discussed, but it is common sense that the neutral nations supervisory commission should be composed of several appropriate non-belligerent countries, namely neutral countries. Any attempt to distort this is futile.

　　Anyone who pays attention to the activities carried out by the U.S. rulers outside the Geneva Conference will easily see that the United States is conspiring to use the United Nations to replace the neutral nations supervisory commission, imposing this organization, which has long been discredited in the Korean War, on the people of Indochina, in order to create new disputes at will. Not long ago, the Thai ambassador to the United States was summoned to Geneva to discuss with the Thai Foreign Minister and U.S. delegation leader Smith the issue of Thailand requesting the United Nations to send a "peace observation committee" to "observe" the area near the Indochina border. Subsequently, Thailand formally submitted a request to the United Nations to send a "peace observation committee." As the editorial of the "New York Herald Tribune" admitted: "The United States certainly wants a United Nations mandate before taking further action on Indochina." The "New York Times" also said in a Geneva dispatch: "If a ceasefire is reached in Vietnam, the United States will suggest that the permanent political solution be decided by the United Nations General Assembly," "It is understood that the United States will agree to the United Nations General Assembly appointing a five-nation supervisory commission." This dangerous conspiracy of the U.S. ruling clique has increasingly aroused the dissatisfaction of some Western European bourgeois newspapers. When talking about Thailand's request to the UN Security Council, the French "France Soir" said: "What is Dulles's plan? First, he attempts to raise the backdrop of the United Nations in order to put the 'defense' organization of Southeast Asia on it in case of success... If the United Nations observer group goes to the Far East, those delegations in Geneva can actually break up." The British "Observer" said: "This appeal (referring to Thailand's request to the Security Council) will be an attempt to militarily and diplomatically choose another inappropriate location to threaten the Chinese," "It is believed that bringing the United Nations in at this stage will only bring unnecessary trouble." It can be said with certainty that in the face of the Geneva Conference, people will still see and must overcome the endless destructive conspiracies of the United States, although these conspiracies are increasingly unable to deceive the people of all countries who resolutely demand peace in Indochina.　May 31

    花样越玩越笨了
    本报记者　吴文焘　李庄
    在讨论周恩来外长所提出的关于在印度支那停战的六点基本原则时，今天举行的第九次秘密会议的注意力集中到对停战协定实行监督的问题上。
    这个问题本来是不难解决的。如果愿意停止敌对行动，就应该同意设立适当的机构，随时监督停战协定执行的状况，以便把停战稳定下来，真正恢复印度支那的和平。但以美国为首的某些方面，却偏偏不愿意这样作。他们迫于世界舆论的压力，不敢公开反对周恩来外长建议的严正原则，而先在迅速全面停战、双方军队集结地区等问题上投下“既不接受也不反对”的暗礁，然后就步步为营地在监督问题上进行新的阻挠，玩弄其不同花样的老阴谋。虽然阴谋依旧，但花样是越玩越笨，使人一见便知了。
    大家知道，在印度支那问题秘密会议上已经提出了两种停止印度支那敌对行动的监察机构，一种是范文同代外长在五月十日第二次大会上提出的由交战双方组成的混合委员会，即停战委员会；一种是莫洛托夫外长在五月十四日第四次大会上提出的中立国监督委员会。这两种机构相辅而行，是监督停战实施的有效手段。由于交战双方是停战的主体，只要双方确有和平的诚意，在停战过程中即使发生违反协定的情事，自不难由双方组成的停战委员会协商处理；另一方面，由适当的中立国组成的监督委员会负有监督境内违反停战协定的行为和监督自境外违法运入增援部队和作战物资的责任，它和军事停战委员会相配合，即可收监察督促的效果。这两种机构如能充分发挥自己的作用，再加以越、苏、中一再提出的实行集体措施的国际保证，那么印度支那的巩固的和平是可以指日而待的。当然，任何企图使作为实施停战的主体的混合委员会与中立国监督委员会混而为一，从而取消混合委员会，或者使它从属于中立国监督委员会，都是不合情理的。
    美国代表团找不出任何可以站得住脚的理由，来反对成立监督印度支那停战的中立国委员会，竟举出朝鲜中立国监察委员会作例子，硬说这个机构是“失败”了，像这样的机构“有比没有还坏”。凡是熟悉日内瓦会议进展状况的人都晓得，美国统治集团为了在讨论监督问题的时候反对组成中立国监督委员会，以便不能在印度支那实现停战，老早埋下了许多“伏笔”。五月十七日，美国代表团在日内瓦发表了朝鲜中立国监察委员会瑞典、瑞士委员在一九五四年五月七日致朝鲜军事停战委员会的信，硬说朝鲜中立国监察委员会已无力执行朝鲜停战协定所赋予它的任务。五月二十九日，美国国防部又发表了几个“文件”，来颠倒黑白，诬蔑朝鲜中立国监察委员会波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员“对他们庄严地接受下来的使命责任并不是‘中立’的”……。
    但事实马上打了它们的嘴巴。组织朝鲜中立国监察委员会的方针的正确性是有目共睹的。十个月来，由于有了这个机构，才在南北朝鲜各后方口岸以及非军事以外的其他地区，按照停战协定的规定进行了监察。它对于协助实施朝鲜停战协定的贡献和成绩，任何人都不能歪曲和抹煞。当然，朝鲜中立国监察委员会在工作过程中曾经遇到过许多困难，但这种困难完全来自联合国即美国方面。美国在强迫扣留大批朝中被俘人员的时候，曾经四次诬控朝中方面扣留了美方的战俘，要求中立国监察委员会进行调查，以便转移世界舆论界的视线。因为这是莫须有的事情，中立国监察委员会怎能调查出来呢？另一方面，人们记得，美国不断违反朝鲜停战协定，非法运入增援军事物资，截至今年二月底，美国仅以散件、拆散件、零件的名义，运入朝鲜的作战物资就能装备一千三百六十五挺机枪、四百六十五门各种口径的炮和榴弹炮、一百四十五门迫击炮、六千四百门火箭炮。美国这些非法活动，一再被中立国监察委员会所揭发，因而美方竟至横暴地一再限制中立国视察小组在南朝鲜各口岸的活动。和美国方面的非法活动恰恰相反，朝中方面始终严格遵守停战协定，多方予中立国视察小组以便利，使中立国监察委员会在北朝鲜顺利地执行着它的任务。朝鲜的经验证明特别是北朝鲜的经验证明，只要停战双方具有遵守停战协定的诚意，中立国监察委员会必能发挥巨大的作用。可以设想，如果朝鲜没有中立国监察委员会，美国方面违反停战协定的事实不知要比现在多许多倍。对于美国说来，中立国监察委员会使它感到碍手碍脚，这就是它所以不喜欢中立国监察委员会的根本原因。
    按照美国统治集团的心愿，在印度支那最好不必设立什么中立国监督委员会，最好根本达不到停战协议；如果要设立的话，就只能设立它所需要的，即能完全照着它的意志行事的“监督”委员会。因此，西方报界透露：在今天的会议上，美国代表提出只有“非共产主义国家”才能参加中立国监督委员会的荒谬主张。这当然是美国统治集团特有的
  “逻辑”。如果根据这种“逻辑”推论下去，凡是
  “共产主义国家”都是非中立国，因为共产主义是
  一种社会制度；那么，“非共产主义国家”也就不是中立国了，因为“非共产主义”也是一种社会制度。这样，世界上岂不是根本没有中立国了么？当然，中立国监督委员会的职权范围、隶属关系和组织形式都是可以讨论的，但中立国监督委员会应由若干适当的没有参战的国家即中立国所组成，却是普通的常识问题，任何人妄图加以曲解都是徒劳无功的。
    凡是注意美国统治者们在日内瓦会议之外所进行的活动的人们，都不难看到美国正在阴谋搬用联合国来代替中立国监督委员会，把在朝鲜战争中早已威信扫地的这个组织强加在印度支那人民的头上，以便随心所欲地制造新的争端。不久以前，泰国驻美大使被召到日内瓦，和泰国外长与美国代表团团长史密斯商谈由泰国向联合国要求派遣“和平观察委员会”到靠近印度支那边境“观察”的问题。接着，泰国就正式向联合国提出派遣“和平观察委员会”的请求。正如“纽约先驱论坛报”的社论所承认的：“美国在对印度支那采取进一步行动之前，确实愿意有一张联合国的命令”。“纽约时报”在一篇日内瓦通讯中也说：“如果在越南达成停战的话，美国便将建议把永久性的政治解决交由联合国大会来决定”，“据了解，美国将同意由联合国大会指派一个五国监督委员会”。美国统治集团这种危险的阴谋行动，已日益引起某些西欧资产阶级报纸的不满。法国的“法兰西晚报”在谈到泰国向联合国安理会的要求时说：“杜勒斯的打算是什么呢？首先他企图打起联合国的布景，以便在成功的情况下放上东南亚的‘防御’组织……。如果联合国观察团去了远东，在日内瓦的那些代表团实际上只能散伙。”英国“观察家报”说：“这个呼吁（指泰国向安理会的请求）将是从军事上和外交上选择又一个不得当的地点来威胁中国人的企图”，
  “人们认为，在目前阶段把联合国拉进来，只能带来不必要的麻烦”。可以肯定地说，在日内瓦会议面前，人们还会看到和必须克服美国的层出不穷的破坏阴谋，虽然这些阴谋是日益骗不过坚决要求印度支那和平的各国人民了。　五月三十一日
