    Correctly Implementing the Newspaper and Magazine Subscription System
    ——Reader Letters and Commentary
    Li Ming
    Continuously improving newspaper and magazine distribution work, ensuring that newspapers and magazines are distributed to the people who truly need them, so as to fully exert the political role of newspapers and magazines and meet the demands of readers, is the urgent demand of the broad masses of people and also the glorious political task of the postal and telecommunications departments.
    Since the implementation of the unified postal distribution of newspapers and magazines in the spring of 1950, the postal and telecommunications departments have done a lot of work to improve the distribution of newspapers and magazines, established a distribution system led by the socialist postal and telecommunications departments, and created favorable conditions for expanding the circulation of newspapers and magazines through the nationwide postal communication network. In order to take care of the convenience of the broad masses of readers subscribing to newspapers and magazines, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications successively issued instructions from late May 1953, and stipulated at the Second National Distribution Work Conference held in November that newspapers should be subscribed to at least monthly and magazines at least quarterly, but subscribers with special circumstances or difficulties could subscribe to newspapers and magazines beyond the quarter or month, without necessarily ending at the end of the month or quarter. This decision is beneficial to facilitating readers and expanding the circulation of newspapers and magazines. However, judging from some of the readers' letters that the People's Daily has recently received successively, the postal and telecommunications departments in some areas have not seriously implemented this method, so readers still feel very inconvenient when subscribing to newspapers and magazines. According to a reader's letter from Shanxi, "Xiaohan Village Primary School in Qixian County, Shanxi Province, was formally established in March this year. At that time, the subscription period for the second quarter of newspapers had passed, and the comrades from the post office said that it would take three months before they could subscribe to the third quarter of newspapers. The teachers and students of the school have a lot of opinions on this unreasonable regulation of the local post office." The receiving and dispatching office of the Jingxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Anhui Province recently wrote, "The biggest difficulty we have in subscribing to newspapers is that the local post office cannot subscribe to newspapers at any time beyond the month and stop at any time. Because our organs often hold large meetings, and the mobility of cadres is also very high, sometimes there are more people in the organs and we want to subscribe to newspapers but cannot subscribe, which affects everyone's study; sometimes there are fewer people and we want to unsubscribe but cannot, which causes waste. For example, recently a group of cadres were transferred from the organs, and more than twenty days of newspapers were completely wasted." Huo Shoufan of the Zhaoyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Hubei Province and the receiving and dispatching office of the Licheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Shanxi Province also wrote to reflect similar situations. Wen Zaizhang, principal of Yuwangcheng Village Primary School in Xiaxian County, Shanxi, wrote: "The government allocates 210,000 yuan to our school every month. In addition to subscribing to the People's Daily, we also need to subscribe to several other necessary newspapers and magazines. If we subscribe monthly, it is still possible, but the comrades at the post office insist that we subscribe quarterly and pay one month in advance. For example, for our school's subscription fee for the second quarter of this year, the post office asked us to pay when we were still in vacation training. At that time, the school had not yet received the funds. If we subscribe, the subscription fee for various newspapers and magazines for three months would be 123,000 yuan at once; if we don't subscribe, we are afraid that we will miss the opportunity and affect everyone's study. Finally, although we took out a part of the money from the miscellaneous fees to pay, we still failed to subscribe to the People's Daily because of insufficient economic strength."
    The above facts show that the national distribution conference's provisions to facilitate readers have not been well communicated and deployed to lower-level postal and telecommunications departments, or even if they have been communicated and deployed, there has not been enough supervision and inspection of the implementation, so situations reflected in some readers' letters have occurred. When readers encounter special circumstances and subscribe to newspapers and magazines from local post offices beyond the month or quarter, the staff of the local post offices still do not know that the higher authorities have such regulations.
    What is hindering the smooth implementation of this provision to facilitate readers? First of all, some postal workers (including a considerable number of leading cadres) lack a correct understanding of the relationship between promoting planned distribution and regular subscription systems and providing as much convenience as possible to readers. For example, some people say: "If we want to plan distribution, we cannot subscribe beyond the month or quarter," "Since we subscribe beyond the month or quarter, we cannot achieve planned distribution." Therefore, in order to "plan distribution," they ignore the difficulties of readers subscribing to newspapers and magazines. Secondly, some postal workers (especially grass-roots postal workers) do not have a sufficient understanding of the political significance of doing a good job in newspaper and magazine distribution, and they have developed negative emotions after correcting the tendency of forced distribution, and lack a high degree of enthusiasm and a serious and responsible spirit in their work. For example, some post offices, in order to facilitate themselves and reduce trouble, often arbitrarily shorten the subscription date when subscribing to newspapers and magazines. Individual post offices even stipulate only one day a month as the subscription time. These have increased the difficulties for readers and caused many newspapers and magazines to lose many readers at once.
    It should be pointed out that the policy of planned distribution of newspapers and magazines is correct, and it is also necessary to implement a regular subscription system for planned distribution. However, it must be recognized that the implementation of a regular subscription system for newspapers and magazines is an arduous task of changing the subscription habits of the broad masses of readers, and a steady approach should be adopted to promote it in a planned and step-by-step manner; at the same time, it should also be recognized that this is a social reform work, and the distribution department must carry out extensive publicity and strive for the active support of the broad masses of readers in order to implement it smoothly. Second, the main purpose of promoting planned distribution and regular subscription systems is to better serve readers and better meet their requirements, so we must take care of the current economic conditions and actual situations of readers, and we cannot demand too much or stipulate too rigidly at once, which will cause confusion in the work and arouse dissatisfaction among the broad masses of readers. This requires postal and telecommunications departments at all levels to attach importance to the distribution of newspapers and magazines, and actively publicize planned distribution to readers, so that readers who already have the conditions for regular subscription can consciously implement the subscription methods stipulated by the postal and telecommunications departments, so as to strengthen the planning of newspaper and magazine publishing and distribution work; at the same time, for readers who have difficulties in implementing the regular subscription system, whether they are organs, organizations, or individuals, necessary care must be given according to the actual situation. The Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has issued an announcement for this purpose, and postal and telecommunications departments at all levels should resolutely implement the various provisions in the announcement, and the broad masses of readers should also give enthusiastic support and supervision. Only in this way can the broad masses of readers be able to conveniently subscribe to the newspapers and magazines they need, and the planned distribution of newspapers and magazines can be gradually promoted.

    正确地推行报刊预订制度
    ——读者来信述评
    李明
    不断地改进报刊发行工作，使报纸杂志发行到真正需要它的人民手中，以充分发挥报刊的政治作用，满足读者的要求，这是广大人民群众的迫切要求，也是邮电部门光荣的政治任务。
    自一九五○年春实行报刊邮发合一以来，邮电部门对改进报刊发行工作曾作了很多的工作，确立了以社会主义性质的邮电部门为领导的发行系统，而且通过遍及全国的邮政通信网为扩大报刊发行面创造了有利的条件。为了照顾广大读者订阅报刊的方便，邮电部在一九五三年五月下旬起曾连续发出指示，并在十一月召开的第二次全国发行工作会议上规定了报纸最低按月、杂志最低按季，但对有特殊情况或困难的订户可破季破月订阅报刊，不一定月底季底截止等办法。这个决定，对便利读者、扩大报刊的发行是有好处的。但是，从人民日报最近陆续收到的一些读者来信看，有些地区的邮电部门并没有认真执行这个办法，因此使读者订阅报刊时仍然感到很不方便。据山西一读者来信说：“山西省祁县小韩村小学在今年三月间正式成立，当时第二季度报纸的收订期已经过了，邮局同志说要等三个月以后才能订到第三季度的报纸。该校师生们对当地邮局这种不合理的规定很有意见。”中共安徽省泾县委员会收发室最近来信说：“我们在订阅报纸中的最大困难是当地邮局不能破月随时订报和随时截止。因为我们的机关经常开大会，干部的流动性也很大，有时机关里人多了，要订报但订不到，影响了大家的学习；有时人少了要退又退不掉，造成了浪费。如最近因为机关里调走了一批干部，有二十几天的报纸就全部浪费了。”中共湖北省枣阳县委员会霍守藩和中共山西省黎城县委员会收发室也都来信反映了类似情况。山西夏县禹王城村小学校长文在章来信：“政府发给我校的经费每月为二十一万元，我们除了要订人民日报外，还要订阅其它几种必需的报刊，如果按月订还可以，但邮局同志一定要我们按季度订报，而且要提前一个月缴款。如我校今年第二季度的订报费，当我们还在假期集训时，邮局就要我们缴款了。当时学校还没有领下经费，如订吧，各种报刊三个月的订费一下子就是十二万三千多元；不订吧，又怕会错过时机，影响了大家的学习。最后虽然从学杂费中抽出一部分钱来支付了，可是因为经济力量不足，人民日报还是没有订成。”
    以上事实说明，全国发行会议这一便利读者的规定还没有很好地向下级邮电部门进行传达和布置，或者虽然传达、布置了，但对执行的情况督促检查不够，因此发生了像有些读者来信中所反映的情况，当读者遇到特殊情况向当地邮局破月破季订阅报纸杂志时，当地邮局的工作人员还不知道上级有这样的规定。
    是什么阻碍着这一方便读者的规定未能顺利贯彻呢？首先，某些邮政工作者（包括相当一部分的领导干部）对推行计划发行和定期预订制度与尽可能地给读者方便这两者之间的关系还缺乏正确的理解，如有些人说：“既要计划发行就不能破月破季订报”，“既然破月破季订报就不能做到计划发行”。因此，为了“计划发行”就不顾读者订阅报刊的困难了。其次，某些邮政工作人员（特别是基层邮政工作者）对作好报刊发行工作的政治意义认识不足，以及在纠正强迫摊派偏向后产生了消极情绪，工作中缺乏高度的积极性和认真负责精神。如有些邮局为了自己方便，减少麻烦，在收订报刊时往往随便缩短收订日期，个别邮局甚至在一月之内仅仅规定一天为收订时间。这些，都使读者增加了困难，并使不少报纸杂志一下子失去了很多的读者。
    应该指出：报刊计划发行的方针是正确的，为了计划发行而推行定期预订制度也是必要的。但是必须认识，推行报刊定期预订制度，是变更广大读者订报习惯的一个艰巨的工作，应该采取稳步的方针，有计划有步骤地来推行；同时也应认识这是个社会性的改革工作，发行部门必须进行广泛的宣传，争取广大读者的积极支持，才能顺利地实行。第二、推行计划发行和定期预订制度的主要目的就是为了使出版发行工作更好地为读者服务，更好地满足读者的要求，因此必须照顾读者目前经济条件和实际情况，不能一下要求过高、规定过死，而造成工作上的混乱，引起广大读者的不满。这就要求各级邮电部门重视报刊发行工作，并积极向读者进行计划发行的宣传工作，使已具备定期预订条件的读者自觉地执行邮电部门规定的订阅办法，以加强报刊出版发行工作的计划性；同时，对执行定期预订制度有困难的读者，无论是机关、团体或个人，必须根据实际情况予以必要的照顾，中央邮电部已为此发布了公告，各级邮电部门应坚决贯彻公告中的各项规定，广大读者亦应予以热烈支持和监督。只有这样，才能使广大读者能够方便地订到他们所需要的报刊，而报刊计划发行工作也才能逐步地推行。
