The British delegation's Marquis of Reading visited Soviet delegation's chief representative, Foreign Minister Molotov, on the morning of June 7th, explaining that because the sixteen-nation delegation was still awaiting instructions from their respective governments regarding the five basic principles agreement for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue proposed by Foreign Minister Molotov at the June 5th meeting, they requested a postponement of this restricted conference. The delegations of the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have agreed to this.

    苏中朝代表团同意英国代表的要求
    朝鲜问题限制性会议延期
    【新华社日内瓦七日电】原来协定在六月七日举行的关于朝鲜问题的限制性会议，今天未能举行。英国代表团的里丁侯爵七日上午访问苏联代表团首席代表莫洛托夫外长，说明因为十六国代表团对莫洛托夫外长在六月五日会议上提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的五项基本原则协议，尚须等待他们本国政府的指示，故要求延期举行此项限制性会议。苏联、中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表团已予同意。
