The exhibits included over 1,000 pieces of work from all kindergarten, elementary, and junior high school children in the city, displayed in six indoor areas: literature and art, models, natural science, agricultural tool specimens, crafts, and aviation models.

    In the literature and art room, there were children's paintings, designs, paper cuttings, poems, short essays, and other works.

The crafts room featured various exquisite plaster statues and crafts made of bamboo, mud, wood, and cloth, such as furniture, toys, and handkerchiefs. The embroidery "The Motherland is Under Construction," collectively created by the interest group of Baijingfang Lane Elementary School, is an exquisite and beautiful piece. The natural science room and aviation model room displayed various scientific instruments and airplane models. There were gliders and models of various world-famous airplanes. Even more fascinating was the electric small train made by the children of Qinghua Middle School, which would automatically run on the tracks with the flick of a switch.

    杭州举办少年儿童创作展览
    杭州市在五月二十九日举办了少年儿童创作展览。展览品包括全市幼儿班、小学和初中的全体少年儿童的作品共一千多件，分别在文艺、模型、自然科学、农具标本、工艺、航空模型等六个室内陈列。
    在文艺室里，有儿童的创作画、图案、剪纸、诗歌、短文等作品。杭州市第二中学三年级学生宋鼎华的水彩画——“毛主席喜欢我们”，画出毛主席和蔼地和孩子们一道站在西湖畔，表现出儿童们丰富的想像力和热爱自己领袖的心情。工艺室里有着各种精巧的石膏像和竹、泥、木、布做的各种家具、玩具、手帕等工艺品。百井坊巷小学兴趣小组集体创作的刺绣——“祖国在建设”，是一幅精巧的优美的作品。自然科学室和航空模型室里陈列有各种科学仪器、飞机模型。这里有滑翔机，有世界上著名的各种飞机模型。更使人感到新奇的是清华中学少年儿童们制造的电动小火车，只要一开电钮，火车就自动行驶在铁轨上了。　（据新华社讯）
