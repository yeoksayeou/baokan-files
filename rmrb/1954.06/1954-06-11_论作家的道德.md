On the Morality of Writers
Soviet Union Fyodor Gladkov

Editor's Note: The Soviet "Pravda" reported on May 6th: At the meeting of the Presidium of the Soviet Writers Association Council on April 28, 1954, it was unanimously agreed to expel A. Surov, N. Virta, Z. Gersanov, and R. Korobov from the ranks of the Writers Association because their many immoral and anti-social behaviors were incompatible with the title of Soviet writer. The Presidium of the Council emphasized that no noble title and no merit can justify a literary figure's anti-social or immoral behavior. This resolution of the Soviet Writers Association should be valued by our country's literary and art circles. Gladkov's essay "On the Morality of Writers" discusses the noble qualities and social roles of old Russia's literary giants and the Soviet Union's outstanding writers, criticizes the bad behaviors of certain Soviet writers who violated national laws and socialist morality, and points out that the life and behavior of the "engineers of human souls" must become a model for everyone to learn from. This is also of great educational significance for our country's writers.

In no country in the world has literature played as great a social role as in Russia, and writers have never enjoyed such respect and love from the entire people as in Russia. Chernyshevsky called literature the "textbook of life" – and literature has indeed fulfilled this lofty social responsibility. It is reasonable to regard writers as teachers of life, writers are true "rulers of thought." One can recall the passionate Herzen, the angry exposers and rebels Lermontov and Griboyedov, the singers of people's struggle Nekrasov, Leo Tolstoy, Uspensky, and Korolenko, and one can recall Belinsky and Dobrolyubov. For them, literature was social service and the content of their entire lives. Their writings educated an entire generation, and their lives became models. The ideological and moral growth of Russian Marxists was directly influenced by the great Russian literature. Russian Marxists studied the works of Shchedrin, Chernyshevsky, G. Uspensky, Korolenko, Chekhov, and Mamin-Sibiryak, which exposed the deepest layers of Russian reality. Our great writers, as great idealists, had a sense of responsibility to the people, and they were people of high morality. As examples of lofty moral strength, their moral purity and high principles influenced the advanced sections of society. These writers were leaders, disseminators of truth, and warriors for justice; people followed them, imitated them, fought against vices and vestiges, and eliminated all kinds of vulgar and corrupt behaviors.

Of course, in addition to these morally noble people, there were also some literary figures who were far from the people and detached from social movements. These idlers, parasites, vulgar individualists, and anarchist nihilists were empty in their souls. They poisoned themselves with alcoholism, licentiousness, quarrels, and beatings; anarchists and various political bandits recruited them as their pawns. Such literary figures lived a disgraceful life and would not have any achievements to enrich our motherland's literature.

The Soviet people who are building communism should make their lives and their private behaviors conform to the great goals of our motherland. Soviet citizens, especially Soviet writers, cannot have a so-called second private life that is detached from socialist public life. The working people of the world watch Soviet writers with love and respect, just like they watch creators, entrepreneurs, and representatives of the new socialist society.

Today, licentiousness and hooliganism seem to be non-existent. These things are incompatible and hostile to our socialist reality. But vices and vestiges still exist, and we must fight against them. We are ashamed that even among writers we still have to conduct this kind of struggle.

I believe that alcoholism is one of the most terrible and harmful vices. This infectious disease not only strikes those who are not firm, but can also sometimes strike those who seem to have undergone strict training. I am not referring to those banquets held for some celebration or friendly gathering. This is a matter of course, and there is nothing to criticize. I am referring to frequent alcoholism, which is an addiction to the shameful habit of poisoning oneself with narcotics that turns people into alcoholics.

Why does the hooliganism of alcoholism sometimes not meet with resistance among our writers? The unscrupulous drinking behavior of the playwright Surov turned into a series of social scandals. Once, he even committed the atrocity of slapping someone in the face at a writer's home. Surov's story has spread far beyond the literary and art circles. He behaved recklessly in the "House of Literature" and elsewhere, just like the old-time merchants and drunken brawlers in taverns. The scandals of his drinking in taverns and his and his driver's drinking finally aroused the indignant public opinion of the writers. The Secretariat of the Soviet Writers Association and the Party Committee had to consider whether Surov was still worthy of being called a member of the Party and a member of the writers' organization.

What makes people angry is not only the alcoholism itself, but also the fact that he does not feel ashamed of appearing in front of his comrades in this indecent manner, and these comrades treat him with an incomprehensible tolerance. They always try to gloss over the facts and, as they generally say, smooth things over. But you must know that it is impossible to hide scandals and drunken rampages: these reckless behaviors will damage the respect for the noble title of writer. People will sarcastically say:

	"Look, that's what writers are like! ... Look, that's the engineer of human souls! ..."

I have encountered a famous novelist with a pale face more than once. This writer provocatively answered my question of whether he was sick:

	"I'm drinking a lot of vodka!"

Horrible news about him is circulating among writers, but I don't know why no one feels the need to interfere with his behavior. Just recently, this writer attended a grand meeting drunk and caused astonishment there.

Everywhere on the street there are small restaurants, beer and soda (that is, vodka) shops, which drinkers aptly call taverns. In these taverns, you can also meet some writers who are drinking.

Of course, some historical, respected, and talented literary figures were also fond of alcohol and often drank heavily. But, in that era, many people were poor and persecuted. They often poisoned themselves with alcohol because of poverty, despair, and tragic fate. But we should not judge current writers based on them. I say again, in the past many of our writers were principled, incorruptible mouthpieces of the people. When Nekrasov praised such mouthpieces, he excitedly talked about its modesty and inspiring power:

	You never thought your value equaled a crown!
	Your wisdom burns incessantly.

Socialist literature has undergone various tests. Even in the most serious years when a group of drunken impressionist writers, futurist artists, and various self-righteous people ran amok, some talented artists and poets emerged from the people, and they used their healthy and combative creations to resist the hooliganistic anti-moralism. They created true socialist literature and helped the Party and the people build a new and beautiful life. These writers were initially few in number, but they had a revolutionary and Party spirit, so they were powerful, they carried out tireless struggles against harmful influences, and they laid a solid foundation for Soviet art. They inherited the traditions of noble communist morality. In the process of the cultural revolution, they used their artistic creations to cultivate new people – new creators, new young talented writers, and they themselves were educated and became staunch warriors and entrepreneurs.

Many Soviet writers are the best examples of selfless labor for the happiness of the people: it is enough to cite the great proletarian writer Gorky, recall Furmanov and A. Makarenko, Serafimovich and Ostrovsky, and respectfully point out the many writers we enjoy today who are loved by the people.

Our country has created a new, socialist literature, and the main activists of the era – workers and Communist Party members, future conquerors and creators of new and vibrant beauty – have become characters in literature. The Party and the government are concerned about educating writers and have created all the conditions for raising and prospering our literature. Soviet writers have their own responsibilities in the ranks of the warriors for a new life – during the first few Five-Year Plans, on the battle lines of the Great Patriotic War, and in the post-war construction years, whether in the past or now, they have actively served the motherland.

But, can bad people and embezzlers like A. Voloshin, the author of the novel "Kuznetsk Land," and Gersanov, the former chairman of the Buryat-Mongol Writers Association Council, have anything in common with Soviet literature and the combat ideology of our writers? Voloshin is a writer who has been overwhelmed by the success of some of his works. He drank, made trouble, and behaved like a hooligan in public places, and changed four wives in a short period of time. Being taken to the Public Security Bureau had become commonplace for him. He received a serious warning from the Party and was later expelled from the Party. And that Gersanov did not honestly do the work of the Buryat-Mongol Writers Association, but stole social property and put forty-two thousand rubles in his own pocket. What kind of behavior is this? The comrades of the Buryat-Mongol Writers Association did not hold him criminally responsible, but only "slightly blamed" him and advised him to atone for his sins with "tenacious creative labor"!

Obviously, treating writers like Surov, Gersanov, or Voloshin with tolerance is to exempt themselves and them from social condemnation. Some people even sympathize with alcoholics:

	"Poor man, he's relapsed! ..."

This method of treating licentious and arrogant literary figures is a corrupt method. The law and socialist morality must be observed by all people, whether they are ordinary people or big figures. The greater a writer's talent, the greater his responsibility for his behavior should be, and he should be a more noble example. But the leaders of the Writers Association are indulging and whitewashing the immoral and vulgar things and behaviors of certain writers. And they simply didn't pay attention to alcoholism ...

This reminds me of an incident: a drunk broke into the children's car of a train and began to make a drunken scene and say some obscene words. People were very angry with the drunk and protested, but the train attendant persuaded the passengers:

	"Well, citizens, what are you shouting about! A drunk ... Don't you make mistakes? You know, you drink too ..."

In my opinion, we should have organized public opinion against those who violate socialist morality long ago, and instead of indulging, we should formulate many practical measures to fight against alcoholism and reckless behavior, because everything that is forgiven today will encourage further drunken rampages tomorrow.

The glory of Soviet writers as spokespersons for the people should be elevated to the highest degree, and the behavior of writers should be an example for all people. The responsibilities of writers in the Soviet country are great, and they should constantly examine themselves and strive to live up to their titles.

In our country of creative labor, what infinite happiness and what great glory it is to be a writer and poet! In our country, there is no longer any phenomenon of people exploiting people – this is in a country that brings peace to the world and demonstrates against all dark and bloody forces. But why do some despicable, selfish, and nouveau riche figures always appear in our ranks (they use the trust of our youth to get rich for themselves)? It is enough to point out N. Virta, about Virta's behavior and way of life, "Komsomolskaya Pravda" has already talked about it. [Note]

I think these ugly remnants have become boils on some people, like goiters, which the people who have them cannot see themselves. The reason they can't see them is that some people in the healthy ranks of Soviet writers are separated from the masses of the people, live in seclusion in their homes, they don't care about the interests of workers and collective farmers, our country's great achievements don't interest them, they don't associate with the masses of the people, and they forget their responsibilities to the people.

	An urgent question arises. How do these people live? What is in their souls? What kind of ideals do they write for? What have they taught people, discovered, and proposed? You can usually find everything that the times and the environment require in their books and dramas. But their kind words and verbal enthusiasm are not their spiritual essence, not their soul and heart. On the contrary, their behavior and way of life are completely different.

The writer's creation is his personal expression, is his moral essence, is his connection with the working people. You must know that the teacher should be a model worthy of emulation by all students, and the "students" of Soviet writers are our outstanding Soviet people! But literary figures like Surov and Voloshin have vulgarized and tainted the great and noble title of writer, and they have had a bad influence on our honest, impeccable, and loyal literary figures, of which there are many, and the people trust them. No, Soviet writers cannot be judged according to these licentious prodigals and new "masters" with bourgeois vices. These are not people in our literary and art ranks, they are not worthy of the title of Soviet writer. If they exist in our literary and art circles, they will bring great harm: they will infect those who are not firm, hinder the education of young writers, make them develop bad habits of licentiousness, and thus hinder them from actively participating in communist construction. Their boasting, pride, and disrespect for comrades are the legacy of the despicable petty bourgeoisie. This is the characteristic that tarnishes the personality of Soviet literary figures.

The Writers Association and Party organizations should seriously launch public opinion against petty-bourgeois egoism, laxity, alcoholism, and rogue behavior, and wage a ruthless struggle against these vices. Forgiveness and indulgence of these people is political short-sightedness. Inappropriate leniency will hinder those who are negatively influenced from getting on the right path. Strict measures should be taken in a timely manner to make all kinds of scandals and immoral behaviors that are incompatible with our public life unthinkable in our lives.

    论作家的道德
    苏联  菲陀尔·革拉特珂夫
    编者按：苏联“真理报”五月六日报道：苏联作家协会理事会主席团在一九五四年四月二十八日的会议上，一致同意从作家协会的队伍中开除阿·苏洛夫、恩·维尔塔、采·盖尔萨诺夫和拉·科罗包夫，因为他们的许多不道德的和反社会的行为与苏联作家的称号不相容。理事会主席团强调说：任何高贵的称号和任何的功绩都不能为文学家的反社会或不道德的行为来辩护。苏联作家协会这一决议，应受到我国文艺界的重视。革拉特珂夫的关于这件事所写的论文“论作家的道德”，论述了旧俄的文学巨匠和苏联的优秀作家的高尚品质和社会作用，批判了苏联某些作家的违反国家法律和社会主义道德的恶劣行为，指出了“人类灵魂的工程师”的生活、行为必须成为大家学习的榜样。这对于我国作家们也有很大的教育意义。
    在世界上无论那一个国家里，文学从没有起过像在俄国那样伟大的社会作用，作家也不曾享有过像在俄国那样的尊重和全人民的热爱。车尔尼雪夫斯基把文学称为“生活的教科书”——文学也确实完成了这种崇高的社会职责。把作家看作生活的教师，这是有道理的，作家是真正的“思想统治者”。可以回忆一下热情的赫尔岑，愤怒的揭露者和反抗者莱蒙托夫和格里包耶多夫，人民斗争的歌手涅克拉索夫、列夫·托尔斯泰、乌斯宾斯基和柯罗连科，可以回忆一下别林斯基和杜勃罗留波夫。对于他们来说，文学就是社会服务，是他们的全部生活的内容。他们的著作使整个一代人受到了教育，他们的一生成为楷模。俄国的马克思主义者在思想和道德上的成长，是直接受到伟大的俄国文学的影响的。俄国的马克思主义者都学习过谢德林、车尔尼雪夫斯基、格·乌斯宾斯基、柯罗连科、契诃夫、马敏—希比凉克的作品，这些作品揭露出俄国现实生活的最里层。作为伟大理想家的我们的大作家，是具有对人民的责任感的，他们是具有高尚道德的人。作为崇高的、道德力量的榜样，他们的道德上的纯洁性、高度的原则性影响了社会的先进部分。这些作家是领导者、真理的传播者、拥护正义的战士；人们追随他们，摹仿他们，与恶习和遗毒进行斗争，消除各种庸俗的败行。
    当然，除了这些道德高尚的人以外，也有一部分远离人民和脱离社会运动的文学家。这些游手好闲的人、寄生虫、庸俗的个人主义者和无政府主义的虚无主义者们，在他们的灵魂里是空空如也的。他们用酗酒、淫荡、争吵和殴打来毒害自己；无政府主义者和各种政治匪徒把他们招募为自己的走卒。这种文学家过着一种耻辱的生活，是不会有什么成就来丰富我们祖国的文学的。
    建设共产主义的苏联人民，应当使自己的生活、自己的私人行为符合于我们祖国的伟大目标。苏联公民，特别是苏联作家，是不可能有脱离社会主义公共生活的所谓第二种私人的生活的。全世界的劳动人民怀着热爱和尊敬的心情注视着苏联作家，就像注视着创造者、事业家和新的社会主义社会的代表一样。
    在今天，放荡不羁的人和流氓习气，看起来似乎已经不能存在。这些东西对于我们社会主义的实际情况是格格不入、敌对的。但是恶习和遗毒还存在着，我们必须与它们进行斗争。我们引以为耻的，就是至今甚至在作家之间也要进行这种斗争。
    我认为酗酒是一种最可怕的和最有害的恶习之一。这种传染病不仅打中那种不坚定的人，时而也能打中那些好像是经过严格锻炼的人。我所谈的并不是指那些为了某个庆祝日或友好的联欢而举办的联欢宴会。这是理所当然的事，没有什么可责难的。我所指的是经常的酗酒，这种酗酒就是迷恋那种会把人变成酒鬼的毒害自己的麻醉剂的可耻的嗜好。
    为什么酗酒的流氓行为在我们作家之间有时遇不到反击呢？剧作家苏洛夫的肆无忌惮的酗酒行为变成了一连串的社会丑事。他有一次在一个作家的家里竟干出了打别人耳光的暴行。苏洛夫的故事已经远远传出了文艺界的范围。他无论在“文学之家”和其他地方都是胡作非为，就跟旧日的豪商和酒店里醉汉的胡闹一样。在酒肆里的酗酒、他和他的汽车司机的酗酒的丑事，终于引起了作家方面愤慨的舆论。苏联作家协会书记处和党委会不得不考虑：苏洛夫是不是还配称为党员和作家组织中的一员。
    使人愤怒的不仅是酗酒这件事的本身，还有，他居然并不以这种不体面的样子出现在同志们面前为可耻，而这些同志对待他的态度是以一种令人难解的宽容。他们总是尽力抹煞事实，就像一般所说的，把事情缓和下来。但是要知道，想把丑事和闹酒疯隐瞒起来，是不可能的：这些胡闹行为会损害对作家这一高贵称号的尊敬。人们会冷讽热嘲地说：
      “呶，作家就是这样啊！……呶，这就是人类灵魂的工程师啊！……”
    我不止一次地碰见一位著名的小说家面色发青。这位作家挑衅地回答了我问他是不是病了的问题：
      “我是在大喝其白酒啊！”
    作家当中流传着关于他的骇人听闻的新闻，但是不知道为什么不觉得需要去干涉他的这种行为。就是这位作家，不久以前还醉得不成样子地出席了一个隆重的会议，而且在那里引起了人们的惊讶。
    在大街到处都有小饭铺、啤酒和汽水（就是白酒）店，酒徒们把它们恰当地称为酒馆。在这些小酒馆里也可以遇到酗酒的一些作家。
    当然，有些历史上的、受人尊重的有天才的文学家也是好酒的，而且时常饮得酩酊大醉。但是，在那个时代，许多人是贫困的、受迫害的。他们时常由于贫困、绝望和悲惨的命运，而用酒精来毒害自己。但是我们不要根据他们来判断现在的作家。我再说一遍，过去我们许多作家都是有原则的、收买不了的人民喉舌。涅克拉索夫颂扬这样的喉舌时，曾激动地谈到它的谦逊和鼓舞的力量：
      你并没有想过你的价值等于王冠！
      你的智慧在不熄地燃烧着。
    社会主义的文学曾经受过各种考验。甚至当一群酗酒的印象派作家、未来派艺术家和各种自以为是的人到处横行无忌的最严重的年代里，从人民之中也出现了一些天才的艺术家和诗人，他们用自己的健康的、战斗的创作来对抗流氓性的反道德论。他们创造了真正的社会主义的文学，帮助了党和人民建设了新的美好的生活。这种作家最初是不多的，但是他们有着革命的、党的精神，因而他们是有力的，他们对有害的影响进行了不倦的斗争，并奠定了苏联艺术的牢固基石。他们继承了高贵的共产主义道德的传统。他们在文化革命的进程中，用自己的艺术创作培育了新人——新创造者，新的年轻的天才作家，自己也受到了教育，成为坚定不移的战士和事业家。
    许多苏联作家是为人民幸福而忘我劳动的最好榜样：只须举出伟大的无产阶级作家高尔基，回想一下富尔曼诺夫和阿·马卡伦科、绥拉菲莫维支和奥斯特洛夫斯基，并崇敬地指出我们今天享有人民热爱的许多作家，就足够了。
    我国创造了新的、社会主义的文学，时代的主要活动家——工人和共产党员、未来的征服者和新的、富有生命力的美的创造者——成为了文学中的人物。党和政府关切地教育作家，创造了提高和繁荣我们文学的一切条件。苏联的作家在争取新生活的战士队伍中是有自己的职责的——在前几个五年计划期间，在伟大卫国战争的战线上，在战后建设年代里，无论过去或现在，他们都是积极为祖国服务的。
    但是，像小说“库斯尼兹克地方”的作者，阿·沃罗申和布略特—蒙古作家协会理事会前任主席盖尔萨诺夫这样的坏人、侵盗公款者，难道和苏联文学、和我们作家的战斗的思想生活有共同之处吗？沃罗申是一位因他的作品的某些成功而冲昏了头脑的作家。他在公共场所里酗酒，胡闹，耍流氓，在很短时期内更换了四个妻子。被带到公安分局去已成为他的家常便饭。他受到了党的严重警告，后来被开除了党籍。而那位盖尔萨诺夫不是诚实地做布略特—蒙古作家协会的工作，却偷窃了社会财产，把四万二千个卢布装进自己的腰包。这是一种什么行为呢？布略特—蒙古作家协会的同志们没有使他负刑事责任，而只是“稍微责备了”他一下，并劝他用“顽强的创作劳动”来赎罪！
    显然，以宽容的态度对待像苏洛夫、盖尔萨诺夫或沃罗申这样的作家，就是为了使自己和他们免受社会的谴责。甚至于有人同情酗酒的人：
      “可怜的人，又犯老毛病了！……”
    这种对待放荡不羁和自高自大的文学家的方法，是腐朽的方法。法律和社会主义的道德是所有的人都要遵守的，无论他是普通人或大人物。作家的才能愈大，他对自己的行为的责任也应该愈大，他更应当是高尚的表率。但是作家协会的领导却在放纵和粉饰某些作家的不道德的和下流的事情和行为。而且对于酗酒的行为简直就没有去注意……
    这使我想起这样一件事：有一个醉汉闯进了列车的儿童车厢并开始大闹酒疯和说了一些猥亵的话。人们对这一醉鬼非常愤恨，提出了抗议，但是列车乘务员却劝乘客们说：
      “呶，公民们，有什么可嚷嚷的！一个喝醉了的人……你们就不犯错误吗？要知道，你们自己也是喝酒的……”
    据我看来，早就应当组织反对破坏社会主义道德的社会舆论，不要纵容，而要制订许多实际措施来与酗酒、胡作非为进行斗争，因为今天所饶恕的一切，明天就会鼓励进一步酗酒的胡闹行为。
    作为人民代言人的苏联作家的光荣，应当提高到最高度，作家的行为应成为所有的人的范例。苏维埃国家的作家的责任是重大的，要经常地检查自己和尽力作到不辜负自己的称号。
    在我们进行创造性劳动的国家里，做一个作家、诗人，是有怎样无限的幸福和多么伟大的光荣呀！在我国早已没有人剥削人的现象——这是在一个把和平带给全世界并对一切黑暗势力和血腥势力示威的国家里。但是为什么在我们队伍里总是出现一些为人所不齿的可耻人物、自私自利的人和暴发户呢
  （他们为了自己发财而利用着我们青年的信任）？只要指出恩·维尔塔就足够了，关于维尔塔的行为和生活方式，“共青团真理报”上已谈过了。〔注〕
    我认为，这些丑恶的残余成为了某些人的脓疱，就像是甲状腺肿一样，患这种病的人本人是看不见的。他们之所以看不出来，就是因为在苏联作家的健康的队伍中有些人脱离了人民大众，闭居在自己的住宅里，他们不关心工人和集体农民的利益，我们国家的伟大的成就使他们感不到兴趣，他们不和人民大众来往，忘记了自己对人民应负的责任。
      一个迫切的问题发生了。这些人靠什么为生呢？他们的灵魂里有些什么呢？他们写作品是为了一种什么样的理想呢？他们教给了人们一些什么，发现和提出了什么呢？你在他们的书籍和戏剧中通常可以找到时代和环境所要求的一切。但是他们的善意的话和口头上的热情，并不是他们的精神本质，不是他们的灵魂和心。相反地，他们的行为和生活方式却完全是另一种样子。
    作家的创作，就是他个人的表现，就是他的道德本质，就是他与劳动人民的联系。要知道，教师应当是值得所有学生仿效的范例，而苏联作家的“学生”就是我们的优秀的苏联人！但是像苏洛夫、沃罗申这样的文学家，却把伟大而高贵的作家称号庸俗化了并玷污了它，他们使我们那些正直的、无可责难的、忠实于党和人民的文学家受到了不好的影响，这样的文学家为数很多，而且人民是信任他们的。不，不能按照这些放荡不羁的浪子和具有资产阶级恶习的新的“老爷”来判断苏联作家。这不是我们文艺队伍里的人，他们不配有苏联作家这个称号。如果他们存在于我们文艺界，就会带来很大的损害：他们使不坚定的人受到薰染，妨害青年作家的教育，使他们养成放荡不羁的坏习惯，也就阻碍他们积极参加共产主义建设。他们的自夸、骄傲、对同志们不尊重是卑鄙的小市民的遗产。这就是玷污苏联文学家的人格的特点。
    作家协会和党组织应当认真地掀起社会舆论来反对小资产阶级的利己主义、散漫性、酗酒、无赖行为，并与这些恶习进行无情的斗争。对这些人的宽恕和纵容，就是政治上的短视。不适当的宽大，会妨害那些受到坏影响的人走上正路。应当及时地采取严格的措施，使各种丑行和与我们公共生活格格不入的不道德的行为，成为我们生活中不可思议的东西。
