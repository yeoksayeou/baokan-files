Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 7th: After revising their production plans, more than 170 state-run farms in Hebei Province can increase their total grain output by 89% and their raw cotton output by 74% compared to last year. The farms in Tongxian Special District have increased their targets by an average of about 8 to 10%. The original plan for cotton production per mu was 200 jin, but it has now been increased to 220 jin. The farms in Baoding Special District originally planned to produce 350 jin of cotton per mu, but after revision, this has been increased to 380 jin, which is more than 170 jin more than last year.

Currently, state-run farms in Hebei Province are launching labor emulation campaigns to achieve the revised new production increase targets. The attendance rate at farms in Handan Special District has reached 95%, which is unprecedented since the establishment of the farm. All farms have completed their sowing tasks on schedule, and seedling emergence is also good. The Shijiazhuang Experimental Farm and four farms in Shijiazhuang and Xingtai have planted more than 700 mu of cotton fields. Except for 40 mu where seedling emergence was incomplete and have been replanted, seedling emergence in the remaining cotton fields is above 90%.

In order to achieve the new targets, all farms have implemented personnel quotas. The State-Run Yongnian Mechanical Farm alone can save more than 250 million yuan in employee wages per year after streamlining personnel. The State-Run Jiheng Mechanical Farm, which lost more than 560 million yuan last year, also plans to make a profit of more than 490 million yuan this year.

    河北省各国营农场提高粮食棉花增产指标
    据新华社保定七日电：河北省一百七十多个国营农场修订生产计划后，粮食总产量可较去年提高百分之八十九，皮棉产量可提高百分之七十四。通县专区各农场平均提高百分之八到十左右，每亩棉花原计划产二百斤，现在提高到二百二十斤。保定专区农场每亩棉花原计划产三百五十斤，修订后提高到三百八十斤，较去年多产一百七十多斤。
    现在，河北省各国营农场正为实现修订后的增产新指标展开劳动竞赛。邯郸专区农场的出勤率达到百分之九十五，这是这个农场建场以来从未有过的现象。各农场播种任务都是按期完成的，出苗也较好。石家庄试验农场和石家庄、邢台等四个农场共种七百多亩棉田，除四十亩出苗不全已补种外，其余棉田出苗都在九成以上。
    各农场为实现新指标，都实行人员定额。仅国营永年机械农场精减人员后，一年就可节省职工工资二亿五千多万元。去年亏损五亿六千多万元的国营冀衡机械农场，今年也计划盈利四亿九千多万元。
