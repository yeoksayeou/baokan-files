Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 9th:
Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates:

    The Geneva Conference has been discussing the restoration of peace in Indochina since May 8th, and today it has been more than a month. The people of the world are eagerly expecting the conference to reach an agreement quickly, the war in Indochina to end soon, and peace in Indochina to be restored as soon as possible.

    During this month, we have held many public and restricted meetings, and with everyone's agreement, we have discussed the restoration of peace in Indochina mainly based on the French delegation's proposal on May 8th and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam delegation's proposal on May 10th. Undeniably, as a result of the previous discussions, we have made some progress and adopted the United Kingdom delegation's proposal at the May 29th meeting. However, considering the time spent and the actual situation of the conference, the achievements of the conference are still insufficient, the pace of the conference is still slow, and our conference is still far from meeting the expectations of the people of the world.

    At the beginning of this conference, the Delegation of the People's Republic of China stated that since the Korean War has ended, the war in Indochina should also end. The early and simultaneous cessation of hostilities throughout Indochina is the most important and urgent step in restoring peace in Indochina. In order to reach an agreement on the ceasefire issue as soon as possible, we have always believed that the conference should affirm the common ground of all parties' opinions as the basis for further negotiation; at the same time, methods should be found to resolve those differences. To this end, the Delegation of the People's Republic of China, on May 27th, proposed the following six points to this conference on the issue of ceasefire, based on the French delegation's proposal, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam delegation's proposal, and the Soviet delegation's supplementary proposal:

    "The countries participating in the Geneva Conference agree on the following basic principles for the cessation of hostilities in Indochina:

    (1) A complete ceasefire shall be implemented simultaneously by all armed forces of the belligerent parties—army, navy, and air force—throughout Indochina.

      (2) The two sides shall begin negotiations on appropriate adjustments to the areas occupied by both sides and the transfer of troops by both sides during the adjustment, as well as other related issues that may arise.

    (3) Simultaneously with the cessation of hostilities throughout Indochina, the entry of all new troops and military personnel, as well as all kinds of weapons and ammunition, from outside Indochina shall cease.

      (4) A joint commission composed of representatives of both command headquarters shall supervise the implementation of the terms of the ceasefire agreement.

    The implementation of the above agreement shall also be subject to international supervision by a neutral nations supervisory commission.
    The issue of the members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission shall be considered separately.

      (5) The countries participating in the Geneva Conference shall be responsible for guaranteeing the implementation of the agreement.
    The issue of the nature of the obligations undertaken by the countries concerned shall be considered separately.

    (6) Mutual release of prisoners of war and detained civilians."

    We believe that these six points contain the common ground of all parties' opinions, and this conference should reach a principled agreement on this. In the process of discussing these six points, we have seen that on some issues, the views of all parties have approached, but on other issues, there is still a great distance between the views of all parties, and some opinions even hinder the progress of the conference. Now, I would like to explain the views of the Delegation of the People's Republic of China in accordance with our six points.

    Regarding the first point. The United Kingdom delegation's proposal, adopted by this conference on May 29th, has clearly stipulated the principle of an early and simultaneous ceasefire in Indochina. The Delegation of the People's Republic of China believes that since the principle has been stipulated, it is necessary to consider, according to this principle, how to achieve the specific issues of an early and simultaneous ceasefire in the three countries of Indochina, namely Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. We believe that the early restoration of peace throughout Indochina without further delay is the desire of the people of the world, especially the people of Indochina and the people of France, and it is also the purpose of holding this conference. However, until now, some people still believe that a ceasefire cannot be simultaneous in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. This is certainly wrong. If hostilities only cease in one region of Indochina while the war continues in other regions, it will not only fail to restore peace in Indochina early but also pose the risk of the war spreading to the entire territory of Indochina at any time. Of course, the specific negotiation procedures for the ceasefire issues in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos may differ in order, but the implementation of the ceasefire must be simultaneous.

    Regarding the second point. In the United Kingdom delegation's proposal adopted by this conference on May 29th, the tasks of the representatives of the command headquarters of the belligerent parties were stipulated as follows: They should study the issue of the deployment of troops at the time of the cessation of hostilities, and this study should begin with the issue of regrouping areas in Vietnam. The Delegation of the People's Republic of China believes that the principle of studying the issue of troop deployment at the time of the cessation of hostilities should undoubtedly apply to the entire territory of Indochina. We also note that the situations in the three countries of Indochina, namely Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, are not exactly the same, and therefore there will be differences in the solutions.

    As everyone knows, Cambodia has resistance forces, and Laos also has resistance forces. These two resistance forces are organized by the people of Cambodia and Laos and led by the wartime governments of the two countries. Some people say that the resistance forces of Cambodia and Laos are not armies organized by their own people and demand that these two armies be withdrawn as a condition for a ceasefire. This is obviously unrealistic and therefore unacceptable. May I ask, how can one demand that the armies organized by the Cambodian and Laotian people themselves withdraw beyond the territory of Cambodia and Laos?

    Now the representatives of the command headquarters of the belligerent parties have begun negotiations in Geneva in accordance with the resolution adopted by this conference on May 29th, which has opened the way for direct negotiations between the belligerent parties. However, it must be pointed out that the contact between the representatives of the command headquarters of the two sides in the local area has not yet begun. This has delayed the comprehensive study and rapid resolution of the issue of troop deployment at the time of the cessation of hostilities. We believe that the relevant parties should immediately take measures to achieve the conference's agreement on the simultaneous contact between the representatives of the command headquarters of both sides in the local area in addition to the talks in Geneva.

    Regarding the third point. The issue of stopping the import of all kinds of new troops and military personnel, as well as all kinds of weapons and ammunition, from outside Indochina at the same time as the cessation of hostilities throughout Indochina was raised by Mr. Pham Van Dong, the chief representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam delegation. The Delegation of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet delegation agreed with Mr. Pham Van Dong's opinion on this issue. Foreign Minister Molotov once pointed out that stopping the transport of troops, weapons, and ammunition is the most important condition for stopping hostilities in Indochina and complying with the relevant agreements. Mr. Bidault, head of the French delegation, also believed that this was an important issue and was the object of all efforts by the International Supervisory Commission. Since everyone has agreed on this principle, the specific issues lie in the scope and method of implementation and how to supervise it. Regarding the scope of implementation, we believe that the belligerent parties in the three countries of Indochina should abide by the regulations on stopping the import of all kinds of new troops and military personnel, as well as all kinds of weapons and ammunition, from outside Indochina through sea, land, and air ports, without any exceptions. At the same time, it should be pointed out that the scope of implementation must include stopping the United States from transporting military personnel, weapons, and ammunition to any place in Indochina. Regarding how to supervise, the experience of the Korean Armistice Agreement can provide us with a reference.

    Some people believe that this principle can only be applied to this country in Indochina and not to that country, such as not applying to Cambodia. This statement is obviously untenable. As everyone knows, the communique of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference called for the restoration of peace throughout Indochina. If these regulations are implemented only in one country in Indochina, while other countries are free to import new troops, or if they do not import new troops but import military personnel and military materials to strengthen their armed forces, then such countries may become military bases for foreign interventionists. In this way, there is a danger that hostilities can resume at any time, and the Indochina ceasefire agreement cannot have a solid foundation.

    Regarding the fourth point. The Delegation of the People's Republic of China believes that in order to supervise the implementation of the terms of the ceasefire agreement, two kinds of supervisory organizations should be established. One is the Joint Commission proposed by Mr. Pham Van Dong, which is the ceasefire commission composed of representatives of the belligerent parties; the other is the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission proposed by Mr. Molotov based on Mr. Bidault's suggestion that an international commission should be established to implement supervision, which is composed of neutral countries invited by this conference upon agreement. I believe that the scope of authority of these two organizations and their mutual relationship can be stipulated with reference to the experience of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The Korean Military Armistice Commission supervised the implementation of the terms of the armistice agreement by the belligerent parties in Korea, such as the implementation of the ceasefire, the withdrawal of military forces from the demilitarized zone, the implementation of various specific arrangements in the demilitarized zone, and the withdrawal of military forces from the other side's rear areas. The Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission was responsible for the supervision, observation, inspection, and investigation of the cessation of the entry of reinforcing military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition from outside Korea, as well as incidents that violated the armistice agreement. These two committees played an active role in all aspects of the implementation of the Korean armistice. Although the supervisory work in Korea is not without shortcomings, these shortcomings can be improved. If someone is discussing the issue of a ceasefire in Indochina and refuses to accept even the basic conditions that are the same as those in the Korean armistice, it is difficult to reach an agreement.

    Regarding supervision, I would now like to mention the following issues:

      (1) The issue of the members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission

    In order to supervise the ceasefire in Indochina, the Soviet delegation proposed that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission be composed of representatives from four countries: India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Pakistan. This is entirely reasonable. However, in this conference, some people insisted on opposing the participation of Poland and Czechoslovakia. The only reason they adopted an attitude of opposition was that Poland and Czechoslovakia are two countries that they call communist countries, and communist countries cannot be neutral countries. This has led to a debate about the definition of a neutral country. What is the correct definition of a neutral country? Article 37 of the Korean Armistice Agreement states it most clearly: "The term 'neutral nation' as herein used is defined as those nations whose combatant forces have not participated in the hostilities in Korea." This is a definition agreed upon by the governments of countries related to the United Nations forces and is also a definition recognized in current international affairs. If ideological systems and social systems are used as the criteria for judging neutral countries, and it is insisted that communist countries cannot be neutral countries, then capitalist countries cannot be neutral countries either. In this case, what neutral countries can there be in the world? Therefore, if it is insisted that countries called communist countries be excluded from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, then this issue of members cannot be agreed upon.

      (2) The issue of the relationship between the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Joint Commission

    The belligerent parties in Indochina should be the subjects of the ceasefire. The implementation of the ceasefire agreement should basically rely on the sincerity of the belligerent parties, so the Joint Commission composed of representatives of the command headquarters of the belligerent parties should first bear the major responsibility of supervising the thorough implementation of the ceasefire agreement. If the belligerent parties do not first take on this major responsibility, may I ask how the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission can impose a ceasefire on the belligerent parties? The Korean Armistice Agreement stipulates: "The general mission of the Military Armistice Commission shall be to supervise the implementation of this Armistice Agreement and to negotiate and settle any incidents of violation of this Armistice Agreement." This is not only entirely reasonable but also entirely necessary. We acknowledge that the belligerent parties in Indochina have fought for eight years. Once a ceasefire is reached, it is not easy to approach, not easy to trust each other, and violations of the ceasefire agreement are inevitable. It is difficult to rely solely on self-examination and reconciliation by both sides, so neutral countries need to implement supervision. However, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission cannot therefore be placed above the Joint Commission. We believe that when discussing the tasks of the Joint Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, there should be no bias or neglect. The relationship between the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Joint Commission should be parallel, not subordinate. These two commissions should cooperate according to the scope of authority stipulated in the ceasefire agreement to ensure the effective implementation of the ceasefire agreement.

      (3) The issue of the principle of unanimous agreement of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission

    There is also the issue in the discussion of whether the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should adopt the principle of unanimous agreement. Some people advocate that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission can solve problems by using the method of majority voting, and oppose the adoption of the principle of unanimous agreement. The Delegation of the People's Republic of China cannot agree with this. We believe that the principle of unanimous agreement is the most just, reasonable, and capable of solving major problems in current international affairs, while the method of majority voting is often used as a tool in major international issues to impose the will of the majority on the minority.

    The task of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is to assist the belligerent parties in supervising the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. Therefore, it must be able to reflect the opinions of both sides and take care of the interests of both sides, and then make fair suggestions that can be accepted by both sides. If the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is biased towards one side and cannot reflect the opinions of both sides and take care of the interests of both sides, and only relies on majority voting to pass suggestions, then it is difficult for this suggestion to be unanimously accepted by both sides.

    Therefore, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should rely on collective efforts, and in accordance with the powers granted by the ceasefire agreement, adopt the principle of unanimous agreement to justly and reasonably resolve major issues and complete the supervisory task. If someone wants to use the method of majority voting to impose the opinions of one belligerent party on the other belligerent party through the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, this is impossible.

    Some people say that the work of the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has been paralyzed due to the observance of the principle of unanimous agreement. This is a false statement. In fact, the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is effective in performing its main functions in accordance with the armistice agreement. In the ten months since the Korean armistice, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has supervised and reviewed the entry and exit of more than two million military personnel from both sides of the armistice and more than 7,000 combat aircraft from the US side into and out of Korea, so that the armistice situation in Korea has not been affected so far. How can it be said that the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is not effective? Mr. Smith's main argument against the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is that the Polish and Czechoslovakian members of the commission have disagreed four times with the investigation of the US side's false accusations that the Korean-Chinese side detained prisoners of war, and this disagreement has precisely maintained the Korean armistice agreement. A contrasting example is that from January 20 to 21, 1954, in order to send the forcibly detained Chinese prisoners of war to Taiwan via Incheon, the US side did not allow the Neutral Nations Inspection Team stationed in Incheon to enter the port for inspection. This was an extremely obvious and serious incident in violation of the armistice agreement. The Polish and Czechoslovakian members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission suggested that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission dispatch a mobile inspection team to Incheon for a special investigation. However, the Swedish and Swiss members did not agree. We did not therefore obliterate the role and achievements of the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, nor did we, like Mr. Smith, propose the statement that capitalist countries are not neutral countries. Another example is that the Korean Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission worked according to the method of majority voting. But what was the result? I have said twice that the important decisions on the disposition of prisoners of war agreed upon by the majority members of India, Poland, and Czechoslovakia were not respected by the minority members, let alone implemented by the United Nations forces. As a result, a stalemate was created in which the US side forcibly detained more than 21,000 Korean-Chinese prisoners of war, which has not been resolved so far.

    It can be seen from this that the experience of the Korean armistice cannot prove in any way that the principle of unanimous agreement is bound to lead to a stalemate, nor can it prove that the method of majority voting is sure not to lead to a stalemate. If it comes to a stalemate, then this stalemate, whether under the circumstances of unanimous agreement or under the circumstances of majority voting, is caused by the US side's violation of certain terms of the armistice agreement in Korea.

      (4) To whom is the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission responsible?

    Regarding this question, we believe that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be responsible to the countries that provide international guarantees for the restoration of peace in Indochina. We have not heard any objections to this question, and we hope that the conference will confirm this point.

      (5) The so-called United Nations Supervision

    In the discussion, some people proposed that the United Nations supervise the implementation of the Indochina ceasefire. The Delegation of the People's Republic of China cannot agree with this. I have repeatedly said that our conference has nothing to do with the United Nations. It goes without saying that the United Nations is not suitable for undertaking the responsibility of supervising the implementation of the Indochina ceasefire. In order to strengthen intervention in the Indochina war, some people are now putting the Indochina issue on the agenda of the United Nations, preparing to create disputes. Under such circumstances, it is even less appropriate to talk about the United Nations being responsible for supervising the Indochina ceasefire.

    Regarding the fifth point. The issue of the participating countries being responsible for guaranteeing the implementation of the ceasefire agreement was raised by Mr. Bidault, head of the French delegation. Since the participating countries in this conference have not raised any objections, we believe that this principle should be confirmed so that it becomes the initial agreement of this conference. At the same time, the Delegation of the People's Republic of China, according to the original proposal, hopes that this conference should discuss the nature of the obligations undertaken by the guarantor countries. Regarding this question, the Delegation of the People's Republic of China supports the opinion put forward by the Soviet delegation, that is, the guarantor countries should consult on actions that violate the ceasefire agreement and take collective but not individual measures.

    Regarding the sixth point. Based on the experience of releasing seriously wounded prisoners of war in Dien Bien Phu, the issue of mutual release of prisoners of war and detained civilians can be easily resolved through direct negotiations between the belligerent parties. Therefore, the Delegation of the People's Republic of China believes that the issue of mutual release of prisoners of war and detained civilians after the ceasefire throughout Indochina can be handed over to the representatives of the command headquarters of both sides for discussion in Geneva and in the local area.

    Mr. Chairman, I said in my speech on May 12th that if the representatives of the participating countries have a sincere desire to restore peace in Indochina, the possibility of the conference reaching an agreement exists. However, I must also point out that there are still many serious obstacles in front of us. We must work together to overcome these obstacles so that our conference can reach an agreement as soon as possible.

    It should be pointed out that the US government's policy of attempting to expand the Indochina war and obstructing the Geneva conference from reaching an agreement has not fundamentally changed. In the Geneva conference, the US delegation has adopted an uncompromising and distrustful attitude towards the conference. At the same time, some delegations often follow the US's obstructing policy. Outside the Geneva conference, the powerful figures in the US government are still advocating and instigating the expansion of the Indochina war, stepping up activities to organize a Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and continuing to create tension in the Far East to threaten peace and security in Asia and the world. This policy of the United States seriously hinders the progress of the Geneva conference.

    It should also be pointed out that the warmongers in France are still keen on the US's interference and expanded aid to the Indochina war during the Geneva conference, and adopt a delaying policy towards the Geneva conference. Recently, the French government and the Bao Dai government held a provisional signing of two treaties, attempting to use this to resist the movement of the Vietnamese people to strive for genuine independence, unity, and democracy, and to hinder the establishment of friendly relations between France and the whole of Vietnam on a new basis. Obviously, these are not conducive to the early restoration of peace in Indochina, and therefore do not conform to the interests of the French people.

    In order to restore peace in Indochina as soon as possible to satisfy the ardent wishes of the peace-loving people of the world, we believe that this policy of obstructing and delaying the Geneva conference from reaching an agreement should no longer be continued.

    Mr. Chairman, the Delegation of the People's Republic of China fully supports the proposal put forward by Mr. Pham Van Dong, the chief representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam delegation, and Mr. Molotov, the chief representative of the Soviet delegation, on June 8 regarding the discussion of political issues in Indochina. As everyone knows, in the eight proposals put forward by Mr. Pham Van Dong to this conference on May 10, its first to sixth items have provided a good basis for the discussion of political issues.

    We believe that in the discussion on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, military issues and political issues are interconnected and cannot be completely separated. Some people advocate that our conference discuss military issues first and then discuss political issues. However, the experience of discussing military issues in our restricted meetings has fully proved that this proposition is not feasible. For example, when discussing the issue of ceasefire and troop regrouping in the three countries of Indochina, it is inevitable to involve the political situation of the three countries; similarly, when discussing issues such as the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and international guarantees, it is inevitable to involve many political issues. It can be seen from this that military issues and political issues cannot be completely separated.

    It seems that some people are also trying to use the Korean armistice as an example, advocating that this Geneva conference only resolve the military armistice issue in Indochina, and leave the political issue of Indochina to be resolved later. This proposition actually wants to postpone the political settlement of the Indochina issue indefinitely, so that peace in Indochina cannot be consolidated, so this is a harmful idea. As everyone knows, Article 60 of the Korean Armistice Agreement stipulates that both sides should convene a political conference to seek a political settlement of the Korean issue. However, due to the obstruction and sabotage of the US government, the political conference has never been convened. One of the tasks of the Geneva conference is to seek a political settlement of the Korean issue. Also due to the delay and obstruction of the US government and its followers, although we have held thirteen discussions on the Korean issue, the conference has not yet yielded any results. At the same time, the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea is clamoring outside the conference to withdraw from the Geneva conference and to unify Korea by force or threat of force. This proves that if the political issue of Korea is not resolved for a long time, the Korean armistice will not be consolidated. Do we want this painful experience of Korea to be repeated in Indochina?

    We have always believed that the task of the Geneva Conference should be to resolve both military and political issues in Indochina. That is to say, we should stop hostilities and restore peace in Indochina on the basis of recognizing the national rights of the people of the three countries of Indochina. Only when political issues are resolved can peace in Indochina be consolidated and lasting. Therefore, the Delegation of the People's Republic of China supports the three proposals of the Soviet delegation on June 8, requesting that this conference immediately begin parallel and alternating discussions on military and political issues in Indochina, and ensure direct contact between the parties concerned, so that an agreement on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina can be reached quickly, so that the early and simultaneous ceasefire throughout Indochina can be realized first.

### 在日内瓦会议六月九日会议上  周恩来外长的发言

专栏：

    在日内瓦会议六月九日会议上
    周恩来外长的发言主席先生、各位代表先生：
    日内瓦会议从五月八日讨论恢复印度支那和平问题以来，到今天已经超过一个月了。全世界人民都在殷切地期待着会议能够迅速达成协议，印度支那的战争能够早日停止，印度支那的和平能够早日恢复。
    在这一个月中，我们召开了多次公开性的和限制性的会议，并经大家同意，以法国代表团五月八日的建议和越南民主共和国代表团五月十日的建议为主要基础，对恢复印度支那和平进行了讨论。不可否认，经过历次讨论的结果，我们获得了某些进展，并在五月二十九日的会议上，通过了联合王国代表团的建议。但是，如果从一个月的时间和会议的实际情况来看，会议的成就还是很不够的，会议进行的速度还是很缓慢的，我们的会议还很不能满足全世界人民的期望。
    在本会议开始的时候，中华人民共和国代表团就曾声明，朝鲜战争停止了，印度支那战争同样应该停止。在印度支那全境早日同时停止敌对行为是恢复印度支那和平的一个最重要和最迫切的步骤。为了使停战问题早日达成协议，我们始终认为，会议应该把各方意见的共同点肯定下来，作为进一步商谈的基础；同时，对那些差异点，应该寻找方法加以解决。为此，中华人民共和国代表团在五月二十七日曾根据法国代表团的建议、越南民主共和国代表团的建议和苏联代表团的补充建议，在关于停战问题上向本会议提出了下列的六点建议：
    “日内瓦会议与会各国对于在印度支那停止敌对行动的基本原则协议如下：
    （一）交战双方的一切武装力量——陆军、海军和空军——在印度支那全境同时实现完全的停火。
      （二）双方就有关双方占领区的地区的适当调整和在进行调整时双方军队的转移，以及可能发生的其他有关问题，开始谈判。
    （三）在印度支那全境停止敌对行动的同时，停止自印度支那境外进入各种新的部队和军事人员以及各种武器和弹药。
      （四）由双方司令部代表组成的联合委员会，对停战协定条款的履行，进行监察。
    对上述协定的履行，并应由中立国委员会进行国际监察。
    关于中立国委员会的成员问题，须另行考虑。
      （五）日内瓦会议与会各国负责保证协定的履行。
    关于有关各国所承担的义务的性质问题，须另行考虑。
    （六）互相释放战俘和被拘的平民。”
    我们认为，这六点建议是包括了各方意见的共同点的，本会议应该就此达成原则协议。在讨论这六点建议的过程中，我们看到，在某些问题上各方观点已经接近，但是在另外一些问题上，各方意见却还有很大的距离，其中某些意见甚至还障碍着会议的进行。现在，我愿按照我们的六点建议，说明一下中华人民共和国代表团的意见。
    关于第一点建议。本会议在五月二十九日通过的联合王国代表团的建议中，已经对在印度支那早日和同时停火的原则作了明确的规定。中华人民共和国代表团认为，原则既经规定了，那就必须根据这一原则来考虑在印度支那三个国家，即在越南、高棉和寮国，怎样实现早日和同时停火的具体问题。我们认为，早日恢复印度支那全境的和平而不再拖延，是全世界人民、特别是印度支那人民和法国人民的渴望，同时，也是举行本会议的目的。但是，直到现在还有人认为，在越南、高棉和寮国可以不同时停火。这当然是不对的。如果只在印度支那某一地区停止敌对行动，而在另一些地区却继续着战争，那就不仅不能早日恢复印度支那的和平，而且随时有使战争重新蔓延到印度支那全境的危险。固然，有关越南、高棉、寮国停战问题的具体商谈程序可以有先后，但在停火的实现上却必须同时。
    关于第二点建议。本会议在五月二十九日所通过的联合王国代表团的建议中，对交战双方司令部代表的任务作了这样的规定：他们应研究在停止敌对行动时军队的部署问题，这项研究应从在越南的重新集结地区问题开始。中华人民共和国代表团认为，研究在停止敌对行动时军队的部署问题的原则，无疑地应该适用于印度支那全境。我们同时也注意到印度支那三个国家，即越南、高棉、寮国的情况是不完全相同的，因而在解决办法上将会有所不同。
    大家知道，高棉有抵抗军队，寮国也有抵抗军队，这两支抵抗军队是由高棉和寮国的本国人民组织起来而为两国抗战政府所领导的。有人说高棉和寮国的抵抗军队不是他们本国人民组织起来的军队，而要求将这两支军队加以撤退，作为停火的条件，这显然是不现实的，因而也是不能接受的。试问，怎样能够要求高棉和寮国本国人民自己组织起来的军队撤退到高棉和寮国的领土以外去呢？
    现在交战双方司令部代表已经按照本会议五月二十九日通过的决议在日内瓦开始谈判，这就为交战双方直接的谈判开辟了道路。但不能不指出，双方司令部代表在当地的接触至今尚未开始。这样，就拖延了对于停止敌对行动时军队部署问题的全面研究和迅速解决。我们认为，有关方面应该立即采取措施，早日实现本会议关于双方司令部代表除在日内瓦会谈外，同时在当地开始接触的协议。
    关于第三点建议。在印度支那全境停止敌对行动的同时，停止自印度支那境外运入各种新的部队和军事人员以及各种武器和弹药的问题，是越南民主共和国代表团首席代表范文同先生提出的。中华人民共和国代表团和苏联代表团同意范文同先生对这一问题的意见。莫洛托夫外长曾指出，停止运送军队、武器和弹药是在印度支那停止敌对行动和遵守有关协定的最重要的条件。法国代表团团长皮杜尔先生也曾认为这是一个重要的问题，是国际监察委员会必须尽一切努力的对象。既然大家同意了这一个原则，那么，具体的问题就在于实施的范围和方法以及如何加以监察。关于实施的范围，我们认为，印度支那三个国家交战双方均应遵守停止自印度支那境外经过海、陆、空口岸运入各种新的部队和军事人员以及各种武器和弹药的规定，不能有任何例外。同时，应该指出，实施范围一定要包括停止美国运送军事人员、武器和弹药到印度支那任何地方在内。关于如何监察问题，朝鲜停战协定的经验可以提供我们参考。
    有人认为，这个原则只能适用于印度支那的这一个国家，而不适用于那一个国家，例如不适用于高棉。这种说法显然是站不住的。大家知道，柏林四外长会议的公报，是要求在印度支那全境恢复和平。如果在印度支那仅仅一个国家实行这些规定，而另外的国家却可以自由地运入新的部队，或者不运入新的部队，而运入军事人员和军事物资来加强它的武装力量，那么，这种国家就有可能变成外国干涉者的军事基地。这样一来，就构成了敌对行动随时可以再起的危险，印度支那的停战协定也就不可能具有巩固的基础。
    关于第四点建议。中华人民共和国代表团认为，为了对停战协定条款的履行，进行监察，应该建立两种监察组织。一种是范文同先生提议的联合委员会，也就是由交战双方代表组成的停战委员会；另一种是莫洛托夫先生根据皮杜尔先生关于应成立国际委员会实行监察的建议而提出的由本会议协议邀请的中立国家来组成的中立国监察委员会。这两种组织的职权范围和它们的相互关系，我认为，可参照朝鲜停战协定的经验加以规定。朝鲜军事停战委员会监督了朝鲜交战双方对停战协定条款的实施，例如实现停火，双方军事力量撤出非军事区，进行非军事区内的各项具体安排，双方军事力量撤出对方的后方地区等等。朝鲜中立国监察委员会则对停止自朝鲜境外进入增援的军事人员、作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器和弹药以及对违反停战协定的事件，担任了监察、观察、视察和调查的职责。这两个委员会从各方面对朝鲜停战的实现都起了积极的作用。虽然在朝鲜的监察工作不是没有缺点的，但是这种缺点是可以改进的。如果有人在讨论印度支那停战问题的时候，就连与朝鲜停战中基本相同的条件都不肯接受，那是很难达成协议的。
    关于监察方面，我现在还要提到下列几个问题：
      （一）中立国监察委员会的成员问题
    为了在印度支那监督停战，苏联代表团曾建议由印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和巴基斯坦四个国家的代表组成中立国监察委员会。这是完全合理的。然而，在本会议中，有人就硬要反对波兰和捷克斯洛伐克两国参加。他们采取反对态度的唯一理由就在于波兰和捷克斯洛伐克是两个被他们称为共产主义的国家，而共产主义国家就不能成为中立国家。这样就引起了关于中立国家的定义的争论。什么是中立国家的正确定义呢？朝鲜停战协定第三十七款规定得最清楚：“本停战协定所用‘中立国’一词的定义为未有战斗部队参加在朝鲜的敌对行为的国家。”这是与联合国军有关的各国政府所同意了的定义，也是在目前国际事务中所公认的定义。如果拿思想体系和社会制度来作为判断中立国家的标准，硬说共产主义国家不能成为中立国家，那么，资本主义国家同样也不能成为中立国家了。这样一来，世界上还能有什么中立国家呢？所以如果硬要将被称为共产主义的国家排除在中立国监察委员会之外，那么，这个成员问题就无法达成协议了。
      （二）中立国监察委员会和联合委员会的关系问题
    印度支那交战双方应当是停战的主体。停战协定的实现基本上应该依靠交战双方的诚意，因而由交战双方总司令部代表所组成的联合委员会就应该首先负起监督停战协定彻底实施的重大责任。如果交战双方不首先将这个重大责任担负起来，试问中立国监察委员会又怎样能够将停战强加于交战双方呢？朝鲜停战协定这样规定：“军事停战委员会的总任务为监督本停战协定的实施及协商处理任何违反本停战协定的事件。”这不仅是完全合理的，并且是完全必要的。我们承认印度支那交战双方打了八年的仗，一旦达成停战，不易接近，不易互相信任，难免有些违反停战协定的事件发生，光靠双方自行审查和和解是有困难的，因而需要中立国实行监察。但是，不能因此将中立国监察委员会放在联合委员会之上。我们认为，在讨论联合委员会和中立国监察委员会的任务时，不能有所偏重，也不能有所偏废。中立国监察委员会和联合委员会的关系应该是平行的，而不是隶属的。这两个委员会应该根据停战协定所规定的职权范围，分工合作，以保障停战协定的有效实施。
      （三）中立国监察委员会一致协议的原则问题
    在讨论中还存在这样一个问题，即中立国监察委员会应否采取一致协议的原则问题。有人主张在中立国监察委员会中只要使用多数表决的方法就能解决问题，而反对采取一致协议的原则。对于这一点，中华人民共和国代表团是不能同意的。我们认为一致协议的原则是目前国际事务中最公正、最合理、最能解决重大问题的一种原则，而多数表决的方法，在重大的国际问题上，却常常被利用来作为工具，以图将多数国家一方的意志强加于少数国家的一方。
  中立国监察委员会的任务是为了协助交战双方监察停战协定的实施，因而，它就必须能够反映双方的意见和照顾双方的利益，然后才能作出公正的建议而为双方所接受。如果中立国监察委员会偏于一方而不能反映双方的意见和照顾双方的利益，又仅仅依靠多数表决就通过建议，那么，这个建议就很难为双方所一致接受。
    因此，中立国监察委员会应该依靠集体的努力，根据停战协定所赋予的权力，采取一致协议的原则，才能公正地、合理地解决重大问题，完成监察任务，如果有人想利用多数表决的方法，通过中立国监察委员会将交战一方的意见强加于交战的另一方，这是办不到的。
    有人说，朝鲜中立国监察委员会的工作，是由于遵守一致协议的原则而陷于瘫痪的，这是一种错误的说法。事实上，朝鲜中立国监察委员会在根据停战协定执行它的主要职司方面是有效的。朝鲜停战十个月来，中立国监察委员会对停战双方二百万以上的军事人员和美方七千架以上的作战飞机进出朝鲜进行了监察和审查，使朝鲜的停战局势至今未受影响。怎样能说朝鲜中立国监察委员会不是有效的呢？史密斯先生反对朝鲜中立国监察委员会的主要论据，是说该委员会波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员曾四次不同意调查美方指控朝中方面扣留战俘的诬告，而这种不同意却正是维护了朝鲜的停战协定。相反的例子，一九五四年一月二十日至二十一日美方为了将强迫扣留的中国被俘人员经过仁川送往台湾，不准常驻仁川的中立国视察小组进入港口进行视察工作。这是一件极其明显的违反停战协定的严重事件。中立国监察委员会的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员建议中立国监察委员会派遣机动视察小组到仁川去进行特别调查。但瑞典和瑞士委员却未予同意。我们并未因此就抹煞朝鲜中立国监察委员会的作用和功绩，我们也未因此就像史密斯先生那样提出资本主义国家不是中立国的说法。还有一种例子，朝鲜中立国遣返委员会是根据多数表决的方法工作的。但结果怎样呢？我已经说过两次，印度、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克多数委员所同意的关于处置战俘的重要决定，少数委员并不加以尊重，更未被联合国军方面所执行。结果，就造成了美方强迫扣留二万一千余名朝中被俘人员的僵局，至今尚未解决。
    由此可见，朝鲜停战的经验丝毫不能证明一致协议的原则势必产生僵局，也不能证明多数表决的方法就一定不产生僵局。如果说到僵局，那么，这种僵局不论是在一致协议的情况下，或是在多数表决的情况下，都是由于美方在朝鲜破坏某些停战协定条款而产生的。
      （四）中立国监察委员会对谁负责的问题
    关于这个问题，我们认为，中立国监察委员会应对为恢复印度支那和平提供国际保证的国家负责。我们还没有听到对这一问题的反对意见，我们希望会议把这一点确定下来。
      （五）所谓联合国监察问题
    在讨论中，有人提议由联合国来监察印度支那停战的实施，中华人民共和国代表团对此是无法同意的。我已经一再说过，我们的会议和联合国没有关系。不言而喻，联合国是不适合于担负监察印度支那停战实施的职责的。为了加强干涉印度支那战争，现在正有人将印度支那问题放在联合国的议程上，准备制造纠纷。在这种情况下，是更不应该谈到由联合国来负责监察印度支那的停战了。
    关于第五点建议。与会各国负责保证停战协定的履行的问题是法国代表团团长皮杜尔先生提出的。由于本会议的参与国家没有提出任何反对的意见，我们认为，这一条原则应该确定下来，使它成为本会议的初步协议。同时，中华人民共和国代表团根据原来的建议，希望本会议对保证国家所承担的义务性质问题应该加以讨论。对于这个问题，中华人民共和国代表团支持苏联代表团所提出的意见，那就是保证国家对于违反停战协定的行为应该进行协商，采取集体的但不是个别的措施。
    关于第六点建议。根据奠边府释放重伤俘的经验，互相释放战俘和被拘平民的问题经过交战双方直接谈判，是不难获得解决的。因此，中华人民共和国代表团认为，在印度支那全境停火后互相释放战俘和被拘平民的问题可交由双方司令部代表在日内瓦并在当地进行讨论。
    主席先生，我在五月十二日的发言中曾经说过：如果与会各国代表都具有恢复印度支那和平的真诚愿望，会议达成协议的可能性是存在的。但是，我也不能不指出，摆在我们面前的还有许多严重的障碍。我们必须共同努力来克服这些障碍，才能使我们的会议早日达成协议。
    应该指出，美国政府企图扩大印度支那战争和阻挠日内瓦会议达成协议的政策基本上还没有改变。在日内瓦会议中，美国代表团采取着一种不妥协和对会议不信任的态度。同时，有一些代表团也常常追随着美国的这种阻挠政策。在日内瓦会议外，美国政府中的当权人物仍在鼓吹和策动扩大印度支那的战争，加紧进行组织东南亚侵略集团的活动，并继续在远东制造紧张局势，以威胁亚洲及世界的和平和安全。美国的这种政策，严重地障碍着日内瓦会议的进展。
    还应该指出，法国的主战派，在日内瓦会议期间，仍然热中于美国对印度支那战争的干涉和扩大援助，而对于日内瓦会议则采取拖延政策。最近，法国政府又和保大政府举行了两个条约的临时签字，企图以此对抗越南人民争取真正的独立、统一和民主的运动，并阻碍着法国和整个越南在新的基础上建立友好关系。显然，这些都是不利于印度支那和平的早日恢复的，因此也是不符合于法国人民的利益的。
    为了使印度支那的和平得以早日恢复，以满足全世界爱好和平人民的热望，我们认为，这种阻挠和拖延日内瓦会议达成协议的政策，是不应该再继续下去的了。
    主席先生，中华人民共和国代表团完全支持六月八日越南民主共和国代表团首席代表范文同先生和苏联代表团首席代表莫洛托夫先生提出的关于讨论印度支那政治问题的建议。大家知道，在范文同先生五月十日向本会议所提出的八项建议中，它的第一项至第六项已经为政治问题的讨论提供了良好的基础。
    我们认为，在关于恢复印度支那和平问题的讨论中，军事问题和政治问题是互相联系、不可能完全分开的。有人主张我们的会议将军事问题讨论完毕后再讨论政治问题。但是，在我们限制性会议中讨论军事问题的经验，已经充分证明了这种主张是行不通的。例如，在讨论到印度支那三个国家的停战问题和部队集结问题的时候，就不能不牵涉到三个国家的政治情况；同样，在讨论到中立国监察委员会和国际保证等问题的时候，也不能不涉及许多政治问题。由此可见，军事问题和政治问题是不可能完全分开的。
    似乎还有人企图以朝鲜的停战为例，主张这次日内瓦会议只解决印度支那的军事停战问题，而把印度支那的政治问题留待以后再行解决。这种主张实际上是要把印度支那问题的政治解决无限期地拖延下去，使印度支那的和平无法巩固，因此这是有害的想法。大家知道，朝鲜停战协定第六十款规定了双方召开政治会议来谋取朝鲜问题的政治解决。可是，由于美国政府的阻挠和破坏，政治会议始终未能召开。日内瓦会议的任务之一就在于谋取朝鲜问题的政治解决。同样由于美国政府和它的追随者的拖延和阻挠，虽然我们已经举行了十三次关于朝鲜问题的讨论，但会议至今仍无结果。同时，南朝鲜的李承晚集团又在会外叫嚣，要退出日内瓦会议，并以武力或武力威胁来统一朝鲜。这就证明，朝鲜的政治问题如果长期不得解决，朝鲜的停战就将一直不能巩固。难道还要使朝鲜的这种痛苦经验又在印度支那重演么？
    我们始终认为，日内瓦会议的任务应该是，使印度支那的军事问题和政治问题都获得解决。这就是说，我们应该在承认印度支那三国人民的民族权利的基础上，停止敌对行为，恢复印度支那的和平。只有政治问题获得解决，印度支那的和平才能巩固和持久。因此，中华人民共和国代表团赞成苏联代表团六月八日的三项建议，要求本会议对印度支那军事问题和政治问题，立即开始进行平行的轮番的讨论，并保证有关双方进行直接接触，以便使恢复印度支那和平问题的协议，能够迅速达成，使印度支那全境的早日和同时停火，能够首先实现。
