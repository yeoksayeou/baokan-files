Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 6th: The Eleventh All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions Congress will open in Moscow on the 7th. Delegates from all over the country are arriving in Moscow one after another to attend the congress. They bring with them the production good news from their departments, reporting on the implementation of the guarantees they put forward in the competition to greet the congress.

Currently, workers everywhere are enthusiastically welcoming the congress with production achievements. Many enterprises in Leningrad have completed their plans for the first five months of this year ahead of schedule to welcome the congress. The employees of the Leningrad "Fiber" Factory completed their five-month production task on May 14th. They over-produced products worth hundreds of thousands of rubles. Thousands of workers at the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant completed two to three quotas every day to welcome the congress. Recently, the factory has begun assembling a new giant machine - an automatic mobile excavator, which is equipped with a bucket with a volume of fourteen cubic meters and a boom of up to seventy-five meters. The Alayarov drilling team of the Bashkir oil field drilled an oil well in an unprecedentedly short period of time - nineteen days and nights, while the stipulated period was fifty days and nights. The drilling speed of the team has broken the record, reaching a level of 2,512 meters drilled per drilling rig per month. Ni. Chikarin, a famous turner in Tula, installed a tool holder on his lathe during the period of welcoming the congress, which shortened the installation time of the workpiece by more than one-half and made the turner's work easier and simpler. Last year, the production of Chikarin and his comrades reached 180 to 200 percent of the quota, while this year's production has reached 300 percent.

In the past few days, many trade union delegations from abroad have continued to arrive in Moscow to participate in the Eleventh All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions Congress. Among them are delegations from the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Free German Trade Union Federation, the Romanian General Trade Union, and the Hungarian Trade Union, as well as trade union delegations from West Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria, representatives from the Brazilian Workers' Confederation, the Latin American Labor Confederation, and the Indian Labor Association.

    迎接第十一届全苏工会代表大会
    苏联工人接连获得新的生产成就
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：第十一届全苏工会代表大会将于七日在莫斯科开幕。全国各地参加大会的代表正陆续到达莫斯科。他们带来了自己部门的生产捷报，报告他们在迎接代表大会的竞赛中所提出的保证的执行情况。
    目前各地工人正热情地以生产成就迎接代表大会。列宁格勒许多企业为迎接代表大会而提前完成了今年头五个月的计划。列宁格勒“纤维”工厂的职工在五月十四日就完成了五个月的生产任务。他们超计划生产了价值几十万卢布的产品。乌拉尔重型机器制造厂的几千名工人为迎接代表大会每天完成了两个到三个定额。最近该厂已开始装配一种新的巨型机器——自动移动挖掘机，这种机器装有一个容积为十四立方公尺的掘斗和一个长达七十五公尺的吊臂。巴什基尔油田阿拉雅罗夫钻探队在空前短的期间——十九昼夜之内钻好了一口石油井，而规定期限为五十昼夜。该队的钻探速度已打破了纪录，达到每架钻探机每月钻进二千五百一十二公尺的水平。图拉城著名车工尼·契卡林在迎接代表大会期间，在自己的车床上安装了一个工具胎，使得安装工作物的时间缩短二分之一以上并且使车工的工作减轻和简单化。去年，契卡林和他的同伴的生产达到定额的百分之一百八十到二百，而今年的生产已达到百分之三百。
    这几天来，继续有许多来自国外的工会代表团到达莫斯科参加第十一届全苏工会代表大会。其中有世界工会联合会、自由德国工会联合会、罗马尼亚总工会和匈牙利工会的代表团以及西德、荷兰和奥地利的工会代表团，巴西工人联盟、拉丁美洲劳工联盟和印度劳工协会的代表等。
