Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 3rd. The Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company has successfully built a 1,200-horsepower diesel double-propeller tugboat. The first tugboat was test-sailed on April 14th, and it sailed for 54 hours under the impact of gale-force winds of level 7 to 8 and huge waves. The results proved that the ship was very strongly built and performed very well.

The 1,200-horsepower tugboat is an ocean-going tugboat that can sail in the ocean for 27 days without needing to dock. It has a large towing capacity and is fast. In addition to towing barges at sea, it can also be used for maritime rescue. The tugboat is a new type of vessel, which is sturdy, flexible, and very safe to navigate. All the equipment in various systems of the ship is operated electrically. Many machines on board, such as propellers and thrust bearings, can be used interchangeably, so there is no need to bring spares for every machine when sailing. The design of the ship also fully takes into account the working and living conditions of the crew members who work at sea all year round. On the ship, senior crew members have a beautiful room each, and ordinary crew members have a room for two. There are restaurants, clubs, changing rooms, bathrooms and cold storage rooms, etc. Each crew member has an average of 8.5 square meters of living and activity space, which is much more spacious than ordinary ships.

The first new tugboat was successfully built under the care and direct participation of Soviet experts. Before the official construction, Soviet experts provided three different construction plans. After careful comparison and research to learn from each other's strengths, an economical and good plan was determined. During the construction process, Soviet experts never left the shipyard. From the beginning to the completion of the first tugboat, Soviet experts put forward more than 140 suggestions for modifying and adding structures, which not only ensured the quality of the ship, but also accelerated the speed of shipbuilding.

    中苏造船公司建造成功第一只远洋拖船
    【新华社大连三日电】中苏造船公司建造一千二百匹马力柴油机双螺旋桨拖船成功。四月十四日第一只拖船进行了试航，在七级到八级大风和巨浪的冲击下，航行了五十四小时，结果证明船的建造十分坚固，性能很好。
   一千二百匹马力的拖船是一只远洋拖船，它可以在海洋里航行二十七天不必靠岸。它的拖引能力很大，速度快，除可以在海上拖驳船外，又可作海上救生之用。拖船是一种新式船只，既坚固、灵活，航行又很安全。全船各种系统的设备都是用电气来操纵。船上很多机器，如推进器、推力轴承等重要机件可以互换使用，因而出航时就不需要把每部机器的备品都带上。船只的设计也充分照顾到常年在海上从事劳动的船员们的工作与生活条件。在船上，高级船员每人有一个精美的房间，一般船员两个人有一个房间。船上有餐厅、俱乐部、更衣室和洗澡间和冷藏室等。每个船员平均有八点五平方公尺的居住和活动面积，比一般船只宽敞得多。
    第一只新拖船是在苏联专家的关怀和直接参与下建造成功的。在正式施工以前，苏联专家曾提供了三个不同的建造方案，经仔细对比研究取长补短之后，确定出一个既经济又好的方案。在施工过程中，苏联专家一直没离开造船厂。从开始到第一只拖船建成，苏联专家共提出修改和加添结构的意见达一百四十多条，既保证了船的质量，又加快了造船的速度。
