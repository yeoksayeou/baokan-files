Xinhua News Agency, June 7th: U.S. representative Smith, attending the Geneva Conference, recently deliberately distorted the facts and vigorously slandered the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea in an attempt to completely obliterate the role of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in guaranteeing the Korean armistice. The trick played by Smith is a step in the overall plan of the U.S. authorities to obstruct and sabotage the Geneva Conference.

However, the contributions and achievements made by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in assisting the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement cannot be overturned by the slander of Smith and his ilk. Since the Korean armistice, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has conducted regular monitoring and inspection of the rotation of military personnel and the replacement of war materials at rear ports in both North and South Korea. From the Korean armistice to May 15th of this year, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has monitored and inspected the rotation of more than 478,000 military personnel by the Korean Armistice parties, more than 1,393,000 military personnel entering and leaving the country on temporary assignments, and the replacement of more than 7,500 combat aircraft, more than 600 armored vehicles, more than 1,000 various cannons, more than 5,800 machine guns, more than 133,000 various guns, more than 76,000 artillery shells, more than 19,000 bombs, and more than 126 million bullets. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has also conducted special investigations without delay into requests made by both sides of the Korean Armistice for investigations into violations of the armistice agreement, as long as they comply with the provisions of the armistice agreement. The facts are very clear that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has done a lot of work and played an active role in supervising the implementation of the clauses related to guaranteeing the stability of the military armistice in the armistice agreement.

Admittedly, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission still faces some difficulties in its work. However, these difficulties are entirely due to the United States' willful violation of the armistice agreement, its obstruction and restriction of the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in various ways, and the transportation of large numbers of reinforcement military personnel and war materials into South Korea. The United States should bear full responsibility for the emergence and existence of these difficulties.

Similarly, the rumors and slanders of Smith and his ilk cannot damage the fair and impartial stance of the Czechoslovak and Polish members. In order to guarantee the stability of the Korean military armistice, the Czechoslovak and Polish members, regardless of the U.S. authorities' obstruction and restrictions, have consistently adhered to monitoring and inspection work, and have impartially exposed the serious violations of the armistice agreement by the United States. It is clear that the fair, impartial, proactive and responsible work of the Czechoslovak and Polish members has played a significant role in safeguarding the power of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to perform its legal functions and preventing the United States from wantonly violating the armistice agreement. The U.S. authorities' continuous and malicious attacks on the Czechoslovak and Polish members are because their impartial stance is a serious obstacle to the United States' desire to completely disregard the armistice agreement.

The facts are very clear that Smith's wanton slander and defamation of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, as well as the Czechoslovak and Polish members, and his opposition to the establishment of a fair Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Indochina that reflects the opinions of both sides and takes into account the interests of both sides in supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement, are entirely aimed at obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue and delaying the Geneva Conference so that the United States can buy time to carry out military preparations and expand the war in Indochina.

    史密斯诽谤朝鲜中立国监察委员会捷波委员
    证明这是美国破坏日内瓦会议的一个步骤
    【新华社七日讯】出席日内瓦会议的美国代表史密斯最近在会上故意颠倒事实，大肆诽谤朝鲜中立国监察委员会捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员，企图完全抹煞中立国监察委员会对保证朝鲜停战所起的作用。史密斯玩弄的这个花样，是美国当局阻挠和破坏日内瓦会议的整个计划中的一个步骤。
    但是，中立国监察委员会对协助朝鲜停战协定的实施所作出的贡献和成绩，不是史密斯之流的谰言所能推翻得了的。自朝鲜停战以来，中立国监察委员会在南、北朝鲜的后方口岸对军事人员的轮换和作战物资的替换进行了经常的监察和视察。自朝鲜停战以来到今年五月十五日，中立国监察委员会监察和视察了朝鲜停战双方进行轮换的军事人员四十七万八千余名，担任临时任务出境入境的军事人员一百三十九万三千余名，和进行替换的作战飞机七千五百多架，装甲车辆六百多辆，各种炮一千多门，机枪五千八百多挺，各种枪支十三万三千余支，炮弹七万六千多颗，炸弹一万九千多颗，枪弹一亿二千六百多万发。中立国监察委员会还对朝鲜停战双方提出的调查违反停战协定事件的要求，只要它们符合停战协定的规定，都毫不延迟地进行了特别调查。事实十分清楚，中立国监察委员会对于监督停战协定中有关保证军事停战稳定的条款的实施是做了很多的工作，并且起了积极的作用的。
    诚然，中立国监察委员会在它的工作中还存在着若干困难。但是，这些困难完全是由于美国恣意违反停战协定，对中立国监察委员会的工作多方加以阻挠和限制，把大批增援性的军事人员和作战物资运入南朝鲜所造成的。美国应对这些困难的产生和存在负完全的责任。
    同样，史密斯之流的造谣诽谤，一点也不能损害捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员的公正无私的立场。捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员为了保证朝鲜军事停战的稳定，不顾美国当局的百般阻挠和限制，始终不渝地坚持了监察和视察的工作，并且公正无私地揭露了美国严重违反停战协定的行为。很显然，捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员这种公正无私、积极负责的工作，对维护中立国监察委员会执行合法职司的权力和防止美国肆无忌惮地违反停战协定起了重大的作用。美国当局对捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员不断地进行恶毒的攻击，就是为了他们的这种公正立场对美国要完全放手地违反停战协定是一个严重的障碍。
    事实非常清楚，史密斯在会上大肆诬蔑和诽谤中立国监察委员会以及捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员，反对在印度支那组成一个反映双方意见、照顾双方利益的公正监督停战协定实施的中立国监察委员会，完全是为了阻挠印度支那问题的和平解决和拖延日内瓦会议，以便美国取得时间来进行军事准备，扩大印度支那的战争。
