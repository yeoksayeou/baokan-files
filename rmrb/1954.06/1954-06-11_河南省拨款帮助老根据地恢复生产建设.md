Henan Province Allocates Funds to Help Old Revolutionary Base Areas Restore Production and Construction

The People's Government of Henan Province, in order to further strengthen the economic recovery and construction work in the old revolutionary base areas, allocated 11.18 billion yuan in production and construction subsidies to the old base areas of Xin County, Yongcheng, Neihuang, Qingfeng, Hua County, Queshan, Dongming, Biyang, and Tongbai in late May for key support. Sixty-two percent of these funds will be mainly used for transportation and water conservancy construction. In terms of transportation, it is planned to repair the highway from Guangshanzhaihe to Xin County and the section from Queshan to Zhugou. In terms of water conservancy, small reservoirs in Xin County, such as the Bazimenlou, will be built, and rivers such as the Shahe in Neihuang, the Jia Gong River and Liuqing River in Hua County, and the Han Gou River and Huilong Gou in Yongcheng will be dredged. The remaining funds will be used to subsidize impoverished people in the old areas to solve difficulties in repairing houses and purchasing farm animals and tools. In addition to 600 million yuan for building schoolhouses and health clinics, it can also help the masses build more than 6,200 houses, purchase more than 1,800 draft animals, 560 carts, 920 waterwheels, and more than 22,000 other large farm tools (plows, harrows, etc.). Through this economic support, the people in the old areas will be greatly encouraged to carry forward the revolutionary tradition, overcome the difficulties in economic recovery and construction, and rapidly change the economic outlook of the old revolutionary base areas with poor recovery and construction.
