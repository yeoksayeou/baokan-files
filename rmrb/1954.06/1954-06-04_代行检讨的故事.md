It is said that this factory director is extremely arrogant,
But now it seems that is not necessarily so.
As soon as he entered the office of the Municipal Party Secretary,
He appeared exceptionally humble and honest.
The Secretary's voice contained anger:
"The masses have exposed many of your mistakes,
But you have never made a self-criticism.
This time you have finally made some slight progress."
The factory director's face immediately showed delight,
And he spoke in an even softer and more tactful tone:
"I always wanted to examine my own work,
But unfortunately, I just didn't have enough time."
The Secretary pointed to the report on the desk and said:
"No, what you have written here is not profound enough.
You've been given many labels of bureaucratism,
But important facts have been glossed over lightly..."
The factory director suddenly exclaimed in surprise:
"This is not my self-criticism!
No, maybe it's my secretary...
He…he…must have made a mistake!”
The Secretary smiled sarcastically:
"Then whose self-criticism is this?
Your seal is stamped on it,
Could it be someone is impersonating you!"
The factory director gently picked up the report,
And asked the Secretary in a trembling voice for instructions:
"Let me go back and investigate,
There must be something wrong here."
The Secretary's tone was particularly heavy:
"A Communist Party member must be loyal to the Party!
You can go back for further reflection,
Anyway, this time we must investigate your mistakes thoroughly."
Before the Secretary finished speaking,
The factory director turned and ran out.
He ran all the way back to the factory,
And abruptly pushed open the door of the secretary's office.
The secretary was already standing in front of him,
But he shouted in a hoarse voice:
"Who wrote this self-criticism?
Who stamped my seal on it?"
"It...it was me who wrote the self-criticism for you,
It was me who stamped your seal on it..."
Before the secretary could finish speaking,
He slammed his hand on the desk, knocking over the teapot.
"This is simply outrageous,
How can you write a self-criticism so casually?
Do you still want to continue working here?
I will dismiss you from your position immediately!"
The secretary's words were full of grievance:
"You told me to write this self-criticism,
After I finished it, I submitted it to you,
You sent it out without even looking at it."
The factory director was silent for a long time,
And then reprimanded the secretary in a low voice:
"This is still your mistake,
Who told you to write something that the superiors are not satisfied with!"
"Okay, let the past be the past,
I want to see what you can do this time.
This time it must be written profoundly,
Less labelling, more specific facts!"

    代行检讨的故事
    马铁丁
    都说这位厂长傲慢无比，
    现在看来倒也未必。
    他一走进市委书记办公室，
    就显得格外谦虚又老实。
    书记的声音里含着愤怒：
  “群众揭发了你许多错误，
    你却从来也没有检讨过。
    这次总算有了些微进步。”
    厂长脸上立刻浮出喜欢，
    话说得更加柔和委婉：
    “我老想把自己的工作检查一遍，
    可惜就是没有足够的时间。”
    书记指着桌上的报告书说：
    “不，你这里写得并不深刻，
    官僚主义帽子戴了许多，
    重要事实却被你轻轻滑过。……”
    厂长突然吃惊地叫道：
    “这不是我的检讨！
    不，也许是我的秘书……
    把…把这…这件事搞错了！”
    书记讥讽地笑了一笑：
  “那么这是谁的检讨？
    你的图章盖在上边，
    难道还会有人假冒！”
    厂长轻轻把报告书拿起，
    颤声地向书记请示：
  “让我回去查一查，
    这当中一定有问题。”
    书记的语气格外沉重：
  “共产党员对党必须忠诚！
    你可以回去进一步地反省，
    反正这次一定要把你的错误查清。”
    书记的话还没落音，
    厂长就转身向外飞奔。
    他一口气跑回工厂，
    猛地推开秘书室的房门。
    秘书已经站在他的跟前，
    他却破着嗓子厉声叫喊：
    “这是谁做的检讨？
    是谁把我的图章盖在上边？”
    “是……是我代你做的检讨，
    是我把你的图章盖在上边。……”
    秘书的话还没有说完，
    他一巴掌把桌上的茶壶拍翻。
    “你这简直是胡闹，
    怎么可以随随便便写检讨？
    你还想不想干下去？
    我马上把你的职位革掉！” 
    秘书的话充满了委曲：
   “这检讨是你叫我写的，
    写完后也曾送交给你，
    你没有看就随手发了出去。”
    厂长久久没有言语，
    随后才轻声地把秘书申斥：
   “这也还是你的错误呀，
    谁叫你写得不能叫上级满意！”
    “好，过去的事让它过去，
    我要看看你这一次。
    这次一定要写得深刻，
    少戴帽子，多举事实！”
