Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 6th: As the United States intensifies its efforts to organize the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, thereby threatening the security of Asian countries, the calls from Indonesian politicians, parties, groups, and the broad masses for independently withdrawing from the Netherlands-Indonesia Union and immediately recovering West Irian are growing louder.

In a statement issued on May 26th, Aidit, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Indonesia, pointed out that the Netherlands, utilizing its federal relationship with Indonesia, occupies an important position in various Western political blocs. Now, it intends to use its control over West Irian to turn West Irian into a military base in order to join the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc that the United States is attempting to cobble together.

Talks by Dutch figures quoted in news from The Hague also confirm this point. The Dutch figures' talks indicate that Western countries want the Netherlands to participate in negotiations regarding the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, obviously due to the existing federal relationship with Indonesia.

Speaking of the importance of West Irian, the Dutch newspaper "Handelsblad" explained that West Irian's strategic significance has made the Netherlands and the United States very interested in it. Another Dutch newspaper bluntly exposed the United States' aggressive intentions, saying that if the United States wants to "liberate the Indonesian archipelago," a base in West Irian is necessary.

It is precisely this danger of aggression that has caused concern among people from all walks of life in Indonesia. Many public leaders, including leaders of the Communist Party of Indonesia, the Nationalist Party, the National People's Party, the Indonesian People's League, the Indonesian People's Youth League, the Indonesian Veterans Association, and other parties and groups, have recently issued public statements advocating independent withdrawal from the Netherlands-Indonesia Union and the recovery of West Irian.

In a statement issued on May 29th, the Indonesian General Labor Union said that taking firm measures to independently dissolve the Netherlands-Indonesia Union "is urgently necessary, mainly due to the political situation in Southeast Asia. In this region, American imperialists, with the assistance of its servant countries, are striving to drag Southeast Asian countries into the Southeast Asia Defense Treaty – a war-plotting bloc." The statement went on to say that Indonesia's remaining within the Netherlands-Indonesia Union means that Indonesia will be militarily tied to the Netherlands through military agreements, and Indonesia will be forced to assist and thus strengthen the belligerent bloc. The statement said that Indonesian air or naval bases will have to be supplied for the use of imperialist aircraft.

President Sukarno said in a recent speech that Indonesia's demand for the recovery of West Irian is based on security considerations. He said that as long as imperialism rules that place, the Republic will be threatened.

Foreign Minister Sunarjo said in a statement at the beginning of last month that the time has come to dissolve the Netherlands-Indonesia Union. He said that the Dutch occupation of West Irian not only means that the colonial system is still maintained in this part of Indonesian territory, but also makes people feel that it is a threat to Indonesia's security.

Lendunuwu, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Indonesian Parliament, told reporters on May 21st, accusing the Netherlands of adopting delaying tactics in resolving the Netherlands-Indonesia Union issue. He said that the Dutch attitude will ultimately only lead to Indonesia's independent withdrawal from the Netherlands-Indonesia Union.

### 印尼广大公众发出一致的呼声  要求退出荷兰——印尼联邦和收回西伊里安

    印尼广大公众发出一致的呼声
    要求退出荷兰——印尼联邦和收回西伊里安
    据新华社雅加达六日电：在美国加紧组织东南亚侵略集团因而威胁着亚洲各国安全的情况下，印尼政界人士、各党派团体和广大群众要求自行退出荷兰—印尼联邦和立即收回西伊里安的呼声日益高涨。
    印尼共产党总书记艾地在五月二十六日发表的声明中就曾经指出：荷兰利用和印尼的联邦关系在西方各种政治集团里占据重要的地位，现在又要利用它对于西伊里安的控制而把西伊里安变成军事基地，以便加入美国企图拼凑的东南亚侵略集团。
    报纸所载海牙消息中引用的荷兰人士的谈话也证实了这点。荷兰人士的谈话表明，西方国家想让荷兰参加关于东南亚侵略集团的谈判，显然是由于目前存在的和印尼的联邦关系。
    谈到西伊里安的重要性时，荷兰报纸“世界商报”解释说，西伊里安的战略意义使荷兰和美国对它发生了很大的兴趣。另一家荷兰报纸赤裸裸地暴露了美国的侵略意图说，假如美国想要“解放印尼群岛”的话，西伊里安的基地是必要的。
    正是这种侵略的危险，引起了印尼各界人士的忧虑。许多公众领袖，包括印尼共产党、国民党、国家人民党、印尼人民同盟、印尼人民青年团、印尼退伍军人协会以及其它政党和团体的领袖在内，最近都发表了公开的声明，主张自行退出荷兰—印尼联邦和收回西伊里安。
    印尼总工会在五月二十九日发表的声明中说，采取坚决措施以自行解散荷兰—印尼联邦“之所以有迫切的必要性，主要是由于东南亚的政治形势。在这个地区中，美帝国主义者在它的仆从国的协助下，正竭力把东南亚国家拉入东南亚防御公约——一个策划战争的集团”。声明接着说，印尼保留在荷兰—印尼联邦以内，就意味着印尼将被军事协定把它和荷兰联在一起，印尼将被迫协助并从而加强好战集团。声明说，印尼的空军基地或海军基地将不得不供给帝国主义者的飞机使用。
    苏加诺总统在最近的演说中说，印尼要求收回西伊里安，是从安全出发的。他说，只要帝国主义还统治着那个地方，共和国就会受到威胁。
    外交部长苏纳约在上月初的声明中说，现在，解散荷兰—印尼联邦的时候已经到了。他说，荷兰占领西伊里安不仅意味着在印尼的这部分领土上还维持着殖民制度，而且还使人觉得是对印尼的安全的威胁。
    印尼国会外交小组委员会主席伦度诺乌五月二十一日在向报界发表谈话时，指责荷兰在解决荷兰—印尼联邦问题上采取拖延伎俩。他说，荷兰的态度最后只会导致印尼自行退出荷兰—印尼联邦。
