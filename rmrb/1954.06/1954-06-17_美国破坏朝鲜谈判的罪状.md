    American Crimes in Sabotaging Korean Negotiations
    By Our Correspondents Li Zhuang and Du Bo
    Despite the greatest and final efforts by the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the discussion on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference was finally and completely sabotaged today (the 15th) by the Western countries under the manipulation of the United States. The United States cannot escape the responsibility for destroying the Geneva Conference.

    Today, the Korean section of the Geneva Conference held its last and longest meeting, at which the delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union successively put forward four proposals, all of which were rejected rashly by the United States and some of its followers.

    Foreign Minister Nam Il first presented a six-point proposal at today's meeting on guaranteeing a peaceful state in Korea. This proposal received the full support of Foreign Minister Molotov and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai also suggested holding a restricted seven-nation conference including the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and North and South Korea to specifically study measures to guarantee peace in Korea based on Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal.

    The delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union believed that although the conference could not reach an agreement on the peaceful unification of Korea for the time being, it should reach an agreement on consolidating peace in Korea. Although the Korean War has ceased, the state of armistice is ultimately not a consolidated peace, and the armistice in Korea has been seriously threatened due to the constant clamoring for "northward advance" by the US-backed Syngman Rhee and his large-scale military buildup. Therefore, reaching an agreement on consolidating peace in Korea first is clearly in line with the wishes of peace-loving people around the world.

    In view of the fact that this proposal to guarantee peace in Korea was unreasonably rejected, Foreign Minister Molotov proposed that the conference adopt a declaration on Korea, in which the participating countries of the Geneva Conference would guarantee that "pending the final settlement of the Korean issue on the basis of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic state, no action shall be taken that may constitute a threat to the maintenance of peace in Korea." Faced with this proposal, which embodied the most basic demands of peace-loving people around the world for the Geneva Conference, the delegation of Western countries headed by the United States turned a blind eye and instead put forward a pre-planned "Sixteen-Nation Joint Declaration" concocted by the United States, announcing the complete breakdown of the conference on the Korean issue.

    In order to preserve a glimmer of hope for a conference on continuing to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai put forward a final proposal, hoping that the states participating in the Geneva Conference would "continue to work toward reaching an agreement on a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue on the basis of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic Korean state. The time and place for resuming appropriate negotiations shall be agreed upon separately by the states concerned." Foreign Minister Zhou's proposal opened the door to continued discussion of a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. Foreign Minister Zhou's proposal was supported by Belgian representative Spaak. This proposal had such powerful moral force that no one in the Western camp dared to openly oppose it at the time. However, when the chairman of the conference, United Kingdom representative Eden, was about to announce that the conference had adopted this proposal and asked if there were any objections, US representative Smith hurriedly requested to speak to express his opposition. Although some Western countries' representatives expressed their acceptance of the proposal on the spot, US representative Smith rejected Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal, thus finally blocking the door to further discussion of a peaceful solution to the Korean issue.

    For the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the easing of the situation in the Far East and the world, the delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union made every effort in the discussion of the Korean issue.

    On April 27, the second day of the opening of the Geneva Conference, Foreign Minister Nam Il put forward a constructive plan on "restoring the national unity of Korea and holding free all-Korean elections," advocating that representatives from North and South Korea form an all-Korean committee to hold truly democratic elections under completely free conditions with all foreign troops withdrawn from Korea within six months and without any foreign interference to achieve the unification of Korea; and that all relevant countries should guarantee the peaceful development of Korea. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Molotov fully supported this proposal by Foreign Minister Nam Il. On May 3, Foreign Minister Nam Il stated that the time limit for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea could be further negotiated.

    On May 22, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, in view of the fact that many countries' representatives at the meeting emphasized the need for international supervision of the all-Korean elections, suggested that a neutral country that had not participated in the Korean War should form an international supervisory committee to assist the all-Korean committee in conducting elections and supervise them.

    On June 5, Foreign Minister Molotov, in order to promote the progress of the conference, summarized the opinions that the representatives of the participating countries had reached agreement and near agreement on over the past month and put forward five principles, advocating that agreements be reached on the issues on which agreement had been reached and that consultations should continue on the various differences. At the same time, Foreign Minister Nam Il proposed that foreign troops could be withdrawn from Korea proportionally and that the date of withdrawal could be specifically discussed.

    When US representative Smith made a threatening statement on June 5 that he would appeal to world opinion on the Korean issue, Korea, China, and the Soviet Union still made significant efforts at the 15th meeting today (June 15) and put forward specific proposals, fully demonstrating the sincere desire of the three countries' delegations to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue.

    However, the countries that invaded Korea, headed by the United States, have been unreasonably opposing the constructive proposals of the three countries, Korea, China, and the Soviet Union for more than a month during the discussion of the Korean issue, but at the same time, they did not put forward any specific countermeasures. Reuters reported on May 17 and 20 that "North Korea's plan is the only clear plan put forward at the meeting," and many Western representatives "felt worried" and "generally concerned about the next Korean meeting to propose a new plan on Korea that 'seems reasonable in the eyes of world opinion'."

    For this purpose, after the discussion of the Korean issue had been going on for nearly a month, the South Korean representative put forward a so-called proposal on May 22. However, this "proposal" was so absurd that many delegations of the sixteen countries that invaded Korea also believed that this "proposal" could not represent their opinions. The United States, which represented the sixteen countries in signing the Korean Armistice Agreement, played the role in the meeting of opposing any agreement from being reached.

    At the third plenary session on April 28, Dulles brought out the illegal resolution of the UN General Assembly of October 7, 1950, and wanted the Syngman Rhee dictatorial regime, with the help of the United States, to unify Korea. However, this was something that the US military could not achieve in the three-year war of aggression against Korea. Dulles brought this illegal resolution to the Geneva Conference, which shows that he was trying to block the path to a peaceful solution to the Korean issue from the very beginning of the discussion. The "declaration" of the sixteen countries destroying the discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference similarly proposed that the Korean issue be handed over to the United Nations for handling, proving that it was only a replica of Dulles' speech on April 28. The United States has been using the United Nations as a tool to sabotage the conference from the beginning to the end of the discussion of the Korean issue. What qualifications does the "United Nations" organization, which has been reduced to one of the belligerent parties, have to deal with the Korean issue? The United States' insistence on bringing the United Nations out to deal with the Korean issue only proves that it wants to keep the Korean issue unresolved forever in order to maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice and create a tense situation.

    It is well known that the United States has been trying to sabotage the discussion of the Korean issue during the Geneva Conference. The US "New York Times" said on May 9: "US officials claim that if the Communists do not agree to hold elections in North Korea under the supervision of the United Nations, the US delegation is prepared to suspend negotiations with the Communists on the Korean issue," but "some small countries doubt whether this is the best reason to suspend negotiations on the Korean issue." The Associated Press said on May 21 that "Western diplomats have decided that the Korean issue has hopelessly run aground, and they are still holding talks, mainly hoping to put themselves in a more advantageous position in propaganda," and "the United States is trying to shift the responsibility to the Communists." Because, according to the "New York Times" on May 28, "the United States has fallen behind in the competition on the Korean issue, and the Communists have put forward a proposal that seems to be a reasonable and fair plan to reunite Korea in the eyes of neutral Asians."

    According to Reuters and the "New York Times," the United States originally intended to "formally adopt the strategic measure of 'suspending negotiations' on May 26 by resolutely supporting the South Korean plan of May 22," but the US attempt failed because the South Korean plan was opposed by some Western countries' representatives. After that, according to the London "Daily Telegraph" on June 7, "the US and South Korean delegations are trying to find a way to sabotage the negotiations under a decent excuse." The United States once again resolved to break off the Korean talks on June 5, "but Molotov made a new proposal again." According to the "New York Times," this greatly deteriorated "the UN's position on stopping negotiations." According to Reuters, by June 11, "the sixteen countries on the UN side still had small differences on the common policy of breaking off negotiations," so the United States failed to immediately break off negotiations at the 14th plenary session on the Korean issue that day.

    The United States' determination to bury the discussion of the Korean issue at the 15th plenary session on June 15 was carefully arranged in advance. On June 14 and the morning of June 15, the sixteen countries that invaded Korea held consecutive meetings and prepared a "common declaration" in advance, arbitrarily declaring the discussion of the Korean issue "failed." In this way, although Smith was embarrassed at the meeting on the 15th, he could not care about it.

    From the above facts, people all over the world can see that there are two different attitudes and two different positions in the discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union wanted to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and strive to ease the tense world situation, and put forward various proposals for solving the problem; while the countries that invaded Korea, headed by the United States, refused to negotiate, refused to continue discussions, and were unwilling to put forward proposals, finally causing the discussion of the Korean issue to end without results.

    Originally, since the announcement of the decision of the Berlin Conference to convene the Geneva Conference, the Soviet Union, China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and peace-loving people all over the world have repeatedly expressed their fervent hope for the success of the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, thereby further easing international tensions. However, the authorities in the United States have taken completely opposite views and plans.

    At a press conference on April 7, US President Eisenhower openly said that he "did not believe that there was a good chance of reaching a negotiated solution in Geneva." On April 16, in an off-the-record conversation with hundreds of American newspaper editors, US Vice President Nixon predicted that the Korean issue would "end in a stalemate" at the Geneva Conference. In a statement on March 29, US Secretary of State Dulles proposed that the unification of Korea should be achieved by the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers, that is, Syngman Rhee must be allowed to occupy the whole of Korea with the support of the US invading army. According to a message carried in the Paris "Nation Forum" on March 5, US Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Robertson said at a private banquet entertaining confidant reporters: "Peace in Korea will have serious consequences for the United States. It will cause pressure to allow China to enter the United Nations, disintegrate the ANZUS Treaty, and lead to increased pressure in Japan to demand that the United States abandon its military bases." It was this situation that led the British magazine "New Statesman and Nation" of April 24 to make this appropriate description: "In any case, Mr. Dulles went to Geneva on Monday with a determination: first, he was unwilling to open this meeting; since he is now forced to participate, he will pretend to negotiate—to such an extent that he can convince America's allies of the 'futility' of the negotiations (in Nixon's words) and allow him to declare that the last effort to deal with the Communists has been exhausted before the new Asian alliance begins its 'joint action'." Understanding the background of the US imperialists' deliberate obstruction and sabotage of a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, it is not surprising that the United States brazenly terminated the Korean issue talks with the absurd declaration of the sixteen countries after more than a month of painstaking efforts by Korea, China, and the Soviet Union to seek consultation.

    Yes, the discussions on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference failed to meet the expectations of peace-loving people all over the world due to the destruction of the United States, and history will forever record this crime of the United States against the will of people all over the world. Of course, as the delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union stated at today's meeting, they and peace-loving people all over the world will continue to stand unyieldingly on the side of the Korean people and fight for the national independence, freedom, democracy, and unification of Korea. Observers here point out that although the Korean issue consultations over the past month have not been successful, they have still yielded gains, that is, in the face of world opinion, US imperialism has further revealed its nature of not wanting peace and fearing peace.

    美国破坏朝鲜谈判的罪状
    本报记者　李庄  杜波
    虽然，苏联、中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国方面尽了最大和最后的努力，日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论，终于今天（十五日）在美国操纵下为西方国家彻底破坏了。美国绝不能逃脱破坏日内瓦会议的责任。
    今天日内瓦会议朝鲜部分举行了最后的也是最长的一次会议，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中国、苏联代表团在会上连续提出四项建议，都被美国和它的一些追随者轻率地拒绝了。
    南日外务相在今天的会议上首先提出了关于保证朝鲜的和平状态的六点建议，这个建议得到莫洛托夫外长和周恩来外长全力的支持。周恩来外长并建议举行包括苏联、中国、英国、美国、法国和南北朝鲜的七国限制性会议，以南日外务相建议为基础，具体研究保证朝鲜和平的措施。
    朝、中、苏代表团认为会议一时虽然不能对和平统一朝鲜的问题达成协议，但是应该对巩固朝鲜和平的问题达成协议。因为朝鲜战争虽然停止了，但停战的状态究竟不是巩固的和平，而且由于美国支持的李承晚不断叫嚣“北进”，并大肆备战扩兵，已使朝鲜停战受到严重的威胁。因此，首先就巩固朝鲜和平的问题达成协议，显然是符合爱好和平的世界人民的愿望的。
    鉴于这一保证朝鲜和平的建议又被无理拒绝，莫洛托夫外长又建议会议通过一项关于朝鲜的宣言，由参加日内瓦会议各国保证“在等待朝鲜问题在建立一个统一、独立、民主国家的基础上最后解决期间，不得采取任何可能足以对维持朝鲜和平构成威胁的行动。”面对着这个体现全世界爱好和平人民对日内瓦会议最起码的要求的建议，以美国为首的西方国家代表团却视若罔闻，反而提出美国策划的准备已久的“十六国共同宣言”，宣布完全破裂关于朝鲜问题的会议。
    为了保存关于继续寻求和平解决朝鲜问题的会议的一线生机，周恩来外长提出最后的建议，希望日内瓦会议与会国家“继续努力以期在建立统一、独立和民主的朝鲜国家的基础上达成和平解决朝鲜问题的协议。关于恢复适当谈判的时间和地点问题，将由有关国家另行商定”。周外长的建议给继续和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论打开门路。周外长的建议获得了比利时代表斯巴克的支持。这一建议具有如此强大的道义力量，以致当时西方阵营中没有一个人敢于出来公开反对它。但当会议主席、联合王国代表艾登准备宣布大会通过这一建议，询问有无反对时，美国代表史密斯才慌忙地要求发言表示反对。虽然有些西方国家的代表当场表示可以接受这个建议，而美国代表史密斯拒绝周恩来外长的建议，这样就最后地把继续讨论和平解决朝鲜问题的大门堵住了。
    为了和平解决朝鲜问题、缓和远东及世界局势，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中国和苏联代表团在朝鲜问题的讨论中竭尽了一切努力。
    四月二十七日，即日内瓦会议开幕的第二天，南日外务相就提出了一个“关于恢复朝鲜的国家统一和举行全朝鲜自由选举”的建设性方案，主张由南北朝鲜代表组成全朝鲜委员会，在一切外国军队于六个月内撤离朝鲜、没有任何外国干涉的完全自由的条件下举行真正民主的选举，以实现朝鲜的统一；而一切有关国家应保证朝鲜的和平发展。周恩来外长和莫洛托夫外长完全支持南日外务相的这个建议。五月三日，南日外务相表示对于外国军队从朝鲜撤退期限，可以继续协商考虑。
    五月二十二日，周恩来外长鉴于许多国家代表在会上强调对全朝鲜选举进行国际监察的必要，建议由没有参加朝鲜战争的中立国家组成国际监察委员会，协助全朝鲜委员会进行选举，并予以监察。
    六月五日，莫洛托夫外长为推动会议向前进展，总结了一个月来与会各国代表所已经取得一致和接近一致的意见，提出了五项原则建议，主张就已经取得一致的意见达成协议，对各项分歧继续协商解决。同时南日外务相提出外国军队可以按比例从朝鲜撤退，而撤退的日期可以进行具体磋商。
    当美国代表史密斯在六月五日提出要把朝鲜问题诉诸世界舆论的威胁性发言后，朝、中、苏在今天（六月十五日）的第十五次会议上，仍然作了重大的努力，提出了具体的方案，充分表现了三国代表团谋求朝鲜问题和平解决的真诚愿望。
    可是，以美国为首的侵朝国家，在讨论朝鲜问题一个多月的时间内，一直无理反对朝、中、苏三国的这些建设性建议，但同时又不提任何具体的对策。路透社五月十七日和二十日报道说：“北朝鲜的方案是在会议上提出的唯一明确的方案”，西方很多代表“感到忧虑”，“普遍关怀在下一次朝鲜会议上应该提出一个关于朝鲜的‘在世界舆论看来是合理的’新计划”。
    为了这个目的，在朝鲜问题的讨论进行了近一个月之后，南朝鲜代表才在五月二十二日提出了一个所谓建议，可是这个“建议”是如此荒谬，以致十六个侵朝国家中的许多代表团也认为这个“建议”不能代表他们的意见。代表十六国在朝鲜停战协定上签字的美国，在会议中所起的作用就是反对任何协议的达成。
    四月二十八日第三次全体会议上，杜勒斯搬出了联合国大会一九五○年十月七日的非法决议，要由李承晚专制政权在美国帮助下来统一朝鲜。然而这是美国军队在三年侵朝战争中所无法实现的，杜勒斯把这个非法决议搬到日内瓦会议上，说明他在讨论一开始就是企图堵死和平解决朝鲜问题的道路的。现在十六国破坏日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题讨论的“宣言”，同样提出朝鲜问题要交由联合国处理，证明它只是杜勒斯四月二十八日发言的翻版。美国从朝鲜问题讨论的开始到结束，一直拿着联合国作为破坏会议的工具，而沦为交战国一方的“联合国”组织还有什么资格处理朝鲜问题呢？美国硬要把联合国搬出来处理朝鲜问题，只是证明它是要使朝鲜问题永远得不到解决，以保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，制造紧张局势。
    美国在日内瓦会议期间一直要破坏朝鲜问题的讨论是路人皆知的。五月九日的美国“纽约时报”说：“美国人士宣称：假如共产党人不同意在联合国的监督下在北朝鲜进行选举，则美国代表团准备中止与共产党人关于朝鲜问题的谈判”，但“某一些小国家怀疑这是否是中止朝鲜问题谈判的一个最好的理由”。美联社五月二十一日说：“西方外交家们已决定朝鲜问题是毫无希望地搁浅了，他们仍然进行会谈，主要是希望在宣传使自己处于更有利的地位”，“美国企图把责任推到共产党人身上”。因为，据“纽约时报”五月二十八日说：“美国在朝鲜问题上的角逐中已经陷入劣势，共产党已经提出建议，这个建议在中立的亚洲人看来似乎是一个重新统一朝鲜的合理公平的方案”。
    据路透社和“纽约时报”透露，美国原来打算“以坚决支持五月二十二日南朝鲜计划的方式，正式采取在五月二十六日‘中止谈判的战略措施’”，可是由于南朝鲜的计划遭到一些西方国家代表的反对，美国的企图没有能够实现。之后，据伦敦“每日电讯报”六月七日说：“美国和南朝鲜代表团在尽力寻找一种方式，以便借助于这种方式，来在冠冕的借口下破坏谈判。”美国再一次下决心要在六月五日使朝鲜谈判破裂，“可是莫洛托夫又提出了新建议。”据“纽约时报”说，这使得“联合国方面停止谈判的立场大大恶化了”。据路透社报道：到六月十一日，“联合国方面十六国对破裂谈判的共同政策还有小的分歧”，因此那天的朝鲜问题第十四次全体会议上，美国未能立即使谈判破裂。
    美国下定决心要在六月十五日第十五次全体会议上葬送朝鲜问题的讨论，事先是经过了周密布置的。六月十四日和十五日上午，侵朝十六国连续举行了会议，事先准备好了“共同宣言”，武断地宣布朝鲜问题的讨论“失败”。这样，虽然史密斯在十五日的大会上弄得狼狈周章，也就顾不得了。
    从以上的事实，全世界人民都可以看到，在日内瓦会议的朝鲜问题讨论中有着两种不同的态度，两种不同的立场。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联，是要和平解决朝鲜问题的，是争取和缓世界紧张局势的，提出了解决问题的各种建议；而以美国为首的侵略朝鲜的国家，则是拒绝协商，拒绝继续讨论，不愿意提出建议，终于使朝鲜问题的讨论无结果而散。
    本来从柏林会议关于召开日内瓦会议的决议公布后，苏联、中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和全世界爱好和平的人民，都一再表示热烈希望和平解决朝鲜问题的成功，从而进一步缓和国际的紧张局势。但是，美国的当权者们却作了完全相反的看法和打算。
    在四月七日的记者招待会上，美国总统艾森豪威尔就公开说，他“不相信在日内瓦有达成协商解决的好机会”。四月十六日，在和数百名美国报刊编辑的不许记录的谈话中，美国副总统尼克松预定朝鲜问题将在日内瓦会议上“以僵局而结束”。在三月二十九日的一个声明中，美国国务卿杜勒斯提出朝鲜的统一要由中国人民志愿军的撤退而达成，这就是说，必须让李承晚在美国侵略军支持下占据全朝鲜。而据三月五日巴黎“民族论坛”报所载消息，美国远东事务助理国务卿罗伯逊在一次招待亲信记者的私人宴会上说：“在朝鲜的和平，将对美国有严重的后果，它将引起使中国进入联合国的压力，瓦解美澳新公约，并将导致在日本要求美国放弃其军事基地的压力的增加。”就是这种情况，使得四月二十四日的英国“新政治家与民族”杂志作出了这样恰切的描绘：“不管怎样，杜勒斯先生星期一去日内瓦是下定了决心的：首先他就不愿意开这个会议，既然他现在被迫参加了，他将假装着谈判——装到这样的程度，以便使美国的同盟者相信谈判的‘徒劳无功’（用尼克松的话语），并使他可以声明在新的亚洲联盟开始它的‘联合行动’之前，和共产党打交道的最后努力已经尽到了。”了解了美帝国主义者这种蓄意阻挠破坏朝鲜问题和平解决的背景，那么在朝、中、苏方面月余来苦口婆心的谋求协商之后，美国竟仍悍然借十六国的荒谬宣言的方式来终止朝鲜问题的会谈，就没有什么奇怪了。
    是的，日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的商谈已因美国的破坏而未能达到全世界爱好和平人民的期望，历史将永远记载着美国这一违背全世界人民意志的罪行。当然，正如朝、中、苏代表团在今日的会议上所表示的，它们和全世界爱好和平的人民将继续不屈不挠地站在朝鲜人民方面，为实现朝鲜的民族独立、自由、民主、统一而奋斗。这里的观察家们指出：月余来的朝鲜问题商谈，虽未达于成功，但仍是有其收获的，这就是在全世界舆论面前，美帝国主义者更进一步显露了它不要和平、害怕和平的本质。　六月十五日
