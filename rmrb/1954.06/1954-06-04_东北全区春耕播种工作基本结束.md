The spring planting work in the entire Northeast region has basically concluded. The vast majority of the region's more than 17,000 agricultural production cooperatives took the lead in planting according to national needs in a planned manner. Agricultural production cooperatives in cotton-producing areas such as western Liaoning, eastern Liaoning, and Rehe provinces have increased cotton planting based on the conditions of their respective cooperatives. For example, the 130 agricultural production cooperatives in the sixth district of Yixian County increased the area planted with crops such as cotton, soybeans, and peanuts by 32.4 percent compared to last year, accounting for 52 percent of the total cultivated land of these cooperatives. Driven by the agricultural production cooperatives, the sixth district of Yixian County overfulfilled the cotton planting plan, and farmers throughout the area will produce seven million catties of seed cotton for the country this year. Farmers in Songjiang Province actively responded to the government's call and planted 753,000 hectares of oil crops such as soybeans, sunflowers, flax, and castor beans. More than 10,000 hectares of flax planted by farmers in Jilin Province have all emerged, with robust and uniform seedlings. The planting area of fine grains has also been expanded compared to last year. Liaodong Province originally planned to expand the paddy field area by 2,800 hectares this year, and it has now reached 4,000 hectares; Songjiang Province planned to expand by 7,000 hectares, and the actual area of newly opened paddy fields has now exceeded 13,000 hectares, exceeding the plan by nearly double. The total grain planting area in the entire region has also increased compared to last year, with the area of reclaimed wasteland and newly cultivated land in Songjiang Province reaching nearly 90,000 hectares. In order to ensure increased crop production, farmers in various regions have summarized their past experience in increasing production and actively improved farming techniques. This year's spring plowing, land preparation, and planting techniques have been greatly improved compared to last year. In the past, farmers in Qian'an, Dehui, Huaide, Jiutai, Yushu, and other counties in Jilin Province rarely cleared the previous year's crop stubble left in the fields. This year, the vast majority of farmers have dug up the stubble in the fields and raked it out of the fields. According to statistics from Hailun and 21 other counties in Heilongjiang Province, more than 383,000 hectares of soybeans, millet, broomcorn millet, and corn have achieved rational close planting, accounting for 20.8 percent of the total sown area. At present, farmers in various regions are busy weeding, cultivating, protecting seedlings, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests in the fields. In many counties in the southern regions, about one-half of the first weeding has been completed.

    东北全区春耕播种工作基本结束
    东北全区的春耕播种工作已经基本结束。全区的一万七千多个农业生产合作社绝大多数都带头按照国家需要有计划地进行了播种。辽西、辽东、热河等省产棉区的农业生产合作社都根据本社条件增植了棉花。如义县六区的一百三十个农业生产合作社种植棉花、大豆、花生等作物的面积较去年增加了百分之三十二点四，占这些社总耕地面积的百分之五十二。在农业生产合作社的带动下，义县六区超额完成了植棉计划，全区农民今年将为国家生产七百万斤籽棉。松江省农民积极响应政府号召，播种大豆、向日葵、大麻、蓖麻等油料作物达七十五万三千垧。吉林省农民播种的一万多垧亚麻已经全部出苗，幼苗茁壮整齐。细粮的种植面积也较去年扩大了，辽东省原计划今年扩大水田面积两千八百垧，现已达四千垧；松江省计划扩大七千垧，现在实开水田面积已突破一万三千垧，超过将近一倍。全区粮食播种总面积比去年也增加了，松江省恢复撩荒地和新开荒地的面积将近九万垧。为保证农田增产，各地农民都总结了以往的增产经验，积极改进耕作技术，今年的春耕整地和播种技术都比去年有很大的改进和提高。吉林省的乾安、德惠、怀德、九台、榆树等县农民过去很少清除前一年留在地里的庄稼楂子，今年绝大多数农民都把地里的楂子刨净并搂出地外。黑龙江省海伦等二十一个县统计，有三十八万三千多垧大豆、谷子、糜子、玉米做到合理密植，占已播大田总面积的百分之二十点八。目前，各地农民正忙着在田间除草、培土、保苗和防治病虫害。南部地区的许多县份，头遍除草已完成二分之一左右。
