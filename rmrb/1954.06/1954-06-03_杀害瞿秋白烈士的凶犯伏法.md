Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 2nd: The arch-criminals Xiang Xianju and Chen Ding, the principal culprits in the murder of Martyr Qu Qiubai in 1935, were executed by shooting in Changsha City on May 21st after detailed interrogation by the Hunan Provincial People's Court and approval from the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government.

\tXiang Xianju served as the Major General Chief of Staff of the Kuomintang bandit army's 36th Division in 1935, and Chen Ding was the Major Adjutant and Xiang's primary accomplice. At the time, the 36th Bandit Division was the main force of the bandit army attacking our Central Revolutionary Base. Xiang directly commanded the bandit army to brutally kill a large number of our revolutionary fighters and the people of the old revolutionary base areas. According to Xiang's confession, he murdered more than 100 leading cadres and Communist Party members of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in a single incident at Zhongshan Park in Changting, Fujian. After Martyr Qu Qiubai was captured in 1935, Xiang and Chen tried every means to investigate Qu Qiubai's revolutionary position and used various tortures during interrogation, but they never obtained any confession from Qu Qiubai. On June 18, 1935, these criminals murdered Qu Qiubai at Luohan Ridge outside the West Gate of Changting, Fujian.

\tBefore liberation, Xiang also served as a Major General Senior Staff Officer of the Kuomintang bandit army's "Sichuan-Hunan-Hubei Border Region Headquarters." After liberation, he hid in Changsha, Hunan, attempting to carry out sabotage activities. In July 1952, the Hunan Provincial Public Security Bureau arrested Xiang based on reports from the people. Chen led his bandit troops in stubborn resistance against the People's Liberation Army in Yunnan in 1949. After being defeated by the People's Liberation Army, he was captured and sent back to Hunan.

    杀害瞿秋白烈士的凶犯伏法
   【新华社长沙二日电】一九三五年杀害瞿秋白烈士的主犯向贤矩、陈定两首恶反革命分子，经湖南省人民法院详细审讯并呈报中央人民政府最高人民法院批准后，已于五月二十一日在长沙市枪决。
    向犯贤矩在一九三五年曾任国民党匪军第三十六师少将参谋长，陈犯定任少校副官，是向犯的主要帮凶。当时匪军三十六师是进攻我中央革命根据地的匪军主力。向犯曾直接指挥匪军残杀我大批革命战士和革命老根据地的人民。据向犯供认，在福建长汀中山公园一次就杀害中国工农红军领导干部和共产党员一百多人。一九三五年瞿秋白烈士被俘后，向、陈二犯曾多方设计侦察瞿秋白烈士的革命职务，在审讯中对瞿秋白烈士使用各种酷刑，但始终没有获得瞿秋白烈士任何口供。一九三五年六月十八日该犯等将瞿秋白烈士杀害于福建长汀西门外罗汉岭。
    向犯在解放前夕还曾充任国民党匪军“川湘鄂边区总司令部”少将高级参谋。解放后，又潜伏湖南长沙企图进行阴谋破坏活动，一九五二年七月湖南省公安机关根据人民群众的检举，将向犯逮捕。陈犯在一九四九年在云南率领匪部和人民解放军顽抗，被人民解放军击溃后捕获解返湖南。
