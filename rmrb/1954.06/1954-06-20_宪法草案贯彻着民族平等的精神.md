The Draft Constitution Embodies the Spirit of National Equality
Chairman of the People's Government of the Guizhou Western Autonomous Region of the Zhuang Nationality, Qin Yingji

    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the historical system of national oppression during the reactionary ruling era was fundamentally abolished. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, all ethnic groups in the country have united into a unified national family. In the past few years, we have implemented the policy of national regional autonomy in minority areas, and minority nationalities have gained the right to be masters of their own affairs, and political, economic, and cultural undertakings have developed rapidly. Every one of our minority peoples has deeply and personally experienced in their actual lives that it is inconceivable for minority nationalities to obtain the right to be masters of their own affairs without the leadership of the Communist Party.
    The draft constitution summarizes and affirms the achievements of past work, and further develops the experience gained in recent years, and clearly fixes it in the articles. For example, Article 3 of the General Program of the Draft Constitution stipulates that "The People's Republic of China is a unified multi-ethnic country" and "All ethnic groups are equal." The enshrining of this general principle and major premise in the soon-to-be-promulgated Constitution will further guarantee the equal rights of all ethnic groups and will be more conducive to consolidating and strengthening the unity of all ethnic groups. The draft constitution also stipulates that the self-government organs of ethnic autonomous areas, in addition to the functions and powers of general local state organs, may also exercise the power of self-government within the limits prescribed by the Constitution and laws. For example: manage local finances within the limits prescribed by law; organize local public security forces in accordance with the national military system; formulate autonomous regulations and separate regulations in accordance with the political, economic and cultural characteristics of the local ethnic group, and so on. As for places where it is not appropriate to establish autonomous regions and establish autonomous organs due to restrictions on regional population and other conditions, ethnic townships may be established, and in the autonomous organs of ethnic autonomous regions where multiple ethnic groups live together, relevant ethnic groups should have an appropriate number of representatives. The preface also emphasizes: "The state will take care of the needs of all ethnic groups in the process of economic construction and cultural construction, and will pay full attention to the characteristics of the development of all ethnic groups in the issue of socialist transformation." In short, all parts of the draft constitution embody the spirit of national equality, guaranteeing the equal rights of minority nationalities in political, economic, and cultural life, and ensuring that all minority nationalities in the country can develop their own political, economic, and cultural construction undertakings along with the construction of the motherland, advance from the ranks of backward nationalities to advanced nationalities, and gradually transition to socialist society. These regulations will surely be warmly supported by the people of all ethnic groups, and will greatly encourage the enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups to build a great motherland. I fully support the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China, and will widely carry out propaganda, study and discussion among the people of all ethnic groups in the entire autonomous region.

    宪法草案贯彻着民族平等的精神
    桂西僮族自治区人民政府主席　覃应机
    中华人民共和国成立以后，根本废除了反动统治时代的历史性的民族压迫制度。在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，全国各民族已经团结成为一个统一的民族大家庭。几年来，我们少数民族地区推行了民族区域自治政策，少数民族得到了当家作主的权利，政治、经济、文化事业得到了迅速的发展。我们每一个少数民族人民都深深地在实际生活中亲身体会到：如果没有共产党的领导，少数民族要想获得当家作主的权利是不可设想的。
    宪法草案总结和肯定了过去工作的成果，而且更进一步地发展了几年来所获得的经验，并用条文明确固定下来。如宪法草案总纲第三条规定：“中华人民共和国是统一的多民族的国家”，“各民族一律平等”。这个总原则和大前提在即将颁布的宪法中固定下来，这就进一步保证了各民族的平等权利，更有利于巩固和加强各民族的团结。宪法草案还规定民族自治地方的自治机关中除有一般地方国家机关的职权外，还可以按照宪法和法律规定的权限行使自治权。如：按照法律规定的权限管理本地方的财政；按照国家的军事制度组织本地方的公安部队；按照当地民族的政治、经济和文化的特点制定自治条例和单行条例等。至于因区域人口等条件的限制，不宜建立自治地方和设立自治机关的地方，可以成立民族乡，在多民族杂居的民族自治地方的自治机关中，有关民族都应当有适当名额的代表。序言中还着重指出：“国家在经济建设和文化建设的过程中将照顾各民族的需要，而在社会主义改造的问题上将充分注意各民族发展的特点。”总之，宪法草案的各个部分中都贯彻着民族平等的精神，保障了少数民族在政治、经济、文化生活上的平等权利，保证了全国各少数民族能够随着祖国的建设发展自己的政治，经济和文化建设事业，由落后民族提高到先进民族的行列，逐步过渡到社会主义社会。这些规定一定会得到各族人民的热烈拥护，并大大地鼓舞各族人民建设伟大祖国的积极性。我完全拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案，并将在全自治区各族人民中广泛展开宣传、学习和讨论。
