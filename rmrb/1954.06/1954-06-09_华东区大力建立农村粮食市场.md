East China Region Vigorously Establishes Rural Grain Markets

[This Report] East China's rural market towns are actively establishing state-managed grain markets. As of May 28th, the region had established 1,239 grain markets, nearly double the number in early May. Currently, the amount of grain entering each market daily or per market day is generally around 1,000 jin (500 kg), with markets in Dancheng and Nanbu in Xiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, having over 10,000 jin of grain on market days.

State-managed grain markets play a significant role in facilitating farmers' adjustment of grain supplies and invigorating the rural economy. The Menlou Township Grain Market in the Second District of Fushan County, Shandong Province, saw a total of 13,500 jin of grain enter the market over five market days, with over 200 farmer households purchasing grain at the market. After the establishment of the Lipu Town Grain Market in Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, the local supply and marketing cooperative's planned grain supply decreased by 45%.

In order to further establish state-managed grain markets in rural market towns, the East China Administrative Council's Financial and Economic Committee dispatched working groups to Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong provinces at the end of May to assist in expanding the establishment of grain markets.

    华东区大力建立农村粮食市场
    【本报讯】华东各地农村集镇积极建立国家管理的粮食市场。截至五月二十八日，全区已建立粮食市场一千二百三十九处，比五月上旬增加了近一倍。目前，每一市场每天或每集的粮食上市量，一般在一千斤左右，浙江省象山县丹城、南堡等市场每逢集日上市粮食还在一万斤以上。
    国家管理的粮食市场，对便利农民调剂粮食和活跃农村经济起了很大作用。山东省福山县第二区门楼乡粮食市场在五个集日中，共上市粮食一万三千五百多斤，有二百多户农民在市场上买到了粮食。浙江省金华县澧浦镇粮食市场成立以后，当地供销合作社粮食计划供应量减少了百分之四十五。
    为了进一步在农村集镇设立国家管理的粮食市场，华东行政委员会财政经济委员会已于五月底派出工作组，到安徽、江苏、山东三省协助开展增设粮食市场的工作。
