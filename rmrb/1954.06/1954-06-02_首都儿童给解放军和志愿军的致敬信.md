    A Letter of Respect from the Children of the Capital to the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army
    Dear uncles and aunts of the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army:
    Today is June 1st, our own festival, and everyone's heart is as happy as a blooming flower. We are all wearing our most beautiful clothes, and the Young Pioneers are wearing bright red scarves, to participate in the celebration and get-together that we have been preparing for a long time. We will perform all kinds of artistic programs.
    On this happy festival, while we are holding our celebration, we think that happiness and joy are due to the wise leadership of the Communist Party and our dearest leader Chairman Mao, and your heroic struggle. Dear uncles and aunts, on this joyous festival, we extend to you our most sincere gratitude and the most enthusiastic Young Pioneers salute!
    Dear uncles and aunts, we must study hard, exercise, and be ready at all times to participate in the construction of the motherland, and build our great motherland as beautiful as the Soviet Union.
    We wish you good health!
                          Capital Children's Celebration of "June 1st" International Children's Day
                                        June 1, 1954

    首都儿童给解放军和志愿军的致敬信亲爱的解放军和志愿军叔叔姑姑们：
    今天是六月一日，是我们自己的节日，我们每个人的心里像开了一朵鲜花一样高兴。我们都穿上自己最美丽的衣服，队员们都戴上了鲜红的红领巾，去参加我们准备好久的庆祝会、联欢会，我们要演出各种各样的文艺节目。
    在这快乐的节日里，在我们正在举行庆祝会的时候，我们想到幸福和快乐，都是由于共产党和我们最亲爱的领袖毛主席的英明领导和你们的英勇斗争得来的。亲爱的叔叔姑姑们：在这愉快的节日里，我们向您们致以最热忱的感谢，致以最热情的少先队敬礼！
    亲爱的叔叔姑姑们：我们一定要好好学习，锻炼身体，时刻准备着参加祖国建设，把我们伟大的祖国建设得像苏联那样美好。
    祝你们身体健康！
