The Communist Youth League (CYL) organization in the Beijing Soviet Exhibition Hall construction area, under the specific leadership of the Party committee and with the support of the administration and the trade union, organized youth shock brigades based on the suggestions of Soviet experts. These brigades broke through production quotas and promoted the labor emulation drive throughout the construction area, significantly increasing labor productivity. This successful experience vividly demonstrates that in the industrial, transportation, and capital construction sectors, strengthening the leadership of Party committees at all levels over the CYL and widely organizing young workers to participate in labor emulation drives using work methods suitable to the characteristics of youth is of great significance for completing and overfulfilling state plans and cultivating the young generation of the working class.

Currently, millions of young workers in our country are participating in production in factories and mines, nearly a million young people are involved in capital construction, and hundreds of thousands of young people are working in railway, transportation, and postal and telecommunications enterprises. According to materials from key surveys in 1953, young workers account for about 45 percent in factories and mines and about 50 percent in capital construction. According to statistics from the beginning of this year, there are a total of 800,000 CYL members in state-owned factories, mines, and capital construction departments alone. Undoubtedly, with the development of industrial construction, more young people will participate in the industrial front. The CYL organizations will develop further, and this is a powerful new force for building a socialist society in our country.

In recent years, with the strengthening of youth work by Party committees at all levels, the work of the CYL in industrial, transportation, and capital construction departments has improved daily. Especially since the beginning of planned economic construction in 1953 and after the convening of the Second National Congress of the CYL, the CYL organizations at all levels in enterprises have basically solved the problem of being oriented towards production. They have mobilized the vast number of young workers to participate in labor emulation drives. The vast number of young workers have demonstrated excellent qualities of loving labor, being diligent in learning, and daring to fight against conservative backwardness and bureaucratic phenomena in enterprises. Tens of thousands of labor models and advanced producers have emerged among young workers, greatly enhancing the power of labor emulation drives and promoting the improvement of labor productivity in enterprises.

However, not all cadres recognize the important significance of youth work. Some cadres neglect the positive role of young workers in production reform and technological innovation. They one-sidedly believe that "young workers play a role in democratic reform, but not in production reform," and "young workers cannot contribute to technological innovation," and do not pay attention to giving play to their creativity and enthusiasm, organizing them to study technology seriously, and promoting advanced experiences. Some CYL cadres do not go deep into understanding the problems in production and the demands of young workers, actively support their rationalization proposals, discover and summarize advanced production experiences, and help young workers solve difficult problems. Instead, they like to formulate some empty plans and issue some hollow calls. When these things do not achieve results, they feel that the work of the CYL is nothing more than cooperating everywhere, and it is meaningless. These one-sided understandings and practices that are divorced from reality have, to a certain extent, affected the education and cultivation of young workers and have not been able to fully give play to their positive role.

It must be reminded that caring for and cultivating the young generation of the working class is the collective undertaking of all members of the industrial, transportation, and capital construction departments. In the great revolutionary cause of building our country into a socialist society, especially realizing the country's socialist industrialization, the working class in our country bears an unshirkable and important task. Inheriting the revolutionary traditions and rich experiences of the working class in our country, crushing the sabotage of our industrial construction by the determined counter-revolutionaries among those classes that have been overthrown and will be eliminated, and capturing the new scientific and technological fortresses that we have never encountered before are the glorious tasks of the young generation of the Chinese working class. Young workers are proud to be the inheritors of the great revolutionary cause of the Chinese working class. They demand to grow up quickly politically and technically and to be worthy of replacing their predecessors. However, young workers have experienced less struggle and training after all. Many of them have just come from the countryside or schools and have not yet firmly established the collectivist ideology of the working class. Those hostile classes will never fail to take advantage of this weakness. They will try every possible means to use their ugly thoughts to corrupt young workers and use the ignorance of young workers in class struggle to harm our cause. In October 1953, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in its instructions to Party committees at all levels on strengthening the Party's leadership over the CYL, required the entire Party to work in accordance with the direction of "good health, good study, and good work" proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong. Therefore, the Party committees, Party members, and veteran workers in factories and mines must assume the responsibility of cultivating young workers into new people with high socialist consciousness and a high level of science and technology. Trade union organizations should consolidate the close cooperative relationship with the CYL and strengthen the work of cultivating and educating young workers. Every adult worker should unreservedly impart their skills to young workers and has the right to demand that young workers surpass their predecessors.

The CYL organizations in the industrial, transportation, and capital construction departments are the core through which the Party unites the vast number of young workers and a reliable assistant to the Party in cultivating the young generation of the working class. The CYL must be good at closely combining ideological education work with actual production struggles, and it must be good at organizing its activities around the central work of the Party and according to the characteristics of young workers. This requires the CYL to constantly improve and enhance its work, further implement the policy of being oriented towards production, be good at organizing activities suitable to the characteristics of young people in production, better unite the vast number of young people, and fully play the role of the Party's assistant.

The youth shock brigade in the Beijing Soviet Exhibition Hall construction area is a relatively good example of organizing young workers to complete the central work of the Party with work content and methods suitable to the characteristics of young people. It has enriched the work content of the CYL and improved the quality of the CYL's work. Organizing youth production teams, production groups, and youth shock brigades is the successful experience of the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League. Some enterprises, railways, factories, mines, and capital construction sites in our country have used this experience to organize some advanced youth production teams and production groups, and have achieved remarkable results. The example of the Beijing Soviet Exhibition Hall construction area further proves that organizing youth production teams, production groups, and youth shock brigades to take the lead in doing a good job in production is an effective method for educating young workers to establish a communist attitude towards labor, actively learning technology, consolidating labor discipline, and mobilizing and organizing them to participate in labor emulation drives. Therefore, it is also a concrete measure for cultivating the young generation of the working class and closely combining communist education with actual production struggles. The Party organizations in the various industrial, transportation, and capital construction departments should guide the CYL to study the spirit and essence of the work of the youth shock brigades, and, according to the needs and possibilities of production, focus on promoting the experience of youth production teams, production groups, and youth shock brigades, and more effectively give play to the positive role of young workers in national construction.

Of course, the Party and CYL organizations in all localities must clearly recognize that the establishment of youth production teams, production groups, and youth shock brigades is not the only work content and method of the CYL. CYL cadres must not expect to replace all the ideological and organizational work of the CYL with a certain work. The success of youth production teams, production groups, and youth shock brigades, as well as any other work, depends on the CYL organization doing a good job in regular ideological and organizational work, and depends on the Party committee's regular concern and guidance for the CYL's work.

### 发挥青年工人在国家建设中的积极作用

    发挥青年工人在国家建设中的积极作用
    北京市苏联展览馆工区的青年团组织，在党委的具体领导下，在行政和工会的支持下，根据苏联专家的建议，组织青年突击队，突破生产定额，推动全工区的劳动竞赛，显著地提高了劳动生产率。这一成功的经验，生动地说明了：在工业、交通运输和基本建设部门中，加强各级党委对青年团的领导，用适合青年特点的工作方法，广泛地组织青年工人参加劳动竞赛，对于完成和超额完成国家计划，培养工人阶级的青年一代，有着重大的意义。
    目前，我国有几百万青年工人参加工厂和矿山的生产，有近百万青年参加了基本建设，有几十万青年在铁路、交通运输和邮电企业中工作。据一九五三年重点调查的材料，在厂矿企业中青年工人占百分之四十五左右，在基本建设中青年工人占百分之五十左右。据今年年初的统计，仅国营厂矿企业和基本建设部门的青年团员共八十万人。无疑地，随着工业建设的发展，将有更多的青年参加到工业战线上来。青年团的组织将更加发展，这是我国建成社会主义社会的一支强大的生力军。
    几年来，随着各级党委对青年工作的加强，青年团在工业、交通运输和基本建设部门中的工作日有改进，特别是从一九五三年有计划的经济建设开始和青年团第二次全国代表大会召开以后，企业中各级青年团的组织基本上解决了面向生产的问题，发动了广大青年工人参加劳动竞赛，广大青年工人表现了热爱劳动、勤于学习、勇于向企业中的保守落后和官僚主义现象作斗争的优良品质，青年工人中涌现出数万名劳动模范和先进生产者，大大增强了劳动竞赛的威力，促进了企业中劳动生产率的提高。
    但是，并不是所有的干部都认识了青年工作的重要意义。有些干部忽视青年工人在生产改革和技术革新中的积极作用，他们片面地认为：“青年工人在民主改革中起作用，在生产改革中不起作用”，
  “技术革新中青年工人使不上劲”，而不注意发挥他们的创造性和积极性，组织他们认真地学习技术和推广先进经验。有一些青年团的干部，不去深入了解生产中的问题和青年工人们的要求，积极支持他们的合理化建议，发现和总结先进的生产经验，帮助青年工人解决困难问题，却喜欢订制一些空泛的计划，发出一些空洞的号召，而当这些东西收不到效果的时候，反觉得青年团的工作无非是到处配合，没有意义。这些片面认识和脱离实际的作法，都在一定程度上影响了对青年工人的教育和培养，不能够充分发挥他们的积极作用。
    必须提醒：关怀与培养工人阶级的青年一代，是各个工业、交通运输和基本建设部门的全体成员的集体事业。在把我们的国家建设成社会主义社会、特别是实现国家的社会主义工业化的伟大革命事业中，我国工人阶级担负着责无旁贷的重大任务。而继承我国工人阶级的革命传统和丰富经验，粉碎那些已经被打倒和将被消灭的阶级中的坚决反革命分子对我国工业建设的破坏，攻占我们过去未曾遇到的新的科学技术堡垒，这是中国工人阶级青年一代的光荣任务。青年工人以他们是伟大的中国工人阶级的革命事业的继承者而骄傲，他们要求在政治上、技术上迅速成长起来，不愧为他们的前辈的替班。可是，青年工人经历的斗争和锻炼毕竟是少的，他们有许多是刚从农村或学校里出来，还没有稳固地树立起工人阶级集体主义的思想。那些敌对阶级决不会不去利用这个弱点，他们会千方百计地以自己丑恶的思想来腐蚀青年工人，利用青年工人在阶级斗争中的无知来损害我们的事业。中共中央在一九五三年十月关于加强党对青年团的领导给各级党委的指示中，要求全党遵照毛泽东同志提出的“身体好、学习好、工作好”的方向来进行工作。因此，厂矿企业中党委、党员和老工人就必须担负起这样的责任，就是要把青年工人培养成有高度社会主义觉悟和高度科学技术水平的新人。工会组织应该巩固和青年团亲密合作的关系，加强培养、教育青年工人的工作。每一个成年工人应该毫无保留地把自己的技术传授给青年工人，并有权利要求青年工人超过他们的前辈。
    工业、交通运输和基本建设部门中的青年团组织，是党借以团结广大青年工人的核心，是党培养工人阶级青年一代的可靠助手。青年团要善于把思想教育工作和实际生产斗争紧密结合起来，要善于围绕着党的中心工作，根据青年工人的特点去组织自己的活动。这就需要青年团不断地改善和提高自己的工作，进一步贯彻面向生产的方针，善于在生产中去组织适合青年特点的活动，更好地团结广大青年群众，充分发挥党的助手作用。
    北京苏联展览馆工区的青年突击队，是以适合青年特点的工作内容和方法，组织青年工人完成党的中心工作的一个比较好的例子。它丰富了青年团的工作内容，提高了青年团的工作质量。组织青年生产班、生产组和青年突击队是苏联列宁共产主义青年团的成功经验。我国的某些企业、铁路、厂矿和基本建设工地曾运用过这个经验，组织过一些先进的青年生产班、生产组，取得显著成效。北京苏联展览馆工区的例子，更证明了组织青年生产班、生产组和青年突击队积极带头搞好生产，是教育青年工人树立共产主义的劳动态度、积极学习技术、巩固劳动纪律、发动和组织他们参加劳动竞赛的一个有效方法，因而也是培养工人阶级的青年一代，把共产主义教育和实际生产斗争密切结合起来的具体措施。各个工业、交通运输和基本建设部门党的组织，应该指导青年团研究青年突击队工作的精神和实质，根据生产的需要和可能，重点推行青年生产班、生产组及青年突击队的经验，更有效地发挥青年工人在国家建设中的积极作用。
    当然，各地党和青年团的组织都必须明确认识：建立青年生产班、生产组及青年突击队并不是青年团唯一的工作内容和方法，青年团的干部决不可企待着以某一项工作来代替青年团的全部思想工作和组织工作。青年生产班、生产组和青年突击队以及其他任何一项工作要得到成功，都有赖于青年团组织作好经常的思想工作和组织工作，有赖于党委对青年团工作经常的关怀和指导。
