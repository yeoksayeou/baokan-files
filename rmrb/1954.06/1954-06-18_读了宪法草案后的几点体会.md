Some Reflections After Reading the Draft Constitution
Xirao Jiacuo, Acting President of the Buddhist Association of China

The publication of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China is a great joyous event in the political life of the Chinese people. The Draft Constitution records the achievements of our people's revolution and national construction, and at the same time, it reflects the fundamental requirements of the country during the transition period and the common aspiration of the people to build a socialist society. Therefore, it is a fundamental law that conforms to the interests of the people of the whole country. I firmly believe that it will be enthusiastically supported by the people of the whole country.

We minority nationalities and people of all religious beliefs, including Buddhists, cherish and support this Draft Constitution. In the preface, general principles, state organs, and chapters on the basic rights and obligations of citizens, it takes into account the interests of all nationalities and religious beliefs, making people of all nationalities and religious beliefs more intimately feel the warmth and loveliness of the motherland's big family.

Of particular importance is the provision in the preface: "The state will take care of the needs of all nationalities in the process of economic and cultural construction, and will give full attention to the characteristics of the development of all nationalities in the issue of socialist transformation." This is in line with the practical interests of minority nationalities. Taking Qinghai Province as an example, the state first took care of the development of animal husbandry production in construction, and in terms of socialist transformation, it gave full attention to the characteristics of the development of minority nationalities. For example, the movement to increase production and practice economy only mentions increasing production and not practicing economy in Qinghai pastoral areas, because the people in Qinghai pastoral areas have always been poor, and increasing production is the most urgent task, which can be gladly accepted by the people and will not cause unnecessary concerns for some people. Now, the Draft Constitution explicitly stipulates this principle, which further points out the correct direction for future ethnic work. We will confidently do a better job in ethnic work under the guidance of this principle. We must resolutely overcome the remnants of local nationalism, thoroughly eliminate the conservative, xenophobic, and self-enclosed thinking and style that hinders the development of our own nation, and resolutely rely on the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.

Recalling the past period of reactionary rule, the Northern Warlords and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang also promulgated "constitutions," but that was entirely a deception. The reactionary ruling class often used the gilded signboard of "constitution" to oppress the people. I was a deceived person under the constitution-making fraud of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang at that time, and I deeply know its dirty and shameful nature from my own experience.

Brothers of all nationalities, friends of all religions, our motherland has achieved great development and progress under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. Now that we have the Draft Constitution, I firmly believe that it will achieve further development and progress in the future, enabling our people of all ethnic groups to gradually transition to a happy and prosperous socialist society. We must strive for a beautiful future of unlimited happiness and prosperity!

    读了宪法草案后的几点体会
    中国佛教协会代理会长　喜饶嘉错
    中华人民共和国宪法草案的公布，是中国人民政治生活中的一件大喜事。宪法草案记录了我国人民革命和建国以来的成果，同时它反映了国家在过渡时期的根本要求和人民建设社会主义社会的共同愿望。因此，它是符合全国人民利益的根本法。我深信它一定能获得全国人民的热诚拥护。
    我们少数民族人民和包括佛教徒在内的各宗教信仰者，珍视和拥护这一宪法草案，它在序言、总纲、国家机构和公民的基本权利和义务各章中，都照顾了各民族的利益和宗教信仰，使各民族人民各宗教信仰者更亲切地体会到祖国大家庭的温暖与可爱。
    特别重要的是，序言中规定了：“国家在经济建设和文化建设的过程中将照顾各民族的需要，而在社会主义改造的问题上将充分注意各民族发展的特点。”这是符合少数民族现实利益的。以青海省为例，国家在建设方面首先照顾了发展畜牧业生产，而在社会主义改造方面，更是充分注意了少数民族发展的特点，如增产节约运动，在青海牧业区只提增产而不提节约，因为青海牧区人民历来贫困，增加生产才是当务之急，能为人民所乐于接受，不致使某些人引起不必要的顾虑。现在，宪法草案中明确规定了这一原则，更给今后民族工作指出了正确的方针，我们将满怀信心地在这个方针指导下更进一步做好民族工作。我们必须坚决克服地方民族主义思想残余，彻底清除阻碍自己民族发展的保守排外与故步自封的思想和作风，坚决依靠毛主席和共产党的领导。
    回忆在过去反动统治时期，北洋军阀和蒋匪帮也曾公布过“宪法”，但是那完全是一种骗局，反动统治阶级往往假借“宪法”的金字招牌来压迫人民。我就是当时蒋匪帮制宪骗局下的被骗者，我从亲身的经历中深知其肮脏可耻。
    各民族的兄弟们，各宗教朋友们，我们的祖国在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下曾取得了大的发展与进步；现在有了宪法草案，我深信在今后将获得更进一步的发展与进步，使我们各族人民逐步过渡到幸福繁荣的社会主义社会。我们要为无限幸福繁荣的美好未来而奋斗！
