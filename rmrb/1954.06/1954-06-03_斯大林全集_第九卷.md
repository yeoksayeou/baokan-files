"The Complete Works of Stalin," Volume 9
He Kuang

Volume 9 of "The Complete Works of Stalin" includes Stalin's writings from December 1926 to July 1927.

During this period, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people were striving to realize the general policy of socialist industrialization of the country and began key construction projects. The socialist economy was increasingly strengthened and consolidated. In order to obstruct and undermine the Soviet Union's industrialization, the capitalist countries launched a series of offensives against the Soviet Union, such as Britain's announcement of the severance of diplomatic and commercial relations with the Soviet Union, etc. Coordinating with the offensive of the capitalist countries, the Trotskyist and Zinovievist elements, agents of capitalism, formed an anti-Party alliance, intensified anti-Party activities, undermined the Party's unity, undermined the prestige of the Party Central Committee, undermined the worker-peasant alliance, and attempted to restore capitalism in the Soviet Union.

The situation at that time, as Stalin pointed out, was that "something like a united front from Chamberlain to Trotsky" was being established to oppose the Soviet regime.

In view of the threat of war, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government strengthened their national defense forces, while adhering to a peaceful foreign policy, so that the conspiracies and provocations of the capitalist countries failed to succeed. In his report "Once Again on the Social-Democratic Deviation in Our Party" to the Seventh Enlarged Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, in the conclusion of this report, and in other works, Stalin exposed the destructive activities of the Trotsky and Zinoviev groups, smashed their anti-Party theories, defended the unity of the Party, and elucidated a series of theoretical and practical issues in Party building and socialist construction.

×××

Party unity is the life of the Party. Consolidating Party unity and strengthening the Party's leading role are the most fundamental conditions for building socialism. The enemies of the working class always try to find their own agents within the Communist Party to achieve the purpose of destroying the Party and undermining socialist construction. The Trotskyist and Zinovievist elements were precisely such bourgeois agents. Disregarding the Party's warnings and failing to implement the Party's resolutions, they intensified factional activities and carried out conspiracies to split the Party and usurp Party power. Stalin pointed out that the front of these anti-Party elements and anti-Party groups had in fact merged with the front of the enemies of the proletarian dictatorship.

The characteristics of these anti-Party elements' activities are to fabricate rumors and slander, distort right and wrong, slander Party leaders, damage the prestige of the Party Central Committee, distort Party history, and distort Marxist-Leninist theory; to adopt double-dealing tactics, feigning compliance while acting in opposition, verbally declaring adherence to Party discipline and implementing Party resolutions, while actually carrying out factional activities and implementing conspiracies to split the Party. Stalin pointed out that one of the most prominent characteristics of the anti-Party activities of all anti-Party factions after the Party seized power is to use the "leftist" and "revolutionary" mask to cover up their own opportunist behavior.

Stalin pointed out that only by waging a relentless struggle against this anti-Party tendency can the Party develop, the Party's unity be consolidated, and socialist construction be guaranteed. Stalin listed the historical facts of the development of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, proving that the Party "grows and consolidates through overcoming internal contradictions," that "overcoming differences of opinion within the Party through struggle is the law of development of our Party," and that "in a large party in a large country, development through overcoming contradictions is an indispensable factor for the Party's growth and consolidation." (Page 9)

Stalin further analyzed the roots of internal contradictions within the Party. The working class is not isolated from society; it is a part of society, and it has inextricable links with all strata of society. The Party is a part of the working class; therefore, the Party cannot sever its ties with all strata of society and escape their influence. In a class struggle environment, the most unstable strata of the working class and the most unstable elements of the working-class party are often eroded by the bourgeoisie and bourgeois ideology, and bourgeois viewpoints, styles, habits, and emotions penetrate into the working class and its party through them. Whenever the class struggle develops to a turning point, whenever the struggle intensifies and difficulties increase, the class struggle in society is more prominently reflected within the Party.

The anti-Party activities of the Trotskyist and Zinovievist elements also have their historical roots. They have consistently made errors of principle, persisted in their errors, and thereby formed factions, programs, and internal Party struggles. Stalin pointed out that no one is absolutely free from making mistakes, but there are two types of mistakes. One type of mistake is one that the perpetrator does not persist in and does not lead to the formation of a program or faction; such a mistake is quickly forgotten. The other type of mistake is one that the perpetrator persists in and thereby forms a faction, a program, and internal Party struggles; such a mistake cannot be quickly forgotten. The Party must expose and overcome the latter type of mistake, "because overcoming this type of mistake is the only means of establishing Marxist principles within the Party, maintaining Party unity, eliminating factional activities, and ensuring that this type of mistake is not repeated." (Pages 70-71)

It was precisely because the Communist Party of the Soviet Union timely and correctly overcame hostile activities and erroneous tendencies that endangered Party unity, consolidated Party unity, and strengthened the Party's leading role that it achieved the victory of the October Revolution, built socialism, and successfully transitioned from socialist society to communist society.

We are currently carrying out socialist transformation on a nationwide scale, which is a more profound and broader revolution than the revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, containing extremely complex and acute class struggles. This struggle is bound to be reflected within the Party. We must remember the historical lessons of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and our Party, enhance political vigilance in accordance with the spirit of the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC, prevent and overcome all behaviors that endanger Party unity, and cherish Party unity as we cherish our own lives and cherish our own eyes. Only in this way can we victoriously complete the general task of the transition period and build our country into a great socialist country.

Stalin argued for the theory of the possibility of building socialism in one country and for the Marxist-Leninist principle of the unity and indivisibility of the "national" tasks and international tasks of the working class. He used many historical facts to indicate that the Soviet working class was building socialism with the support of the working classes of all countries. He listed the various forms of alliance between the Soviet working class and the working classes of all countries. He pointed out that without these alliances and support, it would be unimaginable to build socialism in the Soviet Union. At the same time, the victory of the proletarian revolution in one country is not the ultimate goal, but an aid and means to promote the development and victory of revolutions in all countries. He pointed out that the victory of socialist construction in the Soviet Union will promote the revolutionary struggle of the working classes of all countries and give the working classes of all countries more opportunities to achieve victory.

The Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, completed the glorious mission of shock troops with a selfless spirit, powerfully assisted the revolutionary movements of the people of all countries, saved mankind from being enslaved by German and Japanese fascism, and continue to lead the peace, democracy, and socialism camp in striving to ease international tensions and maintain world peace.

History proves that the victory of the Chinese people's revolution is inseparable from the victory of the October Revolution, the victory of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, and the victory of the Soviet people in smashing German and Japanese fascism. The rapid recovery and development of our country's economy and the smooth implementation of the First Five-Year Plan would be unimaginable without the all-round and generous selfless assistance of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people. Consolidating and strengthening the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is a powerful bulwark for defending peace in the Far East and world peace and an important guarantee for successfully building our country into a socialist industrial power. We must learn from the Soviet Union's rich experience in socialist construction, learn from the Soviet people's spirit of hard work, learn from their patriotism and internationalism, give full play to all the potential forces of the people and the national economy, accelerate the process of national industrialization, and accelerate the process of socialist transformation, so that the peace, democracy, and socialism camp headed by the Soviet Union becomes more consolidated and powerful.

In Volume 9 of "The Complete Works of Stalin," the issue of the Party's peasant policy and the issue of the worker-peasant alliance occupy a prominent position. Stalin scientifically analyzed and argued for the Party's three basic slogans on the peasant issue, refuting the fallacies that distorted the Party's policy toward the peasants.

Stalin pointed out that the worker-peasant alliance and the leading role of the working class in this alliance are the guarantee for building socialism. We need the worker-peasant alliance "in order to educate and transform the peasants in a direction that conforms to the interests of the victory of socialist construction." (Page 166). However, how can we guarantee and strengthen the working class's leadership over the peasants? To achieve this, it is necessary to industrialize the country, to make socialist industry develop and consolidate, and to make the increasingly developed socialist industry lead agriculture forward. Therefore, every newly established factory is a new fortress of the working class, guaranteeing the working class's leadership over the vast masses of peasants.

Stalin gave a definition of the economic foundation of socialism, in which he also clarified the content and significance of the worker-peasant alliance during the period of socialist construction. He said: "To establish the economic foundation of socialism is to combine agriculture and socialist industry into a unified economy, to make agriculture subordinate to the leadership of socialist industry, to adjust the relationship between urban and rural areas on the basis of the exchange of agricultural products and industrial products, to block and eliminate all channels through which classes, especially capital, arise, and finally to create the production conditions and distribution conditions for the direct elimination of classes." (Pages 21-22)

It can be seen that the worker-peasant alliance needed during the period of socialist construction is not any kind of alliance, but a worker-peasant alliance with the goal of eliminating private ownership and eliminating classes, under the leadership of the working class and socialist industry, educating and transforming the vast number of peasants into socialist laborers, and transforming the individual and scattered peasant economy into a large-scale collective economy.

Stalin pointed out that there are no irreconcilable contradictions between the interests of the basic masses of the peasants and the interests of the working class. Their interests are fundamentally the same. It is impossible, as the opposition imagines, to achieve industrialization by harming the interests of the basic masses of the peasants, and thus embark on the road of treating the peasants as "colonies" and as "objects of exploitation." This can only disintegrate the worker-peasant alliance and undermine the foundation of industrialization. To truly maintain the worker-peasant alliance and continue to develop agriculture, it is necessary to implement a policy of continuously reducing the prices of industrial products. This is required by the common interests of workers and peasants, and this is also the basic line that industrial development must follow.

The Soviet people have built socialism relying on the worker-peasant alliance, and are now advancing toward the victory of communism relying on the continued consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance.

Stalin's exposition on the issue of the worker-peasant alliance during the period of socialist construction has particularly important practical significance for our country at present. In the general line for the transition period put forward by our Party, the important Marxist-Leninist principle of carrying out socialist construction by consolidating and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class is also embodied. Our country is advancing along the road of socialist industrialization, while actively and steadily developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, gradually completing the socialist transformation of agriculture, and is bound to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, strengthen the working class's leading role in this alliance, and complete the socialist transformation of the entire national economy.

In his speech at the Fifteenth Congress of the Moscow Province of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Stalin pointed out that in the Party's leadership of the country's socialist construction, having a correct line and correct policies is of course the most important thing. But if this policy is not implemented, or is distorted when implemented, then this policy is of no use. The fate of the worker-peasant alliance and the fate of socialist construction depend on the faithful implementation of correct policies. Therefore, to overcome the various difficulties in construction, correct policies alone are not enough. It is also necessary, as Lenin pointed out, to do a good job in correctly selecting personnel and organizing the inspection of implementation. "To lead construction, correct instructions alone are not enough. To lead construction, it is also necessary to place those who understand the meaning and role of these instructions, who can faithfully and honestly implement these instructions, and who regard the implementation of these instructions not as a meaningless routine but as a glorious undertaking, as their sacred duty to the Party and the proletariat, in the leading positions of our Soviet, economic, cooperative, and other construction work." (Page 142)

To ensure that the Party's correct line and correct policies can be implemented, it is also necessary to strive to improve the quality of the Party's leadership over the masses, so as to smoothly attract the vast number of workers and peasants to participate in socialist construction. The Party's leadership must not be formalistic leadership, not leadership on paper, not bureaucratic leadership, but practical leadership; the Party's leadership must have flexibility, "sensitivity, sensitivity, the highest degree of sensitivity to the demands of the masses." (Page 145)

Stalin pointed out that due to the victories achieved on the construction front and the increase in the awareness of the workers and peasants, the masses have higher requirements for leadership. We cannot adopt a bureaucratic and commandist attitude toward the workers and peasants. We must explain the instructions of the Party and the government to them "patiently and carefully, so that they understand what the Party is going to do and where it is going to lead the country. If they don't understand today, we will try to explain again tomorrow; if they don't understand tomorrow, we will try to explain again the day after tomorrow. If we don't do this now, there will be no and cannot be any leadership." (Page 144)

These instructions given by Stalin more than 20 years ago still have extremely important practical significance at present.

A large portion of Volume 9 is devoted to the issue of the Chinese revolution. In his works such as "The Question of the Chinese Revolution," "Some Questions Concerning the Chinese Revolution," "Conversation with Students of Sun Yat-sen University," "The Chinese Revolution and the Tasks of the Communist International," and "Brief Comments on Current Events," Comrade Stalin made a scientific analysis of the Chinese revolution, clearly pointed out the nature, motive force, and prospects of the Chinese revolution, and smashed the anti-Leninist line of the Trotskyist faction. He emphasized that the struggle between two roads is a characteristic of the Chinese revolution: "Either the national bourgeoisie defeats the proletariat, colludes with imperialism, and jointly attacks the revolution in order to establish capitalist rule and end the revolution; or the proletariat pushes the national bourgeoisie aside, consolidates its leadership, leads millions of working people in urban and rural areas to overcome the resistance of the national bourgeoisie, achieves the complete victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution, and then gradually transfers it to the track of the socialist revolution and obtains all the results arising therefrom." "The basic task of the Communists is to fight for the victory of the second road of the Chinese revolution." (Pages 199-200)

The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong correctly implemented these instructions of Stalin, led the Chinese people to achieve the great victory of the new democratic revolution, and is now continuing to consolidate the leadership of the working class, strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship based on the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class, and lead the people of the whole country to implement the First Five-Year Plan and complete the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

The writings of Stalin included in Volume 9 are rich and multifaceted. The vast number of readers in our country can draw strength from these writings, strengthen their confidence in the victory of socialist construction, and strive harder to complete the general task of the country in the transition period.

    “斯大林全集”第九卷
    何匡
    “斯大林全集”第九卷包括斯大林自一九二六年十二月至一九二七年七月的著作。
    这一时期，苏联共产党和苏联人民正为实现国家的社会主义工业化的总方针而奋斗，开始了有重点的基本建设。社会主义的经济日益加强和巩固。为了阻挠和破坏苏联的工业化事业，各资本主义国家对苏联展开了一系列的进攻，如英国宣布与苏联断绝外交关系和商务关系等等。配合资本主义国家的进攻，资本主义代理人托洛茨基分子和季诺维也夫分子结成了反党联盟，加紧反党活动，破坏党的团结和统一，破坏党中央的威信，破坏工农联盟，企图借此使资本主义在苏联复辟。
    当时的情况，正如斯大林指出的，“正在建立一种从张伯伦到托洛茨基的统一战线之类的东西”来反对苏维埃政权。
    苏联共产党和苏联政府鉴于战争的威胁，加强了自己的国防力量，同时坚持了和平的外交政策，使资本主义国家的阴谋和挑衅行为未能得逞。斯大林在向共产国际执行委员会第七次扩大全会所作的
  “再论我们党内的社会民主主义倾向”的报告中，在这个报告的结论中，以及在其他著作中，揭穿了托洛茨基和季诺维也夫集团的破坏活动，粉碎了他们的反党理论，维护了党的统一，并阐明了党的建设和社会主义建设中一系列的理论和实际问题。
                ×××
    党的团结是党的生命，巩固党的团结，加强党的领导作用，是建设社会主义的最根本的条件。工人阶级的敌人，总是力图在共产党内部寻找自己的代理人，来达到破坏党、破坏社会主义建设的目的。托洛茨基分子和季诺维也夫分子正是这样的资产阶级代理人，他们不顾党的警告，不执行党的决议，加紧进行派别活动，实行分裂党、篡夺党的阴谋。斯大林指出，这些反党分子和反党集团的战线实际上已和无产阶级专政的敌人的战线合而为一了。
    这些反党分子的活动的特点，是造谣诽谤，颠倒是非，污蔑党的领导者，损害党中央的威信，歪曲党的历史，歪曲马克思列宁主义理论；采用两面派手法，阳奉阴违，口头上声明遵守党的纪律，执行党的决议，实际上则进行派别活动，实行分裂党的阴谋。斯大林指出，一切反党派别，在党取得政权后，其反党活动的最显著的特征之一，就是用
  “左”的“革命的”假面具来掩盖自己的机会主义行为。
    斯大林指出，只有对这种反党倾向作无情的斗争，党才能发展，党的团结和统一才能巩固，社会主义的建设才有保证。斯大林列举了苏联共产党的发展的历史事实，证明党“是通过克服党内矛盾而成长和巩固起来的”，“以斗争来克服党内意见分歧是我们党的发展规律”，“在大国中的大党内，通过克服矛盾而发展，就是党成长和巩固所必不可少的因素。”（第九页）
    斯大林进一步分析了党内矛盾的根源。工人阶级不是与社会隔离的，它是社会的一部分，它和社会各阶层有千丝万缕的联系，而党是工人阶级的一部分，因此，党也是不能与社会各阶层断绝联系和摆脱它们的影响的。在阶级斗争环境中，工人阶级中最不坚定的阶层和工人阶级政党中最不坚定的分子往往要受到资产阶级和资产阶级思想的侵蚀，而资产阶级的观点、作风、习惯和情绪就通过他们而渗透到工人阶级及其政党中来。每当阶级斗争发展到转折点的时候，每当斗争尖锐化和困难加重的时候，社会的阶级斗争就更突出地反映到党内来了。
    托洛茨基分子和季诺维也夫分子的反党活动，也有其历史根源，他们一贯犯原则性的错误，一直坚持自己的错误，并由此而形成派别、政纲和党内斗争。斯大林指出，没有绝对不犯错误的人，但错误有两种，一种错误，犯者并不坚持，而且不致由此形成政纲和派别，这种错误很快就被忘却。另一种错误，犯者一直坚持，而且由此形成派别、政纲和党内斗争，这种错误就不能很快被忘却了。对后一种错误，党必须予以揭发和克服，“因为克服这类错误是在党内确立马克思主义原则、保持党内统一、消灭派别活动并保证不再重犯这类错误的唯一手段”。（第七○——七一页）
    苏联共产党正是及时而正确地克服了危害党内团结的敌对活动和错误倾向，巩固了党的统一，加强了党的领导作用，从而取得了十月革命的胜利，建成了社会主义，并胜利地从社会主义社会向共产主义社会过渡。
    目前我们正在全国范围内实行社会主义改造，这是一个比反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命更深刻更广泛的革命，包含着极复杂极尖锐的阶级斗争，这种斗争必然要反映到党内来。我们必须记取苏联共产党和我们党的历史教训，根据中共七届四中全会“关于增强党的团结的决议”的精神，提高政治警惕性，防止和克服一切危害党的团结的行为，像爱护自己的生命，爱护自己的眼珠一样爱护党的团结。只有这样，我们才能胜利地完成过渡时期的总任务，把我们国家建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。
                ×××
    斯大林论证了关于在一个国家内建成社会主义的可能性的理论，论证了马克思列宁主义关于工人阶级的“民族”任务和国际任务的一致和不可分割的原理。他用许多历史事实指明苏联工人阶级是在各国工人阶级的支持下建设社会主义的，他列举了苏联工人阶级与各国工人阶级的联盟的种种形式，他指出，没有这种种联盟和支持，在苏联建设社会主义是不可想像的。同时，一个国家的无产阶级革命的胜利不是最终目的，而是促进各国革命的发展和胜利的助力和手段。他指出，苏联社会主义建设的胜利，将促进各国工人阶级的革命斗争，使各国工人阶级有更多机会取得胜利。
    苏联人民在苏联共产党领导下以忘我的奋斗精神，完成了突击队的光荣使命，有力地援助了各国人民的革命运动，使人类免于受德国和日本法西斯主义的奴役，并继续领导着和平、民主和社会主义阵营为缓和国际紧张局势、为维护世界和平而奋斗。
    历史证明，中国人民革命的胜利，是和十月革命的胜利，苏联社会主义建设的胜利，苏联人民粉碎德国和日本法西斯主义的胜利分不开的。我国经济的迅速恢复和发展，第一个五年计划的顺利实施，没有苏联共产党、苏联政府和苏联人民的多方面的慷慨无私援助，是不可想像的。巩固和加强中国人民与苏联人民的永恒的友谊，是保卫远东和平和世界和平的强大堡垒，是把我国顺利地建设成为社会主义的工业国的重要保证。我们要学习苏联的丰富的社会主义建设经验，学习苏联人民的艰苦奋斗精神，学习他们的爱国主义精神和国际主义精神，发挥全国人民和国民经济中的一切潜在力量，加速国家工业化的过程，加速社会主义的改造过程，使以苏联为首的和平、民主和社会主义阵营更加巩固和强大起来。
                ×××
    在“斯大林全集”第九卷中，党的农民政策问题和工农联盟问题，占有显著的地位。斯大林科学地分析了和论证了党在农民问题上的三个基本口号，驳斥了歪曲党对农民的政策的谬论。
    斯大林指出，工农联盟和工人阶级在这一联盟中的领导作用是建设社会主义的保证。我们需要工农联盟，“是为了在符合于社会主义建设胜利的利益的方针下教育和改造农民”。（第一六六页）。可是，怎样才能保证和加强工人阶级对农民的领导呢？要做到这一点，就必须使国家工业化，必须使社会主义工业发展和巩固起来，必须使日益发展的社会主义工业带领着农业前进。因此，每个新建立起来的工厂，都是工人阶级的新堡垒，保证着工人阶级对千百万农民群众的领导。
    斯大林给社会主义经济基础下了一个定义，在这个定义中也阐明了社会主义建设时期工农联盟的内容和意义。他说：“建立社会主义的经济基础，就是把农业和社会主义工业结合为一个整体经济，使农业服从社会主义工业的领导，在农产品和工业品交换的基础上调整城乡关系，堵死和消灭阶级首先是资本借以产生的一切孔道，最后造成直接消灭阶级的生产条件和分配条件。”（第二一——二二页）
    可见，社会主义建设时期所需要的工农联盟，不是任何一种联盟，而是以消灭私有制消灭阶级为目标的、在工人阶级和社会主义工业领导下的、把广大农民教育和改造为社会主义的劳动者、把个体分散的农民经济改造为大规模的集体经济的工农联盟。
    斯大林指出，农民基本群众的利益和工人阶级的利益没有不可调和的矛盾，他们的利益根本上是一致的，不能像反对派所设想的那样，用损害农民基本群众利益的办法来实现工业化，因而走上把农民当做“殖民地”、当做“剥削对象”的道路，这样只能瓦解工农联盟，破坏工业化的基础。要真正保持工农联盟并继续发展农业，必须实行不断减低工业品价格的政策，这是工农的共同利益所要求的，这也是工业发展所必须遵循的基本路线。
    苏联人民依靠工农联盟已经建成了社会主义，现正依靠工农联盟的继续巩固向共产主义胜利迈进。
    斯大林关于社会主义建设时期工农联盟问题的阐述，对于我国目前有特别重要的现实意义。在我们党提出的过渡时期的总路线中，也正体现着用巩固和加强以工人阶级为领导的工农联盟的办法来进行社会主义建设这一马克思列宁主义的重要原则。我们国家正沿着社会主义工业化道路前进，同时积极地和稳步地发展互助合作运动，逐步完成对农业的社会主义改造，必然会巩固工农联盟，加强工人阶级在这一联盟中的领导作用，并完成对整个国民经济的社会主义改造。
                  ×××
    斯大林在联共（布）莫斯科省第十五次代表会议上的演说中指出，党在领导国家的社会主义建设事业中，有正确的路线，有正确的政策，这当然是首要的事情。但如果这种政策没有实行，或实行时被歪曲了，那末这种政策是没有什么用处的。工农联盟的命运，社会主义建设的命运，是取决于忠实执行正确的政策的。因此，要克服建设中的种种困难，只有正确的政策是不够的，还须像列宁指出的那样，做好正确挑选人材的工作并组织对执行情况的检查。“要领导建设，只有正确的指示是不够的，要领导建设，还必须把那些懂得这些指示的意义和作用，能够忠诚老实地实行这些指示，并认为实行这些指示不是无谓的例行公事而是光荣的事业，是自己对党和无产阶级应尽的崇高义务的人，放在我们苏维埃的、经济的、合作社的以及其他的建设工作的领导岗位上。”（第一四二页）
    要使党的正确的路线、正确的政策能够贯彻，还必须努力提高党对群众领导的质量，以顺利地吸引广大工农群众参加社会主义的建设工作。必须使党的领导，不是形式主义的领导，不是纸上的领导，不是官僚主义的领导，而是实际的领导；必须使党的领导具有灵活性，“对于群众的要求要有敏感、敏感、最高度的敏感”。（第一四五页）
    斯大林指出，由于建设战线上胜利的取得，由于工农群众觉悟的提高，群众对领导的要求更高了。对待工农群众不能采取官僚主义和命令主义的态度，必须将党和政府的指示，向他们“耐心地仔细地进行解释，使他们了解党要做些什么，要把国家引到哪里去。今天不了解，明天再努力解释；明天不了解，后天再努力解释。现在不这样，就不会有而且不能有任何领导”。（第一四四页）
    斯大林在二十多年以前所作的这些指示，在目前仍有极其现实的意义。
                  ×××
    在第九卷中占有很大篇幅的是关于中国革命的问题。斯大林同志在“中国革命问题”，“论中国革命的几个问题”、“和中山大学学生的谈话”、
  “中国革命和共产国际的任务”和“时事问题简评”等著作中，对中国革命作了科学的分析，明确地指出了中国革命的性质、动力和前途，粉碎了托洛茨基派的反列宁主义的路线。他着重指出两条道路的斗争是中国革命的特点：“或者是民族资产阶级击败无产阶级，和帝国主义勾结起来，共同进攻革命，以便建立资本主义的统治而结束革命；或者是无产阶级把民族资产阶级挤到一边，巩固自己的领导权，率领城乡千百万劳动群众克服民族资产阶级的反抗，取得资产阶级民主革命的完全胜利，然后把它逐渐转移到社会主义革命的轨道上，并取得由此而产生的一切结果”。“共产党人的基本任务就是为中国革命的第二条道路的胜利而奋斗。”（第一九九—二○○页）
    以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央委员会，正确地执行了斯大林的这些指示，领导中国人民取得了新民主主义革命的伟大胜利，现正继续巩固工人阶级的领导权，加强以工人阶级为领导的工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，领导全国人民执行第一个五年计划，完成社会主义建设、社会主义改造的伟大事业。
    收入第九卷的斯大林的著作，是丰富而多方面的。我国广大读者可以从这些著作中汲取力量，坚定社会主义建设的胜利信心，更好地为完成国家在过渡时期的总任务而奋斗。
