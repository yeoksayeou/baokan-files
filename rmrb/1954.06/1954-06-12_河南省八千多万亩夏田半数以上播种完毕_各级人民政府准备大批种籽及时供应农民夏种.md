Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 11th. More than half, approximately 55%, of Henan Province's 80 million mu of summer fields have been planted with late-autumn crops such as millet, corn, cotton, and sesame. Before the start of the summer planting season, most agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various regions formulated plans for wheat harvesting and summer planting, rationally organizing manpower and animal power. Since the end of May, the province has experienced several rounds of rainfall, which has been extremely beneficial for summer planting. Farmers in various regions are carrying out summer planting in a tense yet timely manner while harvesting wheat. Farmers in Mantoushan Village, Bo'ai County, led by the Yuan Yongde Agricultural Production Cooperative, have planted late-autumn crops on 190 mu of wheat stubble fields in the entire village. The Wei Zhijing mutual aid team in Xingfu Township, Qinyang County, seized the opportunity to plant before wheat harvesting, planting millet, corn, and other crops on 62 mu out of 64 mu of wheat fields. This event spurred farmers in the village where the Wei Zhijing mutual aid team is located to plant 650 mu of wheat stubble fields while harvesting. The Mengzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Runan County also revised its original summer planting plan, expanding the sesame planting area by more than double.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 11th. Governments at all levels in Henan Province prepared large quantities of late-autumn crop seeds early on to support farmers in carrying out summer planting in a timely manner according to the state plan. More than 58.4 million jin of various late-autumn crop seeds prepared by the seven special districts of Xinxiang, Zhengzhou, Nanyang, and Xinyang have been mostly transferred to rural areas and are being sold, pre-borrowed, and exchanged with farmers. More than 500,000 jin of improved corn seeds in the Xinxiang Special District have all been supplied to farmers. More than 400,000 jin of soybean seeds in Kaifeng County have also been mostly supplied to farmers. In order to ensure that farmers receive the seeds they need in a timely manner, many regions have established more supply points and simplified supply procedures. Due to the timely supply of seeds in Runan County, according to statistics from five districts, nine mutual aid teams, and one household, the sesame planting area has increased by 28.6% compared to last year.

    河南省八千多万亩夏田半数以上播种完毕
    各级人民政府准备大批种籽及时供应农民夏种
    【新华社开封十一日电】河南省八千多万亩夏田，已有百分之五十五左右种上谷子、玉米、棉花、芝麻等晚秋作物。夏种开始前，各地农业生产合作社和互助组大多订出了麦收、夏种计划，合理地组织了人力和畜力。五月底以来，全省先后数次降雨，对夏种极为有利。各地农民在收割小麦的同时，紧张而及时地进行夏种。博爱县馒头山村农民在袁永德农业生产合作社的带动下，已在全村一百九十亩麦茬地里种上晚秋作物。沁阳县幸福乡魏之经互助组在小麦收割前趁墒抢种，六十四亩麦田中有六十二亩种上了谷子、玉米等作物。这件事推动魏之经互助组所在村的农民随收随种六百五十亩麦茬地。汝南县孟庄农业生产合作社还修订了原来的夏种计划，扩大芝麻种植面积一倍多。
    【新华社开封十一日电】河南省各级人民政府及早准备了大批晚秋作物的种籽，支援农民按照国家计划适时进行夏种。新乡、郑州、南阳、信阳等七个专区准备的五千八百四十多万斤各种晚秋作物种籽，已大部调运到农村，正出售、预借和掉换给农民。新乡专区五十多万斤玉米良种已全部供应到农民手中。开封县四十多万斤黄豆种也已大部供应给农民。为使农民及时得到所需的种籽，不少地区增设了供应点，简化了供应手续。汝南县由于种籽供应及时，据五个区、九个互助组和一户的统计，芝麻播种面积比去年扩大了百分之二十八点六。
