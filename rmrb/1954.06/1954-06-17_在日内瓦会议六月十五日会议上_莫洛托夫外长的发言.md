Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates:

During the discussion of the Korean question on May 13th, the head of the British delegation expressed the opinion that it was necessary "to reach an agreement on basic principles." He listed five points of agreement that could be reached, mentioning the following: holding elections to form an all-Korean government, adhering to the principle of proportional representation in both North and South Korea during the elections, guaranteeing freedom of elections based on universal suffrage and secret ballot, international supervision of elections under the auspices of the United Nations, and determining the conditions for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea. Mr. Eden said in his speech: "If agreement is reached on the five principles I have proposed, the conference can proceed to the actual work of drafting clauses and stages."

On June 5th, the Soviet delegation submitted to the conference a proposal on the basic principles for resolving the Korean question. In several respects, this proposal is largely consistent with the suggestions of the British delegation. The Soviet draft resolution also stipulated five points, and everyone can easily see that these five points are raised more precisely and specifically.

The essence of the Soviet proposal is expressed in the following basic provisions:

    One: Free all-Korean elections should be held within six months, adhering to the principle of proportional representation throughout Korea.
    Two: To prepare and conduct free all-Korean elections, an all-Korean committee should be formed by representatives from North and South Korea.
    Three: All foreign troops should be withdrawn from Korea before the elections are held.
    Four: An international commission should be established to supervise the holding of free all-Korean elections.
    Five: It is necessary for countries that have the most direct interest in maintaining peace in the Far East to undertake obligations to ensure the peaceful development of Korea.

When submitting these proposals, the Soviet delegation pointed out that there was some reconciliation of opinions on certain basic principles that served as the basis for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, and also pointed out that there were still some differences of opinion on certain issues. We also pointed out at the same time that we agreed with the British delegation that we hoped to determine the basic principles for reaching an agreement on the Korean question.

What would it mean if the proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation were adopted after some modifications? Undoubtedly, if the conference adopts appropriate decisions, it would be a step forward in the preparatory work for restoring the reunification of Korea. The adoption of the Soviet's five-point proposal, after possible amendments, although not sufficient to resolve the issue of restoring Korean reunification, would be conducive to drafting a resolution that could be implemented in a timely manner.

The Soviet delegation's proposal received full endorsement from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China. However, the countries attending this conference that participated in the three-year war of aggression against Korea under the banner of the United Nations rudely refused to give concrete consideration to these proposals.

It has been exposed here that these countries are unwilling—at least for the moment—to seek to make the participants of the Geneva Conference work together to at least take a step forward to promote the reunification of Korea. No amount of hypocritical rhetoric attacking communist countries can obscure this obvious fact. From this, it is not difficult to understand why, on the one hand, they express their unwillingness to recognize the fairness and rationality of the Soviet proposals, but on the other hand, they cannot put forward any other proposals that would help begin the reunification of Korea.

On June 11th, the Canadian representative was the main speaker expressing opinions on the Soviet proposals. On that day, he raised so many irrelevant and completely inappropriate questions about the Soviet proposals that it could only be regarded as a conspiracy to confuse the public. But the Canadian representative also made a conclusion that was not difficult to understand. He said these few words at the end:

"We had better face the fact that we disagree and recognize those facts; we had better not deceive ourselves with fictitious hopes, and not let the world believe that there has been an agreement when there is no agreement yet."

Only one conclusion can be drawn from the words of the Canadian representative: we should abandon the effort to seek the possibility of reaching an agreement on at least some basic principles for resolving the Korean question, because since an agreement is impossible, we should not use seeking such an agreement to confuse public opinion. If this is indeed the case, then why did the Canadian representative remain silent about the British delegation's proposal on May 13th? The British delegation's proposal also suggested "reaching an agreement on major principles" and considered this to be very necessary. If the Canadian representative said that it was not permissible to use proposals that could illustrate that certain provisions had been recognized by the countries participating in the Geneva Conference to confuse public opinion, then does this attack apply to the British delegation's proposal on basic principles? If one hopes to persuade others, he must not forget that he must follow some logic.

On June 11th, the head of the French delegation supported the speech of the Canadian representative. However, his proposals on the Korean question also included five points. Most of them were somewhat similar to the proposals of the Soviet delegation and the proposals of the British delegation. However, the French delegation, like the Canadian delegation, also believed that it was completely inappropriate to talk about adopting general principles on the Korean question at the Geneva Conference. So, one must ask, did the French delegation seriously treat its five-point proposal on the general principles of the Korean question?

The Belgian representative, Spaak, even said that the Soviet delegation's proposal would cause "disastrous consequences" for the United Nations. According to him, these proposals should be considered "fatal" to the United Nations.

The only reason for making all these "terrible" eloquent speeches is that the Soviet's provision to establish an international commission to supervise the all-Korean elections did not stipulate that the United Nations should establish this commission. But Mr. Spaak seems to have forgotten that when we convened the Geneva Conference with his participation, we did so without the United Nations. However, we did not consider this impermissible at that time and at present.

In his speech on June 11th, the head of the British delegation did not mention the five basic principles on the Korean question he put forward on May 13th. This time, as he said, he only focused on "two issues": the authority of the United Nations and the principle of free elections. Of course, none of the participants of the Geneva Conference denied: it is necessary to attach importance to—not in words, but in actions—the authority of the United Nations and the need to observe the principle of free elections in Korea. Some other delegations who styled themselves as defenders of the United Nations also declared their opposition to the Soviet delegation's proposals.

Now, I only need to once again draw the attention of this conference to the fact that there are various different ways to defend the authority of the United Nations, and not every so-called "defense" is helpful to strengthening this authority. In the Korean War, the banner of the United Nations was used under the pressure of the American aggression group to damage the principles of the United Nations and the Charter of the United Nations itself. One cannot use this method to consolidate the authority of this international organization. The Soviet government has been and is now safeguarding the authority of the United Nations organization, preventing its authority from being damaged by violations of its charter, and preventing its authority from being devalued by using this international organization to serve this or that group of aggressive countries.

As for the principle of free all-Korean elections, the Soviet proposals fully stipulate that this principle must be observed. If we speak from the interests of guaranteeing the freedom of all-Korean elections, none of those who spoke against the Soviet proposals can find anything objectionable in this proposal by any means.

The suggestion to establish an all-Korean committee composed of representatives from North and South Korea to prepare for and hold elections has been most fiercely attacked here. However, the very fact of refusing to establish an all-Korean body to prepare for the elections proves disrespect for the rights of the Korean people, because matters such as holding all-Korean elections should be in the hands of the Koreans themselves, the Korean people. This refusal, regardless of its motives, is an attempt to impose the Syngman Rhee regime of South Korea on North Korea, an attempt that, as everyone knows, three years of war failed to achieve. Therefore, the unwillingness to establish an all-Korean body to hold free all-Korean elections is an artificial means used to undermine the only possibility of holding all-Korean elections. The attempt to hand over the issue of all-Korean elections to the United Nations organization is obviously unfounded, because the United Nations was a belligerent party in Korea, and therefore it has no moral basis to act as an impartial body on the Korean issue. This attempt cannot absolve those people of the responsibility: those who are even unwilling to carry out the preliminary work of preparing for the national reunification of Korea under conditions that can be accepted by most of the people in North and South Korea.

The discussion has proved that the majority of countries now participating in the Geneva Conference have made it impossible to even reach an agreement on the preliminary work of restoring the reunification of Korea.

However, the Soviet government will strive to ensure that all future opportunities are also utilized in order to reach an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Korean question on the basis of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic Korean state.

We believe that, under the current circumstances, what can promote the restoration of Korean reunification to the greatest extent is to guarantee the conditions for the peaceful development of northern and southern Korea in the future. The proposal put forward by the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today, which aims to consolidate the conditions of peace in Korea, is in line with these aims.

Based on the above, the Soviet delegation supports these two proposals, namely, the proposal to determine a deadline for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea that is as short as possible, and the proposal to reduce the troop strength of the North Korean and South Korean armies. The Syngman Rhee elements in South Korea may not like such proposals; however, there is no doubt that these proposals are in line with the interests of the Korean people and the interests of consolidating international peace.

The Soviet delegation also supports the suggestion that a committee composed of representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea should study how to create conditions to gradually eliminate the state of war in Korea and to transfer the armies of both sides to a state of peace. The adoption of this resolution will not only improve the economic situation of the people in northern and southern Korea, but also have important significance for consolidating peace throughout the Far East. At the same time, the Soviet delegation wholeheartedly supports the demand of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that the governments of the United States and some other countries should lift the obviously illegal measures of blockade and embargo against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, because this not only violates the most basic rules of international law under the current conditions, but is also obviously a crime against the Korean people.

If the conference believes that situations where either part of Korea has treaties with other countries involving military obligations are not in line with the interests of peaceful reunification of Korea, that is completely correct.

At the same time, we cannot but point out that the so-called "common defense treaty" signed between the United States and South Korea is fundamentally contrary to the interests of Korean peace. This treaty stipulates that US armed forces will be stationed indefinitely on the territory of South Korea. In other words, the above-mentioned treaty means the permanent foreign occupation of Korean territory. Its purpose is not to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, but to support aggressive plans through new military adventures in Korea. It is necessary to prevent the American aggression group from turning South Korea into a springboard for launching a new war in the Far East. It is very obvious that this type of treaty is incompatible with the interests of the Korean people.

At the same time, the Soviet delegation supports the proposal to establish an all-Korean committee that will study and implement mutually agreeable measures on issues of establishing and developing economic and cultural relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea. Denying the necessity of this step is to hinder the reconciliation between North and South Korea, and to hinder the work of preparing conditions for the restoration of the reunification of the Korean people.

It would be particularly important if the participants of the Geneva Conference could specifically declare that they recognize the necessity of guaranteeing the peaceful development of Korea. There is no doubt that such international assistance would be wholeheartedly supported by the Korean people. The recognition of this necessity by other countries can help create conditions for peacefully resolving the task of unifying Korea into a unified, independent, and democratic country.

Today, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has put forward proposals, and the Soviet delegation also puts forward the following draft joint declaration of all participants of the Geneva Conference for discussion by the conference:

  “Declaration on Korea
  The countries participating in the Geneva Conference have agreed that, pending the final resolution of the Korean issue on the basis of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic state, no action shall be taken that could constitute a threat to maintaining peace in Korea.

  The participants express their belief that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea will act in accordance with this declaration for the sake of peace.”

The Soviet delegation believes that every step taken by the Geneva Conference to consolidate the further peaceful development of Korea is also of great significance for easing international tensions and for consolidating world peace.

### 在日内瓦会议六月十五日会议上  莫洛托夫外长的发言

专栏：

    在日内瓦会议六月十五日会议上
    莫洛托夫外长的发言主席先生，各位代表先生：
    在五月十三日讨论朝鲜问题的时候，英国代表团团长表示了认为有必要“在基本原则上达成协议”的意见。他列举了所能达成的协议的五点，提到了以下这些：举行选举、以组成全朝鲜政府，在选举中无论在北朝鲜和南朝鲜都遵守比例代表制的原则，保证在普遍选举权和秘密投票的基础上的选举自由，在联合国组织的主持下对选举进行国际监察，决定从朝鲜撤退外国军队的条件。艾登先生在发言中说：“假如在我所提议的五个原则上达成协议，会议就能着手进行拟订条款和阶段的实际工作。”
    六月五日，苏联代表团向会议提出了关于解决朝鲜问题的基本原则的建议。在若干点上，这个建议是和英国代表团的建议大体上一致的。在苏联的决议草案中也规定了五点，而且大家能毫无困难地看出，这五点提得比较精确、比较具体。
    苏联建议的实质，表现于以下的基本规定：
  　一、在六个月内举行全朝鲜自由选举、在全朝鲜遵守比例代表制的原则。
    二、为准备和进行全朝鲜自由选举，由北朝鲜和南朝鲜的代表组成全朝鲜委员会。
    三、一切外国军队在选举举行以前撤出朝鲜。
    四、成立国际委员会来监察全朝鲜自由选举的举行。
    五、认为对维护远东和平有最直接关系的国家有必要承担义务，来保证朝鲜的和平发展。
    在提出这些建议时，苏联代表团就指出：在作为和平解决朝鲜问题的基础的某些基本原则上大家的意见有了一些调和，又指出：在若干问题上还有一些意见分歧。我们同时指出，我们同意英国代表团的意见，就是希望能决定在朝鲜问题上达成协议的基本原则。
    如果苏联代表团提出的建议在经过某种修改之后获得通过，这意味着什么呢？无疑地，会议如通过适当决定，那将是在恢复朝鲜国家统一的准备工作中前进了一步。通过苏联的经过可能的修正的五点建议，虽然还不足以解决恢复朝鲜国家统一的问题，但将有利于拟订出这样的决议来及时地加以执行。
    苏联代表团的建议获得了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的完全赞成。但是，出席这次会议的、在联合国旗帜下参加过三年侵朝战争的国家，粗暴地拒绝对这些建议加以具体考虑。
    在这里已经暴露出来，这些国家不愿意——至少在目前——设法使日内瓦会议的参加者共同努力，以便至少向前走一步，来促使朝鲜国家恢复统一。用种种伪善的言词来攻击共产主义国家，也掩饰不了这一显而易见的事实。从这里就不难了解，为什么它们一方面表示不愿意承认苏联建议的公平合理，但另一方面却又提不出任何其他有助于开始恢复朝鲜国家统一的建议。
    六月十一日，加拿大代表是对苏联的建议表示意见的主要发言人。他在那一天，对苏联的建议提出了这样多的不相干的和完全不适当的问题，以致这只能被认为是一种混淆视听的阴谋。但是加拿大代表也作出了一个令人不难理解的结论。他在最后说了这样几句话：
    “我们最好正视我们意见分歧的事实，并承认这些事实，最好不要以虚构的希望来欺骗自己，不要在还没有协议的时候就要世界人民相信已经有了协议。”
    从加拿大代表的话中只能得出一个结论：应该放弃至少在解决朝鲜问题的某些基本原则上寻求达成协议的可能性的努力，因为协议既然不可能达成，那么就不应该用寻求这种协议来迷惑舆论。如果情况果真如此，那么加拿大代表为什么对英国代表团五月十三日的建议默不作声呢？英国代表团的建议也建议“就主要原则达成协议”，并认为这是十分必要的。如果加拿大代表说不允许利用可以说明有某些规定已为日内瓦会议与会各国所承认的建议来迷惑舆论的话，那么，这种攻击是否适用于英国代表团提出的关于基本原则的建议呢？一个人如果希望说服人的话，他一定不能忘记必须要遵循某种逻辑。
    六月十一日，法国代表团团长支持加拿大代表的发言。然而，他提出的关于朝鲜问题的建议也包括五个要点。其中大部分和苏联代表团的建议以及英国代表团的建议多少有些类似。但是，法国代表团像加拿大代表团一样，也认为完全不适宜于在日内瓦会议上谈通过关于朝鲜问题的一般原则。那么，就要问，法国代表团是否认真对待它的关于朝鲜问题的一般原则的五点建议呢？
    比利时代表斯巴克甚至说，苏联代表团的建议对联合国说来会引起“灾难性的后果”，据他说，应该认为这些建议对联合国说来是“致命的”。
    作出这一切“可怕的”雄辩的唯一理由就是，苏联的规定成立一个国际委员会来监察全朝鲜选举的建议没有规定由联合国来设立这个委员会。但是，斯巴克先生似乎忘记了，当我们召开有他参加的日内瓦会议时，我们是在没有联合国的情况下这样做的。但是，我们在当时以及在现在都没有认为这是不能容许的。
    英国代表团团长在六月十一日的发言中没有提到他在五月十三日提出的关于朝鲜问题的五项基本原则。这一次，如他所说的，他只专心于“两个问题”：联合国的权威问题和自由选举的原则问题。当然，日内瓦会议的参加者没有一个否认：必须重视——不是在口头上，而是在行动上——联合国的权威和遵守朝鲜自由选举的原则的必要性。一些以联合国的保卫者自居的其他代表团也宣称它们反对苏联代表团的建议。
    现在，我只须再一次提起本会议注意一个事实，这就是：可以用各种不同的方法来保卫联合国的权威，并不是每一种所谓“保卫”都是有助于增强这种权威的，在朝鲜战争中，联合国的旗帜在美国侵略集团的压力下被用来损害联合国的原则和联合国宪章本身。一个人不能用这种方法来巩固这个国际组织的权威。苏联政府过去和现在都在维护联合国组织的权威，不让它的权威因为有人违反了它的宪章而受到破坏，不让它的权威因为有人用这个国际机构来为这个或那个侵略国家集团服务而贬低。
    至于全朝鲜自由选举的原则，苏联的建议充分规定了要遵守这个原则。如果从保障全朝鲜选举的自由的利益来说，发言反对苏联建议的这些人中，没有一个人能以任何方法从这个建议中找出可以非议的地方。
    成立一个由南、北朝鲜代表组成的全朝鲜委员会来准备并举行选举的建议在这里受到最激烈的攻击。然而拒绝建立全朝鲜机构来准备选举这一事实本身就证明不尊重朝鲜人民的权利，因为像举行全朝鲜选举这种事应该由朝鲜人自己、由朝鲜人民来掌握。这种拒绝，不论动机如何，都是企图把南朝鲜李承晚统治强加于北朝鲜，而这个企图，大家都知道，三年的战争就没有达到目的。因此，不愿意成立全朝鲜机构来举行全朝鲜的自由选举，是一种人为的手段，用它来破坏举行全朝鲜选举的唯一可能性。想把全朝鲜选举的问题交给联合国组织的企图显然是毫无根据的，因为联合国在朝鲜是交战一方，因此它要在朝鲜问题上起一个公正机构的作用是没有道义基础的。这种企图并不能使这样一些人推卸责任：这些人甚至不愿意进行在能为北朝鲜和南朝鲜的大部分人民所接受的条件下准备朝鲜的国家统一的初步工作。
    讨论证明，现在参加日内瓦会议的大多数国家使得甚至就恢复朝鲜国家统一的初步工作达成协议都成为不可能。
    但是，苏联政府将争取，今后的一切机会也都被利用，以便达成一个在建立统一、独立和民主的朝鲜国家的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题的协议。
    我们认为，在目前的情况下，能在最大范围内促进朝鲜国家统一的恢复的是，使朝鲜北部和南部今后和平发展的条件得到保证。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表今天提出的目的在于巩固朝鲜的和平条件的建议是符合这些目的的。
    根据上述，苏联代表团支持这两个建议，即确定一个自朝鲜撤出一切外国军队的、尽可能短的期限的建议以及裁减北朝鲜和南朝鲜的军队兵力的建议。南朝鲜的李承晚分子可能不喜欢这样的建议；但是，毫无疑问，这些建议是符合朝鲜人民的利益和巩固国际和平的利益的。
    苏联代表团也支持这样一个建议，即由朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国的代表组成委员会来研究如何创造条件以逐渐消除朝鲜的战争状态，并使双方军队转入和平状态的问题。通过这一决议，不仅能改善朝鲜北部和南部人民的经济状况，而且对巩固整个远东和平也有重要的意义。同时，苏联代表团衷心支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的要求，即美国和其他一些国家的政府应当取消对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国实行封锁和禁运的这种显然非法的措施，因为这在目前的条件下不仅违反起码的国际法规则，而且显然是对朝鲜人民的一种罪行。
    如果会议认为无论朝鲜的哪一部分跟其他国家之间有着牵涉到军事义务的条约这种情形不符合和平统一朝鲜的利益，那是完全正确的。
    同时，我们不能不指出，美国和南朝鲜之间签订的所谓“共同防御条约”是根本违反朝鲜和平的利益的。这个条约规定美国武装部队无限期地驻在南朝鲜领土上。换一句话说，上述条约就意味着外国永久占领朝鲜领土。它的目的不是和平解决朝鲜问题，而是通过在朝鲜的新军事冒险来支持侵略计划。必须阻止美国侵略集团把南朝鲜变成在远东发动新战争的跳板。这样一类的条约和朝鲜人民利益不相容，是非常明显的。
    同时，苏联代表团支持建立全朝鲜委员会的建议，这个委员会将就建立和发展朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国之间的经济和文化关系问题研究出大家都能同意的措施，并执行这些措施。否认这一步骤的必要性，就是阻碍北朝鲜和南朝鲜的和解，阻碍为恢复朝鲜人民的统一准备条件的工作。
    日内瓦会议的参加者如能特别宣布它们承认保证朝鲜和平发展的必要性，这将是一件特别重要的事。毫无疑问，这样一种国际援助将得到朝鲜人民的衷心拥护。其他国家承认这种必要性，就能有助于创造和平解决把朝鲜统一成为一个统一、独立和民主的国家的任务的条件。
    今天朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团提出了建议，苏联代表团也提出下列日内瓦会议全体参加者共同宣言草案请会议讨论：
      “关于朝鲜的宣言
    参加日内瓦会议的各国业已同意：在等待朝鲜问题在建立一个统一、独立、民主国家的基础上最后解决期间，不得采取任何可能足以对维持朝鲜和平构成威胁的行动。
    与会者表示相信，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国将为了和平的利益依照本宣言而行动。”
    苏联代表团认为，日内瓦会议为了巩固朝鲜的进一步和平发展而采取的每一步骤，同时也对缓和国际紧张局势和对巩固世界和平具有重大的意义。
