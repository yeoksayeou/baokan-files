In Ya'an, Tianquan, Hanyuan, Xichang, Huili, Luding and other places in Xikang Province, thirteen handicraft production cooperatives have been established, including nine iron industry production cooperatives, and the rest are papermaking, sewing, pottery and other production cooperatives. There are more than 400 organized handicraft producers in the province.

These handicraft production cooperatives have been gradually developed through lower forms such as production teams. When establishing handicraft production cooperatives, the preparatory committee of the Xikang Provincial Cooperative Union and the cooperative unions of various counties carried out cooperation education for handicraft workers and specifically helped establish various necessary systems. Now, many handicraft production cooperatives have shown the advantages of being organized. The number of hoes produced by members of the Xichang Iron Industry Production Cooperative has increased more than four times compared with before the organization; the output of sickles of the Huili Iron Industry Production Cooperative is 80% higher than that of individual handicraftsmen. The average monthly income of members of the No. 1 Ironware and Agricultural Tool Production Cooperative in Jiuxiang Town, Hanyuan County, has increased from 320,000 yuan before the organization to 440,000 yuan, and each person can also receive more than 200,000 yuan of labor return money each year; at the same time, there is a system of public medical care in the cooperative, and there is a certain amount of study time every day.

    西康省在雅安天全等地
    建立一批手工业生产合作社
    西康省在雅安、天全、汉源、西昌、会理、泸定等地已建立十三个手工业生产合作社，其中有九个是铁业生产合作社，其余是造纸、缝纫、陶器等生产合作社。全省组织起来的手工业生产者约有四百多人。
    这些手工业生产合作社都是经过生产小组等低级形式逐步发展起来的。在建立手工业生产合作社时，西康省合作社联合社筹备委员会和各县合作社联合社都对手工业者进行了合作化的教育，具体帮助建立了各种必要的制度。现在，许多手工业生产合作社已经显示出组织起来的优越性。西昌铁业生产合作社社员生产挖锄的数量，比组织起来以前增加了四倍多；会理铁业生产合作社镰刀的产量，比个体手工业者高出百分之八十。汉源县九襄镇第一铁器农具生产合作社社员每人每月的平均收入，由组织起来以前的三十二万元增加到四十四万元，另外每人每年还可分到劳动返还金二十多万元；同时社内有公费医疗的制度，每天并有一定的学习时间。
