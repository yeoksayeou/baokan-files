At the Hanshui Iron Bridge construction site, over the past seven months of intense construction, many outstanding skilled workers and young interns have gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. By the beginning of June, newly admitted Party members accounted for approximately 30% of the total number of Party members in the entire Hanshui Iron Bridge engineering section.

Most of these new Party members are skilled technicians such as riggers, crane operators, lathe operators, barge commanders, and carpenters, who played an active role in the most arduous underwater construction of the Hanshui Iron Bridge. The rigging team led by Kuang Yongfu and Bi Yunzhi, who are very familiar to the workers, excellently completed their tasks in both land and water pile driving projects, as well as in the most difficult construction of the two bridge piers. When pile driving on the water, Kuang Yongfu's team once created a record of driving 74 meters in eight hours, the highest in the entire section. He proposed improving the method of hoisting pipe piles with a universal pile driver, reducing the time to hoist one pipe pile from 22 minutes to 6 minutes. When Bi Yunzhi's team was driving steel sheet piles for a certain pier, they improved labor organization and operating methods, reducing the time to insert each pair of steel sheets from 55 minutes to 5 minutes, greatly accelerating the progress of the project. When this team was tasked with assembling steel beams, they also saved more than 170 work hours compared to the original quota.

Among these outstanding workers who have been admitted to the Party, there are also several workers who have been recognized as outstanding members of the Communist Youth League. Wang Houcheng, a member of the Communist Youth League, was originally a crane driver who could only operate small cranes. After coming to the construction site for just over a month, he has quickly grown into a skilled universal pile driver operator by humbly learning from veteran workers. When he operated the universal pile driver on a certain pier, the entire team achieved a record of driving 200 meters in seven hours, more than doubling the prescribed target. Young interns Li Yingzhong and Wang Qi graduated from Tangshan Railway College last year. After participating in the Hanshui Iron Bridge project, they humbly learned from the workers, actively studied technology, and also learned the excellent qualities of selfless labor of the working class. In March of this year, the cofferdam of steel sheet piles on a certain pier was leaking. In order to plug the leak, Li Yingzhong took off his cotton coat and jumped into the water, which was half a person deep, to plug the leak for three or four hours. At that time, many workers also jumped into the water to plug the leak.

Many of these outstanding workers who have been admitted to the Party have had significant achievements in their past work. Among the group of Party members admitted in the water work area, 15 had been commended and rewarded for their contributions in the past. Bi Yunzhi and others have received awards more than three times. (Xinhua News Agency)

    汉水铁桥工地很多工人光荣地加入共产党
    汉水铁桥工地在过去紧张施工的七个多月中，有很多优秀的技术工人和青年实习生光荣地加入了中国共产党。到六月上旬，新吸收入党的党员已占整个汉水铁桥工程段党员总数的百分之三十左右。
    这些新党员大部分是工程中熟练的装吊工、起重工、机械镟工、吊船指挥和木工等技术工人，他们在汉水铁桥最艰巨的水下施工过程中，发挥了积极作用。为工人们最熟悉的装吊工长匡永福和毕云芝带领的装吊小组，无论在陆上和水上打桩工程中，或在最艰巨的两个桥墩的施工过程中，都出色地完成了任务。匡永福小组在水上打桩时，曾创造了八小时打七十四公尺的全段最高纪录，他提议改进万能打桩机吊管桩的方法，使吊一根管桩的时间由二十二分钟缩短到六分钟。毕云芝小组在打某号墩钢板桩时，改善了劳动组织和操作方法，使插每对钢板的时间由五十五分钟减少到五分钟，大大加快了工程的进度。这个小组在担任拼装钢梁的任务时，还比原来的定额节省了一百七十多个工时。
    在这些被吸收入党的优秀工人中，还有好几个被评为优秀青年团员的工人。青年团员王厚成原来是个只能掌握小型吊车的吊车司机，在来到工地短短的一个多月后，由于虚心地向老工人学习，已迅速地成长为一个熟练的万能打桩机司机。他在某号桥墩上操纵万能打桩机时，全小组曾达到七小时打二百公尺的纪录，比规定的指标提高了二倍以上。青年实习生李应钟和王圻是去年从唐山铁道学院毕业的学生，他们参加汉水铁桥工程后，虚心向工人学习，积极钻研技术，还学习了工人阶级忘我劳动的优秀品质。今年三月，某号桥墩钢板桩围堰内漏水，为了堵塞漏洞，李应钟把棉衣一脱，跳到大半人深的水里堵了三四个钟头，当时有许多工人也都纷纷跳下水去堵塞漏洞。
    这些被吸收入党的优秀工人中，不少人在过去的工作中有过显著的成绩。在水上工区所吸收的一批党员中，有十五人曾在过去的工作中立功受奖，毕云芝等曾受奖三次以上。（新华社）
