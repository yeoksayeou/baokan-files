    People of All Ethnic Groups in the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region and the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region of Hunan Province Warmly Welcome the Draft Constitution
    After the newspapers containing the full text of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China were delivered to Kangding, the capital of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region, on June 19, the local wired broadcasting station immediately broadcast it to people of all ethnic groups and from all walks of life in the urban area in both Tibetan and Chinese. Representatives of various ethnic groups, including Tibetan and Hui, made statements expressing their warm support. Riku Living Buddha, Secretary-General of the Autonomous Region People's Government, said: The Draft Constitution has enshrined the common aspirations of all Tibetan monks and laypeople in legal form. I firmly support this draft constitution, which belongs to all ethnic groups. Kongsa Yido, Deputy Secretary-General of the Autonomous Region People's Government, said: The People's Republic of China has achieved great success and gained much experience in ethnic work in the years since its founding. The Draft Constitution summarizes this experience and makes detailed and clear provisions on ethnic issues. This shows the infinite care of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government for minority nationalities, and we are very happy about this. Soiren Kezun Lama, Director of the Finance Department of the Autonomous Region People's Government, said: Our minority nationalities have suffered from national oppression for many years. Only after liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have we gained national equality and started a happy life. The Draft Constitution clearly stipulates that our country is a unified multi-ethnic country. All ethnic groups are equal. Discrimination and oppression against any ethnic group are prohibited, as is any act that undermines ethnic unity. All ethnic groups have the freedom to develop their own languages and scripts and to maintain or reform their own customs and religious beliefs. These provisions make us feel even more the lovability of our great motherland and make us even more grateful to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Tuden Kanbu, Vice President of the Autonomous Region People's Court, said excitedly: The formulation of this great Draft Constitution is inseparable from the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. It consolidates the achievements already made by the people of all ethnic groups in the country and will guarantee that our country enters a prosperous and happy socialist society. Sha Xiaozhou (Hui nationality), Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Autonomous Region People's Government, said: The promulgation of the Draft Constitution is a great happy event for the people of all ethnic groups in our country. I will study and discuss it conscientiously with the spirit of being masters of our own affairs.

    The Draft Constitution has been warmly welcomed by the people of all ethnic groups in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region of Hunan Province. Shi Meiqun (Miao nationality), Deputy Director of the Jishou County Democratic Women's Federation, said: In the old society, women of our minority nationalities suffered the most. Today, the Draft Constitution completely enshrines the rights and interests of our women in all aspects. The state cares so deeply about us women. Our Miao sisters must always love our new China. Long Shengchang, a Miao cadre in Baojing County, recalled the scene in the past when Miao students did not dare to speak Miao language when studying outside, and even dared not reveal their hometown. He said: After liberation, we have already had autonomous rights and enjoyed the warmth of the motherland's big family. Now, the rights that our Miao people could not even dream of in the old society have all been written into the Draft Constitution.
    The Draft Constitution Discussion Committees of the Autonomous Region and various counties have formulated plans for publicizing and discussing the Draft Constitution. The Propaganda Department of the CPC Xiangxi Local Committee is organizing party reporters to give reports to people of all ethnic groups and from all walks of life in Jishou County. Propaganda teams from various counties are being organized and will soon begin their activities.

    各族人民热烈欢迎宪法草案
    六月十九日，刊登中华人民共和国宪法草案全文的报纸送到西康省藏族自治区首府康定以后，当地有线广播站立即用藏语、汉语向城区各族各界人民作了广播。自治区藏、回等各民族人士发表谈话，表示热烈拥护。自治区人民政府秘书长日库活佛说：宪法草案把我们全体藏族僧俗人民的共同愿望，用法律形式固定下来了。我坚决拥护这个各族人民自己的宪法草案。自治区人民政府副秘书长孔萨益多说：中华人民共和国开国几年来，在民族工作上得到了很大成绩，取得许多经验，宪法草案总结了这些经验，对民族问题作了详尽明确的规定。这说明了中国共产党和中央人民政府对少数民族的无限关怀，我们感到非常高兴。自治区人民政府财政处处长所仁克尊大喇嘛说：我们少数民族多少年来受尽了民族压迫的痛苦，只有在解放后，在共产党、毛主席领导下，才得到了民族平等，开始了幸福的生活。宪法草案明文规定了我国是统一的多民族的国家。各民族一律平等。禁止对任何民族的歧视和压迫，禁止破坏各民族团结的行为。各民族都有发展自己的语言文字的自由，都有保持或者改革自己的风俗习惯和宗教信仰的自由。这些规定，使我们更加感到伟大祖国的可爱，更加感激共产党和毛主席。自治区人民法院副院长土登堪布兴奋地说：这个伟大的宪法草案的制定是和共产党、毛主席的正确领导分不开的，它巩固了全国各族人民已取得的成绩，并将保障我们国家进入繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。自治区人民政府民政处处长沙筱舟（回族）说：宪法草案的公布，是我们全国各族人民的大喜事，我要以当家作主的精神，认真地进行学习和讨论。　（新华社）

    宪法草案在湖南省湘西苗族自治区受到了各族人民的热烈欢迎。吉首县民主妇女联合会副主任石美群（苗族）说：在旧社会我们少数民族妇女受苦最深，今天宪法草案把我们妇女在各方面的权利和利益完全固定下来，国家对我们妇女关切这样深，我们苗族姐妹要永远热爱我们的新中国。保靖县苗族干部龙升昌回忆过去苗族学生在外面读书不敢讲苗话，甚至连自己的家乡都不敢吐露出来的情景，他说：解放以后，我们已经有了自治权利，享受到祖国大家庭的温暖，如今我们苗族在旧社会里做梦也想不到的权利，都订到宪法草案里面了。
    自治区和各县的宪法草案讨论委员会已订出了宣传、讨论宪法草案的计划。中共湘西地方委员会宣传部正组织党的报告员向吉首县各族各界人民作报告。各县的宣传队伍正在组织中，就要展开活动。
