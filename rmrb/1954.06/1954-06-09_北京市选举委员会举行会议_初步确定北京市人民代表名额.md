    Beijing Municipal Election Committee Holds Meeting
    Preliminary Determination of Number of People's Representatives for Beijing

    [Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Municipal Election Committee held its third meeting on the 7th, approving the summary of the grassroots election work in Beijing, discussing the nomination methods for candidates for representatives to the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, and the issue of allocating the number of representatives.

    Beijing's grassroots elections began in June of last year and were completed at the end of March this year. The number of voters participating in the election accounted for 92.18% of the total number of voters in the city, and if voters who were temporarily away on polling day are excluded, the figure reaches 97.12%. The representative candidates, who were nominated after fully promoting democracy, earnest discussions, and repeated consultations, have been widely supported by voters. The elected representatives generally received a high proportion of the total votes cast, with half of the representatives receiving more than 90% of the total votes cast. A total of 2,118 representatives to the district people's congresses were elected in the thirteen districts of Beijing, both urban and suburban. The election results fully reflect the strengthening of the leading position of the working class and the further consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. They also reflect the great unity of all ethnic groups and democratic strata, which will be more conducive to further uniting people from all walks of life under the leadership of the working class, and striving to realize the general task of the state during the transition period.

    Now, all townships and towns in the suburbs of Beijing have convened their first township or town people's congresses, elected township people's government committees and representatives to the district people's congresses, and discussed and arranged this year's agricultural production work and plans for carrying out the mutual aid and cooperation movement. After these plans were conveyed to the voters by the representatives, they have become the actual actions of the masses. The first district people's congresses of each district are actively preparing, and will be convened soon.

    In accordance with the spirit of the Election Law, the meeting discussed the nomination methods for candidates for representatives to the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, and tentatively determined the number of representatives to the Municipal People's Congress to be 560. These representatives will be elected by the people's congresses of each district. According to the provisions of the Election Law, the number of people represented by each representative in the suburbs should be greater than the number of people represented by each representative in the urban areas. The meeting decided that each district in the urban area could elect one representative for every 5,000 people, and each district in the suburban area could elect one representative for every 6,000 to 7,000 people.

    北京市选举委员会举行会议
    初步确定北京市人民代表名额
    【本报讯】北京市选举委员会在七日举行第三次会议，通过了北京市基层选举工作总结，讨论了北京市人民代表大会代表候选人提名办法和代表名额分配问题。
    北京市基层选举从去年六月份开始，今年三月底完成。全市参加选举的选民占选民总数的百分之九十二点一八，如果除去在投票日临时外出的选民，则达百分之九十七点一二。经过充分发扬民主、认真讨论、反复协商而提出的代表候选人，受到选民的普遍拥护。当选的代表一般得票都占投票总数的很高比例，其中半数代表所得票数占投票总数的百分之九十以上。北京市城、郊十三个区共选出区人民代表大会代表二千一百一十八名。选举的结果，充分体现了工人阶级领导地位的加强和工农联盟的进一步巩固，也体现了各民族、各民主阶层的大团结，因而将更有利于在工人阶级领导下进一步团结各阶层人民，为实现国家在过渡时期的总任务而奋斗。
    现在，北京郊区各乡、镇都已召开了第一次乡人民代表大会或镇人民代表大会，选举了乡人民政府委员会和出席区人民代表大会的代表，讨论和布置了今年的农业生产工作和开展互助合作运动的计划。这些计划经过代表传达到选民中间后，已成为群众的实际行动。各区第一次区人民代表大会正积极进行准备工作，最近即将召开。
    会议根据选举法的精神，讨论了北京市人民代表大会代表候选人提名办法，并初步确定市人民代表大会代表名额为五百六十人。这些代表将分别由各区人民代表大会选出。根据选举法的规定，郊区每一代表所代表的人口数，应多于市区每一代表所代表的人口数。会议决定：城区各区每五千人可选出代表一名，郊区各区每六千至七千人可选出代表一名。
