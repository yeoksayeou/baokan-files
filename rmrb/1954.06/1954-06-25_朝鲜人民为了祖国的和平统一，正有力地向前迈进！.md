The Korean People Are Moving Forward Vigorously for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland!
Jin Yingji, Head of the Korean People's Delegation to China

Four years ago, on June 25th, the American imperialist aggressors provoked the most barbaric war in human history in Korea.

The Korean people, with the support and backing of all kind people in the world, defeated the foreign invaders and their lackey, the Li Chengwanz匪帮, after three years of heroic struggle, extinguishing the Korean war, which marked the focal point of international tensions.

In order to enslave the Korean people and use Korea as a springboard for aggression against China and the Soviet Union, the American imperialists did not hesitate to adopt all barbaric means, massacring many peaceful residents, and even using bacteriological weapons and various chemical weapons, in an attempt to exterminate the Korean people. The bestial atrocities of the armed aggressive forces of American imperialism deprived millions of Korean people of their homes. Many cities and villages, factories and mines, railway facilities and ports, hospitals and schools, theaters and clubs were turned into ruins. According to incomplete statistics, the people's economy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which was destroyed by the war, amounted to more than 420 billion 朝币. More than 8,700 factory buildings, 600,000 houses with a total area of 28 million square meters, 5,000 schools, 1,000 hospitals and clinics, 263 theaters and cinemas, and thousands of cultural and health care facilities were cruelly destroyed. However, these inhumane and bestial atrocities of the American imperialists failed to conquer the Korean people. Their so-called "powerful offensive," which they boasted about, repeatedly suffered shameful failures.

The Korean people, who had groaned under the 40-year rule of Japanese imperialism, are no longer willing to be slaves of the imperialists, nor will they allow anyone to undermine the free and happy life created by our people in the five years since they took control of their own government, thanks to the liberation by the great Soviet army and their selfless assistance and support. Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, their victorious organizer, and Marshal Kim Il-sung, the leader, the Korean people have strengthened their political and moral unity and strengthened their truly own armed forces - the Korean People's Army - in the fiery war.

In the Patriotic War against American imperialism and its lackey, Li Chengwanz, the Korean people have continuously received assistance from the Soviet Union, China, and various People's Democratic countries, which has not only infinitely inspired the fighting spirit of the Korean people, but also become one of the great guarantees of our victory. In particular, the fraternal Chinese people, at the most difficult time for the Korean people in October 1950, held high the banner of resisting American aggression and aiding Korea, and protecting their homes and defending their country, sending the Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of their most outstanding sons and daughters, to Korea to aid the Korean people with their blood.

After the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers fought side by side, they repelled the American imperialists by 250 kilometers to 300 kilometers in just one month, fundamentally reversing the situation of the Korean War and making it impossible for the American imperialist aggressors to reverse their fate of failure.

The brave commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers have well fulfilled the oath they made to their motherland and people, the Party and the leader: "...respect the customs and habits of the Korean people, cherish every mountain and river, every blade of grass and tree in Korea, and unite with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army to completely and thoroughly eliminate the American invading army." Therefore, our respected leader, Marshal Kim Il-sung, once said: "From the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers participating in the Korean front, we Korean people have seen the new children of the glorious People's China led by the great Chinese Communist Party and its leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, and we have seen the noble and pure new type of people who regard the difficulties and hardships of the Korean people as their own difficulties and hardships and strive to overcome these difficulties."

On the front lines, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are as close as brothers, sharing ammunition and food with each other. The commanders and fighters of the Volunteers also saved their own food to help our people who were short of food, assisted farmers who lacked labor to cultivate land and transplant seedlings, and helped farmers dig many irrigation canals and build more than 10,000 meters of flood control dikes. This is something that only an army educated in proletarian internationalist thought can do. Therefore, "The noble moral qualities displayed by the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front cannot but be a source of pride for the people of China and Korea and all those who respect human dignity." (Kim Il-sung) After the Korean armistice, the Korean people enthusiastically responded to the call of their beloved leader, Marshal Kim Il-sung, to "do everything to strengthen the democratic base and restore and develop the post-war people's economy," and devoted themselves to the work of restoration and construction with one heart and one mind. Thus, tens of thousands of new temporary houses were built in the cities and villages destroyed by the enemy, farmers scattered in the mountains and fields began to rebuild their homes, market prices were also falling, and people's lives were gradually stabilizing. Less than a week after the armistice, passenger and freight transport on important railway lines was restored. Even the Jiangxian Steel Plant and the Chengzhen Steel Plant, which the enemy claimed "had been destroyed into permanent ruins," resumed production in just over 50 days, smelting the first batch of steel and supplying a large amount of building materials needed for the restoration and construction of the Dacheng Kiln Factory, which produces 100 million bricks annually, and many other factories. In this way, after victoriously completing all the preparations for post-war restoration and construction, the entire Korean people, on the occasion of commemorating the fourth anniversary of "June 25," are contributing all their strength to the realization of the Three-Year Plan on the peaceful labor front.

According to the Three-Year Plan for the restoration and development of the people's economy after the war, by 1956, industrial production will reach 1.5 times the pre-war (1949) level, and the production of people's consumer goods will reach twice that level. From the perspective of the development prospects of each industrial sector, it is possible to completely eliminate the colonial nature of industrial production left over from the period of Japanese imperialism and lay the foundation for our country's future industrialization. In terms of the rural economy, the Three-Year Plan is of particularly great significance for the overall development of agriculture in the future. While the state strengthens its assistance and support for the development of agriculture, in order to fully meet the people's growing need for food, it will maximize the use of all arable land in the coming years, increase the yield per unit area, and increase the harvest of crops. At the same time, animal husbandry will also develop rapidly. The Three-Year Plan also stipulates that the living conditions and cultural and health conditions of the people will be improved. Within three years, the state will build houses with an area of 4.7 million square meters for urban workers. In addition, the government will extensively help farmers, providing them with state loans and building materials necessary for the restoration and construction of houses.

The Korean people are well aware that all of this is for the happiness and prosperity of the Korean people, and at the same time, it is also to lay a solid material foundation for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. Therefore, the Korean people are launching a tenacious struggle to complete and overfulfill the Three-Year Plan with the heroic spirit and creativity no less than that displayed during the war. Marshal Kim Il-sung's report at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party in March this year is the guideline and combat program for the struggle of the Korean people.

In the post-war restoration and construction, the Soviet people gave our country a huge assistance of 1 billion rubles, and the Chinese people gave our country 80,000 billion yuan (RMB), as well as the continuous assistance given to us by the people of various fraternal countries, encouraging the Korean people to establish new labor achievements, and this is also a huge guarantee for the victory of our country's construction.

The Geneva Conference, which was valued by the Korean people and the people of the world, did not achieve any results after 51 days of discussion on the Korean issue, due to the sabotage of the American representatives and their followers and their lack of sincerity in reaching an agreement. As we all know, our chief representative, Foreign Minister Nan Ri, based on the consistent desire of the Korean people, put forward various concrete proposals to promote peace and unification in Korea. The Korean people clearly recognize that the artificial division of Korea and the disasters brought to the Korean people by the three-year war were entirely caused by American imperialism. Therefore, the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea and the holding of all-Korea elections on the basis of the free expression of their will by the entire Korean people are the keys to solving the Korean issue. At this conference, the representatives of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union have consistently put forward constructive opinions and made great efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. This effort has been unanimously approved and supported by the entire Korean people and peace-loving people all over the world. However, the American representatives and their followers, with an insincere attitude and unreasonable demands, insisted that the American army continue to be stationed in South Korea, and even more absurdly advocated conducting "free" elections under the supervision of the United Nations, which had carried out a three-year war against the Korean people. The breakdown of the talks on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference nakedly exposed the conspiracy of the American ruling clique to maintain international tensions, disregard the wishes of the people of the world, and attempt to push people back into the abyss of death and disaster in front of the people of the world. This conference also reaffirmed the sincerity of the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Soviet Union in peacefully resolving the Korean issue and easing international tensions.

The fact that the negotiations on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference were broken down due to the obstruction and sabotage of American imperialism and its followers has further increased the Korean people's vigilance against American imperialism and strengthened their fighting spirit for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. The Korean people will be more united around the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and use their inexhaustible peaceful forces to defeat any conspiracy of American imperialism and its lackey, the Li Chengwanz traitorous bandits, and accomplish their great cause.

This time, our Korean People's Delegation to China, in the process of visiting and touring the great People's Republic of China for more than three months, saw the inexhaustible strength of China and how this strength is growing and expanding; at the same time, we deeply realized how much the Chinese people love the Korean people, and how powerful the strength of the unity between the Chinese and Korean people is!

The first Five-Year Plan of the People's Republic of China will not only greatly improve the material and cultural level of the people, but is also cultivating many production innovators, model workers, and a large number of political, cultural, and technical cadres. All of this has added new strength to the defense of peace in Asia and the world.

We have seen the steel-like unity of the 600 million Chinese people around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and they are moving forward vigorously for the socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of the great motherland. The powerful force of the Chinese people is capable of achieving the goals they have set, and this is a force that cannot be defeated by any aggressive force in the world. However, the American rulers do not want to recognize this great force in Asia and its great role, and even attempt to obliterate this fact. But if they continue to cling to their own opinions, then they will inevitably become more isolated in front of the people of the world, and make this policy suffer a shameful failure.

We have seen that the Chinese people are carrying out the movement to resist American aggression and aid Korea, and closely linking this movement with their own great socialist construction and continuing to deepen this movement. In many places, in order to assist the restoration and construction of the Korean people, various materials are being produced for Korea. Many workers and technicians are enthusiastically volunteering to go to Korea to help the Korean people restore and construct their homeland. Wherever we go, the Chinese people carefully inquire about the restoration situation in Korea, and even the elderly and children in China care about the lives of the Korean people as if they were their own. All of this has given us an indelible impression.

The Chinese and Korean people, taught by the Chinese Communist Party and the Korean Workers' Party armed with Marxism-Leninism, are not only connected by borders and have a long and traditional friendship, but also have forged a fraternal fighting friendship with blood in two struggles against imperialism. This brilliant friendship and strong unity is a powerful force for defending peace in the Far East and the world, and it is also the pride of the people of our two countries.

During these three months, the Korean People's Delegation to China, with the sincere care and help of the Chinese people, has successfully completed its noble mission and is about to return home. As we welcome the fourth anniversary of "June 25," and also today when the Chinese people are discussing the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China with unparalleled excitement and the political atmosphere is high, let us once again review the teachings of Marshal Kim Il-sung: "With such sincere and great friends as the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China on our side, there is no need to fear any tyrannical enemy."

    朝鲜人民为了祖国的和平统一，正有力地向前迈进！
    朝鲜人民访华代表团团长　金应基
    四年前的六月二十五日，美帝国主义侵略者在朝鲜挑起了在人类历史上空前未有的最野蛮的战争。
    朝鲜人民，在全世界所有善良人们的声援和支持下，经过三年的英勇斗争，击败了外国侵略者及其走狗李承晚匪帮，扑灭了标志着国际紧张局势焦点的朝鲜战火。
    美帝国主义者为了奴役朝鲜人民，以朝鲜作为侵略中国和苏联的跳板，不惜采取一切野蛮手段，屠杀了许多和平居民，甚至使用了细菌武器和各种化学武器，企图灭绝朝鲜人民。美帝国主义的武装侵略军队的野兽般的暴行，夺去了数百万朝鲜人民的住宅。许多城市和农村、工厂和矿山、铁路设施和港口、医院和学校、剧场和俱乐部都变成了废墟。因战争而遭到破坏的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的人民经济，据不完全统计，即达四千二百多亿元（朝币）。八千七百多座工厂建筑物、总面积达二千八百万平方公尺的六十万幢住宅、五千所学校、一千个病院和诊疗所、二百六十三个剧场和电影院，以及几千个文化卫生保健设施遭到了残酷的破坏。然而，美帝国主义者的这种灭绝人性的野兽般的暴行，并未能征服朝鲜人民。他们大言不惭吹嘘的所谓“强大攻势”，却一再遭到可耻的失败。
    曾在日本帝国主义四十年的统治下呻吟过的朝鲜人民，再不愿意当帝国主义者的奴隶，也决不允许任何人破坏我国人民由于伟大苏联军队的解放与他们无私的帮助和支持，在掌握了自己政权的五年内所创造的自由幸福生活。朝鲜人民在自己的胜利的组织者朝鲜劳动党和领袖金日成元帅的领导下，在炽烈的战火中，更加加强了自己在政治上、道德上的统一，也更加锻炼与壮大了真正是自己的武装力量——朝鲜人民军。
    在反对美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚的卫国战争中，朝鲜人民不断得到苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的援助，这不仅无限地鼓舞了朝鲜人民的斗志，同时也成为我们胜利的巨大保障之一。特别是兄弟般的中国人民，在一九五零年十月朝鲜人民处在最困难的时期，高举起抗美援朝、保家卫国的旗帜，把自己最优秀的儿女所组成的中国人民志愿军派遣到朝鲜来，以鲜血援助了朝鲜人民。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军并肩作战后，仅仅一个月的时间，就将美帝国主义者击退了二百五十公里到三百公里，根本扭转了朝鲜战争的局势，使美帝国主义侵略者再无法挽回其失败的命运。
    勇敢的中国人民志愿军指战员们，很好地履行了向祖国和人民、党和领袖所做的誓言：“……尊重朝鲜人民的风俗习惯，爱护朝鲜的一山一水、一草一木，与朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军团结一致完全彻底消灭美国侵略军。”因此，我们敬爱的领袖金日成元帅曾经说：“我们朝鲜人民从参加朝鲜战线的中国人民志愿军指战员身上，看到了伟大的中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东同志所领导的光荣的人民中国的新儿女，看到了把朝鲜人民的艰难困苦当成自己的艰难困苦并为克服这种艰难困苦而奋斗努力的崇高而纯洁的新型人物的真面貌。”
    在前线，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军亲如兄弟，他们互相分弹药使用，分粮食吃。志愿军指战员们还节约自己的食粮来帮助我国缺粮的人民，协助劳动力不足的农民耕地插秧，帮助农民挖了很多灌溉渠，修筑了一万多公尺的防洪堤。这是只有受到无产阶级国际主义思想教育的军队才能做到的事。因此，“中国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线所表现出的高贵的道德品质，不能不为朝中两国人民和所有尊重人类尊严的人们所引为骄傲的。”（金日成）朝鲜停战后，朝鲜人民热烈响应敬爱的领袖金日成元帅“一切为了加强民主基地，恢复和发展战后人民经济”的号召，万众一心奋发地投入恢复建设工作。于是，在遭到敌人破坏的城市和农村中，建筑了几万所新的临时住宅，分散在山野的农民开始重建自己的家园，市场物价也在降低，人民的生活正在逐步安定下来。停战后不到一个星期，就恢复了重要铁路干线的客运和货运。就连敌人扬言“已破坏成永久的废墟”的降仙炼钢厂和城津炼钢厂，也仅仅经过五十多天时间就恢复了生产，炼出了第一批钢，并正在供给年产一亿块砖的大成窑业工厂和其他许多工厂在恢复建设中所需要的大量建筑材料。就这样，全朝鲜人民在胜利地完成了为战后恢复建设所需的一切准备工作之后，在纪念“六·二五”四周年的今天，在和平的劳动战线上，为三年计划的实现贡献出自己所有的力量。
    根据战后人民经济恢复发展的三年计划，到一九五六年，工业生产将达到战前（一九四九年）水平的一点五倍，人民消费品的生产将达到二倍。从每个工业部门的发展前途来看，可以完全消除日本帝国主义统治时期遗留下来的工业生产中的殖民地性质，并奠定我国将来工业化的基础。农村经济方面，三年计划对农业未来的全面发展具有特别重大的意义。国家在对发展农业加强帮助和支持的同时，为了充分满足人民对粮食日益增长的需要，将在最近几年内最大限度地利用全部耕地，提高单位面积产量，以增加农作物的收获量。同时，畜牧业也将急速发展。三年计划中也规定，将改善人民的居住条件及文化卫生条件。三年内，国家将为城市工人建设面积达四百七十万平方公尺的住宅。此外，政府将广泛地帮助农民，给予他们恢复和建设住宅所必需的国家贷款和建设材料。
    朝鲜人民都很清楚地知道：所有这一切，都是为了朝鲜人民的幸福和繁荣，同时也是为了给祖国的和平统一打下坚固的物质基础。因此，朝鲜人民以不亚于战争期间所发挥的英雄气概和创造精神，为完成和超额完成三年计划而展开顽强的斗争。金日成元帅今年三月间在朝鲜劳动党中央委员会全体会议上的报告，就是朝鲜人民斗争的指针和战斗的纲领。
    战后恢复建设事业中，苏联人民给予我国十亿卢布和中国人民给予我国八万亿元（人民币）的巨大援助，以及各兄弟国家人民给予我们的不断的援助，鼓舞着朝鲜人民去建立新的劳动功绩，同时这也是我国建设胜利的巨大保证。
  　朝鲜人民以及全世界人民所重视的日内瓦会议，经过五十一天对朝鲜问题的讨论，由于美国代表及其追随者的破坏和对达成协议毫无诚意的态度，没有得到任何成就。众所周知，我国首席代表南日外务相，本着朝鲜人民始终一贯的愿望，为了促进朝鲜的和平和统一，提出了各项具体方案。朝鲜人民清楚的认识到：在朝鲜人为的分裂和三年战争给朝鲜人民带来的灾难，完全是美帝国主义造成的。因此，从朝鲜撤退外国军队和在全朝鲜人民自由表达自己的意志的基础上举行全朝鲜选举，乃是解决朝鲜问题的关键。在这个会议上，中华人民共和国代表和苏联代表始终一贯地为和平解决朝鲜问题，提出了建设性的意见，作了巨大的努力。这一努力，受到了全朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民的一致赞同和支持。然而，美国代表及其追随者却以毫无诚意的态度和无理主张，硬要使美国军队继续驻在南朝鲜，并且更荒谬地主张在对朝鲜人民进行了三年战争的联合国的监督下进行“自由”选举。日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的会谈的破裂，使美国统治集团在全世界人民面前赤裸裸地暴露了他们为了保持国际紧张局势，无视全世界人民的愿望，企图将人们重新推到死亡和灾难的深渊中去的阴谋。这次会议也再次表明了，中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国以及苏联为和平解决朝鲜问题和缓和国际紧张局势的诚意。
    日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的谈判，由于美帝国主义及其追随者的阻挠破坏而遭到破裂，这一事实更加提高了朝鲜人民对美帝国主义的警惕性，和加强了为祖国的和平统一的斗志。朝鲜人民将更加团结在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的周围，以无穷无尽的和平力量来击破美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚卖国匪帮的任何阴谋，完成自己伟大的事业。
    这一次，我们朝鲜人民访华代表团，在访问和参观伟大的中华人民共和国三个多月的过程中，看到了中国的无穷无尽的力量和这种力量是在如何地成长和壮大；同时也深深体会到，中国人民是怎样热爱朝鲜人民，以及中朝两国人民团结的力量是多么强大！
    中华人民共和国的第一个五年计划，不仅将大大提高人民的物质和文化水平，而且正在培养着许多生产革新者、劳动模范和大批的政治、文化、技术干部。这一切，为保卫亚洲与世界和平增加了新的力量。
    我们看到了六亿中国人民钢铁般的团结在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的周围，为了伟大祖国的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造事业而有力地向前迈进。中国人民的强大力量，是能够实现自己所确定的目标的，这是一支世界上任何侵略势力都不可战胜的力量。而美国统治者却不想承认亚洲这支伟大的力量及其所起的巨大作用，甚至企图抹煞这一事实。但是，如果他们继续固执己见，那么他们必定在全世界人民面前更加孤立，并且使这种政策遭到可耻的失败。
    我们看到了中国人民所进行的抗美援朝运动，并和自己伟大的社会主义建设紧密联系起来继续深入展开这一运动的情况。在许多地方，为了援助朝鲜人民的恢复建设，正在为朝鲜生产各种物资。许多工人、技术人员，为了帮助朝鲜人民恢复建设，热烈志愿赴朝。在我们所到之处，中国人民都仔细打听朝鲜的恢复情况，甚至中国的老人和儿童也像关心自己一样地关心朝鲜人民的生活。这一切都给了我们不可磨灭的印象。
    以马克思列宁主义武装起来的党——中国共产党和朝鲜劳动党所教导的中朝两国人民，不但国境相连，并具有悠久的、传统的友谊关系，而且在两度反对帝国主义斗争中以鲜血凝成了兄弟般的战斗友谊。这一灿烂的友谊和强有力的团结，是保卫远东和世界和平的强大力量、同时也是我们两国人民的骄傲。
    朝鲜人民访华代表团在这三个多月期间，在中国人民的诚挚的爱护和帮助下，胜利地完成了自己高尚的任务而要归国了。当迎接“六·二五”四周年的今天，也是中国人民以无比兴奋的心情来讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案、政治气氛昂扬的今天，让我们再一次重温金日成元帅的教导“有苏联和中华人民共和国这样的诚实的伟大友人在我们这一边，任何横暴的敌人都是不足以惧怕的”。
