    Zhejiang Cooperatives Support Farmers in Replanting Seedlings
    According to Xinhua News Agency: In May, due to excessive rainfall in some areas of Zhejiang Province, farmers urgently needed to drain water from farmland, apply topdressing fertilizer, and replant crops. The total amount of various commercial fertilizers transported by the Zhejiang Provincial Cooperative Union to various grassroots supply stations in May reached more than 20,000 tons, exceeding any previous month. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Jiaxing, Fuyang, Jinhua, Hangxian and other counties have successively supplied farmers with 150,000 pieces of various drainage equipment. In order to support farmers in timely sowing and replanting, the Zhejiang Provincial Cooperative Union has strengthened the seed allocation work of the supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties, and promptly transported 150 tons of insecticide powder to areas where insect pests occurred after the rain.

    浙江省合作社支援农民补苗
    据新华社讯：五月份，浙江省一部分地区因雨水过多，农民急需在农田排水、追肥和补种农作物，浙江省合作社联合社五月份内运往各基层供应站的各种商品肥料总数已达两万吨以上，超过了历年来的任何一个月份。嘉兴、富阳、金华、杭县等县供销合作社先后供应农民各种排水用具有十五万件。为支持农民及时播种和补种，浙江省合作社联合社已加强了对各县供销合作社的种籽调剂工作，并及时把杀虫粉一百五十吨运往雨后发生虫害的地区。
