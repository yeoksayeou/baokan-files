Talking to High School Graduates About the Characteristics and Role of Comprehensive Universities
Jiang Longji, Vice President of Peking University

Summer vacation is approaching, and the "Regulations on the National Higher Education Institutions' Summer Enrollment of New Students in 1954" issued by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government and the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government have been published in the newspapers. Every graduating high school student is considering which university to apply to, which major to choose, and which direction to develop in, in order to learn skills and serve the country's socialist construction in the future. Appropriately choosing one's university application preferences is a very important matter that relates to the individual's development prospects and the country's talent cultivation plan. To choose application preferences appropriately, one must first have a comprehensive understanding of the diverse talent needs in the country's socialist construction; second, one must have a correct understanding of the teaching content and training objectives of various types of higher education institutions and various types of majors; and then, combine one's personal interests, academic foundation, and physical condition to make careful and thorough considerations. This article intends to provide a brief introduction to the characteristics of comprehensive universities and their role in national construction, which are generally unfamiliar to high school graduates, as a reference for students in determining their application preferences.

Higher education institutions can be roughly divided into three categories: the first category is single-discipline higher education institutions, such as petroleum colleges, geology colleges, iron and steel colleges, railway colleges, water conservancy colleges, trade colleges, forestry colleges, etc.; the second category is multi-discipline higher education institutions, such as industrial universities or colleges including mechanical, electrical, civil engineering, architecture, water conservancy, etc., agricultural universities or colleges including agronomy, forestry, animal husbandry, horticulture, etc., and finance and economics universities or colleges including finance, trade, cooperation, accounting, statistics, etc.; the third category is comprehensive universities, which combine various majors in natural sciences and social sciences.

The term "comprehensive university" is rarely seen in Soviet educational literature. In the Soviet Union, all higher education institutions called "universities" are comprehensive, and all single-discipline or multi-discipline higher professional schools are called "colleges." However, in China, following past habits, there is no strict distinction between "college" and "university." In addition to the aforementioned higher education institutions including various majors in natural sciences and social sciences called universities, some multi-discipline and even single-discipline higher education institutions are also called universities (such as industrial universities, agricultural universities, medical universities, etc.). To indicate the difference between the two, the former type of university is usually called a comprehensive university, while the latter type of university is called a single-discipline or multi-discipline university.

Why do comprehensive universities combine many different types of majors in natural sciences and social sciences? This is closely related to the training objectives of comprehensive universities. The training objectives of comprehensive universities are different from those of specialized higher education institutions. Specialized higher education institutions, such as higher industrial schools, train engineers; higher agricultural schools train agricultural technicians; higher medical schools train physicians; while comprehensive universities train scientific research talents and teachers for higher education institutions or secondary schools.

Since the task of comprehensive universities is to train scientific research talents and faculty for higher education institutions and some secondary schools, their teaching requires both broad basic knowledge and in-depth professional training; both rich practical knowledge and high theoretical level. The above training objectives and teaching requirements are reflected in the teaching plans of comprehensive universities. The teaching plan of a comprehensive university first takes Marxism-Leninism, the science of the laws of natural and social development, as the common foundation of all disciplines; second, adapts to the different requirements of each major and conducts different professional education on the basis of broad basic knowledge; and then conducts specialized education on the basis of profound professional knowledge, combining all-round development and professional training to cultivate various specialized talents who can independently conduct research work and solve practical problems.

Natural sciences and social sciences develop and complement each other. An advanced natural scientist must master the knowledge of social and revolutionary development laws, and an excellent social scientist must also have rich knowledge of production struggles. Comprehensive universities closely link the various majors in natural sciences and social sciences in order to ensure that young students are trained into all-round talents with professional knowledge.

What do comprehensive universities teach and learn? All scientific knowledge, classified according to its research object, can be divided into two major categories: natural sciences and social sciences. Chairman Mao said: "Since the existence of class society, there are only two types knowledge in the world: one is called knowledge of the struggle for production, and the other is called knowledge of the class struggle. Natural sciences and social sciences are the crystallization of these two types of knowledge, and philosophy is the generalization and summary of natural and social knowledge." Classified according to the nature of science, it can be divided into theoretical or basic sciences and technical sciences. The former focuses on the exploration of basic principles, and the latter focuses on the specific application of these principles. Comprehensive universities mainly teach theoretical or basic sciences (such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geology, geography, history, economics, philosophy, law, literature, linguistics, etc.) in natural sciences and social sciences.

Then, what is the use of these theoretical or basic sciences in national construction? Everyone knows that technical sciences must be built on the foundation of theoretical or basic sciences. Without the improvement of theoretical sciences or basic sciences, technical sciences cannot be developed. Of course, the development of technical sciences will in turn promote the development of theoretical sciences. With the progress of national industrialization and the improvement of social productivity, the problems we encounter in production and construction will become more and more complex. The satisfactory resolution of these problems depends on the improvement of the level of scientific research, and the improvement of the level of scientific research depends on the development of theoretical or basic sciences. Therefore, production practice, technical sciences, and basic sciences influence and develop each other. The view that only emphasizes technical sciences and does not emphasize basic sciences is wrong.

For example, in order to carry out national construction on a large scale and to realize national industrialization, the exploration of natural resources is the primary task, and resource exploration requires the cooperation of geography, geology, soil science, meteorology, zoology, botany, economics, and other fields.

Physics is closely related to many aspects of technology, such as mining, metallurgy, machinery, electricity, telecommunications, civil engineering, water conservancy, transportation, military, medicine, and agriculture. As for nuclear physics, it can open up new power resources, and the utilization of atomic energy will cause tremendous changes in production and construction. Mathematics is the foundation of natural sciences and technology, and mechanics, physics, architecture, etc. all depend on the development of mathematics. The smelting of steel and non-ferrous metals, the utilization of fuels such as coal and petroleum, industrial materials such as rubber, plastics, artificial fibers, dyes, explosives, and the manufacture of artificial fertilizers and various drugs depend on the development of chemistry.

The increase in agricultural and animal husbandry production and the improvement of product quality cannot be separated from Michurin's biology, Pavlov's physiology, and Williams' soil science. The development of health care is inseparable from Pavlov's physiology and Lepeshinskaya's theory of living matter. The achievements of advanced Soviet science in these areas have made extremely great contributions to human happiness.

In terms of social sciences, social sciences guided by Marxism-Leninism are the ideological weapon for the working class to lead the people in achieving victory in revolutionary struggles and construction endeavors. Lenin once instructed us: "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement." Once revolutionary theory is grasped by the masses of the people, it will become a material force and will play a huge role in revolution and construction.

Marxist-Leninist philosophy—dialectical materialism and historical materialism—is the world outlook and theoretical foundation of the working-class party. It is the most fundamental and correct scientific viewpoint and method for studying all laws of natural and social development, and it is the ideological weapon for transforming the world by revolutionary means.

Political economy is the science of studying the laws of development of production relations and the laws of social development. The working-class party formulates its program and policies and carries out practical activities based on the laws of production development and the laws of social and economic development. The general task of the country's transition period put forward by our party is primarily based on the Marxist-Leninist political economy theory on the transition period.

History is the scientific study of past human society and its development process. China has a history of five thousand years, full of the diverse creations, moving struggles, and rich life experiences of the working people. Chairman Mao taught us: "From Confucius to Sun Yat-sen, we should summarize and inherit this precious heritage. This is of great help in guiding the current great movement."

As for language and literature, they are indispensable weapons for disseminating revolutionary ideas, improving people's culture, enlightening people's consciousness, and fighting against class enemies. Therefore, language and literature are also very important for national construction and people's lives.

From the above examples, it is obvious that the theory or basic sciences occupy an important position in national construction and people's lives, and the task undertaken by comprehensive universities is to cultivate specialized talents for scientific research and teaching work through the teaching of theoretical or basic sciences (including natural sciences and social sciences).

Since the scientific research personnel of scientific research institutions and the faculty of higher education institutions and some secondary schools all rely on comprehensive universities for cultivation, the quality of comprehensive universities has a very significant impact on the development of higher education and scientific research, and on whether the country's scientific theory and cultural level can be improved. Therefore, it is said that "comprehensive universities are the foundation of various specialized higher education institutions and various scientific research institutions," and "comprehensive universities are an important symbol of the country's cultural and scientific development."

Our country was built on the ruins of a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, and the backwardness of culture and science has its historical and social roots. However, after the victory of the people's democratic revolution, the people's political consciousness has risen unprecedentedly, and various production undertakings have developed rapidly. With the development of politics and economy, the level of culture and science is also improving accordingly. Especially after the country enters large-scale economic construction, the increasingly huge production construction and the increasingly improved people's lives will raise more and more complex theoretical and practical problems that require scientific workers to solve. This requires developing and running comprehensive universities well in order to cultivate more and better scientific research talents and teachers for universities and middle schools to serve the socialist construction of the motherland.

    和高中毕业同学谈谈综合大学的特点和作用
    北京大学副校长　江隆基
    暑假快到了，中央人民政府高等教育部和中央人民政府教育部“关于全国高等学校一九五四年暑期招考新生的规定”已经在报纸上公布。每一位即将毕业的高中同学都在考虑自己究竟应该投考那一个大学、选择那一个专业，向那一个方向发展，以便学好本领，将来好替祖国的社会主义建设服务。高中毕业同学适当地选择自己的升学志愿，是关系着个人发展前途，也关系着国家培养人才计划的一件十分重要的事。要把升学志愿选择得恰当，首先必须对祖国社会主义建设中多种多样的人才需要有全面的认识；其次要对各种不同类型的高等学校及各种不同性质的专业的教学内容和培养目标，有正确的了解；然后再结合自己的个人志趣、学业基础及身体条件去慎重周详地考虑。本文就准备将一般高中毕业同学所不甚熟悉的综合大学的特点及其在国家建设中的作用，做一个简括的介绍，作为同学们在确定自己升学志愿时的参考。
    高等学校大致可分为三类：第一类是单科性的高等学校，例如石油学院、地质学院、钢铁学院、铁道学院、水利学院、贸易学院、林学院等；第二类是多科性的高等学校，例如包括机械、电机、土木、建筑、水利等科的工业大学或工学院，包括农学、林学、畜牧、园艺等科的农业大学或农学院，包括财政、贸易、合作、会计、统计等科的财经大学或财经学院；第三类是综合性大学，即将自然科学和社会科学各专业联结在一起的大学。
    “综合大学”这个名称在苏联的教育文献上是不多见的。在苏联，凡称做“大学”的高等学校都是综合性的，一切单科性或多科性的高等专业学校都称为“学院”。但在中国，沿袭着过去的习惯，“学院”和“大学”没有严格的区别，除上述包括自然科学和社会科学各专业的高等学校称之为大学外，有些多科性乃至单科性的高等学校也称为大学（如工业大学、农业大学、医科大学等）。为了表示两者的区别，通常将前一种大学叫做综合性大学，而将后一种大学叫做单科性或多科性的大学。
    综合大学为什么要将自然科学方面和社会科学方面许多不同性质的专业联结在一起呢？这和综合大学的培养目标有着密切的关系。综合大学的培养目标和专科性的高等学校有所不同，专科性的高等学校，例如高等工业学校培养工程师，高等农业学校培养农业技师，高等医科学校培养医师，而综合大学则培养科学研究人才和高等学校或中等学校的教师。
    综合大学的任务既是培养科学研究人才和高等学校及部分中等学校的师资，所以它在教学上既要求有广阔的基础知识，又要求有深入的专业训练；既要求有丰富的实际知识，又要求有较高的理论水平。上述的培养目标和教学要求体现在综合大学的教学计划当中。综合大学的教学计划首先是以马克思列宁主义关于自然和社会发展规律的科学作为一切学科的共同基础；其次是适应各个专业的不同要求，在广阔的基础知识之上进行不同的专业教育；再在深厚的专业知识的基础之上进行专门化的教育，使全面发展和专业训练相结合，以培养出能独立进行研究工作，并能解决实际问题的各种专门人才。
    自然科学和社会科学是互相发展互相补充的。一个先进的自然科学家必须掌握社会发展规律和革命发展规律的知识，而一个优秀的社会科学家也必须有丰富的生产斗争知识。综合大学把自然科学各专业和社会科学各专业紧密地联系起来，这就是为了保证把青年学生培养成为全面发展而又有专业知识的人才。
    综合大学教些什么、学些什么呢？一切科学知识，按其研究对象来划分，可分为自然科学和社会科学两大类。毛主席说：“自从有阶级的社会存在以来，世界上的知识只有两门，一门叫做生产斗争知识，一门叫做阶级斗争知识。自然科学、社会科学，就是这两门知识的结晶，哲学则是关于自然知识和社会知识的概括和总结。”如按科学的性质来划分，又可分为理论或基础科学和技术科学两大类。前者着重于基本原理、原则的探讨，后者则着重于这些原理、原则的具体运用。综合大学就是以自然科学和社会科学方面的理论或基础科学（如数学、物理学、化学、生物学、地质学、地理学、历史学、经济学、哲学、法律、文学、语言学等）为其主要的教学内容的。
    那么，这些理论或基础科学在国家建设中究竟有什么用处呢？大家都知道，技术科学必须建筑在理论或基础科学的基础之上，如果没有理论科学或基础科学的提高，技术科学是不可能得到发展的。当然，技术科学的发展也会反过来促进理论科学的发展。随着国家工业化的进展和社会生产力的提高，我们在生产建设中所碰到的问题将会愈来愈复杂。这些问题的圆满解决有赖于科学研究水平的提高，而科学研究水平的提高则有赖于理论或基础科学的发展。所以生产实践、技术科学、基础科学是互为影响，互相发展的，只重视技术科学，而不重视基础科学的观点是错误的。
    举例来说，为了大规模地开展国家建设，为了实现国家的工业化，自然资源的勘查就是首要的任务，而资源勘查就需要地理学、地质学、土壤学、气象学、动物学、植物学、经济学等方面的合作。
    物理学对多方面的技术，如采矿、冶金、机械、电力、电讯、土木、水利、交通、军事、医药、农业都有着密切关系。至于原子核物理更可以开辟新的动力资源，原子能的利用将引起生产建设上的巨大变革。数学是自然科学及技术的基础，力学、物理学、建筑学等都有赖于数学的发展。钢铁和有色金属的冶炼，煤和石油等燃料的利用，橡胶、塑料、人造纤维、染料、炸药等工业材料以及人造肥料和各种药物的制造，则有赖于化学的发展。
    农牧业的增产和产品质量的提高，离不了米丘林的生物学、巴甫洛夫生理学和威廉姆士的土壤学。保健事业的发展离不开巴甫洛夫的生理学和勒柏辛斯卡娅的活质学说。苏联先进科学在这些方面的成就对于人类的幸福有着极其伟大的贡献。
    再就社会科学方面来说，以马克思列宁主义思想为指导的社会科学是工人阶级领导人民大众在革命斗争和建设事业中取得胜利的思想武器。列宁曾指示过我们：“没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动。”革命的理论一旦掌握了人民大众，就会变成一种物质的力量，就会在革命和建设中发挥巨大的作用。
    马克思列宁主义哲学—辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义是工人阶级政党的世界观和理论基础，是研究一切自然发展规律和社会发展规律的最根本的也是最正确的科学观点和方法，是用革命手段改造世界的思想武器。
    政治经济学是研究生产关系发展规律、社会发展规律的科学，而工人阶级政党在制定自己的纲领政策以及进行实际活动时就是以生产发展的规律和社会经济发展的规律为出发点的。我们党所提出的国家过渡时期的总任务首先就是以马克思列宁主义政治经济学关于过渡时期的理论为依据的。
    历史学是对于过去人类社会及其发展过程的科学研究。中国有五千年的历史，充满了劳动人民多种多样的创造、可歌可泣的斗争和丰富无比的生活经验。毛主席教导我们：“从孔夫子到孙中山，我们应当给以总结，承继这一份珍贵的遗产。这对于指导当前的伟大运动，是有重要的帮助的。”
    至于语言文学则是传播革命思想、提高人民文化、启发人民觉悟并和阶级敌人作斗争的、必不可少的利器。所以语言文学对于国家建设和人民生活也是十分重要的。
    从以上的举例说明中，显然可以看出理论或基础科学在国家建设和人民生活中所占的重要地位，而综合大学所担负的任务就是通过理论或基础科学（包括自然科学和社会科学）的教学来培养科学研究工作和教学工作的专门人才。
    既然科学研究机构的科学研究人员和高等学校及部分中等学校的师资都要靠综合大学来培养，那么，综合大学办得好坏，对于高等教育事业和科学研究事业的能否发展，对于国家的科学理论和文化水平的能否提高，就有着极为重大的影响。所以说，“综合大学是各种专科性的高等学校和各种科学研究机构的基础”，“综合大学是国家文化和科学发展的一个重要标志”。
    我们的国家是在半封建半殖民地的废墟上建立起来的，文化科学的落后现象有其历史的和社会的根源。但在人民民主革命取得胜利以后，人民的政治觉悟空前地高涨，各项生产事业飞速地发展。随着政治和经济的发展，文化科学的水平也在相应地提高。特别是在国家进入大规模的经济建设以后，日益巨大的生产建设和日益提高的人民生活将提出更多更复杂的理论问题和实际问题要求科学工作者来解决，这就必须发展并办好综合大学，以培养更多更好的科学研究人才和大、中学校的师资去为祖国的社会主义建设服务。
