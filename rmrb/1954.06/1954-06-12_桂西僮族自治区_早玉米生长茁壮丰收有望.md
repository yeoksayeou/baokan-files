Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region

Early Maize Growing Vigorously, Good Harvest Expected

The early maize in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Guangxi Province, is growing vigorously, and a good harvest is expected. Early maize is one of the main grains of the autonomous region. This spring, the area suffered a prolonged drought and insect plagues. Under the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, farmers of all ethnic groups vigorously fought the drought, rushed to plant, and promptly planted maize. Counties such as Yongning, Wuming, and Binyang have also universally launched insect extermination campaigns. Farmers in Xiong?? Township, Wuming County, mobilized day and night to eliminate insects, catching more than 150,000 rice borers in six days, saving more than 2,100 mu of maize fields. Farmers in various places are also actively hunting beasts. The Zhou Yongning mutual aid group in Xinlong Township, Fusu county, led the villagers to organize three iron trap beast prevention groups, which killed five wild boars and other wild animals in twenty days, protecting the growth of maize seedlings. Farmers of all ethnic groups have also improved their cultivation techniques. In the past, maize fields were generally cultivated only twice and fertilized once, but this year they have generally been cultivated three times and fertilized two to three times. In Wuming County, an average of about 13 dan of fertilizer was applied per mu of maize field. Now the maize stalks have grown to four or five feet high, and it is expected that they can be harvested in mid-June. (Xinhua News Agency)

    早玉米生长茁壮丰收有望
    广西省桂西僮族自治区早玉米生长茁壮，丰收在望。早玉米是自治区主要粮食之一。今春这个地区久旱无雨，又遭虫灾。各族农民在互助合作组织的带动下，大力抗旱抢种，及时种上玉米。邕宁、武鸣、宾阳等县并普遍展开了除虫运动。武鸣县雄?乡农民日夜出动除虫，六天内就捉了十五万多只螟虫，抢救了二千一百多亩玉米田。各地农民并积极打兽。扶绥县新隆乡周永宁互助组带动本村群众组织了三个铁铗防兽组，二十天内就打了五只山猪和其他野兽，保卫了玉米禾苗的生长。各族农民还改进了耕作技术。过去玉米地一般只中耕二次、追肥一次，今年普遍做到了中耕三次、追肥二次到三次。武鸣县玉米地平均每亩约施了十三担肥料，现在玉米秆已长到四五尺高，预计六月中旬即可收割。　　（新华社）
