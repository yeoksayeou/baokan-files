    Why is the Wheat at Lutai Farm Growing So Well?
    The wheat at the state-run Lutai Farm is currently in its flowering period. The more than 6,000 mu of wheat fields look like a flat, green carpet from a distance.
    A bumper harvest is expected for the entire farm this year. By adopting the advanced Soviet agricultural science experience, deep plowing (averaging 22 cm deep) and close planting were implemented, with a row spacing of 15 cm and a seeding rate of 22 jin per mu. Currently, the average number of effective plants per mu is about 400,000, with some reaching 1 million. Although the number of plants is high, the wheat ears are still growing robustly and uniformly, with an average of about 20 grains per ear. This creates the main conditions for large-scale high yields. Due to the implementation of mechanized farming, timely sowing can be ensured, and the seedlings grow exceptionally strong. For example, the 2,000 mu of wheat sown before the Autumn Equinox by the First Workstation is the best wheat on the entire farm, estimated to yield more than 250 jin per mu. To preserve moisture and keep the soil warm, winter irrigation was carried out last year, and the land was harrowed with short spike-tooth harrows this spring. This increased the tillering rate. To ensure that the wheat received sufficient moisture, shallow water irrigation was carried out before heading, and small amounts of water were used to irrigate the less moist hills during flowering.
    Currently, the combine harvester operators and repair technicians of the mechanized farming team are preparing for the wheat harvest.

### 芦台农场小麦为什么长的好

    芦台农场小麦为什么长的好
    国营芦台农场的小麦，正值扬花时期，六千多亩麦田，从远望去，好像平铺着一幅绿油油的毡毯。
    今年全场的小麦，可望丰收。由于接受了苏联先进的农业科学经验，实行了深耕（耕深均达二十二公分）密植，采取了十五公分的行距，每亩播种量二十二斤，现在一般的每亩有效株数达四十万株左右，多的达一百万株，株数虽然多，麦穗也还是长的茁壮整齐，每穗平均在二十粒左右，这就给大面积丰产创造了主要的条件。由于实行了机械耕作，能掌握适期播种，禾苗就长得分外茁壮，如第一工作站在秋分前播种的小麦二千亩，为全场最好的小麦，估计每亩可收二百五十斤以上，为了保墒、保温，去年进行了冬灌，今春又用短钉齿耙耙地，这样增加了分蘖率，为了使小麦得到足够的水分，孕穗前进行了浅水灌溉，并在扬花时选择水分比较少的丘，用小水灌溉。
    目前，机械耕作队的联合收割机手和修理技工们，正在进行麦收前的准备工作。
