    The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League on Several Specific Issues Regarding the Constitution of the Young Pioneers of China

    I. Regarding Young Pioneers:

    (I) Regarding the procedures for joining the Pioneers, the original draft of the Constitution stated that "approval by the Young Pioneers detachment headquarters is sufficient to become a member." This is now changed to "one can apply to the squadron committee, and after discussion and approval by the squadron committee, one becomes a member." This is because squadrons are usually formed based on classes, and the young children are relatively familiar with and understand each other. It is more appropriate for the squadron committee to discuss and approve members. If the admission of members had to be approved by the brigade committee, the brigade committee would be overburdened, which is practically infeasible.

    (II) Two clauses have been added: "Every member has the right to elect and be elected, and can offer opinions and requests regarding the work and activities of the detachment." and "The Young Pioneers require every member to study hard, exercise, abide by discipline, be united and friendly, love labor, actively participate in detachment activities, obey the detachment's resolutions, and strive to do well in the work assigned by the detachment." This is to better cultivate the initiative, creativity, and collectivist spirit of young children. Making demands on members is also education, and the Young Pioneers organization and instructors should educate and help each member to strive to meet these requirements.

    II. Regarding the Organization of the Young Pioneers:

    (I) Based on practical experience, schools and educational institutions for young children are places where young children are concentrated for education, and the Young Pioneers should be established first in schools and educational institutions for young children. For some members in rural and urban areas who have graduated from primary and junior high schools but have not continued their education, the local Communist Youth League committees should organize and lead them according to their specific environment and conditions.

    (II) The organization of the detachment is divided into brigades, squadrons, and teams. A team consists of seven to thirteen members, a squadron consists of two to five teams, and a brigade consists of two or more squadrons. This avoids organizational overlap and too many levels, allowing organizations at all levels to play their full role. At the same time, a squadron is composed of a class or two adjacent classes, and the members are similar in age and level of cultural knowledge, eliminating the need to divide them into junior and senior groups according to age.

    (III) The organizational structure of squadrons and brigades will be changed to a committee system, which is more conducive to cultivating the collective democratic style of young children.

    III. Regarding the Emblems, Salutes, and Slogans of the Young Pioneers:

    The emblems, salutes, and slogans of the Young Pioneers were officially announced and implemented in April 1950. Now they are stipulated in the Constitution so that young children can better understand their meaning, in order to cultivate young children's organizational skills, discipline, and lofty feelings for the collective.

    The meaning of the salute cancels the originally stipulated items 2 and 3, and the slogan has been modified to make the content simple and clear, making it easy for members to remember.

    青年团中央关于中国少年先锋队队章的几个具体问题的说明
    一、关于少年先锋队队员：
    （一）在入队手续上，将原队章草案上规定的“经少年儿童队队部批准，就可成为队员”改为“可以向中队委员会提出申请，经过中队委员会讨论批准后，就成为队员”。这是因为中队通常是以班级为单位组成的，少年儿童彼此比较熟悉了解，由中队委员会来讨论和批准队员比较适当。如果吸收队员要经过大队委员会批准，大队委员会就会负担太重，实际上是行不通的。
    （二）增加了两条：“每个队员有选举权和被选举权，可以对队的工作和活动提出意见和要求。”和“少年先锋队要求每个队员好好学习，锻炼身体，遵守纪律，团结友爱，爱好劳动，积极参加队的活动，服从队的决议，努力做好队交给的工作。”这是为了更好地培养少年儿童的主动性、创造性和集体主义精神。对队员提出要求也就是教育，少年先锋队组织和辅导员应该教育和帮助每个队员努力做到这些要求。
    二、关于少年先锋队的组织：
      （一）根据实际工作的经验，学校和少年儿童教养机关是少年儿童集中受教育的地方，少年先锋队应该首先在学校和少年儿童教养机关中建立。对于目前在农村和城市中的一部分小学和初中毕业而没有升学的队员，各地团委应该根据他们所处的具体环境和条件，予以组织和领导。
      （二）队的组织分大队、中队、小队。小队由七人到十三人组成，中队由两个到五个小队组成，大队由两个以上中队组成。这样可以避免组织重叠，层次太多，使各级组织都能充分发挥作用。同时一个中队都是由一个班级或者相近的两个班级组成，队员在年龄和文化知识水平上都比较近似，不必再按年龄分少年组和儿童组。
    （三）中队和大队的组织机构改用委员会制，这样更便于养成少年儿童的集体的民主作风。
    三、关于少年先锋队的标志、队礼和呼号：
    少年先锋队的标志、队礼和呼号已经在一九五○年四月正式公布施行。现在把它们规定在队章上，使少年儿童更好地了解它的意义，以培养少年儿童的组织性、纪律性和对集体的崇高的感情。
    队礼的意义取消了原来规定的二、三两条，呼号作了修改，使内容简单明确，队员容易记忆。
