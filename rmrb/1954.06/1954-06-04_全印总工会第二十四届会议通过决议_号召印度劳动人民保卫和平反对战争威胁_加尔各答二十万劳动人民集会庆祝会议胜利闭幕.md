Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 1st dispatch: The General Secretary of the All-India Trade Union Congress, Dange, delivered a summary report at the 24th session of the All-India Trade Union Congress held in late May, and the meeting passed a resolution to fight for peace.

　　When discussing the international situation, Dange emphasized the importance of striving for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Asian territories, opposing the US-Pakistan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," striving for friendship between the peoples of Pakistan and India, strengthening international cooperation among the working classes of all countries, and striving for friendship and trade with the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries. While condemning the aggressive US-Pakistan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," Dange said: This agreement, which serves as a tool for aggression against neighboring countries and the enslavement of the Pakistani people, must not be allowed to achieve its goals. Dange also expressed support for the struggle of residents in Pondicherry, Goa, and other places under French and Portuguese rule to fight for liberation.

　　The resolution on fighting for peace, unanimously adopted by the meeting, stated: The All-India Trade Union Congress believes that the task of fighting for peace is the primary task of the Indian working class and an indispensable part of its struggle to improve living and working conditions, to fight for trade union rights and democratic freedoms, and for complete national independence.

　　The resolution emphasized that the United States, fearing the prospects of consolidating peace and easing international tensions brought about by the conclusion of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the convening of the Geneva Conference, is attempting to obstruct the achievement of an agreement at the Geneva Conference and is constantly taking new provocative actions and strengthening military measures.

　　The resolution concluded by saying that the All-India Trade Union Congress calls on the Indian working people, especially the trade unions affiliated with the All-India Trade Union Congress, to unite and cooperate with the peace movement in order to unite an increasingly broad spectrum of people and mobilize them to defend peace and oppose the threat of war.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: TASS, Calcutta, 31st dispatch: The working people of Calcutta held a demonstration parade on May 30th to celebrate the victorious conclusion of the 24th session of the All-India Trade Union Congress. Leading the parade was a mixed workers' band. The residents of Calcutta warmly welcomed the parade. As the paraders passed the US Information Service building in Calcutta, they shouted slogans such as "Get out of Asia!"
　　"Down with US imperialism!" "Down with the US-Pakistan Military Agreement!" "Long live peace in Korea and Indochina!" "Long live world peace!"

　　At 6 p.m., a rally of 200,000 working people was held in Calcutta's Central Square. Prominent trade union and political activists Ranan Sen, Satyapriya Banerjee, and Mirajkar delivered speeches at the rally, calling on the working class to strengthen unity and fight for better living conditions, for peace, and for national independence.

　　When the General Secretary of the All-India Trade Union Congress, Dange, appeared on the stage, the attendees responded with a storm of applause and shouted: "Long live the All-India Trade Union Congress!" "Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions!"

　　The meeting unanimously endorsed the resolutions of the 24th session of the All-India Trade Union Congress. The attendees welcomed with warm applause the congratulatory telegrams from the World Federation of Trade Unions, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, and fraternal trade unions from China and other countries.

　　The meeting concluded with three loud shouts of: "Long live the great unity of trade unions!" A grand carnival was held after the meeting.

    据新华社新德里一日电：全印总工会总书记丹吉在五月下旬举行的全印总工会第二十四届会议上作了总结报告，会议并通过了一项为和平而斗争的决议。
    丹吉在谈到国际形势时着重指出争取从亚洲领土上撤退一切外国军队，反对美巴“共同防御援助协定”，争取巴基斯坦和印度两国人民的友好，加强各国工人阶级的国际合作，争取与苏联、中国及各人民民主国家的友好和进行贸易的重要性。丹吉在谴责侵略性的美巴“共同防御援助协定”时说：不能让作为侵略邻国和奴役巴基斯坦人民的工具的这一协定达到它的目的。丹吉并表示支持本地治里、果阿等地的居民在法国和葡萄牙统治下争取解放的斗争。
    会议一致通过的关于为和平而斗争的决议说：全印总工会认为，为和平而斗争的任务是印度工人阶级主要的任务，而且是它争取改善生活和劳动条件、争取工会权利及民主自由和民族完全独立的斗争中不可缺少的部分。
    决议着重指出，美国惧怕由于朝鲜停战协定的缔结和日内瓦会议的召开而出现的巩固和平与缓和国际紧张局势的前景，因而企图阻挠在日内瓦会议上达成协议，并不断采取新的挑衅行为和加强军事措施。
    决议最后说，全印总工会号召印度劳动人民、特别是加入全印总工会的各工会团结起来，与和平运动进行合作，以联合越来越广泛的各阶层民众，动员他们保卫和平、反对战争威胁。
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社加尔各答五月三十一日讯：加尔各答劳动人民在五月三十日举行示威游行庆祝全印总工会第二十四届会议的胜利闭幕。走在游行队伍最前面的是工人混合乐队。加尔各答居民热烈地欢迎游行队伍。参加游行的人在行经驻加尔各答的美国新闻处大楼时，高呼“滚出亚洲！”
  “打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒美巴军事协定！”“朝鲜和印度支那和平万岁！”“世界和平万岁！”等口号。
    下午六时，加尔各答中央广场上举行了二十万劳动人民的大会。著名的工会和政治活动家拉南·塞恩、萨蒂亚普里雅·班纳吉和密拉志卡尔等人在大会上发表了演说，号召工人阶级加强团结，为美好的生活条件，为和平和民族独立而斗争。
    当全印总工会总书记丹吉在讲台上出现时，到会者报以暴风雨般的掌声，并高呼：“全印总工会万岁！”“世界工会联合会万岁！”
    大会一致拥护全印总工会第二十四届会议的决议。到会者以热烈的掌声欢迎世界工会联合会、全苏工会中央理事会以及中国和其他国家的兄弟工会的贺电。
    大会最后三次高呼：“工会大团结万岁！”会后还举行了盛大的游艺会。
