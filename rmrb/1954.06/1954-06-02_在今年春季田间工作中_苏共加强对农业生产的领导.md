Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: According to Soviet newspapers, the Soviet Communist Party has universally strengthened its leadership over agricultural production and mass political work during this year's spring field work. In order to strengthen the leadership over agricultural production, the Party organizations of Gorky Oblast have dispatched 345 leading Party and Soviet workers since this spring to serve as secretaries of agricultural district Party committees, chairmen of district Soviet executive committees, and secretaries of Party organizations of machine tractor stations and chairmen of collective farms. The Party organizations of Altai Krai pay great attention to strengthening the cadre lineup of tractor teams, which are of decisive significance to agricultural production. More than 4,000 Communist Party members and alternate members have been assigned to tractor teams in various places, and Party groups have been established in 329 tractor teams. During the spring sowing period, the Chita Oblast Party Committee sent about 200 Party and Soviet workers from the oblast center to machine tractor stations and collective farms to specifically help rural Party organizations carry out mass political work. Rural Party organizations in various places attach great importance to promoting advanced production experiences and publicizing the Party's policies to agricultural workers. The Plegistskinsky District Party Committee of Yaroslavl Oblast and the Party organizations of collective farms and machine tractor stations have set up "production indicator boards" and "honor rolls" in various tractor teams and field work teams, and published a "combat newspaper" specializing in promoting advanced production experiences. These measures have greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of machine operators and collective farmers, making production competitions between teams and between collective farms very heated. The Mikhailovsky District Party Committee of Altai Krai has established 38 field propaganda stations in various collective farms, sending 80 Party propagandists to go deep into the fields to publicize the Party's policies and promote advanced experiences. The district Party committee also sent 12 speakers to give nearly 100 reports to machine operators and collective farmers in 20 days. These reports were all related to the actual production situation in the district and in various tractor teams and field work teams. In addition, "combat newspapers" were published in various teams to promote the experiences of advanced producers and promptly expose shortcomings in the work. As a result, the labor discipline of the machine tractor stations and collective farms in Mikhailovsky District has been greatly consolidated in this year's spring production, and labor productivity has also been greatly improved. Many advanced tractor teams and field work teams have continuously overfulfilled their work quotas and completed their spring sowing and reclamation plans ahead of schedule. By the end of May, the district had reclaimed more than 11,000 hectares (each hectare is equal to 15 mu) of virgin and fallow land, and sown seeds on these new lands, 4,000 hectares more than the original plan.

    在今年春季田间工作中
    苏共加强对农业生产的领导
    【新华社一日讯】据苏联报纸消息：苏联共产党在今年春季田间工作中普遍加强了对农业生产的领导和群众政治工作。高尔基州的党组织为了加强对农业生产的领导，今年春季以来已派遣了三百四十五个党的领导工作人员和苏维埃工作人员，到农村担任农业区区党委书记、区苏维埃执行委员会主席，以及机器拖拉机站党组织书记和集体农庄主席。阿尔泰边疆区的党组织非常注意加强对农业生产有决定意义的拖拉机队的干部阵容。各地共为拖拉机队配备了四千多个共产党员和候补党员，在三百二十九个拖拉机队中建立了党小组。赤塔州党委会在春播期间从州中心向机器拖拉机站和集体农庄派出了约二百个党和苏维埃工作人员，具体帮助农村党组织开展群众政治工作。各地农村党组织很重视向农业劳动者推广先进生产经验和宣传党的各项政策。雅罗斯拉夫州普列吉斯金斯克区党委会和集体农庄及机器拖拉机站的党组织，在各拖拉机队和田间工作队中设置了“生产指标牌”和“光荣榜”，并出版了专门推广先进生产经验的“战斗报”。这些措施大大鼓舞了机器操使者和集体农民的劳动热情，使队与队之间、集体农庄与集体农庄之间的生产竞赛开展得很热烈。阿尔泰边疆区米哈伊洛夫区党委会在各集体农庄成立了三十八个田间宣传站，派出八十个党的宣传员深入田间宣传党的政策和推广先进经验。区党委会还派了十二个报告员，在二十天内为机器操使者和集体农民作了近一百次报告，这些报告都能联系本区和各拖拉机队及田间工作队的实际的生产情况。此外，在各队中还出版了“战斗报”，宣传先进生产者的经验，并及时揭露工作中存在的缺点。结果米哈伊洛夫区的机器拖拉机站和集体农庄的劳动纪律在今年春季生产中已大大巩固，劳动生产率也大大提高了。许多先进拖拉机队和田间工作队不断超额完成工作定额，提前完成了春播和开垦计划。到五月下旬，该区已开垦了一万一千多公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）生荒地和熟荒地，并在这些新地上播了种，比原订计划多四千公顷。
