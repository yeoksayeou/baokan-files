    Spring cocoons in the East China region are entering the market successively. Spring cocoons from Shengxian, Shaoxing, Zhuji, and other counties in Zhejiang Province already appeared on the market in late May. Trade departments in Suzhou and Zhenjiang Special Districts in Jiangsu Province, as well as cocoon-producing counties in Shandong and Anhui provinces, began purchasing spring cocoons in early June.
    The East China region is the main cocoon-producing area in the country, with silk production accounting for more than 60% of the national total. This year's spring cocoon production in the East China region is generally good, with an estimated yield of over 50 catties of cocoons per silkworm egg sheet. In Shengxian, Xinchang, and other places in Zhejiang Province, the output of spring cocoons has increased by 5% to 10% compared to last year.
