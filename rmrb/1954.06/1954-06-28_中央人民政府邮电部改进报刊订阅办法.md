    Central People's Government Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Improves Newspaper and Magazine Subscription Methods
    In order to make it more convenient for readers to subscribe to newspapers and magazines, the Central People's Government Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has further improved the national newspaper and magazine subscription methods. The improved methods are as follows: (1) Newspapers can be subscribed to on a monthly basis, and magazines can be subscribed to on a quarterly basis. Those who wish to subscribe for more than one month or one quarter can do so, but subscriptions must end at the end of the month or the end of the year. (2) If it is not possible to subscribe to newspapers on a monthly basis or magazines on a quarterly basis, or if the subscription date has been missed, subscriptions can be made to the local post office at any time, but the subscription must start regularly depending on the distance of the postal route, and end at the end of the month or quarter. (3) For organizations, troops, groups, basic construction sites, etc. subscribing to newspapers and magazines, in special circumstances, subscriptions can start and end at any time, and do not necessarily have to end at the end of the month or quarter. (4) The time for readers to subscribe to newspapers and magazines at the post office: for newspapers, from the first day of the month preceding the month of publication; for magazines, from the second month of the previous quarter. The deadline for post offices to accept subscriptions should be separately stipulated by the local post offices according to the postal route from the place of publication of the newspapers and magazines and the internal processing of the post office, and should be announced to the readers, and should not be arbitrarily advanced.
    The Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has instructed postal bureaus at all levels to implement the above improved methods conscientiously.
