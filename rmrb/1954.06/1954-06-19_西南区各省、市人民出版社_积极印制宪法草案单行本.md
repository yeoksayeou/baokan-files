People's Publishing Houses and Xinhua Bookstores in provinces and cities of Southwest China, in order to timely meet the needs of the people in the Southwest region for discussing the Draft Constitution, have decided that the People's Publishing Houses in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang and other places will be responsible for printing the Draft Constitution as a separate publication, which will be distributed by local Xinhua Bookstores. To this end, the News and Publication Bureau of the Southwest Administrative Committee convened a meeting of printing, publishing, and distribution units under its jurisdiction to study and urge all parties to do this work well.

The Southwest General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore and the News and Publication Offices of the Sichuan and Guizhou Provincial People's Governments have also held meetings separately to study and arrange distribution methods. The Southwest General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore has also compiled a catalog of reference books related to the discussion of the Draft Constitution for readers to refer to when purchasing and discussing. In addition, a slideshow for distributing the Draft Constitution has been made and distributed to various places for screening.

In order to strengthen postal delivery, the Southwest Postal and Telecommunications Administration has decided to send postal packages containing the Draft Constitution as express mail in order to shorten the distribution time. The News and Publication Office of the Sichuan Provincial People's Government and the Sichuan Branch of Xinhua Bookstore have decided to organize inspection teams to conduct key inspections during the distribution of the Draft Constitution and assist county branches in doing a good job in distribution.

    西南区各省、市人民出版社
    积极印制宪法草案单行本
    西南区各省、市人民出版社和新华书店为了及时配合西南地区人民群众对宪法草案讨论的需要，已决定由重庆、成都、昆明、贵阳等地的人民出版社负责印制宪法草案的单行本，由各地新华书店发行。西南行政委员会新闻出版局为此并召集所辖印刷、出版、发行等单位开会研究，督促各方面作好这一工作。
    新华书店西南总分店和四川、贵州两省人民政府新闻出版处都已分别召开了会议，对发行方法作了研究和布置。新华书店西南总分店还编印了讨论宪法草案有关的参考书目录，以供读者在选购与讨论时的参考。另外制有发行宪法草案的幻灯片一种，分发到各地放映。
    西南邮电管理局为了加强邮寄工作，决定将寄发宪法草案的邮包，作为快邮寄发，以缩短发行时间。四川省人民政府新闻出版处和新华书店四川分店决定组织检查组，在宪法草案发行期间进行重点检查和协助县支店作好发行工作。
