    Beijing Municipal Constitution Draft Discussion Committee
    Passes Plan for Propaganda and Discussion of the Draft Constitution
   [From Our Newspaper] The Beijing Municipal Constitution Draft Discussion Committee held a plenary session of all committee members on the 15th. The meeting studied the work of training reporters over the past half-month and discussed and approved Beijing's plan for propaganda and discussion of the Draft Constitution.
    The meeting requested that the propaganda and discussion of the Draft Constitution among the people should be as extensive and in-depth as possible, so that everyone knows about it. The purpose of the propaganda and discussion is mainly to enable the people to initially understand the main content and basic spirit of the Draft Constitution and its close relationship with the people of all strata, so that everyone can recognize the great political significance of the state's enactment of the Constitution, thereby enhancing their political enthusiasm. At the same time, in the discussion, it is necessary to promote democracy and listen to the opinions of the people on the Draft Constitution.
    In order to carry out constitutional propaganda in a more planned way and to truly achieve extensive and in-depth coverage known to every household, the meeting decided that the city's propaganda activities will begin in batches, first among cadres and workers, and then extend to farmers and ordinary citizens in urban suburbs. The propaganda method is that the负责人 (person in charge) of each unit or trained reporters will make reports to the masses based on the report outline, and then, with the assistance of propagandists and theoretical study instructors, small meetings will be organized for discussion.
    The meeting requested that this propaganda should be carried out with emphasis, targeting the different characteristics and different ideological situations of the people of all strata. Each district should first pay attention to training the propaganda team to ensure the quality of the propaganda. Before the general start of propaganda and discussion, more experienced reporters should conduct trial lectures to gain experience. In the propaganda, it is necessary to implement the policy of mobilizing both men and women. Each district and unit should use the family committees of grassroots trade unions and other organizations to carry out propaganda to housewives. The streets can promote the participation of women in the discussion of the Draft Constitution through meetings of women representatives of street residents.
    In order to prevent this propaganda activity from affecting production and study, the meeting emphasized that the propaganda and discussion in factories and rural areas should be carried out during non-production hours and should not hinder production. In schools, propaganda and discussion should generally be carried out during spare time and should not hinder teaching. The meeting also stipulated that cadres of government agencies and enterprises should use their original theoretical study and current affairs study time to conduct propaganda and discussion. Cadres who study culture in various government agencies and units can have reporters give them popular explanations, and cultural studies will continue as usual. Propaganda and discussion among workers will generally use the time originally spent on political lessons. Propaganda activities in rural areas should be arranged according to agricultural production conditions. The propaganda of various universities can be carried out at an appropriate time at their discretion due to semester examinations and the participation of some students in production internships. Teachers and staff of middle and primary schools will organize reports and discussions after the examinations are completed.
    In order to widely solicit the opinions of the people on the Draft Constitution, in addition to paying attention to collecting them during organized discussions, the Beijing Municipal Constitution Draft Discussion Committee also instructed its branches to set up opinion boxes in larger streets and hutongs throughout the city in order to widely collect the opinions of the people on the Draft Constitution.
    Now the work of training reporters in Beijing is coming to an end, and a large number of reporters will be assigned to cadres and workers to launch propaganda first.

    北京市宪法草案讨论委员会
    通过宣传和讨论宪法草案的计划
   【本报讯】北京市宪法草案讨论委员会十五日举行了全体委员会议，研究了半月来训练报告员的工作，并讨论和通过了北京市关于宪法草案的宣传和讨论的计划。
    会议要求在人民群众中进行宪法草案的宣传和讨论，应尽力作到广泛深入，家喻户晓。宣传讨论的目的主要是使人民群众初步明了宪法草案的主要内容、基本精神及其与各阶层人民自己的切身关系，使大家认识到国家制定宪法这一事件的巨大政治意义，从而提高政治积极性。同时，在讨论时要发扬民主，听取人民群众对宪法草案提出的意见。
    为了使宪法宣传更有计划地进行，并能真正做到广泛深入、家喻户晓，会议确定全市的宣传活动将分批开始，先在干部、工人群众中进行，再扩展到城市郊区的农民及一般市民。宣传方式是由各单位的负责人或经过训练的报告员根据报告大纲，向群众作报告，然后在宣传员、理论学习辅导员等的协助下，组织小型会议进行讨论。
    会议要求这次宣传针对各阶层人民不同的特点与不同的思想情况有重点地进行。各区应首先注意训练宣传队伍，以保证宣传质量。在宣传和讨论普遍开始前，应该由较有经验的报告员进行试讲，以取得经验。在宣传中要贯彻男女一齐发动的方针。各区、各单位应该运用基层工会的家属委员会等组织进行对家庭妇女的宣传。街道可通过街道居民妇女代表会议推动妇女群众参加宪法草案的讨论。
    为了使这次宣传活动不致影响生产和学习，会议强调指出：在工厂和农村中的宣传和讨论，应在非生产时间进行，不得妨碍生产。在学校中，一般应在课余时间进行宣传和讨论，不得妨碍教学。会议并规定：机关企业的干部一律用原来理论学习、时事学习的时间来进行宣传和讨论。各机关单位学文化的干部，可由报告员给他们作通俗讲解，文化学习照常进行。工人中的宣传和讨论一般利用原来上政治课的时间进行。农村中的宣传活动应根据农业生产情况进行安排。各高等学校的宣传因学期考试及部分学生参加生产实习，可酌情在适当的时间内进行。中、小学校教职员在考试完毕后组织报告和讨论。
    为了广泛征求人民群众对于宪法草案的意见，除了在组织讨论时注意搜集以外，北京市宪法草案讨论委员会还指示各分会在全市较大的街道、胡同设立意见箱，以便广泛征集人民群众对宪法草案的意见。
    现在北京市训练报告员的工作即将结束，大批的报告员将分配到干部和工人中首先展开宣传。
