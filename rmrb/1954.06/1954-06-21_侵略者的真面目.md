The Relationship between the United States, France, and Bảo Đại

Recently, American news agencies have been constantly expressing dissatisfaction with the Vietnamese puppet Bảo Đại in France. A United Press International dispatch from Geneva on May 29th stated that if Bảo Đại's actions are not commensurate with his title of "Head of State," he might be disqualified as a Vietnamese puppet. Why is the United States "dissatisfied" with this puppet? The French weekly "National Forum" stated that the U.S. government has taken a fancy to Nguyễn Hữu Trí, the so-called "Chairman" of North Vietnam, believing that replacing Bảo Đại with him could form a government that dares to sever the last ties with the French Federation, thereby achieving Wall Street's goal of completely excluding France from Indochina.

When the United States strongly criticized Bảo Đại for "not returning to his homeland," it originally hoped France would chime in. However, according to "New York Herald Tribune" reporter Hitchins, France did not do so because French officials believed that Bảo Đại was already "completely independent," and France was unwilling to be accused of interfering in Bảo Đại's internal affairs. The implication is very clear: let no one make accusations, otherwise, things will not look good for anyone!

The "Worries" of the U.S. Authorities

According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on June 8th, U.S. authorities admitted that news from official Indochina sources about the low morale of the Vietnamese puppet army was "worrying." These reports indicated that "the number of Vietnamese soldiers defecting to the Viet Minh army has increased," and "the morale of Vietnamese troops attacked by the Viet Minh army is increasingly flagging." Therefore, U.S. authorities believe that if the United States could replace France in training the Bảo Đại puppet army, their morale would "improve." In fact, no one believes this boasting, because the low morale of the Vietnamese puppet army is fundamentally due to the unpopularity of this dirty war, not the effectiveness of their training. Take Korea as an example. The Syngman Rhee puppet army there was equipped and trained by the United States, right? But how did they perform in the Korean War? In mid-July last year, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers launched a counterattack on the Kimhwa front, routing four so-called elite divisions of the Rhee puppet army, inflicting heavy losses. Even the American United Press International had to report in frustration: "So many were annihilated, and they retreated so far." This is a portrayal of the so-called "morale" under direct U.S. training. Therefore, all the clamoring by the U.S. authorities only further exposes their consistent conspiracy: to seize the Bảo Đại puppet army from France and expand the Indochina war.

The Cold Reception at the Reporter "Briefing"

The "New York Times" stated in its Geneva dispatch on May 25th that the American delegation's morning reporter "briefing," specifically set up to cover the Geneva Conference, has automatically stopped holding sessions due to a lack of attendees. It is said that some American reporters are full of complaints about this so-called "briefing," believing that the "reports" provided by the American delegation are inaccurate, difficult to justify, and that this so-called "briefing" has a restriction, which is that all "news" obtained here cannot specify that it comes from the American delegation. No wonder American reporters complain that the American delegation has not "helped" them. In fact, it would be wrong to say that the American delegation is not "helping" their reporters. The purpose of setting up a "briefing" and providing materials is to help their own reporters. But regrettably, the materials are all inaccurate, and their source is not allowed to be pointed out, which makes it impossible for American reporters to justify themselves and avoid the responsibility of spreading rumors.

Wonderful Logic

Since the beginning of this year, American spies disguised as "explorers," "photographers," "missionaries," and various "experts" have been constantly visiting the small mountain kingdom of Nepal. Many of their conspiracies have been exposed by the people and public opinion in Nepal. In early June, Nepalese customs discovered a package containing four American military radio transceivers in the mail. According to the "Hindustan Standard," this package was sent from the United States to Shyam Shumsher, the leader of the reactionary Gurkha party in Nepal. The matter is so obvious, and the evidence is so solid. However, according to Associated Press reporter Milks, the U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal, Allen, is still quibbling. Allen said that he can be sure that the United States has not participated in political activities or engaged in other inappropriate behavior in Nepal. He also said that the United States has no interests in Nepal other than agreeing to requests for technical assistance.

Sending four military radio transceivers to the leader of a reactionary party in a country is not "political activity," not "inappropriate behavior," and not having any "interests." It's as if it's merely "technical assistance." This is truly a wonderful logic.

    侵略者的真面目
    美国法国和保大的关系
    近来，美国通讯社不断发出对在法国的越南傀儡保大不满的声音。合众社日内瓦五月二十九日的电讯说：如果保大的行动和他的“元首”称号不相称的话，就可能取消他当越南傀儡的资格。为什么美国对这个傀儡“感到不满”呢？法国“民族论坛”周刊说，美国政府已看中了所谓北越的“主席”阮友智，认为用他来代替保大的话，就可以组成一个敢于和法兰西联邦断绝最后联系的政府，也就可以达到华尔街在印度支那完全排除法国的目的了。
    当美国对保大“不回到他的祖国”大加指责时，本来希望法国帮帮腔，但是据美国“纽约先驱论坛报”的记者希琴斯说，法国并没有这样做，因为法国官员们认为，保大已经“完全独立”了，法国不愿再被人指责为干涉保大的内政。言外之意十分明显：谁也不要指责了，要不然，大家都不好看！
    美国当局的“忧虑”
    据六月八日从华盛顿发出的路透社电讯：美国当局承认，从印度支那官方传来的关于越南傀儡军士气低落的消息，是“令人忧虑”的。这些消息说明：“投到越盟军去的越南士兵人数增加了”，“遭到越盟军攻击的越南部队的斗志日益不振。”因此，美国当局认为，要是美国能够代替法国训练保大傀儡军，那么他们的士气就会“有所提高”。事实上，美国这种吹牛，当然没人相信，因为越南傀儡军的士气所以不振，根本上是因为这个肮脏的战争不得人心，并不是对他们的训练是否得法。就拿朝鲜为例，那里的李承晚傀儡军，该是美国一手装备训练起来的吧！但在朝鲜战争中如何？去年七月中旬，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在金城前线发起反击，把据守在那里号称精锐的李伪军四个师打得丢盔弃甲，损兵折将，连美国合众社都不得不懊丧地报道：“被消灭的那么多，并且败退了那么远。”这就是美国直接训练下的所谓“士气”的写照。所以，美国当局的一切叫嚣，只是更加暴露了他的一贯阴谋：从法国手中夺取保大傀儡军，扩大印度支那战争。
    冷场的记者“报道会”
    美国“纽约时报”在它五月二十五日的日内瓦专讯里说，美国代表团专门为采访日内瓦会议而设的记者早晨“报道会”，因为无人上门，已经自动停止举行了。据说有些美国记者对这个所谓“报道会”满腹牢骚，他们认为美国代表团供给他们的
  “报道”材料都不确实，很难自圆其说，而且这个所谓“报道会”还有一种限制，就是所有从这里得到的“新闻”材料，都不能指明是来自美国代表团的。难怪美国记者抱怨美国代表团对他们没有“帮助”。其实，要说美国代表团不去“帮助”他们的记者，那倒是一件冤枉事。专设“报道会”和供给材料的目的，就是要帮助自己的记者的。但遗憾的是材料都不确实，又不准指出它的来源，这就使美国记者也不能自圆其说和无法推卸造谣的责任了。
    奇妙的逻辑
    今年以来，披着“探险家”、“摄影师”、“传教士”以及各种各样“专家”外衣的美国间谍分子，不断访问小小的山国尼泊尔。其中不少阴谋活动已被尼泊尔的人民和舆论揭穿了。六月初，尼泊尔的海关又从邮件中发现了一个装着四架美国军用无线电收发报机的邮包。据“印度斯坦旗报”证实：这个邮包是从美国寄给尼泊尔反动的廓尔喀党的领袖沙姆舍尔的。事情是如此明显，证据是如此确凿，但据美联社记者米尔克斯报道：美国驻印度兼尼泊尔大使艾伦还在诡辩，艾伦说：他可以肯定，美国没有在尼泊尔参加政治活动或进行其他不适当的行为。又说美国在尼泊尔除了答应技术援助的要求外，没有其他的利害关系。
    把四架军用无线电收发报机送给一个国家的反动派领袖，这还不是“政治活动”，不是“不适当的行为”，也不是有什么“利害关系”，仿佛只是“技术援助”，这真是一种奇妙的逻辑。
