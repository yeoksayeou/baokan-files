Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 22nd: The restricted meeting of the nine-nation delegation discussing the issue of restoring peace in Indochina issued the following communique on the 22nd:
"The nine-nation delegation continued to discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina at the restricted meeting on June 22nd. The next restricted meeting will be held on June 24th."

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 22nd: Special correspondent of this agency reports: According to the agreement of the restricted meeting on June 19th, the meeting will continue to be held during the period when the heads of the delegations of various countries leave Geneva, so the nine-nation delegation continued to hold a restricted meeting on the Indochina issue on the 22nd. It is reported that the meeting on the 22nd discussed the issue of Indochina armistice supervision. Li Kenong, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, attended the meeting on the 22nd.

The Soviet delegation had put forward twelve suggestions on the issues of the Joint Committee, Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and international guarantees on June 14th. Since the meeting turned to the discussion of the issues of Laos and Cambodia after June 16th, the meeting has not yet started discussion on the twelve suggestions of the Soviet delegation. It is reported that the Chinese delegation pointed out at the meeting on the 22nd that since the meeting has reached a preliminary agreement on the issues of Laos and Cambodia, negotiations on the issue of supervision should be based on the twelve suggestions of the Soviet delegation.

The Chinese delegation expressed its support at the meeting for the new suggestion of the Soviet delegation on June 16th regarding the composition of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. This suggestion advocates that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be composed of five countries: India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Pakistan, and Indonesia, with India as the chairman, or that the members of the commission should be reduced to three countries, namely India, Poland, and Indonesia, with India still as the chairman.

The Chinese delegation and the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also pointed out at the meeting on the 22nd that since the armistice is to be realized by the belligerent parties, the Joint Committee should bear the primary responsibility for supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement clauses. The Chinese delegation also expressed the hope that the meeting would determine the relationship and scope of powers of the Joint Committee composed of representatives of the headquarters of the belligerent parties and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission as soon as possible.

It is reported that the US delegation raised the issue of the United Nations supervising the armistice at the meeting on the 22nd. The Soviet delegation immediately pointed out that the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union had repeatedly refuted the so-called United Nations supervision issue in past meetings, so this issue is not worth discussing at this meeting.

    九国代表团限制性会议讨论印度支那停战监察问题
    中越两国支持苏联提出的十二点新建议
    苏联代表团再次驳斥美国提出由联合国监察停战的主张
    【新华社日内瓦二十二日电】日内瓦会议讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的限制性会议二十二日发表公报如下：
      “九国代表团在六月二十二日的限制性会议中继续讨论恢复印度支那和平问题。下次限制性会议将在六月二十四日举行。”
    【新华社日内瓦二十二日电】本社特派记者报道：按照六月十九日限制性会议的协议，在各国代表团团长离开日内瓦的期间，会议将继续举行，因而九国代表团于二十二日继续举行讨论印度支那问题的限制性会议。据悉，二十二日的会议讨论了印度支那停战监察问题。中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部副部长李克农出席了二十二日的会议。
    苏联代表团在六月十四日曾就联合委员会、中立国监察委员会和国际保证问题提出了十二点建议。由于六月十六日以后会议转入关于老挝和柬埔寨问题的讨论，会议对于苏联代表团的十二点建议至今尚未开始讨论。据悉，中国代表团在二十二日的会议上指出，现在会议既已就老挝和柬埔寨问题达成了初步协议，应即以苏联代表团的十二点建议为基础来进行关于监察问题的商谈。
    中国代表团在会议上对苏联代表团在六月十六日关于中立国监察委员会的成员问题的新建议表示赞成。这个建议主张由印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚五国组成中立国监察委员会，而以印度为主席，或者是把委员会成员缩小为三个国家，即印度、波兰和印度尼西亚，仍以印度为主席。
    中国代表团和越南民主共和国代表团还在二十二日会议上指出，由于停战是要靠交战双方来实现的，联合委员会应当负有监督履行停战协定条款的主要责任。中国代表团并表示，希望会议早日确定由交战双方司令部代表组成的联合委员会与中立国监察委员会的关系和职权范围。
    据悉，美国代表团在二十二日会议上又提出了由联合国来监察停战的问题。苏联代表团当即指出：越南民主共和国、中国和苏联代表团在过去的会议上，对所谓联合国监察问题已一再加以驳斥，因而这个问题是不值得在本会议上讨论的。
