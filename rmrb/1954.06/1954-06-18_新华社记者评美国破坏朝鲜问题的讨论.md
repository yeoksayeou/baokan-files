Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 16th -- Xinhua News Agency special correspondent Shen Jiantu reports: Western newspapers on the 16th deliberately downplayed the new proposals put forth at the final session of the Geneva Conference on the Korean question on the 15th that could have allowed the conference to reach a solution. They remained silent on the fact that the interruption of negotiations was carried out according to a pre-determined plan drafted by the meeting of sixteen nations convened by the United States. Disregarding the new proposals made at the meeting by Foreign Minister Nam Il, Foreign Minister Molotov, and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai to seek an agreement, the pre-prepared declaration of the sixteen nations closed the door to continued negotiations in Geneva.

The nearly six-hour meeting held on the 15th clearly demonstrated to the world which delegation made the greatest efforts to seek an agreement in Geneva and which delegation rejected every effort. Observers here unanimously believe that the US delegation, along with other delegations, did not even pretend to study others' suggestions, but rejected them all rudely, making it impossible for them to evade the responsibility for sabotaging the negotiations in front of the whole world. Since the US delegation was unwilling to reach any solution on the Korean issue, it was no secret here that no matter what proposals others made, it would have other delegations read out the declaration ending the negotiations.

When Foreign Minister Nam Il's six-point proposal was distributed at "Press House," observers pointed out that this proposal eliminated the "UN-supervised elections" excuse manufactured by the United States. An agreement could have been reached on at least six other issues, including the withdrawal of foreign troops within a specified time frame in accordance with the principle of proportionality.

During the short recess, the US delegation convened another meeting of the sixteen-nation delegations to have them read out the declaration of breaking off negotiations as planned. Without even giving the delegations the opportunity to study and consider the six-point proposal, it was rejected. As soon as the Soviet Union proposed that the countries participating in the Geneva Conference issue a joint declaration "not to take any actions that might threaten the maintenance of peace in Korea," it was immediately rejected by the US delegation.

Smith hurriedly spoke to reject another proposal put forward by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, which advocated that the countries participating in the Geneva Conference continue their efforts to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean question. Smith's agitation and confusion became even more evident at the meeting when the Belgian delegation expressed its willingness to accept the Chinese proposal, especially when Eden said that if no one objected, he would suggest that the statement be considered generally accepted by the meeting. When no delegation objected, Smith excitedly stood up and rejected the proposal. At the same time, after hearing the Chinese proposal, Syngman Rhee's Foreign Minister slipped away from the meeting.

At the press conference held by the US delegation, the US spokesperson attempted to prevent reporters from knowing the fact that the Belgian delegation agreed with the Chinese proposal. The US spokesperson finally said, "The explanation is confusing," in order to evade the many questions raised by the reporters. At the press conference, the US spokesperson did not mention Smith's rejection of the Chinese proposal.

Off the record, American journalists, who have always promoted the US delegation's approach, remained silent about the US's repeated rejection of other people's suggestions at the meeting. When it was pointed out that the world saw the US policy as responsible because the US refused to reach any kind of agreement on the Korean question—whether temporary or permanent—they said nothing.

The record of the fifty-one days of meetings discussing the Korean question shows that the US delegation did not put forward a single proposal seeking a solution. On the contrary, it rejected all seven constructive proposals made by the delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union to reach an agreement. The US delegation did not abandon at all the stubborn position taken by Dulles since the beginning of the negotiations, which was the position that the armies of sixteen countries had not been able to achieve on the battlefield: to force the Korean people to obey the illegal UN resolution of October 1950.

The unilateral declaration of the sixteen nations, led by the United States, has closed the door to further discussions on the Korean question in Geneva, and the US delegation has closed the door to future efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean question. The United States, which signed the Korean Armistice Agreement, has violated the armistice agreement in Geneva on two points: refusing to withdraw foreign troops from Korea and closing the door to a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. This is clearly part of a US policy of continuing the Cold War and keeping Korea divided and unstable, so that when the Pentagon's war planners give the signal, they can use the American bayonet to support the dictatorial Syngman Rhee regime's northward advance. By obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean question, Washington can continue to tie its "allies" to Syngman Rhee's war chariot. The US refusal to declare that it will not take any actions that could threaten the maintenance of peace in Korea proves that Washington wants to carry out aggression in Korea as it pleases.

South Korean Foreign Minister Pyun Yung-tai said at a press conference on the afternoon of the 16th: "The world is tired of negotiations." He told reporters that the world would rather have war than negotiations, and he said:
  "You can call me a warmonger if you like."

The delegations of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have repeatedly stated their willingness to continue their efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. This heinous conspiracy by the United States and the Syngman Rhee delegation to undermine peace cannot escape the judgment of the increasingly loud world opinion that advocates easing tensions and building peace.

    新华社记者评美国破坏朝鲜问题的讨论
    【新华社日内瓦十六日电】本社特派记者沈建图报道：西方报纸十六日故意贬低在十五日的日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的最后一次会议上能够使会议得出解决办法的新建议。它们缄口不提谈判的中断是按照美国召集的十六国会议所拟订的预定计划而进行的这一事实。不顾南日外务相、莫洛托夫外交部长与周恩来外交部长在会议上提出的谋求达成协议的新建议，十六国预先拟就的宣言关闭了在日内瓦继续谈判的大门。
    十五日举行的将近六小时的会议向全世界清楚地表明了：哪个代表团尽了最大努力来谋求在日内瓦达成协议，哪个代表团拒绝了每一项努力。此间观察家一致认为，美国代表团与其他代表团对于别人的建议，甚至没有装出研究一下的样子，就一概粗暴地加以拒绝，这使得他们无法逃避在全世界面前承担破坏谈判的责任。由于美国代表团不愿意在朝鲜问题上得到任何解决，因此，无论别人提出了什么建议，它都会使其他代表团来宣读结束谈判的宣言的，这一点在这里已经不是什么秘密了。
    当南日外务相的六点建议在“新闻大厦”散发的时候，观察家指出，这个建议消除了美国制造出来的“联合国监督选举”的借口。至少在六个其他的问题上是能够达成协议的，其中包括遵照按比例的原则，在规定时限内撤退外国军队。
    在短短的休会时间中，美国代表团召集了另一次十六国代表团会议，使它们按计划宣读破裂谈判的宣言。甚至并没有给予各代表团以研究并考虑六点建议的机会，这个建议就被拒绝了。苏联刚一提出主张参加日内瓦会议各国发表一项“不得采取任何可能足以对维持朝鲜和平构成威胁的行动”的共同宣言的建议，就立刻遭到了美国代表团的拒绝。
    史密斯急忙发言拒绝周恩来外交部长提出的另一个建议，这个建议主张参加日内瓦会议各国继续努力来谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决。在比利时代表团表示愿意接受中国的建议，尤其是在艾登说假如没有人反对，他建议就认为这个声明已为会议所普遍接受的时候，史密斯的激动与忙乱在会议上更加明显了。当时没有代表团表示反对，史密斯便激动地站起来拒绝了这个建议。同时，李承晚的外务部长官在听见了中国的建议以后，就从会上溜跑了。
    在美国代表团举行的记者招待会上，美国发言人企图不让记者们知道比利时代表同意中国建议的事实。美国发言人最后说：“解释很混乱”，这样来逃避记者们提出的许多问题。在记者招待会上，美国发言人没有提到史密斯拒绝中国的建议。
    在会外，一贯鼓吹美国代表团方针的美国记者对于美国在会议上接二连三地拒绝别人的建议保持沉默。当有人指出，由于美国拒绝在朝鲜问题上达成任何种类的协议——不论是临时性的，还是永久性的——因此全世界都看到美国政策要负其咎的时候，他们什么话也不说。
    讨论朝鲜问题的五十一天的会议的记录表明：美国代表团连一个寻求解决方案的建议也没有提出。相反地，它还拒绝了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中国与苏联代表团为了达成协议而提出的所有七个建设性的建议。美国代表团丝毫没有放弃杜勒斯从谈判开始以来所采取的顽固的立场，这就是十六个国家的军队在战场上都没有能够实现的要朝鲜人民服从一九五○年十月联合国非法决议的立场。
    以美国为首的十六国的片面宣言，已经关闭了在日内瓦就朝鲜问题作进一步商谈的大门，而且，美国代表团已经关闭了将来就和平解决朝鲜问题从事努力的大门。在朝鲜停战协定上签了字的美国，已经在两点上在日内瓦破坏了停战协定：拒绝从朝鲜撤退外国军队以及关上了和平解决朝鲜问题的大门。这显然是美国政策的一部分，这种政策是继续进行冷战，以及使得朝鲜继续保持分裂的、不稳定的状态，以便等到五角大楼的战争策划者们发出信号的时候，就可以用美国的刺刀来支持独裁的李承晚政权北进。阻挠了朝鲜问题的和平解决，华盛顿也就可以把它的“盟国”继续绑在李承晚的战车上。美国拒绝宣布不得采取任何足以对维持朝鲜和平构成威胁的行动，证明华盛顿想在朝鲜为所欲为地进行侵略。
    南朝鲜外务部长官卞荣泰十六日下午在记者招待会上说：“世界对于谈判已经感到厌倦。”他告诉记者们说，全世界宁愿战争，也不愿谈判，他说：
  “你们叫我战争贩子也可以。”
    苏联、中华人民共和国与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表团已经屡次表明愿意继续努力以实现和平解决朝鲜问题的立场。美国和李承晚代表团这种罪大恶极的破坏和平的阴谋，逃不过主张缓和紧张局势与建立和平的日益宏亮的世界舆论的裁判。
