Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 11th: More than two hundred basic construction units in Hunan Province have successively started work. The next four months are the season with the least rainfall and most suitable for construction in Hunan. All units are striving to complete 80% of the annual construction plan by the end of the third quarter. Currently, tens of thousands of workers are working intensely on these construction sites.

Hunan Province has a large basic construction task this year, with a 44.75% increase in workload compared to last year, and a construction area of 950,000 square meters, of which industry accounts for 68%. The completion of these projects will greatly enhance Hunan Province's industrial production capacity. For example, after all three generators of the Xiangzhong Electric Power Bureau are installed, the installed capacity of power generation equipment in the Xiangzhong area next year will increase by 40% compared to the present. After the expansion projects of the seven state-owned and local state-owned machinery factories, which are adjusting equipment and rebuilding factory buildings, are completed, they will produce more motors, machine tools, auto parts, and diesel engines and water pumps for farmland water conservancy. In conjunction with these industrial constructions, a large number of workers' dormitories, school classrooms, hospitals, and water plants are also being built in Xiangtan, Hengyang, Changsha, and other cities.

In order to ensure that these projects can be completed according to plan, the construction units concerned have carried out the construction preparation work earlier this year. The Finance and Economics Committees of the People's Governments of Hunan Province have successively held project scheduling meetings and timely allocated the equipment, materials, and construction forces needed by various construction units. From January to April, the Hunan Building Materials Manufacturing Company supplied the construction units with red bricks and lime, which increased by one to four times compared with the same period last year. Ships and trucks on various transportation lines transported a large number of building materials to the construction sites every day, and machines ordered from Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang and other places also arrived one after another. The commencement dates of various construction units were generally earlier than last year.

While carrying out construction preparations, the six engineering companies under the Hunan Provincial Construction Engineering Administration Bureau have all examined and criticized capitalist ideas in management and actively adopted various measures to reduce construction costs. At present, the Design Office of the Construction Engineering Bureau has put forward ninety-one specific measures to reduce costs; in terms of construction, it has also formulated a plan to reduce the construction loss rate of eleven major materials and the base price and freight of eight materials. The Finance and Economics Committee of the People's Government of Hunan Province also held a basic construction conference, focusing on the issue of reducing the design budget quota for construction projects. The Hunan Provincial Construction Trade Union also held a provincial advanced producer conference in late March to summarize the more than one hundred advanced tools and more than a dozen advanced operating methods created by workers on various construction sites last year. After the meeting, many construction sites have established research groups to promote advanced experience, and are actively preparing to carry out labor competitions with technological innovation as the main content.

    湖南省二百多个基本建设单位先后开工
    工程公司批判资本主义经营思想降低建筑成本
    【新华社长沙十一日电】湖南省已有二百多个基本建设单位先后开工。今后四个月是湖南雨天最少、最适宜于施工的季节，各单位正争取到第三季度末完成全年施工计划百分之八十。现在，这些工地上已有几万工人紧张地在进行施工。
    湖南省今年的基本建设任务很大，工作量比去年增加百分之四十四点七五，建筑面积有九十五万平方公尺，其中工业方面占百分之六十八。这些工程完成以后，对提高湖南省工业生产能力有很大作用。例如湘中电业局三部发电机全部安装完毕后，明年湘中地区的发电设备容量将比目前增加百分之四十。正在调整设备，改建厂房的七个国营和地方国营机械厂的扩建工程完成后，将生产更多的电动机、工作母机、汽车零件和供给农田水利用的柴油机和水泵等。配合这些工业建设，湘潭、衡阳、长沙等城市还在新建大批工人宿舍、学校教室、医院、自来水厂等。
    为了保证这些工程能按计划完成，今年有关建设单位的施工准备工作都进行得较早。湖南省各地人民政府财政经济委员会都先后召开了工程排队会议，及时调配了各建设单位需要的设备、材料、施工力量等。湖南建筑器材制造公司自一月到四月供给各建设单位的红砖和石灰，比去年同期增加了一倍到四倍。各交通线上的轮船、汽车每天装运着大批建筑器材运往工地，从上海、天津、沈阳等地订购的机器也都陆续运到。各建设单位开工日期一般都比去年提早了。
    在进行施工准备的同时，湖南省人民政府建筑工程管理局所属六个工程公司，都检查和批判了经营方面的资本主义思想，并积极采取各种措施降低建筑成本。目前，建筑工程局设计室已提出了九十一条降低成本的具体措施；在施工方面也已订出了降低十一种主要材料施工损耗率和八种材料基价和运费的计划。湖南省人民政府财政经济委员会还召开了基本建设会议，着重讨论了降低建筑工程设计预算定额问题。湖南省建筑工会也在三月下旬举行全省先进生产者会议，总结去年各工地工人创造的一百多件先进工具和十几种先进操作法。会后，许多工地都已成立了推广先进经验研究小组，并正在积极准备开展以技术革新为内容的劳动竞赛。
