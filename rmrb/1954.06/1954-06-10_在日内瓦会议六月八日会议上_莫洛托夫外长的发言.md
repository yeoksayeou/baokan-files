Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates!

Restoring peace in Indochina is an important task of the Geneva Conference. The people of Indochina place their hopes on the Geneva Conference, expecting it to contribute to the cause of peace, independence, freedom, and unification for the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The people of the world sympathize with the national liberation movements of the Indochinese countries. Their struggle for national independence and freedom should be recognized by this conference. The participants of the Geneva Conference bear a significant responsibility to facilitate a swift cessation of hostilities and the establishment of a lasting and consolidated peace in Indochina.

However, it must be noted that it is clear that not all conference participants have understood their responsibilities in the same way. This is evident in everything that happens inside and outside the Geneva Conference, and everything that coincides with this conference. One gets the impression that not all participants are concerned with quickly restoring peace in Indochina. Indeed, some may attend the Geneva Conference, but their task is not to restore peace in Indochina, but to prove that it is impossible to reach an agreement on a ceasefire in Indochina. And those who are eager to prove that an agreement is impossible are not simply prolonging the Indochina war, but are in fact planning to further expand the war, despite its dangerous consequences.

Facts prove that the governments of some countries not only do not want to restore peace in Indochina, but are trying to plan a further expansion of the Indochina war, and are gathering more people to participate in this war. We cannot ignore this plan, which is closely related to the U.S. State Department.

This can be proved by the following facts: Some people are constantly working to establish a so-called "Southeast Asia" military group led by the United States. Some colonial countries and their most loyal vassals will participate in this group. The military conference held in Washington by the United States, Britain, France, Australia, and New Zealand illustrates this point. The actions of the Thai government also belong to this category of facts. It is obviously directed by foreign aggression groups to try to hinder the settlement of the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference. Thailand's proposal to establish a committee under the United Nations Security Council to monitor the situation on the Indochina border is an attempt to preemptively find some excuses for the United Nations in name, but actually for the United States, to interfere in the internal affairs of Indochina. This proposal aims to undermine confidence in the Geneva Conference, which is studying specific issues for restoring peace in Indochina.

We also cannot ignore that the aggressive groups of some countries are afraid that the Geneva Conference will achieve some positive results in the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue. In this situation, the Soviet delegation believes that it must emphasize the responsibility of this conference for stopping hostilities in Indochina and restoring peace in Indochina.

As for the Soviet Union, it does not regard the issue of stopping hostilities in Indochina as a short-term respite for continuing or even expanding the war in the future, but as the establishment of a consolidated peace. Precisely for this reason, we believe that both military and political issues must be discussed at the Geneva Conference.

I. On the Issue of Stopping Hostilities

When discussing the Indochina issue, an agreement was reached to start with military issues and then discuss political issues in resolving the Indochina issue. Now is the time to summarize the results of the discussions on military issues in the past four weeks, and no longer delay the discussion of the political issues of Indochina, because it has been proven in the discussion that these two types of issues are closely related.

The delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and France have both put forward proposals on stopping hostilities in Indochina. During the discussion, the delegation of the People's Republic of China put forward proposals on the basic principles of the agreement on stopping hostilities. During the discussion of these proposals, it was proven that there were signs of some coordination of views among the participants on several issues.

These issues primarily include the following: All armed forces of the warring parties must simultaneously cease hostilities throughout Indochina. Although some reservations were made in this regard at the conference, everyone knows that we have reached an agreement on this issue.

Given the complex military situation in Indochina, stopping hostilities requires first resolving the issue of the areas of concentration of the forces of both sides. There is no other way to solve this problem other than through direct negotiations between the two sides. According to the agreement reached at the May 29th meeting, military representatives of both sides established contact. Military representatives of both sides are now in contact in Geneva. At the same time, it is also believed that this contact must be established locally in Indochina. The discussion on adjusting areas and the corresponding regrouping of troops on both sides has begun, which is an important step in resolving the Indochina issue.

It has also been affirmed in the discussion that all participants of the Geneva Conference agree in principle with the proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam that after the cessation of hostilities in Indochina, no new troops and various military personnel, as well as various types of weapons and ammunition, should be transported into Indochina from the outside. This is understandable, because if no measures are taken to prevent the transport of troops, weapons, and ammunition into Indochina from the outside, any agreement on the cessation of hostilities may become a scrap of paper. Otherwise, the cessation of hostilities may be used as a short respite to accumulate strength and re-ignite the war, perhaps on a larger scale.

The participants also have little doubt about the establishment of a mixed committee composed of representatives of both sides to supervise the implementation of the terms of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities. The significant role of this committee is even more obvious from the fact that the directly relevant parties bear the primary responsibility for the implementation of the above-mentioned agreement. If the directly relevant parties are unwilling to implement the agreement that has been reached, then no one else can guarantee that the agreement signed will have the desired effect.

The issue of establishing international supervision to monitor the implementation of the terms of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina has been discussed in particularly great detail. All delegations agree that in order to establish this international supervision, appropriate and authoritative international institutions must be established. I must say a few more words on this issue, because there are still large differences in the positions of the delegations in this regard.

As everyone knows, the Soviet delegation took a positive attitude towards the French proposal, that the participants of the Geneva Conference should assume the responsibility for guaranteeing the implementation of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina. Other delegations have also expressed the need for guarantees, although not all aspects of this issue have been fully considered.

However, there are disagreements between the delegations on some issues.

What are these issues?

First of all, we must talk about the issue of international supervision of the implementation of the agreement.

As everyone knows, the Soviet Union proposed that the neutral nations monitoring committee should be composed of four countries: India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Pakistan. Two of the four countries—India and Pakistan—have diplomatic relations with one party, and the other two countries—Poland and Czechoslovakia—have diplomatic relations with the other party, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Soviet delegation believes that an international committee composed of the above-mentioned members will have the necessary authority and can guarantee that there will be no partiality or bias towards one party in the work of this international institution. It is groundless to oppose the participation of countries such as Poland and Czechoslovakia in this committee, arguing that they cannot stand in a neutral position here due to ideological reasons. To a large extent, such objections can be raised against capitalist countries. Here, they obviously forget that the above-mentioned conclusion is a harmful conclusion and does not need to be publicized anymore. Nor can it be forgotten that, according to the Korean armistice agreement, a neutral nations committee with representatives from Poland and Czechoslovakia was also established. At present, attempts to slander the Korean neutral nations committee are obviously groundless and can only be regarded as attempts to obstruct the reaching of an agreement on this important issue. Appropriate agreements have not been reached on the tasks and powers of the international monitoring committee and the mixed committee of representatives of both sides. The relationship between these two committees should be determined according to the differences in their respective powers.

The main tasks of the neutral nations committee are:

Guarantee the cessation of the transport of new troops and various military personnel, as well as various types of weapons and ammunition, into Indochina;

Monitor the implementation of the clauses regarding the demarcation of military demarcation lines and the establishment of demilitarized zones;

Monitor the transfer of troops on both sides during area adjustments; monitor the repatriation of prisoners of war and detained civilians by both sides;

Investigate the facts of violations of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in the demilitarized zone based on the request of the mixed committee or one party, and submit recommendations to both parties on stopping the violations.

The tasks of the mixed committee are: to ensure the implementation of concrete measures on the ground for the implementation of the clauses of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities. These measures will involve the following issues:

Supervise the simultaneous ceasefire in various places;

Implement the plan for adjusting areas and regrouping troops on both sides;

Resolve other issues related to violations of the terms of the agreement through negotiations between the military representatives of both sides.

Now a question arises: What should be done if the two committees, internally or between them, fail to reach an agreement on this or that issue? In other words, to which institution should an appeal be made in the event of disagreements in the various committees? If we start from the above-mentioned proposal, that certain countries should guarantee the implementation of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina, then it is not difficult to answer this question. That is to say, the guaranteeing countries will become the organ to which appeals are made when necessary. They will have the responsibility to take appropriate measures that are agreed upon by everyone to stop situations that violate the above-mentioned agreement or stop the threat of violating this agreement.

It must be admitted that the nature and powers of the institutions that supervise the implementation of the terms of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina still need further study. But if we all agree on some starting points, then it will not be too difficult to reach an agreement on this important issue.

In the process of discussing the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, a question has arisen: Does the decision on the cessation of hostilities and the stipulation of appropriate ceasefire conditions apply to all three countries in Indochina? The participants have disagreed on this point. The starting point of the Soviet delegation is: Our task is to restore peace throughout Indochina, as stipulated in the communiqué of the Berlin Conference.

What cannot be ignored here is that the basic reasons for the events in all three countries of Indochina—Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos—are completely the same. The events in Indochina show that Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia are all engaged in national liberation struggles against foreign colonial rule. Participating in this struggle are not only these or those armed forces, but the people themselves. Only in this way can it be explained why the Indochina national liberation movement is so large and so powerful. Of course, the differences in the national liberation movements in the Indochinese countries cannot be ignored.

For example, in Vietnam, three-quarters of the country's territory is no longer under the rule of officials appointed by the Bao Dai government. Everyone knows that the northern part of Vietnam, as well as vast lands in the central and southern parts, are managed by the institutions of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. As for Laos, about half of the country is no longer under the management of the institutions of the Kingdom of Laos government. Although the area of ​​Cambodia that is not controlled by the Cambodian Kingdom authorities is smaller than in other parts of Indochina, the national liberation struggle here is also developing rapidly. It can be seen that it is incorrect to deny the existence of national liberation struggles in Laos and Cambodia and to believe that the events here are influenced by certain external factors, such as the interference of Vietnamese armed forces. The chief representative of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has convincingly refuted this claim.

The representatives of the Kingdom of Laos and the Kingdom of Cambodia present here hold a different view on this issue. However, does not the representative of the Bao Dai government here also want to deny the existence of the Vietnamese national liberation movement, although these arguments are obviously untenable? It can be said with complete justification that this kind of argument itself proves that it neither reflects the actual situation nor reflects the true relationship with the people of the country. This kind of argument is just a groundless denial of facts that everyone knows.

Some participants in the conference are trying to convince us that the task of establishing the independence of the Indochinese countries—Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia—seems to have been completely resolved, and that the national demands of these countries have been met. To this end, the representative of the Kingdom of Cambodia cited the agreements signed with France in 1949 and 1953. The representative of the Kingdom of Laos also cited the agreement signed with France in 1949 here. Finally, the representative of the Bao Dai government also cited an agreement that was recently concluded with France. However, this agreement has not yet been signed and therefore has not been made public. All these statements cannot be trusted, because they have not guaranteed the independence of the Indochinese countries in the past and do not guarantee it now. In this case, it can be understood why almost none of the Asian countries, including India, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Burma, think that these statements are of any great significance. Only this can explain why Asian countries are unwilling to establish diplomatic relations with Bao Dai Vietnam, the Kingdom of Laos, and the Kingdom of Cambodia. In addition, the remarks of famous political and social figures in France and the United States, who pay close attention to the Indochina issue, can be cited. They acknowledge that there are national liberation movements in the three countries of Indochina, and at the same time point out that France must ultimately guarantee the independence of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

The war in Indochina has been going on for eight years. The French government has made many attempts to achieve its goals by military means. But this has not achieved any results.

Since the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, France has implemented many plans to militarily defeat the Vietnamese army, strangle the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and thus restore the colonial system. This has caused many losses to the people of Indochina. At the same time, the war in Indochina has also brought serious losses in manpower and material resources to the French people.

The French expeditionary force gained some initial successes due to its raids against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but then began to suffer defeats year after year, despite the fact that the United States supplied all weapons: tanks, airplanes, ammunition, and other military equipment and military supplies, and the amount of these things has been increasing in recent years. It may be useful to cite some materials on the losses of the French expeditionary force in Indochina, which are all materials from speeches in the French National Assembly that are known to everyone.

These losses are: more than 100,000 dead and wounded, and the losses are constantly increasing. The war in Indochina has cost France more than two trillion francs. According to figures published in the May 1954 issue of the American magazine "Reader's Digest," "the money France has spent on eight years of war is almost equal to the amount of economic and military aid it has received from the United States."

Not too long ago, General Navarre's plan was still heavily publicized, and the U.S. Secretary of State said last year about this plan: "The war in Indochina will be won next year, i.e., within one year of 1954." In another statement made by a representative of the State Department in February of this year, there was the following passage: "We have signed off on General Navarre's plan and believe that this plan will succeed." However, in a short time, the idea that such a plan would achieve victory has been shattered. It must be admitted that this fact is instructive.

II. On the Political Issues of Indochina

I have talked above about the war in Indochina and the consequences of the war. However, it should be admitted that the issue of restoring peace in Indochina cannot be limited to military issues alone. Obviously, to establish a lasting peace in Indochina, it is necessary to resolve political issues. The Soviet delegation has repeatedly pointed this out in its speech supporting the proposals submitted to the conference for discussion by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

In this regard, two basic issues are of particular significance. The first issue is the relationship between France and the Indochinese countries. The second issue is the internal political situation of the Indochinese countries.

The Soviet delegation believes that the position expressed here by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the issue of its relationship with France has created the necessary preconditions for a friendly resolution of the relationship between the parties concerned, as long as France is also willing to resolve the issue in this way.

We have also heard here that France has expressed its readiness to recognize the independence of Vietnam and other Indochinese countries, and to provide due guarantees for their sovereignty and national interests. On the other hand, we also know that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has expressed its readiness to study the issue of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam joining the French Union based on the principle of free will. Since both sides say that it is possible to resolve the issue of their relationship on the basis of recognizing the principles of national freedom and independence, it seems that resolving this issue should not encounter insurmountable obstacles. The official representatives of the King of Cambodia and the King of Laos have said here that the issue of independence was supposedly completely resolved as early as 1949. As for the representative of the Bao Dai government, he cited some clauses. These clauses have not been signed by anyone and are obviously still hidden in his pocket. The lack of credibility of these arguments has long been discussed by everyone. It can be said that these arguments are not believed by others anywhere.

For example, the U.S. House of Representatives Special Investigating Mission issued a report on May 12, 1953, on its visit to Pakistan, India, Thailand, and Indochina, which said the following about the situation in Indochina:

"Although the French say they are prepared to grant independence, many Indochinese say that the unease and inability to more strongly support their government is due to the fact that the people do not have enough confidence either in their rulers or in France's intention to grant genuine independence..."

These words were said last spring.

In another report submitted by the U.S. House of Representatives Special Investigating Mission on January 29, 1954, on the results of its visit to Southeast Asian countries, it was pointed out once again that the Indochinese countries did not have "political independence."

These statements made by the U.S. investigating mission last year and this year are noteworthy because, although these statements are in fact permeated with ideas hostile to the Indochinese people's liberation movement, they affirm some facts.

However, even more important are those ordinary and well-known facts about the Indochinese situation.

No one can deny that the main force defending Dien Bien Phu was not the French army, nor the Vietnamese army, but the armies of various foreigners who were conscripted there. The vast majority of the defenders of Dien Bien Phu were people who had no relationship with either France or Vietnam. Look, these people are defending the interests of Vietnam, although the Vietnamese people did not ask them to do so.

What we see in the army of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a completely different situation. There are no foreigners in the army of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam except for Vietnamese people. All attempts to spread rumors that there are foreigners in these armies are obviously deceptive. Is this not enough to prove which side the Vietnamese people are on? This kind of fact shatters the attempts to diminish the significance of the national liberation movement.

Let's take another recent example.

Not long ago, in May, the Bao Dai government mobilized Vietnamese people to enlist in order to expand its army. You know what happened as a result of this. As a result of the mobilization, the number of people who enlisted accounted for only 10% of the number of people who were conscripted, and 90% of the people who were conscripted were unwilling to join the army of the Bao Dai government. It may be useful to mention a piece of news published in the British "Observer" two days ago. This news said that the Bao Dai Vietnamese army is currently "losing more recruits due to desertion and passive resistance than it is actually recruiting." Is it not enough to prove with these current facts that the Vietnamese people are unwilling to continue to be under the Bao Dai regime, but want to take a completely different path and more actively support their democratic republic?

In this case, what does continuing the colonial war in Indochina mean? It does not mean anything other than further deepening the contradiction between France and the people of the Indochinese countries. At the same time, the statements of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the government of France prove that it is possible to reach a consensus to resolve the issue of the relationship between France and Vietnam and between France and other countries in Indochina. If the French government is truly committed to restoring the independence of the Indochinese countries, then there is no reason to continue the war in Indochina in the current situation, because important preconditions for a friendly resolution of the relationship with each other have been met. Now, it is possible to resolve this issue on terms that are honorable for both parties. In any case, no one can say that the interests of the French nation require the continuation of the war in Indochina. On the contrary, we believe that denying or refusing to negotiate with the true representatives of the Vietnamese people on this issue is contrary to the interests of the French nation.

The resolution of the internal political problems of Vietnam and other countries in Indochina is also of great significance.

We have heard here the Bao Dai representative's claims on resolving the internal political problems of Vietnam. The Bao Dai government also talks about free elections in Vietnam. But according to the Bao Dai government's proposal, Vietnam must only hold such elections at such a time that the elections can guarantee the maintenance of the existing Bao Dai regime, and the lack of authority of the Bao Dai regime is a well-known fact. In fact, such a regime does not need universal suffrage at all. Elections are dangerous for it. What this regime relies on is not the people, but foreign bayonets.

Speaking of this, it may be useful to mention a passage about the Bao Dai government that a prestigious French figure like Daladier said in the French National Assembly on March 5, 1954:

"This government does not have the trust of the people. The following facts prove this: it can only conduct comical provincial and municipal elections in areas like Hue, which has 250,000 to 300,000 residents. Only 7,000 or 8,000 people are eligible to vote, and these people did not vote for the Bao Dai Emperor's candidates."

Here I would also like to mention a sentence that the British "Spectator" magazine said a few days ago: "At this stage, if free elections were held in Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh would undoubtedly defeat Bao Dai."

The opinion published by "French Observer" magazine on June 3 is a good interpretation of the above. This magazine made the following evaluation of the current situation in Vietnam:

"The attitude of hostility towards Bao Dai is even more intense because he has not fulfilled his promises in domestic affairs, such as eradicating corruption, implementing land reform, and implementing labor laws. The living standards of workers are 60% lower than in 1939. Censorship of newspapers is more severe than ever."

The above-mentioned news (and there is much more of this kind of news) proves that the internal political situation in the Vietnamese region occupied by the French army is fraught with crises, because the current government has no connection with the people and does not represent the interests of the people at all. The proposal for free elections put forward by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is very important for truly improving the political and economic situation in Vietnam. What the U.S. Secretary of State said not long ago that the conditions in Vietnam are not mature and that he does not agree to free elections in Indochina cannot prove that he is willing to resolve the internal political problems of Vietnam and other countries in Indochina. However, the Vietnamese people demand that free elections be held in the near future to ensure the establishment of a single democratic government for the whole of Vietnam on the basis of universal free elections. The Geneva Conference cannot remain silent on this demand of the Vietnamese people.

The Geneva Conference cannot be silent on this issue. However, this is primarily related to the French government, which should express its attitude towards the issue of free elections in Vietnam and other countries in Indochina.

It goes without saying that holding free elections requires compliance with certain conditions. It is necessary to allow the Vietnamese people to take this matter into their own hands, and to guarantee the freedom of activities of all patriotic parties and social organizations in the preparation and holding of universal free elections.

This will be the best and most effective way to restore the unity of Vietnam. Such measures must also be taken in other countries in Indochina. Before free elections are held, all foreign troops must withdraw from the territory of the Indochinese countries. For this reason, it naturally requires a proper solution to the military problems discussed at the Geneva Conference.

The Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to mention the main political issues that need to be resolved regarding the three countries of Indochina. Among these issues, the first is the issue of establishing new relations between France and the three countries of Indochina on the basis of the principle of truly recognizing the national independence and freedom of the Indochinese people. Among these issues, there is also the issue of conducting free elections in Vietnam and other countries in Indochina, and these free elections must be able to achieve the reunification of the three countries of Indochina and the establishment of authoritative democratic governments as soon as possible. If we hope to guarantee the re-establishment of a solid and reliable peace in Indochina, then we cannot put aside the resolution of these issues.

Now direct contact has been established in Geneva between the two sides on issues of a military nature. As we have recently agreed together, this contact must also be established locally in Indochina. We should study the results of these direct talks at the conference.

In addition, it is necessary to discuss some important political issues, the resolution of which will make it possible to establish the much-needed peace in all countries of Indochina. Needless to say, establishing direct contact between the two sides will also be of great significance for the resolution of political issues.

The Soviet delegation believes that in addition to reviewing the military issues currently under discussion at the conference, it is also necessary to:

(1) No longer delay the discussion of the political issues that need to be resolved due to the situation caused by Indochina. To this end, we can adopt a procedure of parallel discussion of military and political issues, with meetings discussing military and political issues held in rotation.

(2) First discuss the following issues: granting sovereignty and independence to the three countries of Indochina; holding free elections in these countries; and withdrawing all foreign troops from the territory of Indochina.

(3) Guarantee the establishment of direct contact between representatives of both sides to discuss those political issues that may be of positive significance and contribute to reaching corresponding agreements on these issues.

The Soviet delegation will make every effort to promote the early discussion of military and political issues. We hope that all participants of the Geneva Conference will make every effort to promote the discussion of these issues, because only in this way can we restore a solid and lasting peace in Indochina.

Today, we have listened to the speech of the head of the French delegation, who said that the Geneva Conference has made some achievements on the road to peace. The significance of this speech depends on the efforts that the French delegation will make for this in the future. (Xinhua News Agency, Geneva)

### 在日内瓦会议六月八日会议上  莫洛托夫外长的发言

1954-06-10

专栏：

    在日内瓦会议六月八日会议上
    莫洛托夫外长的发言主席先生、代表先生们！
    恢复印度支那和平是日内瓦会议的重要任务。印度支那各国人民对日内瓦会议寄予希望，指望它能对保证越南、寮国、高棉三国人民的和平、独立、自由与统一的事业作出贡献。全世界人民都同情印度支那各国人民的民族解放运动。他们争取民族独立和自由的斗争应当得到这个会议的承认。日内瓦会议的参加者负有促成在印度支那尽速停止敌对行动并建立持久巩固的和平的重大责任。
    然而，不能不注意到，显然并不是所有的会议参加者都已同样地理解到了自己的责任的。在日内瓦会议会内会外发生的以及与这个会议同时发生的一切，都可以说明这一点。人们产生了一种印象：并不是所有的与会者都关心尽速恢复印度支那的和平的。的确，有的人可以来参加日内瓦会议，但他的任务并不是恢复印度支那和平，而是证明不可能就印度支那停战问题达成协议。而且那些急于证明不可能达成协议的人并不是简单地在拖延印度支那战争，并且事实上还在策划进一步扩大战争，虽然这有其一切危险的后果。
    事实证明，有些国家的政府不但不想恢复印度支那和平，反而企图策划进一步扩大印度支那战争，并搜罗更多的人参加这一战争。我们不能忽视这种与美国国务院有密切关系的计划。
    这从下列事实可以得到证明：有人在为建立一个以美国为首的所谓“东南亚”军事集团而不断奔忙，参加这一集团的将有一些殖民国家和它们的最忠顺的附庸国。美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚和新西兰在华盛顿举行的军事会议说明这一点。泰国政府的行动也属于这类事实，它显然受外国侵略集团的指使而力图阻挠印度支那问题在日内瓦会议上得到解决。泰国建议在联合国安全理事会之下设立一个监督印度支那边境情况的委员会，这就是企图预先找出某些借口以便名义上由联合国而实际上是由美国来干涉印度支那的内政，这一建议是为了破坏在研究解决恢复印度支那和平的具体问题的日内瓦会议上的信心。
    我们同样不能忽视，某些国家的侵略集团害怕日内瓦会议会在和平解决印度支那问题上取得某些积极的结果。在这种情况下，苏联代表团认为必须强调指出这一会议对停止印度支那的敌对行动和恢复印度支那的和平所负有的责任。
    至于苏联，它并不把在印度支那停止敌对行动的问题看作是今后继续战争、或者甚至扩大战争的短期喘息机会，而是看作是巩固和平的建立。正因为这样，我们才认为，必须在日内瓦会议上既讨论军事问题，也讨论政治问题。
  一、关于停止敌对行动问题
    在着手讨论印度支那问题时，曾经达成过一项协议，即从军事问题开始，以后再讨论解决印度支那问题中的政治问题。现在是时候了，应该将最近四周以来对军事问题的讨论的结果加以归纳，并不再拖延讨论印度支那的政治问题，因为在讨论过程中已证明，这两类问题是密切关联的。
    越南民主共和国代表团和法国代表团都提出了关于停止印度支那敌对行动的建议。在讨论过程中，中华人民共和国代表团提出了关于停止敌对行动协定的基本原则的建议。在讨论这些建议时证明，在若干问题上，与会者的观点有着某种协调的迹象。
    这些问题中首先包括下列问题：交战双方的一切武装力量必须同时在印度支那全境内停止敌对行动。虽然在会议上在这方面还提出了一些保留，然而大家知道，关于这个问题我们已经达成协议。
    鉴于印度支那的复杂的军事情况，要停止敌对行动，就要求先解决双方军队集结地区的问题。这一问题除了由双方进行直接的谈判外，别无其他解决办法。根据五月二十九日会议上所达成的协议，双方军事代表建立了接触。双方军事代表现已在日内瓦进行接触了。同时还认为，必须在印度支那当地建立这种接触。现已开始讨论调整地区和双方军队相应地重新集结问题，这是解决印度支那问题的一个重要步骤。
    在讨论过程中也已肯定，所有日内瓦会议的参加者在原则上同意越南民主共和国所提出的建议，即在印度支那停止敌对行动后，不得从外面将新的军队和各种军事人员以及各种类型的武器和弹药运入印度支那。这是可以理解的，因为，如果不采取措施防止从外面将军队、武器和弹药运入印度支那，任何关于停止敌对行动的协定都可能变成一张废纸。否则，敌对行动的停止就可能被利用作为暂短的喘息机会来积蓄力量和再度挑起战争，也许可能是更大规模的战争。
    与会者对设立由双方代表组成的、监督停止敌对行动协定条款的履行的混合委员会也没有什么怀疑。这种委员会之所以有重大作用甚至从以下的事实来看也是很明显的，这就是：直接有关方面对履行上述协定负有主要的责任，如果直接有关方面不愿履行已达成的协定，那末就没有其他任何人能够保证所签订的协定能起应有的效果。
    必须建立国际监察来监察在印度支那停止敌对行动协定的条款的履行问题已经过特别详尽的讨论。所有代表团都同意，为了建立这种国际监察，必须建立适当的有威信的国际机构。在这个问题上，我还必须讲几句话，因为代表团之间在这方面的立场还有很大的分歧。
    大家知道，苏联代表团是以肯定的态度考虑了法国的建议的，即：日内瓦会议的参加者要承担保证停止印度支那敌对行动协定的履行的责任。其他代表团也表示必须要有保证，虽然还不曾对这个问题的各个方面都加以充分的考虑。
    但是在有些问题上，代表团之间存在着分歧。
    这是些什么问题呢？
    首先必须谈的是对履行协定的国际监察问题。
    大家知道，苏联建议由印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克与巴基斯坦四国组成中立国监察委员会。四国中的两国——印度与巴基斯坦和一方法国有外交关系，另两国——波兰与捷克斯洛伐克和另一方越南民主共和国有外交关系。苏联代表团认为：由上述成员组成的国际委员会会具有必需的权威，并能保证在这一国际机构的工作中不会有片面性和偏袒某一方的情形。有人反对波兰和捷克斯洛伐克这样的国家参加这个委员会，硬说它们由于思想上的原因，不能在这里站在中立的立场上，这种反对是毫无根据的。在不小的程度上，倒可以对于资本主义国家提出这种反对。这里他们显然忘记了，上述结论是害人又害己的结论，不必再加以宣扬了。也不能忘记，按照朝鲜停战协定，也成立了有波兰和捷克斯洛伐克代表参加的中立国委员会。目前，诬蔑朝鲜中立国委员会的企图显然是毫无根据的，只能被认为是阻挠在这个重要问题上达成协议的企图。关于国际监察委员会以及双方代表混合委员会的任务与职权问题，并没有达成适当的协议。这两个委员会的相互关系应该根据它们两者职权的不同来决定。
    中立国委员会的主要任务是：
    保证停止运入印度支那新的部队和各种军事人员以及各种类型的武器和弹药；
    监察双方履行关于规定军事分界线及建立非军事区的条款；
    监察在进行地区调整时双方军队的转移；监察双方遣返战俘和被拘的平民的工作；
    根据混合委员会或某一方的请求，调查破坏关于在非军事区停止敌对行动的协定的事实，并向双方提出的关于制止破坏行为的建议。
    混合委员会的任务是：保证为履行停止敌对行动的协定条款而就地实行具体措施。这些措施将涉及下列问题：
    监督各地同时停火；
    履行调整地区的计划，重新集结双方的军队；
    通过双方军事代表之间的谈判，解决有关破坏协定条款的其他问题。
    现在出现了一个问题：如果这两个委员会的内部或是它们之间在这个或是那个问题上没有达成协议，那么该怎么办呢？换句话说，一旦各个委员会里发生分歧时，向哪个机构去申诉呢？如果从上述建议出发，即某些国家应当保证印度支那停止敌对行动协定的履行，那就不难回答这一问题了。这就是说，如有必要时保证的国家就成为接受申诉的机关。它们将有责任采取为大家所同意的适当的措施，以制止破坏上述协定的情况或制止破坏这种协定的威胁。
    不能不承认，关于监督印度支那停止敌对行动协定条款的履行的机构的性质和职权，尚需作进一步的研究。但如果我们大家同意某些出发点，那末就这一重要问题达成协议是不会有太大的困难的。
    在讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的过程中产生了一个问题：关于停止敌对行动和规定一些适当的停战条件的决定，是不是适用于印度支那所有的三个国家呢？与会者在这一点上发生了分歧。苏联代表团的出发点是：我们的任务是恢复整个印度支那的和平，柏林会议的公报也是这样规定的。
    这里不能忽略的是：印度支那所有三个国家——越南、高棉、寮国——的事件产生的基本原因是完全相同的。印度支那的事件说明，越南、寮国和高棉所进行的都是反对外国殖民统治的民族解放斗争。参加这一斗争的不仅是这些或那些武装部队，而且是人民自己。只有这样才能解释为什么印度支那民族解放运动规模如此大，如此有力。当然，不能不看到印度支那各国的民族解放运动的不同之处。
    例如，在越南，全国有四分之三的领土已不在保大政府委任的官员的统治之下。大家知道，越南北部以及中部和南部广大的土地已由越南民主共和国政府的机构管理。至于寮国，也有约一半的国土已不受寮国王国政府的机构管理了。在高棉，不受高棉王国当局控制的地区的面积虽然较印度支那其他地区为小，然而这里的民族解放斗争也在日益发展。可见，如果否认寮国和高棉有民族解放斗争存在，而认为这里所发生的事件是某些外部因素的影响，譬如说是越南武装部队的干涉，那是不正确的。越南民主共和国代表团首席代表已令人信服地驳斥了这种说法。
    在场的寮国王国和高棉王国的代表对这一问题抱着另外一种意见。但是，在我们这里的保大政府代表不也是想否认越南民族解放运动的存在吗，虽然，这些论调显然是站不住脚的。可以完全有根据地说，这种论调本身就证明了：它既没有反映实际情况，也没有反映和本国人民的真正关系，这种论调只是毫无根据地否认大家都知道的事实。
    会议的某些参加者企图使我们相信，建立印度支那各国——越南、寮国和高棉的独立的任务似乎已经完全解决了，这些国家的民族要求已经得到满足了。高棉王国的代表为此引证了一九四九年和一九五三年与法国签订的协定。寮国王国代表也在这里引证了一九四九年和法国签订的协定。最后，保大政府的代表也引证了不久前和法国之间的协定，然而，这一协定至今仍未签字，因而也未公布。所有这些声明都不能使人信任，因为它们过去和现在都没有保证印度支那各国的独立。在这种情况下，便可以了解为什么亚洲国家，包括印度、巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚和缅甸，几乎没有一个认为这些声明有什么了不起的意义。只有这才能解释为什么亚洲国家不愿和保大越南、寮国王国和高棉王国建立外交关系。此外，还可以举出很注意印度支那问题的法国和美国的著名政治和社会人士的言论来，他们承认在印度支那三国内都有民族解放运动，同时指出法国最终必须保证越南、寮国和高棉独立。
    印度支那的战争已经进行八年了。法国政府作了不少打算，想以军事手段来达到自己的目的。但是，这并没有得到任何结果。
    从越南民主共和国成立以来，法国就实施过不少的计划，要在军事上击败越南军队，扼杀越南民主共和国，从而恢复殖民制度。这就使得印度支那人民遭受了许多损失。同时，印度支那的战争也为法国人民带来了严重的人力和物力的损失。
    法国远征军因对越南民主共和国进行突袭而获得一些初步成就，但此后就开始一年一年地遭到失败，尽管美国供应了一切武器：坦克、飞机、弹药以及其他军事装备和军用物资，而且这些东西的数量近年来不断增加。这里不妨引证一些关于法国远征军在印度支那的损失的材料，这些都是大家都知道的法国国民议会的发言中的材料。
    这种损失是：死伤十余万人，而且损失还在不断增加。印度支那战争使法国耗费了二万亿法郎以上。根据美国杂志“读者文摘”一九五四年五月号所发表的数字，“八年战争使法国所耗费的金钱，差不多和它从美国所得到的经济援助和军事援助数目相等”。
    在不太久以前，纳瓦尔将军的计划还大受宣扬，美国国务卿去年曾就这个计划说：“印度支那战争将在明年、即一九五四年一年之内胜利结束。”在国务院代表今年二月发表的另一个声明里，有这样一段话：“我们已在纳瓦尔将军的计划上签了字，并且相信这个计划将能成功。”然而，曾几何时，妄想这一类计划取得胜利的主意归于破灭了。不能不承认，这个事实是富有教益的。
    二、关于印度支那的政治
          问题
    我上面谈了谈印度支那的战事，以及战事的后果。然而，应该承认，恢复印度支那和平的问题不能仅仅局限于军事问题。显然，要确立印度支那的持久和平，就需要解决政治问题。苏联代表团在发言支持越南民主共和国代表团提交会议讨论的建议时，就曾一再指出这一点。
    在这方面有两个基本问题具有特别重大的意义。第一个问题就是法国和印度支那各国之间的相互关系问题。第二个问题是印度支那各国的内部政治形势问题。
    苏联代表团认为，越南民主共和国就和法国之间的相互关系问题在此间所表明的立场，已为友好地解决有关各方之间的相互关系问题创造了必要的前提，只要法国也愿意这样来解决问题。
    我们在这里也曾听到有人说，法国表示准备承认越南和其他印度支那国家的独立，并对其主权和民族利益作应有的保证。另一方面，我们也知道，越南民主共和国政府表示，准备研究越南民主共和国根据自由意志的原则加入法兰西联邦的问题。既然双方都说，是可能在承认民族自由和独立的原则的基础上解决相互关系的问题，那末，解决这一问题似乎不应该会碰到不可克服的障碍。高棉国王和寮国国王的正式代表在这里曾经说，独立问题据说早在一九四九年就已完全解决了。而保大政府的代表，却引证了一些条文。这种条文谁也没有在上面签过字，显然，仍然还藏在他的口袋里的。这些论调的不足置信，大家早已谈过了。可以说这些论调是到处得不到别人相信的。
    例如，美国众议院特别调查团在一九五三年五月十二日发表了关于访问巴基斯坦、印度、泰国和印度支那的报告，其中对于印度支那的情况是这样说的：
    “尽管法国人说，它准备给予独立，而许多印度支那人却说：不安和不能更有力地支持他们的政府，是由于人民无论是对他们的统治者或是对法国准备给予真正独立的意图都没有足够的信心……”
    这些话还是在去年春天说的。
    在众议院特别调查团一九五四年一月二十九日所提出的访问东南亚各国的结果的另一个报告中，再一次指出：印度支那国家没有“政治上的独立”。
    美国的调查团去年和今年的这些声明是值得注意的，因为这些声明虽然实际上浸透了敌视印度支那人民解放运动的思想，但它们却肯定了一些事实。
    然而，具有更为重要的意义的是那些普通的、大家都知道的关于印度支那形势的事实。
    谁也不能否认防守奠边府的主要不是法国人的军队，也不是越南人的军队，而是被征集到那里去的各种外国人的军队。奠边府的守军中绝大多数是和法国及越南都毫无关系的人。大家看吧，就是这些人在保卫越南的利益，虽然越南人民并没有请他们这样干。
    我们在越南民主共和国的军队中所看到的是完全不同的情况。越南民主共和国的军队中除越南人外，没有任何外国人。一切想散布这些军队中有外国人的谣言的企图，都显然是骗人的。难道这还不足以证明越南人民是站在那一方面的吗？这一类事实粉碎了那种想缩小民族解放运动的意义的企图。
    我们再举一个最近的例子。
    不久以前，在五月间，保大政府动员越南人入伍，以扩大自己的军队。这件事的结果如何，你们是知道的。动员的结果，入伍的人只占被征召的人数的百分之十，而百分之九十的被征召的人不愿加入保大政府的军队。不妨提一下两天以前英国“观察家报”所发表的一条消息。这条消息说，保大越南军目前“因逃跑和消极抵抗而丧失的新兵比这次实际征召到的人还要多”。难道当前这些事实还不足以证明越南人民不愿继续处于保大政权下，而想走完全另外一条路，更加积极支持他们的民主共和国吗？
    在这种情况下，继续印度支那的殖民战争究竟是意味着什么呢？除了进一步加深法国与印度支那各国人民的矛盾以外，再没有任何其他意义了。而同时，越南民主共和国政府的发言和法国政府的发言，证明有可能取得一致的意见来解决法国与越南之间以及法国与印度支那其他国家之间的关系问题的。如果法国政府真正致力于恢复印度支那各国的独立，那末在目前的情况下就没有理由继续印度支那战争，因为友好地解决彼此关系的问题已具备了重要前提了。现在，有可能在对于双方都是光荣的条件下解决这个问题。无论如何，谁也不能说法国民族的利益要求继续印度支那战争。相反，我们认为，否定或拒绝与越南人民真正的代表就这一问题进行谈判是违反法国民族的利益的。
    越南和印度支那其他国家内部政治问题的解决也有重要的意义。
    我们在这里听到了保大代表对解决越南内部政治问题的主张，保大政府也来谈什么越南境内的自由选举。但根据保大政府的建议，越南必须只在这样的时候进行这样的选举，即选举要能保证维持现存的保大政权，而保大政权的缺乏权威是众所周知的事实。其实，这样的政权根本不需要普选。选举对它是危险的。这种政权所依靠的不是人民而是外国的刺刀。
    谈到这里不妨提一提像达拉第这样一位有声望的法国人士一九五四年三月五日在法国国民议会所说的关于保大政府的一段话：
    “这个政府没有得到人民的信任。下面的事实证实了这一点，就是它只能在类似有二十五万到三十万居民的顺化这种地区搞搞滑稽的省选和市选。有选举权的只有七八千人，而且这些人也并未投票拥护保大皇上的候选人。”
    这里我还提一提英国“旁观者”杂志前几天所说的一句话：“现阶段在越南举行自由选举，胡志明无疑会战胜保大。”
    “法兰西观察家”周刊六月三日发表的意见，是对上述的话的一个不坏的解释。这个杂志对目前越南的形势作了如下的评价：
    “敌视保大的态度之所以更加激烈，是因为他没有履行在内政方面的诺言，如根除贪污，实行土地改革，实施劳工法等。工人的生活水平比一九三九年降低了百分之六十。报刊检查比任何时候都来得厉害。”
    以上所引证的消息（这类消息还多得很）证明，法国军队占领下的越南地区的内部政治情况是危机重重的，因为目前的这个政府和人民没有联系，而且一点也不代表人民的利益。越南民主共和国提出的举行自由选举的建议，对于真正地改善越南的政治和经济情况是非常重要的。不久以前，美国国务卿所说的关于越南条件没有成熟并不赞成在印度支那举行自由选举的话，不能证明他是愿意解决越南和印度支那其他国家的内部政治问题的。但是，越南人民要求在最近举行自由选举，以保证在普遍自由选举的基础上成立一个全越南唯一的民主政府，日内瓦会议对越南人民这个要求是不能避不答复的。
    日内瓦会议不能对这个问题缄默不言。但是，这首先和法国政府有关，法国政府应当对于越南和印度支那其他国家的自由选举问题表明它的态度。
    不言而喻，举行自由选举是要求遵守一定的条件的。必须要使越南人民把这件事掌握在自己手中，而且要在筹备和举行普遍自由选举时保证各爱国党派和社会团体活动的自由。
    这将是恢复越南的统一的最好和最有效的途径。在印度支那其他国家中也必须采取这种措施。在进行自由选举以前，印度支那各国境内所有的外国军队必须撤退，为此，自然要求日内瓦会议上所讨论的军事问题有一个适当的解决办法。
    苏联代表团认为有必要提一提需要解决的关于印度支那三个国家的主要政治问题。在这些问题中，首先是关于在真正承认印度支那人民的民族独立和自由这个原则的基础上建立法国和印度支那三国的新关系的问题。在这一类问题中还有在越南和印度支那其他国家中进行自由选举的问题，而这种自由选举要能够尽速实现印度支那三国的重新统一和建立有威望的民主政府。如果我们希望保证重新建立印度支那的巩固的、可靠的和平，那末我们就不能将这些问题的解决搁置起来。
    现在在日内瓦双方已就军事性质的问题建立了直接接触。必须如我们最近所共同认为的那样，在印度支那当地也建立这种接触。我们应当在会议上研究这些直接会谈的结果。
    此外，必须讨论这样一些重要的政治问题，这些问题的解决将使在印度支那所有国家建立极为必需的和平成为可能。不用说，由双方建立直接接触，对于政治问题的解决也将有重要意义。
    苏联代表团认为，除了审查会议现在讨论的军事问题之外，还必须：
      （一）不再拖延讨论由于印度支那造成的局势而需要解决的政治问题。为此，我们可以采取一种军事问题和政治问题平行讨论的程序，讨论军事问题和政治问题的会议轮流举行。
      （二）首先讨论下列诸问题：给予印度支那三个国家主权和独立；在这些国家里举行自由选举以及自印度支那境内撤退一切外国军队。
      （三）保证建立双方代表之间的直接接触，以讨论可能具有积极意义以及有助于就这些问题达成相应协议的那些政治问题。
    苏联代表团将尽一切努力，促进军事和政治问题的及早讨论。我们希望，日内瓦会议的全体参加者都能全力设法来推进这些问题的讨论，因为只有这样才能恢复印度支那的巩固和持久的和平。
    今天，我们听取了法国代表团团长的发言，他说，日内瓦会议已在走向和平的道路上取得了一些成就。这个发言的意义究竟有多大，要看法国代表团今后为此而作的努力。　（新华社日内瓦讯）
