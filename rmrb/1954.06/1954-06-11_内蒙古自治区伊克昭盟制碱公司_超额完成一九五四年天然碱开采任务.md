    Yike Zhao League Soda Ash Company in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    Exceeds 1954 Natural Soda Ash Mining Task
    The Yike Zhao League Soda Ash Company in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has exceeded its 1954 natural soda ash mining task.
    The mining of natural soda ash is a seasonal production. Natural soda ash crystallizes in alkali lakes every winter, and the mining time is limited to a very short period in winter and spring. In the past, due to poor management and failure to grasp the key to seasonal production, the task was often not completed. This year, the company strengthened its leadership in mining work, mining a total of 74 million catties of natural soda ash, exceeding the original mining task by more than 14 million catties. In the past, the alkali content was only about 30% to 40%. This year, the lowest alkali content of the mined soda ash reached 50%. On the basis of improving quality, the cost per catty this year was reduced by 200 yuan compared to last year; the cost reduction alone saved the state 8 billion yuan in funds. The reduction in the cost of natural soda ash will also directly promote the reduction in the cost of soda ash-using industries.

    内蒙古自治区伊克昭盟制碱公司
    超额完成一九五四年天然碱开采任务
    内蒙古自治区伊克昭盟制碱公司超额完成了一九五四年天然碱的开采任务。
    天然碱的开采是一种季节性生产。每年冬天碱湖天然碱才结晶，开采时间只限于冬春两季中一段很短的时间。过去由于管理不善，抓不住季节生产的关键，往往完不成任务，今年该公司加强了开采工作的领导，共开采出天然碱七千四百多万斤，比原定开采任务超出了一千四百多万斤。含碱率过去只有百分之三、四十左右，今年开采的含碱率最低的也达到百分之五十。在提高质量的基础上，今年比去年每斤还降低了二百元的成本；只降低成本一项，就为国家节省了八十亿元资金。天然碱成本的降低，对于用碱工业成本的降低也将起着直接的促进作用。
