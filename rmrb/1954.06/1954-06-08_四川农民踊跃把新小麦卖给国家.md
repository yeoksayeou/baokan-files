Sichuan farmers, after harvesting wheat, have been actively selling their dried and cleaned wheat to the state. According to statistics from ten special districts and two cities, by May 21st, farmers had sold over 72 million jin of wheat to the state. In Wangjia Township, Nanbu County, the first village held a meeting of cadres before purchasing the new wheat to summarize the achievements made after the implementation of the grain planned purchase last winter. After the meeting, the cadres went to the farmers to promote the policy. The total amount of wheat sold to the state by the farmers in the village, plus the wheat paid for the summer grain tax, was 62,000 jin. Farmers in the third village of Qingjiang Township, Jintang County, beat drums and gongs on May 18th to sell 16,700 jin of wheat to the state.

Farmers participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations generally played an exemplary role in the planned purchase of wheat. The Qilong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ziyang County, after setting aside wheat for summer grain tax and self-use, sold the remaining 7,000 jin of wheat to the state. The Tan Guoxing mutual aid group in Huitang Township, Zhongjiang County, sold 6,750 jin of wheat to the state, accounting for 65.4 percent of the group's total wheat harvest.

After selling wheat, farmers in various places actively purchased means of production and deposited the surplus money in state banks, preparing to invest it in production in a planned way. The Yan Qingrong mutual aid group in Dayi County purchased a batch of fertilizers, farm tools, and a sprayer after selling wheat. The Xu Yingliang mutual aid group in the first village of Wangjia Township, Nanbu County, added farm tools, repaired a large manure pond, and deposited 1.5 million yuan in the bank after selling wheat.

    四川农民踊跃把新小麦卖给国家
    【本报讯】　四川省农民收割小麦以后，纷纷把晒干扬净的小麦卖给国家。据十个专区和二个市的统计，到五月二十一日止，农民卖给国家的小麦已有七千二百多万斤。南部县王家乡第一村在收购新小麦以前，曾召开干部会，总结了去年冬季实行粮食计划收购以后取得的成绩。会后，干部们分头向农民进行了宣传，全村农民卖给国家的小麦加上夏征所交的小麦，共有六万二千斤。金堂县清江乡第三村的农民已在五月十八日敲着锣鼓，把一万六千七百斤小麦卖给国家。
    各地参加互助合作组织的农民在小麦计划收购中，一般都起了模范作用。资阳县骑龙农业生产合作社除留出夏征和自用的小麦外，已把其余的七千多斤小麦全部卖给国家。中江县会棚乡谭国兴互助联组卖给国家六千七百五十斤小麦，达全组小麦总收获量的百分之六十五点四。
    各地农民卖出小麦以后，都积极购买生产资料，并把余钱存入国家银行，准备有计划地投入生产。大邑县鄢清荣互助组卖出小麦以后，已买进一批肥料、农具和一架喷雾器。南部县王家乡第一村徐映良互助联组卖小麦以后，添置了农具，培修了一口大粪池，还存入银行一百五十万元。
