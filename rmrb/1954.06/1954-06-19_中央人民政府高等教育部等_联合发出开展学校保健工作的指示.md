The Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, and the Physical Culture and Sports Commission jointly issued a directive on carrying out school health work on June 11.

The directive first requires education, health, and sports departments at all levels of the People's Government to work together to improve school health work according to local conditions and circumstances, so that all teachers, students, and staff members truly recognize that emphasizing physical education and hygiene is a positive way to strengthen physical fitness. It is necessary to appropriately and closely combine students' study, life, and hygiene work with physical exercise, so as to cultivate all-round talent for the country.

The directive proposes that local People's Government education departments should strengthen their leadership over school health work. The education departments of each province (city) People's Government should, in accordance with the State Council of the Central People's Government's "Decision on Improving the Health of Students at All Levels of Schools," take the initiative to organize school health guidance committees in conjunction with health, sports, and other relevant departments to determine the specific guidelines and tasks of local school health work, which will be implemented by the education departments in conjunction with relevant departments, and checked regularly. Education departments at all levels of the People's Government should also formulate implementation plans in conjunction with health, sports, and other relevant departments based on these guidelines. The principal of the school should be responsible for leading the school's health work, and, as needed, organize a school health committee or assign responsibility to various relevant parties within the school. Local health departments should provide regular professional guidance, supervision, and inspection of health work in schools at all levels through the local school health guidance committee (areas that have not organized school health guidance committees should contact the cultural and educational departments). As for the health work of universities and colleges, in addition to strengthening administrative leadership by the school, the local health departments should also provide professional guidance. Regarding the grassroots health organizations within schools, universities and colleges should set up school clinics, secondary schools (including secondary technical schools and workers' and peasants' short-course middle schools) should generally set up health rooms, and their medical staff should be included in the school establishment. Large primary schools in large and medium-sized cities may also set up health rooms if conditions permit. General primary schools should set up health medicine kits (only equipped with several simple treatment and first-aid medicines and equipment), which will be operated under the guidance of local health departments by teachers who do not give up teaching work and have undergone short-term training. The principal should give appropriate consideration to the working hours of teachers responsible for health work and appropriately reduce their teaching or other work. Medical personnel in schools at all levels should have a certain work system and should implement the policy of "prevention first."

The directive believes that to carry out school health work, the patriotic health campaign in schools must first be carried out well. Schools at all levels should, according to the unified deployment of the local Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, do a good job in health propaganda and education, and improve environmental sanitation. Measures that affect students' health should be gradually improved as conditions permit. The time for students' study, rest, sleep, and sports and recreational activities should be arranged and guaranteed in accordance with the State Council of the Central People's Government's "Decision on Improving the Health of Students at All Levels of Schools." Secondary schools and above should set up isolation dormitories and dining halls as much as possible to prevent tuberculosis, or implement collectively run sanatoriums, etc. Primary schools should pay attention to early detection and prevention of infectious diseases that children are prone to. Local health departments should supervise and assist grassroots school health organizations to administer vaccinations to students on a regular basis. Schools should do a good job in daily cleanliness inspections and pay attention to cultivating children's hygiene habits. In addition, local health departments should pay attention to cultivating and improving the quality of school medical personnel, and hold various workshops or short-term training courses.
