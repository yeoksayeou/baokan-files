Xinhua News Agency, Geneva: The Geneva Conference held its fourteenth plenary session on the afternoon of the 11th to discuss the peaceful resolution of the Korean question. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov chaired the meeting.

As previously reported, the Soviet delegation put forward five proposals at the June 5th meeting, hoping to solidify the common principles expressed by the various delegations at previous meetings, as a basis for further consultations to resolve existing differences. This constructive effort by the Soviet delegation disrupted the timetable predetermined by the United States to interrupt the conference. According to available information, the U.S. delegation originally intended to use the excuse of so-called "appealing to world opinion" at the June 5th meeting to interrupt the conference. However, the presentation of the Soviet delegation's five proposals caught the U.S. delegation off guard and they did not dare rashly break off negotiations. After the last plenary session, the Western delegations used the excuse of consulting with their respective governments to cancel the originally scheduled restricted meeting on the 7th. In reality, the United States needed time to force its allies to submit to its strategy of interrupting the conference.

However, the five proposals of the Soviet delegation had a wide impact. It is generally believed that the Soviet delegation's willingness to negotiate and the principles contained in its proposals are beyond reproach. Unless willing to bear the responsibility of breaking the conference, there is no reason to oppose the Soviet delegation's proposals. Even the Western bourgeois newspapers admitted that the Soviet proposal had put the U.S. delegation in an embarrassing position of being unable to stop.

At the meeting on the 11th, the delegation of the People's Republic of China and the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea clearly expressed their support for the Soviet delegation's proposals of June 5th, and believed that the conference had no reason not to solidify the existing common ground, no reason to stop moving forward, and no reason not to continue discussions based on the Soviet delegation's proposals to seek agreement.

In contrast, the speeches of the representatives of Western countries were chaotic and self-contradictory. These representatives of Western countries succumbed to the U.S. strategy of sabotage, but did not dare to bear the responsibility of breaking the conference; they were unwilling to reach any agreement, but did not dare to openly oppose the principle of peaceful resolution of the Korean question in the Soviet proposals. Thus, they either sought excuses on technical issues or used the "authority of the United Nations" as a shield. Some representatives, in their speeches, on the one hand, dared not deny that they agreed with some of the principles in the Soviet proposals, but on the other hand, refused to accept them under the pretext of a lack of specific measures or different understandings of the principles, although they clearly knew that the Soviet delegation believed that after the common principles were established, it would be possible and beneficial to further negotiate specific solutions. However, in any case, the representatives of Western countries could not explain to public opinion: since there were already many points of commonality, why not continue the discussions and seek agreement, but instead say that the conference had "failed"?

At the meeting on the 11th, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, spoke first (full text published separately).

The next speaker was Canadian representative Ronning. Ronning began by defending the U.S. invasion of Korea under the name of the United Nations. Ronning said that he did so because he was afraid that others would misunderstand the position of the Canadian delegation. Ronning then talked about the five proposals made by the Soviet representative on June 5th. Although the Soviet delegation had given a clear explanation of these proposals, Ronning raised a lot of questions, attempting to confuse the essence of the matter.

When Ronning talked about the Soviet delegation's proposal on free elections, he expressed that he was "pleased" with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's delegation's proposal to hold elections throughout Korea based on the principle of proportionality. However, he then raised a series of questions that he himself said "could be considered technical," and said that if these questions could not be resolved, he could not agree to the Soviet delegation's proposals.

On the issue of establishing an all-Korea commission, Ronning also admitted that Molotov's proposal was "not unconvincing." He said: "It might even be acceptable to form this commission on the basis of each side occupying half." However, he then expressed doubt as to whether the all-Korea commission would become a "transitional government," although the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's proposal clearly stipulated that the task of the commission was to prepare and organize elections.

On the issue of withdrawing foreign troops, Ronning did not dare to oppose the principle of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea, but he refused to reach a principled agreement on the grounds that the United Nations forces and the Chinese People's Volunteers could not be treated the same way.

On the issue of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, Ronning expressed the hope to form a "truly neutral" commission, but he said that he would not agree to this principle until he knew the members and powers of the commission, although the Soviet proposal stated that the members and powers could be further negotiated after the principle was established. Ronning did not dare to say that the United Nations should supervise the elections, but he said that the conference's agreement on the issue of members should be acceptable to the United Nations.

Regarding the issue of guaranteeing the peaceful development of Korea by the countries most concerned about peace in the Far East, Ronning also admitted that "this is certainly a question that can be considered." However, he pretended not to understand what this guarantee meant and put aside this important issue.

Ronning expressed his willingness to see the conference reach an agreement on the principles for resolving the above-mentioned important issues, even if it was a limited agreement. However, he believed that an agreement could not be reached at present. Ronning finally said that he believed that it would be better to admit the differences to the world than to reach an agreement according to the Soviet delegation's proposals. Ronning, on the one hand, raised a lot of questions expressing the hope to get answers, but on the other hand, made such irresponsible remarks, which could only show that he neither hoped that the questions would be answered nor was willing to reach any agreement.

New Zealand representative McIntosh spoke next. In his speech, McIntosh could not but agree with the principles that free elections should be held in Korea, that such elections should be fairly supervised, that foreign troops should be withdrawn, and that the integrity of Korea should be internationally guaranteed. However, he then said that he did not know what benefits the conference would have at present in announcing to the world that agreements had been reached on these principles. He denied the necessity of a principled agreement with disagreements on specific issues, although everyone knew that a principled agreement would help further negotiate solutions to disagreements on specific issues.

After a fifteen-minute break, the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Nam Il, spoke first. (Full text published separately)

British representative Eden spoke next. Eden said he fully agreed with the views of the Canadian and New Zealand representatives. Eden did not dare to completely oppose the five proposals made by Molotov on June 5th, he only used the differences in methods and procedures to refuse to reach an agreement on principle issues.

Eden believed that there were two basic issues in the debate on the Korean issue. The first is the so-called "authority of the United Nations." Eden insisted that the United Nations has the right to continue to interfere in Korean affairs. However, everyone knows that this violates the Charter of the United Nations.

The second is the issue of free elections throughout Korea. Eden said that he agreed that Korea should be unified, and that this unification should be achieved through national free elections, but he unreasonably insisted that such elections would only be free under the supervision of the United Nations. Eden disagreed with withdrawing all foreign troops first, saying that this would cause a "vacuum." Eden's so-called "vacuum" is actually afraid that the Syngman Rhee clique would not be able to maintain its rule without the support of American bayonets. Eden also opposed the organization of international institutions to supervise elections according to the experience of the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. He actually wanted to oppose the participation of people's democratic countries in supervision. He said that if this goal could not be achieved, there was no hope of progress on this issue.

Eden finally said that he was prepared to seek every possibility of reaching an agreement, but there must be signs of a possible agreement. If the differences on the two main issues he raised could not be resolved, then the conference would have to admit that it could not complete its task, and he believed that the Korean issue should be handed back to the United Nations at that time. He believed that the existing Korean armistice should be guaranteed to remain valid under any circumstances, and that a political solution should be left for a later appropriate time. Eden's remarks can only show that, as one of the chairmen of the conference, he did not fulfill his due responsibilities to urge the conference to reach an agreement on the existing commonalities and continue to negotiate on the issues of disagreement, but instead followed the U.S. policy, which is to make the Geneva Conference fruitless on the Korean issue and open the door for the United Nations to continue to illegally interfere in Korean affairs.

Thai representative Prince Wan Waithayakon and Belgian representative Spaak spoke next. The Thai representative refused to accept Molotov's proposal, saying that it was not a concrete plan. The Belgian representative did not dare to openly reject Molotov's proposal, but refused to accept Molotov's proposal on the grounds that reaching an agreement only in principle could not solve the problem. But Molotov's proposal was originally to reach an agreement in principle, and specific issues could be further discussed.

French representative Bidault spoke next.

Bidault said that he had listened with interest and studied carefully the proposal of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on June 5th. He said he disagreed with the point in the Soviet proposal regarding the establishment of an all-Korea commission to prepare for and conduct free elections throughout Korea. But he vaguely stated that the French delegation agreed in principle that Korea should be unified as a free, independent, and democratic state; that elections should be held throughout Korea to form a single government that truly represents the entire Korea; that elections should be conducted in truly free and internationally supervised conditions; and that the solution to the Korean problem must anticipate the withdrawal of foreign troops. Bidault did not mention the international guarantee of the peaceful development of Korea, and advocated that once unification is achieved under normal circumstances, the United Nations must be invited to approve it.

After Bidault finished speaking, the chairman announced that the meeting would adjourn here. The date of the next meeting will be notified in the normal procedure. The meeting adjourned at 7:20 PM.

### 日内瓦会议继续讨论和平解决朝鲜问题  中朝两国代表团支持苏联建议  希望根据这一建议继续讨论寻求协议

    日内瓦会议继续讨论和平解决朝鲜问题
    中朝两国代表团支持苏联建议
    希望根据这一建议继续讨论寻求协议
    据新华社日内瓦讯：日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论十一日下午举行第十四次全体会议。苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫担任主席。
    前已报道，苏联代表团在六月五日会议上提出了五项建议，以期把历次会议上各国代表团所表示的共同原则确定下来，作为进一步协商解决现存分歧的基础。苏联代表团这一建设性的努力，打乱了美国预定的中断会议的时间表。据已获得的消息说，美国代表团原定在五日会议上以所谓“诉诸世界舆论”的借口来中断会议。但是苏联代表团的五项建议的提出使美国代表团措手不及，不敢贸然破裂谈判。上次全体会议以后，西方国家的代表团以请示本国政府为理由，取消了原定七日举行的限制性会议。实际上是美国需要时间来驱使它的盟国屈从于它的中断会议的策略。
    然而，苏联代表团的五项建议产生了广泛的影响。普遍认为，苏联代表团所采取的愿意协商的态度和它的建议中所包含的原则是无可非议的。除非甘愿承担破裂会议的责任，没有任何理由反对苏联代表团的建议。甚至西方资产阶级报纸也承认，苏联这一建议已使美国代表团处于欲罢不能的狼狈境地。
    在十一日的会议上，中华人民共和国代表团和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团明确地表示支持苏联代表团六月五日的建议，并认为会议没有任何理由不把已有的共同之点确定下来，没有任何理由停止前进，没有任何理由不根据苏联代表团的建议继续讨论，寻求协议。
    与此相反，西方国家的代表们的发言是混乱的，自相矛盾的。这些西方国家的代表们屈从于美国的破坏策略，但是又不敢承担破裂会议的责任；他们不愿达成任何协议，但又不敢公然反对苏联建议中的和平解决朝鲜问题的原则。于是他们不是在技术性的问题上找遁词，就是拿“联合国的权威”来作挡箭牌。有些代表在发言中一方面不敢不承认他们同意苏联建议中的某些原则，另一方面又以所谓缺乏具体办法或者以对原则的了解不同为借口来拒绝接受，虽然他们明明知道苏联代表团认为共同原则确定后可以而且有利于进一步协商具体解决办法。但是，无论如何，西方国家的代表们无法向公众舆论说明：既然已有不少共同之点，为什么不继续讨论下去，寻求协议，而偏偏要说会议“失败”呢？
    在十一日的会议上，中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来首先发言（全文另发）。
    接着发言的是加拿大代表罗宁。罗宁一开头就替美国以联合国名义侵略朝鲜的行为辩护。罗宁说，他这样做的目的是恐怕别人对加拿大代表团的立场发生误解。罗宁接着谈到苏联代表在六月五日提出的五项建议。虽然，苏联代表团对于这些建议已作了清楚的说明，罗宁却提出了一大堆问题，企图以此来混淆问题的实质。
    罗宁谈到苏联代表团关于自由选举的建议时表示，他对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团愿根据比例原则在全朝鲜举行选举的主张，“感到高兴”。然而，他又提出一连串他自己也说“可以被认为是技术性的问题”，并且说，如果这些问题不能解决，他就不能同意苏联代表团的建议。
      在建立全朝鲜委员会的问题上，罗宁也承认莫
  洛托夫的主张是“并非不能令人信服的”。他说：“甚至在双方各占一半的基础上组成这个委员会或许都是可以接受的。”然而，接着他又表示怀疑全朝鲜委员会是否会成为一个“过渡政府”，虽然在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国建议中明白规定了这个委员会的任务是筹备和组织选举。
    在撤退外国军队的问题上，罗宁不敢反对一切外国军队从朝鲜撤退的原则，但是他又以联合国军和中国人民志愿军不能同样处理为借口而拒绝达成原则协议。
    在中立国监察委员会的问题上，罗宁表示希望能组成一个“真正中立”的委员会，但他又说在未知道委员会的成员和职权以前不同意这一原则，虽然苏联建议中说明在原则确立后可进一步协商成员和职权问题。罗宁不敢说由联合国监督选举，但是他又说会议对成员问题的协议应为联合国所能接受的。
    对于由最关心远东和平的国家保证朝鲜的和平发展问题，罗宁也承认“这是一个肯定可予以考虑的问题”。然而，他又装作不了解这种保证是什么意思而把这个关系重大的问题撇开。
    罗宁表示愿意见到会议对于解决上述重要问题的原则达成协议，即使达成有限的协议也好。然而，他又认为目前还不能达成协议。罗宁最后说，他认为，与其按照苏联代表团的建议达成协议，不如向世界承认分歧的好。罗宁一方面提出一大堆问题表示希望得到答复，另一方面却又作出这种不负责任的说法，这只能说明他既不希望问题得到答复，也不愿意达成任何协议。
    新西兰代表麦辛托希接着发言。麦辛托希在他的发言中不能不同意应在朝鲜举行自由选举，这种选举应受到公正的监督，外国军队应该撤退，朝鲜的完整应该得到国际保证等等原则。然而，他接着又说，他不知道会议目前向世界宣布在这些原则上取得协议，会有什么好处。他以具体问题上的分歧来否认原则协议的必要，虽然大家知道原则的协议将有助于进一步协商解决具体问题上的分歧。
    会议休息十五分钟后，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日首先发言。（全文另发）
    英国代表艾登接着发言。艾登说他完全同意加拿大和新西兰代表的意见。艾登不敢完全反对莫洛托夫六月五日提出的五项建议，他只是用方法和程序问题上尚有分歧来拒绝就原则问题达成协议。
    艾登认为，在朝鲜问题的辩论中有两个基本问题。第一是所谓“联合国的权威”问题。艾登硬说联合国有权利继续干涉朝鲜的事务。然而大家知道，这是违反联合国宪章的。
    第二是全朝鲜自由选举的问题。艾登说他同意朝鲜应该统一，而且这种统一应该通过全国自由选举来实现，可是他又毫无理由地硬说这种选举只有在联合国的监督之下才会是自由的。艾登不同意先行撤退一切外国军队，据说这样就会引起“真空”。艾登的所谓“真空”，实际上就是害怕李承晚集团如果没有了美国的刺刀的支持，就会维持不了它的统治。艾登也反对按照朝鲜中立国监察委员会的经验组织监察选举的国际机构。他实际上是要反对人民民主国家参加监察。他表示如果达不到这个目的，在这个问题上就没有获得进展的希望。
    艾登最后说，他准备寻求达到协议的每一可能性，但必须有协议可能的迹象。如果在他提出的两
  个主要问题上的分歧不能得到解决的话，那么会议就只好承认它不能完成它的任务，他认为届时应把朝鲜问题交还给联合国。他认为应该保证现存的朝鲜停战在任何情况下继续有效，而政治解决则留待将来适当时机再谈。艾登的这些话只能说明，作为会议的主席之一，他并没有尽他应尽的职责，促使会议就已有的共同点达成协议，并就分歧问题继续协商，反而追随美国的政策，这个政策就是使日内瓦会议在朝鲜问题上毫无结果而散，并为联合国继续非法干涉朝鲜事务打开大门。
    泰国代表旺亲王和比利时代表斯巴克接着发言。泰国代表拒绝接受莫洛托夫的建议，说这不是具体方案。比利时代表不敢公开拒绝莫洛托夫的建议，却以仅仅原则上达成协议不能解决问题为理由，拒绝接受莫洛托夫的建议。但是莫洛托夫的建议本来就是要求在原则上达成协议，具体问题可以进一步讨论。
    法国代表皮杜尔接着发言。
    皮杜尔说，他有兴趣地倾听了和仔细地研究了苏联外长莫洛托夫六月五日的建议。他说他不同意苏联建议中关于成立全朝鲜委员会以筹备和进行全朝鲜自由选举一点。但是他又含糊地说法国代表团原则上同意朝鲜应作为一个自由、独立、民主的国家得到统一；应在全朝鲜举行选举，以便组成单一的、真正代表整个朝鲜的政府；选举应在真正自由并在国际监察的条件下进行；朝鲜问题的解决必须预先看到外国军队的撤退。皮杜尔没有提到国际保证朝鲜的和平发展，而主张一旦在正常情况下统一实现，联合国必须被邀来批准。
    皮杜尔发言完毕以后，主席宣布今日会议至此结束。下次会议举行日期将循正常程序通知。会议于七时二十分休会。
