    Who Is Obstructing the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Question
    U.S. Plays a Sabotage Trick
    During the Geneva Conference, the United States and the Syngman Rhee gang have been conspiring to interrupt the discussion on the Korean question. On June 2nd, Smith told American reporters in Geneva that the conference on the Korean question must be quickly interrupted because the United States was in an unfavorable position. On June 8th, Syngman Rhee told the Associated Press reporter in Seoul that the United States and South Korea should immediately withdraw from the Geneva Conference. He even said that "waiting for a full ninety days may be useless," and clamored for the use of "all weapons and attacking all appropriate targets," "If we (South Korea) must fight, then let us start as early as possible and demand that the free world end the meaningless diplomatic action of the Geneva Conference."
    Originally, the United States did not like the Geneva Conference. A Washington dispatch published in the Indian "Statesman" on June 4th revealed: "Senior American decision-makers from Dulles downwards have never liked the Geneva Conference, and they have written it off as an anticipated failure." Moreover, Reuters revealed before the opening of the Geneva Conference that Syngman Rhee's representatives went to Geneva "only to dramatically withdraw from the conference midway."
    However, things did not go as smoothly as the United States imagined. On June 5th, Foreign Minister Molotov's five-point proposal on the Korean question at the Geneva Conference, as well as the speeches by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Nan Il, dealt a serious blow to the conspiracy of the United States and Syngman Rhee's representatives to interrupt the discussion on the Korean question, making the long-delayed discussion on the Korean question show the possibility of a peaceful resolution. Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal made a very strong impression. The British "Times" said that "it is impossible to raise any objections" to this proposal, and the "Manchester Guardian" also said that it is "more difficult" to further obstruct the discussion of a solution.
    Interrupting the meeting is not only difficult but also risky, because the people demand that the Korean question must be resolved.
    Smith's "Painful Experience"
    In the discussion on the Korean question, our delegation proposed that the Korean elections should be supervised by a neutral nations supervisory commission, the composition of which should be the same as the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. However, the US representative opposed supervision by the neutral nations supervisory commission. At the Geneva Conference on June 5th, Smith insisted: "This international organization can absolutely not do anything." He also tried his best to deny the positive role played by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in assisting the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. He said: "The painful experience that such an institution has given us in the Korean armistice has taught us a lesson, and this lesson is still fresh in our minds."
    What kind of "painful experience" made the American representative "fresh in his memory"? It is nothing more than things like this:
    On September 4th last year, the Neutral Nations Inspection Team stationed at the port of Busan discovered a batch of boxes at Busan's Pier No. 2. At that time, Major Jabłoński, the Polish member of the inspection team, asked Lieutenant Riley, the U.S. officer on duty, what was in these boxes. Lieutenant Riley replied that it was just some items from the military commissary such as canned goods and did not contain any weapons. After carefully observing these boxes and their markings, the inspection team decided to conduct further investigation. At the request of the team, one of the boxes was opened, and it turned out that the box did not contain canned goods or anything like that, but a complete mortar barrel, with a caliber of 4.2 inches and a number of 7144252. Later, the team asked to open one of each different type of box and found that they contained mortar carriages and complete mortar sights respectively. These were all the disassembled parts of a mortar. Assembling all the disassembled parts in all the boxes would make one hundred and six complete, brand-new mortars!
    From this we can see that it was precisely because the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission fulfilled its responsibilities and exposed the US violations of the armistice agreement that the US representative felt "pain." Now they are afraid that if a fair international organization is allowed to supervise the Korean elections and expose the US plot to undermine the agreement, the same "pain" will still occur. That is why Smith strongly opposes the Korean elections being supervised by a neutral nations supervisory commission.
    Laughable "United Nations" Supervision
    While strongly rejecting supervision of the Korean elections by a neutral nations supervisory commission, the US representative strongly advocated supervision of the Korean elections by the "United Nations". Even after Foreign Minister Molotov put forward the five-point proposal on June 5th, Smith still clamored that the United States was fully prepared to "place the issue of UN supervision of Korean elections "before world opinion."
    Smith's clamor not only demonstrated the United States' arrogance and stubbornness, but also demonstrated the United States' stupidity and ridiculousness. Because the three words "United Nations" are synonymous with "interference" and "aggression" for Korea, and the history of the relationship between the "United Nations" and Korea is a history of interference and aggression against Korea. At the meeting on May 28th to discuss the Korean question, Smith talked at length about the "moral strength" of the "United Nations" and said that the American invasion of Korea was to "defend this ideal: the United Nations flag is not a piece of cloth." In fact, it is not others but the United States itself that regards the United Nations flag as a piece of cloth! As early as 1948, the United States used this piece of cloth ("United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea") to cover up the so-called "elections" in South Korea, putting the puppet Syngman Rhee on the seat of "President". Later, in 1950, the United States again used this piece of cloth ("United Nations Forces") to cover up its aggression against Korea. In this way, the "United Nations" became a belligerent party in the Korean War. At the same time, the Wall Street bosses also believed that this practice "was not a bad deal." The US Permanent Representative to the United Nations Lodge said:
  "To estimate the value of the United Nations in terms of pure financial expenditure", because in addition to the United States, fifteen United Nations member states sent about two divisions of troops to Korea, and the United States "saved 600 million US dollars a year" in the Korean War! In this way, the United Nations flag, this piece of cloth, has again been seen by the Wall Street bosses as a good thing to be sewn into a money bag.
    It is very obvious that the United States is still attempting to use such a rag to cover up its conspiracy to undermine the Korean elections, which is so stupid and ridiculous! What's more, the "United Nations" is a belligerent party, and it has long lost the qualification and moral strength to deal with the Korean question fairly.
    The British "Times" of June 7th also admitted: Although the United States "has asked many delegations to advocate that any elections in Korea must be supervised by the United Nations, it is clear that some Western delegations do not insist on the United Nations supervising the elections if effective neutral nations supervision can be guaranteed."
    Smith clamors to "place the issue" of supervision of Korean elections by the "United Nations" "before world opinion," but first he should listen to world opinion!

    谁在阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题
    美国进行破坏的把戏
    在日内瓦会议期间，美国和李承晚匪帮一直阴谋中断关于朝鲜问题的讨论。六月二日，史密斯在日内瓦对美国记者们说，由于美国处境不利，关于朝鲜问题的会议必须迅速中断。六月八日，李承晚在汉城对美联社记者表示，美国和南朝鲜应该立即退出日内瓦会议，他竟说“要等满九十天可能是没有用处的”，并且叫嚷使用“一切武器和进攻一切适当的目标”，“如果我们（南朝鲜）一定要作战的话，那么就让我们尽早地开始并且要求自由世界结束日内瓦会议那种毫无意义的外交行动吧。”
    本来，美国就是不喜欢开日内瓦会议的。六月四日印度“政治家报”刊载的一条华盛顿电讯透露：“自杜勒斯以下的美国高级决策人员从来没有喜欢过日内瓦会议，他们把它当作预料中的失败一样把它一笔勾销”。而且路透社在日内瓦会议开幕之前就透露说，李承晚的代表到日内瓦去，“只是为了戏剧性地中途退出会议”而已。
    然而，事情并没有像美国想像的那样美妙，六月五日日内瓦会议上莫洛托夫外长关于朝鲜问题的五点建议以及周恩来外长和南日外务相的发言，对美国和李承晚代表中断朝鲜问题的讨论的阴谋，给予了一个严重的打击，使拖延很久的朝鲜问题的讨论又呈现了和平解决的可能性。莫洛托夫外长的建议给人一种非常强烈的印象，英国“泰晤士报”说，对这个建议“不可能提出什么反对的意见”，“曼彻斯特卫报”也说：想进一步阻挠讨论一个解决的办法是“更加困难了”。
    中断会议不仅是困难的，而且是冒险的，因为人民要求朝鲜问题必须解决。
    史密斯的“痛苦经验”
    在朝鲜问题的讨论中，我国代表团建议应由一个中立国委员会来对朝鲜选举进行监督，它的组成和朝鲜中立国监察委员会相同。然而美国代表却反对由中立国委员会来监督。在六月五日的日内瓦会议上，史密斯一口咬定说：“这个国际机构是绝对不能作出任何事情的。”他并且极力否认中立国监察委员会对于协助朝鲜停战协定的实施所起的积极作用，他说：“在朝鲜停战中这样一种机构所给予我们的痛苦经验，已使我们得到了教训，这种教训对我们来说是记忆犹新的。”
    是什么样的“痛苦经验”使美国代表“记忆犹新”呢？不外是这一类事情吧：
    去年九月四日，驻釜山口岸的中立国视察小组在釜山第二码头发现了一批箱子。当时视察小组的波兰组员雅布罗斯基少校就问美方值班军官赖里中尉这些箱子装的什么，赖里中尉回答说这不过是装的一些军中贩卖部的物品如罐头物品之类，并没有装任何武器。视察小组在敏锐地观察了这些箱子和它的标志以后，决定进行进一步的调查。在小组的要求下，这批箱子中的一个被打开了，原来箱子里装的并不是什么罐头之类，而是一个完整的迫击炮炮筒，口径四点二吋，号码是七一四四二五二。以后小组又要求把每一个不同种类的箱子各打开一个，发现里面分别装着迫击炮炮架和迫击炮全副瞄准具，这些就是一门迫击炮的全部拆散开来的东西。把所有的箱子里的拆散开的东西都装配起来，就成为一百零六门完整的、崭新的迫击炮！
    从这里我们可以看出：正是中立国监察委员会尽了自己的职责，揭露了美方违反停战协定的事件，才使美国代表感到了“痛苦”。如今他们害怕如果让一个公正的国际机构去监督朝鲜选举，揭露美方预谋的破坏协议的勾当，同样的“痛苦”仍会产生。这就是为什么史密斯极力反对由一个中立国委员会监督朝鲜选举的原因。
    可笑的“联合国”监督
    美国代表在极力拒绝由一个中立国委员会监督朝鲜选举的同时，极力主张由“联合国”来监督朝鲜选举，甚至在六月五日莫洛托夫外长提出五点建议之后，史密斯仍然叫嚷说，美国已完全准备好了要把由“联合国”监督朝鲜选举的问题“置于世界舆论面前”。
    史密斯的叫嚷不仅表现了美国的蛮横固执，而且表现了美国的愚蠢可笑。因为“联合国”这三个字，对于朝鲜来说就是“干涉”和“侵略”的代名词，“联合国”和朝鲜的关系史就是一部干涉和侵略朝鲜的历史。在五月二十八日讨论朝鲜问题的会议上，史密斯大谈“联合国”的“道义力量”，并且说美国侵略朝鲜是为“保卫这种理想：联合国旗帜不是一块布”。其实，把联合国旗帜当作一块布的不是别人，正是美国自己！远在一九四八年，美国就拿这块布（“联合国朝鲜临时委员会”）来遮盖南朝鲜的所谓“选举”，把傀儡李承晚扶上了
  “总统”的座位。后来在一九五○年，美国又拿这块布（“联合国军”）来遮盖它对朝鲜的侵略。这样，“联合国”就成为朝鲜战争中的交战的一方了。同时，华尔街老板们还认为这种做法“不是一宗坏的交易”，美国常驻联合国代表洛奇说过：
  “用纯粹财政经费来估计联合国的价值”，因为除美国以外，十五个联合国会员国派了约两师军队到朝鲜去，美国在朝鲜战争中“每年就节省了六亿美元！”这样看来，联合国旗帜这块布，又被华尔街老板们看成为缝成钱袋的好东西了。
    很显然，美国仍然企图用这样的破布来遮盖破坏朝鲜选举的阴谋，那是多么愚蠢可笑！何况“联合国”是交战的一方，它早已失去了公平处理朝鲜问题的资格和道德力量了。
    六月七日的英国“泰晤士报”也承认：虽然美国“已要求许多代表团主张朝鲜的任何选举必须由联合国监督，但是人们清楚地看到：某些西方代表团并不坚持要由联合国监督选举，如果能够保证进行有效的中立国监督的话。”
    史密斯叫嚷着要把由“联合国”监督朝鲜选举的问题“置于世界舆论面前”，可是，他首先应该听听世界舆论！
