Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 10th: The People’s Republic of China delegation and the United States delegation held their second contact on the morning of the 10th regarding the issue of nationals and students of both sides in each other's countries.

    The American representative, Johnson, submitted a list of American nationals and American military personnel whom he believed were being detained by the Chinese government, requesting that the Chinese side give these people the opportunity to return home as soon as possible.

    The Chinese representative, Wang Bingnan, replied as follows:

    Today's contact regarding the issue of nationals and students of both sides in each other's countries will not be difficult to achieve a reasonable and fair solution, as long as both sides have the sincerity to solve the problem.

    The Chinese government has always protected American nationals in China as long as they abide by Chinese laws. They can reside in China and engage in legitimate occupations. If they want to leave China and return home for some reason, they can leave at any time as long as they have no outstanding criminal or civil cases. In fact, since the founding of the People's Republic of China, 1,485 American nationals have left China: 582 in 1950, 727 in 1951, 143 in 1952, and 33 in 1953. The Chinese government has never made things difficult for them because they are American citizens. The Chinese government and people have always been friendly to the American people.

    A very small number of Americans have engaged in espionage and sabotage activities in China, some have joined the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique to carry out the civil war against the Chinese people, and some have violated China's airspace or intruded into China's territorial waters. The Chinese People's Government handles these few lawbreakers according to law, which is the duty of a sovereign state. The Chinese government is completely sentencing them according to the crimes they have committed, and their detention is well-deserved. We will study the list of Americans you submitted and reply to you at the next contact.

    Regarding the issue of Chinese students detained by the US government, we plan to raise it at the next contact.

    The next contact is scheduled for June 15.

    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 15th: The People's Republic of China delegation and the United States delegation held their third contact on the issue of students and nationals of both sides in each other's countries at 10:00 a.m. on the 15th.

    The Chinese representative, Wang Bingnan, first replied to the questions raised by the other party on June 10th. Wang Bingnan said: The Chinese side agrees that American nationals detained for crimes and American military personnel detained for violating Chinese airspace may communicate with their families, and their families may also send small packages to them. The transfer of the above letters and small packages shall be handled by the headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross Society in Beijing.

    Wang Bingnan also said: The Chinese government sentences foreign criminals (including American criminals and American military personnel who violate Chinese airspace) according to the crimes they have committed. However, after sentencing, if the criminal's behavior is good, the Chinese government may consider commutation or early release. The Chinese government has done this before.

    Regarding the list submitted by the US side on June 10th, Wang Bingnan said that the relevant departments of the Chinese government are verifying it. Once the Chinese delegation receives the materials, it will schedule a meeting with the US side.

    Wang Bingnan then raised the issue of the US government's unreasonable detention of Chinese students. Wang Bingnan pointed out: There are currently more than 5,000 Chinese students in the United States, and many students want to leave the United States and return to their motherland, but they have been subjected to all kinds of difficulties. When they applied to the US government for exit visas, the US government notified them that they were not allowed to leave the United States, and told them that if they violated this order, they would be fined no more than 5,000 US dollars or sentenced to no more than five years in prison, or both. The US government even confiscated the passports of Chinese students in the United States. The US government not only detains Chinese students, but also abuses, arrests, and imprisons students who have requested to return to their country, which makes many Chinese students afraid to request to return home. The US delegation also admitted the fact that the US government detained Chinese students in its statement on May 29th.

    Wang Bingnan pointed out: Chinese students in the United States have not committed any crimes, but the US government deprives them of their right to return to their motherland and deprives them of their right to reunite with their families, which is unreasonable. Therefore, it is requested that the US government stop detaining Chinese students and restore their right to leave the United States and return to China at any time. As for Chinese nationals residing in the United States, they should also enjoy the right to return to their motherland at any time.

    Finally, Wang Bingnan suggested that the two sides issue a joint communiqué stating that both governments will not hinder law-abiding nationals and students of the other side within their own borders when they apply to return to their country, and that they have the freedom to return home at any time.

### 就两国的留学生和侨民问题  我国代表团和美国代表团接触

    就两国的留学生和侨民问题
    我国代表团和美国代表团接触
    【新华社日内瓦十日电】中华人民共和国代表团方面与美国代表团方面十日上午就双方在对方境内的侨民和留学生问题进行第二次接触。
    美国代表约翰逊提交了他认为被中国政府拘留的美国侨民与美国军人的名单，要求中国方面给予这些人以早日回国的机会。
    中国代表王炳南对此答复如下：
    今天关于双方在对方的侨民和留学生问题的接触，只要双方都有解决问题的诚意，是不难取得合理的公平的解决的。
    我国政府对于在中国的美国侨民，只要他们遵守中国法律，是一贯给予保护的。他们可以在中国境内居留，从事合法的职业。如果他们为着某种原因要离开中国返国，只要他们没有什么未了的刑事或民事案件，他们随时都可以走。事实上，自中华人民共和国成立以来，已经有一千四百八十五名美国侨民离开了中国，一九五零年五百八十二人，一九五一年七百二十七人，一九五二年一百四十三人，一九五三年三十三人。中国政府从来没有过因为他们是美国的公民而加以留难。中国政府和人民始终是对美国人民友好的。
    有极少数的美国人在中国从事间谍活动和破坏活动，有的参加蒋介石反动集团进行反中国人民的内战，还有的侵犯了中国的领空或闯进中国领海内，中国人民政府对这些少数犯法的人依法处办，这是主权国家的政府应尽的职责。中国政府完全是按照他们已犯的罪来量刑，他们的被扣禁是罪有应得。你方交来的美国人的名单，我们将进行研究并将于下一次接触中答复你们。
    关于被美国政府扣留的中国留学生的问题，我们准备在下次接触中提出。
    下次接触定在六月十五日进行。
    【新华社日内瓦十五日电】中华人民共和国代表团方面和美国代表团方面十五日上午十时就双方在对方境内的留学生及侨民问题进行了第三次接触。
    中国代表王炳南首先答复了对方六月十日提出的问题。王炳南说：中国方面同意：因犯罪而被拘禁的美国侨民以及因侵犯中国领空而被拘禁的美国军事人员，得与他们的家属通讯，他们的家属也可寄小包裹给他们。上项来往信件和小包裹的转递，均经北京中国红十字会总会办理。
    王炳南又说：中国政府对于犯法外侨（包括犯法的美侨和侵犯中国领空的美国军事人员在内）是按照他们所犯的罪来量刑的。但在判刑之后，如该犯的行为表现良好，则中国政府可考虑减刑或提前释放。中国政府曾经这样做过了的。
    关于美方六月十日交来的名单，王炳南说，中国政府有关部门正在核查中，一俟中国代表团方面收到材料，当与美方约期会谈。
    王炳南接着向美方提出美国政府无理扣留我国留学生的问题。王炳南指出：中国现有五千多留学生在美国，有不少留学生要离美返回祖国，可是受到了百般留难。当他们向美国政府要离境签证时，美国政府通知他们不得离开美国，并向他们说，如果他们违反这一命令，将被判处五千美元以下的罚金或者五年以下的徒刑，或者同时予以两种处分。美国政府甚至把中国留美学生的护照都收去。美国政府不仅有扣留中国留学生的事情，而且有虐待、逮捕、监禁已要求返回祖国的学生的事情，因而使许多中国留学生不敢要求回国。美国代表团在五月二十九日的声明中，也已承认美国政府扣留中国学生的事实。
    王炳南指出：中国留美学生并没有犯罪，美国政府却剥夺他们返回祖国的权利，剥夺他们同家人团聚的权利，这是不合理的。因此，要求美国政府停止扣留中国学生，并恢复他们随时离开美国返回中国的权利。至于居留于美国的中国侨民，也同样应享有随时返回祖国的权利。
    最后王炳南建议双方发表一个共同公报，表示双方政府对于在本方境内的对方守法侨民和留学生在申请回国时均不加阻难，他们有随时返国的自由。
