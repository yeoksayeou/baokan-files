In Yuxian County, Hebei Province, hills and mountains account for nearly half of the county's total area, and springs and streams are scarce. More than sixty villages have particular difficulty obtaining drinking water for people and livestock. During the spring, autumn, and winter seasons, people generally have to fetch water from more than five *li* away, and in the worst cases, they have to carry water from more than ten *li* away. This year, under the leadership of the People's Government, farmers are building nine drinking water projects with public assistance. Most of the projects are already halfway completed, and six of them can be completed by the end of June. After all the projects are completed this year, they will solve the water needs of more than 1,800 households in twelve villages, saving more than 27,000 workdays for people and livestock throughout the year.

    河北省蔚县修建饮水工程
    河北省蔚县境内的丘陵和山地几占全县总面积的一半，泉溪很少。有六十多个村庄人畜吃水特别困难，在春、秋、冬三季，一般要到五里以外取吃水，最多的要去十里以外去驮水。今年，人民政府领导农民以民办公助的方式，修建饮水工程九处，目前大部工程已经完成一半，有六处工程在六月底可以完工。今年工程全部完成后，可以解决十二个村一千八百多户的人畜用水，全年可以节省人、畜工各二万七千多个。
