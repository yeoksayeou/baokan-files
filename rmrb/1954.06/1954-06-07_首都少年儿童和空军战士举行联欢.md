Capital Children and Air Force Soldiers Hold Joint Celebration

    On June 6th, hundreds of children and People's Air Force soldiers held a joint celebration at an airport in the suburbs of the capital.

    In the morning, the Air Force uncles took the children to visit the airport and aircraft equipment, carefully explaining the use of each piece of equipment to them. Those tall hangars, the weather station predicting climate change, the various complex machines and instruments on the aircraft...all these novel things aroused great interest in the children. The Air Force uncles and aunts told the children many stories of flying, telling them that to be an excellent pilot, they must strive to follow Chairman Mao's instructions of "good health, good study, and good work" from childhood, and strive to be a good Young Pioneer. The children were very moved after listening. A child from the Affiliated Girls' Middle School of Beijing Normal University took an Air Force aunt's hand and said, "Auntie, I will definitely listen to you and learn from you."

    After lunch, the children excitedly boarded a giant transport plane, and the Air Force uncles took them on a pleasant flight over the capital.

    The children played until 5:00 in the afternoon before leaving the airport. When they left, they gave their carefully crafted model airplanes and bright red scarves to the Air Force uncles and aunts, saying that today they had a deeper understanding of the meaning of "always be prepared!"

    首都少年儿童和空军战士举行联欢
    六月六日这一天，首都郊区某机场上，有数百个少年儿童和人民空军的战士们举行了联欢。
    上午，空军叔叔带着孩子们参观了机场和飞机的设备，仔细地给他们讲解每个设备的用处。那些高大的机库、预测气候变化的气象台、飞机上的各种复杂的机器、仪表……，这一切新奇的东西都引起了孩子们莫大的兴趣。空军叔叔和阿姨们给孩子们讲很多飞行的故事。告诉他们要想做一个优秀的飞行员，从小时候就要努力做到毛主席“身体好、学习好、工作好”的指示，争取当一名好队员。孩子们听了都非常感动。一个北京师范大学附属女子中学的孩子拉着空军阿姨的手说：“阿姨，我一定听您的话，并且向您学习。”
    午饭后，孩子们兴奋地登上一架巨型运输机，空军叔叔带着他们在首都上空作了一次愉快的飞行。
    孩子们一直玩到下午五点钟，才离开机场。临走的时候，他们把自己精心制造的模型飞机送给了空军叔叔和阿姨们，把那鲜艳的红领巾也献给了空军叔叔和阿姨们，他们说：今天他们更加体会到“时刻准备着！”的意义了。（甸义）（附图片）
