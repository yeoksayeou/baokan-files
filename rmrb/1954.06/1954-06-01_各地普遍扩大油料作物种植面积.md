Across various regions, there is a general emphasis on oil crop production, with active efforts to expand planting areas and increase yields per unit area. This year, the national rapeseed planting area has expanded by 850,000 mu compared to 1953, and the total rapeseed yield is expected to exceed last year's level. The total output in the Southwest region is estimated to increase by more than 10% compared to last year, and the output in East China is expected to be slightly higher than last year. In the Northwest region, the growth in southern Shaanxi is good. The Guanzhong area is about the same as last year, with an estimated average yield of 60 to 70 jin. Only the Central South region has been affected by excessive rainfall last winter and this spring, which has impacted the harvest to some extent. The peanut planting area is estimated to expand by about 4 million mu nationwide compared to 1953. Many places have been paying attention to improving peanut production techniques. In Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Shaanxi and other provinces, over 2.5 million mu have been sown with peanut rhizobia, five times more than last year. In addition, some places in Fujian, Jiangsu, and Shandong have opened training courses to impart advanced peanut cultivation techniques. This year, various regions have also universally emphasized the use of edges of fields and all available vacant land to plant sunflowers. Jiangsu Province requires each farmer to ensure the planting of 50 sunflower plants. Shanxi Province allocated more than 30,000 jin of seeds free of charge to farmers for planting. Other provinces and autonomous regions such as Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Jilin, Shaanxi, Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Sichuan have also actively mobilized the masses to plant more sunflowers, with some putting forward slogans such as "every household plants, every family plants." Many local organs, organizations, and schools have also responded to the call and carried out sunflower planting activities, such as in Chengdu, Nanjing, and Hefei, which have mobilized all staff to plant in the vacant land of various government offices. Sesame is still being sown, and the planting area is estimated to maintain last year's level. In addition, the planting areas for oil tea, flax, castor and other crops have also been appropriately expanded in various regions.

    各地普遍扩大油料作物种植面积
    今年各地重视油料作物的生产，都积极设法扩大播种面积和提高单位面积产量。今年全国油菜种植面积，比一九五三年扩大八十五万亩，油菜总产量可超过去年水平。西南全区产量估计可比去年增加一成以上，华东区产量可稍高于去年，西北区在陕西的陕南生长较好，关中一带和去年不相上下，估计平均产量可达六、七十斤。只中南区因去冬今春雨水较多，收成受到一定影响。花生种植面积，估计全国可较一九五三年扩大四百万亩左右。许多地方都注意改进花生的生产技术，山东、河南、江苏、陕西等省用花生根瘤菌拌种的有二百五十余万亩，超过去年五倍。另外，福建、江苏、山东有些地方，都开了训练班，传授花生先进栽培技术。今年各地还普遍重视利用地头及一切空闲土地种植向日葵，江苏省要求每一农户保证种植五十株向日葵，山西调拨了三万多斤种子无代价发给农民种植，其他如内蒙古自治区及黑龙江、热河、吉林、陕西、河北、河南、安徽、浙江、四川等省也都积极发动群众多种向日葵，有的提出了“家家种、户户种”的口号；许多地方的机关、团体和学校，也都响应号召，开展了种植向日葵的活动，如成都市、南京市、合肥市都动员全市工作人员在各机关空地种植。芝麻现在正在继续播种中，估计播植面积可维持去年水平。此外，各地对油茶、葫麻、蓖麻等作物的播种面积也都适当扩大。
