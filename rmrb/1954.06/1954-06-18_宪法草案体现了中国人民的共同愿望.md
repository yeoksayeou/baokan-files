    The Draft Constitution Embodies the Common Aspirations of the Chinese People
    Qian Weichang, Provost of Tsinghua University

    The Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China embodies the common aspirations of the Chinese people. It not only uses clauses to solidify the political and economic victories of our people since the founding of the nation, but also guarantees that our country can eliminate exploitation and poverty and establish the socialist society that people yearn for through peaceful means.

    This draft constitution did not come easily; it is the result of the heroic struggles of countless revolutionary martyrs and millions upon millions of working people. It is because of their sacrifices and struggles that we have obtained the various rights conferred by the draft constitution.

    The draft constitution is like a solemn and beautiful epic, every word and every sentence of which attracts our hearts. As a citizen of the People's Republic of China, I feel very proud and very honored.

    The draft constitution grants citizens the right to engage in scientific research and encourages and assists labor creation in science and technology. As a scientific worker, I will cherish this right. Undoubtedly, only in a people's democratic country led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance can scientific researchers obtain rights guaranteed by the state. We wish science a rapid development in the socialist industrial construction of the motherland.

    As an educator, I will be satisfied to cherish all the rights conferred by the draft constitution. We will do everything we can to improve our teaching quality and cultivate talents for the country.

    The draft constitution depicts the greatness and loveliness of our motherland, and at the same time points out a bright and splendid prospect for us, let us use our labor to create a happy future!

    宪法草案体现了中国人民的共同愿望
    清华大学教务长　钱伟长
    中华人民共和国宪法草案，体现了中国人民的共同愿望。它不仅用条文把我国人民建国以来政治上、经济上的胜利固定下来，并且保证了我国能够通过和平的道路，消灭剥削，消灭贫困，建立人们向往的社会主义社会。
    这个宪法草案，来之不易，它是无数革命先烈和千千万万劳动人民英勇斗争的果实。由于他们的牺牲和斗争，我们才获得了宪法草案所赋予的各种权利。
    宪法草案像一部庄严而美丽的史诗，它的每一个字每一句话都吸引着我们的心。作为中华人民共和国的一个公民，我觉得很骄傲，觉得很光荣。
    宪法草案赋予公民以从事科学研究的权利，对于科学技术的劳动创造给以鼓励和帮助。作为一个科学工作者，我将珍视这个权利。无疑的，只有在一个以工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家里，科学研究工作者才会得到受国家保障的权利。我们预祝科学在祖国社会主义工业建设中获得快速的发展。
    作为一个教育工作者，我将满意地珍视宪法草案赋予的一切权利。我们将尽一切力量提高我们的教学质量，为国家培养人才。
    宪法草案给我们刻划出了祖国的伟大和可爱，同时也给我们指出了光明灿烂的远景，让我们用自己的劳动来创造幸福前途！
