Review of "A Concise History of the United States"
Xie Lianzao
Written by Huang Shaoxiang, published by Sanlian Bookstore

From the Marxist-Leninist scientific viewpoint, social history is the history of the masses of the people, that is, the history of the producers of social material wealth who constantly promote social progress. "A Concise History of the United States" is a general history of the United States written by Huang Shaoxiang based on this viewpoint. The author points out in the preface that the purpose and task of studying American history is to explain how American capitalism developed and declined, to expose American aggression against colonies and semi-colonies, to elaborate on the historical development of the American people's struggle, and finally to point out that the American working people will surely win the final victory. The author basically completed this task in this book.

"A Concise History of the United States" narrates the history of the United States from the colonial period of North America in the 17th century to the failure of the American invasion of Korea and the election of Eisenhower as President of the United States in 1952. The book consists of ten chapters. Chapter 1 describes the development of the North American colonial system and the British plunder of the colonies during the period of primitive accumulation of capitalism; Chapter 2 describes the American bourgeois revolution of 1776; Chapters 3 and 4 describe the development of American capitalism and its characteristics from the victory of the American Revolution to the first half of the 19th century; Chapters 5 and 6 describe the Civil War caused by the struggle between two kinds of relations of production, that is, two kinds of social systems, and the rapid development of American capitalism after the Civil War; Chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10 describe the new stage of the emergence, expansion, and aggression of American imperialism, its dying struggle and the launching of the war of aggression against Korea, its inevitable demise, and the American working people's inevitable victory.

In "A Concise History of the United States," Huang Shaoxiang uses the development of American capitalism and the unfolding of class struggle as the main thread running through the book, and briefly narrates the history of the American people's great struggle to get rid of the shackles of capitalism. Each chapter of this book not only introduces to the readers the living conditions and status of the American working people, but also explains that the masses of the people are the main force in promoting historical development. The book points out that the numerous peasant uprisings before the War of Independence, coupled with the anti-British struggles of the urban civilians in the colonies, fatally struck the British colonial system in North America, thus ensuring the victory of the American bourgeois revolution. The book also notes the peasant movements after the victory of the American bourgeois revolution, such as Shays' Rebellion, which broke out in Massachusetts in 1786 (pages 60-62 of the original book), and the Whiskey Rebellion of farmers on the western frontier of Pennsylvania in 1794 (page 74 of the original book), etc. The author not only explains the reasons for the failure of these movements, but also explains their achievements, which helped the Jeffersonian bourgeois democrats to achieve victory in the struggle against the reactionary Hamilton (Chapter 3 of the original book). Regarding the various movements of the people to fight for their rights during the period of capitalist development, such as the strikes of workers in major American cities to reduce working hours from 1825 to 1837 and from 1850 to 1862, the black uprising led by John Brown in 1859, and the participation of northern workers in the army during the Civil War, there are sufficient narratives in this book. The book also provides a brief analysis of the labor and peasant movements during the period of rapid development of American capitalism and the period of imperialism, such as the Farmers' Alliance from 1870 to 1876, the "May 1st" movement in 1886, and the Knights of Labor from 1886 to 1890. The author made a relatively concrete narrative and analysis of the American Communist Party, which was established in 1919 after the great Russian October Socialist Revolution, and its activities, and the American people's movement for lasting peace and people's democracy, which was launched in 1949, which is even more helpful for us to understand and understand the American people's opposition to fascism and the war movement.

Another feature of "A Concise History of the United States" is that the author has made new evaluations of famous figures in American history. The author has made new evaluations of the bourgeois leaders during the period of American capitalist development, such as Washington, Jefferson, Paine, Douglass, and Lincoln, affirming their position and role in the bourgeois revolution, while also pointing out the limitations of their class and making appropriate criticisms of them. The author has also made appropriate narratives of the activities of outstanding people's leaders in American history, such as Joseph Weydemeyer, Meyer, Siweis, Zorge, Bahrson, Stewart, Debs, Ruthenberg, and Foster.

Another feature of this book is that, based on the works of William Z. Foster, chairman of the American Communist Party, and the works of American historical science workers such as Foner, Allen, Morris, Rochester, and Aptheker, the author introduces the research results of the American new historical circles on the one hand, and criticizes the American bourgeois historiographers' consistent distortion and fabrication of American history and refutes the reactionary historical theory of "American exceptionalism" that serves the financial oligarchs on the other hand. At the same time, many important issues in American political history, such as the nature of American political parties, the bourgeois democratic movements of Jefferson, Jackson, and Stevens, the Civil War and Reconstruction era, the Populist movement at the end of the 19th century, the American policy of national oppression, the policy of discrimination against blacks and the policy of excluding Chinese, Wilson's "liberalism," and Roosevelt's "New Deal," have been analyzed in more specific terms.

Generally speaking, this book pays attention to analyzing the relationship between the base and the superstructure in American social development. For example, in Chapter 5, the author explains the economic base of American society during the American Civil War and the changes that took place in the South and the North in the process of its development, the impact of the base on American politics, and the final outbreak of the civil war. However, the author did not narrate the part about ideology, that is, the aspects of philosophy, natural science, literature, and art in American history, which is a defect of this book.

However, the part of the book describing the relationship between the United States and China seems to be too brief. If the author could combine the history of the United States with the history of Sino-US relations, and analyze the outward expansion promoted by the American ruling group in order to get rid of the economic crisis in each period of American history, especially the intensified aggression against China in recent decades, then readers will not only be able to understand the trend of American historical development after reading this book, but also have a deeper understanding of the nature and sinister face of American imperialism. In addition, the author's view that the United States did not participate in the Anglo-French Allied Forces' campaign in 1857 (page 139 of the original book) is also inconsistent with the facts.

Finally, it should be pointed out that "A Concise History of the United States" is written by the author based on his years of practical work, teaching, and research experience. It is the first book on foreign general history written from a new perspective by the Chinese historical circles since liberation. The author's attitude to writing is serious and realistic. Although there are still shortcomings in the book, the value of this book is not diminished because of this, and it also shows that it is an arduous task to compile foreign history using historical materialism. It is hoped that the cultural and publishing circles will advocate compiling more good books with this serious and realistic attitude to meet the needs of the people across the country in cultural life.

    评介“美国简明史”
    谢琏造
    黄绍湘著　三联书店出版
    从马克思列宁主义科学的观点看来，社会历史就是人民群众的历史，也就是经常推动社会前进的社会物质财富生产者本身的历史。“美国简明史”便是黄绍湘根据这个观点写成的美国通史。作者在自序里指出，研究美国史的目的和任务是要说明美国资本主义是怎样发展和没落的，揭露美国对殖民地和半殖民地的侵略，阐发美国人民斗争的历史发展，最后指明美国劳动人民必将获得最后的胜利。作者在这本书里基本上完成了这一任务。
    “美国简明史”叙述了自从十七世纪北美洲殖民地时期到一九五二年美国侵朝战争失败和艾森豪威尔当选为美国总统为止时期的美国历史。全书共计十章。第一章叙述资本主义原始积累时期北美殖民地制度的发展和英国对殖民地的掠夺；第二章叙述一七七六年的美国资产阶级革命；第三、四章叙述美国革命胜利以后到十九世纪上半期美国资本主义的发展和它的特点；第五、六章叙述由于两种生产关系，亦即两种社会制度的斗争而引起的南北战争和南北战争以后美国资本主义急速的发展；第七、八、九、十章叙述美国帝国主义的出现、扩张、侵略的新阶段，垂死的挣扎与发动侵朝战争，及其必然走向灭亡和美国劳动人民必然获得最后的胜利。
    黄绍湘在“美国简明史”里，以美国资本主义的发展和阶级斗争的展开作为贯串全书的线索，扼要地叙述了美国人民为摆脱资本主义的枷锁而进行的巨大的斗争的历史。本书的各章不仅向读者介绍了美国劳动人民的生活情况和地位，并且也说明了人民群众是推动历史发展的主力。本书指出，独立革命以前的多次农民起义配合着殖民地的城市平民的反英斗争，曾致命地打击了英国在北美洲的殖民制度，从而保证了美国资产阶级革命的胜利。本书也注意到美国资产阶级革命胜利以后的农民运动，例如一七八六年在麻萨诸塞州境内爆发的薛司农民起义（原书第六○至六二页），一七九四年宾夕法尼亚州西部边疆农民的威士忌酒事件农民起义（原书第七四页）等等。作者不仅说明了这些运动失败的原因，并且也说明了它们的成就，它们助成杰斐逊派资产阶级民主主义在反对反动的韩密尔顿的斗争中取得了胜利（原书第三章）。关于资本主义发展时期的人民争取自己权利的各种运动，例如一八二五年至一八三七年和一八五○年至一八六二年在美国各大城市的工人为减少工时而进行的罢工斗争，一八五九年约翰·布朗所领导的黑人起义，南北战争中北部工人的参军运动等等，本书中都有足够的叙述。美国资本主义急剧发展的时期和帝国主义时期的工农运动，例如一八七○年至一八七六年的农民协进会，一八八六年的“五·一”运动，一八八六年至一八九○年的劳动骑士团等等，本书也作了扼要的分析。关于伟大的俄国十月社会主义革命以后一九一九年成立的美国共产党及其活动，和一九四九年开展的美国人民为争取持久和平、争取人民民主运动，作者在书中做了比较具体的叙述和分析，更足以帮助我们来认识和了解美国人民反对法西斯化、反对战争运动的情况。
    “美国简明史”的另一个特点，是作者对于美国史上的著名人物，都作了新的评价。对于美国资本主义发展时期的资产阶级领袖人物，如华盛顿、杰斐逊、斐因、陶格拉斯和林肯等等，作者都作了新的估价，肯定了他们在资产阶级革命中的地位和作用，同时也指出了他们所处的阶级的局限性，对他们作了适当的批判。对于美国史上的优秀的人民领袖，如约瑟夫·魏德迈尔、梅耶尔、席威思、佐尔格、巴尔逊、司蒂华德、德布斯、鲁腾堡和福斯特等等的活动，作者也都作了恰当的叙述。
    本书的再一个特点，是作者根据美国共产党主席福斯特的著作和美国历史科学工作者如丰纳、爱伦、摩理士、罗乞斯特和阿泼推哥等的著作，一方面介绍了美国新史学界的研究成果，另一方面也批判了美国资产阶级历史编纂者一贯地歪曲和捏造的美国历史，驳斥了为金融寡头服务的反动历史理论“美国例外论”。同时对于美国政治史上的许多重要问题，例如美国政党的性质，杰斐逊、杰克孙和司蒂文斯的资产阶级民主运动，南北战争和重建时期，十九世纪末叶的平民党运动，美国的民族压迫政策，歧视黑人和排华政策，威尔逊的“自由主义”以及罗斯福的“新政”，都作了比较具体的分析。
    一般而论，本书对于美国社会发展中的基础与上层建筑的关系是注意分析的。例如在第五章里作者说明了美国南北战争时期的美国社会的经济基础及其发展过程中在南部和北部所起的变化，基础对于美国的政治所起的影响以及最后终于爆发了内战。不过，关于意识形态的部分，即美国史上的关于哲学、自然科学、文学和艺术等方面，作者没有加以叙述，这是本书的一个缺陷。
    但是，本书中叙述美国与中国的关系部分，似嫌过于简略。作者假如能够把美国史与中美关系史结合起来，就美国历史上各个时期的资本主义经济危机，来分析各该时期美国统治集团为摆脱经济危机而推行的向外扩张，特别是近几十年来加紧对中国的侵略等问题，则读者读了本书以后，不仅可以认识到美国历史发展的趋向，而且对于美国帝国主义的本质及其凶恶面貌将得到更深刻的认识。此外，作者认为美国未曾参加一八五七年英法联军之役（原书第一三九页），这也是不符合事实的。
    最后，应该指出，“美国简明史”是作者积多年的实际工作、教学与研究的心得而写成的。它是解放以来我国历史学界第一部用新观点写的关于外国通史的著作。作者写作的态度是认真的，是实事求是的。书中虽然还有缺点，但是这本书的价值并不因此而贬损，同时这也正说明了运用历史唯物主义编写外国史是一件艰巨的工作。希望文化界和出版界提倡以这种认真的、实事求是的态度，编写更多的好书，来满足全国人民在文化生活上的需要。
