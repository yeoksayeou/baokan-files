Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 26th: TASS Moscow, June 25th: On June 24, 1954, Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov received a telegram from Mr. Guillermo Toriello, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Guatemala. The text is as follows: To the Soviet Foreign Minister in Moscow:

    I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that although on June 20, 1954, the Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution stipulating the immediate cessation of all actions that may lead to bloodshed and recommending that all members of the United Nations refuse to support such actions by mercenaries infiltrating Guatemala from the Republic of Honduras, however, until now, this aggression has not stopped. On the contrary, as my government has declared to the Security Council, these armed forces continue to utilize the airfields of Honduras and Nicaragua to obtain practical assistance, and take advantage of the improper tolerance of the governments of these two UN member states.

    I urgently inform Your Excellency, hoping that Your Excellency can be aware of this serious situation, and request that your government, which has consistently and resolutely opposed aggression and safeguarded the principles of the United Nations, intervene as a member of the Security Council, and use the rights granted to it by the Security Council Charter to enable this high-level body, at its next meeting, to use its prestige to effectively implement the Security Council’s resolution of June 20 this year, and take corresponding measures to supervise the implementation of this resolution.

    I would like to express in advance my most sincere thanks to Your Excellency for the actions that your government will take in this difficult matter. The prestige of the United Nations and the security, sovereignty, and independence of a member of the United Nations depend on the resolution of this event.

    I take this opportunity to express to Your Excellency my highest and special respect.

                  Minister of Foreign Affairs
                      Guillermo Toriello

    The following is the reply telegram from V.M. Molotov to Mr. Guillermo Toriello on June 25th: To Mr. Guillermo Toriello, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Guatemala:

    I have the honor to have received Your Excellency's telegram of June 23 and to inform Your Excellency: The Soviet government, which is filled with deep sympathy for the Guatemalan people who are defending the freedom and independence of their country, has fully noted the request made in Your Excellency's telegram, and has instructed the Soviet representative to the United Nations to take all possible measures to ensure the implementation of the Security Council’s resolution of June 20 this year.

    I take this opportunity to express to Your Excellency my highest respect.

                Soviet Foreign Minister
                        V.M. Molotov

    危地马拉外长致电苏联外长莫洛托夫
    请求苏联促使安理会采取措施制止侵略
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十五日讯：一九五四年六月二十四日，苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫收到危地马拉外交部部长吉·托里埃略先生一封电报，电文如下：莫斯科苏联外交部部长：
    我很荣幸地告知阁下：虽然一九五四年六月二十日安全理事会一致通过一项决议，规定立即停止一切可能导致流血的行动，并建议所有联合国会员国拒绝对自洪都拉斯共和国境内侵入危地马拉的雇佣军的这种行动进行支援，然而直到现在，这种侵略还没有停止。相反，正如我国政府已向安全理事会声明的那样，这些武装力量继续在利用洪都拉斯和尼加拉瓜的飞机场获得实际的援助，并利用这两个联合国会员国政府方面的不正当的容忍。
    我迫切地告知阁下，希望阁下能够知道这种严重的情况，请求一贯坚决反对侵略和维护联合国原则的贵国政府，以安全理事会理事国的资格出面过问，并利用安全理事会章程所赋予它的权利，使这个高级机构在下一次会议上得以利用它的威信，促使今年六月二十日安全理事会的决议能够有效地执行，并采取相应的措施监督这个决议的执行。
    我预先向阁下表示我最真诚的谢意，感谢贵国政府将会在这种困难的事情上所采取的行动。联合国的威信以及一个联合国会员国的安全、主权和独立都有赖于这一事件的解决。
    我借此机会向阁下表示我最崇高的和特别的敬意。
                  外交部部长
                      吉勒摩·托里埃略
    六月二十五日维·米·莫洛托夫给吉·托里埃略先生的回电如下：危地马拉外交部部长吉勒摩·托里埃略先生：
    我很荣幸地接到阁下六月二十三日的电报并通知阁下：对正在捍卫自己国家的自由和独立的危地马拉人民充满深刻同情的苏联政府，充分地注意到了在阁下的电报中所提出的请求，并已指令苏联驻联合国代表采取力所能及的一切措施，以保证今年六月二十日安全理事会的决议的执行。
    我借此机会向阁下表示我最崇高的敬意。
                苏联外交部部长
                        维·米·莫洛托夫
