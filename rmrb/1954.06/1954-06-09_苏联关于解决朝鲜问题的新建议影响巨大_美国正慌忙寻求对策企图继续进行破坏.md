Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 7th. (By our special correspondent Shen Jiantu) Because the sixteen-nation delegation had to wait for instructions from their respective governments, the restricted meeting on the Korean issue, originally scheduled for the 7th, was postponed. This made people here pay even closer attention to the positive contribution of the five new proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation to break the deadlock on the Korean issue. It is no secret in Geneva that the United States delegation hopes to terminate the discussion on the Korean issue. However, the constructive suggestions made by the Soviet delegation have been very well received, so it is now difficult for Smith to reject them outright. Despite pressure from the United States, many Western delegations have expressed interest in the Soviet proposals.

People should remain vigilant about the actions of the United States delegation in awaiting government instructions. Washington needs some time to coerce its allies into supporting the United States' policy to counter the new Soviet proposals. Agence France-Presse reported on the 6th that the sixteen nations led by the United States will hold talks to make these allies comply with the United States' approach to dealing with the new Soviet proposals.

The London "Times" admitted on the 7th that Foreign Minister Molotov "has put forward proposals that are difficult to oppose," although the newspaper attempted to diminish the importance of the proposals. The newspaper also confirmed that the United States "has asked many delegations to insist that any elections in Korea must be supervised by the United Nations, but it is clear that some Western delegations do not insist on United Nations supervision of the elections if effective neutral nation supervision can be guaranteed." The deadlock in the discussion of the Korean issue has dragged on for six weeks because the United States has put forward the unacceptable demand that the United Nations, one of the belligerent parties in the Korean War, supervise the elections.

The United States spokesman tried to dismiss the Soviet proposals on the 5th, while some Western countries' delegations expressed interest in the Soviet proposals. The Dutch representative attending the meeting said that he listened to the proposal with great interest and "must study it carefully." The spokesperson of the French delegation also said that the proposal needs to be studied.

So far, no delegation has publicly opposed the five proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation for reaching an agreement on the Korean issue. The United States delegation attempted to dismiss these principles with untenable excuses, arguing that it is meaningless to agree on principles when there are differences. This absurd statement is obviously an attempt to cover up the fact that the United States refuses to take the positive steps suggested by the Soviet delegation. As long as the principles on which the delegations agree are affirmed and concrete discussions are initiated to resolve the existing differences, a big step can be taken towards resolving the Korean issue.

Obviously, the United States delegation is unwilling to take this step, because it may lead to an agreement on the Korean issue. The obstacles caused by the United States' insistence on hostile United Nations supervision of the Korean elections and its refusal to withdraw foreign troops from Korea at the same time have brought the meeting to a standstill for more than a month. The delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union have shown their desire to resolve the Korean issue, pointing out that an agreement on principles will allow concrete discussions to be launched to eliminate the remaining differences hindering the resolution of the issue. Now, it remains to be seen whether the United States and other Western countries' delegations have the same desire to reach an agreement.

### 苏联关于解决朝鲜问题的新建议影响巨大  美国正慌忙寻求对策企图继续进行破坏

    苏联关于解决朝鲜问题的新建议影响巨大
    美国正慌忙寻求对策企图继续进行破坏
    【新华社日内瓦七日电】本社特派记者沈建图报道：因为十六国代表团要等候本国政府的指示，因此原定七日举行的讨论朝鲜问题的限制性会议宣告延期，这使得此间人士进一步注意苏联代表团为打破朝鲜问题僵局而提出的五点新建议的积极贡献。美国代表团希望终止关于朝鲜问题的讨论，这在日内瓦已不是什么秘密了。但是，苏联代表团提出的建设性的建议受到了很大的欢迎，因此现在史密斯很难断然加以拒绝。尽管有美国的压力，许多西方代表团还是表示对苏联的建议感到兴趣。
    人们对于美国代表团等候政府指示的行动仍须保持警惕。华盛顿需要一些时间来胁迫它的盟国支持美国的计划。法新社六日报道，以美国为首的十六国将举行会谈，为的是使这些盟国服从美国对付苏联新建议的方针。
    伦敦“泰晤士报”七日承认，莫洛托夫外长“已提出了人们很难加以反对的建议”，虽然该报企图贬低这个建议的重要性。该报还证实，美国“已要求许多代表团主张朝鲜的任何选举必须由联合国监督，但是人们清楚地看到：某些西方代表团并不坚持要由联合国监督选举，如果能够保证进行有效的中立国监督的话。”由于美国提出由朝鲜战争交战一方的联合国监督选举的这一不可接受的要求，因此讨论朝鲜问题的会议的僵局已经拖了六个星期了。
    美国发言人在五日企图把苏联的建议一笔抹煞，而某些西方国家代表团则对苏联的建议感到兴趣。出席会议的荷兰代表说，他很感兴趣地倾听了这个建议并“一定要仔细地去研究它”。法国代表团的发言人也说，这个建议需要加以研究。
    到现在为止，没有一个代表团公开反对苏联代表团提出的关于取得朝鲜问题协议的五点建议。美国代表团企图以站不住脚的借口来抹煞这些原则，它的借口是：既然存在分歧，同意原则就没有什么意义。这种荒谬的说法显然是企图掩盖美国拒绝采取苏联代表团所建议的积极步骤的事实。只要把各代表团意见一致的原则肯定下来，着手进行具体讨论以解决现存的分歧，就可以朝着朝鲜问题的解决迈进一大步。
    显然，美国代表团不愿意采取这一步骤，因为它可能导致关于朝鲜问题的协议。由于美国坚持由联合国对朝鲜选举进行敌对性的监督并拒绝同时从朝鲜撤退外国军队而造成的障碍，已使会议有一个多月的时间陷于僵局。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中国和苏联的代表团已表明了它们要求解决朝鲜问题的愿望，它们指出，关于原则的协议将使具体的讨论得以展开，以消除妨碍解决问题的剩下的分歧。现在，就要看美国及其他西方国家代表团有没有达成协议的同样愿望了。
