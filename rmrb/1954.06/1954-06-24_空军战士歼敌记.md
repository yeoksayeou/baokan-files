    Air Force Warriors Eliminate the Enemy
    The valiant People's Liberation Army Air Force fighters recently dealt a heavy blow to the remnants of the Kuomintang Air Force that invaded the skies over our coastal area of eastern Zhejiang, achieving another victory in aerial combat and gloriously fulfilling their duty of defending the motherland's skies.
    On May 19th, the skies over eastern Zhejiang were drizzly, and the cloud cover was very low. Suddenly, four American-made Chiang Kai-shek bandit F-47 fighter planes appeared over the sea, using the cover of cloud and rain to attack a certain area in eastern Zhejiang. The command post of an air force airfield immediately issued the order to take off and meet the enemy. A signal flare soared into the sky, and pilots Wang Wanlin, Song Guoqing, Zong Defeng, and Yin Zongmao successively guided their silver swallows into the clouds.
    The four aircraft flew rapidly through the clouds and quickly discovered the enemy aircraft in the designated airspace. The lead pilot, Wang Wanlin, immediately ordered Song Guoqing: "I'll cover you, you attack immediately!" Song Guoqing's aircraft immediately rushed towards an enemy aircraft on the left. The distance between the enemy and our aircraft was rapidly shortening, and the reticle of our aircraft's sight had already framed the enemy aircraft's projection. Song Guoqing pressed the button, and a string of shells entered the enemy aircraft's cockpit. The enemy aircraft wobbled for a moment, then exploded in the air along with its bombs, and the wreckage of the destroyed enemy aircraft fell into the sea.
    After this enemy aircraft was shot down, the other three enemy aircraft frantically threw the bombs they were carrying into the sea at random, then turned around and fled for their lives. Wang Wanlin ordered his comrades behind him to speed up and catch up, and he himself made a left turn, rushing towards an enemy aircraft. This enemy aircraft swerved back and forth, desperately trying to avoid the attack of our aircraft. Wang Wanlin pulled up the control stick, rose to a certain height, and then suddenly dived down, opening fire directly at the enemy aircraft. The enemy aircraft immediately emitted red flames and black smoke, and plunged into the sea like a headless fly.
    At this time, Yin Zongmao was also chasing another enemy aircraft. This enemy aircraft lowered its altitude and flew close to the sea surface, trying to evade the attack of our air force fighters. However, Yin Zongmao immediately lowered his altitude as well, caught up with the enemy aircraft, and opened fire. He shattered the enemy aircraft in an instant. The only remaining enemy aircraft, at this time, was also wounded by Song Guoqing and fled, tilting and wobbling, into the distance.
    The heroic pilots safely returned to the airfield after defeating the enemy aircraft. Fishermen fishing at sea and farmers working in the coastal fields heard the sound of the aerial battle and saw the victorious silver swallows returning in formation, standing on the bows of their boats and on the edges of the fields, waving their hats and cheering towards the silver swallows.
    On the afternoon of June 3rd, the sun shone on the undulating waves of the sea, and occasionally a few wisps of thin clouds swept across the sea and sky. Just then, the command post of an air force airfield issued a signal: Take off and meet the enemy! In an instant, the engines of our war eagles roared, and four aircraft flew into the sky one after another, rushing towards the designated airspace to find the enemy aircraft.
    "Enemy aircraft spotted to the left front!" the number two wingman reported to the number one leader, the flight leader. Battalion Commander Zhou Kelin immediately issued the order: "Prepare to fire!" The brave pilots all accelerated and focused their eyes on the enemy aircraft, flying forward rapidly. At this time, the enemy aircraft also spotted our aircraft. Because our air force fighters had continuously inflicted heavy blows on the enemy aircraft, the enemy aircraft was frightened and tried to turn around and flee as soon as it encountered our aircraft. However, this time the enemy aircraft was unable to escape, because our aircraft had cut off the enemy aircraft's escape route. As the enemy aircraft turned to flee, it happened to face our aircraft head-on. The Battalion Commander immediately ordered:
  "Fire!" Our aircraft fired all weapons at the enemy aircraft, and the enemy flight leader's right wing was hit, emitting a wisp of black smoke. The remaining enemy aircraft immediately scattered and fled, attempting to escape over our aircraft. At this time, our number three flight leader, Squadron Leader Liu Liangyang, made a sharp turn and closely followed the enemy wingman. Our number four wingman, Ren Xuli, also closely followed to cover the flight leader. At the same time, our number one flight leader, Battalion Commander Zhou Kelin, also made a sharp turn and increased the throttle to chase the wounded enemy flight leader. When he chased to a distance of 400 meters, Zhou Kelin pressed the button, and shells immediately struck the enemy aircraft's wing and fuselage. The enemy aircraft crashed into the sea with thick smoke. After Zhou Kelin shot down the enemy flight leader, he glided down from high altitude to assist Liu Liangyang in attacking the enemy wingman. At this time, this enemy aircraft had already been wounded by our number two wingman, Du Jiuan, and was gliding to a low altitude to escape. Zhou Kelin and Liu Liangyang dived from the left rear and right rear above the enemy aircraft to attack, and the enemy aircraft immediately burst into flames and smoke in a series of shell explosions. The enemy pilot opened the cockpit cover and tried to parachute to escape, but Zhou Kelin fired another burst, the enemy aircraft's cockpit was blown to pieces, and together with the murderer on board, plunged into the sea.
    This is only a part of the heroic deeds of our air force fighters. It shows that our young air force is becoming increasingly strong, and any enemy's invasion will be disastrously defeated. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached picture)

    空军战士歼敌记
    英勇的人民解放军空军战士们，最近沉重地打击了侵入我浙东沿海地区上空的国民党残余空军，取得空战中的又一次胜利，光荣地完成捍卫祖国天空的职责。
    五月十九日，浙东上空细雨蒙蒙，云层很低。海面上空突然出现了四架美造蒋匪F—四十七型战斗机，敌机借着云雨的掩护，向我浙东某地袭来。我空军某机场指挥所立刻传下起飞迎敌的命令。一颗信号弹腾空飞起，飞行员王万林、宋国卿、宗德峰、尹宗茂先后驾着他们的银燕钻进云层。
    四架飞机在云层中急飞，很快地就在指定的空域里发现了敌机。带队长机王万林立刻向宋国卿下令：“我掩护你，你立刻攻击！”宋国卿驾驶的飞机马上向左边的一架敌机冲去。敌我飞机相隔的距离迅速地缩短着，我机的瞄准具的光环已套住敌机的投影，宋国卿按动电钮，一串炮弹打进了敌机的座舱。敌机摇晃了一下，便连同机上的炸弹在空中爆炸了，被炸毁的敌机的残片掉进了大海。
    这架敌机被击落后，另外的三架敌机慌慌张张地把带来的炸弹乱投到海里，然后各自掉头逃命。王万林命令后面的战友加快速度赶上，他自己来了一个左转弯，朝着一架敌机冲去。这架敌机摆来摆去，拚命想逃避我机的打击。王万林拉起操纵杆，上升了一个高度，然后一下子扎下来，直向着敌机开了炮。敌机马上冒出红火黑烟，像掉了头的苍蝇一样栽进了大海。
    这时候，尹宗茂也在追赶另一架敌机。这架敌机降低高度贴着海面飞行，想躲过我空军战士的攻击。但是，尹宗茂马上也降低了高度，追上敌机就开炮射击。一下子就把敌机打得粉碎。唯一剩下的一架敌机，这时也被宋国卿打伤了，一歪一斜地朝远方逃去。
    英勇的飞行员们打败了敌机后安全地返回机场。在海上捕鱼的渔民和在沿海田野中劳动的农民，听见空战的炮声，并看到获胜的银燕整齐地返航，都立在船头上和田边上挥动着帽子向银燕欢呼。
    六月三日下午，阳光照耀着波涛起伏的海面，偶尔有几片薄云掠过海空。就在这时，某空军机场指挥所发出信号：起飞迎敌！霎时我战鹰的马达怒吼起来，四架飞机一架跟一架飞向天空，直冲向指定的空域寻找敌机。
    “左前方发现敌机！”二号僚机向一号带队的长机报告。大队长周克林立刻发出命令：“准备开火！”勇敢的飞行员们个个加快速度，眼睛注视着敌机，向前急飞。这时，敌机也发现了我机。由于我空军战士不断给敌机惨重的打击，敌机一遇到我机就吓得要掉头逃跑。但是，这一次敌机却逃不及了，因为我机已截断了敌机的逃路。当敌机扭头逃命时，恰好和我机迎面相对。大队长马上下令：
  “开火！”我机炮火齐向敌机打去，敌长机右翼中弹，冒出一缕黑烟。其余的敌机立刻分散逃命，企图从我机上空逃跑。这时，我三号长机、中队长刘良扬来了一个急转弯，紧跟着敌僚机追去。我四号僚机任旭利也紧跟上来掩护长机。在这同时，我一号长机、大队长周克林也急转弯、加大油门追赶已经被打伤的敌长机。追到距离四百公尺时，周克林按动电钮，炮弹立刻打进敌机机翼和机身，敌机带着浓烟栽下大海。周克林打落敌长机后，从高空滑下来协助刘良扬攻击敌僚机。这时，这架敌机已被我二号僚机杜九安打伤，正滑到低空窜逃。周克林和刘良扬从敌机左后上方和右后上方两面俯冲下来攻击，敌机立刻在一阵炮弹爆炸声中冒起烟火，敌机飞行员揭开座舱盖想跳伞逃跑，被周克林又打了
  一阵炮，敌机座舱炸成碎片，连同机上的凶手一起坠入海中。
    这仅是我空军战士英勇事迹的一部分。它说明我青年空军已日益强大，任何敌人的侵犯，必将遭到惨败。（新华社）（附图片）
