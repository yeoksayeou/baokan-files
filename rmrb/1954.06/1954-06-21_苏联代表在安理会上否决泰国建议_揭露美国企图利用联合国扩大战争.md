Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 20th: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on June 18th to continue discussing and voting on the draft resolution submitted by the Thai delegation. This draft resolution proposed the establishment of a subsidiary body to observe the peace, dispatching its observers to the border areas of Thailand adjacent to Indochina.

At the meeting on the 18th, representatives from Denmark, Colombia, France, and the United Kingdom expressed their support for the draft resolution and announced that they would vote in favor. They groundlessly insisted that the Thai government's concerns about Thailand's security were "reasonable," and therefore the draft resolution proposed by the Thai delegation was "logical and appropriate."

Soviet representative Tsarapkin explained the Soviet Union's views on this issue. Tsarapkin said that the Soviet delegation voted against including Thailand's request on the agenda because the Geneva Conference was currently discussing the restoration of peace in Indochina. The foreign ministers and representatives of the permanent members of the Security Council, namely the Soviet Union, the United States, the People's Republic of China, France, and the United Kingdom, were all participating in this conference. Therefore, there was absolutely no need for the Security Council to discuss this issue. On the contrary, raising this issue would hinder the restoration of peace in Indochina.

Tsarapkin continued: Thailand's request for discussion of the issue of dispatching military observers to the border areas of Thailand adjacent to Indochina is an attempt to conceal a US intention to escalate the conflict in the region, expand the war, and undermine the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue. Now the United States wants to expand this war in order to suppress the national liberation movement in Indochina, subject the people of Indochina to foreign rule once again, and enable the United States to occupy a certain position in this region.

Tsarapkin said: The representatives of New Zealand, the United Kingdom, who spoke at the Security Council's last and current meetings, as well as other members of the Security Council, tried to downplay and minimize the significance of this issue, attempting to portray it as an insignificant, non-aggressive, and even technical measure. However, no matter how hard they try, everyone understands that the issue here is not simply limited to dispatching military observers to the border areas of Thailand adjacent to Indochina.

The Soviet representative pointed out that as early as March, April, and May of last year, a small but powerful group of figures in the United States with strong aggressive tendencies were increasingly loudly demanding armed intervention in Indochina affairs. The US aggressive bloc at that time wanted to use Thailand to demand that the Indochina issue be brought before the United Nations, with the clear aim of repeating the Korean-style adventure in Indochina. Tsarapkin said that at the time, world public opinion rightly believed that the attempt to submit the Indochina issue to the Security Council for discussion was an attempt by the United States to interfere in Indochina affairs. Therefore, it is no accident that the Indochina issue was submitted to the Security Council on May 29th in the form of an appeal from Thailand.

The hasty raising of this issue in the Security Council while the Geneva Conference was making progress demonstrates the panic of the US aggressive bloc, which fears that the Indochina issue will be resolved peacefully, making it more difficult for the United States to interfere in Indochina affairs and expand the Indochina war. Thailand's raising of this issue to the Security Council at this time is intended to conceal a US conspiracy: to entangle and further complicate the Indochina issue, and, if possible, to interrupt the discussion of this issue at the Geneva Conference. The Security Council's consideration of the issue raised by Thailand is the first step towards intervention, the first step towards US armed intervention in Indochina affairs and the national liberation war of the Indochinese people. Currently, there are attempts to do as they did in Korea under the banner of the United Nations.

Tsarapkin then cited reports from American newspapers to illustrate that the United States intends to use the raising of this issue at the Security Council meeting to achieve the following objectives: it intends to dispatch observers to the border areas adjacent to Indochina, provoke border conflicts, and so on, and then report to the Security Council that Thailand has supposedly been invaded, immediately convening a meeting of the Security Council or a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to pass resolutions in order to begin foreign troops' invasion of the people of Indochina. Tsarapkin continued: In this way, the issue would be the expansion of the conflict, using the Security Council's seemingly impartial resolution on dispatching observers there to plan foreign intervention in Indochina under the guise of the United Nations flag.

Tsarapkin pointed out that none of the American newspapers mentioned any threat to Thailand's security. Tsarapkin pointed out that neither the Thai representative's speech nor his draft resolution provided any basis to prove that some danger was threatening Thailand.

Tsarapkin pointed out that the very idea of dispatching observers to Thailand while Geneva is discussing the cessation of the war in Indochina and the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue proves that the real instigators of this draft resolution are concerned about the prospect of expanding the Indochina war. Because, if the aim is to resolve the issue peacefully, why send observers? French Prime Minister Mendès France said in the French parliament that his government will continue negotiations in Geneva with the aim of seeking a peaceful resolution to the Indochina issue within the next four weeks. It would be particularly surprising if the Security Council were to adopt the Thai draft resolution at this time.

Tsarapkin concluded: We should not assist the US aggressive bloc in expanding the Indochina war. Naturally, the adoption of the Thai proposal would exacerbate the situation in this region of Southeast Asia and would be a serious obstacle to the negotiations for a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue in Geneva.

Based on the above points, the Soviet delegation cannot support the draft resolution submitted by the Thai representative to the Security Council and will vote against it.

Subsequently, the President of the Security Council, US Representative Lodge, put the draft resolution to a vote. The majority of the Security Council, led by the US representative, voted in favor of the draft resolution. The Soviet representative voted against it. The Lebanese representative abstained. Due to the Soviet Union, a permanent member of the Security Council, casting a veto, this draft resolution, aimed at preparing the ground for US intervention and expansion of the war in Southeast Asia, was not adopted.

US Representative Lodge spoke after the vote. He did not offer any rebuttal to the facts listed by the Soviet representative regarding the US plan to expand the Indochina war, but simply made the same old attacks on the Soviet Union. Lodge finally hinted that the US delegation intends to continue pursuing its aims through the United Nations General Assembly.

### 苏联代表在安理会上否决泰国建议  揭露美国企图利用联合国扩大战争

    苏联代表在安理会上否决泰国建议
    揭露美国企图利用联合国扩大战争
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社纽约十九日讯：联合国安全理事会在六月十八日举行会议，继续讨论并表决了泰国代表团的决议草案。这个决议草案建议成立一个观察和平的维持的小组委员会，派遣它的观察员到泰国境内邻近印度支那的边境地区去。
    在十八日的会议上，丹麦、哥伦比亚、法国和英国的代表表示支持这个决议草案，并宣布他们将投赞成票。他们毫无根据地硬说，泰国政府对于泰国安全的忧虑是“合乎情理的”，因此泰国代表团所提出的决议草案是“合理和恰当的”。
    苏联代表查拉普金说明了苏联对这个问题的看法。查拉普金说，苏联代表团投票反对把泰国的要求列入议程的原因是：目前日内瓦会议正在讨论恢复印度支那和平问题。安全理事会的常任理事国，即苏联、美国、中华人民共和国、法国和英国的外交部长和代表都参加了这个会议。可见，安全理事会完全没有必要来讨论这个问题。相反地，这个问题的提出会阻碍印度支那和平的恢复。
    查拉普金接着说：泰国之所以请求讨论派遣军事观察员到泰国境内邻近印度支那的边境地区去的问题，是为了企图掩饰美国的一种打算，就是加剧这一地区的冲突、扩大战争并破坏印度支那问题的和平解决。现在美国想扩大这个战争，以便镇压印度支那的民族解放运动，使印度支那人民重新遭受外国统治，而美国自己却能在这个地区占一定的地位。
    查拉普金说：在安全理事会上次和这次会议上发言的新西兰、英国的代表以及安全理事会其他理事国力图降低和缩小这个问题的意义，想把它说成是一个无关紧要的、不侵犯别人的、甚至是技术性的措施。然而，不论他们如何卖尽气力，大家都很明白，问题在这里并不简单地仅止于派遣军事观察员到泰国境内邻近印度支那的边境地区去。
    苏联代表指出：早在去年三、四、五月间，美国那些为数不多然而是很有势力的、侵略思想浓厚的人物，就在美国日益响亮地要求武装干涉印度支那事务了。美国侵略集团那时就想通过泰国要求把印度支那问题提到联合国去，其目的显然是要在印度支那重复朝鲜式的冒险。查拉普金说：当时，世界舆论就恰当地认为，把印度支那问题提交安全理事会讨论的企图，就是美国干涉印度支那事务的企图。因此，今年五月二十九日用泰国的呼吁的形式把印度支那问题提交安全理事会讨论，决不是偶然的。
    正当日内瓦会议有了进展的时候匆匆忙忙地在安全理事会中提出这一问题，这说明了美国侵略集团的惊慌，他们害怕印度支那问题会得到和平解决，以致使美国想干涉印度支那事务和扩大印度支那战争的企图更加难以实现。泰国在这时候向安全理事会提出这一问题，是要掩饰美国这样一种阴谋：使印度支那问题纠缠不清和更加复杂，如果办得到的话，就在日内瓦会议上中断这一问题的讨论。安全理事会审议泰国所提出的问题就是走上干涉的道路，走上美国对印度支那事务和印度支那人民的民族解放战争进行武装干涉的道路的第一步。目前有人正企图打着联合国旗帜像在朝鲜所干的那样来干一下。
    查拉普金接着举出美国报纸的报道说明，美国企图利用在安全理事会会议上提出这一问题来达到下列目的：它打算派遣观察员到和印度支那邻近的边境地区去，挑起边境冲突等等，然后向安全理事会提出报告说，泰国据说受到了侵犯，紧接着就召开安全理事会会议或者联合国大会特别会议，通过决议，以便开始由外国军队来侵犯印度支那人民。查拉普金接着说：这一来，问题就会是扩大冲突，利用安全理事会的貌似公正的关于派遣观察员到那里去的决议，在联合国旗帜的掩饰下策划对印度支那的外国干涉。
    查拉普金指出，美国所有的报纸都没有一个字提到对泰国安全的任何威胁。查拉普金指出，无论从泰国代表的发言中，还是从他的决议草案中都找不出任何根据来证明有某种危险威胁着泰国。
    查拉普金指出，正当日内瓦在讨论停止印度支那战争和和平解决印度支那问题的时候，派遣观察员到泰国去的这一想法，本身就证明这一决议草案的真正发起者所注意的是扩大印度支那战争的前途。因为，如果要想和平解决问题，又何必派遣观察员呢？法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯在法国议会中说，他的政府将继续在日内瓦进行谈判，以期在最近四周内求得印度支那问题的和平解决。在这时候安全理事会如果通过泰国的决议草案，那就令人特别感到惊奇了。
    查拉普金最后说：我们不应该助成美国侵略集团扩大印度支那战争。很自然，泰国建议的通过将会促使东南亚的这一地区的情况尖锐化，并对日内瓦所进行的和平解决印度支那问题的谈判是一个严重的障碍。
    根据上述各点，苏联代表团不能支持泰国代表向安全理事会提出的决议草案，并将投票反对这个决议草案。
    接着，安全理事会主席、美国代表洛奇把决议草案付表决。以美国代表为首的安全理事会多数投票赞成这个决议草案。苏联代表投票反对。黎巴嫩代表弃权。由于安全理事会常任理事国苏联投了反对票，目的在于为美国干涉并扩大东南亚战争准备基础的这一决议草案，没有得到通过。
    在表决后发言的有美国代表洛奇。他对苏联代表在发言中列举的关于美国扩大印度支那战争的计划的各点事实没有作任何反驳，只是对苏联进行了老一套的攻击。洛奇最后暗示，美国代表团打算通过联合国大会来继续使自己的企图达到目的。
