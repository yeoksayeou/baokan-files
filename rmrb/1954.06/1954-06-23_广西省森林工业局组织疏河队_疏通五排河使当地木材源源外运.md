    Guangxi Provincial Forestry Bureau Organizes River Dredging Team
    Clearing the Wupai River Enables a Steady Flow of Local Timber Exports
    Last winter and spring, the river dredging team of the Guangxi Provincial Forestry Bureau spent more than three months dredging and blasting over 200 li of the Wupai River. Timber along the river can now be continuously transported out, increasing the income of farmers of all ethnic groups and gradually improving their lives.
    The Wupai River originates in the southern foothills of the Yuecheng Mountains at the junction of Hunan and Guangxi provinces, flowing through Xing'an and Longsheng counties in Guangxi Province. It is 210 li long and has abundant forest reserves along its banks, making it the largest forest area in Guangxi Province. However, due to the rapid water flow and numerous shoals, timber could not be transported out, resulting in the annual death or burning of many trees. Local farmers of all ethnic groups had to make a living by cultivating barren land to grow coarse grains and gathering wild vegetables every year, leading to very difficult lives. In 1951, the Central People's Government sent people to the area for investigation. Last year, the Guangxi Provincial Forestry Bureau sent a survey team to conduct half a year of investigation, surveying, and design work. Subsequently, a river dredging team of more than 500 people was organized to carry out more than three months of dredging and blasting work last winter and spring, completely blasting away more than 150 dangerous shoals in the river channel. The total length of the dredging project was 190 li, with a total of more than 25,000 cubic meters of stone removed. After the river channel was cleared, timber from this area has been continuously transported out, supplying the needs of national construction. At the same time, farmers of all ethnic groups have also increased their income significantly. Based only on the 50,000 cubic meters of timber purchased by the state in the area this year, farmers along the Wupai River can increase their income by 8.5 billion yuan, equivalent to eight or nine times their previous income.
    Farmers in the Wupai River area actively supported the river dredging project, supplying vegetables and meat to the river dredging team, voluntarily helping with grass cutting, shed building, and bridge construction, and participating in the dredging and blasting work. At the same time, they also actively carried out afforestation, forest protection, and logging work. This spring, a total of more than 300,000 trees were planted, and forest protection organizations were generally established and improved in various townships. The felled trees have all been made into timber during the river dredging period, and rafting and transportation began as soon as the river channel was cleared.

    广西省森林工业局组织疏河队
    疏通五排河使当地木材源源外运
    广西省森林工业局疏河队在去冬今春以三个多月的时间疏炸了二百余里长的五排河，沿河木材从此可以源源运出，各族农民收入增加，生活将逐渐改善。
    五排河发源在湖南、广西交界处的越城岭南麓，流经广西省兴安、龙胜两县，全长二百一十里，沿岸森林蓄积量很多，为广西省最大林区，但因水急滩多，木材无法外运，每年都要枯死或烧毁很多树木。当地各族农民年年只有开荒种杂粮和采摘野菜度日，生活十分艰苦。一九五一年，中央人民政府曾派人到该地调查，去年，广西省森林工业局又派出勘测队进行了半年的调查、勘测和设计工作。接着便组织了五百多人的疏河队，于去冬今春进行三个多月的疏炸工作，全部炸除了河道中的一百五十多处滩险。疏炸工程全线一百九十里，石方共有二万五千多立方公尺。河道疏通后，这一带木材已经源源外运，供应国家建设的需要。同时，各族农民也增加了大批收入，仅以今年国家在该地收购的五万立方公尺木材计算，五排河沿岸农民即可增加八十五亿元收入，相当于过去收入的八、九倍。
    五排河一带农民积极支援疏河工程，供应疏河队的蔬菜和肉食，自动帮助割草、搭棚和架桥，并参加疏炸工作。同时，他们还积极进行造林、护林和采伐工作。今年春季共造林三十多万株，各乡都普遍成立和健全了护林组织，砍伐的树木在疏河期间都已制成木材，河道刚一疏通便开始扎运。
