Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an. Recent technical innovation achievements have emerged in factories and construction sites in Xi'an, playing a significant role in breaking through weak links in production and construction, promoting production, and accelerating capital construction.

The state-owned Northwest Mining Machinery Repair Factory received a batch of well ring tasks for the renovation of Tongchuan Coal Mine in late April, and they had to be completed by early May. According to the factory's production capacity, this was very difficult to complete on time. However, thanks to the creation of a rounding machine by the factory's technicians, the previously considered most difficult process of rounding channel steel became very easy. This increased the rounding efficiency by twenty times, successfully completing the well ring production task on time and ahead of schedule, and provided conditions for supplying well rings for the construction of vertical shafts for various coal mines in the Northwest in large quantities in the future. In order to reduce the number of tools required to manufacture twelve-row seeders, Lei Ziming and Zhang Shusen, technicians at the Northwest Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Plant, created a dual-purpose fixture that allows more than forty kinds of parts in the twelve-row seeder to be made with this fixture, and the efficiency is at least doubled compared to manual operation. Wang Bocheng, a young worker in the casting workshop of the Northwest Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Plant, continuously improved the sand casting operation method several times, and made all preparations for production before work, increasing the sand casting efficiency of five-inch simplified plough tips by one and a half times. Li Shenglin, a technician at the jointly owned Zhongnan Match Factory, with the assistance of worker Zhang Yushi and others, created an electric machine for cutting matchbox outer pieces based on the principle of an electric stalk cutter, increasing efficiency threefold and saving a lot of wood.

In terms of basic construction, there have also been many technical innovation achievements. Especially in the construction of high-end buildings with national forms, workers have created many new operating methods, solving the difficulty of insufficient skilled technical workers in Xi'an. Yan Fulou, Gu Mudi, and Huang Sanhe, workers at the Fifth Construction Site of the Northwest Fourth Civil Engineering Company, created a prefabrication method for indoor flat-top patterns and flat-top lines, increasing work efficiency fourfold and saving cement and wood. Generally, third- and fourth-grade tilers can also use this method to make flat-top patterns and flat-top lines. Workers at the 301 Construction Site of the Xi'an Engineering Company recently successfully promoted the advanced experience of the Soviet "gas welding tee," which not only solved the difficulty of the current shortage of "tees" and "elbows" needed for connecting tap water pipes, heating pipes, etc. in Xi'an, but also made the pressure resistance after welding 110 pounds higher than the design requirements, fully ensuring the quality.

    西安各工厂和工地出现许多技术革新事迹
    【新华社西安讯】西安市各工厂、建筑工地最近出现了许多技术革新的事迹，对突破生产和建设中的薄弱环节，推动生产和加速基本建设起了很大作用。
    国营西北矿山机械修配厂在四月下旬接受了一批为改建铜川煤矿用的井圈任务，而且要在五月初完成。按照这个厂的生产能力，这是很难按时完成的。但由于这个厂技术人员创造了一种握圆机，使过去都认为最难的槽钢握圆这一工序，变得很容易，从而使握圆效率提高二十倍，胜利地按时超额完成了井圈生产任务，并为以后大批供应西北各煤矿建设竖井用的井圈提供了条件。西北农业机械制造厂技术员雷子明和张树森为了减少制造十二行播种机所需要的工具，创造了一种两用卡具，使十二行播种机内四十多种零件都可由这一卡具来作，并且比手工操作至少提高效率二倍。西北农业机械制造厂铸工车间青年工人王伯成，连续几次改进了翻砂的操作方法，并在上工前做好生产的一切准备工作，使五吋简化步犁尖翻砂效率提高一倍半。公私合营中南火柴厂技术员李盛林在工人张玉士等协助下，根据电动切梗机的原理，创造了电动切火柴盒外片的机器，提高效率三倍，并可节省许多木材。
    在基本建设方面，也出现了很多技术革新事迹。特别是在修建具有民族形式的高级建筑物中，工人们创造了许多新的操作方法，解决了西安市修建高级建筑物技术工人不足的困难。西北第四土建工程公司第五工地工人严福楼、顾目弟、黄三和创造了室内平顶花纹和平顶线条的预制法，使工作效率提高四倍，并可节省水泥和木材，一般三、四级瓦工也能用这种方法做平顶花纹和平顶线条。西安市工程公司三零一工地的工人们，最近推广苏联“气焊三通”的先进经验成功，不但解决了西安市目前连接自来水管、暖气管等所需要的“三通”“弯头”等器材缺乏的困难，而且使焊接后的耐压力比设计要求还高一百一十磅，完全保证了质量。
