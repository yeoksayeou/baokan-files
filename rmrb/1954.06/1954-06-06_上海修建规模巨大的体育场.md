    Shanghai Builds a Huge Stadium
    Shanghai's largest Jiangwan Stadium officially started construction on June 2nd. This construction project includes the entire athletic field and gymnasium. The athletic field (including the stands) covers a total area of 37,500 square meters and can accommodate approximately 60,000 spectators.
    Jiangwan Stadium was built in 1935. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it was occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang as an arsenal. A major explosion occurred in 1946, and part of the athletic field was destroyed. This reconstruction will include building a magnificent gate in the center of the south grandstand. The main entrance of the rostrum will also be rebuilt into a palace style with national characteristics. All tracks, ball fields, sand pits, roads, and sewers in the stadium will be completely repaired. Infiltration trenches will also be added to the field so that it can be used the day after heavy rain. The gymnasium, which can accommodate approximately 5,000 spectators, will be repaired as it was originally.

    上海修建规模巨大的体育场
    上海市规模最大的江湾体育场，已在六月二日正式开工修建。这次修建工程包括整个田径场和体育馆。田径场（包括看台）所占总面积是三万七千五百平方公尺，可容纳观众约六万人。
    江湾体育场是在一九三五年建筑的，抗日战争胜利后为蒋匪帮占作军火库，一九四六年发生大爆炸，田径场中部分被毁。这次修建，将在南端看台正中修建一个壮丽的大门。司令台正门也将修建成富有民族风格的宫殿式。运动场所有跑道、球场、沙坑、道路及下水道等都将全部修复。场内并要增加渗水沟，以便在大雨后的第二天即可使用。可容纳约五千观众的体育馆仍按原样进行修理。
