Workers in many towns and cities in Southwest China, including iron factories, farm tool manufacturing factories, and farm tool production cooperatives, manufactured a large number of farm tools this spring to support the production of farmers of all ethnic minorities. More than 50 farm tool processing factories, farm tool production cooperatives, and Han blacksmiths in Guizhou Province have manufactured a batch of farm tools for farmers of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province. Handicraft workers alone have manufactured more than 10,000 pieces. This spring, Yunnan Iron Factory and Jianyun Factory in Kunming City, Yunnan Province, cast more than 10,000 pieces of farm tools for farmers of all ethnic groups in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region.

Currently, Han workers in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan are rushing to manufacture free farm tools distributed by the People's Government to farmers of all ethnic groups. Guizhou Province alone will manufacture free farm tools worth 6.8 billion yuan.

In the past three years, Han workers in Southwest China have manufactured millions of iron farm tools for farmers of all ethnic minorities. Among them, Han workers in more than 20 cities and counties, including Chongqing, Chengdu, Yibin, and Ya'an, manufactured about 700,000 pieces of more than 40 kinds of farm tools for ethnic minority farmers in Xikang Province. State-owned trading organizations in Yunnan Province supplied iron farm tools worth more than 10 billion yuan to various remote ethnic minority areas, most of which were produced by Han workers in towns and cities such as Kunming and Pu'er.

Workers in various places are conscientious and responsible in their work, showing deep concern for the people of ethnic minorities. This spring, Han workers at the Maoxin Machinery Factory in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province, in order to deliver the more than 35,000 farm tools they contracted to manufacture to farmers of all ethnic groups in a timely manner, launched a red flag competition and a trick-finding campaign, which doubled production efficiency. Workers at the Southwest Farm Tool Factory worked day and night to manufacture farm tools for farmers in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province and strictly inspected product quality to prevent any defective products from leaving the factory. Before manufacturing farm tools, many farm tool processing factories and farm tool production cooperatives in Guizhou Province conducted investigations and research on the specifications and styles of farm tools used by farmers of all ethnic groups in the supply area. Some farm tool production cooperatives even let farmers try out the manufactured farm tools before continuing production. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西南各地工人制造大批农具供应各族农民
    西南区许多城镇的铁工厂、农具制造厂、农具生产合作社今年春天制造了大批农具，支援各少数民族农民生产。贵州省五十多个农具加工厂、农具生产合作社和各地汉族铁匠，已替贵州省各族农民制造了一批农具，仅各地手工业者就制造了一万多件。云南省昆明市云南铁工厂、建云工厂，今春为西双版纳傣族自治区各族农民铸造了一万多件农具。
    目前，云南、贵州和四川的汉族工人们，正在赶制人民政府发放给各族农民的无偿农具。仅贵州省各地就将制造价值六十八亿元的无偿农具。
    西南各地汉族工人在过去三年中，已为各少数民族农民制造了数百万件铁质农具。其中，重庆、成都、宜宾、雅安等二十多个市、县的汉族工人，为西康省少数民族农民制造了四十多种共约七十万件农具。云南省国营贸易机构供应各边远民族地区价值一百多亿元的铁质农具，大部是昆明、普洱等城镇的汉族工人生产的。
    各地工人在工作中认真负责，表现对少数民族人民的深切关怀。四川省藏族自治区茂新机械厂汉族工人，今春为了把他们承制的三万五千多件农具及时送到各族农民手里，开展了红旗竞赛和找窍门运动，使生产效率提高了一倍。西南农具厂工人日夜为西康省藏族自治区农民制造农具，并严格检查产品质量，不使一件废品出厂。贵州省许多农具加工厂、农具生产合作社在制造农具时，事前对供应地区各族农民使用农具的规格、式样，都进行了调查研究。有的农具生产合作社并把制造出来的农具先让农民试用，然后再继续生产。　（新华社）
