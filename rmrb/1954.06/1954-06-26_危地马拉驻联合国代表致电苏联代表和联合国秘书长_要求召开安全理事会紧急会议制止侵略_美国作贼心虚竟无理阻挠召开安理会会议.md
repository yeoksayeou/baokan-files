Xinhua News Agency: The Guatemalan Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Castillo Arriola, telegraphed the Soviet Representative to the UN, Charapekin, and sent letters to the UN Secretary-General, Hammarskjöld, and the U.S. Representative Lodge, the President of the Security Council for June, again requesting an emergency meeting of the Security Council to stop the armed aggression against Guatemala.

In his telegram to Soviet Representative Charapekin, Castillo Arriola said: On behalf of my government, I request the Security Council to hold an emergency meeting because other member states of the United Nations, in violation of Article 25 of the Charter, have still not fulfilled the resolution passed on June 20th. On the contrary, from yesterday (June 22nd) to noon today, more than forty-five cities and villages in my country have been subjected to air raids and strafing, and some cities, such as Sacapulas and Gualán, have been bombed with 100-pound bombs. Peaceful residents of these cities have been machine-gunned.

The telegram said: News reports with photos provided by reliable sources in American newspapers show that the aggressors' headquarters and airport are located within the territory of the Republic of Honduras. The Security Council must understand this situation. Therefore, my government requests your sincere and valuable cooperation to prompt the Security Council to meet no later than tomorrow (June 24th) to send a fact-finding committee as soon as possible to report truthfully to the Security Council on the aggression against Guatemala and implement the resolution of June 20th, that is, the Security Council should take the most decisive measures to stop this aggression from continuing.

In his letter to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, Castillo Arriola said: After the Security Council passed a resolution at its meeting on the 20th, it has full authority to deal with this issue, namely: it should not only demand that those member states assisting the aggression against the Republic of Guatemala abandon such actions, but also reject the proposal of the Brazilian and Colombian delegations, which suggested that the issue of aggression against Guatemala be handed over to the Organization of American States for discussion.

According to international law, the Organization of American States has no right to take measures because: 1. The government of Guatemala, as the object of aggression, specifically invoked its right to demand that the organization not discuss this issue; 2. According to Article 103 of the UN Charter, when the obligations assumed by Guatemala as a member of the United Nations under this Charter conflict with any obligations it owes to the Organization of American States, its obligations to the United Nations shall take precedence; 3. Guatemala can be considered a member of this organization, but if we are talking about the specific situation at present, it has not yet finally ratified the main agreements concluded by this organization in Rio de Janeiro and Bogotá. It can be seen from this that neither the Organization of American States itself nor the American States Peace Committee, as a component of it, can deal with the issue of aggression against Guatemala. Another reason is that its powers are limited to dealing with conflicts between its member states, and Guatemala has certainly not had any conflict with its neighbors, Honduras and Nicaragua.

U.S. Representative Lodge unreasonably rejected the Guatemalan government's reasonable request to convene the Security Council.

In a statement issued after receiving the letter from the Guatemalan representative, Lodge repeated the view expressed in the suggestion jointly made by Brazil and Colombia under the direction of the U.S. government on the 20th, which was immediately opposed by the Soviet Union and therefore not adopted: that the event of aggression against Guatemala be handed over to the American States Peace Committee of the Organization of American States for handling. As everyone knows, the Organization of American States is an agency used by the United States to promote its aggressive policies in Latin America. Lodge insisted that the Security Council was not suitable for taking action to safeguard peace in the face of this obvious aggression. In order to conceal the U.S.'s responsibility for orchestrating this armed invasion and to prevent the Security Council from taking action to stop the aggression, Lodge even described this aggression, which even American news agencies admitted there was ample evidence to show was orchestrated and supported by the U.S., as a "civil war."

    危地马拉驻联合国代表致电苏联代表和联合国秘书长
    要求召开安全理事会紧急会议制止侵略
    美国作贼心虚竟无理阻挠召开安理会会议
    据新华社讯：危地马拉常驻联合国代表卡斯蒂略—阿里奥拉打电报给苏联驻联合国代表查拉普金并致函联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德和安全理事会六月份的主席美国代表洛奇，再次要求召开安全理事会紧急会议以制止对危地马拉的武装侵略。
    卡斯蒂略—阿里奥拉在致苏联代表查拉普金的电报中说：我谨代表我的政府要求安全理事会举行紧急会议，因为联合国的其他会员国破坏宪章第二十五条，仍然没有履行六月二十日通过的决议。相反的，从昨天（六月二十二日）到今天中午为止，我的国家内已经有四十五个以上的城市和村庄遭到空袭和扫射，有些城市像萨卡柏、瓜兰等已经遭到了一百磅重的炸弹的轰炸。这些城市的和平居民遭到了机枪扫射。
    电报说：美国报纸上刊载的可靠人士提供的附有照片的新闻报道，说明侵略者的总部和飞机场座落在洪都拉斯共和国境内。安全理事会必须了解这种情况，因此，我的政府要求您的恳切的、有价值的合作来促使安全理事会至迟在明天（六月二十四日）举行会议，以尽速派出一个视察委员会向安全理事会忠实地报告危地马拉遭受侵略的情况，贯彻六月二十日的决议，就是安全理事会采取最果断的措施来制止这种侵略继续下去。
    卡斯蒂略—阿里奥拉在致联合国秘书长哈马舍
   尔德的信中说：安全理事会在二十日的会议上通过了决议后，它有完全的职权来处理这一问题，即：它不仅应要求那些在援助对危地马拉共和国的侵略的理事国放弃这种行动，而且应否决巴西和哥伦比亚代表团的提案，这个提案建议将对危地马拉侵略的问题交给美洲国家组织讨论。
    根据国际法准则，美洲国家组织无权采取措施，因为：一、被作为侵略对象的危地马拉政府特别根据自己的权利提出了要求：这个组织不应讨论这个问题；二、根据联合国宪章第一百零三条，作为联合国会员国的危地马拉依据这个宪章承担的义务和它对美洲国家组织所负的任何义务有冲突时，它对联合国的义务应居优先；三、可以认为危地马拉是属于这个组织的，但如果就目前具体情况来说，它还没有最后批准这个组织在里约热内卢和波哥大所缔结的主要协定。由此可见，不论是美洲国家组织本身，或作为它的组成部分的美洲国家和平委员会，都不能处理对危地马拉的侵略问题。还有一个理由是，它的权力只限于处理它的会员国之间的冲突，危地马拉当然没有和邻国——洪都拉斯及尼加拉瓜发生任何冲突。
    美国代表洛奇无理地拒绝了危地马拉政府关于召开安全理事会的合理要求。
    洛奇在收到危地马拉代表的信件后发表的谈话中，重复了二十日在美国政府指使下由巴西和哥伦比亚联合提出的、但立即遭到苏联反对因而未获通过的建议的意见：将危地马拉遭到侵略的事件交给美洲国家组织的美洲国家和平委员会去处理。而正如大家都知道的，美洲国家组织是美国用来推行它在拉丁美洲的侵略政策的一个机构。洛奇硬说安全理事会不适于对这一明显的侵略局势采取保障和平的行动。为了掩饰美国一手策动这次武装侵犯的责任并阻止安理会采取制止侵略的行动，洛奇竟然将这次连美国的通讯社都承认有充分的证据是美国策动和支持的侵略说成是“内战”。
