Anshan Iron and Steel Products Shipped to South China

    A large batch of steel materials produced by Anshan Iron and Steel Company has been successively shipped to various parts of South China. Among the 170-plus commodities handled by the Second Business Department of the Guangzhou Branch of China National Hardware and Machinery Company, which specializes in large hardware and steel materials, Anshan Iron and Steel products account for more than half. Among them, there are more than 30 specifications of round iron and flat iron alone. The raw material for Guangzhou's nail-making industry, wire rod, was originally in short supply. Since Anshan Iron and Steel began supplying a large quantity of wire rods in March of this year, this problem has been satisfactorily resolved. In February of this year, when rural areas in South China were preparing to vigorously launch spring plowing, the Guangzhou Branch of China National Hardware and Machinery Company transported more than 1.44 million kilograms of materials for making hoes and other agricultural tools from Anshan, meeting the needs of the countryside in a timely manner.

    The employees of the Guangzhou Branch of China National Hardware and Machinery Company all regard the operation of Anshan Iron and Steel products as a very glorious task. The arrival of Anshan Iron and Steel's steel plates, seamless steel pipes, angle iron, light steel rails and other materials in Guangzhou is even more inspiring. The company's employees quickly transported and sold these materials to factories and mines in Guangzhou, Shantou, Haikou, Zhanjiang and other places. Guangzhou Construction Engineering Company, Shunde Sugar Factory and other units purchased a lot of steel plates, angle iron and other materials.

Regularly Understand the Needs of Factories

    The state-owned department store in Dahu Mountain Town, Heishan County, Liaoxi Province, has established regular contact with the Gaoshanzi Quarry. The department store sends people to the Gaoshanzi Quarry twice a week to understand the situation and provide supplies in a timely manner. In April, the quarry needed 2,000 pairs of rubber shoes. At that time, the ground was thawing and the roads were muddy, making transportation very inconvenient. The Dahu Mountain Department Store used consignment to directly deliver this batch of rubber shoes to the quarry. Recently, the store also timely supplied the Gaoshanzi Quarry with hardware materials for building warehouses. Their enthusiastic spirit of serving the factory has been welcomed by the employees.

Support Farmers in Rushing to Harvest and Plant

    Farmers in the First District of Changyang County, Hubei Province, are busy with summer harvesting and planting. The district supply and marketing cooperative, on the one hand, adopts the method of opening early and closing late, so that farmers can buy goods early in the morning and in the evening; on the other hand, it adopts the method of delivering goods to the countryside, sending small farm tools, cloth, edible salt and other necessities for production and life to the farmers; for some bulky large farm tools, it also adopts methods such as ordering, pre-selling and special delivery for supply.

    During the busy farming season, many local farmers like to wear shorts to work in the fields. The Chengguan branch of the cooperative specially prepared more than 340 pieces of shorts and clothing to supply to the farmers. This not only met the needs of the farmers, but also enabled women to free up more time to participate in agricultural labor.

Timely Supply of Summer Hoeing Production Materials

    The Xifeng County Cooperative Union in Liaodong Province promptly allocated a large number of summer hoeing production materials to the grass-roots supply and marketing cooperatives. More than 100 mobile supply teams in the county have gone to the countryside to deliver summer hoeing production materials to the farmers. By the end of May, 274 shovel cultivators, 8 paddy field weeders, more than 5,300 hoe blades, and a large number of "666" powder, lead arsenate and other items had been supplied to the farmers.

    This year, the county's supply and marketing cooperatives increased the variety and quantity of summer hoeing production materials according to the needs of the farmers. There are more than 40 kinds of major production materials, worth more than 1.5 billion yuan, an increase of more than 50% compared with last year. Many cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives have changed their style of "ignoring after pushing out the door" and actively explain the efficacy and usage methods of these commodities to the farmers. Xue Zhenfu's delivery team of the Gaolimuzi Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Sixth District also demonstrated the usage methods when selling ammonium sulfate and "666" powder, so that the farmers could master the usage techniques.

In-depth Mobile Trade in Pastoral Areas

    Mobile trade teams of trade companies in Huocheng, Qiemo, Tekes and other counties in Xinjiang Province have successively entered pastoral areas. The commodities brought to the pastoral areas by these mobile trade teams are mostly daily necessities such as tea, sugar, cloth and various groceries needed by the herdsmen. The mobile trade team of Huocheng County also brought rain boots and raincoats urgently needed by the herdsmen.

    Herdsmen are busy with lambing, raising lambs, mating and other tasks. After the cadres of the trade companies arrived in the pastoral areas, they were all delighted to sell their livestock and local products to the mobile trade teams and buy back living materials. The Huocheng County mobile trade team also ordered a batch of hides, wool and local products from the herdsmen, and paid the herdsmen a portion of cash or goods in advance to help some herdsmen solve difficulties in production.

Materials Exchange Meeting in Remote Townships

    The Industry and Commerce Section of the People's Government of Weng'an County, Guizhou Province, and local state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives jointly organized working groups to hold small-scale materials exchange meetings in six remote townships including Jianzhong and Gaoshui. The number of people participating in the materials exchange meetings was generally two or three times more than the usual number of people attending the market, and in some townships it even increased tenfold.

    At the materials exchange meetings, the farmers bought a large number of production materials and living materials. For example, 11 of the 39 households in the fourth group of Gaoshui Township bought agricultural tools. At the materials exchange meetings, state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives purchased more than 10,000 kilograms of flue-cured tobacco, rapeseed, tung seeds, gallnuts and other agricultural, sideline and native products from the farmers. The total value of transactions at the materials exchange meetings in these six townships reached more than 230 million yuan.

The Joy of Tea Farmers

    Since the beginning of the spring tea picking season, Mapu Town, Jinzhai County, Anhui Province, has presented a scene of prosperity. After the tea farmers sold their tea to the state, hundreds of people go to the department stores and supply and marketing cooperative outlets every day to buy goods. In April, the Mapu Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative supplied the tea farmers with nearly 250,000 kilograms of bean cake, 34,500 kilograms of fertilizer powder, and a large number of agricultural tools, feed and other items; the department stores and supply and marketing cooperatives also supplied the tea farmers with more than 1,000 bolts of cotton cloth and more than 14,900 kilograms of sugar.

    The lives of tea farmers have improved even more this year. Now tea farmers rarely buy homespun cloth and poor-quality cloth, but instead buy printed cloth and good cloth such as serge and khaki. Chen Changhai, a tea farmer, and his family of three all added a new set of clothes. He said: "In the past, 'one catty of tea for three sheng of rice' could only buy a little more than one chi of cloth, but now you can buy two or three chi, so life will naturally get better."

Porcelain from Jingdezhen and other places in Guangzhou

    The Guangzhou Company of China Native Produce Company recently ordered a batch of porcelain utensils with lower prices and suitable for the needs of the masses from Binyang County, Guangxi Province, and also ordered a batch of famous porcelain from the Jingdezhen Porcelain Industry Company of Jiangxi Province. They have now been transported to Guangzhou and are beginning to supply the citizens with daily utensils such as rice bowls, dishes, teapots, and teacups with lids. The floral patterns of these porcelains are generally very beautiful. Some rice bowls have embossed pink enamel and peace doves, and some rice bowls have three-color borders and "four children" patterns. In addition, there are also porcelains painted with ancient figures and various flowers. These handicrafts with rich national artistic characteristics have been welcomed by the people of Guangzhou.

Prepare Autumn Supplies Early

    The Nanjing Company of China Department Store Company began to organize the processing of autumn supplies more than a month earlier than last year. In the company's planned organization and processing for the third quarter of this year, sanitary clothing increased three times compared with the same period last year, cotton sweaters increased five times, cotton socks increased by 540,000 pairs, and towels increased by 560,000 pieces; other clothing, leather shoes and other commodities also increased significantly. In addition to supplying these commodities in Nanjing City, they will also supply the needs of many cities and rural areas inside and outside Jiangsu Province. The company paid attention to absorbing consumer opinions in organizing the processing. According to consumer feedback, it was difficult to buy sanitary clothing for children last autumn, so they specially formulated a plan to organize the processing of this commodity this year. The cadres responsible for organizing the processing also promoted processing units to study and improve product quality. The hat production cooperative established a "production research team" to specialize in studying and improving the colors and quality of products.

    更好地为生产和消费者服务
    鞍钢的产品运到华南
    鞍山钢铁公司出产的钢铁器材已经有很大一批陆续运到华南各地。中国五金机械公司广州市分公司专营大五金钢铁器材的第二营业部经营的一百七十多种商品中，鞍钢的产品占了一大半，其中仅元铁、扁铁就有三十多种规格。广州市制钉工业的原料——盘条原来很缺乏，从今年三月间，鞍钢供给大批盘条后，这一问题已经圆满解决。今年二月间，当华南各地农村正在准备大力开展春耕的时候，中国五金机械公司广州市分公司从鞍山运到一百四十多万公斤制造锄头等农具的材料，及时满足了农村的需要。
    中国五金机械公司广州市分公司的职工都把经营鞍钢的产品看作是一项十分光荣的任务。鞍钢的钢板、无缝钢管、角铁、轻钢轨等器材运到广州，更加振奋人心。该公司的职工迅速地把这些器材运销到广州、汕头、海口、湛江等地的厂矿里去。广州市建筑工程公司、顺德糖厂等单位采购了不少钢板、角铁等器材。
    经常了解工厂的需要
    辽西省黑山县大虎山镇国营百货商店和高山子采石厂建立了经常的联系。百货商店每周两次派人到高山子采石厂去了解情况，及时进行供应。四月间，采石厂需要两千双胶鞋，当时土地翻浆，道路泥泞，运输很不方便，大虎山百货商店便用托运的办法，直接把这批胶鞋送到采石厂。最近该商店还及时供应了高山子采石厂修建库房用的五金器材。他们这种热心为工厂服务的精神，受到了职工们的欢迎。

    支持农民抢收抢种
    湖北省长阳县第一区农民正忙于夏收夏种。该区供销合作社一面采用早开门、晚收场的办法，使农民能在清早和晚上购买货物；一面采用送货下乡的办法，把小农具、布匹、食盐等生产和生活必需品送到农民手里；对于一些笨重的大农具，还采用订购、预售和专送等办法进行供应。
    农忙期间，当地很多农民喜欢穿短裤下田。该社城关分销店特地准备了三百四十多件短裤和衣服供应给农民。这样不但满足了农民的需要，还使妇女们能多抽出时间来参加农业劳动。
    及时供应夏锄生产资料
    辽东省西丰县合作社联合社及时把大批夏锄生产资料分拨到基层供销合作社，全县已有一百多个流动供应小组下乡给农民送夏锄生产资料。五月底，已经供应给农民二百七十四台铲?机，八台水田除草器，五千三百多块锄板，及大批“六六六”药粉、砒酸铅等物品。
    今年该县供销合作社根据农民的需要，增加了夏锄生产资料的品种和数量。主要的生产资料，就有四十多种，价值十五亿余元，比去年增加了百分之五十以上。许多供销合作社的干部转变了“推出门不管”的作风，积极向农民讲解这些商品的效能和使用方法。第六区高力木子供销合作社薛镇富送货小组，在销售硫铵和“六六六”药粉时，还表演了使用方法，使农民能掌握使用技术。
    深入牧区开展流动贸易
    新疆省霍城、且末、特克斯等县贸易公司的流动贸易小组，已经先后进入牧区。这些流动贸易小组带到牧区的商品，大都是牧民需要的茶、糖、布和各种杂货等日用品。霍城县的流动贸易小组还带去了牧民急需的雨鞋、雨衣。
    牧民正忙于接羔、育羔、配种等工作，在贸易公司的干部到达牧区以后，都兴高采烈地把自己的牲畜和土产品卖给流动贸易小组，买回生活资料。霍城县流动贸易小组还向牧民订购了一批皮、毛、土产，先付给牧民一部分现款或货物，帮助一些牧民解决了生产中的困难。
    边远乡的物资交流会
    贵州省甕安县人民政府工商科和当地国营商业部门、供销合作社等单位联合组织工作组，先后到建中、高水等六个边远乡举办了小型物资交流会。参加物资交流会的群众一般都比往常赶场的人数多两、三倍，有的乡还增加到十倍。
    在物资交流会上，农民们买到了大批生产资料和生活资料。如高水乡第四组三十九户农民就有十一户买了农具。在物资交流会上，国营商业部门和供销合作社向农民收购了万斤以上的烤烟、菜籽、桐籽、五倍子等十多种农、副业产品和土特产品。这六个乡的物资交流会，成交总值达二亿三千多万元。
    茶农们的喜悦
    自从进入春茶采摘季节以来，安徽省金寨县麻埠镇呈现一片繁荣的景象。茶农们把茶叶卖给国家以后，每天到百货商店、供销合作社门市部购买货物的有几百人。在四月份，麻埠镇供销合作社就供应给茶农将近二十五万斤豆饼、三万四千五百斤肥田粉和大批农具、饲料等物品；百货商店和供销合作社还供应给茶农一千多匹棉布、一万四千九百多斤食糖。
    今年茶农的生活更加改善了。现在茶农们很少买土布和质量差的布匹，而是买花布和哔叽、卡其等好布。茶农陈长海一家三口人都添了一套新衣服。他说：“过去‘一斤茶叶三升米’，只能买一尺多布，现在能买两三尺，生活自然就好起来了。”
    景德镇等地的瓷器在广州
    中国土产公司广州市公司最近到广西省宾阳县订购了一批价格较低，适合大众需要的瓷器用品，同时向江西省景德镇瓷业公司订购了一批名贵的瓷器。现在已经运到广州，开始供应市民的，有饭碗、菜碟、茶壶、有盖茶盅等日用器皿。这些瓷器花彩一般都很鲜美，有的饭碗上有凹花的粉彩和平鸽，有的饭碗上有三色边和“四童子”花纹，另外还有绘有古装人物和各种花卉的瓷器。这些富有民族艺术色彩的手工业品，受到了广州市人民的欢迎。
    及早准备秋季用品
    中国百货公司南京市公司比去年提前一个多月，开始组织加工秋季用品。该公司今年第三季度组织加工的计划中，卫生衣比去年同时期增加三倍，棉毛衫增加五倍，棉袜增加五十四万双，毛巾增加五十六万条；其他服装、皮鞋等商品也都增加不少。这些商品除在南京市供应外，还将供应江苏省内外许多城市和农村的需要。该公司在组织加工中，注意吸收了消费者的意见。据消费者反映，去年秋天很难买到儿童穿的卫生衣，他们在今年便特地制订了组织加工这项商品的计划。负责组织加工的干部们还推动加工单位研究提高产品质量。帽业生产合作社就成立了“生产研究小组”，专门研究改进产品的花色和质量。
