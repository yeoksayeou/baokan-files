    A Great Happy Event for the Chinese People
    Mei Lanfang, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association
    After thorough discussions by all democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations across the country, the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has been promulgated. This is a great happy event worth celebrating enthusiastically by the people of the whole country. It lays an important cornerstone for our country's socialist construction. It symbolizes the more consolidated and closer unity of the people of the whole country, and it demonstrates the unparalleled majestic power of the Chinese people. Compared with the deceptive pseudo-"constitutions" manufactured in the past by warlords and reactionaries using bribery, manipulation, and other despicable and ugly means, we can more clearly appreciate the loveliness of the draft constitution personally formulated by the people today.
    On this joyous day, I would like to express my heartfelt joy and firm support.

    中国人民的大喜事
    中国戏剧家协会副主席　梅兰芳
    经过全国各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体深入地讨论以后，中华人民共和国宪法草案公布了。这是值得全国人民热烈庆贺的大喜事，它为我们祖国的社会主义建设安下了一块重要的基石，它象征着全国人民更加巩固紧密的团结，它显示了中国人民无比雄伟的力量。对比过去由军阀、反动派用贿选、包办等卑鄙丑恶的手段制造出来的骗人的伪“宪法”，就更加清楚地体会到今天由人民亲手制定出来的宪法草案的可爱。
    在今天这个喜庆的日子里，我愿意说出我由衷的喜悦和坚决拥护的心情。
