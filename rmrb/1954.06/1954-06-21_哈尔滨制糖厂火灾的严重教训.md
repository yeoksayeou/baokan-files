    The Serious Lessons of the Harbin Sugar Factory Fire
    Wang Gengsheng
    The vast number of workers in industrial and mining enterprises across our country are enthusiastically launching labor competitions to build our country into a great socialist nation. Leading cadres of industrial and mining enterprises are working diligently, constantly improving enterprise management, reducing various losses and waste, and continuously increasing production to accumulate substantial funds for the country's socialist industrialization. However, some leading cadres of factories and mines are doing the opposite; they are completely irresponsible for the enterprises the state has entrusted to them, and they are indifferent to state property. Ma Kun, Chen Zongkui, and others, the main individuals responsible for the fire at the Harbin Sugar Factory, are typical examples of this. In the short two months before the major fire in December of last year, this sugar factory had already experienced four fire alarms. Logically, the responsible cadres should have been alerted; but Ma Kun and the others were not. They remained calm and indifferent to the four fire alarms, failing to take any effective fire prevention measures. They didn't even bother to clean up easily combustible materials such as the torn burlap sacks and broken filter cloths that had been scorched in the main steam drum room. The insulation of the hot air pipes was very inadequate, and they never bothered to improve it. Some fire hoses were cut off, and some fire hydrants were removed. Everything was in a state of neglect. Two hundred and fifty billion yuan of state property was finally reduced to ashes in a major fire in the hands of these completely irresponsible people. It is entirely right that they were sanctioned by Party discipline and state law. What lessons should we learn from the Harbin Sugar Factory fire?
    First, it is necessary to educate all enterprise cadres and workers about cherishing state property and constantly enhance everyone's sense of responsibility towards it. In the Harbin Sugar Factory, such education was clearly abandoned or relaxed. When leading cadres lack a sense of responsibility and are careless, those below them become casual as well. Some workers even went to the main steam drum room to dry clothes and bake filter cloths after several fire alarms had occurred, ultimately leading to a serious fire accident due to the accumulation of miscellaneous items. Party and government organs and factory and mine leaders across the country must accept the painful lessons of the Harbin Sugar Factory fire, place education on cherishing state property in an important position, cultivate the socialist moral character of workers, instill in everyone a high sense of responsibility, and treat protecting state property as protecting their own eyes.
    Second, the leading comrades of all factories and mines must clearly establish the view that production and safety are consistent. In addition to the lack of responsibility of the leaders, the fact that all the workers in the Harbin Sugar Factory, especially some leaders, did not understand the relationship between production and safety was also a major cause of the serious fire. They simply emphasized completing production tasks, neglecting or ignoring daily fire prevention work, and even after four fire alarms, they remained unwary, eventually leading to a fifth fire and causing irreparable losses. They subjectively believed that they were emphasizing production, but the result was that everything was burned in a fire. Can this be considered emphasizing production? Therefore, all factories and mines must use this painful event as a warning, strengthen the education of all workers on safe production and security knowledge, and make safe production the goal of every worker. One of the important reasons why the fire at the Harbin Sugar Factory could not be extinguished in time was that the workers completely lacked fire prevention knowledge. During the rescue work after the fire, some people even threw the fire extinguishing liquid into the fire without opening it, and some workers even ran away at the sight of the fire. This situation must be resolutely changed.
    All factories and mines must regularly check their fire-fighting equipment and fire prevention systems, and pay special attention to improving fire-fighting equipment in key areas. The production power and water sources in factories should be separated from the fire-fighting power and water sources. Factories that already have them together should try to improve them as much as possible, and should not only consider economic accounting without considering the safety of the factory. Through this inspection, it is necessary to improve the fire prevention organization, set up necessary fire prevention equipment, formulate practical and feasible security responsibility systems, ensure that security work is the responsibility of designated personnel, and effectively manage fire prevention equipment and tools. Regular inspections should be conducted in key areas of the factory—important workshops, fire sources, and fire hazard areas. Only in this way can fires be prevented. Even when a fire occurs, workers can carry out effective rescue operations.
    Party and government organs at all levels, especially the people's supervisory organs at all levels, must strengthen supervision and inspection of industrial and mining enterprises. These organs must not be satisfied with their own verbal or written instructions to industrial and mining enterprises, but must carry out concrete supervision and assistance. In addition to conducting daily supervision of the operation and management of industrial and mining enterprises, supervisory organs should also include security issues as part of their inspection content. For accidents caused by serious neglect of safe production, responsibility should be earnestly investigated, and even necessary punishment should be given to those responsible to strengthen everyone's sense of responsibility. In the handling of the Harbin Sugar Factory fire, not only were those directly responsible for the fire punished, but also the mayor, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and the director of the Industry Bureau, who did not pay attention to fire prevention and security work. This is entirely correct. Only in this way can the bureaucratic attitude towards safety issues be effectively corrected, and daily inspection and supervision can be strengthened to eliminate liability accidents. Serious dereliction of duty personnel in major liability accidents should not only be given Party and administrative sanctions, but also legal sanctions. Some people think that legal sanctions should not be imposed for liability accidents, which is completely wrong. Personnel like Ma Kun, who are extremely irresponsible in their daily work, indifferent to state property, and fled on their own when the sugar factory caught fire, missing the opportunity to save losses, resulting in significant losses to state property, have actually become criminals of the state. Why should they not be subjected to legal sanctions? If a policy of leniency is adopted towards such people and such things, what guarantee is there for state property? Persuasion and education are the fundamental methods, but they must never be regarded as the only methods. There must be legal sanctions as an auxiliary means for education to be more effective. And in a broad sense, the implementation of legal sanctions against seriously derelict personnel is also an education for the vast number of cadres and the masses. It will make people understand that as a state worker, they must be responsible for state property; irresponsibility is dereliction of duty, and even a violation of the law. The establishment of this concept will greatly help eliminate liability accidents and complete the state construction plan.

### 哈尔滨制糖厂火灾的严重教训

    哈尔滨制糖厂火灾的严重教训
    王更生
    我国各地工矿企业中的广大职工，为了把我国建设成伟大的社会主义国家，正在热烈开展劳动竞赛；工矿企业的领导干部，正在兢兢业业地工作，不断地改善企业管理，减少各种损失浪费，并使生产不断提高，为国家的社会主义工业化积累大量的资金。但是，有一些厂矿的领导干部却与此相反；他们对于国家交给他们领导的企业完全不负责任，对国家的财产漠不关心。哈尔滨制糖厂失火的主要负责人马昆、陈宗奎等人，就是这样的典型。这个糖厂在去年十二月大火前的短短的两个月中，就发生过四次火警，按理说负责的干部们总应该有所警惕了；但马昆等人不是如此。他们对四次火警安之若素，无动于衷，没有采取任何有效的防火措施，甚至连总汽包室里曾经被烤燃过的破麻袋、破滤布等容易燃烧的东西都不收拾一下；热气管的保温装置很不严密，也始终没有稍作改善；水龙带有的被割掉了，消火栓有的被取消了，一切都是无人负责的状态。二百五十亿元的国家财产，在这些完全没有责任心的人的手里，终于被一场大火烧成了灰烬。他们受到党纪和国法的制裁，是完全应该的。从哈尔滨制糖厂失火事件中，我们应该吸取一些什么教训呢？
    首先，必须在所有企业干部和职工群众中进行爱护国家财产的教育，不断地提高大家对于国家财产的责任心。在哈尔滨制糖厂，这样的教育显然是被放弃或放松了的。领导干部缺乏责任心，马马虎虎，下边也就随随便便。有些工人甚至在发生过几次火警以后，还到总汽包室去晾衣服，烤滤布，结果终于以杂乱物品为媒介，引起了严重火灾事故。各地党政机关和厂矿领导方面必须接受哈尔滨制糖厂火灾事故的惨痛教训，把爱护国家财产的教育放到重要的地位，以培养职工的社会主义道德品质，使人人都具有高度的责任感，把保护国家财产看成像保护自己的眼睛一样。
    其次，所有厂矿的领导同志必须明确树立生产和安全一致的观点。哈尔滨制糖厂发生严重火灾的原因，除了领导者责任心不强外，全厂职工特别是某些领导者不懂得生产与安全的关系，也是重要原因之一。他们单纯强调完成生产任务，轻视或忽视平时的防火工作，甚至发生了四次火警以后仍不警惕，终于发生第五次火警，造成了不可挽救的损失。他们主观上以为自己是重视了生产，但结果是一把火烧得什么都没有了，这能算重视生产吗？因此，所有厂矿必须以这一惨痛事件警惕自己，加强对所有职工的安全生产和保安知识的教育，使安全生产成为每个职工的奋斗目标。哈尔滨制糖厂的火灾所以不能及时扑灭，其重要原因之一，就是职工完全缺乏防火知识。在失火后的抢救工作中，有的人竟把消火液原封不动地向火里扔，有的工人甚至见火就逃。这种情形必须坚决加以改变。
    各厂矿必须随时检查自己的消防设备和防火制度，特别要注意要害地方防火设备的改善。工厂中生产电源和水源，应同消防电源和水源分开。已经设在一起的工厂，应该尽可能设法改进，不能只是从经济核算出发，而不考虑工厂的安全问题。通过这种检查，要健全防火组织，设置必要的防火设备，要制订切实可行的保安责任制度，作到保安工作有专人负责，对防火设备和防火工具进行有效的管理。对工厂要害处——重要车间、火源火险处要作定期检查。只有这样，才能防止火灾的发生。即使在火灾发生时，职工也会进行有效的抢救。
    各级党政机关，特别是各级人民监察机关，一定要加强对工矿企业的监督检查。这些机关决不能满足于自己对工矿企业的某些口头指示或书面指示，而必须进行具体的督促和帮助。监察机关除了对工矿企业的经营管理等进行日常监督外，还应该把保安问题列为检查内容之一。对于因严重忽视安全生产而造成损失的事故，应该认真追究责任，以至给责任人员以必要的处分，以加强大家的责任心。在哈尔滨制糖厂火灾事故的处理中，不仅处分了对火灾负直接责任的人，而且处分了不重视防火保安工作的市长、公安局长和工业局长，这是完全正确的。必须这样，才能有效地纠正对于安全问题所采取的官僚主义态度，加强日常的检查和督促，以消灭责任事故。对于重大责任事故中的严重失职人员，不仅应该给予党和行政的处分，还应该给予法律的制裁。有些人以为对于责任事故不应该实行法律制裁，这是完全不对的。像马昆那样平时工作就极端不负责任，对于国家财产漠不关心，在制糖厂起火时迳自逃跑、坐失挽救损失的时机，以致造成国家财产的重大损失的工作人员，实际已经成了国家的罪人，为什么不应该实行法律制裁呢？对于这样的人和这样的事如果采取宽恕政策，国家的财产还有什么保障呢？说服教育是根本方法，但是绝对不能被看作唯一的方法。必须有法律制裁作辅助手段，教育才更能收效。而从广泛的意义上说，对严重失职人员实行法律制裁，也正是对广大干部和群众的教育。它会使人们懂得：作为一个国家工作人员，对于国家财产是必须负责任的；不负责就是失职行为，甚至就是犯法行为。这种观念的树立，将大大有助于责任事故的消灭和国家建设计划的完成。
