Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 11th: "Pravda" correspondent Zhukov commented on the progress of the Geneva Conference, saying: If we not only analyze the situation at the Geneva Conference, but also analyze the situation outside the conference, we cannot but come to the conclusion that the US representative is not concerned with the rapid restoration of peace in Indochina.

US Secretary of State Dulles said hypocritically at a press conference on June 8 that the role of the US delegation in the discussion of the Indochina issue was only as a "friend" of the French delegation and the "member states of the Federation," "just a friend who provides opinions at the request of others." This statement will only make everyone who pays a little attention to the progress of the Geneva Conference laugh. In fact, the US "friend" is deciding the action policy of all the Western delegations in Geneva and is exerting all kinds of pressure to achieve one single goal: to prove that it is impossible to reach an agreement on the Indochina armistice issue, therefore, there is no other way out but to further expand the war.

Writing here, Zhukov quoted what an American reporter said to him in a private conversation: The US State Department can at most agree to temporarily resolve the military aspects of the Indochina issue. A political solution is out of the question. The most important thing at the moment is to stop military operations in order to gain a respite. What is the respite for? The American reporter did not answer this question.

But if you look through French newspapers or some American newspapers, it is not difficult to find the answer. Those who are trying to expand the war in Asia need time to prepare their intervention. The United States is unwilling to start this intervention before the congressional elections this fall, because politicians are aware that if the government opens up a "second Korea," the ruling Republican Party will inevitably lose many votes.

That is why the Western delegations are constantly proposing the idea of a "respite."

Zhukov pointed out that this plan has nothing in common with the task of consolidating security, stopping the war in Indochina, and seeking lasting peace in Indochina.

The following two issues are of particular importance to the resolution of the Indochina issue: the issue of mutual relations between France and the Indochinese countries, and the issue of the internal political situation in the Indochinese countries.

Needless to say, the establishment of direct contact between the two sides would be of great significance to the resolution of these two issues. Here, it must be pointed out that the French side has not yet complied with the decision agreed upon by everyone on May 29, and has been slow to establish direct contact with the representatives of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the ground to resolve military issues.

Zhukov said that, as a result, the rapid study of military and political issues is of paramount importance to the resolution of the Indochina issue. The issues that need to be resolved first and foremost include: granting sovereignty and independence to the three Indochinese countries, holding free general elections in these countries, and withdrawing all foreign troops from Indochina. The withdrawal of foreign troops must be realized before the free elections, which requires a good solution to the military issues discussed at the meeting.

Zhukov wrote: These issues can and should be resolved as long as all participants in the conference are sincere. Zhukov said: However, the facts show that some people are clearly lacking in sincerity. For example, it must be pointed out that US Secretary of State Dulles made every effort to emphasize at a press conference on June 8 that the Geneva Conference has no future, and hinted that the French delegation should sabotage the conference. Dulles threatened that if France does not listen to the advice of its US "friends," the US will refuse to provide France with military aid.

Zhukov finally said that this disgusting "advice" naturally aroused resistance even from reactionary French people, who understand that the US ruling clique is forcing France to prolong and expand the Indochina war in order to further weaken France and place it under its own influence.

### “真理报”记者评杜勒斯在六月八日的演说

    “真理报”记者评杜勒斯在六月八日的演说
   【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：“真理报”驻日内瓦记者茹科夫评论日内瓦会议的进程说：如果我们不只是分析日内瓦会议会上的情形，而且也分析一下会外的情形的话，那就不能不得出一个结论：美国代表不关心迅速恢复印度支那和平。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯六月八日在记者招待会上假惺惺地说，美国代表团在讨论印度支那问题的会议上所起的作用只是法国代表团和“联邦成员国”代表团的“朋友”，“只是一个应别人的请求而提供意见的朋友”。这种说法只会引起每一个多少注意一点日内瓦会议的进程的人发笑。实际上是美国“朋友”在决定着日内瓦的所有西方国家代表团的行动方针，并为此而施行种种压力以达到一个唯一的目的：证明就印度支那停战问题达成协议是不可能的，因此，除了进一步扩大战争之外，就没有别的出路。
    写到这里，茹科夫引述了一个美国记者和他私人谈话时所说过的话：美国国务院最多只能同意暂时解决印度支那军事方面的问题。政治解决根本就谈不上。目前最主要的就是停止军事行动，以获得喘息的机会。喘息是为了什么呢？那位美国记者没有回答这个问题。
    但如果翻一翻法国报纸或某些美国报纸，那就不难找到答案。力图扩大亚洲战争的人，是需要时间来准备他们的干涉行动的。美国不愿在今年秋季国会选举前开始这种干涉，因为政客们心里明白：如果政府一开辟“第二朝鲜”，目前执政的共和党必然会失掉很多选票。
    正因为如此，西方代表团才不断地提出“喘息”这一说法。
    茹科夫指出，这种计划是与巩固安全、停止印度支那战争以及求得印度支那持久和平的任务毫无共同之处的。
    下面两个问题对解决印度支那问题具有特别重要的意义：法国与印度支那各国之间的互相关系问题，印度支那各国内部政治局势问题。
    不待说，双方建立直接接触，对这两个问题的解决会有重要的意义。这里不能不指出，法国方面直到现在还不遵守五月二十九日大家所同意的决定，迟迟不与越南民主共和国代表在当地建立直接接触来解决军事问题。
    茹科夫说，这一来，从速研究军事问题和政治问题，对解决印度支那问题就具有头等的意义。急待首先解决的问题有：给三个印度支那国家以主权和独立的问题，在这些国家中举行自由普选的问题，从印度支那境内撤出一切外国军队的问题。外国军队的撤退必须在自由选举之前实现，这就要求很好地解决会上讨论过的军事问题。
    茹科夫写道：只要所有参加会议的人都具有诚意，这些问题是能够而且应当解决的。茹科夫说：可是，事实说明，某些人显然是缺乏诚意的。譬如，不能不指出，美国国务卿杜勒斯就在六月八日记者招待会上竭力强调说，日内瓦会议是没有前途的，并且暗示法国代表团应当破坏这个会议，杜勒斯威胁说，如果法国不听美国“朋友”的忠告，美国将拒绝给法国军事援助。
    茹科夫最后说，这种讨厌的“忠告”，很自然地甚至引起了反动的法国人士的反抗，这些人明白，美国统治集团强迫法国拖延和扩大印度支那战争，是为了要更加削弱法国，并使法国处于自己的影响之下。
