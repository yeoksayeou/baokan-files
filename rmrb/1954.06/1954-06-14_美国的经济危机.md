The United States has numerous economic research institutions, employing thousands of economists and statisticians. However, they have never been able to accurately predict the course of economic cycles. The onset of each crisis of overproduction takes them by surprise, like a bolt from the blue. These research institutions possess a wealth of statistical material, which, despite some falsification, still allows for a clearer assessment of the American economic situation than is possible for any other capitalist country.

The problem lies in the fact that only a scientific theory that is uniquely correct and reveals the true objective laws of capitalist development—that is, the Marxist-Leninist economic doctrine—can correctly synthesize and analyze statistical material related to the development and movement of the capitalist economy. Only by basing oneself on Marxism-Leninism can one correctly predict the course of current economic development. However, the Marxist-Leninist theory of the cyclical process of capitalist reproduction is closely related to the Marxist-Leninist theory of the capitalist mode of production in general, the theory of the historical temporality of this mode of production, and the theory of the objective laws of its development inevitably leading to its demise.

It is not surprising that bourgeois "economic researchers" do not want to know about the existence of objective laws governing capitalist economic development. They believe that economic development and movement are determined by subjective factors. They are blinded by the enormous power of modern monopoly capital and cannot understand that the activities of vast monopolies can be determined by some objective laws. Therefore, bourgeois experts studying capitalist economic changes can never reveal the true causes and nature of these changes.

A year ago, it was already apparent that an economic crisis in the United States was looming. At that time, the output of consumer goods had exceeded the purchasing power of American residents. The production of shoes, textiles, and other consumer goods needed by the working masses had already begun to decline. However, capitalists and their hired scholars were unwilling to pay attention to this at all.

Although the continuous increase in commodity inventories clearly indicated that the United States had entered a long period of overproduction, the output of other goods, especially the means of production, continued to rise. Even when industrial production had passed its peak, the increase in commodity stockpiles did not stop. According to materials from the U.S. Federal Reserve System, the old industrial production index reached its highest level in March 1953, while the new index, compiled to dilute the crisis situation, reached its peak in July 1953. Profits remained high, and capitalists were unwilling to curtail production.

Therefore, by the end of 1953, the goods accumulated in industry, wholesale trade, and retail trade had reached $82 billion. In addition, the government held inventories—wheat, cotton, and other agricultural products—worth about $7 to $8 billion. The government purchased these commodities to maintain high prices for the benefit of large monopolists. The Army, Navy, and Air Force also held large inventories, not only of weapons, equipment, and ammunition but also of various other commodities. U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Army, Johnson, stated at a press conference that the ground forces alone held approximately $35 billion worth of goods. For example, the military had 24 million pencils in stock! It can be seen from Johnson's statement that the military purchased goods it did not need from "connected" capitalists at high prices and then resold these goods to other capitalists, again to "connected" people, at only one-eighth of the original purchase price.

By the end of 1953, the inventories held by private individuals and the government were almost equal to the total annual consumption of the United States. Moreover, the number of consumer goods sold on credit and installment plans was increasing, meaning that consumers' future income was being counted against their future purchasing power. Consumer debt had reached $28 billion. A crisis of overproduction was unavoidable.

The American ruling circles and their experts tried to deny the existence of a crisis. In January 1954, President Eisenhower declared in his message to Congress:

"The slight changes that occurred in the economy in mid-1953 seem to be coming to an end soon."

Even now, bourgeois economists, capitalists, and leaders of right-wing trade unions are unanimously insisting that there is no real crisis, only a "readjustment" and slow decline in production, which will soon be followed by a new rise. However, this statement is incorrect because the current decline in American production is more severe than any previous modern American economic crisis—except for the 1929 crisis. The following is the new index of industrial production, taking into account so-called "seasonal variations" (with 1947-1949 as 100):

		1953		1954
	July	October	December	January	February	March
	137	132	126	125	123	123

According to the latest statistics, industrial production has declined by 10.2 percent in the first seven months of the current crisis. In the first seven months of previous crises, according to the statistics at the time, the production decline was as follows (percentage):

	1920	1929	1937	1948
	9	23	6	6

Only the 1929 crisis had a more drastic decline in production at the beginning, but in the later months of that crisis's development, there was a temporary rise in production: in the ninth month of the crisis, production had only declined by a total of 13 percent. Although these statistics are not precise enough, they still correctly indicate the general trend.

Although crises of capitalist overproduction are caused by the contradiction between the social nature of production and the private capitalist form of appropriation, each crisis has its own characteristics. These characteristics are determined by: 1. Changes in capitalism itself, its transition to imperialism and the stage of the general crisis of capitalism; 2. The characteristics of the previous stage of the economic cycle.

Based on these two points, we can identify some of the characteristics of the current crisis: the large surplus of loan capital accompanied by inflation; the large surplus of fixed capital, especially in the military production sector that expanded rapidly due to the aggression against Korea; the arms race and huge military orders, which allowed monopoly capital to continue to maintain high profits while further reducing the purchasing power of residents. Naturally, it is too early to identify all the characteristics of the crisis that is currently developing.

The claim that there is no crisis now, only a slight production decline, gains traction because monopolists have hardly felt the weight of the crisis so far. Although sales have declined overall, in the initial stages, this has been limited to non-monopoly companies or weaker monopolies. For example, a year ago, the three largest automobile monopolies—General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler—accounted for 87 percent of the total automobile production in the United States, while smaller automobile companies accounted for 13 percent. Now, the products of small automobile companies account for only 4 percent.

Monopoly capital maintains high product prices, reduces labor wages by canceling overtime work that requires high wages and lowering hourly wage quotas, and profits from the decline in raw material prices. This year, some of the largest monopolies will receive billions of dollars in "gifts" from the U.S. government, known as the "Government of the Eight Great Financial Groups," in the form of tax relief from "excess profits" taxes and lower income taxes. Some of these monopolies—General Motors, Ford, and U.S. Steel—are even using the existing large amount of low-interest loans to expand their production capacity during the crisis. For example, U.S. Steel announced in early March that it would begin constructing the largest blast furnace in the United States, capable of producing 1,350 tons of milled iron per day. However, smaller monopoly capital and metallurgical companies have generally reduced new investment in production.

The profits of monopoly capital remain at a high level. In addition, over the past decade, monopoly capital has accumulated huge amounts of public and hidden reserves from its huge profits. This is the reason for the stability of their stock prices and the sharp decline in the stock prices of small companies.

As for the working people, the crisis continues to deal them a major blow.

Official statistics, which try to conceal the bleak reality in various ways, announced at the beginning of 1954 that the number of unemployed was 2.4 million. This figure does not include workers who have "workplaces" but no work to do and therefore do not receive wages. At the same time, workers who are allowed to get work in at most one month are not included. Furthermore, workers who work only one to fourteen hours a week and are actually unemployed are not included in this figure.

The actual number of unemployed people in the United States far exceeds the following statistics published by the authorities (in millions):

	Number of employed	Unemployed	"People unable to work"
December 1952	61.9		1.5		48.1
December 1953	60.8		1.8		49.5
Decrease Increase	Increase
	1.1		0.3		1.4

Thus, in one year, the number of employed people—including all those with independent income, and therefore not only wage laborers but also capitalists, numerous farmers, craftsmen, and small merchants—decreased by 1.1 million, while the number of unemployed people increased by only 300,000. Where did the remaining 800,000 go? Where did the millions of young people who are of working age and are expanding the ranks of job seekers every year go? The vast majority of them are hidden in the "people unable to work" category. The figure of over 2 million unemployed has become even more unfounded due to daily reports of new layoffs. Therefore, in February of this year, the American authorities had to admit that there were 3.7 million completely unemployed people. In reality, the number of fully unemployed people has reached about 6 million, and the number of partially unemployed people is even higher!

The defenders of American capitalism are loudly touting the unemployment benefits implemented a few years ago, which are intended to maintain the purchasing power of residents and thus alleviate the crisis. But this boasting does not stand up to scrutiny. Only about one-third of the unemployed can receive benefits, and only for a limited time: from 14 weeks to 26 weeks (depending on state regulations). Generally, the unemployed can only receive one-sixth to one-eighth of the wages they received when they were working, and the actual amount received is even less than this. If you calculate the expensive rent and other housing costs—gas, electricity, water, etc.—it is clear that relying on these benefits, the families of the unemployed can hardly make ends meet, let alone purchase industrial products.

The decline in the purchasing power of the working class is not only the result of large-scale unemployment; the income of employed workers has also been suppressed due to the cancellation of overtime work and, in many cases, the reduction of hourly wage quotas. The incomes of farmers, clerks, civil servants, and the general middle class have also decreased.

Due to the crisis, the situation of American working farmers has become unprecedentedly serious. Medium and small capitalists have also been hit by the crisis. The number of bankruptcies is constantly increasing: from 647 in January 1953 to 867 in January 1954; if calculated in terms of amount—it increased from $23 million to $30 million ("Business Week," March 1954). In addition, it must be estimated that larger enterprises never publicly declare their bankruptcy but usually allow themselves to be quietly acquired by monopoly capital.

× × ×

The U.S. government and experts from Wall Street monopolies are trying to convince people that the current temporary "recession" in the economy will pass quickly, and that a recovery seems to have begun or will begin in the near future.

This argument is unfounded. The following facts are sufficient to prove this:

1. The total amount of overproduced and accumulated goods in warehouses has so far been reduced by only 2 to 3 billion US dollars, which is negligible for the United States.

2. The decline in sales significantly exceeds the reduction in inventory.

3. In January 1954, the total value of new orders for American industry was $20.3 billion, a decrease of $4.2 billion from January 1953, or a decrease of 17 percent.

4. The total value of unfulfilled orders for the production of means of production decreased from $73 billion in January 1953 to $53 billion in January 1954, a decrease of 27 percent. This fact refutes the claim that investment this year is expected to decrease by only 4 percent compared to 1953. The problem is not only that these orders are constantly decreasing throughout the year, but also that the speed of their decrease is expanding month by month.

A basic question should be asked of American bourgeois economists:

"If business owners are reducing orders for the means of production month after month, and workers, clerks, and farmers have less and less purchasing power for means of subsistence due to reduced income, then how can we expect the crisis to end and 'trend towards recovery' in the near future?"

The economic crisis will naturally affect the domestic political situation in the United States and the foreign policy direction of the Washington ruling authorities. It is far from enough to rely on the materials published in newspapers to depict the political consequences of the American economic crisis to some extent, but some trends can still be affirmed.

The consequences of the crisis in domestic policy: on the one hand, the ruling monopolists are trying to strengthen the reactionary policies adopted to suppress all resistance to their anti-people plans; on the other hand, there is the growing mass protest against this reactionary policy of the ruling group. The American people's resistance to Washington's policies, which are entirely determined by the interests of monopoly capital, will inevitably strengthen. The further loss of prestige of this government, which only cares about the interests of tycoons—the working people are convinced of this—further promotes this resistance.

Everyone knows that President Eisenhower once stated that if the situation in the labor market has not changed in March, the government will take "firm measures." March did not bring any changes to the market situation. True, according to official materials, the number of unemployed only increased by 54,000. However, years of experience have shown that in March, due to the development of agriculture and construction work, the number of unemployed usually decreases by 5.5 percent, that is, by hundreds of thousands of people. From this point of view, the aforementioned situation in which the number of unemployed did not decrease is undoubtedly a sign of the deteriorating economic situation. However, when the president was asked at a press conference at the end of March how the government intended to cope with the further deepening of the crisis, he replied that the White House was holding discussion and consultation meetings on this issue every day, and that nothing had happened so far that required the emergency response plan to be implemented.

Obviously, there is no need to prove that no government measures can change the crisis trend determined by the laws of the capitalist economy. However, for the American working people, the government's utter inaction after making such high-sounding promises is an eloquent proof of the Washington regime's complete indifference to the interests of ordinary people. This makes the ruling Republican Party even more discredited and puts it in a more unfavorable situation in the congressional elections this autumn.

The Republicans came to power a year and a half ago after being in opposition for twenty years, and now they face the risk of losing the congressional elections. They do not know what campaign program to offer to voters who are afraid of the crisis. McCarthy's provocative actions against Republican leaders can also partially explain the Republican's difficult situation. The Republican leaders do not dare to restrain McCarthy because, in addition to unscrupulous anti-communist hysteria, they also have no campaign program.

Of course, from the perspective of the vital interests of the American working masses, it does not matter whether a majority of Republican or Democratic representatives appear in Congress. But for the party leaders and politicians of these parties, the outcome of the election is not irrelevant. In any case, observers of American political life cannot deny that the upcoming elections will reveal a huge increase in the population's dissatisfaction with the policies of the ruling group.

In the field of foreign policy, the impact of the developing crisis is no less complex and contradictory. On the one hand, under the attack of the crisis, the powerful aggressive groups in the United States are clearly inclined to go further down the road of foreign adventures in a more frenzied manner. On the other hand, the deterioration of the domestic economic situation will inevitably strengthen the masses' resistance to the most ambitious imperialist aggressive conspiracies.

Recent facts have proved that powerful monopoly capital groups and their representatives in the government and Congress are trying to clamor for launching new wars in order to find a way out of the crisis. Therefore, this aggressive policy has found full explanation in the speeches of the likes of Nolan and Nixon. Therefore, Dulles is presiding over a policy of undermining all possibilities for further easing international tensions. But this policy has become increasingly unpopular at home and has aroused growing opposition among the broadest strata of the American population. Not only workers, but also farmers, small business owners, clerks, and civil servants are burdened with increasingly heavy tax burdens while their incomes are decreasing. They say: What do Indochina or Taiwan have to do with us? Why should we pay high taxes to arm other countries? Why do we want a new war? Why should our sons shed blood at the other end of the world, and we still have to pay for military expenses? The crisis has strengthened the resistance of broad strata of the American people to war plans and military adventures. Among the masses, the desire for lasting peace is constantly consolidating, and hostility towards war preparations is constantly strengthening.

The economic crisis in the United States is undoubtedly one of the factors that weakens Washington's foreign policy position. It puts America's allies in the prospect of bringing the most serious consequences to their domestic economies. This is also one of the reasons for the failure (although not the main reason) of a series of diplomatic conspiracies by Dulles, who attempted to unite Britain and France to issue an "ultimatum" to China, to quickly realize the "internationalization" of the Indochina War, and to immediately establish a Southeast Asian military group. Britain, which is not yet engulfed by the economic crisis, feels more confident than its "old buddy" and is therefore now more inclined to pursue an independent policy.

Therefore, the economic crisis in the United States is bound to promote the further weakening of the position of American imperialism on the international stage.

    美国的经济危机
    苏联科学院院士  埃·瓦尔加
    在数目众多的美国经济研究机关中，有成千的经济学家和统计学家在工作。但是他们从来未能正确地预测经济周期的进程。每次生产过剩危机的开始，对他们说来，都是出乎意料之外，有如晴天霹雳。这些研究机关都拥有非常丰富的统计材料，尽管其中有伪造的，但仍然能够根据这些材料，对美国的经济情况作出比对任何其他资本主义国家更清晰的判断。
    问题在于：只有以唯一正确的、揭示资本主义发展的真正客观法则的科学理论，即以马克思—列宁主义的经济学说为基础，才能够正确地归纳与分析有关资本主义经济发展和运动的统计材料。只有以马克思—列宁主义为基础，才能够正确地预测当前的经济发展的进程。但是，马克思—列宁主义关于资本主义再生产的周期过程的学说，是和马克思—列宁主义关于资本主义一般生产方式的学说、关于这一生产方式的历史暂时性的学说、关于它的发展必然引起它的灭亡的客观法则的学说，有着密切的关系。
    资产阶级的“经济研究家”一点也不想知道资本主义经济发展的客观法则的存在，这是不足为奇的。他们认为，经济的发展和运动是由主观因素决定的。现代垄断资本的巨大威力把他们迷惑住了，他们无法了解：庞大的垄断资本的活动能够由某种客观法则来决定。因此，研究资本主义经济变化的资产阶级专家，从来也不能揭示这些变化的真正原因和性质。
    在一年前就可以看出，美国的经济危机已日益逼近。当时，消费品的产量已超过美国居民的购买力。鞋子、纺织品和其他劳动群众所需的消费品的产量已开始下降。但是资本家和他们雇佣的学者们丝毫也不愿意对此加以注意。
    虽然商品存货的不断增加，以明确的迹象表示美国已进入长期的生产过剩时期，但其他商品的产量，特别是生产资料的产量，仍继续上升。甚至当工业生产已越过最高峰时，商品积存的增加仍一直未曾停止过。根据美国联邦储备系统管理局的材料，旧工业生产指数在一九五三年三月份达到了最高水平；而以冲淡危机情况为目的所编制的新指数则于一九五三年七月份到达最高峰。利润仍然维持在高水平上，资本家不愿意紧缩生产。
    因此，到一九五三年年底时，工业、批发商业与零售商业中积压的货物已达八百二十亿美元。此外，政府手中的存货——小麦、棉花和其他农产品——约有七十到八十亿美元，政府购买这些商品的目的是为了大垄断资本家的利益而维持高昂的价格。陆、海、空军亦握有大量存货，不仅存有大量武器、装备和弹药，而且还拥有各种各样其他商品。美国陆军部副部长约翰逊在一次记者招待会上曾声称，仅地面部队即存有约三百五十亿美元的商品。例如，军队存有二千四百万枝铅笔！从约翰逊的声明中可以看出，军队从“有关系的”资本家那里用高价购买了本身并不需要的商品，然后又陆续把这些商品卖给其他的资本家，同样是卖给“有关系的”人们，而卖价只有原来买价的八分之一。
    到一九五三年年底时，私人和政府手中的存货差不多已等于美国全年的消费量。而且用赊卖和分期付款办法销售的消费品的数量已愈来愈大，即是说，指望消费者未来的收入，是算在他们未来的购买力的帐上。消费者的债务已达二百八十亿美元。生产过剩的危机已是不可避免的了。
    美国统治集团和他们的专家们力图否认危机的存在。一九五四年一月，艾森豪威尔总统在其致国会的咨文中宣称：
    “一九五三年年中在经济方面发生的不大的变动，看来很快就要停止。”
    甚至到现在，资产阶级的经济学家、资本家和右翼工会的领袖们还异口同声地硬说，并没有真正的危机，只有生产的“调整”和缓慢下降，不久就会有新的上升的。但是，这种说法是错误的，因为这次美国生产的下降，比过去历次所发生的现代美国经济危机——除了一九二九年的危机以外——都要厉害。下面是把所谓“季节性变动”估计在内的工业生产的新指数（以一九四七—一九四九年为一○○）：
    一九五三年　一九五四年
    七月　十月　十二月　一月　二月　三月
    一三七　一三二　一二六　一二五　一二三　一二三
    根据最后的统计材料，在目前这次危机的头七个月内，工业产量下降了百分之十点二。在前几次危机的头七个月内，根据当时的统计材料，生产下降的情况如下（百分数）：
  一九二○年　一九二九年　一九三七年　一九四八年
  九　二三　六　六
    仅一九二九年的危机在开始时有更剧烈的生产下降，但是在那次危机发展的后来的几个月，生产又有了临时性的上升：在危机的第九个月，生产一共只下降了百分之十三。虽然这些统计材料都不够精确，但仍然可以正确地表明总的趋势。
    虽然资本主义的生产过剩危机都是由于生产的社会性和占有的私人资本主义形式二者之间的矛盾所引起的，但是每一次危机都有其自己的特点。这些特点决定于：一，资本主义本身的变化、它的过渡到帝国主义和资本主义总危机阶段；二，这次经济周期的前一阶段的特点。
    根据这两点就可以确定现在的危机的某些特点：随通货膨胀而来的放贷资本的大量过剩；固定资本，特别是在因侵略朝鲜而迅速扩展的军事生产部门中的固定资本的大量过剩；军备竞赛和巨额的军事订货，这些订货使垄断资本得以继续保持高额利润，同时更加降低了居民的购买力。自然，要对现在发展中的危机的全部特点都一一加以确定，还为时过早。
    所谓现在并没有危机，只有轻微的生产衰退的说法，因垄断资本家目前几乎还没有感觉到危机的沉重而获得了有利的根据。虽然，整个说来，销售量是下降了。但是，在开始阶段，这还只限于非垄断资本的公司，或是较弱的垄断资本。例如，一年前，三个最大的汽车工业垄断资本：通用汽车公司、福特汽车公司、克莱斯勒公司的汽车产量，占全美国汽车总产量的百分之八十七，比较小的汽车公司的产品占百分之十三。现在，小汽车公司的产品仅占百分之四。
    垄断资本维持着高的产品价格，它们用取消那种需要付出高工资的加班工作，和降低小时工资定额的办法，来降低工人工资，并从原料价格的下降中牟取利润。今年，一些最大的垄断资本从被称为“八大财阀政府”的美国政府，以减免“超额利润”税和降低所得税的形式，将获得数十亿美元的“礼物”。其中的一些垄断资本--通用汽车公司、福特汽车公司、美国钢铁公司甚至还利用现有的大量低利贷款在危机时期扩大自己的生产能力。例如，美国钢铁公司于三月初就宣称将开始在美国建筑一座最大的高炉，每天可产铣铁一千三百五十吨。但是，较小的垄断资本和冶金公司一般都减少了对生产的新投资。
    垄断资本的利润仍维持着高度水平。此外，在近十年内，垄断资本已从它们的庞大利润中积蓄了巨额的公开的和隐藏的后备力量。它们的股票价格的稳定，小公司股票价格的急剧下落，原因就在这里。
    至于劳动人民，那么，危机依然使他们遭到重大打击。
    竭力用各种方法掩饰暗淡的现实的官方统计，还在一九五四年初就宣布失业人数是二百四十万人。这个数字不包括那些虽有“工作地点”，但却没有工作做、因而也得不到工资的工人在内。同时，那些被允许最迟在一个月内得到工作的工人，也未计算在内。而一些每周仅工作一到十四小时、实际上也等于失业的工人更未包括在这个数字中。
    美国失业者的实际人数，远超过官方发表的下列统计数字（以百万为单位）：
    就业人数　失业者“没有工作能力的人”
    一九五二年十二月　六一·九　一·五　四八·一
    一九五三年十二月　六○·八　一·八　四九·五
    减少　增加　增加
    一·一　○·三　一·四
    这样，在一年中，就业者--其中包括一切有独立收入的人，因而不仅有雇佣劳动者也包括资本家、人数众多的农民、手工业者和小商人等在内--就减少一百一十万人，而失业者的人数则仅增加三十万人。其余的八十万人到那里去了呢？那已达到劳动年龄、每年都在扩大寻觅工作者的队伍的上百万青年人又到那里去了呢？在这方面的绝大多数人都被隐没在“没有工作能力的人”这一栏中了。把失业人数确定为二百多万这一数字，已因每日都有对工人的新解雇的报道，而更加失掉根据。因此，今年二月美国当局不得不承认已有三百七十万完全失业者。实际上，完全失业者已达到六百万人左右，而半失业的人数则还要多些！
    美国资本主义的辩护人大吹大擂地炫耀几年前实行的对失业者的津贴，这种津贴是以维持居民的购买力，因而也是以缓和危机为目的。但是这种吹嘘经不起一驳。大约只有三分之一的失业者能得到津贴，而且还是在有限的时间内：由十四个星期到二十六个星期（各州规定不同）。一般失业者只能得到相当于他们有工作时所领工资的六分之一到八分之一，而实际领到的数字则比这还要少些。如果计算一下昂贵的房租和其它住屋费用--煤气、用电、自来水费等--那就可以清楚地看出，依靠这种津贴，失业者的家庭甚至难以糊口，更谈不到购买工业品了。
    工人阶级购买力的下降，不仅是由于大规模失业的结果；就业工人的收入，也因取消加班工作，和在许多场合下降低每小时的工资定额而被压低了。农民、职员、公务人员以及一般中等阶层的收入也都减少了。
    由于危机，美国劳动农民的处境空前严重起来。中、小资本家也已经受到危机的打击。破产者不断增加：由一九五三年一月的六百四十七家增加到一九五四年一月的八百六十七家；如果用金额计算--则是从两千三百万美元增加到三千万美元
  （“商业周刊”，一九五四年三月）。此外，还必须估计到，那些比较大的企业从不公开宣布自己的破产，而通常是不声不响地使自己为垄断资本所吞并。
    ×  ×  ×
    美国政府和华尔街垄断资本的专家们企图使人相信，目前经济的暂时“衰退”很快就会过去，好转似乎已经开始或在最近的将来就会开始。
    这种论断是毫无根据的。下面的事实就足以证明这一点：
    一、货栈里生产过剩的、积压的货物，到目前为止总共减少了二十亿至三十亿美元，而这个数目对美国说来是微不足道的。
    二、销售量的下降显著地超过了存货的减少。
    三、一九五四年一月美国工业新的订货总值为二百零三亿美元，较一九五三年一月减少四十二亿美元，即减少了百分之十七。
    四、生产资料生产方面未履行的订货的总值，从一九五三年一月的七百三十亿美元降低为一九五四年一月的五百三十亿美元，即下降了百分之二十七。这一事实驳倒了所谓今年的投资额预计较一九五三年只降低百分之四的说法。问题不仅是这些订货在整年中间不断减少，而且，其减少的速度还在逐月地扩大着。
    应该给美国的资产阶级经济学家提一个起码的问题：
    “如果企业主们对于生产资料的订货一月比一月减少，而工人、职员和农民由于收入减少以致对于生活资料的购买力也愈来愈小，那么，如何能在最近的将来期望危机结束和‘趋向好转’呢？”
    经济危机自然不能不影响到美国的内政情况和华盛顿执政当局的对外政策方针。要想多少描绘出美国经济危机的政治后果的图景，报刊发表的材料是远远不够的，然而，有些趋势还是能够肯定的。
    危机在对内政策方面所产生的后果：一方面，是当权的垄断资本家们力图加强为压制对其反人民计划的一切反抗而采取的反动方针；一方面，是对统治集团这一反动方针的群众性抗议的日益增长。美国人民群众对于完全由垄断资本的利益来决定的华盛顿的政策的反抗，不可避免地会要加强起来。这个只关心大亨们利益--劳动人民确信如此--的政府的进一步丧失威信，更加促进了这种反抗。
    大家都知道，艾森豪威尔总统曾经声言，如果在三月间劳动力市场的情况尚未改变，政府就要采取“坚决措施”。而三月份并未给市场情况带来任何变化。诚然，根据官方材料，失业人数只增加了五万四千人。但是，多年的经验证明，在三月间，由于农业和建设工作业已展开，失业者的数目通常要减少百分之五点五，即减少数十万人。由此看来，前面所说失业者并未减少的情况，无疑乃是经济情况恶化的征象。但是，当三月底人们在记者招待会上询问总统，政府打算怎样应付危机进一步加深的情况时，他回答说，白宫天天都在举行关于这一问题的讨论会和谘询会，目前还没有发生任何情况，使应付紧急状态的计划必须付诸实施。
    显然无须证明，无论什么样的政府的措施，对于改变由资本主义经济法则所决定的危机潮流，都是无能为力的。但是，对于美国劳动人民说来，政府在发表这样冠冕堂皇的诺言之后所表现的丝毫无所作为，乃是华盛顿政权对普通人的利益毫不关心的雄辩的证明。这就使得执政的共和党更加威信扫地，并使它在今年秋天的国会选举中所处的情况更加不利。
    共和党人是于在野二十年之后在一年半以前执政的，而现在他们又面临着在国会选举中失败的危险。他们不知道该向害怕危机的选民们提出什么样的竞选纲领。麦卡锡对共和党领袖们的挑衅行动也可以部分地说明共和党人处境的困难。共和党的头子们不敢对麦卡锡加以约束，因为他们除了肆无忌惮的反共产主义的歇斯底里以外，也是没有任何竞选纲领的。
    当然，从美国劳动群众的切身利益的观点说来，不论在国会中将出现共和党代表或者是民主党代表的多数，都是没有什么意义的。但是对于这些政党的党魁和政客们说来，选举的结局并不是无关紧要的。无论如何，美国政治生活的观察家们不能否认即将到来的选举将显露出居民对统治集团政策的不满情绪的巨大增长。
    在对外政策的领域内，发展着的危机的影响所及，其复杂性和矛盾并不更缓和些。一方面，在危机的袭击下，美国有势力的侵略集团显然倾向于进一步疯狂地走上对外冒险的道路。另一方面，国内经济形势的恶化也必不可免地会加强群众对于最野心勃勃的帝国主义侵略阴谋的反抗。
    最近的事实证明，有势力的垄断资本集团和他们在政府和国会内的代表力图为了从危机中寻找出路而叫嚣发动新的战争。因此，这种侵略政策就在诺兰、尼克松之流的演说中找到了充分的说明。因此，杜勒斯正主持着破坏国际紧张局势进一步缓和的一切可能性的政策。但是这种政策在国内已愈来愈不得人心，而在美国居民最广泛的阶层中引起日益增长的反对情绪。不仅工人，而且农民、小商人、职员、公务员，都在收入减少的情况下又负荷了日益加重的捐税负担，他们说：印度支那或是台湾与我们有何相干呢？为什么我们应该为了武装别的国家而支付高额捐税呢？为什么我们要新的战争？为什么我们的儿子应该在世界的另一端流血，而我们还必须支付军事费用呢？危机加强了美国广泛阶层对战争计划和军事冒险的反抗。在居民群众中间，要求持久和平的愿望正在不断巩固，而对于战争准备的敌视也在不断加强。
    美国的经济危机无疑地也是使华盛顿对外政策地位削弱的因素之一。它把美国的盟国置于给他们本国经济带来最严重后果的前景之下。这也就是杜勒斯企图联合英、法向中国提出“最后通谍”，以迅速实现印度支那战争“国际化”的计划，并立即建立东南亚军事集团的一系列外交阴谋的失败原因之一
  （虽然不是主要的原因）。英国目前还没有被经济危机所笼罩，感觉到自己比“老伙计”更具信心，因而现在也就更加倾向于奉行独立的政策。
    因此，美国的经济危机势将促使美国帝国主义在国际舞台上的地位的进一步削弱。
