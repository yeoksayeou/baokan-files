    Guaranteeing Uninterrupted Long-Distance Telecommunication Lines
    —Introducing Xu Xingzhu's Long-Distance Line Maintenance Method
    By Our Reporter, Fu Dong

When you make a long-distance call to comrades or relatives far away, you will be extremely anxious if there is a buzzing sound in the phone, or if the call is suddenly cut off while you are talking. Or, if you have an urgent matter that requires sending a telegram to another location, but you cannot send it temporarily due to a line fault, you will be even more worried.

Xu Xingzhu, a long-distance lineman, knows very well how important telephones and telegrams are to people's lives, so he works conscientiously and responsibly, using his mind to create a set of methods for maintaining long-distance lines.

In December 1949, the Beijing-Shenyang main line had already been restored. The director of the Suizhong County Post and Telecommunications Bureau in western Liaoning said at a meeting to the linemen:

  "In order to ensure the smooth flow of major trunk lines, we will implement the Soviet advanced cable system. It is best for linemen to go to the line section." When he asked everyone to express their attitude, the linemen remained silent for a long time. Xu Xingzhu understood that it didn't matter if he was alone in the wilderness, but a problem with the line was no joke. He also recalled the various scenes on the line: the endless grassland, the telephone poles more than twenty meters high, and the stormy nights. He asked himself, "Can I be intimidated by these difficulties?" At this moment, he suddenly remembered a story told to him by the Party branch secretary: In 1948, the Northeast was almost completely liberated, but the Kuomintang bandits were still stubbornly resisting and harassing everywhere. Comrades fighting in the Suizhong guerrilla area had to send messages to neighboring areas, which required passing through enemy-occupied areas. When crossing the river, they couldn't even find a boat. If they were discovered by the enemy, they would be shot to death. Although the environment was difficult at that time, the comrades all competed to send messages. At night, they found a dustpan at a farmer's house, sat in it, and used a large wooden pole to push themselves across the river little by little. Once, the dustpan overturned, and a comrade fell into the river, almost losing his life. He also remembered the Party branch secretary's speech at a meeting: "Models should act as the locomotive, going wherever they are needed." Thinking about this, he suddenly stood up and said, "I am willing to go to the line section."

Not long after Xu Xingzhu arrived at the line section, one night, a rainstorm suddenly arose, and it seemed like the sky was about to collapse. He couldn't settle down to sleep. In the middle of the night, the equipment station test bench called, saying that there was a problem with the line and that it had to be repaired immediately. After hearing the call, he grabbed his tools and ran. Because he was anxious, he fell into the water when crossing a small river. The river water rose minute by minute, and it took a lot of effort for him to climb out of the ditch. Another night, a strong wind blew from the Bohai Bay, causing trees on the road to fall or break. Although Lao Xu was wearing glasses, he couldn't open his eyes; when crossing an iron bridge, the wind was so strong that he had to crawl forward step by step. Such days were not uncommon, and he began to wonder: "How can I prevent line failures?"

One day, as he was walking through the fields, he noticed that the sorghum in some fields grew as thick as small trees, with grains as large as beans, while the wheat in the field next to it was as thin as incense sticks. "What's going on? Same land, growing two different crops?" After careful observation, he realized that the green field was often plowed and hoed, while in the sparse wheat field, there wasn't a single person to be seen. This gave him an inspiration: if he could go to the line every day like the villagers tilling the fields, then the line would not fail in bad weather. He decided to do this, and in two and a half months, he inspected and repaired all 544 utility poles one by one.

The effect was really good. For nearly half a year, he didn't encounter too much trouble. At night, no matter how strong the wind or how heavy the rain, he could sleep peacefully in his house.

The following spring, Lao Xu climbed up the pole and saw that there were new changes: some wires were long, some were short, and they often tangled together when the wind blew. What was the reason? He kept thinking about it, and realized that it was because the quality of the wires was different. After expanding and contracting in summer and winter, their lengths became different in the spring. Therefore, he thought that it was not enough to just inspect and repair the poles one by one; some work had to be done seasonally.

Xu Xingzhu's work became organized, with everything in order. But unexpected things happened again. Once, due to excessive rainfall, the river water rose sharply and washed down several telephone poles on the river, and even more guy wires were broken. He thought that river poles, test poles, and branch poles crossing railway poles often encountered accidents and should be given special attention. In addition to regular inspections and regular patrols, there should also be special patrols.

Now, the calls on the line were much clearer, but there were still occasional buzzing noises. He inspected for a long time before figuring out the reason: it turned out that when the villagers plowed the fields, they often carelessly bumped the utility poles, causing them to shake; when the wind blew, the sorghum ears hit the wires and shook them; sometimes, naughty cowherds let the cattle scratch themselves on the utility poles, causing the poles to vibrate; and when elementary school students went home after school, some people often threw stones at the insulators on the poles as a game. From then on, Xu Xingzhu gained an experience: it was not enough to maintain the line by himself; he had to rely on everyone to protect it. Later, he often took advantage of the farmers resting in the shade of trees at noon, or when the village held meetings, to conduct propaganda among the masses; he also often visited teachers at schools and asked them to educate students to protect the lines. When he encountered cowherds who were not taking good care of their cattle, he would talk to them about stories of protecting public property to educate them. In addition, he also maintained close contact with the communication workers and road maintenance workers of the railway, in order to obtain their help.

Xu Xingzhu has grown crops and knows how to protect them. When patrolling or maintaining the lines, he always went around them; when adding soil, he didn't take soil from the villagers' fields casually. The villagers in the two or thirty villages along the line all reflected: Lao Xu runs on the lines all day long, without wasting a single crop. There is really nothing to say. Over time, the villagers protected the utility poles as if they were their own crops. They took the initiative to tie up the sorghum close to the lines with ropes so that they wouldn't touch the wires. When the district called for organizing protective groups, they all enthusiastically participated.

Xu Xingzhu deeply realized that some tasks are difficult to do alone. For example, when adjusting the sag of the wires, sometimes one has to go up and down several times. If there are two people, it would be much easier: one person tightens the wire on the pole, and the other person watches below. In June 1951, the line maintenance team was established, and things became easier. When something happened, everyone could gather together and help each other. Once, a river suddenly changed its course, and the utility poles not far from the river were about to be submerged. He and several team members started repairing them. Before the river water flowed over, the water barrier stakes were already in place, and many poles and rusty wires were replaced.

A long-distance line is a whole. If this section is not obstructed, but something happens in another section, the line is still not connected. He has an even deeper understanding of this. Therefore, no matter which section has a problem, he cares about it equally. One winter night in 1951, there was an accident on the line. He went to check and repair it across sections, and accidentally fell into an ice hole, and his whole body was wet; he felt a needle-like pain. But he continued to check forward and finally found the location of the obstruction.

The long-distance lines maintained by Xu Xingzhu had no failures for two and a half years, ensuring the smooth flow of telegrams and telephones, greatly improving the quality of long-distance lines, and saving the state a lot of overhaul costs. Because of his love for the people's cause, he has been rated as a labor model several times, and in January 1953, he was promoted to deputy director of the Jinzhou Long-Distance Central Station.

Recently, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central Government and the National Postal and Telecommunications Trade Union held a meeting to promote Xu Xingzhu's long-distance line maintenance method.

    保证长途电信线路不发生障碍
    ——介绍许兴柱长途线路维护工作法
    本报记者  傅冬
    当你给远方的同志、亲友打长途电话时，如果电话里有嗡嗡的响声，或者正当你和对方通话时电话忽然断了，你一定会心焦得不得了。或者，你有件紧急的事情，需要给别处发个电报，但因线路发生故障一时发不出去，你更会着急起来。
    电话、电报对人民生活是如何的重要，长途线务员许兴柱是知道得清清楚楚的，所以他工作认真、负责，用心思创造出一套维护长途线路的工作法。
    一九四九年十二月，京、沈干线已经恢复。辽西绥中县邮电局局长在一次会上对线务员们说：
  “为了保证主要干线的畅通，实行苏联的先进包线制，线务员最好到段上去。”他要求大家表示态度时，线务员们半天不啃声。许兴柱心里明白，在荒地里孤单单地一个人倒没啥关系，线路有了个三长两短可不是闹着玩的。他还想起了线路上的种种景象：那一望无际的草塘，那二十多公尺高的飞线杆，那狂风骤雨的夜晚。他问自己：“我能被这些困难吓倒吗？”这时，他突然忆起党支部书记给他讲的一个故事：一九四八年，东北已快全部解放，但国民党匪帮还在顽抗，到处骚扰。在绥中游击区作战的同志，要送信给邻区，必须通过敌占区，过河的时候，连条船都找不到，如果被敌人发觉了，就有被乱枪射死的危险。那时环境虽然困难，但同志们都争着要去送信。夜里，他们到老乡家找个簸箩，坐在里面，用根大木杆支着一点一点划过河去。有一次簸箩翻了，一位同志掉到河里，差点把命送了。他又想起支部书记在一个会上的讲话：“模范要起火车头的作用，那里需要，就到那里工作去。”想着想着，他猛地站起来说：“我愿到段上去。”
    许兴柱到了段上没多久，一天夜里，忽然起了暴风雨，天好像要塌下来一样。他怎么也安不下心来睡觉。半夜里，机务站试验台来了电话，说线路发生了毛病，得马上去修。他听完话，拿了工具就跑。因为心里着急，过小河沟时，掉到水里。河水一分钟一分钟地往上涨，费了好大的力气，他才从沟里爬上来。另一个夜里，大风从渤海湾里吹来，把路上的树吹的倒的倒，断的断。老许虽然带着眼镜走，还是没法睁开眼；过一座铁桥时，风刮得那么凶，他只好一步一步地往前爬了。这样的日子不算少，他开始心里琢磨：“怎样才能使线路不出障碍？”
    有一天，他打田野里走过时，发现有的地里的高粱长得就像颗小树般粗，米粒有豆子般大，而旁边一块地里的麦子却像根香似的细。“这是怎么回事？一样的地，长着两样庄稼？”他仔细观察了一番，原来那绿油油的地里经常有人在刨、在锄，而那黄稀稀的麦地里，却压根看不见个人影。这给了他一个启示：如果能像老乡天天上地里耕田一样，天天到线路上去，那线路就不会在坏天气里发生毛病了。他决定这样做，在两个半月的时间内，他把五百四十四根电杆逐一检修了一遍。
    效果真是不错，在将近半年的日子里，没有遇到太大的麻烦。夜里，风再刮得大，雨再下得大，他都能安心地在屋里睡觉。
    第二年春天，老许爬到杆上一看，情况有了新的变化：电线有的长，有的短，刮风时，常常绞在一起。原因在那里呢？他不断地寻思着，原来是由于线条的质量不同，在夏天和冬天经过一胀一缩，到春天它的长短就不一样了。因此，他想光是用逐杆检修的办法是不行的，有些工作还得按季节进行才行。
    许兴柱的工作有了头绪，样样有条有理。可是意想不到的事情又发生了。有一次因雨下得过大，河水猛涨，一下子冲倒了好几根河上电杆，拉线坏的更多。他一想，河上杆、试线杆、分线杆跨越铁道杆等，常发生意外，应该予以特殊照顾，除定期检修定期巡回，还得加一条：特殊巡回。
    现在，线路上通话时是清楚多了，但是偶然还有嗡嗡的杂音。他检查了很久，才把原因弄清楚：原来老乡犁地时，常因不留心，把电杆碰得乱晃；刮风时，高粱穗打得电线直摇摆；有时，放牛娃贪玩，让牛到电杆上搔痒，振得电杆发响；小学生放学回家时，常有人用石子打电杆上的磁瓶作游戏。从此，许兴柱得到一个经验：光靠自己维护线路是不成的，须依靠大伙来爱护。以后他常常趁中午农民在树荫下歇凉，或村里开会时，向群众进行宣传；他还常到学校访问教师，请他们教育学生爱护线路。碰到放牛娃不好好放牛时，就和他谈些爱护公共财产的故事，来教育他。此外，他还和铁路的通讯工区、养路工区的工人密切联系，以便取得对方的帮助。
    许兴柱种过庄稼，知道应该怎样爱护庄稼。巡回或维修线路时，他总是绕着道儿走；培土的时候，不随便从老乡的地里取土。沿线二、三十个村庄的老乡都这样反映：老许成天在线路上跑，一颗庄稼也不糟蹋，真是没啥说的。天长日久了，老乡们也像爱护自己的庄稼一样爱护电杆。他们主动地把挨着线条的高粱，用绳子绑扎起来，使它们碰不到线。区里号召组织起来成立护线组时，他们都踊跃参加。
    许兴柱深深体会到：有些活一个人干是吃力的。比如，一个人调整线条的垂度时，有时得上上下下好几趟，假如有两个人就省事多了，一个人在电杆上紧线，一个人在下面看。一九五一年六月成立了包线组，事情就好办了。有了事情，大家可以集中在一块，互相帮助。一次，有一条河道突然改道了，离河道不远的电杆眼看就要被水淹没。他就和几个组员动手修起来了。赶河水流过来，水围桩已经打好，还更换了不少电杆和发锈的线。
    长途线路是一个整体，这段不出障碍，别段出了事，线路还是不通。对于这一点，他体会得更是深刻。因此，不管那一段出了事，他都同样关心。一九五一年冬天的一个夜里，线路出事故了。他便越段去查修，一个不小心，掉进一个冰窟窿里，全身都湿了；他感到针扎一样的疼痛。但他继续往前查，终于找到了障碍的所在。
    许兴柱维护的长途线路，两年半的时间内没有发生过障碍，保证了电报、电话的畅通，大大提高了长途线路质量，并为国家节省了大修费用。由于他对人民事业的热爱，曾几次被评为劳动模范，一九五三年一月又被提升为锦州长途中心站的副站长。
    最近，中央邮电部和全国邮电工会召开会议，推广了许兴柱的长途线路维护工作法。
