Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 18th—The French National Assembly passed a motion on the 17th authorizing Radical Socialist Pierre Mendès France to form a new government, with 419 votes in favor. In his speech to the National Assembly requesting authorization, Mendès France clarified the policies of the new government. Regarding the Indochina issue, he said: a ceasefire in Indochina must be achieved quickly, and the incoming government is prepared to resign if it cannot secure a ceasefire within four weeks. However, Mendès France also said that "France will continue to maintain its presence in the Far East" and will "take all military measures to cope with current needs." Regarding the European issue, Mendès France stated that France will continue to pursue a policy of not leaving the North Atlantic bloc. He said that France must make its attitude towards the "European Army" clear to the West, and his government will organize a broad debate. Mendès France called on all parties to reach an agreement on the "European Army" issue. On the North African issue, he advocated ensuring France's position in North Africa. On the issue of domestic economic policy, Mendès France stated that he would implement austerity measures and continue to implement the so-called "18-Month Revival Plan" of the previous government.

Communist Party member Pi Yu made a speech during the National Assembly debate. He said that Mendès France's willingness to achieve peace in Indochina within four weeks shows a change from the words of previous governments. Therefore, the Communist Party will vote in favor of his authorization in order to provide the government with a way to achieve peace in Indochina.

According to Reuters, after Mendès France obtained authorization from the National Assembly, he prepared to submit the list of the new cabinet to President Coty on the 19th. Bidault's Popular Republican Movement announced that they would not participate in the new government.
