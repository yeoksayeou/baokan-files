    People's Congresses and People's Governments of Various Districts in Lüda City
    Actively Implement the Policy of Serving Industrial Production

    After the general election, the urban district People's Congresses and People's Governments directly under Lüda City have actively implemented the policy of serving industrial production. Each industrial district generally convened its first district People's Congress in late April. The congresses in each district all discussed mobilizing workers to learn from Wang Chonglun's spirit of production innovation and deeply developing labor emulation as one of the important topics, and made resolutions to implement it. After the meetings, labor emulation in many factories was further deepened. Shortly after the Gan Jingzi District convened its People's Congress, Ju Yuanzhen, a people's representative from the Dalian Alkali Plant, helped bricklayers create a small concrete mixer, which increased production efficiency six times and saved more than 200 man-days per month. Under his leadership, workers at the Dalian Alkali Plant are currently launching a competition to tackle production problems. The factory leadership has put forward more than 50 key production issues, and the workers have put forward the slogan "Solve key problems and implement the resolutions of the People's Congress," submitting dozens of technical innovation proposals to solve these key problems within a month. Jiang Zhongfa, a fitter in the machine shop, and others proposed a new method of drilling holes in a component, which increased production efficiency eight times and ensured 100% quality. In implementing the resolutions of the People's Congress, workers at the Dalian Dyestuff Plant in Zhongshan District also put forward many rationalization proposals. The factory's employees previously submitted an average of about 100 rationalization proposals per month, which rapidly increased to more than 200 in the first half of May, many of which were technical innovation proposals. Kang Juyuan, an engineer and people's representative at this factory, also mobilized technicians to go deep into the workshops to help workers solve key problems. Recently, they solved the long-standing technical obstacle of the non-compliant quality standard of vulcanized blue, improving the quality of vulcanized blue.

    The People's Congresses of many districts in Lüda City have also discussed and resolved issues such as improving transportation, culture, education and health, commodity supply, worker family work, and adjusting housing, based on the needs of factories and mines, to ensure the normal operation of factory production in all aspects. Based on the continuous increase in population and the shortage of worker housing, the Zhongshan District, in a resolution of its first People's Congress, called on people from all walks of life to actively conserve housing and vigorously carry out housing repair work. The entire district plans to save 700 surplus rooms and give priority to allocating them to workers. In order to earnestly implement the resolutions of the People's Congress on serving industrial production, the Shahekou District People's Government recently established a public works construction section, responsible for timely repairing and maintaining roads, bridges, and other works to ensure smooth transportation within the district. In order to ensure that factory workers can regularly eat fresh vegetables, the Gan Jingzi District also mobilized many suburban vegetable production cooperatives to directly sign supply contracts with factory catering units. In addition, each district also paid attention to the work of workers' families, strengthened the unity of workers' families, and ensured the improvement of employee attendance rates.

    旅大市各区人民代表大会和区人民政府
    积极贯彻为工业生产服务的方针
    普选后的旅大市直属各城市区人民代表大会和区人民政府积极贯彻了为工业生产服务的方针。各工业区在今年四月下旬普遍召开了第一次区人民代表大会。各区的大会都以动员工人学习王崇伦的生产革新精神、深入开展劳动竞赛为重要议题之一进行讨论，并作出决议来贯彻。会后，许多工厂的劳动竞赛进一步深入展开。甘井子区在召开了人民代表大会以后不久，大连碱厂人民代表鞠远振就帮助瓦工创造了小型混凝土搅拌机，生产效率比前提高了六倍，每月还可以节约二百多个人工。在他的带动下，大连碱厂工人目前正掀起一个抢生产课题的竞赛，工厂领导方面提出了五十多件生产关键问题，工人们提出了“解决关键问题，贯彻人民代表大会决议”的口号，在一个月内已提出数十件解决这些关键问题的技术革新建议。机械车间钳工姜忠发等提出了在一种部件上钻眼的新方法，提高了生产效率八倍，而且保证了质量百分之百合格。中山区大连染料厂的工人在贯彻人民代表大会的决议中，也提出很多合理化建议。这个厂的职工以往每个月平均提出合理化建议一百件左右，在五月上半月迅速增加到二百多件，其中有不少属于技术革新的建议。这个工厂的工程师、人民代表康聚元还发动技术人员深入车间帮助工人解决关键问题，最近解决了长时间存在的硫化青质量不合乎规定标准的技术障碍，使硫化青的质量得到提高。
    旅大市许多区人民代表大会还根据厂矿的需要，讨论解决了改进交通运输、文教卫生、商品供应、工属工作以及调整住房等问题，以便从各方面保证工厂生产的正常进行。中山区根据人口不断增加和职工住房不足的情况，在第一次人民代表大会的决议中，号召各界人民积极节约用房并大力进行房屋补修工作。全区计划节约出多余用房七百间，优先拨给职工居住。沙河口区人民政府为了认真贯彻人民代表大会关于为工业生产服务的决议，最近专门成立了公用建设科，负责及时修补和护养马路、桥梁等工作，保证区内运输的畅通。甘井子区为了保证工厂工人经常吃到新鲜的蔬菜，还发动许多郊区蔬菜生产合作社直接和工厂伙食单位签订了供应合同。另外，各区也注意了工人家属的工作，加强了工人家属的团结，保证了职工出勤率的提高。
