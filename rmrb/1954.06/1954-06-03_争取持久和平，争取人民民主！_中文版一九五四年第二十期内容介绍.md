    The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" No. 20, 1954, has been published.

    This issue publishes an editorial entitled "Carry out Combative and Effective Political Agitation Work." The editorial points out: The mass agitation work of the Communist and Workers' Parties is one of the most powerful weapons for the political education of the working people. The invincible theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are the solid ideological foundation of political agitation. High ideological content, realism, truthfulness, and conciseness are indispensable characteristics in the mass agitation work of communists. In the current international situation, the tasks facing the Communist and Workers' Parties are extremely complex and important, which urgently requires the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries to strengthen political agitation work and improve its level by all means. In people's democratic countries, the main task of political agitation is to tirelessly cultivate the working people's sense of responsibility to society and their socialist attitude towards labor and public property, so that they can strive for new achievements in building socialism and improving the people's welfare, and closely integrate these tasks with the struggle for peace. When communists in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries carry out political agitation, they must closely integrate the struggle of the people of all countries for peace, freedom, national independence, and democratic rights with the struggle for the realization of the immediate demands of the working people. The editorial concludes: Political agitation work is an important part of the Party's overall work. Strengthening political agitation work and improving its ideological content can further strengthen the Party's influence and connection with the masses of the people, and enable them to play a greater role in the struggle for lasting peace and the immediate interests of the people of all countries.

    Important articles published in this issue include "China's Achievements in Solving the Nationalities Question" by Wang Feng, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, "Some Achievements of the Local Party Congresses of the Italian Communist Party" by Pietro Secchia, Deputy General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, and "Polish Science Serves the People" by Zolkiewski, Member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party.

    Secchia's article summarizes the situation and achievements of the Italian Communist Party in holding representative conferences in most provinces. The article emphasizes: The local party congresses show that at present, not only the main cadres of the party, but also all party members have realized the tasks of the working class and the Communist Party and their role in the country. Our party is not only politically stronger, not only increased in number, but also improved in quality. The development of our party requires us to conduct political education for all party members. Our party has the responsibility to safeguard the immediate interests of the working people and to conduct political education for them. We must unite all working people and all democratic forces, expand the scale of their struggle, and give them the confidence to win.

    Zolkiewski's article summarizes the development and achievements of people's Poland in science. The article emphasizes: The current task of Polish science is to serve the people engaged in socialist construction. In order to complete this general task, theory must be more closely linked to practice, and to do this, scientific workers must learn the Marxist method of cognition and concentrate all their efforts on solving the most urgent problems of particular importance to the development of the national economy and national culture. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically organize scientific work and implement the method of collective scientific research. The bourgeois ideas and bourgeois traditional methods that still exist and hinder scientific development must be overcome. Through struggle, it is necessary to enable Polish scientific workers to establish a truly scientific worldview. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第二十期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第二十期已经出版。
    本期以“开展战斗性的有效的政治鼓动工作”为题发表社论。社论指出：共产党和工人党的群众鼓动工作是对劳动人民进行政治教育的最有力的武器之一。马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的战无不胜的学说是政治鼓动的坚固的思想基础。高度的思想性、现实性、真实性和简洁性，这些就是共产主义者的群众鼓动工作中不可缺少的特点。在目前的国际形势下，摆在共产党和工人党面前的任务是极端复杂和重大的，这就迫切地要求各国共产党和工人党用一切办法加强政治鼓动工作并提高这一工作的水平。在人民民主国家里，政治鼓动的主要任务是不倦地培养劳动人民对社会的责任感及对劳动和公共财产的社会主义态度，使他们在建设社会主义和增进人民的福利方面努力取得新的成就，并且把这些任务和争取和平的斗争密切结合起来。资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国的共产主义者在进行政治鼓动的时候，要把各国人民争取和平、自由、民族独立和民主权利的斗争跟争取实现劳动人民切身要求的斗争密切结合起来。社论最后说：政治鼓动工作是党的整个工作的重要的组成部分。加强政治鼓动工作和提高它的思想性，就能够进一步加强党对人民群众的影响和与群众的联系，并使它们在争取持久和平和各国人民的切身利益的斗争中发挥更大的效力。
    本期刊载的重要文章有中华人民共和国中央人民政府民族事务委员会副主任委员汪锋的“中国在解决民族问题上的成就”，意大利共产党副总书记彼·谢嘉的“意大利共产党地方党代表会议的一些成绩”，波兰统一工人党中央委员佐基夫斯基的 “波兰科学为人民服务”。
    谢嘉的文章综述了意大利共产党在大多数省份举行代表会议的情况和成绩。文章着重说：各地党代表会议表明在目前不仅党的主要干部，而且全体党员都已经认识到工人阶级和共产党的任务及其在全国的作用。我们的党不仅在政治上更加强大了，不仅在数量上增加了，而且在质的方面也提高了。我们党的发展情况要求我们对全体党员进行政治教育。我们党有责任维护劳动人民的切身利益并对他们进行政治教育。我们必须团结全体劳动人民和一切民主力量，扩大他们的斗争规模，使他们具有胜利的信心。
    佐基夫斯基的文章综述了人民波兰在科学方面的发展和成就。文章着重指出：波兰科学当前的任务就是为从事社会主义建设的人民服务。为了完成这个总任务，必须使理论更密切地联系实际，而要做到这一点，科学工作者必须学会马克思主义的认识方法，集中一切力量解决对发展国民经济和民族文化有特殊重要意义的、最迫切的问题。因此也就必须有系统地组织科学工作，实行集体的科学研究工作的方法。目前还存在的、阻碍科学发展的资产阶级思想和资产阶级的传统方法必须克服。必须通过斗争，使得波兰的科学工作者建立真正科学的世界观。（新华社）
