Farmers in Rehe Province have established seven cooperatives similar to the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, which is a result of their learning from the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative. In February of last year, the Rehe Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Government organized a delegation of forty-five people to visit the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Xigou Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, to learn from their experience in developing mountain production. After the delegation returned, they conducted communication and publicity throughout the province, organizing farmers in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams to learn from the advanced experience of the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative. Farmers in Chengde, Pingquan, Longhua, Qinglong, and other counties in Rehe Province, where there are many mountains, are adopting the experience of the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative to develop mountain production. After hearing the report on the experience of the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative at the People's Representative Conference of Chengde County, Ding Wenzhong, a farmer in Gushan Village, Chengde County, voluntarily turned his mountain land into contour terraces and planted fruit trees and locust trees. The Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Zhangjiaying Village, Pingquan County, learned from the experience of the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, transforming mountain slopes into terraces, planting dense young forests, and raising sheep. The villagers are full of confidence and are determined to transform barren mountains into orchards and pastures, and wasteland into fertile fields.

    热河省山地较多的承德、平泉、隆化、青龙等县农民
    学习李顺达生产合作社先进经验建设山区
    热河省已经出现了七个和李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社同样的社，这是山区农民学习李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社的结果。去年二月间，中共热河省委员会和省人民政府曾组织了一个四十五个人的参观团，到山西省平顺县西沟村李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社参观、学习发展山区生产的经验。参观团回来后，在全省范围内进行了传达和宣传，组织农业生产合作社和互助组农民学习李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社的先进经验。热河省山地较多的承德、平泉、隆化、青龙等县的农民，都采用李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社的经验来发展山区的生产。承德县孤山村农民丁文仲在县各界人民代表会议上听了传达李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社的经验报告后，主动把自己的山地修成了等高式的梯田，栽上了果树和槐树。平泉县张家营村的农林畜牧生产合作社，学习李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社的经验，将山坡修成梯田，栽植了密密层层的幼林，并饲养了羊群。全村农民充满着信心，要把秃山改变为果园和牧场，把荒地变成良田。
