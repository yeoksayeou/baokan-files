Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 27th: Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China delivered a radio address on All India Radio at 10:45 PM on the 27th. The full text is as follows:

	I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address the Indian people. Please allow me first to pay tribute to the great Indian people in the name of the great Chinese people.

	Since ancient times, there has been a deep friendship between the Chinese and Indian people. A border of nearly three thousand kilometers links China and India together. Century after century, history records peaceful cultural exchanges and economic exchanges between our two countries, but never records wars and hatred.

	In modern times, both China and India have suffered from foreign colonialism's aggression and oppression, but the Chinese and Indian people have never ceased their struggles for freedom and independence. The pain suffered for the same reasons and the struggles carried out for the same goals have deepened the sympathy and understanding between the Chinese and Indian people.

	After the founding of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India, the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Indian people, nurtured by history, has developed anew.

	We have both established our own new countries. Our common desire is to build our respective great motherlands in a peaceful environment. This common desire constitutes the basis for further developing the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people.

	We value this friendship. Because friendship generates strength. When peace in Asia is currently suffering from external threats, the friendship between the 960 million people of China and India is a major force in maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

	Not long ago, our two countries signed an agreement on trade and communication between the Tibet region of China and India. In this agreement, the two governments declared that the principles of mutual treatment are: mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. This agreement, formulated in accordance with these principles, provides a good example of resolving issues through consultation in international relations. Prime Minister Nehru said yesterday: "If these principles can be recognized in a wider scope, then the fear of war can disappear, and the spirit of cooperation can develop." During my visit to India and my talks with Prime Minister Nehru, both Prime Minister Nehru and I believed that these principles should be implemented in today's Asian and world international relations.

	I firmly believe that the joint efforts of China and India will make a significant contribution to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

	Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people!
	Long live Asian peace!
	Long live world peace!

    周总理向印度人民发表广播演说
      【新华社新德里二十七日电】中华人民共和国中央人民政府政务院总理周恩来在二十七日晚十时四十五分在全印广播电台发表广播演说。全文如下：
    我很高兴获有机会向印度人民致词。请首先允许我以伟大的中国人民的名义向伟大的印度人民致敬。
    从远古以来，在中国人民和印度人民之间就有了深厚的友谊。将近三千公里的边界把中国和印度联结在一起。一个世纪又一个世纪，在我们两国之间，历史记录了和平的文化交流和经济来往，但是从来没有记录过战争和仇恨。
    近代以来，中国和印度同样受到了外国殖民主义的侵略和压迫，但是中国人民和印度人民从来没有停止过为自由和独立而进行的斗争。由于同样的原因而受到的痛苦，为了同样的目的而进行的斗争，都加深了中印两国人民之间的同情和了解。
    在中华人民共和国和印度共和国成立以后，由历史所培育了的中印两国人民间的传统友谊又有了新的发展。
    我们都已经建立了自己的新的国家。我们共同的愿望，就是要在和平环境中建设各自的伟大的祖国。这种共同的愿望，构成了进一步发展中印两国人民间的友谊的基础。
  我们重视这种友谊。因为，友谊产生力量。当亚洲的和平目前还在遭受着外来威胁的时候，中国和印度九万万六千万人民的友谊是维护亚洲及世界和平的重大力量。
    不久以前，我们两国签订了一个关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定。在这个协定中，两国政府申明彼此对待的原则是：互相尊重领土主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互惠，和平共处。依据这些原则制定的这个协定，提供了国际间以协商方式解决问题的一个良好范例。尼赫鲁总理昨天说到：“这些原则如能在更广泛的范围内被承认，那么，对战争的恐惧就可以消失，而合作的精神就可以发展。”在我这次访问印度与尼赫鲁总理的会谈中，尼赫鲁总理和我都认为，这些原则应该贯彻到今天亚洲及世界的国际关系中。
    我深信，中印两国的共同努力，一定会对亚洲及世界的和平事业作出重大贡献。
    中国人民和印度人民的友谊万岁！
    亚洲和平万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
