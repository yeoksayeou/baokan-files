Students from national higher industrial schools have begun production internships one after another. The Northeast is the key area for production internships this year. Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Dalian, Fuxin, Changchun, Harbin, Qiqihar, and other places are receiving large numbers of intern students from all over the country. The intern students will directly participate in production operations and practical work as foremen, section chiefs, workers, or assistants to technicians.

More than 1,100 faculty and students from the Civil Engineering and Architecture departments of Tsinghua University, Harbin Institute of Technology, Tianjin University, and Tongji University have gone to the construction site of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant for production internships, and some faculty and students have already arrived at the site. Their internship scope mainly focuses on industrial and civil buildings; there are also specialized internships in heating and ventilation, water supply and drainage, steel structures, and other areas. This year, more than 4,000 students from the Northeast Institute of Technology are participating in internships, and more than 300 teachers are participating in internship guidance, both of which have doubled compared to last year. The students' internship locations reach 59 places, with more than 1,900 people interning in Anshan alone. More than 3,000 students from Tianjin University are participating in internships, which is three times more than last year. Internship students from Beijing Mining College, Dalian Institute of Technology, and other schools have successively arrived in eight coal mining areas including Fushun, Fuxin, Hegang, and Jixi. Their internship content includes mine excavation, tunnel engineering, open-pit mining, drilling, washing and beneficiation, and industrial economics. The first group of 1,014 graduates from 13 specialized courses of Jiaotong University, including metalworking, heat treatment, power plants, long-distance telecommunications, and shipbuilding, have all started their internships since June 1st. Interns from the Geology Department of Chongqing University participated in geological exploration in Southwest and Northwest China. The internships of graduate students from Beijing Geological Institute, Beijing Petroleum Institute, Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, and Northeast Institute of Technology are led by Soviet experts from each school. They will collect data during the internship to prepare for their graduation theses. A comprehensive research team composed of teachers from Beijing Geological Institute will conduct scientific research in conjunction with production internships.

Each school has made necessary preparations before the students participate in production internships. The vast majority of schools have established production internship guidance committees. The teaching and research departments of each school have formulated preliminary internship plans based on the nature and purpose of the internships of each department and major. As early as mid-April, the Northeast Institute of Technology held a meeting to prepare for internships, and in mid-May, it held a production internship work conference attended by heads of various departments to conduct detailed research and discussion on various issues related to production internships. Soviet experts from the Northeast Institute of Technology have given reports on production internship issues to teachers who guide internships. Many teachers from the teaching and research departments of Jiaotong University who participated in internship guidance have gone to many factories and enterprises in Northeast China, North China, and Shanghai to carefully study the actual situation and technical conditions of the factories and enterprises, and formulate internship plans.

Many factories and mines have specially established production technology guidance institutions for intern students, and appointed special personnel to guide students' internships. The Southwest Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government has specially stipulated that students' production internships should be included in the work plans of its affiliated factories. The Upper Reaches Engineering Bureau of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission has prepared enough life jackets for the interns and has properly arranged accommodation. The Hangzhou Iron Factory organized a product exhibition on the second day of the arrival of the interns from Zhejiang University for the interns to visit and study. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国高等工业学校学生陆续开始生产实习
    全国高等工业学校学生陆续开始生产实习。东北是今年生产实习的重点地区。沈阳、鞍山、抚顺、本溪、大连、阜新、长春、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔等地正在接纳来自全国各地的大批实习学生。实习学生将以工长、工段长、工人或技术员的助手身份，直接参加生产操作和实际工作。
    清华大学、哈尔滨工业大学、天津大学和同济大学的土木、建筑学系有一千一百多名师生到第一汽车制造厂工地进行生产实习，现在已有部分师生到达工地。他们的实习范围是以工业建筑和民用建筑为主；另有暖气通风、上下水道、钢结构等部分专业实习。东北工学院今年有四千多名学生参加实习，有三百多名教师参加实习指导，师生参加实习的人数都比去年增加了一倍。学生的实习地达五十九处，仅在鞍山实习的就有一千九百多人。天津大学参加实习的学生有三千多人，比去年增加了两倍。北京矿业学院、大连工学院等校的实习学生已先后到达抚顺、阜新、鹤岗、鸡西等八个煤矿区，他们实习的内容是矿区开采、井巷工程、露天开采、钻探、洗选及工业经济等。交通大学第一批参加生产实习的金工、热处理、发电厂、长途电讯、船舶制造等十三个专业的专修科毕业班学生一千零十四人，从六月一日起已全部开始实习。重庆大学地质系的实习生参加了西南和西北等地区的地质勘探。北京地质学院、北京石油学院、北京钢铁工业学院、东北工学院等校研究生的实习，由各校苏联专家带领，他们将在实习中收集资料，为毕业论文作准备。由北京地质学院教师组成的综合研究队，将结合着生产实习进行科学研究工作。
    各校在学生参加生产实习之前都作了必要的准备工作。绝大部分学校都成立了生产实习指导委员会。各校教研室根据各系及专业的实习性质、目的，拟订了初步的实习计划。东北工学院早在四月中旬就召开了实习准备工作会议，在五月中旬又召开了各部门负责人参加的生产实习工作会议，对生产实习的各项问题进行了详细的研究和讨论。东北工学院苏联专家曾向指导实习的教师作了生产实习问题的报告。交通大学各教研室的许多参加实习指导的教师并到东北、华北及上海的许多工厂企业，缜密地研究了工厂企业的实际情况和技术条件，制订了实习计划。
    许多厂矿专门为实习学生成立了生产技术指导机构，指派专人指导学生实习。中央人民政府第一机械工业部西南办事处特规定将学生的生产实习列在所属工厂的工作计划内。长江水利委员会上游工程局特为实习生准备了足够使用的救生衣，并妥善地安排了食宿。杭州铁工厂在浙江大学的实习生到厂的第二天，就布置了一个产品展览会，供实习生们参观学习。（新华社）
