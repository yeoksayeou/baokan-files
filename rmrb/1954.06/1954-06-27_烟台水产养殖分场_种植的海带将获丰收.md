    Yantai Aquatic Product Cultivation Farm
    Kelp Harvest Expected
    The kelp cultivated by the Yantai branch of the state-owned Shandong Aquatic Product Cultivation Farm is growing well and is expected to have a bumper harvest. Since the farm began planting in the Yantai Bay area last October, using wide-row close planting and cluster clamping methods, the kelp has grown very luxuriantly thanks to the active management of all employees. Last year, a two-zhang-long kelp dispersal rope only produced seventeen or eighteen jin of fresh kelp. This year, an average one-zhang-long dispersal rope can produce forty jin of fresh kelp, and the highest yield has reached as much as ninety-five jin, breaking the record of the most productive units in previous years. It is estimated that this year's total harvest will reach 500,000 jin, more than double the original plan. The farm's employees are now working intensely on the harvesting and preparing to expand the planting area next year.
    Note: Artificial kelp cultivation involves clamping kelp seedlings onto ropes in October, placing them in seawater, and tying wooden sticks to the ropes to make them float on the surface, allowing the kelp to grow downwards into the water. Currently, only Qingdao and Yantai in China use artificial kelp cultivation. Qingdao's kelp production this year is also about double that of last year.

    烟台水产养殖分场
    种植的海带将获丰收
    国营山东水产养殖场烟台分场种植的海带，生长良好，将获丰收。该场自去年十月在烟台海湾附近采用宽幅密植和簇夹种植法下种以来，经过全体员工的积极经营，海带生长十分茂盛。去年在一根二丈长的海带分散绳上仅产鲜海带十七、八斤，而今年一根一丈长的分散绳上平均就能产鲜海带四十斤，最高的竟能达到九十五斤之多，打破历年丰产单位的最高纪录。预计今年的总收获量将达五十万斤，超原计划一倍以上。现养殖场职工正进行紧张的收割工作，并准备扩大下一年的种植面积。
    按：人工种植海带是十月间将海带秧夹在绳上，放在海水中，绳上系木棍使其漂浮水面，海带便向水中生长。目前在我国仅有青岛、烟台两处用人工种植海带，青岛的海带今年也比去年增产一倍左右。
