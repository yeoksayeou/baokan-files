Letter of Respect from the Children of the Capital to Chairman Mao

Dear Chairman Mao:

Let us warmly greet you!

We are the children who live by your side. Today is our own happy holiday. We are going to happily go everywhere to play, watch movies, watch plays, go boating, and hold celebrations. We are so happy!

Dear Chairman Mao: On this happy day, we especially miss and thank you. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and you, our days are getting better and better. We are growing taller, fatter, and stronger every day, and we are gaining more and more knowledge. We know that our great motherland is carrying out socialist construction, and we also know that the worker and farmer uncles are working hard to carry out production and construction. We also know that the Liberation Army and Volunteer Army uncles are defending our happy life, and we know even more that we children are the successors to the great socialist cause of the motherland.

Dear Chairman Mao: We assure you that we will study hard, strengthen our physical exercise, and be ready at all times: to strive for the construction of the motherland and to realize your great ideals! When we grow up, we will dedicate all our strength to the motherland and to the people.

Finally, let us, on behalf of all the children in Beijing, extend to you the warmest and most sublime Young Pioneer salute! And sincerely wish you good health!

    首都儿童给毛主席的致敬信亲爱的毛主席：
    让我们热情地向您问好！
    我们是生活在您身边的孩子。今天是我们自己的快乐的节日。我们将要高高兴兴地到各处去玩，看电影、看话剧、划船、开庆祝会。我们真是太幸福了！
    亲爱的毛主席：我们在这幸福的日子里，特别想念和感谢您。在共产党和您的领导下，我们的日子一天比一天过得更好啦。我们一天天的长高了，长胖了，愈来愈健壮了，得到的知识越来越多了。我们知道，我们伟大的祖国正在进行社会主义建设，我们也知道，工人农民叔叔们正在努力地进行生产建设，我们还知道，解放军和志愿军叔叔们正在保卫着我们幸福生活，我们更知道，我们少年儿童是祖国伟大的社会主义事业的继承者。
    亲爱的毛主席：我们向您保证：一定好好学习，加强锻炼自己的身体，时刻准备着：为建设祖国的事业，为实现您的伟大理想而奋斗！我们长大了以后，要把自己的一切力量贡献给祖国，贡献给人民。
    最后，让我们代表全北京市的少年儿童向您致以最热情最崇高的少年先锋队队礼！并衷心地祝您身体健康！
