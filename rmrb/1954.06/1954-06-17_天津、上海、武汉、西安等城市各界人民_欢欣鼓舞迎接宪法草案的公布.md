Xinhua News Agency dispatch: On the morning of the 15th, Tianjin Radio broadcast the full text of the draft constitution to the city. In the morning, the poster boards along the streets were crowded with people reading the news. Many shops, factories and schools posted propaganda slogans. On the 15th, the retail sales of four newspapers including "Ta Kung Pao" and "Tianjin Daily" increased by more than 89,000 copies compared to the 14th. More than 100 workers in the steelmaking department of the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant went to the club for a meeting immediately after getting off the early shift. Yi Bin, director of the steelmaking department, gave a report to the workers on the draft constitution. The workers expressed their approval and said they would make greater achievements in production. Steelworker Li Jinhai and the workers in his group improved production in their work that day, reducing the time to refine a furnace of steel by seven minutes compared to the 14th, and 13 minutes less than the operation plan. Workers at the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 and No. 3 Cotton Textile Factories rushed to the auditorium to listen to the newspaper being read after getting off the early shift. Fine yarn worker Bai Lanxiang said: In the past, female workers would lose their jobs if they had children. After liberation, the government established nurseries and there was labor protection, so mothers and children were doing well. Now the draft constitution makes even clearer provisions, and the welfare of mothers and children is even more guaranteed. Teachers and students in Tianjin schools also held discussion meetings.
    [Shanghai Liberation Daily Dispatch] The people of Shanghai warmly welcome the promulgation of the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China.
    In factories, workers read the draft constitution published in the newspaper during their lunch break. Wang Derong, an old planer at the Shanghai Railway Administration Engineering Works Repair Shop, was a participant in the "February 7th" strike. In the three months from February to April this year, he completed fourteen months of production tasks. After seeing the draft constitution, he excitedly said: What we fought for thirty years ago is now all fixed in our draft constitution. Advanced workers from various state-owned cotton textile factories in Shanghai are currently observing demonstrations at the No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory. When the news of the promulgation of the draft constitution came, they immediately organized a newspaper reading discussion. Model workers unanimously expressed that they would learn their skills well and be leaders in socialist construction. Members of the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs were busy pumping water and transplanting rice seedlings. After receiving the newspaper, they immediately gathered around it. They warmly welcomed the articles in the draft constitution that clearly encourage peasants to take the path of collectivization. Commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai were even more excited about the promulgation of the draft constitution. Wang Lihe, a company commander and second-class combat hero of a certain unit, said: We used blood to create the first people's charter in Chinese history, and we will spare no sacrifice to defend it. The broad masses of women, cultural and educational workers, scientific workers and medical workers in Shanghai are also joyfully welcoming the promulgation of the draft constitution. Shanghai business and industrial figures Sheng Pihua, Rong Yiren, Liu Hongsheng, and religious figures Wu Yaozong, etc., unanimously expressed their support for the draft constitution.
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: On the morning of the 15th, Wuhan was immersed in an atmosphere of joy. Post office postmen excitedly spread the good news of the promulgation of the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China everywhere. The post office's mobile newspaper sales carts were immediately surrounded by crowds wherever they went. Newspaper retail sales increased by more than 20,000 copies compared to usual.
    The builders who are working hard on the upper works of the Hanshui Railway Bridge and striving to open it to traffic in October welcomed this good news with infinite joy. Workers and technicians in the work area gave up their lunch break to read the newspaper and chat together. The workers unanimously expressed that they would support the draft constitution with practical actions to better complete the project. Zhang Shihang, an old worker from the "February 7th" strike in the Jiang'an area, said excitedly while reading the draft constitution: "The 'February 7th' strike was to fight for freedom, human rights, and equality; in the draft constitution announced today, all the rights we demanded in the past are provided for." Zhu Zaodi, a special-class labor model in Wuhan, said at a group discussion: "The draft constitution stipulates that citizens have the right to work, and also stipulates the gradual expansion of material conditions for workers' rest and recuperation; this will encourage us to work harder to increase production and contribute more to the realization of the country's socialist industrialization."
    On this day, cultural, educational and scientific figures in Wuhan, such as Tao Shuzeng, also expressed their opinions, expressing their support for the draft constitution. Business and industrial figures also held special discussions.
    [Xi'an Masses Daily Dispatch] People from all walks of life in Xi'an warmly support the draft constitution. After the draft constitution was promulgated on the 15th, Liu Yulian, an old worker who had participated in the "February 7th" struggle, led a workers' propaganda team with colorful flags to publicize it in various workshops. Cui Kerang, a labor model from the Northwest Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Plant, said excitedly after hearing the news of the promulgation of the draft constitution: "Now we can have a real constitution!" Commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army were also elated after seeing the draft constitution. Liu Jiyao, a combat hero of the "Capture of Huashan" of the Shaanxi Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said: "I will resolutely support and implement the constitution and am willing to contribute all my strength to the prosperity and happiness of the motherland."
    Members of the Caojiamiao Agricultural Production Cooperative, who are currently involved in the summer harvest, cheered immediately after hearing the news of the promulgation of the draft constitution. After cooperative member Sun Yulong explained the preamble and general outline of the draft constitution to everyone, Sun Zhanbiao, the director of the cooperative, couldn't help but laugh. He said, "The draft constitution really conforms to the interests of our working people, and it has written into it the things we have done in the past and the path of mutual assistance and cooperation we will take in the future." Finally, after discussion among the cooperative members, it was decided to sell 20,000 jin of surplus wheat harvested by the whole cooperative to the state to express support for the draft constitution.
    Northwest University held a conference that day, where President Hou Wailu explained the great significance of the promulgation of the draft constitution. An Zhijie, Ahong of the Huajue Lane Mosque in Xi'an, loudly read the draft constitution to the Ahong and Mullahs of the mosque. The heads of eight Hui Muslim mass reading rooms in Maijian Street and Sajinqiao Street in Xi'an immediately held a meeting after seeing the draft constitution to study how to mobilize the Hui Muslim masses to read and discuss it.
