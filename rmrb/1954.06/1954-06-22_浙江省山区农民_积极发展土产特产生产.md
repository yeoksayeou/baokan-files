Farmers in the vast mountainous areas of Zhejiang Province, under the leadership of the People's Government, are actively developing the production of local and special products to support the country's socialist construction.

    To meet the growing needs of urban and rural people for edible oil, mountain farmers in Changshan, Qingtian, Lishui, Yunhe and other counties have expanded the planting of oil-tea camellias by more than 24,000 mu last winter and this spring. At the same time, they are also actively managing old oil-tea camellia forests. Tu Jin’di, a model worker in Xuanping County, created a method of oil-tea camellia propagation by cuttings, which can yield harvests three or four years earlier than general direct seeding. It only takes about four years to start harvesting tea seeds. Relevant departments are now studying this propagation method in the hope of promoting it widely.

    Silkworm farmers in the mountainous areas have a high level of confidence in developing silkworm production. According to incomplete statistics from Shengxian, Fuyang, Xindeng, Lin’an, Xinchang, Zhuji, Changhua and other counties, more than 16,000 mu of mulberry gardens have been expanded in the mountainous areas this year. Three years later, these newly expanded mulberry gardens can produce about 200 jin of mulberry leaves per mu, which can be used to feed silkworms, increasing the country's silkworm cocoon production by 2,000 dan and increasing the income of the people in the mountainous areas by the equivalent of more than 1.2 million jin of rice.

    The province has restored and newly developed more than 15,000 mu of tea gardens this year. This spring, many organized tea farmers have formulated plans to develop tea production, actively reclaim wasteland, expand the area of tea planting, and improve production technology in order to produce more tea.

    Some mountain farmers in Huangyan, Yongjia and other counties have begun to learn from the state-owned Huangyan Citrus Farm to plant citrus on the mountains. Local mountain farmers are very enthusiastic about developing fruit tree production, and more citrus trees will grow on the slopes in the future.

    浙江省山区农民
    积极发展土产特产生产
    浙江省广大山区的农民在人民政府领导下，积极发展土产特产生产，支援国家的社会主义建设。
    为了满足城乡人民对食油日益增长的需要，常山、青田、丽水、云和等县的山区农民，在去冬和今春已经扩种了二万四千多亩油茶，同时，还积极管理老油茶林。宣平县劳动模范涂金地创造了油茶插条繁殖法，比一般直播的油茶可以提早三、四年收获，只需四年左右，即可开始采收茶籽，现在有关部门正在研究这种繁殖方法，以期普遍推广。
    山区的养蚕农民对发展蚕桑生产的信心很高，根据嵊县、富阳、新登、临安、新昌、诸暨、昌化等县的不完全统计，今年山区已经扩大了一万六千多亩桑园，三年后，这些新扩大的桑园，每亩可采摘桑叶二百斤左右，用以饲蚕，可为国家增产二千担蚕茧，为山区人民增加相当于一百二十余万斤大米的收入。
    全省今年恢复和新发展的茶园有一万五千亩以上。今年春天，许多组织起来的茶农都订出了发展茶叶生产的计划，积极开垦荒山，扩大茶树种植面积，改进生产技术，以便多生产茶叶。
    黄岩、永嘉等县部分山区农民，已开始向国营黄岩柑橘场学习，把柑橘种到山上。当地山区农民对发展果树生产的积极性很高，今后将有更多的柑橘树在山坡上生长起来。
