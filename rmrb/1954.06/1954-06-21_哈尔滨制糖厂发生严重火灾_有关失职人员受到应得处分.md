    Serious Fire at Harbin Sugar Factory
    Negligent Personnel Duly Punished

    On December 11, 1953, at 7:18 PM, a fire broke out at the Harbin Sugar Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Harbin City. The fire burned for eleven hours, destroying 75% of the factory buildings, 47% of the machinery, products worth 1.8 billion yuan, and tools and spare parts worth 300 million yuan, totaling a direct loss of 2.5 billion yuan.

    The factory buildings and equipment of the Harbin Sugar Factory were very old, and the temperature in each workshop was high, and the air was particularly dry, making it easy to catch fire. However, the factory's leading cadres had not paid attention to security work. Since the start of operations, they had not only failed to discuss fire prevention issues, but also failed to study the fire prevention instructions and suggestions from relevant departments such as the Public Security Bureau, insurance companies, and fire brigades. They also lacked regular fire prevention education for employees. The factory's fire prevention organization was basically a formality, with no clear fire prevention system and no dedicated personnel to manage fire prevention equipment, resulting in fire prevention tools being thrown around and lost. The factory not only failed to strengthen the leadership of the full-time fire brigade but also greatly reduced it, considering it "ineffective." In the short two months before this major fire, the factory had experienced four fire alarms, but they still failed to improve fire prevention and security work.

    The fire originated in the main steam drum room of the auxiliary workshop and spread to the sugar production workshop and the main sections of the auxiliary workshop within a dozen minutes. The main steam drum room was located in the center of the factory building and was one of the factory's power sources and an important department. The steam drum was equipped with two eight-inch diameter iron pipes, with dry gas temperatures reaching 290 to 295 degrees Celsius, and the indoor temperature was often above 40 degrees Celsius. However, the insulation equipment on the steam pipes was very poor, and the small room was cluttered with flammable materials such as wooden shelves, torn oilcloth, torn filter cloth, rubber hoses, thread ends, and wooden sticks. In the past, sacks and filter cloth placed on the steam pipes in the main steam drum room had been scorched and caught fire. About twenty days before this major fire, filter cloth had caught fire, but this still did not attract the attention of the factory leadership. They neither improved the insulation of the steam pipes nor removed the flammable debris, resulting in the fire finally being caused by the fifth scorching of broken sacks and other materials.

    Because the Harbin Sugar Factory had always neglected security work, although several people discovered the fire at the same time, they did not take emergency measures to rescue it. When the fire grew larger, there was a lack of effective organization and command, resulting in chaos and serious losses. After investigation and study, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Supervisory Committee of the Northeast Administrative Committee imposed punishments on the personnel mainly responsible for the fire.

    Ma Kun (Communist Party member), who was not formally appointed but was actually in charge of the deputy factory director's duties, was usually arrogant, had a poor sense of responsibility, and paid very little attention to fire prevention. Ma Kun was on the night shift when the fire broke out. When workers reported the fire to him, the fire was not serious, and it could have been extinguished in time with proper rescue measures. However, he not only failed to actively organize workers to rescue it but also fled the scene. During the subsequent investigation, he deliberately distorted the facts to evade responsibility. It was decided to expel him from the Party, administratively remove him from his post, and hand him over to the court for legal punishment.

    Deputy Factory Director Liu Chunmao (Secretary of the Party General Branch) simply emphasized production and neglected fire prevention work. He shelved the fire prevention measures and suggestions issued by the Public Security Bureau, insurance companies, and other agencies, as well as the fire prevention plans proposed by lower levels, for a long time, believing that the factory's fire brigade was "ineffective" and reducing it from nine to three people. He should be held largely responsible for this fire. However, Liu Chunmao was a newly promoted worker cadre who lacked experience, had consistently worked actively in the past, and had performed well in rescue and aftermath work after the fire. He also had a correct understanding of his mistakes. Therefore, it was decided to impose a lighter punishment, administratively removing him from his post and issuing a public warning within the Party.

    Chen Zongkui (Deputy Engineer, concurrently in charge of technical security work), the first deputy director of the production command room, had seen four consecutive fire alarms occur in the workshops under his direct leadership in just over two months, but he had not investigated or dealt with them. Twenty days before this fire, when the filter cloth in the main steam drum room was scorched, someone reported it to him, but he still did not investigate or deal with it, improve the insulation device, or report it to the factory director, resulting in this fire. Therefore, it was decided to give him a dismissal punishment.

    Yu Yunsheng, deputy director of the auxiliary workshop, directly led the main steam drum room, but he never conducted major inspections. Although Deputy Factory Director Liu had repeatedly instructed and criticized him, he did not try to improve the insulation device in the main steam drum room, which had caused several fire alarms. Therefore, it was decided to give him a dismissal punishment.

    Niu Jipu, who was not formally appointed but was actually in charge of the deputy director's duties in the production command room, consistently failed to implement the instructions of Deputy Factory Director Liu Chunmao, who had repeatedly told him to clear the cluttered items in the main steam drum room (although Liu's motive was for cleanliness), resulting in these cluttered items becoming the medium for the fire. Therefore, it was decided to give him a major demerit punishment.

    Wang Zuoyao, the former deputy secretary of the General Branch, also failed to implement the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee's Industrial Department on conducting fire prevention safety education and fire prevention inspections among the masses after the factory had experienced several fire alarms in the past. It was decided to give him a public warning within the Party.

    In the year and a half before the fire at the Harbin Sugar Factory, there had been several major fires in Harbin City. After the sugar factory fire, the privately-owned Shuanghesheng Flour Mill also caught fire and was destroyed, which shows that the leadership in Harbin City had not done enough to seriously summarize and accept lessons learned and strengthen the leadership and inspection of security work. In order to educate all state personnel and accept this painful lesson, the People's Supervisory Committee of the Northeast Administrative Committee, in addition to instructing the Harbin Municipal People's Government to immediately take effective measures to conduct a general inspection of the fire prevention work of various factories and mining enterprises to strengthen security work, also decided, with the approval of the Northeast Administrative Committee and with the consent of the People's Supervisory Committee of the Government Administration Council, to give Harbin Mayor Lü Qien a warning punishment. Deputy Mayor and Director of the Public Security Bureau Wang Huacheng and Director of the Industry Bureau Hu Yinkui were given demerit punishments.

### 哈尔滨制糖厂发生严重火灾  有关失职人员受到应得处分

    哈尔滨制糖厂发生严重火灾
    有关失职人员受到应得处分
    哈尔滨市地方国营哈尔滨制糖厂于一九五三年十二月十一日下午七时十八分发生火灾，大火烧了十一小时，厂房被烧毁百分之七十五，机器损失百分之四十七，产品损失价值十八亿元，工具与备品损失价值三亿元，总计全部直接损失达二百五十亿元。
    哈尔滨制糖厂的厂房和设备都很陈旧，各车间的温度很高，空气也特别干燥，很容易发生火灾。但是厂的领导干部一直不注意保安工作。开工以来不但没有讨论过防火问题，而且对公安局、保险公司、消防队等有关部门的防火指示与建议也没有作过研究，对职工也缺乏经常的防火教育。厂内的防火组织基本上流于形式，没有明确的防火制度，没有专人管理防火设备，以致防火工具被乱扔、丢失。对厂内的专职消防队，不仅不去加强领导，反而认为“不起作用”而大大缩减。这个厂在这次大火以前的短短两个月中曾发生过四次火警，但他们仍旧没有改进防火保安工作。
    这次大火是从辅助车间总汽包室发生的，起火后十几分钟就蔓延到制糖车间和辅助车间的主要工段。总汽包室设在厂房的中心，是厂的动力之一，也是重要部门之一。汽包上装有直径八吋的铁管两根，管中的干气温度达二百九十度到二百九十五度，室内气温也经常在四十度以上。但汽管上的保温装备却非常不好，在这面积很小的房中又杂乱地堆放着木制货架子、破油布、破泸布、胶皮管、线头、木棍等许多容易燃烧的东西。过去，总汽包室里放在汽管上的麻袋和泸布曾经烤焦起过火，在这次大火发生前二十天左右就发生过泸布起火；但还是没有引起这厂领导上的重视，既没有改进汽管的保温装置，也没有去清除那些容易燃烧的破烂东西，结果，终于因第五次烤焦破麻袋等东西而引起了大火。
    由于哈尔滨制糖厂一向忽视保安工作，在起火当时虽然有几个人同时发现，但他们都没有采取紧急措施进行抢救。火烧大了，又缺乏有力的组织指挥，以致乱成一团，造成了严重的损失。中共哈尔滨市委会和东北行政委员会人民监察委员会经过调查研究，对这次火灾负有主要责任人员分别给了处分。
    没有正式任命但在实际上负责副厂长职务的马昆（共产党员），平时居功自傲责任心很差，对防火极不重视；发生火灾时马昆正值夜班，工人向他报告失了火，他赶到现场时，火势并不严重，只要抢救得法，是可以及时扑灭的；但他不但没有积极组织工人抢救，反而逃出现场。事后进行检查时他又故意歪曲事实，想逃避责任。决定开除党籍，行政上给予撤职处分，并交法院依法惩办。
    副厂长刘春茂（党总支书记），单纯强调生产，忽视防火工作，对公安局和保险公司等机关发的防火措施与建议，以及下边提出的防火计划，长期搁置不问，认为厂内消防队“不起作用”，将九人缩减为三人，应对这次火灾负很大责任。但刘春茂是新提拔的工人干部，缺乏经验，过去工作一贯积极，火灾发生后在抢救工作与善后工作中都表现很好，对自己的错误也有正确的认识，因此决定从轻处分，行政上撤职，党内当众警告。
    生产指挥室第一副主任陈宗奎（副工程师，兼管技术保安工作）两个多月中在他直接领导下的各车间曾连续发生过四次火警，但他都没有检查处理。在这次火灾发生的前二十天，总汽包室烤燃滤布时，就有人向他报告，但他仍然没有检查处理，改进保温装置，也没有报告厂长，以致又引起这次火灾。因此决定给以撤职处分。
    辅助车间副主任于云声直接领导总汽包室，但他从来没有进行过大检查，虽经刘副厂长数次指示和批评也不想办法去改进曾经引起过几次火警的总汽包室保温装置。因此决定给以撤职处分。
    没有正式任命但在实际上负责生产指挥室副主任职务的牛吉普，对于副厂长刘春茂几次叫他清除总汽包室杂乱物品（但刘的动机是为了清洁卫生）的指示，始终不执行，结果这些杂乱物品成了火灾的媒介。因此决定给以记大过处分。
    原总支副书记王作瑶，在工厂过去几次发生火警后，对市委工业部关于向群众进行防火安全教育和防火检查的指示，也没有执行。决定党内予以当众警告处分。
    在哈尔滨制糖厂发生火灾前一年多中，哈尔滨市曾经发生过几次重大火灾。在制糖厂火灾以后，私营双合盛制粉厂又起火烧毁，这说明哈尔滨市领导方面对认真总结与接受经验教训，加强保安工作的领导和检查做得很不够。东北行政委员会人民监察委员会为教育全体国家工作人员，接受这一沉痛教训，除指示哈尔滨市人民政府立即采取有效措施普遍对各厂矿企业的防火工作进行一次检查，以加强保安工作外，同时经东北行政委员会批准，并经政务院人民监察委员会同意，决定给予哈尔滨市市长吕其恩以警告处分。给副市长兼公安局局长王化成、工业局长胡尹奎以记过处分。
