    Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital Holds Second Anniversary Celebration

    On June 19th, the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital held a celebration for its second anniversary. More than 600 Chinese and Soviet medical staff from the entire hospital attended the celebration. Lin Shixiao, Deputy Secretary-General of the Red Cross Society of China, Wang Kangjiu, Secretary-General of the Beijing Branch of the Red Cross Society of China, and Xue Zizheng, Secretary-General of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, attended to offer their congratulations. Vasnov, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, also attended to offer congratulations. At the meeting, Bazhenov, the president of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital, reported on the hospital's development in the past two years. Representatives of hospitalized patients congratulated the Soviet experts and presented flowers and flags.

    In the past two years, more than 120,000 people from all over the country have visited the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital for medical treatment. Patients who come to the hospital for treatment can receive careful treatment and cordial care from Soviet experts. In the past two years, the hospital's auxiliary departments have provided patients with more than 290,000 physical therapy and fluoroscopy treatments, and the operating room has performed more than 3,000 operations for patients. Many patients suffering from diseases considered difficult to treat in other hospitals in China have quickly received correct diagnosis and treatment here. Yu Huazhang, a patient from the Northeast, suffered from lymphoepithelioma and received ineffective treatment in three hospitals in Shenyang. When he came to the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital in May this year, his condition was already very serious. After being correctly diagnosed by Soviet experts, he was injected with "Embichin," a new drug recently invented in the Soviet Union. In just half a month, his condition improved significantly. Sometimes Soviet experts personally care for critically ill patients. One day, Wu Shuwen, a hairdresser's family member who was hospitalized for heart failure, suddenly became seriously ill. Kaimarskaya, the director of internal medicine and a Soviet expert, stayed by her side all night, personally caring for and treating her, until the patient recovered before leaving the ward. The hospital holds an academic report meeting once a week, attracting many medical professionals to attend and listen. Soviet experts in the hospital often give reports inside and outside the hospital, and engage in teaching young doctors and nurses in the hospital. Soviet experts also often go to other hospitals in Beijing for consultation to help Chinese medical workers solve difficult medical problems. In the past three months or so, Soviet experts have consulted with other hospitals more than 20 times. Many health administration departments, medical colleges, and hospitals in various places have organized visits to this hospital to absorb advanced Soviet medical ideas and advanced experience. Many units, including the Peking Union Medical College Hospital and the Beijing Medical College Hospital, have visited here. In the past three months, more than 1,000 people have visited this hospital. Soviet experts stipulate a certain amount of time to introduce the medical equipment and medical system to the visitors. Every day, hundreds of letters are sent here from all over the country. Some letters thank the Soviet experts, some letters inquire about the hospital's advanced medical system, and many patients hope to receive guidance and help from the Soviet experts. In the past two years, the hospital has received more than 20,000 letters from the masses, and each letter has received the hospital's careful reply and handling.
