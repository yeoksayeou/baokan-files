    How the Northwest Agricultural College Absorbs Soviet Textbooks
    Zhang Dingzhao

      I.

    Since 1950, Northwest Agricultural College has been absorbing Soviet textbooks and steadily carrying out teaching reforms. Over the past twenty years, the old textbooks used in the college have been gradually replaced by advanced Soviet textbooks; and advanced Soviet agricultural bioscience has been gradually integrated with China's actual conditions to serve the country's socialist transformation of agriculture.

    The process of Northwest Agricultural College learning from the Soviet Union and absorbing Soviet textbooks has undergone a complex and tortuous ideological struggle. In 1949, shortly after the liberation of the Northwest, although the teachers of Northwest Agricultural College had begun to come into contact with the Soviet agricultural bioscience of Michurin's theories, teachers generally held a skeptical and contemptuous attitude towards Soviet science, believing that "the Soviet Union has its own way in politics, but its science is not as good as that of Britain and the United States." Some teachers also began to absorb some Soviet textbooks, but this was "forced by the general trend," and they had to embellish it a bit. After the ideological remolding in 1952, the bourgeois ideology in the old textbooks was criticized, and after recognizing the bad tendency of theory being divorced from practice, the teachers generally felt an urgent need for new textbooks. They believed that only Soviet textbooks could infinitely meet this need, so they gradually moved from skeptical to consciously absorbing Soviet textbooks; but most teachers still did not understand the difference between Soviet textbooks and British and American textbooks. They believed that Soviet textbooks should be used for courses such as biology, but for basic courses, there was not much difference between Soviet textbooks and British and American textbooks. By 1953, after studying the theory of practice, the theory of contradiction, Darwinism, and Michurin's genetic theories, the teachers had initially established a dialectical materialist viewpoint on agricultural bioscience. At the same time, the teaching plan had also been revised, the amount of Soviet textbooks absorbed had increased, the content had been enriched, and the goals had been clarified. All courses have absorbed Soviet textbooks to varying degrees. 25% of the courses use Soviet textbooks, 42% are based on Soviet textbooks, combined with China's conditions to simplify or compile them, and 18% should be based on Chinese textbooks due to the nature of the course, or limited by conditions, only partially use Soviet textbooks. In addition, 47 teachers translated 40 kinds of Soviet textbooks; during the same period, they also overcame the once-appeared impetuous and rash emotions, gradually attached importance to combining with China's actual conditions, so that the teaching reform steadily moved forward on the normal track, and continued to deepen and improve.

    II.

    In this complex and tortuous process of absorbing Soviet textbooks, Northwest Agricultural College has taken different measures according to the ideological situation of the teachers in each period, and constantly overcome some prominent ideological obstacles.

    The first is to change the teachers' initial skepticism and passive attitude towards Soviet textbooks. To this end, Northwest Agricultural College took the following measures: First, universally call for and vigorously support the use of Soviet textbooks. For example, although there were Soviet textbooks for reinforced concrete structure in water conservancy engineering, the teachers did not understand that Soviet design methods had been widely used in China's water conservancy projects. They thought that "British and American standards are still used in the actual work of water conservancy engineering. Although Soviet textbooks are good, if taught to students, I am afraid they will not be able to use them after graduation," so they hesitated. The college used the actual situation at the time to dispel the teachers' concerns and encouraged everyone to actively adopt Soviet textbooks, which proved to be very effective, and the students also welcomed it; then they used the experience and understanding of these teachers to encourage everyone to adopt Soviet textbooks. Second, teach key courses well and play a demonstrative role. For example, courses such as Darwinism and Michurin genetics adopted Soviet textbooks earlier, had more teaching experience, and had better teaching results. The college further taught these courses well, setting an example to inspire everyone: to achieve good teaching results, Soviet textbooks must be used; at the same time, students with advanced Soviet bioscience viewpoints will directly improve their ability to accept Soviet textbooks. Third, mobilize teachers to help each other and learn from each other, and use advanced Soviet theories to solve problems that cannot be solved by bourgeois theories. For example, the basal branches of seedling fruit trees cannot be used as scions, and bourgeois theories cannot explain this reason, so some teachers cannot explain this reason either, but some teachers who have accepted Lysenko's theory can explain it with the "stage development" theory. This stimulated the teachers' enthusiasm for using Soviet textbooks. Fourth, organize teachers to conduct experiments. In 1951, the college launched a small-scale study of Michurin's theories, and conducted vernalization experiments and asexual hybridization experiments of cotton, asexual hybridization experiments of cucumbers, and sheep hybridization experiments on the farm, so that teachers could experience the correctness of advanced Soviet science from these experiments, criticize the bourgeois erroneous viewpoints in the past breeding problems, and use vivid and living facts to dispel the skeptical attitude of many teachers towards Soviet textbooks. Fifth, summarize experience and improve understanding. The college summarized four experiences in absorbing Soviet textbooks at the end of a semester, organized teachers to study them, and improved teachers' understanding and confidence in absorbing Soviet textbooks.

    The second is to solve the specific difficulties in the process of absorbing Soviet textbooks. After the teachers overcame their skeptical attitude, recognized the superiority of Soviet textbooks, and actively absorbed Soviet textbooks, they encountered many difficulties. The college then immediately took the following measures to enable teachers to understand the spirit and essence of Soviet textbooks: First, improve teachers' theoretical and scientific level. Teachers' inability to understand many problems in Soviet textbooks is due to their metaphysical viewpoints and methods and their low level of science and technology. For example, a teacher once raised the following question about the problem of crop degradation: "Potatoes transplanted from the cool north to the hot south cannot meet the requirements of their heredity, so they will degrade, but if crops grow in the same environmental conditions for a long time, they will also degrade. How can these two contradictory situations be explained, and how can they not be degraded?" After repeated comparison, analysis, and research, the teachers understood that it is impossible to explain the above contradictory situation by using a metaphysical viewpoint to mechanically oppose the two situations from the form, while using Michurin's theory of "unity of biology and environment" can dialectically understand this contradiction, that is: potatoes degrade in the south because the environmental conditions exceed the range that their heredity can adapt to; and long-term growth in the same environmental conditions makes their heredity more conservative and their adaptability smaller, and they will inevitably degrade. By improving the teachers' theoretical and scientific level, they also improved their ability to understand Soviet textbooks. Second, verify the scientific basis of Soviet textbooks through investigation, research, experiments, and practical contact methods. For example, a vegetable teacher visited vegetable farmers in Wugong County and found that the vegetable farmers used variable temperature treatment of watermelon seeds and used the cultivation method of cluster sowing to obtain high yields, which coincided with advanced Soviet experience. A fruit tree teacher also went to Qian County to observe the fruit tree situation in mountainous areas and found that "raising seedlings on the mountains and planting trees on the mountains" can make fruit trees drought-resistant, which is exactly the same as Michurin's "Spartan" domestication method. This made the teachers further trust advanced Soviet science. Third, remedial Russian. In the early stage of absorbing Soviet textbooks, a big difficulty was that most teachers did not understand Russian, so the college organized intensive professional Russian language learning, so that most teachers could directly and comprehensively read Russian professional books and reference books.

    The third is to seek the combination of Soviet textbooks and China's actual conditions. The college has focused on using the practical experience of guiding China's agricultural production based on advanced Soviet science to enrich the content of textbooks. For example, many agricultural technical measures promulgated by the Central People's Government were put forward under the guidance of Soviet experts based on advanced Soviet experience and combined with China's actual conditions, and are very valuable teaching materials. The college's practice farm has also achieved high yields of wheat and cotton and increased livestock production due to the adoption of advanced theories in Soviet textbooks. For example, the adoption of Soviet shallow and deep tillage systems, dense planting, layered and staged fertilization, and early cotton sowing according to soil temperature have made the per-mu yield of wheat on a large area 36% higher than the local yield, and the per-mu yield of cotton on a large area 163% higher than the local yield, thus winning the Shaanxi Province wheat and cotton high yield award flag. These practical materials greatly improved the quality of teaching.

    III.

    The above experiences show that the key to absorbing Soviet textbooks and carrying out teaching reform lies in strengthening political and ideological leadership. In the process of carrying out political and ideological leadership, on the one hand, the contradiction and struggle between the new and old ideas of teachers must be fully developed, and advanced socialist scientific theories must be constantly used to criticize and replace the reactionary scientific theories of the bourgeoisie. On the other hand, we must steadily advance through practice and gentle breezes and drizzle, and prevent any impetuous emotions and crude and simple methods. Because scientists "recognize that the path experienced by communism is to achieve practical results in their own field of science, for example, agronomists follow their own path to recognize communist ideas, and foresters follow their own path to recognize communist ideas." It is not an easy task for a scientist to change the old ideas that have existed in his mind for more than ten or decades. This is a long-term, arduous, complex, and tortuous process of ideological transformation and practice. A teacher at Northwest Agricultural College always thought that Michurin's theory was not necessarily correct before he realized Michurin's theory through his own personal experience. Later, he tried to use Michurin's method to conduct pollen education with the mixed pollen of Hunan Da Donggua and local Suomian pumpkin. Over the past two years, he cultivated Da Donggua weighing more than 60 kilograms, which was two or three times higher than the local varieties. Only then did he convincingly say: "We didn't understand Michurin's theory in the past, and we insisted that Michurin's theory was not correct. Looking at it today, it was our ignorance, not that Michurin's theory was not correct." From his own practice, he realized that only advanced Soviet science can correctly explain the world and transform the world. In this way, he improved his consciousness and enthusiasm for absorbing Soviet textbooks.

    It should be emphasized that this is an important experience in the teaching reform of Northwest Agricultural College.

    西北农学院怎样吸取苏联教材
    张定照
      一
    西北农学院从一九五零年起，就开始吸取苏联教材，稳步地进行了教学改革。二十多年来在该院所采用的旧教材，逐步被苏联先进教材代替了；并使苏联先进农业生物科学逐步与中国实际相结合，为国家进行农业社会主义改造服务。
    西北农学院学习苏联、吸取苏联教材，是经历了复杂曲折的思想斗争过程的。一九四九年西北解放不久，西北农学院的教师们虽已开始接触苏联农业生物科学米丘林的学说，但是一般教师对于苏联科学抱着怀疑和轻视态度，认为“苏联的政治有一套，科学则不如英美”。有些教师也开始吸收了一些苏联教材，但这是“迫于大势所趋”，不能不粉饰点缀一下，经过一九五二年思想改造，批判了旧教材中的资产阶级思想，并认识了理论与实际脱节的恶劣倾向后，教师们普遍感到迫切需要新教材。他们认为只有苏联教材才能无限地满足这种需要，因此逐步由怀疑而自觉地吸取苏联教材；但多数教师仍不理解苏联教材与英美教材有什么区别。他们认为生物学等课程应采用苏联教材，至于基础课程，苏联教材与英美教材无多大区别。到了一九五三年，教师们又经过了实践论、矛盾论、达尔文主义、米丘林遗传学说的学习，初步建立了辩证唯物主义的农业生物科学观点，同时，教学计划亦已修订，吸取苏联教材的分量增加了，内容丰富了，目标明确了。全部课程都在不同程度上吸取了苏联教材，课程中百分之二十五是苏联教本，百分之四十二是根据苏联教本，结合中国的情况加以精简或编写的，百分之十八由于课程性质应以中国教材为主，或限于条件，只能部分地采用苏联教材，另有四十七位教师翻译了四十种苏联教材；同一期间，又克服了一度出现的急躁冒进情绪，逐步重视与中国实际相结合，使得教学改革在正常的轨道上稳步前进，并不断走向深入和提高。二
    在吸取苏联教材的这一复杂曲折的过程中，西北农学院曾经针对每一时期教师的思想情况，先后采取了不同的措施，不断地克服了一些突出的思想障碍。
    首先是改变教师们初期对苏联教材的怀疑、被动态度。为此，西北农学院采取了如下办法：一，普遍号召与大力支持采用苏联教材，例如水利工程中的钢筋混凝土结构学，虽已有了苏联教材，但教师们还不了解苏联的设计方法已在我国水利工程中大量运用，以为“在水利工程的实际工作用的还是英美标准，苏联教材虽好，教给学生，怕毕业后还是用不上”，因此犹豫不决。院方就以当时实际情况打消教师们的顾虑，鼓励大家积极采用苏联教材，果然收效很好，学生也欢迎；然后又用这些教师的经验和体会来鼓励大家采取苏联教材。二，教好重点课程，起示范作用。例如达尔文主义、米丘林遗传学课程因采用苏联教材较早，教学经验较多，教学效果较好。院方就进一步教好这些课，作出榜样启示大家：要使教学效果良好，必须采用苏联教材；同时，学生有了苏联先进生物科学的观点，也就直接提高了接受苏联教材的能力。三，发动教师互助互学，用苏联先进理论来解决资产阶级学说中所不能解决的问题。例如实生果树基部枝条不能用作接穗，资产阶级学说解释不通这个原因，因而有些教师也解释不通这个原因，但有些教师接受了李森科的学说，就能用“阶段发育”学说加以说明。这就激发了教师们采用苏联教材的情绪。四，组织教师进行实验。一九五一年，该院曾展开小型的米丘林学说的研究，并在农场做了棉花的春化试验和无性杂交试验、黄瓜无性杂交试验、绵羊杂交试验，使教师们从这实验中来体验苏联先进科学的正确性，批判过去育种问题上的资产阶级错误观点，用生动的活的事实，打消了许多教师对苏联教材的怀疑态度。五，总结经验，提高认识。该院曾在一个学期终了时总结了吸取苏联教材的四点体会，组织教师们学习，提高了教师们对吸取苏联教材的认识和信心。
    第二是解决吸取苏联教材过程中的具体困难。在教师们克服了怀疑态度，认识了苏联教材的优越性，并积极吸取苏联教材后，便遇到了许多困难。该院便紧接着采取以下办法，使教师们领会苏联教材的精神和实质：一、提高教师的理论、科学水平。教师们对苏联教材中许多问题不能理解，是由于他们存在着形而上学的观点与方法和科学技术水平的低下。例如一位教师对作物退化问题，曾这样提出：“马铃薯由凉爽的北方移植到炎热的南方，就不能满足其遗传性的要求，因此就要退化，但作物如果长期生长在同一环境条件下，也要退化，这两种矛盾的情况怎样解释，怎样才能不退化？”经过反复的对照分析研究，使教师们懂得了用形而上学的观点，把两种情况机械地从形式上对立起来，是不能解释上述矛盾情况的，而用米丘林的“生物与环境统一”的学说，便能辩证地理解这个矛盾，即：马铃薯在南方要退化，是环境条件超过其遗传性可能适应的范围；而长期生长在相同的环境条件下，使其遗传性愈保守，适应性愈缩小，也必然要退化。由于提高了教师们的理论、科学水平，也就提高了他们对苏联教材的理解能力。二、通过调查、研究、实验和实际联系的方法，印证苏联教材的科学根据。例如蔬菜学教师曾访问武功县的菜农，他发现菜农用变温处理西瓜种子，并用丛状播种的栽培方法，获得了高额丰产，和苏联先进经验不谋而合。果树学教师也曾到干县观察山区果树情况，发现“山上育苗、山上栽树”，可以使果树具有抗旱性，这和米丘林“斯巴达”式的驯化方法是完全
  一样的。这就使教师们进一步信任了苏联先进科学。三、补习俄文。在初期吸取苏联教材时，有一个很大的困难，就是多数教师不懂俄文，该院便组织专业俄文速成学习，使多数教师能直接地多方面地阅读俄文专业书籍与参考书。
    第三是求得苏联教材与中国实际相合。该院曾着重利用根据苏联先进科学指导我国农业生产的实际经验，来充实教材的内容，例如中央人民政府所颁布的许多农业技术措施，都是在苏联专家的指导下根据苏联先进经验结合我国实际情况提出的，是很有价值的教材，该院实习农场也由于采用了苏联教材中的先进理论而获得了小麦、棉花的丰产和畜牧生产量的提高，例如采用苏联浅、深浅的耕作制度，密植、分层、分期施肥、按地温提早棉花播种等方法，使小麦大面积每亩产量高于当地产量百分之三十六，棉花大面积每亩产量高于当地产量百分之一百六十三，因而获得了陕西省麦棉丰产奖旗。这些实际材料大大提高了教学质量。三
    以上经验说明：吸取苏联教材，进行教学改革的关键在于加强政治思想领导。而在进行政治思想领导的过程中，一方面必须充分展开教师新旧思想的矛盾斗争，不断以社会主义的先进的科学理论来批判并代替资产阶级的反动的科学理论。另一方面，又必须通过实践、和风细雨地稳步前进，防止任何急躁情绪和粗暴简单的作法。因为科学家“承认共产主义所经历的途径，是要经过他在自己那门科学方面达到实际成果，例如农艺家是循着自己的途径来承认共产主义思想的，植林学家是循着自己的途径来承认共产主义思想”的。一个科学家要改变其十几年或几十年存在于自己思想中的旧观点，不是一件容易的事，这是一件长期的、艰苦的，复杂曲折的思想改造和实践过程。西北农学院有一位教师，在他没有经过自己切身经验来认识米丘林学说以前，总认为米丘林的学说不见得正确，后来他试用米丘林方法把湖南大冬瓜和本地缩面南瓜的混合花粉进行花粉教养，两年来培育成六十多斤的大冬瓜，其重量高出本地品种两三倍，他这才信服地说：“我们过去不懂米丘林学说，偏说米丘林学说不正确，今天看起来，那是我们无知，并不是米丘林学说不正确。”他从自己的实践中，认识到只有苏联的先进科学，才能正确地说明世界、改造世界。这样，就提高了吸取苏联教材的自觉性和积极性。
    应该着重指出，这是西北农学院进行教学改革中的一个重要的经验。
