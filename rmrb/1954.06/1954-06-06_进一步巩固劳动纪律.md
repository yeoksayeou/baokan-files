    Further Consolidate Labor Discipline

    Over the past few years, the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers has greatly increased, and as a result, labor discipline has been continuously consolidated. However, even today, some workers still exhibit phenomena that undermine labor discipline, such as absenteeism, loafing, disobedience to commands and dispatching, and failure to comply with operating procedures and safety regulations. This affects the normal operation of production in some enterprises, resulting in low product quality, many defective products, and frequent accidents. Enterprise plans cannot be completed well, causing undue losses to the people. According to statistics from the five central industrial ministries for ten months last year, work stoppages due to accidents amounted to more than 2.3 million workdays, equivalent to approximately 7,000 people not working for a year. The losses brought to production by this situation are self-evident. Among these accidents, 80% to 90% are directly caused by violations of operating procedures and safety regulations, which is the result of lax enforcement of labor discipline. Therefore, strengthening labor discipline is extremely necessary to rectify the current enterprise management and improve the current production situation.

    Continuously consolidating labor discipline within the working class is an extremely important task to ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction. With the ever-expanding national economic construction and the increasing thoroughness and completeness of national plans, every enterprise and every worker must strengthen labor organization and labor discipline to accurately, evenly, and comprehensively complete national plans. Failure to complete the plan of any enterprise will affect the realization of the entire plan. In enterprises, as the requirements for product quality increase, and as new equipment is continuously added and old equipment is renovated, technical requirements become stricter and production tasks become more arduous. Strict adherence to technical operating procedures and ensuring safe production are also more important and complex than in the past. Improving enterprise production management requires the strictest labor discipline in enterprises to ensure that hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of people can effectively work under unified command.

    To consolidate labor discipline, in addition to continuously strengthening daily political and ideological education, it is necessary to establish some necessary systems. Only by correctly combining these two aspects can we make the working class a highly disciplined force. In the past few years, various industrial departments in our country have been busy with the democratic reform of enterprises and the restoration of production, and have not yet accumulated much experience on how to correctly organize enterprise labor. Therefore, it has not been possible to immediately formulate a sound system to consolidate labor discipline. This situation must be changed today. Labor discipline must be fixed in the form of law. As Lenin said in "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government": "We must consolidate what we have already won, what we have already decreed, what we have already regulated, what we have already discussed, what we have already drafted—we must consolidate all this into stable forms of everyday labor discipline. This is the most difficult, yet the most fruitful task, because only by solving this task can we establish socialist order. We must learn to combine the surging democratic spirit of the working masses holding mass meetings, which sweeps away all barriers like a spring tide, with the iron discipline in working hours and the absolute subordination to the will of a single leader of the Soviets in work." Today, such a task is before us, and this is precisely the urgent demand of the broad masses of workers. After conducting labor discipline education in various places last year, many enterprises have formulated rules and systems for labor discipline. At present, it is very necessary to form a complete set of rules based on these experiences, plus the many valuable experiences that have been accumulated in the past, to meet future needs.

    Within state-owned enterprises, there must be specific regulations and specific education regarding the recruitment, transfer, and dismissal of employees, the basic responsibilities of employees, working hours, and the penalties for those who violate labor discipline. Only in this way can we guarantee and consolidate labor discipline within state-owned enterprises, correctly organize labor, fully and rationally utilize working hours, increase labor productivity, continuously increase the quantity and improve the quality of products, reduce product costs, and complete and overfulfill state plans. Strict compliance with internal labor rules should become the sacred obligation of all workers, engineering and technical personnel, and staff members.

    Some comrades have a misunderstanding about the issue of labor discipline. They often regard labor rules as negative provisions that restrict workers, believing that strict and specific labor rules in enterprises will limit the enthusiasm of the masses of workers. Therefore, they do not establish strict labor discipline in enterprises, and they are perfunctory about various accidents, large and small, that violate and undermine labor discipline, failing to conduct serious investigations and handling of the matter.

    Some people even mistakenly view the enforcement of labor discipline as a warlord style and an act of commandism, and therefore are hesitant and dare not resolutely enforce discipline. As a result, labor discipline is lax, the state's production is harmed, the enthusiasm of the masses cannot be brought into play, and even individual bad elements take advantage of the loopholes. Obviously, this view and practice are extremely wrong and harmful. It should be understood that what threatens the normal progress of production and affects the labor enthusiasm of the masses in enterprises today is not that the discipline is too strict, but that the discipline is too lax.

    Labor discipline is the most powerful weapon to correctly guide workers in production, organize and promote the labor enthusiasm and initiative of the masses of workers. Correctly implementing labor discipline will surely further stimulate the labor enthusiasm of the masses of workers and promote the development of enterprise production. Of course, labor discipline must have its limitations and constraints, but what it limits are only those phenomena that harm production and undermine discipline. Giving strict limitations to these phenomena is beneficial to the country and to the broad masses of workers in enterprises, and is welcomed by the majority of workers. All state-owned enterprise departments should not hesitate to vigorously rectify labor discipline, strengthen the concept of abiding by the law and discipline. First, it is necessary to strengthen the concept of law and discipline among leading cadres at all levels of enterprises' Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations, as well as among Communist Party members in enterprises. To make all employees abide by the law and discipline, it is necessary to start with these people, and these people should be required to first become models of strictly abiding by enterprise labor discipline.

    It must also be pointed out that any view that deals with things by administrative orders and disciplinary sanctions is also wrong. Our labor discipline is a conscious discipline built on the basis of the complete consistency between the interests of the state and the interests of the workers, and consolidating labor discipline is a long-term and arduous process of communist education. Therefore, education and persuasion are always and must be the most fundamental methods for consolidating labor discipline. Even if penalties are given to those who violate discipline, the positive purpose is also to educate themselves and the broad masses of workers, in the spirit of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing the sickness to save the patient." Therefore, we must strictly prevent the possible tendency of punitivism and prevent handling labor discipline issues in a simple and crude administrative manner. Instead, we should combine the implementation of internal labor rules with daily political and ideological education, strengthen the activities of trade union groups, and frequently carry out mutual criticism and self-criticism to continuously improve the class consciousness of workers. Only by establishing labor discipline on a conscious mass basis, that is, on the basis of democratic management and democratic supervision with everyone taking responsibility, can internal labor rules be truly implemented.

    Establishing normal labor order and consolidating labor discipline in enterprises also relies on the enterprise administration to effectively fulfill its various duties. Many facts in the past have shown that neglecting labor protection work, insufficient education on operating procedures and safety regulations for workers, untimely supply of tools, materials, and spare parts, and unreasonable labor organization are also important reasons for defects such as low attendance rates, poor product quality, many defective products, frequent accidents, and waste of labor time in enterprises. Therefore, all administrative personnel of state-owned enterprises must earnestly fulfill their responsibilities, correctly organize the labor of workers, effectively implement the production responsibility system and implement production rationalization, strictly implement relevant laws and regulations on labor protection, improve enterprise working conditions, and strengthen the education of workers on operating procedures and safety regulations.

    Various industrial departments and enterprise units should formulate labor rules that are in line with the specific conditions of their respective departments and enterprises. This is a meticulous and very important task. Each department must take this work seriously, organize all employees to carry out in-depth discussions, and make this discussion another in-depth and specific labor discipline education for the masses. On this basis, internal labor rules that meet the characteristics of the department and enterprise should be formulated. Only in this way can labor rules be understood and willingly implemented by the masses, and can they be widely supervised by the masses after implementation, and truly become the action program for the daily labor of all employees. After publicizing the general task of the state during the transition period in various places, the awareness of the broad masses of workers has greatly improved. Strengthening labor discipline, improving the labor conditions in enterprises, and working better for socialist construction are precisely their universal demands. As long as we can earnestly unite the broad masses of workers, improve their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility, labor discipline will surely be further strengthened, and the production order of enterprises will surely be better established.

### 进一步巩固劳动纪律

    进一步巩固劳动纪律
    几年来，广大职工的劳动积极性大大提高，因而劳动纪律是不断地得到巩固，但是至今在一部分职工中，也还存在着旷工、怠工、不服从指挥调度、不遵守操作规程和保安规程等破坏劳动纪律的现象，以致影响有的企业的生产不能正常进行，产品质量低、废品多和事故多，企业计划不能很好完成，造成了对人民的不应有的损失。据中央五个工业部去年十个月的统计，因事故停工达二百三十多万个工作日，约等于七千人一年没有工作，这种情况给生产所带来的损失，是不言而喻的。在这些事故中，百分之八十到九十都是直接违反操作规程和保安规程所造成，也就是由于劳动纪律执行不严的结果。所以，加强劳动纪律，对整顿目前企业管理，改进生产现状来说，是极为必要的。
    不断地巩固工人阶级内部的劳动纪律，是保证社会主义建设事业顺利进行的一项极为重要的工作。随着国家经济建设事业的日益扩大，国家计划一天天地周密和完备了，每一个企业和每一个职工，都必须加强劳动组织和劳动纪律，准确地均衡地全面完成国家计划，那一个企业的计划不能完成，就会影响整个计划的实现。在企业中，随着产品质量要求的提高以及新设备的陆续增加和旧设备的改造，技术要求更加严格了，生产任务更加繁重了，一丝不苟地执行技术操作规程和保证安全生产，也比过去重要得多和复杂得多了。企业生产管理工作的改进，要求企业中必须有最严格的劳动纪律，保证企业中几百人以至几千人几万人在统一的指挥下有效地进行劳动。
    要巩固劳动纪律，除了不断加强日常的政治思想教育工作以外，必须建立一些必要的制度。这两方面的正确结合，才能使工人阶级成为一支具有高度纪律性的队伍。过去几年中，我国各工业部门因为忙于企业的民主改革和生产的恢复工作，如何正确组织企业劳动又还没有积累很多经验，因此没有可能立即制定一套健全的制度，以巩固劳动纪律。这种情况，在今天必须有所改变了。必须把劳动纪律用法律的形式固定下来。正如列宁在“苏维埃政权底当前任务”中所说：“必须把我们所业已夺得的东西，把我们所已经下过明令，已经定为法规，已经讨论过，已经拟定了的东西巩固起来，——必须把这些东西巩固成为日常劳动纪律底坚固形式。这是一个最困难而又最有成果的任务，因为只有解决这个任务，我们才能树立起社会主义的秩序。应该学会将劳动群众举行群众大会的这种汹涌澎湃有如春潮泛滥一切堤障的民主精神，与在工作时间内实行铁的纪律，及在工作中绝对服从苏维埃领导者一个人意志的精神联成一气。”今天摆在我们面前的正是这样的一个任务，而这也正是广大职工的迫切要求。去年各地在进行了劳动纪律教育以后，许多企业制订了劳动纪律的规则和制度，目前很有必要根据这些经验，加上过去已经积累起来的许多宝贵的经验，形成一整套完备的规则，以适应今后的需要。
    在国营企业内部，对于职工的录用、调动和辞退，对于职工的基本职责，对于工作时间，以及对于违反劳动纪律者的处分等问题，都必须有具体的规定和具体的教育。才能保证和巩固国营企业内部的劳动纪律，正确地组织劳动，充分而合理地利用工作时间，提高劳动生产率，不断地增加产品的数量和提高产品的质量，降低产品的成本，完成和超额完成国家计划。严格遵守内部劳动规则，应该成为全体工人、工程技术人员和职员的神圣义务。
    有些同志对劳动纪律问题存在着一种误解，他们常常把劳动规则看作是一种消极的限制工人的条文，认为企业中的劳动规则订得太严和太具体，就会限制职工群众的积极性，因此他们不在企业中建立严格的劳动纪律，对于违反和破坏劳动纪律的各种大小事故也马马虎虎，不追根到底地进行严肃的处理。
    有些人甚至把执行劳动纪律错误地看成为军阀作风和命令主义的行为，因而束手束脚，不敢坚决执行纪律，其结果就使得劳动纪律松弛，国家生产事业受到损害，群众的积极性不能发扬，甚至给个别坏分子钻了空子。显然，这种看法和做法是极端错误的和有害的。应当知道：今天在企业中威胁着生产正常进行和影响着群众劳动积极性的，并不是纪律太严，而是纪律太松了。
    劳动纪律是正确地指导职工进行生产，组织和发扬职工群众劳动积极性和主动性的最有力武器。正确地执行劳动纪律，必能更加激发起职工群众的劳动热情和促进企业生产的发展。当然，劳动纪律必然要有它的限制和约束作用，但它所限制的，仅仅是那些危害生产的少数败坏纪律的现象，对于这些现象给予严格的限制，对国家和对企业中广大的职工，都是有利的，也是大多数职工群众所欢迎的。一切国营企业部门应该毫不犹豫地大力整顿劳动纪律，加强守法遵纪的观念，首先是要加强企业党、行政、工会、青年团等各级领导干部和企业中共产党员的法纪观念。要使全体职工守法遵纪，必须先从这些人做起，应当要求这些人首先成为严格地遵守企业劳动纪律的模范。
    也必须指出：一切以行政命令和纪律制裁来办事的观点也是错误的。我们的劳动纪律是建筑在国家利益和职工利益完全一致的基础上的自觉纪律，而巩固劳动纪律是一个长期的艰巨的共产主义教育的过程，因而教育和说服始终是也必须是巩固劳动纪律最根本的方法。即使对违犯纪律者给以处分，其积极目的也是为了教育其本人及广大职工，应本着“惩前毖后，治病救人”的精神。因此，我们必须严格防止可能发生的惩办主义的倾向，防止以简单粗暴的行政方式来处理劳动纪律问题，而应当把执行内部劳动规则和日常的政治思想教育工作结合起来进行，加强工会小组的活动，经常地开展相互间的批评和自我批评，不断地提高职工的阶级觉悟。只有把劳动纪律建立在自觉的群众的基础上，也就是建立在大家负责的民主管理、民主监督的基础之上，内部劳动规则才能真正地得到贯彻。
    企业中要建立正常的劳动秩序和巩固的劳动纪律，还有赖于企业行政上切实履行自己的各项职务。过去许多事实说明：由于行政上忽视劳动保护工作，对职工操作规程和保安规程的教育不够，工具、材料、备用品等供应不及时，劳动组织不合理等等，也是造成企业中出勤率低，产品质量坏、废品多、事故多和劳动时间浪费等缺陷的重要原因之一，因此，所有国营企业的行政人员必须认真履行自己的职责，正确地组织职工的劳动，切实贯彻生产责任制和实行生产合理化，严格执行有关劳动保护的法令和规定，改善企业作业条件，加强对职工进行操作规程和保安规程的教育。
    各工业部门和企业单位应该结合本企业的具体情况，制定切合本部门和本企业的劳动规则。这是一件细致的同时又很重要的工作，各部门必须认真对待这一工作，组织全体职工展开深入的讨论，使这种讨论成为对群众的又一次深入具体的劳动纪律教育，并在这一基础上制订出符合本部门本企业特点的内部劳动规则。只有这样，劳动规则才能为群众所了解并乐于执行，才能在实行之后取得群众的广泛监督，真正成为全体职工日常劳动的行动纲领。各地在宣传了国家过渡时期的总任务后，广大职工的觉悟程度大为提高，加强劳动纪律，改善企业中的劳动状况，为社会主义的建设而更好地劳动，正是他们的普遍要求。只要我们能够认真团结广大职工群众，提高他们的积极性和责任心，劳动纪律必能进一步加强，企业的生产秩序必能更好地建立起来。
