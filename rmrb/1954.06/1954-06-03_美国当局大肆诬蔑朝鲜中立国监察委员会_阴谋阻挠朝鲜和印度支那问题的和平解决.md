Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd—The U.S. Department of Defense issued a statement on May 29th, grossly slandering and defaming the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) in Korea. It also cursed and attacked the NNSC for allegedly failing to fulfill the tasks entrusted to it by the Armistice Agreement. This action by the U.S. Department of Defense is obviously part of a recent smear campaign launched by the U.S. authorities against the NNSC, aimed at obstructing and undermining the Geneva Conference.

However, the achievements and contributions of the NNSC in assisting the implementation of the Armistice Agreement and ensuring the stability of the Korean armistice cannot be obliterated by the slander of the U.S. authorities. Since the Korean armistice, the NNSC has done a great deal of work in supervising the implementation of the provisions of the Armistice Agreement related to ensuring the stability of the military armistice. The NNSC dispatched inspection teams to rear ports in North and South Korea to monitor and inspect the rotation of military personnel and the replacement of war materiel. It also promptly dispatched mobile inspection teams to conduct investigations in areas outside the Demilitarized Zone at the request of both senior members of the Military Armistice Commission, provided that they complied with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement. It is clear that the NNSC has played a significant role in assisting the implementation of the Armistice Agreement.

Admittedly, the NNSC encountered many difficulties in carrying out its work in South Korea. However, the cause of these difficulties was none other than the United States, which has consistently violated the Armistice Agreement and disrespected neutral nations. In order to bring reinforcing war materiel from outside Korea to arm the Li pseudo-army and strengthen military power, the United States has tried every means to obstruct, restrict, and interfere with the work of the NNSC, making it impossible for the NNSC to conduct effective monitoring and inspection in South Korea. This behavior by the United States has even developed into open threats and intimidation against the NNSC, and the kidnapping, beating, intimidation, and insult of NNSC personnel. Recently, the United States has even forced the NNSC inspection teams stationed in South Korea to implement its so-called "new methods" that completely violate the Armistice Agreement, placing the inspection and monitoring activities of these teams entirely under U.S. control, making them nominal. Nevertheless, in order to safeguard the NNSC's power to perform its legitimate duties, the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the NNSC have repeatedly and impartially exposed these serious violations of the Armistice Agreement by the United States, and have steadfastly adhered to the work of monitoring and inspection. It is quite obvious that it is precisely because of the existence of the NNSC and the impartial, neutral, and responsible work of the Czechoslovak and Polish members that the United States has not been able to completely import reinforcing war materiel from outside Korea at will, causing the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement relating to the NNSC to be unilaterally undermined in South Korea. Because of this, the United States has always harbored resentment against the Czechoslovak and Polish members, desperately engaging in vicious slander and defamation against them. However, this behavior by the United States, apart from exposing its own sinister intentions to violate the Armistice Agreement and its barbaric attitude of disrespecting neutral nations, cannot in the least harm the just position of the Czechoslovak and Polish members.

The facts are very clear. The purpose of the U.S. authorities in launching a smear campaign to slander the NNSC and the Czechoslovak and Polish members is to attempt to abolish the NNSC, so as to completely import a large number of military personnel and war materiel from outside Korea at will, thereby maintaining the unstable state of the Korean armistice and obstructing the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. However, it is even more noteworthy that the discussions on the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference began on May 31st with the issue of ceasefire supervision. The purpose of the U.S. authorities in intensifying this smear campaign at this time is naturally to attempt to obstruct the discussion of this issue and prevent the Indochina issue from being resolved peacefully.

### 美国当局大肆诬蔑朝鲜中立国监察委员会  阴谋阻挠朝鲜和印度支那问题的和平解决

    美国当局大肆诬蔑朝鲜中立国监察委员会
    阴谋阻挠朝鲜和印度支那问题的和平解决
   【新华社二日讯】美国国防部在五月二十九日发表了一项声明，大肆诬蔑和诽谤朝鲜中立国监察委员会的捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员，并且谩骂和攻击中立国监察委员会未曾履行停战协定所赋予它的任务。美国国防部的这个行动，显然是美国当局最近发动的诬蔑和诽谤中立国监察委员会，旨在阻挠和破坏日内瓦会议的造谣运动的一个组成部分。
    但是，中立国监察委员会对于协助停战协定的实施和保证朝鲜停战的稳定所作出的成绩和贡献，不是美国当局的造谣诽谤所能抹煞得了的。自朝鲜停战以来，中立国监察委员会对于监督停战协定中有关保证军事停战的稳定的条款的实施，做了很多的工作。中立国监察委员会派遣了视察小组分驻南、北朝鲜的后方口岸，对军事人员的轮换和作战物资的替换进行了监察和视察，并且对军事停战委员会双方首席委员提出的到非军事区以外的地区进行特别调查的要求，只要它们符合停战协定的规定，都毫不迟延地派遣机动视察小组前去进行调查。很显然，中立国监察委员会对于协助停战协定的实施是起了不少的作用的。
    诚然，中立国监察委员会在南朝鲜进行它的工作时遇到了很多的困难。但是，造成这些困难的不是别人，正是一贯恣意违反停战协定和不尊重中立国的美国。美国为了从朝鲜境外运入增援性的作战物资，以武装李伪军和增强军事力量，千方百计地对中立国监察委员会的工作进行阻挠、限制和干涉，使得中立国监察委员会无法在南朝鲜进行有效的监察和视察。美国的这种行为甚至发展到对中立国监察委员会公开进行威胁和恫吓，对中立国人员进行绑架、殴打、威吓和侮辱。最近，美国更强制驻南朝鲜的中立国视察小组执行它的完全违反停战协定的所谓“新办法”，使这些小组的视察和监察活动完全处于美国的控制之下而变成有名无实。但是，尽管如此，中立国监察委员会捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员为了维护中立国监察委员会的执行合法职司的权力，一再公正无私地揭露了美国的这种严重违反停战协定的行为，并且始终不渝地坚持了监察和视察的工作。十分明显，正是由于中立国监察委员会的存在，以及捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员的公正无私、信守中立、积极负责的工作，美国才不能完全放手地从朝鲜境外运入增援性作战物资，使朝鲜停战协定中有关中立国监察委员会的条款在南朝鲜遭到片面破坏。正因为如此，美国对捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员一直怀恨在心，拚命地对他们进行恶毒的诬蔑和诽谤。但是，美国的这种行为，除了暴露它自己违反停战协定的罪恶用心，以及不尊重中立国的横蛮态度以外，一点也不能损害捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员的公正立场。
    事实十分清楚，美国当局在最近发动诬蔑和诽谤中立国监察委员会以及捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员的造谣运动，其目的之一是企图取消中立国监察委员会，以便完全放手地从朝鲜境外运入大批军事人员和作战物资，从而保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。但是，更值得注意的是，日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的讨论已在五月三十一日开始讨论关于停战的监督问题。美国当局选择这个时间加紧进行这个造谣运动，其目的自然是企图阻挠这个问题的讨论，使印度支那问题得不到和平解决。
