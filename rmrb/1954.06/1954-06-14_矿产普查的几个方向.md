In order to find more mineral bases to meet the needs of national economic construction; in order to comprehensively and holistically understand China's underground mineral resources, and to provide resource information for the rational distribution of China's industry, the Ministry of Geology will launch a large-scale national mineral prospecting work from 1954. This is a long-term, comprehensive work that relies on the support and cooperation of the masses. It is not only a foundation for one Five-Year Plan, but also for several Five-Year Plans; it is an important work for the most basic national geological map compilation in geological work, as well as for creating more conditions for improving theoretical levels and studying ore deposit laws.

At the Ministry of Geology's prospecting work conference, it was decided that this year's mineral prospecting work would basically adopt the methods of "finding minerals near existing mines" and "combining points and areas." What does "finding minerals near existing mines" mean? It means arranging mineral prospecting work in the vicinity of known mining areas that were mined in ancient times, or have been producing and are still producing in recent years. In these areas, some may already be filled with old tunnels and piles of slag, with the saying "old tunnels and empty mountains," but ancient mining was greatly limited by technical conditions, mainly the lack of water pumping and ventilation equipment, often unable to enter the depths. Therefore, in old mining areas, if we find locations with definite prospects, we can use the latest technical equipment to reach places that predecessors have never exploited, and mine enriched ore deposits below the water table. Moreover, with ore dressing equipment, we can also exploit low-grade ore deposits that predecessors could not utilize but have huge reserves. Such ore deposits are also objects that modern mining should pay attention to developing. Therefore, it is not difficult to find important ore deposits with industrial value by carefully searching in the vicinity and depths of new and old mining areas.

From another perspective, the formation of most ore deposits is not an accidental or local phenomenon, but has certain causes and a relatively wide distribution. This is true for layered ore deposits such as coal mines and sedimentary iron ore, as well as for many metal ore deposits formed by igneous rock activity. It is only due to subsequent changes, such as folding, faulting, weathering, erosion, and burial, that the originally continuous or intermittently connected mining areas have become fragmented and irregular. Precisely because of this, whether ancient or recent miners often only grasped a part of the entire mining area, or even the smallest and weakest link, to work carefully, while neglecting other larger and more important parts. Therefore, conducting mineral prospecting in the vicinity of known mining areas, especially within the range of possible distribution inferred based on geological theory, will be an effective method. This is the basic reason for the "finding minerals near existing mines" method set by the Ministry of Geology for this year's mineral prospecting.

What does "combining points and areas" mean? "Combining points and areas" has two aspects: one is "connecting points into areas," and the other is "finding points within areas." As mentioned above, we want to conduct mineral prospecting within the range of possible distribution inferred based on geological theory. However, how can we accurately predict this range today, when the national geological map has not been completed and geological data is still scarce? This requires collecting information from multiple sources. China is a country with a long cultural history, and mining began very early. The ancients had considerable skills in recognizing ores. Therefore, in many areas, all easily recognizable ores, mainly coal and various common metal minerals and significant outcrops, have been initially excavated by the ancients, and later explored and mined repeatedly. In the reports written by Chinese geologists in the past, there are often records of such new and old mining sites. Recent mass mineral reports have also reflected a lot of mineral information. Connecting these known old and new mines and mass mineral reporting points can form an area. Then, study and select this area from the perspectives of available geological data, ore deposits, structure, and transportation conditions to determine whether it is worth working on. Finally, take many selected areas as the objects of our mineral prospecting, which ensures that the prospecting areas are based on certain grounds and are not limited to a corner. This is called "connecting points into areas."

However, the purpose of mineral prospecting is to find promising points for exploration. In a vast area, many points are often worthless, and only a few points are worth further exploration. Therefore, we must gradually surround and narrow down the scope based on field observations and geological theory, find several key points in the vast area, and delineate a range around the key points for further detailed surveys or exploration. This is called "finding points within areas." Combining the meanings of connecting points into areas and finding points within areas is "combining points and areas."

In order to solve the various mineral resources urgently required by China's first Five-Year Plan, the methods of "finding minerals near existing mines" and "combining points and areas" are the most effective methods of prospecting work that can quickly solve the problems. However, this method is not the only method for mineral prospecting. There are many minerals that China has never mined in ancient times; there are many minerals (mostly non-metallic minerals such as aluminum ore and phosphate ore) that are unremarkable, neither heavy nor shiny, and easily overlooked, making it difficult to find clues in mass mineral reporting; and there are many minerals buried under the cover layer, which cannot be discovered on the surface. In these areas, we cannot find points in our data. Without points, we cannot connect them into areas, let alone find key points in the area. This requires us to widely point out potentially mineral-bearing or more promising areas on the geological map based on many principles of geology, mineralogy, petrology, structural geology, and ore deposit geology; at the same time, cooperate with geophysical or geochemical methods to delineate more specific and narrower areas for drilling or trenching, and finally find the minerals. Since mineral prospecting is a long-term and comprehensive work, and since tracing the clues of outcrops or old kilns will gradually decrease, the mineral prospecting method mainly based on academic research, including the deep mineral finding method recently proposed by Soviet experts, is an important aspect of mineral prospecting in the future.

It is entirely possible and necessary to conduct mineral prospecting mainly based on academic principles. China needs abundant potash salt mines to ensure agricultural development, but except for trace amounts of potash salt in the brine of several salt wells in Sichuan, true potash salt strata have not yet been discovered. According to the theory of ore deposit geology, potash salt is the product of the final evaporation from salt water mother liquor, and the general sequence of strata from bottom to top is dolomite, gypsum, halite, and potash salt. The formation of potash salt is in line with the period of marine regression. In addition to a suitable climate, there must be special topographic conditions, such as bays, shallow seas, or a series of lagoons enclosed by sandbars. Without these suitable conditions, it is impossible to complete almost all the evaporation, let alone form thicker, high-grade potash salt strata. From these theories, combined with China's geological conditions, we can first point out that the Ordovician in the north and the end of the Triassic in the south were both marine regression periods, and the climatic conditions were quite suitable, which are ideal periods for the formation of salt mineral deposits. Secondly, according to the situation of paleogeography and some facts that have been discovered of gypsum, halite, and a small amount of potash salt and bromine salt, we can point out some areas as ideal objects for finding potash salt mines in the future.

For example, according to the principles of geotectonics and sedimentary facies, we speculate that the Huainan coalfield and another coalfield in a certain place belong to one or several intermittently connected sedimentary basins. In the vast plain between these two coalfields, there may be one or several huge coalfields hidden, which is worth paying attention to.

The above are several directions for mineral prospecting in the future. Due to the urgent needs of national construction at present, and in order to make full use of the known data in the past, we must now put the methods of "finding minerals near existing mines" and "combining points and areas" in the first place, but in the future, the mineral finding direction mainly based on theoretical research will become increasingly important. Mineral prospecting is a long-term, comprehensive, meticulous, and complex work, which could only be regarded as a fantasy in the past, but today, it has gradually become a reality. Let us closely combine theory and practice to provide more mineral resources for the country's socialist industrialization.

    矿产普查的几个方向
    中央地质部地质矿产司总工程师　谢家荣
    为了找出更多的矿产基地，满足国家经济建设的需要；为了全面地综合地了解我国地下的矿产资源，为我国工业的合理分布提供资源上的资料，中央地质部从一九五四年起将开展大规模的全国矿产普查工作。这是一种长期性的综合性的并且要依靠群众力量支援合作的工作。它不止是为一个五年计划，而且是为好几个五年计划打基础的工作；是为地质工作中最基本的全国地质图的测制以及为提高理论水平，研究矿床规律创造更多条件的重要工作。
    中央地质部普查工作会议上，决定今年矿产普查工作基本上采取“就矿找矿”“点面结合”的方法。什么叫做就矿找矿呢？这就是在古代曾经开过矿的或近年来生产过及还在生产的已知矿区的附近，布置矿产普查工作。这些地区中，固然有些已经是老硐遍布，矿渣累累，有“硐老山空”之说，但古代开矿，受技术条件的限制很大，主要是没有抽水和通风设备，往往不能进入深处。所以在老矿区内，如果找到了确有远景的地点，我们就可以用最新技术设备，达到前人未经开过的地方，去开采在潜水面以下的富集矿床；而且由于有了选矿设备，我们还可以去开采前人无法利用的品位较低但是矿量十分巨大的低级矿床，这种矿床也是现代矿业应注意开发的对象。因此，在新旧矿区的附近和其深处，仔细搜觅，不难找到有工业价值的重要矿床。
    从另一方面看，大多数矿床的造成，都不是偶然的局部的现象，而有一定的原因和相当广泛的分布。成层的矿床如煤矿、水成铁矿固然如此，火成岩作用所成的许多金属矿床，也是如此。只是由于后来的变化，如褶皱、断裂、风化、冲刷、掩盖等等，常使本来是连续的或是断续相连的矿区，变成支离散漫毫无规则的局面。正因为如此，不论是古代的或是最近的采矿者，往往只抓住了整个矿区中的一部分，甚至是其中最微小最薄弱的一环，去精工细作，却遗漏了其他更大更重要的部分。因此，在已知矿地的附近，尤其在基于地质理论所推测的可能分布的范围内去进行矿产普查，将是一个有效的方法。这就是地质部本年所定矿产普查方法中
  “就矿找矿”的基本理由。
    什么叫“点面结合”呢？“点面结合”分两个方面，一方面是“连点成面”，一方面是“就面找点”。上面已经说过，我们要在就地质理论所推测的可能分布范围内去进行矿产普查。但在全国地质图还没有完成，地质资料还很贫乏的今天，如何能很准确地去推测这个范围呢？这就需要多方面的搜集资料。我国是个有悠久文化历史的国家，很早以前就开始探矿，古人对于矿石的认识，原有相当本领，因此在许多地区，凡是容易认识的矿石，主要是煤和各种普通的金属矿物及显著的露头，很多都由古人初步开挖过，后来又经三番五次的探采。已往中国地质学者所著的报告中，常有关于这种新旧矿产地的记载，最近的群众报矿，又反映了许多矿产资料，把这些已知的老矿新矿和群众报矿的点连起来，就能成为一个面，再把这个面从已有地质资料，从矿床、构造及交通条件等方面加以研究选择，决定是否值得进行工作，最后把许多选定的面，作为我们进行矿产普查的对象，这样就保证了普查地区是有一定根据的，又不致于局限于一隅。这就叫做“连点成面”。
    但是矿产普查的目的是要找出有希望的点，以便进行勘探。而在广大的面中，有许多点往往是没有价值的，只有少数的点，才值得进一步勘探。因此我们要依据实地观察和地质理论，逐步包围，逐步缩小，在广大的面积中找出若干重点，并在重点的四周圈定范围，进行次一步的详测或勘探。这叫做“就面找点”。把连点成面及就面找点的意义合起来讲，就是“点面结合”。
    为了解决我国第一个五年计划所急迫要求的各项矿产资源，“就矿找矿”、“点面结合”的方法，是最能迅速解决问题的普查工作的有效方法。但这种方法并不是矿产普查的唯一方法。有许多矿，我国古代从未开采；有许多矿（大多数是非金属矿如铝矿、磷矿等），由于矿石平淡无奇，既不重也不发亮，容易被人忽视，在群众报矿中很难找到线索；更有许多矿埋覆于盖层之下，在地面上无法发现。这些地区，在我们的资料中是找不到点的。既没有点，就连不起面，更谈不到在面中找出重点。这就必须依据地质学、矿物学、岩石学、构造地质学及矿床学上的许多道理，在地质图上广泛地指出可能含矿或较有希望的区域来进行矿产普查；同时配合地球物理或地球化学的方法，划出更具体更为狭小的面积，进行钻探或坑探，最后才能把矿探出来。由于矿产普查工作是一种长期性、综合性的工作，又由于追踪露头或老窑的线索，将会逐渐减少，因此以学理研究为主要根据的矿产普查法，包括苏联专家最近提出的深处找矿法，是今后矿产普查中一个重要的方面。
    以学理为主要根据，进行矿产普查是完全可能和必要的。我国需要有丰富的钾盐矿，以保证农业的发展，但除四川若干盐井的卤水中有微量钾盐外，真正的钾盐矿层，至今尚未发现。依据矿床学上的理论，钾盐是从盐水母液中最后蒸发出来的产物，地层中一般自下而上的层序是白云岩、石膏、石盐及钾盐。钾盐的造成，都与海退时期相符合，除合适的气候外，更须有地形上的特殊条件，如为沙堤所封闭的海湾，浅海或一系列的泻湖等等，没有这些合适的条件就不能完成几乎全部的蒸发，更不能形成较厚的、品位高的钾盐矿层。从这些理论，结合中国地质情况，我们首先就可指出北方奥陶纪及南方的三叠纪末期俱是海退期，气候条件亦颇适合，为造成盐类矿床的理想时期。其次根据古地理的情况，及一些已经发现石膏，石盐，和少量钾盐溴盐的事实，我们就可以指出一些区域，作为今后找寻钾盐矿的理想对象。
    再如根据大地构造和沉积型相的道理，我们推想淮南煤田与某处另一煤田同属一个或几个断续相连的沉积盆地，在这两个煤田间的广大平原内，可能隐伏着一个或数个巨大的煤田，这是值得引起注意的。
    以上是今后矿产普查的几个方向。由于目前国家建设的急迫需要，以及为了充分利用过去已知的资料，我们现在就必须把“就矿找矿”“点面结合”的方法列在第一位，但在今后，以理论研究为主的找矿方向，将会日臻重要起来。矿产普查是一个长期性的、综合性的细致复杂的工作，在过去只能当作一种幻想，但在今天，已经逐步成为事实了。让我们把理论与实践密切地结合起来，为国家的社会主义工业化提供更多的矿产资源。
