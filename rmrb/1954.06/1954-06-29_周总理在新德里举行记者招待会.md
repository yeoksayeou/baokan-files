Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 28th: Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China held a press conference at the Presidential Palace in New Delhi at 6:00 PM on the 27th.

Premier Zhou Enlai read a written statement to the Indian and foreign journalists present and answered questions submitted by reporters in advance. The written statement read by Premier Zhou Enlai is as follows:

I. Some reporters asked me for positive suggestions on easing international tensions.

I believe that opposing war and maintaining peace are the main ways to ease international tensions. The Korean armistice has eased international tensions one step further. If the war in Indochina can be stopped and peace in Indochina can be restored, international tensions will be further eased. However, we should not ignore that some people are still hindering the belligerent parties in Indochina from reaching an honorable armistice. Therefore, peace-loving countries and people should continue to work hard so that such obstruction activities cannot succeed.

II. Some reporters asked me for positive suggestions on increasing cooperation among Asian countries.

I believe that the five principles stipulated in the preamble to the Sino-Indian Agreement on Trade and Traffic between the Tibet region of China and India, signed in April this year, as Prime Minister Nehru said, should become the norm for Sino-Indian relations. These principles are mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. These principles are not only applicable to our two countries, but also to other countries in Asia and to all countries in the world. If these principles are applied on a larger scale in Asia, the danger of war will be reduced and the possibility of cooperation among Asian countries will be expanded.

III. Some say that countries in the world are of different sizes and strengths, how can they coexist peacefully.

We believe that according to the five principles I mentioned in my answer to the second question, countries in the world, regardless of size or strength, regardless of their social systems, can coexist peacefully. The national independence and autonomy rights of the people of all countries must be respected. The people of all countries should have the right to choose their national system and way of life and should not be interfered with by other countries. Revolution cannot be exported; at the same time, the common will expressed by the people in a country should not be subject to foreign interference. If all countries in the world handle their relations with each other based on these principles, then there will be no threat or aggression of one country against another, and the possibility of peaceful coexistence among all countries in the world will become a reality.

IV. Some ask whether the prime ministers of major Asian countries should meet from time to time in order to seek common measures to maintain peace and security in Asia.

I believe that it is appropriate for the appropriate responsible personnel of major Asian countries to meet and consult with each other from time to time in order to seek common measures to maintain peace and security in Asia.

V. Many reporters raised questions about strengthening Sino-Indian relations.

I believe that to strengthen and develop relations between China and India, efforts must be made in many ways. China and India have a traditional friendship of two thousand years, and recently, based on the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, they signed an agreement on trade and traffic between the Tibet region of China and India. This provides a new foundation for strengthening and developing relations between the two countries. On this new foundation, close cooperation and frequent contact between the governments and peoples of the two countries in the cause of world peace, the development of economic relations and cultural exchanges between the two countries, can continuously strengthen and develop the relations between the two countries.

Some say that the current trade volume between the two countries is small. I believe that, according to the spirit of mutual exchange and mutual assistance and the principle of equality and mutual benefit, ways can be found to expand the trade volume in this regard.

VI. Many reporters are interested in the talks between Prime Minister Nehru and me in the past few days. I would like to tell you that Prime Minister Nehru and I will soon issue a joint statement on our talks. I believe that our talks in the past few days will help the development of peace in Asia and the world.

### 周总理在新德里举行记者招待会

    周总理在新德里举行记者招待会
    【新华社新德里二十八日电】中华人民共和国中央人民政府政务院总理周恩来二十七日下午六时在新德里总统府举行记者招待会。
    周恩来总理向到会的印度和各外国记者宣读了书面谈话，回答了记者们在事前提出的问题。周恩来总理宣读的书面谈话如下：
    一、有些记者问我对于缓和国际紧张局势有何积极的建议。
    我觉得，反对战争、维护和平是缓和国际紧张局势的主要办法。朝鲜的停战使国际紧张局势缓和了一步。如果印度支那的战争能够停止，印度支那的和平能够恢复，国际紧张局势将能得到进一步的缓和。但是，我们不应忽视仍有人在阻挠印度支那交战双方达成光荣的停战。因此，爱好和平的国家和人民应该继续努力，使这种阻挠活动不能得逞。
    二、又有些记者问我对于增加亚洲国家间的合作有什么积极的建议。
    我认为，今年四月间中印两国所签订的关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定的序言上规定的五项原则，正如尼赫鲁总理所说的，应该成为中印两国关系的轨范。这些原则就是两国互相尊重领土主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互惠，和平共处。这些原则，不仅对我们两国适用，而且对于亚洲的其他国家以及对世界一切国家都能适用。如果这些原则在亚洲更大的范围内适用了，那么，战争的危险便会减少，亚洲国家合作的可能便会扩大。
    三、有人说，世界上的国家有大有小，有强有弱，如何能和平共处。
    我们认为，根据我刚才答复第二个问题时所提到的五项原则，世界各国不分大小强弱，不论其社会制度如何，是可以和平共处的。各国人民的民族独立和自主权利是必须得到尊重的。各国人民都应该有选择其国家制度和生活方式的权利，不应受到其他国家的干涉。革命是不能输出的；同时，一个国家内人民表现的共同意志也不应容许外来干涉。如果世界各国都根据这些原则处理他们相互间的关系，那么，这一国家对那一国家进行威胁和侵略的情况就不会发生，世界各国和平共处的可能，就会变成现实。
    四、有人问，为了寻求维持亚洲和平和安全的共同措施，亚洲主要国家的总理是否应该有时会晤。
    我认为，为了寻求维持亚洲和平与安全的共同措施，亚洲主要国家的适当的负责人员彼此之间有时会晤进行协商是适宜的。
    五、有许多记者提出了关于加强中印两国关系的问题。
    我认为，要加强并发展中印两国间的关系，必须从多方面来努力。中印两国之间有着两千年的传统友谊，最近又根据两国互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互惠、和平共处的原则，签订了关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定。这就为加强并发展两国的关系提供了新的基础。在这新的基础之上，两国政府和人民在世界和平事业上的密切合作和经常接触，两国经济关系的发展和文化的交流，就能够使两国间的关系获得不断的加强和发展。
    有人说目前两国间的贸易额较小。我认为，根据两国互通有无、互相帮助的精神和平等互利原则，在这方面是可以找到扩大贸易额的办法的。
    六、许多记者对于这几天来尼赫鲁总理和我的会谈感到兴趣。我愿告诉诸位，尼赫鲁总理和我关于我们的会谈即将发表一个联合声明。我相信，我们这几天来的会谈是有助于亚洲及世界和平事业的发展的。
