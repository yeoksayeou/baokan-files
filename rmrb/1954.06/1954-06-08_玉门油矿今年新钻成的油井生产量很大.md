Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, 7th. Workers at the Yumen Oilfield drilling production wells had completed one-third of their annual drilling plan by the end of May. The newly drilled wells have all been handed over to the oil extraction workers for production. The engineering quality of these new wells is good. As soon as they are put into production, they can all produce crude oil by natural flow, and they have become high-yield oil wells in production. According to statistics from the Yumen Mining Bureau's Oil Production Department, the output of new oil wells accounted for one-third of all crude oil extracted in May. The daily output of one new oil well is one to three times higher than that of old wells.

Drilling workers are continuing to drill rapidly according to the planned schedule. They will drill all new oil wells before the third quarter of this year. Judging from the current situation, more than half of the annual number of newly drilled oil wells can be completed in June.

Drilling production oil wells is one of the main projects of the Yumen Mining Bureau this year. Part of the crude oil needed by the Mining Bureau's refinery and the crude oil needed for eastward transportation will be extracted from these newly drilled oil wells. Therefore, the drilling engineering department attaches great importance to this task, and the number of drilling rigs dispatched to drill new oil wells accounts for half of the existing drilling rigs in the Jiuquan Basin. The drilling workers broke through the difficulties of wind, snow and ice as early as the beginning of the year, and drilled rapidly into the oil layer day and night. Among them, the Tian Wenkuan drilling team, which excellently completed the drilling plan, had completed three new oil wells by May and has now started drilling the fourth new oil well. Other departments also cooperated well with the new oil well drilling project. Workers from the civil engineering team promptly leveled the well site and repaired the roads. Automobile transport workers transported drilling rigs, drilling tools, oil pipes, and "Christmas trees" for sealing wellheads to the site through winding mountain roads. Workers at the machinery factory rushed to manufacture lightweight derricks for oil well production. Workers from the installation engineering team built new oil selection stations as needed by the new oil wells and laid oil pipelines. After receiving the new oil wells, the oil production workers guarded the oil wells as if they were newborn babies, sometimes watching the oil spraying next to the new oil wells all night. They also accepted the suggestions of Soviet experts to carry out systematic well testing to ensure that the new oil wells can produce more crude oil and reduce the oil-gas ratio (the ratio of oil and natural gas ejected from the oil well is reduced, that is, less natural gas is produced and more oil is produced, so that the oilfield can be protected).

    玉门油矿今年新钻成的油井生产量很大
    【新华社玉门七日电】　玉门油矿钻凿生产油井的工人到五月底已完成全年钻井计划三分之一，新钻成的油井并已全部移交给采油工人生产。这些新油井工程质量良好，一投入生产都能自喷原油，而且成了生产中的旺油井。据玉门矿务局采油处统计，五月份采出的全部原油中，新油井的产量就占到三分之一，有一口新油井的日产量，高出旧井产量一倍到三倍。
    钻井工人们继续在按照预定的计划快速地钻进着，他们要在今年第三季度以前钻完全部新油井。照目前情况看来，六月份就可完成全年新钻油井口数的一半以上。
    钻凿生产油井是玉门矿务局今年的主要工程之一，矿务局炼油厂需要的原油和东运需要的原油，有一部分要从这些新钻凿的油井中采取出来。所以钻井工程部门非常重视这个任务，派出钻凿新油井的钻机就占到酒泉盆地现有钻机的一半。钻井工人们早在年初就冲破风雪冰冻的困难，日日夜夜地向油层快速钻进。其中出色地完成钻进计划的田文宽钻井队，到五月份已钻完三口新油井，现已开始钻第四口新油井。其他各部门对于钻凿新油井工程也都配合得很好。土木建筑队的工人及时修平了井场、修通了公路。汽车运输工人把钻机、钻具、油管和装封井口的“圣诞树”等器材，通过曲曲弯弯的山地公路运送到现场。机械厂的工人赶制了油井生产时用的轻便井架。安装工程队的工人按新油井需要建成新的选油站，并铺设好输油管线。采油工人们接收新油井后，像母亲对待新生的婴儿似地，有时整夜地在新油井旁边看守着喷油。他们并接受苏联专家建议进行系统的试井工作，保证新油井既能多产原油，又能降低油气比（油井喷出的油和天然气的比例降低，即天然气出得少，油出得多，这样就可以保护油田）。
