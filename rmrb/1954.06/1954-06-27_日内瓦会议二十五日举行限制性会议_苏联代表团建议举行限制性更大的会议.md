Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 25th - The restricted meeting of the Geneva Conference discussing the restoration of peace in Indochina issued the following communique on the 25th:

"The delegations of the nine countries continued to discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina at the restricted meeting on June 25th. The next restricted meeting will be held on June 29th."

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 26th - Special correspondent reports: The delegations of the nine countries continued to discuss the issue of ceasefire supervision at the restricted meeting held on the 25th. It is reported that in order to advance the progress of the conference, the Soviet delegation put forward constructive suggestions at this meeting. The Soviet delegation proposed that the current heads of delegations, together with a small number of experts and interpreters, hold an even more restricted meeting to discuss the various proposals at the conference. This opinion of the Soviet delegation was supported by the Chinese delegation.

It is reported that the Soviet delegation pointed out at the meeting that the Soviet delegation put forward this opinion in consideration of the suggestions of the French delegation and other delegations. The French delegation suggested at the last restricted meeting that a committee of experts be established to consider "certain issues." The Soviet delegation believes that this suggestion is reasonable in principle, and the Soviet delegation is willing to review the organizational form and working procedures of the committee of experts. However, the Soviet delegation believes that it should first be decided what tasks should be given to this committee of experts. If all the work is handed over to the committee of experts, it will be regarded as a delay in the work of the conference.

In order to help better arrange the work of the conference, the Soviet delegation suggested that the current heads of delegations, together with a small number of experts and interpreters, hold a more restricted meeting to discuss in detail the various proposals of the conference. Since the twelve-point proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation on June 14th is the most detailed of the current proposals, the meeting should use this proposal as the basis for discussion, and also discuss the proposals of other delegations. The meeting should decide which issues can be agreed upon, which issues can be agreed upon in principle, and the details should be delegated to the experts for research, and then the results should be reported to the heads of the delegations. The Soviet delegation pointed out that doing so would promote the progress of the conference and draft proposals for future consideration by the foreign ministers as soon as possible.

The Soviet delegation also talked about the relationship between the Joint Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission at the meeting. The Soviet delegation pointed out that the conference had long decided that direct contact between the two parties should be promoted, and the opinion that the Joint Commission composed of both parties should be subordinate to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is contrary to this principle, and the Soviet delegation's proposition that the two organizations should be parallel and have a division of labor is based on this principle. Since the ceasefire mainly depends on the sincerity of both parties, they should not be distrusted.

It is reported that the French delegation stated at the meeting that rather than having the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission "override" the Joint Commission, it might be possible for the two institutions to "cooperate side by side in different fields." However, the French delegation still believes that when the opinions of the two parties differ, the recommendations of the Neutral Nations Commission should be considered "compulsory." The French delegation also said that it is "unnecessary" to allow neutral countries to have police forces to enforce their recommendations, and if any party disagrees with the recommendations of the Neutral Nations Commission, it can submit it to the countries participating in the guarantee for handling.

It is reported that the Chinese delegation also spoke at the meeting. The Chinese delegation expressed its support for the Soviet delegation's opinion regarding holding a more restricted meeting by the current heads of delegations. The Chinese delegation pointed out that before the issue of ceasefire supervision is fully resolved, the conference still faces some differences that must be overcome. The conference should affirm the common ground as a basis for further negotiations, and further negotiate those opinions that have not reached complete consensus in a spirit of reconciliation, in order to seek a reasonable solution. The Chinese delegation believes that in the various issues of ceasefire supervision and international guarantees, there is definitely common ground in the opinions of all parties.

First of all, the Chinese delegation pointed out that on the issue of the composition of various ceasefire supervision agencies, everyone agrees that there should be two types of agencies, and they all agree that the Joint Commission should be composed of representatives of both command headquarters, and the International Commission should be composed of representatives of neutral countries. On the issue of the members of the Neutral Nations Commission, some delegations proposed that it should be served by the countries of the Colombo Conference. Among the four countries proposed by the Soviet delegation on May 31, there were two countries of the Colombo Conference. In the further suggestions of the Soviet delegation on June 16, the five or three countries proposed each included three or two Colombo Conference countries, and these suggestions are completely reasonable.

On the issue of the powers of the ceasefire supervision agencies, the Chinese delegation believes that the opinions of all parties also have common ground. The Chinese delegation pointed out that the French delegation stated that the relationship between the two agencies does not need to be expressed in terms of "subordination," and the powers of the two committees should be divided, and the conference should further discuss this issue. This claim is helpful. The Chinese delegation believes that the division of the scope of powers should be used to overcome the differences on the issue of the relationship between the two committees. The Soviet delegation put forward detailed suggestions on the issue of powers on June 14, and the Chinese delegation believes that the opinions of the French delegation should be adopted according to the Soviet suggestions, and the issue of powers should be entered into detailed discussions, and the differences are definitely not insurmountable.

Regarding the issue of voting by the Neutral Nations Commission, the Chinese delegation pointed out that in the suggestions of June 14, the Soviet delegation has appropriately divided and coordinated the principle of unanimous voting and the method of majority voting. On the issue of international guarantees, everyone agrees that the countries participating in this conference should guarantee it. The Chinese delegation believes that it should not be difficult to reach an agreement on all these issues based on negotiations based on the Soviet suggestions. The Chinese delegation finally suggested that an agreement be reached based on the Soviet delegation's suggestion on June 14, in order to promote an early full agreement on the issue of ceasefire supervision.

### 日内瓦会议二十五日举行限制性会议  苏联代表团建议举行限制性更大的会议

    日内瓦会议二十五日举行限制性会议
    苏联代表团建议举行限制性更大的会议
    【新华社日内瓦二十五日电】日内瓦会议讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的限制性会议二十五日发表公报如下：
    “九国代表团在六月二十五日的限制性会议中，继续讨论恢复印度支那和平问题。下次限制性会议将在六月二十九日举行。”
    【新华社日内瓦二十六日电】本社特派记者报道：九国代表团在二十五日举行的限制性会议上继续讨论停战监察问题。据悉，为了推进会议工作的进展，苏联代表团在这次会议上提出了建设性的意见。苏联代表团提议，由当前的各代表团团长偕同少数专家和译员举行限制性更大的会议，来讨论会议上的各项建议。苏联代表团的这一意见得到了中国代表团的支持。
    据悉，苏联代表团在会议上指出，苏联代表团是考虑到法国代表团和其他代表团的建议才提出这一意见的。法国代表团在上次限制性会议上曾建议，成立专家委员会来考虑“某些问题”。苏联代表团认为，这一建议原则上是合理的，苏联代表团愿审议专家委员会的组织形式和工作程序。然而，苏联代表团认为，应首先决定给予这一专家委员会以何种任务。如果把所有的工作都交给专家委员会去处理，那就会被人认为是对于会议工作的一种拖延。
    为了有助于更好地安排会议的工作，苏联代表团建议，由当前的各代表团团长偕同少数专家和译员举行限制性更大的会议，以详细讨论会议的各项建议。由于苏联代表团在六月十四日提出的十二点建议是当前各项建议中最详尽的一个，会议应以此建议作为讨论的基础，同时也可讨论其他代表团的建议。会议应决定哪些问题可以达成协议，哪些问题可在原则上达成协议，细节委派专家们加以研究，然后把结果报告各代表团团长。苏联代表团指出，这样做就会促进会议的进展，并早日拟出建议供将来外长们回来时考虑。
    苏联代表团在会议上还谈到了联合委员会和中立国监察委员会之间的关系问题。苏联代表团指出，会议早已决定应促成双方之间的直接接触，那种主张双方组成的联合委员会应隶属于中立国监察委员会的意见正是违背了这一原则，而苏联代表团主张两个组织应该是平行并分工的这一意见，是从这一原则出发的。停战既然主要靠双方的诚意，就不应对他们表示不信任。
    据悉，法国代表团在会议上表示与其使中立国监察委员会“凌驾于”联合委员会之上，让这两个机构“在不同的领域中并肩合作也许是可能的”。但是，法国代表团仍然认为在双方意见分歧时应认为中立国委员会的建议是带有“强迫性”的。法国代表团又说，让中立国拥有警察力量来强制实行其建议，“这是不必要的”，如果任何一方不同意中立国委员会的建议，即可提交参与保证的各国处理。
    据悉，中国代表团也在会议上发了言。中国代表团表示支持苏联代表团关于由当前的各代表团团长举行限制性更大的会议的意见。中国代表团指出，在停战监察问题全部解决之前，会议还面临着一些必须克服的分歧。会议应把共同点肯定下来作为进
  一步商谈的基础，而对那些没有取得完全一致的意见，本着和解精神进一步协商，以求得合理解决。中国代表团认为，在停战监察和国际保证的各项问题上，各方意见中的共同之点是肯定存在的。
    首先，中国代表团指出，在停战监察各种机构的组成问题上，大家都同意有两种机构，并都同意联合委员会由双方司令部代表组成，国际委员会由中立国代表组成。在中立国委员会的成员问题上，有些代表团提出应由科伦坡会议国家担任，苏联代表团在五月三十一日提议的四个国家中就包括了两个科伦坡会议国家，在六月十六日苏联代表团的进
  一步建议中所提出的五国或三国中，更各包括了三个或二个科伦坡会议国家，这些建议是完全合理的。
    在停战监察机构的职权问题上，中国代表团认为各方的意见也是有共同之点的。中国代表团指出，法国代表团表示两个机构的关系没有必要以“隶属”的字样来表达，两个委员会的职权应有所划分，会议应进一步讨论这个问题。这一主张是有帮助的。中国代表团认为，应该拿职权范围的划分来克服关于两个委员会之间的关系问题上的分歧。苏联代表团在六月十四日就职权问题提出了详尽建议，中国代表团认为应根据苏联建议采纳法国代表团意见，对职权问题进入细节讨论，分歧决不是不可克服的。
    关于中立国委员会的表决问题，中国代表团指出，苏联代表团在六月十四日的建议中，已把一致表决的原则和多数表决的方法加以适当的划分和配合。在国际保证问题上，大家都同意由本会议参与各国加以保证。中国代表团认为，在所有这些问题上根据苏联建议进行协商而达成协议，应该是并不困难的。中国代表团最后建议，以苏联代表团六月十四日的建议为基础达成协议，以便促成对停战监察问题早日达成全部协议。
