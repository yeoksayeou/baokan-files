Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 4th: The British "Manchester Guardian" published two articles on June 2nd and 3rd by former British Labour Cabinet Trade Minister Wilson, describing the impressions of himself and Conservative Member of Parliament Robson-Brown after meeting with our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade Lei Renmin in Geneva a few days ago. In these two articles, Wilson spoke about Sino-British trade, Sino-British relations, and general international political issues.

In his first article, Wilson said: "We clearly saw that the Chinese provided opportunities for greatly developing trade between China and Britain. We were interested in the wide range of goods they wanted to exchange." Wilson, in summarizing the discussion on trade issues, pointed out that China "is genuinely interested in trade for economic reasons, not for propaganda purposes." Wilson was very interested in the vast prospects that China's huge national construction plans offered for Sino-British trade.

In his second article, Wilson described in detail the friendly and sincere impression that Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai gave them.

When describing the conversation with Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai about Sino-British relations, he wrote:

"He (referring to Foreign Minister Zhou) expressed a strong, and we believe, sincere desire to improve trade.

"As Zhou Enlai walked to the door of his villa and waved goodbye to us, we both felt an indescribable feeling. His character, especially his clear desire to promote understanding between the two countries, made a deep impression on us. It is very obvious that Geneva provides an opportunity for governments to hold detailed discussions on necessary steps. But the significance of Geneva goes beyond this. In Geneva, China is engaging with the West for the first time, and as a major power, on an equal footing with other major powers. This shows that if the Chinese government achieves its legitimate status in the United Nations, much greater progress will be made in clearing obstacles and dispelling misunderstandings."

    英前贸易大臣威尔逊发表文章
    叙述会见周外长的印象
    【新华社日内瓦四日电】英国“曼彻斯特卫报”二日和三日接连刊载了英国前工党内阁贸易大臣威尔逊的两篇文章，叙述他和英国保守党国会议员罗布逊—布朗数日前在日内瓦会见我周恩来外长和对外贸易部副部长雷任民的印象。威尔逊在这两篇文章中分别谈到了中英贸易、中英关系和一般的国际政治问题。
    威尔逊在第一篇文章中说：“我们清楚地看到，中国人提供了大大发展中英两国贸易的机会。我们对他们希望交换的商品的广阔范围感到兴趣。”威尔逊在归纳关于贸易问题的谈话时指出，中国“对贸易真正感到兴趣，是由于经济原因，而不是由于宣传目的”。威尔逊对新中国的巨大的国家建设计划为中英贸易提供的广阔的远景，感到很大的兴趣。
    在他的第二篇文章中，威尔逊详细地叙述了周恩来外长所给予他们的友好和诚恳的印象。
    他在叙述到和周恩来外长谈到英中关系时写道：
    “他（指周外长）表示了一种强烈的，而且我们相信，是诚恳的改善贸易的愿望。
    “当周恩来走到他的别墅门口向我们挥手送别时，我们两个人都觉得我们有一种不可名状的感觉。他的品格、特别是他对促进两国谅解的清楚的愿望，给了我们很深的印象。十分明显，日内瓦提供了各国政府间就必要的步骤举行详细讨论的机会。但是，日内瓦的意义还不止于此。在日内瓦，中国是第一次与西方接触，而且是作为一个大国在与其他大国平等的基础上进行接触。这说明，如果中国政府取得了在联合国中的合法地位的话，在清除障碍和消除误解方面会取得大得多的成就。”
