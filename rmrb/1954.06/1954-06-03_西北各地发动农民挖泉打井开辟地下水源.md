Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, June 2nd: In the arid regions of Northwest China, where rainfall is scarce, the People's Government is mobilizing farmers to exploit underground water sources in order to increase farmland irrigation and water for human and animal consumption. This year, Tongxin County in Ningxia Province, Haiyuan County in Gansu Province, and Gonghe County in Qinghai Province will assist farmers in drilling three deep wells. The depth of these three deep wells will reach 200 to 400 meters. This will allow for the use of deep underground water sources to solve the problem of water shortage for humans and animals, and to conduct experiments on high-altitude irrigation. The state-owned Northwest Drilling Company has completed the drilling of a 300-meter deep well in Beiyuan, Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, and has installed a water pump. The water output is good. The materials for a deep well to be drilled in Tongxin County, Ningxia Province, are being transported and drilling will begin soon.

Shaanxi, Gansu and other places have insufficient water sources from existing earthen wells, and this year will vigorously develop pipe wells. These pipe wells utilize the original earthen wells, drilling and laying pipes at the bottom of the well, so that the second or third layer of underground water flows to the first layer of water source (the original earthen well uses the first layer of water source), in order to solve the difficulty of insufficient water source in the earthen well, so that the waterwheel can draw water day and night. Over the years, more than 500 pipe wells have been drilled in various parts of Shaanxi Province, and the water source is very abundant. This year, many pipe wells will be drilled in the suburbs of Xi'an, Lintong in Shaanxi Province, and Minqin and Shandan in Gansu Province.

In addition, in areas where the groundwater is shallower, work is also underway to dig springs and wells. Zhangye County in Gansu Province plans to dredge 13,029 old springs this year to increase water output, and dig 925 new springs. Farmers in Turpan County, Xinjiang Province, began excavating karez wells in January this year, and have excavated 309 karez wells in the past five months.

### 西北各地发动农民挖泉打井开辟地下水源

    西北各地发动农民挖泉打井开辟地下水源
   【新华社西安二日电】我国西北雨量稀少、气候干旱的地区，人民政府正发动农民开挖地下水源，以增加农田灌溉和人畜的用水。今年宁夏省同心县、甘肃省海原县和青海省共和县等地要帮助农民开凿三口深井。这三口深井的深度达二百公尺到四百公尺。这样可以把地下深层水源用来解决人畜用水困难和进行高塬灌溉的试验工作。国营西北钻探凿井社在陕西省咸阳县北塬上所开凿的一口三百公尺的深井已经完工，并已安装好抽水机，出水情况良好。宁夏省同心县要开凿的一口深井正在调运器材，不久也可开钻。
    陕西、甘肃等地原有土井水源不足，今年将大力开凿管井。这种管井是利用原来的土井，在井底上开钻下管，使地下第二层或第三层水源涌向第一层水源（原来的土井是利用第一层水源），以解决土井水源不足的困难，使水车可以日夜汲水。历年来，陕西省各地已凿管井五百多眼，水源很旺。今年西安市郊区、陕西省临潼和甘肃省民勤、山丹等地将开凿许多管井。
    另外，在地下水较浅的地区，也展开挖泉掏井工作。甘肃省张掖县今年计划要掏旧泉一万三千零二十九眼，以增加出水量，并挖新泉九百二十五眼。新疆省吐鲁番县农民从今年一月就开始掏挖坎儿井，五个月来已掏挖坎儿井达三百零九道。
