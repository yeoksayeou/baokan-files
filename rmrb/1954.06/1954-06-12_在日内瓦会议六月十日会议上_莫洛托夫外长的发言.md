Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 11th:

Mr. Chairman, esteemed delegates:

The Geneva Conference was convened to ensure the restoration of peace in Indochina. All participants have declared that it is necessary to quickly cease hostilities, stop the bloodshed in Indochina, and restore peace. However, declaring the cessation of hostilities and actually promoting the realization of the cessation of hostilities are two different things.

The Soviet delegation believes that this conference should consider both the military and political conditions necessary for the restoration of peace in Indochina. These conditions must be considered because it can prevent the cessation of hostilities from becoming a short-lived respite, and prevent subsequent hostilities from being launched on a larger scale or even more intensely. We believe that France has no less a stake in this issue than the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and other countries in Indochina.

At the same time, one cannot fail to see the contradiction between the verbal statements of wishing to end hostilities as soon as possible and the actual obstacles being created to reaching an agreement. It took nearly a month to finally realize here in Geneva the proposal repeatedly made by some delegations, including the Soviet delegation, to establish direct contact between the belligerent parties.

However, after this, it took some time for the French delegation to agree to establish direct contact between representatives of the two sides' command headquarters in Indochina. If such a simple issue as establishing direct relations between the two sides' command headquarters is delayed for several weeks, how can an early cessation of hostilities be achieved?

We are now discussing the establishment of a joint commission with representatives from the local command headquarters of both sides and the establishment of an international body to monitor the armistice agreement. However, on this road, some people are creating various artificial obstacles to hinder the reaching of an agreement. For example, last year's Korean Armistice Agreement quickly reached an agreement on the issue of neutral nations participating in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to monitor the implementation of the armistice terms, with representatives from Poland and Czechoslovakia. However, at the Geneva Conference, the same issue has been artificially turned into a topic of endless discussion. We have a very clear impression that some participants are only paying lip service to the necessity of ceasing hostilities, while in fact, they are creating various excuses to prove that reaching an agreement is impossible and using this time to conduct negotiations in Washington and elsewhere on the issue of other countries intervening in the Indochina war. Some people are using the discussion of the cessation of hostilities as an excuse to put forward various conditions and take various steps that have nothing to do with the desire to end hostilities in Indochina as soon as possible. It is very clear who should be held responsible for this.

The most important political issue being discussed here is the independence and national freedom of the people of Indochina. Some delegations want to push this issue aside. But this is certainly wrong.

The attitudes expressed here by the official representatives of the State of Vietnam, the Kingdom of Laos (formerly the Kingdom of Luang Prabang), and the Kingdom of Cambodia (formerly the Kingdom of Khmer)—with whom the French delegation seems to agree—have attracted attention. We have heard assurances from that side that there is no question about the independence of several countries in Indochina.

The representative of the Bảo Đại government of Vietnam announced here the text of the document that the government intended to sign with the French government. But, first of all, this document has not yet been signed, which means that such a treaty does not yet exist. Second, the issue is not about signing this or that document, but about guaranteeing the true independence and national freedom of the Vietnamese people. The representatives of the Kingdom of Laos and the Kingdom of Cambodia have tried to assure us that, as far as they are concerned, the issue of independence has already been resolved by the treaties concluded with France in 1949 or 1953. But, despite such documents, is it not strange that the struggle of the Lao and Khmer people for independence and national freedom has not stopped, but continues to develop?

We cannot but compare the following facts. The official representatives of the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Kingdom of Laos, and the State of Vietnam tirelessly proclaim that they have gained independence for their countries. But, if this is the case, then why has hardly any Asian country recognized it? Why do Asian countries not far from Indochina, such as India, Burma, Pakistan, and Indonesia, refuse to recognize that there is independence and national freedom in the State of Vietnam, the Kingdom of Cambodia, and the Kingdom of Laos? The speech today by the representative of the King of Cambodia, who is eager to separate one of the Indochinese states from the other two, did not clarify the issue under discussion at all.

The position of the United States government on this issue cannot be ignored. American officials have publicly declared almost every month last year and this year that France must finally guarantee the independence of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. It would not be difficult to list dozens of such remarks. The result is that the ruling circles in the United States care more about the independence of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos than the official representatives of the three kingdoms of Indochina themselves. However, a reservation must be made. When American officials talk about the need for Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos to have national freedom and independence, they often openly state that they do not care about the genuine independence of the three Indochinese states. The famous American Senator Nolan has publicly stated that Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos can be granted independence within five years, but France should make some appropriate announcement on this issue now to facilitate the recruitment of Vietnamese people into the army, which the American aggressive bloc wants to use to continue the war in Indochina. Many of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's remarks are consistent with this view.

From this, it is not difficult to understand why American officials often talk about the need to give independence to Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos at home, and why the American delegation has consistently avoided talking about this issue at this meeting. It would not be considered a new thing if I pointed out the fact that the American delegation at the Geneva Conference has so far made no mention of the fact that the people of Indochina still do not have national independence, nor has it mentioned who should be held responsible for this situation.

It is known that the Geneva Conference believed that the military representatives of the belligerent parties must begin to resolve the issue of the areas of concentration of troops on both sides after the ceasefire. On this point, all participants in the conference agreed with the opinion of the Soviet delegation that the Geneva Conference should proceed from the principle of Vietnamese unification, which is a matter that need not be discussed.

Here, we have heard the opinions of the representatives of the Bảo Đại government on the issue of Vietnamese unification more than once. But this government now only controls a small piece of land in Vietnam. In order to effectively defend the unification of Vietnam, it is necessary to guarantee the unity of the Vietnamese people. The best basis for this guarantee is to hold universal elections throughout Vietnam as soon as possible. But the official representatives of the State of Vietnam avoid talking about this point. Only the Democratic Republic of Vietnam insists on this. This seems to prove that, regardless of the opinions of the people themselves, the official representatives of the Bảo Đại government are satisfied with their activities and their relations with France. But objective facts require a critical attitude towards this position. In 1945, Bảo Đại said in his abdication declaration: "Although I have been on the throne for twenty years... I have not done anything to benefit the people as I wished, and therefore I am worried and regretful..."

It is also meaningful to mention this declaration in the current situation. The former abdicated Bảo Đại is now back in power. But what evidence is there that the situation in Vietnam has improved at present? There is no such evidence.

The American representative launched an attack on the Soviet Union here yesterday, repeating the same old clichés and slanders; this is what they always do when they have nothing to say about the substance of the matter. This time, he brought up some past events and distorted them. For example, he also talked about the incorrectness of the Soviet policy towards Poland when the Soviet Union and Germany signed the non-aggression pact in 1939.

This statement is obviously untenable. Regarding this, it is enough to take a look at the famous historical material published by the Soviet Union in 1948 entitled "Falsifiers of History." Everyone can see that the policy consistently pursued by the Soviet Union towards Poland has established friendly and truly good relations between the Soviet and Polish countries. On the other hand, the American representative is obviously not qualified to play the role of defender of Poland. To illustrate this, it is enough to point out one fact: how stubbornly the American representative here opposes Poland's participation in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to supervise the ceasefire in Indochina. This once again shows that for American representatives, words and deeds do not need to be consistent forever.

However, it is beneficial for us to understand from the American representative some things about the American policy on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina that we are currently discussing. This policy is currently one of the main obstacles hindering the cessation of hostilities in Indochina and hindering the establishment of a lasting peace in Indochina that the people of Vietnam, Khmer, and Laos desire.

To this end, all of us, including the American representative, should not create artificial obstacles to hinder reaching an agreement on the terms of the speedy cessation of hostilities in Indochina.

To this end, all participants in the Geneva Conference must also recognize that, while solving military issues, the interests of establishing a solid and reliable peace in Indochina require solving appropriate political issues. These issues primarily include the issue of ensuring the independence of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, and the issue of restoring unification in each of the three countries of Indochina under conditions of freedom and holding universal elections.

The task of the Geneva Conference will be accomplished if the Geneva Conference can prevent the expansion of the war in Indochina and prevent attempts to establish new military aggressive blocs for this purpose. This task will be accomplished if the Geneva Conference is committed to the early cessation of hostilities and reaching an agreement on the basic conditions for restoring peace in Indochina.

If Mr. Eden's speech today can contribute to achieving this goal, it will be in line with the main purpose of the conference.

### 在日内瓦会议六月十日会议上  莫洛托夫外长的发言

专栏：

    在日内瓦会议六月十日会议上
    莫洛托夫外长的发言主席先生、各位代表：
    日内瓦会议的召开，是为了保证恢复印度支那的和平。所有与会者都宣称必须迅速停止敌对行动，停止在印度支那的流血，恢复和平。但是宣称停止敌对行动和在实际上促进停止敌对行动的实现是两件不同的事。
    苏联代表团认为，本会议应该考虑对恢复印度支那和平都是必需的军事条件和政治条件。所以必须考虑这些条件是因为可以使得敌对行动的停止不致成为短暂的喘息机会，并不致随后敌对行动在更大规模甚至更为激烈的程度上被发动起来。我们认为法国和这个问题的利害关系，绝不小于越南民主共和国及印度支那其他国家和这个问题的利害关系。
    同时，人们不能不看到，在希望尽早停止敌对行动的口头声明和正在制造中的、达成协议的实际障碍之间存在着矛盾。差不多费了一个月的时间，才终于使得某些代表团、包括苏联代表团在内所一再提出的关于由交战双方建立直接接触的建议在日内瓦这里实现。
    然而在这以后，又费了一些时间才使法国代表团同意双方司令部代表在印度支那当地建立直接接触。如果像双方司令部建立直接关系这样一个简单的问题都拖延了好几个星期，那么如何能实现早日停止敌对行动呢？
    现在我们正在讨论建立由当地的双方司令部代表参加的联合委员会和建立国际机构来监察停战协定的问题。但是在这条道路上，也有人在制造种种人为的障碍来阻挠协议的达成。例如，去年的朝鲜停战协定，在波兰和捷克斯洛伐克代表参加对停战条款的履行进行监察的中立国委员会的问题上很快就达成了协议。但是在日内瓦会议上，同样的这个问题，却被人为地变成了一个讨论不休的题目。我们有一个十分明确的印象就是：某些与会者只一味侈谈停止敌对行动的必要，而实际上，却在制造种种借口来证明达成协议是不可能的，并利用这段时间来在华盛顿和其他某些地方进行关于别的国家干涉印度支那战争问题的谈判。有人正以讨论停止敌对行动为借口，提出各种条件，并采取各种与早日停止印度支那敌对行动的意愿毫不相干的步骤。谁应该对此负责，事情本身就很清楚。
    在这里讨论的最重要的政治问题，是印度支那人民的独立和民族自由问题。有些代表团想把这个问题撇到旁边。但这当然是错误的。
    越南国、老挝王国（前称寮国王国）和柬埔寨王国（前称高棉王国）的正式代表在这里表示的态度——法国代表团似乎和他们是一致的——引起了注意。我们从那方面听到保证说，印度支那几个国家的独立毫无问题。
    保大越南政府代表在这里宣布了这个政府和法国政府打算签订的文件的本文。但是，首先，这个文件还没有签订，这就意味着这样一个条约还不存在。第二，问题不在于签订这个或是那个文件，而是在于保证越南人民的真正独立和民族自由。老挝王国和柬埔寨王国的代表竭力向我们保证说，就他们而论，独立问题已经由一九四九年或一九五三年和法国缔结的条约解决了。但是，虽然有这样的文件，寮国和高棉人民争取独立和民族自由的斗争却并没有停止，而且还继续发展，这难道不是很奇怪的事情吗？
    我们不能不把下面的事实比较一下。柬埔寨王国、老挝王国和越南国的正式代表孜孜不倦地宣告说，他们为他们的国家获得了独立。但是，如果事情是这样的话，那么为什么几乎没有一个亚洲国家承认它呢？为什么像印度、缅甸、巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚等这些离印度支那不远的亚洲国家，拒绝承认在越南国、柬埔寨王国和老挝王国有独立和民族自由呢？渴望把印度支那的一国和其他两国分开的、柬埔寨国王的代表今天的发言，一点没有把在讨论中的问题阐明。
    不能忽略美国政府在这个问题上的立场。美国的官方人士去年和今年几乎每个月都在公开宣称，法国最后必须保证越南、柬埔寨和老挝的独立。这样的谈话要列举几十个是不难的。结果是：美国的统治集团关心越南、柬埔寨和老挝的独立甚于印度支那三个王国的正式代表自己。然而，必须作个保留。当美国的官方人士谈到必须让越南、柬埔寨和老挝有民族自由和独立的时候，他们往往公开表示，他们并不关心印度支那三国的真正的独立。美国有名的参议员诺兰就曾公开说过，可以在五年之内让越南、柬埔寨和老挝独立，但是应该要法国现在就对这个问题作某种适当的宣告，以利于征召越南人入伍，参加美国的侵略集团想用来继续印度支那战争的军队。美国国务卿杜勒斯先生的许多谈话和这个观点是符合的。
    由此，就不难了解：为什么美国官方人士在国内常常谈到必须给越南、柬埔寨和老挝独立，为什么美国代表团在这个会上却一直对这个问题坚持避而不谈。如果我指出这一事实，即美国代表团在日内瓦会议上直到现在丝毫没有提到印度支那人民至今还没有民族独立，也没有提到谁应对这种局势负责，大家都不致认为是一件新鲜事情。
    大家知道，日内瓦会议曾认为交战双方军事代表必须着手解决停火后双方军队集结地区的问题。在这点上，会议的所有参加者都同意苏联代表团的意见，即日内瓦会议应根据越南统一的原则出发，这是用不着讨论的问题。
    这里我们不止一次地听到保大政府代表关于越南统一问题的意见。但是这个政府现在所管辖的只有越南不大的一块土地。为了要在实际上保卫越南的统一，必须保证越南人民的统一。这种保证最好的基础就是全越南尽早地进行普选。而越南国的官方机构的代表对这点却避而不谈。只有越南民主共和国坚持这一点。这似乎证明了：不管人民自己的意见如何，保大政府的官方代表却满意于自己的活动和他们与法国的关系了。但客观的事实要求对这种立场采取批判的态度。一九四五年保大曾在退位宣告中说过：“朕虽在位二十年……尚未如朕意愿做出一些裨益国民之工作，因而忧愁悔恨……。”
    在目前情况下提一提这个宣告也是有意义的。以前退位的保大现在又重新执政了。然而有什么东西能证明，目前越南的情况已有所改善了呢？这样的证明是没有的。
    美国代表昨天在这里对苏联进行了攻击、重复了老一套的千篇一律的诬蔑滥调；当他们对事情的实质无话可说时总是这样做的。这次他提起了过去的一些事情，并加以歪曲。例如，他还谈到一九三九年苏联与德国签订互不侵犯条约时对波兰的政策的不正确。
    这种说法显然是站不住脚的。关于这点只要看一看一九四八年苏联出版的名为“揭破历史捏造者”的这部有名的历史材料就够了。大家都看到，苏联对波兰所一贯执行的政策使苏波两国之间建立起了友谊的、真正良好的关系。从另一方面来讲，美国代表显然是不配担任波兰的辩护角色的。要说明这点只须指出一个事实就够了：美国代表在这里是多么顽固地反对波兰参加监督印度支那停战的中立国监察委员会。这再次表明，对于美国代表们来说，言行是不需要永远相符的。
    但是，从美国代表那里了解一下美国对我们目前所讨论的关于恢复印度支那和平问题的政策中的某些东西，对我们是有好处的。这一政策在目前是那些阻碍停止印度支那敌对行动，阻碍在印度支那建立为越南、高棉和寮国人民所渴望的持久和平的那些主要障碍之一。
    为此，我们大家，包括美国代表在内，不应该制造人为的障碍来阻碍就尽速停止印度支那敌对行动的条款达成协议。
    为此所有参加日内瓦会议的人还必须承认，与解决军事问题同时，建立印度支那巩固的和可靠的和平的利益要求解决适当的政治问题。这些问题首先包括关于确保越南、寮国和高棉的独立问题以及印度支那三国中的每一国在自由和举行普选的条件下恢复统一的问题。
    如果日内瓦会议能阻止在印度支那扩大战争并为此而建立新的军事侵略集团的企图的话，日内瓦会议的任务将能得到完成。如果日内瓦会议致力于及早停止敌对行动和在恢复印度支那和平的基本条件上达成协议的话，这个任务将能得到完成。
    如果今天艾登先生的发言能够对达到这个目的有所贡献的话，那就会符合于会议的主要目的了。
