    Renmin University of China has achieved success in training revolutionary cadres and industrial workers to become national construction talents in recent years. This year, in order to further enhance the role of Renmin University of China in cultivating worker-peasant cadres, the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government has decided that, in addition to the Russian Language Department and the Diplomacy Department participating in the unified national enrollment to recruit some high school graduates, all other departments of the university's undergraduate program will exclusively recruit on-the-job cadres and industrial workers. The Ministry has also decided that the university will handle its own enrollment matters.
    In accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Higher Education, Renmin University of China has organized six enrollment work teams to handle application work in six major cities: Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Xi'an. The university's enrollment work will be divided into two stages. The first stage, from July 3rd to 13th, will be dedicated to handling undergraduate applications. Cadres who have participated in revolutionary work for more than five years and industrial workers with more than three years of work experience, possessing a cultural level equivalent to junior high school graduation or above, or cadres who have participated in revolutionary work for less than five years but possess a cultural level equivalent to high school graduation, are eligible to apply for undergraduate programs. The second stage, from July 15th to 25th, will handle applications for specialized courses and preparatory courses. The university's specialized courses are specifically for the rotational training of on-the-job cadres at the intermediate level (section chief level) or above. All students will be selected by the relevant business departments, and no separate enrollment will be conducted. The university's preparatory courses mainly recruit industrial workers with a cultural level equivalent to higher primary school graduation or above, while also recruiting qualified revolutionary cadres. In addition, the university will accept more than 500 graduate students. Special personnel from each enrollment team will handle the selection of graduate students.

    中国人民大学即将办理新生报考工作
    中国人民大学几年来在培养革命干部及产业工人成为国家建设人才方面已经取得成绩。今年中央人民政府高等教育部为了更进一步发挥中国人民大学培养工农干部的作用，决定该校除俄文系、外交系参加全国统一招生招收一部分高中毕业学生外，本科其他各系均完全招收在职干部及产业工人，并决定由该校自行办理招生事宜。
    中国人民大学遵照高等教育部的指示，组织了六个招生工作组，分别在北京、沈阳、上海、武汉、重庆、西安六大城市办理报考工作。该校招生工作将分为两个阶段进行。第一阶段自七月三日至十三日专门办理本科的报考工作。凡参加革命工作五年以上的干部及三年以上工龄的产业工人具有相当于初中毕业以上的文化水平或参加革命工作不足五年的干部具有相当于高中毕业的文化水平者，均可报考本科。第二阶段自七月十五日至二十五日办理专修科、预科的报考工作。该校专修科专门轮训中级（科长级）以上在职干部，全部学员均由各有关业务部门负责抽调，不另行招生。该校预科主要招收具有相当于高小毕业以上文化水平的产业工人，同时也招收合乎条件的革命干部。此外，该校并将接受研究生五百余人，选拔研究生的工作，各招生组亦有专人办理。
