The "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" has been translated into five minority languages: Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Korean by the Nationalities Publishing House. Except for the Tibetan version, which still needs rhetorical verification, the other four language versions of the draft constitution have been submitted to the Central Nationalities Printing Factory for printing. To enable the Uyghur and Kazakh people of Xinjiang Province to study and discuss it as soon as possible, the stereotype plates of the Uyghur and Kazakh versions, which were rushed out, were sent by air to Xinjiang for printing on the morning of the 15th. The Nationalities Publishing House plans to publish 25,000 copies of the Mongolian version of the draft constitution, 14,000 copies of the Tibetan version, and 77,000 copies of the Korean version. The Uyghur and Kazakh versions will be mainly published in Xinjiang, with a total of 2,500 copies printed in Beijing.

In March of this year, the Nationalities Publishing House began trial translations based on the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China (First Draft)." To ensure accurate translation, each translation and compilation office, in addition to consulting various relevant documents, minority dictionaries, books, and periodicals, also invited scholars and professors from various minority nationalities to help with translation and correction. Sang Re Jia Cuo, Deputy Director of the Department of Culture and Education of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, Dan Ba, a Tibetan professor at the Northwest Nationalities Institute, and Hou Shengzhen were invited to Beijing to assist in translation and proofreading. The Propaganda Department of the Inner Mongolia Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Inner Mongolia People's Publishing House, and the Inner Mongolia Mongolian Language Research Association all sent people to Beijing for assistance. Saifuddin, Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, recently also helped the publishing house proofread the Uyghur version.

The staff of the Nationalities Publishing House and the Central Nationalities Printing Factory demonstrated a serious and responsible spirit in the translation, typesetting, and printing work. The staff of the publishing house's translation and compilation offices frequently held meetings to study and discuss and solve difficult problems encountered in translation. To quickly translate, many translators worked overnight. Wang Yi, a female Tibetan typesetter at the printing factory, insisted on typesetting at night. She said that the Tibetan people are far from Beijing, and the sooner it is typeset and printed, the sooner they can see it. The workers responsible for typesetting the Uyghur and Kazakh versions completed the stereotype plates for airmail to Xinjiang at 2:00 am on the 15th. (Xinhua News Agency)

    宪法草案译成蒙、藏、维、哈和朝鲜等族文字
    “中华人民共和国宪法草案”已经民族出版社翻译成蒙、藏、维吾尔、哈萨克和朝鲜等五种少数民族文字。除藏文部分还需在修辞方面进行核正外，其他四种文字译成的宪法草案，都已交中央民族印刷厂付印。为使新疆省维吾尔、哈萨克族人民早日学习和讨论，在十五日晨，已将赶制的维吾尔文和哈萨克文的纸型，航寄新疆印行。民族出版社准备出版宪法草案蒙文版二万五千册，藏文版一万四千册，朝鲜文版七万七千册，维吾尔文和哈萨克文版主要在新疆出版，北京共印二千五百册。
    民族出版社今年三月间就根据“中华人民共和国宪法草案（初稿）”试行翻译。为使翻译精确，各个编译室除参考阅读各种有关文件、少数民族辞典、书刊外，还请各少数民族的学者、教授帮助翻译校正。青海省人民政府文教厅副厅长桑热嘉错、西北民族学院藏文教授丹巴、侯生祯等被邀请到北京协助译校；中共中央内蒙古分局宣传部、内蒙古人民出版社、内蒙古蒙文研究会都派人来京帮助；新疆省人民政府副主席赛福鼎最近也帮助出版社核正了维吾尔文版。
    民族出版社和中央民族印刷厂的职工在翻译、排印工作中，表现了严肃认真、积极负责的精神。出版社各编译室工作人员，经常开会研究讨论，解决翻译中遇到的疑难问题；为了迅速译出，有不少编译人员连夜工作。印刷厂藏文排字女工王毅，坚持在夜间排字，她说，藏族人民距离北京很远，早排印一天，他们就可以早看见一天。负责排制维吾尔、哈萨克文的工人，在十五日晨二时完成了航寄新疆的纸型。　（新华社）
