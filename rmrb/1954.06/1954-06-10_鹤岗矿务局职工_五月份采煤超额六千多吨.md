Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 5th: The Hegang Mining Bureau exceeded its May national production plan by more than six thousand tons in a balanced way. The labor competition launched by all employees in May, with technological innovation as its main content, was an important guarantee for exceeding the national plan. In May, 80% of the coal mining sites in the bureau promoted new coal mining methods such as "full-height extraction in one go" and "metal mesh false roofs," which greatly improved the recovery rate. At the same time, in order to fully prepare coal mining sites for the coal miners, the tunneling workers of the bureau promoted advanced experiences such as the "single double-section slotting method" in May, which improved tunneling efficiency. The employees of the coal preparation plant paid special attention to the improvement of mechanical efficiency and technical level in May, and completed the monthly plan five days ahead of schedule, while ensuring the quality of coal washing.

    五月份采煤超额六千多吨
    【新华社哈尔滨五日电】鹤岗矿务局超额六千多吨均衡地完成了五月份的国家生产计划。全体职工在五月份开展了以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛，是超额完成国家计划的重要保证。五月份，全局有百分之八十的采煤场子推行了“一次采全高”、“金属网假顶”等新采煤方法，大大提高了回采率。同时，为了给采煤工充分准备出采煤场子，全局掘进工五月份推行了“单一双段掏槽法”等先进经验，提高了掘进效率。选煤厂职工五月份特别注意了机械效能和技术水平的提高，在保证洗煤质量的条件下，提前五天完成了全月计划。
