Many factories in Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Huangshi are actively preparing for summer heat prevention and cooling.

    Since April, the five major cotton mills in Wuhan have overhauled their existing cooling equipment and added new cooling equipment. The state-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory alone invested 3.8 billion yuan this year in adding cooling equipment. The joint state-private Yuhua Cotton Mill installed rooftop sprinkler systems in major workshops, added twelve large exhaust fans in the cloth preparation workshop, and added two exhaust fans in the spinning workshop. The cotton mills are also preparing to strengthen the use of deep well water for cooling. The joint state-private Wuchang No. 1 Cotton Mill originally had twelve deep water wells and will add five more this year. These cotton mills are striving to ensure that the workshop temperature does not exceed the national standard of 96 degrees Fahrenheit this summer.

    Huangshi City's Daye Steel Plant formulated a heat prevention and cooling plan in March and has already begun to implement it. The plant's heat prevention expenditure this year is more than 3 billion yuan, more than double that of last year. They originally had 47 motor fans and purchased 40 more this year, all of which have been converted to spray type. In addition to the original ice-making plant, they added soda machines and popsicle machines, which can supply 10,000 bottles of soda and 20,000 popsicles daily. In addition, they also decided to increase the health food allowance for high-temperature workers from 60,000 yuan per person per month to 120,000 yuan from June to September to increase nutrition. The plant also compiled and printed heat prevention knowledge, which was distributed to all employees.

    The Guangzhou Textile Factory held a meeting at the end of March to discuss the issue of the highest temperature standards in the workshop and formulated a plan for heat prevention and cooling measures. The Guangdong Textile Factory plans to allocate 2.5 billion yuan to install low-temperature water air-supply fans, replace asbestos tiles on the roof, and increase the air ducts of the air-supply fans.

    The state-owned Wuchang Shipyard, the joint state-private Huaxin Cement Plant, and some local state-owned factories in Wuhan have also carried out a lot of cooling work.

    武汉广州等市许多工厂积极准备防暑降温
    武汉、广州和黄石市许多工厂积极进行夏季防暑降温的准备工作。
    武汉市五大纱厂从四月份起都检修了原有的降温设备，并增设新的降温设备，单是国营武汉第一棉纺织厂今年增添降温设备的投资就达三十八亿元。公私合营裕华纱厂在主要车间安设了屋顶喷水设备，还在布场准备车间添设了十二把大排风扇，在细纱车间增加了两台抽风机。各纱厂还准备加强利用深井水降温，公私合营武昌第一纱厂原有深水井十二个，今年再增添五个。这些纱厂都争取做到今年夏季车间温度不超过国家规定的华氏九十六度。
    黄石市大冶钢厂三月份就订出了防暑降温计划，并已着手进行。该厂今年防暑经费为三十多亿元，比去年增加一倍多。他们原有四十七台马达风扇，今年又购买四十台，并全部改为喷雾式的；另在原有制冰场的基础上增添了汽水机、冰棒机，每日可供应汽水一万瓶与冰棒两万枝。此外，他们还决定从六月份至九月份将高温工人的保健饭，由每月每人六万元增至十二万元，以增加营养。该厂还编印了防暑常识，分发给全体职工。
    广州市纺织厂在三月底开会讨论了车间最高温度标准问题，并订出了防暑降温措施计划。广东纺织厂预计拨出经费二十五亿元，以装置低温水送风机、屋顶换石棉瓦和加大送风机风管等设备。
    国营武昌造船厂、公私合营华新水泥厂与武汉市部分地方国营工厂，也都进行了许多降温工作。
