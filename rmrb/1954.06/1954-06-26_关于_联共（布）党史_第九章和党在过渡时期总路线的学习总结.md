The Political Department of the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government

    The entire cadre of the high, middle, and primary level study groups of the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government, under the leadership of the Party Committee of the Central People's Government and the Party Group of the Ministry, began studying Chapter Nine of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" on August 15, 1953. From November 15, 1953, to March 15 of this year, they studied the Party's General Line during the transition period. At the beginning of the study of Chapter Nine of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," the Party Committee first convened a meeting of all cadres to mobilize them, and the Party Committee formulated a study plan, issued study outlines, and focused on lectures and tutoring, calling on everyone to study diligently and opposing the attitude of not studying hard. In order to strengthen the Party's leadership, the Party Committee also corrected the tendency of some units not seriously implementing the plan, and emphasized that leading theoretical study is one of the central tasks of the Party branch, and the leading cadres of the Party members of each bureau, division, and company must personally participate in the leadership of the study work. Throughout the entire study process, nine joint meetings of branch responsible comrades were held successively to continuously study and solve the problems existing in the study. The responsible comrades of the Party Group of the Ministry took the lead, adhered to and led the study of the senior group, and in addition to mobilizing all cadres to study seriously, also made four more comprehensive and systematic special reports combining commercial work during the general line study process. Subsequently, in conjunction with the study of the importance of state-owned commerce during the transition period, the Ministry of Commerce summarized the work of 1953 and formulated the work policy for 1954. Finally, cadres above the section chief level wrote study心得 [xīndé - insights, reflections], and the middle and primary level groups generally conducted tests.
    Through the study of Chapter Nine of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and the General Line, all cadres clearly recognized the general policy and specific path of our country's gradual transition to a socialist society, clearly recognized the essence of the Party's General Line during the transition period, thereby improving their theoretical and policy level and class consciousness, criticizing bourgeois ideology, and playing a significant role in improving various tasks. The gains of this study are in the following three aspects:
    I. Further clarified the importance of state-owned commerce during the transition period.
    In order to closely integrate theoretical study with practical work, we conducted an inspection and summary of the work in 1953 when studying how state-owned commerce serves socialist industrialization during the transition period, and how to realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. In the study, some comrades made a more profound review of their past incorrect ideas of not comprehensively considering issues from the perspective of the Party's policies, but rather one-sidedly believing that completing the purchase and sales plan, ensuring the payment of profits, and accumulating funds for the state meant completing the task, and that commercial work was just about making money, and the more money made, the better the work.
    After studying, we further clarified that the basic task of state-owned commerce during the transition period is: to serve production and the growing needs of the people. From expanding mutual assistance between urban and rural areas and internal and external exchanges, stabilizing the market, continuously expanding commodity circulation, and promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production, thereby increasing state tax revenue and reasonable profits, accumulating funds for the state to ensure national industrial construction, gradually meeting the needs of the people and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and continuously and step by step strengthening state-owned commerce and cooperative economy, and utilizing, restricting, and socialist transforming capitalist industry and commerce.
    II. Further demarcated the ideological boundaries between the working class and the bourgeoisie.
    We criticized the following various bourgeois business ideas: not starting from industrial and agricultural production and the needs of the people, not starting from the Party's line and policies to determine and implement plans, but mistakenly compressing funds and using the amount of funds to determine the size of the purchase and sales plan and the boundaries of policies; not completing and increasing the payment of profits by expanding commodity circulation and adopting methods of accelerating capital turnover and reducing circulation costs according to the Party's policies, but using methods that violate the Party's policies to complete the payment of profits; and starting from the local perspective of the unit, not actively opening up sales channels to develop industry and assist the cooperative economy to strengthen the socialist economy, etc. For example, some comrades in the China Department Store had an unclear understanding of supporting cooperatives, and always wanted to sell hot-selling goods themselves and give slow-moving goods to cooperatives. The Shanghai station of the China Department Store adopted a negative attitude towards the products of the state-owned China Soap Factory, but on the contrary, it doubled the orders for the products of the private Wuzhou Soap Factory because of the fast turnover and high profits, resulting in the state-owned soap factory processing and producing for the private Wuzhou Soap Factory.
    After criticizing the above-mentioned bourgeois business ideas, the socialist consciousness of the cadres was improved. Therefore, in the work arrangement for 1954, there was a certain improvement in policy thinking. All companies clearly stated: "Unswervingly serving production and the growing needs of the people," "Actively purchasing and promoting state-owned industrial and local industrial products under the requirement of promoting improved quality and reduced costs," "Implementing the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, consolidating and steadily developing the wholesale front," "Correctly implementing price policies, actively expanding commodity circulation, further improving business management, and accumulating funds for the state." In order to realize this policy, in import and export business, it is emphasized to expand commodity circulation, vigorously support production, and gradually meet the supply; in organizing the source of goods, different treatments are given according to the different public and private economic components; in sales, it is clearly stated that under the principle of not affecting the planned development of production, actively expand sales, the supply objects should first meet the needs of state-owned, cooperative, and basic construction departments, and implement the support policy for cooperatives, earnestly implement preferential measures for cooperatives, and try to meet their retail needs. In addition, private retailers should implement a wide range of wholesale methods, gradually manage their plans and prices, and lead them to the path of state capitalism. Wholesalers should be gradually replaced steadily according to needs, and those who have been replaced should be properly arranged.
    III. Improved class consciousness and inspired work enthusiasm.
    Through the study of the General Line, the class consciousness of the general cadres has been improved to a certain extent. Some comrades who were troubled by ideological problems also expressed their willingness to play their part in the great national construction with the improvement of socialist consciousness. For example, some cadres used to think that doing commercial work had no future and was not as glorious as in the industrial sector, so they were not at ease in their work. Now the work attitude of these comrades has changed.
    Due to the improved consciousness and enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres, new atmospheres have emerged in the work. For example, the comrades in the Statistics Section of the Planning Bureau improved the planning reports after the study, added two indicators of state capitalist industry and commerce and local industry, providing data for studying the growth of the socialist economy and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and the support of state-owned commerce for local industry. The decoding comrades of the Confidential Office actively used their brains to improve the power generation work, saving more than 176 million yuan in telegraph fees for the country in December. The Coal Industry Building Materials Company reduced cross-transportation in March, saving more than 2 billion yuan in transportation costs. The Finance and Accounting Section of the Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company changed the time for allocating funds and handling remittances, saving 2.6 billion yuan in interest in the fourth quarter of 1953. The comrades of the nursery school, due to the recognition that children are the new generation to build the motherland, improved the sense of responsibility for childcare work, and the accidents of children getting sick and falling have been reduced.
    Through this study, we have the following experiences in doing a good job in future theoretical studies:
    I. It is necessary to implement the principle of combining theory with practice. To achieve this, on the one hand, it is necessary to carefully read the documents and understand the spiritual essence of the documents; on the other hand, it is also necessary to grasp the main problems existing in the work of the unit and the thinking of the general cadres. Only by concentrating efforts to solve these main problems according to the spirit of the documents can the combination of theory and practice achieve significant results. After the senior group made a more systematic and comprehensive special report on the work of state-owned commerce to all cadres, all cadres immediately concentrated their efforts to launch a heated discussion on the role of state-owned commerce during the transition period. At the same time, in the inspection and summary of the work in 1953, it was found that capitalist business thinking is the main problem existing in our current work and in the thinking of the general cadres. In this way, we proposed to concentrate the direction of linking with reality on recognizing and criticizing the manifestations of various capitalist business thinking, and required each comrade to draw a line between capitalist business thinking and socialist business thinking. Facts have proved that this is completely correct, avoiding the vague connection with reality that is not relevant, and truly solving the main problems in the thinking of each comrade, laying the ideological foundation for correctly understanding and implementing the Party's policies in the future.
    II. To do a good job in theoretical study, it is necessary to closely combine ideological leadership and organizational leadership. At the beginning of studying each document, it is necessary to first put forward clear study objectives and requirements, and formulate specific study plans. For example, when the senior group started studying, it was stipulated that after initially understanding the spiritual essence of the General Line, they could conduct special discussions in groups, and each group must write written materials that can be used to make a report to the middle group, including the characteristics of the Chinese situation, such as the number of steps to implement national industrialization and socialist transformation of non-socialist economic components, and their interrelationships, and the role of state-owned commerce in implementing national industrialization and socialist transformation of non-socialist economic components. After the discussion of general issues, we will combine the summary work to specifically discuss the importance of state-owned commerce during the transition period. Because the leadership can point out the key points and requirements of the study in advance, and can inspire everyone to conduct in-depth discussions, the senior group not only improved itself in learning, but also greatly enlightened the entire cadre and solved many problems, taking fewer detours. The leadership of the middle group was not so specific and clear at the beginning of the study, but various problems could be discovered and solved in time during the study process, so that the study could be gradually deepened. At the beginning of the study, we emphasized that the Party organizations of each unit must regard leading theoretical study as one of the central tasks, preventing the phenomenon of slack learning in some units. The specific steps we take in leading the middle group for each unit of study are: at the beginning of the study, first explain the importance of studying this document, inspire learning enthusiasm, and at the same time arrange the key points and requirements of the study to guide and help comrades to conduct the study correctly. While the comrades are reading and discussing the documents, the Party branch promptly understands the progress of the study and the general ideological situation, formulates discussion questions, points out the central issues to be solved, and assists the instructors in studying the answers to the discussion questions. In the large group discussion, try to make conclusions as much as possible, and submit the problems that cannot be solved to the higher-level Party committee for answers. In addition, comrades who lead political and theoretical studies must have a general understanding of the business work of the unit. In this way, we can guide everyone to grasp the principle of combining theory with practice.
    III. Leadership attaches importance, and the higher-level Party committee grasps it tightly, which is an important link in doing a good job in theoretical study. This study was due to the timely deployment and inspection of the study by the Party Committee of the Central People's Government, constantly organizing reports and exchanging experiences; and the Party Group of the Ministry took the lead in leading the study, giving several special reports to everyone; and the responsible comrades of each unit also made reports to all cadres in their own units based on their own learning experience and the situation of their units, especially when discussing the importance of state-owned commerce during the transition period, except for individual units, the responsible comrades made reports to all cadres based on their own learning experience and the situation of their units, which played a great role in promoting learning.
    Although this study has achieved certain results, there are still many shortcomings in the leadership of the study. For example, in the initial stage of leading the middle group to connect theory with practice, because the main problems were not grasped and the guiding ideology was not clear, the study showed a slack phenomenon; many difficult problems raised in the study were not actively and timely solved even if they could be solved, but relied on the higher-level to solve them. Little research has been done on various learning methods. For example, some units think that large group discussions are not very effective, while some units think they are very good. We have not summarized this, so that learning methods can be gradually improved.

    关于“联共（布）党史”第九章和党在过渡时期总路线的学习总结
    中央人民政府商业部政治部
    中央人民政府商业部高、中、初三级学习组的全体干部，在中央人民政府党委及部党组的领导下，于一九五三年八月十五日开始学习“联共（布）党史”第九章。由一九五三年十一月十五日至今年三月十五日，学习了党在过渡时期的总路线。“联共
  （布）党史”第九章学习开始时，首先由党委召开全体干部会议作了动员，并由党委制定学习计划、印发学习提纲、抓紧讲课和辅导工作，号召大家认真读书，反对不刻苦钻研的学习态度。为了加强党的领导，党委还纠正了某些单位不认真贯彻计划的偏向，并强调指出：领导理论学习是党支部的中心任务之一，各局、处、公司的党员领导干部必须亲身参加学习的领导工作。在整个学习过程中，先后召开了九次支部负责同志联席会议，不断地研究和解决了学习中存在的问题。部党组负责同志以身作则，坚持和领导高级组的学习，除动员全体干部认真学习外，在总路线学习过程中又分别做了四次较为全面地系统地结合商业工作的专题报告。接着，结合国营商业在过渡时期重要性的学习，商业部总结了一九五三年的工作，制定出一九五四年的工作方针。最后，科长以上干部写了学习心得，中、初级组普遍进行了测验。
    通过“联共（布）党史”第九章和总路线的学习，全体干部明确认识了我国逐步过渡到社会主义社会的总方针和具体道路，明确认识了党在过渡时期的总路线的实质，从而提高了理论政策水平和阶级觉悟，批判了资产阶级思想，对各项工作的改进起了显著作用。这次学习的收获有下列三方面：
    一、进一步明确认识了国营商业在过渡时期的重要性。
    为使理论学习与实际工作紧密结合，我们在学习国营商业在过渡时期如何为社会主义工业化服务，如何实现对农业、手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的问题时，对一九五三年的工作进行了检查与总结。有些同志在学习中对自己过去不从党的政策出发全面考虑问题，而是片面地认为只要完成购销计划，保证上缴利润，为国家积累资金就算完成任务，认为商业工作就是赚钱，赚钱越多工作越好等不正确思想，也做了较为深刻的检查。
    经过学习，我们进一步明确了过渡时期国营商业的基本任务是：为生产与日益增长的人民需要服务。从扩大城乡互助，内外交流中，稳定市场，不断地扩大商品流通，促进工农业生产的发展，从而增加国家税收和合理利润，为国家积累资金，以保证国家工业建设，逐步满足人民的需要和巩固工农联盟，并不断地、有步骤地壮大国营商业与合作社经济，对资本主义工商业进行利用、限制和社会主义改造。
    二、进一步划清了工人阶级和资产阶级的思想界限。
    我们批判了以下各种资产阶级经营思想：不从工农业生产与人民需要出发，不从党的路线和政策出发来决定计划并执行计划，而是错误地压缩资金，用资金多少决定购销计划的大小，决定政策的界限；不是根据党的政策，通过扩大商品流转，采取加速资金周转与降低流转费用的办法来完成和增加上缴利润，而是采用违反党的政策的办法来完成上缴利润；以及从本单位的局部观点出发，不去积极地为发展工业而开辟销路，扶助合作社经济，以壮大社会主义经济等等。如中国百货公司有的同志对扶助合作社的认识不明确，总愿把热货由自己出售，把冷货给合作社。中国百货公司上海站，对国营中国肥皂厂的产品，采取消极推托态度，相反地，对私营五洲肥皂厂的产品，由于周转快、利润高而加倍订货，造成国营肥皂厂给私营五洲肥皂厂加工生产的现象。
      在批判了上述资产阶级经营思想后，提高了干部的社会主义觉悟。因而在一九五四年的工作安排上，政策思想有了一定的提高。各公司都明确地提出：“坚定不移地为生产和人民日益增长的需要服务”，“在促进提高质量、降低成本的要求下，积极收购和推销国营工业与地方工业产品”，“贯彻对资本主义工商业的利用、限制、改造政策，巩固和稳步地发展批发阵地”，“正确执行物价政策，积极扩大商品流通，进一步改善经营管理，给国家积累资金”的经营方针。为实现这一方针，在进销业务上强调扩大商品流通，大力扶持生产，逐步满足供应；在组织货源上，根据公私经济成分的不同，分别给以不同的对待；在销货上，明确地提出在不影响生产有计划发展的原则下，积极扩大推销，供应对象首先满足国营、合作社及基本建设部门，并贯彻对合作社的扶持政策，切实执行对合作社优待办法，尽量满足其零售的需要。另外，对私营零售商要实行广泛批购办法，逐步管理其计划和价格，引向国家资本主义道路，对批发商要根据需要稳步地逐渐代替，并对已代替者进行妥善安排。
    三、提高了阶级觉悟，鼓舞了工作热情。
    通过总路线的学习，一般干部的阶级觉悟有一定提高。有些闹思想问题的同志也随着社会主义觉悟的提高，表示愿在伟大的祖国建设中发挥自己一砖一瓦的作用。如有些干部过去认为做商业工作没有前途，不如在工业部门光荣，因而不安心工作，现在这些同志的工作态度已有所改变。
    由于广大干部提高了觉悟和发挥了工作热情，工作中出现了新的气象。如计划局统计科的同志们在学习后，改进了计划表报，增加了国家资本主义工商业及地方工业的两个指标，给研究社会主义经济增长情况和对资本主义工商业改造及国营商业对地方工业扶持的情况提供了资料。机要处的译电同志，积极开动脑筋，改进了发电工作，在十二月份内为国家节省了报费一亿七千六百多万元。煤业建筑器材公司三月份减少了交叉运输，节省了运费二十余亿元。花纱布公司财会科改变了下拨资金办理汇款的时间，在一九五三年第四季度内节省利息二十六亿元。保育院的同志，由于认识孩子是建设祖国的新生一代，提高了保育工作的责任心，孩子生病、跌交的事故减少了。
    通过这次学习，我们对搞好今后的理论学习有如下几点体会：
    一、必须贯彻理论联系实际的原则。要做到这一点，一方面需要精读文件，把文件的精神实质弄清楚；另一方面还必须抓住本单位工作和一般干部思想中存在着的主要问题。只有依据文件的精神集中力量来解决这些主要问题，才能使理论联系实际收到显著的效果。我们在高级组向全体干部做了较有系统的、全面的关于国营商业工作的专题报告后，全体干部即集中力量就国营商业在过渡时期的作用问题展开了热烈的讨论。同时，在检查和总结一九五三年工作中，发现资本主义经营思想是当前我们工作中和一般干部思想中存在着的主要问题。这样，我们就提出把联系实际的方向集中到认识和批判各种资本主义经营思想的表现上面来，要求每个同志划清资本主义经营思想和社会主义经营思想的界限。事实证明，这样做是完全正确的，避免了不着边际的泛泛的联系实际，而真正解决了每个同志思想中的主要问题，给今后正确领会和执行党的政策打下了思想基础。
    二、要搞好理论学习，必须把思想领导和组织领导密切结合起来。开始学习每个文件时，首先应提出明确的学习目的和要求，制定出具体的学习计划。如高级组在开始学习时，规定在初步领会总路线的精神实质后，即可分组进行专题讨论，每个组必须写出能向中级组作传达报告的书面材料，内容应包括中国情况的特点，如实行国家工业化及对非社会主义经济成分进行社会主义改造大体上分几个步骤及其相互关系，国营商业在实行国家工业化及对非社会主义经济成分进行社会主义改造中起什么作用等问题。在一般问题讨论之后，再结合总结工作专门讨论国营商业在过渡时期的重要性。由于领导上能事先指出学习重点与要求，并能启发大家进行深入讨论，所以高级组学习不但本身有所提高，而且对于全体干部启示也很大，解决问题很多，走的弯路较少。对中级组的领导，在学习开始时，虽并不如此具体明确，但在学习过程中各种问题也能及时地发现和解决，因而使学习得以逐步深入。在学习开始时，我们强调各单位党的组织必须把领导理论学习当作中心任务之一，防止了某些单位学习松懈的现象。我们领导中级组每一单元学习的具体步骤是：在学习开始时，首先讲明学习这个文件的重要意义，启发学习热情，同时布置学习重点和要求，以指导和帮助同志们能正确地进行学习。在同志们阅读和讨论文件的同时，党支部及时了解学习进度及一般思想情况，拟定讨论题，指出要解决的中心问题，并协助辅导员研究讨论题的答案。在大组讨论中，能作结论的尽量作结论，不能解决的问题提交上级党委解答。此外，领导政治理论学习的同志，必须对本单位的业务工作，有概括的了解。这样才能引导大家掌握理论联系实际的原则。
    三、领导重视，上级党委抓紧，是搞好理论学习的一个重要环节。这次学习由于中央人民政府党委会对学习及时的布置、检查，不断地组织报告和交流经验；以及本部党组以身作则领导学习，给大家作了几次专题报告；各单位负责同志又在本单位进行问题解答和专题报告，特别是在讨论国营商业在过渡时期的重要性时，除个别单位外，负责同志都根据自己的学习体会结合本单位工作情况向全体干部作了报告，在推动学习上都起了很大的作用。
    这次学习虽然取得了一定的成绩，但在学习领导工作中依然有不少缺点。如在领导中级组理论联系实际开始阶段，因没有抓住主要问题，指导思想不明确，曾经使学习呈现松懈现象；学习中提出的很多疑难问题，有些能够解决的也没有主动地及时加以解决，而依赖上级来解决。对各种学习方法很少研究，如大组讨论，有的单位觉得作用不大，有的单位认为很好，我们也没有加以总结，使学习方法得以逐步改进。
