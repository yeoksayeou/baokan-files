    Why Farmers Don't Universally Use "666"
    Xia Yunfeng
    "666" has contact, stomach poison, and fumigation effects on insects. Insects will be poisoned if they touch, eat, or smell it. Its insecticidal effect is very significant. According to Soviet research, "666" can be absorbed by plant tissues, further increasing its insecticidal effect. For example, if "666" is sprayed on leaves, some root-biting insects will be poisoned; if "666" is poured into the soil, some insects on the leaves will also die. In addition, according to research by Soviet experts Shazonov and Bogdarin, "666" can also stimulate plant growth. They used "666" to eliminate cabbage pests and incidentally achieved a two-fold increase in production. In some areas of Shanxi and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in our country, there have also been facts of using "666" to poison grain or mix seeds to control underground insects and increase grain production. Guo Yuming of Chengguan District, Anyi County, Shanxi Province, used "666" to mix seeds for wheat on fourteen mu of land, with an average yield of 150 jin per mu, while the land without seed mixing only yielded 120 jin per mu.
      "666" is a byproduct of coking and alkali production industries, and our country can now produce it in large quantities. The agricultural departments have established raw powder processing plants in major regions across the country. The output in 1953 increased three times compared to 1951 and 1952, and the planned output in 1954 will increase by more than double compared to 1953.
    According to the experience of demonstration and promotion in various places over the past three years, "666" has proven to have good effects in controlling many kinds of pests. For example, to control locusts, using three jin of 0.5% "666" powder per mu can kill more than 95% of the locusts, while only one-sixth of the labor required for manual capture is needed. Using five jin of 0.5% "666" powder per mu to control wheat sucking bugs can generally reduce losses by more than 15%. "666" is effective in preventing and controlling major rice pests such as rice locusts, rice leaf rollers, rice stem borers, leaf beetles, ironclad beetles, rice stink bugs, wheat aphids, and spider mites. Underground insects, such as mole crickets, wireworms, and grubs, which are prevalent throughout the country, can be treated in one application with "666" poisoned grain. The 6% wettable "666" is also widely used. Most of the insects that can be controlled with powder can also be controlled with wettable powder, especially for controlling corn borers, cabbage aphids, ape leaf beetles, flea beetles, malignant leaf beetles, citrus aphids, pear fruit sawflies, pear stink bugs, persimmon headworms, and other pests. In addition, "666" powder is also very effective in controlling cotton pests such as cotton aphids, spider mites, plant bugs, and thrips. The cost of using "666" to control pests is very low. For example, using "666" poison bait to control locusts costs about 2,000 yuan per mu (200 yuan for pesticides and more than 1,000 yuan for wheat bran).
    Using this pesticide is much better than using pyrethrum, tobacco, and other plant-based insecticides. Not only is the price cheaper, but it also eliminates the need to occupy more cultivated land for planting pyrethrum and other plants, which affects the increase in grain and industrial raw material crops.
    Although the output of the pesticide "666" is very large and its uses are extensive, the current sales volume is very small, less than one-third of its output. Why does this phenomenon occur? The main reasons are: 1. The promotion work is not done well enough. Some agricultural technicians do not yet know the performance and usage of "666". 2. Some distribution units set higher selling prices. For example, the ex-factory price of 6% wettable "666" is 9,657 yuan per jin, but some grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives sell it for 13,000 to 20,000 yuan. The excessive processing costs of some processing plants also affect the selling price. 3. The variety of specifications of "666" is too great, making it difficult for the masses to master and hindering its widespread use.
    How to solve this problem?
    First, do a good job in technical promotion. Cadres at all levels of agricultural departments, especially those at the prefecture and county farms and technology extension stations, should learn the technology of using medicinal equipment to prevent and control pests, especially to be familiar with the performance, uses, effects, and specific methods of use of "666". Cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives that sell "666" should also understand the performance, uses, effects, and methods of use of this pesticide, so as to carry out promotion work in conjunction with sales. The methods of "guaranteeing teaching, guaranteeing understanding, and guaranteeing delivery" and "counter as a teaching platform" of supply and marketing cooperatives in Shandong and other places are worth learning from all over the country. In areas where there are no sprayers or powder sprayers, cadres of agricultural departments should also introduce the method of cloth bag powdering to farmers (see page 2 of the People's Daily on May 15).
    Second, reduce the price of "666". Although the pricing of "666" raw powder has been reduced a lot, and the profits of pesticide processing plants in Beijing, Zhengzhou, and other places have also been reduced from an average of 13.9% to 3% to 5%; however, the selling price of "666" supplied by some grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives is still quite high, and the packaging costs of processing plants are also high, so the price of this pesticide cannot be effectively reduced. These phenomena should be corrected immediately.
    Why is the selling price of "666" in some supply and marketing cooperatives high? The main reason is that the commodity circulation cost is high. Such supply and marketing cooperatives should, in accordance with the instructions issued by the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives on "reducing circulation costs in the management of medicines and equipment to reduce the burden on farmers," effectively reduce circulation costs. In carrying out this work, it is necessary to reduce management levels, implement reasonable transportation, and correct and prevent the phenomenon of roundabout transportation according to administrative divisions or administrative systems. In this way, the intermediate expenses will be reduced a lot. The grassroots cooperatives that are responsible for supplying pesticides should realize that doing a good job in supplying pesticides is specifically serving the development of industrial and agricultural production, and actively reduce the selling price of supplies by improving management and correcting management ideas.
    Why are processing costs high? The main reasons are high packaging costs and high loss rates. For example, the packaging cost of the Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory accounts for more than 59% of the ex-factory price; the loss rate and processing packaging costs of processing plants in Zhengzhou, Hunan, and other places are also very high. Therefore, to reduce processing costs, we should start with improving processing technology and improving packaging. Improving the processing fineness, selecting appropriate fillers, and improving the suspension and adhesion of wettable "666" can improve its effectiveness and relatively reduce the cost of using pesticides for farmers. Gradually trying to use oilcloth packaging methods or using domestically produced paper instead of imported paper for the six-layer kraft paper and one-layer cloth bag packaging method can also reduce some costs. Comrades in pesticide processing plants should study and improve the packaging under the principles of safe handling, less money, and convenient use.
    Third, the specifications of "666" should be appropriately simplified. "666" has seven or eight types, such as 0.5%, 0.65%, 1%, 1.4%, 1.5%, 2.5%, 6%, and 6.5%. At present, the cultural level of farmers in our country is generally low, so the more specifications of pesticides, the more difficult it is to promote them. For example, when controlling locusts last year, some farmers in Sihong, Anhui used 2.5% "666" powder as 0.5% "666", causing waste. According to the usage habits of the masses in most areas, 0.5%, 2.5%, 6% "666" powder and 6% wettable "666" are generally more popular; therefore, it is hoped that the processing department will produce more of the above specifications in the future. The 1.5% "666" used for aircraft locust control should also be guaranteed in accordance with the required quantity.

    农民为什么没有普遍使用“六六六”
    夏云峰
    “六六六”对于昆虫具有触杀、胃毒、熏蒸等作用，昆虫碰到、吃到或闻到它都会中毒，它的杀虫效力很大。根据苏联的研究，“六六六”能为植物组织所吸收，更增大了它的杀虫作用。如把“六六六”喷在叶子上，有些咬根的虫会中毒；如把“六六六”灌在土壤里，有些叶上的虫也会死亡。另据苏联专家沙宗诺夫和包哥达林研究，“六六六”还能刺激植物生长。他们曾用“六六六”消灭白菜害虫，并附带地收到增产两倍的效果。在我国山西和内蒙古自治区部分地区，也有过用“六六六”毒谷或拌种防治地下虫而多打粮食的事实。山西省安邑县城关区郭玉铭在十四亩地上用“六六六”拌种的小麦，每亩平均产一百五十斤，不拌种的土地，每亩只产一百二十斤。
      “六六六”是炼焦和制碱工业的副产品，我国目前已能大量生产；农业部门在全国各大区都设立了原粉加工厂。一九五三年的产量比一九五一、一九五二两年增加三倍，一九五四年的计划产量将比
  一九五三年再增产一倍多。
    根据三年来各地示范推广的经验证明“六六六”对除治很多种害虫都有良好的效果。如除治蝗虫，每亩用百分之零点五的“六六六”粉三斤，就可以杀死蝗虫百分之九十五以上，而只需用人工捕打所需人力的六分之一。用百分之零点五的“六六六”粉除治小麦吸浆虫，每亩用药五斤，一般可减少损失百分之十五以上。“六六六”对防治水稻主要害虫如稻蝗、稻包虫、稻螟、负泥虫、铁甲虫、稻椿象和小麦蚜虫、圆蜘蛛等都是有效的。在全国各地为害普遍的地下虫，如蝼蛄、金针虫、蛴螬等，用
  “六六六”毒谷可以一药三治。百分之六的可湿性
  “六六六”，用途也很广。凡粉剂能治的虫，可湿性的也大多能治；特别对除治玉米螟、菜蚜、猿叶虫、菜蚤、恶性叶虫、桔蚜、梨实蜂、梨椿象、柿大头虫等多种害虫都有效。此外，对于棉花虫害，如棉蚜、红蜘蛛、盲椿象、蓟马等，用“六六六”粉除治，效果也很好。用“六六六”防治害虫所需的成本很低。如用“六六六”毒饵除治蝗虫，每亩约需二千元左右（农药二百元，麦麸一千多元）。
    使用这种农药，比起使用除虫菊、烟草等植物性的杀虫剂要好得多，不但价格比较便宜，而且可以不必再为种植除虫菊等而多占耕地面积，影响粮食和工业原料作物的增产。
    虽然农药“六六六”的产量很大，用途很广，但目前销售的数量却很少，还不到它的产量的三分之一。为什么发生这种现象呢？主要原因是：一、推广工作做得不够。有些农业技术干部还不知道
  “六六六”的性能和使用方法。二、部分经销单位所定售价较高。如百分之六的可湿性“六六六”出厂价每斤九千六百五十七元，有的基层供销合作社竟卖到一万三千元到两万元。有的加工厂加工费用过大，也影响售价。三、“六六六”的规格种类太多，群众不易掌握，也妨碍普及使用。
    怎样解决这个问题呢？
    首先，要做好技术推广工作。各级农业部门，特别是专区和县农场和技术推广站的干部，都应学会使用药械防治害虫的技术，特别是要熟悉“六六六”的性能、用途、效果和具体用法。经销“六六六”的供销合作社的干部，也应该懂得这种农药的性能、用途、效果和用法等，以便结合销售进行推广工作。山东等地供销合作社的“包教、包会、包送”、“柜台兼讲台”等办法，是值得各地学习的。在没有喷雾器、喷粉器的地区，农业部门的干部还应向农民介绍布袋撒粉的办法（见五月十五日人民日报第二版）。
    第二，要降低“六六六”的价格。“六六六”原粉的定价虽已降低很多，北京、郑州等农药加工厂的利润，也由平均百分之十三点九降低到百分之三至百分之五；但是，某些基层供销社供应“六六六”的出售价格仍相当高，加工厂的包装费用也较大，因此仍不能使这种农药的价格切实降低。这些现象是应该立即纠正的。
    某些供销合作社的“六六六”售价为什么高呢？主要是由于商品流转费用大。这样的供销合作社，应该根据全国合作总社所发的“在经营药械上必须减低流转费用以减轻农民负担”的指示，切实减低流转费用。在进行这件工作中，必须减少经营层次，实行合理调运，纠正和防止按照行政区划或行政系统迂回运输的现象。这样，中间的开支就会减少很多。担任供应农药任务的基层社，应认识到做好供应农药工作就是具体地为发展工农业生产服务，积极地从改善经营和端正经营思想中，降低供应品的售价。
    加工费用为什么高呢？主要是包装费用和损耗率大。如北京药厂的包装费竟占出厂价格的百分之五十九多；郑州、湖南等加工厂，损耗率和加工包装费也很高。因此，要降低加工费用，应从提高加工技术和改进包装着手。提高加工细度，选择适当的填充料，改进可湿性“六六六”的悬浮性、粘着性，可以提高它的效用，相对地降低农民使用农药的成本。把六层牛皮纸一层布的袋装法逐步试用油布包装方法或以国产纸代替进口纸，也可以降低一些成本。农药加工厂的同志们，应当在搬运安全、花钱较少、使用方便的原则下，对包装加以研究改进。
    第三，应当适当简化“六六六”的规格。“六六六”有百分之零点五、百分之零点六五、百分之一、百分之一点四、百分之一点五、百分之二点五、百分之六和百分之六点五等七八种。目前我国农民文化水平一般较低，因此农药的规格越多就越增加推广中的困难。如去年治蝗时安徽泗洪有的农民把百分之二点五的“六六六”粉当成百分之零点五的“六六六”用了，造成浪费。根据大部地区群众使用习惯，一般对百分之零点五、百分之二点五、百分之六的“六六六”粉和百分之六的可湿性
  “六六六”比较欢迎；因此，希望加工部门在今后多生产上述规格的产品。对于飞机治蝗用的百分之一点五的“六六六”，也要按照需要的数量保证供应。
