Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 4th: Paris dispatch: The French National Assembly held a debate on the Indochina question on June 1st and 2nd. This marks the third debate by the French National Assembly on the same issue since the opening of the Geneva Conference.

The June 2nd editorial of "l'Humanité", analyzing the situation on the eve of the debate, stated: "The preliminary results of the Geneva Conference prove that peace is approaching, but this does not mean that the warmongers have abandoned their plans to sabotage the conference and expand the bloodshed. On the contrary, the achievement of these preliminary results demonstrates the strength of the forces of peace. The fact is that the conference has convened, and the People's Republic of China is present. The fact is that, due to the firmness and wisdom of the countries of the peace camp, and facing the pressure of the people of the world, the United States and its puppets have been isolated on several occasions and forced to retreat. The fact is that, despite Bidault's refusal to have any contact, representatives of the French and Vietnamese command headquarters will have to meet. This is the atmosphere in which the National Assembly begins its debate… But at this moment, Bidault and his colleagues are still doing everything possible to create new difficulties, attempting to spread the flames of war. Their actions include taking military measures and calling up conscripts ahead of schedule. Everyone can see that they want to indefinitely delay negotiations until they believe the time is right for Washington to intervene, at which point France will be placed in an unchangeable situation."

This warning from "l'Humanité" is precisely reflected in the speeches of many members of parliament over the past two days. The process of the two-day debate once again reflects the dissatisfaction of extremely broad sections of the French people with the two-faced approach of the Laniel government, which simultaneously negotiates and continues to rely on American war plans, and their desire to end the eight-year war as soon as possible and restore peace in Indochina.

Pierre Meunier, a member of parliament from the Progressive Republican Union, criticized the government for not being sincere in seeking a peaceful resolution to the Indochina issue in Geneva. He pointed out that Bidault's attitude in Geneva shifted according to the debates in the National Assembly. He pointed to Laniel on the government bench and asked: "Does the imminent call-up of the second contingent of the 1954 class of conscripts indicate that you have decided to send new detachments to Indochina?" He said that the families of the conscripts would never accept this, because they would not confuse the war in Indochina with the issue of national defense. He questioned: "Are you free to negotiate in Geneva? What constraints are there between you and the United States and the 'member states of the Federation'?" Finally, he said: "An agreement is possible. The proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam prove this. We must not miss today's opportunity."

Max Lejeune (Socialist Party) pointed out in his speech the significant casualties France had suffered in Indochina. He said that the French army was becoming increasingly depleted, and this weakness was being exploited by those who support the arming of West Germany. He also pointed out that France's economic interests in Indochina had been replaced by foreigners. Speaking of the American attitude, he said: "We accept dollars, but French youth are shedding blood; this is a losing proposition." Finally, he said: The Indochina issue "has no effective solution other than a peaceful one. The government has no right to expand the conflict. Geneva offers an opportunity for peace, and if the government misses this opportunity, it will be severely criticized by the people of the whole country."

Even Pierre André (Independent Republican Party), a member of parliament representing the interests of the Lorraine heavy industry (steel trust), openly expressed doubt about the purpose of the Indochina War. He asked: "What are we defending?" and pointed out: "It is in France's interest to end the war as soon as possible." He opposed the notion that continuing the war would bring in dollars.

Communist MP Jean Pronteau, speaking in the debate on the 1st, said:
"In the face of the necessity of a ceasefire in Geneva, which could quickly lead to a negotiated, glorious peace, Bidault seems to have bowed his head. But at the same time, he and the United States are engaged in conspiracies to expand the war, and in Paris, the government is taking emergency measures to continue the war… The opinion of the Communists and many other patriots is that the National Assembly is now at a crossroads of two paths, two policies, only one of which leads to peace. A just and lasting peace is possible and can be achieved if we want it."

Referring to the government's various claims about responsibility for the failure of the war, Pronteau pointed out: "What those who want to fight this war to the end refuse to acknowledge (and thus mislead part of public opinion) is that today, no army, no matter how capable its officers or skilled its generals, can conquer a people fighting for freedom and independence."

"Those who defend the government use the argument of so-called creating a position of strength in order to negotiate, as a pretext for all military measures, all conspiracies with the United States, and all diplomatic obstruction, and portray them as being in line with our national interests. But you know that the situation today has deteriorated to such an extent that if you do not truly create a situation of peace, the situation will sooner or later worsen. The so-called seeking peace through strength means sacrificing more lives and resources, and even sacrificing France's independence. In this part of the world, and in Africa as well, the only trump card that counts is: the desire for peace, abandoning the folly of colonialism, being as wary of the strategies of American imperialism as one would be of the plague; only in this way can we embark on a new path of friendly cooperation among all nations."

Pronteau went on to say: "Do you think Bidault, Pleven, and Laniel are not waiting for and preparing for the change in the military balance of power that they desire, regrouping troops in Hanoi, so that, as they hope, after the US congressional elections in November, it will be a prelude to large-scale intervention?"

"What trust can we have in those who have refused to negotiate twenty times? And President Ho Chi Minh has consistently proposed peace talks. Ignoring Prime Minister Nehru's appeal before the fall of Dien Bien Phu, and rejecting the Swedish government's proposal of mediation to our ambassador in Stockholm two months ago. What trust can we have in such a government? Our ambassador in Stockholm has received the immediate approval of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

"Certain ministers leading our government have damaged the independence of our own country, and continue to do so, in order to prevent the Vietnamese people from obtaining the independence they deserve. This servility to the United States does not seem enough for them; they are trying to throw our country into the European Defense Community, making German revanchists our masters."

He concluded: "Bidault must understand that due to the mediation of the Soviet Union, Great Britain and China, he should first conduct direct negotiations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, agreeing to Pham Van Dong's proposals."

"Demand a comprehensive and simultaneous ceasefire, not an intermission of the war. Cancel the emergency measures of Pleven, Laniel and Bidault. Demand the removal of these three pieces of scrap. They have long since become dangerous obstacles serving the United States. Choose a government that speaks in the name of France."

General Joinville (Communist MP), a leader of the wartime resistance movement, said in the debate on the 2nd: "The government is calling up new conscripts, mobilizing experts, and asking non-commissioned officers whose terms of service have expired to consider re-enlisting for a bonus of 75,000 francs. No one will pretend that these military measures are intended to bring victory." He said that the way to save the lives of French people in Indochina was to immediately accept a ceasefire and seek a peaceful solution. "It is up to the National Assembly, which can put pressure on the discredited Bidault… If the war in Indochina is continued regardless, it is because of the needs of the Americans, who are very afraid of facing the prospect of peace and disarmament, because they need a series of wars to maintain their war economy, and because they are not afraid of risking a world war by using others as cannon fodder."

Joinville then pointed out: Losing the opportunity to seek peace in Geneva and implementing the government's decision will be the dead end for the French army. The government's emergency measures are being taken at the same time as it is asking the National Assembly to approve the European Defense Community. "In these circumstances, where are they going to find the fourteen divisions of troops? And these fourteen divisions, they say, are to offset the twelve divisions that German revanchists will initially obtain. In any case, the continuation of the Indochina War shows that the measure of handing over military superiority in Europe to the German government will directly lead to national suicide. This is the path laid out by the American arms dealers, waiting for us to take. The French people do not want to take this path; they have long been disgusted with this dirty war. All sectors of society are demanding in unison: enough is enough, peace must be achieved in Indochina."

General Joinville finally called on the National Assembly to turn everyone's hopes into action, to reject the government's decision, which looks like a dead end from all sides, to demand that the government order the second contingent of the 1954 class of conscripts to enlist according to the original schedule, and to demobilize the first contingent of the 1953 class on July 14th of this year.

Louis Vallon (Independent) asked why the war was still being fought in Indochina, saying: "A ceasefire would cut off the source of American dollars on which our treasury relies; in addition, this war is necessary for the American economy."

He said: "French government figures have ruined France's independence… The government must stop implementing policies needed by the United States. On the contrary, the government should implement an independent policy and reach an agreement with the people of Indochina."

After two days of debate, the National Assembly adjourned on the 3rd and will resume next Tuesday (the 8th), because the 13th National Congress of the French Communist Party began on the 3rd. According to the convention of the French National Assembly, the National Assembly must adjourn during the annual meeting of a major political party in the National Assembly. According to "l'Humanité", when the National Assembly reconvenes next week, "Laniel and Bidault will speak before the vote, and the Prime Minister may introduce a vote of confidence." In the last vote of confidence, the Laniel cabinet maintained its existence by a majority of only two votes.

    法国议会辩论印度支那问题的两日情况
   【新华社日内瓦四日电】巴黎消息：法国国民议会于六月一日及二日举行了关于印度支那问题的辩论。这是日内瓦会议开幕以来，法国国民议会在同一问题上的第三次辩论了。
    二日“人道报”社论在分析这次辩论前夕的形势时说：“日内瓦会议的初步成果证明了和平业已接近，但这不是说战争贩子已经放弃了他们破坏会议和扩大流血的计划。恰恰相反，这些初步成果的取得说明和平力量的强大。事实是，会议召开了，人民中国出席了。事实是，由于和平阵营国家的坚定和英明，并面临着全世界人民的压力，美国和它的傀儡在若干场合已陷于孤立并被迫退却。事实是，尽管皮杜尔拒绝一切接触，法国和越南双方司令部的代表将不得不会面了。这就是国民议会开始辩论时的气氛……。但是就在这个时候，皮杜尔和他的同僚们却仍在尽一切力量制造新的困难，企图蔓延战火。他们的行动就是采取军事措施，提前征召新兵。每一个人都可以看到：他们想无休止地拖延谈判，一直等到他们认为华盛顿干涉的时机到来，那时法国将被放到无法改变的境况中。”
    “人道报”的这一警告，正表现在过去两天许多议员的发言中。两天辩论的过程又一次反映了法国极广泛阶层人民，对于拉尼埃政府一面谈判、一面继续依靠美国战争计划的这种两面手法的不满，和他们对尽速结束八年战争、尽速恢复印度支那的和平的渴望。
    进步共和联盟议员皮埃尔·麦尼埃在发言中，批评政府没有诚意在日内瓦求得印度支那问题的和平解决。他指出，皮杜尔在日内瓦的态度是随着国民议会的辩论而转移的。他指着政府阁员席上的拉尼埃问道：“即将征召一九五四年级第二批新兵一事，是否表明你们已经决定派新的分遣队到印度支那去呢？”他说：新兵的家庭决不会接受，因为他们不会把印度支那的战争和国防问题混为一谈。他追问道：“你们在日内瓦有谈判的自由吗？你们和美国以及‘联邦成员国’之间有什么约束吗？”最后他说：“协议是可能的。越南民主共和国的建议就证明了这一点。我们决不能错过今天的机会。”
    马克斯·勒荣纳（社会党）在发言中指出法国在印度支那的重大伤亡。他说，法国军队已日益枯竭，这个弱点正被支持武装西德者所利用。他又指出，法国在印度支那的经济利益已被外国人所代替。谈到美国的态度时，他说：“我们接受金元，可是法国青年在流血，这是得不偿失的事。”最后他说：印度支那问题“除了和平解决之外，没有其他有效的解决办法。政府没有权力扩大冲突。日内瓦提供了和平的机会，如果政府错过这个机会，必将遭到全国人民的严厉指责。”
    甚至代表洛林重工业（钢铁托拉斯）方面利益的议员皮埃尔·安德烈（独立共和党）也对印度支那战争的目的何在，公开表示怀疑。他问道：“我们在保卫什么？”并指出：“法国的利益在于尽速结束战争。”他反对认为继续战争可以得到美元的说法。
    共产党议员让·普朗多在一日辩论中发言说：
  “在日内瓦在一个可能迅速签订的并为光荣和平的谈判打开道路的停火底必要性面前，皮杜尔似乎低了头。但是在这同时，他和美国又在进行企图把战事扩大的阴谋，并且在巴黎，政府正采取紧急的措施借以继续战争……，共产党人和其他许多爱国者的意见是：国民议会现在正处在两条道路、两个政策的十字路口，其中只有一条路通向和平。而一个公正而持久的和平是可能的，只要我们想要，就可以取得。”
    普朗多在提到政府人士关于战争失败的责任的种种说法时指出：“那些想把这个战争打到底的人所拒绝承认（从而也迷惑一部分舆论）的事情，乃是：任何军队那怕军官的能力如何，将军的本领如何，在今天，要想征服一个为自由和独立而斗争的人民，是决不可能的了。”
    “替政府辩护的人把一种所谓创造实力情势以便谈判的说法，作为一切军事措施、一切与美国的密谋、一切外交上的阻挠的借口，并把它们说成是符合我们的民族利益似的。可是你们知道，今日的局势已经恶化到这样地步，如果你们不真正地去造成和平情势，这样的局势迟早会更加恶化。所谓用实力求取和平，这就是牺牲更多生命和资源，以至牺牲法国的独立。在世界的这一部分，在非洲也是一样，唯一算数的王牌只是：愿望和平，放弃殖民者的愚蠢行为，要像对付瘟疫一样地当心美帝国主义的战略，只有这样才能走上各国人民友好合作的新的道路。”
    普朗多接着说：“你们以为皮杜尔、普利文和拉尼埃不是正在等待和准备他们所愿望的军事力量对比的变化，在河内重新集结部队，以便如他们所希望的在十一月美国国会选举以后，便将是一个大规模干涉的前奏吗？”
    “对于那些曾二十次拒绝谈判的人们，我们能有什么信任呢？而胡志明主席一直不断提议谈判和平。在奠边府失守之前不理睬尼赫鲁总理的呼吁，而且在两月前拒绝瑞典政府向我驻斯德哥尔摩大使提议斡旋。对于这样的政府，我们能有什么信任呢？我国驻斯德哥尔摩大使已收到越南民主共和国立即的赞同。”
    “某些领导我们政府的部长们，为要阻止越南人民获得他们应得的独立，已损害了我们自己国家的独立，并还在继续这样做。对美国的这种奴颜婢膝，对他们似乎还不够，他们正试图把我们的国家投入欧洲防务集团中去，让德国复仇分子做我们的主人。”
    他在结语中指出：“皮杜尔必须了解由于苏联、英国和中国的斡旋，他首先应与越南民主共和国进行直接谈判，同意范文同的建议。”
    “要求一个全面的同时的停火，而不是战争的间歇。取消普利文、拉尼埃和皮杜尔的紧急措施。要求赶走这三个废料。他们很久以来已变成为美国服务的危险的障碍。选择一个以法国名义讲话的政府。”
    战时抵抗运动将领儒恩维尔将军（共产党议员）在二日辩论中说：“政府正在征召新兵，动员专家，要求服役期满的士官考虑七万五千法郎奖励金重新服役。这一切军事措施的用意何在，没有人会装着说这些办法会带来胜利的。”他说，挽救在印度支那的法国人生命的办法，是立即接受停火和寻求和平解决。“这要依靠国民议会，它可以对没有信用的皮杜尔施加压力……如果不管一切去继续进行印度支那的战争，那是因为美国人的需要，美国人非常害怕面临和平与裁军的前景，因为他们需要一连串的战争以维持其战争经济，因为他们不怕用别人去替死的办法冒世界大战的危险。”
    儒恩维尔接着指出：失去在日内瓦求得和平的机会，执行政府的决定，将是法国军队的死路。而政府这些紧急措施，正是它要求国民议会批准欧洲防务集团的时候采取的。“在这些情况之下，他们到那里去找十四师军队呢？而这十四师，说是去抵消德国复仇主义者将初步获得的十二师的。不管怎样说法，印度支那战争的继续就表明：在欧洲把军事上的优势送给德国政府的措施，将直接引向民族自杀。这是美国军火商布置好了并且等着我们去走的道路。法国人民不要走这条道路，他们早就厌恶这场肮脏战争。社会各阶层都同声要求：够了，和平一定要在印度支那实现。”
    儒恩维尔将军最后号召国民议会把大家的希望化为行动，拒绝执行从各方面看来都是绝路的政府决定，要求政府命令一九五四年级第二批新兵按照原定期限入伍，把一九五三年级第一批的在今年七月十四日复员。
    路易·伐隆（无党派）问为何战争仍在印度支那进行时说道：“停火就会使我们国库所依靠的美金来源断绝，此外，这个战争对美国经济是必需的。”
    他说：“法国的政府人物已经断送了法国的独立……政府必须停止执行美国需要的政策。相反地，政府应当执行一个独立的政策，与印度支那人民达成协议。”
    国民议会经两天辩论后于三日起休会，到下星期二（八日）继续举行，这是因为法国共产党第十三次代表大会于三日起开会。按法国国民议会惯例，在国民议会大政党召开年会期间，国民议会必须休会。据“人道报”讯：国民议会在下周重新辩论时，“在表决之前拉尼埃与皮杜尔将发言，而且内阁总理可能提出信任案。”在上次信任案投票时，拉尼埃内阁仅以两票的多数维持其存在。
