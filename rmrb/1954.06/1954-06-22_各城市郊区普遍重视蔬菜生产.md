Farmers in the suburban areas of various cities are generally emphasizing vegetable production, and are now actively improving cultivation techniques and increasing the variety of vegetables to meet the needs of urban people.

In order to guarantee supply, various locations have expanded the cultivated area. According to statistics from eleven major cities including Beijing, Xi'an, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, the vegetable planting area this year has increased by approximately 11% compared to last year. In the entire Northeast region, a total of 7,050,000 mu of vegetables were planted in urban and suburban areas this year, an increase of more than 1,890,000 mu compared to last year. Due to the universal attention paid to increasing fertilizer application, preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, and expanding irrigation areas, the yield per unit area of vegetables this year will be higher than last year. According to statistics from eleven major cities, the output of suburban vegetables can reach 4.2 billion jin, an increase of 700 million jin compared to last year.

Various locations particularly emphasize increasing the variety of vegetables to solve the problem of vegetable shortages during the off-season. Northern cities generally focus on solving the shortage of vegetables in winter and spring. For example, the Northeast region is universally expanding the area of irrigated land and promoting production techniques such as hotbed seedling cultivation to increase the types of planting and advance the date of market availability. Farmers in the suburbs of Shenyang, Dalian, and other cities plan to dig more than 1,000 wells. The area for hotbed seedling cultivation in the suburbs of Harbin has increased by about 50% compared to last year. Southern suburban areas focus on solving the shortage of vegetables in summer. For example, Nanjing sets up shade sheds in areas with suitable conditions to grow midsummer vegetables, and Wuhan pays attention to aquatic vegetables to alleviate the difficulty of vegetable shortages in July.

Vegetable production cooperatives in urban suburban areas have also developed greatly. There are already more than 120 in the suburbs of Beijing, about double the number of last year. There are more than 360 in the suburbs of various cities in the Northeast, five times more than last year. Due to the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in vegetable areas, vegetable production can gradually move towards planned production according to needs.

    各城市郊区普遍重视蔬菜生产
    各城市郊区农民普遍重视蔬菜生产，现正积极改进栽培技术，增加蔬菜种类，以适应城市人民的需要。
    为了保证供应，各地都扩大了栽培面积。据北京、西安、重庆、上海、广州等十一个大城市的统计，今年蔬菜种植面积约比去年增加百分之十一。东北全区城郊今年共种蔬菜七百零五万亩，比去年增加了一百八十九万多亩。由于各地普遍注意增施肥料、防治病虫害、扩大灌溉面积，今年蔬菜单位面积产量将比去年提高。据十一个大城市的统计，郊区蔬菜产量可达四十二亿斤，比去年增产七亿斤。
    各地特别重视增加蔬菜种类，以解决淡季蔬菜不足的问题。北方城市一般多着重解决冬春蔬菜的不足，如东北区普遍扩大水浇地面积，推广温床育苗等生产技术，以增加种植种类和提早上市日期。沈阳、旅大等市郊农民计划打井一千多眼。哈尔滨市郊温床育苗较去年增加百分之五十左右。南方市郊着重解决夏季蔬菜的不足，如南京市在有条件地区搭设荫棚，种植伏天蔬菜，武汉市注意水生蔬菜，以调剂七月间缺菜困难。
    城市郊区的蔬菜生产合作社也有很大发展，北京市郊区已有一百二十多个，约比去年增加一倍，东北各城市郊区已有三百六十多个，比去年增加五倍。由于菜区互助合作运动的发展，蔬菜生产就可以按照需要，逐步走向计划生产。
