Find More Minerals to Build a Great Motherland
    Wang Renmin, Second-year Student of Mineral Geology and Exploration Specialization, Beijing Institute of Geology

    In the past two years of study, we have been exposed to a lot of scientific knowledge about geology, from the ancient times when trilobites roamed to the appearance of modern North China people; from the immeasurably large universe to fossils so small that they can only be seen under a microscope; from heavy drilling machines to delicate instruments; from observing rocks with a magnifying glass to identifying ores with ultraviolet light. We have spent two years of happy school life in a wealth of knowledge.

    Last year, we did field practice in Zhoukoudian. Every time we took a lunch break, villagers would always gather around to ask questions, inquiring whether we had found any minerals; but because we had not yet mastered our skills, our task was not to search for minerals, so we could not satisfy their eagerness. Whenever we stopped at the entrance of a village, children would shout, "The treasure hunters are here!" and soon many people would come to warmly welcome us. Our mood was the same as the villagers. When we found that our work was even slightly related to "minerals," it would give us great encouragement.

    After returning from the field practice, the students intensified their studies, hoping to participate in mineral exploration work as soon as possible. When participating in the parade on "May Day" this year, the students said happily: "Today we are dressed as exploration teams to participate in the parade. Soon, we will be inspected by Chairman Mao as real exploration team members."

    Now we are about to graduate. Our production internship is to participate in the mineral prospecting work of the Central Geological Department, truly "going to find minerals." Our mood is the same as that of pilots preparing to participate in their first flight, nervous and excited. In the new life that is about to begin, we will definitely encounter many difficulties, but we are determined to overcome any difficulties, learn humbly, and find more minerals for the motherland.

    找出更多的矿产建设伟大的祖国
    北京地质学院矿产地质勘查专修科二年级学生  王仁民
    两年来的学习中，我们接触了地质方面的许多科学知识，从三叶虫横行的亘古年代到近代华北人的出现；从大得难以捉摸的宇宙到小得要用显微镜才能看到的化石；从笨重的钻探机到精细的仪器；从用放大镜观察岩石到用紫外线鉴定矿石。在内容丰富的学识中，我们幸福地度过了两年的学校生活。
    去年，我们在周口店作野外实习。每到中午休息的时候，总有老乡们围上来问长问短，打听我们找到矿没有；但因为我们还没有学好本领，我们的任务还不是找寻矿产，无法满足他们的渴望。每当我们停在一个村口时，小孩子嚷着“找宝的来啦！”不一会儿就会有很多人来热情地招待我们。我们的心情也是和老乡们一样，当我们发现自己的工作即便是和“矿”有一点关系时，也会给我们很大的鼓舞。
    野外实习回来以后，同学们都加紧学习，盼望着能早点去参加找矿工作。今年“五一”节参加游行时，同学们高兴地说：“今天我们化装成勘探队来参加游行，不久，我们将以真正勘探队员的身份来接受毛主席的检阅。”
    现在我们快毕业了，我们的生产实习是参加中央地质部的矿产普查工作，真正是“找矿去”了。我们的心情，和飞行员准备参加第一次起飞的心情一样，紧张而又兴奋。在即将开始的新的生活里，一定会遇到许多困难，但我们有决心克服任何困难，虚心学习，为祖国找出更多的矿产。
