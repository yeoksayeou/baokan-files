The True Face of American "Aid"

    After the Korean armistice, the United States, under the guise of "rehabilitating" South Korea, advertised that it would provide the Syngman Rhee clique with two dollar "aid" packages before June of this year: one was $200 million from the United States; the other was $117 million jointly contributed by the United States and other countries that participated in the Korean War. However, to date, none of the US's puppet states have contributed a single penny, and the majority of the US's $200 million "aid" is used for military expenditures. The remainder is merely surplus American goods that South Korea does not need. This kind of "aid" brings not "rehabilitation" but even deeper disaster. As a result of developing military industries and dumping surplus American goods, South Korea's economy has now collapsed. The production volume of the metal industry only accounts for 7.3% of the pre-war level, the chemical industry only accounts for 11.8% of the pre-war level, and the food industry only accounts for 19.7% of the pre-war level. Unemployed people who have nowhere to turn can be seen everywhere in the cities. By February of this year, prices in South Korea had risen more than 136 times compared to 1947 (Soviet "Pravda", April 13th).

    In addition, the "United Nations Civil Assistance Command Korea (UNCACK)" that the United States has set up in various cities under the name of "aid" not only controls South Korea's finance, fiscal affairs, and food sectors, but even the purchase of train tickets and the issuance of Han River crossing permits are manipulated by it.

Hypocrisy and Decay

    Not long ago, 4,000 tons of flour were shipped to South Korea from the United States in exchange for South Korea's export of 270,000 tons of high-quality rice. However, the flour was completely moldy. At a press conference, someone asked the South Korean puppet government's "Minister of Agriculture" Nam Bo-song (transliteration) what use these scraps were, but he avoided answering directly and vaguely said: "Try to stop the flour from rotting..."

    As everyone knows, it is impossible to "stop rotting" flour that has already rotted. From this incident, we can see the hypocrisy of the American "benefactors" and the decay of the South Korean puppet government!

The Threat of Unemployment and Hunger

    Under the brutal exploitation of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, the lives of the South Korean people are becoming more and more miserable. At present, the average monthly salary of South Korean railway workers is only 200 to 300 hwan of counterfeit currency, which is far from enough to maintain their minimum living standards; and workers in sectors such as docks and coal mines cannot receive even this minimum amount on time, or they simply cannot receive it at all. According to the "Rodong Sinmun" in Pyongyang, in early March this year, there were more than 240,000 people in extreme poverty in Busan, a city with a population of 600,000. Among the more than 80,000 disaster victims on Geoje Island, 30% are on the verge of starvation. In rural areas, the suffering of farmers is no less than that of workers. This year, the area of ​​paddy fields in South Korea has been reduced to 75% of the pre-war level, and the area of ​​dry land has been reduced to 67% of the pre-war level. More than 3.21 million farmers in rural areas have gone bankrupt. However, the annual burden of South Korean farmers accounts for 80% of the Syngman Rhee clique's taxes. According to a survey by the pseudo-"Korean Financial Cooperative Federation", at the beginning of this year, among more than 2.1 million farm households in South Korea, each household had an average debt of 1,034 hwan and 60 jeon. Indebted farmers are subjected to monthly interest of 3% usury. Many farmers are forced to sell their green crops due to debt. South Korea, which has always been known as the "granary" of Korea, is short of 3.25 million seok of grain this year (each seok is 150 to 180 kilograms), but in order to carry out the orders of its American masters, the Syngman Rhee clique still has to forcibly collect 3 million seok of grain and transport it to Japan.

Fishermen Are Not Free to Fish

    In famous fishing grounds such as Chilbosan in South Korea, the fish in the sea have been scared away due to the continuous military exercises of the US military. April and May are a rare fishing season near Chilbosan, and tens of thousands of fishermen rely on this fishing season to catch some fish to maintain their lives for a longer period. However, their lives are now under great threat. In the fishing grounds near Geoje Island, Jeju Island, and Bongam Island, the US military uses "military needs" as an excuse to prohibit local fishermen from going to sea even at ordinary times (when there are no exercises). Even along the coast of South Korea, South Korean fishermen must purchase so-called "fishing permits" from the US military before they are allowed to fish. Many fishermen have to risk their lives to go to remote islands to fish and earn a living because they do not have the money to buy this "permit."

    Fishermen having to obtain American "permission" to fish in their own country's territorial waters is another example of the "freedom" and "independence" that the United States gives to South Korea.

Syngman Rhee Wants to "Throw Away" the Korean Script

    On March 27, Syngman Rhee issued a so-called "talk on correcting the national script (referring to the Korean script)", clamoring that "those things called grammar and orthography should all be thrown away!"

    As early as November 5 last year, the Syngman Rhee puppet government, under the guise of "simplifying Korean orthography," promulgated a so-called "Korean Orthography Reform Order"; and for the same purpose, it also organized a so-called "Korean Language Sub-Committee". However, due to strong opposition from the people, this "Reform Order" has not been implemented. Therefore, Syngman Rhee became angry and dismissed the pseudo-government's "Minister of Education", who was the "Chairman" of the "National Language Deliberation Council" and the "Korean Language Sub-Committee", and ridiculously announced that whoever could strictly implement the "Reform Order" would be allowed to be the "Minister of Education". As a result, the position of "Minister of Education" was occupied by the secret agent Li Xuan-gen, who "stood up" to destroy the Korean script.

    Why does Syngman Rhee want to "throw away" the grammar and orthography of the long-standing Korean script? This is naturally inseparable from his American masters. The United States began to discriminate against the Korean language as early as the initial occupation of southern Korea. Article 5 of the then "Proclamation of the Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific" openly stipulated: "During the military administration period, English shall be the common language used for all purposes. In case of unclear or different interpretations or definitions between English and Korean or Japanese, English shall prevail." Syngman Rhee, of course, had to flatter this kind of discrimination, so he shamelessly said in his "talk": "Although Americans and British people want to learn Korean characters in order to read Korean newspapers, it is too difficult to learn because it is too deep..."

    美国魔爪下的南朝鲜
    美“援”的真面目
    朝鲜停战后，美国打着“复兴”南朝鲜的幌子，宣传说要在今年六月以前，给李承晚匪帮两项美元“援助”：一项是由美国拿出两亿美元；另一项是由美国和其他侵朝国家共同拿出一亿一千七百万美元。但是，到现在为止，美国的仆从国家没有一国拿出一文钱来，而美国两亿元的“援助”，大部分是用作军事开支，其余部分也只是一些南朝鲜不需要的美国剩余商品。这种“援助”带来的不是“复兴”而是更加深重的灾难。由于发展军事工业和美国剩余商品倾销的结果，现在南朝鲜的经济已经崩溃了，那里金属工业生产量只占战前百分之七点三，化学工业只占战前百分之十一点八，食品工业只占战前百分之十九点七；城市里随处可见走头无路的失业者，到今年二月为止，南朝鲜的物价比一九四七年上涨了一百三十六倍多（四月十三日苏联“真理报”）。
    此外，美国以“援助”为名在各个城市设置的“联合国军民事处”，不仅控制了南朝鲜的金融、财政和粮食等部门，连车票的购买和汉江渡河证的签发也都操纵在它手里。
      伪善和腐朽
    不久前从美国运到南朝鲜四千吨面粉，这是用来交换南朝鲜输出的二十七万吨上等大米的。然而，这些面粉完全霉烂了。在记者招待会上，有人问南朝鲜傀儡政府的“农业部长官”南宝松（译音）这些废物有什么用，他却避免正面的答复，含糊地说：“设法停止面粉的霉烂……”
    大家知道，“停止霉烂”已经霉烂的面粉是不可能的事情。从这件事可以看出：美国“援助者”的伪善和南朝鲜傀儡政府的腐朽到了何等的地步！
      失业和饥饿的威胁
    在美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮残暴的榨取下，南朝鲜人民的生活越来越悲惨了。现在，南朝鲜铁路工人平均每人每月的工资不过二百圜到三百圜的伪币，远不够维持他们的最低生活；而码头和煤矿等部门的工人，连这个最低的数字也不能按时领到，或者就根本领不到了。据平壤“劳动新闻”记载，今年三月初，在六十万人口的釜山市内，赤贫的人竟达到二十四万多名。巨济岛的八万多灾民中，有百分之三十已到了要饿死的境地。在乡村，农民遭受的痛苦并不下于工人，今年南朝鲜水田面积已减少到战前的百分之七十五，旱田减少到战前的百分之六十七，农村里破产的农民已达到三百二十一万多人，但是，南朝鲜农民每年的负担，竟占李承晚匪帮税金的百分之八十。据伪“大韩金融组合联盟会”的调查，今年年初，在南朝鲜二百一十多万农户中，每户平均负债一千零三十四圜六十钱，负债的农民每月要受月息三分高利贷的剥削，很多农民被债务逼得把青苗都出卖了。一向被称为朝鲜“谷仓”的南朝鲜，今年缺粮达三百二十五万石（每石为一百五十到一百八十公斤），但李承晚匪帮为了执行美国主子的命令，还要强征三百万石粮食运往日本。
      渔民捕鱼不自由
    在南朝鲜著名的渔场七山等地，因为美国军队不断地演习，那里海面上的游鱼都被惊散了。四、五月份本是七山附近海面上一年难得的鱼汛期，好几万渔民都靠着这个鱼汛期捕点鱼来维持他们一个较长期的生活，但是，他们现在的生活已受到很大的威胁。在巨济岛、济州岛和蜂岩岛等岛屿附近的渔场上，美军借口“军事需要”，连平时（不演习的时候）也不准当地渔民下海。就是沿南朝鲜海岸一带，南朝鲜的渔民，必须向美军购买了所谓“捕鱼许可证”后，才准许捕鱼。很多渔民因为没钱购买这个“许可证”，不得不冒着生命的危险，到远离海岸的孤岛去捕鱼谋生。
    渔民在自己国家的领海里捕鱼还要美国的“许可”，这也是美国给予南朝鲜的“自由”和“独立”的一例。
      李承晚要“抛掉”朝鲜文字
    三月二十七日，李承晚发表了所谓“关于矫正国文（指朝鲜文字）的谈话”，叫嚷着“那些什么叫做文法呀、缀字法呀的东西，统统给抛掉！”
    去年十一月五日，李承晚伪政府就在“国文缀字法简易化”的幌子下，公布过所谓“国文缀字法改革令”；并且为了同样的目的，又组织了一个所谓“国文分科委员会”。然而由于人民的猛烈反对，这个“改革令”一直没有行得通。因此，李承晚老羞成怒，把担任“国语审议会”和“国文分科委员会”的“委员长”的伪政府“文教部长官”撤了职，并且荒唐地宣布说，谁要能厉行“改革令”，就让他当“文教部长官”。结果，这个“文教部长官”的位子就被为破坏朝鲜文字“挺身而出”的特务分子李暄根占据了。
    李承晚为什么要把历史悠久的朝鲜文的文法和缀字法“统统给抛掉”呢？这自然和他的美国主人分不开，美国早在占领朝鲜南部初期就开始歧视朝鲜的语言文字了。当时的“太平洋总司令部布告”第五条就公开规定：“军政期间，一律以英语为使用于一切目的之公用语。倘遇英语与朝语、日语之间解释、定义不明者或不同者，均以英语为基准。”对于这种歧视，李承晚当然得加以奉承，所以他在
  “谈话”中竟无耻地说：“美国人和英国人虽然想学韩国字，以便阅读韩国报纸，可是太深了，很难学……”
