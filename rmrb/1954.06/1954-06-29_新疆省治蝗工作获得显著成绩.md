Xinjiang Province has achieved significant results in locust control work. As of May 31, the Soviet Locust Control Team had dispatched 13 aircraft in seven counties including Shawan, Manas, Hutubi, Urumqi, Fukang, Qitai, and Barkol, flying a total of 3,565 sorties. According to incomplete statistics at the end of May, the total treated area reached 37,144 hectares (one hectare equals 15 mu). Among them, the area treated by aircraft was 27,044 hectares, and the area treated by ground-based machinery, chemicals, and manual labor was 10,100 hectares. During the control process, thanks to the patient guidance of Soviet experts and technicians, the control technology has been continuously improved and enhanced. According to the inspection 72 hours after spraying, the killing efficiency of poison bait generally reaches 80% to 90%; in areas where powder spraying is done effectively, the killing rate also reaches over 90%. At present, the threat of locust plagues has been basically eliminated in farmland and areas near farmland in Manas County and other places.

    新疆省治蝗工作获得显著成绩
    新疆省治蝗工作已获得显著成绩。截至五月三十一日，苏联灭蝗团已在沙湾、玛纳斯、呼图壁、乌鲁木齐、阜康、奇台、巴里坤等七县出动十三架飞机，共飞行三千五百六十五架次。根据五月底不完全统计，总防治面积共达三万七千一百四十四公顷（一公顷是十五亩）。其中飞机防治面积有两万七千零四十四公顷，地面药械及人工防治一万零一百公顷。在防治中，由于苏联专家及技术人员的耐心指导，使防治技术不断得到改进和提高。根据撒药以后七十二小时的检查，毒饵的杀伤效率一般可达到百分之八十到九十；喷粉得法的地区杀伤率也达到百分之九十以上。目前，玛纳斯县等地的农田和农田附近，已经基本上消除了蝗灾的威胁。
