    A Powerful Guarantee for Scientific Development
    Liang Xi, Chairman of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization
    The publication of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China is a major event in our lives. The Draft Constitution reflects the ideals that the people of the whole country have dreamed of for many years. For this ideal, thousands upon thousands of people have dedicated their most precious blood and lives.
    Before liberation, we could not smell a trace of democratic freedom in our lives. We only saw our students and friends being harmed by the reactionaries. We only saw dark politics. The older we got, the deeper our experience, the more pain we felt. Today, I see the new atmosphere of the motherland, I see such a democratic Draft Constitution, and I see the realization of my own and the common aspirations of the people of the whole country, and I feel particularly excited.
    The Draft Constitution states that after the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, exploitation and poverty can be eliminated and a socialist society can be built through peaceful means.
    The Draft Constitution states that our country attaches great importance to science and scientific workers, so it specifically stipulates the protection of citizens' freedom to conduct scientific research, and encourages and helps creative work in science. This foreshadows the unlimited development prospects of science in our country, and it is a great encouragement to us scientific workers.
    The Draft Constitution states that the state is very concerned about the people's cultural life. It mentions that various schools and other cultural institutions should be gradually expanded so that the people of the whole country can receive education. Special provisions are made for the development of youth's intelligence and women's cultural life. Therefore, it is also our scientific workers' unshirkable responsibility to actively participate in various cultural activities led by state organs and improve the people's scientific knowledge level.
    In countries under imperialist rule, not only are those who uphold justice and participate in the peace movement persecuted, but even those who agree with and study the theories of Pavlov and Michurin are not tolerated by the reactionary rulers. In the United States, it is even legally forbidden to study and teach Darwin's theory of evolution. Last year, the US government persecuted the scientific worker Rosenberg, and this year they are preparing to persecute the famous atomic energy scientist Oppenheimer. Therefore, the Draft Constitution stipulates that foreigners who have been persecuted for upholding the cause of peace, participating in the peace movement, or engaging in scientific work shall be granted the right of residence. We scientific workers especially feel the great significance of this point.
    In short, the Draft Constitution fully demonstrates its democratic, constructive, and peaceful nature, and it is in line with the aspirations of the broad masses of the people.

    科学发展的有力保证
    中华全国科学技术普及协会主席  梁希
    中华人民共和国宪法草案的公布，是我们生活中的重大事件。宪法草案反映了多少年来全国人民梦寐以求的理想，为了这个理想，千千万万的人民曾献出了最宝贵的鲜血和生命。
    解放前我们在生活中嗅不到一点民主自由的气息，我们只看见我们的学生和朋友，受到反动派的残害，我们只看见黑暗的政治，年纪越老，阅历越深，痛苦就越多。今天我看到祖国的新气象，看到这样民主的宪法草案，看到自己和全国人民的共同愿望的实现，格外觉得兴奋。
    宪法草案表示：中国人民革命胜利后，可通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困，建成社会主义社会。
    宪法草案表示：我们的国家十分重视科学和科学工作者，所以具体规定了保障公民进行科学研究的自由，鼓励和帮助从事科学的创造性的工作。这就预示了科学在我国的无限发展的前途，对于我们科学工作者是很大的鼓励。
    宪法草案表示：国家对人民文化生活非常关怀，里面提到要逐步扩大各种学校和其他文化机关，使全国人民都能受到教育；对青年智力的发展和妇女文化的生活，更作了特别规定。因此，积极参加国家机关所领导的各种文化活动，提高人民的科学知识水平，也是我们科学工作者义不容辞的责任。
    在帝国主义统治的国家里，不但拥护正义参加和平运动的人们受到了迫害，就是赞同和研究巴甫洛夫、米丘林学说的人们，也为反动统治者所不容。在美国甚至还用法律禁止学习和讲授达尔文进化论。去年美国政府残害了科学工作者卢森堡，今年他们又准备迫害著名的研究原子能的科学家奥本海迈。因此，宪法草案中规定对于任何由于拥护和平事业，参加和平运动，进行科学工作而受到迫害的外国人，给以居留的权利。这一点我们科学工作者特别感到它的重大意义。
    总之，宪法草案充分表现了它的民主性、建设性和和平性，是符合于广大人民的愿望的。
