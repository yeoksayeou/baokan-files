The East China Administrative Council's Culture Bureau recently held the "East China Chinese Music Concert." The representatives from various provinces and cities participating in the performance were all well-known national music performers and outstanding folk artists from various regions. The instruments played included nine types: guqin, zheng, pipa, xiao, erhu, flute, sheng, suona, and guanzi. There were a total of sixty-six programs.

In the ancient music section, the program included over twenty ancient pieces such as "Flowing Water Tune" composed by Boya of the Spring and Autumn period, "Scratching Head and Questioning the Sky" by Qu Yuan of the Warring States period, "Three Variations on the Plum Blossom" by Heng Yi of the Jin Dynasty, "Ambush from Ten Sides" by Qin Hanzi of the Sui Dynasty, "Green Lotus Music Bureau" by Li Bai of the Tang Dynasty, and "Fisherman and Woodcutter's Dialogue" by Yang Xifeng of the Ming Dynasty. In addition, there were Buddhist music, Kunqu Opera, and Southern music from Fujian. The performers, with different styles and excellent skills, presented these excellent ancient musical treasures, demonstrating the artistic achievements of Chinese classical music and the richness of Chinese national music heritage. In the performance of ancient musical instruments, there were also programs expressing modern life, such as "Beautiful Youth" and "Brave Warrior," which demonstrated the future development of national instrumental music.

In the folk instrumental music section, there was the "Four-Character Tune Xiaokaimen" of ancient Central Plains music, imitations of folk operas such as "Si Prefecture Opera" and "Henan Bangzi," as well as general folk music such as "Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix," "Little Shepherd Boy," and "Yangzhou Kaimen." These programs have been popular among the masses for a long time and are enjoyed by the masses. The folk artists' outstanding performance ability and playing skills portrayed sincere, bright, and beautiful musical images of the people, expressing the healthy, upward, and optimistic thoughts and emotions of the people.

Northeast Trains Heads and Directors of Drama and Opera Troupes

The Northeast Administrative Council's Culture Bureau entrusted the Northeast People's Art Theater and the Northeast Opera Research Institute to respectively hold training classes for heads and directors of drama troupes and training classes for heads and directors of opera troupes. Both training classes have begun. There are seventy-eight participants in the opera troupe heads and directors training class, including heads, directors, and editors from twenty-two state-owned opera (Ping, Beijing) troupes and some locally-run and privately-run publicly-assisted troupes, most of whom are opera artist cadres. The courses in the training class include reports on directing work, actor art, opera style, stage art, and other relevant specialized issues. The purpose is to enable the heads and directors of opera troupes to initially master directing theory through learning, combine it with the characteristics of opera to establish and improve the directing system; at the same time, to use correct attitudes and scientific directing methods to sort out and develop opera art, and improve the overall professional level and performance quality of the troupe. The training class for heads and directors of drama troupes mainly includes forty-nine people, including heads and directors of fourteen state-owned drama troupes in the Northeast region, and heads or directors of professional cultural work troupes from coal mines, railways, forests, troops, and other units. In addition to the directing course as the main content, and the selection of scripts focusing on the study of how directors conduct desk work, there are also special reports on socialist realism, how to experience life, actor art, and stage art.

Before the start of the training class, the Northeast Culture Bureau organized a forum for the participating heads and directors to report and exchange experiences related to the work of the troupes. It further clarified that the troupes should strengthen artistic practice through performances, improve performing arts, improve the ideological content of the performed repertoire, and educate the audience with socialist patriotism to serve the overall task of the country during the transition period.
