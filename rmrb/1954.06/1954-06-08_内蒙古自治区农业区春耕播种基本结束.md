	Spring planting work in the agricultural areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has now largely concluded, with the exception of a few late-season crops.
	The area sown with wheat throughout the region generally exceeded planned targets. The area sown with oilseed crops approached planned figures, and the planting of other crops was completed according to plan. The Hetao Administrative Region is one of the grain-producing areas in the west. Last year, over 1,110,000 mu of wheat were planted. This year's planned sown area was 1,230,000 mu, with an actual completion of over 1,250,000 mu, exceeding the plan. Furthermore, sparse sowing and dense planting were implemented on 69.1% of the area, more than five times that of last year. It is estimated that the plan to sow 350,000 mu of flax will also be completed. In addition, a portion of sunflowers was also sown. In the Chahar League, wheat exceeded the plan by 19.2%.
	Judging from the sowing conditions of various crops that have already been planted, the quality of this year's spring planting is better than in previous years. This is reflected in improvements in soil covering and fertilization techniques, with a reduction in superficial fertilization and excessive soil covering. Land preparation work such as harrowing has also been more refined than in previous years. Seed selection and sun-drying have become more common, and the cultivation area of rust-resistant wheat varieties has been expanded. Planned control and technical instruction were carried out in advance for seed dressing with chemicals. The sowing date of flax was generally five to ten days earlier than in previous years. In key cooperatives and groups under the guidance of technical promotion stations, cultivation conditions were also appropriately improved, and dense planting was tested.

    内蒙古自治区农业区春耕播种基本结束
    内蒙古自治区春耕播种工作，目前除少数晚田作物外，大部已经结束。
    全区播种小麦一般都超过计划，油料作物接近计划数字，其他作物能按计划完成。河套行政区是西部的产粮区之一。去年种小麦一百一十一万余亩。今年计划播种面积是一百二十三万亩，完成一 百二十五万余亩，超过了计划，并有百分之六十九点一的面积实行了疏播密植，等于去年的五倍多。胡麻计划种三十五万亩，估计也能完成。另外还播种了一部分向日葵。察哈尔盟小麦超过计划百分之十九点二。
    从已下种的各种作物的播种情况看，今年的春耕质量要比往年好。表现在铺土施肥的技术有了改进，减少了擦粉式的施肥和过量铺土现象；耙耱等整地工作也比往年精细；选种和晒种的已较为普遍，同时还扩大了耐锈品种小麦的栽培面积；药剂拌种工作，事先有计划地进行了控制和技术传授；胡麻的播种日期，一般比往年提前了五天到十天，在技术推广站指导下的重点社、组，还适当地改善了栽培条件，试行了密植。
