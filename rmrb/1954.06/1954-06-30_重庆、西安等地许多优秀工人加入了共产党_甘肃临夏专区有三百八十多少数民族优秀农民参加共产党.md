    Chongqing, Xi'an and Other Places Have Many Outstanding Workers Join the Communist Party
    Gansu Linxia Prefecture Has 380+ Excellent Farmers of Minority Nationalities Join the Communist Party
    Xinhua News Agency: In Chongqing, Xi'an, Zhengzhou and other cities, many outstanding workers have joined the Communist Party of China.
    From July 1953 to May of this year, over 6,200 outstanding workers in factories and mining enterprises in Chongqing joined the Communist Party of China. Currently, Communist Party members in factories and mining enterprises in Chongqing account for 9.7% of the city’s total workforce, and 15.73% of the city’s engineering and technical personnel have become glorious Communist Party members. According to statistics from 45 large factories, 50% of all Party members are veteran technical workers with more than ten years of service. In Xi'an, more than 800 outstanding employees in various factories joined the Party in the year since July 1, 1953. According to statistics up to June 22nd, the number of Communist Party members among construction workers in Zhengzhou has increased thirteenfold compared to the end of May 1953. At the end of May last year, there was only one Communist Party member for every 500 workers, but now there is one Party member for every 40 workers. Over 90% of these Communist Party members are technical workers with many years of production experience.
    The employees who were admitted to the Party in these three cities are all advanced figures in production or work and have made significant achievements in production or work. Among all labor models in 45 large factories in Chongqing, 34.4% are Communist Party members. Tang Jinbao, a crane operator at the Chongqing 101 Steel Plant (state-owned), who joined the Communist Party at the end of April this year, is a Class A industrial labor model in Chongqing. This veteran worker with seventeen years of experience has trained 28 technical workers for the country in the past three years, some of whom have become Grade 6 workers. The hand-operated cranes they manufacture not only save manpower but also increase lifting efficiency by about two times. On various construction sites in Zhengzhou, Communist Party members are the creators or leaders in promoting various advanced work methods. Gan Zhirong, a Communist Party member in the steel bar workshop of the Central South Textile Administration Engineering Company, created an electric disc (thin steel bar) straightening machine through long-term research, which is sixteen times more efficient than manual labor. This year, the use of this machine in a project in Zhengzhou saved several thousand workdays (calculated as one person working one day) compared to manual labor. The construction team led by Yang Xingjia, a Communist Party member of the Henan Provincial Construction Engineering Company, was the earliest and best team in the company's carpentry division to implement Xie Wanfu's assembly line operation method. The construction team led by another Communist Party member, Zhang Shuxing, was one of the earliest and best teams in the company's masonry division to implement Su Changyou's double-hand grouting method. After Zhang Shuxing was promoted to captain of the masonry construction squad this year, the squad he led continued to maintain this honor.
    The employees who gloriously joined the Party can all play the role of the vanguard of the working class, maintain and develop their original excellent qualities, and play a leading and exemplary role among the masses, earning the love of the masses. Liu Tianlu, a worker in the foundry workshop of the Northwest Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Plant in Xi'an, simultaneously accepted two tasks in March of this year: trial-producing six-ton flatcar wheels and horse-drawn harvesters. To ensure that neither job was delayed, he insisted on working day and night. After four consecutive nights of research, he improved a piece of equipment used in the trial production of six-ton flatcar wheels, finally enabling the rapid successful trial production of the wheels. Due to his selfless labor, he has gained the respect of all workers in the factory, and he has now been promoted to foreman. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Many workers in the Hegang Mining Bureau have joined the Communist Party of China. From July 1952 to May of this year alone, nearly two thousand workers became members of the Communist Party of China. These Party members have undergone the test of various political movements and long-term education and training before joining the Party, have a relatively high level of political awareness, and have great prestige among the masses. Many Party members have been rated as labor models or received awards.
    Xue Wanjiang, a national coal mining labor model and the banner of safe production at the Hegang Mining Bureau, is a member of the Communist Party of China. He and the coal mining team he leads have never had any deaths or serious injuries since October 1950 and have completed the state plan on a monthly and quarterly basis. The experience of safe production of this team has been promoted in various mines of the Hegang Mining Bureau. Lu Wenping, a national coal mining labor model and Communist Party member, and the coal mining team he leads, have achieved great results in learning, promoting, and adhering to regular cycle operations according to instruction charts since March 1952. This team exceeded the state plan in both 1952 and 1953. Li Shuxiang, the leader of the first coal mining team in Xing’an Mine and a member of the Communist Party of China, has not been absent from work once since the liberation of Hegang in 1945. His spirit of hard work has been taken as a model by all workers. In the vertical shaft construction project, the exemplary role of Communist Party members is particularly prominent. Most Communist Party members are undertaking the most arduous engineering tasks. Liu Jingchi, the captain of the fast haulage team of the South One haulage roadway and a national coal mining labor model, came here when the Dongshan vertical shaft started construction. In the tunneling project, he created a new record of advancing two cycles in one small shift. He is a highly respected exemplary figure in the Dongshan vertical shaft engineering team.

    In Gansu Province, Linxia Prefecture, 382 outstanding farmers from the Hui, Dongxiang, Bao’an, and Salar minority nationalities have joined the Communist Party of China. These Communist Party members have played a very good role in implementing ethnic policies and carrying out various tasks. Many people have also been elected by the masses as leading cadres in local governments. For example, among the 160 Hui, Dongxiang, Bao’an, and Salar Party members in Linxia County, more than 95% have been elected by the various ethnic groups as township heads, members of township people's government, etc.
    In the mutual aid and cooperation movement, 90% of these minority Party members have participated in mutual aid organizations. Some have also been elected as leaders of mutual aid groups. In mutual aid groups with Party members, production plans and various labor systems are generally formulated. These mutual aid groups not only have good production themselves but can also drive other mutual aid groups and individual farmers to do a good job in production.
    These minority Party members, due to their active participation in learning agricultural techniques, are generally able to use various new-style walking plows and loading and unloading liberation-style waterwheels, etc. The Dongxiang Autonomous Region is prone to drought due to its high terrain. The Dongxiang Party members there have led farmers to build terraced fields, build embankments, and dig water storage ponds, playing a significant role in leading farmers to overcome drought and ensure increased grain production.

    重庆、西安等地许多优秀工人加入了共产党
    甘肃临夏专区有三百八十多少数民族优秀农民参加共产党
    重庆、西安、郑州等市已有许多优秀的工人加入了中国共产党。
    重庆市从一九五三年七月到今年五月，各厂矿企业中又有六千二百多名优秀工人加入了中国共产党；现在重庆市各厂矿企业中的共产党员已占全市职工总数的百分之九点七，全市有百分之十五点七三的工程技术人员已成为光荣的共产党员；据四十五个大型工厂的统计，全体党员中有百分之五十是有十年以上工龄的老技术工人。西安市各工厂从一九五三年“七一”以来的一年中，有八百多名优秀的职工入党。到六月二十二日为止的统计，郑州市建筑工人中的共产党员数目比一九五三年五月底增加了十三倍；去年五月底，每五百多个工人中才有一个共产党员，现在每四十个工人中就有一个党员；这些共产党员中，有百分之九十以上是具有多年生产经验的技术工人。
    这三个城市中被接收入党的职工，都是生产中或工作中的先进人物，都曾经在生产或工作中创造过一些显著的成绩。重庆市四十五个大型工厂的全体劳动模范中，有百分之三十四点四是共产党员。今年四月底加入共产党的国营重庆一零一钢铁厂起重班工人唐金宝，就是重庆市甲等工业劳动模范。这位已有十七年工龄的老工人，三年来先后为国家培养了二十八名技术工人，其中有的已成为六级工人；他们制造的手摇起重机，不仅节省了人力，还使起重效率提高了两倍左右。在郑州市的各个建筑工地上，共产党员都是各种先进工作方法的创造者或带头推行人。中南纺织管理局工程公司钢筋车间的共产党员甘志荣在长期钻研中创造出的电动圆盘（细钢筋）拉直机，比人工效率提高十六倍，今年在郑州的一个工程中使用了这种机器，就比用人工节省了几千个工日（按一人做一天工计算）。河南省建筑工程公司中共产党员杨兴家所领导的施工组，是全公司木工中推行谢万福流水作业法最早也是最好的一个组；另一个共产党员张树兴所领导的施工组，是全公司泥工中推行苏长有双手挤浆工作法最早也是最好的组之一，张树兴今年被提升为泥工施工中队队长以后，他所领导的这个中队继续保持了这种荣誉。
    光荣入党的职工们，都能发挥工人阶级先锋队的作用，保持和发扬他们原有的优秀品质，在群众中起带头和模范作用，受到群众的爱戴。西安市的西北农业机械制造厂铸工车间工人刘天禄，今年三月同时接受了试制六吨平车轮和马拉收割机的两个任务，他为了使这两种工作都不耽误，白天黑夜都坚持工作；经过连续四个晚上的钻研，改进了试制六吨平车轮时的一项设备，终于使车轮很快试制成功。由于他忘我地劳动，受到全厂工人的尊敬，现在他已被提升为工长。（新华社）
    鹤岗矿务局已有很多工人参加了中国共产党。其中仅以一九五二年七月到今年五月统计：就有将近两千个工人成了中国共产党的党员。这些党员在入党前曾经过各种政治运动的考验和长时期的教育培养，政治觉悟较高，在群众中很有威信。有很多党员都已被评为劳动模范或受到了奖励。
    全国煤矿劳动模范、鹤岗矿务局安全生产的旗帜薛万江，就是中国共产党的党员，他和他领导的采煤小组，从一九五零年十月到现在，从来没有发生过死亡和重伤事故，并且按月按季完成了国家计划。这个小组的安全生产经验已在鹤岗矿务局各矿推广。全国煤矿劳动模范、共产党员吕文平和他领导的采煤班，从一九五二年三月开始学习、推广和坚持了正规循环按指示图表作业取得了很大成绩，这个班在一九五二年和一九五三年两年中，都超额完成了国家计划。兴山矿一坑采煤组长、中国共产党员李树祥，从一九四五年鹤岗解放以来没有旷过一次工。他的艰苦精神，已被全体工人当作学习的榜样。在竖井建设工程中，共产党员的模范作用显得特别突出。大部分共产党员都是担当着最艰巨的工程任务。南一槽运输大巷的快速送道队队长、全国煤矿劳动模范刘景池，从东山竖井开工就来到这里，在掘进工程中他曾创造了一小班前进两个循环的新纪录。他是东山竖井工程队中很有威望的模范人物。　（新华社）
    甘肃省临夏专区已有三百八十二个回、东乡、保安、撒拉等少数民族的优秀农民参加了中国共产党。这些共产党员，在贯彻民族政策和开展各项工作中都起了很好作用。有许多人还被群众选为当地政权中的领导骨干。如临夏县一百六十个回、东乡、保安、撒拉族党员中，有百分之九十五以上都被各族人民选为乡长、乡人民政府委员等。
    在互助合作运动中，这些少数民族党员有百分之九十都参加了互助组织。有的还被选为互助组组长。在有党员参加的互助组里，一般都制订了生产计划和各种劳动制度。这些互助组不但自己的生产好，还能带动其他互助组和单干农民作好生产。
    这些少数民族党员，由于积极参加了学习农业技术的活动，所以一般都能使用各种新式步犁和装卸解放式水车等。东乡族自治区由于地势高，经年发生干旱，那里的东乡族党员便领导农民修梯田、筑地埂、挖涝池，在领导农民战胜旱灾、保证增产粮食方面起了很大作用。（新华社）
