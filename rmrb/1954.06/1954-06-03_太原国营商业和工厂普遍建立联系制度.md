Taiyuan city’s state-owned trading departments and state-owned light industrial departments have universally established a liaison system. This system was pioneered by Wang Jinkang, a model salesman from the Taiyuan Department Store, and Hou Xiaoxian, a labor model from the Taiyuan Paper Mill, and has been further developed and consolidated this year. Producers and sellers decided to hold regular production and sales symposiums at the beginning of each quarter, attended by leading cadres and advanced workers, to exchange consumer opinions, paper sales information, and market demand conditions. In addition, there is a regular written communication every month. After this advanced experience was promoted throughout the city, factories such as Jinsheng Textile Factory, Taiyuan Woolen Mill, Shanxi Chemical Factory, Taiyuan Chemical Factory, and Jinhua Textile Factory have now established regular production and sales meetings, written communication, and correspondence from advanced figures with the provincial and municipal department stores. In April of this year, the Provincial Department Store invited representatives from more than ten factories in Taiyuan City and representatives of trade workers from the province to hold a symposium. More than 2,000 products were also exhibited at the meeting, launching criticism and self-criticism, and putting forward opinions on improving product specifications and quality. This liaison system has had a significant effect on improving production. The glass produced by the Dalian Glass Factory had the defect of uneven thickness. The salesman, Geng Guangyin, reflected the consumers' opinions to the factory. After the factory improved according to these opinions, the product immediately changed from being unsalable to selling well. The rubber shoes produced by the Tianjin Rubber Factory had more small sizes and fewer large sizes. Because the feet of farmers are generally larger, this resulted in large sizes being out of stock and small sizes being overstocked. The Tianjin Rubber Factory improved the size of the rubber shoes according to the opinions reflected by the Taiyuan Department Store, and the farmers happily said: "The worker elder brothers are thinking of the farmers in every way!"

    太原国营商业和工厂普遍建立联系制度
    太原市国营贸易部门和国营轻工业部门间，普遍建立了联系制度。这一制度是太原市百货公司模范推销员王锦康和太原造纸厂的劳动模范侯效贤带头建立起来的，今年已有了进一步的发展和巩固。生产者和推销者确定在每季季首定期举行有领导干部和先进工作者参加的产销座谈会，交流消费者的意见、纸张推销和市场需求的情况。此外，每月并有定期的书面联系。这一先进经验在全市推广后，现已有晋生纺织厂、太原毛织厂、山西化学厂、太原化学厂、晋华纺织厂等和省、市百货公司建立了定期的产销会议、书面联系、先进人物写信等的联系制度。今年四月省百货公司邀请太原市十余个工厂的代表、全省贸易工作人员代表举行座谈会，会上还展览了二千多种产品，展开了批评与自我批评，提出了改进产品规格、质量的意见。这种联系制度对改进生产已收到显著效果。大连玻璃厂出产的玻璃存在厚薄不均的缺点，推销员耿光寅把消费者的意见反映给该厂，该厂根据这些意见作了改进后，产品立即由积压而畅销。天津橡胶厂所产的胶鞋，小号的多，大号的少，因为农民的脚一般的比较大，因此，形成了大号脱销，小号积压的现象。天津橡胶厂根据太原百货公司反映的意见改进了胶鞋的尺寸，农民高兴地说：“工人老大哥就是处处为农民打算哩！”
