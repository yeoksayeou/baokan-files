    Manufacturing More and Lighter New Farm Tools

    Outside the assembly workshop of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory in the eastern suburbs of Beijing, brand-new harvesters painted red, gray, and yellow are lined up. These harvesters are being transported to various places in batches.

    Since this spring, the workers of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory have manufactured more than 40,000 major new-style farm tools that are popular among farmers, such as 8-inch walking plows, three-tooth light weeding hoes, rocker-arm harvesters, and Bukov-style waterwheels. These farm tools have been supplied to meet the needs of farmers in a timely manner according to the production season. Now, many farmers in various places are using three-tooth light weeding hoes to cultivate the land, and some rocker-arm harvesters are speeding across the wheat fields of the Huanghuai Plain.

    This spring, all the workers of the factory made great efforts to greatly reduce the production cost of new farm tools. The selling price of each 8-inch walking plow has been reduced from 220,000 yuan in the first quarter to 165,000 yuan; the selling price of the three-tooth light weeding hoe was more than 300,000 yuan last year, and it has been reduced to more than 220,000 yuan this year; the cost of the rocker-arm harvester was more than 15 million yuan last year, and it has now been reduced to more than 7 million yuan. The workers are now continuing their efforts to reduce production costs and create conditions for more farmers to use new farm tools. Their goal is: to reduce the cost of the three-tooth light weeding hoe to more than 170,000 yuan by the second half of this year, and to reduce the cost of the rocker-arm harvester to more than 5 million yuan. That is to say, the cost of the harvester alone will be reduced by nearly two-thirds compared with last year. Double-wheel double-furrow plows will be manufactured in large quantities starting in July. Based on the research and design by the workers, before manufacturing, the cost per unit has been reduced from more than 1.3 million yuan last year to more than 900,000 yuan; after production begins, efforts will be made to reduce it to more than 700,000 yuan per unit. In this way, the cost of the double-wheel double-furrow plow will also be reduced by about 30% to 40% compared with last year. Now, farmers in various places, especially those who are organized, urgently demand the supply of high-quality and low-priced new-style farm tools to rapidly improve agricultural production. The workers of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory have made an enthusiastic response here and strongly supported them.

    The Workers in the Technical Innovation Movement

    Labor model Wang Changpei said: "If people's minds are transformed, they will work hard to transform machines." Working hard to transform "machines" (production tools), greatly saving manpower and raw materials, and ensuring that new farm tools have certain specifications are important reasons for making new farm tools more "high-quality and low-priced." After the general line propaganda and the education of the worker-peasant alliance last year and this spring, a widespread technical innovation movement was launched throughout the factory. Everyone took the initiative to find ways to solve the key problems in the manufacturing process when manufacturing any new farm tool. In production, hundreds of rationalization proposals from workers have been supported by the leadership.

    When manufacturing harvesters, the quantity to be produced was very large, but the production tools were backward and the production technology level was very low. In the past, when manufacturing ten or twenty units, without tools, they were made manually, and the cost of man-hours accounted for a large proportion of the production cost. The farm tools were good, but they were too expensive for farmers to afford. The workers had a heated discussion on improving the production of harvesters: the factory manufactured walking plows, and it took four years to greatly improve labor efficiency and greatly reduce the proportion of man-hour costs in the cost, so the cost was reduced. This year, when manufacturing harvesters, everyone firmly advocated that in the shortest possible time, man-hours should be greatly reduced and costs should be reduced. The workers put forward many rationalization proposals in this production. Many tools for manufacturing harvester parts were designed, tested, and produced at the same time. When the task of manufacturing harvesters was nearing completion, all the workers in the factory improved more than 100 tools for manufacturing harvester parts, reduced man-hours by half, reduced costs by one-third, and completed the task on time.

    The Bukov-style waterwheel was manufactured for the first time this year, and everyone had no experience. When manufacturing, if the waterwheel pipes were manufactured section by section manually, and then trimmed section by section, it would not be able to keep up with the use. Furthermore, each waterwheel has more than 400 chain links, and 2,000 waterwheels have more than 800,000 chain links. If these chain links are not checked one by one, they may be dangerous when they reach the hands of farmers; however, if they are checked one by one, one person can only check more than 1,000 a day manually. Ten people check, and it will take more than 80 days to complete the check, which costs a lot of manpower and still cannot keep up with the use. Wang Changpei then thought: "If this task is solved only by manpower, it is still the old way, and it will not be able to keep up with the time. We must think of a way on the machine." He studied and experimented with technicians and workers, and finally improved the chain link bending tool and created a machine for making waterwheel pipes, which greatly improved the quantity and quality of chain link and waterwheel pipe manufacturing. With the machine, the work of the original veteran technicians can also be replaced by young workers. Then, Feng Xiqian, head of the technical inspection section, and technical workers Chen Shuqi and Tian Jinlu cooperated to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and created an automatic inspection tool for waterwheel chain links. Each tool can check 10,000 pieces a day with electricity, which is nine times more efficient than manual labor, and it can also distinguish three different products: A, B, and repair, ensuring quality. The task of manufacturing waterwheels was therefore completed ahead of schedule.

    For the double-wheel double-furrow plow, which will be manufactured in large quantities soon, the workers have made many improvements in the design according to the opinions of the farmers. The plow column, plow handle, and traction plate of the double-furrow plow have been strengthened, the support wheel part has been simplified, and some places have used nodular cast iron instead of steel. Many tools for manufacturing double-furrow plows have also been improved. Up to now, the man-hours used for the double-wheel double-furrow plow researched and designed by the workers have been reduced by more than half compared with the past. Due to the use of substitutes, the cost of raw materials has been reduced a lot, and the quality is even higher than before. This autumn, it will be more welcomed by the majority of farmers.

    Friendship Established Between Workers and Peasants

    In the past few years, a total of more than 600,000 new-style farm tools have been promoted nationwide, of which nearly 400,000 were manufactured by the workers of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory. The use of these farm tools has significantly improved agricultural production in many areas. Therefore, the majority of farmers love the worker-elder brothers who directly serve their production even more. I saw many letters from farmers to the workers in the factory director's office, the general branch office of the Chinese Communist Party, and the trade union office of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory. These letters fully express the farmers' love for new farm tools and their gratitude to the worker-elder brothers. Before the May Day this year, Liu Qingrong, a model agricultural worker and mutual aid team member in Nanyuan District who had visited the Agricultural Machinery General Factory, called three times to send 300 catties of celery to all the workers in the factory to eat. The factory repeatedly declined, but still could not stop his enthusiasm. He finally sent a well-grown celery field to all the workers in the factory. He said: "Worker comrades work hard all day long for us. We grow vegetables for the sake of calling worker comrades to eat well. In the future, I will definitely increase production more and guarantee your needs." This noble friendship of peasant brothers is constantly encouraging workers to improve production and manufacture better farm tools for peasant brothers.

    为农民创造使用新农具的条件

    制造了更多更轻便的新农具
    在北京东郊华北农业机械总厂，装配车间的外边，摆满了涂着红色、灰色和黄色的崭新收割机。这些收割机正在一批一批地被运往各地。
    今年春天以来，华北农业机械总厂的职工们，已经制造了为农民所喜爱的八吋步犁、三齿轻便耘锄、摇臂式收割机、布可夫式水车等主要新式农具四万多部。这些农具都已按照生产季节及时供应了农民的需要。现在，各地许多农民都正用三齿轻便耘锄锄地，一部分摇臂式收割机已在黄淮平原的麦田里奔驰。
    全厂职工今春作了巨大努力，使新农具的生产成本大大降低了。八吋步犁的每部售价，已从第一季度的二十二万元降到十六万五千元；三齿轻便耘锄的售价，去年每部是三十万余元，今年已经降低到二十二万余元；摇臂式收割机，去年的成本是一千五百多万元，现在已降低到七百多万元。职工们现在正在继续努力，降低生产成本，为更多的农民创造使用新农具的条件。他们奋斗的目标是：到今年下半年，把三齿轻便耘锄的成本降低到十七万余元，把摇臂式收割机的成本降低到五百多万元，这就是说，只是收割机的成本，就要比去年降低近三分之二了。双轮双铧犁，从七月份起就要大批制造。在没有制造以前，就职工群众们已经研究设计的情况看来，每部的成本已从去年的一百三十多万元，降低到了九十多万元；开始生产以后，要争取把它降低到七十多万元一部。这样，双轮双铧犁的成本也要比去年降低百分之三十到四十左右。现在，各地农民，尤其是组织起来的农民，迫切要求供应物美价廉的新式农具，以迅速提高农业生产。华北农业机械总厂的职工们，在这里作了热诚的回答，有力地支援了他们。
    在技术革新运动中的职工们
    劳动模范王长佩说：“人的思想改造了，就会用功夫改造机器”。用功夫改造“机器”（生产工具），大量节省人力和原料，并保证新农具有一定的规格，就是使新农具更加“物美价廉”的重要原因。经过去年和今年春天的总路线宣传及工农联盟的教育，全厂广泛的技术革新运动展开了，大家在制造任何一种新农具时，都主动想法解决制造过程中的关键问题。在生产中，职工的数百件合理化建议都得到了领导上的支持。
    在制造收割机时，要生产的数量很大，但是生产工具落后，生产技术水平很低。过去制造十部、二十部，没有工具，就用人工做，每部所用工时的费用在生产成本中占了很大比例，农具好是好，就是太贵了，农民买不起。职工们对改进收割机生产的事，进行了热烈的讨论：厂里制造步犁，经过四年的工夫，才把劳动效率大大提高，使所用工时的费用在成本中的比例大大减少，所以成本降低了。今年制造收割机时，大家坚决主张，在最短时间内，大大压缩工时，降低成本。职工们在这项生产中提出了很多合理化建议，许多制造收割机零件的工具，都是边设计，边试制，边生产。到制造收割机的任务接近完成时，全厂职工改进了制造收割机零件的工具达一百多件，工时减少了一半，成本减低了三分之一，任务按时完成。
    布可夫式水车是今年初次制造，大家都没有经验。在制造时，要是用人工一截一截的制造水车管子，又一截一截的剪修，那就赶不上使用。再说，每部水车的链环就有四百多个，二千部水车有八十多万个链环，这些链环，不一个个经过检查，到了农民手里就可能发生危险；可是要一个个都检查，用人工一个人一天只能检查一千多个，十个人检查，还得八十多天才能检查完，费了很多人工，也还是赶不上用。王长佩这时就想：“这个任务要是光想用人力来解决，那还是老一套，怎么也赶不上趟，非在机器上想办法不可了。”他和技术人员、工人一起研究试验，终于改进了链环弯形工具，创造了制水车管子的机器，使制造链环、水车管子的数量和质量都大大提高；有了机器，原来老技术工人的工作，也可用青工代替了。接着技术检查科科长冯希谦和技术工人陈书奇、田金禄合作，也学习苏联先进经验，创造了水车链环的自动化检验工具，用电力每个工具一天可检查一万个，比人工效率提高九倍，而且还可分出甲、乙、退修三种不同的产品，保证了质量。制造水车的任务因此也提前完成。
    即将大批制造的双轮双铧犁，职工们已经根据农民群众的意见在设计上作了很多改进，双铧犁的犁柱、犁把和牵引板加固了，托轮部简化了，有的地方用球墨铸铁代替了钢材。许多制造双铧犁的工具也改进了。到现在为止，职工们研究设计的双轮双铧犁，所用的工时，比过去已经减少了一半多，由于采用了代用品，原料的成本降低许多，质量还比以前提高。到今年秋天，它将更加受到广大农民的欢迎。
    工农间建立了友情
    几年来全国一共推广新式农具六十余万件，其中华北农业机械总厂职工制造的，就近四十万件。这些农具的使用，在不少地区都使农业生产显著提高了。所以，广大农民更加热爱为他们的生产直接服务的工人老大哥。我在华北农业机械总厂的厂长办公室、中共总支办公室和工会办公室里，都看到了许多农民寄给职工们的信，这些信充分表现了农民对新农具的热爱，对工人老大哥的感激。今年五一节前，曾经到农业机械总厂参观过的南苑区农业劳动模范、互助组员刘庆荣，打来了三次电话，要送给全厂职工三百斤芹菜吃，工厂再三婉言谢绝，还是阻止不了他的热情。他终于把一畦长得很好的芹菜送给了全厂职工，他说：“工人同志们一天辛辛苦苦的干活，为的是我们，我们种菜就是为的叫工人同志们吃的好好的。今后我一定还要多多增产，保证你们的需要。”这种农民弟兄的崇高友情，无时不在鼓舞职工改进生产，为农民兄弟制造更好的农具。
