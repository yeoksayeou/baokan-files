Spring Cocoons from Various Parts of Southwest China Enter the Market

Spring cocoons in the Southwest region have entered the market one after another. Silkworm farmers in Leshan, Nanchong, Mianyang and other special districts of Sichuan Province and Zunyi Special District of Guizhou Province are selling large quantities of cocoons to the state. Some silk factories in Leshan and other places have already begun to use new raw materials for production.

Due to the publicity of the state's general task during the transition period, the broad masses of silkworm farmers have further realized the close relationship between silkworm raising and industrial construction. At the same time, relevant departments have correctly implemented the state's price policy, and silkworm farmers are very enthusiastic about selling cocoons this year. The Leshan office of the Southwest Silk Company has overfulfilled the plan to purchase local cocoons in a very short period of time. The quantity of local cocoons purchased in Zheng'an County, Guizhou Province, is expected to exceed the original plan by more than one time.

This year, thanks to the state's supply of high-quality silkworm eggs to silkworm farmers and the strengthening of technical guidance work by relevant technical departments in the silkworm areas, the unit yield of silkworm cocoons (per silkworm egg sheet) in various parts of Southwest China is generally three kilograms higher than last year, and the quality of the cocoons is also good.

    西南各地春茧上市
    西南区春茧已相继上市。四川省乐山、南充、绵阳等专区和贵州省遵义专区各地的蚕农，正把大批蚕茧卖给国家。乐山等地部分丝厂已经开始用新原料生产。
    由于经过国家过渡时期总任务的宣传，广大蚕农进一步认识了养蚕和工业建设的密切关系，同时有关部门正确地贯彻了国家的价格政策，今年蚕农售茧情绪很高。西南蚕丝公司乐山办事处在很短的时间内，就超额完成了收购土茧的计划。贵州省正安县收购土茧的数量，预计可超过原计划一倍多。
    今年由于国家供给了蚕农优良的蚕种，有关技术部门深入蚕区加强了技术指导工作，西南各地蚕茧单位产量（一张蚕种），一般都比去年高出三公斤，蚕茧质量也好。　（毕连阁）
