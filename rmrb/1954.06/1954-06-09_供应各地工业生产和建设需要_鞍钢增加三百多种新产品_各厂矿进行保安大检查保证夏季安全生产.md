Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 8th. Anshan Iron and Steel Company has added more than 300 new products of different varieties and specifications in the first few months of this year. These new products include various specifications of large round steel and channel steel, and seamless steel pipes of various diameters and wall thicknesses. The medium-sized rolling mill has newly produced Soviet-style fishplates. The steelmaking plant has successfully trial-produced Soviet standard welding rod steel. With the help of Soviet experts, the refractory material plant has successfully trial-produced high-quality chrome-magnesia bricks.

    In the near future, Anshan Iron and Steel workers will also produce large angle steel and I-beams, medium channel steel, and extra-large cast iron pipes with a diameter of 1,000 mm and other new products.

    The different specifications and types of seamless steel pipes have increased from dozens to hundreds, which can supply steam pipelines, geological drilling rigs and boilers of different sizes for industrial production and construction in various places. Various specifications of large-sized steel can also better suit the needs of large-scale construction such as the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. The Soviet-style fishplate is also a kind of steel urgently needed for railway construction. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and Baoji-Chengdu Railway, which are under construction, have heavy steel rails rolled by large rolling mills, but the problem is that they lack Soviet-style fishplates, making installation impossible. Therefore, after the successful trial production of this new type of fishplate by the medium-sized rolling mill, this problem can be solved. Now the medium-sized rolling mill is working hard to rush production in large quantities, and people can often see vehicles loaded with fishplates being transported to the railway construction site.

    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan. As the hot summer is approaching, the factories and mines under the Anshan Iron and Steel Company are conducting security checks to ensure safe production in the summer.

    All factories and mines have further improved their safety organizations, and have organized inspection teams according to the production system to conduct inspections in various work sections and workshops. The Cherry Orchard Iron Mine implemented the method of "inspecting and solving at the same time", and solved more than 140 safety-related issues raised by employees during the inspection process. During the inspection, all factories and mines also widely carried out production safety education to employees with examples of accidents caused by poor safety work. At the same time, they criticized the wrong thinking of some units that put production in opposition to safety work, and demanded that safety work be regarded as a regular task.

    Steelmaking plants and other units designated Monday as "Safety Activity Day." On the morning of this day, the factory director, the heads of various work sections, and Soviet experts went to the site together for inspection, and solved any problems immediately. If it could not be solved at that time, they would immediately study a solution. On "Safety Activity Day", workers had to summarize the accidents that occurred in the past week and put forward prevention methods. Important machinery such as electrical equipment in the factory were checked by someone responsible every day. When workers handed over shifts every day, they had to include the safety production situation as one of the important contents of the shift handover.

    供应各地工业生产和建设需要
    鞍钢增加三百多种新产品
    各厂矿进行保安大检查保证夏季安全生产
    【新华社鞍山八日电】鞍山钢铁公司在今年上半年的几个月内，增加了三百多种不同品种和不同规格的新产品。这些新产品包括各种不同规格的大型圆钢和槽钢，各种口径大小和管壁厚薄不同的无缝钢管。中型轧钢厂新生产了苏联式的鱼尾板。炼钢厂试制成功了苏联标准的焊条钢。耐火材料厂在苏联专家帮助下，试制成功了质量优等的铬镁砖。
    不久以后，鞍钢工人还要生产大型的角钢和工字钢，中型槽钢，还有直径一千公厘特大号的铸铁管等新产品。
    无缝钢管不同的规格和种类已经由几十种增加到几百种，这样就可以供应各地工业生产建设中装置大小不同的蒸汽管道，地质钻探机和锅炉。各种规格的大型钢材也可更适合像武汉长江大桥、第一汽车制造厂等大规模建筑的需要。苏联式的鱼尾板也是目前建筑铁路急需的一种钢材。正在建设的兰新铁路、宝成铁路等有了大型轧钢厂轧制的重型钢轨，可是缺少苏联式的鱼尾板，就无法安装。因此中型轧钢厂试制这种新式的鱼尾板成功后，这个问题就可以解决。现在中型轧钢厂已在紧张地大批赶制，人们经常可以看到满载鱼尾板的车辆运往建筑铁道的工地去。
    【新华社鞍山讯】炎夏就要到来，鞍山钢铁公司所属各厂矿正在进行保安大检查，以保证在夏季做到安全生产。
    各厂矿都进一步健全了安全组织机构，并按生产系统分别组织了检查小组，深入各工段、各车间进行检查。樱桃园铁矿实行了“边检查边解决”的办法，在检查过程中解决了职工们提出的一百四十多件关于保安的问题。各厂矿在进行检查时，还把因为安全工作做得不好而发生事故的事例，向职工们广泛地进行了生产保安教育。同时批判了有些单位把生产和安全工作对立起来的错误思想，要求把保安工作作为经常性的工作。
    炼钢厂等单位把星期一作为“安全活动日”。在这一天的早晨，厂长、各工段长和苏联专家一同到现场检查，发现问题立即解决。当时不能解决的，也要马上研究解决的办法。工人们在“安全活动日”要总结一周发生了那些事故，提出防止的办法。厂里的电气设备等重要机械，天天有人负责检查。职工们在每日交接班时，要把安全生产的情况作为交班的重要内容之一。
