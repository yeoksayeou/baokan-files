The United States is the Culprit in Breaking Up the Korean Issue Conference
Wall Street Fears Korean Peace
In the last meeting on June 15 to discuss the Korean issue, Foreign Minister Molotov said: "The Korean people are hoping that this conference will say a word for peace, a word that will make the Korean people believe that peace will be strengthened in their country." However, the US representative resolutely refused to say a word for Korean peace, and stubbornly refused to reach an agreement on any issue related to Korean peace. Due to the extreme sabotage by the United States, the meeting to discuss the Korean issue was forced to end without any agreement.

From the reports of this conference, one can see the extent to which the United States fears peace and refuses consultation! At this conference, Smith not only rejected the proposal of Foreign Minister Nam Il "on guaranteeing the state of peace in Korea," rejected Foreign Minister Molotov's "Declaration on Korea" (this declaration aims to prevent threatening actions against Korean peace), but also rejected Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal to continue efforts in the future to negotiate a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, attempting to stifle the hope of seeking a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. Even the Associated Press said: In order to save the deadlock of the conference, North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union made "one last-minute effort," but the United States continued its destructive policy to the "last minute" in order to prevent the conference from achieving any results.

It is not surprising that the US representative is unwilling to say a word for Korean peace. As early as 1951, when the US aggressors were forced to accept the Korean armistice negotiations after military defeats, the "New York Times" clamored:
	"The sudden appearance of peace will hurt (American) industry and commerce." This spring, US Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Robertson also bluntly stated: "Peace in Korea will have serious consequences for the United States. It will cause pressure for China to enter the United Nations, disintegrate the ANZUS Treaty, and lead to increased pressure in Japan demanding that the United States abandon its military bases." In a word, peace is the thing that the US rulers fear the most. The US ruling group brazenly and unscrupulously sabotages the negotiations on the Korean issue, which is precisely a manifestation of their fear of peace.

Threatening Vassal States to Sabotage the Conference
Threatening vassal states to jointly sabotage the Geneva Conference, this is the United States' policy towards this conference. Before leaving the United States for Geneva on April 20, Dulles summoned representatives of the countries that invaded Korea and representatives of the three puppet governments in Indochina to a secret meeting in Washington. After Dulles told these representatives the "most confidential" intelligence of the "strategy" adopted by the United States at the Geneva Conference, he disregarded international etiquette and demanded on the spot that these representatives swear to keep the secret, and told them that the replies to all reporters' inquiries should be limited to the press releases issued by the US State Department. This approach by the United States once made its allies "shocked" (Associated Press).

However, what shocked the United States' vassals even more was that a month earlier, the US House Foreign Affairs Committee released information saying: "Before the end of the Geneva negotiations, it does not want to make decisions on two major items (the first is on aid to Europe, and the second is on the Asian and Pacific region)." The fact is very obvious: the United States' consistent magic weapon of coercing vassal states has also been used: "If you want money, you have to sabotage the Geneva Conference!"

Before this conference, the US delegation held a series of "strategic meetings," coercing its vassal states to agree to use the so-called "Sixteen-Nation Joint Declaration" to break up the conference. And when we compare the "Sixteen-Nation Joint Declaration" with the attitudes expressed by representatives of some Western countries at the conference, we can clearly see the contradictions. For example, British representative Eden listed many common points, and he also said: "With so many common points, we should not feel disappointed about seeking a solution." However, the so-called "Sixteen-Nation Joint Declaration" insisted that "there is actually no agreement" and that "continuing to consider and study the Korean issue would be of no use." This shows that the so-called "Sixteen-Nation Joint Declaration" does not reflect the common views of the sixteen countries.

The hope of resolving the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference was strangled alive. The US aggressors are the heinous culprits who strangled this hope. What is even more heinous is that the US aggressors also coerced other vassal states to jointly bear the responsibility for sabotaging a peaceful solution to the Korean issue.

"The United Nations' Goal in Korea"
The United States and its vassals, in the so-called "Sixteen-Nation Joint Declaration," reiterated their intention to "continue to support the United Nations' goal in Korea." What is this "goal"?

Let's take a look at some of the recent developments surrounding the Korean issue:

Agence France-Presse Washington, June 15th: "Qualified American sources" in Washington said, "They expect that after the interruption of the Geneva Conference on the Korean issue, the United States will help South Korea build itself into one of the anti-communist fortresses in the Far East. It is reported that the Pentagon favors quickly increasing the number of South Korean divisions from twenty to thirty-five. … It is said that the State Department has agreed in principle to greatly increase South Korea's military strength."

June 15th - the same day that the United States broke up the Korean issue conference, representatives of the US puppets in the Far East, such as Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, Bao Dai, and Magsaysay, began holding an "anti-communist conference" in Jinhae, South Korea, to organize an Asian puppet military alliance according to US intentions.

Reuters Geneva, June 16th: Syngman Rhee's representative, Byun Young-tae, clamored after the United States broke up the Korean issue conference that "South Korea no longer considers itself obliged to abide by the Korean Armistice Agreement" and that "what is needed is action."

Recently, the "Washington Post" published "inside information" stating that the US warmonger Van Fleet, while discussing the situation in Southeast Asia in Washington, suggested "resuming the Korean War."

…………

The above examples can serve as an annotation to "The United Nations' Goal in Korea." However, people know that this "United Nations' goal in Korea" pursued by the United States was destroyed and punctured in the Korean War. Can it still be picked up again?

### 美国是破裂朝鲜问题会议的罪魁

    美国是破裂朝鲜问题会议的罪魁
    华尔街害怕朝鲜和平
    在六月十五日讨论朝鲜问题的最后一次会议上，莫洛托夫外长说：“朝鲜人民都在希望这个会议为和平说一句话，说一句会使朝鲜人民相信和平将在他们国内加强的话。”然而，美国代表却坚决不愿意为朝鲜和平说一句话，它顽固地拒绝在任何有关朝鲜和平的问题上取得协议。由于美国的极力破坏，讨论朝鲜问题的会议就在没有得到任何协议的情况下被迫结束了。
    人们从这次会议的报道中，可以看出美国害怕和平、拒绝协商到了何等的地步！在这次会议上，史密斯不仅拒绝了南日外务相提出的“关于保证朝鲜的和平状态”的建议，拒绝了莫洛托夫外长提出的“关于朝鲜的宣言”（这个宣言目的在于防止对朝鲜和平的威胁行动），而且拒绝了周恩来外长提出的今后继续为协商和平解决朝鲜问题而努力的建议，企图以此来扼杀寻求和平解决朝鲜问题的希望。甚至合众社也说：为了挽救会议的僵局，朝、中、苏三国又“作了一次最后一分钟的努力”，然而美国为了使会议得不到任何成就，却把它的破坏政策一直继续到“最后一分钟”。
    美国代表不愿为朝鲜和平说一句话是不足奇怪的。早在一九五一年美国侵略者在军事失败以后被迫接受朝鲜停战谈判时，“纽约时报”就叫嚷过：
  “突然出现的和平将会伤害（美国的）工商业”。今年春天美国远东事务助理国务卿罗伯逊也露骨地说：“在朝鲜的和平，将对美国有严重的后果，它将引起使中国进入联合国的压力，瓦解美澳新公约，并将导致在日本要求美国放弃其军事基地的压力的增加。”一句话，和平是美国统治者最害怕的东西。美国统治集团悍然不顾一切地破坏朝鲜问题的谈判，正是他们畏惧和平的表现。
    威胁仆从国家破坏会议
    威胁仆从国家一起破坏日内瓦会议，这就是美国对这个会议的政策。杜勒斯四月二十日在离开美国前往日内瓦之前，曾召集了侵朝国家的代表和印度支那三个傀儡政府的代表在华盛顿开了一次秘密会议。杜勒斯在这个会议上把美国在日内瓦会议上所采取的“战略”的“最机密”情报告诉了这些代表们之后，竟不顾国际礼貌，当场就要这些代表宣誓保守秘密，并且对他们说对所有记者询问的答复应以美国国务院发表的公报为限。美国的这种做法当时曾使他的盟友们“感到震惊”（合众社）。
    然而更使美国的仆从们震惊的，是在一个月以前，美国众议院外交委员会放出空气说：“在日内瓦谈判结束之前，不想在两大项目（第一项是关于援助欧洲的，第二项是关于亚洲和太平洋区域的）上作出决定。”事实十分明显：美国胁迫仆从国家的
  一贯法宝也使出来了：“要钱，就得破坏日内瓦会议！”
    在这次会议以前，美国代表团召开了一连串的
  “战略会议”，胁迫它的仆从国家同意用所谓“十六国共同宣言”来破裂会议。而我们拿“十六国共同宣言”和某些西方国家代表在会议上表示的态度对照，就显然可以看出其中的矛盾。比如，英国代表艾登，就曾列举过许多共同之点，同时他还表示：
  “我们有了这么多共同的地方，我们不应该对求得解决感觉失望。”可是所谓“十六国共同宣言”却硬说“实际上却没有协议”，“继续考虑和研究朝鲜问题是不会有什么用处的”。这说明所谓“十六国共同宣言”并没有反映十六个国家共同的看法。
    在日内瓦会议上解决朝鲜问题的希望活生生地被绞杀了，美国侵略者就是绞杀这一希望的万恶的主凶，更万恶的是，美国侵略者还威迫其他仆从国家来共同担负破坏和平解决朝鲜问题的责任。
    “联合国在朝鲜的目标”
    美国和它的仆从们在所谓“十六国共同宣言”中，重申要“继续支持联合国在朝鲜的目标”。这个“目标”是什么呢？
    且来看看最近围绕着朝鲜问题所发生的一些情况吧：
    法新社华盛顿六月十五日电讯透露：华盛顿
  “有资格的美国人士”说，“他们预料在讨论朝鲜问题的日内瓦会议中断后，美国将帮助南朝鲜把自己建立成为远东的反共堡垒之一。据悉五角大楼赞成尽速把南朝鲜师由二十个增加到三十五个。……据说国务院原则上已同意大大增加南朝鲜的军事力量。”
    六月十五日——美国破裂朝鲜问题会议的同
  一天，美国在远东的傀儡李承晚、蒋介石、保大和麦格赛赛之流的代表，在南朝鲜镇海地方开始举行“反共会议”，按照美国意图，组织亚洲傀儡军事同盟。
    路透社日内瓦六月十六日电讯报道：李承晚的代表卞荣泰在美国破裂朝鲜问题会议以后，叫嚣“南朝鲜不再认为它有义务遵守朝鲜停战协定”，“需要的是行动”。
    最近“华盛顿邮报”刊载的“内幕消息”中说，美国好战分子范佛里特在华盛顿讨论东南亚局势时，曾建议“恢复朝鲜战争”。
    …………
    以上这些例子，可以作为“联合国在朝鲜的目标”的注解。然而，人们知道美国所追求的这个
  “联合国在朝鲜的目标”，在朝鲜战争中被击毁和戳破了，难道还能重新拾得起来吗？
