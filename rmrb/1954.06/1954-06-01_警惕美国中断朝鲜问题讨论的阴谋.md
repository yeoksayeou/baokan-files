Beware of the American Conspiracy to Interrupt Discussions on the Korean Issue
Wu Quan

The Geneva Conference's discussions on the Korean issue are deadlocked because the representatives of the United States and South Korea insist on unreasonable demands. American news agencies admit that the American ruling clique, disregarding the sincere efforts of the delegation representing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, and disregarding the peaceful aspirations of peace-loving people around the world, is attempting to use the absurd proposals put forward by the South Korean representative to obstruct or even interrupt the discussion of the Korean issue. Smith's speech, the American representative, at the meeting on May 28 fully demonstrated this obvious conspiracy of the United States.

In his speech at the Geneva Conference on May 28, the American representative Smith repeated the platitudes of the United States, insisting on imposing on the Korean people the illegal resolutions of the United Nations on the Korean issue, which was a belligerent party in Korea. He did not mention the substantive issue of unifying Korea on a democratic basis, but only supported the so-called "Fourteen-Point Plan" put forward by the South Korean representative, which aimed at obstructing the Geneva Conference from continuing to discuss the Korean issue. Smith's unreasonable attitude, which violated the principle of consultation, once again proved that the American delegation was deliberately unwilling to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

In the more than a month since the Geneva Conference, twelve meetings have been held on the Korean issue. The sincere efforts of the delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union to seek agreement are in stark contrast to the positions and attitudes of the United States and its followers. On April 27, Foreign Minister Nam Il suggested establishing an all-Korean committee to be responsible for preparing free all-Korean elections, with all foreign troops withdrawing from Korea on a regular basis before the all-Korean elections, and the peace development of Korea being guaranteed by the countries most concerned about peace in the Far East. The fairness and rationality of this proposal is indisputable. On May 22, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai made a supplementary proposal to Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal, advocating the establishment of a neutral nations supervisory commission to assist and supervise the holding of all-Korean elections. Fair-minded public opinion expressed support for these proposals and considered that they should be used as the basis for the conference's discussions. Even some representatives of American allies had stated that the election in Korea could be supervised by neutral countries that did not participate in the Korean War. This shows how clear the spirit of consultation and the attitude of seeking to solve problems of Korea, China and the Soviet Union are. It was this spirit and attitude that ignited people's hope for the Geneva Conference. However, the American ruling clique feared that people would have any hope for the conference. The American representative and the South Korean representative simply rejected the proposals of China and Korea, clung to the resolution illegally passed by the United Nations General Assembly on October 7, 1950 under the manipulation of the United States, insisted that the United Nations forces, mainly the American army, continue to stay in Korea, and that the United Nations, as a belligerent party, supervise the all-Korean elections. It is easy to see that these unreasonable demands completely obliterate the national rights of the Korean people, disregard the legitimate principle of Koreans solving their own problems, and attempt to extend the reactionary rule of the Syngman Rhee group to North Korea, so that the whole of Korea will become a colony of the United States, in order to achieve the goal of enslaving the whole of Korea that the United States could not achieve with three years of aggressive war. What else can it explain other than the fact that the American delegation insists on such an absurd and arrogant position that it is determined to continue to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in order to maintain the tense situation in Korea?

The American delegation insisted that the United Nations supervise the all-Korean elections, but people know that, due to American manipulation, the United Nations has become a belligerent party in Korea. The United States once used the banner of the United Nations to carry out the war of aggression against Korea, and signed the Korean Armistice Agreement in the name of the United Nations. The illegal resolutions of the United Nations on the Korean issue, which allow the United States to interfere in the internal affairs of Korea in the name of the United Nations and obstruct the Korean people from solving their own problems, also fundamentally violate the principles of the United Nations Charter. Therefore, the United Nations has lost its qualifications and moral strength to deal fairly with the Korean issue. Although Smith used the entire length of his speech to defend the "authority and moral strength" of the United Nations, he could not deny the belligerent status of the United Nations in Korea. Therefore, Smith's tone of posing as the maintainer of the United Nations organization is particularly hypocritical and shameful. To truly maintain the authority and moral strength of the United Nations, it must be extricated from the unjust position arranged for it by the United States, and not further serve the American conspiracy to occupy the entire Korea. This is a very clear principle.

However, Smith even described Byun Young-tae's so-called fourteen-point "suggestions" as an "important and meaningful action" that embodies the "important principles" of the United Nations, to cover up their unreasonable position, which is very shameful. Byun Young-tae has been shamelessly demanding at the Geneva Conference that the United States continue to interfere in Korea's internal affairs, fearing that he would lose the support of the American bayonets for the Syngman Rhee regime; he even demanded that the Chinese People's Volunteers withdraw from Korea, while the American troops should be stationed in Korea for a long time. Byun Young-tae's so-called fourteen-point "suggestions" are completely a plan to sell out the interests of the Korean nation by placing the entire Korea under American rule. This ugly act of this American puppet regime, which is despised by the world, has become the "important principle" of the United Nations that the United States is trying its best to maintain. Then, it is clear what the so-called United Nations and its "principles" in the mouths of the likes of Smith are.

Contrary to the stubborn attitude of the United States, Zhou Enlai, the Chief Representative of the People's Republic of China, suggested that in order to assist the all-Korean committee in holding all-Korean elections, a neutral nations supervisory commission should be established to supervise the elections in Korea. This suggestion not only conforms to the solemn principle of non-interference by external forces in Korea's internal affairs, but also takes into account the special circumstances existing in North and South Korea. The rationality of this proposal is beyond doubt. The United States has no reason to oppose this proposal, so they have tried their best to attack the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission that supervises the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and attempted to abolish this institution. People know that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which supervises the armistice in Korea, has done a lot of beneficial work, and the reason why it has not been able to fully exercise its functions in the area of the United Nations forces is due to the unreasonable obstruction and restrictions by the American side. Therefore, the American side should bear all the responsibilities. Now, the United States is attacking and attempting to abolish this institution, obviously with ulterior motives. On the one hand, the American warmongers hope to abolish this institution so that they can freely violate the Korean Armistice Agreement and transport a large number of reinforcement combat materials; on the other hand, the United States intends to use this to oppose the establishment of a neutral nations supervisory commission to assist the all-Korean elections and supervise the Indochina armistice, obstructing the Geneva Conference's negotiations on the Korean issue and the Indochina issue, so that it cannot reach an agreement.

The American delegation's practice of obstructing the resolution of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference is completely in line with the plan that it colluded with the Syngman Rhee group in advance. The US-ROK "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed in August 1953 stipulates that the United States will station troops in South Korea indefinitely, which shows that the United States has no intention of withdrawing troops from South Korea and no intention of ending its aggressive act of using force to interfere in Korea's internal affairs. On March 9 this year, the U.S. State Department openly stated that if the United States and the Syngman Rhee group could not achieve their predetermined "goals" at the meeting to discuss the Korean issue, they would periodically withdraw from the meeting. Now, the United States is actually "ready to end the discussion of the Korean issue at any time" (Associated Press, May 24 news). American government diplomatic officials and military leaders Dean, Wilson, Van Fleet and others have repeatedly gone to South Korea to conduct conspiracy activities, also to cooperate with the Syngman Rhee group to undermine the Geneva Conference. Spokesmen for the Syngman Rhee group have already shouted that "the Geneva talks are a waste of time" and "only force can reunify Korea." It can be seen that the arrogant and unreasonable attitude adopted by the representatives of the United States and the Syngman Rhee government at the Geneva Conference, which lacks sincerity, has been premeditated for a long time. Dulles's remarks at a press conference on May 25 openly stated that he not only wanted to step up the piecing together of the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, but also intended to once again use the United Nations, this institution, to realize the conspiracy to "internationalize" the Indochina war, and once again create a second Korean war in Indochina under the banner of the United Nations.

The American ruling clique is doing its best to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the Indochina issue, apparently because they fear that the international tension will be further eased. The American monopoly capitalist groups are trying to continue to seek bloody profits from war and war preparations, and to find a way out for the increasingly approaching economic crisis in the United States by unlimited arms expansion and war preparations. On May 15, the American "Business Week" reported that the U.S. government authorities are planning to increase military spending, and it pointed out: "Washington people are deeply convinced that more funds will be used to strengthen national defense." In order to satisfy the insatiable desires of the monopoly capitalist groups, the American government is doing its best to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the Indochina issue, and to maintain international tension. However, this can only make the American government run counter to all the people in the world who are willing to resolve the Korean and Indochina issues and ease international tensions, and thus become more isolated.

Now, the people of the world must closely watch the American conspiracy to obstruct and undermine the Geneva Conference, and do their best to stop it. All peace-loving forces have always proven to have a significant influence, and it is possible to strive for the success of the Geneva Conference.

    警惕美国中断朝鲜问题讨论的阴谋
    吴全
    日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论，由于美国和南朝鲜的代表坚持无理主张，正陷于僵持之中。美国通讯社承认，美国统治集团不顾朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中国和苏联三国代表团的真诚努力，不顾全世界爱好和平人民的和平愿望，企图利用南朝鲜代表提出的荒谬建议，来阻挠甚至中断朝鲜问题的讨论。在五月二十八日的会议上，美国代表史密斯的发言，就充分地表明了美国的这个明显的阴谋。
    美国代表史密斯在五月二十八日日内瓦会议上的发言，重复了美国的滥调，坚持要把作为朝鲜交战一方的联合国关于朝鲜问题的非法决议强加在朝鲜人民身上。他只字不提在民主基础上统一朝鲜的实质问题，只是支持南朝鲜代表提出的目的在于阻挠日内瓦会议继续讨论朝鲜问题的所谓“十四点方案”。史密斯采取的这种违反协商原则的无理态度，再一次证明美国代表团蓄意不肯和平解决朝鲜问题。
    在一个多月以来的日内瓦会议上，关于朝鲜问题的讨论已举行了十二次会议。朝、中、苏三国代表团为谋求协议所作的真诚努力，与美国及其追随者的立场和态度形成了强烈的对照。四月二十七日南日外务相建议成立全朝鲜委员会来负责准备全朝鲜的自由选举，在全朝鲜选举前一切外国军队定期撤出朝鲜，并由最关心远东和平的国家保障朝鲜的和平发展。这个建议的公平合理是无可争辩的。五月二十二日周恩来外长对南日外务相的建议提出补充建议，主张成立中立国监察委员会来协助和监察举行全朝鲜选举。公正舆论对这些建议表示支持，并认为应该把它作为会议讨论的基础。甚至有些美国盟国的代表们也曾表示，朝鲜的选举可以由没有参加朝鲜战争的中立国家来进行监督。由此可见，朝、中、苏三国的协商精神与谋求解决问题的态度是如何的鲜明。正是这种精神和态度燃起了人民对于日内瓦会议的希望。但是，美国统治集团却唯恐人民对会议抱有任何希望。美国代表和南朝鲜代表对朝中两国建议一味加以拒绝，死死抱住一九五○年十月七日联合国大会在美国操纵下非法通过的决议，主张联合国军主要是美军继续留在朝鲜，并由身为交战一方的联合国来监督全朝鲜的选举。一眼就能看穿，这些无理主张完全抹煞朝鲜人民的民族权利，无视朝鲜人自己解决自己的问题的正当原则，妄图把李承晚集团的反动统治扩展到北朝鲜去，使全朝鲜沦为美国的殖民地，以图达到美国用三年的侵略战争所不能达到的奴役全朝鲜的目的。美国代表团坚持这样荒谬而又狂妄的立场，除了说明它一心要继续阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，以保持朝鲜的紧张局势以外，还能说明什么呢？
    美国代表团坚持由联合国监督全朝鲜的选举，但是，人们知道，由于美国的操纵，联合国已成为朝鲜交战的一方。美国曾经利用联合国的旗帜进行侵略朝鲜的战争，并以联合国的名义签订了朝鲜停战协定。联合国关于朝鲜问题的非法决议，允许美国以联合国的名义来干涉朝鲜内政，阻挠朝鲜人民自己解决自己的问题，也是根本违反联合国宪章的原则的。因此，联合国已经失去了它公平处理朝鲜问题的资格和道义力量。史密斯在他的发言中尽管用了全部篇幅来为联合国的“权威和道义力量”辩护，但是他也无法否认联合国在朝鲜所处的交战一方的地位。因而，史密斯以联合国组织的维护者自居的口吻，就特别显得伪善和可耻。真正要维护联合国的权威和道义力量，就必须使联合国脱出美国为它所安置的不义的地位，而绝不是使它更进一步为美国侵占全部朝鲜的阴谋服务，这是很明白的道理。
    但是，史密斯竟然还把卞荣泰的所谓十四点“建议”说成是体现了联合国“重要原则”的“重要的和有意义的行动”，来掩饰他们的无理立场，这是非常可耻的。卞荣泰在日内瓦会议上一直毫不知耻地要求美国对朝鲜内政继续进行干涉，唯恐失去美国刺刀对李承晚政权的支持；他甚至要求中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜，而要美军长期驻在朝鲜。卞荣泰的所谓十四点“建议”，就完全是要把全朝鲜置于美国统治之下的出卖朝鲜民族利益的方案。这个为世人所不齿的美国傀儡政权的这种丑恶行径，竟然成为美国所极力维护的联合国的“重要原则”，那末，史密斯之流的口中所谓联合国和它的“原则”究竟是些什么东西，已是不问可知了。
    与美国的顽固态度相反，中华人民共和国首席代表周恩来外长建议，为了协助全朝鲜委员会举行全朝鲜选举，成立中立国监察委员会来监察朝鲜的选举，这个建议不仅符合于外力不干涉朝鲜内政的庄严原则，而且照顾了南北朝鲜现存的特殊情况。这个建议的合理性是无庸置疑的。美国没有理由反对这个建议，于是他们就竭力攻击监察朝鲜停战协定实施的中立国监察委员会，并企图取消这个机构。人们知道，在朝鲜监督停战的中立国监察委员会曾做了许多有益的工作，而它所以在联合国军地区没有能够完全行使职权，乃是由于美方无理阻挠和限制，因此全部责任应由美方承当。现在，美国攻击并企图取消这个机构，显然是怀着不可告人的用心的。一方面，美国好战分子希望取消这个机构，以便他们放手来违反朝鲜停战协定，大量运入增援性作战物资；另一方面美国希图借此来反对成立中立国监察委员会以协助全朝鲜的选举和监督印度支那停战，阻挠日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题和印度支那问题的谈判，使它不能达成协议。
    美国代表团在日内瓦会议上阻挠解决朝鲜问题的做法，完全是和它勾结李承晚集团预先布置的计划相吻合的。一九五三年八月签订的美李“共同防御条约”，规定美国将无限期驻兵南朝鲜，这就表明了美国无意从南朝鲜撤兵，无意结束它用武力干涉朝鲜内政的侵略行为。今年三月九日美国国务院公然声明，美国和李承晚集团在讨论朝鲜问题的会议上如果不能达到他们的预定“目标”，就要定期退出会议。现在，美国就居然“随时都在准备结束讨论朝鲜问题”（美联社五月二十四日消息）。美国政府外交官员和军事首脑迪安、威尔逊、范佛里特等人接连到南朝鲜进行阴谋活动，也是为了和李承晚集团相配合去破坏日内瓦会议。李承晚集团的发言人已经在那里大叫“日内瓦谈判是浪费时间”，“只有武力才能重新统一朝鲜”。由此可见，美国和李承晚政府代表在日内瓦会议上所采取的毫无诚意的狂妄无理的态度是蓄谋已久的了。杜勒斯五月二十五日在记者招待会上的谈话，还公开表明他不仅要加紧拼凑东南亚侵略集团，而且还打算再度利用联合国这个机构来实现使印度支那战争“国际化”的阴谋，再一次打着联合国的旗帜在印度支那制造第二个朝鲜战争。
    美国统治集团所以竭力阻挠朝鲜问题和印度支那问题的和平解决，显然是因为他们唯恐国际紧张局势获得进一步的缓和。美国垄断资本集团正在企图继续从战争和战争准备中谋取血腥的利润，靠无限制的扩军备战来为美国日益迫近的经济危机找寻出路。五月十五日美国“商业周刊”报道说，美政府当局正在计划增加军费，它指出：“华盛顿人士深信一定会用更多的经费来加强国防”。美国政府为了满足垄断资本集团的贪得无餍的欲望，竭力阻挠朝鲜问题和印度支那问题的和平解决，维持国际紧张局势。然而，这只能使美国政府和一切愿意解决朝鲜和印度支那问题与缓和国际紧张局势的世界人民背道而驰，因而愈加孤立起来。
    现在，全世界人民必须密切注视美国阻挠和破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋活动，并全力加以阻止。一切维护和平的力量始终证明是有重大影响的，它有可能来争取日内瓦会议获得成就。
