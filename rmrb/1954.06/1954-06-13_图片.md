    The original mechanical equipment of the coal washing workshop of the coking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant was old and could not remove the metal iron mixed in the coal, so production equipment accidents occurred frequently. Cheng Genxiong, a model worker of the coking department, and everyone worked together to create a "coal-iron separator" so that the metal iron mixed in the coal would automatically separate from the coal when it passed through the "coal-iron separator." This eliminated the occurrence of coal washing machine accidents and ensured the balanced production of the coking department. The picture shows Cheng Genxiong (left) and workers jointly inspecting the "coal-iron separator." Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Jie photographed.

    太原钢铁厂炼焦部洗煤车间原来的机械设备都是陈旧的，无法清除煤里混杂的金属铁质，因此，生产设备事故经常发生。炼焦部劳动模范成根雄和大家共同研究，创造了“煤铁分离器”，使煤里混杂的金属铁质，经过“煤铁分离器”时就自动和煤分开。这样就杜绝了洗煤机事故的发生，保证了炼焦部的均衡生产。图是成根雄（左）和工人共同检查“煤铁分离器”。　新华社记者　张杰摄
