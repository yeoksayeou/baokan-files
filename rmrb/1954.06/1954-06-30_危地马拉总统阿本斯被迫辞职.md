Xinhua News Agency, June 29th: TASS, New York, June 28th: American newspapers report that Arbenz has been forced to resign by senior Guatemalan army officers, including Colonel Diaz.

    A dispatch from Tegucigalpa (Honduras) states that army leaders held a day-long meeting before Arbenz was forced to resign. After the meeting, Diaz and two other colonels visited the president and demanded his resignation. It is said that Arbenz was very angry when he heard their decision, but finally agreed.

    It should be pointed out that shortly before Guatemala was invaded, news circulated that the army had given Arbenz 24 hours to resign.

    News from Guatemala City also indicates that when Arbenz announced his resignation on the radio, he once again stated that the invasion was launched by the United Fruit Company and other American monopoly capitalists who have investments in Latin America.

    危地马拉总统阿本斯被迫辞职
   【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社纽约二十八日讯：美国报纸消息说明：阿本斯已被迪亚斯上校等危地马拉陆军高级军官强迫辞职。
    特古西哥尔波（洪都拉斯）的消息说，在阿本斯被迫辞职以前，陆军领袖们举行了一整天的会议。在会议结束以后，迪亚斯和另外两位上校访问了总统，要求他辞职。据说阿本斯听到他们的决定时很是气愤，但是最后还是同意了这个决定。
    应该指出：在危地马拉受到侵略前不久，便流传着这个消息：陆军限阿本斯在二十四小时以内辞职。
    危地马拉城的消息也表明，阿本斯在电台宣布辞职时，再一次说明这次侵略是联合果品公司及其他在拉丁美洲有投资的美国垄断资本所发动的。
