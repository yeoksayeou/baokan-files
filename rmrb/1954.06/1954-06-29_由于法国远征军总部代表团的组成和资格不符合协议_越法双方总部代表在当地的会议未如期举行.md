    Due to the Composition and Qualifications of the French Expeditionary Force Headquarters Delegation Not Meeting the Agreement
    The Meeting of Representatives of the Vietnamese and French Headquarters in the Area Was Not Held as Scheduled
    [Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 28th] According to the Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, June 28th: Because the composition and qualifications of the delegation from the General Headquarters of the French Expeditionary Force in Indochina did not conform to the decisions of the Geneva Conference and the agreement between the two General Headquarters, the military meeting between the delegations of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army and the French Expeditionary Force was unable to commence on June 28th in the Ni (also known as Zhongyi) area south of Thai Nguyen City, as previously decided.
    It is known that, in order to implement the decisions of the Geneva Conference, the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army and the General Headquarters of the French Expeditionary Force had reached an agreement: to send delegations to meet in the Ni area south of Thai Nguyen City on the morning of June 28th. The delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army, led by Brigadier General Van Tien Dung, had already departed. On June 27th, the liaison officer of the General Headquarters of the French Expeditionary Force handed over a list of the French delegation to the liaison officer of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army. Because the composition and qualifications of the French delegation did not conform to the decisions of the Geneva Conference and the agreement between the two General Headquarters, the delegations of the two General Headquarters were unable to begin the military meeting on the previously decided date.
    On June 28th, the liaison officer of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army met with the liaison officer of the General Headquarters of the French Expeditionary Force to further discuss the composition and qualifications of the French delegation, so that the military meeting of the representatives of the two General Headquarters could be held as soon as possible.

    由于法国远征军总部代表团的组成和资格不符合协议
    越法双方总部代表在当地的会议未如期举行
    【新华社二十八日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十八日讯：由于印度支那法国远征军总司令部代表团的组成和资格不符合日内瓦会议的决定和双方总司令部的协议，越南人民军和法国远征军双方总司令部的代表团之间的军事会议，没有能够像以前所决定的那样于六月二十八日在太原城以南的尼（也称中亦）地区开始举行。
    大家知道，为执行日内瓦会议的决定，越南人民军总司令部和法国远征军总司令部曾取得协议：派遣代表团在六月二十八日早晨在太原城以南的尼地区会见。越南人民军总司令部代表团已由文进勇准将率领前往。六月二十七日，法国远征军总司令部的联络官把法国代表团的名单一份交给越南人民军总司令部联络官。由于法国代表团的组成和资格不符合日内瓦会议的决定以及双方总司令部的协议，双方总司令部的代表团没有能够在以前所决定的日期开始举行军事会议。
    六月二十八日，越南人民军总司令部的联络官会见了法国远征军总司令部联络官，进一步讨论法国代表团的组成和资格，使双方总司令部代表的军事会议能尽速举行。
