Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates:

In the course of the discussion on the Korean question, two different attitudes have been shown towards the task of realizing the national unification of Korea and establishing a single, independent and democratic state by peaceful means.

On the one hand, at the beginning of the Geneva Conference on April 27th, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward specific proposals "on restoring the national unification of Korea and holding free all-Korean elections." These proposals stipulate that elections should be held throughout Korea on the basis of agreements between North and South Korea, in a free atmosphere excluding foreign interference and pressure on voters by local authorities and terrorist groups. Therefore, our delegation proceeded from the necessity of guaranteeing the national interests of the Korean people and took into account the current practical situation in Korea.

On the other hand, the South Korean delegation put forward its proposals on May 22nd. These proposals stipulate that elections should be held in South Korea, which is still occupied by foreign troops, on the basis of subordinating North Korea to the South Korean regime, which was established with the help of these foreign troops. Those who put forward this proposal are not willing to calmly consider the actual situation existing in the two parts of Korea. The fact that the South Korean delegation did not put forward its proposal until nearly a month after the start of the Geneva Conference proves that the South Korean authorities are not interested in realistically discussing a peaceful resolution of the Korean question.

The South Korean delegation clings to a vicious idea, the basis of which is the conspiracy of the United States and the countries that follow it to force the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to submit to the Syngman Rhee regime. This can be easily seen by examining the proposals put forward by the South Korean representative.

The South Korean proposals completely ignore one of the most important issues, which is to establish an all-Korean body to prepare for and hold elections, and to resolve the issue of restoring cultural and economic relations between the two parts of Korea. It is clear that without establishing such an all-Korean body, there can be no progress in reaching mutually acceptable agreements between the two parts of Korea.

Since there are actually two governments in Korea, each with its own legislative body, it is impossible to resolve any of the above issues according to laws or decisions that are only valid in one part of Korea. However, the South Korean representative suggested that the election of an all-Korean National Assembly should not be held according to an election law formulated by an all-Korean body and acceptable to both parties, but according to the so-called "constitutional procedures" of South Korea.

The South Korean representative and certain other delegations, opposing the establishment of an all-Korean body, have cited untenable arguments here, saying that such a body would replace government institutions and force them to accept unacceptable, unilateral decisions. This possibility is absolutely non-existent, first of all, because according to the regulations, this body is composed of both parties, and all its decisions are not made according to the will of one party or the other, but through mutual agreement between the two parties that make up the body. In order to obstruct reaching an agreement on the issue of an all-Korean body, some representatives constantly hinted that it is necessary to adopt the principle of proportional representation when establishing this body, that is to say, the number of representatives of each party participating in the body should be proportional to its population, and therefore, decisions in that body should be passed by majority vote. In order to illustrate the unreasonableness of this position, in addition to the various reasons we have put forward before, we can also remind these representatives of some historical examples, from which we can see that as a step for a country to move from division to unification—that is, similar to the current situation in Korea—the establishment of a legislative body did not consider the above-mentioned principle necessary at all. We can especially remind the American representative with examples from American history. As everyone knows, at the end of the eighteenth century, the congress of representatives of the states that participated in the then-forming American Federation was declared the central authority of the federation, and each state had equal rights when resolving any issue in the congress. At that time, the population of each state was far from equal. For example, in 1790, Virginia had 747,000 residents, Pennsylvania had 434,000 people, and Delaware had only 59,000 people. But this did not prevent representatives of the above-mentioned states from participating in the congress with equal rights.

There are other similar historical examples. For example, in Switzerland, the states that participated in the unified country also formed a parliament on the basis of equal representation of each state in 1815 as the central authority, even though the population of these states varied greatly. For example, the population of the Canton of Bern was about 23 times that of the Canton of Zug, and about 30 times that of the Canton of Uri.

These historical facts are enough to show that the arguments of those who oppose the establishment of an all-Korean body are untenable.

Instead of helping the conference find a way to reconcile North and South Korea and reach mutually acceptable agreements on contentious issues of vital importance to the Korean people, some representatives continue to distort the substance of our proposals, insisting that this proposal would allow one party in the all-Korean body to impose its will on the other. However, as we have repeatedly stated, our proposal is that neither party can impose its will on the other, and decisions can only be made through agreement between the two parties in the all-Korean body. But some representatives seem to dislike this, because they are advocating here that the Syngman Rhee regime should be given the right to unilaterally decide on issues that should be agreed upon by North and South Korea. The South Korean representative suggested that the task of supervising the elections should not be carried out by a committee composed of representatives from neutral countries, as proposed by the delegation of the People's Republic of China and supported by us, but by the United Nations. However, everyone knows that the United Nations is a belligerent party and therefore cannot, of course, play the role of an objective institution on the Korean question, especially in the matter of all-Korean elections. In other words, the South Korean representative opposes allowing a truly impartial international body composed of representatives from countries that did not participate in the intervention in Korea to supervise the elections. Needless to say, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea cannot agree to the proposal of the United Nations supervising the all-Korean elections. There is no doubt that only a neutral nations commission can ensure fair supervision of the Korean elections.

The South Korean representative proposed that American troops continue to be stationed in Korea, but at the same time proposed the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. This proposal clearly shows that the South Korean regime is afraid to face the Korean people and expresses its desire to rely on the bayonets of foreign troops in implementing its anti-people policies. The essence of this proposal by the South Korean representative is to attempt to place the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in an unequal position and to create conditions that may once again subordinate North Korea to the South Korean regime. In our previous speeches, we have stated that such a proposal is untenable and unacceptable.

In order for the elections to be truly free and for the voters in South Korea to freely express their will, American troops must withdraw from South Korea at the same time as the Chinese People's Volunteer Army withdraws from North Korea. The presence of American troops further intensifies the already tense political situation in South Korea; they encourage, instigate, and incite the South Korean police force and the semi-fascist thugs who cooperate with them to use arbitrary, violent, and terrorist actions against the people. It is clear that if the American troops do not withdraw from Korea, the voters will not be guaranteed freedom to express their will.

As for the opinions expressed here by some representatives regarding the gradual withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, we do not oppose it in principle, as long as the principle of proportionality is observed in this process.

We propose that a concrete discussion be held on the date of withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea.

We cannot ignore the fact that the South Korean representative maliciously rejected our proposal that all countries with the greatest concern for maintaining peace in the Far East should undertake corresponding obligations to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea. The South Korean representative put forward his own proposal, saying that "the territorial integrity and independence of a unified, independent, and democratic Korea should be guaranteed by the United Nations," in opposition to our proposal that the major powers should play a particularly important role in guaranteeing the peaceful development of Korea. The South Korean proposal that the United Nations should guarantee the "territorial integrity and independence of a unified...Korea" can only be considered as an intention to prevent the conference from passing a resolution on maintaining and consolidating peace in Korea.

We believe that the solution to the issue of guaranteeing peace in Korea should not be postponed until after Korean unification.

Unless the conference makes a clear resolution on guaranteeing the peaceful development of Korea and eliminating the threat of the recurrence of the Korean War, the conference cannot complete its most important task.

The South Korean representative suggested that the all-Korean National Assembly to be established should undertake a whole series of obligations in advance. This is actually equivalent to maintaining the South Korean regime and expanding it to the whole of Korea.

In addition, his proposal also suggests that the unified Korean government must accept the South Korean constitution as its fundamental law.

In this regard, we must first state that the question of Korea's future constitution and all other internal affairs such as the election of the president are not issues that the current conference can consider and decide, because this is entirely within the jurisdiction of the Korean people themselves and their legislative body to be established.

However, since the South Korean representative is also obviously intending to come to a decision on this issue, so that they can impose the laws and people they are currently using to implement their policy of suppressing the people in South Korea on North Korea, we are willing to express some opinions on the South Korean constitution. What kind of constitution is this that the South Korean representative is suggesting to impose on the Korean people?

The constitution passed by the South Korean National Assembly in July 1948, despite all the trappings of democracy, is essentially anti-democratic and anti-people.

The South Korean constitution covers up the deception and plunder of the peasants. Article 86 of the constitution hypocritically declares that land should be distributed to the peasants. But the same article also stipulates: "The methods of distribution, the limits of possession, and the nature and limitations of ownership shall be determined by law." This article clearly shows that the constitution does not return the land to the peasants, but leaves this issue to be resolved by the Syngman Rhee ruling group, which is composed of landlords, big businessmen, and their protectors.

Under the guise of land reform, the ruling group not only did not return the land to the peasants, but instead carried out another round of plunder against the peasants.

In contrast to this, the constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea resolved the land issue in accordance with the interests of the peasants.

Article 6 of the Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea stipulates:
"Confiscate the land owned by the former Japanese state, Japanese people, and Korean landlords. Abolish the tenant system forever. Implement 'land to the tiller'."

Does the South Korean representative really think that the North Korean peasants will give up their land and willingly put on the yoke of being oppressed by the South Korean landlords?

The situation in South Korean factories is the same.

As under Japanese occupation, factories, power stations, and banks are still owned by large chaebols, while workers live in poverty, deprived of basic rights, and subjected to brutal exploitation.

There is no social insurance or labor protection there, and workers' wages are reduced to the lowest level.

In North Korea, who would agree to hand over the factories and banks that belong to the people to large monopoly capitalists simply because there is such a regime based on its constitution in South Korea?

In the twenty-three articles of the chapter on "Rights and Obligations of the People" in the South Korean constitution, eighteen articles include provisions that preempt the possibility of these articles taking effect.

If every article of the fundamental law can be restricted by the police authorities or government orders, and in fact has been restricted in this way, then one has to ask: what is left in this fundamental law?

For example, Article 13 of the South Korean Constitution states: "The freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association of the people shall not be restricted unless by law."

As everyone knows, in South Korea, all democratic groups and parties that have made efforts to defend the interests of the people have been suppressed.

Therefore, the statement that no one's freedom is restricted is just a lie. The truth is that all those who attempt to exercise freedom of speech, publication, assembly, etc., are subjected to cruel persecution by the police.

The South Korean representative said here hypocritically that all citizens of Korea, regardless of their ethnicity, should enjoy democratic rights.

In fact, the South Korean constitution does not provide for such rights.

So, what does this mean? This only shows the extremely reactionary nature of the South Korean constitution.

Recognizing that citizens of all nationalities residing in a country enjoy equal rights is the most basic provision of today's democratic constitutions.

Only the fascists in Germany and Japan did not recognize the civil rights of residents of other nationalities.

As pointed out in the official report submitted by the "United Nations Commission on Korea" to the Fourth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the South Korean constitution has "no clear provisions for holding the executive authorities accountable to the legislative authorities."

Therefore, this South Korean constitution, which they want to force on the Korean people, guarantees Syngman Rhee's complete dictatorship. Syngman Rhee, as the president of South Korea, is faithfully carrying out the wishes of the monopoly capitalists on the other side of the ocean.

The current conference must not consider the South Korean representative's proposal to apply Syngman Rhee's constitution to the whole of Korea. The Korean constitution must be drafted and approved by the Korean National Assembly established after the all-Korean elections.

Therefore, it is wrong to force the future National Assembly to undertake obligations that violate the interests and democratic aspirations of the Korean people in advance.

The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that if the participants in this conference sincerely wish to resolve the Korean question by peacefully unifying Korea on a democratic basis, then the proposals we have put forward, as well as the proposal put forward by the People's Republic of China to hold elections throughout the territory of Korea under the supervision of a neutral agency composed of countries that did not participate in the Korean War, are a good basis for this solution.

### 在日内瓦会议六月五日会议上  南日外务相的发言

    在日内瓦会议六月五日会议上
    南日外务相的发言主席、各位代表先生：
    在朝鲜问题的讨论过程中，对于实现朝鲜的国家统一和以和平方法建立单一、独立和民主的国家这个任务，表现出了两种不同的态度。
    一方面，在四月二十七日，当日内瓦会议开始的时候，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团就提出了“关于恢复朝鲜的国家统一和举行全朝鲜自由选举”的具体建议。这些建议规定在北朝鲜和南朝鲜协议的基础上，在排除外国干涉及地方政权当局和恐怖集团对选民施加压力的自由气氛中，举行全朝鲜的选举。因此，我们代表团是从保证朝鲜人民的民族利益的必要性出发的，并考虑到朝鲜当前的实际情况。
    另一方面，南朝鲜代表团在五月二十二日提出了它的建议。这些建议规定，在南朝鲜仍为外国军队所占领的条件下，在使北朝鲜隶属于靠这些外国军队帮助建立的南朝鲜政权的基础上，举行选举。提出这种建议的人丝毫不愿冷静地考虑存在于朝鲜两个部分的实际情况。南朝鲜代表团直到日内瓦会议开始的将近一个月以后才提出建议，这一事实就证明了南朝鲜当局对于实事求是地讨论朝鲜问题的和平解决是不感兴趣的。
    南朝鲜代表团的建议抱住一种恶毒的思想不放，这种思想的基础就是美国及追随它的国家阴谋迫使朝鲜民主主义人民共和国屈服于李承晚的政权。研究一下南朝鲜代表所提出的建议，就可以很容易看出这一点。
    南朝鲜的建议完全忽视了最重要的问题之一，就是建立一个全朝鲜机构来准备和举行选举，并解决朝鲜两部分之间恢复文化和经济关系的问题。很明显，不建立这样一个全朝鲜机构，在求得朝鲜两部分都能接受的协议方面就不可能有任何进展。
    由于在朝鲜实际上存在着两个政府，每个政府都有它自己的立法机关，要按照只在朝鲜的一部分有效的法律或决定来解决任何上述问题，都是不可能的。但是，南朝鲜代表建议，全朝鲜国民议会的选举不是根据由一个全朝鲜机构制订的、为双方都可接受的选举法来举行，而是根据南朝鲜的所谓“宪法程序”来举行。
    南朝鲜代表和某些其他代表团反对建立一个全朝鲜机构，曾在这里举出站不住脚的论点说，这样一个机构会代替政府机构，并强使他们接受不能接受的、片面的决定。这种可能性是绝对不会有的，首先，因为按照规定，这个机构是由双方组成的，它的一切决定都不是按照这一方或是那一方的代表的意志作出来的，而是由组成的双方共同协议后得出来的。为了想阻挠在全朝鲜机构问题上达成协议，某些代表不断暗示说，在建立这个机构的时候有必要采取比例代表制的原则，那就是说，每一方参加机构的代表人数应该和它的人口数目成比例，因此，在那个机构中应以多数表决制通过决定。为了说明这种立场的没有道理，除了我们以前所提出过的种种理由之外，我们还可以提醒这些代表注意一些历史例子，从这些例子里我们可以看出，作为一个国家从分裂进入统一——那就是说和朝鲜目前的情况相似——的步骤，成立立法机构的时候，也根本没有认为上述原则是必要的。我们可以特别用美国历史上的例子来提醒美国代表。大家知道，在十八世纪末，参加了当时组成的美利坚联邦的各州代表大会被宣布为这个联邦的中央权力机构，各州在大会中解决任何问题时都有平等权利。而当时各州人口的数目远不是相等的。譬如，在一七九零年，弗吉尼亚州有七十四万七千居民，宾夕法尼亚州有四十三万四千人，特拉华州只有五万九千人。但这并不妨碍上述各州代表以同等权利参加大会。
    还有另外一些类似的历史事例，例如，在瑞士，参加统一国家的各州在一八一五年也是在各州平等代表权的基础上组成议会来作为中央权力机构的，尽管这些州的人口众寡悬殊，譬如，伯尔尼州的人口大约是苏格州的二十三倍，大约是乌利州的三十倍。
    这些历史事实足以说明那些反对建立全朝鲜机构的人们的论点是站不住脚的。
    某些代表不是在帮助会议找出一条道路来使南北朝鲜和解，在对朝鲜人民有切身重要意义的争执问题上达成彼此都能接受的协议，而是继续不断地歪曲我们的建议的实质，硬说这一建议会使得全朝鲜机构中的一方将自己的意志强加于另一方。但是，正如我们已经一再说明过的，我们的建议是：双方中的无论哪一方都不能将自己的意志强加于另一方，只有经过全朝鲜机构中双方的协议才能作出决定。但是，某些代表似乎是不喜欢这一点的，因为他们在这里主张应给予李承晚政权独断独行地决定应由南北朝鲜协议的问题的权利。南朝鲜代表建议，监督选举的任务不应当如中华人民共和国代表团所提出并为我们所支持的建议那样，由中立国代表们所组成的委员会来执行，而应由联合国来执行。然而大家知道，联合国是交战一方，因此，当然是不能在朝鲜问题上起一个客观的机构的作用的，尤其是在全朝鲜选举这样一件事情上。换句话说，南朝鲜代表反对让一个由没有参加干涉朝鲜的国家的代表组成的真正公正的国际机构来监督选举。无须说得，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团不能同意由联合国监督全朝鲜选举的建议。毫无疑问，只有中立国委员会才能保证对朝鲜选举实行公正的监督。
    南朝鲜代表提议美国军队继续驻留在朝鲜，但同时又提议撤退中国人民志愿军部队。这种建议很清楚地说明了南朝鲜政权害怕面对朝鲜人民，并表示了它在执行反人民的政策中竭力想倚靠外国军队的刺刀。南朝鲜代表的这种建议的实质，就是企图把朝鲜民主主义人民共和国放在不平等的地位，并企图造成可能重新来使北朝鲜隶属于南朝鲜政权之下的条件。在我们以前的几次发言中，我们已经表示过，这样一种建议是站不住脚的，是不能接受的。
    为了使选举能够真正自由，使南朝鲜的选民能够自由表达他们的意志，在中国人民志愿军撤出北朝鲜的同时，美国军队必须撤出南朝鲜。美国军队的驻留使南朝鲜的已经够紧张的政治局势更加紧张；他们鼓励、教唆并煽动南朝鲜警察部队以及和它们合作的半法西斯匪徒用专横、强暴和恐怖的行动来对付人民。很明显，如果美国军队不撤出朝鲜，选民们表达自己的意志的自由就没有保障。
    至于有些代表在这里表示过的一切外国军队从朝鲜逐渐撤退的意见，我们原则上并不反对，只要在这当中遵守按比例的原则。
    我们建议对一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的日期进行具体讨论。
    我们不能放过这个事实：南朝鲜代表极其恶意地拒绝了我们所提出的由所有对维护远东和平具有最大关心的国家承担相应的义务来保证朝鲜的和平发展的建议。南朝鲜代表提出了他自己的建议说，“统一、独立、民主的朝鲜的领土完整和独立应由联合国加以保证”，来反对我们的关于各大国在保证朝鲜的和平发展方面应起特别重大的作用的建议。南朝鲜的由联合国来保证“统一……的朝鲜的领土完整和独立”的建议，只能被认为是打算阻止会议对维护和巩固朝鲜和平问题通过决议。
    我们认为：保证朝鲜和平的问题的解决，不应当推到朝鲜统一之后。
    除非会议在保证朝鲜的和平发展和消除朝鲜战争再起的威胁的问题上作出明确的决议，会议就不能完成它的最重要的任务。
    南朝鲜代表建议，所要成立的全朝鲜国民议会应当预先承担一整串的义务。这实际上就等于保持南朝鲜政权，并且把它扩张到全朝鲜。
    此外，他的建议还提出：统一的朝鲜政府必须接受南朝鲜的宪法作为它的根本法。
    在这方面，我们必须首先声明，关于朝鲜将来的宪法问题以及诸如总统的选举等其他一切内政问题，不是目前会议所能考虑和决定的问题，因为这完全是朝鲜人民自己以及所要建立的他们的立法机构的权限范围之内的事情。
    但是，既然南朝鲜代表在这个问题上也显然正打算得出一项决定，以便他们把那些他们目前借以在南朝鲜实行镇压人民政策的法律和人物强加在北朝鲜头上，我们愿意对南朝鲜的宪法发表一些意见。南朝鲜代表建议加在朝鲜人民头上的这种宪法，是什么样子的呢？
    南朝鲜国会一九四八年七月通过的宪法，尽管有一切冒充民主的措辞，实质上是反民主反人民的。
    南朝鲜的宪法遮掩了对农民的欺骗和掠夺。宪法第八十六条伪善地宣布，土地应分配予农民。但是在同一条内又规定：“分配之方法，占有之限度，及所有权之性质及限制以法律定之。”这一条清楚地表明，宪法并不把土地归给农民，而是把这个问题交给由地主、大商人以及他们的保护人组成的李承晚统治集团来解决。
    统治集团在土地改革的形式下，不但没有把土地交给农民，反而对农民进行了另一种掠夺。
    和这成对比的是：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的宪法根据农民的利益解决了土地问题。
      朝鲜民主主义人民共和国宪法第六条规定：
  “没收以前日本国家、日本人所有的土地及朝鲜地主所有的土地。永远废除租佃制度。实行耕者有其田。”
    南朝鲜代表真是认为北朝鲜农民会放弃他们的土地，甘心情愿地为自己套上受南朝鲜地主压迫的枷锁吗？
    南朝鲜的工厂的情况也是一样。
    和在日本占领之下一样，工厂、电力站和银行等直到现在都为大财阀占有，而工人却生活在贫困中，被剥夺了基本的权利，受到残酷的剥削。
    在那里没有社会保险或劳动保护，工人的工资缩减到了最低的程度。
    在北朝鲜，谁能只是因为在南朝鲜存在着这样一个以它的宪法为基础的政权，就会同意把那些属于人民的工厂和银行交给大垄断资本家呢？
    在南朝鲜宪法的“人民之权利义务”一章的二十三个条款中，有十八条包括了预先排除这些条款可能生效的规定。
    如果根本法的每一个条款都能由警察当局或政府的命令来加以限制、而且实际上也的确受到了这种限制的话，那么大家就不得不问：在这个根本法里还能剩下些什么呢？
    例如，在南朝鲜宪法第十三条中这样说：“人民言论、出版、集会及结社之自由，非依法律，不得加以限制。”
    大家知道，在南朝鲜，凡是为保卫人民利益而作过努力的民主的团体和政党都受到镇压。
    因此，任何人的自由都不受限制的说法只是个谎话。真实的情况是：所有那些企图运用言论、出版、集会等自由的人，都受到警察的残酷迫害。
    南朝鲜代表在这里假惺惺地说，朝鲜的所有公民，不问属于哪一民族，都应得到民主权利。
    事实上，南朝鲜的宪法并没有规定这种权利。
    那末，这说明什么呢？这不过说明南朝鲜的宪法的反动透顶的性质。
    承认居住在一国之内的一切民族的公民都享有平等权利，这是今天的民主宪法的起码条款。
    只有德国和日本的法西斯主义者才不承认其他民族的居民的公民权利。
    正如“联合国朝鲜委员会”向联合国第四届大会提出的正式报告中所指出的，南朝鲜的宪法对于“责令行政当局向立法当局负责一节无明确之规定”。
    因此，这个想拿来硬加在朝鲜人民头上的南朝鲜宪法，保证了李承晚的完全独裁。李承晚作为南朝鲜的总统，正忠实地执行着大洋彼岸垄断资本家的愿望。
    目前的会议决不能考虑南朝鲜代表提出的使李承晚的宪法适用于全朝鲜的建议。朝鲜宪法必须由全朝鲜选举后成立的朝鲜国民议会来拟订并批准。
    因此，预先强迫未来的国民议会承担违反朝鲜人民利益和民主愿望的义务，那是错误的。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团认为，如果参加本会议的人真诚地愿意通过在民主的基础上和平统一朝鲜来解决朝鲜问题，那末我们所提出的建议，以及中华人民共和国所提出的在由没有参加朝鲜战争的国家组成的中立机构的监督下在全朝鲜领土上举行选举的建议，就是这种解决的良好基础。
