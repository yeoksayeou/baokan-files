Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st. The People's Liberation Army construction engineering units participating in the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant have fully commenced operations in various work areas in May. The construction of the main factory buildings and living quarters, which broke ground this year, is being intensified day and night. When the lights in the homes of residents near the factory are turned off, the construction site of the People's Liberation Army construction engineering units is still brightly lit, as they are engaged in a bustling labor competition. Thousands of truckloads of mud are transported from the site every day, and thousands of truckloads of concrete are poured. They are striving to complete the foundation work of these factory buildings before the first anniversary of the start of construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, to create conditions for the steel roof truss installation and hoisting工程 which will begin in the autumn.

The main factory buildings that started construction this year are all metal structure buildings, with complex engineering structures and strict technical requirements. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army construction engineering units, who have been tempered by construction last year, have initially mastered the operating techniques of large-scale mechanized construction. Some combat heroes who had previously made meritorious service on the battlefield are now demonstrating their skills on the industrial construction front, constantly setting the highest records for the entire construction site. For example, the Liu Yuanzhu team of the Second Platoon of the First Section of the Foundry Workshop exceeded the earthwork project task by 83 percent on the first day of construction by breaking through the barrier of the frozen soil layer. When Soviet experts discovered this, they immediately rushed to the site to congratulate the Liu Yuanzhu team and promoted their experience of "fighting against the frozen soil layer" to the entire construction site. The next day, the Huo Jietang team came from the dormitory project and learned the method of digging frozen soil from the Liu Yuanzhu team. At the same time, they improved the labor organization and surpassed the record of the Liu Yuanzhu team. They completed the original four-day task in two and a half days, and the entire team was awarded collective merit. The soldiers who participated in the construction engineering units humbly learn mechanized construction methods from veteran skilled workers, and at the same time, they actively unite with the workers of the mechanized supply station to cooperate with their construction. The soldiers of the foundry workshop and the truck drivers jointly created a "native crane" to hoist mud from deep pits to dump trucks, which is fast and labor-saving, and improves the efficiency of transporting mud. Zhang Kewen, a truck driver who cooperated with the construction of the forging workshop, proposed a competition with the soldiers, guaranteeing "stable running and fast unloading," creating a record of transporting a truck of soil every nine minutes on average, which strongly ensured the smooth completion of the construction task.

    在第一汽车制造厂工地上
    解放军建筑工程部队各工区展开劳动竞赛
    【新华社沈阳一日电】中国人民解放军参加第一汽车制造厂建筑工程部队所在的各个工区已在五月内全面动工了。今年破土动工的各工场的主厂房和生活间的各项工程正夜以继日地加紧施工。当工厂附近居民家里的灯光都已熄灭的时候，人民解放军建筑工程部队工地上仍然是灯火辉煌，他们在进行着热火朝天的劳动竞赛。现场上每天要运出装满几千辆载重卡车的泥土，浇灌上千辆卡车的混凝土。他们要在第一汽车制造厂开工一周年的前夕，完成这几座厂房的基础工程，为秋后开始的钢屋架装吊工程创造条件。
    今年动工的主要厂房，都是金属结构建筑，工程结构复杂、技术要求极为严格。经过去年施工锻炼的人民解放军建筑工程部队的勇士们，初步掌握了大规模机械化施工的操作技术。一些曾经在战场上杀敌立功的战斗英雄，又在工业建设战线上大显身手，不断地创造出全工地的最高纪录。例如铸工场第一工段二中队刘元柱小组，在开工第一天便突破了冻土层的障碍，超额百分之八十三完成了土方工程任务。苏联专家发现了，立刻赶到现场向刘元柱小组表示祝贺，并把他们创造的“向冻土层作斗争”的经验，向全工地推广。第二天霍界堂小组从宿舍工程赶来，学习了刘元柱小组挖冻土的办法，同时改进了劳动组织，又超过了刘元柱小组的纪录，原来四天的任务，他们两天半就完成了，全组立了集体功。这支参加建筑工程部队的战士们，虚心向老技术工人学习机械化施工方法，同时主动地团结机械化供应站配合他们施工的工人。铸工场的战士和汽车司机共同创造了一种“土吊车”，从深坑里向自卸汽车吊运泥土，既快又省工，提高了搬运泥土的效率。配合锻工场施工的汽车司机张克文提出和战士们竞赛，保证“跑的稳，卸的快”，创造平均九分钟运一车土的最高纪录，有力地保证了施工任务的顺利完成。
