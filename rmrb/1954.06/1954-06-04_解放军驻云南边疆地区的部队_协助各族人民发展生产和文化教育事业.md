Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd:

    People's Liberation Army troops stationed in the Yunnan border region are actively uniting with the people of all ethnic groups, including the Dai, Jingpo, and Kawa, assisting them in developing production, culture, and education, and jointly consolidating the southwestern defense of the motherland.
    Commanders and soldiers of the border defense troops regard assisting border people in developing production as an important task in defending and building the border. In the past year alone, a certain unit stationed in southern Yunnan helped the ethnic minority people in the area with rice transplanting and harvesting, contributing more than 26,400 workdays; helped the people with rice pounding, contributing 110,000 workdays; and caught more than 2,400 catties of insects. In many places, the ethnic minority people did not know how to grow vegetables and had long used leaves as vegetables. The soldiers obtained vegetable seeds from the interior of the motherland and taught the ethnic minority people how to grow vegetables. As a result, spinach, radishes, cabbage, eggplants, tomatoes, etc., also flourished on the borderland. Soldiers of a certain unit also built more than 30 thatched houses and gave them to the local poor residents who lacked housing. When the new houses were completed, people from nearby villages came to congratulate them, gratefully saying: The People's Liberation Army has brought us warmth and happiness!
    The border defense troops widely publicize the Party's policies among the people of all ethnic groups and assist them in developing cultural and educational undertakings. Film projection teams and art troupes from the troops often tour and perform among the people of all ethnic groups and hold photo exhibitions; cadres and soldiers from the troops also often hold report meetings, seminars, and individual visits among the people to publicize the Party's ethnic policies, the achievements of the motherland's construction, the victory of the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and the strength of the world peace and democracy camp, thus raising the awareness of the people of all ethnic groups. In many villages in southern and western Yunnan, the troops have also established many primary schools for local residents and selected soldiers with higher cultural levels and who understand the local language to serve as teachers in the schools. A machine gun company of a certain unit opened three primary schools in a certain place in southern Yunnan, giving more than 140 children of the Miao and other ethnic groups the opportunity to study. The soldiers also donated their allowances to buy 127 textbooks for the children.
    In many mountainous areas on the Yunnan border, miasma often permeates the air. During the era of Kuomintang reactionary rule, the local people did not have access to scientific knowledge and necessary medicines and could only rely on "sending gods" to cure diseases, so many people died every year. After the border defense troops were stationed in these areas, they specially dispatched medical personnel, carrying vaccines and medicines, to visit residents in every village and household to treat diseases. In the past year alone, the troops stationed in a certain place in southern Yunnan treated 11,568 patients (more than 8,000 of whom have recovered) and vaccinated more than 12,900 people. The soldiers also assisted the local people in carrying out sanitation campaigns, clearing garbage and waste near residences, and explaining basic hygiene knowledge to the residents. As a result, the sanitary conditions of the people of all ethnic groups in the border region have greatly improved.
    The border defense troops assist the people of all ethnic groups in building roads, bridges, dams, and other buildings, and also assist the government's trade departments in transporting large quantities of salt, daily necessities, etc., to the villages and towns in the border areas, continuously improving the material lives of the people.
    The exemplary actions of the People's Liberation Army border defense troops in loving the people have won the enthusiastic support of the people of all ethnic groups. The people of all ethnic groups in the border areas call the People's Liberation Army troops "the defenders of all ethnic groups," and they automatically assist the troops in patrolling, standing guard, leading the way, providing information, and delivering grain and vegetables to the troops when pursuing and suppressing remnants of bandits, making the motherland's border defense even more solid.

    解放军驻云南边疆地区的部队
    协助各族人民发展生产和文化教育事业
    【新华社三日讯】中国人民解放军驻云南边疆地区的部队积极团结傣族、景颇族、佧瓦族等各兄弟民族人民，协助各族人民发展生产和文化、教育事业，和各族人民共同巩固了祖国的西南国防。
    边防部队的指挥员和战斗员们把协助边疆人民发展生产，当作保卫和建设边疆的重要任务。仅驻滇南某地区的部队，在去年一年中就帮助驻区兄弟民族人民插秧、收割等，出了二万六千四百多个工；帮助人民捣米，出了十一万个工，并且捕虫二千四百多斤。许多地方的兄弟民族人民不会种菜，长久以来以树叶子当菜吃。战士们就从祖国的内地搞来菜籽，教兄弟民族人民种菜。于是像菠菜、萝卜、小白菜、茄子、西红柿等也在边疆土地上盛长起来了。某部的战士们还盖了三十多间草房，交给当地缺少房屋的贫苦居民住。在新房落成时，附近村寨的人民都赶来道贺，他们感激地说：人民解放军给我们带来了温暖和幸福！
    边防部队广泛地在各族人民中宣传党的政策，协助各族人民发展文化和教育事业。部队中的电影放映队、文艺工作队经常在各族人民中巡回演出，并且举办图片展览；部队中的干部、战士还时常在人民中举行报告会、座谈会和进行个别访问等，向广大居民宣传了党的民族政策、祖国建设的成就、抗美援朝斗争的胜利和世界和平民主阵营的壮大等，提高了各族人民的觉悟。在滇南、滇西的许多村寨中，部队还为当地居民开办了许多小学校，并选派了文化水平较高的和懂得当地语言的战士充当学校的教员。某部机炮连曾在滇南某地开办了三所小学校，使一百四十多个苗族和其他民族的儿童得到了读书的机会。战士们还捐出自己的津贴费，为儿童们买了一百二十七本课本。
    在云南边境的许多山区中，经常弥漫着瘴气。在国民党反动统治的年代里，当地人民得不到科学知识和必需的医药，只有靠“送神”治病，因此每年都死亡许多人。边防部队驻到这些地区后，便专门派出医务人员，携带着疫苗、医药，挨村挨户为居民治病。在去年一年中，驻在滇南某地的部队就为当地一万一千五百六十八个病人治了病（其中八千多个病人已经痊愈）和为一万二千九百多人种了牛痘。战士们还协助当地人民开展卫生运动，清除住宅附近的垃圾和污物，向居民讲解卫生常识。因此，边疆地区各族人民的卫生状况，已经有了很大的改善。
    边防部队协助各族人民修筑公路、桥梁、堤坝和其他建筑物，还协助政府贸易部门把大量盐巴、日用品等，源源不断地运到边境地区的村寨和镇市里，改善着人民的物质生活。
    人民解放军边防部队热爱人民的模范行动，获得各族人民的热烈拥护。边疆各族人民称人民解放军部队是“各族人民的保卫者”，他们自动协助部队巡逻、放哨，在追歼残匪时给部队带路、报信和送粮、送菜等，使祖国的边防更加巩固起来。
