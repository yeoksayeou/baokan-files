    Beijing, Shenyang, Chongqing, and Guangzhou People from All Walks of Life
    Warmly Support the Draft Constitution
     [This newspaper's report] The people of the capital greeted the publication of the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" with joy and excitement.
    Yesterday morning, as the ancient and magnificent city was just awakening, the news of the promulgation of the Draft Constitution spread throughout the streets. Along the streets and in front of the newspaper reading boards, people were reading and discussing the Draft Constitution in groups.
    Wherever the newspaper arrived, a joyous atmosphere immediately appeared. Railway workers at the Beijing Railway Station, who had worked all night, were about to get off work to rest when a post office car with large red banners brought the newly published People's Daily. Everyone bought a copy. After reading the Draft Constitution, Zhang Wencai, an old worker who has been serving on the railway for more than 20 years, said: In the past, laws suppressed the people, but now this constitution protects the people. What we have been looking forward to for many years has been realized today. The broadcast loudspeaker of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant broadcast the news of the promulgation of the Draft Constitution early in the morning. In the northern dormitory of the Shijingshan Power Plant, colorful flags were raised to celebrate this great happy event. Construction workers in the Soviet Exhibition Hall construction area, who were carrying out renovation work, were so happy after hearing the broadcast from the People's Radio yesterday morning that they took dozens of red flags and paraded in teams from the dormitory to the construction site, beating gongs and drums. The members of the youth shock brigade of carpenters gathered together to hold the first discussion meeting on the Draft Constitution during their rest time. Yesterday noon, the newspaper arrived at the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, one of the earliest birthplaces of the Chinese workers' movement with a glorious revolutionary tradition. Many old workers and labor models, as well as young workers, who had participated in the "February 7th" strike, gathered in the trade union office. Thirty-one years ago, this small Western-style building was the office of Zhao Jixian, one of the murderers of the workers, where he issued orders to stop the strike and massacre the workers. Now, the workers are excitedly discussing the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China here. Old worker Zuo Shijun, who served as a picket during the "February 7th" strike, and old workers He Fengting and Li Zhenshan, all expressed their feelings about the promulgation of the Draft Constitution. He Fengting said: The Draft Constitution stipulates that our working class is the leading class. We should be more organized, disciplined, and exemplarily abide by the national law, and lead the people of the country well in building socialism.
    On the walls of the state-owned Shuangqiao Farm, large-character posters announcing the promulgation of the Draft Constitution were posted. Workers surrounded the newspaper readers. Jia Jixiang, a young tractor driver, expressed his desire to double his efforts to complete the task, so that the state-owned farm can play an exemplary role in guiding farmers to take the road of collectivization and mechanization.
    The heroes who were wounded on the Korean battlefield and whose health was lost in long-term battles, who were recuperating in the hospital, enthusiastically cheered when the newspaper carrying the Draft Constitution arrived: "Our Draft Constitution has been promulgated!" Everyone felt that the promulgation of the Draft Constitution brought them new strength and a firm belief in defending the motherland.
    The Ethnic Minorities and Religious Circles Subcommittee of the Beijing Draft Constitution Discussion Committee held a plenary meeting of all members and group conveners yesterday. More than ten representatives of ethnic minorities and religious circles, including the famous folk artist Lian Kuoru (Manchu), Ju Zan, a standing director of the Buddhist Association of China, Wang Zizhong, a pastor of the North China Congregational Church of the Chinese Christian Church, and Tai Yuanzhen, the living Buddha of Yonghe Temple, spoke at the meeting, expressing their heartfelt support for the Draft Constitution and explaining the democratic nature of the Draft Constitution with their own personal experiences. They were most satisfied with the articles concerning ethnic and religious policies in the Draft Constitution.
    All universities broadcast the news of the promulgation of the Draft Constitution to all teachers, students, and staff early yesterday morning. Renmin University of China was having exams, and all teachers and students automatically used their lunch break time yesterday to read the documents on the Draft Constitution in the newspapers.
    The Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce also convened a standing committee yesterday to discuss and adopt a plan for the industrial and commercial circles to publicize and discuss the Draft Constitution, and at the same time made a resolution to warmly support the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.
    From today onwards, the suburban districts and urban districts of Beijing will successively convene the first People's Congress, and all districts will include the publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution as an important agenda item.
      [Northeast Daily, Shenyang Dispatch] People from all walks of life in Shenyang warmly support the Draft Constitution. The city's newspaper retail sales have increased from less than 10,000 copies per day to more than 49,000 copies. After reading the Draft Constitution, Shen Ronggang, an old worker at the state-owned Seventh Rubber Factory, said: After the liberation of the Northeast, I found a job and also lived in a big building. There are cars to pick me up to and from work. In the old society, I had no job, and two of my children starved to death. The Draft Constitution is the result of the victory of the struggle of our people. I must use practical actions to consolidate it. Members of the Wanquan Vegetable Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Shenyang competed to read newspapers. In the old society, they mostly lived on eating leaves and bran. Now, they have embarked on the road to common prosperity. The state lent them 100 million yuan in production funds, and the cooperative bought seven large mules and a lot of fertilizer. Zhang Kuiwu, director of the cooperative, said: With the Communist Party, we have such a good life. Now, the Draft Constitution fixes the great achievements our country has made in all aspects in the form of law, and also reflects our common desire—to realize a socialist society. Lin Xinglong, a student at a military school in Shenyang, has been awarded nine major merits. After seeing the Draft Constitution, he said: Our Draft Constitution stipulates: "The armed forces of the People's Republic of China belong to the people. Its mission is to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and to defend the security of the country and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty." This makes us feel very honored. Cui Lianhe, a teacher at Shenyang No. 7 Middle School, said: I have been teaching for twenty-eight years, and my work had no guarantee in the past. Since the founding of New China, educators have been respected. I must actively study this Draft Constitution and publicize it to the people. Gong Tianmin, chairman of the Shenyang Federation of Industry and Commerce, said after reading the Draft Constitution that he would organize the industrial and commercial circles in Shenyang to study the Draft Constitution.
    [Chongqing Xinhua Daily Dispatch] On the morning of the fifteenth, although it was drizzling, people still went to the streets early to wait for the newspapers publishing the Draft Constitution. The entrances of post offices on Jiefang Road and Minquan Road were crowded with people buying newspapers. Around eight o'clock, when newspaper sellers appeared on the street, workers going to work, housewives buying groceries, and students with schoolbags under their arms all stopped to rush to buy newspapers. The workers of Jianxin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. rarely bought newspapers in retail in the past, but on this day they bought thirty copies. The No. 102 Steel Plant is far from the city, and the workers could not wait. The trade union first introduced the content of the Draft Constitution to the workers through broadcasting. Tang Ruifu, a special-grade industrial labor model in Chongqing, said: The Draft Constitution represents the interests of our working class and other strata of the people, and points out a bright future. Comparing the past suffering with the present happiness makes me feel that I have not worked hard enough, and I must work harder in the future. When the newspapers arrived, members of the Xiaoshi Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Chongqing gathered together to listen to the full text of the Draft Constitution being read aloud. The members unanimously supported the provision for implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture.
   [Southern Daily, Guangzhou Dispatch] The promulgation of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has aroused warm welcome among the people from all walks of life in Guangzhou. When the newspapers containing the Draft Constitution were distributed to every corner of the city, the people rushed to read and discuss it.
    On the fifteenth, when the newspapers were delivered to various factories, construction sites, stations, and ships, the trade unions immediately posted the newspapers in prominent places and broadcast this great happy event to the production workshops. After work, the workers flocked to the library and the newspaper posting places to watch, reading the Draft Constitution word by word. When the workers read Article 1 of Chapter 1 of the Draft Constitution, "The People's Republic of China is a people's democratic country led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants," they felt particularly excited.
    Returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese also welcomed the Draft Constitution with joy and excitement. The Shepai Returned Overseas Chinese Hostel held a report meeting on the Draft Constitution. More than 1,200 returned overseas Chinese enthusiastically participated in listening to the report. In the library, the lounge, and the dormitory, people were carefully reading the Draft Constitution in groups of three or five, or reading it aloud with excitement. They were particularly excited about the fact that the Draft Constitution safeguards the interests of the people everywhere and protects the rights and interests of overseas Chinese. Xie Zhao, a worker who had just returned from Malaya, said excitedly: "I lived in Malaya for more than 20 years, and suffered from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, living a life like cattle and horses. After returning to the motherland, I received the care and attention of the country. Now the Draft Constitution clearly stipulates the maintenance of the interests of the people and the protection of the rights and interests of overseas Chinese, which really makes me deeply feel the happiness and glory of being a citizen of the People's Republic of China."
