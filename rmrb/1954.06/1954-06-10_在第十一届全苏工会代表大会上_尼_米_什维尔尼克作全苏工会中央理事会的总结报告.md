N.M. Shvernik, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, delivered a summary report of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions at the 11th All-Union Congress of Trade Unions on the 7th. The following is a summary:

Shvernik said that under the leadership of the Communist Party, Soviet trade unions have done tremendous work in mobilizing the broad masses of workers and staff to strive to complete and overfulfill national economic plans, and to achieve a sharp increase in various agricultural sectors and consumer goods production, which are the most important tasks.

The Soviet trade unions, created and educated by the Communist Party, while struggling for the continuous development of the socialist economy, have consolidated their ranks, and united workers and staff more closely around the Party and the government, which confidently lead our country along the path indicated by Lenin and the great successor to Lenin's cause, Stalin.

Shvernik said that the delegates to the congress listened with extreme satisfaction, great joy, and the greatest sense of responsibility to the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union.

Shvernik said, allow me, on behalf of the congress, to assure our Party Central Committee and our government: The Soviet trade unions will mobilize workers and staff to launch a new upsurge in labor to realize all the tasks that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union are unswervingly striving to solve.

Shvernik then spoke about the achievements of the Soviet working people in socialist construction. He cited many materials to prove that the Soviet people are victoriously implementing the plans formulated by the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The speed of development of socialist industry is something that even the most developed capitalist countries can only dream of.

Last year, the total industrial output increased by 45 percent compared to 1950. Soviet enterprises are constantly increasing production, improving product quality, and reducing costs. In the first three years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the total industrial output of the Soviet Union increased by 60 percent compared to 1950 solely due to the increase in labor productivity. Far-reaching measures to further improve the people's living standards are being implemented domestically. Thanks to the various measures taken by the Party and the government, the industrial sector produced 30 billion rubles worth of consumer goods more in the second half of 1953 than in the first half.

This year, the output of consumer goods will increase by about 60 percent compared to 1950. Therefore, the tasks of our country's Fifth Five-Year Plan will be victoriously completed and overfulfilled.

There is a different situation in capitalist countries, where the economy is increasingly militarized, and the arms race is intensifying, thereby enabling a small handful of capitalist monopolists to make huge fortunes, while causing unimaginable poverty and bankruptcy for millions of working people.

The deepening economic crisis in capitalist countries has created an atmosphere of terror and panic, and is making the living standards of the vast majority of people increasingly lower. The United States is particularly feeling the destructive effects of the growing economic crisis. There are currently about 15 million fully and partially unemployed people in the United States. The purchasing power of residents is constantly declining. The cost of living in the United States in the second half of 1953 increased by 21 percent compared to 1947, in the United Kingdom it increased by 40 percent, and in Italy it increased by 23 percent. The working people of colonial countries and dependent countries are in an extremely difficult situation.

Shvernik pointed out that disenfranchisement and intolerable oppression have aroused a wave of dissatisfaction among the masses in capitalist countries, prompting the increasing development of strike movements. The working people of capitalist countries are resolutely rising up to fight for their basic rights, for freedom and independence. The achievements of the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries, who are working for themselves instead of for capitalists, are inspiring the confidence of the working people of the world, and arousing them to fight against hunger, poverty, and disenfranchisement, to break free from the oppression of capitalism, and to strive for a bright future for mankind.

Shvernik then spoke in detail about the role of trade unions in developing the national economy and organizing socialist emulation. Soviet trade unions are leading the socialist emulation, guiding the efforts of the masses to discover new potentials for further improving labor productivity, in order to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. In the emulation, many production innovators and advanced producer cadres have emerged in various enterprises. At least the names of lathe operators Bykov and Kolesov, steelworkers Strukov and Kalmykov, blast furnace foreman Shatylin, construction worker Sirkov, tractor team leader Angellina, and weaver Kotova are known throughout the country.

Production innovators—these are the most skilled and technically proficient workers who are able to constantly and tirelessly discover production potentials, boldly utilize technology, and organize their labor according to new methods. They are the advanced laborers of Soviet society, and all workers and staff should learn from them. The task of the trade unions is to support all experiences and initiatives in every possible way, and make them the property of the broad masses of workers and staff.

Shvernik said that there is enormous potential for continuously improving labor productivity in our industry and agriculture. However, in many enterprises and in some sectors of the national economy, this potential has not been fully utilized. Although the labor productivity of workers in our entire industry had reached or exceeded pre-war levels as early as 1948, in the coal mining industry it did not reach pre-war levels until 1951, and some mines have still not reached this level to this day. The work of completing the labor productivity plan is also not progressing smoothly in the timber industry and construction enterprises.

Many valuable initiatives of production innovators have not been widely promoted. The leaders of various ministries, enterprises, and trade union organizations are often responsible for this situation. Some trade union staff members not only did not approve the initiatives of production innovators, but they also made decisions to promote them, and vociferously claimed that they would promote them, but they did not do any practical work in this regard.

The trade unions, first and foremost the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, have not led the rising creative initiative of the masses, but have weakened the leadership of socialist emulation in recent years, and have not made the promotion of the experience of production innovators their main work in production and mass work.

Socialist emulation—this is a living, creative undertaking. It cannot be treated with formalism and bureaucratic habits.

In many enterprises, trade union organizations often replace the organizational work of carrying out emulation with the compilation of various reports, materials, and the compilation of various registration forms for participants in the emulation. Bureaucratic situations occurred when summarizing the All-Union socialist emulation. When summarizing the emulation, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the central committees of various trade unions, and the relevant ministries only paid attention to advanced enterprises, did not study the reasons for the backwardness of some factories, machine tractor stations, and state farms, and did not formulate concrete measures to raise backward enterprises to the level of advanced enterprises. Factory committees and local committees should strive to actively involve all workers and staff in the emulation, and help them achieve a high level of labor productivity.

Production meetings have become a true school for conducting communist education among the masses in many enterprises, which is an important method for further developing the creative initiative of workers and engineering and technical personnel. At production meetings, workers and staff criticize errors and shortcomings, and decide on practical steps to improve labor productivity.

It is necessary to improve the work of trade unions in promoting workers' inventions and rationalization proposals, and to do everything possible to consolidate the work in labor discipline.

The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and the central committees of various trade unions should pay more attention to adjusting wages, and strive to eliminate egalitarianism in the wages of workers and staff.

Shvernik talked about the participation of various trade unions in the struggle to achieve a high tide in agriculture. Trade union organizations have implemented many measures to provide cultural and welfare services to the workers and staff of machine tractor stations and state farms in the reclaimed areas. A socialist emulation has now been launched to strive to increase the yield per unit area of ​​crops, to further increase the number of livestock and the productivity of livestock products, and to fully utilize tractors, combine harvesters, and other agricultural machinery.

The September 1953 plenary session and the February-March plenary session this year of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union put forward a task: to improve the working level of cultural and educational institutions in rural areas, to activate the activities of clubs and libraries, to regularly show movies, and to further use radio equipment in rural areas. This must be done so that every machine tractor station and state farm has a red corner and a mobile library. Trade union organizations should raise the requirements for economic leaders of machine tractor stations and state farms, who are responsible for providing housing to set up red corners, clubs, and libraries.

In terms of labor organization in machine tractor stations and state farms, and in the adoption of advanced industrial technology, the workers of industrial enterprises can often provide great help.

Shvernik said: Concern for the people's welfare is the highest principle of our Party and government. This concern is clearly reflected in: the continuous improvement of the material welfare and cultural level of the working class and peasants, the gradual reduction of consumer goods prices, and the large-scale construction of housing and cultural institutions. The investment in housing construction in 1954 increased by 35 percent compared to 1953, and the retail prices of consumer goods are now seven-twelfths lower than in 1947. Social insurance premiums are increasing year by year, and this year it is 24.7 billion rubles. Since the 10th All-Union Congress of Trade Unions, 13 million workers and staff have enjoyed the right to convalesce, and 12 million children of workers and staff have lived in Young Pioneer camps.

Shvernik said, but some of our economic workers and trade union leaders are indifferent to meeting the material and cultural needs of the working people. The Ministry of Petroleum Industry and the Ministry of Construction often fail to complete housing construction plans, and housing construction by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Soviet Union and the Ministry of State Farms of the Soviet Union is also not progressing well.

The central committees of various industrial trade unions and the factory and local trade union committees should inspect the construction of housing, public dormitories, and cultural welfare institutions, check whether housing is being correctly allocated, and check the maintenance of housing.

Expanding the trade and public dining in the Soviet Union is of great significance for improving the material welfare of the working people. Although retail trade is developing and the condition of public dining is improving, there are still serious shortcomings in this regard. There are not always enough goods in the stores, and the stores do not always get the various varieties of goods they need. There are also many cafeterias that do not cook delicious meals. The central committees of various industrial trade unions and the trade union councils should ensure that they regularly check the work of stores and cafeterias, and resolutely fight against phenomena that violate Soviet trade principles, and try to improve services to residents.

In our country, the state expenditure on social insurance, national education, and health care is increasing every year. In 1954, these expenditures increased to 141 billion rubles. The government has stipulated higher pensions for workers in the steel, coal mining, logging, chemical, and petroleum industries, maritime and inland water transport, railway transport, as well as teachers and medical workers. In 1953, the pensions of workers and staff increased fourfold compared to 1940. The network of sanatoriums and rest homes is rapidly expanding.

The Soviet Union allocates large amounts of funds to prepare comfortable and healthy working conditions for workers and staff. In the period mentioned, 9 billion rubles have been spent on improving safety facilities and industrial hygiene.

Shvernik then emphasized the important role of trade unions in conducting communist education among the working people. In 1953, 7.5 million people completed free refresher courses. Under the leadership of the Party, trade unions carry out various mass cultural activities in enterprises, agencies, public dormitories, clubs, and libraries. They organize lecture meetings, report meetings, seminars with production innovators, and entertainment evenings to help workers improve their cultural and technical level. Trade unions have 9,420 clubs and cultural palaces, more than 13,000 libraries, and 97,000 workers' recreation stations. There are more than 123,000 amateur art groups active in clubs and recreation stations. More than 2 million workers and staff participated in amateur art groups. However, the scale and ideological level of trade union cultural work still cannot meet the existing requirements. It is necessary to overcome the inertia and monotony in cultural institutions, enrich their work with highly ideological content, and make their work welcome to everyone. In the period covered by the report, trade unions took many measures to strengthen voluntary sports associations, and cultivated hundreds of thousands of activists—organizers and instructors. During this period, the number of sports organizations and athletes more than doubled. Trade union voluntary sports associations have cultivated more than 1 million skilled athletes. Today, half of the Soviet Union's national records and championship titles have been won by trade union athletes. They have created 18 world records.

Subsequently, Shvernik spoke in detail about the tasks of trade unions in improving the level of organizational work. He said: During the five-year period mentioned, trade union membership increased by 12 million. Various trade union organizations reported and conducted elections to the 11th All-Union Congress of Trade Unions. The activities of the various trade union committees were discussed with the展开批评和自我批评。 The speeches of trade union members were full of concern that the trade unions would continue to be the Party's fighting helpers, and that their role in national, economic, and cultural construction would continue to be strengthened.

Shvernik emphasized that the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the central committees of various trade unions, and the trade union councils should resolutely improve cadre work and strengthen ties with the masses. Bureaucracy and bureaucracy have not been eradicated in the work of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and the central, republican, border region, and state trade union committees and trade union councils. The various departments and administrations of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions have poor connections with various trade union organizations and rarely help them eliminate shortcomings.

Subsequently, Shvernik talked about the participation of Soviet trade unions in strengthening international worker solidarity and fighting for peace and democracy. Soviet trade unions are loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism and have established strong friendly relations and close cooperation with the working classes and trade unions of various countries. The participation of trade union representatives from various people's democratic countries and trade union representatives from capitalist countries and colonial dependent countries in the 11th All-Union Congress of Trade Unions significantly proves that the fraternal friendship and international labor solidarity of the working people are increasingly consolidated and strengthened.

In 1949, 463 foreign worker delegations from 62 countries visited the Soviet Union. During the same period, 269 Soviet trade union delegations visited various countries around the world at the invitation of trade unions in other countries.

Comrade Shvernik said: Today we can say with great satisfaction that we have unbreakable fraternal friendship and strong ties with the working people of the great People's Republic of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, the Mongolian People's Republic, the German Democratic Republic, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The ties between Soviet trade unions and the working class and trade union organizations in capitalist and colonial countries have been strengthened and have become closer.

Soviet trade unions and the working people of all countries are united in the World Federation of Trade Unions, which vividly embodies the unity of international trade union organizations in the struggle for a better life, for the democratic rights and freedoms of the working class, and for world peace. Soviet trade unions will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with the working people of other countries to defend the great cause of peace and strive to win victory in the struggle for a better future for working mankind.

In concluding his report, Shvernik emphasized that trade unions are the Communist Party's faithful helpers and reliable pillars in educating the working people to become active, loyal to the motherland, and builders of communist society. In the struggle to continue to prosper the socialist motherland and to continuously improve the material welfare and cultural level of the people, trade unions must unite the working people more closely around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    在第十一届全苏工会代表大会上
    尼·米·什维尔尼克作全苏工会中央理事会的总结报告
    全苏工会中央理事会主席尼·米·什维尔尼克七日在第十一届全苏工会代表大会上作了全苏工会中央理事会的总结报告。摘要如下：
    什维尔尼克说，苏联工会在共产党的领导下，在动员广大职工群众争取完成和超额完成国民经济计划，争取实现农业各部门和消费品生产的急剧提高这些最重要的任务方面，进行了巨大的工作。
    共产党所缔造的和教育起来的苏联工会，在为社会主义经济不断发展而斗争的同时，巩固了自己的队伍，把职工更加紧密地团结在满怀信心地领导我国沿着列宁和列宁事业的伟大继承者斯大林所指示的道路前进的党和政府的周围。
    什维尔尼克说道，大会代表们以极其满意的心情，以极大的愉快和最伟大的责任感倾听了苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议的贺电。
    什维尔尼克说道，请允许我代表大会向我们党中央委员会和我们政府提出保证：苏联工会要动员职工掀起新的劳动高潮，来实现苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议正在坚持不渝地争取解决的一切任务。
    什维尔尼克接着谈到苏联劳动人民在社会主义建设中所获的成就。他引证许多材料，证明苏联人民正在胜利地实现苏联共产党第十九次代表大会所制订的计划。社会主义工业发展的速度，即使是工业最发展的资本主义国家也是梦想不到的。
    去年工业生产总量比一九五零年增加了百分之四十五。苏联各企业正在不断地增加生产，改进产品质量和降低成本。在第五个五年计划的头三年中，单是由于劳动生产率的提高，苏联工业总产量就比一九五零年增加了百分之六十。进一步提高人民生活水平的长远的措施正在国内实行着。由于党和政府采取了各项措施，工业部门一九五三年下半年比上半年多生产了价值三百亿卢布的消费品。
    今年消费品的产量将比一九五零年约增加百分之六十。因而，我国第五个五年计划的任务将胜利完成和超额完成。
    资本主义国家有着另外一种情况，这些国家的经济日益军事化，扩张军备日益加紧，从而使得一小撮资本主义垄断资本家大发其财，而使千百万劳动人民遭到令人难以想像的贫穷和破产。
    资本主义国家中日益加深的经济危机造成了恐怖的气氛，并使人心惶惶，使绝大多数人民的生活水平越来越低。美国特别感觉到日益增长的经济危机的破坏作用。美国现在共约有一千五百万完全失业者和半失业者。居民的购买力不断下降。美国的生活费用一九五三年下半年比一九四七年增加了百分之二十一，英国增加了百分之四十，意大利增加了百分之二十三。殖民地国家和附属国的劳动人民处于极其艰难的境地。
    什维尔尼克指出，无权地位和不可忍受的压迫引起了资本主义国家人民群众不满的浪潮，促使罢工运动日益发展。资本主义国家的劳动人民为了争取他们的基本权利，争取自由和独立，正在坚决地奋起斗争。苏联、中华人民共和国及各人民民主国家的人民是在为自己而不是为资本家工作，他们的成就鼓舞着全世界劳动人民的信心，唤起他们去反对饥饿、贫困和无权地位，为摆脱资本主义的压迫、争取人类光明的未来而斗争。
    什维尔尼克接着详细地谈到工会在发展国民经济的问题和组织社会主义竞赛方面的作用。苏联工会正在领导社会主义竞赛，把群众的努力导向发掘进一步提高劳动生产率的新潜力，以保证完成和超额完成第五个五年计划。在竞赛中，各企业内产生了许许多多的生产革新者和先进生产者干部。至少全国都知道车工比科夫和科列索夫，炼钢工人斯特鲁科夫和卡尔米科夫、高炉领班沙季林、建筑工人西尔科夫、拖拉机队长安格林娜、织工科托娃的名字。
    生产革新者——这是最熟练的、精通技术的工人，他们能够经常不倦地发掘生产潜力，大胆利用技术，并按照新的方法组织自己的劳动。他们是苏维埃社会的先进劳动者，全体工人和职员都应当向他们看齐。工会的任务就是要用一切办法支持一切的经验和创议，使之成为广大工人和职员群众的财产。
    什维尔尼克说，在我们的工业和农业中蕴藏着不断提高劳动生产率的巨大潜力。然而，在许多企业中和国民经济的一些部门中，这种潜力远没有得到充分的利用。虽然我们整个工业的工人劳动生产率在一九四八年就已经达到了或超过了战前的水平，但在采煤工业中，到一九五一年才达到了战前水平，而某些矿场至今仍未达到这一水平。在木材工业和建筑企业中，完成劳动生产率计划的工作也进行得不顺利。
    生产革新者的许多宝贵的创议没有得到广泛的推广。这种情况的造成，常常应由政府各部、企业和工会组织的领导者负责。某些工会工作人员并不是没有批准生产革新者的创议，他们还为此作出决定，口口声声说要予以推广，但是却没有在这方面做任何实际工作。
    各工会首先是全苏工会中央理事会没有领导群众日益高涨的创造积极性，而是在近几年来削弱了对社会主义竞赛的领导，并且没有把推广生产革新者的经验当作它们的生产和群众工作中的主要工作。
    社会主义竞赛——这是活生生的创造性的事业。它是不能容许以形式主义和官僚习气对待的。
    而在许多企业中，工会组织经常以编制各种汇报、资料和报告，编制各式各样的参加竞赛者登记表来代替开展竞赛的组织工作。总结全苏社会主义竞赛时发生了官僚主义的情形。全苏工会中央理事会，各工会中央委员会和有关各部在总结竞赛时，只注意到先进企业，没有研究有些工厂、机器拖拉机站和国营农场落后的原因，没有制订具体措施来将落后的企业提高到先进企业的水平。工厂委员会和地方委员会应竭力争取使全体职工积极参加竞赛，帮助他们达到高度的劳动生产率。
    生产会议在许多企业中已成为对群众进行共产主义教育的真正学校，这是进一步发展工人和工程技术人员的创造主动性的一个重要方法。在生产会议上，职工们批评错误缺点，决定提高劳动生产率的实际步骤。
    必须改进工会在推动工人的发明和合理化建议方面的工作，并尽一切可能巩固在劳动纪律方面的工作。
    全苏工会中央理事会和各工会的中央委员会应当更多地注意调整工资的问题，争取消除职工工资中的平均主义。
    什维尔尼克谈到了各工会参加争取农业高涨的斗争的问题。工会组织在为开垦地区的机器拖拉机站与国营农场的职工的文化和生活福利服务方面实行了很多措施。现在已经展开了争取提高农作物单位面积产量，争取进一步增加牲畜头数及牲畜的产品生产率，争取充分利用拖拉机、联合机及其他农业机器的社会主义竞赛。
    苏联共产党中央委员会一九五三年九月全体会议和今年二—三月全体会议提出了一项任务：要提高农村文化教育机关的工作水平，活跃俱乐部和图书馆的活动，要定期放映电影，进一步在农村使用无线电设备。必须做到这一步，要使每一个机器拖拉机站和国营农场都有红角和流动图书馆。工会组织应该提高对机器拖拉机站和国营农场的经济领导人员的要求，这些领导人员有责任供给房舍来设立红角、俱乐部与图书馆。
    在机器拖拉机站和国营农场的劳动组织方面，在采用高度的工业技术方面，工业企业的职工能够经常给以巨大的帮助。
    什维尔尼克说：关心人民的福利是我们党和政府的最高准则。这种关心鲜明地反映在：工人阶级和农民的物质福利和文化水平的不断提高，消费品的价格有步骤的减低，大规模进行住宅与文化机构的建设。一九五四年住宅建设的投资额比一九五三年增加了百分之三十五，消费品的零售价格现在已比一九四七年低十二分之七。社会保险费年年都在增加，今年是二百四十七亿卢布。自第十届全苏工会代表大会以来，有一千三百万职工享受到了疗养的权利，有一千二百万职工子女曾住过少年先锋营。
    什维尔尼克说，但是我们还有些经济工作者和工会领导者对满足劳动人民的物质与文化生活需要漠不关心。石油工业部和建造部经常不能完成住宅建筑计划，苏联农业部和苏联国营农场部的住宅建筑也进行得不好。
    各业工会中央委员会及工厂和地方工会委员会应当检查住宅、公共宿舍、文化福利机关的建筑工作，检查住宅是否得到正确的分配，检查住宅的修缮工作。
    扩大苏联的贸易和公共食堂，对于提高劳动人民的物质福利具有重大的意义。虽然零售贸易日益发展，公共食堂的状况日益得到改善，但是在这方面仍然存在着严重的缺点。商店里不是经常都有足够的货物，商店不是经常能得到所需的各种品种的货物。还有不少的食堂做不出味道甘美的饭菜。各业工会中央委员会和工会理事会应当保证经常检查商店和食堂的工作，并和违反苏维埃贸易原则的现象进行坚决的斗争，设法改善对居民的服务。
    在我国，国家支出的社会保险费、国民教育费和保健费每年都在增加。一九五四年，这些经费增加到了一千四百一十亿卢布。政府已为钢铁、采煤、伐木、化学和石油工业职工，海上和内河航运、铁路运输业职工以及教师和医务工作者规定了较高的养老金。一九五三年，工人和职员的养老金增加为一九四零年的四倍。疗养院和休养所网在迅速扩大。
    苏联拨出大量款项为职工准备舒适而健康的劳动条件。在谈到的这一时期内已为改善安全设施和工业卫生事业花了九十亿卢布。
    什维尔尼克接着着重指出了工会在对劳动人民进行共产主义教育中的重大作用。一九五三年有七百五十万人读完了免费进修班。工会在党的领导下，在各企业、机关、公共宿舍、俱乐部和图书馆中，进行各种群众文化工作。它们组织演讲会、报告会、与生产革新者的座谈会和文娱晚会，帮助工人提高文化和技术水平。工会所利用的有九千四百二十个俱乐部和文化宫，一万三千多个图书馆，九万七千个职工娱乐站。在俱乐部和娱乐站中活动的业余艺术小组有十二万三千多个。有二百多万工人和职员参加了业余艺术小组。然而，工会文化工作的规模和思想水平仍然不能满足现有的要求。必须克服文化机关中的因循作风和单调呆板的现象，以高度有思想性的内容充实它们的工作，使得它们的工作为大家所欢迎。在报告所涉及的时期内，工会采取了许多办法来加强自愿运动协会，培养了数十万个积极分子——组织者和指导员。在这个时期内，体育组织和运动员的数目增加为两倍多。工会自愿运动协会培养了一百多万熟练的运动员。今天在苏联各项全国纪录和冠军的称号，有一半为工会的运动员所获得。他们创造了十八项世界纪录。
    随后什维尔尼克详细谈到了工会在提高组织工作水平方面的任务。他说：在谈及的五年期间工会会员增加了一千二百万人。各工会组织向第十一届全苏工会代表大会作了报告和进行了选举。在展开批评和自我批评的情况下讨论了各工会委员会的活动。工会会员的发言充满了这种关怀：工会今后仍然是党的战斗的助手，它们在国家的、经济的和文化的建设中所起的作用将不断加强。
    什维尔尼克强调说，全苏工会中央理事会、各工会中央委员会和各工会理事会应当坚决改进干部工作，加强与群众的联系。在全苏工会中央理事会和中央、共和国、边疆区与州的各工会委员会和工会理事会的工作中，还没有根除文牍主义和官僚主义的作风。全苏工会中央理事会的各部门和管理处与各工会组织之间的联系很差，而且很少帮助它们消灭缺点。
    随后，什维尔尼克谈到了苏联工会参加为加强国际工人团结，为和平与民主而斗争的问题。苏联各工会忠实于无产阶级国际主义的原则，和各国的工人阶级与工会建立起牢固的友好关系与密切合作。各人民民主国家的工会代表和资本主义国家及殖民地附属国的工会代表参加第十一届全苏工会代表大会，显著地证明：劳动人民的兄弟友谊和国际劳动团结日益巩固加强。
    一九四九年，来苏联访问的有来自六十二个国家的四百六十三个外国工人代表团。在同一时期，有二百六十九个苏联工会代表团应其他国家工会的邀请到世界各国去访问。
    什维尔尼克同志说道：我们今天可以十分满意地说，我们与伟大的中华人民共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古人民共和国、德意志民主共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的劳动人民有着牢不可破的兄弟友谊与牢固的联系。苏联工会与资本主义国家和殖民地国家的工人阶级和工会组织的联系已加强了，并且变得更为密切了。
    苏联工会和各国劳动人民团结在世界工会联合会里，世界工会联合会鲜明地体现了国际工会组织在争取美好的生活、争取工人阶级的民主权利和自由、争取世界和平的斗争中的团结一致。苏联工会今后将继续和其他国家的劳动人民肩并肩地保卫伟大的和平事业，努力在争取劳动人类的美好将来的斗争中取得胜利。
    什维尔尼克在结束他的报告时着重指出，工会在教育劳动人民成为积极的、忠于祖国的、共产主义社会的建设者的工作中，是共产党的忠实的助手和可靠的支柱。在争取继续繁荣社会主义祖国，争取不断提高人民的物质福利和文化水平的斗争中，工会要更加紧密地把劳动人民团结在苏联共产党的周围。　　　（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科讯）
