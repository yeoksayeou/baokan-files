The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and the leaders of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League have each made statements expressing their full support for the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China, and calling on workers, women, and youth across the country to seriously study and discuss it.

The responsible person of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said: The draft constitution of the People's Republic of China has been promulgated by the Central People's Government Committee. This is an extremely important political event for the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country.

Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country, after a long period of arduous struggle, overthrew the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism, and established the People's Republic of China led by the working class, thus making it possible to formulate such a people's constitution.

This draft constitution embodies the will of the people of the whole country, records the actual situation of our country, reflects the great victory of our people's revolution and the great changes in social relations that have emerged since the founding of the country, summarizes the main experiences of these changes, clearly stipulates the general tasks of the country during the transition period, reflects the common aspirations of the broad masses of the people to build a new socialist life, and points out the long-term goal of gradually eliminating the phenomenon of exploitation of man by man and establishing a socialist society.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions fully supports the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China. It calls on the broad masses of workers and staff to enthusiastically展开 [zhǎn kāi - launch] discussions and strive with practical actions to complete or overfulfill the state's production plan.

The responsible person of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation said: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation, representing women across the country, warmly supports the draft constitution. Its entire content fully represents the wishes and interests of the people of the whole country and the women of the whole country. It affirms the great victory of our people's democratic revolution and also affirms the new political and economic achievements of our country since its founding. It also reflects the demands of the broad masses of the people to build a socialist society and puts forward concrete guarantees. The era in which Chinese working women were oppressed and discriminated against for thousands of years has ended, and a new era in which Chinese women and men truly enjoy complete equality has begun.

The draft constitution not only generally represents the common interests of the people of the whole country and the women of the whole country, but also makes special provisions based on the special situation of Chinese women: "Women in the People's Republic of China enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social and family life." "Marriage, family, mother and child are protected by the state." It also stipulates: "Women have equal rights with men to vote and stand for election." These provisions profoundly embody the state's meticulous care for women, families, mothers, and children. Our country will guarantee that women enjoy full equality with men through all aspects of work, such as political, economic, cultural, and educational. We call on women across the country to seriously study the draft constitution, enthusiastically participate in discussions, put forward their opinions on the draft constitution, and, after the constitution is formally promulgated, consciously strive to abide by the constitution and defend the constitution!

The responsible person of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League said: The Chinese New Democratic Youth League warmly supports the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China promulgated by the Central People's Government Committee.

The fact that the Chinese people can formulate their own national law for the first time is the result of the long and heroic struggle of the Chinese people, especially the heroic struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, which has achieved brilliant victories. Chinese youth can enjoy this great victory together with the people of the whole country, and first of all, they must wholeheartedly thank the great Chinese Communist Party and the great Chairman Mao.

The draft constitution of the People's Republic of China not only summarizes the achievements of our people's revolution, but also clearly and definitively plans the road to building our country into a great socialist country, and arranges a happier world for our people and youth. Chinese youth will therefore be greatly encouraged.

Members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League must unite the youth of the whole country well, launch a wave of studying and discussing the draft constitution, and in the course of studying and discussing, fully recognize the special care of the state for the younger generation, the sacred rights and obligations that the state has given us youth, thereby further improving our socialist consciousness, carrying forward the glorious tradition of patriotism of being loyal to the people and working hard, and completing the tasks given to us by the state with a high degree of initiative, creativity, and discipline, and training ourselves to become heroic fighters in building a socialist society.

   【本报讯】中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会和中国新民主主义青年团的负责人分别发表谈话，表示完全拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案，并号召全国职工、妇女和青年认真学习和讨论。
    中华全国总工会负责人的谈话说：中华人民共和国宪法草案，已经中央人民政府委员会公布了。这是中国工人阶级和全国人民的一件极其重大的政治事件。
    中国工人阶级和全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，经过了长期的艰苦奋斗，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治，建立了以工人阶级为领导的中华人民共和国，因而才有可能制定这样一个人民的宪法。
    这个宪法草案，体现着全国人民的意志，记录了我们国家的现实情况，反映了我国人民革命的伟大胜利和建国以来所出现的社会关系的伟大变革，总结了这些变革的主要经验，明确规定了国家在过渡时期的总任务，反映了广大人民建设社会主义新生活的共同愿望，指出了逐步消灭人剥削人的现象和建立社会主义社会的远大目标。
    中华全国总工会完全拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案。号召全国广大职工群众热烈地展开讨论，并以实际的行动为完成或超额完成国家生产计划而奋斗。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会负责人的谈话说：中华全国民主妇女联合会代表全国妇女热烈拥护宪法草案。它的全部内容充分代表了全国人民、全国妇女的愿望和利益。它肯定了我国人民民主革命的伟大胜利成果，也肯定了我国建国以来政治上、经济上的新成就。它也反映了广大人民建设社会主义社会的要求，并提出了具体的保证。几千年来中国劳动妇女被压迫被歧视的时代已经结束，中国妇女和男子真正处于完全平等地位的新时代已经开始。
    宪法草案不仅一般地代表了全国人民和全国妇女的共同利益，而且还根据中国妇女所处的特殊情况，作了特别的规定：“中华人民共和国妇女在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭的生活各方面享有同男子平等的权利。”“婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童受国家的保护。”还规定了：“妇女有同男子平等的选举权和被选举权。”这些条文，深刻地体现了国家对妇女、家庭、母亲与儿童无微不至的关怀。我们的国家将通过政治、经济、文化教育等一切方面的工作，保证妇女享有同男子完全平等的权利。我们号召全国妇女认真学习宪法草案，热烈参加讨论，提出自己对宪法草案的意见，并在宪法正式公布以后，自觉地为遵守宪法、保卫宪法而斗争！
    中国新民主主义青年团负责人的谈话说：中国新民主主义青年团热烈拥护中央人民政府委员会公布的中华人民共和国宪法草案。
    中国人民能够第一次制定自己的国家大法，是由于中国人民长期英勇奋斗，特别是在中国共产党和毛主席领导下英勇奋斗所获得辉煌胜利的结果。中国青年能够和全国人民一道享受到这个伟大的胜利果实，首先要衷心地感谢伟大的中国共产党和伟大的毛主席。
    中华人民共和国宪法草案，不仅总结了我国人民革命的成果，而且清楚明确地规划了把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家的道路，为我国人民和青年安排了一个更幸福的天地。中国青年将因此受到莫大的鼓舞。
    中国新民主主义青年团团员一定要很好地团结全国青年，掀起一个学习和讨论宪法草案的热潮，在学习和讨论中，要充分认识到国家对青年一代的特别关怀，国家所赋予我们青年的神圣的权利和义务，从而更进一步地提高我们的社会主义觉悟，发扬忠于人民、艰苦奋斗的爱国主义的光荣传统，以高度的积极性创造性纪律性来完成国家所给予自己的任务，把自己锻炼成为建设社会主义社会的英勇战士。
