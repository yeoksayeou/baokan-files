    Decision of the Central People's Government on Abolishing the Greater Administrative Regions and Merging Several Provinces and Municipalities
    (Adopted at the 32nd Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on June 19, 1954)
    1. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the greater administrative regions, representing the Central People's Government in leading and supervising local governments, have played a very important role in implementing the central policies, carrying out people's democratic construction, conducting various social reform movements, restoring the national economy, and in economic construction, cultural construction, and other aspects of work. They have successfully completed their tasks.
    2. Now, the country has entered a period of planned economic construction. The construction of the national planned economy requires further strengthening of the centralized and unified leadership of the central government. In order for the central government to directly lead the provinces and municipalities so as to better and more effectively understand the situation at the lower levels, reduce organizational layers, increase work efficiency, and overcome bureaucracy; in order to save cadres to strengthen the needs of the central government and supply factories and mines, and to appropriately strengthen the leadership of provinces and municipalities, it is entirely necessary and timely to abolish the greater administrative regions.
    3. In view of the current situation where the greater administrative regions undertake many specific tasks for the central government, and the central departments are not very familiar with the situation of the provinces and municipalities, in order to avoid the confusion of leadership interruption during the process of abolishing the greater administrative regions, the central government, the greater administrative regions, and the provinces and municipalities must make full preparations, and the handover work between each other must be done very steadily. In terms of steps, it is not necessary to adopt the method of abolishing the six greater administrative regions at once, but to adopt the method of abolishing them one by one. For different departments, they can be abolished one by one according to the principle of easy first and difficult later, simple first and complex later, according to different natures. As for the time and order of abolishing the greater administrative regions, and the order and steps of abolishing the various departments, it shall be arranged and stipulated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government.
    4. After the abolition of the greater administrative regions, in order to facilitate the central government's leadership over the provinces and municipalities, especially in order to meet the requirements of national economic construction, it is very necessary to merge some provinces and municipalities and reduce some administrative units directly led by the central government. Therefore, it is decided that:
    1.  The administrative divisions of Liaodong and Liaoxi provinces shall be abolished and merged into Liaoning Province.
    2.  The administrative division of Songjiang Province shall be abolished and merged with Heilongjiang Province to form Heilongjiang Province.
    3.  The administrative division of Ningxia Province shall be abolished and merged with Gansu Province to form Gansu Province.
    4.  The eleven municipalities directly under the central government, namely Shenyang, Lüda, Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Harbin, Changchun, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and Chongqing, shall all be changed to municipalities under the jurisdiction of provinces. Shenyang, Lüda, Anshan, Fushun, and Benxi shall be incorporated into the administrative division of Liaoning Province; Harbin shall be incorporated into the administrative division of Heilongjiang Province; Changchun shall be incorporated into the administrative division of Jilin Province; Wuhan shall be incorporated into the administrative division of Hubei Province; Guangzhou shall be incorporated into the administrative division of Guangdong Province; Xi'an shall be incorporated into the administrative division of Shaanxi Province; Chongqing shall be incorporated into the administrative division of Sichuan Province.
    The time and merger work of the above-mentioned provinces and municipalities shall also be arranged and stipulated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government.

    中央人民政府关于撤销大区一级行政机构和合并若干省、市建制的决定
    （一九五四年六月十九日中央人民政府委员会第三十二次会议通过）
    一、自中华人民共和国成立以来，大区一级行政机构代表中央人民政府领导和监督地方政府，对于贯彻中央政策，实施人民民主建政工作，进行各种社会改革运动，恢复国民经济，以及在经济建设、文化建设和其他各方面的工作中，都起着很重要的作用，都胜利地完成了它的任务。
    二、现在，国家进入了有计划的经济建设的时期。国家计划经济的建设，要求进一步加强中央集中统一的领导。为了中央直接领导省市以便于更能切实地了解下面的情况，减少组织层次，增加工作效率，克服官僚主义；为了节约干部加强中央和供给厂矿企业的需要，并适当地加强省、市的领导，撤销大区一级的行政机构，是完全必要的和适时的。
    三、鉴于目前各大区一级行政机构为中央担负了许多具体的工作，而中央各部门对于各省市的情形又不很熟悉的实际情况，为了在撤销大区一级机构的过程中，不致发生领导中断的混乱状态，中央、大区和省市三级都要进行充分的准备，相互间的交接工作，必须做得非常稳当。在步骤上，可以不必采取六个大区机构一次撤销的办法，而采取一个一个地撤销的办法。对于各个不同的部门，可视不同性质，按照先易后难、先简后繁的原则逐个地加以撤销。至于各个大区一级机构撤销的时间和先后，各个部门撤销的次序和步骤，应由中央人民政府政务院加以安排和规定。
    四、在大区一级机构撤销之后，为了便利于中央对于省、市的领导，特别是为了适应国家经济建设的要求，合并一些省市，减少一些中央直接领导的行政单位，是很必要的。为此决定：
    1、辽东、辽西两个省的建制均撤销，合并改为辽宁省。
    2、松江省建制撤销，与黑龙江省合并为黑龙江省。
    3、宁夏省建制撤销，与甘肃省合并为甘肃省。
    4、沈阳、旅大、鞍山、抚顺、本溪、哈尔滨、长春、武汉、广州、西安、重庆等十一个中央直辖市，均改为省辖市。沈阳、旅大、鞍山、抚顺、本溪五市并入辽宁省的建制；哈尔滨市并入黑龙江省的建制；长春市并入吉林省的建制；武汉市并入湖北省的建制；广州市并入广东省的建制；西安市并入陕西省的建制；重庆市并入四川省的建制。
    以上省市的合并时间和合并工作，亦应由中央人民政府政务院加以安排和规定。
