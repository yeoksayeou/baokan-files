Northeast China is actively carrying out livestock breeding. Currently, the 115 artificial insemination stations in the seven key fine breed horse promotion counties of Nong'an, Dehui, Shuangcheng, etc., have inseminated over 17,000 mares, completing 56% of the planned breeding tasks. Among them, Nong'an County has completed 72% of the task. The 850 private horse breeding stations in the 24 counties of Liaoxi Province, including Changtu, Lishu, and Faku, have bred more than 20,000 mares, the number of breeding accounting for about 40% of the total number of breedable mares in the province. The province's breeding rate has increased by 15% compared with the same period last year; more than 1,100 private donkey breeding stations (breeding mules) have bred more than 13,000 jennies. In some areas of five counties in Heilongjiang Province, including Longjiang, Lindian, and Yian, more than 17,000 mares have been bred; incomplete statistics from 16 counties in Jilin Province, including Qian'an, Yongji, and Jiutai, show that about 9,500 mares have been bred.

Agricultural producers' cooperatives in various places have played a positive leading role in livestock breeding. For example, the mares in Minxing and Yanxing in Yanshou County, Changle in Anguang County, Xinghua in Yongji County, and many other agricultural producers' cooperatives have all been bred, except for those that have not yet foaled. More than 50% of the mares in key breeding counties such as Longjiang, Changtu, Qian'an, and Faku have been bred, and all breeding has been carried out in an organized manner. In the fifth district of Panshan County, 93% of the mares have been bred.

This year's breeding work has been strengthened due to the enhanced organizational leadership in various places and the increased awareness of livestock breeding among the masses of farmers. Generally, the work started early, progressed quickly, and was carried out more extensively. In many areas, the number of livestock bred far exceeded the number in the same period last year, and most of the breeding was carried out in an organized manner, reducing the phenomenon of cross-breeding and random breeding.

    东北各地积极进行牲畜配种工作
    东北各地正积极进行牲畜配种。目前，农安、德惠、双城等七个优良种马推广县的一百一十五处人工授精站，已配母马一万七千余匹，完成计划配种任务的百分之五十六，其中农安县已完成任务的百分之七十二。辽西省昌图、梨树、法库等二十四个县的八百五十处民间配马站，已配马二万多匹，配种数目约为全省可繁殖母马的百分之四十左右，全省配种率比去年同一时期提高百分之十五；一千一百多处民间种马配驴站（繁殖驴骡）已配母驴一万三千余匹。黑龙江省龙江、林甸、依安等五个县部分地区已配马一万七千多匹；吉林省乾安、永吉、九台等十六个县不完全统计已配母马九千五百匹左右。
    各地农业生产合作社在牲畜配种工作中起了积极带头作用，如延寿县民兴、延兴，安广县长乐，永吉县兴华以及其他好多农业生产合作社的母马，除尚未产驹的以外已全部配种。龙江、昌图、乾安、法库等繁殖重点县的母马已配完百分之五十以上，并且都做到了有组织的配种，盘山县第五区的母马已配完百分之九十三。
    今年配种工作由于各地加强了组织领导以及农民群众对繁殖牲畜认识的提高，一般是动手早，行动快，开展较为普遍，许多地区牲畜配种头数远远超过去年同一时期的数目，而大部做到了有组织的配种，减少了杂交乱配现象。
