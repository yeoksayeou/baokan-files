　　After the Discussion of the Korean Question Ended
　　By our correspondent Li Zhuang

　　The discussion on the Korean question at the Geneva Conference has ended, but the Korean question, which concerns the peace of the Far East and the world, remains on the agenda of international affairs and awaits further peaceful resolution through consultation.

　　When Foreign Minister Nam Il left Geneva, he issued a statement at the airport, reiterating the determination of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to strive for a unified, independent, and democratic Korea through peaceful means. This statement expresses the common belief and desire of the peace-loving Korean people and the people of the world.

　　The Korean question was originally one of the major issues in international relations after World War II. The 1945 Moscow Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom agreed to assist the Korean people, based on democratic principles, to establish an independent, unified, and democratic Korea through consultation. However, in subsequent actions, the U.S. authorities unilaterally undermined this solemn international agreement, attempting to turn the entire Korean Peninsula into its colony and military base by force. The three-year Korean War showed that the U.S.'s policy of strength did not succeed, and the Korean War ended with the bankruptcy of the U.S.'s plan to resolve the issue by force. The armistice in Korea once again presented the possibility of peacefully resolving the Korean question, and the convening of the Geneva Conference provided an opportunity to turn this possibility into reality.

　　The Korean people and the people of the world had expected the Geneva Conference to bring lasting peace to the Korean people and provide them with favorable conditions for unifying their country and gaining independence through peaceful means. The Geneva Conference did not complete its task in this regard, but the fifty-one days of discussion were not in vain, and the crux of the Korean question and the path to its rational resolution have been revealed.

　　In order to satisfy the aspirations of the Korean people and the people of the world, the delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union have made continuous and constructive maximum efforts at the Geneva Conference. Foreign Minister Nam Il proposed a suggestion on holding all-Korea elections to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea at the beginning of the conference. The fairness and rationality of the many principles for peacefully resolving the Korean question included in this suggestion were such that even representatives of many Western countries could not categorically oppose them. Although many differences emerged during the discussion of this suggestion at the conference, there were also many common points. In order to promote the progress of the conference, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai put forward a supplementary suggestion to Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal on May 22, advocating that neutral countries assist and supervise the all-Korea elections. Foreign Minister Molotov then proposed five principles on June 5, which many delegations agreed upon in the discussion, suggesting that the conference first reach an agreement on these principles, and then further consider specific ways to implement these principles to eliminate the remaining differences. The delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union came to Geneva with the sincerity of seeking to reach an agreement. Their consistent efforts to resolve the Korean issue through peaceful consultation have won praise from all fair-minded public opinion.

　　However, not all delegations participating in the Geneva Conference held the same sincerity and aspirations. From the very beginning of the conference, the U.S. delegation showed that it did not come to Geneva to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, but to obstruct its resolution. The U.S. delegation's course of action was to prove in Geneva that a peaceful resolution of the Korean question was impossible. In this way, the United States could continue to maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice and support the Syngman Rhee group to launch another war to unify the entire Korean Peninsula by force when the opportunity arose. The most obvious fact that the United States had no sincerity in reaching an agreement on the Korean issue in Geneva was that the U.S. delegation did not put forward any suggestions from beginning to end, and swiftly rejected all the suggestions of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union without consideration. The reason why the U.S. delegation instigated Byun Young-tae to put forward the so-called "fourteen-point proposal" was because it clearly knew that this proposal would never be accepted. The lack of enthusiasm of some Western delegations for this rigid policy of the United States, and the slightest hint of hesitation and compromise, were met with accusations and curses from the United States.

　　In a situation where the peaceful reunification of Korea could not be resolved due to U.S. obstruction, the delegations of Korea, the Soviet Union, and China made final efforts in Geneva based on their consistent policies to consolidate and strengthen the existing peaceful situation in Korea. At the final meeting on June 15, Foreign Minister Nam Il again put forward a plan to guarantee the peaceful conditions in Korea, and Foreign Minister Molotov also proposed a declaration on the Korean issue in which the participating countries jointly guarantee peace in Korea. When these suggestions were again rejected by the United States, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai finally proposed that efforts should be continued at an appropriate time in the future to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This suggestion had such great moral force and persuasiveness to world opinion that the British and Belgian representatives also expressed their approval, and the delegations of some other Western countries did not dare to oppose it. However, at the last moment when this suggestion was about to be unanimously adopted by the conference, the U.S. representative Smith came out and opposed it regardless of everything. The discussion on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference finally did not reach any agreement.

　　The failure of the Geneva Conference to reach any agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is not the fault of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union. People can clearly see from the entire course of the conference that the United States and its followers bear full responsibility for this. Many opinions in Asia and Europe have already expressed their views on this issue.

　　India's "Navajivan" wrote: "... In the Korean issue negotiations, the Communists put forward a suggestion to hold elections under the supervision of a neutral country committee, thereby opening the door for an agreement. However, due to the opposition of the United States and South Korea, this suggestion did not produce any good results..."

　　Switzerland's "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" wrote on June 18:
  "On the second day of the Korean Conference, the North Koreans put forward a proposal to the conference advocating free elections, and Zhou Enlai supplemented this proposal, declaring the establishment of a neutral supervisory committee. An agreement could have been reached on this basis, but the Western countries insisted on the United Nations supervising the elections, and the conference failed here. For North Korea, the United Nations is an army, that is, the enemy. It is completely reasonable for them to oppose this army supervising the elections."

　　France's "Le Monde" also said on the same day that since North Korea had proposed that the seats in the future unified parliament be elected in proportion to the population, there was no reason for the United States to oppose a joint all-Korea committee composed of equal representatives from North and South Korea. The newspaper criticized the unreasonable demands of the United States on the issue of withdrawing foreign troops, saying: "Demanding that American troops remain in South Korea, while requiring the Chinese People's Volunteers to withdraw one month before the elections, is clearly unacceptable to China and North Korea."

　　Even the pro-American French bourgeois newspaper "Le Figaro" published an article on June 17 accusing the United States of breaking up the conference by "rude" means. The newspaper said: "As is well known, despite the new proposals put forward by North Korea and China, and these proposals were not considered, the Korean issue came to an end."

　　From these opinions, it can be concluded that although the Geneva Conference did not reach any agreement on the discussion of the Korean issue, it showed the world who sincerely advocates peace, and who opposes peace; who sincerely advocates consultation, and who refuses consultation; who truly advocates the establishment of an independent, unified, and democratic Korea, and who advocates the establishment of a colonial, divided, Syngman Rhee-style Korea. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union's just and reasonable proposals for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the spirit of genuinely seeking an agreement at the Geneva Conference have won the praise of all fair-minded public opinion in the world and achieved a major political and moral victory. The unreasonable demands of the United States and its attitude of refusing to reach any agreement were completely exposed, condemned by world opinion, and suffered a serious political and moral failure.

　　The U.S. authorities' crude breakup of the Korean negotiations was so unpopular that almost all Western European newspapers intentionally published this news in a very unimportant position to keep their readers from paying attention to this matter. American newspapers were also not in the mood to publicize the so-called "American victory." Even some senior officials of Western delegations privately explained the difficulties of their situation to people after the meeting. They also stated that the Korean issue has not been settled, and it is impossible to truly resolve the Korean issue without the participation of China.

　　The fact is obvious that the Korean issue does not cease to exist with the end of the Geneva Conference's discussion of the Korean issue. Immediately after the conference ended, South Korean representative Byun Young-tae clamored that he was not bound by the armistice agreement and would unify the entire Korean Peninsula by force. This shows that the unstable state of the Korean armistice only conforms to the interests of those who try to maintain international tensions and conspire to launch new wars again, and violates the interests of consolidating peace and security in the Far East and the world, and also violates the interests of the people of all countries who have children fighting in Korea. The interests of the Korean people and the people of the world lie in continuing to work towards establishing an independent, unified, and democratic Korea through peaceful consultation. The U.S.'s policy of turning Korea into its colony by means of war has not only been proven to be a complete failure by the three-year Korean War in the past, but it will also inevitably be unworkable in the future.

　　Although the Geneva Conference did not reach an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, it showed that the practice of imposing one's own opinions on others is unworkable. Only peaceful consultation is the fairest, most reasonable, and realistic way to resolve the Korean issue. In fact, there were many common points of view among the parties during the conference discussions, that is to say, there was a basis for reaching an agreement. If it were not for the U.S. authorities' insistence on imposing their own opinions on others, the Geneva Conference could have reached an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. At the same time, despite the fact that the U.S. authorities exerted strong pressure on their allies, forcing them to submit to U.S. policies, the deepening of divisions within the Western bloc is an undeniable fact. It can be predicted that with the greater strength of the world's forces for peace and democracy, with the further development of the diplomatic activities of peaceful and democratic countries, and with the more intense intensification of the insurmountable contradictions within the imperialist camp, more favorable conditions will emerge for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The various proposals put forward by Korea, China, and the Soviet Union at the Geneva Conference have provided a reasonable consultative basis for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Korea, China, and the Soviet Union have reiterated that they have full confidence in continuing to strive unremittingly for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and for the establishment of an independent, unified, and democratic Korea.

### 朝鲜问题的讨论结束之后

    朝鲜问题的讨论结束之后
    本报记者　李庄
    日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论已告结束，但是关系远东和世界和平的朝鲜问题仍然留在国际事务的议程上，有待于继续通过协商途径来获得和平解决。
    南日外务相在离开日内瓦的时候，在机场发表声明，重申朝鲜民主主义人民共和国坚持经过和平的途径，为统一、独立和民主的朝鲜而奋斗的决心。这一声明，道出了爱好和平的朝鲜人民和全世界人民的共同的信念和愿望。
    朝鲜问题原是第二次世界大战后国际关系中重大的问题之一。一九四五年的苏、美、英三国外长莫斯科会议，曾协议依据民主的原则，协助朝鲜人民经过协商的途径，建立一个独立、统一、民主的朝鲜。但是美国当局在此后的行动中，片面地破坏了这个庄严的国际协议，企图用武力把全朝鲜变为它的殖民地和屯兵场。三年的朝鲜战争表明，美国的实力政策并没有得到成功，朝鲜战争以美国武力解决的计划的破产而宣告结束。朝鲜的停战再度出现了和平解决朝鲜问题的可能性，日内瓦会议的召开提供了使这种可能性成为现实的一个机会。
    朝鲜人民和全世界人民曾期待日内瓦会议为朝鲜人民带来稳固的和平，给他们提供用和平方法统一他们的国家并获得独立的有利条件。日内瓦会议在这方面没有完成它的任务，但是五十一天的讨论并没有白白过去，朝鲜问题的症结及其合理解决的途径已经展现出来了。
    为了满足朝鲜人民和世界人民的愿望，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联的代表团，在日内瓦会议上不断地作了建设性的最大努力。南日外务相在会议一开始就提出了关于举行全朝鲜选举以实现朝鲜的和平统一的建议，这个建议中所包括的和平解决朝鲜问题的许多原则，其公正和合理，甚至连许多西方国家的代表也不能断然反对。会议在讨论这个建议的过程中，虽然出现了许多分歧，但也存在不少共同之点。为了谋求会议的进展，周恩来外长于五月二十二日对南日外务相的建议提出了一个补充建议，主张由中立国协助和监察全朝鲜的选举。莫洛托夫外长又于六月五日提出了在讨论中许多代表团都同意的五项原则，建议会议先就此达成协议，然后再进一步具体考虑实现这些原则的办法，消除尚存的分歧。朝、中、苏代表团是怀着寻求达成协议的诚意来到日内瓦的。他们为和平协商解决朝鲜问题的一贯努力，博得了所有公正舆论的赞扬。
    但是，并不是参加日内瓦会议的所有代表团都抱有同样的诚意和愿望。美国代表团从会议一开始就表现它到日内瓦来并不是要和平解决朝鲜问题，而是要阻挠这个问题的解决。美国代表团的行动路线，是要在日内瓦证明和平解决朝鲜问题是不可能的。这样，美国就可以继续保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，支持李承晚集团在时机到来时再发动一次武力统一全朝鲜的战争。美国丝毫没有在日内瓦达成朝鲜问题协议的诚意，最明显的事实是美国代表团自始至终没有提出任何一个建议，而对于朝、中、苏的所有建议都毫不考虑地迅速加以拒绝。美国代表团之所以唆使卞荣泰提出所谓“十四点建议”，是因为它明白知道这个建议是绝不会被接受的。某些西方国家代表团对于美国这种僵硬政策缺乏热情，以及他们稍微流露一点点犹豫和妥协倾向，都受到来自美国方面的指责和咒骂。
    在朝鲜的和平统一由于美国的阻挠而无法获得解决的情况下，为了巩固和加强朝鲜目前存在的和平局面，朝、苏、中代表团本着它们一贯的政策，在日内瓦作最后的努力。南日外务相在六月十五日最后一次会议上又提出了关于保证朝鲜的和平条件的方案，莫洛托夫外长也提出了一项与会各国共同保证朝鲜和平的关于朝鲜问题的宣言。当这些建议又都被美国拒绝之后，周恩来外长最后还提议在将来适当时机继续努力，以谋求和平解决朝鲜问题。这个建议具有如此巨大的道义力量和对世界舆论的说服力，以致英国和比利时代表也表示赞同，而其他一些西方国家的代表团也不敢加以反对。但是在这个建议将被会议一致通过的最后一刻，美国代表史密斯竟然不顾一切地出来加以反对。日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论终于没有达成任何协议。
    日内瓦会议没有达成关于和平解决朝鲜问题的任何协议，这并不是朝、中、苏方面的过错。人们从会议的全部进程可以清楚地看到，美国及其追随者要对此负完全的责任。亚洲和欧洲的许多舆论已经在这个问题上表明了它们的看法。
    印度的“那弗吉万报”写道：“……在朝鲜问题谈判中，共产党提出在中立国委员会监督下举行选举的建议，从而为协议打开了大门。然而，由于美国和南朝鲜的反对，这个建议没有产生任何良好的结果……。”
    瑞士的“新苏黎士新闻”在六月十八日写道：
  “在朝鲜会议第二天，北朝鲜人向会议提出一项建议，主张举行自由的选举以后，周恩来又补充这一建议，宣称成立一个中立的监察委员会，按照这一基础本来可以取得协议，但西方国家却坚持由联合国监督选举，会议就失败在这里。对北朝鲜来说，联合国是一支军队，就是敌人。他们反对由这支军队来监督选举，是完全合理的。”
    法国“世界报”在同一天也说：北朝鲜既已提出未来的统一的议会的席位按人口比例选举，因此美国反对全朝鲜委员会由南北朝鲜以同等代表组成是没有任何道理的。该报抨击美国在撤退外国军队问题上的无理主张说：“要求在南朝鲜保留美国军队，而要中国人民志愿军在选举前一个月撤退，显然是不能被中朝接受的。”
    甚至一向亲美的法国资产阶级报纸“费加罗报”，也在六月十七日刊载了一篇文章指责美国用
  “粗野的”手段破裂会议。该报说：“如所周知，尽管北朝鲜和中国提出了新建议，而且这些建议也未被考虑，朝鲜问题就告结束。”
    从这些舆论中可以得出这样的结论：日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论虽然没有达成任何协议，但是它向全世界表明是谁真心主张和平，是谁反对和平；是谁真心主张协商，是谁拒绝协商；是谁真正主张建立一个独立、统一、民主的朝鲜，是谁主张建立一个殖民地的分裂的李承晚式的朝鲜。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联在日内瓦会议的公正合理的和平解决朝鲜问题的主张和真正谋求协议的精神，博得了世界所有公正舆论的赞许，赢得了政治上和道义上的重大胜利。而美国的无理主张和拒绝达成任何协议的态度，则完全暴露无遗，受到了世界舆论的谴责，在政治上和道义上遭到严重的失败。
    美国当局粗暴地破裂朝鲜谈判是如此不得人心，以至几乎西欧所有报纸都有意地把这条新闻刊登在很不重要的地位，使他们的读者不注意这件事情。美国的报纸也没有心情去宣传所谓“美国的胜利”。甚至连某些西方国家代表团的高级官员，也在会后私下向人解释自己处境的困难。他们还表示，朝鲜问题并未了结，要真正解决朝鲜问题，排除中国参加是不可能的。
    事实很明显，朝鲜问题并没有因日内瓦会议讨论朝鲜问题的结束而不存在。会议刚刚结束后，南朝鲜代表卞荣泰就叫嚣不受停战协定的约束，要用武力统一全朝鲜。这说明朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，只符合那些力图保持国际紧张局势并阴谋再次发动新的战争的人们的利益，而违反巩固远东和世界和平与安全的利益，也违反那些有子弟在朝鲜作战的各国人民的利益。朝鲜人民和全世界人民的利益，在于继续努力以期用和平协商的方式建立一个独立、统一、民主的朝鲜。美国的用战争办法把朝鲜变为其殖民地的政策，不仅在过去已经为三年的朝鲜战争证明完全失败了，而且在将来也必然是行不通的。
    日内瓦会议虽然没有在和平解决朝鲜问题上达成协议，但它表明那种以自己意见强加在别人身上的作法是行不通的。只有和平协商是解决朝鲜问题的最公平合理和现实的办法。事实上，在会议讨论过程中，各方意见也存在不少共同之点，也就是说存在达成协议的基础。如果不是美国当局的执意坚持其以自己意见强加在别人身上的作法，日内瓦会议完全可以达成有关和平解决朝鲜问题的协议。同时尽管美国当局对其盟国施加强大的压力，迫使他们屈从美国的政策，但西方集团内部分歧的深刻化却是无可否认的事实。可以预料，随着世界和平民主力量的更加壮大，随着和平民主国家外交活动的进一步开展，随着帝国主义阵营内部无法克服的矛盾更加激烈化，将出现和平解决朝鲜问题的更加有利的条件。朝、中、苏三国在日内瓦会议上提出的各项建议，已为朝鲜问题的和平解决提供了合理的协商基础。朝、中、苏三国已重申他们有充分的信心，继续为和平解决朝鲜问题，为建立一个独立、统一、民主的朝鲜而奋斗不懈。
