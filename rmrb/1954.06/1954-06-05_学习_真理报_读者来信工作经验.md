Learning from "Pravda's" Experience in Handling Readers' Letters
Xu Dui

    "Pravda" receives more letters every year. In 1948, it received 198,000 letters (including submissions, collectively referred to as letters, same below), which increased to 400,000 last year. This shows that on the one hand, the Soviet people have a high degree of political consciousness, and they actively express their will to the Party and the people of the whole country through "Pravda," constantly writing to "Pravda" about their opinions on work, life requirements, and their achievements and inner joy in building communism; on the other hand, it also shows that "Pravda" attaches great importance to the work of handling letters from laborers, gaining the unlimited trust and love of the Soviet people, and thus uniting an increasing number of masses around the newspaper.

    How does the "Pravda" editorial department attach importance to the work of handling letters from laborers? It can be answered in one sentence: They handle laborers' letters with a high sense of responsibility to the Soviet people and the Party. This can be illustrated by the following specific examples:

    On December 18th last year, "Pravda," in an article titled "Conservatism and Stagnation on the Road of Production Innovators," sharply criticized the Deputy Minister of the Soviet Ministry of Construction Materials Industry and the leaders of the Technical Management Department for their mistakes of delaying and treating rationalization proposals with a bureaucratic attitude. This article was written after investigating materials reflected in a letter. Originally, an advanced producer wrote a letter to the "Pravda" editorial department, saying that a new proposal of his had been suppressed by the Ministry of Construction Materials Industry and had not been implemented for a long time. In order to support the new proposal of the advanced producer, the "Pravda" editorial department decided to send a reporter from the newspaper's Industrial Transportation and Trade Department, and invited an engineer to go to the Ministry of Construction Materials Industry for investigation. They spent a week examining the ministry's resolutions and instructions on adopting new proposals over the years, and found that although the ministry had issued many instructions for promoting new proposals from the masses, few had been implemented because the work of supervising the implementation of instructions was not done well. In order to solve this specific problem raised in the masses' letter, they talked with people in the ministry who supported the new proposal to understand the reasons why the proposal had not been implemented; they also talked with people who opposed the new proposal, including Communist Party members and leaders; and also interviewed the minister. They found that the reason why this new proposal had not been implemented was that the person in charge of adopting the proposal did not believe in the wisdom of the masses and had serious conservative ideas, and the Deputy Minister had not paid attention to this matter either.

    After the article was published, the Ministry of Construction Materials Industry held a special ministerial meeting on this issue. The meeting also invited advanced producers and relevant parties to participate, giving them full opportunity to speak. The meeting also decided to dismiss the Deputy Director of the Technical Management Department who was directly responsible for this matter, and give warnings to other relevant people. The various departments of the ministry convened Party meetings, strictly criticizing conservative ideas. This article also attracted the attention of other industrial departments.

    We can be greatly educated by the "Pravda" editorial department's handling of this letter. The "Pravda" editorial department immediately sent people to investigate after receiving this letter, which made it impossible for this new proposal to be hindered by conservative ideas again. The "Pravda's" investigation work was so thorough, comprehensive, detailed, and thoughtful that it discovered the consistent shortcomings and problems in the ministry's work of promoting new proposals. After understanding the whole situation, the newspaper insisted on the principled struggle regardless of face, which not only educated the relevant personnel and improved the work of the criticized agency, but also sounded the alarm for all those with conservative ideas. This practice of "Pravda" fully demonstrates their high Party spirit principles and serious and responsible spirit in handling letters.

    The "Pravda" editorial department treats any small requests and opinions of the masses with great seriousness and responsibility, and never considers it a trouble or burden. A citizen in Moscow visited the "Pravda" editorial department, reflecting the problem of water pipes not working in the newly built houses on Besorya Street in Moscow. The comrade who received the visitor at that time went to check with him and confirmed that the water pipes were indeed not working. So they went to the City Soviet together, met the Vice-Chairman, and asked him to immediately notify the construction unit in charge to improve the work. Sure enough, two days later, the newspaper received a call from the visitor saying that the water pipes had been repaired.

    Handling letters from the masses must have a high degree of concern and responsibility for the masses, political sensitivity and great patience, and a high degree of Party spirit principles and the spirit of insisting on struggle. If there is no sympathy for the opinions and requirements of the masses, no emotional resonance can be aroused, and there is no political sense of responsibility to serve the masses, it is impossible to conduct detailed research and in-depth investigation on the materials reflected by the masses; if the political sense of smell is not sensitive and the essence of the problem and its universal significance cannot be seen through some daily life and small events, it is natural that the opinions of the masses cannot be raised to higher political principles for handling; or, although the correctness of the opinions raised by the masses is recognized, but the Party's principles are not dared to be insisted on, and the result of fighting against all conservative, backward, and bureaucratic phenomena will inevitably make our work of handling letters remain for a long time at the stage of trivial, transactional, and low-level, and cannot fully exert the political significance and vivid combat power of the work of handling letters from the masses.

    It is precisely because "Pravda" attaches great importance to the work of handling letters from laborers, and the entire editorial department is carefully and enthusiastically handling each letter, that the number of letters it receives is increasing year by year. "Pravda" absorbs the vivid and creative ideas of the working masses from this endless source of letters from laborers, so the content of the newspaper is becoming increasingly rich and fully playing the role of collective propagandist, agitator, and organizer. And for the staff of the editorial department, through handling letters, they can maintain closer contact with the masses and reality, which makes them more fulfilled in all aspects.

    The "Pravda" editorial department's attention to letters from laborers is specifically reflected in the following aspects. First of all, a large number of letters are published through various forms of reporting, and major problems raised in the letters are supported and resolved in the newspaper. This enables "Pravda" to guide life forward more powerfully. After the Communist Party of the Soviet Union put forward the task of vigorously developing light industry and food industry production, "Pravda" successively published letters titled "It's Time, the Ministry of Chemical Industry Should Supply Good Dyes to Textile Workers!" and "The Machine Manufacturing Industry Should Expand Production Equipment for Light Industry" in August and September last year. The former letter was co-written by three masters of technical sciences and two engineers, who stated in the letter that the dye supply work could not keep up with the needs of the development of the textile industry and suggested that the Ministry of Chemical Industry should improve its work as soon as possible. The latter letter was written by six people including a doctor of technical sciences, emphasizing that in order to vigorously develop light industry, the machine manufacturing industry must supply good machines. These letters timely put forward important suggestions related to the implementation of the Party's decision, which has a positive effect on promoting cooperation between various departments to achieve the Party's tasks. Letters from laborers often raise many important criticisms. Publishing these criticisms can enhance the combat power of the newspaper. On December 14th last year, "Pravda" published an article titled "Why are Coastal Mines Backward?" It was co-written by workers, the Party Committee Secretary, and the Socialist Labor Hero of this mine. They severely criticized the Soviet Ministry of Coal Industry in the article, and also criticized the minister of this ministry. The article said:

    "... Comrade Zasyadko, Minister of the Coal Industry, came to our mine in May this year, and we had many expectations, but, to be honest, Comrade Minister disappointed us. He promised a lot, but did very little."

    The comrades of "Pravda" told us: The newspaper is to defend the interests of the country and the people, and should criticize the shortcomings of the leaders of economic work without scruples. Without such criticism, the construction work cannot be well promoted. Because they attach great importance to criticism from the masses, letters from laborers have become the main source of topics for short essays, the most sharp critical articles. Last year, "Pravda" published 125 short essays, more than 90 of which were written based on the problems raised and materials provided in letters. The authors of newspaper editorials are also willing to use letters as materials for editorials, or to obtain editorial topics from letters. Because facts are the most convincing, and guiding remarks must be based on reality. The Literature and Art Department of "Pravda" once received letters from some readers asking: Why is diversity required in writers' creations? Some people also wrote letters suggesting that "creation can not follow the principles of socialist realism." In order to solve these problems of readers, the Literature and Art Department wrote an editorial "On Principles and Creative Boldness," pointing out that creation should not violate the principles of socialist realism, but within the scope of this principle, there should be a wide range of themes, and should not repeat themes in a narrow circle. This editorial not only educated readers in literary theory, but also pointed out the existing problems in current literary and artistic creation. Obviously, its publicity effect is much greater than individually answering letters. "Pravda" often has many vivid columns, such as "Letters to the Editorial Department," "Current Issues," "Results of Handling Unpublished Letters," "Reactions to 'Pravda' Materials"... all of which are set up to strive to publish more letters from laborers, letter summaries, and commentaries. Another point that we should learn from "Pravda" in publishing letters is that strict investigation work must be carried out before publishing letters. "Pravda" conducts investigations on the authors' situation and the authenticity of the content of each published letter, and they have been implementing it as an iron discipline. This is because "Pravda" is the organ newspaper of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the facts of the letters published in "Pravda" are all true and accurate, and the people who publish letters in "Pravda" are also people who have not done bad things politically and morally. This is one of the main reasons why "Pravda" enjoys a high political prestige in the Soviet people and has a strong combat power.

    Secondly, "Pravda's" attention to the work of handling letters is also reflected in the full use of some letter materials that are not suitable for publication. They use various methods to ensure that every opinion in the masses' letters can play a practical role in the work of the Party and the country, and not let it sit idle in the file cabinet. In the work of handling letters, they pay attention to what new problems the letters have raised, or which types of letters have increased, and immediately concentrate these materials for research and compile them into reference documents, some of which are provided to the Central Committee of the CPSU to understand the situation, and some are sent to relevant leading agencies to study and improve their work. For example: In the autumn of last year, the "Pravda" editorial department received some letters reflecting that the repair work of public housing in Moscow was not very good. The Department of Letters from Laborers sorted out these materials and sent them to Comrade Mikhailov, Secretary of the Moscow Oblast Party Committee. Comrade Mikhailov brought it to the Oblast Party Committee for discussion, and the Oblast Party Committee decided to let the City Soviet solve it. The City Soviet ordered the city representatives to inspect various districts, and after discussion by the City Soviet meeting, made a resolution to improve the housing repair work, and dealt with the relevant dereliction of duty personnel. The City Soviet also sent the resolution on this issue to the editorial department. The Department of Letters from Laborers wrote a short article based on the resolution of the City Soviet and published it in the column "Results of Handling Unpublished Letters." Last year, in addition to systematically reflecting the situation in the work of some local Party organizations to the Central Committee of the CPSU, the Department of Letters from Laborers of "Pravda" published a total of 100 items of information beneficial to all aspects of work throughout the year. According to the experience of "Pravda," this is an important method of using a large number of letter materials. This practice has a positive effect on strengthening the connection between the Party and the masses and giving play to the masses' supervision of the Party and the country's work; at the same time, publicizing the actual results of the letters to the masses can also encourage the masses to continue to contact the Party newspaper.

    Finally, it should be emphasized that the "Pravda" editorial department has a handling result and a reply for every letter received. This is an unshakable principle of "Pravda" in handling letters, and it is also a concrete manifestation of their highly responsible attitude towards letters.

    The "Pravda" editorial department treats every letter as seriously as it treats political documents, because the letter is from the master of the country—the Soviet people. The "Pravda" editorial department cherishes every letter as it respects and loves the Soviet people. All letters sent to the editorial department must be carefully and seriously registered by the Department of Letters from Laborers, and then analyze and study the handling principles of each letter; the Department of Letters from Laborers writes letters to the readers, telling the letter writer the preliminary handling situation; when the problem raised by the reader is resolved, the handling result is responsibly replied to the masses. This allows the masses to know the handling situation and whereabouts of the letters they sent to the editorial department at any time. Last year, the "Pravda" editorial department had handling results and replies for all 400,000 letters received, and the time was timely, without any backlog. This encouraged the masses to continue to write letters, preparing conditions for the newspaper to further unite more masses.

    In the work of handling letters from laborers, "Pravda" not only has a high degree of Party spirit and mass principles, not only has a serious and responsible work style, but also has scientific organizational guarantees and system guarantees—earnestly implementing the principle of the entire editorial department handling the work of letters. The principle that each department of the editorial department handles letters from laborers, and particularly important letters are approved and handled by the editor-in-chief. The Department of Letters from Laborers selects letters related to the business of each department of the editorial department from all the letters and forwards them to each department for handling. After receiving the letters, each department must first be reviewed by the editor-in-chief of the department, and then distributed to the relevant editors for handling; the reply letters from each department to the readers are also reviewed by the editor-in-chief and then returned to the Department of Letters for unified delivery to the readers. Last year, the Industrial, Transportation, and Trade Department of the "Pravda" editorial department handled a total of 3,000 letters, although not many were published, it had great inspiration for formulating reporting plans; letters that could not be published were also transferred by the department to relevant departments for specific handling. The Literature and Art Department sends 400 to 800 reply letters to beginners in poetry writing every week, telling them the shortcomings in their poems and the points to be paid attention to in writing poetry. Some of these reply letters are written by the Literature and Art Department itself, and some are organized by outside writers; but all reply letters must be reviewed by the editor-in-chief of the Literature and Art Department. The Marxist-Leninist Theory Propaganda Department receives 30 to 40 letters every day asking to answer theoretical questions, most of which are answered to readers in the form of individual replies, and some of which are questions of universal significance, which are answered publicly through the newspaper. Other departments also attach great importance to handling letters related to the department's business. Therefore, every letter received by "Pravda" can be correctly handled and fully utilized, giving full play to the maximum effectiveness and role of the letters.

    The purpose of learning from the work experience of Soviet newspapers and periodicals is to improve and improve our work. Under the leadership of the Party, the work of handling readers' letters by our Party newspapers has played a certain role in strengthening the connection between the newspaper and the broad masses of people and mobilizing the masses to actively participate in the work of national management; however, there are still many shortcomings and problems in the work.

    Among the majority of newspaper staff, there is a long-standing and unresolved issue of understanding the work of handling readers' letters—is the work of handling readers' letters serving the masses or serving the newspaper? The occurrence and existence of this problem shows that among a part of the newspaper staff, it is considered that serving the masses and serving the newspaper are two different things, and they oppose serving the masses and serving the newspaper. They mistakenly believe that the purpose of the newspaper contacting the masses is only to obtain ready-made materials that can be published; if the large number of letters received by the newspaper editorial department cannot only be published, but also require solving these or those problems, supporting the masses' accusations against someone or the initiatives on something, these newspaper staff believe that this kind of work is an extra burden that is divorced from the editorial business, and is a tedious transactional work.

    It is precisely because this problem of understanding has not been timely and correctly resolved that phenomena of not being serious enough and not being responsible enough have arisen in the work of handling letters. First of all, a part of the readers' letters sent to the newspaper editorial department are like stones sinking into the sea, with no response; or, although the readers have received a reply from the editorial department, they cannot get responsible and useful opinions from the reply, and the time interval is too long; this will make some of the masses lose interest in contacting the newspaper. Secondly, the editorial department has not taken on strict inspection and supervision responsibilities for a part of the letters transferred to relevant departments for handling, which has contributed to the growth of bureaucratic phenomena that do not pay attention to letters from the masses; especially serious is that it has not carried out resolute struggles against some phenomena of suppressing criticism from the masses and retaliating against critics, which has affected the wide development of mass-based bottom-up criticism. Thirdly, strict investigation work has not been carried out before publishing readers' letters, resulting in some letters being untrue or criticisms being incorrect; thus causing undue losses to the political prestige of the newspaper. Fourthly, concentrated research work on the basis of letters is done very little, especially not regularly. Some materials and opinions scattered in various letters are often filed under the name of "for reference," but they are not timely organized into systematic situations or complete opinions to provide to Party and government leading agencies to inspect and improve their work, so these materials have not played their due role, and the connection between the Party and the people has been weakened. Finally, also precisely because the problem of understanding whether the work of handling readers' letters is serving the masses or serving the newspaper has not been correctly resolved, the principle of the entire editorial department handling the work of letters cannot be well implemented. Some newspaper editorial departments have not yet clearly stipulated the principle of the entire editorial department handling readers' letters. Only the letters group handles letters, and other groups of the editorial department rarely handle letters; some editorial departments, although stipulate that the work of handling letters is the task of all staff of the entire editorial department, in fact, only individual editors in each group handle letters, and the group leader rarely handles letters; this makes the correct handling and full use of readers' letters lose the due organizational guarantee.

    Although these shortcomings exist in varying degrees in the editorial departments of various newspapers, and the severity varies; however, learning the highly serious and responsible working spirit of the "Pravda" editorial department, further correcting the understanding of readers' letters, and strengthening the editorial department's work of handling readers' letters are still the tasks that we urgently need to strive to achieve at present.

    The Party newspaper is the newspaper of the people. Its characteristics are reflected in: It is not only a newspaper for the people to read, but also a newspaper run by the people themselves. Lenin once said: "Give the workers more possibilities to write for our newspapers, let them bravely write everything, let them write as much as possible about their daily life, interests, and work—without such materials, the Social Democratic newspaper is not worth half a penny..." ("Collection of Bolshevik Newspapers and Periodicals" Part Two, page 73.) To this end, the Party newspaper must contact the masses through various ways; and readers' letters are the most extensive form of contact between the Party newspaper and the broad masses. The purpose of the Party newspaper communicating with the people is not only to obtain materials, but also to make the newspaper familiar with the environment—listening to the opinions and requirements of the masses in all aspects. We can help the editorial department study the ideological trends of the masses by correctly handling these letters, and constantly put forward new reporting policies and reporting content to improve the level of the Party newspaper; and timely support for the criticisms from the masses also strengthens the connection between the Party and the masses, and helps the Party to improve the shortcomings and mistakes in its work; on the basis of extensive contact with the masses, it can further cultivate and select correspondents and activists who often and consciously cooperate with the newspaper, and expand the mass team of the Party newspaper. Therefore, serving the masses is also serving the newspaper. The task of the Party newspaper is to serve the people. The responsibility of the Party newspaper worker lies in constantly strengthening the connection with the masses, and through various forms helping the people develop their talents and wisdom, and give play to their pioneering spirit and active role in various fields of national construction.

    学习“真理报”读者来信工作经验
    徐兑
    “真理报”收到的来信一年比一年多。一九四八年收到十九万八千件来信（包括来稿，统称来信，下同），去年已经增加到四十万件了。这一方面说明了苏联人民有着高度的政治觉悟，他们积极地通过“真理报”向党、向全国人民表达自己的意志，不断地把自己对工作的意见、生活要求、以及自己为建设共产主义所创造的成就和内心喜悦写信告诉“真理报”；另一方面，也说明了“真理报”对劳动者来信工作的重视，得到了苏联人民的无限信任和爱戴，因而团结了日益众多的群众在报纸的周围。
      “真理报”编辑部是怎样重视劳动者来信工作的呢？可以用一句话来回答：他们是以对苏联人民和对党高度负责的精神处理劳动者来信的。这可以下面的具体事例来说明：
    去年十二月十八日，“真理报”在“生产革新者路上的保守主义和停滞不前”一文中，尖锐地批评了苏联建筑材料工业部副部长以及技术管理处的领导人拖延和以官僚主义的态度对待合理化建议的错误。这篇文章是根据一封来信反映的材料经过调查后写成的。原来，有一位先进生产者给“真理报”编辑部写了一封信，说他有一个新的建议被建筑材料工业部压下了，很久未能实行。“真理报”编辑部为了支持先进生产者的新建议，决定由报社的工业运输和贸易部派一位记者，并邀请一位工程师同去建筑材料工业部作调查。他们用了一个星期的时间，检查了这个部几年来关于采用新建议的决议和指示，发现这个部为推广群众新建议而发的指示虽然很多，但实现的却很少，原因是监督指示执行的工作做的很不好。为了解决群众来信中提出的这个具体问题，他们和部里赞成这个新建议的人谈了话，了解了建议未能实行的原因；他们又和反对新建议的人包括共产党员和领导人谈了话；也访问了部长。他们发现这个新建议所以未能实现，是因为负责采用建议的人不相信群众的智慧，有着严重的保守思想，而副部长对这件事也未加过问。
    文章发表后，建筑材料工业部为这个问题举行了专门的部务会议。会议还请了先进生产者和有关方面的人来参加，给予他们充分发言的机会。会议并决定把对这件事负直接责任的技术管理处副处长撤职，对其他有关的人给予警告处分。这个部的各主管部门都召开了党的会议，针对保守主义思想进行了严格的批评。这篇文章也引起了其他工业部门的注意。
    我们从“真理报”编辑部对这封来信的处理中可以受到很大的教育。“真理报”编辑部在接到这封来信后，立即派人进行了调查，它这就使得这个新建议不可能再遭到保守思想的阻碍。“真理报”所作的调查工作是那样的深入、全面、细致和周到，结果发现了这个部在推广新建议工作中一贯存在的缺点和问题。报纸在了解了全部情况之后，不顾情面地坚持了原则的斗争，这样，就不仅教育了有关的人员，改进了被批评机关的工作，而且向一切存在保守思想的人敲起了警钟。“真理报”的这种做法，充分表现了他们在处理来信工作中的高度的党性原则和严肃负责的精神。
    “真理报”编辑部对待群众任何一个细小的要求和意见，都是非常严肃负责地处理，从来不认为是一种麻烦或负担。莫斯科有一个市民到“真理报”编辑部来访，反映了莫斯科别索里亚街新建房子中水管不通的问题。当时接待来访的同志就和他一同去检查，证实水管子的确不通。于是他们一起去到市苏维埃，见了副主席，要求他立刻通知负责建筑的单位改进工作。果然，过了两天报社就接到来访者的电话，说水管子已经修好了。
    处理群众来信必须具有高度的对群众的关怀和责任感，具有政治上的敏感和非常的耐心，具有高度的党性原则和坚持斗争的精神。如果对群众的意见和要求没有同情，不能引起感情上的共鸣，没有为群众服务的政治责任感，就不可能对群众反映的材料作细致的研究和深入的调查工作；如果政治嗅觉不灵敏，不能够通过一些日常生活和细小的事件看到问题的实质和它的普遍意义，自然也就不能够把群众的意见提到更高的政治原则上来处理；或者是，虽然认识到群众所提意见的正确性，但不敢坚持党的原则，和一切保守落后以及官僚主义现象作斗争，其结果必然会使我们的处理来信工作长期地停留在繁琐的、事务的、低级水平的阶段上，而不能充分发挥群众来信工作的政治意义和生动的战斗力量。
    正由于“真理报”极为重视劳动者来信的工作，全编辑部都是在细心地、热情负责地处理着每一封来信，因此它收到的来信逐年增多。“真理报”从劳动者来信这一无尽的源泉里，吸收着劳动群众生动而有创造性的思想，因而报纸的内容也就日益丰富，日益完满地发挥着集体的宣传者、鼓动者和组织者的作用。而对于编辑部的工作人员来说，通过处理来信可以更密切地保持与群众与实际的联系，也就使自己在各方面更加充实起来。
    “真理报”编辑部对劳动者来信的重视，具体表现在以下几方面。首先是通过各种报道形式大量发表来信，在报纸上支持和解决来信中提出的重大的问题。这就使“真理报”能更有力地指导着生活前进。苏联共产党提出大力发展轻工业和食品工业生产的任务之后，“真理报”曾在去年八、九月间，先后发表了题名为“是时候了，化学工业部应供给纺织员工好的染料！”和“机器制造工业部应为轻工业扩大生产装备”等来信。前一封是由三个技术科学硕士和两个工程师联名写的，他们在信中说明染料供应工作赶不上纺织业发展的需要，建议化学工业部赶紧改进工作。后一封信是技术科学博士等六人写的，着重说明为了大力发展轻工业，机器制造工业部门必须供给好的机器。这些信及时地提出了有关贯彻党的决定的重要建议，对推进各部门之间的协同合作以实现党的任务，有积极的作用。劳动者来信常常提出很多重要的批评。发表这些批评，就可以增强报纸的战斗力量。去年十二月十四日，“真理报”发表了一篇文章，题目是“为什么沿海矿山落后？”是这个矿山的工人、党委书记和社会主义劳动英雄联名写的。他们在文章中严厉地批评了苏联煤矿工业部，同时也批评了这个部的部长。文章中说：
  “……今年五月煤矿工业部部长札霞迪科同志到我们矿山来了，我们有很多期待，但是，说实话，部长同志使我们伤心。他答应得很多，做得却很少。”
  “真理报”的同志对我们说：报纸是保卫国家和人民利益的，应该无顾忌地批评经济工作领导人的缺点。没有这样的批评，就不能很好地推动建设工作前进。由于他们非常重视来自群众中的批评，劳动者来信就成为小品文这种最尖锐的批评性文章主题的主要来源。去年“真理报”发表了一百二十五篇小品文，其中有九十多篇，是根据来信提出的问题和提供的材料写的。报纸社论的作者也都愿意用来信作为社论的材料，或者从来信中取得社论的主题。因为事实是最富有说服力的，而有指导作用的言论，又必须是从实际出发的。“真理报”的文学和艺术部曾经收到有些读者来信询问：为什么要求作家的创作要有多样性？也有人来信提出“创作可以不遵守社会主义现实主义的原则”。为了解决读者的这些问题，文学和艺术部写了一篇社论“论原则性和创作的大胆”，指出创作不应违反社会主义现实主义的原则，但在这个原则范围内，应有广泛的题材，而不应在狭小的圈子里互相重复主题。这篇社论不仅从文学理论上教育了读者，并且指出了当前文艺创作中存在的问题。显然，它的宣传效果要比个别回答来信的做法大得多。“真理报”上经常有许多生动的栏目，如“给编辑部的信”“当前问题”“未经发表的来信的处理结果”“对‘真理报’材料的反应”……都是为了争取更多地发表劳动者来信、来信综述和述评而设立的。在发表来信工作上，我们应该向“真理报”学习的另一点是，在发表来信之前必须进行严格的调查工作。“真理报”对每一封发表的来信都要调查作者的情况和信件内容的真实性，他们已把它作为一条铁的纪律在执行着。这是因为“真理报”是苏联共产党中央的机关报，在“真理报”上发表的来信事实都是真实准确的，而在“真理报”上发表来信的人，也都是政治上和道德上没有做过坏事的人。这就是“真理报”在苏联人民中所以享有高度的政治威信和具有坚强的战斗力量的主要原因之一。
    其次，“真理报”对来信工作的重视，还表现在对有些不宜于发表的来信材料的充分运用。他们通过各种方式，使群众来信中的每一点意见都能够对党和国家的工作发挥实际的作用，而不让它白白地闲放在档案柜子里。他们在处理来信工作中，随时注意来信提出了那些新的问题，或者是那一类的来信增多了，马上就集中这些材料进行研究并编写成参考文件，有的供给苏共中央了解情况，有的送给有关领导机关研究改进工作。比如：去年秋天，“真理报”编辑部收到一些来信，反映莫斯科市公共住宅的修理工作不很好。劳动者来信部就将这些材料整理出来，送给莫斯科州委书记米哈伊洛夫同志。米哈伊洛夫同志把它带到州委会上进行了讨论，州委会决定让市苏维埃解决。市苏维埃责成市代表到各区作了检查，经过市苏维埃会议的讨论，作出了改进住宅修理工作的决议，并对有关失职人员作了处理。市苏维埃并把对这一问题的决议送到编辑部。劳动者来信部根据市苏维埃的决议写了一篇短文，在“未经发表的来信的处理结果”栏内发表了。去年，“真理报”劳动者来信部除向苏共中央系统地反映了某些地方党组织工作中的情况外，全年共发表了有益于各方面工作的情况一百件。根据“真理报”的经验，这是大量运用来信材料的一种重要方法。这种做法对加强党和群众的联系，发挥群众对党和国家工作的监督有积极的作用；同时，将来信所收到的实际效果向群众公布，也可以鼓舞群众继续和党报联系的积极性。
    最后，应该着重说明的是，“真理报”编辑部对收到的每一封信，都有处理结果、有答复，这是“真理报”在处理来信工作中一个不可动摇的原则，这也是他们重视来信的高度负责的具体表现。
  “真理报”编辑部对待每一封来信，如同对待政治文件一样的重视，因为来信的是国家主人——苏联人民，“真理报”编辑部像尊敬和爱护苏联人民那样珍视每一封来信。所有寄给编辑部的来信，都要由劳动者来信部仔细认真地登记，而后分析研究每一封信的处理原则；由来信部给读者写信，告诉来信人初步处理情况；当读者所提问题处理结束时，再把处理结果向群众作负责的答复。这就使群众随时都知道他寄给编辑部的信的处理情况和下落。去年“真理报”编辑部收到的四十万件来信都有处理结果、有答复，时间也及时，没有积压。这就鼓励了群众继续来信的积极性，为报纸进一步团结更多的群众准备了条件。
   “真理报”在处理劳动者来信工作中，不仅有高度的党性和群众性的原则，不仅有严肃认真的工作作风，也有科学的组织保证和制度保证——认真地执行全编辑部处理来信工作的原则。编辑部各部都处理劳动者来信，特别重要的信件由总编辑批示处理的原则。劳动者来信部从全部来信中，挑选出与编辑部各部业务有关的来信转到各部处理。各个部收到来信后，首先要经部主编批阅，然后再分给有关编辑处理；各部给读者的复信，也都经主编审阅后，退来信部统一发交读者。去年“真理报”编辑部工业、运输和贸易部共处理了三千封来信，其中发表的虽然不多，但对制订报道计划却有很大的启示；不能发表的来信，也都由该部转给有关部门去具体处理了。文学和艺术部每周要发给初学写诗者的复信四百到八百封，告诉他们所写的诗中的缺点和写诗应该注意的问题。这些复信有的是文学和艺术部自己写的，有的是组织外面作家写的；但全部复信都要经过文学和艺术部主编审阅。马克思列宁主义理论宣传部每天收到三四十封要求解答理论问题的来信，其中大部分是用个别复信的方式回答读者，有些是具有普遍意义的问题，就通过报纸公开答复。其他各部也都非常重视处理与本部业务有关的来信。因此“真理报”收到的每一封来信都能得到正确处理和充分运用，发挥了来信的最大效能和作用。
    学习苏联报刊工作经验的目的，在于改进和提高我们的工作。我们党报的读者来信工作，在党的领导下，经过各报编辑部的努力，对加强报纸和广大群众的联系，发动群众积极参加国家管理工作，都起了一定的作用；但工作中存在的缺点和问题还是很多的。
    在多数报纸工作人员中，对读者来信工作长期存在着一个没有解决的认识问题——读者来信工作究竟是为群众服务还是为报纸服务？这个问题的发生和存在，就说明了在一部分报纸工作人员中，认为为群众服务和为报纸服务是两回事，他们把为群众服务和为报纸服务对立起来了。他们错误地认为报纸联系群众的目的，只是为了取得现成的、可以发表的材料；如果报纸编辑部收到的读者的大量来信不仅不能发表，而且是要求解决这些或那些问题、支持群众对某人的控诉或对某件事的倡议，这些报纸工作人员就认为这种工作是脱离了编辑业务的额外负担，是繁琐的事务工作。
    正由于这种认识问题没有得到及时的、正确的解决，在处理来信工作中也就产生了不够严肃和不够负责的现象。首先是有一部分读者来信寄到报纸编辑部后，如同石沉大海，没有回音；或者是，读者虽然收到了编辑部的回信，但不能从回信中得到负责的和有益的意见，而且时间相隔太久；这就会使一部分群众失去了和报纸联系的兴趣。其次，编辑部对转给有关部门处理的一部分来信，没有负起严格的检查和监督责任，这就助长了不重视群众来信的官僚主义现象的滋长；尤其严重的是，对有些压制群众批评和打击报复批评者的现象没有进行坚决的斗争，影响了群众性的自下而上的批评的广泛开展。第三，在发表读者来信之前，没有进行严格的调查工作，结果有的来信不真实或批评不正确；因而使报纸的政治威信受到了不应有的损失。第四，在来信基础上的集中研究工作做得很少，尤其是不经常，有些分散在各件来信中的材料和意见，往往在“留作参考”的名义下存了档，而没有及时地整理成为系统的情况或完整的意见，提供党和政府领导机关检查和改进工作，因而使这些材料没有起到应有的作用，也削弱了党和人民之间的联系。最后，也正由于读者来信工作究竟是为群众服务还是为报纸服务的认识问题，没有得到正确的解决，全编辑部处理来信工作的原则也就不能很好地贯彻。有的报纸的编辑部，至今仍然没有明确规定全编辑部处理读者来信的原则，只是来信组处理来信，编辑部其他组都很少处理来信；有的编辑部虽然规定了处理来信工作是全编辑部全体人员的任务，但实际上各组处理来信的只是个别编辑，组长很少处理来信；这就使读者来信工作的正确处理和充分运用，失去了应有的组织保证。
    这些缺点虽然在各报编辑部存在的有多有少，严重程度也各有不同；但是，学习“真理报”编辑部高度严肃负责的工作精神，进一步端正对读者来信的认识，加强编辑部的读者来信工作，仍然是我们目前急需努力实现的任务。
    党报是人民群众的报纸。它的特点就表现在：不仅是办给人民群众看的报纸，而且是人民群众自己办的报纸。列宁曾经说过：“多给工人们以可能，使他们能为我们的报纸写作，使他们勇敢地写出一切，使他们尽可能多写自己底日常生活、兴趣和工作——如果没有这种材料，社会民主党的机关报便不值半文钱，……”（“布尔什维克报刊文集”第二部，第七十三页。）为此，党报必须通过各种方式和群众取得联系；而读者来信就是党报和广大群众取得联系的一种最广泛的形式。党报和人民群众通信，目的不仅是为了得到材料，而且是使报纸熟悉环境——倾听群众对各方面的意见和要求。我们正确地处理这些来信，就可以帮助编辑部研究群众思想动向，不断提出新的报道方针和报道内容，提高党报的水平；而对来自群众中的批评的及时支持，也就加强了党和群众的联系，帮助了党改进工作中的缺点和错误；在广泛联系群众的基础上，又可以进一步培养和挑选出经常、自觉地和报纸合作的通讯员和积极分子，扩大党报的群众队伍。因此，为群众服务也就是为报纸服务。党报的任务就是为人民服务。党报工作者的责任就在于经常不断地加强与群众的联系，通过各种形式帮助人民发展其才能和智慧，发挥他们在国家建设的各个领域中的首创精神和积极作用。
