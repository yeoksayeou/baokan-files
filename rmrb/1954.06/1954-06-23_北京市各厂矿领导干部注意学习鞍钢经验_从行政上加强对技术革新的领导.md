    Beijing Factories and Mines: Leading Cadres Should Pay Attention to Learning from the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Experience – Strengthen Leadership of Technological Innovation Administratively

    [This newspaper reports] Beijing's factory and mine administrative leading cadres are studying the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company’s technological innovation movement and are beginning to take measures to strengthen leadership over the technological innovation of the masses of workers.

    The leading cadres of Beijing’s factories and mines, after studying the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in carrying out the technological innovation movement, have examined errors such as not paying enough attention to the rationalization proposals of the masses in the past. In the past, in the work of leading and handling rationalization proposals from workers in Beijing's factories and mines, the responsibilities of the administration and the trade union were generally not clear enough. Some administrative cadres believed that "rationalization proposals are the business of the trade union" and regarded handling the masses' rationalization proposals as an "extra burden." Most enterprise administrations did not establish special institutions to register, review, and technically appraise the suggestions of the masses. Many units had a rationalization proposal committee composed of leaders from the Party, government, trade union, and the Communist Youth League, but most of them were just a formality and often could not even hold meetings. In reality, rationalization proposal work was only done by the trade union and a few full-time cadres, who could only play the role of receiving, sending, and registering. Therefore, the phenomenon of official circulars, backlog, and loss of rationalization proposals was quite common. Even if a suggestion could be adopted, it would be delayed for a long time due to the lack of clear regulations in design, drafting, construction, and raw material supply. For example, Wang Lizhong, a labor model from the Beijing Electric Power Bureau, had continuously put forward sixteen or seventeen rationalization proposals since November of last year. After these suggestions were forwarded to the administration by the trade union's rationalization proposal committee, they were transferred back and forth between the director's office and the relevant functional departments, with many approvals, but none of them have been resolved so far, and some of the original proposals are even incomplete or lost.

    Recently, units such as the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory and Shijingshan Power Plant have initially proposed plans to improve the leadership of rationalization proposals. The common feature of these plans is that they clearly stipulate the responsibilities of the administration and the trade union. The administration should set up special institutions and register, review, and handle the suggestions of the masses at different levels according to the principle of a three-level and one-chief system (i.e., factory director or chief engineer, workshop director, and section chief). Some practical measures have also been stipulated for the adopted suggestions in terms of design, drafting, inclusion in the work plan, and organization of construction forces, so that rationalization suggestions can be implemented in a timely manner. The plan also stipulates that the trade union should also establish appropriate organizations, such as a rationalization proposal committee or a sub-group under the production work committee, and absorb active rationalization proposal activists from major types of work to participate. Their main tasks are: to publicize the rationalization proposal topics put forward by the administration, to convene production meetings to absorb the opinions of the masses, to supplement the deficiencies of the administrative topics; to organize collective research on the topics; to supervise the administrative rationalization proposal institutions to handle the suggestions of the masses in a timely manner; and to assist the administration in promoting the adopted suggestions.

    At present, the administration of some units is assigning cadres and establishing organizations according to the new plan. For example, the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory is transferring two technicians and three old technicians of the sixth and seventh grades to form a rationalization proposal group under the technical section. In order to solve the shortage of construction forces for rationalization proposals, in addition to the administrative side preparing to transfer six fitters and five lathe operators to strengthen the tool workshop, the trade union will organize eleven technicians with certain drafting skills to form an amateur drafting room on a voluntary basis. The Shijingshan Power Plant Trade Union recently held an enlarged meeting of rationalization proposal activists and invited the chief engineer to report on the shortcomings of the rationalization proposal work in the past and the future improvement plan. The factory also stipulates that in the future, the administrative workshop director should report the handling of rationalization proposals at the production meetings convened by the trade union every month in order to accept the criticism and supervision of the masses.

    北京市各厂矿领导干部注意学习鞍钢经验
    从行政上加强对技术革新的领导
    【本报讯】北京市各厂矿行政领导干部学习鞍钢技术革新运动的经验，开始采取措施，加强对职工群众技术革新的领导。
    北京市各厂矿的领导干部，学习鞍钢开展技术革新运动的经验，检查了过去对群众的合理化建议不够重视等错误。过去，北京市各厂矿在领导与处理职工合理化建议的工作中，行政与工会的职责一般都不够明确，有些行政干部认为“合理化建议是工会的事”，对处理群众的合理化建议看成是“额外负担”。企业行政方面大都没有建立专门机构，对群众的建议进行登记、审核与技术鉴定的工作。很多单位都是由党、政、工、团负责人组成合理化建议委员会，但大多流于形式，往往连会都开不成。实际上合理化建议工作仅由工会和少数专职干部去做，他们只能起到收发登记的作用。所以，合理化建议的公文旅行、积压和遗失现象相当普遍。即使能被采纳的建议，也因在设计制图、施工、原材料供应等方面没有一套明确规定，长期拖延不能实现。如北京电业局劳动模范王立忠等，自去年十一月起曾连续提出十六、七项合理化建议，这些建议经工会合理化建议委员会转送行政后，即在局长室及有关职能科之间转来转去，批了很多条子，但至今一件还未解决，有的甚至连原建议书都残缺不全或丢失了。
    最近，华北农业机械总厂和石景山发电厂等单位，已初步提出改进对合理化建议的领导方案。这些方案的共同特点是：明确地规定了行政与工会的责任，行政上要设立专门机构，按三级一长制的原则（即厂长或总工程师、车间主任、工段长），分级登记、审核和处理群众的建议。对已采纳的建议，在设计制图，编入作业计划和组织施工力量等方面也规定出一些切实的办法，使合理化建议能够及时实施。方案中还规定工会也要建立适当的组织，如合理化建议委员会或在生产工作委员会下附设小组等，吸收主要工种的合理化建议积极分子参加。其主要任务是：宣传行政上提出的合理化建议课题，召开生产会议吸收群众意见，补充行政课题之不足；针对课题组织集体研究；监督行政合理化建议机构及时处理群众的建议；对已采纳的建议协助行政加以推广。
    目前，有些单位的行政上正在根据新的方案配备干部，建立组织。如华北农业机械总厂正抽调两名技术人员和三名六、七级的老技术工人，在技术科下成立合理化建议小组。为解决合理化建议施工力量之不足，该厂除行政方面准备抽调六名钳工、五名车工加强工具车间外，工会将组织十一名有一定绘图能力的技术工人，在自愿地原则下，成立业余绘图室。石景山发电厂工会日前已召开了合理化建议积极分子扩大会议，请总工程师报告过去合理化建议工作中的缺点和今后改进方案。该厂并规定：今后行政车间主任每月要在工会召开的生产会议上报告处理合理化建议的情况，以接受群众的批评和监督。
