The spring planting of major crops in the Southwest region has been basically completed. In Sichuan, rice and dryland crops have been completely planted. In Guizhou, rice transplanting has reached 80%. In Yunnan, the drought has been basically alleviated, ensuring a larger planted area compared to last year. In most areas, over 80% of dryland crops have been planted. In the Ya'an and Xichang areas of Xikang, planting is basically completed. Under the leadership of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, farmers throughout the region have actively responded to the state's call to expand the planting area of grain, cotton, and oil crops. The cotton planting area in the entire region has increased by 6.2% compared to last year, exceeding the original state-assigned target by more than 80,000 mu. In Sichuan Province, the planting area of oil crops such as peanuts, soybeans, and sesame has increased compared to last year. Currently, crops are generally growing well. In most areas of Sichuan, mid-season cultivation and weeding have begun. In the warmer southern Sichuan region, early rice has begun to head. In southern Yunnan, early rice has begun to be harvested. Cotton seedlings in various parts of Sichuan have emerged to a height of four or five inches. In Baoshan County and the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region in Yunnan, where planting was earlier, cotton plants have begun to bud and flower. Farmers throughout the region are engaged in intense summer field management work, striving to complete the production increase plans for various crops. (Lu Yun)

     西南区大春作物播种工作已基本结束
    西南各地大春作物播种工作已基本结束。四川水稻及旱地作物全部栽种完毕，贵州水稻栽插已达百分之八十，云南旱象已基本解除，可保证按时栽插的面积较去年扩大，大部地区旱地作物已种百分之八十以上，西康雅安、西昌两专区栽种基本完毕。全区农民在互助合作组织带动下，积极响应国家号召，扩大了粮棉及油料作物的播种面积。全区植棉面积较去年扩大百分之六点二，超过国家原定分配数字八万多亩。四川省花生黄豆芝麻等油料作物种植面积都比去年扩大。目前一般作物生长良好，四川大部地区开始中耕除草，气候较温暖的川南地区早稻开始抽穗，云南南部早稻开始收割。四川各地棉苗已出土四、五寸，云南播种较早的保山县、红河豪尼族自治区等地棉株已开始现蕾开花。全区农民正投入紧张的夏季田间管理工作，力争完成各种作物的增产计划。（卢云）
