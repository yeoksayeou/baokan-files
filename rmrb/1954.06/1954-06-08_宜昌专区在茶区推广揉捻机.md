Yichang Prefecture Promotes Rolling Machines in Tea-Producing Areas

    Hubei Province, Yichang Prefecture, has achieved good results in promoting wooden rolling machines in tea-producing areas. After Liu Xinghan, a tea technician from Duzhenwan, Changyang County, successfully trial-produced a wooden rolling machine last tea season, the Yichang Commissioner's Office and the technical extension stations of various counties sent many cadres to the tea areas to promote it. The People's Government of Hubei Province also allocated 10 million yuan as promotion funds. At present, more than 50 units have been promoted throughout the region. Many handicraft carpenters in Wufeng, Changyang, and other places are actively learning the technology of manufacturing wooden rolling machines, preparing to go to the countryside to manufacture them for farmers.

    Yichang, Wufeng, Changyang, Xingshan and other tea-producing areas in Yichang Prefecture are now in the tense season of preliminary black tea production, and the rolling machine is playing its superior role. Tea farmers in Shuijinsi Township, Wufeng, and other places use rolling machines to roll 80 jin of dried tea per machine per day, which is two to three times more efficient than using foot-operated methods; as a result of this rolling, the tea refining rate has been greatly improved. This year, the top-grade tea in the first batch of tea produced by the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative accounted for two-thirds, more than double the amount in previous years. Each dan of rough black tea made with a rolling machine can produce five jin more of refined tea than that made by foot. Recently, the Changyang County People's Government used mountain streams in the fourth district of the county to convert the rolling machine to water power, which increased the efficiency by four times compared with the original. Various places are also preparing to continue to promote it. (Lin Xiao)

    宜昌专区在茶区推广揉捻机
    湖北省宜昌专区在产茶地区推广木制揉捻机，获得良好成绩。去年茶季，长阳县都镇湾茶叶技术工人刘兴汉试制木质揉捻机成功以后，宜昌专署和各县技术推广站派了很多干部到茶区推广，湖北省人民政府农林厅并拨款一千万元作为推广经费。目前全区已推广五十多部，五峰、长阳等地还有很多手工业木工都在积极学习制造木质揉捻机的技术，准备下乡替农民制造。
    宜昌专区宜昌、五峰、长阳、兴山等产茶地区，现在正是初制红茶的紧张季节，揉捻机正在发挥它的优越效能。五峰水濜司等乡茶农采用揉捻机每部每天能揉干茶八十斤，比以前用脚踩提高工效两倍到三倍；这样捻的结果，使茶叶精制率大大提高，红光农业社今年头茶中一级茶占三分之二，比往年多一倍多。用揉捻机做的毛红茶比用脚踩的每担可以多生产五斤精茶。最近，长阳县人民政府在该县第四区利用山涧溪流，将揉捻机改装用水力带动，比原来的又提高工效四倍，各地也准备继续推广。　（林啸）
