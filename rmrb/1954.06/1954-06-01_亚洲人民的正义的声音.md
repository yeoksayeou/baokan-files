    The Just Voice of the Asian People
    Gao Ji

    A prominent aspect of the Geneva Conference was the resounding voice of the People's Republic of China, speaking as a major power. The four speeches made by our Chief Representative, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, at the Geneva Conference fully expressed the Asian people's desire for peace, independence, democracy, and freedom. They were welcomed and supported by the people of Asian countries and all peace-loving people around the world, causing consternation among imperialist adventurers like Dulles and his ilk.

    In his speech on April 28th, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out: "The Asian people, like people in other parts of the world, love peace and freedom. The Asian people have long suffered oppression and enslavement. Their struggle for liberation from foreign imperialist oppression and for national independence and freedom is just. This historical trend is irresistible." In his speech on May 22nd, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai further stated: "The root cause of the problems in Asia is the colonialist aggression of imperialist countries in Asia and the resistance of the Asian people to this aggression." This reality in Asia is vividly manifested in the fundamental changes in the Asian situation brought about by the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, in the victories achieved by the Korean and Indochinese people in their just struggles for national independence and liberation, and in the rising universal call of the Asian people against the new and old colonial rule of imperialism. It is precisely this irresistible force and aspiration of the Asian people that has compelled the imperialist countries, which used to handle Asian issues arbitrarily without regard for the wishes of the Asian people, to agree to convene the Geneva Conference, attended by major powers, including the People's Republic of China, and other relevant countries, to listen to the voices of the Asian people and to examine and resolve the most pressing Asian issues.

    The peaceful settlement of the Korean and Indochinese questions is essentially a matter of respecting and guaranteeing the national rights of the Korean and Indochinese people. After being liberated from the enslavement of Japanese imperialism, the Korean people have consistently demanded the realization of Korean independence and reunification. U.S. imperialism, attempting to impose the shackles of colonialism on the entire Korean people, launched the Korean War of aggression, but was defeated by the heroic resistance of the Korean people and forced to accept the Korean armistice. After the Korean armistice, the Korean people are working to restore the peaceful reunification of their motherland. The Indochinese people have waged a heroic struggle for many years against French colonial rule and U.S. interference. The Indochinese people have demonstrated an invincible force in their national liberation struggle and have inflicted heavy blows and defeats on the French colonialists and American interventionists. The common aspiration of the Indochinese people today is to stop hostilities and restore peace in Indochina on the basis of guaranteeing their national rights. These legitimate aspirations of the Korean and Indochinese people have been specifically embodied in the reasonable proposals put forward by Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the Geneva Conference, respectively, regarding the peaceful settlement of the Korean and Indochinese questions.

    The Chinese people, who have triumphed over colonialist aggression, of course fully support the desire of their close neighbors, the Korean and Indochinese people, for peace, independence, and freedom. In his successive speeches at the Geneva Conference, our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai repeatedly expressed support for the proposals of Nam Il and Pham Van Dong, and considered that these two proposals should be the basis for reaching appropriate agreements on the peaceful settlement of the Korean question and the restoration of peace in Indochina.

    In his speech on the Korean question, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out that the peaceful reunification of Korea is a matter for the Korean people themselves. The nature of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the U.S. troops in Korea is different; the U.S. troops are there for aggression, while the Chinese People's Volunteers are there to resist aggression. Nevertheless, in order to enable the Korean people to peacefully resolve their own problems without foreign interference, the People's Republic of China still advocates the simultaneous withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. At the same time, Foreign Minister Zhou also stated that the People's Republic of China is willing to join with relevant countries to undertake the obligation to guarantee non-interference in Korean internal affairs and to ensure the peaceful development of Korea. Regarding the Indochina question, Foreign Minister Zhou pointed out in his speech that conditions that are honorable, fair, and reasonable to all parties concerned should be sought in accordance with the current actual situation in Indochina and Asia, on the basis of recognizing the national rights of the Indochinese people, and that effective measures should be taken so that a ceasefire can be achieved as soon as possible in Indochina and peace restored. Foreign Minister Zhou said: "What does it mean to recognize the national rights of the Indochinese people? It means that Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos must be recognized as having full rights to obtain their respective national independence, national unity, and democratic freedom, and to live peacefully in their respective homelands."

    Obviously, Foreign Minister Zhou's speech not only embodies the sincere attitude of the Chinese people in respecting the national rights of the Korean and Indochinese people, and the reasonable desire to peacefully resolve the Korean and Indochinese questions on this basis, but also that this just proposition is precisely the common proposition of the Asian people. It is no coincidence that the people and public opinion of Asian countries sympathize with the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and believe that the active efforts of China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Vietnam at the Geneva Conference have opened the way for the peaceful settlement of the Korean and Indochinese questions.

    However, as Foreign Minister Zhou pointed out: "Powerful groups in the United States, in order to establish their colonial rule in Asia, are intensifying interference in the Asian national independence movement, instigating the organization of Asian aggressive blocs, and expanding the war in Asia." Just before and during the Geneva Conference, the United States' activities in cobbling together a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc were intensifying. U.S. President Eisenhower further announced on May 19 that organizing a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc is "a basic policy of the United States." This approach by the United States not only bears no resemblance to the goals of the Geneva Conference, but also completely violates the wishes of the Asian people.

    The United States is not an Asian country, yet it has been plotting to establish a series of so-called defense groups in the Far East, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and the Near East. Any country in these regions is thousands of nautical miles away from the U.S. border, and it is clear that U.S. national defense security has nothing to do with these regions. From this, it can be seen that the organization of these so-called defense groups is not for any defense, but to expand colonial wars in Asia, establish new colonial empires, enslave the Asian people, and drive the Asian people to kill each other in order to seek the maximum profit for U.S. monopoly capital. Recently, in the U.S.-French conference orchestrated by Dulles, the United States openly used so-called "joint action," the separation of the three puppet regimes of Bao Dai, etc., from the French Federation and their transfer to U.S. control, U.S. training of the Bao Dai puppet army, and so-called UN "recognition" as "conditions" for its direct intervention in the Indochina war, which clearly exposed the ambition of the U.S. neo-colonialists.

    Foreign Minister Zhou pointed out: "This policy of the United States is the root cause of the tension and unease in the Asian situation." He also said: "We believe that these aggressive actions by the United States should be stopped, Asian peace should be guaranteed, the independence and sovereignty of Asian countries should be respected, the national rights and freedoms of the Asian people should be guaranteed, interference in the internal affairs of Asian countries should be stopped, foreign military bases in Asian countries should be removed, foreign troops stationed in Asian countries should be withdrawn, the revival of Japanese militarism should be prevented, and all economic blockades and restrictions should be abolished." Foreign Minister Zhou's just voice is undoubtedly a magnificent declaration of the righteousness of the Asian people. The Asian people demand peace and security, demand independence and freedom, demand that their internal affairs no longer be interfered with by the United States and other new and old colonialists, demand that they handle their own affairs themselves, demand that they no longer be threatened by U.S. aggression and the revival of Japanese militarism, and demand that they no longer suffer economic damage caused by U.S. economic blockades and restrictions. All this is perfectly legitimate and reasonable. The wishes of the Asian people must be respected; colonialism in Asia should end.

    Today, the united strength of the Asian people can safeguard Asian peace and security. In his speeches on April 28 and May 12, Foreign Minister Zhou repeatedly emphasized the issue of maintaining lasting peace and collective security in Asia. Foreign Minister Zhou said: "The Government of the People's Republic of China believes that Asian countries should consult with each other and work together to maintain peace and security in Asia by assuming corresponding obligations to each other." Asian countries should respect each other's independence and sovereignty without interfering in each other's internal affairs; they should resolve disputes between countries through peaceful consultation without the use of force or threats; they should establish and develop normal economic and cultural relations between countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit without allowing discrimination and restrictions. Asian countries, through joint efforts to maintain peace and collective security in Asia, will certainly be able to avoid the unprecedented disaster of the U.S. neo-colonialists using Asians to fight Asians in Asia, and achieve peace and security.

    Obviously, the proposal to establish collective security in Asia is in line with the interests of the Asian people and the wishes of Asian countries. The Asian people have long firmly opposed the U.S. neo-colonialists' vicious trick of "using Asians to fight Asians," and are determined to make Asia a bastion of peace. Therefore, Foreign Minister Zhou's proposal has received widespread support in Asian countries. Public opinion in various countries believes that Foreign Minister Zhou's proposal on Asian collective security is a positive plan for achieving peace in Asia. In his foreign policy speech to the People's Assembly on May 15, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, in discussing the great significance of the agreement signed between China and India on trade and communication between the Tibet region of China and India, also believed that if the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, as reflected in the Sino-Indian agreement, could be adopted in the relations between all countries, many troubles in the world would disappear. This situation clearly reflects the strong sentiment of the Asian people for Asian countries to jointly guarantee Asian peace and security.

    Foreign Minister Zhou's four speeches at the Geneva Conference clearly pointed out the correct path to resolving Asian problems and ensuring Asian peace and security, and expressed the common aspirations of the Asian people, and therefore it has been supported by the peace-loving people of Asia and the world.

    The road of the Asian people's progress cannot be stopped; the voice of the Asian people cannot be blocked. The just propositions put forward by Foreign Minister Zhou will become the goal of the common efforts of the Asian people. Any attempt to solve Asian problems without regard to the wishes of the Asian people is bound to be met with a bloody nose.

    亚洲人民的正义的声音
    高集
    日内瓦会议的一个突出的景象，是中华人民共和国以一个大国的地位发出了自己的响亮的声音。我国首席代表周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上的四次发言，充分表达了亚洲人民要求和平、独立、民主和自由的愿望，受到了亚洲各国人民及全世界爱好和平人民的欢迎和支持，而使杜勒斯之流的帝国主义冒险家们感到惊慌失措。
    周恩来外长在四月二十八日的发言中指出：“亚洲人民和世界其他各地人民一样是爱好和平和自由的。亚洲人民长期遭受压迫和奴役。他们的争取从外国帝国主义压迫下的解放和争取民族独立和自由的斗争是正义的。这个历史潮流是不可抗拒的。”周恩来外长在五月二十二日的发言中又说：“亚洲问题发生的根本原因，是帝国主义国家在亚洲的殖民主义侵略和亚洲人民对这种侵略的反抗。”亚洲的这种现实，生动地表现在中国人民革命的伟大胜利所引起的亚洲局势的根本变化上，表现在朝鲜人民和印度支那人民争取民族独立和解放的正义斗争所取得的胜利上，表现在亚洲各国人民反对帝国主义的新旧殖民统治的日益高涨的普遍呼声上。正是亚洲人民的这种不可抗拒的力量和愿望，才使得过去惯于不顾亚洲人民的愿望而专横地处理亚洲问题的帝国主义国家不得不同意召开包括中华人民共和国在内的各大国及其他有关国家参加的日内瓦会议，来倾听亚洲人民的声音，审查和解决最急迫的亚洲问题。
    和平解决朝鲜问题和印度支那问题在本质上就是尊重和保障朝鲜人民和印度支那人民民族权利的问题。朝鲜人民从日本帝国主义的奴役下解放出来以后，就一贯要求实现朝鲜的独立和统一。美帝国主义妄图将殖民主义的锁链强加在全朝鲜人民的头上，发动了侵略朝鲜战争，但由于朝鲜人民的英勇抵抗而遭到了失败，并被迫接受了朝鲜停战。在朝鲜停战后，朝鲜人民正在为恢复祖国的和平统一而努力。印度支那人民多年来为反对法国的殖民统治和美国的干涉进行了英勇的斗争。印度支那人民在民族解放斗争中表现了不可战胜的力量，并使法国殖民者和美国干涉者不断遭受到沉重的打击和失败。印度支那人民当前的共同愿望，就是在保证他们民族权利的基础上，停止敌对行为，恢复印度支那的和平。朝鲜人民和印度支那人民这种正当的愿望，已具体地体现在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相和越南民主共和国范文同代外长在日内瓦会议上分别提出的关于和平解决朝鲜问题和印度支那问题的合理建议上。
    战胜了殖民主义侵略的中国人民，对于自己的紧邻——朝鲜人民和印度支那人民要求和平、独立和自由的愿望，当然予以全力支持。我国周恩来外交部长在日内瓦会议上的历次发言中，一再表示支持南日和范文同的建议，并认为这两个建议应该成为和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平问题取得适当协议的基础。
    周恩来外长关于朝鲜问题的发言中曾指出：和平统一朝鲜是朝鲜人民自己的事情。中国人民志愿军和美国军队到朝鲜的性质是不同的；美国军队是为了侵略，而中国人民志愿军是为了反抗侵略。虽然如此，但是为了使朝鲜人民得以在不受外国干涉的条件下和平解决自己的问题，中华人民共和国仍然主张一切外国军队同时撤出朝鲜。同时，周外长并表示，中华人民共和国愿意与有关各国一道来承担保证不干涉朝鲜内政，并保障朝鲜的和平发展的义务。对于印度支那问题，周外长在他的发言中曾指出：应该按照目前印度支那及亚洲的实际情况，在承认印度支那人民的民族权利的基础上来寻求对于有关双方都是光荣的、公平的、合理的条件，并采取有效措施，以便在印度支那能够早日实现停战并恢复和平。周外长说：“怎样才算承认印度支那人民的民族权利呢？那就是必须承认越南、高棉和寮国人民有充分权利获得他们各自的民族独立、国家统一和民主自由，并在他们各自的祖国的土地上过和平生活。”
    显然，周外长的发言不但体现了中国人民尊重朝鲜人民和印度支那人民民族权利的真诚态度，和在这个基础上和平解决朝鲜问题和印度支那问题的合理愿望，并且这种正义主张也正是亚洲人民的共同的主张。亚洲各国人民和舆论都同情朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国的建议，并认为中、苏、朝、越四国在日内瓦会议上的积极努力已为和平解决朝鲜问题和印度支那问题打开了道路，这并不是偶然的。
    但是，正如周外长所指出的：“美国有势力的集团为了建立它在亚洲的殖民统治，正加紧干涉亚洲民族独立运动，策动组织亚洲侵略集团，扩大在亚洲的战争。”就在日内瓦会议召开之前和会议期间，美国拼凑东南亚侵略集团的活动正在变本加厉地进行。美国总统艾森豪威尔更于五月十九日宣布，组织东南亚侵略集团是“美国的基本政策”。美国的这种做法，不但与日内瓦会议的目标毫无相似之处，而且完全违反了亚洲人民的愿望。
    美国并不是一个亚洲国家，然而美国却一直策划在远东、东南亚、中东和近东建立一系列的所谓防御集团。这些区域中的任何一国都在远离美国国境数千海里之外，显然美国的国防安全同这些区域并无关系。由此可见，这些所谓防御集团的组织，并不是为了什么防御，而是为了在亚洲扩大殖民战争，建立新的殖民帝国，以奴役亚洲人民，并驱使亚洲人民互相残杀，来为美国垄断资本谋求最大限度的利润。最近，在杜勒斯所策划的美法会议中，美国公然以所谓“联合行动”、保大等三个傀儡政权脱离法兰西联邦而交由美国控制、美国训练保大伪军以及所谓联合国的“认可”等，作为它直接干涉印度支那战争的“条件”，这就清楚地暴露了美国新殖民主义者的野心。
    周外长指出：“美国的这种政策是造成亚洲局势的紧张和不安的根源。”并又说：“我们认为，美国的这些侵略行动应该被制止，亚洲的和平应该得到保证，亚洲各国的独立和主权应该得到尊重，亚洲人民的民族权利和自由应该得到保障，对亚洲各国内政的干涉应该停止，在亚洲各国的外国军事基地应该撤除，驻在亚洲各国的外国军队应该撤退，日本军国主义的复活应该防止，一切经济封锁和限制应该取消。”周外长的正义的声音无疑是亚洲人民的正气磅礴的宣告。亚洲人民要求和平与安全，要求独立和自由，要求他们的内政不再受美国以及其他新旧殖民主义者的干涉，要求由他们自己处理自己的事情，要求不再受美国侵略和日本军国主义复活的威胁，要求不再受美国的经济封锁和限制所造成的经济上的损害。这一切是再正当、合理不过的了。亚洲人民的这种愿望必须得到尊重；在亚洲的殖民主义应该结束了。
    今天亚洲人民团结一致的力量，能够维护亚洲的和平与安全。周外长在四月二十八日和五月十二日的发言中，一再强调了维护亚洲持久和平与集体安全的问题。周外长说：“中华人民共和国政府认为，亚洲国家彼此之间应该进行协商，以互相承担相应的义务的方法，共同努力维护亚洲的和平和安全。”亚洲国家应该互相尊重各国的独立和主权，而不互相干涉内政；应该以和平协商方法解决各国间的争端，而不使用武力和威胁；应该在平等互利的基础上建立和发展各国之间的正常的经济和文化的关系，而不容许歧视和限制。亚洲国家以共同的努力来维护亚洲的和平与集体安全，就一定可以避免美国新殖民主义者在亚洲利用亚洲人打亚洲人的空前灾难，而得到和平与安全。
    显然，在亚洲建立集体安全的主张是符合于亚洲人民的利益和亚洲国家的愿望的。亚洲人民早已坚决反对美国新殖民主义者用“亚洲人打亚洲人”的狠毒计谋，而决心要使亚洲成为和平的堡垒。因而周外长的主张在亚洲国家中得到了广泛的支持。各国舆论认为，周外长关于亚洲集体安全的主张，是实现亚洲和平的积极计划。印度总理尼赫鲁五月十五日在人民院发表的外交演说中，在论述到中印两国签订的关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定的重大意义时，也认为反映在中印协定中的互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互惠及和平共处的原则，如果能在各国相互关系中都加以采取，世界上的许多麻烦就会消失。这种情况，清楚地反映了亚洲各国人民要求亚洲国家共同保证亚洲和平与安全的强烈情绪。
    周外长在日内瓦会议上的四次发言，明确地指出了解决亚洲问题和保证亚洲和平与安全的正确道路，表达了亚洲人民的共同愿望，因而它受到亚洲和全世界爱好和平人民的拥护。
    亚洲人民前进的道路是阻止不住的；亚洲人民的声音是封锁不了的。周外长所发出的正义主张，将成为亚洲人民共同努力的目标。任何企图不顾亚洲人民的愿望而解决亚洲问题的做法，必然要碰得头破血流的。
