More than six thousand graduating students from universities and colleges in the capital are currently undergoing intensive examinations or participating in production internships, actively preparing to embark on various construction posts in the motherland. Some students have already completed their studies and enthusiastically accepted the work assigned to them by the state.

More than 120 graduates from the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology have gone to Anshan Iron and Steel Company and other places to participate in the construction of the motherland. They all expressed their determination to do well in the work assigned to them by the people. Niu Jiabi, a student majoring in geophysical prospecting at the Beijing College of Geology, was assigned to Xinjiang. He said happily: Wherever the motherland needs me, I will work there.

More than 35% of the graduates are engineering students, including talents with specialized skills in electric furnace smelting urgently needed by the country, as well as various specialized talents in oil refining, heating and ventilation, and cadres with professional knowledge in factory management and other fields. Renmin University of China has sent the first batch of graduates in diplomacy, law and other departments to the motherland. In addition, there are future teachers and doctors among the graduates.

This year, some of the graduates are worker-peasant cadres. Among the 2,279 graduates of Renmin University of China who are currently taking graduation exams, 58.6% are worker-peasant cadres, and more than 67% are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. Because they can study diligently and conscientiously, they have achieved relatively good results, with an average score of four or more in each subject in the last semester's exam.

The graduates have all participated in production internships, and some have also done course designs. The various alloy structural steels smelted by the graduates of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology during their internships were found to be fully qualified after inspection. More than 80% of the 650 graduates of Tsinghua University this year have obtained "excellent" and "good" grades. (Xinhua News Agency)

    首都高等学校
    六千多应届毕业生积极准备参加祖国建设
    首都各高等学校六千多名应届毕业生正紧张进行考试或参加生产实习，积极准备踏上祖国的各种建设岗位。其中有一部分学生已经结束了他们的学习生活，满怀热情地接受了国家分配给他们的工作。
    北京钢铁工业学院的一百二十多个毕业生已经分别到鞍山钢铁公司等处参加了祖国的建设。他们都表示要做好人民交给他们的工作。北京地质学院地球物理探矿专修科学生牛家璧被分配到新疆，他愉快地说：祖国需要我到那里，我就到那里工作。
    毕业生中有百分之三十五以上是工科学生，其中有祖国迫切需要的掌握电炉熔炼专门技术的人才，有石油炼制、暖气通风等各种专门人才，也有具有工厂管理等各方面专业知识的干部。中国人民大学为祖国输送了第一批外交、法律等系的毕业生。此外，毕业生中还有未来的教师和医师。
    今年毕业生中有一部分是工农干部。中国人民大学正举行毕业考试的二千二百七十九名毕业生中，百分之五十八点六是工农干部，百分之六十七以上是共产党员和青年团员。他们由于能刻苦钻研，认真学习，都获得比较良好的成绩，上学期考试各科平均都在四分以上。
    毕业生们都参加过生产实习，有的还作过课程设计。北京钢铁工业学院的毕业生们在实习时炼出的各种合金结构钢，经检验后认为完全合格。清华大学本届六百五十多个毕业生，百分之八十以上都获得了“优秀”和“良好”的成绩。（新华社）
