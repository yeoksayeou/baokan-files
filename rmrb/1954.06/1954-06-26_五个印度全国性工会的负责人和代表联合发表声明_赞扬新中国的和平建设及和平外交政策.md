We are convinced that China, which has suffered decades of imperialist rule and oppression, has no territorial ambitions; therefore, she sincerely hopes for and respects the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of all fraternal countries on the Asian continent, and believes that the progress, peace, and happiness of Asia and the world lies entirely in the peaceful coexistence of all countries."

The statement concludes: "We are deeply moved by the Chinese people's sincere and friendly attitude towards the Indian people, which clearly shows their sincere desire for a solid friendship between India and China and other Asian countries."

    五个印度全国性工会的负责人和代表联合发表声明
    赞扬新中国的和平建设及和平外交政策
    据新华社讯：应邀来我国参加“五一”节观礼和访问的五个印度全国性工会的负责人和代表，在结束了访问活动后，联合发表声明，叙述他们对新中国的观感。在这件声明上署名的是：印度统一工会大会理事会理事西席尔·罗伊，印度全国铁路员工联合会执行委员南达拉朱·拉加文德拉·拉奥，全印总工会拉贾斯坦省工会书记维·维·乔希，全印银行雇员协会主席贝诺伊·罗伊，全印糖业工人联合会主席希·萨克森纳，印度统一工会大会代表西雅伯哈里·萨伦。
    这件声明中首先写到“五一”节观礼给予极为深刻的印象是，新中国正团结一致地坚决地和尽职地向和平与幸福迈进。
    接着叙述了在各工业中心区参观时，看到了新中国在很短时期内取得的巨大成就，看到了中国工人为建设社会主义祖国进行创造性的劳动，以及国家把工人健康、福利事业作为首要关怀的事务而作出的各种设施。他们与中国工人接触中确认“世界工人团结万岁！”这个口号已成为中国工人的信念。
    这件声明里还写到中国人民为和平、进步而真诚奋斗的情形，它说：“新中国在争取世界和平与进步的努力通过各种方式和方法表现了出来，而每一个努力都是一个前进的步骤来动员中国人民，把他们的力量导向建立持久和平的工作，通过持久和平的建立，他们才能够建设他们的工业，实现他们争取人民经济发展的各种计划和他们在社会主义秩序中的幸福。
    “我们相信，新中国正在为和平解决它与世界各国间的一切问题而努力。我们认为并深信中国是真诚相信和平方法，而且将抵抗来自任何方面的侵略。
    “我们完全同意中国人民的愿望：日内瓦会议应该获得成功，以便为和平解决讨论中的问题铺平道路，使曾经是帝国主义与殖民主义剥削与侵略的逐鹿场所的亚洲，在至少遭受了几世纪的痛苦以后能够在自由与和平的空气中解决自己的问题。我们确信，受了几十年的帝国主义统治和压迫的中国不会有领土的野心，因此，她真挚地希望和尊重亚洲大陆上各兄弟国家的领土完整与国家主权，而且相信亚洲和世界的进步、和平与幸福完全在于各国的和平共处。”
    声明接着叙述他们到达北京时，获得中印两国签订关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定的消息，认为这个协定是在互相尊重主权和领土完整的基础上签订的。并认为采用了协商和协议的方法，印度和中国已经在世界历史上增加了一个光辉的篇章，这就是说：每一问题都可以用互相信任和诚意来得到解决。
    声明里写到五月五日至八日他们在北京参加的亚洲工会友谊座谈会时，认为这是对亚洲工人阶级和工会具有历史意义的重要事件。声明说：“我们参加座谈的印度工会代表对我们的决定意见是一致的，为亚洲工会代表会议的伟大愿望的成功而努力。”
    声明最后写道：“我们深为中国人民对印度人民的诚挚友好的态度所感动，这清楚地显示了他们对印度和中国以及和其他亚洲国家之间的牢固的友好关系的真诚愿望。”
