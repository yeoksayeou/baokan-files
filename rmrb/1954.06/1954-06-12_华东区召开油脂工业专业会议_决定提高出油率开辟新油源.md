The East China Local Industry Bureau convened the East China Oil Industry Professional Conference from May 25th to June 5th. The conference emphasized the significant importance of increasing oil production. It was generally agreed that, under the current circumstances, the most crucial tasks are to tap the potential of factories, increase oil extraction rates, and widely utilize all possible raw materials to increase oil production through various means. The conference believed that if the average oil extraction rate per 100 catties of raw materials could be increased by 2.5 percentage points on the existing basis, the oil production in the entire East China region could be increased by more than 10%. Currently, the oil extraction rate of soybeans in more advanced factories has reached over 13% to 14%, while the average in most factories is still only around 11%; for peanuts, the oil extraction rate in advanced factories has reached 44% to 45%, while the average in general factories is still below 40%. Therefore, it is entirely possible to increase the average oil extraction rate by more than 2.5 percentage points this year.

During group discussions, various factories first examined and criticized their past relaxation of technical leadership and complacency with existing achievements. Based on the Li Chuanjiang oil pressing method and advanced experiences from various sources, they initially summarized operational methods for various types of oil pressing equipment. The conference also discussed processing fee policies, raw material allocation, and raw material storage issues. Regarding expanding the utilization of various oil crops, the conference listened to experimental reports on silkworm pupae oil extraction and specifically studied the issue of rice bran oil extraction and using soybean cakes to make tofu.

    华东区召开油脂工业专业会议
    决定提高出油率开辟新油源
    华东地方工业局于五月二十五日到六月五日，召开了华东油脂工业专业会议。会议着重指出了油脂增产的重大意义。大家认为按照目前情况，发掘工厂潜在能力，提高出油率，及广泛利用各种可能利用的原料，用各种办法增加油脂产量，是当前最主要的任务。会议认为如果在现有的基础上，每百斤原料平均提高出油率百分之二点五，则华东全区的油脂产量就可增加百分之十以上。现在大豆的出油率，比较先进的工厂已在百分之十三到十四以上，而多数厂平均还只达到百分之十一左右；花生出油率，先进工厂已达到百分之四十四到四十五，而一般厂平均还在百分之四十以下。因此，今年要求平均把出油率提高百分之二点五以上是完全可能的。
    在小组讨论中，各厂首先检查和批判了以往放松技术领导和满足已有成绩的自满情绪，并根据李川江榨油法和各方面的先进经验，初步总结了各种不同榨油设备的操作法。会议还讨论了工缴政策、原料分配和原料保管问题。在扩大利用各种油料作物方面，会议听取了蚕蛹浸油等试验报告，并专门研究了米糠榨油问题和豆饼做豆腐问题。
