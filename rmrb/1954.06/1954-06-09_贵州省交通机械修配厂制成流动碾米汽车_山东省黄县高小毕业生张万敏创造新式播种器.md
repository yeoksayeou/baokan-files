    Mobile Rice Milling Truck Manufactured by Guizhou Provincial Transportation Machinery Repair Plant
    New-Style Seeder Created by Zhang Wanmin, Graduate of Huang County Senior Primary School, Shandong Province

    Workers at the Guizhou Provincial Transportation Machinery Repair Plant have manufactured a mobile rice milling truck for the peasants. From removing the rice husks to producing cooked rice, the entire process is mechanized and requires only two people to operate. It can mill 3,800 jin of paddy into cooked rice per hour, equivalent to the output of 380 peasants using foot-operated mortars. This rice milling truck, painted with the striking red slogan "Bring the raw materials to the factory, bring the machines to the farm," will soon be traveling on the highways, serving the peasants of all nationalities.

    Zhang Wanmin, a graduate of Danjia Village Senior Primary School in Huang County, Shandong Province, has recently created a new-style seeder. Preliminary tests at the Huang County Farm show good results. The Shandong Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry is studying its use and preparing to promote it.

    This new-style seeder incorporates features from local plows, harrows, and seed drills, integrating them into a successful design. It can perform row seeding, equidistant point seeding, and wide-row dense planting for crops such as wheat, corn, and beans. It can also separate seeds and fertilizer during planting. At the same time, it speeds up planting and greatly reduces labor.

    According to calculations: using old farm tools for wide-row dense planting of wheat requires seventeen laborers per ten mu of land (including animal power conversion). Using this new-style seeder to plant ten mu requires only five laborers (including animal power conversion). Planting corn with old farm tools requires ten laborers per ten mu of land, while this new-style seeder requires only three and a half laborers per ten mu. Huang County plants a total of 480,000 mu of wheat and 200,000 mu of corn. If this seeder were used for all of it, the county could save 700,600 labor days, while the cost of manufacturing one new-style seeder is only 300,000 yuan.

    The local Party committee and government highly value the creation of Senior Primary School graduate Zhang Wanmin. The Laiyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Youth League sent a letter congratulating him, praising his spirit of diligent study and overcoming difficulties.

    贵州省交通机械修配厂制成流动碾米汽车
    山东省黄县高小毕业生张万敏创造新式播种器
    贵州省交通机械修配厂职工，为农民制造了一部流动碾米汽车。从脱谷壳到出熟米，全用机器操作，只要两个人掌握，每小时就可把三千八百斤谷子碾成熟米，相当于三百八十个农民的手脚臼米。这部漆着“把原料送到工厂，把机器带给农庄”的鲜红大字的碾米汽车，不久就要行驶在公路线上，为各族农民服务。　（本报西南记者站）×××
    山东省黄县单家村高小毕业生张万敏，最近创造了一种新式播种器。经黄县农场初步试验，效果良好。山东省人民政府农林厅正在研究准备推广。
    这架新式播种器是吸取了当地犁、耙、耧等旧式农具的特点，加以综合制造成功的。它能做到小麦、玉米、豆子等作物的条播、等距点播和宽幅密植。下种时也可以做到种籽与肥料分开。同时，播种迅速，劳动力大大减省。
    据计算：用旧农具宽垅密植种小麦，每十亩地需要十七个劳动力（畜力折合在内），用这种新式播种器种十亩地，只需要五个劳动力（畜力折合在内）。用旧农具种玉米，每十亩地需要十个劳动力，若用这种新式播种器，每十亩地只需三个半劳动力。全黄县共种小麦四十八万亩，种玉米二十万亩，假若都使用这种播种器，全县可节省七十万零六千个劳动日，而制造一具新式播种器所需的费用，只要三十万元。
    对高小毕业生张万敏的创造，当地党委和政府极为重视。青年团莱阳地委特写信向他祝贺，表扬他的刻苦钻研、克服困难的精神。
