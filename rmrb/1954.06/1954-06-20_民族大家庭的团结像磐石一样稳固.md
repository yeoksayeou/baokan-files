The unity of Our National Family is as Solid as a Rock
Fei Xiaotong, Vice President of the Central Institute for Nationalities

    I wholeheartedly support the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China promulgated by the Central People's Government Committee. I also fully believe that the more than forty million people of all minority nationalities across the country will enthusiastically cheer and sing for this Draft Constitution, which consolidates our great family of freedom and equality for all nationalities.
    Free and equal relations between nationalities are a new thing in our history, an achievement gained through the long-term common struggle of all nationalities. Without the victory of the people's revolution, it would have been impossible to form a national family of friendship and mutual assistance. The new atmosphere of joy and prosperity among all nationalities since the founding of the People's Republic of China nearly five years ago has fully demonstrated that only in a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance can minority nationalities break free from oppression and poverty and begin to advance towards a brighter socialist society.
    Our Draft Constitution stipulates that all nationalities are equal. Within the territory of the People's Republic of China, ethnic discrimination and oppression are no longer allowed, and acts that undermine the unity between nationalities shall be prohibited. Citizens of any nationality are equal before the law, and everyone jointly enjoys the rights and obligations stipulated by the Constitution, standing shoulder to shoulder, with friendship and mutual assistance, to build our great socialist country.
    Our Draft Constitution also stipulates that the freedom of all nationalities is guaranteed. All nationalities have their own spoken and written languages, customs, and religious beliefs. People of all nationalities are free to develop their own spoken and written languages, and are free to maintain or reform their own customs and religious beliefs. People of other nationalities shall not interfere or force them to do so. This is necessary because it is the right of all fraternal nationalities within an equal national family, and only by respecting each other's characteristics can the unity between nationalities be consolidated and strengthened.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the ethnic policies of Chairman Mao have been implemented, regional autonomy has been implemented in areas where minority nationalities live in concentrated communities, and all nationalities have become masters of their own affairs, establishing free and equal relations between nationalities. National regional autonomy is regional autonomy within the territory of the People's Republic of China and under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government. All national autonomous areas are inseparable parts of the country. We are a multi-ethnic country, but also a unified country. Within this unified country, all minority nationalities can continuously receive assistance from fraternal nationalities, and advance equally and freely towards the same goal, jointly building a beautiful new life.
    Our Draft Constitution points out that all nationalities must enter a prosperous and happy socialist society. Of course, each nationality has different needs in the construction process, and each nationality has different characteristics in development. Our Draft Constitution meticulously takes into account the particularities of all nationalities, so that all nationalities can adopt specific measures suitable to their own national characteristics in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the people of their own nationality.
    For thousands of years, the common wish of the ancestors of all minority nationalities has been stipulated in our Draft Constitution; the happy future of future generations has also been presented in our Draft Constitution. Songs are coming from all directions from the high mountains and ridges, deep jungles, vast grasslands, remote frontiers, and every corner of the great motherland. Dozens of languages, tens of millions of voices, will all cheer and sing for the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The unity of our national family is as solid as a rock, and the future of our country is bright. Let the people of all our nationalities work together to support this Draft Constitution.

    民族大家庭的团结像磐石一样稳固
    中央民族学院副院长  费孝通
    我竭诚拥护中央人民政府委员会所公布的中华人民共和国宪法草案。我也充分相信全国四千多万少数民族人民一定会热烈地为这个巩固我们各民族自由平等的大家庭的宪法草案而欢呼高唱。
    自由平等的民族关系，在我国历史上是一件新的事情，是各民族人民长期共同奋斗所得来的成果。没有人民革命的胜利，友爱互助的民族大家庭是不可能形成的。中华人民共和国建国近五年以来，各民族欢欣鼓舞，日趋繁荣的新气象，已经充分证明，只有在以工人阶级为领导，以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家里，少数民族人民才能摆脱压迫和贫困，开始向更光明的社会主义社会前进。
    我们的宪法草案中规定各民族一律平等。在中华人民共和国境内，不允许再有民族歧视和压迫，破坏各民族间团结的行为要受到禁止。不论那一个民族的公民，在法律面前都是平等的，大家共同地享受着宪法所规定的权利和义务，齐肩并立，友爱互助，一起来建设我们伟大的社会主义国家。
    我们的宪法草案也规定保证各民族的自由。各民族都有自己的语言文字，自己的风俗习惯和宗教信仰。各民族人民都可以自由地发展自己的语言文字，都可以自由地保持或改革自己的风俗习惯和宗教信仰，其他民族的人不能加以干涉或强制。这是必要的，因为这是平等的民族大家庭之内各兄弟民族应有的权利，而且只有大家互相尊重各民族的特点，民族间的团结才能巩固和加强。
    自从中华人民共和国成立以来，执行了毛主席的民族政策，各少数民族聚居的地方实行了区域自治，各民族自己当家作主，建立了自由平等的民族关系。民族区域自治是在中华人民共和国领土之内的，在中央人民政府统一领导之下的区域自治。各个民族自治地方都是国家不可分离的部分。我们是一个多民族国家，同时也是一个统一的国家。各少数民族在这个统一的国家内，可以不断地得到兄弟民族的帮助，平等地、自由地向着同一目标前进，共同建设美好的新生活。
    我们的宪法草案指出，各民族都要进入繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。当然，各民族在建设过程中各有不同的需要，各民族在发展上又各有不同的特点。我们的宪法草案无微不至的照顾到了各民族的特殊性，使各民族都能按照本民族大多数人的意愿，采取适合于自己民族特点的具体措施。
    各少数民族人民几千年来，列祖列宗的共同愿望，在我们宪法草案中规定下来了；子子孙孙的幸福前途，也在我们宪法草案中呈现出来了。歌声从高山峻岭，丛林深谷，广阔的草原，遥远的边疆，伟大祖国的每一个角落里，四面八方地传来，几十种语言，几千万个声音，将一齐为中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导而欢呼高唱。我们民族大家庭的团结已经像磐石一样稳固，我们国家的前途光芒万丈。让我们各民族人民齐心协力拥护这个宪法草案。
