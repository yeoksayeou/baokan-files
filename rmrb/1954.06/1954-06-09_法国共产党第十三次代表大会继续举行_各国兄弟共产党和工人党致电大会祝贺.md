Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 7th: According to TASS, the Thirteenth Congress of the French Communist Party continued its sessions on the 5th.

    Representatives of the French Communist Party's provincial committees spoke one by one from the rostrum. The entire process of the congress was permeated with the idea that the French working class must unite and must unite all genuine patriotic and national forces in the country that demand a change in the current policy of the French government around the working class. The representatives cited convincing facts to prove that the Communist Party's ideological influence on the broad masses of the people was strengthening and the Party's organizational foundation was consolidating.

    The representatives listened with great attention to the speech by Waldeck Rochet, in which he spoke about the situation of French farmers and the tasks of the Communist Party in rural areas. He said: French agriculture is currently in a difficult period. The purchasing power of farmers has greatly declined. The value of imported agricultural products was 125 billion francs in 1950, and increased to 560 billion francs in 1953. The volume of French agricultural exports fell from 140 billion francs in 1951 to 83 billion francs in 1953.

    Rochet elaborated on ways to revitalize agriculture, saying that farmers understand that only by completely changing the policy and only by forming a close alliance with the working class to struggle can their demands be met.

    Fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties from various countries sent telegrams to congratulate the congress. The famous French patriot Henri Martin read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party. The telegram stated that the Vietnamese people have been paying close attention to the French people's struggle against the continuation of the Indochina War and highly appreciate their efforts in this regard. When this was read, the delegates applauded warmly. The congress, with applause expressing friendship, agreed with Martin's view that the best response to this congratulatory telegram from the Vietnam Workers' Party is for the French people to intensify their struggle for a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue.

    When Laurent Casanova stepped onto the stage to read the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the congress, the entire audience cheered. The CPC Central Committee's congratulatory telegram wished the French people greater success in their struggle to win national independence and to stop the Indochina War. After reading the congratulatory telegram, Casanova called on French Communists to step up their efforts to strive for the recognition of the People's Republic of China and to strive for its entry into the United Nations.

    Victor Michaud read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, signed by Wilhelm Pieck. Van Hoorick, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party, conveyed congratulations to the congress on behalf of the Belgian Communist Party.

    In the evening session on the 5th, François Billoux gave a report on "The Communist Party and Youth." Billoux emphasized that without the active participation of young people, the Communist Party cannot expect to successfully complete its task of safeguarding French national independence and peace. Underestimating the youth movement is an obstacle on the road of the Communist Party's national policy.

    Billoux gave a detailed analysis of the situation of French youth, pointing out that policies that undermine French national independence and the French economy have severely impacted the position of young people. Young people are trying to break free from the predicament that France's temporary rulers are trying to force them into.

    Billoux then spoke about the communist principles of organizing young people. He said that the Communist Party is the vanguard of the working class, and the responsibility for uniting the younger generation rests on its shoulders.

    Billoux emphasized that it is necessary to take into account the special demands and desires of young people and be good at meeting these demands, and it is necessary to ensure correct education for young people. He pointed out that it is necessary to wage a tenacious struggle against bourgeois ideology in any form that appears in youth organizations. Billoux said that the Party's responsibility to young people is to find out the real reasons for the current situation of young people, educate them and inspire them to recognize the prospects of their struggle, and help them organize and participate in the struggle.

    Billoux called for making every effort to expand and consolidate the Republican Youth Federation of France and the French Young Women's Federation, and emphasized that the Communist Party should help youth organizations establish broad ties with the youth organizations of socialists and Catholics. Billoux said: The most important thing is to organize young people to fight for peace and for French national independence and security.

    Billoux concluded by saying that young workers should play a decisive role in the struggle to establish a close alliance with young farmers. Party organizations at all levels and all party members are responsible for doing everything possible to help the National Youth Festival, which will be held from July 10th to 14th, to be successfully carried out.

    法国共产党第十三次代表大会继续举行
    各国兄弟共产党和工人党致电大会祝贺
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党第十三次代表大会五日继续举行会议。
    法国共产党各省委员会的代表一个一个地在讲坛上讲了话。代表大会的整个过程贯穿着这样一种思想：法国工人阶级必须团结起来，必须把全国一切要求改变法国政府现行政策的真正的爱国力量和民族力量团结在工人阶级的周围。代表们列举了一些令人信服的事实，证明共产党对广大人民群众的思想影响是加强了，党的组织基础是巩固了。
    代表们极其注意地听取了瓦德克·罗歇的发言，他谈到法国农民的境况以及共产党在农村中的任务。他说道：法国的农业现正处在一个艰难的时期。农民的购买力是大大低落了。一九五零年进口的农产品价值为一千二百五十亿法郎，而到一九五三年增加到五千六百亿法郎。法国农产品的出口量从一九五一年的一千四百亿法郎下降到一九五三年的八百三十亿法郎。
      罗歇阐述了振兴农业的办法，他说，农民们懂得，只有整个地改变政策，只有和工人阶级结成紧密的联盟来进行斗争，他们的要求才能得到满足。
      各国兄弟共产党和工人党都来电向大会祝贺。著名的法国爱国者亨利·马丁宣读越南劳动党中央委员会的贺电。电文中说，越南人民一直极为注意法国人民反对继续印度支那战争的斗争，并对他们在这方面的努力给予很高的评价。读到这里时，大会代表热烈鼓掌。大会以表示友谊的掌声同意马丁的意见：对越南劳动党这一贺电最好的答复是，法国人民加紧为和平解决印度支那问题而斗争。
      当洛朗·加桑诺瓦走上讲台宣读中国共产党中央委员会致大会的贺电时，全场群起欢呼。中共中央的贺电祝法国人民在争取国家独立，争取停止印度支那战争的斗争中获得更大的成就。加桑诺瓦读完贺电后，号召法国共产党员加紧努力，争取承认中华人民共和国、争取使它进入联合国。
    维克托·密肖宣读了由威廉·皮克签字的德国统一社会党中央委员会的贺电。比利时共产党中央委员会书记范胡里克代表比利时共产党向大会致贺。
    在五日的晚间会议上，弗朗索瓦·皮佑作了“共产党和青年”的报告。皮佑着重说，没有青年们的积极参加，共产党就不能指望胜利地完成它面临的保障法国民族独立与和平的任务。对青年运动估计不足是共产党全国政策道路上的障碍。
    皮佑详细地分析了法国青年的情况，并指出破坏法国民族独立和法国经济的政策使青年们的地位遭到严重的打击。青年们正在力图摆脱法国暂时的统治者企图迫使他们走入的绝境。
    皮佑接着谈到关于组织青年的共产主义原则的问题。他说，共产党是工人阶级的先锋队，团结青年一代的责任也就在它的肩上。
    皮佑强调指出，必须考虑到青年的特殊要求和愿望并善于满足这些要求，必须保证对青年进行正确的教育。他指出必须与以任何形式出现在青年组织中的资产阶级思想意识进行顽强的斗争。皮佑说道，党对青年的责任是：找出目前青年处境的真正原因，教育他们和启发他们认识自己斗争的远景，帮助他们组织起来和参加斗争。
    皮佑号召尽一切努力来扩大和巩固法兰西共和青年联盟和法兰西女青年联盟，并着重指出：共产党应当帮助青年组织与社会党人和天主教徒的青年组织建立广泛的联系。皮佑说：最主要的是组织青年们为争取和平，为争取法国民族独立和安全而斗争。
    皮佑最后说道，青年工人应当在争取与青年农民建立密切同盟的斗争中起决定性的作用。各级党组织和全体党员要负责尽一切可能帮助在七月十日至十四日举行的全国青年联欢节得以顺利进行。
