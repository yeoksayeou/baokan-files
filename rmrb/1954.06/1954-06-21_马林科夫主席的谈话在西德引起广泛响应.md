Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, G.M. Malenkov, and Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, O. Grotewohl, held talks on June 11, which aroused a wide response in West Germany. During the talks, Malenkov stated that the Soviet government would give favorable consideration to the requests made by relevant parties in West Germany regarding the establishment of economic and cultural relations between West Germany and the Soviet Union.

    Upon learning of this talk, legal experts and experts on Eastern affairs at the Bonn Foreign Ministry immediately submitted a report on June 14, urging the Adenauer government to establish economic and cultural ties with the Soviet Union and to consult with the relevant committees of the German Democratic Republic. These experts at the Bonn Foreign Ministry also suggested authorizing the Eastern Committee of the West German Economic Committee to sign trade agreements with the Soviet Union and to immediately lift the restrictions on the representatives of the Eastern Committee traveling to the Soviet Union.

    The Eastern Committee of the West German Economic Committee announced on June 14 that the representatives going to the Soviet Union "will meet with Adenauer this week and will firmly declare that they are not prepared to abandon their plan to go to Moscow." The Chairman of the Federation of German Industries, Berg, also expressed dissatisfaction in a letter to Adenauer regarding the Bonn authorities' restrictions on the representatives of the Eastern Committee traveling to Moscow.

    In addition, the German Social Democratic Party issued a statement on June 13, also expressing "welcome to the establishment of normal relations with the Soviet Union." Koch, the state election candidate of the North Rhine-Westphalia state of the German Social Democratic Party, said at the state election conference held in Bielefeld this week: "For us, friendship with the Soviet Union is more important than friendship with the United States."

    马林科夫主席的谈话在西德引起广泛响应
    据新华社讯：柏林消息：苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫和德意志民主共和国总理奥·格罗提渥六月十一日的谈话在西德引起了广泛的响应。在这次谈话中，马林科夫曾表示苏联政府将善意地考虑西德有关人士提出的关于西德和苏联建立经济与文化关系的要求。
    波恩外交部的法律专家和东方专家得知这个谈话后，于六月十四日即在报告中提请阿登纳政府和苏联建立经济与文化联系，并和德意志民主共和国的有关委员会进行商讨。波恩外交部的这些专家还建议授权西德经济委员会的东方委员会和苏联签订贸易协定，并立刻撤销对东方委员会的代表赴苏联的限制。
    西德经济委员会的东方委员会于六月十四日公布的消息说，赴苏代表们“将于本星期去见阿登纳，并将坚定地宣布他们不准备放弃他们赴莫斯科的计划”。联邦工业家联合会主席柏格在致阿登纳的信中，也对波恩当局限制东方委员会的代表赴莫斯科一事表示不满。
    此外，德国社会民主党于六月十三日发表声明，也表示“欢迎和苏联建立正常的关系”。德国社会民主党北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州州选举候选人柯赫于本星期在俾雷腓尔德举行的州选举大会上说：“对我们来说，和苏联友好比和美国友好更为重要。”
