    Li Zhongfang Creates New Blasting Method
    Increasing Quarrying Efficiency Twentyfold

    Li Zhongfang, the captain of the Fifth Team of the Second Sand and Gravel Collection Yard of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, created a "jar blasting method" for opening mountains and quarrying stone, increasing work efficiency by more than twenty times. This method is now being widely promoted at the Second Sand and Gravel Collection Yard.

    The yard's mountain opening work originally used the old blasting method, with each blast only able to collapse one or two cubic meters of stone, resulting in very low efficiency. Now that the demand for ballast is very high, Li Zhongfang used his brains to find a knack, starting with thinking about drilling blast holes, and finally came up with a method. This method is: to expand the middle or bottom of the blast hole, and load more explosives, so that the mouth of the hole is small, and the "belly" of the hole is large. If it explodes, the mouth of the hole is small, blocking the explosive force from coming out, which will blast down a lot of stone. He further improved the working method, and the test results were quite good. Each blast can blast down more than forty cubic meters of rubble, increasing work efficiency by more than twenty times, and greatly saving yellow explosives. Now, the jar blasting method has been widely promoted in the yard. (He Wenzhuo)

    李仲芳创造新爆破法
    提高采石效率二十倍
    铁道部第三工程局第二砂石采集场第五小队队长李仲芳，创造用“坛子炮爆破法”开山采石，工作效率提高二十多倍，现在已在第二砂石采集场普遍推广。
    该场的开山工作，原来是用旧法爆破，一炮仅能崩一两方石头，效率很低。现在道碴需用量很大，李仲芳就动脑筋，找窍门，先从打炮眼想起，终于想出了一个办法。这个办法就是：把炮眼当中或底部扩大，多装些药，这样炮口小，炮肚大，如果一爆炸，炮口小，堵住药力出不来，这样就会炸下很多石头来。他又进一步改进工作方法，试验结果，效果相当好，每炮均能炸下四十多立方片石，工作效率提高二十多倍，黄炸药也大大节省了。现在，坛子炮已在该场普遍推广。　　（何文焯）
