Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 13th: The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant has reconstructed an open-hearth furnace into an automated one. The reconstruction of this furnace began on May 2nd, and with the guidance of Soviet experts and the efforts of construction workers, the first batch of molten steel was produced at 4:00 PM on June 10th. The steel produced by this automated open-hearth furnace is estimated to increase by ten to fifteen percent compared to before the reconstruction, while the number of steelworkers required will be reduced by more than twenty percent.

During the reconstruction, the furnace was equipped with an automatic furnace roof temperature measuring device and an automatic regenerator temperature measuring device for gas and air. This means that steelworkers no longer have to stand in front of the hot furnace door to observe the furnace roof temperature with their naked eyes or go to the regenerator to measure the temperature with a thermometer. They can accurately grasp the temperature of the open-hearth furnace by simply observing the automatic instruments in the control room. The furnace is also equipped with automatic regulators for gas and air flow. These devices can ensure a normal supply of heat, preventing abnormal situations of excessively high or low temperatures. Currently, workers are beginning to install electric devices for opening and closing the furnace doors to replace the previous method of controlling the doors manually and mechanically. After installing these automation devices on the open-hearth furnace, steelworkers can concentrate all their energy on steelmaking, without being distracted by other auxiliary work. It will also allow them to improve their smelting techniques more quickly and improve the quality of the steel.

    鞍钢炼钢厂一座自动化平炉已经改建成功
    钢的产量估计可以提高百分之十到百分之十五
   【新华社鞍山十三日电】鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂已把一座平炉改建成为自动化平炉。这座平炉自五月二日开始改建，在苏联专家的指导和建筑工人的努力下，到六月十日下午四时，已炼出了第一炉钢水。这座自动化平炉出产的钢，估计可比改建以前提高百分之十到百分之十五，炼钢工人却要比以前减少百分之二十以上。
    这座平炉在改建中，安装了炉顶温度自动测定器、煤气与空气蓄热室温度自动测定器，这样，炼钢工人就可不必经常站在火热的炉门前，凭肉眼观察炉顶的温度或拿着测温器到蓄热室测定温度。他们只要站在操纵室观察自动计器，就能正确掌握平炉的温度。平炉上还装置了煤气流量和空气流量的自动调节器。这些设备能保证热量的正常供应，不致形成温度过高或过低的不正常情况。目前，工人们又开始安装开闭炉门的电动装置，以代替过去用人力和机械控制炉门的办法。平炉上安装这些自动化设备后，可以使炼钢工人集中全部精力炼钢，不必分心照管其他辅助工作，并且还能更快地提高工人的冶炼技术，提高钢的质量。
