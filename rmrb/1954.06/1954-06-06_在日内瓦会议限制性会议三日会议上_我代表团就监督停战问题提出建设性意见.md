Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 3rd. A special correspondent of this agency reports: According to information received here, the restricted session of the nine-nation delegations discussing the Indochina issue continued on the 3rd to exchange views on the issue of supervising the cessation of hostilities in Indochina.

It is reported that the Chinese delegation put forward constructive opinions on the issue of ceasefire supervision at the meeting.

As previously reported, the issue of the relationship between the Mixed Supervisory Committee and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has caused great controversy in past meetings. Regarding this issue, the Chinese delegation believes that the scope of authority and the relationship between the two organizations can be determined with reference to the experience of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The two organizations have parallel divisions of labor and are related to each other, and neither organization is above the other, let alone the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission above the Mixed Supervisory Committee. This is because the responsibility of the Mixed Supervisory Committee is to be responsible for the implementation of the ceasefire terms; the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is responsible for supervising whether both parties have violated the ceasefire terms.

People know that in past meetings, some delegations deliberately downplayed the importance of the Mixed Supervisory Committee. In their view, it seems that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should bear the main responsibility for supervising the ceasefire. Regarding this point, the Chinese delegation pointed out that in the Indochina ceasefire, the belligerent parties are the main body. Whether the ceasefire agreement can be reached and implemented depends on whether both parties have sincerity. Since the Mixed Committee includes both parties, it should bear the main responsibility. According to the Chinese delegation's opinion, the task of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should have two aspects: on the one hand, to monitor the demilitarized zone separating the two sides within Indochina; on the other hand, to supervise the cessation of the entry of any new troops, military personnel, weapons, and ammunition from outside the country into the entire Indochina and the border (whether sea, land, or air) bordering various countries. The Chinese delegation believes that both the Mixed Supervisory Committee and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission work in the demilitarized zone, while the supervision of the border areas is directly carried out by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that the latter task is the main task of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

At the meeting, some people said that international supervision should be different in Cambodia and Laos than in Vietnam. In particular, the representative of the Kingdom of Cambodia said that they could not fulfill the obligation to stop the import of new troops and military supplies from outside the country. The Chinese delegation cannot agree with this. The Chinese delegation believes that this opinion is to allow foreign countries, specifically the United States, to establish military bases in Cambodia, threatening peace in Indochina. How can this guarantee a ceasefire? Therefore, this kind of opinion cannot be agreed with.

Regarding the question of who the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be responsible to, the Chinese delegation believes that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be responsible to the nine countries participating in this conference and who will soon participate in the international guarantee. If there are violations of the agreement that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission cannot handle, it should be submitted to the countries participating in the guarantee for joint discussion to seek collective measures to resolve these problems.

Regarding the definition of neutral countries, there have been various interpretations at the meeting. The Chinese delegation believes that this should be interpreted in accordance with Article 37 of the Korean Armistice Agreement, that is: countries that have not participated in the war are neutral countries; if judged by political ideology, then there will be no neutral countries in the world.

At the meeting, some people advocated that the United Nations should bear the responsibility of supervising the ceasefire. The Chinese delegation disagreed with this view. The Chinese delegation pointed out that the Geneva Conference has nothing to do with the United Nations. Forcibly bringing up the United Nations will only complicate the issue and will not be beneficial. Moreover, there are currently people attempting to expand interference in the Indochina war, attempting to bring the Indochina issue to the United Nations for discussion. Under these circumstances, if the United Nations is responsible for supervising the ceasefire in Indochina, there will inevitably be no good results.

At today's meeting, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also pointed out that as long as the parties concerned truly hope to cease hostilities, it should not be difficult to supervise the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. Therefore, both France and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam should have the right and responsibility to implement and supervise the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. There is nothing to object to this. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is willing to assume this responsibility, and the question is whether France is also willing to do so. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam raised the question: Why should France give up its responsibility to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission? The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declared that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sincerely hopes for peace. Once it signs the ceasefire agreement, it will implement it. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is prepared to assume the responsibility of implementing and supervising the implementation of the ceasefire agreement; at the same time, it does not underestimate a truly neutral international supervisory body, which should be particularly responsible for supervising the cessation of the transport of troops and military supplies from abroad.

It is reported that when the Bao Dai representative proposed at the meeting that the United Nations should supervise the ceasefire, the US representative also said that the United Nations was "most suitable" to undertake this task, but perhaps even they themselves knew that this proposal was too unsightly. Therefore, the US delegation also stated that it did not necessarily advocate doing so. The French delegation believes that the United Nations' efforts to maintain peace are sometimes successful, sometimes not very successful, and sometimes not successful at all. The French delegation did not advocate that the United Nations directly supervise the ceasefire, but it advocated that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be responsible to the United Nations. It is worth noting that many Western newspapers have also recently believed that it would not be a good result for the United Nations to interfere in the Indochina issue. The French "Paris Radical News" said: "Resorting to the United Nations will create a dangerous precedent."

Even before the third meeting was held, Western newspapers widely rumored that Western countries had disagreements among themselves on the issue of the members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. According to the information already obtained, during the adjournment of today's meeting, the representatives of Western countries also conducted tense consultations together, but this does not seem to have yielded any results. Neither the US representative nor the French representative were able to put forward any specific suggestions on the issue of the members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in their speeches.

It is reported that the chairman of today's meeting announced at the end of the meeting: the issue of the members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission will be negotiated outside the meeting by the two chairmen of the meeting.

### 在日内瓦会议限制性会议三日会议上  我代表团就监督停战问题提出建设性意见

    在日内瓦会议限制性会议三日会议上
    我代表团就监督停战问题提出建设性意见
    【新华社日内瓦三日电】本社特派记者报道：根据此间得到的消息，讨论印度支那问题的九国代表团的限制性会议三日继续就在印度支那停止敌对行动的监督问题交换意见。
    据悉，中国代表团在会议上就停战的监督问题提出了建设性的意见。
    前已报道，在过去几次会议上，混合监督委员会和中立国监察委员会之间的关系问题曾引起很大的争论。关于这个问题，中国代表团认为，两个组织的职权范围和相互关系可以参照朝鲜停战协定的经验加以确定。这两个组织是平行分工而相互有关的，不是这一个组织在那一个组织之上，更非中立国监察委员会应在混合监督委员会之上。因为混合监督委员会的责任是负责停战条款的履行；中立国监察委员会则是负责监督双方有无违反停战条款的行为。
    人们知道，在过去的会议上，有些代表团有意降低混合监督委员会的重要性。在他们看来，似乎应该由中立国监察委员会负担监督停战的主要责任。关于这点，中国代表团指出，在印度支那停战，交战双方是主体，停战协定能否达成和履行，要看双方有无诚意，混合委员会既然包括双方，因此，它应负主要责任。根据中国代表团的意见，中立国监察委员会的任务应该有两方面：一方面是在印度支那境内，对隔开双方的非军事地带进行监察；另一方面是在整个印度支那和各国接壤的边境（不论海、陆、空）监督停止从境外进入任何新的部队、军事人员、武器和弹药。中国代表团认为，在非军事区，混合监督委员会和中立国监察委员会两种组织都进行工作，而边境地区的监督，则由中立国监察委员会直接进行，因此，说后一工作是中立国监察委员会的主要工作乃是合理的。
    在会议上曾有人说，国际监督在高棉、寮国应和越南不同，尤其是高棉王国代表说，不能履行停止从境外输入新的军队和军火这一义务。中国代表团对此不能同意。中国代表团认为，这种意见就是容许外国，具体说就是美国，在高棉建立军事基地，威胁印度支那和平，这如何能保证停战呢？因此，对这种意见是不能同意的。
    关于中立国监察委员会应向谁负责的问题，中国代表团认为，中立国监察委员会应向参加本次会议，并即将参加国际保证的九国负责，如有违反协议的事，中立国监察委员会处理不了，便应提交参加保证的国家共同讨论，寻求集体措施，以解决这些问题。
    关于中立国的定义，在会议上曾有各种不同的解释。中国代表团认为，这应按照朝鲜停战协定第三十七款所规定的那样来解释，就是说：没有参战的国家就是中立国；如果按政治思想意识来判断，那么，世界上就没有中立国了。
    会议上，有人主张由联合国来担负监督停战的责任，中国代表团不同意这种主张。中国代表团指出，日内瓦会议和联合国无关，硬把联合国提出来只会把问题复杂化，不会有好处，何况现在正有人企图对印度支那战争扩大干涉，企图把印度支那问题提到联合国去讨论。在这种情况下，如果由联合国负责监督对印度支那停战，是必然不会有好结果的。
    在今天的会议上，越南民主共和国代表团也指出，只要有关双方真正希望停止敌对行动，就能做到监督停战协定的履行也应是没有困难的。因此，法国和越南民主共和国双方都应获得执行和监督履行停战协定的权利和责任。这一点是没有什么可以反对的。越南民主共和国愿意负起这个责任，问题在于法国是否也愿意这样。越南民主共和国代表团提出这样的问题：为什么法国要放弃自己的责任给中立国监察委员会呢？越南民主共和国代表团宣称，越南民主共和国是一心一意地希望和平的，一旦它签订了停战协定，它就要执行。越南民主共和国是准备负起执行和监督执行停战协定的责任的；同时也不因此低估真正中立的国际监督机构，这个机构特别要负责监督停止从境外运入军队和军火。
    据悉，当保大代表在会议上提出由联合国来监督停战之后，美国代表也说联合国是“最适合”担当这个任务的，可是大概连他们自己也知道，这个主张太见不得人，因此，美国代表团又表示并不一定主张要这样做。法国代表团则认为，联合国在维持和平的努力上有时是成功的，有时成就不大，有时根本没有成就。法国代表团没有主张由联合国来直接监督停战，但是他却主张中立国监察委员会应向联合国负责。值得注意的是，近来不少西方报纸也认为，由联合国来干涉印度支那问题是不会有好的结果的。法国“巴黎激进新闻”说：“求助于联合国将造成一种危险的先例”。
    还在三日会议没有举行以前，西方报纸就盛传西方国家在中立国监察委员会的成员问题上，彼此之间的意见是不一致的。根据已经得到的消息，在今天会议的休会期间，西方国家的代表还在一起进行了紧张的商谈，然而这似乎并没有得出什么结果，无论是美国代表，还是法国代表，在他们的发言中都没有能够就中立国监察委员会的成员问题提出任何具体的建议来。
    据悉，今天会议主席在会议结束时宣布：关于中立国监察委员会的成员问题，将由会议的两个主席设法在会外进行协商。
