Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 23rd: The first group of members of the Republic of Indonesia's delegation to the Indonesian-Dutch negotiations in The Hague, the capital of the Netherlands, left Jakarta by plane on the 22nd, led by Indonesian Foreign Minister Sunarjo.

Indonesian parties and groups issued a joint statement on the Indonesian-Dutch negotiations. The statement pointed out that the Round Table Conference Agreement and the federal relationship between Indonesia and the Netherlands greatly damaged the interests of the Indonesian people. The statement said that the Round Table Conference Agreement and the organizational regulations of the Netherlands-Indonesian Union are just another way for Dutch imperialism and colonialism to maintain their rule over Indonesia and the Indonesian people.

The statement said that the Netherlands, with the support of other imperialist countries and colluding with their agents in Indonesia, is obviously using these agreements to strengthen their position in various fields in Indonesia.

The statement said that the Round Table Conference Agreement and the federal organizational regulations have forced many national enterprises to close down, while many foreign enterprises continue to enjoy their "golden age." These foreign companies plunder hundreds of millions of rupiah in profits from Indonesia every year. The statement said that these foreign capitals have also created many "conspiracy incidents against the Republic" in Indonesia.

The statement said that the Round Table Conference Agreement enabled foreign plantations to regain vast agricultural land in Indonesia, while Indonesian farmers are becoming increasingly impoverished due to lack of land.

The statement demanded the immediate abolition of the Netherlands-Indonesian Union and the swift return of West Irian to Indonesian territory. The statement said that if the Netherlands continues to attempt to delay negotiations, the most effective way is to abolish the Netherlands-Indonesian Union immediately.

More than 30 political parties and mass organizations, including the Indonesian National Party, the Indonesian Communist Party, the Greater Indonesian Unity Party, the Greater Indonesian Party, the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association, the Indonesian General Federation of Trade Unions, and the Indonesian Women's Association, signed the statement.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 23rd: Indonesian public opinion widely believes that the United States' behind-the-scenes activities in preparing for war in the Pacific region are complicating the upcoming Indonesian-Dutch negotiations.

A reporter for "Abadi" (永恒报 - "Eternity Daily") published an article on the 14th discussing the West Irian issue, saying that the West Irian issue is one of the most thorny issues in the Indonesian-Dutch negotiations. The reporter pointed out that the United States is colluding with the Netherlands and Australia to turn Irian Island (i.e., New Guinea Island) into a military base as part of the United States' war preparations plan.

The "Abadi" reporter said that the United States had assured the Netherlands of its support against Indonesia's demand for the return of West Irian, and the Netherlands promised to give the United States the right to establish a huge military base in West Irian as a reward. He also wrote that as early as 1950, the US government had asked Australia to strengthen its "defense" in eastern Irian and requested the Australian army and the US army to establish close relations in Irian.

Indonesian newspapers also revealed that the Netherlands and the United States are using Manueles, who calls himself "Prime Minister of the Republic of South Maluku," to carry out conspiracies. Manueles recently went to Switzerland and proposed to the Australian representative attending the Geneva Conference that he contribute a base for Australia's use. "Dongxing Bao" (东星报 - "East Star Daily") said that Manueles' activities are related to the US attempt to obtain a military base in West Irian.

    印尼各党派就印（尼）荷谈判发表联合声明
    要求取消荷兰—印尼联邦和归还西伊里安
    【新华社雅加达二十三日电】参加在荷兰首都海牙举行的印（尼）荷谈判的印尼共和国代表团首批人员，在印尼外交部部长苏纳约率领下已于二十二日乘飞机离雅加达。
    印尼各党派团体就这次印（尼）荷谈判发表了一个联合声明。声明指出圆桌会议协定和印尼与荷兰的联邦关系大大地损害了印尼人民的利益。声明说，圆桌会议协定和荷兰—印尼联邦组织法规，不过是荷兰帝国主义和殖民主义用来维持对印尼和印尼人民的统治的另一种做法。
    声明说，荷兰显然在其它帝国主义国家支持下和它们在印尼的代理人勾结在一起，利用这些协定来加强它们在印尼各个领域中的地位。
    声明说，圆桌会议协定和联邦组织法规已迫使许多民族企业倒闭，而许多外国企业却继续享受着它们的“黄金时代”。这些外国企业每年从印尼掠夺上亿盾的利润。声明说，这些外国资本还在印尼制造了许多“反对共和国的阴谋事件”。
    声明说，圆桌会议协定使外国种植园能够在印尼重新得到广大的农地，而另一方面印尼农民却因缺乏土地而日益贫困。
    声明要求立即取消荷兰—印尼联邦并尽速把西伊里安归入印尼领土。声明说，假如荷兰继续企图拖延谈判，最有效的办法就是立即自行取消荷兰—印尼联邦。
    签署这个声明的有印尼国民党、印尼共产党、大印尼统一党、大印尼党、印尼回教教师联合会、印尼总工会、印尼妇女协会等三十多个政党和群众团体。
    【新华社雅加达二十三日电】印尼舆论广泛认为，美国在太平洋地区备战的幕后活动正使得将要来临的印（尼）荷谈判复杂化。
    “永恒报”记者十四日发表论述西伊里安问题的文章说，西伊里安问题是印（尼）荷谈判中的最棘手的问题之一。记者指出，美国正在勾结荷兰和澳大利亚把伊里安岛（即新畿内亚岛）变为军事基地，作为美国的备战计划的一部分。
    “永恒报”记者说，美国曾向荷兰保证，支持荷兰反对印尼的收回西伊里安的要求，而荷兰答应给予美国在西伊里安建立庞大军事基地作为报酬。他并写道，早在一九五零年，美国政府就要求澳大利亚加强它在伊里安东部的“防务”，并要求澳大利亚军队和美国军队在伊里安建立密切的关系。
    印尼报纸并揭露荷兰和美国正在利用自称为“南摩鹿加共和国总理”的马纽撤马进行阴谋活动。马纽撤马最近到瑞士向出席日内瓦会议的澳大利亚代表提出了贡献基地给澳大利亚使用的建议。“东星报”说，马纽撤马的活动是和美国企图在西伊里安取得军事基地有关的。
