    The United States and Its Lackeys Must Not Escape Culpability
    By Our Correspondent Wu Wentao
    Behind-the-scenes negotiations are intensely underway between the United States and its vassal states to plot the breakdown of the discussion on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference. At the same time, some bourgeois newspapers in the West are under orders to spread pessimistic sentiments in large quantities, predicting that the conference will break down in the near future.
    Needless to say, the United States is extremely eager for the conference to break down. Syngman Rhee recently clamored again in Seoul, saying that "only force can unify Korea"; he said that he would "march north" as soon as the time was right. The breakdown of the conference would undoubtedly provide Syngman Rhee with such an opportunity. The American delegation in Geneva is impatiently waiting for the day of the breakdown to arrive. They originally expected to realize their good dream last week, but failed; now, they are placing their hopes on this week. News has it that the United States is asking its vassal states to issue a joint declaration this week. The United States hopes that after this declaration is read, the conference can "break down."
    However, things are not developing as the United States had calculated. The efforts made by North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue have frustrated the US plan to break up the conference and have pushed the United States and its vassal states before the court of world opinion.
    As everyone knows, on June 5, in order to break the deadlock artificially created by the United States, North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union unanimously expressed the hope that an agreement could be reached first on various agreed principles, and then the differences of opinion on the specific measures to implement these principles could be discussed in order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. Foreign Minister Molotov also put forward five proposals, which affirmed the achievements made by the conference so far and opened the way for further discussion.
    No one except the United States can deny that the efforts of North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union are an important contribution to advancing the work of the conference. The "Hindustan Times" believed on June 6 that Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech "may help break the deadlock at the Geneva Conference." The French newspaper "Le Monde" reported on June 8 that the Western delegations saw two new conciliatory tendencies in Foreign Minister Nam Il's speech, namely: 1. The possibility of gradually withdrawing troops in stages; 2. Accepting the International Commission to supervise elections throughout Korea. "Le Monde" said that, except for the United States, the reactions of the various representatives seemed to be consistent in the following point: that the solution to the Korean issue had taken a step forward.
    The restricted meeting on the Korean issue, originally scheduled for June 7, was postponed. It is said that the reason was that the Western delegations had to consult their governments on Molotov's proposals. When reporting on this incident on June 9, "Le Monde" said that the reason for actually suspending the restricted meeting was the United States' firm opposition to Molotov's proposals. "The United States believes that excluding the intervention of the United Nations means the complete collapse of the line of defense agreed upon between Washington and Seoul." "Le Monde" said: "However, this irreconcilable attitude of the American delegation cannot prevent most delegations from recognizing that Molotov's plan for the Korean issue provides a valuable method; if people want to use this method, they must study it in depth."
    It can be seen that Molotov's proposal has been generally recognized as a problem-solving method worthy of study. Only after the United States exerted strong pressure on its allies did it force them to come out and reject Molotov's proposal. From June 7 to 11, the American delegation engaged in frequent behind-the-scenes activities, especially using the puppet Pyun Yung-tai to force the allied countries to submit. It can be seen from the existing reports that some of the United States' allies had attempted to put forward some proposals to stabilize the status quo in order to appease their own people. The people of these countries are eager for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue so that their children can go home. However, under the direction of the United States, the South Korean delegation strongly opposed any attempt to stabilize the status quo.
    Under the pressure of the United States, some delegations from Western countries succumbed. Before the meeting on June 11, Reuters reported that the meeting would be a "funeral"; some Western representatives admitted that they would go to the Palais des Nations "with a dispirited and ambivalent expression." From the speeches made at the meeting by these representatives who were assigned to serve as trumpeters in this "funeral," one can understand that there is ample reason for their "ambivalence." Their speeches were nothing more than reciting a set of "formulas" prescribed to them by the United States for breaking up the conference; they knew very well that the reasons they used to oppose Molotov's proposals were untenable, but they still had to succumb to the will of the United States and come out with a brazen face to oppose them, while at the same time wearing a begging look in the hope that world opinion would not condemn them. However, the sympathy of world opinion cannot be obtained by begging or by creating rumors and slander, but by actions. Anyone who refuses to reach an agreement on matters of principle and refuses to further negotiate and discuss the specific steps to implement these principles, no matter what "reasons" he uses, will inevitably bear the serious responsibility for undermining the conference.
    Obviously feeling the weakness of their position, the allies of the United States still demanded that the United States leave them a little face after the so-called "funeral" meeting on June 11. News has it that some countries are considering putting forward some proposals on the issue of international supervision of elections; some countries, on the grounds that the French delegation did not have enough power after the fall of the French cabinet, asked the United States not to break off the negotiations on the Korean issue immediately, but to put it and the Indochina issue together in a "cold storage."
    It can be seen from these reports that Molotov's proposals have disrupted the United States' timetable for eagerly breaking off the negotiations. There is no doubt that North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union will continue to make further efforts in a spirit of consultation to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue; if the United States should "become desperate" and break off the negotiations regardless of everything, then the whole world will rule: it is the United States that deliberately undermined the Geneva Conference's peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and those who follow the United States will not be able to escape their due responsibility.

### 美国和它的仆从决不能逃脱罪责

    美国和它的仆从决不能逃脱罪责
    本报记者　吴文焘
    策划破裂日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论的幕后谈判，正在美国和它的仆从国家之间紧张地进行。与此同时，西方国家的一些资产阶级报纸奉命大量散布悲观论调，预测会议将在最近的将来破裂。
    用不着说，美国是极其希望会议的破裂的。李承晚最近又在汉城叫嚣说，“只有武力才能统一朝鲜”；他说，只待时机一到，他就要“北进”。会议的破裂无疑将给李承晚提供这样一个时机。在日内瓦的美国代表团不耐烦地等待着破裂的日子的到来。他们原来指望在上个星期实现他们的好梦的，但是失败了；现在，他们又把希望放在这个星期。有消息说，美国正在要它的仆从国家在这星期发表一项共同宣言。美国希望在这项宣言宣读以后，会议就可以“破裂”。
    但是事情并不是像美国的如意算盘那样发展的。朝、中、苏三国为谋求和平解决朝鲜问题所作的努力，已经使美国破裂会议的计划受到了挫折，并且把美国和它的仆从国家推到了世界舆论法庭的面前。
    大家知道，六月五日，朝、中、苏三国为了打开美国所人为地制造的僵局，一致表示希望先就各项已获一致的原则问题达成协议，然后就实现这些原则的具体措施上的分歧意见进行讨论，以便和平解决朝鲜问题。莫洛托夫外长并且提出了五项建议，这五项建议肯定了会议迄今为止所已经取得的成就，并为进一步讨论开辟了道路。
    除了美国以外，没有人能够否认朝、中、苏三国的努力是推进会议工作的重要贡献。“印度斯坦时报”在六月六日认为周恩来外长的发言“可能有助于打破日内瓦会议的僵局”。法国“世界报”在六月八日报道说，西方各代表团从南日外务相的发言中看到两个新的调和的倾向，即：一、按阶段逐渐撤退军队的可能性；二、接受国际委员会监察全朝鲜的选举。“世界报”说，除了美国以外，各个不同的代表的反应在下面这一点上似乎是一致的，即：朝鲜问题的解决已向前迈进了一步。
    六月七日原定举行的关于朝鲜问题的限制性会议延期举行了。据说，原因是西方各代表团要就莫洛托夫的建议向它们的政府请示。“世界报”在六月九日报道这件事时说，实际上停止举行限制性会议的原因是美国断然反对莫洛托夫的建议，“美国认为，排斥联合国的干预，就意味着华盛顿和汉城之间协议的防御线的整个崩溃”。“世界报”说：“然而，美国代表团这一不调和的态度，并不能阻止大部分代表团承认莫洛托夫的朝鲜问题方案提供出一个宝贵的办法；假使人们要利用这一办法，就必须深入地进行研究。”
    由此可见，莫洛托夫的建议已经被公认为是值得研究的解决问题的办法，美国只是在对它的盟国施用了强大的压力之后，才迫使它们出来拒绝莫洛托夫的建议。从六月七日到十一日之间，美国代表团进行了频繁的幕后活动，特别利用卞荣泰这个傀儡来迫使各盟国就范。从已有的报道中可以看出，美国的某些盟国曾经企图提出某些稳定现状的建议，以便应付它们本国的人民。这些国家的人民渴望朝鲜问题和平解决，让他们的子弟可以回家。但是在美国指使之下，南朝鲜代表团强烈反对任何稳定现状的企图。
    在美国的压力之下，西方国家的某些代表团屈服了。在六月十一日的会议举行之前，路透社就报道说这次会议将是“葬礼”；某些西方代表承认他们将“无精打采哭笑不得”地去到国联大厦。从这些被指派在这个“葬礼”中担任吹鼓手的代表们在会上所作的发言中，人们可以理解他们之所以“哭笑不得”是完全有理由的。他们的发言只不过是背诵了美国给他们规定了的破裂会议的一套“公式”；他们明明知道他们用来反对莫洛托夫的建议的理由是站不住脚的，可是仍然不得不屈从美国的意志，硬着头皮出来反对，同时又带着一副乞怜的神气希望世界舆论不要谴责他们。但是世界舆论的同情不是依靠祈求或是造谣诽谤可以获得的，而是要以行动来博取的。谁要是拒绝就原则问题达成协议，并拒绝进一步就实现这些原则的具体步骤进行协商和讨论，不论他用的是什么“理由”，都不可避免地要承担破坏会议的严重责任。
    显然由于感觉到自己立场的软弱，美国的盟国在六月十一日的所谓“葬礼”会议以后，仍然在要求美国给它们留下一点面子。有消息说，某些国家正在考虑在国际监察选举问题上提出一些方案；某些国家则以法国内阁倒台以后法国代表团没有足够的权力为理由，要求美国不要立即破裂朝鲜问题的谈判，而将它和印度支那问题一起放进“冷藏库”里去。
    从这些消息可以看出，莫洛托夫的建议已经打乱了急于破裂谈判的美国的时间表。毫无疑问，朝、中、苏三国将继续以协商的精神为谋求和平解决朝鲜问题而作进一步的努力；如果美国竟然“狗急跳墙”，不顾一切地破裂谈判，那末全世界将会裁决：蓄意破坏日内瓦会议和平解决朝鲜问题的是美国，而那些追随美国的人也将不能逃避他们应负的责任。六月十四日
