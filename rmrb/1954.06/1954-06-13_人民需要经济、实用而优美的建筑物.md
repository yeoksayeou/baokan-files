The People Need Economical, Practical, and Beautiful Buildings

Editor's Note: Reader Lin Fan's letter raises an important issue and offers beneficial opinions regarding construction work. Recently, we have also received several letters from other readers reflecting some confusion in architectural artistic thought: Some architects are deeply influenced by the formalism of the European and American bourgeoisie. They do not understand how to promote national traditions, and even despise things of their own nation. They do not understand what socialist realism in architecture means, what the principles of socialist urban development are, and the planning and integrity of socialist cities. Nor do they understand the care for people that architecture should have. They only design based on their own "preferences," resulting in poor buildings like the Lingnan Cultural Relics Palace. Some architects do not understand that national architectural heritage should be critically accepted, and new forms suitable for current needs should be created on this basis. Or, although they are willing to accept excellent national architectural art traditions, they lack the spirit of hard work and cannot grasp the characteristics and laws, so they indiscriminately move out everything from ancient Chinese architecture, selling restorationism under the guise of "national form." In addition, a considerable number of people lack understanding of the consistency of economy, practicality, and aesthetics in architecture, and therefore mistakenly believe that being beautiful requires spending more money, and are unwilling to create more beautiful architectural forms while ensuring economy and practicality. Or they simply pay attention to the artistic treatment of the building's exterior while ignoring practical and economical rationality. In order to solve these problems, our advanced Chinese architects have a responsibility to criticize bourgeois formalist architectural thought; at the same time, discuss how to correctly treat national forms, so that our architects gradually establish socialist realist artistic thought, and make the motherland appear more economical, practical, and beautiful buildings.

Comrade Editor:

I am very pleased to see the photos of the newly completed Shenyang Gymnasium, Northeast Agricultural College, Guangzhou Peasant Movement Institute and other buildings published in newspapers and magazines. They are all very beautiful, have distinctive national styles, and make people feel beautiful, stable, and proud. However, I am also very surprised to find that some very unattractive, and even very ugly, buildings are still appearing in some places.

Now let me take the Lingnan Cultural Relics Palace in Guangzhou as an example! This cultural relics palace includes historical relics halls, aquatic products halls, health halls, agriculture and forestry halls, children's palaces, theaters, skating rinks, and a dozen other buildings. It is a place for patriotic education for the working people and a place for them to rest and play. People who have not been here are very eager to see it, but after seeing these buildings, people will feel that this architecture is too bad.

Originally, a group of public buildings of this nature could have been designed as a complete whole with Chinese-style pavilions, terraces, towers, and halls intertwined. But the architects insisted on bringing American-style and Hong Kong-style "square boxes," "dovecotes," and "streamlined" designs to China. There are columns that are thick at the top and thin at the bottom, which induce a sense of terror; there are balconies that protrude far but are as thin as cicada wings; there are tall towers and circular buildings that are neither beautiful nor able to unify the already very scattered buildings; curved walls are not only large in area and expensive to build, but also impractical and unattractive; "floor-to-ceiling windows" (which originally required electric switches) are so high that ladders cannot reach them, making switching extremely inconvenient; tall central doors and short side doors are juxtaposed, appearing extremely disharmonious... In short, this group of buildings makes people feel abrupt, unstable, stimulating, and peculiar everywhere.

Of course, in architecture, as in other arts, there is no opposition to the coexistence of various styles, and there is no opposition to the absorption of various foreign and national forms; however, it is necessary to require that the various styles of architecture used in a group of buildings appear harmonious and become a whole, and that the secondary buildings should be subordinate to the main body. The architecture of the Lingnan Cultural Relics Palace is obviously not like this. Each of the dozen buildings adopts a different style, not harmonious at all, not organized at all, a jumbled mess, without any sense of priority.

The Chinese people do not like such buildings. An old lady came to a building in the Lingnan Cultural Relics Palace and, after seeing the inverted, top-heavy column, said in fear: "I'm afraid! Will it collapse!" Friends from fraternal countries also do not appreciate this type of architecture. A Polish friend—the designer of the Polish Exhibition—said after seeing some buildings in Guangzhou: "These are like children's building blocks, so ugly!"

We know that the current national economic construction policy is to concentrate major efforts on developing heavy industry. But this does not mean that general non-productive buildings can be crudely made. A bad building has a great negative impact. I remember that Comrade Ri Wuyi, the Fourth Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party, once said: "A bad novel, a bad painting, or a bad song, a bad play, you can more easily take a way to deal with it, for example, you can take the book from the bookshelf of the library, you can take the painting from the wall, you can not arrange these songs or plays into the performance program. However, a bad building, you can only let it exist for decades to embarrass us." This sentence should serve as an alarm bell for architects. The people need practical and beautiful public buildings, and they have a responsibility to make such demands on architects. How to do this well? I am a layman and cannot offer specific opinions. But I think one thing can be done: that is to strengthen criticism and self-criticism in the architectural art circles, so that architectural art gradually improves and always takes a healthy path. I hope that the Architectural Society of China will pay attention to this work, lead architects to carry out criticism and self-criticism, introduce good and beautiful buildings, and criticize bad and ugly buildings. In this way, it can be expected that more architects will establish the architectural design idea of "for the people" and create more excellent masterpieces; those "architects" who regard British and American architectural drawings as "supreme precepts" and cling to them will gradually correct their wrong ideas.

I am a staff member in the army and have not studied architecture, so the opinions I have stated above may not be correct. However, it is the general demand of the broad masses of the people and the due responsibility of architects to make every building on the motherland's land not only practical and economical, but also national in style and beautiful.

### 人民需要经济、实用而优美的建筑物

    人民需要经济、实用而优美的建筑物
    编者按：读者林凡的来信对建筑工作提出了一个值得重视的问题和有益的意见。最近我们还收到了其他读者的几件来信，反映了建筑艺术思想上的一些混乱情况：有一部分建筑师受欧美资产阶级形式主义的思想影响较深，他们不懂得发扬民族传统、甚至鄙视自己民族的东西，他们不懂得什么叫建筑中的社会主义现实主义、什么是社会主义城市发展的原则和社会主义城市的计划性和完整性，他们也不懂得什么是建筑上应有的对人的关怀；他们只凭自己的“爱好”进行设计，因而就出现了像岭南文物宫那样恶劣的建筑。有一部分建筑师不懂得对于民族的建筑遗产应该批判地接受，并在这个基础上创造新的适合当前需要的形式；或者虽然愿意接受民族优秀的建筑艺术传统，但是由于缺乏艰苦钻研的精神，不能掌握特点和规律，于是把中国古代建筑的一切不加选择地都搬出来，在“民族形式”的招牌下贩卖复古主义。另外有相当多的一部分人对建筑中经济、实用和美观三者的一致性缺乏认识，因而错误地认为要美观就要多花钱，不愿意在保证经济和实用的条件下创造更优美的建筑形式；或者单纯注意建筑物外形的艺术处理而忽视了实用和经济上的合理。为了解决上述这些问题，我们中国的先进的建筑学家有责任对资产阶级形式主义的建筑思想开展批判；同时，对如何正确对待民族形式的问题进行讨论，使我们的建筑师们逐步树立社会主义现实主义的艺术思想，使祖国出现更多的经济、实用而且优美的建筑物。编辑同志：
    我非常高兴地看到报纸、杂志上登载的新落成的沈阳体育馆、东北农学院、广州农民讲习所等建筑物的照片。它们都非常美观，有显著的民族风格，叫人看了产生一种美的、安定的和自豪的感情。但是，我也非常惊讶地发现某些地方还在出现着一些很不优美的、甚至是十分丑恶的建筑物。
    现在让我举出广州岭南文物宫作例子吧！这个文物宫包括历史文物馆、水产馆、卫生馆、农林馆、少年儿童宫、剧场、溜冰场等十来个建筑。它是对劳动人民进行爱国主义教育的场所，也是一个供劳动人民休息游乐的地方。没有到过这里的人非常想看看它，但在看到这些建筑以后，人们都会感到这个建筑太糟了。
    本来一群像这样性质的公用建筑物、满可以设计成由中国式的亭、台、榭、阁交错组成的、结构完整的一个整体。而建筑家们却把美国式的、香港式的“方匣子”、“鸽棚”、“流线型”硬往中国搬。这里有上粗下细、引人发生恐怖心理的屋柱；有挑出很远但却像蝉翼一样单薄的阳台；有毫不美观也并不能统一已经非常散乱了的建筑的高塔和圆形建筑物；曲折的墙面不但占地宽、造价贵，并且还不适用，不美观；“落地长窗”（本来采用这种形式必须要有电动开关才行）高得梯子都够不着，开关极不方便；高耸的中门和矮小的侧门并列着，显得极其不调和………。总之，这群建筑物处处都叫人感到突兀、不安定、刺激和奇特。
      当然，在建筑中，正如在其它艺术里面一样，并不反对各种式样的并存，并不反对外来的和民族的各种形式的兼收并蓄；但是，必须要求一群建筑物中采用的各种式样的建筑显得调和，成为一个整体，而其中次要的建筑应该要服从主体。岭南文物宫的建筑显然就不是这样。东一鳞、西一爪，十几个建筑物采用了十几个式样，一点也不调和，一点也没有组织，乱杂一团，不分主次。
    中国人民是不喜欢这样的建筑物的。有一位老太太到岭南文物宫的一个建筑物面前，看到那个倒立型的、上粗下细的屋柱以后，就害怕地说：“我怕！它是不是会垮下来！”兄弟国家的友人们也不欣赏这类建筑物。一位波兰朋友——波兰展览会的设计家看了广州某些建筑物之后说：“这些像小孩玩的积木一样，太难看了！”
   我们知道，目前国家经济建设的方针是集中主要力量发展重工业。但是这决不是说，一般非生产性的建筑就可以粗制滥造了。一个恶劣的建筑物造成的坏影响是很大的。记得匈牙利劳动人民党的第四书记里瓦伊同志曾经说过：“一本不好的小说，一张不好的画，或者一支不好的曲子、一出不好的戏，你都可以比较容易地采取一种办法处理它，比方说你可以把书从图书馆的书架上拿下来，你可以把画从墙上取下来，你可以把这些歌曲或戏不排进上演的节目单中去。然而一个坏的建筑物，你只能让它存在几十年给我们丢脸。”这句话应当做为建筑家们的警钟。人民需要实用的、优美的公用建筑物，他们有责任向建筑师提出这样的要求。要怎样做好这件事呢？我是个外行，不能提出具体意见。但是我觉得有一点是可以办到的：这就是加强建筑艺术界的批评和自我批评，使得建筑艺术逐步提高，永远走健康的道路。希望中国建筑学会重视这个工作，领导建筑家们展开批评与自我批评，介绍好的优美的建筑，批评坏的恶劣的建筑。这样可以预期，将会有更多的建筑家树立起“为人”的建筑设计思想，创造出更多的优秀杰作；那些把英美建筑图样奉为“太上箴言”而死抱住不放的“建筑家”们也会逐渐纠正他们的错误思想。
    我是一个部队里的工作人员，没有研究过建筑，因此，上面所说的意见不见得对。但是，使祖国土地上每一幢建筑物都不但是实用的、经济的，而且是有民族风格的、美丽的，这是广大人民的普遍要求，是建筑家们应尽的责任。
