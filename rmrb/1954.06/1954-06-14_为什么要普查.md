    Why Conduct a General Survey
    Huang Jiqing, Standing Committee Member of the General Survey Committee of the Ministry of Geology

    Editor's Note: This year, China will conduct a large-scale mineral survey. Forty-three survey teams have set off one after another. This is an extremely important task in China's economic construction. Today, this newspaper publishes articles by geological workers, teachers and students from universities participating in mineral survey work, and letters from the people reporting mineral discoveries, explaining the significance of carrying out mineral survey work, introducing the basic knowledge of mineral survey, reflecting the determination of comrades participating in mineral survey work, and the people's concern for the cause of national construction. We hope that all comrades in the survey teams will work hard to complete the tasks assigned by the state, and that Party organizations and government agencies in the survey areas, as well as the people, will vigorously support the mineral survey work.

    Before liberation, a saying was popular among some people: "China is a large country, but its resources are not abundant." The so-called lack of resources specifically referred to mineral resources. So-called experts from imperialist countries often said, "China is poor in resources." In addition, some people saw that China's copper mines were not good at that time, no oil was produced, and steel plants could not be established, so they were discouraged and believed that resource scarcity was true. Geologists at that time could not get the support of the Kuomintang reactionary government, and therefore lacked various modern exploration equipment, which limited geologists' understanding of minerals, often underestimated the economic value of some useful minerals, and conservatively estimated the amount of minerals, which further fueled the slander that "China is poor in resources." For example, geologists at that time discovered a large iron mine in a certain place and estimated that the ore reserves were 34 million tons. This number was already ridiculously low, but the "Seventh China Mining Chronicle" published in 1947 still considered it too much, believing: "This type of deposit is not easy to become rich ore, so it is temporarily estimated at five million metric tons." After liberation, after our detailed exploration, we realized that the actual reserves of this iron mine were dozens or hundreds of times larger than the original estimate.

    Today, more than four years after liberation, it can be said with certainty that China's mineral resources are very rich. This is not a subjective fantasy, but is based on facts and scientific evidence. First of all, in just two or three years, the geological department's mineral exploration work has confirmed many huge mineral deposits. The iron mine mentioned above has been confirmed as a first-class, high-quality iron mine; the Daye Iron Mine has discovered new ore bodies after several years of exploration, and its reserves have increased several times; a copper mine in a certain place, which used to be mined as an iron mine, has now been proven to be an extremely important deposit, comparable to the giant copper mine in the Ural Mountains of the Soviet Union. There are two lead-zinc mines in Central South China, which no one paid attention to in the past, but today they have become China's extremely valuable mineral deposits. These few examples alone can prove that China's mineral resources are rich. Secondly, China is a country with a long history, and mineral resources have been exploited by hardworking laborers very early. According to incomplete statistics in 1950, there were hundreds of iron, copper, manganese, lead, zinc, silver, tungsten and other mineral deposits. After several years of investigation and information from the masses reporting mineral discoveries, the number of producing areas has increased a lot. These producing areas are distributed in various provinces across the country. Most of them are old mines. In the past, scientific work was relatively backward, and the masses only mined when they saw ore. Therefore, it can be inferred that there must be more minerals buried underground. Thirdly, from a theoretical point of view, China's geology can be said to be all-encompassing, with strata of various ages, various types of rocks, and various possible types of geotectonic structures. In other words, the geological conditions for producing various useful minerals are fully available. Someone once said: "China does not have Cenozoic marine strata, so it cannot produce a large amount of oil." However, since the Soviet Union found more oil in the Paleozoic strata of the Second Baku than in Baku, this overturned the fallacy that the Paleozoic cannot produce oil, and our confidence in finding oil in China's Paleozoic and Mesozoic strata has become even stronger.

    China's underground mineral resources are rich, but this does not mean that the mineral resources needed for national construction have been resolved. We must extract the minerals buried underground to meet the needs of national construction. But where to mine, how much equipment is needed, how much manpower is needed, and will it be exhausted after two or three years of mining? What is the grade of the ore, and are there any other minerals mixed in? These problems need to be addressed with a series of mineral exploration work before mining. Only by accurately calculating the ore reserves and grade of this producing area can the state consider whether it is worth mining.

    However, although there are many mineral producing areas in our country, the currently known bases available for exploration are still insufficient. This is because large-scale exploration projects require huge amounts of investment. A medium-sized coalfield exploration team needs hundreds of billions of yuan every year, and a large metal mine, such as a tin mine exploration team, needs several trillion yuan every year. We should never spend so much money on exploration work in any mineral producing area. We can only choose the most valuable and most promising producing areas for exploration. In this way, before large-scale exploration work begins, general survey work must be carried out to initially clarify the value of these mineral producing areas in order to avoid waste.

    In addition to carrying out general survey work in known mineral producing areas, general survey work should also be extended to new areas to find new mineral producing areas. Some people may ask: "There are already so many known mineral producing areas, and the geological forces are so weak that there is not enough time to inspect old mines. Why bother looking for new mines?" This view is incorrect. Although there are indeed many known producing areas, some of them may have no value or little value, others are located in remote areas with inconvenient transportation and cannot be utilized in the short term, and there are some minerals, such as chromium, nickel, vanadium, and phosphorus, which are necessary for modern industry, but little was known about them in the past. If we do not work hard to find new mineral producing areas and new minerals, we will not be able to meet the mineral resources needed for the country's socialist industrialization in a timely manner.

    It should also be pointed out that geological work is a preliminary step in heavy industrial construction and should be ahead of heavy industrial construction. If heavy industry needs iron today, we will look for iron ore; if it needs copper tomorrow, we will look for copper ore. In this way, geological work may not keep up with and meet the needs of the country, and the development of heavy industry will be greatly affected. Moreover, it generally takes three to five years to build a new mine, and it also takes several years to complete the comprehensive exploration of a mineral producing area. This means that the minerals needed for the Second Five-Year Plan should be found now. Therefore, carrying out general survey work is an urgent task for the geological department.

### 为什么要普查

    为什么要普查
    中央地质部普查委员会常务委员　黄汲清
    编者按：今年我国将进行大规模的矿产普查工作，四十三个普查工作队已陆续出发。这是我国经济建设的一项极其重要的工作。今天，本报发表了一些地质工作者、参加矿产普查工作的高等学校的教师和学生的文章，以及人民群众报矿的信件，说明开展矿产普查工作的意义，介绍矿产普查的基本知识，反映了参加矿产普查工作的同志们的决心，以及人民群众对国家建设事业的关怀。我们希望全体普查工作队的同志们，努力完成国家交给的任务，并希望普查地区的党组织和政府机关以及人民群众大力支持矿产普查工作。    
    解放以前，在一部分人中曾流行这样一句话：“中国地大而物不博”，所谓物不博，特别是指着矿产资源说的。帝国主义国家的所谓专家也常说
  “中国资源贫乏”，加上有些人看到当时中国的铜矿没有一个好的，石油还不产一滴，钢铁厂也办不起来，就垂头丧气，认为资源贫乏是千真万确的了。那时的地质工不可能得到国民党反动政府的支持，因而缺乏各种近代的勘探设备，限制了地质工作者对矿产的认识，常常低估了一些有用矿产的经济价值，对矿量的估计也偏于保守，这就更助长了“中国资源贫乏”的谰言。举例来说，那时地质工作者就发现某地有一个大铁矿，估计矿量有三千四百万吨，这个数字已经少得不成话了，然而一九四七年出版的“第七次中国矿业纪要”还嫌它太多，认为：“此类矿床不易成富矿，故暂估为五百万公吨”。解放后，经过我们详细勘探，才知道这个铁矿的真实储量比原来估计的数字要大数十百倍。
    在解放后四年多的今天，已经可以肯定地说，中国的矿产资源是很丰富的。这不是主观的幻想，而是有事实和科学根据的。首先，在短短的两三年中，地质部门的矿产勘探工作已经证实了许多巨大的矿产地。上面所说某地的铁矿，已被证实是头等大的、品质优良的铁矿；大冶铁矿经过几年来的勘探，又发现了新的矿体，储量增加了数倍；某地的铜矿，过去曾当着铁矿开采，现已证明是极重要的矿床，可与苏联乌拉山的巨型铜矿媲美，中南有两处铅锌矿，过去从来没有人重视，今天已成为我国极有价值的矿产地。仅举这几个例子，就可以证明我国矿产资源是丰富的。其次，中国是一个历史悠久的国家，矿产资源很早以前就被辛勤的劳动人民开采着。据一九五零年不完全的统计，铁、铜、锰、铅、锌、银、钨等矿产地都以百计，经过这几年的调查和群众报矿资料，产地又增加了不少。这些产地分布于全国各省，大多数是旧矿，过去科学工作比较落后，群众都是看见矿石才开矿，因此可以推想，埋在地下的矿产一定更多。再其次，从理论方面来说，中国的地质可以说是无所不包，有各种时代的地层，有各式各样的岩石，还有各种可能的大地构造类型。换句话说，产生各种有用矿物的地质条件是完全具备的。曾经有人说：“中国没有新生代的海相地层，所以不能产生大量的石油。”但由于苏联在第二巴库的古生代地层中找到比巴库更多的石油，这就推翻了古生代不能产油的谬论，而我们在中国的古生代和中生代地层中找油的信心更加强了。
    中国的地下矿产资源是丰富的，但这不等于说国家建设需要的矿产资源已经解决了。我们要把埋藏在地下的矿产开采出来，才能满足国家建设的需要。但到哪里去开采，需要多少设备，多少人力，会不会开上两年三年就开完了。矿的品位怎么样，有没有杂着别的矿物，这些问题都需要在开采以前进行一系列的矿产勘探工作，正确地计算这个产地的矿量品位，才能供国家考虑是不是值得开采。
    不过，我国的矿产地虽多，目前已知的可供勘探的基地还是不够的。这是因为大规模的勘探工程需要巨量的投资，一个中等规模的煤田勘探队每年要用几百亿元，一个大的金属矿，例如锡矿勘探队，每年要用几千亿元，我们决不应该在任何矿产地都花这么多钱来进行勘探工作，我们只能选择最有价值，最有把握的产地进行勘探。这样，在大规模勘探工作开始以前，就要先进行普查工作，初步明确这些矿产地的价值，才能避免浪费。
    除了在已知的矿产地要进行普查工作外，还应该把普查工作推广到新的地区去。找寻新的矿产地。也许有人要问：“已知的矿产地已经那么多，地质力量又这么薄弱，检查旧矿还来不及，何必还要找新矿？”这种看法是不正确的。已知的产地诚然很多，但其中有一部分可能没有价值或价值不大，另有一部分位置过于偏僻，交通不便，短期内无法利用，还有一些矿种，如铬、镍、钒、磷等，是现代工业所必需的，但过去知道得很少，如果不努力找新的矿产地，新的矿种，就不能及时满足国家社会主义工业化所需要的矿产资源。
    还需指出：地质工作是重工业建设的先行步骤，应该走在重工业建设的前面。要是重工业今天需要铁，我们才去找铁矿，明天需要铜，我们又去找铜矿。这样，地质工作就可能赶不上和满足不了国家的需要，重工业的发展就会受到很大的影响，况且，新建立一个矿山，一般需要三年到五年，而完成一个矿产地的全面勘探工作，也要几年时间。这就是说，第二个五年计划所需要的矿产，现在就应该设法找到。所以，开展普查工作是地质部门迫不及待的任务。
