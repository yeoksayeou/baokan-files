Xinhua News Agency, June 28th: The Ethnic Affairs Group of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held a report meeting on the 26th, inviting Doga Pengcuo Raojie, head of the Tibetan National Day Observation Delegation, to report on the delegation's tour of various parts of the motherland and their impressions.

More than 200 people attended the report meeting, including representatives from various democratic parties, personnel from the Dalai Lama's Office in Beijing, the Panchen Lama's Office in Beijing, the Buddhist Association of China, the Islamic Association of China, the Central Institute for Nationalities, and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.

Doga Pengcuo Raojie reported on their visit to the interior of the motherland for about six months, observing the economic construction, and introduced the achievements of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, and the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region after the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy. He said: Our motherland is gradually moving towards industrialization. All ethnic minorities have gained equal rights, and freedom of religious belief is guaranteed. Since the peaceful liberation, the Tibetan people have been developing various construction undertakings in the unified family of all ethnic groups in the motherland. These are the great achievements of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao in leading the people of the whole country in peaceful construction. After returning to Tibet this time, we must convey the new situation in the interior of the motherland to all the monks and lay people of Tibet, and work together to build a new Tibet for the motherland.
