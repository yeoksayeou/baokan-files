Reader's Letters - Summary

	A Very Ugly Kind of Printed Cloth
	A letter from a student in the Printing and Dyeing Department of the Applied Arts Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts: Recently, in the windows of flower, yarn, and cloth companies and department stores across the country, a kind of printed cloth with a very ugly pattern has appeared. It is said that this kind of printed cloth is specially designed and printed by the Shanghai Xiongfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory for our children. But strangely, what is printed on this cloth is not beautiful flowers, nor lively and delicate birds and beasts, but several fierce tigers with piercing eyes and bared fangs, and many, many scorpions, centipedes, frogs, poisonous snakes, and other terrible poisonous insects, which make people shudder at first glance.
	With the large-scale economic construction of the motherland and the improvement of the people's material and cultural standards, the broad masses of the people increasingly need newer patterns and more beautiful colors to enrich our happy lives. Thanks to the efforts of pattern designers in various places, new and popular patterns are constantly emerging in the work of printed cloth design, such as mandarin ducks playing in the water, peacocks spreading their wings, and rural life, etc., which are satisfactory and praised by the people.
	However, the appearance of bizarre and unhealthy design patterns on the market cannot but attract our attention. For example, some private factories once produced printed cloths with naked women, crabs, soft-shelled turtles, and snails as content. Some cloths were also printed with many war weapons such as airplanes, cannons, and tanks. Recently, even poisonous insects and fierce beasts have been moved onto printed cloths. The people of the whole country need beautiful children's clothing that is beneficial to the physical and mental health of children. Why should this "five poisons" pattern with strong feudal and superstitious colors be printed? What else can it explain besides reflecting the pattern designers' desire to compete for novelty and their backward thinking?
	The production of a new pattern requires many inspections and studies, and it must be reviewed and determined by the "Pattern Selection Committee" before it can be adopted. The Shanghai Pattern Selection Committee casually allowed this "five poisons" pattern to be produced, promoting feudal superstitious ideas, which is intolerable in the new society. It is hoped that the leading comrades of the East China Textile Administration Bureau will strengthen the education of pattern designers, and conscientiously and responsibly select patterns, so as to prevent such bad patterns from appearing on the market again.

	Don't Use Plastic Wire to Tie Braids
	Reader letters reflect: Recently, many areas have seen women using various colored plastic thin wires as hair ties. Zhao Shaozhe of the Hubei Post and Telecommunications Administration Bureau wrote in a letter: "Recently, many female comrades in Wuhan are using various colored thin wires to tie their braids. This has simply become a trend. Many vendors cater to this mentality, so they buy bundles of wire, cut them short, and sell them on the streets." Ma Xiaoqian, a reader from Luoshan County, Henan, wrote in a letter: "Many female comrades in various agencies in our county use red silk wire to tie their hair. At first, this phenomenon was individual, but it gradually became common, and now even many female students in schools are imitating it." The New Guizhou Daily's reader letter group once forwarded a batch of reader letters, reflecting that similar phenomena also exist in some cities in Guizhou Province. The readers in these letters unanimously pointed out that wire and cable equipment is one of the national construction materials, and this construction material should be put into the places where the country needs it, and should not be wasted on braids.
	According to our understanding, we cannot currently produce this kind of plastic wire domestically, and it needs to be imported from abroad. Using this telecommunications equipment that is useful for national construction as a hair tie is undoubtedly a waste. Therefore, it is hoped that women in various places will no longer use this wire as a hair tie, but use other ropes, threads, and cloth strips. State-owned commercial departments in various places should exercise appropriate control when selling this wire to ensure that it is not wasted. Local industrial and commercial administrative departments should also educate private merchants to no longer sell this wire as hair ties.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    一种十分丑恶的花布
    中央美术学院实用美术学系印染科学生来信：最近，在各地花纱布公司、百货公司的橱窗里，出现了一种花样十分丑恶的花布，据说这种花布是上海雄峰印染厂专门为我们儿童设计印制的。但奇怪的是这种花布上印制的不是美丽的鲜花，也不是活泼玲珑的鸟兽，而是几只目光如炬张牙舞爪的猛虎和很多很多蝎子、蜈蚣、蛙、毒蛇等等可怕的毒虫，使人一看就不寒而栗。
    随着祖国大规模的经济建设，人民物质文化水平的提高，广大人民是愈来愈需要更新的花样、更美丽的色彩来丰富我们幸福的生活，由于各地的图案设计工作者的努力，花布设计工作中不断地涌现出新的人民喜闻乐见的花样，如鸳鸯戏水、孔雀开屏、农家乐等等，这是为人民所满意而赞扬的。
    但是，离奇古怪的不健康的设计花样在市场上出现，不能不引起我们的注意，如某些私营工厂曾出品以裸体女人、蟹、甲鱼、田螺等等为内容的花布，有的布上还印上了很多飞机、大炮、坦克之类的战争武器。最近，甚至连毒虫猛兽也搬到花布上去了。全国人民需要有益于儿童身心健康的美观的儿童衣料，为什么要把这种带有浓厚封建毒素迷信色彩的“五毒”花样印制出来呢？除了反映图案设计工作者争奇斗异、思想落后，还能说明什么呢？
    一种新花样的生产，是要经过很多次检查、研究，并经过“花样评选会”的审核确定后采用的，上海的花样评选会随随便便地让这种“五毒”花样生产出来，助长封建的迷信思想，这是新社会中不能容忍的。希望华东纺织管理局的领导同志加强对图案设计人员的教育，并切实认真负责地评选花样，免得那种恶劣的花样再出现于市场。
    不要用塑型胶电线扎辫子
    读者来信反映：近来不少地区都出现了妇女用各色胶皮细电线作扎发绳的情况。湖北邮电管理局赵邵哲来信说：“近来武汉市有很多妇女同志用各色细电线扎辫子，这简直成了一种风气。很多商贩迎合这种心理，就买了成把的电线剪短了在街头卖。”河南罗山县读者马笑千来信说：“我县各机关不少女同志都用红丝电线扎头发。开始时这种现象是个别的，后来逐渐普遍起来，现在连学校里的不少女学生也仿行了。”新黔日报读者来信组曾转来一批读者来信，反映贵州省某些城市也有类似现象。这些来信的读者一致指出，电线器材是属于国家建设器材之一，应该使这种建设器材投入国家需要的地方去，不要浪费在辫子上。
    据我们了解，目前我们国内还不能生产这种塑型胶电线，需要从国外进口。把这种国家建设中有用的电讯器材当扎发绳，无疑是一种浪费。因此，希望各地妇女不要再把这种电线当扎发绳，而改用其它绳线布带。各地国营商业部门在出售这种电线时应作适当控制，以保证不被浪费。各地工商行政管理部门也应该教育私商不再把这种电线当扎发绳出卖。
