    The Eleventh All-Union Congress of Trade Unions
    Resolution on the Summary Report of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions
    The Eleventh All-Union Congress of Trade Unions passed a resolution on the summary report of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions on the 15th. The congress approved the work of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions in the five years since the closing of the Tenth All-Union Congress of Trade Unions.
    The resolution emphasized that during this period, under the leadership of the Communist Party, Soviet trade unions have done tremendous work in mobilizing the broad masses of workers and staff to strive to fulfill and overfulfill the national economic plan and to realize the tasks put forward by the Communist Party and the Soviet government to the whole country. The congress also pointed out that there are serious shortcomings in the work of various trade unions, and the level of the trade unions' mass organization, production, cultural life, and educational work does not meet the requirements put forward by the trade unions at the current stage of communist construction.
    The resolution of the congress stated that the role of trade unions as schools of communist education and as combat organizers of the masses is increasingly enhanced under the current circumstances. The Communist Party and the Soviet government are concentrating all the people's strength to complete the great task: to rapidly increase the production of agriculture and consumer goods on the basis of the powerful development of socialist industry in the next two or three years, to ensure further improvement of the living standards of the working people, and to meet their growing material and cultural needs. As the most massive organization of the Soviet working people, the Soviet trade unions should concentrate all their strength and energy to successfully complete this historical task.
    The congress instructed all trade unions to give play to the creative initiative and energy of workers, engineers, and technicians, to maximize the use of internal potentials of the national economy, and to reduce production costs and improve product quality in every enterprise, construction project, transportation industry, machine tractor station, and state farm.
    Special attention should be paid to continuously increasing labor productivity in various sectors of the national economy, because only by increasing labor productivity can all economic indicators of enterprises be improved, and because the increase in labor productivity is the foundation for the technological progress of the country and the continuous improvement of the living standards of the working people.
    The resolution pointed out that all trade unions must unremittingly strive to improve labor organization and production organization, further mechanize the production process, correctly and effectively use machines and equipment, widely promote the experience of advanced workers, vigorously support production innovators, inventors, and rationalization proposers, and strengthen attention to the production education of workers and improve their skills.
    The most important task of the trade union is to launch a nationwide socialist competition. All trade unions should try to expand the ranks of advanced workers, help the laggards catch up with the level of the advanced, and strive for continuous and comprehensive improvement on this basis. In the vigorous and creative cause of socialist competition, we must resolutely eliminate formalism and bureaucracy.
    The task of rapidly increasing national agriculture put forward by the Party and the government is the trade union's own business. The congress instructed the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and various trade union organizations to widely mobilize the staff of machine tractor stations and state farms to launch competition for increasing the yield per unit area of various crops, for further developing public animal husbandry, and for maximizing the production efficiency of tractors, combines, and other agricultural machinery.
    Production meetings are an important form of attracting the broad masses of workers, engineers, technicians, and staff to actively participate in the management of production and the improvement of labor organization. Trade union organizations should enhance the role of production meetings in striving to complete state plans and achieve the best savings results for each enterprise.
    Trade union organizations should strive to participate in the work of formulating plans for adjusting workers' wages, implement wage systems that can stimulate the increase of labor productivity in enterprises, machine tractor stations, and state farms, take measures to promote and improve technical quotas in production, strengthen the inspection of labor statistics, and adopt piece-rate and progressive wage systems.
    Collective contracts have great organizational power in striving to complete state plans, realizing further measures to rationalize labor conditions, and increasing the material and cultural welfare of workers and staff. Trade union organizations should enhance the role of collective contracts, should enhance the mutual responsibility of economic leaders and trade union leaders, so as to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the contract in a timely and unconditional manner, and should widely absorb trade union activists to supervise the implementation of collective contracts.
    It is the sacred responsibility of trade unions to constantly care about improving the material welfare and cultural level of the Soviet people. The congress instructed trade union organizations at all levels to unremittingly and vigorously oppose the attitude of indifference and disregard for the needs of the working people, to strive to improve the labor conditions and living conditions of workers and staff, and to strive to vigorously strengthen and improve the work of state organs, economic organs, and trade union organizations, and to thoroughly eradicate bureaucracy and procrastination in all links of these organs.
    Trade union organizations at all levels should take timely measures to unconditionally complete the construction plans of housing, cultural welfare organs, trade, and public utility enterprises. The congress instructed the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the central committees of various trade unions, and trade union organizations at all levels to improve social insurance work, strive to improve the level of medical services for the working people, and more widely absorb workers and staff to supervise whether social insurance premiums are used correctly, and supervise the work of hospitals, polyclinics, children's welfare organs, sanatoriums, and rest homes. The congress instructed the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions to take measures to further expand the sanatorium network, especially in the Ural, Siberia, Far East, and Central Asia regions.
    All trade unions should regularly help workers and staff to educate their children, strengthen ties with schools and Communist Youth League organizations, strengthen the education of children in clubs, libraries, and sports grounds, increase Young Pioneer camps, and improve their work.
    One of the most important tasks of trade union organizations at all levels in improving the living conditions of trade union members is to do their best to help further reduce the labor of female workers. To this end, special attention should be paid to the labor protection of women, increasing kindergartens, nurseries, canteens, public laundries, sewing repair shops, and all living welfare organs, and strengthening supervision over them, so that female workers can be more widely absorbed to actively participate in production and social activities.
    The congress believes that trade unions have the responsibility to actively participate in the completion of the historically significant task—making all workers and peasants cultured and educated people, regularly caring about improving the political and comprehensive education level of trade union members, absorbing workers and staff to participate in technical and comprehensive education schools and groups, participating in specialized night schools and correspondence schools, participating in night universities and correspondence universities, and widely introducing them to science and the work achievements of advanced producers.
    The cultural and educational organs of the trade union should be good at combining mass political work with organizing the rest of the workers and staff, and in their activities should take into account the needs of all types of workers, such as cadre workers, youth, and women, make better use of movies, more widely develop amateur artistic activities; and improve their level.
    The congress pointed out that it is necessary to expand and consolidate the ties between trade union organizations and the masses, and use various methods to give play to the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the workers. The congress requires trade union organizations at all levels to strictly abide by the principles of trade union democracy and collective leadership, regularly make summary reports and elect trade union organs, enhance the role of general workers' congresses, and improve the work of activists in a planned way. It is necessary to widely unfold criticism and self-criticism.
    During the period involved by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the Soviet trade unions strengthened the activities of enhancing the fighting unity of the world's workers and trade union movement, strengthening the defense and consolidation of world peace, and expanded and strengthened the friendly ties between the Soviet trade unions and foreign trade unions. The role of the Soviet trade unions in the World Federation of Trade Unions and its various industrial departments has been strengthened.
    The congress instructed the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and the central committees of various trade unions to continue to actively participate in the work of the World Federation of Trade Unions in the future. Strengthen the fraternal friendship and ties with the trade unions of the People's Republic of China and the People's Democratic countries, and expand the ties between the Soviet trade unions and Soviet workers and the trade union organizations of capitalist and colonial countries.
    The resolution concluded by saying that the Soviet trade unions, loyal to the great banner of proletarian internationalism, regard it as their sacred duty to unremittingly strengthen the unity and solidarity of the working class of all countries, and jointly struggle for peace, for democracy, for improving the living standards of the working people, and for the bright future of all mankind.

    第十一届全苏工会代表大会
    就全苏工会中央理事会总结报告通过决议
    第十一届全苏工会代表大会十五日根据全苏工会中央理事会的总结报告通过了一项决议。代表大会赞同全苏工会中央理事会在第十届全苏工会代表大会闭幕以来的五年当中的工作。
    决议强调指出，在这一段时期中，苏联工会在共产党的领导下，在动员广大职工群众争取完成和超额完成国民经济计划和实现共产党和苏联政府向全国提出的任务中，曾做了巨大的工作。代表大会同时也指出，各工会工作中存在有严重的缺点，工会的组织群众、生产、文化生活及教育工作的水平，不符合共产主义建设现阶段对工会所提出的要求。
    代表大会的决议中说道，工会作为共产主义教育的学校，作为群众的战斗组织者的作用，在目前的情况下越来越提高了。共产党和苏联政府正集中人民所有的力量去完成伟大的任务：在最近两三年内，在社会主义工业强大发展的基础上，使农业和消费品的生产急剧提高，保证劳动人民的生活获得进一步的改善，满足他们不断增长的物质和文化的要求。作为苏联劳动人民的最富有群众的组织的苏联工会，应当集中一切力量和精力来胜利地完成这个历史任务。
    代表大会责成各工会发挥工人和工程技术人员的创造主动性和精力，来最大限度地利用国民经济内部的潜力，使每一个企业、建筑工程、运输业、每一个机器拖拉机站和每一个国营农场都降低生产成本并提高产品质量。
    应特别注意不断提高国民经济各部门的劳动生产率，因为，只有提高劳动生产率，才能提高各企业的一切经济指标，因为劳动生产率的提高是国家技术进步和劳动人民生活水平不断提高的基础。
    决议指出，各工会必须坚持不懈地争取改善劳动组织和生产组织，使生产过程进一步机械化，正确地和有效地使用机器和装备，必须广泛地推广先进工作者的经验，大力支持生产革新者，发明家和合理化建议者，加强注意工人们的生产教育，提高他们的熟练程度。
    工会最重要的任务是展开全民社会主义竞赛。各工会应当设法扩大先进工作者的队伍，帮助落后者跟上先进者的水平，并在这个基础上争取不断的全面的提高。在社会主义竞赛这个生气勃勃和创造性的事业中，要坚决铲除形式主义和官僚主义。
    党和政府提出的急速提高国家农业的任务，是工会的切身的事业。代表大会责成全苏工会中央理事会和各工会组织广泛地发动机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员，为提高各种农作物的单位面积产量，为进一步发展公有畜牧业，为使拖拉机、联合机和其他农业机器发挥高度的生产效能而展开竞赛。
    生产会议是吸引广大的工人群众、工程技术人员和职员积极参加管理生产和改进劳动组织的工作的重要形式。工会组织应该提高生产会议在争取完成国家计划和使每个企业都取得最优良的节约成绩这些方面的作用。
    工会组织应该努力参加拟定调整职工工资计划的工作，在各企业、机器拖拉机站和国营农场中要实行能刺激劳动生产率的提高的工资制度，采取一些办法在生产中推行和改进技术定额，加紧检查劳动统计，采用按件计酬和累进追加的工资制度。
    集体合同在为争取完成国家计划、实现进一步使劳动条件合理化的措施、增进职工的物质和文化福利方面有很大的组织力量。工会组织应该提高集体合同的作用，应该提高经济领导干部和工会领导干部的相互的责任心，以便及时地和无条件地实现合同所规定的义务，应该广泛地吸收工会积极分子来监督执行集体合同。
    经常关心提高苏联人民的物质福利状况和文化水平，这是工会的神圣的责任。代表大会责成各级工会组织：坚持不懈地大力反对那种对劳动人民的需要漠不关心和毫不重视的态度，力求改善职工的劳动条件和生活条件，争取大力加强和改进国家机关、经济机关及工会组织的工作，彻底根除这些机关的一切环节中的官僚主义和疲沓作风。
    各级工会组织应当及时采取措施，来无条件地完成住宅、文化福利机关、贸易和公用企业的建筑计划。代表大会责成全苏工会中央理事会、各工会中央委员会及各级工会组织改进社会保险工作，争取提高对劳动人民的医疗服务的水平，更广泛地吸收职工来监督社会保险费是否正确地使用，监督医院、联合诊疗所、儿童福利机关、疗养院和休养所的工作。代表大会责成全苏工会中央理事会采取措施，以进一步扩大疗养地网，特别是乌拉尔、西伯利亚、远东和中亚细亚等地的疗养地网。
    各工会应经常帮助职工教养子女，加强与学校和共青团组织的联系，加强俱乐部、图书馆、运动场中对儿童的教养工作，增加少年先锋营，并改进它们的工作。
    各级工会组织在改善工会会员生活条件方面的最重要的任务之一，就是尽力帮助进一步减轻女工的劳动。为此，应特别注意妇女的劳动保护，增设幼儿园、托儿所、食堂、公共洗衣房、缝纫修补店及一切生活福利机关，并加强对它们的监督，这样就可以更广泛地吸收女工积极参加生产和社会活动。
    代表大会认为，工会有责积极参加完成具有历史意义的任务——使所有的工人和农民成为有文化和有教养的人，经常关心提高工会会员的政治水平和综合教育水平，吸收职工参加技术和综合教育学校与小组，参加专科夜校和函授学校，参加夜大学和函授大学，向他们广泛地介绍科学和先进生产者的工作成就。
    工会的文化教育机关应当善于把群众政治工作和组织职工的休息结合起来，在其活动中应当考虑到干部工人、青年和妇女等各类劳动者的需要，更好地利用电影，更广泛地发展业余艺术活动；并提高其水平。
    代表大会指出，必须扩大和巩固工会组织和群众的联系，用各种办法发挥劳动者的积极性、主动性和创造性。代表大会要求各级工会组织严格遵守工会民主和集体领导的原则，定期地作总结报告和选举工会机关，提高全体职工大会的作用，有计划地改善对积极分子的工作。必须广泛地展开批评和自我批评。
    苏联工会在全苏工会中央理事会所涉及的时期内，加强了增强世界工人和工会运动的战斗团结，加强了保卫和巩固世界和平的活动，扩大并加强了苏联工会和外国工会的友谊联系。苏联工会在世界工会联合会及其各产业部里所起的作用加强了。
    代表大会责成全苏工会中央理事会和各工会中央委员会今后继续积极参加世界工联的工作。加强和中华人民共和国及人民民主国家的工会的兄弟友谊联系，扩大苏联工会和苏联工人跟资本主义和殖民地国家的工会组织的联系。
    决议最后说，忠于无产阶级国际主义伟大旗帜的苏联工会认为自己的神圣职责是：坚持不懈地加强各国工人阶级的统一和团结，共同为争取和平、争取民主，争取提高劳动人民的生活水平，为全人类的美好前途而斗争。
