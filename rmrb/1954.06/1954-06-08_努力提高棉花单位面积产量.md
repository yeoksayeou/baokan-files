Strive to Increase Cotton Yield Per Unit Area
Zang Chengyao Yang Shufan

The national cotton planting task has been completed. This is a major victory in mobilizing farmers to produce according to the national plan. However, it should be recognized that completing the planned cotton planting acreage does not equate to completing the cotton production increase plan. From now until the cotton harvest is complete, we must vigorously strengthen cotton field cultivation management and overcome natural disasters. This is a long-term struggle task for cadres at all levels and cotton farmers in the cotton-growing areas.

Increasing cotton production should focus on increasing yield per unit area. According to the state's 1954 agricultural production plan, in addition to appropriately expanding cotton field acreage in suitable cotton-growing areas, cotton yield per unit area is required to increase by 10 percent based on 1953. That is to say, the national average yield per mu should increase by three *shi jin* of lint cotton compared to last year. We have many favorable conditions to complete this task: In recent years, thanks to the leadership of the Party and the People's Government in organizing cotton farmers to improve farming techniques, the production base in cotton-growing areas has gradually consolidated, and the level of cultivation has continuously improved. This spring, agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams have seen greater development, laying a better foundation for expanding investment, allocating labor, and adopting new technologies. With the development of China's industry, pesticides and machinery for pest control can be produced in large quantities, which can adequately meet the current needs of cotton farmers for pest control. In recent years, the economic development of cotton-growing areas has been rapid, the strength for expanded reproduction has generally increased, and the masses and cadres have also gained a lot of experience in improving cotton planting techniques.

However, it is also necessary to recognize the difficulties: This year, in some areas, the cotton planting task was issued relatively late, and the mobilization work was carried out later and worse, and the masses were insufficiently prepared ideologically and materially; in the northern cotton areas, there were many winds and little rain during the sowing season, and seizing moisture for sowing emphasized quantity but ignored quality, resulting in uneven emergence of seedlings and a very common phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken rows; various cotton pests have been seriously harmful for years, and at present, the preparation of pesticides and machinery in many areas is still very insufficient. These will affect this year's cotton production increase. Currently, cadres in some areas underestimate the arduousness of the final completion of the cotton production increase task; after completing the cotton sowing task, a mood of relaxation has emerged. This mood is very detrimental to the work.

In the current situation of rain shortage and drought this year, rough sowing, and widespread and serious lack of seedlings and broken rows, the most prominent issue is to do a good job in cotton seedling inspection, seedling replacement, and thinning to ensure full stands. In the past, many areas did not give due attention to this work and lacked in-depth inspection and meticulous organization and mobilization work. It should be known that the conservative thinking of "replacing seedlings only when seven out of ten are missing, and refusing to replace seedlings when eight out of ten are missing" among the masses has not yet been overcome, and the phenomenon of missing seedlings has been generally serious over the years. This year, more than 83 million mu of cotton have been planted nationwide; if calculated at a 10% seedling shortage, it would be equivalent to planting more than 8.3 million mu of cotton fields less. According to this year's planned yield per unit area, more than 270 million *jin* of lint cotton will be lost. What a serious loss this is to the country and the people! Therefore, we should widely and deeply carry out seedling inspection and replacement work, give play to the strength of being organized, fully utilize female labor and semi-labor, and implement "early thinning, even seedling retention, and timely seedling determination," and promptly transplant or replant when missing seedlings are found to ensure full stands. Correct thinning and seedling protection work is also a prerequisite for appropriately increasing cotton plant density. Although the promotion of cotton close planting technology has achieved certain results in recent years, the number of plants in general cotton fields has still not reached the due density. In the northern cotton areas, there are still very common areas with less than 3,000 plants per mu, and in the southern cotton areas, there are still very common areas with less than 2,000 plants per mu of upland cotton; individual areas have still not changed the sparse planting habit of planting "lying cow flowers" (rows can lie down a cow), with only about 1,000 plants per mu. In these areas, it is necessary to do a good job of demonstration work on close planting and yield increase according to local conditions, and guide the masses to appropriately increase the number of plants when thinning and determining seedlings.

Preventing and controlling cotton pests is also an important measure to ensure yield and improve quality. Cotton aphids, spider mites, mirid bugs, cotton bollworms, bollworms, leaf rollers, etc., are quite common and serious in the main cotton-growing areas of China. In 1952, the area of cotton fields affected by various pests nationwide reached more than 42 million mu; in 1953, the area affected by cotton aphids reached more than 12 million mu in Henan, Shanxi, and the Handan area of Hebei alone. These pests have greatly affected the yield and quality of cotton. Due to the small amount of snow last year, seedling stage pests may be serious again this year. We must be vigilant, reserve enough pesticides and machinery for pest control so that we can promptly lead the masses to carry out unremitting struggles against various pests. Now the state can produce a large number of pesticides and sprayers such as "666" and "DDT", and the prices have also been reduced, providing favorable conditions for preventing and controlling cotton pests; we should widely mobilize the masses to fully apply pesticides and machinery for pest control, and strive not to reduce cotton production due to pests. We should strengthen technical guidance on pesticide and machinery pest control, emphasize prevention and early treatment, and promote comprehensive prevention and treatment and combined treatment methods. In 1953, the Jinghuiqu cotton area in Shaanxi Province used "666" to control mirid bugs on 160,000 mu, and the cotton buds and bolls of the generally controlled cotton were twice as many as those of the uncontrolled cotton.

Due to the insufficient supply of commercial fertilizers before cotton sowing this year, and the insufficient preparation of production materials by the masses in areas where the mobilization of cotton field expansion was late, the application of base fertilizer in many cotton fields was too small or no base fertilizer was applied at all. For example, in Linfen area, Shanxi Province, about 8% of cotton fields had no base fertilizer applied. Therefore, we must pay attention to increasing topdressing fertilizer to remedy the lack of fertilizer in cotton fields. All localities should make full use of existing oil raw materials and processing equipment to accelerate the processing of oilcake fertilizer and conduct necessary adjustments and reasonable distribution to cotton-growing areas according to different conditions and needs. We must vigorously implement the principle of relying mainly on self-accumulated fertilizers by farmers and supplementing them with commercial fertilizers, actively lead the masses to increase fertilizer accumulation, so that cotton fields can be topdressed in a timely manner. We must also guide the masses to apply fertilizers reasonably by ditch application, hole application, and other methods to maximize the effectiveness of fertilizers.

Stiff petal yellow flowers in upland cotton in southern cotton areas often account for 15% to 30% of the yield, and frost yellow flowers in northern cotton areas generally reach 10% to 20%. These are serious losses in cotton yield and quality. Therefore, in addition to doing a good job of thinning seedlings, protecting seedlings, preventing and controlling diseases and pests, applying topdressing fertilizer, as well as a series of cotton field management tasks such as cultivating and weeding, irrigating to prevent drought, and draining to prevent waterlogging, to create good conditions for cotton growth and development, we must also earnestly promote pruning techniques to prevent cotton plants from growing excessively, reduce bud and boll drop, and promote early maturity to increase yield and improve quality. Scientific research and mass practice have proven that cotton pruning is a valuable agricultural technical measure. Its main function is to reduce unnecessary consumption of cotton plants. The results of experiments at Nantong Agricultural College in Jiangsu Province: 30% of unpruned cotton has stiff petal yellow flowers; pruned cotton has only 19% stiff petal yellow flowers. A typical survey in Li County, Hebei Province, showed that the average number of cotton bolls with frost-front flowers per plant was 5.6 for those that had their terminal buds removed between Lesser Heat and Greater Heat and their cluster tips removed before the Beginning of Autumn; the average number of cotton bolls with frost-front flowers per plant was 4.5 for those that had their terminal buds removed before the Beginning of Autumn and their cluster tips removed after the End of Heat. A difference of more than one boll per cotton plant means a difference of more than 3,000 cotton bolls for 3,000 plants per mu. Calculating one jin of seed cotton for every hundred cotton bolls, cotton with timely terminal bud removal and early cluster tip removal yields more than 30 jin of frost-front flowers per mu than cotton with late terminal bud removal and late cluster tip removal. Although pruning has been generally carried out in northern cotton areas, the removal of lower branches and terminal bud removal are late, and the removal of cluster tips and excess buds has not been generally accepted by the masses; pruning techniques in southern cotton areas are only being tested in farms and among a small number of farmers and have not been widely promoted. All localities should carry out publicity and education on cotton pruning in light of existing problems. Technical cadres should enrich their pruning experience from practice, provide on-site guidance to the masses, and steadily promote the correct pruning methods of "removing lower branches when the first fruiting branch shows buds, removing terminal buds after leaving a certain number of fruiting branches, removing cluster tips in a timely manner, and removing excess buds at any time."

Strengthening cotton field cultivation management and pest control is a long-term task, and agricultural leading organs in various localities should grasp the production season closely according to local characteristics and carry out prospective guidance and supervision and inspection. Relaxing leadership in any production season will affect the completion of the planned production; failure to complete the production increase task in a certain area will also affect the state's overall production plan. Concentrated upland cotton areas account for a large proportion of both area and yield, and should be given priority in terms of material supply and cadre allocation, and the requirements for technical promotion should also be higher; at the same time, the masses in these areas have rich cotton planting experience and should also be used as a base for exchanging technical experience and promoting comprehensive production increase. The masses in new cotton areas have poor cotton planting techniques, and special attention should be paid to doing a good job of technical guidance and improving the enthusiasm of the masses for cotton planting, which is not only important for ensuring this year's production but also greatly related to appropriately expanding cotton fields in the future. When carrying out technical promotion work, we must change the way of making only general appeals, and we must oppose the sloppy style of "a few days difference, a few plants difference, a little difference doesn't matter." If you don't know how to do it, study with old farmers and get started yourself to enrich your technical experience from labor practice. More importantly, we should focus on farms and agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and through their demonstration role, drive the vast number of individual farmers to improve cotton planting techniques, so as to achieve comprehensive production increase and complete and overfulfill the state plan.

    努力提高棉花单位面积产量
    臧成耀　杨树藩
    全国棉花播种任务已经完成了。这是动员农民按照国家计划进行生产的一个重大的胜利。但是，应该认识，完成了棉花播种亩数的计划，并不等于完成了棉花增产计划。从目前开始到棉花收获完了，还必须大力加强棉田栽培管理，战胜自然灾害。这是棉区各级干部和棉农的长期的斗争任务。
    增加棉花产量应以提高单位面积产量为主。按照一九五四年国家的农业生产计划，除在适宜植棉地区适当扩大一定的棉田面积外，要求棉花单位面积产量在一九五三年的基础上提高百分之十，就是说，全国平均每亩产量要比去年增加皮棉三市斤。要完成这个任务我们是有许多有利条件的：几年来，由于党和人民政府领导棉农组织起来改进耕作技术，棉区生产基础逐渐巩固，耕作水平不断提高。今年春天，农业生产合作社、互助组有了更大的发展，给扩大投资、调配劳力和接受新的技术等打下了更好的基础。随着我国工业的发展，治虫药械已能大量生产，可以适当地满足目前棉农治虫的需要。几年来棉区经济发展较快，扩大再生产的力量普遍提高，群众和干部在改进植棉技术上，也有了许多经验。
    可是，也要认识到困难的一面：今年有些地区，植棉任务下达较迟，动员工作进行得较晚较差，群众在思想上、物质上准备不足；北方棉区在播种季节风多雨少，抢墒播种，只重视了数量，而忽略了质量，因而出苗不齐，缺苗断垅现象极为普遍；各种棉花害虫历年为害严重，目前许多地区药械的准备还很不足。这些都会影响今年棉花产量的提高。目前，有些地区的干部低估了最后完成棉花增产任务的艰巨性；在完成棉花播种任务以后，产生了松懈情绪。这种情绪对于工作是非常不利的。
    在今年缺雨干旱，播种粗糙，缺苗断垅普遍严重的情况下，当前最突出的问题，是要做好棉花的查苗、补苗、间苗工作，保证全苗。过去很多地区对这个工作没有给予应有的重视，缺乏深入的检查和细致的组织动员工作。要知道，群众当中“七缺八不缺”（缺苗十分之七才补，缺十分之八就不肯补苗了）的保守思想仍未克服，历年缺苗现象普遍严重。全国今年种棉八千三百余万亩；如以缺苗一成计算，就等于少种了八百三十多万亩棉田；按照今年计划的单位面积产量，要损失二亿七千多万斤皮棉。这对国家和人民是多么严重的损失！因此，应当广泛而深入地开展查苗补苗工作，发挥组织起来的力量，充分运用妇女劳力和半劳力，实行“早间苗、匀留苗、适时定苗”，发现缺苗及时移栽或补种，保证全苗。正确的间苗、保苗工作，也是适当增加棉株密度的前提条件。几年来棉花密植技术的推广虽然有一定成绩，但一般棉田株数仍未达到应有的密度。北方棉区每亩在三千株以下的，南方棉区细绒棉每亩在二千株以下的，仍很普遍；个别地区仍未改变种“卧牛花”（行间可以卧得下牛）的稀植习惯，每亩仅有一千株左右。在这些地区，必须根据当地条件，做好密植增产示范工作，指导群众在间苗定苗时适当地增加株数。
    防治棉虫也是保证产量、提高质量的重要措施。棉蚜、红蜘蛛、盲椿象、红铃虫、棉铃虫、卷叶虫等，在我国主要棉区为害相当普遍而严重。一九五二年全国各种虫害为害棉田面积，达四千二百多万亩；一九五三年棉蚜为害面积，仅河南，山西及河北邯郸专区，即达一千二百多万亩。这些虫害，大大影响了棉花的产量和质量。由于去年雪少，今年苗期虫害又可能严重。必须提高警惕，储备足够的治虫药械，以便及时领导群众向各种虫害进行不懈的斗争。现在国家已能大量生产“六六六”、
  “滴滴涕”、喷雾器等治虫用品，价格也已经降低，对防治棉虫提供了有利条件；应广泛地发动群众充分应用药械治虫，力争不因虫害而使棉花减产。应加强对药械治虫的技术指导，重视预防和早治，提倡综合性的防治及兼治的方法。一九五三年陕西省泾惠渠棉区用“六六六”在十六万亩地上防治盲椿象，一般防治过的棉花的蕾铃比没有防治的棉花蕾铃多一倍。
    由于今年棉花播种前商品肥料的供应量不足，加以扩大棉田工作动员较晚地区群众生产资料准备也不够充分，许多棉田基肥的施用量过少或根本没施基肥。如山西省临汾专区，就有百分之八左右的棉田没有施基肥。因此，必须注意增施追肥，补救棉田缺肥现象。各地应尽量利用现有油料原料和加工设备，加速饼肥加工；并按照不同条件和需要，对棉区进行必要的调剂和合理的分配。要大力贯彻以农家自积肥料为主、商品肥料为辅的方针，积极领导群众增积肥料，使棉田能够及时进行追肥。还要指导群众用沟施、穴施等办法合理地施用肥料，以发挥肥料的最大效能。
    南方棉区细绒棉僵瓣黄花，常占产量的百分之十五至三十，北方棉区霜黄花一般达百分之十至二十。在棉花的产量上和品质上，都是严重的损失。因此，除须做好间苗、保苗、防治病虫、施追肥，以及中耕除草、灌溉防旱、排水防涝等一系列的棉田管理工作，给棉花生长发育创造良好条件外，还要切实推行整枝技术，防止棉株徒长，减少落蕾、落铃，促进早熟，才能够增加产量，提高品质。科学研究及群众实践已经证明，棉花整枝是有价值的农业技术措施之一。其主要作用，是使棉株减少不必要的消耗。江苏省南通农学院试验的结果：不整枝的棉花，有百分之三十的僵瓣黄花；整枝的棉花，僵瓣黄花只有百分之十九。河北省蠡县的典型调查，小暑到大暑之间摘心，立秋前摘完群尖的，平均每棵霜前开絮的棉桃，有五点六个；立秋前摘心，处暑后才摘群尖的，平均每棵霜前开絮的棉桃有四点五个。一棵棉花差一个多桃，一亩地三千棵就差三千多个棉桃。以一百个棉桃摘一斤籽棉计算，适时摘心，早打群尖的棉花比晚摘心、晚打群尖的棉花，一亩地多收三十多斤霜前花。目前北方棉区虽已普遍进行整枝，但脱裤腿、摘心较晚，摘群尖、去赘芽尚未被群众普遍接受；南方棉区整枝技术，仅在农场和少数农民中间试行，还没有广泛推广。各地应针对存在的问题，做好关于棉花整枝的宣传教育。技术干部应当从实践中，充实整枝经验，实地指导群众，稳步推行“在第一个果枝现蕾时即行脱裤腿，留够一定数目的果枝即摘心，及时摘群尖，随时去赘芽”的正确整枝方法。
    加强棉田栽培管理和防治虫害，是一项长期性的工作，各地农业领导机关要按照当地的特点，紧紧掌握生产季节，进行预见性的指导和督促检查。放松某一个生产季节的领导，就会影响计划产量的完成；某一个地区不能完成增产任务，也会影响国家整个的生产计划。集中的细绒棉区，面积和产量都占很大比重，在物质供应和干部配备方面都应做为重点，技术推广的要求也要高些；同时，这些地区的群众植棉经验丰富，也应做为交流技术经验推动全面增产的基地。新棉区群众植棉技术较差，应特别注意做好技术指导，提高群众植棉积极性，这不仅对保证今年产量有重要作用，对于今后适当扩大棉田也有很大关系。进行技术推广工作时，要改变只作一般化的号召的方式，要反对“差几天、差几棵、差一点都没关系”的粗枝大叶作风，不会的就和老农研究，亲自下手，从劳动实践中充实技术经验。更重要的是以农场和农业生产合作社、互助组为重点，通过他们的示范作用，带动广大个体农民改进植棉技术，以求全面增产，完成和超额完成国家计划。
