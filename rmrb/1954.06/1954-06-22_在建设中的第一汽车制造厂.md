    The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant Under Construction
    Meng Shaonong, Deputy Director and Chief Engineer of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant
    I. An Unusual Event
    The construction of China's first automobile manufacturing plant is proceeding day and night. This will be a factory equipped with world-class technology. From the end of its assembly line, excellent domestically produced automobiles will flow out like water, spreading across the vast land, rushing to serve industrial and agricultural production, national defense construction, and the needs of the broad masses of the people.
    Automobiles are important tools for modern national defense and industrial construction. Our First Automobile Manufacturing Plant alone needs more than four hundred automobiles during its construction process. The mechanization of agriculture also requires automobile transportation. Automobiles are important tools for branch-line transportation. To widely and deeply develop urban and rural trade and accelerate the turnover of industrial and agricultural products, automobiles also play an important role. Therefore, completing the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant on time or ahead of schedule is of great significance.
    China has used automobiles for thirty to forty years, but has never been able to manufacture them in a standardized way. In the past, China was merely a museum of various automobile brands from different countries. The only industry related to automobiles that had formed in China was the repair and parts industry. Regardless of how much positive impact this industry had on China's economy and technology, it was ultimately an appendage to foreign automobiles in the Chinese market. It could only guarantee the dumping of foreign automobiles and could not resist it.
    Only the victory of the people changed this situation. After the imperialists and their running dogs were expelled, the international capital's monopoly on the Chinese automobile market was broken. Now there is the possibility of establishing our own automobile production, and, with the recovery and development of the economy, there is also the necessity for automobile production. On this basis, the People's Government adopted the wise decision to build the first automobile manufacturing plant.
    II. The Question of How to Begin
    The difficulties facing the automobile factory are enormous. Although the Chinese working class, under the leadership of the Communist Party, has achieved brilliant victories on the battlefield and in the struggle for economic recovery, it is completely unfamiliar with our modern automobile industry. It is only with the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union that the First Automobile Factory has embarked on the path of construction.
    In the Soviet Union, there is a strong automobile industry built up since the first five-year plan. This industry not only stands at the forefront of the world in terms of product quality and production technology, but also, because it is located in the center of the world's peace and democracy camp, it has become the technical base for the development of the automobile industries of various countries in the peace and democracy camp. The technical assistance needed for the construction of China's automobile factory must and can only be obtained from this base.
    For three years, according to the agreements between China and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has made great efforts to assist China in building the automobile factory. More than twenty Soviet design units have undertaken the design of China's First Automobile Factory. Many Soviet machinery manufacturing plants are manufacturing equipment for China's First Automobile Factory. Some automobile factories have devoted all their efforts to carrying out construction process designs and manufacturing complete sets of tools, fixtures, and molds for China's First Automobile Factory. They have sent experts from their production posts to China and accepted Chinese workers and cadres to work as interns in the factories. Helping China to quickly produce automobiles has become a matter of great concern to the Soviet people.
    III. Current Issues
    Of course, Soviet support does not mean that we can relax our efforts. Building an automobile factory is an extremely complex and arduous task, and organizing and conducting production in the completed automobile factory is no less difficult than the construction project. The tasks facing the automobile factory not only require the greatest efforts of all the personnel in the factory, but also require the coordinated efforts of many industries across the country.
    Since last year, we have been involved in construction work. Under the care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the guidance of the higher-level Party committees and leading organs, and with the efforts of all the employees and the support of the people of the whole country, we have learned to construct according to Soviet drawings, learned mechanized factory-style construction methods, learned to compile and use construction organization designs, learned to implement planned management, learned to promote advanced technology, and learned to ensure quality, etc. Therefore, last year, we overfulfilled the construction plan, completing a volume of work equivalent to 13.7% of the total workload.
    However, the more arduous construction task is still this year. This year is a decisive and critical year for striving to complete the construction of the factory on schedule. This year, thirty-two projects in the factory area are under full construction. In terms of workload alone, it accounts for about 61.9% of the total workload, which is about five times that of last year. Important projects include the foundry, the forging shop, the body stamping shop, the motorcycle shop, the chassis shop, the woodworking shop, the auxiliary shops, the non-ferrous metals shop, and the model repair shop. The construction workload in the dormitory area is also about three times that of last year. To complete this task requires even greater efforts from our employees.
    Equipment installation will begin this year. The ordering, transportation, storage, inspection, and registration of a large number of equipment have been underway for a year, while issues such as installation plans, construction organization designs, integration with civil engineering and production, pre-installation and inspection, installation design, and inspection and acceptance have just begun. To properly install thousands of machine tools, hundreds of furnaces, forging and pressing equipment, tens of kilometers of conveyor belts, and thousands of non-standard equipment, it is necessary to master skilled installation techniques, and this is the fortress that we urgently need to overcome.
    Parallel to civil engineering and installation is production preparation work. Civil engineering and installation will prepare the factory buildings and machines, while production preparation will prepare the personnel, tools, materials, and the technology and organization that connect these five factors for production. In order to ensure that the state's investment in factory buildings and machines quickly takes effect, the complex production preparation work must be completed meticulously, promptly, and without any omissions. Starting this year, all the factory cadres are fully turning to this work.
    In the face of such a huge task, the support of the national industry is very important. The manpower, materials, and machinery for construction and installation come from all over the country - East China, Central South, Northeast, and North China. Nearly half of the factory's equipment is to be manufactured by brother machinery factories, of which about two thousand are non-standard equipment that has never been manufactured domestically and must be individually manufactured according to Soviet drawings. The thousands of types of materials required for automobile production, nearly five hundred types of outsourced products, and the thousands of types of standard tools that are frequently consumed, all require the cooperative supply of brother factories in the country, and most of them are products that cannot be produced now and must be solved through trial production or even expansion. The production of Chinese automobiles is a common undertaking of the entire Chinese industry. Only through everyone's joint efforts can the problems before and after production be solved.
    IV. The Ideal Factory
    The construction of the automobile factory is difficult, and production is even more difficult, but it is precisely because it is not easy that it is so precious to the people of the whole country. From the perspective of the people participating in construction and production, there is no happier moment than when the first automobile starts to roll off the assembly line. This ardent wish is not only due to the love of creative labor and the joy of completing tasks, but also because this factory is such a beautiful creation of mankind that anyone who understands it cannot help but develop feelings for it. As the chief design engineer said: It will be a factory as beautiful as a beauty.
    The construction of the First Automobile Factory is carried out under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, following the Soviet design and construction procedures. It incorporates the advanced experience of Soviet automobile production and implements the principles of socialist enterprise management. In this way, it not only has inherently beautiful characteristics, but also far exceeds the automobile factories of capitalist countries in terms of technical level.
    The most obvious feature of the design is its advanced technology. The process design of the factory's production departments is determined around a clear product plan, without the flexibility that the bourgeoisie has to retain because it is subject to the market. Therefore, under the same output conditions, the proportion of specialized equipment and the allocation rate of specialized tools, fixtures, and molds in our factory are much higher, and its labor productivity is naturally much higher.
    According to the production process, site conditions, and relationships in production, the designers cleverly combine the workshops of the entire factory. Due to the compact layout, the transportation process in production is shortened, thereby shortening the amount of labor and the production cycle of the product.
    The design is extremely thorough in reducing heavy manual labor and improving working conditions. The most tiring foundry and forging production processes have been completely mechanized. Furnace materials, sand, castings, and forgings do not require workers to operate against the force of gravity during the production process. Many combined machines are used in heat treatment to automatically quench and temper. Various conveyor belts are generally equipped in the parts processing process. The design of ventilation, lighting, heating, and safety is extremely superior.
    The design equips the factory with strong auxiliary production departments. Tools, repair, and power, each unit is equivalent to a medium-sized factory. This feature is significant in modern mass production factories. Since the basic production workshops have an extremely high load factor, the proportion of auxiliary production that ensures the constant operation of basic production must be increased. The result of this combination is improved production efficiency.
    In order to maintain a high level of production technology and quality, the design arranges for strong technical units. In the two workshops for testing and trial production, in addition to cooperating with regular production, six new types of automobiles can be manufactured and studied each year. Materials, technology, precision measurement, instruments, and electricity each have independent laboratories with the ability to conduct research work.
    All these features, combined with first-class architectural design, first-class machinery and equipment, and first-class specialized tools, fixtures, and molds, constitute an ideal socialist factory. This is the object of our construction.
    V. Direction of Effort
    The purpose of building a factory is for production. We not only require construction and installation to be carried out according to advanced designs, but also require that we can quickly enter advanced production after the factory is built.
    Therefore, it is not enough to have a strong affection for the factory. It is necessary to correctly train personnel, organize work, and prepare for production, so that when the factory is built, it can have first-class workers and cadres entering the factory, operating machines, using tools, and carrying out production. The completion of this task is the final and most important link in the victorious construction of the factory.
    On the basis of the smooth completion of construction, installation, and production preparation, the factory will quickly conduct adjustments and familiarize itself with production, master the processes that have not been carried out before and the technologies that have not been touched before, and solve the technical and organizational problems of manufacturing automobiles for the first time on Chinese soil.
    It is necessary to first concentrate all efforts to break through the production adjustment and familiarization stage, and then start learning how to organize and plan the extremely complex production process, how to ensure that production is carried out rhythmically and evenly, how to ensure quality and reduce waste, and how to improve labor productivity and reduce costs. As well as a series of problems in regular production. This will be a complex and varied task, a task that a socialist enterprise must constantly strive for.
    Although there is still a long way to go before the final completion of the factory and the smooth conduct of production, all the employees of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant have the confidence to overcome the obstacles lying on this road.

    在建设中的第一汽车制造厂
    第一汽车制造厂副厂长兼总工程师　孟少农
    一、不寻常的事件
    我国第一个汽车制造厂的建设正在日夜地进行着。这将是一座以世界第一流技术装备起来的工厂，从它的总装配线末端，优良的国产汽车将流水般地散布到辽阔的国土上去，为工农业生产、为国防建设、为广大人民的需要而奔驰。
    汽车是现代化国防和工业建设的重要工具，我们第一汽车制造厂在建设过程中，就需要四百多辆汽车。农业的机械化，也少不了汽车运输。汽车是支线运输的重要工具，要广泛地深入地开展城乡贸易，加速工农业产品的运转，汽车也起着重要作用。因此，按期或提早完成第一汽车制造厂的建设任务，是有着重要的意义的。
    中国使用汽车已有三四十年的历史，但从来不能定型地制造汽车，过去，中国只是各国汽车牌号的博物馆。在中国曾形成的惟一与汽车有关的工业是修理与配件工业。这种工业，不论它在中国的经济与技术方面起过多少积极的作用，但它毕究是外国汽车在中国市场上的一个附庸，它只能保证外国汽车的倾销，而不能与之相对抗。
    只有人民的胜利才改变了这一形势。在帝国主义和其走狗被驱逐之后，国际资本对中国汽车市场的独占才被打破。现在有了建立本国汽车生产的可能，而且，随着经济的恢复和发展，也有了汽车生产的必要。在这样的基础上人民政府采取了建设第一座汽车制造厂的英明决定。
    二、如何起始的问题
    横在汽车厂面前的困难是巨大的。虽然中国工人阶级在共产党的领导下曾经在战场上和在经济恢复的斗争中取得辉煌的胜利，但是对于我们现代化的汽车工业是全然生疏的。只是在伟大的苏联的无私帮助下，第一汽车厂才走上了建设的道路。
    在苏联，有从第一个五年计划建立起来的强大的汽车工业。这个工业不但在产品质量和生产技术方面都站在世界的最前列，而且，因为它处于世界和平民主阵营的中心，也就成为发展和平民主阵营各国汽车工业的技术基地。中国汽车厂建设所需要的技术援助，必须而且也只能从这个基地取得。
    三年来，根据中苏两国间的协议，苏联为了援助我国建设汽车厂，曾作了巨大的努力。苏联二十多个设计单位分担了我国第一汽车厂的设计。苏联很多机械制造厂为我国第一汽车厂制造设备，某些汽车厂拿出全副力量来为我国第一汽车厂进行施工工艺设计和制造全套工卡模具，他们从生产岗位上抽出专家派到中国，并接受中国工人干部进厂实习。帮助中国迅速生产汽车已成为苏联人民非常关心的事业。
    三、当前的课题
    当然，苏联的支援并不意味着我们可以放松努力。建设汽车厂是极端复杂艰巨的工作，而在已建好的汽车厂中组织和进行生产，其困难也不比建设工程少。摆在汽车厂前面的课题不但要求全厂人员尽到最大的努力，而且要求全国许多工业的配合努力。
    从去年起我们接触了建筑工作。在党中央、毛主席的关怀下，在上级党委及领导机关的指示下，在全体职工的努力和全国人民的支援下，我们学习了按苏联图纸施工，学习了机械化工场化的施工方法，学习了编制和运用施工组织设计，学习了贯彻计划管理，学习了推广先进技术和保证质量等等一系列的课题。因此，去年，我们超额完成了施工计划，完成的工作量相当于全部工作量的百分之十三点七。
    然而更艰巨的施工任务还在今年。今年，对争取按指定的时间完成建厂任务来说，是有决定性的关键的一年。今年工厂区域有三十二项工程全面施工，单从工作量来说，约占全部工作量的百分之六十一点九，约为去年的五倍。其中重要的项目有铸工场、锻工场、车身压制工场、摩托工场、底盘工场、木工场、辅助工场、有色金属工场、模型修理工场等。宿舍区域的施工工作量，也约为去年的三倍。要完成这个任务，是需要我们职工作更大的努力的。
    今年将要开始安装设备。大批设备的订货、运输、保管、检查、登记等工作已进行了一年，而安装计划、施工组织设计、与土建和生产的结合、预安装和检查、安装设计工作、以及检验验收等问题，现在刚刚开始。要装好数千台机床、数百台的炉、锻压、设备、数十公里长的输送带、数千台的非标准设备，必须掌握熟练的安装技术，而这就是我们亟待克服的堡垒。
    与土建安装平行的是生产准备工作。土建安装将准备好厂房和机器，生产准备则要准备好人员、工具、材料、以及将这五种因素贯穿起来进行生产的技术和组织。为要保证国家在厂房机器上的投资迅速起作用，头绪纷纭的生产准备工作必须细致、及时、毫无疏漏地完成。从今年起，全厂干部正以全力转向这一工作。
    在这样巨大的任务面前，全国工业的支援是非常重要的。建筑安装的人力、材料、机械来自全国各地——华东、中南、东北、华北。全厂近半数的设备要由兄弟机械厂承制，其中约二千台是国内没制造过，而要按苏联图纸个别制造的非标准设备。汽车生产所需的千多种材料，近五百种外制品、以及经常消耗的数千种标准工具，都需要国内兄弟厂的协作供应，而其中大部分是现在不能生产，必须经过试制或甚至进行扩建才能解决的产品。中国汽车的生产是全中国工业的共同事业，只有大家共同的努力才能解决生产前和生产后的问题。
    四、理想的工厂
    汽车厂的建设困难，生产更不易，但正是因为不易，它对于全国人民才是如此宝贵。从参加建设和生产的人们看来没有比汽车开始从总装配线上滚出来那一瞬间更快乐的时间了。这种热烈的愿望，不仅因为对创造性劳动的爱好，不仅因为完成任务的喜悦，而且因为这个工厂是这样优美的人类创造物，以致于凡是了解它的就不能不对它发生感情。正如总设计工程师说过的：它将是美人般的工厂。
    第一汽车厂的建设是在中国共产党的坚强领导下，按照苏联设计建厂的程序进行的。在它的设计中吸收了苏联汽车生产的先进经验，贯彻了社会主义企业经营管理的原则。这样，它就不但从本质上具有优美的特点，而且在技术水平上也远超出资本主义国家的汽车厂。
    设计中最明显的特点是技术的先进。全厂生产部门的工艺设计是围绕一个明确的产品方案决定的，毫没有资产阶级那种受制于市场而不得不保有的活动性。因此，在同样产量的条件下，我们厂的专门设备比例与专门工卡具配备率要高得多，其劳动生产率自然也要高得多。
    根据生产工艺、厂址条件以及生产中的关系，设计师把全厂各车间巧妙地结合起来。由于布置紧凑，生产中的运输过程缩短了，因之也缩短了劳动量和产品的生产周期。
    设计对减轻繁重的体力劳动和改善劳动条件做得极为彻底。最累的铸工和锻工生产过程已经完全机械化，炉料、砂子、铸件、锻件、在生产过程中完全不需要工人违抗重力的作用进行操作。热处理中采用了很多组合机，自动进行淬火配火。在零件加工过程中普遍配备了各种输送带。通风、照明、保暖、安全的设计都极其优越。
    设计给工厂配备了强大的辅助生产部门。工具、修理、动力、每个单位都相当于一个中型的工厂。这一特点在现代化的大量生产厂中是显著的。由于基本生产车间有极高的负荷率，保证基本生产经常不断的辅助生产比重就必须加大。这样结合的结果是提高了生产效率。
    为要保持生产的高度技术和质量水平，设计中安排了强大的技术单位。在试验和试制两个车间里，除配合经常的生产外，每年还能制造六辆新型汽车并加以研究。材料、工艺、精密度量、仪表、电气，各有独立的有进行研究工作能力的实验室。
    这一切特点，再加上头等的建筑设计、头等的机器设备、头等的专门工卡具，就构成了一个理想的社会主义工厂。这就是我们建设的对象。
    五、努力的方向
    建厂是为了生产，我们不仅要求按照先进的设计进行建筑安装，而且要求在建好后能迅速地进入先进的生产。
    因此，光有对工厂的热烈感情是不够的，必须正确地培养人员、组织工作、准备生产，使工厂建好时能有头等的工人和干部队伍进入工厂、操纵机器、使用工具、进行生产。这一任务的完成，是胜利建厂的最后而又最重要的环节。
    在建筑、安装、生产准备顺利完成的基础上，工厂将迅速地进行调整和熟习生产，把不曾进行过的过程、不曾接触过的技术掌握起来，解决第一次在中国土地上制造汽车的技术和组织问题。
    必须首先集中一切力量突破生产调整和熟悉这一关，然后着手学习如何组织和计划极端复杂的生产过程，如何保证生产有节奏均衡地不断进行，如何保证质量减少废品，如何提高劳动生产率和降低成本。以及一系列经常生产中的问题。这将是复杂多端的任务，一个社会主义企业须经常为之奋斗的任务。
    虽然目前距最后完成建厂和顺利进行生产，还有很长一段道路，但是第一汽车制造厂的全体职工有信心跨过横在这段道路上的障碍。
