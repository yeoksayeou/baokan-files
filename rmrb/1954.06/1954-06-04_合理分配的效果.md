    The Effect of Reasonable Distribution
    By our reporter Lü Jianzhong
    From the spring planting to the preparation for the wheat harvest, the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative in Guowangdu Village, Anyang County, Henan Province, launched the third phase of the production competition. The main content of this phase was to plant cotton well, protect the seedlings, and at the same time strengthen the later management of wheat fields to ensure the completion of the wheat production increase task.
    At the beginning of the competition, the co-op members worked as enthusiastically as in the first two phases of the production competition. However, when they saw the wheat, which promised a rich harvest all over the mountains and fields, they all had a concern in their hearts: how the wheat would be distributed this year and whether their actual income of grain would be more than in previous years.
    This is a major issue that concerns the actual interests of each co-op member and whether the cooperative can be consolidated and developed. Everyone had only heard that the cooperative would change the previous "land four-five, labor five-five" profit-sharing system to a fixed rent system this year, but no one knew what would come out of the fixed rent system. Households with more land always wanted to set the land rent higher, households with strong labor were afraid that land dividends would be too high and labor would not be reasonably rewarded, old co-op members felt that they had fertilized the land and new co-op members were taking advantage, and new co-op members whose wheat grew well felt that they were losing out because the wheat was distributed uniformly within the co-op.
    Originally, the cooperative's work evaluation and score-keeping system was not sound and reasonable enough. It was said to be fixed distribution and flexible recording, but in reality it was fixed distribution and fixed recording. At the same time, the score-keeping for female labor was also very sloppy, which affected the labor enthusiasm of the co-op members and caused a lot of wasted work and wasted labor. Therefore, the Cooperative Affairs Committee first focused on the first and second production teams, which had a better foundation, to pilot the system of contracting for cultivation and production and calculating work by piece. The experimental results showed that the five kinds of work, namely weeding wheat, watering wheat, chopping grass, and plowing land, saved 98 labor days compared with fixed distribution and fixed recording, and the quality of the work was also better. Therefore, after the third phase of the production competition began, the Cooperative Affairs Committee mobilized the co-op members to revise the production plan for 1954 to make it more realistic, in order to create conditions for the comprehensive implementation of contracting for cultivation and production and calculating work by piece.
    The result of the revision of the production plan was: the average yield per mu of the cooperative's 617 mu of wheat was required to increase from 338 jin in 1953 to 372 jin. ... The co-op members believed that the completion of this production increase task was certain based on the actual growth of wheat this year.
    "Why can the wheat yield increase this year?" The CCP Guowangdu Village Branch seized this question to educate the co-op members and implement the distribution system that takes labor as the main factor and takes land into account.
    At the beginning of the Party branch meeting, some Party members used "steady progress" and "Guowangdu has little land" as reasons to oppose the implementation of the fixed rent system. During the meeting, everyone was enlightened to recognize the class nature and social roots of the land dividend issue, and linked it to the Party's basic task in rural areas, which is to lead the vast number of peasants to gradually transition to a socialist society; the socialist principle of distribution is to each according to his work, and the current implementation of the distribution system that takes labor as the main factor is the practical content of helping peasants carry out socialist transformation. At the same time, everyone discussed the effects of the first and second production teams in the cooperative implementing contracting for cultivation and production and calculating work by piece, and found out the reasons for the wheat yield increase to illustrate the correctness and benefits of distributing dividends mainly based on labor. For example, this year all the wheat is densely planted. Dense planting of wheat first requires sufficient fertilizer. The co-op members gave full play to their labor enthusiasm and carried out two fertilizer accumulation campaigns, so that the cooperative's wheat had sufficient base fertilizer and was generally top-dressed twice; with fertilizer, there must also be sufficient water. Last winter and this spring, all the co-op members not only renovated the wells, but also led the masses of the whole village to dig and repair 2,700 zhang of canals and repair more than 20 sluice gates, turning dry land into paddy fields, so that the cooperative's wheat was watered three times in stages, plus diligent weeding and grass removal, and the fight against natural disasters, which made the cooperative's wheat much stronger than that outside the cooperative. For example, female co-op member He Xiuyun and her uncle He Cungui had two pieces of wheat land side by side. After the family split up last year, He Xiuyun joined the cooperative. Although He Cungui had labor, the mutual aid group was not as strong as the cooperative in terms of labor and sufficient processing and fertilization. Therefore, He Xiuyun's wheat was obviously thicker and bigger than He Cungui's, and taller. These facts made everyone clearly realize that distributing fruits mainly based on labor is not only completely reasonable, but also only by mainly based on labor can the labor enthusiasm of the co-op members be more fully exerted. The land yield increases year by year, and the labor income of the co-op members will also increase. Therefore, everyone unanimously agreed to implement the fixed rent system in the cooperative and formulated a reasonable distribution plan.
    The cooperative's land is divided into three grades and nine levels according to four conditions: distance from the location, quality of the soil, difficulty of cultivation, and fertility of the land. A land rent of about 26 percent of the actual output was also assessed. In this way, the total agricultural and sideline income of the cooperative this year is equivalent to 1,254,000 jin of millet. After deducting 240,000 jin for land investment and 130,000 jin for land rent (including public grain), the remaining 884,000 jin will be distributed by the co-op members based on the 44,000 labor days reported and discussed by the whole co-op members, and each labor day can get 20 jin. They adopt the method of one-time distribution within the cooperative for the whole year and pre-borrowing during the wheat season. The above plan was discussed and revised by Party and League member meetings, activist meetings, and co-op member meetings. Every household calculated its income based on it. The calculation results showed that every household in the cooperative's 144 households, except for a few widowed and childless households with no labor, had incomes that greatly exceeded any previous year. New co-op member Guo Zhenzong has 15 mu of land and 10 people in his family. His younger brother has returned home after being demobilized. The whole family has two male laborers and three female laborers. Last year, the total income was equivalent to 6,144 jin of millet. This year, he did 726 labor days throughout the year, and each labor day was distributed 20 jin of millet. Labor alone was distributed 14,520 jin of grain. Adding land dividends, the total income for the year was 16,260 jin of millet, more than 10,100 jin more than last year. Yang Youdi, an old co-op member and middle peasant with more land, heard from her son Wang Xuegong at the brick and tile kiln that a fixed rent system was to be implemented. Fearing that he would receive less grain this year, he anxiously went home and quarreled. Yang Youdi understood the meaning of distributing dividends mainly based on labor at the activist meeting and also calculated that her income this year was more than last year. Therefore, despite her son's anxiety, she said calmly:
   "What are you worried about? We rely on labor, not land."
   "Rely on labor? Last year you were just afraid that the land would be divided into less grain?" the son said unhappily.
    "Last year was last year. Aren't you always looking forward to socialism? More land dividends make lazy people, 'create capitalism'; more labor dividends make diligent people, 'create socialism.' This, this is transformation..." Yang Youdi patiently persuaded her son.
      "But you can't tie up your feet and walk to socialism!" The son's thinking was still not clear. So Yang Youdi calculated the detailed account for her son: the family of four has 15 and a half mu of land. Last year, they did 300 labor days throughout the year, and each labor day was divided into 9 jin of millet, a total of 2,700 jin. Each mu of land was divided into an average of 145 jin of millet, a total of 2,247 and a half jin. Adding the sideline income of 2,810 jin of millet, the total income for the year was equivalent to 7,757 and a half jin of millet, and the wheat income was 1,403 jin; this year, 360 labor days were done throughout the year, and each labor day was divided into 20 jin of millet, a total of 7,200 jin. Each mu of land was divided into an average of 116 jin of millet, a total of 1,798 jin. The total income for the year was equivalent to 8,998 jin of millet, 1,240 and a half jin more than last year, and the wheat season income was 1,900 jin, 497 jin more than last year.
    After this calculation, Wang Xuegong realized that his mother was right. He said happily: "If we work harder, we will get more grain this year. Everyone says that the state has set up a tractor station in our village. In the future, agricultural production cooperatives will improve step by step and implement distribution according to work. Life will be better than it is now. In this case, as long as we work hard, it doesn't matter if the land is not divided into dividends in the future!"
    After discussion and decision, the cooperative can harvest a total of 230,000 jin of wheat this year. Based on the total number of labor days throughout the year, each labor day is divided into 4 jin to calculate the amount that each household should be allocated. Then, 150 jin are left for each person. The remaining amount, after deducting public grain, seeds, livestock feed, and leaving a portion to take care of widowed and childless households in need and exchange back some coarse grains, will be sold to the state by the cooperative according to the combined contract, 75,000 jin, to support industrial construction.
    This distribution system has greatly improved the labor enthusiasm of the co-op members. Ensuring the realization of the annual grain and cotton production increase plan has become the common requirement of all co-op members. Therefore, the third phase of the production competition has been launched even more enthusiastically. When the wheat was filling, there was a drought, and the canal water could not be rotated. Everyone worked together to irrigate with well water. Every day, as soon as the east turned bright, a roar of well wheels resounded across the fields. They watered more than 400 mu of wheat in six days. The first production team has always maintained the honor of the model team. After watering their own wheat, they went to help other teams water. The Miao Qingrong women's group of the second production team won the red flag with the highest record of wheat watering in the cooperative. Then, the cotton seedlings were infested with aphids. They immediately studied the technology of thinning seedlings and replanting seedlings combined with pest control and plunged into a wave of eliminating aphids and protecting seedlings.
    Not only that, but another important harvest is that the co-op members have realized the value of labor and the importance of ensuring the quality of work through reasonable profit-sharing, and have proposed to seriously implement contracting for cultivation and production and calculate work by piece throughout the cooperative, and women also demand equal pay for equal work.
    The CCP Guowangdu Village Branch and the Cooperative Affairs Committee further strengthened the cooperative's organization and planning and improved various systems on the basis of the co-op members' ideological awareness and labor enthusiasm. In particular, in combination with the promotion of contracting for cultivation and production and calculating work by piece, they conducted in-depth and meticulous labor organization and production arrangements for the summer harvest and summer planting. They will further launch the fourth phase of the production competition centered on summer harvest and summer planting on the basis of the victory of the third phase competition.

    合理分配的效果
    本报记者　吕建中
    从春季播种到准备麦收的两个月当中，河南安阳县郭王度村先锋农业生产合作社开展了第三段生产竞赛。这段竞赛的主要内容是把棉花播种好，苗儿保护好，同时加强麦田后期管理，保证完成小麦增产任务。
    竞赛开始，社员们和前两段生产竞赛一样地干得挺起劲；但是当他们看到那满山遍野丰收在望的麦子时，都不约而同地产生了一桩心事，这就是今年的小麦怎样分配，自己实际收入的粮食究竟会不会比往年多的问题。
    这是关系着每个社员实际利益和合作社能否巩固发展的大问题。大家光听说今年社里要把去年的
  “土地四五，劳力五五”的比例分红制改为死租制，可是按死租制能分出个什么名堂来，谁也不蹬底。土地多的户总想把地租订高些，劳力强的户怕土地分红多了，劳力得不到合理的报酬，老社员觉得自己把土地经营肥了，新社员沾便宜，麦子长得好的新社员又感到麦子由社内统一分配自己吃亏。
    本来，社里的评工记分制度不够健全合理，说是死分活记，实为死分死记，同时对妇女劳力记分也很马虎，影响了社员的劳动积极性，产生不少窝工、浪费工现象，社务委员会便先在基础较好的第一、第二两个生产队重点试行包耕包产、按件计工，试验结果仅锄麦、浇麦、铡草、犁地五种活就比死分死记节省九十八个劳动日，活儿质量又好，因此第三段生产竞赛开始后，社务委员会便发动社员把一九五四年的生产计划修订得更切合实际，以便创造条件全面实行包耕包产，按件计工。
    生产计划修订的结果是：全社六百一十七亩小麦，每亩平均产量要求在一九五三年三百三十八斤的基础上提高到三百七十二斤。……社员们根据今年小麦生长的实际情况都认为这个增产任务的完成是有把握的。
    “今年的小麦为什么能够增产呢？”中共郭王度村支部就抓住了这个问题向社员进行教育，贯彻了以劳力为主兼顾土地的分配制度。
    党支部会议上，开始有一部分党员用“稳步前进”、“郭王度土地少”做理由来反对实行死租制，会议中启发大家认识土地分红问题的阶级性及其社会根源，联系到党在农村中的基本任务是领导广大农民逐步过渡到社会主义社会；社会主义的分配原则是按劳取酬，而现在实行以劳力为主的分配制度就是帮助农民进行社会主义改造的实际内容。同时，大家又讨论了社里第一、第二两生产队实行包耕包产，按件计工的效果，并找出小麦增产原因来说明以劳力为主分红的正确性及其好处。如今年全是密植小麦，密植麦首先要肥料充足，社员们发挥劳动积极性开展了两次积肥运动，使全社小麦上足了底肥，又普遍上了两次追肥；有了肥料还必须有充足的水分，去冬今春全体社员除整修水井外，又带动全村群众挖修了两千七百丈渠道，修补了二十多个闸口，变旱田为水田，做到全社小麦分期浇了三次水，再加上勤锄、勤拔草，向自然灾害作斗争，就使合作社小麦比社外强的多。比如女社员贺秀云和她叔父贺存贵并摆着两块麦地，去年分家后，贺秀云入了社，贺存贵虽然有劳力，但互助组不如合作社劳力强、加工施肥足，因此贺秀云那块小麦就显然比贺存贵的麦杆粗、穗大，高出一头。这些事实使大家清楚地认识到以劳为主分配果实不仅完全合理，而且只有以劳为主，才能更充分地发挥社员的劳动积极性。土地产量一年比一年提高，社员的劳动收入也就越多。因此，大家便一致同意社内实行死租制，并制订了合理的分配方案。
    全社土地按位置远近，土质好坏，耕作难易，地力肥瘦四个条件分成三等九级，又评定了约占实际产量百分之二十六的地租，这样全社今年农、副业总收入折小米一百二十五万四千斤，扣除土地投资二十四万斤，地租十三万斤（包括公粮在内），余下的八十八万四千斤，由全社社员自报公议的全年四万四千个劳动日分红，每个劳动日可得二十斤。他们采用社内全年一次分配，麦季预借的办法。以上方案通过党、团员会，积极分子会，社员会等讨论、修订，家家户户都根据它计算了自己的收入，计算结果，全社一百四十四户除个别孤寡无劳力户外，每户收入都大大超过以往任何一年。新社员郭振宗，十五亩地，十口人，弟弟复员回家了，全家共有两个男劳力，三个女劳力。去年全年收入折小米六千一百四十四斤，今年全年做七百二十六个劳动日，每个劳动日分二十斤小米，光劳动力就分一万四千五百二十斤粮，加上土地分红，全年共可收入小米一万六千二百六十斤，比去年多收入一万零一百多斤。地较多的中农老社员杨有娣，她儿子王学功在砖瓦窑上听说要实行死租制，怕今年分粮少，焦躁得回家吵闹，杨有娣在积极分子会议上弄懂了以劳为主分红的意义，也计算了自己今年的收入比去年多，因此尽管她儿子焦急，她却不慌不忙的笑道：
   “您急啥，咱靠劳动，不靠土地。”
   “靠劳动，去年您光怕土地分粮少？”儿子没好气。
    “去年是去年。您不是成天盼社会主义吗？土地分红多了出懒人，‘出资本主义’；劳力分红多了出勤人，‘出社会主义’。这，这是改造……”杨有娣耐心地说服儿子。
      “可是也不能扎起?子来往社会主义走！”儿子的思想仍不通。于是杨有娣便算细账给儿子听：全家四口人，十五亩半地，去年全年做了三百个劳动日，每个劳动日分九斤小米，共分二千七百斤，每亩土地平均分一百四十五斤小米，共分二千二百四十七斤半，加上副业收入二千八百一十斤小米，全年共收入折小米七千七百五十七斤半，麦子收入一千四百零三斤；今年，全年做三百六十个劳动日，每个劳动日分二十斤小米，共分七千二百斤，每亩土地平均分一百一十六斤小米，共分一千七百九十八斤，全年共收入折小米八千九百九十八斤，比去年多收入一千二百四十零半斤，麦季收入一千九百斤，比去年多分四百九十七斤。
    这一算，王学功才明白了母亲是对的。便高兴地说：“咱若再多劳动，今年分的粮还多。大家都说国家在咱村设立了拖拉机站，将来农业生产合作社步步提高，实行按劳取酬，生活比现在还要好。这么说，只要好好劳动，将来土地不分红也没啥！”
    经过讨论决定，全社今年共可收小麦二十三万斤，按全年劳动日总数，以每个劳动日分四斤计算出各户应分配的数目，然后每口人留下一百五十斤，下余的除去公粮、种籽、牲口饲料以及留下一部分照顾孤寡困难户和调换回一部分粗粮外，由社里按照结合合同统一卖给国家七万五千斤，支援工业建设。
    这个分配制度大大提高了社员们的劳动积极性。保证全年粮棉增产计划的实现，就更成为全体社员的共同要求，因此第三段生产竞赛也就开展得更加热烈。小麦正在灌浆的时候，天旱了，渠水又轮不过来，大家便一齐动手用井水灌溉，每天东方刚亮，遍野就响起一片呼啦啦的辘轳声。他们六天的工夫浇完了四百多亩麦。第一生产队始终保持着模范队的荣誉，自己浇完了再去帮助别队浇，第二生产队苗清荣妇女小组以全社浇麦的最高纪录夺得了红旗。接着，棉苗生了蚜虫，他们又立刻研究了间苗、补苗结合治虫的技术，投入了灭蚜保苗热潮。
    不仅如此，还有一个重要收获是社员们通过合理分红体会到劳力的可贵，和保证做活质量的重要，纷纷提出认真在全社实行包耕包产，按件记工，妇女也要求同工同酬。
    中共郭王度村支部和社务委员会就在社员们这种思想觉悟和劳动积极性的基础上，进一步加强了合作社的组织性与计划性，健全了各种制度。尤其是结合推行包耕包产，按件计工制度，深入细致地进行了夏收夏种的劳力组织和生产安排。他们将在第三段竞赛的胜利基础上进一步开展以夏收夏种为中心的第四段生产竞赛。
