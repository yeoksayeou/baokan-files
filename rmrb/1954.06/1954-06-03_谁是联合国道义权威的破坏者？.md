In the Geneva Conference's discussion on the Korean issue, despite Foreign Minister Nam Il initially proposing a fair and reasonable plan for a comprehensive solution to the problem, and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai recently putting forward constructive supplementary suggestions, the United States and its followers have for more than a month continuously brandished the illegal UN resolutions they created, refusing to negotiate and blocking the path to any agreement. The representatives of China, the Soviet Union, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have, in the course of the discussion, demonstrated with irrefutable facts that, due to manipulation by the United States, the United Nations has been placed in the position of a belligerent party in Korea, and has lost its qualification and moral authority to handle the Korean issue fairly. It is very clear that the United States' insistence on imposing illegal UN resolutions on the Geneva Conference is merely a tactic to deliberately create a stalemate in the conference.

Naturally, this attitude of the United States cannot but be judged in the court of world opinion. American diplomats are scrambling to find ways to shirk responsibility. They cannot defend their position on the substantive issues of the Korean question, because the position they insist on is to refuse to withdraw American troops from South Korea, interfere in Korean internal affairs, and prevent the Korean people from solving their own problems. This is fundamentally untenable. Finding themselves in a situation where their arguments are exhausted and their reasoning is weak, American diplomats have no choice but to fabricate rumors and slanders to mislead people. The American propaganda machine, on instructions, is thus vehemently vilifying the so-called "Communist delegation" for "despising" and "attacking" the authority of the United Nations, and attempting to "destroy" the United Nations. This propaganda even became the main content of the speech made by US representative Smith at the plenary session of the Geneva Conference on May 28. At this plenary session discussing the Korean issue, Smith completely avoided talking about the substantive issues discussed at the meeting, and instead spoke at length about how the United States "respects" the "authority and moral strength of the United Nations."

Such remarks by Smith can only be described with these words: hypocrisy and shamelessness. Who is the saboteur of the United Nations' moral authority? Who despises the UN Charter and has placed the UN in its current humiliating state? Who has deprived the United Nations of its ability to handle the Korean issue? Isn't it the United States itself?

According to the provisions of the United Nations Charter, the United Nations is a global organization aimed at maintaining international peace and security. However, in the more than eight years of the United Nations' history since its establishment, it has been filled with records of the United States attacking and undermining the United Nations Charter. The United States has consistently obstructed the United Nations from resolving major issues related to international peace and security, such as disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, obstructed the United Nations from fairly and peacefully resolving international disputes, and obstructed the United Nations from supporting the just demands of colonial peoples. In a word, the United States obstructs the United Nations from fulfilling its responsibilities and exerting its moral strength. On the contrary, the United States has tried its best to undermine the moral authority of the United Nations, turning the United Nations into a tool of the US State Department and a tool for the United States to carry out aggression and war. On October 24, 1950, the then US Assistant Secretary of State Rusk publicly stated in a speech: "We are the United Nations. There is no great organization at Lake Success (the address of the United Nations headquarters at the time). When we refer to the United Nations, we mean ourselves." This is an open expression of the United States' attitude towards the United Nations. And whenever the United Nations does not completely comply with the will of the United States, US senators will utter a barrage of shouts to withdraw from the United Nations and stop paying UN dues to intimidate and threaten the United Nations.

The United States will stop at nothing to achieve its goals. An important cornerstone of the United Nations organization is the principle of unanimity among the great powers. According to the United Nations Charter, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and China—bear special responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. However, the United States has consistently tried its best to undermine the principle of unanimity among the great powers. The United States manipulates the mechanical majority in the United Nations, consistently refusing to restore the legitimate seat and rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and forcibly keeps the Kuomintang corpse in the United Nations. Can the current United Nations organization, without a representative from China, such a world power, become a truly global organization? Obviously, this situation seriously undermines the credibility of the United Nations and deprives the United Nations of the moral strength to handle the Korean issue and other Asian issues. And the United States is not satisfied with this. The United States has also launched a movement to amend the United Nations Charter, as some Western European newspapers have pointed out, the United States' intention is to completely turn the United Nations into an "anti-communist club."

The United States has consistently undermined the United Nations Charter and interfered in the internal affairs of other countries under the guise of the United Nations. In the Korean incident, the United States placed the United Nations in a particularly humiliating position. After the United States launched an armed intervention war in Korea, it manipulated the United Nations to approve the United States' aggression against Korea. Under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations ignored the United States' occupation of China's Taiwan and instead slandered China as an aggressor. The flag of the United Nations was used to cover up American aggression. The American "Newsweek" published an interview with the American Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Lodge, on October 12, 1953, in which he shamelessly discussed the "value" of the United Nations: "Besides the United States, fifteen United Nations member states have sent about two divisions of troops to Korea... According to the standards of World War II, these two divisions of troops would cost 600 million US dollars per year. Estimating the value of the United Nations in purely financial terms, the United States saves 600 million US dollars annually, while the United States pays only 25 million US dollars to the United Nations. This is not a bad deal." According to Lodge's statement, the "value" of an institution that maintains international peace and security lies in its ability to save the United States 600 million US dollars, while also finding cheap cannon fodder for the United States' war of aggression. This is what Smith calls the United States' "respect" for the "moral strength of the United Nations"! It is precisely because the United States has made the United Nations a belligerent party in the Korean incident that the United Nations has lost its ability to handle the Korean issue.

Now, the United States is still carrying out new conspiracies to undermine the moral authority of the United Nations. The United States is not only using the United Nations to undermine the discussion on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, but is also attempting to use the United Nations to undermine the discussion on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. The United States is actively plotting to manipulate the United Nations to discuss the Indochina issue, hoping to take the opportunity to brew a replica of the Korean incident, once again steal the flag of the United Nations to cover up the United States' expansion of the Indochina war, and cover up the United States' conspiracy to promote colonialism by force in Southeast Asia.

All those who cherish the cause of peace and international cooperation and are concerned about the fate of the United Nations must stop the United States' various activities that undermine the prestige and moral standing of the United Nations. The position adhered to by the Soviet Union, China, and other peace-loving countries is this: the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations must be restored, the United Nations must be returned to the path stipulated in the Charter, and the United Nations must be freed from the humiliating position in which the United States has placed it, and restored to a world organization for maintaining international peace and security.

    谁是联合国道义权威的破坏者？
    新华社评论员　江南
    在日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论中，尽管南日外务相一开始就提出了全面解决问题的公平合理的方案，周恩来外长最近又提出了建设性的补充建议，但是一个多月以来，美国和它的追随者一直抬着它们一手制造出来的联合国非法决议，来拒绝协商，堵塞达成任何协议的道路。中国、苏联和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表在讨论过程中，已经以无可辩驳的事实说明，由于美国的操纵，联合国已被置于朝鲜交战一方的地位，失去了公平处理朝鲜问题的资格和道义力量。十分清楚，美国坚持要把联合国非法决议强加在日内瓦会议上，不过是蓄意制造会议僵局的一种手法。
    自然，美国这种态度不能不在世界舆论的法庭上受到审判。美国外交官们急忙想办法来推卸责任。在朝鲜问题的实质问题上，他们是无法为自己的立场辩护的，因为他们所坚持的立场是拒绝从南朝鲜撤出美国军队、干涉朝鲜内政、阻止朝鲜人民自己解决自己问题。这是根本站不住脚的。辞穷理屈的美国外交官们只好造谣和诽谤，来迷惑人们。接到指示的美国宣传机器于是大肆诬蔑说什么“共产党代表团”在日内瓦“蔑视”、“攻击”联合国的权威，企图“毁灭”联合国。这种宣传甚至成为美国代表史密斯在日内瓦会议五月二十八日的全体会议上的发言的主要内容。在这次讨论朝鲜问题的全体会议上，史密斯对会议所讨论的实质问题完全避开不谈，而长篇累牍地说美国如何“尊重”“联合国的权力和道义力量”。
    对于史密斯的这种论调只能用这样的字眼来形容：伪善和无耻。谁是联合国道义权威的破坏者呢？谁蔑视联合国宪章，而使联合国处于目前的屈辱状态中呢？谁使联合国丧失了处理朝鲜问题的能力呢？难道不正就是美国自己吗？
    按照联合国宪章的规定，联合国是旨在维护国际和平和安全的世界性组织。而在联合国成立以来八年多的历史中，却充满着美国攻击和破坏联合国宪章的记录。美国一贯阻挠联合国解决裁减军备、禁止原子武器等有关国际和平和安全的重大问题，阻挠联合国公正地和平解决国际争端，阻挠联合国支持殖民地人民的正义要求。一句话，美国阻挠联合国尽到它的职责、发挥它的道义力量。相反地，美国却竭力破坏联合国的道义权威，把联合国沦为美国国务院的工具，沦为美国进行侵略及战争的
  一个工具。一九五○年十月二十四日，当时的美国助理国务卿鲁斯克公开发表演说说：“我们就是联合国。在成功湖（当时联合国总部的地址）并没有什么伟大的组织。当我们指联合国时，那就是指的我们自己。”这就是美国对待联合国的态度的露骨表白。而每当联合国不完全顺从美国的意旨的时候，美国参议员们就要发出一阵退出联合国、停止交纳联合国会费的叫嚷，来对联合国进行恐吓和威胁。
    美国为了达到它的目的，是不顾一切的。联合国组织的重要的基石就是大国一致原则。根据联合国宪章，联合国安全理事会五常任理事国苏联、美国、英国、法国和中国对维护国际和平和安全负有特殊的责任。但是，美国却一贯竭力破坏大国一致原则。美国操纵在联合国中的机械多数，一直拒绝恢复中华人民共和国在联合国应有的地位和权利，强把国民党僵尸继续安置在联合国中。中国这样一个世界大国没有代表在联合国中，目前这样的联合国组织难道能够成为真正的世界性组织吗？很明显，这种情况就严重地破坏了联合国的威信，并使联合国丧失了处理朝鲜问题及其他亚洲问题的道义力量。而美国还不满足于此。美国还发动了修改联合国宪章的运动，如西欧一些报纸所指出的，美国的企图是要把联合国完全变为一个“反共俱乐部”。
    美国一贯破坏联合国宪章，假借联合国的名义来干涉别国内政。在朝鲜事件上，美国把联合国置于特别屈辱的地位。美国发动武装干涉朝鲜的战争以后，操纵联合国批准了美国对于朝鲜的侵略。在美国操纵下，联合国无视美国侵占中国台湾，反而诽谤中国为侵略者。联合国的旗帜被用来掩饰美国的侵略。美国“新闻周刊”在一九五三年十月十二日曾刊载美国常驻联合国代表洛奇的一篇谈话，其中无耻地谈论联合国的“价值”说：“除美国外，十五个联合国会员国派遣了约两师军队去朝鲜。……按第二次世界大战中的标准计算，这两师军队每年要化费六亿美元。用纯粹财政经费来估计联合国的价值，美国这样每年就节省了六亿美元，而美国交纳给联合国的不过二千五百万美元。这不是一宗坏的交易。”照洛奇这种说法，一个维护国际和平和安全的机构的“价值”就在于它能替美国省下六亿美元，同时又替美国找到侵略战争的廉价炮灰。这就是史密斯所谓美国对“联合国的道义力量”的
  “尊重”！正是由于美国使联合国在朝鲜事件中成了这样的交战一方，才使联合国丧失了处理朝鲜问题的能力。
    现在，美国还在实行着破坏联合国道义权威的新阴谋。美国不仅在利用联合国来破坏日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论，而且正在企图利用联合国来破坏关于恢复印度支那和平问题的讨论。美国正在积极阴谋操纵联合国来讨论印度支那问题。希图借此来酝酿制造朝鲜事件的翻版，再度盗用联合国的旗帜来掩饰美国扩大印度支那战争，掩饰美国在东南亚用武力推行殖民主义的阴谋。
      一切珍视和平和国际合作事业、关心联合国的命运的人们必须制止美国毁坏联合国的威信和道义地位的种种活动。苏联、中国和其他爱好和平国家坚持的就是这样的立场：必须恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位，必须使联合国回到宪章所规定的道路上去，必须使联合国摆脱美国使它所处的屈辱地位，而恢复成为维护国际和平和安全的世界机构。
