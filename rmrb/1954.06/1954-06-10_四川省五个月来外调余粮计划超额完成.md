Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, June 9th. Sichuan Province has improved its grain transportation work, and the grain out-transfer plan for January to May has been overfulfilled by 3.04%.

This year, the transportation departments in Sichuan Province have increased the number of vehicles for transporting grain and have made grain transportation their primary task. The state-owned grain departments in Sichuan Province have also greatly strengthened the planning of grain transfer due to having a clear understanding of the grain situation in the province and adjusting transportation routes. The phenomena of grain waiting for ships and roundabout transportation of grain, which were common in the past, have now been reduced. On inland rivers such as the Fujiang River and the Jialing River, grain is generally not transshipped midway.

Sichuan Province's grain output last year exceeded the highest level before liberation. This year, in addition to meeting the needs of the urban and rural people within the province, there will be more surplus grain transferred out than in previous years. From January to May this year, the amount of surplus grain transferred out of Sichuan Province increased by 150% compared to the same period last year.

    四川省五个月来外调余粮计划超额完成
    【新华社成都九日电】四川省改进粮食运输工作，一到五月份的外调余粮计划已超额百分之三点零四完成。
    今年，四川省交通部门增加了运输粮食的交通工具，并以运输粮食作为首要任务。四川省国营粮食部门也由于对全省的粮食情况摸了底，以及调整了运输路线，因而大大加强了粮食调运的计划性。过去常有的粮等船和粮食迂回运输的现象现已减少。在涪江、嘉陵江等内河，一般已做到了粮食不中途转运。
    四川省去年粮食产量超过了解放前的最高水平，今年除满足省内城乡人民的需要外，将有比往年更多的余粮外调。今年一到五月份，四川省的余粮外调数量比去年同期增加一倍半。
