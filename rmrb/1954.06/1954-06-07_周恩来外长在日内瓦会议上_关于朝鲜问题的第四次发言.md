Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's Fourth Speech on the Korean Question at the Geneva Conference

Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates:

As early as the second day of the Geneva Conference, DPRK Foreign Minister Nam Il put forward three specific proposals for the peaceful settlement of the Korean question. These proposals were supported by the Soviet and Chinese delegations. Anyone without prejudice cannot but admit that Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposals provide a broad possibility for the Korean people to restore the unity of their country through genuine free elections. On May 22, the delegation of the People's Republic of China, in the spirit of seeking a way to reach an agreement, put forward a supplementary proposal for international supervision of free elections in Korea by neutral countries to Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal, which promoted the progress of the conference. However, the representative of the Republic of Korea put forward on the same day a proposal aimed at unifying Korea by the Rhee Syngman clique by means of foreign force. Obviously, such a proposal cannot provide a reasonable basis for the peaceful settlement of the Korean question.

The representatives of the United States and some other countries have attempted to support the Republic of Korea's proposal with illegal resolutions of the United Nations. We have repeatedly pointed out that the United Nations has nothing to do with this conference. This conference is being held to seek other ways to peacefully resolve the Korean question. In fact, a common basis for peacefully resolving the Korean question can be found.

At our meeting, no one opposed the consolidation of peace in Korea, and everyone acknowledged that the purpose of the meeting was to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. Everyone said that Korea should be unified. In order to achieve the unification of Korea, everyone believed that free elections should be held throughout Korea. This election will be conducted in accordance with the principle of proportional representation. Even on the issue of the regular withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Korea, only a few representatives expressed different opinions in principle. As Mr. Eden, the representative of the United Kingdom, pointed out on May 13, with so many common foundations, we should not feel disappointed in seeking a solution. Some people believe that since there is no bloodshed in Korea, the further peaceful resolution of the Korean question is not urgent, so they openly advocate delaying the resolution of the Korean question. We cannot agree with this view. The Korean question is so closely related to the peace and security of the Far East and the world that the peaceful resolution of the Korean question cannot be delayed. At the same time, since we have these common foundations, we should strive to seek concrete ways to solve the problem, and we should not allow the proposal of the representative of the Republic of Korea to become an obstacle in our search for a way to reach an agreement.

The representative of the Republic of Korea claims that his government represents the majority of the Korean people. If this is the case, the South Korean government does not have to be afraid of holding genuine free elections throughout Korea to achieve the unification of Korea. However, the representative of the Republic of Korea opposes the establishment of an all-Korean body jointly by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea based on the principle of mutual consultation to prepare for and hold free elections throughout Korea. The South Korean government is attempting to manipulate the Korean elections again in the name of the United Nations. It even attempts to impose the constitution of the Republic of Korea on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Moreover, it opposes the withdrawal of the United Nations forces, mainly the American troops, before the all-Korean elections. This proves that the South Korean government itself does not believe that it represents the majority of the Korean people. The South Korean government is afraid of achieving the unification of Korea through genuine free elections, and it attempts to rely on the illegal resolutions of the United Nations and foreign armed forces to extend Rhee Syngman's rule to the entire Korea. This not only violates the principle of the Korean people solving the Korean question themselves, but also fundamentally subverts the democratic basis of free elections. Therefore, it is not surprising that even a "New York Times" reporter could not help but admit in a dispatch on May 28 that in the Republic of Korea's proposal, "the real point of contention—that is, giving the Korean people an opportunity to elect a government through genuine free elections and unite their country under this government—is blurred."

Free elections throughout Korea are the Korean people's own business. Therefore, Foreign Minister Nam Il's suggestion that an all-Korean committee composed of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea should prepare for and hold all-Korean elections is completely reasonable. As Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out in his speech on April 29, "The solution to the Korean question is mainly the Korean people's own business. Any solution imposed on the Korean people by other countries cannot satisfy the Korean people, nor can it contribute to a lasting solution to the Korean question."

It is only because of the fact that Korea has been divided into two parts for many years and the sharpening of relations between North and South Korea caused by the war that we suggest that neutral countries assist the all-Korean committee in supervising free elections throughout Korea. Some people advocate that the United Nations should supervise free elections throughout Korea, which is untenable. We have repeatedly pointed out that the United Nations is a belligerent party in the Korean War and has long lost its qualification and moral strength to deal with the Korean question fairly. In the Korean Armistice Agreement, the belligerent parties agreed that the Supervisory Commission should be composed of neutral countries that did not participate in the Korean War, rather than the United Nations, which was one of the belligerent parties, to supervise the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. This is by no means accidental. In the ten months of the Korean armistice, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission played a positive role in assisting the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, through unanimous agreement, formulated effective procedures for supervising and inspecting the rotation of military personnel and the replacement of war materials entering and leaving Korea, established regular inspections at specific rear ports in North and South Korea, and conducted special investigations on requests from both sides to investigate incidents of violations of the agreement in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement. Although the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission encountered some difficulties in its work, its contributions and achievements cannot be ignored. Since an international organization like the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission can supervise the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, there is no reason why it cannot properly supervise free elections throughout Korea.

The withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Korea is a prerequisite for the Korean people to be able to freely express their will in national elections without foreign interference. The representative of the Republic of Korea repeated the claim of the American representative and slandered the Chinese People's Volunteers once again in order to oppose the just proposal to withdraw all foreign armed forces from Korea. This clamor of the representative of the Republic of Korea cannot change the justice of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the slightest. In fact, it is precisely the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that have consistently advocated the simultaneous withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Korea. On this very day when we are discussing the peaceful resolution of the Korean question, the Republic of Korea and the United States are still unwilling to withdraw the American troops together with all other foreign troops from Korea. Isn't this enough to prove that they are attempting to continue to keep the American troops in Korea to interfere in Korean internal affairs and threaten the peace of Korea and the security of China? However, the claims of the American representative and the representative of the Republic of Korea are obviously contrary to the wishes of the people of all countries who have their children in Korea. On May 7, the representative of New Zealand said that he was convinced that the countries attending this meeting were looking forward to the day when their troops would be withdrawn from Korea. The representative of Australia said on April 29 that he hoped that on the basis of satisfactory agreements and strong constraints, it would be possible to start withdrawing troops at an earlier date. The representative of the United Kingdom also said on May 13: "We have a common hope that we will withdraw our troops from Korea as soon as we can withdraw our troops without endangering peace." It can be seen that the desire to withdraw foreign armed forces from Korea also exists among the parties concerned in the United Nations forces.

Some people say that the withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Korea will affect the peace of Korea. This statement is unfounded. In order to prevent the recurrence of the Korean War, Foreign Minister Nam Il suggested that the countries most concerned about peace in the Far East should undertake the obligation to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea in order to promote the realization of the task of a unified Korean state. Therefore, we believe that there is no reason why this meeting cannot reach an appropriate agreement on the issue of the regular withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Korea and the guarantee of the peaceful development of Korea by the countries most concerned about peace in the Far East.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 5th - The discussion on the peaceful settlement of the Korean question at the Geneva Conference has lasted for more than a month, and the peace-loving people of all countries are hoping that our meeting can achieve positive results. We should strive to reach an agreement on the peaceful settlement of the Korean question on the basis of the existing common ground. We should not let down the hopes of the people of all countries.

### 周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上  关于朝鲜问题的第四次发言

    周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上
    关于朝鲜问题的第四次发言主席、各位代表先生：
    早在日内瓦会议开始的第二天，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相就提出了和平解决朝鲜问题的三项具体建议。这些建议得到了苏联和中国的代表团的支持。任何没有成见的人都不能不承认，南日外务相的建议提供了朝鲜人民经由真正的自由选举去重新恢复他们国家统一的广阔的可能性。在五月二十二日，中华人民共和国代表团本着努力寻求协议途径的精神，对南日外务相的建议提出了由中立国对朝鲜的自由选举进行国际监察的补充建议，推动了会议的进展。但大韩民国的代表却在同日提出了一个旨在由李承晚集团凭借外力统一朝鲜的建议。很显然，这样的建议不可能提供和平解决朝鲜问题的合理的基础。
    美国和其他一些国家的代表企图用联合国的非法决议来支持大韩民国的建议。我们已一再指出，联合国和我们这个会议毫无关系。我们这个会议是为了另谋和平解决朝鲜问题的途径而举行的。事实上，和平解决朝鲜问题的共同基础是可以找到的。
    在我们会议上，没有人反对朝鲜的和平应该得到巩固，并且大家承认，会议的目的是要达到朝鲜问题的和平解决的。大家都说朝鲜应该统一。为实现朝鲜的统一，大家多认为应该举行全朝鲜的自由选举。这个选举并将要按照人口比例的原则进行。就是对于从朝鲜定期撤出一切外国武装力量的问题，也只有少数的代表在原则上表示了不同的意见。诚如联合王国代表艾登先生在五月十三日所指出过的一样，有了这许多共同基础，我们不应对求得解决感觉失望。有些人以为在朝鲜既不流血了，朝鲜问题进一步的和平解决已不迫切，因此他们公开主张拖延朝鲜问题的解决。我们不能同意这种看法。朝鲜问题是如此密切地关系着远东及世界的和平和安全，和平解决朝鲜问题不容许拖延。同时，我们既然有了这些共同基础，我们更应该努力寻求具体解决问题的道路，而不应该让大韩民国代表的建议成为我们在寻求协议的途径上的一个障碍。
    大韩民国的代表声称他的政府代表着大多数的朝鲜人民。果真如此，南朝鲜政府就不必害怕在全朝鲜举行真正的自由选举，以实现朝鲜的统一了。但是，大韩民国的代表却反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国根据双方协商的原则共同成立全朝鲜机构，去筹备和举行全朝鲜的自由选举。南朝鲜政府企图再次假借联合国的名义来操纵朝鲜的选举。它甚至企图将大韩民国的宪法也强加于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。不仅如此，它还反对在全朝鲜选举前撤出联合国军，主要的是美国军队。这就证明：南朝鲜政府自己也不相信它本身是代表大多数朝鲜人民的。南朝鲜政府害怕经过真正的自由选举实现朝鲜的统一，它企图依靠联合国的非法决议和外国武装力量将李承晚的统治推广到整个朝鲜。这不仅违反了朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜问题的原则，而且根本推翻了自由选举的民主基础。因此，毫不奇怪，就是“纽约时报”的一位记者在他五月二十八日的一篇通讯里也不能不承认，在大韩民国的建议里，“真正的争执之点——就是给朝鲜人民一个机会，用真正的自由选举选举出一个政府，把他们的国家统一于这个政府之下——却被模糊过去了。”
    全朝鲜的自由选举是朝鲜人民自己的事情。因此南日外务相建议由朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国双方组成的全朝鲜委员会去筹备和举行全朝鲜选举是完全合理的。这正如苏联外长莫洛托夫在他四月二十九日的发言里所指出过的，“朝鲜问题的解决主要是朝鲜人民自己的事情。其他国家强加于朝鲜人民的任何解决办法都不能满足朝鲜人民，也不能有助于朝鲜问题的持久解决。”
    只是由于多年来朝鲜被分为两部分和由于战争所引起的南北朝鲜关系尖锐化的事实，我们才建议，由中立国去协助全朝鲜委员会，监察全朝鲜的自由选举。有人主张由联合国来监察全朝鲜的自由选举，这是站不住的。我们已多次指出，联合国是朝鲜战争中的交战一方，早已失去了公平处理朝鲜问题的资格和道义力量。在朝鲜停战协定中，交战双方协议由未参加朝鲜战争的中立国家组成监察委员会，而并非由交战一方的联合国来监察朝鲜停战协定的实施，这决不是偶然的。在朝鲜停战的十个月中，中立国监察委员会对于协助朝鲜停战协定的实施起了它的积极作用。中立国监察委员会经由一致协议制订了监督和视察出入朝鲜的军事人员的轮换和作战物资的替换的有效程序，在南北朝鲜的特定后方口岸建立了经常的视察，并对双方按照停战协定的规定所提出的调查违反协定事件的要求，进行了特别调查。中立国监察委员会在它的工作中虽然遭遇到了若干困难，但是它的贡献和成绩是不容抹煞的。像中立国监察委员会这样的国际机构既然能够监察朝鲜停战协定的实施，也就没有任何理由不可能对全朝鲜的自由选举进行适当的监察。
      一切外国武装力量撤出朝鲜，是朝鲜人民在全国选举中能够自由表示意志而不受外力干涉的先决条件。大韩民国的代表重复美国代表的主张，为了反对从朝鲜撤出一切外国武装力量的公正建议，又一次对中国人民志愿军进行了诽谤。大韩民国的代表的这种叫嚣丝毫也不能改变中国人民志愿军的正义性。事实上，正是中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国一贯主张一切外国武装力量同时撤出朝鲜。在我们讨论和平解决朝鲜问题的今天，大韩民国和美国仍不愿意将美国军队同其他一切外国军队同时撤出朝鲜，这不是正足以证明它们是在企图将美国军队继续留在朝鲜来干涉朝鲜内政并威胁朝鲜的和平和中国的安全么？但是，美国代表和大韩民国代表的主张显然是违反有自己的子弟在朝鲜的各国人民的愿望的。五月七日新西兰的代表说，他确信出席此次会议的国家都期待着他们的军队将从朝鲜撤出的日子。澳大利亚的代表在四月二十九日表示希望在满意的协议和强有力的约束的基础上，可能在某个较早的日期开始撤退军队。联合王国的代表在五月十三日也说：“我们有一个共同的希望，一当我们能够撤出军队而不再危及和平时，就从朝鲜撤出我们的军队。”可见从朝鲜撤出外国武装力量的愿望，就是在联合国军有关方面也是存在的。
    有人说，一切外国武装力量撤出朝鲜将影响朝鲜的和平。这种说法是没有根据的。为了防止朝鲜战争的再起，南日外务相建议由最关心远东和平的国家承担保证朝鲜和平发展的义务，以促成统一朝鲜国家的任务的实现。因此，我们认为本会议没有理由不能对从朝鲜定期撤出一切外国武装力量和由最关心远东和平的国家保证朝鲜和平发展的问题达成适当的协议。
    日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论已经经过了一个多月，爱好和平的各国人民都在希望我们的会议能够获得积极的结果。我们应该在已有的共同基础上，努力达成和平解决朝鲜问题的协议。我们不应该辜负各国人民的希望。
