    Petroleum Administration Bureau Convenes Refinery Research Work Conference
    [This newspaper] The Petroleum Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry convened a refinery research work conference from May 24th to 29th. Representatives from petroleum plants across the country, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tianjin University, Beijing Petroleum Institute, and other units participated in the conference. At this conference, experiences in scientific research work were exchanged, and the research projects, division of labor, and systems for future work were determined. At the same time, a clear direction was established that scientific research work must serve production.
    In the past, research work in petroleum plants played a certain role in the petroleum industry. First, it created preconditions for the restoration work of some factories. For example, Petroleum Plant No. 3 and Petroleum Plant No. 6 conducted research before restoration, found some production conditions, and selected appropriate catalysts, laying the foundation for production. Second, it improved production capacity. For example, the successful small-block furnace experiment at Petroleum Plant No. 1 increased shale utilization by 60 percent, saving the country 15 billion yuan annually, not only creating wealth but also solving the difficulty of insufficient shale supply. Third, it improved product quality. For example, improving the quality of transformer oil increased sales.
    The research work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and various universities and colleges has also been of great help to the petroleum industry. For example, the Dalian Institute of Industrial Chemistry's research on manufacturing lubricating oil from Yumen crude oil determined the production process and operating conditions for the lubricating oil workshop of Petroleum Plant No. 7. Research on the formulation of special lubricating greases enabled the petroleum industry to produce some urgently needed new products. Research on medium-pressure synthesis has opened up a new path for coal-to-oil conversion. Furthermore, the research on hard carbon black by the Changchun Institute of Science has enabled Petroleum Plant No. 4 to produce hard carbon black this year, meeting part of the country's needs.
    During the meeting, Yan Shuang and Xu Jinqiang, deputy directors of the Petroleum Administration Bureau, gave reports. Soviet expert Popov of the Beijing Petroleum Institute made a special trip to the meeting to introduce the situation of scientific research work in the Soviet Union. These reports and introductions will greatly help the development of future refinery research work.
    At the conclusion of the meeting, Li Fanyi, Vice Minister of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, gave a summary report, pointing out the important position that scientific research work occupies in the petroleum industry, determining the research projects and division of labor for future work, and finally putting forward three requirements: First, strengthen the organization and leadership of scientific research work; second, scientific research work should be closely integrated with production; and third, strengthen cooperation and coordination between factories, and between factories and scientific departments, to ensure that the petroleum industry completes and overfulfills this year's production plan, and creates favorable conditions for completing the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    石油管理总局召开炼油研究工作会议
    【本报讯】中央燃料工业部石油管理总局从五月二十四日到二十九日召开了炼油研究工作会议，参加这次会议的有全国各石油厂、中国科学院、天津大学、北京石油学院等单位的代表。在这次会议上交流了科学研究工作的经验，确定了今后研究工作的项目、分工和制度，同时还树立了科学研究工作必须为生产服务的明确方向。
    过去，石油各厂的研究工作对石油工业曾起了一定的作用：首先，为某些工厂的恢复工作创造了先决条件，如石油三厂、石油六厂在恢复之前曾进行了研究工作，找到了一些生产上的条件，选择了适当的触媒，给生产打下了基础；其次，提高了生产能力，如石油一厂小块炉的试验成功，增加页岩利用率百分之六十，每年可为国家节省一五○亿元，不仅创造了财富，而且解决了页岩供应不足的困难；第三，改进了产品质量，如变压器油改进质量后增加了销路。
    中国科学院和各高等学校的研究工作对石油工业也有着很大的帮助，如大连工业化学研究所对用玉门原油制造润滑油的研究，为石油七厂的润滑油车间确定了生产流程和操作条件；特种润滑脂的配制研究，使石油工业能生产一些迫切需要的新产品；中压合成的研究，给煤炼油开辟了一条新的道路。又如长春科学研究所对硬质炭黑的研究，使石油四厂今年能够生产硬质炭黑，解决了国家的部分需要。
    会议期间，石油管理总局副局长严爽、徐今强作了报告，北京石油学院苏联专家波波夫特地到会介绍了苏联科学研究工作的情况。这些报告和介绍，对今后炼油研究工作的开展，都将有很大的帮助。
    会议结束时，中央燃料工业部副部长李范一作了总结报告，指出了科学研究工作在石油工业中所占的重要地位，确定了今后研究工作的项目和分工，最后并提出三项要求：一、加强对科学研究工作的组织与领导；二、科学研究工作应密切结合生产；三、加强厂与厂、厂与科学部门之间的协作配合，以保证石油工业完成与超额完成今年的生产计划，并为提前完成第一个五年计划创造有利条件。
