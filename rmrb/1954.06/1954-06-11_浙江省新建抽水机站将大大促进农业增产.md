The first batch of ten pumping stations in Zhejiang Province, experimentally set up in Changxing, Jiaxing, Jinhua, Quzhou, Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo and other places, started preparation in December last year. By the end of April this year, the basic civil engineering and machinery installation projects had been basically completed, and they have been successively starting to irrigate farmers according to the local production seasons. After the completion and operation of these projects, they will be able to protect more than 85,000 mu of farmland from the threat of drought.

In the irrigation areas of various pumping stations, the threat of drought can generally be guaranteed in normal years after using the pumping stations, and more labor can be transferred to increase the accumulation of natural fertilizer, improve farming methods, improve agricultural technology and land processing, thus greatly increasing farmers' confidence in striving for large-scale increases in crop production. The Feng Xingsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Taizhou station's irrigation area originally planned to increase production by 15%, but was not very confident. After the station was built, it automatically revised the plan to 20%. Thanks to the guaranteed water supply, spring plowing was started six days earlier than in previous years throughout the irrigation area, saving more than 7,000 labor days. 69% of the farmland in the irrigation area will be converted from single-season rice to double-season rice, which is estimated to increase grain production by 240,000 jin. Li Qingzhi, a farmer in the Jiangjia Village irrigation area of Jiashan Station, had never grown rice before due to lack of water. After the establishment of the pumping station, he planted rice for the first time. The whole irrigation area of Hangxian Station will convert more than 1,000 mu of intermediate rice to late japonica rice, which is estimated to increase grain production by 150,000 jin. In the irrigation area of Jinhua Station, 2,300 mu of dry land have been converted into paddy fields, which can increase grain production by more than double.

    浙江省新建抽水机站将大大促进农业增产
    浙江省第一批在长兴、嘉兴、金华、衢州、温州、台州、宁波等地试办的十个抽水机站，从去年十二月开始筹备，今年四月底已基本完成各项土木基本建设工程及机器安装工程，并按各地生产季节陆续开始为农民灌水。这些工程完成与运用起来以后，将能保障八万五千多亩农田免除旱灾威胁。
    各抽水机站灌溉地区，在使用抽水机后一般年份都可保障不再受旱灾威胁，并可以调剂较多的劳力用于增积自然肥料、改进耕作方法、改进农业技术和土地加工，因而大大地提高了农民争取农作物大面积增产的信心。台州站灌溉区冯行生农业生产合作社原订计划增产一成半还信心不高，建站后自动修改为二成。由于用水有保证，今年全灌溉区比往年提前六天春耕，节省了七千多个劳动力；灌溉区百分之六十九的农田将单季稻改成双季稻，估计可增产粮食二十四万斤。嘉善站江家村灌溉区农民李庆芝因为缺水，从来没有种过水稻，抽水机站建立以后，他第一次种上了水稻。杭县站全灌溉区将一千多亩中稻改种晚粳稻，估计可增产粮食十五万斤。金华站灌溉区有二千三百亩旱地改成水田，可增产粮食一倍以上。
