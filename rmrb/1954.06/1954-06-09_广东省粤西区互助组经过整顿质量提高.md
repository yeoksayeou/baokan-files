    The mutual aid teams in the western Guangdong region of Guangdong Province have significantly improved in quality after rectification.
    Before the spring plowing, the western Guangdong administrative region had developed more than 12,600 permanent mutual aid teams and more than 94,300 temporary mutual aid teams. In late March, the CCP Western Guangdong District Committee convened a meeting of county party secretaries, deciding to shift the focus of leadership in the mutual aid and cooperation movement from development to consolidation. The counties also convened cadre meetings to implement this resolution. By mid-May, after the rectification of mutual aid teams throughout the region, the number of permanent mutual aid teams had increased from more than 12,600 to more than 14,000, an increase of more than 1,400. A number of temporary mutual aid teams have been converted into permanent mutual aid teams, and more than 12,700 have been added. The quality of the mutual aid teams has also improved. According to a survey of four districts in Dianbai County, after the rectification, the poorer-quality mutual aid teams—those lacking backbone members, those in which the problem of mutual benefit had not been well resolved, and even those that had been infiltrated by impure elements such as rich peasants—had been reduced from 50 percent of the total to 11 percent. More rural party members, Youth League members, and cadres have also joined the mutual aid teams. According to statistics from Enping County, among the party members in the countryside, the proportion participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations increased from 62.5 percent before the spring plowing to 88.6 percent now; the proportion of Youth League members participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations increased from 43.41 percent before the spring plowing to 73.75 percent now. According to statistics from Xuwen County, more than 90 percent of the main cadres in each township have joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations. After rectification, these mutual aid teams, under the influence and leadership of agricultural production cooperatives, have greatly promoted the production movement. Spring plowing in the counties was generally completed five or six days earlier than in previous years. The amount of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation generally increased compared to last year; the fertilizer accumulated by the mutual aid teams generally increased by one to two times compared to last year. Production technology has also been greatly improved. In Danbu Township, Dianbai County, promoted by mutual aid and cooperative organizations, 214 mu of single-cropping rice fields were converted to double-cropping this year, and 881.5 mu were converted from broadcasting to transplanting. In five districts of Enping County, 369 peasant households solved the difficulties of lacking cattle and labor due to being organized, and thus completed the spring plowing work in a timely manner.

    广东省粤西区互助组经过整顿质量提高
    广东省粤西行政区的互助组，经过整顿，质量有了显著提高。
    粤西区在春耕前，常年互助组已经发展到一万二千六百多个，临时互助组发展到九万四千三百多个。三月下旬，中共粤西区委员会召开了县委书记会议，决定把领导互助合作运动的重点，从发展转到巩固方面来。各县也召开了干部会议，把这个决议贯彻下去。到五月中旬止，全区互助组经过整顿后，常年互助组从一万二千六百多个发展到一万四千多个，增加了一千四百多个。临时互助组已有一批转为常年互助组，还增加了一万二千七百多个。互助组的质量也有了提高。据电白县四个区的调查，经过整顿后，质量较差的互助组即缺乏骨干，互利问题还没有很好解决，甚至被富农等不纯分子混进去的互助组，已由原占总数的百分之五十减到百分之十一。乡村党员、团员、干部参加互助组的也更多了。据恩平县的统计，在农村的党员中，春耕前参加互助合作组织的占百分之六十二点五，现在已增加到百分之八十八点六；春耕前团员参加互助合作组织的占百分之四十三点四一，现在已增加到百分之七十三点七五。据徐闻县的统计，各乡的主要干部已有百分之九十以上参加了互助合作组织。这些互助组经过整顿后，在农业生产合作社的影响和带领下，对生产运动起了很大的推动作用。各县的春耕一般比往年提早了五、六天完成。修水利、积肥料的数量普遍比去年有了增加；互助组积的肥，一般比去年增加一两倍。生产技术也有了很大的改进。电白县单步乡在互助合作组织的推动下，今年单造改双造的有二百一十四亩，撒种改插秧的有八百八十一亩半。恩平县五个区有三百六十九户农民由于组织起来，因而解决了耕牛和劳动力缺乏的困难，及时做好了春耕工作。
