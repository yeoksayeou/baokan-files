    People in the Old Revolutionary Base Area on the Sichuan-Shaanxi Border Cheer the Promulgation of the Draft Constitution
    Elderly Workers at Anyuan Coal Mine Discuss Their Thoughts on the Draft Constitution
    When newspapers carrying the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China were delivered to the counties in the old revolutionary base area on the Sichuan-Shaanxi border in Sichuan Province, people were overjoyed. In the county seat of Yilong County, the post office entrance was already crowded with people waiting to read the newspaper. On that day, all the street blackboards carried the news of the promulgation of the Draft Constitution. In the evening, wired broadcast loudspeakers continuously spread the good news to all the residents of the city. Veteran Red Army soldiers, cadres of the Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government, and families of Red Army martyrs, who had experienced the Second Revolutionary Civil War, gathered together to discuss the content of the Draft Constitution. Wang Sanfu, who had worked in the Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government at that time, burst into tears after reading the Draft Constitution. He said: What is said in the Draft Constitution is exactly what we have been thinking about for more than twenty years. We don't know how much blood we shed for it. We must protect this fruit well. Xie Xingyu, who was the chairman of the village Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, whose father had worked in the township Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government, and whose younger brother had been the captain of the guerrilla team, said: Our family participated in the revolution back then to survive, for freedom, and for democracy. Now, the Draft Constitution has written down the aspirations we fought for back then and have already realized since liberation. I wholeheartedly support it.
    The people of Bazhong County, the center of the old revolutionary base area, felt even more delighted about the promulgation of the Draft Constitution. When the news arrived, the Chengguan District was holding the first session of the first People's Congress. More than seventy representatives cheered unanimously, expressing their support for the provisions of the Draft Constitution. Workers from the twenty-four grassroots trade unions in Chengguan District decided to celebrate the promulgation of the Draft Constitution with practical actions to increase production.

    The elderly workers who participated in the famous Anyuan Coal Mine Strike in Pingxiang, a significant event in the history of China's workers' movement, were extremely excited about the promulgation of the Draft Constitution. On the afternoon of the 18th, it was raining, and the old worker Deng Changfu, carrying an umbrella, notified everyone door-to-door with a smiling face to listen to the report on the Draft Constitution. This report meeting was held in the "Anyuan Railway and Mine Workers' Club," where the strike order had been issued in 1922. The next day, more than forty elderly workers held a discussion in this club. At the meeting, they recalled the scene of Comrade Liu Shaoqi leading them in the nationally renowned strike in 1922. The old workers felt that the words "Previously we were cattle and horses, now we want to be human beings," which were written on many triangular red flags at that time, had now been realized.
    The good news of the promulgation of the Draft Constitution made these old workers, who had endured much suffering, become active and young again. Zhang Zhulin, an old worker at the Anyuan Coal Mine who works at the Pingxiang Mining Bureau, took a copy of the "Ping Mine Worker" newspaper carrying the Draft Constitution and rushed to Anyuan Town, more than twenty miles away, to bring the good news to his wife. When it got dark, he lit an oil lamp and put on his reading glasses to read the newspaper. Because the words were too small and he couldn't see clearly, he found a young man to read the Draft Constitution to him. Zhang Zhulin was very excited after listening. This sixty-seven-year-old worker said that although he could retire according to regulations, he was willing to continue working for the construction of the socialist motherland. During the discussion, the old worker Deng Changfu pointed to the scars on his body, which were inflicted by the reactionaries with iron rulers when he was imprisoned after being arrested, and said with infinite emotion: Beating, starvation, imprisonment, and massacre, this was the "law" of the reactionaries in the past. He happily expressed that the era of the "club constitution" will never come again. (Xinhua News Agency)

    川陕边老根据地人民欢呼宪法草案的公布
    安源煤矿老年工人座谈对宪法草案的感想
    当刊载着中华人民共和国宪法草案的报纸送到了四川省川陕边革命老根据地各县时，人们都欢腾起来了。在仪陇县县城，邮局门口早就挤满了等着看报纸的人。当天，街上的黑板报都登载着宪法草案公布的消息。晚上，有线广播的喇叭不断地向全城居民传播着这个喜讯。经历过第二次国内革命战争的老红军、工农民主政府的干部和红军烈士家属们，欢聚一堂座谈宪法草案的内容。曾经在当时的工农民主政府工作过的汪三福，读了宪法草案后激动得流了泪。他说：宪法草案上说的，正是我们二十多年来所想的。为了它，我们不知流过多少血。我们一定要好好地保卫这个果实。第二次国内革命战争时期曾当过村工农民主政府主席的谢兴宇，他的父亲曾在乡工农民主政府里工作过，弟弟也曾当过游击队队长，他说：当年我们一家人都参加了革命，就是为了要活命，要自由，要民主。现在，宪法草案把我们当年要争取的和在解放后已经实现的愿望都写上了，我衷心拥护它。
    当年革命老根据地的中心——巴中县的人民，对宪法草案的公布更是感到无比欢欣。消息传来时，城关区正在召开第一届第一次人民代表大会会议，七十多名代表一致欢呼，表示拥护宪法草案的规定。城关区二十四个基层工会的工人们，都决定用提高生产的实际行动来庆祝宪法草案的公布。（新华社）

    曾经参加过我国职工运动史上著名的萍乡安源煤矿大罢工的老年工人们，为宪法草案的公布而感到无限的兴奋。十八日下午，正下着雨，老工人邓长富撑着一把伞，满脸笑容地挨户通知大家去听关于宪法草案的报告。这个报告会就是在一九二二年曾经在那里发出过罢工命令的“安源路矿工人俱乐部”里举行的。第二天，四十多位老年工人们又在这个俱乐部里举行了一个座谈会。会上，他们想起了一九二二年刘少奇同志领导他们举行全国闻名的罢工的情景。老工人们都觉得那时在许多三角红旗上写的“先前是牛马，现在要做人”这两句话，现在已经实现了。
    宪法草案公布的喜讯，使这些饱经风霜苦难的老工人们也变得活跃和年青起来。在萍乡矿务局工作的安源煤矿老工人张竹林，带着一张刊登宪法草案的“萍矿工人”报赶到二十多里远的安源镇，把喜讯带给他的妻子。天黑了，他点上油灯，带上老花眼镜看报，因为字太小，看不清，便找来一位青年人把宪法草案念给他听。张竹林听完以后非常兴奋。这位六十七岁的老工人表示：虽然按规定他可以退休，但他还愿意继续劳动，为了建设社会主义的祖国。老工人邓长富在座谈时无限感触地指着他被捕后在监狱时被反动派用铁尺在身上打出的伤痕说：挨打、挨饿、坐牢、被屠杀，这就是以前的反动派的“法”。他高兴地表示，那个“棍棒宪法”的时代是永远不会再来了。（新华社）
