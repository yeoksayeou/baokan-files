    "Green Devil" Plays with Fire
    Hu Sising
    On June 18th, the Latin American "banana and coffee" nation of Guatemala was suddenly subjected to armed invasion. The invaders, wielding American-made guns, supported by American money, and with American planes assisting them in bombing and strafing Guatemala. As soon as the executioners started their work in Guatemala, the bosses on Wall Street became jubilant. According to the Associated Press, they "enthusiastically hoped" to quickly overthrow the Guatemalan government; Dulles couldn't contain his inner joy and thought this was exactly what he had "long hoped for." Why were the American invaders so happy?
    As everyone knows, the American "United Fruit Company," known as the "Green Devil" by the people of Central America, owns 600,000 acres of farmland, 65 ships, and more than 1,500 miles of railways in Central American countries, and controls the radio communications, electricity, and tram systems there. This company has long extracted profits of about 70 to 100 million US dollars from there every year.
    The American monopoly capitalists originally thought they could continue to exploit and enslave in this way without incident. However, since the democratic government of Guatemala, in its land reform, confiscated a large amount of fallow land seized by the "United Fruit Company" and distributed it to the vast number of peasants, the "United Fruit Company" and its agents in the American government became flustered. Because the Guatemalan government's actions not only blocked these gentlemen's path to wealth and prosperity in Guatemala, but also, because the Guatemalan people refused to act according to the will of the American monopoly capitalists, it set an example for the people of all Latin American countries not to be oppressed by the United States. This was a very dangerous thing for the "United Fruit Company," which had a whole system of rule in Latin America. Therefore, the American capitalists prepared to use violence to deal with the democratic government of Guatemala.
    The reason why the American government so hurriedly incited the invasion of Guatemala is that officials holding important positions in the government and Congress in Washington are also major shareholders of the "United Fruit Company." First of all, US Secretary of State Dulles is a major shareholder of the "United Fruit Company." As everyone knows, before becoming Secretary of State, Dulles headed the "Sullivan & Cromwell" law firm, which served as legal counsel to the "International Railways of Central America," which the "United Fruit Company" controlled Guatemala's transportation system. At the same time, people noticed that during the Security Council's discussion of the armed invasion of Guatemala, someone believed that American officials were treating the Guatemalan issue from "private interests," a statement that aroused Lodge's fierce opposition. But when people check the resumes of Washington officials, they will find that this Lodge is also a member of the Boston financial group that controls the "United Fruit Company." In addition, people will also find that the current chairman of the "United Fruit Company," Coolidge, was once Secretary of the Treasury; one of the company's managers, Fox, is the governor of Massachusetts; and Assistant Secretary of State Cabot, Secretary of Commerce Weeks, Presidential Assistant Adams, and Presidential Administrative Assistant Cutler are all important members of the "United Fruit Company" and its financial group. Unveiling the "United Fruit Company's" green curtain not only makes people see the relationship between the American government and the "United Fruit Company" clearly, but also makes it possible to know who is the culprit behind this armed invasion of Guatemala.
    The 19th-century Latin American revolutionary poet José Martí had long seen that "the United States is like a ferocious eagle that wants to grab the flags of all Latin American countries in its giant claws!" But today, the heroic struggle of the Guatemalan army and people to resist the enemy has shown the world that the Guatemalan people are inviolable and they are determined to defend their nation's sacred flag and territory. The people of Latin America and the broad masses of people in all countries of the world support the heroic struggle of the Guatemalan people.

    “绿色魔鬼”玩起火来了
    胡思升
    六月十八日，拉丁美洲“香蕉和咖啡”的国家危地马拉突然遭到了武装侵略。侵略者拿着美国制造的枪炮，受着美国金钱的支持，还有美国飞机配合他们对危地马拉进行轰炸和扫射。刽子手刚刚在危地马拉动手，华尔街的老板们就兴高彩烈起来了，据合众社说：他们“热情地希望”很快推翻危地马拉政府；杜勒斯更是止不住内心的高兴，认为这正是他“早已希望的”。美国侵略者为什么这样高兴呢？
    大家知道，被中美洲人民称为“绿色魔鬼”的美国“联合果品公司”在中美洲各国拥有六十万英亩的耕地、六十五艘船只、一千五百多哩的铁路，并控制着那里的无线电通讯、电力和电车系统。这个公司长期以来就每年从那里榨取约有七千万美元到一亿美元的利润。
    美国的垄断资本家们本来以为是可以这样安然无事地剥削和奴役下去的。然而，自从危地马拉民主政府在土地改革中，没收了被“联合果品公司”所强占的大量休耕土地分配给广大的农民以后，“联合果品公司”和它在美国政府中的代理人就慌乱起来了。因为危地马拉政府的行动不仅堵死了这些老爷们在危地马拉发财致富的一条路，而且由于危地马拉人民拒绝按照美国垄断资本家的意志来办事，就给所有的拉丁美洲国家的人民树立了一个不受美国压迫的榜样，这对在拉丁美洲有着整套统治系统的“联合果品公司”说来是一件非常危险的事情。于是，美国资本家就准备用暴力来对付危地马拉民主政府了。
    美国政府所以这样急急忙忙煽动对危地马拉的侵略，是因为在华盛顿担任政府和国会要职的官员同时也是“联合果品公司”的大股东。首先，美国国务卿杜勒斯就是“联合果品公司”的一个重要股东。大家也知道，杜勒斯在做国务卿以前曾主持过“苏利文克朗韦尔”法律事务所，而这个法律事务所就是为“联合果品公司”控制危地马拉运输系统的“中美国际铁路公司”服务的法律顾问。同时，人们注意到了在安全理事会讨论危地马拉遭到武装侵略的问题时，有人认为美国官员对待危地马拉问题是从“私人利益”出发，这种说法引起洛奇气势汹汹的反对。但是人们一查华盛顿官员们的履历表，就会发现这个洛奇也是控制“联合果品公司”的波士顿金融集团的一分子。此外，人们还会发现“联合果品公司”现任董事长柯立奇曾当过财政部长；这个公司的一位经理福克斯是马塞诸塞州州长；而助理国务卿卡伯特、商务部长威克斯、总统助理亚当斯和总统行政助理卡特勒都是“联合果品公司”和它的金融集团的重要成员。揭开了“联合果品公司”的绿色帷幕，不仅使人看清楚了美国政府和“联合果品公司”是什么关系，也可以知道发动这次对危地马拉的武装侵略的罪魁是什么人了。
    十九世纪拉丁美洲的革命诗人何塞·马蒂早就看到了“美国像是一只凶恶的鹰，它想把拉丁美洲各国的国旗都抓在它的巨爪里！”但是今天危地马拉军队和人民奋起抗敌的英勇斗争已经向全世界表明了：危地马拉人民是不可侮的，他们决心保卫他们国家神圣的国旗和国土。拉丁美洲人民和世界各国广大人民都支持危地马拉人民的英勇斗争。
