Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 2nd. The delegations of the nine countries participating in the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina held a restricted meeting on the 2nd. The following communique was issued:

"At the restricted meeting on June 2nd, the delegations of the nine countries continued to discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. The next restricted meeting will be held on June 3rd."

Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd. Tass, Geneva, June 3rd: It is reported that the delegations of the nine countries held a meeting on the 2nd to discuss the supervision of the implementation of the agreement on the cessation of military operations in Indochina.

In this regard, political observers here point out that the participants in the meeting agreed in principle that the task of supervision should be carried out by mixed commissions composed of both sides and neutral nations commissions. It is known that on the issue of the composition of the neutral nations commission, the Soviet delegation pointed out that two European countries and two Asian countries could be possible members of this commission, namely: Poland, Czechoslovakia, India, and Pakistan. It is reported that the Soviet delegation's proposal was supported by the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China. It is also understood that so far, the representatives of other countries have not put forward any other proposals regarding the composition of the neutral nations commission. These delegations have only expressed opposition and opinions on the principles and substance of the Soviet delegation's proposal.

The US delegation said: "Communist countries cannot be neutral" and therefore cannot be members of the neutral nations commission. It is pointed out here that the US delegation's position of not allowing non-capitalist countries to be members of the neutral nations commission is obviously due to its unwillingness to reach an agreement and its attempt to obstruct the adoption of a mutually agreeable resolution on the issue under discussion. It is reported that the Soviet delegation pointed out that attention must be paid to the criticisms made at the meeting regarding the working experience of the neutral nations commission responsible for supervising the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. However, regardless of any opinions on the work of the neutral nations commission in Korea, the principled attitude towards the establishment of a neutral nations commission in Indochina cannot be different from the attitude towards the neutral nations commission in Korea.

It is also learned that at the meeting on the 2nd, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in clarifying its position on the supervision of the implementation of the agreement on the cessation of military operations, emphasized that it believed that the main aspects of supervision should be: the implementation of the plan for demarcating areas and regrouping regular forces, and the prohibition of the entry of troops and various military equipment into Indochina from outside.

According to the proposal of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, two supervisory bodies should be established:

First, a mixed body, mainly responsible for supervising the strict implementation of the plan for demarcating areas and regrouping troops; the establishment of this body requires sincere cooperation between the commands of both sides.

Second, an international body composed of representatives of neutral countries, whose task is to supervise the implementation of the resolution prohibiting the entry of new troops and various military equipment into Indochina from the outside, in close contact with the former body. Only an absolutely impartial body can be competent for this task.

According to the opinion of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the mixed supervisory commission should be responsible for the implementation of the agreement on the cessation of military operations. The mixed supervisory commission is actually the armistice commission, and the representatives of the general headquarters of both sides are members of the commission. Only this commission can be responsible for fulfilling this task and this responsibility. Consideration should be given to the situation in which one party violates the agreement. In this case, the mixed supervisory commission, as a mediator for this party, puts forward appropriate suggestions to it, requiring it to implement the agreement more strictly.

It can be seen from this that, according to the opinion of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the mixed supervisory commission has the primary task of strictly implementing the agreement on the cessation of military operations. This task is borne by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, one of the two main parties concerned in this issue, and the French side. Regarding the neutral nations supervisory commission, considering its nature and composition, its main task is to prohibit the entry of new troops and military equipment into Indochina from outside. Once one party violates the agreement on prohibiting the entry of new troops and military equipment into Indochina from outside, the neutral nations supervisory commission shall notify the mixed supervisory commission, and then the mixed supervisory commission shall be responsible for notifying the parties concerned to ensure stricter compliance with the agreement. Neutral nations supervision should be implemented in all three countries of Indochina, especially the supervision of the prohibition of the entry of troops and military equipment into Indochina from outside.

According to the position clarified by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the neutral nations commission and the mixed commission should cooperate closely, and this cooperation does not imply that one commission is dependent on or subordinate to the other.

    越南民主共和国代表团在二日限制性会议上
    阐明关于监督停战问题的立场
    【新华社日内瓦二日电】参加日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平问题讨论的九个国家的代表团二日举行限制性会议后发表公报如下：
    “在六月二日的限制性会议中，九国代表团继续讨论恢复印度支那和平的问题。下一次限制性会议将在六月三日举行。”
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社日内瓦三日讯：据悉，九国代表团二日举行会议，讨论了关于对印度支那停止军事行动协定的履行进行监督问题。
    在这方面，此间政治观察家指出，会议的参加者原则上同意由双方组成的混合委员会和中立国委员会执行此项监督任务。大家知道，在中立国委员会的成员问题上，苏联代表团曾指出两个欧洲国家和两个亚洲国家作为这一委员会的可能成员，即：波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、印度、巴基斯坦。据悉，苏联代表团的建议得到越南民主共和国代表团和中华人民共和国代表团的支持。又悉，迄今为止，其他国家的代表没有提出其他任何关于中立国委员会成员的建议。这些代表团对于苏联代表团的建议的原则和实质，只是一味表示反对和提出意见。
    美国代表团说：“共产主义国家不可能是中立的”，因此不能作为中立国委员会的成员。此间指出，美国代表团采取不允许非资本主义国家作为中立国委员会的成员这种立场，显然是由于它不愿意达成协议，企图阻挠就所讨论的问题作出大家都同意的决议。据悉，苏联代表团指出，必须注意在会议上对于负责监督朝鲜停战协定的履行的中立国委员会的工作经验所提出的批评。但是，无论对于在朝鲜的中立国委员会的工作提出什么意见，对待在印度支那成立中立国委员会这一问题的原则态度是不能和对待在朝鲜的中立国委员会的态度有所不同的。
    又悉，在二日的会议上，越南民主共和国代表团在阐明它对停止军事行动协定的履行进行监督这一问题的立场时着重指出，它认为，监督的方面主要应当是：履行关于划定地区和重新集结正规军的计划、禁止从外面把军队和各种军事装备运入印度支那。
    根据越南民主共和国代表团的建议，应该设立两个监督机构：
    一、混合机构，主要是负责监督严格履行划定地区和重新集结军队的计划；成立这个机构，需要双方司令部都有诚意进行密切合作。
    二、由中立国代表组成的国际机构，它的任务是：在和前一个机构密切联系下，对禁止从外面将新的部队和各种军事装备运入印度支那的决议的履行进行监督。只有绝对不偏不倚的机构才能胜任这个任务。
    根据越南民主共和国代表团的意见，对停止军事行动协定的履行负责任的应当是混合监督委员会。混合监督委员会实际上就是停战委员会，双方总司令部的代表是该委员会的成员，只有这一委员会才能负责履行这种任务和这种责任。应当考虑到某一方发生破坏协定的情况。在这种情况下，混合监督委员会作为对这一方的调处人，向它提出适当的建议，要求它更严格地履行协定。
    由此可见，根据越南民主共和国代表团的意见，混合监督委员会对于严格履行停止军事行动协定负有首要的任务。这一任务是由作为对这个问题的两个主要有关方面的越南民主共和国一方和法国一方负担。关于中立国监督委员会，考虑到它的性质和成员，它的主要任务是禁止从外面将新的军队和军事装备运入印度支那。一旦某一方破坏关于禁止从外面将新的军队和军事装备运入印度支那的协定，中立国监督委员会就要通知混合监督委员会，然后由混合监督委员会负责通知有关方面保证更严格地遵守协定。在印度支那三个国家中都应该实行中立国的监督，特别是对于禁止从外面将军队和军事装备运入印度支那的监督。
    按照越南民主共和国代表团所阐明了的立场，中立国委员会和混合委员会应该紧密合作，而这种合作并不含有一个委员会依赖和从属于另一委员会的意思。
