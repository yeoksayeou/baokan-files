Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 4th: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on June 3rd, and a letter from the Thai representative to the President of the Security Council on May 29th of this year was included in the preliminary agenda of the meeting. The letter mentioned a situation that seemed to be "threatening Thailand's security, and if it continues, it may endanger international peace and international security." Although the letter did not mention Indochina, it is clear that it refers to the situation in Indochina.

The Soviet representative, Mr. Tsarapkin, spoke against including the issue raised by the Thai delegation on the Security Council's agenda. Tsarapkin said that the Geneva Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, the People's Republic of China, France, and the United Kingdom, the five permanent members of the Security Council, as well as other countries related to the Indochina issue, is currently reviewing the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. In view of this, there is no need for the Security Council to review the issue raised by Thailand. The Security Council's review of this issue will not only not help resolve the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, but will also hinder the smooth resolution of this issue by the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference. Everyone knows that this is precisely what certain aggressive blocs, especially the aggressive bloc of the United States, are trying to achieve in order to prepare conditions for expanding foreign intervention in the Indochina war.

The Soviet representative continued that it is impossible not to notice this strange coincidence: Thailand's appeal to the United Nations Security Council comes precisely when there are some encouraging factors in Geneva that allow for direct negotiations between the countries concerned. This coincidence is by no means accidental, because everyone knows that the aggressive blocs, especially the United States, have recently intensified their activities to undermine the Geneva Conference. Indeed, the appearance of "Thailand's appeal" in the Security Council cannot be explained by any other reason than this: the aggressive blocs are attempting to obstruct the Geneva Conference and hinder the negotiations taking place there aimed at finding a peaceful solution to the Indochina issue.

The Soviet representative finally emphasized that, in view of the above, the Soviet delegation will vote against including the issue raised by Thailand on the agenda of the Security Council meeting.

The French representative said that he "understands" the "concerns" expressed by the Soviet delegation, but he will support including Thailand's proposal on the agenda of the Security Council meeting.

The majority of the Security Council representatives voted in favor of the proposal to include the issue raised by the Thai delegation on the agenda.

The Soviet representative voted against this proposal.

In his speech, the Thai representative quoted words from American reactionary newspapers and wantonly slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He requested that the United Nations "Peace Observation Group" immediately dispatch a group of observers to observe and then submit a report to the Security Council.

Subsequently, the Lebanese representative suggested that the Security Council adjourn the meeting, and the next meeting should be convened depending on the progress of the Geneva Conference and the requests of the Security Council representatives. He said that the Security Council should not discuss the issue raised by the Thai delegation now.

Lebanon's proposal was adopted, and the Security Council meeting was adjourned.

    美国操纵联合国安理会把所谓“泰国的呼吁”列入初步议程
    苏联代表指出美国企图借此阻挠日内瓦会议
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社纽约四日讯：联合国安全理事会六月三日举行会议，泰国代表今年五月二十九日给安全理事会主席的一封信列入了会议的初步议程。信中提到一种情况，似乎这种情况“正威胁着泰国的安全，并且假如再继续下去，就可能危及国际和平与国际安全”。虽然信中并未提及印度支那，但是很明显，这里所讲的就是印度支那的形势。
    苏联代表查拉普金发言，反对把泰国代表团所提的问题列入安全理事会的议程。查拉普金说：苏联、美国、中华人民共和国、法国和英国，即安全理事会的五个常任理事国，以及其他和印度支那问题有关国家的外交部长的日内瓦会议现在正在审查恢复印度支那和平的问题。有鉴于此，安全理事会审查泰国所提出的问题就毫无必要。安全理事会审查这一问题，不只不会有助于恢复印度支那和平问题的解决，并且会妨碍日内瓦外长会议顺利地解决这一问题。大家知道，这正是某些侵略集团，特别是美国的侵略集团所努力想达到的，以便替扩大外国对印度支那战争的干涉准备条件。
    苏联代表继续说，不能不注意到这种奇怪的巧合：泰国向联合国安全理事会提出呼吁，正是在日内瓦出现了使有关国家进行直接谈判的某些令人兴奋的因素的时候。这种巧合绝非偶然，因为大家知道，侵略集团，首先是美国，最近特别加紧进行了破坏日内瓦会议的活动。的确，在安全理事会出现“泰国的呼吁”，是没有别的理由可以解释的，只有一个理由，这就是：侵略集团企图阻挠日内瓦会议，阻碍那里正在进行的旨在设法和平解决印度支那问题的谈判。
    苏联代表最后着重指出，鉴于上述情况，苏联代表团将投票反对把泰国代表提出的问题列入安全理事会会议的议程。
    法国代表说，他“了解”苏联代表团所表示的
  “担心”，但是他将赞成把泰国的建议列入安全理事会会议的议程。
    安全理事会大多数代表投票赞成关于把泰国代表团所提出的问题列入议程的建议。
    苏联代表投票反对这一建议。
    泰国代表在发言时引用美国反动报纸上的一些话，对越南民主共和国大肆诬蔑。他要求联合国
  “和平观察团”立即派遣一批观察员前往观察，然后向安全理事会提出报告。
    随后黎巴嫩代表建议安全理事会休会，下次会议的召开要看日内瓦会议的进展如何以及安全理事会代表的要求而定。他说，安全理事会现在不应讨论泰国代表团提出的问题。
    黎巴嫩的建议被通过，安全理事会会议至此休会。
