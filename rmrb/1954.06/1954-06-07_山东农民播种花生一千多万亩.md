Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, June 6th: Shandong Province has planted over ten million mu of peanuts, an increase of nearly two million mu compared to last year. Currently, in the Linqi, Jining, Tai'an and other regions, most of the peanut seedlings have emerged completely, with some already branching and forming mounds. Farmers are now weeding and protecting the seedlings. In some areas of the Wendeng region, the peanut seedlings are emerging unevenly due to low ground temperatures. Local people's governments are leading farmers to replant peanuts, and in some cases intercropping sesame and other crops. In addition, farmers in some areas are actively intercropping peanuts in wheat fields according to local customs, or planting peanuts in wheat stubble after the wheat harvest.

This spring, mutual aid and cooperative organizations in major peanut-producing areas such as Laiyang, Wendeng, Linqi, and Jiaozhou in Shandong Province actively responded to the people's government's call to increase oil crop production, and planted peanuts on mountain land with low grain production but suitable for peanut cultivation. Many counties such as Penglai and Yiyuan have exceeded their planned peanut planting area. In order to increase the yield per unit area of peanuts, farmers in various places mostly used rhizobium bacteria to treat the seeds during sowing. Agricultural technology promotion stations in counties such as Qixia and Zhaoyuan also sent technicians to the countryside to help farmers improve peanut planting techniques and prevent plant diseases and insect pests.

    山东农民播种花生一千多万亩
   【新华社济南六日电】山东省已播种花生一千多万亩，比去年扩大近二百万亩。目前临沂、济宁、泰安等专区的花生大部分出苗齐全，有的已分蘖盘墩，农民正进行锄草保苗。文登等专区部分地区的花生因地温低而出苗不齐，当地人民政府正领导农民补种花生，有的并间种芝麻等。此外，部分地区农民还按照当地习惯，积极在麦田内套种花生，或是待麦收后种麦茬花生。
    今年春天，山东省莱阳、文登、临沂、胶州等主要花生产区的互助合作组织积极响应人民政府增产油料作物的号召，纷纷把产粮很低而适宜种植花生的山岭地种上花生，蓬莱、沂源等许多县实种花生面积都已超过预定计划。为了提高花生的单位面积产量，各地农民在播种期间多使用根瘤菌拌种。栖霞、招远等县的农业技术推广站还派技术员下乡，帮助农民改进花生种植技术和预防病虫害。
