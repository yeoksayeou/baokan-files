Xinhua News Agency, June 25th—The first sessions of the first People's Congresses of all districts in Beijing, which began successively on the 16th, have all concluded by the 25th. More than two thousand people's representatives at the district meetings enthusiastically discussed the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and unanimously passed resolutions endorsing the Draft Constitution. The meetings also elected deputies to the Beijing Municipal People's Congress.

All district People's Congress meetings placed the discussion of the Draft Constitution as an important item on the agenda. Before the meetings began, the representatives carefully read the full text of the Draft Constitution. Zhang Youyu, Director of the Beijing Municipal Draft Constitution Discussion Committee, gave a report to the district people's representatives of the entire city (except the Jingxi Mining District) on the basic spirit and main content of the Draft Constitution. At the meetings, people's representatives from all walks of life and social strata, including workers, peasants, government cadres, cultural and educational workers, youth, women, industrialists and merchants, ethnic minorities, and religious circles, discussed the Draft Constitution enthusiastically with the attitude of masters of the country, expressing their determination to fulfill their duties, consolidate the people's democratic system, and ensure the implementation of the Constitution by leading the broad masses after its official promulgation. Hou Decheng, a Beijing Municipal Model Worker and shift foreman of the No. 2 Blast Furnace at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, said at the Shijingshan District People's Congress meeting: "The Draft Constitution clearly defines the general task of the state during the transition period. After reading the Draft Constitution, I feel even more keenly the importance of the working class's mission." Gao Zhaowen, a representative to the Qianmen District People's Congress and chairman of the grassroots trade union of the privately-owned Ruifuxiang Silk and Cloth Store, said when discussing the Draft Constitution: I want to implement the state's policy on capitalist industry and commerce in my actual work and assist the state in completing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Farmers' representatives from the suburbs expressed their heartfelt support for the Draft Constitution. Li Zonghe, director of the Baipenyao Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengtai District, said excitedly: "In the past, we didn't understand what a constitution was. When landlords and bailiffs ran out of money, asking you for money was the 'law,' and walking along the landlord's land was 'illegal.' Now that we have our own great law, our interests are even more guaranteed." Representatives of ethnic minorities in various districts felt very close to the Draft Constitution. People's Representative Wang Xizhong (Hui nationality) said with emotion: In the past, the Hui people had narrow paths, either selling cut cakes or green vegetables; now the Hui people have wider paths, and this is all the happiness brought to us by Chairman Mao's great ethnic policy. The district meetings finally unanimously passed resolutions endorsing the Draft Constitution. The resolution passed by the Shijingshan District People's Congress meeting stated: The fact that the Chinese people can formulate their own great law is the result of the heroic struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We are determined to unite all workers and peasants in the district to launch a technical innovation movement and an agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement to support the Draft Constitution with practical actions.

At the district meetings, deputies to the Municipal People's Congress were elected by secret ballot, and all candidates were elected with a large number of votes. The meetings also carefully reviewed and discussed the work reports and work plans of the district people's governments, and some also criticized shortcomings in the work. Xidan District and Xuanwu District also elected people's assessors at the meetings to participate in the trial work of the district people's courts on a rotation basis.

Xinhua News Agency, June 25th—The districts of Beijing have elected 554 deputies to the Municipal People's Congress at the first session of the first People's Congress. Another ten deputies are being elected by the troops stationed in Beijing.

The election of deputies to the Beijing Municipal People's Congress was conducted by secret ballot. Before the election, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China invited representatives of the Beijing organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations to repeatedly consult on the list of candidates for deputies. At the meetings of the People's Congresses of various districts, there was also a full discussion. The representatives expressed great satisfaction with this method of nominating candidates for deputies through consultations from top to bottom and discussions from bottom to top, believing that it fully promoted the spirit of democracy. As a result of the election, all the jointly proposed candidates for deputies were elected as deputies to the Municipal People's Congress with the most votes.

Among the 554 elected deputies are workers, peasants, heads of government agencies, people's organizations, and Beijing organizations of various democratic parties, as well as university professors, middle and primary school teachers, medical and health workers, engineers, literary and art workers, journalists, private industrialists and merchants, ethnic minorities, and representatives of various circles and strata in the religious community. Peng Zhen, secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Liu Ren, deputy secretary, and Zhang Youyu, vice mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, were all elected as deputies to the Municipal People's Congress. Other elected deputies include Liu Laifu, vice chairman of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions; Zhang Xiaomei, chairman of the Beijing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation; Wu Han, chairman of the Beijing Municipal Branch of the China Democratic League; Li Yong, a national railway model worker; Liu Shimei, a national textile industry model worker and female worker at the Beijing Qinghe Woolen Mill; Chen Hongzhi, a young advanced producer and female worker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant; Yin Weichen, a Beijing municipal agricultural model worker and director of the Huangtugang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative; Qian Weichang, provost of Tsinghua University; Xiang Da, professor of the Department of History at Peking University; Hua Luogeng, a famous Chinese mathematician; writer Shu Sheyu (Lao She); famous Peking opera actor Mei Lanfang; playwright Cao Yu; Xu Xiaobing, a film worker who won the Stalin Prize and the Second Class National Flag Medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; Li Kezuo, chief engineer of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory; Dai Nianci, engineer of the Design Institute of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering; Zhu Zhongli, vice president of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital; Le Songsheng, manager of Beijing Tongrentang; Yang Deliang, Imam of the Niujie Mosque in Beijing; and Jucan, deputy secretary-general of the Buddhist Association of China. Among the deputies, there are 106 women and 37 representatives of ethnic minorities.

The elected deputies to the Municipal People's Congress were invited to meet with the people and district people's representatives in various districts and received certificates of election issued by the Beijing Municipal Election Committee. When these representatives arrived at the venues of the district People's Congress meetings, the district people's representatives stood up and cheered, and the warm applause lasted for a long time, demonstrating their infinite trust and love for the representatives they had elected. Many municipal people's representatives spoke at the meetings, thanking the people for their trust and entrustment and promising to wholeheartedly complete the glorious tasks entrusted to them by the people. At the Dongdan District People's Congress meeting, Zhou Ren, the district head of the Dongdan District People's Government, speaking on behalf of all the elected Communist Party members, said: We are holding the enthusiasm of wholeheartedly serving the people and will devote all our energy to our work and strive to realize the country's general task during the transition period. In his speech, Zhou Ren also expressed his hope to be regularly supervised by the people. Peng Xingde, a national railway model worker, said at the Xisi District People's Congress meeting: "I deeply feel the great responsibility of being a people's representative. I will be a good servant of the people and live up to everyone's expectations." Wu Xue, director of the China Youth Art Theater, stated at the Dongdan District People's Congress meeting: We will definitely complete the tasks entrusted to us by everyone, and at the same time do a good job in artistic work and create more spiritual food for the people. The representatives' speeches were warmly welcomed.
