Shanghai, June 1st (report from our newspaper) The city of Shanghai held a representative conference of industrial labor models and advanced workers for the year 1953 on May 30th and 31st. Responding to the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to launch a technological innovation movement nationwide, and the suggestions of seven famous industrial labor models including Zhang Mingshan, the conference will further promote the technological innovation movement in Shanghai factories. More than 1,500 representatives of labor models, advanced production teams, and advanced workers from eleven industries including metal, textile, and light industry, such as Zhu Shunyu, Wu Meisheng, Yi Shijuan, Chen Weiqiu, and Ji Haoran, attended the conference. Representatives from Shanghai's Party, government, and people's organizations, agricultural labor models from Shanghai's suburbs, and combat heroes from the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, totaling more than 400 people, also participated in the conference.

Chen Pixian, Fourth Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Pan Hannian, Deputy Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, and Zhang Qi and Zhong Min, Vice Chairmen of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the meeting. They unanimously agreed that launching a technological innovation movement in Shanghai's factories was not only necessary but also possible. Many labor models and advanced worker representatives at the meeting enthusiastically expressed their willingness to actively participate in the technological innovation movement. Zhu Shunyu, a labor model in the metal industry, used his own experience of improving 24 tools and increasing work efficiency by one to eighteen times over the past two years, as well as his experience visiting the Anshan Iron and Steel technological innovation exhibition in Beijing, to illustrate the importance of carrying out the technological innovation movement. He expressed that he would better rely on the leadership of the Party, more humbly learn from advanced Soviet experience, better cooperate with technical personnel, and join the technological innovation movement with the vast number of workers, so as to more fully contribute his wisdom and talent to the country's socialist construction.

The conference received dozens of letters from workers and advanced production teams in factories, workshops, and work sections, expressing their support for and participation in the technological innovation movement. The conference adopted a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government and a telegram to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, expressing their determination to participate in the technological innovation movement. The conference also issued a letter to all workers in Shanghai, calling on everyone to actively participate in the technological innovation movement and strive to complete the 1954 national plan and the tasks of the First Five-Year Plan.

Chongqing, June 1st (report from our newspaper) Chongqing workers warmly support the decision of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to launch a technological innovation movement nationwide. The trade union of Chongqing Steel Plant 102 convened a forum on May 29th for labor models, advanced producers, and activists in technological innovation to discuss the decision of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the proposal submitted to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions by seven labor models including Zhang Mingshan. At the meeting, Tang Ruifu, Chongqing's special-class industrial labor model and steelmaking expert, said: Our steelmaking workshop suffers from poor production command and dispatching, and a lack of planning for maintenance, which increases non-production time and affects the monthly completion of production tasks. We must focus on these key issues, unite all employees, and launch a technological innovation movement to implement the decision of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions with practical actions. When discussing at the Huang Rongchang woodworking workshop of Chongqing Steel Plant 101, veteran worker Li Jian said: We must unite, learn from the spirit of Huang Rongchang's technological innovation, and continue to improve woodworking production. Engineer and labor model Zhou Chengzhu said: Our technical personnel must actively combine scientific and technological knowledge with labor experience, and deeply carry out the technological innovation movement focusing on key production issues.
