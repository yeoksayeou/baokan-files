Summer harvesting is proceeding intensely in most areas of Hainan Island. The summer harvest work in the earlier producing eastern coastal counties of Qiongdong, Lehui, Wanning, Ding'an, and the southern part of Wenchang County has basically ended, and summer cultivation and planting are underway. Due to the later production season, the summer harvest in the western coastal counties of Lingao, Danxian, and the five counties of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region will not begin until the end of the month. According to statistics from the eastern coastal counties that have completed the summer harvest, early rice production this year has generally increased by 10% to 25% compared to last year.

This year, most areas of Hainan are engaging in organized summer harvesting while simultaneously plowing and planting for the summer crop. Before the summer harvest, mutual aid teams in Wanning County arranged summer harvest and planting plans, inspected and replenished agricultural tools. Farmers throughout the county purchased more than 20,000 pieces of agricultural tools such as threshing racks and grain buckets before the summer harvest. Many mutual aid teams have achieved "harvesting and planting simultaneously." Most of the late-season arable land in the county has now been plowed, and farmers are repairing water conservancy facilities, accumulating fertilizer, and engaging in deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, striving for a bumper harvest of the late crop.

    海南岛东部各县早稻增产一成以上
    海南岛大部地区的夏收工作正紧张地进行。生产季节较早的东海岸琼东、乐会、万宁、定安四县及文昌县南部地区的夏收工作已基本结束，正在进行夏耕夏种。西海岸的临高、儋县及海南黎族苗族自治区的五个县，因生产季节较迟，月底以后才能夏收。根据已完成夏收的东海岸各县的统计，今年早稻一般比去年增产一成至二成半。
    今年海南大多数地区都是有组织地一面夏收，一面犁田夏种。万宁县各地的互助组，在夏收前就安排好了夏收夏种计划，检查和添补农具。全县农民在夏收前共购置了打谷架、谷桶等农具二万余件。许多互助组都做到“边收边种”。现在全县大部分晚造耕地已经犁翻，农民正在修补水利，堆肥积肥，深耕细作，争取晚造丰收。
