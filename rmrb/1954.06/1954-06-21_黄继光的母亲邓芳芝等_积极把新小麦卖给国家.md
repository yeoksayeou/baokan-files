    Huang Jiguang's Mother Deng Fangzhi and Others
    Actively Sell New Wheat to the State
    After Sichuan Province harvested its wheat, Deng Fangzhi, the mother of Huang Jiguang, a Special Class Hero and First Class Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and Wen Guizhen, the mother of Hu Xiudao, a First Class Hero and Special Class Hero, actively paid the summer grain tax and sold more than 980 jin of wheat to the state. After selling the wheat, Deng Fangzhi bought 200 jin of oil cake and deposited 200,000 yuan that was not immediately needed into the state bank.
    The patriotic behavior of the heroes' mothers inspired the local farmers' enthusiasm for selling surplus grain and paying the summer grain tax. In Jiguang Township, Fourth Village, Zhongjiang County, where Deng Fangzhi lives, all 137 households in the village have sold more than 11,000 jin of wheat to the state. The farmers in Jinyin Village, Jinlong Township, Jintang County, where Wen Guizhen lives, collectively sent their summer wheat to the state granary on May 24th and are now actively selling their surplus grain to the state.

    黄继光的母亲邓芳芝等
    积极把新小麦卖给国家
    四川省收割小麦以后，中国人民志愿军特级英雄、特等功臣黄继光烈士的母亲邓芳芝和一级英雄、特等功臣胡修道的母亲文贵珍，积极缴纳了夏征公粮，同时卖给国家九百八十多斤小麦。邓芳芝卖小麦以后，买了二百斤油枯，同时把暂时不用的二十万元存入了国家银行。
    英雄的母亲们的爱国行为，鼓舞了当地农民卖余粮和缴纳夏征公粮的热情。邓芳芝居住的中江县继光乡第四村，全村一百三十七户农民已卖给国家一万一千多斤小麦；文贵珍居住的金堂县金龙乡净因村的农民，已经在五月二十四日集体把夏征小麦送入国家粮库，现在正积极地把余粮卖给国家。　（吴之琛）
