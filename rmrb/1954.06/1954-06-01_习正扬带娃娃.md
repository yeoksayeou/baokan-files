Xi Zhengyang Takes Care of Children
By our reporter Liu Heng

Cared for Children Her Whole Life

Xi Zhengyang, a 76-year-old female member of the Zunsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Santai County, Sichuan Province, has cared for children her whole life.

Seventy years ago, when she was just a six-year-old child herself, she carried her one-year-old brother on her back, running around the courtyard. Then, she helped her mother raise four younger sisters. At nineteen, she married into the Yang family, where her sister-in-law was constantly having children, and she often had to help take care of her three nephews and nieces. Two years later, she herself started having children one after another, fourteen in total. Although only four sons and two daughters are still alive, all eight of her children suckled at her breast, ate from her hand, had their diapers soiled by her, and their cries and calls pained her heart.

In 1931, her eldest daughter-in-law gave her her first grandson. She kept saying, "This is a grandson, the first grandson! The eldest daughter-in-law doesn't know how to handle him, I should do it!" A few years later, her second daughter-in-law gave her her second grandson. She thought to herself, "This is also a grandson, I should take care of him. Otherwise, the second daughter-in-law will say her mother-in-law is biased!" Then came the third and fourth daughters-in-law, who gave her a total of twelve grandchildren in turn, each grandchild reaching out with small hands and arms for their grandmother to hold.

The year before last, she joined the mutual aid team. One day, a neighbor, Old Woman Dai Huazhen, came to her house to chat and they talked about taking care of children.

Dai Huazhen said, "I think you've had a good life, taking care of over twenty children!"

"More than thirty!" Xi Zhengyang quickly corrected her, and then laughed at the thought.

"You're so lucky, the youngest one is already so tall, four or five years old, isn't he? It's time for you to enjoy a few years of peace and quiet!"

"Yes, the little grandsons are all grown up—but it's strange, Auntie, I feel empty-handed and uncomfortable without a little one around!"

As she was speaking, her eldest son, Yang Bangyuan, returned from outside. He said that the mutual aid team wanted to set up a busy season nursery group and wanted his mother to join and take care of the children.

Xi Zhengyang waved her hands in a flurry, "No, no! Those are other people's precious darlings, how would I know how to take care of them?"

Yang Bangyuan said, "It's easy! Just take care of them like you take care of your own grandchildren."

Xi Zhengyang thought, "Take care of them like my own grandchildren," and nodded. Then she thought, "My son is the leader of the mutual aid team!" So she went to the mutual aid team's busy season nursery group to take care of the children. Last March, the mutual aid team turned into an agricultural production cooperative, and Xi Zhengyang transferred to the cooperative's busy season nursery group. This January, the cooperative expanded from twenty households to eighty households, and Xi Zhengyang went to the expanded cooperative's organized busy season nursery group to take care of children.

"Even better than I could take care of them myself!"

The children are taken care of separately by the old women. Xi Zhengyang takes care of two children.

These two children, one is Lai Xiuzhen's daughter, Jin Lanzi, and the other is Li Suqun's son, Huowazi. Both are their mother's first children, so they are very precious. However, no matter how precious the children are, they can't be held in their mouths all day long. During the busy farming season, both mothers have to go to the fields.

Last year, after Grain Rain, the work in the fields was one thing after another: cutting barley and pulling rapeseed, pulling rapeseed and cutting wheat. They also had to plant cotton in the barley fields, plant corn in the rapeseed fields, and plant rice in the wheat fields. All the men, women, old and young in the cooperative who could work in the fields went to the fields, harvesting, threshing, plowing, and planting, so busy that they had to split themselves into eight pieces.

Lai Xiuzhen handed Jin Lanzi over to Xi Zhengyang and went to the fields. Li Suqun thought, "There's a mountain between bellies, other people don't care about my child!" and carried Huowazi on her back to cut wheat. With every handful of wheat she cut, Huowazi's head would swing on her back. Cut two handfuls, and it would swing twice. Swinging back and forth, the child cried, the adult got tired, and less work got done. Later, Li Suqun left Huowazi in the house to thresh the grain. In the threshing ground, everyone was happy, talking and laughing. But she was anxious and flustered, often running home before she could rest or finish work. As a result, the child cried a lot. Later, Li Suqun also handed Huowazi over to Xi Zhengyang.

As soon as she handed him over, she was very worried and would sneak off to check on him.

The first time, Li Suqun saw Xi Zhengyang using a new towel (which her son-in-law's family had given her when she married her second daughter) to wash Huowazi's face. While washing him, she muttered, "Clean and tidy, good boy won't get sick."

The second time, Li Suqun saw Xi Zhengyang putting a piece of candy (which her eldest daughter had given her) into Huowazi's crying mouth. Huowazi's mouth was stuck together with the candy, he tilted his head and smiled.

The third time, Li Suqun saw Xi Zhengyang squatting by the ditch washing diapers (the children were already asleep at that time). Li Suqun felt bad and went over to say, "Old Woman Yang, leave it for us to wash after work, this is too dirty and smelly." Xi Zhengyang looked up and said, "Oh, how can you say that! You handle crops, grabbing manure and fertilizer with your hands, and you don't think it's dirty. A little child's poop isn't as smelly as an adult's!"

After seeing her a few times, Li Suqun stopped going to check on her. Not only did she stop going, but she also started spreading the word:

"Ah, she takes care of them even better than I could myself! I'm a hot-tempered person, and when the children are naughty, I get anxious and can't help but slap them. She doesn't say a harsh word or even think of touching them, no matter how much they cry!"

From then on, Li Suqun also happily went to the fields empty-handed like a man. She said, "Without anything to hold me back or worry about, I'm full of energy and strength."

"Pull one vine, the whole yard moves"

After the autumn harvest last year, Xi Zhengyang was elected as a labor model by the cooperative members. Before Grain Rain this year, she arrived at the nursery group early and was still taking care of Jin Lanzi and Huowazi. She had watched the two children grow up, and whenever she mentioned them, Xi Zhengyang would beam and talk endlessly:

"Everyone is different, even the ten fingers aren't the same. To take care of children, you have to figure out their temperament and go along with their nature.

"Jin Lanzi is a girl, gentle and quiet, doesn't like to move or run. If you give her a string of hyacinth bean beads, she can play with them for half a day. If you give her a small drum, she'll be content. Huowazi, he's like a little horse, running off in a flash. His feet haven't even taken root, he's always unsteady. If he runs far, you have to follow him quickly. You have to walk slowly behind him and call him gently, but don't chase him! If you chase him, he'll trip and fall.

"Jin Lanzi eats her meals sitting properly, one bite at a time. Huowazi eats his meals while running, taking a bite and running off. When he runs off, don't call him. If you call him, he'll hide from you. You pretend you don't see him, don't look at him. He swallows the food in his mouth and 'whoosh!' he runs back."

Xi Zhengyang also talked about how she coaxed them to wash their faces and hands, how she taught them not to wet their pants, and not to eat mud... She said, "Taking care of children is a delicate job, there are so many details involved!"

Everyone who has taken care of children knows that taking care of children is not only a delicate job, but also a troublesome and frustrating one! After the Zunsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative expanded this year, it expanded the nursery group in mid-April. At that time, several old women refused to participate. Huo Yinshi said, "I'd rather carry a thousand-pound gate than a lump of flesh! Taking care of children has hurt me." Jing Chengyu said, "Taking care of children has hurt me, if I don't have lice biting me, should I go and catch some to bite me?"

However, Old Cooperative Member Xi Zhengyang, what she said was different! She said, "Taking care of children hasn't hurt me, instead, it has smoothed out my temper!" She also told everyone some principles about taking care of children:

"Pull one vine, the whole yard moves, now we have established a cooperative! Having established a cooperative, it's not just your pain and my itch. If the crops grow well, everyone will get more grain. If the crops don't grow well, everyone is responsible.

"If you want the crops to grow well, men and women must work together. Men grab, women grab, you can start a family from scratch. If men work and women don't, the harvest will be half as much! If women want to go to the fields, the old women have to take care of the children. If you don't take care of them, and I don't take care of them, we'll have to have the older children take care of them—nowadays, older children have to carry backpacks and go to school!

"If the children are left for me to take care of, I will take care of them with all my heart. If I take care of them carelessly, the mothers won't feel at ease, and the children will suffer. If the children don't grow well, the fathers will feel sorry, the mothers will feel sorry, I, the old woman, will feel sorry, and all the cooperative members will feel sorry! In the past: 'If the crops turn yellow, the children will suffer.' Now, we old women want it to be: 'If the crops grow strong, the children will eat well!'"

By the end of April, four new old women had joined the nursery group.

    习正扬带娃娃
    本报记者  刘衡
    带了一辈子的娃娃
    四川省三台县尊胜农业生产合作社七十六岁的女社员习正扬，带了一辈子的娃娃。
    七十年前，当她自己还是一个六岁娃娃的时候，她就背了一个一岁多点的小娃娃，满院子乱跑。那个小娃娃是她的弟弟。跟着，她又帮助妈妈带大了四个妹妹。十九岁，她嫁到杨家来，正碰巧嫂嫂在一个挨一个地添娃娃，常要她帮忙带三个侄儿侄女。过了两年，她自己也开始一个挨一个地添娃娃了，前前后后一共添了十四个。虽说现在活着的只有四个儿子、两个女儿，可是，其他八个儿女全吸过她怀里的奶，吃过她手心的饭，尿布屎片都沾过她的手，啼哭喊叫什么的，都痛过她的心。
    一九三一年，大儿媳给她添了第一个孙子。她不住嘴地念：“这是孙子呀，头生孙子呀，大媳妇不晓得咋个弄，该我来！”不几年，二儿媳给她添了第二个孙子。她在心里想：“这也是孙子呀，该我来弄。要不，二媳妇说老婆婆偏心眼啦！”跟着是三儿媳、四儿媳，四个儿媳妇一轮一替地给她添了总共十二个孙儿孙女，个个孙孙都伸开小手小胳臂要婆婆抱。
    前年她参加了互助组。有一天，邻院老婆婆戴华珍来她家串门子，谈起了带娃娃的事。
    戴华珍说：“我看你这辈子也算过得去了，带过二十几个娃娃啦！”
    “三十多个啦！”习正扬赶忙纠正她，想想就笑了。
    “这是你福气大啊，老么都长这么高了，有四、五岁啦罢？该老婆婆享几年清静福啦！”
    “是哟，小孙孙都长大了——可也怪，他大婶，跟前没有个小人，我还空手空脚地怪难过！”
    正说着，她的大儿子杨榜元从外边回来了。他说，互助组要成立农忙托儿组，想让妈妈进去带娃娃。
    习正扬听了，急得手乱摆：“不成啰，不成啰！那是别人家的命根、宝贝蛋，我晓得咋个带？”
    杨榜元说：“好带好带！就像你带孙孙那样的带。”
    习正扬一想：“像带自个儿孙孙那样带”，就点头了。再想：“儿子是个互助组的组长啦！”就到互助组的农忙托儿组带娃娃了。去年三月，互助组转成农业生产合作社，习正扬就转到合作社的农忙托儿组带娃娃。今年一月，合作社从二十户扩大成八十户，习正扬就到这扩大了的合作社所组织的农忙托儿组带娃娃。
      “比我自个儿带得还好！”
    娃娃是由老婆婆们分开带的，习正扬带着两个娃娃。
    这两个娃娃，一个是赖秀珍的女儿金兰子，一个是李素群的儿子火娃子。两个都是他妈的头生娃娃，怪稀罕的。可是，娃娃再稀罕，也不能整天把他含在嘴里。农忙时节，两个妈妈都要下地。
    去年谷雨一过，地里的活路就一样赶一样：割了大麦扯菜籽，扯了菜籽割小麦。还要在大麦地里点棉花，菜籽地里种包谷，小麦田里栽水稻。全社男女老少能下地的都下地了，大家收哪，打哪，犁哪，种哪，忙得要把一身扯成八瓣了。
    赖秀珍把金兰子交给习正扬，就下地了。李素群想：“隔一层肚皮隔一重山，自己的娃娃别人不心疼！”就背着火娃子去割麦子。割一把麦子，火娃子的头就在背上甩一下。割两把，就甩两下。甩来甩去，娃娃甩哭了，大人甩累了，活也少干了。后来，李素群把火娃子丢在房子里去打场。场上，人家都欢欢喜喜，说说笑笑。她呢，心里又急又慌，常常不等歇气，不等收工，就跑回家去了。结果，娃娃哭坏了。再后来，李素群也把火娃子交给习正扬了。
    才一交去，很不放心，瞅个空子她就跑去看看。
    头一回，李素群看见习正扬拿一块新毛巾（那是她嫁二女儿时女婿家送给她的毛巾）给火娃子洗脸。一边手里洗，一边嘴里念：“干干净净，乖乖不生病。”
    第二回，李素群看见习正扬把一块糖（那是她大女儿送给她的糖）往火娃子正在哭着的嘴巴里填。火娃子的嘴巴被糖黏拢了，头一偏，笑了。
    第三回，李素群看见习正扬弯在堰沟旁边洗屎布（那时娃娃们已经睡了觉）。李素群不过意了，走过去说：“杨老太婆，留给我们下工回来洗吧，这个太脏太臭啦。”习正扬抬头就说：“哎哟，你还说这话！你们弄庄稼，一把一把地抓屎抓粪，都不嫌脏。小娃娃的巴巴，还没大人的臭！”
    看过几回，李素群不去看了。不光是不去看了，碰见人还宣传开了：
      “呀，比我自个儿带得还好！我是个焦性人，娃娃一淘气，我就呕得心慌，少不了要甩他一巴掌。她呀，不管娃娃咋吵咋闹，一句重话也不说，一指头儿也舍不得挅一下！”
    从此，李素群也高高兴兴地像男人一样的空身下地了。她说：“我没有绊脚绊手的，没有挂心挂肠的，就浑身添满了力气，添满了劲。”
      “牵一根藤藤满院子动”
    去年秋收后，习正扬被社员们选成劳动模范。今年谷雨没到，她早早就到了托儿组，带的还是金兰子、火娃子。两个娃娃是她看着长大的，一提起他们，习正扬就眉开眼笑，一说就是一大套：
      “百人百性，十个手指头就不一般齐。带娃娃，就要摸对他的脾气，顺着他的毛来。
    “金兰子是个姑娘，斯斯文文，不爱动，不爱跑。你给她穿一串葫豆珠子，她一玩就是半天。你给她一面小鼓，就把她哄住了。火娃子呀，跟个遛遛马样，一下就跑远了。他的脚还没生根，人是晃的。一跑远，你要赶快跟着。你在他后面，要慢慢地走，轻轻地叫，可不敢撵！一撵，他就绊倒了。
      “金兰子吃饭，坐得端端正正，一口是一口。火娃子呀，吃的是跑跑饭，咬上一口饭就跑了。他跑了，你不要叫，你一叫，他就跟你藏藏躲躲。你装作没有看见他的，不朝他望。他把嘴里的饭吞进肚子，‘嗖——’就跑过来了。”
    习正扬还讲她怎么样哄他们洗脸、洗手，怎么样教他们不尿裤子，不吃泥巴……她说：“带娃娃呀，那是个细活，里头板眼真多！”
    带过娃娃的，人人都知道：带娃娃不光是个细活，还是个麻烦活，呕气活！尊胜农业生产合作社今年扩社后，在四月中旬扩大托儿组。当时就有好几个老婆婆不肯参加。霍银氏说：“宁肯背千斤闸，不愿背一个肉疙瘩！我带娃娃带伤了。”敬成玉说：“我带娃娃带伤了，没有虱子咬，我还去捉个来咬？”
    可是，老社员习正扬呀，她说的话就不一样！她说：“我带娃娃倒没带伤，娃娃倒把我的脾气磨好啦！”她还向大家讲了一些带娃娃的道理：
      “牵一根藤藤满院子动，如今是成立了合作社呀！成立了合作社，就不是你痛你的，我痒我的。庄稼长得好，大家多分粮。庄稼长不好，人人有责任。
      “要庄稼长好，就要男女齐动手。男抓，女抓，白手能起家。男干女不干，收成少一半！妇女要下地，娃娃就归老婆婆带。你不带，我不带，只好叫大娃娃带——如今，大娃娃都要背书包、上学校哪！
      “娃娃叫我带，我就经心在意地带。我当三不当四地带，妈妈放不下心，娃娃也吃了亏。娃娃长不好，爹心疼，妈心疼，我老婆婆心疼，社员个个都心疼呀！往日：‘庄稼发了黄，娃娃遭了殃’。如今，我们老婆婆就要它：‘庄稼长得旺，娃娃吃的胖！’”
    到四月底，已经有四位老婆婆新参加托儿组了。
