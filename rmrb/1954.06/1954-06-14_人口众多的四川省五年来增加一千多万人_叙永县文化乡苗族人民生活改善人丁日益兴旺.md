Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, June 13th: Sichuan Province, the most populous in China, has experienced rapid population growth in recent years since liberation. The recent census confirms that the province's population has increased by more than 12.9 million compared to the figures from the Kuomintang Sichuan Provincial Statistics Office's 1948 survey. According to statistics from 139 cities and counties, over 7,888,000 infants have been born since liberation. In Pengshui, Xichong, and one other county, there are over 30,800 two-year-olds, over 37,000 one-year-olds, and over 46,500 infants under one year old.

The rapid population growth is attributed to several factors. Besides inaccuracies in past statistics, the primary reason is that the people have been freed from the reactionary rulers' bloody regime, leading to fundamental changes in their living conditions. In areas severely persecuted and massacred by the reactionaries in the past, displaced people have returned home, and barren lands have been reclaimed. In Chijiang Village, Qianfo Township, Tongjiang County, over 30 households returned and rebuilt their homes after liberation. The gradual improvement of people's living standards and the implementation of the new Marriage Law have enabled the working people to establish families. In 1953 alone, over 73,000 couples registered for marriage in 43 cities and counties, including Chengdu and Shehong. In Gaoxie Township, Hechuan County, out of the 180 couples married from 1950 to 1953, 136 were poor peasants who could not afford to marry before liberation. The improvement of medical and health conditions is also a significant factor in the rapid population growth. The province now has established over 870 medical institutions and over 2,300 maternal and child health institutions. Diseases such as smallpox and cholera, which seriously endangered people's lives before liberation, have now been significantly reduced, and in some places have essentially disappeared. The infant mortality rate has also greatly decreased. In Peng County, some women in the past gave birth to more than a dozen children without raising a single one. In 1953, among the over 15,100 infants born using the new midwifery methods in the county, only over 200 died.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, June 13th: The population census in Wenhua Township, Xuyong County, Sichuan Province, reflects changes in the lives of the Miao people. Wenhua Township is a mixed residential area for the Miao and Han people, with a permanent population of 2,855, of which 1,423 are Miao. Before liberation, the Miao people of Wenhua Township lived in the high mountains, with the vast majority living in hunger and cold. The Kuomintang reactionaries and Han landlords also continuously plundered and exploited them, creating ethnic discrimination and disputes. Many Miao people could not bear the oppression and fled to other places. Now, the Miao people have established a new life. The landlord class has been eliminated, and people of all ethnic groups have been allocated land and houses. More than 20 Miao people have become the main cadres in townships and villages. Farmers of both Miao and Han ethnicities in the township have also jointly organized 39 mutual aid teams. With their joint efforts, the township's rice production increased by nearly 10 percent last year, and corn production increased by more than 30 percent. In recent years, the Miao people have also received farm tools, winter clothing, relief funds, and relief grain from the People's Government, and their living standards have been improving day by day. The number of Miao children has been increasing year by year since liberation, with 24 four-year-olds, 43 three-year-olds, and 59 infants under one year old.

    人口众多的四川省五年来增加一千多万人
    叙永县文化乡苗族人民生活改善人丁日益兴旺
    【新华社成都十三日电】我国人口最多的四川省，解放后几年来人口迅速增加。从这次人口调查中证明：全省人口比伪四川省统计处一九四八年调查的数字增加了一千二百九十多万人。据一百三十九个市、县统计，解放后出生的幼儿有七百八十八万八千多人。彭水、西充等三县两岁的幼童有三万零八百多人，一岁的有三万七千多人，不满一岁的婴儿有四万六千五百多人。
  人口迅速增长的原因，除过去统计不精确外，主要是人民摆脱了反动派的血腥统治，生活状况发生了根本变化。在过去遭受反动派残酷迫害和屠杀的地方，流离失所的人已返回家园，荒芜的田地也重新开垦出来。通江县仟佛乡赤江村解放后返乡重建家业的有三十多户人家。人民生活的逐年改善，新婚姻法的贯彻执行，使劳动人民有了建立家庭的条件。一九五三年，仅成都、射洪等四十三个市、县登记结婚的就有七万三千多对男女。合川县高歇乡从一九五零年到一九五三年结婚的一百八十多对男女中，有一百三十六对是解放前无力结婚的贫苦农民。医疗卫生条件的改善，也是人口迅速增长的重要原因之一。全省现在建立了八百七十多个医疗机构和二千三百多个妇幼卫生机构，解放前严重危害人民生命的天花、霍乱等疾病，现在已显著减少，有的地方已基本绝迹。婴儿死亡率也大大降低。彭县过去有的妇女生十几个孩子，一个也没养活；一九五三年全县使用新法接生出生的一万五千一百多个婴儿中，死亡的只有二百多个。
    据新华社成都十三日电：四川省叙永县文化乡在人口调查中，反映出苗族人民的生活有了变化。文化乡是苗、汉两族人民的杂居区，常住人口有二千八百五十五人，其中苗族有一千四百二十三人。解放以前，文化乡的苗族人民居住在高山上，绝大多数过着饥寒交迫的生活。国民党反动派和汉族地主还不断对他们进行掠夺和压榨，制造民族间的歧视和纠纷。许多苗族人民不堪蹂躏，逃亡异乡。现在，苗族人民已建立起新的生活。地主阶级被消灭了，各族人民分得了田地和房屋。二十多个苗族苗民当了乡、村主要干部。全乡农、汉两族农民还联合组织了三十九个互助组。在他们共同努力下，去年全乡水稻增产将近一成，玉米增产三成以上。几年来，苗族人民还得到人民政府发给的农具、寒衣、救济款和救济粮，他们的生活日益改善。解放后苗族儿童逐年增加，四岁的幼童有二十四个，三岁的有四十三个，不满一周岁的婴儿有五十九个。
