    The Fall of the Laniel Cabinet
    By Our Correspondents Li Zhuang and Du Bo
    At the end of the seventh week of the Geneva Conference, the French Laniel Cabinet fell.
    The fall of the Laniel government marks the French people's declaration of the death penalty for the reactionary policy of the pro-war faction of the French government, which followed the United States in actively preparing to expand the Indochina War and passively coping with the Geneva Conference. This was the third "vote of confidence" in the French parliament in the month or so since the start of the Geneva Conference. Even before the vote, many bourgeois newspapers in France predicted that the Laniel government would inevitably fall. "Paris Radical News" wrote on the 11th: "Parliament has been weary of Laniel for several weeks... For a month and a half, the Geneva Conference has 'maintained' the government; the most weary people have hesitated to take on the responsibility at all costs, because it may hinder the chance of a ceasefire...". As in the past, Laniel used this psychology to once again play his two-faced trick. He finally threatened the parliament: "Those who demand a ceasefire are only indefinitely delaying the realization of a ceasefire if they cause the government to fall." Bidault's Popular Republican Party also threatened on the eve of the vote to obstruct the formation of a new cabinet, saying that the party would resolutely not participate in any cabinet that modified the current foreign policy. Nevertheless, the Laniel government survived the first two crises, but failed to survive this one.
    As everyone knows, the first "vote of confidence" after the start of the Geneva Conference was held on May 6. At that time, the French National Assembly wanted to hold a debate on the Indochina issue, but the Laniel government disagreed and therefore asked the parliament to cast a "vote of confidence." As a result, Laniel won with a majority of forty-nine votes.
    Originally, the French parliament's request to hold a debate on the Indochina issue largely reflected the French people's desire to stop the "dirty war" and restore peace in Indochina. Laniel skillfully used this sentiment at the time. Before the vote, Laniel delivered a speech to the parliament that was described by bourgeois news agencies as very "beautiful." He loudly appealed: "People have been asking us to have direct contact with Ho Chi Minh. Can the eve of negotiations with him be chosen as the time to overthrow the government?"
    Coordinating with Laniel's deception in Paris, Bidault was frantically spreading the atmosphere in Geneva that he had direct negotiations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the withdrawal of French wounded soldiers from Dien Bien Phu. According to news agencies, Bidault telephoned Paris from Geneva on May 6, saying that his negotiations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had been very successful and that "the Communist side is expected to agree." In this way, he gave some French parliamentarians the impression that: "The efforts made by the Foreign Minister in Geneva should not be hindered," so the Laniel government got dozens more "votes of confidence."
    But the actual situation was completely the opposite. Bidault did not have any contact with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at all at that time. According to a statement issued by the spokesperson of the Chinese delegation on May 7: On the afternoon of May 5, an official of the French delegation visited an official of the Chinese delegation to discuss the issue of the evacuation of the wounded and captured from Dien Bien Phu. The French official said that it was inconvenient for the French side to contact the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and asked the Chinese delegation to act as an intermediary. On the morning of May 6, the Chinese delegation replied to the French side, stating that since the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had arrived in Geneva, discussions on the Indochina issue could begin, and the issue of the evacuation of the wounded and captured from Dien Bien Phu proposed by France would be discussed at the meeting, and the two sides could contact each other. At that time, the relevant parties had agreed to hold a meeting on May 7 to discuss the Indochina issue, but on the evening of May 6, after the cabinet crisis barely passed, the French delegation's attitude towards actively seeking the evacuation of the wounded and sick prisoners suddenly disappeared, and the preliminary agreement to discuss the Indochina issue on May 7 was cancelled at the initiative of the French representative. In this way, the discussion on the Indochina issue was unreasonably delayed for a day.
    After Laniel-Bidault obtained the "trust" of the parliament by using two-faced tactics, they immediately became arrogant and proposed absurd "proposals" at the first plenary session on the Indochina issue on May 8, including "the withdrawal of Communist troops from Cambodia and Laos" and the disarmament of the non-regular forces of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. At that time, observers in Geneva unanimously pointed out that this "proposal" was tantamount to forcing the Indochina people to surrender. At this time, there was an uproar in France, and most parliamentarians believed that this was a manifestation of listening to the dictates of the United States and not actively striving to achieve a ceasefire.
    A week after this "vote of confidence," Laniel was forced again on May 13 to ask the parliament for a "vote of confidence" on postponing the debate on the Indochina issue. This time, Laniel only won a majority of two votes, forty-seven fewer than last time. Many Western bourgeois newspapers called this vote a "reprieve" for the Laniel government. Let's see how Laniel-Bidault obtained this "reprieve": Laniel threatened the French parliamentarians in Paris, saying that "whether the Geneva negotiations can continue depends on the attitude of the National Assembly"; Bidault, on the eve of the second vote, vigorously spread the atmosphere of peace from Geneva, and let his spokesperson hold a temporary press conference on the 11th to express that he could consider the proposal put forward by Vice Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong at the meeting on the 10th, although the spokesperson of the French delegation at the press conference held on the 10th had "resolutely" and "inconsiderately" rejected the proposal of Vice Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong.
    This French cabinet crisis began in late May when the French National Assembly decided to hold a third debate on the Indochina issue. As soon as Bidault heard that the parliament was going to debate the Indochina issue, he adopted the old trick again, trying to continue to cover up his policy of following the United States and internationalizing the Indochina War at the Geneva Conference, in order to seek another "reprieve" from the National Assembly for the Laniel government.
    On May 25, Bidault greeted Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai during the break of the meeting and said a few unimportant words; the news that appeared in the "France Evening News" and "Paris Radical News" in Paris the next day was "earnestly talked for several minutes," "the gradual change in diplomatic attitude is of great importance; an ordinary handshake is not a spontaneous expression." On May 28, Bidault shook hands with Vice Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong again, and on the 29th, "France Evening News" reported that "meetings in the corridor next to the meeting room are becoming more and more frequent... This is the best way to accelerate the relaxation in Asia." At the same time, Bidault began to travel between Geneva and Paris, reporting to the cabinet on the progress of the meeting to discuss the Indochina issue, and persuading the parliament not to hold a debate at this time, so as not to affect the negotiations in Geneva. According to "Le Monde" on May 27: The French cabinet meeting, based on Bidault's report, expressed considerable optimism about the future of the "ceasefire" agreement, and the ministers gave Bidault "full confidence"...
    Obviously, the restrictive nature of the meeting to discuss the Indochina issue to a certain extent facilitated the deceptive propaganda of the French authorities. By June 8, when the foreign ministers held the fifth plenary meeting to discuss the Indochina issue, Bidault hastily attributed the progress made at the meeting so far to his own account, and deliberately blurred the differences that existed at the meeting, as if the representatives of the participating countries had accepted his suggestions before the meeting could move forward. According to some Western journalists, the content of Bidault's speech was also what he was going to say in the National Assembly on the 10th, and his intention was very clear. However, the actual situation of the restrictive meeting to discuss the Indochina issue was completely different, but as Foreign Minister Molotov said: "Obviously, not all participants in the meeting have understood their responsibilities in the same way... Not all participants are concerned about restoring peace in Indochina as soon as possible." Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai also pointed out at the meeting on the 9th: "During the Geneva Conference, the pro-war faction in France is still keen on the United States' interference and expansion of aid to the Indochina War, and adopts a delaying policy towards the Geneva Conference."
    In addition, on the day before the National Assembly vote, a sensational rumor obtained by an American news agency from people close to Bidault was published in the Paris newspapers, saying that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had agreed to designate Hanoi, Haiphong, and Saigon as assembly points for the French expeditionary force, in order to deceive and mislead. It is said that when Bidault spoke to the parliament on the 10th, he also played another prepared card, which was to reveal that he had had two separate meetings with Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai in Geneva. According to a reporter from "France Evening News": Bidault wanted to use this to prove that he "has established a solid relationship with the delegations of communist countries," and the parliament's "accusations that he is insincerely seeking a basis for agreement in Geneva are unfounded." Indeed, although Bidault met with Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai twice, it is understood that what he expressed to Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai could not prove that he had any real sincerity for peace.
    No matter how many tricks he played and how many means he used, the Laniel government still could not avoid falling. This shows how unpopular the policy of obstructing peace in Indochina and pursuing the internationalization of the war implemented by French diplomats at the Geneva Conference was. If Laniel and Bidault thought that they had obtained a "reprieve" by using deceptive methods during the previous two cabinet crises, that was obviously also wrong. In fact, the last two times the French parliament voted a vote of confidence, the Laniel government was preserved with a limited and weak majority, because many people feared that the fall of the cabinet would hinder the negotiations to stop the Indochina War. This precisely shows the urgent desire of the majority of people in the National Assembly to stop this unpopular war in Indochina, which has exhausted France's people's wealth. In the third vote of confidence five weeks later, the parliament finally had to oust the Laniel-Bidault cabinet, which also showed that the National Assembly reflected the French people's firm will to end this "dirty war."
    Of course, the fall of the Laniel government this time is also directly related to the increasing number of people in the French parliament who oppose the ratification of the European Army Treaty. On June 9, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly passed the Moke report on rejecting the ratification of the European Army Treaty by a vote of twenty-four to eighteen, and on the same day, the Defense Committee of the French Federal Assembly passed the De Guorong report against the European Defense Group by a vote of fourteen to seven. These facts clearly prove that the Laniel government's war policy of following the United States is increasingly unpopular in the parliament, which cannot but further shake the foundation of his cabinet.
    With the fall of the French cabinet, the aggressive forces headed by US imperialism have stepped up their efforts to spread the atmosphere that the Geneva Conference is about to end in failure, but the forces of the French people, the Indochina people, and the peace-loving people of the world who demand the restoration of peace in Indochina are irresistible. What kind of new cabinet will be produced after the fall of the French cabinet is still unknown, but one thing is certain, that is: no matter what new cabinet, if it does not resolutely abandon the disastrous policy of following the United States and expanding the Indochina War followed by Laniel and Bidault, and sincerely seek a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue through consultation, it will also not be tolerated by the French people.

### 拉尼埃内阁的倒台

    拉尼埃内阁的倒台
    本报记者  李庄  杜波
    在日内瓦会议第七周的周末，法国的拉尼埃内阁倒台了。
    拉尼埃政府的倒台，标志着法国政府主战派追随美国积极准备扩大印度支那战争、消极应付日内瓦会议的反动政策被法国人民宣布了死刑。日内瓦会议开始后的一个多月以来，这是法国议会的第三次“信任”投票了。还在投票以前，法国许多资产阶级报纸就预言拉尼埃政府必然倒台。“巴黎急进新闻”在十一日写道：“议会对拉尼埃感到厌烦已有好几个星期了……一个半月来，日内瓦会议‘维持’着政府；最感到厌烦的人曾犹豫不敢担负起不顾一切的责任，因为它可能妨碍停火的机会……”。和过去一样，拉尼埃就利用这种心理，再一次玩弄其两面手法。他向议会最后威吓说：“那些要求停火的人假如使政府倒台，只是无限期地拖延了停火的实现”。皮杜尔的人民共和党也在投票前夕威胁着要阻挠新阁的组成，说该党将坚决不参加任何修改现行外交政策的内阁。尽管如此，拉尼埃政府混过了前两次危机，却未能混过这一次。
    大家知道，日内瓦会议开始后的第一次“信任”投票是在五月六日举行的。当时法国国民议会要进行印度支那问题的辩论，拉尼埃政府不同意，于是要求议会投“信任票”，结果拉尼埃以四十九票多数获得了“胜利”。
    本来法国议会之要求举行印度支那问题的辩论，在很大程度上是反映了法国人民要求停止“肮脏战争”、恢复印度支那和平的情绪。拉尼埃当时非常巧妙地利用了这种情绪。在投票以前，拉尼埃对议会发表了一个被资产阶级通讯社称之为十分“漂亮”的演说，他大声疾呼：“一直有人要求我们与胡志明进行直接接触。难道可以把与他谈判的前夕选来作为推翻政府的时机吗？”
    和拉尼埃在巴黎的欺骗相配合，皮杜尔这时在日内瓦拼命散布他已经和越南民主共和国就撤退奠边府法军伤员进行直接谈判的空气。据各通讯社透露，皮杜尔在五月六日从日内瓦给巴黎通过电话，说他和越南民主共和国谈判的成绩很好，“预料共方是会赞成的”。这样，他就给法国某些议员造成一种印象：“不应该妨害外交部长在日内瓦所作的努力”，拉尼埃政府因此才多弄到了几十张“信任票”。
    但实际情况与此是完全相反的。皮杜尔当时根本没有和越南民主共和国进行任何的接触。据中国代表团发言人五月七日发表的声明说：五月五日下午，法国代表团一官员访问中国代表团一官员，商谈奠边府伤俘撤运问题。法国官员说法方不便和越南民主共和国代表团接洽，要求中国代表团作中间人。五月六日上午，中国代表团答复法国方面，说明越南民主共和国代表团既已到达日内瓦，关于印度支那问题的讨论即可开始，法国提出的撤运奠边府伤俘的问题当会在会议中谈到，双方即可进行接触。当时，有关方面已经商定在五月七日举行讨论印度支那问题的会议，但在五月六日晚间，内阁危机勉强度过后，法国代表团方面对于积极寻求撤运伤病俘的姿态顿然消失了，而且在法国代表的主动下取消了在五月七日讨论印度支那问题的初步协议，这样，关于印度支那问题的讨论就被毫无道理地拖了一天。
    拉尼埃—皮杜尔用两面手法得到议会的“信任”以后，立时趾高气扬，在五月八日印度支那问题的第一次全体大会上提出了包括要“共产党军队撤出高棉、寮国”、越南民主共和国非正规军解除武装的……荒谬的“建议”。当时，日内瓦的观察家们一致指出，这个“建议”无异强迫印度支那人民拱手投降。这时，法国国内群情大哗，大多数议员都认为这是听从美国支配、不积极争取获致停火的表现。
    这一次“信任”投票一周之后，五月十三日拉尼埃又被迫要求议会就缓期辩论印度支那问题举行“信任”投票了。这次投票结果，拉尼埃仅仅赢得两票的多数，比上次减少了四十七票。许多西方资产阶级报纸称这次投票是对拉尼埃政府的“缓刑”。看看拉尼埃—皮杜尔们是怎样获得了这种“缓刑”吧：拉尼埃在巴黎向法国的议员们威胁说“日内瓦谈判能否继续，要看国民议会的态度而定”；皮杜尔则在第二次表决的前夕，从日内瓦大肆散布和平的空气，并让他的发言人在十一日举行临时记者招待会表示可以考虑范文同代外长在十日会上提出的建议，虽然法国代表团发言人在十日举行的记者招待会上曾经“坚决地”“无可考虑地”拒绝了范文同代外长的建议。
    这次法国内阁危机在五月下旬法国国民议会决定举行印度支那问题第三次辩论的时候就开始了。皮杜尔一听到议会要辩论印度支那问题，便又采取那老一套的办法，企图继续掩饰他在日内瓦会议上追随美国使印度支那战争国际化的政策，以求得国民议会对拉尼埃政府的再一次“缓刑”。
    五月二十五日，皮杜尔在会议休息时间去和周恩来外长打了一个招呼，说了几句无关紧要的话；第二天在巴黎“法兰西晚报”和“巴黎急进新闻”所出现的新闻是“恳切地谈了若干分钟”，“在外交上态度的逐渐变化具有很大的重要性；一次普通的握手不是一个自发的表现”。五月二十八日，皮杜尔又和范文同代外长握了一次手，二十九日“法兰西晚报”就报道说“在会议室旁边走廊中的会晤越来越频繁了……这是加速亚洲松弛的最好的办法”。同时皮杜尔开始奔波于日内瓦和巴黎之间，向内阁报告讨论印度支那问题的会议的进展，说服议会不要在这个时候进行辩论，以免影响日内瓦的谈判。据“世界报”五月二十七日说：法国内阁会议根据皮杜尔的报告，对“停火”协议的前途表示相当乐观，部长们赋予皮杜尔以“完全信任”……。
    显然，讨论印度支那问题的会议的有限制性是在一定程度上便利了法国当权者的欺骗宣传的。到六月八日，外长们举行讨论印度支那问题第五次全体会议时，皮杜尔又匆忙把会议迄今以来所获得的进展归功到自己的账上，并有意地把会议上存在的分歧模糊起来，似乎与会各国代表都是接受了他的建议，才使会议前进的。据一些西方记者透露，皮杜尔这一发言的内容也就是他准备十日在国民议会发言的内容，其用意是很清楚的。可是讨论印度支那问题的限制性会议的实际情形却完全不是这样的，而是正如莫洛托夫外长所说的：“显然并不是所有的会议参加者都已同样地理解到了自己的责任的。……并不是所有的与会者都关心尽速恢复印度支那的和平的”。周恩来外长在九日的会议上也指出：“法国的主战派，在日内瓦会议期间，仍然热中于美国对印度支那战争的干涉和扩大援助，而对于日内瓦会议则采取拖延政策。”
    此外，在国民议会投票表决的前一天，巴黎的报纸登载了一条美国通讯社从接近皮杜尔的人士所得到的耸人听闻的谣言，说越南民主共和国已同意将河内、海防和西贡作为法国远征军的集结地，以便进行蒙蔽和欺骗。据说，皮杜尔十日向议会讲话时，还打出了另外一张准备好的牌，那就是透露他在日内瓦曾与周恩来外长作过两次个别会晤。据“法兰西晚报”记者说：皮杜尔是想用这件事来证明他“与共产党国家代表团间已建立了牢固的联系”，议会对“他在日内瓦不真诚地寻求协议基础的指控是没有根据的”。的确，皮杜尔虽然两次会见了周恩来外长，可是据了解，他向周恩来外长所表示的却完全不能证明他有什么真正和平诚意的。
    玩弄了多少花样，使用了多少手段，但是拉尼埃政府仍不免于倒台。这说明，在日内瓦会议上法国外交家执行的阻挠印度支那和平、追求战争国际化的政策是多么不得人心。如果前两次内阁危机时，拉尼埃、皮杜尔认为是他们使用了欺骗的办法才获得“缓刑”，那显然也是错误的。事实上，上两次法国议会投信任票时，以有限和微弱的多数把拉尼埃政府保存下来，是很多人怕因内阁倒台而使停止印度支那战争的谈判受到阻碍。这正说明了国民议会中大多数人要求停止印度支那这场不得人心、耗尽法国民脂民膏的战争的迫切愿望。在五个星期后的第三次信任投票中，议会终于不得不把拉尼埃、皮杜尔内阁撵下台来，同样说明国民议会反映了法国人民要求结束这场“肮脏战争”的坚决意志。
    当然，这次拉尼埃政府的倒台与法国议会中越来越多的人反对批准欧洲军条约也是有直接关系的。六月九日，法国国民议会外交委员会以二十四票对十八票通过了莫克的关于拒绝批准欧洲军条约的报告，同日法兰西联邦大会国防委员会以十四票对七票通过反对欧洲防务集团的德古戎报告。这些事实清楚地证明了拉尼埃政府追随美国的战争政策，在议会里日益不得人心，这就不能不更加动摇了他的内阁的基础。
    随着法国内阁的倒台，以美帝国主义为首的侵略势力已在加紧散布日内瓦会议行将以失败而告结束的空气，但法国人民、印度支那人民以及全世界和平人民要求恢复印度支那和平的力量是不可抗拒的。法国内阁倒台后将产生出一个什么样的新内阁，现在还不知道，但是有一点是可以肯定的，那就是：无论任何新内阁，今后如果不坚决放弃拉尼埃皮杜尔们所遵循的追随美国扩大印度支那战争的祸国殃民的政策，真诚地以协商来谋求印度支那问题的和平解决，同样是不能为法国人民所容许的。
