    What Kind of Season Is It?
    --On V. Panova's Novel "The Seasons"
   Soviet Union　Wei Kechataofu
   Editor's note: This article was originally published in the Soviet "Pravda" on May 27. Through criticism of the novel "The Seasons," the author points out that writers cannot adopt an objectivist attitude and a naturalist descriptive method towards life; writers must deeply study the content of life, must reflect the characteristics of the times through realistic descriptions, and answer the questions posed by life. Literary works must give a correct evaluation of life, so that readers know what to love and what to hate. These opinions are worthy of attention by our country's writers.
    If the literary criticism circle has more or less determined the position of Panova's novel "The Seasons" in Soviet literature, then I would not want to discuss this work. There are various different opinions about Panova's novel. Some say that this novel is about social psychology; others think it is a depiction of daily life; and still others say: this is "life itself." Finally, there is also an opinion that "The Seasons" is a novel about education issues.
    Some certainly say that this novel has collected rich life material, the writing style is beautiful, it reads smoothly, and it also raises some life issues. --These are all undeniable.
    The fact is indeed so. But there is a serious issue that makes me, as a literary worker, feel uneasy: what kind of season's material is collected in the novel "The Seasons"? How does the author understand and arrange these materials? In general, does this novel conform to the main track of our Soviet literature development?
    When you read Panova's new work, you can't help but recall the figures in the writings of some writers many years ago, in the early days of the New Economic Policy. What we see in that kind of book is the author's one-sided and exaggerated attention to the dark side of the young Soviet reality, and the author's non-contentious attitude of trying to adopt an objectivist viewpoint. Therefore, due to the lack of ideological clarity, there is a naturalistic description, which is what Shchedrin mocked: "See a fence—say: fence; see a waist—say: waist."
    Let's take a look at the novel "The Seasons." The story of the novel takes place in modern times and depicts the life of an ordinary Soviet city. The reader is presented with many people introduced by the author as positive characters. But they undergo strange changes. When the characters in the novel are in the early stages of their life journey—the first few years of the Soviet regime—we see vivid personalities. But as soon as it involves present-day life, involving the characters' current actions—they immediately become dull. For example, Doro Feiya Kupriyanova is like this. In the best part of this novel, Doro Feiya's youth is vividly portrayed. Before us is a strong, life-loving, firm, growing... Soviet woman. Once the author moves her from one era to another—Doro Feiya immediately becomes dim and ordinary, essentially losing her personality as a staff member, who is not an important role not only in the great Soviet cause, but also in her own family.
    Her husband, Leonid Kupriyanov, also failed to withstand this "transfer" from one era to another. He became a bloodless shadow.
    Bortasevich's character has not dimmed, indeed, nor has he changed..., but this is even stranger than Doro Feiya's situation. What is strange is that we do not see at all in the novel the reasons that led him to commit crimes, deceive Soviet society, and evade legal sanctions for many years.
    Panova discarded nearly twenty-five years of time from the lives and biographies of his main characters, she discarded the years of the previous five-year plans, the years of struggle for national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, and the years of widespread socialist competition. These years could not but be reflected in the consciousness of the older generation of characters in the novel, and could not but affect the formation of their worldviews and their destinies. What about the years of the Great Patriotic War? This era only flashed in the novel, as if these years did not exist in the lives of the characters.
    Since there is none of this, since the characters have not experienced the five-year plans, nor have they experienced the war, then their images are naturally spiritually poor, and they do not possess the characteristics of our remarkable era. Critic P. Goromov wrote in the second issue of this year's "Star" magazine: "In Panova's new novel 'The Seasons,' many characters are placed in the complex interrelationships of life, and the forms used to express these interrelationships precisely point out the characteristics of our Soviet reality today."
    When you read the following passage in the novel, this assertion becomes purely ridiculous, this passage lists the "complex interrelationships of life" that can show the "characteristics of our Soviet reality today." This kind of interrelationship is like this: "People fall in love and get married; if they disagree, they get divorced; people have children, and the children should be educated, so a series of conflicts arise from education issues. Young men and women graduate from middle school or fail to achieve this due to material conditions, they enter universities or work, and leave universities, leave work. People celebrate name days and welcome the New Year, go on business trips or to sanatoriums, people think about increasing their salaries and their living space... People celebrate new homes and May Day, move into dormitories, prepare to have children and bury their relatives."
    What is pointed out here as the characteristics of Soviet reality today?
    Yes, in our time, all the phenomena that have long existed in human life have not disappeared, they exist. But, you know, the question is how it exists in life, how it exists, what forms it has that can show the characteristics of our era, and what new problems life has produced as a result, and what problems literature and art should not ignore.
    And those problems that critics believe are sharply raised in the novel, have they been resolved from the standpoint of a writer who actively strives for the victory of new and advanced things, and deeply hates all old things? No! The female writer only raised some individual facts, but avoided explaining the causes of these facts in essence.
    The root cause of why none of the characters in the novel are truly condemned may lie here. Communist Party member Bortasevich committed suicide. Communist Party member Doro Feiya Kupriyanova did not take responsibility for educating her son's anti-social behavior. The young villain Jinna Kiy escaped responsibility.
    My intention is by no means to interrogate the characters in the novel, or to conduct party disciplinary action, but to make the readers see that they are condemned by the society they are in, and condemned by the author. But it cannot be seen. One point to defend Bortasevich is that his villainous wife—a villainous element from the New Economic Policy period—dragged him into the abyss of scandal; one point to defend Doro Feiya Kupriyanova is that she loves her son very much, and at the same time her own life in her youth was very difficult, so she gave all the happiness of life that she failed to enjoy to him. And one point to defend Jinna Kiy is: he suffered enough because of that villain's knife. What conclusion do readers get as a result? It is to pity Bortasevich's children, to pity and "understand" Doro Feiya and her son, to be surprised that excellent children are cultivated in the families of villains, and that villains are cultivated in the families of those who shed blood for the Soviet regime, so you will think: such things exist in the world.
    If so, if the task the author of the novel "The Seasons" has set for herself is only to express "things that exist in life," without giving any evaluation of these things, then she is embarking on the path of naturalism. Naturalism explains nothing. Naturalism can make people happy, surprised, touch certain emotions, but it can never make profound, life-realistic, social and artistic generalizations.
    What readers expect from our Soviet writers is not books that say "there is this kind of situation in life," but answers to the problems that occur in life. Writing the truth of life—this is not simply capturing the surface phenomena of life, but deeply thinking about the phenomena of life, pointing out the struggle between new and old things, and promoting the victory of the advanced, new and progressive. This is the requirement of the method of socialist realism.
    We, the readers who are accustomed to treating writers as teachers of life, are willing to see in our books characters that they can emulate, learn from, and follow, and to see the labor, struggle, and conflict of characters with the embodiment of old, outdated, and alien ideas. The struggle between the new and the old—this is the foundation of our development.
    I am convinced that, according to the life atmosphere of the novel "The Seasons," according to most of its characters (even the elementary school student Seryocha and his diary are very close to Kosga Lyambutsev [Note]), this novel clearly echoes several works in the early days of the New Economic Policy, and at the same time, the major problems and practical problems of that time are not reflected at all in this novel.
    When reading this novel, the full error of the author's objectivist and naturalist attitude towards describing life is clearly visible. M. Shaginina, in an essay praising "The Seasons" published in "Izvestia," talked about Panova's handling of the plot in this way: "...the name 'The Seasons' itself seems to say to the reader: I make my characters go through the most natural, inevitable plot process, through the process of the seasons, through the changes of spring, summer, autumn, and winter."
    People—are not Gramineae plants, so making them explain nothing through spring, summer, autumn and winter themselves. Moreover, there are various kinds of seasons. For example, it is one thing to let a person go through the autumn of 1911, and it is another thing to let him go through the revolutionary autumn of 1917. The summer of 1941, when the country gathered all its strength to repel the fierce attack of the Hitler bandits, was one thing, and this year's peaceful spring is another.
    It is not only about time, but about what kind of time it is. How is time, how are social life events, then what kind of influence will it have on people, what will their actions and character be, and what will the problem be.
    But Panova can arbitrarily discard the entire era of twenty-five to thirty years from the lives of the characters: because time is only the alternation of spring, summer, autumn and winter. Since it is an alternation, then there is no difference whether the time is longer or shorter!
    Here I want to talk about the following point. I want to ask a question: why would Panova, a person who is by no means just starting to write, write a novel "The Seasons" that is outside the spirit, problems and characters of our time? Why does her novel distort the image of our contemporary people—the Soviet people, especially the Communists?
    I think the matter lies in: to write about our era is to first write about new people, to write about new people precisely in our era, which means to oppose everything that is conventional, outdated and backward with extraordinary enthusiasm, and at the same time to confirm new things with extraordinary enthusiasm, and to become an active fighter for new things. Literary artists, like all Soviet people, should respond to the call of the Communist Party, should bravely carry out criticism and self-criticism, and burn away everything negative, decadent, dead, and everything that hinders progress in life. At the same time, our writers should reveal the new type of people in affirmative artistic images, and reveal all the magnificence of their human dignity.
    Realistic literature—Russian or foreign classical works, always struggled for something, attacked something and affirmed something. It raised the most important questions in life, and tried to solve them; it aroused great emotions, it made people love this and hate that. Advanced realistic literature determined the noble ideals of the time and created images of heroic and fearless warriors who fought for these ideals.
    Along with this great torrent, there are various literary schools. Among these schools is vulgar literature, which is neither concerned with destroying this nor concerned with affirming that, nor does it make people produce great emotions—love or hate. It is only concerned with how to "arrange" its characters, how to evoke sympathy, pity for them, and to make readers "imagine for them," "understand" them. The author of the novel "The Seasons" calls on us to "understand" and "pity" Doro Feiya Kupriyanova, who is weak-willed and weak in family life; to "pity" Bortasevich, who left the path of integrity, to "sympathize" with his unfortunate family, to "sympathize" with all the people who finally "arrange themselves" in life.
    To describe such a world, there is no need for the characteristics of the era. The happiness of the petty bourgeoisie and the acrimony of the petty bourgeoisie wander from one era to another without much change.
  Until now, the Writers' Association has not launched a principled discussion on the novel "The Seasons." Has this novel pushed our literature forward, or has the most important task of Soviet literature—educating young people and forming young people's worldviews and tastes—been sacrificed in this stimulating taste?
    In my opinion, this novel has not only failed to push our literature forward—it may also push some of our writers onto the path of vulgar literature that is incompatible with the spirit of Soviet literature.

    这是什么样的季节？
    ——关于维·潘诺娃的小说“一年四季”
   苏联　维·科柴托夫
   编者按：本文原载五月二十七日苏联“真理报”。作者通过对小说“一年四季”的批评，指出作家对生活不能采取客观主义的态度和自然主义的描写方法；作家必须深刻地研究生活内容，必须通过真实的描写，反映时代的特征，回答生活所提出的问题。文学作品必须给生活以正确的评价，使读者知所爱憎。这些意见值得我国作家们注意。
    如果文学批评界多少已经确定了潘诺娃的长篇小说“一年四季”在苏联文学中的地位，那么我是不想来谈论这部作品的。对于潘诺娃的小说有着各种各样不同的意见。有些人说，这本小说是关于社会心理学的；另外一些人认为它是描写日常生活的；还有些人说：这就是“生活本身”。最后，也有一种意见，认为“一年四季”是一部有关教育问题的长篇小说。
    有人肯定说，这本小说中搜集了丰富的生活材料，文体优美，读起来流畅，同时也提出了一些生活中的问题。——这些都是不能不使人同意的。
    事实确是如此。但是有一个严重的问题使作为文学工作者的我感到不安：小说“一年四季”中搜集的是什么样的季节的材料？作者又怎样理解和安排这些材料？总的来说，这本小说是否符合我们苏联文学发展的主要轨道呢？
    你读一读潘诺娃的新作品，你的眼前就不由得浮现出许多年前、还在新经济政策初期的某些作家笔下的那些人物。我们在那类书中所看到的，是作者片面地夸大地注意年轻的苏维埃实际情况的阴暗面，是努力采取客观主义观点的作者的与世无争的态度。因此，思想上缺乏明确性，也就发生了自然主义的描写，这种描写就是谢德林所嘲笑的：“看见篱笆——就说：篱笆；看见腰部——就说：腰部。”
    我们来看一看小说“一年四季”。小说的故事发生在现代，所描写的是一个普通苏联城市的生活。在读者面前涌现出作者所介绍的当做正面人物的许多人。但是他们发生着奇怪的变化。当小说的人物在他们生活路程的初期——苏维埃政权最初几年——时，我们看到了活生生的性格。但是一涉及现时生活，涉及人物目前的行动，——他们就立刻黯然失色了。例如，道罗菲娅·库普里雅诺娃就是这样。在这本小说最好的部分，鲜明地表现出了道罗菲娅的青年时代。我们面前是一个刚毅的、热爱生活的、坚定的、在成长中的……苏联妇女。一当作者把她从一个时代移到另一个时代，——道罗菲娅就立即变得暗淡无光，变成了一个平凡的、实质上是失掉了个性的工作人员，她不仅在伟大的苏维埃事业中、而且在自己的家庭中都不是一个重要角色了。
    她的丈夫列奥尼德·库普里雅诺夫也没有能经得起这种从一个时代到另一个时代的“转移”。他变成了一个没有血肉的影子。
    包尔塔舍维奇这个人物并没有黯淡下去，确实是，也没有变化……，可是这比道罗菲娅的情况更加奇怪。奇怪的是，我们在小说中完全没有看见那在许多年间促使他犯罪、欺骗苏维埃社会、逃避法律制裁的原因。
    潘诺娃从他的主要人物的生活中、传记中，抛掉了将近二十五年的时光，她抛掉了前几个五年计划的年代、争取国家工业化、农业集体化的斗争年代，抛掉了那些广泛展开社会主义竞赛的年代。这些年代是无论如何也不能不反映到小说中老一代人物的意识中的，不能不影响他们的世界观的形成和他们的命运的。伟大的卫国战争年代怎样呢？这个年代在小说中只是闪了一下，在人物的生活中好像没有这几年一样。
    既然没有这一些，既然人物没有经历过五年计划、也没有经历过战争，那么他们的形象自然是精神上贫乏的，他们没有具备我们这一卓越时代的特点。批评家普·哥罗莫夫在“星”杂志今年第二期上写道：“在潘诺娃的新小说‘一年四季’里，许多人物都置身在生活的错综复杂的相互关系中，用以表现这些相互关系的形式恰正指出了我们今天的苏维埃实际情况的特征。”
    当你读到小说中的下面一段时，这种断言就变成纯粹可笑的了，这一段列举了能够表明“我们今天的苏维埃实际情况特征”的“生活的错综复杂的相互关系”。这种相互关系是这样：“人们相爱和结婚；不和睦了，就离婚；人们有了孩子，孩子应该教育，于是从教育问题产生了一系列冲突。青年男女在中学毕业或者由于物质条件而未能达到这一点，他们升入大学或工作，以及离开大学，离开工作。人们庆祝命名日和迎接新年，出差或到休养所去，人们想着扩大自己的薪金和自己的住宅面积……人们庆祝新居和五一节，搬到宿舍中去，准备生小孩和为自己的亲人送葬。”
    这里指出今天苏维埃实际情况特征的是什么呢？
    是的，在我们今天，凡是人类生活中久已存在的现象都没有消失，它是存在着的。但是，要知道，问题在于它是怎样地存在于生活之中，它是怎样地存在着，在于它有着哪些足以表明我们这个时代特征的形式，以及生活因此产生了哪些新的问题，提出了文学和艺术不应置之不理的哪些问题。
    而批评家们认为在小说中尖锐地提出的那些问题，如果从一个积极争取新的、先进事物的胜利，而对一切陈旧的事物深恶痛绝的作家的立场来看，是否已经解决了呢？没有！这位女作家只是提出了一些个别的事实，却避免从实质上来解释产生这些事实的原因。
    小说中没有一个人物真正受到了谴责的根源，可能就在此。共产党员包尔塔舍维奇自杀了。共产党员道罗菲娅·库普里雅诺娃对儿子的反社会行为，没有负起教育的责任。年青的坏蛋金纳几依逃脱了责任。
    我的意思决不是说要对小说中的人物进行审讯，或是进行党内的处理，而是应该使读者看到他们受到他们所处的社会的谴责，受到作者的谴责。可是看不到。给包尔塔舍维奇辩解的一点是，他的坏蛋妻子——新经济政策时期的坏分子使他陷入了丑事的深渊，给道罗菲娅·库普里雅诺娃辩解的一点是，她很爱自己的儿子，同时她本身在青年时代的生活很艰苦，于是她把自己未能享受到的生活的全部幸福都投给了他。而给金纳几依辩解的一点是：他由于那坏蛋的刀而受够了苦。这样一来，读者得到了什么样的结论呢？就是要怜惜包尔塔舍维奇的孩子，怜惜和“理解”道罗菲娅和她的儿子，要惊讶在坏人的家庭中培育出了极好的孩子，而在那些曾为苏维埃政权流过血的人的家庭中却培育出了坏蛋，这样你就会想：世界上就有这样的事。
    如果这样，如果小说“一年四季”的作者给自己提出的任务只是表现“生活中存在的”事情，而对于这种事情不给以任何评价，那么她就是走上了自然主义的道路。自然主义是什么也不说明的。自然主义能够使人快乐、惊奇，触动某些情感，但是决不能做出深刻的、生活上真实的、社会的和艺术的概括。
    读者期待于我们苏联作家的，不是“生活中有这种情况”的图书，而是对生活中发生的问题的回答。写生活的真实情况——这并不是简单地摄下生活的表面现象，而是深刻地思考生活的现象，指明新事物和旧事物的斗争，促使先进的、新的和进步的获得胜利。社会主义现实主义方法的要求就是这样。
    我们习惯于把作家当做生活的教师的读者们，愿意在我们的书中看到他们可以仿效、可以学习、可以追随的人物，看到人物的劳动、斗争以及与陈旧、过时和异己思想的体现者的冲突。新与旧的斗争——这就是我们发展的基础。
    我确信，根据“一年四季”小说的生活气氛，根据它的大多数人物（甚至于小学生谢辽查和他的日记都很接近于科斯加·梁布采夫〔注〕）看来，这本小说显然与新经济政策初期的几部著作相呼应，同时，当时的重大问题、实际问题，在这本小说中却一点都没有反映出来。
    读这本小说时，可以明显看出作者描写生活的客观主义和自然主义态度的全部错误。姆·沙吉宁在“消息报”所发表的他的一篇赞美“一年四季”的论文中，曾这样谈到潘诺娃处理情节的手法：“……‘一年四季’这个名称本身，就好像是对读者说：我使我的人物通过最自然的、我们不可避免的情节过程，通过季节的过程，通过春、夏、秋、冬的变化。”
    人——不是禾本科的植物，使他们通过春夏秋冬本身说明不了任何问题。况且四季也有各种各样的。例如，让一个人通过一九一一年的秋季是一回事，让他去通过一九一七年的革命的秋季则又是另一回事。一九四一年夏天，当国家鼓起全力击退希特勒匪徒的猛烈进攻时是一回事，而今年的和平的春天则又是另一种样子了。
    事情不仅在于时间，而在于这是什么样的时间。时间是怎样，社会生活事件是怎样，那么对于人也就有怎样的影响，他们的行动和性格便会是怎样，问题也就是怎样。
    而潘诺娃却可以把二十五年至三十年的整个时代都任意从人物的生活中抛掉：因为时间只不过是春夏秋冬的更替而已。既然是更替，那么时间长些、短些是没有丝毫区别的！
    在这里我想谈谈下边这一点。我想提一个问题：为什么潘诺娃这样一位决不是刚开始写作的人会写出精神、问题和人物处在我们时代之外的小说
  “一年四季”呢？为什么在她的小说中歪曲了我们同时代人——苏联人的形象，特别是共产党人的形象呢？
    我认为，事情在于：要写我们的时代就是说首先要写新人，写正是我们时代的新人，这就是说要异常热情地反对一切因循、过时和落后的事物，同时要异常热情地确认新事物，成为争取新事物的积极战士。文字艺术家和全体苏联人一样响应共产党的号召，应该勇敢地进行批评和自我批评，烧掉生活中一切否定的、腐朽的、死亡的和一切阻碍前进的东西。同时，我们的作家要在肯定的艺术形象中揭示出新型的人，揭示出他们的人的尊严的全部壮丽。
    现实主义的文艺——俄罗斯的或是外国的古典作品，总是为了什么而斗争，抨击了什么和肯定了什么。它提出了生活中最重大的问题，企图加以解决；它唤起伟大的感情，它让人爱这个，憎恨那个。先进的现实主义的文学确定了当时的高尚理想，创造了为这些理想而斗争的英勇无畏的战士形象。
    同这一巨流在一起的，有各种文学流派。这些流派之中有庸俗的文学，它既不关心摧毁这个，也不关心肯定那个，它也没有使人产生伟大的感情——爱或憎。它所关心的只是怎样“安排”自己的人物，怎样唤起对他们的同情、怜悯，使读者“替他们设想”，“了解”他们。小说“一年四季”的作者号召我们“了解”和“怜悯”在家庭生活中意志薄弱和软弱的道罗菲娅·库普里雅诺娃；“怜悯”离开正直道路的包尔塔舍维奇，“同情”他的不幸的家庭，“同情”那最后在生活中“安排自己”的所有的人。
    为了描写这样的世界，是不需要时代的特征的。小市民的幸福和小市民的酸辛是由这一时代游荡到另一时代而没有多少变化的。
  直到现在为止，作家协会还没有对小说“一年四季”展开过原则性的讨论。这部小说是否把我们的文学推向前进了呢，还是苏联文学最主要的任务——教育青年、形成青年的世界观和趣味——被牺牲在这种刺激性的趣味之中了呢。
    依我看来，这本小说不仅没有把我们的文学推向前进，——它还可能把我们的一些作家推上与苏维埃文学精神格格不入的庸俗文学的道路上去。
