Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 6th. Supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural and forestry departments in the vast rice and cotton producing areas of Central South China are mobilizing large quantities of agricultural chemicals, agricultural machinery, and fertilizers to help farmers control rice and cotton pests and diseases and apply topdressing fertilizer. The current inventory of agricultural chemicals in the entire region is sufficient to apply two to three catties per mu to all cotton fields sown with improved cotton varieties this year. The inventory of agricultural machinery is more than double the quantity currently held by farmers. Currently, aphids have been found in some cotton-producing areas of Henan Province and in Xiangyang, Songzi, and other places in Hubei Province. Local supply and marketing cooperatives are providing farmers with agricultural chemicals and machinery. By mid-May, the fertilizer reserves in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Guangxi provinces were approximately 50% higher than in the same period last year. Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Henan provinces alone purchased more than 20,000 tons of cake fertilizer from Northeast China and Hubei Province. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions are transporting these fertilizers to grain and cotton producing areas, with the vast majority to be supplied to farmers in June, July, and August for use as topdressing fertilizer for rice and cotton fields.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 6th. Currently, cotton, peanuts, corn, and other crops in Jiangsu Province are generally emerging, and rice transplanting has begun. Various pests are also becoming active. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels throughout the province are providing farmers with seven million catties of agricultural chemicals and nearly 20,000 various types of sprayers to kill pests. There are many varieties of pesticides being supplied, mainly including emulsions, rotenone, lime sulfur mixture, and various compositions of "666" pesticide powder.
    In supplying agricultural chemicals and machinery, supply and marketing cooperatives in many regions have strengthened technical guidance for farmers. Songjiang and Yancheng regions have trained more than 300 supply personnel, who actively introduce the development patterns of pests and diseases, as well as methods for preparing pesticides and prevention methods, to farmers when selling agricultural chemicals and machinery. Cadres from supply and marketing cooperatives in Lianshui, Huaiyin, and other counties package pesticide powder into small bags and send them to the countryside, selling them while teaching farmers how to use them.

    中南区和江苏省各地供销合作社
    调集大批农药和药械供应农民防治病虫害
    【新华社武汉六日电】中南区广大产稻区和产棉区的供销合作社和农林部门，正调集大批农业药剂、农业药械和肥料，帮助农民除治稻棉虫害和施用追肥。现在全区储存的农业药剂足够今年全区已播种了优良棉种的棉田每亩施用二斤到三斤，储存的农业药械比农民手中现有的数量还多一倍多。目前，河南省部分产棉区和湖北省襄阳、松滋等地的棉田已经发现蚜虫，当地供销合作社正把农业药剂和农业药械供给农民。到五月中，湖南、湖北、江西、广西四省储备的肥料约比去年同期多百分之五十。湖南、广东、江西、广西、河南五省仅从东北、湖北两地买进的饼肥就有两万多吨。各地供销合作社正把这些肥料向粮、棉产区调运，绝大部分将在六、七、八三个月中供给农民用作稻田、棉田追肥。
   【新华社南京六日电】目前，江苏省的棉花、花生、玉米等作物普遍出苗，水稻开始插秧，各种害虫也开始活跃起来。全省各级供销合作社正把七百万斤农业药剂和近两万架各式喷雾器供给农民毒杀害虫。所供应的农药品种很多，主要的有乳剂、鱼藤精、石灰硫磺合剂和各种成分的“六六六”药粉。
    很多地区的供销合作社在供应农业药剂、药械中，加强了对农民的技术指导。松江、盐城两专区训练了三百多个供应人员，这些人员在推销农业药剂、药械时，积极向农民介绍病虫害的发展规律以及配制药剂和防治的方法。涟水、淮阴等县的供销合作社的干部把药粉装成小包送下乡去，一面推销，一面教会农民使用。
