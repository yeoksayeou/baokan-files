Fujian Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau has decided to massively purchase various types of miscellaneous timber to supply East and North China for manufacturing agricultural tools and ships.

Miscellaneous timber is a general term for timber trees other than the main timber trees such as pine and fir. The province has an extremely rich reserve of miscellaneous timber, estimated at over 64 million cubic meters, accounting for about half of the province's total forest reserves. This year's output will increase to 100,000 cubic meters, more than thirteen times the amount of last year. There are also more than 200 species of miscellaneous trees. The species to be purchased this year include: oak, camphor, yellow sandalwood, wild jujube, elm, mountain peach, and nanmu. The miscellaneous timber produced this year will be shipped out to supply the needs of the shipbuilding industry, textile industry, and basic construction in East and North China, and will also be transported to Jiangsu, Shanghai, Shandong and other places for making agricultural tools. Some miscellaneous timber will also be used to manufacture furniture, sports equipment, and so on.

This year's miscellaneous timber purchasing points are located in eight special districts and the suburbs of Fuzhou. The state's purchase of miscellaneous timber not only enables the province's miscellaneous timber to be fully utilized but also greatly increases the income of farmers in forest areas. It is estimated that this year the mountain price and wages of miscellaneous timber earned by farmers in forest areas can increase their income by more than 20 billion yuan. In the past, the masses did not cherish the maple tree at all, and even disliked using it as firewood because they felt its firepower was not strong. However, this year the state plans to purchase thousands of cubic meters of maple, and this item alone can increase farmers' income by more than 800 million yuan.

In the past, the market was generally only interested in large timber and not small timber. Therefore, farmers who felled miscellaneous timber often discarded the small timber on the mountains to rot, resulting in a great waste. For example, the utilization rate of miscellaneous timber that has grown for 50 years is only about 60%. In order to make rational use of the leftover top wood in this year's miscellaneous timber production process, the Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau has decided to reduce the miscellaneous timber specifications that have been used in the past from 20 centimeters in diameter to 15 centimeters and even 10 centimeters.

### 福建省大量生产杂木供应华东华北需要

    福建省大量生产杂木供应华东华北需要
    福建省森林工业局决定大量收购各种杂木，供应华东、华北等地制造农具和船只。
    杂木是除了松、杉等主要用材林木以外的林木的总称。该省杂木的蓄积量极为丰富，估计在六千四百万立方公尺以上，约占全省森林总蓄积量的一半。今年的产量将增加到十万立方公尺，比去年增加十三倍多。杂木的树种亦有两百多种。今年收购的树种有：柯木、香樟、黄檀、山枣、刨花榆、山桃、楠木等。今年所生产的杂木将源源外调供应华东、华北等地造船工业、纺织工业和本省基本建设的需要，同时还准备运到江苏、上海、山东等地供制农具。有些杂木还将用来制造家具、运动器械等等。
    今年杂木的收购点遍及八个专区和福州市郊。国家对杂木的收购，不仅使该省杂木得以充分利用，并使林区农民大大地增加收入，估计今年林区农民所得杂木的山价和工资，就可增加两百多亿元的收入。枫香树过去群众对它毫不爱惜，甚至因嫌它火力不强，还不愿用来当柴火烧，而今年国家计划收购的枫香就达数千立方公尺，光这一项就能给农民增加收入八亿元以上。
    过去市场的习惯，一般只要大材，不要小材，因而砍伐杂木的农民，往往把小材丢弃在山上任其腐朽，造成极大的浪费；像生长达五十年的杂木，其利用率仅达百分之六十左右。省森林工业局为使今年杂木生产过程中所剩下的梢头木能得到合理的利用，已决定将历来使用的杂木规格，由直径二十公分降低到十五公分以至十公分。
