    Xinhua News Agency: Generally Good Growth of Over 50 Million Mu of Rice in Sichuan Province, Zhejiang Farmers Complete Ramie Sowing Task According to National Plan
    In Sichuan Province, over 50 million mu of rice are generally growing well. In the Luzhou, Yibin, and Jiangjin regions, the intermediate rice is already over three chi (about 3 feet) tall. In Luxian, Fushun, Yibin, Naxi, and other counties, the early rice of double-cropping rice has already headed, and the late rice seedlings have grown to four or five cun (inches) in height.

    This year, Sichuan Province has newly built and repaired over 300,000 small-scale water conservancy projects, increasing the irrigated area. The rice planting area in various places is larger than last year. The Jiangjin and Nanchong regions alone have expanded the rice area by more than 400,000 mu. After transplanting, mutual aid and cooperative organizations led the vast number of farmers to weed, topdress, and prevent and control diseases and insect pests in a timely manner, striving for a bumper harvest in the autumn. Jiajiang County convened a symposium of agricultural production cooperative technicians, mutual aid team leaders, and elderly farmers to study methods for early topdressing, shallow water irrigation, and prevention of natural disasters. Farmers in the Dujiangyan irrigation area, under the guidance of thirty-nine rice water use experimental stations, are experimenting with shallow water irrigation. In the Neijiang, Luzhou, Wanxian and other regions, many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have led individual farmers to take turns storing water, weeding in turn, and drying fields in a timely manner, overcoming the contradictions of shallow water weeding, draining fields, and storing water which had not been overcome for many years.

    In Zhejiang Province, the main ramie producing area in the country, farmers have completed this year's ramie sowing task. According to the plan, Zhejiang Province farmers have maintained last year's ramie planting area this year and are preparing to increase the unit area yield by over 20% to meet the country's growing need for industrial raw materials. This year, Zhejiang Province's ramie farmers have further promoted advanced techniques such as seed dressing with pesticides, warm water soaking of seeds, and strip planting with close spacing in ramie sowing. Most of the hemp fields have been sown with high-quality hemp seeds such as Taima and Jiatouma. At present, in Haining, Xiaoshan, Hangxian, and other early-sowing areas, the hemp seedlings have emerged about four cun in height, and farmers are carrying out seedling transplantation, thinning, soil shaving, and fertilization. Although the sowing in some areas is slightly later, farmers are still very confident. They are preparing to realize this year's production increase plan by applying additional fertilizer and strengthening field management. (Xinhua News Agency)

    四川省五千多万亩水稻一般生长良好
    浙江省农民按照国家计划完成络麻播种任务
    四川省五千多万亩水稻一般生长良好。泸州、宜宾、江津等专区的中稻已高约三尺多。泸县、富顺、宜宾、纳溪等县的双季稻，早稻已经抽穗，晚稻秧苗也长到四五寸高。
    今年四川省由于新修和整修小型水利工程三十多万处，灌溉面积增加，各地水稻种植面积多比去年扩大。仅江津、南充两个专区就扩大了四十多万亩水稻。插秧完毕后，各地互助合作组织带动广大农民及时薅秧、追肥和防治病虫害，争取秋季丰收。夹江县召集农业生产合作社技术员、互助组组长和老年农民举行座谈会，研究了关于早期追肥、浅水灌溉和防止自然灾害等办法。都江堰流域的农民在三十九个水稻用水试验站指导下试行了浅水灌溉。在内江、泸州、万县等专区，许多农业生产合作社、互助组带动单干农民轮流囤水、轮流薅秧和及时晒田，克服了多年来没有能克服的浅水薅秧、放水晒田和蓄水保水的矛盾。         （新华社）

    全国络麻主要产区的浙江省，农民已完成今年络麻的播种任务。按照计划，浙江省农民今年保持了去年络麻的种植面积，并准备提高单位面积产量百分之二十强，以适应国家日益增长的工业原料的需要。浙江省植麻农民今年在播种络麻中，进一步推广了药剂拌种、温汤浸种和条播密植等先进技术，绝大部分麻田播下台麻和荚头麻等优良麻种。目前海宁、萧山、杭县等早播地区麻苗已出土四寸左右，农民正在进行移苗、间苗、削土、施肥等工作。部分地区虽播种稍迟，农民信心仍然很高，他们准备以追施肥料、加强田间管理等办法，来实现今年的增产计划。                   （新华社）
