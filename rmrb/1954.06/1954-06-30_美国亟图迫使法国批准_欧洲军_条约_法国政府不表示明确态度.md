Xinhua News Agency, June 29th: Paris dispatch: The French government refused the proposal of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg on the 25th to hold a meeting of the six foreign ministers of the "European Army" in early July. The French government stated that holding such a meeting would be "inappropriate" before a consensus on the "European Army" issue had been reached domestically.

This meeting of the six foreign ministers, aimed at discussing ways to implement the "European Defense Community," is one of a series of recent activities taken by the United States to pressure France to approve the "European Army" treaty. Reuters reporter Harold King reported: "Key officials in the Mendès France cabinet say they have detected American pressure behind the scenes... They believe it is no coincidence that British Foreign Secretary Eden issued an appeal to France to join the European Defense Community in the same week that the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg suggested holding a hasty meeting on the issue." It is known that after the fall of the French Laniel government, the United States became even more concerned that France's ratification of the "European Army" treaty would be further delayed, and has therefore constantly put pressure on France. As early as June 15, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles publicly threatened at a press conference that if France did not ratify the "European Army" treaty, "aid" to France would be cancelled from next year. Subsequently, the White House published a letter from U.S. President Eisenhower to French President Coty on the 18th, in which the U.S. government more explicitly forced France to follow U.S. policy. Some U.S. government officials also suggested that if France continued to delay the ratification of the "European Army" treaty, the United States would arm West Germany unilaterally. Under the instruction of the United States, the foreign ministers of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg also publicly stated that they were prepared to consider allowing West Germany to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization "on an equal footing" as a substitute for the "European Defense Community."

However, due to the powerful movement of the French people against the "European Army" plan, and the existence of serious divisions within the French ruling bloc on the "European Army" issue, the Mendès France government does not dare to express a clear attitude on the "European Army" issue.

    美国亟图迫使法国批准“欧洲军”条约
    法国政府不表示明确态度
    【新华社二十九日讯】巴黎消息：法国政府在二十五日拒绝了荷、比、卢三国关于在七月初召开“欧洲军”六国外长会议的建议。法国政府表示：在国内还没有对“欧洲军”问题得到一致意见以前，举行这样的会议“不合时宜”。
    这次旨在讨论实施“欧洲防务集团”的办法的六国外长会议，是美国最近采取的一连串企图压迫法国批准“欧洲军”条约的新的活动之一。路透社记者哈罗德·金报道说：“孟戴斯—弗朗斯内阁的重要官员们说，他们发现幕后有美国的压力……他们认为，在同一个星期中，英国外交大臣艾登对法国发出要求它参加欧洲防务集团的呼吁，而荷比卢三国又建议就这个问题举行仓促的会议，这并不是偶然凑在一起的。”大家知道，法国拉尼埃政府倒台以后，美国更加担心法国批准“欧洲军”条约一事将被进一步拖延，因此曾不断地对法国施加压力。早在六月十五日，美国国务卿杜勒斯在一次记者招待会上公开威胁说：如果法国不批准“欧洲军”条约，从明年起就要取消对法国的“援助”。接着白宫在十八日发表了美国总统艾森豪威尔给法国总统戈蒂的信，在这封信中，美国政府更加露骨地逼迫法国追随美国的政策。美国政府一些官员还放出空气说，如果法国继续拖延批准“欧洲军”条约，美国就要单独武装西德。荷、比、卢三国外交大臣在美国的授意下也公开表示，他们准备考虑让西德“以平等的地位”参加北大西洋公约组织，作为代替“欧洲防务集团”的办法。
    但是由于法国人民反对“欧洲军”计划的强大运动而且在法国统治集团内部对“欧洲军”问题也存在着严重分歧，孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府对“欧洲军”问题不敢表示明确的态度。
