The cadres of Harbin's municipal organizations and students from universities and colleges have been participating in voluntary labor to green the city during their spare time since April. They have planted 1.2 million beautiful pine trees, lilacs, and shrubs along some streets, in the Stalin Park along the river, and in the Jiangbei Plain scenic area. The plain scenic area on the north bank of the Songhua River is where employees of factories and organizations in Harbin gather for recuperation during the summer. However, the area was flooded during the flood season last year. Therefore, under the leadership of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Harbin Municipal People's Government, those participating in voluntary labor began constructing a dike more than 5,800 meters long on May 21. Currently, an average of more than 2,000 cadres, students, and soldiers are participating in this project every day. It is estimated that this flood prevention dike will be completed by the end of July. (Report from our Northeast Reporter Station)

    松花江北岸的风景区将更加美丽了
    哈尔滨市机关干部和高等学校的学生们，从四月份利用公余课余时间参加绿化城市的义务劳动以来，现已在部分街道旁、沿江的斯大林公园里和江北平原风景区内，栽植了一百二十万棵美丽的松树、丁香和灌木树等。松花江北岸的平原风景区是哈尔滨各工厂机关职工们暑期集中休养的地方，但该区曾在去年汛期被水淹没，因此参加义务劳动的人们在中共哈尔滨市委和哈尔滨市人民政府的领导下，在五月二十一日开始修建一条长达五千八百多公尺的围堤。目前每天平均有二千多名干部、学生和战士们参加了这项工程，预计这条防止水患的围堤，将在七月底全部完工。（本报东北记者站）
