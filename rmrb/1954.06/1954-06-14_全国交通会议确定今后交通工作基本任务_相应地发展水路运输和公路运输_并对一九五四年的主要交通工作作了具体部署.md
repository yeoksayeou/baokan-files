Xinhua News Agency, June 13th: The Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government recently convened the 1954 National Transportation Conference. This conference summarized the national transportation work of 1953, studied the current basic situation and future basic tasks of the transportation industry, deployed the work for 1954, and focused on discussions regarding how to implement planned management and how to carry out the socialist transformation of capitalist transportation and individual transportation businesses.

The summary of the 1953 transportation work showed that the transportation sector completed the state plan last year and carried out necessary reforms. Throughout the year, the volume of freight transported by directly affiliated river and ocean shipping completed 108.2% of the plan; freight turnover completed 108% of the plan; transportation costs decreased by 4.6% compared to the plan; labor productivity completed 111.75% of the plan; and profits and basic depreciation are projected to complete 154.57% of the plan; the five major coastal ports of Dalian, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Guangzhou completed 113.42% of their planned throughput; the national automobile passenger and freight turnover completed 119.15% of the plan; and the national local inland river freight turnover completed 107.84% of the plan. In terms of capital construction, the highways constructed with central investment completed 960 kilometers according to standards, initially opened 790 kilometers, and renovated 1,058 kilometers. In addition, 7,846 kilometers of field surveys were completed, and 6,210 kilometers of designs were produced. The surveying and design work for the reconstruction and construction of major bridges was also fully completed. Key navigation construction projects invested in by the central government have been fully completed according to plan. Private coastal and Yangtze River shipping industries have been brought into the orbit of the state plan through joint management or public-private partnerships, and the supplementary work of democratic reform and democratic reform in the water transport sector has been completed. Local transportation work also made better progress in 1953. While affirming the above achievements, the meeting reviewed the shortcomings in the work, especially the significant problem of frequent accidents.

The meeting believed that the current overall basic situation of the transportation industry is: insufficient transportation capacity, the potential of existing equipment has not been fully utilized, the level of enterprise management is low, technical equipment is weak and backward, the rich natural resources have not been well utilized, there is a large number of non-socialist economic components, cadres lack proficiency in business and there is a shortage of technical personnel, all of which indicate the backwardness of China's current transportation industry. However, the development of the country's socialist industry, especially the shipbuilding, automobile manufacturing, and petroleum industries, as well as other conditions, will be beneficial to the future development of modernized transportation. The basic tasks of future transportation work are: according to the overall plan for national economic development, correspondingly develop waterway and highway transportation, gradually and systematically carry out technological transformation in a planned and targeted manner, actively, steadily, and systematically carry out socialist transformation of capitalist transportation and individual transportation businesses with differentiation, in order to gradually change the backwardness of China's transportation industry, adapt to the growing transportation needs of industrial and agricultural production, commodity circulation, the people's material and cultural life, and the requirements of national defense construction, and better serve the overall task of the state's transitional period and the state's socialist construction.

At present, China's railway transportation bears an excessive burden. The meeting drew on advanced Soviet experience and believed that it is necessary to fully utilize China's natural and excellent conditions for waterway transportation, gradually increase the proportion of inland river and coastal transportation, in order to cooperate with the railway to complete the state's huge transportation tasks, and appropriately develop ocean transportation. Automobile transportation plays a very important role in short-distance transportation between areas, transportation in areas where railway and waterway transportation is underdeveloped, and has a very important role in the socialist transformation of agriculture and the growth of agricultural productive forces. Therefore, it is necessary to gradually develop highway transportation to cooperate with railway and waterway transportation to complete the task of urban and rural material exchange.

The tasks of the transportation sector in 1954 are even more arduous. According to the state plan, this year's total freight volume directly under the jurisdiction of the rivers and seas will increase by 30% compared with last year, the total freight turnover will increase by 38% compared with last year, and the amount of capital construction work will increase by 12% compared with last year. In order to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the 1954 plan and various major indicators, the meeting believed that it is necessary to implement and carry out the spirit of this National Transportation Conference and the established policies and guidelines, and on the basis of strengthening the responsibility system, with the effective implementation of planned management as the center, ensure safe production, improve efficiency, ensure quality, strengthen technical management and financial management, promote advanced experience, tap potential capacity, further improve the management level of enterprises, strengthen leadership over joint public-private enterprises, and strengthen the socialist transformation of capitalist transportation and individual transportation businesses.

The meeting made specific arrangements for this year's main tasks, and emphasized that: it is necessary to enhance unity and improve collective leadership, it is necessary to strengthen ideological leadership and political work in enterprises, it is necessary to strengthen the study of business, learn advanced Soviet science and technology and advanced experience, it is necessary to improve leadership style and leadership methods, and especially to conduct purposeful, planned, and regular in-depth inspections in order to effectively discover and gradually solve key problems in the work.

This conference was held in Beijing from May 11th to 20th. A total of 136 people attended the conference, including the directors of the transportation bureaus of the major regions, the minister of transportation of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the directors and managers of the various specialized administrations and companies of ocean shipping, river shipping, navigation engineering, and highway engineering directly under the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government, and representatives of relevant departments of the Central People's Government.

    全国交通会议确定今后交通工作基本任务
    相应地发展水路运输和公路运输
    并对一九五四年的主要交通工作作了具体部署
   【新华社十三日讯】中央人民政府交通部在最近召开了一九五四年全国交通会议。这次会议总结了一九五三年全国的交通工作，研究了目前交通事业的基本情况和今后的基本任务，部署了一九五四年的工作，并以如何推行计划管理和如何对资本主义运输业、个体运输业进行社会主义改造为中心议题，着重进行了讨论。
    一九五三年的交通工作总结说明，交通部门去年完成了国家计划并进行了必要的改革工作。全年直属江、海运输的货运量完成计划百分之一百零八点二；货运周转量完成计划百分之一百零八；运输成本比计划降低百分之四点六；劳动生产率完成计划百分之一百十一点七五；利润和基本折旧预计完成计划百分之一百五十四点五七；沿海大连、天津、青岛、上海、广州五大港口完成吞吐计划百分之一百十三点四二；全国汽车客货运转量完成计划百分之一百十九点一五；全国地方内河货运周转量完成计划百分之一百零七点八四。在基本建设方面，中央投资的公路修建线路，按标准完成的有九百六十公里，初步打通的有七百九十公里，整修的一千零五十八公里，此外完成野外测量七千八百四十六公里，作出设计的六千二百一十公里，改建和新建大桥的测量和设计工作也全部完成。中央投资的航务建设重点项目，已按计划全部完成。沿海、长江私营轮船业经过联合管理或公私合营，已纳入国家计划的轨道，并完成了水上民主改革和民主改革补课工作。地方交通工作一九五三年也有了更好的开展。会议在肯定上述成绩的同时，检讨了工作中的缺点，特别是事故多的重大缺点。
    会议认为，目前交通事业总的基本情况是：运输能力不足，现有设备的潜在能力还没有充分发挥，企业经营管理水平低，技术设备薄弱、落后，蕴藏的天然资源还没有很好利用，大量非社会主义经济成分的存在，干部业务不精和技术人员缺乏等，这些都说明了我国目前交通事业的落后面貌。但是，国家的社会主义工业特别是船舶、汽车制造工业和石油工业的发展，以及其他各种条件，对于今后发展近代化交通事业都将是有利的。今后交通工作的基本任务是：根据国民经济发展的总规划，相应地发展水路运输和公路运输，逐步地有计划有目标地进行技术改造，积极地稳步地有计划地有区别地进行资本主义运输业和个体运输业社会主义改造，以逐步改变我国交通事业的落后面貌，适应工农业生产、商品流通、人民物质文化生活日益增长的运输需要和国防建设的要求，更好地为实现国家过渡时期的总任务和为国家社会主义建设服务。
    目前我国铁路运输负担过重，会议吸取苏联先进经验，认为必须充分利用我国水路运输的天然优良条件，逐步增加内河和沿海运输的比重，以配合铁路完成国家巨大的运输任务，并相当地发展远洋运输。汽车运输在区间短程运输、面的运输上，对于铁路、水路交通不发达区域的运输上，占有很重要的地位，对于农业的社会主义改造和农业生产力的增长，有很重要的作用，因此必须逐步发展公路运输，以配合铁路、水路运输来完成城乡物资交流的任务。
    一九五四年交通部门的任务更加繁重了。根据国家计划，今年直属江、海货运量总计比去年增加百分之三十，货运周转量总计比去年增加百分之三十八，基本建设工作量比去年增加百分之十二。为了保证完成和超额完成一九五四年的计划和各项主要指标，会议认为，必须根据和贯彻这次全国交通会议的精神和既定的方针政策，并在加强责任制的基础上，以切实推行计划管理为中心，确保安全生产，提高效率，保证质量，加强技术管理和财务管理，推广先进经验，发掘潜在能力，进一步提高企业的管理水平，加强对公私合营企业的领导，加强对资本主义运输业和个体运输业的社会主义改造工作。
    会议对于今年的主要工作作了具体部署，并强调指出：必须增强团结和健全集体领导，必须加强思想领导和企业中的政治工作，必须加强钻研业务，学习苏联先进科学技术和先进经验，必须改进领导作风和领导方法，特别要有目的有计划地经常地深入检查，以便切实发现和逐步解决工作中的关键问题。
    这次会议是五月十一日到二十日在北京举行的。参加这次会议的有各大区交通局局长、内蒙古自治区交通部部长、中央人民政府交通部直属海运、河运、航务工程、公路工程各专业管理局局长、公司经理和中央人民政府有关部门的代表等共一百三十六人。
