Newly built and expanded agricultural production cooperatives in the Southwest Region, numbering over 1,400 this past winter and spring, have preliminarily demonstrated the superiority of unified management and collective production through spring plowing, drought prevention, and drought resistance, pointing out the direction forward for the broad masses of farmers.

First, due to the unified management of land by the cooperatives, planting can be carried out according to local conditions, unleashing the potential of the land. This year, with unified land management, it is easier to use new-style farm tools and agricultural machinery, and to promote advanced production techniques, guaranteeing increased production over large areas. Of the more than 1,400 cooperatives in the entire region, about half or more used new-style farm tools such as seven-inch walking plows and double-wheeled single-furrow plows. The vast majority of the more than 150 pumping stations trial-operated throughout the region this year supplied agricultural production cooperatives. Agricultural production cooperatives in various places generally utilize the superior conditions of their own collective management and carry out production according to national needs. According to statistics from nine cooperatives in Jianyang, Sichuan, a total of more than 1,200 mu of cotton were planted this year, an increase of 35.8 percent compared to last year, with plans to increase the yield per unit area by 12 percent, while the planting of corn, sweet potatoes, etc., was reduced by about 30 percent. Ten agricultural production cooperatives in Guiding County, Guizhou, expanded the area of flue-cured tobacco by 140 percent according to national needs. The Xiaoshi Village Vegetable Production Cooperative in the five suburban districts of Chongqing, in order to meet the growing urban demand for vegetables, planned to change the original corn planting land to vegetable planting, an expansion of about 70 percent compared to when it was a mutual aid team.

Cooperatives, because of the concentrated use of manpower and financial resources, are able to carry out larger agricultural basic construction, expand reproduction, and overcome various natural disasters. Statistics from 45 cooperatives in the Jiangjin Special District of Sichuan show that they newly built 100 ponds and reservoirs and repaired 106, ensuring planting even under severe drought conditions and laying the foundation for continued increased production in the future. The Jiahe Production Cooperative in Pingba, Guizhou, repaired a water channel that was more than three li long that they had wanted to build for more than a decade but couldn't, allowing more than 2,400 pickets of fields to be irrigated. The Xingxing Cooperative in Yingjing County, Xikang, and the Qianjin Cooperative in Chuxiong County, Yunnan, and other four cooperatives expanded the cultivated area by 59 mu by opening up wasteland and reversing soil banks, and converted 14 mu of dry land into paddy fields. In drought-stricken Yunnan, agricultural production cooperatives have prominently demonstrated their superiority in the fight against drought. Due to good water conservancy construction and water-drawing for drought resistance, 29 cooperatives in Chuxiong solved the difficulty of transplanting rice seedlings without water.

The superiority of agricultural production cooperatives is also manifested in their ability to help each other and overcome difficulties. The Jiefang Production Cooperative in Jianyang, Sichuan, has more than 20 impoverished households who are widowers, widows, orphans, and lacking labor. The cooperative always pays attention to arranging light tasks such as catching insects, weeding, and drying grain for them to do more of, in order to increase their work points. The cooperative borrowed money to buy 69 pigs and sheep and distributed them to 29 households to raise, helping them establish various household sideline occupations, ensuring that their income increases and gradually freeing them from poverty.

### 西南区新建和扩建的农业生产合作社  在生产抗旱中显示了优越性

    区新建和扩建的农业生产合作社
    在生产抗旱中显示了优越性
    西南区去冬今春新建和扩建的一千四百多个农业生产合作社，通过春耕生产、防旱抗旱，已初步显示了统一经营、集体生产的优越性，给广大农民指出了前进方向。
    首先由于合作社的土地统一经营，可以因地制宜地种植，发挥了土地潜力。今年土地统一经营后，更便于使用新式农具和农业机器，推广先进生产技术，保证大面积增产。全区一千四百多个社，约半数以上使用了七寸步犁，双轮一铧犁等新式农具；全区今年试办的一百五十多处抽水机站，绝大部分都供应农业生产合作社使用。各地农业生产合作社一般都运用了本身集体经营的优越条件，根据国家需要进行生产。据四川简阳九个社的统计，今年共种棉花一千二百多亩，比去年扩大百分之三十五点八，计划提高单位面积产量百分之十二，种植玉米红苕等则缩小了百分之三十左右。贵州贵定县十个农业生产合作社，按国家需要扩大烤烟面积百分之一百四十。重庆市郊五区小石村蔬菜生产合作社，为满足城市对蔬菜日益增长的需要，有计划地把原来种玉米的地改为种菜，约比互助组时扩大百分之七十。
    合作社由于人力、财力集中使用，能够举办较大的农业基本建设，扩大再生产，战胜各种自然灾害。四川江津专区四十五个社统计，新修塘堰一百处，整修一百零六处，在干旱严重的情况下，还能保证栽种，而且给今后继续增产打下了基础。贵州平坝嘉禾生产合作社修好了十几年想修而没修起的三里多长的水沟，使二千四百多挑田有水灌溉。西康荥经县星星、云南楚雄县前进等四社用开荒、倒土坎等办法扩大耕地面积五十九亩，旱地变水田十四亩。在旱灾严重的云南，农业生产合作社在抗旱斗争中突出地显示了优越性。楚雄二十九个社由于水利建设得好，加上车水抗旱，解决了无水栽秧的困难。
    农业生产合作社的优越性还表现在能够互助互济，克服困难。四川简阳解放生产合作社有二十多户鳏、寡、孤、独及缺乏劳动力的贫困户，社内随时注意在捉虫、拔草、翻晒粮食等轻活路上照顾他们多做些，以增加劳动工分；社内贷款买了猪、羊六十九只，分配给二十九户人喂养，帮助他们建立各种家庭副业，保证其收入增加，逐步摆脱贫困。
