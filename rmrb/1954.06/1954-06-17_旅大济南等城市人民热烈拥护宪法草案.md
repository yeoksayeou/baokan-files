People in Dalian, Jinan, and Other Cities Warmly Support the Draft Constitution

The broad masses of workers in Dalian warmly support the draft constitution. Workers call the draft constitution the "law of happiness" and regard its publication as a "great happy event." When newspapers carrying the draft constitution arrived at the factories, workers immediately gathered around and read it collectively. Tang Liyan, a nationally renowned industrial labor model and foreman of the steel casting workshop at the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company, said, "The draft constitution represents the common aspirations of the people of the whole country, and I wholeheartedly support it." Yu Runchuan, a carpenter from the Haikun University construction site of Dalian First Construction Engineering Company, said, "Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, so many factories, schools, and employee dormitories have been built. Today, I have seen the draft constitution, and I have a clearer view of the future of the country and myself, and it has increased my sense of responsibility for building a new country." Workers of the Liu Lifu team at Lushun Factory said: We must conscientiously study the constitution and widely publicize it. We must carry out a technical innovation campaign and improve product quality to support the draft constitution by fulfilling the state plan.

Now the major affairs of the country are to be decided by the people, and I must work harder to run towards socialism." Teachers and students in schools throughout the city are vying to read the newspapers of the day. Associate Professor Wang Jicheng said, "The formulation and discussion process of the draft constitution fully demonstrates the spirit of democracy. The constitution formulated in this way is the real fundamental law of the country and is the crystallization of the common aspirations of the people of the whole country." Street residents, business circles, and ethnic minority residents also warmly support the promulgation of the draft constitution. Ma Fangyu, a resident of Ganshiqiao Street in Jinan, said, "The content stipulated in the draft constitution is really to our liking. In the future, we must act in accordance with the provisions of the constitution." Ma Degui, the Ahong of the Qingzhen Mosque in Libaisi Street, and several Hui people who believe in Islam said after reading the draft constitution: Only in a country led by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party can national equality be enshrined in the constitution, and ethnic minorities can live freely in the big family of the nation.
