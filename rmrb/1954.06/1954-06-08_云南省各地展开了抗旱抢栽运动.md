Yunnan Province's spring plowing production is now entering a full-scale planting phase. Relying on the strength of mutual aid and cooperation, rationally conserving water, and leveraging existing water conservancy potential, various localities are launching a drought resistance and emergency planting campaign.

This year, although Yunnan Province is experiencing severe drought, the broad masses of farmers, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, have fully leveraged the strength of mutual aid and cooperation, constructing and repairing over 261,500 water conservancy projects of various types. Coupled with the proper utilization of existing water conservancy, this can guarantee the transplantation of 60% of the fields. Recently, after entering the planting season, all localities have been paying attention to conserving water. The phenomena of wasting water and manpower in the past have been greatly reduced. For example, Boluojiang Township in Fengyi implemented rotational water distribution, thereby irrigating an additional 800 mu of fields. In the second district of Jianchuan County, Heilong River established a system of dedicated water managers, thereby saving enough water to transplant seedlings in 12,000 mu of paddy fields. Chuxiong, Yiliang, and Qujing prefectures have universally promoted the method of breaking up clods before flooding the fields, which also saves one-third of the water needed for transplanting seedlings. In addition, various localities have also paid attention to leveraging the strength of mutual aid and cooperation in planting, rationally arranging tasks, and coordinating the use of human and animal power. For example, Wang Chengbo and other three mutual aid teams in Niuzhai Township, Yanjin, implemented joint mutual aid to solve the difficulties of human and animal power. Fang Zishan and Fang Fengzhen, two teams in Eshan, joined forces to erect seven waterwheels, working day and night in shifts to draw water, enabling the timely planting of seedlings in 20 mu of Leixiang fields. Xie Guanying in Binchuan County fully utilized animal power, ensuring the smooth progress of planting work.

Thanks to the conservation of water, strengthened specific leadership of mutual aid and cooperation, and attention to coordinating the use of human and animal power, dryland crops in Wenshan, Mianning, Baoshan, Mengzi, and other prefectures have been basically planted. Zhaotong, Yuxi, Yiliang, Qujing, Dali, Chuxiong, Lijiang, and other prefectures have also sown the majority of their crops. Regarding rice, various localities are intensively planting, and it is estimated that most of the areas in Qujing, Yiliang, Chuxiong, and other regions will be able to transplant seedlings on time. The rice in some early rice areas is growing normally and is currently heading and flowering.

    云南省各地展开了抗旱抢栽运动
    云南省的春耕生产工作，现已进入全面的栽种阶段。各地依靠互助合作力量，合理节约用水，发挥现有水利潜力，展开了抗旱抢栽抢种运动。
    今年，云南省虽然干旱严重，但广大农民在党和人民政府的领导下，充分发挥了互助合作的力量，兴修整修多种类型水利达二十六万一千五百多处，加上原有水利运用得当，可以保证百分之六十的田的栽插。最近，各地进入栽插后，都注意节约用水，过去浪费用水、浪费人力的现象已大大减少。如凤仪波箩江乡实行了轮流放水，因而增灌了八百多亩田。剑川县第二区回龙河订出了专人管水制度，因而节约出一万二千亩稻田的栽秧用水。楚雄、宜良、曲靖三个专区普遍推行了先打碎垡子再放水泡田的办法，也节省出三分之一的栽秧用水。此外，各地在栽种中又注意了发挥互助合作的力量，合理安排活计，调剂使用人、畜力的工作。如盐津牛寨乡王成柏等三个互助组实行联组互助以解决人、畜力的困难。蛾山方自善、方凤珍两个组联合起来架了七道水车日夜轮班车水，使二十亩雷响田及时栽上秧。宾川县谢官营充分利用了畜力，使栽种工作顺利进行。
    由于各地节约了用水，加强了对互助合作的具体领导，注意了调剂使用人、畜力的工作，文山、缅宁、保山、蒙自等专区的旱地作物。已基本种完，昭通、玉溪、宜良、曲靖、大理、楚雄、丽江等专区，亦已种下大部，在水稻方面，各地正在紧张栽种，估计曲靖、宜良、楚雄区等地大部分均可按时栽上秧苗。部分早稻地区的水稻生长正常，正在抽穗开花。
