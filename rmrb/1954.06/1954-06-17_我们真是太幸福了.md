    We are Truly Too Happy
    Hu Zhaosen, Model Worker of Anshan City
    I am a young technician at the Anshan Blast Furnace Construction and Installation Engineering Company. I would like to talk about my thoughts after reading the draft constitution.
    The draft constitution states: "Citizens of the People's Republic of China have the right to education. The state establishes and gradually expands various schools and other cultural and educational institutions to ensure that citizens enjoy this right. The state pays special attention to the physical and intellectual development of young people." I have a deep understanding of this point. I remember in 1946 when I applied to the Mechanical Engineering Department of Jiaotong University in Shanghai, there were 7,000 applicants for the Mechanical Engineering Department as their first choice, but the school only admitted 40 people. The announcement of the results was like a death sentence, and I didn't have the courage to look. I didn't get in that time. What to do? I couldn't afford private schools. Later, I finally got into the preparatory class of Jiaotong University, but my younger brother dropped out of school because of this. At that time, my family could only afford to send one child to school. Now, there are very many university places, and the number of children of workers and peasants who can attend middle school is also increasing year by year.
    Before liberation, graduation meant unemployment. Many of my friends encountered such a fate; some even found jobs that were not in their field. I am so lucky that as soon as I graduated, the country treated us students like treasures and sent us to the steel capital of the motherland, asking us to participate in the construction of automated iron-smelting furnaces. When I first arrived at the construction site, everything was very unfamiliar. I knew even less about the latest Soviet-style turbo blowers, only knowing some machine names and general technical theories. I couldn't even name many machine parts, let alone install them. But the organization quickly pointed out the direction for me: learn from the workers; learn from Soviet experts, learn from advanced Soviet experience and implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. Old workers Su Zhongxiao and Ding Chengzhi treated us like their younger brothers, wishing they could teach us everything at once. Everyone signed mutual teaching and learning contracts. When installing the turbo blower and setting the center, I only knew how to calculate and adjust, but I didn't know how to do it specifically. Comrade Ding Chengzhi, on the other hand, only knew how to do it but didn't understand the theory. We worked together and the work went very smoothly.
    With the help and guidance of Soviet experts, we have installed several turbo blowers in the past two years. When some scientists and engineers heard this news, they exclaimed: You are so lucky that the country cares for you so much and gives you so many opportunities for development. No one cared about us in the past! We studied engineering all our lives and still couldn't install automated iron-smelting furnaces. In the past, when foreign firms sold machines, they installed them in advance before delivering them, afraid that the Chinese would learn the technology. You are so lucky.
    Yes, we are truly too happy. The country's care for us young people is truly meticulous, and now it is explicitly stipulated in the draft constitution. In the future, I must study hard and work with the workers to install new turbo blowers so that our country can transition to socialism as soon as possible.

### 我们真是太幸福了

    我们真是太幸福了
    鞍山市劳动模范　胡兆森
    我是鞍山高炉建筑安装工程公司的一个青年技术员。我来谈一谈我看了宪法草案后的感想。
    宪法草案中说：“中华人民共和国公民有受教育的权利。国家设立并且逐步扩大各种学校和其他文化教育机关，以保证公民享受这种权利。国家特别关怀青年的体力和智力的发展。”我对于这一条有深刻的体会。记得一九四六年在上海投考交通大学机械系时，第一志愿考交大机械系的有七千人，而学校只收四十人。发榜就像宣判死刑一样，我没有勇气去看。那一次我没有考上。怎样办呢？私立学校又上不起。后来我总算考上了交通大学先修班，可是我的弟弟却因此失了学。因为那时我家里只能供给一个孩子读书。现在，大学的名额非常多，许多工农的子弟能上中学的也一年比一年增加了。
    解放前毕业就是失业。我有很多朋友就遭遇到了这样的命运；有些即使找到工作，干的也不是本行。我真幸福，一毕业国家就把我们这批学生当作宝贝似的，送到祖国的钢都，叫我们参加自动化炼铁炉的修建工程。初到工地，一切都很生疏，对苏联最新型的透平鼓风机懂得更少，只知道一些机器名称和一般的技术理论，有很多机器零件我连名字也叫不上来，更不要说安装了。但是组织方面很快便给我指出了方向：要向工人学习；向苏联专家学习，学习苏联先进经验和贯彻苏联专家建议。老工人苏忠孝和丁成志把我们当成他们的小弟弟一样，恨不得一下子就教会我们。大家订了互教互学合同。安装透平鼓风机进行到定中心的时候，我只知道如何算，怎样调整，但具体怎样作，我不会。而丁成志同志他只知道作，但不懂理论。我们俩一块儿合作，使工作进行得很顺利。
    在苏联专家的帮助和指导下，两年来我们已经安装了好几台透平鼓风机。一些科学家和工程师听到这个消息时，都感慨地说：你们真太幸福了，国家这样关怀你们，给你们这么多发展机会。我们过去那有人管呀！学了一辈子工程，还不会安自动化炼铁炉。以前，外国洋行卖机器时，都在事先把它安好后交货，生怕中国人把技术学去了。你们真是太幸运了。
    是的，我们真是太幸福了，国家对我们青年关怀得真是无微不至，现在还用宪法草案把它明文规定出来，今后我一定要努力学习，和工人一道把新的透平鼓风机安装起来，使我们的国家早日过渡到社会主义。
