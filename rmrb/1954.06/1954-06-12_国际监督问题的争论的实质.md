The Geneva Conference is discussing the issue of international supervision of the armistice in Indochina. The participants in the conference have agreed in principle that a joint committee composed of both parties to the armistice and an international supervisory commission composed of neutral countries will carry out the task of supervision. However, due to the unreasonable demands of Western countries, particularly the representatives of the United States and France, regarding the composition and scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, this issue has not been resolved quickly.

Based on the experience of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the delegations of China, the Soviet Union, and Vietnam proposed that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission be composed of India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Pakistan. Regarding the issue of the commission's authority and relationship, they maintained that the joint committee should be responsible for supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement, while the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be responsible for monitoring and investigating violations of the armistice agreement. The relationship between these two bodies should be parallel, with a division of labor and mutual association. If the two committees have disagreements that cannot be resolved, the relevant countries participating in the guarantee of the implementation of the armistice agreement can consult and take effective collective measures. These proposals are fair, reasonable, and practical, and they fully reflect the sincere desire of China, the Soviet Union, and Vietnam to safeguard peace in Indochina.

However, the representatives of the United States and other Western countries opposed this reasonable proposal. They put forward various unreasonable demands that disregarded the actual situation. These demands can only show that they do not care about the guarantee of the armistice and intend to create a one-sidedness in international supervision, imposing one party's will on the other. As a result, there is a risk of a one-sided breach of the armistice at any time. For the US delegation, this sinister position is particularly evident.

Whether the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission can effectively carry out its mission is greatly related to whether its members are appropriate. From the beginning, US representative Smith adopted an extremely unreasonable attitude on this issue, even using the reason that "communist countries cannot be neutral" to oppose Poland and Czechoslovakia's participation in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Smith's utterly absurd claim is obviously not worth refuting. If US diplomats determine neutral countries based on ideology or social system, classify communist countries as one side, and deny their neutrality, then there can be no neutral countries among capitalist countries either. In this way, there would be no neutral countries in the world at all. It is well known that international law has a recognized definition of neutral countries. The United States and countries related to the United Nations forces also agreed to the definition of the term "neutral country" in Article 37 of the Korean Armistice Agreement as countries that have not had combat troops participating in hostile acts in Korea. Among the four neutral countries proposed by the Soviet Union to supervise the Indochina armistice in the future, Poland and Czechoslovakia, like India and Pakistan, are suitable for this definition of neutral countries. Poland and Czechoslovakia support a peaceful resolution to the Indochina issue and advocate for the establishment of lasting peace in Indochina. Therefore, it is also undeniable that Poland and Czechoslovakia serve as members of the Indochina Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

In order to find a basis for its unreasonable demands, the United States simply dismissed the role and achievements of the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and carried out crude slanders and smears against the Polish and Czech commissioners. This vile act, as people have already seen, not only does not help the United States, but also backfires.

Since Smith's strange definition of neutral countries is untenable, he changed his tune to talk about the principle of "fairness," attempting to slander peaceful and democratic countries as "unfair." However, since Smith cannot deny that Poland and Czechoslovakia are neutral countries, he cannot erase their impartial stance.

British representative Eden's proposal at the Geneva Conference on June 8 to form a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission composed of five South Asian countries actually opposes the participation of peaceful and democratic countries in supervising the Indochina armistice. If Britain does not dare to agree with the absurd demands of the United States, then there is no reason to cross out Poland and Czechoslovakia from the list of members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

The United States and some other Western countries put forward another reason for opposition, insisting that the Soviet Union, China, and Vietnam's proposal for Poland and Czechoslovakia to participate in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission would have a "hidden veto power." This exposes that they want to turn the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which guarantees the Indochina armistice, into a tool that facilitates them to achieve another purpose, imposing one party's will on the other.

Since the task of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is to truly and objectively supervise whether the two parties that signed the agreement have violated the armistice terms, it requires that the members of this commission are countries that can consider the opinions of both parties and take care of the interests of both parties. At the same time, it must also adopt the principle of unanimous agreement and engage in collective efforts to supervise the armistice. Only in this way can the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission make fair recommendations or mediation opinions that are accepted by both parties, and only in this way can it play its active role well. According to this reasonable principle, it is most appropriate for the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to be composed of India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Pakistan. Because among these four neutral countries, two have diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, one of the warring parties in Indochina, and the other two have diplomatic relations with France, the other warring party. A neutral commission composed in this way is reasonable and meets actual requirements.

As Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out: "We believe that the principle of unanimous agreement is the most just, reasonable, and capable of solving major problems in current international affairs, while the method of majority voting is often used as a tool in major international issues to impose the will of the majority of countries on the side of the minority of countries."

This is an irrefutable argument. Doesn't the current Geneva Conference prove that problems can only be solved through unanimous agreement? The issue of guaranteeing the Indochina armistice in the future is no exception. Since restoring peace in Indochina depends on international consultation, then the international supervisory body dealing with the thorny issue of the Indochina warring parties fulfilling the agreement to cease hostile actions should, of course, conduct consultations everywhere, take care of the interests of both parties, and not rely on unilateral decisions.

The essence of the disagreement on the international supervision issue is precisely because the US ruling clique, which is accustomed to using hegemonic and domineering methods, attempts to make the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission a tool that acts according to the will of the United States. People have already seen that the US ruling clique regards the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission as a thorn in its side, not for any other reason, but because this supervisory body not only failed to become a shield for the United States to arbitrarily violate the Korean Armistice Agreement, but also the Polish and Czechoslovak commissioners justly exposed many facts of the US side violating the agreement. Now, on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, it also shows that the US ruling clique is determined to expand interference in the Indochina War. If it cannot prevent the armistice, it wants to seize handles like the majority voting method of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to undermine the Indochina armistice at any time.

The article entitled "The United States' Plan to Continue the Indochina War" published in the Paris "International Forum" weekly on June 4 exposed this conspiracy of the United States. This article excerpted the important conclusion of the US National Security Council, saying: "The task of the US delegation at the Geneva Conference is to obstruct this solution in every possible way, or on a larger scale, to obstruct any political agreement on the issue of ceasing hostilities in Indochina. If this is not possible, absolutely no agreement should contain any conditions that could hinder, prohibit, or make it difficult to resume hostilities in the future—if one of the Western countries deems it necessary."

If we look again at the claims insisted upon by the United States, France, and some other Western countries regarding the relationship between the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the Joint Committee, and the Nine-Nation Guarantee, we will more clearly discover what their actual intentions are. They claim that the powers of the Joint Committee are only "technical in nature" and should be subject to the "jurisdiction" of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, attempting to prevent the warring parties on the Joint Committee from assuming the important responsibility of supervising the thorough implementation of the armistice agreement. As a result, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission will also be unable to fulfill its responsibilities. Then they claim that if disputes arise between the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Joint Committee that cannot be resolved and are submitted to the relevant guaranteeing countries, the guaranteeing countries (including the United States) may "take action separately." This means that the United States can break the Indochina armistice and restart the war.

As long as the claims made by the US delegation on the issue of supervision of the Indochina armistice are combined, people can see such a picture: The United States is trying to impose one party's will on the other, while at the same time demanding to use such an unreasonable Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to control the Joint Committee composed of the two parties to the armistice; at the same time, on the issue of the nine-nation guarantee, it advocates that actions can be taken separately. This means that the United States should have the freedom to restart the war in Indochina.

From this, it seems that the unreasonable demands insisted upon by the United States and some other Western countries on the issue of international supervision are not feasible. It is dangerous to the future of the Indochina armistice. Therefore, the Geneva Conference should completely resolve the issue of international supervision quickly based on the proposals of the Chinese, Soviet, and Vietnamese delegations. The two different basic positions manifested on this issue are so obvious that it is impossible for the United States and some other Western countries to cover this up and defend their unreasonable demands.

    国际监督问题的争论的实质
    吴全
    日内瓦会议正在讨论对印度支那停战实行国际监督的问题。会议的参加者已原则上同意由停战双方组成联合委员会和由中立国家组成国际监督委员会来执行监督的任务。但是，由于西方国家特别是美国和法国的代表，在中立国监察委员会的成员和职权范围问题方面，坚持无理的主张，以致这个问题未能迅速达成协议。
    中、苏、越三国代表团根据朝鲜停战协定的经验，提出由印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、巴基斯坦四国组成中立国监察委员会；对于这个委员会的职权和关系问题，主张联合委员会应负监督执行停战协定的责任，中立国监察委员会则负责监察和调查违反停战协定的行为，这两个机构的关系应该是平行、分工并相互关联的。如果这两个委员会发生分歧而不得解决时，可由参加保证停战协议实施的有关国家进行协商，并采取有效的集体措施。这些主张是公平合理而切实可行的，它充分反映了中、苏、越三国谋求保障印度支那和平的真诚愿望。
    但美国和其他西方国家的代表反对这个合理建议。他们提出了种种不顾现实情况的无理主张，这些主张只能说明他们不关心停战的保障，并有意造成国际监督的片面性，使一方的意志强加在另一方，其结果随时都可能发生片面破坏停战的危险。对于美国代表团来说，这个心怀叵测的立场，是特别明显的。
    中立国监察委员会是否能够有效地执行任务与它的成员是否适当是有重大关系的。美国代表史密斯一开头就在这个问题上采取极端无理的态度，竟以“共产主义国家不可能是中立的”为理由，来反对波兰和捷克斯洛伐克参加中立国监察委员会。史密斯这种荒谬透顶的主张，显然是不值一驳的。如果按照美国外交家根据思想意识或社会制度来确定中立国，把共产主义国家列为一方，否认它们的中立性，那么资本主义国家中也不可能有中立国。这样世界上就根本没有中立国了。人所共知，国际法对于中立国是有公认的定义的。美国及与联合国军有关的各国也在朝鲜停战协定第三十七款的规定中同意了“中立国”一词的定义为未有战斗部队参加在朝鲜的敌对行为的国家。在苏联提出的将来监督印度支那停战的四个中立国家中，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克，与印度和巴基斯坦一样都是适合于这个中立国的定义的。波、捷两国支持和平解决印度支那问题，主张在印度支那建立持久的和平。因此，波捷两国充任印度支那中立国监察委员会的成员，在这一点上说也是无可非议的。
    美国为了给它的无理主张找寻根据，竟一口抹煞朝鲜中立国监察委员会的作用和成绩，对波、捷委员施行粗暴的诽谤和诬蔑。这种卑劣的行径，正如人们已经看到的，不仅无助于美国，而且使它搬起石头砸了自己的脚。
    史密斯由于他对于中立国所下的奇怪定义站不住脚，又改口来谈什么“公正”的原则，企图诬蔑和平民主国家“不公正”。但是，史密斯既然无法否认波、捷两国是中立国家，也就不能抹煞它们的公正立场。
    英国代表艾登在六月八日的日内瓦会议上提出由南亚五个国家来组成中立国监察委员会的建议，实际上也是反对和平民主国家参加监督印度支那停战的工作。如果英国对于美国的荒谬主张不敢苟同，那就没理由要把波兰和捷克斯洛伐克从中立国监察委员会成员的名单上勾掉。
    美国和其他一些西方国家提出了另一个反对的理由，硬说苏、中、越三国主张波兰和捷克斯洛伐克参加中立国监察委员会就将有“隐藏的否决权”。这就暴露了它们是想把保障印度支那停战的中立国监察委员会，变为便利它们达到另一目的的，以一方意志强加在另一方的工具。
    中立国监察委员会的任务既然是真正客观地监督签订协定双方有无违反停战条款的行为，那就要求这个委员会的成员是能够考虑双方的意见，能够照顾双方的利益的国家；同时，它也必须采取一致协议的原则，从事集体的努力，来监督停战。只有这样，中立国监察委员会才能作出公正的建议或调解意见而为双方所接受，只有这样，它才能很好地发挥它的积极作用。根据这个合理的原则，中立国监察委员会由印、波、捷、巴四国来组成，是最适当不过的。因为这四个中立国家中，有两个和印度支那交战一方的越南民主共和国有外交关系，其他两个和交战另一方的法国有外交关系。这样组成的中立国委员会才是合乎情理、合乎实际要求的。
    正如周恩来外长所指出的：“我们认为一致协议的原则是目前国际事务中最公正、最合理、最能解决重大问题的一种原则，而多数表决的方法，在重大的国际问题上，却常常被利用来作为工具，以图将多数国家一方的意志强加于少数国家的一方。”
    这是不移之论。现在的日内瓦会议不就是证明只有经过一致协议才能解决问题吗？将来保障印度支那停战的问题，也不能例外。既然恢复印度支那的和平要靠国际的协商；那么，国际监督机构处理印度支那交战双方履行协议停止敌对行动的尖锐问题，当然也应该处处进行协商，照顾双方的利益，而不能凭片面的决定。
      国际监察问题上的分歧的实质，正是因为惯常使用称王称霸、唯我独尊的手段的美国统治集团，企图使中立国监察委员会变为顺从美国意志行事的工具。人们已经看到，美国统治集团把朝鲜中立国监察委员会视为眼中钉，就不是为了别的，而是因为这个监察机构不但没有能够成为美国任意破坏朝鲜停战协定的护身符，而且其中的波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员还公正地揭露了美方违反协定的许多事实。现在，在恢复印度支那和平的问题上，也表现出美国统治集团一心要扩大干涉印度支那战争，如果它不能阻止停战，它就想抓住像中立国监察委员会的多数表决方法这样的手柄来随时破坏印度支那停战。
      六月四日出版的巴黎“国际论坛”周刊所刊载的题为“美国继续印度支那战争的计划”的文章，就揭露了美国的这种阴谋。这篇文章摘述了美国国家安全委员会的重要结论说：“美国代表团在日内瓦会议上的任务是千方百计地阻挠这种解决办法，或是在更大的规模上阻挠在停止印度支那敌对行动的问题上达成任何政治协议。如果这样做不可能的话，绝不能使这种协定包含可以妨碍、禁止在将来恢复敌对行动——如果西方国家之一认为有必要的话——或使之发生困难的任何条件。”
      如果我们再来看看美国法国和其他一些西方国家对中立国监察委员会与联合委员会和九国保证之间的关系问题上所坚持的主张，就会更清楚地发见它们的实际意图是什么。他们主张联合委员会的职权只是“技术性质的”，应受中立国监察委员会的“管辖”，企图使联合委员会的交战双方不能负起监督停战协定彻底实施的重大责任，结果也将使中立国监察委员会无法尽到自己的责任。于是它们又主张如果中立国监察委员会和联合委员会发生争议不能解决而提交有关保证各国时，保证国家（其中有美国）得以“各别地采取行动”。这就是说美国可以破坏印度支那的停战，重新爆发战争。
    只要把美国代表团在印度支那停战的监督问题上所持的主张综合在一起，人们就可以看到这样一个图景：美国一边竭力反对按照能够照顾停战双方利益的原则来考虑中立国监察委员会的成员问题，企图把一方意志强加在另一方的身上；一边又要求用这样一个不合理的中立国监察委员会来控制由停战双方所组成的联合委员会；同时，在九国的保证问题上主张可以各别采取行动。这就是说，美国要有在印度支那重新发动战争的自由。
    由此看来，美国和其他一些西方国家在国际监督问题上坚持的无理主张，是不可行的。它对印度支那停战的前途是危险的。因此，日内瓦会议完全应该根据中、苏、越三国代表团的主张，来迅速解决国际监督问题。在这个问题上表现的两个不同的基本立场是那样的明显，美国和其他一些西方国家要想掩盖这一点，替自己的无理主张辩护，是不可能的。
