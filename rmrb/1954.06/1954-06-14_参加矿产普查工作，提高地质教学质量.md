Participating in Mineral Prospecting Work to Improve the Quality of Geological Teaching
Xu Keqin, Head of the Geology Department, Nanjing University

The graduating students and a large number of teachers from geological specialties in various universities and colleges across the country will participate in this year's mineral prospecting work. As a participant in this mineral prospecting, I feel that I shoulder a glorious mission. From the perspective of the teaching and learning needs of teachers and students in the geology departments of universities and colleges, participating in this mineral prospecting work is of even greater significance.

More than a thousand graduating students participating in this mineral prospecting work will receive good practical work training. During the two years of study, students have gained a preliminary foundation in theory and technology, but two years is, after all, relatively short. In terms of linking theory with practice and in terms of field experience in geological work, they have not learned enough. This mineral prospecting work includes both extensive general surveys and detailed geological surveying of mining areas and surface prospecting, which is the most ideal training for newly graduated students. With the efforts of the students and the guidance and help of teachers, engineers, technicians, and workers, these students can complete certain work tasks and can improve rapidly.

This mineral prospecting work is also extremely important for cultivating and improving young teachers in universities and colleges. Since liberation, due to the greatly increased geological teaching tasks, the number of young teachers in various schools has increased significantly. These young teachers have a high level of political awareness and a certain theoretical foundation, and they have shown great enthusiasm and dedication in teaching work and laboratory work. They are also enthusiastically learning Russian and studying Soviet teaching materials. Many young teachers have already taken to the podium. However, the science of geology has extensive content, and field work is closely combined with indoor research work. Many geological phenomena must be observed in the field, materials collected, and analyzed and researched in order to link theory with practice and gradually master this science. Field work is needed throughout the life of geological educators. Young teachers lack training in this area, and this mineral prospecting work is the beginning of further strengthening practical training.

An even more important significance of participating in mineral prospecting work for geological teaching lies in enriching the teaching content and strengthening geological scientific research in universities and colleges. Before liberation, geological scientific research in universities and colleges was very weak, which seriously affected geological education work. After liberation, we have worked hard to improve teaching, learned and adopted advanced Soviet scientific theories, and compiled many suitable Chinese teaching materials. The achievements are certain, but they are still insufficient to meet teaching requirements. In this mineral prospecting, by cooperating with industrial departments to solve practical production problems, we will obtain a lot of practical materials to improve our scientific research work, enrich teaching content, and improve teaching quality.

    参加矿产普查工作，提高地质教学质量
    南京大学地质系主任  徐克勤
    全国各高等学校地质专修科的应届毕业生和很大一部分教师，都将参加今年的矿产普查工作。作为这次矿产普查的参加者，我感到自己担负着光荣的任务。从高等学校地质系师生的教与学的需要来看，参加这次矿产普查工作更有重大意义。
    一千多名毕业学生参加这次矿产普查工作，将得到一个良好的实际工作的锻炼。两年的学习中，同学们在理论和技术方面已有了初步的基础，但是两年的时间毕竟是比较短促的，在理论联系实际方面，在地质工作的野外经验方面，都是学得不够的。这次矿产普查工作既包括广泛的面的普查，也包括详细的矿区地质测量及地表探矿工作，对刚毕业的同学们说来是最理想的训练。靠着同学们的努力，教师、工程师、技术人员和工人的指导、帮助，这些学生们是可以完成一定的工作任务，并且是可以迅速提高的。
    这次矿产普查工作，对培养和提高高等学校青年师资，也是极其重要的。解放以来，由于地质教学任务大大加重，各校青年教师的数量增加很多，这些青年教师都具有较高的政治觉悟和一定的理论基础，在教学工作和实验室的工作中都表现了很高的热情和钻研精神。他们又很热情地学习俄文，钻研苏联教材，其中不少青年教师已经走上讲台。但是地质这门科学内容广泛，野外工作与室内研究工作结合得非常紧密，很多地质现象必须从野外进行实地观察，搜集材料，分析研究，才能使理论联系实际，逐步地掌握这门科学。野外工作对地质教学工作者来说，毕生都是需要的。青年教师们正缺乏这方面的锻炼，这次矿产普查工作是进一步加强实际锻炼的开端。
    参加矿产普查工作，对于地质教学方面更重要的意义，还在于充实教学内容和加强高等学校地质科学研究工作。解放以前，高等学校的地质科学研究工作是十分薄弱的，极其严重地影响地质教育工作。解放以后，我们努力改进教学，学习并采用了苏联先进的科学理论，编写了很多合用的中文教材，成绩是肯定的，但距离教学要求还是不足的。在这次矿产普查中，配合产业部门解决生产实际问题，将会获得很多实际材料，来提高我们的科学研究工作，充实教学内容，提高教学质量。
