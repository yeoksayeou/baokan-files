    Defend the Achievements of the People's Revolution and National Construction
    Striving tirelessly to defend the motherland
    The fifteenth day's newspaper arrived very late. Comrades waited anxiously, speculating: What important thing has happened? When the comrades saw the draft constitution published in the newspaper, everyone scrambled to read it. Finally, one person had to read aloud for everyone to listen, and only then did things quiet down.
    Li Qiyuan, a national combat hero of the artillery, carefully read Article 20 of the General Program of the draft constitution: "The armed forces of the People's Republic of China belong to the people, and their task is to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and to defend the security of the country and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty." He thought: We did this in the past; in the future, we must better accomplish this task.
    He recalled: How difficult it was to achieve this victory! Take his experience, for example. He joined the army at the age of fifteen for the independence and freedom of the motherland. From soldier to battalion commander, he participated in about three hundred large and small battles over sixteen years. During the War of Liberation in 1945, he was transferred to the artillery. At that time, he was completely unfamiliar with artillery tactics and couldn't even clean the cannons properly. However, things you don't know can be learned. He constantly studied and explored how to accurately hit the enemy, and slowly accumulated experience. Finally, the unit became a very good artillery unit. At that time, the artillery company he led participated in the Pinghan Campaign, the Sui-East Campaign, and the Shijiazhuang Campaign. In the battles to attack Taiyuan, Datong, and Dingxian, the cannons were accurate in every shot, effectively coordinating with the infantry operations and annihilating the enemy. Because they fought well, they received six banners of merit and were awarded two major merits. He himself was awarded two war merits and five minor merits. This shows how the people's army grew and strengthened in battle, and also shows that every soldier has contributed to the motherland and the revolutionary cause. Today, he is extremely excited to see that the draft constitution has solidified the fruits of the revolutionary victory. He said: I must work hard to master modern military technology in order to make greater contributions to defending the construction of the motherland. Soon we will graduate, and I will go to the combat post where the motherland needs me, to tirelessly fight to defend the security of the motherland and the construction of the motherland, as the draft constitution requires us to do.
    Defending the Safe Production of Anshan Iron and Steel
    Song Guishuang is a public security soldier. He was extremely happy after seeing the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China.
    In recent years, he has witnessed the rapid development of Anshan Iron and Steel. He recalled that when he first came to Anshan in early 1949, Anshan Iron and Steel was a desolate place, with only a few of the towering chimneys emitting smoke. In recent years, Anshan Iron and Steel has been built so magnificently, with automated factories being built one after another. Workers only need to press a button, and steel pipes, steel rails, and steel materials are automatically rolled out one after another. From the development of Anshan Iron and Steel, we can see the rapid development of national construction. Thinking of this, he increased his confidence and strength. He said: "The motherland has entrusted us with the important responsibility of defending Anshan Iron and Steel! That is not only our honor, but also our pride. Article 20 of the draft constitution states:
  'The armed forces of the People's Republic of China belong to the people, and their task is to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and to defend the security of the country and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty.' I am a public security soldier defending Anshan Iron and Steel. I will support the draft constitution with practical actions, strengthen political and military study, raise vigilance, strictly prevent all sabotage activities of the enemy, defend the safe production of Anshan Iron and Steel, and strive to accelerate the socialist construction of the country!"
    Double Joy
    On June 15th, the soldiers of a certain company of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lushun and Dalian were in high spirits and full of joy. On this day, this company encountered two happy events in succession. One was the publication of the draft constitution; the other was the receipt of gifts from the people of the whole country to慰问the People's Liberation Army.
    Shortly after six o'clock in the morning, after the platoon of soldiers had breakfast, they were exercising on the playground when they suddenly heard the duty officer Li Tingpu shouting: "Come and listen to the good news! The draft constitution has been published!" They swarmed into the barracks. The barracks were full of people. Some soldiers, finding no place to sit, simply sat on the floor. The radio transmitted a clear and loud voice. The announcer steadily read the draft constitution item by item. The soldiers listened attentively, afraid of missing a word.
    After listening to the broadcast, the soldiers impatiently waited to see the day's newspaper. Soldier Su Qingmao ran to the communications room four times and finally got the newspaper. Wang Chongjiu, the study group leader of the third squad, took the day's newspaper and was immediately surrounded by the soldiers. He loudly recited, and when he read Article 20 of the draft constitution, "The armed forces of the People's Republic of China belong to the people...", the soldiers asked him to read this article again. He had to satisfy everyone's request and reread this article word by word.
  At dinner time, the慰问gifts from the people of the motherland were distributed to each soldier. Pictures of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, commemorative medals, fountain pens, manuals, and teacups, each item represented the wishes of the people of the motherland.
    The soldiers were inspired by these two events. They couldn't help but think about these two events while working, resting, eating, and walking. Li Guangyi, a third-class merit recipient, recorded the two happy events that happened that day in the notebook given to him by the people of the motherland. He said: "The draft constitution stipulates the tasks of our people's army. I am a soldier of the people, receiving such love from the people, I must study hard, rapidly improve my political, military, and cultural level, and defend our great motherland!"
    Years of Aspirations Realized
    After seeing the draft constitution, the commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tianjin were most deeply moved by the opening words of the preface: "After more than a hundred years of heroic struggle, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, finally achieved the great victory of the people's revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in 1949, thus ending a long period of oppression and enslavement..." Chen Ming, who joined the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army twenty-four years ago, said: "We participated in the revolution, shed blood, and sacrificed ourselves in order to eliminate the people's suffering on our land." Twenty years ago, holding this great aspiration, he climbed over snow-capped mountains, walked across grasslands, and participated in the 25,000-li Long March. In 1935, he led a company of Red Army soldiers, defeated a regiment of Kuomintang bandit troops, and recovered Yinjiang County, the base area in Guizhou. In the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, he made outstanding contributions. Every chapter and article of the draft constitution reminded the heroes of the arduous struggle of those years of fighting in the north and south. Zheng Suchun, a famous first-class people's hero who attended the National Congress of Combat Heroes, recalled leading a platoon of soldiers to forcibly attack Motianling of Mount Tai and the Battle of Huaihai. Today, seeing that the draft constitution has solidified the victory achieved by the Chinese people's bloody struggle, they all excitedly said: It writes down our determination and willingness to defend socialist construction. We warmly welcome it and will also work hard to study it.
    Strengthened the Sense of Responsibility for Defending State Property
    The guards of the East Suburb Warehouse in Tianjin, wearing the badges of "Chinese People's Economic Police," vigilantly guard the nation's materials day and night. This is a model guard squad. On the morning of the 15th, the news of the publication of the draft constitution reached here, and everyone enthusiastically launched study and discussion. They talked about their own work from the draft constitution. Squad leader Liu Yuhua said: "The draft constitution stipulates that 'The public property of the People's Republic of China is sacred and inviolable. It is the duty of every citizen to cherish and protect public property.' Our responsibility for guard work is even greater. We must be a hundred times more vigilant and protect state property well." Peng Zhenyao said: "The better we build, the more unwilling the enemy will be, and they will come to sabotage. I am a Communist Party member, and I must unite and motivate the masses, overcome complacency and the idea of peace, and do a good job in guard work." Zhang Huide, a nineteen-year-old who only started working in the second half of last year, thought: It is our responsibility to protect these materials. If we are a little careless, we may waste tens of billions or hundreds of billions of yuan. After the publication of the draft constitution, he further strengthened his sense of responsibility for defending state property.

### 保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果

    保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果
    为保卫祖国而不懈地奋斗
    十五日的报纸到的很晚，同志们焦急地等待着，揣测着：有什么重要事情发生了？当同志们看到报纸上登了宪法草案时，大家争相阅读，最后只得一人读大家听，这样才安静下来。
    全国炮兵战斗英雄李启元仔细地阅读着宪法草案总纲中的第二十条：“中华人民共和国的武装力量属于人民，它的任务是保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的安全和领土主权的完整。”他想：过去，我们这样作了；今后，我们要更好地完成这一任务。
    他回忆到：能够取得这种胜利，该是多么不容易啊！就拿他的经历来说吧，为了祖国的独立和自由，他十五岁就参军了，从战士到营长，十六年来参加了约三百多次的大小战斗。在一九四五年解放战争期间，他曾被调到炮兵部队去，那时他对炮兵战术完全外行，连擦炮都擦不好。但是，不会的东西是可以学会的，他不断地钻研着，摸索着怎样才能打准敌人，慢慢地积累着经验。最后部队终于成为一支很好的炮兵部队。那时他领导的炮兵连，参加了平汉战役、绥东战役、石家庄战役。在攻打太原、大同、定县等战斗中，大炮都是百发百中，有力地配合了步兵作战，歼灭了敌人。因为打得好，曾获得了六面锦旗，立了两次大功，他本人也立了二次战功和五次小功。从这里可以看出人民军队如何在战斗中成长壮大起来，也说明每一个战士都为祖国、为革命事业作出了贡献。今天他看到宪法草案已经把革命胜利果实固定下来，心里感到极大的兴奋。他表示：我一定要努力掌握现代化的军事技术，以便在保卫祖国建设事业中作更大贡献。不久我们就要毕业了，我将到祖国需要我去的战斗岗位上去，为保卫祖国的安全，保卫祖国的建设，而不懈地奋斗，像宪法草案中所要求我们的一样。
    保卫鞍钢安全生产
    宋贵双是一个公安战士。他看到中华人民共和国宪法草案以后，高兴极啦。
    在这几年中，他亲眼看到鞍钢的迅速发展。他回忆起一九四九年初来鞍山的时候，鞍钢是一片荒凉，林立的烟囱只有几个冒烟的。几年来，鞍钢已建设得这样雄伟壮丽，自动化的工厂一座座建设起来，工人只要一按电钮，那钢管、钢轨、钢材就自动地一根接一根地轧制出来。从鞍钢的发展，就可以看出全国建设突飞猛进的发展情况。他想到这里，就增加了信心和力量。他说：“祖国交给我们保卫鞍钢的责任是多么重大啊！那不仅是我们的光荣，也是我们的骄傲。宪法草案第二十条写着：
  ‘中华人民共和国的武装力量属于人民，它的任务是保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的安全和领土主权的完整。’我是保卫鞍钢的公安战士，我要以实际行动来拥护宪法草案，加强政治与军事学习，提高警惕，严防敌人的一切破坏活动，保卫鞍钢安全生产，为加速国家社会主义建设而奋斗！”
    喜上加喜
    六月十五日，中国人民解放军驻旅大部队某连战士们兴高采烈，喜气洋洋。在这一天内，这个连队接连遇见两件喜事。一件是宪法草案公布；另一件是收到了全国人民慰问人民解放军的慰问品。
    早晨六点多钟，一排战士们吃过早饭不久，正在操场上运动的时候，忽然听见值班员李廷朴喊道：“快来听好消息啊！宪法草案公布啦！”他们就一下拥进了营房。营房里坐满了人，有的战士看无处可坐，索性坐在地板上。无线电传来了清晰宏亮的声音。广播员稳重地逐条宣读着宪法草案。战士们聚精会神地听着，唯恐漏掉一句。
    战士们听了广播以后，就急不可耐地等着看当天的报纸。战士苏庆茂到传达室跑了四趟，好容易把报纸拿来了。三班的学习组长王崇九拿到当天的报纸，马上被战士们包围起来。他大声地朗诵着，当他读到宪法草案第二十条“中华人民共和国的武装力量属于人民……”时，战士们要求他把这一条再念一遍。他只好满足大家的要求，又把这一条逐字逐句地重读了一遍。
  在吃晚饭的时候，祖国人民给的慰问品分发到每个战士的手中了。毛主席和朱总司令的像片、纪念章、自来水笔、手册、茶杯，每件东西都代表了祖国人民的心意。
    战士们被这两件事鼓舞着。他们在工作、休息、吃饭、走路时，都不能不想这两件事。三等功功臣李广义把这天发生的两件喜事记在祖国人民赠送给他的笔记本上。他说：“宪法草案规定了我们人民军队的任务。我是一个人民的战士，受着人民这样的爱戴，我一定好好学习，迅速提高政治、军事、文化水平，保卫我们伟大的祖国！”
    多少年的愿望实现了
    解放军驻津某部指战员们看到宪法草案以后，感触最深的，是序言中开头的几句话：“中国人民经过一百多年的英勇奋斗，终于在中国共产党领导下，在一九四九年取得了反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的人民革命的伟大胜利，因而结束了长时期被压迫、被奴役的历史……。”二十四年前就参加工农红军的陈明说：“我们参加革命，流血牺牲，就是为了在我国土地上消除人民的灾难。”他在二十年前抱着这一伟大的愿望，爬过雪山，走过草地，参加了二万五千里长征。一九三五年他率领一连红军，击垮一团国民党匪军，收复了贵州根据地印江县。在抗日战争和人民解放战争中，他立过卓越的功绩。宪法草案的每章每条，都使英雄们忆起当年南征北战艰苦奋斗的情景。曾出席过全国战斗英雄代表会议的著名一级人民英雄郑素春，想起了过去率领一班战士强攻泰山摩天岭和淮海战役的战斗。今天，他们看到宪法草案把中国人民流血搏斗所取得的胜利固定了下来，都兴奋地说：它写下了我们保卫社会主义建设的决心和意愿，我们热烈欢迎它，并且还要努力学习它。
    加强了保卫国家资财的责任心
    天津市东郊仓库，佩带着“中国人民经济警察”胸章的警卫人员，日夜警惕地守卫着国家的物资。这是一个模范的警卫班。十五日上午，宪法草案公布的消息传到了这里，大家热烈地展开学习讨论。他们从宪法草案谈到了本职工作。班长刘玉华说：“宪法草案里规定‘中华人民共和国的公共财产神圣不可侵犯。爱护和保卫公共财产是每一个公民的义务。’咱们作警卫工作的责任更大了。咱们一定要百倍地警惕，保卫好国家财产。”彭振尧说：“我们建设得愈好，敌人就会愈不甘心，要来破坏。我是
  一个共产党员，一定要团结和带动群众，克服麻痹思想和太平观念，把警卫工作做好。”去年下半年才参加工作的十九岁的张惠德想：保护这些物资是我们的责任，如果稍一疏忽大意，可能就要糟蹋几十亿几百亿元。宪法草案公布以后，他更加强了保卫国家资财的责任心。
