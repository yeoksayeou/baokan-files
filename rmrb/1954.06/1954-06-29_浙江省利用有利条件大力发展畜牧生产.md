Zhejiang Province will fully utilize its favorable conditions to vigorously develop animal husbandry production. In terms of resolving the feed problem, the province can utilize 7.4 million mu of winter fallow land, and the triple-cropping areas have approximately 4.8 million mu of idle land in summer and autumn, all of which can be used to cultivate feed crops. Succulent and green fodder are available year-round in various regions, and the province has over 70 million mu of barren mountains suitable for grazing. If the idle land is fully utilized to plant various feed crops, it is estimated that the feed will not only be sufficient but also have a surplus. The potential for developing animal husbandry production in the province is also substantial. For example, each household in the Jinhua Special District raises an average of 0.98 pigs, and one pig is raised for every 5.1 mu of land, while other regions are all below this level. Furthermore, in terms of cattle breeding, the reproduction rate was only about 10% in the past due to a lack of attention to selection and breeding work. If the masses are mobilized to pay attention to selection and breeding work in the future, the reproduction rate can be increased, and more than 300,000 calves can be added each year.

Based on these circumstances, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government has formulated a plan to increase the number of cattle and pigs this year. It is required to increase the number of draught cattle by 10% and breed 100,880 calves; increase the number of pigs by more than 20%, from 3.31 million last year to 4 million. It is required that all regions rely on mutual aid and cooperative organizations to develop animal husbandry production in order to solve the feed problem, rationally use labor, solve the difficulty of buying pigs, increase the number of pigs raised, improve feeding management, and improve quality. It has also been decided to carry out mass activities throughout the province to improve feeding management and selection and breeding work. The state-owned Jinhua Pig Farm and ten local state-owned breeding stations in Tiantai and other places will vigorously carry out breeding work, supply farmers with a large number of excellent breeding pigs, and actively expand the supply area of ​​hybrid pigs. All regions will systematically use state-owned farms as a base point to breed cattle and pigs for the masses; in addition, they will strengthen the leadership of private breeding households, give play to their enthusiasm, and require agricultural production cooperatives to gradually兼作 breeding work.

### 浙江省利用有利条件大力发展畜牧生产

    浙江省利用有利条件大力发展畜牧生产
    浙江省将充分利用有利条件，大力发展畜牧业生产。该省在解决饲料问题方面，可以利用的冬闲田有七百四十万亩，三熟制地区夏、秋季还约有四百八十万亩休闲地，这些土地都可以栽培饲料作物。各地多汁饲料、青饲料一年四季都有，全省并有可以放牧的荒山七千多万亩。如能充分利用休闲田种植各种饲料作物，估计饲料不仅够用，而且还有剩余。该省发展畜牧业生产的潜在力也很大。如金华专区每户平均养猪○·九八头，每五亩一分地养猪一头，而其他地区则都低于这个水平，又如耕牛的繁殖方面，过去因为不注意选种配种工作，繁殖率只有百分之十左右，今后如果发动群众注意选种配种工作，繁殖率就可以提高，每年可以增殖小牛三十万头以上。
    根据这些情况，浙江省人民政府已订出今年增殖牛、猪的计划。要求增殖耕牛百分之十，繁殖小牛十万零八千八百头；增殖毛猪百分之二十以上，由去年三百三十一万头增殖到四百万头。要求各地依靠互助合作组织来发展畜牧业生产，以便解决饲料问题，合理使用劳动力和解决买猪资金困难，增加养猪数量，改善饲养管理，提高质量。并决定在全省开展群众性的改善饲养管理和选种配种工作，国营金华猪场和天台等十个地方国营配种站将大力开展配种工作，供应农民大批优良种猪，并积极扩大杂交猪供应地区。各地将有计划地以国营农场为基点给群众的耕牛和猪配种；此外还要加强对民营配种户的领导，发挥他们的积极性，并要求农业生产合作社逐步地兼作配种工作。
