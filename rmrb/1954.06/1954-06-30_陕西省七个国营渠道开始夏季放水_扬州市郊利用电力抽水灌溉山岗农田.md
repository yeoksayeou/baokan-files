    Seven State-Owned Channels in Shaanxi Province Begin Summer Water Release
    Yangzhou Suburbs Use Electricity to Pump Water to Irrigate Upland Farmland
    The Jinghui and Luohui, the two major state-owned channels in Shaanxi Province, began releasing water for summer irrigation in mid-June. In addition to irrigating all cotton fields this summer, the two channels are expected to irrigate more than 244,000 mu of autumn crops. The Hanhui, Baohui, Xuhui, Lenghui, and Danghui state-owned channels began releasing water in late May for summer irrigation of rice paddies. By early June, they had irrigated more than 370,000 mu of land, completing 98% of the planned irrigation tasks before rice transplanting in the irrigation area. In the areas where water has been released, farmers are now combining summer harvesting and threshing with cotton field management to rush to plant late autumn crops.
    Before the start of summer irrigation, the management departments of each channel inspected and repaired the channels, convened meetings to prepare for summer irrigation, formulated water distribution plans, dispatched full-time cadres, and settled water fees. In order to improve irrigation efficiency, water users in villages within the Hanhui Canal irrigation area organized more than 100 irrigation teams, with 549 people participating. After the start of summer irrigation, many leading comrades from the special district and county Party and government leading organs and the canal management bureaus personally went deep into the irrigation areas to inspect and supervise. Each channel implemented division by area and section, established a responsibility system, and launched competitions. The masses also displayed the spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity. Many areas have organized the adjustment of cattle to solve the difficulty of insufficient animal power for plowing and releasing water in some areas.

    The expansion project of the Slender West Lake electric irrigation station in the suburbs of Yangzhou City, Jiangsu Province, was successfully completed in early June. The expansion of this project not only tripled the irrigation area compared to the original, but also allowed lake water to be pumped up the hills to irrigate farmland in the mountains, relieving the drought threat that has plagued upland farmers for generations.
    This area has always been threatened by drought, with an average annual yield of only one hundred jin of rice per mu. In the event of drought, the entire crop would be lost. In 1952, Wang Deshan, a farmer in Pingshan Village, planted his crops four times, spending more than 300,000 yuan on seed costs, but only harvested 500 jin of sweet potatoes, worth about 50,000 yuan. Last year, after the People's Government trial-operated an electric irrigation station here, rice production increased by more than two times compared to normal years. When the news that the irrigation project would be expanded to pump water up the mountain this year spread, the farmers automatically organized to dig drainage ditches and water delivery channels in order to expand the irrigation area. In early June, the entire expansion project was completed. The irrigation area after the expansion has reached more than 3,500 mu, which can increase grain production by about one million jin per year. In the future, it will be gradually expanded so that all of the more than 20,000 mu of rice paddies in the hilly area will be irrigated by electricity. (Cheng Jie)

    陕西省七个国营渠道开始夏季放水
    扬州市郊利用电力抽水灌溉山岗农田
    陕西省泾惠、洛惠两大国营渠道，已于六月中旬开始夏灌放水。该两渠今年夏季除灌溉全部棉田外，并预计灌溉秋田二十四万四千多亩。汉惠、褒惠、湑惠、冷惠、灙惠等五个国营渠道，由五月下旬开始放水进行稻田夏灌，至六月上旬，即已灌田三十七万多亩，完成了灌区插秧前计划灌溉任务的百分之九十八。已放过水的地区，农民现正结合夏收碾场和棉花田间管理工作，进行抢种晚秋。
    夏灌开始前，各渠道管理部门都检查、补修了渠道，召开了夏灌准备工作会议，并都作了配水计划，抽调了专职干部，清算了水费。为了提高灌溉效率，汉惠渠灌区各村用水户组织了一百多个灌溉小组，参加的达五百四十九人。夏灌开始后，专、县党、政领导机关及各渠道管理局的不少负责同志都亲自深入灌区检查督导；各渠道实行了划片分段，建立了责任制，开展了竞赛；群众也都发挥了互助友爱精神，不少地区有组织地调剂了耕牛，解决了部分地区犁地放水时畜力不足的困难。

    江苏省扬州市郊瘦西湖电力灌溉站的扩建工程，已在六月上旬胜利完工。这一工程的扩大，不仅使灌溉面积比原来增加了三倍，而且可把湖水抽上山岗灌溉山间农田，解除了山岗农民世世代代所苦恼的旱灾威胁。
    这一带地区一向遭受旱灾威胁，常年平均产量每亩只有百十斤稻谷，一遇干旱，便全部失收。一九五二年平山村农民王德山的庄稼种了四次，种籽费用就花了三十多万元，结果只收了五百斤山芋，约值五万元。去年，人民政府在这里试办了电力灌溉站后，水稻产量比常年产量增加两倍以上。当今年决定扩大灌溉工程抽水上山的消息传出后，农民都自动组织起来，开挖排水沟和送水渠，以便扩大灌溉面积。六月上旬，扩建工程全部完工，工程扩大后的灌溉面积已有三千五百多亩，每年约可增产粮食一百万斤。将来还要逐渐扩大，使二万多亩丘陵地带的水稻田，全部用电力灌溉。（成捷）
