    People's Congresses of Various Districts in Beijing Commence Meetings, All Treating Discussion of the Draft Constitution as an Important Agenda Item
    The first sessions of the first People's Congresses of various districts in Beijing began successively on the 16th. The People's Congresses of Shijingshan, Fengtai, and Nanyuan districts opened on the 16th, and the People's Congresses of the other ten districts will be held successively from the 17th to the 22nd.
    The district People's Congress meetings that have been held and will be held all regard the discussion of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China as an important agenda item. There will be enthusiastic discussions on the Draft Constitution at the meetings, and necessary resolutions will be made. In order to enable the district People's Congress meetings to conduct in-depth discussions on the Draft Constitution, Zhang Youyu, Director of the Beijing Municipal Constitution Draft Discussion Committee, will make a report on the Draft Constitution to the people's representatives of all districts in the city (except Jingxi Mining Area) on the 17th. In addition, at this meeting, the People's Congresses of various districts will also elect representatives to the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, review the government work reports, listen to the reports of the district election committees on the grassroots election work, and review and handle the proposals submitted by the representatives.
    A total of 2,118 district people's representatives were elected in the grassroots elections in Beijing. Since the end of the election, the representatives have maintained close contact with their voters and have truly played the role of people's representatives. Auntie Tian, a people's representative from Xidan District, has become the most beloved person among the residents of the Wei Ying Hutong police station jurisdiction where she is located, and the masses go to her when they have problems; during the study of the General Line, she led more than 100 street women to carry out discussions and studies, and the results were very good. The representatives also often pay attention to collecting the opinions of the people and put forward positive suggestions and improvement opinions on the work of the government. Steel workers Yang Kui, An Kun, Xu Shufang and other people's representatives from Shijingshan District actively collected proposals from voters before this conference. The Xuanwu District People's Government has held special meetings to study how to strengthen the connection between representatives and voters. (Xinhua News Agency)

    北京各区人民代表大会陆续开始举行会议
    都把讨论宪法草案作为重要的议程之一
    北京市各区第一届第一次人民代表大会会议从十六日起陆续开始举行。石景山、丰台、南苑等三个区人民代表大会会议已在十六日开幕，其他十个区的人民代表大会会议也将在十七日到二十二日先后举行。
    已经举行和将要举行的区人民代表大会会议，都把讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案作为重要的议程之一。会上将对宪法草案进行热烈的讨论，并作出必要的决议。为了使各区人民代表大会会议对宪法草案进行深入的讨论，北京市宪法草案讨论委员会主任张友渔将在十七日向全市各区人民代表（京西矿区除外）作关于宪法草案的报告。另外，各区人民代表大会在这次召开的会议上还将选举北京市人民代表大会代表，审查政府工作的报告，听取区选举委员会关于基层选举工作的报告，并对代表们提出的提案进行审查和处理。
    北京市基层选举中共选出区人民代表两千一百一十八名。在选举结束以来，代表们和自己的选民保持着密切的联系，真正起了人民代表的作用。西单区人民代表田大妈已成为她所在的未英胡同派出所辖区居民中最受爱戴的人，群众有事就去找她；学习总路线期间，她曾领导一百多个街道妇女进行讨论学习，成绩很好。代表们还经常注意搜集人民群众的意见，对政府工作提出积极的建议和改进意见。石景山区人民代表钢铁工人杨奎、安崑、许淑芳等，在这次大会前都积极在选民中搜集提案。宣武区人民政府曾召开过专门会议，研究如何加强代表与选民间的联系问题。　（新华社）
