The following article discusses the utilization of rural surplus labor for agricultural infrastructure construction undertaken by farmers in Xigou and ten other townships in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province.

    [This newspaper reports] The farmers in Xigou and ten other townships in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, are organizing the surplus rural labor force to carry out agricultural infrastructure construction.

    Townships such as Xigou, Chuandi, and Yangjingdi have, in conjunction with spring plowing production, systematically drawn out surplus labor to carry out agricultural infrastructure construction work such as repairing river flats to create new land and opening mountain gullies, achieving great results. In order to summarize and promote this experience in a timely manner, the Pingshun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Pingshun County People's Government convened a meeting of party branch secretaries and township heads from ten townships, including Xigou, Chuandi, Yangjingdi, Chengguan, Wangzhuang, and Yanggao, in mid-May. The meeting focused on studying the direction of development in mountainous areas. After discussion, it was decided to organize all surplus labor to carry out agricultural infrastructure construction in the ten townships, based on the principle of "less expenditure, greater benefit." The twenty-one agricultural cooperatives in the ten townships led all mutual aid teams and individual farmers in drawing out 1,080 surplus laborers, who spent over 86,000 labor days on construction work. This year, the plan is to repair over 1,600 mu of river flats to create new land, of which over 380 mu will be planted with wheat in the same year; to build six dams, which can maintain over 500 mu of old and new land; and to build over 340 mu of terraced fields, of which 210 mu will be planted in the same year. Including methods such as controlling mountain gullies and building embankments, a total of over 2,500 mu of fields have been repaired, with over 640 mu to be planted in the same year. Calculated at 200 jin of grain per mu, the newly repaired fields can increase grain production by over 120,000 jin. This work has started successively in late May. The 200 surplus laborers drawn from Yanggao Township completed 65 mu of terraced fields in four days.

    利用农村剩余劳动力进行农业基本建设
    【本报讯】山西省平顺县组织西沟等十个乡农民，利用农村剩余劳动力进行农业基本建设。
    西沟、川底、羊井底等乡，结合春耕生产工作有计划地抽出剩余劳动力，进行修滩漫地、开山沟等农业基本建设工作，做出了很大成绩。中共平顺县委和平顺县人民政府为了及时总结推广这一经验，在五月中旬召开了西沟、川底、羊井底、城关、王庄、阳高等十个乡的党支部书记、乡长会议，重点研究了山区发展方向，经讨论后，决定在十个乡内本着“花钱少、收益大”的原则，组织所有剩余劳动力进行农业基本建设。十个乡的二十一个农业社带动所有互助组和个体农民，抽出剩余劳力一千零八十人，以八万六千多个劳动日从事建设工作。今年计划修滩地一千六百多亩，其中当年下种小麦三百八十多亩；修坝六道，可保持新旧地五百余亩；修梯田三百四十多亩，当年下种二百一十亩；连闸山沟、垒岸等办法在内，共修成田二千五百多亩，当年下种六百四十多亩，以每亩产粮二百斤计算，新修田就可增产十二万多斤粮食。这一工作已在五月下旬先后开工，阳高乡抽出的二百个剩余劳力，四天内就修成梯田六十五亩。
