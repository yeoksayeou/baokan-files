(Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 5th) The state-owned Shenyang Wire Rod Factory, learning from the experience of the Soviet Stalin Automobile Factory in reducing costs, has significantly lowered the cost of its main products by 5.4 to 15.6 percent in the past four months, and has turned over more than 12 billion yuan in profits to the state, exceeding the national plan.

The main experience of the Stalin Automobile Factory in reducing costs is to organize and mobilize all employees to fight for cost reduction, and to establish specialized cost reduction agencies, formulate methods for calculating achievements, and promptly commend and reward units and individuals who have achieved results. The Shenyang Wire Rod Factory's study of this experience began in February of this year during discussions of the national plan. On the one hand, the planning department, in response to the shortcomings in various aspects last year, proposed a detailed savings plan. The factory director also, in accordance with the spirit of thrift, promulgated new job responsibilities for various departments and methods for commending and rewarding advanced workers in cost reduction. On the other hand, the factory's CCP organization and trade union organized ideological education on the economic accounting system for all workers and staff, so that the work of reducing costs quickly gained the enthusiastic support of the masses of employees. During the half-month of discussing the national plan, employees put forward 151 rationalization proposals, most of which, and more importantly, have now been implemented. The technical department's proposal to establish a waste product recycling system could save the country the equivalent of 2.4 billion yuan in wealth per year. The equipment and power department's proposal to establish a group contracting system to improve equipment utilization could also increase production equivalent to 15.5 billion yuan in wealth per year. The renovation of the workshop in the first workshop was originally scheduled to halt production for fifteen days. Because workers and technicians devised a way to build a layer of wooden scaffolding under the old roof to block bricks, mud, and rainwater, the production of the first workshop continued as usual, creating more than 10 billion yuan in value for the country. Many employees also suggested reducing costs by directly increasing production. One proposal to rebuild the heating furnace, which would cost just over 150 million yuan to complete, could increase production by 1,500 tons of steel per year, which is roughly equivalent to 9 billion yuan. The masses of workers have also made achievements in saving raw materials. The wire rod used to produce one ton of iron wire in the wire drawing section has been reduced by 40 kilograms compared to the past, saving 3.2 billion yuan annually. In the past four months, 26 advanced workers in cost reduction throughout the factory have received rewards and commendations. In order to reduce costs, workers and staff also frequently engage in criticism and self-criticism. Some time ago, the first workshop asked the supply and marketing department to buy gear oil, but they bought cylinder oil instead. The workers in the first workshop criticized this and refused to use it, because although this type of oil was also usable, it was 19,000 yuan more expensive per kilogram than the gear oil they originally wanted.

### 学习苏联斯大林汽车工厂的经验  沈阳线材厂主要产品的成本显著降低

    学习苏联斯大林汽车工厂的经验
    沈阳线材厂主要产品的成本显著降低
    据新华社沈阳五日电：国营沈阳线材厂学习苏联斯大林汽车工厂降低成本的经验，近四个月来，主要产品的成本已降低了百分之五点四到十五点六，上缴利润超过国家计划一百二十多亿元。
    斯大林汽车工厂降低成本的经验，主要是组织和发动全体职工为降低成本而斗争，并且设立降低成本的专门机构，制订计算成绩的办法，及时表扬和奖励有成绩的单位和个人。沈阳线材厂学习这一经验是从今年二月间讨论国家计划时开始的。他们一方面由计划科针对去年各方面的缺点提出了一个详细的节约方案，厂长也根据节约的精神，颁布了各科室新的工作职责和表扬奖励降低成本先进工作者的办法；另方面，由厂里中共党组织和工会组织向全体工人职员进行经济核算制的思想教育，因而降低成本的工作很快就得到了职工群众的热烈支持。在半个多月讨论国家计划的时间里，职工们提出了一百五十一项合理化建议，其中比较重要的，现在大部分都已经实现。技术科提出来的建立废品回收制度，一年就可为国家节约相当于二十四亿元的财富。设备动力科提出的建立小组包修制提高设备运用率的建议，一年也可以多增产相当于一百五十五亿元的财富。改建第一车间的厂房，原来准备停止生产十五天。由于工人和技术人员们设法在旧屋顶下面搭上一层木板的架子，挡住砖泥和雨水，使得一车间的生产照常进行，为国家多创造了一百多亿元的价值。还有许多职工建议以直接增加生产来降低成本。有一项改建加热炉的建议，只要一亿五千多万元就可以改建成功，它一年内就可以增产一千五百吨钢材，大约相当于九十亿元。工人群众在节省原材料方面也已获得成绩，仅伸线工段生产一吨铁丝所用的线材就比过去减少了四十公斤，全年可节约三十二亿元。在四个月中，全厂已有二十六位降低成本的先进工作者获得了奖励和表扬。为了降低成本，工人和职员们还经常地展开批评和自我批评。前些日子，第一车间要供销科买齿轮油，可是买来了气缸油，一车间的工人就提出批评，拒绝使用。因为这种油虽然也好用，可是比他们原来要的齿轮油每公斤贵了一万九千元。
