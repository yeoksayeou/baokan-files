Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 5th: The Geneva Conference held its thirteenth plenary session on the Korean issue on the 5th. The chairman was Prince Wan Waithayakon of Thailand.

    The outstanding feature of the 5th session was that the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union fully demonstrated their sincere desire to seek an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in a spirit of consultation and reconciliation. At the 5th session, Foreign Minister Nam Il hoped that the Geneva Conference could reach an agreement based on the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the supplementary proposals of the People's Republic of China; Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out that there was a common basis for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and hoped that the representatives of all participating countries would work hard to reach an agreement on the existing common basis; in particular, Foreign Minister Molotov summarized the discussions of the past six weeks, summarized the common points of various opinions, and put forward five suggestions on the basic principles for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, requesting the conference to adopt them as a common basis for further resolving differences of opinion. The Soviet delegation's proposal is as follows:

    "The participants of the Geneva Conference have reached an agreement on the following basic principles for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue:

    1.  In order to unify Korea and establish a unified, independent, and democratic Korean state, free elections should be held throughout the territory of Korea.

        The election should be held within six months after the conclusion of this agreement.

        The election should be conducted on the basis of secret ballot and universal suffrage.

        The number of representatives of the all-Korean legislative body should be proportional to the population of all of Korea.

    2.  In order to prepare and conduct free elections throughout Korea and to promote reconciliation between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, an all-Korean institution composed of representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea should be established.

        The composition and tasks of this institution remain to be further studied.

    3.  All foreign troops should withdraw from Korea within a specified period.

        The time limit and stages for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from North Korea and South Korea before the free elections throughout Korea remain to be further studied.

    4.  It should be decided to establish an appropriate international commission to supervise the holding of free elections throughout Korea.

        The composition of this commission remains to be further studied.

    5.  In view of the importance of preventing any disruption to the peace of Korea, it should be considered necessary for countries with the most direct relationship to the maintenance of peace in the Far East to undertake obligations to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea, which will promote the solution of the issue of national unification of Korea.

        The question of which countries will undertake obligations to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea and the nature of such obligations remains to be further studied."

    The Soviet delegation's proposal aroused great attention from the participating delegates. It is generally believed in this area that this is a constructive and major effort by peaceful and democratic countries to promote the Geneva Conference to reach an agreement on the Korean issue quickly.

    In sharp contrast to this were the attitudes of the representatives of the United States, South Korea, and the Philippines. After the speeches of the foreign ministers of North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, U.S. representative Smith, with an attitude of denying everything, wantonly attacked Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal on the establishment of an all-Korean committee and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal on the composition of a neutral nations supervisory committee. Smith's unreasonable and arrogant attitude blatantly demonstrated the U.S. position of refusing consultation and refusing a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Observers here believe that Smith adopted this crude attitude in order to try to weaken the huge impact caused by Foreign Minister Molotov's five-point proposal. South Korean representative Pyun Yung-tai was even more blatant in this regard, saying nonsensically that the speeches of the foreign ministers of North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union had no new content and were not worth responding to. The Philippine representative also expressed his wholehearted support for Pyun Yung-tai's so-called "Fourteen Points Proposal," which in essence was to impose the reactionary and traitorous Syngman Rhee regime on the people of North Korea.

    The Abyssinian representative, Herut, spoke first. Herut first stated that the reason why he had to come out and say a few words was because he was afraid that someone would misunderstand his position. Then he made it clear that his position was to oppose Nam Il's reasonable proposal and support the obviously extremely unreasonable proposal of the South Korean representative. He believed that now was the time to seek a common basis for rapprochement between various viewpoints, but he also insisted that the United Nations must in principle interfere in Korea.

    Nam Il, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, then spoke.

    Nam Il first pointed out that in the process of discussing the Korean issue, two different attitudes were shown towards the task of realizing the national unification of Korea and establishing a unified, independent, and democratic country by peaceful means. On the one hand, on April 27, when the Geneva Conference began, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward specific proposals. These proposals stipulated that elections should be held throughout Korea on the basis of an agreement between North Korea and South Korea, in a free atmosphere without foreign interference and without pressure on voters from local authorities and terrorist groups. On the other hand, the South Korean delegation's proposal stipulated that elections should be held in South Korea, which is still occupied by foreign troops, on the basis of subordinating North Korea to the South Korean regime established with the help of these foreign troops.

    Nam Il pointed out that it is essential to establish an all-Korean institution to prepare for and conduct elections, and to resolve the issue of restoring cultural and economic relations between the two parts of Korea. Without establishing such an all-Korean institution, there can be no progress in seeking an agreement acceptable to both parts of Korea.

    Nam Il pointed out that the various excuses used by the South Korean representative and some delegations to oppose the establishment of an all-Korean institution are unreasonable. He said that all decisions of this all-Korean institution are made by the common agreement of both parties participating, so there is no question of imposing unilateral decisions on one party.

    Nam Il expressed his disagreement with the proposal that the United Nations should supervise the elections. Nam Il said that only a neutral nations committee can guarantee fair supervision of elections in Korea.

    Nam Il said that in order to make the election truly free and to enable the voters in South Korea to freely express their will, the US troops must withdraw from South Korea at the same time as the Chinese People's Volunteers withdraw from North Korea. It is obvious that if the US troops do not withdraw from Korea, there is no guarantee of the freedom for voters to express their will.

    Nam Il said that as for the opinions expressed here by some representatives that all foreign troops should gradually withdraw from Korea, we do not oppose it in principle, as long as the principle of proportionality is observed in this regard. We suggest that concrete discussions be held on the date of withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea.

    Nam Il finally said that the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that if the participants in this conference are sincerely willing to resolve the Korean issue by peacefully unifying Korea on a democratic basis, then the proposals we have put forward, as well as the proposals put forward by the People's Republic of China on the supervision of all-Korean elections by a neutral nations institution, are a good basis for such a solution.

    Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, then spoke.

  (Full text to be issued separately)

    Philippine representative Garcia then spoke. He recited an empty speech. Apart from repeating the clich√©s that the United Nations must continue to interfere in Korea and expressing support for the South Korean representative's proposal, he did not put forward any positive opinions.

    The meeting continued after a fifteen-minute break.

    Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov made an important speech.

    Molotov said that the discussion on the Korean issue has been going on at this conference for more than a month. The discussion of this urgent international issue related to the maintenance of peace and security in the Far East has aroused close attention in all countries. The people of Asian countries are particularly concerned about the discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, and they, together with the people of all peace-loving countries, hope that the current conference will adopt a decision by unanimous agreement to ensure the early peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, so as to promote the national unification of Korea and the establishment of an independent and democratic Korean country, thereby easing international tensions.

    Molotov said that all this undoubtedly places a great responsibility on all participants of the Geneva Conference to conduct an objective and fair study of the Korean issue, so as to seek a solution to the Korean issue in accordance with the interests of the Korean people and for the consolidation of international peace.

    Molotov said that it would be beneficial to summarize some of the results of the general debate at this time. It can be said that as a result of the exchange of views, there has been a certain degree of reconciliation of opinions on some basic principles that serve as the basis for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    Molotov said that there is ample reason to specifically point out such important issues on which the Soviet delegation believes that the conference can immediately make a unanimous agreement decision, because on these issues, the opinions of the delegations have reached a certain degree of consensus, these issues are:

    (1) The participants expressed their support for holding elections to the all-Korean National Assembly throughout Korea, which must enable the Korean people to freely express their will and realize their legitimate desire to unify the country on a democratic basis. Naturally, this election should be held in accordance with the all-Korean election law, which will stipulate universal suffrage, secret ballot, and proportional representation in the all-Korean legislative body.

      (2) During the discussion, a suggestion was discussed regarding the establishment of an all-Korean institution to prepare for and conduct general elections. It is impossible to imagine that after all the previous events, such an extremely important measure for Korea as holding general elections can be taken without full preparation throughout Korea and without considering the economic and political characteristics that exist in the country. If the conference agrees in principle to establish an all-Korean institution for the above-mentioned purposes, it will be a step forward, because without this institution, all-Korean elections would be practically impossible. As for the composition, functions, and principles according to which it conducts activities, these issues can be discussed separately.

    (3) The participants in the conference recognized that any solution to the Korean issue should stipulate that all foreign armed forces withdraw from Korea. Since all participants in the conference recognize the necessity of withdrawing foreign troops, it would be a positive factor if the conference indicated in principle that it agreed to the withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Korea. As for the specific time limits for the withdrawal of foreign armed forces from North Korea and South Korea, it should be discussed separately.

    (4) All participants agreed that all-Korean elections should be held under the supervision of an international institution. However, there were different opinions at the meeting regarding the procedures that should be followed to create this international institution. The Soviet delegation believes that the conference can in principle decide on the establishment of an international commission to supervise the holding of elections. As for the composition of this commission and its scope of authority, further exchange of views can be conducted to reach an agreement.

    (5) All participants pointed out the importance of creating the necessary conditions to prevent violations of the Korean Armistice Agreement and to ensure the peaceful development of Korea. Obviously, the conference must not avoid this serious issue related to the maintenance of peace in Korea. At present, the conference has been able to pass a decision on the issue that the countries most concerned about guaranteeing the peaceful development of Korea must undertake appropriate obligations. As for the question of which countries specifically should undertake the above-mentioned obligations and the nature of these obligations, it should be discussed separately.

    Molotov said that the Soviet delegation believes that these are the issues that should be considered first. The principles on which some participants have different views from each other should also be carefully considered, and efforts should be made to seek practical ways to implement them. The Soviet delegation has no intention of underestimating these differences.

    Molotov said that the Soviet delegation believes that the participants must strive to reconcile their views and reach a mutually acceptable agreement on these principles. In this regard, the Soviet delegation believes that the representatives are now able to conduct concrete discussions on the above-mentioned issues related to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. At the same time, it is also appropriate to list the fundamental issues on which some representatives were able to reach agreement during the discussion in a corresponding decision.

    Then, Molotov put forward the draft resolution proposed by the Soviet delegation.

    Molotov said that the current proposal of the Soviet delegation emphatically raises such issues on which the Soviet delegation believes that it is possible to pass a unanimous decision. However, it can be clearly seen from the text of this proposal that even if these general provisions are adopted, there are still some issues that have not been resolved, and without reaching an agreement on these issues, it is impossible to realize the national unification of Korea. Everyone should not underestimate the complex nature of the current situation.

    Molotov then talked about the speech made by the US representative on May 28. Molotov pointed out that the US representative tried his best to defend the US aggression against Korea and the illegal actions of the United Nations organization that directly and repeatedly violated the UN Charter. The US representative tried his best to describe the US aggression against Korea as the implementation of the principle of collective security, and of course it is impossible to do this without distorting the facts.

    Molotov said that the US representative even insisted that the Soviet Union denies the principle of collective security. Molotov cited many facts to prove that the Soviet Union is the most active fighter in defending the principle of collective security, and it has been and still is in favor of the practical application of the above-mentioned principle.

    Molotov said that speaking of the United Nations, the Soviet Union, as one of the founders of this organization, has always tried to make this organization a true organization to guarantee peace and international security, because the UN Charter, its basic principles, and the purpose for which this international organization was established all require this.

    Molotov pointed out that it is the United States that has violated the principles of the United Nations and the UN Charter. While fighting against actions that violate the basic principles of the United Nations and violate the UN Charter, the Soviet Union is also safeguarding the honor and authority of the United Nations.

    Molotov said that the US representative at the conference tried to portray the US ruling group as fighters for justice and peace, as defenders of human rights and guardians of moral principles. But even now, when the method of peaceful resolution of the Korean issue has not yet been discussed, a new threat of aggression by the United States has already occurred‚Äîthis time in the Southeast Asian region‚Äîit is enough to point this out.

    Molotov said that the US representative supported the proposals put forward by the South Korean representative, but it is very obvious that these proposals are not in line with the actual situation in Korea, and therefore cannot serve as the basis for the resolution of the Geneva Conference.

    Molotov finally said that the Soviet delegation is trying to make only such clauses included in the draft resolution to draw the attention of the representatives: these clauses can serve as the basis for the Geneva Conference's resolution on the Korean issue, if everyone shows sincerity in reaching an agreement, At the same time, the Soviet delegation also suggested that the exchange of views on the issues in dispute should continue.

    Molotov said that the Soviet delegation believes that the adoption of the above-mentioned resolution will advance the future work of the conference and contribute to the achievement of an agreement that is in line with the interests of the Korean people and strengthens world peace.

    The Dutch representative then spoke. He said: He does not deny that there are common points at the meeting. He believes that everyone has agreed to hold elections throughout Korea, which is encouraging. He also believes that Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal to hold elections throughout Korea according to the principle of proportional representation is also encouraging. However, he went on to insist that the all-Korean committee is "impractical." He expressed his support for the so-called "Fourteen Points Proposal" put forward by Pyun Yung-tai, and echoed the US opinion, advocating that the Korean elections should be held under the auspices of the United Nations, which is a belligerent party. The Dutch representative finally said that he would carefully study the proposal put forward by Molotov on the 5th.

    The next speaker was South Korean representative Pyun Yung-tai. He said nonsensically that the speeches of Foreign Minister Nam Il, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, and Foreign Minister Molotov had no new content and were not worth responding to.

    US representative Smith spoke. Smith began by saying that he wanted to "restrain" himself, but fearing that Molotov's proposal would have a huge impact, he adopted an unreasonable attitude and made malicious and crude slanders against the peaceful sincerity of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union in this speech. Smith repeated the old tunes that have long been refuted, insisting that the all-Korean committee would be a so-called "super-governmental organization." Smith also used lengthy words to obliterate the role of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in the Korean armistice. The only basis Smith could come up with was the letters from the Swiss and Swedish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, but he never mentioned the reports of the other two members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission‚Äîthe Polish and Czechoslovak members, let alone the "interim report" and "final report" jointly issued by the Indian, Polish, and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Smith's speech once again showed that the United States is trying its best to prevent the Geneva Conference from reaching an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, then spoke.

    Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai said, I want to state that the delegation of the People's Republic of China cannot agree with Mr. Smith, the US representative, on his interpretation of the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in the Korean armistice. The document he cited is a document of the Swiss and Swedish members, but the other two Polish and Czechoslovak members have different interpretations. In order not to delay everyone's time, we will send the documents issued by the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to the delegations after the meeting. I also reserve the right to reply at a later opportunity to the opinions just expressed by Mr. Smith that we cannot agree to.

    The chairman announced that no one requested to speak, and the date of the next meeting would be notified separately.

    The meeting adjourned at 7:10 p.m.
