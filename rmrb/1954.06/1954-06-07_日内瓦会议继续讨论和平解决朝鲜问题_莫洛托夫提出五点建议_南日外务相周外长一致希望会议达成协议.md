Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 5th: The Geneva Conference held its thirteenth plenary session on the Korean issue on the 5th. The chairman was Prince Wan Waithayakon of Thailand.

    The outstanding feature of the 5th session was that the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union fully demonstrated their sincere desire to seek an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in a spirit of consultation and reconciliation. At the 5th session, Foreign Minister Nam Il hoped that the Geneva Conference could reach an agreement based on the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the supplementary proposals of the People's Republic of China; Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out that there was a common basis for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and hoped that the representatives of all participating countries would work hard to reach an agreement on the existing common basis; in particular, Foreign Minister Molotov summarized the discussions of the past six weeks, summarized the common points of various opinions, and put forward five suggestions on the basic principles for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, requesting the conference to adopt them as a common basis for further resolving differences of opinion. The Soviet delegation's proposal is as follows:

    "The participants of the Geneva Conference have reached an agreement on the following basic principles for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue:

    1.  In order to unify Korea and establish a unified, independent, and democratic Korean state, free elections should be held throughout the territory of Korea.

        The election should be held within six months after the conclusion of this agreement.

        The election should be conducted on the basis of secret ballot and universal suffrage.

        The number of representatives of the all-Korean legislative body should be proportional to the population of all of Korea.

    2.  In order to prepare and conduct free elections throughout Korea and to promote reconciliation between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, an all-Korean institution composed of representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea should be established.

        The composition and tasks of this institution remain to be further studied.

    3.  All foreign troops should withdraw from Korea within a specified period.

        The time limit and stages for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from North Korea and South Korea before the free elections throughout Korea remain to be further studied.

    4.  It should be decided to establish an appropriate international commission to supervise the holding of free elections throughout Korea.

        The composition of this commission remains to be further studied.

    5.  In view of the importance of preventing any disruption to the peace of Korea, it should be considered necessary for countries with the most direct relationship to the maintenance of peace in the Far East to undertake obligations to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea, which will promote the solution of the issue of national unification of Korea.

        The question of which countries will undertake obligations to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea and the nature of such obligations remains to be further studied."

    The Soviet delegation's proposal aroused great attention from the participating delegates. It is generally believed in this area that this is a constructive and major effort by peaceful and democratic countries to promote the Geneva Conference to reach an agreement on the Korean issue quickly.

    In sharp contrast to this were the attitudes of the representatives of the United States, South Korea, and the Philippines. After the speeches of the foreign ministers of North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, U.S. representative Smith, with an attitude of denying everything, wantonly attacked Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal on the establishment of an all-Korean committee and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal on the composition of a neutral nations supervisory committee. Smith's unreasonable and arrogant attitude blatantly demonstrated the U.S. position of refusing consultation and refusing a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Observers here believe that Smith adopted this crude attitude in order to try to weaken the huge impact caused by Foreign Minister Molotov's five-point proposal. South Korean representative Pyun Yung-tai was even more blatant in this regard, saying nonsensically that the speeches of the foreign ministers of North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union had no new content and were not worth responding to. The Philippine representative also expressed his wholehearted support for Pyun Yung-tai's so-called "Fourteen Points Proposal," which in essence was to impose the reactionary and traitorous Syngman Rhee regime on the people of North Korea.

    The Abyssinian representative, Herut, spoke first. Herut first stated that the reason why he had to come out and say a few words was because he was afraid that someone would misunderstand his position. Then he made it clear that his position was to oppose Nam Il's reasonable proposal and support the obviously extremely unreasonable proposal of the South Korean representative. He believed that now was the time to seek a common basis for rapprochement between various viewpoints, but he also insisted that the United Nations must in principle interfere in Korea.

    Nam Il, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, then spoke.

    Nam Il first pointed out that in the process of discussing the Korean issue, two different attitudes were shown towards the task of realizing the national unification of Korea and establishing a unified, independent, and democratic country by peaceful means. On the one hand, on April 27, when the Geneva Conference began, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward specific proposals. These proposals stipulated that elections should be held throughout Korea on the basis of an agreement between North Korea and South Korea, in a free atmosphere without foreign interference and without pressure on voters from local authorities and terrorist groups. On the other hand, the South Korean delegation's proposal stipulated that elections should be held in South Korea, which is still occupied by foreign troops, on the basis of subordinating North Korea to the South Korean regime established with the help of these foreign troops.

    Nam Il pointed out that it is essential to establish an all-Korean institution to prepare for and conduct elections, and to resolve the issue of restoring cultural and economic relations between the two parts of Korea. Without establishing such an all-Korean institution, there can be no progress in seeking an agreement acceptable to both parts of Korea.

    Nam Il pointed out that the various excuses used by the South Korean representative and some delegations to oppose the establishment of an all-Korean institution are unreasonable. He said that all decisions of this all-Korean institution are made by the common agreement of both parties participating, so there is no question of imposing unilateral decisions on one party.

    Nam Il expressed his disagreement with the proposal that the United Nations should supervise the elections. Nam Il said that only a neutral nations committee can guarantee fair supervision of elections in Korea.

    Nam Il said that in order to make the election truly free and to enable the voters in South Korea to freely express their will, the US troops must withdraw from South Korea at the same time as the Chinese People's Volunteers withdraw from North Korea. It is obvious that if the US troops do not withdraw from Korea, there is no guarantee of the freedom for voters to express their will.

    Nam Il said that as for the opinions expressed here by some representatives that all foreign troops should gradually withdraw from Korea, we do not oppose it in principle, as long as the principle of proportionality is observed in this regard. We suggest that concrete discussions be held on the date of withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea.

    Nam Il finally said that the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that if the participants in this conference are sincerely willing to resolve the Korean issue by peacefully unifying Korea on a democratic basis, then the proposals we have put forward, as well as the proposals put forward by the People's Republic of China on the supervision of all-Korean elections by a neutral nations institution, are a good basis for such a solution.

    Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, then spoke.

  (Full text to be issued separately)

    Philippine representative Garcia then spoke. He recited an empty speech. Apart from repeating the clichés that the United Nations must continue to interfere in Korea and expressing support for the South Korean representative's proposal, he did not put forward any positive opinions.

    The meeting continued after a fifteen-minute break.

    Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov made an important speech.

    Molotov said that the discussion on the Korean issue has been going on at this conference for more than a month. The discussion of this urgent international issue related to the maintenance of peace and security in the Far East has aroused close attention in all countries. The people of Asian countries are particularly concerned about the discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, and they, together with the people of all peace-loving countries, hope that the current conference will adopt a decision by unanimous agreement to ensure the early peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, so as to promote the national unification of Korea and the establishment of an independent and democratic Korean country, thereby easing international tensions.

    Molotov said that all this undoubtedly places a great responsibility on all participants of the Geneva Conference to conduct an objective and fair study of the Korean issue, so as to seek a solution to the Korean issue in accordance with the interests of the Korean people and for the consolidation of international peace.

    Molotov said that it would be beneficial to summarize some of the results of the general debate at this time. It can be said that as a result of the exchange of views, there has been a certain degree of reconciliation of opinions on some basic principles that serve as the basis for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    Molotov said that there is ample reason to specifically point out such important issues on which the Soviet delegation believes that the conference can immediately make a unanimous agreement decision, because on these issues, the opinions of the delegations have reached a certain degree of consensus, these issues are:

    (1) The participants expressed their support for holding elections to the all-Korean National Assembly throughout Korea, which must enable the Korean people to freely express their will and realize their legitimate desire to unify the country on a democratic basis. Naturally, this election should be held in accordance with the all-Korean election law, which will stipulate universal suffrage, secret ballot, and proportional representation in the all-Korean legislative body.

      (2) During the discussion, a suggestion was discussed regarding the establishment of an all-Korean institution to prepare for and conduct general elections. It is impossible to imagine that after all the previous events, such an extremely important measure for Korea as holding general elections can be taken without full preparation throughout Korea and without considering the economic and political characteristics that exist in the country. If the conference agrees in principle to establish an all-Korean institution for the above-mentioned purposes, it will be a step forward, because without this institution, all-Korean elections would be practically impossible. As for the composition, functions, and principles according to which it conducts activities, these issues can be discussed separately.

    (3) The participants in the conference recognized that any solution to the Korean issue should stipulate that all foreign armed forces withdraw from Korea. Since all participants in the conference recognize the necessity of withdrawing foreign troops, it would be a positive factor if the conference indicated in principle that it agreed to the withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Korea. As for the specific time limits for the withdrawal of foreign armed forces from North Korea and South Korea, it should be discussed separately.

    (4) All participants agreed that all-Korean elections should be held under the supervision of an international institution. However, there were different opinions at the meeting regarding the procedures that should be followed to create this international institution. The Soviet delegation believes that the conference can in principle decide on the establishment of an international commission to supervise the holding of elections. As for the composition of this commission and its scope of authority, further exchange of views can be conducted to reach an agreement.

    (5) All participants pointed out the importance of creating the necessary conditions to prevent violations of the Korean Armistice Agreement and to ensure the peaceful development of Korea. Obviously, the conference must not avoid this serious issue related to the maintenance of peace in Korea. At present, the conference has been able to pass a decision on the issue that the countries most concerned about guaranteeing the peaceful development of Korea must undertake appropriate obligations. As for the question of which countries specifically should undertake the above-mentioned obligations and the nature of these obligations, it should be discussed separately.

    Molotov said that the Soviet delegation believes that these are the issues that should be considered first. The principles on which some participants have different views from each other should also be carefully considered, and efforts should be made to seek practical ways to implement them. The Soviet delegation has no intention of underestimating these differences.

    Molotov said that the Soviet delegation believes that the participants must strive to reconcile their views and reach a mutually acceptable agreement on these principles. In this regard, the Soviet delegation believes that the representatives are now able to conduct concrete discussions on the above-mentioned issues related to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. At the same time, it is also appropriate to list the fundamental issues on which some representatives were able to reach agreement during the discussion in a corresponding decision.

    Then, Molotov put forward the draft resolution proposed by the Soviet delegation.

    Molotov said that the current proposal of the Soviet delegation emphatically raises such issues on which the Soviet delegation believes that it is possible to pass a unanimous decision. However, it can be clearly seen from the text of this proposal that even if these general provisions are adopted, there are still some issues that have not been resolved, and without reaching an agreement on these issues, it is impossible to realize the national unification of Korea. Everyone should not underestimate the complex nature of the current situation.

    Molotov then talked about the speech made by the US representative on May 28. Molotov pointed out that the US representative tried his best to defend the US aggression against Korea and the illegal actions of the United Nations organization that directly and repeatedly violated the UN Charter. The US representative tried his best to describe the US aggression against Korea as the implementation of the principle of collective security, and of course it is impossible to do this without distorting the facts.

    Molotov said that the US representative even insisted that the Soviet Union denies the principle of collective security. Molotov cited many facts to prove that the Soviet Union is the most active fighter in defending the principle of collective security, and it has been and still is in favor of the practical application of the above-mentioned principle.

    Molotov said that speaking of the United Nations, the Soviet Union, as one of the founders of this organization, has always tried to make this organization a true organization to guarantee peace and international security, because the UN Charter, its basic principles, and the purpose for which this international organization was established all require this.

    Molotov pointed out that it is the United States that has violated the principles of the United Nations and the UN Charter. While fighting against actions that violate the basic principles of the United Nations and violate the UN Charter, the Soviet Union is also safeguarding the honor and authority of the United Nations.

    Molotov said that the US representative at the conference tried to portray the US ruling group as fighters for justice and peace, as defenders of human rights and guardians of moral principles. But even now, when the method of peaceful resolution of the Korean issue has not yet been discussed, a new threat of aggression by the United States has already occurred—this time in the Southeast Asian region—it is enough to point this out.

    Molotov said that the US representative supported the proposals put forward by the South Korean representative, but it is very obvious that these proposals are not in line with the actual situation in Korea, and therefore cannot serve as the basis for the resolution of the Geneva Conference.

    Molotov finally said that the Soviet delegation is trying to make only such clauses included in the draft resolution to draw the attention of the representatives: these clauses can serve as the basis for the Geneva Conference's resolution on the Korean issue, if everyone shows sincerity in reaching an agreement, At the same time, the Soviet delegation also suggested that the exchange of views on the issues in dispute should continue.

    Molotov said that the Soviet delegation believes that the adoption of the above-mentioned resolution will advance the future work of the conference and contribute to the achievement of an agreement that is in line with the interests of the Korean people and strengthens world peace.

    The Dutch representative then spoke. He said: He does not deny that there are common points at the meeting. He believes that everyone has agreed to hold elections throughout Korea, which is encouraging. He also believes that Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal to hold elections throughout Korea according to the principle of proportional representation is also encouraging. However, he went on to insist that the all-Korean committee is "impractical." He expressed his support for the so-called "Fourteen Points Proposal" put forward by Pyun Yung-tai, and echoed the US opinion, advocating that the Korean elections should be held under the auspices of the United Nations, which is a belligerent party. The Dutch representative finally said that he would carefully study the proposal put forward by Molotov on the 5th.

    The next speaker was South Korean representative Pyun Yung-tai. He said nonsensically that the speeches of Foreign Minister Nam Il, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, and Foreign Minister Molotov had no new content and were not worth responding to.

    US representative Smith spoke. Smith began by saying that he wanted to "restrain" himself, but fearing that Molotov's proposal would have a huge impact, he adopted an unreasonable attitude and made malicious and crude slanders against the peaceful sincerity of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union in this speech. Smith repeated the old tunes that have long been refuted, insisting that the all-Korean committee would be a so-called "super-governmental organization." Smith also used lengthy words to obliterate the role of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in the Korean armistice. The only basis Smith could come up with was the letters from the Swiss and Swedish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, but he never mentioned the reports of the other two members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission—the Polish and Czechoslovak members, let alone the "interim report" and "final report" jointly issued by the Indian, Polish, and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Smith's speech once again showed that the United States is trying its best to prevent the Geneva Conference from reaching an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, then spoke.

    Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai said, I want to state that the delegation of the People's Republic of China cannot agree with Mr. Smith, the US representative, on his interpretation of the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in the Korean armistice. The document he cited is a document of the Swiss and Swedish members, but the other two Polish and Czechoslovak members have different interpretations. In order not to delay everyone's time, we will send the documents issued by the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to the delegations after the meeting. I also reserve the right to reply at a later opportunity to the opinions just expressed by Mr. Smith that we cannot agree to.

    The chairman announced that no one requested to speak, and the date of the next meeting would be notified separately.

    The meeting adjourned at 7:10 p.m.

    日内瓦会议继续讨论和平解决朝鲜问题
    莫洛托夫提出五点建议
    南日外务相周外长一致希望会议达成协议
   【新华社日内瓦五日电】日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论五日举行第十三次全体会议。主席是泰国代表旺亲王。
    五日会议的突出的特点是：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联的代表们充分表现了以协商的、和解的精神努力寻求达成和平解决朝鲜问题的协议的真诚愿望。在五日会议上，南日外务相希望日内瓦会议能以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的建议和中华人民共和国的补充建议为基础达成协议；周恩来外长指出，和平解决朝鲜问题的共同基础是存在的，希望与会各国代表在已有的共同基础上努力达成协议；特别是莫洛托夫外长总结了过去六个星期中的讨论，归纳了各方面意见的共同之点，提出了有关和平解决朝鲜问题的基本原则的五点建议，请求大会通过，作为进一步解决分歧意见的共同基础。苏联代表团的建议如下：
    “日内瓦会议的参加者已就下列关于和平解决朝鲜问题的基本原则达成协议：
    一、为了统一朝鲜，并建立一个统一、独立和民主的朝鲜国家，应在全朝鲜领土上举行自由选举。
    选举应在本协议缔结后六个月内举行。
    选举应该在秘密投票和普遍选举权的基础上进行。
    全朝鲜立法机构的代表名额应该和全朝鲜人口成比例。
    二、为准备和进行全朝鲜自由选举，并促进朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国之间的和解，应建立由朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表和大韩民国代表组成的全朝鲜机构。
    这个机构的组成和任务有待进一步的研究。
    三、一切外国军队应在规定期间内撤出朝鲜。
      一切外国军队在全朝鲜自由选举以前撤出北朝鲜和南朝鲜的时限和阶段问题，有待进一步的研究。
    四、应该决定成立适当的国际委员会来监督全朝鲜自由选举的举行。
    这个委员会的组成有待进一步的研究。
    五、鉴于防止对朝鲜和平的任何破坏的重要性，应该认为对维护远东和平有最直接关系的国家有必要承担义务，来保证朝鲜的和平发展，这将促进朝鲜全国统一问题的解决。
    哪些国家将承担义务来保证朝鲜的和平发展以及这种义务的性质问题，有待进一步的研究。”
    苏联代表团的建议引起了与会代表们的极大注意。此间舆论界普遍认为这是和平民主国家促进日内瓦会议就朝鲜问题迅速达成协议的建设性的重大努力。
    与此成尖锐对照的是美国、南朝鲜和菲律宾的代表们的态度。在朝、中、苏三国外长发言之后，美国代表史密斯用否定一切的态度，肆意攻击南日外务相关于成立全朝鲜委员会的建议和周恩来外长关于组成中立国监察委员会的建议。史密斯的蛮横无理的态度，露骨地表现了美国拒绝协商、拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题的立场。此间观察家认为，史密斯采取这种粗暴的态度，为的是企图减弱莫洛托夫外长的五点建议所引起的巨大的影响。南朝鲜代表卞荣泰在这方面表现得更加赤裸裸，他信口开河地说朝、中、苏三国外长的发言毫无新内容，值不得答复。菲律宾代表也表示他全心全意支持卞荣泰的所谓“十四点建议”，这个“建议”实质上就是要把反动透顶的卖国的李承晚政权强加于北朝鲜人民头上。
    阿比西尼亚代表赫沃特首先发言。赫沃特首先声明，他之所以必需出来说几句话，是因为唯恐有人误解了他的立场。接着他就表明他的立场是反对南日的合理的建议，支持南朝鲜代表的显然极不合理的建议。他认为现在是在各种不同观点之间寻求接近的共同基础的时候了，可是他又主张必须在原则上让联合国干涉朝鲜。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日接着发言。
    南日首先指出，在朝鲜问题的讨论过程中，对于实现朝鲜的国家统一和以和平方法建立单一、独立和民主的国家这个任务表现出了两种不同的态度。一方面，在四月二十七日，当日内瓦会议开始的时候，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团就提出了具体的建议。这些建议规定根据北朝鲜和南朝鲜之间的协议，在没有外国干涉、也没有地方当局和恐怖集团对选民施加压力的自由气氛中，举行全朝鲜的选举。另一方面，南朝鲜代表团的建议规定在南朝鲜仍为外国军队所占领的条件下，在使北朝鲜隶属于倚靠这些外国军队帮助建立的南朝鲜政权的基础上，举行选举。
    南日指出，建立一个全朝鲜机构来准备和举行选举，并解决朝鲜两部分之间恢复文化和经济关系的问题，是十分必要的。不建立这样一个全朝鲜机构，在求得朝鲜两部分都能接受的协议方面，就不可能有任何进展。
    南日指出，南朝鲜代表和某些代表团用来反对建立一个全朝鲜机构的种种借口是没有道理的。他说，这种全朝鲜机构的一切决定是由参加双方的共同协议而作出的，因此不存在将片面决定强加于一方的问题。
    南日表示不能同意由联合国来监察选举的主张。南日说，只有一个中立国委员会才能保证对朝鲜选举实行公正的监察。
    南日说，为了使选举能真正自由，使南朝鲜的选民能自由表达他们的意志，在中国人民志愿军撤出北朝鲜的同时，美国军队必须撤出南朝鲜。很明显，如果美国军队不撤出朝鲜，选民们表达自己的意志的自由就没有保障。
    南日说，至于有些代表在这里表示过的一切外国军队从朝鲜逐渐撤退的意见，我们原则上并不反对，只要在这当中遵守按比例的原则。我们建议对一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的日期进行具体讨论。
    南日最后说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团认为，如果参加本会议的人真诚愿意通过在民主基础上和平统一朝鲜来解决朝鲜问题，那末我们所提出的建议，以及中华人民共和国所提出的由中立国机构监督全朝鲜选举的建议，就是这种解决的良好基础。
    中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来接着发言。
  （全文另发）
    菲律宾代表加西亚接着发言。他诵读了一篇空空洞洞的发言稿。他除了重复那些主张必须由联合国来继续干涉朝鲜的滥调以及表示支持南朝鲜代表的建议以外，没有提出任何积极性的意见。
    会议在休息十五分钟后继续举行。
    苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫作了重要发言。
    莫洛托夫说，在这个会议上，朝鲜问题的讨论已经进行了一个多月了。关于这个和维持远东和平与安全有关的迫切的国际问题的讨论，在世界各国引起了密切的注意。亚洲各国人民对于日内瓦会议上朝鲜问题的讨论表现得特别关心，他们和一切爱好和平的国家的人民在一起，希望现在的会议通过一致协议的决定，保证朝鲜问题早日和平解决，以促成朝鲜的国家统一和建立一个独立、民主的朝鲜国家，从而缓和国际紧张局势。
    莫洛托夫说，所有这些无疑地使日内瓦会议的全体到会者负有很大的责任来对朝鲜问题作客观的、公正的研究，以按照朝鲜人民的利益并为了巩固国际和平而谋求朝鲜问题的解决。
    莫洛托夫说，目前来总结一下一般性辩论的一些结果是有好处的。可以这样说，由于交换意见的结果，在作为和平解决朝鲜问题的基础的一些基本原则上，意见已经有了一定程度的调和。
    莫洛托夫说，有充分理由能够特别指出这样一些重要问题来，在这些问题上，苏联代表团认为，会议能够立刻作出一致协议的决定，因为在这些问题上，各代表团的意见已经有了一定程度的一致，这些问题是：
    （一）与会者表示赞成在朝鲜各地举行全朝鲜国民议会选举，这个选举必须使朝鲜人民有可能自由地表示他们的意志，并实现他们的要求在民主基础上统一国家的正当的愿望。自然，这次选举应该根据全朝鲜选举法来举行，这个选举法将规定普遍的选举权、秘密投票和在全朝鲜立法机构中的比例代表制度。
      （二）在讨论过程中，曾讨论了关于设立一个全朝鲜机构来准备和举行普选的建议。不可能设想，在发生了以往种种事件以后，可以不经过在朝鲜全国各地的充分准备和在不考虑到国内所存在的经济和政治特点的情况下，采取像举行普选这种对朝鲜极为重要的措施。假使会议在原则上同意为了上述目的而设立全朝鲜机构，那将是向前迈进了一步，因为假使没有这个机构，全朝鲜选举实际上不可能举行。至于这个机构的组成、职务和它进行活动所根据的原则等问题，可以另行讨论。
    （三）会议的参加者承认，任何解决朝鲜问题的方案都应该规定，一切外国武装部队撤离朝鲜。由于会议的全体参加者都承认外国军队撤退的必要性，因此，假使会议在原则上表明它同意所有外国武装部队撤离朝鲜，那将是一个积极的因素。至于外国武装部队撤离北朝鲜和南朝鲜的具体限期，应该另行讨论。
    （四）所有与会者一致同意全朝鲜选举应该在一个国际机构的监督下举行。不过关于产生这个国际机构所应该遵循的程序，在会上有了不同的意见。苏联代表团认为：会议能够在原则上决定关于建立国际委员会以监督举行选举的问题。至于这个委员会的组成以及它的职权范围，可以进一步地交换意见，以达成协议。
    （五）所有与会者都指出了为防止破坏朝鲜停战协定和保证朝鲜的和平发展而创造必要条件的重要性。显然，会议决不能避开这个和维护朝鲜和平有关的严重问题。在目前，会议已经能够就最关心保证朝鲜和平发展的国家必须承担适当的义务的问题通过决定了。至于具体地由哪些国家来承担上述义务以及这种义务的性质问题，应该另行讨论。
    莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团认为，这些就是应该首先加以考虑的问题。代表们对一些与会者彼此的看法还有出入的原则也应仔细地考虑，并尽力寻求实际的办法来实行。苏联代表团无意低估这些分歧。
    莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团认为，与会者必须努力调和他们的意见，并就这些原则达成彼此都能接受的协议。在这方面，苏联代表团认为，代表们现在能够就上述有关和平解决朝鲜问题的问题进行具体讨论了。同时，在一个相应的决定中把一些代表们在讨论过程中能够取得协议的根本问题列下来也是适当的。
    接着，莫洛托夫提出了苏联代表团提出的决议草案。
    莫洛托夫说，目前苏联代表团的建议强调地提出了这样一些问题，在这些问题上，苏联代表团认为，有可能通过一致的决定。不过，从这个建议的本文中可以明显地看出：即使通过了这些一般性的规定，仍然还有一些问题没有解决，而在这些问题上要是不达成协议是不可能实现朝鲜的国家统一的。大家不应该低估目前形势的错综复杂的性质。
    莫洛托夫接着谈到美国代表在五月二十八日的发言，莫洛托夫指出，美国代表尽力想为美国对朝鲜的侵略，以及联合国组织直接地并一再地破坏联合国宪章的那些非法行动辩护。美国代表尽力想把美国对朝鲜的侵略说成是执行集体安全的原则，当然要不歪曲事实是做不到这一点的。
    莫洛托夫说，美国代表竟硬说苏联否认集体安全的原则。莫洛托夫举出许多事实证明：苏联是捍卫集体安全原则的最积极的战士，它过去是，现在仍然是拥护实际应用上述原则的。
    莫洛托夫说，谈到联合国，苏联作为这个组织的创始者之一，一向尽力促使这个组织成为保障和平与国际安全的真正组织，因为联合国宪章、它的基本原则以及这一国际组织所以成立的宗旨都要求这样做。
    莫洛托夫指出，正是美国破坏了联合国的原则和联合国宪章。苏联一方面和破坏联合国的基本原则和破坏联合国宪章的行为作斗争，同时，还维护着联合国的荣誉和权力。
    莫洛托夫说，美国代表在会议上试图把美国统治集团说成是为正义与和平而战的战士，说成是人类权利的捍卫者和道义原则的守护者。但是就在现在，当和平解决朝鲜问题的办法还没有讨论完的时候，已经又发生了美国进行侵略的新威胁——这次是在东南亚地区——只要指出这一点就足够了。
    莫洛托夫说，美国代表支持南朝鲜代表提出的建议，但是，十分明显，这些建议是和朝鲜的实际情况不相符合的，因此不能作为日内瓦会议的决议的基础。
    莫洛托夫最后说，苏联代表团方面努力使列入决议草案以提请代表们注意的只是这样一些条款：这些条款可以作为日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的决议的基础，假如大家表现了对于达成协议有诚意的话，同时，苏联代表团还建议继续就争论中的问题交换意见。
    莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团认为，通过上述决议将推进会议今后的工作，并对达成符合于朝鲜人民的利益和加强世界和平的利益的协议有所贡献。
    荷兰代表接着发言。他说：他不否认会议上是存在着共同点的。他认为，大家都已同意在全朝鲜举行选举，这是令人鼓舞的。他还认为：南日外务相主张按比例代表原则在全朝鲜举行选举，也是令人鼓舞的。但是，他接着又硬说全朝鲜委员会是“不合实际”的。他表示支持卞荣泰所提出的所谓“十四点建议”，并附和美国的意见，主张朝鲜选举应在作为交战一方的联合国主持之下举行。荷兰代表最后表示他将仔细研究莫洛托夫五日所提出的建议。
    下一个发言的是南朝鲜代表卞荣泰。他信口开河地硬说南日外务相、周恩来外长和莫洛托夫外长的发言没有新内容，不值得答复。
    美国代表史密斯发言。史密斯一开头就表示他要“克制”自己，然而他唯恐莫洛托夫的建议引起巨大的影响，他采取了横蛮无理的态度，在这篇发言中对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中国和苏联的和平诚意进行恶意的、粗暴的诽谤。史密斯重复早已被驳倒了的老调，硬说全朝鲜委员会将是一个所谓
  “超政府组织”。史密斯还用了冗长的言辞来抹煞中立国监察委员会在朝鲜停战方面所起的作用。史密斯能够拿出来的唯一根据就是中立国监察委员会瑞士和瑞典委员的信件，然而他却绝口不提中立国监察委员会另两位委员——波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员的报告，更不敢提中立国遣返委员会印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克三国委员所共同发表的“临时报告”和“最后报告”。史密斯的发言，又一次表明了美国竭力阻挠日内瓦会议在和平解决朝鲜问题方面达成协议。
    中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来接着发言。
    周恩来外长说，我要声明一下，中华人民共和国代表团不能同意美国代表史密斯先生关于在朝鲜停战中中立国监察委员会工作的解释。他所引用的文件是瑞士、瑞典委员的文件，但另外两位波兰、捷克斯洛伐克委员却有不同的解释。为不耽搁大家的时间起见，我们将以中立国监察委员会的波兰、捷克斯洛伐克两位委员所发表的文件在会后送达各代表团。我并保留我在以后的机会中答复史密斯先生刚才所发表的我们不能同意的意见。
    主席宣布没有人要求发言，下次会议举行的日期另行通知。
    会议于七时十分休会。
