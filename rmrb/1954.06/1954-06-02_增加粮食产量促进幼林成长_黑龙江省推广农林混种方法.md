To increase grain production and promote the growth of young forests, Heilongjiang Province is promoting agroforestry methods.

    In this spring's construction of the western Manchurian shelterbelt, eighteen counties and banners in Heilongjiang Province, including Taonan, Anguang, Anda, Baicheng, Durbert Banner, and Guoerluosi Mongol Autonomous Banner, promoted an advanced method that can both ensure the healthy growth of saplings, increase their survival rate, and increase some grain production: the method of agroforestry.  As early as 1952, farmers in Baicheng, Anguang, and other counties implemented this method, intercropping a total of 119 hectares and harvesting 42.5 shi of grain. In 1953, 1,086 hectares were intercropped, yielding 2,477 shi of grain, while the survival rate of ordinary young trees reached over 80%. This year, with strong advocacy and technical guidance from the government, more farmers are practicing intercropping. Currently, Anguang, Taonan, Guoerluosi Mongol Autonomous Banner, and fourteen other counties and banners are organizing intercropping in conjunction with the final sowing work of the spring plowing campaign. According to statistics, these fourteen counties and banners have planted or have a good chance of implementing intercropping on 4,547 hectares, accounting for more than one-sixth of the province's afforestation area.  Assuming a minimum yield of 2.2 shi of grain per hectare, this can increase grain production by more than 10,000 shi, while the survival rate of these 4,000+ hectares of young forests can generally reach over 80%.

    Agroforestry involves planting appropriate crops, mainly legumes, in the spaces between rows of trees in the first and second years after the saplings are planted. According to the experience of the Soviet Union in constructing shelterbelts, intercropping appropriate crops in forestland can reduce weed growth by replacing the living space of weeds with crops. Certain crops, such as legumes, can also provide nutrients to the saplings through root nodule bacteria, promoting their growth. After two or three years, the saplings have grown up and are no longer threatened by weeds. This year, Heilongjiang Province has adopted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, planting crops while afforesting. Plowing the fields also means plowing the forestland, and those who plant and harvest the grain produced in the forestland get to keep it, increasing the farmers' enthusiasm for tending the forestland and removing weeds. This agroforestry method can generally be implemented for two years in a forestland area. In the current situation where the small-scale peasant economy still predominates in China's rural areas, it is an advanced method to ensure the survival rate of afforestation.

### 增加粮食产量促进幼林成长  黑龙江省推广农林混种方法

    增加粮食产量促进幼林成长
    黑龙江省推广农林混种方法
    黑龙江省洮南、安广、安达、白城、杜尔伯特旗和郭后旗等十八个县旗，在今年春季营造西满防护林带中，推广了一项既能使幼林健康生长提高成活率，又能增产部分粮食的先进方法——农林混种的方法。这种方法，一九五二年白城、安广等县就有农民实行，共混种了一百一十九垧，打粮四十二石五斗；一九五三年混种一千零八十六垧，打粮两千四百七十七石，而一般幼树的成活率都达到了百分之八十以上。今年经政府大力提倡并给予技术上的指导后，农民实行混种的更多。现在，安广、洮南、郭后旗等十四个县旗结合突击春耕最后播种工作组织混种，据统计，这十四个县旗已种上和一部分确有把握可以实行混种的可达到四千五百四十七垧，占全省造林面积的六分之一以上。以每垧最低产两石二斗粮食计算，即可增产粮食一万多石，而这四千多垧幼林成活率普遍可以达到百分之八十以上。
    农林混种就是在幼树栽植后的第一年和第二年在树的行与行的空地上，做垄种植适当的庄稼——主要是豆科作物。根据苏联营造防护林带的经验，林地里混种上适当的作物，由于野草的生活领域被作物所代替，可以减少野草生长，而某些作物如豆类的根瘤菌又可以供给幼树以养分，促进幼树的生长，过两三年之后，幼树已成长起来，就不再受杂草威胁了。今年黑龙江省接受了苏联的先进经验，在造林的同时，就种上庄稼，铲趟大田时也就铲趟了林地，林地内生产的粮食谁种谁收，提高了农民侍弄林地铲除杂草的积极性。这种农林混种的方法，一般地在一块林地内可实行两年。在目前我国农村小农经济仍占多数的情况下，它是保证造林成活率的一项先进方法。
