Xinhua News Agency, New York, 22nd: U.S. Federal Court Judge Sylvester Ryan recently sentenced three responsible persons of the overseas Chinese newspaper "China Daily News" published in New York to varying terms of imprisonment on the pretext of violating U.S. currency control regulations, and the newspaper was also fined a huge sum of money. This act of the U.S. authorities to destroy the publishing industry and wantonly persecute overseas Chinese newspapers and their responsible persons once again exposes the hypocrisy of the democracy and freedom flaunted by the U.S. government.

The activities of the U.S. authorities to persecute this newspaper, which safeguards the interests of overseas Chinese, began several years ago. The U.S. authorities, in collusion with the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang who fled to the United States, used various means to attack and persecute "China Daily News." They instigated special agents, hooligans, and secret agents to beat up readers of "China Daily News" and newsboys who sold the newspaper; they also used the fact that "China Daily News" published notices from two Hong Kong banks telling overseas Chinese how to remit money home as an excuse to sue "China Daily News," attempting to force the newspaper to stop publication.

    美国当局制造无理藉口
    肆意迫害“美洲华侨日报”
    【新华社二十二日讯】纽约消息：美国联邦法院法官西维斯特·瑞安最近以违犯美国币制管理条例为借口，对在纽约出版的华侨报纸“美洲华侨日报”的三个负责人判以为期不等的徒刑，报馆并被处以巨额罚款。美国当局这种对出版事业的摧残和对华侨报纸及其负责人的肆意迫害，再次揭穿了美国政府所标榜的民主自由的假面具。
    美国当局迫害这家维护华侨利益的报纸的活动，早在几年前就已开始。美国当局在和亡命美国的蒋匪帮残余勾结下，使用各种手段，来打击和迫害“美洲华侨日报”。他们唆使特务、流氓、暗探之类殴打“美洲华侨日报”的读者和推销这家报纸的报贩；他们还曾以“美洲华侨日报”登载了香港两家银行告诉华侨用什么方法可以汇款回家的通告为口实，对“美洲华侨日报”进行了控诉，企图迫使这家报纸停止出版。
