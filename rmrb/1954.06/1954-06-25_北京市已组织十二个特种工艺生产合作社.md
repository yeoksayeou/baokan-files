Beijing Has Organized Twelve Special Craft Production Cooperatives
    Beijing's special craft handicraftsmen have established twelve handicraft production cooperatives, including those for carved lacquer, ivory carving, jade carving, enamel, drawnwork embroidery, embroidery, carpets, and other industries. These cooperatives have 780 members, accounting for 16.3 percent of the city's special craft handicraft practitioners.
    After being organized, product sales have expanded and normal production has been guaranteed because products are sold through state-owned companies or processed for state-owned businesses. In terms of production technology, the conservative idea that all operations for special crafts must use manual labor has been broken. Members of the ivory carving production cooperative previously believed that tasks such as splitting materials and polishing had to be done manually. As a result, manual splitting and cutting were very time-consuming and often could not keep up with the demands of carving. Now, six splitting and polishing machines have been purchased with public accumulation funds, and machine efficiency is 40 times higher than manual labor. In the past, because handicraft production was decentralized, each unit had its own system, with no unified standards, making it impossible to improve operations. After being organized, methods such as mutual observation, technical exchange, and comparison are used to improve technology. The carved lacquer production cooperative adopts methods of mutual assistance and cooperation to leverage each individual’s expertise. This not only increases production volume but also utilizes each person’s specialized skills, improving product quality. The carved lacquer production cooperative has also created a double-edged knife, which greatly helps to improve productivity.

    北京市已组织十二个特种工艺生产合作社
    北京市特种工艺手工业者已建成十二个手工业生产合作社，其中包括雕漆、象牙雕刻、玉器雕刻、珐琅、挑补绣、刺绣、地毯等行业，有社员七百八十人，占全市特种工艺手工业从业人数的百分之一十六点三。
    组织起来后，由于产品通过国营公司销售，或给国营商业进行加工，从而扩大了产品销路，保证了正常生产。在生产技术上，打破了认为特种工艺品的一切操作都一定要用手工劳动的保守思想。雕刻象牙生产合作社的社员过去认为劈料、磨光等工作一定要用手工，因此，为了手工劈料、断料费工很大，常常供不上雕刻。现在用公积金购置了六台劈料、磨光机器，用机器比手工提高生产效率四十倍。过去由于手工业生产是分散经营的，因而各搞一套，没有统一的标准，不能改进业务。组织起来后用互相观摩、交流技术、评比等方法来提高技术。雕漆生产合作社采用互助合作的方法，发挥各人的专长，这样不仅可以提高生产量，而且可以发挥各人的专门技术，提高产品质量。雕漆生产合作社还创造了双刃刀，对提高生产率的帮助很大。
