    Each part of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China embodies the spirit of equality, friendship, and mutual assistance among all nationalities within the country. This is a crucial characteristic of our Constitution.
    Our country is a unified multi-ethnic nation. Besides the Han nationality, there are dozens of minority nationalities, residing in concentrated communities, mixed settlements, or scattered across the vast territory. Like the Han nationality, all minority nationalities are diligent and brave. The people of all nationalities, through their hard work and mutual cooperation, have created the history and culture of their respective nationalities and made significant contributions to the creation of our great motherland. However, for a long historical period, because the reactionary ruling class consistently implemented a policy of national oppression, the status of each nationality was unequal, and the suffering of the minority nationalities was even more profound than that of the Han nationality. The establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949 brought about fundamental changes in our country's ethnic relations: the era of national oppression ended, and the era of national equality began. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which served as a provisional constitution, stipulated principles on ethnic policies, guaranteeing that all minority nationalities enjoy rights equal to those of the Han nationality in all aspects. For more than four years, all nationalities in our country have established new friendly and cooperative relations on the basis of equality and voluntariness, achieving great unity among the people of all nationalities, and creating favorable conditions for the country's various construction undertakings. The provisions on ethnic issues in the Draft Constitution are based on the ethnic policies of the Common Program, and summarize and solidify in legislative form the experiences and achievements of ethnic work in the past few years. It further develops the Common Program, guarantees the friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation of all nationalities in the country on the basis of equality, and guarantees that all minority nationalities, in the big family of the motherland, develop their political, economic, and cultural undertakings along with the progress of the country's construction.
    The Draft Constitution points out in its preamble that the great unity of all nationalities in our country is one of the important conditions for realizing the general task of the state during the transition period. Our country is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, which guarantees the elimination of oppression between nationalities and the realization of equality between nationalities. The reason why the hopes of the people of all nationalities in capitalist countries to eliminate national contradictions and conflicts cannot be realized is fundamentally because the ruling bourgeoisie is unwilling to implement a policy of equality for all nationalities, but instead implements a policy of one nationality conquering and oppressing another. For this purpose, the bourgeoisie often uses various means to provoke the relationship between nationalities, causing national contradictions and conflicts to expand. Only a country led by the working class and its vanguard, the Communist Party, can eliminate national oppression, give all nationalities complete equal rights and status, truly resolve national contradictions and conflicts, and achieve solid unity and cooperation among all nationalities. The socialist country of the Soviet Union, for the first time in human history, thoroughly resolved domestic ethnic issues based on the Marxist-Leninist theory of national issues, providing a shining example for multi-ethnic countries around the world.
    Our country is a people's democratic state led by the working class, and the path the Soviet Union took to solve ethnic problems is exactly the path we should and are taking. The general program of our Draft Constitution stipulates: "All nationalities are equal. Discrimination against and oppression of any nationality are prohibited, as are acts undermining the unity of nationalities. All nationalities have the freedom to develop their own languages and scripts, and have the freedom to maintain or reform their own customs and habits and religious beliefs. Regional autonomy is practiced in areas where minority nationalities live in concentrated communities. All national autonomous areas are inseparable parts of the People's Republic of China." These provisions truly solve the ethnic problems in our country, guarantee that the equal rights of minority nationalities are not violated, and guarantee the solid unity of all nationalities. This demonstrates the superiority of our socialist-type constitution, which cannot be compared to the constitution of any capitalist country that practices national oppression.
    According to the provisions of Chapter Two of the Draft Constitution, autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures, and autonomous counties shall be established separately in areas where minority nationalities live in concentrated communities, and national autonomous organs shall be established. The autonomous organs of each nationality shall exercise the power of autonomy within the limits of the Constitution and the law. That is to say, manage the finances of the locality within the limits prescribed by law; organize the local public security forces in accordance with the state's military system; formulate autonomous regulations and separate regulations in accordance with the political, economic and cultural characteristics of the local nationality. These regulations shall have legal effect after being submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for approval. The form of autonomous organs may be prescribed in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the people of the nationality practicing regional autonomy. National regional autonomy is the basic policy of the Chinese Communist Party to solve the national problems in our country by applying Marxism-Leninism. With the implementation of regional autonomy, minority nationalities can truly be masters of their own affairs, making it easier for them to enjoy equal rights; and according to the characteristics of their own nationalities, they can adopt methods and steps acceptable to the people of all nationalities to develop the political, economic and cultural undertakings of their own nationalities. In the past few years, 58 autonomous regions at or above the county level have been established throughout the country. Wherever regional autonomy is implemented, a thriving new atmosphere has emerged. For example, in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the grain output in 1953 exceeded the highest annual output in the past by 25 percent; the number of livestock in 1953 had more than doubled compared with the time of liberation; and cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also developed rapidly.
    Some minority nationality areas, because the area is too small and the population is too small, cannot in fact exercise the power of autonomy, and it is not appropriate to establish autonomous areas and autonomous organs. Therefore, the Draft Constitution stipulates that ethnic townships shall be established in these areas. At the same time, the Constitution guarantees that the people's congresses of each ethnic township "may take specific measures suitable to the characteristics of the nationality within the limits prescribed by law." In multi-ethnic mixed settlements in autonomous areas, nationalities with smaller populations also enjoy equal rights. The Draft Constitution stipulates that in the autonomous organs of these areas, each relevant nationality should have an appropriate number of representatives.
    As a result of the long-term oppression, exploitation, and destruction of minority nationalities by the reactionary ruling class in history, the economic and cultural development of minority nationalities is generally still relatively backward. Therefore, the Draft Constitution stipulates that the superior state organs of the national autonomous organs should not only fully guarantee the exercise of the power of autonomy by each autonomous organ, but also help each minority nationality to develop its political, economic, and cultural construction undertakings. In the past few years, the state has done a lot of work to help minority nationalities develop their economies and cultures: in order to help minority nationalities develop agricultural production, it has issued a large number of agricultural loans and production subsidies to minority nationality areas, and issued free agricultural tools to areas lacking agricultural tools. In the Southwest Region alone, more than 1.3 million pieces of iron agricultural tools were issued in 1953; in order to develop the educational undertakings of minority nationalities, 90.9 billion yuan was allocated for minority nationality education subsidies in 1953, an increase of six times compared with 1951. The state also pays special attention to the health work of minority nationalities. Fifty-one hospitals have been established in minority nationality areas, as well as more than 700 county health centers and more district health stations, epidemic prevention stations, and maternal and child health stations. Last year, the state allocated more than 227 billion yuan for minority nationality health undertakings, more than double the amount of the previous year. Some minority nationality areas have begun to have industries. Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region already has more than 160 state-owned and cooperative factories of various sizes. Xinjiang Province has also newly built some modern factories. Some of the state's key construction projects are located in minority nationality areas. These facts show that the state fully takes into account the needs of all nationalities in developing economic and cultural undertakings. The provisions made in the Draft Constitution now reflect these facts and solidify the state's policy of actively assisting minority nationalities.
    Due to the imbalance in the development of various nationalities in our country, in helping minority nationalities develop economic and cultural construction undertakings, especially in the issue of socialist transformation, we must fully pay attention to all the characteristics of the economic conditions, class structure, and customs and habits in minority nationality areas. We must neither mechanically apply the methods and steps that can be used in Han nationality areas, nor mechanically apply the methods and steps that can be used in a certain minority nationality area to other minority nationality areas with different conditions. Otherwise, it will not only be of no benefit to the work, but will inevitably affect the unity and cooperation between nationalities. Therefore, the preamble to the Draft Constitution also stipulates that "full attention will be paid to the characteristics of the development of each nationality in the issue of socialist transformation." This reform must not only be suitable for the characteristics of the development of the nationality, but must also be decided by the autonomous organs of each national autonomous area in accordance with the will of the majority of the people of the nationality, and take appropriate steps.
    The Draft Constitution specially stipulates in the section on courts: "Citizens of all nationalities have the right to conduct litigation in their own languages and scripts. The people's court shall provide translation for the parties who do not understand the language and script commonly used in the locality. In areas where minority nationalities live in concentrated communities or multi-ethnic mixed settlements, the people's court shall conduct trials in the language commonly used in the locality and issue judgments, proclamations, and other documents in the language commonly used in the locality." This provision also fully demonstrates the care for the rights of citizens of all minority nationalities.
    For more than four years, all nationalities in our country have united into a free and equal national family, and now the Draft Constitution legally guarantees the friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation of all nationalities on the basis of equality. However, it must also be seen that there are still factors hindering national unity: imperialism and its running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, are still trying their best to undermine the unity of our nationalities; the remaining counter-revolutionaries are also constantly looking for opportunities to sow discord; and the ideas of Han chauvinism and local nationalism left over from the era of national oppression still have considerable influence. Therefore, the people of all nationalities throughout the country must always be vigilant against the activities of imperialism and the enemies of the people within each nationality, oppose Han chauvinism and local nationalism, and constantly consolidate and strengthen the unity of our nationalities, jointly realize the general task of the state during the transition period, and build our country into a great socialist country.

### 宪法草案贯彻着民族平等互助的精神

    宪法草案贯彻着民族平等互助的精神
    中华人民共和国宪法草案的各个部分，都贯彻着国内各民族间平等友爱和互助的精神，这是我们宪法的一个极重要的特色。
    我国是一个统一的多民族的国家，除汉族以外，还有几十个少数民族，聚居、杂居或散居在广大的国土上。各个少数民族和汉族一样，都是勤劳勇敢的民族。各民族人民用自己的辛勤劳动和相互间的团结合作，创造了各民族的历史和文化，对我们伟大祖国的缔造都有重要的贡献。但是在过去很长的历史时期中，因为反动统治阶级一直实行着民族压迫政策，各民族的地位是不平等的，少数民族人民的痛苦，较汉族人民更为深重。一九四九年中华人民共和国的成立，使我国的民族关系发生了根本的变化：民族压迫的时代结束了，民族平等的时代开始了。起临时宪法作用的中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领，对于民族政策的规定，保障了各少数民族在各方面享受着和汉族平等的权利。四年多以来，我国各民族已经在平等、自愿的基础上建立了新的友好合作的关系，实现了各民族人民的大团结，给祖国的各项建设创造了有利条件。宪法草案中有关民族问题的规定，就是以共同纲领的民族政策为基础，又把过去几年来民族工作的经验和成果用立法形式总结起来，固定下来，进一步发展了共同纲领，保证了国内各民族在平等基础上的友好、互助、合作，并保证各个少数民族在祖国的大家庭中，随着祖国建设事业的前进，发展其政治、经济和文化的事业。
    宪法草案序言中指出，我国各民族的大团结，是实现国家在过渡时期的总任务的重要条件之一。我们国家是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家，这就保证了消灭民族间的压迫和实现民族间的平等。资本主义国家各族人民关于消除民族矛盾和冲突的希望之所以根本不能实现，就是因为占统治地位的资产阶级不愿意实行各民族一律平等的政策，而实行着一个民族征服和压迫另一个民族的政策。为了这种目的，资产阶级常常用各种手段挑拨各民族的相互关系，使民族之间的矛盾和冲突日益扩大。只有工人阶级和它的先锋队共产党领导的国家，消灭了民族压迫，给各民族以完全平等的权利和地位，才能够真正解决民族间的矛盾和冲突，实现各民族的巩固的团结合作。社会主义国家苏联，在人类历史上第一次根据马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的理论，彻底解决了国内民族问题，给全世界多民族的国家提供了光辉的榜样。
    我国是工人阶级领导的人民民主国家，苏联解决民族问题的道路，也正是我们应该走的和正在走着的道路。我们的宪法草案总纲规定：“各民族一律平等。禁止对任何民族的歧视和压迫，禁止破坏各民族团结的行为。各民族都有发展自己的语言文字的自由，都有保持或者改革自己的风俗习惯和宗教信仰的自由。各少数民族聚居的地方实行区域自治。各民族自治地方都是中华人民共和国不可分离的部分。”这些规定真正解决了我们国内的民族问题，保证了少数民族的平等权利不受侵犯，保证了各民族的巩固的团结。这表明我们社会主义类型的宪法的优越性，是任何实行民族压迫的资本主义国家的宪法所不能比拟的。
    根据宪法草案第二章的规定，在少数民族聚居地区分别建立自治区、自治州、自治县，设立民族自治机关。各民族自治机关按照宪法和法律规定的权限行使自治权。这就是说，按照法律规定的权限管理本地方的财政；按照国家的军事制度组织本地方的公安部队；按照当地民族的政治、经济和文化的特点，制定自治条例和单行条例。这些条例在报请全国人民代表大会常务委员会批准以后，就发生法律效力。自治机关的形式，可以按照实行区域自治的民族大多数人民的意愿规定。民族的区域自治，是中国共产党运用马克思列宁主义解决我国民族问题的基本政策。实行了区域自治，少数民族能够真正当家作主，就更便于享受平等的权利；并根据自己民族的特点，采用各民族人民所能接受的方法和步骤，发展自己民族的政治、经济和文化的事业。几年来全国已经建立了相当于县级和县级以上的自治区五十八个。凡是实行区域自治的地方，都出现了欣欣向荣的新气象。如内蒙古自治区一九五三年的粮食产量已超过以往最高年产量百分之二十五；牲畜头数到一九五三年较解放时已增加了一倍多；文化教育卫生事业也有了飞速的发展。
    有些少数民族聚居地区，因区域太小、人口太少，在事实上不可能行使自治权，不宜建立自治地方和设立自治机关，因此宪法草案规定在这些地区设立民族乡。宪法同时保障各民族乡的人民代表大会“按照法律规定的权限，可以采取适合民族特点的具体措施”。在多民族杂居的自治地方，人口较少的民族也同样一律享受平等的权利。宪法草案规定，在这些地方的自治机关中，各有关民族都应当有适当名额的代表。
    由于历史上反动统治阶级长期对少数民族进行压迫、剥削和摧残的结果，少数民族的经济上、文化上一般还比较落后，因此，宪法草案规定民族自治机关的上级国家机关不仅应当充分保障各自治机关行使自治权，并且要帮助各少数民族发展政治、经济和文化的建设事业。几年来国家为了帮助少数民族发展经济和文化已经作了许多工作：为了帮助少数民族发展农业生产，对少数民族地区发放了大量的农业贷款和生产补助金，并对缺乏农具的地区发放了无偿农具，仅西南区在一九五三年就发放了一百三十多万件铁质农具；为了发展少数民族的教育事业，一九五三年拨给了少数民族教育补助费九百零九亿元，比一九五一年增加了六倍。国家对少数民族的卫生工作也特别关怀，在少数民族地区已建立五十一所医院，建立了七百多个县卫生院和更多的区卫生所、防疫站和妇幼保健站。去年国家拨给少数民族卫生事业补助费达两千二百七十多亿元，比前年增加了一倍多。有些少数民族地区已开始有了工业，内蒙古自治区已有地方国营和合作社经营的大小工厂一百六十多个，新疆省也新建了一些现代化的工厂。国家基本建设的重点工程有的就在少数民族地区。这些事实说明了国家在发展经济、文化事业中充分照顾了各民族的需要。现在宪法草案中所作的规定正是反映了这种事实，把国家这种积极帮助少数民族的政策固定下来。
    由于我国各民族发展的不平衡，在帮助少数民族发展经济、文化的建设事业中，特别是在社会主义改造的问题上，必须充分注意少数民族地区的经济状况、阶级结构和风俗习惯上的一切特点，既不能机械搬用在汉族地区可用的方法和步骤，也不能机械地把在某一少数民族地区可用的方法、步骤搬用到情况不同的其他少数民族地区去。否则不仅对工作毫无益处，而且必然影响民族间的团结合作。因此宪法草案序言又规定了“在社会主义改造的问题上将充分注意各民族发展的特点”。这种改革不只是必须适合本民族发展的特点，而且必须由各民族自治地方的自治机关根据本民族大多数人民的意志去作决定，并采取妥善的步骤。
    宪法草案中在关于法院的部分特别规定：“各民族公民都有用本民族语言文字进行诉讼的权利。人民法院对于不通晓当地通用的语言文字的当事人，应当为他们翻译。在少数民族聚居或者多民族杂居的地区，人民法院应当用当地通用的语言进行审讯，用当地通用的文字发布判决书、布告和其他文件。”这个规定也充分表现了对各少数民族的公民的权利的照顾。
    四年多以来，我国各民族已经团结成为一个自由平等的民族大家庭，现在宪法草案又用法律保证了各民族在平等基础上的友好、互助、合作。但是还必须看到：目前妨碍民族团结的因素仍然存在：帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮仍然在千方百计地破坏我们各民族的团结；残余的反革命分子也无时不在寻找机会进行挑拨离间；民族压迫时代所遗留下来的大民族主义和地方民族主义的思想还有相当的影响。因此全国各民族人民必须时刻警惕帝国主义和各民族内部的人民公敌的活动，反对大民族主义和地方民族主义，不断地巩固和加强我国各民族的团结，共同实现国家在过渡时期的总任务，把我们国家建成为伟大的社会主义国家。
