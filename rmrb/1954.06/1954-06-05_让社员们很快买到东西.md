    Let Members Buy Things Quickly
    By Our Correspondent　Wen Ying
    Whether in cities or in the countryside, cooperatives have become an indispensable part of people's lives. But people have a common feeling: it's too crowded, and it's really not easy to buy things.
    Let's take the Xidan branch of the Beijing Cooperative General Corporation's Second Business Department as an example. The area here is only fifty-odd square meters, but seven or eight thousand members come in to buy things every day; when it comes to Sundays and holidays, there are even more people buying things: some want to buy fruit and dried fruit, some buy pastries and canned goods, and some want to buy smoked meat and smoked chicken... The counters are always surrounded by rows and rows of members, all hoping to buy things quickly. And the salespersons are constantly busy, having to weigh each item one by one and then wrap it up. According to the members' experience, it takes half an hour from entering the door to buying something.
    Due to the busy work, the salespersons naturally can't pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene. The flower-tiled floor of the store is full of dirt and banana and orange peels; the fruit section's floor is littered with fruit; the salespersons selling pastries and cooked food don't even bother to wear work clothes or use pastry tongs to pick up pastries; the glass cabinets inside, containing food, are always covered with a layer of dust.
    What to do? The salespersons had thought of many solutions, such as letting the members line up to buy things in order. However, as soon as they saw the long queues, and having to wait for a long time, they simply turned around and didn't buy anything. They also tried to pull out the accounting cashiers and union cadres to work at the counters, and also transferred people from other cooperatives to help, but many people were not familiar with the business, just bumping around inside the counter, making the work seem even more chaotic.
    The salespersons then devoted themselves to studying the situation again, learned from the Soviet experience, and finally came up with a good way to improve sales. They pre-packaged more than a hundred kinds of goods into paper packages according to different weights, and implemented piece-rate sales. In this way, the salesperson could hand over the goods with one hand and collect the money with the other; time was also greatly saved. In the past, selling one item took an average of thirty seconds each time, but now it only takes three seconds, increasing work efficiency by nine times. As for fruit, it is difficult to sell it pre-packaged, because if you package it today, and open it tomorrow to take a look, you may find it rotten, and the weight will also decrease. Therefore, they decided to continue to adopt the "weighing and selling on the spot" method. But now, instead of using hand-held scales, they use platform scales to weigh apples, because hand-held scales are slow and laborious, and on average they can only weigh fifty-three times in half an hour. If you use a platform scale, it is both quick and easy. The salesperson only needs to put the fruit on the plate, put it on the platform scale, and you can immediately know the weight. In half an hour, you can weigh eighty-two times.
    The phenomenon of salespersons being busy and chaotic has been overcome. They not only have time to study and research work, but also can free up six people to do other work: three people are specifically responsible for packaging goods, and the other three go to help other units; in the event of special holiday crowds, just adding a few people can cope.
    Now, as soon as people enter the store, they feel that it has changed. They can buy things quickly. The flower-tiled floor is cleaned so bright and smooth, the salespersons often wear work clothes and masks, and use clean tongs to clip pastries; the goods are displayed in an orderly manner, the white porcelain plates in the pastry and cooked food section are wiped so clean, and the various biscuits in the canned wine section are arranged very delicately; the dried fruit section hangs various sample boxes, all marked with unit prices, and you can buy lychees from Guangdong, raisins from Turpan, Xinjiang, melon slices from Hami, Xinjiang... at any time.

### 让社员们很快买到东西

    让社员们很快买到东西
    本报记者　文英
    无论在城市里或农村中，合作社已成为人民生活中不可缺少的东西。但人们有一个共同的感觉：人太拥挤，要把东西买到手实在不容易。
    拿北京市合作总社第二经理部的西单门市部来做个例子吧。这儿的面积只有五十多平方公尺，每天却有七、八千个社员进去买东西；逢到星期日和节日，买东西的人就更多：有的要买水果、干果，有的买糕点、罐头，有的要买熏肉熏鸡……。柜台前总是围着一排一排的社员，他们都希望很快就买到东西。而售货员们整天应接不暇，他们得把一样一样的东西称一称，然后把它包起来。根据社员们的经验，从进门到买到东西，总得半个小时。
    由于工作忙，售货员们自然就谈不上注意清洁卫生了。门市部的花砖地上，堆满了泥土和香蕉、桔子皮；水果部地上掉满了水果；卖糕点、熟食的售货员，工作服也顾不得穿，也不用点心夹子撮拿点心；里面放着食品的玻璃柜上总是蒙着一层土。
    怎么办呢？售货员们曾想过很多的解决办法，例如，让社员们排队按着次序去买东西。可是，他们一看到队伍排得老长，一等就得好半天，就干脆回头不买了。也曾把会计出纳、工会干部一起抽出来上柜台，又到其他的合作社调人来帮忙，但是许多人不熟悉业务，只是在柜台内碰来碰去，工作显得更加忙乱了。
    售货员们又专心研究了一番，学习了苏联的经验，终于想出了一个改进售货的好办法。他们预先把一百多种商品，按不同分量包成纸包，实行计件出售。这样，售货员就可以一手交货，一手收钱；时间也大大地节省了，过去出卖一件物品每次总得三十秒钟，现在只需三秒钟的时间，提高了工作效率九倍。至于水果，要包起来卖就困难了，如果今天把它包起来，明天打开来看看，有时会发现腐烂的，而且分量也减少了。于是他们决定仍采取“现称现卖”的办法。可是现在不用手提秤而改用台秤来称苹果，因为手提秤的效率慢又费劲，平均每半小时只能称五十三次。如果用台秤，既迅速又省劲，售货员只要把水果装在盘里，在台秤上一放，就能马上知道重量，半小时就能称八十二次。
    售货员工作忙乱的现象克服了。他们不仅有时间进行学习，研究工作，还可以抽出六个人来做别的工作：三个人专管包装商品的工作，另外三个人去帮其他单位；在节日特别拥挤的情况下，只要增添几个人就能应付。
    现在，人们一进门市部，就感到变了样，他们可以很快地买到东西。花砖地打扫得又光又滑，售货员都经常穿上工作服，带上口罩，用洁净的夹子夹点心；商品陈列得井井有条，糕点部、熟食部的白瓷盘擦得那么洁净，罐头酒类部的各种饼干摆得很精致；干果部挂着各种样品匣子，上面都标上了单位价格，你随时可买到广东的荔枝干、新疆吐鲁蕃的葡萄干、新疆哈密的瓜干……
