Xinhua News Agency, Jinan. Double-shared plows manufactured by the Shandong Farm Implement Factory, a local state-owned enterprise, are popular among farmers. This spring, the factory manufactured more than two thousand double-shared plows and promptly transported them to Liaocheng, Huimin, Laiyang, Jiaozhou, Linyi and other special districts in Shandong Province to supply farmers' spring plowing production. Farmers in these areas used double-shared plows for plowing, which greatly improved production efficiency compared to using old-fashioned plows. You Deming, a farmer from Gongjia Township, Sixth District, Jiaoxian County, wrote a letter to the factory saying: "Using the double-shared plow you manufactured to plow the land saves both labor and effort and plows deeper. It saves six animal power and three human power every day, and is three times faster than old-fashioned farm implements." The Guo Zhanyi Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Ninth District of Guangrao County also wrote: "After our cooperative used the double-shared plow for plowing, it further increased the members' confidence in increasing grain production." Since this spring, the Shandong Farm Implement Factory has received more than 30 letters from farmers in various places, expressing their love for the double-shared plow. Currently, according to statistics from supply and marketing cooperatives across Shandong Province, farmers throughout the province still need to purchase more than 13,000 double-shared plows.

From this spring to now, the Shandong Farm Implement Factory has further improved the quality of double-shared plows based on farmers' opinions. For example, the plow handle of the previously manufactured double-shared plow was flat, which was inconvenient to use. According to farmers' opinions, it was changed to a round plow handle. Previously, the drawbar of the double-shared plow was made of a single layer of iron plate. Farmers pointed out that it was easy to twist and deform during use. Now it has been changed to two layers of iron plates riveted together to strengthen the firmness of the drawbar. In the past, the hardness of the plowshare was inconsistent, and some were not hard enough and not wear-resistant when plowing. After farmers raised this issue, the Shandong Farm Implement Factory specially added a hardness tester to ensure that the hardness of the currently manufactured plowshare meets the standards. During this year's spring plowing, the factory sent technicians to the countryside to understand the farmers' use of double-shared plows, collect farmers' opinions on improving the double-shared plows, and teach farmers how to use and maintain the double-shared plows. In addition to improving product quality, the Shandong Farm Implement Factory has also made efforts in saving raw materials and improving production efficiency, so that the price of a double-shared plow has been reduced from 1.56 million yuan last year to 1.17 million yuan now. Currently, the factory is increasing machinery and equipment and increasing production to meet the needs of the vast number of farmers.

    双铧犁在山东受到广大农民欢迎
    山东农具厂根据农民意见改进犁的质量
    【新华社济南讯】地方国营山东农具厂制造的双铧犁受到广大农民的欢迎。今年春季，这个工厂制造了两千多部双铧犁，及时运往山东省聊城、惠民、莱阳、胶州、临沂等专区供应农民春耕生产。这些地区的农民使用双铧犁耕地，比用旧式犁大大提高了生产效率。胶县六区巩家乡的农民由德明给工厂写信说：“使用你们制造的双铧犁耕地，又省力又耕得深，每天能省六个畜力和三个人力，比旧式农具快三倍。”广饶县九区郭占一农业生产合作社也写信说：“我们社里使用双铧犁耕地后，更加提高了社员们增产粮食的信心。”山东农具厂从今年春季以来，收到各地农民来信三十多封，信中表示出农民对双铧犁的喜爱。目前，据山东省各地供销合作社的统计，全省农民还需要购买双铧犁一万三千多部。
    山东农具厂从今年春季到现在，根据农民的意见，进一步改进了双铧犁的质量。例如以前制造的双铧犁，犁把是扁形的，使用不便，根据农民意见，便改成辊圆形的犁把。以前双铧犁拉杆是用一层铁板做成的，农民提出使用时容易扭弯变形，现在已改用两层铁板铆在一起，加强了拉杆的坚固性。过去犁铧的硬度不一样，有的硬度不够，耕地时不抗磨，农民提出这方面的意见后，山东农具厂特增设了硬度检验器，使现在制造的犁铧硬度都够标准。在今年春耕当中，这个工厂曾派技术员下乡，了解农民使用双铧犁的情况，搜集农民对改进双铧犁的意见，并教给农民使用和保养双铧犁的方法。除改进产品质量外，山东农具厂并从节约原材料和提高生产效率等方面作了努力，使双铧犁的价格，由去年一百五十六万元一部降低到现在一百一十七万元就可买一部。目前，这个厂正在增加机器设备，提高产量，以适应广大农民的需要。
