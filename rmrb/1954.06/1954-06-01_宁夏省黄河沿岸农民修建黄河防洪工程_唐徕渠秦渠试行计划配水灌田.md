Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan: Farmers in areas along the Yellow River in Jinji, Lingwu, Dengkou, Zhongning, Zhongwei, Ningshuo, Pingluo, and Taole counties of Ningxia Province are actively building Yellow River flood control projects. This year, these areas will newly build and repair 19,000 meters of flood control dikes, 66 sections of flood control ?, and 121 spillway dams and grass-stone dams. The entire project requires 123,000 cubic meters of earthwork and stonework. After these projects are completed, in addition to the flood control projects done in the past few years, the safety of farmland and the lives and property of farmers in Pingluo, Lingwu, Dengkou and other counties on both sides of the Yellow River can be guaranteed even if the Yellow River flow increases sevenfold compared to the present.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan: The Water Conservancy Bureau of the People's Government of Ningxia Province is piloting a planned water allocation system for irrigation in the Tanglai Canal and Qin Canal this year. The 400,000 mu of wheat fields within the irrigation areas of the two major canals had their first watering completed by May 18. After irrigation, the wheat seedlings are growing vigorously. According to the old irrigation habits, Qin Canal used to require a water volume of 17 cubic meters per second for wheat field irrigation. After the pilot planned water allocation irrigation, only 14 cubic meters per second of water was used. In the irrigation area below the Ximen Bridge in Yinchuan City on the Tanglai Canal, the water demand for irrigating wheat fields this year was reduced by one-fifth compared to last year. This year, Ningxia Province is piloting planned water allocation irrigation based on the water demand of crops in the Tanglai Canal and Qin Canal, gradually changing farmers' habits of excessive irrigation, playing a significant role in preventing soil alkalization, and creating conditions for increasing crop production.

    宁夏省黄河沿岸农民修建黄河防洪工程
    唐徕渠秦渠试行计划配水灌田
    【新华社银川讯】宁夏省金积、灵武、磴口、中宁、中卫、宁朔、平罗、陶乐等县沿黄河两岸地区的农民，正在积极修建黄河防洪工程。这些地区今年将新修和补修防洪堤一万九千公尺，防洪?六十六段，溢洪坝和草石坝一百二十一座，全部工程需做土方和石方十二万三千公方。这些工程完成后，加上过去几年所做的防洪工程，就是在黄河流量比现在增加七倍的情况下，仍可使黄河两岸的农田和平罗、灵武、磴口等县农民的生命财产的安全得到保证。
    【新华社银川讯】宁夏省人民政府水利局今年在唐徕渠和秦渠试行计划配水灌田。两大干渠灌溉区内的四十万亩麦田，到五月十八日已灌完头遍水。灌溉后，麦苗生长茂盛。按照旧有的灌溉习惯，过去秦渠要有十七秒立方公尺的水量才够麦田灌溉，试行计划配水灌溉后，只用了十四秒立方公尺的水量。唐徕渠的银川市西门桥以下的灌溉区内，今年灌溉麦田的需水量比去年减少了五分之一。今年宁夏省在唐徕渠和秦渠按农作物需水量试行计划配水灌溉，逐渐改变了农民过量灌水的习惯，对防止土地碱化起很大作用，也为农田增产创造了条件。
