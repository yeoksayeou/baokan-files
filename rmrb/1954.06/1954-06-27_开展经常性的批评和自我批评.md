    Conducting Regular Criticism and Self-Criticism
    Chen Yunpeng, Deputy Secretary of the Communist Party of China Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs Committee

    Criticism and self-criticism are among the most important elements of democratic life within the Party. Conducting criticism and self-criticism is an important aspect of the Party organization's leadership methods in the current construction of a socialist society. Correctly conducting criticism and self-criticism can not only correct any deviations that may occur in the implementation of policies in their infancy, but also enhance the work enthusiasm, initiative, and political responsibility of Party members, cultivate in them the ideological style of being modest, sincere, unafraid of exposing shortcomings and mistakes, and being able to earnestly correct shortcomings and mistakes, thereby preventing and reducing deviations in work. Therefore, Party organizations at all levels and all Party members must attach greater importance to conducting criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from below. The Party organizations and most Party members of the Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs generally pay attention to conducting criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from below. At the two Party Congresses of the Provincial Direct Organs, carrying out criticism and self-criticism and fighting against all unhealthy tendencies was put forward as an important resolution. At the Second Party Congress, the experiences of the Provincial United Cooperative and the Postal and Telecommunications Bureau branch committees in carrying out criticism and self-criticism were also introduced, the existing problems in carrying out criticism and self-criticism in the Provincial Direct Organs were summarized, and suggestions for improvement were put forward. This greatly promoted and inspired Party organizations and Party members to further attach importance to carrying out criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from below. Branches such as the Songjiang Daily editorial department, the Provincial United Cooperative, and the Education Department can conscientiously summarize the ideology of Party members over a period of time, find out the main and common problems, and launch discussions, analysis, and criticism to improve their thinking and promote their work. However, similar practices of these branches are still not many in the Party organizations of the Provincial Direct Organs. Some Party organizations, although able to carry out criticism and self-criticism, are limited to a certain time or event, and cannot make criticism and self-criticism regular. Often, when a movement comes or the higher Party committee emphasizes this issue, the Party organization becomes nervous for a while, and then everything is "fine and dandy" and "calm and tranquil." In addition, some Party members treat criticism and self-criticism with a formalistic attitude. After others criticize them, they also express their willingness to accept it modestly, but afterward they do not actively correct it, and even repeat similar mistakes, and review themselves in the same way. This shows that without regular criticism and self-criticism, it is impossible to help some comrades thoroughly correct their shortcomings or mistakes.

    How can we make criticism and self-criticism regular? Judging from the situation of the Party organizations of the Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs, the following issues must be resolved:

    First, we must make everyone fully aware of the important significance of conducting regular criticism and self-criticism. One of the characteristics of the Communist Party's criticism and self-criticism is its regularity. Stalin pointed out: "Some comrades believe that self-criticism is a fleeting phenomenon, a fad that will soon pass like any ordinary fad—these comrades are completely wrong. In fact, self-criticism is an integral and frequently used weapon in the arsenal of Bolshevism, a weapon that is inextricably linked to the very nature of Bolshevism, to its revolutionary spirit." (Stalin: "Against Vulgarizing the Slogan of Self-Criticism") From this, it can be seen that criticism and self-criticism are a weapon that every Communist Party member carries with them and a tool that is frequently used. But we have not done this. In our daily work, we rarely use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to check for problems in our work. Often, it is only when serious mistakes have occurred in our work and the cause of the Party and the people has suffered losses that we carry out criticism and self-criticism. When mistakes are still in their infancy, we rarely launch criticism and expose mistakes. We easily overlook things in their infancy, thinking that they are small mistakes and do not matter. This idea is wrong, because a person's mistakes do not happen suddenly, but often develop gradually from small to large. Therefore, conducting regular criticism and self-criticism is also an effective method to prevent small shortcomings or mistakes from growing and spreading.

    Second, timely research and resolution of various ideological concerns are the prerequisites for conducting regular criticism and self-criticism. A portion of the Party members in the Provincial Direct Organs have the following ideological concerns about carrying out criticism and self-criticism.

    Some people believe that carrying out criticism will hurt feelings, lose harmony, and make it awkward to meet, so they adopt a liberal attitude of accommodating and forgiving the shortcomings and mistakes of comrades. Some people say: "Leave half of what you want to say unsaid," "It's better to do less than more," "Just muddle through, who doesn't have some shortcomings and mistakes." This idea is wrong. One of the characteristics of the Communist Party's criticism and self-criticism is upholding principles and disregarding sentiment. The principle of criticism is the interests of the Party and the people, and this concern is a manifestation of individualism that places personal interests above the interests of the Party and the people. At the Fifteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Comrade Stalin criticized this mistake of abandoning principled criticism because of unwillingness to "make enemies." He said: "It is also often seen that some people use the so-called attitude of personal affection, using family methods to solve problems. For example, Zhang San, a member of the upper-level leading body of an organization, made a very crude mistake and messed things up. But Li Si is unwilling to criticize him, unwilling to expose his mistakes, unwilling to correct his mistakes. The reason for not wanting to do this is because he is unwilling to 'make enemies.' What does it matter if he makes a mistake and messes things up! Who among us doesn't make mistakes! Today I forgive him, this Zhang San, and tomorrow he will forgive me, this Li Si. You must know that I myself cannot guarantee that I will not make mistakes! How good it is to settle things peacefully, both dignified and harmonious." And he pointed out: "If we abandon self-criticism for the sake of the peace of mind of some comrades, then we will get nothing but the destruction of our great cause, isn't this very obvious?" Therefore, it is necessary to educate Party members to overcome this individualism and liberalism. If this individualism and liberalism are allowed to exist, it will not only fail to expose shortcomings or mistakes in work in a timely manner, but also affect the unity of the Party. Because these comrades do not have the courage to criticize formally, they often gossip behind their backs, forming small broadcasting stations.

    Some people believe that being criticized will lose face and prestige, so they cannot humbly and sincerely accept the opinions of others. When dealing with criticism, they often do not focus on considering the basic content of the criticism, often excessively emphasize the attitude, method, and discretion of others when criticizing themselves, and often use the excuse that others' attitudes are bad, the discretion is inappropriate, and the facts are not well-founded to reject criticism. This is very wrong and is contrary to the spirit of "correct mistakes if you have them, and be encouraged if you don't," "say everything you know, and say it all," and "the speaker is not guilty, but the listener should take warning" that Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly taught us to adopt when dealing with criticism and self-criticism. We should recognize that the main purpose of criticism is to correct our shortcomings or mistakes and better promote the cause of the Party and the people. Therefore, for any well-intentioned criticism, even if the critic has some shortcomings or is not completely correct in attitude, method, discretion, and factual basis, we should take a welcoming attitude, accept the correct parts in a realistic manner, and patiently and sincerely explain and clarify the facts for incorrect or untrue criticisms. This is the attitude that a Communist Party member should have towards criticism and self-criticism. Of course, for critics, they should strive for accurate facts, appropriate discretion, and pay attention to the attitude of criticism, so that the other party can easily accept it.

    Third, closely combining with daily work is an important method for conducting regular criticism and self-criticism. It can not only enable every Party member to grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism at any time and any place to check for shortcomings or mistakes, thereby improving and enhancing their work, but also enable every Party member to develop a good habit of criticism and self-criticism, making them truly feel that criticism and self-criticism are indispensable weapons in daily work. To this end, Party organizations must pay attention to solving the following issues:

    Be good at understanding and studying the ideological situation of Party members and problems in implementing policies and completing tasks through various forms and methods. Because only by grasping these situations can the Party organization's criticism and struggle against unhealthy tendencies have a basis and be targeted. Party members should actively report to the branch on their ideological, work, and policy implementation situations; Party organizations should also actively understand this aspect of the situation through various forms and methods (holding small forums, individual talks, Party group meetings, and inquiring about people's letters, etc.), and then analyze and study it. In this way, it is possible to grasp the main and common problems existing in the ideology and work of Party member cadres in each period, and direct the edge of criticism and self-criticism to this aspect, avoiding using criticism and self-criticism only to solve some trivial matters in life.

    After the Party organization has grasped the main and common problems existing among Party members, it should analyze and criticize these problems and put forward improvement suggestions, then convey them to Party members and call on Party members to conduct self-examination in connection with themselves. Over the past year, we have realized that this is the most effective method for solving the problems existing among Party members. In the first quarter of 1954, the Party Committee of the Provincial Direct Organs comprehensively studied the main problems existing among Party member cadres in the organs, and then convened a meeting of general branch members, branch members, and group leaders, and a Party member meeting, where the Party Committee Secretary made a report. After the meeting, the general branches and branches organized Party members to conduct discussions, and most Party members conducted self-examination in connection with themselves. As a result, it has been of great help in solving the current problems existing among some Party member cadres in the Provincial Direct Organs in terms of work, ideology, and policy implementation.

    When carrying out criticism and self-criticism, it is particularly important to emphasize criticism from below. The Party organizations of the Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs have initially paid attention to carrying out criticism from below. At the two Party Congresses of the Provincial Direct Organs, not only was the important significance of carrying out criticism from below particularly emphasized, but also some necessary measures were stipulated, such as strictly enforcing the organizational life of administrative responsible cadres, so as to carry out criticism and self-criticism in a timely manner. Last year, we also organized Party members to study the incident of Huang Yifeng suppressing criticism published in the People's Daily, and conducted self-examination and criticism in connection with ourselves. In daily work, we also paid attention to checking the situation of carrying out criticism from below, and struggled against the situation of individual leading cadres suppressing criticism and suppressing democracy. As a result, criticism from below has been greatly carried out. Party member cadres with administrative responsibilities can generally attend various Party meetings on time, listen to the criticism of Party members, and can also listen to the opinions of the masses in daily work. For example, after the Songjiang Daily published a reader's report exposing that the Tangyuan County Coal Construction Company reported inaccurate achievements to the Provincial Department of Commerce and criticizing Comrade Guan Zhou, the Director of the Department of Commerce, Comrade Guan Zhou seriously reviewed his leadership responsibility in the newspaper. However, there are still individual Party member cadres with administrative leadership responsibilities in the Provincial Direct Organs who lack the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. Although they also talk about the importance of criticism and self-criticism in words, they are not satisfied when Party members below criticize them. This is the case with a Deputy Governor of the Provincial People's Bank. In the second quarter of 1953, the department store wholesale station and some enterprises submitted articles to the Songjiang Daily, criticizing the bank for reducing cash quotas, which affected the wholesale station's purchase of goods and the capital turnover of some enterprises. The newspaper urged the bank to conduct a review. When the branch transferred the materials to him, he said: "You (the branch) tell the newspaper that I am unwilling to review." The branch conducted a serious struggle against his erroneous behavior of resisting criticism, and conducted two consecutive criticisms at the enlarged meeting of the branch committee. For example, a cadre of the Provincial Highway Bureau made several critical suggestions to the leadership, and the leadership dismissed the cadre on the pretext. Judging from these situations, some administrative responsible comrades do not take a welcoming attitude towards criticism from the masses, but rather have a resistant emotion. Therefore, when someone criticizes them, they always try to find reasons to cover up their wrong behavior and counterattack others. Such fear of criticism by leaders not only fails to correct shortcomings and mistakes in work in a timely manner, but also suppresses the enthusiasm and initiative of Party members. At the Nineteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Malenkov pointed out: "At present, it is particularly important to ensure the development of self-criticism and criticism from below, and to treat those who hinder the development of criticism of our shortcomings, suppress criticism, and persecute and retaliate against critics as deadly enemies of the Party, and wage a ruthless struggle against them." "Staff members who cannot develop the work of criticism and self-criticism are obstacles to our progress, they have not yet matured enough to be leaders, and they cannot expect the trust of the Party." Those leaders who are afraid of criticism and afraid of exposing shortcomings or mistakes should better face this point squarely in order to correct the wrong attitude adopted towards criticism. At the same time, the Party organization must give support and encouragement to criticism from below, so that critics feel that their opinions will be taken seriously, and that they will not be attacked or retaliated against for criticizing leaders, or even if they are attacked or retaliated against, they will have the support of the Party. In this way, they can criticize the shortcomings of anyone, especially the leaders, without any scruples.

    In order to better carry out criticism from below, the Party organization must also educate Party members to overcome various erroneous views. Some people believe that criticizing leaders will make leaders have a bad view of themselves, and are afraid of being attacked, retaliated against, and affecting promotion, etc. These ideas are wrong. Because they do not put the interests of the Party and the people above personal interests, but first consider personal gains and losses. Therefore, the Party organization must educate every Party member so that they can resolutely subordinate personal interests to the interests of the Party, criticize the shortcomings or mistakes of anyone without regard for sentiment, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against principled shortcomings or mistakes.

    In order to better carry out criticism and self-criticism, the Party organization must also promptly commend those Party members who dare to face up to their shortcomings and mistakes, and at the same time educate everyone not to take a discriminatory attitude towards Party members with shortcomings or mistakes, but should actively and earnestly help them to quickly correct their shortcomings or mistakes. Only in this way can criticism and self-criticism be used to achieve the purpose of treating illnesses and saving people.

    开展经常性的批评和自我批评
    中共松江省直属机关委员会副书记　陈云鹏
    批评与自我批评是党内民主生活最重要的内容之一。开展批评与自我批评是目前建设社会主义社会中党组织领导方法中的一个重要环节。正确地开展批评与自我批评不但可以使我们在执行政策中可能发生的偏差在萌芽状态中就得到纠正，而且能够提高党员的工作积极性、主动性和政治责任感，培养他们虚心诚恳不怕暴露缺点错误并能认真地改正缺点和错误的思想作风，从而防止和减少工作中的偏差。因此，党的各级组织及全体党员必须更加重视开展批评与自我批评特别是自下而上的批评。松江省直属机关党的组织以及大部分党员一般是注意开展批评与自我批评特别是自下而上的批评的。在省直属机关的两届党员代表大会上，都把开展批评与自我批评向一切不良倾向进行斗争做为一项重要的决议提出。在第二届党员代表大会上还介绍了省联合社、邮电局支部委员会关于开展批评与自我批评的经验，总结了省直属机关在开展批评与自我批评方面存在的问题，提出了改进的意见。这样就大大地推动和启发了党组织和党员更进一步的重视开展批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评。松江日报编辑部、省联合社、教育厅等支部都能认真地总结一个时期的党员思想，从中找出主要的带普遍性的问题展开讨论、分析、批判，提高了思想，推动了工作。但类似这些支部的做法，在省直属机关党的组织中还是不多的。有的党组织虽然能够开展批评与自我批评，但只限于一时或一事，而不能把批评与自我批评经常化，往往是当一个运动来了以后，或上级党委强调这个问题时，党组织就紧张一阵，过后就“万事大吉”、“风平浪静”。此外，还有些党员以形式主义的态度来对待批评与自我批评，当别人对他提出批评之后，他也表示虚心接受，但过后却并不积极地改正，甚至重犯类似的错误，再照样检讨。这就表明没有经常性地批评与自我批评，就无法帮助一些同志彻底地改正缺点或错误。
    怎样才能使批评与自我批评经常化呢？从松江省直属机关党组织的情况看，必须解决以下几个问题：
    第一、必须使大家充分认识开展经常性批评与自我批评的重要意义。共产党的批评与自我批评的特点之一，就是它的经常性。斯大林指出：“一些同志认为自我批评是转瞬过去的现象，是一种时髦品，它与普通任何时髦品一样一定很快就会过时的，——这些同志是完全错了。其实自我批评是布尔什维主义武库中不可分割的和经常运用的武器，这个武器与布尔什维主义底性质本身、与它的革命精神是不可分离地联系着的。”（斯大林：“反对把自我批评口号庸俗化”）由此可见，批评与自我批评，是共产党员随身携带的一种武器和经常使用的工具。但我们没有这样做，在日常工作中很少以批评与自我批评的武器去检查工作中的问题，往往是当工作中有了严重错误，党和人民的事业已经遭受到损失的时候才去开展批评和自我批评，而当错误还在萌芽的时候，我们却很少展开批评和揭发错误。我们很容易忽略了萌芽状态的东西，认为这是小错误，是不要紧的。这种想法是不对的，因为一个人的错误都不是突然发生的，常常是由小到大逐渐发展起来的。因此，开展经常性的批评与自我批评也是防微杜渐不使小的缺点或错误滋长和蔓延的有效方法。
    第二、及时研究解决各种思想顾虑是开展经常性的批评与自我批评的先决条件。省直属机关中有
  一部分党员对开展批评与自我批评存在着以下几种思想顾虑。
    有些人认为开展批评会伤感情，失掉和气，见面不好意思，因而对同志们的缺点错误采取迁就原谅的自由主义态度。有的人说：“话到嘴边留半句”、“多一事不如少一事”、“马马虎虎就过去了，谁还没有点缺点和错误呢”。这种思想是不对的。共产党的批评与自我批评的特点之一，就是坚持原则和不顾情面。批评的原则性就是党和人民的利益，而这种顾虑正是把私人利益置于党和人民利益之上的一种个人主义思想。斯大林同志在联共（布）第十五次代表大会上就指责了这种因为不愿“树敌”而放弃原则性批评的错误。他说：“也往往看见有人用所谓讲私人感情的态度，用家庭办法来解决问题。譬如说，身为某个组织上层领导机关委员的张三犯了极粗暴的错误，弄坏了事情。但李四却不肯去批评他，不肯去揭露他的错误，不肯去纠正他的错误。其所以不愿这样去做，是因为不愿“树敌”。犯了错误，弄坏了事情，这有什么要紧！我们中间谁人不犯错误呀！今天我宽恕他这个张三，明天他就会宽恕我这个李四。须知，我自己也不能担保不犯错误啊！和平了事多么好，既体面，又和气。”并且指出：“如果我们为了某些同志底安宁而放弃自我批评，那末除了使我们伟大事业陷于灭亡而外就得不到什么旁的结果，这难道还不很明显吗？”因此，必须教育党员克服这种个人主义和自由主义思想。如果允许这种个人主义和自由主义思想存在，不但不能及时地揭发工作中的缺点或错误，而且影响党的团结。因为这些同志没有正式批评的勇气，往往就好背后议论，形成小广播。
    有些人认为受了批评就会失掉面子，失掉威信，因而不能虚心诚意地接受别人的意见。他们在对待批评时往往不注重考虑别人批评的基本内容，常常过分强调别人批评自己时的态度、方式和分寸，常常以别人态度不好、分寸不当为借口来拒绝批评。这是很不对的，是和毛泽东同志屡次教导我们对待批评与自我批评应采取的“有则改之，无则加勉”，“知无不言，言无不尽”，“言者无罪，闻者足戒”的精神相违背的。我们应当认识到批评的主要目的，是为了纠正我们的缺点或错误，更好地把党和人民的事业推向前进。因此，对于任何善意的批评，即使批评者在态度上、方式、分寸以及事实根据上有些缺点或者不完全正确，我们也应该抱着欢迎的态度，实事求是地接受正确的部分，对不正确的或不符合事实的批评，则耐心地、诚恳地把事实真相加以解释和说明，这才是一个共产党员对待批评与自我批评应有的态度。当然，对于批评者来说，是应该力求事实确切、分寸恰当，并且注意批评的态度，以便对方容易接受。
    第三、紧紧的与日常工作相结合，是开展经常性批评与自我批评的重要方法。它不但可以使每个党员都能随时随地掌握批评与自我批评的武器来检查缺点或错误，从而改进和提高工作，而且也能够使每个党员养成批评与自我批评的良好习惯，使他们真正感到批评与自我批评是日常工作中不可缺少的武器。为此党组织就必须注意解决以下几个问题：
    要善于通过各种形式和方法了解和研究党员思想情况以及在执行政策完成任务等方面的问题。因为只有掌握住这些情况，党组织开展批评向不良倾向进行斗争才能有所依据，才能作到有的放矢。党员应该主动地向支部汇报自己在思想上、工作上以及执行政策等方面的情况；党的组织也要通过各种形式和方法（召开小型座谈会，个别谈话，党的小组会以及询问人民来信部门等）主动地了解这方面的情况，然后加以分析，研究。这样就能够抓住每个时期党员干部思想和工作中存在的主要的和带普遍性的问题，把批评与自我批评的锋芒引向这方面来，避免把批评与自我批评仅仅用去解决一些生活琐事问题。
    党组织掌握了党员中间存在的主要的带普遍性的问题以后，要对这些问题加以分析批判和提出改进意见，然后向党员进行传达并号召党员联系自己进行检查。一年来，我们体会到这是解决党员中间存在的问题的最有效的方法。省直属机关党委在一九五四年第一季度，就全面地研究了机关中党员干部存在的主要问题，然后召开了总支委员、支部委员、小组长会议和党员大会，由党委书记作报告。会后各总支、支部组织党员进行了讨论，多数党员都联系自己进行了检查。结果，对于解决当前省直属机关某些党员干部工作上、思想上以及执行政策等方面存在的问题有很大帮助。
    在开展批评与自我批评时，强调自下而上的批评尤为重要。松江省直属机关党组织初步地注意了开展自下而上的批评。在省直属机关两次党员代表大会上不但特别强调说明了开展自下而上的批评的重要意义，同时，也规定了一些必要的措施如严格行政负责干部的组织生活等，以便及时地开展批评与自我批评。去年，我们还组织党员学习了人民日报发表的黄逸峰压制批评的事件，并联系自己进行了检查和批判。在日常工作中也注意了检查开展自下而上批评的情形，并向个别领导干部压制批评压制民主的情形进行了斗争。因而自下而上的批评有了很大的开展。负行政责任的党员干部一般都能按时参加党的各种会议，听取党员的批评，在日常工作中也能听取群众的批评意见。例如松江日报发表了读者揭发汤原县煤建公司向省商业厅所报的成绩不准确，并批评了商业厅厅长关舟同志的消息后，关舟同志就严肃地在报纸上检讨了自己应负的领导责任。但是，在省直属机关内也还有个别负行政领导责任的党员干部很缺乏批评与自我批评的精神。虽然他们口头上也讲批评与自我批评的重要，但当下面党员对他们提出批评以后，他们就不满意了。省人民银行有位副行长就是这样。一九五三年第二季度百货批发站及部分企业单位给松江日报投稿，批评银行压缩现金指标，影响批发站进货及部分企业单位资金周转。报社督促银行进行检讨，支部将材料转给他时，他说：“你们（支部）告诉报社，就说我不愿意检讨。”支部对他这种抵抗批评的错误行为进行了严肃的斗争，在支委扩大会议上，连续进行了两次批判。又如省公路局一个干部给领导方面提过几次批评性的意见，而领导方面就借故把这个干部解职了。从这些情况看来，有些行政负责同志，对来自群众的批评不是持欢迎的态度，而是有抵制的情绪的。因而，当有人对他们提出批评时，他们就总想找出理由来掩饰自己的错误行为并反击别人。领导者这样惧怕批评不仅不能及时地改正工作中的缺点和错误，而且会压制党员积极性、主动性的发挥。马林科夫在联共（布）第十九次代表大会上指出：“目前特别重要的，是保证展开自我批评与自下而上的批评，把那些阻碍对我们的缺点开展批评、压制批评及对批评者实行迫害与报复的人，当作党的死敌，与之进行无情的斗争。”“不能展开批评和自我批评的工作人员是我们前进的障碍，他们还没有成熟得能做领导者，他们不能指望党的信任。”那些害怕批评和害怕暴露缺点或错误的领导者，应当更好的正视这一点，以端正对批评所采取的错误态度。同时，党组织必须对自下而上的批评给以支持、鼓励，使批评者感到他们所提出的意见会被认真处理，他们自己不会因为批评领导者而遭到打击或报复，即或遭到打击报复，也有党的支持。这样，他们才能无所顾虑地向任何人，特别是向领导者的缺点提出批评。
    为了更好地开展自下而上的批评，党的组织还必须教育党员克服各种错误观点。有些人认为对领导者提出批评，就会使领导者对自己有不好的看法，害怕受打击、报复以及影响提拔等。这些想法是不对的。因为他们不是把党和人民的利益放在个人利益之上，而是首先考虑个人得失。因此，党组织要教育每个党员，使他们能够做到个人利益坚决服从党的利益，不顾情面地对任何人的缺点或错误提出批评，对原则性的缺点或错误进行不调和的斗争。
    为了更好地开展批评和自我批评，党的组织还要及时地表扬那些敢于正视自己缺点和错误的党员，同时教育大家对有缺点或错误的党员不能持歧视的态度，而应积极地认真地帮助他们迅速改正缺点或错误。只有这样，才能运用批评与自我批评达到治病救人的目的。
