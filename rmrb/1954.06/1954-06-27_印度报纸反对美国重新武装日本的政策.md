    Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, June 24th (TASS): Indian public opinion opposes the US policy of rearming Japan, believing that this action is a direct threat to peace and security in Asia. An editorial in the "Hindustan Standard" pointed out that the Yoshida government, in violation of the constitution, is dragging Japan into a US military alliance in the Pacific. The newspaper wrote that the revival of the arms industry will prompt the resurgence of former militarist and financial groups.

    The "Hindustan Standard" emphasized: "Peaceful sentiments are growing in Japan. The people oppose rearming Japan and oppose Japan's participation in groups composed of certain countries. The Japanese people understand that rearming Japan can only make a new war increasingly imminent. Japan was the first country to be bombed by atomic bombs. The Japanese people have vivid memories of the experiences in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Furthermore, rearming Japan also means a decline in the people's living standards, which are already very low."

    印度报纸反对美国重新武装日本的政策
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社德里二十四日电：印度舆论反对美国重新武装日本的政策，认为这种行动是对亚洲和平和安全的直接威胁。“印度斯坦旗报”社论指出，吉田政府违反宪法，正在将日本拖入美国在太平洋的军事同盟。报纸写道，军火工业的复活将促使以前的军国主义和金融集团卷土重来。
    “印度斯坦旗报”强调指出：“在日本主张和平的情绪增长了。人民反对重新武装日本，反对日本参加某些国家组成的集团。日本人民懂得，重新武装日本只能使新战争日益迫近。日本是第一个遭到原子弹轰炸的国家。日本人民对广岛和长崎的体验记忆犹新。此外，重新武装日本还意味着人民生活水平的下降，而现在日本人民生活水平已经是很低的了。”
