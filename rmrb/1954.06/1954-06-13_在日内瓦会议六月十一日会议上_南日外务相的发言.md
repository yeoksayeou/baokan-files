    At the very beginning of this conference, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward a proposal for the peaceful settlement of the Korean question on a democratic basis. During the discussion on the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, representatives of certain other countries also put forward suggestions for the conference to consider.

    Although differences of opinion can be seen in the process of discussing our proposals, some participants in this conference have indicated that it is possible to find ways to reach agreement on certain fundamental principles of the peaceful settlement of Korea. We agree with this view and believe that passing preliminary resolutions on the general principles of peaceful settlement would greatly facilitate the completion of the current conference's tasks and enable the conference to find possibilities for reaching agreement on issues where participants have different opinions.

    We fully agree with the opinion of Mr. Molotov, the chief representative of the Soviet delegation, who believes that it is appropriate to pass preliminary resolutions on the general principles of the peaceful settlement of Korea.

    In order to peacefully unify Korea on democratic principles, our delegation, at the very beginning of this conference, proposed holding all-Korea elections for the National Assembly on the basis of the free expression of the will of all the Korean people, in order to form a unified Korean government. The majority of the participants in this conference agreed with our view.

    Regarding the issue of forming an all-Korea body to prepare and hold general elections, our delegation, in proposing the establishment of an all-Korea commission, proceeded from the view that unifying the divided Korea into one country through democratic elections is a matter for the Korean people themselves; the preparation work for general elections should be carried out throughout Korea. We believe that if a person has any desire to unify Korea peacefully according to democratic principles and recognizes that for the sake of unifying Korea, all-Korea elections must be conducted by the Koreans themselves, then he has no reason to oppose the establishment of an all-Korea body to prepare and hold such elections.

    The participants in this conference have recognized that the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea is one of the most important measures for the peaceful settlement of the Korean question. In order to eliminate foreign interference in the work of restoring peace in Korea and holding all-Korea elections to establish a unified all-Korea government, and in order to hold such elections in a truly free environment, all foreign troops must be withdrawn from the entire territory of Korea. To this end, we proposed the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea before the elections are held. Taking into account the statements of some representatives, we would like to clarify here that the time limit for the withdrawal of foreign troops can be stipulated, and in principle, we do not oppose the method of withdrawing foreign troops in stages, as long as the principle of proportionality is observed.

    We agree with Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal to form an international commission composed of neutral countries that have not participated in the Korean War to supervise the Korean elections. In doing so, we also took into account the opinions of some representatives who also acknowledged the need to establish an international body to supervise the all-Korea elections. Therefore, it can be affirmed that everyone agrees on this principle issue.

    So far, regarding the point that countries with the greatest concern for maintaining peace in the Far East should undertake corresponding obligations to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea, no participant in the conference has expressed disagreement, except for the South Korean representative, who fundamentally opposes any proposal for the peaceful settlement of Korea, and the American representative who supports him. The vast majority of the participants in this conference have recognized the need to create conditions sufficient to eliminate the possibility of the recurrence of war and to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea.

    We believe that the issue of maintaining peace in Korea is important for the Korean people, and this issue must be resolved by this conference in order to ensure that the Korean people have the opportunity to engage in the work of restoring their national economy, which has been destroyed by the war.

    This is necessary for Korea, and for maintaining peace in the Far East and the world.

    Therefore, the conference has a solid basis for passing preliminary resolutions on the general principles of the peaceful settlement of Korea. Therefore, our delegation supports the draft resolution proposed by the Soviet delegation on June 5, and we believe that the passage of this draft will facilitate the conference in completing its task of peacefully settling the Korean question.

    Finally, I must mention the speech of the American representative on June 5, in which he insisted that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea has not been able to carry out its tasks due to the attitude adopted by the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the commission.

    It can be said that if the American military authorities had not violated the armistice agreement and tried every possible means to obstruct the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its inspection teams, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea would certainly have been able to carry out its activities more effectively.

    The declarations made by the Polish and Czechoslovak members to the Korean Military Armistice Commission on April 15, April 30, and May 20 are well known, in which they pointed out that the American military authorities were trying their best to undermine the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea.

    I would like to provide the conference with some facts that are sufficient to confirm this situation. For example, according to the records of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's meetings on September 15 and October 9, 1953, for example, at the port of entry and exit in Busan, the American authorities refused the inspection team the power to inspect the goods on ships, open boxes, and inspect manifests. Everyone knows that the United Nations Command violated the armistice agreement and illegally transported strategic materials into South Korea. Such an example can be seen in the special report submitted by the Busan Inspection Team to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on September 11, 1953. This document pointed out that the American side did not notify the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission that 318 boxes were shipped into South Korea, containing 106 dismantled mortars. This fact was revealed by the inspection team of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. In contrast, we can use the records of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission inspection teams working in North Korea to prove that their activities have always received all possible support from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. From the first day of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission inspection teams' work (August 18, 1953) until May 1954, they carried out a total of 953 on-site inspections, which is sufficient to prove that normal conditions have always been created for their activities in North Korea. It must also be pointed out that General Reiner, the Swiss member of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and General Grafström, the Swedish member, acknowledged at the commission's meeting on September 23, 1953, that the North Korean authorities provided the necessary assistance for the activities of the inspection teams.

    From these facts, it is clear that the American representative's speech about the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is inconsistent with the facts.

    在日内瓦会议六月十一日会议上
    南日外务相的发言
    在这个会议刚一开始的时候，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团就提出了在民主基础上和平解决朝鲜问题的建议。在关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论过程中，某些其他国家的代表也提出了建议供大会考虑。
    尽管在讨论我们的建议的过程中可以看到看法有所不同，但是，这个会议的某些参加者已经表示，在关于朝鲜和平解决的某些原则问题上是能够找出办法来达成协议的。我们同意这个看法，并认为就和平解决的总的原则问题通过初步决议，能大大地使完成目前会议的任务更加容易，并使得会议能够找出在与会者有不同意见的问题上达成协议的可能性。
    我们完全同意苏联代表团首席代表莫洛托夫先生的意见，他认为就朝鲜和平解决的总的原则问题通过初步决议是适当的。
    为根据民主原则和平统一朝鲜，我们代表团在这个会议刚一开始的时候，就建议在全朝鲜人民自由表示意志的基础上，举行国民议会的全朝鲜选举，以组成朝鲜的统一政府。这个会议的大多数参加者同意我们的看法。
    至于组成全朝鲜机构来准备并举行普选问题，我们的代表团在提出组成全朝鲜委员会的建议时，是从这样的意见出发的，即：用民主选举的办法来把分裂的朝鲜统一成为一个国家，这是朝鲜人民自己的事情；普选的准备工作应该在朝鲜各地进行。我们认为假如一个人具有根据民主原则以和平办法来统一朝鲜的任何愿望，并认识到为了统一朝鲜，必须由朝鲜人自己来进行全朝鲜选举的话，他就没有理由反对组成全朝鲜机构以准备和举行这种选举。
    本会议的参加者已承认，自朝鲜撤退外国军队是为了和平解决朝鲜问题的最重要措施之一。为了要在恢复朝鲜和平以及举行全朝鲜选举以成立一个全朝鲜的统一政府的工作中排除外国干涉，为了在真正自由的情况下举行这种选举，一切外国军队必须从朝鲜的全部领土上撤退。为此目的，我们提议在举行选举之前，自朝鲜撤退一切外国军队。考虑到某些代表们的发言，我们在这里说明了撤退外国军队的时限可以加以规定的，并且在原则上我们并不反对分期撤退外国军队的办法，只要按比例的原则会得到遵守。
    我们同意周恩来外长所提关于由未曾参加朝鲜战争的一些中立国家组成国际委员会来监察朝鲜选举的建议。我们在这样做时，也考虑到某些代表们的意见，他们也承认有必要成立一个国际机构来监察全朝鲜选举。因此，可以肯定，在这个原则问题上，大家意见是一致的。
    到目前为止，关于由那些对维护远东和平具有最大关心的国家承担保证朝鲜和平发展的相应义务这一点，除了根本反对和平解决朝鲜问题的任何建议的南朝鲜代表和为他撑腰的美国代表之外，还没有一个会议的参加者表示不同意见。本会议的参加者绝大多数都已承认有必要创造足以消除战争再起的可能性以及保证朝鲜和平发展的条件。
    我们认为，维护朝鲜和平问题对于朝鲜人民说来是重要的，这个问题必须由本会议来解决，这样才能保障朝鲜人民有可能从事恢复他们的被战争破坏的国民经济的工作。
    对于朝鲜，对于维护远东与全世界和平，这都是必要的。
    因此，会议有充分的基础就朝鲜和平解决的总的原则问题通过初步决议。因此，我们的代表团支持苏联代表团在六月五日提出的决议草案，我们认为，通过这个草案会便于会议完成它所要完成的关于和平解决朝鲜问题的任务。
    最后，我不得不提一下美国代表在六月五日的发言，他在发言中硬说朝鲜中立国监察委员会由于该委员会的波兰与捷克斯洛伐克委员所采取的态度，没有能够执行它的任务。
    可以说，假如美国军事当局不破坏停战协定，并千方百计地阻挠中立国监察委员会及其视察小组的活动的话，朝鲜中立国监察委员会必然是能够更加有效地展开它的活动的。
    波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员在四月十五日、三十日和五月二十日几次致朝鲜军事停战委员会的声明，是大家都知道的，他们在声明中指出美国军事当局竭力想破坏朝鲜中立国监察委员会的工作。
    我愿意向会议提供一些足以证实这种情况的事实。譬如，根据中立国监察委员会一九五三年九月十五日和十月九日两次会议的记录，例如，在釜山这个出入口岸，美国当局拒绝视察小组执行检查船上的货物、打开箱子和检查货单的职权。大家都知道，联合国军总司令部方面违反停战协定，用非法的手段把战略物资运进南朝鲜。在釜山视察小组一九五三年九月十一日向中立国监察委员会所提供的特别报告中就可以看到一个这样的例子。这个文件指出，美国方面没有通知中立国监察委员会，运入南朝鲜三百十八个箱子，其中装着一百零六门拆散的迫击炮。这个事实是中立国监察委员会的视察小组透露的。与此相反，我们可以用在北朝鲜工作的中立国视察小组的记录，来证明他们的活动一直得到朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面一切可能的支持。自中立国视察小组进行工作的第一天（一九五三年八月十八日）起一直到一九五四年五月这一段期间中，他们总共执行了九百五十三次当场检查监督，这足以证明在北朝鲜一直为他们的活动创造正常的条件。还必须指出：中立国监察委员会里的瑞士委员莱纳将军和瑞典委员格拉夫斯特鲁将军在一九五三年九月二十三日的委员会的会议上承认，北朝鲜政权对视察小组的活动提供了必要的帮助。
    从这些事实中，显然可以看出，美国代表的关于中立国监察委员会的发言是和事实不符的。
