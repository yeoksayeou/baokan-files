    The German Democratic Republic Government's Concern for Workers' Welfare
    Kong Mo Le, Secretary of the Presidium of the Free German Trade Union Federation
    Because the power of the Konzern bosses and bankers, landlords and war criminals was overthrown within the territory of the German Democratic Republic, the working class laid the foundation for a new life of peace, freedom, and happiness on one-third of German land.
    In the German Democratic Republic, the working class occupies a leading position, and the trade unions—the mass organizations of the working class—enjoy broad co-determination rights guaranteed by the constitution. The policies of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the government of the German Democratic Republic are formulated based on the principle of constant concern for people. This policy is inextricably linked to the struggle to establish a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany and to safeguard peace in Europe, and thus is in line with the interests of the entire German working class and all working people. At the same time, the trade unions of the German Democratic Republic, in carrying out their tasks, also consider and represent the interests of the entire German working class.
    The German Democratic Republic and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany tirelessly care about the improvement of the welfare of the workers in democratic Germany. A significant manifestation of this is the "Decree on Further Improving the Living and Working Conditions of Workers and Expanding the Rights of Trade Unions" passed by the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic on December 10, 1953. This decree gives the workers and trade unions of democratic Germany extensive rights and possibilities to support the government's measures, thereby consolidating the worker-peasant power of the German Democratic Republic—the fortress in the struggle to establish a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany.
    This decree enhances the rights of trade unions, especially expanding the right to supervise the work of state organs and economic cadres, while also raising significant responsibilities and tasks. Currently, after the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, these tasks primarily involve publicizing the content and political significance of this decree to all workers in state-owned and private enterprises in the German Democratic Republic, as well as to workers in West German and West Berlin enterprises, and implementing it in our German Democratic Republic enterprises. The implementation of the decree will greatly improve workers' social welfare, cultural life, and working conditions, and will further convince the working people of West Germany that the path taken by the German Democratic Republic is correct.
    Herbert Warnke, Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation, wrote in the Free German Trade Union Federation's newspaper "Tribune" on January 28th of this year, when discussing the new decree: "For the central leading bodies of the trade unions, the main method for comprehensively realizing this decree lies in guiding the leading bodies at the district and local levels to regularly implement this decree, discussing this decree in various departments, and guiding the work of the enterprise trade union leading bodies...
    For the leading bodies of enterprise trade unions—whether state-owned or private enterprises, whether administrative organs or art and science institutions—the main method for realizing this decree throughout the enterprise and its various departments and aspects lies in guiding all trade union activists to regularly hold meetings for discussions, discussing the implementation of their special tasks with each committee, guiding the leading bodies of each department trade union, and helping them guide trade union groups to discuss and implement this decree."
    Due to the initiative of the trade unions in their work in implementing this decree, the trade unions have completed one of their most important tasks and ensured the raising of the working people's class consciousness and patriotism, while also ensuring the further development of the achievements of state-owned enterprises and the strengthening of the struggle against the people's enemy, the Adenauer regime.
    Especially now, the trade unions of the German Democratic Republic should further strengthen the publicity to the workers in West Berlin and West Germany about this decree aimed at improving workers' living conditions and working conditions, as well as the achievements gained in implementing this decree, especially inviting many worker delegations from West Berlin and West Germany to visit factories in the German Democratic Republic to understand the achievements of the working class in the German Democratic Republic. Delegations from our state-owned factories also go to West Germany to conduct good explanatory work, which is even more necessary than before because Adenauer is currently reducing the living standards of the working people in West Germany again. The manifestation of the decline in the living standards of the working people in West Germany is the rise in prices. For example, bread has increased by thirty-five percent, milk has increased by five pfennigs per liter, coffee has increased by five to ten percent, and household coal has also increased significantly. These are the measures of the government that is completely unconcerned about the welfare of workers and the working class, but only concerned about the interests of monopoly capitalists and war profiteers, this government imposes the costs and burdens of preparing for a new war on the working people.
    According to the decree of December 10, 1953, the wages of workers in the fifth to eighth grades in state-owned and private enterprises in the German Democratic Republic have increased. At the same time, the state has also allocated 100 million marks for workers and staff to build private houses, and 50 million marks for cooperatives to build workers' residential areas; the funds directly allocated by the state for building housing total 764 million marks.
    According to this decree, agricultural workers and tractor drivers also have the opportunity to quickly obtain beautiful housing. This decree gives workers and staff extensive supervisory rights. In the decree, the government requires trade unions to meticulously organize workers to supervise construction and housing. In addition, competitions should also be organized among construction workers to complete the construction of housing, new hospitals, kindergartens, nurseries, shops, bathhouses, laundries, and other social facilities ahead of schedule. At the same time, another important task in the competition is to improve the quality of work and systematically reduce costs. The working people are convinced that through their own creativity and initiative, their living conditions can be improved more quickly.
    The employees of many factories have passed specific resolutions at meetings to implement this decree. In this regard, the considerable achievements that have already been seen are reflected in this series of reforms. For example, at the Leipzig Power Distribution Station, after consultation with the factory leadership, it was decided to repair a club before January 30, 1954, for which the factory leadership has allocated 12,000 marks; in addition, four houses are to be built on a foundation that was destroyed by bombs; a day nursery is to be established and a sports field opened; a shower facility is to be built; a children's library is to be established; a sick meal system is to be established, and meals are to be provided in the dining hall. The carriage workers of Armen Village in the Halle district, due to their own enthusiasm and active participation in work, have completed two houses with twenty-four rooms three months ahead of schedule. In order to improve working conditions, the leadership of the Lonza factory in Spremberg decided to install fan ventilation equipment in Furnace No. 2 and No. 3 before the second quarter of this year. In order to improve sanitary conditions, women workers' rest rooms have been built in the Mansfeld United Factory and other factories. The eleven elderly workers and three newly married couples at the Dresden Optical Precision Instruments Factory felt great excitement and joy when they received bonuses from the factory trade union leadership. At the Dresden Precision Measuring Instruments Factory, five retired workers each received one hundred marks, three newly married couples each received one hundred marks, and three apprentices each received thirty marks, and everyone was very happy. In addition, seventy-six packages of gifts were sent to West Germany, some of whom have already written letters of thanks.
    These are just a few examples of the implementation of the December 10, 1953 decree and the measures that have been taken.
    The trade unions have set themselves the task of strengthening the struggle to realize the decree in various departments. So far, there are still shortcomings in the implementation of the decree, whether in state organs, factory leadership, or trade union leadership. It has not yet been possible to carry out a planned struggle for the realization of the decree every day and every moment. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to strengthen the trade unions' planned supervision work. These shortcomings have now been recognized, and measures have been taken to quickly overcome these shortcomings. One of the ways to do this is to conclude and implement enterprise collective contracts in state-owned enterprises, and the trade unions are responsible for supervising the implementation of this contract. In private capitalist enterprises, the trade unions supervise the factory to strictly abide by enterprise agreements and labor protection agreements.
    The measures stipulated in the decree are a great achievement of the peaceful construction work of the workers in democratic Germany, and at the same time, they reflect the constantly improving happy life of the workers.
    The working people of the German Democratic Republic realize the government's new decree aimed at improving life with a high sense of responsibility and joyful labor. The achievements we have already made in this regard demonstrate the superiority of our social system over the capitalist system, and are also proof of the goal-oriented peaceful construction work of the German Democratic Republic.

    德意志民主共和国政府对于工人福利的关怀
    自由德国工会联合会主席团  书记处书记  孔默勒
    由于在德意志民主共和国境内推翻了康采恩老板和银行家、大地主和战犯的政权，工人阶级在德国三分之一的土地上奠定了和平、自由与幸福的新生活的基础。
    在德意志民主共和国，工人阶级已居于领导的地位，工人阶级的群众组织——工会享有为宪法所保障的广泛的共同决定权。德国统一社会党和德意志民主共和国政府的政策，是根据经常对人的关怀的原则来制订的。这种政策和争取建立一个统一、爱好和平与民主的德国并维护欧洲和平的斗争不可分割地联系在一起，因而符合于全德国工人阶级和所有劳动人民的利益。同时，德意志民主共和国的工会在执行自己任务的时候，也考虑到和代表着全德国工人阶级的利益。
    德意志民主共和国和德国统一社会党不倦地关心着民主德国工人的福利的提高。这方面的一个显著表现就是德意志民主共和国部长会议在一九五三年十二月十日所通过的“关于进一步改善工人的生活及劳动条件并扩大工会权利”的法令。这个法令给予民主德国的工人和工会以广泛的权利与可能来支持政府的措施，并借此巩固在争取建立统一、爱好和平与民主的德国的斗争中的堡垒——德意志民主共和国的工农政权。
    这一法令提高了工会的权利，特别是扩大了对国家机关和经济干部的工作进行监督的权利，同时也提出了重大的责任和任务。目前，在柏林四国外长会议之后，这些任务首先在于向德意志民主共和国国营和私营企业的全体工人以及西德和西柏林企业的工人们宣传这一法令的内容和政治意义，并在我们德意志民主共和国的企业中贯彻执行。由于法令的执行，使得工人的社会福利、文化生活和劳动条件方面得到了很大的改善，并将更加使西德劳动人民相信德意志民主共和国所走的道路是正确的。
    自由德国工会联合会主席赫伯特·瓦恩克于今年一月二十八日在自由德国工会联合会机关报“论坛报”上谈到新法令时写道：“对于工会中央领导机构来说，全面实现这一法令的主要方法，在于引导各个区和地方的领导机构经常执行这一法令，在各个部门里讨论这一法令，并指导企业工会领导机构的工作……
    对于企业工会的领导机构来说——不论国营和私营企业，不论行政机关和艺术、科学机构——在整个企业和企业的各个部门、各个方面，实现这一法令的主要方法在于引导全体工会积极分子经常召开会议进行讨论，和每个委员会讨论关于执行它们的特殊任务的情况，指导每个部门工会的领导机构，帮助他们引导工会小组讨论并执行这一法令。”
    由于工会在执行这一法令时的工作上的主动性，工会完成了它最重要的任务之一，并保证提高劳动人民的阶级觉悟和爱国主义思想，同时保证国营企业的劳动成就得到进一步的发展，反对人民敌人阿登纳政权的斗争得到加强。
    特别是现在，德意志民主共和国的工会更应加强向西柏林和西德的工人宣传这一旨在改善工人生活状况及劳动条件的法令及在执行这一法令中所获得的成就，特别是请许多西柏林和西德的工人代表团到德意志民主共和国的工厂来参观，以便了解德意志民主共和国工人阶级的成就。我们国营工厂的代表团也到西德去进行很好的解释工作，这种解释工作由于阿登纳目前又在降低西德劳动人民的生活水平因而比以前更有必要。西德劳动人民生活水平降低的表现就是物价的上涨。例如，面包上涨了百分之三十五，牛奶每一公升上涨了五个芬尼，咖啡上涨了百分之五至十，家庭用煤同样也上涨了很多。这就是那个毫不关心工人和劳动阶层福利，而只关心垄断资本家和战争贩子利益的政府的措施，这个政府把准备新战争的费用和负担强加在劳动人民的身上。
    根据一九五三年十二月十日的法令，德意志民主共和国国营和私营企业的第五级到第八级工人的工资增加了。同时，国家还拨出了一亿马克供工人和职员建筑私人住宅之用，五千万马克供建筑工人住宅区的合作社之用；直接由国家拨付来建筑住宅的经费共为七亿六千四百万马克。
    根据这一法令，农业工人和拖拉机手们也有可能很快地得到漂亮的住房。这一法令给予工人和职工广泛的监督权利。在法令里，政府要求工会周密地组织工人对建设和住宅方面的监督。此外，还应该在建筑工人中组织提早完成修建住房、新医院、幼儿园、托儿所、商店、澡堂、洗衣房和其它社会设施的竞赛。同时在竞赛中的另一个重要任务是改善工作的质量并有系统地降低成本。劳动人民确信，通过他们自己的创造性和主动性，他们的生活状况就能得到更快的改善。
    许多工厂的职工们在集会上通过了实现这一法令的具体决议。在这方面，已经看得到的可观的成就表现在这一系列的改革中。例如，在莱比锡配电所，经过与工厂领导方面的洽商，决定在一九五四年一月三十日以前修好一所俱乐部，工厂领导方面已为此拨款一万二千马克；此外，在一处被炸弹毁坏了的地基上建筑四所住宅；设立一个日间托儿所并开辟一个运动场；修建一个淋浴设备；建立一个儿童图书馆；建立病号进餐制，并在饭厅供应膳食。哈莱区阿门村的车厢工人由于自己的积极性和主动地参加工作，已提前三个月完成了两幢有二十四间房的住宅。为了改善劳动条件，斯普勒贝尔格的隆查工厂的领导方面决定在今年第二季度前在二号和三号炉安装风扇通风设备。为了改善卫生条件，在曼斯菲尔联合工厂和其他工厂里兴建了女工休息室。德累斯顿光学精密仪器工厂的十一位老年工人和三对新婚夫妇在接受工厂工会领导方面颁发的奖金时，感到极大的兴奋和喜悦。在德累斯顿精密测量仪器工厂，五个退休工人每人得到一百马克，三对新婚夫妇每对得到一百马克，三个学徒每人得到三十马克，大家都很高兴。此外，还寄了七十六包礼物到西德去，其中有的收件人已经来信表示感谢。
    这些仅仅是实行一九五三年十二月十日法令若干例子和已经采取的措施。
    工会给自己提出了在各个部门中为加强实现法令斗争的任务。至今不论在国家机关、工厂领导，或者工会领导方面，在贯彻法令中都还有着缺点。目前还没有做到每日每刻为法令的实现进行有计划的斗争。为了达到这一目的，必须加强工会有计划的监督工作。这些缺点现在已经认识到了，并已采取了迅速克服这些缺点的措施。其中的一个办法就是在国营企业中缔结和实行企业集体合同，工会负责监督这个合同的执行，在私营资本主义企业中，工会监督厂方严格地遵守企业协议和劳动保护协议。
    在法令中规定的措施是民主德国工人和平建设工作的一大成就，同时反映出工人们的不断改善的幸福生活。
    德意志民主共和国劳动人民以高度的责任感和愉快的劳动来实现政府这个旨在改善生活的新法令。我们在这方面已经获得的成就表明了我们的社会制度对资本主义制度的优越性，同时也是德意志民主共和国进行目标明确的和平建设工作的证明。
