Polish News Agency Authorized to Issue Statement
Denouncing US Slander Against Polish and Czech Members of Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission

[Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 10th] The Polish News Agency reported from Warsaw on the 9th: Recently, a special document issued by the United States Department of Defense and statements in certain American newspapers have contained slanderous accusations against the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea.

The Polish News Agency is hereby authorized to issue the following statement:

The claim that the Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission are obstructing the activities of the commission is unfounded and false. Since the establishment of the commission, the Polish members of the commission have consistently and strictly carried out the tasks entrusted to them by the Armistice Agreement, in accordance with the spirit and provisions of the Armistice Agreement and with the sole desire to safeguard peace in Korea.

The minutes of the commission's meetings, the commission's reports to the Military Armistice Commission, and the working records of the inspection teams all prove this point. These documents all demonstrate that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been acting with goodwill and effectively complying with the Armistice Agreement, and also demonstrate that the so-called United Nations Command has consistently violated the Armistice Agreement.

A few examples are enough: The US side refused to accept inspections in Incheon; and more recently, it unilaterally implemented so-called new inspection procedures in South Korea, which are contrary to the provisions of the Armistice Agreement. Unfortunately, these acts of sabotage have been shielded by the Swedish and Swiss members of the commission more than once.

According to Polish officials, the deliberate and fabricated false accusations against the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the commission are being made precisely at a time when the aim is to obstruct or even interrupt the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. At the same time, it is clear that the purpose of these accusations is also to hinder efforts to find a similar solution to the conflict in Indochina.

It is no coincidence that this move is taking place at a time when the Geneva Conference is considering proposals for the establishment of a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Indochina.

The document published by the United States Department of Defense and the statements in the American press are part of the activities of those who deliberately undermine the Geneva Conference, with the aim of obstructing the Indochina armistice and preventing further easing of international tensions.

The Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission will continue to work tirelessly, regardless of these activities, to ensure that the commission continues its work.

Despite the many difficulties encountered so far, the Polish members will continue to work to promote cooperation among all members of the commission, so that the commission can supervise the implementation of the Armistice Agreement in order to maintain peace in Korea and the world.

### 波兰通讯社受权发表声明  斥美国对中立国监察委员会波捷委员的诽谤

    波兰通讯社受权发表声明
    斥美国对中立国监察委员会波捷委员的诽谤
    【新华社十日讯】波兰通讯社华沙九日讯：最近，美国国防部发表的一份特别文件以及美国某些报纸的言论都包含了对朝鲜中立国监察委员会的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员的诽谤性的指责。
    波兰通讯社为此受权发表下述声明：
    有人说中立国监察委员会中的波兰委员阻挠该委员会的活动，这种说法是没有根据的，是虚伪的。从该委员会成立之时起，委员会中的波兰委员根据停战协定的精神与条文并本着维护朝鲜和平的唯一愿望，过去以至现在一向严格地执行停战协定所赋予的任务。
    委员会各次会议的记录、委员会致军事停战委员会的报告以及各视察小组的工作记录都证明了这一点。这些文件都说明了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国怀着善良愿望并切实遵守停战协定，同时也说明了所谓联合国军司令部一贯破坏停战协定。
    只要举几个例子就够了：美方在仁川拒绝接受视察；不久以前又在南朝鲜片面地实行所谓新的监察程序，这种程序是和停战协定条款相抵触的。不幸的是，这种破坏行为却不止一次地受到了委员会中的瑞典和瑞士委员的包庇。
    根据波兰负责人士的意见，对委员会中的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员的蓄意捏造的虚假指责恰恰在目前这样一个时候提出来，目的在于阻挠或甚至中断中立国监察委员会的工作。同时很明显，这种指责的目的也在于阻挠人们为印度支那的冲突寻求类似的解决办法。
    这种举动发生在日内瓦会议正在考虑成立印度支那中立国监察委员会的建议的时候并不是一件偶然的事情。
    美国国防部所发表的文件以及美国报界的言论，是有意破坏日内瓦会议的人士所进行的活动的组成部分，其目的在于阻挠印度支那停战并阻止国际紧张局势进一步缓和。
    中立国监察委员会的波兰委员将不顾这些活动而继续不懈地努力，以便保证委员会继续它的工作。
    尽管到目前为止发生过许多困难，波兰委员将继续努力，促进委员会中的所有委员的合作，以便委员会为了维持朝鲜与全世界的和平而监督停战协定的实施。
