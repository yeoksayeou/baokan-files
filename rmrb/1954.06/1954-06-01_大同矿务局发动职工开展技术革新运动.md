Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, May 31st: The Datong Mining Bureau is currently carrying out a technical innovation movement in a guided and organized manner. Earlier this year, when the Datong Mining Bureau mobilized workers to launch a labor competition focusing on technical innovation, it first rectified the rationalization proposal committees of the mining bureau and its subordinate mines. Branch organizations were also newly established at all mine entrances. Based on last year's production situation, the mining bureau also proposed five major tasks to all employees, focusing on weak links and key issues in production: mechanization of tunneling roadways, stopes, and above-ground loading, as well as improving pit timber recovery and saving explosives. From January to mid-May, the mine's employees have put forward more than 300 rationalization proposals around these five major tasks. More than 30 of these suggestions have been implemented, and preliminary calculations show that they can increase production and save more than 300 million yuan for the country annually. Some others are being trial-manufactured or experimentally produced, and some are being drafted. Tunneling workers Zhang Wanfu and Bai Qixi successfully created the "relay slotting blasting method" and the "two-hole blasting method," which increased the tunneling distance by about one meter each time and saved a lot of explosives and detonators. According to the suggestion of technician Ren Ziqing, the No. 2 mine began trial production of an electric shovel loader, which can replace the heavy physical labor of about 60 loading workers.

When launching the technical innovation movement, the Datong Mining Bureau and its subordinate mines also paid special attention to implementing the spirit of combining labor and technology. Xi Changfu, a worker at the No. 3 mine, failed to independently research and create a roadway coal cutting machine last year. This year, when Xi Changfu put forward this suggestion, the trade union organization educated him to learn from last year's lessons and led the formation of a special research group of nine people, including technicians Rui Hongqin, Gu Liancheng, and veteran technical workers of various types of work. Now the first roadway coal cutting machine has been preliminarily trial-produced and is undergoing experimental production and further improvement. Once this machine is put into production, it will further improve tunneling efficiency and save at least one-third of explosives.

    大同矿务局发动职工开展技术革新运动
    【新华社太原三十一日电】大同矿务局正有领导有组织地逐步开展技术革新运动。今年初，大同矿务局在发动职工开展以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛时，就首先整顿了矿务局和所属各矿的合理化建议委员会，所有井口也新建了分会的组织。矿务局还根据去年生产情况，从生产薄弱环节和关键问题，向全体职工提出掘进巷道、回采工作面和井上装车的机械化以及提高坑木回收和节省炮药等五大课题。从一月到五月中旬，全矿职工已围绕着这五大课题，提出了三百多条合理化建议。这些建议有三十多件已经实现，初步计算全年可给国家增产节约三亿多元。其他的有的正在试制或试验生产，有的正在绘制蓝图。掘进工人张万福和白启锡创造“接力掏槽爆破法”和“两孔爆破法”成功，每遍就多掘进一公尺左右，并节省不少炮药和雷管。二矿根据技术员任子卿的建议开始试制的电扒装车机，可代替六十个左右装车工人的笨重体力劳动。
    大同矿务局和所属各矿在发动职工开展技术革新运动时，还特别注意贯彻劳动和技术相结合的精神。三矿工人席长富去年一年单独研究创造巷道割煤机没有成功，今年席长富提出这一建议时，工会组织就教育他接受去年的教训，并领导组成包括技术员芮鸿琴、顾连城和各工种老技术工人等九人参加的专门研究小组。现在第一部巷道割煤机已初步试制成功，正在试验生产和进一步改进。这部机器投入生产后，就能进一步提高掘进效率，并最少能节省三分之一以上的炮药。
