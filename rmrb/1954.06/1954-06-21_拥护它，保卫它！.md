    Uphold It, Defend It!
    Wu Zhenguo, Special Class Meritorious Hero of a Unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    The draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has been published, and I feel an indescribable joy in my heart. It is truly no easy feat for the Chinese people to have their own constitution!
    The reactionary rulers of China throughout history have all had their own forms of law, and some rulers have even established "constitutions"; but regardless of the law, they were all tools for deceiving and oppressing the common people. Take myself, for example. I started herding sheep for a landlord at the age of twelve, never having enough to eat or wear, and sleeping with the sheep in the sheepfold at night. In winter, when there was little grass on the mountains and the sheep couldn't get enough to eat, the landlord would beat and scold me for it. Once, a sheep fell off a mountain and died, and the landlord hung me up and beat me severely, and even now the marks from the rope remain on my wrist. After working like a cow and a horse for so many years, my parents still starved to death outside, and even then, the landlord would not allow me to go back and take care of their remains. And the laws of the Kuomintang reactionary rulers allowed landlords to act so lawlessly.
    After joining the revolution, under the Party's nurturing and education, I found the root of my suffering, saw a bright future, and developed a preliminary communist ideal, which also brought me unparalleled courage in battle. In 1949, during a battle to liberate the Southwest, I led a three-man vanguard squad to the enemy's heart. We were discovered by the enemy as soon as we entered their defense line, and they surrounded us. After holding out for an hour, we ran out of bullets, and I was slightly wounded. The enemy's shells and bullets continued to rain down on us indiscriminately, and the situation was extremely critical. At that time, I looked at the scars on my wrist left by the landlord and thought of the bright future of the revolution, and I said to the three comrades, "As long as we have a breath left, we must eliminate the enemy and not let the people suffer anymore!" So we fixed our bayonets and charged at the enemy. Later, we joined another squad, killed the enemy commander, and cooperated with the main force to wipe out this entire enemy force.
    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the efforts of the people of the whole country, the motherland has achieved brilliant achievements in all aspects. The draft Constitution consolidates these achievements, which the Chinese people have exchanged for blood and sweat over the years, in a legislative form, and also affirms the future of our country's socialist construction. This is the wish of so many people, how can it not make me happy! However, while rejoicing with the people of the whole country, we have not forgotten that there is still imperialism in the world, and we have not forgotten their wild plans to seize our fruits of victory and undermine our socialist construction by all means, which we absolutely cannot allow. And the draft Constitution also stipulates this sacred right for us:
  "The armed forces of the People's Republic of China belong to the people. Their task is to safeguard the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and to defend the security of the country and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty." (Article 20 of the draft Constitution) This is our glorious task and our sacred duty, and we must resolutely uphold it and defend it!

### 拥护它，保卫它！

    拥护它，保卫它！
    中国人民解放军某部特等功臣  吴振国
    中华人民共和国宪法草案公布了，我心里有说不出来的高兴。中国人民有了自己的宪法，真是一件不容易的事情啊！
    中国的历代反动统治者，都有过自己不同形式的法律，有些统治者也立过“宪法”；但不管这个法，那个法，都是欺骗老百姓、压迫老百姓的工具。比方我吧，十二岁就给地主放羊，整天吃不饱，穿不暖，夜里还和羊一起睡在羊圈里。冬天山上草少，羊吃不饱，地主就因此来打骂我。有一次，一只羊从山顶上掉下来摔死了，地主就把我吊起来狠狠地打了一顿，直到现在我的手腕上还残留着被绳子勒的痕迹。当牛，当马，干了那么多年，爹娘还是饿死在外边，就这样，地主也不准我回去收拾老人家的尸首。而国民党反动统治者的法律就允许地主这样无法无天。
    参加革命后，在党的培养教育下，我找到了苦根子，看到了幸福的前途，初步有了共产主义的理想，也给我带来了无比的斗争勇气。一九四九年，在解放西南的一次战斗中，我带领三个人组成的尖刀小组，插到敌人的心脏。我们刚进入敌人的防线，就叫敌人发现，并把我们包围住了。坚持一个钟头后，子弹打光了，我也负了轻伤，敌人的炮弹、子弹仍盲目地向我们打来，情况非常危急。当时，我看看手腕上叫地主勒的伤痕，又想起革命的美好前途，就向那三个同志说：“有一口气，也要消灭敌人，不能叫老百姓再受罪！”于是，我们上好了刺刀，就向敌人冲去。后来，我们和另一个小组会合一起，打死了敌人的指挥官，又配合主力全部歼灭了这一股敌人。
    中华人民共和国成立后，在党和毛主席领导下，在全国人民努力下，祖国各方面都获得了辉煌成就。宪法草案用立法形式巩固了中国人民多少年来用血汗换来的这些成果，还肯定了我国社会主义建设的前途，这是多少人的愿望啊，怎么能不使我高兴！但是，在和全国人民一道欢欣鼓舞的同时，我们并没有忘记世界上还有帝国主义，并没有忘记他们千方百计打算侵夺我们的胜利果实、破坏我们社会主义建设的狂妄计划，这是我们绝对不能答应的。而宪法草案上也给我们规定了这种神圣的权利：
  “中华人民共和国的武装力量属于人民，它的任务是保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的安全和领土主权的完整。”（宪法草案第二十条）这是我们的光荣任务，也是我们的神圣职责，我们要坚决地拥护它，保卫它！
