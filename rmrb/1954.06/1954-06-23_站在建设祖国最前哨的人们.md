    The People Standing at the Forefront of National Construction
    Yao Shantang
    In the northeastern border of our motherland, there is a geological prospecting team fighting in the high mountains and dense forests. Braving wind, rain, ice, and snow, they diligently search for underground coal deposits for the motherland.
    The winter here is the longest, with continuous snowfall and relentless winds from late October to April of the following year. Geologists are searching for the "doorways" to coal. Last December, trainee technician Huang Bin, alone in the remote mountains, drilled through the heavy snow and finally discovered the "route" of the coal in half a day. Technicians Zhang Han and two others, facing manpower shortages and the need to improve core sampling rates this February, persevered beside the drilling rig on the high mountains for three consecutive days and nights, identifying the thickness of the coal seams. After confirming the location of the coal, they were so excited that they forgot their fatigue and continued working indoors.
    The vanguards of exploration—the surveying and mapping personnel—reconnoiter "positions" for their brother units, traversing one or two *li* every day, summer and winter, climbing mountains eight or nine hundred meters above sea level to measure terrain and draw maps. In days of wind and snow, they survey on the mountain peaks, their hands and feet freezing, their eyes watering from the wind. But they stamp their feet, breathe warm air on their hands, wipe their eyes, and continue working. In January of this year, surveying worker Hu Shutian and three others went to a mountain to survey. The snow on the road was knee-deep, making it difficult to walk. They held onto tree roots, knelt in the snow, then stood up, moving their feet into the snow pits they had made, kneeling again, and advancing bit by bit. That's how they climbed the 930-plus-meter high mountain.
    Whenever the surveying and mapping personnel finish their work, the drilling workers follow with an intense battle.
    Drilling workers, in the severe cold of minus forty degrees Celsius, on mountains nearly a thousand meters high, set up towering drilling derricks. Their hands, feet, and ears ached as if bitten by cats; some were so frozen they couldn't even speak. When the drilling rig was running, mud splashed continuously from the drill pipe onto the workers' faces and bodies, freezing them like ice men. When the workers twisted the drill pipe's "lifting joint," their gloves were frozen stiff. They took off their gloves and worked with bare hands. When their hands touched the steel "lifting joint," the skin on their palms would stick to it, but they endured the pain to continue twisting it, not wanting to waste a single second. Transportation here is inconvenient. In the initial stages of work, they couldn't get refined grains, meat, or vegetables. Drilling workers only brought sorghum rice and pickles when they went up the mountain. When they were hungry, they ate a mouthful of cold sorghum rice and a bite of pickles. When they were thirsty, they grabbed a handful of snow to eat. Because the prospecting work is highly mobile, temporary housing could not be built in the mountains. After a day of intense work, the workers lived in temporary dormitories made of wooden planks, often waking up from the cold wind of the winter night. Even so, Wang Fuxing, a 51-year-old drilling worker who had lost one eye, would leave the plank house almost every night in the wee hours, braving the biting cold wind to climb the snow-covered mountains, personally operating the drill's "feed handle," listening intently to the sound of the drill bit biting into the rock to detect potential accidents. Old worker Zhang Yunsheng was worried about finding a partner after his wife died. However, his elder brother introduced him to an old companion this March and wrote twice urging him to return home to get married. In his reply, he said, "Brother! Prospecting for coalfields is a political task. I won't go home until I complete the task."
    The drilling team's brother unit—the pit exploration and well exploration fighters—wore shirts to dig pits and sink wells in temperatures of minus forty degrees Celsius, sweating profusely. A blast of cold wind would cover them with a layer of ice. The ground was frozen like stone, and a pickaxe would only leave a white mark. The palms and nail crevices of worker Liu Encheng's hands were cracked and bleeding. He scraped some pine resin from the pine trees nearby, applied it to his hands, and continued working. Workers digging coal underground were so cold that their upper and lower teeth chattered, but when they saw the shiny black coal, they excitedly said, "No matter how hard the ground is, it's not harder than our hearts."
    Although the work of the geological prospecting team is hard, they live very happily. In their spare time, in addition to studying, they also play ball on the courts they have created, and play chess and cards in the club. Every Saturday evening, they dance and sing. Listen to the songs they write and sing themselves:
    We sing joyfully  In the remote frontier
    We labor selflessly  In the beautiful mines
    We penetrate the rock layers with our steel will
    Knocking on the door of coal, iron, and oil

    站在建设祖国最前哨的人们
    姚善堂
    在祖国东北边疆，有一支地质勘探队战斗在高山峻岭和茂密的森林中。他们冒着风雨冰雪，辛勤地为祖国找寻地下的煤藏。
    这里冬季的时间最长，从十月末到次年四月不断地下雪，大风刮个不停。地质人员们在寻找着煤的“家门”。去年十二月间，见习技术员黄斌一个人在荒无人迹的深山里，在大雪里钻来钻去，终于用半天的时间发现了煤的“线路”。张汉等三个技术员，在今年二月间人力不足和煤芯采取率提高的情况下，曾连续三昼夜不眠不休地坚守在高山上的钻机旁边，鉴别着煤层的厚度；当他们确定了煤的位置以后，兴奋得忘记了疲倦，仍继续在室内工作。
    勘探的尖兵——测绘人员，为了给兄弟部队侦察“阵地”，不分冬天夏天，每天行走一、二十里路，踏上拔海八、九百公尺高的大山，去测量地形和绘图。在风雪交加的日子里，他们在山峰上测绘，手脚冻僵了，眼睛被风吹得流泪，但他们跺跺脚，用嘴呼出热气暖暖手，擦擦眼睛，继续工作下去。测绘工人胡书田等四人，在今年一月里到一个山上去测绘，路上积雪齐膝，迈不开步，他们就手扶树根，双膝跪在雪里，然后站起来，把脚向跪出的雪窝迈进一点，接着又跪雪窝，再迈进一点，他们就这样爬行，登上了九百三十多公尺的高山。
    每当测绘人员工作完了以后，跟着而来的就是钻探职工们紧张的战斗。
    钻探工人在零下四十多度的严寒里，在近千公尺的高山上，架设高大的钻塔时，手、脚和耳朵冻得像猫咬一般的疼，有的人冻得连话都说不出来；在开动钻机时，泥水不断从钻杆喷到工人的脸上和身上，工人们被冻得像冰人似的；工人扭钻杆的“提引接头”时，手套冻硬了，就脱下手套光着手干，当手接触钢质的“提引接头”时，手掌的皮就被黏下一块，但他们为了不耽误一秒钟的时间，忍疼继续扭下去。这里交通不便，在开始工作时期吃不到细粮、肉和蔬菜，钻探工人上山时只带些高粱米饭和咸菜。他们饿了，吃一口凉高粱米饭，咬一口咸菜，渴了就抓一把雪吃。由于勘探工作流动性很大，暂时还不能在山野修建住室；工人们紧张地工作了一天，下班后就住在用木板搭成的临时宿舍里，他们常常被冬夜的寒风吹醒。就是这样，坏了一只眼睛的五十一岁的老钻探工人王福兴，差不多每天半夜三更就离开板房，冒着刺骨的寒风，爬上积雪的高山，手把钻机“给进把”的手闸，倾耳静听钻头啃咬岩石的声音，探知是否会发生事故。老工人张运胜在老婆死后曾愁着找不到对象；可是，他哥哥在今年三月给他介绍了个老伴，两次来信催他回家结婚，他在回信里却说：“哥哥！勘探煤田是个政治任务，我不完成任务不回家。”
    钻探队的兄弟部队——坑探和井探的战士们，在零下四十多度的天气穿着衬衣挖坑打井，汗水直淌；寒风一吹，他们身上都结了一层冰。地冻得像石头一样，一镐刨个白点。工人刘恩成的手掌、指甲缝被震裂口，流出鲜血，他就从身边的松树上刮点松油抹抹手，继续干下去。工人们在井下挖煤，冻得上牙打下牙，咯咯作响，但当他们见到了乌亮的煤炭时，兴奋地说：“地再硬，也硬不过我们的心。”
    地质勘探队的职工们工作虽苦，可是生活得非常快乐。在业余时间里，他们除了学习，还在自己开辟的球场上打球，在俱乐部里下棋、打扑克，每到星期六的晚会上，他们就跳舞、唱歌。请听他们自编自唱的歌声：
    我们愉快地歌唱  在遥远的边疆
    我们忘我地劳动  在美丽的矿山
    用我们钢铁的意志穿透岩层
    敲开煤铁石油的家门
