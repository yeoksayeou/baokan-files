    Handicraft Production Developing in Yantai City, Shandong Province, and Nearby Counties
    The production of handicrafts such as embroidery, lace, and netting in Yantai City, Shandong Province, and nearby counties and cities has developed in recent years.
    Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, embroidery, lace, netting, and other handicrafts were the main export commodities from Yantai port. These products sold well in the South Seas and Europe and the United States, enjoying a high reputation in the international market for their exquisite workmanship and beautiful designs. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the production of these handicrafts has been damaged, and many skilled embroidery and lace/netting workers have turned to field labor and weaving production. After the liberation of Yantai and other places, with the recovery and development of the national economy and the increase in foreign orders, this production gradually recovered and developed with the active support of the People's Government. In February 1953, the Yantai Municipal People's Government issued instructions calling for the appropriate restoration and development of the production of handicrafts such as embroidery, netting, lace, and piece goods, in order to expand exports and meet the needs of the people at home. Now, the production of embroidery, netting, lace, etc. in Yantai, Laiyang, Wendeng, Muping, Fushan, Haiyang, Changyi, Penglai, Kunyu, Qixia, Zhaoyuan, Rushan, Rongcheng, Huangxian, Yexian, Weihai and other places is flourishing. This year, the Yantai Municipal Company of the China Native Produce Company has organized the processing of a large number of embroidered handicrafts. It is estimated that the output value of embroidery, lace and other handicrafts in this area will increase by 166% this year compared with last year.

    山东省烟台市和附近各县
    手工艺品的生产有发展
    山东省烟台市及附近县、市的绣花、花边、网扣等手工艺品的生产，几年来有了发展。
    抗日战争以前，绣花、花边、网扣等手工艺品是烟台口岸的主要出口物资，这些产品畅销南洋群岛及欧美各地，以工精、样美在国际市场上享有很高的信誉。抗日战争以来，此项手工艺品的生产受到破坏，许多熟练的绣花和织花边、网扣的工人转入了田间劳动和织布生产。烟台等地解放以后，随着国民经济的恢复和发展以及国外订货的增加，在人民政府的积极扶植下，此项生产逐渐恢复和发展起来。一九五三年二月，烟台市人民政府曾发出指示，号召适当恢复和发展绣花、网扣、花边、件货等手工艺品的生产，以扩大出口和满足国内人民的需要。现在，烟台、莱阳、文登、牟平、福山、海阳、昌邑、蓬莱、昆嵛、栖霞、招远、乳山、荣成、黄县、掖县、威海等地的绣花、网扣、花边等生产，正蓬勃开展起来。今年中国土产公司烟台市公司组织加工了大批刺绣等手工艺品。预计这一带地区今年绣花、花边等手工艺品的产值，将比去年增加百分之一百六十六。
