The People's Liberation Army Southwest, Northwest, and Central South Military Regions' Units are promoting the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

	The Southwest Military Region leadership held a report meeting on the Draft Constitution on the 18th. Li Da, Deputy Commander of the Southwest Military Region, gave a report on the content of the Draft Constitution and the methods of propaganda and discussion. He said that for the army, the Draft Constitution makes us feel more cordial and excited, and also makes us feel that the people's army has great and glorious responsibilities. He called on the entire military region to vigorously publicize and discuss the Draft Constitution, and to strengthen the cadres' and soldiers' love for the motherland, defending the motherland, and the idea that the People's Liberation Army is forever a fighting team. After the meeting, personnel from various agencies of the Southwest Military Region began to read the Draft Constitution and related documents in groups and discussed them. In the companies, cadres at all levels also conducted classes and discussions based on the teaching materials compiled and printed by the Political Department of the Southwest Military Region. Huang Shizhong, a hero of a certain artillery unit, said: "The Draft Constitution is closely related to the interests of the broad masses of the people throughout the country. The Draft Constitution stipulates the glorious tasks of our troops. We must constantly improve our ideological level and military technology, and use practical actions to express our love and support for the Draft Constitution."
	The units of the Southwest Military Region also began to publicize the Draft Constitution. The Sichuan Military Region leadership held a cadre report meeting on the 19th. After the meeting, the cadres of each unit went back to their units to convey the information and organize discussions. In addition to actively participating in discussions, the cadres and soldiers of the Xikang Military Region also publicized and explained the Draft Constitution to the Tibetan people near their station. The units of the Tibet Military Region and the Yunnan Military Region are also actively organizing the publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution, and the leadership organs have also issued materials related to the Draft Constitution.
	Since the 15th, all units of the Northwest Military Region have been organized to listen to news broadcasts about the Draft Constitution, and have used the wired broadcasting stations, quick reports, and blackboards in the units to publicize the Draft Constitution. After reading the Draft Constitution, soldier Kang Jialin thought of his past experience. He said that in the old society, he herded sheep for the landlord, was beaten and scolded, and could not even get enough to eat. Who protected the working people at that time? After liberation, my family was allocated land and houses, and our lives have been continuously improved. I have also had the opportunity to study culture in the army. All of this was given to me by the Communist Party and the people's democratic regime. The Draft Constitution not only guarantees the vital interests of the people, but also guides us to a happier socialist society. I firmly support the Draft Constitution.
	After the promulgation of the Draft Constitution, all agencies and units under the Northwest Military Region held report meetings and discussion meetings. The units directly under the Northwest Military Region and the units stationed in Lanzhou also held symposiums for representatives of meritorious persons and models.
	In order to enable the broad masses of commanders and fighters to deeply understand the content and spirit of the Draft Constitution, the units of the Central South Military Region used pictures, wall newspapers, slides, wired broadcasting, etc. to explain and publicize the Draft Constitution.

    解放军西南、西北、中南军区各部队
    开始宣传和讨论宪法草案
    中国人民解放军西南、西北、中南军区各部队宣传中华人民共和国宪法草案。
    西南军区领导机关在十八日举行了宪法草案报告大会。西南军区副司令员李达在会上作了关于宪法草案内容和宣传、讨论方法的报告。他说，对于军队来说，宪法草案更加使我们感到亲切和兴奋，也使我们感到人民军队的责任重大和光荣。他号召全军区部队大张旗鼓地宣传和讨论宪法草案，加强干部、战士热爱祖国、保卫祖国和人民解放军永远是一个战斗队的思想。会后，西南军区各机关人员开始按小组阅读宪法草案和有关文件，并进行讨论。在连队中，也由各级干部根据西南军区政治部编印的教材进行上课和讨论。某部炮兵英雄黄世忠说：“宪法草案和全国广大人民的利益是息息相关的。宪法草案规定了我们部队的光荣任务，我们必须不断地提高思想水平和军事技术，用实际行动来表示我们对宪法草案的热爱和拥护。”
    西南军区所属各军区部队也开始进行宪法草案的宣传。四川军区领导机关在十九日召开了干部报告大会，会后，各部队的干部分头回部队进行传达和组织讨论。西康军区干部、战士除积极进行讨论以外，并向驻地附近藏民进行宪法草案的宣传和解释。西藏军区和云南军区的部队，也正积极组织宪法草案的宣传和讨论，各领导机关并印发了有关宪法草案的材料。
    西北军区各部队从十五日起都有组织地收听有关宪法草案的新闻广播，并利用部队中的有线广播台、快报、黑板报来宣传宪法草案。战士康家林读了宪法草案后，想到个人过去的经历。他说，在旧社会中我给地主放羊，挨打受骂，还吃不饱。那时有谁保护劳动人民呢？解放后，我家里分到土地、房屋，生活也不断得到改善，我在部队中也得到学习文化的机会，这都是共产党和人民民主政权给我的。宪法草案不但保障了人民的切身利益，并且指引我们向更幸福的社会主义社会前进。我坚决拥护宪法草案。
    西北军区所属各机关、各部队在宪法草案公布后，都举行了报告会、座谈会。西北军区直属部队和驻兰州市的部队，并举行了功臣、模范代表座谈会。
