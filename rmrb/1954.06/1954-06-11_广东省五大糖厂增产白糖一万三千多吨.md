Guangdong's five state-owned sugar factories produced more than 13,570 tons more white sugar in the 1953-1954 sugarcane crushing season than in the previous season. At the same time, the quality of the sugar also improved. In addition to the original Shunde, Shitou, Dongguan, and Jieyang sugar factories, the newly built Zini Sugar Factory also participated in this sugarcane crushing season. This season has now ended. Due to the increased output of the sugar factories, the cost of sugar was relatively reduced, thus accumulating a large amount of capital for the state.

During this season, the factories strengthened planned management and continued to promote several advanced experiences in labor competitions, thus overfulfilling the state plan every month. The main technical indicators of the Shunde, Shitou, Dongguan, and Jieyang sugar factories were all higher than in the previous season. Therefore, although the sugar content of sugarcane was lower than in the previous season, the sugar extraction rate and sugar quality were higher, and the cost was lower than in previous years. The daily sugarcane crushing capacity of the Shunde and Dongguan sugar factories increased to more than 1,580 tons. Compared with the original design capacity (1,000 tons per factory per day), these two factories crushed a total of more than 1,100 tons more per day, equivalent to adding a sugar factory as large as the Shitou Sugar Factory. The Zini Sugar Factory, which went into production this season, fully met or exceeded the main technical indicators. The average daily sugarcane crushing capacity was more than 136 tons higher than the state plan, and the cost in the first quarter of this year was 13.44 percent lower than the state plan.

    广东省五大糖厂增产白糖一万三千多吨
    广东省国营糖厂一九五三年到一九五四年的榨糖季节比上一榨季增产了白糖一万三千五百七十多吨，同时糖的质量也有提高。参加这一榨季榨糖的糖厂，除原有的顺德、市头、东莞、揭阳四个糖厂外，还有新建紫坭糖厂。现在这一榨季已经结束。这一榨季由于各糖厂的产量提高，糖的成本就相对降低，因而为国家积累了大量资金。
    在这个榨季中，各厂加强了计划管理，并在劳动竞赛中继续推广了几种先进经验，因此每月都超额完成国家计划。顺德、市头、东莞、揭阳四个糖厂的主要技术指标都高于上一榨季，所以虽然甘蔗含的糖分比上一榨季低，但是出糖率和糖的质量都比上一榨季高，成本比历年都低。顺德糖厂和东莞糖厂每日榨蔗量提高到一千五百八十吨以上，和原来的设计能力（每厂每日一千吨）比较，这两个厂每天共多榨一千一百多吨，相当于增加了一座像市头糖厂那么大的糖厂。在这个榨季中投入生产的紫坭糖厂，全面地达到或超过了主要技术指标，平均每日榨蔗量比国家计划提高一百三十六吨以上，今年第一季度的成本比国家计划降低了百分之十三点四四。
