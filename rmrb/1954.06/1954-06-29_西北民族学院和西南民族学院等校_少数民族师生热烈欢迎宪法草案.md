Minority teachers and students from Northwestern Nationalities Institute, Xinjiang Nationalities Institute, Qinghai Nationalities Public School and Health School warmly celebrate the promulgation of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Students of Tibetan, Mongolian, Yugur and Tu ethnicities from the 23rd and 24th classes of the cadre training course at Northwestern Nationalities Institute held a forum. They said: In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries did not allow us to use our own ethnic languages or wear our own ethnic costumes. Now, the Draft Constitution stipulates that all ethnic groups are equal, which is a great joyous event in our history. Minority students at Qinghai Nationalities Public School and Health School eagerly took newspapers containing the full text of the Draft Constitution to ask teachers to explain it. Students who understood Chinese voluntarily read the newspaper to students who did not. The school library and reading room were packed with people reading the newspaper. Renqing Huangjia (Tibetan), a teacher at the Health School, explained the content of the Draft Constitution in detail to Tibetan students every day. The minority teachers and students of these two schools also held a forum on the 17th. A Tibetan student from the Health School said: In the past, we didn't even have the right to speak. After liberation, Chairman Mao helped us establish ethnic regional autonomy, become masters of our own affairs, helped us develop production, improved our lives, and sent us from the distant grasslands to schools to study. Now, the Draft Constitution has made clear provisions for these rights we enjoy.
    
    Students of all ethnic groups at Xinjiang Nationalities Institute believe that the content of the Draft Constitution fully conforms to the interests and demands of the people of all ethnic minorities, and they have expressed their intention to celebrate the promulgation of the Draft Constitution with new academic achievements.

Youth and teachers of all ethnic groups at Southwestern Nationalities Institute, Yunnan Nationalities Institute, and Guizhou Nationalities Institute wholeheartedly support the Draft Constitution. At the Southwestern Nationalities Institute in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, all teachers and students, including dozens of ethnic groups such as Tibetan, Yi, Dai, Hui, and Miao, gathered in groups of three or five to read the full text of the Draft Constitution aloud, expressing their joyful feelings to each other. They also collectively wrote a letter to the "Sichuan Daily," which stated: During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, all that lay before our ethnic minorities were prisons and slaughterhouses, discrimination and insult. We did not have the freedom to use our own ethnic languages and scripts, and some of us were even forced to conceal our ethnic identity and names. After liberation, we ethnic minorities lived a life of ethnic equality, freedom and happiness in the great family of the motherland. Now the Draft Constitution explicitly guarantees the happy life that our ethnic minorities have obtained, and we are determined to celebrate the promulgation of the Draft Constitution by strengthening our study of patriotism and ethnic policies and strengthening our actions to promote ethnic unity. In their letter, they also expressed their intention to write letters to publicize the Draft Constitution to the people in their hometowns.

At Yunnan Nationalities Institute and Guizhou Nationalities Institute, a joyous scene was similarly presented. Young men and women of various ethnic groups such as Dai, Miao, Jingpo, Tibetan, and Dong, dressed in their ethnic costumes according to their custom of celebrating ethnic festivals, used different ethnic languages and different ethnic dance forms to express their joy. Hui students at Guizhou Nationalities Institute quickly composed songs to sing the praises of the Draft Constitution. Classes B and C of the Political Research Class at Yunnan Nationalities Institute held a forum. At the meeting, more than one hundred and eighty students from eighteen ethnic groups stated that the great achievements since the founding of the People's Republic of China should be attributed to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    少数民族师生热烈欢迎宪法草案
    西北民族学院、新疆民族学院、青海省民族公学和卫生学校的少数民族师生，热烈庆祝中华人民共和国宪法草案的公布。西北民族学院干部训练班第二十三、二十四两班中的藏、蒙、裕固和土族的同学举行了座谈会。他们说：过去国民党反动派不许我们用本民族的语言，不许我们穿自己的民族服装。现在宪法草案中规定各民族一律平等，这是我们历史上的一件大喜事。青海省民族公学和卫生学校的少数民族学生，纷纷拿着刊登宪法草案全文的报纸去请教师讲解。懂得汉文汉语的学生，自动给不识汉文的学生念报。在学校的图书馆和阅览室里，挤满了读报的人。卫生学校教员仁清黄嘉（藏族）每天都给藏族学生详细讲解宪法草案的内容。这两所学校的少数民族师生，十七日还举行了座谈。卫生学校的藏族学员说：过去我们连说话的权利都没有，解放后，毛主席帮助我们建立民族区域自治，当家作主，帮助我们发展生产，改善了我们的生活，把我们从辽远的草原上送到学校里来念书。现在，宪法草案又把我们享有的这些权利都作了明确的规定。
    新疆民族学院的各族学员，都认为宪法草案的内容完全符合各少数民族人民的利益和要求，纷纷表示要以新的学习成绩来祝贺宪法草案的公布。

    西南民族学院、云南民族学院和贵州民族学院的各族青年及教师，无限欢欣地拥护宪法草案。在四川省成都市西南民族学院，包括藏、彝、傣、回、苗等数十种民族成分的全体师生，三五成群地聚在一起朗读宪法草案全文，彼此倾吐欢乐的心情。他们还集体写信给“四川日报”，信上说道：在国民党反动统治时期，摆在我们少数民族面前的只有监狱和屠场，歧视和侮辱。我们没有使用本民族语言文字的自由，在我们中间有的人就曾经被迫隐瞒自己的民族成分和姓名。解放后，我们少数民族在祖国大家庭中，过着民族平等自由幸福的生活。现在宪法草案又明文保障我们少数民族所得到的幸福生活，我们坚决以加强爱国主义和民族政策的学习、加强民族团结的行动，来庆祝宪法草案的公布。他们在信上还表示将要写信向家乡人民宣传宪法草案。
    在云南民族学院、贵州民族学院，也同样呈现着欢乐的景象。傣族、苗族、景颇族、藏族、侗族等各民族青年男女，按照自己过民族节日的习惯，换上了民族盛装，用不同民族的语言和不同民族形式的舞蹈，来表达欢乐的心情。贵州民族学院的回族学员，很快地编出歌曲，歌唱宪法草案。云南民族学院政治研究班乙、丙两班举行了座谈会，会上，包括十八种民族成分的一百八十多个学员，纷纷表示：应该把中华人民共和国成立以来的各项伟大成就，归功于中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导。（新华社）
