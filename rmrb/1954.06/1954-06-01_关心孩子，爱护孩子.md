Children's Paradise

	By the lake in Beihai Park, Beijing, there is a children's paradise called "The Young Pioneer's Home." Every Saturday and Sunday, Young Pioneers in their best clothes, with red scarves around their necks, come here to participate in literary, scientific, and sports activities. Passing tourists often hear the laughter and chatter of children from outside the red walls of this palace-like building.

	There are six groups: biology, art, chemistry, physics, aviation models, and music. Children can join a group according to their interests. Children who love biology can dig, weed, and plant various plants in the botanical garden. Through practical operation, they learn a lot of scientific knowledge and appreciate the value of labor. Their biology room displays various animal and plant specimens, as well as their homemade small microscopes. Pictures of Darwin and Michurin hang on the walls of the room, along with Michurin's famous saying: "We cannot wait for nature to bestow favors; it is our task to wrest favors from it." In a room on the other side of the courtyard, pictures of aircraft models hang on the walls, along with tools, materials, and design drawings, resembling a small aircraft model manufacturing factory. The members of the aviation model group have made many catapult, fuselage traction, and gasoline-powered aircraft models. This year, on June 1st International Children's Day, they are preparing to give wonderful performances for the children of the capital.

	The music room and art room are even more charming. The music group is the largest group in the "Young Pioneer's Home," including a choir of more than one hundred people, a band, and a dance troupe. With the help of instructors, some children are practicing composing songs. The music group often performs in factories and schools in the capital, and also often broadcasts on the radio. In the art room, children's own works are displayed: pencil drawings, watercolors, sculptures, plaster statues, beautiful paper cuttings, and girls' drawnwork, embroidery, and printed calico. From these dazzling artistic works, we can see that children have been able to find creative themes from life.

	Children often bring the knowledge they have learned from the "Young Pioneer's Home" back to school to tell their friends, arousing everyone's interest in science and art. Therefore, they have become the backbone of extracurricular activities in schools.

	In order to get in touch with more children, the "Young Pioneer's Home" also often holds science performance meetings, concerts, children's painting competitions, etc., or invites famous model workers, combat heroes, scientists, and artists to meet with children and tell them stories.

	The children of the capital love this paradise and regard it as their home.

The Cradle of Dancers

	On the south bank of the beautiful Shichahai in Beijing, lives a group of young dancers—the children of the Central Experimental Opera House Folk Opera Troupe. They come from all corners of the motherland; among them are the children of workers and cadres, as well as orphans from the Shanghai Rehabilitation Institute.

	They live and study happily together here. Every morning at seven o'clock, they get up to practice the basic movements of Chinese classical dance. After breakfast, the children gather in the courtyard covered with velvet carpets to learn the main course—Chinese classical dance. Their teachers include nationally renowned Kunqu Opera actors Han Shichang, Bai Yunsheng, and Ma Xianglin. Now, they have completed the Chinese classical dance combination and are practicing fragments from Chinese classical opera and dance dramas—such as the movements of "Qi Ba." The last lesson in the morning is basic training in Soviet ballet. The children changed into another set of beautiful dance clothes and practiced to the melody of a graceful waltz; every movement and every posture was so beautiful and full of lyricism. In the afternoon, there are cultural studies, piano practice, and music appreciation courses.

	The children's interests are diverse. In addition to dancing, they also participate in various other activities, such as sports, watching movies, traveling, and reading literary novels (they have their own library). Every evening, the children go to play on the earthen hills of Shichahai or in the Children's Park in groups of three or five. On Sundays, the children wear beautiful clothes, tie bright red scarves, and go boating or travel to the suburbs together.

	The feelings between teachers and children are very harmonious. Teachers love them like their own children; and the children can also listen to the teachers. They often sit around the teachers and listen to stories affectionately. Once, a child asked a teacher who taught Chinese classical opera and dance drama naively: "Teacher, did you learn ballet before?" The teacher sighed and replied: "Oh! Silly child, I have never even heard of it, let alone learned it. At that time, we couldn't get enough to eat or wear, and we suffered countless beatings and scoldings. The money we earned went into other people's pockets. At that time, there were no classrooms or mirrors, so we could only sneak out alone at night to practice in the moonlight or by candlelight... Alas, compared to you, there is a world of difference..." These words left a deep impression on the children's hearts, making them understand that they should love the motherland and love the art of dance.

"Mother-Child Train"

	More than 30 first-class stations across the country have established waiting rooms specifically for mothers and children. In the spacious and bright waiting room, there are free small beds, bedding, and toys for children, and attendants to help take care of the children. When boarding, passengers with children can enter the station first. The attendants of the People's Train wait at the entrance of the platform and guide them to the train. There are also small hammocks with safety nets, portable toilets, and toys for children to use on the train. If a child gets sick, medical personnel will come to diagnose them.

	The comrades of the train attendants are very responsible for their work. As soon as the train arrives at the station, he first goes down to help the women with their luggage and children; at the same time, he finds seats for the mothers who get on the train. Then, he walks up to each passenger, finds out her name, where she is going, and what she is carrying, and records them in his diary; he asks more detailed questions to some illiterate women. When it is time for someone to get off the train, he informs them in advance to prepare their luggage. When the children are sleeping, he carefully checks the hooks, safety nets, and straps of each hammock. If the child cries, he will help the mothers coax the children to play.

	Once, a mother vomited badly because of motion sickness, and the child was crying beside her because he was hungry. At this time, the attendant on this train hurriedly found the medical worker to diagnose the mother; at the same time, he ran around asking another mother to breastfeed the little baby. After the little baby was full and fell asleep, he breathed a sigh of relief and a smile reappeared on his face.

	Someone asked the attendant: Aren't you tired? He replied softly: "It's nothing, this is my duty. The people entrusted the children to me, so I must be fully responsible for them. I am already the father of four children, and I deeply understand the difficulties of being a parent. Especially the families of workers, military personnel, and rural women, most of them are illiterate and have never been far from home, so they feel a lot of inconvenience when they leave home. I feel extremely honored to be able to serve the second generation of the motherland."

Warm Homes for Orphans

	Beijing No. 1 Children's Welfare Institute is the largest children's welfare institute in China. It houses 347 children, all of whom are lonely orphans without fathers or mothers.

	Before the People's Government took over, the children in the institute did not receive nutritious food and good care, and many infants often fell ill. Now, the children's living conditions have undergone fundamental changes. They can eat milk, egg yolks, cod liver oil, calcium tablets, fruits, etc., and there is an average of one childcare worker for every three infants. The little babies are growing up lively and strong. Children from three to seven years old also receive a certain amount of early childhood education.

	For example, in the elementary school department (which houses children over the age of seven), in the past, 59.3% of the children were malnourished, and more than 95% of the children's height and weight did not meet the standards, and the children's mental health was not normal. They were often forced to perform hard labor. In winter, the children knelt on the cold tile floor and wiped the floor with cold water, and many of them suffered from arthritis as a result. Now, the children not only have their own medical room, but also a sanatorium. On the eve of June 1st International Children's Day, the children held an exhibition of their study and homework achievements, displaying the small clothes, woolen sweaters, drawnwork, embroidery, woodworking, and matchboxes they made themselves. Some of them were made by the older children for the younger brothers and sisters in the infant department; some were processed for the outside. Now, thanks to good nutrition, the children's physical and mental health have developed normally.

	The children love the motherland, love learning, and love labor. In the past two years, more than 150 people have graduated from here and gone to work. Some of them go to factories to work, and some go to Inner Mongolia to work as nurses. Many people have received good comments in their work. They often write letters to their younger brothers and sisters in the institute from their posts, encouraging them to study hard and expressing their determination to create a better and happier life with their own labor.

Children's Treasure Trove of Knowledge

	The Beijing Library has established close ties with the vast number of young readers in the capital, and it often provides young readers with rich spiritual food.

	Every year from late spring to early autumn, the library opens the southwest corner of the courtyard as a children's reading garden. On holidays or after school, children can come here to read their favorite books. At the same time, a reading room with more than 100 seats has been opened specifically for young children, and more than 70,800 young readers came here last year.

	The library also often holds book exhibitions to introduce new books to children. In addition, young readers are often invited to report to their friends their experiences in reading "How Steel Was Tempered," "An Ordinary Soldier," "Guria's Road," "My Son," and "The Story of Zoya and Shura."

	In order to cultivate the noble qualities of young children, the library often holds "meet-and-greets" for young readers, inviting the mother of hero Huang Jiguang—Mother Deng Fangzhi, literary soldier Gao Yubao, volunteer army blasting hero Huang Jiafu, China's Paul Kochakin Wu Yunduo, etc. to meet with the children. Heroes, role models, poets, writers, scientists, artists and young readers are also invited to a get-together, including scientists Gao Shiqi, famous actress Shi Lianxing, and poet Tian Jian.

	The children regard the library as their paradise, and the Young Pioneers often come here to spend their team day. Many young readers actively participate in various activities of the library and help the reading group with their work, becoming good assistants to the library. They enthusiastically handle borrowing procedures for young readers, set up exhibitions, publish wall newspapers, etc.

	Now, the library is building a book storage. After it is reopened this fall, it will further strengthen tutoring activities and establish more regular contact with various schools, so that the extracurricular reading of young readers can be better combined with the schoolwork. (Attached picture)

    关心孩子，爱护孩子

    孩子们的乐园
    在北京北海公园的湖边，有一个儿童乐园——“少年之家”。每逢星期六和星期日，穿着盛装，颈上系着红领巾的少先队员，都到这里来参加文艺、科学、体育等活动。游客们从这座宫殿建筑的红色围墙外面经过时，常常可以听到孩子的嬉戏谈笑声。
    这里设立了生物、美工、化学、物理、航空模型和音乐等六个小组。孩子们可以按照自己的兴趣参加一个小组。爱好生物学的儿童可以在植物园里挖土、拔草，栽植种种的植物。从实地操作中，他们学得很多的科学知识，并体会到劳动的可贵。在他们的生物室里陈列着各式各样的动植物标本，以及他们自制的小型显微镜。室内墙壁上挂着达尔文、米丘林的像片，还有米丘林的名言：“我们不能等待大自然赐给恩惠；向它夺取恩惠——才是我们的任务”。在院子另一边的一间屋子里，墙壁上挂着飞机模型的图片，还有工具、材料、设计图样等，好像一座小型的飞机模型制造工厂。航空模型小组的组员们，制成了很多弹射式、舱身牵引和汽油动力等飞机模型。今年“六一”国际儿童节，他们准备给首都的小朋友们作精彩的表演。
    音乐室和美工室更别有风致。音乐小组是“少年之家”中最大的一个组，它包括一个百余人的合唱队，一个乐队和一个舞蹈团。在指导员的帮助下，有的孩子正在练习创作歌曲。音乐小组常到首都各工厂和学校演出，也常在电台广播。在美工室里陈列着儿童们自己的作品：铅笔画、水彩画、雕刻、石膏塑像、美妙的剪纸和刻纸手工，以及女孩子们的挑花、刺绣和印染花布。从这些琳琅满目的艺术作品中，我们可以看出孩子们已能从生活中寻找创作的题材。
    儿童们常常把从“少年之家”学得的知识带回学校去，告诉小伙伴们，引起了大家对科学和艺术的兴趣。因此，他们已成为学校中开展课外活动的骨干。
    为了和更多的儿童取得联系，“少年之家”还经常举办科学表演会、音乐会、儿童绘画比赛等活动，或请著名的劳动模范、战斗英雄、科学家和艺术家和孩子们见面，给他们讲故事。
    首都的少年儿童都热爱这个乐园，把它当做自己的家。
    舞蹈家的摇篮
    在北京风景秀丽的什刹海的南岸，住着一批少年舞蹈家——中央实验歌剧院民间戏曲团的儿童学员。他们来自祖国的各个角落；其中有工人和干部的子女，也有上海教养院里的孤儿。
    他们在这里一起愉快地生活着学习着。每天早晨七点钟，他们就起来练习中国古典舞的基本动作。早餐以后，孩子们都集中在铺着天鹅绒地毯的院子里，学习主要的课程——中国古典舞。教他们的老师，有全国著名的昆曲演员韩世昌、白云生、马祥麟等。现在，他们已经学完了中国古典舞舞蹈组合，正在练习中国古典歌舞剧中的片断——“起霸”等动作。上午最后一堂课是苏联芭蕾舞的基本训练。孩子们换上了另一套漂亮的舞衣，按着幽美的圆舞曲的旋律进行练习；每个动作、每个姿态都是那么的美妙和富有抒情味。下午有文化学习、钢琴练习和音乐欣赏等课程。
    孩子们的兴趣是多种多样的，除了舞蹈之外，他们还参加其他各种活动，如运动、看电影、旅行、读文艺小说（他们自己有个图书馆）。每天傍晚，孩子们三五成群地到什刹海的土山上或儿童公园去玩。星期天，孩子们都穿起美丽的服装，系着鲜艳的红领巾，一起去划船或到郊外旅行。
    老师们和孩子们之间的感情显得非常融洽。老师爱他们像自己的孩子一样；而孩子们也能听老师的话，他们常常亲昵地围坐在老师身边听讲故事。有一次一个孩子天真地问一个教中国古典舞剧的老师：“老师，你们以前学不学芭蕾舞？”老师感叹地回答：“咳！傻孩子，听都没听说过，不用说学了。那时吃不饱穿不暖，不知挨过多少打骂，赚来的钱都归了别人的腰包。那会儿没有教室也没有镜子，晚上只能悄悄地一个人起来在月亮下或点着残烛练习。……唉，比起你们来真有天地之别……”这些话在孩子们的心里留下了深刻的印象，使他们懂得了应该热爱祖国、热爱舞蹈艺术。
      “母子列车”
    全国三十几个一等以上的车站，专为母亲和孩子设立了候车室。在宽敞明亮的候车室里，有免费供儿童使用的小床、被褥和玩具等，还有服务员帮助照管孩子。上车时，携带孩子的旅客可以优先进站。人民列车的服务员等在月台的入口处，把他们引到列车上去。车上也有专供儿童使用的带有安全网的小吊床、便盆和玩具等设备。孩子有了病，卫生人员便来给他们诊断。
    列车上的服务员同志，对工作非常负责。车一到站，他就先下去帮助妇女们拿行李，抱孩子；同时给上车的母亲找坐位。随后，他就走到每个乘客面前，把她的姓名、要去的地方和带的东西都打听清楚，记在日记本上；对一些不识字的妇女，问得更是详细。到时候谁该下车了，他都事先通知对方把行李准备好。孩子们睡觉时，他对每个吊铺的挂钩、安全网和吊带，都仔细地检查一遍。如果孩子哭闹起来，他就来帮着母亲们哄孩子们玩。
    有一次一位母亲因晕车吐得很厉害，孩子在旁边饿得直哭。这时，这一列车上的服务员急忙把卫生员找来给母亲诊治；同时，他又四处奔走，请另一位妈妈给那个小宝宝喂奶。待小宝宝吃饱睡熟之后，他才松了口气，脸上重又露出了笑容。
    有人问那位服务员：你不累吗？他轻轻地回答：“没啥，这是我本分的事，人民把孩子委托给我，我就要对他们完全负责。我已是四个孩子的爸爸，我可深深地了解当父母的不容易。特别是工人家属、军属和乡村妇女，她们多不识字，又没出过远门，离开家便感到很多不方便。我能为祖国的第二代服务，感到无上的光荣。”
    孤儿们的温暖家庭
    北京市第一儿童教养院，是我国规模最大的一个儿童教养院。这里收容了三百四十七个孩子，他们都是孤苦伶仃、无爹无妈的孤儿。
    在人民政府接管以前，院里的孩子们得不到有营养的食品和好的护理，有很多幼婴常常患病。现在，孩子们的生活情况有了根本的改变，他们可以吃到牛奶、蛋黄、鱼肝油、钙片、水果等，平均每三个婴儿就有一个保育员。小宝贝们都长得又活泼又结实。从三岁到七岁的孩子还受着一定的幼儿教育。
    例如，小学部（收容七岁以上的孩子）过去有百分之五十九点三的孩子营养不良，百分之九十五以上的儿童体高体重不合标准，孩子的精神也不够正常。他们常常被迫服劳役。冬天，儿童们跪在冰冷的磁砖地上用凉水擦地，有很多因而得了关节炎。现在，孩子们不仅有了自己的医疗室，而且还有休养所。在“六一”国际儿童节前夕，孩子们举办了一个学习和作业成绩展览会，展出了他们自己做的小衣裤、毛线衣、挑补花和绣花手工、木工、火柴盒等。其中有的是大孩子给幼婴部的弟弟妹妹们做的；有的是给外面加工的。现在，孩子们由于营养良好，身心健康都得到了正常的发展。
    孩子们都热爱祖国、热爱学习和劳动。二年多来，从这里毕业出去参加工作的已有一百五十多人。他们有的到工厂去做工，有的到内蒙古地区做护士工作。有不少人在工作中得到了好评。他们时常从工作岗位上给院里的弟弟妹妹来信，勉励他们好好学习，并表示决心以自己的劳动创造美好幸福的生活。
    小朋友们的知识宝库
    北京图书馆已和首都广大的少年儿童读者们建立了亲密的联系，它经常供给小读者以丰富的精神食粮。
    每年春末到秋初，图书馆把院内的西南角辟为儿童阅览园。假日或课余，小朋友们可以到这里来看自己所喜爱的书籍。同时，又特为少年儿童开辟了一间拥有一百多座位的阅览室，去年到这里的小读者达七万零八百多人。
    图书馆还经常举办图书展览，向孩子们介绍新书。此外，还经常请小读者向小朋友们报告阅读“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“普通一兵”、“古丽雅的道路”、“我的儿子”、“卓娅与舒拉的故事”等作品的心得。
    为了培养少年儿童的高贵品质，图书馆常为小读者举办“见面会”，请英雄黄继光的母亲——邓芳芝妈妈、文艺战士高玉宝、志愿军爆破英雄黄家富、中国的保尔·柯察金吴运铎等与小朋友们见面。还邀请英雄、模范、诗人、作家、科学家、艺术家和少年读者们联欢，其中有科学家高士其、名演员石联星、诗人田间等。
    孩子们把图书馆看做自己的乐园，少先队员们也常到这里来过队日。许多小读者积极参加图书馆的各种活动，帮阅览组做工作，成为图书馆的良好助手。他们为小读者热情地办理借阅手续，布置展览会，出版壁报等。
    现在，图书馆正在兴建书库。今秋重新开放后，将进一步加强辅导活动，并和各学校取得较经常的联系，使小读者的课外阅读和校内功课更好地结合起来。（附图片）
