    Summer wool from Hotan, Kashgar and other regions in southern Xinjiang Province is gradually entering the market. Herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the northern regions of Yili, Tacheng, and Altay are beginning to shear sheep.

    The wool from Xinjiang Province's sheep is of good quality, including the nationally renowned "Xinjiang sheep" wool, which is lustrous in color and has fine, long fibers. Trade companies in various parts of Xinjiang Province have successively organized many mobile trade teams to go deep into pastoral areas to purchase wool and other animal by-products. Nearly two hundred mobile trade teams are now in the Tianshan, Altay mountain areas, and grasslands. There are more than ninety mobile trade teams in the Altay, Tacheng, and Yili regions, the three regions with the highest wool production in Xinjiang Province. These mobile trade teams are supplying herdsmen of all ethnic groups with various fabrics, tea, sugar, general merchandise, and production tools.
