Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, June 11th: The newly built state-owned Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory has reached a considerably high level of production during its trial operation. Since the trial operation began on March 5th, just over three months ago, the cotton yarn output per thousand spindles per hour has reached over 26.5 kilograms, exceeding the average production level of textile factories in the Central and South China region. The quality of the yarn largely meets the Class A standards stipulated in the new standards of the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, and Class C yarn has disappeared. The amount of cotton used for spinning is decreasing day by day. In May, the amount of cotton used per piece of yarn was more than 5 kilograms lower than in March, and more than 1 kilogram lower than the factory's annual planned control figure. The production situation in the weaving workshop is also very good. The output per loom per hour is stable at about four yards. The woven cloth has a smooth and even surface, and the rate of first-grade cloth had already exceeded the annual planned target by more than 6 percent by the end of May and is continuing to improve. Based on this good trial production situation, the Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory has been approved by the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government to officially begin production in July, and it has been decided to hold a grand opening ceremony on July 1st, the anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party.

　　Tens of thousands of bolts of cotton cloth produced by the factory during the trial operation have already been supplied to markets in Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xuchang, Nanyang, Xinyang and other regions. Many farmers wore shirts made of white sheeting from the Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory during the wheat harvest. Some factory nurseries used the factory's white cloth to make new bed sheets. Consumers praised the factory's cloth for its white color, sufficient size, even warp and weft, and said it was no worse than the "Dragon Head" fine cloth from Shanghai. The Henan Provincial Company of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has listed the factory's cloth as one of the standard cloths on the Henan market. In the past, most of the machine-woven white cloth needed in Henan Province was transported from Shanghai and other places. It took at least ten days from the time the goods were purchased to the time they reached the sales location, which not only often affected the timeliness of supply, but also consumed a lot of transportation costs and occupied railway cars. After the Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory goes into production, it will supply a large amount of cloth to nearby markets, which will be of great benefit to both consumers and the country.

    郑州第一棉纺织厂试车生产的情况很好
    【新华社开封十一日电】新建的国营郑州第一棉纺织厂在试车期间，生产已达到相当高的水平。这个厂从三月五日开始试车以来，到现在刚刚三个月多几天，每千个锭子每小时的棉纱产量已达到二十六点五公斤以上，超过了目前中南区各纺织厂的平均生产水平。纱的质量，大部分达到中央人民政府纺织工业部所规定的新标准中的甲等标准，丙等纱已经绝迹。纺纱用棉量一天天减少，五月份每件纱的用棉量就比三月份减低了五公斤多，比这个厂年度计划的控制数也减低了一公斤多。织布车间的生产情况也很好。每台织布机每小时的产量稳定在四码左右，织出来的布，布面平整、光润，正布率在五月底已经超过年度计划指标的百分之六以上，现在正继续提高。根据试车生产良好的这种情况，郑州第一棉纺织厂已得到中央人民政府纺织工业部批准，从七月份起转入正式生产，并决定在“七一”中国共产党的诞生纪念日举行盛大的开工生产典礼。
    这个厂在试车期间所生产的棉布，已有几万疋供应郑州、洛阳、许昌、南阳、信阳等地区的市场了。许多农民在麦收期间穿上了用郑州第一棉纺织厂的白细布做成的衬衣。有的工厂的托儿所用这个厂的白布做了新被单。消费者都称赞这个厂的布疋颜色白，尺码足，经纬均匀，不比上海来的龙头细布差。中国花纱布公司河南省公司已把这个厂的布列为河南市场上的标准布之一。过去河南省需要的机织白布大部是从上海等地运来，从进货到运达销售地点最短也得十几天，这不但往往影响供应不及时，而且消耗了很多运输费用，占用了火车车皮。郑州第一棉纺织厂投入生产后以大量的布疋供应附近市场，对消费者和对国家都有很大好处。
