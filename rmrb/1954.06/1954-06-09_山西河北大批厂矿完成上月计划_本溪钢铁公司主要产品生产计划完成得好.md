Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 8th: One hundred and nineteen state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in Shanxi Province exceeded the state production plan for May. Twenty-two major products, including electricity, raw coal, pig iron, steel, steel products, cement, and cotton cloth, all exceeded their targets.

The completion of the state-mandated total output value and the output of major products by various factories and mines in May was better than in April. There was also new progress in comprehensively completing indicators such as labor productivity, cost, and quality. According to existing statistics alone: labor productivity in thirty-five units, including Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Datong Power Plant, Shanxi Machine Factory, and Jinhua Textile Factory, all increased compared to the original plan. Product costs in six units, including Dongshan Coal Mine and Shanxi Chemical Plant, decreased by 4.06% to 22.45% compared to the original plan in May, saving the state more than 2.31 billion yuan. The quality of all products from Yuncheng Chemical Plant, Datong and Yuci Flour Mills, and other units were completely up to standard.

The technical innovation movement in various factories and mines in Shanxi Province made new progress in May. After the thorough dissemination of Anshan Iron and Steel's technical innovation experience, there was a surge in rationalization proposals put forward by workers. In major factories and mines such as Datong Mining Bureau, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, Shanxi Machine Factory, and Taiyuan Cement Plant, the rationalization proposals put forward by workers in May exceeded or were almost equal to the total number from January to April. This powerfully guaranteed the completion of the state plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 7th: One hundred and fifty state-owned, local state-owned, and joint state-private factories, mines, and enterprises in Hebei Province completed and overfulfilled the state production plan for May.

The factories and mines that completed and overfulfilled the state production plan include Kailuan Coal Mine, the state-owned Tangshan Steel Plant, Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant, Tangshan Power Plant, Longyan Iron Mine, Fengfeng Coal Mine, Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory, Zhangjiakou Mining Machinery Plant, Zhangjiakou Prospecting Machinery Plant, and the local state-owned Zhangjiakou Machinery Plant, Zhangjiakou Oil Factory, Shijiazhuang Cotton Textile Factory, and the joint state-private Tangshan Huaxin Textile Factory. The state-owned Shijiazhuang No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, which officially started production on May 1st, International Labor Day, also exceeded the May production plan, with cotton cloth reaching 110.53%.

In May, Hebei Province's major industrial products, including steel ingots, steel, oil steel, coal, pig iron, iron ore, electricity, cotton cloth, cotton yarn, and glass, all completed the state production plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, 8th: From January to May, Benxi Iron and Steel Company achieved its production plan for twelve major products, including steel, iron, coke, and refractory materials, every month. In May, pig iron production reached 101.8%, steel products reached 108.2%, and coke reached 104.8%. These products were supplied to meet the needs of national construction in a timely manner.

In addition to the product plan, Benxi Iron and Steel Company has also completed its plans for total output value, quality, and cost reduction relatively well in recent months, basically achieving comprehensive over-fulfillment of the plan. The total industrial output value plan for the first quarter was completed by 109.6%, the labor productivity plan was completed by 111.3%, and the quality of various products reached the standards stipulated by the state.

The continuous completion of various major product plans for five consecutive months is a new phenomenon that Benxi Iron and Steel Company has never experienced before. This situation shows that the management level of the various factories and mines under Benxi Iron and Steel Company has improved compared to the past. In order to ensure the comprehensive over-fulfillment of the plan, the blast furnace workshop formulated a system for daily checking the completion of production, quality, and cost plans. Last year, the product cost of this workshop often exceeded the budget, but in the past five months, the cost has decreased month by month.

    山西河北大批厂矿完成上月计划
    本溪钢铁公司主要产品生产计划完成得好
     【新华社太原八日电】山西省一百一十九个国营、地方国营厂矿超额完成五月份国家生产计划。电力、原煤、生铁、钢、钢材、水泥、棉布等二十二种主要产品，都全部超额完成。
    五月份各厂矿完成国家规定的总产值和主要产品产量都比四月份好，在全面地完成劳动生产率、成本、质量等指标方面也有新的进步。仅据现有材料统计：太原钢铁厂、大同发电厂、山西机器厂、晋华纺织厂等三十五个单位，劳动生产率都比原计划提高。东山煤矿、山西化学厂等六个单位，五月份的产品成本比原计划降低百分之四点零六到百分之二十二点四五，共给国家节约资金达二十三亿一千多万元。运城化工厂、大同和榆次面粉厂等单位，全部产品质量都完全合格。
    山西省各厂矿的技术革新运动五月份有了新的进展。各厂矿深入传达鞍钢技术革新经验后，职工提出的合理化建议激增。大同矿务局、太原矿山机器厂、山西机器厂、太原水泥厂等主要厂矿，五月份职工提出的合理化建议就超过或几乎等于一到四月份的总数。这就有力地保证了国家计划的完成。
    【新华社保定七日电】河北省一百五十个国营、地方国营、公私合营厂矿、企业单位，完成和超额完成了五月份国家生产计划。
    完成和超额完成国家生产计划的工厂和矿山有开滦煤矿、国营的唐山钢厂、唐山机车车辆修理厂、唐山发电厂、龙烟铁矿、峰峰煤矿、山海关桥梁工厂、张家口矿山机械厂、张家口探矿机械厂和地方国营张家口机械厂、张家口油厂、石家庄棉纺织厂，公私合营唐山华新纺织厂等，“五一”国际劳动节正式开始生产的国营石家庄第一棉纺织厂，也超额完成了五月份生产计划，棉布完成百分之一百一十点五三。
    五月份河北省的主要工业产品，有钢锭、钢材、油脂钢、煤、生铁、铁矿砂、电、棉布、棉纱、玻璃等都完成了国家生产计划。
    【新华社本溪八日电】本溪钢铁公司从一月到五月，每月都实现了钢、铁、焦炭、耐火材料等十二种主要产品的生产计划。五月份，生铁产量完成百分之一百零一点八，钢材完成百分之一百零八点二，焦炭完成百分之一百零四点八。这些产品及时地供应了国家建设的需要。
    除了产品计划以外，本溪钢铁公司几个月来的生产总值、质量、降低成本等计划也完成得比较好，基本上做到了全面超额地完成计划。第一季度工业总产值计划完成百分之一百零九点六，劳动生产率计划完成百分之一百十一点三，各种产品的质量都达到了国家规定的标准。
    连续五个月完成各项主要产品计划，这是本溪钢铁公司过去从未有过的新景象。这个情况说明本溪钢铁公司所属各厂矿的管理水平已经比过去提高了一步。高炉车间为了保证全面超额完成计划，订出了每日检查产量、质量、成本计划完成情况的制度。去年这个车间的产品成本经常超支，今年五个月来成本一个月比一个月降低。
