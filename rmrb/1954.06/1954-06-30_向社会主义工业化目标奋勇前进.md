    Strive Valiantly Towards the Goal of Socialist Industrialization
    
    Equipment Installation Project at Taiyuan Power Plant Proceeding Intensely
    
    The equipment installation project at the newly built Taiyuan Power Plant is being accelerated. This year, the workers at the plant must install thousands of tons of machinery and equipment in just a few months, some of which weigh thirty to forty tons and need to be hoisted to heights of over twenty meters for installation. Therefore, the plant's employees attach great importance to adopting mechanized installation methods. Far in advance of the installation preparation stage, the plant mobilized 187 units of equipment including 24-meter-high surrounding pipe trucks, cold bending pipe machines, universal plate shearing machines, and various lathes. The workers quickly learned how to use these machines, greatly accelerating the progress of combined installation preparation. Since the plant began on-site installation in May, it has successively mobilized various machines. Currently, there are as many as sixteen cranes, including 30-ton tank cranes, 40-meter tower cranes good at lifting, light and fast truck cranes, and new Soviet-style gantry cranes.
    
    In actual operation, the plant's employees demonstrated pioneering spirit and tapped the potential of machinery. For example, when installing the huge boiler steel frame, railway cranes and heavy tank cranes cooperated, adopting the method of front lifting and rear pushing, and dragging off the ground, quickly transporting the boiler steel frame from outside the factory to inside the factory, not only saving a large amount of labor and ensuring construction safety, but also completing the installation task four days ahead of schedule. Now, the bridge-type traveling crane in the turbine hall has been installed under the guidance of Soviet experts. Employees are preparing to use it to lift the assembled steam turbine and generator, and strive to generate partial electricity in November.
    
    Second Phase of Construction Begins at Heilongjiang Thermal Power Plant
    
    After the first phase of civil construction of the Heilongjiang Thermal Power Plant began in early July last year, it is now entering the completion stage. The second phase of civil construction, after long preparations, began successively in late May and early June.
    
    The riverside pumping station in the second phase of the project will replace the cooling tower (or cooling pond) of a general thermal power plant, directly utilizing natural river water, which will greatly reduce electricity costs. The construction of this project is extremely arduous. From the Nen River bank to the river center over a hundred meters away, a bow-shaped dam (cofferdam) must first be built. The cofferdam requires three thousand cubic meters of wood and tens of thousands of cubic meters of earth and rubble. All work must be carried out by divers. After the cofferdam is built, the river water will be drained, and the pumping station will be built at the bottom of the river.
    
    Now, the newly started projects are progressing at an amazing speed. At the riverside pumping station construction site, workers are operating powerful excavators and bulldozers day and night. Carpenters are rushing to make wooden cages for the cofferdam, the first section of which has been assembled and installed in the water. They will complete the cofferdam project before the flood season. At the chimney construction site, tall iron towers stand tall, and newly installed mixers are rotating all day long. Under the workers' hard work, the chimney is extending higher and higher, section by section.
    
    Two Open-Hearth Furnaces in New Steelmaking Plant at Factory 101 Put into Production
    
    Following the commissioning of Open-Hearth Furnace No. 2, Open-Hearth Furnace No. 1 in the newly built steelmaking plant at Factory 101 also began tapping steel on June 12.
    
    Furnace No. 1 was ignited for baking on May 18. Before preparing for smelting, the employees of the new steelmaking plant summarized the experiences and lessons learned from the commissioning of Furnace No. 2, and conscientiously made preparations before the start of the furnace. Therefore, throughout the entire smelting process, the situation inside the furnace was normal.
    
    Now, the new steelmaking plant has officially compiled a production plan, and the newly produced steel ingots are being sent continuously to the rolling mill and other steel plants. The steel strip mill has used steel ingots from the new steelmaking plant to roll out a large number of flat steel and angle steel to meet the construction needs of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. The rail mill is also stepping up the experiment of directly rolling heavy steel rails from the steel ingots of the new steelmaking plant. After the experiment is successful, it will no longer be necessary to transport steel billets from Anshan, thousands of miles away, to roll steel rails.
    
    Intense Construction of Gulangxia Project on Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway
    
    The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway construction project is advancing rapidly westward, and the Gulangxia project is under intense construction.
    
    Gulangxia is the gateway to the west of Wushaoling. Two steep mountain peaks stand facing each other, forming a narrow canyon ten kilometers long (the narrowest point is only sixty meters). The Gansu-Xinjiang Highway and the Gulang River pass through the canyon. In order not to affect the normal passage of the highway and to complete the railway construction task on time, two major projects of relocating the highway and building the railway are being carried out simultaneously. Since the project started on May 1, as of early June, 50% of the main project has been completed, 150,000 cubic meters of earth and stone have been completed for the railway line, and the highway relocation project will also be completed by the end of June.
    
    Anhui Paper Mill Begins Production of Cigarette Paper
    
    The newly built state-owned Anhui Paper Mill began producing cigarette paper on June 18. At ten o'clock in the morning on the 18th, when the paper machine spit out the first foot of cigarette paper, the workers, filled with joy, some took the cigarette paper to a special balance to weigh it, and some looked at the beautiful patterns in the paper against the light. The cigarette paper produced on the first day was inspected and the quality met the national standards. In the future, this new type of paper factory will produce a large quantity of high-quality cigarette paper to meet the needs of the cigarette industry in various places.
    
    Baoji Power Plant to Begin Construction Soon
    
    The construction project of the local state-owned Shaanxi Baoji Power Plant will start in July and is expected to be completed and supply electricity in the first quarter of next year. In recent years, various industries and transportation industries in the Baoji area have developed greatly, especially the construction of the Baocheng Railway, which will bring greater prosperity to Baoji's industry and commerce. Therefore, the demand for electricity is also increasing. After the Baoji Power Plant is built and generates electricity, many auxiliary agencies of the Baocheng Railway, such as locomotive and vehicle depots and material factories, can obtain electricity supply from here; the power consumption of some small-scale industries in Baoji City, such as oil pressing factories, cigarette factories, and bobbin factories, and the urban lighting of Baoji will also be further satisfied. In addition, it will also draw a part of the electricity to supply the expanded needs of various factories of the Xinqin Company to solve the difficulties of insufficient power supply of the power plants under the company.
    
    Main Factory Buildings of Nan'an Sugar Factory in Fujian Start Construction
    
    The main factory building project of the Nan'an Sugar Factory, jointly invested by the Fujian Provincial People's Government and local patriotic overseas Chinese, began construction on June 18. The Design Engineering Company of the Light Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Light Industry specially transferred more than 130 engineering and technical personnel from Guangdong to the construction site to guide the construction. More than 500 employees of the Jinjiang Construction Company have also entered the construction site. At present, seamless steel pipes produced by Angang, raw steel from Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, light rails from Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant, as well as special-shaped refractory bricks produced in Hunan, copper wire plates produced by Shanghai Chemical Plant, etc., needed for construction have been successively transported to the site, and a complete set of mechanical sugar extraction equipment has also been purchased in Guangdong.
    
    A New Forest Railway Built Under Changbai Mountain
    
    A new forest railway has begun to be built under Changbai Mountain in Northeast China since May this year. The roadbed is more than a hundred miles long, extending from the Dashitou lumber yard into the Southwest Cha logging area under Changbai Mountain. The railway is surrounded by dense forests and mountains, rich in various precious tree species such as red pine, larch, and cedar. After this railway is built, it can transport a large amount of wood to supply the construction needs of various parts of the country.
    
    Now, more than 2,000 employees are building this railway in a tense and pleasant atmosphere. They proposed to complete the entire railway construction project before the National Day this year.

    向社会主义工业化目标奋勇前进
    太原发电厂设备安装工程紧张进行
    新建太原发电厂设备安装工程正加紧进行。今年，该厂工人们要在短短的几个月内安好数千吨机器设备，其中有些机件重达三、四十吨，需要把它吊到二十公尺以上的高空中进行安装。因此，该厂职工十分重视采用机械化的安装方法。远在安装准备阶段，该厂就调集了二十四公尺高的围管高车、冷型弯管机、万能剪板机及各式车床一百八十七部，工人们迅速学会了使用这些机器，大大加速了组合安装的施工准备进度。该厂自五月份开始现场安装以来，又陆续调集了各种机械。目前，只吊车一项即达十六部，其中有起重六万斤的坦克吊车、有善于升高的四十公尺塔式吊车，有轻便迅速的汽车吊车，还有苏联新式哥型吊车。
    该厂职工在实际操作中，发挥了首创精神，挖掘机械潜力。如在安装巨大的锅炉钢架时，铁道吊车和重型坦克吊车合作，采用了前吊后推、离地拖送的办法，很快就把锅炉钢架从厂外运到厂内，不仅节省了大批人工，保证了施工安全，而且提前四天完成了安装任务。现在，汽机间的桥型行车，已经在苏联专家指导下安装完毕。职工们准备用它起吊已经组合好的汽轮机和发电机，争取十一月份局部发电。
    黑龙江火力发电站第二批工程开始施工
    黑龙江火力发电站第一批土木建筑工程从去年七月初开始施工以后，现在已经进入完工阶段。第二批土木建筑工程经过长期准备，已于五月末六月初相继开始施工。
    第二批工程中的江岸水泵站，代替了一般火力发电站的冷却塔（或冷却池），直接利用自然江水，电力成本将可大大降低。这项工程的施工是极其艰巨的。从嫩江江岸到百余公尺的江心，要先修建一道弓字形的拦江坝（堰堤），拦江坝需用三千立方公尺木材和数万立方公尺土、块石，全部工程都要进行潜水作业。拦江坝建成后，把江水排除，在江底建设水泵站。
    现在，新开工的工程都以惊人的速度向前进展着。在江岸水泵站工地上，工人们操纵着强大的挖土机、推土机昼夜不停地挖土。木工们在赶制拦江坝的木笼，第一节已在水中组立安装。他们将在洪水期前完成拦江坝工程。在烟囱工程现场上，耸立着高大的铁塔，新安装的搅拌机整天转动着，在工人们辛勤劳动下，烟囱正一节节地向高空伸长起来。
    一零一厂新建炼钢场两座平炉投入生产
    一零一厂新建炼钢场继二号平炉投入生产后，第一号平炉在六月十二日也开始出钢了。
      一号平炉是在五月十八日点火烘炉的。在准备进行冶炼前，新炼钢场的职工们总结了第二号平炉开炉生产的经验教训，认真地做好了开炉前的准备工作。因此，在整个冶炼过程中，炉内情况一直很正常。
    现在，新建炼钢场已正式编制出了生产计划，新生产出的钢锭正在源源地送往轧钢车间和其他钢铁厂。钢条场已用新炼钢场的钢锭轧制出了大批的扁钢、角钢，供应武汉长江大桥和第一汽车制造厂建设的需要。钢轨场也正在加紧进行着用新炼钢场的钢锭直接轧成重钢轨的试验。试验成功以后，就可以不再需要从数千里外的鞍钢运来钢胚轧制钢轨了。
  兰新铁路古浪峡工程紧张施工
    兰新铁路修筑工程迅速西进，古浪峡工程正紧张施工。
    古浪峡是乌鞘岭西边的大门，左右两座峻峭山峰遥遥相峙，形成一个长达十公里的狭窄山峡（最窄的地方仅六十公尺）。从山峡里穿过的有甘新公路和古浪河。为了不影响公路照常通行，和按时完成铁路的修建任务，同时展开了改移公路、修建铁路的两大工程。这一工程从五月一日开始施工以来，截至六月上旬，已完成主体工程的百分之五十，铁路线土石方已完成十五万方，改移公路工程也将于六月底竣工。
    安徽造纸厂开始生产卷烟纸
    新建的国营安徽造纸厂自六月十八日起开始生产卷烟纸。十八日上午十点钟，当造纸机吐出第一尺卷烟纸的时候，工人们怀着喜悦的心情，有的把卷烟纸拿到特制的天平上去称重量，有的迎着灯光看纸里美丽的花纹。第一天生产出来的卷烟纸，经检查后质量合乎国家规定的标准。今后，这座新型的造纸工厂，将大量生产品质优良的卷烟纸，供应各地卷烟工业的需要。
    宝鸡发电厂即将动工兴建
    地方国营陕西省宝鸡发电厂修建工程将在七月间开工，预计明年第一季度完工供电。几年来，宝鸡地区各种工业和交通运输业都有很大发展，特别是宝成铁路的修建，将会给宝鸡工商业带来更大的繁荣，因此对电力的需要，也日益增长。宝鸡电厂建成发电后，宝成铁路的许多辅助机构如机务、车辆段和材料厂等，都可以从这里得到电力供应；宝鸡市一部分小型工业如榨油厂、纸烟厂、纱管厂动力用电和宝鸡城市照明用电也将得到进一步的满足；除此而外，它还将抽出一部分电力供应新秦公司各厂扩建后的需用，以解决该公司所属电厂电力供应不足的困难。
    福建南安糖厂主要厂房工程动工
    由福建省人民政府和当地爱国华侨联合投资举办的南安糖厂的主要厂房工程已于六月十八日动工兴建。中央轻工业部轻工业管理局设计工程公司，特从广东调去一百三十多名工程技术人员，到工地指导施工。晋江建筑公司五百多个职工也已进入工地。目前建筑上需要的鞍钢出品的无缝钢管、太原钢铁厂的原钢、重庆钢铁厂的轻便铁轨以及湖南出品的特型耐火砖、上海化工厂出品的铜丝板等都陆续运达现场，整套机械榨糖设备也已在广东购置。
    长白山下新筑一条森林铁路
    在东北的长白山下，从今年五月开始修建一条新的森林铁路。路基长达百余华里，从大石头贮木场伸进长白山下西南岔采伐区。铁路周围森林稠密，群山环绕，盛产各种红松、落叶松、柏松等珍贵树种。这条铁路修成后可以运输大量木材供应全国各地建设需要。
    现在两千余名职工正紧张、愉快地修筑这条铁路。他们提出要在今年国庆节前完成全部铁路修建工程。
