Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd. In the vast plains of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong, stretching thousands of miles between the Huai River and the Yellow River, the main wheat-producing areas of East China, the wheat is ripe. On the boundless fields, the wheat waves roll with the wind. State-run farms and the broad masses of farmers have already begun harvesting wheat. The wheat in this area, except for individual areas such as Tongshan and Xiao County, which have suffered from rainstorms, is generally well-filled. It is estimated that production will increase by about 20% compared to last year. The total output may exceed the bumper harvest level of 1952. It is expected that the amount of wheat produced this year, in addition to what farmers need for their own use, the amount sold and turned over to the state, as well as the amount turned over to the state by state-run farms, can provide staple food for 12 million workers for the whole year.

The wheat harvest in Heze and Jining prefectures of Shandong Province has entered a tense stage. The two state-run mechanized farms, Dongxin and Huaihai in Jiangsu Province, have overhauled eleven combine harvesters. Transport trucks, rain protection equipment, and drying ground equipment are also fully prepared. The production practice team of the East China Agricultural Mechanization School has come to Fangqiu Lake State Farm in Anhui Province to participate in the wheat harvest. The Mongolian horses newly purchased by the local state-run Suxian Prefectural Farm in Anhui Province are being harnessed to horse-drawn harvesters for wheat cutting training. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various places have uniformly allocated manpower and are harvesting according to the order of wheat maturity. The supply and marketing cooperatives in Suxian Prefecture, Anhui Province, transported 150,000 bamboo brooms from Zhejiang Province and 110,000 whetstones from Henan Province. The trucks and large horse-drawn carts of state-owned transportation companies in the center of the plain, Xuzhou, and other major cities are rushing along the plain avenues, delivering large quantities of general merchandise, fabrics, kerosene and other daily necessities from state-owned commercial departments to every market town for farmers to purchase after selling their wheat.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd. The 7,030,000 mu of winter wheat in Yuncheng Prefecture, the main wheat-producing area of Shanxi Province, began to be harvested in late May. The 250,000 mu of wheat in Yuxiang County has been completely harvested. Half of the 500,000 mu of wheat in Yongji County was harvested before May 28; it is estimated that all the wheat in the entire prefecture will be harvested by June 10.

The wheat harvest in Yuncheng Prefecture this year is generally good. The average yield per mu is 128 jin, an increase of 8 jin compared to last year. According to farmers' estimates, the average yield per mu in Yuxiang County, which has completed harvesting, has increased from 143 jin last year to 170 jin this year. The 2,327 mu of wheat in the Jin Ke Dian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yuxiang County averaged 190 jin per mu, which is 62 jin higher than the local average yield. Among them, there were ten mu of high-yield land, producing 650 jin of wheat per mu.

In April of this year, 1,500,000 mu of wheat in Yuncheng Prefecture suffered from frost to varying degrees. However, after the Shanxi Provincial People's Government allocated a large amount of fertilizer and waterwheels and other means of production and organized technical cadres to lead farmers to carry out timely watering, topdressing, and weeding to rescue the wheat seedlings, the frozen wheat seedlings quickly turned green. Before the wheat harvest, local supply and marketing cooperatives also supplied farmers with livestock and large carts, sickles and other wheat harvesting tools worth 30.9 billion yuan.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 3rd. On June 1, workers at the state-run Huangfan District Farm began harvesting wheat under the slogan of "Reducing Harvest Losses and Harvesting More Grain for the Country." Tractor drivers drive twenty-seven combine harvesters, working around the clock on more than 34,000 mu of wheat fields. On the first day of the wheat harvest competition at the Second Work Station, three of the six combine harvesters exceeded the harvesting quota. The No. 5 and No. 6 combine harvesters, towed by the "Stalin No. 18" tractor, harvested 126,500 jin of wheat in seven hours and twelve minutes, exceeding the quota by 191.47 percent, and won the red flag. The Communist Party Committee of the State-Run Huangfan District Farm conducted ideological mobilization of all employees before the start of the harvest. The wheat on the state-run Huangfan District Farm this year is the best in the three years since the farm was established. It is estimated that the yield per mu can reach 219 jin, which is more than 20% higher than last year.

    华东区及山西省主要产麦区
    广大农民紧张收割小麦
    国营黄泛区农场职工热烈展开麦收竞赛
    【新华社上海三日电】华东小麦的主要产区——淮河流域和黄河流域之间纵横千里的江苏、安徽、山东的大平原上，小麦已经成熟。一望无际的原野，麦浪随风滚滚。各个国营农场和广大农民已经开始收割小麦。这片地区的小麦，除铜山、萧县等个别地区遭受暴雨灾害外，一般结实很好。估计可比去年增产二成左右。总产量可以超过一九五二年的丰收水平。预计今年所产小麦，除农民自己需用外，出售和缴纳给国家以及国营农场上缴给国家的数量，可供一千二百万工人全年的主食之用。
    山东省的菏泽、济宁等专区麦收已进入紧张阶段。江苏省的东辛、淮海两个国营机械农场，已将十一台联合收割机检修好了。运输卡车、防雨设备和晒场用具，也都准备齐全。华东机耕学校的生产实习队已来到安徽省方邱湖国营农场，参加小麦收割。安徽省地方国营宿县专区农场新买的蒙古马，正被套上马拉收割机训练割麦。各地的农业生产合作社和互助组都统一地调配了人力，根据麦子成熟的先后进行收割。安徽省宿县专区的供销合作社远从浙江省运来了十五万把竹扫帚，从河南省运来了十一万块磨刀石。大平原的中心——徐州和其他主要城市的国营运输公司的卡车、三马大车正奔驰在平原大道上，把国营商业部门大量的百货、布匹、煤油等日用品送往每一个集镇，供农民卖出小麦后购买。
    【新华社太原三日电】山西省冬小麦主要产区运城专区的七百零三万亩小麦，已在五月下旬开始收割。虞乡县的二十五万亩小麦已全部收割完毕。永济县的五十万亩小麦已在五月二十八日前收割了一半；全专区小麦预计到六月十日即可全部收割完毕。
    今年运城专区的小麦普遍丰收。平均每亩可产一百二十八斤，比去年增产八斤。收割完毕的虞乡县，据农民估计，每亩平均收获量由去年的一百四十三斤增加到今年的一百七十斤。虞乡县晋克典农业生产合作社的二千三百二十七亩小麦，平均每亩产一百九十斤，比当地平均产量高六十二斤。其中有十亩丰产地，每亩产小麦六百五十斤。
    今年四月间，运城专区有一百五十万亩小麦遭受了不同程度的霜冻。但经山西省人民政府调拨大批肥料和水车等生产资料并组织技术干部领导农民适时进行浇水、追肥、锄草等抢救工作后，受冻的麦苗很快返青。麦收前，当地供销合作社还供应农民价值三十亿九千多万元的牲口和大车、镰刀等收麦工具。
    【新华社开封三日电】六月一日，国营黄泛区农场职工在“减免收割损失，为国家多收粮食”的口号下开始收割小麦。拖拉机手驾驶着二十七台联合收割机，在三万四千多亩麦田上日夜不停地紧张工作。第二作业站在麦收竞赛展开的第一天，六台联合收割机中就有三台超过了收割定额。由“斯大林十八号”拖拉机牵引的五号和六号两台联合收割机在七小时十二分内，收割了十二万六千五百斤小麦，超过定额百分之一百九十一点四七，夺得了红旗。中共国营黄泛区农场委员会在收割开始前，对全场职工进行了思想动员。今年国营黄泛区农场的小麦为建场三年来最好的一年，估计每亩产量可达二百一十九斤，可比去年增产二成以上。
