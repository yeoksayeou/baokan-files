Fujian Province Fruit Production Area Farmers
Efforts to Strive for a Bumper Fruit Harvest

    The Minjiang River, Jinjiang River, and Jiulong River coasts, traversing central and southern Fujian Province, are fruit-producing areas. Currently, all citrus, longan, lychee, pineapple, peach, pomelo, and other fruit trees have blossomed and borne fruit successively. Early-season loquats and waxberries are already on the market. Putian County, the largest loquat producer, is expected to produce over 5,000 dan this year. Longxi County's citrus production will increase by about 20% compared to last year, with the entire Longxi Special District projected to produce 280,000 dan, an 8% increase over last year.

    Farmers in various parts of Fujian Province have made great efforts to strive for a bumper fruit harvest and improve fruit quality. Citrus orchards and lychee orchards underwent extensive cleaning during the past winter and spring, pruning withered branches, removing overwintering pests, and accumulating a lot of fertile soil. According to statistics from Wengjian Village in Longxi, 180,000 dan of fertile soil were added to citrus trees, twice as much as last year; in Punan Township, each pomelo tree was fertilized with more than ten dan of river mud. Artificial capture and insecticide spraying were widely used to control fruit tree pests. Longxi and Minhou counties will conduct large-scale lime-sulfur mixture spraying this autumn to prevent citrus rust mites. Currently, fruit farmers in Longxi County alone have registered to purchase more than 190 sprayers and 7,000 jin of sulfur. Fruit farmers everywhere are full of confidence in striving for a bumper fruit harvest. (Yang Sizhi)

    福建省水果产区农民
    努力争取果品丰收
    横贯福建省中部和南部的闽江、晋江、九龙江沿岸是盛产水果的地区，现在，所有柑桔、龙眼、荔枝、凤梨、桃子、柚子等果树，都已相继开花结实。季节早的枇杷、杨梅已经上市，产枇杷最多的莆田县，今年可产五千担以上。龙溪县的柑桔产量将比去年增加百分之二十左右，全龙溪专区预计可产二十八万担，比去年增产百分之八。
    福建省各地农民为着争取水果丰收并提高果品质量，作了很大的努力。柑桔园荔枝园在去冬今春都进行了大清理，修剪了枯枝，除去了越冬害虫，并堆积了很多肥土。据龙溪翁建村统计，替柑桔堆了十八万担土肥，比去年增加两倍；浦南镇每株柚子树都施上了十多担河泥。对果树害虫，普遍进行了人工捕杀及药械喷射，龙溪、闽侯两县今秋将大面积进行石灰硫磺合剂喷射，防治柑桔锈壁虱，目前光龙溪一县果农就登记购买喷雾器一百九十多架，硫磺七千多斤。各地果农们正满怀信心地争取水果丰收。　　（杨思治）
