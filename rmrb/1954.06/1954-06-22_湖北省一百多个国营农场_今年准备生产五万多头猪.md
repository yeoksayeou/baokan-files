More Than 100 State-Owned Farms in Hubei Province
Plan to Produce Over 50,000 Pigs This Year

More than 100 state-owned farms in Hubei Province plan to produce more than 56,000 pigs for the state this year. The staff and workers of the farms in various places have shown great enthusiasm for raising more pigs for the country. Many farms have overfulfilled their plans. The farms in Xiangyang Prefecture were originally assigned a task of raising only 800 pigs by the state, but now they have raised more than 1,600 pigs, and are striving to raise 2,000. Many farms have used wasteland to plant crops such as vetch and alfalfa, or used wheat bran left over from their own flour mills and grinding mills as pig feed.

    湖北省一百多个国营农场
    今年准备生产五万多头猪
    湖北省一百多个国营农场，今年准备给国家生产五万六千多头毛猪。各地农场的职工对给国家增养毛猪表现了极大的热情。很多农场超额完成了计划。襄阳专区各地的农场，国家原来只分配给他们养猪八百头的任务，可是现在他们已养到一千六百多头，并且争取养两千头。很多农场利用荒地种上了苕子、苜蓿草等，或者利用农场自己的粉坊、磨坊剩余下来的麦麸等作为养猪饲料。
