Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 11th:

Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates:

On June 5th, Mr. Molotov, the Chief Representative of the Soviet delegation, put forward five proposals to enable this conference to reach a preliminary agreement on the basic principles of the Korean question. The Delegation of the People's Republic of China fully supports these proposals by Mr. Molotov. The purpose of our conference is to seek a path to a peaceful resolution of the Korean question through consultation. Now that we have a number of consistent and nearly consistent opinions, we should affirm the opinions that are already consistent and can be made consistent, and then continue to discuss the points of disagreement in order to reach a complete agreement on all issues. We believe that this is the rational path that this conference should follow in order to peacefully resolve the Korean question. We propose that this conference adopt Mr. Molotov's five proposals as the basis for further discussions.

At the same meeting, the American representative, Mr. Smith, expressed his disagreement with Mr. Molotov's proposals. He opposed the establishment of an all-Korean body to prepare for and hold free all-Korean elections, and he also opposed the establishment of an appropriate international commission to supervise the free all-Korean elections. The reasons given by the American representative are completely untenable.

In order to prepare for and hold free all-Korean elections and to promote rapprochement between North and South Korea, it is absolutely necessary to establish an all-Korean body that includes representatives from both sides, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea. This is becausethe all-Korean elections are a matter for the Korean people themselves, and no one can handle them on their behalf. At the same time, everyone knows that the peaceful reunification of Korea can only be achieved on the basis of an agreement reached through consultation between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea. Admittedly, due to the confrontation between North and South Korea, it is difficult for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to reach an agreement through consultation. However, in order to achieve the reunification of Korea by peaceful means, these difficulties cannot be avoided under any circumstances and must be overcome. Obviously, the way to overcome these difficulties is not to allow the North and South to continue to confront each other, or to impose the will of one side on the other, but to bring the two sides closer and reach an agreement through consultation. This is the only reasonable and feasible way. The purpose of establishing an all-Korean body is also to do this. The American representative attempted to oppose the all-Korean body by using the so-called "pre-arranged veto." In fact, the American representative's purpose is to try to obtain compulsory power for the Syngman Rhee group at the conference table and impose the will of one side on the other. The American representative cannot be unaware that even by means of war, the Syngman Rhee group has not been able to impose its will on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. So, what is the real intention of the American representative in opposing consultations and agreements between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea? It can only be to keep North and South Korea in continued confrontation, making it impossible to reach an agreement on a peaceful solution to the Korean question.

In order to assist the all-Korean body in supervising the free all-Korean elections, the Delegation of the People's Republic of China has proposed that an international commission composed of neutral countries be responsible for this task. Since the participating countries have all agreed to the principle of international supervision of free all-Korean elections, we believe that this principle should be affirmed first. However, the American representative insisted that the United Nations preside over the free all-Korean elections and opposed the establishment of an appropriate international commission to carry out supervision. This is clearly not prepared to solve the problem. We have repeatedly pointed out that our conference has nothing to do with the United Nations. The United Nations is a belligerent party in the Korean War. It is inconceivable that a belligerent party in the Korean War should supervise the free all-Korean elections. Mr. Spaak, head of the Belgian delegation, also said at the meeting on May 11th: "Obviously, an international organization for mediation and supervision must enjoy the equal trust of all parties concerned." Does the American representative really believe that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea would trust the United Nations, which waged a three-year war against them and brought countless disasters? This is inconceivable. Obviously, the only fair and reasonable suggestion to solve this problem is to form an international supervisory body composed of neutral countries that did not participate in the Korean War.

In order to oppose the international organization composed of neutral countries supervising the free all-Korean elections, the American representative did not hesitate to distort the facts and attack the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea at all costs. I have pointed out many times that the American representative's arguments are untenable. The contribution and achievements of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea in assisting the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement cannot be denied. In the ten months since the Korean armistice, in accordance with the provisions of the armistice agreement, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has, through unanimous resolutions, stipulated effective measures for supervising the rotation of military personnel and the replacement of war materials entering and leaving Korea, conducted regular inspections at specific rear ports throughout Korea, and carried out special investigations into incidents that violated the agreement. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has encountered difficulties in its work, but these difficulties are not due to the presence of Polish and Czechoslovakian commissioners on the committee, but due to the U.S. side's violation of the armistice agreement and repeated violations of the unanimous resolutions of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

The U.S. side violated the armistice agreement and forcibly detained more than 21,000 captured Korean and Chinese personnel after the armistice, which is a universally known fact. In order to cover up its forced detention of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, the U.S. side attempted four times to use the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to investigate the incidents of the detention of prisoners of war by the Korean and Chinese sides, which were fabricated by the U.S. side. It was natural and necessary for the Polish and Czechoslovakian commissioners of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to disagree with this demand from the U.S. side, which was necessary to safeguard the Korean Armistice Agreement. After the armistice, the U.S. side abused the provisions on rotation and replacement in the Korean Armistice Agreement and transported a large amount of war materials. This has created a series of difficulties for the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. In order to effectively supervise the implementation of the provisions on rotation and replacement in the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has unanimously agreed on a series of specific provisions, such as the provisions on reports on rotation and replacement, the provisions on random inspections at rear ports, the provisions on inspections on ships at rear seaports, the provisions on unpacking inspections, and the provisions on parts and dismantled parts of war materials, and so on. However, the U.S. side has repeatedly violated these provisions. I think it is enough to cite the documents jointly submitted by the four countries of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its groups to prove that the U.S. side violated these provisions, such as the documents of September 11, September 16, November 10, December 22, 1953, and April 27, May 19, 1954, etc. These documents fully prove that the claim that the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission was paralyzed due to the participation of Polish and Czechoslovakian commissioners is unfounded. In fact, although the U.S. side created these difficulties, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission basically completed the task of assisting the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

The U.S. side itself has constantly violated the armistice agreement and created a series of difficulties for the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. However, the American representative has instead slandered the Korean and Chinese sides for violating the armistice agreement and, regardless of the role and achievements of the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, insisted that the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission "at its best, has fundamentally no supervision at all." This is astonishing. There can be no other explanation for the American representative's upside-down statement of right and wrong than that he not only wants to prevent this conference from reaching an agreement on the issue of international supervision of the Korean free elections, but also wants to create an excuse to try to abolish the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, so that he can more freely arm Syngman Rhee's army, make the Korean armistice in a more unstable state, and threaten the peace of Korea and the security of China.

The armistice is based on the desire of both sides to cease hostilities, so the issue of supervising the armistice should not be a serious issue; in fact, international supervision of the armistice did not become a serious issue in the Korean armistice negotiations. However, in the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, international supervision has become a serious issue. The U.S. government agreed to the Neutral Nations Commission with Polish and Czechoslovakian commissioners to supervise the Korean armistice, but opposed another Neutral Nations Commission with Polish and Czechoslovakian participation to supervise the Indochina armistice.

It can be seen that the American representative's attack on the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, regardless of the facts, is ulterior motives. He not only wants to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean question, but also wants to use this to obstruct the restoration of peace in Indochina. What he is pursuing is to make the already ceased Korean armistice in a more unstable state, and to make the not-yet-ceased Indochina war not get an armistice at all.

Mr. Chairman, the American representative's arguments are unreasonable and do not conform to the facts. His attempt is against the wishes of peace-loving people of all countries. The peaceful resolution of the Korean question is so closely related to the peace and security of the Far East and the world. We have already reached many consistent or nearly consistent opinions on the discussion of the peaceful resolution of the Korean question. We have no reason to stop moving forward, and we have no reason not to continue discussing and seeking agreement based on Mr. Molotov's proposal. At the meeting on June 5th, the American representative said that, as far as his delegation was concerned, he was fully prepared to submit the points of disagreement under discussion to world public opinion. We don't know what his intention is. If his intention is to respond to the clamor of the Syngman Rhee group to withdraw from the Geneva Conference, and believes that there is no need for this conference to continue, then we cannot agree, and we believe that world public opinion will not allow it.

### 在日内瓦会议六月十一日会议上  周恩来外长关于朝鲜问题的发言

专栏：

    在日内瓦会议六月十一日会议上
    周恩来外长关于朝鲜问题的发言主席、各位代表先生：
    六月五日，苏联代表团首席代表莫洛托夫先生为使本会议对于朝鲜问题的各项基本原则能够达成初步协议，提出了五项建议。中华人民共和国代表团完全支持莫洛托夫先生的这些建议。我们这一会议的目的就是要经由协商谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的道路。我们既然已经有了不少一致和接近一致的意见，我们就应该把已经一致和可以取得一致的意见肯定下来，然后对分歧之点继续讨论以便对各项问题达成完全的协议。我们认为这是本会议为了和平解决朝鲜问题所应遵循的合理的道路。我们建议本会议采纳莫洛托夫先生的五项建议作为继续进行讨论的基础。
    美国代表史密斯先生在同一天的会上就对莫洛托夫先生的建议表示了异议。他反对成立全朝鲜的机构去筹备和举行全朝鲜的自由选举，也反对成立一个适当的国际委员会去监察全朝鲜的自由选举。美国代表所持的理由是完全站不住的。
    为了筹备和举行全朝鲜的自由选举并促成南北朝鲜的接近，成立一个包含朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国双方代表的全朝鲜机构是完全必要的。这是因为全朝鲜的选举是朝鲜人民自己的事情，谁都不能替他们办理。同时，谁都知道，只有在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国双方经由协商取得协议的基础上，朝鲜的和平统一才有可能实现。诚然，由于南北朝鲜的对立，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国双方经由协商取得协议是有一定困难的。但是，为了用和平的方法实现朝鲜的统一，这种困难不管在什么情况下都是不能避开，而且是必须克服的。很显然，克服这些困难的办法不是让南北双方继续对立下去，或者把一方的意志强加于另一方，而是使双方接近起来，并经由协商取得协议。这是唯一合理可行的办法。成立全朝鲜机构的目的也就在此。美国代表企图用所谓“预先安置的否决权”的说法来反对全朝鲜的机构。其实，美国代表的目的是企图在会议桌上为李承晚集团取得强制权，把一方的意志强加于另一方。美国代表不能不知道，就是用战争的办法，李承晚集团也没有能够将他们的意志强加于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。那么，美国代表反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国双方进行协商取得协议的真正用意究竟是什么呢？那只能是使南北朝鲜继续对立下去，使和平解决朝鲜问题不可能达成协议。
    为了协助全朝鲜机构对全朝鲜的自由选举进行监察，中华人民共和国代表团已经建议由中立国家组成国际委员会担负这一任务。既然与会各国都同意国际监察全朝鲜自由选举的原则，我们认为这一原则应该首先肯定下来。但是，美国代表坚持由联合国主持全朝鲜的自由选举，反对成立适当的国际委员会来进行监察。这显然是不准备解决问题的。我们已经多次指出，我们这一会议和联合国毫无关系。联合国是朝鲜战争中的交战一方，不可能设想由朝鲜战争中的交战一方来对全朝鲜的自由选举进行监察。比利时代表团团长斯巴克先生在五月十一日的会上也曾说过：“显然，一个进行调解和监察的国际组织必须享有一切有关方面同等的信任。”难道美国代表真正相信朝鲜民主主义人民共和国会对于向他们进行了三年战争并带来了无数灾难的联合国给予信任么？这是不可设想的。很显然，由未参加朝鲜战争的中立国家组成国际监察机构是解决这个问题的唯一公平合理的建议。
    为了反对由中立国家组成国际机构监察全朝鲜的自由选举，美国代表不惜歪曲事实，不顾一切地攻击朝鲜中立国监察委员会。我已经多次指出过，美国代表的论据是站不住的。朝鲜中立国监察委员会对于协助实施朝鲜停战协定的贡献和成绩是不容抹煞的。朝鲜停战十个月以来，中立国监察委员会按照停战协定的规定，经过一致决议，规定了监察进出朝鲜的军事人员的轮换和作战物资的替换的有效办法，在朝鲜全境的特定后方口岸进行了经常的视察，并对违反协定的事件进行了特别调查。中立国监察委员会在它的工作中是有困难的，但这些困难不是由于委员会中有了波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的委员，而是由于美方违反停战协定并多次违反中立国监察委员会的一致决议而造成的。
    美方违反停战协定，在停战后强迫扣留了二万一千余名朝中被俘人员，这是举世皆知的事实。美方为了掩盖它强迫扣留朝中战俘的行为，曾经四次企图利用中立国监察委员会到朝中方面调查美方所捏造的朝中方面扣留战俘的事件。中立国监察委员会的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员不能同意美方的这种要求是当然的，是维护朝鲜停战协定所必需的。美方在停战之后滥用朝鲜停战协定中关于轮换和替换的规定，运进了大量的作战物资。这就为中立国监察委员会造成了一系列的困难。为了有效地监察朝鲜停战协定中关于轮换和替换的规定的实施，中立国监察委员会曾经一致协议了一系列的具体规定，例如关于轮换和替换的报告的规定、关于在后方口岸进行抽查的规定、关于在后方海运口岸上船视察的规定、关于开箱检查的规定、关于作战物资的零件和拆散件的规定等等。但是，美方却屡次违反了这些规定。我想只要举出中立国监察委员会和它的小组中波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞典、瑞士四国一致提出的证明美方违反这些规定的文件就够了，例如一九五三年九月十一日、九月十六日、十一月十日、十二月二十二日、一九五四年四月二十七日、五月十九日等等的文件。这些文件充分证明了所谓朝鲜中立国监察委员会由于有波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员的参加而陷于瘫痪的说法是没有根据的。事实上，虽然美方制造了这些困难，中立国监察委员会还是基本上完成了协助实施朝鲜停战协定的任务的。
    美方自己不断违反停战协定，替中立国监察委员会制造了一系列的困难。但是，美国代表反而诬蔑朝中方面违反停战协定，并不顾朝鲜中立国监察委员会的作用和功绩，硬说朝鲜中立国监察委员会“从它最好的方面来说也只是根本没有任何监察”。这是令人惊讶的。美国代表这种颠倒是非的说法，不可能有旁的解释，只能被解释为，他不仅要阻挠本会议对国际监察朝鲜自由选举的问题达成协议，而且还要制造借口，企图取消朝鲜中立国监察委员会，好更自由地武装李承晚的军队，使朝鲜停战处于更不稳定的状态，来威胁朝鲜的和平和中国的安全。
    停战是建立在交战双方都具有停战的愿望的基础上的，因此监察停战的问题不应该成为严重的问题；在朝鲜停战谈判中对于停战的国际监察，事实上也没有变成过严重的问题。但是，在恢复印度支那和平的问题上，国际监察却变成了严重的问题。美国政府同意了有波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员参加的中立国委员会监察朝鲜停战，但是却反对有波兰和捷克斯洛伐克参加的另一个中立国委员会去监察印度支那的停战。
    由此可见，美国代表不顾事实地攻击朝鲜中立国监察委员会是别有用心的。他不仅要阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，而且还要借此阻挠印度支那和平的恢复。他所追求的目的是要使已经停战的朝鲜处于更加不稳定的状态之中，是要使尚未停战的印度支那根本得不到停战。
    主席先生，美国代表的这些论点是没有道理的，是不符合事实的。他的企图是违反爱好和平的各国人民的愿望的。和平解决朝鲜问题是这样密切地关系着远东和世界的和平和安全。我们对于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论，已经取得了不少一致或接近一致的意见。我们没有任何理由停止前进，我们没有理由不根据莫洛托夫先生的建议，继续讨论，寻求协议。在六月五日的会上，美国代表说，就他的代表团而论，他已充分准备将讨论中的分歧之点诉诸世界舆论。我们不知道他的用意何在。如果他的用意是在于响应李承晚集团关于退出日内瓦会议的叫嚣，认为本会议已没有继续进行的必要，那是我们不能同意的，我们相信，也是世界舆论所不容许的。　（新华社日内瓦十一日电）
