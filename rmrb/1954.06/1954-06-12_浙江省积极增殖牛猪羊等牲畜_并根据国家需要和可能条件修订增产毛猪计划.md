    Zhejiang Province is increasing the number of cattle, pigs, and sheep by 800,000 this year, an increase of more than 15% compared to last year. After this task is completed, it is estimated that more than 200 million dan of manure can be accumulated, which can be used to fertilize about one-third of the province's arable land.

    Zhejiang Province has excellent livestock populations in various places, many types of feed, and abundant yields. It also has more than 70 million mu of barren mountains that can be used for grazing, with great potential for breeding livestock. This year, various places will mainly rely on mutual aid and cooperation organizations to develop animal husbandry production, because mutual aid and cooperation organizations have more advantages in allocating labor and increasing feed production than individual farmers. In order to improve livestock breeds and improve livestock quality, the province's ten state-owned livestock breeding stations will vigorously carry out breeding work for cattle and pigs. State-owned farms in various places will also gradually establish breeding points to breed livestock for farmers. At the same time, various places will strengthen the leadership of private livestock breeding households. Each of the province's more than 2,000 agricultural production cooperatives will train a livestock technician to carry out mass livestock increase campaigns and promote scientific feeding and management methods.

    According to national needs and local possibilities, Zhejiang Province has increased the original plan to raise more than 3.3 million pigs to 4 million pigs. To ensure the realization of this plan, Party and government leading organs at all levels in Zhejiang Province will further strengthen their leadership over farmers' pig production and help farmers to open up more sources of feed. The state-owned Jinhua Pig Farm and state-owned farms will supply farmers with a large number of Yorkshire and Berkshire improved breeding pigs, and will expand the supply of hybrid pigs. The province's animal husbandry and veterinary staff will carry out preventive injections of swine erysipelas and hog cholera for farmers' pigs, which will also be increased from the original plan of more than 330,000 to more than 580,000.

    浙江省积极增殖牛猪羊等牲畜
    并根据国家需要和可能条件修订增产毛猪计划
    浙江省今年增殖牛、猪、羊八十万头，比去年增加百分之十五强。这个任务完成后，估计可积厩肥二亿担以上，约可供全省三分之一的耕地施用。
    浙江省各地都有优良的畜群，饲料种类很多，产量也很丰富，并有可作放牧的荒山七千多万亩，繁殖牲畜的潜在力很大。今年各地将主要依靠互助合作组织来发展畜牧业生产，因为互助合作组织在调配劳动力增产饲料方面比单干农民有较多的优越条件。为改进牲畜品种，提高牲畜质量，全省十个国营牲畜配种站将大力开展耕牛和猪的配种工作，各地国营农场也将逐步建立配种点，给农民的牲畜配种，同时各地将加强对民营牲畜配种户的领导。全省二千多个农业生产合作社，每社都将培养一个畜牧技术人员，以便开展群众性的增畜运动和推行科学饲养管理方法。　　　（新华社）
    浙江省根据国家需要和当地可能，把原计划全省养猪三百三十多万只增加到四百万只。为保证这个计划的实现，浙江省各级党政领导机关将进一步加强对农民养猪生产的领导，帮助农民多方面开辟饲料来源。国营金华猪场和各国营农场将供应农民大批约克夏、巴克夏优良种猪，并将扩大供应杂交猪。全省畜牧兽医工作人员给农民的猪进行猪丹毒和猪瘟病的预防注射，也将由原计划三十三万多只增加到五十八万多只。　　　（新华社）
