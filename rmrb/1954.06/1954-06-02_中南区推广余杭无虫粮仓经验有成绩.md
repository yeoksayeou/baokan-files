The grain departments in the Central South region are actively learning from Zhejiang Province's Yu Hang County's experience in storing grain in insect-free granaries and are experimenting with building such granaries. As of mid-May, Guangxi Province has identified sixteen granaries as key points for promoting Yu Hang County's experience; Henan Province has launched key experiments in nine hundred and nine granaries; Jiangxi Province plans to make 10% of its granaries insect-free this year, and also plans to create a number of mold-free and rat-free granaries; Hubei Province plans to make 5% of its granaries insect-free and mold-free this year, and 10% insect-free, as well as creating a number of mold-free granaries; and each special district in Hunan Province is preparing to trial one or two insect-free granaries.

In the process of promoting Yu Hang County's insect-free granary experience, grain depots in the Central South region have actively carried out warehouse cleaning and sanitation work in conjunction with grain quality surveys. In Changsha County, Hunan Province, the grain depots in the ?Li and Huanghua districts cleared more than sixty dan of garbage and stones and more than thirty thousand jin of ash in one month. Grain storage personnel in these two districts, such as Wen Guangzhong and Cheng Ziliang, climbed into the bottom of the granaries to sweep, and they also studied and improved the efficiency of cleaning and sanitation work. The No. 1 Grain Depot in Jinxian County, Jiangxi Province, was a warehouse established in the fifth year of the Guangxu reign (Qing Dynasty), and had never been properly cleaned in the past. In the process of promoting Yu Hang County's experience this time, the grain depot staff thoroughly swept the warehouse and removed all weeds within three meters of the warehouse, and filled in all the depressions. According to statistics from the grain depots in Huangpi, Macheng, Jianli, Zhijiang, Enshi and other counties in Hubei Province, which are experimenting with building insect-free granaries, a total of more than 786,000 jin of weeds, dust, insect corpses, etc. were removed from inside and outside the granaries, and the disinfection area reached more than 140,000 square chi. All of this has provided an important guarantee for reducing grain losses.

In order to consolidate the achievements already made in learning from Yu Hang County's experience, grain departments in the Central South region are currently establishing and improving cleaning and sanitation systems. (Lu Shumin Ma Zhong)

    中南区推广余杭无虫粮仓经验有成绩
    中南各地粮食部门正积极学习浙江省余杭县无虫粮仓保管粮食的经验，试建无虫粮仓。截至五月中旬，广西省已确定以十六个粮库作为推行余杭县经验的重点；河南省已在九百零九座粮仓展开重点试验；江西省计划在今年使百分之十的粮仓成为无虫粮仓，另外还计划创造一批无霉粮仓和无鼠粮仓；湖北省计划在今年使百分之五的粮仓成为无虫、无霉粮仓，使百分之十的粮仓成为无虫粮仓，另外还要创造一批无霉粮仓；湖南省各专区都准备试建一两处无虫粮仓。
    在推广余杭县无虫粮仓经验的过程中，中南各地粮库结合粮质普查，积极进行了仓库清洁卫生等工作。湖南省长沙县的?梨、黄花两个区的粮库，在一个月内就清除垃圾、石块六十多担，灰屑三万余斤。这两个区的粮食保管人员，如文光中、程子良等都爬进仓底进行扫除，他们还研究提高了清洁卫生工作的效率。江西省进贤县第一粮库是清光绪五年建立的仓库，过去从来没有很好地打扫过，在这次推广余杭县经验的过程中，粮库工作人员在仓房内彻底进行了扫除，并把仓房外面三公尺以内的杂草全部铲除，把凹地全都填平。湖北省据黄陂、麻城、监利、枝江、恩施等县试建无虫粮仓各粮库的统计，共清除仓房内外的杂草、灰尘、虫尸等七十八万六千余斤，消毒面积达十四万余平方市尺。这都为减少粮食损失提供了重要保证。
    为了巩固在学习余杭县经验中已有的成绩，目前，中南各地粮食部门正在建立和健全清洁卫生等制度。（卢树敏　马忠）
