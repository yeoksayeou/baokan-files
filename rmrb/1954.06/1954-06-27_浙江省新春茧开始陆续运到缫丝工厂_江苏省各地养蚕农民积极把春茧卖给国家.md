    Zhejiang Province's New Spring Cocoons Begin to Be Transported to Silk Reeling Factories
    Jiangsu Province's Silkworm Farmers Actively Sell Spring Cocoons to the State

    Zhejiang Province's spring cocoons have begun to be successively transported to silk reeling factories. By the beginning of June, the province's silkworm farmers had sold more than 200,000 dan of spring cocoons to the state. The 2,400 cocoon-drying stoves distributed in the cocoon-producing areas have successively begun their intense cocoon-drying work. Batches of dried cocoons are being transported by a large number of trucks, ships, wooden boats, and trains to silk reeling factories and cocoon storage warehouses throughout the province. The six newly built steel and concrete warehouses and the existing warehouses have been prepared with cleaning, disinfection, and sealing, ensuring the safe storage of new cocoons after they enter the warehouse. Some silk reeling factories in Hangzhou have test-reeled the first batch of new cocoons, and some have begun production using the new cocoons. In addition, Zhejiang Province will also transport a large number of dried cocoons to Shanghai and other places.

    The supply and marketing cooperatives in the cocoon-producing areas of Jiangsu Province, entrusted by the state, universally launched the work of purchasing spring cocoons on June 1st. According to incomplete statistics, by June 11th, more than 149,500 dan of improved silkworm seed spring cocoons had been purchased.
    Silkworm cocoon production is an important sideline in Jiangsu's rural areas, distributed in 44 counties and cities throughout the province. The income from silkworm rearing of silkworm farmers in the main cocoon-producing areas on both sides of Taihu Lake accounts for about 40 percent of the total agricultural and sideline income each year. According to statistics, the total value of silkworm cocoons sold by Jiangsu's silkworm farmers to the state in the past four years is about 600 billion yuan. This year's total spring cocoon production in Jiangsu Province is about 10 percent more than in 1952. The average cocoon production per silkworm seed is about 50 jin or more, and the highest cocoon production per silkworm seed in Bashi District, Wuxi County, reached 70 jin.
    Before purchasing cocoons, the supply and marketing cooperatives in the cocoon-producing areas set up 287 cocoon receiving stations, making it very convenient for farmers to sell spring cocoons; at the same time, they trained 2,254 cocoon grading staff to ensure the implementation of the state's price policy. Silkworm farmers are actively selling cocoons to the state. The spring cocoons already sold by silkworm farmers in Wuxi County alone are worth more than 43 billion yuan. (Zhang Zeshan)

    浙江省新春茧开始陆续运到缫丝工厂
    江苏省各地养蚕农民积极把春茧卖给国家
    浙江省今年的春茧已开始陆续运到各缫丝工厂。到六月初旬，全省蚕农卖给国家的春茧即有二十多万担。分布在各产茧区的二千四百多座烘茧灶，都已先后展开紧张的烘茧工作。一批批烘好的干茧，正陆续用大批汽车、轮船、木船和火车，运到该省各地缫丝工厂和存蚕茧的仓库。新建的六座钢骨水泥仓库和原有的仓库，已经作好清洁、消毒和密闭等准备工作，使新茧入仓以后能安全贮藏。杭州市的部分缫丝工厂将第一批新茧进行了试缫，有的已开始用新茧生产。另外，浙江省还将把大批干茧运往上海等地。

    江苏省蚕茧产区的供销合作社接受国家委托，自六月一日起普遍展开收购春茧的工作。据不完全统计，到六月十一日，已收购改良蚕种春茧十四万九千五百多担。
    蚕茧生产是江苏农村的重要副业，分布在全省四十四个县、市。太湖两岸主要产茧区的蚕农每年养蚕的收入，占到整个农副业收入的百分之四十上下。据统计，江苏省蚕农四年来卖给国家的蚕茧，总值约六千亿元。今年江苏省春茧总产量约比一九五二年增加一成多。每张蚕种平均产茧量约在五十斤以上，无锡县八士区每张蚕种产茧量最高达七十斤。
    在收购蚕茧以前，产茧区供销合作社设立了二百八十七个收茧站，使农民出售春茧很感方便；同时训练了二千二百五十四名评茧等工作人员，保证了国家价格政策的贯彻。蚕农们都积极把蚕茧卖给国家。仅无锡县蚕农已经卖出的春茧，即值四百三十余亿元。　（张泽山）
