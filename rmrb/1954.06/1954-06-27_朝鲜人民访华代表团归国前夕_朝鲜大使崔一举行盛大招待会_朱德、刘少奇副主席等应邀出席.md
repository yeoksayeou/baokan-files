Xinhua News Agency, June 26th: On the occasion of the visit of the Korean People's Delegation to China, Choi Il, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, held a grand reception on the evening of the 26th.

All members of the Korean People's Delegation to China, headed by Chairman Kim Ung-gi, and those in charge of the art troupe attended the reception.

Invited to the reception were: Zhu De and Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairmen of the Central People's Government; Deng Xiaoping, Vice Premier of the State Council; Zhang Zongxun, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission; Xiao Hua and Gan Siqi, Deputy Directors of the General Political Department; Zhang Hanfu, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs; and the responsible persons and representatives of the commissions, ministries, bureaus, institutes, departments, and administrations under the State Council.

Also invited to the reception were: Shen Junru, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea; Dong Biwu, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; standing committee members, and members in Beijing of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the China Peace Committee; responsible persons and representatives of various democratic parties and people's organizations.

Also invited to the reception were: Peng Zhen, Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government; responsible persons of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress Consultative Committee, the North China Branch of the Resist America and Aid Korea Association, and the Beijing Branch of the Resist America and Aid Korea Association; model workers; representatives of revolutionary martyrs' families and military families; and people from the capital's cultural circles.

Also invited to the reception were: diplomatic envoys to China from the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries.

More than 600 people attended the reception.

After the reception began, Choi Il, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, spoke first. After narrating the long history of the deep friendship between the people of Korea and China, he said: During their visit of more than three months, the Korean People's Delegation to China received warm and active assistance from the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, and all the Chinese people, and successfully completed the glorious mission entrusted to them by the Korean people. I believe that the completion of this glorious task by the Korean People's Delegation to China will undoubtedly further consolidate the friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China forged in blood, and will further encourage the Korean people to struggle for the recovery and construction of the post-war national economy.

Kim Ung-gi, head of the Korean People's Delegation to China, then spoke. He said: This visit to China has made us more deeply aware that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, unanimously hope that the Korean people can achieve more brilliant victories and create a better and happier life. After we return home, we will convey everything we have seen in detail to the Korean people to encourage their fighting enthusiasm and make unremitting efforts to further promote the friendship and unity of the two peoples.

Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government, then spoke. He said: The Chinese people are deeply concerned about the achievements of the Korean people in all aspects. The heroic spirit shown by the Korean people in the great struggle against the American imperialist aggressors and the selfless labor spirit they have displayed in the cause of recovery and development of the post-war people's economy have always been respected by the Chinese people. The Chinese people have always regarded every achievement and every victory of the Korean people as an important guarantee for the victorious construction of their own motherland. Now, through the hard work of the Korean People's Delegation to China, the Chinese people have further recognized the great and staunch national character and the long-standing and excellent cultural traditions of the Korean people. All this will have a far-reaching impact on the people of China and Korea, thereby further consolidating and developing the traditional fighting friendship between the two peoples.

Liu Shaoqi said: The correct propositions and unremitting efforts of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the Geneva Conference on the peaceful settlement of the Korean question are fully supported and endorsed by the people of China and the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people in the world. However, due to the utmost sabotage by the US authorities, the discussion on the peaceful settlement of the Korean question at the Geneva Conference was forced to end. This fact further exposed the criminal conspiracy of the United States to undermine peace, and the people of China and Korea must maintain high vigilance to prevent the United States from launching a war of aggression again. The Chinese people are deeply convinced that under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, and with the assistance of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the cause of the Korean people to defend world peace and to strive for a peaceful reunification, independence, and democratic Korea will continue to achieve new and greater victories.

During the meeting, the hosts and guests repeatedly toasted to the growing strength of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and Korea, to the achievements of the Korean people in striving for peaceful reunification, independence, and democracy, and in the cause of restoring the national economy, and to the health of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the respected leader of the Korean people, Marshal Kim Il-sung.

The reception proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere.

At the reception, artists from Korea and China performed wonderful programs, which were warmly welcomed. Finally, a dance party was held.

  一光荣任务的完成，无疑地会进一步巩固朝中两国人民以鲜血结成的友谊团结，并将更加鼓舞朝鲜人民为恢复建设战后国民经济而进行的斗争。
    朝鲜人民访华代表团团长金应基接着讲话。他说：这次访问中国，使我们更深刻地认识到在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下的中国人民，都一致希望朝鲜人民能够获得更灿烂辉煌的胜利和创造更美好的幸福生活。我们回国以后，将把我们所见到的一切详细地传达给朝鲜人民，以此来鼓舞他们的斗争热情，并为进一步促进两国人民的友谊团结而作不懈的努力。
