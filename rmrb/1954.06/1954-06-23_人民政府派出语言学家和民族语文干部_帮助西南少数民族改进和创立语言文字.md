    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, June 22nd: In order to help the southwestern ethnic minorities develop their languages, the People's Government has continuously sent linguists and ethnic language cadres to various regions to assist the minorities in sorting out, improving, and creating ethnic scripts. The Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Department of Linguistics of the Central University for Nationalities, and other institutions have successively dispatched specialists to work in various locations. The Southwestern, Yunnan, and Guizhou Nationalities Institutes have also conducted research on several ethnic languages and scripts.

    Over the past few years, the People's Government has helped the Yi people in Xikang formulate a new script, initially improved the Dai script in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region in Yunnan, drafted a plan to reform the Lahu script in Yunnan and a plan to create a Buyi script in Guizhou, collected Kawa vocabulary, and understood the distribution of Yi dialects in Yunnan, Miao dialects in Southwest China, and other ethnic dialects. It has also compiled textbooks in the Naxi and Miao languages, among others, for practice. These measures have laid a good foundation for improving and creating ethnic scripts, and have been welcomed and assisted by the local people of all ethnic groups. The new Yi script in Xikang has achieved preliminary results in the past few years of practice. Currently, a complete set of elementary school textbooks has been compiled using the new Yi script, and newspapers and more than 20 other kinds of publications have been published. Thirty-eight elementary schools in the Xichang Special District and the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture have adopted textbooks using this script. More than 6,000 Yi people now recognize this script. Among the ethnic minority languages, in addition to Tibetan and Dai, which are used by the autonomous region's people's government in official documents, Tibetan, Dai, the new Yi script, Jingpo, and Lisu are used in cultural publishing. In 1953, the Southwest Region sent a total of 542,800 copies of policy documents, books, pictorials, comic books, and other materials in both Chinese and these ethnic languages to various ethnic minority areas.

    In March of this year, the Central University for Nationalities organized an ethnic language practice team to conduct language surveys and research on ethnic minorities in the Southwest. They are divided into language groups including Dai, Jingpo, Kawa, Lisu, Naxi, Miao, and Buyi. They are currently working in the Xishuangbanna region, Dehong region, Nujiang region, Lancang region in Yunnan, and the Miao mountain area and Panjiang River basin in Guizhou.

    人民政府派出语言学家和民族语文干部
    帮助西南少数民族改进和创立语言文字
    【新华社重庆二十二日电】人民政府为帮助西南各少数民族发展语言文字，曾不断派出语言学家、民族语文干部等到各地帮助少数民族进行整理、改进和创立民族文字的工作。中国科学院语言研究所、中央民族学院语文系等都先后派专人到各地工作。西南、云南、贵州等民族学院也进行了几种民族语言文字的研究工作。
    几年来人民政府已帮助西康彝族制订了新文字，初步改进了云南德宏傣族景颇族自治区的傣文，拟定了改革云南拉祜文方案和创立贵州布依文的方案，搜集了佧瓦语词汇，了解了云南彝语、西南苗语和其他民族方言分布情况；并编辑了纳西语、苗语等民族语的课本，进行实习。以上这些措施，给改进和创立民族文字，作了良好准备工作，受到当地各族人民的欢迎和帮助。西康新彝文在过去几年的实践中，已收到初步效果。目前用新彝文编辑了全套小学课本，出版了报纸和二十多种其他读物。西昌专区和凉山彝族自治区有三十八所小学就采用了这种文字的课本。认识这种文字的彝人已有六千多人。少数民族文字中除藏文和傣文为自治区人民政府在公文中使用外，用于文化出版事业上的有藏文、傣文、新彝文、景颇文、傈僳文等民族文字。一九五三年西南区发往各民族地区的汉文和这些民族文字对照的政策文件、书刊、画报、连环画等共五十四万二千八百多份。
    今年三月，中央民族学院组织了民族语文实习队，到西南进行少数民族的语言调查研究工作。他们共分傣语、景颇语、佧瓦语、傈僳语、纳西语、苗语、布依语等语文组。现在正分别在云南西双版纳地区、德宏地区、怒江地区、澜沧地区和贵州的苗岭山区、盘江流域一带进行工作。
