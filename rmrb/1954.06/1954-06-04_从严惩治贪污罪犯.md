Since the "Three-Anti" Movement in 1952 severely punished and struck a blow against the crimes of corruption and theft of state property, such crimes have greatly decreased, but they have not completely disappeared. The case of Du Weisong, head (i.e., mine manager) of the Hunan Local State-Owned Shaoyang Niumasi Coal Mine Engineering Office and secretary of the CCP Shaoyang Niumasi Coal Mine Branch, published today (see page 3), is one example of many new corruption and theft cases that have occurred since the "Three-Anti" Movement.

　　Du Weisong was cultivated and educated by the Party and held the responsibility of Party and government leadership in the Niumasi Coal Mine, but he did not consciously transform himself. During the "Three-Anti" Movement, he refused to confess his previous acts of corruption. After the "Three-Anti" Movement, when the people of the whole country were rejoicing and working hard for the country's large-scale economic construction and socialist future, he continued to use his power and position to systematically steal state property and the fruits of the labor of the people for his own enjoyment. He even embezzled the money decided by the Party branch and the trade union to buy waterproof rubber shoes for the miners working underground. He specialized in seeking out cadres with bad character, using various conspiracies and tricks to drag people into the water, and then promoted them without authorization for his own use. He tried his best to collude with unscrupulous merchants, instructing them to forge receipts, falsely report and overclaim, and even go so far as to rush to buy grain for them. In short, he had degenerated into a criminal who stole state property.

　　Some people may think that such incidents are only isolated and accidental after the "Three-Anti" Movement. This is not the case. Taking Harbin as an example, according to the investigation report of the Municipal People's Government People's Supervision Committee at the end of last year, new corruption incidents were found in 50 of the 70 financial and economic enterprises, basic construction, political and legal, and cultural and educational work units surveyed, involving a total of 375.4 million yuan in embezzled public funds and materials. There were twelve people who embezzled 5 million yuan or even more than 10 million yuan. There was also a major corrupt official not included in the statistics who embezzled nearly 300 million yuan alone. About half of these corrupt officials had started working before the "Three-Anti" Movement and had received "Three-Anti" education. Among these corrupt officials, about 20 percent had been corrupt before the "Three-Anti" Movement and had re-offended after the "Three-Anti" Movement.

　　These facts tell us that the phenomenon of corruption and theft of state property cannot be eradicated by one vigorous movement. With the progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation, it is not surprising that some unfaithful and unstable elements in the revolutionary ranks degenerate and embark on the criminal path of corruption and theft of state property. Therefore, the struggle against corruption and theft will be a long-term struggle. If we are overwhelmed by the victories of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, fail to see the situation of this long-term struggle, abandon the necessary vigilance and precautions, and do not take the necessary steps to prevent and overcome the phenomenon of corruption and theft, this phenomenon will certainly develop and spread, causing serious damage to the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation. Then, what measures should we take to eliminate corruption?

　　First, it is necessary to constantly and continuously conduct in-depth patriotic education and class education for the staff of the Party and the state, improve the political quality, class consciousness, and socialist enthusiasm of the staff, and cultivate and stimulate a strong aversion to individualistic thinking and corrupt and degenerate life. Many regions and units have abandoned or relaxed this work of education and mobilization after the "Three-Anti" Movement, so evil forces are growing secretly again. Only by making this work of education and mobilization regular and maintaining the enthusiasm of the masses can we overwhelm and eliminate evil forces.

　　Second, for those corrupt and thieving elements who have already been discovered, we must resolutely implement the principle of "severe punishment from now on" and implement severe punishment. The period of "leniency in the past" has long passed; after the "Three-Anti" Movement, it should be "severe." The lenient treatment of many cases during the "Three-Anti" Movement was to cure diseases and save people, and to save those who were willing to accept salvation and were determined to completely transform themselves. If some people regard this policy as a loophole that can be exploited and continue to engage in corruption and theft, it proves that they have no intention of accepting transformation and are beyond redemption. For such elements, we must never indefinitely invoke the policy of curing diseases and saving people, but must implement strict legal sanctions. This kind of legal sanction should be regarded as a means of educating the general cadres and the people. For those corruption and theft cases that are more typical, public trials should be conducted, sentences should be pronounced in public, and necessary reports and discussions should be organized to raise awareness and learn lessons. At the same time, cadres and the masses should be called upon to report all corrupt and thieving elements anytime and anywhere. Everyone should be told that actively fighting against corrupt and thieving elements is a glorious and courageous revolutionary action, and an important contribution to the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, so everyone should not be afraid of difficulties and should confidently rise up to continue to fight against corrupt and thieving elements. The leading organs should seriously and conscientiously handle the reports and accusations of the people and cadres and give them full support.

　　Third, in all state organs and enterprises, criticism and self-criticism must be carried out constantly and continuously, various bureaucratic phenomena must be checked and exposed, and all loopholes that can be exploited by corrupt and thieving elements must be eliminated. Some organs allow an accountant to control both cash accounts and seals, and also act as purchasing agent, without anyone checking his work; some construction sites allow an accountant to manage work tickets and also calculate work hours, and do not check when discrepancies are found between financial accounts and material accounts; some trade companies only manage to allocate payments to purchasing stations in other places, without checking how much has actually been used and how much is left; some factory directors pre-stamp blank checks for costs and leave them there. These obvious loopholes that can be seen at a glance must be plugged immediately. We must never allow these loopholes to continue to exist for the use of thieves under the pretext of "the system needs long-term construction" and "the work needs to move forward steadily." In terms of personnel, strict systems and principles must be observed, and it is absolutely not allowed to irresponsibly put corrupt elements who have just been dealt with in the "Three-Anti" Movement back into important positions where they handle a large amount of money without any test. Even if they have been "sincerely" remorseful, or have considerable business talent, we must never gamble with state property. For ordinary cadres who come into contact with money and materials, their work and accounts must be checked regularly, and necessary ideological and work style checks must be carried out at any time. The phenomenon of not conducting inspections unless there is a major problem must be corrected. For regions and units where corruption is serious, the responsibility of leading cadres who have committed bureaucratic mistakes must also be investigated.

　　In order to improve and tighten the financial system, effectively prevent and timely detect corruption and theft, and check and correct various bureaucratic phenomena, the work of the people's supervisory organs must be greatly strengthened. Experience has proven that wherever the supervision work is carried out well, corruption, theft, and bureaucratic phenomena can be detected more timely. The supervisory organs play a significant role in preventing and detecting corrupt and thieving elements by exercising daily supervision and inspection of the production and financial activities of enterprises. Therefore, it is very important to strengthen the work of the people's supervision.

### 从严惩治贪污罪犯

    从严惩治贪污罪犯
    自从一九五二年“三反”运动给了贪污盗窃国家财产的罪行以严重的惩罚和打击之后，这种罪行已经大大地减少了，但是，并没有完全绝迹。今天发表的湖南地方国营邵阳牛马司煤矿工程处长（即矿长）兼中共邵阳牛马司煤矿支部书记杜维松的贪污盗窃事件（见第三版），就是“三反”以后新发生的许多贪污盗窃事件中的
  一例。
    杜维松受过党的培养和教育，担负着牛马司煤矿的党政领导责任，但他并没有自觉地改造自己，
  “三反”中，他拒不交代自己以前的贪污罪行。
  “三反”以后，全国人民都在为国家的大规模经济建设和社会主义前途而欢欣鼓舞和辛勤劳动，他却在继续利用职权和地位，有计划地偷窃国家的财产和人民群众的劳动果实，供自己享用。他甚至把党支部和工会决定给下井工人买一双防水胶鞋的钱都贪污了。他专门在干部中物色品质恶劣的分子，用各种阴谋诡计拖人下水，然后擅自加以提升，供自己利用。他极力和奸商勾结，指使奸商假造领据，虚报浮领，甚至不惜为奸商抢购粮食。总之，他已经堕落成为盗窃国家财产的罪人。
    有的人也许以为这类事件在“三反”以后只是个别的和偶然的了。事实不是这样。以哈尔滨市为例，根据市人民政府人民监察委员会去年年底的调查报告，在被调查的七十个财经企业、基本建设、政法、文教工作单位中，竟有五十个单位发现了新的贪污事件，贪污公款公物共三亿七千五百四十万元。贪污到五百万元以至一千万元以上的，有十二人。另有一个未统计在内的大贪污犯，一人贪污近三亿元。这些贪污犯有一半是“三反”以前参加工作，受过“三反”教育的。在这些贪污犯中约有百分之二十是“三反”以前就贪污过，而在“三反”以后又重犯的。
    这些事实告诉我们：贪污盗窃国家财产的现象，是不可能经过一次轰轰烈烈的运动就根绝了的。随着社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的进展，革命队伍中的一部分不忠实不坚定的分子，蜕化变质，走上贪污盗窃国家财产的罪恶道路，是并不奇怪的。因此，反对贪污盗窃的斗争，将是长期性的斗争。如果我们因为“三反”、“五反”的胜利而冲昏头脑，看不见这种长期斗争的形势，放弃了必要的警惕和戒备，不采取必要的步骤来防止和克服贪污盗窃的现象，这种现象就一定会发展蔓延，给国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业带来严重的损害。那末，我们应该采取什么办法来肃清贪污现象呢？
    第一、必须经常不断地对党和国家的工作人员进行深入的爱国主义的教育和阶级教育，提高工作人员的政治品质、阶级觉悟和社会主义热情，培养和激发工作人员对于个人主义思想和腐化堕落生活的强烈憎厌情绪。“三反”以后许多地区和单位放弃或放松了这种教育和鼓动的工作，所以邪气又在暗暗滋长。只有使这种教育和鼓动工作经常化，经常保持群众的热情，才能压倒和消灭邪气。
    第二、对于已经发现的贪污盗窃分子，必须坚决贯彻“今后从严”的原则，实行严惩。“过去从宽”的时期，早已过去；“三反”以后，就应该
  “从严”了。“三反”期间对许多案件从宽处理，是为了治病救人，挽救那些愿意接受挽救、决心彻底改造自己的人。如果有人把这种政策看作一种可以利用的空隙，继续贪污盗窃，那就证明他们是根本无意接受改造和不堪挽救的坏分子。对于这类分子，绝对不能无限期地援用治病救人的方针，而必须实行严厉的法律制裁。这种法律制裁，应该被看作教育一般干部和人民的手段。对于那些较有典型意义的贪污盗窃案件，应该进行公审，当众判罪，并组织必要的报告和讨论，以提高觉悟，接受教训。同时应该号召干部和群众随时随地检举一切贪污盗窃分子。应该告诉大家：积极和贪污盗窃分子进行斗争，是一种光荣的和勇敢的革命行动，对于国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业是一种重要的贡献，因此每一个人都应该不怕困难、充满信心地起来继续和贪污盗窃分子做斗争。领导机关，则应严肃认真地处理人民和干部的检举控告，给以全力的支持。
    第三、在所有国家机关和企业单位中，必须经常不断地开展批评和自我批评，检查和揭发各种官僚主义现象，消灭一切可供贪污盗窃分子利用的空隙。有的机关让一个会计掌握现金账又掌握印鉴，兼作采买，而无人检查其工作；有的工地让一个会计管工票又兼计工时，发现财务账和材料账不符也不查对；有的贸易公司只管向外地收购站拨发货款，而不检查究竟用了多少，剩了多少；有的工厂厂长把成本的空白支票预先盖好印章，放在那里。这些一眼就看得见的明显漏洞，必须立即予以堵塞，绝对不能容许借口什么“制度要长期建设”，
  “工作要稳步前进”，而任漏洞一直存在下去，供窃贼利用。在用人方面，必须遵守严格的制度和原则，绝对不允许把刚刚在“三反”中处理过的贪污分子，不经任何考验，就不负责任地重新放到大量经手钱财的重要岗位。即使他们曾经“诚恳”悔过，或颇有业务才能，也绝对不能拿国家财产去打赌。对于一般的接触钱物的干部，则必须经常检查其工作和账目，并随时进行必要的思想作风检查。不出大问题就不作检查的现象，必须纠正。对于贪污现象严重的地区和单位，必须同时追究犯有官僚主义毛病的领导干部的责任。
    为了健全和严密财务制度，有效地防止和及时地发现贪污盗窃行为，检查和纠正各种官僚主义现象，人民监察机关的工作必须予以大力加强。经验已经证明：那里的监察工作开展得好，那里的贪污盗窃行为和官僚主义现象就能比较及时地被发觉。监察机关对企业的生产财务活动实行日常的监督检查，对于防止和发现贪污盗窃分子，有其显著的作用。因此，加强人民监察工作，是非常重要的。
