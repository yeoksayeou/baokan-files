Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 2nd: Well-informed sources indicate that the nine-nation delegations' discussions on the main principles of the agreement on a ceasefire in Indochina, as proposed in the suggestions of the People's Republic of China's delegation, have yielded some positive results. For instance, the agreement reached on May 29th to promote the rapid and simultaneous cessation of hostilities throughout Indochina is one such example. The agreement stipulates that representatives of both sides' command headquarters should meet in Geneva to discuss this issue, and local contacts should also commence.

On June 1st, preliminary talks were held between the military representatives of both sides to arrange the meeting of representatives from both command headquarters. According to available information, the French side will be represented by General Delteil and several other French officers. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam will be represented by Xie Guangbao, a member of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam delegation attending the Geneva Conference, along with several advisors, including He Wenlou.

Political commentators point out that the suggestions put forward by the People's Republic of China's delegation made an important contribution to the consideration of other military aspects related to the Indochina issue. For example, these suggestions have become the basis for reaching the following agreement: that the representatives of the command headquarters of both sides should study the deployment of troops after the ceasefire in Geneva and in Indochina, primarily studying the regrouping areas for troops in Vietnam.

The agreement on this point has been indicated in the nine-nation delegations' communiqué of May 29th.

It is pointed out that there is also a tendency to reach a greater degree of agreement on other issues raised in the suggestions of the People's Republic of China's delegation.

During the discussions, virtually no one opposed the view that, simultaneously with the ceasefire throughout Indochina, the import of all kinds of new troops and military personnel, as well as all kinds of weapons and ammunition, from outside Indochina must be stopped. This is a matter of course because otherwise, the cessation of hostilities would be unstable, and the threat of renewed war could not be eliminated. The representatives attending the meeting apparently considered this point. Therefore, one point has been made clear: the French side believes that as long as an agreement is reached on the issue of supervision, there will be no difficulties in stopping hostilities and prohibiting the import of new troops, weapons, and equipment into Indochina.

It is generally known that the issue of supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement occupies an important place in the suggestions of the People's Republic of China's delegation. This suggestion stipulates that a mixed commission should be formed by representatives of both command headquarters and that international supervision should be carried out by a neutral nations commission. It is pointed out that the representatives in Geneva have agreed in principle that such supervision should be carried out by the aforementioned mixed commission and neutral nations commission.

At the same time, it is generally known that the attitude adopted by the United States delegation during the discussion of the neutral nations commission has made it difficult to reach a consensus decision. For example, the United States side attempted to make the issue of the members of this commission dependent on considerations of political ideology; although, the political system of this or that country cannot be used as a standard when deciding whether it should participate in the neutral nations commission. Such a commission should consider the interests of the belligerent parties and be able to carry out truly objective supervision of the implementation of the terms of the armistice agreement. In this regard, the suggestion put forward by the Soviet delegation that the aforementioned commission should be composed of Poland, Czechoslovakia, India, and Pakistan has aroused great interest.

The discussion of the Indochina issue has also illustrated, to some extent, the different views on the important issue of guaranteeing the implementation of the Indochina armistice agreement. It is generally known that the Soviet delegation agreed with the French suggestion that the countries participating in the Geneva Conference should provide such guarantees. It is pointed out here that there is no disagreement on this principle. However, there are still some unresolved issues regarding how to implement this guarantee and what obligations each country should undertake.

It is further pointed out that the last point of the suggestions put forward by the People's Republic of China's delegation, namely, the mutual release of prisoners of war and detained civilians, has also received the support of the directly concerned parties. This suggestion has paved the way for reaching an agreement on this issue.

Many political observers, in comprehensively assessing China's suggestions, have emphasized the constructive nature of these suggestions. This constructive nature has been demonstrated by the entire discussion of the nine-nation delegations' meeting.

### 日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题军事方面的讨论  我国代表团的建议起着重要作用

    日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题军事方面的讨论
    我国代表团的建议起着重要作用
   【新华社二日讯】塔斯社日内瓦二日讯：消息灵通人士指出：九国代表团对于中华人民共和国代表团的建议里所提出的、关于在印度支那停火的协议的主要原则的讨论，已经得出一些积极的结果。例如，五月二十九日在促进在印度支那全境迅速地、同时地停止敌对行动的问题上达成的协议，就是一个证明。协议决定：双方司令部的代表应在日内瓦会晤来讨论这个问题，并且在当地亦应开始接触。
    六月一日，双方军事代表举行了初步会谈，安排双方司令部代表会谈的事宜。据现有的消息说，法国方面将由戴尔特尔将军和若干其他法国军官出席会谈。越南民主共和国方面将由出席日内瓦会议的越南民主共和国代表团团员谢光宝出席会谈，还有一些顾问也将和他一起出席会谈，其中包括何文楼在内。
    政治评论家们指出：中华人民共和国代表团提出的建议，对于考虑有关印度支那问题军事方面的其他问题作了重要的贡献。例如，这些建议已经成为达成下述协议的基础，这个协议就是：双方司令部的代表应在日内瓦和在印度支那当地研究停火以后军队的部署问题，首先研究在越南的军队重新集结地区问题。
    关于这一点的协议，已在九国代表团五月二十九日的公报里表明了。
    据指出，关于中华人民共和国代表团的建议中所提出的其他问题，也有在较大的程度上达成协议的趋势。
    在讨论过程中，实际上没有任何人反对这样的意见：在印度支那全境停火的同时，必须停止自印度支那境外运入各种新部队和军事人员以及各种武器和弹药，这是理所当然的事。因为，否则的话，敌对行动的停止就会不稳固，战争再起的威胁就不能消除。出席会议的代表们显然考虑到了这一点。因此，有一点已经得到表明了：法国方面认为，只要监督问题达成了协议，在停止敌对行动以及禁止把新的部队、武器和装备运入印度支那的问题是没有困难的。
    大家知道，监督停战协定的履行问题在中华人民共和国代表团的建议中占着重要地位。这个建议规定由双方司令部的代表组成混合委员会并由中立国委员会来进行国际监督。据指出，日内瓦的代表们在原则上同意应该由上述混合委员会和中立国委员会来进行这种监督。
    同时大家知道，在讨论中立国委员会问题的时候，美国代表团所采取的态度使得达成一个大家同意的决定发生困难。譬如，美国方面企图使这个委员会的成员问题取决于政治思想方面的考虑；虽然，这个或那个国家的政治制度，是不能作为在决定它是否参加中立国委员会问题时的标准的。这样一个委员会应该考虑交战双方的利益，并且能够对于停战协定条款的履行进行真正客观的监督。在这方面，苏联代表团提出的主张由波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、印度和巴基斯坦组成上述委员会的建议，引起了极大的兴趣。
    印度支那问题的讨论也同样在一定程度上，说明了在保证印度支那停战协定的履行这一重要问题上的不同看法。大家知道，苏联代表团同意法国的建议，就是由参加日内瓦会议的国家提供这种保证。据此间指出，在这个原则问题上没有什么分歧。不过在如何执行这种保证和各该国应该承担什么义务方面，还有一些问题没有解决。
    此间又指出，中华人民共和国代表团提出的建议的最后一点，即互相释放战俘和被拘的平民，也同样得到了直接有关方面的支持。这一点建议为在这个问题上达成协议铺平了道路。
    许多政治观察家在通盘估计中国的建议时，着重指出了这个建议的建设性。这种建设性是为九国代表团的会议的全部讨论所证明了的。
