Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, June 27th: It was previously reported that, in addition to passing several resolutions, the International Conference on Easing Tensions also adopted some suggestions drafted by the conference's various groups.

    Suggestions from the Political Group on the German Question
    The participating representatives believe that peace is indivisible and that a peaceful resolution of the German question is of great significance for easing international tensions.
    The progress of the Geneva talks makes it possible, and indeed necessary, to resume the Four Power talks in Berlin, which were previously interrupted, as soon as possible.
    In order to enable the German people to participate in solving the problem of their own future, it would be best if the governments of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic could both participate in such talks.
    The talks must lead to the peaceful reunification of Germany through democratic methods and the conclusion of a peace treaty that guarantees the security of Germany's neighbors and all of Europe.
    To achieve this goal, no steps should be taken before or during the negotiations that aim to rearm Germany in any form or allow Germany to join any military treaty.

    Suggestions from the Political Group on Disarmament and Weapons of Mass Destruction
    The representatives participating in the International Conference on Easing Tensions firmly support the principle enshrined in the United Nations Charter that renounces war as a method of resolving international disputes.
    Moreover, we believe that the mad arms race, which is a heavy burden on everyone, especially the rapid development and stockpiling of atomic and hydrogen bombs, as well as the testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs, which has caused countless losses and aroused widespread indignation, will deepen international tensions sufficiently to lead to war.
    Therefore, we request that the governments of all countries capable of producing atomic and hydrogen bombs agree to cease further testing of such weapons and simultaneously declare that they will not use such weapons in war.
    We strongly urge the parties concerned to negotiate in the United Nations Disarmament Commission and to immediately conclude a treaty that prohibits the use of all such weapons, while making the necessary guarantees for unimpeded and regular supervision.
    We call on governments to conclude a treaty on effective and fair disarmament, including the reduction of armed forces and all kinds of weapons.
    Although only a few countries are manufacturing atomic weapons, all countries in the world are in danger of being affected by them. Therefore, the conference supports Prime Minister Nehru's appeal to the people of the world: to express their unease and express their will as effectively as possible in order to stop the development of powerful means of destruction that threaten all mankind.
    The results of public activity will depend on the extent to which people are aware of the threat of atomic war and the extent to which they understand what needs to be done to avoid this threat.
    The conference also calls on governments and various groups, especially scientists, to do their utmost to create sound, well-informed public opinion on this issue.
    The conference welcomes all suggestions for the peaceful use of atomic energy, but these suggestions will be more easily accepted and applied if a treaty prohibiting the use of atomic energy for military purposes is concluded beforehand. Only then can scientific and technological resources be fully utilized to meet the immediate needs of mankind.

    Suggestions from the Political Group on the United Nations, Security, and National Independence
    The representatives of the International Conference on Easing Tensions believe that:
    The United Nations Charter should be applied in accordance with its spirit and letter, so that it does not disappoint the hopes of the people of all countries;
    The People's Republic of China should be given its seat in the United Nations without delay;
    All countries, regardless of their social and political systems, should be given the opportunity to join the United Nations if they have hoped to do so in the past or now, and the United Nations should become an all-inclusive organization. In this way, the United Nations can play its greatest role in easing international tensions.
    The conference affirms that dividing the world into two hostile blocs and the resulting military deployments are a serious threat to the cause of peace. The conference opposes military treaties or military blocs aimed at deepening tensions or leading to such results.
    The conference advocates the conclusion of treaties of non-aggression and security treaties, in which all relevant countries, regardless of their political and social systems, can participate on an equal basis in accordance with the United Nations Charter. In this way, it will be possible to end the Cold War and promote the spirit of cooperation among all countries in the world.
    The conference declares that the rights of national self-determination and independence are only valuable when they are truly guaranteed to the people of all countries.
    Therefore, the conference believes that the people of dependent countries should gain freedom, handle their own affairs, and freely control their natural wealth and the fruits of their labor.
    The conference declares that acts of violence that are now openly violating the will of people everywhere should be stopped, and all racial discrimination should be abolished.
    The national independence and self-determination of the people of all countries are also the main conditions and the most reliable guarantee of world peace.

    Suggestions from the Cultural Issues Group
    I. At present, the desire of people of all countries to ease international tensions is stronger than ever. The International Conference held in Stockholm from June 19 to 23, 1954, emphasized that cultural exchanges between countries are of paramount importance for establishing an atmosphere of mutual understanding and trust necessary for consolidating and maintaining peace. As long as scientists, artists, workers in various industries, students, athletes, etc. visit other countries, they have the opportunity to establish direct contact with each other. This makes it possible for them to understand ways of life that are different from their own and to respect these ways of life.
    The conference calls on all organizations in the world that are already working in the cultural field to expand this exchange and make it easier to carry out.
    The conference calls on them to do everything possible to obtain all necessary preferences and permits from governments.
    The exchange of creative ideas and works can bring the people of all countries closer together and make them more clearly understand the cultural treasures that we should all protect and enrich.
    II. The participants of the conference issue a call to all cultural workers, researchers, and teachers. The participants of the conference call on them to use their strength and talents in creative research and teaching work to consolidate all factors that can bring people closer together: love for humanity, respect and love for one's own nation and culture, and respect and love for the people and cultures of all countries in the world.
    Therefore, we call on them to resolutely oppose everything that is contrary to this idea and feeling, and to oppose everything that can cause mutual distrust and hostility among the people of all countries.
    In this way, they will be able to work fruitfully to consolidate human peace. This is a necessary prerequisite for the development of culture.

### 缓和局势国际会议政治和文化小组的建议

    缓和局势国际会议政治和文化小组的建议
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社斯德哥尔摩二十五日讯：前曾报道：缓和局势国际会议除了通过一些决议以外，还通过了会议各小组所拟出的一些建议。
    政治小组关于德国问题的建议
    与会代表认为，和平是不可分割的，并认为德国问题的和平解决对于国际紧张局势的缓和具有重大的意义。
    日内瓦会谈的进展使得尽早恢复在柏林中断的四国会谈成为可能，而且是必须的。
    为了使德国人民能够参加解决他们自己的前途的问题，德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国政府最好都有可能参加这种会谈。
    会谈必须通过民主方法导致德国的和平统一，并且缔结一个能保证德国邻国和全欧洲的安全的和约。
    为了达到这个目的，在谈判前和谈判过程中，必须不采取旨在以任何形式重新武装德国或让德国加入任何军事条约的任何步骤。
    政治小组关于裁减军备和大规模毁灭性武器的建议
    参加缓和局势国际会议的代表坚决支持联合国宪章中否认战争是解决国际争端的方法的这一原则。
    而且，我们认为对于大家都是一种沉重的负担的那种疯狂的军备竞赛，特别是原子弹和氢弹的迅速发展和储存以及已经造成无数损失并引起普遍愤慨的原子弹和氢弹的试验，都会加深足以导致战争的国际紧张局势。
    因此我们要求能够生产原子弹和氢弹的一切国家的政府同意停止不再试验这种武器，并同时宣布它们不在战争中使用这种武器。
    我们极力主张有关各方在联合国裁军委员会中进行谈判，并不再拖延地立即缔结规定禁止使用各种类似武器的条约，同时为进行不受阻碍的和经常的监督作出必要的保证。
    我们号召各国政府缔结一个关于有效和公平地裁军的条约，其中包括裁减武装部队和各种武器。
    虽然只有一些国家在制造原子武器，但是世界各国都有遭受其影响的危险。因此，会议支持尼赫鲁总理对世界各国人民的呼吁：要他们表示他们的不安和尽可能有效地表示他们的意志，以便制止威胁全人类的强大毁灭手段的发展。
    公众活动的成果将取决于人民意识到原子战争的威胁的程度，以及他们对为了避免这种威胁需要做些什么这点所了解的程度。
    会议同时要求各国政府、各种团体、首先是科学界人士尽最大力量来为这个问题创造健全的、消息灵通的舆论。
    会议欢迎一切关于和平使用原子能的建议，但是假如在此以前，先缔结一个禁止把原子能用于军事目的的条约的话，这些建议将比较容易被接受和应用。只有做到这一点以后才能充分利用科学和技术资源来满足人类的切身需要。
    政治小组关于联合国、安全和民族独立的建议
    缓和局势国际会议代表认为：
    联合国宪章的运用应该符合于它的精神和文字，俾使它不致辜负各国人民的希望；
    应该毫不迟延地给予中华人民共和国以它在联合国的席位；
    一切国家不论它们的社会和政治制度如何，只要它们过去或现在希望加入联合国，就应该得到这个机会，联合国应该成为无所不包的组织。这样，联合国才能在缓和国际紧张局势中发挥最大的作用。
    会议确认，将世界分成两个敌对的集团和由此而产生的军事部署是对和平事业的严重威胁。会议反对旨在加深紧张局势或导致这种结果的军事条约或军事集团。
    会议主张缔结互不侵犯条约和安全条约，一切有关国家，不问其政治和社会制度如何，都可以在平等的基础上根据联合国宪章参加这些条约。这样，就会有可能结束冷战，发扬世界各国合作的精神。
    会议宣布，只有在各国人民的自决和独立的权利真正得到保障的时候，这些权利才有价值。
    因此，会议认为，附属国人民应当获得自由，应当自己处理自己的事务，自己自由地支配自己的天然财富和自己的劳动果实。
    会议宣布，现在公开违反世界各地人民意志的强暴行动应当停止，一切种族歧视应当废除。
    各国人民的民族独立和自决权同时也是世界和平的主要条件和最可靠的保证。
    文化问题小组的建议
    一、目前各国人民对缓和国际紧张局势的愿望比任何时候都强烈。一九五四年六月十九日至二十三日在斯德哥尔摩举行的国际会议着重指出，各国人民的文化交流对建立为巩固和维持和平所必需的互相谅解和信任的空气，具有头等重要意义。只要科学家、艺术家，各种行业的工人、学生、运动员等访问别国，他们就有可能互相建立直接接触。这使他们有可能了解和自己不同的生活方式，并尊重这种生活方式。
    会议号召世界各国已在文化方面进行工作的一切组织扩大这种交流，并使其能更顺利地进行。
    会议号召它们竭尽一切力量，以便能从各国政府那里取得各种必要的优惠和允许。
    创作思想和作品的交流能使各国人民互相接近，并使他们更明确地了解那些大家都应该予以保护并使之丰富的文化宝藏。
    二、会议的参加者向一切文化工作者、研究工作者和教师发出号召。会议参加者号召他们在创作研究和教学工作中发挥自己的力量和才能，以巩固能使人与人之间更加接近的一切因素：对人类的热爱，对自己民族和自己的文化的尊重和热爱，以及对世界各国人民和各国文化的尊重和热爱。
    因此我们号召他们坚决反对一切与这种思想和感情相违背的东西，反对一切能引起各国人民互不信任和仇视的东西。
    这样他们就能够有成果地进行工作，以巩固人类和平。这是发展文化的必需前提。
