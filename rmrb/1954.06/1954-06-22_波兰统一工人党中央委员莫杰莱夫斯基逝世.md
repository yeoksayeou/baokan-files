Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw: According to the Polish Press Agency, Zygmunt Modzelewski, member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, member of the State Council of the Polish People's Republic, member of the Presidium of the Polish Academy of Sciences, and Director of the Institute of Social Sciences of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, passed away on June 18th. Modzelewski was born in 1900 in Częstochowa to a railway worker's family. He engaged in revolutionary activities at an early age and was constantly persecuted by the bourgeois government, having been imprisoned multiple times in Częstochowa, Krakow, Warsaw, and Lublin. After the liberation of Poland, he served as the first Polish ambassador to the Soviet Union. From February 1947, he served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland. Throughout his diplomatic activities, he steadfastly implemented the Party's policies, defended the interests of the Polish working people and the interests of the Polish People's Republic, and struggled to safeguard Poland's independence and sovereignty on the basis of an unbreakable alliance with the Soviet Union. In 1951, he had to resign from his position as Minister of Foreign Affairs due to serious illness. In recent years, he focused his main energy on scientific research.
