    How We Ensure the Implementation of the System of One Leader Responsibility
    Li Min, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of the Iron Smelting Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel Company

    Last November, we began to implement the system of one leader responsibility based on production area management, according to the instructions of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry. Before this, the Iron Smelting Plant had gradually established a regional management system. However, because we had not systematically educated the staff and workers about the principle of one leader responsibility, everyone was not very clear about it. Therefore, the system, especially at the two levels below the factory director, was not well implemented. There were still phenomena of unclear responsibilities and even no one being responsible in production command. This time, when implementing the system, we strengthened the Party's political and ideological work.

    In the process of implementing the system of one leader responsibility, the Party organization first educated the Communist Party members to take the lead in unconditionally obeying all orders and instructions issued by the shift leader and shift technician regarding production, and to ensure that they report any problems occurring in production to the shift leader and foreman, so that administrative leaders can accurately grasp the situation. The Party group meetings included this as one of the inspection contents. At the same time, each branch consciously established the prestige of the shift leader and foreman from all aspects, educated the staff and workers to obey administrative leadership, and constantly struggled against phenomena of disobedience to command and violation of labor discipline. In November last year, the No. 4 blast furnace experienced uneven distribution of materials at the top of the furnace. The factory director proposed a test method and designated a class of workers to conduct the test. After the shift leader gave the instructions, the charging workers found it troublesome. They followed the method when the shift leader was present, but stopped when he left. After the shift leader discovered this problem, he told the branch about the situation and asked the Party for support. The branch immediately talked to the workers, explained the principle of one leader responsibility, mobilized the workers to obey command, and at the same time explained to the workers why such a test was necessary, asking the workers to carry it out seriously. The branch also talked to the activists in this class, asking them to become the backbone of executing the instructions. After the workers understood the reasoning, they completely followed the shift leader's instructions to conduct the test, and took the initiative to report the test situation to him when he passed by. After the branch continuously educated the workers through facts, most of them were able to obey command better.

    Another measure taken by the Party committee was to help the shift leaders and technicians to check for shortcomings in their leadership work, and to establish their prestige among the masses. At that time, some problems in the leadership of the shift leaders hindered the implementation of one leader responsibility. Some shift leaders were undemocratic in their work style and could not listen to opinions different from their own; some shift leaders handled affairs without principle in their leadership work; and some shift leaders did not dare to take responsibility boldly. However, at the beginning, some shift leaders did not fully realize the shortcomings and harmfulness of their leadership work. Each branch took a series of measures to understand the problems in the leadership of the shift leaders, such as holding meetings of activists among the workers, symposiums of administrative team leaders, individually soliciting the opinions of technicians, and widely understanding the opinions of the masses on the leadership of the shift leaders through Party members and Youth League members among the technicians. The branches collected these opinions, analyzed and summarized them, and then gave them to the shift leaders as a reference for their self-examination. The Party committee and branches also talked to them separately to help them understand these problems. Because they received the help of the Party and the masses, the shift leaders' self-examinations were generally more profound, and the masses were very satisfied. They all said: "This method of the branch is really good." More than a month later, the Party organization held another symposium of technicians and shift leaders to continue studying the implementation of one leader responsibility. At the meeting, the Party committee encouraged their progress and pointed out the direction for their continued efforts.

    The Party organization also used great strength to specifically help the administrative leading cadres solve difficulties in their work. There were many problems in the leadership of the shift technician level. The shift technicians did not understand furnace operation and lacked organizational leadership ability to uniformly command the blast furnace; the workers outside the furnace did not obey them either, saying, "We have been doing this for so many years, these people are just wet behind the ears, they've only been here for a few days and they want to lead us." Of course, to solve this problem, it was necessary to educate the workers to obey command and to educate the technicians to boldly assume overall leadership. But relying on this alone was not enough. The technicians did have difficulties in their leadership work. If these difficulties were not overcome, it would be difficult to establish leadership prestige, and one leader responsibility could still not be implemented. Therefore, the Party organization called on the workers outside the furnace and the technicians to teach and learn from each other, and to study problems together frequently, so that the technicians could quickly grasp the work outside the furnace. Technicians lacked leadership experience, and often ran into snags after taking on leadership work. The Party organization often paid attention to giving them help and support. One young technician in the No. 1 blast furnace had always worked hard, sought progress, and had good relations with the workers. After the implementation of one leader responsibility, he wanted to earnestly lead the work of the blast furnace. Therefore, he personally handled everything, big and small; he was also very strict with his subordinates and was impatient. Whenever he saw shortcomings or mistakes, he would criticize the workers, but he did not conduct self-criticism to the masses for his own mistakes. As a result, the workers had great resentment, and some people said: "Our technicians are really bureaucratic, and they are always criticizing people." Therefore, the workers did not look for him when anything happened, and he became increasingly unaware of the workers' thoughts. At the same time, this technician also had problems with the leadership of the group leaders. There were two group leaders in his shift. The leadership style of the lead group leader was not good. He used coercion and commandism, and glared at the workers all day long. This technician did not pay attention to correcting the problems in the lead group leader's leadership, but only consulted with him and did not discuss matters with the deputy group leader. As a result, the two group leaders were not united. The deputy group leader did not ask the group leader about anything. The workers also had opinions about the group leaders, and either did not obey command or did not offer suggestions even when they knew something was wrong. As a result, the No. 1 blast furnace had five accidents of tapping hole breakouts in a row. The branch paid timely attention to this problem. After the branch committee studied the matter, it decided to take the following measures: the technician worked hard, but his leadership method was incorrect and he should be taught leadership methods; the lead group leader was divorced from the masses and the deputy group leader did not obey the lead group leader and should be criticized; at the same time, the workers should be educated about the importance of one leader responsibility and obedience to the technician's command through the facts of the losses caused to production in the past when no one was responsible. According to the decision of the branch committee, the branch secretary talked to the technician. The branch secretary first supported his spirit of boldness in taking responsibility in his work, urging him not to waver because of difficulties; but also pointed out to him: his leadership method was incorrect, and the technician should generally grasp the group leader and should not directly command the workers over the group leader, and should let the group leader report the work more, while giving him ideas and finding ways to strictly inspect and supervise his work, so that the group leader could lead the workers well, and there would be no need to do everything personally. At the same time, it was pointed out that it was also wrong to only consult with the lead group leader and not care about the deputy group leader. The branch also told him that a leader should strictly demand from his subordinates, but should be even more strict with himself, and should criticize the masses when they made mistakes, and should conduct a self-examination to the masses when there were problems in his own work, so as to establish leadership prestige. The technician was very satisfied with the Party's help, and honestly followed the Party's instructions. At the same time, the branch instructed the chairman of the trade union and the shift leader to talk to the lead group leader. However, the lead group leader never recognized his mistake of coercion and commandism divorced from the masses, and kept saying that the workers were backward and difficult to lead, and still insisted that "being an administrative cadre, you have to be like this." The branch committee studied this situation and believed that his problems could only be improved through criticism and exposure by the masses. At the same time, many group leaders were more or less carrying this kind of undemocratic leadership style divorced from the masses, and therefore decided that the trade union should convene a large meeting of the entire shift to criticize his mistakes and educate everyone. At the meeting, through a specific analysis of the tapping hole breakout accidents, he realized that the accidents were precisely the result of his failure to rely on the masses and his failure to combine one leader responsibility with democratic management. The deputy group leader and some workers were also criticized for their irresponsible behavior of not obeying command or not offering suggestions even when they knew something was wrong. After the meeting, the group leader's understanding changed, and he told the comrades of the branch: I used to look at the masses with old views, and I must thoroughly correct this in the future. At their group meeting, both he and the technician conducted self-examinations. Since then, the cadres and workers of their blast furnace have been very united, and from December last year to the end of March this year, there have been no accidents and they have completed the production plan. In order to consolidate one leader responsibility, this kind of education work must be carried out repeatedly. Sometimes, it seems that the problem is solved, but when production fluctuates, or when personnel are transferred, problems will occur again.

    Because the Party organization proactively guaranteed the implementation and consolidation of one leader responsibility, the administrative leading cadres all felt that they could not do without relying on the Party organization in their work. At one time, because of production fluctuations in the No. 2 blast furnace, the workers' piece-rate wages were affected, and the workers all complained about the technicians. After hearing about this, the technician of another shift quickly looked for the branch secretary and asked the branch to find out what opinions the workers had of him. The furnace director of the No. 7 blast furnace prepared to convene a meeting of technicians, and first sought the opinion of the branch. In the past, after being educated and reformed by the Party organization, most of the technicians in the Iron Smelting Plant approached the Party organization, seeking progress, but they were not as proactively and actively relying on the Party everywhere to strive for the Party's support and help as they are now.

    The situation of the Party workers has also changed. In the past, some branch secretaries were not at ease in doing Party work. The current several branch secretaries all have a high degree of confidence in their work. Because they have seen the effect of their work, and the work is also easier than in the past. In the past, many things were usually no one's responsibility, and when problems occurred, no one was responsible. In this way, it was very difficult to carry out specific and in-depth political work. At the same time, because no one was responsible for many trivial affairs, the workers all went to the branch, making the branch busy all day long and unable to establish a normal working order. Now, responsibilities in production are clear, and as soon as a problem occurs, it can be immediately discovered and the responsibility can be distinguished, and political and ideological work is easy to start.

    From the work of these few months, we deeply feel that in a modern large enterprise, in order to make production go well, there must be a sound scientific management system, but relying solely on the system cannot completely solve the problems. Many problems that occur in production, although specifically manifested in technical or administrative management aspects, many of these problems cannot be solved solely by management work, but must be solved by the Party organization telling the masses the political significance of economic work, and at the same time, clearing the political and ideological obstacles in various tasks, so that various systems can play a role. If it is believed that only management systems are needed and not political work, or that political work does not guarantee the realization of scientific management systems, it will bring losses to production.

    我们怎样保证贯彻一长负责制
    中共鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂委员会书记　李民
    去年十一月，我们开始根据中央重工业部的指示，贯彻按生产区域管理的一长负责制。在这以前，炼铁厂已经逐步建立了区域管理制度。但是，因为没有系统地向职工群众进行过一长负责制的教育，大家对于一长负责制的原则还不很明白，因此一长负责制，特别是厂长以下的两级，并没有很好的贯彻，生产指挥中仍然存在着职责不清以至无人负责的现象。这次贯彻一长负责制时，我们就加强了党的政治思想工作。
    在贯彻一长负责制的过程中，党组织首先教育共产党员带头无条件地服从值班长和值班技术员对生产所发的一切命令和指示，并保证向值班长与工长汇报生产中所发生的问题，使行政领导干部能确切掌握情况。党小组会把这些作为检查内容之一。各支部同时有意识地从各方面树立值班长和工长的威信，教育职工群众服从行政领导，不断地和不服从指挥、破坏劳动纪律现象进行斗争。去年十一月间，四高炉发生了炉顶布料不均的现象。厂长提出了试验办法，指定一个班的工人进行试验。值班长布置下去以后，装料工人却嫌麻烦，值班长在时就照这办法试验，走了就不干。值班长发现了这个问题后，就把情况告诉支部，要求党来支持。支部立即去和工人谈话，向工人讲解一长负责制的原则，动员工人服从指挥，同时向工人解释了为什么要做这样的试验，要求工人认真执行。支部还找了这班中的积极分子谈话，要他们成为执行指示的骨干。工人们明白了道理后，就完全按照值班长的指示做试验，值班长走过时，还主动地向他汇报试验情况。支部通过事实，不断地向工人进行教育后，大多数的工人都能够较好地服从指挥了。
    党委的另一个措施是帮助值班长、技术员检查领导工作中的缺点，在群众中树立他们的威信。当时，值班长领导中的一些问题障碍着一长负责制的贯彻。有的值班长作风不民主，不能听取和自己不同的意见；有的值班长在领导工作中无原则地看人办事；有的值班长则不敢大胆负责。但是，开始时，有些值班长对于自己领导工作中的缺点及其危害性是认识不足的。各支部采取了一系列的措施来了解值班长领导中的问题，比如召开工人中的积极分子会、行政组长座谈会，个别地征求技术员的意见，通过技术员中的党员团员广泛地了解群众对值班长领导的意见。支部把这些意见集中起来，加以分析归纳，然后交给值班长，作为他们进行检查的参考。党委和支部并分别找他们谈话，帮助他们来认识这些问题。由于得到党和群众的帮助，值班长的检查一般都比较深刻，群众很满意。他们都说：“支部的这个办法真好。”一个多月以后，党组织又召开技术员、值班长座谈会，继续研究一长制的贯彻问题。在会上，党委鼓励了他们的进步，指出了他们继续努力的方向。
    党组织还以很大力量具体帮助行政领导干部解决工作中的困难。值班技术员这一级的领导中问题很多。值班技术员不懂炉外操作，缺乏组织领导能力，不能统一指挥高炉；炉外工人也不服他们，说什么“我们干了多少年啦，这些人嘴上没毛，来了几天，就想领导我们。”当然，要解决这个问题，必须教育工人服从指挥，教育技术员大胆地担负全面的领导工作。但只靠这一点是不够的。技术员在领导工作中确实还有困难。不帮助他们克服这些困难，领导的威信就很难树立起来，一长制仍然不能贯彻。于是，党组织就号召炉外工人和技术员互教互学，经常在一起研究问题。使技术员能够很快地掌握起炉外工作。技术员没有领导经验，担负起领导工作以后，常常碰钉子。党组织便经常注意给他们帮助和支持。一高炉有一个青年技术员，他一向工作努力，要求进步，和工人的关系也很好。贯彻一长负责制后，他很想认真地把高炉工作领导起来。于是，不管大事小事他都要亲自处理；对下面要求也很严格，情绪急躁，一看到缺点或错误就把工人批评一顿，但是对于自己工作中的差错却没有向群众进行自我批评。结果引起工人很大的反感，有些人说：“我们技术员真是官僚主义，还老是批评人。”于是，工人有事也不找他了，他便越来越不了解工人的思想情况，同时，这位技术员对组长的领导也有毛病。他班里有两个组长，正组长的领导作风不好，强迫命令，成天向工人瞪眼睛。这位技术员没有注意去纠正正组长领导中的毛病，而是有事只和他商量而不找副组长一起研究。两个组长因此闹不团结。副组长有事不问组长。工人对组长也有意见，不是不服从指挥，就是明知是错，也不提意见。于是一高炉连续出了五次铁口扣漏事故。支部及时注意了这个问题。支委会研究结果，决定采取以下的措施：技术员工作努力，但领导方法不对，应该教给领导方法；正组长脱离群众，副组长不服正组长，应该给予批评；同时还应该通过过去无人负责给生产造成的损失的事实，教育工人认识一长制的重要，服从技术员的指挥。根据支委会的决定，支部书记找技术员谈了话。支部书记首先支持他工作中的大胆负责的精神，要他不要因为遇到困难而动摇；但也向他指出：他的领导方法不对，技术员在一般情况下应该抓组长而不应越过组长直接指挥工人，要多让组长汇报工作，同时给他出主意想办法，对他的工作进行严格的检查督促，这样，组长就可以很好地领导工人，就用不着事事亲自下手。同时指出，只和正组长商量而不管副组长也是不对的。支部还告诉他，一个领导者应该严格要求下面，但更要严格要求自己，群众有了差错要批评，自己工作有了问题时，更应该向群众进行检讨，这样才能树立领导威信。技术员很满意党对他的帮助，并且老老实实地按照党所指示的去做。支部同时责成工会主席、值班长去和正组长谈话。但是，正组长始终没有认识他的强迫命令脱离群众的错误，老说是工人落后不好领导，还坚持说“当行政干部，非这样不可”。支委会研究了这个情况，认为他的毛病只有经过群众的批评揭发才能有所改进，同时，不少组长都多少带有这种脱离群众的不民主的领导作风，因而决定由工会召开全班的大碰头会，来批判他的错误并教育大家。会上，通过对铁口扣漏事故的具体分析，使他认识到事故正是他没有依靠群众，没有把一长负责制和管理民主化相结合的结果，同时也批判了副组长和有些工人不服从指挥或者明知不对也不提意见的不负责任行为。会后，这位组长的认识转变了，他向支部的同志表示：我过去老拿旧的观点来看群众，以后一定要彻底改正。在他们的小组会上，他和技术员都进行了检讨。以后他们高炉的干部和工人就团结得很好，从去年十二月到今年三月底一直没出事故，完成了生产计划。为了巩固一长制，这种教育工作要反复进行。有时候，看起来问题解决了，但是，生产一波动，或者人员一调动，又会发生问题。
    因为党组织主动地保证一长负责制的贯彻和巩固，行政领导干部都感到工作中非依靠党组织不可。有一个时候二高炉因为生产波动，工人的计件工资受到影响，工人便都埋怨技术员。另一个班的技术员听到了这件事后，便赶忙找支部书记，请支部了解一下，看工人对他有些什么意见。七高炉炉长准备召开技术员会议，事先找支部征求意见。过去，炼铁厂的技术人员经过党组织的教育改造，大都靠近党组织，要求进步，但是，还不像现在这样主动地积极地处处依靠党争取党的支持和帮助。
    党工作人员的情况也有了改变。过去，有些支部书记不安心做党的工作。现在的几位支部书记工作信心都很高。因为他们看到了工作的效果，同时工作也比过去好作了。过去很多事情平常谁也负责，出了问题，谁也不负责。这样，要进行具体的比较深入的政治工作就很困难。同时，好多琐碎的事务工作，因为没人负责，工人们便都去找支部，使支部终日忙乱，建立不起正常的工作秩序。现在生产中责任分明，一出问题立刻就可以发现并分清责任，政治思想工作也就容易入手。
    从这几个月的工作中，我们深深感到，在现代化的大企业中，要使生产进行得好，必须有健全的科学的管理制度，但是，仅仅依靠制度是不能完全解决问题的。生产中发生的许多问题，虽然具体表现在技术或行政管理方面，但是，其中有不少问题不是仅仅由管理工作所能解决得了的，而必须党组织把经济工作的政治意义告诉群众，同时，清除各项工作中的政治思想上的障碍，这样，各种制度才能发挥作用。如果认为只要管理制度而不要政治工作，或者政治工作不去保证科学管理制度的实现，就都会给生产带来损失。
