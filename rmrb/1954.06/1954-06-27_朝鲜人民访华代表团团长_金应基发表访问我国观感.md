Xinhua News Agency, June 26th: Kim Ung-gi, the head of the Korean People's Delegation to China, gave a radio address expressing his impressions of his visit to China before returning home. The full text of the speech is as follows: Dear Chinese brothers and sisters!

Our Korean People's Delegation to China has completed nearly three and a half months of visit and is now about to return home.

This time, the purpose of our delegation's visit to China is not only to strengthen the traditionally friendly unity that has existed historically, but also to strengthen the friendship and unity cemented by the blood of the people of China and Korea in the Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War against American armed aggression and in the Chinese people's movement to resist America and aid Korea; to further promote cultural exchanges between the two countries; to visit the achievements made by the great Chinese people in the struggle to build a new China; and to study and research the valuable experience of the Chinese people.

Our delegation and art troupe are composed of cadres from various political parties and social organizations in Korea, as well as combat heroes, labor heroes, scientific workers, educational workers, writers, and artists. Since our arrival in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, on March 14, we have visited the glorious revolutionary holy sites of the Chinese people and 28 cities and minority areas in North China, Northwest China, Southwest China, East China, Central South China, and Northeast China, which occupy important positions in the socialist construction of the Chinese people, under the deep care of the Communist Party of China and the Government of the People's Republic of China and with the active assistance of local Party and government organs and social organizations.

In these places, we visited many factories, rural areas, educational, cultural, and health institutions, and cadres, workers, farmers, youth, women, scientific workers, educational workers, cultural and artistic figures, and ethnic minorities from Chinese Party and government organs and social organizations, and conducted 129 artistic performances.

We conveyed to the broad masses of the Chinese people the gratitude and admiration of the Korean people for the fraternal Chinese people. This is because, in the Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War, the Chinese people not only held high the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, giving our Korean people enormous material and spiritual assistance, but also sent the Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of outstanding sons and daughters, to the Korean front; and continue to give us material and technical assistance in the post-war period. At the same time, we conveyed the close coordination between the Chinese and Korean troops during the war and the achievements made in post-war reconstruction with the meticulous assistance of the great Soviet Union, China, and the people of other people's democratic countries, as well as the determination and new fighting will shown to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

We also visited hospitals for the wounded and sick and schools for veterans; and comforted the volunteer soldiers who have now returned to their homeland for recuperation and the families of martyrs and servicemen of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Dear Chinese brothers and sisters!

This visit is of great significance in further consolidating and developing the friendship and unity between the people of the two countries cemented by blood.

Our delegation received warm welcomes and hospitality from the fraternal Chinese people everywhere, from the plateaus of Inner Mongolia to the Pearl River in South China, and from the Songhua River all the way to the Southwest.

The Chinese people warmly welcomed us as if we were their own brothers and sisters, and expressed boundless love and sincere feelings to the Korean people.

We have also received many letters, all of which sincerely expressed the deep friendship of the Chinese people for the Korean people. Through this visit, we have once again realized how deep the friendship of the Chinese people for the Korean people is, and how precious the friendship and unity cemented by blood is.

As we leave Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the fraternal Chinese people for their warm welcome during our visit.

We have all seen with deep gratitude the high enthusiasm of the Chinese people in continuing to deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and the excellent example of the Chinese people sparing no effort to assist our post-war construction.

We would like to express our warm gratitude and respect to the Chinese brothers and sisters who, under the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, are actively supporting our post-war construction with patriotic production increase struggles and through practical actions.

We have also seen the ideological and political unity of the multi-ethnic Chinese people, who are united like iron around the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and Chairman Mao Zedong; we have seen the solemn struggle being waged for the prosperity and strength of the motherland – the People's Republic of China; we have seen the high enthusiasm for creating their own happy and fulfilling lives; and we have seen the achievements made in the struggle to build a new China under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong since the founding of the great People's Republic of China, and the happy lives of the Chinese people due to the improvement of their material and cultural living standards.

We have fully appreciated the brilliant Chinese national culture with its historical traditions and the excellent people's art, as well as the achievements of the new China in people's education and health care, and have learned many valuable experiences from here.

We have also seen the heroic spirit of the glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army and its creative labor achievements for the peace of the Chinese people, as well as its heroic posture of standing firmly on the front lines of the motherland to defend the security of its own country and peace in Asia.

China has a population of 600 million. The brave and hardworking Chinese people all love their motherland. They are making fertile fields even more fertile, transforming nature, building new factories, enterprises, railways, schools, hospitals, and cultural institutions, and making unremitting efforts to build China into a great socialist industrialized country. This spirit has greatly encouraged us. We sincerely wish the fraternal Chinese people greater achievements and victories in their future construction endeavors.

Through three and a half months of visits and activities, all the great and solemn facts we have seen and heard have left us with indelible and profound impressions.

After returning home, we must convey these vivid deeds to the Korean people in detail to strengthen the friendship and unity between the people of China and Korea, and to inspire and mobilize the labor enthusiasm of the Korean people to invest in the reconstruction of the post-war national economy.

Dear Chinese brothers and sisters!

Now, the Korean people are determined to demand a peaceful solution to the Korean problem, and for this purpose, they are consistently struggling.

However, the American ruling clique, which opposes peace, disregarded the unanimous wishes of the Korean people and all peace-loving people in the world and the efforts made by the delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, and deliberately broke off the negotiations on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference.

Although American imperialism has unilaterally broken off the negotiations on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, it has no power to weaken the unanimous desire and firm will of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of Korea.

The Korean people, united like steel around the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, will surely achieve the peace and unity of the motherland.

The Korean people are convinced that the further consolidation and development of this internationalist friendship and unity between the people of China and Korea, cemented by blood, will become a great force in defending the freedom and happiness of the two peoples and in defending the cause of peace in the Far East and the world.

In the ranks of the powerful world peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union, this strength between the people of China and Korea, as strong as steel, will surely shatter any conspiracies and tricks of the imperialists who attempt to undermine our just cause.

Let us work together to promote economic and cultural cooperation between China and Korea, further strengthen the traditional friendship and unity between the people of the two countries, and work together for lasting world peace!

Finally, as we leave Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, our Korean People's Delegation to China sincerely wishes: Under the brilliant light of the general line of the transition period, the fraternal Chinese people will achieve new successes in the great cause of realizing socialist construction and socialist transformation.

    朝鲜人民访华代表团团长
    金应基发表访问我国观感
    【新华社二十六日讯】朝鲜人民访华代表团团长金应基在离京回国前，发表访华观感的广播演说。演说全文如下：亲爱的中国兄弟姊妹们！
    我们朝鲜人民访华代表团已经结束了将近三个半月的访问工作，现在就要回国了。
    这一次，我们代表团访问中国的目的不仅是在于加强历史上已经存在的传统的友好团结，而且还在于加强在朝鲜人民反对美国武装侵略的祖国解放战争中和在中国人民的抗美援朝运动中，中、朝两国人民以鲜血凝结成的友谊团结；进一步促进两国的文化交流；参观伟大的中国人民在新中国的建设斗争中所取得的成就以及学习和研究中国人民的宝贵经验。
    我们代表团和艺术团是以朝鲜的各政党、各社会团体的干部和战斗英雄、劳动英雄、科学工作者、教育工作者、作家、艺术家等所组成的。我们从三月十四日到达中华人民共和国首都——北京以来，就在中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府的深切关怀下，在各地方党、政机关和社会团体的积极帮助下，访问了光荣的中国人民的革命圣地和中国人民在社会主义建设事业上占有重要地位的华北、西北、西南、华东、中南、东北等地区的二十八个城市和少数民族地区。
    在这些地方，我们访问了许多工厂、农村、教育文化和保健卫生机关和中国党政机关及社会团体的干部、工人、农民、青年、妇女、科学工作者、教育工作者、文化艺术界人士和少数民族，进行了一百二十九次的艺术演出。
    我们向广大的中国人民传达了朝鲜人民对兄弟般的中国人民的谢意和敬仰。因为中国人民在朝鲜人民的祖国解放战争中不仅高举抗美援朝的旗帜，给予我们朝鲜人民物质上和精神上以莫大的援助，而且向朝鲜前线派遣了以优秀的儿女所组成的中国人民志愿军；在战后时期仍继续给我们以物质上和技术上的援助。我们同时传达了在战争时期中、朝两国部队紧密协同作战的情形和在伟大的苏联、中国和其他各人民民主国家人民无微不至的援助下，在战后恢复事业上取得的成就以及为达成祖国的和平统一而表现的决心和新的斗争意志。
    我们还访问了伤病员和荣誉军人学校；慰问了现在回到祖国休养的志愿军将士以及中国人民志愿军的烈士家属和军人家属。亲爱的中国兄弟姊妹们！
    这次的访问，在进一步巩固和发展以鲜血凝结成的两国人民的友谊团结上有着重大的意义。
    我们代表团从内蒙古的高原到华南的珠江，从松花江一直到西南，到处受到了兄弟般的中国人民的热烈的欢迎和款待。
    中国人民像对待自己的亲兄弟一样，热烈地欢迎我们，并且向朝鲜人民表示了无限热爱和诚挚之情。
    我们还接到了许许多多的信件，这些信件都诚恳地表示了中国人民对朝鲜人民的深厚的友谊。我们通过这次访问，再一次地体会到了中国人民对朝鲜人民的友谊是多么深厚，也体会到了以鲜血凝结成的友谊团结是多么高贵。
    当我们离开中华人民共和国首都——北京的时候，我们谨向兄弟般的中国人民在访问期间对我们的热烈欢迎表示衷心的感谢。
    我们都以万分感激的心情看到了中国人民继续深入展开抗美援朝运动的高度热情，看到了中国人民不惜一切地援助朝鲜人民的优秀榜样。
    我们谨向在抗美援朝的旗帜下，以爱国增产斗争和通过实际行动，积极支援我们战后建设的中国兄弟姊妹们表示热烈的感谢和敬意。
    我们还看到了像钢铁般地团结在中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和毛泽东主席周围的多民族的中国人民，在思想上和政治上的统一，我们看到了为祖国——中华人民共和国的繁荣和富强而进行着的庄严斗争情形，我们看到了为创造自己的美满幸福生活的高度热情，我们看到了伟大的中华人民共和国成立以来，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在新中国的建设斗争中所取得的成就和中国人民由于物质文化生活水平的提高而过着幸福生活的情形。
    我们充分地欣赏了具有历史传统的灿烂的中国民族文化和优秀的人民艺术，以及新中国在人民教育和保健卫生事业上的成就，并且从这里学习了许多宝贵的经验。
    我们又看到了光荣的中国人民解放军的英勇气概和为中国人民和平的创造性的劳动成就以及为保卫自己祖国的安全与亚洲和平而坚强地站在祖国前哨的英勇姿态。
    中国拥有六万万人口，勇敢、勤劳的中国人民都热爱自己的祖国，他们把肥沃的田地变得更肥沃，改造大自然，建设新的工厂、企业、铁路、学校、医院和文化机关，为了把中国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义工业化国家而作着不懈的努力，这种精神大大地鼓舞了我们。我们谨祝兄弟般的中国人民在今后的建设事业上获得更大的成就和胜利。
    通过三个半月的访问活动，我们所见所闻的一切伟大的庄严的事实，给我们留下了永远不可磨灭的深刻的印象。
    我们回国以后一定要向朝鲜人民详细地传达这些生动的事迹，以加强中、朝两国人民友好团结的力量，并且鼓舞动员投入恢复战后人民经济建设的朝鲜人民的劳动热情。
    亲爱的中国兄弟姊妹们！
    现在朝鲜人民坚决要求以和平方式来解决朝鲜问题，并且为此，始终一贯地斗争着。
    但是，反对和平的美国统治集团竟不顾朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民一致的愿望和朝、中、苏代表团所作的努力，在日内瓦会议上故意地破裂朝鲜问题的谈判。
    美帝国主义虽然片面地破裂日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的谈判，但决没有力量削弱朝鲜人民对和平统一朝鲜的一致愿望和坚强的意志。
    像钢铁般地团结在朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅周围的朝鲜人民，必将取得祖国的和平与统一。
    朝鲜人民深信：以鲜血凝结成的中、朝两国人民的这种国际主义友谊团结的进一步的巩固与发展，将成为保卫两国人民的自由、幸福和保卫远东与世界和平事业上的伟大力量。
    在以伟大的苏联为首的强大的世界和平民主阵营的行列中，中、朝两国人民之间的这种像钢一样的坚强的力量，一定能够粉碎企图破坏我们正义事业的帝国主义者的任何阴谋诡计。
    让我们为了促进中、朝两国经济和文化合作、进一步加强两国人民的传统友谊团结与世界持久和平而共同携手前进吧！
    最后，当我们离开中华人民共和国首都——北京的时候，我们朝鲜人民访华代表团衷心地预祝：兄弟般的中国人民在过渡时期总路线的光辉照耀下，在实现社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业上获得新的成就。
