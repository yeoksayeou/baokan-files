Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 29th: Newspapers in Delhi on the 29th all prominently published the full text of the joint statement by Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of India, on the front page with large, bold headlines.

    The "Hindustan Times" headline read, "The Five Principles of World Peace." The "Indian Express" eight-column headline read, "The Principles of the Agreement on Trade and Communication between the Tibet Region of China and India are the Only Basis for World Peace"; "Suggestions for Wider Application of These Principles are Put Forward." The "Times of India" headline read, "An Era of Peace in Asia is Established." The "Statesman" headline read, "Free and Unified Indochina is Mentioned"; "The Purposes of the Agreement on Trade and Communication between the Tibet Region of China and India are Recommended."

    The "Times of India" reported: The joint statement "presents a new era of closer cooperation among all Asian countries, regardless of political system, to establish peace in the region and promote economic reconstruction."

    The "Indian Express," in an editorial titled "Striving for World Peace," commented on the joint statement: "The three-day visit of the Chinese Premier to Delhi and its results (as demonstrated by the joint statement) are of particular significance."

    The "Hindustan Standard" editorial said that the talks between Nehru and Zhou Enlai have clearly set a new example for dealing with Asian security and peace issues. It commented: "The joint statement of the two Prime Ministers clearly stipulates some principles. Just as the two Prime Ministers affirmed in their joint statement, an Asian convention for peace can be gradually established on these principles."

    The "Statesman" reported, "The statement also issued a warning to those countries that might wish to use Indochina as a military base against its neighbors."

    The "New India Times" reported on the 29th with the headline "India and China Will Cooperate Jointly in Establishing World Peace": "The results of this meeting, which has opened a new era in Indo-China relations, will form an organized force to promote peace in Asia and the world."

    The "Hindustan Times" published an editorial on the 28th titled "A Significant Visit," saying that Zhou Enlai's visit to New Delhi, from a broader perspective of the current situation, "may prove to be a visit of the greatest significance."

    The newspaper said: "We recall that at the banquet held by Nehru to entertain the visiting Premier, all the talks and speeches revolved around one central theme: how to eliminate the fear of war and aggression that threatens people everywhere, and to ensure the maintenance of peace."

    The "Hindustan Times" welcomed Premier Zhou Enlai's written statement at the press conference on the 27th and expressed pleasure that the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers emphasized the importance of the Five Principles stipulated in the preamble to the Agreement on Trade and Communication between the Tibet Region of China and India. It said: "These principles are not only applicable to India and China, but also to other countries in Asia and the world. In a sense, these principles may be said to be a joint contribution of India and China to ending the war in Southeast Asia and restoring peace in the region."

    The newspaper went on to say: "The five principles announced by India and China do not include this obligation, but they clearly establish norms of action for the participating countries. As long as the participating countries abide by these principles, they can obtain the peace they urgently need to implement national construction and revitalization plans."

    The "Hindustan Times" compared these principles with the Western countries' proposed Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, saying that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization would divide Asia into two hostile systems, making war sooner or later inevitable. The newspaper finally called out: "Let us prepare for peace, not war. That way, war may still be avoided."

Xinhua News Agency, June 29th: According to a Warsaw report from the Polish Press Agency: I. Staretz, the Geneva correspondent of "People's Tribune," wrote: Two major events, although occurring far away from the Geneva conference hall, are closely related to the issues discussed at the conference and to broader questions of fundamental international importance. These two major events have attracted widespread attention from public opinion. One is Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Delhi, and the other is Prime Minister Churchill and Mr. Eden's visit to Washington.

    The warm welcome Premier Zhou Enlai received in Delhi, the commentaries in Indian newspapers - all of this emphasizes the significance of the meeting between representatives of the two major Asian powers, especially at a time when politicians in Washington are stepping up activities to organize an aggressive "Pacific Pact" - a pact that would not only threaten China, Indochina, and People's Korea, but also threaten India, Burma, Indonesia, and Ceylon. Therefore, this pact has been condemned by these countries, which recognize the dangers it harbors.

    The reporter said: The Washington talks are a new attempt by Dulles and Eisenhower to patch up the tattered facade of "Western solidarity." To be more precise, this is one of those meetings that Washington politicians always resort to whenever the divisions among Western allies - often between the United States and Britain - become particularly acute.

    However, this time the Washington talks are somewhat different from previous ones. The difference is that perhaps the contradictions between Britain and the United States have never been as sharp as they are now.

    Among all the numerous differences, the most prominent are two interrelated issues: the Indochina issue and the China issue. Eden's statement in the House of Commons that stopping hostilities in Indochina is the most urgent task to be completed in Asia contrasts sharply with the statements of US government leaders who believe that a ceasefire in Indochina is the worst solution (according to the "New York Times"). Furthermore, Eden said that he welcomes the improvement of British-Chinese relations, considering it beneficial to Britain and a genuine contribution to peaceful coexistence. Eden's wording also contrasts sharply with the attitude of the US government.

    However, Western newspaper commentaries acknowledge that the purpose of the Washington talks is to put pressure on the British government, and they say that this will be unprecedentedly difficult.

    The reporter concluded: "Today, one thing is already certain: just as the New Delhi talks, to some extent, indicate the efforts of Asian countries to unite in the work of safeguarding Asian security and peace, the Washington talks indicate the divisions among Western countries, which are gradually deepening, and as the aggressiveness and madness of American policy increase day by day, these divisions are bound to continue to deepen."

    印度各报发表评论
    热烈欢迎中印两国总理联合声明
    波兰报纸指出新德里会谈有助于和平事业
    【新华社新德里二十九日电】德里各报二十九日都在首页显著地位用巨字通栏标题刊载了关于中华人民共和国中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来和印度共和国总理兼外交部部长尼赫鲁的联合声明全文。
    “印度斯坦时报”的通栏标题说，“世界和平的五项原则”。“印度快报”的八栏通栏标题说，“关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定的原则是世界和平的唯一基础”；“更广泛地应用这些原则的建议提出来了”。“印度时报”的标题说：“亚洲的和平纪元确定了”。“政治家报”的标题说：“自由和统一的印度支那提到了”；“关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定的宗旨受到推荐。”
      “印度时报”报道：联合声明“提出了所有亚洲国家不分政治制度进行更加紧密的合作以建立这个地区的和平并促进经济重建的新纪元。”
    “印度快报”在题为“争取世界和平”的社论中评论联合声明说：“中国总理在德里的三天访问及其结果（如联合声明中所表明的）具有特别的重要意义。”
      “印度斯坦旗报”社论说，尼赫鲁和周恩来的会谈已经明显地作出了处理亚洲安全与和平问题的新榜样。它评论说：“两位总理的联合声明明确地规定了一些原则。就像两位总理在他们联合声明中所肯定的，争取和平的亚洲公约可以在这些原则上逐渐建立起来。”
    “政治家报”报道，“声明还对那些可能希望把印度支那当作反对它的邻国的军事基地的国家提出了警告。”
    “新印度时报”二十九日以“印中两国将在建立世界和平方面共同合作”的通栏标题报道说：“这次为印中两国关系开辟了一个新纪元的会谈的结果，将形成一支推进亚洲和世界和平的有组织的力量。”
      “印度斯坦时报”二十八日以“意义重大的访问”为题发表社论说，周恩来到新德里的访问从更广泛的时局看来“也许可以证明是意义最重大的一次访问”。
    报纸说：“我们想起，在尼赫鲁为款待来访的总理而举行的宴会中，所有谈话和演说都围绕着这样一个中心：如何消除威胁各地人民的对战争和侵略的恐惧，并且保证和平的维持。”
      “印度斯坦时报”对周恩来总理二十七日在记者招待会上的书面谈话表示欢迎，并对中印两国总理强调指出关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定的序言中所规定的五项原则的重要性表示高兴，它说：“这些原则不仅是适用于印度和中国，而且也能适用于亚洲和全世界的其他国家，在某种意义上说，这些原则也许可以说是印度和中国对于结束东南亚的战争和恢复这个地区的和平的联合贡献。”
    报纸接着说：“印度和中国所宣布的五项原则并没有包括这种义务，但是明确地为参加的国家订立了行动的规范，参加的国家只要遵照这些原则，就可以获得它们为了实行国家建设和复兴计划所迫切需要的和平。”
      “印度斯坦时报”把这些原则和西方国家的东南亚公约组织建议相比，它说：东南亚公约组织将把亚洲分割成两个敌对的体系，这样就使战争早晚难免了。报纸最后呼吁说：“让我们为和平而不是战争进行准备。这样战争也许仍旧可以避免。”
    【新华社二十九日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：“人民论坛报”日内瓦记者伊·斯塔列茨写道：有两件大事，虽然都是在离开日内瓦会议厅很远的地方发生的，却与会议上所讨论的问题，以及关于根本性的国际问题的更广泛的问题有密切关系，这两件大事已经引起了舆论的广泛注意。这两件大事一件是周恩来总理的访问德里，另外一件是邱吉尔首相和艾登先生的访问华盛顿。
    周恩来总理在德里受到的热烈欢迎，印度报纸的评论——这一切都着重说明了两个亚洲大国代表会见的意义，特别是在华盛顿的政客们正加紧活动来组织一个侵略性的“太平洋公约”的时候——这个公约不仅会威胁到中国、印度支那和人民朝鲜，而且会威胁到印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和锡兰。所以这个公约遭到了这些国家的谴责，这些国家认识到了这个公约所孕育着的危险。
    记者说：华盛顿会谈是杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔想修补“西方团结大厦”的破烂门面的新企图。说得更精确一点，这是华盛顿的政客们每当西方伙计之间——往往是美国和英国之间——的分歧特别尖锐的时候总是求助的那种会议里的一个。
    不过，这一次华盛顿会谈和以前的会谈有些不同。不同的地方就是：也许英美之间的矛盾从来没有表现得像现在这样尖锐过。
    在所有的许许多多分歧中，最突出的是两个彼此有关的问题：就是印度支那问题和中国问题。艾登在下议院说，停止印度支那敌对行动是亟须在亚洲完成的最迫切的任务，这和认为印度支那停火是最坏的解决办法（据“纽约时报”消息）的美国政府领袖的说法恰成对照。此外，艾登说，他欢迎英中关系的改进，认为这是对英国有利的，认为这是对和平共处的真正贡献。艾登这种措词也和美国政府的态度形成非常鲜明的对照。
    但是西方报纸的评论承认华盛顿会谈的目的是对英国政府施加压力，又说这将是空前困难的。
    记者最后写道：“今天，有一点是已经可以肯定的：正如新德里会谈在一定程度上表示亚洲国家为在保卫亚洲安全与和平的工作中的团结一致而努力一样，华盛顿会谈表示了西方国家之间的分歧，这种分歧正在逐渐加深，而且随着美国政策的侵略性和疯狂性一天比一天增加，这种分歧势必将继续加深下去。”
