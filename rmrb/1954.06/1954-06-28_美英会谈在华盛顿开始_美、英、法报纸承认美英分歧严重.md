Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: TASS, New York, June 26th – Talks between American and British leaders have begun, and as American observers say, they are beginning in an atmosphere of discord and misunderstanding.

The Washington correspondent of the "Christian Science Monitor" stated that in the past twenty-five years, the differences between the US and Britain have never been as serious as they are now.

Initially, American newspapers believed that the news of Churchill and Eden's trip to Washington proved that the British government had decided to revise its policy and would be closer to the US's opinions on many "major" issues, especially regarding the planned Southeast Asia military bloc.

However, Eden's speech in the House of Commons changed the American newspapers' opinions. The "New York Herald Tribune's" London correspondent believed that Eden's speech showed that the rift between the US and Britain was still as deep as it was when Dulles went to London in April. Commentator Hightower wrote that Washington's reaction to Eden's speech deepened the element of personal anger, even hostility.

Representatives of the US Congressional leadership told reporters that, contrary to existing traditions, Churchill would not be invited to speak in Congress this time.

Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: TASS, London – British local newspapers are paying close attention to Churchill, Eden, and Eisenhower's talks in Washington, mainly from the perspective of Anglo-American contradictions.

The "Manchester Guardian" published a report on this issue by its diplomatic correspondent in Geneva. The correspondent pointed out that the American and British delegations attending the Geneva Conference had different estimates of the significance of the agreement reached on the 19th regarding the ceasefire in Laos and Cambodia and other issues.

The commentator wrote: "Obviously, in the three days since the agreement was reached on June 19, this divergence has not narrowed, but has become deeper and more serious... In other words, the British, French, and other delegations in Geneva believe that this agreement is a great achievement of the conference and an important preliminary step towards achieving a glorious peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue, while the American delegation is more annoyed..."

The "Manchester Guardian" editorial also pointed out the differences between the UK and the US on the issue of establishing a so-called Southeast Asia "defense organization."

The Washington correspondent of the "Birmingham Post" also pointed out that Churchill and Eden's trip to Washington "is due to the growing concern of both governments about the increasing divergence between the United States and the United Kingdom on various international policy issues."

Speaking of Anglo-American differences, the reporter wrote: "These two allies also have differences on the issue of holding high-level talks with Soviet leaders, on policies toward Pakistan, India, Iraq, Iran, Egypt, and Israel, and on the equally important issue of Dulles' proposal to provide guarantees for 'united action' in Southeast Asia."

The reporter emphasized that the "increasing divergence" between the US and British governments and the "increasing tension" in their relations.

Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: TASS, Paris, June 26th – The Anglo-American Washington talks began under very tense Anglo-American relations, which is the main theme of Parisian newspapers' comments on Churchill and Eden's trip to Washington.

"Le Monde" wrote: "Political figures in London and Washington do not hide the extent of the differences between their two governments on many issues." "Le Monde" wrote that these differences are manifested in the Indochina issue, the Geneva Conference, and the US plan to establish a Southeast Asia military bloc, among other things.

Regarding the overall atmosphere of the talks, "Le Monde" emphasized: "In fact, the Anglo-American negotiations began in an absolutely unfavorable atmosphere. Newspapers widely point out the differences of opinion between Britain and the United States, and believe that the opinions of the two sides cannot be reconciled. To put it simply, there has been a pessimistic atmosphere since Eden delivered his speech, and it must be admitted that Eden's speech greatly annoyed the US State Department."

According to the "Paris Radical News'" Washington correspondent: "Churchill and Eden will be subjected to a series of accusations from the United States in Washington."

    美英会谈在华盛顿开始
    美、英、法报纸承认美英分歧严重
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社纽约二十六日讯：美国和英国领袖之间的谈判已经开始，正像美国观察家所说的，这是在不和和误解的气氛中开始的。
    “基督教科学箴言报”驻华盛顿记者说，在过去二十五年中间，美英之间的分歧从来没有像现在这样严重过。
    最初美国报纸认为邱吉尔和艾登华盛顿之行的消息证明英国政府已经决定修改它的政策方针，将在许多“主要”问题上，特别是在策划中的东南亚军事集团问题上比较接近美国的意见。
    不过艾登在下院的演说使美国报纸改变了意见。“纽约先驱论坛报”驻伦敦记者认为艾登的演说说明美国和英国之间的裂痕仍然像今年四月杜勒斯到伦敦去的时候那样深刻。评论员海托华写道，华盛顿对艾登演说的反应更加深了个人愤怒的因素，甚至是敌对的因素。
    美国国会领导机构的代表告诉记者们说，这一次将不顾既有的传统，不邀请邱吉尔在国会发表演说。
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国地方报纸十分注意邱吉尔、艾登和艾森豪威尔在华盛顿的会谈，而且主要是从英美矛盾这一角度来看这次会谈的。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”登载了驻日内瓦的外交评论员的一篇关于这个问题的报道。这个评论员指出，出席日内瓦会议的美国和英国的代表团对于十九日就在老挝和柬埔寨停火问题和其他问题所达成的协议的意义有着不同的估计。
    评论员写道：“显然，自六月十九日达成协议起以后的三天中，这一分歧与其说是缩小，不如说是更加深刻和严重了……换句话说，在日内瓦的英国、法国和其他国家的代表团认为，这一协议是会议的一个很大的成就，是取得印度支那问题的光荣的和平解决的重要初步步骤，而美国代表团却更加恼怒了……”。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”社论并指出了英美在建立所谓东南亚“防务组织”问题上的分歧。
    “伯明翰邮报”驻华盛顿记者也指出，邱吉尔和艾登的华盛顿之行“是由于两国政府对于美国和英国在各种国际政策问题上存在的日益加深的分歧越来越感到忧虑”。
    这个记者谈到英美分歧时写道：“这两个盟国，在与苏联领袖举行高级会谈的问题上，在应对巴基斯坦、印度、伊拉克、伊朗、埃及和以色列采取的政策问题上，以及在同等重要的、由杜勒斯建议对在东南亚实行‘联合行动’提供保证的问题上，也都存在着分歧。”
    这个记者着重指出，美英两国政府之间的“分歧日益加深”，它们之间的关系“日益紧张”。
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十六日讯：英美华盛顿会谈是在英美关系十分紧张的情况下开始的，这是巴黎报纸评论邱吉尔和艾登华盛顿之行的主要论调。
      “世界报”写道：“伦敦和华盛顿的政界人士，都不隐讳他们两国政府在许多问题上所存在的分歧的程度。”“世界报”写道，这些分歧表现在印度支那问题、日内瓦会议、美国建立东南亚军事集团的计划等方面。
    “世界报”在谈到会谈的总的气氛时着重指出：“实际上，英美谈判是在绝对不利的气氛中开始的。报纸广泛指出英美的意见分歧，并认为双方的意见无法调和。简单点说，自从艾登发表演说之后，就存在一种悲观气氛，应当承认，艾登的演说使美国国务院十分恼怒。”
    据“巴黎激进新闻”驻华盛顿记者说：“邱吉尔和艾登在华盛顿将受到美国一连串的责难。”
