Gansu Province Completes Spring Afforestation

The spring afforestation in Gansu Province has concluded. By late May, the province had afforested approximately 100,000 mu. Farmers in various regions are now protecting and tending to the young trees.

This year, Gansu's afforestation focus was on windbreak forests in the Hexi Corridor and bank protection forests along the upper reaches of the Jing and Wei Rivers. As early as January of this year, the Gansu Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry sent cadres to the upper reaches of the Jing River to conduct surveys of suitable afforestation land. When arranging spring plowing and production work, Party and government leading organs in various regions also arranged afforestation work. Some areas also taught basic afforestation knowledge in grassroots cadre training classes. State-owned nurseries had prepared large quantities of seedlings and seeds in advance. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various regions included afforestation in their production plans. Therefore, this year's spring afforestation plan was completed relatively well. The Pingliang Special District originally planned to build 25 kilometers of bank protection forests along the Jing River in Pingliang, Jingchuan, and other places, but completed 35 kilometers. After the spring afforestation ended, farmers in various regions promptly formulated plans to protect and tend to the young trees. Farmers in the Third District of Yuzhong County watered the young trees every ten days. In Minqin County, farmers in Maolin, Gengming, Xuebai, Songsi and other four villages in the First and Second Districts, under the initiative of Xue Wanxiang, a model forester in Northwest China, established a joint forest protection committee and were responsible for protection in sections. In order to improve the survival rate of trees and prevent damage from livestock, many areas promptly irrigated the forest land with spring water, and some built dams or dug trenches near the forest land.

    甘肃省春季造林结束
    甘肃省春季造林结束，到五月下旬全省共造林约十万亩。现在各地农民都在保护幼林和抚育幼林。
    甘肃今年造林的重点是河西走廊的防沙林和泾河、渭河上游的护岸林。早在今年一月份，甘肃省人民政府农林厅就派干部到泾河上游进行了宜林地调查。各地党政领导机关在布置春耕生产工作时，同时布置了造林工作。有些地区还在基层干部训练班讲授了造林常识。各个国营苗圃事前都准备好大批树苗树籽。各地农业生产合作社、互助组都把造林列入生产计划。因此，今年春季造林计划完成得比较好。平凉专区原计划在平凉、泾川等地泾河沿岸营造护岸林二十五公里，结果完成了三十五公里。春季造林结束后，各地农民群众便及时订出了保护幼林和抚育幼林的计划。榆中县第三区农民每隔十天给幼林浇水一次。民勤县一、二区茂林、更名、薛百、宋寺等四乡农民，在西北林业模范薛万祥的倡议下，成立了联合护林委员会，分段负责保护。为了提高树木成活率，防止家畜残害，许多地区的林地都及时浇灌了春水，有的并在林地附近打了坝墙或挖了壕沟。　（新华社）
