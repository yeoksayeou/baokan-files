Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 2nd: State-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories in Tianjin are actively promoting the advanced experience of technical innovation from Anshan Iron and Steel Company. Workers in more than ten industries, including metallurgy, machinery manufacturing, textiles, rubber, and transportation departments, have put forward more than 600 rationalization proposals after learning from Anshan Iron and Steel Company's advanced experience in technical innovation. Many of these proposals solve key production problems that factories had not previously resolved. The central task of the state-owned Tianjin Bicycle Factory is to improve product quality. Among the 25 suggestions they put forward this time, 10 are aimed at solving quality issues. Tianjin's model worker, Yan Chunhong, along with veteran technicians and engineering personnel, collectively improved the quality of five types of parts, including the bicycle frame's bottom bracket, ensuring that the angles of these parts meet specifications. Workers at the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant's Branch No. 1 and Branch No. 2, after studying the automation experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's small rolling mill, plan to convert rolling steel, wire drawing, and other processes to automation. The local state-owned Tianjin Rolling Mill used to experience the problem of steel bars "jumping the groove" frequently after installing the anti-circumferential disk. Technicians and veteran workers tried to improve it several times without success. This time, after studying Zhang Mingshan's anti-circumferential disk at the "Anshan Iron and Steel Company Technical Innovation Exhibition," they discovered that the "jumping the groove" problem was mainly due to the lack of springs on the anti-circumferential disk and the non-standard size of the nozzle. They are now planning to improve it. Some factories, while studying technical innovations, have also organized technical research groups and specialized groups to study and solve key production problems.

In promoting Anshan Iron and Steel Company's technical innovation experience, many factories have strengthened their work on rationalization proposals. The Tianjin Bicycle Factory has established organizational structures for rationalization proposals, with leading cadres such as the factory director and workshop directors taking responsibility for leadership.

From the beginning of May, the Industrial Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions jointly organized more than 1,000 people, including labor models, veteran technicians, engineering personnel, and responsible cadres from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, to visit the "Anshan Iron and Steel Company Technical Innovation Exhibition" in Beijing. After returning from the visit, the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions also held separate symposiums for labor models and engineering personnel. Many factories also organized factory, workshop, and team-level employee meetings and symposiums, where visiting representatives conveyed Anshan Iron and Steel Company's technical innovation experience and discussed the direction of innovation in their own units. The state-owned Tianjin No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory also held a small-scale technical innovation exhibition. These initiatives have played a significant role in promoting Anshan Iron and Steel Company's technical innovation experience.

    天津市许多工厂推广鞍钢技术革新经验
    职工提出大批合理化建议解决生产关键问题
    【新华社天津二日电】天津市国营、地方国营和公私合营工厂积极推广鞍钢技术革新的先进经验。冶炼、机器制造、纺织、橡胶等十多个行业和交通运输部门的职工，在学习鞍钢技术革新的先进经验以后，共提出合理化建议六百多件。其中有许多是解决各厂以前没有解决的生产关键问题。国营天津自行车厂的中心任务是提高产品质量，这次他们提出的二十五件建议中，有十件是解决质量的。天津市劳动模范阎春洪和老技术工人、工程技术人员等集体改进了车架子五通（自行车零件）等五种零件的质量，使这些零件的角度合乎规格。国营天津钢厂一分厂、二分厂职工学习鞍钢小型轧钢厂自动化的经验，计划把轧钢、拔丝等工段改为自动化。地方国营天津轧钢厂过去安装了反围盘后，经常发生钢条“跑槽”的毛病，技术人员和老工人几次想改进都没有成功。这次他们在“鞍钢技术革新展览会”中学习了张明山的反围盘后，研究出“跑槽”的毛病主要是反围盘上缺少弹簧及咀子的尺寸不合标准，现正计划改进。有的工厂在研究技术革新中，还组织了技术研究组和专业小组，研究解决生产中的关键问题。
    在推广鞍钢技术革新的经验时，许多工厂都加强了合理化建议工作。天津自行车厂合理化建议的组织机构，并由厂长、车间主任等主要干部负责领导。
    从五月上旬起，中共天津市委工业部和天津市工会联合会，就先后组织了各厂劳动模范、老技术工人和工程技术人员，以及党、行政、工会、青年团的负责干部一千多人，前往北京参观“鞍钢技术革新展览会”。参观回来后，天津市工会联合会还分别召开了劳动模范和工程技术人员座谈会。许多工厂也组织了厂、工段、车间的职工大会和座谈会，由参观代表传达鞍钢技术革新的经验，并讨论本单位革新的方向。国营天津第六棉纺织厂还举办了小型的技术革新展览会。这些，对于推广鞍钢技术革新经验起了较大的作用。
