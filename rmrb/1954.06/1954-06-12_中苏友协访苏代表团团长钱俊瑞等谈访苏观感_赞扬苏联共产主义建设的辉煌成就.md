The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association delegation visited Moscow, Leningrad, Baku, Stalingrad, Rostov, and the Lenin Volga-Don Canal. On the 9th, they left Moscow for Novosibirsk to visit, from where they will return to China. The delegation gave more than 30 reports in the Soviet Union introducing the construction of New China in various fields. Before leaving Moscow, Qian Junrui, the head of the delegation, and members such as Lü Ji, Zhang Guangnian, and Zhou Xiaoyan, talked about their impressions.

Qian Junrui said: The delegation not only witnessed the brilliant achievements of the Soviet people in building communism, but also was moved every day and every hour by the Soviet people's communist labor attitude and noble moral qualities, and was immersed in profound internationalist friendship at all times. The delegation saw that factories, schools, residences, theaters, cinemas and other buildings were being built in large numbers throughout the Soviet Union. In Moscow, skyscrapers of twenty or thirty stories have become more and more numerous. The "Palace of Science" - Moscow University, which stands on Lenin Hills, shows the peak of Soviet culture and science to the world like a giant. The heroic Stalingrad has been rebuilt from the ruins, and its scale is much grander than before the war. In the Patriotic War, all the factories in Rostov were destroyed by the German fascists, but now they have not only been completely restored, but have also surpassed the pre-war level. In Baku, we saw offshore oil wells, which not only require the latest oil extraction technology, but also must have the heroic and fearless spirit to overcome all difficulties. As for the world-famous Lenin Canal, its great project gave every member of the delegation great encouragement and further strengthened our confidence in the socialist construction of our motherland. These constructions everywhere embody the hard work and outstanding labor of the Soviet people. This is true of workers and farmers, and also of intellectuals. For example, reclaiming wasteland and fallow land is a very hard work, but a large number of Soviet engineers, technicians, and scholars, responding to the call of the Party and the government, actively participated in this work. The famous 74-year-old painter Gerasimov recently traveled to India and Egypt for three months. After returning home, he held a personal painting exhibition, exhibiting 82 wonderful watercolor paintings he painted during his trip. In the studios of the famous painter Zhukov and sculptor Manizer, their own works are piled up. Zhukov painted more than 7,000 paintings in 25 years. They said that they have endless themes to paint, and they never feel a lack of themes. Although the living standards of the Soviet people are very high, they are very simple and never waste the country's financial and material resources. Many famous writers and artists often have their sleeping places and working places together, and their household appliances are also very simple and unadorned. Their full spirit is devoted to their creative labor. The great Soviet people, closely surrounding the Party and the government, showed the highest degree of unity in thought and politics. This is the source of the invincible strength of the Soviet people. The delegation deeply felt this in the May Day parade, the participation in the celebration of the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia, and visits to various places. The Soviet people, under the long-term cultivation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have a high degree of proletarian internationalism. Their love for the Chinese people surpasses that of flesh and blood brothers. Whether in factories, in the countryside, in schools, in institutions and organizations, or in theaters, Soviet comrades are always particularly kind to the Chinese people.

Lü Ji said: What is most moving is the spirit of selfless labor and the simple and practical style that runs through all aspects. I saw that the factories and workshops were very large, and the cultural palace club was very beautiful, but the offices were very simple. In the Smolny Palace in Leningrad, I saw the two small rooms where Lenin and Krupskaya lived after the victory of the October Revolution, which were so simple, like ordinary workers' housing, and I realized that simplicity has its traditions in the Soviet Union. The delegation once heard a worker singing in his spare time in the Workers' Cultural Palace, and his level was no less than that of a professional singer. The singer Maslennikova, who once performed for the delegation, was originally a button girl, who studied at the Conservatory of Music in her spare time, and is now a famous opera actor in the Grand Theater. In the Baku Music Middle School, I saw an eleven-year-old fourth-grade girl composing music. Soviet music education has become universal and mass-based. Only in a socialist society can we see such artistic peaks.

Zhou Xiaoyan said: Before coming to the Soviet Union, it was unclear how the Soviet Union was moving towards communism. Now I know that communist construction is not only the Lenin Canal and the Moscow University building, but also the noble qualities of the Soviet people and socialist culture and art. I watched more than a dozen operas, and I was always satisfied. I felt that from the actors to the orchestra, everything reached the most perfect state.
When Ivan Susanin sang his thoughts of his motherland and daughter in the forest, many people in the audience shed tears. It is the task of art workers to give the people such a high degree of artistic enjoyment and education. When I went to the Foziling to experience life in the past, I regretted that I did not study engineering but music. Now I realize that for literary and art workers in our country's construction, the question is how to transform and improve. Soviet art has a high degree of political content, and this content is melted into a high degree of art. I saw those famous actors performing for the workers in the factory, and they were very familiar with the workers. I realized that art workers should maintain close ties with the masses.

Zhang Guangnian said: The delegation's drama workers had extensive contact with the Soviet theater circles, gained many benefits, and established contact between Chinese and Soviet theater workers. The Drama Creation Committee of the Soviet Writers' Association introduced the Soviet drama situation and recommended a batch of scripts that showed the construction during the first five-year plan and the struggle against hardship, as well as the current communist construction scripts. The Russian Dramatists Association, the editorial department of the Drama Magazine, and the Moscow and Leningrad State Drama Institutes all introduced their work experience. For example, the Dramatists Association introduced how it runs short-term training courses to train young playwrights, mainly to discuss and revise their works. In this way, many talented young people have been discovered and cultivated, and sometimes their works have won Stalin Prizes.

    中苏友协访苏代表团团长钱俊瑞等谈访苏观感
    赞扬苏联共产主义建设的辉煌成就
    中苏友协访苏代表团访问了莫斯科、列宁格勒、巴库、斯大林格勒、罗斯托夫和列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河以后，九日离莫斯科赴新西伯利亚城参观，将由那里回国。代表团在苏联作了三十多次介绍新中国各方面建设情况的报告。离开莫斯科时，代表团团长钱俊瑞和团员吕骥、张光年、周小燕等谈了他们的观感。
    钱俊瑞说：代表团不仅亲眼看到苏联人民建设共产主义的辉煌成就，而且每天每时为苏联人民的共产主义的劳动态度和崇高的道德品质所感动，无时无刻不浸沉在国际主义的深厚友谊中。代表团看到苏联各地都在大批地兴建工厂、学校、住宅、戏院、电影院等等建筑物。在莫斯科，二、三十层的高楼大厦已越来越多。矗立在列宁山上的“科学之宫”——莫斯科大学像巨人一样，向全世界昭示苏维埃文化和科学的高峰。英勇的斯大林格勒已从废墟中重新建设起来，其规模比战前要宏伟得多。在卫国战争中，罗斯托夫的工厂全部遭受德国法西斯的破坏，现在不但已经完全恢复，而且超过了战前。在巴库，看到了海底油井，这里不仅需要最新的采油技术，而且必须有战胜一切困难的英勇无畏的精神。至于举世闻名的列宁运河，其伟大的工程更给了每个团员以极大的鼓舞，更加坚定了我们对祖国社会主义建设的信心。这些建设处处体现着苏维埃人民的辛勤艰苦和卓越的劳动。工人、农民是如此，知识分子也是如此。例如：开垦生荒地和熟荒地是件很艰苦的工作，但是大批苏联的工程师们、技师们和学者们，响应着党和政府的号召，踊跃地参加了这一工作。著名的七十四岁高龄的老画家格拉西莫夫最近到印度和埃及去游历了三个月，回国后就举行个人的画展，展出他在旅途中所画的八十二幅精彩的水彩画。在著名画家茹科夫和雕塑家马尼泽尔的工作室里，满满地堆着他们自己的作品。茹科夫在二十五年内就画了七千多幅画。他们说，他们有画不尽的题材，他们决不感到缺乏题材。苏联人民的生活水平尽管很高，但是他们很朴素，决不浪费国家的财力和物力。许多著名的作家、美术家们，常常是睡的地方和工作的地方在一起，家庭用具也很简单朴素。他们的全副精神贯注在他们的创造性的劳动中。伟大的苏联人民，紧紧地围绕着党和政府，表现出在思想上和政治上的最高度的团结。这是苏联人民不可战胜的力量的源泉。代表团在五一节观礼、参加乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年纪念和各处参观中，深深感到这一点。苏联人民在苏联共产党的长期培养下，有着高度的无产阶级国际主义的精神。他们对于中国人民的热爱，胜过了骨肉兄弟。不论在工厂、在农村、在学校、在机关和团体里，以及在戏院里，苏联同志们对中国人民总是特别的亲切。
    吕骥说：最令人感动的，是贯穿在各方面的忘我劳动精神和朴素踏实作风。看到工厂和车间很大，文化宫俱乐部很漂亮，但是办公室很俭朴。在列宁格勒的斯莫尔尼宫，看到十月革命胜利后列宁和克鲁普斯卡娅当时所住的两间小房子，那样俭朴，像普通工人住房一样，领会到朴素在苏联人是有他们的传统的。代表团有一次在工人文化宫听到一位工人在作业余习唱，其水平不下于专业的歌唱家。曾经向代表团表演的歌唱家马斯连尼科娃，原来是钮扣女工，业余在音乐学院进修，现在是大戏院歌剧著名演员。在巴库音乐中学，看到一个十一岁的四年级女生在作曲。苏联音乐教育已经普遍化和群众化。只有在社会主义社会，才能看到这样艺术的高峰。
    周小燕说：没有来苏联以前，对于苏联怎样走向共产主义，是不明确的。现在才知道，共产主义建设不只是列宁运河，莫斯科大学大厦，还有苏联人民的高尚品质，社会主义的文化艺术。看了十几次歌剧，无一次不满意，觉得从演员到乐队都达到最美满的境界。
    伊凡·苏萨宁在森林中唱他对祖国和女儿的想念时，周围观众洒泪的很多。使人民得到这种高度的艺术享受和教育，是艺术工作者的任务。过去到佛子岭体验生活时，曾经懊悔当年不学工程而学音乐。现在认识到了文艺工作者在我国建设中，问题是如何改造和提高。苏联艺术都有高度的政治内容，而这种内容融化在高度的艺术中。在工厂看到那些向工人们演出的著名演员，和工人们都很熟悉。领会到艺术工作者应该和群众保持密切的联系。
    张光年说：代表团戏剧工作者，和苏联戏剧界进行了广泛接触，获得了许多教益，建立了中苏两国戏剧工作者的联系。苏联作家协会剧作委员会介绍了苏联的剧作情况，推荐了一批表现第一个五年计划时期的建设以及和艰苦作斗争的剧本和目前共产主义建设的剧本。俄罗斯戏剧家协会、戏剧杂志编辑部、莫斯科和列宁格勒的国立戏剧学院，都介绍了自己的工作经验。例如，戏剧家协会介绍它怎样举办短期训练班，调训青年剧作家，主要是讨论和修改他们的作品。这样发现和培养了许多有才干的青年，有时他们的作品得到斯大林奖金。
