    Writer - Warrior
    ——In Memory of Martin Andersen Nexø
    Anisimov, President of the Gorky Literary Institute of the Soviet Union
    Martin Andersen Nexø has passed away. He lived nearly eighty-five years, but he was always young, full of strength and ardent vitality. He was a writer - warrior, who devoted all his strength unreservedly to the struggle for the freedom and happiness of the people.
    Martin Andersen Nexø—deservedly can be called a people's writer, who embodied the character of the people with great enthusiasm in his works, regarding the ordinary and unnoticed people in his own country as true heroes.
    Martin Andersen Nexø's literary creation is magnificent in terms of quantity, diversity, and the significance of the works written. The social novel "Pelle the Conqueror" (1906-1910) brought Nexø worldwide fame. This is a work about the Danish workers' movement. The writer realistically portrays the life of the lower classes with powerful techniques, sharply depicting the oppressors and the oppressed, and exposing the irreconcilable contradictions between them. Pelle falls into the quagmire of opportunists and reformists, and the author uses him to contrast with the power of the people. Nexø's vigorous works cultivated the will of the broad masses to fight for a better future.
    When Clara Zetkin praised Nexø's second novel, "Ditte, Child of Man" (1917), she emphasized that his creation was entirely for the service of ordinary people. This novel, like all of Nexø's works, is permeated with the deepest humanism, concern, love, and trust for the working people. The novel "Ditte, Child of Man" is sharply opposed to the decadence of bourgeois literature, which strives to degrade human dignity.
    The short story "The Passengers Without Tickets" (1921) clearly reflects the profound historical changes after the First World War and the Great October Socialist Revolution. In this book "Dedicated to the fighting Russian people," Nexø is permeated with the recognition of the historical changes completed in the world. He describes the lives of the oppressed, expressing the fate of people who are figuratively called "passengers without tickets," that is, people who have been deprived of their place and position in life. The author points out with great persuasiveness: everywhere there is growing anger of resistance, everywhere there is accumulating strength, this force begins to oppose placing ordinary people in that cursed fate, and fights against the capitalist "iron century" that considers them slaves of life.
    Soon after the publication of this remarkable book, Nexø arrived in Soviet Russia.
    The feature collection "Towards the New Day" appeared after the trip, which is one of the earliest and most insightful books in which the new life of the Soviet state was demonstrated abroad. Nexø admiringly wrote that the October Revolution elevated the great people, "guiding them through a century in a few years, and placing them in the position of the pioneers of advancing mankind."
    These thoughts of Nexø, who remained an enthusiastic friend of the Soviet state until his later years, gained further development when he later talked about the Soviet Union, and showed a great influence on his entire creative path. In the 1930s, Martin Andersen Nexø, together with progressive writers such as Barbusse, engaged in the struggle against imperialist war and fascism. He cried out to defend Republican Spain, to defend peace and culture. The beneficial collection of articles "Memories" ("Childhood," "Under a Bright Sky," "Among Foreigners," "The End of the Road"), published in these years, resonated in the hearts of millions of people.
    Martin Andersen Nexø came to our country more than once, and he wrote about it passionately more than once, paying attention to the progress of socialist construction. He was proud of the achievements of Soviet literature, and he saw its strength in the unity of Soviet literature and the people.
    "There is no doubt that the conditions on which the fresh vitality of young Russian literature depends are: it grows on new spiritual soil, blossoms in the world, where everything is participated in by everyone, and everyone has a share." He paid great attention, concern, and keenly observed the achievements of Soviet literature.
    Martin Andersen Nexø's last masterpiece was the trilogy "The Mortals." The first part, "Whose is the Victory?" was published in 1945. The author was attacked by death before the writing of the third book.
    The depiction of social life that began in the novels "Pelle the Conqueror" and "Ditte, Child of Man" was developed in his new works. Martin Andersen Nexø strived to inject all his life experiences into this last work. Here, he used great satirical power to expose the social democratic traitors in the workers' movement, and pointed out more clearly than ever before the lively power of the workers' movement and the growing hatred of the masses for the oppressors.
    Nexø's works aroused fierce attacks from reactionaries. But all honest people understand that this writer showed the national pride of Denmark, and his compatriots regard Nexø as the embodiment of their superior and highest qualities.
    All of Nexø's works are for the service of the people, for those whose "faces and thoughts are facing the direction of the rising sun," and this is especially strongly expressed in his last works.
    Martin Andersen Nexø spent his last years adhering to the thorough struggle to defend peace. He was one of the most active members of the World Peace Council, and his works and all his activities were permeated with "simple but all-encompassing slogans of peace." He contributed all his strength to this. He strived to prove to the people: "Peace for labor, peace for joy, peace for making life beautiful."
    The life path of the writer and revolutionary is noble. He was one of the founders of the Danish Communist Party, a member of the Central Committee of the Danish Communist Party, and a loyal friend of the working people.
    At the Pushkin memorial meeting held at the Moscow Grand Theater, Nexø said in his outstanding speech: "The writer's position is in the vanguard of mankind." This profound and wise definition can be perfectly applied to himself. The Communist Party member Nexø is always a writer standing in the vanguard of mankind. All the bright and novel creations in his works, and all his selfless activities for the working people, will serve the cause of cultivating fighters for the happiness of the people. Those who commemorate him will gratefully remember his glorious name in their memory.

### 作家——战士——纪念马丁·安德逊·尼克索苏联

    作家——战士
    ——纪念马丁·安德逊·尼克索
    苏联高尔基文学研究院院长　阿尼西莫夫
    马丁·安德逊·尼克索逝世了。他的生命已将近八十五岁，但他一直是年青的，充满了力量和热烈的活力。他是作家——战士，他把自己的一切力量无保留地贡献给争取人民的自由和幸福的战斗。
    马丁·安德逊·尼克索——充分可以称得起是人民作家，他在自己作品中以极大热情体现出人民的性格，把自己国家中普通的和不被注意的人看作是真正的英雄。
    马丁·安德逊·尼克索的文学创作在数量上、在多样性上以及所写作品的意义上说来都是宏伟的。社会小说“彼列—征服者”（一九○六——一九一○年）给尼克索带来世界性的声誉。这是关于丹麦工人运动的著作。作家以有力的手法真实地表现出下层人民的生活，尖锐地描写了压迫者和被压迫者，暴露了他们之间不可调解的矛盾。彼列陷入机会主义和改良主义者的泥沼，作者用他来和人民的力量对比。尼克索的生命力充沛的著作培养了广大群众为美好未来而斗争的意志。
    当克拉拉·蔡特金赞扬尼克索的第二部小说“人之子”（一九一七年）时，曾强调指出了他的创作全然是为普通人民服务的。这部小说也像尼克索一切作品一样，渗透了最深刻的对劳动人民的人道主义、关注、爱情和信赖。小说“人之子”是与竭力贬低人类尊严的资产阶级文学颓废派的诡秘尖锐对立的。
    短篇小说“没有座位的旅客”（一九二一年），格外清晰地反映了第一次世界大战和伟大的十月社会主义革命以后深刻的历史变化。尼克索在“献给战斗的俄国人民”的这本书里，贯穿着对世界上完成了的历史性变革的认识。他描写被压迫者的生活，表现了这种形象化地被叫作“没有座位的旅客”的人、也就是在生活中被剥夺了自己安身之处和地位的人们的命运，作者以很大的说服力指出：到处增长着反抗的愤怒，到处积聚起力量，这种力量开始反对把普通人民委置于该诅咒的命运，对认为他们是生活的奴隶的资本主义的“铁的世纪”作斗争。
    这本值得注意的书出版以后不久，尼克索到了苏维埃俄国。
    特写集“迎接年轻的日子”在旅行以后出现，这是苏维埃国家新生活在国外得到证明的书中比较早和最为透澈的一本。尼克索赞叹地写到十月革命提高了伟大的人民，“引导他们在几年之中走过了一个世纪，而且把他们安置在前进着的人类的先驱者的地位”。
    一直到晚年都是苏维埃国家热情朋友的尼克索的这些思想，在他以后谈论到苏联时获得了进一步的发展，并在他的全部创作道路上表现了巨大的影响。在三十年代，马丁·安德逊·尼克索和巴比塞等进步作家一同从事反对帝国主义战争和法西斯主义的斗争。他高呼保卫共和主义的西班牙，保卫和平与文化。他在这些年代中发表的描写人民生活的有益的文集“回忆录”（“孩子”、“在开朗的天空下”、“在外国人里”、“道路的终点”），在千万人民心中获得共鸣。
    马丁·安德逊·尼克索到我国来过不只一次，他不止一次地热情地写到过它，注意地观察社会主义建设的进行。他为苏维埃文学的成就骄傲，他在苏维埃文学和人民的团结中看到了它的力量。
      “没有疑问，年轻的俄国文学的新鲜的元气所依存的条件是：她是在新的精神土壤上生长起来，在世界上开了花，在那里一切的事都是大家一致参加，并且都有大家的份。”他非常注意、关心、并且敏锐地观察着苏维埃文学的成绩。
    马丁·安德逊·尼克索最后的巨著是三部曲“红色的摩尔金”。第一部“谁的国家”在一九四五年出版。为了第三本书的写作，作者受到死亡的袭击。
    开始于小说“彼列—征服者”和“人之子”的社会生活的描写，在他的新作品中得到发展。马丁·安德逊·尼克索努力把他的全部生活经验注入在这最后的作品中。他在这里用巨大的讽刺力量揭露了工人运动中的社会民主党叛徒，比任何时期更鲜明地指出工人运动的活泼的力量，和群众对压迫者的增长着的憎恨。
    尼克索的作品引起反动分子猛烈的袭击。但是所有正直的人们都明白：这位作家显示了丹麦的民族骄傲，他的同胞把尼克索看作是自己优越的和最高的美质的体现者。
    尼克索的全部作品都是为人民服务的，都是为那“脸庞和思想朝向太阳上升的方向”的人服务的，而在他最后的作品中更表现得特殊强烈。
    马丁·安德逊·尼克索的最后几年坚持着保卫和平的彻底斗争。他是世界和平理事会最积极的理事之一，他的作品和他的一切活动渗透“在单纯的但是无所不包的和平口号里”。他为此贡献了自己一切力量。他努力向人民证实：“和平为了劳动，和平为了欢乐，和平为了使生活美丽。”
    作家革命家的生活道路是崇高的，他是丹麦共产党创始者之一，丹麦共产党中央委员会委员，劳动人民的忠实朋友。
    在莫斯科大剧院举行普希金的纪念会时，尼克索在他的卓越的发言中讲过这句话：“作家的地位是在人类的先锋队里。”这个深刻的、智慧的定义可以完全适合于他自己，共产党员尼克索永远是站在人类的先锋队里的作家。他的作品中的一切鲜明的、新颖的创造，所有他的为了劳动人民的忘我活动，将要替培养为人民幸福而斗争的战士的事业服务。纪念着他的人们将在他们的记忆中怀着感激地铭记着他光荣的名字。
