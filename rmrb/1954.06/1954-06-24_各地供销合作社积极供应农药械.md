    Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Various Regions Actively Supply Pesticides and Agricultural Machinery
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions are actively supplying agricultural chemicals and machinery to support farmers in preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests. According to statistics from 29 provinces and cities including Jiangsu, Shandong, and Shaanxi, over 69 million jin of pesticides and over 320,000 pieces of agricultural machinery have been prepared. Incomplete statistics from 11 provinces including Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi show that over 4.81 million jin of pesticides have already been supplied to farmers. In line with the principle of "prevention is better than cure," the Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative General Office promptly allocated 7 million jin of pesticides and nearly 20,000 sprayers to grassroots cooperatives, and at the same time, requested lower-level supply and marketing cooperatives to help the masses prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests in a timely and widespread manner. Supply and marketing cooperatives in many regions are paying attention to supplying farmers with various pesticides in accordance with the principle of "equal emphasis on grain and cotton."
    This year, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have generally paid attention to providing technical guidance in coordination with agricultural departments when supplying pesticides and agricultural machinery. In February, Jiangsu Province convened a meeting of 588 cadres from the prefectural and county-level organs of Xuzhou, Huaiyin, Yangzhou, and Yancheng special districts to impart pest control techniques; thereafter, each county conducted short-term training for village cadres, chairmen of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and heads of mutual aid groups; in Huaiyin Special District alone, more than 3,400 pest control personnel were trained, so that pest control technology has been basically mastered by the majority of grassroots cadres. When supplying pesticides, the Qianshan Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Anqiu County, Shandong Province, explained the efficacy and usage of the pesticides at any time and any place. From April 7th to 12th, the cadres of the cooperative went to the countryside with goods, sold more than 2,900 jin of "666" in 87 villages, and provided technical guidance at the same time.
    The Preparatory Committee of the Sichuan Provincial Cooperative Union has transported more than 700 tons of insecticidal agents to support farmers in grain, cotton, and fruit-producing areas to prevent and control insect pests. More than 290 agricultural technical guidance stations throughout the province have taught farmers the techniques of using agents to control insects and have prepared more than 30,000 sprayers for rent to farmers.
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in many regions have actively carried out the supply of parts and repair work for agricultural machinery. In April, the De County Cooperative Union in Shandong Province organized technicians from grassroots cooperatives to go deep into the countryside to conduct a general inspection and repair of agricultural machinery. According to statistics from eight districts, a total of 663 agricultural machines were inspected and 400 were equipped with parts and repaired in twelve days. In areas where agricultural machinery is relatively concentrated in Shanxi Province, local blacksmiths and mechanics are organized and trained to repair sprayers for farmers, with parts supplied by the supply and marketing cooperatives. This practice has been welcomed by the majority of farmers.

    各地供销合作社积极供应农药械
    各地供销合作社积极供应农业药剂和农业药械，支持农民防治病虫害。据江苏、山东、陕西等二十九个省、市的统计，已备妥的农药有六千九百余万斤，农业药械有三十二万多架。仅据山东、河南、陕西等十一个省的不完全统计，已经供应到农民手中的农药有四百八十一万余斤。江苏省合作总社根据“防重于治”的精神，将七百万斤农药和近二万架喷雾器及时调拨到基层合作社，同时要求下级供销合作社帮助群众及时、普遍地防治病虫害。许多地区的供销合作社注意按照“粮棉并重”的精神，供应农民各种农药。
    各地供销合作社今年在供应农药械的工作中，一般都注意配合农业部门，进行了技术指导。江苏省在二月间曾召集徐州、淮阴、扬州、盐城四个专区的五百八十八名专区和县级机关的干部开会，传授了治虫技术；此后，各县分别对乡村干部、农业生产合作社社长、互助组组长进行了短期训练；仅淮阴专区就训练了治虫人员三千四百多人，使治虫技术已基本上为广大基层干部所掌握。山东省安邱县前山供销合作社在供应农药时随时随地讲解农药的效能和使用方法，在四月七日到十二日六天内，该社干部带货下乡，到八十七个村销售了“六六六”二千九百多斤，同时进行了技术指导。
    四川省合作社联合社筹备委员会已运到七百多吨治虫药剂，支援各粮、棉和水果产区的农民防治虫害。全省二百九十多个农业技术指导站向农民传授了使用药剂治虫的技术，并准备了三万多具喷雾器租借给农民使用。
    许多地区的供销合作社积极进行了农业药械的零件供应和修理工作。山东省德县合作社联合社在四月间组织基层合作社技术员深入农村，对农业药械普遍进行了检查修理。据八个区的统计，在十二天内共检查农业药械六百六十三部，添配零件和修理的有四百部。山西省在农业药械比较集中的地区，组织和训练当地的铁匠、修车匠为农民修理喷雾器，由供销合作社供给零件，这一作法受到广大农民的欢迎。
