Xinhua News Agency:

    Guangdong Province's grassroots election work was completely concluded at the end of May. During the general election campaign, voters from all strata and ethnic groups enthusiastically participated in the election, from cities and villages to remote mountainous areas, islands, old revolutionary base areas, and ethnic minority regions. In the eight cities of Shantou, Zhanjiang, Haikou, Shaoguan, and Jiangmen, the average voter turnout was over 95% of the total number of eligible voters. In the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region, where residents are scattered and transportation is inconvenient, voter participation reached over 88% of the total number of eligible voters.

    Many of the representatives elected by the broad masses of voters are advanced individuals beloved by the people. For example, provincial-level agricultural labor models Wang Hanguo and Li Qiubai, Zhanjiang municipal industrial labor models Chen Jing and Lu Ziting, Leidon County fishing labor model Lin Qiaolong, and Lianjiang County mutual aid and cooperation model and director of the Shi Ning Agricultural Production Cooperative, Huang Zhaotang, were all elected with 100% of the vote. Many former good cadres, outstanding Communist Party members, and Communist Youth League members have won the greatest trust and enthusiastic support from the masses. According to statistics from more than 2,100 grassroots units in 14 counties and cities, including Taishan and Zhanjiang, more than 33,200 of the original 41,500 cadres were elected as people's representatives. Among the elected representatives are representatives from old revolutionary base areas, ethnic minorities, families of martyrs, families of military personnel, and relatives of overseas Chinese, ensuring that people from all strata have a corresponding number of representatives in the grassroots government.

    After the general election campaign, a new atmosphere has emerged in various places. After the Tie Lukeng Township in the second district of Taishan County elected township people's representatives and convened the township people's congress, the entire township enthusiastically launched a production increase emulation campaign to strive for a 25% increase in grain production this year. Industrial and commercial operators in many small and medium-sized towns, such as Rongqi Town in Shunde County and Taicheng Town in Taishan County, have raised their awareness through the general election and expressed their willingness to respond to the government's call, actively engage in business, and take the road of state capitalism.

    At present, various localities are holding or preparing to hold county- and city-level people's congresses. The Preparatory Committee for the First People's Congress of Guangdong Province has also been recently established and is actively carrying out various preparatory tasks.

    广东省基层选举工作全部结束
    广东省基层选举工作已在五月底全部结束。在普选运动中，从城市、乡村到偏僻的山区、海岛、革命老根据地和少数民族地区，各阶层、各民族的选民都热烈参加了选举。汕头、湛江、海口、韶关、江门等八个市参加选举的选民，平均占选民总数百分之九十五以上。居住分散、交通不便的海南黎族苗族自治区，参加选举的各族选民达到选民总数的百分之八十八以上。
    经过广大选民选举出来的代表，有许多都是为群众所爱戴的先进人物。如全省著名的农业劳动模范汪汉国、李球柏，湛江市工业劳动模范陈敬、卢紫庭，雷东县渔业劳动模范林乔隆，廉江县互助合作模范、石宁农业生产合作社主任黄兆棠等，都以百分之百的票数当选。许多原来的好干部、优秀的共产党员和青年团员都获得群众最大的信任和热烈的拥护。据台山、湛江等十四个县、市二千一百多个基层单位的统计，原有干部四万一千五百多人中，有三万三千二百多人当选为人民代表。在当选的代表中还有革命老根据地、少数民族、烈属、军属、侨眷等的代表人物，使基层政权中各阶层人民都有了相当名额的代表。
    各地经过普选运动，出现了一片新的气象。台山县第二区铁炉坑乡在选出了乡人民代表和召开了乡人民代表大会以后，全乡热烈展开了为争取今年增产粮食百分之二十五的丰产竞赛运动。顺德县容奇镇、台山县台城镇等许多中小城镇的工商业者，在普选中提高了觉悟，表示愿意响应政府号召，积极经营，走国家资本主义道路。
    目前，各地正纷纷召开或准备召开县、市一级人民代表大会。广东省第一届人民代表大会筹备委员会也在最近成立，积极进行各项筹备工作。
