    The Air Force of the Soviet State
    Soviet Air Force General, Hero of the Soviet Union Ye. Preobrazhensky
    Soviet Aviation Day has become a great, traditional national holiday. It is a day to review the achievements of the development of Soviet aviation, a day to review the achievements of aviation pilots and Soviet aviation industry workers.
    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government tirelessly care for the construction and development of aviation. Because of this, our air force, along with all the armed forces, is able to become a strong pillar for defending the peaceful labor of the Soviet people.
    Russia is the motherland of aviation and the motherland of advanced aviation science. In this country, the world's first balloon, helicopter, and airplane flights were carried out, and the world's first aircraft engine was created. It was the Russian scientists—Lomonosov, Lykachev, Fedorov, and Mendeleev—who created the profound theoretical basis of flight. The theoretical works of the Russian scientists Zhukovsky, Tsiolkovsky, and Chaplygin, who created many new sciences—gas dynamics, gas power, supersonic power dynamics, the principle of jet engines, and created the world's first automatic flight machine, have had a huge impact on the further development of world aviation.
    Russian naval engineer A.F. Mozhaisky designed and tested the world's first airplane in 1882.
    The great Russian scientist Mendeleev drafted the first high-altitude balloon design in 1875, and in 1887, personally ascended to a height of three thousand three hundred and fifty meters in a balloon to observe a solar eclipse. As for the parachute, it was created by the Russian inventor Kotelnikov, and the world's first seaplane was invented by the Russian designer Grigorovich.
    The first batch of aviation pioneers also appeared in Russia. These famous figures were the airplane testers designed by Mozhaisky—aviator Golubev, and the founder of advanced piloting techniques, the famous Russian aviator Nesterov.
    However, under the conditions of Tsarist Russia, aviation science could not be fully developed. Only after the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution did true prosperity appear.
    During the years of socialist industrialization in the Soviet Union, powerful metallurgical, aluminum, machine manufacturing, and other industrial sectors developed. A powerful aviation industry was established on this basis. The country was able to build a sufficient number of well-equipped, first-class aircraft. Soviet schools have trained many talented engineers and designers.
    During the years of the Great Patriotic War against Hitler's Germany and imperialist Japan, the Soviet people and their armed forces gloriously defended the independence of their motherland, crushed the enemy forces, and thereby saved the people of Europe and Asia from the threat of enslavement by German fascists and Japanese imperialism.
    Soviet pilots also demonstrated unparalleled courage in fighting the enemy. Their heroic feats established in the battles near Moscow, around Stalingrad, in the Kuban, and in the air battles near Kursk, where the myth of the invincibility of the Hitler Luftwaffe was completely shattered, are brilliant pages in the history of the Soviet Great Patriotic War. In the major counter-offensive operations of 1944, the Soviet Air Force fully demonstrated its power.
    In the last three years of the war, Soviet air force pilots and anti-aircraft gunners shot down a total of 75,000 enemy aircraft.
    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government highly evaluated the outstanding contributions of the heroic and invincible air force pilots. Two thousand one hundred and nineteen Soviet air force pilots were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, sixty-three were awarded this lofty title twice, and two world-renowned air force heroes, Pokryshkin and Kozhedub, were awarded the Gold Star Medal of Hero of the Soviet Union three times. A large number of Soviet Air Force servicemen were awarded orders and medals.
    After the end of the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet people undertook the task of restoring and further developing the national economy with extremely vigorous energy and achieved great success. The Soviet army and its air force are vigilantly guarding the peaceful labor of the Soviet people.
    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government have always consistently pursued a policy of peace and good-neighborly relations with all countries. Thanks to the unremitting struggle for peace carried out by the Soviet Union in close contact with the People's Republic of China and other people's democratic countries, international tensions have eased somewhat in recent times. The Soviet Union's peace policy has won the infinite trust of all peace-loving people for our country.
    However, the Soviet people are accustomed to soberly assessing the situation. The forces of imperialism, led by the United States, are deadly enemies of peace. Not only do they not abandon their aggressive intentions, but they are openly pursuing a policy of preparing for a new war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The atomic and hydrogen bomb blackmail of the US imperialists, the mad arms race, the establishment of military bases in Europe and other territories, and the policy of reviving German militarism all prove this.
    Therefore, while striving to expand the front of peaceful construction, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government are also constantly concerned about further strengthening the Soviet Union's defense capabilities. Our air force is developing by leaps and bounds. Socialist industry supplies it with a sufficient number of first-class technology and jet and other aircraft and equipment created according to the latest technology designs of Soviet scientists and designers. Pilots, navigators, engineers, technicians, technicians, and general experts are diligently mastering this technology. The Soviet Air Force has absorbed the combat experience of the Great Patriotic War and has practically mastered the latest military technology. In recent years, the Soviet Air Force has made great progress in its organization, operational-tactical training, and improving combat capabilities.
    Our civil aviation, which is responsible for ensuring the needs of the national economy, has also been greatly developed. Civil aviation routes for passenger and cargo transportation have expanded several times. The routes are equipped with the latest technology and can fly freely regardless of weather conditions, day or night, and spring, summer, autumn, or winter.
    Civil aviation is also integrated into the daily life of our collective farms and state farms, helping them with agricultural work. It has also gained an honorable position in the fishing industry, helping fishermen scout and catch large amounts of fish. Pilots are helping to protect the country's forests from fire and explore for valuable minerals—metals and minerals. Airplanes are being successfully used in more and more sectors of the national economy.
    The All-Union Voluntary Society for Assistance to the Army, Navy and Air Force plays an important role in further consolidating the Soviet Air Force. It is constantly publicizing aviation knowledge to the working people.
    Thanks to the care of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the entire Soviet people, the Soviet Air Force has become the most powerful and advanced air force in the world.
    Soviet pilots are unparalleled flight masters. Of the 224 world records in aviation, gliding, parachuting, and airplane model sports competitions, 69 records, or 30.8 percent, are held by Soviet aviation athletes. Soviet pilots have learned to fly higher, farther, and faster than any aircraft using domestically produced aircraft, and have brought glory to their motherland with this. The Soviet Union is the world's great air power.
    On Air Force Day, Soviet Air Force personnel, aviation industry workers, the countless army of aviation athletes, and the entire Soviet people express their determination: to continue to constantly strengthen the power of their air force, which is vigilantly defending the peaceful and creative labor of the Soviet people.

    苏维埃国家的空军
    苏联空军上将 苏联英雄  叶·普列奥布拉任斯基
    苏联航空节已成为一个伟大的、传统的全民节日。它是检阅苏联航空事业发展的成就的日子，是检阅航空驾驶员和苏联航空工业工作人员的成就的日子。
    苏联共产党和苏联政府不倦地关心着航空事业的建设和发展。因为这样，我们的空军和所有的武装力量一起才能够成为保卫苏联人民和平劳动的坚强支柱。
    俄国是航空事业的祖国，是先进的航空科学的祖国。在这个国家里曾进行了世界上第一次的气球、直升飞机和飞机的飞行，创制了世界上第一个航空发动机。正是俄国的科学家们——罗莫诺索夫、雷卡切夫、菲道洛夫和门德雷也夫创作了深湛的飞行理论基础。创作了许多新的科学—气体力学、瓦斯动力学、超速力动力学、喷气式发动机原理和创制了世界上第一个自动操纵飞行机的俄国科学家们——茹柯夫斯基、齐奥尔科夫斯基和查坡雷金的理论著作，曾对世界航空事业的进一步发展起了巨大的影响。
    俄国的海军工程师亚·弗·莫让依斯基曾经设计了并在一八八二年试验了世界上第一架飞机。
    伟大的俄国科学家门德雷也夫，在一八七五年曾拟制了第一个高空气球的图案，并在一八八七年为了观测日蚀亲自乘着气球上升到离地三千三百五十公尺的高空。至于降落伞，那也是由俄国发明家柯杰里尼柯夫所创制，而世界上第一架水上飞机则是由俄国设计师格里戈洛维奇所发明。
    第一批的航空事业家也是出现在俄国的。这些名家就是莫让依斯基所设计的飞机试验者——飞行家郭卢别夫和高级驾驶术的创始者、著名的俄国飞行家涅斯捷罗夫。
    可是在沙皇俄国的条件下，航空科学不能得到充分的发展。只是在伟大十月社会主义革命胜利以后才出现了真正的繁荣景象。
    在苏联实行社会主义工业化的年代里，强大的冶金、铝、机器制造和其他各工业部门都发展起来了。在这个基础上建立了强大的航空工业。国家有可能建造充分数量的装备精良的头等飞机。苏联的学校曾经培养出许多富有才能的工程师和设计师。
    在反对希特勒德国和帝国主义日本的伟大卫国战争年月里，苏联人民和他的武装力量曾光荣地保卫住了祖国的独立，粉碎了敌军，从而把欧洲和亚洲各族人民从德国法西斯和日本帝国主义的奴役威胁下拯救出来。
    苏联驾驶员们在和敌军战斗中也表现出无比的勇敢精神。他们在莫斯科近郊、斯大林格勒外围一带、在库班以及在希特勒空军不可战胜的神话被彻底粉碎的库尔斯克附近的历次空战中所树立的英勇功绩，是苏联伟大卫国战争史册上的光辉灿烂的篇页。在一九四四年的大反攻作战中，苏联空军曾充分地发挥了自己的威力。
    在战争的最后三年内，苏联的空军驾驶员和高射炮手们总共击落了七万五千架敌机。
    苏联共产党和苏联政府高度地评价了英勇无敌的空军驾驶员的卓越功绩。苏联空军驾驶员有二千一百一十九名被赠予了苏联英雄称号，有六十三名两次荣获了这个崇高称号，并且有两位举世皆知的空军英雄波克雷什金和阔日杜布曾荣获了三次苏联英雄的金星奖章。大批的苏联空军军人被奖给了勋章和奖章。
    在伟大卫国战争终结之后，苏联人民即以极其旺盛的精力担负起恢复和进一步发展国民经济的任务，并获得了巨大成就。苏联的军队和它的空军正警惕地保卫着苏联人民的和平劳动。
    苏联共产党和苏联政府始终一贯地在奉行和平及与一切国家建立善邻关系的政策。由于苏联与中华人民共和国及其他各人民民主国家在密切联系下所进行的争取和平的不懈斗争，在最近以来曾使国际紧张局势有了一些缓和。苏联的和平政策博得了
  一切爱好和平的各族人民对我们祖国的无限信任。
    但是苏联人民是习惯于清醒地来估量情况的。以美国为首的帝国主义的势力是和平的死敌，它们不但不放弃自己的侵略意图，反而在公开地进行反对苏联和各人民民主国家的准备新战争的政策。美帝国主义者的原子弹和氢弹的讹诈、疯狂的军备竞争、在欧洲及其他领土上建立军事基地以及复活德国军国主义的政策都证明着这一点。
    因此，苏联共产党和苏联政府在努力扩大和平建设战线的同时，也对进一步加强苏联国防力量时时刻刻表示着关心。我国的空军在飞跃地发展着。社会主义工业供给它以充分数量的头等技术和根据苏联科学家与设计师的最新技术设计所创制的喷气式和其他的飞机和装备。驾驶员、领航员、工程师、技师、技术员和一般的专家都在孜孜不倦地掌握这种技术。苏联空军吸取了伟大卫国战争的战斗经验并在实践上掌握了最新的军事技术。最近几年，苏联空军在自己的组织、作战——战术的训练以及提高战斗能力等各方面，都有了长足的进步。
    负有保证国民经济需要的我国民航事业也得到了极大的发展。客运和货运的民航航线已扩大了好几倍。航线是由最新的技术装备起来的，无论天气好坏，无论白天黑夜和春夏秋冬，都可自由自在地飞行。
    民航事业和我国集体农庄与国营农场的日常生活也结合起来了，它帮助他们进行农业工作。在渔业方面它也获得了荣誉的地位，帮助着渔民们侦察和打捞大量的鱼类。驾驶员们在帮助防护国家的森林不发生火灾，和勘察有价值的矿产——金属和矿物。在愈来愈多的国民经济各部门中，都正在顺利地使用着飞机。
    全苏陆海空军志愿促进协会对进一步巩固苏联空军方面有着重要的意义。它在不断地对劳动人民广泛宣传航空的知识。
    由于苏联共产党、苏联政府和全体苏联人民的关心，苏联空军已成为世界上最强大、最先进的空军。
    苏联飞行员们是无与伦比的飞行能手。在航空、滑翔、跳伞、飞机模型各种运动竞赛的二百二十四个世界纪录中，有六十九个纪录，也就是百分之三十点八为苏联航空运动员们所占有。苏联飞行员们用国产飞机学会了比任何飞机都飞得更高、更远和更快的飞行，并以此而为祖国增光。苏联是世界上伟大的空军强国。
    在空军节日里，苏联空军人员、航空工业的工作人员、无数的航空运动员大军和全体苏联人民表示着他们的决心：在今后仍将不断地把正警惕地捍卫着苏联人民和平创造性劳动的自己的空军威力加强起来。
