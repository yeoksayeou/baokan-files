    Continue Striving for a Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Question
    Wu Quan
    The Geneva Conference's discussion on the Korean question has been sabotaged by the United States. However, the situation at the final meeting showed the enormous moral power of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal that the relevant countries resume negotiations in the future. It was not only seconded by the Belgian representative and affirmed by the conference chairman Eden, but even the saboteur of the meeting, the US delegation, could only hastily refuse to reach an agreement on this proposal under the pretext of not having consulted the US government.
    The delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union have solemnly stated that their governments and people will continue to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. This effort, with the support of the people of the world, will become an irresistible movement.
    The development of the Korean question proves that the Korean question can only be resolved through negotiation, and any attempt by US imperialism to resolve it by force is doomed to failure. Any pessimism caused by the US's sabotage of the discussion on the Korean question underestimates the powerful popular forces striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, and also underestimates the large-scale international movement striving to ease international tensions.
    The Geneva Conference played a certain role in striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. The significant meaning is that the Geneva Conference has exposed the face of the United States' hostility towards Korean peace and the Korean people's national rights to the people of the world and public opinion, further reducing the international status and international prestige of the United States. At the same time, the just position, the spirit of reconciliation, and the sincere efforts to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, which the delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union consistently adhered to throughout the conference, won the universal sympathy and support of the people of the world and public opinion. The series of proposals put forward by the delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question and the consolidation of Korean peace pointed out the correct path for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. These proposals have been widely and deeply rooted in the hearts of people around the world, forming a powerful force of public opinion, which will have a great influence and role in the future struggle to continue striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question.
    The proposals and propositions of the delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union run through the principle of consolidating Korean peace and realizing the national rights of the Korean people.
    The delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union repeatedly emphasized at the Geneva Conference that although the Korean armistice has eased international tensions to some extent and strengthened peace in the Far East and the world, the armistice in Korea is under increasing threat due to the United States' continuous violation of the armistice agreement, its signing of a "mutual defense treaty" with Syngman Rhee, and its active expansion of Syngman Rhee's army to strengthen its military power in Korea, while the Syngman Rhee government constantly clamors for northward unification of Korea. The state of armistice in Korea is not yet a consolidated peace. The peaceful efforts made by the delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union are aimed at transforming the Korean armistice into a lasting peace.
    On the second day of the Geneva Conference, Foreign Minister Nam Il put forward a constructive plan "on restoring the national unity of Korea and holding free all-Korean elections," advocating that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea simultaneously, that representatives from North and South Korea form an all-Korean commission, that truly democratic elections be held without foreign interference to achieve the unification of Korea, and that the relevant countries guarantee the peaceful development of Korea. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of our country stated from the beginning that our country would assume the obligation to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea, and at the meeting on May 22, he proposed that a neutral international supervisory commission composed of countries that did not participate in the Korean War assist the all-Korean commission in supervising the elections. On June 5, Foreign Minister Molotov, in order to promote an agreement at the conference, put forward five principles, suggesting that the agreements already reached be affirmed and that further consultations be held to resolve the various differences. Obviously, if the Geneva Conference had reached an agreement on these proposals, the unification of Korea would have been possible, and the realization of the unification of Korea would have fundamentally guaranteed lasting peace in Korea. The reason why the US delegation and its lackeys arbitrarily rejected these proposals and obstructed the peaceful unification of Korea is that the peaceful unification of Korea does not conform to its purpose of continuing to divide Korea and undermine the Korean armistice.
    Who wants to consolidate Korean peace and who is deliberately undermining Korean peace is most clearly and prominently reflected in the debate at the last meeting.
    In view of the stubborn obstruction and sabotage by the United States, and estimating that the Geneva Conference could not reach an agreement on the issue of peaceful unification of Korea, the delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union suggested that the conference should reach an agreement on the issue of consolidating Korean peace. Foreign Minister Nam Il suggested that all foreign troops be withdrawn as soon as possible in proportion, that the US-Rhee military treaty be cancelled, that the military forces of North and South Korea be reduced, that economic and cultural relations between North and South Korea be developed to create conditions for mutual rapprochement, and that the countries participating in the conference should guarantee the peaceful development of Korea. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai suggested that China, the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, France, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Republic of Korea discuss relevant measures to consolidate Korean peace. Foreign Minister Molotov suggested that the participating countries issue a declaration guaranteeing that, pending the final resolution of the Korean question, they would not take any action that could threaten the maintenance of peace.
    Except for the enemies of peace, no one can imagine that these proposals of the delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union could be rejected. However, the US delegation and its lackeys even rejected such proposals.
    At the same time, people can clearly see that the proposals and propositions of the delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union also run through such an important principle, that is: affirming that the Korean people have the right to solve their own affairs, the right to obtain their national independence, national unity, and democratic freedom according to their own will, and the right to defend their democratic achievements and promote the peaceful development of their country without foreign interference and oppression. The suggestion made by Foreign Minister Nam Il and supported by China and the Soviet Union on "restoring the national unity of Korea and holding free all-Korean elections" is aimed at letting the Korean people express their wishes and realize their national demands. This is obviously a matter of course for anyone who respects national rights.
    Since the end of World War II, there has been a struggle between two paths in dealing with the Korean question: respecting national rights and disregarding national rights. The Soviet Union insisted on abiding by the resolution of the 1945 Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers on the Korean question, advocating that the Korean question be resolved on the basis of respecting national rights; while the United States, from the very beginning, used the banner of the United Nations in an attempt to make the Korean events develop in the direction that the US government hoped for. The United States acts as the protector of the anti-people Syngman Rhee group, and tries its best to expand the dark rule of this group to North Korea, so as to facilitate the United States' enslavement of the entire Korean people and turn Korea into its own colony and bridgehead for aggression against peaceful and democratic countries. It is in pursuit of this shameful goal that the American interventionists, under the banner of the United Nations, barbarously violated the national independence of Korea and launched and carried out a three-year war of aggression.
    But the failure of the US war of aggression against Korea has not taught it much. The propositions put forward by the US delegation at the Geneva Conference, which sought a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, were so absurd that it vainly attempted to achieve the goals that the United States pursued when launching the war of aggression against Korea. The United States and its followers at the conference unreasonably demanded only the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers, but refused to withdraw US troops; only demanded that the United Nations, which had become a belligerent party, supervise the elections in Korea and interfere in Korea's internal affairs, but opposed genuine free all-Korean elections. If the United States has no military, political, and economic aggressive ambitions towards Korea, then why does it stubbornly refuse to withdraw US troops? If the United States is not hostile to the national rights of the Korean people, is not afraid of the free will of the Korean people, and does not want to impose the reactionary rule of the United States and its Syngman Rhee group on the entire Korean people, then why does it stubbornly oppose holding genuine free all-Korean elections? If the United States does not want to interfere in Korea's internal affairs and does not want to engage in new military adventures, then why is it unwilling to assume the obligation to jointly guarantee peace in Korea with the relevant countries? The so-called "fourteen-point proposal" and "two basic principles" by which the US delegation and its followers sabotaged the Korean issue negotiations are actually imperialist aggression plans and colonialist wishful thinking wrapped in the cloak of diplomatic rhetoric.
    From this, it can be seen that the crux of the failure of the Geneva Conference to reach an agreement on the Korean issue lies in the United States' deliberate sabotage of Korean peace and its desire to deprive the Korean people of their national rights, rule, and enslave the entire Korea; while the delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union resolutely do not allow the United States to realize its arrogant and criminal conspiracy, and insist on consolidating Korean peace and realizing the independence, democracy, and unity of the Korean people. Therefore, the United States' brazen ending of the Geneva Conference's meeting on the Korean issue shows that its conspiracy to achieve at the negotiating table the goals it failed to achieve on the battlefield has been declared a failure. This failure of the United States is inevitable. Its attempt to continue to promote this criminal conspiracy in the future will inevitably be defeated.
    The Korean armistice is not to be undermined, and the United States and its servants absolutely have no power to change the situation in Korea. Any external interference against an awakened and standing-up nation is bound to fail. The heroic Korean people have already proven to the world with their historic victory that they have the determination and strength to defend peace and national rights.
    There is no doubt that the people of all countries in the world will continue to support the Korean people's just struggle to build a peaceful, democratic, independent, and unified Korea. The US ruling group, which has lost all morality on the Korean issue, has sabotaged the Geneva Conference's discussion of the Korean issue, but has not and cannot erase the Korean issue from the international consultation agenda.

### 继续争取朝鲜问题的和平解决

    继续争取朝鲜问题的和平解决
    吴全
    日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论，已被美国所破坏。但在最后一次会议上的情况表明，周恩来外长要求有关国家今后恢复谈判的建议，是具有何等巨大的道义力量，它不仅得到了比利时代表的附议，并为会议主席艾登所肯定，连会议的破坏者美国代表团也只能以未向美国政府请示为借口仓皇拒绝就这个建议达成协议。
    朝、中、苏三国代表团都郑重表示，它们的政府和人民将继续为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决而努力。这个努力，将在全世界人民的支持下，成为不可抗拒的运动。
    朝鲜问题的发展过程证明，朝鲜问题只有用协商的方式才能得到解决，美帝国主义想用武力来解决的任何企图都是要失败的。任何对美国破坏朝鲜问题讨论的结果所引起的悲观情绪，都是对争取和平解决朝鲜问题的强大的人民力量估计不足，也是对争取缓和国际紧张局势的大规模的国际运动估计不足。
    日内瓦会议对于争取和平解决朝鲜问题起了一定的作用。重大的意义是，日内瓦会议已把美国敌视朝鲜和平、敌视朝鲜人民民族权利的面目暴露在世界人民和公众舆论的面前，使美国的国际地位和国际威望更加降低了。同时，朝、中、苏三国代表团在会议上自始至终坚持的正义立场、表现的和解精神和谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的真诚努力，博得了全世界人民和公众舆论的普遍同情和支持。朝、中、苏三国代表团所提出的一系列的和平解决朝鲜问题和巩固朝鲜和平的建议，指出了和平解决朝鲜问题的正确道路。这些建议，已在世界范围内广泛地深入人心，形成了强大的舆论力量，对今后继续争取和平解决朝鲜问题的斗争将起极大的影响和作用。
    朝、中、苏三国代表团的建议和主张贯穿了巩固朝鲜和平、实现朝鲜人民的民族权利的原则。
    朝、中、苏三国代表团在日内瓦会议上一再强调，朝鲜的停战虽然已使国际紧张局势得到了一些缓和，加强了远东和世界的和平；但是，由于美国不断违反停战协定，并和李承晚签订了“共同防御条约”，积极扩充李承晚军队，以加强它在朝鲜的军事力量，同时李承晚政府不断叫嚣北进统一朝鲜，这就使得朝鲜的停战受到日益增长的威胁。朝鲜的停战状态还不是巩固的和平。朝、中、苏三国代表团所进行的和平努力，就是为了使朝鲜的停战得以转入持久的和平。
    日内瓦会议开幕的第二天，南日外务相就提出了“关于恢复朝鲜的国家统一和举行全朝鲜自由选举”的建设性方案，主张一切外国军队同时撤出朝鲜，由南北朝鲜代表组成全朝鲜委员会，在没有外力干涉的情况下举行真正民主的选举，以实现朝鲜的统一，并由有关国家保证朝鲜的和平发展。我国周恩来外长一开始就声明我国将承担保证朝鲜的和平发展的义务，并在五月二十二日的会议上提出由没有参加朝鲜战争的中立国组成国际监察委员会，协助全朝鲜委员会监察选举。莫洛托夫外长曾在六月五日为推动会议达成协议，又提出了五项原则建议，主张肯定已经取得一致的意见，对各项分歧继续协商解决。很显然，如果日内瓦会议就这些建议取得协议，朝鲜的统一就会有实现的可能，而实现朝鲜的统一就能从根本上保证朝鲜的持久和平。美国代表团及其仆从们所以蛮横拒绝这些建议，阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，就是因为朝鲜的和平统一，不符合于它继续分裂朝鲜、破坏朝鲜停战的目的。
    谁要巩固朝鲜的和平，而谁在蓄意破坏朝鲜的和平，最鲜明突出地表现在最后一次会议的争论上。
    朝、中、苏三国代表团鉴于美国死硬地阻挠破坏，估计到日内瓦会议还不能对和平统一朝鲜的问题达成协议，便建议会议应对巩固朝鲜和平的问题达成协议。南日外务相建议按比例尽速撤退一切外国军队，取消美李军事条约，缩减南北朝鲜的军队力量，发展南北朝鲜的经济文化关系以创造相互接近的条件，同时参加会议各国应保证朝鲜的和平发展。周恩来外长建议由中、苏、英、美、法、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国七国讨论巩固朝鲜和平的有关措施。莫洛托夫外长建议与会各国发表宣言，保证在等待朝鲜问题最后解决期间，不得采取任何可能足以对维持和平构成威胁的行动。
    除了和平的敌人，任何人都不能设想朝、中、苏三国代表团的这些建议是可以被拒绝的。但是，美国代表团及其仆从们竟然对这样的建议也加以拒绝了。
    同时，人们可以清楚地看到：朝、中、苏三国代表团的建议和主张，也贯彻着这样一个重要原则，那就是：肯定朝鲜人民有权自己解决自己的事情，有权按照自己的意志获得他们的民族独立、国家统一和民主自由，有权保卫自己的民主果实并在不受外力的干涉和压迫下促进自己国家的和平发展。南日外务相提出并为中苏两国所支持的“关于恢复朝鲜的国家统一和举行全朝鲜自由选举”建议，其目的就是为了让朝鲜人民自己来表达他们的愿望，实现他们的民族要求。这对于任何尊重民族权利的人看来，显然是天经地义的事。
    第二次世界大战结束以来，在对待朝鲜问题上，就一直存在着尊重民族权利和漠视民族权利的两条道路的斗争。苏联坚持遵守一九四五年莫斯科三外长会议对朝鲜问题的决议，主张在尊重民族权利的基础上解决朝鲜问题；而美国则一开始就利用联合国的旗帜，企图使朝鲜的事件按照美国政府所希望的方向发展。美国充当反人民的李承晚集团的保护人，竭力想把这个集团的黑暗统治扩张到北朝鲜，以便于美国奴役全朝鲜的人民，把朝鲜变为自己的殖民地和侵略和平民主国家的桥头堡。就是为了追求这个可耻的目的，美国干涉者打着联合国的旗帜野蛮地侵犯了朝鲜的民族独立，发动和进行了三年的侵略战争。
    但是美国侵朝战争的失败，并没有使它得到多少教训。美国代表团在谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的日内瓦会议上所提出的主张竟荒谬到这样地步，它妄想实现美国在发动侵朝战争时所追求的目标。美国及其追随者在会议上蛮横无理地只要求中国人民志愿军撤退，而不肯撤退美国军队；只要求沦为交战一方的联合国来监督朝鲜的选举，干涉朝鲜内政，而反对进行全朝鲜的真正的自由选举。如果美国对朝鲜并没有军事的、政治的和经济的侵略野心，那末为什么顽固地拒绝撤退美国军队呢？如果美国并不敌视朝鲜人民的民族权利，并不害怕朝鲜人民的自由意志，并不想把美国及其李承晚集团的反动统治强加在全朝鲜人民身上，那末为什么顽固地反对举行全朝鲜的真正的自由选举呢？如果美国并不想干涉朝鲜内政，并不想进行新的军事冒险，那末为什么又不肯负担义务来和有关国家共同保证朝鲜的和平呢？美国代表团及其追随者借以破坏朝鲜问题谈判的所谓“十四点建议”和“两个基本原则”，实际上就是用外交词藻的外衣包裹起来的帝国主义侵略计划和殖民主义者的如意算盘。
    由此可见，日内瓦会议未能就朝鲜问题达成协议的症结所在，是美国蓄意破坏朝鲜的和平，并要剥夺朝鲜人民的民族权利，统治和奴役全朝鲜；而朝、中、苏三国代表团决不容美国实现它的这个狂妄的罪谋，坚持要巩固朝鲜的和平，实现朝鲜人民的独立民主和统一。因此，美国悍然结束日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的会议，说明它想在会议桌上来实现它在战场上未能达到的目的的阴谋，宣告失败了。美国的这个失败是必然的。它企图在今后继续来推行这个罪恶阴谋，也必然还要遭到失败。
    朝鲜停战是不容破坏的，美国及其仆从们决然没有力量来改变朝鲜的局面。对于一个觉醒了的、站起来了的民族，进行任何外来的干涉都是一定要失败的。英勇的朝鲜人民已经用他们的历史性胜利向世界证明，他们是有决心和力量保卫和平与民族权利的。
    毫无疑问，世界各国人民将继续支持朝鲜人民为建立一个和平、民主、独立和统一的朝鲜而进行的正义斗争。在朝鲜问题上丧尽道义的美国统治集团破坏了日内瓦会议对朝鲜问题的讨论，但并没有也不可能把朝鲜问题从国际协商的议程上抹掉。
