    After more than a century of heroic struggle, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, achieved a great victory in the people's revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and established the People's Republic of China, a people's democratic dictatorship. From then on, the people became the masters of the country. This is truly a great and joyous event for us. Today, a draft constitution has been formulated based on the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, guaranteeing that the country can eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means and be built into a prosperous and happy socialist society. Therefore, the draft constitution is a powerful weapon and guarantee for realizing the general task of the country's transition period, and it is a fundamental law that all our people must jointly abide by and implement.
    I firmly support this draft constitution because it will bring more happiness to the people!

    中国人民幸福的保证
    “爱国丰产金星奖章”获得者　李顺达
    中国人民经过了一百多年的英勇奋斗，在共产党的领导下，取得了反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的人民革命的伟大胜利，建立了人民民主专政的中华人民共和国。从此，人民成了国家的主人。这对于我们来说真是一件天大的喜事。今天又以中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领为基础，制定了宪法草案，它保证着国家能够通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困，建设成为一个繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。所以，宪法草案是实现国家过渡时期总任务的有力武器和保证，我们全体人民必须共同遵守和执行的根本法。
    我坚决拥护这个宪法草案，因为它将给人民带来更多的幸福！
