Editor's Note: Twenty-one people spoke before the 30th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on June 14th, when the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" was passed. The speeches of eleven people, including Soong Ching Ling, Li Jishen, Zhang Lan, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Nanxian, Ma Xulun, Ulanhu, He Xiangning, Chen Shutong, and Saifuddin, were published in yesterday's newspaper. The speeches of Fu Zuoyi, Zhang Bojun, Zhu Xuefan, Chen Jiageng, Zhang Zhizhong, Hu Yaobang, Li Siguang, Chen Qiyou, and Xu Deheng are published here today.

Fu Zuoyi's Speech

Let me also talk about my thoughts:

	I. This draft constitution, after the initial draft was submitted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Constitution Drafting Committee, was based on Chairman Mao's instructions. The Constitution Drafting Committee also organized constitution draft symposiums, inviting people from all walks of life in Beijing for nearly twenty discussions. Major regions, provinces, and cities also held several symposiums like Beijing. Later, the drafting committee organized conveners of various groups in Beijing to analyze opinions from all sides, debated them, and wrote a revised draft on May 31st. Finally, the drafting committee wrote the current draft.

	Chairman Mao said at the first meeting of the Constitution Drafting Committee that this initial draft could be slightly revised, greatly revised, or even overturned and a new initial draft written. This shows the modesty of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which tried its best to mobilize everyone to put forward more opinions. In fact, this draft was also the result of modifying the initial draft through extensive discussion, repeated study, and careful consideration. This provided a solemn and democratic foundation for the constitution draft itself.

	At the same time, the entire draft embodies a spirit of "seeking truth from facts." Things that must be written in are written in by all means; things that cannot be done now are definitely not written on paper. This democratic spirit and pragmatic spirit make the constitution draft embody Chairman Mao's style and the Communist Party's style. In recent years, I have seen party cadres all over the country generally doing more and saying less, and never saying what they cannot do. Therefore, the people listen to the Communist Party, and the Communist Party's words are truly "worth a thousand pieces of gold." Therefore, I feel that a constitution written in this spirit must conform to the current situation and must be warmly supported by the people of the whole country.

	II. This constitution draft is based on the Common Program and is also a development of the Common Program. The Common Program was written in 1949. At that time, the country was not completely liberated, and it was written based on Chairman Mao's thought and the Communist Party's revolutionary experience. Over the past few years, in the implementation of the Common Program, our country has achieved brilliant achievements in economic recovery and development, and in various reform movements. On the one hand, it proves the correctness of the Common Program; on the other hand, the political, economic, cultural, and educational situation of our country has also greatly advanced. The people of the whole country have also gained more experience in national construction. This draft constitution is, under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, further summing up these new situations, new achievements, and new experiences. After the draft constitution is promulgated, it will be discussed by the people of the whole country and mastered by the people of the whole country. It will become a law that the people of the whole country will formulate and abide by themselves. It will become a huge force, inspiring us to advance enthusiastically towards a socialist society.

	III. This draft constitution truly realizes the principle of democratic centralism and truly realizes unprecedented thorough unity, the unity of the people.

	In the draft constitution, the people's democratic and free rights are very great. Not only are there the most complete political rights, but also economic rights. Everyone has the right to work, everyone has the right to rest, everyone has the right to education, and working people have the right to receive material assistance from the state after they are old and lose their ability to work. Although under the current conditions in our country, it must be gradually developed to ensure that the people can fully enjoy these rights, it can already be seen that our country is a country owned by the people, and the wealth created by the people will truly be enjoyed by the people. This is a sharp contrast to the capitalist countries' empty talk of "government of the people, by the people, for the people," which is actually governed, owned, and enjoyed by a few capitalists.

	On the other hand, our national organization system reaches a high degree of centralization on the basis of a high degree of democracy. Thus, it completely realizes an unprecedented thorough unity, the unity of the people. This will be of great benefit to the smooth progress of the national economic plan.

	IV. This constitution draft is a constitution for moving towards a socialist society. At the same time, it is a constitution that allows people of all classes to get what they deserve. It provides a favorable guarantee for the socialist future. Articles 4 to 10 and Article 15 of the General Principles are all fundamentally aimed at moving towards a socialist society. However, it also particularly expresses the spirit and method of our country's socialist transformation, peacefully and steadily advancing. Its guarantee of a socialist future satisfies the demands of the basic masses of workers and peasants. Socialist transformation adopts a method of peaceful transition, which gives everyone a bright future. Under this constitution, workers, peasants, youth, the elderly, women, children, and mothers all receive their due rights. Even the bourgeoisie, who will be eliminated during the period of socialist transformation, are legally guaranteed their ownership and inheritance rights of the means of production and other property. On the other hand, it restricts their negative destructive role, gradually transforms them, and enables them to move towards a socialist society. Their children, because they received priority education in the past, have mostly consciously and willingly walked ahead of them. Under internal and external influences, they will also happily find a bright future. This will not delay our country's process of moving towards socialism, but will make it smoother and faster. This is the manifestation of Mao Zedong Thought, the combination of Marxism-Leninism and China's specific conditions. The promulgation of this constitution draft will not only be unanimously supported by the people of the whole country, but will also have a huge impact in the world, especially in Asian countries. This breaks the lie that "socialism is good, the sacrifices in the transition are great, and some people must be eliminated."

	V. This constitution draft, relying on the leadership of the Communist Party, will victoriously complete its mission.

	This constitution draft only mentions the Communist Party in the preamble, but we must not forget that without Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, there would be no People's Republic of China. The leadership of the Party is the soul of all work in our country, the leadership of the Party realizes the leadership of the working class, the leadership of the Party is the only guarantee for consolidating the achievements of the revolution, and the leadership of the Party is the only guarantee for building a socialist society. In recent years, in practical work, I have deeply realized that the leadership of the Party stands among the masses, helps the masses select the correct path, helps the masses eliminate all difficulties, and encourages the masses to move forward bravely. Therefore, although the articles of the constitution draft rarely mention the leadership of the Party, we firmly believe that only by relying on the leadership of the Party can the effectiveness of the constitution be brought into play and the great cause of socialist construction be completed.

	Under this understanding, I feel that although some articles are written with great discretion, for example, the words "gradually" must be added below the rights to work, rest, education, and old-age care, and only concern is mentioned for the youth's intelligence and physical strength. This is not empty talk, but is realistic. Because what cannot be done is not said for the time being, which indicates that it must be done once it is said. Over the years, the leadership of the Communist Party has created the highest credibility of seeking truth from facts in the hearts of the people.

Zhang Bojun's Speech

	The draft constitution of the People's Republic of China was passed and promulgated by the plenary meeting of the Central People's Government Committee today. This is a matter of great historical significance in our country's political life. It marks a new stage in the development of our people's democratic politics. It is an infinite encouragement to the people of the whole country and a huge driving force for national construction. Let us celebrate its birth with unparalleled joy.

	The draft constitution of the People's Republic of China was drafted by the Constitution Drafting Committee based on the initial draft of the constitution proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. From March 23rd to June 11th this year, it took more than eighty days and went through detailed and meticulous research and discussion. During the drafting process, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as the leading organs of major administrative regions, provinces, and cities, various democratic parties, local organizations of people's organizations, and leading organs of the armed forces, organized constitution draft initial draft discussion meetings with more than 8,000 people from all walks of life, and conducted extensive democratic discussions. During the discussion process, more than 5,900 revision opinions were put forward, and some reasonable and applicable opinions were adopted by the Constitution Drafting Committee. After the constitution draft is promulgated, the people of the whole country will launch extensive and in-depth discussions, and then submit it to the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China for discussion and approval, making it our country's first constitution and the fundamental law that the people of the whole country and all state organs jointly abide by and implement during the transition period. This is a real and genuine people's constitution.

	According to Marxist-Leninist constitutional theory, the constitution, as the fundamental law of the state, is the summary of class struggle and the manifestation of the actual relationship of class forces in class struggle. Lenin pointed out in his debate with the Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries who distorted the essence of the constitution: "The essence of the constitution lies in: the fundamental law of general countries and the laws concerning the rights of election of representative organs and the powers of representative organs all express the comparative relationship of actual forces in class struggle." That is to say, the constitution and all laws are the expression of the will of the dictatorial class that has won victory in the class struggle. For example, the bourgeois constitution is the summary of the bourgeoisie's victory in the anti-feudal struggle and its seizure of power. Therefore, what the bourgeois constitution expresses is the will of the bourgeoisie, and the mission of the constitution is to consolidate the social order and ruling power that are conducive to the bourgeoisie's exploitation. The three constitutions of the Soviet Union in 1918, 1924, and 1936 are the summary of the continuous development of the proletariat after the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Therefore, what the three constitutions of the Soviet Union express is the will of the proletariat and other working people, and their mission is to consolidate the social order and ruling power that are conducive to the working masses to eliminate exploitation and build socialist and communist societies. Our current draft people's constitution is the summary of the great victory of the Chinese people under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the great Communist Party of China, after a long period of arduous struggle, finally winning the great victory against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in 1949, establishing a people's democratic regime led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and the new political and economic victories in the past four years. Therefore, what our draft constitution expresses is the will of the people of the whole country, and its glorious mission is to consolidate the social order and ruling power that are conducive to the people of the whole country being able to eliminate exploitation and poverty and build a prosperous and happy socialist society through peaceful means during the transition period.

	As everyone knows, in Chinese history, from the Guangxu Dynasty of the Manchu Qing Dynasty to the reactionary Kuomintang government of Chiang Kai-shek, there have been eleven so-called "constitutions." However, the so-called democratic provisions and civil rights in those "constitutions" were all hypocritical, deceptive, and practically non-existent, and the result must be opposition and abandonment by the people of the whole country. Today, our draft constitution refers to the basic spirit of the Soviet constitution and the constitutions of various people's democratic countries, combines it with the historical characteristics of our country and the current relationship of class comparison, and fixes the great changes in social relations that have emerged since our people's revolution and nation-building. At the same time, it also reflects the fundamental requirements of our country's gradual transition to a socialist society and the common aspirations of the vast number of people to strive to achieve this fundamental requirement. Therefore, this draft constitution is a creative, truly democratic people's constitution draft that conforms to our country's historical conditions and actual needs. The people of the whole country will warmly support its birth and strive for its implementation. This is the reason why our constitution is a truly democratic people's constitution. This is the fundamental difference between our constitution and all bourgeois constitutions and its superiority over all bourgeois constitutions. At the same time, our constitution is a people's constitution suitable for the transition period of China's national conditions. Compared with the current constitutions of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, it has different characteristics, but in fact, it is consistent and belongs to the socialist type.

	According to the preamble of our draft constitution: The broad people's democratic united front formed by the various democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations led by the Communist Party of China will continue to play its role in mobilizing and uniting the people of the whole country to complete the general task of the country's transition period and in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad. In terms of foreign relations, we have established unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, and the friendship with peace-loving people all over the world is also growing day by day. In the future, we will continue to establish and develop diplomatic relations with any country based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. In international affairs, our firm and unwavering policy is to strive for the lofty goals of world peace and human progress. These important provisions will play an extremely important role and impact domestically and internationally. This means that the formulation of our constitution makes the country's people's democratic system more developed, more complete, and more consolidated. The people of the whole country will see the bright future of the country and themselves from our constitution, and will be more united and work hard to participate in the country's economic construction. The peace-loving people of the world will receive great encouragement from our constitution and strengthen the forces for peace and against war. The oppressed people of the world will gain confidence in the victory of the democratic national revolution from our constitution and strengthen the national independence and democratic freedom movement against imperialism. Therefore, our constitution is a sign of China's increasing strength, and it is also a sign of the world's move towards peace and democracy.

	Our draft constitution was produced in accordance with Chairman Mao's wise instructions, summarizing the current actual situation, reflecting the fundamental requirements of the transition period, and through democratic discussion by the people of the whole country. This is unprecedented in Chinese history.

	We thank the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao.

	In the future, the implementation of this constitution will extremely powerfully promote the realization of our country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of the national economy. All our democratic parties and people's organizations should call on all members to warmly support this people's constitution and earnestly abide by this people's constitution. At present, members at all levels should be mobilized to immediately launch a study and publicity campaign on the constitution under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, striving to achieve universal and in-depth understanding by everyone, so that our people's constitution becomes a political weapon for revolutionary nation-building, mobilizing the people of the whole country and all ethnic groups to closely unite around the Communist Party of China, steadily and consciously dedicating their strength to building our country into a great socialist country.

Zhu Xuefan's Speech

	I represent the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to express our full support for the draft constitution proposed by the Constitution Drafting Committee of the People's Republic of China.

	This draft constitution is one of the major fruits of victory won by the Chinese people under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao after a long period of struggle. Because the Communist Party of China led the Chinese people to overthrow the reactionary and dark rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and established the People's Republic of China led by the working class, it is possible to formulate such a draft people's constitution.

	This draft constitution records the actual situation of our country, reflects the great changes in social relations that have occurred since the Chinese people's revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China, and summarizes the main experiences of these changes.

	At present, the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country are struggling to build a new socialist life. The draft constitution also stipulates the fundamental requirement that our country will gradually transition to a socialist society, and points out the correct path for the people of our country to strive to achieve this requirement. We believe that the formulation of the draft constitution will inspire the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and laboring people to build socialism and strive to realize the country's socialist industrialization and gradually transition to a socialist society.

	The broad masses of workers will warmly support this draft constitution and will strive to overfulfill the state production tasks with practical actions.

Chen Jiageng's Speech

	Today, the Central People's Government Committee is discussing the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China." I feel very happy and wholeheartedly support this draft constitution. I believe that after this draft constitution is promulgated, more than 10 million overseas Chinese will be as happy and supportive as I am. Because this constitution is the constitution of the Chinese people, the wish of the people of the whole country for many years, and the eager expectation of overseas Chinese for many years. Of course, individual reactionaries among overseas Chinese will deliberately distort and say that the constitution draft only writes one article about overseas Chinese, which is too little. It is not surprising that they oppose our constitution draft, because they are reactionaries. At the same time, there are also very few people who will say that there are no special provisions for returned overseas Chinese in the draft constitution. This idea and statement are incorrect. This draft constitution was drafted under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, and it was drafted after absorbing people from all walks of life to participate in discussions and research for a long time. Every article and sentence in the draft constitution is solid and there is not a single empty word from beginning to end, and many of the things in it have already been done. Article 98 of the draft constitution says: "The People's Republic of China protects the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese." I think it is very good and enough to have such an article. It would not be possible or necessary to have more. This article in the draft constitution is a great encouragement to overseas Chinese. As for the rights and interests of overseas Chinese who have returned to the country, I think it is not necessary to make special provisions in the constitution, because they have returned home and can already enjoy the rights and obligations stipulated in the draft constitution as the people of the country. They should not ask for other special things.

Zhang Yun's Speech

	I now represent the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to express some thoughts on the passage of the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China by the Central People's Government Committee, and to express our feelings and attitudes here.

	We fully and sincerely support the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China. Because this draft constitution affirms the revolutionary achievements made by the Communist Party of China in leading the people of the whole country in heroic struggle for many years, especially in recent decades; because this draft constitution fully reflects the will and aspirations of the working people of our country, and guarantees that our country will eliminate exploitation and poverty and build a prosperous and happy socialist society and a truly gender-equal society through peaceful means.

	This constitution is a constitution based on socialist principles and with the characteristics of the transition period. Therefore, this constitution is timely, practical, and both necessary and feasible.

	This draft constitution is a draft constitution that everyone is satisfied with, everyone celebrates, and everyone trusts. The reason why it is trusted is because the Chinese people have deeply realized that in the new China where the people are the masters, our laws are not decorations, but the basis for action. We are now waiting for the Central People's Government Committee to pass this draft constitution with joy and excitement. We believe that after this draft constitution is passed by the Central People's Government Committee and submitted to the people of the whole country for discussion, it will definitely be warmly supported by the people of the whole country. Women all over the country will congratulate each other for living in the happy Mao Zedong era, and will congratulate each other for the women's rights being meticulously protected by the constitution. Our All-China Democratic Women's Federation will fully mobilize and organize women all over the country to seriously study this draft constitution in order to deeply understand the essence of this draft constitution and lay the foundation for everyone to abide by the constitution and fight to defend the constitution in the future. In short, we are satisfied and happy with the draft constitution. We want to support it, study it, abide by it, and defend it. This is our feeling and attitude, and this will also be the feeling and attitude of women all over the country.

Zhang Zhizhong's Speech

	Regarding the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China," we studied it and felt that it could be expressed in three sentences: First, the structure is rigorous and clear; second, the content is complete and substantial; third, the wording is simple and clear.

	First of all, the structure of the draft constitution is very rigorous and clear. The content of the draft constitution is complete and substantial, and the sentences and wording are simple and clear. I can just give a few examples.

	For example, the preamble has six paragraphs, and each paragraph is very necessary to write. It is not okay to write less than one paragraph, and there is nothing to write more than one paragraph. In particular, the last sentence of the sixth paragraph: "In international affairs, our country's firm and unwavering policy is to strive for the lofty goals of world peace and human progress." What a loud and powerful call. Imperialist countries spread rumors that: Communist countries are all trying to expand communist aggression. This sentence in our constitution is a powerful counterattack against such rumors and deceptions.

	The first chapter, General Principles, includes Article 2: "All power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people." How powerful. It affirms the nature of our people's democratic country and the people's democratic system. Articles 4 and below 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc. explain that we will build a prosperous and happy socialist society through socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. Article 20 stipulates the nature and tasks of our armed forces. This is a record of the actual situation of our people's army. The Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, under the education of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, have noble qualities and strict discipline. People who visited the volunteers and the People's Liberation Army came back were moved by their high patriotism and internationalism, as well as their strong fighting will, and received a great education. They truly deserve to be called the people's armed forces and the "most beloved people." This article is in line with our actual situation.

	Chapter Two, Section One, National People's Congress. It makes clear and specific provisions on the nature and powers of the National People's Congress, making the National People's Congress a veritable supreme organ of state power.

	Section Three, State Council. Article 47 explains that the State Council is the government of the People's Republic of China. There are now more than 200,000 governments in our country, from the Central People's Government to the township people's governments. After the constitution is passed, local governments will no longer be called governments. China has only one government, which is the State Council. This is a big change. The Government Administration Council has done a lot of work in the past four years and has played a highly effective role. The future State Council will also lead the people of the whole country to move towards a socialist society in a planned and step-by-step manner.

	Section Four, Local People's Congresses and Local People's Committees at All Levels. Written very correctly and appropriately.

	Section Five, Autonomous Organs of National Autonomous Areas. The issue of national autonomy has prominent provisions in the constitution, which shows that we attach importance to the issue of autonomy for ethnic minorities. This will ensure that all ethnic groups in our country will be more united, loving and helping each other, and become a free and equal ethnic family in the future.

	Section Six, Courts and Procuratorial Organs. It stipulates that courts and procurators exercise their powers independently, subject only to the law, and are not subject to interference from other organs, which shows that our judiciary is a people's democratic judiciary that protects the rights of the people.

	Chapter Three, Basic Rights and Obligations of Citizens. This chapter satisfies the wishes of the people of the whole country. Article 85 stipulates: "Citizens of the People's Republic of China are equal before the law." Only the people's democratic regime under the leadership of the Communist Party of China can say this sentence and realize this sentence. Imperialists spread rumors that communist countries control the people and the people have no freedom. Today, our constitution stipulates thirteen freedoms and rights of citizens. It can be said that the Chinese people have true freedom, and the people of imperialist countries truly have no freedom.

	Overall, this draft constitution is: the first constitution in China for thousands of years, the first people's democratic constitution. It not only reflects the achievements of the people's revolution in our country and the new political and economic victories since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, but also reflects the beautiful and happy vision of building a socialist society. It is a new constitution that meets the hopes and requirements of the people of the whole country, consolidates the people's democratic system, and creates a happy life. After this constitution is promulgated, it will definitely be welcomed and supported by the people of the whole country. The people of the whole country will definitely thank the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. Under the great, correct, and wise leadership of Chairman Mao, they have achieved the great victory of the people's revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and can establish the people's democratic dictatorship of the People's Republic of China, and have such a democratic, free, and happy new constitution.

	I think everyone will pass this draft constitution with warm and happy feelings.

Hu Yaobang's Speech

	Our Chinese New Democratic Youth League fully supports the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China that the Central People's Government Committee is about to pass.

	The people of our country have never had a constitution. Old China only had the evil laws of various demons and ghosts. The people of our country have their own fundamental law for the first time. This is the result of the heroic struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. Chinese youth can enjoy this great fruit of victory together with their elders. They not only feel proud and proud, but will also always remember the revolutionary martyrs, and will love our party and our leader Chairman Mao even more.

	The draft constitution also plans a specific path for our country's socialist construction, which arranges a happier world for the people of our country, especially for Chinese youth. Chinese youth cherish the country's special care for them and give them sacred rights and obligations. I dare to believe that Chinese youth will be greatly encouraged by this and will contribute their strength to the country more heroically.

	Our Youth League will launch a upsurge of discussing and studying the draft constitution among the youth of the whole country, and launch an upsurge of fighting for socialism, and greet the first constitution of our country with practical actions.

Li Siguang's Speech

	The constitution that the people of the whole country have long yearned for has recently been unanimously passed in the form of a draft constitution at the Seventh Plenary Meeting of the Constitution Drafting Committee of the People's Republic of China. This draft constitution has extremely solemn and great historical significance. It is a precious fruit of the great victory of the people's revolution and an absolute guarantee for our transition to a happy socialist country. Only under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people drove away imperialism, cleared up the reactionary forces of feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, established the People's Republic of China under the people's democratic dictatorship, and achieved decisive victories in a series of great social reform movements, creating brilliant achievements in the great effort to consolidate national defense and restore and develop the national economy. Only today is it possible for the Chinese people to formulate their own constitution; and today, as our country is advancing rapidly in many aspects at the same time, the establishment of the fundamental law of the state has also become absolutely necessary.

	The initial draft of our constitution was proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Everyone knows that the formulation of this initial draft was by no means an easy task, but was indeed an extremely arduous and meticulous work. The more in-depth we study and research all 97 articles of the draft, the more we can appreciate the basic spirit and logical composition of this document. It not only carefully plans the state organs, correctly affirms the basic rights and obligations of citizens, but also embodies the vivid form of our thriving society. With this basic document, we have pointers and norms for systematically studying and discussing the constitution. Its leading role in this constitutional study and research work is immeasurable.

	Since the Constitution Drafting Committee distributed the initial draft of the constitution more than two months ago, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the central and local administrative leading organs, the democratic parties, the people's organizations, and the leading organs of the armed forces have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Central Committee, and launched organized and systematic study and discussions. According to preliminary statistics, the number of people participating in the study and discussions reached more than 8,000, accumulating 2.3 million words of opinion records. Among them, there were questions, developments, attempts to supplement, attempts to summarize, and suggestions for revising words and rhetoric to the articles of the initial draft. From any perspective, the opinions put forward are extremely sincere, extremely serious, and also express all feelings and intentions without any restraint. No matter which aspect the different opinions belong to, their basic spirit and the essence of the content they emphasize are almost entirely consistent.

	What do these facts illustrate? They indisputably illustrate that in the process of this constitutional study and discussion, we have truly implemented the spirit of democratic centralism implemented in the draft constitution. On the one hand, we have tried our best to give full play to the power of the collective wisdom of the people's democracy, and at the same time, we have more deeply realized the wisdom and greatness of the leadership.

	Recently, the Constitution Drafting Committee has gathered the essence of this large pile of opinions and integrated them with the initial draft of the constitution, and finally formulated this draft constitution consisting of a preamble and 106 articles. Therefore, we can proudly say that this draft constitution is a 100% people's democratic constitution, and we can proudly say that the superiority of our people's democratic system is inseparable from the wise leadership of our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao at all times.

	In the initial draft of the constitution and the collection of a large number of opinions related to the constitution, we can see that in the process of this constitution-making, we have obtained the convenience of referring to the constitutions of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. But today, we can also see that the final draft constitution also strongly reflects the excellent traditions of our long-standing Chinese culture in some aspects. This characteristic cannot be ignored.

	More importantly, the basic principle of formulating this draft constitution is not only to address the current reality or focus on long-term plans, but also to carefully take into account the situation of our country's step-by-step progress. Because it views all national facilities and plans from the point of view of development, it is not like the constitutions of capitalist countries, which are full of impractical and rigid articles, but has a high degree of flexibility, that is, a high degree of scientificity. In the process of our country marching towards socialism, it can adapt to the changes in the proportion of economic components and the social system, and it can also play a role in promoting and regulating these aspects. There is no doubt that this solemn and flexible national canon is the absolute guarantee for the realization of our general line and the completion of the general task. Therefore, I am willing to express my unconditional support for this draft constitution; I believe that our national scientific workers will definitely find more reasons to agree with the opinion I have put forward.

Chen Qiyou's Speech

	I wholeheartedly support the soon-to-be-promulgated draft constitution of the People's Republic of China, and at the same time extend my warmest congratulations to this unprecedented event.

	China used to have various so-called constitutions, but those so-called constitutions were all things to deceive the people and anesthetize the people, and had nothing to do with the interests of the Chinese people. Only the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China, which is about to be promulgated, truly meets the requirements of the people of the whole country.

	Due to the completion of the new democratic revolution, our country is in the process of gradually transitioning to a socialist society under the leadership of the working class. Our draft constitution fully demonstrates this characteristic. It is of the same socialist type as the constitutions of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, although it is not exactly the same in form. The people of the whole of China will all feel happy and proud to have this constitution.

	The promulgation of this draft constitution is the result of the struggle of the Chinese people for more than a hundred years, but this fruit of victory is inseparable from the wise leadership and heroic struggle of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. We especially want to express our sincere thanks and high respect to the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, who led the Chinese people to win the revolution and thus made the promulgation of this draft constitution a reality.

	The initial draft of this constitution was proposed by Chairman Mao on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and was discussed by the central and local organs for several months. Now it is going to be promulgated nationwide so that the broad masses of people have ample opportunity to discuss it. Undoubtedly, it will become a very perfect constitution. I, on behalf of all the comrades of the China Zhi Gong Party and the overseas Chinese masses with whom they are associated, fully agree with this draft constitution, and am willing to see the National People's Congress formally approve it as soon as possible, and am even more determined to strive to achieve all the great goals it contains.

Xu Deheng's Speech

	I participated in this meeting of the Central People's Government Committee with infinite excitement. I, on behalf of the Jiu San Society, warmly support the draft constitution. This draft constitution was accumulated by the blood of our martyrs for many years. Thanks to the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, we overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China more than four years ago, we have achieved great achievements on all fronts. We have summarized these achievements, and then we have this draft constitution. Now, when discussing the draft constitution, we not only warmly support this draft constitution, but also sincerely thank Chairman Mao and the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China. This draft constitution embodies the requirements of the people of the whole country and embodies the high interests of the people of the whole country, so this constitution is the constitution of the people. For decades, China has also had some so-called "constitutions" that are neither fish nor fowl, from the "Nineteen Articles" of the Manchu Qing Dynasty to the "constitution" of the Kuomintang. These are all constitutions that deceive and oppress the people, and oppress the majority of people for the interests of a small group of people. Our draft constitution truly represents the people, is for the people, and realizes the interests of the people.

	I personally had the honor of participating in the draft constitution symposium. In the symposium, everyone did "know everything and say everything" and enthusiastically put forward opinions. The leading party was "modest and eager to learn," and adopted all opinions that could be adopted. This democratic spirit runs through every article of the draft constitution. Each of us should learn this democratic spirit and learn Chairman Mao's pragmatic democratic spirit and democratic style.

	After this draft constitution is promulgated, it will definitely have a great impact on the world. On the one hand, the People's Republic of China with a population of more than 500 million has summarized the experience of revolution and construction and written this constitution. The people of the world will definitely be jubilant, which will strengthen the forces of the peace and democracy camp. On the other hand, imperialism has always been hostile to us, and they are doing everything possible to obstruct and sabotage us

    拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案
    编者按：在六月十四日中央人民政府委员会第三十次会议通过“中华人民共和国宪法草案”前发言的有二十一人。其中宋庆龄、李济深、张澜、黄炎培、张难先、马叙伦、乌兰夫、何香凝、陈叔通、赛福鼎、程潜等十一人的发言已在昨日本报发表，现将傅作义、章伯钧、朱学范、陈嘉庚、章蕴、张治中、胡耀邦、李四光、陈其尤、许德珩等十人的发言继续发表在这里。
    傅作义的发言
    让我也谈一谈我的感想：
    一、这个宪法草案，在中共中央提出初稿交给宪法起草委员会以后，依据毛主席的指示，宪法起草委员会又组织了宪草座谈会，在北京就邀集了各方面的人士，座谈近二十次。各大区各省市也和北京一样，同样座谈了若干次。以后由起草委员会组织北京各小组召集人，将各方面的意见作了分析，经过辩论，写成五月三十一日修正稿。最后又由起草委员会写成现在的草案。
    毛主席在第一次宪法起草委员会上说，这个初稿可以小修改，可以大修改，也可推翻这个初稿，另写一个初稿。可见中共中央虚怀若谷，尽量发动大家多提意见，事实上这个草案，也是在广泛讨论、反复研究、字斟句酌的情况下将初稿修改而成的。这样就给宪草本身提供了一个郑重的、民主的基础。
    同时，草案的全文，贯穿着一种“实事求是”的精神。必须写进去的东西，想尽方法写进去；而现在办不到的事情，一定不肯写在纸上。这种民主的精神、实事求是的精神，使宪法草案，贯穿了毛主席的作风，共产党的作风。几年来我在全国各地看见党的干部，一般是做得多，说得少，办不到的决不说，所以人民群众听共产党的话，共产党的话真如“一字千金”。所以我觉得用这样的精神写成的宪法，一定符合目前的情况，一定得到全国人民的热烈的拥护。
    二、这个宪法草案，以共同纲领为基础，又是共同纲领的发展。共同纲领是在一九四九年写成的。那时候全国尚未完全解放，是根据毛主席的思想和共产党革命经验写成的。几年来执行共同纲领，我国在经济恢复和发展中，在各种改革运动中，已经取得了辉煌的成就。一方面证明了共同纲领的正确性，另一方面，我们国家的政治、经济、文化、教育情况，也已经大大地向前推进了一步。全国人民在国家建设方面也有了更多的经验。这个宪法草案，正是在毛主席思想的领导下，进一步总结了这些新的情况，新的成就和新的经验。宪草公布以后，经过全国人民的讨论，为全国人民所掌握，它将成为全国人民自己订定、自己遵守的法规，它将成为一个巨大的力量，鼓舞我们向社会主义社会踊跃前进。
    三、这个宪法草案真正实现了民主集中的原则，真正实现了从未有过的彻底统一，人民的统
  一。
    在宪法草案中，人民的民主自由权利是很大的。不但有最完备的政治权利，而且有经济的权利。人人有劳动权，人人有休息权，人人有受教育权，劳动人民在年老失去工作能力以后，有接受国家物质帮助的权利。虽然在我国现有的条件下，还必须逐步发展，才能保证人民能完全享受这些权利，但这已经可以看出，我们的国家是人民所有的国家，人民创造的财富，将真正为人民所享受。对于资本主义国家空谈“民治、民有、民享”，实际为少数资本家所治、所有、所享，是一个尖锐的对照。
      另一方面，我们的国家组织系统，是在高度民
  主基础上，达到高度集中。因而完全实现了前所未有的彻底统一，人民的统一。这对于国民经济计划的顺利进行，将有极大的裨益。
    四、这个宪草是走向社会主义社会的宪草。同时是使各阶层人民各得其所的宪草。它对社会主义前途，提供了有利的保证。总纲第四条到第十条以及第十五条，基本精神都是走向社会主义社会。但也特别表现了我国社会主义改造、和平地稳步地前进的精神和方法。它保证了社会主义前途，就满足了工农基本群众的要求。社会主义改造，采用了和平过渡的方法，就使人人都有光明前途。在这个宪法下，工人、农民、青年、老年、妇女、儿童、母亲都得到了他们应有的权利。甚至对于在社会主义改造时期将要被消灭的资产阶级，也依法保障他们的生产资料和其他财产所有权与继承权。另一方面却限制他们消极的破坏作用，逐步改造，使他们也走向社会主义社会。他们的子女由于过去优先受了教育，多数已自觉自愿地走在他们的前头。他们在内外的影响下，也会愉快地找到光明的前途的。这样，并不会迟延我国走向社会主义的过程，反而会使它更顺利更迅速。这是毛主席思想的表现，这是马克思列宁主义和中国具体情况的结合。这个宪草的公布，不但会得到全国人民一致的拥护，而且在世界上特别在亚洲国家中将会发生巨大的影响。这可打破了“社会主义是好的，过渡中牺牲是大的，而且某些人一定要消灭的”谎言。
    五、这个宪草，依靠共产党的领导，将胜利地完成它的使命。
    这个宪草，只有在序言中提到共产党，但我们不能忘记，没有毛主席和共产党，就没有中华人民共和国。党的领导是我国一切工作的灵魂，党的领导实现着工人阶级的领导，党的领导是巩固革命成果的唯一保障，党的领导是建成社会主义社会的唯
  一保证。几年来在实际工作中，我深深体会到党的领导是站在群众中，帮助群众选定正确的道路，帮助群众排除一切困难，鼓舞群众勇往前进。所以在宪法草案条文中，虽然很少提起党的领导，但是我们深信，只有依靠党的领导，才能发挥宪法的效用，才能完成社会主义的建设伟业。
    在这样理解下，我觉得，有些条文虽然写得很有分寸，比如说，对劳动权、休息权、受教育权、养老权等下面必须加上“逐步”字样，对青年的智力体力，只能说是关怀。这并不是空洞，反而倒是切实。因为做不到的暂时不说，正表示说出来一定要做到。多年来共产党的领导，在人民群众心里已经造成了这种实事求是的最高信誉。
    章伯钧的发言
    中华人民共和国宪法草案今天经过中央人民政府委员会全体会议通过公布，这在我们国家政治生活中，是一件具有伟大历史意义的事情，这标志着我国人民民主政治发展的新阶段，对全国人民来说，是一种无限的鼓舞，对国家建设来说，是一个巨大的推动力量。让我们以无比的欢欣来庆祝它的诞生。
    中华人民共和国宪法草案，是由宪法起草委员会根据中国共产党中央委员会提出的宪法草案初稿进行起草的。从今年三月二十三日起到六月十一日止，历时八十余日，经过详细而又周密的研究和商讨，在起草工作进行期间，复经由中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会以及各大行政区、各省市的领导机关，各民主党派，各人民团体的地方组织和武装部队的领导机关，组织了包罗各方面八千余人的宪法草案初稿讨论会，进行了广泛的民主讨论，在讨论过程中，提出修正的意见有五千九百余条之多，其中有些合理合用的意见，都经由宪法起草委员会予以采纳。在宪草公布之后，更将由全国人民展开广泛深入的讨论，然后提交中华人民共和国第一届第一次全国人民代表大会讨论通过，成为我国的第
  一个宪法，成为全国人民和一切国家机关在国家过渡时期所共同遵守和实行的根本法。这才是真正的名副其实的人民宪法。
    依据马克思列宁主义的宪法学说，作为国家根本法的宪法，是阶级斗争的总结，是阶级斗争中阶级力量实际对比关系的表现。列宁在和俄国社会革命党人歪曲宪法本质论战时指出：“宪法的本质就在于：一般国家的根本法以及有关选举代议机关的权利和代议机关的权限等方面的法律，都是表现阶级斗争中实际力量的对比关系的。”这就是说宪法和所有的法律，都是在阶级斗争中取得胜利的专政阶级的意志的表现。比如资产阶级的宪法，就是资产阶级在反封建斗争中取得胜利和掌握政权的总结，所以资产阶级宪法所表现的就是资产阶级的意志，宪法的使命就在巩固有利于资产阶级从事剥削的社会秩序和统治力量。苏联的一九一八年、一九二四年和一九三六年的三个宪法，就是无产阶级在伟大的十月社会主义革命取得胜利建立了无产阶级专政以后的不断发展的总结，所以苏联的三个宪法所表现的就是无产阶级及其他劳动人民的意志，它们的使命就在于巩固有利于劳动群众消灭剥削和建设社会主义及共产主义社会的社会秩序和统治力量。我们现在这个人民宪法草案，是中国人民在英明的毛主席和伟大的中国共产党领导下，经过了长时期的艰苦奋斗，终于在一九四九年取得了反对帝国主义、反对封建主义和反对官僚资本主义的伟大胜利，建立了工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主政权和四年来政治上和经济上的新胜利的总结，所以我们这个宪法草案所表现的就是全国人民的意志，它的光辉的使命就在于巩固有利于全国人民在过渡时期能够通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会的社会秩序和统治力量。
    大家知道，中国历史上从满清光绪王朝到蒋介石反动国民党政府时止，曾有过十一次的所谓“宪法”。但是那些“宪法”中所谓民主条文和公民权利，都是虚伪的、骗人的、实际上不存在的，结果就必为全国人民所反对，所唾弃。今天我们这个宪法草案，是参考了苏联宪法和各人民民主国家的宪法的基本精神，结合着我国历史特点和当前的阶级对比关系，把我们人民革命和建国以来所出现的社会关系的伟大变革的成果，固定下来。同时，更反映了我们国家逐步过渡到社会主义社会的根本要求和广大人民为着实现这个根本要求而奋斗的共同愿望。因此，这个宪法草案是一个创造性的、合乎我国历史条件和实际需要的真正民主的人民宪法草案，全国人民必将为它的诞生而热烈拥护，必将为它的实行而努力奋斗。
    根据我们宪法草案的序言：这个宪法以一九四九年的中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领为基础，同时又是共同纲领的发展。所以这个宪法草案所记载的，不仅是当前过渡时期实际生活中所存在的东西，不仅是广大人民在长期革命斗争中所争得的东西，而且在现有的基础上，确立了国家发展的方针和奋斗的目标。比如在社会结构方面，规定国家保护现存的各种所有制，同时规定全民所有制的国营经济是整个国民经济中的领导力量和实现社会
  主义改造的物质基础，并规定通过合作的道路，逐步改变个体农业和个体手工业的私人所有制为社会
  主义的集体所有制，对富农经济采取限制和逐步消灭的政策，对私营工商业，则指导它们转变为不同形式的国家资本主义经济，逐步以全民所有制代替资本家所有制。在政治制度方面，采用人民代表大会制，以全国人民代表大会为最高国家权力机关，同时又为行使国家立法权的唯一机关，实现立法权与行政权的统一。实行民主集中制，使人民代表由选民产生，并受选民监督，贯彻少数服从多数，个人服从整体，下级服从上级。在国家行政方面，则规定：中华人民共和国国务院即中华人民共和国政府，是最高国家权力机关的执行机关，是最高国家行政机关，地方各级人民代表大会都是地方国家权力机关，地方各级人民委员会都是地方各级人民代表大会的执行机关，又都是地方国家行政机关。像这种国家组织系统的创立是依据马克思列宁的国家学说对于中国近代国家组织机构进行了一个彻底的革新工作。在我们统一的多民族的国家内，各民族有平等的权利和义务，在宪法和法律规定的权限内，实行少数民族的区域自治，以发扬各民族的友爱、互助、合作的精神，这是把斯大林的民族理论，根据中国的实际情况，而予以具体实行。至于公民的基本权利方面，又规定了每一个公民有言论、出版、集会、结社、游行、示威的自由；有宗教信仰的自由；有进行科学研究、文学艺术创作及其他文化活
  动的自由。并规定了逐步扩大物质措施，以为每一个公民享受自由和权利的保证。解放了的中国人民在自己当家作主的国家内，对于把革命胜利的果实固定下来的宪法，必将以无比的热情和力量来拥护和实行的。这就是我们这个宪法之所以为真正民主的人民宪法的原因，这就是我们这个宪法根本区别于一切资产阶级的宪法，优越于一切资产阶级宪法的地方。同时我们这个宪法是适合中国国家情况的过渡时期的人民宪法，比起苏联以及各人民民主国家的现行的宪法，是具有不同的特点，但实际上是一致的，是同属于社会主义类型的。
    根据我们宪法草案的序言：以中国共产党为领导的各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体所结成的广泛的人民民主统一战线，今后在动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中，将继续发挥它的作用。在对外关系方面，我们已经同苏联和各人民民主国家建立了牢不可破的友谊，同全世界爱好和平的人民的友谊也日见增进，今后将继续根据平等、互利、互相尊重领土主权的原则同任何国家建立和发展外交关系。在国际事务中，我国坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。这些重要的规定，将在国内和国际方面起着极其重大的作用和影响。这就是说，我们这个宪法的制定，使国家的人民民主制度更加发展，更加完备，更加巩固，全国人民将从我们的宪法看到国家和自己的光明前途，而更加团结努力参加国家经济建设工作。世界爱好和平的人民将从我们的宪法获得莫大的鼓舞，而加强争取和平反对战争的力量。世界被压迫的人民将从我们的宪法中获得民主民族革命胜利的信心，而加强反对帝国主义的民族独立和民主自由运动。因此，我们这个宪法就是我们中国日益强盛的标志，也就是全世界走向和平民主的标志。
    我们这个宪法草案是遵照毛主席英明的指示，总结当前的实际情况，反映过渡时期的根本要求，通过全国人民的民主讨论而产生出来的。这是中国历史上所未有的事。
    我们感谢中国共产党，感谢毛主席。
    今后，这个宪法的实行，将极其有力地推进我们国家的社会主义工业化和国民经济的社会主义改造的实现。我们所有民主党派和人民团体应号召全体成员热烈拥护这个人民宪法，切实遵行这个人民宪法。目前应动员各级成员在中国共产党领导下，立即展开关于宪法的学习和宣传工作，务期做到普遍深入，人人了解，使我们这个人民宪法成为革命建国的政治武器，动员全国人民及全国各民族紧密团结在中国共产党的周围，稳步地、自觉地献出自己的力量，为建设我国成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
    朱学范的发言
    我代表中华全国总工会表示完全拥护中华人民共和国宪法起草委员会所提出的宪法草案。
    这个宪法草案是中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下经过了长期奋斗所获得的重大的胜利果实之一，由于中国共产党领导中国人民推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动黑暗统治，建立了以工人阶级为领导的中华人民共和国，才有可能制订这样一个人民的宪法草案。
    这个宪法草案记录了我们国家现在的实际情况，反映了我国人民革命和中华人民共和国成立以来所出现的社会关系的伟大变革，总结了这些变革的主要经验。
    目前中国工人阶级和全国人民正为建设社会主义的新生活而奋斗，宪法草案也规定了我国将逐步过渡到社会主义社会这一根本要求，并指出了我国人民为着实现这个要求而奋斗的正确的道路。我们相信由于宪法草案的制定，将鼓舞广大职工群众和劳动人民建设社会主义的热情，为实现国家的社会主义工业化及逐步过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗。
    广大的职工群众将热烈地拥护这个宪法草案，并将以实际行动为超额完成国家生产任务而努力。
    陈嘉庚的发言
    今天，中央人民政府委员会讨论“中华人民共和国宪法草案”，我感到非常愉快，并衷心拥护这个宪法草案。我相信：这个宪法草案公布以后，在国外的一千多万华侨也会同我一样地高兴和拥护的。因为这个宪法是我国人民的宪法，是全国人民多年来的愿望，是海外华侨多年来热切殷望的宪法。当然，华侨中的个别反动分子会故意歪曲说：宪草中关于国外华侨只写了一条，写的太少了。他们反对我们的宪草是不奇怪的，因为他们是反动分子。同时，也有极少数的人也会说：宪法草案中对于归国华侨没有什么特殊规定。这种想法和说法是不对的。这个宪法草案是在毛主席亲自领导下起草的，是吸收各方面人士参加经过长时期地讨论和研究的。宪法草案的每一条每一句都是实实在在的，从头到尾没有一句空话，而且其中有许多事情是已经做了的。宪法草案第九十八条说：“中华人民共和国保护国外华侨的正当的权利和利益。”我看有这么一条就很好，就够了，再多了不是做不到，就是不必要。宪法草案中有这么一条，对于国外华侨就是很大的鼓舞。至于对已归国的华侨的权利和利益，我看在宪法中不必作特别规定，因为他们已回到家里来了，已经可以同国内人民一样地享受宪法草案所规定的权利和义务了，不应再要求其他特殊的东西。
    章蕴的发言
    我现在代表中华全国民主妇女联合会对中央人民政府委员会通过中华人民共和国宪法草案，发表一点感想，并在这里表示我们的心情和态度。
    我们对中华人民共和国宪法草案，完全衷心拥护。因为这个宪法草案，肯定了多少年来特别是几十年来中国共产党领导全国人民英勇奋斗所取得的革命成果；因为这个宪法草案充分反映了我国劳动人民的意志和愿望，保证了我国通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会、真正男女平等的社会。
    这个宪法，是基于社会主义原则又具有过渡时期特点的宪法。因此这个宪法是适时的、切实的、是必行而又可行的。
    这个宪法草案是人人满意、人人称庆的宪法草案，又是人人信任的宪法草案。它之所以被人信任，因为中国人民已经深深体会到，在人民作了主人的新中国，我们的法律不是装璜，而是行动的依据。我们此刻正是以欢欣鼓舞的心情等待中央人民政府委员会通过这个宪法草案。我们相信这个宪法草案在中央人民政府委员会通过后，交给全国人民讨论时，必将获得全国人民的热烈拥护。全国妇女将以自己生活在幸福的毛泽东时代而相互庆贺，将以妇女的权利得到宪法的无微不至的保护而相互庆贺。我们全国民主妇联将以全力发动和组织全国妇女认真学习这个宪法草案，以求深切理解这个宪法草案的精义，打下将来大家遵守宪法并为保卫宪法而斗争的基础。总之，对宪法草案，我们是满意的、高兴的，我们要拥护它、学习它、遵守它、保卫它。这就是我们的心情和态度，这也将是全国妇女的心情和态度。张治中的发言
    对于“中华人民共和国宪法草案”，我们研究了一下，觉得可以用三句话来表示：第一，结构谨严而明确；第二，内容完整而充实；第三，措词简易而明确。
    首先，关于宪法草案的结构非常谨严、非常明确，宪法草案的内容的完整充实，以及造句措词的简易明确，可随便举几个例子说一下。
    比如序言，有六段，每一段都是非常必要写的，少写一段不行，多写一段也没有什么可写。其中特别是第六段最后一句：“在国际事务中，我国坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。”这是多么响亮、多么有力的号召。帝国主义国家造谣说：共产党国家都是要扩大共产主义的侵略的。我们宪法上这一句话，对这种造谣和欺骗，是一个有力的反击。
    第一章总纲，其中第二条：“中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。”多么有力量，它肯定了我国的人民民主国家的性质和人民民主制度。第四条以及以下第六、七、八、九、十等条，说明我们通过社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，最后建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。第二十条，规定了我国的武装力量的性质和任务。这是我国人民军队的实际情况的记录。中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军，在毛主席和中国共产党的教育下，具有高尚的品质和严格的纪律，慰问志愿军和解放军的人回来都为他们的高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神，以及他们的坚强的战斗意志而感动，而受到很大的教育。他们真正不愧为人民的武装力量，不愧为“最可爱的人”。这一条是符合我们的实际情况的。
    第二章第一节，全国人民代表大会。其中对全国人民代表大会的性质、职权作了明确而具体的规定，使全国人民代表大会成为名副其实的最高国家权力机关。
    第三节，国务院。第四十七条说明了国务院即是中华人民共和国政府。现在我国内从中央人民政府到乡人民政府全国有二十几万个政府，从宪法通过以后，地方就不叫政府了，中国只有一个政府即国务院，这是一个很大的改变。今天的政务院在四年来做了很多工作，发挥高度的效能，今后的国务院也必将领导全国人民有计划有步骤地走向社会主义社会。
    第四节，地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会。写得很正确，适当。
    第五节，民族自治地方的自治机关。民族自治问题，在宪法中有很突出的规定，这表明我们重视少数民族的自治问题。这将保证我国各民族今后将更加团结，友爱互助，成为一个自由平等的民族大家庭。
    第六节，法院和检察机关。其中规定了法院和检察长均独立行使职权，只服从法律，不受其他机关的干涉，这说明我国的司法是人民民主的司法，是保障人民的权利的。
    第三章，公民的基本权利和义务。这一章满足了全国人民的愿望。第八十五条规定：“中华人民共和国公民在法律上一律平等。”只有在中国共产党领导下的人民民主政权，才能讲这句话，才能实现这句话。帝国主义者造谣说，共产党国家在控制人民，人民没有自由，今天我们的宪法规定了十三条公民的自由和权利。可以说，中国人民才有真正的自由，帝国主义国家的人民才真正没有自由。
    总起来说，这个宪法草案是：中国几千年来第
  一部宪法，第一部人民民主的宪法，它是不仅反映了我国人民革命的成果和中华人民共和国建立以来政治上、经济上的新胜利，并且反映了建设社会主义社会的美好幸福的远景的宪法，它是符合全国人民的希望和要求的巩固人民民主制度、创造幸福生活的新宪法。这个宪法公布以后，一定为全国人民所欢迎所拥护，全国人民一定感谢中国共产党、感谢毛主席，在毛主席的伟大、正确、英明的领导之下，取得了反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的人民革命的伟大胜利，才能建立人民民主专政的中华人民共和国，才有这样一部民主的、自由幸福的新宪法。
    我想，大家一定会以热烈、愉快的心情来通过这个宪法草案。
    胡耀邦的发言
    我们中国新民主主义青年团完全拥护这次中央人民政府委员会即将通过的中华人民共和国宪法草案。
    我国人民从来没有宪法，旧中国只有各种妖魔鬼怪的妖法。我国人民第一次有了自己祖国的根本大法，这是伟大的中国共产党和毛主席领导中国人民英勇奋斗的结果。中国青年能够和长辈一道，享受到这个伟大的胜利果实，不仅感到骄傲，感到自豪，而且将永远怀念革命的先烈，将更加热爱我们的党，热爱我们的领袖毛主席。
    宪法草案又为我国社会主义建设规划了具体道路，这就为我国人民，首先是为中国青年安排了一个更加幸福的天地。中国青年非常珍贵祖国对他们的特别关怀，给予了他们神圣的权利和义务。我敢相信，中国青年将因此受到极大的鼓舞，必将更英勇地为祖国贡献自己的力量。
    我们青年团将在全国青年中掀起一个讨论和学习宪法草案的热潮，掀起一个为社会主义而斗争的热潮，用实际行动迎接我们祖国的第一个宪法。
    李四光的发言
    全国人民长时期以来所渴望的宪法，最近已经在中华人民共和国宪法起草委员会第七次全体会议上，以宪法草案的形式一致通过了。这一宪法草案，是具有极其庄严而伟大的历史意义的。它是人民革命伟大胜利的珍贵果实，也是我们过渡到美满的社会主义国家的绝对保证。只有在中国共产党和毛主席英明领导下，中国人民，赶走了帝国主义，肃清了封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动势力，建立了人民民主专政的中华人民共和国，并且在一系列的伟大社会改革运动中，取得了决定性的胜利，在巩固国防与恢复和发展国民经济的巨大努力中，创造了辉煌成就的今天，中国人民制订自己的宪法，才能成为可能；而在我们的国家以突飞猛进的趋势，向多方面同时进展的今天，国家根本大法的确立，也成为绝对的必要。
    我们的宪法草案初稿，是由中国共产党中央委员会提出的。大家都知道，这一初稿的制订，决不是轻而易举的事，而着实是一项极其繁重而又缜密的工作。对全稿九十七条，我们愈作深入的学习和研究，愈能体会到这一文件的基本精神和组成的逻辑。它不独周密地规划了国家机构，正确地肯定了公民的基本权利和义务，而且同时也体现了我们欣欣向荣的社会的生动形态。有了这一基本的文件，我们对宪法作有系统的研究和讨论，才有了指针和规范。它在这一次宪法的学习和研究工作中所起的领导作用，是无可计量的。
    自从宪法起草委员会在两个多月以前，把宪法草案初稿分发了以后，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会、全国各中央及地方行政领导机关、各民主党派、各人民团体以及武装部队的领导机关，都热烈地响应了中央的号召，发动了有组织、有系统的学习和讨论，据初步的统计，参加学习和讨论的人数，达到了八千多人，累积了二百三十万字的意见记录。其中对初稿的条文，有质疑、有发挥、有试作补充、有试作归纳、也有若干修改文字和修辞的建议。无论从哪一方面看，这些意见的提出，都是极其诚恳的，极其严肃的，也是尽情尽意，毫无拘束的。无论不同意见属于哪一方面，它们的基本精神和它们所强调的内容的实质，几乎是全部一致的。
    这些事实说明了什么？它们无可争辩地说明了，在这一次宪法的研究和讨论的过程中，我们确确实实地贯彻了贯彻在宪法草案中的民主集中精神。我们一方面，尽量地发挥了人民民主的集体智慧的力量，而同时也更深刻地认识到领导方面的贤明和伟大。
    最近宪法起草委员会汇集了这一大堆意见的精华，把它们和宪法草案初稿融合在一起，最后才制订了由一篇序言和一百零六条条文构成的这一宪法草案。因此，我们可以骄傲地说，这一部宪法草案是百分之百的人民民主宪法，我们更可以骄傲地说，我们的人民民主制度的优越性，是时时刻刻和我们的党中央和毛主席的英明领导分不开的。
    在宪法草案初稿和有关宪草的大量意见汇集中，我们可以看出，在这一次制宪的过程中，得到了参考苏联和其他人民民主国家的宪法的便利，但今天我们更可以看见，最后定稿的宪法草案，在某些方面，也同时强烈地反映了我们中国悠久文化的优良传统。这一方面的特色是不容忽视的。
    更重要的特点是：制订这一部宪法草案的基本原则，不仅在于针对当前的现实或着重百年大计，同时也缜密地照顾到我们国家一步一步进展的形势。由于它是从发展的观点来看待国家一切设施和规划，它就不像资本主义国家的宪法那样，充满了不切实际的呆板条文，而是具有高度灵活性，也就是具有高度科学性的。在我们国家朝着社会主义迈进的过程中，它能适应经济成份比重和社会制度的改变，它也能对这些方面的改变，发生促进和调节的作用。毫无疑问，这一部庄严而又灵活的国家大典，就是我们的总路线的实现、总任务的完成的绝对保证。因此，对这一宪法草案，我愿意表示无条件的拥护；我相信我们全国的科学工作者，一定会发现更多的理由，对我所提出的这个意见表示赞同。
    陈其尤的发言
    我竭诚拥护即将公布的中华人民共和国宪法草案，同时对这一件空前的大事致以最热烈的祝贺。
    中国以前曾经有过各式各样的所谓宪法，但那些所谓宪法，通通是欺骗人民和麻醉人民的东西，与中国人民的利益是毫不相干的。只有行将公布的中华人民共和国宪法草案，才是真正符合全国人民的要求的。
    由于新民主主义革命的完成，我们国家是在工人阶级领导下逐步过渡到社会主义社会的过程中。我们的宪法草案充分表明了这一特点。它是与苏联和各人民民主国家的宪法同属于社会主义类型的，虽然在形式上并不完全相同。全中国人民都将以有这一部宪法而感到欢欣和骄傲。
    这个宪法草案的公布，是中国人民百多年来奋斗的结果，但这个胜利的果实是和伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导和英勇奋斗分不开的。我们特别要向领导中国人民革命得到胜利因而使这部宪法草案的公布成为现实的伟大的中国共产党和毛主席致以衷诚的感谢和崇高的敬意。
    这部宪草的初稿，是毛主席代表中国共产党中央委员会提出的，并经中央及各地方机关进行了几个月的讨论，现在又要公布全国，使广大的人民都有充分讨论的机会，无疑的，它将成为一部很完善的宪法。我代表中国致公党的全体同志和所联系的华侨群众们完全同意这部宪法草案，并愿早日看到全国人民代表大会正式通过它，更决心为实现它所包含的一切伟大目的而奋斗。
    许德珩的发言
    我以无限兴奋的心情参加这次中央人民政府委员会会议。我代表九三学社，热烈地拥护宪法草案。这个宪法草案是由多少年来我们先烈的鲜血积累起来的，由于中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，我们推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，中华人民共和国建立四年多以来，我们在各方面的战线上都取得了伟大的成就，我们总结了这些成就，才有了这个宪法草案。现在讨论宪法草案的时候，我们不仅热烈地拥护这个宪法草案，并且衷心地感谢毛主席和中国共产党领导的正确。这个宪法草案，体现了全国人民的要求，体现了全国人民的高度的利益，所以这个宪法是人民的宪法。几十年来，中国也曾有过一些非驴非马的所谓“宪法”，从满清的“十九信条”，到国民党的“宪法”，这些都不过是欺骗人民、压迫人民的宪法，为
  一小撮人的利益而压迫大多数人的宪法。我们的宪法草案是真正代表人民、为了人民、实现人民利益的。
    我个人光荣地参加了宪法草案座谈会，在座谈中，大家做到了“知无不言”、“言无不尽”，踊跃地提意见。领导党“虚怀若谷”，凡是可以采纳的意见，无不采纳。这种民主精神，贯穿在宪法草案的每一条的条文中。这种民主精神，我们每一个人都应该学习，学习毛主席的实事求是的民主精神和民主作风。
    这个宪法草案公布后，一定会引起全世界很大的影响。一方面，五亿以上人口的中华人民共和国，总结了革命和建设的经验，写了这个宪法，全世界的人民一定欢欣鼓舞，这将加强和平民主阵营的力量。另一方面，帝国主义一贯与我们为敌，他们尽
  一切力量阻碍、破坏我们，这也是料想得到的。我们要提高警惕，加强团结，团结在中国共产党周围，团结在毛主席周围，实现伟大的中华人民共和国宪法。
    宪法草案第八十一条规定“中华人民共和国总检察长对于国务院所属各部门、地方各级国家行政机关、国家机关工作人员和公民是否遵守法律，行使最高检察职权。”这个规定是非常需要的。在宪法草案公布后，应该加强守法教育，加强守法精神，公务人员要以身作则提高守法精神，使宪法草案真正成为人民爱护国家、遵守法律的宪法草案。
    我代表九三学社衷心拥护“中华人民共和国宪法草案”，希望中央人民政府委员会予以通过。
