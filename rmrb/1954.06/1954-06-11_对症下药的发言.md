Geneva Dispatch

    A Timely Prescription
    By our correspondents Wu Wentao and Li Zhuang
  On June 8th and 9th, at the plenary session discussing the Indochina issue, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai delivered constructive speeches. All fair-minded voices of public opinion concerned about peace in Indochina regard these speeches as timely medicine to advance the discussion of the Indochina issue and remove obstacles in the path to success.
    It has been a full month since the Geneva Conference began discussing the Indochina issue. After numerous open and restricted meetings, the participating countries have indeed reached certain agreements. However, as Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out: "Judging from the time spent and the actual situation of the conference, the achievements of the conference are still insufficient, the progress of the conference is still slow, and our conference still falls short of the expectations of the people of the world."
    What issues and what reasons are hindering the development of the conference? What is the key to achieving lasting peace in Indochina?
    Following the principled agreement on comprehensive and simultaneous ceasefire and regrouping of forces reached at the restricted meeting on May 29th, the conference has mainly discussed the issue of supervision of the cessation of hostilities for the past ten days. On this issue, according to the suggestions of the Vietnamese, Chinese, and Soviet sides, a mixed commission should be established, including representatives of the command headquarters of both belligerent parties, to ensure the implementation of various provisions of the armistice agreement. At the same time, a supervisory commission composed of appropriate neutral countries should be established to supervise, observe, and investigate the implementation of the armistice agreement by both belligerent parties, and, at the invitation of the mixed commission or one of the parties, investigate various incidents of violation of the armistice agreement, and propose recommendations to the belligerent parties to eliminate various violations of the agreement. If major incidents occur that the mixed commission cannot handle and the recommendations of the neutral nations supervisory commission are ineffective, they should be submitted to the countries participating in the guarantee for handling, and the relevant countries should take collective measures to resolve them appropriately. It is quite obvious that this is a reasonable and feasible suggestion. To take care of the interests of both belligerent parties in order to achieve fairness and reasonableness, the Soviet delegation proposed that the neutral nations supervisory commission be composed of India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Pakistan. The delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China expressed their full support for this proposal.
    However, as with previous discussions on other issues, certain Western countries, led by the United States, and their puppets, are trying every means to raise objections. They dare not openly reject the Vietnamese, Chinese, and Soviet proposals to establish a mixed commission and a neutral nations supervisory commission, and are instead employing their tricks of delaying and hindering the progress of the conference on the issues of the membership of the neutral nations supervisory commission, the scope of authority of the neutral nations supervisory commission and the armistice commission, and their interrelationships. Stripped of all their flowery rhetoric, what remains is only a naked body: the members of the neutral nations supervisory commission should only be some countries that they deem satisfactory, and the mixed commission should be subordinate to the so-called neutral nations supervisory commission composed of these countries, or simply merge the mixed commission into the neutral nations supervisory commission, then everything can be manipulated at their will. They dislike most that the neutral nations supervisory commission should adopt the principle of consensus in dealing with issues, and they demand that everything be decided by majority vote. The reason why they oppose this principle, which is the fairest, most reasonable, and most capable of solving major problems in current international affairs, is precisely to impose the will of one party on the other.
    Everyone knows that the realization of the armistice agreement basically depends on the sincerity of both belligerent parties, and therefore the mixed commission composed of representatives of the command headquarters of both belligerent parties should bear the main responsibility for the implementation of the armistice agreement. The role of the neutral nations supervisory commission is to conduct necessary supervision and investigation of certain possible violations of the armistice agreement. These two institutions should cooperate on a parallel basis. In view of the fact that the work of the neutral nations supervisory commission involves the interests of both belligerent parties, the neutral nations supervisory commission must be composed of countries that have diplomatic relations with both belligerent parties in order to handle all issues fairly without being partial to one side. Only in this way can it be guaranteed that its recommendations are acceptable to both belligerent parties and that the Indochina armistice can be consolidated.
    It is worth noting here that the U.S. representative, at the end of his sophistry, attacked the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea without any basis, insisting that its work had failed due to its adherence to the principle of consensus, and attempting to prove by this that such institutions are undesirable. Smith's purpose in doing so was none other than to kill three birds with one stone. The first is to attack the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea to make it completely lose its function; the second is to prove by this that it is impossible to establish a neutral nations supervisory commission to supervise the elections in Korea; and the third is to make it impossible to establish a neutral nations supervisory commission in Indochina. In this way, he may achieve the goal of both sabotaging the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and obstructing the restoration of peace in Indochina.
    Of course, if one wants to achieve a consolidated peace in Indochina, it is not enough to reach an agreement on the above-mentioned military armistice issues, the fundamental issue lies in the resolution of political issues. People remember that the US and French sides did not want to discuss political issues. It was only under the pressure of world opinion that they agreed to the principle put forward by the Vietnamese, Chinese and Soviet sides that both political and military issues should be discussed. Their current tactic is to delay the discussion of military issues as much as possible in order to push the political issues, that is, the issue of satisfying the Indochinese people's rights to national independence and freedom, into the unknowable future. The French colonialists waged a colonial war for eight years, attempting to use aircraft and artillery to overwhelm the Indochinese people's will for national independence, but they failed completely. Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong had already put forward reasonable principles for resolving this issue at the plenary session on May 10th, and it would not be difficult to resolve this if the French side were sincere. However, many facts have proved that the French colonialists are not giving up. According to Reuters, many French parliamentarians have always believed that Bidault "does not really want to achieve peace in Indochina, but would rather the Geneva talks fail so that the United States can join the war." The French newspaper "Liberation" worriedly said: "Every day one can see people who do not believe in peace coming up with new objections. These people do not want peace and would rather expand the war... It is the United States that is instigating France's stubbornness."
  "Journal de Gen√®ve" wrote even more bluntly: "When the American staff believes that the armistice is not good and dangerous (perhaps not without reason), it wants to snatch the Indochina issue away from Geneva." The newspaper likened the current situation to a gambling game in the American Far West, where playing cards were on the poker table and guns were under the table; while diplomats were playing cards in Geneva, the military were planning guns in the Pentagon.
    This is why, based on the various situations occurring in the Geneva Conference itself and surrounding the Geneva Conference, Foreign Minister Molotov reminded everyone at the meeting on the 8th that "one gets the impression that not all participants are concerned about the speedy restoration of peace in Indochina. Indeed, some people may come to the Geneva Conference, but their task is not to restore peace in Indochina, but to prove that it is impossible to reach an agreement on the Indochina armistice issue. Moreover, those who are eager to prove that it is impossible to reach an agreement are not simply delaying the Indochina war, and are in fact planning to further expand the war, although this has all its dangerous consequences." After listing the conspiracies and measures led by Washington to expand the war, Foreign Minister Molotov said: "As for the Soviet Union, it does not regard the cessation of hostilities in Indochina as a short-term respite for continuing or even expanding the war in the future, but as the establishment of a consolidated peace. Because of this, we believe that both military and political issues must be discussed at the Geneva Conference."
    It is generally believed that the three proposals put forward by Foreign Minister Molotov, and fully supported by the Chinese and Vietnamese Democratic Republic delegations, requiring the Geneva Conference to immediately conduct parallel discussions on Indochina military and political issues, are effective steps to accelerate the conference to reach a satisfactory agreement. Precisely because of this, the American aggressive forces showed annoyance with it. This is because its conspiracy to delay and sabotage the Geneva Conference in order to expand the Indochina war was exposed, and it was embarrassed into anger. French and world public opinion are paying attention to the actions of the French authorities; it will be extremely dangerous if they continue to follow the US war policy and refuse to be treated.
