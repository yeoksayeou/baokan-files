Geneva Dispatch

    A Timely Prescription
    By our correspondents Wu Wentao and Li Zhuang
  On June 8th and 9th, at the plenary session discussing the Indochina issue, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai delivered constructive speeches. All fair-minded voices of public opinion concerned about peace in Indochina regard these speeches as timely medicine to advance the discussion of the Indochina issue and remove obstacles in the path to success.
    It has been a full month since the Geneva Conference began discussing the Indochina issue. After numerous open and restricted meetings, the participating countries have indeed reached certain agreements. However, as Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out: "Judging from the time spent and the actual situation of the conference, the achievements of the conference are still insufficient, the progress of the conference is still slow, and our conference still falls short of the expectations of the people of the world."
    What issues and what reasons are hindering the development of the conference? What is the key to achieving lasting peace in Indochina?
    Following the principled agreement on comprehensive and simultaneous ceasefire and regrouping of forces reached at the restricted meeting on May 29th, the conference has mainly discussed the issue of supervision of the cessation of hostilities for the past ten days. On this issue, according to the suggestions of the Vietnamese, Chinese, and Soviet sides, a mixed commission should be established, including representatives of the command headquarters of both belligerent parties, to ensure the implementation of various provisions of the armistice agreement. At the same time, a supervisory commission composed of appropriate neutral countries should be established to supervise, observe, and investigate the implementation of the armistice agreement by both belligerent parties, and, at the invitation of the mixed commission or one of the parties, investigate various incidents of violation of the armistice agreement, and propose recommendations to the belligerent parties to eliminate various violations of the agreement. If major incidents occur that the mixed commission cannot handle and the recommendations of the neutral nations supervisory commission are ineffective, they should be submitted to the countries participating in the guarantee for handling, and the relevant countries should take collective measures to resolve them appropriately. It is quite obvious that this is a reasonable and feasible suggestion. To take care of the interests of both belligerent parties in order to achieve fairness and reasonableness, the Soviet delegation proposed that the neutral nations supervisory commission be composed of India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Pakistan. The delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China expressed their full support for this proposal.
    However, as with previous discussions on other issues, certain Western countries, led by the United States, and their puppets, are trying every means to raise objections. They dare not openly reject the Vietnamese, Chinese, and Soviet proposals to establish a mixed commission and a neutral nations supervisory commission, and are instead employing their tricks of delaying and hindering the progress of the conference on the issues of the membership of the neutral nations supervisory commission, the scope of authority of the neutral nations supervisory commission and the armistice commission, and their interrelationships. Stripped of all their flowery rhetoric, what remains is only a naked body: the members of the neutral nations supervisory commission should only be some countries that they deem satisfactory, and the mixed commission should be subordinate to the so-called neutral nations supervisory commission composed of these countries, or simply merge the mixed commission into the neutral nations supervisory commission, then everything can be manipulated at their will. They dislike most that the neutral nations supervisory commission should adopt the principle of consensus in dealing with issues, and they demand that everything be decided by majority vote. The reason why they oppose this principle, which is the fairest, most reasonable, and most capable of solving major problems in current international affairs, is precisely to impose the will of one party on the other.
    Everyone knows that the realization of the armistice agreement basically depends on the sincerity of both belligerent parties, and therefore the mixed commission composed of representatives of the command headquarters of both belligerent parties should bear the main responsibility for the implementation of the armistice agreement. The role of the neutral nations supervisory commission is to conduct necessary supervision and investigation of certain possible violations of the armistice agreement. These two institutions should cooperate on a parallel basis. In view of the fact that the work of the neutral nations supervisory commission involves the interests of both belligerent parties, the neutral nations supervisory commission must be composed of countries that have diplomatic relations with both belligerent parties in order to handle all issues fairly without being partial to one side. Only in this way can it be guaranteed that its recommendations are acceptable to both belligerent parties and that the Indochina armistice can be consolidated.
    It is worth noting here that the U.S. representative, at the end of his sophistry, attacked the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea without any basis, insisting that its work had failed due to its adherence to the principle of consensus, and attempting to prove by this that such institutions are undesirable. Smith's purpose in doing so was none other than to kill three birds with one stone. The first is to attack the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea to make it completely lose its function; the second is to prove by this that it is impossible to establish a neutral nations supervisory commission to supervise the elections in Korea; and the third is to make it impossible to establish a neutral nations supervisory commission in Indochina. In this way, he may achieve the goal of both sabotaging the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and obstructing the restoration of peace in Indochina.
    Of course, if one wants to achieve a consolidated peace in Indochina, it is not enough to reach an agreement on the above-mentioned military armistice issues, the fundamental issue lies in the resolution of political issues. People remember that the US and French sides did not want to discuss political issues. It was only under the pressure of world opinion that they agreed to the principle put forward by the Vietnamese, Chinese and Soviet sides that both political and military issues should be discussed. Their current tactic is to delay the discussion of military issues as much as possible in order to push the political issues, that is, the issue of satisfying the Indochinese people's rights to national independence and freedom, into the unknowable future. The French colonialists waged a colonial war for eight years, attempting to use aircraft and artillery to overwhelm the Indochinese people's will for national independence, but they failed completely. Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong had already put forward reasonable principles for resolving this issue at the plenary session on May 10th, and it would not be difficult to resolve this if the French side were sincere. However, many facts have proved that the French colonialists are not giving up. According to Reuters, many French parliamentarians have always believed that Bidault "does not really want to achieve peace in Indochina, but would rather the Geneva talks fail so that the United States can join the war." The French newspaper "Liberation" worriedly said: "Every day one can see people who do not believe in peace coming up with new objections. These people do not want peace and would rather expand the war... It is the United States that is instigating France's stubbornness."
  "Journal de Genève" wrote even more bluntly: "When the American staff believes that the armistice is not good and dangerous (perhaps not without reason), it wants to snatch the Indochina issue away from Geneva." The newspaper likened the current situation to a gambling game in the American Far West, where playing cards were on the poker table and guns were under the table; while diplomats were playing cards in Geneva, the military were planning guns in the Pentagon.
    This is why, based on the various situations occurring in the Geneva Conference itself and surrounding the Geneva Conference, Foreign Minister Molotov reminded everyone at the meeting on the 8th that "one gets the impression that not all participants are concerned about the speedy restoration of peace in Indochina. Indeed, some people may come to the Geneva Conference, but their task is not to restore peace in Indochina, but to prove that it is impossible to reach an agreement on the Indochina armistice issue. Moreover, those who are eager to prove that it is impossible to reach an agreement are not simply delaying the Indochina war, and are in fact planning to further expand the war, although this has all its dangerous consequences." After listing the conspiracies and measures led by Washington to expand the war, Foreign Minister Molotov said: "As for the Soviet Union, it does not regard the cessation of hostilities in Indochina as a short-term respite for continuing or even expanding the war in the future, but as the establishment of a consolidated peace. Because of this, we believe that both military and political issues must be discussed at the Geneva Conference."
    It is generally believed that the three proposals put forward by Foreign Minister Molotov, and fully supported by the Chinese and Vietnamese Democratic Republic delegations, requiring the Geneva Conference to immediately conduct parallel discussions on Indochina military and political issues, are effective steps to accelerate the conference to reach a satisfactory agreement. Precisely because of this, the American aggressive forces showed annoyance with it. This is because its conspiracy to delay and sabotage the Geneva Conference in order to expand the Indochina war was exposed, and it was embarrassed into anger. French and world public opinion are paying attention to the actions of the French authorities; it will be extremely dangerous if they continue to follow the US war policy and refuse to be treated.

    对症下药的发言
    本报记者　吴文焘　李庄
  六月八日和九日，在讨论印度支那问题的全体大会上，苏联外长莫洛托夫、越南民主共和国代外长范文同和中国外长周恩来，先后作了建设性的发言。一切正直的，关心印度支那和平的舆论界，都把这些发言看成是推进印度支那问题的讨论、清除摆在成功道路上的障碍的适时良药。
    从日内瓦会议开始讨论印度支那问题以来，已经是整整一个月了。经过多次的公开性和限制性的会议，与会各国诚然已经达成了某些协议。但是，正如周恩来外长所指出的：“如果从一个月的时间和会议的实际情况来看，会议的成就还是很不够的，会议进行的速度还是很缓慢的，我们的会议还很不能满足全世界人民的期望。”
    什么问题、什么原因障碍着会议的发展呢？什么是达到印度支那持久和平的关键呢？
    在五月二十九日的限制性会议就全面同时停火和军队分区集结达成了原则协议之后，十天以来，会议主要是讨论关于停止敌对行动的监察问题。在这个问题上，按照越、中、苏方面的建议，应该成立一个包括交战双方司令部代表的混合委员会，保证执行停战协定的各种条款；同时，成立一个由适当的中立国组成的监察委员会，以监察、观察、调查交战双方执行停战协定的状况，并在混合委员会或其一方的邀请下，调查各种违反停战协定的事件，向交战双方提出消除各种违反协定行为的建议；如发生混合委员会不能处理和中立国监察委员会建议无效的重大事件，则提交参加保证的各国处理，由有关各国采取集体的措施予以适当的解决。十分明显，这是一个合理可行的建议。为了照顾交战双方的利益，以达到公正合理，苏联代表团提议由印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和巴基斯坦四国组成中立国监察委员会。越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国代表团表示完全支持这一建议。
    但是和以往对于其他问题的讨论一样，以美国为首的某些西方国家及其傀儡们却是想尽方法来提出反对的意见。他们不敢公开拒绝越、中、苏提出的成立混合委员会和中立国监察委员会的建议，就在中立国监察委员会的成员问题上，中立国监察委员会和停战委员会的职权范围及其相互关系上，施展其拖延和阻挠会议进展的伎俩。剥去他们的一切花言巧语的外衣，剩下的就只有那样一个赤裸裸的躯体：中立国监察委员会的成员应当只是他们所认为满意的一些国家，而混合委员会又应当隶属于由这些国家组成的所谓中立国监察委员会之下，或者干脆将混合委员会合并于中立国监察委员会，那么一切就可以听他们随意摆布了。他们最不喜欢中立国监察委员会应当采取一致协议的原则来处理问题，他们要求一切按多数表决。他们所以反对这一在目前国际事务中最公正、最合理、最能解决重大问题的原则，正是为了要将一方的意志强加于另一方。
    谁都知道，停战协定的实现基本上依靠交战双方的诚意，因之交战双方司令部代表组成的混合委员会要对实施停战协定负主要责任。中立国监察委员会的作用，就是为了对某些可能发生的违反停战协定的事件加以必要的监察和调查。这两个机构应该在平行的基础上分工合作。鉴于中立国监察委员会的工作涉及交战双方的利益，因之中立国监察委员会必须由和交战双方有外交关系的国家组成，才能公正处理一切问题，而不致偏袒一方。只有这样，才能保证它所作的建议为交战双方可以接受，使印度支那停战得以巩固。
    在这里值得注意的是，美国代表在理曲词穷之余，竟毫无根据地攻击朝鲜中立国监察委员会，硬说它的工作由于遵守一致协议的原则而失败了，并企图以此证明这样的机构是要不得的。史密斯这样作的目的不是别的，而是想用一块石头打死三只鸟。其一是攻击朝鲜中立国监察委员会，使其完全失去作用；其二是以此证明不可能成立中立国监察委员会，以监督朝鲜的选举；其三是使印度支那的中立国监察委员会不可能成立起来。这样，他就可能达到既破坏朝鲜问题的和平解决，又阻挠印度支那恢复和平的目的了。
    当然，要想达到印度支那的巩固和平，不仅上述有关军事停战问题达到协议就算完了，根本的问题还在于政治问题的解决上。人们记得，美法方面是不想讨论政治问题的。他们只是迫于世界舆论的压力，才同意了越、中、苏方面提出的政治问题和军事问题都要讨论的原则。他们现在采取的手法是尽量拖延军事问题的讨论，以便把政治问题，也就是满足印度支那人民民族独立和自由权利的问题推到不可知的将来。法国殖民者进行了八年的殖民战争，企图用飞机、大炮压倒印度支那人民要求民族独立的意志，但是彻底失败了。范文同代外长在五月十日的全体大会上早已提出了解决这个问题的合理原则，只要法国方面具有诚意，这是不难解决的。但是许多事实证明，法国的殖民主义者们是并不死心的。据路透社透露，法国许多议员一直认为，皮杜尔“并不真想在印度支那取得和平，却宁愿日内瓦谈判失败，以便美国能参加战争”。法国“解放报”忧虑地说：“天天都可以看见那些不相信和平的人搞点新的反对意见出来，这些人不希望和平，情愿扩大战争……是美国怂恿法国顽梗不化的。”
  “日内瓦日报”更率直地写道：“当美国参谋部认为不佳和危险（也许不无理由）的停战似乎接近时，就要把印度支那问题从日内瓦抢走。”该报把现在的形势比作美国极西部的赌博，扑克台上是纸牌，台下是手枪；当外交家在日内瓦玩牌的时候，军人们却在五角大楼打算着手枪。
    这就是为什么根据日内瓦会议本身和围绕着日内瓦会议所发生的种种情势，莫洛托夫外长在八日的会议上提醒大家说：“人们产生了一种印象：并不是所有的与会者都关心尽速恢复印度支那的和平的。的确，有的人可以来参加日内瓦会议，但他的任务并不是恢复印度支那和平，而是证明不可能就印度支那停战问题达成协议。而且那些急于证明不可能达成协议的人并不是简单地在拖延印度支那战争，并且事实上还在策划进一步扩大战争，虽然这有其一切危险的后果。”在列举了为华盛顿所主导的扩大战争阴谋和措施之后，莫洛托夫外长说：“至于苏联，它并不把在印度支那停止敌对行动的问题看作是今后继续战争、或者甚至扩大战争的短期喘息机会，而是看作是巩固和平的建立。正因为这样，我们才认为，必须在日内瓦会议上既讨论军事问题，也讨论政治问题。”
    一般认为，莫洛托夫外长所提出的、为中国和越南民主共和国代表团全力支持的、要求日内瓦会议对于印度支那军事和政治问题立即进行平行的讨论等三项建议，是使会议加速达成完满协议的有效步骤。正因为如此，美国的侵略势力对它表现了恼怒。这是因为它的拖延、破坏日内瓦会议以达到扩大印度支那战争的阴谋被戳穿了，因而老羞成怒了。法国和全世界的舆论正在注意着法国的当权者们的所作所为；如果他们继续追随美国的战争政策，讳疾忌医，那将是万分危险的。
