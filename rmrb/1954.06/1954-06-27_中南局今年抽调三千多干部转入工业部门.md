    Central South Bureau Transfers Over Three Thousand Cadres to Industrial Departments This Year

    The Central South Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party has transferred over three thousand cadres to important industrial departments such as state-owned steel, machinery, non-ferrous metals, and electricity in the first half of this year. Among them, there are over one thousand nine hundred veteran cadres at or above the county level and over one thousand five hundred intellectual cadres who have been tempered. They have successively taken up their posts within June. The transfer of this group of cadres to the industrial departments not only meets the current need of various industrial departments for cadres in terms of quantity, but also largely meets the standards stipulated by the Central South Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party in terms of quality. Among the more than one thousand nine hundred veteran cadres at or above the county level, there are two hundred and fifty-seven cadres who are members of local committees of the Chinese Communist Party or above. Most of them have been tempered through long-term revolutionary struggles and have a cultural level of junior high school or above. Their transfer to industrial construction departments will enable them to quickly become familiar with the business. Among the more than one thousand five hundred intellectual cadres, most are also politically pure, tempered through land reform and other movements, and have a certain level of ideological understanding and working ability.

    In order to adapt to the development of various construction undertakings in the Central South District during the First Five-Year Plan, the Central South Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party considered the issue of guaranteeing the cadre needs of these construction departments early on in a comprehensive manner. Based on the construction of many large factories and mines in the entire district, it decided to transfer more than six thousand cadres from rural areas and organs to industrial and other construction departments in 1954 (the cadres who have been transferred now account for more than one-half of the planned transfer for the entire year). This group of cadres will first meet the needs of new and renovated factories and mines in enterprises aided by the Soviet Union in the construction of our country, as well as universities, specialized colleges, technical schools, and cultural schools, and will also give corresponding consideration to other new and renovated units. In order to do a good job in this huge transfer of cadres, the Organization Department of the Central South Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party began to understand the situation, formulate plans, and make preparations in many aspects as early as December last year. In mid-April of this year, it also convened a cadre work conference in the entire district, putting forward the guiding principles and tasks for transferring cadres. This decision was enthusiastically supported by party organizations at all levels throughout the district. Provinces and cities have conducted strict selection and review when selecting cadres, and implemented a system of responsibility at each level. All localities have ensured that more outstanding cadres are transferred to industrial construction departments. While transferring this group of cadres, all localities have also taken into account the arduous task of carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture, and therefore have also retained a portion of stronger cadres to grasp the work of key special districts and counties.

    In the two years of 1952 and 1953, the Central South Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party has transferred more than three thousand veteran cadres at or above the county level, more than three thousand intellectual cadres who returned to technical work, and more than seven hundred intellectual cadres with a cultural level of junior high school graduation or above to industrial and various construction undertakings. After more than two years of training, many veteran cadres have become familiar with production, learned a set of scientific management methods for socialist enterprises, and become important leading backbones of existing factories and mines.

    中南局今年抽调三千多干部转入工业部门
    中共中央中南局今年上半年已抽调了三千多个干部转入国营钢铁、机械、有色金属、电力等重要的工业部门。其中有一千九百多个县级以上的老干部和一千五百多个经过锻炼的知识分子干部。他们已在六月份内陆续走上工作岗位。这批干部的转入工业部门，不仅在数量上满足各工业部门目前对于干部的需要，而且质量上也大都符合中共中央中南局规定的标准。在一千九百多个县级以上的老干部中就有二百五十七个中国共产党地方委员会委员以上的干部。他们大多经过长期的革命斗争的锻炼，具有初中以上的文化水平，他们转入工业建设部门将能迅速熟悉业务。在一千五百多个知识分子干部中，也大都是政治纯洁，经过土地改革等运动的锻炼，有一定的思想水平和工作能力。
    为了适应第一个五年计划内中南区各项建设事业的发展，中共中央中南局很早就全盘考虑了保证这些建设部门的干部需要问题，并根据全区许多大厂矿筹建工作情况，决定在一九五四年内从农村和机关中共抽调六千多个干部转入工业和其他建设部门（现已抽调的干部占全年计划抽调的干部二分之一以上）。这批干部将首先满足属于苏联帮助我国建设的企业中的新建、改建厂矿，以及大学、专科学校、技术学校和文化学校的需要，并相应地照顾其他新建和改建单位。为做好这一规模巨大的干部转移工作，中共中央中南局组织部从去年十二月份就开始了解情况，制订计划，进行了多方面的准备，今年四月中旬又召开了全区干部工作会议，提出了抽调干部的方针和任务。这个决定得到了全区各级党组织的热烈拥护，各省、市在选拔干部时都经过严格的挑选和审查，实行了逐级负责制。各地都保证把较优秀的干部输送到工业建设部门去。在抽调这批干部的同时，各地也兼顾到对农业进行社会主义改造的繁重任务，因此也都保留了一部分较强的干部掌握重点专区和县的工作。
    中共中央中南局在一九五二年和一九五三年两年内已从农村和机关抽调了三千多个县级以上的老干部，三千多个技术归队的知识分子干部和七百多个具有初中毕业以上文化水平的知识分子干部转移到工业和各种建设事业上去。经过两年多来的锻炼，不少老干部已熟悉了生产，学会了社会主义企业的一套科学的管理方法，成为现有厂矿的重要领导骨干。　（新华社）
