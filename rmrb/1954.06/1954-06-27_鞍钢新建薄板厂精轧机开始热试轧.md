Anshan Iron and Steel's new thin plate plant—China's first mechanized and automated thin plate plant—began hot test rolling on the finishing mill of a certain machine on the 23rd. A batch of thin steel plates was successfully rolled out, and after inspection, the quality was good. These thin plates will become finished products after processes such as annealing, leveling, or galvanizing. Finishing rolling is the most important and technically complex production process in the entire plant. After all finishing mills have undergone hot test rolling, this modern factory can be put into production soon. (Xinhua News Agency)

    鞍钢新建薄板厂精轧机开始热试轧
    我国新建第一座机械化自动化的薄板厂——鞍山钢铁公司第二薄板厂，在二十三日某号精轧机开始热试轧，顺利地轧出了一批薄钢板，经过检验，质量良好。这些薄板再经过退火、平整或镀锌等加工就成为成品了。精轧是全厂最重要的技术最复杂的生产过程。所有精轧机热试轧以后，这座现代化的工厂就可很快投入生产。　（新华社）
