    The newly built Hanyang Sleeper Anti-Corrosion Factory held its trial operation ceremony on April 30th. Ordinary sleepers can only be used for two or three years before they rot. After being oil-injected and steamed into anti-corrosion sleepers, the service life can be extended to fifteen years. Therefore, this factory can save the country several trillion yuan in sleeper materials every year.

    新建汉阳枕木防腐工厂
    新建的汉阳枕木防腐工厂，已在四月三十日举行了试车典礼。通常的枕木只能使用二、三年就要腐烂，经注油蒸制成防腐枕木后，使用年限可延长到十五年，因此，这个工厂每年即可为国家节省数千亿元的枕木用材。
