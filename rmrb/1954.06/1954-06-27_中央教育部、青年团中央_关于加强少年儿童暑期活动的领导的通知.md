The purpose of summer activities for children and young people is to enable them to have beneficial rest during the holidays, improve their health, broaden their horizons, and continue to receive education. In recent years, educational administrative organs, schools, and Communist Youth League organizations in many places have begun to attach importance to and lead this work, enabling children and young people to spend a pleasant and meaningful summer vacation and to meet the learning tasks of the new semester with full energy. However, there are still many regions and schools that have not given due attention and leadership to children's summer activities, so that the children and young people in these places cannot get the education and guidance from schools, teachers, and Young Pioneer instructors during the long holidays. They lack activity venues, their lives are boring and dull, and some children are also affected by bad people, bad things, and bad books in society, which greatly weakens or offsets the effect of school education. For this reason, we ask the educational administrative departments and Communist Youth League organizations in various places to strengthen the leadership of this year's children's summer activities. At the provincial, municipal, county, and district levels, a summer work committee can be formed by the educational administration, the Communist Youth League, and the educational trade union to comprehensively consider the overall summer work, and to draw up plans. While taking care of teachers' rest, reasonably allocate their tasks of leading children's summer activities and educating primary school graduates. In addition, students from universities and colleges, especially normal schools, can be appropriately mobilized to participate in the work, to lead the vast number of children and young people to participate in various meaningful and interesting activities. The following opinions are put forward in the hope that they will be studied and implemented in various places.

    I. The content of children's summer activities should be subordinate to the purpose of summer activities, suitable for the characteristics of summer, and suitable for the abilities, levels, and interests of children of different ages. In summer, more outdoor activities can be carried out to educate children and young people to insist on doing morning exercises every day, and to hold various sports, games, and recreational activities. Summer is also a good opportunity for children to observe and study nature, and to cultivate children's interest and hobby in cultivating flowers and plants, collecting specimens, and raising animals. Summer is also suitable for short trips, visits, and visits to enable children to understand and familiarize themselves with the local or nearby history, geography, people's lives, and the construction of the motherland. Storytelling sessions and art evenings can also be held in the summer evenings. During the summer vacation, attention should be paid to guiding children to read books and educating them to be good at arranging their personal lives and doing their summer homework. Educate children to help with housework or agricultural labor within their ability at home, and to carry out appropriate social work, etc. Local schools and Young Pioneer organizations can determine which activities to carry out according to the plans of the city (county) and district, and according to the possible conditions in their locality.

    II. The organizational form of summer activities should be adapted to people and places. In general areas, the main units are the Young Pioneer team (class group) of the school or the temporary team (group) formed by the Young Pioneers and students in the nearby area, and various scattered small-scale activities are carried out regularly. During the entire summer vacation, several more centralized activities can also be held, such as stipulating student return days, organizing activities, or holding squadron meetings. In areas and schools with conditions, summer children's parks (children's clubs) can be organized in schools, public places, or larger rural residences, with various sports game equipment, books, etc., so that nearby children can often have venues and conditions for activities, and use this as a stronghold for guiding and organizing various children's activities. In areas or schools with relatively good conditions, short-term "inner-city summer camps" can be organized. The characteristic of this summer camp is that children go home for accommodation and meals, and come to the camp for collective life and various activities for a certain period of time every day. (Depending on the specific situation, it can be stipulated that children should have a certain amount of time to help with housework and live family life.) In some cities or places with beautiful scenery, if conditions permit, relevant parties should be united to hold summer camps. The educational administrative departments, the Communist Youth League committees, and the extra-curricular education organs for children and young people at the municipal and district levels can also organize various evening parties and sports, games, competitions, etc.

    III. Children's summer activities are a matter of common concern to parents and people from all walks of life. The educational administrative departments and Communist Youth League organizations in various places should do their best to obtain the support and assistance of all relevant parties, especially cultural and educational organs and groups, trade unions, various industrial and mining enterprises, and neighborhood committees, parents, etc., to create conditions for children's off-campus activities, such as holding summer camps, planning activity venues and funds, showing early shows of movies, opening parks, stadiums, libraries, etc.

    IV. The teachers and Young Pioneer instructors in the school should help the children make an activity plan before the summer vacation, and guide them on how to spend the summer vacation well. When teachers and instructors are working, they should be good at listening to children's opinions, giving play to their enthusiasm and creativity, and cultivating activists in various activities. During the summer vacation, teachers and instructors should arrange the dates of work and rest, regularly check the progress of children's activities to guide them, and help them solve some difficult problems.

    V. Summer vacation activities should pay close attention to children's health and safety. There should not be too many or too large activities, but one should not simply adopt the method of prohibiting children from engaging in certain activities, but should strengthen health and safety education for children, and actively guide and organize children to participate in various proper, beneficial, and interesting activities. For some activities that may cause danger or affect health, adults must be responsible for guidance and leadership.

    中央教育部、青年团中央
    关于加强少年儿童暑期活动的领导的通知
    少年儿童暑期活动的目的，是使少年儿童在假期中获得有益的休息，增进健康，扩大眼界和继续受到教育。几年来，有不少地方的教育行政机关、学校和青年团组织已经开始重视和领导这方面的工作，使少年儿童们能够过一个愉快而有意义的暑假，并以饱满的精神来迎接新学期的学习任务。但是，还有许多地区和学校对于儿童的暑期活动并没有给予应有的重视和领导，以至这些地方的少年儿童们，在漫长的假期中，得不到学校、教师和少先队辅导员的教育和指导，没有活动的场所，生活枯燥无聊，有些儿童还受到社会上坏人、坏事、坏书的影响，大大地减弱或者抵消了学校教育的效果。为此，我们要求各地教育行政部门和青年团组织加强领导今年的儿童暑期活动，在省、市、县、区一级可由教育行政、青年团、教育工会等方面组成暑期工作委员会，统一考虑暑期的全面工作，并订出计划，在照顾教师休息的原则下，合理地分配他们领导儿童暑期活动和对小学毕业生进行教育等任务。此外并可以适当地动员大、中学校，特别是师范学校的学生参加工作，以领导广大的少年儿童参加各种有意义、有趣味的活动。兹提出下列意见，望各地研究执行。
    一、儿童暑期活动的内容应服从暑期活动的目的，适合夏季的特点，并适合不同年龄儿童的能力、水平和兴趣。夏季可多搞户外活动，教育少年儿童坚持每天做早操，多举行各种体育、游戏和文娱活动。夏季又是儿童观察和研究自然的好机会，可培养儿童培植花草、采制标本、饲养动物的兴趣和爱好。夏季也适宜于举行短途旅行、参观、访问，使儿童了解和熟悉本地或本地附近的历史、地理、人民生活和祖国建设的情况。还可利用夏季晚上举行故事会、文艺晚会。暑期中应当注意指导儿童阅读书籍并教育儿童善于安排个人的生活，做好暑期作业。教育儿童在家帮助做力所能及的家务或者农业劳动，进行适当的社会工作等。各地学校和少先队组织可以按照市、（县）区的计划，根据当地可能的条件，确定进行哪一些活动。
    二、暑期活动的组织形式，要因人因地制宜。在一般地区主要以学校少先队小队（班级小组）或者以邻近地区少先队员和学生临时编成的小队（小组）为单位，定期展开多种多样分散性的小型的活动。在整个暑期中，还可以举行若干次较为集中的活动，如规定学生返校日，组织活动，或者举行中队集会等。有条件的地区和学校，可以在学校、公共场所或者在较大的农村住宅中，组织暑期儿童乐园（儿童俱乐部），设置各种体育游戏用具、图书等，使附近儿童能经常有活动的场地和条件，并以此作为指导和组织各种儿童活动的据点。条件较为良好的地区或者学校，可以组织短期的“城内夏令营”，这种夏令营的特点是儿童住宿和吃饭都回家，每天有一定时间到营里来过集体生活和进行各种活动。（可以根据具体情况规定，应该使儿童有一定时间帮助家务和过家庭生活。）在若干城市或风景优美的地方，如条件可能，则应联合有关方面，举办夏令营。市、区一级的教育行政部门、团委和少年儿童的校外教育机关还可以组织各种晚会和体育、游戏、比赛等。
    三、儿童暑期活动是家长和社会人士所共同关心的事。各地教育行政部门和青年团组织应尽力取得各有关方面，特别是文化教育机关和团体、工会、各工矿企业部门，以及居民委员会、家长等的支持和协助，为儿童创造校外活动的条件，如举办夏令营、筹划活动场地和经费，放映早场电影，开放公园、体育场、图书馆等等。
    四、学校中的教师和少先队辅导员要在暑期以前，帮助儿童订出活动计划，指导他们如何过好暑期。教师和辅导员在进行工作时，要善于听取儿童的意见，发挥他们的积极性和创造性，培养各种活动中的积极分子。在暑期中，教师和辅导员应该安排好工作和休息的日期，定期检查儿童活动进行的情况加以指导，并帮助他们解决一些困难问题。
    五、暑假活动应十分注意儿童的健康和安全。活动不宜过多、过大，但是也不要单纯地采取禁止儿童进行某些活动的办法，而应该加强对儿童进行健康和安全教育，积极地引导和组织儿童参加各种正当、有益和有趣味的活动。对于某些可能产生危险或影响健康的活动，一定要有成人负责指导和带领。
