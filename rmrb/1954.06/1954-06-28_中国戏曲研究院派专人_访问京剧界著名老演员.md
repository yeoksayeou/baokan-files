The Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera has dispatched specialists to interview famous veteran Peking Opera actors, recording and compiling their realistic creative methods and performance art accumulated over decades of Peking Opera performance.

Many veteran actors in the Peking Opera scene are now teaching at the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera's opera school. This interviewing work began last September and has successively included interviews with famous Xiaosheng (young male role) Jiang Miaoxiang, who is over sixty years old, famous Wusheng (male martial role) Shang Heyu, who is over eighty years old, famous Choujiao (clown role) Xiao Changhua, who is over seventy years old, and famous Danjiao (female role) Wang Yaoqing (recently deceased). The interviews revealed that many veteran actors emphasize that Peking Opera performance should not be bound by performance routines but should start from life and the characters, and carry out artistic creation based on the different personalities and life situations of the characters in the play. The initial draft of interview materials compiled from January to June this year has reached more than 80,000 words. Special interviews include Xiao Changhua discussing Choujiao, Jiang Miaoxiang discussing the process of rehearsing and performing the play "Ji Yu Ji Quan," Shang Heyu discussing the logic of drama, Yu Lianquan discussing the performance art of the play "Picking up the Jade Bracelet," and Wang Yaoqing discussing the process of creating the "Willow Shade Record" aria. The interviewers mainly faithfully recorded the rich experience accumulated by these veteran actors in their decades of artistic life and then gradually organized it, and after selection, published it in newspapers and periodicals.

The work of recording and compiling the artistic creation of veteran Peking Opera actors conducted by the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera has been warmly welcomed by the veteran actors. Veteran actor Shang Heyu excitedly stated that he wanted to pass on what he knew to the next generation through this interview. In order for the interviewers to more deeply understand the performance details in martial arts plays, this veteran actor also taught rehearsals on the spot. He also introduced many creative methods and performance methods of several veteran actors in plays such as "Picking the Carriage" and "Conquering Eastern Wu." From early March to early June, the interviewers and Shang Heyu talked a total of twenty-five times. When Xiao Changhua talked to the visitors, sometimes he talked from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., which deeply moved the interviewers.

The interviewers plan to establish closer relationships with the veteran actors in the future and become familiar with their lives in many ways. (Xinhua News Agency)
