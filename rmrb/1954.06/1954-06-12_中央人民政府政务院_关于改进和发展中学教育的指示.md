    Instruction of the State Administrative Council of the Central People's Government on Improving and Developing Secondary Education
    (Adopted at the 212th Administrative Council Meeting on April 8, 1954)
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, secondary education nationwide has undergone tremendous restoration and development. A series of reforms have also been implemented, such as increasing the proportion of students from worker and peasant families, ideological remolding, teaching reforms, and the use of ethnic languages in schools for minority nationalities. These measures are fundamentally in line with the spirit of the general task of the country during the transition period. In 1953, the number of secondary school students nationwide increased by 185 percent compared to 1949, greatly exceeding the highest number in old Chinese history. In 1953, children of workers and peasants accounted for 57.3 percent of the total student population, and the number of female students has also been increasing. Textbooks have been initially reformed, and teaching methods have also begun to improve. The ideology of the working class has taken a leading position in school education, and there has been significant progress in the thinking of teachers and students. Students' knowledge levels are also gradually improving. These achievements have laid the foundation for the further development and improvement of secondary education in our country. Over the past four years, more than 216,000 students have graduated from senior high schools nationwide, and 1,055,000 students have graduated from junior high schools, making great contributions to the country's cultivation of talent and beginning to provide a new force with certain political consciousness and cultural levels for the production front. Over the past four years, faculty and staff at secondary schools across the country have made great efforts to educate the younger generation and have made contributions to the country and the people. However, on the other hand, there are still many problems, shortcomings, and errors in secondary education. The main ones are that senior high schools cannot supply enough qualified students to universities and colleges; students' political awareness and cultural level are not high enough, and their physical fitness is not healthy enough; the teaching plans and materials are not practical enough; the number of teachers is insufficient, and their quality is not high enough; some schools still lack leadership backbone, and the political and ideological work in schools is still lacking; not enough attention is paid to uniting teachers. The reasons for these shortcomings and errors are mainly due to the weak political and ideological leadership of educational administrative leading organs over secondary education, the failure to clearly explain the nature and tasks of secondary education, and, particularly seriously, the neglect of labor education. A systematic and profound criticism of the exploiting class ideology of despising physical labor and the working people which was prevalent in school education in the old society has not been carried out, and this is an error of principle. In order to further improve and develop secondary education, the following instructions are hereby issued:
    1. The purpose of secondary education is to educate students with socialist ideas and cultivate them into all-round developed members of socialist society. Secondary education should not only supply universities and colleges with enough qualified new students, but also supply the country's production and construction with a new force that has a certain level of political awareness, cultural literacy, and physical fitness. Therefore, after graduation, most secondary school graduates, in addition to those who go on to higher education according to national needs, should actively engage in industrial and agricultural production labor or other construction work.
    2. The current working policy of secondary education should be: in accordance with the general task of the country during the transition period, on the basis of consolidation, to develop in a planned and focused manner according to needs and possibilities, and to actively and steadily improve the quality of secondary education, especially to run senior high schools, complete secondary schools, and worker-peasant rapid middle schools well. The development of secondary education should focus on the development of senior high schools, and junior high schools should also be developed appropriately according to possible conditions. The current development of secondary schools should neither be passive and conservative, nor blindly advance. Development plans should be formulated realistically, and attention should be paid to giving full play to potential, creating conditions, and actively overcoming difficulties in development.
    3. Secondary schools must implement all-round development education. Due to insufficient understanding of all-round development education in the past, many schools have consistently failed to pay attention to students' physical health, and have neglected the teaching of scientific knowledge because of emphasizing political and ideological education; recently, many schools have relaxed political and ideological education because of emphasizing the teaching of scientific knowledge. These one-sided practices that focus on one thing and neglect another are wrong and must be corrected. In the future, our secondary education must not only strengthen political and ideological education, but also pay attention to the teaching of systematic scientific knowledge, and also pay attention to physical education and hygiene.
    1. The task of political and ideological education is to establish a socialist political orientation, cultivate the foundation of a dialectical materialist worldview and communist morality. To this end, it is necessary to consolidate and strengthen the leading position of the working-class ideology in secondary schools, enhance socialist thinking, thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology, and continue to eliminate the remaining feudal, comprador, and fascist ideologies.
    Political and ideological education should continue to cultivate the national morality of "love for the motherland, love for the people, love for labor, love for science, and care for public property" according to the students' existing ideological situation, and pay attention to cultivating collectivist spirit, conscious discipline, and qualities such as perseverance, courage, humility, honesty, thrift, and simplicity. At present, special emphasis should be placed on strengthening patriotic education, labor education, and conscious discipline education.
    Patriotic education is to cultivate students' love for the motherland and their willingness to devote themselves to the socialist construction of the motherland, strengthen the concept of the state, and establish the concept of personal interests subordinate to national interests. While carrying out patriotic education, attention should be paid to cultivating the spirit of internationalism.
    Labor education is to cultivate students' socialist views on labor, regard labor as a glorious cause, love labor, and have a conscious and positive attitude towards labor; and correct the erroneous thinking of despising physical labor and despising workers and peasants. In school education, students should be appropriately organized to do some physical labor within their capabilities that is educational and meaningful, in coordination with classroom teaching.
    The purpose of conscious discipline education is to cultivate students' consciousness and enthusiasm for learning, consciously abide by school rules, respect teachers, care for school property, maintain school order, respect collective interests, and cultivate the idea of ​​abiding by social order and national laws. The phenomenon of lax discipline in some schools at present must be seriously overcome.
    Political and ideological education mainly relies on teachers to carry out through classroom teaching of various subjects and extracurricular activities. Therefore, both inside and outside the classroom, students should be armed with socialist ideas from a positive perspective, according to the characteristics of young people. Persuasion is the basic method of political and ideological education. Good behavior of students should be praised and encouraged. Students' erroneous thoughts and behaviors should not be allowed to go unchecked, nor should they be handled in a simple and crude manner. They should be guided patiently, enlightened, given appropriate criticism, and helped to correct their errors. If it is necessary to take appropriate punishment, it should also be used as an auxiliary method of education, and attention must be paid to preventing the tendency of punitivism. The Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers should assist schools in conducting political and ideological education.
    2. Improve teaching to arm students with advanced scientific knowledge. This first requires teachers to work hard to study the teaching materials, deeply understand and master the teaching objectives, ideological content, and scientific content of their taught subjects, and correspondingly improve teaching methods to achieve correct and systematic teaching. This requires teachers to study hard, improve their ideological level, gradually learn to use the viewpoints of dialectical materialism and historical materialism and the method of linking theory with practice to teach, and pay attention to implementing political and ideological education in classroom teaching. This requires teachers to appropriately collect and use practical materials from national construction to enrich teaching content, and create conditions to make teaching aids and conduct intuitive teaching, so that students can conduct experiments and visits to consolidate and practice the knowledge they have learned. In teaching, attention should be paid to overcoming the problems of dogmatism and formalism in which theory is divorced from reality.
    To improve the teaching work of secondary schools, it is necessary to learn from and absorb the advanced educational theories and experiences of the Soviet Union. When learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, attention should be paid to understanding its essence and being good at combining it with China's actual conditions. School leaders should be good at leading teachers to steadily improve teaching work, opposing both passive conservatism and blind advancement; and strengthening leadership over teaching groups in various subjects.
    In order to improve the quality of teaching, the Central Ministry of Education should further revise secondary school teaching plans, teaching syllabuses, and textbooks in a planned way, from the perspective of dialectical materialism and historical materialism and the method of linking theory with practice, in accordance with the general task of the country during the transition period and the purpose of secondary education, and compile a set of teaching guides for teachers. This is the most basic work to improve the quality of school education at present.
    3. Pay attention to health education and enhance students' physical fitness. This is an inseparable part of all-round development education. The current poor health of students should arouse sufficient attention from all educators. Educational administrative leading organs at all levels should seriously check the implementation of the "Decision on Improving the Health of Students at All Levels of Schools" by the State Administrative Council of the Central People's Government by schools at all levels, and urge and guide schools to correct the tendency of neglecting the health of teachers and students, conscientiously implement this decision, and take effective measures to actively improve the health of teachers and students. In order to reduce the burden of schoolwork on students, the Central Ministry of Education should plan to appropriately streamline textbooks.
      4. Strengthening teachers' political, cultural, and professional learning has a decisive effect on improving teaching work and improving the quality of secondary education. In the future, educational administrative leading organs at all levels should effectively lead the on-the-job learning of teachers and include it as one of their work tasks. They should formulate plans for the on-the-job learning of middle school teachers in their localities according to local conditions, and establish an inspection system. The on-the-job learning of teachers should not be carried out in multiple directions at the same time, and the requirements should not be too urgent. The priorities should be determined, the urgency should be distinguished, and the plans should be carried out according to the different levels of teachers and the specific conditions of various places. When leading teachers to study, attention should be paid to guiding teachers to continue to deepen ideological remolding, criticize bourgeois ideas, and improve their socialist consciousness, especially to correctly understand the relationship between physical labor and mental labor, and correct the erroneous idea of ​​despising physical labor and despising physical laborers.
      Regarding the organizational forms of learning, all methods that have proven effective in various places, such as teacher training colleges, correspondence schools, teaching research associations, and periodic reports, should be promoted in combination with local conditions.
      5. Continue to improve school leadership work. The key to improving school leadership lies first in establishing the core of school leadership and giving play to the role of collective leadership. The principal should be fully responsible for the school's work, but must focus on leading teaching, making teaching work the central task of the school. It is necessary to be good at uniting and educating teachers, so that teachers can wholeheartedly work hard to educate the younger generation. For existing teachers, it is necessary to be good at helping them progress professionally and politically. It is necessary to be good at discovering and giving play to teachers' strengths and value their experience and creation. In the future, the number of young teachers newly graduated from schools will increase day by day. They all lack teaching experience. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the training and improvement of these new teachers, and mobilize old teachers to help train and improve these new teachers. The principal should have a democratic style, be good at consulting with teachers, and study teaching work. Attention should be paid to strengthening the unity of all teachers, especially the unity of new and old teachers. Teachers should respect each other, learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths, and make progress together. Care should be given to teachers' lives and health and efforts should be made to improve them.
      6. Educational administrative leading organs at all levels must further strengthen their leadership over secondary schools. At present, provincial (municipal) education departments (bureaus) should strengthen their leadership over secondary schools with their main strength. According to the principle of unified leadership and decentralized management, secondary schools in cities under the jurisdiction of provinces (municipalities) should be managed by cities under the jurisdiction of provinces (municipalities), and secondary schools in counties (cities) should also be gradually managed by counties (cities). All provinces (municipalities) must conscientiously run several secondary schools well, summarize and accumulate successful experiences, and promote them. This is an important method to improve leadership work at present. Educational administrative leading organs at all levels should focus on conducting in-depth inspections of secondary school education work, summarize experience, discover problems, solve problems, and provide specific guidance to various schools. In addition to improving school leaders through inspection, work summaries, and principal meetings, local authorities should plan to adopt the method of training them in batches and shifts to improve their political and professional level. Provinces (municipalities) should try their best to equip schools that still lack leadership backbone as soon as possible to improve school leadership.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于改进和发展中学教育的指示
    （一九五四年四月八日政务院第二百一十二次政务会议通过）
    中华人民共和国成立以来，全国中学教育，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，有了巨大的恢复和发展，并进行了一系列的改革，如增加工农成份、思想改造、教学改革、各少数民族学校用本族语言教学等。这些措施，基本上都是符合国家过渡时期总任务的精神的。一九五三年全国中学在校学生数已较一九四九年增加了百分之一百八十五，大大超过了旧中国历史上的最高数量；一九五三年学生中工农子女已占学生总数的百分之五十七点三，女生数也在不断增加；教材已初步有所改革，教育方法也开始有所改进；在学校教育中工人阶级思想已取得领导地位，师生的思想有显著的进步；学生的知识水平亦在逐渐提高。这些成就，为我国中学教育进一步的发展与提高奠定了基础。四年来，全国高级中学毕业了二十一万六千余人，初级中学毕业了一百零五万五千余人，为国家培养建设人材作了很大的贡献，并开始为生产战线提供了一部分具有一定政治觉悟和文化水平的新生力量。全国中学校的教职员，四年来为教育青年一代作了很大的努力，对国家对人民是有功绩的。但另一方面，目前中学教育仍存在不少问题、缺点和错误，主要的是高级中学还不能供应高等学校以足够的合格的学生；学生的政治觉悟和文化水平都不够高，体质还不够健康；教学计划和教材还不够切合实际；教师数量不足，质量也不够高；有些学校还缺乏领导骨干，学校的政治思想工作还差；对团结教师的工作注意不够。产生这些缺点和错误的原因，主要由于教育行政领导机关对于中学教育的政治思想领导薄弱，没有明确地阐明中学教育的性质和任务，特别严重的是忽视了劳动教育，对于旧社会学校教育中流行的轻视体力劳动和工农劳动人民的剥削阶级思想，没有进行系统的深刻的批判，这是一个原则性的错误。为了进一步改进和发展中学教育，特作如下指示：
    一、中学教育的目的，是以社会主义思想教育学生，培养他们成为社会主义社会全面发展的成员。中学教育不仅要供应高等学校以足够的合格的新生，并且还要供应国家生产建设以具有一定政治觉悟、文化教养和健康体质的新生力量。因此中学毕业生，除部分根据国家需要升学外，大部分应该积极从事工农业生产劳动或其他建设工作。
    二、当前中学教育的工作方针应是：按照国家过渡时期的总任务，在整顿巩固的基础上，根据需要与可能，作有计划有重点的发展，并积极地稳步地提高中学教育的质量，特别是要办好高级中学、完全中学和工农速成中学。中学教育的发展，是着重发展高级中学，初级中学也要依据可能条件作适当的发展。当前发展中学，既不能消极保守，也不能盲目冒进，应实事求是地制定发展计划，并注意发挥潜力，创造条件，积极克服发展中的困难。
    三、中学必须贯彻全面发展的教育。由于过去对全面发展的教育认识不足，有很多学校对学生的身体健康问题一直是不注意的，并曾因强调政治思想教育而忽视科学知识的教学；最近又有不少学校因重视科学知识的教学而放松政治思想教育，这些顾此失彼的片面作法，都是不对的，必须予以纠正。今后我们的中学教育，既要加强政治思想教育，又要重视系统的科学知识的教学，同时还要注意体育卫生教育。
    1、政治思想教育的任务，是树立社会主义的政治方向，培养辩证唯物论世界观的基础和共产主义的道德。为此，必须在中学里巩固和加强工人阶级思想的领导地位，增强社会主义思想，彻底批判资产阶级思想和继续肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想残余。
    政治思想教育，应根据学生现存的思想情况，继续努力培养“爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物”的国民公德，并注意培养集体主义精神，自觉的纪律，及坚韧、勇敢、谦逊、诚实、节俭、朴素等品质。目前应特别着重加强爱国主义教育、劳动教育和自觉纪律教育。
    关于爱国主义教育，是要培养学生对祖国的热爱和献身于祖国社会主义建设事业的志愿，加强国家观念，树立个人利益服从国家利益的观念。进行爱国主义教育的同时，应注意培养国际主义的精神。
    关于劳动教育，是要培养学生的社会主义劳动观点，将劳动看作是光荣的事业，热爱劳动，对劳动具有自觉的积极的态度；纠正轻视体力劳动、轻视工农体力劳动者的错误思想。在学校教育中，应当配合着课堂教学，适当组织学生作一些力所能及的有教育意义的体力劳动。
    关于自觉纪律教育，是要培养学生学习的自觉性与积极性，自觉地遵守学校规则，尊敬教师，爱护学校财物，维护学校秩序，尊重集体利益，并培养遵守社会秩序和国家法律的思想。目前有些学校中纪律松弛的现象，必须认真加以克服。
    政治思想教育，主要依靠教师通过课内各科教学和课外各种活动来进行。因此在课内课外，都应根据青年的特点，从正面积极地以社会主义思想来武装学生。说服是政治思想教育的基本方法。对学生的良好行为，应予以表扬鼓励。对学生的错误思想行为，既不能放任自流，也不能采用简单的粗暴的方式方法来处理，应该是循循善诱，启发觉悟，进行适当批评，帮助他们努力改正。如有必要采取适当处罚时，亦作为教育的补助方法，并须注意防止惩办主义偏向。青年团和少先队应协助学校进行政治思想教育。
    2、改进教学，以先进的科学知识武装学生。这首先要求教师努力钻研教材，深刻领会和掌握自己所教学科的教学目的、思想内容和科学内容，相应地改进教学方法，以求正确地系统地进行教学。这就要求教师努力学习，提高自己的思想水平，逐步学会运用辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的观点和理论与实际联系的方法来讲课，并在课堂教学中注意贯彻政治思想教育。这就要求教师适当地搜集、采用国家建设的实际材料来充实教学内容，并创造条件，制造教具，进行直观教学，使学生能作实验和参观，以巩固和练习运用所学知识。在教学中要注意克服理论脱离实际的教条主义和形式主义毛病。
    改进中学的教学工作，必须学习和吸收苏联的先进教育理论与教育经验。学习苏联的先进经验，要注意领会其实质，善于把它和中国的实际情况结合起来。学校领导干部应善于领导教师稳步地改进教学工作，既反对消极保守，又反对盲目冒进；对各科教学小组应加强领导。
    为提高教学质量，中央教育部应根据国家过渡时期的总任务和中学教育的目的，进一步以辩证唯物论与历史唯物论的观点和理论与实际联系的方法，有计划地修订中学教学计划，修改教学大纲和教科书，并为教师编辑一套教学指导书，这是目前提高学校教育质量的一项最基本的工作。
    3、注意健康教育，增强学生的体质，这是全面发展教育不可分割的内容之一。当前学生健康状况不够好，应引起全体教育工作者的足够重视。各级教育行政领导机关应认真检查各级学校对中央人民政府政务院“关于改善各级学校学生健康状况的决定”的执行情况，并督促指导学校纠正忽视师生健康的偏向，切实执行这一决定，采取有效办法积极改善师生健康。为了减轻学生的课业负担，中央教育部应有计划地适当地精简教材。
      四、加强教师政治、文化与业务学习，对改进教学工作提高中学教育质量是有决定作用的。今后各级教育行政领导机关应把在职教师的学习切实领导起来，列为工作任务之一；应根据当地情况，制定本地中学教师在职学习的计划，并建立检查制度。教师的在职学习，不宜多头并进，要求过急，应根据教师的不同程度和各地具体条件，确定主次，分清缓急，有计划地进行。在领导教师学习时，应注意引导教师继续深入思想改造，批判资产阶级思想，提高社会主义的觉悟，特别要正确认识体力劳动和智力劳动的关系，纠正轻视体力劳动和轻视体力劳动者的错误思想。
      关于学习的组织形式，凡各地已行之有效的，如教师进修学院、函授学校、教学研究会、定期报告等方式，均应结合当地情况，予以推广。
      五、继续改进学校领导工作。改进学校领导的关键，首先在于建立学校领导核心，发挥集体领导作用，校长对学校工作应全面负责，但必须以领导教学为中心，使教学工作成为学校的中心任务。必须善于团结和教育教师，使教师全心全意为教育青年一代而努力。对原有教师，要善于从业务上、政治上帮助他们进步。要善于发现和发挥教师的长处，重视他们的经验与创造。今后新从学校毕业的青年教师日益增多，他们都缺乏教学经验，因此，必须重视对这些新教师的培养和提高，要动员老教师来帮助训练和提高这些新教师。校长要有民主作风，善于和教师商量问题，研究教学工作。应注意加强全体教师的团结，特别是新、老教师的团结。教师应互相尊重，互相学习，取长补短，共同进步。对教师的生活和健康应予关心并设法改善。
      六、各级教育行政领导机关必须进一步加强对中学的领导。目前省（市）教育厅（局）应以主要力量加强对中学的领导。按统一领导、分级管理的原则，省辖市内的中学由省辖市管理，县（市）内的中学亦应逐步做到由县（市）管理。各省（市）都必须切实办好几所中学，总结和积累成功的经验，加以推广，这是目前改进领导工作的一个重要方法。各级教育行政领导机关对中学教育工作，应重点深入进行检查，总结经验，发现问题，解决问题，给各校以具体指导。对学校领导干部，除在经常工作中通过检查工作、总结工作以及校长会议等方式予以提高外，各地应有计划地采取分批轮训的办法，提高他们的政治与业务水平，现在尚缺领导骨干的学校，各省（市）应尽速设法配齐，以健全学校领导。
