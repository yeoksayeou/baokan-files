Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 12th (TASS):

Dear Comrades, Friends!

Please allow me, following the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to extend to you, and through you to the glorious Czechoslovak Communist Party, heartfelt congratulations and express the sincere, fraternal love and friendship that the Soviet people cherish for the Czechoslovak people.
  (A storm of prolonged applause, turning into cheers)

Let me extend warm congratulations to the working people of Prague, the beautiful capital of the Czech and Slovak nations. (Applause) This city is one of the oldest in Europe, renowned since time immemorial for its highly developed culture, and praised in magnificent, freedom-loving folk songs.

For us Communists, Prague holds particular significance. Forty-two years ago, the Russian Bolsheviks, under the leadership of the founder of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the great Lenin, held a conference in Prague that purged its ranks of opportunists, laying the foundation for the Bolsheviks to finally form an independent, revolutionary workers' party, a new type of Leninist party. (Applause) This was not only a major event in the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The resolutions of the Bolshevik Prague Conference set an example of uncompromising struggle against opportunism, and helped to establish and strengthen Marxist workers' parties in many countries—loyal and resolute defenders of the interests of the working masses.

Comrades, the Czechoslovak Communist Party is now holding its Tenth Congress, more united and stronger than ever before. It has gained rich, thirty-plus years of experience in the struggle for national independence, for the freedom of the Czech and Slovak nations, and for the victory of the socialist cause. It was for this noble cause that Klement Gottwald, the faithful son of the Czechoslovak people and an outstanding activist in the international revolutionary movement, dedicated his life and all his energy. (Applause)

The Czechoslovak Communist Party has consistently defended the vital interests of the working class, the interests of the working people, and has won the full trust and support of the people through its selfless struggle.

During the period between the First and Second World Wars, your party led the revolutionary struggle of the Czechoslovak working class and working peasants against the bourgeoisie. During the difficult years of Hitler's occupation, the Communist Party was the true organizer and leader of the struggle of the working masses for the liberation of the motherland from the fascist yoke.

Czechoslovak Communists fought heroically for the freedom of their people and won immortal glory. All freedom-loving people throughout the world know and respect the glorious names of Julius Fučík and Jan Šverma. Communists always stood at the forefront of the courageous warriors fighting to liberate their homeland from the vile German fascist occupation. (Applause)

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the working people of Czechoslovakia ended the rule of the bourgeoisie, liberated their country from the domination of reactionary classes, abolished the rule of foreign capitalists, and established a people's democratic political and social system, thereby establishing a truly people's power headed by the working class.

The Czechoslovak people have reason to be proud of their historically significant achievements. The People's Republic of Czechoslovakia has embarked on the bright road of socialist construction and is moving forward with confidence. Socialist positions are constantly being consolidated in industry, domestic and foreign trade. Overcoming difficulties and the resistance of enemies, the Czechoslovak working people have successfully completed the two-year plan for restoring the national economy and the five-year plan for developing the republic's economy and culture.

During the period of the five-year plan from 1949 to 1953, total industrial output more than doubled, and labor productivity increased by sixty percent. During the same period, industrial production in Slovakia increased more than two and a half times, that is, four and a half times the pre-war level.

The Czechoslovak Communist Party has set itself a very important goal—to unswervingly ensure the continuous improvement of the people's welfare, and for this purpose to pay more attention to the development of agriculture.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union sincerely wishes you victory in your work to further increase agricultural production, so as to greatly improve the supply to the residents, supplying them with all the necessary food, especially bread, meat, fats, dairy products, and other products. In this regard, the Czechoslovak Republic has great potential.

What is needed to continuously and rapidly develop agriculture? First of all, it is necessary to expand the scope of mechanization and supply the republic's agriculture with the necessary number of tractors, plows, seeders, combine harvesters, especially grain harvesters and beet diggers, so as to mechanize agricultural labor to a greater extent. Only through the comprehensive mechanization of agricultural production is it possible to alleviate the labor of farmers, increase the efficiency of farmers' labor, and provide farmers with the conditions for further cultural development. It is only possible to improve the level of mechanization in the large-scale cooperative farms that now unite the advanced sections of Czechoslovak farmers. The issue of cooperative farmers forming agricultural cooperatives is not only a matter of increasing agricultural productivity, but also a matter of alleviating farmers' labor and attracting more and more farmers, especially women, to actively participate in social life and state management. There is no doubt that unified agricultural cooperatives will continue to develop and consolidate, will achieve higher yields, and will set an example for all farmers.

The working farmers of Czechoslovakia will learn from the experience of existing unified agricultural cooperatives and thus know the benefits of cooperative farming, and they will adopt the policy of developing agriculture in the direction of cooperation.

The cooperation of farm households is entirely based on the principle of full compliance with voluntary participation, and this cooperation also means that more attention and help needs to be given to individual farm households, which is entirely reasonable.

The industrial progress made by Czechoslovakia, which has always been known for its high industrial efficiency, is a necessary condition for the continuous and rapid development of agriculture and for increasing the working class's assistance to unified agricultural cooperatives and the entire working peasantry. The farmers of Czechoslovakia know how to achieve good results in crop and animal husbandry production, and they are currently contributing, and will undoubtedly continue to contribute in a much larger scale, to the cause of socialist construction.

Only with the fraternal support of the working class can the working farmers complete their tasks in agricultural production. Workers, peasants, and intellectuals are all equally concerned about the cause of building a new socialist society, because this society will guarantee the continuous development of national productive forces and the continuous improvement of the material and cultural level of the people. To establish a socialist system, a strong social force is needed. This force exists. As Marxism-Leninism points out, this force is the alliance of workers and peasants. Workers and peasants constitute the vast majority of the residents, and it is they who create all the major wealth of life. If they take the cause of socialist transformation of society into their own hands, then they will not be afraid of capitalists, landlords, and any counter-revolutionaries. (Applause) The experience of the Soviet Union and the experience of the people's democratic countries clearly show that whether this cause can be victorious depends on maintaining correct economic and political relations between urban and rural areas, and on the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class.

History proves that the road of fraternal alliance between workers and peasants pointed out by Lenin, the road of economic exchange between urban and rural areas, is entirely correct. This is the only possible and correct road to socialist victory. The alliance of the working class and the peasantry is the unbreakable foundation of the people's democratic system. We warmly congratulate you on achieving new successes in the cause of further strengthening this alliance. (Applause)

The greatest achievement of the Czechoslovak people is that they created a free and independent people's democratic country. This historic victory is the result of the national liberation struggle of the Czech and Slovak nations for many centuries. The activities of the advanced children and outstanding figures of the Czech and Slovak nations are inextricably linked to this struggle. The development of Czechoslovak national culture is also linked to this struggle. The ideas of national liberation and social liberation nourished the creativity of the people. This idea is threaded through the works of many outstanding Czech and Slovak writers, artists, and composers. The Czechoslovak people have the right to be proud that they have made a great contribution to the development of world culture.

The great October Socialist Revolution in Russia aroused a powerful upsurge in national liberation movements and revolutionary movements in various countries. Under the favorable influence of the Russian socialist revolution, the Czechoslovak nations strengthened their struggle for freedom and independence. The Czechoslovak Republic was established in 1918. However, the exploiting classes seized the state power. Czechoslovakia's economy, its domestic and foreign policies were subordinate to the interests of foreign imperialists. At that time, with the power belonging to the bourgeoisie, Czechoslovakia did not and could not have independence. The history of the Czechoslovak bourgeois republic between the two world wars clearly proves this. The big shots of Western capitalist countries verbally advocated friendship with the Czechoslovak Republic, but in reality, they regarded it as an object of exploitation and an important strategic base for realizing their plunderous purposes.

The true attitude of the Western bourgeois countries towards Czechoslovakia was revealed in the shameful days of the Munich betrayal in 1938. The rulers of capitalist countries, governed by their imperialist interests, actually handed Czechoslovakia over to the fascist jackals to trample upon. Only the Soviet Union remained true to the treaty it had signed with Czechoslovakia. (Stormy, prolonged applause. All stand. Delegates rhythmically chant in unison: Long live the Soviet Union! And shout: Ura!) Our armed forces were ready to come to the aid of Czechoslovakia to fulfill its responsibilities. However, the bourgeois government of Czechoslovakia at that time rejected the Soviet government's proposal for assistance. In addition, the reactionary government of Poland also refused to allow Soviet troops to pass through Polish territory. The Czechoslovak people are convinced that within the framework of the bourgeois republic, when the exploiters are still in power, complete national independence and consolidated independent autonomy cannot be achieved.

It was only after the victory of the people's democratic system, after the people themselves became masters of the country, that a truly independent country—a truly people's Czechoslovak Republic—was established.

With the power belonging to the people, the great principles of equality and friendship among free nations can be truly realized. Unlike the situation in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where the Czech and Slovak nations were forced to participate in a tattered empire full of national disputes that eventually collapsed, now in the people's Czechoslovakia, the Czech and Slovak nations and other nations have united into a unified, truly democratic country, and they have established brotherly relations of friendship and cooperation. In strengthening and developing their beloved country, the Czechoslovak nations have increasingly realized how great is the vitality of the friendship and brotherly relations of various free and equal nations under the democratic system. (Applause)

The Soviet people are overjoyed by the brilliant victory of the Czechoslovak people and consider this victory to be a great contribution to the common cause of the entire democratic camp in the struggle for peace and friendship among all nations.

The Soviet working people praise the heroic history of the Czechoslovak people's struggle for freedom and greatly respect the progressive national traditions of the Czech and Slovak people.

We are very pleased that from ancient times to the present, the relations between our two peoples have been built on the basis of sincere and warm friendship. During the years of the Second World War, the friendship between the Soviet and Czechoslovak peoples was particularly consolidated. We also remember the many battles in Sokolovo, Belaya Tserkov, Zhytomyr, and other Soviet cities and villages, in which Soviet and Czechoslovak troops fought side by side against the common enemy. (Applause)

The Soviet people remember that the heroic Czechoslovak troops participated with our glorious Soviet army in the battle to liberate Kiev, the capital of Soviet Ukraine, the ancient city. I am particularly pleased when I recall the selfless battles fought by the sons of the Czechoslovak people, who were initially a brigade, and later a Czechoslovak corps, fighting first on the Voronezh front, and later on the First Ukrainian Front, when I was entrusted by our party to serve as a member of the front military council there. I have seen the Czechoslovak troops in action more than once, so I am very clear about their heroic fighting. (Applause) Czechoslovak guerrillas and Soviet guerrillas fought heroically together against the occupiers. In the struggle against our common enemy, the Czechoslovak troops gained immortal glory.

In the mountains of Slovakia, in the streets and squares of Prague, in the basins of the Hron River, Váh River, Vltava River, and Labe River, and in the fields and forests of Czechoslovakia, are scattered the blood of Czech, Slovak, and Soviet soldiers, who fought together for the honor, freedom, and independence of our two peoples. (Applause)

In the post-war period, the friendship between the Soviet and Czechoslovak peoples has developed and consolidated even more powerfully. During this period, the working people of the Czechoslovak Republic, who had broken the shackles of Hitlerism, with the fraternal help of the Soviet people, and hand in hand with the working people of other people's democratic countries, began to lay the foundations of socialism.

The economic and cultural ties between our two countries are expanding and consolidating day by day. The most precious thing in the relations between the Czechoslovak Republic and the Soviet Union is the friendship between our two peoples. The friendship between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, tempered in the flames of the liberation war, is unbreakable. (Prolonged applause)

The working people of Czechoslovakia can be confident that the Soviet Union will always be your reliable friend, and it will continue to do its utmost to provide multifaceted assistance and support in your struggle to consolidate the people's democratic system and further consolidate and develop your country. (Stormy applause, turning into cheers. All stand and shout: Long live the Soviet Union!) The close economic, political, and cultural cooperation between Czechoslovakia and the various democratic countries of the democratic camp provides the necessary conditions for it to continuously develop its national economy and culture, and for the first time in the history of Czechoslovakia, its national sovereignty and national independence have been supported and guaranteed. (Applause)

The mutual relations between the Soviet Union and the various people's democratic countries are based on mutual full respect, true equality, and fraternal mutual assistance. The working people of the various people's democratic countries understand that as long as the friendship between the socialist camp countries exists and grows, no enemy can take away from the people of these countries the great fruits of their victory. (Applause) Our sacred task is to protect and consolidate the friendship between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, and to consolidate the friendship and cooperation between all people's democratic countries. This is the source of our strength and the guarantee of our invincibility. (Prolonged applause) There is no doubt that despite the enemies' various conspiracies, this friendship will continue to consolidate and develop for the happiness of our two peoples. (Stormy applause)

The people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the various people's democratic countries are engaged in constructive labor and are therefore deeply concerned about defending and consolidating world peace. The governments of our countries have consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy, advocating the expansion and consolidation of business ties on the basis of mutual benefit.

In this regard, our starting point is that the two different social systems of socialism and capitalism can coexist peacefully for a long time. The countries of the democratic camp pursue a peaceful foreign policy, striving to ease international tensions; develop business ties and trade with all countries willing to develop business ties and trade, and further consolidate world peace.

The whole world knows that we hope to expand economic and cultural ties between all nations and ease international tensions. The Soviet Union sincerely hopes to prevent a new war and defend peace. There are many proofs of this. The Soviet Union has promulgated and is implementing a law that stipulates severe punishment for war propaganda and warmongering; the Soviet Union has shown initiative in stopping the Korean War; we have proposed making a solemn guarantee not to use atomic weapons, and then reaching an agreement on completely prohibiting the use of such weapons of mass destruction of humanity; the proposal to substantially reduce standing armies was also put forward by us. At the Berlin Conference, the Soviet Union did everything possible to strive to ease international tensions and resolve European issues. Now, at the Geneva Conference, representatives of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are striving to restore peace in Indochina, fairly resolve the Korean issue, and thus consolidate the position of peace. (Applause)

However, everyone also sees that many officials in the United States are inciting an atmosphere of war and openly clamoring to launch a new war. Nolan, the leader of the majority party in the US Senate, is one of these advocates of war. He opposes the peaceful resolution of international issues and clamors for a centralized strike against the Soviet Union. Isn't it obvious that this clamor is not conducive to the peaceful resolution of international issues?

The imperialist and reactionary camp is full of internal contradictions. In various capitalist countries, the number of unemployed is increasing day by day, the material conditions of the working masses are deteriorating day by day, and internal economic difficulties are becoming increasingly serious. The imperialists are attempting to overcome all these contradictions by frantically expanding armaments and intensifying the exploitation of the working class and working peasants. It is precisely for this reason that the United States is inciting war hysteria and spending huge sums of money to expand armaments. Even the bourgeois newspapers cannot hide their concern about the fact that the rampant new war propagandists are turning the United States into a police and fascist state.

Not long ago, an editorial in the US "Stone Weekly" said:

"Washington is shrouded in an atmosphere where few members of Congress dare to come out against turning their country into a police state, against waging war abroad, because they are afraid of being accused of supporting communism. We are moving towards war and fascism, although only a small handful of madmen want war and fascism... Our great country, like a flock of sheep being driven by a few rabid dogs, is being led to disaster. There have rarely been such examples in history where free people have had less right to handle their own destiny than they do now."

This is the hysterical atmosphere that the American imperialists are creating. And all of this is to extract maximum profits and to further enslave the working people.

The American imperialists, who conspire to establish world hegemony, are trying to convince people that in our era, the national sovereignty of large countries, especially small countries, is a legacy of the past. They portray themselves as peaceful "defenders" while seizing the economies of Western European countries and other countries; turning these countries into their dependencies; and cultivating pro-American regimes in these countries. They are suppressing people's good wishes - love for their own motherland, for the freedom and national independence of their motherland.

It is understandable that the imperialists harbor extreme hatred for the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The people of these countries have taken power into their own hands, established democratic systems, and do not allow the United States and other imperialists to run rampant in the people's democratic countries. The imperialists will not be reconciled to this.

Facts show that some ruling groups in imperialist countries are still unwilling to give up their illusions, stubbornly believing that the notorious policy of strength can intimidate us.

As for the Soviet Union, we have always responded to the threats of the imperialist big shots, and the Soviet people have never been afraid of any threats. (Applause) It is not a novelty to use threats against the Soviet people. Everyone knows that Hitler also attempted to defeat the Soviet Union by force. But everyone still remembers that the result was the death of Hitler and his accomplices. Our people clearly understand their own strength, and if they are forced to, they can defeat any aggressor. (Stormy applause) Moreover, the various people's democratic countries are not what they used to be. They have grown stronger and more consolidated, and if attacked, they will not suffer any losses and will be able to defend their fruits. (Prolonged applause)

We have ample reason to say that the powerful democratic and socialist camp, united by firm friendship and composed of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the Czechoslovak Republic, and other people's democratic countries, is capable of giving the warmongers who are playing with fire a worthy rebuff. (Applause) If the imperialists launch a new, Third World War, then they will drown in this war, which will end with the great collapse of the capitalist world. (Prolonged applause)

The people of the democratic camp have won their freedom and national independence in the extremely cruel struggle against fascist and reactionary forces. They have won the right to kick away the capitalists and other exploiters and build a better life. They will never give up these fruits of victory. (Applause)

The Czechoslovak people have for many centuries suffered from the oppression of German landlords and capitalists who threatened their national survival. The Czechoslovak people have waged a selfless struggle against them. The freedom and independence of the people's democratic Czechoslovak state, its right to build a new socialist life, were obtained at a high price - the blood and lives of many outstanding sons and daughters of the Czechoslovak people. Can the Czechoslovak people agree to the policy of reviving German imperialism pursued by the American ruling groups and their European partners? It is clear that the Czechoslovak people, who have suffered enormous hardships caused by German fascists, will not agree to do so. The Czechoslovak people are fighting for European security and are working hand in hand with the Soviet people, the various people's democratic countries, and all people who uphold world peace. (Applause)

Responsibility to humanity requires all peace advocates to stop the outbreak of a new war and smash the plans of the aggressive groups, so that - in the words of the famous Czech writer Karel Čapek - we do not let the poisonous snakes release poison, and do not let tigers and wolves bare their teeth and claws.

There are healthy forces in the world, and they constitute the vast majority. This force is the masses of the people. They stand on the position of consolidating peace and are stopping the aggressors who are attempting to launch a new war. Progressive forces are not only active in Europe, but also in the Americas and in every corner of the world. The urgent task of all peaceful forces is to struggle for consolidating European security, establishing lasting peace in Asia, stopping any aggression by imperialism, unconditionally prohibiting the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, further easing international tensions, and improving friendly relations between all nations and all countries.

Comrades! The Tenth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party is solving major tasks. It is summarizing the work of the party in the five years since the Ninth Congress and pointing out the path for further building the foundations of socialism in free and democratic Czechoslovakia. The modern history of your country and the work of this congress prove that the Czechoslovak Communist Party is the recognized leader and long-tested leader of the Czechoslovak people. Based on their many years of experience, they believe that all the activities of the Communist Party are for the happiness of the people and are entirely based on the interests of the people. The party is worthy of the trust and support of the people. For example, the victory won by the candidates of the Czech and Slovak National Front under the leadership of the Communist Party in the recent elections of local people's political power organs - the People's Councils - vividly proves this point. This election once again showed that the Czechoslovak working people are united around their Communist Party. As early as 1921, when talking about the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the great Lenin pointed out that it is necessary to attract the majority of the working people to the side of the party, and it is necessary to continue to recruit workers into the party in order to build an invincible force.

The Czechoslovak Communist Party has now become a truly great force. It has gained the trust of the Czechoslovak working people and has won the respect and love of the various fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties. It has been able to do so because it has always been loyal to the vital interests of its own people and loyal to the ever-victorious doctrine of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin. The Czechoslovak Communist Party has constantly waged a tenacious struggle for the purity and unity of its ranks. As early as the era of the bourgeois republic, it smashed and purged the right and left opportunists, Trotskyists, and other enemies of the party and the people. In recent years, the party has exposed the despicable agents of the imperialist bourgeoisie who had infiltrated the party's ranks.

In the process of consolidating the people's democratic country, the Czechoslovak Communist Party has become a mass party, uniting the best and most advanced forces among the people in its ranks. Marxist-Leninism teaches us that the strength of the revolutionary party of the working class lies in the unity of its ranks, in the political training of the party's cadres and all party members, and in their correct understanding of the party's policies. Therefore, the most important task of the Communist Party is to carry out meticulous and persistent education of party members who have joined the party's ranks from various different strata of residents, to educate them to have Marxist-Leninist party spirit, so as to make the party more united. As the experience of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries shows, educating and training the party activists who make up the huge core of the party is of particular importance. The vast number of party activists united around the Party Central Committee, if they are constantly worked on, are a huge organizational force for realizing the tasks put forward by the party. (Applause)

There is no doubt that the Czechoslovak Communist Party will continue to constantly and sacredly maintain the purity of the party, consolidate the fighting unity of the party's ranks, improve political vigilance, carry out criticism and self-criticism within the party, adhere to the principle of collective leadership, and consolidate the ties with the people - the working class, the working peasants, and the intellectuals. The Czechoslovak Communist Party constantly cares about the happiness of the people, and will certainly guarantee the continuous development of the national economy, the development of agriculture, and the improvement of labor productivity. This enables the Communist Party and the government of the Czechoslovak Republic to victoriously implement the policy of planned price reductions and more fully meeting the growing material and spiritual needs of the people.

The experience of the world communist movement teaches us that the revolutionary party of the proletariat is invincible if it can rely on the people, follow the Marxist-Leninist theory in its activities, and apply this theory creatively to the specific historical situation and the conditions of its own country.

Let me congratulate your congress on its achievements and fruitful work. Your congress is a major event in the life of Czechoslovakia.

The resolutions of the Tenth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party will make the party more closely united, further enhance the role of collective leadership, and determine the path for the Czechoslovak Republic to move towards socialism in the future.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has entrusted our delegation to convey the following congratulatory message to the Tenth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party:

"To the Tenth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party:

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union extends brotherly greetings to the Tenth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. (Stormy, prolonged applause, turning into cheers. Delegates all stand to listen to the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.)

Relying on the trust and support of the broad masses of working people, the Czechoslovak Communist Party has achieved great success in consolidating the people's democratic country and building the foundations of socialism. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, Czechoslovakia has victoriously completed the first five-year plan for developing the national economy and has created the necessary preconditions for greatly developing agriculture and improving the living standards of the working people. People's Czechoslovakia is an active fighter for the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union sincerely wishes the Czechoslovak Communist Party and all the working people new achievements in the struggle for socialist construction, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and consolidating the fraternal friendship between the various nations of Czechoslovakia, developing the national economy and culture, continuously improving the living standards of the working people, and strengthening world peace.

Long live the vanguard of the working class and all the working people of Czechoslovakia - the Czechoslovak Communist Party!

Long live the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union!

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"

(The hall resounds with a stormy, prolonged cheer. Delegates shout: "Long live the Soviet Union!" "Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union!" "Long live peace!" "Eternal friendship with the Soviet Union!" Shout: "Ura!" Delegates and guests sing "The Internationale".)

### 在捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会上  赫鲁晓夫同志的演说

专栏：

    在捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会上
    赫鲁晓夫同志的演说亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    请允许我遵照苏联共产党中央委员会的指示，向你们、并通过你们向光荣的捷克斯洛伐克共产党致以衷心的祝贺，并表达苏联人民对捷克斯洛伐克人民所怀抱的诚挚的、兄弟般的敬爱和友谊的感情。
  （暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声，继而转为欢呼）
    让我向捷克民族和斯洛伐克民族的美丽的首都——布拉格的劳动人民表示热烈的祝贺。（掌声）这个城市是欧洲最古老的城市之一，它从不可记忆的年代起就以高度发达的文化著称，并在雄壮的、爱好自由的民歌中受到赞美。
    对于我们共产党人说来，布拉格是有特别重要的意义的。四十二年前，俄国的布尔什维克在苏联共产党的缔造者、伟大的列宁的领导下在布拉格举行了一次会议，清除了它的队伍中的机会主义者，为布尔什维克最后组成一个独立的、革命的、工人政党、组成一个新型的列宁主义的政党打下了基础。（掌声）这不仅是苏联共产党历史上的一个重大事件。布尔什维克布拉格会议的决议树立了对机会主义进行不调和的斗争的榜样，并帮助建立和加强了许多国家中的马克思主义的工人政党——劳动群众利益的忠实的、坚决的捍卫者。
    同志们，捷克斯洛伐克共产党现在举行第十次代表大会，它比从前更加团结、更加坚强了。它在争取国家的独立、争取捷克和斯洛伐克两民族的自由、争取社会主义事业的胜利的斗争中有了丰富的、三十多年的经验。就是为了这个崇高的事业，捷克斯洛伐克人民的忠实儿子、国际革命运动的杰出的活动家克利门特·哥特瓦尔德贡献了他的一生，贡献了他的全部精力。（掌声）
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党始终不渝地捍卫工人阶级的切身利益、劳动人民的利益，并且以它的忘我的斗争赢得了人民的充分信任和支持。
    在第一次和第二次世界大战之间的时期中，你们的党领导了捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级和劳动农民的反对资产阶级的革命斗争。在希特勒占领的艰苦年代中，共产党是劳动群众争取祖国从法西斯枷锁下获得解放的斗争的真正的组织者和领导者。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党员英勇地为他们人民的自由而斗争，并且获得了不朽的光荣。全世界所有爱好自由的人民都知道并尊敬尤利乌斯·伏契克和扬·斯维尔玛的光荣的名字。共产党员永远站在争取把他们的祖国从万恶的德国法西斯占领下解放出来的勇敢的战士的前列。（掌声）
    在共产党的领导下，捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民结束了资产阶级的统治，把他们的国家从反动阶级的统治下解放了出来，取消了外国资本家的统治并且建立了人民民主的政治和社会制度，从而建立了以工人阶级为首的真正的人民政权。
      捷克斯洛伐克人民有理由为他们的具有历史意义的成就而骄傲。人民的捷克斯洛伐克共和国走上了光明的社会主义建设大道，并且正在满怀信心地前进。在工业及国内和对外贸易中，社会主义阵地在不断地巩固。捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民克服了困难和敌人的反抗，已经胜利地完成了恢复国民经济的两年计划和发展共和国的经济和文化的五年计划。
    在一九四九年到一九五三年五年计划的时期中，工业总产量增加了一倍以上，劳动生产率提高了百分之六十。在同时期中，斯洛伐克的工业生产量增为二倍半以上，即增为战前水平的四倍半。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党为自己规定了一个非常重要的目标——坚持不渝地使人民的福利不断地增进，并为此更注意农业的发展。
    苏联共产党谨祝你们在进一步提高农业生产工作中取得胜利，以便大大改进对居民的供应，供应他们一切必需的食品，首先是面包、肉类、脂肪、奶类等这些产品。在这方面，捷克斯洛伐克共和国有很大的潜力。
    要不断地并迅速地发展农业需要什么呢？首先需要扩大机械化的范围并供应共和国农业以必要数目的拖拉机、犁、播种机、收割联合机、特别是谷物收割机和甜菜挖掘机，以使农业劳动在更大的程度上机械化。只有通过农业生产的全面机械化，才有可能减轻农民的劳动，使农民劳动的效率提高并供给农民以进一步发展文化的条件。只有在现在已把捷克斯洛伐克农民先进部分团结起来的大规模的合作农庄中才能做到提高机械化水平。合作农民成立农庄的问题不仅是提高农业生产率的问题，而且是减轻农民劳动和吸引愈来愈多的农民特别是妇女积极参加社会生活和国家管理工作的问题。毫无疑问，统一农业合作社将继续发展和巩固，将获得更高的收获量并为全体农民树立一个榜样。
    捷克斯洛伐克的劳动农民将吸取现有统一农业合作社的经验从而知道合作耕种的好处，他们将采取朝合作方向发展农业的方针。
    农户的合作完全以充分遵守自愿参加的原则为基础，这种合作还意味着需要给予个体农户以更多的注意和帮助，这是十分合理的。
    一直以很高的工业效率著称的捷克斯洛伐克所取得的工业进展，是不断地和更迅速地发展农业、增加工人阶级对统一农业合作社和整个劳动农民的帮助的必要条件。捷克斯洛伐克的农民知道如何在农作物和畜牧业生产方面取得良好的成绩，他们目前正在、而且无疑地将来还会在大得多的规模上对社会主义建设事业作出贡献。
    只是由于工人阶级的兄弟般的支持，劳动农民才能在农业生产中完成他们的任务。工人、农民和知识分子都同样关怀建设一个新的社会主义社会的事业，因为这个社会将保证国家生产力的不断发展和人民的物质和文化水平的不断提高。要建立社会主义制度，就需要有强大的社会力量。这种力量是有的。正如马克思列宁主义所指出的，这种力量就是工人和农民的联盟。工人和农民占居民中的绝大多数，是他们在创造全部主要的生活财富，如果他们把对社会实行社会主义改造的事业掌握在自己手中，那么他们就不怕资本家、地主和任何反革命分子。（鼓掌）苏联的经验、人民民主国家的经验明显地表明，这一事业能否胜利，依赖于城乡在经济和政治上保持正确的关系，依赖于以工人阶级为领导的工农联盟。
    历史证明，列宁所指出的工农兄弟般的联盟的道路，城乡经济交流的道路是完全正确的，这是社会主义胜利的唯一可能的和正确的道路。工人阶级和农民的联盟是人民民主制度牢不可破的基础。我们热烈地祝贺你们在进一步加强这一联盟的事业中取得新的成就。（鼓掌）
    捷克斯洛伐克人民的最伟大的成果就是他们创立了自由和独立的人民民主国家。这个历史性的胜利是捷克民族和斯洛伐克民族进行了许多世纪的民族解放斗争的结果。捷克和斯洛伐克两民族的先进的子女和优秀人物的活动与这一斗争有不可分的联系。捷克斯洛伐克民族文化的发展也与这一斗争有着联系。民族解放和社会解放的思想滋养了人民的创造性。在许多捷克和斯洛伐克杰出的文学家、艺术家、作曲家的作品中都贯穿有这种思想。捷克斯洛伐克人民有权引为骄傲的是，他们对世界文化的发展作出了巨大的贡献。
    俄国的伟大十月社会主义革命，引起了各国民族解放运动、革命运动的强有力的高涨。在俄国社会主义革命的有利影响之下，捷克斯洛伐克各民族加强了争取自由和独立的斗争。一九一八年建立了捷克斯洛伐克共和国。但是剥削阶级夺取了国家的政权。捷克斯洛伐克的经济，它的对内与对外政策都是服从于外国帝国主义者的利益。当时在政权属于资产阶级的情况下，捷克斯洛伐克没有而且也不可能有独立。捷克斯洛伐克资产阶级共和国在两次世界大战之间的历史就明显地证明了这一点。西方资本主义国家的大人先生们口头上主张和捷克斯洛伐克共和国友好，而实际上却把它看作是剥削的对象和实现自己的掠夺目的的重要战略据点。
    在一九三八年实行慕尼黑出卖勾当的可耻的日子里，西方资产阶级国家对捷克斯洛伐克的真实态度就昭然若揭了。资本主义国家的统治者们受其帝国主义利益的支配，竟把捷克斯洛伐克交予法西斯豺狼去蹂躏。只有苏联仍然信守和捷克斯洛伐克所订立的条约。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声。全体起立。代表们齐声有节奏地高呼：万岁，苏联！并高呼：乌拉！）我们的武装部队曾准备来援助捷克斯洛伐克以完成自己的责任。但是当时捷克斯洛伐克的资产阶级政府拒绝了苏联政府关于援助的建议。此外，波兰的反动政府也拒绝让苏联军队通过波兰的领土。捷克斯洛伐克人民确信：在资产阶级共和国的范围内，当剥削者还在当权的时候，是不能达到完全的民族独立和巩固的独立自主的。
      只是在人民民主制度取得了胜利，人民自己成了国家的主人之后，才建立了真正独立的国家——真正人民的捷克斯洛伐克共和国。
    在政权属于人民的情况下，各自由民族平等和友好的伟大原则才可真正实现。捷克和斯洛伐克民族曾被强迫参加过破烂不堪、充满民族纠纷、最终还是崩溃了的奥匈帝国，和这一帝国中的情况不同，现在在人民的捷克斯洛伐克，捷克、斯洛伐克两民族及其他民族联合成了一个统一的、真正民主的国家，他们之间建立了兄弟般的友谊和合作的关系。捷克斯洛伐克各民族在加强和发展自己亲爱的国家中，日渐深刻地了解到：在民主制度的条件下，各个自由和平等的民族的友谊及兄弟关系是具有多么伟大的活力。（鼓掌）
    苏联人民为捷克斯洛伐克人民的光辉胜利而欢欣鼓舞，并认为这一胜利是对整个民主阵营为和平与各国人民的友谊而斗争的共同事业的莫大的贡献。
    苏联劳动人民赞扬捷克斯洛伐克人民为自由而斗争的英雄的历史，十分尊敬捷克和斯洛伐克人民进步的民族传统。
    我们感到十分满意的是，从古远的时代起到现在，我们两国人民之间的关系一直是建筑在真诚和热烈的友谊基础上。在第二次世界大战的年代里，苏捷两国人民之间的友谊特别巩固了起来。我们还记得在索科洛沃、别拉雅—泽尔科夫、热什科夫及苏联其他城市和乡村的多次战役，在这些战役中苏联和捷克斯洛伐克的军队并肩与共同的敌人作战。
  （掌声）
    苏联人民记得，英勇的捷克斯洛伐克军队曾和我们光荣的苏军一道参加了解放苏维埃乌克兰的首都、古老的城市——基辅的战斗，当我回想起捷克斯洛伐克人民的儿子所进行的奋不顾身的战斗时，我感到特别高兴，他们起初是一个旅，后来是一个捷克斯洛伐克兵团，起初是在沃罗涅日战线作战，后来在乌克兰第一战线作战，当时我受我们党的委任担任那个地方的前线军事委员会的委员。我不止一次地看过捷克斯洛伐克部队作战的情况，因此我十分清楚他们英勇战斗的情形。（掌声）捷克斯洛伐克的游击队和苏联的游击队一道与占领者进行了英勇的斗争。在反对我们共同的敌人的斗争中，捷克斯洛伐克的军队得到了不朽的光荣。
    在斯洛伐克的山上，在布拉格的街道和广场上，在赫隆河、发格河、弗尔塔瓦河、拉巴河等流域，在捷克斯洛伐克的田野上和森林里，都洒满了捷克、斯洛伐克和苏联的战士们的鲜血，他们共同为了我们两国人民的荣誉、自由和独立而斗争。（掌声）
    在战后时期内，苏捷两国人民之间的友谊更加有力地发展和巩固起来了。在这个时期内，打碎了希特勒主义的枷锁的捷克斯洛伐克共和国的劳动人民，在苏联人民的兄弟般的帮助下，和其他人民民主国家的劳动人民携手并进，着手奠定社会主义的基础。
    我们两国之间的经济和文化联系正在一天比一天扩大和巩固。捷克斯洛伐克共和国和苏联之间的关系中最珍贵的东西就是我们两国人民之间的友谊。在解放战争的战火中锻炼出来的苏捷两国之间的友谊是牢不可破的。（经久不息的掌声）
    捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民可以坚信，苏联将永远是你们的可靠的朋友，它将继续在你们巩固人民民主制度、进一步巩固和发展你们的国家的斗争中，竭力给予多方面的帮助和支持。（暴风雨般的掌声，继而转为欢呼。全体起立，高呼：苏联万岁！）捷克斯洛伐克和民主阵营各民主国家之间的紧密的经济、政治和文化合作，为它不断地发展自己的国民经济和文化提供了必要的条件，并使捷克斯洛伐克的国家主权和民族独立在捷克斯洛伐克的历史上第一次得到了支持和保障。（掌声）
    苏联、各人民民主国家之间的相互关系是建立在互相完全尊重、真正平等和兄弟般的互助的基础上的。各人民民主国家的劳动人民懂得，只要社会主义阵营各国之间的友谊存在和日益发展，任何敌人都不能从这些国家的人民手中夺去他们的伟大的胜利果实。（掌声）我们的神圣任务是：保护和巩固捷克斯洛伐克和苏联之间的友谊，巩固一切人民民主国家之间的友谊和合作。这就是我们力量的源泉和不可战胜的保证。（经久不息的掌声）毫无疑问，尽管敌人策划种种阴谋，这种友谊将为了我们两国人民的幸福而继续日益巩固和发展。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的人民正在从事建设性劳动，因而切身地关心保卫和巩固世界和平。我们各国的政府坚持不渝地奉行和平外交政策，主张在互利的基础上扩大和巩固事务联系。
    在这方面我们的出发点是：社会主义和资本主义两种不同的社会制度可以长期和平共处。民主阵营各国奉行着和平外交政策，竭力争取缓和国际紧张局势；与一切愿意发展事务联系和贸易的国家发展事务联系和贸易，以及进一步巩固世界和平。
    全世界都知道我们是希望扩大各国人民之间的经济和文化联系、缓和国际紧张局势的。苏联真诚希望防止新战争、保卫和平。关于这一点有许多证明。在苏联颁布了并正在实行这样一种法律，规定严惩战争宣传和战争叫嚣；苏联在停止朝鲜战争上表现了主动精神；我们曾建议作出不使用原子武器的庄严保证，然后再达成完全禁止使用这种大规模屠杀人类的武器的协议；关于大量裁减常备军的建议也是我们提出来的。在柏林会议上，苏联曾用尽一切办法来争取缓和国际紧张局势，解决欧洲问题。现在在日内瓦会议上，苏联、中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国的代表正在竭力争取恢复印度支那和平，公正解决朝鲜问题，从而巩固和平的阵地。（掌声）
    然而大家同时看到，美国许多官员正在煽动战争的空气，公开地叫嚣要发动新战争。美国参议院多数党领袖诺兰就是这些宣扬战争的人当中的一个，他反对和平解决国际问题，叫嚣对苏联进行集中的打击。这种叫嚣是无助于和平解决国际问题的，这难道还不明显吗？
    帝国主义和反动阵营充满内部矛盾。在各资本主义国家，失业人数日益增加，劳动群众的物质状况日益恶化，内部经济困难日益严重。帝国主义者企图用疯狂的扩充军备、加紧剥削工人阶级和劳动农民的办法来克服这一切矛盾。正是为了这个缘故，美国煽动战争歇斯底里、支出庞大的资金扩充军备。甚至资产阶级报纸都无法掩饰它们对下面这一事实的忧虑：猖狂的新战争宣扬者正在将美国变成一个警察和法西斯国家。
    不久前，美国“斯通周刊”的一篇社论说：
  “华盛顿笼罩着这样一种气氛，在国会议员中很少有人敢出来反对将自己的国家变为警察国家，反对在国外进行战争，因为他们害怕被控告以支持共产主义罪。我们是在向战争和法西斯主义方面走，虽然只有一小撮疯子希望战争和法西斯主义……我们这个大国好似一群被几只狂暴的狗吠着赶着走的绵羊，正被引向灾难。历史上很少有过这样的例子：自由人民比现在更少有权利处理自己的命运。”
    这就是美国帝国主义者正在制造的歇斯底里的气氛。而所有这些都是为了榨取最大限度的利润，为了进一步地奴役劳动人民。
    阴谋建立世界霸权的美国帝国主义者企图使人相信，在我们这个时代，大国、特别是小国的国家主权是过去留传下来的遗毒。他们把自己描绘成和平的“保卫者”，而把西欧国家及其他国家的经济夺到自己手中；变这些国家为自己的属地；在这些国家培植亲美的制度。他们在压制人们的良好愿望——对自己的祖国、对祖国的自由和民族独立的热爱。
    帝国主义者对苏联和人民民主国家怀恨已极，这是可以理解的。这些国家的人民把政权掌握在自己手中，建立了民主制度，并不让美国及别的帝国主义者在人民民主国家横行霸道。帝国主义对此是不会甘心的。
    事实表明，帝国主义国家的某些统治集团还不愿放弃他们的幻想，硬以为臭名远扬的实力政策能吓住我们。
    至于苏联，我们对帝国主义大人先生们的威胁总是给以回敬的，苏联人民从来就不怕什么威胁。
  （鼓掌）对苏联人民采取威胁手段已经不是什么创举了，大家知道，希特勒也曾希图靠武力来打垮苏联。但是一切人都还记得，结果是希特勒及其帮凶的死亡。我们的人民清楚地了解自己的力量，如果他们迫不得已，他们是能打垮任何的侵略者的。
  （暴风雨般的掌声）而且各人民民主国家也不是从前那样了。它们已经壮大和巩固了，一旦受到了进攻，它们是不会吃亏的，并且能够保卫自己的果实。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们有充分的根据说：以坚固的友谊而团结起来的、由苏联、中华人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国及其他人民民主国家组成的强大的民主和社会主义阵营，是能够给予战争冒险的玩火者以应得的反击的。（鼓掌）如果帝国主义者发动新的、第三次世界大战，那么他们就会淹死在这一战争，这个战争将以资本主义世界的大崩溃而结束。（经久不息的掌声）
    民主阵营各国的人民在反对法西斯和反动势力的极端残酷的斗争中争得了自己的自由和民族独立，他们争得了踢开资本家及其他剥削者而建立美好生活的权利。他们决不会放弃这些胜利果实。
  （鼓掌）
    捷克斯洛伐克人民曾经有许多世纪遭受过威胁他们民族生存的德国地主和资本家的压迫，捷克斯洛伐克人民为反对他们而进行了奋不顾身的斗争。人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克国家的自由和独立、它的建设社会主义新生活的权利，是以昂贵的代价——捷克斯洛伐克人民的许多优秀儿女的鲜血和生命的代价——所换来的。难道捷克斯洛伐克人民能够同意美国统治集团及其欧洲的伙伴所实行的复活德国帝国主义的政策吗？很明显，曾遭受德国法西斯分子所造成的巨大的艰难痛苦的捷克斯洛伐克人民，是不会答应这样做的。捷克斯洛伐克人民正为欧洲的安全而坚持斗争，并正在和苏联人民、各人民民主国家及一切拥护世界和平的人民携手共同努力。
  （鼓掌）
    对人类的责任要求一切和平拥护者制止新战争的爆发、粉碎侵略集团的计划，以便——用著名的捷克作家卡列尔·查佩克的话来说——不让毒蛇放毒，不让虎狼张牙舞爪。
    世界上存在着健康的力量，并且它们是占着绝大多数。这种力量就是人民群众。他们站在巩固和平的立场上，并且在制止企图发动新战争的侵略者。进步的力量不只是在欧洲活动着，而且还在美洲及世界的各个角落活动着。一切和平力量的迫切任务就是：为巩固欧洲安全，建立亚洲的持久和平，制止帝国主义的任何侵略，无条件地禁止使用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器，进一步缓和国际紧张局势，改善各国人民和各国之间的友好关系而斗争。
    同志们！捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会正在解决重大的任务。它正在总结第九次代表大会以后五年中的党的工作，指出在自由民主的捷克斯洛伐克进一步建设社会主义基础的道路。你们国家的近代发展历史和这次代表大会的工作证明，捷克斯洛伐克共产党是捷克斯洛伐克人民的公认的领袖和久经考验的领导者。他们根据自己许多年的经验相信，共产党的全部活动是为了人民的幸福，是完全从人民的利益出发的。党无愧于人民的信任和支持。例如，共产党领导下的捷克和斯洛伐克民族阵线的候选人在不久前举行的地方人民政权机关——人民委员会的选举中所取得的胜利，就生动地证明了这一点。这次选举又一次显示出捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民是团结在自己的共产党的周围的。伟大的列宁早在一九二一年在谈到捷克斯洛伐克共产党时就指出，必须将大多数劳动人民吸引到党的一边，必须继续吸收工人入党，以便建立不可战胜的力量。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党现在已经成为一支真正的伟大的力量。它获得了捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民的信任，获得了各兄弟共产党和工人党的尊敬和爱戴。它之所以能够如此，是因为它一直是忠实于本国人民的切身利益，忠实于马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的百战百胜的学说。捷克斯洛伐克共产党经常不断地为自己队伍的纯洁和统一进行顽强的斗争。早在资产阶级共和国时代，它就粉碎和清洗了右的和左的机会主义者、托洛茨基分子等党和人民的敌人。最近几年来，党揭发了钻进党的队伍的帝国主义资产阶级的卑鄙的代理人。
    在巩固人民民主国家的斗争过程中，捷克斯洛伐克共产党变成了群众性的党，把人民中的最优秀的、最先进的力量团结在自己的队伍内。马克思列宁主义教导我们，工人阶级革命政党的力量就在于它的队伍的统一，在于党的干部和全体党员的政治锻炼，在于他们对党的政策的正确的了解。因此，共产党的最重要的任务就是对从各种不同居民阶层参加到党的队伍的党员进行细致的坚持不懈的教育，教育他们具有马克思列宁主义的党性，以便使党更加团结一致。正如各国共产党和工人党的经验表明，教育和锻炼组成党的巨大核心的党的积极分子具有特别重要的意义。团结在党中央委员会周围的党的广大积极分子，如果经常对他们进行工作，便是实现党所提出的任务的一支巨大的组织力量。（掌声）
    毫无疑问，捷克斯洛伐克共产党将继续不断地、神圣地保持党的纯洁性，巩固党的队伍的战斗的统一，提高政治警惕，开展党内批评与自我批评，坚持执行集体领导的原则，以及巩固和人民——工人阶级、劳动农民和知识分子——的联系。捷克斯洛伐克共产党经常不断地关怀人民的幸福，今后一定会保证不断地发展国民经济，发展农业和提高劳动生产率。这就使得共产党和捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府能够胜利地执行有计划地减低物价和更充分地满足人民日益增长的物质和精神的要求的政策。
    世界共产主义运动的经验教导我们，无产阶级的革命政党如果能够依靠人民，在自己的活动中遵循马克思列宁主义理论，并把这种理论创造性地应用于具体的历史情况和本国的条件中，它就是不可战胜的。
    让我祝贺你们的代表大会获得成就和有成效地进行工作，你们的代表大会是捷克斯洛伐克的生活中一个重大的事件。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会的决议将使得党更加紧密地团结，更加提高集体领导的作用，并确定捷克斯洛伐克共和国今后走向社会主义的道路。
    苏联共产党中央委员会委托我们代表团向捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会转达下列贺词：
      “捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会：
    苏联共产党中央委员会向捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会致以兄弟的敬礼。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声，继而转为欢呼声。代表们全体起立听取苏联共产党中央委员会的贺词。）
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党依靠广大劳动群众的信任和支持，在巩固人民民主国家和建设社会主义基础方面获得了巨大的成就。在共产党的领导下，捷克斯洛伐克胜利地完成了发展本国国民经济的第一个五年计划，并为大大地发展农业和提高劳动人民的生活水平创造出必要的先决条件。人民的捷克斯洛伐克是为和平、民主与社会主义事业而斗争的积极战士。
    苏联共产党中央委员会衷心地预祝捷克斯洛伐克共产党和全体劳动人民在社会主义建设、巩固工农联盟和巩固捷克斯洛伐克各民族之间的兄弟友谊、发展国民经济和文化、不断地提高劳动人民的生活水平及加强世界和平的斗争中获得新的成就。
    工人阶级和捷克斯洛伐克全体劳动人民的先锋队——捷克斯洛伐克共产党万岁！
    捷克斯洛伐克和苏联两国人民之间的牢不可破的兄弟友谊万岁！
                苏联共产党中央委员会”
      （全场响起暴风雨般的经久不息的欢呼声。代表们欢呼：“苏联万岁！”“苏联共产党万岁！”“和平万岁！”“永远同苏联友好！”高呼：“乌拉！”代表们和来宾们唱“国际歌”。）
            （新华社据塔斯社布拉格十二日电）
