Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd: The heroes and role models of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have expressed their thoughts in support of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

Heroes and role models from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army held a symposium on the Draft Constitution on the 18th. After reading the Draft Constitution with excitement, they all expressed their thoughts. Wang Huyuan, the company commander and Second-Class Hero of a certain unit, said: "Just as our country is transitioning to socialism, the Draft Constitution has been published, which is truly a great joy. The Draft Constitution clearly states the revolutionary achievements of our people and clearly points out the direction for our country to continue to advance. This is a guarantee for our country to realize a socialist society. It further increases our confidence in defending the motherland."

Yang Yucai, deputy platoon leader and First-Class Hero of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, and Ren Zhiming, deputy company commander, Second-Class Hero, and twice awarded the First-Class Merit of a certain unit, also expressed their thoughts on the Draft Constitution. Yang Yucai said: "I wholeheartedly support the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and resolutely abide by the provisions of Article 20 of the Draft Constitution to fulfill my responsibilities." Ren Zhiming said: "We have a particularly important responsibility for ensuring the safe transition of the motherland to a socialist society. I must study the Draft Constitution well, arm myself with socialist ideology, be more vigilant, and strive to defend the motherland and defend peace."

Yang Yonghu, a truck driver from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army who created a record of 80,000 kilometers of safe driving, expressed his thoughts saying: "Before liberation, I worked in a sawmill in Shanghai. At that time, I couldn't get enough to eat or wear, and I was eventually unreasonably fired. In the old society, what democratic rights did the working people have! After liberation, the democratic rights of the working people were guaranteed. Now that the Draft Constitution has been published, it further protects the rights of the people by law. I am determined to actively study technology, improve my skills, and strive to create a higher record of safe driving to celebrate the publication of the Draft Constitution."

    志愿军英雄模范纷纷对宪法草案发表感想
    【新华社平壤二十二日电】中国人民志愿军的英雄、模范发表感想，拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案。
    志愿军某部的英雄、模范，在十八日召开了宪法草案座谈会。他们怀着兴奋的心情阅读了宪法草案后，都发表了自己的感想。二级战斗英雄连连长、二级英雄王虎元说：“正当我们国家向社会主义过渡的时候，宪法草案公布了，这真是一件大喜事。宪法草案把我国人民的革命成果，明明白白地写上了，也清楚地指出了我们国家继续前进的方向。这是我国实现社会主义社会的保证。它更增加了我们保卫祖国的信心。”
    志愿军某部侦察排副排长、一级英雄杨育才和某部副连长、二级英雄、荣立两次一等功的任志明等，也都对宪法草案发表了感想。杨育才说：“我衷心地拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案，并坚决地遵照宪法草案第二十条的规定，尽到自己的职责。”任志明说：“我们对保卫祖国安全地过渡到社会主义社会，负有特别重大的责任。我一定要很好地研究宪法草案，以社会主义思想武装自己，更加提高警惕、为保卫祖国、保卫和平而奋斗。”
    志愿军某部创造安全行车八万公里纪录的汽车司机杨勇虎，他发表感想说：“解放前，我在上海的一个锯木厂做工。那时，吃不饱、穿不暖，最后还被无理地解雇了。在旧社会里，劳动人民有什么民主权利呀！解放后，劳动人民的民主权利才得到保障。现在，宪法草案公布了，它使人民的权利又受到法律的保护。我决心以积极钻研技术、提高本领，争取创造更高的安全行车的纪录，来庆祝宪法草案的公布。”
