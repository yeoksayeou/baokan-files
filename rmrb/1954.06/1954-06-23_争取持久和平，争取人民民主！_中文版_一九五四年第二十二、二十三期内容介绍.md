The Chinese edition of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau's newspaper, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Issues 22 and 23 of 1954 have been published.

The main contents of these two issues are celebrations of the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia, the 3rd Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party, and the Special Session of the World Peace Council in Berlin.

Issue 22 published an editorial entitled "The Indestructible Fraternal Friendship of the Peoples of the Soviet Union." The editorial pointed out the historical significance of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia, and its importance for the political, economic, and cultural development of Ukraine and Russia. The editorial then pointed out that the indestructible friendship and fraternal cooperation between the peoples of Russia, Ukraine, and all the nationalities of the Soviet Union is a reliable guarantee of their national independence, freedom, prosperity, and happiness. The nationwide celebration in the Soviet Union of the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia vividly demonstrates the great unity of the Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people. The friendship of the peoples of the Soviet Union has become a beacon for the working people of the colonies to advance.

The title of the editorial in Issue 23 is "Defend Peace and the Security of All Peoples." The editorial pointed out that the recent special session of the World Peace Council in Berlin once again vividly demonstrated that the forces of peace have become increasingly consolidated. The resolutions passed by the meeting on atomic weapons, on security issues, and the recommendations of the Cultural Committee all have extremely important international significance. These resolutions and recommendations signify a new and significant development in the mass peace movement. The editorial emphasized that the struggle of the people of all countries to maintain and consolidate peace has brought about some relaxation of international tensions. However, the reactionary forces of the United States and their servants are doing everything possible to obstruct the further relaxation of international tensions. The special session of the World Peace Council emphasized the need to ensure the successful conclusion of the Geneva Conference, to reject the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, and to resume negotiations on a peaceful solution to the German question. The editorial said that common security is the only guarantee of the security of all peoples. All relevant countries must first establish common security in Asia and Europe. The progressive and democratic forces of the world will do everything in their power to ensure that the aspirations of the peoples of all countries to ease international tensions and to strive for international security and peace are fully victorious.

Issue 22 published the report by Mátyás Rákosi, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, at the Third Congress of the Labor People's Party, and Voroshilov's speech at the congress.

Issue 23 published the report by Imre Nagy, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic, at the Third Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party, and articles such as "The Political Situation in France" by French Communist Party Central Committee member F. Billoux. (Xinhua News Agency)
