Northwest China purchased more than 360 animal-powered farm implements from Poland and other People's Democratic countries this year. These have been distributed to Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and other provinces, to be supplied to state-run farms, tractor stations, and agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams with better conditions for demonstration purposes. These machines have already played a certain demonstrative role in spring plowing and sowing. The Jiebabei Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuwei, thanks to the use of seeders, saved labor and expanded the sowing area for wheat and flax by more than 1,200 mu. The fallow land was reduced from 30% to 6%.

Currently, all localities are preparing to use the summer harvest to conduct wheat harvesting demonstrations. The provinces have trained more than 100 cadres, who have been sent to the various farms, stations, and agricultural producers' cooperatives to provide specific guidance. The Northwest Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry has also instructed relevant departments to organize wheat harvesting machine teams to selectively harvest crops for the masses in Xi'an and Qingyang, Gansu.

    西北各农场和马拉机站
    进行新农具耕作示范
    西北区今年由波兰等人民民主国家购进畜力农具三百六十多台，分配给陕西、甘肃、青海、宁夏等省，供给各国营农场、马拉机站以及条件较好的农业生产合作社和互助组，进行示范。这些机具在春耕播种中已起到了一定的示范作用，武威界河坝农业生产合作社，由于使用了播种机，节省了劳动力，扩大了小麦和胡麻的播种面积一千二百多亩，轮歇地由百分之三十减少到百分之六。
    目前，各地正准备利用夏收进行割麦示范，各省已训练了一百多名干部，分别到各场、站和农业生产合作社进行具体指导。西北农林局并指示有关部门组织割麦机队，在西安市和甘肃庆阳一带，选择重点替群众收割。　（李运笏）
