    First Session of the First People's Congress Held in Pingshun County, Shanxi
    From June 24th to 27th, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, held the first session of its first People's Congress. One hundred and thirty-seven people's representatives enthusiastically discussed the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China at the meeting and passed a resolution endorsing the Draft Constitution.
    Zhao Yanshou, County Head of the Pingshun County People's Government and Director of the Draft Constitution Discussion Committee, delivered a government work report and a report on the content of the Draft Constitution to all representatives. Zhao Yanshou said: Pingshun County was originally a remote and barren mountainous area "lacking all five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth," but under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of the county have gradually changed their impoverished situation since the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the people's production and life have gradually improved. Now 90 percent of farmers in the county have joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and 289 agricultural production cooperatives have been established. The county's per-mu grain yield has increased from 180 jin before the war to 236 jin last year. Before liberation, farmers lived a life of "half a year of bran and vegetables," but last year the county had a surplus of 6.3 million jin of grain. Before liberation, the county had only one senior primary school, but now it has increased to twelve, and a middle school has also been newly built. Ninety-five percent of school-age children are enrolled, and 64,000 farmers have participated in perennial people's schools. In the past four years, the county has also built more than 4,000 houses. Highways, telephones, and radios have connected the county to the cities.
    The representatives at the meeting enthusiastically discussed the Draft Constitution in light of their personal experiences. Li Shunda said: "Only under the leadership of the People's Government can the working people be masters of their own affairs. In the old society, I fled to Xigou Village to work as a long-term laborer for the landlord. My father was sent to prison for asking the landlord for wages and died of illness as a result; only with the People's Government was I able to receive the glorious title of labor model and the Golden Star Medal, and was also elected as a people's representative." Shen Jilan, Deputy Director of the Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative of Xigou Township, said: In the old society, women revolved around the stove, the millstone, and the kang, with no freedom whatsoever; the People's Government promulgated the Marriage Law, and now the Draft Constitution stipulates women's rights, which is a real concern for us women. She said that she must publicize the Draft Constitution to women and do a good job in the agricultural production cooperative. Guo Yu'en, winner of the Patriotic丰产 Golden Star Medal, also wants to take the practical action of leading the whole cooperative to repair 90 mu of river beach land as a gift to support the Draft Constitution.
    At Li Shunda's suggestion, the representatives at the meeting unanimously passed a resolution endorsing the Draft Constitution. The resolution stated: Each representative guarantees to publicize the Draft Constitution to the voters and organize voters to discuss it; guarantees to implement the Constitution after it is officially promulgated; and also leads the people of the county to work hard to produce and complete the county's plan to increase grain production by 18 jin per mu; raise vigilance and prevent sabotage activities by counter-revolutionaries.
    After carefully discussing the work report of the People's Government, the representatives elected labor model Li Shunda and Wu Houli as representatives to the Provincial People's Congress. (Xinhua News Agency)

    山西平顺县举行首届首次人民代表大会会议
    山西省平顺县从二十四日到二十七日举行第一届第一次人民代表大会会议，一百三十七名人民代表在会上热烈讨论了中华人民共和国宪法草案，并通过拥护宪法草案的决议。
    平顺县人民政府县长、宪法草案讨论委员会主任赵延寿向全体代表作了政府工作报告和有关宪法草案内容的报告。赵延寿说：平顺县原是“金木水火土五行俱缺”的偏僻贫瘠山地，但全县人民在共产党和人民政府领导下，从抗日战争开始到现在，已逐渐改变了贫困的面貌，人民的生产和生活逐渐提高。现在全县百分之九十的农户参加了互助合作组织，已建立二百八十九个农业生产合作社。全县每亩粮食产量已由战前的一百八十斤提高到去年的二百三十六斤。解放前农民过着“糠菜半年粮”的生活，去年全县共有六百三十万斤余粮。解放前全县仅有高级小学一所，现在增加到十二所，还新建了一所中学，百分之九十五的学龄儿童入了学，六万四千名农民参加了常年民校。过去四年来，全县还修建了房屋四千多间。公路、电话和收音机已把这个县和城市联接起来了。
    到会代表联系个人亲身经历热烈讨论了宪法草案。李顺达说：“只有在人民政府领导下劳动人民才能当家作主。在旧社会我逃荒到西沟村，给地主当长工，父亲向地主要工钱被送到监狱，因此得病死了；有了人民政府，我才能得到劳动模范的光荣称号和金星奖章的奖励，还当选为人民代表。”西沟乡农、林、畜牧生产合作社副社长申纪兰说：旧社会妇女绕着锅台、碾台、炕台转，丝毫没有自由；人民政府公布了婚姻法，现在宪法草案又规定了妇女的权利，对我们妇女真是关怀。她表示一定要向妇女宣传宪法草案，作好农业生产合作社的工作。爱国丰产金星奖章获得者郭玉恩也要以领导全社修好九十亩河滩地的实际行动作为拥护宪法草案的献礼。
    在李顺达建议下，到会代表一致通过拥护宪法草案的决议。决议中表示：每个代表保证要向选民宣传宪法草案并组织选民讨论；宪法正式公布后要保证执行；还要带领全县人民努力生产，完成全县每亩增产粮食十八斤的计划；提高警惕，防止反革命分子的破坏活动。
    到会代表认真讨论了人民政府工作报告后，选出劳动模范李顺达、武侯梨为省人民代表大会的代表。　（新华社）
