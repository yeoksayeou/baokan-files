Leading Minorities in Tea Planting

Expanding the planting area of economic crops in mountainous areas is one of the ways the People's Government of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province helps farmers of all ethnic groups transform the mountainous areas. In addition to providing all tea seeds free of charge, the People's Government also dispatches technical cadres to tea-growing areas for specific guidance during sowing. To enable farmers to master tea planting techniques, each county sent more than 30 Jingpo, Lisu and other ethnic minority farmers to the tea farmer training class in the neighboring Baoshan area for study in August last year. This spring, Yingjiang, Lianghe, Ruili and other counties held short-term tea farmer training classes for more than 150 people. With the strong help of the People's Government, the production enthusiasm of farmers of all ethnic groups is very high. Fifty-one of the fifty-four Jingpo farmers in Gongla Village, Yingjiang County, planted tea; Jingpo and Han farmers in Lianghe, Luxi, Longchuan and other counties also organized tea-planting mutual aid groups. Most of the tea seeds sown by farmers of all ethnic groups this spring have emerged and started to sprout, and it is estimated that at least 2.2 million plants will survive. These tea seeds are of the same large-leaf variety as the famous Pu'er tea, and the tea has an excellent flavor.

Mount Feng will no longer be barren

Mount Feng in Qingliu County, Fujian Province, used to be a fertile mountain. Twenty years ago, many families lived here, and the mountains were covered with bamboo forests, palm trees, and tea gardens. However, after the conscription by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the disturbances of bandits, the population dispersed, and the fields were deserted. Before liberation, only one old woman was left. The year before last, mutual aid groups such as Guan'an and Guan Zhongming in Guanchang Township nearby decided to jointly reclaim this barren mountain. They spent more than 900 workdays opening up mountain roads, building thatched houses, and driving away the tigers and wild boars that had long occupied this area. On this hillside covered with waist-high cogon grass, they renovated hundreds of acres of bamboo forests and mountain gardens, and planted many palm trees, tea trees, mountain beans, radishes and pumpkins. Now, the newly renovated tea trees have sprouted new buds, the palm trees can be used to make palm fiber, and the bamboo forests have sprouted spring shoots; the people who reclaimed the land have tasted the fruits of their hard work.

Actively Restore Oil-Tea Forests

Hezhong Township in Pingjiang Eighth District, Hunan Province, is an old revolutionary base area with more mountains than fields and more than 3,000 acres of oil-tea forests. During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang implemented the "Three Alls" policy (kill all, burn all, destroy all), burning down many oil-tea forests. Although a few oil-tea trees grew later, no one cultivated them. The oil-tea forests were almost completely deserted.

After liberation, the People's Government actively led and helped the farmers of the township to restore oil-tea production, and has successively reclaimed more than 1,000 acres of oil-tea forests. This year, the People's Government issued another batch of production subsidies to farmers, and plans to lead the farmers of the township to restore more than 580 acres of oil-tea forests after rice transplanting. In order to overcome the difficulty of labor shortage in mountainous areas, it was decided to organize the surplus labor force from nearby townships to help reclaim the land after rice transplanting, and to give them appropriate remuneration.

Siming Mountain Farmers Actively Build Mountain Areas

Dalan Township in the Siming Mountain area of ​​Zhejiang Province is an old revolutionary base area. In the past, due to the brutal destruction of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the lives of the farmers were very poor. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the farmers of Dalan Township actively restored production and built the mountainous areas. This spring, the township newly cultivated more than 270 acres of tea gardens, and planted more than 200,000 pine and fir trees and nearly 7,000 peach and pear trees. At the same time, they also actively developed animal husbandry. Now the township has raised more than 250 cattle, more than 680 sheep, 600 pigs and 80 sows. Eighty-five percent of the farmers in the township have participated in mutual aid groups and plan to establish two agricultural production cooperatives this year. At present, the spring tea has been harvested, and it is expected that more than 138,000 catties of tea can be harvested this year, an increase of 15% over last year.

Build Danaan Mountain into a Fruit Production Area

In order to build the old revolutionary base area of ​​Danaan Mountain into a rich fruit production area in a planned and step-by-step manner, the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government of the East Guangdong Administrative Office decided to focus on Baiwan Township in Chaoyang County, Xikeng Township in Puning County and other areas this year to lead farmers to develop citrus industry in mountainous areas. In mid-April, the Agricultural and Forestry Department distributed more than 33,000 citrus seedlings worth 100 million yuan to these areas. In order to enable farmers to master the techniques of citrus cultivation, citrus planting training classes were also held. After the students returned to the village, they actively led the farmers to carry out reclamation and planting. The entire Baiwan Township in Chaoyang organized 18 production teams based on mutual aid groups, reclaimed more than 100 acres of wasteland, and completed the task of citrus cultivation in mid-May.

Develop Animal Husbandry in a Planned Way

Quanxi Township in Zhuxi County, Hubei Province, is a mountainous area, and farmers did not pay much attention to the development of animal husbandry in the past. This year, after studying the General Line, the members of the Yongli Agricultural Production Cooperative in the township clarified the direction of future development of mountain production. According to the characteristics of the mountain area and their own conditions, they formulated a plan for developing animal husbandry. In addition to raising six cattle and ten pigs this year, they plan to raise 40 sheep. A animal husbandry group was established to take charge of grazing. They check the breeding of livestock and the sanitation of the pens every three days. If they find that the livestock are sick, they will be treated in time. Now the ewes in the cooperative are pregnant, and the members of the livestock group said happily: "In a few years, this place will become a pasture." Under the influence of the Yongli Agricultural Production Cooperative, mutual aid groups such as Tan Defu and Xu Rongshan also plan to buy dozens of sheep. In order to better guide farmers in mountainous areas to develop animal husbandry, the County Agricultural and Forestry Section also established an animal husbandry technology promotion team in the township.

Poor Mountain Gully Begins to Become Beautiful

Waziyu Village in Liaoyang County, Liaodong Province, is surrounded by mountains. Most of the farmers' land is on the slopes. Although some of the land is relatively flat, the soil is also very poor, so the harvest is not good every year. When mountain floods break out in summer, crops are washed away, houses are destroyed, and farmers' lives are very difficult. After studying the General Line, everyone clarified the direction and future of mountain development, actively participated in mutual aid cooperative organizations and carried out mountain production. Now, the agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in the village have planted more than 1,200 apple, hawthorn, pear and other fruit trees on the mountains around the village, and also planted 20,000 larch trees. In addition, they also raised a lot of cattle, pigs, sheep, etc. In a few years, this poor mountain gully will become a beautiful orchard and pine forest.

Plant Mountain Slopes into Pepper Forests

Most of the land in the Lin Qingyuan Mutual Aid Group in Shuangshi Village, Yuexi County, Xikang Province, is on mountain slopes, with very few trees, and suffers from mountain floods every year. The soil layer becomes thinner, and the soil quality also becomes thinner year by year. The harvest of crops is not as good as each year. This spring, all the members of the group held a meeting to discuss ways to overcome natural disasters. During the discussion, the members mentioned that planting pepper trees is a good way to solve this problem. Originally, some people in the group had planted pepper trees on the mountain slopes before, and they grew very well; grain crops could be planted in the pepper garden to harvest grain; and it could also conserve water and soil, prevent floods and droughts, and increase the production of both pepper and grain. The proposal to plant pepper trees was approved after research. The whole group planted a total of 260 catties of pepper seeds in the spring, and more than 20,000 pepper seedlings can be cultivated this year. They plan to plant pepper trees on all the mountain slopes of the group within four years to create pepper forests.

Organize to Improve Farming Techniques

Hongshagou is a high mountain area in Shirong Township, Hanyuan County, Xikang Province. The local farmers have gradually realized through the education of many facts that farmers in mountainous areas, like farmers in plains, can also improve production as long as they take the road of organization and improve farming techniques. Therefore, nine mutual aid groups were established this year. After these mutual aid groups were established, they built three natural water weirs and renovated and dredged thirty-three ponds. Among them, three mutual aid groups, including Li Yongxian and Li Yongxu, also dug more than 100 drainage ditches in the fields to prevent mountain floods from damaging the crops. Due to the great power of organization, most mutual aid groups also picked out the stones in the fields during spring plowing, which thickened the soil layer and enhanced the drought resistance of the soil. Some also transformed the slopes into terraces, making cultivation more convenient and water and soil easier to maintain. When sowing corn, the plant spacing was generally appropriately shortened, and "sparse plants and dense planting" was implemented.

    山区农民开始走上幸福的道路
    领导少数民族种茶
    在山区扩大经济作物的种植面积，是云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治区人民政府帮助各族农民改造山区的工作之一。人民政府除免费供应全部茶种外，在播种时还派技术干部到种茶地区去进行具体指导。为了使农民掌握种茶技术，各县在去年八月就保送了三十多个景颇、傈僳等族农民到邻近的保山专区参加茶农训练班学习。今年春天，盈江，梁河、瑞丽等县又举办了一百五十多人的短期茶农训练班。在人民政府的大力帮助下，各族农民的生产热情很高。盈江县拱腊寨的五十四户景颇族农民，有五十一户种了茶叶；梁河、潞西、陇川等县的景颇族、汉族农民，还组织了种茶互助组。各族农民今春播种的茶种大都已出土抽条，估计最少能成活二百二十万株。这些茶种和著名的普洱茶同属大叶种，茶味极佳。
    丰山再不荒芜了
    福建省清流县有座丰山，原是座土地肥沃的大山，二十年前这里住有很多人家，满山遍野是竹林、棕榈和茶园，可是经过蒋匪帮抓丁和土匪的扰乱，人口离散，田园荒芜，解放前只剩下一个老太婆。前年，附近官场乡的官安和、官中明等互助组，决定联合起来垦复这片荒山。他们花了九百多工开辟了山路，搭盖了茅楼，赶走了长期盘踞在这里的老虎和山猪，在这一片茅草没膝的山坡上，修整了成百亩竹林和山园，又种上了许多棕榈、茶树、山豆、萝卜和南瓜。现在，新修整的茶树又抽出嫩芽，棕榈已可以剥制棕丝，竹林也长出春笋；垦荒的人们尝到自己辛勤劳动的果实了。
    积极恢复油茶林
    湖南省平江八区和众乡是老革命根据地，山多田少，有油茶林三千多亩。第二次国内革命战争时期，蒋匪帮实行“三光”政策，烧光了很多油茶林。后来虽然长出了少数油茶树，但也无人培植。油茶林几乎全部荒芜了。
    解放后，人民政府积极领导和帮助该乡农民恢复油茶生产，前后已经垦复了油茶林一千多亩。今年，人民政府又发给了农民一批生产补助费，计划在插秧后领导全乡农民再恢复油茶林五百八十多亩。为了克服山区缺乏劳动力的困难，决定在插秧后，组织附近各乡的剩余劳动力去帮助垦复，对他们给予适当的报酬。
    四明山农民积极建设山区
    浙江省四明山区大岚乡是老革命根据地，过去，由于国民党反动派的残酷破坏，农民的生活非常贫困。解放后，在党和人民政府的领导下，大岚乡的农民积极恢复生产和建设山区。今春，全乡又新开垦了二百七十多亩茶园，还栽种了二十多万株松、杉树和将近七千株桃、梨树，同时，他们还积极发展畜牧业，现在全乡已饲养了二百五十多头牛、六百八十多只羊、六百头毛猪和八十头母猪。全乡有百分之八十五的农户参加了互助组。并计划在今年建立两个农业生产合作社。目前，春茶已将采摘完毕，预计今年可采摘十三万八千多斤茶叶，比去年增产一成半。
    把大南山建成水果产区
    广东省人民政府粤东行政公署农林处为了有计划有步骤地把大南山老革命根据地建设成一个富饶的水果产区，决定今年以潮阳县百宛乡、普宁县锡坑乡等地区为重点，领导农民发展山区的柑桔业。农林处在四月中旬就把价值一亿元的柑桔苗三万三千多株分发给这些地区。为了使农民掌握栽培柑桔的技术，又举办了柑桔栽种训练班。学员回到村里后，积极领导农民进行开垦种植。潮阳百宛乡全乡以互助组为基础组织了十八个生产队，开垦荒地一百多亩，五月中旬已全部完成栽培柑桔的任务。
    有计划地发展畜牧业
    湖北省竹溪县泉溪乡是个山区，过去农民不太注意发展畜牧业。今年该乡永利农业生产合作社社员学习了总路线以后，明确了今后山区生产的发展方向，他们根据山区的特点和本身的条件，订了一个发展牧畜业的计划。计划今年除养牛六头、猪十只外，再喂养四十只羊。并成立了畜牧小组，专门负责放牧。他们每三天检查一次牲畜养育情况和圈舍卫生情况，如发现牲畜有病疫，及时治疗。现在社内的母羊已怀了孕，牧畜组组员高兴地说：“再过几年，我们这里就要成个牧场了。”在永利农业生产合作社的影响下，谭德福、许荣山等互助组也计划买几十只羊。为了更好地指导山区农民发展畜牧业，县农林科还在该乡成立一个畜牧技术推广小组。
    穷山沟开始美丽了
    辽东省辽阳县瓦子峪村四周都是大山，农民的土地大部分都在山坡上，虽有一部分土地比较平坦，但土质也很差，所以年年收成不好，每逢夏季山洪暴发时，庄稼被冲走，房屋被冲塌，因此农民生活很困难。经过总路线的学习，大家明确了山区发展的方向和前途，积极参加互助合作组织和开展山区生产，现在，全村的农业生产合作社和互助组，已在村周围的山地上栽种了一千二百多株苹果、山楂、梨等果树，还栽了两万棵落叶松。另外，他们还饲养了很多牛、猪、羊等。几年以后，这个穷山沟就要变成一个美丽的大果园和松树林了。
    山坡地种成花椒林
    西康省越嶲县双师村林清元互助组，组内的土地大部分是山坡地，树木很少，年年遭受山洪冲刷。土层变薄，土质也逐年变瘦，庄稼收成一年不如一年。今年春天，全体组员开了一个会，讨论克服自然灾害的办法，组员们在讨论中都提到种花椒树是解决这个问题的好办法。原来，以前组内就有人在山坡上种过花椒树，生长得很好；花椒园里又能种庄稼，收粮食；并且能保持水土，防洪防旱，花椒、粮食都增产。种花椒树的意见经过研究通过，全组在春季中一共种了二百六十斤花椒种籽，今年可以培育出二万多株花椒苗。他们计划要在四年内把全组的山坡地普遍种上花椒树，造成花椒林。
    组织起来改进耕作技术
    红沙?是西康省汉源县市荣乡的高山地区。当地农民在许多事实的教育下，逐步体会到山区的农民和平坝的农民一样，只要走组织起来的道路，改进耕作技术，也同样可以把生产搞好的。因此，今年一共成立了九个互助组。这些互助组成立起来以后，兴修了三条天水堰，整修、疏淘了三十三个水塘。其中李永现、李永徐等三个互助组，还在地里挖了一百来条排水沟，预防山洪冲坏庄稼。由于组织起来的力量大，在春耕生产中，大多数互助组还掏拣了地里的石头，使土层加厚了，增强了土壤的抗旱能力，有的还把坡地改筑成梯地，使耕作更加方便，水土更加容易保持。在播种玉米的时候，一般都适当缩短了株行距离，实行了“稀株密植”。
