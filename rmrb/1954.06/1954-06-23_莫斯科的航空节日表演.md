    Moscow Aviation Festival Performance
    By Our Correspondent Li He
    On the 20th, the Soviet people celebrated their favorite Aviation Day, reviewing their world-renowned air force. I joined tens of thousands of people in the festivities, sharing the same joy for the Soviet defense power that protects communist construction and world peace.
    Aviation Day, according to the tradition since 1933, was held at the airfield of the Soviet Central Aviation Club named after Chkalov in Tushino, northwest of Moscow. Around noon, the airfield, with its lush green grass, and the surrounding area gathered audiences from all directions. The strong sun shone overhead, and the azure sky was without wind or cloud, as calm as the sea in the morning. The leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the government appeared on the reviewing stand. At exactly twelve o'clock, military music and salutes sounded, and the review began.
    The first part was the performance of the All-Union Voluntary Society for Assistance to the Army, Navy and Air Force (DOSAAF).
    A group of nineteen "Yak-12" aircraft flew slowly in a wedge formation over the airfield at low altitude. The first aircraft carried a large banner with the images of Lenin and Stalin, the next two – the Soviet Air Force flag and the DOSAAF flag, and the sixteen behind them – the flags of the sixteen Soviet republics. This symbolized the Soviet Union's progress under the banner of Lenin and Stalin and the great unity of the people.
    The words "Glory to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" moved slowly in the air. These were formed by seventy-six "Yak-18" aircraft. They flew so neatly as if nailed on the blue curtain. People watched the skilled aviators using aircraft to write the words in the hearts of the people with rapt attention.
    A bright red "Yak-18" came into the sky over the airfield. It raised its head straight up, rolled its body in mid-air, and then dived straight down. Then another red "Yak-11" advanced in the air, rolling and tumbling. These two performed various thrilling stunts of somersaulting and rolling. The pilots were so skilled that the aircraft circling in the air were like goldfish playing in the water, giving no sense of worry.
    A formation like a flock of wild geese flew in from the distant sky. Female pilots flew seven "Yak-18" aircraft. These seven red geese flew in circles over the airfield, collectively performing side rolls and sharp turns, and finally flew away at a low altitude of two hundred meters above the ground. Then twenty-four red "Yak-18" aircraft formed a long snake formation, flew into the airfield sky, drew two circles in the air in single file, transformed into an ellipse, and then spiraled down, reverting to a long snake formation at a low altitude of one hundred meters above the ground and flew away.
    A glider automatically took off from the airfield. The glider pilot flew it to a height of six hundred meters, circling and spiraling for a long time, and finally landed back in place. At the same time, three radio-controlled model aircraft took off from the airfield. They flew to a height of about two hundred meters, turning left and right, spiraling, and finally returned to the airfield.
    An aircraft towed a glider near the airfield sky and then released it. The wings of the glider moved up and down, like a bird flapping its wings, flying freely. Then the aircraft towed six gliders. They were like a group of large eagles quietly patrolling.
    The second part was the performance of military aircraft.
    A jet fighter swept into the sky over the airfield. Its wings were like swallow wings, but very short, and its movements were so fast that it flashed in the air like an arrow. It shot into the high sky with a somersault, and dived to the ground with a swoop. By the time you found its sound, you could no longer see its trace. If the whole aircraft was not painted red, it would be difficult to trace with the eyes.
    Six jet fighters were divided into two groups, flying back to back in the high sky, and meeting each other face to face in the low sky, thus drawing large circles simultaneously on the left and right in the sky and on the earth with uniform movements. Then five aircraft of the same type flew in a triangular formation. After that, nine aircraft of the same type flew in a wedge formation. They were as neat as red patterns pasted on the blue curtain. These group flights of jet fighters all performed complex actions such as straight ascent, dive, turn, side roll, and somersault. Jet aircraft are much faster than propeller aircraft. Soviet pilots were able to control them as if commanding their own hands and feet, and the movements were so uniform. How could this not make the audience exclaim in unison?
    Then one hundred and sixty-two giant jet bombers and one hundred and eighty jet fighters flew past in rows of nine. Finally, fifty-four jet fighters sped past at low altitude. The sound left by this large batch of new aircraft was like a rolling thunder, shaking the entire sky.
    The third part was the performance of the airborne landing team.
    Thirty-six large-bellied dragonfly-like helicopters flew in. Under the cover of twenty-eight jet fighters, these helicopters landed at the airfield and unloaded many cannons and tractors in a few minutes. The helicopters flew away, and the tractors pulled the cannons away.
    An aircraft swept over the airfield, and six parachutists jumped from the aircraft. Then two batches of aircraft came, scattering two batches of parachutists, who all opened their parachutes after ten seconds. Finally, thirty-six aircraft scattered parachutists in batches at a height of four hundred meters. The colorful parachute teams, with the lake-colored sky as the background, wove a brocade curtain inlaid with colorful balloons. The brocade curtain slowly fell. The aviation review ended after an hour and a half of compact performance.
    The Soviet Aviation Day convinced people that under the care of the Soviet Communist Party, the government, and the people, the Soviet aviation power, based on a strong aircraft manufacturing industry, advanced science, superb flying skills, and a large number of aviation enthusiasts, is the world's first.

    莫斯科的航空节日表演
    本报记者  李何
    二十日苏联人过了自己最喜爱的航空节，检阅了举世闻名的空军力量。我随同成千成万人们参加了佳节，对这保卫共产主义建设和世界和平的苏联国防威力，感受到了同样的欢欣。
    航空节按照一九三三年以来的传统，在莫斯科西北土希诺以契卡洛夫为名的苏联中央航空俱乐部的飞机场举行。傍午，在这绿草如茵的飞机场周围和它的附近地带汇集了四面八方来的观众。强烈的太阳当着顶，蔚蓝的天空没有风也没有云，像早晨的海那样恬静。检阅台上出现了苏联共产党和政府的领袖们。十二点正，军乐和礼炮齐鸣，检阅开始。
    第一部分是全苏陆海空军志愿促进协会的表演。
    在机场上的低空，以人字队形缓缓地飞过一群十九架“雅克—十二”式飞机。头一架飘扬着列宁斯大林像的大旗，后两架——苏联空军军旗和全苏陆空海军协助会会旗，再后十六架——苏联十六个加盟共和国国旗。这象征着苏联在列宁斯大林的旗帜下前进和全民大团结。
      在空中慢慢地移动着俄文“光荣归于苏联共产党”的字句，这是用七十六架“雅克—十八”式飞机编组的。它们飞得这样整齐，好像钉在蓝幕上。人们眼不转睛地看着熟练的航空员用飞机写出的人民心坎中的话。
    一架全身通红的“雅克—十八”式来到机场上空。它昂首直上，在半空中翻滚机身，然后俯首直下。接着另一架红色“雅克—十一”在空中打滚地前进。这两架先后做着各种翻筋斗、打滚的惊险动作。驾驶员技术这样高超，在空中盘旋的飞机，犹如在水中游戏的金鱼，不给人任何耽心的感觉。
    远远的天空飞来一字形的雁群。女飞行员们驾来七架“雅克—十八”。这七只红雁到机场上空飞成圈子，集体地侧滚、急转，最后在离地二百公尺的低空飞走了。接着二十四架红色“雅克—十八”组成长蛇阵，飞进机场上空，在空中鱼贯地画两个圈，化成椭圆形，然后螺旋下降，到离地一百公尺的低空又化回长蛇阵飞走了。
    从机场上自动飞起一架滑翔机。滑翔员把它飞到六百公尺高，长久地打转和螺旋，最后降落到原地。同时机场上飞起三架用无线电操纵的飞机模型，它们飞到约二百公尺高，左旋右转，打螺旋，最后也回到机场上。
    飞机牵引着一架滑翔机飞近机场上空，然后撒开了。滑翔机的机翼上下扇动，就像鸟儿拍着翅膀，自在地飞行着。接着飞机牵引来六架滑翔机。它们像一群大鹰静静地巡逻着。
    第二部分是军用飞机的表演。
    一架喷气式驱逐机掠到机场上空来。它的两翼像燕子翅膀，却很短，加以行踪很快，简直像飞箭一般在空中闪动。它一个筋斗射到高空去，一个俯冲又射到地面来。当你找到它的声音时已看不见它的踪迹。如果不是全机漆着红色，那么眼力会难于追索。
    六架喷气式驱逐机分成两组，在高空背向而飞，在低空相向而遇，这样在天地间以齐一的动作左右同时画着大圈。接着是五架同式飞机结成三角队形群飞。再后是九架同式飞机结成品字队形群飞。它们整齐得如同红色的图案贴在蓝色的幕布上，这些群飞的喷气式驱逐机都表演了直升、俯冲、打转侧滚、翻筋斗等等复杂动作。喷气式飞机比螺旋桨飞机快得多，苏联飞行员能够同样地像指挥自己的手脚一样操纵它们，而且动作这样整齐划一。这怎能不使观众异口同声地啧啧称羡呢。
    接着一百六十二架巨型喷气式轰炸机和一百八十架喷气式驱逐机，九架一排地飞过了。最后五十四架喷气式驱逐机在低空疾驰而过。这一大批新式飞机留下的声音，像滚滚的巨雷，震动整个天空。
    第三部分是航空降落队的表演。
    飞来三十六架大肚子黑蜻蜓似的直升飞机。在二十八架喷气式驱逐机的掩护下，这些直升飞机降落在机场，没有几分钟就卸下了许多门大炮和牵引车。直升飞机飞走了，牵引车拉着大炮也开走了。
    一架飞机在机场上空掠过，从机上跳下六个跳伞人员。接着来了两批飞机，撒下两批跳伞人员，他们都是过了十秒钟才张伞。最后三十六架飞机在四百公尺空中分批撒下跳伞人员。前前后后五色缤纷的降落伞队，以湖色的天空为背景，织成了一幅镶着五彩气球的锦幕。锦幕慢慢落下。航空检阅经过一个半小时的紧凑表演就此结束。
    苏联航空节使人信服，在苏联共产党、政府和人民的关怀下，有强大的飞机制造业、先进的科学、高超的飞行术和广大的航空爱好者为基础的苏联航空力量，是世界第一的。
