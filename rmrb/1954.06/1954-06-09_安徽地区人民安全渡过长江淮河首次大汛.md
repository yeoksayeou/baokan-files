Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 7th. The flood prevention work on the Yangtze River, Huai River, and other rivers in Anhui Province has withstood the test of the first major flood season this year. The accumulated water in the farmland has been gradually drained. Farmers have been able to safely harvest summer crops and transplant rice seedlings in a timely manner. Anhui Province experienced heavy rainfall in early summer this year, with the flood season arriving a month earlier than usual. The Yangtze River, Huai River, and many other rivers exceeded the danger level. Thanks to the vigorous efforts in harnessing the Huai River over the past few years, reinforcing the river embankments, and constructing small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, and with the mobilization of more than 460,000 laborers by Party and government leading organs at all levels in Anhui Province to rush to protect the embankments during the arrival of the first major flood, the first major flood season has been safely weathered. More than 10,000 laborers in Wuhe County guarded the Huai River embankment overnight in the rain, ensuring the safe harvest of 100,000 mu of wheat along the river. Farmers in Anqing Prefecture harvested 900,000 mu of rapeseed while diligently preventing floods.

    安徽地区人民安全渡过长江淮河首次大汛
    【新华社合肥七日电】安徽省长江、淮河等河流的防汛工作已经受过了今年首期大汛的考验。现在农田中的积水已逐步排出。农民们得以安全地收获夏收作物和及时插秧。安徽地区今年初夏多雨，汛期较往年提早一个月。长江、淮河和许多河流都曾超过危险水位。由于几年来大力治淮，加固江堤，兴修小型农田水利工程，安徽省各级党政领导机关又在大汛到来时动员了四十六万多民工抢护堤防，首次大汛已安全渡过。五河县一万多民工连夜冒雨坚守了浍河堤防，使沿河十万亩小麦得到了安全收获。安庆专区的农民在紧张防汛中，抢收了九十万亩油菜。
