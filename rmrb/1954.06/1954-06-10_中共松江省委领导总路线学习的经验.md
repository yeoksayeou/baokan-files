    The Experience of the CPC Songjiang Provincial Committee in Leading the General Line Study
    Theoretical Education Section of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Songjiang Provincial Committee
    In the past five months, more than 100,000 in-service cadres in Songjiang Province have studied the Party's general line for the transition period. Thanks to the correct leadership of the CPC Songjiang Provincial Committee and the exemplary role played by the Provincial Committee itself in the study, this study has yielded great results. It has not only enhanced the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of cadres and strengthened their viewpoint of class struggle, but also stimulated their enthusiasm for socialist construction. The majority of cadres clearly understood the relationship between the work of their departments and the realization of the general line, and thus felt the significance and glory of their work tasks. In addition, the cadres' consciousness and enthusiasm for theoretical study have been further improved, and the methods of study, especially the method of integrating theory with practice, have also been improved.
    The CPC Songjiang Provincial Committee has gained the following experience in leading this study:
    I. Conscientiously do a good job in the study of the Provincial Party Committee's core group, lead the advanced groups, and grasp the study of the self-study groups of the municipal and county party committees.
    The core group of the Provincial Party Committee systematically studied the documents and repeatedly studied the relevant theoretical issues in accordance with specific plans and study priorities. They treated their study with a high degree of consciousness and a serious and conscientious attitude, setting a good example for all comrades in the advanced groups and cadres throughout the province. Despite being busy with work, the main responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee still squeezed out five or six hours or more of spare time each week for self-study. The core group of the Provincial Party Committee not only strictly required themselves to study well, but also regarded guiding the advanced groups and general cadres in their study as an important task. Most of the comrades in the core group gave study reports to the cadres of the directly affiliated organs of the province and to lecturers throughout the province. Some responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee also gave study reports to the cadres in various regions when they went down to inspect work, providing specific guidance to the study in various places.
    The advanced study group of the directly affiliated organs of the province carried out its study under the direct guidance of the core group. Each comrade of the core group often participated in the study of the advanced groups separately, and stipulated three specific tasks: (1) Maintain regular contact with the group leaders and mutual aid group leaders and active learners of each group, understand the situation and problems, and report them to the core group leader in a timely manner; (2) Supervise and inspect the study of the groups they are responsible for leading, convey the intentions of the core group, and take the lead in adhering to the study system; (3) Participate in the discussion meetings of the groups they are assigned to lead, help the group leaders grasp the focus of the discussion, correct deviations, and guide them in depth. Through this form, supplemented by the coordination and guidance of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, it is possible to grasp the study situation of the advanced groups in a timely manner, discover problems, correct deviations, and summarize and exchange experiences. After studying a problem, the leader of the core group will answer theoretical questions to all the students in the advanced group and give clear instructions on ideological and work methods. Each time the core group holds a discussion meeting, the group leaders of the advanced groups are invited to participate, which not only improves the group leaders' understanding of the issues and clarifies the focus of the discussion, but also enables the group leaders to directly learn the methods of leading discussion meetings. In leading the study of the advanced groups, it is emphasized that serious self-study should be carried out on the basis of centralized study, and attendance status should be published regularly in the "Study Bulletin." In order to check and promote the study of cadres who are away from their posts, all advanced group members (including the core group) who are away for more than one week must fill out a "Study Report Form for Those Away from Posts." In addition, it is also stipulated that each advanced group member should submit a study paper or reflection. Every stage of the general line study strives to have arrangements, checks, and summaries, and never ends hastily in order to rush progress.
    The Provincial Party Committee also seriously leads the self-study groups of the municipal, county, factory, mining, and forestry industrial party committees, in order to strengthen the specific guidance for the study of cadres in various regions through them. The Provincial Party Committee requires the comrades of the self-study groups of the municipal and county party committees to study ahead of the general cadres, so as to explain to the students in the junior groups. In addition, the self-study groups of the municipal, county, factory, mining party committees must regularly report on their study situation. The Provincial Party Committee also sends people to conduct key in-depth inspections of the study of the self-study groups, in order to promptly conduct criticism, praise, or introduce advanced experiences in the "Study Bulletin." When the comrades of the self-study groups of the municipal and county party committees come to the Provincial Party Committee to attend work meetings, the responsible comrades of the various departments of the Provincial Party Committee combine their work to give ideological mobilization for study. Recently, a test was held, and the secretaries of the municipal, county, industrial and mining, and forestry industrial party committees were designated to write study papers. In order to theoretically guide their study, in addition to compiling and printing the remarks of Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao on the transition period, the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee also compiled and printed the records of the special reports of the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee. Through a series of assistance, the local party committee self-study groups have gradually formed the core of leading study in their respective regions during the general line study.
    II. Strengthen specific guidance for the study of general cadres.
    In the general line study, the Provincial Party Committee has planned and organized more than a dozen large report meetings, with the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee giving reports, and organizing advanced group members, intermediate group A study tutors, and comrades from local party committee self-study groups and lecturers to attend. These reports have played a great role in guiding cadres to study in depth. Many members of the advanced group, municipal and county party committee self-study groups, and responsible cadres of various units also often pay attention to leading and helping the study of cadres in their own units. In order to improve the level of tutoring work, the Provincial Party Committee Study Office compiled some study materials, printed six issues of the "Study Bulletin" supplement, formulated reference topics, organized answers to difficult questions, and organized collective tutoring for tutor groups. The study tutoring work is generally carried out under the direct leadership of the general party branches and branches of the organs. In addition, the "Study Bulletin" has organized discussions on the issue of socialist transformation of the small-peasant economy, and paid attention to summarizing and introducing good tutoring experiences.
    In order to specifically and deeply guide the study of cadres throughout the province and strengthen the organization and leadership of the study, the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee roughly divided the cadres of the province into four categories: finance and economics, industry and mining, rural areas, and general organs, and determined key units, and put forward different requirements for each. The Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee also made corresponding divisions of labor in terms of leadership. Since the study of the general line, cadres have been sent down twice a month on average (each time for about ten days) to conduct focused inspections and assistance. For general cities and counties, a regular telephone or written reporting system has been established, which basically ensures that the study situation in various places is grasped in a timely manner, problems are discovered, experiences are exchanged, and deviations are corrected. At the same time, opportunities such as inviting local lecturers to the province to listen to reports or holding meetings in different regions are used to organize prepared study reports and arrange study tasks.
    In the general line study, the Provincial Party Committee closely grasped the ideological situation of the cadres. For example, some comrades in the advanced group were afraid that studying too much would affect their work; some general cadres believed that "they have learned almost enough, and there is nothing new to learn," and there was a period of complacency and slackness; others believed that doing a good job is to implement the general line, and that studying or not studying does not matter much, and so on. For these incorrect understandings, the Provincial Party Committee promptly criticized them through meetings and the "Study Bulletin."
    III. Strengthen specific guidance for integrating theory with practice.
    While emphasizing the systematic study of documents, the Provincial Party Committee strengthened specific guidance for integrating theory with practice, effectively preventing the two deviations of abandoning documents and prematurely connecting with reality, and studying documents abstractly without paying attention to connecting with reality.
    The Provincial Party Committee emphasized that each cadre should first carefully read the documents and read the necessary reference materials, truly understand the essence of the general line, and then use what they have learned to solve the main problems in their own thinking and work. The Provincial Party Committee advocated giving play to free thinking in the study, paying attention to studying the practical problems in economic construction, and also required the responsible cadres of the party committees at all levels and various departments to introduce their experiences in connecting with reality to the cadres of their subordinate departments, guiding and helping them to correctly connect with reality.
    In the first quarter of this year, the Provincial Party Committee successively convened political work conferences for industry and mining and forests, rural mutual aid and cooperation conferences, and state-owned commercial supply and marketing cooperation conferences, focusing on the leading cadres of various departments, and checking and summarizing the work in industry, agriculture, commerce, etc. on the basis of in-depth study of the general line. These meetings played a great role in promoting the development of work and further implemented the principle of integrating theory with practice.
    In addition, the Provincial Party Committee formulated a batch of special topics, designated relevant responsible comrades to conduct research, and then write reports with information, analysis, and conclusions, which were reviewed by the core group and then reported to the cadres. In order to provide practical materials to help cadres criticize bourgeois ideology, the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee conducted investigations and research on the ideological situation of various types of cadres, and the party committees of various cities, counties, and industrial and mining enterprises also followed the example of the Provincial Party Committee, with leading cadres dividing their work to conduct special research and conduct research on the ideological situation of cadres. The Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee specially sent people to specifically help the intermediate group A of the Provincial People's Government's Finance and Commerce Departments to study the experience of connecting with reality. In order to strengthen the specific leadership for the study of cadres in the financial and economic departments, the party committees of various cities and counties absorbed the leading cadres of the financial and economic departments to participate in the self-study group study, and often sent people to key units to provide specific guidance. Therefore, the financial and economic departments (tax bureaus, banks, cooperative city and county joint societies, and state-owned companies, etc.) of various cities and counties have achieved better results in connecting with reality.

    中共松江省委领导总路线学习的经验
    中共松江省委宣传部理论教育处
    近五个月来，松江省十多万名在职干部学习了党在过渡时期的总路线。由于中共松江省委的正确领导，以及省委本身在学习中所起的模范作用，这次学习得到了很大的收获，不仅使广大干部提高了社会主义的觉悟，加强了阶级斗争的观点，并且激发了他们的社会主义建设的热情。多数干部明确认识了本部门工作和实现总路线的关系，从而感到工作任务的重大和光荣。此外，干部理论学习的自觉性和积极性也有了进一步的提高，学习的方法，特别是理论联系实际的方法也有了改进。
    中共松江省委在领导这一学习中获得了以下几点经验：
    一、认真搞好省委核心组，带动高级组，抓住市、县委自修组的学习。
    省委核心组按照具体计划和学习重点，系统地学习了文件和反复地钻研了有关的理论问题。他们以高度的自觉精神和严肃认真的态度对待自己的学习，给全体高级组同志以及全省干部树立了学习的好榜样。省委主要负责同志工作虽忙，每周仍挤出五、六小时以至更多的业余时间来自修。省委核心组不仅严格要求本身学好，而且把指导高级组和一般干部学习当作重要的任务。核心组的多数同志分别向省直属机关干部和全省讲师连续作了学习报告。省委有些负责同志在下去检查工作时，还给各该地区干部作了学习报告，具体指导各地的学习。
    省直属机关高级学习组是在核心组直接指导下进行学习的。核心组每个同志经常分别参加高级组学习，并规定了三项具体任务：（一）经常保持与各小组组长、互助组长和学习积极分子的联系，了解情况和问题，及时向核心组组长反映；（二）督促与检查自己负责领导的小组的学习，传达核心组的意图，并以身作则坚持学习制度；（三）参加自己分工领导的小组的讨论会，帮助小组长掌握讨论中心，纠正偏向，引向深入。通过这种形式，辅以省委宣传部的配合指导，就能及时掌握高级组的学习情况，发现问题，纠正偏差，总结和交流经验。每学完一个问题，由核心组组长对高级组全体学员解答一次理论问题，并对思想方法和工作方法作明确的指示。每次核心组开讨论会都吸收高级组的小组长参加，这样既可提高小组长对问题的认识，明确讨论的中心，还能使小组长直接学到领导讨论会的方法。在领导高级组学习方面，强调在集中学习的基础上认真自修，定期在“学习通报”上公布出席状况。为了检查和推动外出干部的学习，凡高级组学员（包括核心组）外出时间在一周以上的须填写
  “外出学习汇报表”。此外，还规定高级组每人交一篇学习论文或心得。总路线学习每个阶段都力求做到有布置、有检查、有总结，决不因赶进度而草率结束。
    省委对市、县、厂矿、森林工业的党委学习自修组也认真领导，以便通过他们加强对各地区干部学习的具体指导。省委要求市、县委自修组的同志学习在一般干部的前面，以便为初级组学员讲解。此外，市、县、厂矿党委自修组必须定期汇报学习情况。省委还派人重点深入检查自修组的学习，以便及时在“学习通报”上进行批评、表扬或介绍先进经验。市、县委自修组同志到省委开工作会议时，省委各部负责同志即结合工作做学习的思想动员。最近举行了测验，并指定市、县、工矿、森林工业党委书记写学习论文。为了从理论上指导他们学习，省委宣传部除辑录列宁、斯大林和毛主席有关过渡时期的言论印发外，还把省委负责同志的专题报告记录整理好印发下去。通过一系列的帮助，各地党委自修组在总路线学习中，已逐步形成各该地区领导学习的核心。
    二、加强对一般干部学习的具体指导。
    在总路线学习中，省委曾有计划地组织了十多次大报告会，由省委负责同志作报告，组织高级组学员、中级甲组学习辅导员和各地党委自修组同志及讲师等来听讲。这种报告对引导干部深入学习起了很大的作用。高级组、市县委自修组不少成员和各单位负责干部，也经常注意领导和帮助本单位干部的学习。为了提高辅导工作的水平，省委学习室汇编了一些学习材料，印发了六期“学习通报”增刊，拟定了参考题目，组织解答疑难问题，整理核心组的专题发言，加强辅导员小组的集体辅导等。学习辅导工作一般都是在机关党的总支和支部的直接领导下开展起来的。此外，“学习通报”上曾组织了对小农经济实行社会主义改造问题的讨论，并注意总结和介绍好的辅导经验。
    为了具体地深入地指导全省干部的学习，加强对学习的组织领导，省委宣传部将全省干部大体上分为财经、工矿、农村和一般机关四大类，并确定了重点单位，分别提出不同的要求。省委宣传部在领导方面也作了相应的分工。学习总路线以来，每月平均派干部下去两次（每次十天左右），进行有重点的检查和帮助。对一般市、县则建立定期的电话或书面的汇报制度，基本上作到了及时掌握各地的学习情况，发现问题，交流经验和纠正偏向。同时也利用各地讲师来省听报告或分地区开会等机会，组织有准备的学习汇报和布置学习任务。
    在总路线学习中，省委紧紧掌握干部的思想情况。如高级组有的同志曾害怕学习多了，会影响工作；一般干部有的认为“学得差不多了，再没啥新东西可学”，曾一度产生自满和松劲情绪；也有的认为做好工作就是贯彻总路线，学习不学习关系不大等等。对于这些不正确的认识，省委都及时通过会议和“学习通报”予以批判。
    三、加强对理论联系实际的具体指导。
    在强调系统地钻研文件的同时，省委又加强对理论联系实际的具体指导，有效地防止了丢开文件过早地联系实际和抽象地学习文件不注意联系实际两种偏向。
    省委强调每个干部首先要精读文件和阅读必要的参考资料，真正领会总路线的实质，从而运用所学到的东西解决自己思想和工作中的主要问题。省委在学习中提倡发挥自由思想，注意研究经济建设中的实际问题，还要求各级党委和各部门的负责干部，把自己联系实际的经验介绍给所属部门的干部，引导和帮助他们正确地联系实际。
    省委在今年第一季度内连续召开了工矿和森林的政治工作会议、农村互助合作会议和国营商业供销合作等会议，集中各部门的领导干部，在深入学习总路线的基础上检查和总结了工业、农业、商业等方面的工作，这些会议对工作的开展起了很大的推动作用，进一步贯彻了理论联系实际的原则。
    此外，省委并拟定了一批专题，指定有关的负责同志进行研究，然后写出有情况、有分析、有结论的报告，经核心组审查后，向干部作专题报告。为了提供实际材料帮助干部批判资产阶级思想，省委宣传部进行了各类干部思想情况的调查研究工作，各市、县、工矿党委也仿效省委的做法，由领导干部分工进行专题研究，并对干部思想情况进行研究。省委宣传部特派人具体帮助省人民政府财政、商业两厅的中级甲组研究联系实际的经验。各市、县委为了加强对财经部门干部学习的具体领导，吸收财经部门的领导干部参加自修组学习，并经常派人到重点单位去作具体指导。因此各市县的财经部门（税务局、银行、合作社市县联合社和国营各公司等），在联系实际方面都有较好的收获。
