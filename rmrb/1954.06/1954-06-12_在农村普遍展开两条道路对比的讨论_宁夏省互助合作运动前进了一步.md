    Discussions on Contrasting the Two Roads Universally Unfolded in Rural Areas
    Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement in Ningxia Province Took a Step Forward
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party committees at all levels, the broad masses of peasants in Ningxia Province have universally and enthusiastically launched a discussion on "the comparison of the two roads of socialism and capitalism in rural areas." According to incomplete statistics at the end of May, 60 percent of the townships and more than 80 percent of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in the agricultural areas of the province have already conducted discussions.

    During the discussions, the peasants closely integrated theory with practice and repeatedly conducted comparative studies, thus gaining great benefits. The livestock and farm tools of the Shichangzhen Mutual Aid Team in Baonan Township, Helan County, were not as good as those of the Tanjinxiao Mutual Aid Team, but the team members had more enthusiasm for production. Therefore, not only were the crops planted well, but they also freed up manpower to dig licorice and bitter beans, earning more than 4.5 million yuan in the two months of spring. In addition to improving the lives of the team members, they also added cattle. However, the members of the Tanjinxiao team wanted to make money by doing business. Last year, they borrowed 2.5 million yuan to traffic livestock, and made 400,000 yuan the first time. They trafficked twice more, but failed to sell them and lost more than 1.7 million yuan. Everyone blamed each other, and the farm work was delayed. Some team members even ran out of food. After discussion, everyone found the root cause: mainly because they did not recognize the road clearly and did not take the right steps, and suffered from capitalist ideology.

    Through this discussion, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Ningxia Province has taken a big step forward. Yongning County has newly organized 20 year-round mutual aid teams and 145 seasonal mutual aid teams, with about 1,000 peasant households beginning to organize. In Pingluo County, 82 mutual aid teams with a better foundation are actively creating conditions to strive for transition to cooperatives after the autumn harvest. The peasants also actively participated in credit cooperatives to block the exploitation of usury. According to incomplete statistics, there are already 25 credit cooperatives and 75 credit mutual aid teams in the province. In addition, during the discussion, the organized peasants reviewed that they had not helped individual peasants enough, and began to enthusiastically help them, further strengthening the unity between the peasants.

    在农村普遍展开两条道路对比的讨论
    宁夏省互助合作运动前进了一步
    宁夏省广大农民在中共各级党委的领导下，普遍热烈地展开了一次“农村中社会主义和资本主义两条道路对比”的讨论。据五月底的不完全统计，全省农业区百分之六十的乡，百分之八十以上的农业生产合作社和互助组都已经进行了讨论。
    讨论时，农民们密切联系实际，反复进行对比研究，因而获得很大收益。贺兰县保南乡石长珍互助组的耕畜和农具都不如谭金孝互助组的好，可是组员们的生产劲头却比他们大，因此不仅庄稼种得好，还腾出人力挖甘草、挖苦豆子，今春两个来月就挣了四百五十多万元，除了改善组员的生活外，还添置了耕牛。而谭金孝组组员们都想做生意赚钱。去年借了贷款二百五十万元贩卖牲畜，头一回挣了四十万，又连着贩了两回，结果没卖出去赔了一百七十多万元，大家互相埋怨，庄稼活也误了。个别组员还断了吃粮。经过讨论，大家找到了根子：主要是道路没认清，步子没走正，受了资本主义思想的害。
    宁夏省通过这次讨论，互助合作运动前进了一大步，永宁县就新组织起二十个常年互助组，一百四十五个季节性互助组，约有一千户农民开始组织起来。平罗县有八十二个基础较好的互助组，正在积极创造条件，争取秋后转社。农民们还踊跃地参加了信用合作社，堵塞高利贷的剥削，据不完全的统计，全省已有二十五个信用合作社和七十五个信用互助组。此外，讨论中，组织起来的农民检讨了对个体农民帮助得不够，并开始热情地帮助他们，进一步加强了农民之间的团结。　　　（朱鉴元）
