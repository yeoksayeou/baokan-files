The capital has nearly thirty municipal construction projects underway, proceeding smoothly.

To support the construction of the Northeast Suburban Industrial Zone, the Northwest Suburban Cultural and Educational Zone, and the West Suburban Residential Zone, the Beijing Municipal People's Government plans to build over 170 kilometers of roads, 35 kilometers of sewers, and over 30 kilometers of water pipes this year. A fifteen-meter wide, eight-kilometer long road from Dongzhimen to the Northeast Suburban Industrial Zone is under construction and will be completed in about a month. In the future, vehicles loaded with industrial products and raw materials can travel on this road after the new factories are built. The road from Xinjiekou Huokou to the newly built Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, Beijing Petroleum Institute, Beijing Geological Institute, and other nine colleges is being renovated into a high-grade surface. The Beijing Public Transportation Company has also opened new bus routes here to make transportation between the cultural and educational area and the city center more convenient. The Fuchengmenwai Street sewage pipe and the Binhe interception pipe along the Fuchengmen to Guang'anmen moat are the largest sewer projects in Beijing this year. The project started on March 1st this year and is expected to be completed by the end of October. More than 3,000 workers are working on it. After the completion of this project, it will not only solve the sewage disposal problem of schools, government agencies, and residential buildings in the Fuchengmenwai Street area, but also intercept most of the sewage discharged from the newly built areas in the western suburbs and many sewers in the western part of the city and inject it into this sewer, so as to improve the current pollution of the West Moat.

As the construction area of the capital continues to expand, eight water source wells will be opened this year in industrial areas, cultural and educational areas, and other places. Two of them have been completed, and one is under construction. In addition, the water distribution pipeline will be expanded accordingly, and the water pressure will be appropriately improved to make the water supply in the urban area more popular. The Beijing Public Transportation Company also plans to open more bus routes and equip some large buses this year.

This year's urban greening project focuses on seedling cultivation, greatly increasing the number of nurseries, and plans to propagate, transplant, and maintain more than 12 million seedlings. The nursery near the Northeast Suburban Industrial Zone will serve as a windbreak belt after the trees grow up to reduce wind and sand erosion. Various trees have been densely planted in the famous Temple of Heaven. In the new parks such as Zizhuyuan, Taoranting, and Longtan, trees and flowers will be planted on more than 160,000 square meters of land this year. Trees have been planted along the road from Beijing to Shijingshan, the new urban area in the western suburbs, and other places. With the help of the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Beijing, these greening projects have been completed ahead of schedule for digging and transplanting. (Xinhua News Agency)

Xinhua News Agency: The eight industrial cities in Northeast China, including Shenyang, Dalian, Fushun, Anshan, and Harbin, are carrying out municipal construction projects in a planned way. These eight cities are the focus of urban construction in Northeast China this year, with investment accounting for 91.1% of the total urban construction investment in Northeast China.

The municipal construction of these cities is carried out in accordance with the needs of production and construction. After the completion of various municipal construction projects, it will bring great convenience to industrial production, industrial construction, and the working people. Urban traffic in Shenyang, Harbin, Anshan, Fushun, and other cities will have new developments this year. Shenyang City will build and repair eleven asphalt and macadam roads this year, with a total area of 261,800 square meters. The longest and widest is an asphalt road from the Tiexi Industrial Zone to the Nanhu Scenic Area, with tram tracks laid on the asphalt road. Harbin City will build roads with an area of more than 88,000 square meters this year. Anshan City is building a reinforced concrete overpass bridge, which is more than 90 meters long. After the bridge is completed, it will connect the areas east and west of the railway in Anshan City, and people traveling between Tiexi and Tiedong areas can safely pass on the bridge. Shenyang and Harbin will add buses on the main traffic lines in the city. With the development of industrial construction, the water consumption of these cities has increased rapidly. Now all cities are expanding water sources and adding tap water pipes. Shenyang is opening up a large water source area near the industrial area and the newly built workers' residential area. The water sent out here every day can supply tens of thousands of people. Harbin plans to repair a nearly four-kilometer-long water supply trunk line this year. Clean water equipment will be added to the water purification station to make tap water cleaner. Fushun City has invested more than half of its municipal construction investment in water supply projects. Dalian City will lay a 23-kilometer-long tap water pipeline this year to meet the needs of factory production and residents' water use. Fushun and Anshan are both building gas pipelines to supply gas to workers and their families in large quantities. In order to improve urban sanitation, Shenyang, Anshan, and other cities are building underground water pipelines and culverts.

The municipal construction projects in each city have started one after another, and some projects have been completed. Thousands of workers in Shenyang are building roads on several lines, such as South Wuma Road and Tiexi Workers' Village. The underground water pipe and culvert project, which runs through Shenyang City for more than 3,800 meters, is also underway. Thick cement pipes are being laid at the starting point of the project. Several brand-new wooden bridges have appeared on Nanhu Park and the nearby canal. The water supply pipeline restoration project in Harbin City has been basically completed. The construction of roads and bridges, the laying of gas pipelines and water pipelines in Anshan, Fushun, and other cities are also in progress.

    首都各项市政建设顺利施工
    东北区沈阳鞍山等八个工业城市加强市政建设
    首都今年已有近三十项的市政建设工程正在顺利施工。
    为配合东北郊工业区、西北郊文教区和西郊住宅区等的建设，北京市人民政府今年计划修建一百七十多公里道路、三十五公里下水道和三十多公里自来水管。从东直门到东北郊工业区一条十五公尺宽、八公里长的大路正在修建，再隔一个月就可完工。将来新的工厂建成后，满载工业品和工业原料的车辆就可以在这条大路上行驶。从新街口豁口通到新建的北京钢铁工业学院、北京石油学院、北京地质学院等九大学院去的道路，正在翻修成为高级路面，北京市公共汽车公司也已在这里开辟新的公共汽车路线，使文教区和市中心的交通联系更加方便。阜成门外大街污水管和沿阜成门到广安门护城河的滨河截流管，是北京市今年最大的下水道工程。这个工程在今年三月一日开始施工，预计在十月底完工，现在有三千多个工人在劳动着。这项工程完成后，不但可以解决阜成门外大街一带的学校、机关和市民住宅的污水排除问题，而且可以把西郊新建地区和城区西部许多下水道排出的污水绝大部分截流注入这条下水道，以改善目前西护城河的污染情况。
    由于首都建筑面积不断扩大，今年在工业区、文教区等地要开辟八座水源井。其中有两座已经完成，一座正在施工。此外还要相应地扩充配水管线，适当改善水压，使得市区的用水更加普及。北京市公共汽车公司今年也准备陆续开辟行车线路，配备一些大型公共汽车。
    城市绿化工程今年以育苗为重点，大量增辟苗圃，计划繁殖、移植和保养苗木一千二百多万株。东北郊工业区附近的苗圃，在树木成长以后，将作为一片防风林带，以减少风沙侵袭。著名的天坛已密密地种上各种乔木。在紫竹院、陶然亭、龙潭等新建公园内，今年要在十六万多平方公尺的土地上栽植树木和花草。北京到石景山的公路、西郊新市区等地都已种上行道树。这些绿化工程经中国人民解放军驻京部队的帮助，已经提前完成掘苗和移植等工作。　（新华社）
    东北区的沈阳、旅大、抚顺、鞍山、哈尔滨等八个工业城市，正在有计划地进行市政建设工程。这八个城市是今年东北区城市建设的重点，投资占东北全区城市建设投资的百分之九十一点一。
    这些城市的市政建设是适应生产建设的需要进行的。各项市政建设工程完工以后，将给工业生产、工业建设和劳动人民带来很大便利。沈阳、哈尔滨、鞍山、抚顺等城市的市区交通，今年都将有新的发展。沈阳市今年要新建和补修十一条柏油路和碎石路，面积总共有二十六万一千八百平方公尺。其中最长最宽的是从铁西工业区通往南湖风景区的一条柏油路，柏油路上铺设着电车轨道。哈尔滨市今年将修建八万八千多平方公尺面积的道路。鞍山市正在兴建一座钢筋混凝土跨线大桥，长达九十多公尺。大桥建成以后，将把鞍山市铁路以东和铁路以西的地区联接起来，来往于铁东、铁西地区的人们可以安全地在桥上通行。沈阳市和哈尔滨市将在市内的主要交通线上，增添公共汽车。随着工业建设的发展，这些城市的用水量增长得很快。现在各个城市都在扩大水源和增设自来水管道。沈阳市正在工业区和新落成的工人住宅区附近开辟一个很大的水源地带，这里每天送出的水，可以供几万人饮用。哈尔滨市今年计划修复一条将近四公里长的上水道干线。在净水站要增设清水设备，使自来水更加清洁。抚顺市以半数以上的市政建设投资用在上水道工程上。旅大市今年要铺设一条二十三公里长的自来水管道，以满足工厂生产和居民用水的需要。抚顺和鞍山都正在修建瓦斯管道，以便把瓦斯大量供给工人和他们的家属使用。为了改善市区卫生，沈阳、鞍山等市都在修建地下水管道和暗渠。
    各城的市政建设工程都已陆续开工，有的工程并已完成。沈阳市几千个工人正在南五马路、铁西工人村等几条线路上修建道路。贯穿沈阳市内的长达三千八百多公尺的地下水管和暗渠工程也在进行。粗大的水泥管道正在工程的起点开始埋设。在南湖公园和附近的运河上，已经出现了几座崭新的木桥。哈尔滨市的上水管道恢复工程已经基本上完工。鞍山、抚顺等市的道路、桥梁的修建，瓦斯管道、水管道的铺设，也都在进行中。　（新华社）
