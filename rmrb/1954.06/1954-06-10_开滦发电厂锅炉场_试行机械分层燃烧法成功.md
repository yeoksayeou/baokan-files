Kailuan Power Plant Boiler Room
    Successfully Implements Mechanical Layered Combustion Method
    The Kailuan Power Plant boiler room, learning from advanced Soviet experience, has achieved initial success in piloting the mechanical layered combustion method. The successful trial of the mechanical layered combustion method is a significant reform for grate boilers in thermal power plants. It can send coal chunks and coal fines to the furnace in separate layers, allowing the coal to be fully burned, improving boiler thermal efficiency, and reducing coal consumption. According to preliminary test results, boiler thermal efficiency is increased by 2%. After this combustion method is implemented in all boilers in the plant, more than 5,000 tons of coal can be saved annually. It is also suitable for maximizing the combustion of low-value coal. Because the mechanical layered combustion method provides vigorous and balanced fire, it can keep the boiler pressure stable, which also provides a significant guarantee for safe power generation.

    开滦发电厂锅炉场
    试行机械分层燃烧法成功
    开滦发电厂锅炉场学习苏联先进经验，试行机械分层燃烧法初步获得成功。机械分层燃烧法试验成功，对火力发电厂炉排锅炉是一项重大改革，它能把煤块和煤末分层送到炉膛内，使煤得到充分燃烧，提高锅炉热效率，降低煤耗。据初步试验结果，锅炉热效率提高百分之二，全厂所有锅炉推行这一燃烧方法以后，一年可以节省煤五千多吨。并适于最大限度地燃烧低值煤。由于使用机械分层燃烧法火力旺盛、均衡，可以使锅炉气压经常保持平稳，对安全发电也有很大保障。　　（王蓝）
