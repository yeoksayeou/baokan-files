As Close as Blood Relatives
——A Record of Cui's Visit to Luo Shengjiao's Hometown
Jin Feng

    On the Way Home
    Cui is on the road back to his Chinese hometown.
    The road from Shaoyang to Xinhua winds tortuously around the mountainside, a misty drizzle enveloping the distant and near mountains, which are covered with lush green pines and cypresses. Crescent-shaped terraced fields surround the mountainside, high and low, the newly planted rice paddies reflecting the gloomy clouds and the shadows of the mountains... These scenes seem unusually familiar, so much like his hometown in Korea!
    The car sped along the way, but Cui, excited by the impending meeting, felt that the car was not running fast enough. He couldn't wait to step into his home, to see the father and mother who raised Luo Shengjiao. His thoughts focused again on Luo Shengjiao, who had saved him at the cost of his own life. He remembered a poem Luo Shengjiao wrote before his death:
      "When I am hit by the bullets of the invaders,
    I hope you will not stop in front of my body;
    You should continue to advance bravely,
    To avenge the millions of Korean people and the sacrificed comrades."
    "It was this noble thought that made him unhesitatingly step into the icy cave to save me and sacrifice his precious life," Cui pondered. The car swept past one rice paddy after another. This is Luo Shengjiao's hometown and also his hometown! How many times have Shengjiao's father and mother looked forward to their son's triumphant return! Now, he is returning to see them on behalf of Luo Shengjiao. How should he comfort these two old people, especially the mother's heart, when they meet...
    "Thank you, Mom"
    Cui finally met his Chinese father after seven months of separation. Old Mr. Luo was still the same as when he went to Korea, and even seemed more energetic than last year. Cui seemed to have grown taller and stronger. When Old Mr. Luo happily helped him walk towards a simple farmer's house in the suburbs of Xinhua, Luo's mother, along with her younger brother and sisters, had been waiting on the ridge in front of the house for more than half a day.
    "Mom, Mom!" Cui rushed forward and hugged his Chinese mother, saying, "Shengjiao saved me, I am your own son." Luo's mother looked at the Korean child in front of her who was so affectionately calling her mother, and after hearing his heartfelt words, a mother's warmth surged into her heart. She was so moved that she couldn't speak for a moment, and quickly held Cui's hands tightly. Deeply moved by the sincere love of his Chinese mother, Cui once again hugged Luo's mother. He then turned around and picked up the little brother who was clinging to his clothes, asking in Chinese, "How are you?" Second sister Wanxiang and third sister Liangxiang also came up, calling him brother.
    Cui stepped into the main room and saw at a glance the portrait of Luo Shengjiao, his eyes shining brightly, right in the center of the main room below the portraits of Chairman Mao and Marshal Kim Il-sung. The walls on both sides were covered with banners and satin banners presented by the people of China and Korea. As soon as Luo's mother pulled Cui down to sit, Li Yonghao, the deputy head of the Korean People's Delegation to China, stepped forward to respectfully greet her and convey the gratitude and respect of the Korean people to this Chinese mother who had selflessly dedicated her son. Deputy Head Li Yonghao held Luo's mother's hand and said, "Thank you, Mom!" At this time, Gu Fuli, a Korean model of support for the front, youth representative Jin Chenze, and combat hero Park Chan-soo also stepped forward to say the same. Luo's mother looked at Old Mr. Luo with some embarrassment. Old Mr. Luo pointed to the pennant embroidered with Korean characters on the wall and the copper bowl and copper spoon on the table and told the representatives: These were given to him by the family of martyr Park Jae-geun when he went to Korea last year. "The Korean people also saved our volunteer soldiers with their own lives," Old Mr. Luo said. At this time, Luo's mother also said with infinite gratitude: "Thanks to you for helping us block the American wolves, we can live in peace. You have suffered in the war."
    As Close as Blood Relatives
    At the dinner table, Cui sat close to his mother and younger siblings. Luo's mother kept picking up food and putting it into his bowl and plate, constantly calling, "Cui, eat, eat." Cui smiled and said in broken Chinese, "You eat, I eat, we eat together."
    He raised a glass of sweet wine and respectfully walked to his Chinese father, saying, "When I was about to leave, my father and mother in Korea told me: 'Luo Shengjiao saved you, your Chinese father and mother are just like your own parents, you must serve them well when you see them in China.' Dad, please drink this glass of wine." Then, he took out a letter and said, "This is my father's letter to my Chinese father." Old Mr. Luo happily drank the wine in one gulp, and listened attentively as he read his father's letter. Old Mr. Luo nodded constantly as he listened. He stood up and raised a glass of wine to Cui, saying, "To the health of your father and mother."
    After dinner, the whole family sat around a small square table in the inner room. The soft light of the kerosene lamp illuminated the tabletop, illuminating the happy faces of this family. Old Mr. Luo sat peacefully smoking, looking at Cui beside him with the satisfied expression of a father, looking at Wanxiang, Liangxiang, and Shengming squeezed next to Cui.
    Luo's mother took Cui's hand and told him: "I heard that you were coming during the Qingming Festival. At that time, I was visiting the grave at your grandmother's house. When I heard the news, I rushed back immediately. The neighbors, Shengjiao's good friends, also came to inquire when you would come. They helped your father clean the house inside and out. I have saved soybeans, ready to make tofu for you, and I also plan to kill a fat pig. I kept the vegetables in the garden, and steamed sweet wine. The vegetables are old, and the sweet wine is also old, but you still haven't come. I've been looking forward to it day and night, and one night I dreamed that you and Shengjiao came back together."
    Listening to his Chinese mother caring for him and loving him so much, Cui's eyes couldn't help but moisten. Cui told his mother that after he and his Chinese father separated last year, he became the class leader of the Luo Shengjiao class in their school, and the Young Pioneer detachment he led became a model detachment. He himself scored five points in seven of his eleven subjects, and four points in four subjects, and won the title of learning model. His words brought great comfort to Old Mr. Luo and Luo's mother.
      How can thousands of words be said? Still, the mother thought of the fatigue of her son who had returned from afar, so she urged Cui to accompany his father to sleep. She personally took the lamp and led them into the house, and personally made the bed for them, and after watching the father and son fall asleep, she tiptoed out.
    Their Hearts Are Always Together
    The time for separation arrived, and the delegation sent two boxes of ginseng to Old Mr. Luo and Luo's mother. Cui brought Korean clothes and materials from his parents to Luo Shengjiao's younger siblings. Luo's mother also held up a red clothing package, which contained clothes for Cui's parents and Cui, and picked up a pair of cloth shoes and handed them to Cui, saying: "These clothes are for your father and mother. These cloth shoes are made by your mother for you." Cui quickly took the clothing package and cloth shoes, saying: "Thank you for the gifts from Mom and Dad. I will always keep Mom's shoes as a souvenir, and every time I wear the shoes, I will think of Mom." Old Mr. Luo gave Cui Luo Shengjiao's elementary school graduation certificate, asking him to learn from Shengjiao's example. Cui took the diploma with both hands and said, "I must study hard and be like Shengjiao."
    After a long rain, the rice seedlings and pumpkins in the fields looked very tender green. Luo's mother stepped on the muddy road, helping Cui along the way. When she sent him to the car, she could no longer hold back her tears. "Son, when will I see you again?" She choked, as sad as she was nine years ago when she sent Shengjiao to school along the same road. "Mom, although we are temporarily separated," Cui also comforted his mother sadly: "My heart is always with Mom and Dad." Little sister Wanxiang also cried looking at her brother, and little brother Shengming's little eyes also blinked and blinked. The deputy head of the delegation and the representatives once again tightly held Luo's mother's hand, asking her to take care of her health. At this time, the crowd along the road was full of people seeing them off. Among the crowd, Liu Jizhong, an old man and family member of a volunteer soldier, murmured as he watched this scene: "I must write a letter to my son in Korea and tell him to learn from the spirit of Luo Shengjiao."

    亲如骨肉
    ——记崔?访问罗盛教故乡
    金凤
    在回家的路上
    崔?踏上他回中国家乡的路了。
    从邵阳到新化的公路曲曲折折盘旋在山腰，迷蒙的细雨笼罩着那远远近近的群山，山上长满苍翠的松柏。围着山腰高高低低布满着月牙形的梯田，刚插秧的水田中映着灰暗的阴云和群山的倒影……这些景色看来异常熟悉，多么像朝鲜的家乡啊！
    汽车一路飞驰着，可是被即将到来的会见所激动的崔?却觉得车子跑得还不够快。他恨不得一步跨到家门，看到生养了罗盛教哥哥的爸爸和妈妈。他的思想又集中到用生命救起自己的罗盛教哥哥的身
  上。他记起罗盛教生前写的一首诗：
      “当我被侵略者的子弹打中，
    希望你不要在我的尸体面前停留；
    应该继续勇敢前进，
    为千万朝鲜人民和牺牲的同志报仇。”
    “就是这样高尚的思想使他毫不犹豫地踏进冰窟中去救起我而牺牲了他宝贵的生命。”崔?沉思着。车子掠过一块又一块的水田。这是罗盛教哥哥的家乡也是他的家乡啊！盛教哥哥的爸爸、妈妈多少次盼望着自己的儿子胜利回来呀！现在，自己是代替罗盛教哥哥回来看望他们来了，见了面该怎样才能安慰这两位老人家，特别是妈妈的心呢……
    “谢谢你，妈妈”
    崔?终于和分别了七个月的中国爸爸见面了。罗老先生还是和去朝鲜时一样，而且显得比去年更有精神一些。崔?看来又长高了，也更结实一些。当罗老先生满心喜欢地搀着他走向新化城郊一所朴素的农民房子时，罗妈妈带着弟弟、妹妹在屋门前的田埂上已经等待多半天了。
    “妈妈，妈妈！”崔?抢上前去抱着他的中国妈妈，说：“盛教哥哥救起了我，我就是你亲生的儿子。”罗妈妈看着面前这般亲热地叫他妈妈的朝鲜孩子，又听了他这样贴心的话，心里涌上一股母亲的温暖。她激动得一时说不出话来，连忙紧紧拉住崔?的双手，被中国母亲这般真诚的爱所深深感动着的崔?再一次抱住了罗妈妈。他又转身抱起在他身边攀住他衣服的小弟弟，用中国话问着：“你好吗？”二妹婉香和三妹亮香也都围上来叫着哥哥。
    崔?跨进堂屋，一眼就看到在堂屋正中毛主席和金日成元帅像下面那双目炯炯的罗盛教哥哥的遗像。两旁壁上挂满了中朝两国人民赠送的锦旗和锦幛。罗妈妈刚拉着崔?坐下，朝鲜人民访华代表团副团长李永镐就走上前来尊敬地问候她的健康，并转达朝鲜人民对这位无私地献出自己儿子的中国母亲的感谢和敬意。李永镐副团长握着罗妈妈的手说：“谢谢你，妈妈！”这时，朝鲜支前模范具富力、青年代表金辰泽和战斗英雄朴赞洙也都走上来这样说。罗妈妈有些发窘地看着罗老先生。罗老先生指着墙上那幅绣着朝鲜文的锦旗和桌上那副铜碗、铜匙告诉代表们：这是他去年到朝鲜时朴在根烈士的家属送的。“朝鲜人民也同样用自己的生命救了我们志愿军，”罗老先生说。这时罗妈妈也无限感激地说道：“多亏你们帮我们挡住了美国恶狼，我们才过得安生日子。你们在战争中可受累了。”
    亲如骨肉
    在晚餐桌上，崔?紧挨着妈妈和弟弟、妹妹坐下。罗妈妈不住地夹着菜送到他的碗里和碟里，不住地叫着：“崔?，你吃啊，吃啊。”崔?笑着用不熟练的中国话说着：“你吃，我吃，一块儿吃。”
    他举起一杯甜酒恭恭敬敬走到他的中国爸爸面前说：“我临走的时候，我在朝鲜的父亲、母亲嘱咐我：‘罗盛教哥哥救起了你，你中国的爸爸、妈妈就和你亲生的父母一样，你到中国见了他们要好好侍奉他们。’爸爸，请你干了这杯酒。”说着，他又拿出一封信来说：“这是我父亲给中国爸爸的信。”罗老先生高高兴兴地一口将酒饮下，又聚精会神地听着他念父亲的来信。罗老先生一面听着，一面不住点头。他站起身举起一杯酒对崔?说：“为你父亲、母亲的健康干杯。”
    晚饭以后，一家人都坐在内堂屋一张小方桌周围。煤油灯光柔和地照射着桌面，照射着这一家人喜气洋洋的脸孔。罗老先生安详舒泰地坐着抽烟，带着做父亲的心满意足的神情看着身傍的崔?，看着挨挤在崔?身边的婉香、亮香和盛明。
    罗妈妈拉着崔?的手告诉他：“清明时节就听说你要来，那时我正在你外婆家上坟，听到消息马上赶回来。左邻右舍，盛教的好朋友也都来打听你什么时候来。他们帮你爸爸把屋里屋外打扫得干干净净。我存着黄豆，准备给你磨豆腐，还打算杀一口肥猪，我把园子里的菜留起来，又蒸起了甜酒，菜老了，甜酒也老了，你还不见来。就这样日盼夜想，有一夜竟梦见你和盛教一起回来了。”
    听着中国妈妈这般牵挂他、疼他，崔?的眼睛不禁润湿了。崔?告诉妈妈，去年他和中国爸爸分别以后，他当了他们学校罗盛教班的班长，他所领导的少年团分团成了模范分团。他自己的十一门功课有七门得五分，四门得四分，获得学习模范的称号。他的话使罗老先生和罗妈妈得到极大的安慰。
      千言万语那里说得完呢？还是妈妈想到远道回来的儿子的疲劳，便催崔?陪着他父亲去睡。她亲自拿着灯照着他们进了房子，又亲手跟他们铺好被，看着他们父子俩睡下了，才轻手轻脚退出来。
    他们的心永远在一起
    分别的时间到了，代表团送了罗老先生和罗妈妈人参两盒，崔?带来他父母送给罗盛教弟弟妹妹的朝鲜衣服和料子。罗妈妈也捧起一个红色衣包，里面是送给崔?父母和崔?的衣服，又拿起一双布鞋交给崔?说：“这些衣服送给你的父亲、母亲。这双布鞋是妈妈给你亲手做的”。崔?赶紧接过了衣包和布鞋说：“谢谢爸爸、妈妈送的礼物。妈妈的鞋我要永远留作纪念，每次穿鞋就会想起妈妈。”罗老先生交给崔?一张罗盛教小学毕业的证书，要他学习盛教哥哥的榜样。崔?双手接过文凭说：“我一定要好好学习和盛教哥哥一样。”
    久雨初晴，田里的秧苗和南瓜显得十分嫩绿。罗妈妈踏着泥泞的道路，搀着崔?送了一程又一程。当她送到汽车边时她的泪水再也止不住滚下来了。“?儿，什么时候再能见到你呢？”她哽咽着，就像九年前她沿着这同样的路送盛教去上学一样难过。“妈妈，我们虽然暂时分开”，崔?也难过地安慰着妈妈：“我的心随时都和爸爸妈妈在一起”。小妹妹婉香望着哥哥也哭起来，小弟弟盛明的小眼睛也一霎一霎的。代表团副团长和代表们又一次紧握罗妈妈的手，要她保重身体。这时，路旁挤满了送行的群众。在人丛中有一位志愿军军属老大爷刘积中看着这等情景，喃喃地说：“我一定要写信到朝鲜告诉儿子，要他好好学习罗盛教的精神”。（附图片）
