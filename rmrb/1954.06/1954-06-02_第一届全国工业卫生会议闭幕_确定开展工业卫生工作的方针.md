Xinhua News Agency, June 1st—The First National Industrial Hygiene Conference, convened by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, concluded on June 1st, after beginning on May 18th.

    Based on criticism and self-criticism, all participating representatives affirmed the achievements of industrial hygiene work since liberation; examined the shortcomings existing in the current industrial hygiene work; enhanced their understanding and unified their thinking; further clarified the great significance of actively carrying out industrial hygiene work, promoting the health of workers, and serving my country's socialist industrialization; and determined the policy that industrial hygiene work must "actively lead, advance steadily, be oriented towards production, rely on workers, and implement prevention first."
    In order to implement the policy of industrial hygiene work, the conference decided that the health departments of local people's governments must gradually strengthen the unified leadership of local industrial hygiene work. First, they must strengthen the leadership of health services in industrial and mining enterprises in a planned and step-by-step manner, assist factories and mines in carrying out environmental and personal hygiene, combine with relevant departments to study and prevent occupational diseases and common diseases, and promote advanced systems such as the workshop doctor responsibility system, so as to effectively strengthen industrial hygiene work. At the same time, leadership institutions for industrial hygiene should be strengthened according to actual needs. In factories and mines, various grassroots health organizations and workers' mass health organizations should be established and adjusted according to the number of workers and the nature of production. In order to meet the above requirements, it is necessary to strengthen research on labor hygiene, vigorously train industrial hygiene workers, and train and improve existing factory and mine health personnel. In addition, health supervision work should be gradually promoted to conduct health supervision over unsanitary conditions that seriously endanger the working people and newly built and expanded industrial enterprises and urban construction; formulate industrial enterprise health design standards in accordance with the national economic construction plan and national economic conditions; inspect and supervise the implementation of health protection measures; conduct regular health supervision on the basis of health and epidemic prevention work, and gradually and selectively carry out preventive health supervision work.
    In order to ensure the completion of the above tasks, the conference called on all health workers: to strive to improve their socialist ideological consciousness and strengthen their political sense of responsibility for serving national economic construction; all health workers should, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party organization and the People's Government, strengthen unity and closely cooperate with relevant departments of the People's Government and relevant people's organizations to carry out industrial hygiene work; establish a viewpoint of serving production, go deep into workshops and construction sites, understand the production process, and closely integrate health work with production tasks; rely on workers, constantly carry out health propaganda and education to workers, improve the level of health knowledge among the masses of workers, implement the policy of prevention first, and correct the working viewpoints and working methods of pure treatment; vigorously learn from advanced Soviet medicine, and constantly improve industrial hygiene work according to advanced Soviet experience.
