    Throughout the country, state-led rural grain markets are being actively established. According to incomplete statistics from May, over 15,000 of these new types of grain markets have been established across various regions. Provinces with a more widespread establishment of grain markets, such as Shanxi Province, already have over 1,000 state grain markets. Because these grain markets do not involve private grain merchants, they possess many excellent characteristics. Farmers in places like Pei County, Jiangsu Province, say these markets have three advantages: "Fair scales and measures, reasonable prices, and convenient transactions."

    Since the establishment of state grain markets in various regions, farmers can sell surplus grain, adjust grain varieties, and purchase food grain and seeds in these markets, thereby supporting agricultural and sideline production. After selling surplus grain in the grain market, farmers in Panlong Township, Wu乡 County, Shanxi Province, added 21 head of draft animals. During the spring plowing season, farmers in Longtan Township, Xuanwei County, Yunnan Province, adjusted over 1,800 jin of seeds per market session at the state grain market. From April 25th to May 7th, the Chengguan Grain Market in Qianjiang County, Hubei Province, transacted over 11,000 jin of grain, with more than 600 farmers mutually adjusting their grain supplies. Farmers in many regions have also purchased pig feed at the grain markets. Many flour mills, tofu workshops, and other establishments in rural market towns have purchased raw materials at the grain markets. The transaction in rural markets in Shanxi, Henan and other places are becoming more active, driven by the state grain market.

    In well-organized and managed state grain markets, the volume of grain transactions gradually increases. In these areas, the quantity of grain supplied by the state has relatively decreased. One month after the establishment of the state grain market in Chengxiang Town, Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, the volume of grain transactions increased from an average of over 2,300 jin per day at the beginning to over 13,000 jin. In the Xiaoqiu District of Yao County, Shaanxi Province, the quantity of grain sold by the state in April was more than 50,000 jin. In May, due to farmers mutually adjusting large quantities of grain in the grain market, it decreased to over 9,900 jin. The state purchased the remaining grain after mutual adjustments by the farmers, according to the farmers' requests. May is precisely the time when grain is scarce in most areas. During this month, state-owned grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives nationwide purchased more than 800 million jin of grain.

    各地农村大量建立国家粮食市场
    便利农民调剂粮食支持了农业生产
    【本报讯】全国各地积极建立由国家领导的农村粮食市场，据五月份的不完全统计，各地已建立起来的这种新型粮食市场有一万五千多个。建立粮食市场比较普遍的省份，如山西省已有国家粮食市场一千个以上。这些粮食市场因为没有私营粮商参加，具有许多优良的特点。江苏省沛县等地的农民说这种市场有三好：“秤斗公平，价格公道，买卖便利”。
    各地建立国家粮食市场以后，农民可以在这些市场上卖出存粮，调剂粮食品种和购买口粮、种籽等，因而支持了农、副业生产。山西省武乡县蟠龙乡农民在粮食市场上卖出存粮后，即添置了二十一头耕畜。在春耕生产期间，云南省宣威县龙潭乡农民在国家粮食市场上，每场调剂的种籽有一千八百多斤。湖北省潜江县城关粮食市场在四月二十五日到五月七日的十三天中，共成交粮食一万一千多斤，有六百多个农民互相调剂了粮食。许多地区的农民还在粮食市场上买到了养猪饲料。各地农村集镇的许多粉坊、豆腐坊等在粮食市场上买到了原料。山西、河南等地的农村交易市场，在国家粮食市场的带动下，交易更形活跃。
    在组织和管理得好的国家粮食市场上，粮食交易量都逐渐增加。在这些地区，国家供应粮食的数量相对地都有所减少。浙江省萧山县城厢镇建立国家粮食市场一个月后，粮食交易量由开始时平均每天二千三百多斤增加到一万三千多斤。陕西省耀县小丘区国家销售粮食的数量，四月份为五万多斤，五月份由于农民在粮食市场上互相调剂了大批粮食，便减少到九千九百多斤。农民互相调剂以后剩余的粮食，国家根据农民的要求进行了收购。五月份正是大部地区粮食青黄不接的时候，这个月内，全国国营粮食部门和供销合作社收购的粮食达八亿多斤。
