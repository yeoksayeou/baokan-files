Experience in the Work of the Youth Shock Brigade at the Soviet Exhibition Hall Construction Site
Chinese New Democratic Youth League Beijing Municipal Committee

On October 15, 1953, the construction of the large-scale Soviet Exhibition Hall commenced in the western suburbs of Beijing. The exhibition hall has a construction area of over 44,000 square meters and a volume of over 313,000 cubic meters. The main projects of the entire hall include: the central hall with an octagonal dome; the vaulted industrial hall; the huge cultural and agricultural halls; an open-air theater with a capacity of over 2,700 people; cinemas, and restaurants, etc. This project was urgent and significant, and the entire construction site was working intensely to ensure the task was completed on schedule.

Thanks to the strengthening of leadership by the Party and administrative authorities, and the direct assistance of Soviet experts, the exhibition hall construction site established work plans in production management, promoted the team contracting system, and generally issued task lists when assigning tasks. The entire construction site had over 4,000 workers, including over 2,000 young workers and 900 Youth League members. Under the education of the Party, their political and ideological awareness was increasing daily, and they wanted to contribute more of their strength to production. At the same time, although the labor productivity of the construction site had improved, there was still great potential. These were the conditions for establishing a youth shock brigade.

	The Establishment of the First Youth Shock Brigade

January 1954 was the most intense phase of winter construction, with the main task being to complete 6,000 cubic meters of concrete structure work. The key lay with the carpenters who built the formwork. The construction site Party committee issued a call to the workers: to further improve labor productivity and accelerate progress while ensuring quality. At this time, Soviet experts suggested organizing a youth shock brigade. The Youth League committee conducted a specific investigation into the political and technical situation of the young workers, and the Party committee discussed and decided to establish one. Based on the principle of voluntarism, eighteen young League members with relatively good technical skills were selected, and the first carpentry youth shock brigade was established on January 13.

The carpentry shock brigade showed a high degree of enthusiasm from the start. They completed the cement chute, which was planned to take seven hours, in less than three hours; they completed 180 props, which were planned to take two days, in one day; and they supported three carpentry groups, including Zhou Fugen's, in completing their January plans. The main key to construction in February was the vaulting of the industrial hall. The vault spanned 32 meters and included twelve vault beams, which was technically complex and time-sensitive. Some carpentry groups initially only wanted to support one vault beam formwork. At this time, the shock brigade took the lead in undertaking three vault beam formworks, driving other carpentry groups to accept the entire task. The youth shock brigade and the model group of veteran technician Dai Arong launched a competition, completing the task planned for 478.4 work units with 181.4 work units (standard work units). Each carpentry group also increased production efficiency by more than double on average, enabling the entire vault project to be completed two days ahead of schedule. At this time, the views of many people who originally did not believe that the shock brigade could complete the task changed, and they thought "these young fellows are really capable." The youth shock brigade began to gain the trust of the masses.

	The Development of the Youth Shock Brigade and its Role in Production

In late February, the No. 2 and 3 construction sites began bricklaying. At that time, the quota for each person per day was 680 bricks (due to the construction of large window piers, with many corners and cylindrical columns), but the average efficiency always remained at 400-500 bricks. The Party committee and administration convened a "Bricklayer Activist Meeting" calling on everyone to reach and break the quota. As a result, two bricklaying youth shock brigades were established. On the first day, they each laid more than 900 bricks. In March, the production time was changed to nine hours, and the quota was changed to 800 bricks. Through competition, the Wang Wenfu shock brigade achieved an average of 1,509 bricks per person; the Shen Mao Du shock brigade achieved an average of 1,437 bricks per person; and drove the average of each bricklaying group to about 1,000 bricks per person. The persons in charge of most construction sites proposed to establish youth shock brigades in their own construction sites, believing that "this would be more secure for completing the task."

However, due to insufficient publicity, some comrades were not clear about the purpose of establishing shock brigades, and some individuals even said sarcastic remarks to shock brigade members. After the Party committee understood these situations, it promptly instructed all departments to pay attention to publicizing the purpose and significance of establishing shock brigades, and asked everyone to value and support them. In late March, in conjunction with the newly established four shock brigades (plastering, electrical, plumbing, and concrete, one each), the administration and the Youth League committee convened a "Youth Shock Brigade Establishment Conference," inviting all cadres and workers to participate. At the meeting, the heads of the Party, government, labor union, Youth League, and Soviet experts all spoke, formally announcing the establishment of the shock brigades. After the meeting, many young workers asked to join the shock brigades, or expressed their intention to learn from the shock brigades in their work. Many adult workers also took the initiative to care for and help the shock brigades, such as master craftsmen Dai Arong, Li Jinfang, Gu Donglin, etc. who all shared their operating experience with the shock brigade members.

With the needs of production, tinplate, machine, construction worker and two plastering youth shock brigades were soon established. Some teams selected production groups with a majority of young people, made individual adjustments based on political and technical conditions, and after education, named them youth shock brigades. Special attention was also paid to equipping the shock brigades with political backbones and individual skilled adult workers. The twelve youth shock brigades that were established one after another constantly created new achievements. For example, the electrical team installed wiring pipes in the central hall, increasing efficiency by 156 percent; the plastering team plastered the interior walls of the cinema lounge, increasing efficiency by 34 percent; the concrete team excavated sand exceeding the quota by one and a half times; the tinplate team used advanced tight-fitting tools, increasing efficiency seven times. In April, the labor productivity of all types of work at the entire construction site increased by an average of 30 to 40 percent, naturally, this was mainly due to the leadership of the Party and the strengthening of various aspects of work, and the youth shock brigade did play a promoting role.

In early April, due to the suggestion of the person in charge of the No. 1 construction site, the Party committee discussed and decided to hand over the urgent task of building the open-air theater to young workers, and named this section of work the "Youth Work Section" (with some adult technicians), enhancing technical equipment. The "Youth Work Section" concentrated eight shock brigades, including carpentry, bricklaying, and machining teams, in the structural engineering. Together with other groups, they set out work plans, organized challenges within the same types of work, and mutually proposed guarantee conditions among related types of work, launching a larger-scale labor competition. This not only inspired the labor enthusiasm of all young workers, but also closely coordinated the cooperation between various types of work, which had a great effect on comprehensively improving labor productivity and accelerating the progress of the entire project. Now all the staff of the Youth Work Section have completed the original five-month task in 55 working days.

	How the Youth Shock Brigade Broke Through the Production Quota

The youth shock brigades were all voluntarily formed by activists with a certain level of awareness, and the shock brigade members all regarded the establishment of the youth shock brigade as the Party and the state's trust and love for them. They said, "We must never disgrace this glorious title, and we must actually set an example." Especially after the establishment of the team, the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League strengthened their leadership and education, which further consolidated and enhanced their collective sense of honor and responsibility.

This collective sense of honor and responsibility greatly stimulated their labor enthusiasm and production enthusiasm. For example, after the carpentry shock brigade accepted the task, the members were discussing in the dormitory and canteen how to complete the task ahead of schedule. Member Li Bohua injured his finger, but insisted on helping to transport and cut materials. Female machinist shock brigade member Hu Shulan insisted on operating the mixer in the rain, ensuring the smooth progress of the cement mixing task.

This collective sense of honor and responsibility prompted them to carefully study work methods, improve labor organization, and rationally use labor. For example, the carpentry shock brigade established three dedicated groups according to the types of vault formwork operations, two groups supported the beam formwork from both sides, and one group supported the roof frame, and cooperated with the rebar workers and electricians to implement assembly line operations. The plastering team established three groups according to the job requirements and the technical conditions of the members, and divided the work to be responsible for plastering the vertical walls, rushing tendons, flattening the tops, taking photos and gray lines. The plumbing team also implemented the division of labor for tying hemp, aligning openings, and installing. This reasonable division of labor and cooperation fully utilized the technical capabilities of each member and improved labor productivity.

This collective sense of honor and responsibility prompted them to use their brains, find tricks, and continuously improve technical operating methods and production tools. For example, the carpentry shock brigade researched the method of using elevation benchmarks and axes to determine the position of the vault beam formwork; the bricklayer shock brigade successfully tried using a paving machine to lay cement slurry. Machinist shock brigade members tried to prepare and repair mechanical parts such as automatic water addition and timed ash discharge of the mixer; the plumbing team changed the caulking tool to a concave round head and widened it by one time. These improvements have played a significant role in improving labor productivity.

	The Significance of Establishing a Youth Shock Brigade for Educating Young Workers

In their work, the youth shock brigade members strictly demanded themselves, were not afraid of difficulties, cherished state property, observed labor discipline, were more united and helped each other, and carried out criticism and self-criticism, thereby improving their communist awareness. For example, carpentry shock brigade member Xu Jin Di said, "In the past, I thought it was enough for me to do my job well, but now I realize that it is necessary for everyone to do well in order to complete the task well." A few members of the bricklayer shock brigade were not active in doing odd jobs, and the Youth League group leader promptly convened a meeting to discuss and quickly improve. Every time the bricklayer shock brigade members got off work, they had to use up all the mortar before leaving. Once, when their own team's task was completed, they went to lay bricks for another group. In recent months, due to the continuous improvement of awareness, many members have asked to join the Youth League and the Party.

In order to continuously improve labor productivity, it has also promoted the shock brigade members' urgent demand to improve their skills. The carpentry shock brigade members actively studied drawings, and the plumbing shock brigade members worked hard to learn gas welding. The shock brigades generally established daily production meetings and weekly technical research meetings, and often asked master craftsmen and technicians to explain techniques and operating experience. The plumbing shock brigade also established a relatively systematic technical learning system.

The positive performance of the shock brigade members set an example for the youth of the entire construction site. They said, "We are also young people, why can't we overcome difficulties." After the electrician shock brigade overfulfilled the task by 156 percent, many young electricians proposed: "We must catch up." Many groups have improved their production efficiency, such as the Wang Fengtong group which improved efficiency by 56 percent, and some young workers have overcome the phenomenon of being late and leaving early.

	How to Lead the Youth Shock Brigade

(1) Closely rely on the leadership of the Party and government. The youth shock brigade is a production organization, which is an effective form of organizing youth to participate in labor competition and educating youth in the spirit of communism according to the characteristics of youth. Only under the leadership of the Party and government can the youth shock brigade play its due role along the right direction. The establishment of the youth shock brigade should be based on the needs of production, and should not pursue the quantity of team building apart from the needs of production. The youth shock brigade must carry out production under the unified management and command of the administration, in order to avoid neglecting quality, safety, and other issues. After the establishment of the shock brigade, the Party committee of the exhibition hall construction site carried out a series of work, such as unifying the thinking of cadres, publicizing the purpose and significance of establishing the shock brigade to all employees, and strengthening the regular leadership of the shock brigade and competition work. The administration gave great support and assistance to the shock brigade in terms of transferring manpower, assigning tasks, and providing technical guidance. This ensured the smooth development of the shock brigade's work.

(2) Actively participate in labor competitions under the unified plan of the labor union. The youth shock brigade is also a unit of the labor union organization, and the production activities of the shock brigade are also part of the entire labor competition. The Youth League organization must closely cooperate with the labor union, guide the shock brigade to actively participate in the labor competition movement, and strengthen the unity of the shock brigade members and adult workers. The Youth League organization of the exhibition hall construction site, with the help of the labor union, and together with the labor union jointly studied the competition between the shock brigade and other groups, helped the shock brigade to formulate competition conditions, jointly convened the Youth Workers' Congress, and carried out publicity and mobilization work among all workers. This approach has received good results.

(3) Strengthen the work of the Youth League organization. The Youth League organization must strengthen the leadership of the shock brigade and help them continuously improve their political and ideological awareness and technical level. Educate them to take the lead in learning advanced experience, pay attention to project quality, and ensure safe production; educate them not to be arrogant or impetuous, and humbly learn from adult workers; help them establish the necessary political learning system, and educate League members to play an exemplary role in the shock brigade. In terms of technical learning, take the initiative to seek the help of master craftsmen and technicians, ask them to impart operating experience in combination with production needs, and establish a more systematic learning system under possible conditions.

While strengthening the work of the shock brigade, the Youth League organization must also pay attention to attracting all League members and young workers to participate in the labor competition. In the early stage of the establishment of the shock brigade, some Youth League cadres relaxed their leadership over ordinary League members and young people, which caused dissatisfaction among some League members and young people. The Youth League organization promptly discovered this problem, and later often publicized the advanced ideas and deeds of the shock brigade, introduced the experience of the shock brigade through methods such as wall newspapers, broadcasts, and Youth Workers' Congresses, and educated all League members and young people to complete the task in the spirit of the shock brigade. Only in this way can the shock brigade effectively drive all League members and young people to play an active role in the labor competition.

    苏联展览馆工区青年突击队工作经验
    中国新民主主义青年团北京市委员会
    一九五三年十月十五日，规模宏大的苏联展览馆建筑工程在北京西郊开工兴建。展览馆建筑面积为四万四千多平方公尺，体积为三十一万三千多立方公尺。全馆主要工程有：八角穹顶的中央大厅；拱顶的工业馆；巨大的文化馆和农业馆；可容二千七百多人的露天剧场；电影院和餐厅等。这一工程是紧急和重大的，全工区都在为保证按期完成任务而紧张地工作着。
    由于党和行政领导的加强，苏联专家的直接帮助，展览馆工区在生产管理上建立了作业计划，推行了小组包工制，一般做到在分配任务时下达任务单等。全工区有四千多工人，其中有二千多青年工人，团员九百人。他们在党的教育下，政治思想觉悟日益提高，要求在生产上更多地贡献出自己的力量。同时，工区的劳动生产率虽有提高，但潜力还很大。这是建立青年突击队的条件。
      第一个青年突击队的建立
      一九五四年一月份是冬季施工最紧张的阶段，主要任务是要完成六千立方公尺的混凝土结构工程。关键在于支模板的木工。工区党委向工人提出了号召：进一步提高劳动生产率，在保证质量的前提下加速进度。这时，苏联专家提出组织青年突击队的建议。团委对青年工人的政治和技术情况作了具体调查，党委进行了讨论，决定建立。根据自愿的原则，选择了十八名技术上比较好的青年团员，在一月十三日，建立了第一个木工青年突击队。
    木工突击队一开始就表现了高度的积极性，他们不到三小时就完成了计划七小时做完的水泥溜槽；一天便完成了计划用两天做完的一百八十根撑
  头；支援周福根等三个木工组完成了一月份的计划。二月份施工的主要关键在于工业馆的拱顶工程。拱顶跨度三十二公尺，包括十二个拱顶大梁，
  技术复杂，期限很紧。有些木工组开始只愿支一个拱顶大梁模板，这时突击队带头承做三个拱顶大梁
  模板，带动其他木工组接受了全部任务。青年突击
  队和老技工戴阿荣模范组带头展开了竞赛，以一八
  一点四工（标准工）完成了计划用四七八点四工的任务。各木工组也平均提高了生产效率一倍多，使整个拱顶工程提前两天完工。这时，许多原来不相信突击队能完成任务的人的看法改变了，认为“小伙子还真能干”。青年突击队开始得到了群众的信任。
      青年突击队的发展和在生产
        上的作用
    二月下旬，二、三工号开始砌砖，当时每人每天的定额是六百八十块（因系砌大窗垛，角多，有圆柱），但平均效率总停留在四、五百块上。党委和行政召开了“瓦工积极分子会”，号召大家达到并突破定额。于是，两个瓦工青年突击队成立起来了。第一天他们每人便砌了九百多块。三月份生产时间改为九小时，定额改为八百块。通过竞赛，王文福突击队达到平均每人一千五百零九块；沈毛杜突击队达到平均每人一千四百三十七块；并带动各瓦工组平均达到每人砌砖一千块左右。多数工号的负责人都提出要在自己的工号建立青年突击队，认为“这样对完成任务就更有把握了”。
    但是由于宣传不够，有些同志对建立突击队的目的认识不明确，个别人还对突击队员说讽刺话。党委了解这些情况后，及时指示各部门注意宣传建立突击队的目的和意义，要求大家重视和支持。在三月下旬结合新建立四个突击队（抹灰、电气、水暖、混凝土各一个），由行政和团委召开“青年突击队建队大会”，邀请全体干部和工人参加，会上党、政、工、团的负责人和苏联专家都讲了话，正式宣布突击队成立。会后，许多青年工人要求参加突击队，或表示在劳动中要向突击队看齐。许多成年工人也主动关心和帮助突击队，如老师傅戴阿荣、李锦芳、顾东林等都给突击队员讲操作经验。
    随着生产的需要，不久又成立了白铁、机器、壮工和两个抹灰青年突击队。有些队是选择了青年占多数的生产小组，根据政治和技术的条件做了个别调整，经过教育，命名为青年突击队的。并特别注意配备了突击队的政治骨干和个别技术熟练的成年
  工人。先后成立的十二个青年突击队都不断地创造了新的成绩。如电气队安中央大厅线管，提高效率百分之一百五十六；抹灰队抹电影院休息室内墙，提高效率百分之三十四；混凝土队掏沙超过定额一倍半；白铁队使用了先进紧口工具，提高效率七倍。四月份全工区各工种的劳动生产率平均提高了百分之三十到四十，自然这主要是由于党的领导和各方面工作的加强，青年突击队也确实起了推动作用。
    四月初，由于一工号负责人的建议，党委讨论决定把建筑露天剧场的紧急任务交给青年工人来完成，并把这一工段命名为“青年工段”（内有部分成年技工），增强了技术设备。“青年工段”在结构工程中，集中了木工、瓦工、机工等八个突击队，他们和其他小组一起订出作业计划，在同工种中组织了挑战应战，在联系工种中相互提出保证条件，展开了规模较大的劳动竞赛。这样不但鼓舞了全体青年工人的劳动热情，而且密切了各工种之间的配合，对全面提高劳动生产率，加速整个工程的进度有很大的作用，现在青年工段的全体职工已经以五十五个工作日完成了原计划五个月的任务。
    青年突击队是怎样突破生产
        定额的
    青年突击队都是具有一定觉悟的积极分子志愿组成的，突击队员们都把建立青年突击队看做是党和国家对他们的信任和爱护。他们说：“绝不能辱没这一光荣称号，要实际上做出样子来。”特别是建队以后，党、政、工、团加强了对他们的领导和教育，这就更加巩固和增强了他们集体的荣誉感和责任感。
    这种集体的荣誉感和责任感，大大激发了他们的劳动热情和生产积极性。如木工突击队接受任务后，在宿舍和食堂里，队员们都在讨论怎样才能提前完成任务。队员李伯华伤了手指，还坚持帮助运料、截料。女机工突击队员胡淑兰在雨中坚持掌握搅拌机的工作，保证了打水泥任务的顺利进行。
    这种集体的荣誉感和责任感，促使他们认真钻研作业方法，改善劳动组织，合理使用劳动力。如木工突击队按照拱顶模板作业的类别，成立了三个专责小组，两组从两面支大梁模板，一组支屋架，并和钢筋工、电工配合，实行流水作业。抹灰队按作业要求和队员技术条件成立了三个小组，分工负责抹立墙、冲筋、平顶、照面和灰线的工作。水暖队也实行了扎麻、对口和安装的分工流水作业。这样合理的分工合作，充分发挥了每个队员的技术能力，提高了劳动生产效率。
    这种集体的荣誉感和责任感，促使他们开动脑筋，找窍门，不断改进了技术操作方法和生产工具。如木工突击队研究出用量标高和轴线来测定拱顶大梁模板位置的办法；瓦工突击队试用铺灰器铺水泥浆成功。机工突击队员设法配制和修复了搅拌机的自动加水、定时出灰等机械零件；水暖队把捻凿工具改成凹圆头，并加宽一倍。这些改进，对提高劳动生产率都起了很大的作用。建立青年突击队对教育青年
  工人的意义
    青年突击队员在劳动中，严格要求自己，不怕困难，爱护国家财物，遵守劳动纪律，更加团结互助，展开批评和自我批评，从而也就提高了他们的共产主义觉悟。如木工突击队员徐金弟说：“过去以为自己工作好就行了，现在认识到非大家都干得好才能很好地完成任务。”瓦工突击队少数队员干零活不积极，团小组长就及时召集会议进行讨论，迅速得到改进。瓦工突击队员每次下班时都要把所有灰浆全都用完才走，有一次本队任务已完，便去给别组砌。几月来，由于觉悟不断提高，已有不少队员要求入团入党。
    为着不断提高劳动生产率，也促进了突击队员对提高技术的迫切要求。木工突击队员积极学习图纸，水暖突击队员们努力学习着汽焊。突击队一般地都建立了每天的生产碰头会、每周的技术研究会，经常请老师傅和技术员讲解技术和操作经验。水暖突击队还建立了比较系统的技术学习制度。
    突击队员的积极表现，给全工区的青年树立了榜样。他们说：“咱们也是青年，为什么就不能克服困难。”电工突击队超额百分之一百五十六完成了任务后，许多青年电工提出：“一定要赶上去。”不少小组都提高了生产效率，如王凤桐小组就提高了效率百分之五十六，有的青年工人克服了迟到、早退的现象。
      怎样领导青年突击队
      （一）紧密依靠党、政的领导。青年突击队是生产组织，它是按照青年特点，组织青年参加劳动竞赛和以共产主义精神教育青年的一种有效形式。只有在党、政的领导下，青年突击队才能沿着正确的方向发挥其应有的作用。建立青年突击队要按照生产的需要，不能离开生产需要追求建队的数量。青年突击队要在行政统一管理和指挥下进行生产，才能避免忽视质量、安全等问题。展览馆工区党委在建立突击队之后，进行了一系列的工作，如统一干部思想，向全体职工宣传建立突击队的目的和意义，加强对突击队和竞赛工作的经常领导等。行政在抽调人力、分配任务和在技术指导上，都大力给突击队以支持和帮助。保证了突击队工作的顺利发展。
    （二）在工会的统一计划下积极参加劳动竞赛。青年突击队也是工会组织的一个单位，突击队的生产活动也是整个劳动竞赛的一部分。团组织要和工会密切合作，引导突击队积极参加劳动竞赛运动，加强突击队员和成年工人的团结。展览馆工区团组织在工会的帮助下，并和工会在一起共同研究突击队和其他小组的竞赛问题，帮助突击队拟定竞赛条件，共同召开青工大会，和在全体工人中展开宣传鼓动工作等。这种作法收到了很好的效果。
      （三）加强团组织的工作。团组织要加强对突击队的领导，帮助他们不断提高政治思想觉悟和技术水平。教育他们带头学习先进经验，注意工程质量，保证安全生产；教育他们不骄不躁，虚心向成年工人学习；帮助他们建立必要的政治学习制度，教育团员在突击队中起模范作用。在技术学习方面，要主动争取老师傅和技术人员的帮助，请他们结合生产需要传授操作经验，并在可能条件下建立比较系统的学习制度。
    在加强突击队工作的同时，团组织还必须注意吸引全体团员和青工参加劳动竞赛。工区在建立突击队初期，有些团的干部曾放松了对一般团员、青年的领导，引起一些团员、青年不满。团组织及时发现了这个问题，以后经常通过壁报、广播和青工大会等方式宣传突击队的先进思想和事迹，介绍突击队的经验，并教育全体团员和青年要以突击队的精神来完成任务。只有这样，突击队才能够有效地带动全体团员、青年在劳动竞赛中发挥积极作用。
