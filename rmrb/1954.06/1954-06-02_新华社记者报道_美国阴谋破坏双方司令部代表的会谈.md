    **US Conspiracy to Sabotage Talks Between Representatives of Both Headquarters**

    [Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 31st] (Special Correspondent Report) Just as the restricted conference on the Indochina issue had just reached an agreement on the talks between representatives of both headquarters, the US delegation declared to the press on May 30th that the United States would reserve the right not to accept any recommendations that the representatives of both headquarters might make in the future. According to information obtained here, after the British delegation's proposal was passed at the restricted meeting on May 29th, the US representative stated at the meeting that he had received instructions from the US government authorizing him to adopt a reserved attitude of "neither accepting nor opposing" the principles stipulated in the proposal. It is understood that the British and French representatives at the time expressed impatience with Smith's attitude.

    The attitude of the US delegation reflects, to some extent, that the US is no longer able to control the progress of the conference as it wishes, and also reflects that the US policy of obstructing the progress of the conference has been frustrated.

    As everyone knows, from the first day of the Geneva Conference, the US has been trying its best to prevent the conference from making any real progress. Responsible persons in the US have long said that the US agreed to convene this conference just to prove that it could not succeed. During the conference, the US used various means to pressure its Western allies to accept the policy of continuing and expanding the Indochina war, and to pressure more countries to organize a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc according to the intentions of the US. The US propaganda machine has also continuously spread pessimistic views that the Geneva Conference will fail.

    However, the people of all countries who are concerned about the restoration of peace in Indochina do not allow the Geneva Conference to be sabotaged. The war plans of the US have been repeatedly opposed and criticized by public opinion in various countries, and have also been met with indifference by some Western countries. With the persistent efforts of the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China, the Geneva Conference has not developed according to the predetermined route of the US, and the conference is slowly but gradually making progress. The principles for achieving a ceasefire recently put forward by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have further strengthened people's hope for reaching an agreement at the conference.

    Thus, US diplomats find themselves in a difficult situation: agreeing to talks between representatives of both headquarters on the ceasefire issue is not in line with US policy; openly opposing this agreement, which has been accepted by everyone, runs the risk of further isolation. "Neither accepting nor opposing" is precisely the self-portrait of the awkward face of US diplomats.

    However, what is more important is the sinister plot to further undermine the Geneva Conference contained in the instructions from Washington announced by the US representative.

    Observers here point out that this is not the first time that the US delegation has adopted a reserved attitude or refused to express an attitude when the conference discusses major issues related to the restoration of peace in Indochina. On the issue of joint guarantees by the countries concerned participating in the Geneva Conference for a ceasefire in Indochina, the US delegation adopted a reserved attitude to avoid assuming this obligation; the US also remained silent on the important proposal put forward by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to stop the transportation of troops and military supplies from outside Indochina; even on the issue of demarcating troop concentration areas and adjusting areas, the US adopted an ambiguous attitude. Now, the "reserved attitude" of the US delegation has been further developed. The US has also adopted a reserved attitude towards the talks between representatives of both headquarters unanimously agreed upon at the conference, and has reserved the right not to accept the recommendations that this meeting may make in advance. One can imagine that the US policy is to reserve the right not to accept any agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina that may be reached at the Geneva Conference.

    What does it mean to reserve the right not to accept the recommendations that both parties may make in advance?

    This means that a country can warn others in advance at an international conference that they must act according to its will, otherwise it will not accept it. Even if the two parties directly concerned agree, even if everyone agrees, as long as the US does not agree, it does not count, and the US is not bound by anything. The US can act individually. From this, it is not difficult to see the arrogant and arbitrary, self-centered attitude of the US towards international affairs.

    It is now becoming increasingly clear that the basic line of the US authorities at the Geneva Conference is to do everything possible to prevent any agreement from being reached, and if this cannot be done, to adopt a policy of non-recognition.

    Obviously, the US is attempting to exert pressure on the upcoming talks between the representatives of both headquarters, not allowing them to make any recommendations conducive to the restoration of peace in Indochina, and threatening them with US non-recognition.

    The British "Socialist Leader" weekly wrote on May 28th: "The United States came to the Geneva Conference with the determination to sabotage it. Dulles's task is to coerce European countries to pursue a policy and ensure support for the US veto of any actual agreement."

    At the same time, the US is conducting intense activities outside the Geneva Conference in order to further expand the Indochina war. The US is actively encouraging Thailand to raise the Indochina issue to the United Nations in order to use the UN's signboard to cover up the US's criminal intervention. US newspapers are vigorously talking about what the US is prepared to do if the Geneva Conference fails. US generals are also clamoring that the US should participate in the Indochina war under "unrestricted" conditions.

    However, today is no longer an era when one country can act arbitrarily. As long as the world's peace forces do not relax their efforts in the slightest, the proponents of "power politics" will inevitably be battered and bloodied.

### 新华社记者报道  美国阴谋破坏双方司令部代表的会谈

    美国阴谋破坏双方司令部代表的会谈
    【新华社日内瓦五月三十一日电】本社特派记者报道：正当讨论印度支那问题的限制性会议就双方司令部的代表会谈问题刚刚取得了协议的时候，美国代表团在五月三十日向报界声称，对于双方司令部代表将来可能作出的建议，美国将保留不予接受的权利。根据此间得到的消息，在五月二十九日的限制性会议上通过了英国代表团的建议之后，美国代表曾在会上声明它接到美国政府的指令，授权他对这个建议中所规定的原则采取“既不接受也不反对”的保留态度。据悉，当时的英国和法国的代表曾对史密斯的这种态度表现了不耐烦。
    美国代表团的这种态度在一定的意义上反映了美国已不能如意地控制会议进程，也反映了美国阻挠会议获得进展的政策遭到挫折。
    大家知道，从日内瓦会议的第一天起，美国就竭力阻挠会议取得任何真正的进展。美国的负责人士早就说过，美国同意召开这个会议，就是为了证明它不能成功。在会议进行期间，美国使用了种种手段来压迫它的西方盟国接受继续和扩大印度支那战争的政策，并压迫更多的国家按照美国的意图组织东南亚侵略集团。美国的宣传机器也接连不断地散布日内瓦会议将告失败的悲观空气。
    然而，关心恢复印度支那和平的各国人民不容许日内瓦会议遭到破坏，美国的战争计划一再遭到了各国舆论的反对和抨击，也受到了某些西方国家的冷淡。在越南民主共和国、苏联和中国代表团的坚持努力之下，日内瓦会议并没有按照美国的既定路线发展，会议正在缓慢地但逐步地获得进展。越南民主共和国最近提出的实现停火的原则，进一步加强了人们对于会议取得协议的希望。
    就这样，美国的外交家们发现自己处于一种困难的境地：同意双方司令部的代表就停火问题举行会谈，那是不符合美国政策的；公开反对这个已为大家所接受的协议，又有陷于进一步孤立的危险。“既不接受也不反对”正是美国外交家尴尬面貌的自我刻划。
    然而，更重要的是在美国代表所宣布的来自华盛顿的指令里所包含的进一步破坏日内瓦会议的阴险祸心。
    此间观察家指出，美国代表团在会议讨论有关恢复印度支那和平的重大问题时，采取保留态度或者拒绝表示态度，这已不是第一次了。在参加日内瓦会议的有关国家共同保证印度支那停战的问题上，美国代表团就采取了避免承担这个义务的保留态度；对于越南民主共和国所提出的停止从印度支那境外运入军队和军火的重要建议，美国也保持缄默；甚至对于划定军队集结地区和调整区域这个问题，美国也采取暧昧的态度。现在，美国代表团的“保留态度”又有了进一步的发展。美国对于会议一致同意的双方司令部的代表会谈，也采取保留的态度了，而且事先就对这个会谈可能作出的建议，保留不予接受的权利。人们可以设想，美国的政策是对日内瓦会议可能达成的恢复印度支那和平的任何协议，都保留不予接受的权利的。
    事先就对双方可能作出的建议保留不予接受的权利，这是什么意思呢？
    这就是说，一个国家在国际会议上，可以事先就警告别人必须按照它的意志办事，否则它就不接受。即使直接有关双方都同意了，即使大家都同意了，只要美国不同意，就不算数，美国就不受任何约束，美国就可以个别行动。从这里不难看出，美国对于国际事务所采取的专横独断、唯我独尊的态度。
    人们现在已越来越清楚地看到，美国当局对日内瓦会议的基本路线是尽一切力量阻挠达成任何协议，如果做不到这一点，就采取不承认的政策。
    显然美国正是企图对即将开始的双方司令部的代表的会谈使用压力，不许他们作出任何有利于恢复印度支那和平的建议，并以美国的不承认进行威胁。
    英国“社会主义先驱”周刊在五月二十八日写道：“美国是抱着破坏日内瓦会议的决心来参加会议的。杜勒斯的任务就是胁迫欧洲国家奉行一个方针，并保证支持美国对任何实际协议的否决权。”
    同时，美国正在日内瓦会议的外面进行着紧张的活动，以便进一步扩大印度支那战争。美国正积极怂恿泰国向联合国提出印度支那问题，以便利用联合国的招牌来掩饰美国的罪恶的干涉。美国报纸正在起劲地谈论着一旦日内瓦会议失败，美国准备干些什么。美国的将军们也正在叫嚣美国应该在 “不受任何限制”的条件下，参加印度支那战争。
    然而，今天已经不是一个国家可以横行霸道的时代了，只要世界和平力量丝毫也不放松努力，
  “实力政策”的主张者必定要碰得头破血流的。
