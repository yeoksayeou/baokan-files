Short Commentary

    On June 23rd, the U.S. Navy actually launched an armed attack on the Soviet merchant ship "Tuapse" in the high seas south of Taiwan and illegally detained the ship and its crew. This is an intolerable and serious violation of international law.

    The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already sent a note to the U.S. government on June 24th, demanding that the U.S. government immediately release the "Tuapse" merchant ship, its crew, and cargo, and severely punish the U.S. officials responsible for organizing this illegal action. The note pointed out that the Soviet government cannot take a disinterested attitude towards such an impermissible action and will have to take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of Soviet merchant ships navigating in the Far East. The Chinese people fully support the just stand taken by the Soviet Union on this incident and the measures it will take.

    Prior to this, the United States had instigated the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan to intercept Polish merchant ships twice, on October 4, 1952, and May 13, 1954, which have not yet been accounted for, and Poland and upright people from all over the world are continuing to investigate. However, now the United States has committed another similar crime. This blatant practice is clearly a planned act of provocation with sinister intentions.

    Everyone knows that since U.S. President Truman openly announced the armed seizure of China's territory of Taiwan on June 27, 1950, the U.S. Seventh Fleet has controlled the waters near Taiwan. Therefore, the U.S. government is absolutely unable to escape its responsibility for any violation of international law that occurs in this area. After the U.S. warships detained the Soviet merchant ship "Tuapse," a spokesman for the U.S. Far East Naval Headquarters in Yokosuka, Japan, in an attempt to evade responsibility, declared on June 25th: "The Taiwan area is under the jurisdiction of the Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet in Honolulu and is not under the jurisdiction of the Far East Navy." However, people want to ask, whether it is the "Far East Navy" or the "Pacific Fleet," aren't they both part of the U.S. Navy? Whether it is the "Naval Headquarters" in Yokosuka or the "Fleet Commander-in-Chief" in Honolulu, aren't they both commanders of the U.S. Navy? Therefore, any quibbles by the U.S. government regarding its illegal interception of merchant ships in this area will have no effect other than to arouse greater indignation among the people of all countries.

    It must be pointed out that since the United States turned Taiwan into its military base in the Far East, it has been using this military base to create tension, attempting to threaten the security of the Far East, and rudely disrupting shipping between countries around the world and the Far East, attempting to obstruct the restoration and development of normal international trade. The United States not only uses Taiwan as a military base to intercept merchant ships from countries in the peaceful and democratic camp, but also intercepts merchant ships from other countries. Since 1950, ships belonging to the United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway, Panama, Greece, and West Germany have all been subjected to piratical attacks by the U.S.-Chiang bandit gang. This, of course, seriously damages and threatens the interests of international shipping and international trade of many countries.

    Now, this aggressive behavior of the United States has reached such an unbridled point that it must arouse great attention from all countries and people who demand the safeguarding of international shipping safety and the restoration and development of international trade, and unite to condemn it, forcing the United States to immediately release the detained Soviet merchant ship and crew, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future.

### 美国海军截扣苏联商船的海盗行为

    美国海军截扣苏联商船的海盗行为
    六月二十三日，美国海军竟于台湾以南公海的海面上，对苏联商船“图阿普斯”号实行武装攻击，并把该船和船员非法扣留。这是不可容忍的违反国际法的严重事件。
    苏联外交部于六月二十四日已照会美国政府，要求美国政府必须立即放还“图阿普斯”号商船和船员及货物，并严惩负责组织这次非法行动的美国官员。照会指出，苏联政府不能够对这种不能容许的行动采取不过问的态度，并且将不得不采取适当措施以保证苏联商船在远东航行的安全。中国人民完全支持苏联对这一事件所采取的正当立场和将要采取的措施。
    在此以前，美国就曾教唆台湾蒋介石残余匪帮在一九五二年十月四日和一九五四年五月十三日两次截扣波兰商船，迄今尚未交代，波兰及世界各国正直人民正在继续追究。但是，现在美国竟又干下了同样的另一件罪行。这种蛮横做法显然是怀着阴险目的的有计划的挑衅行为。
    谁都知道，自从一九五○年六月二十七日美国总统杜鲁门公开宣布武装侵占我国领土台湾以后，美国的第七舰队就控制了台湾附近的海面。因此在这一地区所发生的任何违反国际法的事件，美国政府都是绝对逃不脱它所应负的罪责的。美国军舰扣留苏联商船“图阿普斯”号以后，美国驻日本横须贺的远东海军司令部发言人为了推卸责任，曾于六月二十五日宣称：“台湾地区属于在檀香山的太平洋舰队总司令管辖，并不属远东海军管辖。”但是，人们要问，是“远东海军”也好，是“太平洋舰队”也好，难道不都是美国的海军吗？是横须贺的“海军司令部”也好，是檀香山的“舰队总司令”也好，难道不都是美国海军的指挥者吗？因此，美国政府对于它在这一地区非法截扣商船事件的任何狡辩，除了引起各国人民的更大的愤慨以外，是不会有任何效果的。
    必须指出，美国把台湾变为它在远东的军事基地以后，就一直利用这一军事基地制造紧张局势，企图威胁远东安全，并粗暴地破坏世界各国与远东之间的航运，企图阻挠国际间正常贸易的恢复和发展。美国不仅利用台湾这个军事基地来截扣和平民主阵营国家的商船，而且也截扣其他国家的商船。从一九五○年起，属于联合王国、丹麦、挪威、巴拿马、希腊和西德的船只，就都遭到美蒋匪帮的海盗式袭击。这当然严重地损害了和威胁着许多国家的国际航运和国际贸易的利益。
    现在，美国的这种侵略行为已经达到这样无法无天的地步，它必须引起一切要求保障国际航运安全、要求恢复和发展国际贸易的国家和人民的极大注意，起来予以一致谴责，迫使美国立即放还被扣留的苏联商船及船员，并保证今后不再发生同类事件。
