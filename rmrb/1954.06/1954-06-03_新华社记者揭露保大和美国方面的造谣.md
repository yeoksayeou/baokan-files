Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 1st. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Ping) reports: The recent progress made at the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue has frightened the enemies of peace. In order to deceive public opinion, they are even blatantly spreading rumors. A statement issued by the Bao Dai delegation after the restricted meeting on the 29th is an example.

This statement said that after the "multiple" speeches by the Bao Dai representatives, the meeting on the 29th "unanimously guaranteed" that "the unity of Vietnam will be respected" when discussing the issue of gathering areas and regional adjustments for both sides' troops.

Certain Western journalists, accustomed to stirring up trouble, also made a big fuss about it. The Associated Press reporter lied even more outrageously. He said that the last clause of the communique adopted by the meeting guaranteed that Vietnam would not be "partitioned." This American reporter also said that this clause was added after the Bao Dai representative issued a "warning" to the meeting.

Of course, anyone who has read the conference communique knows that there is no such sentence in the communique at all.

The most reliable information obtained from here proves that the statement of the Bao Dai delegation is completely a rumor. At that meeting, the representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out at the beginning of his speech that there are two aspects to restoring peace in Indochina: military and political. The basic issue in the military aspect is ceasefire, and the basic issue in the political aspect is the realization of Vietnam's independence, unity, and democracy. Since the current discussion is about ceasefire, adjusting the region is absolutely necessary, but this is a preparatory stage for realizing national unity through free general elections. As for those who oppose adjusting the region, they are using national unity as a "shield" to obstruct the ceasefire and obstruct peace.

Later, the Bao Dai representative made unreasonable demands at the meeting, using "unity" as an excuse to obstruct the discussion of regional adjustment issues necessary for consolidating the ceasefire. The chairman of the meeting that day pointed out that no one opposes the unity of Vietnam, and the current discussion is about ceasefire, so this issue is not under discussion. The meeting agreed with the chairman's ruling. That's how it happened.

From this incident, people can see the extent to which those who cannot live without spreading rumors have degenerated. Obviously, the great influence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's just proposal for realizing a ceasefire in all parts of the world, including the Bao Dai-controlled area, and the new hope for peace that this proposal has aroused in people's hearts, have frightened Bao Dai and his American masters, and they are resorting to any means. However, spreading rumors does not change the facts at all. The facts prove that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is the true defender of Vietnam's peace, independence, unity, and democracy.

### 新华社记者揭露保大和美国方面的造谣

    新华社记者揭露保大和美国方面的造谣
   【新华社日内瓦一日电】本社记者李平报道：日内瓦会议在印度支那问题上近来获得的进展，把和平的敌人吓慌了。为了蒙蔽舆论，他们甚至明目张胆地造谣。保大代表团在二十九日限制性会议以后发表的一篇声明就是个例子。
    这个声明说，经过保大代表的“多次”发言之后，二十九日的会议才“一致保证”在讨论双方部队集结地区和区域调整问题时“将尊重越南的统一”。
    惯于兴风作浪的某些西方记者也跟着大做文章。美联社记者更是说谎说得没有边了。他说会议通过的公报最后一款是保证不“分治”越南。这个美国记者还说，这一款是在保大代表对会议提出 “警告”以后才加上去的。
    当然，凡是读了会议公报的人都知道公报里根本没有这句话。
    从此间获得的最可靠消息证明，保大代表团的那篇声明完全是造谣。在那次会议上，越南民主共和国代表在他的发言中一开头就指出恢复印度支那和平有军事和政治两方面。军事方面的基本问题是停火，政治方面的基本问题是实现越南的独立、统一和民主。目前既然是讨论停火，调整地区就是完全必要的，但这是用自由普选实现国家统一的准备阶段。至于那些反对调整地区的人们，他们是用国家统一当作“挡箭牌”来阻挠停火、阻挠和平。
    后来保大代表在会议上无理取闹，以“统一”为借口阻挠讨论为巩固停火所必须的区域调整问题。当天会议的主席即指出，没有人反对越南统一，现在是讨论停火，因此这个问题不在讨论之列。会议同意了主席这个裁决。事情的经过就是这样。
    从这件事，人们可以看出那些离开造谣就不能生活的人堕落到了什么地步。显然，越南民主共和国关于实现停火的公正建议在世界各地、包括保大统治区在内所产生的巨大影响，这个建议在人们心中引起的对于和平的新希望，所有这一切都把保大和他的美国主子吓慌了，他们简直不择手段了。然而造谣一点也改变不了事实，事实证明越南民主共和国才是越南和平、独立、统一、民主的真正捍卫者。
