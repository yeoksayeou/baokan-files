Films such as "Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities" to be Shown in Various Towns in Tibet

    The films "Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities" and "Brightness Illuminates Tibet," produced by the Beijing Film Studio and dubbed in Tibetan, have been transported to Lhasa and will soon be shown in various towns in Tibet. Along with these two films, generators, film projectors, and dozens of Chinese-language films have also been transported. Over the past three years, relevant departments of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have actively promoted film education in Tibet, organizing ten film projection teams in Lhasa, Shigatse, Dingqing, and other places. These teams regularly travel to rural areas and pastures to show films, conducting patriotic education for the broad masses of the Tibetan people. Recently, the Political Department of the Tibet Military Region also held a training class for film projectionists, training a group of film projectionists who will soon establish projection stations in Gyantse, Nagqu, and other areas that previously did not have film projection teams.

    “中国民族大团结”等影片将在西藏各城镇放映
    北京电影制片厂摄制的“中国民族大团结”和“光明照耀着西藏”两部配有藏语解说的影片，已运到拉萨，不久将在西藏各城镇上映。和这两部影片一起运来的还有发电机、电影放映机等电影器材，和数十部汉语影片。三年来，中国人民解放军西藏军区有关部门积极开展西藏地区的电影教育事业，先后在拉萨、日喀则、丁青等地组织了十个电影放映队，经常深入农村、牧场巡回放映，向广大藏族人民进行爱国主义教育。最近，西藏军区政治部还举办了一期电影放映人员训练班，训练了一批电影放映人员，不久将在江孜、黑河等过去没有电影放映队的地区建立放映站。（新华社）
