    U.S. Orchestrates Armed Aggression Against Guatemala
    Tan Wenrui
    The armed aggression against Guatemala, long planned by the United States, began on June 18. Armed forces composed of so-called "anti-communist exiles" invaded Guatemalan territory from Honduras by land and sea, while aircraft taking off from Honduras bombed Guatemala. The people and government of Guatemala have launched a heroic resistance to defend national sovereignty and independence, and have requested the United Nations Security Council to stop this act of aggression that undermines peace in Central America. People who love peace and justice all over the world express great indignation at the U.S.'s criminal act of organizing aggression against Guatemala.
    As everyone knows, the Guatemalan government is a democratic government determined to defend national rights. With the support and impetus of the Guatemalan people, it has adopted a series of democratic measures to protect national rights, especially the implementation of land reform, confiscating the land seized and monopolized by the American monopoly capital "United Fruit Company," so that American monopoly capital cannot continue to carry out arbitrary exploitation and enslavement in Guatemala. This measure of the Guatemalan government has won the sympathy and praise of the people of other Latin American countries, and is undoubtedly a major blow to the United States' maintenance and further implementation of colonial rule in Latin America. Therefore, for a long time, the U.S. ruling group has regarded the Guatemalan democratic government as a thorn in its side and has been determined to remove it. It is very clear that the armed aggression against Guatemala organized and instigated by the U.S. ruling group this time is an attempt to overthrow the Guatemalan democratic government, restore the colonial rule of American monopoly capital in Guatemala, and strengthen its suppression of the Latin American people's struggle for national independence.
    The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 19th, insisting that this armed aggression suffered by Guatemala was some kind of "rebellion by the Guatemalan people against the government," in an attempt to shirk its responsibility for organizing and instigating armed aggression. However, this despicable trick of the U.S. ruling group can never cover up the truth; on the contrary, it can only make its crimes more conspicuous.
    Responsible officials of the U.S. government have long made no secret of their hostility towards the Guatemalan people and the democratic government, and have been openly clamoring for intervention in Guatemala. In March of this year, the United States forced other Latin American countries to pass a so-called "anti-communism resolution" at the Tenth Inter-American Conference to create conditions for U.S. intervention in Guatemala. Later, the United States took a series of provocative actions against Guatemala, fabricating lies that "a large number of weapons were shipped from Soviet-controlled territories to Guatemala," stepping up the shipment of large quantities of munitions to Guatemala's neighboring countries, Honduras and Nicaragua, and brazenly imposing an armed blockade on Guatemala. At the same time, the United States organized subversive forces in Guatemala and its neighboring countries. The Guatemalan Embassy in the United States pointed out in a statement issued on June 3 that the Guatemalan government had uncovered a subversive organization, which was part of a conspiracy carried out abroad by Carlos Castillo Armas, an agent of the American "United Fruit Company." U.S. Secretary of State Dulles more openly hinted on June 15 that he was certain that "the vast majority of Guatemalan people want a great purge." On the third day after Dulles sent this signal, the large-scale armed offensive against Guatemala led by Carlos Castillo Armas began from Honduras.
    The U.S. ruling group could not hide its joy at this armed aggression it had organized single-handedly. United Press International in a dispatch from Washington on the 19th could not help but say: "American diplomats and congressional leaders today warmly expressed the hope that anti-communist forces would quickly overthrow the red-tinged Guatemalan government." And said that this armed attack on Guatemala "is in line with what Dulles had in mind when he expressed the hope earlier this week that the Guatemalan people would clean up their own internals." This completely exposed the U.S. ruling group's aggression plan, which was plotting this armed offensive behind the scenes.
    Not only that, while instigating armed aggression, the United States is also preparing a conspiracy to carry out direct armed intervention in Guatemala. The United States decided to convene a meeting of foreign ministers of American countries in Uruguay on July 1 in order to gather Latin American countries to take so-called "collective action" against Guatemala. The statement issued by the U.S. State Department on the 19th clearly revealed this sinister plot of the United States to "use Latin Americans to fight Latin Americans." The statement said: The armed aggression suffered by Guatemala "confirms the views previously expressed by the United States regarding the possible actions the Organization of American States" might take against Guatemala. "The State Department has been and will continue to exchange views with other countries in this hemisphere, which, in view of the situation in Guatemala, are also deeply concerned about... the actions that must be taken."
    Precisely because the United States intends to overthrow the Guatemalan democratic government by armed intervention at all costs, it has made every effort to obstruct the discussion of Guatemala's complaint to the United Nations Security Council. After the Guatemalan government filed a complaint with the United Nations Security Council on the 19th against open aggression, the U.S. representative Lodge, who was serving as chairman of the Security Council, deliberately delayed the convening of the meeting. Only because of Guatemala's insistence did the United States have to agree to convene a special meeting of the Security Council. However, at the meeting, the United States instructed Brazil and Colombia to come forward and suggest that the Guatemalan issue be submitted to the "Organization of American States," which is controlled by the United States, for discussion. This fully proves that the United States only uses the United Nations as a tool to promote its aggressive policies and cannot allow it to fulfill its responsibility to guarantee peace. This is clearly not permissible. The armed aggression instigated by the United States has not only threatened the security of Guatemala, but also threatened the peace of Latin America. As an independent sovereign state, Guatemala has every right to demand that the United Nations uphold justice and prevent aggression, and it is also the inherent duty of the Security Council to maintain international security. Therefore, under the justice of the Soviet representative, the Brazil-Colombia proposal has been rejected, and the Security Council unanimously adopted the French amendment "requiring an immediate cessation of hostilities, or actions that may lead to further bloodshed, and calling on all member states, in the spirit of the United Nations Charter, to cease providing assistance to support these activities." This time, the U.S.'s instigated armed intervention in Guatemala has once again been condemned in the court of world opinion.
    From the U.S.'s armed aggression against Guatemala, people can see more clearly the ferocious face of the U.S. neo-colonialists. In order to realize its ambition to enslave the people of other countries and establish a world colonial empire, the U.S. ruling group is not hesitating to pick up the mantle of Hitler and Japanese militarism, concocting myths of "communist threats," interfering in the internal affairs of other countries everywhere, and launching armed aggression. They are establishing many aggressive blocs everywhere as tools for launching wars of aggression. The armed intervention in Guatemala instigated by the U.S. ruling group shows that U.S. aggression policies are threatening the peace and security of all countries not only in Asia and Europe, but also on the American continent. Peace is indivisible, and it has become an urgent task for all peace forces in the world to unite more widely to stop U.S. aggression.
    At present, the armed aggression against Guatemala organized by the United States is continuing to develop. The Guatemalan democratic government has called on the people to resist the invaders. Guatemalan President Arbenz pointed out: "No Guatemalan is willing to give up freedom, willing to be deprived of the democratic system." The Guatemalan people who are fighting to defend the independence and sovereignty of their country are unyielding. The people of Latin American countries and peace-loving and justice-loving people all over the world have expressed their support for the just struggle of the Guatemalan people. The movement to support the Guatemalan people has flourished in Chile, Argentina, Mexico, and other countries in Latin America; public leaders and newspapers in many countries have condemned the U.S.'s act of aggression against Guatemala. The power of peace cannot be insulted, and the world's sympathy is on the side of the Guatemalan people.

    美国策动对危地马拉的武装侵略
    谭文瑞
    美国策划已久的对危地马拉的武装侵略，已于六月十八日开始行动了。由所谓“反共逃亡分子”组成的武装力量，自洪都拉斯海陆两路侵入危地马拉领土，同时自洪都拉斯起飞的飞机对危地马拉进行了轰炸。危地马拉人民和政府为维护国家的主权和独立已展开了英勇的抵抗，并要求联合国安理会制止这种破坏中美洲和平的侵略行为。全世界爱好和平与正义的人们对美国组织侵略危地马拉的罪恶行为表示极大的愤慨。
    人所周知，危地马拉政府是一个决心维护民族权利的民主政府。它在危地马拉人民的支持和推动下，采取了一系列保护民族权利的民主措施，特别是实行了土地改革，没收了美国垄断资本“联合果品公司”所强占和垄断的土地，使得美国垄断资本不能在危地马拉继续进行任所欲为的剥削和奴役。危地马拉政府的这种措施得到拉丁美洲其他国家人民的同情和赞扬，对美国在拉丁美洲维持和进一步推行殖民统治则无疑是一个不小的打击。因此长久以来美国统治集团就把危地马拉民主政府视作眼中钉，一心要想把它拔除。十分明显，美国统治集团这一次对危地马拉所组织和策动的武装侵略，就是企图借此推翻危地马拉民主政府，以恢复美国垄断资本在危地马拉的殖民统治，来加强它对拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立运动的镇压。
    美国国务院十九日发表声明，竟把危地马拉所遭受的这次武装侵略硬说是什么“危地马拉人对政府的造反行为”，企图借此推卸其组织和策动武装侵略的罪责。然而，美国统治集团的这种卑劣手法是绝对掩盖不了事实真相的，相反地，这只能使它的罪行欲盖弥彰。
    美国政府的负责官员早就毫不掩饰他们对危地马拉人民和民主政府的仇视，而且一直公开叫嚷着要对危地马拉进行干涉。今年三月，美国就在第十届泛美会议上强迫其他拉丁美洲国家通过了一项所谓“反对共产主义的决议”，来为美国干涉危地马拉制造条件。以后，美国对危地马拉更采取了一系列的挑衅行动，捏造什么“有大批武器从苏联控制的领土运往危地马拉”的谎言，加紧把大批军火运往危地马拉的邻国洪都拉斯和尼加拉瓜，并悍然对危地马拉实行武装封锁。同时，美国并在危地马拉国内及其邻国组织颠覆势力。危地马拉驻美大使馆于六月三日发表的声明中，即曾指出危地马拉政府已破获了一个颠覆性的组织，这个组织是由美国
  “联合果品公司”代理人卡洛斯·卡斯蒂略·阿马斯在国外进行的阴谋活动的一部分。美国国务卿杜勒斯在六月十五日更公开暗示说：他可以肯定，
  “绝大多数危地马拉人民都想来一次大清除。”就在杜勒斯发出这个信号的第三天，由卡洛斯·卡斯蒂略·阿马斯领导的对危地马拉的大规模武装进攻便从洪都拉斯开始了。
    美国统治集团对于他们所一手组织的这次武装侵略是掩饰不住他们的高兴的，美国合众社在十九日发自华盛顿的电讯中就情不自禁地说道：“美国外交家们和国会领袖们今天都热情地表示希望反共力量能很快地推翻带红色的危地马拉政府。”并且说，对危地马拉的这次武装进攻“是符合杜勒斯在本星期早些时候表示希望危地马拉人民清理自己的内部时心中所想的意思的。”这就把在幕后策划这次武装进攻的美国统治集团的侵略计划完全暴露出来了。
    不仅如此，美国在策动武装侵略的同时，还在准备对危地马拉进行直接武装干涉的阴谋。美国决定于七月一日在乌拉圭召开一次美洲国家外长会议，以便纠集拉丁美洲各国对危地马拉采取所谓“集体行动”。美国国务院十九日发表的声明，就清楚地透露出美国的这种“用拉丁美洲人打拉丁美洲人”的罪恶图谋。这个声明说：危地马拉遭受的武装侵略，“证实了美国以前就美洲国家组织”对危地马拉“可能采取的行动所表示的意见”。“国务院一直在和并将继续和这个半球的其他国家交换意见，这些国家鉴于危地马拉的局势，也对……必须采取的行动感到十分关心。”
    正是由于美国打算不顾一切地用武装干涉来颠覆危地马拉民主政府，它便竭力阻挠危地马拉向联合国安全理事会提出的控诉案的讨论。危地马拉政府十九日向联合国安全理事会对公开的侵略提出控诉后，担任安理会主席的美国代表洛奇竟故意拖延召开会议。只是由于危地马拉的坚持，美国才不得不同意召开了安理会的特别会议。但是在会议上，美国又指使巴西和哥伦比亚出面，建议把危地马拉的问题提交美国所操纵的“美洲国家组织”去讨论。这充分证明美国只把联合国作为它推行侵略政策的工具，而不能让它履行保障和平的职责。这显然是不能容许的。美国所策动的武装侵略行动，不仅已威胁到危地马拉的安全，同时也威胁到拉丁美洲的和平，作为一个独立主权国家的危地马拉完全有权利要求联合国主持公道与正义，而制止侵略维护国际安全也是安理会的天职。因此，在苏联代表的主持正义下，巴西—哥伦比亚提案已被否决，安理会一致通过了“要求立即停止敌对行为，或可能导致进一步流血的行动，并号召所有的会员国家本着联合国宪章的精神，停止予以援助来支持这些活动”的法国修正案。美国这次策动对危地马拉的武装干涉行动，又一次实际上在世界舆论的法庭面前受到了谴责。
    从美国对危地马拉的武装侵略事件中，人们可以更清楚地看到了美国新殖民主义者的凶恶面貌。美国统治集团为了实现其奴役他国人民，建立世界殖民帝国的野心，正不惜重拾起希特勒和日本军国主义的衣钵，编造出什么“共产主义威胁”的神话，到处干涉别国内政，并发动武装侵略。他们到处建立许多侵略集团，来作为发动侵略战争的工具。美国统治集团对危地马拉策动的武装干涉，说明美国的侵略政策，不仅在亚洲和欧洲，而且也在美洲大陆威胁到了各国的和平和安全。和平不可分割，世界各国的一切和平力量应更广泛地联合起来制止美国的侵略，这已成了十分迫切的任务了。
    现在，美国组织的对危地马拉的武装侵略正在继续发展中。危地马拉民主政府已号召人民对侵略者进行抵抗。危地马拉总统阿本斯指出：“没有一个危地马拉人愿意放弃自由，愿意被剥夺民主制度。”为保卫国家的独立和主权而战的危地马拉人民是不可屈服的。拉丁美洲各国人民和全世界爱好和平和正义的人士都表示支持危地马拉人民的正义斗争。声援危地马拉人民的运动已在智利、阿根廷、墨西哥和拉丁美洲的其他国家蓬勃展开；许多国家的公众领袖和报纸纷纷谴责美国对危地马拉的侵略行为。和平的力量是不可侮的，世界的同情是在危地马拉人民的一边。
