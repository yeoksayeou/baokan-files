The secondary school enrollment work is one of the key tasks of education administrative organs at all levels this year. All regions should strengthen their leadership in enrollment work based on last year's experience and this year's specific circumstances and requirements, make careful plans, make unified arrangements, and further improve publicity, education and organization. For this purpose, the following instructions are hereby given:

    I. The enrollment work of all types of secondary schools this year will still be conducted under the unified leadership of provinces and cities. Due to the large increase in the number of primary and junior high school graduates this year, except for some areas where it is still necessary to implement unified enrollment, schools in the same area can generally adopt joint enrollment or individual enrollment based on the specific situation.

    II. In order to strengthen the leadership of the secondary school enrollment work, the enrollment work in all regions should be carried out under the leadership of the local Communist Party Committee and the People's Government. At the provincial and municipal levels, secondary school enrollment committees should still be established with reference to last year's methods to be responsible for leading the enrollment work of secondary schools in the province or city. If necessary, special districts, cities, and counties under the jurisdiction of the province may also establish enrollment committees separately, which will be responsible for handling the enrollment work of secondary schools in the special district, city, and county under the unified leadership of the provincial enrollment committee.

    III. The allocation of enrollment tasks for secondary schools and normal schools in each province and city shall be specifically controlled and implemented by the provincial and municipal enrollment committees. The enrollment tasks of secondary technical schools shall be allocated to the schools by their competent business departments, and then the schools shall submit the enrollment figures to the local enrollment committee.

    IV. In order to avoid student mobility, all regions should actively persuade students to apply for schools in their own regions. The dates for the junior and senior high school entrance exams this year should in principle be from July 26th to 30th. For areas where junior high schools have students graduating early during the winter vacation, the date of the entrance exam will be uniformly determined by the provincial and municipal enrollment committees based on the specific situation if the current semester needs to be extended or other special circumstances exist. The entrance exams for secondary technical schools and normal schools can be held at the same time as the middle school exams or held earlier, as decided by the provincial and municipal enrollment committees, but all must be reported to the Greater Administrative Region Education Bureau for approval. For enrollment in normal schools, all localities should still refer to the experience of previous years and the provisions of Article 5 of the draft Interim Regulations for Normal Schools, and appropriately adopt the method of recommendation.

    V. Entrance age of students in various types of secondary schools:
    (1) The entrance age for middle school students shall be in accordance with the provisions of the draft Interim Regulations for Middle Schools: 12 full years of age for junior high school and 15 full years of age for senior high school in principle. When specifically stipulating the entrance age of students, all regions may make appropriate adjustments with reference to the actual age of the current primary and junior high school graduates in the local area.
    (2) The entrance age for normal school students shall be 15 to 30 full years of age in accordance with the draft Interim Regulations for Normal Schools. This year, junior normal schools should generally absorb in-service primary school teachers with a level below primary school graduation. In minority areas, primary school graduates can be recruited.
    (3) The entrance age for students in secondary technical schools is 15 to 25 full years of age. The entrance age for worker-peasant cadres (including worker-peasant cadres transferred from the army), industrial workers, children of ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese can be relaxed, but the maximum shall not exceed 30 full years of age.

    VI. The examination subjects for various types of secondary schools, except for middle schools and normal schools, which will not be uniformly stipulated this year and will still be decided by the provincial and municipal enrollment committees themselves, the examination subjects for secondary technical schools are as follows: Common Knowledge of the Chinese Revolution, Chinese Language, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. However, those applying for schools of architecture, art, fine arts, sports, music, and drama should add examination items according to their professional nature.

    VII. Strengthening ideological education for current primary and junior high school graduates is an important link in doing a good job in enrollment. Under the leadership of the local Communist Party Committee, all regions should not only do a good job in publicity and education for all sectors of society, but also, for students in schools, school leaders, class teachers, and teachers should, together with the Communist Youth League of China, the Young Pioneers of China and other organizations, deeply understand the ideological characteristics of students in different periods before and after the exam, and give students positive and positive education through specific examples. For the ideas of belittling physical labor, unwillingness to engage in industrial and agricultural production, and unwillingness to apply for normal, forestry, finance and economics, health and other professional schools, we must grasp the principles of enlightenment, guidance, and persuasive education, and carry out in-depth and meticulous ideological education. In the process of organizing students to engage in industrial and agricultural production, we should still help students solve ideological and work problems.

    VIII. When determining the admission of students in various regions, in addition to giving consideration to the children of martyrs' families, other care targets can be determined according to the specific conditions of the local area. In areas where unified enrollment is implemented, students who have been admitted after the examination should be assigned to schools on the basis of their own free will. If it is necessary to change the students' original wishes, they must be patiently persuaded and educated, and must not be forced.

    IX. For students who apply for the exam with equivalent academic qualifications, they should be required to meet the enrollment conditions stipulated by the secondary school (including entrance age, educational level, and health status), and must hold a certificate from the government or agency above the district level (in large and medium-sized cities, the police station can issue a certificate, the content of the certificate should mainly be: political situation, what work has been done, whether they are students, etc.) and relevant reference documents on educational level. If they have attended primary or junior high school, they must hold a certificate of study from the original school before they can apply for the exam, in order to prevent students from skipping grades and making reckless advances. Cadres on the job must hold a permit from the original service agency to apply for the exam.

    X. When this year's junior high school graduates apply for senior high schools, they should, as far as possible in areas where conditions permit, hold a physical examination certificate or health card from the original school certified by the hospital. If the certificate or card does not exceed one year, it should be considered valid. All schools with junior high school graduation classes should, as far as possible, conduct a health check for students before graduation. For candidates with equivalent academic qualifications, they should also be asked to go to the designated hospital for examination.

    XI. If some schools need to enroll students from other places, if they are enrolling students across provinces, they must contact the local provincial enrollment committee in advance; if they are enrolling students across regions, they must first obtain the consent of the local Greater Administrative Region Education Bureau.

    XII. In order to do a good job in this year's enrollment work, the provincial and municipal enrollment committees should focus on controlling one or two regions within the province and city in order to learn from experience and guide other regions; the Greater Administrative Region Education Bureau should also focus on inspecting the enrollment work of provinces and cities, exchange experiences, and assist in solving various problems related to enrollment work.

    XIII. The education departments and bureaus of each province and city should, before the end of October, summarize the organization and leadership, implementation methods, main experiences, existing problems and improvement suggestions of this year's secondary school enrollment work, and report them to the Greater Administrative Region Education Bureau and the Central Ministry of Education and the Central Ministry of Higher Education.

    中央教育部、高等教育部
    关于一九五四年全国中等学校招生工作的指示
    做好中等学校的招生工作，是今年各级教育行政机关的重点工作之一。各地区应根据去年的经验及今年的具体情况与要求，加强对招生工作的领导，缜密筹划，统一部署，进一步做好宣传教育与组织工作。为此，特作如下指示：
    一、本年各类中等学校的招生工作，仍以省、市为单位统一领导进行。招生办法，由于今年高小及初中毕业生大量增加，除某些地区仍有必要实行统一招生外，一般可根据具体情况，采取同一地区的学校联合招生或由各校单独进行招生。
    二、为了加强对于中等学校招生工作的领导，各地区招生工作均应在当地中共党委及人民政府领导下进行。省、市一级，仍参照去年办法，建立中等学校招生委员会，负责领导各该省、市内中等学校的招生工作。省属专区、市、县如需要时亦可分别建立招生委员会，在省招生委员会统一领导下，负责办理各该专区、市、县内中等学校的招生工作。
    三、各省、市中学及师范学校招生任务的分配，由省、市招生委员会具体掌握执行。中等技术学校招生任务由其主管业务部门分配至学校，再由学校向当地招生委员会提出招生数字。
    四、为避免学生流动，各地区应积极说服学生在本地区投考学校。初、高级中学招生考试日期，本年以在七月二十六日至三十日为原则。各地区初中有寒假提前毕业学生，本学期须延期结束或有其他特殊情况者，招生考试日期由省、市招生委员会根据具体情况统一规定。中等技术学校、师范学校招生考试可与中学同时举行或先期举行，由省、市招生委员会决定，但均须报经大区教育局批准。师范学校招生，各地仍得参照历年经验，及师范学校暂行规程草案第五条之规定，适当采用保送办法。
    五、各类中等学校学生入学年龄：
    （一）中学学生入学年龄依照中学暂行规程草案规定：初级中学以十二足岁，高级中学以十五足岁为原则。各地区在具体规定学生入学年龄时，可参照当地本届高小及初中毕业生的实际年龄，酌予伸缩。
    （二）师范学校学生的入学年龄依照师范学校暂行规程草案规定为十五足岁至三十足岁。今年初级师范学校招生，一般应吸收具有高小毕业以下程度的在职小学教师，少数民族地区可招收高小毕业生。
      （三）中等技术学校学生的入学年龄为十五足岁至二十五足岁。对于工农干部（包括部队转业工农干部）、产业工人、少数民族与华侨子女入学年龄尚可放宽，但最高不得超过三十足岁。
    六、各类中等学校考试科目，除中学、师范本年暂不作统一规定，仍由各省、市招生委员会自行决定外，中等技术学校考试科目如下：中国革命常识、语文、数学、理化。但投考建筑艺术、美术、体育、音乐、戏剧等学校者，应按其专业性质增加考试项目。
    七、加强高小及初中应届毕业生的思想教育，是做好招生工作的重要环节。各地区在当地中共党委领导下，除向社会各阶层认真做好宣传教育工作外，对于在校学生，各校领导干部、班主任和教师应会同中国新民主主义青年团、中国少年先锋队等组织，深入了解学生在考试前后各个不同时期的思想特点，通过具体事例，给学生以积极的正面的教育。对于轻视体力劳动，不愿从事工农业生产及不愿投考师范、农林、财经、卫生等专业学校的思想，必须掌握启发、诱导、说服教育的原则，进行深入细致的思想教育。在组织学生从事工农业生产的过程中，仍应帮助学生解决思想上及工作上的问题。
    八、各地区在确定录取学生时，除对于烈士家属子女应予以照顾外，其余照顾对象可根据当地具体情况决定之。在实行统一招生的地区，对于经过考试已被录取的学生，应在他们自愿的基础上分配学校，如必须变更学生原来志愿时，对于有意见的学生，须耐心地予以说服教育，不能强迫。
    九、对于以同等学力来报考的学生，应要求符合于中等学校规定的入学条件（包括入学年龄、文化程度及健康状况等），并须持有当地区级以上政府或机关的证明文件（大、中城市可由派出所出具证明、证明内容主要应是：政治情况、做过什么工作、是否是在校学生等）及有关文化程度的参考证件。如系进过小学或初中，必须持有原肄业学校的修业证明文件，始能报考，以防止在校学生躐等冒进。在职干部报考学校须持有原服务机关的许可证件。
    十、本届初中毕业生报考高级中等学校时，在有条件的地区，应尽可能持有医院证明的体格检查证或原校健康卡片。是项证明或卡片如不超过一年，均应认为有效。凡有初中毕业班的学校，在学生毕业前，应尽可能给他们进行一次健康检查。对于同等学力的考生，亦应令其到指定的医院去检查。
    十一、部分学校需要到外地招生时，如系跨省招生者，必须事先与当地省级招生委员会取得联系；如系跨区招生者，必须事先征得当地大区教育局的同意。
    十二、为了做好今年的招生工作，各省、市招生委员会应在省、市范围内，重点掌握一两个地区，以便吸取经验，指导其他地区；各大区教育局亦应有重点检查省、市招生工作，交流经验，并协助解决有关招生工作中的各项问题。
    十三、各省、市教育厅、局对于本年中等学校招生工作，应于十月底以前就招生工作的组织领导、进行办法、主要经验、存在问题及改进建议等作成总结，分别报告大区教育局及中央教育部、中央高等教育部。　八月四日
