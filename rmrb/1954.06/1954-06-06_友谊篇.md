    Friendship
    Kim Buk-won, Member of the Korean People's Delegation to China
    At the Station
    The moment I stepped off the surging, excited train,
    I was immediately surrounded by bouquets of flowers,
    The moment we met, we felt like brothers and comrades.
    How could a tight handshake
    Fully express the words in our hearts,
    Tell of the friendship deepened during the war!
    The passion of embrace boiled in our chests,
    The little girl running with flowers, then lifted up,
    The butterflies on her pigtails were redder than her rosy cheeks.
    You asked, "Are the children of Korea well?"
    "Yes, they are all studying hard."
    Ah, talking to these pure faces,
    We were unknowingly surrounded by dancing crowds.
    The little girl twirling with two braids swinging over her shoulders,
    Let us sing together,
    "People of the world, one heart..."
    The heart of Korea,
    The heart of China,
    We are of one heart,
    We defended each other's homeland,
    Defended the East...
    ………………
    "Marshal Kim Il-sung is well...
    Chairman Mao Zedong is well...
    Korean uncles are well...
    Young Pioneers are well..."
    Let us sing together, Red Scarves,
    Children on the mainland, caressed by the spring breeze,
    We mutually respect our wise leaders,
    We are so free and happy!
    At this moment, we are again on the shoulders of the children,
    Suddenly lifted up, forgetting the time,
    The people filling the station,
    Also seem to twist into a ball, spinning...

    Discussing the friendship between the two countries amidst the applause of four thousand five hundred people
    Because we were honored guests, the moment we got off the train,
    They—four thousand five hundred people—welcomed us with applause;
    This is a new auditorium, the people of the Southwest Region
    Decorated it with colorful greens and flowers with warm hospitality.
    They understand our heartfelt intentions in coming here across mountains and rivers,
    We are with them,
    Humbly and sincerely discussing the friendship between the two countries.
    A friendship forged with blood for a long time;
    On the road to fighting for the independence of our homelands,
    On the road to defending our homelands,
    Our friendship, holding high the banner of peace.
    Our friendship is unbreakable,
    Even raising a flag with such words written on it
    Cannot fully express our feelings,
    These feelings overflow in each other's hearts, let them become words.
    —During the most difficult times for the Korean people,
    You helped us with your blood.
    —The Korean people and heroes repelled the invaders,
    We are carrying out peaceful construction.
    —We have defended the peace of the free East,
    No one in the world will ever be able to
    Destroy our friendship,
    Be able to destroy our strength in defending peace.
    We are talking to each other,
    How could we possibly talk enough in this one night
    About the deep friendship our leaders have forged for us!
    Yes, let us shout together,
    Our beloved leaders Kim Il-sung and Mao Zedong,
    Shout their glorious names,
    Let four thousand five hundred voices become one voice,
    Shout our dearest names higher, even higher!
                (Translated by Li Qilie, Jia Zhi)

    友谊篇
    朝鲜人民访华代表团团员　金北原
    在车站上
    一走下波涛汹涌般激动的车站，
    我立刻被围在各种花束里，
    我们一见面，  就感到是兄弟和战友。
    紧紧地握手，怎么能够
    把我们心里的话全都吐露，
    说出我们在战争里加深了的友谊！
    拥抱的热情在胸中沸腾，
    抱着鲜花奔来又被抱起的小姑娘啊，
    她的发髻上的蝴蝶比那红脸蛋还更红。
    你们问：“朝鲜的少年儿童好吗？”
    “好哇，他们都在好好学习。”
    啊，对着这些纯洁的面孔谈着话，
    我们不觉已被跳舞的人群围起。
    肩上摆动着两条辫子旋转的小姑娘啊，
    我们一块歌唱吧，
    “全世界人民心一条……”
    朝鲜的心，
    中国的心，
    我们是一条心，
    我们保卫了彼此的祖国，
    保卫了东方……
    ………………
    “金日成元帅好呀……
    毛泽东主席好呀……
    朝鲜的叔叔们好呀……
    少年先锋队好呀……”
    我们一块儿歌唱红领巾吧，
    春风吹拂的大陆上的小朋友们啊，
    我们互相敬爱着英明的领袖，
    我们是这样的自由而幸福啊！
    我们此刻又在小朋友们的肩膀上，
    猛然被抬起来，忘记了时间，
    拥满车站的人们，
    也好像扭成一团在旋转……
    在四千五百人的鼓掌声中谈着两个国家的友谊
    因为是贵宾来了，我们一走下车厢，
    他们——四千五百个人就用鼓掌来欢迎；
    这儿是一座新礼堂，西南区人民
    用款待的热情把它装饰得彩绿花红。
    他们明白我们千山万水来到这儿的心意，
    我们同他们在一起，
    谦逊而真诚地倾谈着两个国家的友谊。
    长久以鲜血凝成的友谊；
    在争取你我祖国独立的路上，
    在保卫你我祖国的路上，
    我们高举起和平旗帜的友谊。
    我们的友谊是牢不可破的，
    把写着这样字句的旗帜高高举起
    也表达不尽我们的心情，
    这心情在彼此的胸中洋溢，就让它变成言语。
    ——在朝鲜人民最艰苦的时期，
    你们用心血帮助了我们。
    ——朝鲜人民和英雄们击退了侵略者，
    我们正进行着和平建设。
    ——我们保卫了自由东方的和平，
    世界上再不会有人
    能够把我们的友谊破坏，
    能够把我们这保卫和平的力量摧毁。
    我们彼此谈着心啊，
    在这一个晚上，怎么能够谈尽
    我们领袖为我们结成的深深的友谊！
    是的，一起高喊吧，
    我们敬爱的领袖金日成、毛泽东，
    高喊他们的光辉的名字吧，
    让四千五百个声音变成一个声音，
    把我们最亲爱的名字喊得高些，再高些吧！
                （李启烈、贾芝译）
