    Recently, fishermen in Beihai City, Guangxi Province, captured a dugong in Tokyo Bay. The dugong is nine feet long and weighs 832 pounds. Dugong skin can be made into leather, the meat is edible and very delicious, and the liver and fat can be made into industrial oil. The dugong has been purchased by the Guangxi Provincial Aquatic Products Company. The dugong's skin will be peeled off to make a specimen, and the bones will be sent to the Chinese Academy of Sciences for research on marine animals.
    The dugong is a viviparous mammal, gray-black in color, and likes to eat seaweed. This time, it followed the tide to the shallow sea to find seaweed, and was captured by fishermen after the tide receded. (Ai Qiu)

    广西省北海市捕获大海牛
    广西省北海市渔民最近在东京湾内捕获大海牛一条。海牛身长九尺，重八百三十二斤。海牛皮可以制革，肉可供食用，味很鲜美，肝和肥肉可制工业用油。这条海牛已由广西省水产公司收购，海牛的皮将剥下做标本，骨骼送给中国科学院作研究海上动物之用。
    海牛是一种胎生的哺乳动物，颜色灰黑，喜吃海草。这次是随海潮到浅海找海草吃，水退后，被渔民捕获。（艾秋）
