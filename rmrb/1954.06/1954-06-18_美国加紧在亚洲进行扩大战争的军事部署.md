Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: While the United States authorities are doing their utmost to obstruct the progress of the Geneva Conference, they are stepping up their conspiracies in Asia to expand puppet armies and organize aggressive blocs, in preparation for the United States to launch new military adventures.

    Former commander of the US Eighth Army in the Korean War, Van Fleet, arrived in Tokyo, Japan again on the 11th after holding a series of meetings with US military and political leaders in Washington. According to the Associated Press, Van Fleet will visit South Korea and Taiwan again after his activities in Tokyo. He will continue his aggressive activities in the Far East for thirty to sixty days. Van Fleet was ordered by US President Eisenhower at the end of April to make military deployments in the Far East. He shuttled between Tokyo, Seoul, and Taiwan, holding secret talks with Yoshida, Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek, as well as US military leaders in the Far East, and inspecting and investigating the training and equipment of puppet troops. According to Western news agencies, Van Fleet's mission to the Far East is to expand and strengthen puppet armies and to organize a Northeast Asian military aggression bloc including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands, which will serve as the "northern pillar" of the Southeast Asian military aggression bloc that the United States is organizing. On the eve of the Five-Nation Military Conference of the United States, Britain, France, Australia, and New Zealand in early June, Van Fleet was ordered to rush back to Washington to report to the US authorities on the results of his activities in the Far East.

    During his time in Washington, Van Fleet held secret talks with US President Eisenhower and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford. According to US newspapers, Van Fleet suggested to Eisenhower during the talks that the United States should step up preparations to expand the Indochina War. Van Fleet also reported on the US military deployment in the Far East at secret meetings of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Armed Services Committee. According to US newspapers, Van Fleet suggested expanding and training Asian puppet armies and using them as cannon fodder for the United States to launch new aggressions in Asia. Obviously, Van Fleet's mission to the Far East again this time is to step up the expansion of cannon fodder and pave the way for US military adventures.

    Chase, the head of the US military aid advisory group in Taiwan, also arrived in Taiwan on the 10th via Manila after reporting on the situation of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army to the US authorities in Washington. According to the International News Service, Chase will double the number of personnel in his advisory group after returning to Taiwan in order to strengthen control and training of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet army. While passing through Manila, Chase also held two days of secret talks with US military leaders in the Philippines on issues between Taiwan and the Philippines. At the same time, US Assistant Secretary of the Air Force Douglas, accompanied by US Far East Air Force Commander Partridge, flew from Tokyo to South Korea on the 2nd to inspect US Air Force units and air bases in South Korea. US Far East Army Deputy Commander Hickey also flew from Tokyo to Okinawa on the 7th to observe a large-scale amphibious landing exercise conducted by the US military there since the 4th. According to Agence France-Presse, the exercise is part of a provocative military exercise conducted by the United States in the Pacific region. The exercise will last for two weeks and involve 21 US Navy ships and a large number of Army and Marine Corps personnel.

    Under the orders of the US authorities, puppets such as Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, and Bao Dai are also busy carrying out activities, preparing to sell their lives for the United States to launch new adventures in Asia. Syngman Rhee has invited the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, "Bao Dai Vietnam," Thailand, the Philippines, etc. to hold a meeting in South Korea on June 15. According to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang news agency, Syngman Rhee is preparing to establish a military aggression group of these puppets through this meeting in order to serve the US policy of expanding the Asian war of aggression and establishing an Asian colonial empire.

    At the same time, military and political leaders in Washington are also stepping up their aggressive activities to organize the Southeast Asian military aggression bloc and expand the Indochina War. On the one hand, they are trying their best to tie the hands and feet of their allies through the ongoing Five-Nation Military Conference; on the other hand, they are stepping up talks with their servants in Southeast Asia to conduct military deployments. Radford and Dulles held talks with Romulo, the special envoy of Philippine President Magsaysay, on the 4th and 5th respectively, to discuss the establishment of a US-Philippines military committee and accelerate the expansion of the Philippine puppet army. Philippine Army Chief of Staff Vargas was ordered by the United States on the 10th to rush to Washington for military talks. Dulles also held talks with Thai Ambassador to the United States Sarasin on the 5th, deciding that Thailand should send a military delegation to Washington to discuss the expansion of the Thai army. The US Department of Defense urgently issued an order on the 10th, requiring Thailand to send senior military officers to Washington for talks as soon as possible. According to Western news agencies, one of the reasons why the United States is impatiently asking the Philippines and Thailand to send senior military officers to Washington is to try to bring these two countries into the ongoing Five-Nation Military Conference in order to negotiate the establishment of the Southeast Asian military bloc according to the US plan.

    All these facts clearly show that the US authorities sent their representatives to Geneva not in good faith to peacefully resolve the urgent problems in Asia through negotiations, but to try every means to delay and disrupt the Geneva Conference so that the United States could gain time to make military preparations for expanding the Asian war of aggression.

### 美国加紧在亚洲进行扩大战争的军事部署

    美国加紧在亚洲进行扩大战争的军事部署
    【新华社十二日讯】美国当局在竭力阻挠日内瓦会议进展的同时，正在亚洲加紧进行扩充傀儡军队、组织侵略集团等阴谋活动，为美国发动新的军事冒险进行准备。
    前侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特在华盛顿和美国军政首脑举行一系列会议以后，已在十一日再度从美国到达日本东京。据合众社报道，范佛里特在东京进行活动以后，将再次到南朝鲜和台湾去。他将在远东继续进行三十天到六十天的侵略活动。范佛里特是在四月底奉美国总统艾森豪威尔的命令到远东来进行军事部署的。他在东京、汉城、台湾之间来来去去，与吉田、李承晚和蒋介石以及远东美军首脑举行秘密会谈，视察和调查傀儡军队的训练和武器装备的情况。据西方通讯社透露，范佛里特到远东来的任务是扩充和加强傀儡军队，并组织一个包括日本、南朝鲜、台湾、琉球群岛等在内的东北亚军事侵略集团，这个侵略集团将作为美国正在组织中的东南亚军事侵略集团的“北部支柱”。在美、英、法、澳、新五国军事会议六月初召开的前夕，范佛里特又奉命匆匆忙忙赶回华盛顿，向美国当局报告他在远东进行活动的结果。
    范佛里特在华盛顿期间，曾与美国总统艾森豪威尔和参谋长联席会议主席雷德福举行了秘密会谈。据美国报纸透露，范佛里特在会谈中向艾森豪威尔建议，美国应该加紧准备扩大印度支那战争。范佛里特还在参议院外交委员会和军事委员会的秘密会议上，作了美国在远东的军事部署的报告。据美国报纸透露，范佛里特建议扩充和训练亚洲的傀儡军队，利用他们来为美国在亚洲发动新的侵略充当炮灰。很显然，范佛里特这次奉命再度到远东来进行活动，就是为了加紧扩充炮灰，为美国的军事
      冒险铺平道路。
    美国驻台湾的军事援助顾问团团长蔡斯在华盛顿向美国当局报告蒋匪军的情况以后，也在十日从美国经马尼拉到达台湾。据国际新闻社透露，蔡斯回到台湾后将把他的顾问团的人员扩充一倍，以便加强控制和训练蒋介石傀儡军队。蔡斯经过马尼拉时，还和美国驻菲律宾的军事首脑就台湾、菲律宾之间的问题进行了两天秘密会谈。同时，美国空军部副部长道格拉斯在美国远东空军司令帕特里奇的陪同下，在二日从东京飞往南朝鲜，视察美国在南朝鲜的空军部队和空军基地。美国远东陆军副司令希凯也在七日从东京飞往冲绳岛，参观美军从四日起在那里举行的大规模两栖登陆作战演习。据法新社报道，这次演习是美国在太平洋地区举行的挑衅性军事演习的一部分，这次演习将进行两周，参加的有美国海军舰只二十一艘和大批陆军和海军陆战队。
    在美国当局的命令下，李承晚、蒋介石和保大之流的傀儡也正在忙忙碌碌地进行活动，准备为美国在亚洲发动新的冒险卖命。李承晚已经邀请蒋介石匪帮、“保大越南”、泰国、菲律宾等在六月十五日在南朝鲜举行会议。据蒋匪帮通讯社透露，李承晚准备通过这次会议成立一个这些傀儡的军事侵略集团，以便为美国扩大亚洲侵略战争、建立亚洲殖民帝国的政策服务。
    与此同时，华盛顿的军政首脑也正在加紧进行组织东南亚军事侵略集团和扩大印度支那战争的侵略活动。他们一方面竭力设法通过正在举行的五国军事会议来束缚住他们的盟国的手脚；另一方面加紧和他们在东南亚的仆从国家举行会谈，进行军事部署。雷德福、杜勒斯先后在四日和五日和菲律宾总统麦格赛赛的特使罗慕洛会谈，讨论了成立美菲军事委员会，加速扩充菲律宾傀儡军队的问题。菲律宾陆军参谋长瓦加斯已在十日奉美国命令急急忙忙赶到华盛顿去举行军事会谈。杜勒斯在五日还和泰国驻美国大使沙拉信进行会谈，决定由泰国派遣一个军事代表团到华盛顿去讨论扩充泰国军队的问题。美国国防部在十日又火急地发出了命令，要泰国赶快派遣高级军官到华盛顿去举行会谈。据西方通讯社透露，美国迫不及待地要菲律宾和泰国派遣高级军官到华盛顿去的一个目的是，企图把这两个国家拉进正在举行的五国军事会议中去，以便按照美国的计划，谈判成立东南亚军事集团的问题。
    所有这些事实十分清楚地说明，美国当局派遣它的代表到日内瓦去，不是真心诚意要通过谈判和平解决亚洲的迫切问题，而是千方百计要拖延和破坏日内瓦会议，以便美国取得时间来进行扩大亚洲侵略战争的军事准备。
