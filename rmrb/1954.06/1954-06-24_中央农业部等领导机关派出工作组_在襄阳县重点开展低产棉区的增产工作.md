Leadership Organs such as the Central Ministry of Agriculture Send Work Groups to Focus on Increasing Production in Low-Yield Cotton Areas of Xiangyang County

In the Southern cotton regions – Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, etc. – coarse cotton accounts for about 50 to 70 percent of the cotton acreage. However, due to insufficient attention in the past, the yield of coarse cotton in many areas is very low, generally only producing 15 or 16 jin of ginned cotton per mu. In order to increase the yield per unit area in these cotton regions and strive for an overall bumper harvest of cotton, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and agricultural research institutions and leading organs in Central-South, Hubei, and other regions have sent work groups to focus on this work, with Xiangyang, Hubei, as the key area.

More than 70 percent of Xiangyang County's 700,000 mu of cotton fields are planted after wheat, and most of them are located on barren hills with large land area, small population, poor soil quality, and extensive cultivation. With the help of the work groups, Xiangyang County has identified key technical measures to increase production and has proposed a production increase plan for this year's cotton fields to increase the unit area yield by more than 20 percent compared to the normal yield.

At present, most cotton seedlings in Xiangyang County are developing better than in previous years. In the future, they also plan to continue strengthening field management to ensure the completion of this year's production increase task. (Ren)

    中央农业部等领导机关派出工作组
    在襄阳县重点开展低产棉区的增产工作
    南方棉区——湖北、湖南、江苏、安徽、浙江等地，粗绒棉约占棉田面积百分之五十到七十。但由于过去重视不够，很多地区粗绒棉产量很低，每亩一般只产皮棉十五、六斤。中央人民政府农业部和中南、湖北等农业研究机关、领导机关为了提高这些棉区的单位面积产量，争取棉花全面丰产，都派出工作组以湖北襄阳为重点开展这一工作。
    襄阳县七十多万亩棉田中有百分之七十以上是麦茬花，而且大部分布在地多人少、土质瘠薄、耕作粗放的岗地上。在工作组帮助下，襄阳县已找出关键性的增产技术措施，提出了今年的棉田单位面积产量要比常年产量提高二成多的增产计划。
    目前襄阳县大部棉苗都比往年发育得好，今后还准备继续加强田间管理工作，保证完成今年增产任务。（仁）
