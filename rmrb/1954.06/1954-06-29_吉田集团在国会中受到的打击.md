    The Yoshida Group Suffers Setbacks in the Diet
    Lan Hai

    Under the instigation of the United States, the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan is stepping up its rearmament and implementing fascism. During the 19th Diet session, which ran from January to the June closing of the Diet this year, the Yoshida Group forced the Diet to pass a total of 176 bills. These included the U.S.-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" and three other related agreements, the 1954 budget案 (rejected by the House of Councillors) which forces the people to tighten their belts for rearmament, the "Self-Defense Forces Law" and the "Defense Agency Establishment Law" to expand the U.S. mercenary forces and establish a disguised military department, the "National Defense Secrets Protection Law" which stifles freedom of speech and publication, and two education laws that deprive school teachers and staff of their political rights. This series of reactionary bills is intended to allow the Yoshida government to carry out its policy of reviving militarism and serving as a tool of U.S. aggression.

    However, the powerful struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S. and the Yoshida Group's rearmament of Japan has deepened and expanded the contradictions between the opposition parties and the ruling group. Although the Yoshida Liberal Party, due to its collusion with war criminal Mamoru Shigemitsu's Progressive Party, controlled more than three-fifths of the votes in the House of Representatives and two-fifths of the votes in the House of Councillors, it still encountered heavy setbacks when it forced the Diet to pass reactionary bills. Major corruption cases within the Yoshida Group were exposed one after another in the Diet; many important reactionary bills failed to pass quickly. The Yoshida Group repeatedly forced extensions of the Diet session and even staged all-out brawls in the Diet, beating opposition party members who opposed extending the Diet session. As a result, the reactionary Yoshida government became even more discredited and teetered on the brink of collapse.

    Not long after the Diet session opened, one major corruption case after another was exposed, dealing the Yoshida Group a head-on blow. The "Economic Preservation Association" bribery case and the shipbuilding loan fraud case, among other major corruption cases, all implicated prominent figures in the Yoshida Group. On February 19, opposition party members announced in the Diet that the records of merchant Mitsumasa Moriwaki stated that between May of last year and January of this year, Liberal Party Secretary-General Eisaku Sato, Policy Research Council Chairman Hayato Ikeda, Yoshida Cabinet Foreign Minister Katsuo Okazaki, Justice Minister Takeo Inukai, Minister of State Banboku Ono, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Mori Mutsu, Cabinet Secretary-General Kenji Fukunaga, and the president of the national bank, the Bank of Japan, Naoto Ichimada, had accepted more than 50 lavish geisha banquets from shipbuilding merchants alone. The corruption and scandals of senior officials and Diet members of the Yoshida Group reached such a degree that they accepted huge bribes to formulate laws and sell out national interests to large capitalists. For example, after senior figures in the Yoshida Group accepted bribes from shipbuilding merchants, they manipulated the Diet last year to pass the "Interest Subsidy and Loss Compensation Law for Construction Loans for Ocean-Going Vessels," using the people's taxes to allow shipbuilding companies dominated by the Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and other zaibatsu to obtain huge profits of more than 25 billion yen. Because the profits from accepting "planned shipbuilding" orders were huge, shipping companies did their best to bribe senior government officials and Diet members to obtain allocated shipbuilding orders, with the going rate for bribes as high as 10 million yen (approximately US$30,000) per ship.

    After these major corruption cases were continuously exposed, national public opinion was in uproar, and the masses were indignant. The Yoshida Group exhausted all means, even resorting to interference from the American occupiers, to try to cover up the corruption cases. When it later became impossible to cover up, and the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office decided to arrest Liberal Party Secretary-General Eisaku Sato on April 20 for accepting bribes from shipbuilding companies, the Yoshida Group became enraged and used its power to prevent the arrest. This blatant act of shielding corruption aroused even more unstoppable anger among the Japanese people and public opinion. On April 22, opposition party members proposed a motion of no confidence in the Yoshida Cabinet, almost causing the Yoshida Cabinet to fall. Although the Yoshida Group rejected the motion of no confidence by a narrow majority, even the bourgeois newspaper "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" commented: "The Yoshida regime maintained its power with a majority of votes, but the people do not support these votes." "Yomiuri Shimbun" also admitted: "The government's actions are nothing more than an ugly struggle to cling to power shamelessly."

    Many of the Yoshida Group's reactionary bills were delayed in the Diet due to attacks by opposition party members. The 1954 "austerity" budget案, which the Yoshida Group manipulated the House of Representatives to pass on March 4, had still not been passed by the House of Councillors. By May 8, the statutory closing date of the Diet session, reactionary bills such as the "Self-Defense Forces Law," the "Defense Agency Establishment Law," the "National Defense Secrets Protection Law," the new Police Law, and the two education laws had not been passed by the House of Councillors. Therefore, the Yoshida Group disregarded the opposition of opposition party members and repeatedly forced the Diet to extend the session.

    June 3 was the last day of the third extension of the Diet session, which was forced by the Yoshida Group. Yoshida was convinced that the Diet would be able to pass all the reactionary bills and close, so he decided to go to Washington on June 4 to "meet" with Eisenhower and Dulles, taking the series of reactionary bills passed by the Diet as a "gift" to exchange for greater "assistance" from his master. At the same time, he also planned to make a "world tour" from Washington to London, Paris, West Germany, Italy, and Thailand. However, on the evening of the 3rd, the new Police Law could not be passed by the Diet, and the Yoshida Group again requested the Diet to extend the session for a fourth time. Communist Party, Labor-Farmer Party, Left-wing Socialist Party, and Right-wing Socialist Party members in the House of Representatives expressed their firm opposition. A full-scale brawl broke out in the Diet. When the Left-wing and Right-wing Socialist Parties tried to prevent the forced extension of the session, the Yoshida's Liberal Party members started to beat them, and mobilized 200 police officers to surround the Diet and join in the beating, injuring many members. It was not until late at night that the Speaker of the House of Representatives illegally unilaterally announced the fourth extension of the Diet session for two days near the entrance of the venue. On the 4th, the Left-wing and Right-wing Socialist Parties issued a joint statement, pointing out that the 19th Diet session had already closed on June 3, and demanded the resignation of the entire Yoshida Cabinet. The Socialist Party's struggle was supported by the Communist Party and the Labor-Farmer Party. Although the Yoshida Group later forcibly announced a fifth extension of the Diet session for ten days and illegally "passed" the new Police Law in the House of Councillors, members of the Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, the Left-wing and Right-wing Socialist Parties, and some members of the Conservative Party have refused to attend the Diet since the 4th.

    This atrocity by the Yoshida Group once again aroused accusations from the Japanese people and public opinion. "Akahata," the central organ of the Japanese Communist Party, published an editorial supporting the Socialist Party's struggle in the Diet. On June 19, a mass rally of 20,000 people was held in Tokyo to protest the Yoshida Group's atrocities and demand the resignation of the Yoshida Cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet. On June 20, the National Congress of the Japan Federation of Newspaper Workers also demanded the immediate resignation of the Yoshida government and the holding of new general elections.

    The occurrence of this unprecedented atrocity by the Yoshida Group is not accidental. The reactionary, traitorous, and corrupt Yoshida Group has had to rely on violence to maintain its reactionary rule. Even the Associated Press admitted: "Yoshida, with thirty bodyguards, is daily labelled as 'shameless dictator' – or even worse."

    Yoshida Shigeru, who was originally preparing to go to the United States in a swaggering manner, had to announce an indefinite postponement of his "trip abroad" in a dejected manner after being repeatedly attacked by opposition party members in the Diet. The U.S.-Japan military talks arranged by Washington could not be held as scheduled. The U.S. ruling group was extremely annoyed by this. A Kyodo News Agency dispatch from New York reported that the United States was "deeply worried" about the embarrassment of its "ally," Japan. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Allison openly stated in a statement to reporters: "The United States is very disappointed."

    The setbacks suffered by the Yoshida Group in the Diet reflect the struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S. policy of rearming Japan and enslaving the Japanese people, and against the Yoshida reactionary government's acts of treason. The Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued an appeal on the 11th to 200 democratic groups, including the Labor-Farmer Party, the Left-wing and Right-wing Socialist Parties, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, calling on the Socialist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, and the Communist Party to join hands closely, and for all democratic groups to stand at the forefront of the people's struggle, to jointly launch a nationwide anti-fascist struggle to overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet.

    吉田集团在国会中受到的打击
    蓝海
    在美国的驱使下，日本吉田反动政府正在加紧重新武装，实行法西斯化。今年一月起至六月闭幕的日本第十九届国会开会期间，吉田集团一共强制国会通过了一百七十六项法案，其中有美日“共同防御援助协定”和其他三个有关协定，强迫人民为重整军备而勒紧腰带的一九五四年度预算案（参院未通过），以及扩充美国雇佣兵、成立变相军部的“自卫队法”和“防卫厅组织法”，箝制言论出版自由的“国防机密保护法”，剥夺学校教职员政治权利的两项教育法等。这一系列反动法案，都是为了使吉田政府能够放手执行复活军国主义充当美国侵略工具的政策。
    但是，日本人民反对美国和吉田集团重新武装日本的强大斗争，加深和扩大了在野党派和统治集团之间的矛盾，使得吉田自由党虽因勾结战犯重光葵的改进党而控制了国会众院五分之三、参院五分之二以上的票，可是它强迫国会通过反动法案时仍然遭到了重重打击。吉田集团的大贪污案接二连三地在国会中被揭发出来；许多重要反动法案都未能迅速通过，吉田集团竟数次强制延长国会会期，并在国会中演出全武行，殴打反对延长国会会期的在野党派议员。吉田反动政府因而更加威信扫地，摇摇欲坠。
    国会开幕不久，大贪污案就一个接一个地被揭发出来，给了吉田集团一个当头棒喝。“保全经济会”行贿案和造船贷款舞弊案等大贪污案件，都牵连到吉田集团里的显要人物。二月十九日，在野党议员在国会中公布商人森胁将光的记事录中说，去年五月到今年一月间，自由党干事长佐藤荣作，政务调查会长池田勇人、吉田内阁外相冈崎胜男、法相犬养健、国务相大野伴睦、农林相保利茂、内阁官房长官福永健司以及国家银行的日本银行总裁一万田尚登等人，仅仅接受造船商人的奢华的艺妓招待会就有五十多次。吉田集团的高级官员和国会议员的贪污丑行竟达到这样的程度：接受巨额贿赂而制订法令，出卖国家权益给大资本家。例如，吉田集团的显要人物接受造船商人们的贿赂后，去年操纵国会通过了“远洋航船建造贷款利息补给及损失补偿法案”，用人民的捐税使以三井、三菱等财阀为主的造船公司取得了二百五十多亿日元的巨额利润。轮船公司由于接受“计划造船”订货的利润巨大，因而就竭力贿赂政府高级官员和国会议员，以取得分配的造船订货，贿赂的行市每艘竟高到一千万日元（约合三万美元）。
    这些大贪污案被连续揭发后，全国舆论譁然，群情愤慨。吉田集团用尽各种方式，甚至用美国占领者的干预，企图来搪塞贪污案件。及至后来掩盖不住，四月二十日东京地方检察厅决定要逮捕接受造船公司贿赂的自由党干事长佐藤荣作时，吉田集团竟恼羞成怒地使用权力阻止逮捕。这一公然包庇贪污的可耻行为，引起日本人民和舆论更加不可抑阻的愤怒。四月二十二日，在野党派议员提出了要求吉田内阁辞职的不信任案，几乎使吉田内阁倒台。吉田集团虽然以微弱的多数否决了不信任案，但是连资产阶级报纸“日本经济新闻”也评论说：“吉田政权以多数票而维持了政权，但是人民并不支持这些票。”“读卖新闻”也承认：“政府的所作所为，只不过是死皮赖脸地硬要把持政权的丑恶挣扎而已。”
    吉田集团的许多反动法案，由于在野党派议员的攻击，在国会中被延搁下来。三月四日吉田集团操纵众院通过的一九五四年度“紧缩”预算案，就一直没有能在参院通过。到了五月八日法定的国会闭会日期时，“自卫队法”、“防卫厅组织法”、
  “国防机密保护法”、新警察法和两项教育法等反动法案，都未能在参院通过。因而吉田集团竟不顾在野党议员的反对，一再强使国会延长会期。
    六月三日，国会已经是在吉田集团强迫下第三次延长会期的最后一天了。吉田满以为国会将能通过全部反动法案而闭幕，他便决定在六月四日到华盛顿去和艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯“会谈”，拿国会通过的一系列反动法案作为“献礼”，换取主人更大的“援助”。同时，他还打算由华盛顿到伦敦、巴黎、西德、意大利和泰国去作“世界旅行”。但是，到了三日晚上，新警察法案还是不能在国会通过，吉田集团又要求国会第四次延期，众院中的共产党、劳农党、左派社会党、右派社会党议员表示坚决反对。全武行就在国会演出了。当左、右派社会党阻止强迫延长会期时，吉田的自由党议员竟然动手殴打起来，并出动了两百名警察前来包围国会，并加入殴打，许多议员受了伤。一直闹到夜深十二时，众院议长才站在会场入口附近非法地片面宣布国会第四度延期两天。四日，左、右派社会党发表联合声明，指出十九届国会已经在六月三日闭幕，并要求吉田内阁全体辞职。社会党的斗争得到了共产党、劳农党的支持。虽然后来吉田集团又强行宣布第五次延长国会会期十天，并在参院非法“通过”了新警察法，但是，共产党，劳农党，左、右派社会党以及保守党的一些议员，从四日起都拒绝出席国会。
    吉田集团的这一暴行，又一次引起了日本人民和舆论的指责。日本共产党中央机关报“赤旗报”发表社论，支持社会党在国会中的斗争。六月十九日，东京市举行了两万人的群众大会，抗议吉田集团的暴行，要求吉田内阁辞职并解散国会。六月二十日，日本新闻工会联合会全国大会，也要求吉田政府立即辞职，重行举行大选。
    吉田集团这个空前暴行的发生，不是偶然的。反动卖国、腐败不堪的吉田集团，已经不得不依靠暴力来维持它的反动统治了。甚至美联社也承认：“有三十个保镖的吉田，每天都被指为‘不知羞耻的独裁者’——甚至还更坏。”
    原来大摇大摆地准备赴美的吉田茂，一再受到国会在野党议员的打击后，只好神色颓丧地宣布无限期延缓他的“出国”日期了。华盛顿安排好了的美日军事会谈，也就不能如期举行了。美国统治集团对此极为恼怒。共同社纽约专电报道，美国对于
  “盟邦”日本的出丑，“深深感到忧虑”。美国驻日大使艾利逊对记者发表的声明中公开表示：“美国感到十分失望”。
    吉田集团在国会中受到的打击，是日本人民反对美国重新武装日本和奴役日本人民的战争政策和殖民政策、反对吉田反动政府的卖国行为的斗争的反映。日本共产党中央指导部在十一日向劳农党，左、右派社会党以及日本工会总评议会等二百个民主团体发表呼吁，呼吁社会党、劳农党、共产党紧密携手，各民主团体站在人民斗争的前列，来共同展开全国人民行动一致的打倒吉田内阁的反法西斯斗争。
