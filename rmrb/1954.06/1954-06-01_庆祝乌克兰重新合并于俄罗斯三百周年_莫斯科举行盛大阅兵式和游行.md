    Moscow held a grand military parade and a procession of working people on May 30th to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia.

    On this day, the festive attire of Red Square symbolized the friendship of all nationalities, with the flags of the Soviet Union and its constituent republics shining brightly. The buildings opposite the Kremlin were adorned with green wreaths and relief portraits of Lenin and Stalin. The number "300" glittered in the sunlight. The facade of the Historical Museum was decorated with a model of the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, surrounded by Russian and Ukrainian designs.

    Attending the ceremony were representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, production innovators, scientists, and cultural workers from Moscow's industries, as well as representatives of the Ukrainian people and working people from other constituent republics who attended the celebration meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation on the 29th. Also present were representatives of the Parliament of the Polish People's Republic, members of foreign delegations invited to Moscow by Soviet social organizations, and diplomatic personnel from various countries stationed in the Soviet Union.

    Leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Government, leaders of the Communist Parties and governments of Ukraine and other constituent republics, marshals, and generals stood on the platform of the Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum.

    The Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, Marshal of the Soviet Union Bulganin, reviewed the troops and delivered a speech. He spoke about the historical facts of the unification of Ukraine and Russia and the deeds of the outstanding Ukrainian politician and commander Bogdan Khmelnitsky, the traditional friendship between the Ukrainian and Russian peoples that has been continuously consolidated and developed in the past struggles against domestic and foreign enemies, in the October Revolution, and in the struggle to build socialism and communism, as well as the glorious achievements of the Ukrainian Republic. He said: As a result of implementing the Soviet nationalities policy based on the theories and instructions of our great leader and teacher Lenin, the free socialist nations in our country have achieved unprecedented unity. The friendship of all nationalities has become a powerful driving force of Soviet society and a source of the strength and consolidation of our country.

    At the end of Bulganin's speech, thunderous cries of "Hurrah" resounded in Red Square. Then, the sound of gun salutes and the solemn music of the Soviet national anthem intertwined.

    The military parade began. Students of military academies marched at the head of the reviewing column. Officers of the Air Force, tank troops, and artillery marched past the reviewing stand in dense formations. Many chests gleamed with medals. Among the ranks were children of all nationalities, Russian soldiers who had participated in the battles to liberate Ukraine from the rule of the Nazi aggressors, and Ukrainian soldiers who, together with all the Soviet people, built a wall of iron and steel near Moscow in the autumn of 1941.

    Soldiers of the Navy and border guards marched across Red Square. Behind them were armored vehicles carrying infantry and various cannons. Jet planes swept across the sky like silver arrows.

    After the parade, the procession began. Accompanied by music and songs, the vast crowd of Moscow people marched past the walls of the Kremlin. At this time, Red Square resembled a colorful carpet of flowers. Everywhere were flowers, flags, the number "300," and the words "Forever Together," everywhere were portraits of Lenin, Stalin, and the leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Government, as well as the national flags and emblems of Ukraine and Russia. Colorful banners illustrated the fraternal relations between the Russian and Ukrainian peoples and the friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union. The workers' contingents carried charts and slogans illustrating their labor achievements.

    On this joyous holiday, the people of Moscow warmly welcomed their Ukrainian brothers, and they also paid tribute to the working people of democratic countries and all those who are fighting for peace, democracy, and socialism. The marchers held high the portraits of the party and government leaders of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the German Democratic Republic, and other people's democratic countries. In addition, they carried portraits of the leaders of the Communist Parties of France, Italy, the United States, Spain, the United Kingdom, India, and Brazil.

    Hundreds of thousands of Moscow working people participated in the festive procession.

    At the same time, festive carnivals were held by the working people in various parks, gardens, and many squares. Actors from Moscow's best theaters and more than three hundred amateur art groups performed at many shows. Tens of thousands of Muscovites came to the Gorky Central Park of Culture and Rest to meet with Russian and Ukrainian writers and visit the exhibition celebrating the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia. When night fell, fireworks were set off, and colorful fireworks illuminated the night sky. Moscow fired twenty salvos in celebration of this great festival of the Ukrainian and Russian peoples and all the nationalities of the Soviet Union.

    莫斯科举行盛大阅兵式和游行
    据新华社讯：五月三十日，莫斯科举行盛大的阅兵式和劳动人民的游行，庆祝乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年。
    这一天，红场的节日盛装标志着各民族的友谊，苏联和各加盟共和国的国旗鲜艳夺目。克里姆林宫对面的建筑物上装饰着绿色的花环、列宁和斯大林的浮雕像。“三○○”这个数字在阳光下闪烁着。历史博物馆的建筑物的正面装饰着周围镶有俄罗斯和乌克兰图案的赫米尔尼茨基勋章的模型。
    参加观礼的有：苏联最高苏维埃和俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃代表，莫斯科工业的生产革新者、科学家和文化工作者，以及二十九日参加俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃庆祝大会的乌克兰人民代表和其他加盟共和国劳动人民代表。参加观礼的还有波兰人民共和国议会的代表，应苏联各社会团体的邀请到莫斯科来的各外国代表团团员，以及各国驻苏联外交人员。
    苏联共产党和苏联政府的领袖、乌克兰和其他加盟共和国的共产党和政府的领袖、元帅和将领们站在列宁斯大林陵墓台上。
    苏联国防部部长、苏联元帅布尔加宁检阅部队，并发表演说。他讲到乌克兰和俄罗斯合并的史实和乌克兰卓越的政治家和统帅赫米尔尼茨基的事迹，乌克兰人民和俄罗斯人民的传统友谊在反对国内外敌人的历次斗争中、在十月革命和建设社会主义和共产主义的斗争中日益巩固和发展的情形，以及乌克兰共和国的辉煌成就。他说：由于奉行以我们伟大的领袖和导师列宁的学说和遗训为基础的苏维埃民族政策的结果，我们国内的自由的社会主义民族达到了空前的团结。各族人民的友谊已成为苏维埃社会的强大的推动力，成为我们国家强大和巩固的源泉。
    布尔加宁演说结束时，红场上响起雷动的“乌拉”声。接着，礼炮声和苏联国歌庄严的乐声交织在一起。
    阅兵式开始。走在检阅队伍最前面的是军事学院的学生。空军、坦克兵和炮兵的军官们以密集队形从检阅台前走过去。许多人的胸前闪耀着勋章。队伍中有各族人民的子弟，有曾参加把乌克兰从纳粹侵略者统治下解放出来的各次战役的俄罗斯战士，有一九四一年秋天和所有的苏联人民一道在莫斯科附近筑成一道铜墙铁壁的乌克兰的战士们。
    海军和边防军的士兵从红场上经过。后面是载着步兵的装甲车辆和各种大炮。喷气式飞机像银箭一样横空掠过。
    检阅完毕以后，游行开始。随着乐声和歌声，莫斯科人民浩浩荡荡的队伍从克里姆林宫的宫墙下面走过去。这时，红场像一块花团锦簇的大地毡。到处是花朵、旗帜和“三○○”这个数字及“永远在一起”的字样，到处是列宁、斯大林和苏联共产党与苏联政府领袖的画像，还有乌克兰和俄罗斯的国旗和国徽。五色缤纷的标语牌说明了俄罗斯和乌克兰人民之间的兄弟般的关系和苏联各族人民的友谊。工人的队伍里举着说明劳动成就的图表和标语牌。
    在这个欢乐的节日，莫斯科人民热烈地欢迎他们的乌克兰兄弟，他们也向民主国家劳动人民和一切为和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的人民致敬。游行的人们高举着中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国、德意志民主共和国和其他人民民主国家的党和政府领袖的画像。此外，他们还拿着法国、意大利、美国、西班牙、英国、印度和巴西共产党领袖的画像。
    数十万莫斯科劳动人民参加了节日的游行。
    同时在各个公园、花园中和许多广场上，劳动人民举行了节日狂欢。莫斯科最好的剧院的演员和三百多个业余艺术团体在许多表演会上表演。数以万计的莫斯科人来到高尔基中央文化休息公园，与俄罗斯和乌克兰作家会晤，并参观庆祝乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年的展览会。当夜幕降临的时候，礼炮响了，五色缤纷的焰火照亮了夜空。莫斯科鸣炮二十响，庆祝乌克兰和俄罗斯人民以及苏联各族人民这个伟大的节日。
