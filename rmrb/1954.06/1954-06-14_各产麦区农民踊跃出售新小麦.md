    (Xinhua News Agency, 13th) In June, the amount of new wheat sold by farmers in several southern provinces continues to increase, and wheat in major northern wheat-producing areas is successively entering the market. From the southwest region of Yunnan and Guizhou to the coastal provinces at the end of April and the beginning of May, farmers have begun to sell new wheat to the state. In many areas, the state conducted pre-purchase programs before the wheat harvest, and farmers delivered grain and settled accounts according to the contracts. Since early May, the amount of wheat sold by farmers has greatly increased. The state-owned grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in Fujian Province purchased more than 64 percent more in the 25 days of May than in April, and some counties have already exceeded their annual purchase plans. The purchase volume in Sichuan Province in the first five days of mid-May also increased by more than one and a half times compared to the last five days of early May.

    In early June, good news of bumper harvests came from major wheat-producing areas such as Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Hebei, and Anhui. In areas where harvesting started earlier, farmers began to sell new wheat with the joy of harvest. Farmers in Henan Province and southern Shandong and Hebei Provinces sold grain early, and some agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi Province have made decisions to sell surplus grain. Farmers in Feidong County, Anhui Province, are selling more than 200,000 catties every day. At present, the financial and economic departments of the people's governments in major wheat-producing provinces are deploying this year's planned wheat purchase work.

    各产麦区农民踊跃出售新小麦
    【新华社十三日讯】六月份，南方几省农民出售新麦的数量不断增加，北方主要产麦区小麦相继登场。四月底和五月初，从西南区的云南、贵州到沿海各省，农民已开始把新小麦卖给国家。不少地区，国家在小麦收割前进行了预购，农民都按照合同送粮、结帐。五月初旬以来，农民出售小麦的数量大有增加。福建省国营粮食部门和供销合作社五月份二十五天的收购量比四月份增加了百分之六十四以上，有些县份已超额完成了全年收购计划。四川省五月中旬前五天的收购量也比上旬后五天增加了一倍半以上。
    六月初，山东、河南、江苏、河北、安徽等主要产麦区传来了丰收捷报，收割较早的地区，农民带着丰收的喜悦开始出售新麦。河南省和山东、河北两省南部的农民都提早售粮，山西省有的农业生产合作社已作出出售余粮的决定。安徽省肥东县农民每天出售量已有二十多万斤。目前，各主要产麦省份的人民政府财政经济部门正在布置今年小麦的计划收购工作。
