The publication of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China is a major event in the political life of the Chinese people.

The "Resolution on Convening the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses at All Levels," adopted by the 20th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on January 13, 1953, stipulated the establishment of the Constitution Drafting Committee of the People's Republic of China, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, to carry out the constitution drafting work. On March 23, 1954, Comrade Mao Zedong, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, put forward the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China (Initial Draft)". After careful study and discussion by the Constitution Drafting Committee, and with the participation of more than 8,000 people from all walks of life in the discussion, the work of drafting the constitution was successfully completed on June 11. On June 14, 1954, the 30th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee decided to publish this draft constitution and discuss it among the people, in order to collect more extensive opinions for further revision, in preparation for submission to the first session of the First National People's Congress for review.

The draft constitution reflects the actual situation of the great social changes that have occurred since our people's revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It summarizes the main struggle experiences and organizational experiences of our people in the form of legislation, affirms the achievements of our people's revolution - the interests that the people have already obtained - and affirms the common aspirations of our people to gradually build our country into a socialist society.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has played the role of a provisional constitution, and practical life has proved the correctness of this program. The draft constitution is based on the Common Program. The preamble to the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China reads: "This constitution is based on the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949 and is a development of the Common Program." Some of the fundamental principles stipulated in the Common Program have been affirmed in the draft constitution; at the same time, because practical life has already developed forward, the draft constitution has added many new provisions in terms of social system and state system, which are mainly some new specific provisions on gradually building a socialist society and strengthening the people's democratic system.

The preamble to the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China begins by stating: "After more than a century of heroic struggle, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, finally achieved the great victory of the people's revolution against imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism in 1949, thus ending the long history of being oppressed and enslaved and establishing the People's Democratic Dictatorship of the People's Republic of China. The people's democratic system of the People's Republic of China, also known as the New Democratic System, guarantees that our country can eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means and build a prosperous and happy socialist society." Article 4 of the General Program also stipulates: "The People's Republic of China relies on state organs and social forces to gradually eliminate the system of exploitation and establish a socialist society through socialist industrialization and socialist transformation."

Building a socialist society has already become the legal goal of our country in the draft constitution. The great socialist ideal pursued by countless revolutionary martyrs of the Chinese people, who shed blood and sacrificed themselves, is gradually becoming a glorious reality; the draft constitution affirms the increasingly high tide of socialist construction. After the draft constitution is formally adopted, it will play an active role in guaranteeing and promoting the healthy development of this glorious reality. How excited should all patriotic people be about this great reality and its great future!

The correctness of the draft constitution lies in the fact that its provisions on building a socialist society in our country do not rely on empty fantasies, but are based on facts and follow a practical, appropriate, and reliable path.

What is the basis for realizing socialism in our country?

Our country is a people's democratic country led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, which is the political foundation for realizing socialism; our state-owned economy is an economy of ownership by the whole people, which is the economic foundation for realizing socialism. According to statistics from 1952, the proportion of industrial products in our country's national economy has increased from about 10 percent before liberation to 28 percent; in modern industry, state-owned industry of a socialist nature has accounted for 50.7 percent; state-owned and cooperative commerce has accounted for more than 50 percent of the total domestic commodity sales. The cooperative economy of agriculture and handicrafts also occupies a very important position in the national economy. At the end of 1953, there were 14,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the country, which have now developed to 95,000. Capitalist industry and commerce are gradually embarking on the road of state capitalism. The political, economic, and cultural living standards of the broad masses of people are improving day by day, and the broad masses of people yearn for a happy socialist life. These facts are the starting point for the draft constitution to stipulate striving for the establishment of a socialist society.

However, to build a socialist society, it is necessary to go through gradual transitional steps. The so-called gradual transition means relying on the increasing development and growth of the socialist material base, while also relying on the increasing improvement of the people's awareness of socialism.

The preamble to the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China states: "From the founding of the People's Republic of China to the completion of a socialist society, this is a transitional period. The general task of the state during the transition period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce." Many provisions of the General Program of the draft constitution have made completely reasonable provisions in all these aspects.

In our country, on the one hand, there is state ownership of the means of production, that is, ownership by the whole people, and there is also cooperative ownership; on the other hand, there is also individual laborers' ownership and capitalist ownership. That is to say, the socialist economy and the non-socialist economy now coexist. This is the basic characteristic of our country's transition period. According to this actual situation and the direction of our country's development , the draft constitution stipulates that the socialist economy of ownership by the whole people "is the leadership force in the national economy and the material basis for the state to realize socialist transformation"; it also stipulates that the state protects the ownership of privately owned means of production and other properties in accordance with the law, while stipulating that the state encourages individual economy to gradually transform into a cooperative economy through specific transitional forms based on the principle of voluntariness; and it stipulates that the state encourages and guides capitalist industry and commerce "to transform into various forms of state capitalist economy, gradually replacing capitalist ownership with ownership by the whole people." The draft constitution also stipulates that "the state prohibits anyone from using private property to undermine public interests." All these provisions will guarantee the victorious completion of our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, and will guarantee that our people will move towards a happy socialist society without exploitation.

To ensure a gradual transition to a socialist society, it is necessary to further develop the democratization of our country in order to strengthen the connection between state organs and the people, and to improve the people's political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm.

Article 2 of the General Program of the draft constitution stipulates: "All power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise their power are the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at all levels." That is to say, the power of the people of our country is realized by the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at all levels. Article 2 of the General Program of the draft constitution also stipulates: "The National People's Congress, the local people's congresses at all levels, and other state organs, all implement democratic centralism." The so-called democratic centralism means that, first, our country's state power organs are elected by the people and are supervised by voters or electoral units, and voters or electoral units have the right to remove their representatives in accordance with the law. Second, our country's state administrative organs and courts and procuratorial organs are all produced by the state power organs, are responsible to the state power organs and report their work, and are supervised by the state power organs; the administrative organs at all levels in our country, both central and local, are the executive organs of the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at all levels; the state power organs have the right to dismiss all members of the state organs produced by it. Third, democratic centralism also includes the combination of the initiative and creativity of the central and local governments, and includes the principle that the lower level is subordinate to the higher level and the local is subordinate to the central government. These provisions and other provisions of the draft constitution guarantee that the people of the whole country can truly be masters of their own affairs in the life of the country, and guarantee that state organs and their staff can honestly serve the people.

To ensure a gradual transition to a socialist society, it is also necessary to further strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups in the country.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, all ethnic groups in our country have united to become a free and equal family of nationalities. Facts have proved that only in a country led by the working class and its vanguard party, the Communist Party, can the problems of relations between ethnic groups in the country be truly solved. Article 3 of the General Program of the draft constitution stipulates: "The People's Republic of China is a unified multi-ethnic country," "All ethnic groups are equal," "Regional autonomy is practiced in areas where minority ethnic groups live in concentrated communities," and so on. Section 5 of Chapter 2 of the draft constitution also makes special provisions for the autonomous organs of ethnic autonomous areas. Following the direction of these provisions in the draft constitution will guarantee greater unity among the various ethnic groups in our country and guarantee the common prosperity and progress of all ethnic groups.

The draft constitution stipulates that all citizens of our country enjoy equal rights and perform certain obligations. All citizens who have reached the age of 18 have the right to vote and to stand for election; all citizens have freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, procession, and demonstration, have the right to education, and also have freedom of religious belief; citizens have the right to appeal to state organs at all levels against any state organ staff who violate the law or neglect their duties. The state guarantees citizens the right to work, workers the right to rest, and workers who are old, sick, or have lost their ability to work also have the right to receive material assistance. Women enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social, and family life; marriage, family, mothers, and children are protected by the state. Under the people's democratic system, the rights enjoyed by the people of our country, as proven by the facts of the past five years, are gradually expanding, and must continue to expand with the development of the country's economic construction.

Of course, in our country, the rights and obligations of citizens should not be separated. Therefore, the draft constitution also stipulates that citizens have the obligations to abide by the law, cherish public property, pay taxes, and perform military service. These obligations are all in line with the vital interests of the people of our country, and are closely related to the various rights enjoyed by citizens. All these rights and obligations are necessary to consolidate and defend our country, to guarantee the happy life of the broad masses of the people, and to realize the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

Now, the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has been published before the people of the whole country. This draft constitution represents a new upsurge in our country's democratic construction and socialist construction. The constitution of the people of our country cannot be compared with the constitutions of any bourgeois country used to oppress and exploit the people. The constitution of the people of our country is a truly democratic constitution belonging to the socialist type. All of our people must actively participate in the discussion of the fundamental law of the country, which is related to the vital interests of each individual, put forward opinions, and concentrate the wisdom of the people of the whole country, so that the draft of this first constitution of our people can be revised and improved. With this constitution as a weapon, we will surely be able to continuously achieve victory in the great cause of building socialism in our country.

We fully believe that the general task of our country during the transition period, as pointed out in the preamble to the draft constitution, relying on the people's democratic united front led by the Communist Party of China, relying on the fraternal mutual assistance and unity of all ethnic groups in the country, and relying on the friendly unity of our country and the great Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the peace-loving people of the world, will surely be victoriously realized. All the conspiracies and sabotage carried out by reactionary forces at home and abroad against our construction cause must be smashed to pieces by our victorious iron fists.

Let us confidently conduct a nationwide discussion on the draft constitution, and warmly prepare to welcome the birth of the first constitution of the Chinese people!

### 在全国人民中广泛地展开讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案

    在全国人民中广泛地展开讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案
    中华人民共和国宪法草案的公布是中国人民政治生活中的一个重大事件。
    一九五三年一月十三日中央人民政府委员会第二十次会议通过的“关于召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会的决议”中，规定成立以毛泽东同志为首的中华人民共和国宪法起草委员会，进行宪法起草工作。一九五四年三月二十三日毛泽东同志代表中国共产党中央委员会提出“中华人民共和国宪法草案（初稿）”，经过宪法起草委员会周密的研究和讨论，并组织各方面人士八千多人参加讨论，至六月十一日顺利地完成了宪法起草的工作。一九五四年六月十四日中央人民政府委员会第三十次会议决定把这个宪法草案公布并在全民中讨论，以便收集更广泛的意见，再作修改，准备提交第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议审查。
    宪法草案反映了我们人民革命和中华人民共和国成立以来所出现的伟大社会变革的实际情况，用立法的形式总结了我国人民的主要的斗争经验和组织经验，把我国人民革命的成果——人民已经得到的利益肯定下来，并且把我国人民要在我国逐步建成社会主义社会这一个共同的愿望肯定下来。
    中华人民共和国成立以来，中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领曾经起了临时宪法的作用，实际生活证明了这个纲领的正确。宪法草案是以共同纲领为基础的。中华人民共和国宪法草案的序言写道：“这个宪法以一九四九年的中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领为基础，又是共同纲领的发展。”共同纲领所规定的一些根本原则在宪法草案中被肯定下来；同时，因为实际生活已经向前发展了，这样，宪法草案在社会制度和国家制度方面增加了许多新的规定，这主要地就是关于逐步建成社会主义社会和加强人民民主制度的一些新的具体的规定。
    中华人民共和国宪法草案的序言一开头就写道：“中国人民经过一百多年的英勇奋斗，终于在中国共产党领导下，在一九四九年取得了反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的人民革命的伟大胜利，因而结束了长时期被压迫、被奴役的历史，建立了人民民主专政的中华人民共和国。中华人民共和国的人民民主制度，也就是新民主主义制度，保证我国能够通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。”总纲第四条又规定：“中华人民共和国依靠国家机关和社会力量，通过社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，保证逐步消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会。”
    建设社会主义社会已经在宪法草案中成为我们国家的法定的目标。中国人民的无数革命先烈，流血牺牲所追求的社会主义的伟大理想，正在逐步变成光辉的现实；宪法草案肯定了社会主义建设的日益高涨这个现实，而当这个宪法草案被正式通过之后，就会对于这个光辉的现实的健康发展，起着积极的保证和促进的作用。一切爱国的人民对于这个伟大的现实和它的伟大前途，该是怎样欢欣鼓舞啊！
    宪法草案的正确性，是在于它关于在我国建设社会主义社会的规定，不是依靠空洞的幻想，而是根据事实和按照切实的适当的可靠的道路。
    在我国实现社会主义的基础是什么呢？
    我们的国家是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家，这是实现社会主义的政治基础；我们的国营经济是全民所有制的经济，这是实现社会主义的经济基础。据一九五二年的统计，我国工业产品在国民经济中所占的比重，已经由解放前百分之十左右增加到百分之二十八；在现代化的工业中，社会主义性质的国营工业已经占百分之五十点七；国营和合作社的商业在国内商品销售总额中已经占百分之五十以上。农业和手工业的合作社经济在国民经济生活中也占很重要的地位，在一九五三年底全国有农业生产合作社一万四千个，现在已经发展到九万五千个。资本主义的工商业正在逐步地走上国家资本主义的道路。广大人民的政治、经济和文化生活水平一天天在提高着，广大人民渴望着社会主义的幸福生活。这些事实就是宪法草案规定为建立社会主义社会而奋斗的出发点。
    但是，要建成社会主义社会，必须经过逐步过渡的步骤。所谓逐步过渡，这就是要依靠社会主义物质基础的日益发展和日益壮大，同时是要依靠人民群众对于社会主义觉悟的日益提高。
    中华人民共和国宪法草案的序言写道：“从中华人民共和国成立到社会主义社会建成，这是一个过渡时期。国家在过渡时期的总任务，是逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。”宪法草案总纲的许多条文在这一切方面作了完全合情合理的规定。
    在我们的国家里，一方面有了生产资料的国家所有制即全民所有制，也有了合作社所有制；另一方面还有个体劳动者所有制，也有资本家所有制。这就是说，社会主义的经济与非社会主义的经济现在是同时并存着的。这就是我国过渡时期的基本特点。根据这种实际状况和我们国家发展的方向，宪法草案规定了全民所有制的社会主义经济“是国民经济中的领导力量和国家实现社会主义改造的物质基础”；还规定了国家依照法律分别保护私有的生产资料和其他财产的所有权，同时规定了国家鼓励个体经济根据自愿的原则，经过具体的过渡形式，逐步转变为合作社所有制的经济；并规定了国家鼓励和指导资本主义工商业“转变为各种不同形式的国家资本主义经济，逐步以全民所有制代替资本家所有制”。宪法草案还规定了“国家禁止任何人利用私有财产破坏公共利益”。所有这些规定，将保证我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的胜利完成，将保证我国人民走到没有剥削的幸福的社会主义社会中去。
    要保证逐步过渡到社会主义社会，需要进一步发展我们国家的民主化，以加强国家机关和人民群众之间的联系，提高人民群众的政治积极性和劳动积极性。
    宪法草案总纲第二条规定：“中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。人民行使权力的机关是全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会。”这就是说，我国人民的权力是由全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会来实现的。宪法草案总纲第二条又规定：“全国人民代表大会、地方各级人民代表大会和其他国家机关，一律实行民主集中制。”所谓民主集中制，这就是说，第一，我国国家权力机关是由人民选举产生的，并受选民或选举单位的监督，选民或选举单位依照法律有权撤换自己的代表。第二，我国国家行政机关和法院及检察机关都是由国家权力机关产生的，向国家权力机关负责和报告工作，并受国家权力机关的监督；我国中央和地方的各级行政机关乃是全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会的执行机关；国家权力机关对于由它所产生的一切国家机关的组成人员有权罢免。第三，民主集中制同时还包含中央与地方的积极性创造性相结合，包含下级服从上级、地方服从中央的原则。宪法草案这些规定以及其他规定，就保证了全国人民在国家生活中真正能够当家作主，保证了国家机关和它的工作人员能够老老实实地为人民服务。
    要保证逐步过渡到社会主义社会，还需要国内各民族团结的进一步加强。 
    中华人民共和国成立以来，我国各民族已经团结成为一个自由平等的民族大家庭。事实证明：只有在工人阶级和它的先锋队共产党领导下的国家，才能够真正解决国内各民族关系的问题。宪法草案总纲第三条规定：“中华人民共和国是统一的多民族的国家”，“各民族一律平等”，“各少数民族聚居的地方实行区域自治”，等等。宪法草案第二章第五节还对于民族自治地方的自治机关作了专门的规定。循着宪法草案这些规定的方向前进，将保证我国各民族更加团结，并保证各民族的共同繁荣和进步。
    宪法草案规定我国公民一律享受平等的权利，履行一定的义务。凡是年满十八岁的公民都有选举权和被选举权；一切公民都有言论、出版、集会、结社、游行和示威的自由，有受教育的权利，也有宗教信仰的自由；公民有向各级国家机关控诉任何违法失职的国家机关工作人员的权利。国家保证公民有劳动的权利，劳动者有休息的权利，年老、疾病或者丧失了劳动能力的劳动者还有获得物质帮助的权利。妇女在政治、经济、文化、社会和家庭的生活各方面享有同男子平等的权利；婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童都受到国家的保护。在人民民主制度下，我国人民所享受的这些权利，将近五年以来的事实证明，正在逐步地扩大，今后一定还要随着国家经济建设事业的发展而不断地扩大。
    当然，在我们的国家里，公民的权利和义务是不应该分开的。因此，宪法草案也规定了公民有遵守法律、爱护公共财产、纳税和服兵役等的义务。这些义务都是符合我国人民的切身利益的，是和公民享受的各种权利密切相关联的。这一切权利和义务都是为了巩固和保卫我们的国家、为了保证广大人民的幸福生活、为了实现社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业所必需的。
    现在，中华人民共和国宪法草案已经公布在全国人民的面前了。这个宪法草案表现着我国人民的民主主义建设和社会主义建设的新高涨。我国人民的宪法是任何资产阶级国家用来压迫和剥削人民的宪法所不能比拟的。我国人民的宪法是属于社会主义类型的真正民主的宪法。我们全国人民对于关系每个人自己的切身利益的国家根本大法，一定要积极地参加讨论，提出意见，集中全国人民的智慧，使我国人民这个第一部宪法的草案修改得更加完善。以这个宪法为武器，我们就一定能够使我国建设社会主义的伟大事业，继续不断地取得胜利。
    我们完全相信，我们国家过渡时期的总任务，如同宪法草案的序言中所指出的，依靠以中国共产党为领导的人民民主统一战线，依靠国内各民族的友爱互助和团结，依靠我国和伟大的苏联、各人民民主国家、全世界爱好和平人民的友好团结，一定能够胜利实现。国内和国外的一切反动势力对于我们的建设事业所进行的阴谋破坏，一定要被我们胜利的铁拳打得粉碎。
    让我们充满信心地进行对宪法草案的全民讨论，热烈地准备迎接中国人民的第一个宪法的诞生吧！
