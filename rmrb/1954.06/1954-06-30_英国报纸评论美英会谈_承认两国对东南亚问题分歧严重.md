Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 28th (TASS dispatch): The President's Press Secretary released the joint communiqué of Eisenhower and Churchill to reporters. The communiqué reiterated the principles of American and British policy towards Western Europe and Southeast Asia, and stated: "Continued delays in the entry into force of the European Defense Community Treaty and the Bonn Treaty will be detrimental to the unity of the North Atlantic nations."

Xinhua News Agency, London, June 28th (TASS dispatch): British newspapers are paying close attention to the Anglo-American talks in Washington. Some newspapers reported that although Eisenhower, Dulles, Churchill, and Eden met frequently, the fundamental differences between Britain and the the United States remain unresolved.

The Washington correspondent of the "Times" wrote that negotiations at the White House will continue in the hope of easing Anglo-American differences on the Southeast Asian issue.

The Washington correspondent for the "Daily Herald" believes that Anglo-American differences on Southeast Asia remain serious. The reporter wrote: "Churchill and Eisenhower, after three days of talks in Washington, could not even agree on issuing a polite communiqué.

"Churchill and Eden, seeing no prospect of reaching an agreement, stayed at the White House on the evening of June 25th instead of going to the British Embassy as originally planned. They stayed to make another effort to reach a mutual understanding. Eisenhower revealed that Churchill and Eden stubbornly opposed Dulles' rigid strategy of concluding a Southeast Asia pact as soon as possible."

The Washington correspondent of the "Daily Express" quoted British officials in Washington as saying that these officials said:
"Britain will not depart from the position Eden has already stated in the House of Commons; that is, it will not take any extraordinary measures immediately to establish an organization in Southeast Asia, and Britain will not decide immediately to stop negotiations with Chinese and Indochinese Communist leaders."

On the other hand, some newspapers insisted that as a result of the negotiations, although Anglo-American differences will not be eliminated, they will be reduced to some extent.

    英国报纸评论美英会谈
    承认两国对东南亚问题分歧严重
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社华盛顿二十八日讯：总统新闻秘书向记者们发表了艾森豪威尔和邱吉尔的联合公报。公报中重申了美国和英国对西欧和东南亚政策的原则，并说：“欧洲防务集团条约和波恩条约如继续拖延不能生效，将给北大西洋国家的团结带来损失。”
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十八日讯：英国报纸很注意在华盛顿进行的英美会谈。有些报纸报道说，虽然艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯和邱吉尔、艾登时常见面，英美之间的基本分歧却依然没有解决。
    “泰晤士报”驻华盛顿记者写道，白宫里的谈判将继续举行，以期达到缓和英美在东南亚问题上的分歧。
    “每日先驱报”驻华盛顿记者认为，英美在东南亚问题上的分歧仍然是严重的。记者写道：“邱吉尔和艾森豪威尔在华盛顿经过三天会谈之后，甚至在发表一个有礼貌的公报这一问题上都无法取得一致意见。
    “邱吉尔和艾登由于看不到达成协议的前景，六月二十五日晚就留在白宫里，而没有按原来的计划到英国大使馆去。他们留下来，是想再次努力设法取得相互间的谅解。艾森豪威尔透露说，邱吉尔和艾登顽固地反对杜勒斯要尽速订立一个东南亚公约的硬性策略。”
    “每日快报”驻华盛顿记者引述了英国驻华盛顿的外交官员的谈话，他说，这些官员们曾说：
  “英国将不会离开艾登在下院的演说中已表示过的立场；这就是说，将不会立即采取任何非常措施，以建立东南亚的组织，并且英国也不会决定立即停止和中国及印度支那共产党领袖的谈判。”
    另一方面有些报纸却硬说，谈判的结果，英美的分歧虽然不会消除，但总会有一定程度的减轻。
