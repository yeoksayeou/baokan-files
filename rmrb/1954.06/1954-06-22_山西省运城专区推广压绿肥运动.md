    Shanxi Province, Yuncheng Prefecture Promotes Green Manure Movement
    The farmers of Yuncheng Prefecture, Shanxi Province, are actively carrying out a green manure planting movement on wheat stubble land to create conditions for increased wheat production next year. The Yuncheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office convened a meeting of responsible personnel from the agricultural and forestry departments and technology extension stations of various counties in May, specifically to study and deploy the work of planting green manure, planning to expand the planting area to more than 30% of the total wheat field area. Before the summer harvest, each county organized farmers to observe and compare green manure wheat fields. Generally, green manure wheat can increase production by more than 20 jin per mu, which is a great encouragement to farmers. Currently, various localities are combining the transmission of green manure technology to mobilize mutual aid and cooperative organizations to lead farmers to complete the green manure plan. In Ronghe County, more than 4,000 cooperative directors, mutual aid group leaders, and township and village cadres have received technical instruction. To solve the seed difficulties of some farmers, each county has prepared more than 5 million jin of black beans for farmers to use.
    Planting green manure involves sowing sesame, mung beans, black beans, etc., after the wheat harvest, combined with shallow plowing to remove the stubble. About a month after planting, when the seedlings grow to five or six inches high and are about to bloom, deep plowing and turning over are carried out to decompose the green seedlings into fertilizer. Yuncheng Prefecture is the main wheat-producing area in Shanxi Province, with wheat fields accounting for about 70% of the total cultivated land area, but most farmers lack the habit of accumulating fertilizer and apply very little fertilizer. Since liberation, although the area of wheat fields fertilized has gradually expanded year by year, half of the 7 million mu of wheat fields were still not fertilized last year. Last summer, at the wheat high-yield experience symposium, the Yuncheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office promoted the green manure yield increase experience of farmer Chai Youqing from Anyi County. Each county carried out planned experiments. The more than 14,000 mu experimented in Jie County, Yishi, Jishan, and Yuanqu counties all grew better than ordinary wheat. This year, this work has been expanded on the basis of this success. (Chen Zaizhong)

    山西省运城专区推广压绿肥运动
    山西省运城专区农民积极开展麦茬地压绿肥运动，为明年小麦增产创造条件。运城专署在五月间曾召开各县农林科和技术推广站负责人员会议，专门研究和布置了压绿肥工作，计划把压绿面积扩大到占麦田总面积的百分之三十以上。各县在夏收前都曾组织农民到压绿麦田里进行观摩评比，压绿小麦一般每亩都可增产二十斤以上，这对农民是一个很大的鼓舞。目前各地正结合传授压绿技术，发动互助合作组织带动农民完成压绿计划。荣河县受到技术传授的合作社长、互助组长和乡、村干部等已有四千多人。为解决部分农民的种籽困难，各县已准备黑豆五百多万斤，供应农民使用。
    压绿是在收麦后，结合浅耕灭茬播种一些芝麻、绿豆、黑豆等，种后一月左右，苗长五、六寸高，将开花时，进行深耕翻压，将青苗沤成肥料。运城专区是山西省主要产麦区，麦田占总耕地面积百分之七十左右，但大部分农民缺乏积肥习惯，施肥甚少。解放以来，麦田施肥面积虽逐年有所扩大，但去年七百万亩麦田仍有一半没有施肥。去年夏季，运城专署在小麦丰产经验座谈会上，推广了安邑县农民柴有清压绿增产经验后，各县都有计划地进行了试验，解县、猗氏、稷山、垣曲四县试验的一万四千多亩都长得比一般小麦好，今年就是在这一成功基础上扩大了这一工作。　（陈在中）
