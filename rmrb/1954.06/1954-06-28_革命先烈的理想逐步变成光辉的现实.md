    The Ideals of Revolutionary Martyrs are Gradually Becoming a Glorious Reality
      The Martyrs' Blood Was Not Shed in Vain
    Zhang Shihan, an old worker from the "February 7th" strike, felt indescribably happy and pleased when he saw the draft constitution. He couldn't help but recall the days workers lived thirty-one years ago and the scenes of the "February 7th" struggle: reactionary warlords treated workers like cattle and horses, workers worked more than ten hours a day, with no Sundays or holidays. If they wanted to rest, their wages would be deducted. Even if they took too long to urinate, their wages would be docked. After working hard for a month, the meager wages barely kept adults and children from freezing and starving. At that time, the workers could no longer endure it, so they held a strike under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. In 1923, workers of the Beijing-Hankou Railway elected representatives to establish the Beijing-Hankou Railway General Trade Union in Zhengzhou, and Zhang Shihan was also elected as a representative. However, under reactionary rule, workers did not have the freedom to organize trade unions. The warlords sent their bandit troops to disrupt the meeting and prevent the workers from holding it. But the workers did not yield, and on February 4th, the entire Beijing-Hankou Railway simultaneously held a great strike to "fight for freedom and human rights." This great strike was also subjected to persecution by the warlords, who killed dozens of comrades, including Lin Xiangqian, and arrested many worker comrades. At that time, he was on the south bank of the Yellow River and was also arrested and imprisoned for twenty-two months. He suffered severe torture in prison, and his wife could not make a living. The child was born without milk and starved to death. After liberation, Zhang Shihan's life improved day by day. This year, he is already sixty-seven years old and still serves as the director of the Jiang'an Railway Workers' Sanatorium. When he saw that the draft constitution clearly enshrined the achievements of the Chinese people's long struggle, how could he not be happy? He said, "This is the result of our struggle under the leadership of the Party for more than thirty years, and it is the realization of the aspirations of the martyrs in the 'February 7th' struggle and the revolutionary struggles of the past thirty years. The blood of our martyrs was not shed in vain, and the desire to fight for human rights and freedom has finally been realized."
      For a Better Life, For the Next Generation
    Now, the old "February 7th" workers Rong Chang and Shen Huanwen, who work at the Tianjin Locomotive Depot, listened to others reading the draft constitution with smiles on their faces. Every chapter and article of the draft constitution reminded them of the scenes when they participated in the "February 7th" strike thirty-one years ago. At that time, the working class demanded to establish its own organization—the trade union, to have democracy, freedom, human rights, and to improve their lives. They had engaged in heroic struggles with the reactionary ruling class. In the struggle, many people sacrificed, and many workers were brutally persecuted. At that time, the old worker Rong Chang worked on the Tangshan Railway, where he was elected as a trade union representative when the trade union was established. But soon, the trade union was dissolved, and the workers' own newspaper and library were also closed. Rong Chang was imprisoned for three years. After his release, the enemy wanted to arrest him several times, so he had to hide from the enemy's tracking everywhere. They had also experienced the period when Cao Kun established the constitution. When mentioning this matter, the two old men were very angry. Shen Huanwen said: "At that time, Cao Kun's relatives, friends, and brothers-in-law all had rights. They could beat people whenever they wanted, and they could arrest people whenever they wanted. The people could only starve and freeze, working like cattle and horses, and even their lives were not guaranteed!"
    The two old men couldn't help but laugh as they looked at the draft constitution. They saw that all the rights they had fought for in the "February 7th" era were clearly stipulated in the draft constitution, especially when they saw that their long-cherished wish to build our country into a prosperous and happy socialist society was written in the draft constitution, they were even more excited. They excitedly said: Don't think we are old, for a better life, for the next generation, we still have to work hard!
    The New Life of Workers at the Huaibei Salt Field
    After receiving the newspaper carrying the draft constitution, the workers of the state-owned Huaibei Salt Field on the coast of the motherland's Yellow Sea asked the reader to read it to them word by word. When the sixty-one-year-old salt worker Shi Qifa heard it, he felt both excited and indescribably sad. He thought of his life. He suffered for fifty years in the old society, living a life where he only wore a tattered sackcloth and a family of four shared one quilt. In 1946, bureaucratic capitalists fired workers, and he took the lead in staging a strike and went to reason with the capitalists on behalf of the workers. However, the capitalists still fired innocent workers. In 1947, for the issue of workers' wages, he again took the lead in striking, and as a result, he was also fired. It was not until after liberation that he returned to the salt field to work. Now, the lives of the salt workers have completely changed. Shi Qifa said that the Chinese people have sacrificed and struggled for decades to defeat the reactionaries, establish a people's democratic system led by the working class, and build a happy socialist society. Now, the constitution has firmly written down all our great achievements, and we will no longer be oppressed. In the old society, we did not control the government, we did not have our own laws, who would protect us! Who would speak for us! Xu Shiying, the director of the Tainan Field, who was recently promoted from a female worker, is a labor model and a representative of the municipal people. After seeing the draft constitution, she said: "I, a woman who was oppressed and discriminated against in the past, am now also a director and a representative of the people. This is only possible in the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party. The draft constitution has written down all our wishes, and I want to work with everyone to put all our efforts into it." Ji Xiangfa, a young worker in the Tai Pan Field, whose father was also a salt field worker before liberation, was beaten and scolded by the capitalists all day long and had no rights. He himself participated in salt production after liberation, learned technology, and lived a happy life. Ji Xiangfa said: The draft constitution also proposes that the state should care about our youth, which shows how much the motherland values us! I will definitely learn Wang Chonglun's spirit of innovation, work hard in production, and make the motherland as beautiful as a large garden.
      Thirty Years of Experience
    After seeing the draft constitution, Sun Kezhang, a worker in the forging and riveting workshop of the Lanzhou General Machinery Factory, thought of the arduous struggles of the working class over the decades. He participated in the "February 7th" struggle in 1923. At that time, he was a worker in the Daxing Yarn Factory in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province. Under the rule of imperialism and its running dogs, the feudal warlords, the workers not only did not have the most basic political rights, but also did not have the right to live. At that time, the workers in their yarn factory had low wages, and the working hours always exceeded twelve hours. He said: At that time, we could not endure this slave life. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, on "February 7th," we launched a vigorous struggle against the warlords, holding high the banner of "fighting for freedom and human rights." Although this struggle failed under the bloody massacre of imperialism and feudal warlords, the working class did not stop struggling. I was the worker representative of the roving yarn workshop at that time, and was fired for participating in the strike. Later, I went to work at the Yuyuan Yarn Factory in Tianjin, and was also fired for striking, and wandered like this for several years. In that era, how could the working class talk about enjoying the rights of freedom and equality!
    In recent years, with the restoration and development of the national economy, the material and cultural life of the workers has also gradually improved and improved. He said: Take our factory as an example, a spare-time school has been established, and we all have the opportunity to study culture and technology. More than 70% of the factory workers have entered universities; most of the workers are covered by labor insurance, and they no longer have to worry about problems such as birth, old age, illness, death, injury, and disability. I went to the sanatorium last year, and my weight also increased. All this shows that our working class has received the care of the country in all aspects. Now, the draft constitution also consolidates these rights that the people have already gained in the form of law, and guides us to transition to a happier and more fulfilling socialist society. It is also a great encouragement to our old workers.

    革命先烈的理想逐步变成光辉的现实
      烈士们的血没有白流
    “二七”老工人张士汉看到宪法草案，真有说不出的高兴和愉快。他不由地回想起三十一年前工人们过的日子和“二七”斗争的情景：反动军阀把工人当牛马，工人每天工作在十小时以上，还没有星期天，过年也没有假，要休息，就扣工资，连小便时间长了，也要扣工钱。辛辛苦苦地干一个月，拿得几个钱，大人和小孩还要受冻挨饿。当时工人实在不能忍受，就在中国共产党领导下举行了罢工。一九二三年京汉铁路的工人选代表在郑州成立京汉铁路总工会，张士汉也当选为代表。但在反动统治下，工人没有组织工会的自由，军阀们派他的匪军捣乱了会场，阻止工人开会。但是工人没有屈服，并且在二月四日全京汉铁路同时举行了伟大的“争自由，争人权”的大罢工。这次大罢工同样地遭受了军阀的迫害，他们杀死了林祥谦等数十位同志，并逮捕了很多工人同志，当时他在黄河南岸，也被捕去坐了二十二个月的牢。他在牢中受尽了酷刑，爱人无法生活。小孩生下来没有奶吃也被饿死了。解放后，张士汉的生活一天比一天好起来。今年他已经六十七岁了，还担任着江岸铁路职工业余疗养所的所长。当他看到宪法草案中明确地把中国人民长期斗争的成果固定下来了。这怎能不使人高兴呢？他说：“这是我们三十多年来在党的领导下斗争胜利的成果，是我们‘二七’斗争中以及三十多年来革命斗争中烈士遗志的实现。我们先烈的血没有白流，争人权，争自由的愿望终于实现了。”
      为了好日子，为了下一代
    现在在天津机务段工作的“二七”老工人容昌、沈焕文，满脸笑容地静听着别人朗读宪法草案。宪法草案的每章每条都使他们回忆起三十一年前参加“二七”大罢工时的情景。那时，工人阶级要求成立自己的组织——工会，要民主，要自由，要人权，要改善自己的生活，曾经和反动统治阶级进行了英勇的斗争。在斗争中，许多人牺牲了，许多工人受到了残酷的迫害。当时，老工人容昌在唐山铁路上做工，那里成立工会时，他当选为工会代表。但是不久，工会就被解散了，工人自己的报社、图书馆也都被封闭了。容昌被关了三年。释放后，敌人又几次要逮捕他，他只好到处躲开敌人的跟踪。他俩也经历过曹锟立宪的时期。提起这件事，两位老人都非常气愤，沈焕文说：“那时曹锟的亲戚、朋友、小舅子都有权利，他们想打人就打人，想捕人就捕人。人民只有挨饿受冻，做牛做马，连性命都没有保障啊！”
    两位老人看着宪法草案，就止不住欢笑。他们看到“二七”时代所要争取的一切权利都在宪法草案里有了明文规定，特别是当他们看到在宪法草案里写下了自己多年的心愿——要把我国建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会的时候，就更加兴奋了。他们激动地表示：别看我们年纪大，为了好日子，为了下一代，还得好好干他一番呢！
    淮北盐场工人的新生活
    祖国黄海边上的国营淮北盐场工人，接到登载着宪法草案的报纸后，就让读报员一字一句地念给他们听。六十一岁的老盐工时启发听了，心里又兴奋，又有说不出的心酸。他想起了自己的一生。他在旧社会里受苦五十年，终年过着身上只披一条破麻袋、一家四口人盖一条被子的日子。一九四六年，官僚资本家开除工人，他带头进行罢工，并代表工人去和资本家讲理，但是，资方还是把无辜的工人开除了。一九四七年，为工人的工资问题，他又带头罢工，结果自己也被开除了。直到解放后他才又上滩做工。现在，盐工的生活完全变了样。时启发说，中国人民几十年来牺牲奋斗就是为的打垮反动派，建立工人阶级领导的人民民主制度，建立幸福的社会主义社会。现在，宪法把我们的伟大成果都牢牢地写下来了，我们再不会受压迫了。在旧社会，我们不掌握政权，没有自己的法律，谁来保护我们啊！谁来替我们说话啊！台南场刚由女工被提拔当所长的徐士英，是劳动模范、市人民代表，她看到宪法草案后说：“我这个过去被压迫被歧视的妇女，现在也当了所长，当了人民代表，这只有在共产党领导下的新中国才有可能。宪法草案把我们的愿望都写下来了，我要和大家一起，拿出全部劲头来干。”台判场青年工人纪祥发的父亲，解放前也是盐场工人，整天受资本家的打骂，没有一点权利。他自己在解放后参加了盐业生产，学会了技术，过上了幸福的生活。纪祥发说：宪法草案里还提出国家要关怀我们青年，这说明祖国对我们青年多么重视啊！我一定学习王崇伦的革新精神，努力生产，使祖国建设得像大花园一样。
      三十年来的经历
    兰州通用机器厂锻铆车间工人孙克章看到宪法草案以后，想起了数十年来工人阶级艰苦斗争的情况。他参加过一九二三年“二七”斗争。那时他是河北省石家庄大兴纱厂的工人，在帝国主义及其走狗封建军阀的统治下，工人不但得不到起码的政治权利，连生活的权利也没有。那时，他们纱厂的工人，工资少，工作时间总是超过十二小时。他说：当时我们不能忍受这种奴隶生活，在中国共产党的领导下，在“二七”这天，就向军阀展开了轰轰烈烈的斗争，高举起“争自由、争人权”斗争的大旗。这个斗争虽然在帝国主义和封建军阀血腥的屠杀下失败了，但是工人阶级并没有停止进行斗争。我那时是粗纱车间的工人代表，由于参加了大罢工被开除了。后来跑到天津裕源纱厂做工，也因罢工被开除了，这样流浪了好几年。工人阶级在那个时代里，哪能谈到享受自由、平等的权利啊！
    几年来随着国家经济的恢复和发展，工人的物质和文化生活也逐步改善和提高了。他说：就拿我们工厂来说，成立了业余学校，我们都有了学习文化和技术的机会，全厂职工百分之七十以上都入了大学；多数职工都受到劳动保险的待遇，再也不用耽心生、老、病、死、伤、残等问题。我去年到休养院去休养，体重也增加了。这一切说明了我们工人阶级在各方面都得到了国家的关怀。现在，宪法草案又以法律形式，巩固了这些人民既得的权利，并指导我们过渡到更加幸福美满的社会主义社会。它对我们老工人的鼓舞也是很大的。
