Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 13th: According to TASS, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, G.M. Malenkov, received the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, O. Grotewohl, on June 11th. Prime Minister Grotewohl is about to return to his country after receiving medical treatment and rest in the Soviet Union.

Present at the reception were Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, A.I. Mikoyan, and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, V.A. Zorin. The conversation took place in an atmosphere of harmony and friendship.

During the conversation, issues of concern to the government of the German Democratic Republic and the government of the Soviet Union were discussed. Prime Minister Grotewohl pointed out the rising patriotic movement in West Germany, which aims to abolish the treaties on the establishment of the "European Defense Community," as the abolition of these treaties is a condition for the reunification of Germany. He pointed out that influential figures in West Germany who uphold national interests believe that West Germany's one-sided economic relations are an obstacle to establishing beneficial relations with the Soviet Union. In this regard, Prime Minister Grotewohl expressed the hope that the Soviet government would carefully consider the requests that relevant parties in West Germany might make regarding the establishment of economic and cultural relations between West Germany and the Soviet Union.

Malenkov said that the Soviet government would consider such requests in good faith, as the establishment of economic and cultural relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany is in the interests of both parties and contributes to the resolution of the German question and the consolidation of peace in Europe.

    商谈了民主德国和苏联政府所关心的一些问题
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫六月十一日接见德意志民主共和国总理奥·格罗提渥。格罗提渥总理在苏联治病和休养后，现在即将返国。
    接见时在座的有苏联部长会议副主席阿·伊·米高扬、苏联外交部副部长瓦·亚·佐林。谈话在融洽与友好的气氛中进行。
    在谈话过程中，谈到了德意志民主共和国政府和苏联政府所关心的一些问题。格罗提渥总理指出了西德日益高涨的爱国运动的情况，这种爱国运动的目的是要废除关于建立“欧洲防务集团”的条约，因为废除这些条约是恢复德国统一的条件。他指出：西德的维护民族利益的有影响的人士认为，西德的片面的经济关系是阻碍与苏联建立对西德有利的关系的障碍。在这方面，格罗提渥总理表示希望苏联政府留意地考虑西德有关人士可能提出的关于西德和苏联建立经济与文化关系的要求。
    马林科夫说：苏联政府将善意地考虑这种要求，因为苏联和西德建立经济与文化关系符合于双方的利益，并且有助于德国问题的解决和欧洲和平的巩固。
