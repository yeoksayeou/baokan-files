    Darwin's "On the Origin of Species"
    First Volume of Chinese Translation Published

    The first volume of the Chinese translation of Darwin's important work "On the Origin of Species" (translated by Zhou Jianren et al.) has been published by Sanlian Bookstore. The second and third volumes will be published successively. The first volume is the basic content of Darwin's theory. Darwin's "On the Origin of Species" is a historical milestone in the development of biological science, leading biological science into a new era. In this book, Darwin repeatedly elucidated with abundant materials that various organisms were not individually created, but changed from some kind of ancestors, and are all products of history, thus crushing the anti-scientific "special creation theory" and powerfully attacking the metaphysical worldview.

    In addition to "On the Origin of Species", Darwin's other important works will also be published successively. (Xinhua News Agency)

    达尔文著作“物种起源”
    中译本第一分册已出版
    达尔文的重要著作“物种起源”中译本第一分册（周建人等译）已由三联书店出版。第二、第三分册将陆续出版。第一分册是达尔文学说的基本内容部分。达尔文的“物种起源”在生物科学的发展中是一个历史标志，从此把生物科学引向新的时代。在这部著作中，达尔文用丰富的材料反复地阐明各种生物都不是个别创造出来的，而是从有种祖先变化过来的，都是历史的产物，从而粉碎了反科学的“特创说”的思想，有力地打击了形而上学的世界观。
    除“物种起源”外，达尔文的其他重要著作也将陆续出版。　（新华社）
