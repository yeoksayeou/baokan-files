Xinhua News Agency, Changdu, 4th: The soldiers of the road-building unit of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have been helping the Tibetan people along the Kangzang Highway with production and medical treatment, establishing a close friendship. During breaks from road construction, the soldiers reclaim wasteland for production along the highway, teach agricultural techniques to the Tibetan farmers, and give vegetable seedlings to the Tibetan people to plant. When the soldiers continue to advance with the road construction, they hand over the reclaimed land to farmers who have little or no land to cultivate without any compensation. The soldiers help Tibetan farmers repair irrigation ditches, cultivate land, sow seeds, and harvest crops. When a certain unit was constructing near Relou Village, they contributed more than a thousand workdays to build an irrigation ditch for the farmers, so that most of the land in Relou Village was no longer short of water; soldiers of the Third Company of a certain unit cultivated land for farmers on the west bank of the Nujiang River who had no livestock. The soldiers also help the Tibetan people along the highway carry water, collect firewood, tidy up the environment, and medical staff provide medical treatment for the Tibetan people at any time. Once, near a certain work area, Yangpei, a farmer from Wayao Village, had a difficult labor, and the baby died in the womb, and the mother's life was also in great danger. Zhu Rongfu, the health squad leader of a certain unit, rushed to help with the delivery after hearing about it, saving the mother's life. That night, the villagers danced around the fire according to custom to thank the medical staff for their help.

The Tibetan people also love the road-building soldiers. They actively cut grass and send charcoal to the soldiers, and also boil hot water for the soldiers to wash their faces and feet. Two pack horses of a certain unit ran to the home of herdsman Azu. Azu led the horses over a hundred miles of mountains and returned them to the unit.

    康藏公路筑路战士帮助沿线藏族人民生产
   【新华社昌都四日电】中国人民解放军西藏军区筑路部队的战士们，帮助康藏公路沿线的藏族人民生产、治病，建立了亲密的友情。战士们利用筑路空隙时间，在公路沿线开荒生产，把生产技术教给藏族农民，送蔬菜秧苗给藏族人民栽种。当战士们随着筑路工程的进展继续前进时，就把开垦的田地无代价交给无地、少地的农民耕种。战士们帮助藏族农民修水渠、耕地下种、收割庄稼，某部在热楼村旁施工时，曾用一千多个工为农民修了一条水渠，使热楼村大部分田地不再缺水；某部三连的战士为怒江西岸无牲畜的农民耕地。战士们还帮助公路沿线藏族人民背水、打柴、整理环境卫生，医务工作人员随时为藏族人民医疗疾病。有一次，某工区附近瓦窑村农民央佩的妻子难产，婴儿死在腹内，产妇的生命也非常危险，某部卫生班长祝荣福听说后，急忙赶去助产，救活了产妇。当天晚上，村里的人按照风俗，围着火跳舞感谢医务人员的帮助。
    藏族人民也热爱筑路战士，他们主动地替战士们割草、送炭火，还烧好热水给战士们洗脸洗脚，某部有两匹驮马跑到牧民阿足家里，阿足拉马翻过一百多里的大山，把马送还部队。
