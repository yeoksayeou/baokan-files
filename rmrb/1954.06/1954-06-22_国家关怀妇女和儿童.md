National Concern for Women and Children

Zhao Songqiu's Personal Experience

Zhao Songqiu, a people's representative from Heping District, Shenyang City, used to be an elementary school teacher before liberation. She lost her job simply because she didn't bribe her superiors. After liberation, she became a mother of six children. Under the cultivation and education of the Party and the People's Government, she became a people's representative and a member of the district government, managing important state affairs. Since being elected as a people's representative, she has collected many mass proposals in a short period. Every mass proposal and opinion she reflected has been valued by the leadership and most have been resolved. Due to the above personal experience, she deeply feels that our current draft constitution fully reflects the common aspirations of the people. She said: Is there any fact that can better illustrate how our motherland has opened up a broad road to a happy life for us women? Now, the draft constitution more clearly stipulates that women enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects. As a woman of New China and a glorious people's representative, I wholeheartedly welcome our draft constitution. I will definitely work with all the representatives in our representative group to mobilize and organize the masses to seriously discuss the draft constitution.

Feeling Happy from the Bottom of Their Hearts

The Zhao Shuzhen group of the cone winding workshop of the Tianjin No. 3 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory is a municipal model group. Their group of fifteen mothers has a total of twenty-six children. Some of these children are now in nurseries, some in kindergartens, and some are attending elementary schools for the children of employees. Women workers who are seven months pregnant receive care from the factory and are reassigned to lighter work. Every day, when they take the special bus for mothers and children to and from work, they feel happy from the bottom of their hearts and feel the Party and the government's infinite care for women and children. These things often become the driving force for them to actively produce. When they read the draft constitution published in the newspaper and learned that the draft constitution contained provisions on the protection of women and children, they became even more excited. The mothers enthusiastically talked about the future happiness of their children and how they should cherish this sacred right. Li Yueying said: We are not lagging behind in production, but we have not done enough in learning. We should work harder in the future. Wang Shuhua looked at the plump baby in her arms from time to time. She thought: The country takes such good care of the children. I should not only work hard in production, but also cultivate them well so that they can become useful talents for building the country in the future.

Zhao Meizhen's Gift

After receiving the draft constitution document, Zhao Meizhen, a female worker in the preparation group of the tablet room of the Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory, repeatedly read the article on equality between men and women. While reading, she thought about her miserable experiences before liberation and her happy life after liberation. She felt that she should set an example in production to respond to the country's care for women.

Early in the morning of June 16, Zhao Meizhen went to the workshop of the preparation group. She carefully checked each machine and also looked at the preparation of raw materials. She found that the prepared aspirin powder was enough for the workers in the next process to use, so she decided to use this time to produce soda and yeast. This reasonable arrangement avoided the phenomenon of idle work. After the workers went to work, they could carry out their work in an orderly and smooth manner. When the work was completed, Zhao Meizhen and everyone calculated that a total of more than two million tablets of powder were prepared in one shift that day, exceeding the original plan by one time. She said excitedly: "This is my gift to welcome the draft constitution."

Feeling Particularly Happy and Affectionate

The broad masses of women in Shanghai feel particularly happy and affectionate when they see the content of the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China. At the reading meeting, national textile labor model Zhang Xiaomei, Shanghai labor models Xiang Fengqi, and Yang Lanhua were very happy to see that the draft constitution stipulates that the People's Republic of China is led by the working class; that labor is a glorious thing; and that workers have the right to rest and labor. They said: We must learn our skills well and take the lead in completing socialist construction!

The famous elderly female worker Shi Xiaomei said: "More than twenty years ago, under the white terror, I held my child, carried weapons, and went to Pudong from Shanghai to carry out revolutionary activities. I saw countless martyrs sacrifice for the revolution. Today, the draft constitution has been promulgated. This is the result of our blood and sweat." Shen Cuizhen (wife of Zou Taofen), a women's worker who has been participating in the democratic movement, believes that the draft constitution has been carefully studied and discussed by the Drafting Committee of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Now, discussions will be organized among the people across the country to widely collect opinions. This will be a truly democratic constitution. Wu Ruo'an, the principal of Minli Girls' Middle School, who has been engaged in education for more than forty years, said: The so-called "constitution" and "provisional law" of the old China also had provisions on equality between men and women and protection of people's rights, but facts have proved that these were just empty words. She feels that educators were despised in the old society. Now, the draft constitution has clear provisions on citizens' right to education, which shows that the task undertaken by people's education workers is glorious. Movie actor Huang Zongying and Yue opera actor Fan Ruijuan also said that the draft constitution has given them great encouragement and increased their sense of responsibility for their work.

Having the Opportunity to Give Play to Their Talents

Bai Ju, a female actor in the drama troupe of the Northeast People's Art Theater, has three children, but these children are all taken care of by the state. The older children are in school, the second child is in the nursery, and the third child is cared for by a nanny, so that her artistic activities and other social activities have not been affected. The drama troupe's respect for the labor of female actors is the same as in other departments. Bai Ju won the Outstanding Performance Award for her good performance at the First Northeast Regional Drama, Music, and Dance Performance and Exchange Conference last year. When the drama troupe performed the drama "Julius Fucik," two more important roles were played by two new female actors, which gave them the opportunity to train themselves and give play to their talents. When she saw the provision in the draft constitution that "the state encourages and helps citizens engaged in scientific, educational, literary, artistic and other cultural undertakings in their creative work," she said: How excited I am when I read these sentences! I understand its meaning with my own personal experience.

Words from the Heart of a Martyr's Family Member

Ren Lantong is a 48-year-old housewife (family member of a martyr) in Beijing. She read the draft constitution again and again, and was particularly excited after reading the part about women. She said: I lived half my life in vain in the old society. My feet were bound when I was unmarried, destroying my health! My family said that girls were getting older and should no longer show their faces outside, so they did not allow me to continue my studies. When I arrived at my husband's family, I suffered endless torment and oppression from my in-laws. Our marriage was also arranged by our parents. I think freedom of marriage is completely right, and the Marriage Law is the best! I have personally suffered from the discrimination against women in society and at home in the old society. As for political and economic equality with men, I could not even dream of it.

Since liberation, we women have really turned over. The People's Government and the Democratic Women's Federation care for women everywhere and take care of us in everything. There are endless benefits. Looking at the articles clearly stated in the constitution and thinking about the beautiful prospects and happy life of our women, we are really happy and cannot close our mouths.

I am a martyr's family member. Some of the relatives of our martyrs have gloriously sacrificed for the motherland, and some are still working hard to defend the motherland. I want to take the lead with our sisters of military martyrs' families, first respond to the call of the All-China Women's Federation, study the draft constitution, and we will also carry out extensive publicity so that everyone here knows about it and puts forward opinions on the draft constitution. After the constitution is formally promulgated, we will definitely consciously abide by the constitution and fight to defend the constitution!

    国家关怀妇女和儿童
    赵松秋的切身体验
    沈阳市和平区人民代表赵松秋在解放前曾当过小学教员，只因为没给上司送礼，就失去了职业。解放后，她已是六个孩子的母亲，她在党和人民政府培养教育下，成了人民代表和区政府的委员，管理着国家大事。她自从当选为人民代表以后，在较短的时间里就搜集了很多群众提案。她反映的群众提案和意见，每一件都受到了领导方面的重视，并且大多数获得了解决。由于以上的切身体验，使她深深感到我们今天的宪法草案中，充分体现了人民共同的愿望。她说：难道还有什么事实，比这更能说明祖国是如何为我们妇女开辟了广阔的幸福生活的道路吗？现在，宪法草案中更明确地规定妇女在各方面享有同男子平等的权利。我作为一个新中国的妇女，光荣的人民代表，衷心欢迎我们的宪法草案，我一定要和我们代表小组各位代表一道，发动和组织群众，认真讨论宪法草案。
    从心眼儿里感到快乐
    国营天津第三棉纺织厂筒摇成工段赵淑珍小组，是一个市级模范小组。她们全组十五个母亲共有二十六个孩子，这些孩子现在有的在托儿所，有的在幼儿园，有的在职工子弟小学上学。女工怀孕七个月，就得到厂里照顾，改做轻便工作。每天，当她们上下班坐上专为接送母亲、儿童的汽车时，就从心眼儿里感到快乐，感到党和政府对妇女和儿童的无限关怀。这些事常常成为推动她们积极生产的动力。当她们读了报上公布的宪法草案，知道了宪法草案中有关于保护妇女和儿童的规定时，就更加兴奋。母亲们热烈地谈论起孩子们将来的幸福，谈到自己应如何珍重这个神圣的权利。李月英说：咱们在生产上是不落人后的，可是在学习上做得不够好，今后还应该努力。王淑华不时看看怀里白胖的小娃娃，她想：国家这样照顾到孩子们，自己不只应该努力生产，而且应该好好培育他们，使他们将来成为建设国家的有用人材。
    赵美贞的献礼
    北京制药厂片剂间配制组女工赵美贞在接到宪法草案的文件后，反复地念着关于男女平等的这一条文。她一边念，一边想到解放前的悲惨遭遇和解放后的幸福生活。她觉得自己应该在生产上做个榜样，来回答国家对妇女的关怀。
    六月十六日早晨天刚亮，赵美贞就走到配制组的工房里了。她仔细地检查了每一台机器，还看了看原料的准备情况。她发现配好的阿司匹灵粉足够下一工序的工人们使用，于是她就决定利用这个时间生产苏打和酵母。这个合理的安排，使窝工的现象避免了。工人上班后，可以有秩序地、顺利地进行工作。完工时，赵美贞和大家一计算，这一天一个班共配制了二百多万片药片的粉剂，超过原订计划一倍。她兴奋地说：“这就算我迎接宪法草案的献礼。”
    特别感到幸福和亲切
    上海市广大妇女看到中华人民共和国宪法草案的内容，特别感到幸福和亲切。在读报会上，全国纺织劳动模范张小妹、上海市劳动模范相凤祁、杨兰花看到宪法草案规定中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的；规定劳动是光荣的事情；规定工人有休息和劳动的权利等项目，十分高兴。她们说：我们得好好学会本领，带头完成社会主义建设才对头哩！
    著名的老年女工施小妹说：“二十多年前，我在白色恐怖下，从上海抱着小孩，带着武器到浦东去进行革命活动。我看到无数的烈士为革命而牺牲。今天，宪法草案公布了，这是我们用血与汗换来的成果。”过去一直参加民主运动的妇女工作者沈粹缜（邹韬奋夫人）认为：宪法草案经过中华人民共和国宪法起草委员会周密研究和详细讨论，现在，还要在全国人民中组织讨论，广泛收集意见，这将是一部真正民主的宪法。从事教育工作四十多年的民立女子中学校长吴若安说：旧中国的所谓“宪法”“约法”中，虽然也有男女平等、保障人民权利等条文，但事实证明，这些不过只是一纸空文。她觉得教育工作者在旧社会是被人轻视的，现在，宪法草案中对公民享受教育的权利有了明确规定，这说明人民教育工作者担负的任务是光荣的。电影演员黄宗英、越剧演员范瑞娟等也表示宪法草案带给她们莫大的鼓励，增加了她们对工作的责任感。
    有了发挥自己才能的机会
    东北人民艺术剧院话剧团女演员白居，虽然有三个孩子，但是这些孩子都受到了国家的照顾，大孩子在读书，第二个孩子在保育院，第三个孩子由保姆带领，使她的艺术活动和其他社会活动都没有受到影响。话剧团对于女演员劳动的尊重，也和其他部门一样，白居在去年东北区第一届戏剧、音乐、舞蹈观摩会演时，就因为有好成绩，获得了优秀表演奖。话剧团演出话剧“尤利乌斯·伏契克”时，有两个较重要的角色，就是由两个新的女演员担任的，这给了她们锻炼自己和发挥自己才能的机会。当她看到宪法草案上有“国家对于从事科学、教育、文学、艺术和其他文化事业的公民的创造性工作，给以鼓励和帮助”的规定时，她说：当我读到这些句子时，我是多么振奋啊！我是用我自己的切身体验来领会它的意义的。
    一个烈属的心里话
    任兰亭是北京市一个四十八岁的家庭妇女（烈属）。她把宪法草案一读再读，对于其中有关妇女的部分，读了以后特别感到兴奋。她说：我在旧社会过了半辈子冤枉的生活。我未出嫁时，裹坏了双脚，摧残了我的健康！家中说是女孩子年岁大了，不该再在外边出头露面，不让我继续求学。到了婆家，我又受尽公婆的折磨、压迫。我们的婚姻也由父母包办，我认为婚姻自由是完全应该的，婚姻法是再好没有哪！旧社会的妇女，在社会上、家庭中所受的歧视，我亲身都受过，至于在政治上、经济上和男子平等，那是连做梦也梦不到的。
    解放以后，我们妇女可是真翻身哪，人民政府，民主妇联处处关怀妇女，事事替我们操心，有说不完的好处。看看明明白白定在宪法中的条文，想一想我们妇女美丽的远景，幸福的生活，真使我们乐的合不上嘴。
    我是烈属。我们军烈属的亲人，有的已为祖国光荣牺牲，有的还正为保卫祖国努力。我要和我们军烈属妇女姊妹们带头，首先响应全国妇联的号召，学习宪法草案，我们还要进行广泛的宣传，使我们这里的人家喻户晓，提出对宪法草案的意见。在宪法正式公布以后，我们一定自觉地遵守宪法，为保卫宪法而斗争！
