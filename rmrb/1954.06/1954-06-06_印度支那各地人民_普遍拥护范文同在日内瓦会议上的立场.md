Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, June 4th: People throughout Indochina are generally and enthusiastically supporting the just position of Pham Van Dong, Deputy Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, at the Geneva Conference regarding the issue of restoring peace in Indochina.

	A Tai ethnic farmer named Cam Van Phai from An Pei province in the mountainous region of Northwest Vietnam said in a letter to the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attending the Geneva Conference that under French colonial rule, he and his parents could only make a living by working as hired laborers. President Ho Chi Minh's army liberated them and gave them their own land. He firmly trusts the delegation sent by President Ho Chi Minh and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam because everything decided by President Ho Chi Minh and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is to bring happiness and peace to the Vietnamese people.

	Educational workers in North Vietnam said in a letter to the delegation: "We fully support Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong's fair and reasonable proposal for a peaceful resolution to the Vietnam issue. Only with true independence and peace can national culture be greatly developed." More than nine hundred educational workers on the right bank of the Red River also expressed the same attitude in a telegram to the delegation.

	On May 13th, one hundred and twenty-five priests, monks, and believers representing 270,000 Catholics from provinces on the left bank of the Red River held a conference and sent a telegram to President Ho Chi Minh and the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam saying: "On behalf of all Catholic compatriots in the left bank area, we fully agree with the position of our delegation headed by Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, because it is the position and aspiration of the people of the whole country."

	Three thousand students from My Tho province in South Vietnam also telegraphed the delegation, expressing their support for the delegation's position at the Geneva Conference and hoping that Vietnam would soon restore peace so that they could study in a peaceful environment.

	Pham Van Dong's proposal has also received the same enthusiastic approval in Laos and Cambodia. On May 30th, the "Liberation Newspaper," the organ of the Lao Free National United Front, published a commentary saying: "The Lao people fully support the reasonable proposal of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam headed by Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong to seek a peaceful solution to the entire Indochina issue. Facts once again prove that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a true friend of the Lao and Cambodian people, while the real aggressors are the French colonialists driven and aided by the United States."

	On May 26th, more than 5,000 representatives from all walks of life in the liberated areas and French-occupied areas of Kampong Cham, Svay Rieng, and Prey Veng provinces in Cambodia held a mass meeting to hear a report from representatives of the Khmer Free National United Front on the Geneva Conference. When the representative reported on Pham Van Dong's proposal, everyone repeatedly responded with thunderous applause and cheers. The resolution passed by the conference stated: complete agreement with and warm support for Pham Van Dong's proposal at the Geneva Conference to restore peace in Indochina on the basis of respecting the independence, unity, and democracy of the three countries of Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos; warmly welcome the position and attitude of the Soviet and Chinese delegations at the Geneva Conference on restoring peace in Indochina; oppose the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to undermine the Geneva Conference and expand the Indochina War; oppose the stubborn attitude of the French delegation in denying the patriotic struggle of the Cambodian people and the Cambodian resistance government headed by Chairman Son Ngoc Minh; and guarantee further close unity in the Vietnam-Cambodia-Laos People's Alliance to oppose imperialist aggressors and puppet traitors and realize peace, independence, unity, and democracy.

    印度支那各地人民
    普遍拥护范文同在日内瓦会议上的立场
    【新华社北越四日电】印度支那各地人民普遍热烈拥护越南民主共和国副总理范文同在日内瓦会议上对于恢复印度支那和平问题的正义立场。
    越南西北部安沛省山区一个傣族农民锦文派在写给出席日内瓦会议的越南民主共和国代表团的信中说，在法国的殖民统治下，他和他的父母只能靠做长工过活。胡志明主席的军队解放了他们，并使他们有了自己的土地。他坚定地信任由胡志明主席和越南民主共和国派出去的代表团，因为胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府所决定的一切都是为了给越南人民带来幸福与和平。
    北越教育工作者给代表团的信中说：“我们完全支持范文同副总理的和平解决越南问题的公平合理的建议。只有真正的独立与和平，民族文化才可能大大发展。”红河右岸九百多名教育工作者给代表团的电报也表明了同样的态度。
    五月十三日，代表红河左岸各省二十七万天主教徒的一百二十五个神甫、修士和教徒等举行大会，致电胡志明主席和越南民主共和国代表团说：“我们代表左岸地区所有教民同胞，完全赞同以范文同副总理为首的我国代表团的立场，因为它就是全国人民的立场和愿望。”
    南越美萩省三千名学生也打电报给代表团，表示拥护代表团在日内瓦会议上的立场，并希望越南早日恢复和平，以使他们可以在和平环境中学习。
    范文同的建议在寮国和高棉也得到同样热烈赞同的反应。五月三十日，寮国自由民族统一战线机关报“解放报”发表评论说：“寮国人民完全拥护以范文同代理外长为首的越南民主共和国代表团的合理建议，以谋求和平解决全印度支那的问题。事实再一次证明，越南民主共和国是寮国人民和高棉人民真正的朋友，而真正的侵略者是受美国驱使和援助下的法国殖民者。”
    五月二十六日，高棉磅湛、柴桢、波萝勉三省解放区和法占区的各阶层人民的代表五千多人举行了群众大会，听取高棉自由民族统一战线的代表关于日内瓦会议的报告。代表报告到范文同建议时，大家一再报以雷动的掌声和欢呼。大会通过的决议表示：完全赞同和热烈拥护范文同在日内瓦会议上所提出的在尊重高棉、越南、寮国三个国家的独立、统一、民主的基础上恢复印度支那和平的建议；热烈欢迎苏联和中华人民共和国代表团在日内瓦会议上关于恢复印度支那和平的立场和态度；反对美帝国主义破坏日内瓦会议和扩大印度支那战争的阴谋；反对法国代表团否认高棉人民的爱国斗争和以山玉明主席为首的高棉抗战政府的顽固态度；保证在越南—高棉—寮国人民联盟中进一步紧密团结，反对帝国主义侵略者和傀儡卖国贼，实现和平、独立、统一和民主。
