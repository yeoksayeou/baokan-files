Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, May 31st: Farmers in Zhejiang Province are working intensively to prevent floods and drain waterlogged fields to strive for a bumper harvest of crops. Since early May, excessive rainfall in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou, Ningbo-Shaoxing plains, and Jinhua areas of Zhejiang Province has caused major rivers such as the Puyang River, Tiaoxi River, and Jinhua River to exceed warning water levels. Through the mobilization of farmers by local Party and government leading organs to carry out all-out rescue efforts, the major dikes have not collapsed. In Zhuji County, more than 60,000 farmers guarded and rescued the 500-plus li of the main and branch stream dikes of the Puyang River for two days and three nights, protecting the safety of the vast majority of the dikes and preventing tens of thousands of acres of farmland along the river from being flooded. The Xixian Dike on the Tiaoxi River is an important dike protecting one million acres of farmland in counties such as Hangzhou, Yuhang, and Deqing. When the water level inside this dike exceeded the warning level, responsible cadres from the relevant county Party and government led a large number of office cadres to the dangerous sections of the dike, and worked day and night with tens of thousands of farmers to guard and rescue it. More than 500 workers and 400 People's Liberation Army soldiers in Yuhang County also went to the dike to help with the rescue. After three consecutive days and nights of fighting the flood, the safety of the Xixian Dike was finally protected. During the flood prevention and rescue efforts, many heroic deeds emerged, such as Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, village cadres, and peasant activists taking the lead in jumping into deep water to block leaks or using their bodies to block gaps and stop the flood.

Currently, farmers in areas with excessive rainfall are rushing to drain waterlogged fields to rescue seedlings and harvest spring-flowering crops. Members of the Shuguang and Weiming Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives in Houguo Township, Shangyu County, are leading farmers throughout the township in launching a production competition to rush to harvest spring-flowering crops and replant seedlings. Sixty mutual aid teams in Tianyang Township, Zhenhai County, deployed 150 waterwheels to rush to drain waterlogged fields, and timely rescued the seedlings of more than 5,000 acres of paddy fields.

    浙江省农民紧张防洪排涝保护农作物
    【新华社杭州三十一日电】浙江省农民正在紧张地防洪排涝，争取农作物丰收。五月上旬以来，浙江省杭（州）嘉（兴）湖（州）宁（波）绍（兴）平原和金华等地区雨水过多，浦阳江、苕溪、金华江等主要河流都超过警戒水位，经当地党政领导机关发动农民全力抢救，主要堤防都没有溃决。诸暨县有六万多农民在浦阳江五百多里长的干支流堤线上守护抢险达两天三夜，保护了绝大部分堤防的安全和沿江几十万亩农田免受水淹。苕溪西险大塘是保护着杭县、余杭、德清等县一百万亩农田的重要堤塘，当这个堤塘内的水位超过警戒水位以上时，有关各县党政负责干部率领大批机关干部到堤塘险工地段，和几万农民一道日夜守护抢险。余杭县有五百多工人和四百多人民解放军战士也上堤帮助抢险。经过连续三天三夜和洪水搏斗，终于保护了西险大塘的安全。在防洪抢险中，出现了许多共产党员、青年团员、乡村干部和农民积极分子带头跳入深水堵塞漏洞或以身体堵住缺口、阻挡洪水的英勇事例。
    目前雨水过多地区的农民，正在突击排涝抢救秧苗和抢收春花作物。上虞县后郭乡曙光、伟明两个农业生产合作社的社员们，正带动全乡农民展开抢收春花作物和补种秧苗的生产竞赛。镇海县田央乡六十个互助组出动了一百五十部水车突击排涝，及时抢救了五千多亩稻田的秧苗。
