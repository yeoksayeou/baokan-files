Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 25th: Since the arrival of the People's Republic of China trade delegation headed by Kong Yuan in Jakarta, the calls from the Indonesian public and newspapers to abolish the "embargo" and establish close trade relations with the People's Republic of China have become increasingly loud.

    "Sin Po" wrote in an editorial that the "embargo" policy, which the United States forced upon others a few years ago, caused huge losses to Indonesia's economy. The newspaper pointed out that the "embargo" only benefits the United States, because it allows the United States to control the prices of rubber and other raw materials in Southeast Asian countries, and as a result, the United States will obtain huge profits. The newspaper concluded that now is the time to end the "embargo" policy.

    "Masyarakat Messenger" also expressed the same sentiment, calling for the establishment of broad trade relations with the People's Republic of China on a mutually beneficial basis.

    The well-known public figure Diapari published a statement in the newspaper, emphasizing that Indonesia should forever reject the "embargo" because the "embargo" hinders trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

    印尼公众和报纸
    要求发展和我国的贸易关系
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社雅加达二十五日讯：以孔原为首的中华人民共和国贸易代表团抵达雅加达后，印尼公众和报纸要求废除“禁运”、与中华人民共和国建立密切的贸易关系的呼声已愈来愈高。
    “新报”在社论中写道，几年前美国强制别人实行的“禁运”政策使印尼的经济受到了巨大的损失。报纸指出，“禁运”只对美国有利，因为这使美国可以左右东南亚国家的橡胶和其他原料的价格，结果美国就会获得大笔的利润。报纸最后写道，现在是结束“禁运”政策的时候了。
    “社会使者报”也有同样的表示，它呼吁与中华人民共和国在互利的基础上建立广泛的贸易关系。
    著名的公众领袖迪亚帕里在报上发表了一篇声明，他强调说，印尼应该永远拒绝“禁运”，因为
  “禁运”阻碍着与苏联和人民民主国家进行贸易。
