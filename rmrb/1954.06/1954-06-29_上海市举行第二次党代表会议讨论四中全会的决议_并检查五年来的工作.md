    The Second Shanghai Municipal Party Congress of the Communist Party of China was held from June 2nd to 24th. The meeting conveyed and discussed the resolutions of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session of the CPC and, in the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session, systematically reviewed the work in Shanghai over the five years since liberation.

    At the meeting, Tan Zhenlin, Third Secretary of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, conveyed the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC, and delivered a report on behalf of the East China Bureau on the inspection of its leadership of Shanghai's work. Pan Hannian, First Deputy Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, delivered a work review report on Shanghai's five years since liberation on behalf of the Municipal Committee. The delegates, after seven days of group discussions and two days of plenary discussions, fully promoted democracy, carried out criticism and self-criticism, and, through repeated study of various major principled issues, reached a consensus and improved their understanding.

    After serious discussion, the delegates unanimously supported the report made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee entrusted by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" passed by the plenary session. Everyone deeply realized that this resolution is completely correct, absolutely necessary, and very timely.

    The meeting unanimously agreed that the work in Shanghai over the five years since liberation has basically implemented the central government's guidelines and policies, the work has been successful, and the Shanghai Party organization is basically united. The meeting also seriously criticized the incorrect ideological styles such as complacency, liberalism, decentralism, and sectarianism that currently exist within the Shanghai Party organization.

He requested the delegates to educate all party members and cadres in the city based on the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session, earnestly implement the Party committee system, strengthen collective leadership, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and responsible cadres should fully promote democracy with the spirit of actively seeking criticism, and strengthen and consolidate the Party's unity and unification ideologically, and implement the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session into the Party's life and practical work.
