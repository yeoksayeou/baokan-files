　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to the Vietnam News Agency, Son Ngoc Minh, Chairman of the Khmer Resistance Government, issued a proclamation to the people of the whole country on June 19, the Independence Day of Free Khmer.

　　Chairman Son Ngoc Minh said: The establishment of the Khmer Resistance Government on June 19, 1950, was the result of the Khmer people's decades of continuous anti-aggression struggle. Now, the resistance forces have grown stronger and stronger, and the liberated areas have also rapidly expanded. Today, on behalf of the Resistance Government, I reverently remember those who heroically sacrificed themselves for the cause of national liberation; I extend my sincere condolences to the families of the martyrs and the wounded; I pay tribute to the army bravely fighting across the country, to the male and female cadres who have overcome numerous difficulties to consolidate and develop the resistance base areas, to the people of all strata who enthusiastically participate in the resistance, to the compatriots who are carrying out arduous struggles against the enemy in the enemy-occupied areas; and I express my friendly respect to the Vietnamese and Lao soldiers and civilians who are fighting bravely against the common enemy together with the Khmer people.

　　Chairman Son Ngoc Minh said: Celebrating the Independence Day of Free Khmer this year, there have been many new developments in the domestic and international situation. Domestically, the People's Liberation Army has achieved many brilliant successes, and guerrilla warfare and anti-enemy struggles on various battlefields have continued to develop; in the liberated areas, rent reduction and many other democratic reforms have been successfully carried out.

　　Chairman Son Ngoc Minh said: On the Indochina battlefield, although the French colonialists have the support of American interventionists, they have suffered one defeat after another. In particular, not long ago, the Vietnamese People's Army achieved a great victory in Dien Bien Phu, which is also a common victory for the people of the three brother countries.

　　Chairman Son Ngoc Minh pointed out: The resistance of the Khmer people and the Vietnamese and Lao people has increasingly received the sympathy and support of world opinion. At the Geneva Conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, and Vietnamese Democratic Republic Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong emphasized the importance of the growth of people's resistance forces and persistently defended the legitimate rights of the Khmer people. Their just statements greatly encouraged the Khmer people and strengthened the Khmer people's determination to strive for peace, independence, unification, and democracy.

　　Chairman Son Ngoc Minh finally called on the people of the whole country to strengthen unity, consolidate the Khmer Free National United Front and the Vietnam-Khmer-Laos People's Alliance, consolidate the liberated areas, implement the various policies of the Resistance Government, expose the conspiracy of the American interventionists to expand the war of aggression, closely coordinate with the fraternal people of Vietnam and Laos, and resolutely carry out the struggle in order to restore peace in Indochina, for the realization of peace, independence, unification and democracy.

    山玉明就自由高棉独立日发表告人民书
    【新华社讯】据越南通讯社消息：高棉抗战政府主席山玉明在六月十九日自由高棉独立日发表告全国人民书。
    山玉明主席说：一九五零年六月十九日，高棉抗战政府成立，这是高棉人民几十年来不断进行反侵略斗争的结果。现在，抗战力量已日益壮大，解放区也迅速地扩大了。今天，我代表抗战政府以崇敬的心情，追念为民族解放事业而英勇牺牲的人；向烈士和伤员的家属致亲切的慰问；向全国英勇作战的军队、向所有克服重重困难来巩固和发展抗战根据地的男女干部、向热烈参加抗战工作的各阶层人民、向在敌占区和敌人进行坚苦斗争的同胞们致敬；向正在和高棉人民一起对共同的敌人英勇作战的越南和寮国军民致友好的敬意。
    山玉明主席说：今年庆祝自由高棉独立日，国内和国际形势有了许多新的发展。在国内，人民解放军取得了许多辉煌的成就，游击战和各个战场的抗敌斗争不断地发展；在解放区，减租和其他许多民主改革工作都胜利地进行了。
    山玉明主席说：在印度支那战场上，法国殖民者虽然有美国干涉者的支持，还是接二连三地遭到失败。特别是不久以前，越南人民军在奠边府取得了很大的胜利，这也是三个兄弟国家人民的共同胜利。
    山玉明主席指出：高棉人民和越南、寮国人民的抗战已越来越多地得到世界舆论的同情和支持。在日内瓦会议上，苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫、中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来和越南民主共和国代理外交部部长范文同曾强调指出人民抗战力量增长的重要意义，坚持不懈地保卫着高棉人民的合法权利。他们所作的公正声明大大地鼓舞了高棉人民，加强了高棉人民争取和平、独立、统一和民主的决心。
    山玉明主席最后号召全国人民为了实现和平、独立、统一和民主，加强团结，巩固高棉自由民族统一战线和越南—高棉—寮国人民联盟、巩固解放区、执行抗战政府的各项政策，揭发美国干涉者的扩大侵略战争的阴谋，和越南、寮国的兄弟人民密切配合，坚决进行斗争，以恢复印度支那的和平。
