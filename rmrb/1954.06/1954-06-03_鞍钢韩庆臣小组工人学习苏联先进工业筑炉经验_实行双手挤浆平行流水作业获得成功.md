When Anshan Iron and Steel Industrial Furnace Construction Engineering Company renovated the coke ovens last year, worker Han Qingchen created an advanced method of two-handed mud-dipping parallel assembly line operation. This year, in the construction of the latest coke ovens, Han Qingchen, under the leadership of the Party and the guidance of Soviet experts, led his group to creatively study the advanced Soviet industrial furnace building method of two-handed mud extrusion parallel assembly line operation and achieved success. This industrial furnace building method of two-handed mud extrusion parallel assembly line operation, and the industrial furnace building method of two-handed mud-dipping parallel assembly line operation created by Han Qingchen last year, are both indispensable advanced methods for industrial furnace construction. The two-handed mud extrusion parallel assembly line operation is suitable for situations with many parallel bricks and thick mortar, while the two-handed mud-dipping parallel assembly line operation is suitable for situations with many special-shaped bricks and thin mortar. In industrial furnace construction, the simultaneous adoption of these two advanced methods can fully guarantee project quality and accelerate the progress of the project. For example, last year, when they were building coke ovens with many special-shaped bricks and thin mortar, they used the two-handed mud-dipping parallel assembly line operation to ensure quality, which increased work efficiency by an average of 40%. This year, when building coke ovens with many parallel bricks and thick mortar, after learning the advanced Soviet method of two-handed mud extrusion parallel assembly line operation, they ensured quality, and work efficiency increased by an average of more than 52% compared to last year.

    鞍钢韩庆臣小组工人学习苏联先进工业筑炉经验
    实行双手挤浆平行流水作业获得成功
    鞍钢工业筑炉工程公司在去年改建炼焦炉时，工人韩庆臣曾创造双手蘸浆平行流水作业先进方法，在今年建筑最新式的炼焦炉中，韩庆臣又在党的领导与苏联专家的指导下，领导他的小组创造性地学习苏联工业筑炉双手挤浆平行流水作业的先进方法，获得了成功。这种工业筑炉双手挤浆平行流水作业，与韩庆臣去年创造的工业筑炉双手蘸浆平行流水作业，同是工业筑炉不可缺少的两种先进方法。双手挤浆平行流水作业，适合于平形砖多、灰浆稠的情况，而双手蘸浆平行流水作业，则是适合于异形砖多、灰浆稀的情况。在工业筑炉上，同时采用这两种先进方法，就可以完全保证工程质量和加快工程的进度。如去年他们砌筑炼焦炉异形砖多、灰浆稀，采用双手蘸浆平行流水作业保证了质量，使工作效率平均提高百分之四十。今年砌筑炼焦炉、平形砖多、灰浆稠，学习了苏联的双手挤浆平行流水作业的先进方法后，保证了质量，工作效率又比去年平均提高了百分之五十二以上。
