    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Workers Overcome Complacency, Strive for Production
    May’s Production Plan for Major Products Completed and Exceeded Ahead of Schedule
    [This newspaper reports] Several major products of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have completed and exceeded the state production plan for May ahead of schedule. Pig iron was completed 1 hour and 16 minutes ahead of schedule, reaching 101.75%; cast pipes were completed 43 hours ahead of schedule, reaching 107.12%; and coke was completed 40 hours ahead of schedule, reaching 105.58%.
    From January to April this year, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant exceeded the production plans for major products every month. Some cadres and workers once developed a sense of complacency and paralysis, and slackened their efforts in production. In early May, two major industrial accidents occurred in succession. For example, the fracture of the main shaft of the coke pusher in the second coke oven affected the coke oven's production of 109 tons of coke. Therefore, in the first week of May, the production of major products such as pig iron, coke, and cast pipes did not meet the plan; only coke met the plan in the second week. After discovering this situation, the factory successively held expanded cadre meetings and general branch secretary joint meetings to seriously criticize the complacency and paralysis of some cadres and workers; and took active measures in production and safety to ensure the completion of the state plan. For example, the iron smelting department stipulated a unified technical guidance policy and changed the batching plan, which gradually improved the production situation; and based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, changed the cloth distribution, fixed the wind temperature, and stabilized the furnace conditions, which guaranteed production. In terms of cast pipes, a plan was formulated to improve the quality of cast pipes to reduce defective products. After the implementation of this series of measures, the three major products of cast pipes, coke, and pig iron successively completed the state production plan for May ahead of schedule on the mornings of May 30 and 31.
    In addition, the coal washing recovery rate of the coal washing workshop of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant did not meet the state plan in the first quarter. In May, through discussions on the state production plan, the workshop workers began to overcome pride and complacency, and summarized and promoted the operating method of coal washing worker Ren Jinghua, and stipulated a slag discharge system, etc. In May, the coal washing recovery rate has been significantly improved and exceeded the requirements of the state plan. According to preliminary calculations, by the end of the year, it can increase production and save 3.1 billion yuan for the country.

    石景山钢铁厂职工克服自满情绪努力生产
    五月份主要产品的生产计划提前超额完成
    【本报讯】石景山钢铁厂的几种主要产品都已提前超额完成五月份国家生产计划。生铁提前十六小时完成百分之一百零一点七五；铸管提前四十三小时完成百分之一百零七点一二；焦炭提前四十小时完成百分之一百零五点五八。
    石景山钢铁厂今年一至四月份月月超额完成主要产品生产计划，部分干部和职工一度产生自满情绪和麻痹思想，生产上松了劲。五月上旬，连续发生两次重大的工业事故，其中如第二焦炉推焦机大轴折断，就影响焦炉少生产焦炭一百零九吨。因此，五月份第一周主要产品生铁、焦炭和铸管的生产都没有完成计划；第二周只有焦炭完成了计划。该厂发现这种情况后，先后召开了扩大干部会议和总支书记联席会，严肃地批判了部分干部和职工的自满情绪和麻痹思想；并在生产和安全方面采取了积极措施，以保证完成国家计划。如在炼铁部规定了统一的技术指导方针，改变了配料计划，使生产情况逐步好转；又根据苏联专家建议，改变布料，固定风温，稳定了炉况，使生产得到保障。在铸管方面，制订了改进铸管质量的方案，以减少废品。执行这一系列的措施后，铸管、焦炭和生铁三种主要产品，先后在五月三十日和三十一日晨提前完成五月份国家生产计划。
    此外，石景山钢铁厂洗煤车间的洗煤收回率第一季度没有完成国家计划，五月份通过讨论国家生产计划，车间职工们开始克服骄傲自满情绪，并总结和推广了洗煤工人任景华的操作法，又规定了放渣制度等，五月份洗煤收回率已显著提高，并超过国家计划的要求，据初步计算，到年底可为国家增产节约三十一亿元。
