    Beijing Trains Reporters to Publicize the Draft Constitution
   [By Our Staff Reporter] The Beijing Municipal Draft Constitution Discussion Committee has officially begun training reporters throughout the city on the draft constitution, starting on the 4th.
    Following the formal establishment of the Beijing Municipal Draft Constitution Discussion Committee on the 1st, it immediately began the work of training reporters. On the afternoon of the 2nd, the office of the Beijing Municipal Draft Constitution Discussion Committee convened a joint meeting of the directors of the twenty-three branch offices citywide to discuss and stipulate the working system for each branch. At the same time, they focused on studying the plan for training reporters and made specific arrangements. Nearly four thousand reporters from across the city participating in the training began reading the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China (Preliminary Draft) and related documents on the 4th. According to the plan of the Beijing Municipal Draft Constitution Discussion Committee, the work of training reporters will conclude before June 15th. During this period, the Beijing Municipal Draft Constitution Discussion Committee will organize three to four unified reports to explain the basic spirit and main content of the draft constitution, as well as how to conduct publicity among the masses. In addition to the reporters being trained, some responsible comrades and democratic figures from municipal-level organizations and units will be invited to attend the reports. The first report meeting is scheduled to be held on the morning of the 5th at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall (postponed in case of rain). The speaker will be Zhang Youyu, Director of the Beijing Municipal Draft Constitution Discussion Committee. After each report, each branch will organize discussions and conduct trial lectures to enable each reporter to accurately and popularly publicize the constitution to the masses after the draft constitution is officially promulgated.
