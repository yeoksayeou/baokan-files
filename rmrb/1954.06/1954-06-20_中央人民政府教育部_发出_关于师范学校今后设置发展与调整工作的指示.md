In order to further improve secondary normal education and enhance the quality of elementary education, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government has issued "Instructions on the Future Establishment, Development, and Adjustment of Normal Schools." In addition to a brief description of the development and rectification of secondary normal education across the country over the past four years and the main problems currently existing, the instructions clearly and specifically define the current tasks and working principles of normal education. Elementary education is the foundation of the entire educational construction, and normal schools are the key to running elementary education well. According to the requirements of the general task of the state during the transition period, the important tasks of normal schools are how to train qualified and sufficient numbers of primary school teachers, teachers for senior classes of adult primary schools, and kindergarten educators in a planned way, and to enable in-service primary school teachers with low levels of education to receive the necessary improvement within a few years. Therefore, regarding the working principles of secondary normal education, the instructions point out that in the future, normal schools should be developed in a planned way based on the development plan and possible conditions of primary education; according to the specific conditions of various regions, the existing junior normal schools should be gradually transformed into normal schools or converted into places for the rotation training of primary school teachers, in order to gradually achieve the goal of improving the quality of primary education; in addition to normal schools, teacher training crash courses can be set up to supply primary school teachers; and preschool normal schools should be established and developed with emphasis. In order to implement the above principles, the instructions point out that various regions should take the following different measures for various types of normal schools according to specific circumstances: First, for normal schools, those with smaller scales should be expanded in a planned way, generally striving to gradually reach a scale of more than twelve classes (but not more than eighteen classes). In individual areas, if conditions are not available, the school scale can be smaller (but not less than six classes); in areas with too few schools, new schools should be added in a planned way according to possible conditions; normal schools with attached junior normal classes should reduce the enrollment of junior normal classes in a planned way and change to enrolling normal classes; art normal schools or art normal classes attached to normal schools should generally stop enrollment from 1954 and transform into normal schools or normal classes; students of the original art normal schools or art normal classes can study until graduation according to the original teaching plan. In order to enable normal schools and middle schools to achieve a single nature within two or three years, those with normal (or junior normal) schools attached to middle school classes or middle schools attached to normal (or junior normal) classes should continue to adjust; if adjustment is still difficult for a while, enrollment of one type of class can be stopped in a planned way, and the other type of class can be developed. Second, for preschool normal schools, preschool normal schools should be established in a planned and focused manner in industrial and mining areas and large cities; in general areas, preschool normal classes can be attached to normal schools with better conditions according to needs. All should enroll junior high school graduates. Third, for junior normal schools, if there is no need to train senior elementary school students as primary school teachers due to the large number of normal school graduates in various regions, or if there are few normal school graduates but a large number of junior high school graduates can be used as a source of students for teacher training crash courses, enrollment can be stopped from 1954 or 1955, and gradually transformed into normal schools, primary school teacher rotation training classes, or teacher training crash courses according to specific circumstances. However, junior normal schools still have the task of improving the current primary school teachers whose actual cultural level is below the senior elementary school graduation level and who have the potential for training, so when changing their nature, it is necessary to take prudent steps and not be too early or too hasty, so as not to affect the improvement of current primary school teachers. As for ethnic minority areas and culturally backward areas lacking primary school teachers, junior normal schools should continue to enroll students (as much as possible implement a four-year system), and if necessary, new schools may be added. Fourth, teacher training crash courses can be attached to normal schools or converted from junior normal schools, enrolling junior high school graduates for one year of professional training. Fifth, in order to gradually improve current primary school teachers and kindergarten educators, teacher rotation training classes can be held. Currently, teachers who have not reached the level of junior normal school graduation should be rotated first, so that they reach the level of junior normal school graduation (in the future, primary school teachers who have graduated from junior normal schools will be further rotated to reach the level of normal school graduation). When teachers are transferred for rotation training, primary or normal school graduates should replace the teaching work they left behind.

The instructions finally pointed out that when carrying out the establishment, development, and adjustment of normal schools in various regions, attention should be paid to: when formulating normal school development plans, enrollment plans, and adjustment plans, it is necessary to anticipate the needs of primary education development in the future, make careful calculations, and strive to ensure that the actual number of graduates from normal schools (including junior normal schools, primary school teacher rotation training classes, and teacher training crash courses) each year is roughly balanced with the number of teachers needed for the development of primary schools and senior classes of adult primary schools in the same year. Resolutely prevent blindly merging schools or closing schools. When adjusting or adding new schools, it is also necessary to take into account the certain geographical nature of the allocation of primary school teachers, and appropriately pay attention to population density and transportation conditions. The establishment and development plans of preschool normal schools should also anticipate the development of preschool education in the future. For changing junior normal schools into normal schools, it is necessary to actively create conditions and proceed in a planned and step-by-step manner. Special attention should be paid to preventing the mobility of original teachers, and teachers with training prospects should be given training and improvement as much as possible so that they can gradually take on the teaching work of normal schools.

    中央人民政府教育部
    发出“关于师范学校今后设置发展与调整工作的指示”
    为了进一步办好中等师范教育，提高初等教育的质量，中央人民政府教育部已发出“关于师范学校今后设置发展与调整工作的指示”。指示中除对四年多来全国中等师范教育的发展和整顿情况以及当前存在的主要问题作了简要说明外，对于师范教育当前的任务和工作方针作了明确具体的规定。初等教育是整个教育建设的基础，师范学校是办好初等教育的关键。根据国家过渡时期总任务的要求，今后如何做到有计划地培养合格的并有足够数量的小学教师、成人初等学校高级班师资和幼儿园的教养员，且能在若干年内，使文化程度低的在职小学教师得到应有的提高，是师范学校的重要任务。因此，关于中等师范教育的工作方针，指示中指出今后应根据小学教育的发展计划与可能条件，有计划地发展师范学校；根据各地具体情况，将现有初级师范学校逐渐转变为师范学校或改办为轮训小学教师的场所，以逐步达到提高小学教育质量的目的；小学师资的供应，除师范学校外，可另办师范速成班；幼儿师范学校应有重点地设置和发展。为了贯彻上述方针，指示指出，各地对于各类师范学校应根据具体情况，分别采取以下不同措施：第一、对师范学校，规模较小的，应有计划地扩大，一般争取逐步达到十二班以上的规模（但不宜超过十八班），个别地区如因条件不具备，学校规模可以较小
  （但不宜少于六班）；校数过少的地区，应根据可能条件有计划地增设新校；附设初级师范班的师范学校，应有计划地少招初级师范班，改招师范班；艺术师范学校或师范学校附设的艺术师范班，一般应自一九五四年起停止招生，转变为师范学校或师范班；原有艺术师范学校或艺术师范班的学生，可按原教学计划学习到毕业。为使师范和中学在二、三年内都能达到性质的单一化，凡师范（或初级师范）学校附设中学班或中学附设师范（或初级师范）班者，应继续进行调整；如一时调整尚有困难，可有计划地停招一种性质的班次，发展另一种性质的班次。第二、对幼儿师范学校，在工矿区、大城市，应有计划有重点地举办幼儿师范学校；一般地区可根据需要，选择条件较好的师范学校附设幼儿师范班。均应招收初中毕业学生。第三、对初级师范学校，各地区如因师范毕业生较多，无必要培养高小学生为小学师资者，或师范毕业生虽少，但因有大量初中毕业生可作师范速成班学生来源者，均可自一九五四年或一九五五年起停止招生，并根据具体情况，逐步转变为师范学校、小学教师轮训班或师范速成班。但初级师范学校还负有提高实际文化程度不到高小毕业水平且有培养前途的现任小学教师的任务，所以在转变其性质时，必须采取稳妥的步骤，不能过早过急，影响现任小学教师的提高。至于少数民族地区及文化落后、缺乏小学师资的地区，初级师范学校应继续招生（尽量实行四年制），如有必要并得增设新校。第四、师范速成班可在师范学校附设或由初级师范学校改办，招收初中毕业生进行一年业务训练。第五、为逐步提高现任小学教师及幼儿园教养员，可举办教师轮训班。当前首先轮训不足初级师范毕业程度的教师，使达到初级师范毕业水平（将来进一步轮训初级师范毕业程度的小学教师，达到师范学校毕业水平）。抽调教师轮训时，对其所遗留的教学工作，应以初级师范或师范毕业生顶替。
    指示最后指出，各地在进行师范学校的设置、发展和调整工作时，应注意：在制订师范学校发展计划、招生计划及调整计划时，必须预计到今后小学教育发展的需要，精打细算，力求每年师范学校
  （包括初师、小学教师轮训班、师范速成班）实有毕业人数与同一年度小学、成人初等学校高级班的发展所需增添师资人数大致平衡。切实防止盲目合并学校或停办学校。调整或增设新校时，并须照顾小学教师分配工作所具有一定的地域性，和适当注意人口密度与交通情况等条件。幼儿师范学校的设置、发展计划，并应预计到今后幼儿教育的发展。对于变初级师范学校为师范学校，必须积极地创造条件，有计划有步骤地进行。并应特别注意防止原有教师的流动，对其中有培养前途的教师，尽可能予以培养提高，使其逐渐能够担任师范学校的教学工作。（新华社）
