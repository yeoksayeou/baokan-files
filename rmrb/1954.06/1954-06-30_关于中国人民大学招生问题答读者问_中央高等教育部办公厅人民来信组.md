The People's Letters Group, General Office of the Central Higher Education Ministry

Recently, many readers have inquired about enrollment at Renmin University of China. We hereby provide a comprehensive response as follows:

	(1) Regarding enrollment methods: Due to differences in the target enrollment population, Renmin University of China, with the exception of the Department of Diplomacy and the Department of Russian Language which participate in the national unified enrollment and recruit some high school graduates, all other departments and specialties, under the guidance of the state's unified plan for cultivating advanced construction talent, only recruit on-the-job cadres and industrial workers. The university handles its own recruitment and examination matters.

	(2) Regarding the specialties and length of study at the university: The undergraduate program offers the following specialties: 1. Russian Language (participates in unified enrollment); 2.

Locations: North China: Beijing; East China: Shanghai; Central South China: Wuhan; Northeast China: Shenyang; Southwest China: Chongqing; Northwest China: Xi'an. 2. Dates: July 3rd to July 13th. Applications and examinations will be accepted upon arrival.

	(5) Regarding application procedures: 1. Applicants must have a recommendation letter from a county-level or higher-level organization, group, military unit, factory, or mine to be eligible to apply. Regardless of the recommending organization, admission is only granted upon passing the examination. 2. Submit three recent, identical, bareheaded, front-facing half-body photographs (must be from the same negative). 3.

	(7) Regarding whether on-the-job cadres who have already completed the application and registration procedures with the admissions committees of higher education institutions in various regions can apply to Renmin University of China: On-the-job cadres who have already completed the application and registration procedures with the admissions committees of higher education institutions in various regions, if they meet the application requirements of Renmin University of China and wish to apply to the university, may also apply to the admissions group of Renmin University of China. On-the-job cadres applying to Renmin University of China may also apply to other higher education institutions with the admissions committees of higher education institutions in various regions during the specified period (before July 5th). However, those who have been notified of admission by Renmin University of China cannot participate in the unified enrollment examination of other higher education institutions to avoid duplicate admissions. Those participating in the unified enrollment examination can only take the examination in their original registration area.

	(8) Regarding student benefits: 1. Industrial workers will receive 75% of their original wages; national model workers will continue to receive their full original wages. 2. Those who meet the requirements for the "transfer cadre people's scholarship" will receive the benefits of the "transfer cadre people's scholarship".

	(9) Regarding how to contact the university for application inquiries: In Beijing, you can contact the university's admissions committee directly (Address: No. 38, Dongsi Liutiao, Beijing, Telephone: 4-3186). A brochure will be sent upon request. Outside Beijing, you can inquire about the Renmin University of China admissions group through the admissions committees of higher education institutions in the major cities mentioned above.

	(10) Regarding the enrollment of the Special Training Program: The Special Training Program specializes in the rotational training of on-the-job cadres at the intermediate level (section chief level) or above. The relevant departments are responsible for selecting and assigning personnel, and there is no separate enrollment process. However, the Labor Special Training Program still recruits some students, and the procedures are the same as for the undergraduate program.
