Editor's Note: This editorial from the inaugural issue of the Soviet magazine "Party Life" expounds on the Leninist style of work – revolutionary spirit and Bolshevik practicality. The editorial profoundly criticizes the bureaucratic style of work that is divorced from the masses, opposes the leadership method of being aloof and satisfied with merely writing instructions, listening to reports, holding large meetings, and giving reports; it advocates going deep into the grassroots, deep into the masses, getting close to lively matters, directly meeting with practical workers, and attaching importance to the leadership method of doing ideological and political work among the people. "Putting vivid organizational work, guiding work, and individual mass work in the first place." These discussions have a very significant reference value for improving the work style of our party and state workers and leading various construction works in a deep and concrete manner.

The Communist Party has taken on the responsibility of drastically increasing the production of consumer goods for the people in the next two to three years. The heroic struggle of the Soviet people under the leadership of the Party to realize national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, and in the post-war period to restore and further develop the national economy, has prepared the conditions for solving this extremely crucial task.

It used to require many years of intense and constructive work to ensure that the socialist economy could transition to a new stage, that is, while the heavy industry rapidly increases, the development speed of agriculture and the industry manufacturing consumer goods can be drastically accelerated. Now there should be a leap forward in improving the lives of the working people. Therefore, the Party has set itself the recent goal: to produce abundant industrial products and grain, to build houses on a large scale, and to develop culture, so that the ever-increasing material and spiritual needs of the Soviet people can be more fully satisfied.

In the struggle to solve these new tasks, the great organizational role of the Communist Party, its infinite loyalty to the people, and its unwavering adherence to the leadership principles formulated by Lenin are once again powerfully demonstrated.

Leninism created a special style of party and state work. The characteristics of this style, as Joseph Stalin pointed out, are revolutionary spirit and Bolshevik practicality. Constantly striving to move forward, thinking boldly, setting clear goals, and being intolerant of conservatism – this is the unchanging characteristic of the great spirit of the Party's cause and the Party's revolutionary work. Having a high degree of organizational art, being good at arranging the work of tens of millions of people very appropriately, and striving to achieve the goals set – this is the manifestation of the Party's practicality.

The Leninist style was cultivated in decades of striving for the great revolutionary social transformation, that is, striving to complete the historical mission of the working class. The combination of the Communist Party's great spirit and organizational art is clearly manifested in the implementation of the program of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization.

This spirit in the current conditions is manifested in the program of various measures to develop all agricultural sectors, which was formulated by the close unity of the Party and the people. The decisions of the September Plenary Session and the February-March Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU put forward the most urgent task of increasing agricultural products, and pointed out the clear ways to increase the production of grain, meat, vegetables, potatoes, and industrial crops throughout the country. Just imagine the scale of the work of reclaiming 13 million hectares of virgin and fallow land in two years, and it will be clear how the Party is solving some problems related to improving people's consumption with revolutionary courage.

The Party is striving with great spirit to further improve social labor productivity, because this is the most important condition for the transition to communism. The broad people's movement to strive for high labor productivity is to carry out mass socialist emulation in every industrial enterprise and construction project, in the transportation sector, and in every collective farm, state farm, and agricultural machinery station.

All these very important tasks for the whole country that the Party is now solving require Party leaders and Communist Party members to work creatively and proactively, not to be complacent with the achievements they have already made, to explore all new reserve forces to accelerate our progress, and to mobilize the working people to struggle for further achievements in socialist economy and culture. Leaders who are not good at truly utilizing the potential forces of the republic, state, district, factory, and collective farm to improve the national economy cannot guarantee the completion of the tasks now facing the whole country. The former leaders of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic showed that they were very weak in their ability, they had only a narrow and limited understanding of the task of developing the republic's productive forces, they did not see or utilize the existing richest potential to rapidly develop agriculture and increase the exploitation of minerals. The Party requires all its cadres and leaders, big and small, to work with spirit and proactively. The Party supports and encourages the initiatives of local organizations, which are exploring more possibilities for reclaiming new land and increasing the production of consumer goods.

The strength of the Party lies not only in the fact that it gives the people clear goals for struggle, but also in the fact that its calls can generate great power among the masses. The Party is strong because it is good at arranging everything well. It requires its organizations to be good at practically dealing with every task, good at finding the most appropriate ways to solve this task, good at overcoming difficulties, and good at carrying out the work that has already begun to the end. The huge organizational work now being carried out to improve agriculture is a clear manifestation of the Party's practicality.

The best plan will fail if the organizational work is very weak, and the spirit will degenerate into illusory and empty fantasies if it is not combined with practicality. Some of our staff members are good at putting forward many suggestions on any issue, and from the surface, they often seem to be bold and radical. But if you look closely, you can see that these suggestions only aim at superficial effects, and they have no economic basis. For example, some agricultural leaders in Tomsk Oblast showed a lack of practical attitude, and they put forward a suggestion to uproot the trees in the large forest for reclamation, without even bothering to think about how much it would cost the state. Such "spirit" can only bring harm. It is precisely for this reason that the Party is constantly concerned with continuously improving its cadres as practical organizers, so that they can deeply understand the essence of Lenin's leadership principles.

The most important thing in organizational work is to correctly allocate cadres, to be good at selecting personnel according to their political and professional qualities, to constantly supervise how cadres actually carry out their work, and what kind of results they obtain. The 19th Party Congress acknowledged that this principle of Lenin had not been implemented satisfactorily. After the Congress, party organizations at all levels have done some work to eliminate this shortcoming, but further improving the quality of cadres and checking the work of cadres according to practical results remains the most important task in the Party's leadership practice.

The leader is primarily related to living people, he should understand people, be good at figuring out their strengths and weaknesses, and should have the knowledge, experience, and sensitivity necessary to correctly allocate forces. He must check people according to the actual results of their work, so the leader himself should be close to lively things, often contact the direct executors of a certain work, and help them in a timely manner.

When staff members forget this requirement, they are no longer true leaders. Such staff members believe that leadership is to write instructions, issue endless instructions, and prescribe every step for subordinates. If such leaders convene meetings, it is not to listen to the opinions of practitioners, discover new experiences, and collectively formulate necessary measures. For him, any meeting has only one meaning: "boosting morale" and "giving directions." If he also supervises the implementation of instructions, then what he checks is still not people, not practical results, but official documents.

The Central Committee calls on all Party and Soviet organs to carry out the most ruthless struggle against bureaucracy and procrastination. The decisions of the Central Committee of the CPSU exposed serious shortcomings in the work of Party and state organs, which are manifested in the fact that Party, Soviet, and economic cadres focus their main attention and energy not on the concrete and lively cause of organizing the working masses to struggle for the implementation of the decisions of the Party and the government, but on writing many various instructions, resolutions, certificates, letters, and reports. This harmful bureaucratic practice is contrary to Lenin's principles of organizing office work, it causes disorder, procrastination, and irresponsibility in solving extremely important issues, it makes the command headquarters huge and bloated, it separates Party and Soviet staff members from experts in the organizational work in industrial and transportation enterprises, agricultural machinery stations, and collective farms, thus causing huge damage to the entire national economy.

Clericalism and bureaucracy endanger the cause and corrupt leaders. There is a type of staff member who shirks responsibility, he believes that the most important thing is to have the necessary official documents for every life event, so that if things fail, he can say: "We have sounded the alarm" or "We have acted strictly in accordance with the instructions received." Bureaucratic leadership methods can turn staff members from active organizers into stupid bureaucrats who are accustomed to backwardness.

The work of Comrade Skvortsov, who has led the Soviet State Farm Department for many years and later served as Deputy Minister, can serve as an educational example of such a leader degenerating into a clericalist, and it can serve as a serious warning to those who are unwilling to abandon their erroneous working methods. Comrade Skvortsov is a useless organizer. Many state farms equipped with advanced technology and possessing large tracts of land made very poor use of their material strength, failed to complete their plans, and even lost money. Comrade Skvortsov bears the main responsibility for this matter.

How can agriculture be led without being detached from the land, not going to the local areas, not meeting with practical workers, and not absorbing their ideas, experiences, and suggestions? Comrade Skvortsov has not left his office for several years. He has not even been to a state farm since the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU.

What agriculture needs are combat leaders, not experts in writing reports on agricultural issues, practical organizers, not self-righteous ministers who are detached from the masses and beneficial things. Therefore, to move forward, we must get rid of those staff members who compromise with backwardness and are accustomed to shortcomings more quickly. As pointed out at the February-March Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU, Minister of Agriculture of the Soviet Union Benediktov and Minister of State Farms of the Soviet Union Kozlov should break free from the bureaucratic quagmire they have fallen into, increase the sense of responsibility of all staff members in agricultural organs from top to bottom, and shift the focus of leadership from preparing countless instructions on all issues for various regions to lively organizational work.

Serious shortcomings in the work of some staff members of the State Planning Commission are caused by being detached from actual life and taking a disdainful attitude towards the experiences and suggestions of various regions. Comrade Temidov, the former Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission, and especially Comrade Dmitriev, the former Director of the Agricultural Planning Bureau, persecuted those who raised their voices against incorrect planning. Regardless of the direct instructions of the Central Committee of the Party on giving play to the initiative of collective farms and increasing their interest in agricultural production, they adopted a bad system in planning, that is, an excessive bureaucratic centralization that suppressed local initiative.

Bureaucratic practices have also infiltrated the activities of Party organs. Often, many investigations are carried out, many meetings are held, and many various reports are collected, instead of organizing the masses to implement the decisions of the Party and the government.

Party work, by its nature, is lively mass work. Bureaucratic methods are fundamentally contrary to it. The purpose of Party work is to give play to the initiative of the working people and improve their awareness. In the struggle to improve the economy, Party organizations do not and cannot have other special tasks that are different from the tasks that the Soviet, economic organs, and social organizations are striving to achieve. In order to guide the activities of all these organizations, the Party Committee does not need to pass resolutions to repeat what has already been included in the national tasks, and there is no need to establish its own reporting system that is exactly the same as the national reporting system. It is only correct to pass a new resolution when it can truly solve some new problems and can help practical workers. If a new resolution is passed for the sake of superficial form, repeating the principles that everyone knows and that are copied from this resolution to another, that is pure bureaucracy. But it often happens that when Party Committees evaluate the merits of instructors and other staff members, they do not look at what achievements they have made in overcoming shortcomings, or whether they are good at doing mass work, but at whether they are proficient in writing reports and whether they are proficient in preparing drafts of resolutions and other documents. And when staff members are accustomed to being responsible not for things, but only for official documents, the phenomenon of irresponsibility or no one being responsible will arise.

The Communist Party requires all cadres in Party, Soviet, and economic departments to eliminate the harmful clericalism and bureaucratic leadership methods in their work, to take measures to strengthen the inspection of the implementation of Party and state decisions, and to ensure the correct selection and allocation of cadres. In order to improve the work of the organs, it is necessary to greatly reduce official documents, focus attention on organizational and political work among workers, collective farm members, intellectuals, and experts in all economic sectors, and focus on direct production activities.

Party organs should become a model for thoroughly implementing Lenin's principles of office work: helping state organs, economic organs, and social organizations bring their work closer to the masses, more widely attract working people to participate in management work, simplify organ structures and reporting systems, fight against bureaucracy and overstaffing, and improve the personal responsibility of staff members. Putting vivid organizational work, guiding work, and individual mass work in the first place.

The purpose of the reorganization of district Party organs carried out in accordance with the decisions of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU is to bring the District Committee closer to agricultural production and improve the sense of responsibility of every Party worker for specific areas. But the habit of leading in an incorrect way still exists. The February-March Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU pointed out that in some states, the reorganization of the work of the District Party Committee and the District Executive Committee is proceeding slowly and often has a formalistic nature. The level of the people who are sent to work in agricultural machinery stations and collective farms, their level of cultivation, cannot often meet the requirements. In many cases, no attention has been paid to selecting those who are well-trained, understand their tasks, are familiar with collective farm production, and love Party work to serve as district committee secretaries and instructors in agricultural machinery station areas.

Under the new conditions, the requirements for Party leaders are growing immeasurably. Therefore, it is necessary to resolutely ensure that cadres who are able to implement the Party's line, who are proactive, resourceful, tenacious, and good at organizing the masses in their work are assigned to Party work.

No matter what work a Party leader is doing, whether he is doing work in the sowing, machinery, fuel, or parts departments, he should act as an organizer of people, do a good job of coordinating people in their work, implement supervision, and provide people with assistance. Being good at working among people, loving this work, penetrating into every working person, and correctly combining economic work and political work – these are the most important qualities that every Party leader should possess.

Working among the masses means constantly improving the political education of the working people and clarifying the tasks put forward by the Party and the government. However, many Party organizations carry out political work among the masses as if they were carrying out a campaign, and they carry it out abstractly, divorced from the struggle to improve the economy. Some staff members have forgotten Lenin's instruction: the effect of political education can only be measured by economic improvement.

Work should be carried out among the masses separately, and women and young people should be more widely attracted to participate in the active struggle to improve the economy. In its congratulatory message to the 12th Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, the Central Committee of the Party put forward a task to the Youth League, which is to ensure that the Youth League members and all young people more actively participate in the construction of the state, economy, and culture, and participate in the national social and political life. The Youth League should more widely launch socialist emulation, show more initiative and proactiveness, and mobilize the strength of Soviet youth to improve labor productivity in all sectors of the national economy by all means.

Working among people is not limited to holding talks and giving reports. This work is primarily manifested in caring for people, meeting their material and spiritual needs, improving their cultural level and production skills, and making the most effective use of their talents. If the organization of people's labor is not good, and the economic and Party leaders do not care about the personal interests of the working people, then that means that no work is being done among the people, but only the most dangerous thing, that is, replacing work with talk, issuing notices, and carrying out general calls.

Some Party leaders have not yet eradicated the habit of making general speeches, and these speeches do not have a clear and well-thought-out program of action. It is very important for leaders to give speeches. If he affirms a shortcoming, then he should find out the cause of the shortcoming and point out the ways to correct it. To check a leader, we should not look at how beautiful his speech is, but at whether he correctly understands the task before him and whether he is good at achieving these tasks.

The economy cannot be led with incantations and speeches. Achievements can only be obtained by relying on economic knowledge and using the methods of material rewards that are unique to socialism, not by acting arbitrarily and interfering in the economy with administration. It is well known that because the principle of material interests of collective farms and collective farm members was violated in the development of certain agricultural sectors, the development of these sectors was greatly hindered. Similarly, it cannot be ignored how the violation of this principle has affected the practical spirit of some leaders. There are some staff members who work only with simple administrative methods, are unwilling to delve into the economy, do not study advanced labor methods, and do not study local characteristics. What they are concerned about is mainly the completion of the state procurement plan, but it is clear to anyone that it is not possible to successfully procure agricultural products without actively fighting for the development of collective farm production.

The February-March Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU put forward a task to all Party and Soviet cadres related to agricultural production, which is to master the principles of managing agriculture and understand the new methods and methods used by advanced people. Whether a worker has the spirit of practicality and the ability of creative leadership depends to a large extent on whether he is good at discovering, understanding, and promoting advanced experience. Vladimir Lenin pointed out that if under the capitalist system, the significance of individual models is extremely limited, then after the power has been transferred to the working class, "the power of the model has obtained the possibility of exerting a widespread influence for the first time in history." But the promotion of advanced experience is not spontaneous, and general speeches and calls are useless here. Experience needs to be studied, and the application of experience requires huge organizational work and mass political work, and requires the thorough elimination of everything that hinders the development of new things. However, the Party leaders in some states and districts know very little about the working conditions of the best collective farms, only know a little about the situation of the advanced collective farm producers by hearsay, and do not go to explore the working methods of these advanced people.

Not only should good experiences be studied, but shortcomings should be analyzed more deeply to find out their roots and causes. Lenin pointed out:
"It is harmful not to be tempted by what is untrue. This is the main source of our bureaucracy." We must not use praise and embellishment to avoid objective reality or avoid difficulties, but unfortunately, such things are still common in the practice of Party work. And there are also such things, the worse the situation in the district or collective farm is, the more effort is used to embellish this situation.

Our Party has always been strong because it openly criticizes shortcomings, calls mistakes mistakes straightforwardly, and calls weaknesses weaknesses. Criticism and self-criticism are the most important manifestations of Lenin's style of work. Only by critically treating the achievements that have been obtained and being intolerant of shortcomings can Party leaders take on the tasks before them, improve their work, and lead creatively.

Creative leadership is to follow the Marxist-Leninist doctrine, study daily experience, scientifically synthesize these experiences, support the buds of new things, and eliminate everything that hinders our progress. Creative leadership is only possible if the leading cadres understand the essence of the revolutionary doctrine of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and are good at using this weapon to solve practical problems.

Resolutely abiding by democratic centralism within the Party is a steadfast requirement of Lenin's style of work and the most important condition for further improving the enthusiasm of Party members and ensuring the collective leadership of the Party. The Central Committee has repeatedly pointed out that only thorough democracy within the Party can establish constant mass supervision, remove the bureaucratic tumors in our organs, and eliminate the possible phenomena of bureaucratic suppression, flattery to superiors, and forgetting the interests of the masses.

The Communist Party has openly stated its views on the issue of collective principle, and it regards the principle of collective leadership as the highest principle of Party leadership and as the necessary guarantee for correctly and smoothly solving the tasks before us. Strictly implementing this principle can educate cadres to be good at ensuring strong centralized leadership and ensuring the greatest play of the creativity of Party members and all Soviet people.

Leninism combines the following two aspects: on the one hand, it recognizes the huge role of leadership centralism, strict discipline, and organization; on the other hand, it deeply believes in the creative power of the people and is good at giving play to the initiative of the working masses. The principle of democratic centralism formulated by Lenin is not only the guiding principle of the organizational structure of the Party, but also the foundation of the entire Party work, state work, and economic work. It is precisely for this reason that Lenin attached great importance to the correct implementation of this principle, warning of the danger of turning this principle into bureaucratic centralism, which would bind the infinitely rich power of the working masses. "There is nothing more wrong than confusing democratic centralism with bureaucratic and rigid formulas. ... Centralism in the true democratic sense presupposes the following possibility created by history for the first time, that is, not only fully and unrestrictedly giving play to local characteristics, but also fully and unrestrictedly giving play to local initiative, giving play to local initiative, and giving play to the diversity of various ways, methods, and means to advance towards common goals." At the present stage of communist construction, when it is necessary to give more play to the initiative of the masses and give it the broadest activity space, it is particularly important that our cadres unswervingly implement Lenin's requirement.

In order to help local Party organizations further improve Party organizational work and Party political work, the Central Committee of the CPSU is now launching the magazine "Party Life."

The main task of this magazine is to constantly expound on the most important issues of the policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, study the pressing issues in Party construction, expound on good experiences in Party organizational work and propaganda and agitation work, and launch criticism of the shortcomings in the practical work of individual Party organizations. In the magazine's pages, questions from Party organization secretaries and propaganda and agitators will be regularly published, as well as articles reviewing books and newspapers, reviews of local Party newspapers, and answers to questions from Communist Party members. The most important condition for the broadest range of Communist Party members to actively contribute to the magazine is to enable the magazine to undertake the tasks it faces.

The strength of the Communist Party lies in the fact that it follows Lenin's legacy in all its activities and creatively enriches Leninism with new historical experiences. The strength of our Party's cadres lies in strictly abiding by Lenin's leadership principles. If Party organizations at all levels constantly improve their working methods and strengthen their ties with the masses, they will successfully complete the tasks facing the state on the road to communism.

    树立党和国家工作中的列宁式作风
    ——苏联“党的生活”杂志创刊号社论
    编者按：苏联“党的生活”杂志创刊号的这篇社论，阐述了列宁主义的工作作风——革命气魄和布尔什维克实事求是精神。社论深刻地批判了那种脱离群众的官僚主义作风，反对高高在上的满足于只是写指示、听汇报、开大会、作报告的领导方法；提倡深入基层、深入群众、接近活的事情、和实际工作者直接见面、重视在人们中间作思想政治工作的领导方法。“要把生动的组织工作，指导工作，个别进行的群众工作提到第一位”。这些论述对改进我们党和国家工作人员的工作作风、深入具体地领导各项建设工作，都有很重大的参考作用。
    共产党负起了要在最近两三年内急剧地提高人民消费品的生产的责任。苏联人民在党领导下争取实现国家工业化和农业集体化以及在战后时期争取恢复和进一步发展国民经济的英勇斗争，为解决这
  一极关重要的任务准备了条件。
    曾经需要在许多年内进行紧张的建设性的工作，以保证社会主义经济能过渡到新的阶段，即在重工业迅速增涨的同时，可以急剧地加快农业和制造人民消费品的工业的发展速度。现在应该在改善劳动人民生活方面来一个跃进了。所以党给自己提出了最近的目标：生产丰富的工业品和粮食，大规模地修建住宅和发展文化，使苏联人民不断增长的物质和精神的需求得到日益充分的满足。
    在争取解决这些新任务的斗争中，又一次强有力地表现出共产党的伟大的组织作用、它对人民的无限忠诚，它对列宁所制定的领导原则的信守不渝。
    列宁主义创造了党和国家工作的特殊作风。这一作风的特点，正像约·维·斯大林指出的，是革命的气魄和布尔什维克实事求是的精神。经常力求前进，思想大胆，目标明确，对因循守旧的现象不能容忍——这就是党的事业和党的革命工作的伟大气魄的不变的特征。具有高度的组织艺术，善于很恰当地安排成千万人的工作，努力实现所提出的目标，——这就是党的实事求是精神的表现。
    列宁主义的作风是在几十年争取伟大的革命的社会改造中，即争取完成工人阶级的历史使命中培养成的。在实现国家工业化和农业集体化的纲领中明显地表现出了共产党巨大气魄和组织艺术的结合。
    这一气魄在当前条件下是表现在党和人民紧密团结所制定的发展一切农业部门的各种措施的纲领中。苏共中央九月全会和二—三月全会的决定提出了增加农产品的最迫切的任务，指出了增加全国谷物、肉类、蔬菜、马铃薯和技术作物生产的明确途径。只要想像一下在两年内开垦一千三百万公顷生荒地和熟荒地的工作规模，就很清楚党是以何等革命的胆量解决与提高人民消费有关的一些问题。
    党以巨大的气魄争取进一步提高社会劳动生产率，因为这是向共产主义过渡的最重要条件。争取达到高度劳动生产率的广泛的人民运动，就是在每个工业企业和建筑工程，在运输部门，在每个集体农庄、国营农场和农业机器站中开展群众性的社会主义竞赛。
    党现在正解决的这一切对于全国说来是非常重大的任务，责成党的领导者和共产党员要创造性地、主动地工作，不要以既得的成绩而自满，要探求一切新的后备力量以加快我们前进的速度，要发动劳动人民为争取社会主义经济和文化进一步的成就而奋斗。领导者不善于真正地利用共和国、州、区、工厂、集体农庄的潜在力量以提高国民经济，就不能保证完成现在摆在全国面前的任务。卡查赫苏维埃社会主义共和国过去的领导者们表现了他们自己是能力很弱的，他们对发展共和国生产力的任务只是狭隘地和局限地了解，他们没有看见也没有利用现有的最丰富的潜力来迅速地发展农业和增加矿产的开采。党要求自己所有的干部和大小领导者要有气魄地、主动地工作。党支持和鼓励各地方组织的创议，它们正探寻着开垦新的土地和提高人民消费品生产的更多的可能性。
    党的力量不仅在于它给人民提出明确的斗争目标，而且在于它的号召能在群众中产生伟大的力量。党之所以强大，是因为它善于安排好任何事情。它要求自己的组织要善于实际地对待每一个任务，善于寻找解决这一任务的最适当的途径，善于克服困难并把已经开始的工作进行到底。现在在提高农业方面所展开的巨大的组织工作，是党的实事求是精神的鲜明的表现。
    只要组织工作很薄弱，最好的计划也会落空，而气魄如果不和实事求是的精神相结合，就会蜕变为虚幻和空洞的臆想。我们有些工作人员善于就任何问题提出很多建议，从表面上看来甚至常常是大胆的、急进的建议。但是仔细观察一下，就可以看出这些建议只是指望表面的效果，它们是没有任何经济根据的。例如，托姆斯克州的某些农业领导者就表现了缺乏实事求是的态度，他们提出了一个关于拔除大森林的树木以进行开垦的建议，甚至没有劳神想一想这要使国家花费多少代价。这样的“气魄”只能够带来损害。正因为如此，所以党经常关心使党的干部作为实事求是的组织者来不断地提高自己，使他们深刻地理解列宁领导原则的实质。
    组织工作中最主要的是正确地配备干部、善于按照政治和业务的品质来挑选人员、经常监督干部实际上如何进行工作以及获得什么样的效果。第十九次党代表大会曾经承认，列宁的这一原理贯彻得还不能令人满意。代表大会以后，各级党组织在消灭这个缺点上做了一定的工作，但进一步改善干部的质量和按照实际结果来检查干部的工作，仍然是党的领导实践中最重要的任务。
    领导者首先是和活的人们发生关系，他应当了解人们，善于弄清楚他们的优点和缺点，应当具有正确配备力量所必需的知识、经验和敏感。他必须按照工作的实际效果来检查人们，因而领导者本身应当接近活的事情，经常与某一工作的直接执行者取得联系，并及时地帮助他们。
    当工作人员忘了这一要求的时候，他们就不再是真正的领导者了。这样的工作人员认为领导就是写指令，发布无穷尽的指示，给下级工作人员规定每一个步骤。这样的领导者如果召集会议的话，也不是为了倾听实践者的意见，发现新的经验，集体地制定一些必要的措施。对他说来，任何会议只有一个意义：“打气”、“指示方针”。如果说他也监督指令的执行情况，那末他所检查的仍然不是人、不是实际结果，而是公文。
    中央委员会号召一切党和苏维埃机关与官僚主义和拖延作风进行最无情的斗争。在苏共中央的决定中揭发了党和国家机关工作中的严重缺点，这些缺点表现在党、苏维埃和经济干部把自己主要的注意和力量不是集中在组织劳动群众为贯彻党和政府的决定而斗争的具体生动的事业上，而是集中在缮写许多各种各样的指令、决议、证明书、信函和报告上。这种有害的官僚主义的作法是与列宁的机关工作组织原则相矛盾的，它在解决极关重要的问题上引起紊乱状态、拖延作风和不负责任的态度，它使指挥部变得庞大臃肿，使党和苏维埃的工作人员与专家脱离工业企业和运输企业、农业机器站和集体农庄中的组织工作，因而使整个国民经济遭受巨大的损害。
    文牍主义和官僚主义的作法危害着事业，并使领导者腐化。有一种推诿责任的工作人员，他认为最重要的是具备每一生活事件所必需的公文，以便事情如果失败了，他就可以说：“我们敲过警钟”或
  “我们是完全按照收到的指令办事的”。官僚主义的领导方法会使工作人员从活跃的组织者变成习惯于落后状态的愚蠢的官僚。
    多年来领导苏联国营农场部而以后又担任副部长的斯克伏尔佐夫同志的工作，就可以作为这样从领导者蜕化为文牍主义者的富有教育意义的例子，就可以作为对于那些不愿抛弃错误工作方法的人们的严重警告。斯克伏尔佐夫同志是一个毫无用处的组织者。很多用先进技术装备起来并拥有大块土地的国营农场，很糟糕地利用了自己的物质力量，没有完成计划，而且还亏了本。对于这件事情斯克伏尔佐夫同志要负主要的责任。
    脱离土地，不到地方上去，不和实际工作者会面，不吸收他们的思想、经验和建议，怎么可以领导农业呢？而斯克伏尔佐夫同志几年来没有离开过他的办公室。甚至在苏共中央九月全会以后他都没有到一个国营农场去过。
    农业所需要的是战斗的领导者，而不是写农业问题报告书的能手，是实际的组织者，而不是脱离群众和有益事情的自以为是的大臣。因此，要前进，就必须更快地摆脱那些与落后状况妥协并对缺点习以为常的工作人员。苏联农业部部长别涅吉克托夫同志和苏联国营农场部部长科兹洛夫同志应当像苏共中央二—三月全会上指出的那样，从他们陷入了的官僚主义泥坑中挣脱出来，从上到下地提高农业机关全体工作人员的责任感，把领导重心从为各个区准备关于一切问题的无数指令转移到生动的组织工作上来。
    国家计划委员会一些工作人员工作中的严重缺点，是由于脱离实际生活并对各地方的经验和建议采取轻视的态度而产生的。国家计划委员会前任副主席捷米道夫同志，尤其是农业计划局前任局长吉米特里也夫同志，对发出呼声反对不正确计划的人们进行迫害。不顾党中央委员会关于发挥集体农庄主动性和提高他们对农业生产的兴趣的直接指示，他们在计划中采用了恶劣的制度，即采用了把地方主动性压制下去的过分的官僚主义集中制。
    官僚主义的作法也渗入到党机关的活动中。往往是进行很多调查，举行很多会议，收集很多各种各样的汇报，来代替组织群众贯彻党和政府的决议。
    党的工作按其本质来说是生动的群众工作。官僚主义的方法在原则上是和它背道而驰的。党的工作的目的是发挥劳动人民的主动性，提高他们的觉悟。在争取提高经济的斗争中，党的组织没有也不可能有和苏维埃、经济机关和社会团体所努力实现的任务不同的另一些特殊的任务。为了指导所有这些组织的活动，党委会没有必要通过决议去重复国家任务中已经列入的东西，没有必要建立自己的和国家汇报制度一模一样的汇报制度。只有当新的决议真能解决一些新的问题，能对实际工作者有所帮助的时候，通过这一决议才是正确的。如果为了表面的形式通过新的决议，把大家都知道的、从这
  一决议抄入另一决议的道理重复一遍，那就是十足的官僚主义。但是常常有这样的情形，党委会在估计指导员和其他工作人员的优点时，不是看他们在克服缺点中获得什么成绩，不是看他们是否善于做群众工作，而是看他们是否熟练于写报告书，是否熟练于准备决议和其他文件的草案。而当工作人员习惯于不是对事情负责，而只是对公文负责时，即将产生不负责任的现象或无人负责的现象。
    共产党要求党、苏维埃和经济部门的全体干部要肃清对工作有害的文牍主义和官僚主义的领导方法，要采取措施加强对党和国家的决定的执行情况的检查，要保证正确地挑选和配备干部。为了改善机关工作，必须大大地减少公文，把注意力集中在工人、集体农庄庄员、知识分子和一切经济部门的专家中间的组织工作和政治工作上，集中在直接的生产活动上。
    党的机关应当成为彻底实现列宁的机关工作原则的榜样：帮助国家机关、经济机关和社会团体把它们的工作靠近群众，更加广泛地吸引劳动人民参加管理工作，把机关结构和汇报制度简单化，与官僚主义和人员冗多的现象作斗争，提高工作人员的个人责任心。要把生动的组织工作，指导工作，个别进行的群众工作提到第一位。
    按照苏共中央九月全会的决定而进行的区的党机关的改组，其目的就是使区委会接近农业生产，提高每个党的工作者对具体地区的责任心。但是以不正确的方法进行领导的习惯，仍然存在着。苏共党中央二—三月全会指出，在一些州里，区党委会和区执委会工作的改组进行得很慢，并常常带有形式主义的性质。被派到农业机器站和集体农庄去工作的人们的水平，他们的修养程度，不是常常都能满足要求的。在很多情况下，没有注意挑选那些受过很好训练、懂得自己的任务、熟习集体农庄生产和热爱党的工作的人们去作农业机器站地区的区委书记和指导员。
    在新的条件下，对党的领导者的要求是不可估量地增长着。因此，必须坚决地作到把能够执行党的路线，在工作中主动、办法多、顽强而且善于组织群众的干部去作党的工作。
    党的领导者不论是做什么工作，不论是做播种、机器、燃料、零件部门的工作，他都应当作为人们的组织者，搞好人们在工作中的协作，实行监督，并给人们以帮助。善于在人们中间进行工作，热爱这一工作，深入到每一个劳动人民，把经济工作和政治工作正确地结合起来，——这就是每个党的领导者应当具备的最重要的品质。
    在群众中进行工作，就是要不断地改善对劳动人民的政治教育，阐明党和政府所提出的任务。然而许多党的组织在群众中进行政治工作却像搞运动一样，并且抽象地进行，脱离了争取提高经济的斗争。有些工作人员忘记了列宁的这个指示：只有以经济的改善才能衡量政治教育的效果。
    应该分别地在群众中进行工作，更广泛地吸引妇女和青年参加争取提高经济的积极斗争。党的中央委员会在给苏联列宁共产主义青年团第十二次代表大会的贺词中向青年团提出了一个任务，就是要保证青年团员和全体青年更积极地参加国家、经济和文化的建设，参加全国的社会政治生活。青年团应当更广泛地展开社会主义竞赛，更多地表现积极性和主动性，动员苏联青年的力量以一切办法提高国民经济所有部门的劳动生产率。
    在人们中间进行工作，并不只限于进行谈话和作报告。这一工作首先表现在关心人们，满足他们物质上和精神上的需求，提高他们的文化水平和生产熟练程度，最有效地运用他们的才能。如果人们的劳动组织得不好，而经济和党的领导者又不关心劳动人民的个人利益，那末，这就是说，没有在人们中间进行工作，而只有最危险的事情，即用说话代替工作，发出布告和进行一般的号召。
    有一些党的领导者还没有根除作一般演讲的嗜好，这些演讲并没有明确的、经过深思熟虑的行动纲领。领导者作讲演是很重要的事情。如果他肯定了一个缺点，那就应当找出产生缺点的原因，指出改正的途径。检查一个领导者，不是看他讲话多么漂亮，而要看他是否正确地了解他面前的任务，是否善于实现这些任务。
    不能用咒语和讲演来领导经济。成绩之能获得，只有依靠经济知识，使用社会主义所特有的物质奖励的方法，而不是任所欲为，以行政来干涉经济。大家知道，由于集体农庄和集体农庄庄员的物质利益原则在某些农业部门的发展中被违反了，于是这些部门的发展便受到了很大的阻碍。同样不能不看见，这一原则之被违反是怎样影响了某些领导者的实事求是精神。有这样的工作人员，他们只以单纯的行政方法进行工作，不愿深入到经济中去，不研究先进的劳动方法，也不研究地方特点。他们所关心的主要是完成国家收购计划，可是任何人都清楚，不积极为发展集体农庄生产而斗争，是不能顺利地收购农产品的。
    苏共中央二—三月全会向一切和农业生产有关的党和苏维埃的干部提出了一个任务，就是要掌握经营农业的原则，懂得先进者所使用的新的方式和方法。一个工作者是否具备实事求是的精神和创造性的领导能力，在很大程度上要看他是否善于发现、理解和推广先进的经验。弗·伊·列宁指出，如果在资本主义制度下，个别模范的意义受到了极度的限制，那末，在政权已转到工人阶级手中之后，“模范的力量便破天荒第一次得到了发生广泛影响的可能”。但是推广先进经验不是自流的，在这里一般的讲演和号召是不起作用的。经验是需要研究的，而运用经验则需要进行巨大的组织工作和群众政治工作，需要彻底消除阻碍新事物发展的一切东西。但是，有一些州和区的党的领导者对于最好的集体农庄的工作状况了解得很少，只是道听途说地知道一点儿集体农庄生产先进者的情况，并不去探究这些先进者的工作方法。
    不仅应该研究好的经验，而且应该更深入地分析缺点，找出它们的根子和原因。列宁指出道：
  “不要使自己为不真实的东西所诱惑，这是有害的。这是我们官僚主义最主要的根源。”不能用颂扬和粉饰来回避客观现实，来回避困难，可惜这类事情在党的工作实践中还屡见不鲜。而且还有这样的事情，区里或集体农庄里的情况愈坏，就愈用力量来粉饰这一情况。
    我们的党之所以一直是强大的，就因为它公开地批评缺点，直截了当地称错误为错误，称弱点为弱点。批评和自我批评是列宁式工作作风最重要的表现。只有批判地对待已经获得的成就，对于缺点毫不容忍，党的领导者才能担任起自己面前的任务，改善自己的工作，创造性地进行领导。
    创造性的领导就是遵循马克思列宁主义学说，研究日常经验，科学地综合这些经验，扶持新事物的萌芽，铲除一切阻碍我们前进的东西。只有领导干部懂得马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林革命学说的实质，善于使用这一武器来解决实际问题，创造性的领导才有可能。
    坚决遵守党内民主制，是列宁式工作作风一定不移的要求，是进一步提高党员积极性、保证党的集体领导的最重要条件。中央不只一次地指出，只有彻底的党内民主制才能建立经常的群众监督，才能除去我们机关中的官僚主义赘瘤，才能消灭官僚主义压制、向上级阿谀逢迎和忘掉群众利益等等这些可能发生的现象。
    共产党曾公开地说出自己对集体原则这一问题的看法，它把集体领导原则看作党的领导的最高原则，看作是正确地和顺利地解决我们面前的任务所必需的保证。严格地贯彻这一原则，就能教育干部善于保证坚强的集中领导，保证党员群众和全体苏联人民创造积极性的最大发挥。
    列宁主义把下列两方面结合在一起：一方面是承认领导集中制、严格的纪律性和组织性之巨大的作用，另一方面是极深刻地相信人民的创造力量和善于发挥劳动群众的主动性。列宁所制定的民主集中制原则，不仅是党的组织构成的领导原则，而且也是整个党的工作、国家工作和经济工作的基础。正因为如此，所以列宁十分重视正确地实现这一原则，警告有把这一原则变成官僚主义集中制的危险，而官僚主义集中制会把劳动群众无限丰富的力量束缚起来。“再没有比把民主集中制同官僚主义和死板公式混为一谈更错误的了。……真正民主意义下的集中制，其前提是历史破天荒第一次所创造的下列可能性，即不仅充分无阻地发挥地方的特点，而且也充分无阻地发挥地方的倡导性，发挥地方的主动性，发挥向共同目标前进的各种途径、方法和手段的多样性”。在共产主义建设的现阶段，在必须更多地发挥群众的主动性、给它以最广阔的活动地盘的时候，特别主要的就是我们的干部要始终不渝地实现列宁的这一要求。
    为了帮助地方党组织进一步改善党的组织工作和党的政治工作，现在创办苏共中央的杂志“党的生活”。
    这一杂志的主要任务是经常阐述共产党和苏联政府政策的最重要的问题，研究党的建设中的迫切问题，阐述党的组织工作和宣传鼓动工作中好的经验，对个别党组织实际工作中的缺点展开批评。在杂志篇幅中将经常刊登党组织书记和宣传鼓动员的质疑，发表评介书报的文章、地方党的报刊的述评，以及对共产党员问题的回答。最广大范围的共产党员积极为杂志撰稿，是使杂志担负起它所面临任务的最重要条件。
    共产党的力量就在于它在自己的全部活动中遵循列宁的遗训，用新的历史经验创造性地丰富列宁主义。我们党的干部的力量就在于严格遵守列宁的领导原则。各级党组织如果经常改善自己的工作方法，加强和群众的联系，就会成功地完成国家在走向共产主义的道路上所面临的任务。
