    To build a socialist society without exploitation or poverty, where everyone can live a happy life, has been the great ideal of our country's advanced people for many years. In order to realize democracy and socialism, the Chinese people, after a long period of heroic struggle, finally overthrew the powerful domestic and foreign enemies under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and established their own People's Republic of China. Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, we have also victoriously carried out large-scale struggles such as reforming the land system, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and restoring the national economy, and have achieved a series of new victories in politics and economics. Now, socialism is not only the ideal of advanced people but also the common aspiration of the broad masses of the people. Moreover, it is no longer just a beautiful ideal but a beautiful reality being built on a large scale and in a planned way. It is gradually growing and becoming stronger, and it will gradually achieve complete victory in our country.
    Based on this reality, the People's Republic of China has formulated its own draft constitution. This draft solemnly declares that our country will gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country through peaceful means, gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; gradually eliminate exploitation and poverty, and build a prosperous and happy socialist society. Therefore, this constitution is a constitution for striving to realize a socialist society in our country, and a constitution for building a socialist society. It expresses the fundamental interests and fundamental aspirations of our people in legal form.
    To build a socialist society means to replace all non-socialist ownership with socialist ownership, so that socialist ownership will eventually become the sole ownership in our country. The draft constitution points out that in our country, in addition to the state-owned economy of socialist nature under the ownership of the whole people and the cooperative economy of laboring masses’ collective ownership and laboring masses’ partial collective ownership which are of socialist or semi-socialist nature respectively, there are also individual laborers' ownership and capitalists' ownership, all of which are completely private ownership. The draft constitution stipulates that the state protects, in accordance with the law, the individual laborers’ ownership of land, means of production and other property; at the same time, the state encourages them to gradually embark on the road of cooperation according to the principle of voluntariness, moving from laboring masses’ partial collective ownership to laboring masses' collective ownership. The state protects, in accordance with the law, the capitalists’ ownership of means of production and other property; at the same time, the state encourages capitalist industry and commerce to gradually transform into various forms of state-capitalist economy, and then gradually transform them into socialist economy under the ownership of the whole people. Gradually replacing individual laborers' ownership with laboring masses’ collective ownership, and gradually replacing capitalists' ownership with ownership by the whole people – this is the specific road for our country to eventually become a socialist society with a single socialist ownership. The analysis of various existing forms of ownership of the means of production in our country and the state's policies towards various forms of ownership constitute an important part of the general outline of the draft constitution.
    According to the provisions in the draft constitution, the socialist transformation of our national economy will be realized through peaceful means. The peaceful road is the road of combining from top to bottom and from bottom to top. Article 4 of the draft constitution stipulates: "The People's Republic of China relies on state organs and social forces... to ensure the gradual elimination of the system of exploitation and the establishment of a socialist society." This is a specific explanation of this road. Relying on state organs means that this great transformation will be carried out by state organs in accordance with the specific policies, plans and administrative measures prescribed by the state's general tasks during the transition period. The policies, plans and administrative measures of state organs are combined with the broad social forces, specifically relying on the socialist awakening of the people, relying on the people's active response, support and participation in the cause of socialist construction and transformation, and giving full play to their high creative spirit and initiative in this cause.
    The preamble to the draft constitution states that the Chinese Communist Party is the leading force of the entire people, and the general outline of the constitution stipulates that our country is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. This also indicates the basic social relations and class relations within our country. This people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance is the most important guarantee that our country can peacefully transition to a socialist society. In the past, the Party and the working class have led the people of the whole country to victory in the people's revolution, established and consolidated the state of people's democratic dictatorship, and achieved great success in the cause of restoring, developing and transforming the national economy. In the future, the leadership of the Party and the working class will ensure that our country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation will continue to develop and advance along the peaceful road until complete victory.
    The first two articles of the general outline of the draft constitution stipulate that our country is a people's democratic state, that all power of the state belongs to the people, and that all state organs shall implement democratic centralism. These articles stipulate the nature and political foundation of our country; these provisions precisely demonstrate the superiority of our people's democratic system. Article 17 of the general outline stipulates that "all state organs must rely on the masses of the people... and accept the supervision of the masses." Article 18 stipulates that "all state organ personnel must be loyal to the people's democratic system, abide by the constitution and laws, and strive to serve the people." These principles ensure that our state organs can unite all the people, and give full play to the people's enthusiasm and creativity in labor production, participation in state management, and socialist construction. Article 19 of the general outline stipulates that the state "suppresses all treasonous and counter-revolutionary activities," and Article 20 stipulates that the state's "armed forces belong to the people, and their task is to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and to defend the security of the country and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty." These provisions ensure that our people's democratic dictatorship will be increasingly consolidated in the continuous struggle against enemies at home and abroad, and ensure that our people will continue to crush all obstacles of the enemy and advance victoriously towards socialism.
    The draft constitution not only clearly stipulates the direction and path for building socialism, but also explains in the preamble the necessary conditions for our country to realize socialist construction and socialist transformation. These conditions are: internally, to unite the people of the whole country; externally, to unite with all countries and people in the world who aid and sympathize with our country and people. To unite the people of the whole country internally is what the draft constitution points out: on the one hand, to continue to consolidate the broad people's democratic united front of all democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations led by the Chinese Communist Party; on the other hand, to continue to strengthen the unity and cooperation between all nationalities in our country. To unite with all countries and people in the world who aid and sympathize with our country and people externally, according to the draft constitution, is to continuously develop and consolidate our country's friendship with the great Soviet Union and all people's democratic countries, as well as with peace-loving people all around the world.
    The preamble to the draft constitution points out: "In the great struggle to build the People's Republic of China, our people have already formed a broad people's democratic united front of all democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations led by the Chinese Communist Party." This united front has played an active role in the large-scale struggles carried out since the founding of the country, such as reforming the land system, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and restoring the national economy, as well as transforming the national economy and shifting it towards the socialist direction. In the future, this united front will, as the preamble to the draft constitution says, "continue to play its role in mobilizing and uniting the people of the whole country to complete the general task of the state during the transition period and in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad...." That is to say, it will continue to play the role of "mobilizing and uniting the people of the whole country" in our country's struggle to build socialism. Therefore, consolidating and developing our country's people's democratic united front is a necessary condition for our country to build a socialist society.
    Our country has dozens of nationalities, and these nationalities have been united into a free and equal national family under the nationality policy formulated by the Chinese Communist Party based on Marxist-Leninist theory, and new relations of friendship and cooperation among all nationalities have emerged. This new relationship of friendship and cooperation has played a significant role in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. The draft constitution points out that it is necessary to continue to strengthen the unity of all nationalities on the basis of promoting friendship and mutual assistance among all nationalities, opposing imperialism, opposing the enemies of the people within all nationalities, and opposing great-Han chauvinism and local nationalism; and stipulates that the state shall take into account the needs of all nationalities in the process of economic construction and cultural construction, and shall pay full attention to the characteristics of all nationalities in the issue of socialist transformation; it clearly stipulates that all nationalities are equal, prohibits discrimination and oppression against any nationality, and prohibits acts that undermine the unity of all nationalities; stipulates that regional autonomy shall be implemented in areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities; and has specific provisions to guarantee the rights that should be enjoyed by ethnic minorities and scattered ethnic minority people living in multi-ethnic areas. The implementation of these articles will enable all ethnic minority people living in concentrated communities, mixed communities, and scattered areas to fully enjoy the rights of equality and freedom, will make the relations between all nationalities in our country more harmonious, and will continue to strengthen the unity of all nationalities in our country. The consolidation and development of this national relationship will bring tremendous strength to the cause of consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and building socialism.
    Developing and consolidating our country's friendship with the great Soviet Union, all people's democratic countries, and peace-loving people all around the world; establishing and developing diplomatic relations based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty with any country, this is our country's consistent foreign policy, and also the future foreign policy explained in the preamble to the draft constitution. This policy not only consolidates our country's friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union and all people's democratic countries, but also establishes diplomatic relations with some other countries based on this policy, and conducts economic and cultural exchanges with many countries. The foreign policy stipulated in the draft constitution is our country's unwavering policy in international affairs for the noble purpose of world peace and human progress. It not only conforms to the requirements of our people to build their own country peacefully, but also conforms to the common aspirations of all peace-loving people in the world.

### 为建设社会主义社会而奋斗的宪法

    为建设社会主义社会而奋斗的宪法
    建设一个没有剥削、没有贫困、人人都能过幸福生活的社会主义社会，曾经是我国先进人们多年来的伟大理想。为了实现民主主义和社会主义，中国人民经过长时期的英勇奋斗，终于在中国共产党领导下打倒了强大的国内外敌人，建立了自己的中华人民共和国。中华人民共和国建立以来，又胜利地进行了改革土地制度、抗美援朝、镇压反革命分子、恢复国民经济等大规模的斗争，在政治上和经济上取得了一系列的新胜利。现在，社会主义已经不只是先进人们的理想而是广大人民的共同愿望，并且已经不只是一种美好的理想而是在大规模地有计划地建设着的美好的现实，它正在逐步成长和壮大，它将要逐步在我国取得完全的胜利。
    依据这一现实，中华人民共和国制定了自己的宪法草案。这个草案庄严地宣布：我国将通过和平的道路，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，逐步消灭剥削和贫困，建设成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。因此，这个宪法就是为争取在我国实现社会主义社会的宪法，就是建设社会主义社会的宪法。它是以法律的形式表现了我国人民的根本利益和根本愿望。
    建成社会主义社会，就是要用社会主义的所有制来代替一切非社会主义的所有制，使社会主义的所有制最终成为我国唯一的所有制。宪法草案指明，我国现在除了全民所有制的国营经济和劳动群众集体所有制、劳动群众部分集体所有制的合作社经济是分别属于社会主义或半社会主义性质的以外，还有个体劳动者所有制和资本家所有制，都是完全的私有制。宪法草案规定：国家依照法律保护个体劳动者的土地、生产资料和其他财产所有权，同时国家鼓励他们根据自愿原则逐步走上合作化的道路，经过劳动群众部分集体所有制走向劳动群众集体所有制；国家依照法律保护资本家的生产资料和其他财产所有权，同时国家鼓励资本主义工商业逐步转变成为各种不同形式的国家资本主义经济，再逐步把它们变成全民所有制的社会主义经济。以劳动群众集体所有制逐步代替个体劳动者所有制、以全民所有制逐步代替资本家所有制，这就是使我国最后变成单一的社会主义所有制的社会主义社会的具体道路。关于我国现有的各种生产资料所有制的分析以及国家对于各种所有制的政策，构成了宪法草案总纲的重要部分。
    按照宪法草案的规定，我国国民经济的社会主义改造，将通过和平的道路来实现。和平的道路，就是自上而下和自下而上相结合的道路。宪法草案第四条规定：“中华人民共和国依靠国家机关和社会力量，……保证逐步消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会。”就是这一道路的具体说明。依靠国家机关，就是说这一伟大的改造事业，将在国家机关按照国家在过渡时期的总任务所规定的具体政策、计划和行政措施之下来进行。国家机关的政策、计划和行政措施又同广大的社会力量相结合，具体地说，就是依靠人民群众的社会主义觉醒，依靠人民群众积极响应、赞助和参加社会主义建设和改造的事业，在这一事业中发挥高度的创造精神和主动精神。
    宪法草案序言中说明了中国共产党是全国人民的领导力量，宪法草案总纲中规定了我国是工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。这也表明了我国内部的基本社会关系和阶级关系。这种以工人阶级为领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，正是我国能够和平过渡到社会主义社会的最重要保证。党和工人阶级过去已经领导全国人民取得了人民革命的胜利，建立和巩固了人民民主专政的国家，并且在恢复、发展和改造国民经济的事业中取得了很大的成就。党和工人阶级的领导，今后将保证我国的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造事业通过和平的道路不断地发展前进，直到完全胜利。
    宪法草案总纲的前面两条，规定我们的国家是人民民主国家，国家的一切权力属于人民，一切国家机关一律实行民主集中制。这些条文规定了我国的国家性质和政治基础；这些规定正是表现了我国人民民主制度的优越性。总纲第十七条规定“一切国家机关必须依靠人民群众，……接受群众的监督。”第十八条规定“一切国家机关工作人员必须效忠人民民主制度，服从宪法和法律，努力为人民服务。”这些原则，保证我们国家机关能够团结全体人民，高度发挥人民群众在劳动生产中，参加国家管理中和建设社会主义中的积极性和创造性。总纲第十九条规定国家“镇压一切叛国的和反革命的活动”，第二十条规定国家的“武装力量属于人民，它的任务是保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的安全和领土主权的完整”。这些规定，保证我们的人民民主专政将在不断地反对国内外敌人的斗争中日益巩固，保证我国人民将继续粉碎敌人的一切阻挠，而胜利地向着社会主义前进。
    宪法草案不只是明确地规定了建设社会主义的方向和道路，而且在序言中说明了我国实现社会主义建设和社会主义改造的必胜条件。这些条件是：对内团结全国人民，对外联合全世界援助和同情我们的国家和人民。对内团结全国人民，这就是宪法草案中所指出的：一方面，要继续巩固以中国共产党为领导的各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体的广泛的人民民主统一战线；另一方面，要继续加强我国各民族之间的团结合作。对外联合全世界援助和同情我们的国家和人民，按照宪法草案的规定，就是要不断地发展和巩固我国同伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家以及全世界爱好和平的人民的友谊。
    宪法草案的序言指出：“我国人民在建立中华人民共和国的伟大斗争中已经结成以中国共产党为领导的各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体的广泛的人民民主统一战线。”这个统一战线在建国以来所进行的改革土地制度、抗美援朝、镇压反革命分子和恢复国民经济等大规模的斗争中，以及改造国民经济、使之向社会主义方向转变中，都曾起了积极的作用。今后，这个统一战线也将像宪法草案序言中所说的：“在动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中……继续发挥它的作用”。也就是说，它将在我国建设社会主义的斗争中，继续发挥“动员和团结全国人民”的作用。因此，巩固和发展我国的人民民主统一战线，是我国建设社会主义社会的必要条件。
    我们国家有几十个民族，这些民族已经在中国共产党根据马克思列宁主义理论所制定的民族政策之下团结成一个自由平等的民族大家庭，出现了各民族友爱合作的新关系。这种友爱合作的新关系，在巩固人民民主专政中曾经起了很大的作用。宪法草案指出要在发扬各民族间的友爱互助、反对帝国主义、反对各民族内部的人民公敌、反对大民族主义和地方民族主义的基础上，继续加强各民族的团结；并且规定国家在经济建设和文化建设的过程中要照顾各民族的需要，在社会主义改造的问题上要充分注意各民族的特点；明确规定各民族一律平等，禁止对于任何民族的歧视和压迫，禁止破坏各民族团结的行为；规定各少数民族聚居的地方实行区域自治；对于多民族杂居地区的少数民族和散居的少数民族人民，也有保障其应享的权利的具体规定。这些条文的贯彻执行，将使一切聚居、杂居和散居的少数民族人民都能充分享受平等自由的权利，将使我国各民族的关系更为融洽，将使我国各民族的团结继续加强。这种民族关系的巩固和发展，将给巩固人民民主专政和建设社会主义的事业带来巨大的力量。
    发展和巩固我国同伟大的苏联、各人民民主国家以及全世界爱好和平的人民的友谊；根据平等、互利、互相尊重领土主权的原则同任何国家建立和发展外交关系，这是我国一贯的外交政策，也是宪法草案序言中所说明的今后的外交政策。这种政策，不只巩固了我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的友好互助，而且根据这种政策，我国还和其他一些国家建立了外交关系，和许多的国家进行了经济和文化的交流。宪法草案所规定的这种外交政策，是我国在国际事务中为着世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力的坚定不移的政策。它不但符合于我国人民和平建设自己国家的要求，而且符合于全世界一切爱好和平人民的共同愿望。
