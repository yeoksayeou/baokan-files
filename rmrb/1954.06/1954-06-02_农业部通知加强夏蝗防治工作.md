The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued another notice on May 28, requiring agricultural departments in locust-affected areas to strengthen summer locust control work.

The notice pointed out: At present, summer locusts have hatched and emerged from the soil in large numbers in many areas. All regions have also begun prevention and control work. In order to completely eliminate summer locusts, protect seedlings and increase production, and lay the foundation for the prevention and control of autumn locusts, the following specific measures are proposed to strengthen summer locust control: (1) Strengthen reconnaissance and grasp the locust situation. In areas where locust eggs have not yet hatched, it is necessary to educate cadres and the masses to overcome complacency, prepare for locust control, and pay attention to grasping the hatching situation of locust eggs; in areas where locust eggs have already hatched, it is necessary to designate special personnel to regularly check the activities and growth of locust nymphs; in areas where the main force of summer locusts has been basically eliminated, it is necessary to pay attention to checking for any escaped summer locusts and monitor the activities of remnant locusts to eliminate them. (2) At the junction of locust areas, local governments should take the initiative to quickly establish joint prevention, unify the command of locust control work in adjacent areas, and ensure that summer locusts do not migrate far, take flight, or escape. (3) In areas with high densities of migratory locusts, such as Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, the dosage of pesticides can be appropriately increased in order to completely eliminate summer locusts; in areas with high densities of native locusts in Henan, Shandong, and Hebei provinces that are seriously harmful to crops, pesticide control can be the main method to reduce waste of manpower; in areas where the hatching period of summer locusts is extremely uneven, staged or secondary application of pesticides can be implemented when necessary to ensure the complete elimination of summer locusts. New locust areas, such as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Minquan County in Henan, must strengthen leadership; agricultural cadres and locust control personnel should actively learn locust control techniques. (4) In areas using aircraft for locust control, the coordination between aircraft and ground personnel should be strengthened, and a certain amount of manpower should be organized to eliminate escaped locust nymphs by spraying powder and spreading bait. (5) Due to the expansion of the area treated with pesticides this year, all regions must do a good job in technical instruction and the storage of pesticides and equipment, and strictly prevent waste of pesticides and poisoning of humans and livestock.

    农业部通知加强夏蝗防治工作
    中央人民政府农业部于五月二十八日再次发出通知，要求有蝗虫地区的农业部门加强夏蝗防治工作。
    通知中指出：目前，许多地区夏蝗已大量孵化出土。各地并都已开始进行防治工作。为了彻底消灭夏蝗，保苗增产，并为防治秋蝗奠定基础，特提出加强夏蝗防治工作的具体办法如下：（一）加强侦察，掌握蝗情。在蝗卵尚未孵化的地区，必须教育干部和群众克服麻痹思想，作好治蝗准备，并注意掌握蝗卵孵化情况；蝗卵已经孵化的地区，必须指定专人，经常检查蝗蝻活动、成长等情况；已将夏蝗主力基本上消灭了的地区，必须注意检查夏蝗漏网情况，监视残蝗活动，以消灭残蝗。（二）在蝗区交界处，当地政府应主动迅速地建立联防，统一指挥毗连地带的治蝗工作，保证不使夏蝗远迁、起飞和漏网。（三）江苏、安徽等省飞蝗密度大的地区，可适当加大用药量，以便彻底消灭夏蝗；河南、山东、河北土蝗密度很大而为害作物又较严重的地区，可以药剂除治为主，以减少人力的浪费；夏蝗孵化期极不整齐的地区，必要时可实行分期用药或二次用药，以保证将夏蝗彻底消灭。内蒙古自治区和河南民权县等新蝗区，须加强领导；农业干部和治蝗群众应积极学会治蝗技术。（四）用飞机治蝗地区，应加强飞机和地面的配合，并组织一定的人力，用喷粉、撒饵等办法，消灭漏网蝗蝻。（五）由于今年药剂治蝗面积扩大，各地必须作好技术传授和药械保管工作，严防药剂浪费和人畜中毒。
