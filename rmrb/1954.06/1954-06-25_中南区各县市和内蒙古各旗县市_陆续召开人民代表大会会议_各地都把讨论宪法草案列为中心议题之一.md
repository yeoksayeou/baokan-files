Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 23rd: The first sessions of the first People's Congress meetings in counties (cities) of the Central and Southern regions began successively on June 20th. The district People's Congress meetings in Wuhan and Guangzhou will also be held universally on the 28th and 30th respectively. These People's Congress meetings will discuss and resolve the main issues in current work based on the general task of the state during the transition period, combined with the specific conditions of the region, and elect representatives to the Provincial (Municipal) People's Congress. All representatives will also discuss the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The Jiangxi Provincial People's Government has decided to include the discussion of the draft constitution as the first item on the agenda of the county (city) People's Congress meetings. In addition to including the discussion of the draft constitution as a central topic, the Wuhan Municipal District People's Congress meetings have also decided that after the conclusion of the district People's Congress meetings, the district People's Representatives will explain the contents of the draft constitution to the voters and organize discussions.

Prior to this, 112 counties (cities) in the Central and Southern regions and one district in Wuhan had already held their first sessions of the first People's Congress meetings. Many counties (cities) that have already held meetings are preparing to continue holding the second sessions of the first People's Congress meetings in late June, at which representatives to the Provincial (Municipal) People's Congress will be elected and the draft constitution will be discussed.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, June 24th: Seventy-nine banners, counties, and cities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region held the first sessions of the first People's Congress meetings successively from late February to mid-June. The first People's Congress meetings of all leagues and administrative regions in the region, except for the Zhaowuda League which has already been held, will be held in late June or early July, focusing on discussing the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and arranging production.

The representatives attending the People's Congress meetings of each banner, county, and city are outstanding individuals elected by the broad masses of the people through universal suffrage, including all ethnic groups and strata in Inner Mongolia. According to statistics from 18 banners and counties, representatives from the worker and peasant-herdsman components account for more than 88% of all representatives. The Mongolian, Han, and other ethnic groups in various places have shown respect for the equal rights of all ethnic groups in the general election, and representatives from all ethnic groups have been elected. According to statistics from 20 banners and counties, Mongolian representatives account for more than 26% of the total number of representatives, and representatives from the Hui, Manchu, and other minority ethnic groups have also been elected according to their population ratios.

During the People's Congress meetings of each banner, county, and city, the representatives listened to and discussed reports on the general task of the state during the transition period, and believed that the realization of a socialist society is the fundamental guarantee for the happy life of all ethnic groups. The 268 representatives from the four pastoral banners living on the Hulunbuir Grassland unanimously agreed after discussion that animal husbandry is an integral part of the country's economic construction, and that they should vigorously increase livestock and improve livestock quality in the future to support the country's industrial construction and the needs of cities and rural areas for livestock products. The People's Congress meetings of each pastoral banner have made resolutions to strengthen animal husbandry production. The representatives of the People's Congresses of various agricultural banners and counties also expressed their willingness to actively develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and strive to complete and over fulfill the task of increasing agricultural production to support national construction.

The People's Congress meetings in various places also fully demonstrated the spirit of the people of all ethnic groups universally exercising democratic rights and actively managing state affairs. According to statistics from 17 banners, counties, and cities, more than 6,400 proposals were received at the meetings, most of which put forward opinions on lambing, spring plowing, developing mutual aid and cooperation, increasing production and practicing economy, and criticized the shortcomings in the work of the People's Government with a sense of ownership. The proposal review committees of the People's Congresses in various places have organized relevant departments to conduct serious research on all proposals. Important proposals have been discussed by the congress in conjunction with the central topics, and resolutions have been made and handed over to the government for implementation, truly ensuring that every case is accounted for and every item is implemented, which has satisfied the representatives and further strengthened the relationship between the Party and the government and the masses.
