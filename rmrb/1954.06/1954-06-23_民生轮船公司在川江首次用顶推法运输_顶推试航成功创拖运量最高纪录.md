The state-private joint venture Minsheng Shipping Company's Kuixia vessel successfully used the advanced Soviet transportation method – the pushing method – to push five barges on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The average push per horsepower reached 1.25 tons, setting the highest towing capacity record.

From May 13th to 21st, the Kuixia vessel used the pushing method to push two large barges (each loaded with 700 tons), one medium-sized barge (loaded with 500 tons), and two small barges (each loaded with 200 tons). Together with the Kuixia vessel's own load of 200 tons, the total load reached 2,500 tons. It successfully completed the trial run, traveling empty upstream from Yichang to Chongqing and downstream with a heavy load from Wanxian to Yichang.

Before the trial run, the Yichang Port Authority of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration and the Yichang Branch of Minsheng Shipping Company conducted technical and theoretical analyses and research on the feasibility of pushing five barges on the Sichuan River. They also organized pilots and watermen for discussions and studied the formation of the fleet. Because the fleet was balanced in terms of left and right forces, the tug and barges became a strong whole, so no cables were broken from beginning to end.

The upper reaches of the Yangtze River – the Sichuan River – have a narrow and long channel, rapid currents, and many dangerous shoals and reefs. Before liberation, general shipping required seven to eight horsepower per ton of cargo. After liberation, thanks to the efforts of the workers and the help of Soviet experts, the transportation capacity has been significantly improved. Last year's highest record was close to one ton of cargo towed per horsepower. This time, using the pushing method to push five barges, the average has reached 1.25 tons of cargo per horsepower.

    民生轮船公司在川江首次用顶推法运输
    顶推试航成功创拖运量最高纪录
    公私合营民生轮船公司夔峡轮采用了苏联先进运输法——顶推法，在长江上游顶推五驳试航成功，平均每匹马力顶推达一点二五吨，创拖运量最高纪录。
    五月十三日至二十一日，夔峡轮用顶推法，顶推大型驳船两艘（各装七百吨）、中型驳船一艘（装五百吨）、小型驳船两艘（各装二百吨），加上夔峡轮本身装二百吨，共计载重二千五百吨。从宜昌到重庆空载上驶，万县至宜昌重载下驶，试航成功，顺利完成了任务。
    试航前，长江航运管理局宜昌港务局、民生轮船公司宜昌分公司对在川江顶推五驳的可能性作了技术上和理论上的分析与研究，又组织了驾驶引水人员进行讨论，对组成船队的队形也作了研究，由于船队左右受力平衡，轮驳成为一个坚强的整体，所以自始至终未断一根缆子。
    长江上游——川江航道狭长，水流湍急，且险滩和礁石很多。解放前，一般船舶运输每吨货物需七至八匹马力。解放后，在职工们的努力和苏联专家帮助下，运输量已获得显著提高，去年最高纪录已接近每匹马力拖一吨货。这次用顶推法顶推五驳，平均每匹马力已拖到一点二五吨货。（杨振才）
