    Farmers in various parts of Hubei Province experienced continuous heavy rains in May, leading to waterlogging in some farmland. In order to strive for an all-round increase in production, farmers in the affected areas, under the leadership of local Party and government organizations, concentrated their efforts on a crash drainage program. In areas where waterlogging has been cleared, farmers are now cultivating seedlings, replanting, or rushing to harvest summer crops in the fields.
    In the crash drainage effort, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in the waterlogged areas of Hubei Province have played a leading role. In Dengba Township, Jianli County, led by three agricultural production cooperatives, more than 500 farmers were organized to build drainage ditches, and all available drainage tools were used for drainage. In just one and a half days, all the flooded farmland in the township was rescued. In Yue shan Township, Echeng County, more than 500 farmers were also organized to drain water in separate areas under the guidance of mutual aid cooperative organizations, rescuing more than 2,000 mu of farmland in two days. The Grain Department and the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Hubei Provincial People's Government have also allocated more than 2.5 million jin of late rice seeds to help many farmers overcome the difficulty of seed shortage.

    湖北省农民大力排除农田渍水
    湖北省各地五月间连降暴雨，部分农田受渍。为争取全面增产，各受渍区农民在当地党政机关领导下，集中力量突击排水。目前已经排去渍水的地方，农民正在田里育苗、补苗或抢割夏收作物。
    在突击排水中，湖北省各受渍区的农业生产合作社和互助组发挥了带头作用。监利县邓坝乡在三个农业生产合作社带动下，组织五百多个农民赶筑水沟等，并组织一切可以利用的排渍工具排水，仅一天半时间，全乡被淹农田就全部救出。鄂城县月山乡也在互助合作组织带动下，组织五百多个农民分片排水，两天内抢救农田两千多亩。湖北省人民政府粮食厅、农林厅还拨下二百五十多万斤晚谷种，帮助很多农民克服了缺种的困难。　（新华社）
