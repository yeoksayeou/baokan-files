Songjiang Province is Carrying Out Forest Regeneration and Reforestation Work

The Songjiang Province Forest Management Bureau is actively carrying out regeneration and reforestation work on forest logging sites.

Songjiang Province is one of the main forest areas in the Northeast, with logging tasks accounting for approximately one-half of the entire Northeast, resulting in a large area of forest logging sites. In order to effectively utilize the forest land area, the forestry department has specifically established forest management organizations to vigorously carry out regeneration and reforestation work. After completing preparations such as artificial seedling transplantation and forest nursery cultivation in late April, regeneration and reforestation work began in early May in areas such as Changbai Mountain and Xiaoxing'anling. According to statistics from eleven major forest areas, including Yichun, Hailin, and Dailing, as of early June, a total of 6,300 hectares of artificial seedling transplantation and more than 250 hectares of artificial direct seeding have been completed. To create conditions for future forest regeneration, 170,000 square meters of fruit tree seedlings are being cultivated in ten forest nurseries, with an estimated production of more than 27 million seedlings. Preparations are also underway to clear 2,500 hectares of forest farms, starting in late July.

In the work of regeneration in various regions, the enthusiasm of the workers has been fully utilized. Xu Guilan, a female worker at the Hailin Forest Management Station, and others actively researched and improved operational methods, adopting a two-handed soil-breaking seedling planting method, which increased work efficiency by 12% and further ensured quality.

    松江省进行森林迹地抚育更新工作
    松江省森林经营局积极开展森林采伐迹地的抚育更新工作。
    松江省是东北主要林区之一，采伐任务约占全东北的二分之一，森林迹地面积很大。为了有效地利用林野面积，林业部门专门成立了森林经营机构，以便大力进行抚育更新工作。四月下旬完成人工移苗和林间育苗等准备工作后，五月初旬便在长白山和小兴安岭等地展开抚育更新工作。根据伊春、海林、带岭等十一个主要林区六月上旬的统计，共已完成人工移苗六千三百垧，人工直播二百五十多垧。为给今后森林迹地更新创造条件，在十处林间苗圃中培育果树幼苗十七万平方公尺，预计可生产幼苗两千七百多万株。并准备在七月下旬开始清理林场两千五百垧。
    各地在迹地更新工作中，充分发挥了工人积极性。海林森林经营所女工徐桂兰等，积极钻研、改进操作方法，采用双手碎土植苗法，使工作效率提高百分之十二，并进一步保证了质量。（刘英翘）
