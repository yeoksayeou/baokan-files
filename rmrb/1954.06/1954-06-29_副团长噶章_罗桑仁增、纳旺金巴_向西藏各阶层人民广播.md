Vice Heads of the Delegation 噶章·罗桑仁增 (Gaga Zhang·Luosang Renzeng) and 纳旺金巴 (Nawang Jinba)
Broadcast to People of All Circles in Tibet

The vice heads of the Tibet National Day Observation Delegation, 噶章·罗桑仁增 (Gaga Zhang·Luosang Renzeng) and 纳旺金巴 (Nawang Jinba), broadcast to people of all circles in Tibet in Tibetan via the Central People's Broadcasting Station.

噶章·罗桑仁增 (Gaga Zhang·Luosang Renzeng) said in the broadcast: After this visit, I saw that our motherland has a vast territory, a large population, and abundant resources. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, all ethnic groups in the country are becoming increasingly united and the people's lives are becoming increasingly happy. The People's Republic of China is a big family of all our ethnic groups. In this big family, we all have equal rights and obligations. The Central People's Government helps all ethnic minorities establish autonomous regions, and the construction of all ethnic autonomous regions has greatly developed. For example, we have seen the achievements in the political, economic, and cultural construction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the good wishes and unity of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, we have confidence in the future development of the Tibetan region. With the country carrying out large-scale economic construction, the development of all ethnic minorities will be helped. However, the main force for all work and development lies in the brotherly and solid unity of all ethnic groups. As the folk saying goes: "Promote all that is good, remove all that is bad; these are the seeds that will bear rich fruit in the future."

The Communist Party's policy is formulated based on the interests of all the people. It fully takes care of the different characteristics of ethnic minorities. Because the People's Government has correctly implemented the policy of freedom of religious belief, Buddhist and other religious temples have not been destroyed. These are all facts that we have witnessed. We must have the idea of loving the country and loving the people. During our stay in Beijing and our visits, the central and local responsible leaders, cadres, and people from all walks of life gave us deep care and help, for which we are extremely grateful.

纳旺金巴 (Nawang Jinba) said in the broadcast: We came to the capital last year to participate in the National Day celebrations and felt infinitely happy. We pay our respects to the great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao gave us valuable instructions for the development of Tibet. We visited the construction of various parts of the motherland, and the leaders of various places and representatives from all walks of life warmly welcomed and saw us off. During the visits, various units sent people to guide us and give detailed explanations. In the past, the machines we used were all dependent on foreign countries. Now our factories can make their own machine tools, and the quality is very good. We also have abundant mineral resources and endless resources, which guarantee the development of economic construction. The lives of people of all ethnic groups have also improved in the past few years. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, a new look has emerged, and various construction undertakings are also developing. This is what everyone has seen with their own eyes. This is the result of correctly implementing Chairman Mao's ethnic policy. (Xinhua News Agency)

    副团长噶章·罗桑仁增、纳旺金巴
    向西藏各阶层人民广播
    西藏国庆观礼团副团长噶章·罗桑仁增、纳旺金巴在中央人民广播电台用藏语向西藏各阶层人民广播。
    噶章·罗桑仁增在广播中说：我这次参观以后，看到我们祖国土地广大，人口众多，物产丰富，在中国共产党的领导下，全国各民族日益亲密团结，人民生活日益幸福。中华人民共和国是我们各民族的大家庭，在大家庭中我们都有平等的权利和义务。中央人民政府帮助各少数民族建立自治区，各民族自治区的建设事业都有很大发展。例如内蒙古自治区、延边朝鲜族自治区的政治、经济、文化建设成就，我们都是亲眼看到的。西藏地区在中国共产党、毛主席的领导下，有了达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的善良愿望和团结，将来的发展前途，我们是具有信心的。在祖国开展大规模的经济建设情况下，各少数民族的发展是会得到帮助的。但是，一切工作发展的主要力量，在于各民族兄弟般的巩固团结。如民谚所说：“发扬一切好的，去掉一切坏的，这便是将来结下丰满果实的种子。”
    共产党的政策是依据全体人民的利益制定的。对于少数民族都根据不同特点充分照顾。由于人民政府正确实行了宗教信仰自由政策，佛教和其他宗教的寺院都没有破坏，这都是我们亲眼见的事实。我们必须有爱国爱人民的思想。我们在留京和参观期间，中央和各地负责首长、干部及各界人民给我们深厚的爱护和帮助，我们万分感激。
    纳旺金巴在广播中说：我们去年来到首都参加国庆节观礼，感觉无限的愉快。我们向伟大的领袖毛主席致敬。毛主席对我们作了西藏发展的宝贵指示。我们参观了祖国各地的建设情况，各地的负责人和各界代表都热烈欢迎欢送我们。在参观时，各单位派人引导并作详细的说明。过去我们用的机器都是依赖外国的，现在我们的工厂能自制工作母机，质量都很优越。我们还有着丰富的矿产和无尽的资源，保证了经济建设的发展。各族人民的生活几年来也得到了改善。西藏和平解放后，出现了新的面貌，各项建设事业也正在发展，这是大家亲眼看到的事。这都是正确执行毛主席民族政策的结果。（新华社）
