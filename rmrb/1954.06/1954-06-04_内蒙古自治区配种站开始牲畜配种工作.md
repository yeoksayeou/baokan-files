To improve livestock breeds and raise the quality of local large livestock such as horses and cattle, as well as to supply the agricultural production with the draft animals needed, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has established a total of thirty-one stud horse breeding stations and eight stud cattle breeding stations this year. They will use high-quality breeding stock such as Kabajin horses and Dutch cattle for breeding. These breeding stations are mainly distributed in the three leagues of Hulunbuir, Ikezhao, and Ulanqab, and the two administrative regions of Pingdiquan and Hetao. This year, the region plans to breed approximately 6,000 horses and 1,500 cattle for the masses, and a large number of high-quality hybrid foals and calves will be produced next year. Currently, the horse and cattle breeding work has begun in each breeding station.

In recent years, the People's Government has achieved certain results in improving local livestock through crossbreeding of high-quality breeding stock and local livestock. Up to now, the region has produced more than 3,000 hybrid foals and 900 hybrid calves. These hybrid foals and calves are better than local foals and calves. Taking hybrid foals as an example, their development generally exceeds the body size of local mares at the age of ten months to one year, and they are physically strong, which is very popular among farmers and herdsmen. The improved hybrid horses and hybrid cattle will not only play a significant role in supporting agricultural production, but will also provide favorable conditions for further improving local livestock.

    内蒙古自治区配种站开始牲畜配种工作
    内蒙古自治区人民政府为了改良牲畜品种，提高本地马、牛等大牲畜质量，大量供应农业生产上所需要的畜力，今年全区共设立了三十一个种马配种站，八个种牛配种站，用卡巴金马、荷兰牛等优良种畜进行配种。这些配种站，重点分布在呼伦贝尔、伊克昭、乌兰察布等三个盟和平地泉、河套两个行政区。今年全区计划给群众配马六千匹左右，配牛一千五百头，明年将生产出大批品种优良的杂种马驹和牛犊。目前各配种站已开始马、牛的配种工作。
    几年来，人民政府用优良种畜和本地牲畜杂交改良已取得了一定的成绩。到目前为止，全区已经生产了三千多匹杂种马驹，九百多头杂种牛犊。这些杂种马驹和牛犊，都比本地马驹、牛犊好。以杂种马驹为例，一般在生后十个月到一岁发育便超过本地母马的体尺，体格健壮，很受农、牧民的欢迎。经过改良的杂种马和杂种牛，不仅在支援农业生产上会发挥很大的作用，特别是为进一步改良本地牲畜提供了有利的条件。
