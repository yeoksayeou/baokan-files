Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 8th: The Geneva Conference on Indochina held its fifth plenary session on the 8th. British representative Eden chaired the meeting.

An important development at the meeting on the 8th was Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, after summarizing the discussions of the past period, offered constructive suggestions to resolve the current focal point of differing opinions – the supervision and international oversight of the implementation of the armistice agreement. He also urged the conference to promptly begin discussing a political solution.

The plenary session on the 8th was held after the restricted meeting, which began on May 17th, had convened twelve times in succession. Over the past twenty-plus days, the delegations of the nine countries have fully exchanged views on issues related to military armistice and have agreed that representatives of the two sides' commands should directly discuss the deployment of troops after the cessation of hostilities. This meeting began on June 2nd. During the process of the restricted meeting, considering that there were already many common points in the opinions of the various parties, the delegation of the People's Republic of China put forward six proposals to affirm these common points as the basis for further consultation to eliminate the remaining differences. The discussions since May 27th have been conducted according to the six proposals of the Chinese delegation. The progress of the discussion shows that the constructive efforts of the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union have been met with multiple disruptions by the US delegation and passive delays by the French delegation. Although the conference has made progress in some areas, it has encountered numerous difficulties in the supervision and enforcement of the armistice and international oversight, and has stagnated.

Speaking at the meeting on the 8th were Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Acting Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam Pham Van Dong, French Foreign Minister Bidault, British Foreign Secretary Eden, US Undersecretary of State Smith, Cambodian representative Tep Phan, and Bao Dai Vietnam Foreign Minister Nguyen Quoc Dinh.

The first to speak was French representative Bidault. Observers here pointed out that Bidault's speech was aimed less at advancing the progress of the conference than at addressing the French domestic public opinion, which urgently hopes for the restoration of peace in Indochina, and the ongoing debates in the French parliament.

Bidault attempted to "summarize" the work of the conference to date in his speech. In reality, apart from repeating some well-known common points at the conference and making a gesture of willingness to solve the problem, Bidault did not put forward any constructive suggestions that would be conducive to the progress of the conference, nor did he change his unreasonable position of constantly delaying an agreement on several important issues.

Bidault attempted to attribute the progress made by the conference to date to himself. However, everyone knows that this progress has been achieved mainly through the efforts of the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China. As for the French delegation, even Western observers cannot help but feel "surprised" by its lack of initiative at the conference. Bidault described the agreement reached by the conference to arrange meetings between representatives of the two sides' commands to study the issue of troop concentration, starting with the issue of troop concentration areas in Vietnam, in order to achieve a simultaneous ceasefire throughout Indochina as if it had been achieved through his efforts. In fact, it was the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam that proposed the principle of simultaneous and rapid ceasefire throughout Indochina, while the French delegation had repeatedly expressed its unwillingness to cease fire simultaneously. It was also the Soviet delegation, not the French delegation, that repeatedly suggested that the two sides make direct contact as soon as possible. Facts have proven that it was precisely because of the French delegation's delay that the Geneva Conference began discussing the Indochina issue only after twelve days. At the first meeting, France, posing as a "victor," put forward a one-sided and unrealistic proposal. After the discussion entered the stage of closed-door meetings, the French delegation forced the conference to first decide to deal with the issues of Cambodia and Laos and the issue of Vietnam separately before other issues could be discussed. This unreasonable demand of the French delegation plunged the conference into time-consuming and unproductive debates. These few facts alone are enough to show that the French delegation has played a role in hindering the progress of the conference on many occasions, rather than playing a role in promoting the progress of the conference.

Bidault complained that the conference had not made progress on the issues of Cambodia and Laos. However, everyone knows that the reason why these issues have not made progress is precisely because the French delegation attempted to deny the national liberation movements of the people of Cambodia and Laos, as well as their own resistance governments and armies. Bidault repeated the already refuted claim that the only problem in Cambodia and Laos was the withdrawal of the Vietnamese People's Army, which in reality does not exist in these two countries. Bidault insisted that the issue of adjusting areas only existed in Vietnam, but not in Cambodia and Laos. In fact, the resistance armies of Cambodia and Laos have liberated large swathes of territory, and the complexity of the war situation in these two countries is by no means lower than that in Vietnam. Only by demarcating the assembly areas and adjusting areas for both sides in Cambodia and Laos can the armistice in Indochina be stable and lasting.

Bidault also talked about the differences of opinion between the two sides on the issue of armistice supervision and international oversight. Bidault continued to insist on the unreasonable claim that the mixed supervisory commission should be subordinate to the neutral country supervisory commission. However, since the belligerent parties are the main body of the armistice, the mixed supervisory commission composed of the belligerent parties should naturally be responsible for implementing the armistice agreement, while the neutral country supervisory commission should be responsible for investigating violations of the armistice agreement. Bidault's argument is actually to avoid assuming the obligations as a belligerent party and to abandon its obligations to neutral countries. Bidault also expressed disagreement with the fair opinion put forward by the delegations of the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam that neutral countries should take care of the interests of both sides. On the issue of who the international oversight committee should be responsible to, he advocated "establishing and selecting an organization that the international committee can appeal to when necessary. This organization is only responsible to the participating guarantor countries." Bidault expressed his hope that the conference would continue to study the issue of international guarantees. At the same time, he hinted that he would insist on the unreasonable claim that guarantor countries could act individually.

Bidault said that he believed that there were three main issues that the conference had not yet resolved: the issues of Cambodia and Laos, the issue of demarcating assembly areas for both sides, and the specific methods of international oversight. However, Bidault did not talk about political solutions at all. Everyone knows that the restricted meeting had already decided that both military and political issues should be discussed. This omission by Bidault is by no means accidental, indicating his disregard for the national rights of the people of Indochina.

Acting Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam Pham Van Dong spoke next.

Pham Van Dong first talked about the various suggestions put forward at the meeting since the initial meetings. He pointed out that the purpose of the suggestions of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was to restore peace in Indochina through the resolution of military and political issues. This suggestion is practical, just, and reasonable. It takes into account the military and political situation in Indochina. In contrast, the suggestions of some delegations are characterized by: their suggestions are incomplete, one-sided, and even negative. Bidault's plan is purely military in nature and ignores the political aspect of the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. However, it is obvious that military and political issues are closely related. Even in military terms, this plan does not conform to the current military situation in Indochina, and therefore, it cannot lead to an agreement on a ceasefire. The Bao Dai delegation's suggestion ignores the military issue. This is a very significant fact.

Pham Van Dong pointed out that the main idea of the Bao Dai delegation's suggestion is to deny the national rights of the Vietnamese people: independence, unity, and democracy. It is based on an unacceptable foundation: to have one person represent Vietnam, and this person is Bao Dai. This is unacceptable because it does not conform to the actual situation in Vietnam, where Bao Dai has no authority, even in the areas temporarily occupied and placed under the control of his government by force; this is unacceptable because it violates the most basic concepts of rights and democracy.

Pham Van Dong said that some delegations do not want the conference to discuss the issue of peace in Indochina as a whole, and demand that the issue of Vietnam be fundamentally distinguished from the issues of Cambodia and Laos. He said that these delegations insisted that there was no armed resistance of the people against the imperialist aggressors in these countries at all. They concluded that the issue of prohibiting the transportation of troops and war materials from outside these countries does not exist at all. These facts are all intertwined and vaguely reveal the true intentions of these delegations in the issue of restoring peace in Indochina.

Pham Van Dong said that due to the great efforts of the world's peace camp, the work of the conference has made progress. The first result has been achieved. That is: the conference passed a resolution deciding to organize representatives of the two sides' commands to meet in Geneva and in Indochina to begin studying the issue of troop concentration, starting with the issue of troop concentration areas in Vietnam. However, in the performance of the other party in the meetings between the representatives of the two sides, there is nothing that can clearly show that the talks can truly lead to an agreement. And the contact in the local area in Indochina, which was clearly expected in the resolution of May 29th, has not yet been realized.

Pham Van Dong pointed out that it was precisely at such a time that France and Bao Dai signed a treaty granting so-called independence to Vietnam. The Minister of Defense of the Bao Dai government also publicly talked about the internationalization of the Indochina War. This is not an isolated and accidental phenomenon. These situations show that some people are stubbornly pursuing a policy that is not in line with the tasks assigned to the conference.

Pham Van Dong said that the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the forces of peace will continue to promote the progress of the conference. He suggested that the conference continue to discuss the six proposals on military issues put forward by the delegation of the People's Republic of China in a realistic and constructive spirit, especially the issue of ceasefire supervision and the ways to reach a satisfactory agreement. Pham Van Dong asked the French delegation to make the necessary efforts on its part so that local contacts can begin immediately.

Finally, Pham Van Dong requested that the conference enter into the discussion of political issues without delay, such as the withdrawal of foreign troops from Indochina, France's recognition of the sovereignty and true independence of Vietnam and other countries in Indochina, the organization of general elections in Vietnam, the issue of relations between Vietnam and France, namely, economic and cultural interests, and the issue of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam joining the French Union, and the conditions for joining, etc. Pham Van Dong said that he believed that these were very important and practical issues, and that they formed an inseparable part of the solution to the Indochina issue.

After Pham Van Dong spoke, Cambodian representative Tep Phan spoke. It is worth noting that this speech completely reflected the views of the US representative. Tep Phan put forward a so-called four-point proposal. The purpose of this proposal can be summarized as only one, that is, to disband the Cambodian resistance army, abolish the liberated areas, eliminate the Cambodian national liberation movement, and make the Cambodian people forever subject to the colonial rule of the United States and France. Tep Phan said that the principle of guaranteeing the cessation of reinforcements from outside Indochina cannot be applied to Cambodia. It is not difficult to see that Tep Phan's statement is precisely to enable the United States to establish military bases in Cambodia without restrictions, thereby directly threatening the stability of the Indochina armistice. Tep Phan even openly clamored to increase the puppet army of Cambodia. Obviously, this is also in line with the US policy of using Indochinese to fight Indochinese. On the issue of international supervision of the ceasefire, Tep Phan also reflected the US point of view. Echoing the US opinion, he insisted that the experience of the Korean armistice proved that neutral country supervision was ineffective. He advocated supervision by the United Nations.

Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov then spoke (full text to be issued separately).

The next speaker was British representative Eden. Eden said: The conference has made some progress, albeit slowly. He acknowledged that the divisions on the main issues remained significant.

When talking about the issue of ceasefire supervision, Eden agreed that in order to implement the armistice agreement, a mixed commission should be formed by the belligerent parties. However, Eden attempted to demean the powers of this mixed commission as "mainly technical" and "explicitly subordinate to the authority of the International Supervisory Commission." This claim is in fact a disregard for the main responsibility of the belligerent parties for the implementation of the armistice agreement, and puts the international supervisory body in a position above the belligerent parties, which is incompatible with the role of assistance and mediation of neutral countries.

Eden then proposed that the five Asian countries participating in the Colombo Conference—Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan—be the countries that make up the International Supervisory Commission.

Regarding this issue, the Soviet delegation had already proposed that India, Pakistan, Poland, and Czechoslovakia be the countries that make up the International Supervisory Commission. This suggestion was supported by the delegations of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The principle on which the Soviet, Chinese, and Democratic Republic of Vietnam delegations based their proposal was that the countries participating in the International Supervisory Commission should maintain political and diplomatic relations with the belligerent parties separately, be able to take care of the opinions and interests of both sides, so that they can fairly handle disputes between the two sides, and make the agreements reached acceptable to both sides. The suggestion put forward by Eden is clearly not in line with this principle. The above five countries do not have diplomatic relations with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

When Eden finally talked about the issue of international guarantees for peace in Indochina by the countries participating in the Geneva Conference, he attempted to deny the principle of taking collective measures through unanimous agreement among the participating guarantor countries. This opens the door wide for individual countries to interfere in Indochina affairs.

Bidault spoke next. He attempted to deny the condemnation that the French delegation was unwilling to talk about political issues, but he did not say a word about respecting the national rights of the people of Indochina. Bidault said that he also hoped that the local contact between the representatives of the two sides' commands would begin as soon as possible. However, the fact is that this contact has not yet begun due to the delay of the French side. Bidault then complained that Molotov cited Western newspapers to expose the essence of the current policies of the French authorities, but he could not deny any of the facts raised by Molotov.

Bao Dai representative Nguyen Quoc Dinh spoke next. He complained about the exposure of the Bao Dai government's unpopularity by the Soviet representative and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam representative, but he could not deny the well-known facts.

US representative Smith spoke. He also attempted to use the so-called withdrawal of the Vietnamese People's Army from Cambodia and Laos, which in fact does not exist, as an excuse to achieve the goal of eliminating the resistance forces in Cambodia and Laos. When talking about the issue of the members of the neutral country supervisory commission, Smith deliberately distorted the experience of the Korean armistice and repeated the already refuted claim at the restricted meeting, falsely accusing Poland and Czechoslovakia of not being "neutral countries." Smith said that Eden's suggestion on the issue of the members of the neutral country commission could be considered.

Molotov then said that Bidault's view that the newspaper materials he had just cited in his speech were insulting was unfounded. Molotov said: My speech was just to present some stark facts. Even if the facts are stark, they cannot be opposed.

Bidault then expressed his unwillingness to discuss this further.

Chairman Eden then announced that there were two more people on the list who requested to speak. After obtaining the consent of the representatives of the participating countries, he announced that a plenary session to discuss the Indochina issue would continue on the 9th.

    为解决印度支那停战监督和国际监察问题
    莫洛托夫提出建设性意见
    并建议迅速开始讨论印度支那政治问题
    据新华社日内瓦八日电：日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的讨论八日举行第五次全体会议。英国代表艾登担任主席。
    八日会议的重要发展是苏联外长莫洛托夫在总结了过去一个时期的讨论之后，提出了解决目前各方面意见分歧的焦点——停战协定实施的监督和国际监察问题的建设性的意见，并敦促会议迅速开始讨论政治解决问题。
    八日的全体会议是在五月十七日开始的限制性会议接连召开了十二次之后举行的。在过去的二十多天中，九国代表团已对军事停战有关问题充分地交换了意见，并已协议双方司令部代表直接会谈停止敌对行动后双方部队的部署问题，这一会谈已在六月二日开始。在限制性会议的过程中，考虑到各方面的意见已有不少共同之点，中华人民共和国代表团曾提出六点建议，以便把共同之点肯定下来，作为进一步协商消除尚存分歧的基础。从五月二十七日以来的讨论，就是按照中国代表团的六点建议进行的。讨论的进程显示：越南民主共和国、中国和苏联代表团的建设性的努力，遭到了美国代表团的多方破坏和法国代表团的消极拖延。会议虽然在某些方面获得了进展，但在停战的监督执行和国际监察问题上遇到了重重困难，停滞不前。
    在八日会议上发言的有苏联外长莫洛托夫、越南民主共和国代理外长范文同、法国外长皮杜尔、英国外相艾登、美国副国务卿史密斯、高棉王国代表泰普潘、保大越南外长阮国定。
    第一个发言的是法国代表皮杜尔。此间的观察家指出：皮杜尔的这篇发言，与其说是着眼于推进会议的进展，不如说是着眼于应付迫切希望恢复印度支那和平的法国国内舆论和正在进行辩论的法国议会。
    皮杜尔试图在他的发言中为迄今的会议工作作一“总结”。实际上，皮杜尔除了把人所共知的会议上的一些共同点重复一遍，并作出愿意解决问题的姿态以外，没有提出任何有利于会议进展的建设性建议，也没有改变他在若干重要问题上所坚持的一直拖延达成协议的无理立场。
    皮杜尔企图把会议迄今所获得的进展归功于他自己，然而，谁都知道，这些进展主要是在越南民主共和国、苏联和中国代表团的努力之下取得的。至于法国代表团，连西方观察家都不能不对它在会议上所表现的缺乏主动，感到“惊讶”。皮杜尔把会议就安排双方司令部代表会谈以便早日在印度支那全境同时实现停火所达成的协议说成好像是在他的努力之下获得的。事实上，提出在印度支那全境同时、迅速停火原则的是越南民主共和国代表团，而法国代表团却曾一再表示出不愿同时停火的倾向。多次建议双方尽早直接接触的也是苏联代表团而不是法国代表团。事实证明：正是由于法国代表团的拖延，日内瓦会议在进行了十二天以后才开始讨论印度支那问题。法国在第一次会议上又以“战胜者”自居提出了一个片面、不现实的建议。而在讨论进入秘密会议阶段以后，法国代表团又强迫会议首先决定把高棉、寮国问题和越南问题分别处理，然后才能谈其他问题。法国代表团的这种无理要求，曾经使会议陷入了费时无益的争论。仅仅这几件事实就足以说明：法国代表团在不少场合下起着阻挠会议进展的作用，而不是起着推进会议进展的作用。
    皮杜尔抱怨会议在高棉和寮国问题上没有获得进展。然而，大家知道，这些问题之所以没有获得进展，正是由于法国代表团企图否认高棉和寮国人民的民族解放运动以及他们自己的抗战政府和军队。皮杜尔重复早已被驳倒了的说法，硬说高棉和寮国的唯一问题，就是撤退实际上在这两国并不存在的越南人民军。皮杜尔硬说，调整区域的问题只在越南存在，而在高棉、寮国却不存在。事实上，高棉和寮国的抗战军队已经解放了大块国土，而且这两个国家战争形势的复杂也决不下于越南。只有在高棉、寮国划定双方集结地区和调整区域，印度支那的停战才会是稳定和持久的。
    皮杜尔还谈到了在停战监督和国际监察问题上双方意见的差异。皮杜尔继续坚持混合监督委员会应该隶属于中立国监察委员会的无理主张。然而，交战双方既然是停战的主体，由交战双方组成的混合监督委员会自然应负执行停战协定的责任，而中立国监察委员会应负调查违反停战协定的责任。皮杜尔的这种主张实际上就是避免担负作为交战一方的义务，而把自己的义务放弃给中立国。皮杜尔还表示不同意苏联、中国和越南民主共和国代表团所提中立国应照顾双方利益的公正意见。在国际监察委员会应向谁负责的问题上，他主张“设立和选择一个机构，让国际委员会在必要时能够上诉。这个机构只对参加保证各国负责”。皮杜尔表示希望会议继续研究国际保证问题。同时，他又暗示他将坚持保证国可以个别行动的无理主张。
    皮杜尔说，他认为，会议还有三个主要问题没有解决，那就是：高棉和寮国问题、划定双方集结地区问题、国际监察的具体办法问题。然而，皮杜尔却完全没有谈到政治解决问题。大家知道，限制性会议早已决定军事问题和政治问题都要讨论。皮杜尔的这个忽略决不是偶然的，这说明他漠视印度支那人民的民族权利。
    越南民主共和国代理外长范文同接着发言。
    范文同首先谈到了自从最初几次会议以后会上所提出来的各种建议。他指出，越南民主共和国的建议的目的在于通过军事和政治问题的解决来恢复印度支那的和平。这个建议是实际的、公正的和合理的。它考虑到了印度支那的军事和政治形势。相反地，某些代表团的建议的特点是：他们的建议是不完备的、片面的而且甚至是消极的。皮杜尔的计划是纯军事性质的，忽略了恢复印度支那和平问题的政治方面。然而，很明显的，军事问题和政治问题是有密切联系的。即使在军事方面，这个计划也是不符合于目前印度支那的军事形势的，因此，它不能导向停火的协定。保大代表团的建议忽略了军事问题。这是很有意义的事实。
    范文同指出，保大代表团的建议的主要思想是否认越南人民的民族权利：独立、统一和民主。它所根据的是这样一个不可接受的基础：由一个人来代表越南，这个人就是保大。这一点之所以不可接受是因为它是不符合越南的实际情况的。在那里保大没有任何权威，甚至是在暂时被占领的和用武力置于他的政府控制下的地区；这一点之所以不可接受是因为它违反了权利和民主的最基本的概念。
    范文同说，某些代表团不希望会议把印度支那和平问题当作一个整体来讨论，要求把越南问题和高棉、寮国问题加以根本的区别。他说，这些代表团硬说在这些国家内，根本没有人民对帝国主义侵略者的武装抵抗。它们得出结论说，禁止从境外把军队和作战物资运入这些国家的问题根本不存在。这些事实都互相搀杂着，并且隐约地显示了这些代表团在恢复印度支那和平问题上的真正意图。
    范文同说，由于世界和平阵营的巨大努力，会议的工作取得了进展。已经取得了第一个结果。这就是：会议通过了决议，决定组织双方司令部的代表在日内瓦以及在印度支那会谈，以便从越南的军队集结地区问题开始，着手研究军队的集结问题。但是，在双方代表的会面当中，对方的表现中毫没有能使人明确地看到会谈能够真正地导致协议的东西。而五月二十九日的决议中所明确地预期的在印度支那当地的接触，至今还没有见诸实现。
    范文同指出，正是在这样一个时候，法国和保大签署了一项给越南所谓独立的条约。保大政府的国防部长也公开谈论印度支那战争的国际化。这并不是孤立的偶然的现象。这些情况说明了有人固执地奉行一个政策，这是和赋予会议的任务不相符合的。
    范文同说，越南民主共和国代表团相信，和平力量将继续促使会议取得进展。他建议会议以现实的和建设性的精神继续讨论中华人民共和国代表团提出的关于军事问题的六点建议，特别是停火的监督和获致圆满协议的途径问题。范文同请法国代表团在它那一方面作必要的努力，以便当地的接触可以立即开始。
    最后，范文同要求会议毫不延迟地进入政治问题的讨论，诸如外国军队自印度支那撤退问题、法国承认越南和印度支那其他国家的主权和真正独立问题、在越南组织普选问题、越南和法国的关系问题，即经济与文化利益问题以及关于越南民主共和国加入法兰西联邦以及加入的条件的问题等等。范文同说，他认为这些都是很重要而实际的问题，它们形成了印度支那问题的解决的不可分的一部分。
    在范文同发言之后，高棉王国代表泰普潘发言。值得注意的是，这个发言完全反映了美国代表的观点。泰普潘提出了一个所谓四点建议。这个建议归结起来只有一个目的，就是要解散高棉抗战军队，取消解放区，消灭高棉民族解放运动，使高棉人民永远受美国和法国的殖民统治。泰普潘说，保证停止从印度支那境外增援的原则不能适用于高棉。不难看出，泰普潘的这种说法正是要使美国能够在高棉无限制地建立军事基地，从而直接威胁印度支那停战的稳定。泰普潘甚至公开叫嚣要增加高棉的傀儡军队。显然，这也是合乎美国利用印度支那人打印度支那人的政策的。泰普潘在国际监察停战的问题上，同样反映了美国的观点。他附和美国的意见，硬说朝鲜停战的经验，证明中立国监察是无效的。他主张由联合国来监督。
    苏联外交部长莫洛托夫接着发言（全文另发）。
    接着发言的是英国代表艾登。艾登说：会议已有了一些进展，虽则是缓慢的。他承认在主要问题上的分歧仍然是巨大的。
    艾登在谈到停战监督问题时同意：为了实施停战协定，应该由交战双方组成混合委员会。但是，艾登企图把这种混合委员会的职权贬低为“主要是技术上的”，并“明确地隶属于国际监察委员会的权力之下”。这种主张事实上就是漠视交战双方对停战协定的实施的主要责任，并把国际监察机构置于超乎交战双方的地位，而这是与中立国的协助与斡旋的作用不相容的。
    艾登接着提出以参加科伦坡会议的五个亚洲国家——缅甸、锡兰、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦五国作为组成国际监察委员会的国家。
    关于这个问题，苏联代表团早已提出过以印度、巴基斯坦、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克作为组成国际监察委员会的国家。这个建议受到中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国代表团的支持。苏联、中国和越南民主共和国代表团所依据的原则是：参加国际监察委员会的国家应是与交战双方分别保持政治和外交关系，能照顾双方意见和利益，俾能公正处理双方争端，使达成的协议能为双方接受。艾登所提出的建议，显然和这个原则不符。上述五国和越南民主共和国政府都没有外交关系。
    艾登最后谈到参加日内瓦会议各国对印度支那的和平给予国际保证的问题时，企图否认参加保证各国间一致协议采取集体措施的原则。这就为个别国家干涉印度支那事务大开方便之门。
    皮杜尔接着发言。他企图否认法国代表团不愿谈政治问题的谴责，但是他没有讲到一句尊重印度支那人民的民族权利的话。皮杜尔表示他也希望双方司令部代表在当地接触尽早开始。然而事实是这一接触由于法方的拖延迄今仍未开始。皮杜尔接着抱怨莫洛托夫引用西方报刊暴露法国当局现行政策实质的材料，但是他却无法否认莫洛托夫举出的任何一件事实。
    保大代表阮国定接着发言。他抱怨苏联代表和越南民主共和国代表对保大政府不得人心的揭发，可是他又无法否认众所周知的事实。
    美国代表史密斯发言。他也企图以所谓从高棉和寮国撤退事实上并不存在的越南人民军为借口，来达到消灭高棉和寮国抗战力量的目的。史密斯在谈到中立国监察委员会的成员问题时，故意歪曲朝鲜停战的经验，并重复在限制性会议上早已被驳倒了的说法，诬蔑波兰和捷克斯洛伐克不是“中立国”。史密斯表示艾登关于中立国委员会成员问题的建议可以考虑。
    莫洛托夫接着说，皮杜尔认为他刚才在发言中引用的报纸材料是侮辱性的说法是没有根据的。莫洛托夫说：我的发言不过是提出若干冷酷的事实。即使事实是冷酷的，也不能反对它。
    皮杜尔接着表示不愿再就此讨论下去。
    主席艾登接着宣布在名单上还有两个人要求发言。他在征得与会各国代表同意后宣布九日将继续举行讨论印度支那问题的全体会议。
