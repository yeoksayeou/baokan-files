Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, June 12th: The newly built first mechanized and automated thin plate plant in China, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Second Thin Plate Plant, officially began partial hot test rolling on the afternoon of the 11th.

The hot test rolling of the thin plate plant is being carried out separately according to the main production procedures. This time, the roughing mill is being tested. The slab is automatically loaded into the heating furnace by a magnetic suction feeder. After being heated for more than ten minutes, it is sent to the roughing mill for initial rolling. The red-hot slab is rolled several times by the roughing mill and becomes a thin plate semi-finished product that is many times wider than its original size.

If these semi-finished products are further finished, they can become thin plates.

    新建鞍钢第二薄板厂开始局部热试轧
    【新华社鞍山十二日电】我国新建第一座机械化自动化薄板厂——鞍山钢铁公司第二薄板厂，已经在十一日下午正式开始局部热试轧。
    薄板厂的热试轧是按照主要的生产程序分别进行的。这一次进行热试轧的是荒轧机。板坯被磁力吸料机自动地装到加热炉经过十多分钟的加热，就被送到荒轧机进行初轧。通红的板坯经过荒轧机压延几次，就变成比它原来宽大好多倍的薄板半成品。
    这些半成品如果再经过精轧，就可以成为薄板了。
