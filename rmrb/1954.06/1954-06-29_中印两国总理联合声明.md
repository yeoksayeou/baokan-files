Joint Statement of the Prime Ministers of China and India
June 28, 1954, Delhi

I. His Excellency Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China, came to Delhi at the invitation extended by His Excellency Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of India. He stayed here for three days. During this period, the two Prime Ministers discussed many matters of common concern to China and India. They gave special consideration to the prospects of peace in Southeast Asia and the developments that have already taken place at the Geneva Conference in regard to Indochina. The situation in Indochina is of vital importance to the peace of Asia and the world, and the two Prime Ministers are anxious that the efforts that are being made at Geneva should succeed. They are gratified to note that some progress has been made at Geneva in the negotiations for a cease-fire. They earnestly hope that these efforts will meet with success in the near future and lead to a political settlement of the problems of that area.

II. The talks between the two Prime Ministers were intended to further the efforts that are being made for a peaceful settlement in Geneva and elsewhere by assisting in a clarification of the issues involved. Their main purpose was to arrive at a clearer understanding of each other’s point of view so that they could cooperate with each other and with other countries in helping to maintain peace.

III. Recently China and India have come to an agreement in which they have laid down certain principles to govern their relations. These principles are:
	A. Mutual respect for each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty;
	B. Mutual non-aggression;
	C. Mutual non-interference in each other’s internal affairs;
	D. Equality and mutual benefit;
	E. Peaceful coexistence.

The two Prime Ministers reaffirmed these principles and felt that they should be applied in their relations with other countries in Asia as well as in other parts of the world. If these principles are applied not only between various countries but also in international relations generally, they would form a solid basis for peace and security, and the fears and apprehensions that exist today would give place to a feeling of confidence.

IV. The two Prime Ministers recognized that different social and political systems exist in various parts of Asia and the world. However, if the above-mentioned principles are accepted and acted upon, and each country refrained from interfering with another, these differences should not come in the way of peace or create conflict. With assurances of territorial integrity and sovereignty of each country and of non-aggression, there would be peaceful coexistence and friendly relations between such countries. This will lessen the tensions that exist in the world today, and help in creating an atmosphere of peace.

V. The two Prime Ministers were particularly anxious to apply these principles to the solution of the problems in Indochina. A political settlement in Indochina should aim at creating free, democratic, unified, and independent states, which should not be used for purposes of aggression or be subjected to foreign interference. This will lead to a growth of self-confidence in these countries and to friendly relations between them and their neighbors. The adoption of the above-mentioned principles will help in creating a peaceful area which, if circumstances permit, can be enlarged, thus reducing the chances of war and strengthening the cause of peace all over the world.

VI. The two Prime Ministers expressed their confidence in the friendship between China and India, which will help in the cause of world peace and in the peaceful development of their respective countries as well as of the other countries of Asia.

VII. These conversations have been helpful in promoting a greater understanding of Asian problems and in contributing to peaceful and cooperative efforts for the solution of these problems and similar problems in coordination with other countries in the world which share these aims and desires.

VIII. The two Prime Ministers agreed that their two countries should maintain close contacts so that there may continue to be full understanding between them. They appreciated greatly the opportunity they have had for this meeting and full exchange of views, which has furthered their understanding of each other and strengthened their cooperation in the cause of peace.

    中印两国总理联合声明
    一九五四年六月二十八日于德里
    中华人民共和国总理兼外交部部长周恩来阁下，应印度共和国总理兼外交部部长贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁阁下的邀请来到德里。他在这里停留三日。在这个期间，两国总理讨论了许多对中国和印度共同有关的事项。他们特别讨论了东南亚的和平前途和在日内瓦会议中关于印度支那所已经有的发展。印度支那的情况对于亚洲及世界和平至为重要，两国总理切望在日内瓦正在作的努力应该成功。他们满意地注意到，在日内瓦关于停战的谈判曾经获得一些进展。他们热诚地希望这些努力在最近的将来将能成功，并获致该地区各项问题的政治解决。
    二、两国总理的会谈，目的在于用可能的方法对于在日内瓦和其他地方正在为和平解决所作的努力加以协助。他们的主要目的是对彼此的观点获得更清楚的了解，以便彼此合作并与其他国家合作以协助维护和平。
    三、最近中国和印度曾经达成一项协议。在这一协议中，它们规定了为两国之间关系的某些原则。这些原则是：
          甲、互相尊重领土主权；
        乙、互不侵犯；
        丙、互不干涉内政；
        丁、平等互利；
        戊、和平共处。
    两国总理重申这些原则，并且感到在他们与亚洲以及世界其他国家的关系中也应该适用这些原则。如果这些原则不仅适用于各国之间，而且适用于一般国际关系之中，它们将形成和平和安全的坚固基础，而现时存在的恐惧和疑虑，则将为信任感所代替。
    四、两国总理承认，在亚洲及世界各地存在着不同的社会制度和政治制度。然而，如果接受上述各项原则并按照这些原则办事，任何一国又都不干涉另一国，这些差别就不应成为和平的障碍或造成冲突。有关各国中每一国家的领土主权和互不侵犯有了保证，这些国家就能和平共处并相互友好。这就会缓和目前存在于世界上的紧张局势，并有助于创造和平的气氛。
    五、两国总理特别希望在对印度支那问题的解决中，适用这些原则。在印度支那的政治解决应以创造自由、民主、统一和独立的各个国家为目的。这些国家不应被利用于侵略的目的，也不应受外来的干涉。这将使这些国家的自信增长，并导致这些国家相互之间和它们与其邻国之间的友好关系。采纳上述的各项原则，并将有助于创造一个和平的地区。如果情况许可，这一地区可以扩大，从而减少战争的可能，并加强全世界的和平事业。
    六、两国总理对于中国和印度之间的友谊，表示信心。这一友谊将有助于世界的和平事业，并有助于他们本国与亚洲其他国家的和平发展。
    七、这些会谈的目的是为了有助于对亚洲问题获致更大的了解，并为了推进和平的和合作的努力，与抱着同一目的的世界其他国家相配合，来解决这些问题和类似的问题。
    八、两国总理同意，中印两国应维持密切的接触，以便两国继续保持充分的了解。他们很高兴能有这次会晤和充分交换意见的机会，使他们在和平事业中有更明彻的了解和合作。
