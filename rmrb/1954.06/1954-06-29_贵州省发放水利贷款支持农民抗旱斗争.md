Guizhou Province Issues Water Conservancy Loans to Support Farmers' Fight Against Drought

This spring, Guizhou Province issued nearly 3 billion yuan in water conservancy loans. According to incomplete statistics, farmers in 50 counties, including Guiding, Meitan, Wangmo, Panxian, Wuchuan, Guanling, Liping, Zunyi, Bijie, Dejiang, and Dushan, had used the loans to build and repair more than 1,600 irrigation ditches and canals, 1,000 ponds, and 377 dikes and dams by the end of May. They also added more than 3,000 waterwheels, 15 water pumps, and a large number of other drought prevention and drought resistance tools. These efforts have powerfully supported the farmers' fight against drought, enabling them to carry out timely sowing and rice transplanting work. After the Xiao Ruzhen Agricultural Production Cooperative in Panxian County used a loan to build a dike more than 100 meters long, it prevented river sand from encroaching on the fields, turning many sandy fields into waterlogged fields, allowing for the timely transplanting of rice seedlings. Farmers in Xinchang Township, Guanling County, who had production difficulties, received loans from the state bank this year and purchased 16 dragon-bone water lifters and a batch of water-lifting tools, enabling many fields that could not be prepared for rice seedlings in previous years to be sown in time. The more than 300 *shi* of high-lying fields in Changlezhai were also turned into paddy fields.

People's Banks in various localities conducted arduous and in-depth work in issuing water conservancy loans. Bank cadres in the 15th District of Bijie County, while issuing water conservancy loans, took the initiative to assist supply and marketing cooperatives in organizing carpenters to find timber and solving the carpenters' food problems, enabling the supply and marketing cooperatives to prepare a batch of dragon-bone water lifters in time to meet the needs of the loan-receiving farmers for drought prevention and drought resistance. The Hongzhou branch of the People's Bank of Liping County, in helping farmers in Xiawen, Hongzhou Township, to build small-scale water conservancy projects, first cooperated with technical departments to assist local farmers in establishing a water conservancy committee to rationally use loans and provide specific guidance for the construction of projects. After the completion of the project, it also cooperated with technical departments to help the local people establish a water conservancy management and maintenance committee, responsible for organizing the rational use of water and protecting water conservancy projects. At present, this small-scale water conservancy project has begun to release water for irrigation, and more than 3,500 *mu* of dry land in Xiawen has since escaped the threat of drought.

    贵州省发放水利贷款支持农民抗旱斗争
    今年春季，贵州省各地共发放水利贷款近三十亿元。据不完全统计，贵定、湄潭、望谟、盘县、婺川、关岭、黎平、遵义、毕节、德江、独山等五十县的农民，到五月底已使用贷款兴修和整修水沟、水渠一千六百多处、水塘一千口、堤坝三百七十七道，添置水车三千多架、抽水机十五架，和大批其他防旱、抗旱工具。这些，都有力地支持了农民的抗旱斗争，使农民适时进行了播种和插秧工作。盘县萧汝贞农业生产合作社用贷款修了一道一百多公尺长的水堤后，挡住河沙不能侵入田内，使许多沙田变成了饱水田，适时插上了秧苗。关岭县新场乡生产上有困难的农民今年得到国家银行贷款后，买进了十六架龙骨车和一批提水工具，使许多往年无法打秧田的田及时撒了秧；该乡长乐寨三百多石的高膀田，也都变成了有水田。
    各地人民银行在发放水利贷款中，进行了艰苦深入的工作。毕节县第十五区的银行干部在发放水利贷款同时，主动协助供销合作社组织木工找木料，为木工解决口粮问题，使供销合作社及时准备出一批龙骨车，供应了贷款农民防旱、抗旱的需要。人民银行黎平支行洪州营业所在帮助洪州乡下温地方农民兴修小型水利工程中，首先配合技术部门协助当地农民成立了水利委员会，来合理使用贷款和具体指导兴修工程；工程竣工后，又协同技术部门帮助当地成立了水利管理养护委员会，负责组织合理用水和保护水利工程。目前这一小型水利工程已开始放水灌溉，下温地方的三千五百多亩旱田从此摆脱了旱灾的威胁。
