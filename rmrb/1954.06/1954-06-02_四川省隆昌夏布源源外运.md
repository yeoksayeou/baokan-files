Sichuan Province's Longchang Ramie Cloth Continuously Shipped Out

Ramie cloth handicraft producers in Longchang County, Sichuan Province, are stepping up their weaving of ramie cloth. Currently, the woven ramie cloth has been successively transferred to Chongqing for transshipment to Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou and other places. Some of the ramie cloth will also be exported.

Longchang ramie cloth is a well-known product in the Southwest region, and decades ago it was sold throughout the country and exported overseas. After liberation, under the leadership and support of the People's Government, Longchang ramie cloth handicraft workers solved the difficulties in production and sales and improved production technology, and ramie cloth production has seen new development. This year, the county's total production of ramie cloth will increase by 10% compared to last year, and more than double that of 1948. The quality of ramie cloth has also been improved.

At present, six ramie cloth handicraft production cooperatives and a number of production teams have been established in the county. The average output of each member of the handicraft production cooperative has increased by more than 15% compared to individual producers; the production cost is 2.4% lower than that of individual producers on average.

    四川省隆昌夏布源源外运
    四川省隆昌县的夏布手工业生产者正加紧编织夏布。目前，织好的夏布已陆续调到重庆，转运北京、上海、武汉、广州等地。部分夏布还将出口。
    隆昌夏布是西南区有名的产品，几十年前即销售全国各地，并远销国外。解放以后，隆昌夏布手工业者在人民政府的领导、扶植下，解决了生产、销路中的困难，改进了生产技术，夏布生产有了新的发展。今年全县生产夏布的数量，将比去年增加百分之十，比一九四八年增加一倍多，夏布的质量也有所提高。
    目前，全县已成立了六个夏布手工业生产合作社及一批生产小组。手工业生产合作社每个社员的平均产量，比个体生产者提高了百分之十五以上；产品成本比个体生产者平均降低百分之二点四。
