    Careful Harvesting and Threshing to Ensure Every Grain Returns Home
    Rushing to Harvest Wheat in Luoma Lake
    Luoma Lake is located in Suqian County, northern Jiangsu Province, with a total area of about 250,000 mu. During the governance of the Yi River in 1949, Luoma Lake was built as a temporary flood storage reservoir for the Xin Yi River. Since then, in addition to being used to block the YI River's floods in summer and autumn, it can also harvest a crop of wheat every year. This year, the wheat in the lake is growing better than in the past few decades, with an estimated yield of more than 200 jin per mu. In order to rush to harvest the wheat before the flood arrives, the Suqian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a special meeting to study the issue of rush harvesting. After the meeting, in addition to mobilizing and organizing farmers from other places to provide support, it also provided loans of more than 300 million yuan to help farmers sell more than 1,000 cattle and donkeys, more than 100 carts, and repaired more than 200 carts, solving the problem of insufficient manpower and animal power, and repaired the large and small roads in the lake to facilitate harvesting and transportation. Harvesting began on June 1st, and all the wheat in the lake can be rush-harvested before June 10th. (Zhang Yadong)
    Harvest as it Ripens
    The Luo Chengxi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qinghua Township, Yuxiang County, Shanxi Province, has very good wheat this year. The cooperative's 145 mu of wheat fields are expected to yield 27,000 jin, exceeding last year's output by about 50%. In order to strive for the cooperative to sell 11,000 jin of new wheat to the state to support national construction, the cooperative has now made preparations for wheat harvesting. The cooperative has cleaned up 25 threshing grounds, added 70 brooms, more than 100 forks, and more than 120 sickles, repaired three carts, and brought back 10,000 jin of coal, 30 bags of salt, and kerosene and other daily necessities for the members. In order to achieve "harvest as it ripens," the cooperative has organized an inspection team to check the ripening of the wheat at any time, and organized nine wheat protection teams to take turns protecting the fields and threshing grounds, to achieve fast harvesting and careful threshing, and ensure every grain returns home.
    Mutual Aid Contracts Eliminate the Threat of Wind Disaster
    The wheat of the Li Jingcai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Taoli Village, Yongji County, Shanxi Province, is growing particularly well this year. Every member is happy for the good wheat harvest this year, but the members are very worried about wind disasters. Last year, after 13 mu of high-yielding wheat matured, because labor was not available and agricultural tools and livestock were insufficient, the harvest was delayed by half a day, and it was attacked by wind, resulting in a reduction of one dou per mu. Therefore, the members said with regret: "It's a pity that the grain at the doorstep was ruined by the wind!" The members of the Taigutun Agricultural Production Cooperative were also equally anxious about this matter. However, the Taigutun Cooperative is located on sandy land on the mountain, and the wheat matures about five days earlier than the Li Jingcai Cooperative. After research by the cadres of the two cooperatives and discussions at the members' meeting, a mutual aid contract was signed based on the principle of mutual benefit. According to the maturity of the wheat, the Li Jingcai Cooperative will first draw 43 male and female laborers to help the Taigutun Cooperative to rush to harvest wheat, and then the Taigutun Cooperative will draw 13 laborers, two carts, and two livestock to help the Li Jingcai Cooperative harvest. In this way, the two cooperatives can complete the wheat harvest in time and avoid the wind or other disasters. (Li Qi)
      Organize Labor and Arrange Summer Harvest
    The Tuanjie Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, is a large cooperative in the Guanzhong area. In order to do a good job in this year's summer harvest, they have repaired agricultural tools, smoothed the threshing grounds, and decided to establish field protection teams, summer harvest nurseries, etc. They have also carefully organized labor, dividing the members into wheat cutting teams, wheat pulling teams, and wheat threshing teams. It was also decided that before the summer harvest, the production evaluation team would measure all the wheat fields in the cooperative, and then decide the order of harvesting according to the growth of the crops, estimate the output, and implement a production guarantee system. In order to avoid the tendency of random pulling and placing of wheat, the cooperative decided to fix all kinds of crops to each team, each group, and each household according to the size of the field. For the high-yield wheat and chemical fertilizer demonstration wheat cultivated by the mutual aid group last year, separate harvesting, separate threshing, and separate storage are carried out. During the threshing period, each production brigade must also organize a statistics team to accurately count the harvest of various types of crops on each field, laying a good foundation for profit distribution. In order to complete the summer harvest task well, in addition to proposing a competition to all agricultural production cooperatives in the county, the cooperative also made red flags and carried out labor competitions between teams and teams, groups and groups, and members and members.
    Not a Grain Left on the Stalk, Not a Grain Scattered on the Ground
    The Wang Chuanmo mutual aid group in Zhenghe District, Huaining County, Anhui Province, in order to harvest in a timely manner and strive for this year's summer crops to return home, repaired three collapsed rice fields, repaired three carrying poles and six baskets, added and sharpened fourteen sickles, and made four new bamboo winnowing fans as early as the end of April, preparing to start harvesting barley and rapeseed. In order to prevent the scattering of wheat grains and rapeseed, it was decided to harvest rapeseed in the morning while the dew had not dried, and then harvest barley at noon; at the same time, bring bamboo winnowing fans to the fields and tie wheat and rapeseed bundles on the winnowing fans. In addition, five children were organized to pick up wheat ears in the fields. Seven women in the group who cannot do heavy work all stay at home to thresh wheat; they decided to turn the wheat and rapeseed bundles more times this year to ensure that: the fields are harvested cleanly, and the wheat is threshed completely; not a grain is left on the stalk, and not a grain is scattered on the ground.
    Reasonable Allocation of Labor to Resolve Conflicts in Priorities
    The farmers in Genglou Township, Shouchang County, Zhejiang Province, have generally adopted the advanced experience of appropriate close planting of rice this year. Therefore, the township needs to increase more than 470 laborers compared with last year. This year, the planting area of wheat, rapeseed, etc. in the township has also expanded by 17% compared with last year. In addition, careful harvesting and threshing are required during the harvest, which makes the labor shortage even more acute, and the conflicts in priorities are difficult to resolve. Because the conflict of rush harvesting was not resolved, Xu Jiangfeng, a member of the He Shugen mutual aid group, suffered losses to her two mu of rapeseed and withdrew from the group. After the cadres of the township learned about this situation, they went deep into key groups to lead and find ways to solve these problems. In addition to formulating a summer harvest plan and reasonably allocating labor, the township established five summer harvest nurseries and mobilized more than 230 women to participate in production. Specific measures to resolve conflicts in priorities were also determined. At the same time, the summer harvest wages were appropriately adjusted according to the quality of the crops and the distance of the roads. The farmers were very satisfied with these measures. Therefore, the ten mutual aid groups that had disbanded have now been restored. Xu Jiangfeng, who had withdrawn from the group, also returned to the group. Now all 41 mutual aid groups in the township have made preparations and are about to invest in the summer harvest.
      Ensure That Not a Single Grain of Wheat is Lost
    The Liu Yangzhou Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nangong Township, Zou County, Shandong Province, suffered a loss of more than 600 jin of wheat due to the lack of a careful plan and rough harvesting and threshing during the wheat harvest last year. This year, the cooperative accepted last year's lessons and formulated a summer harvest plan early, and prepared more than 100 pieces of agricultural tools such as forks, brooms, sickles, shovels, and harrows. Recently, the cooperative affairs committee further implemented the education of careful harvesting and threshing through checking the preparation work for the summer harvest, and specifically stipulated the method of "careful harvesting and threshing, every grain returns home," requiring timely harvesting, not being greedy for more and faster, being careful when loading and unloading, making preparations for wind prevention, fire prevention, and prevention of continuous rain rotting wheat stacks, ensuring even spreading during threshing, spreading the threshed wheat bran again, and blocking the threshed wheat stalks again, ensuring that not a single grain of wheat is lost.

    仔细收割打场保证颗粒还家
    骆马湖内抢割小麦
    骆马湖在江苏省北部宿迁县境内，全湖区共约有二十五万多亩地的面积。一九四九年导治沂河时，骆马湖被建成新沂河的临时蓄洪水库，从那时起，除夏秋用来拦蓄沂河暴发洪水外，每年还可以收获一季小麦。今年湖里的小麦长得比过去几十年都好，估计每亩可收二百余斤。为了在洪水到来前把小麦抢收完毕，中共宿迁县委特召开专门会议研究抢收问题。会后，除动员组织外地农民前往支援外，并贷款三亿多元帮助农民卖了一千多头牛、驴，一百多辆大车，修理大车二百多辆，解决了人力、畜力不足的问题，并修理了湖中的大小车路，以便随割随拉。六月一日已经开始收割，六月十日以前全湖小麦可以全部抢收完毕。（张亚东）
    熟一块割一块
    山西省虞乡县清华乡罗承鄎农业生产合作社，今年小麦长得很好，全社一百四十五亩麦田，预计可收二万七千斤，超过去年产量百分之五十左右。为了争取全社卖给国家一万一千斤新麦，支援国家建设，现在该社已作好麦收准备工作。全社已收拾好二十五个场，新添了七十把扫帚，一百多把杈子，一百二十多把镰刀，修理了三辆大车，并给社员拉回一万斤炭，三十袋盐和煤油等日常生活必需品。为了作到“熟一块割一块”，社内组织了一个检查组，随时检查麦熟情况，并组织了九个护麦小组，轮流护场护田，作到快收快打和细收细打，保证颗粒还家。
    互助合同解除了风灾威胁
    山西省永济县桃李村李敬才农业生产合作社的小麦，今年生长得特别好，每个社员都为今年的小麦获得丰收而高兴，但是社员们却非常担心风灾。去年十三亩丰产麦成熟后，因劳力顾不上和农具、牲口不够用，晚收割半天，就遭风灾侵袭而每亩减收
  一斗，所以社员们提起这事就惋惜地说：“到了门口上的粮食，被风糟蹋了真可惜！”太谷屯农业生产合作社的社员们，也同样为这件事情焦心。但是太谷屯社是靠山沙地，小麦成熟期一般比李敬才社要早五天左右。经两社干部研究和社员大会讨论后，根据互利原则，订立了互助合同。他们按小麦成熟的早晚，规定李敬才社先抽出四十三个男女劳动力帮助太谷屯社，突击收割小麦，然后太谷屯社再抽出劳力十三人，大车两辆，牲口两头帮助李敬才社收割。这样两个社就可及时地完成小麦收割任务，免受风或其他灾害的侵袭。（李琦）
      组织劳力安排夏收
    陕西省大荔县团结农业生产合作社，是关中地区较大的一个社。他们为了做好今年夏收，现已修好了农具、光好麦场，并决定成立护田队、农忙托儿所等，还认真地组织了劳力，把社员分编成割麦组、拉麦组、碾麦组。又决定在夏收前由评产小组把全社所有麦田进行一次测量，然后依照庄稼生长情况决定收割先后，估出产量，实行产量保证制。为了避免乱拉乱放麦的偏向发生，社里决定把各类庄稼，按场的大小固定分给各队、各组、各户。对于去年互助组培养的丰产小麦、化学肥料试范小麦等作到单收、单碾、单藏。碾场期间，各生产大队，还要组织统计小组，逐场把各类庄稼收获量精确统计，给分红打好基础。他们为了很好完成夏收任务，决定除向全县各农业生产合作社提出竞赛外，社内还做了红旗，开展队与队、组与组、社员与社员之间的劳动竞赛。
    秸上不留一粒，场上不撒一颗
    安徽省怀宁县郑河区汪传谟互助组，为了适时收割，争取今年的夏季作物颗粒还家，早在四月底就挑土修补了三个崩塌的稻场，修理了三条锚担、六担包篮，添置和新锉了十四张镰刀，新打了四个竹簸箕，准备开始收割大麦和油菜。为了防止麦粒、菜籽抛撒，决定早上趁露水没干去割油菜，晌午再去割大麦；同时把竹簸箕带到田里，在簸箕上捆麦把、油菜把。另外还组织五个儿童到田里拾麦穗。组内还有七个不能干重活的妇女，都留在家里打麦子；她们决定将今年的麦把、菜把多翻打一交，保证做到：田里收净、家里打完；秸上不留一粒、场上不撒一颗。
    合理支配劳力，解决先后矛盾
    浙江省寿昌县更楼乡的农民，今年普遍采用水稻适当密植的先进经验，因此，全乡比去年需要增加四百七十多个劳动力。今年全乡的小麦、油菜等种植面积也比去年扩大百分之十七，再加上收割时要做到细收细打，这就更加感到劳动力不足，生产先后矛盾，问题不好解决。何树根互助组因抢收的矛盾未解决，组员徐江凤的二亩油菜受了损失，因而退了组。该乡干部了解了这些情况后，即深入重点组领导，找出解决这些问题的办法。除了制订了夏收计划，合理支配劳动力外，全乡成立了五个农忙托儿组，发动了二百三十多个妇女参加了生产。并确定了解决生产先后矛盾的具体办法，同时还根据作物好坏，路途远近等条件，适当调整了夏收工资，农民对这些办法都很满意，因此，原来散伙的十个互助组现又恢复了互助。已退组的徐江凤也回到组里。现在全乡四十一个互助组都已做好准备工作，即将投入夏收。
      保证不丢掉一粒麦子
    山东省邹县南宫乡刘仰周农业生产合作社，去年麦收时因没有仔细的计划，收打都很粗糙，因此，全社约损失了六百多斤麦子。今年该社接受了去年的教训，很早就订立了夏收计划，并准备好了杈子、扫帚、镰刀、锨、耙子等农具一百多件。最近该社社务委员会又通过检查夏收准备工作，进一步贯彻了细收细打的教育，并具体规定了“细收细打，颗粒还家”的办法，要求做到收割适时，不要贪多求快，装卸车时要仔细，做好防风、防火和防备连阴雨烂麦垛等准备工作，扬场时要做到均匀，扬过的麦糠再扬一遍，打过的麦穰再拦一遍，保证不使一粒麦子丢掉。
