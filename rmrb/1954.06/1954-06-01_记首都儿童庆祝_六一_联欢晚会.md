    A Record of the Capital Children's "June 1st" Celebration Party
    Kan Wen
    On the eve of "June 1st" International Children's Day, the children of the capital held a grand celebration party at the Altar of Land and Grain in Zhongshan Park.
    At dusk, more than 1,600 children wearing bright red scarves poured into the park's gate in teams. This garden immediately became extraordinarily lively. The magnificent palaces, the lush and verdant ancient cypress trees lining the roads, and the fragrant flowers and plants were all infected by these innocent, lively, and joyous little guests, making them even more radiant.
    The central area of the park—the Altar of Land and Grain—was entirely a festive scene. The entire altar was filled with flowers,彩旗, and lanterns. Inside the enclosure, among the lilac bushes, and by the colorful lawns, one could see rosy faces like little apples everywhere, and red-scarved teenagers everywhere. They were playing, jumping, chasing, and shouting, and their clear laughter and singing resounded through the sky. To the accompaniment of songs and music, everyone danced collective dances such as the "Double Dance" and the "Circle Dance." Hao Jianxiu came from outside the city to participate in the party, and the children immediately surrounded her, asking her to dance as well. In the northeast corner of the altar, pairs of Chinese and Korean children were dancing the double dance. They were as affectionate as brothers and sisters as soon as they met. The elderly Gao Shiqi sat on the altar, smiling as he watched the adorable children around him. How happy they are!
    The earth was completely shrouded in the darkness of night. At this moment, a dazzling star rushed from the lilac forest in front of the music hall into the sky. In an instant, countless sparks rose into the air, radiating thousands of colorful rays. Like lighthouses, they illuminated the night sky brightly. The children stared intently at the sky, waving their hands and feet and cheering: "What a happy night! What beautiful fireworks! Fly! Fly higher!" In this surging wave of laughter, loud singing also rang out:
    Our flag is as red as fire,
    Stars and torches point out the future.
    The wind of peace blows the flag,
    Calling us to a happy life. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

    记首都儿童庆祝“六一”联欢晚会
    阚文
    “六一”国际儿童节前夕的夜晚，首都儿童在中山公园社稷坛举行了一个盛大的联欢晚会。
    傍晚时分，一千六百多扎着鲜艳红领巾的儿童结队涌进了公园的大门，这座园林立刻变得热闹非凡，那金碧辉煌的宫阙、郁蔚苍翠的夹道古柏、芬芳四溢的花草……都被这些天真、活泼、喜气洋洋的小客人感染得更加神采焕发。
    公园的中心区——社稷坛完全是一片节日的景象，全坛布满了鲜花、彩旗和花灯。在壝垣里面，在丁香林丛中，在五色草坪边，到处都可以看到小苹果似的红润面孔，到处都是红领巾少年，他们嬉戏着、蹦跳着、追逐着和喊叫着，清脆的笑声和歌声响彻天空。随着歌声和音乐声，大家跳起“双人舞”、“圆圈舞”等集体舞。郝建秀从城外赶来参加晚会，孩子一下就把她包围住，要她也来跳舞。在坛的东北面，一对对中朝小朋友正在跳双人舞，他们一见面就像兄弟姊妹般亲热。年老的高士其坐在坛上，微笑地看着周围可爱的孩子。他们是多么幸福呀！
    大地完全被夜幕笼罩着了。这时一颗耀眼的明星，从音乐堂前的丁香林中冲向云霄，转瞬间又有无数的火花腾空升起，放射出千万道彩色的光芒，它们像灯塔一样，把夜空照耀得通亮。孩子们目不转睛地注视着天空，手舞足蹈地欢呼着：“多么幸福的夜晚！多么好看的焰火呀！飞吧！飞得更高吧！”在这翻腾的欢笑的浪涛里又响起了嘹亮的歌声：
    我们的旗帜火一样红，
    星星和火把指明前程。
    和平的风吹动了旗帜，
    招呼我们走向幸福的人生。…………………………
