    Further Develop Cultural Work in Factories and Mines
    The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have jointly issued instructions on strengthening cultural and artistic work in factories, mines, construction sites, and enterprises, stipulating specific guidelines and methods for carrying out cultural and artistic work in factories and mines in the future. This will actively promote further satisfying the cultural needs of workers, thereby enhancing their socialist awareness and inspiring their labor enthusiasm for building socialism.
    With the development of national economic construction and the increasing demand of workers for cultural life, the popularization of culture and the amateur artistic activities of workers in factories and mines have been greatly developed. More than 1,200 mobile film projection teams have been established to show films exclusively for workers, along with nearly 10,000 trade union clubs and more than 10,000 various types of amateur art organizations. These have played a huge role in improving the cultural life of workers and helping to improve their political awareness and labor enthusiasm. However, the current cultural work in factories and mines is not yet adapted to the needs of national economic construction and the growing cultural demands of the vast number of workers. The desire of the working masses for cultural knowledge is like a thirst; they urgently need to improve their culture; they need proper, cultural rest and entertainment in addition to their intense, combat-like labor. However, these requirements have not been well met. Literary and artistic workers have done a lot of work to serve the working masses, but what they have already done is still far from what the workers need. There are too few literary and artistic works that suit the needs of workers and are easily accepted by them. Many workers are still reading some old, poisonous popular works or going to some unreformed, vulgar entertainment venues to seek entertainment. This phenomenon is not good and is harmful to the physical and mental health of workers, and must be improved. Therefore, developing cultural work in factories and mines has become an urgent task. Some government cultural departments or trade union organizations do not have sufficient understanding of the significance and importance of developing cultural and artistic work for workers, lack specific guidelines and practical guidance for the amateur artistic activities of the vast number of workers, and have not been able to fully and rationally utilize existing cultural institutions and tools. Government cultural departments and trade union organizations lack unified deployment and coordinated steps in cultural and artistic work in factories and mines, and there is a certain degree of independent operation. These shortcomings must be overcome urgently.
    Our country's large-scale economic construction has begun. Socialist economic construction is creating conditions for the working class and all working people to develop and build their own culture, while the people's cultural construction and the dissemination of socialist ideas are in turn giving a positive impact on socialist economic construction. The higher the level of socialist awareness and cultural level of the people, the faster the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation can be realized. It is inconceivable that we can build socialism in a situation where the working class and working people lack the necessary cultural knowledge and lack socialist awareness. Cultural undertakings in factories and mines are an important organic component of national socialist construction, which is necessary not only to improve the culture of workers, but also to develop production. Government cultural departments at all levels and trade union organizations at all levels must regard the development of cultural work in factories and mines as a common responsibility, cooperate in division of labor, use the power of the state and society, and rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of workers to actively and steadily promote cultural work in factories and mines.
    First of all, the development plan of cultural undertakings must adapt to and obey the plan of the entire national economic construction. Our country is building new enterprises and new industrial bases in a planned and step-by-step manner, and in terms of cultural undertakings, we should consider the necessary cultural facilities and construction based on this new development, such as building cinemas, theaters, cultural palaces, clubs, etc. In old cities, most cultural facilities are concentrated in commercial centers. Our urban construction plans should consider adding various necessary cultural facilities in areas with more factories and concentrated workers' dormitories. Under the current conditions, we cannot hope to fully satisfy the cultural and welfare requirements of the vast number of workers in the shortest possible time. When developing cultural undertakings in factories and mines, we must be planned, step-by-step, and focused, and gradually meet the material and cultural requirements of workers on the basis of continuous development of production.
    Various existing cultural institutions and various cultural propaganda tools must be fully utilized and strengthened. At present, we still lack complete experience and systems in cultural work for workers, and there are still some problems in the operation and management of existing cultural undertakings. For example, in the work of film distribution and projection, on the one hand, there is a failure to attach importance to and take care of the needs of workers, and one-sided emphasis on the purely profit-making viewpoint of enterprise management; on the other hand, there is a viewpoint of simply emphasizing workers' welfare and ignoring enterprise management. The tour performances of troupes to factories and mines are not frequent enough and lack planning. Some drama programs are not entirely suitable for the needs of the working masses. These are all hindering the normal development of cultural undertakings in factories and mines. Fully and rationally utilizing the existing various cultural and artistic undertakings and institutions, strengthening their operation and management, and changing the past situation of poor management and low efficiency in order to better serve the working masses is a very important task in developing cultural work in factories and mines.
    The further development of cultural work in factories and mines requires our professional literary and artistic workers to create more works that reflect the lives and struggles of the working masses and are suitable for the needs of the working masses. Our country's socialist construction urgently requires literary and artistic creation to truthfully reflect the actual life and struggle of the working people in this transitional period full of contradictions and struggles, and to reflect their thoughts, psychology, emotions, and aspirations. Literary and artistic creation should help guide our country's working class and working people to raise their ideological awareness to the level of socialism, and criticize from all aspects all backward and conservative ideas that run counter to socialism. This requires literary and artistic workers to enthusiastically throw themselves into the struggle of life, encourage the advanced, criticize the backward, and profoundly and vividly express the contradictory struggle between the advanced and the backward that exists everywhere in our lives. Literary and artistic workers should create works that can educate the working masses and are easily accepted by them, and should combine the ideological and artistic nature of the works with their popularity, and help cultivate worker correspondents and worker writers with full enthusiasm. Only in this way can they best fulfill their responsibility to serve the working masses.
    Cultural work in factories and mines cannot rely solely on the activities of professional cultural and artistic workers to meet the growing cultural demands of the working masses. At the same time, it must rely on carrying out the amateur cultural and artistic activities of the workers themselves. Only by carrying out this kind of activity can culture be truly popularized among the vast number of workers, can the initiative of mass creation be developed, and can the cultural life of the masses be enlivened and enriched. The working class is not only an enthusiastic receiver of new cultural achievements, but also an active participant in new cultural creation. Their rich creativity is not only reflected in material production, but also in spiritual production. Their demand for amateur cultural and artistic activities is a manifestation of their rich creativity and their improved political awareness. As long as these activities receive correct help and guidance, they will greatly help to improve the socialist thinking and cultural level of workers and increase their enthusiasm for labor production. Some places believe that amateur artistic activities hinder production, and therefore adopt a negative and restrictive attitude, which is completely wrong. Government cultural departments and trade union organizations should actively and correctly guide and support the amateur cultural and artistic activities of workers. The Party organizations in factories and mines should be responsible for leading these activities politically and ideologically. On the one hand, the content of these activities should educate the working masses with socialist spirit, and on the other hand, attention must be paid to the cultural and entertainment role that these activities must have. At the same time, it is also necessary to overcome and prevent the narrow view and practice of one-sidedly and mechanically requiring literary and artistic creation to express the production activities of the factory or mine. The vast number of workers should be educated through amateur artistic activities to obtain a broad communist outlook on life, to obtain multi-faceted knowledge of the life of the country and the people, and to improve the level of cultural education. Supplying reading materials and singing materials suitable for the needs of workers and cultivating the backbone of cultural and artistic activities of workers are two main key issues in carrying out the amateur cultural and artistic activities of workers. Government cultural departments and trade union organizations should do these two tasks vigorously. First of all, they should work with relevant literary and art groups such as writers' associations and musicians' associations to organize the writing and publication of works suitable for workers to read or sing. Secondly, they should plan to run amateur art schools or training classes for workers and pay attention to discovering and cultivating young people with artistic talent among the workers. Local experience has proved that amateur learning and observation competitions are effective methods for cultivating and improving the backbone of amateur artistic activities, and various places can adopt them according to specific circumstances.
    To cooperate with national economic construction, strengthen and do a good job in the cultural and artistic work in factories, mines, construction sites, and enterprises to meet the cultural requirements of the working masses is the task that government cultural departments at all levels and trade union organizations at all levels must undertake. As long as we firmly rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of workers, this task can be accomplished.

### 进一步开展工矿文化工作

    进一步开展工矿文化工作
    中央人民政府文化部、中华全国总工会联合发布了关于加强厂矿、工地、企业中文化艺术工作的指示，规定了今后开展工矿文化艺术工作的具体方针和办法，这对进一步满足职工的文化要求，并从而提高他们的社会主义觉悟和鼓舞他们建设社会主义事业的劳动热情，将有积极的推动作用。
    随着国家经济建设的发展和职工对文化生活的需要的增长，各地厂矿、企业中的文化普及工作和职工业余艺术活动已有了很大的开展。现在各地已经建立了一千二百多个专为工人放映电影的流动放映队，近一万个工会俱乐部和一万多个各种类型的业余艺术组织。这些在改善职工文化生活及帮助提高职工政治觉悟和劳动热情上起了巨大的作用。但是目前工矿文化工作和国家经济建设的需要及广大职工在文化生活上日益增长的要求还不相适应。工人群众对文化知识的欲望是如饥如渴的；他们迫切需要提高自己的文化；他们在紧张的、战斗式的劳动之余，需要有正当的、文化性的休息和娱乐。但是这些要求却没有很好地得到满足。文艺工作者在为工人群众服务上做了不少的工作，但他们所已经做了的和工人群众所需要的还是差得很远啊。适合工人需要而又易于为他们接受的文学艺术作品是太少了。不少工人还在看一些旧的、有毒素的通俗作品或到一些没有经过改革的、下流的娱乐场所去寻找娱乐。这种现象是不好的，对工人的身心健康是有害的，必须加以改善。因此，开展工矿文化工作已成为目前迫切的任务。有些政府文化主管部门或工会组织对开展职工文化艺术工作的意义和重要性还认识不足，对广大职工的业余文艺活动缺乏具体的方针和切实的指导，对现有的文化事业机构和工具还未能充分合理地加以运用。政府文化主管部门和工会组织对工矿文化艺术工作缺乏统一的部署和协同的步调，存在着某种程度的各自为政的现象。这些缺点亟须克服。
    我国大规模经济建设已经开始。社会主义经济建设正为工人阶级和全体劳动人民发展和建设自己的文化创造条件，同时人民的文化建设和社会主义思想的传播又反过来给社会主义经济建设以积极影响。人民的社会主义觉悟水平和文化水平愈提高，社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业便能实现得愈快。不能设想，在工人阶级和劳动人民缺少必要的文化知识，缺少社会主义的觉悟的情况下，我们能够把社会主义建设起来。工矿文化事业是国家社会主义建设的一个重要的有机组成部分，这是不只为了提高工人文化，而且为了发展生产所必需的。政府各级文化主管部门和工会各级组织必须把开展工矿文化工作视为共同的职责，分工合作，运用国家和社会的力量，依靠广大职工群众的积极性和创造性，把工矿文化工作积极地稳步地向前推进。
    首先，文化事业发展计划必须适应和服从国家整个经济建设事业的计划。我们国家正在有计划、有步骤地建设新的企业和新的工业基地，在文化事业上便应该根据这种新的发展的情况考虑必需的文化设施和建设，如修建影院、剧场、文化宫、俱乐部等。在旧有城市中，各项文化设施大多集中在商业中心区，我们的城市建设计划，就应考虑在工厂较多和职工宿舍集中区域增加各种必要的文化设施。在目前条件下，我们不能希望在最短期间就能把广大职工的文化和福利要求完全予以满足，我们在发展工矿文化事业时，必须是有计划，有步骤，有重点的，在生产不断发展的基础上逐步满足职工物质和文化的要求。
    对于已有的各种文化事业机构和各种文化宣传工具，必须充分利用，加强管理。目前我们对职工文化工作还缺乏完整的经验和制度，在对现有文化事业的经营管理上还存在着一些问题。如在电影发行放映工作上，一方面有不重视、不照顾工人需要而片面地强调企业经营的单纯营利观点，另一方面又有单纯强调工人福利而忽视企业化经营的观点。剧团到工矿的巡回演出还不够经常，还缺少计划性。有些戏剧节目还不完全适合工人群众的需要。这些都是妨碍工矿文化事业的正常发展的。把现有的各种文化艺术事业和机构充分合理地加以运用，加强其经营管理，改变过去经营不善和效率不高的情况，以便更好地为职工群众服务，这是开展工矿文化工作中一项十分重要的任务。
    工矿文化工作的进一步开展，要求我们的职业的文学艺术家们创作出更多的表现工人群众的生活和斗争的、适合职工群众需要的作品。我们国家的社会主义建设事业迫切要求文学艺术创作真实地反映这个充满矛盾和斗争的过渡时期劳动人民的实际生活和斗争，反映他们的思想、心理、情感和愿望。文学艺术创作应该帮助引导我国的工人阶级和劳动人民把自己的思想意识提高到社会主义的水平，从各方面批判一切与社会主义背道而驰的落后保守思想。这便要求文学艺术家热烈地投入生活的斗争中，鼓励先进，批评落后，把我们生活中到处存在着的先进和落后的矛盾斗争，深刻地形象地表现出来。文学艺术家应该创作出能够教育工人群众而又易于为他们接受的作品，应当使作品的思想性和艺术性同作品的通俗性结合起来，并以满腔热情帮助培养工人通讯员和工人作家。只有这样，才是最好地尽到了为工人群众服务的职责。
    工矿文化工作不能只靠专业的文化艺术工作者的活动来满足职工群众日益增长的文化要求，同时必须依靠开展职工自己的业余文化艺术活动。只有开展这种活动，才能使文化真正普及于广大职工群众，才能发展群众创造的主动性，活跃和丰富群众的文化生活。工人阶级不仅是新文化成果的热忱的接受者，而且也是新文化创造的积极参加者，他们的丰富的创造力不仅表现在物质生产上，而且也表现在精神生产上。他们对业余文化艺术活动的要求正是他们创造力丰富和他们的政治觉悟提高的表现。这些活动只要得到正确的帮助和指导，就会大大地有助于提高工人的社会主义思想和文化水平，提高他们的劳动生产的热情。有的地方，认为业余文艺活动妨碍生产，因而采取消极限制的态度，这是完全错误的。政府文化主管部门和工会组织应对职工业余文化艺术活动积极地、正确地加以指导和扶助。工矿中的党组织应当在政治上思想上负责领导这些活动。一方面要使这些活动的内容能以社会主义精神教育职工群众，另一方面又必须注意这些活动必须具有的文化娱乐的作用。同时也要克服和防止片面地机械地要求文艺创作必须表现本厂矿的生产活动的狭隘观点和作法。应该使广大职工群众通过业余艺术活动获得广阔的共产主义人生观的教育。获得国家和人民生活的多方面的知识，提高文化教养水平。供应适合职工需要的读物和演唱材料和培养职工文化艺术活动的骨干，是开展职工业余文化艺术活动的两个主要关键问题。政府文化主管部门和工会组织应以大力做好这两项工作，首先要会同有关文艺团体如作家协会、音乐家协会等，组织编写和出版适合职工阅读或演唱的作品。其次要有计划地举办职工业余艺术学校或训练班并注意发现和培养工人中有艺术天才的青年。各地经验证明，业余学习和观摩比赛是培养和提高业余艺术活动骨干分子的有效方法，各地可以根据具体情况加以采用。
    配合国家经济建设，加强并做好厂矿、工地、企业中的文化艺术工作，以满足职工群众的文化要求，这是政府各级文化主管部门和工会各级组织必须担负的任务。只要坚决依靠广大职工的积极性和创造性，这个任务是能够完成的。
