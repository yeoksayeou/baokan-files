    Shandong Province Farmers Actively Engage in Summer Production
    Shandong Province farmers are actively engaged in summer production. In addition to intensifying wheat harvesting, most areas have begun weeding seedlings, and many areas are carrying out cotton field management work such as thinning, weeding, and preventing aphids. In Tancheng County, Linyi Special District, early corn has been weeded for the first time, and sorghum has been weeded for 35%; in Cangshan County, Linshu County, and other counties, large seedlings have been weeded for 80%; in Ju County, Yiyuan County, Mengyin County, and other counties, 50% have been weeded. Early millet has begun to be thinned. Weeding has generally begun in Jining Special District, with 300,000 mu having been weeded in Teng County, and more than 80% having been weeded in eight districts of Yi County. Many counties in this special district have promoted the close planting method in conjunction with thinning. In Teng County, sorghum was planted with 1,800 to 2,000 plants per mu last year, and this year it has been increased to 2,300 to 2,500 plants.
    Shandong farmers attach great importance to cotton field management this year. Cotton field management work in Tangyi County, Liaocheng Special District, has become a movement. From May 14th to 15th, 5,700 people in the first district of the county weeded more than 44,000 mu in two days; farmers in the second district weeded more than 200,000 jin of weeds in more than 189,000 mu of land. Farmers reported that weeding has four major benefits: first, it can completely eliminate insects; second, ten jin of weeds can equal one jin of cattle feed; third, it is easy to hoe and does not harm seedlings; fourth, it does not reduce fertilizer efficiency. In Cao County, Heze Special District, more than 30,000 mu of cotton have been infested with cotton aphids, with cotton plants containing aphids accounting for 50%. The county has mobilized more than 14,000 people to use tobacco water to control more than 3,100 mu. Farmers in Heze, Dingtao, and other counties in the special district have also begun to control cotton aphids. (Zhang Rong'an)

    山东省农民积极进行夏季生产
    山东省农民正积极进行夏季生产，除加紧麦收外，大部地区已开始锄苗，也有不少地区在进行间苗、除草、防蚜等棉田管理工作。临沂专区郯城县早玉米已锄了头遍，高粱已锄到百分之三十五；苍山县、临沭等县大苗已锄到百分之八十；莒县、沂源、蒙阴等县锄到百分之五十。早谷已开始间苗。济宁专区已普遍开始锄苗，滕县已锄完三十万亩，峄县八个区已锄到百分之八十以上。该专区很多县结合间苗推行了密植法，滕县高粱去年每亩种一千八百棵到两千棵，今年增加到两千三百棵到两千五百棵。
    山东农民今年很重视棉田管理工作。聊城专区堂邑县的棉田管理工作已形成运动。该县一区自五月十四日到十五日，两天时间里就有五千七百多人拔草四万四千多亩；二区农民在十八万九千多亩地里拔草二十多万斤。农民反映拔草有四大好：一、可以彻底灭虫；二、十斤草可顶一斤牛料；三、好锄地、不伤苗；四、不减低肥效。菏泽专区曹县有三万多亩棉花发生棉蚜虫，其中有蚜虫的棉棵占百分之五十。该县已发动一万四千多人用烟水防治了三千一百多亩。该专区的菏泽、定陶等县农民也开始防治棉蚜虫。　（张荣安）
