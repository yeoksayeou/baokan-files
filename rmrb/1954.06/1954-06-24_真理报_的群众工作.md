    "Pravda's" Mass Work
    Chen Jun
    "Pravda," the Central Committee organ of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, is the most widely circulated newspaper in the Soviet Union, maintaining extensive and close ties with the Party, government, organizations, and the broad masses. It has a daily circulation of 4.5 million copies. "Pravda" boasts a robust army of correspondents. In 1953 alone, "Pravda" received 400,000 letters and submissions from laborers, with an average of 30 to 40 people visiting daily (approximately 10,000 annually), and dispatching 1,000 to 1,500 letters daily. Each department of the "Pravda" editorial office unites dozens to hundreds of active writers, all authoritative figures in their respective fields and intimately familiar with their subjects. These include scientists, scholars, engineers, writers, artists, factory directors, advanced producers, collective farm chairmen, and leading Party and government cadres. "Pravda" also has a strong network of local reporters stationed in the capitals of the various union republics and autonomous republics, major provinces, regions, and industrial centers. Across the nation, "Pravda," with its local reporters at the core, unites activists, connects with local masses, and liaises with local Party organizations. The work of worker-peasant correspondents, laborers' letters, active writers, and local reporters constitutes "Pravda's" mass work. During our visit to "Pravda," we specifically experienced why mass work is the foundation of a Party newspaper's work. We also learned that "Pravda," precisely by following the principles of Party newspapers established by Lenin, under the ideological guidance of strengthening ties with the masses, and through the long-term, arduous, meticulous, in-depth, and creative work of the entire editorial department, has taken root among the masses, is intimately connected with the broad people, and unites millions around the Party.
    Before introducing "Pravda's" mass work, let's briefly clarify two issues.
    The first issue – how to distinguish between letter writers, correspondents, and active writers?
    Laborers' letters come from the broad masses; a reader who writes a letter may only write once, and such readers are not organized.
    The difference between correspondents and letter writers lies in the fact that correspondents are advanced elements among the masses. They care about the common cause of society, consciously cooperate with the newspaper, report good things, fight against bad phenomena, and view these as social obligations and expressions of patriotism. Therefore, correspondents are called "representatives of public opinion" and social activists. A person doesn't have to have their article published to be called a correspondent; someone who raises important issues with the newspaper can also be called a correspondent. Correspondents are organized around grassroots newspapers (wall newspapers, blackboard newspapers, and factory newspapers in enterprises and farms), and correspondent groups are directly led by these grassroots newspapers. The vast majority of correspondents are not permanently affiliated with any central or local newspaper; they can send their articles to a specific newspaper (wall newspaper, local newspaper, central newspaper, or specialized newspaper) based on the nature of the issue and their job position. Multiple submissions of the same article are not allowed.
    Active writers are of two types: one type emerges from correspondents, writing frequently and proactively; the other type includes writers, scholars, scientists, factory directors, engineers, and Party and government cadres. They are no longer "worker-peasant correspondents," so they are called active writers.
    The second issue – why distinguish between letter writers, correspondents, and active writers, and which is more important?
    Practice has proven that these three are distinct, but strict boundaries cannot be drawn. Letter writers can easily become active writers for the newspaper if their letters are properly handled, and correspondents can easily become active writers after being cultivated. The distinction is necessary for the convenience of the newspaper staff's work. However, "Pravda" has consistently opposed giving anyone titles like "active writer" and stipulates that the entire editorial department must work with letter writers, correspondents, and active writers every day. They are all objects of the newspaper's mass work, so it cannot be said that any one is more important than the others.
    I. The Worker-Peasant Correspondent Movement Laid the Mass Foundation for "Pravda"
    The worker-peasant correspondent movement emerged simultaneously with the Russian working-class newspapers. In 1905, under Lenin's leadership, the first openly published working-class newspaper, "New Life," was founded. More than half of the first page of each issue was dedicated to workers' correspondence. Between 1913 and 1914, "Pravda" published 11,000 letters and articles from workers. After the success of the October Revolution, the Soviet Communist Party attached particular importance to the worker-peasant correspondent movement, issuing multiple resolutions on worker-peasant correspondents and entrusting "Pravda" to lead the national worker-peasant correspondent movement. From 1923 to 1931, "Pravda" convened five national congresses of worker-peasant correspondents and working conferences. By the time of the 1931 working conference, the number of correspondents nationwide had grown to two million. "Pravda" also published periodicals such as "Worker Correspondent" and "Worker-Peasant Correspondent," as well as a monthly newspaper supplement, to guide and educate worker-peasant correspondents.
    Each national congress of worker-peasant correspondents discussed and stipulated the guiding principles and tasks of the worker-peasant correspondent movement at the time. These discussions and regulations, as well as the resolutions of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) concerning worker-peasant correspondents, still have practical significance for our current correspondence work. Their main contents are roughly threefold:
    1. Worker-peasant correspondents should be organized around the newspaper on a voluntary basis. They are selected by the newspaper and are not elected or appointed by any organization. Because elected or appointed correspondents would be subject to the control of a certain organization. However, the newspaper does not issue appointment letters or similar documents to correspondents, so as not to make them special figures among the worker-peasant masses.
    2. It is necessary to overcome the phenomenon of grassroots Party organizations being indifferent to worker-peasant correspondents, and also to prevent excessive restrictions on the worker-peasant correspondent movement. The Party's assistance and leadership of the correspondent movement should be manifested in strengthening communist education for worker-peasant correspondents, organizing political education work (groups, short-term training courses, clubs, congresses, etc.), and helping worker correspondents improve their professional skills. Party organizations in factories and rural areas should create favorable conditions for the correspondent movement, investigate the shortcomings revealed by correspondents, protect correspondents from persecution, and explain the importance of correspondent work to the broad masses. The Party's leadership of the worker-peasant correspondent movement must be carried out through Party members in the correspondent organizations, but not by establishing Party groups among the correspondents. Rather, the Party branch should listen to reports from Party members leading the work of correspondents, Party members participating in wall newspaper work, and Party members in the editorial board of factory newspapers and correspondent groups, and discuss the work tasks of the correspondents. Before carrying out important work with correspondents, such as convening a correspondent conference, the newspaper should consult with the Party organization, and the Party organization should also send representatives to participate in the conference.
    3. The political tasks of the worker-peasant correspondent movement are: (1) to educate correspondents to become active disseminators of the Party's policies in production and newspaper work, to improve their skills in their own work, and to become advanced workers; (2) to frequently expose shortcomings in work in the newspaper; (3) to widely publicize the achievements of socialism and promote the exchange of socialist construction experience; (4) to help the Party and government inspect the implementation of resolutions and instructions. Concerning these tasks, the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) made clear explanations in its 1931 resolution on reforming the worker-peasant correspondent movement, and further put forward new and more arduous tasks to worker-peasant correspondents. The resolution pointed out that if the main task of worker-peasant correspondents in the first period of the development of the worker-peasant correspondent movement was to expose and reveal "small" shortcomings of various organs, then the current worker-peasant correspondents should deeply study all the most important issues of socialist construction, universally expose shortcomings, and report the prominent advantages of socialist construction achievements in various construction departments (various teams, groups, workshops, factories, etc.). Worker-peasant correspondents are mass organizers in the cause of socialist construction and attacking class enemies. They should set an example among the working people, should be advanced producers, be exemplary in mastering advanced technology, and be promoters of advanced experience. The above-mentioned tasks of worker-peasant correspondents should be closer to their own production characteristics, not generalized, but more specialized. For example, worker correspondents in the coal mining industry should fight for the mechanization of coal mining, correspondents in the metallurgical industry should pay more attention to the production of blast furnaces and open hearth furnaces, and correspondents in collective farms should pay more attention to the issues of socialist labor organization and the superiority of collective production.
    "Pravda" does not adopt rigid forms in its contact, education, and training of correspondents, and strives to avoid all kinds of bureaucratic connections. They do not turn correspondents into newspaper staff members, and do not allow the tasks given by the newspaper to correspondents to interfere with their own work. "Pravda" does not issue any certificates to correspondents, nor does it force correspondents to carry out certain work or investigations. Instead, it establishes the most vivid and flexible contact methods based on the principle of voluntarism and in combination with the correspondents' own work tasks. In the past, "Pravda" has used many methods to guide the worker-peasant correspondent movement, such as publishing periodicals, launching wall newspaper competitions, holding newspaper exhibitions, organizing worker-peasant correspondent large-scale inspections, convening all-Soviet, regional, or enterprise-level correspondent congresses, forums, and publishing letters.
    "Pravda," under the support and assistance of Party organizations at all levels, led newspapers and wall newspapers at all levels in carrying out long-term, in-depth, and meticulous work for worker-peasant correspondents. "Pravda" cultivated an army of correspondents and made them the eyes and ears of the editorial department. From them, they could see the problems in the nation's life, hear the voices of the masses, and enable the newspaper to elaborate on the main problems in the daily lives of millions of workers and peasants, and to effectively explain the Party's policies to the masses in combination with their daily lives. At the same time, through the worker-peasant correspondent movement, "Pravda" absorbed the broad masses of workers and peasants to participate in newspaper work, and through the widespread development of the worker-peasant correspondent movement, it raised the masses' awareness of newspapers, making them truly regard Party newspapers as their own newspapers. When the newspaper issued a call, the masses responded enthusiastically. In February of this year, the newspaper published a letter from a young worker at the Stalin Automobile Factory volunteering to join the land reclamation team. Within three days, 25,000 people wrote to "Pravda" in response to this initiative. When correspondents have unsolvable problems in their work and life, they go to the newspaper they trust and actively put forward various suggestions. This is the source of "Pravda's" strength. Although with the improvement of the entire people's level of awareness and culture, and the progress of local newspapers and wall newspapers, "Pravda" no longer needs to advocate the worker-peasant correspondent movement and conduct unified leadership, and "Pravda" now has no roster of correspondents, nor does it need to continue to publish special publications to guide correspondents, but in reality, "Pravda" has an army of millions of correspondents, and through various tasks, it continues to absorb new masses to participate in newspaper work.
    II. Laborers' Letters (Including Visits) Work Attracts and Unites an Increasingly Large Number of Masses
    Whether the worker-peasant correspondent movement can be carried out and how fast it can be carried out is inseparable from whether the attitude towards the work of laborers' letters is correct. The broad masses are most likely to understand problems through facts. If we call on the masses to participate in the work of managing the country through the newspaper on the one hand, but on the other hand, we do not seriously and responsibly handle and support the proactive suggestions put forward by the masses, criticisms of shortcomings in work, appeals, and urgent demands for solutions, then all our political education for the masses and correspondents will become empty political talk. "Pravda" handles laborers' letters with an extremely serious and responsible attitude. All departments of the entire editorial department must handle letters and do not consider it a troublesome and extra thing. This marks the high degree of consciousness of the staff of the "Pravda" editorial department and profoundly understands Lenin's saying that laborers' letters are like a barometer, through which many errors in policy can be avoided. The "Pravda" editorial committee has made formal resolutions on the work of laborers' letters (including visits). One resolution pointed out that the editorial committee believes that letter work is an important work of the editorial department. Doing a good job in letter work can help the editorial department study mass sentiments, constantly raise new pressing issues that need to be resolved, improve the level of the newspaper, consolidate the connection between the newspaper and the masses, timely support criticisms from the masses, and help the Party correct shortcomings and errors in work.
    In "Pravda's" laborers' letters, the most important part is pointing out various unreasonable phenomena in the work of various departments, criticizing shortcomings, accusing bureaucratic phenomena, and asking for help in solving problems in work. This type of letter shows that the Soviet people regard the work of state organs as their own business in order to eliminate shortcomings in work, and put forward their own opinions and various proactive suggestions when they see unreasonable things. Part of the letters belong to reporting production achievements or putting forward various creative suggestions. The masses bring their achievements, experiences, and suggestions to the editorial department out of a pure heart to help socialist and communist construction. The newspaper must treat the suggestions put forward by the masses with a very kind and careful attitude. Even if some experiences and suggestions are not correct, the editorial department must give patient explanations with enthusiasm for caring for the masses; at the same time, after explanations, the letter writers' understanding is also improved. Some letters ask the newspaper to report more on the construction of people's democratic countries, publish what kind of theoretical articles, ask to explain the economic laws of socialism, and hope to report on the construction of a certain city and a certain project. These reflect the demands of the masses. There are also many letters about personal issues. Although they are personal issues, some are even very trivial, the editorial department must also help them solve them. Some personal problems may also become social problems. What seems to be a small problem is actually a big problem. At the same time, after the personal problems of the letter writers are resolved, these letter writers often establish contact with the newspaper from then on and become correspondents and activists of the newspaper.
    The "Pravda" editorial department believes that the work of laborers' letters is the initial stage of mass work, because it is aimed at people who are not organized. However, for people who write for the first time, if their letters can be handled patiently and answered in a timely manner, they may also become activists. Therefore, the newspaper editorial department must treat laborers' letters carefully, sensitively, and patiently, and carry out a serious struggle against bureaucracy in this work. Doing a good job in the work of laborers' letters can cultivate and unite thousands of correspondents to participate in the work of the Party newspaper.
    "Pravda's" experience tells us that the task of the laborers' letter department is to solve all the problems raised by laborers' letters. The purpose is to strengthen the connection between the newspaper and the masses, and to increasingly expand this connection, so as to unite more masses around the newspaper. But to achieve this goal, the newspaper must first care about the masses' personal problems and demands. This shows that serving the laborers is also serving the newspaper. Therefore, everyone who handles letters and receives visits in "Pravda" takes pride in the fact that their work can contribute to the Party newspaper. None of them are uneasy about this work.
    III. Organize Active Writers to Maintain the Newspaper's High Degree of Ideological and Scientific Nature
    Another important aspect of newspaper mass work is organizing and uniting active writers. The active writer team is necessary in order to maintain the newspaper's high degree of ideological and scientific nature. Generally speaking, the broad masses of correspondents understand life, but their level limits the depth of their understanding of problems. To raise the problems in life to a theoretical level and point out the regularity of a movement, it is necessary to absorb active writers with higher theoretical level, combat experience, and rich knowledge of life to participate in newspaper work.
    How does "Pravda" work with active writers?
    First, be good at discovering and organizing active writers.
    The large number of laborers' letters sent to "Pravda" raise many vivid and pressing issues every day. When the editorial department sees a letter raising an important issue, it will think of turning the letter writer into its own active writer. So it goes through its local reporters, local newspapers, or Party organizations to learn about this person. If he is an advanced producer or a knowledgeable person, the newspaper will contact him and absorb him as an active writer for the newspaper.
    When local reporters or editorial staff find a good article published in a wall newspaper or local newspaper, they go to learn about who wrote it. After learning about and educating the author, this person can also be absorbed as their own active writer. For example, the "Pravda" essay department pays attention to essays in major newspapers across the country. When it finds a good author, it develops him into an author for "Pravda's" essays through the local newspaper editorial department.
    Local reporters and editorial staff often participate in local Party congresses and other meetings. At the meetings, they find that some comrades are very concerned about the interests of the Party and the country, bravely expose shortcomings, and conduct criticism; or they find that some people have rich work experience, but they have never written anything for the newspaper. So they look for him and ask him to tell his honest criticism or work experience through the newspaper. In this way, an active writer who has never written for the newspaper is found.
    Localities often send representatives to Moscow to attend meetings. "Pravda" invites these representatives to the editorial department to talk and establish contact with them. Later, when they come to Moscow again, they will naturally come to "Pravda." "Pravda's" agricultural department used this method to develop a group of collective farm chairmen into active writers.
    Another effective method is to send people to factories, construction sites, and farms to establish personal contact with factory directors, engineers, and advanced producers, and absorb outstanding people to write articles for the newspaper. Although the industry, transportation, and trade departments of "Pravda" are very busy, they still try their best to send people out to organize active writers.
    "Pravda" also relies on local newspapers. In places where it does not have its own reporters, it asks the local newspaper to serve as a collective correspondent for "Pravda," responsible for organizing reports and articles for "Pravda," collecting materials, and conducting investigations. When a local reporter of "Pravda" returns to Moscow, his work is mostly replaced by the local newspaper editorial department.
    When organizing activists, first, pay attention to all aspects. "Pravda" is the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and needs to report on national affairs. If only a few activists are absorbed and they are always asked to write articles, the content of the newspaper will be monotonous. Among the active writers (writers) in the literature and art department of "Pravda," there are writers from Moscow, as well as writers from Leningrad, Kiev, Stalingrad, and various republics. Not only writers, but also playwrights, literary critics, music experts, filmmakers, and people's actors. Second, in terms of working methods, it is not appropriate to use meetings too much for active writers. It is best to conduct individual contact.
    Secondly, proactively and specifically help active writers write articles. It is not only necessary to be familiar with the situation of active writers and understand what problems they are studying; but before asking them to write articles, it is also necessary to find out their views and reach a consensus in understanding. Don't be afraid to argue in order to write a good article. The comrades of the literature and art department of "Pravda" told us that sometimes some writers strongly disagree with the opinions of the literature and art department on handling his articles. In this case, it should be submitted to the editorial committee for discussion and conclusion, or keep the original, or modify it. Articles written after such arguments are always better. In general, the articles of active writers must be discussed and revised multiple times by the editorial department and the author. Even for some famous writers and scholars whose articles are more mature, the editorial department often sends his articles to outside experts to read. For example, before writing the article "Production and Consumption under the Socialist System", the author (academician of the Academy of Sciences) was invited to discuss the outline together. After writing, it was jointly revised by the consultants and editors-in-chief of the propaganda department of Marxism-Leninism theory of "Pravda", and then sent to an agricultural economist, a master, and a doctor. A total of seven people participated in the discussion and revision before it was published.
    When encountering articles that need to be debated, "Pravda" often sends the articles to active writers first, and then organizes a forum for discussion. Before publishing the article "On the Antagonistic Nature of Contradictions", the Propaganda Department of Marxism-Leninism Theory sent the first draft of this article to six people, three of whom held opposing views, listened to their opinions, discussed them, and finally determined which point of view to write based on.
    Cultivating young authors is also an important task. The Propaganda Department of Marxism-Leninism Theory often designates a special person to help young authors who are not yet able to write articles for "Pravda" to write outlines and revise articles. The Literature and Art Department also pays attention to the long-term care and cultivation of young and talented scholars. For example, a famous literary critic now wrote an article for "Pravda" when he was in college. Since then, the Literature and Art Department has been in contact with him and helped him grow.
    IV. Local Reporters are "Pravda's" Agents Throughout the Soviet Union
    During our 50-day visit to "Pravda", we could feel the role of "Pravda's" local reporters almost every day. In the reports we heard, it was mentioned that local reporters are an important reliance for their work, and all departments must complete the most pressing tasks through local reporters, ask them to provide relevant materials, conduct investigations, and organize manuscripts. Wherever we went, such as Leningrad and Irkutsk, we could feel that "Pravda's" local reporters were very energetic, enjoyed high prestige, and could work locally on behalf of "Pravda." Of course, we also felt that being a local reporter for "Pravda" was a great responsibility, with many tasks, and the Party and "Pravda" gave him the greatest trust.
    The main task of local reporters can be explained by what Comrade Kurtanin, a Leningrad reporter for "Pravda", told us. He said that his task is to deeply understand the lives of the Party organizations in Leningrad Oblast and City, and the entire social life of the entire province and city. The reporter should become a link connecting the editorial department and the Leningrad Party organization, absorbing and reflecting everything good that happens in the province and city to the editorial department, and raising all the issues in the lives and work of Leningrad Oblast and City. These issues are the most interesting, or are what many people hope to solve. From some of the news and articles issued by "Pravda's" local reporters, we can clearly see how wide-ranging the things a local reporter cares about are. From Party congresses, new achievements in factories, the work of collective farms, the publication of new books, theater performances, to sports and chess competitions, he must know and report on everything most important and meaningful that happens locally. Several editors-in-chief told us that if a local reporter misses important local news, he will be severely criticized at the editorial department's flying meetings. Although the work of local reporters is a heavy task, it is not a task that cannot be done well. Local reporters need to have a certain political level and working ability, but more importantly, they must strengthen their Party spirit, recognize the importance of their work, be able to overcome difficulties, and consciously take on the glorious responsibility of being an agent of the newspaper editorial department.
    How do "Pravda's" local reporters complete their work tasks? Taking the Leningrad local reporter of "Pravda" as an example, relying on the full help of the local Party committee, he can participate in various meetings of the local Party committee, can talk to the secretaries of the provincial and municipal Party committees about reporting plans, solicit opinions, and understand the intentions of the provincial and municipal Party committees; the secretaries of the Party committees also often help reporters select the most meaningful topics at various meetings; he can also establish the widest possible communication with people from all walks of life locally. Through such relationships, he can quickly discover various situations and problems locally. The Leningrad reporter of "Pravda" told us: local reporters must often communicate with activists (Party cadres, writers, economic workers, and production innovators). Whether a reporter can do a good job, whether he has enough value, depends on the extent to which he comes into contact with people. For example, in order to report on the work of the Party, it is necessary to deeply understand the life problems of the Party organization, which requires not only communication with the leaders of the provincial and municipal Party organizations, but also communication with the secretaries of the district committees and many comrades of grassroots organizations. In order to report on industry, it is necessary to know many factory directors, engineers, designers, and production innovators. In short, it is necessary to establish close working relationships with people from all aspects of Leningrad. Only by doing this is it possible to understand practical problems, write meaningful problems into articles, and reflect various situations to the editorial department. This contact is not only for understanding the situation and collecting materials for reporters to write articles themselves, but also for reporters to select the best Party workers, factory directors, engineers, scholars, writers, and production innovators, and ask them to write articles and introduce their experiences. If he is the founder of an initiative, ask him to write an article to raise that issue. He cited an example, saying that there are many universities in Leningrad, and the provincial Party committee has experience in organizing the political study of university professors and students. Although the reporter himself can also write such articles, it is better to ask the comrade in charge of leading this work in the provincial Party committee to write it.
    The 1940 resolution of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the establishment of newspapers in provinces, border regions, and republics once pointed out that the main task of local reporters should be considered to be organizing the vast number of active writers outside the editorial department around the newspaper, and absorbing workers from Party organizations, Soviet organizations, and economic organizations, Soviet intellectuals, worker correspondents, and farmer correspondents to participate in the work. "Pravda's" local reporters have done just that. This is why Comrade Kurtanin, the Leningrad reporter of "Pravda," wanted to emphasize to us the reason why whether a reporter's work can be done well depends entirely on the work of activists and how well the mass work is done.
    × × ×
    From the above introduction of the work of worker-peasant correspondent movement, laborers' letters, active writers, and local reporters, we can more specifically and completely understand the mass work of "Pravda." Every staff member of the entire "Pravda" editorial department is working hard to absorb more masses to participate in newspaper work and attract them to participate in the work of managing the country. It is not difficult to understand that only by having such close contact with the masses can the tasks of the Party newspaper as a collective propagandist and collective organizer be realized. It is also possible to truly make the newspaper a bridge between the Party and the masses, and make the newspaper a powerful assistant to the Party. "Pravda's" experience also tells us that mass work is a long-term, arduous, meticulous, and specific work that requires the cooperation and mutual assistance of the entire editorial department. At the same time, mass work is not something that cannot be grasped or started. The key to doing a good job in mass work lies in the degree of consciousness of the staff of the editorial department regarding mass work, and whether they truly realize that mass work is a fundamental problem for the newspaper. If there are no broad laborers participating in newspaper work, it will cause the Party newspaper to lose the original appearance of the working-class newspaper.

    “真理报”的群众工作
    陈浚
    苏共中央机关报——“真理报”是苏联群众性最广泛的报纸，它和党、政府、机关团体以及广大群众有着极其广泛和密切的联系，每日发行四百五十万份。“真理报”有一支雄厚的通讯员大军。一九五三年全年，“真理报”接到四十万件劳动者来信来稿，每天平均有三十到四十人来访（全年一万人左右），每天要发出一千到一千五百封信。“真理报”编辑部各部，都团结了几十到一二百人的作者积极分子，这些作者积极分子都是全国各界最有权威，并且最熟悉他所写的东西的人，其中有科学家、学者、工程师、作家、文艺工作者、厂长、先进生产者、集体农庄主席以及党和政府的领导干部。“真理报”还有强大的地方记者网，散布在各加盟共和国、自治共和国的首都、主要的州、边疆区和工业中心。“真理报”在全国各地以地方记者为核心，团结积极分子，联系当地群众，联系各地党的组织。工农通讯员、劳动者来信、作者积极分子以及地方记者四个方面的工作，就构成了“真理报”的群众工作。在访问“真理报”的过程中，我们具体地体会到为什么群众工作是党报工作的基础。我们也了解到，“真理报”正是遵循着列宁所制定的党报的原则，在加强和群众联系的思想指导之下，经过全编辑部长期、艰苦、细致、深入和创造性的工作，使自己在群众中生了根，和广大人民息息相通，把千百万人团结在党的周围。
    在介绍“真理报”的群众工作之前，先简单说明两个问题。
    第一个问题——如何区分来信者、通讯员和作者积极分子？
    劳动者来信是来自广大群众之中，一个来信的读者可能就来一次信，来信的读者是没有组织的人。
    通讯员和来信的读者的区别，就在于通讯员是群众中的先进分子。他们关心社会的共同事业，自觉地和报纸合作，把好事情告诉报纸，和坏现象作斗争，并把这些看成是社会的义务和爱国主义的表现。所以，通讯员被称为“社会舆论的代表者”、社会活动家。不一定登出稿件的人才叫通讯员，向报纸提出重要问题的人，也可以叫通讯员。通讯员是组织在基层报纸（企业和农庄的墙报、黑板报和厂报）周围的，通讯员小组直接受基层报纸的领导。广大通讯员不固定属于中央和地方的哪一个报纸，他们可以根据所写问题的性质和工作岗位的不同，把稿件寄给某一个报纸（墙报、地方报、中央报或各专业的报纸），不能一稿数投。
    作者积极分子有两类，一类是从通讯员中涌现出来的，他们写得多和写得主动；另一类是作家、学者、科学家、厂长、工程师、党和政府的干部。他们已不是“工农通讯员”，所以叫做作者积极分子。
    第二个问题——为什么要区别来信的读者、通讯员和作者积极分子，哪个更重要一些？
    从实践中证明，这三者是有区别的，但又不能划出十分严格的界限；来信者在他的来信被恰当地处理，通讯员在经过培养后，都很容易成为报纸的作者积极分子；所以需要区别，是为了报纸工作人员工作的方便。但是“真理报”一直反对给予任何人以作者积极分子等称呼，又规定全编辑部每天必须向来信者、通讯员和作者积极分子做工作，他们都是报纸的群众工作对象，所以不能说三者哪一个更重要一些。
    一、工农通讯员运动为“真理报”奠定了群众基础
    工农通讯员是和俄国的工人阶级报纸同时出现的。一九○五年，在列宁领导下创办了第一个公开出版的工人阶级的报纸“新生活”报，每期报纸的第一版上，有一半以上是工人的通讯。一九一三年到一九一四年当中，“真理报”就刊登了一万一千件工人的来信来稿。苏联共产党在十月革命成功以后，特别重视开展工农通讯员运动，曾经多次作出关于工农通讯员的决议，并且委托“真理报”领导全国工农通讯员运动。从一九二三年到一九三一年，“真理报”召开了五次全国工农通讯员代表大会和工农通讯员工作会议，到一九三一年举行工农通讯员工作会议时，全国通讯员已发展到二百万人。“真理报”并先后出版过“工人通讯员”、“工农通讯员”等刊物以及一月一次的报纸专页，指导和教育工农通讯员。
    每次全国工农通讯员的代表大会，都对当时工农通讯员运动的方针任务作过讨论和规定。这些讨论规定以及联共（布）中央所作的有关工农通讯员的决议，对于我们今天的通讯工作还有它的现实意义。它们的主要内容大致有三方面：
    一、工农通讯员要按自愿的原则组织在报纸周围。他们是由报纸来选拔的，不由任何组织来选举或任免。因为选举或任命的通讯员，就要受某个组织的支配。但报纸不发给通讯员任命状一类的文件，不使他们变为工农群众之中特殊的人物。
    二、要克服基层党组织对工农通讯员漠不关心的现象，也要防止对工农通讯员运动的过分的限制。党对通讯员运动的帮助和领导，应表现在对工农通讯员加强共产主义的教育，组织政治教育的工作（小组、短期训练班、俱乐部、代表大会等），以及帮助工人通讯员提高业务。工厂和农村的党组织应为通讯员运动创立有利条件，调查通讯员所揭发的工作中的缺点，保护通讯员不受迫害，向广大群众解释通讯员工作的重要意义。党对工农通讯员运动的领导，一定要通过通讯员组织中的党员来进行，但不是在通讯员中成立党的小组，而是党的支部应听取领导通讯员工作的党员、参加墙报工作的党员、工厂报纸编辑委员会和通讯员小组中的党员汇报工作，讨论通讯员的工作任务。报纸在对通讯员进行重要工作之前，如要召开通讯员会议时，要和党的组织研究，党组织也派代表参加会议。
    三、工农通讯员运动的政治任务是：（1）教育通讯员使之成为生产中和报纸工作中的党的政策的积极传达者，提高其对本身业务的技能，成为先进工作者。（2）经常在报纸上揭露工作中的缺点。
  （3）广泛宣传社会主义的成就，展开社会主义建设经验的交流。（4）帮助党和政府检查决议指示执行的情况。关于这些任务，在一九三一年联共
  （布）中央关于革新工农通讯员运动的决议中，又作了明确的解释，并进一步向工农通讯员提出新的更繁重的任务。决议中指出，如果在发展工农通讯员运动的第一时期，工农通讯员的主要任务是暴露和揭发各机关的“小的”缺点，那么目前的工农通讯员，就应该深刻地研究社会主义建设的一切最重要的问题，普遍揭发缺点，报道各建设部门（各班、组、车间、工厂等）社会主义建设成绩的显著优点。工农通讯员是社会主义建设事业和向阶级敌人进攻中的群众组织者。他们应该在劳动人民中作出榜样，应该是先进生产者，是模范地掌握先进技术的人，和先进经验的宣传者。要使工农通讯员的上述各种任务更加接近于自己的生产特点，不要一般化，要更专业化一些。如采煤业的工人通讯员要为采煤机械化而斗争，冶金工业的通讯员要更多注意高炉平炉的生产情况，集体农庄的通讯员要更多注意社会主义劳动组织的问题和集体生产的优越性。
      “真理报”对通讯员的联系、教育和培养，不采用死板的形式，并且竭力避免各种官僚主义的联系。他们不把通讯员变成报纸的工作人员，不使报纸所给予通讯员的任务，妨碍了他们本身的业务工作。“真理报”不发给通讯员任何证件，也不勉强通讯员去进行某项工作或调查，而是按自愿原则，和通讯员自己的工作任务相结合，建立最生动和最灵活的联系方式。“真理报”在过去曾采用出版刊物，发起墙报竞赛，举办报纸展览，组织工农通讯员大检查、召开全苏的、一个地区的或一个企业单位的通讯员代表大会、座谈会，以及刊登来信等许多方法，来指导工农通讯员运动。
   “真理报”领导各级地方报纸和墙报，在各级党组织的支持和帮助下，对工农通讯员进行了长期的、深入的、细致的工作。“真理报”培养起一支通讯员大军，并且使它成为编辑部的耳目。从他们那里，可以看到全国生活中的问题，听到群众的声音，使报纸有可能阐述千百万工人农民日常生活中的主要问题，有可能结合群众的日常生活，向群众有效地解释党的政策。同时，通过工农通讯员运动，“真理报”吸收了广大工农群众参加报纸工作，并通过工农通讯员运动的广泛开展，提高了广大群众对报纸的认识，使他们把党报真正看成是自己的报纸，报纸上一有号召，群众就热烈响应。今年二月间，报上发表了斯大林汽车工厂一个青年工人志愿参加开荒队的来信，三天内就有二万五千人投书“真理报”，响应这一创举。通讯员在工作中和生活中有了解决不了的问题，就去找他所信任的报纸，并且积极提出各种建议。这就是“真理报”力量的源泉。虽然随着整个人民觉悟程度和文化水平的提高，以及地方报纸和墙报工作的进展，不再需要“真理报”倡导工农通讯员运动，进行统一的领导，“真理报”现在也没有什么通讯员的名册，也不必继续出版专门指导通讯员的刊物，但是实际上，“真理报”却有一支成百万的通讯员大军，并且通过各种工作，继续不断吸收新的群众参加着报纸工作。
    二、劳动者来信（包括来访）工作吸引和团结着日益众多的群众
    工农通讯员运动能不能开展以及开展的快慢，是和对待劳动者来信工作的态度正确与否分不开的。广大群众是最容易通过事实来认识问题的，如果我们一方面号召群众通过报纸参加管理国家的工作，而一方面对于群众提出的积极性建议、对工作缺点的批评、提出的申诉和迫切要求解决的问题，却不去认真负责地处理和给予支持，那么我们对群众对通讯员的一切政治教育，就会变成政治空谈。“真理报”是以极其严肃负责的态度处理劳动者来信的。全编辑部各部都要处理来信，不认为是一件麻烦和额外的事。这标志着“真理报”编辑部工作人员的高度自觉性，并且深刻理解列宁所说的劳动者来信如同晴雨表，通过它可以避免政策上的许多错误。“真理报”编辑委员会对于劳动者来信（包括来访）工作，作过正式的决议。在一次决议中指出：编辑委员会认为来信工作是编辑部的重要工作。把来信工作做好，就可以帮助编辑部研究群众情绪，不断提出新的迫切需要解决的问题，提高报纸的水平，巩固报纸和群众的联系，及时支持来自群众的批评，帮助党改正工作中的缺点和错误。
    “真理报”劳动者来信中，最主要的一部分是指出各地各部门工作中种种不合理的现象，批评缺点，指责官僚主义现象，要求帮助他们解决工作中的问题。这一类来信，说明了苏联人民为了消灭工作中的缺点，把国家机关的工作看成是自己的事情，看到了不合理的事情，就提出自己的意见和各种积极的建议。一部分来信是属于报道生产成绩或者提出的各种创造性的建议。群众把自己的成绩、经验、建议提到编辑部来，是出于一种帮助社会主义共产主义建设的纯洁的心，报纸必须以十分亲切细心的态度来对待群众提出的建议。即使有些经验和建议并不正确，编辑部也必须以爱护群众的热情，给予耐心的解释；同时经过解释，也提高了来信者的认识。来信中也有向报纸提出各种要求和问题的，比如要求报纸多报道人民民主国家的建设，刊载什么样的理论文章，要求解释社会主义的经济法则，希望报道某一城市某一工程的建设，这些都反映了群众的要求。来信中也有不少是关于个人问题的。虽则是个人问题，有些甚至是很琐碎的，但编辑部也要帮助他解决。而有些个人问题，也可能变成社会问题，看来是个小问题实际上是个大问题。同时，在处理了来信者的个人问题后，这些来信者往往就从此和报纸建立了联系，成为报纸的通讯员和积极分子。
    “真理报”编辑部把劳动者来信工作，认为是群众工作的最初阶段的工作，因为这是以没有组织的人为对象的。但是，对于第一次来信的人，如果能耐心地处理他的来信，及时地给他回答，他也可能成为积极分子。因此，报纸编辑部要细心地、敏感地、耐心地对待劳动者来信，并和这一工作中的官僚主义作严肃的斗争。做好劳动者来信工作，就可以培养和团结成千的通讯员来参加党报工作。
    “真理报”的经验告诉我们，劳动者来信部的任务就是要解决劳动者来信所提出的一切问题。其目的是为了加强报纸和群众的联系，日益扩大这种联系，以便把更多的群众团结在报纸周围。但要达到这一目的，就必须报纸首先关心群众的切身问题和要求。这说明，为劳动者服务，也就是为报纸服务。因此，在“真理报”处理来信和接待来访的每一个人，都以自己的工作能对党报有所贡献而引以为荣。他们之中是没有不安心这一工作的。
    三、组织作者积极分子，保持报纸的高度思想性和科学性
    报纸群众工作的另一个重要方面，就是组织和团结作者积极分子。作者积极分子队伍之所以必要，是为了使报纸保持高度的思想性和科学性。一般的说，广大通讯员了解生活，但他们的水平限制了他们理解问题的深刻程度。要把生活中的问题提高到理论上来，指出一种运动的规律性，就需要吸收有更高的理论水平、斗争经验和丰富的生活知识的作者积极分子，来参加报纸工作。
    “真理报”是怎样对作者积极分子进行工作的呢？
    首先，要善于发现和组织作者积极分子。
    寄到“真理报”的大批劳动者来信，每天都提出许多生动和迫切的问题。编辑部看到一件提出重要问题的来信，就会想到把来信者变成自己的作者积极分子。于是通过自己的地方记者、地方报纸或者党组织，去了解这个人。如果他是一个先进生产者或者有学识的人，报纸就和他发生联系，吸收他成为报纸的作者积极分子。
    地方记者或编辑部工作人员，发现某一个墙报或地方报纸上刊登了一篇好文章，就去了解这是谁写的。经过了解和对作者进行教育，也可以把这个人吸收为自己的作者积极分子。例如“真理报”小品文部就注意全国主要报纸的小品文，发现了好的作者，就通过地方报纸编辑部，把他发展为“真理报”小品文的作者。
    地方记者和编辑部工作人员，经常参加各地党代表会议和其他会议。他们在会上发现有的同志十分关心党和国家的利益，勇敢地揭发缺点，进行批评；或者发现有的人有丰富的工作经验，但是他却从来没有给报纸写过东西。于是就找他，请他把自己的正直的批评或工作经验，通过报纸讲出来。这样，就找到了一个从来没有给报纸写过稿件的作者积极分子。
    各地经常派代表到莫斯科来开会，“真理报”就请这些代表到编辑部来谈话，和他们建立联系。以后他们再来莫斯科，就自然会到“真理报”来。“真理报”的农业部就是用这种方法，把一批集体农庄主席发展为作者积极分子的。
    还有一种有效的方法，就是派人到工厂、工地、农庄中去，和厂长、工程师、先进生产者建立个人联系，吸收优秀的人物给报纸写文章。“真理报”的工业、运输和贸易部虽然工作很忙，仍想尽办法派人到外面去组织作者积极分子。
      “真理报”还依靠地方报纸，在没有自己记者的地方，请当地报纸担任“真理报”的集体通讯员，负责为“真理报”组织报道和文章，搜集材料，进行调查。“真理报”某一地方记者回莫斯科时，他的工作也多由地方报纸编辑部代替。
    在组织积极分子时，第一，要注意各个方面。“真理报”是苏共中央的机关报，要报道全国的事。如果只吸收少数积极分子，老是请他们写文章，报纸的内容就单调了。“真理报”文学和艺术部的作者积极分子（作家）中，有莫斯科的作家，也有列宁格勒、基辅、斯大林格勒以及各共和国的作家。不但有作家，并且有戏剧家、文艺批评家、音乐方面的专家、电影工作者以及人民演员。第二，在工作方式上，对作者积极分子不宜多采用开会的方法，最好是进行个别联系。
    其次，要主动、具体帮助作者积极分子写文章。不但需要熟悉作者积极分子的情况，了解他正在研究什么问题；并且在约他写文章之前，还先要弄清楚他的观点，取得认识上的一致。为了写好一篇文章，不要怕争论。“真理报”的文学和艺术部的同志告诉我们，有时候有的作家对文学和艺术部处理他的文章的意见坚决不同意，在这种情况下，就要提交编辑委员会去讨论，作出结论，或者保持原作，或者进行修改。经过这样争论写出来的文章，总是比较好的。对于作者积极分子的文章，一般都要经过编辑部和作者多次商量和修改。就是有些有名的作家和学者，文章写得比较成熟，编辑部也常常要把他的文章送给外面的专家去看。如“社会主义制度下的生产和消费”一文，在写作之前，就请了作者（科学院院士）来一起商定提纲，写好后，经过“真理报”马克思列宁主义理论宣传部的顾问和主编共同修改，以后又送给一个农业经济学家、一个硕士、一个博士看了。前后一共有七个人参加讨论和修改，最后才见报。
    遇到要展开争论的文章，“真理报”常先把文章发给作者积极分子，然后组织座谈会，进行讨论。马克思列宁主义理论宣传部在发表“关于矛盾的对抗性”的文章之前，就把这篇文章的初稿发给六个人，其中有三个是抱着反对观点的人，听他们的意见，进行讨论，最后再确定究竟应该根据哪一个观点来写。
    培养青年作者，也是一项重要的工作。马克思列宁主义理论宣传部，对于有些目前还不能给“真理报”写文章的青年作者，常常指定专人帮助他们写出提纲，修改文章。文学和艺术部也注意对年轻的有天才的学者，进行长期的关怀和培养。如现在一个有名的文艺批评家，他在大学时曾给“真理报”写过一篇文章，以后，文学和艺术部就一直和他有联系，帮助他成长。
    四、地方记者是“真理报”在全苏联各地的代理人
    我们在“真理报”访问的五十几天中，几乎每天都能感到“真理报”地方记者的作用。我们所听的报告中，都提到地方记者是自己工作的重要依靠，所有的部，都要通过地方记者去完成最迫切的任务，要他们供给有关的材料，进行调查，组织稿件。我们所到之处，如列宁格勒、伊尔库次克，都可以感到“真理报”的地方记者是非常有活力的，他们享有很高的威信，能以代表“真理报”在当地进行工作。当然，我们也感到当一个“真理报”的地方记者，责任重大，任务繁多，以及党和“真理报”给予他的最大的信任。
    地方记者的主要任务，可以“真理报”列宁格勒记者库尔塔宁同志告诉我们的话来说明。他说，他的任务就是深刻了解列宁格勒州和市的党组织的生活，全州和全市的全部社会生活。记者要成为联系编辑部和列宁格勒党组织的一个环节，把州和市里所发生的一切好事情都吸收反映到编辑部去，提出列宁格勒州和市的生活和工作中的一切问题，这些问题是最使人感兴趣的，或者是很多人所希望解决的。我们从“真理报”地方记者所发出的一些消息和文章中，就可以清楚地看到，一个地方记者所关心的事情是多么广泛，从党的代表大会，工厂的新成就，集体农庄的工作，新书的出版，剧院的演出，一直到体育、棋赛，凡是当地所发生的一切最重要和最有意义的事件，他都要知道，并且进行报道。好几个部的主编告诉我们，如果哪一个地方记者漏掉了当地的重要消息，就会在编辑部的飞行集会上受到严厉的批评。地方记者的工作虽是一件繁重的工作，但也并不是一种不能做好的工作。地方记者需要有一定的政治水平和工作能力，但是更重要的，就是要加强自己的党性锻炼，要认识自己工作的重要意义，能以克服困难，自觉地担负起报纸编辑部代理人的光荣责任。
      “真理报”的地方记者怎样完成自己的工作任务呢？以“真理报”列宁格勒地方记者为例，他依靠当地党委的全力帮助，可以参加当地党委的各种会议，可以找州委、市委书记谈报道计划，征求意见，了解州委、市委意图；党委书记也经常在各种会议上，帮助记者挑选最有意义的题目；他也可以和当地各界人士建立最广泛的交往，通过这样的关系，迅速发现当地的各种情况和问题。“真理报”列宁格勒记者告诉我们：地方记者必须经常和积极分子（党的干部、作家、经济工作者、生产革新者）交往。一个记者能不能做好工作，他有没有足够的价值，决定于他和人们接触的广泛程度。比如为了报道党的工作，就要深刻了解党组织的生活问题，这就不但要和州、市党组织的领导人有交往，并且也要和区委书记以及许多基层组织的同志有交往。为了报道工业，就要认识很多厂长、工程师、设计师、生产革新者。总之，要和列宁格勒各方面的人都建立工作上的密切联系。只有做到这一步，才可能了解实际问题，把有意义的问题写成文章，向编辑部反映各种情况。这种接触，不光是为的了解情况、搜集材料、记者自己写文章，而且是为的使记者能以选择出最好的党的工作者、厂长、工程师、学者、作家、生产革新者，请他们写文章，介绍自己的经验。如果他是发起某一种创议的创始人，就请他写文章来提出那个问题。他举例说，列宁格勒的大学校很多，州委在组织大学教授和学生的政治学习上是有经验的。这样的文章，记者自己虽则也可以写，但是不如请州委负责领导这个工作的同志写更好。
    联共（布）中央一九四○年关于州、边疆区和共和国的报纸的编制的决议中曾经指出：地方记者的主要任务，应认为是把编辑部以外的广大作者积极分子组织在报纸周围，吸收党组织、苏维埃组织和经济组织的工作人员、苏维埃知识分子、工人通讯员和农民通讯员参加工作。“真理报”的地方记者，正是做到了这一点。这也就是“真理报”列宁格勒记者库尔塔宁同志所以要强调地告诉我们，记者工作能不能做好，全看积极分子的工作，群众工作做得如何的理由。
    ×  ×  ×
    从上面所介绍的工农通讯员运动、劳动者来信、作者积极分子和地方记者四个方面的工作中，我们就能比较具体和完整地了解“真理报”的群众工作。“真理报”全编辑部每个工作人员，都是为吸收更多的群众参加报纸工作，吸引他们参加管理国家的工作而努力着。不难理解，只有和群众有了如此密切的联系，才可能实现党报的集体宣传者和集体组织者的任务。也才可能真正使报纸成为党和群众之间的桥梁，使报纸成为党的有力的助手。“真理报”的经验也告诉我们，群众工作是需要全编辑部分工合作、互相帮助来进行的长期的、艰苦的、细致的、具体的工作。同时，群众工作也不是什么捉摸不到、无从下手的工作。做好群众工作的关键，在于编辑部工作人员对于群众工作的自觉程度，在于是否真正认识到：群众工作对于报纸是个根本问题，如果没有广大劳动者参加报纸工作，就会使党报失去工人阶级报纸的本来面貌。
