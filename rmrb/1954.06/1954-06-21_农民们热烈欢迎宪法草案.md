    Represents the Wishes of the Peasants
    On June 15th, a group of peasants in Zhangqing Village, Yuci County, Shanxi Province, held two small meetings during their morning and midday breaks to enthusiastically discuss and study the draft constitution. During lunchtime, the village broadcaster also broadcast the news of the publication of the draft constitution to all the villagers. In just over half a day, a wave of publicity and discussion about the draft constitution quickly swept through this large village of 515 households.

    During the discussions, the peasants of Zhangqing Village unanimously agreed that the draft constitution expressed the wishes of the peasants and was in line with their own interests. When everyone studied Articles 7 and 8 of the draft constitution, which stated that the state encourages, guides, and helps peasants to organize and develop production, and guides the vast number of peasants to take the road of agricultural collectivization, the peasants participating in the discussion naturally thought of the benefits of organizing and the help that the people's government had given to the entire village in recent years, as well as the state's plan to establish a state-owned tractor station in Zhangqing Village to help peasants cultivate the land. Cui Bazi said, "What else is there to say? Since liberation, our entire village has organized to develop production and has already received many benefits. Last year, the village averaged 324 jin of grain per mu, wasn't that thanks to the fact that more than 80 percent of the villagers were organized?"

    The Joy of Elderly Peasants
    Male and female members of the Xiaowangzhuang Vegetable Production Cooperative in Jinan, Shandong, read the draft constitution in groups after lunch in the cool doorways and under the willows by the paddy fields. Wang Pengde, the director of the cooperative, said, "Every article of the draft constitution represents the interests and demands of the people. It stipulates the protection of the property of cooperatives, encourages, guides, and helps the development of the cooperative economy, and also stipulates a policy of restricting and gradually eliminating the rich peasant economy, which guarantees that our lives will get better and better!" Wang Hongxin, the vice-director, was very old and had no children, often worrying about who would care for him in his old age. After hearing the provisions of Article 93 of the draft constitution, he said with emotion, "The publication of the draft constitution has dispelled my concerns of many years. The state takes care of the elderly laborers, and I will work even harder." Other members quickly added, "In the old society, working people were fired when they got old, and no one cared if they starved to death; in the new society, the government plans for the working people in every way, how happy the elderly are now!" Female members, thinking of the happiness that the people's government had brought to women since liberation, Feng Yaolan said, "The draft constitution stipulates that women in the People's Republic of China enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social, and family life, and our women's rights are guaranteed!"

    Guo Rong is Determined to Do Two Things Well
    Before liberation, the knife handle was in the hands of the landlords and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and they used tricks to exploit the people. Guo Rong, director of the Zhangguozhuang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengtai District, Beijing, was a middle peasant with 26 mu of hillside land before liberation, but he had to pay more than 2,000 jin of grain in various exorbitant taxes to the reactionary government every year. His family of eleven worked from before dawn until late at night for a year, but they could only barely get enough to eat, there was really no way to survive. After liberation, the power of the landlords and the Kuomintang reactionaries was overthrown, and he was able to turn over a new leaf, his life was guaranteed, and he only paid more than 200 jin of patriotic public grain to the state every year. Last year, he organized a cooperative, and his family's income doubled again, and life became more and more prosperous. Today's fruits of victory have already been written into the draft constitution, and no one dares to encroach on them again.

    The draft constitution also stipulates that the state encourages peasants to take the road of collectivization for common prosperity. Taking the Zhangguozhuang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengtai District, Beijing, as an example, the income of 21 of the 34 members increased more than twofold last year, and they sold more than 35,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. The villagers saw that this path was good and rushed to sign up to join. This year, their cooperative has expanded to more than 380 households. Right now, the wheat in their cooperative has also had a bumper harvest. It is estimated that more than 60,000 jin of wheat will be handed over in patriotic public grain and collectively sold to the state. Some members are also preparing to sell their surplus wheat to the state.

    From the draft constitution, the cooperative director Guo Rong and the members have a clearer picture of the prospects for a happy life in a socialist society, and they want to use practical actions to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance and are determined to do the following two things well: First, help and unite the mutual aid groups, and lead the individual farmers to do a good job in production together, and gradually attract them to participate in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups; Second, step up production to support the state's socialist industrial construction, and strive to sell more than 200,000 jin of surplus grain and more than 300,000 jin of oil crops to the state after the autumn harvest.

    Our Rights are Guaranteed
    Zhao Jinbao, a peasant in Xincheng District, Hohhot City, had many things in his heart that he wanted to say after listening to the publicity about the draft constitution.

    Article 8 of the draft constitution stipulates: The state protects all the rights that peasants should enjoy in accordance with the law. This inevitably reminded him of his experiences during the era of reactionary rule. From the age of sixteen, he rented the vegetable garden land of landlords, and for twenty-three years, he suffered countless indignities. Once, he planted more than thirty mu of barren dry land belonging to the landlord Qi Jun, with an agreement to plant for ten years. Although the land was barren and dry, farmers had the strength, and as long as they worked hard, they could still get a harvest. He pulled all the manure he had accumulated to the land, but there was a shortage of water, so he looked for water in this field, and only found water when he dug the eighteenth well, and stubbornly turned the dry land into irrigated land. After all this hard work, the land was finally brought into good condition. But after five years, the landlord forced him to return the land with several foreign-saber-wielding and pistol-carrying puppet military officers. Later, he rented the vegetable garden land of several other landlords, and was similarly deprived of the land and driven away by the landlords.

    He compared his past suffering with his life today and said:
   "After liberation, I was given land, and I also joined the mutual aid group, and life is getting better day by day. Now the draft constitution also stipulates the protection of our peasants' rights, and we are even more at ease in production! I must take the lead in increasing production, set an example for the peasants who have not yet joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and lead them to take the road of common prosperity."

### 农民们热烈欢迎宪法草案

    农民们热烈欢迎宪法草案
    代表了农民的心愿
    六月十五日山西省榆次县张庆村的一部分农民在上午和中午的歇晌时间，举行了两次小型的会议，热烈地讨论和学习了宪法草案；吃中午饭时，村上的广播员又向全村农民广播了宪法草案公布的消息。半天多的时间，宣传和讨论宪法草案的浪潮，便迅速地在这个拥有五百一十五户人家的大村子里掀起来了。
    张庆村的农民在讨论中，一致认为宪法草案表达了农民的心愿，都符合自己的利益。当大家学习到宪法草案第七条和第八条国家鼓励、指导和帮助农民组织起来发展生产并引导广大农民走农业集体化的道路时，参加讨论的农民都自然地联想起组织起来的好处和近几年来人民政府对全村农民的帮助，以及国家即将在张庆村建立国营拖拉机站帮助农民种地的事情。崔八子说：“还有什么可说的呢？解放以来，我们全村农民组织起来发展生产，已经得到了许多好处。去年全村每亩地平均打三百二十四斤粮食，还不是沾了全村百分之八十以上的农民都组织起来的光吗？”
    老年农民的喜悦
    山东济南小王庄蔬菜生产合作社的男女社员们，吃罢午饭就在凉快的大门过道里、稻田边的柳荫底下，分组阅读宪法草案。社长王朋德说：“宪法草案的每一条，都代表了人民的利益和要求。它规定着保护合作社的财产，鼓励、指导和帮助合作社经济的发展，又规定了对富农经济采取限制和逐步消灭的政策，这便保障了咱们的日子越过越好！”副社长王鸿鑫年纪很大了，没有子女，常愁着没人养老，他听了宪法草案第九十三条的规定，感慨地说：“宪法草案一公布，打消了我多年的顾虑。国家照顾劳动的老年人，我干活就更有劲了。”其他社员连忙补充说：“在旧社会劳动人民老了被开除，饿死也没有人管；新社会，政府处处为劳动人民打算，如今的老人们多幸福！”女社员们联想到解放后人民政府给妇女带来的幸福，冯耀兰说：“宪法草案上规定中华人民共和国妇女在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭的生活各方面享有同男子平等的权利，咱们妇女的权利有保障了！”
    郭荣决心做好两件事
    解放以前，刀把子握在地主、国民党反动派手里，他们耍着花招宰割老百姓。北京丰台区张郭庄乡农业生产合作社主任郭荣，解放前是一个有二十六亩山坡地的中农，可是一年缴纳给反动政府的各种苛捐杂税就得要两千多斤粮食。他全家十一口人起五更睡半夜地劳动一年，也只能混个半饱，真是一点活路也没有。解放以后，推翻了地主和国民党反动派的政权，他才翻了身，生活有了保障，每年给国家缴的爱国公粮只二百多斤。去年他组织了合作社，全家的收入又增加了一倍，日子越过越富裕。今天的胜利果实都已经写在宪法草案上，谁也不敢再侵占了。
    宪法草案还规定，国家鼓励农民走大家共同富裕的合作化道路。拿北京丰台区张郭庄乡农业生产合作社来说，去年三十四户社员中就有二十一户收入增加一倍以上，他们卖给国家的余粮有三万五千多斤。乡亲们瞧着这条道儿好，都争先报名参加，今年他们合作社就扩大到三百八十多户了。眼下他们社里的小麦又获得了丰收。交纳爱国公粮和集体出售给国家的小麦，估计要有六万多斤。有些社员还准备把自己吃不了的小麦卖给国家。
    从宪法草案中，合作社主任郭荣和社员们更瞧清楚了社会主义社会幸福生活的远景，他们要用实际行动来加强工农联盟，决心做好下面两件事情：第一，帮助和团结互助组，带动单干户，共同搞好生产，逐步吸引他们参加农业生产合作社和互助组；第二，加劲生产，支援国家社会主义工业建设，争取秋后卖给国家二十多万斤余粮，三十多万斤油料作物。
    咱们的权利有了保障
    呼和浩特市新城区农民赵金宝听了关于宪法草案的宣传，有许多心里的话，只想往外涌。
    宪法草案第八条规定：国家依照法律保护农民的一切应享权利。这使他不由地想起在反动派统治时代的遭遇。他从十六岁起就租种地主的菜园子地，二十三年中，不知受了多少窝囊气。有一次种了地主祁骏的三十多亩荒了的旱地，讲好种十年。地虽荒旱，庄稼人有把子力气，只要勤拾弄点一样有收成。他把积下来的粪都拉到地里了，可就是缺水，他就在这块田里找水，一直打到第十八眼井时，才见着水，硬把旱地变成水地。下了这些辛苦，才把地拾弄得像样了。可是到五年头上，地主叫几个挂洋刀和匣子枪的伪军官硬逼着他退了地。后来他又租过几个地主的菜园子地，都同样被地主夺了地、把他撵走。
    他把过去的苦日子和今天的生活对比一下说：
  “解放后，我分到了土地，又参加了互助组，生活一天比一天好起来。现在宪法草案又规定保护咱们农民的权利，生产上就更安心啦！我一定要带头增加生产，给未参加互助合作组织的农民做个样子，带动他们走大家富裕的道路。”
