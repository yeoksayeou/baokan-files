Further Consolidation and Development of Mutual Aid and Cooperation Organizations in Shandong Province

Mutual aid and cooperative organizations in Shandong Province have been further consolidated and developed during the spring production. The number of agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province has increased from 15,422 at the beginning of the spring production in March this year to 20,581. There are now 500,874 permanent mutual aid teams and 526,406 temporary mutual aid teams in the province. The number of peasant households organized has increased from 53.68 percent of the total number of peasant households last year to 62.558 percent at present.

At the beginning of this year's spring production, the CPC committees at all levels in Shandong Province attached importance to the leadership of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, especially the work of rectification and consolidation of newly established cooperatives last winter and this spring. Many Party committees have held representative conferences on mutual aid and cooperation and have run training courses for key members of mutual aid and cooperation. The county committees under the Heze Prefectural Committee have run 22 training courses for key members of mutual aid and cooperation. Since the beginning of spring, the district committees of Laiyang Prefectural Committee have held three to four joint meetings of heads of agricultural producers' cooperatives. Since the beginning of spring, the county and district committees of Jining Prefectural Committee have taken the initiative, assigned responsibilities, seized the base points, created experience, held meetings on key issues, and issued circulars at any time to conduct specific leadership. The county committee members of each county are directly connected with one cooperative and one team. In addition to the county committee members being responsible for one cooperative, Jining County also organized special forces to conduct巡回 inspections to help solve problems and disseminate experience. Each district committee member of Qixia County in Laiyang area directly controls one cooperative and one team, and the general party branches of each township also have their own base point cooperatives and key teams, and the village party branches of the Communist Party also control the key cooperatives. The general branch committee members and branch committee members take the groups and cooperatives they participate in as the key points, forming core groups and cooperatives, exchanging experience in stages, and promoting the whole township and village.

In the process of spring production, the Party committees at all levels have solved the problems of business management of agricultural producers' cooperatives by leading production, helping agricultural producers' cooperatives to formulate plans, grasping the key to production, arranging agricultural work, and rationally using labor. The Zibo Special Committee has adopted the following methods in rectifying and improving new cooperatives: 1. Further implement the general line education, improve the socialist consciousness of cooperative members, and carry out the production increase competition movement. 2. Grasp the spring agricultural production, democratically formulate annual production targets and small-segment production plans, so that cooperative members have a clear idea and establish the idea of cooperative members being masters of their own affairs. 3. In the process of actively carrying out production, closely integrate with improving business management. For example, Zhang Ronghe Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bixiang Township, Zichuan County, carried out summary appraisal by checking the completion of the production plan, cultivated activists, elected the cooperative affairs committee, formulated a small-segment production plan, studied the method of recording work points, and adopted the method of clearing the land and reporting accounts every five days, avoiding the phenomenon of many meetings at night. The cooperative members are in high spirits for production, and the land originally planned to be plowed in 20 days was plowed in 15 days. 4. In order to complete the production plan, in addition to educating the cooperative members and organizing the strength of the cooperative members, it is also necessary to seize the key to increasing production, carry out technical reforms, do a good job in production, and set an example. Due to the above measures, the spring production of all 38 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the district was both good and fast this year. At the same time, each cooperative often brings three to five mutual aid teams, and the mutual aid team leaders are also absorbed when the agricultural producers' cooperatives study production plans, farming techniques, and work point evaluation methods. For example, Wang Yuyang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangjiazhuang, Boshan, led 17 mutual aid teams to formulate production plans, and the plowing was one to two fingers deeper than last year. The members of the mutual aid team said: "We will follow the cooperative wherever it goes." Many mutual aid teams have requested to join the agricultural producers' cooperative or establish a new cooperative. (Zhang Rong'an)

    山东省互助合作组织进一步巩固发展
    山东省互助合作组织在春季生产中，得到进一步的巩固和发展。全省农业生产合作社已由今年三月春季生产开始时的一万五千四百二十二个，发展到二万零五百八十一个。全省现在有常年互助组五十万零八千七百四十五个，临时互助组五十二万六千四百零六个。全省组织起来的农户已由去年占总农户的百分之五十三点六八发展到现在的百分之六十二点五五八。
    今年春季生产开始，中共山东各级党委就重视了对互助合作组织的领导，特别是重视了对去冬和今春新办社的整理和巩固工作。许多党委都召开过互助合作代表会议，开办了互助合作骨干训练班。菏泽地委所属的各县县委就开办了二十二期互助合作骨干训练班。莱阳地委的各区委入春以来召开过三次到四次农业生产合作社长联席会议。济宁地委的各县、区党委入春以来亲自动手，分工负责，抓住基点，创造经验，在关键性的问题上召开会议，随时印发通报，进行具体领导。各县县委委员都直接和一个社一个组发生联系。济宁县除县委委员分工掌握一个社以外，还专门组织力量巡回检查，帮助解决问题和传播经验。莱阳地区栖霞县的每个区委委员都直接掌握一个社和一个组，各乡中共总支也有自己的基点社、重点组，中共村分支委员会也掌握了重点社。中共总支委员和分支委员都以自己参加的组和社为重点，形成核心组社，按段交流经验，推动全乡全村。
    在春季生产过程中，各级党委都通过领导生产，帮助农业生产合作社订计划、抓生产关键、进行农活排队、合理使用劳力等来解决农业生产合作社的经营管理问题。淄博特委在整顿和提高新社中采取了以下几种办法：一、进一步贯彻总路线的教育，提高社员社会主义觉悟，开展增产竞赛运动。二、抓住春季农业生产，民主制订全年生产指标和小段生产计划，使社员心中有数，树立社员当家思想。三、在积极进行生产过程中，紧密结合改善经营管理。如淄川县笔锡乡张荣和农业生产合作社，通过检查生产计划的完成情况，进行了总结评比，培养出积极分子，选举了社务委员会，制订了小段生产计划，研究出记工评工办法，采取了地头清、五天一报账，避免了晚上开会多的现象。社员生产情绪很高，原计划二十天刨完的地，十五天就刨完了。四、为了完成生产计划，除对社员进行教育和组织社员力量外，还要抓住增产关键进行技术改革，搞好生产，树立样子。由于上述措施，全区三十八个农业生产合作社，今年春季生产既好又快。同时，每个合作社还经常带着三个到五个互助组，农业生产合作社研究生产计划、耕作技术和评工记工方法时，都吸收互助组长参加。如博山王家庄王玉杨农业生产合作社，带动十七个互助组订出生产计划，刨地比去年深一指到两指。互助组员们说：“社走到那里咱跟到那里。”许多互助组都要求参加农业生产合作社或建立新社。（张荣安）
