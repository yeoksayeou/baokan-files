Agricultural labor models Wu Chun'an, Lü Hongbin, Chen Yongkang, Geng Changsuo, Chen Yike, Kang Juying, Luo Guangming, and others, all nationally renowned, have written letters to rural senior primary and junior high school graduates who will be graduating this summer, welcoming them to engage in agricultural production after graduation and to contribute their strength and wisdom to the socialist transformation of agriculture.

Wu Chun'an, director of the Wu Chun'an Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiliang Village, Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, and winner of the Patriotic丰产 (bumper harvest) Gold Star Medal, described in his letter the situation of senior primary and junior high school graduates engaged in agricultural production in the Wu Chun'an Agricultural Production Cooperative, and how the Communist Party, the People's Government, the Communist Youth League, and all cooperative members cherish and cultivate them. He hopes that senior primary and junior high school graduates will resolutely and cheerfully bring their cultural knowledge to the agricultural production front. Luo Guangming, an agricultural labor model from Anhui Province, said in his letter: The Party has shown infinite concern and care for everyone who is willing to work actively. Because of the Party's kind care and cultivation, Luo Guangming was sent to the Soviet Union and Beijing and met the great revolutionary teacher Stalin and our leader Chairman Mao. Last year, he also participated in the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to慰问 (express sympathy to) our most beloved people in Korea. In his letter, he expressed his welcome to senior primary and junior high school graduates to come to the agricultural production front and actively engage in agricultural production according to the needs of the motherland.

Chen Yike, a special-class agricultural labor model from Jiangxi Province, pointed out in his letter that the development of agricultural production requires a group of educated young people. He wrote in his letter: "We are often distressed because we cannot understand a book, cannot read a newspaper, and cannot improve ourselves quickly... If we had someone in our cooperative with a senior primary school education or higher, how much convenience would that bring to our cooperative's production!" Kang Juying, a special-class agricultural labor model from Hunan Province, described in her letter the difficulties of lacking accounting personnel when the mutual aid group was transformed into a production cooperative last year. Later, she found an accountant from another village, but unfortunately, he was the accountant, the clerk, the people's school teacher, and the radio operator. She wrote in her letter: "Production cooperatives will expand every year, and the need for people with cultural and scientific knowledge will become even greater and more urgent." Geng Changsuo, director of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Raoyang County, Hebei Province, cited the example of deputy director Qiao Liguang in his letter: Qiao Liguang engaged in agricultural production after graduating from senior primary school. He is in charge of the entire cooperative's production, carefully makes production plans, draws production charts,划耕作区 (delineates cultivation areas), and leads all cooperative members in learning new scientific knowledge and technology. He has become the backbone of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative. Although Qiao Liguang undertakes such heavy work, he has not given up learning. He uses all his spare time to constantly study cultural and scientific knowledge, so his cultural level is improving day by day. Geng Changsuo said in his letter: Comrades, the socialist transformation of the country's agriculture is calling you, and various construction tasks are waiting for you. I hope you will study hard and prepare to take on the glorious post of the country's construction. (Xinhua News Agency)

    农业劳动模范吴春安等纷纷写信给高小和初中毕业生
    欢迎他们从事农业的社会主义改造事业
    全国著名的农业劳动模范吴春安、吕鸿宾、陈永康、耿长锁、陈翊科、康菊英、罗光明等，纷纷写信给今年暑期将毕业的农村高小和初中毕业生，欢迎他们毕业后从事农业生产，把自己的力量和智慧贡献给农业的社会主义改造事业。
    山西省翼城县西梁村吴春安农业生产合作社社长、爱国丰产金星奖章获得者吴春安在信中介绍了吴春安农业生产合作社的高小和初中毕业生从事农业生产的情形，和共产党、人民政府与青年团以及全体社员爱护、培养他们的情形。他希望高小和初中毕业生坚决愉快地带着他们的文化知识到农业生产战线上来。安徽省农业劳动模范罗光明在信中说：党对每个肯积极劳动的人，都表示了无限的关怀和爱护。罗光明由于党亲切的爱护和培养，曾被派到苏联和北京，见过伟大的革命导师斯大林和我们的领袖毛主席。他去年又参加了中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团，到朝鲜慰问了我们最可爱的人。他在信中表示欢迎高小和初中毕业生到农业生产战线上来，根据祖国的需要，积极地从事农业生产。
    江西省特等农业劳动模范陈翊科在信中指出，发展农业生产需要一批有文化的青年。他在信中写道：“我们常常因为看不懂一本书，念不了一张报纸，不能很快地提高自己而苦恼……如果我们社里有个高小以上文化程度的人，那对我们社里的生产会带来多少方便啊！”湖南省特等农业劳动模范康菊英在信中叙述去年互助组转为生产合作社时缺乏会计人员的困难情形，后来从外乡找到了一个会计，但可惜会计是他，文书是他，民校教师是他，收音员也是他。她在信中写道：“生产合作社年年要扩大，需要有文化科学知识的人也就更多，更迫切。”河北省饶阳县耿长锁农业生产合作社社长耿长锁在信中举出副社长乔利广的例子：乔利广在高小毕业以后就从事农业生产。他掌握全社的生产，精心作生产计划，画生产图，划耕作区，领导全体社员学习新的科学知识和技术，他已成为耿长锁农业生产合作社的支柱了。乔利广虽然担任这样繁重的工作，可是并没有放弃学习。他利用一切空闲时间始终不间断地学习文化和科学知识，因此他的文化水平一天天在提高着。耿长锁在信中说：同学们，祖国农业的社会主义改造事业在召唤你们，各项建设工作在等待你们，希望你们努力学习，准备着走上祖国建设事业的光荣岗位。（新华社）
