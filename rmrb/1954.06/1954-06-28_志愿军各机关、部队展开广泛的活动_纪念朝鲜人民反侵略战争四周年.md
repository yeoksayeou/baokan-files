Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 27th: The organs and units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (CPV) commemorated the fourth anniversary of the Korean People's Anti-Aggression War.

    In addition to sending a delegation to Pyongyang on the 24th to congratulate the heroic Korean people on the great victories they have achieved in the struggle against American aggression and in post-war reconstruction, the leading organs of the CPV broadcast an article written by Li Zhimin, Deputy Political Commissar of the CPV, on the morning of the 25th from the CPV Political Department's broadcasting room to the cadres and soldiers of the leading organs, commemorating the fourth anniversary of the Korean People's Anti-Aggression War. In the evening, the CPV Political Department held a film evening, screening the Korean film "Young Guerrillas."

    In the central sector, before "June 25th," the leading organs of a certain unit of the CPV sent representatives and film projection teams and basketball teams to a certain unit of the Korean People's Army (KPA) to express their regards. A certain unit of the CPV in the Shangganling area also sent representatives and film projection teams to the local Korean government and people on the 25th to express their regards. The leading organs of a certain unit of the CPV stationed in the Cheorwon area held a commemorative meeting. Local Korean people also sent fifty-two representatives, bringing fresh vegetables to express their regards to the CPV troops stationed in this area, and commemorated "June 25th" together with the CPV troops. After the meeting, they also went to the CPV Martyrs' Cemetery to lay flowers and pay their respects. The CPV troops who are helping the Korean people build a middle school in Pua-ri also held a commemorative meeting with local Korean residents and students.

    In the western sector, the cadres of the leading organs of a certain unit of the CPV and the representatives of the General Political Bureau of the KPA jointly held a commemorative meeting. In their speeches, representatives of the CPV and the KPA unanimously congratulated the great victory that had been achieved in the anti-aggression struggle, and pointed out that the recent actions of the American delegation at the Geneva Conference to obstruct and disrupt the conference, preventing a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, further exposed the aggressive face of the United States. The people of Korea and China must continue to strengthen their unity and friendship, remain vigilant at all times, and strive to the end for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    Many organs and units of the CPV guarding the west coast of Korea also carried out extensive commemorative activities.

At the symposium, the soldiers of this squad recalled the kindness of Park Chang-ok, the mother of Kim Jae-hwan, the captain of the Anju Young Guerrilla unit in Korea, in taking care of them, and expressed with emotion: They must continue to carry forward the spirit of internationalism and better help the Korean people rebuild a peaceful life. The commanders and fighters of the fifth company of a certain unit, which was awarded a special-class merit, jointly held a commemorative meeting with the local Korean workers and students. At the meeting, the Korean workers sincerely thanked the Chinese people for the assistance they had given to the Korean people and expressed that they would certainly work harder to improve production efficiency.

    纪念朝鲜人民反侵略战争四周年
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】中国人民志愿军各机关、部队纪念朝鲜人民反侵略战争四周年。
    中国人民志愿军领导机关除在二十四日派出代表团前往平壤祝贺英雄的朝鲜人民在反对美国侵略和进行战后恢复建设工作中取得的伟大胜利外，二十五日清晨，志愿军政治部的播音室又向领导机关的干部、战士转播了志愿军副政治委员李志民写的一篇纪念朝鲜人民反侵略战争四周年的文章。傍晚，志愿军政治部举行了电影晚会，放映了朝鲜影片“少年游击队”。
    在中线，志愿军某部领导机关在“六·二五”前，派出代表和电影放映队、篮球队到朝鲜人民军某部进行慰问。上甘岭地区的志愿军某部，也在二十五日派出代表和电影放映队向当地朝鲜政府和人民进行慰问。驻在铁原地区的志愿军某部领导机关举行了纪念大会。当地的朝鲜人民也派出五十二名代表，带着新鲜蔬菜慰问驻在这个地区的志愿军部队，和志愿军部队一起纪念“六·二五”。会后，他们并到志愿军烈士墓献花致敬。正在浮鸭里帮助朝鲜人民修建一所中学的志愿军部队，也和当地朝鲜居民、学生举行了纪念会。
    在西线，志愿军某部领导机关的干部和人民军总政治局的代表联合举行了纪念会。志愿军和人民军的代表在讲话中都一致庆贺已取得的反侵略斗争的伟大胜利，并指出最近美国代表团在日内瓦会议上采取了阻挠和破裂会议的手段，使朝鲜问题得不到和平解决，这更进一步暴露了美国的侵略面目。朝中两国人民必须继续增强团结和友谊，时刻提高警惕，为朝鲜问题的和平解决而奋斗到底。
    守卫在朝鲜西海岸的志愿军的许多机关、部队，也进行了广泛的纪念活动。某部第九连第四班曾在爱民工作中荣立三等功。在座谈会上，这个班的战士们回忆起朝鲜安州少年游击队队长金在焕的母亲朴昌玉亲切照顾他们的情形，都激动地表示：一定要继续发扬国际主义精神，更好地帮助朝鲜人民重建和平的生活。荣立特等功的某部第五连的指挥员、战斗员们和驻地的朝鲜工人、学生联合举行了纪念会。会上，朝鲜工人衷心地感激中国人民给予朝鲜人民的援助，并表示一定更加努力提高生产效率。志愿军的指挥员、战斗员们也表示要更加努力协助朝鲜人民进行恢复重建工作。
