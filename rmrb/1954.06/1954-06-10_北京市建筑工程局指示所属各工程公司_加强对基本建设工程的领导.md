    Beijing Municipal Bureau of Construction Engineering Directs Subordinate Construction Companies to Strengthen Leadership over Basic Construction Projects

    From January to mid-May this year, 86 construction sites in Beijing have commenced operations under the leadership of various construction companies affiliated with the Municipal Bureau of Construction Engineering. The construction area reached 706,046 square meters, accounting for 51.98% of the total annual task.

    Although this year's basic construction tasks are more arduous than last year's (many buildings are high-rise mixed structures with more complex decorations and higher technical requirements), thanks to the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Construction Engineering and various construction companies undertaking much work in adjusting organizational structures, establishing responsibility systems, improving planning and technical management, and promoting piece-rate wages, the construction sites have basically overcome the chaos and idleness phenomena that occurred during the initial stages of construction.

    However, there were still many shortcomings in the work during the first quarter. The balancing of the annual plan was not well done, labor dispatch was too frequent, work plans were not fully implemented, and construction management failed to adapt to objective requirements.

    In order to ensure the completion of 35% of the annual task in the three months of May, June, and July, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Construction Engineering has issued instructions requiring the leadership of subordinate companies to strengthen work plans, implement piece-rate wages, and actively mobilize all employees to launch a production increase and economy drive. The instructions point out that construction units with a good foundation and that have already begun to implement work plans must improve and consolidate their monthly work plans and project task sheets, and gradually strengthen the division of work plans by ten-day periods and by day. Construction units with a poor foundation and that have not yet implemented work plans should first focus on establishing monthly work plans and project task sheets. Each construction company should improve and consolidate the administrative responsibility system (responsibility system for construction site directors, foremen, and functional departments), oppose the idea of neglecting planning, organize the masses to study and promote advanced experience, and launch a production increase and economy drive. In terms of promoting the piece-rate wage system, construction sites with a good foundation, that have already implemented work plans and project task sheets, and that have better cadre conditions can first conduct pilot projects in order to gain experience and gradually promote it. Other construction sites can actively implement over-quota bonus measures to create conditions for the full implementation of the piece-rate wage system; and implement reward measures for management personnel at all levels to encourage everyone to quickly improve and enhance various management tasks.

    北京市建筑工程局指示所属各工程公司
    加强对基本建设工程的领导
    从今年一月到五月中旬，北京市已有八十六个工地在市建筑工程局所属各建筑工程公司领导下开工。建筑面积达七十万六千零四十六平方公尺，占今年全年任务的百分之五一点九八。
    虽然今年的基本建设任务比去年繁重（许多建筑物都是高层混合结构，装修比较复杂，技术要求较高），由于北京市建筑工程局以及各工程公司在调整组织机构、建立责任制、提高计划、技术管理以及推行计件工资等方面，进行了许多的工作，各工地基本上克服了开工初期的混乱和窝工现象。
    但在第一季度工作中，尚存在很多缺点。年度计划的平衡工作没有做好，劳动力调度过繁，作业计划还未全面推行，施工管理未能适应客观的要求等。
    为了保证在五、六、七三个月中完成全年任务的百分之三十五，北京市建筑工程局已发出指示，要求所属各公司领导方面加强作业计划，实行计件工资，积极发动全体职工开展增产节约竞赛运动。指示中指出，基础较好，并已开始推行作业计划的工程单位，必须健全、巩固月作业计划和工程任务单，并逐步加强按旬分日作业计划。基础较差，尚未推行作业计划的工程单位，应首先抓紧建立月作业计划及工程任务单。各工程公司应该健全与巩固行政责任制（工地主任、工长、职能部门的责任制），反对不重视计划的思想，组织群众学习推广先进经验，开展增产节约竞赛。在推行计件工资制方面，基础较好，已经实行作业计划与工程任务单、干部条件较好的工地，可首先进行试点，以便取得经验，逐步推广。其他工地可积极实行超额奖励办法，为全面实行计件工资制创造条件；并实行各级管理人员奖励办法，以鼓励大家迅速改进与提高各项管理工作。
