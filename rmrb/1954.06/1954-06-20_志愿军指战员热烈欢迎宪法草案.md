    【新华社平壤十九日电】在横贯朝鲜半岛非军事区北缘的阵地上和各海防阵地上，中国人民志愿军各部队中都传布着“中华人民共和国宪法草案公布了”的喜讯。许多有收音机的机关、部队，每天都注意收听中央人民广播电台关于宪法草案的广播。许多部队的政治部门也把宪法草案全文印发到各连队。
    当宪法草案公布的消息传到了上甘岭地区，警惕地守卫在这一带英雄阵地上的志愿军指挥员、战斗员们，就像传捷报一样地立刻把这件大喜事传开了。战士们纷纷发表感想，庆祝宪法草案的公布。正在和朝鲜人民一道重建沙里院市的志愿军指挥员、战斗员们，听到宪法草案公布的消息以后，工地上马上就沸腾起一片欢呼声。某团一营的政治教导员柯学明向全营战士作了宪法草案的讲解，并号召大家提前完成修建任务，以庆祝宪法草案的公布。
    志愿军的指挥员、战斗员衷心地拥护宪法草案。刚从祖国慰问人民解放军回到朝鲜的志愿军某部二级英雄李国海听到这个消息后兴奋地说：“我亲眼看到伟大祖国的各项建设成就，宪法草案将巩固革命的成果，并保证祖国过渡到社会主义社会。”某部荣立一等功的连长张美虎说：“这个宪法草案，是我国第一个属于人民的宪法草案。”某部战士胡生是僮族人，他在看到宪法草案的当天夜里，便激动地写下了自己的感想：宪法草案中明确规定了少数民族的自治权利，并且帮助各少数民族发展经济、政治和文化的建设事业。我坚决拥护宪法草案。某部医疗队的女医生和女护士们在座谈宪法草案时，对于宪法草案规定保护妇女的合法权利，感到特别兴奋。女护士郭蟾明说：“今后我们应该更好地履行自己的义务，在伟大的抗美援朝斗争中贡献自己的力量。”
