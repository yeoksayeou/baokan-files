　　Most provincial and municipal People's Courts have focused on piloting the first-instance jury system. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of May, more than 42,000 fixed jurors had been elected through democratic elections in various regions. When electing jurors, People's Courts in various regions generally combined it with local central work to explain to the broad masses of people why the jury system should be established, the powers and tasks of jurors, the benefits of the jury system to the people, and who can be a juror. Some areas also organized people to conduct full discussions before holding elections. The broad masses of people generally reflected that before liberation, poor people dared not enter the court, but now they can be elected as jurors to sit side-by-side with the court comrades to hear cases, truly becoming masters of the country. The people's jurors carefully elected by the people are all fair-minded. According to statistics from the First, Third, and Tanggu Districts of Tianjin, workers and their families accounted for more than 80 percent of the 462 jurors elected.
　　Jurors have close ties with the broad masses of people and are familiar with local conditions, which is of great help to the handling of cases after they participate in the jury. The jurors of the Third District of Xi'an City assisted in the investigation of 138 cases related to the general election in the general election, and most of the investigated materials were correct; many jurors seriously put forward opinions on a few cases of being wrongly deprived of the right to vote and wrongly granted the right to vote, so that these cases were corrected in time. Luo Kailun and Luo Ziqin, residents of Ganzhou City, Jiangxi Province, had a dispute over support issues. After the street people's mediation committee failed to mediate, the People's Court accepted the case and it was heard by juror Wang Longhui; because Wang Longhui understood the situation, he pointed out Luo Ziqin's erroneous behavior of not supporting his father Luo Kailun during the jury, and listed many specific examples, making it impossible for Luo Ziqin to deny it. As a result, the dispute was resolved in just half an hour. In the Second District of Tieling County, Liaoxi Province, there were two cases of clearing accounts in a mutual aid group, which had been entangled for more than half a year without being resolved. Later, with the active efforts of the jurors, the facts of the case were quickly clarified, and the problem was solved in a trial of one and a half hours.
　　People's Courts in various regions also pay attention to training jurors. Some areas hold short-term training courses, and some organize report meetings to explain policies and how to be a good people's juror to the jurors. Some areas also organize people's jurors to observe the trial of typical cases. Du Xiumin, a people's juror in Tanggu District, Tianjin, said after watching the trial of a typical case: The day I was elected as a juror, I always thought to myself that I am a housewife, how can I do a good job in jury work? Through this study, my work confidence has been improved, and I think I can do a good job in jury work. (Xinhua News Agency)

    大多数省市人民法院已重点试建一审陪审制
      全国大多数省、市人民法院已有重点地试建了一审陪审制。据不完全统计，到五月底，各地已通过民主选举方法选出固定陪审员四万二千多人。各地人民法院在选举陪审员时，一般都结合当地中心工作，对广大人民讲解为什么要建立陪审制、陪审员的职权和任务、陪审制对人民有什么好处和什么人才能做陪审员等问题。有些地区还组织人民进行充分讨论，然后进行选举。广大人民普遍反映：解放前穷人不敢进法院，现在可以被选为陪审员来和法院同志并坐审案子，真是作了国家的主人了。由人民认真选举出来的人民陪审员都是办事公正的人。据天津市一区、三区和塘沽区的统计，当选的四百六十二个陪审员中，工人及其家属占百分之八十以上。
    陪审员和广大人民有密切联系，熟悉当地情况，他们参加陪审以后对案件的处理有很大帮助。西安市第三区的陪审员在普选中协助调查了一百三十八件有关普选的案件，调查的材料绝大部分是正确的；不少陪审员对于少数被错误剥夺选举权和错误给予选举权的案件严肃提出意见，使这些案件及时得到了正确的处理。江西省赣州市居民罗开伦和罗梓琴因扶养问题发生了纠纷，经街道人民调解委员会调解未成，人民法院受理了这一案件，由陪审员王隆惠陪审；由于王隆惠了解情况，陪审时指出了罗梓琴不扶养他父亲罗开伦的错误行为，并列举了许多具体事例，使罗梓琴无法抵赖，结果只用半小时就把纠纷解决了。辽西省铁岭县二区有一个互助组内有清点账目案两起，纠缠了半年多没有得到解决。后经陪审员的积极努力，迅速弄清了案情，在一个半小时的审判中就把问题解决了。
    各地人民法院还注意对陪审员进行训练。有的地区举办短期训练班，有的组织报告会，向陪审员讲解政策以及怎样当好人民陪审员等问题。有的地区还组织人民陪审员观摩典型案件的审判。天津市塘沽区人民陪审员杜秀敏在观摩了典型案件的审判后说：我当选为陪审员的那一天，老是想我自己是个家庭妇女，怎能作好陪审工作呢？通过这次学习，提高了我的工作信心，我想我是可以做好陪审工作的。　（新华社）
