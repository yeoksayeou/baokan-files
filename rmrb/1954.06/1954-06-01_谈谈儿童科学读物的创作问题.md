    On the Creation of Children's Science Books
    Gao Shiqi

    As I write this article, I recall events from twenty years ago. At that time, I co-founded the Children's Science Correspondence School in Shanghai with Mr. Tao Xingzhi and began my writing career. I remember Mr. Tao telling me at the time: "Writing popular articles is like speaking; every word and every sentence must be colloquial." Although this instruction was not comprehensive or profound, it did give me great inspiration at the time. Later, I read Ilin's early books, such as "Ten Thousand Whys," "What Time Is It?", "Black and White," "The City That Never Sleeps," and "The Story of the Five-Year Plan." I felt that Ilin's works were rich in content, lively in language, active in thought, and short in paragraphs, and I resolved to learn from Ilin.

    From then until the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, I wrote many science essays, which were published in magazines such as "Reading Life" and "Women's Life." Later, some of them were compiled into separate books, such as "Bacteria and Humans," "Resistance and Epidemic Prevention," and "Autobiography of a Germ."

    After liberation, I returned to Beijing. I had been troubled by illness for a long time, and writing and speaking had become difficult for me. I could only write short poems as science fairy tales, which were published in "Chinese Young Pioneers" magazine. "Our Mother Soil" was written at this time. In recent years, although I have written some science poems and essays for children, I am ashamed to say that my efforts have been insufficient. Recently, many young readers have written to me saying that they are willing to dedicate themselves to writing children's science books. This is such an exciting thing! To commemorate "June 1st" International Children's Day, I would like to discuss the creation of children's science books based on my past writing experience for readers' reference.

    First of all, we should understand the purpose of writing children's science books, that is, the question of why we write.

    Everyone knows that our country is currently striving to achieve socialist industrialization. The work of every department is carried out around this great goal. The creation of children's science books is also the same. We also know that in a socialist society, everyone needs to have scientific knowledge. Science has already entered our lives and has become an indispensable part of our daily lives. If people want to win in life and production struggles, they must gradually master scientific knowledge from childhood. Aren't today's children the builders and defenders of socialism tomorrow? Aren't they the new reserve labor force?

    The task of children's science books is to educate children to arm themselves with the knowledge of life and production struggles, and to teach them to understand and transform nature. For example, now that summer has arrived, we should teach children to pay attention to summer food and environmental hygiene, so that they understand some knowledge of preventing gastrointestinal infectious diseases, which is very important for public health and people's health. Also, we should tell children the story of steel, because steel is the foundation of the industrial base. Promoting the steel industry is to educate children to recognize the greatness of the working class, and to make them love labor and the socialist construction cause.

    Second, there is the issue of the content of children's science books, that is, the question of what to write.

    The field of scientific knowledge is very broad: from atoms to the universe, from microorganisms to humans, from deserts to oceans, from the outer atmosphere of the earth to the mineral deposits inside the earth, from the origin of life to labor creating humans, from stone tools to modern machines, from agriculture to medical and health care, etc., all can be discussed. As Ilin said: "Every science seems to be calling us, inviting us to specialize in writing about it. Everywhere there are piles of the most valuable new materials that literature has not yet touched. Everywhere is marked with roads that the pens of writers have not yet traveled." (Ilin: "On Children's Science Books," published by China Youth Publishing House)

    In this situation, what should we consider?

    1.  Write about the science we are familiar with. If we ourselves lack a deep understanding of the subject, then it is impossible to explain the principles clearly, and the reader will be even less likely to understand. Ilin is right: "Poor narration is often a direct result of vague understanding." (Ilin: "Talking About Science") Recently, I wrote a "Story of Steelmaking" for the May issue of "Youth Literature." At the beginning, I was very worried that I would not write well, because I was not very familiar with the steelmaking process, although I had read several books on the steel industry; later, I dared to write only after I personally went to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to experience it.

    2.  Write about the knowledge that children urgently need. This requires us to combine scientific knowledge with children's daily lives and write about the things around them. For example, in Ilin's works, he writes about notebooks, pencils, teacups, knives, shirts, clocks, electric lights, cars, and airplanes, all of which are things around children. If we write about the principles of "cosmic rays" or Einstein's "theory of relativity" for children, it will be too far from them and exceed their ability to accept it.

    3.  The writing plan should not be too large. If the scope is too wide, it will cause many difficulties, and it will be difficult to express vivid and concrete details.

    4.  We must promote a materialistic worldview to children. We must make children feel that nature is a whole. There is a connection between everything, and one science is not isolated from another.

    5.  We must guide children to go to science laboratories, so that they can understand the life and work of scientists and encourage their enthusiasm for learning scientific knowledge.

    6.  It should be emphasized that we must also educate children to value labor. Our children's science books must not be like children's science books in capitalist countries, which simply pursue fun or novelty. Our children's science books are aimed at millions of future laborers. Therefore, we must guide them on how to fight against nature and overcome nature.

    If we do this, I believe that our children's science books will introduce the most important and interesting materials in science into the field of literature more and more every day, and make science more and more popular among the people.

    Third, there is the issue of the writing method of children's science books, that is, the question of how to write.

    The author of children's science books should be someone who loves science and also loves literature and art. He must be scientifically trained, able to collect rich scientific materials, and know how to analyze, research, and organize these materials. He must be an artist of language. He not only understands children's language, understands children's psychological characteristics and thoughts and feelings, but also can express many complex and mysterious things simply and clearly in children's common language, making it attractive. Children's science books should be lively, accessible, and approachable, not only enlightening children's intellect but also arousing children's emotions. Therefore, its creative form should be diverse, and most of it should be literary, and it should never be a monotonous advertising-style text and a boring old textbook.

    The author of children's science books must be faithful to the history of science. He must fight against all phenomena that distort the history of science, such as attributing the invention of the electric light to Edison alone, and saying that the invention of the radio was Marconi, forgetting Popov.

    In addition, we must also pay attention to the fact that when technical terms and scientific nouns appear for the first time, the author should know to explain them in detail with simple words. When scientific principles are not easy to explain, he should give examples that children are familiar with.

    Finally, we should all learn from Ilin and read more of Ilin's books. Ilin said: "Promoting natural science, like promoting anything, is an art of conquering the reader, that is to say, this battle must be carried out in accordance with the rules of various strategies and tactics. All words, thoughts, facts, and conclusions must be carefully selected and matched, and no word should be idle. Thoughts must take the lead with the support of powerful facts, and every conclusion must become a high ground occupied after a fierce attack." (Ilin: "Talking About Science")

    I hope that scientists and writers will write more for children. Scientific workers should regard the writing of children's science books as a part of the popularization of science; scientific workers should pay as much attention as possible to the artistry of children's science books. Young people who are interested in writing children's science books, especially teachers in primary and secondary schools, should strive to learn research methods from scientists and writing skills from writers; learn scientificity from science and artistry from literature. Children's science books must be works that combine science and literature, and then they can be absorbed by children.

    谈谈儿童科学读物的创作问题
    高士其
    当我写这篇文章的时候，我回忆起二十年前的往事。那时候我和陶行知先生一起，在上海创办儿童科学通讯学校，开始我的写作生活。我记得当时陶先生曾对我说：“写通俗文章就是写话，每一字每一句都必须口语化。”这个指示虽然不是全面的深刻的，但在当时确实给了我很大的启发。后来我读伊林最初写的几本书，如“十万个为什么”、“几点钟”、“黑白”、“不夜天”、“五年计划故事”等，我觉得伊林的作品，内容丰富、文字生动、思想活泼、段落简短，我决心向伊林学习。
    从那时候起，直到抗日战争爆发，我曾写过不少的科学小品文，在“读书生活”、“妇女生活”等杂志上发表。后来有一部分集成单行本，如“细菌与人”、“抗战与防疫”、“菌儿自传”等都是。
    解放后，回到北京，久为病魔所困的我，写字、说话都已经困难了，我只能用短小的诗句来写科学童话，这些科学童话都发表在“中国少年儿童”杂志上。“我们的土壤妈妈”就是在这个时候写成的。这几年来，我虽然也为少年儿童们写过一些科学诗和散文，但我很惭愧，我的努力是很不够的。最近，有好些青年读者写信给我说：他们愿意献身于儿童科学读物的写作。这是多么令人兴奋的事啊！为了纪念“六一”国际儿童节，我愿就以往的写作经验来谈谈儿童科学读物的创作问题，以供读者参考。
    首先，我们应该认识写作儿童科学读物的目的，也就是为什么写的问题。
    谁都知道，我们国家目前正在为实现社会主义工业化而奋斗。无论那一个部门的工作，都是围绕着这个伟大的目标而进行的。儿童科学读物的创作，也是如此。我们又知道，在社会主义社会里，所有的人都需要有科学知识。科学已经参加了我们的生活，成为我们日常生活中不可缺少的一部分。人们要在生活和生产斗争中取得胜利，就必须从少年儿童时代起，逐步掌握科学知识。今天的少年儿童，不就是明天的社会主义的建设者和保卫者吗？不就是新的劳动后备军吗？
    儿童科学读物的任务，是要教育儿童以生活斗争和生产斗争的知识来武装自己，教会他们去认识自然和改造自然。例如，现在夏天到了，我们就应当教会儿童注意夏季的饮食卫生和环境卫生，使他们懂得一些预防肠胃传染病的知识，这对于公共卫生、对于人民的健康是非常重要的。又如，我们要对儿童讲钢铁的故事，因为钢铁是工业基础的基础，宣传钢铁工业，就是要教育儿童认识到工人阶级力量的伟大，使他们热爱劳动，热爱社会主义的建设事业。
    第二，是关于儿童科学读物的内容问题，也就是写什么的问题。
    科学知识的领域是非常广阔的：从原子到宇宙，从微生物到人类，从沙漠到海洋，从地球外部的大气层到地球内部的矿藏，从生命的起源到劳动创造人类，从石器到现代的机器，从农业到医药卫生等等都可以谈。正如伊林所说：“每一门科学仿佛都在向我们召唤，邀请我们专门写它。到处都闪耀着文学还没有接触过的一堆堆最宝贵的新材料。到处标明着文学家们的笔尖还没有走过的道路。”（伊林：“论儿童的科学读物”，中国青年出版社出版）
    在这样的情形之下，我们应当考虑的是什么呢？
    一、要写我们所熟悉的那门科学。如果我们自己对于主题还缺乏深刻的了解，那末，就不可能把道理讲解清楚，读者就更不可能搞明白了。伊林说得对：“恶劣的叙述，往往是模糊的理解直接的结果。”（伊林：“谈谈科学”一文）最近，我为“少年文艺”五月号写了一篇“炼铁的故事”，开头我就很担心写不好，因为我对于炼铁的过程是不十分熟悉的，虽然我也看过几本关于钢铁工业的书；后来，还是我亲自到石景山钢铁厂去体验了一次，才敢动笔。
    二、要写儿童迫切需要的知识，这就要求我们把科学知识和儿童的日常生活结合起来，写他们周围的事物。例如，在伊林的作品里，他写练习本、铅笔、茶杯、小刀、衬衣、钟表、电灯、汽车和飞机等，这些都是儿童周围的事物。如果我们给儿童写的是“宇宙线”的原理，或是爱因斯坦的“相对论”，这就离他们太远并超过他们接受的能力了。
    三、写作的计划不要过于庞大，如果范围过广，就会造成许多困难，使生动具体的细节不容易表现出来。
    四、我们要向儿童宣传唯物主义的世界观。要使儿童感觉到大自然是一个整体。各种事物彼此之间都有联系，这门科学和那门科学都不是孤立的。
    五、我们要引导儿童走到科学实验室里去，使他们了解科学家的生活和工作，鼓舞他们学习科学知识的热情。
    六、应该着重指出，我们还必须教育儿童重视劳动。我们的儿童科学读物决不能像资本主义国家的儿童科学读物一样，单纯地追求趣味或猎奇，我们的儿童科学读物是面向着千百万未来的劳动者的。所以我们必须指导他们怎样和大自然斗争，并且战胜大自然。
    这样作，我相信我们的儿童科学读物将会把科学中最重要和最有趣的材料，一天比一天更多地引入文学领域，使科学一天比一天更普及于人民。
    第三，关于儿童科学读物的写作方法问题，也就是怎样写的问题。
    儿童科学读物的作者，应当是爱好科学，同时又是爱好文艺的人。他必须是受过科学训练的，能搜集丰富的科学材料，并且知道怎样去分析、研究和整理这些材料。他必须是语言的艺术家，他不仅懂得儿童的语言，懂得儿童的心理特点和思想感情，而且能把许多复杂奥妙的事物，简单明了地用儿童常用的语言表达出来，引人入胜。儿童科学读物应该生动活泼、浅易近人，不但能启发儿童的理智，而且能激动儿童的情感。因此，它的创作形式应该是多样的，而绝大部分是文艺性的，决不应当是千篇一律的广告式的文字和枯涩无味的旧教科书。
    儿童科学读物的作者，必须忠于科学历史，他必须和一切歪曲科学历史的现象进行斗争，如把电灯的发明，归功于爱迪生一个人，把无线电的发明说成是马可尼，而忘记了波波夫。
    此外，我们还必须注意到，当专门术语和科学名词第一次出现的时候，作者应该知道用浅显的文字，加以详细的解释。当科学道理不容易讲明白的时候，他应该举出儿童所熟悉的例子。
    最后，我们都应该向伊林学习，多读伊林的书。伊林说：“宣传自然科学和宣传任何东西一样，是征服读者的一种艺术，也就是说这场战斗必须依照各种战略、战术的规则来进行。所有用字、思想、事实和结论，一定要经过选择和配搭得当，不要有一个字呆着不动，要凭借有力的事实的支援来使思想领先，要使每一个结论都成为经过猛攻后才占领的高地。”（伊林：“谈谈科学”一文）
    我希望科学家和作家们多为儿童写作。科学工作者应当把儿童科学读物的写作，看作是科学普及工作的一部分；科学工作者应当尽一切可能地注意儿童科学读物的文艺性。有志于儿童科学读物写作的青年，尤其是中小学的教师，应当努力向科学家学习他们的研究方法，向文学家学习他们的写作技巧；向科学吸取科学性，向文学吸取文艺性。儿童科学读物必须是科学和文学相结合的作品，然后才能为儿童们所吸收。
