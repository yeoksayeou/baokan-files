    Beijing Holds Industrial Labor Model Representative Conference
    [From Our Newspaper] The Beijing Industrial Labor Model Representative Conference is scheduled to open on the 4th.

    There will be 301 labor models attending the conference representing heavy industry, railways, coal mines, machinery, construction, light industry, municipal and other industrial trade unions, as well as factories under various districts. Representatives will include advanced figures from state-owned, locally state-owned, jointly state-private, and private factories and mines, including workers, technicians, and staff.

    Last year, state-owned, locally state-owned, and jointly state-private factories and mines in the city overfulfilled the state plan, increasing production and practicing thrift by over 780 billion yuan. This is inseparable from the hard work and unity of the labor models in their various positions. Among the labor models attending this conference, many made great achievements in technological innovation last year.

    The labor models will exchange experiences in technological innovation at this conference. Through this conference, their advanced experiences and advanced ideas will be further promoted in factories and mines throughout the city. This will play an important role in raising the socialist consciousness of the city's workers, carrying out the technological innovation movement, and further advancing the labor emulation drive.

    北京召开工业劳动模范代表大会
    【本报讯】北京市工业劳动模范代表大会定于四日开幕。
    出席大会的劳动模范将有重工业、铁路、煤矿、机械、建筑、轻工业、市政等产业工会及各区所属工厂的劳动模范三百零一人以及八十五个模范小组、一个模范食堂、一个模范车间、一个模范单位的代表。代表们包括国营、地方国营、公私合营、私营厂矿企业工人、技术人员、职员中的先进人物。
    去年，全市国营、地方国营、公私合营厂矿企业超额完成了国家计划，增产节约七千八百多亿元。这是和劳动模范们在各种岗位上刻苦钻研并团结群众共同努力分不开的。在出席这次大会的劳动模范中，许多人去年在技术革新方面都做出了很大的成绩。
    劳动模范们将在这次大会上交流技术革新的经验。通过这次大会，他们的先进经验和先进思想将在全市各厂矿企业进一步推广。这对提高全市职工的社会主义觉悟，开展技术革新运动，把劳动竞赛向前推进一步，将会发生重要的作用。
