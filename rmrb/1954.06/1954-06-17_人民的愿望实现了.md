    The People's Wishes Have Been Realized
    Guo Yu'en, Recipient of the "Patriotic Production Gold Star Medal"
    The draft constitution of the People's Republic of China, which the broad masses of the people have been longing for, has been published. We feel very happy in our hearts. In the dark old society, our broad masses of working people could not get any guarantee of life, nor could they get freedom; the fruits of our hard work could not be enjoyed by ourselves, but were plundered by the ruling class. The peasants lived a life like cattle and horses. Landlords robbed grain and demanded money, beat and cursed people. Tens of millions of hard-working people were tormented to death by such a painful life. Take my village, Chuandi Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, for example. In the past, 70 to 80 percent of the land in the whole village was controlled by a small number of landlords and rich peasants, and more than 40 out of 80 households worked as hired laborers. I became a hired laborer with my father at the age of eighteen. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we really have guarantees, we have been distributed land, and we have gained freedom and happiness. In 1943, we actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to organize and develop production. In 1951, we established an agricultural production cooperative. With the improvement of productivity, our lives have improved day by day. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the average yield of land in the whole village was 210 catties of grain per mu. In 1953, the average yield per mu increased by 10 catties compared with 1952. The average yield of our agricultural production cooperative was 480 catties and eight liang per mu last autumn, so in February this year I was awarded the 1952 Patriotic Production Gold Star Medal. Compared with the old society, it is really like heaven and earth. We must use practical actions to support the draft constitution: under the leadership of the Party committee, actively carry out propaganda and education to the broad masses of the people through reading groups, blackboard newspapers, etc., so that everyone recognizes that the constitution is the fundamental law of the country, and educate everyone to become a model of abiding by the constitution. In addition, we must actively lead the peasants to take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation.

    人民的愿望实现了
    “爱国丰产金星奖章”获得者　郭玉恩
    全国广大人民所渴望的中华人民共和国宪法草案公布了。我们心里感到非常高兴。在黑暗的旧社会里，我们广大的劳动人民根本得不到生活的保障，得不到自由；我们辛苦劳动所得来的果实自己不能享受，而被统治阶级剥夺去了。农民过着牛马般的生活。地主们抢粮要钱，打人骂人。成千万的勤劳人民都被这样的痛苦生活折磨死了。就拿我所住的山西省平顺县川底村来说，过去全村百分之七十到八十的土地掌握在少数地主富农的手里，八十多户人家就有四十多人当了长工。我在十八岁上就和父亲当了长工。在共产党毛主席的领导下，我们可真的有了保障，分到了地，得到了自由幸福。我们在一九四三年积极响应了毛主席的号召，组织起来，发展生产。一九五一年成立了农业生产合作社，随着生产力的提高，我们的生活也一天比一天提高了。抗日战争前，全村土地每亩平均产二百一十斤粮，一九五三年每亩平均产量比一九五二年增加十斤。我们的农业生产合作社前年秋田每亩平均产到四百八十斤零八两，因此在今年二月我荣获了一九五二年爱国丰产金星奖章。比起旧社会来，真是天上地下。我们要以实际行为，来拥护宪法草案：在党委领导下，通过读报组、黑板报等积极向广大人民进行宣传教育，使每个人认识宪法是国家的根本法，并教育每个人成为遵守宪法的模范。此外，还要积极领导农民走互助合作的道路。
