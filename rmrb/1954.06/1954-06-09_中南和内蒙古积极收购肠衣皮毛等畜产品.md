Central-South and Inner Mongolia Actively Purchase Livestock Products Such as Sausage Casings and Furs

    Livestock product companies in various parts of the Central-South region are vigorously purchasing livestock products such as pig and sheep casings, wool, feathers, and various hides. Livestock product companies in various regions have widely established business relationships with supply and marketing cooperatives, ethnic trade companies, and others, entrusting them to purchase on their behalf. The Livestock Product Company of Henan Province has already signed business contracts with more than 80 percent of the county and district cooperatives in the province. The Central-South region livestock product companies also helped cooperatives train a group of livestock product purchasing cadres last winter. From January to mid-May this year, the entire region has purchased various livestock products worth more than 150 billion yuan.

    In order to expand the source of goods, the livestock product companies in the Central-South region have newly managed 14 new commodities such as pig skin, beef casings, egret feathers, and Angora rabbit hair. The purchase of these new commodities has been welcomed by the broad masses. ×××

    Currently, it is the season for spring wool, cashmere, lambskins and other livestock products to be on the market in Inner Mongolia. Livestock product companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Inner Mongolia are actively engaged in purchasing. In order to correctly implement the state's price policy, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Company of the China National Native Produce and Animal By-products Import & Export Corporation transferred technical personnel from local livestock product companies in early May to study purchasing operations in a concentrated manner. The livestock product companies in Hohhot and Baotou have sent cadres to help supply and marketing cooperatives with purchasing work.

    The herdsmen in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are now enthusiastically selling furs and other livestock products to the state. For example, the sales department of the Hohhot Branch of the China National Native Produce and Animal By-products Import & Export Corporation used to purchase a maximum of just over 20,000 jin of wool a day last year, but now it can purchase an average of more than 50,000 jin per day.

    中南和内蒙古积极收购肠衣皮毛等畜产品
    中南区各地畜产公司大力收购猪、羊肠衣，羊毛，羽毛和各种皮张等畜产品。各地畜产公司广泛地和供销合作社、民族贸易公司等建立了业务关系，委托他们代为收购。河南省的畜产公司即已和全省百分之八十以上的县、区合作社签订了业务合同。中南区畜产公司还在去年冬季帮助合作社训练了一批收购畜产的干部。从今年一月到五月中旬，全区已收购了价值一千五百亿元以上的各种畜产品。
    为了扩大货源，中南区的畜产公司新经营了猪皮、牛肠衣、鹭鸶毛、安哥拉兔毛等十四种新商品。这些新商品的收购工作，受到了广大群众的欢迎。×××
    目前，正是内蒙古地区春毛、羊绒、羔皮等畜产品上市的季节，内蒙古各地畜产公司和供销合作社等单位正积极进行收购。为了正确地贯彻国家的价格政策，中国畜产公司内蒙古自治区公司在五月上旬抽调各地畜产公司的技术人员，集中学习了收购业务。呼和浩特市和包头市的畜产公司都派出干部，帮助供销合作社等进行收购工作。
    内蒙古自治区的牧民们现在正在踊跃地把皮毛等畜产品卖给国家。如中国畜产公司呼和浩特市支公司的门市部，去年一天最多只收购到两万多斤羊毛，现在每天平均能收购五万多斤。（王　温）
