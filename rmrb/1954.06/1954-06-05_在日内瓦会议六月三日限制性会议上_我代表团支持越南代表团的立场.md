Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 3rd: The following communique was issued from the restricted meeting of the Geneva Conference discussing the restoration of peace in Indochina on June 3rd:

    "The nine-nation delegations continued to discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina at the restricted meeting on June 3rd. The next restricted meeting will be held on June 4th."

Xinhua News Agency, June 4th: TASS, Geneva, June 4th: According to available information, the nine-nation delegations continued to discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina at the meeting on June 3rd. The delegation of the People's Republic of China supported the position taken by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the issue of establishing an agency to supervise the implementation of the terms of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina and determining the functions and powers of these agencies.

    The delegation of the People's Republic of China believes that mixed agencies and international agencies composed of representatives of neutral countries should work in parallel and not be subordinate to each other. Supervision of the implementation of the ceasefire agreement should be carried out by the mixed commission, because the mixed commission is composed of representatives of both parties to the agreement, and therefore the implementation of this agreement rests entirely with them. The representative of the People's Republic of China pointed out that the notion that the two sides cannot reach an agreement and that the mixed commission cannot arbitrate on the disputes raised by the two sides is untenable. He referred to the agreement between the two sides on the withdrawal of seriously wounded prisoners of war from Dien Bien Phu. Although one party violated this agreement, the agreement was finally implemented, and the seriously wounded prisoners of war were finally withdrawn. As for the neutral nations commission, the Chinese delegation believes that it should bear the primary responsibility for preventing the entry of troops and war supplies into Indochina from outside Indochina after the cessation of hostilities. That is to say, prohibiting the entry of new troops and supplies via all land borders, all seaports and sea borders, and via air into Indochina. The Neutral Nations Commission should exercise the same functions and powers in Laos and Cambodia as in Vietnam. Otherwise, foreign countries—primarily the United States—may establish military bases in Laos and Cambodia and threaten Vietnam from there. The People's Republic of China can never agree to this.

    The French delegation raised the question of to whom the planned actions of the Neutral Nations Commission should be responsible.

    The delegation of the People's Republic of China pointed out: The answer to this question is obvious. Because, according to the French delegation's own proposal, and with the agreement of the participants, the implementation of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina should be guaranteed by the countries participating in the Geneva Conference. Therefore, the Neutral Nations Commission should be responsible to the nine countries participating in the Geneva Conference and guaranteeing the implementation of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina.

    The representative of the delegation of the People's Republic of China pointed out that the proposal made by Bao Dai's representative to the conference on June 3rd is unacceptable. This proposal advocated that the United Nations should exercise the functions of a neutral body to supervise the implementation of the terms of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 3rd: Special correspondent of this agency reports: According to news received here, at the restricted meeting of the Geneva Conference on June 2nd discussing the Indochina issue, discussions continued on the supervision of the implementation of the Indochina armistice and neutral nation supervision. At the meeting, the delegations focused on the issue of the composition of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, but the representatives of Western countries, in addition to unreasonably opposing the proposals of the Soviet delegation, did not put forward any concrete proposals.

    At the last restricted meeting, the Soviet delegation put forward a constructive proposal to form a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission composed of Poland, Czechoslovakia, India, and Pakistan. At the meeting on the 2nd, the US representative repeated his absurd claim that Poland and Czechoslovakia are not neutral countries, but he could not provide any decent basis. The French representative Bidault agreed with Smith's opinion, and it attempted to confuse the current practical issue with the theoretical question of whether neutrality is possible between the socialist democratic camp and the imperialist camp.

    Smith and Bidault's speeches were refuted by Zhou Enlai, the chief representative of the Chinese delegation, and Molotov, the chief representative of the Soviet delegation. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai cited the "Interim Report" and "Final Report" issued by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in Korea in December 1953 and February 1954 to refute Smith's claim. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out that these two documents were approved by the three-nation committee of India, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, while Switzerland and Sweden were in the minority and did not agree. This proves which side is just. If everyone admits that India is neutral, then the facts in Korea prove that Poland and Czechoslovakia are just as neutral as India; if it is said that communist countries are not neutral countries, then there are no neutral countries in the world. Because every country either belongs to this political ideology or that political ideology, therefore, any country that has not participated in the Indochina war and is willing to work for world peace is a neutral country. Article 37 of the Korean Armistice Agreement stipulates that the definition of neutral countries is countries that have not participated in the Korean War, and the definition of this agreement also applies to the armistice negotiations on the Indochina issue. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai believes that the Soviet delegation's suggestion that Poland, Czechoslovakia, India, and Pakistan participate in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is appropriate. Because Poland and Czechoslovakia have diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, one of the belligerents in Indochina, while India and Pakistan have diplomatic relations with France, the other belligerent.

    The chief representative of the Soviet delegation, Molotov, also pointed out that Smith's attitude of denying that all non-capitalist countries can play a neutral role is close to the idea of an anti-communist alliance, which is unreasonable. If Smith takes this attitude, it is tantamount to saying that he does not want to solve the problem and does not want to reach an agreement. This attitude is to hinder the solution of the problem.

    Foreign Minister Molotov also pointed out that the four neutral countries supervising the Korean armistice are all European countries. The Soviet delegation's suggestion this time is that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be composed of two Asian countries and two European countries, which is even more correct. This takes into account the existence of two hostile parties and should bring them closer. Poland and Czechoslovakia have diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and India and Pakistan have diplomatic relations with France. Therefore, such a composition is appropriate.

    In his speech, the French representative Bidault expressed his views on the relationship between the institutions supervising the ceasefire and the tasks of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. He said that the main tasks of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be:
  (1) Supervise the gathering of regular troops; (2) Supervise the boundaries of the designated assembly areas and the boundaries of possible demilitarized zones; (3) Supervise the implementation of the provisions on the release of prisoners of war and detained civilians. However, Bidault did not include such an important issue as ensuring that new troops and military supplies are not transported into Indochina from outside Indochina within the main tasks of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, although he also admitted that this was necessary. According to Bidault's opinion, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission can use the mixed commission composed of both parties, but the mixed commission should be under the authority and guidance of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Bidault once again attempted to deny the principle of a simultaneous ceasefire throughout Indochina that the conference had reached. He said that a ceasefire may not occur simultaneously in the three countries of Indochina, and the tasks of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission supervising the ceasefire in Cambodia and Laos are also different from those in Vietnam.

    Pham Van Dong, the chief representative of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, put forward specific opinions on the institutions and tasks of the ceasefire supervision in Vietnam in his speech. He said that the main tasks of supervision should be to supervise the implementation of the adjustment area and the troop transfer plan of both sides and to supervise that no new troops and military supplies are transported into Indochina from outside. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam delegation suggested that the role and responsibility of the mixed supervision commission to be formed is to implement the ceasefire agreement. This commission is actually a ceasefire commission. In order to correctly implement the adjustment area and the transfer of troops by both sides, this type of institution is indispensable. If both sides want peace, then both sides have the responsibility to correctly implement the terms of the agreement. Moreover, due to the complexity of the Indochina battlefield, only those who understand the local situation can see clearly and smoothly implement the agreement. If one party violates the agreement, then the mixed supervision commission can give useful advice to that party to make it correctly implement the agreement. Therefore, the basic task of the mixed supervision commission is to correctly implement the ceasefire agreement. This responsibility should be borne by the main parties involved in the event, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and France.

    Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong further pointed out that since the main task of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is to supervise the prohibition of the entry of troops and military equipment from outside Indochina, it should also be taken into account that if one of the parties violates the agreement, then the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission can propose to the mixed supervision commission, and this mixed supervision commission should be responsible for proposing to the relevant party to make it correctly implement the agreement. The supervision of neutral nations should naturally be carried out in the three countries of Indochina. Because, war and peace, like in Indochina as a whole are inseparable.

    Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong said that the relationship between the mixed supervision commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be one of mutual cooperation, rather than a relationship of dependence or subordination. If the intervention of the mixed supervision commission against a party that violates the agreement is unsuccessful or ineffective, then it can notify the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. At the same time, the belligerent parties can and should also report to the relevant countries that guarantee the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. After these countries have consulted together, they can take necessary collective measures.

    Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong agreed with the Soviet delegation's proposal regarding the members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

### 在日内瓦会议六月三日限制性会议上  我代表团支持越南代表团的立场

    在日内瓦会议六月三日限制性会议上
    我代表团支持越南代表团的立场
   【新华社日内瓦三日电】日内瓦会议讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的限制性会议三日发表公报如下：
    “九国代表团在六月三日的限制性会议中继续讨论恢复印度支那和平问题。下次限制性会议将在六月四日举行。”
   【新华社四日讯】塔斯社日内瓦四日讯：据现有的消息说，九国代表团在六月三日的会议上继续讨论恢复印度支那和平的问题。中华人民共和国代表团支持越南民主共和国代表团在成立监督印度支那停止敌对行动协定条款的履行的机构以及确定这些机构的职权的问题上所采取的立场。
    中华人民共和国代表团认为，混合机构以及由中立国代表组成的国际机构应该平行地进行工作，彼此互不隶属。对于停火协定履行的监督应由混合委员会来执行，因为混合委员会是由缔结协定的双方代表组成的，因此这个协定的履行完全在于他们。中华人民共和国的代表指出那种认为双方不可能达成协议以及混合委员会对于向它们提出的双方争执的问题不能实行仲裁的说法是不能成立的。他讲到双方关于撤运奠边府重伤战俘问题的协议。虽然有一方违反了这个协议，但是这个协议终于履行了，重伤战俘终于撤走了。至于中立国委员会，中国代表团认为它应该负担防止在敌对行动停止以后由印度支那境外将军队和战争供应品运入印度支那的主要责任。这就是说，禁止经由印度支那所有的陆地边界、所有的海港和海上边界以及经由空中运入新的部队和供应品。中立国委员会应该在寮国和高棉行使像在越南所行使的同样的职权。否则，外国——首先是美国，就可能在寮国和高棉建立军事基地并从那里威胁越南。对于这一点，中华人民共和国是绝不能同意的。
    法国代表团提出了筹划中的中立国委员会的行动究竟应该向谁负责的问题。
    中华人民共和国代表团指出：对于这个问题的回答是很明显的。因为，根据法国代表团自己的建议，又经过与会者的同意，关于印度支那停止敌对行动协定的履行，应该由参加日内瓦会议的各国来保证。因此，中立国委员会应该向参加日内瓦会议并保证印度支那停止敌对行动协定的履行的九个国家负责。
    中华人民共和国代表团的代表指出保大代表在六月三日向会议提出的建议是不能接受的，这个建议主张应由联合国行使一个中立机构的职权，来监督印度支那停止敌对行动协定条款的履行。
   【新华社日内瓦三日电】本社特派记者报道：根据此间得到的消息，在六月二日举行的日内瓦会议讨论印度支那问题的限制性会议上，继续讨论了对印度支那停战实施监督和中立国监督问题。会上，各国代表团着重讨论了中立国监督委员会的成员问题，但是西方国家的代表除了一味无理地反对苏联代表团的建议外，并没有提出任何具体建议。
    在上次限制性会议上苏联代表团提出了由波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、印度和巴基斯坦组成中立国监督委员会的建设性建议。美国代表在二日的会议上重复他所说过的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克不是中立国的荒谬说法，但是他又提不出任何像样的根据来。法国代表皮杜尔同意史密斯的意见，它企图用在社会主义民主阵营和帝国主义阵营之间能不能中立的理论性问题来混淆当前讨论的实际问题。
    史密斯和皮杜尔的发言受到了中国代表团首席代表周恩来和苏联代表团首席代表莫洛托夫的批驳。周恩来外长举出朝鲜的中立国遣返委员会在一九五三年十二月和一九五四年二月发表的“临时报告”和“最后报告”来驳斥史密斯的说法。周恩来外长指出，这两个文件都是由印度、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克三国委员通过的，瑞士、瑞典处于少数地位未予同意。这就证明了哪一方面才是公正的。如果大家承认印度是中立的，那么朝鲜的事实证明波兰和捷克斯洛伐克正是像印度一样的中立；如果说共产主义国家不是中立国，那么世界上便没有中立国了。因为每个国家不是属于这种政治思想，就是属于那种政治思想，因此凡是没有参加印度支那战争而又愿意为世界和平工作的国家就是中立国。朝鲜停战协定第三十七款规定中立国的定义就是没有参加朝鲜战争的国家，这一协定的定义也适用于印度支那问题的停战谈判上。周恩来外长认为：苏联代表团建议由波、捷、印、巴四国参加中立国监督委员会是适当的。因为波兰、捷克斯洛伐克与印度支那交战一方的越南民主共和国有外交关系，而印度、巴基斯坦则与交战的另一方法国有外交关系。
    苏联代表团首席代表莫洛托夫也指出：史密斯那种否定一切非资本主义国家可以起中立国作用的态度是接近于反共同盟的思想的，是没有道理的。如果史密斯采取这种态度，那就等于说他不想解决问题，不想达成协议。这种态度就是要阻挠解决问题。
    莫洛托夫外长还指出：监察朝鲜停战的四个中立国都是欧洲国家，苏联代表团这次建议由两个亚洲国家和两个欧洲国家来组成中立国监督委员会，这样就更正确。这是考虑到两个敌对方面的存在，应该使他们接近起来。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和越南民主共和国有外交关系，印度、巴基斯坦和法国有外交关系。因此这样的组成是适当的。
    法国代表皮杜尔在他的发言中对监督停火的机构之间的关系和中立国监督委员会的任务发表了意见。他说，中立国监督委员会的主要任务应该是：
  （一）监督正规军的集结；（二）监督划出的集结地区的界线以及监督可能划出的非军事地段的界线；（三）监督执行释放战俘和被拘平民的规定。然而，皮杜尔却没有把保证停止从印度支那境外运入新的军队和军火这样的重要问题包括在中立国监督委员会的主要任务之内，虽然他也承认这是必要的。按照皮杜尔的意见，中立国监督委员会可以利用双方组成的混合委员会，但是混合委员会要在中立国监督委员会的权力和指导之下。皮杜尔又一次企图否认会议已达成的在印度支那全境同时停火的原则。他说，可以不在印度支那三国同时停火，监督高棉、寮国停火的中立国监督委员会的任务也和越南的不同。
    越南民主共和国代表团首席代表范文同在发言中对于越南停战监督的机构和任务提出了具体意见。他说，监督的主要任务应该是监督调整地区及双方军队转移方案的执行和监督一切新的军队及军火不从境外运入印度支那。越南民主共和国代表团建议组成的混合监督委员会的作用及责任就是执行停战协定。这个委员会实际上就是一个停战委员会。为了正确执行调整地区及双方部队的转移，这种机构是必不可少的。如果双方都要和平，那么双方就有责任正确执行协定的条款。而且，由于印度支那战场的复杂性，只有了解当地情况的人才能看清楚并顺利执行协定。如果一方违反协议，那么混合监督委员会就可以向该方给予有益的意见，使其正确执行协议。因此，混合监督委员会的基本任务就是要正确地执行停战协定。这个责任应由事件有关的主要双方越南民主共和国和法国负担起来。
    范文同代理外长又指出：由于中立国监督委员会的主要任务就是监督不准由印度支那境外运进军队及军备，同时还应考虑到如果双方中之一方违反协议，那么中立国监督委员会就可以向混合监督委员会提出，这个混合监督委员会就应负责向有关一方提出使其正确执行协议。中立国的监督自然应该在印度支那三国执行。因为，战争与和平一样在印度支那全境是不可分的。
    范文同代理外长说，混合监督委员会和中立国监督委员会之间的关系应该是相互合作的关系，而非依赖或隶属的关系。如果混合监督委员会对违反协议的一方的干涉不成或无效，那么就可以通知中立国监督委员会。同时，交战双方还可以而且应该报告保证停战协定的履行的有关国家。这些国家在共同协商之后，即可采取必要的集体措施。
    范文同代理外长赞成苏联代表团提出的关于中立国监督委员会的成员的建议。
