	Southwest Regions Strengthen Education and Leadership for Handicraft Workers
	Southwest regions are actively strengthening education and leadership for handicraft workers, and the socialist transformation of handicrafts in the entire region has made new progress.
	Since the Southwest District held its first handicraft work conference in January, various places in Yunnan have widely convened handicraft worker representative meetings, attended by more than 10,000 representatives. In Guizhou Province, 70% of counties and cities, and in Xikang Province, nine counties have convened handicraft worker representative meetings. In Sichuan Province, most counties, cities, and districts have convened meetings for handicraft workers, and some areas have held two or three such meetings. These meetings systematically and deeply educated handicraft workers on the general task of the country's transition period. At the meetings, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places further signed a large number of processing and ordering contracts with handicraft workers. In Wanxian Special District of Sichuan Province alone, supply and marketing cooperatives signed more than 15,350 contracts with handicraft workers, with a total product value of 5.48 billion yuan. Supply and marketing cooperatives in more than 80 counties in Yunnan Province established business relationships with more than 23,000 handicraft workers.
	In order to implement the socialist transformation of handicrafts in a planned and step-by-step manner, Chongqing City and Sichuan, Yunnan, Xikang, Guizhou, and other provinces are conducting surveys of handicrafts, studying the industry categories, production and sales patterns, class relations, and other conditions of handicrafts in various places. This survey work will be largely completed in the third quarter of this year.
	For the existing handicraft production cooperatives, various places are actively consolidating and rectifying them. After rectification, the ideological awareness of members of many handicraft production cooperatives has been significantly improved, and production has greatly improved. For example, the average monthly output of the Chengdu Cloth Shoe Production Cooperative has increased by 16.4% compared to last year, and the average cost per pair of shoes has been reduced by 1,000 yuan. The output of the Chongqing Leather Production Cooperative in March this year increased by 31% compared to December 1953. The Guiyang Leather Production Cooperative, after rectification, had a surplus of over 100 million yuan from January to April this year, equivalent to 80% of the surplus of the past two years.
	During this period, various places also appropriately developed handicraft cooperative organizations. By the end of April, according to incomplete statistics, there were 369 handicraft production cooperatives in the entire region, with more than 12,300 members, and 3,793 handicraft production groups, with more than 89,500 members. The total production value of handicraft cooperative organizations in the first quarter of this year was more than 87 billion yuan. Compared to last year, handicraft production cooperatives increased by 29.92%.

    西南各地加强对手工业者的教育和领导
    西南各地积极加强对手工业者的教育和领导，全区对手工业实行社会主义改造的工作有新的进展。
    从一月间西南区召开第一次手工业工作会议以后，云南各地广泛召开了手工业者代表会，出席会议的代表有一万多人；贵州省百分之七十的县、市，西康省有九个县都召开了手工业者代表会；四川省大部县、市、区都曾召集手工业者开会，有的地区还召开过两、三次。这些会议，都比较系统、深入地对手工业者进行了国家过渡时期总任务的教育。在会议上，各地供销合作社进一步和手工业者签订了大批加工订货合同。仅四川省万县专区的供销合作社就和手工业者签订了一万五千三百五十多件合同，产品总值达五十四亿八千多万元；云南省八十多个县的供销合作社和二万三千多个手工业者建立了业务关系。
    为了有计划、有步骤地对手工业者实行社会主义改造，重庆市和四川、云南、西康、贵州等省都正进行对手工业的调查工作，研究各地手工业的行业类别、产销规律、阶级关系等情况。这一调查工作，将于今年第三季度大体完成。
    对于原有的手工业生产合作社，各地正积极进行巩固和整顿。许多手工业生产合作社经过整顿以后，社员思想觉悟有显著提高，生产有很大改进。如成都市布鞋生产合作社现在平均月产量比去年提高了百分之十六点四，每双鞋的成本平均降低一千元；重庆市皮革生产合作社今年三月份的产量比一九五三年十二月份提高了百分之三十一；贵阳市皮革生产合作社经过整顿，今年一月份到四月份盈余一亿余元，相当于过去两年盈余的百分之八十。
    在这个期间，各地还适当发展了手工业合作组织。到四月底止，据不完全的统计，全区已有手工业生产合作社三百六十九个，社员一万二千三百多人，有手工业生产小组三千七百九十三个，组员八万九千五百多人。手工业合作组织今年第一季度的生产总值，有八百七十多亿元。和去年比较，手工业生产合作社增加了百分之二十九点九二。
