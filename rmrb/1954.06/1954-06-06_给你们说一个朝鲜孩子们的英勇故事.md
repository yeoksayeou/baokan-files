To Our Beloved Young Friends Back Home:

You must be busy preparing to welcome your own festival - "June 1st" International Children's Day! We, far away in Korea, also often think of you, wishing you a better celebration of your festival. In recent days, we have taken out your letters more than once, re-reading those enthusiastic words, looking at the innocent and lovely faces in the photos, and even wearing the red scarves you sent us.... To fulfill the requests you made in several letters, we made a special trip to the Chonnae County Third Middle School on the east coast of Korea to visit some of the children of the "Unrim Young Guard." Although their heroic struggle against the enemy took place a long time ago, writing about it for you today feels like it has a new meaning. It was October 14, 1950, when the iron hooves of the American-Syngman Rhee bandit army trampled into Sincang-ri, Chonnae County. As soon as they entered the village, they burned down the intact houses and looted the grain. The peaceful and happy village was instantly transformed into a terrifying war ruin. On this day, three young students from the Third Middle School stood by the river near the school, watching this scene, their eyes filled with tears, their teeth biting their lips. They remembered the happiness that five years of peaceful life had brought them, the trauma that the Japanese devils had inflicted on their young hearts five years ago, and now they had no school, no home, the desks and blackboards in the classroom were crackling as they burned, and their parents were being taken in batches to the warehouses in the village.... Finally, they stopped their tears, clenched their small fists, and left their beloved village with hearts full of the flames of revenge. That night, they ran to Mt. Hak'am, more than twenty miles away from home, and lived in a small cave – this became the base of their Guard, and a guerrilla force composed entirely of children grew up.

The names of these three children were Oh Joon-min, Cho Jung-hee, and Kim Young-duk. Oh Joon-min was the oldest, only fourteen years old, but the education that the Young Pioneers had given them over the years made them know what they should do when the motherland was in such a difficult moment. They quickly organized themselves, elected Oh Joon-min as their leader, and set out the battle cry: "To defend the school, the hometown, and the motherland, we will resolutely fight to the end and never retreat!" There were many difficulties. They had no food, no weapons, and no combat experience, but they gradually overcame all the difficulties. They found a hundred detonators in the mine in Sinsan-ri, obtained a rifle, a few bullets, and a grenade from the puppet security team members, and collected some leftover food from their homes. They began their struggle.

First, they distributed leaflets to mobilize their classmates to join their organization. After the leaflets were sent out, the first one to join the team was Kim Byung-koo, who also found a mimeograph machine from the ruins of the school and brought it to the team. From then on, more leaflets flew from this cave to every corner of Sincang-ri, encouraging more students and people in the village to join the struggle. Soon, their force expanded to twenty-three people, and they were officially named the "Unrim Young Guard" after the Unrim Township where they were located. Soon, the Guard established contact with the guerrilla team led by Yoon Eung-ryong, chairman of the Workers' Party in nearby Munchon County. The children received direct leadership from the Party, which further strengthened their confidence in the struggle.

One night, team member Moon Bong-kyu reported to the headquarters that three American soldiers and four Syngman Rhee soldiers were staying in his house, drinking heavily, and asked the Guard to eliminate these enemies immediately.

It turned out that a large number of enemies stationed in the village that day had been transferred to Wonsan, and the seven enemies were new arrivals. At that time, Moon Bong-kyu had something to do and went back to the village, and happened to meet them. At that time, he couldn't wait to eliminate them immediately, but he quickly calmed down and asked them where they were going. When he learned that the enemies were eager to find a place to live, he led them to his own house and discussed it with his mother, letting them stay in the warm kang bed in the house, and also took out the wine that had been stored in the house for a long time, and killed the only hen to "entertain" them. How could these guys not like these things? Soon, they were all drunk. After everything was arranged, Moon Bong-kyu ran quickly to the headquarters to report.

The team studied the enemy's situation and decided to send Oh Joon-min and ten others to attack at night.

Late at night, these ten children set off according to the planned plan. Kim Young-duk walked in the front with a gun on his back, and Oh Joon-min walked at the end with a grenade clipped in his hand, stepping lightly and heading quickly towards the village. How familiar the road was, they knew exactly where there was a gap and where there was a tree. In the past, these children were a little afraid of even slaughtering chickens, who had ever killed anyone? Who had ever touched the darkness on such a night, even when they went home from school during the day, their mothers would greet them with smiles not far away? But now, they had become soldiers avenging the people, and they were going to attack the enemy.

At two o'clock in the night, they reached their destination and surrounded Moon Bong-kyu's house. Kim Young-duk took five children to the front door, and Oh Joon-min and Kim Byung-koo blocked the enemy's escape route. However, Kim Young-duk, twelve years old, who lacked combat knowledge, fired a shot first. Two Syngman Rhee soldiers, who were not too drunk, ran away without even taking their weapons when they heard the gunshot. But the children did not panic. They first caught the five drunk guys who were confused, and then chased after them with the enemy's guns, killing the two guys who had escaped less than two hundred meters away and were staggering. The little heroes, carrying the joy of their first victory, escorted five prisoners, and carried seven captured guns and hundreds of bullets on their backs, back to the headquarters.

On November 21st, they received an important message: on the 23rd, the enemy was going to shoot more than a hundred villagers who had been imprisoned. That night, they told Yoon Eung-ryong the news.

On the night of the 22nd, the Young Guard and the guerrilla team of 150 people entered Sincang-ri along the winding riverbank. At two o'clock in the night, the attack signal on the nameless high ground behind the village tore through the dark night sky. The big and small warriors rushed into the enemy's residence, opened the enemy's prison, released more than a hundred villagers, and at the same time annihilated more than a hundred American-Syngman Rhee bandits. They fought like this until Sincang-ri was liberated again, and the little heroes returned to their studies. In the two months of struggle, they achieved the brilliant results of eliminating thirty enemies and capturing ten rifles. The Korean people, in order to reward their good children and Kim Il-sung's good students, gave them an unforgettable memorial, renamed Sincang-ri "Victory Village", and gave them the glorious title of "National Model Young Pioneer".

Dear little friends, this is just a little bit of the heroic struggle stories of thousands of Korean teenagers. Now, they are marching towards the scientific fortress with their spirit of killing enemies and defending the country in various learning positions. When commemorating "June 1st" Children's Day, let us pay tribute to them, to the brave Korean children!

    给你们说一个朝鲜孩子们的英勇故事
    邹旭烱　黄静危
    亲爱的祖国小朋友们：
    你们现在正为着迎接自己的节日——“六一”国际儿童节忙着吧！而远在朝鲜的我们，也时常在怀念着你们，预祝你们能更好地度过自己的节日。这些天来，我们又不止一次地拿出了你们寄来的信件，重新读着那些充满热情的语句，看着像片上那些天真可爱的小脸，甚至带上了你们送给我们的红领巾……。为了满足你们几次来信中提出的要求，我们又特地到朝鲜东海岸的川内郡第三中学校，访问了“云林少年近卫队”的一部分孩子们。虽然他们和敌人英勇斗争的故事已经过去好久了，但今天写给你们，就觉得又有了新的意义。那是一九五○年的十月十四日，美李匪军的铁蹄踏进了川内郡的新仓里。一进村，他们就把完好的房子烧坏了，粮食抢走了。和平幸福的村庄，一下就变成了可怕的战争废墟。在这天，第三中学有三个年轻的同学，站在学校附近的江边，看着这种景象，眼里充满了热泪，牙齿紧咬着嘴唇。他们想起了五年来和平生活给他们的幸福，想起了五年前日本鬼子给他们幼小心灵的创伤，而今天他们又没有了学校，又没有了家，课堂上的桌凳和黑板正被烧得“拍拍”直响，自己的父母也被一批批地押进了村里的仓库……。终于，他们止住了泪，捏紧了小拳头，怀着满腔复仇的火焰，离开了自己亲爱的村庄，当晚，他们就跑到了离家二十多里的鹤岩山，住在一个小山洞里——这里，就成了他们近卫队的根据地，一支完全是孩子组成的游击队成长起来了。
    这三个孩子的名字是吴俊敏、赵贞熙和金荣德。吴俊敏最大，只有十四岁，可是多年来少年团给他们的教育，使他们知道，当祖国处在这样最困难的时刻，他们应该做些什么。他们很快地组织了起来，共推吴俊敏做领导，并定出了战斗口号：“为了保卫学校、故乡和祖国，坚决斗争下去，决不后退！”困难是很多的，他们没有粮食，没有武器，也没有斗争经验，但是，一切困难他们都慢慢克服了。他们在新山里的矿山找到了一百个雷管，从伪治安队员那里弄来了一枝步枪，几发子弹和一颗手榴弹，又从家里收集了一些剩余粮食。他们开始了自己的斗争。
    开始是散发传单，动员同学们参加他们的组织。传单发出去后，第一个到队里来的是金炳九，他还从学校的废墟里找到了油印机，带到队里来，从此，传单就从这个山洞里更多地飞到了新仓里的每一个角落，鼓动着更多的同学和里里的人民投入到斗争的行列中来。很快，他们的队伍就扩大到二十三人，并以他们所在地云林面正式命名为“云林少年近卫队”。很快，近卫队就和邻近文川郡的劳动党委员长尹应龙领导的游击队取得了联系。孩子们得到了党的直接领导，更坚定了他们的斗争信心。
    一天夜里，队员文凤奎回队部报告，说三个美国兵和四个李伪军住在他的家里，吃得大醉，要求近卫队立刻去消灭这些敌人。
    原来那天驻在村里的大批敌人都转移到元山去，那七个敌人是新来的。这时，文凤奎有事回村里去，一进村，恰好碰到了他们，当时，他恨不得马上把他们消灭掉，但很快又沉住了气，问他们要到那里去。当他知道敌人是急于要找房子住的时候，就把他们领到了自己的家里，并和自己的母亲商量好，把家里的暖炕让给他们住，还拿出了家里保存了很久的酒，又杀了仅有的一只母鸡，来“招待”他们。这些家伙，看到了这些东西怎不喜欢呢。很快，他们就都吃醉了。一切，都安排停当了后，文凤奎就飞快地跑到队部去报告。
    队里研究了敌人的情况，决定派吴俊敏等十人夜晚出击。
    夜深了，这十个孩子，按着研究好的计划出发了。金荣德背着枪走在前边，吴俊敏夹着个手榴弹走在后尾，踏着轻轻的脚步，飞快地向村里前进。道路多熟悉啊，哪地方有个缺口，哪地方有棵树，他们都记得清清楚楚。过去，这些孩子连宰鸡都有点害怕，谁杀过人呢？过去谁在这样的深夜里摸过黑呢，连白天放学回家，阿妈妮不是很远就笑着向他们招呼吗？可是，现在，他们成了为人民复仇的战士了，他们要去袭击敌人。
    夜两点，他们到达了目的地，包围了文凤奎的家。金荣德带着五个孩子走前门，吴俊敏、金炳九等分口堵住敌人的逃路。但是缺少斗争知识的十二岁的金荣德，却首先放了一枪，两个吃得还不太醉的李伪军，听到了枪声，连武器都没顾得带就逃走了。但是孩子们并没有慌，他们先把五个醉得迷迷糊糊的家伙抓了起来，然后又拿着敌人的枪追上了去，把那两个逃了还不到二百公尺远，东倒西歪的家伙打死了。小英雄们带着他们第一次胜利的喜悦，押着五个俘虏，背着缴来的七支枪，几百发子弹，回队部去了。
    十一月二十一日，他们得到了一个重要消息：二十三日敌人要枪杀一百多名被关押的老乡。当天晚上他们就把这一消息告诉了尹应龙。
    二十二日晚，少年近卫队和游击队一百五十人的队伍，沿着曲折的河畔，进入了新仓里。夜两点，村后无名高地的攻击信号，划破了黑暗的夜空，大小勇士们紧跟着冲进了敌人的住所，打开了敌人的监牢，放出了一百多名乡亲，同时还把一百多名美李匪军全部歼灭了。他们就这样斗争着，直到新仓里重新解放，小英雄们才回到自己的学习岗位上。在两个月的斗争中，他们获得了歼敌三十名，缴获步枪十支的辉煌战果。朝鲜人民为了奖励他们的好儿女，金日成的好学生，给了他们以永志不忘的纪念，把新仓里改名为“战胜里”，并分别给予他们以“全国模范少先队员”的光荣称号。
    亲爱的小朋友们，这就是千万个朝鲜少年英勇斗争故事中的一点点，现在，他们正在各种不同的学习岗位上，用他们杀敌卫国的精神，向科学堡垒进军。在纪念“六一”儿童节的时候，让我们一同向他们，向勇敢的朝鲜孩子们致敬吧！
