Xinhua News Agency, 28th: According to the Vietnam News Agency: in the French-occupied areas of Vietnam, the people's desire for peace is very strong. Recently, even military police who were originally sent by the French colonialists to suppress demonstrations participated in the peace demonstration held in Hue City.

　　On the morning of June 18th at 8 o'clock, 4,000 people held a peace rally in Hue City, which was occupied by French troops. The participants posted many slogans such as "Oppose the forced conscription of young people into the puppet army," "Oppose the prolongation of the war of aggression," "The French government should sincerely negotiate with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to restore peace," "Support the position and proposals adopted by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the Geneva Conference," and "Support the government led by President Ho Chi Minh."

　　The French colonialists and their puppets in Hue sent some armed police and European and African troops to suppress the demonstration. However, when the military police learned that the demonstration was for peace, they also demonstrated with the masses. The rally later turned into a large-scale demonstration, and residents on the street also joined, increasing the number of people to more than 10,000. The demonstration marched in the streets, shouting the following slogans: "Stop the Indochina war of aggression," "Realize peace in Indochina," and "Support the Ho Chi Minh government."

　　At 2 p.m., the demonstration split into groups to hold rallies in various places until dusk before dispersing.

　　In the French-occupied districts of Thủ Thừa and Cai Lậy in Mỹ Tho Province, South Vietnam, more than 20,000 people held rallies and demonstrations in the eleven days up to May 28, demanding that the French government sincerely negotiate with the government led by President Ho Chi Minh and support the position and proposals adopted by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the Geneva Conference.

　　In Hanoi, which is occupied by French troops, many workers, teachers, students, small merchants, and housewives also recently submitted petitions to the French government demanding peace.

    越南法占区人民纷纷举行集会和示威
    要求进行诚意协商实现印度支那和平
    【新华社二十八日讯】据越南通讯社消息：在越南的法军占领区，人们要求和平的愿望十分强烈。最近在顺化城举行的和平示威，甚至有原来被法国殖民者派去镇压示威的军警参加。
    六月十八日上午八时，在法军占领的顺化城，有四千人举行要求和平大会。到会的人张贴了“反对强征青年加入伪军”、“反对延长侵略战争”、“法国政府拿出诚意来和越南民主共和国政府进行协商恢复和平”、“支持越南民主共和国代表团在日内瓦会议上所采取的立场和建议”、“拥护胡志明主席领导的政府”等许多标语。
    法国殖民者和他们在顺化的傀儡派来了一些武装警察和欧非籍军队来镇压示威。但是当军警们知道示威是为了要求和平的时候，他们也和群众一起示威，大会后来变成了大规模的示威，街上的居民也参加进来，人数增加到一万以上。示威队伍在街上游行时高呼下面的口号：“停止印度支那侵略战争”、“实现印度支那和平”、“拥护胡志明政府”。
    到下午二时，示威队伍分成小组在各处集会，直到傍晚才散。
    在南越美萩省法军占领的守承、丐礼等县，到五月二十八日为止的十一天中，已有两万多人举行集会和示威游行，要求法国政府拿出诚意来和胡志明主席领导的政府谈判，支持越南民主共和国代表团在日内瓦会议上所采取的立场和建议。
    在法军占领的河内，许多工人、教师、学生、小商人和家庭妇女，不久以前也纷纷向法国政府提出了要求和平的请愿书。
