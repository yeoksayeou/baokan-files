    Consolidating Korean Peace
    --Commemorating the Fourth Anniversary of the Korean People's War Against Aggression and Welcoming the Korean People's Delegation to China

    Today marks the fourth anniversary of the heroic Korean people's resistance against the American aggression war. This war ended with the defeat of the American aggressors. The Korean people, with their historic victory, proved to the world that the Korean people, who dare to rise up to defend their national sovereignty and seek peaceful reunification of their motherland, are invincible; that the world's peace forces, which oppose wars of aggression and support international consultation, are infinitely powerful; and that the Korean issue can only be genuinely resolved through peaceful consultation based on respect for the Korean people's national rights.

    The realization of the Korean armistice has somewhat eased international tensions, allowed the Korean people to return to peaceful life, and opened the way for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The Korean people face a new task: to continue to uphold the implementation of the armistice agreement, strive for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and heal the serious wounds of war. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with the support of the world's peace and democratic forces, has admirably undertaken this task.

    For nearly a year, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have faithfully fulfilled and maintained the implementation of the armistice agreement. The Korean-Chinese side has waged a firm struggle against the U.S. side's perfidious acts of undermining the authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and obstructing the convening of the Korean political conference. The agreement reached at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference on convening the Geneva Conference to discuss the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue was supported by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Government of the People's Republic of China. The delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union made significant efforts during the Geneva Conference's discussion of the Korean issue. At the same time, throughout North Korea, economic recovery and construction work, with the selfless assistance of the socialist Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries, has achieved significant success. Comprehensive preparation and organization for the recovery and development of the people's economy have been successfully completed, and a large-scale three-year construction plan has begun. Industry, agriculture, and transportation are rapidly recovering, the people's peaceful lives have improved, and fifteen universities and all primary and secondary schools have resumed classes. The achievements of the North Korean people in peaceful labor further consolidate the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and inspire and attract the South Korean people, who groan under the enslavement of American imperialism and its running-dog, the Syngman Rhee clique, creating conditions for the peaceful reunification of their country by all Korean people.

    American imperialism is still unwilling to abandon its ambition to turn the whole of Korea into an American colony and a springboard for aggression against China. The Syngman Rhee clique has been constantly clamoring for a northward march to unify Korea. To realize this conspiracy, the U.S. side forcibly detained over 48,000 of our captured personnel; continuously violated the armistice agreement, transported large quantities of military supplies into South Korea, strengthened U.S.-Rhee military forces, and attempted to undermine or even cancel the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The United States has signed a so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with Syngman Rhee, attempting to station troops in South Korea indefinitely. The United States is stepping up the expansion of the Syngman Rhee army, planning to expand the Rhee puppet army to more than double its pre-armistice size. The South Korean people, who have suffered profound war disasters, continue to live in dire straits. To obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the United States, disregarding the utmost efforts made by the Chinese and Korean sides, unilaterally suspended the bilateral talks on convening the Korean political conference. Recently, the United States and its followers blatantly sabotaged the Geneva Conference negotiations on the Korean issue.

    In the course of the Geneva Conference's discussion of the Korean issue, two completely different positions and lines regarding the issue of restoring Korean national unification and peace were clearly revealed. The delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union participated in the Geneva Conference with a sincere desire to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and conducted patient consultations, putting forward a series of constructive proposals, hoping to restore Korean unification and consolidate Korean peace on a fair and reasonable basis. However, the purpose of the United States in participating in the Geneva Conference was only to obstruct and disrupt the conference, attempting to prove that a negotiated solution to the Korean issue was impossible, and stubbornly trying to keep the Korean issue as an unresolved international dispute in order to create world tension and prepare for a new war. Therefore, the U.S. delegation and its followers simply obliterated the national rights of the Korean people, insisted that the United Nations, a belligerent party, "supervise" elections throughout Korea, and attempted to extend the dictatorial rule of the Syngman Rhee clique to North Korea. They insisted on the unreasonable suggestion that American troops remain stationed in South Korea for a long time, while unilaterally demanding that the Chinese People's Volunteers withdraw from Korea. They stubbornly rejected all the just and feasible suggestions of the Korean, Chinese, and Soviet delegations, causing the conference to end without reaching any agreement.

    Obviously, the position taken by the United States on the Korean issue is untenable, and its line is unworkable. The American policy of "negotiating from strength" has already met a dead end in the Korean War. The fate of Korea is in the hands of the Korean people, and the Korean people's national aspirations for peaceful reunification and national independence are supported by peace-loving people all over the world. Although the United States has disrupted the discussion of the Korean issue, the Korean issue has not been removed from the agenda of international consultation. The reasonable suggestions and proposals put forward by the delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union have pointed out a clear path for striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    The urgent task now is to maintain a high degree of vigilance, at any time smash any new military adventures that the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique may launch, and resolutely uphold the implementation of the Korean armistice agreement in order to guarantee the Korean armistice and further promote the mutual approach of the people of North and South Korea, strive for the normalization of the Korean situation, and create favorable conditions for the peaceful reunification of Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteers still bear the solemn responsibility of maintaining the Korean armistice agreement, and the Chinese people will continue to defend Korean peace and Chinese security alongside the Korean people.

    The unbreakable friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean people is a powerful guarantee for consolidating peace in Korea and the Far East. The great and lofty internationalist fighting friendship forged by the Korean and Chinese people in the flames of the war against American aggressors is everlasting and constantly developing. After the Korean armistice, in maintaining the implementation of the armistice agreement, in the struggle for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and in the cause of peaceful construction in Korea, the people of the two countries have further demonstrated the spirit of strengthening mutual assistance and cooperation, and the prestige and position of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union have been further enhanced.

    Three months ago, the Chinese people welcomed the Korean People's Delegation to China with great joy. The outstanding representatives of the Korean people traveled all over our vast country, made extensive contact with people from all walks of life in our country, conveyed the friendly sentiments of the Korean people towards the Chinese people, and introduced the courage, tenacity, and heroism shown by the Korean people in the anti-aggression war and in the peaceful labor of restoring the national economy. The three Korean art troupes that came with the Korean People's Delegation to China performed wonderful programs in various parts of our country. This grand visit was warmly welcomed by the people of our country, greatly deepening the mutual understanding between the Chinese and Korean people, extensively exchanging the fighting experience, construction achievements, and culture and art of the two peoples, thereby further strengthening the profound traditional friendship between the two peoples. Now, as we bid farewell to the Korean People's Delegation to China, the Chinese people feel that this visit by Korean friends will become an unforgettable event in the lives of our people. We believe that after the Korean People's Delegation returns home, it will surely convey to the Korean people the Chinese people's enduring friendship with the Korean people.

    We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, and with the support of all peace-loving and freedom-loving people in the world, the just cause of the Korean people in striving for peaceful reunification, national independence, and democratic freedom will surely be victorious.

    巩固朝鲜的和平
    ——纪念朝鲜人民反侵略战争四周年并欢送朝鲜人民访华代表团
    今天是英雄的朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略战争的四周年。这一场战争，是以美国侵略者的失败而结束的。朝鲜人民以自己的历史性的胜利向全世界证明，敢于起来捍卫自己的民族主权和谋求祖国和平统一的朝鲜人民是不可被战胜的；反对侵略战争和拥护国际协商的世界和平力量是无限强大的，朝鲜问题只有在尊重朝鲜人民的民族权利的基础上进行和平协商，才能求得真正的解决。
    朝鲜停战的实现，使国际紧张局势得到了一些缓和，使朝鲜人民恢复了和平的生活，并为和平解决朝鲜问题开辟了道路。朝鲜人民面临着新的任务，这就是继续维护停战协定的实施，争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，并医治严重的战争创伤。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在世界和平民主力量的支持下，已经很好地把这个任务担当了起来。
    将近一年来，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军忠实地履行和维护停战协定的实施。朝中方面为反对美方破坏中立国遣返委员会的职权范围和阻挠朝鲜政治会议的召开的背信弃义行为，进行了坚定的斗争。柏林四国外长会议达成关于召开日内瓦会议讨论和平解决朝鲜问题的协议，获得了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府的支持。朝、中、苏三国代表团在日内瓦会议讨论朝鲜问题的期间作了重大的努力。同时，在整个朝鲜北部，经济恢复和建设工作，也在社会主义的苏联和各人民民主国家的无私援助下，获得了重大的成就。恢复和发展人民经济的全面的准备和整理工作已经胜利完成了，大规模的三年建设计划已经开始了。工农业和交通事业正在迅速恢复，人民的和平生活有了改善，十五所大学和全部中小学都已恢复上课。朝鲜北部人民和平劳动的成就，进一步巩固了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，鼓舞和吸引着呻吟在美国帝国主义及其走狗李承晚集团奴役下的南朝鲜人民，为全朝鲜人民和平恢复自己国家的民主统一创造着条件。
    美国帝国主义仍然不肯放弃它的把全朝鲜变为美国的殖民地和侵略中国的跳板的野心。李承晚集团一直叫嚣北进统一朝鲜。为了实现这个阴谋，美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员共达四万八千余名；不断违反停战协定，运送大量军事物资进入南朝鲜，加强美李军事力量，并企图破坏甚至取消中立国监察委员会的工作。美国已和李承晚签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，企图无限期驻兵南朝鲜。美国正在加紧扩充李承晚军队，计划要把李伪军扩充到停战前的一倍以上。遭受了深重的战争灾难的南朝鲜人民，继续生活在水深火热之中。为了阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，美国不顾中、朝方面所尽的最大努力，片面地中断了关于召开朝鲜政治会议的双方会谈。最近美国和它的追随者又悍然破坏了日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的谈判。
    在日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论的过程中，明显地显示出了对于恢复朝鲜国家的统一与和平问题上两种完全不同的立场和路线。朝、中、苏三国代表团怀着和平解决朝鲜问题的真诚愿望参加日内瓦会议，并进行了耐心的协商，提出了一系列的建设性建议，希望在公平合理的基础上恢复朝鲜的统一与巩固朝鲜的和平。但是，美国参加日内瓦会议的目的，只是为了要阻挠和破坏这个会议的进行，企图证明协商解决朝鲜问题不可能，硬要把朝鲜问题继续成为悬而未决的国际争端，以便制造世界紧张局势，准备新战争。因此，美国代表团及其追随者竟然一味抹煞朝鲜人民的民族权利，坚持要由交战一方的联合国来“监督”全朝鲜的选举，妄图把李承晚集团的独裁统治扩大到朝鲜北部。它们坚持美国军队长期留驻南朝鲜，而片面地要中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜的无理建议。它们顽固地拒绝了朝、中、苏代表团的一切公正可行的建议，使会议没有达成任何协议而结束。
    很显然，美国对朝鲜问题采取的立场是站不住的，它的路线是行不通的。美国的“从实力出发”的政策，已在朝鲜战争中碰了壁。朝鲜的命运已掌握在朝鲜人民的手里，朝鲜人民争取和平统一和民族独立的民族愿望得到全世界爱好和平人民的支持。美国虽然已破坏了朝鲜问题的讨论，但是朝鲜问题并没有从国际协商的议程上抹掉。朝、中、苏三国代表团所提出的合理建议和主张，已为争取和平解决朝鲜问题指出了明确道路。
    今后的迫切任务是，以高度的警惕性，随时粉碎美国和李承晚集团可能发动的新的军事冒险，坚决维护朝鲜停战协定的实施，以保证朝鲜停战，并进一步促进南北朝鲜人民的互相接近，争取朝鲜局势的正常化，为和平统一朝鲜创造有利的条件。中国人民志愿军现在仍然负有维护朝鲜停战协定的庄严责任，中国人民将继续和朝鲜人民并肩捍卫朝鲜的和平与中国的安全。
    中朝两国人民牢不可破的友谊和团结，是巩固朝鲜和远东和平的一个有力的保证。朝中人民在反对美国侵略者的战火中所结成的伟大的崇高的国际主义的战斗友谊，是永世长存，并不断发展的。朝鲜停战后，在维护停战协定的实施中，在争取和平解决朝鲜问题的斗争中，以及在朝鲜和平建设事业中，两国人民进一步表现了加强互助合作的精神，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的威望和地位得到了进一步的提高。
    三个月以前，中国人民以极大的喜悦心情欢迎了朝鲜人民访华代表团到我国进行访问。朝鲜人民的优秀的代表们走遍了我们辽阔广大的国家，和我国各界人民进行了广泛的接触，传达了朝鲜人民对中国人民的友好情谊，介绍了朝鲜人民在反侵略战争和恢复国民经济的和平劳动中所表现的果敢、刚毅和英雄气概。随朝鲜人民访华代表团而来的朝鲜三个艺术团体在我国各地演出了精彩的节目。这一盛情的访问，受到我国人民的热烈欢迎，大大地加深了中朝两国人民之间的互相了解，广泛地交流了两国人民的斗争经验、建设成就和文化艺术，从而进一步加强了两国人民的深厚的传统友谊。现在，在欢送朝鲜人民访华代表团归国之际，中国人民都感觉到，朝鲜朋友的这次访问将成为我国人民生活中的一件难忘的事件。我们相信，朝鲜人民访华代表团归国以后，也必然会把中国人民对朝鲜人民的永远不渝的友谊传达给朝鲜人民。
    我们深信，在朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅的领导下，在全世界爱好和平与自由的人民的支持下，朝鲜人民争取和平统一、民族独立与民主自由的正义事业必将获得胜利。
