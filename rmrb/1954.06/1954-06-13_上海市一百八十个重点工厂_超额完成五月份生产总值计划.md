Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 12th: Shanghai's 180 key state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories exceeded the state plan for gross output value in May by 3.32 percent.

Of the thirty major products produced by these factories, twenty-three, including steel, rolled steel, copper, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, metal-cutting machine tools, steam boilers, internal combustion engines, agricultural machinery, ships, ball bearings, general-purpose fans, bicycles, generators, electric motors, DC motors, bare copper wire, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, cigarettes, matches, plate glass, and sawn timber, have completed or exceeded the state-mandated production plan.

In May, many factories achieved new successes in the technical innovation movement. From May 1st to 21st, the employees of the state-owned Shanghai Turbine Factory proposed more than 100 suggestions for improving tools, operations, and equipment, and many of these suggestions have increased the production efficiency of the relevant parts by two or eleven times. The open-hearth steelmaking workshop of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Plant established a traffic control operation method. In May, it continuously set new records of blowing 106, 110, 111, 113, and 119 heats of steel per day.

Nineteen state-owned cotton textile factories worked hard to save cotton on the basis of improving quality. In May, each factory studied the experience of the state-owned Shanghai No. 16 Cotton Textile Factory in saving cotton, paid attention to the grading and classification of raw cotton, and adopted several technical measures in the opening and cleaning, carding, and other departments. Seven factories reduced cotton consumption compared to April.

Among the products produced by more than 30 factories in Shanghai affiliated with the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government, the quality of most products, such as penicillin, tablets, injections, medical equipment, soft drinks, candy, biscuits, and drawing paper, improved in April compared to the first quarter; in May, most products maintained the quality level of April, and some products were further improved.
