Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The 217th meeting of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government was held at 3:00 PM on May 20th. The meeting heard the "Report on Several Major Tasks of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government in 1953 and Key Points of Work for 1954" by Liu Geping, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, and the "Report on the Issue of Assisting Ethnic Groups Without Written Languages in Creating Writing Systems by the Guiding Committee for Research on Ethnic Languages ​​and Writing Systems of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Goverment and the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government" by Luo Changpei, Secretary-General of the Guiding Committee for Research on Ethnic Languages ​​and Writing Systems of Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and Member of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government.

In the report on the issue of assisting ethnic groups without written languages in creating writing systems, the Guiding Committee for Research on Ethnic Languages ​​and Writing Systems of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council and the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government analyzed the complex situation of the languages and writing systems of ethnic minorities in China and proposed solutions. The report pointed out that many ethnic minorities in China, mainly in the southwest and south-central regions, have their own languages but not their own writing systems. Based on the analysis of known materials, the languages of the ethnic minorities without writing systems can be roughly divided into the following seven situations: 1. The ethnic group lives relatively concentrated, and although there are different dialects, there is a dialect area that occupies an absolute advantage. 2. The same ethnic group is distributed in different regions, and the dialects differ greatly. 3. Ethnic groups have the same name, are distributed in different regions, the dialects diverge, and the language relationship remains to be studied. 4. Ethnic groups have different names, but their languages are basically the same, and the same writing system can be adopted. 5. Other ethnic groups whose languages are similar to the language of this ethnic group already have writing systems that can be used. 6. Although this ethnic group has its own language, most people are already familiar with a language of another ethnic group that is different from their own. 7. This ethnic group has a small population, and although it has its own language, it is willing to use a language and writing system that is different from its own.

The report then pointed out that due to the development of politics, economy, culture, and other aspects in recent years, ethnic groups without writing systems or without common writing systems are now urgently demanding a solution to the writing system problem. In order to meet the requirements of various ethnic minorities, the report, based on the above situation, put forward the following basic principles regarding the formulation of ethnic minority languages and writing systems: For ethnic groups that have their own languages but no writing system or no common writing system, according to their voluntary choice, after a certain period of investigation and research, they should be assisted in gradually formulating a phonetic writing system or assisted in choosing an existing suitable writing system. Before a writing system is formulated or selected and implemented, the ethnic minorities in question may continue to use Chinese or the writing systems of other ethnic groups in accordance with their original habits.

The report finally pointed out: All ethnic minorities have the freedom to develop their languages ​​and writing systems, and they all have the freedom to learn and use their ethnic languages ​​and writing systems. At the same time, people of all ethnic groups, whether they already have writing systems or not, who voluntarily learn and use Chinese or the languages ​​and writing systems of other ethnic groups, governments at all levels should provide guarantees and assistance, and all agencies, schools, groups, etc., should also provide assistance as much as possible and shall not discriminate against them.

After discussion, the meeting approved the "Report on Several Major Tasks of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government in 1953 and Key Points of Work for 1954" and the "Report on the Issue of Assisting Ethnic Groups Without Written Languages in Creating Writing Systems by the Guiding Committee for Research on Ethnic Languages ​​and Writing Systems of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council and the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government." The meeting decided to abolish the Guiding Committee for Research on Ethnic Languages ​​and Writing Systems of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council. In the future, the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences will be responsible for the work of assisting ethnic minorities in creating writing systems (including language surveys and writing system design). The Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government is responsible for determining the ethnic minority writing system schemes and other issues in the work. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government is responsible for experimenting with and promoting the determined writing systems in the school education of various ethnic groups. The people's governments of the relevant ethnic regions should lead the work of experimenting with and promoting the writing systems in their respective regions. The meeting also instructed the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government to carefully study the proposed methods for assisting ethnic groups without writing systems to create writing systems, then formulate a plan and formulate a specific plan for creating writing systems in one or two ethnic groups, and conduct pilot projects first. They should continue to understand the situation and summarize experience in a timely manner so that they can gradually proceed in other ethnic groups when the facts prove that these methods are indeed feasible and other conditions are relatively mature.

In addition, the meeting also approved various appointment and removal proposals.

    帮助尚无文字的民族创立文字
    政务院第二一七次政务会议责成科学院语言研究所等单位审慎研究订出方案
    【新华社四日讯】中央人民政府政务院第二百一十七次政务会议在五月二十日下午三时举行。会议听了中央人民政府民族事务委员会刘格平副主任委员所作的“中央人民政府民族事务委员会一九五三年的几项主要工作和一九五四年工作要点报告”和中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会民族语言文字研究指导委员会秘书长、中央人民政府民族事务委员会委员罗常培所作的“中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会民族语言文字研究指导委员会及中央人民政府民族事务委员会关于帮助尚无文字的民族创立文字问题的报告”。
    政务院文化教育委员会民族语言文字研究指导委员会和中央人民政府民族事务委员会，在关于帮助尚无文字的民族创立文字问题的报告中分析了中国少数民族语言文字的复杂情况，并提出了解决办法。报告指出我国的少数民族，主要是西南和中南地区的少数民族，很多是有自己的语言而没有自己的文字。就已知的材料加以分析，没有文字的各少数民族的语言，大致有以下七种情况：一、本民族比较聚居，方言虽有不同，但有占绝对优势的方言区的。二、同一民族分布在不同地区，方言差别较大的。三、民族名称相同，分布在不同地区，方言分歧，语言关系尚待研究的。四、民族名称不同，语言基本相同，可以采用同一文字的。五、与本民族语言相近的其他民族已有文字，可以使用的。六、本民族虽有自己的语言，但多数人已经熟悉一种与本民族语言不同的其他民族的语言的。七、本民族人口很少，虽然有自己的语言，但愿意使用一种与本民族语言不同的语言和文字的。
    报告接着指出，由于几年来政治、经济、文化等各方面的发展，没有文字的或没有通用文字的民族，现在迫切要求解决文字问题。为满足各少数民族的要求，报告根据上述情况，就有关制订少数民族语言文字问题，提出了如下的基本原则，即：对于有自己的语言而没有文字或没有通用文字的民族，根据他们的自愿自择，应在经过一定时期的调查研究之后，帮助他们逐步制订一种拼音文字，或帮助他们选择一种现有的适用的文字。在制定或择定一种文字推行之前，各该少数民族得依原有习惯沿用汉文或其他民族的文字。
    报告最后指出：各少数民族均有发展其语言文字的自由，也均有学习和使用其民族语言文字的自由，同时不论已有文字或还没有文字的各民族人民，凡是自愿学习和使用汉语汉文或其他民族语言文字者，各级人民政府均应予以保障和帮助，凡机关、学校、团体等亦均应尽可能予以帮助，并不得加以歧视。
    会议经过讨论，批准了“中央人民政府民族事务委员会一九五三年的几项主要工作和一九五四年工作要点报告”和“中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会民族语言文字研究指导委员会及中央人民政府民族事务委员会关于帮助尚无文字的民族创立文字问题的报告”，会议决定撤销政务院文化教育委员会民族语言文字研究指导委员会。今后关于帮助少数民族创立文字的工作（包括语言调查、文字设计工作等），由中国科学院语言研究所负责。少数民族文字方案的确定和工作中的其他问题，由中央人民政府民族事务委员会负责。对于已确定的文字在各民族学校教育中加以实验和推行的工作，由中央人民政府教育部负责。各有关民族地区的人民政府对本区的文字的实验和推行的工作，应加以领导。会议并责成中国科学院语言研究所和中央人民政府民族事务委员会对报告中提出的关于帮助尚无文字的各民族创立文字的办法加以审慎研究，然后拟订计划和订出在一两个民族中创立文字的具体方案，先行试办，并应继续了解情况，及时总结经验，以便在事实证明这些办法确实可行，而且其他条件也比较成熟时，逐渐地在别的民族中进行。
    此外，本次会议并通过了各项任免案。
