The Labor Competition at the Hungnam Chemical Factory

　　At the large-scale Hungnam Chemical Factory, several towering chimneys are already belching thick black smoke. Here, the workers are engaged in a fiery labor competition for the prosperity of the republic.

　　In the calcium carbide workshop, boiling calcium carbide solution pours down like a waterfall from various outlets. Below are iron pots capable of holding a ton of solution, which are quickly transported away after being filled. On the high roof, cranes are transporting the solidified calcium carbide to the crushing area, where it is broken into small pieces, packed into iron drums, and shipped throughout the country.

　　After the war, the workers made tremendous efforts to get the factory into production quickly. To produce calcium carbide, a lime factory had to be built first. Workers from the pipe-making workshop, machine workshop, civil engineering workshop, and two construction workshops all participated in this project. Soldiers from a unit of the Korean People's Army also joined in the construction. Coal briquettes are a necessary raw material for calcium carbide production. Lacking coal briquettes, the workers experimented with using coal powder instead, and the experiment was successful. In the heavy industry workshop and the calcium cyanamide workshop, the workers were also working selflessly. Workers led entirely by the Three Comrades in the heavy industry workshop replaced rock drills with winches in the electrode dismantling operation, completing the task thirteen days ahead of schedule. Workers in the calcium cyanamide workshop completed 300% of their work quota every day in order to complete the repair project ahead of schedule.

　　However, the enemy's destruction of this chemical factory was extremely extensive.

　　Factory Director Zhang Zhe said: Next year, all six original nitriding furnaces will be rebuilt, at which time 22,000 tons of calcium cyanamide can be produced annually. The year after next, all eight calcium carbide electric furnaces will also be put into production, capable of producing 50,000 tons of calcium carbide for the republic every year!

Produce More Grain for the Republic

　　Below Hwangchoryong in South Hamgyong Province, there is a village called Oro-eup. The Changjin River flows westward from the east of this village, merging with the Seongcheon River that flows around the front of the village. A vast plain is formed between the two rivers. The farmers of Oro-eup have established an agricultural production cooperative on this plain, setting a brilliant example for the development of the republic's agricultural economy.

　　This agricultural production cooperative was established after the war. The chairman of the cooperative is Zhu Luoyun, and the vice-chairman is Han Changmo. During the war, Zhu Luoyun achieved rare harvests in previous years through his own labor under the most difficult conditions. He also organized bumper harvest competition classes, mobilizing many farmers to embark on the path of mutual assistance and cooperation. In 1952, Han Changmo harvested 61.75 tons of potatoes per hectare, setting the highest record for potato production in the republic and earning the honorary title of "Model Farmer." The education of the Labor Party and the gradual development of the republic after the war made them understand that they must further organize to produce more grain for the country. Therefore, after the National Conference of Agricultural Activists last year, they mobilized farmers to organize an agricultural production cooperative. The cooperative has a total of seventeen households, planting 108 hectares of paddy fields, 67 hectares of dry land, and 1 hectare of mulberry fields. Last winter, the cooperative selected seeds, prepared sufficient fertilizer, and formulated this year's production plan. They plan to produce six tons of rice, 45 tons of potatoes, and 4 tons and 50 jin of millet per hectare.

　　In April, they had already invested in field production according to their plan. The cooperative members first dug out the boundary stones in the fields, leveled the weirs and ditches, and filled in the remaining bomb craters, connecting hundreds of hectares of land into one piece. The government of the republic sent tractors to plow the fields for them, and the cooperative members also began sowing potatoes and millet and making water paddy nurseries. They are working with incomparable excitement, determined to complete their production plan and produce more grain for the republic.

For the Arrival of International Friends

　　On the banks of the Taedong River in Pyongyang, a "Grand International Hotel" is being newly built, and more than 3,000 workers are engaged in a labor competition.

　　According to the design, the building occupies a total area of 7,200 square meters, of which the building foundation occupies 1,200 square meters. The exterior, corridors, and interior of the building will be adorned with beautiful carvings and murals, and the floors will be paved with excellent wood. Below the building is a spacious basement. On the first floor, there will be a dining hall that can accommodate 150 people, and VIP rooms and dance halls decorated with marble and murals, as well as a post office branch, reception room, and a store specializing in North Korean specialty products. From the second floor to the top floor are guest rooms. The largest has three rooms, and each room is equipped with an automatic telephone, electric bell, bathroom, toilet, and ventilation system. Each floor also has a reception room and a reading room. From behind the hotel all the way to the Taedong River, there will be a beautiful year-round evergreen garden where guests can stroll at will. According to plan, this building will be fully completed by April next year.

　　As early as January this year, when the earth was still covered in white snow and the soil was frozen, the workers were using explosives on the construction site to carry out the foundation digging project. In the center of the construction site, the winch emitted a sharp cry, winding up the fully loaded soil trucks. On both sides, heavy-duty wheeled earth movers were constantly transporting the excavated soil. On the ground, the piled-up soil, stones, sand, and cement bags looked like a great wall. In order to complete this huge project on schedule, the workers organized thirty work shifts, changing shifts three times a day, working day and night to carry out excavation operations. They broke through the plan of digging 1.2 cubic meters of soil per person per day, reaching 1.5 to 2 cubic meters, and the highest reached 3.6 cubic meters. On March 10, when Soviet-aided wheeled earth movers, winches, and other construction machines were transported to the construction site, the workers' labor enthusiasm was even higher. That evening, they convened a "Staff and Workers Mobilization Meeting," deciding to complete 10,000 cubic meters of excavation work ahead of schedule. Now, whenever these workers think of the beautiful six-story building that will appear on this land, and imagine the joyous scene of international friends standing on that spacious sundeck, overlooking the beautiful face of Pyongyang, they are even more courageously engaged in the labor competition.

    为重建祖国而斗争的朝鲜人民
    兴南化学工厂的劳动竞赛
    在规模巨大的兴南化学工厂里，几个高耸的烟囱，已经吐出了滚滚的黑烟。这里，工人们为着共和国的繁荣，正开展着火热的劳动竞赛。
    在电石车间里，沸腾着的电石溶液像瀑布般地从各流出口倾泻下来，下面是能容一吨溶液的铁锅，装满后，很快就被运走了。在很高的屋顶上，起重机正把凝固了的电石，向粉碎场运去，这里它又被打成小块，装进铁桶，运往全国各地。
    战后，工人们为了使工厂很快投入生产，曾做了极大的努力。要出产电石，就得首先修建石灰工厂，制管车间、机械车间、土木车间和两个建筑车间的工人们都投入了这一工程，朝鲜人民军某部的战士也参加了这一修建工程。煤球是电石生产中必需的原料，缺乏煤球，工人们就试用煤粉来代替，结果试验成功了。在重工车间，在石灰窒素车间，工人们同样进行着忘我的劳动。重工车间全用三同志领导的工人，在拆卸电极的作业中，用卷扬机代替了凿岩机，提前十三天完成了任务。石灰窒素车间的工人们，为了提前完成修复工程，每天都完成了工作定量的百分之三百。
    但是，敌人对这个化学工厂的破坏是极大的，
    厂长张喆说：明年，原有的六个窒化炉就会全部修建起来，那时每年可产石灰窒素两万二千吨。后年，八个电石电炉也将全部投入生产，每年能为共和国生产五万吨电石！
    给共和国增产更多的粮食
    在咸镜南道黄草岭下面，有一个村子叫五老邑，长津江的江水从这个村子的东部向西流去，和绕过村前流去的城川江汇合在一起。两江中间形成了广大的平原，五老邑的农民，就在这块平原上建立了农业生产合作社，为共和国的农业经济发展树立了光辉的榜样。
    这个农业生产合作社是在战后才建立的，合作社的委员长叫朱洛云，副委员长叫韩昌模。朱洛云在战争中最困难的条件下，曾以自己的劳动获得了历年稀有的丰收，他还组织了丰产竞赛班，发动许多农民走上互助合作的道路。韩昌模于一九五二年，曾在每公顷土地上收获了六十一吨七百五十公斤马铃薯，创造了共和国马铃薯产量的最高纪录，还获得了“模范农民”的光荣称号。劳动党的教育，共和国在战后的日趋发展，使他们懂得必须进一步组织起来为国家增产更多的粮食。于是，在去年全国农民积极分子大会以后，他们就发动农民组织了农业生产合作社。合作社共十七户，种着一百零八公顷水田、六十七公顷旱田和一公顷桑田。去年冬天，社内就选好了种子，准备了足够的肥料，并订出了今年的生产计划。他们计划：要在每公顷土地上生产六吨稻子，四十五吨马铃薯，四吨零五十斤谷子。
    四月间，他们已经按照自己的计划投入了田间生产。社员们首先挖去了田间的界石，平去了田间的堰沟，填平了残留的弹坑，把成百公顷的土地连成一片。共和国政府派去拖拉机给他们翻耕田地，社员们也着手进行马铃薯、谷子的播种和制作水秧苗圃。他们以无比兴奋的心情劳动着，决心要完成自己的生产计划，为共和国增产更多的粮食。
    为了国际友人的到来
    在平壤的大同江边，正在新建一幢“国际大旅社”的大厦，三千多工人正在开展着劳动竞赛。
    按照设计，大厦共占面积七千二百平方公尺，其中房屋地基占一千二百平方公尺。大厦的外部、走廊和室内，都将点缀以美丽的雕刻和壁画，地板将用优良的木料铺成。大厦的下面是宽敞的地下室，第一层楼里，将设有能容纳一百五十人的食堂，和用大理石、壁画装饰起来的贵宾室、舞厅，还有邮政分局、接待室和专卖朝鲜特产品的商店。从第二层到最上层楼都是客人住室，最大的有三间，每个住室都设有自动电话、电铃、沐浴室、厕所和换气装置。每层楼还专设有接待室和阅览室。从旅社后面起一直到大同江边，将是一个四季常青的美丽的庭园，客人可在这里随意游览。按照计划，这幢大厦到明年四月就要全部竣工。
    还在今年一月，大地还笼罩着白雪、土质结冻的时候，工人们就在工地上用炸药爆破，进行打基掘土工程。在工地中央，卷扬机发出尖锐的叫声，卷起满载的土车。两边，沉重的轮带运土机在不停地运送挖出来的泥土。地面上，堆积起来的泥土、石头、沙子和水泥袋，就好像一座长城。为了按期完成这一巨大的工程，工人们组织了三十个工作班，每天换班三次，日夜不停地进行掘土作业。他们突破了每人每天挖土一点二立方公尺的计划，达到了一点五到二立方公尺，最高的达到了三点六立方公尺。三月十日，苏联援助朝鲜的轮带运土机、卷扬机和其他建筑机器，运到了工地以后，工人们的劳动热情更加高涨。当晚，他们就召开了“职工奋起大会”，决定提前完成一万立方公尺的挖掘工程。现在，这些工人们每当想到在这块土地上将出现的美丽的六层大厦，想像着国际友人们将站在那宽敞的晒台上，眺望着平壤市美丽的面貌的欢乐情景时，就更加奋勇地进行着劳动竞赛。
