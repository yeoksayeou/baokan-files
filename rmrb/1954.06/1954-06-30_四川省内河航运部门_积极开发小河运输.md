The inland water transport department of Sichuan Province is actively developing small river transportation. In the past three years, the province has opened eight small river routes including the Baitiao River and the Lueyang River, with a total length of 868 kilometers, connecting the waterway transportation of Guanxian, Chongning, Pixian, Tongjiang, Lueyang, Linshui and other counties. For example, the Lueyang River had not been navigable for decades. After four months of blasting reefs, digging out submerged rocks, repairing towpaths, and building wooden bridges, it is now able to handle wooden boats of 14 tons. It undertakes the transportation of approximately 60,000 tons of materials and grain each month, supporting the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. At the same time, the opening of river channels has also helped the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. For example, after the renovation of the Baitiao River, it can transport about 45,000 tons of tobacco leaves, hemp, asbestos, and grain annually, and transport about 5,500 tons of daily necessities. Based solely on the difference between the past freight rates for automobiles, human-powered carts, and wooden boats, it can save more than 3.2 billion yuan in freight costs each year.

    四川省内河航运部门
    积极开发小河运输
    四川省内河航运部门积极开发小河运输。三年来，全省共开辟柏条河、略阳河等八条小河航路，全长八六八公里，沟通了灌县、崇宁、郫县、通江、略阳、邻水等县的水路交通。如略阳河已数十年不通航，经过四个月的炸礁、淘挖印石、修縴道、搭木桥后，现在已能通航十四吨的木船，每月担负了约六万吨的材料和粮食的运输工作，支援宝成铁路的建筑。同时，由于河道通航，也帮助了城乡物资的交流。如柏条河经整治后，每年约可运出烟叶、大麻、石棉、粮食等四万五千吨，运进日用品约五千五百吨。单以过去汽车、人力板车运价和木船运价的差价计算，每年即可节约运费三十二亿余元。
