Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 24th: According to a report in the New York "Daily Worker," Mei Santian, the publisher of the "Meizhou Huaqiao Ribao" (China Tribune), who was unreasonably sentenced to two years in prison by a US court, issued a statement on the 16th denouncing the verdict as an act of political persecution and a threat to freedom of the press.

The statement said: The persecution of the "Meizhou Huaqiao Ribao" was carried out through collusion between the Committee for Free Asia and certain forces within the US government. This verdict is a threat to newspapers and newspaper editors who dare to express disagreement with policies that would lead the United States to war. The enemies of the "Meizhou Huaqiao Ribao" want to stifle this newspaper, but it will continue to publish and continue to promote policies of peace between the people of China and the United States. Mei Santian finally stated that he would appeal against the unreasonable judgement of the US court.

    “美洲华侨日报”社长梅参天
    斥责美国法院的无理判决
    【新华社柏林二十四日电】据纽约“工人日报”报道，被美国法院无理判处两年徒刑的“美洲华侨日报”社长梅参天在十六日发表谈话，指责这一判决是政治迫害行为和对新闻出版自由的威胁。
    声明说：对“美洲华侨日报”的迫害是援华院外团和美国政府中某些势力勾结起来进行的。这一判决是对敢于表示不同意会把美国导向战争的政策的报纸和报纸编辑的威胁。“美洲华侨日报”的敌人想扼杀这家报纸，但是，它将继续出版，并继续宣扬中美两国人民间和平的政策。梅参天最后表示将对美国法院的无理判决提出上诉。
