    Northwest Textile Industry Bureau Affiliated Factories Conserve Cotton
    An Average of About Two and a Half Jin of Cotton Saved per Cotton Yarn Piece
    From January to May, the cotton textile factories affiliated with the Northwest Textile Industry Bureau saved an average of about two and a half jin of raw cotton per cotton yarn piece compared to last year. If this situation can be stabilized, the factories will use a total of more than 370,000 jin less raw cotton this year than last year. If calculated based on the average cotton field yield in Shaanxi Province last year, the raw cotton saved throughout the year is equivalent to the harvest from about 10,000 mu of cotton fields.
    Since the first quarter of this year, the factories affiliated with the Northwest Textile Industry Bureau have regarded conserving cotton as one of their central tasks. The factories' employees have researched dozens of technical measures to conserve cotton, strengthening the function of the opening and cleaning machines and carding machines in removing impurities and recovering effective fibers. Many factories have also come up with methods to utilize chopper waste and fly waste, reducing the amount of cotton used. For example, the Shaanxi Second Cotton Textile Factory successfully trial-produced a fiber impurity separator in April and May this year, which can save 235 jin of raw cotton per day. The state-owned Northwest First Cotton Textile Factory also successfully trial-produced a fiber impurity separator in May, which can save two jin of raw cotton per yarn piece. Now, according to the instructions of the Northwest Textile Industry Bureau, the factories are manufacturing or preparing to manufacture fiber impurity separators; after all factories adopt this machine, they can save more than 200,000 jin of raw cotton this year.

    西北纺织工业管理局所属各厂节约用棉
    每件棉纱平均约少用二斤半棉花
    西北纺织工业管理局所属各棉纺织厂从一月到五月份，每件棉纱平均比去年约少用二斤半原棉。这种情况如能稳定下来，今年各厂将比去年共少用原棉三十七万多斤。如以陕西省去年棉田平均产量计算，全年节约的原棉约等于一万亩左右棉田的收获量。
    从今年第一季度以来，西北纺织工业管理局所属各厂就把节约用棉当作中心工作之一。各厂职工在节约用棉方面研究出几十项技术措施，加强清花机、梳棉机的排除杂质和回收有效纤维的作用。许多厂还想出了利用斩抄花和落棉的办法，使用棉量减少。如陕西第二棉纺厂在今年四、五两月份，试制纤维杂质分离机成功，每天就可节省原棉二百三十五斤。国营西北第一棉纺织厂在五月份也试制成功了一部纤维杂质分离机，每件纱可节约原棉两斤。现在各厂根据西北纺织工业管理局的指示，正在制作或准备制作纤维杂质分离机；各厂都采用这种机器后，今年还能多节约原棉二十多万斤。
