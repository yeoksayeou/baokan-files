An People's Liberation Army soldier guarding a factory captured a special agent attempting to sabotage the factory.

Near this factory, there were many small stalls selling peanuts and cigarettes. One day, while soldier Zhang Guolin was on duty, a vendor tried to solicit business from Zhang Guolin. Zhang Guolin said "Thank you" but remained focused on surveying the surroundings. He looked at the factory wall, the coal pile under the barbed wire, and the small stalls. Suddenly, Zhang Guolin noticed that the new vendor, who had just tried to sell him something, kept looking into the factory. His clothing and movements seemed somewhat peculiar compared to the other vendors.

From then on, Zhang Guolin carefully observed the vendor every day while on duty, and he didn't relax his vigilance in other areas either. He noticed that the new vendor didn't set up his stall regularly, arrived later than the others, and was particularly attentive whenever workers bought something. He always inquired about the factory's internal affairs. All of this made Zhang Guolin even more suspicious, and he reported the matter to the company's political instructor. As time went on, it became clear that the vendor was indeed suspicious. His movements weren't those of a seasoned salesman, and he didn't care if he gave a little extra weight when selling peanuts. Zhang Guolin bought things from him several times, and the vendor generously refused to take small change, as if he didn't depend on making a living from sales. He also pretended to care about the workers, indirectly saying, "That big building that's always making a racket, it should have more windows. It's dark inside, and it's hard on the workers' eyes. Comrade, what kind of machines are in there? Tell me, so I can learn something." Zhang Guolin reported all the information he gathered each day to the political instructor, who instructed Zhang Guolin to pay close attention.

One night, Zhang Guolin quietly patrolled around the factory, carefully inspecting every corner. It was late, and there was no one outside the factory. The machines in the workshop were still running non-stop. Suddenly, he noticed a figure moving near the coal pile under the barbed wire. Zhang Guolin immediately became alert, and he quietly ran to the guardhouse to tell Wang Shucai and Liu Yushu, who were on duty. After they discussed it, Zhang Guolin and Wang Shucai headed in different directions toward the place where they had spotted the figure. Zhang Guolin saw someone just crawling into the barbed wire, and he shouted, "Don't move!" When the person saw someone, he hurriedly retreated, intending to escape. "Nowhere to run!" Wang Shucai blocked him outside the barbed wire.

The fellow made up a story, saying, "Comrade, my family is really struggling, and I came to steal coal. Look, isn't this a basket?" He held up the basket, trying to use stealing coal to cover up his crime. Zhang Guolin recognized his voice as familiar and, taking a closer look, realized it was the suspicious vendor. At this time, the company commander arrived with a squad of soldiers, and they took the fellow to the company headquarters and found two large bottles of gasoline under the coal in the basket he had brought. Later, after repeated interrogation, it was confirmed that this fellow was a special agent who was going to set fire to the factory.

    机警的战士
    刘树林
    警卫某工厂的解放军某部战士，捕捉了一名企图破坏工厂的特务。
    在这个工厂附近，有许多卖花生、香烟的小摊贩。有一天，正当战士张国林站岗的时候，一个小贩向张国林兜揽生意。张国林说了声“谢谢你”，依然全神贯注地巡视着四周。他有时看看工厂的围墙，有时看看铁丝网下的煤堆，有时也看看那些小摊贩。忽然，张国林发现刚才向他兜揽生意的、新来的小贩，老是向工厂里面看，衣着和动作跟一般的小摊贩比起来，好像也有点特殊。
    从这以后，张国林每天站岗时便细心地观察那个小贩，同时更不放松其他方面的警戒。他发现那个新来的小贩摆摊不经常，比别人来得也晚，一有工人买东西，他格外殷勤，而且总是打听工厂内部的情况。这一切，使张国林更加怀疑了，他就把这件事报告给连队的政治指导员。时间一长，发觉那个小贩实在可疑，买卖人那套动作一点也不熟练，卖花生的时候多几两也不在乎。张国林好几次买他的东西，给他钱的时候，小贩大方地不要零头钱，好像不是靠做买卖维持生活。他还假装很关心工人，拐弯抹角地说：“那个整天忽隆着响的大房子，该多开几个窗户，里面光线暗，工人做工累眼。同志，那里面是什么样的机器呀？你说说叫咱也开开窍。”张国林把每天得到的材料都向政治指导员报告。政治指导员也嘱咐张国林多加注意。
    有一个夜晚，张国林悄悄地在工厂四周巡逻，谨慎地巡视着每一个角落。夜深了，厂子外边冷清清的一个人也没有，车间里的机器还在不停地响着。忽然，他发现在铁丝网下的煤堆附近，有一个人影晃动。张国林马上警惕起来，他轻轻地跑到岗楼里告诉正在站岗的王树财和刘玉书。他们三个人商量后，张国林就和王树财分头奔向刚才发现人影的地方。张国林看到一个人刚钻进铁丝网，他就大喊一声：“不准动！”那个人一见有人就连忙向外退，打算逃跑。“那里跑！”王树财在铁丝网外堵住了。
    这个家伙顺嘴胡编说：“同志，家里生活实在困难，我是来偷煤的，你看，这不是筐？”他举起筐子，想假借偷煤来掩盖他的罪行。张国林听他说话的声音有点熟，仔细一看，原来就是那个可疑的小贩。这时候，连长带着一个班的战士也来了，就把这个家伙带到了连部，并且从这个家伙带来的筐子里的煤下面搜出了两大瓶汽油。后来经过反复侦讯证实这个家伙是一个要来放火烧工厂的特务。
