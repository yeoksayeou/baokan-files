Report on the Current Basic Situation and Future Work Plan of the Textile Industry by the Central Ministry of Textile Industry
(Approved by the 207th Plenary Session of the Government Administration Council)

In terms of production development, comparing the national textile industry's main product output in 1953 with that of 1949: cotton yarn increased by 226.32 percent, cotton cloth (excluding dyeing and finishing cotton mills) by 275.91 percent, gunny bags by 601.29 percent, and daily-use woolen textiles by 106.39 percent. Other products such as printed and dyed fabrics, spun silk textiles, knitwear, silk, and satin also had considerable growth. Compared with the highest annual output in Chinese history, except for a few products like woolen textiles and silk, which have been affected by raw materials and sales, the rest have exceeded the historical peak. Cotton yarn exceeded it by 69.96 percent, cotton cloth by 100.1 percent, and gunny bags by 67.64 percent. The types and quality of products have also been improving and increasing year by year.

Since 1950, the state has started to build new factories successively in some inland areas and has carried out reasonable renovation and expansion of some existing factories. In 1953, the number of spindles nationwide increased by 14.04 percent compared with 1949, of which inland spindle equipment increased by 49.78 percent compared with 1949. This began to change the unreasonable situation of the original textile industrial equipment being concentrated in coastal areas, bringing factories closer to raw material production areas and the vast inland market.

Before liberation, all equipment of China's textile industry had to rely on foreign imports, and the original few small-scale machinery factories could only carry out simple repairs and fittings. After liberation, through adjusting equipment, expanding factory buildings, organizing professional division of labor, and building the state-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant, we have been able to manufacture complete sets of textile machinery and equipment independently. We are currently designing and trial-producing higher-performance textile machines, and the equipment needed for new textile factories in the future can be self-supplied.

With the development of production, the ranks of textile workers have expanded. Among the existing employees of textile enterprises nationwide, state-owned (excluding central-local joint ventures) account for 216,560 people, an increase of 68 percent compared with 1950. On the basis of developing production, various measures have been actively taken to improve factory working conditions and improve workers' lives. In the past four years, the state has done a lot of work in concentrating on solving the main problems of labor protection in textile factories—cooling, dust removal, and safety devices—which not only improved workshop working conditions and promoted the health of employees, but also improved production. In terms of improving employee welfare, the state has built many dormitories, nurseries, hospitals, clinics, health rooms, and maternal and child health stations in the past four years. In terms of cultural and educational facilities, due to the development of spare-time cultural and technical education, the cultural and technical level of workers has been considerably improved, and a large number of outstanding textile workers have been transferred to workers' and peasants' accelerated middle schools, textile industry schools, and even textile engineering colleges to study. At the same time, through various movements such as democratic reform and production reform in the past few years, the political consciousness of the vast number of employees has been raised, and a large number of model workers and advanced workers have emerged.

Due to the development of state-owned textile industry production and the increase in equipment, the proportion of socialist and capitalist components in the textile industry has undergone major changes. Taking spindle equipment as an example, in 1949, state-owned textile enterprises only accounted for 47.61 percent of the country, while private textile enterprises accounted for 52.39 percent. However, by 1953, state-owned and joint state-private textile enterprises had increased to 64.8 percent, while private textile enterprises relatively decreased to 35.2 percent. The proportion of socialist components has been growing year by year, thereby strengthening and consolidating the leading position of the state-owned textile industry in the textile industry. However, looking at the absolute figures of output, private textile industry has also grown. For example, the cotton yarn production of private textile mills in 1953 increased by 51.07 percent compared with 1949.

While the state-owned strength has grown, the proportion of state capitalist components has also grown. In 1953, the number of spindles in joint state-private ventures increased by 87.27 percent compared with 1949. In addition to joint state-private enterprises, the state has also implemented unified allocation of major textile raw materials such as cotton, raw hemp, and wool since 1950, and has adopted unified purchase, processing orders, or exclusive sales for its products. This has solved the various difficulties encountered by the private textile industry during the recovery period and enabled them to gradually embark on the path of state capitalism, bringing them into the national plan to varying degrees, generally overcoming blindness and the anarchic state of production.

Regarding the overall tasks of the textile industry in the future, the report pointed out: "According to the state's overall tasks during the transition period and the situation of the textile industry, the overall tasks of the textile industry in the future are: to give full play to the potential of enterprises on the basis of continuously improving enterprise management, improving technical level, and reasonably improving and adjusting existing equipment; to build new factories in raw material production areas in a planned manner according to needs and possibilities; to gradually realize the socialist transformation of capitalist textile industry, and ensure the continuous growth of the proportion of the socialist economy. Strive to develop the textile industry from all aspects to meet the growing needs of the people, and continuously improve labor productivity, save raw materials, and reduce costs, to accumulate funds for national industrialization."

The report further provided a concrete explanation of this overall task. The report pointed out: First, the supply of textiles is related to the lives of everyone in the country, that is, to the connection between the state and the people. Therefore, the most fundamental issue that the textile industry needs to consider at present, that is, its fundamental task, is how to meet the growing needs of urban and rural people. According to the growth of per capita consumption of machine-woven cotton cloth over the past few years, as well as the future development of industrial and agricultural production, and the increase in income of workers and peasants, it is estimated that in the next few years, the consumption of yarn and cloth will greatly increase. Therefore, in addition to giving full play to the potential of existing enterprises, the state-owned textile industry still needs to build and expand a considerable number of spindles, as well as corresponding weaving equipment and printing and dyeing equipment, during the first five-year plan, according to needs and possibilities. In the future basic construction plan, the problem of uneven regional distribution must be gradually solved, so that factories are close to raw material production areas and the inland market, and safety is ensured. At the same time, the imbalance between spinning, weaving, and dyeing equipment should be solved. As for wool, hemp, silk, knitwear, artificial fiber, etc., equipment should be appropriately increased according to needs and possibilities, and a foundation should be laid for future development.

Second, in order to improve the quality of state-owned textile products and increase varieties and colors, the Central People's Government Ministry of Textile Industry has successively formulated draft unified quality standards for cotton yarn, cotton cloth, printed and dyed products, etc., which are currently being piloted in key state-owned factories. While improving the quality of textile products and increasing varieties and patterns, attention should also be paid to reducing product costs. In the future, it is still necessary to vigorously strengthen the conservation of raw cotton and other raw materials, strengthen quota management, and practice strict economy from non-production expenditures to reduce product costs. In textile industry enterprises, safe production and labor protection are of great significance. We should continue to solve workshop cooling equipment and dust removal equipment, add safety devices, and pay attention to the special labor protection of female workers. These measures are not only necessary for the physical health and production mood of employees, but also necessary for improving production efficiency and improving product quality.

Third, according to the state's overall tasks during the transition period, under the requirement of developing production and guaranteeing needs, continuing to strengthen the leadership of the private textile industry and carrying out socialist transformation is still an important task of the textile industry department. To this end, we should cooperate with relevant departments to develop state capitalism in a planned manner and gradually expand the scope of joint state-private ventures; for those that do not yet have the conditions for joint state-private ventures, or are too small in scale, we should expand the scope of processing orders in a planned manner to strengthen the state's leadership in production and sales.

The report then put forward the guidelines and tasks of the textile industry in 1954. The report first emphasized the importance of completing this year's national plan. Comparing this year's production plan for major textile industry products with 1953: cotton yarn increased by 11.77 percent, cotton cloth increased by 12.6 percent, printed and dyed fabrics increased by 23.53 percent, gunny bags increased by 5.19 percent, daily-use woolen textiles increased by 15.3 percent, and other textiles also had appropriate increases. Among them, the total output value of the state-owned textile industry (excluding local state-owned and joint state-private) increased by 12.7 percent compared with 1953; various major products have increased; the cost plan is 1.1 percent lower than in 1953; labor productivity is 3.1 percent higher than in 1953; and the basic construction plan increased by 111.66 percent in workload and 117.87 percent in construction area compared with 1953. These include the continued construction of state-owned Northwest Third Cotton Textile Mill, state-owned Beijing First Cotton Textile Mill, state-owned Shijiazhuang First Cotton Textile Mill, state-owned Zhengzhou First Cotton Textile Mill, and Xinjiang July 1st Cotton Textile Mill, and the new construction of state-owned Zhengzhou Third Cotton Textile Mill, state-owned Beijing Second Cotton Textile Mill, state-owned Shijiazhuang Second Cotton Textile Mill, and state-owned Northwest Fourth Cotton Textile Mill.

The report then pointed out: "According to the requirements of the textile industry's first five-year plan and the tasks and existing problems in 1954, the overall guidelines and tasks of the textile industry in 1954 are: to continue to strengthen planned management and implement operational plans as the center, and further strengthen technical management and promote advanced experience around this center; to establish and implement the factory director responsibility system and the production area management system and its related responsibility systems step by step, further improve labor organization, and carry out labor competition in depth; vigorously train cadres; strengthen financial cost management, and gradually implement the economic accounting system, to improve the enterprise management level, in order to achieve the goals of increasing production, improving quality, practicing strict economy, reducing costs, and improving labor productivity, and completing and overfulfilling the 1954 national plan."

Under this overall guideline task, the report made the following arrangements for the work in 1954: First, in terms of improving enterprise management: first, continue to strengthen planned management and promote operational plans. Establish production scheduling work in enterprise units and replenish the necessary personnel. In addition, we should also strengthen original record statistics and quota work. Second, strengthen the leadership of technical work. First, focus on saving raw materials, improving quality, and reducing downtime, and strengthen technical organizational measures. Second, we should carry out rationalization proposals and promote advanced experience in a purposeful and organized manner, and implement machine inspection and maintenance systems. Third, on the basis of strengthening various technical measures, we should continuously improve varieties, improve product quality, strengthen the design and trial production of new varieties, and expand the utilization of raw material resources. Third, this year, state-owned textile enterprises across the country should implement the factory director responsibility system and the production area management system to overcome the current phenomenon of multiple enterprise leadership and no one being responsible. Fourth, strengthen basic construction leadership: The first is to strengthen design work, ensure that the design tasks are completed in accordance with the scheduled design progress, and strive to submit drawings early so that construction can begin as soon as possible. At the same time, improve site management and improve project quality. In the supply of textile machinery for new factories, the main task is to concentrate efforts on the design of printing and dyeing machines and new cotton textile machines, and continue to improve quality and reduce costs. Fifth, while implementing the central work, we should strengthen the management of financial costs and gradually implement the economic accounting system. Sixth, vigorously train cadres, the methods are: strengthen the leadership of schools; use the method of adding deputy positions, and running more formal cadre schools, technical schools, and planned rotational training to train various technical, business cadres and skilled workers, especially those that are currently most lacking, such as printing and dyeing, cotton textile machinery, and electrical maintenance workers. Seventh, regarding state capitalism, this year, we should reorganize and consolidate the original joint state-private factories; under the unified leadership of the local party committees and governments, and according to needs, possibilities, and the principle of voluntariness, carry out joint ventures with several private factories; strengthen investigation and research on various industries and various enterprises, clarify the situation, and prepare for the future expansion of joint state-private ventures. For state capitalist enterprises that are currently in the middle and low-level forms, we should strengthen contact and continue to provide more assistance in business, technology, and management.

The report finally said: In order to ensure the smooth progress of all work, we should continue to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity and education work on the state's overall tasks during the transition period among the broad masses of employees, and constantly encourage political enthusiasm and improve awareness, so that it becomes the political driving force for promoting the completion and overfulfillment of various tasks. Leading cadres at all levels should especially strengthen political study and business study, deeply understand the spirit and essence of the general line, and often use this as a yardstick to check work and summarize experience; we must study the theory and advanced experience of Soviet socialist economic construction, and overcome blindness in our work; we must advocate learning technology, learning to manage socialist industry, advocate studying business, and establish a style of learning and studying. All employees of the textile industry, especially leading cadres at all levels, should further strengthen unity, carry out criticism and self-criticism, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, strive to overcome shortcomings in their work, and continuously improve the management level and leadership level of enterprises, and strive to complete and overfulfill the national plan!

    中央纺织工业部关于纺织工业目前基本情况和今后工作部署的报告
    （政务院第二百零七次政务会议批准）
    在生产的发展方面，一九五三年全国纺织工业主要产品的生产量和一九四九年比较：棉纱为百分之二百二十六点三二，棉布（不包括染整棉织厂）为百分之二百七十五点九一，麻袋为百分之六百零一点二九，日用毛纺织品为百分之一百零六点三九，其余印染布、绢纺织品、针织品、丝、绸等也都有相当的增长。如和我国历史上最高年产量比较，除极少数产品如毛纺织品、丝绸等因原料和销路影响，尚未达到历史上最高年产量外，其余都已超过。如棉纱超过了百分之六十九点九六，棉布超过了百分之一百点一，麻袋超过了百分之六十七点六四。产品的种类和质量也逐年有所改善和提高。
    从一九五零年起，国家开始在内地某些地区陆续建设了新厂，并对部分现有工厂进行了合理的改造和扩建。一九五三年全国纱锭数比一九四九年增加了百分之十四点零四，其中内地纱锭设备比一九四九年增加了百分之四十九点七八，这就开始改变着原有纺织工业设备集中在沿海地区的这一不合理状况，使工厂更接近原料产地和内地广大市场。
    解放以前，我国纺织工业的全部设备都须仰赖国外进口，原有几个规模不大的机器厂只能作简单的修配工作。解放以后，经过调整设备、扩建厂房、组织专业分工，同时新建了国营经纬纺织机械制造厂，已能自制全套纺织机器设备。目前正在设计和试制较高性能的纺织机器，今后新建纺织厂所需设备，已可自给。
    随着生产的发展，纺织工人的队伍扩大了，全国纺织企业现有职工中国营（不包括中央公私合营）占二十一万六千五百六十人，和一九五零年比较，增加了百分之六十八。在发展生产的基础上，积极进行了改善工厂劳动条件，提高工人生活的各种措施。四年来国家在集中解决纺织厂劳动保护的主要问题——降温、除尘、安全装置等方面曾作了许多工作，不仅改善了车间劳动条件，增进了职工健康，而且也提高了生产；在改善职工福利方面，四年来国家建立了许多宿舍、托儿所、医院、诊疗所、保健室、妇婴保健站等；在文化教育设施方面，由于业余文化技术教育的开展，工人的文化技术程度有了相当提高，并且还抽调了大批优秀的纺织工人到工农速成中学、纺织工业学校以至纺织工学院去学习。同时，经过几年来民主改革和生产改革等各项运动，提高了广大职工的政治觉悟，涌现出大批的劳动模范和先进工作者。
    由于国营纺织业生产的发展和设备的增加，纺织工业中社会主义成分和资本主义成分的比重起了重大的变化，以纱锭设备为例，一九四九年社会主义的国营纺织企业仅占全国的百分之四十七点六一，而私营纺织企业占百分之五十二点三九，但到一九五三年国营和公私合营纺织企业已增加到百分之六十四点八，而私营纺织企业相对地降低到百分之三十五点二，社会主义成分的比重是逐年增长了，从而加强和巩固了国营纺织工业对纺织工业的领导地位。但如以产量的绝对数字来看，私营纺织工业也有增长，例如私营纺织厂的棉纱生产量一九五三年比一九四九年增加了百分之五十一点零七。
    在国营力量增长的同时，国家资本主义成分的比重也有增长，一九五三年公私合营的纱锭比一九四九年增加了百分之八十七点二七。除了公私合营企业以外，国家还从一九五零年起对棉花、原麻、羊毛等主要纺织原料，实行了统筹分配，对其产品也分别采取了统购、加工订货或包销等办法，这样就解决了私营纺织业在恢复时期所遇到的各种困难，并使它们逐步走上国家资本主义的道路，在不同程度上纳入了国家计划的轨道，一般地克服了盲目性和生产的无政府状态。
    关于纺织工业今后总的任务，报告指出：“根据国家在过渡时期的总任务和纺织工业的情况，纺织工业今后总的任务是：在不断改善企业管理、提高技术水平和合理改进、调整现有设备的基础上，充分发挥企业的潜在力量；根据需要和可能，在原料产区有计划地建设新厂；逐步地实现国家对资本主义纺织业的社会主义改造，保证社会主义经济比重不断增长。从各方面努力发展纺织工业，以满足人民日益增长底需要，并不断地提高劳动生产率，节约原材料，降低成本，为国家工业化积累资金。”
    报告进一步对这个总的任务作了具体的说明。报告指出：第一，纺织品的供应是关系着全国每一个人的生活，也就是关系着国家和人民群众的联系，因而纺织工业目前需要考虑的最根本的问题，也就是它的根本任务，是如何满足城乡人民日益增长的需要。根据过去几年全国平均每人每年机织棉布的消费量增长情况，以及今后工农业生产的发展，工人、农民收入的增加等因素估计，在今后几年内，纱、布消费量将大大增长，因此，除充分发挥现有企业的潜在力量外，国营纺织业在第一个五年计划内尚需根据需要和可能，新建和扩建相当数量的纱锭，以及相应的织布设备和印染设备。在今后的基本建设计划中，必须逐步解决地区分布不平衡的问题，使工厂接近原料产地和内地市场，并保证安全。同时应解决纺、织、染设备之间不平衡的问题。至于毛、麻、丝、针织、人造纤维等方面，应按需要和可能，适当地增加设备，并为将来的发展打下基础。
    第二，为了提高国营纺织产品质量，增加品种、花色，中央人民政府纺织工业部曾先后制订了统一的棉纱、棉布、印染品等质量标准草案，目前正在国营厂重点试行中。在提高纺织产品的质量和增加品种、花样的同时，还应注意到降低产品成本的问题，今后仍须大力加强原棉和其他原料物料的节约，加强定额管理，并从非生产开支等方面厉行节约，以降低产品成本。在纺织工业的企业中，安全生产和劳动保护有很重要的意义，应继续解决车间降温设备和除尘设备，增设安全装置，并注意女工的特殊劳动保护，这些措施，不仅对职工的身体健康和生产情绪有必要，而且对提高生产效率和改进产品质量也有必要。
    第三，根据国家在过渡时期的总任务，在发展生产、保证需要这一要求下，继续加强对私营纺织业的领导并对其进行社会主义的改造工作，仍是纺织工业部门的一项重要任务。为此，应配合有关部门有计划地发展国家资本主义，逐步扩大公私合营范围；对一时还不具备公私合营条件，或规模过小的，应有计划地扩大加工订货范围，以加强国家对其生产、销售方面的领导。
    报告接着提出了一九五四年纺织工业的方针任务。报告先着重说明完成今年国家计划的重要性。今年纺织工业主要产品的生产计划和一九五三年比较：棉纱增长百分之十一点七七，棉布增长百分之十二点六，印染布增长百分之二十三点五三，麻袋增长百分之五点一九，日用毛纺织品增长百分之十五点三，其他纺织品也都有适当的增长。其中，国营纺织工业（未包括地方国营和公私合营）的生产总值比一九五三年增长百分之十二点七；各种主要产品都有增长；成本计划比一九五三年降低百分之一点一；劳动生产率比一九五三年提高百分之三点一；基本建设计划和一九五三年比较：工作量增加百分之一百十一点六六，建筑面积增加百分之一百十七点八七。其中包括限额以上的建设单位有续建国营西北第三棉纺织厂、国营北京第一棉纺织厂、国营石家庄第一棉纺织厂、国营郑州第一棉纺织厂、新疆七一棉纺织厂，新建国营郑州第三棉纺织厂、国营北京第二棉纺织厂、国营石家庄第二棉纺织厂、国营西北第四棉纺织厂等九个。
    报告接着指出：“根据纺织工业第一个五年计划的要求和一九五四年的任务及目前存在问题，一九五四年纺织工业总的方针任务是：以继续加强计划管理贯彻作业计划为中心，围绕这一中心进一步加强技术管理，推广先进经验；有步骤地建立和贯彻厂长负责制和生产区域管理制及其有关的责任制度，进一步改善劳动组织，深入地开展劳动竞赛；大力培养干部；加强财务成本管理，逐步贯彻经济核算制，把企业管理水平提高一步，以达到增加生产，提高质量，厉行节约，降低成本，提高劳动生产率的目的，完成和超额完成一九五四年国家计划。”
    在这个总的方针任务下，报告对一九五四年的工作，作了如下部署：一、在改进企业管理方面：首先继续加强计划管理和推行作业计划。建立企业单位的生产调度工作和充实其必要人员。此外，还应加强原始纪录统计和定额工作。二、加强技术工作的领导。首先，围绕着节约原料，提高品质，减少停台的要求，加强技术组织措施。其次，应有目的有组织地开展合理化建议和推广先进经验，贯彻机器检修及保修制度。再次，在加强各项技术措施的基础上，不断改进品种，提高产品质量，加强新品种的设计和试制工作，扩大利用原料资源。三、今年全国国营纺织企业，应实行厂长负责制和生产区域管理制，以克服目前企业领导多头和无人负责的现象。四、加强基本建设领导：首先是加强设计工作，保证按照预定设计进度完成设计任务，并争取提前交图，以便能尽早开始施工。同时要改善工地管理，提高工程质量。在供应新厂的纺织机器制造方面，主要是集中力量进行印染机器及新型棉纺织机器设计，继续提高质量和降低成本。五、在贯彻中心工作的同时，应加强财务成本的管理，逐步贯彻经济核算制。六、大力培养干部，其办法是：加强学校的领导；用增设副职，和举办较正规的干部学校、技工学校，有计划地采取轮训办法，培养各种技术、业务干部与技术工人，特别是那些目前最缺乏的如印染、棉纺织机械和电气保全工等工种。七、关于国家资本主义，今年应整理和巩固原有公私合营各厂；在各地党委和政府的统一领导下，根据需要和可能和自愿的原则，对若干私营厂进行合营；加强对各行各业和各企业的调查研究，弄清情况，为今后的扩展公私合营工作作好准备。对于目前已处在中、低级形式的国家资本主义企业应加强联系，继续在业务上技术上经营管理上给以更多的帮助。
    报告最后说：为了保证一切工作的顺利进行，应继续在广大职工群众中进行国家在过渡时期总任务的广泛深入的宣传教育工作，不断鼓舞政治热情，提高觉悟，使之成为推动各项工作完成和超额完成任务的政治动力。各级领导干部尤应加强政治学习和业务学习，深刻体会总路线的精神实质，经常以此为尺度来检查工作和总结经验；必须学习苏联社会主义经济建设的理论和先进经验，克服工作上的盲目事务性；必须提倡学会技术，学会管理社会主义的工业，提倡钻研业务，树立学习钻研的风气。纺织工业的全体职工，特别是各级领导干部，应进一步加强团结，开展批评和自我批评，戒骄戒躁，努力克服工作中的缺点，不断提高企业的管理水平和领导水平，为完成和超额完成国家计划而奋斗！　（新华社）
