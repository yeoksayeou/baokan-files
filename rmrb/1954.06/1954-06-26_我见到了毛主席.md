    I Met Chairman Mao
    Member of the Korean People's Delegation to China, Yin Chengyu
    Embraced by Beijing
    Beijing is a place I often yearn for and cherish. This is not only because I lived in Beijing for several years, but also because it is the heart of New China, the source of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and the place where the great leader of the Chinese people and close friend of the Korean people, Chairman Mao Zedong, resides.
    I am honored to be a member of the Korean People's Delegation to China, carrying a burning heart—to convey the Korean people's love and gratitude to the Chinese people and Chairman Mao, to see the face of New China with my own eyes, and to fulfill the wish of meeting Chairman Mao—and arrived at Beijing Zhengyangmen Railway Station on the afternoon of March 14. Amidst the storm of applause and cheers, in the midst of countless people and bouquets, in the deafening shouts of "Kim Il-sung Long Live!" "Mao Zedong Long Live!", and in the solemn national anthems of China and Korea, we gloriously and proudly embraced Beijing!
    Dear Beijing, long-missed Beijing! When I threw myself into your arms, I almost didn't recognize you, because you had rejuvenated and taken on a new look. You are no longer the old, lifeless Beijing, but a vibrant, new Beijing. Every street has changed: the streets that used to be so dusty, blinding in the wind and muddy in the rain, have now become smooth asphalt roads; the beggars who used to beg along the streets and the extravagantly dressed playboys and fashionable ladies who leisurely strolled around have all disappeared. Now the streets are full of simply dressed, energetic working people who are busy building their motherland. Countless high-rise buildings are under construction, and many state-owned department stores and cooperative shops display practical and beautiful daily necessities. Everywhere there are songs of marching towards socialism, and everywhere there is an atmosphere of joy. In your embrace, I feel warm in my heart, and I feel a great force encouraging me to move towards the path of striving for people's democracy and lasting peace.
    Visits and Meetings
    In Beijing, I participated in the symposiums held by our delegation with Chinese scientists and educators. These two symposiums gave me a deep impression: Chinese scientists and educators are striving to implement the Party's general line during the transition period of the country, and to build a socialist motherland, based on Chairman Mao's instructions to connect with reality and connect with the masses.
    I also participated in the symposium held by our delegation and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and listened to Comrade Li Weihan's important speech on the work of the united front. In his speech, he gave a particularly detailed explanation of the issue of incorporating capitalist industry and commerce into the track of state capitalism, which we found very interesting. According to his speech, we can clearly understand that China is carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in accordance with the general task of the transition period of the country. Here I saw another brilliant example of the combination of Marxist-Leninist theory and the practice of the Chinese revolution.
    I happily set off with the delegation to the North Road on March 27. Among the visits, performances, and other activities we carried out in various places along the North Road, what I will never forget is the warm welcome and deep friendship of the people of all ethnic groups in Hohhot, the seat of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Here we can see that under the shining light of the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policy, the people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are already living a free and happy life and are receiving noble internationalist education. What particularly moved me was that on the day we left Hohhot, countless young men and women embraced us so warmly that some people even shed tears of deep affection. This real and noble feeling really moved me too much, and I also shed tears, and in order to always commemorate their great friendship, I wrote the following seven-character poem:
    	The sounds of drums and music welcoming guests shake the city of Hohhot, the snow melts on the Yin Mountains, and the spring air is clear,
    	The Han, Mongolian, Chinese, and Korean people gather here, the sounds of strings, pipes, songs, and dances cheer,
    	Sincere feelings overflow like a tide, hot tears crisscross like pouring rain,
    	I wish under the red sun of the East, a hundred flowers will bloom in the yellow sand north of the desert.
    When we visited the Wangmang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Xi'an, I saw an astonishing thing, that is, the following message was written on the blackboard newspaper: "On the afternoon of February 7, Zhang Lanying, a woman from Xiaoguhe Village, Twelfth Township, Duqu District, Chang'an County, and her daughter-in-law Li Xiuqin went to Shuitou Village to watch a play and picked up two million yuan on the road. They returned the money intact to the township head so that the money could be returned to its owner." When I saw this news, I immediately thought of the farmers' well-fed and well-clothed lives here and their noble moral qualities cultivated under the education of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
    During our visit to China, in Beijing and in visiting Zhangjiakou, Hohhot, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Baoding, Tianjin and other places, we have seen with our own eyes the thriving New China in the process of realizing the general task of the transition period. Countless workers and peasants have expressed to us that they will warmly respond to Chairman Mao's call, and use practical actions of increasing production and practicing economy to support the restoration and construction of the Korean people, and strengthen the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean people; countless young people and students have expressed to us that they will practice Chairman Mao's instructions of "good health, good study, and good work" to further develop the Resist America, Aid Korea movement; countless family members of volunteers have expressed to us that they will write letters to their loved ones and children on the front lines in Korea, and encourage them to be more vigilant, strictly guard against the enemy's unrest, and actively assist the restoration work of the Korean people.
    From the visit, I once again realized how deep the Chinese people's friendship with the Korean people is! How firm is their determination to continue to develop the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue! When they welcomed us, they all said that the righteous struggle of the heroic Korean people against the aggression of American imperialism and its running dog, the Li Seung-man gang, greatly helped China's peaceful construction. At first, I thought this was just polite talk, but later I realized that this was not polite talk, but their basic understanding of mutual assistance and cooperation between the Korean and Chinese peoples. This made me deeply feel how profound internationalist education the great Chinese people have received under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. At the same time, it also made me feel the pride and glory of being a Korean people who have made contributions to defending peace in the Far East and the world under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung.
    On the "May Day" Review Stand
    In order to participate in the "May Day" review, the delegation returned to Beijing on April 28.
    On May 1, before dawn, the entire city of Beijing was boiling, and the cheers and drum music of tens of millions of people celebrating "May Day" resounded through the clouds. Shortly before 10 o'clock in the morning, we squeezed through the crowd and walked onto the review stand—the first stand on the east side. At that time, Tiananmen Square had already become a world of people and flags. Then, amidst the storm of applause and cheers, the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and his close comrades-in-arms Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, and others appeared on the podium above Tiananmen. At this time, the people on the review stand all turned around and looked towards Chairman Mao. However, because the distance was a bit far, no matter how hard I tried to use my eyesight, I couldn't see his face clearly. Many foreign comrades next to me took out binoculars and looked at him. I really wanted to borrow binoculars from them to see, but I hesitated several times, and finally didn't dare to take the liberty because of the language barrier. At this time, the Chinese comrade who was hosting us told me: When the meeting is about to end, Chairman Mao will walk along both sides of the podium, and then you can stand at the highest point behind this stand and see clearly. I was very happy to hear this, and I preemptively occupied a position at the highest point on the stand and waited.
    About four hours later, the solemn and great parade demonstration was about to end. At this time, Chairman Mao slowly walked from the center of the podium to the east side of the gate tower. The closer he got to us, the more the cheers and applause of "Long live Chairman Mao" resounded on the review stand, and I also tried my best to applaud and cheer Long live Chairman Mao. At this time, Chairman Mao also smiled and frequently waved to the people to signal. Finally, he was only a few meters away from us, and I could see his kind and amiable face very clearly. What made me particularly happy at this time was that his complexion was so rosy and his hair was so black, he looked as healthy as a young person. I thought secretly in my heart: Chairman Mao has not aged at all, isn't this still the happiness of the Chinese people and something worth celebrating for the Korean people? At this time, I thought: When I go back to my country and point to the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the wall of my house and tell my wife and children that Chairman Mao is much younger than this portrait, how happy will they be! When I tell all the comrades in our "New Korea News Agency" (Note: The author of this article is the deputy editor of "New Korea News Agency") that Chairman Mao is much younger than the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging in our agency, how happy will they be! No, when I tell all the Korean people I have met that Chairman Mao is in very good health, what kind of encouragement will they get!
    Dear Chairman Mao, great Chairman Mao! Under the leadership of you and our respected leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, our Chinese and Korean peoples have defeated Japanese imperialists and American aggressors. The blood shed by the people of the two countries in the long-term common struggle has cultivated the flower of peaceful friendship between the two brotherly countries. This flower of peaceful friendship has now bloomed all over the banks of the Yalu River and Tumen River flowing on the borders of the two countries, and all over the Daedong River and Cheongcheon River basins, and all over the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins. Let the people of the two countries forever sing the songs of free and happy life in this flower bush of peaceful friendship! Dear Chairman Mao, great Chairman Mao! Under the leadership of you and our respected leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples, cemented with blood, has further strengthened the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and has become a solid fortress for defending the independence and security of Korea and China and peace in the Far East. If any imperialist wants to invade this fortress, it is like a moth flying into the fire and seeking its own destruction. Let the warmongers of Wall Street tremble in front of this powerful fortress!

    我见到了毛主席
    朝鲜人民访华代表团团员　尹澄宇
    投入了北京的怀抱
    北京是我经常向往的地方，也是我经常怀念的地方。这不仅是因为我在北京住过好几年，而是因为它是新中国的心脏，是抗美援朝运动的策源地，是中国人民的伟大领袖、朝鲜人民的亲密朋友毛泽东主席所在的地方。
    我很荣幸地作为朝鲜人民访华代表团的一员，怀着一颗火热的心——要把朝鲜人民热爱和感谢中国人民和毛主席的心传达给中国人民，要亲眼看到新中国的面貌，见到毛主席的心愿——在三月十四日下午到达了北京正阳门车站。在暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声中，在无数的人丛和花束中，在响彻云霄的
  “金日成万岁！”“毛泽东万岁！”口号声中，在庄严的中朝两国国歌声中，我们光荣地、骄傲地投入北京的怀里！
    亲爱的北京，久违的北京！在我投到你的怀里的时候，我几乎不认识你了，因为你已经返老还童，焕然一新了。你再不是古老的死气沉沉的北京，而是朝气勃勃的新的北京了。每一个街道都变了样儿：过去曾是那么多的灰土、一刮风叫人睁不开眼睛和一下雨泥泞不堪的街道，现在已变成了光滑滑的柏油路；过去沿街乞食的叫化子与奇装艳服逍遥兜风的花花公子和摩登小姐已经一个也不见了。现在满街都是衣着朴素、朝气勃勃、为建设祖国而忙碌的劳动人民。无数的高楼大厦在建设中，许多国营百货公司和合作社商店陈列着又实用又漂亮的日用品。到处是向着社会主义前进的歌声，到处是一片欢乐的气象。我在你的怀抱里，心里感到暖烘烘的，感到有一种伟大的力量在鼓舞着我走向争取人民民主，争取持久和平的道路。
    参观和访问
    在北京我曾参加了我们代表团同中国科学工作者和教育工作者举行的座谈会。这两个座谈会，使我得到一个深刻的印象，那就是：中国的科学工作者和教育工作者正在根据毛主席的联系实际、联系群众的指示，为实现党在国家过渡时期的总路线，为建设社会主义的祖国而奋斗。
    我又参加了我们代表团和中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会举行的座谈会，听到了李维汉同志关于统一战线工作的具有重要意义的谈话。他在谈话中，对于把资本主义工商业纳入国家资本主义的轨道的问题，特别作了详尽的说明，使我们感到非常有兴趣。根据他的谈话我们可以清楚地知道，按照国家过渡时期总任务，中国正在对资本主义工商业进行社会主义的改造。这里我又看到了关于马克思列宁主义理论和中国革命实践相结合的光辉的范例。
    我怀着一种愉快的心情于三月二十七日随代表团向北路出发。我们在北路各处进行访问演出等工作中，使我最难忘的是，内蒙古自治区人民政府所在地呼和浩特市各族各界人民对我们的那种热烈的欢迎和深厚的友谊。在这里我们可以知道在中国共产党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，内蒙古自治区人民已经过着自由幸福的生活，并受到高尚的国际主义教育。特别使我感动的，就是我们离开呼和浩特的那天，无数的青年男女那样热烈地拥抱着我们，甚至有的人因惜别情深而热泪滂沱。这种真实而高贵的情感实在使我太感动了，我也流了眼泪，并为了永远纪念他们伟大的友谊，做了下面这一首七言律诗：
      迎宾鼓乐震呼城，雪化阴山春气晴，
      汉蒙中朝汇集处，管弦歌舞欢呼声，
      衷情洋溢如潮涌，热泪交横似雨倾，
        愿祝东方红日下，黄沙漠北百花明。
    我们在访问西安近郊王莽村农业生产合作社的时候，我曾看到一个惊人的事情，那就是在壁报上写着如下的消息：“二月七日下午，长安县杜曲区十二乡小谷河村妇女张兰英和她的儿媳妇李秀琴去水头村看戏，在路上拾得二百万元，她们把钱原封交给乡长，使这笔钱能归还原主。”我看到这个消息，立刻联想到这里农民丰衣足食的生活情形与他们在中国共产党和毛主席的教育下培养起来的高尚的道德品质。
    我们访华代表团在北京以及在访问张家口、呼和浩特、太原、西安、兰州、保定、天津等地中，亲眼看到了在实现过渡时期总任务中欣欣向荣的新中国的面貌。无数的工人和农民都向我们表示：要热烈响应毛主席的号召，用增产节约的实际行动来支援朝鲜人民的恢复建设，并加强中朝两国人民的友谊团结；无数的青年和学生都向我们表示：要实践毛主席的“身体好，学习好，工作好”的指示来深入开展抗美援朝运动；无数的志愿军家属都向我们表示：要写信给在朝鲜前线的爱人和儿女，鼓舞他们更加提高警惕，严防敌人的蠢动并积极援助朝鲜人民的恢复工作。
    从访问中，使我再一次地体会到中国人民对我们朝鲜人民的友谊多么深厚！他们为和平解决朝鲜问题而继续深入开展抗美援朝运动的决心是多么坚强！他们在欢迎我们的时候，都说英雄的朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义侵略及其走狗李承晚匪帮的正义斗争，大大地帮助了中国的和平建设。我起头以为这是说客气话，但后来我才晓得这并不是说客气话，而是他们对朝中两国人民互助合作的基本认识。这使我深深感到伟大的中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下受到多么深刻的国际主义教育。同时也使我感到作为一个在朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅领导下，对保卫远东和世界和平作出贡献的朝鲜人民的骄傲和光荣。
    在“五一”节观礼台上
    访华代表团为了参加“五一”节观礼，于四月二十八日返回北京。
    五月一日，天还没有亮，整个的北京城就沸腾起来了，庆祝“五一”节的千万人的欢呼声和鼓乐声响彻了云霄。快到上午十点钟的时候，我们从人丛中挤过去走上观礼台——东台第一台。那时天安门广场，早已成了一片人山旗海的世界。接着在暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声中，中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席和他的亲密战友刘少奇、朱德等出现在天安门上的主席台上。这时观礼台上的人都一齐转身向毛主席望去。但是，因为距离有点远了，我怎样用尽我的视力也看不清楚他的面容。在我旁边的许多外国同志拿起望远镜望着他，我很想向他们借望远镜来看，但是我踌躇了好几次，终因言语不通，不敢冒昧。这时，招待我们的中国同志告诉我：大会快要结束时，毛主席要在主席台东西两旁走一道，那时你站在这个台上后面最高处可以看得清楚。我听到这个话心里很高兴，预先在台上最高处占了一个地位等着。
    大约过了四个钟头之后，庄严而伟大的游行示威快结束了。这时，果然毛主席从主席台正中慢慢地走向门楼的东边。他愈走离我们愈近了，观礼台上响起了“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声和掌声，我也尽量地鼓掌并欢呼毛主席万岁。这时毛主席也含笑频频向着人们招手示意。最后他离我们不过几公尺了，他那慈祥而和蔼的面容我已看得很清楚。这时使我特别高兴的是，他的脸色那么红润，头发那么乌黑，真像年青的人一样健康。我心里暗暗地想：毛主席一点没有老，这还不是中国人民的幸福和值得朝鲜人民庆贺的事情么？这时我想：在我回国去向我爱人和孩子们指着我屋里墙壁上挂着的毛主席像说，毛主席比这像片还年青得多的时候，她们将怎样地高兴啊！我又向我们“新朝鲜社”（按：本文作者系“新朝鲜社”副主笔）一切工作同志告诉毛主席比我们社里挂着的毛主席像还年青得多的时候，他们又将是怎样高兴啊！不，在我向我见到的所有朝鲜人民告诉毛主席身体很健康的时候，他们又将得到怎样的鼓舞啊！
    亲爱的毛主席，伟大的毛主席！在您和我们敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的领导下，我们中朝两国人民已经战胜了日本帝国主义者和美国侵略者。两国人民在长期的共同斗争中所流的鲜血，培养出了两个兄弟之邦的和平友谊之花，这个和平友谊之花现在已开遍了流在两国国境上的鸭绿江和图们江两岸，开遍了大同江、清川江流域，开遍了黄河、长江流域，让两国人民在这和平友谊的花丛中，永远歌颂自由幸福的生活罢！亲爱的毛主席，伟大的毛主席！在您和我们敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的领导下，中朝两国人民以鲜血凝结成的友谊团结，进一步加强了以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，并成为保卫朝中两国的独立安全和远东和平的巩固的堡垒，任何帝国主义要侵犯这个堡垒，那就像灯蛾扑火一样自找灭亡，让华尔街的战争贩子们在这强大的堡垒面前发抖罢！
