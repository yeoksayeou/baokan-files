    Bumper Harvest in Coastal Fishing Area of Xiaohaishi
    The spring fishing season for Xiaohaishi in coastal areas across the country has basically ended, with fish catches generally higher than in the same period last year.
    The spring fishing season in coastal areas focuses on catching small yellow croaker, prawns, hairy shrimp, and miscellaneous fish. Although there were many windy and foggy days in the East China coastal area during the fishing season, fishermen overcame the difficulties and achieved a bumper harvest by mastering the experience of going out to sea early and fishing diligently, and by implementing various fishing gear operations. Jiangsu Province produced a total of more than 650,000 dan of fish, exceeding the production plan by 18 percent, and increasing production by 54 percent compared with the same period last year. Fujian Province also increased production by about 30 percent compared with the same period last year. Most other regions also achieved bumper harvests. The Liaoxi fishing grounds completed more than 250 percent of the planned output. The masses in Tanggu District, Tianjin, caught more than four times as many fish and shrimp as in the same period last year. Guangdong Province caught a total of about 1.2 million dan of fish. The total output of fish and shrimp in Xiaohaishi in coastal areas across the country was more than 410,000 tons, accounting for about 30 percent of the total planned output for the year. Calculated at 2,000 yuan per jin, the total output value is about 1,600 billion yuan.
    The production of state-owned aquatic product enterprises has also greatly improved this year. According to statistics from six major aquatic product companies in Shanghai, Qingdao, Luda, Liaodong, Yantai, and Tianjin, the output of fish and shrimp in the first quarter reached more than 20,000 tons, an increase of 41 percent over the same period last year. All enterprises have fulfilled their state tasks of delivering profits. According to statistics from only four aquatic product companies in Shanghai and other places, and two other aquatic product business units, 38.8 billion yuan was delivered in the first quarter.
    At present, various coastal areas have summarized the Xiaohaishi experience, re-adjusted their organizations, and strengthened their leadership, entering the stage of Dahaihi production.

    沿海渔区小海市丰收
    全国沿海春季渔汛小海市生产已基本结束，渔获量较去年同期普遍提高。
    沿海春汛小海市以捕小黄鱼、对虾、毛虾、杂鱼等为主。华东沿海汛期中虽然风多雾大，但因渔民掌握了早出海、勤打鱼的增产经验，并实行多种渔具作业，终于克服了困难，获得丰收。江苏省产鱼共六十五万余担，超过生产计划百分之十八，比去年同期增产百分之五十四。福建省也比去年同期增产百分之三十左右。其他各地也大部获得丰产，辽西各渔场完成计划产量的百分之二百五十多，天津塘沽区群众所捕鱼虾超过去年同期四倍以上，广东省共捕鱼一百二十万担左右。全国沿海小海市共产鱼虾四十一万余吨，约占全年计划总产量的百分之三十，以每斤二千元计算，总产值约达一万六千多亿元。
    国营水产企业的生产，今年也有很大提高，据上海、青岛、旅大、辽东、烟台、天津六个主要水产公司统计，第一季度鱼虾产量达二万余吨，较去年同期增产百分之四十一。各企业单位上缴利润都完成了国家任务，仅上海等四个水产公司及其他两个水产业务单位的统计，第一季度即上缴三百八十八亿元。
    目前，沿海各地已总结了小海市经验，重新调整了组织，加强了领导力量，进入大海市生产阶段。
