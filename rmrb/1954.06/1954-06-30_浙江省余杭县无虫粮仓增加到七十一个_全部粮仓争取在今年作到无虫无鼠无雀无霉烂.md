    Yuhang County, Zhejiang Province Increases the Number of Insect-Free Granaries to Seventy-One
    Strive to Make All Granaries Insect-Free, Rat-Free, Sparrow-Free, and Mold-Free This Year
    Grain storage personnel in Yuhang County, Zhejiang Province, are determined to further improve grain storage work on the basis of creating a large number of insect-free granaries. Recently, they put forward the goal of striving to make all granaries insect-free, rat-free, sparrow-free, and mold-free this year.
    In the past, the grain depots under the Yuhang County People's Government Grain Bureau only paid attention to cleaning and hygiene for insect control, and relatively relaxed the prevention and control of rat and sparrow damage. During the county's 1953 annual summary, evaluation, and award ceremony for grain storage work held in March this year, the shortcomings were pointed out. Since then, the grain storage personnel of each grain depot, in conjunction with the general grain stocktaking and sun-drying of grain, have carried out in-depth cleaning and hygiene work in the warehouses, and at the same time, launched rat-catching and sparrow-prevention campaigns. Grain depots throughout the county thoroughly cleaned inside and outside the warehouses, removing insect cocoons, insect corpses, dust, garbage, and other dirt. At the same time, they actively repaired sparrow nets and added rat traps, using stones and lime mortar to block rat holes and sparrow nests. Grain storage personnel at the Cangqian District Grain Depot caught 369 rats in 34 days from mid-March to mid-April. At present, the number of insect-free granaries in the county has increased from 55 last year to 71, and sparrow damage in all 87 granaries in the county has been completely eliminated.

    浙江省余杭县无虫粮仓增加到七十一个
    全部粮仓争取在今年作到无虫无鼠无雀无霉烂
    浙江省余杭县粮食保管人员决心在创造大批无虫粮仓的基础上，把粮食保管工作再提高一步，最近他们提出了争取全部粮仓在今年作到无虫、无鼠、无雀、无霉烂的奋斗目标。
    余杭县人民政府粮食局所属各粮库过去只注重清洁卫生防治虫害的工作，对鼠害、雀害的防治比较放松。今年三月间，该县粮食局召开的一九五三年度全县保管粮食工作总结评比授奖大会上指出了这一缺点。此后，各粮库粮食保管人员结合存粮普查和翻晒粮食，深入开展了仓库清洁卫生工作，同时掀起了捕鼠、防雀运动。全县各粮库在仓房内外进行了彻底的打扫，清除了虫茧、虫尸和灰尘、垃圾等污物，同时积极修整防雀网，添置捕鼠器，用石块、泥灰堵塞鼠穴和雀洞。仓前区粮库的粮食保管人员在三月中旬到四月中旬的三十四天内，就捕鼠三百六十九只。现在，该县的无虫粮仓已由去年的五十五个增加到七十一个，全县八十七个粮仓的雀害已经全部消除。（陶铭盘）
