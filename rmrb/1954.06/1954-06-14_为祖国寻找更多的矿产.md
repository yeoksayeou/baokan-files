    The forty-three prospecting teams of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government have begun to depart, and China's unprecedented large-scale mineral prospecting work is about to begin. The tasks of these prospecting teams are to find new iron ore deposits, conduct coalfield prospecting, expand manganese ore prospecting, and search for various metal minerals throughout the country. This large-scale mineral prospecting work has opened a glorious new page in the history of China's geological work. Successfully completing this task, finding new exploration bases, and exploring more mineral resources will not only meet the needs of the country's current construction, but also provide the necessary prerequisites for the second Five-Year Plan and longer-term construction plans, and pave the way for changing the historical face of China's economic geography. Therefore, this is a very important task in China's economic life.
    Mineral resources are one of the most important material foundations for national industrialization. Without exploring enough underground minerals, it is impossible to build a modern industry. Geological work for exploring mineral resources is one of the most important tasks in national construction, the basis for planning and design, and the first step in national construction, which must be carried out as early as possible. It takes several years to build a steel plant with an annual output of one million tons or a shaft with an annual output of 900,000 tons of coal, and it also takes several years to complete the entire exploration work of a mineral deposit of this scale. Therefore, the iron and steel industry and mining industry that will be put into production in the second Five-Year Plan and even the third Five-Year Plan must start resource exploration now. Carrying out large-scale prospecting from this year is undoubtedly a timely measure to further change the backward state of China's geological work and catch up with the needs of the country's current and long-term construction.
    According to China's geological conditions and incomplete historical records, China is a country rich in various mineral resources. The reactionary rulers of old China did not care about national construction at all, did not exploit the country's underground resources, and even fabricated the fallacy that China's resources were poor. The achievements of China's geologists in the past four years have initially proved that China has huge iron ore deposits that are rare in the world, and based on Soviet geological theories, it has proved that the distribution of oil fields in China is widespread, shattering absurd remarks such as "China is an anemic country in terms of oil." The mass reporting of mineral deposits in recent years has provided thousands of new clues, further proving that our country has abundant mineral deposits. However, this does not mean that all difficulties have disappeared. On the one hand, many minerals still have only rough data and have not been prospected and explored. On the other hand, some known mineral areas cannot adapt to the regional distribution plan of industrial construction. Therefore, it is necessary to find more minerals to meet the needs of national construction.
    The most important task in prospecting work is to continue to find more major minerals such as iron, coal, and copper, which are the most important material basis for national construction. At present, some of these major minerals cannot meet the needs of the country's current construction; some, although they meet the needs of the current construction, should still be prepared for long-term needs. We know that modern industries are large-scale and require a long depreciation period to make construction economical and reasonable. Therefore, it is necessary to have mineral resources that are adapted to the depreciation period of the enterprise. For example, a steel plant with an annual output of one million tons needs to maintain production for decades to be economical and reasonable. If the mineral resources of this steel plant cannot meet the production needs for decades and are mined out in three to five years, it will be the biggest waste in construction. Therefore, taking iron ore as an example, according to incomplete statistics in the past, although there are more than 200 iron ore deposits that have been mined in China's history, and mass reporting of mineral deposits in recent years has provided many new iron ore clues, not all of these mineral deposits can meet the requirements of modern steel enterprises and meet the needs of national construction. This requires geologists to grasp this information, select the most valuable areas for prospecting, and then select the most valuable areas from the results of the prospecting to organize exploration and meet the needs of national construction.
    Secondly, it is necessary to expand the scope of exploration of mineral types. Modern science has discovered hundreds of useful underground minerals, and the metal materials needed in modern industry are often a combination of several and many elements. If the supply of various mineral raw materials cannot maintain a balance according to a certain proportion, it will make industrial construction crooked. In the past few years, China's geological work has been limited to the exploration of only a few major mineral types, so the shortage of certain mineral types has become very significant. If we cannot find new mineral types needed by the country, our metallurgical industry can only stay at the primary level, can only smelt general metal materials, and many special materials needed by China's machinery industry and national defense industry cannot be supplied from domestic sources, and the independence of our national economy cannot be guaranteed.
    Third, it is necessary to meet the country's requirements in terms of the regional distribution of minerals. The regional distribution of minerals that have been explored in China is unbalanced and unreasonable. Some minerals are enough from a national perspective, but insufficient from the perspective of some regions. In particular, most of China's existing industries are distributed along the coast, which is not only close to the national defense front line, but also far away from raw material, fuel production areas, and consumption areas. This deformed and unbalanced industrial distribution reflects the colonial and semi-colonial form of industry in old China. China's socialist industrialization must, according to Lenin and Stalin's theory of socialist productive forces distribution, change the historical face of economic geography, rationalize the distribution of industry, accelerate the speed of socialist expanded reproduction, and promote the unity of all ethnic groups and the consolidation of the state power. The geological work department must, according to the requirements of rational industrial distribution, carry out mineral prospecting in new areas that do not yet have or have very little industry, and find economically valuable mineral deposits in these areas.
    From this, it can be seen that the task of mineral prospecting is very arduous, and prospecting work is still a new task for us. Although China's geologists have also carried out some prospecting work in the past, they were not very clear about the nature and methods of prospecting, especially lacking understanding of the long-term and comprehensive nature of prospecting work, often just taking a cursory look. Due to the lack of long-term and comprehensive work in a certain area, it is difficult to obtain a comprehensive and true evaluation, which greatly weakens the effect of prospecting. In order to complete this year's prospecting work well, we must strive to overcome past shortcomings, and learning the theory and specific experience of Soviet prospecting work is an important method to help us quickly overcome shortcomings. All comrades of the prospecting teams must earnestly study these theories and experiences, improve their skills, and find more minerals for the motherland.
    This year's prospecting work is being carried out jointly by the staff of the geological department and the teachers and students of the geology department of geological colleges and universities. This is the beginning of cooperation between the production department and the education department. The geological department can use the strength of the schools to accelerate the completion of production tasks. The schools can complete the production practice in the teaching plan while completing the prospecting tasks, and can also use some areas where prospecting has been carried out for a long time as bases for future production practice and scientific research. Therefore, both parties must cooperate closely and strengthen unity. The production department should prevent the purely utilitarian viewpoint, and the schools should also prevent the tendency to only focus on learning and disregard production tasks. In particular, the cadres, technical personnel of the geological department and the teachers of the school should abide by the principle of collective leadership, respect each other, learn from each other, unite closely, and establish a strong leadership of the grassroots organization of prospecting work. For the large number of young students participating in this prospecting work, each prospecting team should patiently cultivate their ability to work independently, and then gradually increase their workload, and provide concrete help in the work continuously. Young students should learn with an open mind, work diligently, and constantly exercise and improve themselves.
    This year's prospecting work is huge, the area is vast, and there are many difficulties in work and life. Each prospecting team must strive for the leadership and support of the local Party committees and governments, maintain close ties with the masses, and strictly abide by mass discipline. In areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, we should implement ethnic policies and respect the customs and habits of ethnic minorities. Each prospecting team should further mobilize the masses to report mineral deposits in order to quickly obtain information and gain the support of the masses for the development of prospecting work. Local Party committees and governments should care about the work of the prospecting teams and give strong support in terms of transportation, medicine, and culture. The people of all regions should report the minerals they know to the prospecting teams, lead the way for the prospecting teams, and support the work of the prospecting teams.
    The day of departure of the prospecting teams has arrived. I wish all comrades of the prospecting teams a victorious completion of the glorious task of the motherland.

    为祖国寻找更多的矿产
    中央人民政府地质部四十三个普查工作队已开始出发，我国空前规模的矿产普查工作即将开始。这些普查工作队的任务是寻找新的铁矿产地，进行煤田普查，扩大锰矿普查，并在全国范围内寻找各种金属矿产。这次大规模的矿产普查工作，打开了我国地质工作新历史的光辉一页。胜利地完成这个任务，找寻到新的勘探基地，探明更多的矿产资源，不仅可以满足国家当前建设的需要，也将为第二个五年计划和更长远的建设计划提供必要的先决条件，为改变我国经济地理的历史面貌开辟道路。因此，这是我国经济生活中的一项甚为重要的工作。
    矿产资源是国家工业化最重要的物质基础之一。没有探明足够的地下矿产，就不能建设近代的工业。勘探矿产资源的地质工作是国家建设中最重要的工作之一，是计划和设计的基础，是国家建设的先行步骤，必须及早进行。要建设一个年产一百万吨的钢铁厂或是一个年产九十万吨煤的竖井都需要几年时间，而完成这样规模的矿产地的全部勘探工作，也需要几年时间。因而在第二个五年计划乃至第三个五年计划投入生产的钢铁工业和采掘工业，必须从现在起就着手资源勘探工作。从今年起开展大规模的普查，无疑地，是进一步改变我国地质工作的落后状态，赶上国家当前和长远建设需要的适时的措施。
    根据我国的地质条件和历史上的不完全的记载，我国是各种矿产蕴藏丰富的国家。旧中国的反动统治者根本不关心国家的建设，不去发掘国家的地下资源，还捏造我国资源贫乏的谰言。四年来，我国地质工作者初步工作的成就，已经证明我国具有世界上少见的巨大的铁矿，根据苏联的地质理论，证明了中国油田的分布是广泛的，粉碎了“中国是石油贫血的国家”等荒谬言论。近年来的群众报矿又提供了数千处新的线索，更证明我们的国家埋藏着丰富的矿产。但是，这并不是说一切困难都没有了。一方面，由于很多矿产还只有粗略的资料，并没有进行普查和勘探，另一方面，某些已知的矿产区，又还不能和工业建设地域分布计划相适应。因此必须寻找更多的矿产，满足国家建设的需要。
    普查工作中最重要的任务，就是必须继续寻找更多的铁、煤、铜等主要矿产，这些矿产是国家建设中最重要的物质基础。目前，这些主要矿产有些还不能满足国家当前建设的需要；有些虽然满足了当前建设的需要，但还应该为远景需要作准备。我们知道，近代工业都是规模巨大的，需要较长的折旧年限，才能使建设经济、合理，因而就需要有与企业折旧年限相适应的矿产资源。例如一个年产一百万吨的钢铁厂，需要维持数十年的生产，它的建设才是经济的、合理的。如果这个钢铁厂的矿产资源不能满足数十年的生产需要，三年五年就采完了，那就是建设中最大的浪费。因此，以铁矿来说，据过去不完全的统计，我国历史上已开采的铁矿产地虽有二百余处，近年来的群众报矿又提供了很多新的铁矿线索，但这些矿产地并不都能适应近代钢铁企业的要求，都能满足国家建设的需要，这就需要地质工作者掌握这些资料，选择最有价值的地区进行普查，再从普查的结果中选择最有价值的地区，组织勘探，满足国家建设的需要。
    其次，就是要扩大矿产种类的勘探范围。近代科学所发现的地下有用矿产数以百计，现代工业中需要的金属材料，往往也是数种和很多种原素的综合，各种矿物原料的供应如果不能按照一定比例保持平衡，就会使工业建设歪手歪脚。过去几年来，我国的地质工作还只局限于几种主要矿种的勘探，因而某些矿种的不足已十分显著。如果我们不能找到国家需要的新的矿种，我们的冶金工业就只能停留在初级的水平上，只能冶炼一般的金属材料，我国机械工业和国防工业所需要的很多特殊材料就不能从国内得到供应，我们国家经济的独立也就不能得到保证。
    第三，必须在矿产的地区分布上满足国家的要求。我国已探明的矿产的地区分布是不平衡、不合理的。有些矿产从全国范围来看是够了，但从某些地区来看是不足的。特别是我国现有工业大都分布在沿海一带，不仅临近国防前线，而且远离原料、燃料产地和消费地区，这种畸形的、不平衡的工业分布，反映了旧中国工业的殖民地和半殖民地形态；我国的社会主义工业化必须根据列宁和斯大林的社会主义生产力分布的学说，改变经济地理的历史面貌，使工业的分布趋于合理，以加速社会主义扩大再生产的速度，促进各民族的团结和国家政权的巩固。地质工作部门就必须根据工业合理分布的要求，在新的、现在还没有或很少有工业的地区开展矿产普查，在这些地区找出有经济价值的矿产地。
    由此可见，矿产普查工作的任务是十分繁重的，而普查工作对我们说来又还是一个新的工作。我国地质工作者过去虽然也进行过一些普查工作，但对普查的性质和作法是不太明确的，特别是对普查工作的长期性和综合性缺乏认识，常常是走马看花，一望而过。由于在一定的区域内缺乏长期的和综合的工作，就很难得出全面的、真实的评价，大大削弱了普查的效果。为了很好地完成今年普查工作的任务，就必须努力克服过去的缺点，而学习苏联普查工作的理论和具体经验，则是帮助我们迅速克服缺点的重要方法。全体普查工作队的同志们必须认真学习这些理论和经验，提高自己的本领，为祖国找到更多的矿产。
    今年的普查工作是由地质部门工作人员和地质学院及各大学地质系的师生共同进行的。这是生产部门与教育部门合作的开端，地质部门可以借助学校的力量，加速生产任务的完成，学校方面可以在完成普查任务中同时完成教学计划中的生产实习，并且可以把若干长期进行普查的地区，作为今后生产实习和科学研究的基地。因此，双方必须亲密合作，加强团结。生产部门要防止单纯使用观点，学校方面也要防止只管学习不顾生产任务的偏向。特别是地质部门的干部、技术人员与学校的教师更应遵守集体领导原则，互相尊重、互相学习，紧密团结，建立起普查工作基层组织的强有力的领导。对参加此次普查工作的大量青年学生，各个普查工作队应耐心培养他们独立工作的能力，然后再逐步地加大其工作量，并在工作中不间断地给予具体帮助。青年学生们则应虚心学习，踏实工作，不断地锻炼和提高自己。
    今年普查工作的任务巨大，地区辽阔，工作上和生活上的困难是很多的。各个普查工作队必须争取当地党委和政府的领导与支持，密切联系群众，严守群众纪律。在少数民族居住地区更应执行民族政策，尊重少数民族的风俗习惯。各个普查工作队并应进一步发动群众报矿，以迅速获得情报，使普查工作的展开得到群众的支持。各地党委和政府应关怀普查工作队的工作，在交通、医药、文化等物质条件上给以大力支援。各地人民群众应该把自己所知道的矿产报告给普查工作队，替普查工作队带路，支持普查工作队的工作。
    普查工作队出发的日子已经来到了。祝全体普查工作队的同志们胜利完成祖国的光荣任务。
