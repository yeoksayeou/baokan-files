    What is Happiness
    Song Qingling

    The "June 1st" International Children's Day is here again. I am filled with joy as I congratulate the children on happily celebrating their holiday, and I also share in their joy.

    Everyone has their own childhood and adolescence, but no one has ever felt as happy as the children of today; our motherland has never been so proud of its children as it is today. Whenever I see the Young Pioneers marching past in the parade in front of Tiananmen Square, my heart is stirred. When I see those red scarves, those flowers, those round, excited smiling faces, and hear the children shouting "Long live Chairman Mao" in clear and bright voices, I think of the infinitely beautiful future of our motherland.

    Children growing up in the Mao Zedong era are happy. Because your memories began with the founding of the People's Republic of China; because the great Chairman Mao cares for you like a father; because the Communist Party, the Communist Youth League, and many pioneers have set shining examples for you; because you are growing up in a period when the motherland has begun large-scale socialist construction; because you will soon participate in the construction of the motherland, and personally build a brand new socialist and communist society on our ancient land.

    Our ancestors throughout the ages have labored and fought on this glorious land. Generation after generation, they fought against nature, and against invaders and oppressors. They shed sweat and blood for the motherland, they sang, and they also shed many tears. Among them, many are worthy of our long-term memory. For many years, they have been working and fighting diligently and bravely, all for the same hope: that the next generation can live a peaceful and happy life, no longer be oppressed, no longer suffer, and be able to build the motherland into a beautiful and powerful country. But this hope only became a reality in the Mao Zedong era. Only the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao led the Chinese people to overthrow the reactionaries, drive away the imperialists, enable the Chinese people to stand up, and begin socialist construction to build our motherland into a great socialist country. The scale of such construction is very large, and such a task is also very arduous. But the people of the whole country are throwing themselves into this glorious task with the greatest enthusiasm, using the labor of hundreds of millions of people to create a socialist society. The purpose is to build the motherland into a peaceful and happy paradise, to make generations of children live better, and to cultivate and educate them to become more educated, healthier, more courageous people who can complete any arduous task. In this way, you are growing up in an unprecedentedly great historical period, and will soon join the ranks of building and defending the motherland, continuing to uphold the banner of socialism and communism, and march towards the final victory. Therefore, I say you are happy.

    I say you are happy, precisely because infinitely broad roads are unfolding before you. Every road is glorious, and every road requires the use of labor and wisdom to traverse. In our vast land, people are needed everywhere to labor and create: the doors of underground mineral deposits need us to open them; the secrets of the primeval forests need us to reveal them; the waters of the Yangtze River flow day and night without stopping, and we need to utilize them; on the edges of the coast and the desert, we need to create windbreaks; the vast farmlands need us to carry out production with new technologies and new organizations; many places that now look desolate need us to build factories, and even build new cities; the vast borders and oceans need us to defend them. Every task is glorious, but no matter which path you prepare to take, the most important thing is to prepare yourself first. You cannot start your journey empty-handed. You must arm yourself with knowledge, and you must develop a strong body and enough courage. Nature, machines, and all work treat those without knowledge, those who are timid, very unkindly, even often rudely and cruelly; but they treat those with rich knowledge, those who are strong and brave, very obediently, acknowledging you as the master, willing to serve you.

    Therefore, as you are preparing to participate in this great labor, as you are preparing to undertake the glorious task of building and defending the motherland, as you are preparing to realize Chairman Mao's great ideals, first of all, remember what Chairman Mao told you, and achieve "good health, good study, and good work."

    Learning and training yourselves to become knowledgeable, strong, and brave people, preparing to participate in labor, and maintaining the honor of the motherland, this is your happiness, this is what you should think about first when celebrating the "June 1st" International Children's Day.

    什么是幸福
    宋庆龄
    “六一”国际儿童节又到了，我怀着满心的喜悦，祝贺孩子们欢乐地度过自己的节日，并且我也分享了孩子们的欢乐。
    每个人都有自己的童年和少年时期，但是从来没有人像今天的孩子们这样感到如此的幸福；我们的祖国也从来没有像今天这样为了自己的孩子们感到如此的骄傲。每当我在天安门前的游行队伍中看到少年先锋队员的队伍走过来的时候，我的心就激动起来。我看到那些红领巾，看到那些鲜花，看到那些圆润的兴奋的笑脸，听到孩子们用清脆嘹亮的声音喊着“毛主席万岁”，就使我想到我们祖国无限美好的未来。
    生长在毛泽东时代的孩子们是幸福的。因为你们的记忆是和中华人民共和国的成立一道开始的；因为伟大的毛主席像父亲一样地关怀着你们；因为共产党、青年团和许多先锋人物为你们树立了光辉的榜样；因为你们正生长在祖国开始了大规模社会主义建设的时期；因为你们很快地将要参加祖国的建设事业，在我们的古老的土地上亲手建设起一个崭新的社会主义和共产主义社会。
    我们历代的祖先们曾在我们这块光荣的土地上劳动过、战斗过，他们一代一代地和自然界作战，和侵略者、压迫者作战。他们曾经为着祖国流过汗，流过血，歌唱过，也流过很多眼泪，在他们中间有很多人是值得我们长久记忆的。多少年来，他们勤劳勇敢地劳动着和战斗着，都是为了同一个希望：就是希望下一代的人们能够过着和平幸福的生活，不再受压迫，不再受苦，并且能把祖国建设得又美丽、又强大。可是这个希望只有到了毛泽东时代才变成了现实。只有中国共产党和毛主席才领导着中国人民打倒了反动派，赶走了帝国主义，使中国人民站立起来，开始进行社会主义建设，要把我们的祖国建设成一个伟大的社会主义国家。这样一个建设的规模是非常大的，而这样一个任务也是非常艰巨的。可是全国人民正以最大的热情投入这样一个光荣的任务中，用亿万人的劳动来创造社会主义社会。目的就是为了要把祖国建设成一个和平幸福的乐园，要使一代一代的孩子们生活得更美好，并且要把他们培养教育成为更有教养、更健壮、更勇敢、能够完成任何艰巨任务的人。这样看来，你们正是生长在一个空前伟大的历史时期，并且不久就要加入到建设祖国和保卫祖国的队伍中来，继续撑持着社会主义和共产主义的旗帜，走到最终的胜利。因此，我说你们是幸福的。
    我说你们是幸福的，正因为在你们的面前展现着无限广阔的道路。每一条路都是光荣的，每一条路都需要运用劳动和智慧才能走得通。在我们广大的土地上，到处都需要人们去劳动，去创造：地下矿藏的大门需要我们去把它打开；原始森林的秘密需要我们去揭露；长江大河的水昼夜不停地流掉了，需要我们去利用；海岸和沙漠的边沿上需要我们去营造防风林带；广大的农田需要我们用新的技术和新的组织去进行生产；许多现在看起来还很荒凉的地方，需要我们去建设工厂，甚至建设新的城市；辽阔的边疆和海洋需要我们去保卫。每个任务都是光荣的，可是不管你预备走那一条路，顶顶要紧的是先要为自己做好准备。你不能赤手空拳地开始你的行程，你必需用知识把自己武装起来，你必需锻炼出健壮的身体和足够的勇气。自然界、机器和一切工作，对待没有知识的人，对待怯弱的人是很不客气的，甚至常常是粗暴的和残酷的；但是它们对待具有丰富知识的人，对待健壮的和勇敢的人，则是非常驯顺的，承认你是主人，情愿为你服务。
    因此，当你们正在准备参加这个伟大的劳动的时候，当你们正在准备担当起建设祖国、保卫祖国的光荣任务的时候，当你们正在准备实现毛主席的伟大理想的时候，首先就要记住毛主席嘱咐你们的话，做到“身体好，学习好，工作好”。
    学习和锻炼自己成为一个有知识的、健壮的和勇敢的人，准备参加劳动，保持祖国的荣誉，这就是你们的幸福，这就是在庆祝“六一”国际儿童节时首先要想到的事情。　（新华社）
