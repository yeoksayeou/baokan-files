The Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government convened the National Conference on Secondary Specialized Education Administration, which opened in Beijing on the 7th. This conference will focus on discussing the leadership relations and teaching reforms of secondary specialized schools (including secondary technical schools) nationwide, and determine the direction and tasks of secondary specialized education in the future.

The conference began with a report by Zeng Zhaolun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, summarizing the rectification and reform of secondary specialized education and outlining the basic tasks for future work. In his report, Zeng Zhaolun pointed out: In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and adapting to the recovery and development of the national economy, China's secondary specialized education has developed rapidly, cultivating a considerable number of graduates from secondary specialized schools for the country. They have played a certain role on the national economic construction front and in various work posts. However, this development lacked a unified plan in the early days of liberation, which did not guarantee the training of professional cadres according to the needs of the country, and many graduates were unable to cope with practical work. The affiliation of these schools was also unclear, making it difficult to run the schools well. In order to fundamentally change this situation, in accordance with the instructions of the Government Administration Council, the old secondary specialized education began to be rectified and reformed in 1952. By September 1953, the number of secondary specialized schools nationwide had been adjusted from the original 794 to 651. During the adjustment and rectification process, many business departments overcame various difficulties, allocated cadres and teachers to the schools, and made great efforts in building and expanding school buildings and enriching teaching equipment. The academic system of secondary specialized schools was also rectified in 1953. At the same time as the rectification, according to Soviet experience, various industrial departments and other departments set up majors in their affiliated secondary specialized schools; they formulated teaching plans for most of the secondary specialized schools that had already set up majors, and began teaching reforms. In terms of teaching reform, most schools actively implemented them. They studied new teaching plans, teaching syllabuses, and relevant documents on teaching reform, clarified the training goals of professional education, established and improved teaching organizations and teaching systems, improved teaching methods, strengthened the ideological nature of teaching, and thus improved the quality of teaching.

Zeng Zhaolun also pointed out that in this adjustment and rectification, the leadership relations of secondary specialized schools have not been completely resolved, and the phenomenon of multi-level leadership still exists, which needs to be resolved urgently. There are still many shortcomings in the teaching reform work: First, the significance of steady progress and integration with reality was not correctly understood, difficulties were emphasized, and progress was insufficient. Second, the overall understanding of reforming teaching content, teaching organization, teaching system, and teaching methods is not clear. Third, the important significance of learning from Soviet experience is still not fully understood, and some have not learned from Soviet experience well, grasped its spirit and essence, and applied it conscientiously. He also emphasized that these shortcomings and problems existing in the current work of secondary specialized education are inseparable from the shortcomings in the leadership of the Central Ministry of Higher Education.

Finally, Zeng Zhaolun pointed out in his report that only by correctly solving the above shortcomings and problems can we ensure that the cadres we train can guarantee the victorious advance of the country's industrialization cause. He put forward suggestions for improvement on the guiding principles and tasks of secondary specialized education in the future, as well as the main problems currently existing, for the conference to discuss.

After Zeng Zhaolun's report, Yang Xiufeng, Vice Minister of the Central Ministry of Higher Education, spoke, emphasizing that this conference should focus on studying and resolving the leadership relations of secondary specialized schools and the issue of correctly learning from the advanced teaching experience of the Soviet Union. He also asked everyone to examine the shortcomings in their work with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and to further learn from the Soviet Union better.

Li Litian, Deputy Director of the Secondary Technical Education Department of the Central Ministry of Higher Education, also explained the draft decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on the teaching plans, teaching syllabuses, and leadership relations of secondary specialized schools.

Group discussion meetings and document reading will be held from the 8th.

Those attending the conference included the heads of the education departments and sections of the central business departments, the heads or representatives of the higher education bureaus and education bureaus of the major administrative regions and provincial and municipal education departments, the heads of relevant business departments of the major administrative regions, the principals of secondary specialized schools, and specially invited representatives from the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

    中央人民政府高等教育部
    召开全国中等专业教育行政会议
    【本报讯】　中央人民政府高等教育部召开的全国中等专业教育行政会议，七日在北京开幕。这次会议将着重讨论关于全国中等专业学校（包括中等技术学校）的领导关系及教学改革问题，并确定今后中等专业教育的方针和任务。
    会议首由中央人民政府高等教育部副部长曾昭抡作了关于整顿、改革中等专业教育的总结及今后工作的基本任务的报告。曾昭抡在报告中指出：几年来，在共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，适应着国民经济的恢复和发展，我国中等专业教育有了迅速的发展，为国家培养了相当数量的中等专业学校的毕业生，他们在国家经济建设战线上、在各个工作岗位上，起了一定的作用。但是在解放初期这种发展是缺乏统一的计划的，因而不能保证按照国家的需要来培养专业干部，毕业的学生许多不能胜任实际工作。这些学校的隶属关系也不明确，很难把学校办好。为了根本改变这种情况，根据政务院的指示，从一九五二年开始，对旧的中等专业教育进行了整顿与改革。到一九五三年九月为止，全国中等专业学校数即由原来的七百九十四所调整为六百五十一所。在调整、整顿过程中，不少业务部门克服了各种困难，为学校调配了干部和师资，在新建和扩建校舍充实教学设备方面也作了巨大的努力。中等专业学校的学制，在一九五三年也得到了整顿。在整顿的同时，根据苏联经验，各工业部及其他一些部门为所属的中等专业学校中设置了专业；为大多数已设置了专业的中等专业学校制定了教学计划，开始了教学改革。在教学改革方面，多数学校是积极贯彻执行的，他们学习了新的教学计划、教学大纲和有关教学改革的文件，明确了专业教育培养目标，建立与健全了教学组织与教学制度，改进了教学方法，加强了教学思想性，从而提高了教学质量。
    曾昭抡并指出：在这次调整整顿中，中等专业学校的领导关系，还没有得到彻底解决，仍存在着多层领导现象，急待解决。在教学改革工作中仍存在着不少缺点：首先，没有正确了解稳步前进与结合实际的意义，强调了困难，前进不够。其次，对改革教学内容、教学组织、教学制度、教学方法的整体性认识不明确。再次，对学习苏联经验的重要意义还了解不够，有的没有很好学习苏联经验，领会其精神实质，并认真运用。他并着重说明中等专业教育目前工作中存在的这些缺点和问题是和中央高等教育部的领导上的缺点分不开的。
    最后，曾昭抡在报告中指出只有正确地解决以上这些缺点和问题，才能使我们所培养的干部能保证国家工业化事业胜利地前进。他对今后中等专业教育工作的方针和任务，以及针对目前存在的主要问题并提出了改进的意见，供大会讨论。
    曾昭抡报告后，中央高等教育部副部长杨秀峰发言，强调指出这次会议应当着重研究解决中等专业学校的领导关系问题和正确地学习苏联先进的教学经验问题，他并要求大家以批评与自我批评的精神来检查工作中的缺点，进一步更好地学习苏联。
    中央高等教育部中等技术教育司副司长李蔺田并就中央人民政府政务院关于中等专业学校的教学计划、教学大纲及领导关系的决定的草案作了说明。
    会议八日起举行分组讨论会和阅读文件。
    出席这次会议的有中央各业务部门教育司、处的负责人、各大行政区高等教育局、教育局及省市教育部门负责人或代表、各大行政区有关业务部门负责人及中等专业学校的校长、中共中央宣传部特邀代表等。
