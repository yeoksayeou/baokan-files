    Twelve Girls
    Shao Yanxiang
    In Anshan there is a wide road,
    This road knows twelve girls,
    They pass by here every day,
    Arm in arm, going to the factory;
    On the roadside are two rows of tall poplar trees,
    The poplar trees also know these twelve girls,
    Listening to them always discussing problems,
    Listening to them always singing as they walk.
    Twelve girls,
    Lively and cheerful girls!
    They go to work earlier than others,
    They leave work later than others,
    They love labor as much as they love learning,
    They observe discipline as much as they observe time;
    The wind howls, the rain pours,
    No matter how long the road, they don't feel it's far.
    Once inside the factory, they tuck their braids into their work caps,
    Fasten their cuffs, and start working!
    Twelve girls,
    Bold and vigorous girls!
    Daughters of poor peasants, daughters of workers,
    Girls from Liaoyang, girls from Haicheng,
    They had this dream in the classroom before,
    Dreaming of growing up to be workers.
    Now they have graduated from senior primary school and really arrived at Anshan Iron and Steel,
    What could be more glorious than this?
    Participating in construction is like taking an exam,
    They feel happy and serious at the same time.
    Twelve girls,
    Conscientious and dedicated girls!
    The first exam took the first step,
    The first step stepped into the factory gate:
    Electric welding sparks – hearts thump thump,
    Hacksaw sends up golden stars – hearts blossom.
    Everything is new, everything is unknown,
    If they don't understand, they ask, not shy at all;
    They treat everyone as a teacher,
    They are the teachers' earnest students.
    Twelve girls,
    Diligent and hardworking girls!
    They have walked every ditch,
    No matter how dark, narrow, deep, or muddy it is;
    They know every oil pipe well,
    Knowing its cold, knowing its heat, knowing its temperature.
    It's not that they haven't encountered difficulties,
    Pairs of eyebrows furrow and then relax –
    Every day, every hour is like an exam, ah,
    All the exams, all have to get five points!
    Twelve girls,
    Clang, clang, good girls!
    Good, they have become workers like this,
    Standing on the lubricating worker's post like this:
    Laboring like workers, learning like students,
    Shouldering the cause of socialist construction.
    Young workers say, "I hope my younger sister is like them."
    Old workers say, "I hope my daughter can be like this too."
    But what do they think themselves?
    They think – they want to be as good as Sister Hao Jianxiu!

    十二个姑娘
    邵燕祥
    在鞍山有一条宽广的马路，
    这马路认得十二个姑娘，
    她们每天从这儿经过，
    手挽着手儿上工厂；
    在道旁有两行高大的杨树，
    杨树也认得这十二个姑娘，
    听她们老是讨论着问题，
    听她们老是边走边唱。
    十二个姑娘，
    活活泼泼的姑娘！
    她们上班去比别人早，
    她们下班走比别人晚，
    她们爱劳动就像爱学习，
    她们守纪律就像守时间；
    风飕飕地刮，雨哗哗地下，
    路再长也不觉得远。
    一进厂，小辫儿卷进工作帽，
    扣紧了袖口，说干就干！
    十二个姑娘，
    泼泼辣辣的姑娘！
    贫农的女儿，工人的女儿，
    辽阳的姑娘，海城的姑娘，
    从前在课堂里就做过这梦，
    梦见自己长大了做个工人。
    如今高小毕了业，真的到了鞍钢，
    还有什么比这个更光荣？
    参加建设等于参加考试，
    心里又喜欢，又是沉重。
    十二个姑娘，
    兢兢业业的姑娘！
    第一次考试迈出了第一步，
    第一步迈进了工厂大门：
    电焊迸火花——心里嘣嘣跳，
    钢锯窜金星——心花开放了。
    样样都新奇，样样不懂，
    不懂就问，一点不认生；
    她们把每个人当做老师，
    她们是老师的认真的学生。
    十二个姑娘，
    勤勤恳恳的姑娘！
    每一条地沟她们走过，
    不管它又黑，又窄，又深，又泥泞；
    每一条油管她们摸熟，
    知冷，知热，知道它的体温。
    也不是没有遇到过困难，
    一双双眉毛皱紧又放松——
    每一天、每点钟都像考试啊，
    所有的考试，全都得五分！
    十二个姑娘，
    叮叮当当的好姑娘！
    好啊，她们就这样成了工人，
    就这样站到了润滑工的岗位上：
    像工人样地劳动，像学生样地学习，
    把社会主义建设事业扛上了自己肩膀。
    青年工人说，“希望我的妹妹跟她们一样。”
    老年工人说，“但愿我的女儿也能够这样。”
    可是她们自己是怎样想啊？
    她们想——要像郝建秀姐姐一样棒！
