    The Tianjin Power Machine Factory, a state-owned enterprise, has been steadily increasing its product output and production balance due to further strengthening its management work centered on work plans. From January to May of this year, the output of diesel engines and air compressors increased by 1.45% compared to the plan. In the past, the assembly workshop could only produce finished products sporadically in the latter half of each month; now, it can produce one finished product every ten hours.

    The Tianjin Power Machine Factory has a relatively strong foundation in production management. In the second half of last year, after the factory implemented the advanced experience of "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts," it grasped the flow of work-in-progress, strengthened production coordination between workshops, and was able to complete monthly production plans on schedule. In January of this year, the factory leadership further advanced the planning management work and implemented shift work plans in the light and heavy machining workshops. The shift work plan involves issuing daily production tasks to each shift, based on machine tool and individual worker, after issuing the work plan for each ten-day period of the month. Workers can foresee what work they will be doing today, how much they will be doing, and when they will supply the next process from the planning chart, which greatly strengthens their collective consciousness in production. They not only improve their skills and work hard to complete their tasks, but also help with management work. Workers in the heavy machining workshop check the completion of the production plan every day. The planing machine team calculated that due to the improvement of production efficiency in the whole workshop by more than 20%, the labor hours for planing were insufficient, so they collectively studied and proposed eight rationalization proposals for improving tools, overcoming the difficulty of unbalanced equipment capacity. After implementing the shift work plan, the workers in the light machining workshop put forward more than 30 suggestions for improving tools and promoting multi-tool and multi-edge cutting methods and the Kolesov tool method. Lu Deming, a young worker from the piston group, proposed three rationalization proposals for improving tools. If they are implemented on schedule, 577 labor hours can be added throughout the year. Liu Hongyou, a worker in the classification group, was assigned to turn diesel engine steel pipes. The quota time was nine minutes to process one. He tried to implement the Kolesov tool method, and now he can process one in 48 seconds.

    With the shift work plan, scheduling personnel have also been freed from their past busy work. They can purposefully go into the workshops to understand the situation of balanced production. According to statistics from the production scheduling department, time wasted due to apprentices' poor skills resulting in rework of semi-finished products and temporary search for drawings and tools accounted for 55.6% of all wasted labor hours. In order to overcome these shortcomings, staff members of various functional departments of the factory cooperated with each other. On the one hand, they implemented a system of assigning machines, jobs, and people to enable apprentices to specialize in production and improve their skills. On the other hand, they formulated a production preparation work plan every month and implemented it regularly. After the implementation of these two measures, the wasted labor hours caused by rework and insufficient production preparation have been reduced, the production efficiency has increased by 10%, and the assembly workshop is guaranteed to produce finished products on schedule.

    The weakest link in the production of the Tianjin Power Machine Factory is the foundry workshop. Now, this workshop has also changed its labor organization and implemented a work plan, and the production situation has changed.

### 天津动力机厂加强计划管理生产逐月提高

    天津动力机厂加强计划管理生产逐月提高
    国营天津动力机厂由于进一步加强了以作业计划为中心的管理工作，产品产量和生产均衡率逐月提高。从今年一月到五月，柴油机和空气压缩机的产量比计划提高了百分之一点四五。装配车间过去在每月下旬才能陆续出产成品，现在每隔十小时就可出产一台成品。
    天津动力机厂是一个生产管理较有基础的工厂。去年下半年，全厂推行了“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的先进经验后，掌握了在制品的流动情况，使车间的生产协作加强，每月的生产计划能够按期完成。今年一月份，工厂领导方面又把计划管理工作推进一步，在轻型和重型两个机工车间实行了轮班作业计划。轮班作业计划就是每月排出每旬的作业计划后，再以班为单位，按机床、按人每日下达生产任务。工人们从计划图表上可以预先知道自己今天要做什么活，做多少，什么时候供给下一道工序，所以生产中的集体观念大大加强。他们不仅改进技术努力完成自己的任务，并且协助做好管理工作。重型机工车间的工人们每天检查生产计划的完成情况。蹚床小组计算出由于全车间生产效率提高百分之二十以上，蹚床劳动工时不足，就集体研究提出八项改进工具的合理化建议，克服了设备能力不平衡的困难。轻型机工车间的工人们在执行轮班作业计划后，提出了三十多件改进工具和推行多刀多刃切削法、科列索夫车刀法的建议。活塞组青年工人陆德明提出了三项改进工具的合理化建议，如果按期实现，全年就可以增加五百七十七个劳动工时。归类组工人刘洪友车柴油机钢管，定额工时规定九分钟加工一个，他想法实行科列索夫车刀法，现在四十八秒钟就能加工一个。
    有了轮班作业计划，也使调度人员从过去的繁忙工作中摆脱出来。他们有目的地深入车间了解均衡生产的情况。据生产调度部门的统计，由于徒工技术差造成半成品回修和临时找图纸、找工具的时间，占全部浪费工时的百分之五十五点六。为了克服这些缺点，工厂各职能部门工作人员互相配合，一方面实行了定机器、定活、定人的制度，使徒工能够专件生产，提高技术；另一方面每月订立生产准备工作方案，定期实现。这两项措施实行后，因回修和生产准备不足而造成的浪费工时已经减少，生产效率提高百分之十，保证了装配车间按规定时间出产成品。
    天津动力机厂生产上最薄弱的环节是铸工车间。现在，这个车间也因改变劳动组织，实行作业计划，生产情况有了改变。
