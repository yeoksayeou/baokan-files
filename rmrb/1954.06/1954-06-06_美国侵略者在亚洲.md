American Aggressors in Asia

　　Air Transporting Taiwan Bandits to Thailand

　　TASS, Delhi, May 17th: Under the secret planning of notorious American special agent, the American Ambassador to Thailand, Donovan, a portion of the remnant bandit troops from Taiwan are being transported to Thailand by planes of Chennault's airline. These bandit troops are now mainly gathered in Chiang Mai, northern Thailand, because it is close to both Indochina and the area where Li Mi's remnant bandits are active in Burma. It is said that many American officers are currently training these remnant bandits there, so that they can be sent to Indochina to fight in the future.

　　When this new conspiracy planned by the US and Chiang was exposed, the Taiwan remnant bandits tried their best to deny it to the Taipei correspondent of the Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun," which only exposed the bandits' guilty conscience.

　　Koman's Outcry

　　United Press International, New York, May 29th: The Thai representative to the United Nations, Koman, suddenly began to shout about the "threat" of the Indochina war to Thailand. Koman acted like a helpless orphan, claiming that the United Nations should send some kind of "observation group" to the scene of the incident (Indochina) to "investigate." Moreover, on June 3rd, the United Nations Security Council, under the manipulation of the United States, actually passed this unreasonable request despite the opposition of the Soviet Union. Everyone remembers that just over a month ago, when the Dien Bien Phu war was fierce, Thai Foreign Minister Narathip stated that there was no indication that Thailand was under any direct threat (TASS, Bangkok, April 13th); but today, when the Geneva negotiations are resolving the Indochina issue, why is the Thai representative raising the issue of "threat" instead? The French "Combat" newspaper of May 26th said: "It is certain that the Bangkok government's initiative was proposed entirely after being instructed by the US State Department."

　　The Security Council's passage of Thailand's request is a signal of Wall Street's conspiracy to "internationalize" the Indochina war and undermine the Geneva Conference.

　　American "Photographers" in Nepal

　　The "Times of India" on May 20th said that some American "photographers" are rampantly active in strategic areas of northern Nepal, such as Mustang, Humla, and Jumla. They are trying to win over the local people with all sorts of deceptive tricks to cover up their criminal activities. But this was finally exposed by the Nepali Congress Party's "New Nepal" weekly, which strongly condemned the "visits" of these "photographers." Everyone knows that in addition to these so-called photographers, other American spies active in Nepal, such as so-called climbers of the Himalayas and various "experts" and "missionaries," have appeared here before March and April. Although American officials like Mansfield, who have been to Nepal, clamored for what kind of "assistance" to Nepal, the Nepalese people do not welcome them.

　　The True Colors of "US Aid"

　　According to a report by a special committee of the Indian Parliament, a batch of tractors recently shipped to India by the United States were of very poor quality and often needed to be disassembled for repair. The same was true for other items such as plows and trucks, which broke down as soon as they were used. This "aid" caused India a loss of 6,832,000 rupees. According to a TASS dispatch from Delhi on May 15th, it was not the first time that India had been deceived. In the past, the wheat shipped to India by the United States was already rotten.

　　Wall Street's deceptive behavior is not only limited to India. People still remember that nearly five months ago, the United States caused a serious outbreak of chicken plague in Iran by giving a large number of plague-ridden chickens under the name of "technical assistance."

　　"US Aid" and disaster are forever inseparable!

    美国侵略者在亚洲
    空运台湾残匪到泰国
    据塔斯社德里五月十七日电讯消息，在著名的美国特务头子、美国驻泰国大使杜诺万阴谋策动下，一部分台湾残匪部队正被陈纳德航空公司的飞机运往泰国。现在这些匪军主要集结在泰国北部的清迈，因为那里既靠近印度支那，又靠近李弥残匪在缅甸活动的地区。据说，目前有不少美国军官正在那里训练这些残匪，以便将来开赴印度支那作战。
    当美、蒋策划的这一新阴谋被揭穿后，台湾残匪曾对日本“每日新闻”驻台北的记者竭力否认有这回事，但这正暴露了匪徒们的做贼心虚。
      科曼的叫嚷
    据合众社纽约联合国五月二十九日电讯消息，泰国驻联合国的代表科曼，忽然喊叫起印度支那战争对泰国的“威胁”来了，科曼装得像个无依的孤儿，声称要联合国派什么“观察团”到出事地点（印度支那）去“调查”。而且，六月三日，联合国安全理事会在美国操纵下！竟不顾苏联的反对而通过了这个无理的要求。谁都记得，仅仅在一个多月以前，正当奠边府战争激烈的时候，泰国外交部长那拉底曾声明说，没有迹象表明泰国受到任何直接威胁（塔斯社曼谷四月十三日电）；可是，今天正当日内瓦谈判解决印度支那问题的时候，为什么泰国代表反而提出什么“威胁”来了呢？五月二十六日的法国“战斗报”说：“可以肯定曼谷政府的这个创议完全是在美国国务院授意之后提出的。”
    安全理事会通过了泰国的要求，正是华尔街制造印度支那战争“国际化”、破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋的一个信号。
    美国“摄影师”在尼泊尔
    五月二十日的“印度时报”说，一些美国“摄影师”在尼泊尔北部的穆斯坦、胡米亚和朱姆拉等战略地区大肆活动，他们想出各种骗人的诡计，拉拢当地人民，来掩护他们的罪恶活动。但这件事终于为尼泊尔国大党的“新尼泊尔”周刊揭穿了，该刊并强烈指责这些“摄影师”的“访问”。大家知道，在尼泊尔活动的这些美国间谍分子，除了这些所谓摄影师外，三、四月以前，这里还出现过什么攀登喜马拉雅山的“探险家”以及各种“专家”和“传教士”。尽管曾经到过尼泊尔的美国官员如曼斯菲尔德之流嚷嚷着要对尼泊尔进行什么“帮助”，但是尼泊尔人民却不欢迎他们。
    “美援”本色
    据印度国会的一个专门委员会的报告说，近来，美国运给印度的一批拖拉机，质量非常低劣，经常需要拆开来修理，其他如耕犁和卡车也是这样，一用就坏了。这一项“援助”，曾给印度造成六百八十三万二千卢比的损失。据塔斯社德里五月十五日电讯说，印度受骗已经不是初次了，过去美国运到印度的小麦，就是已经腐烂了的。
    华尔街的这种欺骗行为，岂止对印度是如此，人们依然记得：近五个月前美国把大批瘟疫的鸡在“技术援助”的名义下，曾给伊朗造成了一场严重的鸡瘟。
      “美援”和灾难永远是形影不离的！
