Comrade N.S. Khrushchev's Speech at the Labor People's Rally in Prague on June 15th
    Dear Comrades, glorious working people of the city of Prague!

    Please allow me, on behalf of the Soviet people, to extend warm and fraternal greetings to you, and through you, to all the people of the Czechoslovak Republic. (Stormy and prolonged applause. Everyone shouts: "Hurrah!" "Long live the Soviet Union!")

    The Tenth Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia concluded today. The Congress demonstrated the unity and solidarity of the ranks of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and showed the Party's determination to continue to faithfully serve its people, and to fight selflessly for the happiness of the working people.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the workers, peasants and intellectuals of Czechoslovakia have made great achievements in consolidating their People's Democratic state and building the foundations of socialism.

    The Tenth Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia pointed out the achievements that have been made, and formulated broad plans for the future development of the economy and culture of the Czechoslovak Republic. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia put forward a fundamental and most important task at the Congress: to strive to continuously improve the living standards of the working people, to increasingly satisfy their material and spiritual needs, and to consistently care for the well-being of the people. Only by continuously increasing labor productivity in all sectors of the national economy, reducing product costs, practicing strict economy, and vigorously developing agriculture, will it be possible to victoriously achieve this task.

    The high degree of organization and enthusiastic work of the Congress, the profound and comprehensive discussion of the pressing issues of the Republic's future development, the spirit of complete unity among the delegates in adopting resolutions, the support of the Communist Party by other parties in the National Front, and the nationwide working people's trust in the Communist Party and their determination to support the Party's policies that you have demonstrated today - all of this makes people firmly believe that the decisions adopted by the Tenth Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia will be victoriously implemented. (Stormy and prolonged applause)

    The Soviet people greet and sincerely congratulate the Czechoslovak people on every new victory on the road to building a new life with joy. We can point out with great satisfaction that the Czechoslovak people and the Soviet people have firmly established a relationship of true brotherly friendship and close cooperation. (Stormy and prolonged applause) This friendship, which benefits the people of our two countries, will continue to develop and be strengthened. The Soviet Union will continue to be a loyal and reliable friend of the Czechoslovak Republic, a friend to rely on. (Stormy and prolonged applause. Everyone shouts: "Hurrah!" "Long live the Soviet Union!") The working people of Czechoslovakia can firmly believe this. (Stormy and prolonged applause. Everyone shouts: "Forever with the Soviet Union!" "Hurrah!")

    Our two peoples, engaged in great construction labor, are closely concerned with maintaining and consolidating peace. The enemies of peace are threatening mankind with a new world war. However, the people of all countries are increasingly actively advocating the maintenance and consolidation of peace.

    When we say that we hope to resolve international issues peacefully, we are sincere, but some government officials in capitalist countries see this as our weakness. They want to use this to deceive public opinion in their own countries.

    The Soviet Union has consistently pursued a policy of peace and resolutely striven for disarmament. The Soviet Union has always advocated and still advocates the unconditional prohibition of the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction. Previously, those who opposed disarmament and opposed the prohibition of atomic weapons said that the Soviet Union only made these proposals because it did not have atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons itself. But now, when we already have atomic weapons, and have even produced hydrogen weapons before others, we still suggest that we solemnly guarantee not to use such weapons, thereby completely prohibiting such weapons. Obviously, we want to achieve this goal not because of our weakness, but because we are actually pursuing a genuine peace policy for the benefit of the working masses. Whoever clings to a policy of strength and wants to intimidate us with threats is greatly mistaken. We are not neurasthenic, and threats cannot frighten us. We are used to this kind of policy. Hitler once pursued this policy. But what was the result? Hitler died long ago, but our people are still alive and growing stronger. (Stormy and prolonged applause) Now, as our strength grows and is consolidated, we are even less afraid of any threats. The democratic and socialist camp has grown into a strong and invincible force, and it has become an indestructible fortress of peace. (Prolonged applause)

    Our starting point is the fact that the socialist camp and the capitalist camp can coexist peacefully. But we also know that peace will not come by itself; it must be achieved through consistent and unyielding struggle.

    To fight for peace is to strive for the peaceful resolution of international issues. We are doing this, and we will continue to do so without relaxation in the future.

    To fight for peace is to further improve the industry and agriculture of the People's Democratic countries and strengthen the national defense of our countries, so that aggressors know: if anyone dares to touch us, they will be finished. (Prolonged applause) This explains why the Communist Party always calls on the working people of the People's Democratic countries—workers, peasants, and intellectuals—to continuously consolidate their own countries, increase their national wealth, and strive to improve the living standards of the people.

    The great Lenin and Stalin, the successor to Lenin's cause, taught us that the new social system can and should achieve victory because it has higher labor productivity. The struggle to increase labor productivity is the main task of the working people who are building socialism.

    Capitalists also demand high labor productivity. But in capitalist countries, the result of increased labor productivity is that a small number of capitalists become increasingly wealthy, while the material situation of the broad masses of working people deteriorates. In socialist and democratic countries, increased labor productivity benefits the working people themselves and guarantees their continuous growth in material well-being and cultural level.

    The main source of the great vitality and power of the countries of the democratic camp is the unbreakable friendship between our peoples, based on the principles of mutual sincere respect and equality. There is no doubt that the friendship between free and equal peoples will continue to develop and be consolidated, which will be a guarantee of the freedom and independence of our peoples and a guarantee of the victory of the struggle for world peace.

    We sincerely hope that the working people of Prague, the workers, peasants and intellectuals of Czechoslovakia, will achieve new and great victories in socialist construction and in the struggle for the further prosperity of the Czechoslovak Republic.

    Long live the people of all nationalities of the Czechoslovak Republic!

    Long live the National Front of the Czechoslovak Republic!

    Long live the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia - the vanguard of the working class and all working people of the Czechoslovak Republic!

    May the unbreakable brotherly friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia forever develop and be increasingly consolidated!

(Prolonged cheers resounded throughout the hall, everyone shouted: "Hurrah!" "Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union!" "Long live the Soviet Union!" "Eternal friendship with the Soviet Union!")

### 在六月十五日的布拉格市劳动人民大会上  尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的演说

    在六月十五日的布拉格市劳动人民大会上
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的演说亲爱的同志们，光荣的布拉格市的劳动者们！
    请允许我代表苏联人民向你们，并通过你们向捷克斯洛伐克共和国全体人民致热烈的兄弟的敬礼。（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声。大家高呼：“乌拉！”“苏联万岁！”）
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会今天闭幕了。代表大会显示了捷克斯洛伐克共产党队伍的一致和团结，表明了党决心今后仍然要忠实地为自己的人民服务，为劳动人民的幸福进行忘我的斗争。
    捷克斯洛伐克的工人、农民和知识分子们在共产党的领导下，在巩固自己人民民主国家、在建设社会主义基础方面都获得了很大的成就。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会指出了已经获得的成就，并拟订了今后发展捷克斯洛伐克共和国的经济和文化的广泛计划。捷克斯洛伐克共产党在代表大会上提出了一项基本的和最重要的任务：争取不断提高劳动人民的生活水平，日益满足他们的物质和精神需求并始终不渝地关怀人民的福利。只有在国民经济的所有部门不断提高劳动生产率、减低产品成本、厉行节约以及大力提高农业的基础上，才有可能胜利地实现这项任务。
    代表大会的高度组织性和热诚的工作，对共和国今后发展的迫切问题所作的深刻和全面的讨论，代表们在通过决议时的完全一致的精神，民族阵线的其他党派对共产党的支持，你们今天所表现的全国劳动人民对共产党的信任和支持党的政策的决心——所有这一切使得人们坚信：捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会通过的决定将被胜利地执行。（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）
    苏联人民满怀着愉快的心情迎接并衷心祝贺捷克斯洛伐克人民在建设新生活的道路上的每一个新的胜利。我们可以非常满意地指出：捷克斯洛伐克人民和苏联人民已经牢固地建立起了真正的兄弟友谊和密切合作的关系。（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）这种有利于我们两国人民的友谊将日益发展和巩固。苏联今后仍将是捷克斯洛伐克共和国的忠实可靠的朋友，可以倚仗的朋友。（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声。大家高呼：“乌拉！”“苏联万岁！”）捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民是可以坚信这一点的。（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声。大家高呼：“永远和苏联在一起！”“乌拉！”）
    从事伟大的建设劳动的我们两国人民，密切关心着维护和巩固和平。和平的敌人在以新的世界大战威胁着人类。但是，世界各国人民越来越积极地主张维护和巩固和平。
    当我们说我们希望和平解决国际问题这句话的时候，我们是诚心诚意的，而资本主义国家的一些政府人士却把这点看成是我们的软弱。他们想借此来蒙混自己国内的舆论。
    苏联始终不渝地执行着和平政策，坚决地为裁减军备而奋斗。苏联过去和现在始终主张无条件地禁止使用原子武器、氢武器和其他各种大规模毁灭性的武器。以前，那些反对裁减军备和反对禁止原子武器的人说：苏联所以提出这些建议，只是由于它自己没有原子武器和氢武器。而现在，当我们已经有了原子武器，而且比其他人先制造出了氢武器的时候，我们还是建议要郑重保证不使用这类武器，从而完全禁止这类武器。显然，我们要达到这一目的，不是由于我们的软弱，而是由于我们为了劳动人民群众的利益而在实际上执行着真正的和平政策。谁要死抱着实力政策，想以威胁来恫吓我们，那就大错特错了。我们不是神经衰弱者，威胁是吓不倒我们的。这种政策我们已看惯了。当时希特勒就曾执行过这种政策。可是结果怎样呢？希特勒早就死去了，但是我们的人民还活着而且日益壮大。（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）现在，当我们的力量增长并巩固了的时候，我们更加不惧怕任何威胁了。民主和社会主义阵营已成长为壮大的、不可战胜的力量，它成为坚不可摧的和平堡垒。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们的出发点是这样一个事实，即社会主义阵营和资本主义阵营是能够和平共处的。但是我们也知道，和平是不会自行到来的，必须经过始终不渝的和不屈不挠的奋斗才能取得和平。
    为和平而奋斗，这就是要力求和平解决国际问题。我们正在这样做，今后也要毫不放松地这样去做。
    为和平而奋斗，这就是要做到进一步提高各人民民主国家的工业和农业以及加强我们各国的国防，要使侵略者知道：如果谁敢碰一碰，就叫他完蛋。（经久不息的掌声）这就说明为什么共产党总是号召各人民民主国家的劳动人民——工人、农民和知识分子不断巩固自己的国家，增加本国的财富，努力提高人民的生活水平。
    伟大的列宁和列宁事业的继承者斯大林教导我们，新的社会制度由于有较高的劳动生产率，是能够而且应当取得胜利的。为提高劳动生产率而斗争是建设社会主义的劳动人民的主要任务。
    资本家也要求高度的劳动生产率。但是在资本主义国家内，劳动生产率提高的结果是：一小撮资本家日益富裕，而广大的劳动群众的物质境遇却日益恶化。在社会主义和民主国家内，劳动生产率的提高是有利于劳动人民自己，是保证他们的物质福利和文化水平的不断增长的。
    民主阵营各国的伟大的生命力和威力的主要源泉，就是以互相真诚尊重和平等的原则为基础的我们各国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊。毫无疑问，自由和平等的各国人民的友谊将日益发展和巩固，这将是我们各国人民的自由和独立的保障，是争取世界和平的斗争的胜利的保证。
    我们衷心希望布拉格的劳动人民、捷克斯洛伐克的工人、农民和知识分子在社会主义建设中，在争取捷克斯洛伐克共和国进一步繁荣的斗争中，取得新的巨大的胜利。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国各族人民万岁！
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国民族阵线万岁！
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党——捷克斯洛伐克共和国工人阶级和全体劳动人民的先锋队万岁！
    苏联和捷克斯洛伐克两国人民的牢不可破的兄弟友谊永远发展和日益巩固！
      （长时间的欢呼声响彻全场，大家高呼：“乌拉！”“苏联共产党万岁！”“苏联万岁！”“永远同苏联友好！”）
