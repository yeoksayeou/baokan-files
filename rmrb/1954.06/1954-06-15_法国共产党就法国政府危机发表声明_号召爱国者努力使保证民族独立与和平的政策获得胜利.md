Xinhua News Agency, Paris: According to TASS, due to the resignation of the Laniel government, French President Coty consulted with various parties on the 13th. He first conferred with the President of the National Assembly, Le Troquer, the President of the Senate of the Republic, Monnerville, and the Honorary President of the National Assembly, Édouard Herriot. Subsequently, he received a delegation from the Socialist parliamentary group and a delegation from the French Communist Party led by Deputy Chairman of the parliamentary group, Waldeck Rochet. Accompanying Rochet were Georges Marrane, Chairman of the Communist parliamentary group of the Senate of the Republic, and Waldeck L'Huillier, a member of the Senate of the Republic.

According to "l'Humanité," the representatives of the Communist parliamentary group issued a statement during their consultation with Coty, which was similar to the French Communist Party's statement on June 12th. "l'Humanité" published the French Communist Party's statement on June 12th on the 13th.

The statement said: "The National Assembly expressed its lack of confidence in the government by a vote of 306 to 293. The government crisis reflects the growing indignation of the French people against the unjust war against the people of Indochina.

"The government crisis also illustrates that the people disapprove of the implementation of policies that run counter to national interests, policies that have subjected the country to the fatal consequences of the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which our party has opposed from the outset.

"Recent government measures in Indochina, such as the early conscription, are typical military measures. Laniel and Bidault are intensifying pressure to secure the ratification of the disastrous Bonn and Paris treaties. They are accelerating the subordination of France to American millionaires day by day. Their downfall is a success for the forces of peace.

"Those who support the policies opposed by the people are still insisting that it is impossible to implement any other policies. In order to continue their policies, they are trying every means to form a government that is little different from the past governments, a government that would entrust French foreign policy to the Popular Republican Movement, a party that refuses to defend French national interests and sells out French interests.

"The vital interests of the people demand precisely the opposite: they demand the implementation of new policies and the formation of a new government.

"Since it has recently been possible to implement other policies, under these circumstances, the French Communist Party expresses its willingness to support the measures of a government that advocates an immediate 'ceasefire' and the creation of peace.

"The French Communist Party calls on the workers of the Communist and Socialist parties, all working people, and all French patriots to unite and act together, expressing their determination to ensure the victory of policies guaranteeing French national independence and peace."

    法国共产党就法国政府危机发表声明
    号召爱国者努力使保证民族独立与和平的政策获得胜利
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：由于拉尼埃政府已呈请辞职，法国总统戈蒂十三日曾与各方磋商。他首先和国民议会议长勒特罗盖、共和国参议院议长蒙纳维与国民议会荣誉议长爱德华·赫里欧进行了商谈。随后他接见了社会党议会党团代表团，和以议会党团副主席瓦德克·罗歇为首的法国共产党代表团。伴随罗歇的有共和国参议院共产党议会党团主席乔治·马拉纳和共和国参议院议员瓦德克·卢伊埃。
    据“人道报”报道，共产党议会党团代表在和戈蒂商谈时发表了一项声明，这项声明类似法国共产党六月十二日的声明。“人道报”十三日刊载了法国共产党十二日的声明。
    声明说：“国民议会以三百零六票对二百九十三票表示对政府不信任。政府危机反映出了：法国人民对于继续反对印度支那人民的不正义的战争日益愤慨。
    “政府危机同时说明了，人民不赞同执行和国家利益相违背的政策，这个政策使国家承受了马歇尔计划、北大西洋公约的致命的后果，而我们党自始就反对这个计划和公约。
    “最近政府对印度支那的措施如提前征兵，是典型的军事措施。拉尼埃和皮杜尔正加强压力，以求批准毁灭性的波恩和巴黎条约。他们加紧使法国一天比一天更从属于美国亿万富翁。他们的垮台就是和平力量的成功。
    “拥护正受到人民反对的政策的人们，现在仍在硬说执行任何其他的政策是不可能的。为了继续执行他们那种政策，他们企图千方百计地来成立一个和过去政府很少不同的政府，这个政府会委托人民共和党人来执行法国的外交政策，而人民共和党是一个拒绝维护法国民族利益的党派，是一个出卖法国利益的党派。
    “人民的切身利益要求恰恰相反，它要求执行新的政策和成立新的政府。
    “既然最近有可能执行其他的政策，在这种情况下，法国共产党表示愿意支持一个主张立刻‘停火’和缔造和平的政府的措施。
    “法国共产党号召共产党和社会党的工人们，全体劳动人民和全体法国爱国者，一致联合行动起来，表示决心使保证法国的民族独立与和平的政策获得胜利。”
