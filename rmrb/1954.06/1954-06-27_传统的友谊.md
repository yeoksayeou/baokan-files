    Traditional Friendship
    --Notes on the Visit of the Korean People's Delegation to China's Northeast
    Jin Feng
    I. The Stories of the Martyrs
    A snowy winter. In the dense forest, a group of anti-Japanese guerrillas huddle together around a campfire. The blazing flames illuminate their faces and warm their hearts. The biting cold wind sneaks in from behind them. They smile, they sing, filled with confidence in victory and hope for a happy tomorrow...
    This is an oil painting in the Northeast Martyrs Memorial Hall in Harbin, depicting the arduous and heroic struggle of the Northeast Anti-Japanese guerrillas. Below the painting are two lines from General Li Zhaolin's famous "Camping Song": "The fire warms the chest, the wind chills the back."
    On the morning of June 11th, the Korean People's Delegation visited this place. They stood transfixed before this oil painting. Among this group of guerrillas who shared life and death, endured hardships together, and fought a desperate struggle against the Japanese imperialists, were their glorious brothers of the same ethnicity – the one smiling while leaning on a gun, the one standing beside the red flag lost in thought, the one leaning forward listening to the song... Were they singing the melancholic "Arirang" or the cheerful "Yangsan-do"? The same campfire warmed the hearts of the guerrillas of both countries, the same merciless cold wind buffeted them, and tomorrow they would set out to fight – for the liberation of the Chinese nation, and for the liberation of the Korean nation.
    Walking along the memorial hall, the delegation members saw that throughout these immortal historical sites, the glory of the heroic Korean sons and daughters fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese sons and daughters was shining everywhere. In the center of the Anti-Japanese Memorial Hall, a pair of plaster statues particularly attracted the attention of the representatives – a female guerrilla carrying a wounded soldier on her back. The soldier looked into the distance, his face filled with determination and tranquility; the female guerrilla's face was full of anticipation, anxiety, hope, and stubbornness. This sculpture depicts a story of Sino-Korean friendship forged in blood. The wounded soldier was Tong Changrong, Secretary of the East Manchurian Special Committee of the CPC, who was leading underground work in the deep mountains while suffering from severe lung disease. Unfortunately, he was discovered by the Japanese invaders, and enemy cavalry surrounded the valley. At this time, Tong Changrong was carried out by a Korean female comrade, Wu Changshun, who was taking care of him. In the vast blizzard, the guerrillas' footprints were discovered by the enemy, and both comrades died heroically. But their glorious image stands here, becoming an immortal symbol of the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. Not far from this pair of heroic statues is the famous oil painting "Eight Heroines Throw Themselves into the River." Among the eight heroic daughters who faced the Mudan River, broke their guns, and calmly waded into the river, there were also Korean daughters.
    In the war relics exhibition hall of the Korean People's Army in Pyongyang, there was an oil painting depicting the Battle of Pochonbo, which recorded the heroic deeds of Marshal Kim Il-sung leading Chinese and Korean guerrillas across the Yalu River to attack Pochonbo. Here, the delegation members saw an oil painting entitled "One of the Four Crossings of the Yalu River," which seemed like a continuation of that Pochonbo battle oil painting. The painting depicted a dark, moonless night, a group of Chinese and Korean warriors paddling a raft, carrying guns on their backs. The Korean comrades who had returned victoriously were bidding farewell to their motherland across the Yalu River: "Goodbye, motherland, we will return."
    With even greater interest, the delegation members saw that their fellow countrymen and women directly aided the Chinese people's liberation war with their blood. Here was the diary of the Korean comrade Kim Byong-rin, stained with the hero's blood, on which the Korean characters could still be faintly recognized. Beside the portrait of the nineteen-year-old Korean warrior Kim Mun-sul was the gentle face of the meritorious Korean nurse Kang In-bok and her neatly written notes. They all sacrificed their lives in the war to liberate the Northeast. There were even more Korean comrades who fought all the way to Hainan Island, participating in the entire battle for the liberation of mainland China.
    The prosperity and happiness of the new China today are inseparable from the sacrifices of these martyrs. And in the blood of these martyrs, a large part is the blood of Korean sons and daughters. The head of the delegation presented a wreath of plain white flowers, inscribed with: "Glory belongs to the martyrs who established immortal feats for the motherland and the people!" Among these martyrs were Chinese sons and daughters, as well as Korean sons and daughters. The martyrs of both countries fought together against a common enemy, their blood flowed together, and their merits are also listed together. The traditional friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is also forever solidified together.

    II. The Meeting of Brothers of the Same Ethnicity

    Outside the car window flashed road signs written in Korean, and in the fields appeared Ajumma wearing white Korean dresses. In the paddy fields, dense and small seedlings planted in the Korean style swayed from side to side in the breeze, a Korean girl with a water jug on her head, wearing a white dress and a black skirt, walked lightly along the ridges, ... The special car carrying the Korean People's Delegation to China is now entering the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture of Jilin. The representatives looked at this familiar scenery with affectionate eyes. This fertile field, separated from Korea only by the Tumen River, was still a vast grassland and dense forest a hundred years ago. As early as after the Sino-Japanese War in 1894, Korean patriotic people gradually came here and opened up this land with their hardworking and brave hands. In 1919, the famous "March 1st" revolutionary movement took place in Korea, and Japanese imperialism intensified its suppression of the Korean people. As a result, this place became a base for Korean revolutionary patriots' anti-Japanese restoration movement. When the Japanese invaders occupied the Northeast in 1931, the Chinese and Korean people established an anti-Japanese united front in Antu, Helong, Hunchun, Yanji and other counties in Yanbian to resist the common enemy. The blood of the martyrs of both countries was shed all over the Changbai Mountain and the Tumen River. When the flames of war of the American imperialist invaders burned the Korean land, it also burned the hearts of the Korean people in Yanbian. They sent more than 8,000 outstanding sons and daughters across the river to the Korean front. Today, these sons and daughters, who have the same blood and language, the same struggle, and were nurtured by the same ancestors, are about to meet.
    The people of Yanji City, the capital of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, have been busy for three days. They were busy cleaning the streets and sweeping the houses; women were still washing clothes late at night; barbershops and bathhouses had people queuing from dawn to dusk... To dress neatly and cleanly to welcome their relatives. At the station, Shi Dongzhu, a soldier of the Anti-Japanese Democratic Allied Army era, paced anxiously back and forth there. At this moment, he remembered those arduous struggles more than 20 years ago, the people's resistance, the Japanese devils' massacres, the organization of the armed forces in the five counties of Yanbian, the Japanese army's crusade, the guerrillas' transfer to the deep mountains, the heavy snow blocking the mountains, the attacks in the forest... And what appeared particularly clearly in these memories was a young face - the face of Marshal Kim Il-sung. It was he who spent difficult years here with the peasants, and it was he who led the people here to arm themselves and conduct heroic struggles together with the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces and the Chinese people.
    Equally excited as him was the family member of the Anti-Japanese Democratic Allied Army martyr, Old Lady Jin Xinshu. Her husband, Jin Xuejun, was the secretary of the Yanji County Party Committee, and he sacrificed himself in the Hailun Massacre in 1942. Since then, more than ten years have passed, and the revolutionary cause to which Jin Xuejun devoted himself has been victorious. Old Lady Jin Xinshu and her children have also inherited Jin Xuejun's cause and become glorious Communist Party members. In the most difficult time for the Korean people, Old Lady Jin Xinshu sent her pair of children to the Korean front. Now, she is looking forward to the people coming from that heroic land as if she were welcoming her own children back.
    After the first wave of excitement in the meeting, half of the residents of the city poured into the welcome meeting. Young women wore colorful skirts and tops in pink, goose yellow, emerald green, light blue, azure blue, silver red... The older Ajumma wore white dresses and white headscarves. Toddlers were clapping their small hands, opening their small eyes to listen to those uncles, aunts, and aunties shouting to them: "Annyeonghaseyo (Hello)!"
    Female members of the art troupe's chorus, wearing pure white dresses, appeared in front of the audience, and the performance began. The national melodies of "Korea is Fighting" showed the solemn struggle of their brothers and sisters of the same ethnicity in the not-so-distant country, dedicating their youth, life, and love to independence and freedom. More than 30,000 people held their breath, and this song took them to the flames, to the battle. In "The Song of Construction," they also heard the voice of Korea, which they were concerned about and was being rebuilt:
    "Look! That city, that heroic city,
    Although bombed by the enemy and turned into ruins,
    But the people on this land defended it with their flesh and blood,
    And will rebuild it more beautifully.
    In the city, in the countryside,
    Establish magnificent triumphal arches,
    To welcome the warriors who defend this land."
    The delegation visited Yanbian University, Liming Collective Farm, and Jin Xinshu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yanji, and they saw the happiness of the Korean people in Yanbian. There is one college student for every seven hundred people, and 80% of farmers have joined mutual aid and cooperation. "This is our tomorrow!" the delegation members all said.
    The time of parting has arrived, the car is slowly moving forward, and the crowd of people saying goodbye stood on the hillside, slowly waving white handkerchiefs. Some people in the car had red eyes, some were crying softly. Leaving Yanbian was like leaving a beloved hometown. At this time, the crowd of people saying goodbye danced a farewell dance for the travelers according to ancient customs. The delegation members leaned out of the car, waving white handkerchiefs, and bid farewell affectionately in Korean again and again: "Ajumma, annyeonghi gaseyo, annyeonghi gaseyo (Mom, I wish you peace, peace)..."

    传统的友谊
    ——朝鲜人民访华代表团访问东北散记
    金凤
    一、先烈们的故事
    暴风雪的冬天。密密的森林中，一群抗日游击队员们围着营火，紧紧偎倚在一起。熊熊的火焰映红了他们的脸，温暖着他们的心胸。刺骨的冷风从他们的背后钻过来。他们微笑着，歌唱着，充满着对于胜利的信心和明天的幸福的希望……
    这是哈尔滨东北烈士纪念馆中一幅描绘东北抗日游击队员坚苦卓绝斗争的油画，画下面写着李兆麟将军著名的“露营之歌”中的两句诗：“火烤胸前暖，风吹背后寒”。
    六月十一日上午，朝鲜人民访华代表团来到这里。他们在这幅油画面前呆住了。在这一群同生死、共患难，和日本帝国主义者作着殊死斗争的游击队员中间，不是正有着他们光荣的同族兄弟吗——那倚着枪微笑的，那站立在红旗旁边沉思的，那身子向前正倾听着歌声的……那唱的是忧郁的“阿里郎”还是愉快的“阳山道”呢？同样的营火温暖着两国游击队员的心胸，同样的无情的寒风吹打着他们，明天他们就要出发去战斗——为了中华民族的解放，也为了朝鲜民族的解放。
    沿着纪念馆走去，代表团团员们看到在这些不朽的史迹中间处处闪耀着英雄的朝鲜儿女和中华儿女并肩战斗的光辉。在抗日纪念馆的中央有一对石膏塑像，特别吸引着代表们的注意——一个带枪的女游击队员背着一个负伤的战士。战士了望着远方，脸上是一片坚定、宁静的神色；女游击队员则是满脸的期待、焦急、希望和倔强。这雕塑表现了一个用鲜血凝结的中朝友谊的故事。负伤的战士是中共东满特委书记童长荣，他带着严重的肺病潜伏在深山里，指导敌后工作，不幸被日寇发觉，敌骑包围着山谷。这时童长荣被一位看护他的朝鲜女同志吴长顺背出去。在茫茫的大风雪中，游击队员的足迹被敌人发觉了，两位同志都壮烈牺牲了。但是他们光辉的形象却矗立在这里，成为中朝两国人民战斗友谊的不朽的象征。离这对英雄塑像不远的是著名的“八女投江”的油画。在那面对牡丹江，折断枪枝，从容涉入江中的八个英雄女儿中，也有着朝鲜女儿。
    在平壤朝鲜人民军的战迹展览馆里曾有一幅描绘普天堡战斗的油画，那是记载金日成元帅带着中朝游击队员越过鸭绿江袭击普天堡的英雄史迹的。代表团团员们在这里看到了一幅“四越鸭绿江之一”的油画，这幅画仿佛是那张普天堡战斗油画的续页一样。画面上画着暗云密布、没有月光的夜，一群中朝勇士们撑着木筏，背着枪。胜利归来的朝鲜同志正向着鸭绿江那边的祖国告别：“再见吧，祖国，我们会回来的。”
    带着更大的兴趣，代表团团员们看到他们的同族儿女用鲜血直接援助了中国人民的解放战争。在这里有染满了英雄鲜血的朝鲜同志金秉麟的日记本，上面隐约还可以辨认出朝鲜文的字迹。在十九岁的朝鲜战士金文述的遗像旁边，是立功的朝鲜女护士姜仁福的温柔的脸和她的写得整齐的笔记。他们都是在解放东北的战争中牺牲的。还有更多的朝鲜同志一直打到了海南岛，参加了全部中国大陆的解放的战斗。
    新中国今天的繁荣和幸福和这些烈士的牺牲是分不开的。而在这些烈士的鲜血中，有很大一部分是朝鲜儿女的鲜血。代表团团长献上素白的花圈，上写着：“光荣属于为祖国和人民建立不朽功勋的烈士们！”这些烈士们中间，有中国儿女也有朝鲜儿女。两国的烈士们为了反对共同的敌人进行了共同的斗争，他们的鲜血流在一起，他们的功绩也并列在一起。中朝两国人民传统的友谊也永远凝结在一起。
    二、同族兄弟的会见
    车窗外闪过一块块用朝鲜文写的路牌，田野中出现了穿白色朝鲜衣裙的阿妈妮。水田中按照朝鲜方式栽下的密密的细小的秧苗在微风中左右摇摆，一个顶着水罐、白衣黑裙的朝鲜姑娘沿着田埂轻盈地走着，……载着朝鲜人民访华代表团的专车现在进入吉林延边朝鲜族自治区了。代表们带着亲切的眼光观看着这一片熟悉的景色。和朝鲜只隔着一条图们江的这片肥沃的田野，一百年以前还是莽莽的草野和密密的森林。远在一八九四年中日战争以后，朝鲜的爱国人民就逐渐来到这里，用他们勤劳勇敢的双手开辟这块土地。一九一九年朝鲜发生了著名的“三一”革命运动，日本帝国主义加紧了对朝鲜人民的镇压。于是这里就成为朝鲜革命志士反日复国运动的根据地。当一九三一年日本侵略者占领东北，中朝两国人民为反抗共同的敌人，在延边的安图、和龙、珲春、延吉等县建立了抗日统一战线。两国烈士的鲜血洒遍在长白山麓和图们江畔。当美帝国主义侵略者的战火燃烧着朝鲜土地的时候，也燃烧了延边朝鲜族人民的心。他们派遣了八千多优秀的儿女渡江到朝鲜前线去。如今，这有着共同的血统和语言、共同的斗争、由同一祖先哺育出来的儿女就要见面了。
    延边朝鲜族自治区首府延吉市人民在三天以前就忙碌起来。他们忙着扫清街道，打扫房屋；妇女们深夜还在赶洗衣服；理发店和澡堂从清晨到深夜都有人在排着队……要打扮得干干净净整整齐齐来迎接自己的亲人。在车站上，抗日民主联军时代的战士石东洙，他焦急地在那里走来走去，在这一刻，他想起了二十多年以前那些艰苦的斗争，人民的反抗，日本鬼子的大屠杀，延边五县武装部队的组织，日本军队的讨伐，游击队转移到深山，大雪封山，森林中的出击……而在这些回忆中出现得特别鲜明的是一张年轻的脸孔——金日成元帅的脸孔。就是他在这里和农民一起度过艰难的岁月，就是他领导这里的人民武装起来和抗日联军一起，和中国人民一起进行了英勇的斗争。
    和他同样激动的是抗日民主联军烈士家属金信淑老太太。她的丈夫金学俊是延吉县区委书记，因为海伦惨案在一九四二年牺牲的。从那时起，十多年过来了，金学俊所献身的革命事业已经胜利，金信淑老太太和她的子女也都继承了金学俊的事业，成为光荣的共产党员。在朝鲜人民最艰难的时候，金信淑老太太把自己的一对儿女送往朝鲜前线。如今，她像迎接自己的子女归来一样期待着从那英雄国土上来的人民。
    在会见的第一阵激动以后，全城二分之一的居民都涌到欢迎大会上来了。年轻的妇女穿着粉红的、鹅黄的、翠绿的、水蓝的、天青的、银红的……各色鲜艳的彩裙和上衣，上年纪的阿妈妮穿着白衣裙，包着白头帕，刚刚会走路的小孩子在拍着小巴掌，睁圆小眼睛听那些叔叔、伯伯、阿姨们对他们喊着：“安宁哈西姆尼卡（你好）！”
    艺术团合唱团穿着纯白衣裙的女团员出现在观众前面，表演节目开始了。“朝鲜在战斗”那富有民族色彩的旋律显示着那在不远的国度里他们的同族兄弟为独立自由献出青春、生命和爱情的庄严的斗争。三万多人的呼吸屏息着，这歌声带他们到烈火中，到战斗中。在“建设之歌”中他们又听到他们所关心的正在重建中的朝鲜的声音：
    “看啊！那座城呀，那英雄的城市，
    虽被敌人轰击而成了废墟，
    但是这土地上的人民用血肉保卫了它，
    而且会重新把它建设得更美丽。
    在城市里，在乡村里，
    建立起壮丽的凯旋门，
    迎接保卫这土地的勇士。”
    代表团在延吉访问了延边大学，黎明集体农庄和金信淑农业生产合作社，他们看到延边朝鲜族人民的幸福。每七百个人中有一个大学生，百分之八十的农民参加了互助合作。“这是我们的明天！”代表团员们都这样说。
    分别的时间到了，车子慢慢向前移动着，送别的人群站在山坡上，用手慢慢地挥着白手帕。车中有人眼圈红了，有人轻轻地哭了，离开延边真像离开亲爱的故乡一样。这时送别的人群按着古老的风俗给远行人跳着离别的舞蹈。代表团团员们都把身子探出车外，挥着白手帕，一遍一遍亲切地用朝鲜话告别：“阿妈妮，安宁哈西泼育，安宁哈西泼育（妈妈，祝你平安，平安）……”
