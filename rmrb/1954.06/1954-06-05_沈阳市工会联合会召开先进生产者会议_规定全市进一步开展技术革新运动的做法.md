    规定全市进一步开展技术革新运动的做法
    据新华社讯：沈阳市工会联合会在六月二日举行先进生产者会议，动员全市职工广泛地开展技术革新运动。
    沈阳市各国营、地方国营工厂的技术革新运动，在去年年底已局部展开，今年二月底全市召开工厂企业劳动模范代表会议后，这一运动就逐渐扩大到一百二十多个工厂。到第一季度末的统计，全市已出现了一万一千多件有关技术革新的建议，其中五千多件已经在生产上发挥了作用。
    这次先进生产者会议上肯定了过去技术革新的成绩，并按照中华全国总工会“关于在全国范围内开展技术革新运动的决定”的精神，规定了在全市各工厂进一步开展技术革新运动的做法。
    沈阳市工会组织的干部已积极学习和讨论中华全国总工会关于在全国范围内开展技术革新运动的决定。五月二十七日，沈阳市各报刊载这个决定的当天，中国第一机械工会沈阳市委员会就召开了驻会委员会议，学习了中华全国总工会的决定和赖若愚的报告，进一步认识了开展技术革新运动是把劳动竞赛向前推进一步，保证全面完成并争取超额完成国家经济计划的重要意义。他们并在当天通知所属各基层工会组织学习和讨论这个决定。沈阳造纸厂工会组织二十七日下午也召开基层工会委员会议，讨论中华全国总工会的决定，并且进一步研究了本厂开展技术革新运动的情况。地方国营电器材料厂的工会干部也组织了讨论，并决定召开技术革新积极分子会议，学习全国总工会的决定，检查处理合理化建议中的一些问题。
