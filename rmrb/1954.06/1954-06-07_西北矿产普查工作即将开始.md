    Northwest Mineral Survey Work to Begin Soon
   [Our newspaper dispatch] Northwest mineral survey work is about to begin. The survey area extends from the western bank of the Yellow River in Shaanxi in the east to the Hexi Corridor in the west, and from the middle section of the Helan Mountains in the north to the Qinling Mountains in the south, including eleven key areas in the four provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia.
    According to the requirements of the Central Geological Department for carrying out a large-scale national mineral survey, the coalfield area is the largest in this Northwest mineral survey, accounting for about two-thirds of the total survey area, and the iron ore survey area also accounts for a large proportion. This mineral survey will further identify a large number of mineral reserve areas for the country.
    The survey team is composed of more than 240 graduating students from the "Mineral Geology and Exploration" major of the Geology Department of Northwest University and the Northeast Institute of Geology. Led by technical cadres dispatched by the Northwest Geological Bureau and professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants dispatched by these two schools, they will conduct six months of fieldwork, closely integrating the completion of the national mineral survey with students' graduation internships.
    Before heading to the field, the teachers and students of these two schools studied and discussed documents such as the Northwest Mineral Survey Design, Technical Operating Procedures, Survey Work Methods, and Ethnic Policies in Xi'an and Shenyang, respectively. The five work teams composed of students from the Geology Department of Northwest University have departed successively since June 4th; the students transferred from the Northeast Institute of Geology to participate in the survey work in the Northwest will arrive in Xi'an in early June, striving to reach all designated areas in mid-June and fully commence work.

    西北矿产普查工作即将开始
   【本报讯】西北地区矿产普查工作即将开始。普查地区为东起陕西黄河西岸西至河西走廊，北起贺兰山中段南至秦岭山区，包括陕西、甘肃、青海、宁夏四个省十一个重点地区。
    根据中央地质部开展全国大规模矿产普查的要求，西北地区这次矿产普查面积以煤田为最大，约占这次普查总面积三分之二，铁矿普查面积也占很大的比重。经过这次矿产普查，将进一步为国家找出大量的矿产后备地。
    普查工作队，由西北大学地质系“矿产地质及勘探”专业和东北地质学院应届毕业学生二百四十多人组成。他们在西北地质局派出的技术干部和这两个学校派出的教授、讲师、助教带领下，将进行为期半年的野外工作，使完成国家矿产普查工作与学生毕业实习紧密的结合起来。
    在出发到野外工作以前，这两个学校的师生，分别在西安和沈阳两地，学习和讨论了西北矿产普查设计书、技术操作规程、普查工作方法和民族政策等文件。由西北大学地质系学生组成的五个工作队，已于六月四日起陆续出发；东北地质学院调来西北参加普查工作的学生，在六月上旬可以到达西安，争取在六月中旬全部到达指定地区，全面展开工作。
