Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 13th - The middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the Han River basin have safely passed the first flood peak of this year. The water level is now gradually receding, and the people along the banks are inspecting and repairing the dikes, preparing to meet the major flood season.

In late May and early June, the Han River and the Yangtze River successively experienced their first flood peaks. At the same time, the water levels of the tributaries of the Yangtze and Han Rivers were also very high. Before and after the arrival of the flood peaks, various places along the rivers mobilized large numbers of peasant masses to guard the dikes, preventing accidents. In Qichun County, the river water rose to only three centimeters from the top of the newly built levee. The local Party and government leading organs mobilized more than 8,000 peasant masses and more than 500 cadres to fight the flood continuously for five or six days and nights, safely passing the dangerous period. At present, the counties along the banks are carrying out preparations for flood prevention in full swing. Flood control headquarters above the county level have been established, and flood control materials have been basically prepared. Under the leadership of the local flood control headquarters, the broad masses of peasants are using methods such as cone penetration to conduct a general survey of the dike bodies; and under the principle of not delaying flood control and production, they are vigorously repairing dangerous works and sections. Each township in Hanchuan County has organized a shock team of more than 15 people to patrol the dikes day and night. The middle reaches engineering bureau of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission and the joint flood and drought prevention headquarters of Hubei Province have sent eight working groups to various places to check the flood prevention preparation situation.

    长江中游和汉水流域
    安全度过今年第一次洪峰
    【新华社武汉十三日电】长江中游和汉水流域已安全度过今年首次洪峰。现在水位已逐渐低落，沿岸人民正在检修堤防，准备迎接大汛。
    五月下旬和六月上旬，汉水、长江相继出现第一次洪峰。同时长江、汉水各支流的水位也很高。洪峰来到前后，江、河沿岸各地都动员了大批农民群众上堤守护，防止了出险。蕲春县河水涨到离新修大堤顶端仅三公分。当地党政领导机关动员八千多农民群众和五百多个干部连续和洪水搏斗五六昼夜，安全度过险期。目前，沿岸各县正在紧张进行防汛的准备工作。县以上的防汛指挥部都已成立，防汛器材已基本准备就绪。广大农民群众正在当地防汛指挥部领导下运用锥探等办法普查堤身；并在防汛、生产两不误的原则下，大力培修险工、险段。汉川县每乡都组织了十五人以上的突击队，日夜巡查堤防。长江水利委员会中游工程局和湖北省防汛防旱联合指挥部已派出八个工作组分赴各地检查防汛准备情况。
