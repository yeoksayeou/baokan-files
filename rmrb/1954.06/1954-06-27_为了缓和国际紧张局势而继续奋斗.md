    The International Conference for the Relaxation of Tensions, held in Stockholm, after five days of discussion, has reached a consensus on the current situation and measures to ease the situation, and has made a general resolution, passed a letter to the Geneva Conference, and a letter to the United Nations regarding the situation in Guatemala. The fact that public leaders from thirty countries in the East and West freely gathered to work towards easing international tensions is in itself of great significance. The voices of peace they have issued, and the beneficial suggestions they have made, not only reflect the good wishes of millions of people, but also precisely the goals that far-sighted politicians in various countries are pursuing. Therefore, the conference will clearly play a positive role in the current situation.
    The Korean armistice has greatly encouraged the common demand and common belief of the world's people that international tensions must and can be eased. A characteristic of the development of the international situation is that more and more socio-political figures in various countries recognize that easing international tensions, thereby promoting understanding and normal relations between East and West, is entirely in line with the interests of peace and security of all countries, and is possible. Therefore, the movement to ease international tensions is increasingly deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and is expanding in scale. The resumption of long-interrupted consultations among major powers, the convening of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the Geneva Conference, and international contacts on atomic energy issues and other issues, all indicate that this movement has produced significant results. However, powerful groups in the United States, who regard the "Cold War" as the source of their greatest profit, are extremely hostile to any possible easing of the international situation. They are doing everything possible to obstruct and undermine the negotiated settlement of international disputes, and are constantly trying to provoke new international conflicts. It is precisely because of this obstruction that the Berlin Foreign Ministers Conference, despite the many conciliatory and constructive proposals put forward by the Soviet Union, still failed to resolve the German question. The Geneva Conference negotiations on the Korean issue have been brutally interrupted, and the negotiations on restoring peace in Indochina have not yet been able to achieve a complete agreement quickly. Now, the United States has provoked a war of aggression against Guatemala. It is entirely understandable that public leaders from various countries feel the need to take on the responsibility of maintaining peace.
    In its general resolution, the International Conference for the Relaxation of Tensions, based on the experience of the conference, proved that "agreement is possible on most of the issues that currently divide the world." At the same time, the conference believes that "differences in social and political systems are not in themselves an inevitable cause of war. Peaceful coexistence is entirely possible as long as the rights of the people of all countries, large and small, are recognized in law and in fact." This common conclusion reached by public leaders from Eastern and Western countries is of particular significance.
    The resolution of the International Conference for the Relaxation of Tensions calls for the resumption of the interrupted negotiations on the Korean issue as soon as possible, and attention to the urgency of preventing the danger of a resurgence of war in this part of the world. The resolution also believes that in order to create an atmosphere conducive to resolving the Korean issue, it is necessary to ensure that both sides strictly abide by the terms of the armistice agreement, especially those concerning the transportation of armaments to the warring parties. This is a very timely and practical appeal. After the negotiations on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference were forced to end, the Syngman Rhee puppet group, under the wing of the United States, has been clamoring that it will no longer abide by the armistice agreement. The United States and the Syngman Rhee group are also trying to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in order to freely destroy the provisions of the armistice agreement regarding the prohibition of the import of reinforcing weapons and military materials. This is clearly pursuing the intensification of tensions in Korea and the resurgence of war. However, the Korean Armistice Agreement must not be undermined, and the Korean people's demand to obtain security, independence, national unification, and the right to choose their own socio-political system through free and democratic elections throughout the country, cannot be obliterated by any force. A peaceful solution to the Korean issue has not and cannot be removed from the agenda of international consultations. The three countries of North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, at the last meeting of the Geneva Conference to discuss the Korean issue, advocated that negotiations on the Korean issue should be resumed in the future. British Foreign Secretary Eden also stated in a speech in the British House of Commons on June 23 that "the proposal to continue negotiations (on the Korean issue) remains valid" and "the armistice agreement remains in effect." It can be seen that the forces attempting to block the path to a peaceful solution to the Korean issue and restore the Korean War are very isolated; their plots cannot succeed. The broad masses of people and public opinion in various countries demand the consolidation of peace in Korea and continue to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue through consultation. This peaceful aspiration cannot be ignored.
    Currently, the focus of attention of the public in various countries is the negotiations on the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference. The general resolution of the International Conference for the Relaxation of Tensions pointed out: "As far as the Indochina issue is concerned, the Geneva Conference can and must succeed." The conference calls on the governments meeting in Geneva: 1. To work together to achieve a ceasefire in the three countries of Indochina as quickly as possible through an agreement between the warring parties. 2. To avoid taking any measures and actions that may lead to the continuation and expansion of the Indochina war, thereby further increasing the danger of a world war. 3. To ensure the speedy conclusion of a peace agreement between France and the three countries of Indochina on the basis of respecting the sovereignty, national independence, unity of the people of the three countries of Indochina, respecting their democratic freedoms, and their right to freely choose their own political and social system. The aspirations expressed by the conference are in line with the actual situation in Indochina and the requirements for consolidating peace in Asia and the world.
    With the efforts of the delegations of Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union, and all forces that truly desire peace, the Geneva Conference negotiations on the Indochina issue have successively reached two agreements on direct negotiations between the military representatives of Vietnam and Laos and Cambodia, and arrangements for an early simultaneous ceasefire throughout Indochina. The plots of the enemies of peace to undermine and obstruct the conference from reaching an agreement have been repeatedly frustrated, but they are not reconciled and are continuing to try to organize a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc to continue and expand the war.
    When the people of the world unanimously demanded an end to the Indochina war, the enemies of peace instigated an open armed aggression against the Republic of Guatemala. This act of aggression not only threatens the security of Guatemala, but also threatens the peace of Latin America and the world. It is clear that this is another conspiracy by American imperialists to invade a weak country. Therefore, we fully support the appeal of the International Conference for the Relaxation of Tensions to the United Nations Security Council, requesting the Security Council to take effective steps to restore peace in Guatemala.
    As pointed out in the general resolution of the International Conference for the Relaxation of Tensions, peace is indivisible. To ensure world peace, it is not only necessary to restore peace in Asia, but also to promote the consolidation of peace and security in Europe. It is known that the task of guaranteeing peace and security in Europe is closely related to the peaceful settlement of the German question and the prevention of the revival of German militarism. The Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference discussed the German question and the issue of guaranteeing European security. The Soviet delegation put forward a series of constructive proposals, but due to the obstruction of Western countries, no agreement was reached on these issues. After the end of the Berlin Conference, the Soviet government put forward further proposals on the establishment of a European collective security system and requested to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But it was still rejected by Western countries. The United States and some Western countries continue to pursue a plan to split Europe, split Germany, and revive German militarism, attempting to lead Europe on the road to another war. However, in Western European countries, especially in France, the movement advocating the establishment of European collective security and opposing the "European Army" is developing more and more widely and powerfully. An international conference of opponents of the "European Defense Community" was held in Paris on March 20, with more than 100 parliamentarians and well-known social leaders from Western European countries participating. The conference passed a resolution opposing the "European Defense Community," demanding the resumption of negotiations to resolve the German question and establish a European collective security system. Former French Prime Minister Daladier accused at the meeting that "every clause of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty is ambushed with war." He also pointed out:
  "The European Defense Community" is the main obstacle to international consultations. Those who attempt to force us to accept the "European Defense Community" are obstructing unity between countries. This is a real crime.
    Therefore, the International Conference for the Relaxation of Tensions advocated: "Negotiations on the German question must be resumed as soon as possible, and at the same time, no action should be taken that may hinder negotiations." This is entirely correct. The people of Europe and the world who love peace are carrying out unremitting struggles for this goal.
    Prohibiting the use of weapons of mass destruction and universal disarmament is also an important way to ease international tensions. Recently, the US-Soviet negotiations on atomic energy issues, which have been closely watched by the world, have made no progress; the meeting of the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission has also ended without results. The United States is not only unwilling to undertake the obligation not to use weapons of mass destruction and refuses to implement effective disarmament measures, but is also stepping up the race for atomic weapons and carrying out large-scale hydrogen bomb tests. This is clearly contrary to the peaceful wishes of the people of the world. The people of all countries in the world have unanimously expressed opposition to this behavior of the American imperialists and demanded the prohibition of atomic weapons and disarmament.
    The International Conference for the Relaxation of Tensions also suggested developing East-West trade and cultural exchanges between countries, believing that this is another important factor that helps to ease international tensions and promote the normalization of international relations.
    This international conference initiated and participated in by public leaders from Eastern and Western countries is a peaceful initiative. The results produced by their contact will play a significant role in the struggle for peace. They also decided to hold another larger conference in early 1955. The expansion of the movement to ease international tensions cannot be stopped by forces hostile to peace. Consultation will triumph over war.

    为了缓和国际紧张局势而继续奋斗
    在斯德哥尔摩举行的缓和局势国际会议，经过五天的讨论，已就当前的局势和缓和局势的措施，取得了共同一致的意见，并作出了总决议，通过了告日内瓦会议书和关于危地马拉局势的告联合国书。来自东西方的三十个国家的公众领袖自由地聚会来致力于缓和国际紧张局势，其本身就具有重大的意义。他们发出的和平声音，和提出的有益建议，不仅反映了千百万人的善良愿望，而且正是各国有远见的政治家正在从事的目标。因此，会议显然将会对目前的局势起着积极的作用。
    朝鲜停战大大鼓舞了世界人民对于必须和可能缓和国际紧张局势的共同要求与共同信念。国际局势发展的一个特点是，越来越多的各国社会政治人士，认识到缓和国际紧张局势，从而促进东西方之间的谅解和正常联系，是完全符合各国和平和安全的利益的，而且是可能的。因此，缓和国际紧张局势的运动，日益深入人心，规模不断扩大。长期中断的大国协商的恢复，柏林四国外长会议和日内瓦会议的召开，以及关于原子能问题和其他问题的国际接触，都表明了这个运动已产生了重大的结果。但是，把“冷战”视为最大利润的源泉的美国有势力集团，十分敌视国际局势任何可能的缓和，他们千方百计地阻挠和破坏国际争端的协商解决，不断设法挑起新的国际冲突。正是由于这种阻挠，使得柏林外长会议，虽然有苏联提出的许多和解性和建设性的建议，却依然未能解决德国问题。日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的谈判已被蛮横中断，恢复印度支那和平问题的谈判还未能迅速取得完全的协议。现在，美国又挑起了对危地马拉的侵略战争。各国公众领袖们感到有必要把维护和平的责任担当起来，是完全可以理解的。
    缓和局势国际会议在总决议中根据会议的经验证明：“在目前使世界分裂的大多数问题上达成协议是可能的”。同时，会议又认为，“社会和政治制度的不同，其本身并不是战争的必不可免的原因。只要大大小小的国家的人民的权利在法律上和事实上得到承认的话，和平共处是十分可能的”。东西方各国公众领袖得出这个共同的结论，有着特别重要的意义。
    缓和局势国际会议的决议要求尽快恢复已经中断了的朝鲜问题的谈判，并注意防止在世界上这一部分重新爆发战争的危险的迫切性。决议并认为，为了创造有利于解决朝鲜问题的气氛，必须保证双方严格履行停战协定的条款，特别是关于运送军备给交战方面的条款。这是十分适时和切合实际的呼吁。在日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的谈判被迫结束之后，在美国卵翼之下的李承晚傀儡集团已在叫嚷不再遵守停战协定，美国和李承晚集团并力图取消中立国监察委员会，以便放手破坏停战协定关于禁止输入增援性武器和军事物资的条款。这显然是在追求加剧朝鲜的紧张状态和战争之再起。但是，朝鲜停战协定是不容破坏的，朝鲜人民要求得到安全、独立、国家的统一和通过全国自由民主的选举选择他们自己的社会政治制度的权利，也是任何力量所不能加以抹煞的。和平解决朝鲜问题没有而且也不可能从国际协商的议程上勾销。朝、中、苏三国在日内瓦会议讨论朝鲜问题的最后一次会议上，即曾主张今后应当恢复朝鲜问题的谈判。英国外交大臣艾登六月二十三日在英国下院的演说中也认为：“关于继续进行（朝鲜问题）谈判的建议仍然是有效的”，“同时停战协定仍然有效”。由此可见，企图堵死和平解决朝鲜问题的道路，恢复朝鲜战争的力量是十分孤立的；他们的图谋是不能得逞的。各国广大人士和公众舆论要求巩固朝鲜和平，继续以协商方式谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决。这个和平愿望是不能忽视的。
    目前，各国公众注意的焦点，是日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的谈判。缓和局势国际会议的总决议中指出：“就印度支那问题而论，日内瓦会议是能够而且是必须成功的”。会议要求在日内瓦开会的各国政府：一、共同努力，以便通过交战双方的协议，在印度支那三个国家内尽可能迅速地实现停火。二、避免采取可能导致印度支那战争的继续和扩大、以致使世界大战的危险更为加剧的一切措施和一切行动。三、保证在尊重印度支那三国人民的主权、民族独立、统一、尊重他们的民主自由以及他们自由选择自己的政治社会制度的权利的基础上，尽速签订法国和印度支那三国的和平协定。会议所表达的这种愿望，符合于印度支那的现实局势和巩固亚洲与世界和平的要求。
    日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的商谈在越、中、苏三国代表团和所有真正愿望和平的力量的努力下，已先后取得了关于越南以及老挝和柬埔寨双方军事代表直接谈判，安排在印度支那全境早日同时停火的两项协议。和平的敌人破坏和阻挠会议达成协议的图谋已一再遭到挫折，但是他们还不甘心，正在继续设法来组织一个东南亚的侵略集团，以继续和扩大战争。
    当全世界人民一致要求停止印度支那战争的时候，和平的敌人向危地马拉共和国策动了公开的武装侵略，这种侵略行为不仅威胁到危地马拉的安全，而且威胁到拉丁美洲和全世界的和平。很明显，这是美国帝国主义者侵略弱小国家的又一阴谋。因此我们完全支持缓和局势国际会议对联合国安理会的呼吁，要求安理会采取有效的步骤来恢复危地马拉的和平状态。
    正如缓和局势国际会议的总决议所指出的，和平是不可分割的，要使世界和平获得保证，不仅要恢复亚洲的和平，而且必须促进欧洲和平与安全的巩固。人们知道，保障欧洲和平与安全的任务是与和平解决德国问题和防止德国军国主义复活密切相关的。柏林四国外长会议曾经对德国问题和保障欧洲安全问题进行了讨论，苏联代表团提出了一系列的建设性建议，但是由于西方国家的阻挠，未能对这些问题达成协议。柏林会议结束以后，苏联政府又就建立欧洲集体安全体系问题提出进一步的建议，并要求参加北大西洋公约。但仍遭到西方国家的拒绝。美国和一些西方国家继续推行分裂欧洲、分裂德国和复活德国军国主义的计划，企图把欧洲导向另一次战争的道路上去。可是，在西欧国家中，特别是在法国，主张建立欧洲集体安全，反对“欧洲军”的运动日益广泛而有力地开展起来。三月二十日在巴黎举行了“欧洲防务集团”反对者国际会议，参加者有西欧各国一百多个议员和著名社会领袖。会议通过决议，反对“欧洲防务集团”，要求恢复谈判以解决德国问题，建立欧洲集体安全体系。法国前总理达拉第在会上指责“波恩条约和巴黎条约的每一条款内都埋伏着战争”。他并指出：
  “欧洲防务集团”是国际协商的主要障碍，企图强使我们接受“欧洲防务集团”的人们阻挠各国间的团结，这是一个真正的罪行。
    因此，缓和局势国际会议主张：“必须尽速恢复关于德国问题的谈判，同时，不应该采取任何可能妨碍谈判的行动。”这是完全正确的。欧洲和全世界爱好和平的人民都正在为了这个目标，进行不懈的斗争。
    禁止使用大规模毁灭性武器和普遍裁减军备，也是缓和国际紧张局势的一个重要途径。最近全世界密切注意的美苏关于原子能问题的谈判，没有任何进展；联合国裁军委员会的小组委员会会议也已无结果而结束。美国不仅不愿意承担不使用大规模毁灭性武器的义务和拒绝实行有效的裁军措施，而且在加紧进行原子军备的竞赛，实行大规模的氢弹试验。这显然是和世界人民的和平愿望背道而驰的，世界各国人民对美帝国主义者这种行为一致表示反对，要求禁用原子武器和裁减军备。
    缓和局势国际会议还建议发展东西方贸易和各国间的文化交流，认为这是有助于缓和国际紧张局势并促进国际关系正常化的另一重要因素。
    东西方各国公众领袖发起和参加的这一次国际会议，是一种和平的创举。他们的接触所产生的结果，将对争取和平的斗争，起着重大的作用。他们还决定在一九五五年初再召开一次规模更大的会议。缓和国际紧张局势的运动的扩展，是敌视和平的势力所不能阻挡的。协商将战胜战争。
