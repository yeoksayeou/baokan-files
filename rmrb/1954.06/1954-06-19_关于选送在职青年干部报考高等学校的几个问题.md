Regarding Several Questions on Selecting and Sending On-the-Job Young Cadres to Apply for Universities
People's Letters Group, General Office of the Ministry of Higher Education

Recently, we have received many letters from the masses inquiring about the selection and recommendation of employed young cadres for enrollment in universities. We now provide a comprehensive response as follows:

The first question: The "Decision on Ensuring the Completion of the 1954 National University Enrollment Plan" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Party committees at all levels on May 20th pointed out that 5,000 young cadres should be selected from Party, government, and people's organizations at all levels above the county level to apply for various types of universities in accordance with the prescribed conditions. Has this quota of 5,000 been allocated? If there is no assigned task or if the number of selected young cadres exceeds the allocated quota, can they still be recommended to apply?

The quota for this selection and application has been allocated by the central government to major administrative regions, and by major administrative regions to various Party, government, and people's organizations. As for the figure of 5,000, it is the minimum requirement for the number of on-the-job cadres applying for the examination in order to ensure the full completion of this year's enrollment plan, and it is not a restriction on the number of applicants. Therefore, all organs that have been assigned a selection task must earnestly carry out their work and complete the task; organs that have not been assigned a selection task should also actively select young cadres who meet the selection conditions.

The second question: What are the application procedures for on-the-job cadres in government agencies to apply for universities?

In order to enable leading organs at all levels to cultivate and improve on-the-job cadres in a planned and step-by-step manner, on-the-job cadres in government agencies who apply for universities must first obtain the consent of their work unit. Then, they should present a letter of introduction from their work unit agreeing to the application (the letter of introduction should state age, education level, position, and length of service) and register with the local or nearby university enrollment committee on the specified date for a physical examination. After passing the physical examination, they should obtain the "Applicant Registration Form" and "Application Form," fill them out, and submit them to the enrollment committee. After the enrollment committee has reviewed and approved them, they will be issued an "Admission Ticket" and participate in the examination starting on July 15th.

On-the-job cadres in government agencies can take the first or second category of examination subjects according to their individual application wishes and are generally exempt from the foreign language subject.

If an on-the-job cadre in a government agency comes from a worker-peasant family or is a cadre of worker-peasant origin (this needs to be certified by the work unit), they may be given priority in admission if their examination scores reach the admission standards for the department or major they are applying for.

The third question: What are the benefits for on-the-job cadres in government agencies after being admitted to universities? Can all those within the 5,000 quota allocated by the central government enjoy the transfer cadre scholarship after enrollment?

The benefits for on-the-job cadres in government agencies after being admitted to universities depend on the individual cadre's conditions. Those whose conditions meet the regulations for transfer cadre scholarships will enjoy the transfer cadre scholarship; those whose conditions do not meet the regulations for transfer cadre scholarships will enjoy general student scholarships.

    关于选送在职青年干部报考高等学校的几个问题
    中央高等教育部办公厅人民来信组
    最近期间，我们收到许多群众来信，询问关于选送在职青年干部报考高等学校的问题，现综合答复如下：
    第一个问题：中共中央在五月二十日向各级党委发出的“关于保证完成一九五四年全国高等学校招生计划的决定”中指出，要从全国县以上各级党、政、人民团体等各机关青年干部中按规定条件选送五千人报考各类高等学校，这五千名额是否已经分配？没有分配任务或在分配名额之外是否还能选送青年干部报考？
    这项选送报考的名额，已经中央分配至各大行政区，由各大行政区分配至党、政、人民团体各机关。至于五千名的数字，是为了保证今年招生计划的全部完成而确定的名额，这是对于在职干部报考人数的最低要求，不是对报考人数的限制。因此，凡分配有选送任务的机关，要认真进行工作，完成任务；没有分配选送任务的机关，如果有具备选送条件的青年干部，也应主动积极选送。
    第二个问题：机关在职干部报考高等学校的报考手续怎样？
    为了使各级领导机关能有计划地、有步骤地培养提高在职干部，机关在职干部报考高等学校，首先要经过所在工作单位的同意。然后，持所在工作单位同意报考的介绍函件（介绍函件应注明年龄、文化程度、职别、工作年限），在当地或临近地区高等学校招生委员会规定日期登记，进行体格检查；体格检查合格后，再领取“考生登记表”、“报名单”填交招生委员会，经招生委员会审查合格，发给“准考证”，七月十五日起参加考试。
    机关在职干部报考者，按其个人报考志愿可分别应试第一、二类考试科目，一般可以免试其中的外国语科目。
    机关在职干部报考者，如系工农家庭出身或本人是工农成份的干部（这点需要所在工作单位证明），当其考试成绩达到所报考系科或专业类的录取标准时，可被优先录取。
    第三个问题：机关在职干部考入高等学校后待遇怎样？是不是凡在中央分配的五千人名额以内，入学后都可以享受调干助学金待遇？
    机关在职干部考入高等学校后的待遇，要看干部本人的条件而定，其条件合乎调干助学金待遇规定者，均享受调干助学金待遇；不合乎调干助学金待遇规定者，则享受一般学生助学金待遇。
