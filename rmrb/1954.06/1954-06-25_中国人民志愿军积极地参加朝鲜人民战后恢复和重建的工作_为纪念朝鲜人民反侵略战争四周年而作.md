    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Actively Participates in the Post-War Recovery and Reconstruction Work of the Korean People
    -- Written to Commemorate the Fourth Anniversary of the Korean People's Anti-Aggression War
    Li Zhimin, Deputy Political Commissar of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

    June 25th is a day that the Korean people, the Chinese people, and all peace-loving people around the world will never forget. On this day four years ago, American imperialism instigated the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique to launch an armed attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Korean people bravely began their war of resistance against America to defend their independence and freedom.

    The American imperialist-launched war of aggression against the Korean people was an unprecedentedly barbaric and brutal slaughter, plunder, and destruction. It used all the latest types of killing weapons and destructive means except for atomic bombs. Countless kind and hardworking Korean people died tragically under the butcher knives and bombs of American imperialism. Countless beautiful cities and villages built by the Korean people through generations of hard work and wisdom were also turned into ruins under the destruction of American aggressors' napalm bombs and heavy bombs. The immense losses caused to the Korean people by American imperialism's barbaric aggression are incalculable. American imperialism thought that this would destroy the conditions for the Korean people's survival and thereby conquer the Korean people's will to resist aggression. However, the enemy's plan completely and shamefully failed. The heroic Korean people not only waged an incomparably brave and tenacious fight against the enemy, but also, while fighting the enemy arduously, steadfastly carried out difficult recovery and reconstruction work on the ruins created by the enemy to ensure the victory of the war and a happy future life. These efforts of the Korean people ensured that the Republic smoothly weathered the most difficult days of the war and supported the Korean and Chinese People's Armies in achieving victory in the armistice. After the armistice was realized, the Korean people began an enormous and comprehensive recovery and reconstruction work with even greater determination and optimism, determined to quickly heal the wounds of war and rebuild their beautiful homeland with their own hardworking hands.

    The Korean people's anti-aggression struggle not only defended Korea's independence and freedom and defended the democratic base in the northern half of the Republic, but also made a great contribution to safeguarding the Chinese people's construction cause and the sacred cause of safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world.

    Bearing the glorious mission of resisting America and aiding Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in accordance with the instructions of the people of the motherland, closely united with the heroic Korean People's Army, fought side by side, jointly defeated the American aggressors, and, in the intervals between battles, helped the Korean people as much as possible to carry out production and restore their homes. In those difficult days of the war, our blood and sweat flowed together with the Korean people, solidifying the unbreakable fighting friendship between the two peoples and ensuring victory against the common enemy.

    Today, as the Korean people have begun large-scale post-war recovery and reconstruction work, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is very excited to see the Korean people's tenacious efforts and the great assistance of the great Soviet Union and our great motherland, as well as various fraternal countries, to the Korean people's recovery and reconstruction cause. While vigilantly guarding their positions, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army actively assists the Korean people in carrying out post-war recovery and reconstruction work. The railway troops of our army, which successfully ensured the rear transportation during the war, immediately threw themselves into the work of helping the Korean people restore the railways after the armistice. Within three months, they repaired, renovated, and built 308 new bridges, with a total length of more than 15,000 meters, and repaired more than 7,000 meters of railway lines and 37 stations, assisting the Korean railway staff in quickly restoring all the original railway lines in northern Korea. Our army also used a part of the engineering corps to fully participate in the construction of urban transportation and water conservancy projects, and in particular, an engineering corps gloriously participated in the reconstruction of the heroic city of Pyongyang. The garrison troops on all lines used the gaps to help the Korean people build water conservancy projects, restore schools and hospitals, build houses, and help carry out various other production labor in the vicinity of their garrison. For example, a unit of our army stationed on the west coast helped the Korean people build the dike of the Aesan River. This long dike, winding for more than 9,300 meters and accumulating more than 2.48 million cubic meters of soil, can benefit more than 500 hectares of land, thereby ensuring an annual harvest of 5,000 tons of grain. A unit in Chongsong-ri, Anju County, South Pyongan Province, helped the local people build the Daegyo River channel change project, excavating a river channel approximately 2,811 meters long, removing 160,000 cubic meters of earth, and repairing five canals and three dikes on both banks. After the river is diverted in this area, 500 hectares of rice paddies can be spared from floods, and the cultivated area can be increased by 10 hectares, with an estimated annual increase in grain production of 475 tons. A unit guarding the front line of Kimhwa helped residents near their garrison build 14 canals from January to April of this year, and also helped residents near their garrison build 578 houses. According to incomplete statistics, after the armistice, the various units of our army helped build more than 100 middle schools and primary schools in the garrison areas. During last year's autumn harvest, the various units helped local Korean farmers harvest nearly 10,000 hectares of various crops. This spring, the various units also universally helped farmers in the garrison areas carry out spring plowing and sowing.

    Under the great internationalist education, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army regards helping its closest comrades-in-arms, the Korean people, rebuild their homes as its own glorious responsibility, regards the hardships of the Korean people as its own hardships, and regards the happiness of the Korean people as its own happiness. "Helping the Korean people build Korea like we build our motherland" has become a consistent slogan for various units. They have universally demonstrated the highest enthusiasm in participating in the Korean people's recovery and reconstruction work, not only creating many deeds of completing engineering plans ahead of schedule or exceeding quotas, but also trying every means to overcome difficulties and saving materials and equipment for the Korean people. An engineering corps of our army participating in the Pyongyang reconstruction project manufactured 32 kinds of tools, a total of 1,122 pieces, from scrap iron in three months. When an engineering unit of our army was building a bridge in Pyongyang, it used shrapnel and scrap iron to make 40,360 bridge deck nails, which not only solved the difficulty of insufficient materials but also saved a lot of materials for the Korean people. The engineering corps of our army, which built the Daedong River pontoon bridge, launched an intense assault labor to complete the construction task 20 days ahead of schedule, and persisted in working until midnight for several consecutive days, and worked non-stop for two days and nights. In this way, under the tense and joyful labor of more than 200 people, the large pontoon bridge, 518 meters long and 9 meters wide, was successfully built in less than two months. In order to help the Korean people build the Xipu County People's Middle School, a unit of our army transported more than 1,000 pieces of timber from more than 30 miles away, crossing a 700-meter high mountain. In Giseong-ri, Changdo County, there was a canal that was destroyed by the enemy in 1950, and there were destroyed reservoirs in Dabae-ri and Bangyo-ri. Because the local people lacked labor, they were unable to repair them in the short term. After learning about the difficulties of the local people, a unit of our army immediately formed a canal repair team, and spent 20 days repairing the canal and reservoirs, so that the land that had been barren for more than three years was irrigated and turned into fertile land.

    The Korean people and their beloved leader, Marshal Kim Il-sung, often care for our army meticulously. This care encouraged our army to bravely fight and annihilate the enemy in the past, and today it encourages our army to actively participate in the Korean people's recovery and reconstruction work. Our army has continuously received banners, gifts, and various forms of warm condolences and congratulations from the Korean government and people for participating in the recovery and reconstruction work. When building the long dike of Aesan River, the Korean people near the construction site vacated their houses for the troops to live in, so that the troops could get enough rest, while they themselves slept in the kitchen. At various construction sites, Korean women and children often brought water from several miles away to quench the troops' thirst. Local governments and people often name the projects that our army helps build as "Volunteer Army" and "China-Korea Friendship" to express their eternal commemoration. All of this has greatly encouraged us.

    The huge scale and rapid progress of the Korean people's recovery and reconstruction work, as well as the spirit of selfless labor shown in this work, directly encourage our army to participate in this work with full confidence. The 1954-1956 three-year plan for the recovery and development of the national economy recently adopted by the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea shows the infinite power contained within the Korean people and the beautiful prospects for Korea's recovery and development. After the armistice, the Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and their beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, quickly began post-war recovery and reconstruction work, and achieved extremely brilliant achievements in all aspects in less than a year. The heroic city of Pyongyang, which the volunteer soldiers are most concerned about, is changing its wartime appearance day by day. Factories and mines one after another throughout Korea have been put into production, and the vivid deeds of labor models and production innovators are spread among the volunteer soldiers. All of this has promoted us to better and more fully help the Korean people in their recovery and reconstruction work.

    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army will continue to make greater efforts to help the Korean people in their recovery and reconstruction work. The Headquarters and Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army issued instructions in March of this year, calling on the entire army to universally carry out this work and allocating time for the troops to participate in this voluntary labor. Various units have universally formulated concrete plans to help the Korean people carry out recovery and reconstruction work and are continuing to work hard to realize these plans.

    The Korean people are actively carrying out peaceful post-war recovery and reconstruction work. However, in South Korea, American imperialism is supporting Syngman Rhee in actively expanding his army and preparing for war, clamoring for war, and stubbornly obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, undermining the sincere efforts made by China, North Korea, and the Soviet Union to seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. This cannot but make us more vigilant. Therefore, in commemorating the fourth anniversary of the "June 25th" Korean people's anti-aggression war, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is firmly watching the new conspiracies of American imperialism together with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, vigilantly guarding their positions, and are ready to crush any enemy attacks and sabotage activities at any time. At the same time, we are determined to continue our efforts to participate in the Korean people's post-war recovery and reconstruction work. We are determined to strive for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and for the further consolidation and development of the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples in these two aspects.

    Long live the close and united fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples!

    中国人民志愿军积极地参加朝鲜人民战后恢复和重建的工作
    ——为纪念朝鲜人民反侵略战争四周年而作
    中国人民志愿军副政治委员　李志民
    “六·二五”，这是朝鲜人民、中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民忘不了的一天。在四年前的今天，美帝国主义策动南朝鲜李承晚匪帮向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发动了武装进攻。朝鲜人民英勇地开始了为保卫自己的独立、自由的抗美战争。
    美帝国主义发动的对朝鲜人民的侵略战争，是一场空前野蛮、残酷的屠杀、掠夺和破坏。它使用了除原子弹以外的一切最新式的杀人武器和毁灭性的破坏手段。无数善良、勤劳的朝鲜人民惨死在美帝国主义的屠刀和炸弹下。无数用朝鲜人民历代的辛劳和智慧建筑起来的美丽的城市和乡村，也在美国侵略者的凝固汽油弹和重磅炸弹的毁灭下化成一片废墟。美帝国主义的野蛮侵略给朝鲜人民造成的巨大损失是无法估量的。美帝国主义以为这样就可以摧毁朝鲜人民的生存条件，并从而征服朝鲜人民反抗侵略的意志。但是，敌人这种打算完全错误而且可耻地失败了。英雄的朝鲜人民不但对敌人进行了无比英勇顽强的战斗，而且在同敌人艰苦作战中，就同时在敌人所造成的废墟上为保证战争的胜利、为未来的幸福生活而坚韧地进行着困难重重的恢复与重建工作了。朝鲜人民的这种努力，保证了共和国顺利度过了战争中最艰苦的日子，支援了朝、中人民军队取得了停战的胜利。在停战实现以后，朝鲜人民更加坚定而乐观地开始了规模巨大的、全面的恢复与重建工作，决心用自己勤劳的双手迅速医治战争创伤，重建美丽的家园。
    朝鲜人民的反侵略斗争不仅保卫了朝鲜的独立和自由，保卫了共和国北半部的民主基地，并且对于保卫中国人民建设事业、对于保卫远东与世界和平的神圣事业，作了巨大的贡献。
    肩负着抗美援朝光荣使命的中国人民志愿军，按照祖国人民的嘱托，和英雄的朝鲜人民军亲密团结，并肩作战，共同打败了美国侵略者，并且在战斗空隙中尽可能地帮助着朝鲜人民进行生产和恢复家园的工作。在那些艰苦的战争日子里，我们和朝鲜人民血汗流在一起，凝结成了两国人民牢不可破的战斗友谊，保证了反对共同敌人的胜利。
    今天在朝鲜人民开始了战后大规模恢复和重建工作的时候，中国人民志愿军看到了朝鲜人民的坚韧努力，看到了伟大的苏联和我们伟大祖国以及各兄弟国家对于朝鲜人民恢复重建事业的巨大援助，感到十分兴奋。中国人民志愿军在警惕地守卫着自己阵地的同时，积极地协助着朝鲜人民进行战后恢复与重建工作。在战争中胜利地保证了后方交通的我军铁道部队，在停战以后立即全力投入了帮助朝鲜人民恢复铁路的工作，三个月内即修复、修整和新建桥梁三百零八座，全长一万五千多公尺，并修复线路七千多公尺，车站三十七处，协助朝鲜铁路员工迅速地全部恢复了朝鲜北部原有铁路线。我军并以一部分工兵部队全力参加了若干城市交通和水利建设的工程，特别是还有一支工兵部队，光荣地参加了英雄城——平壤市的重建工作。各线守备部队则利用空隙在驻地附近帮助朝鲜人民兴修水利，恢复学校、医院、修建房舍以及帮助进行其他各种生产劳动。如驻在西海岸的我军某部帮助朝鲜人民修筑了艾山江的堤防，这条蜿蜒九千三百多公尺、积土二百四十八万多立方公尺的长堤，可使五百多公顷的土地受益，从而保障了每年五千吨粮食的收获量。某部在平安南道安州郡青松里帮助当地人民修筑了大桥川改变河道工程，共挖河道长约二千八百一十一公尺，出土十六万立方公尺，并修整了两岸五条水渠和三条河堤。这个地区河流改道后，可使五百公顷稻田免除水患，并能增加耕地面积十公顷，估计每年可增产粮食四百七十五吨。守卫在金城前线的某部在今年一月至四月份，就帮助驻地附近居民修筑水渠十四条，还帮助驻地居民修建民房五百七十八幢。据不完全统计，停战后我军各部队在驻地帮助朝鲜人民修建的中学和小学即有一百多所。在去年秋收时，各部队共帮助驻地朝鲜农民收获各种庄稼近一万公顷。今年春天，各部队又普遍帮助了驻地农民进行春耕播种工作。
    在伟大的国际主义教养下的中国人民志愿军，把帮助自己最亲密的战友——朝鲜人民重建家园当作自己光荣的责任，把朝鲜人民的艰苦看成是自己的艰苦，把朝鲜人民的幸福看成是自己的幸福。“要像建设祖国一样地来帮助朝鲜人民建设朝鲜”成了各部队一致的口号，他们在参加朝鲜人民的恢复与重建工作中普遍表现了最高的热情，不但创造了许多提前或超额完成工程计划的事迹，而且想尽各种办法克服困难，并为朝鲜人民节约物资器材。参加平壤重建工程的我军一支工兵部队在三个月中就利用废铁制造了三十二种工具，共一千一百二十二件。工兵某部在平壤架桥时，利用弹片废铁制成桥面钉四万零三百六十颗，既解决了材料不足的困难，又为朝鲜人民节省了不少物资。修建大同江便桥的我军工兵部队为了争取将修建任务提前二十天完工而展开了紧张的突击劳动，曾一连数日坚持工作到半夜，并有两天通宵地紧张工作。就这样，在二百多个人员的紧张愉快的劳动下，不到两个月的时间就将全长五百一十八公尺、宽九公尺的大便桥修建成功了。我军某部为了帮助朝鲜人民修建洗浦郡人民中学，战士们从三十里以外翻越七百公尺的高山搬运木材千多根。在昌道郡岐城里有一条在一九五零年即被敌人破坏的水渠，在大白里、板桥里各有一个被毁的贮水池，因为当地人民缺乏劳动力，在短期内无力修复，我军某部了解到当地人民的困难后，立即组成了修渠队，以二十天的时间把水渠和贮水池全部修复，使荒了三年多的土地得到灌溉而变成良田。
    朝鲜人民及其敬爱的领袖金日成元帅经常无微不至地关怀着我军。这种关怀在过去鼓舞了我军勇敢作战歼灭敌人，在今天又鼓舞了我军积极地参加朝鲜人民恢复和重建工作。我军在参加恢复重建工作中不断受到朝鲜政府和人民赠送锦旗、礼品以及各种形式的热烈慰问和祝贺。在修建艾山江长堤时，工地附近的朝鲜人民为了使我军修筑部队得到充足休息，就把房子腾出给部队住，自己却睡在灶房里。在各个工地上经常有朝鲜妇女、儿童从几里路以外送水给部队解渴。各地政府和人民常把我军帮助修建的工程以“志愿军”、“中朝友谊”等命名，表示永志纪念。这一切都极大地鼓舞了我们。
    朝鲜人民进行恢复和重建工作的巨大规模和迅速进展的情况以及在这一工作中表现的忘我劳动精神，更直接地鼓舞了我军满怀信心地参加这一工作。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁最近通过的一九五四——一九五六年人民经济恢复发展三年计划，显示了蕴藏在朝鲜人民内部的无限力量，显示了朝鲜恢复发展的美丽前景。停战以后，朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党及其敬爱的领袖金日成元帅领导下，迅速开始了战后恢复和重建工作，并且在不到一年的时间内就在各方面获得了极其辉煌的成就。志愿军战士最关怀的英雄城市——平壤市在日新月异地改变着战时的面貌。全朝鲜一个接着一个的工厂、矿山投入了生产，劳动模范和生产革新者的生动事迹传播在志愿军中，这一切都推动了我们更好地和更多地去帮助朝鲜人民恢复和重建的工作。
    中国人民志愿军还将继续以更大努力来帮助朝鲜人民进行恢复和重建的工作。中国人民志愿军司令部、政治部在今年三月间曾颁发了指示，号召全军普遍展开这一工作，并为部队参加这种义务劳动划出了时间。各个部队都普遍地制订了帮助朝鲜人民进行恢复与重建工作的具体计划，并正在继续为实现这些计划而努力。
    朝鲜人民正在积极地进行着战后的和平的恢复与重建工作。但是在南朝鲜，美帝国主义却在支持李承晚积极地扩军备战，叫嚣战争，在日内瓦会议上顽固地阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题，破坏朝、中、苏三国为谋求和平解决朝鲜问题而作的诚恳的努力。这就不能不使我们更加提高警惕。因此，在纪念“六·二五”朝鲜人民反侵略战争四周年的时候，中国人民志愿军坚定地与朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军一道严密注视着美帝国主义的新的阴谋，警惕地守卫着自己的阵地，随时准备粉碎敌人的任何袭击和破坏活动，同时决心继续努力，参加朝鲜人民战后恢复与重建的工作。我们决以这样两方面来为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，为更加巩固与发展朝中两国人民的战斗友谊而奋斗。
    朝中两国人民亲密团结的战斗友谊万岁！
