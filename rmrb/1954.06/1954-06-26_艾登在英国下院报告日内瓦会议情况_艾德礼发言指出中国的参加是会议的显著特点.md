Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: TASS, London, June 24th: Reuters broadcast the speech given by British Foreign Secretary Eden in the British House of Commons on June 23rd, when he presided over a debate on foreign policy issues.

In his speech, Eden first discussed the work of the Geneva Conference.

Eden emphasized the urgency of resolving the Indochina issue. He said, he has "rarely known a situation like this, in which everyone should have clearly seen the danger of the flames of war expanding."

Eden continued, "I must unhappily report that we have not made real progress in seeking a solution in the discussions on the Korean issue. It can only be said that we have clarified more clearly than ever before the real points of disagreement in principle between the opposing sides."

Eden then discussed the process of the Korean issue negotiations in Geneva and the differences between the two sides.

Eden said, "We have not reached an agreement on the issue of a unified Korea, but the suggestion to continue negotiations remains valid."

Eden emphasized: "The government's aim and view remain that the United Nations cannot expect to resolve the Korean issue without the consent of China and the two Koreas."

A portion of Eden's speech addressed the issue of the "Southeast Asia Security Organization."

When discussing the progress of the Indochina issue negotiations in Geneva, Eden mentioned the three committees established to discuss the military issues of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, which should submit their reports separately before July 10th.

Eden said, "Before we left, we reached an understanding among ourselves: once we receive the reports from the military representatives, we will immediately consult, and then make a decision on whether we will return to Geneva to complete the work of the conference. As for myself, I am prepared to return if doing so can contribute to peace."

Eden continued, "I would like to express my personal thanks to Molotov for his assistance in resolving procedural issues." Eden reminded that he and Molotov had taken turns serving as chairmen. "If we had not maintained extremely close contact, the conference simply could not have carried out its work."

Eden continued, "One result of the conference is the improvement of British-Chinese relations, and this has already produced some consequences, which the conference has already seen. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to meet with Mr. Zhou Enlai. The talks between the two delegations in Geneva were undoubtedly valuable.

In my opinion, these talks have proven beneficial to our country and truly helpful for peaceful coexistence, which remains the aim and purpose of our dealings with every country."

Eden then spoke about Prime Minister Churchill and Eden himself's upcoming visit to the United States.

Finally, Eden expressed his hope that a peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue "– if we can achieve it – will provide a basis for establishing security in Southeast Asia. Its role will extend far beyond this. It will greatly consolidate peace throughout the world."

Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: TASS, London, June 24th: According to the British News Agency, British Labour Party leader Attlee, in his speech in the House of Commons on June 23rd during a debate on foreign policy issues, pointed out Eden's efforts in Geneva and said, "I think it is quite clear that Molotov also made efforts to make the conference a success."

Attlee continued: "I think the most striking feature of the conference is that the real rulers of China participated in a conference in Europe for the first time. It is truly absurd not to recognize the current Chinese government as the recognized government of this country by now. In my view, the real obstacle to resolving the Korean issue is because China's status and China's inability to obtain its due place in the United Nations are not recognized until now."

Liberal Party leader Clement Davies said: "In order to seek peace, in order to seek peace along a wise path rather than through war, it is necessary: first, to have the Chinese government recognized by all countries, including the United States, and second, to give this government its due place in the United Nations."

Conservative Party member of Parliament, Roy Boothby, expressed doubt in his speech as to whether the United States truly hoped to achieve a peaceful resolution of any issue at the Geneva Conference.

    艾登在英国下院报告日内瓦会议情况
    艾德礼发言指出中国的参加是会议的显著特点
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十四日讯：路透社广播了英国外交大臣艾登六月二十三日在英国下议院主持外交政策问题辩论时的发言。
    艾登在发言中首先谈到日内瓦会议的工作。
    艾登强调指出了解决印度支那问题的迫切性。他说，他“以往很少知道这样的局势，在这种局势中，大家应当都已清楚地看到战火扩大的危险。”
    艾登接着说：“我必须不愉快地报告，我们在关于朝鲜问题的讨论中，在寻求解决办法方面并没有得到真正的进展。只能这样说：我们比以往更清楚地阐明了敌对双方之间原则上分歧的真正之点。”
    随后艾登谈到了在日内瓦举行的朝鲜问题谈判的过程和双方的分歧。
    艾登说：“我们没有就统一朝鲜问题达成协议，但是关于继续进行谈判的建议仍然是有效的。”
    艾登强调说：“政府的目的和观点仍然是：联合国不能指望在没有得到中国和两个朝鲜同意的情况下来解决朝鲜问题。”
    艾登的发言中有一部分谈到“东南亚安全组织”的问题。
    艾登谈到在日内瓦举行的印度支那问题谈判的进行情况时提到了为讨论越南、老挝和柬埔寨的军事问题而设立的三个委员会，它们应该在七月十日以前分别提出报告。
    艾登说：“在我们离开之前，我们之间已取得谅解：一旦接到军事代表的报告后，我们将立即进行会商，随后就我们回到日内瓦去完成会议工作问题作出决定。就我本人来说，我是准备回去的，如果我这样做能够对和平有所贡献的话。”
    艾登接着说：“我愿意对莫洛托夫在解决程序问题上的帮助向他表示我个人的谢意。”艾登提醒说，他曾和莫洛托夫轮流担任主席。“如果不是我们保持着极密切的联系，会议简直就不能进行它的工作。”
    艾登继续说：“会议的一个结果是英中关系的改善，而这已经产生了一些后果，这是会议所已经看到的。我很高兴有机会和周恩来先生会晤。两国代表团之间在日内瓦的会谈无疑是有价值的。
    据我的意见，这些会谈已证明有利于我国，并且真正有助于和平共处，而和平共处仍然是我们和每个国家交往方面的目的和宗旨。”
    艾登接着谈到了邱吉尔首相和艾登自己即将往访美国一事。
    最后艾登表示希望说，和平解决印度支那问题的协议“——如果我们能够取得的话——将为建立东南亚的安全提供一个基础。它的作用将远不限于此。它将大大地巩固全世界的和平。”
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社伦敦二十四日讯：据英国新闻联合社报道，英国反对党工党领袖艾德礼二十三日在下院辩论外交政策问题时的发言中，指出艾登在日内瓦所作的努力，并说：“我以为，十分明显，莫洛托夫也曾努力使会议获得成就。”
    艾德礼继续说：“我认为，会议最显著的特点是，中国的真正执政者第一次参加了在欧洲的会议。到现在还不承认目前的中国政府是这个国家的公认政府，那真是荒谬的事。照我看来，解决朝鲜问题的真正障碍，是由于直到现在不承认中国的地位和中国不能在联合国中获得应有的位置。”
    自由党领袖克莱门特·戴维斯说：“为了求得和平，为了循着明智的道路而不是借助于战争求得和平，必须：第一、要使中国政府获得包括美国在内的所有国家的承认，第二、使这个政府在联合国获得应有的位置。”
    保守党议员罗·布特比在发言中表示怀疑：美国是否真正希望在日内瓦会议上获致任何问题和平的解决。
