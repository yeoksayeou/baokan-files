    Chengdu Democratic Women's Federation pays close attention to adopting simple and convenient methods, using local materials to organize various street-level convenient childcare organizations. According to statistics from December of last year, the city had a total of four street-organized childcare groups and three production-nature organized childcare groups, with a total of thirty-one nursery workers, caring for three hundred and seventy infants and young children. Two-thirds of these were children of female workers and working women, and one-third were children of female teachers and independent laborers.

    In addition to the above relatively fixed childcare groups, temporary childcare stations are often organized to enable women to participate in various social activities. For example, during the general election, in order to hold election meetings successfully, methods such as relatives helping relatives and neighbors helping neighbors were used to organize two hundred and forty-five temporary infant stations and five hundred and thirteen temporary childcare stations, caring for a total of forty-one thousand eight hundred and twenty-four infants and young children, ensuring that more than ninety-five percent of female voters participated in the election. In order to allow women to attend classes with peace of mind, seventeen temporary childcare stations were organized in literacy classes. The city's three existing cinemas have also organized temporary childcare groups to care for children under one meter in height (because many theaters in the city stipulate that children under one meter in height are not allowed to enter), so that mothers can watch movies.

    成都民主妇联举办各种街道简便托儿组织
    成都市民主妇女联合会很注意采用因陋就简、就地取材的办法，举办多种多样的街道简便托儿组织。据去年十二月份的统计，全市共有四个按街道组织的托儿组，三个按生产性质组织的托儿组，共有保育员三十一人，收托婴幼儿三百七十人。其中三分之二是女工、劳动妇女的孩子，三分之一是女教职员和独立劳动者的孩子。
    除了以上比较固定的托儿组外，为了使妇女能参加各种社会活动，还经常组织临时托儿站。像在普选中，为了开好选举大会，就采用亲帮亲邻帮邻等办法，组织了二百四十五个临时婴儿站，五百一十三个临时托儿站，共收托婴幼儿四万一千八百二十四名，保证了百分之九十五以上的女选民参加了选举。为了让妇女安心上课，在识字班中，曾组织了十七个临时托儿站。全市现有三个电影院还组织了临时托儿组，收托不满一公尺的孩子（因该市许多影剧院规定不满一公尺的孩子不能入场），好让妈妈们看电影。（刘　衡）
