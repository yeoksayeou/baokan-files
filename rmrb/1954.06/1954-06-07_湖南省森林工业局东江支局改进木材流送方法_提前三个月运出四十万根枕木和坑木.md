    Dongjiang Branch of Hunan Provincial Forestry Bureau Improves Timber Floating Method
    400,000 Sleepers and Pit Props Shipped Three Months Ahead of Schedule
    The Dongjiang Branch of the Hunan Provincial Forestry Bureau shipped 400,000 timbers three months ahead of schedule and saved the state over 1.2 billion yuan in labor and material costs.
    The Dongjiang Branch has five major forest areas under its jurisdiction, producing a large number of pit props, sleepers, and fir strips every year to support industrial, mining, and transportation construction in various regions. In the past, the transportation of these timbers always used the old method—tying fir strips into a bottom raft to load sleepers and pit props, and floating them downstream when the water was high. This year, the Dongjiang Branch produced a lot of sleepers and pit props, but very few fir strips, not enough to make rafts, and the river water level fluctuated from time to time. If the old method was used for transportation, it would not be possible to ship them out until the third quarter. The entire staff of the Dongjiang Branch jointly studied the problem and finally decided to directly push the sleepers and pit props into the water for segmented floating. In order to ensure the safe arrival of the timber at its destination, twenty-one river-blocking ropes were erected along the more than one hundred li route, and three insurance rafts were set up to ensure that no accidents occurred during the journey. At present, all 400,000 sleepers and pit props have been transported out, about three months ahead of the old method, and have been supplied to various regions in a timely manner. At the same time, it saved 1.26 billion yuan more than using fir to make bottom rafts. (Wan Shanqing)

    湖南省森林工业局东江支局改进木材流送方法
    提前三个月运出四十万根枕木和坑木
    湖南森林工业局东江支局提前三个月运出四十万根木材，还为国家节约了工、料费十二亿余元。
    东江支局辖区内共有五个主要林区，每年出产很多坑木、枕木和杉条，支援各地工矿和交通建设。这些木材的运输，过去一直是沿用着老办法——把杉条扎成底排装载枕木和坑木，等水大时流送。今年东江支局生产的枕木、坑木很多，杉条很少，不够扎排，且河溪水位时涨时落，若用老办法运输，要到第三季度才能运出。东江支局全体职工共同研究，最后决定直接将枕木、坑木推到水里分段漂送。为了保证木材安全到达目的地，在一百多里的途程中，架了二十一道拦河索，并设置了三个保险排，保证了中途不出事故。目前四十万根枕木和坑木已全部运送出来，比用老办法约提前了三个月，及时供应了各地需要。同时，比用杉木扎底排要节省工、料费十二亿六千多万元。（万山青）
