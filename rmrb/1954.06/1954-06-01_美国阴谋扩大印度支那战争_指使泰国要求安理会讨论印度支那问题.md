Xinhua News Agency, May 31st: Under the direction of the United States, the Deputy Permanent Representative of Thailand to the United Nations, Thanat Khoman, formally requested on the 29th that the United Nations Security Council convene a special meeting to discuss the Indochina issue and dispatch an "observer group" to Indochina, with the mission of providing a so-called "objective" report on the local situation. Khoman's action was taken under the intensified instigation of the United States, with the aim of undermining the Geneva Conference and using the United Nations to expand the Indochina War. Reports indicate that before taking this step, Khoman had held intense consultations with the US Representative to the United Nations and representatives of other countries. After he made the request, the US Representative to the United Nations, Lodge, immediately "assured" Khoman that the United States would "support" this request in the Security Council.

News from Bangkok indicates that the Thai authorities are very interested in the United Nations, manipulated by the United States, creating a second Korean War in Indochina. According to a report by the United Press on the 30th, a spokesperson for the Thai government, Lieutenant General Kabol Chongkading, stated that as long as the United Nations makes a "resolution," Thailand will send troops to participate in the intervention in the Indochina War.

    美国阴谋扩大印度支那战争
    指使泰国要求安理会讨论印度支那问题
    【新华社三十一日讯】在美国导演下，泰国驻联合国常驻副代表塔纳特·科曼二十九日正式要求联合国安全理事会召开特别会议讨论印度支那问题，并派遣“观察团”前往印度支那，任务是就当地局势提出一份所谓“客观的”报告。科曼这一行动是在美国的加紧策动下采取的，目的在于破坏日内瓦会议和利用联合国来扩大印度支那战争。消息表明，科曼在采取这一步骤以前，曾和美国驻联合国代表以及其他国家代表进行紧张的磋商，在他提出这一要求之后，美国驻联合国代表洛奇立即向科曼“保证”美国将在安全理事会中“支持”这一要求。
    来自曼谷的消息表明：泰国当局对于由美国操纵下的联合国来在印度支那制造第二个朝鲜战争一事感到很大兴趣。据合众社三十日报道，泰国政府的一位发言人甲军冲中将表示，只要联合国作出“决议”，泰国就会派遣军队去参加干涉印度支那战争。
