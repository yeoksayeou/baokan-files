Heated Nonsense
Zhuang Nong

A labor model conference with over five hundred participants has been going on for four full days. It’s gradually getting dark, and everything that needed to be done has been done according to plan. Only the closing ceremony is left on the agenda, and there are only a little over ten minutes left until the scheduled closing time.

The chairman announced, "The conference is about to victoriously close..." People's spirits perked up suddenly, and they prepared to be dismissed.

However, the chairman cleverly followed up the phrase "is about to victoriously close" with the announcement, "Now, let's invite Deputy Secretary Mou to deliver the closing speech."

Under the colorful neon lights, a tall figure appeared behind the amplifier.

"Ah, it's that old brother; he'll torment you for at least two hours," someone whispered from the audience.

The closing speech began with enthusiastic words: "I... warmly congratulate... extend my highest respect... wish the labor models even greater victories." The speaker paused here based on habitual experience. The moment congratulations, respect, and victory were mentioned... it was as if someone had pressed a button, and the audience burst into applause. Deputy Secretary Mou smiled, immersed in the joy of the applause.

"I will now offer a few points on the following issues." After the applause, Deputy Secretary Mou moved on to the main topic.

"My goodness, he's still going to talk about several issues!" a woman's soft cry came from behind.

"Our conference has victoriously concluded; the victory of the conference is certain." Deputy Secretary Mou continued triumphantly, "The victory of the conference is mainly manifested in the following aspects: Firstly, everyone listened to the reports from Manager Liu and Vice Chairman Kang..."

"Secondly, this conference has great significance, which is of great help to ensure the completion of tasks..."

"Thirdly, it helped to improve leadership..."

"Finally, valuable experiences were exchanged. What are the benefits of this? The effect is very significant..."

"Therefore, this conference is a victorious conference, and overall, it is a very, very victorious conference."

At this point, many people in the audience began to whisper:

"Why is he just repeating this? Didn't Secretary Gu already explain it in detail in the conference summary? Why doesn't he talk about something new?"

"He just said valuable experiences were exchanged, but what kind of experience is valuable, and why is it valuable? He didn't even say a word about it?"

"How could he say anything new? He can talk nonsense for hours, but he can't talk about anything new for even five minutes."

More than half an hour had passed, and many in the audience began to show signs of weariness. Some were observing the faces of the members of the presidium; others, due to fatigue, leaned back in their chairs with one hand on their hips, frowning; some were drawing various strange shapes in their notebooks. One person drew the back view of a flute player in the orchestra, and because he drew a bald spot on the back of his head, it attracted many people to pass it around. The chairmen of the presidium were all embarrassed and hung their heads. The executive chairman of the conference, standing in front of the amplifier, helplessly retreated slowly to his seat and stared at his shoelaces.

Only Deputy Secretary Mou, enjoying himself in the rolling waves of nonsense, didn't notice anything and continued to circle happily in the vortex of nonsense.

"The second issue I want to talk about, comrades, is that the conference is about to end. Everyone knows that the conference is about to close. What I am saying now is called a closing speech..." *Hee hee hee hee...* A sparse burst of cold laughter.

The incoherent nonsense flowed on and on. Someone opened the window, letting the wind blow in the drizzle to clear their dizzy heads. From the back came a limerick written on white paper: "A small gauze lamp hangs in the room, flickering and shining brightly. The leader on the stage talks too much nonsense, and the audience's buttocks ache under the lamp." Those accustomed to enjoying blessings were already "seeing the Duke of Zhou" in their chairs. A blunt young man, glaring directly at the stage, said angrily, "There should be a rule: anyone who talks nonsense should be locked up for two hours."

"The fourth point, comrades," Deputy Secretary Mou raised the volume of his speech. Obviously, because the audience had not applauded at what he considered to be brilliant points, he had noticed something. So, he employed a little trick. "Labor models and advanced producers should continue to advance, constantly advance, and maintain glory and promote glory. You must know that victory plus victory can increase even greater glory. I believe you are willing to do so. But I am not you; I want to ask you," he leaned towards the audience, "Please answer: are you willing or not? Do you have the determination or not?"

"Willing!" "Yes!" The labor models, of course, would not remain silent on this issue and immediately gave an affirmative answer.

Deputy Secretary Mou was extremely excited; he screamed desperately, causing the entire presidium to tremble: "Good! Excellent! You have the determination! We must win! You must win! You must advance! Comrades! Advance!!"

"The leader's voice is going to break!" one listener said in surprise.

"My head is going to explode," said a person whose face was flushed from the long meeting, and whose nostrils were even blocked, holding his head in both hands in dissatisfaction.

The climax had arrived, and the conference should have closed immediately. The chairman also ran to the microphone, preparing to announce "the victorious closing of the conference."

"The third issue I want to talk about is a few requirements for our representatives." But Deputy Secretary Mou continued to speak. The chairman had no choice but to return to his original seat in boredom.

"Firstly... Secondly... Finally, some of those who attended the conference are not labor models. What should we do? As people say, one master, one apprentice. We are all one master; we are all led by the Communist Party. Zhang San, Li Si, and even I, are all led by the Communist Party. We all read the same book, graduated from the same school, all studied Marxist-Leninist books, and were all taught by the same teacher..." *Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk...* Another even more obvious burst of cold laughter.

"Thirdly, we should carry out persuasive education on conservative views and conduct friendly criticism... There is also the issue of establishing a grassroots responsibility system... The issue of discussing work plans..."

I flexed my fingers, which were sore from taking notes, and all I could hear was a buzzing in my ears. "Big one," "Small one," "Firstly," "Secondly," were completely out of order. Finally, I sighed deeply, closed my notebook, and stared blankly at this leader.

The conference was finally declared victoriously closed in the chairman's hurried voice.

People crowded in a narrow aisle to get to the dining hall. The cold, damp wind swept across people's faces from time to time, blowing away almost all the messy nonsense that had filled their ears, and people felt lighter, but also felt a strange emptiness.

"Does he know that what he says is all nonsense?" a young comrade walking beside me asked me. I glanced at him and replied, "If he were to evaluate it himself, he would estimate this speech as 'having played a decisive guiding role.'"

"He really knows how to speak. Look how energetic his gestures are! In the most enthusiastic parts, he seems to be risking his life, not caring about anything," said a lively girl with pigtails.

"Yes! It's really not easy to wave your hands and give a speech for two hours without long-term 'training'," replied a male comrade walking shoulder to shoulder with her.

A short, fat man with a dark complexion directly criticized, "With such strength, it would be much better to study the problems in the work than to talk nonsense."

Deputy Secretary Mou may have slept very sweetly that night. My dear comrade, when will you abandon complacency, humbly learn, and talk less nonsense?

### 热烈的废话

    热烈的废话
    庄农
    有五百多人参加的劳动模范大会已整整进行了四天。天渐渐地黑下来，一切应办的事都已按部就班的办完，议程单上只剩下了闭幕一项，离应该闭幕的时间只剩十几分钟了。
    主席宣布说：“大会就要胜利闭幕了…”人们的精神猛然振作起来，准备散会。
    但是，主席紧接着“要胜利闭幕了”这句话之后却巧妙地宣布：“现在请牟副书记给我们致闭幕辞”。
    彩色的霓虹灯光下，扩音器后出现了一个高大的人形。
    “唉，原来是这位老兄，他最少也要折磨你两个钟头。”台下有人轻声地说。
    闭幕辞一开头就是热烈的：“我……热烈的祝贺……致崇高的敬意……预祝劳动模范们更大的胜利。”演说者根据习惯的经验，在这里停顿了一下。一提到祝贺、敬意、胜利……便像有人按动了电钮，听众就哗哗地鼓起掌来。牟副书记浸沉在掌声的快乐中微笑。
    “我就以下几个问题再讲几点意见”。掌声之后，牟副书记转入了正题。
    “妈呀，他还要讲几个问题呢！”从背后传来一个女人的轻轻的叫声。
    “我们的大会胜利地结束了，大会的胜利是肯定的。”牟副书记洋洋得意地讲下去：“大会的胜利主要表现在以下几个方面：首先大家听了刘经理、康副主席的报告……
    “其次，这次大会有很重大的意义，这对保证完成任务有很大作用……
      “再次，帮助改进了领导……
      “最后，交流了宝贵经验。这有什么好处呢？这作用是很大的……
    所以说这个大会是胜利的大会，总的看来是很胜利很胜利的大会。”
    这时，听众当中有不少的人开始低声议论了：
      “为什么尽说些这个，刚才顾书记不是在大会总结中讲的很详细了吗？他为什么不讲点新的东西呢？”
      “刚才他说交流了宝贵经验，究竟那种经验是宝贵的，为什么宝贵，他连一点也没说呀？”
      “他那能讲出新东西来？要他讲空话可以讲上几个钟头，要他讲新东西他连五分钟也讲不了。”
    时间已过去了半点多钟，听众中开始有人表现出厌倦的心情。有的人在观察各位主席团委员的面貌；有的人由于疲劳，就单手插腰倾靠在椅背上皱着眉头；有些人在笔记本子上画着各种奇形怪状的画。有一个人描绘了演奏队一位吹横笛队员的背影，由于画出了他后头顶一块没头发的头皮，便引得许多人争相传阅。主席团各位主席都难为情地扎下了头，站在扩音器前的大会执行主席，无可奈何地慢慢退回到座位上去，低头看着自己的鞋尖。
    只有牟副书记，由于正在翻滚的废话浪涛里游得起兴，连一点什么也没觉察出来，仍然在快乐的废话漩涡里打着圈子。
    “我要说的第二个问题，同志们，大会就要结束了。大家知道，大会要闭幕了，我现在讲的话，叫作闭幕辞……”嘻嘻嘻嘻……一阵稀稀落落的冷笑声。
    语无伦次的废话滔滔不绝，有人把窗子打开，让风把细雨吹进来，清醒一下发昏的脑袋。后面传递来了一首写在白纸上的打油诗：“室内挂着小纱灯，忽闪闪的放光明，首长台上废话多，听众灯下屁股疼。”惯于纳福的人，已在椅子上“梦见周公”了。一个愣小伙子，怒目直视台上，发恨说：“应该规定一条纪律：说废话的人一律禁闭两小时。”
    “第四点，同志们”，牟副书记提高了演说的声音。显然由于听众没有在他认为精彩的地方鼓掌，使他觉察到了一些什么，于是他施展了一点小小的技巧。“劳动模范先进生产者，应当是继续的前进，不断的前进，要保持光荣、发扬光荣。要知道胜利加胜利，才能增加更大的光荣。我相信你们愿意这样做。但我不是你们，我愿问一问你们，”他探身向着台下：“请你们回答：愿意不愿意，有决心没有？”
    “愿意！”“有！”劳动模范们对于这个问题当然不会缄默，立即给以肯定的回答。
    牟副书记兴奋得不行了，他拚命地嘶喊，使整个主席台都颤动了：“好哇！好极啦！有决心！我们要胜利！你们要胜利！要前进！同志们！前进吧！！”
      “首长的嗓子要破了！”一位听众吃惊地说。
      “我的脑袋也要炸了。”一位因开会过久，满脸涨红，连鼻孔都发生了阻塞的人，双手挟着脑袋不满地说。
    高潮的顶点到了，照理应该马上闭幕了。主席也跑到麦克风前，准备宣布“大会胜利闭幕”了。
    “我要说的第三个问题：是对我们代表的几点要求。”牟副书记却继续讲下去。主席只好无趣地转回原座位去。
      “首先……其次……最后，参加大会的有些还不是劳动模范，该怎么办呢？人家说：一个师傅一个传授。咱们都是一个师傅，咱们都是共产党领导的，张三李四连我在内都是共产党领导的。咱们都是念的一本书，一个学校毕业的，都是念的马克思列宁主义书本，都是一个先生教的……”嗤、嗤、嗤、嗤……又一阵更为明显的冷笑。
      “第三，应该向保守观点进行说服教育，进行友谊的批判………还有关于建立基层责任制的问题………关于讨论作业计划的问题………”
    我扳动着记笔记累得生疼的手指，耳朵边只听得嗡嗡乱响，“大壹”“小一”“首先”“其次”，完全排列不起次序来了。终于长叹一声，收起了笔记本子，凝望着这位首长发呆。
    大会终于在主席匆促的声音中宣告胜利闭幕了。
    人们在一个窄窄的过道里拥挤着，要走到会餐的大厅去。冰冷潮湿的风不时在人们脸上掠过，把刚才装满耳朵的乱七八糟的废话，差不多吹光了，人们连身体也觉得轻松些，但同时也感到一种异样的空虚。
      “他知不知道他说的尽是废话？”走在我身边的一个小同志问我。我看了他一眼，回答说：“如果让他自己来评定一下，他会把这段讲话估计为
  ‘起了决定性指导作用’的。”
    “他真会讲话，你看他手势多有劲啊！在最热烈的地方，他像是拚出性命一切都不顾了。”一个梳双辫的活泼的姑娘说。
    “是啊！甩着两手上台，指手划脚地讲上两个钟头，不经长期‘锻炼’也真不容易。”和她并肩走着的一个男同志回答。
    一个黑脸膛的矮胖子直接了当地批评说：“有了这样的力气，多去钻研学习一下工作中的问题，会比说废话强的多。”
    牟副书记当夜也许睡得很甜美。我亲爱的同志，你什么时候才能弃掉自满，虚心学习而少说废话呢？
