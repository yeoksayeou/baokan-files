    With the continuous westward extension of the Kangzang Highway, the Bomi area, known for its warm climate and abundant products, is presenting a new scene everywhere. In the primeval forests and river valleys, construction workers have already built dozens of neat houses. In some villages, the new houses have greatly exceeded the total area of the old houses. When the Tibetan people who participated in supporting the road construction work returned to their hometowns a few months ago, they felt that the villages where they had lived for many years had changed their appearance.
    On the main transportation lines, flat roads are replacing winding mountain paths and single-log ladders. Suspension cables have been replaced by sturdy bridges. The yak, which used to be the main means of transportation for people, has also been replaced by automobiles. The traffic situation of "crossing a river is like crossing a mountain" is also beginning to change. In a certain section of the Bomi River, there are two villages on the east and west banks. People living on both sides of the river can see the houses of their relatives and friends on the opposite bank, but every year from the beginning of summer to the end of autumn, due to the rising river water, people need to travel more than a hundred miles to reach the opposite bank. Now with the bridge, people can walk to the other side in just a few minutes. In the past, it took at least eighteen days for people to transport goods from Qamdo to Bomi. Now, it takes only three days to complete the journey by car, and the freight is also greatly reduced compared to the past.
    Bustling small markets have appeared along the highway. Large trucks of the state-owned transportation company carrying tea and cloth are driving into the Bomi area. Tibetan and Han merchants from various places continue to arrive with various goods, and Tibetan people also carry green vegetables and firewood to these new markets for transactions.

    波密地区的新景象
    气候温暖物产丰富的波密地区，随着康藏公路不断向西伸延，到处呈现着新的景象。在原始森林里、在河谷里，建筑工人们已盖好了几十幢整齐的房屋。有些村子里，新房屋已大大超过了旧房舍的总面积。几个月前参加支援筑路工作的藏族人民回到家乡时，感到他们住了多年的村子已经改变了面貌。
    在主要交通线上，平坦的公路正代替着盘山险道和独木梯。溜索已改换为坚固的桥梁。过去为人们运输物资的主要工具——牦牛，也由汽车代替了。“隔河如隔山”的交通情况也开始在改变着。波堆河某段东西两岸有两个村庄，住在两岸的人隔河可以看见对岸亲友的房屋，但每年从夏初到秋末，由于河水上涨，人们需要绕一百多里才能到对岸。现在有了桥，只要几分钟时间人们就可以走到对岸去。过去人们从昌都往波密运一次货，至少要走十八天。现在坐上汽车三天就可以走完这段路程，运费也比过去大大降低了。
    公路沿线已经出现了热闹的小市场。国营运输公司的大卡车载着茶叶、布匹驶进波密地区。各地的藏、汉族商人不断带着各种货物到来，藏民们也背着青菜和烧柴到这些新市场上进行交易。　（新华社）
