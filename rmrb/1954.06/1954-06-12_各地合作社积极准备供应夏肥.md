Cooperatives in Various Regions Actively Prepare to Supply Summer Fertilizer

The summer hoeing and planting season in rural areas is approaching, and fertilizer supply work is about to enter a tense stage. According to the pattern of fertilizer supply in previous years, the amount of commercial fertilizer supplied is generally the largest in summer. Last year, the supply and marketing cooperatives in eighteen provinces, including Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Liaodong, sold approximately 30% to 40% of their total annual supply of fertilizer during this period. At present, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions are stepping up preparations for the summer fertilizer supply.

According to incomplete statistics, by the end of April, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in the North China region had prepared more than 103,000 tons of various summer fertilizers for farmers, and at the same time, prepared more than 41 million jin of various oilseed cake raw materials, which are currently being processed. In the Central South region, Hubei and Hunan provinces alone had grasped more than 91,000 tons of various oilseed cakes, more than 5,000 tons of chemical fertilizers and bone meal, and more than 798,000 dan of miscellaneous fertilizers by early May. As of April, the entire East China region had a stock of more than 430,000 tons of various fertilizers, in addition to a batch of oilseed cake raw materials. Now, many regions have lowered fertilizers to grassroots retail outlets. Fertilizers transferred to grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in Hunan Province account for more than 85% of the total fertilizer stock of cooperatives at all levels in the province; fertilizers transferred to grassroots cooperatives in Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces also account for about 60% to 80%.

In order to solve the problem of insufficient commercial fertilizer, supply and marketing cooperatives in many regions have paid attention to the management of local fertilizers. The various miscellaneous fertilizers grasped by supply and marketing cooperatives in the North China region this year are more than three times the actual sales volume of the entire year last year. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Zhejiang Province manage more than 40 kinds of miscellaneous fertilizers. The amount of miscellaneous fertilizers managed by the Haining County Cooperative Federation in the province this year will increase four times compared to last year. In Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hebei, Tianjin and other provinces and cities, supply and marketing cooperatives in many regions manage miscellaneous fertilizers such as manure, sludge, garbage, bones, and sauce residue. When supplying fertilizers, supply and marketing cooperatives in many regions are prepared to adopt a method of supplying with emphasis and control, and at the same time, further mobilize farmers to first use oilseed cake to feed pigs, in order to maximize the role of fertilizer.

    各地合作社积极准备供应夏肥
    农村夏锄夏种季节就要到来，肥料供应工作即将进入紧张阶段。按照往年供应肥料的规律，一般地区在夏季供应商品肥料的数量最多。去年山西、山东、江苏、河南、广东、四川、辽东等十八个省的供销合作社在这个期间销售的肥料，占全年供应总量的百分之三十到百分之四十左右。目前，各地供销合作社正加紧进行夏季供应肥料的准备工作。
    据不完全统计，华北区各级供销合作社到四月底止，就为农民准备好了各种夏季肥料十万三千多吨，同时准备了各种油饼原料四千一百多万斤，现正组织加工中。中南区仅湖北、湖南两省，到五月上旬已掌握各种饼肥九万一千多吨，化学肥料和骨粉五千多吨，杂肥七十九万八千多担。华东全区截至四月份止，库存的各种肥料已有四十三万余吨，另外还有一批饼肥原料。现在，许多地区已将肥料下调到基层零售点。湖南省已调到基层供销合作社的肥料，占全省各级合作社现有肥料总数的百分之八十五以上；河北、山西、山东、浙江、江苏、安徽等省调到基层合作社的肥料，也在百分之六十到百分之八十左右。
    为了解决商品肥料不足的问题，不少地区的供销合作社注意经营了地方肥料。华北全区供销合作社今年已掌握的各种杂肥，相当于去年全年实销数的三倍多。浙江省供销合作社经营的杂肥有四十多种，该省海宁县合作社联合社今年经营杂肥的数量，将比去年增加四倍。江苏、浙江、广东、河北、天津等省、市有不少地区的供销合作社经营大粪、污泥、垃圾、骨头、酱渣等杂肥。在供应肥料时，许多地区的供销合作社准备采用有重点、有控制地进行供应的办法，同时将进一步动员农民首先用饼肥喂猪，以尽量发挥肥料的作用。
