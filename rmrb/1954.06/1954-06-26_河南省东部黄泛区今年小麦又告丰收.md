The Yellow River flood area in eastern Henan Province, which was a wilderness only six or seven years ago, has seen another bumper wheat harvest this year thanks to the vigorous management by farmers under the leadership of the People's Government. Xihua and Fugou counties, in the heart of the Yellow River flood area, produced more than 230 million catties of wheat, an increase of 52.49 percent over the total output of the two counties last year. Farmers in the two counties are about to hand over more than 100 million catties of summer grain to the state as agricultural tax and sales.

During the busy wheat harvest season, golden wheat stacks are piled up everywhere around the villages covered with green willows in the Yellow River flood area. This scene appears not only on the fertile plains, but also on both banks of the Ying River and in the low-lying reconstruction ditch area, which used to be frequently flooded.

After the establishment of the People's Governments in various parts of the Yellow River flood area in 1947, they led the farmers in a huge recovery and construction effort. In less than three years, the weeds in this wasteland were removed, and the wasteland was reclaimed. Various localities also launched projects such as river management, canal excavation, and the construction of shelterbelt networks. Xihua County alone has successively dredged more than 30 large and small rivers and ditches, with a total length of more than 540 li. The reconstruction ditch has been excavated three times, and the Ying River has been dredged six times. After the completion of the project, more than 500,000 mu of farmland along the Ying River and the reconstruction ditch were freed from flooding. The shelterbelt network built along the more than 100-li sandy wasteland along the Jialu River has also turned a lot of sandy wasteland into farmland. At the same time, various localities actively carried out the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, promoted fine seeds, improved farming techniques, and successively issued more than 10 billion yuan in agricultural production loans. Therefore, the yield per unit area of ​​land quickly increased from 30 to 40 catties per year to more than 300 catties, and the highest reached more than 700 catties. The Yellow River flood area has become a wheat-producing "granary." (Xinhua News Agency)

    河南省东部黄泛区今年小麦又告丰收
    六、七年前还是一片荒原的河南省东部的黄泛区，在人民政府领导农民大力经营后，今年小麦又告丰收。黄泛区的腹心地区——西华、扶沟两县共产小麦二亿三千多万斤，比去年两县的总产量增加了百分之五十二点四九。两县农民即将缴纳的夏季公粮和卖给国家的小麦约在一亿斤以上。
    在麦收紧张的日子里，黄泛区绿柳覆盖的村庄周围，到处堆起了金黄的麦垛。这种景象，出现在平壤沃野之上，也出现在从前时常泛滥的颍河两岸和低洼的重建沟一带。
    一九四七年黄泛区各地人民政府建立后，即领导农民进行了巨大的恢复建设工作。不到三年，这块荒原地区的蒿草除去了，荒地也开垦完毕。各地还展开了治河、开渠和营造防护林网等工程。仅西华一县就先后挖疏大小河流、沟渠三十多条，总长五百四十多里。其中重建沟曾经三次开挖，颍河经过六次疏浚。工程完成后，颍河和重建沟沿岸五十多万亩农田根绝了水患。在贾鲁河沿岸百余里沙荒地带营造的防护林网，也使不少沙荒变成了农田。同时各地积极开展农业生产互助合作运动，推广优良种籽，改进耕作技术，并先后发放农业生产贷款一百数十亿元。因此土地的单位面积产量很快地由年产三四十斤增加到三百多斤，最高的达到七百多斤。黄泛区变成了盛产小麦的“粮仓”。（新华社）
