Xinhua News Agency, June 5th: The preparatory committee for the Beijing Handicraft Production Cooperative United General Cooperative convened the first meeting of the first representative assembly of cooperative members of the city's handicraft production cooperatives on June 4th and 5th. The assembly was attended by representatives from 187 units, including Beijing Handicraft Production Cooperatives, Handicraft Supply and Marketing Production Cooperatives, and Handicraft Supply and Marketing Production Groups, as well as over 600 guests from various agencies, including the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions. The assembly reviewed and summarized the past work of the handicraft production cooperatives, formulated a work plan for 1954, adopted the charter of the Beijing Handicraft Production Cooperative United General Cooperative, and elected the board of directors and supervisors, establishing the Beijing Handicraft Production Cooperative United General Cooperative. The assembly approved the membership of 174 cooperatives, including handicraft production cooperatives, handicraft supply and marketing production cooperatives, and handicraft supply and marketing production groups, into the city's United General Cooperative. The assembly also studied the issues of improving leadership and consolidating and improving existing handicraft production cooperatives in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism.

In recent years, Beijing's handicraft production cooperatives have developed considerably. As of the end of April this year, the city already had 179 handicraft production cooperatives, 7 handicraft supply and marketing production cooperatives, and 14 handicraft supply and marketing production groups, with more than 16,900 members, accounting for approximately 20% of the city's individual handicraft practitioners. In 1953, the total industrial output value of handicraft production cooperatives reached 260 billion yuan, accounting for approximately 25% of the city's total individual handicraft output value in the same year. The organized handicraftsmen produced more and more products, supplying the production and living needs of urban and rural people.

The assembly believed that supply and marketing production cooperatives and supply and marketing production groups should be organized in a planned and active manner, starting with supply and marketing, and that existing production cooperatives should be well-managed, and new production cooperatives should be steadily developed. The assembly proposed that the number of new members developed in 1954 should increase by 98% compared to 1953; the total annual output value should increase by 150% compared to 1953.

Regarding existing production cooperatives, the assembly pointed out that it is necessary to improve labor organization, strengthen technical guidance, and strictly implement the production responsibility system based on different situations. It is also necessary to strengthen planning management, implement economic accounting, consolidate labor discipline, and carry out labor competitions. In addition, it is necessary to convene member assemblies regularly to strengthen democratic management and political and ideological education.

The assembly pointed out that the establishment of the Beijing Handicraft Production Cooperative United General Cooperative marks a new stage in the implementation of democratic cooperative construction; it will be of great significance in promoting democracy and further mobilizing the enthusiasm of cooperative members and grassroots production cooperatives.

During the assembly, Deng Jie, Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, delivered a speech. Soviet expert Zhinobisev introduced the work experience of the Soviet Arts and Crafts Production Cooperative Union and put forward specific and valuable opinions on the work of the Beijing Handicraft Production Cooperative United General Cooperative.
