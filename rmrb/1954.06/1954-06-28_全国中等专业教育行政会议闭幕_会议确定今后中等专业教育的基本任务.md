The National Secondary Specialized Education Administrative Conference, convened by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, concluded on the 17th.

The conference summarized the adjustment, rectification, and reform work of secondary specialized education since liberation. Based on the general tasks of the state during the transition period and the basic tasks of the first Five-Year Plan, as well as the national guidelines for cultural and educational work, the conference defined the basic tasks of secondary specialized education for the future as: to cultivate, in a planned way, secondary specialized cadres with a foundation in Marxism-Leninism and the necessary general education and basic technical knowledge, mastering a specific profession, being physically healthy, and wholeheartedly serving socialist construction, in order to meet the needs of national construction. The guiding principle for future work is: vigorously rectify and develop secondary specialized education, strive to learn from advanced Soviet experience, actively promote teaching reform, and improve teaching quality. To this end, the current focus should be on clarifying leadership relationships, ending the adjustment work as soon as possible, and requiring relevant departments to guarantee the supply of teaching plans, syllabuses, textbooks, teaching reference books, teaching aids, and various rules and regulations for organizing teaching work to schools, so that schools can cultivate cadres in quantity and quality that can quickly meet the needs of national economic development.

According to the instructions of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government, the conference discussed the leadership relationships of secondary specialized schools and reached a consensus. The responsibility of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government is to provide unified guidance in secondary specialized education work. All types of schools are under the supervision of the respective functional departments. The central functional departments should implement centralized and unified direct leadership over secondary specialized schools, overcoming the chaotic phenomena of multiple leadership and lack of responsibility. According to this principle, the management methods are divided into two types: one is direct management by the central functional departments, and the other is management by provincial and municipal functional units under the unified leadership of the central functional departments. The education departments and bureaus of provincial and municipal people's governments have the responsibility to assist schools in certain tasks. The conference also suggested that the central functional departments pay attention to strengthening the education divisions. The conference also made arrangements for the specific measures and steps to realize this principle, pointing out that a positive attitude should be adopted to realize this new principle step by step. Close contact should be made with all parties during the transfer of leadership, and specific handover methods should be clarified to prevent the phenomenon of leadership interruption. The conference also particularly emphasized that schools must respect and rely on the leadership of the local Party committees.

The conference initially clarified the requirements and practices of teaching reform and unified the guiding ideology. The conference believes that teaching reform should include reforms in all aspects from the education system to teaching content, teaching methods, and teaching organization. It criticized the practice of mechanically dividing teaching content and teaching methods into unrelated parts for isolated reform and emphasized that teaching should be carried out sequentially and gradually according to the teaching plan. The teaching plan and syllabus should be resolutely implemented, and teaching should be conducted in accordance with the various teaching methods stipulated in the teaching plan. The conference clearly pointed out that it is necessary to earnestly study advanced Soviet experience and actively promote teaching reform in the future. The conference believes that the current focus should be on correcting conservative ideas that use combining with Chinese reality as an excuse for not actively learning from the Soviet Union, emphasizing difficulties without actively exploring potential, and not actively creating conditions. At the same time, it is also necessary to prevent the tendency of impatience and rash advance. The conference pointed out that improving the political and professional level of teachers, continuing to deepen ideological remolding, criticizing bourgeois ideology, and improving socialist consciousness play a decisive role in implementing teaching reform.

The conference pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the planning of cadre training and overcome blindness. The conference also stipulated that local industrial schools and local financial and economic schools should be under the unified leadership of the central competent departments in order to strengthen the planning of cadre training, and suggested that relevant departments complete the necessary adjustment work of their affiliated schools in the shortest possible time.

    全国中等专业教育行政会议闭幕
    会议确定今后中等专业教育的基本任务
    中央人民政府高等教育部召开的全国中等专业教育行政会议已在十七日闭幕。
    这次会议对解放以来中等专业教育的调整、整顿、改革工作进行了总结。会议根据国家在过渡时期的总任务和第一个五年计划的基本任务及全国文教工作的方针，确定今后中等专业教育的基本任务是：有计划地培养具有马克思列宁主义基础和必要的普通教育与基础技术的知识、掌握一定专业、身体健康、全心全意为社会主义建设服务的中等专业干部，以满足国家建设的需要。今后工作方针是：大力整顿、发展中等专业教育，努力学习苏联先进经验，积极推行教学改革，提高教学质量。为此，在当前应明确领导关系，尽快结束调整工作，并要求有关部门保证供应学校以教学计划、教学大纲、教科书、教学参考书及教具，以及组织教学工作的各种规章制度，以便学校能培养出在数量上和质量上能尽快满足国民经济发展过程中所需要的干部。
    会议根据中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会的指示，对中等专业学校的领导关系进行了讨论，并取得了一致的意见。中央人民政府高等教育部的责任是统一指导中等专业教育方面工作，各类学校都归各业务部门主管，各中央业务部门对中等专业学校应实行集中统一的直接领导，克服多头领导和无人负责的混乱现象。根据这一原则，管理方法分作两种：一种是中央业务部门直接管理，一种是在中央业务部门的统一领导下由省、市业务单位管理。省、市人民政府教育厅、局对学校在某些工作上有协助的责任。会议并建议各中央业务部门注意加强教育司。会议对实现这一原则的具体措施和步骤也分别作了安排，指出应采取积极态度有步骤地实现这一新的原则，在转移领导时应与各方取得密切联系，明确具体交接作法，防止领导中断的现象。会议并特别强调了学校必须尊重并依靠地方党委的领导。
    这次会议初步明确了教学改革的要求与作法，统一了指导思想。会议认为教学改革应包括从教育制度到教学内容、教学方法和教学组织等各方面的改革，批判了将教学内容和教学方法等机械划分为互不相关的部分孤立地进行改革的作法，强调应顺序地逐步地按照教学计划进行教学，坚决执行教学计划与教学大纲，要按照教学计划所规定的各种教学工作方式来进行教学。会议明确指出今后必须认真贯彻学习苏联先进经验，积极推行教学改革。会议认为当前应着重纠正以结合中国实际为借口而不积极学习苏联，强调困难而不积极挖掘潜力，不积极创造条件等保守思想。同时也要防止急躁冒进的偏向。会议指出：提高教师政治业务水平，继续深入思想改造，批判资产阶级思想，提高社会主义觉悟，对贯彻教学改革有决定作用。
    会议指出：必须加强培养干部的计划性，克服盲目性。会议并规定了地方工业学校、地方财经学校分别由中央主管部门统一领导，以便加强培养干部工作的计划性，并建议有关部门在最短期间完成所属学校的必要的调整工作。　　　（新华社）
