CCP Committees in Southwest China
Strengthen Leadership Over Agricultural Production Cooperatives

Under the leadership of rural Party organizations, 1,450 agricultural production cooperatives in the Southwest region have been consolidated and improved. To strengthen the Party's leadership over agricultural production cooperatives, the Guiyang Special District of Guizhou, with 122 cooperatives, is led by county Party secretaries or county Party committee members, directly overseen by district Party secretaries, and equipped with resident cadres to assist in their work. In April, the Jinning County Committee of Yunnan Province used the method of exchanging experiences to hold training classes for key members of 23 cooperatives, and 150 Party branch secretaries, cooperative cadres, and resident cadres received training. According to the distribution of 17 cooperatives in the county, the Suining County Committee of Sichuan Province established five leadership support points, and cooperatives regularly visited and exchanged experiences with each other. With the help of local Party committees, agricultural production cooperatives have gradually improved their management. With the help of Party organizations, nine cooperatives in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, have tapped their production potential, and this year's planned cotton planting area is 35.8 percent larger than last year's, and the unit area yield has increased by 20.3 percent. In Guizhou, 94 cooperatives implemented small-scale contracting, overcoming the chaotic phenomenon of working inefficiently, and improving production efficiency. The Hongxing Cooperative in Zunyi has also established a field production inspection system to ensure careful cultivation. In order to increase cooperative income, more than 500 cooperatives in Sichuan Province have planned to organize surplus labor for land processing and processing rice and grinding flour for supply and marketing cooperatives. Local CCP district committees and township branches have strengthened the political and ideological education of cooperative members. Some even have political instructors who regularly conduct patriotic and cooperative education for cooperative members.

    中共西南各地党委
    加强对农业生产合作社的领导
    西南区一千四百五十个农业生产合作社，在农村党组织领导下得到巩固提高。为加强党对农业生产合作社的领导，贵州贵定专区的一百二十二个社，都由县委书记或县委委员负责领导，区委书记直接掌握，并配备有驻社干部协助工作。云南晋宁县委四月间用交流经验的办法，举办了二十三个社的骨干训练班，有一百五十个党支部书记、社干部及驻社干部受到训练。四川遂宁县委根据全县十七个社地区分布情况，建立五个领导支点，社与社之间定期相互参观交流经验。农业生产合作社在各地党委的帮助下，逐步改善了经营管理。四川简阳县九个社在党组织帮助下，挖掘了生产潜力，今年计划棉花种植面积比去年扩大百分之三十五点八，单位面积产量增加百分之二十点三。贵州有九十四个社实行小包工，克服了一窝蜂、挤大堆的窝工混乱现象，提高了生产效率。遵义红星社并建立田间生产检查制，保证精耕细作。为了增加社内收入，四川五百多个社都有计划地组织剩余劳力进行土地加工，并为供销合作社加工碾米、磨面。各地中共区委和乡支部加强了对社员的政治思想教育。有的还有政治教员，经常向社员进行爱国爱社教育。
