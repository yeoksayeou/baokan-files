Work Plan of the Second Production Team of the State-owned Jiusan Farm
Ding Luxhu
The production team is the basic production unit of a state-owned farm. The success of a state-owned farm mainly depends on the production performance of the production team. Therefore, the management of the production team is an important part of the management of a state-owned farm. The Second Production Team of the State-owned Jiusan Mechanical Farm has created a "Ten-Day Work Plan" in its management work, which has given the team a new look of orderliness, smoothly completed the annual production tasks for 1953 ahead of schedule, and reduced production costs.

The Second Production Team of Jiusan Farm began to formulate monthly work plans in April last year. However, since agricultural production is easily affected by natural conditions, the time frame of the work plan was too long and difficult to grasp. Therefore, from late May, the team changed to making a plan every ten days, which was the beginning of the "Ten-Day Work Plan."

The method of formulating the "Ten-Day Work Plan" is that the production team leader first prepares a ten-day plan outline based on the current production work, and then convenes a joint meeting of the heads of each work group, union committee members, union group leaders, and Communist Youth League group leaders. This joint meeting is now called the "Working Committee." At the meeting, the team leader reports on the key points of the ten-day work based on the outline, and then everyone fully supplements it at the meeting. After studying and comprehensively presenting the work to be done in ten days, the team's strength is also brought out, and all the work is appropriately allocated. The method of allocating work is to arrange the items of work to be completed day by day, from the first day to the tenth day, and then make a balanced allocation and arrangement based on the team's labor organization.

Here is an example to illustrate. The work focus of the team's work plan for the first ten days of September last year was: 48 hectares of wheat to be threshed; assisting the Third Production Team in threshing; 100 hectares of wheat fields to be cleaned; fallow harrowing to be carried out; wheat to be sieved, bagged, and handed over to the state. After the team leader proposed the work focus at the joint meeting, Xiong Xiangshan, the production group leader, suggested: the threshed wheat piles are not clean, so personnel should be assigned to clean them up; Hou Yulin, the transportation group leader, suggested: there is not enough straw to feed the livestock, so personnel should be assigned to cut green grass. Because these two tasks were important, everyone agreed to add them to the plan. In this way, all the work was laid out. Then the tasks were assigned. As a result, it was determined that Combine No. 85 C-4 would be responsible for threshing the team's own wheat; Locomotive Group No. 92 "Natzi" would tow Combine No. 305 C-6 to support the Third Team in threshing; the production group would assign five people to participate in threshing, two people to clean up the threshing grounds, and three people to sieve and bag wheat, and two people to clean wheat stalks from fields. When discussing fallow harrowing, because there were no locomotives available, it was decided that this work would not be carried out temporarily in the first ten days of September.

After the work plan is determined, the content of the plan is listed on a table with twelve squares. The first square of this table indicates the work focus of the current ten days – this is a summary of the ten-day work center. From the second square to the eleventh square, there are a total of ten squares. Except for planned holidays and "flexible days," each square lists the work items of the day and the personnel responsible. There is also a column in each square called "Completion Status," which is prepared to record the completion status after a day's work has passed. The last square indicates the work focus of the next ten days, which is a reminder of the central work of the next ten days. The role of this reminder is: on the one hand, when the "Ten-Day Work Plan" is completed ahead of schedule, the central work of the next ten days can be brought forward; on the other hand, it can enable everyone to prepare for the work of the next ten days.

After the "Ten-Day Work Plan" form is filled out, it is posted and announced to all employees.

After the "Ten-Day Work Plan" was produced, although each task had specific personnel responsible, and the employees had a goal in mind, how to ensure the complete implementation of the plan was still an important issue.

How did the Second Production Team ensure that the plan could be completely implemented? The team only had two Communist Party members and no Party group. In addition to the Party members taking the lead, it mainly relied on the organization of the Communist Youth League and the trade union to promote the implementation of the plan and ensure its realization. After the "Ten-Day Work Plan" was determined, the trade union group leader announced it to all employees and mobilized them. Then, the Communist Youth League group mobilized the League members. Under the leadership of the Party and League members, all the employees of the team also took action.

After the employees took action, the trade union launched each work group to sign a contact contract to ensure the smooth implementation of the work plan. During the spring plowing, the contact contract they signed was that the harrowing locomotive group guaranteed timely harrowing and would not delay sowing; the seed distribution group guaranteed timely supply of seeds; the sowing locomotive group guaranteed to complete the sowing task ahead of schedule and beyond the quota.

Agricultural production has a great relationship with natural conditions. No matter how good the work plan is, if it is affected by natural conditions, there will be great changes. In addition, machinery often breaks down during operation. Due to these situations, the team has taken certain flexible measures in the implementation of the work plan, such as "flexible days." In this way, if special circumstances are encountered, there is still room for maneuver.

In the implementation of the plan, it is necessary to pay attention to timely inspection and summary of work. After the work plan is announced and implemented, in addition to the team leader's key supervision and inspection, the main thing is to rely on the locomotive group leaders and work group leaders to mobilize the masses for self-inspection. If good or bad examples are found in the inspection, they are promptly praised or criticized on the blackboard newspaper, which further promotes the work.

Summarize work once every ten days. The work committee that formulates the plan every ten days also simultaneously summarizes the work. Praise and criticism in the summary of work is the driving force for promoting the implementation of the plan. During the wheat harvest, the plan stipulated that the transporter Zhang Run should follow the combine to unload wheat, and the contact contract stipulated that Zhang Run guaranteed to haul as much as the combine harvested. One day, the livestock on the truck were sweating profusely because they had been working all morning and should have been unloaded for feeding and watering. However, the combine was waiting for sacks to unload grain, and the sacks could not be delivered, which affected the combine's harvest. This was a failure to execute the contract. In this case, Zhang Run did not eat lunch and carried forty sacks to the field. This positive action, after being praised at the meeting, became a learning model for everyone.

The role of the "Ten-Day Work Plan" is great. The most important thing is that it tightens the labor organization and improves work efficiency. Team leader Ma Chenglin made a comparison of the past situation: In the past, the team leader had to plan the work every day the night before, and then temporarily assign it the next morning. During the autumn plowing in 1952, because the work was temporarily assigned in the morning, three locomotives only began to refuel, maintain, and inspect in the morning. It was not until 9:00 AM that two locomotives went to the field. Another locomotive did not work all morning because of a problem. The combine hands had no work to do during the autumn plowing. After the implementation of planned operations, each locomotive group and each employee clearly understood their work tasks and gave play to their initiative and enthusiasm. In the first ten days of May last year, the plan stipulated that Locomotive No. 111 (then the monthly work plan was implemented) should first stubble 72 hectares, followed by plowing bean fields. The people in the locomotive group, on the afternoon of the day the stubble task was completed, checked the machine, added oil, and hooked up the five-bottom plow in order to be able to plow bean fields smoothly the next day. Zhang Fu, the assistant of the locomotive group, said: "In the past, we didn't know what to do tomorrow after finishing today's work. With a plan, we have a goal." The plan for Locomotive Group No. 92 stipulated that it would start plowing soybean fields from May 2nd. The people in the locomotive group checked and adjusted all parts of the locomotive on the evening of "May Day." At that time, they found that the cylinder head valve of the locomotive was moving. They repaired it overnight. The next morning, they officially started operations five minutes after breakfast. Under the circumstances that everyone gave play to their initiative and enthusiasm, they could overfulfill the workload of each operation every day.

Because the initiative and enthusiasm of the employees have been brought into play, the work of the team leader has also been proactive, getting rid of the circle of red tape. In the past, the team leader had to plan work and assign work every day, which was very passive. Now, with the work plan, the team leader can focus on grasping the work, discovering problems, solving problems, and improving work.

With a work plan, it is also possible to further strengthen the contact between administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations, so that the work of these units is in sync. In the past, the contact between the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League was not close enough, forming separate sets of activities. The Communist Youth League did not understand the focus of production work, and sometimes the meetings of the Communist Youth League and the meetings convened by the administration conflicted. The trade union did not actively mobilize employees to ensure the completion of production tasks, but only emphasized improving employee welfare. Now, by formulating a work plan, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League have strengthened their contact. At the same time, because the work of the entire production team is included in the plan, everyone's goals and actions are consistent, so that all work can be carried out around production work.

    国营九三农场第二生产队的作业计划
    丁履枢
    生产队是国营农场的基层生产单位。国营农场经营的好坏，主要决定于生产队的生产成绩，因而生产队的经营管理工作，是国营农场经营管理工作中重要的一环。国营九三机械农场第二生产队，由于在经营管理工作上，创造了“十日作业计划”，使该队的工作出现了有条不紊的新面貌，顺利地提前完成了一九五三年全年的生产任务，降低了生产成本。
    九三农场第二生产队从去年四月开始制定了月份的作业计划。但是由于农业生产容易受到自然条件的影响，作业计划的时间过长，不容易掌握，这样从五月下旬起，这个队就改为每十天订一次计划，这就是“十日作业计划”的开始。
    “十日作业计划”制订的方法，是先由生产队长根据当前的生产工作准备出一个十天的计划提纲，然后召开各作业组长、工会委员、工会小组长、青年团小组长联席会。这个联席会现在叫做“工作委员会”。在会上队长根据提纲报告十天工作的重点，然后大家在会上充分补充。这样经过研究并把十天要做的工作全面摆出来后，进一步就把全队的力量也摆出来，把所有的工作进行适当的分配。分配工作的方法，是逐日把应完成工作的项目排列起来，由第一天一直排到第十天，再根据全队的劳动组织，作出均衡的分配和布置。
    这里可以举一个例子来说明。这个队去年九月份上旬作业计划的工作重点是：四十八垧小麦要脱谷；帮助第三生产队脱谷；一百垧麦田要进行田间清理；进行休耕耙地；小麦过筛装袋，交给国家。在联席会上队长提出工作重点以后，生产组长熊向山提出：脱谷麦堆不净，要配备人员打扫；运输组长侯玉林提出：谷草不够喂牲口，应当配备人员割青草。因为这两项工作重要，大家都同意把它增加到计划里。这样就把全部工作摆开了。随着就进行分配任务，结果确定八十五号C—4康拜因担任本队脱谷；九十二号“纳齐”机车组牵引三零五号C—6康拜因应援第三队脱谷；生产组配备参加脱谷的五人，打扫脱谷底子二人，小麦过筛装袋三人，田间清理麦秸两人。研究到休耕耙地工作时，因为没有机车担负，决定九月上旬暂不进行这项工作。
    工作计划定出以后，就把计划内容列在一个画着十二个方格的表上。这张表的头一个方格注明本旬的工作重点——这是十天工作中心的提要。从第二格起到十一格止，一共十个方格，除了计划假日和
  “机动日”以外，每个方格里排列一天的工作项目和承担的人员，方格内并设有一栏“完成情况”，这是预备在一天的工作过去之后，把完成情况也填在上面。最后一个方格，注明下旬工作重点，这是下旬中心工作的一个提示。这个提示的作用是：一方面可以在“十日作业计划”提前完成时，好把下旬中心工作提上来，另一方面可使大家作好下旬工作的准备。
      “十日作业计划”的表格填好以后就贴出向全体职工公布。
      “十日作业计划”产生之后，虽然每项工作都有了具体的人员担负，职工们心中也有了目标，但是如何保证计划彻底实现，仍是一个重要问题。
    第二生产队怎样保证计划能够彻底实现呢？这个队只有两名共产党员，没有党的小组，除了党员带头之外，主要是依靠青年团和工会的组织，推动计划的执行和保证计划的实现。“十日作业计划”定出后，就由工会小组长向全体职工宣布，并进行动员。接着青年团小组就对团员进行动员。在党、团员的带头行动下，全队职工也就行动起来了。
    职工们行动起来以后，工会就发动各作业组订立联系合同，保证作业计划的顺利执行。春耕中，他们签订的联系合同是耙地机车组保证及时耙平，不误播种；配种组保证种子供应及时；播种机车组保证提前超额完成播种任务。
    农业生产和自然条件的关系很大，工作计划无论订的多好，如果受到自然条件的影响，就会有很大的变动；另外机械在作业中也常发生故障。由于这些情况，这个队在执行作业计划中，采取了一定的灵活性的措施，如“机动日”等。这样如果遇到特殊情况，仍有机动的余地。
    在执行计划中，必须注意及时检查和总结工作。工作计划公布执行后，除了队长重点的进行督促检查外，主要的是依靠各机车组长、作业组长发动群众进行自我检查。在检查中如发现好坏典型就及时在黑板报上进行表扬或批评，这就更进一步推动了工作。
    每旬总结工作一次。在每旬制订计划的工作委员会上，也同时进行总结工作。总结工作中的表扬和批评，是推动计划执行的动力。麦收中，运输员张润，在计划里规定跟着康拜因卸小麦，联系合同上规定，张润保证康拜因割多少他拉多少。有一天大车上的牲口因已干了一上午活，全身汗如雨淋，应该卸车喂饮了，但是康拜因上等着麻袋卸粮，麻袋送不上去，就影响了康拜因收割，这就是不执行合同。张润在这种情况下，午饭没有吃就扛着四十条麻袋送到地里。这一积极行动，经过会上表扬以后，就成了大伙的学习榜样。
     “十日作业计划”的作用是很大的。最主要的，是严密了劳动组织，提高了工作效率。队长马成林把过去的情况作了一个对比：以前每天的工作，队长头天晚上要筹划，第二天早晨又要临时分配。一九五二年秋翻地时，由于早晨临时分配工作，三台机车在早晨才开始注油、保养和检查，一直弄到上午九时，才有两台机车下地。另一台机车，因出了毛病，弄了一上午也没干上活。在秋翻地中康拜因手没有工作干。实行计划作业以后，每个机车组，每个职工，都明确了自己的工作任务，发挥了主动性和积极性。去年五月上旬，一一一号机车在计划里规定（当时实行的是月作业计划）先灭茬七十二垧，紧接着翻豆地。机车组的人们在灭茬任务完成的这天下午，为了第二天能够顺利进行翻豆地，就检查了机器，加了机油，挂好了五铧犁。机车组的助手张富说：“过去干完今天的活，不知道明天要干啥，有了计划咱们就有目标啦。”九十二号机车组，计划里规定从五月二日开始翻大豆地，机车组的人在“五一”节的晚上，把机车各部作了检查、调整，当时发现机车缸盖气瓣活动了，这天晚上他们连夜修好了。第二天早晨，饭后不过五分钟，就正式开始作业了。在大家都发挥了积极性主动性的情况之下，天天都能超额完成每项作业的工作量。
    由于发挥了职工的主动性和积极性，队长的工作也主动了，摆脱了事务主义的圈子。过去队长天天要计划工作，分配工作，非常被动；现在有了作业计划，队长就可以有重点地掌握工作，发现问题，解决问题，和改进工作了。
    有了作业计划，也能进一步加强行政、工会和青年团等组织的联系，使这些单位的工作步调一致。过去行政、工会和青年团的联系不够紧密，形成各搞一套。青年团不了解生产工作的重点，有时青年团的会议和行政上召开的会议还有冲突；工会不积极发动职工保证完成生产任务，只是强调改善职工福利。现在通过制订作业计划，行政、工会和青年团都加强了联系，同时由于把整个生产队的工作都订在计划里，大家的目标和行动都一致了，这样就能做到一切工作都围绕生产工作来进行。
