    Fuzhou's Famous Handicraft - Bodiless Lacquerware

    At the Leipzig International Fair, Fuzhou's handicraft, bodiless lacquerware, won the praise of many viewers. Abroad, in some sophisticated living rooms and buildings, people like to display various kinds of bodiless lacquerware such as hanging screens, folding screens, vases, tea sets, and smoking sets. Housewives are proud to entertain guests with these exquisite bodiless lacquerware fruit plates and tableware.
    The famous Fuzhou bodiless lacquerware handicraft has a long history. As early as more than two hundred years ago, Fuzhou had simple bodiless lacquerware. However, because the technology was not passed on, it was exclusively owned by the Shen Shao'an family for a long time. It was not until Shen Zhenghao took on apprentices fifty years ago that this unique skill was gradually promoted. Shen Zhenghao and others inherited the technical traditions of their predecessors, and after many years of hard work, they innovated and created many exquisite works of art. Among the works exhibited at the National Folk Art and Crafts Exhibition at the end of 1953, there was also an "Ao Yu Peach Plate" handmade by Shen Zhenghao fifty years ago, and its color is still as real as a peach.
    Bodiless lacquerware can be molded into various blanks according to needs to make various finished products. Its production process is very complicated: first, a mud blank is made, then silk cloth and summer cloth are pasted several times with lacquer. After half a month, the mud blank is removed, which is called full bodiless. The one supplemented by wood carving is called semi-bodiless, and the one made entirely of wood is called wooden-bodied lacquerware. After the bodiless process, the lacquer is applied and placed in a cellar or cabinet to isolate dust and let it dry slowly in the shade, and then lacquer is applied again. Each piece requires dozens of processes. The production time of a piece can be one or two months for a quick one and several years for a slow one. Bodiless lacquerware is not only beautiful and gorgeous in appearance, but also solid and light in weight, and very durable. It will not deform, lose lacquer, or fade when the temperature reaches freezing or boiling point.
    In the past, many artisans engaged in this production specialized in one skill and did not teach each other, and they were even unwilling to teach their own daughters. When they were working, if someone came to visit, they were afraid of leaking technical secrets, so they would rather stop working and chat. After several changes, bodiless lacquerware went from prosperity to decline. After some old workers died, their exquisite techniques were lost.
    After liberation, the local people's government and art workers helped the workers to re-create, and the bodiless lacquerware with a long history embarked on a new era. At the beginning of 1952, the local people's government invested in Shen Shao'an Lanji to establish the Fuzhou Bodiless Lacquerware Company, a joint state-private enterprise, to help many scattered workers organize production. The number of workers has also increased by 50% compared with the early days of liberation. In addition, the Beijing Special Arts and Crafts Company has placed a large number of orders, and sales are no longer a problem. Some elderly workers are now willing to teach the technical skills and experience they have accumulated for forty or fifty years to young workers. Li Zhiqing, a 54-year-old worker, paints and inlays flowers at the Fuzhou Bodiless Lacquerware Company, a joint state-private enterprise. He is preparing to systematically organize a set of materials on various techniques to teach young workers. Chen Dajun, a 64-year-old worker, leads a production team specializing in manufacturing export products. After the technology was made public and the old and new workers combined, the works and paintings became more colorful. The Guanyin Buddha statues and celestial maiden scattering flowers made in the past have become obsolete, and now many new works symbolizing world peace have emerged. The recent batch of gifts presented to the visiting delegation of the Korean people, as well as the Mao Zedong statues, various vases, smoking sets, tea sets, coffee sets, fruit plates, and other exhibits that will participate in the Leipzig International Fair and the Chinese Fine Arts and Crafts Exhibition to be held in the Soviet Union, Poland, and other countries, were carefully designed by outstanding artists such as Gao Xiuquan, Li Zhiqing, Guo Desen, Qi Yu, and Zheng Zengxun, as well as young workers. Currently, large numbers of orders are still coming from Moscow, Romania, Hungary, and Geneva. With the increase in orders, the old and new workers are researching technology and improving operating methods in order to make more various utensils that are not only artistically valuable but also have practical value.

    福州著名手工艺品——脱胎漆器
    新华社记者　梁逸名
    在来比锡国际博览会上，福州手工艺品脱胎漆器曾博得许多观众的赞赏。在国外，有些讲究的客厅和大厦里，人们喜欢陈列着挂屏、围屏、花瓶、茶具和烟具等各种各样的脱胎漆器。家庭主妇们能用这种精美的脱胎漆器果子盘和食具来招待客人，她会感到骄傲。
    著名的福州市脱胎漆器手工艺有悠久的历史。远在二百多年前，福州就有了简单的脱胎漆器。但因当时技术不外传，长时期仅为沈绍安一家独有，直到五十年前，传到沈正镐时才收门徒传艺，使这一独特的技艺逐渐推广起来。沈正镐等继承了前辈的技术传统，经过多少年月的辛勤劳动，推陈出新，创造了许多精巧的艺术品。一九五三年年底参加全国民间美术工艺品展览会展出的作品中，还有五十年前沈正镐手制“鳌鱼桃盘”，现在它的色彩还像真桃一样。
    脱胎漆器可以根据需要塑制各种坯胎做成各种各样的成品，它的制作过程非常复杂：先用泥塑坯后，以绸布、夏布上漆裱糊数次，半个月后掏去泥坯的叫全脱胎，辅以木雕的叫半脱胎，全木做成的是木胎漆器。脱胎后上漆放在地窖或橱里隔绝尘灰，让它慢慢阴干，然后又上漆。每做一件要经过数十道工序，一件作品的制作时间，快的要一两个月，慢的要数年之久。脱胎漆器不仅在外表上美观、华丽，而且还质固体轻，非常耐用，在温度达到冰点或沸点时，都不会变形、落漆或掉色。
    过去，许多从事这种生产的艺人都各专一技，互不传习，甚至连自己的女儿也不肯传授。当他们工作时，要是有人来串门，他们怕泄漏技术秘密，宁可停下工来聊天。经过数度变迁后，脱胎漆器由盛而衰。有些老工人死后，精湛的技术便失传了。
    解放后，当地人民政府和美术工作者帮助工人重新创作，有悠久历史的脱胎漆器才走上新的时代。一九五二年初，当地人民政府投资沈绍安兰记，建立了公私合营福州脱胎漆器公司，帮助许多分散的工人组织起来生产，工人人数也比解放初期增加了百分之五十。加以北京市特种工艺公司大量订货，销路已完全不成问题。一些年老工人，现在都愿意把积累了四五十年的技术和经验教给青年工人。五十四岁的老工人李芝卿在公私合营福州脱胎漆器公司绘画、镶花，他准备有系统地整理一套各种技术的材料，传授给年青的工人。六十四岁的老工人陈大俊领导一个生产小组，专门制造出国产品。技术公开和新老工人结合起来后，作品和绘画更加多姿多采了。以前做的观音佛像、天女散花已成为陈品，现在出现了许多象征世界和平的新作品。最近新制的一批赠送给朝鲜人民访华代表团的礼物，和出国参加来比锡国际博览会以及将在苏联、波兰等国家举行的中国美术工艺品展览会的毛主席塑像、各色花瓶、烟具、茶具、咖啡具、果盘等展品，都是优秀艺人高秀泉、李芝卿、郭德森、齐羽、郑增埙等和青年工人精心设计的。目前大批订货单还从莫斯科、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、日内瓦源源而来。随着订货的增加，新老工人都在研究技术，改进操作方法，以便做出更多的不仅有艺术价值，而且有使用价值的各种用具。
