Following the general election, people's representatives in various districts of Lüda City have employed diverse methods to establish close ties with the broad masses of voters, promoting various tasks and ensuring that the opinions and demands of the people are properly addressed.

A common method adopted by people's representatives in various districts is to convene voter meetings to report on the work of the government and their own activities to the voters. For example, before the sessions of the district people's congresses, they reported the central topics of the congresses to the voters and collected thousands of voter proposals through individual visits. After the meetings, they conveyed the resolutions of the meetings and the results of the proposals to the voters, mobilizing them to strive for the conscientious implementation of the resolutions. In the implementation of the resolutions of the first district people's congresses, many people's representatives also influenced and motivated voters through their exemplary actions.

Many people's representatives in the streets and some people's representatives in the workforce have also adopted the method of conducting individual visits with specific focuses to establish contact with voters. Sun Songshan, a people's representative in Lingqian District, resolved twenty-one marriage and other civil dispute cases for voters during two months of individual visits. Zhu Litian, a people's representative in Shahekou District and health administrator of the Second Glass Factory, has visited more than half of the voters in his constituency in the past three months, promptly resolving and reflecting more than seventy voter opinions. Many people's representatives have also established "Voter Comment Books" in factories, enterprises, government organizations, schools, and other units. Some people's representatives in factories, enterprises, and government organizations have also established "Voter Reception Days," regularly receiving voters on holidays or during certain times during the workday. Gong Zhiyuan, Secretary of the Lingqian District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and a people's representative, in addition to setting up a "Voter Comment Book" at home and conducting multiple individual visits, also designated Friday afternoons to receive voters in his office.

Some "People's Representative Groups" composed of street or factory enterprise units regularly gather and study how to resolve voter opinions. They meet once a week or every two weeks to study solutions or comprehensively reflect voter opinions to the government and exchange activity experiences. The People's Representative Group of Dagang Street in Xigang District promptly resolved five important voter opinions within the group while soliciting proposals for the People's Congress meeting. Among them, some voters proposed that primary schools assign too much homework to students, which affects children's health. After study, the People's Representative Group believed that this was a common phenomenon in local primary schools, so they reflected this opinion to the principal. The school then convened a special teachers' meeting to discuss and improve shortcomings in their work. (Xinhua News Agency)

    普选后的旅大市各区人民代表
    运用多种方法和选民建立密切联系
    普选后的旅大市各区人民代表运用了多种多样的方法和广大选民建立密切联系，推动了各种工作，使人民群众的意见和要求得到妥善的处理。
    各区人民代表普遍采用的联系方法是召开选民会议，向选民报告政府工作和自己的活动情况。例如他们曾在区人民代表大会会议召开以前，向选民们报告了大会的中心议题，又结合着个别访问征集了数以千计的选民提案；会后又向选民传达了会议决议和提案处理结果，并动员选民为认真贯彻会议的决议而努力。在贯彻第一次区人民代表大会会议的决议中，许多人民代表还以自己的模范行动影响和推动选民。
    许多街道中的人民代表和部分职工中的人民代表，还采用了有重点地进行个别访问的方法，和选民建立联系。岭前区人民代表孙松山，在两个月的个别访问中，给选民解决了婚姻及其他民事纠纷案件二十一件。沙河口区人民代表、第二玻璃厂卫生管理员朱立田，三个月来访问了本选区半数以上的选民，及时解决和反映了七十多件选民意见。许多人民代表还在工厂企业、机关团体、学校等单位建立了“选区人民留言簿”。有些工厂企业和机关中的人民代表还建立了“选区人民接待日”，在假日或抽出工作中的一定时间，定期接待选民。中共岭前区委员会书记、人民代表宫志远，在家中除设立“选区人民留言簿”并进行多次个别访问外，还确定每星期五下午在自己的机关里接待选民。
    有些以街道或工厂企业为单位组成的“人民代表小组”，经常汇集和研究解决选民的意见。他们每周或每两周开会一次，研究解决或综合向政府反映选民意见，并交流活动经验。西岗区大冈街的人民代表小组在为人民代表大会会议征集提案当中，及时在组内解决了五件重要的选民意见。其中有的选民提出小学校分配给学生的习题过多，影响儿童健康；人民代表小组经过研究后，认为这是当地小学校普遍存在的现象，便把这意见反映给小学校长；学校为此专门召开了教员会议，讨论改进了工作中的缺点。（据新华社讯）
