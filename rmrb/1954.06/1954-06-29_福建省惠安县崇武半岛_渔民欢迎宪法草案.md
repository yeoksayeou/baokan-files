    Fujian Province, Huian County, Chongwu Peninsula
    Fishermen Welcome the Draft Constitution
    The fishermen residing on the Chongwu Peninsula in Huian County, Fujian Province, conveyed the glad tidings of the promulgation of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China with gratitude and excitement.
    Chongwu Peninsula has had a bumper fish harvest this year. They naturally compared the benefits they have received since the establishment of New China with the many sufferings they endured in the old society, and wholeheartedly support the Draft Constitution. The fishermen believe that New China has brought them many benefits. Some people have listed these benefits as follows: First, the abolition of "fishing tyrants," fish merchants, and usurious exploitation; second, reasonable fish prices when purchased by the aquatic products company; third, the People's Bank provides loans to support fishermen's production; fourth, the state implements a planned grain supply, ensuring that fishermen can buy grain at reasonable prices; fifth, organizing mutual aid and cooperation under the encouragement and guidance of the government, taking the road to common prosperity.
    Fisherman Zhang Jiajin carefully calculated all these benefits. He said: Before liberation, we were called "sea-tilling oxen," and we couldn't even keep twenty catties out of every hundred catties of fish we caught. Now every fish is our own. If we had a "big haul" like this year before liberation, the fish merchants would have driven down the prices so low that the fish and shrimp wouldn't even fetch the price of sweet potatoes. Last year, six of us jointly borrowed 9 million yuan from the People's Bank and bought a boat. This year, each of us earned 4 to 5 million yuan, and the loan has been repaid. Now, fishermen no longer have to worry about rising rice prices like in the past. They sell their fish and rush to buy grain, and can invest their capital in production. Zhang Jiajin said: Today, the Draft Constitution stipulates these benefits we have received, which guarantees that we will forever get rid of poverty and live a good life. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 福建省惠安县崇武半岛  渔民欢迎宪法草案

    福建省惠安县崇武半岛
    渔民欢迎宪法草案
    居住在福建省惠安县崇武半岛上的渔民们怀着感激和兴奋的心情，传告中华人民共和国宪法草案公布的喜讯。
    崇武半岛今年鱼产大丰收，都很自然地把他们从新中国建立以来得到的好处和在旧社会里受到的许多痛苦相对比，衷心地拥护宪法草案。渔民们认为新中国给他们带来的好处很多。有的人把这种好处列举为这样几点：第一、取消了“渔霸”、鱼行和高利贷剥削；第二、水产公司收购鱼价合理；第三、人民银行贷款支持渔民生产；第四、国家实行粮食计划供应，保证渔民可以买到合理价格的粮食；第五、在政府鼓励和指导下组织互助合作，走共同富裕的道路。
    渔民张家进把这几条好处都算了一笔细账。他说：解放前我们被叫做“讨海牛”，打一百斤鱼自己还得不到二十斤。现在每一条鱼都是自己的。像今年这样“大发海”，如果在解放前，鱼行一压价，鱼虾连甘薯的价钱都卖不到。去年我们六个人合伙向人民银行贷了九百万元，买了一条船，今年每人收入四五百万元，贷款都还清了。现在渔民也不用像过去那样担心米价涨，卖了鱼就抢着买粮，可以把资金投入生产了。张家进说：今天，宪法草案把我们得到的这些好处规定下来，这就是使我们永远摆脱贫困过美好生活的保证。（新华社）
