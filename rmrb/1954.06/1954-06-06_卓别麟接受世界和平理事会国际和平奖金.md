Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 5th: The world-renowned film actor Charlie Chaplin accepted the World Peace Council's 1953 International Peace Prize on the 3rd at his residence near Lausanne. Attending the award ceremony were four members of the World Peace Council's International Peace Prize and Gold Medal Judging Committee: Vercors, Chairman of the French National Writers Committee; Professor Singer, member of the Edinburgh Science Institute of the United Kingdom and Nobel Prize winner; Jorge Zalamea Borda, Secretary of the International Peace Prize and Gold Medal Judging Committee and Colombian writer; and André Bonnard, Chairman of the Swiss Peace Committee.

Vercors, on behalf of the World Peace Council and the World Peace Council International Peace Prize and Gold Medal Judging Committee, presented the award certificate to Charlie Chaplin. In his address, Vercors praised Charlie Chaplin's contribution to the cause of peace. He said: Chaplin's films have inspired people to recognize that war is a sinful and foolish thing. He said to Chaplin: "For forty years you have insisted on telling us that people are real. For peace-loving human beings, there is no other reasonable path than their brotherly unity in mutual love and help to resist blind power." Professor Singer, in congratulating Chaplin, particularly pointed out that Chaplin not only understood that war is meaningless, but also made millions of people understand this through his creations.

In his reply, Chaplin said: The desire for peace is very common. I firmly believe that any demand for peace, whether it comes from the East or the West, is a step in the right direction. Therefore, I am very happy to accept this award and feel honored by it.

Chaplin said: I certainly know that countries can never solve the problems that threaten peace in an atmosphere of hatred and suspicion, nor can they solve these problems with the threat of dropping hydrogen bombs. In this age of atomic science, countries should think less about solving their differences by violence as they did in the past, but rather consider solving them by constructive methods. We must eliminate the unfortunate and poisonous atmosphere caused by the threat of hydrogen bomb warfare. Let us understand each other's problems. Let us restore the natural and healthy elements of mankind, restore the spirit of goodwill, which is the foundation of all inspiration, all creation, beauty and sublimity in life. Let us work towards that goal—towards a glorious era of peace in which all nations will prosper!

    卓别麟接受世界和平理事会国际和平奖金
    【新华社日内瓦五日电】世界著名的电影演员卓别麟三日在洛桑附近他的寓所里接受了世界和平理事会一九五三年度国际和平奖金。参加授奖仪式的有世界和平理事会国际和平奖金与金质奖章评议委员会的四位委员：法国作家全国委员会主席维尔高尔、英国爱丁堡科学研究所会员、诺贝尔奖金得奖人辛格教授、国际和平奖金与金质奖章评议委员会书记哥伦比亚作家豪尔赫·萨拉米亚·波尔达和瑞士和平委员会主席安德烈·邦纳。
    维尔高尔代表世界和平理事会和世界和平理事会国际和平奖金与金质奖章评议委员会把奖状授予卓别麟。维尔高尔在致辞中赞扬卓别麟对和平事业的贡献。他说：卓别麟的电影曾经启发人们认识战争是罪恶的、笨拙的事。他对卓别麟说：“四十年来你坚持地告诉我们说，人是真实的。对于爱好和平的人类来说，除了他们之间在互爱和互助之下兄弟般的团结以抵抗盲目的强权以外，是别无其他合理的途径的。”辛格教授向卓别麟致贺时特别指出卓别麟不但了解战争是毫无意义的，而且还通过了他的创作使千百万人民了解这一点。
    卓别麟在致答词时说：要求和平的愿望是很普遍的。我坚决相信，不论是从东方或西方提出来的和平要求，都是朝着这个正确方向走的一个步骤。因此，我很高兴地接受这个奖金，并为此而感到光荣。
    卓别麟说：我确实知道，各国永远无法在仇视和猜疑的气氛中解决威胁和平的问题，也不能以投氢弹的威胁来解决这些问题。在这个原子科学时代，各国应更少地想到像从前那样以暴力来解决它们的分歧，而是要考虑以建设性方法来解决。我们要消灭氢弹战争的威胁所引起的不幸的、有毒的气氛。让我们了解彼此的问题。让我们恢复人类的自然和健康的因素，恢复善意的精神，这种精神是一切鼓舞、是人生中的一切创造、美丽和崇高的基础。让我们向着那个目的——向着一个各国都会繁荣的光辉的和平时代而努力吧！
