    Several Understanding Problems Concerning Material Supply Work
    Chen Ping, Director of the Material Supply Department of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways
    In new railway infrastructure construction, material costs generally account for about 60% of the total national investment. In railway infrastructure construction, increasing production and practicing economy, reducing project costs, improving project quality, ensuring project progress, rationally using national investment, and using every cent of the country in the most important places to maximize the effect of national investment, doing a good job in material supply is one of the main factors.

    To do a good job in material supply, according to our experience, it is necessary to solve several ideological understanding problems. First, we must establish the idea of planned management of material supply work. The planned management of material supply work is the decisive factor in ensuring material supply, overcoming the blindness of material supply work, and implementing economic accounting; and correctly organizing material application work is the basis of planned management of material supply work. The idea of "rather more than less" and "loose budgeting" in material application will inevitably lead to material backlog and affect the turnover of national funds, while unilaterally applying for less and later will inevitably hinder the progress of the project and fail to ensure the completion of national infrastructure construction tasks. As far as the current situation is concerned, it is indeed difficult to correctly submit material applications due to the late determination of plans and the late submission of design documents, but as long as the leadership attaches importance to the planned management of material supply work, attaches importance to material application work, strengthens organizational work, and submits material applications based on the outline of the project task, the situation of each key project, the material consumption quota and past statistics, it is entirely possible.
    Second, we must recognize the relative dominant and active role of material work in engineering technical design work. This role is mainly manifested in the early stage of engineering technical design. The material department should actively collect information, understand market conditions and various industrial production conditions in various places, sources of materials, production volume and product quality, especially the situation of domestic products. In short, it is necessary to do all the investigation and research work in advance, make detailed price comparisons, and systematically and analytically introduce them to the engineering technical design department, so that the engineering design documents have material guarantees, can be designed according to the material, used according to the material, and use domestic products as much as possible, so that the technical design documents are more practical. In the past, we did not have enough understanding of this relative dominant and active role, and always thought that material work was completely passive. Because of insufficient understanding, material work often means buying whatever is needed, and at the same time, there is a phenomenon of not having what is needed and not wanting what is available, causing losses to national property. For example, in the Huanghe River wooden pontoon bridge project, when studying the construction method, it was stipulated that large iron barges with a load of 50 tons and motorboats of about 35 horsepower should be used to undertake the transportation work between the two sides. At that time, the material department had reliable transportation tools in its possession, which were 39 small iron barges with a load of about 2 tons and cowhide rafts that were very skilled in the use of local people. It was estimated that these transportation tools could be competent, but the designers were accustomed to the operation methods in the south, and always felt that it was not safe without motorboats. We did not conduct further investigation and research, and spent a lot of effort. The Ministry of Communications transferred two motorboats and recruited six unemployed sailors from Tianjin, who rushed to the northwest from thousands of miles away. The motorboats were launched for trial navigation, but they could not move at all and were of no use at all, causing a lot of waste.
    Third, we must establish the idea of using substitute materials and using local materials. Substitute materials are an important method to solve stagnant materials, capital backlog and implement economic accounting, and also a kind of innovation in engineering materials, which is a pioneering work to break the old capitalist material indicators and create new indicators. Material substitution must be done by using small materials instead of large materials and inferior materials instead of superior materials, and implemented under the principle of ensuring that the project quality is not reduced. We have had some achievements in substitute materials. For example, in the past, wooden awning poles were used to erect the tarpaulin when transporting cement, which cost an average of 75,000 yuan per vehicle. Later, bamboo poles were used instead, which only cost 35,000 yuan. We also used bark to saw 100,000 square meters with the same load-bearing capacity as rafters, which were used instead of rafters, saving more than 250 million yuan, solving the difficulty of sourcing small wood materials, and also using uncut crushed bark to replace bamboo and mats used for building houses. Using local materials is one of the most important measures to reduce project costs. In the past, we lacked sufficient attention and serious investigation and research on this issue, and many unnecessary waste phenomena occurred. For example, linseed oil is a specialty of the northwest, especially in the vicinity of Tianshui, where there is a large output, but the people of the northwest call it sesame oil. We thought they were two different things, and rushed to Tianjin, spent more than half a year, wasted a lot of manpower, and in the end, we were sent back to solve it locally. Another example is oak, which is produced in large quantities in the Qinling Mountains, but the local people call it Qingtang wood, so we rushed to the northeast to purchase it. These mistakes can be completely avoided with a little investigation and research.
    To do a good job in material supply work, it is also necessary to formulate practical material application plans and supply plans. Under normal circumstances, when the preliminary design is completed, the material department should start to make application plans. The application plan is the main material basis for material supply work and the basis for estimating the inventory quota. After all technical documents are complete, and the engineering technical measures plan and engineering progress are arranged, the material department should make a full-year material supply plan with analysis and research, further determine the inventory quota, and specifically study the substitution of some materials with the technical department. But in the past, we often did not do this, and often paid attention to the application plan and neglected the supply plan. The supply plan lacked technical measures, which caused backlog.
    To do a good job in the material supply plan, we need to correctly determine the inventory quota. The inventory quota is not unchangeable, it changes with the progress of the project and the changes in the technical consumption quota. Therefore, to prepare a material supply plan and determine the inventory quota, we must first grasp the project progress, so as to correctly arrange the time for materials to enter the factory, and distinguish the priorities and urgency of the overall work, and supply materials step by step and evenly. To grasp the project progress, we must first grasp the key projects, make separate material supply plans for the key projects, and assign special personnel to be responsible for grasping them. Because key projects have a decisive role in the completion of the entire line project and the early opening of traffic, grasping key projects also means grasping the main contradictions in the project. Second, determining the inventory quota should always care about the changes in the actual technical consumption quota. The technical consumption quota is the balance to measure the technical level and political consciousness of workers, and it is something that increases with the improvement of the technical level and political consciousness of workers. Material workers should always care about the site, contact the site, understand the improvement of workers' skills, collect advanced technical consumption quotas, and adjust the inventory quota in a timely manner.
    To do a good job in the material supply plan, we must also recognize the comprehensiveness of the supply work. The so-called comprehensiveness of supply work, the first is to supply materials in complete sets, and the second is to keep materials in complete sets. Failure to do these two points will result in losing the big picture due to small losses. In the past, we only did the first point and did not do the second point. For example, the Beidaobu Material Factory kept the wing plates and screws that must be used together separately. When the project was rushing to work, the comrades in charge of the wing plates did not see the screws and were anxious, and urgently urged the procurement team to quickly purchase a large number of screws; the comrades in charge of the screws were worried that no one would claim the large number of screws. In order to keep materials in complete sets for complete supply, we should break the obstruction and restriction of the old material catalog on us, and establish a new management system for keeping materials in complete sets, so that the classification and storage of materials are subject to the needs of the project.
    Grasping the main materials without relaxing the general materials is an important guiding ideology for preparing the material supply plan. The railway infrastructure construction needs a lot of materials, but to sum up, there are only more than 300 kinds that are commonly used and used in large quantities. These more than 300 kinds of materials not only account for more than 80% of the total amount of materials, but also account for the most transportation tonnage, the largest storage space and warehouses. If there is a slight negligence in procurement, transportation, storage and storage, and the timing of feeding and issuing materials, it will cause alarming losses. These materials must be placed in the most important position. But on the other hand, the supply of general materials is also not to be ignored. The supply work of an overall project composed of various materials is indispensable.
    To do a good job in material supply, it is also necessary to strengthen statistical and inspection work. Statistics is a scientific tool to express actual work, and an important basis for discovering problems and revising plans. However, statistical work is precisely the weakest link in the material department. There is no statistics at ordinary times, and temporary patchwork is busy. Not only does it not play the role of checking and revising the plan, but it also makes people feel that "statistics is troublesome", and the statistical figures are often incorrect. In addition, there are also problems in the content of statistics. If there is no statistics, it is all right. If you want to do statistics, even trivial things are put in it, but the important parts cannot be seen. Moreover, the statistical reports are made too late. Therefore, strengthening statistical work should be taken as one of the main tasks in the future. In order to find problems in the work in time and correct shortcomings, it is also necessary to strengthen supervision and inspection and specific assistance to the site. Some work was done in this regard last year, and the results were great. For example, at the beginning of last year, the Lanzhou section shouted that more than 500 tons of cement in the Lujiaya material warehouse were hardened and could not be used. We repeatedly called and telegraphed them to check the sieving and submit samples for testing, but it was never resolved. In June, we sent cadres to check and extracted samples for testing, which proved that most of them met the standards. Another example is that in December last year, we sent people to Wushaoling to check the work and found that the main materials of many cross-year key projects in the section, such as cement and wood, were not stored at all. The reason was that they misinterpreted the material backlog, thinking that not storing any materials means no backlog and accelerating capital turnover. We immediately took the initiative to help the section rush to transport more than 3,000 tons of materials before the end of the year, avoiding the danger of stopping work and waiting for materials.

    关于材料供应工作的几个认识问题
    中央铁道部第一工程局材料供应处处长　陈平
    在新建铁路基本建设中，材料费用一般占全部国家投资总额的百分之六十左右。在铁路基本建设中增产节约，降低工程成本，提高工程质量，保证工程进度，合理地使用国家投资，把国家每一分钱都用到最主要的地方去，以发挥国家投资的最大效果，做好材料供应工作就成为其中主要因素之一。
      要做好材料供应工作，根据我们的体会，必须解决几个思想认识问题。首先要树立材料供应工作的计划管理思想。材料供应工作的计划管理乃是保证材料供应，克服材料供应工作的盲目性，贯彻经济核算的决定因素；而正确地组织材料申请工作，则是材料供应工作计划管理的基础。材料申请中的“宁多毋少”、“宽打窄用”思想必然造成材料积压，影响国家资金周转，而片面地少申请，迟申请必然妨碍工程的进展，无法保证国家基本建设任务的完成。就目前情况而言，计划确定较晚、设计文件提出较迟，正确地提出材料申请确有一定困难，但只要领导上重视材料供应工作的计划管理，重视材料申请工作，加强组织工作，根据工程任务轮廓，根据各重点工程情况，根据材料消耗定额和过去统计数字，提出材料申请是完全可能的。
    其次，要认识材料工作对工程技术设计工作相对的主导与积极作用。这种作用主要表现在工程技术设计初期，材料部门要积极主动地搜集资料，了解市场情况及各地的各种工业生产情况，料源，生产量及产品质量，尤其重要的是国产品的情况。总之是事先作好一切调查研究工作，做出详细的比价，有系统有分析地介绍给工程技术设计部门，使工程设计文件有物质上的保证，能够因材设计，因材使用，尽量用国产品，使技术设计文件更加切合实际。我们过去对这种相对的主导与积极作用是体会不够的，总认为材料工作是完全被动的。因为认识不足，材料工作常常是要啥买啥，同时就产生要啥没啥，有啥偏不要的现象，使国家财产受到损失。例如黄河木便桥的工程，在研究施工方法时，规定要五十吨载重的大型铁驳船及三十五匹马力左右的汽艇来担负两岸的运输工作，当时材料处已掌握的可靠运输工具是载重两吨左右的小铁驳船三十九艘及当地群众使用得很熟练的牛羊皮筏子，预计这些运输工具是可以胜任的，但设计人员习惯于南方的操作方法，总觉得没有汽艇不保险，我们也没有进一步调查研究，费了九牛二虎之力，由中央交通部调拨了汽艇两艘，又从天津招来失业海员六名，不远千里赶到西北，汽艇下水试航就寸步难行，根本用不上，造成许多浪费。
    再次，要树立使用代用材料和就地取材的思想。代用材料是解决呆滞材料，资金积压和实行经济核算的重要方法，也是工程用料上的一种革新，是打破旧的资本主义材料指标，创造新的指标的创举。材料代用一定是以小料代大料，以劣料代优料，并在保证不使工程质量降低的原则下实行。我们在代用材料上有过一些成绩，例如以前运水泥都用木篷杆将篷布架起，平均每车要七万五千元，后来以竹杆代替，只要三万五千元，又曾利用板皮锯成和椽木有同样承载力的方木十万根，代替椽木使用，节约了二亿五千余万元，解决了细小树材来源的困难，同时又利用不成材的碎板皮替代盖房用的毛竹和席子。就地取材是降低工程成本最重要的措施之一，过去我们对这个问题缺乏足够的注意和认真的调查研究，发生许多不应该有的浪费现象。例如亚麻油是西北的特产，特别是天水附近有大量出产，只不过西北人民称之谓胡麻油，我们以为是两种东西，赶到天津，花了半年多时间，浪费了不少人力，结果还是被打回来就地解决。又如柞木，秦岭上就有大量出产，只不过当地人民叫它青钢木，我们就赶到东北去采购，这些错误，只要稍加调查研究就可以完全避免。
    要作好材料供应工作，还必须制订切合实际的材料申请计划和供应计划。在正常的情况下，初步设计做好时，材料部门即应着手作申请计划，申请计划是材料供应工作的主要物质基础，是预计库存定量的根据。待全部技术文件完备后，工程技术措施计划，工程进度排好后，材料部门即应做出全年的、有分析、有研究的材料供应计划，进一步确定库存定量，具体地与技术部门研究部分材料的代用。但过去，我们往往不是这样做的，往往注意到申请计划，忽视了供应计划，供应计划中又缺少技术措施，因而造成了积压。
    做好材料供应计划，就要求我们正确地确定库存定量。库存定量不是一成不变的，它随着工程的进展，技术消耗定额的变化而变化。因此，编制材料供应计划，确定库存定量，首先要掌握工程进度，以正确地安排材料进厂的时间，分别全盘工作的先后缓急，有步骤地，均衡地供应材料。要掌握工程进度，首先就要掌握重点工程，作出重点工程的单独材料供应计划，并派专人负责掌握。因为重点工程对全线工程完工和提前通车，有着决定性的作用，掌握了重点工程也就是掌握了工程中的主要矛盾。其次，确定库存定量要经常关怀实际技术消耗定额的变化。技术消耗定额是测定工人技术水平和政治觉悟的天秤，是随着工人技术水平和政治觉悟的提高而提高的东西。材料工作者就应该经常关心现场、联系现场，了解工人技术提高的情况，收集先进的技术消耗定额，及时调整库存定量。
    做好材料供应计划，还必须认识供应工作的全面性。所谓供应工作的全面性，第一是成套地完备地供应材料，第二是成套地齐全地保管材料。不能做到这两点就会因小失大。过去我们只做到第一点，没有做到第二点。如北道埠材料厂将必须一并使用的合翼和螺丝分开保管，工程赶工时，管理合翼的同志看不见螺丝着了忙，急催采购组速购大批螺丝；管螺丝的同志却在发愁大批的螺丝没人领用。为了成套地齐全地保管材料，以便齐全地供应，就应该打破旧的材料目录对我们的妨碍和限制，建立新的成套的材料保管的管理制度，使材料的分类、保管、都服从工程需要。
    掌握主要材料，又不放松一般材料，是编制材料供应计划的重要指导思想。铁路基本建设所需材料繁多，但归纳其通常使用和大量使用的，也只三百多种。这三百多种材料不仅占了材料总金额的百分之八十以上，而且占了最多的运输吨位，最大的存放场地和仓库，如果在采购上、运输上、存放保管上、进料与发料的时间上有一点疏忽，就会造成惊人的损失。必须把这些材料放在最重要的位置上。但另一方面，一般材料的供应工作也是不容忽视的，一个由多种材料组成的整体工程的供应工作是缺一不可的。
    要做好材料供应工作，还必须加强统计和检查工作。统计是表示实际工作的科学工具，是发现问题，修正计划的重要依据。但统计工作恰恰是材料部门最薄弱的一环。平时不统计，临时忙拼凑，不但起不到检查和修正计划的作用，反而使人感到
  “统计麻烦”，统计出来的数字也常常是不正确的。另外，在统计内容上也有毛病，不统计则已，要统计就是鸡毛蒜皮的东西都放在里面，重要的部分反而看不出来。而且统计表报做出来的时间也太迟。因此，要把加强统计工作作为今后的主要任务之一。为了及时发现工作中的问题，纠正缺点，还必须加强监督检查和对现场的具体帮助，去年在这方面曾做了一些工作，收效很大。例如兰州段去年年初就叫喊陆家崖料库有五百多吨水泥硬化不能使用，我们一再去电话电报催他们检查过筛，提样品化验，一直没有得到解决。六月间派了干部去检查，并提取样品试验，证明绝大部分都合乎标准。再如去年十二月派人赴乌鞘岭检查工作，发现该段很多跨年度重点工程的主要材料，如水泥、木料等，一点也没有储备，原因是曲解材料积压，认为一点也不储备材料便是不积压，便是加速资金周转，当即主动帮助该段在年前抢运去三千多吨材料，避免了停工待料的危险。
