Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 15th.

Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates:

    In my speech on June 11th, I stated that our discussions on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue have achieved considerable consensus and converging opinions. We should affirm the agreed and potentially agreeable points, and then continue discussions on the points of divergence to reach a complete agreement on all issues. Therefore, we believe that this conference has no reason not to continue the discussion based on the proposal made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on June 5th, in order to reach an agreement on the peaceful reunification of Korea. We have carefully studied the speeches of the delegates who opposed Mr. Molotov's proposal, but we must point out that their arguments are completely untenable.

    When Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov put forward his five principles, he pointed out that many issues remained to be resolved, and he did not underestimate the complexity of this situation. It is precisely to resolve these differences that it is necessary to affirm the agreed and approaching agreed opinions. This is a common-sense procedure followed by every conference. However, those who oppose Mr. Molotov's proposal have adopted an unconventional attitude, saying that under each agreed or nearly agreed principle, there are many points of divergence. If these points of divergence are not resolved at the same time, what is the use of affirming these principles? In fact, it is precisely in order to better resolve these divergences that it is necessary to affirm the agreed and nearly agreed opinions. Only those who fundamentally oppose reaching any agreement and their followers would oppose this procedure.

    How has the discussion on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue reached its current state? On April 27th, Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea proposed a plan for restoring the national unity of Korea and holding free all-Korean elections. During the discussion, the majority of delegates emphasized the necessity of international supervision of the all-Korean elections. On May 22nd, the delegation of the People's Republic of China suggested that neutral countries that did not participate in the Korean War be responsible for this international supervision. This should have opened up broad possibilities for reaching an agreement on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. However, on the same day, the representative of the Republic of Korea proposed that the South Korean government unify the entire Korea. In order to promote the progress of the conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov put forward five principles on June 5th. These were proposed by summarizing the consensus and converging opinions already reached by the delegates of participating countries, including the representative of the Republic of Korea. However, these suggestions were again opposed by the US representative and other representatives. It is evident that the US representative and the representatives who followed the US are fundamentally unwilling to reach any agreement on the peaceful reunification of Korea. In fact, even before the conference began, certain influential figures in the US government had already publicly announced the policy of not allowing the Geneva Conference to succeed. The development of the Geneva Conference until now has confirmed this. The US obstructionist policy towards the Geneva Conference is the fundamental reason why this conference has not been able to reach an agreement so far.

    Mr. Chairman, we firmly believe that Mr. Molotov's five principles on the peaceful reunification of Korea on June 5th are completely reasonable. It is very regrettable that the participating countries have not yet been able to reach an agreement on the issue of achieving the peaceful reunification of Korea through free all-Korean elections. The peace-loving people of the world expect our conference to reach a complete agreement on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Judging from the current situation of the conference, even though we cannot reach an agreement on the peaceful reunification of Korea for the time being, we should also strive to reach an agreement on consolidating peace in Korea. This is very important for the benefit of the Korean people and for the consolidation of peace in the Far East and the world.

    The six suggestions made today by Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding guaranteeing peace in Korea are precisely in line with this requirement. The delegation of the People's Republic of China fully supports the proposals of Foreign Minister Nam Il.

    The Korean armistice, hailed by the world, was seen as the first step towards the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The reason we are able to meet here is precisely because the war in Korea has stopped and the Korean armistice remains in effect. However, I must point out that the Korean armistice is facing an increasing threat due to the continuous clamor of the Republic of Korea government for a northward march to unify Korea, and this clamor has been echoed by certain US officials. They are trying to use every possible means to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement. At the same time, although Korea has an armistice, the state of armistice is not yet a consolidated peace. We should strive to turn the state of armistice in Korea into a state of peace. Therefore, when we are unable to reach an agreement on the peaceful reunification of Korea for the time being, we have an obligation to take measures to consolidate peace in Korea in order to create conditions for the peaceful reunification of Korea.

    In order to gradually demilitarize Korea, the withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Korea is the primary condition. Article 60 of the Korean Armistice Agreement clearly stipulates that this issue must be resolved after the armistice, and the countries concerned have an obligation to implement this provision. The delegation of the People's Republic of China fully agrees that all foreign armed forces should be withdrawn from Korean territory proportionally within the shortest possible time. Due to the war, the number of troops in the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has increased significantly, which has brought a heavy burden to the Korean people. Therefore, in order to gradually demilitarize and reduce the burden on the Korean people, it is absolutely necessary to reduce the number of troops on both sides. However, the issue of gradually demilitarizing and restoring the armies of both sides to a state of peace is not a simple one, and it is therefore necessary for a committee composed of representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to be responsible for considering such issues. At the same time, in order to facilitate and promote the peaceful reunification of Korea, the military treaties signed between a certain part of Korea and other countries, such as the "US-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty," cannot be considered permissible.

    In order to create conditions for the peaceful reunification of Korea, it is required that North and South Korea be able to approach each other, rather than continue to confront each other. Therefore, it is appropriate and necessary for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to form an all-Korean committee composed of representatives from both sides to discuss transitional measures related to economic and cultural ties between the two sides.

    Given that the Korean armistice is not yet in a stable state, the participating countries of this conference have a duty to ensure the peaceful development of Korea.

    Based on the above, we believe that the six proposals of Foreign Minister Nam Il provide the basic conditions for guaranteeing the peaceful development of Korea. We have no reason why we cannot reach an appropriate agreement on the basis of the six proposals made by Foreign Minister Nam Il. To this end, the delegation of the People's Republic of China proposes that this conference convene a restricted meeting of seven countries, including China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Republic of Korea, to discuss relevant measures to consolidate peace in Korea. We hope that the delegates of the participating countries will give serious consideration to this proposal.

### 在日内瓦会议六月十五日会议上  周恩来外长的发言

专栏：

    在日内瓦会议六月十五日会议上
    周恩来外长的发言主席、各位代表先生：
    我在六月十一日的会上曾经说过，我们对于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论已经取得了不少一致和接近一致的意见，我们应该把已经一致和可以一致的意见肯定下来，然后对分歧之点继续讨论，以便对各项问题达成完全的协议。因此我们认为，本会议没有理由不根据六月五日苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫先生的建议，继续讨论，以便对和平统一朝鲜问题达成协议。我们仔细地研究了反对莫洛托夫先生建议的各国代表的发言，但是，不能不指出，他们所持的论点是完全站不住的。
    苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫先生在提出他的五项原则建议时就已经指出，还有很多问题尚待解决，他决不低估这种形势的复杂性。正是为了要解决这些分歧，才有必要把已经一致和接近一致的意见肯定下来。这本是每一种会议所遵循的合乎常识的程序。但是，反对莫洛托夫先生建议的人们却采取了一种不合常情的态度，他们说在每一项已经协议或接近协议的原则下面，还有很多的分歧之点，如果关于这些分歧之点不同时加以解决，肯定这些原则又有什么用处呢？其实，正是为了更好地进一步解决这些分歧，才有必要将已经一致和接近一致的意见肯定下来。只有根本反对达成任何协议的人和他的附和者才会反对这种程序。
    关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论是怎样达到目前的状况的呢？四月二十七日朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表南日外务相就提出了恢复朝鲜的国家统一和举行全朝鲜自由选举的方案。在讨论过程中，多数代表们强调了对全朝鲜选举进行国际监察的必要。五月二十二日，中华人民共和国代表团建议由未参加朝鲜战争的中立国家负责此项国际监察。这本应为和平解决朝鲜问题展开达成协议的广阔的可能性。但是，在同一日，大韩民国的代表却提出了由南朝鲜政府统一全朝鲜的建议。为了推动会议的进展，六月五日苏联莫洛托夫外长提出了五项原则建议。这是总结了与会各国代表，包括大韩民国代表在内所已经取得一致和接近一致的意见而提出的。但是，这些建议竟又遭到美国代表和其他代表们的反对。由此可见，美国代表和追随美国的代表们是根本不愿意对和平统一朝鲜的问题达成任何协议的。事实上，早在本会议开始之前，美国政府某些有势力人士就已经公开宣布了不容许日内瓦会议成功的方针。日内瓦会议直到现在的发展证实了这一点。美国对日内瓦会议的阻挠政策是本会议至今不能达成协议的基本原因。
    主席先生，我们坚决认为，六月五日莫洛托夫先生关于和平统一朝鲜问题的五项原则建议是完全合理的。与会各国对于经由全朝鲜的自由选举实现朝鲜和平统一的问题现在还不能达成协议，这是令人十分遗憾的。全世界爱好和平的人民期待我们的会议能够对于和平解决朝鲜问题达成完满的协议。照目前会议的情形来看，尽管我们现在还不能对和平统一朝鲜的问题达成协议，我们也应该努力对巩固朝鲜和平的问题达成协议。为了朝鲜人民的利益，为了巩固远东及世界的和平，这是非常重要的。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相今天提出了关于保证朝鲜和平的六项建议，正好符合这种要求。中华人民共和国代表团完全支持南日外务相的建议。
    朝鲜停战了，举世为之欢欣鼓舞，认为这是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。我们之所以能够在这里开会，也就是因为朝鲜已经停止了战争和朝鲜的停战仍然有效的缘故。但是我必须指出，朝鲜的停战由于大韩民国政府不断叫嚣北进统一朝鲜，正在受到日益增长的威胁，而这种叫嚣，又得到了某些美国当权人士的响应。他们正在企图利用每一种可能来破坏朝鲜的停战协定。同时，朝鲜虽然停战了，但是停战的状态究竟还不是巩固的和平。我们应该努力使朝鲜的停战状态转入和平状态。因此，当我们对和平统一朝鲜问题一时尚不能取得协议的时候，我们就有义务采取措施来巩固朝鲜的和平，以便为和平统一朝鲜创造条件。
    为逐步解除朝鲜的军事状态，从朝鲜撤退一切外国武装力量是首要的条件。在朝鲜停战协定第六十款中曾经明文规定在停战后必须解决这一问题，有关各国负有执行这一规定的义务。中华人民共和国代表团完全同意一切外国武装力量于最短期限内按比例地从朝鲜境内撤退。由于战争的关系，大韩民国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的军队数量都有了大量的增加，这就给朝鲜人民带来了很重的负担。因此，为逐步解除军事状态并减轻朝鲜人民的负担，缩减双方军队的数量是完全必要的。但是，逐步解除军事状态并将双方军队恢复至和平状态的问题不是一个简单的问题，因此有必要由朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国的代表组成委员会负责考虑这类问题。同时，为了有利于促进朝鲜的和平统一，朝鲜的某一部分与其他国家签订的军事条约，如“美韩共同防御条约”，就不能被认为是可以容许的。
    为了创造朝鲜和平统一的条件，要求南北朝鲜能够互相接近起来，而不是继续对立下去。因此，由朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国双方代表组成全朝鲜委员会来协商有关双方之间的经济和文化联系的一些过渡措施是适当的和必需的。
    鉴于朝鲜停战现在仍然不是处于稳定的情况下，本会议与会各国有必要保证朝鲜的和平发展。
    根据以上所述，我们认为南日外务相的六项建议提供了保证朝鲜和平发展的基本条件。我们没有理由不可能在南日外务相提出的六项建议的基础上达成适当协议。为此，中华人民共和国代表团建议本会议召开中、苏、英、美、法、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国七国参加的限制性会议，讨论巩固朝鲜和平的有关措施。我们希望与会各国代表对于这个建议予以郑重的考虑。
