    Eleventh All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions Congress Opens
    By our correspondent Li He
    The Eleventh All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions Congress opened on the 7th in the Kremlin, Moscow. The Soviet working class and all the people regard this as a major event in their lives. This congress will summarize the work of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions in the five years since the last congress, stipulate the new tasks of the trade unions in the current stage of Soviet development, and formulate the guidelines for the trade unions' future participation in the nationwide effort to build a communist society. Trade union members from all over have sent their representatives and enthusiastically launched socialist emulation drives to celebrate the congress. Delegations of workers and trade unions from China and about forty countries around the world are participating in the congress. This demonstrates the love and admiration of the world's workers for the heroic Soviet working class and its trade unions.
      The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions is a leading force in the international workers' movement. It is constantly fighting for the unity of the world's working class, for peace and friendship among peoples of all countries, and for the easing of international tensions. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and relying on the initiative of the masses, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions plays a huge role in communist construction. As schools of communism, trade union organizations conduct regular education and organizational work among trade union members. They educate trade union members with a communist attitude towards labor and socialist property, and with the spirit of Soviet patriotism and proletarian internationalism. They mobilize trade union members to actively seek out production potential to fulfill the national construction plan. They are concerned with improving the material and cultural welfare of trade union members. It is precisely due to the direct efforts of trade union organizations with tens of millions of members that various competition movements across the Soviet Union—to further increase labor productivity, better utilize technical equipment, improve product quality, reduce product costs, and conserve raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity—are becoming increasingly widespread and in-depth. Since the Communist Party of the Soviet Union put forward the nationwide task of drastically increasing the production of daily necessities, further developing agriculture, and greatly increasing grain production, while not relaxing the development of heavy industry, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions has done a lot of work in mobilizing trade union members to realize the Party's policies.
    Prior to the convening of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions Congress, trade union organizations at all levels in the Soviet Union conducted reports and elections, and in the past two months, Soviet industrial trade unions held congresses. This prepared the way for this All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions Congress. All these meetings were conducted in an atmosphere of expanding criticism and self-criticism, and in an environment of promoting the high initiative of the trade union masses. As a result, many ways to improve work were put forward, and many advanced workers and activists were elected to the leading bodies of trade unions at all levels. For example, in the organization of the petroleum industry trade union, half of the new people were elected to participate in leadership.
    The Soviet industrial trade union congresses summarized the experience of trade unions in mobilizing the masses to realize the Party's policies. But the delegates attending these congresses focused their main attention on exposing and criticizing the shortcomings in the work of the trade unions. Boldly criticizing shortcomings in order to seek greater progress is an important feature of various Soviet meetings. At the industrial trade union congresses, everything that restricted the creativity and initiative of workers was sharply criticized. The delegates criticized the shortcomings in the leadership of socialist competition, in caring for the welfare of workers, and in the working methods of trade union organizations. In the leadership of socialist competition, the delegates pointed out that some trade union workers had forgotten the principles instructed by the Party, which is to work with people, support the initiatives of innovators, and promote their experience, and had committed the mistakes of formalism and bureaucratism, such as failing to promptly judge the results of competition and reward outstanding workers, failing to actively summarize and promote advanced experience, and not paying enough attention to workers' rationalization proposals. In implementing the Party's instructions—that caring for the people's welfare is the supreme principle of all work—the delegates pointed out that some trade union workers had not done enough, because Soviet trade union organizations have important responsibilities to supervise compliance with labor protection and technical safety, and to participate in supervising residential construction, public canteens, etc. In terms of working methods, the delegates pointed out that some trade union workers had replaced the principle of caring most about people, as instructed by the Party, with paperwork and bureaucratic methods. They proved that where there is more leadership on paper, there is a weakening of vital organizational work. They demanded that these trade union workers go down more to the lower-level organizations and to the workers. The Soviet industrial trade union congresses also reflected such a demand: that local Party committees pay more attention to local trade union organizations and regularly conduct work on trade union cadres.
      The Labor Daily's editorial on the 6th put it well: "The entire work of Soviet trade unions is built on the basis of the initiative and creativity of the masses, and is built on the basis of broad trade union democracy. The source of strength of Soviet trade unions lies in their connection with the masses and in the growth of the initiative and creativity of the masses." "The strength of Soviet trade unions, and the guarantee of their future success, lies in the wise leadership of the Party."

### 第十一届全苏工会代表大会开幕

    第十一届全苏工会代表大会开幕
    本报记者　李何
    全苏工会第十一届代表大会七日在莫斯科克里姆林宫开幕。苏联工人阶级、全体人民把这看作自己生活中的大事。这次代表大会将总结上次代表大会以来五年中全苏工会的工作，将规定工会在苏联发展现阶段的新任务，将制订工会此后参加建设共产主义社会的全民努力中的方针。各地职工都派出自己的代表，并且热烈展开祝贺代表大会的社会主义竞赛。中国和世界约四十个国家的工人和工会代表团参加代表大会。这表现了全世界劳动者对英雄的苏联工人阶级及其职工会的爱戴。
      全苏工会是国际工人运动中的带头力量，它为世界工人阶级的团结，为各国人民之间的和平和友好，为缓和国际的紧张局势，进行着不断的斗争。在苏联共产党领导之下，依靠着群众的积极性，全苏工会在共产主义建设中起着巨大的作用。作为共产主义学校的职工会组织在职工群众中进行着经常的教育工作和组织工作。它们以对劳动对社会主义财产的共产主义态度，以苏维埃爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义精神教育职工群众。它们动员职工群众积极寻找生产潜力，来完成国家建设计划。它们关心提高职工群众的物质和文化的福利。正是由于拥有几千万会员的工会组织的直接努力，苏联全国各种竞赛运动—进一步提高劳动生产率、更好地使用技术设备、提高产品质量、减低产品成本、节约原料材料燃料电力—日益广泛和深入着。自从苏联共产党提出在不放松发展重工业的同时，急剧增产日用品、进
  一步发展农业、大大提高谷物的生产的全民任务以来，全苏工会在动员职工实现党的政策上做了很多工作。
    在全苏工会代表大会举行之前，苏联各级职工会组织进行了报告和选举，最近两个月中苏联各产业工会都举行了代表大会。这样为这次全苏工会代表大会作了准备。所有这些会议都是在展开批评和自我批评的空气中，在发扬职工会群众的高度积极性的环境中进行的。因此提出了许多改进工作的办法，选出了许多先进工人和活动分子到各级职工会的领导机构中去。例如在石油工业工会的组织中，选出了一半新人参加领导。
    苏联各产业工会代表大会总结了职工会在动员群众实现党的政策中的经验。但是参加这些代表大会的代表们把主要的注意力放在揭发和批评职工会工作中的缺点上。勇敢地批评缺点以便求得更大的进步，这是苏联各种会议的重要特点。在各产业工会代表大会上，一切束缚劳动者的创造性、积极性的东西，受到了尖锐的批评。代表们批评了在社会主义竞赛的领导上，在关心职工福利上，在职工会机构的工作方法上的缺点。在社会主义竞赛的领导上，代表们指出了某些职工会工作者忘记了党所指示的原则，这就是要向人们进行工作，支持革新者的发起，推广他们的经验，而犯了形式主义、官僚主义的毛病，例如不及时评判竞赛成绩和奖励优胜职工，不积极总结和推广先进经验，不够注意工人的合理化建议。在实现党的指示——关心人民福利是所有工作的最高原则上，代表们指出了某些职工会工作者做得不够，因为苏联职工会组织负有监督遵守劳动保护、技术安全，参加监督住宅建筑、公共食堂等等重要责任。在工作方法上，代表们指出了某些职工会工作者以文牍主义、官僚主义的方法代替了党所指示的要最关心人的原则。他们证明纸上领导多的地方，活生生的组织工作便削弱了。他们要求这些职工会工作者更多地下到下层组织和职工中去。苏联各产业工会代表大会也反映了这样的要求：要求地方党委更多关心地方职工会组织，经常对职工会干部进行工作。
      “劳动报”六日的社论说得好：“苏联职工会全部工作是建筑在群众主动性和首创性的基础之上，是建筑在广阔的职工会民主的基础之上，苏联职工会的力量源泉在于和群众的联系，在于群众积极性和主动性的增长。”“苏联职工会的力量，它今后成功的保证，在于有党的英明领导。”
