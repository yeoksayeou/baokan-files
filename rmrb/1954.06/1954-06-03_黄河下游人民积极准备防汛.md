Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, June 2nd: The people in the lower reaches of the Yellow River are actively preparing for flood prevention. Since last winter, the people of Henan and Shandong provinces, who live in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, have been actively engaged in strengthening the dikes by repairing dikes, rectifying dangerous sections, conducting cone penetration tests, planting trees, and planting grass. The spring repair project of the dikes in various sections of the river in Henan Province has now been completed in terms of earthwork, and Shandong Province will also complete it before the flood season of the Yellow River arrives in June. At present, the Yellow River Conservancy Bureaus of Henan and Shandong provinces in the lower reaches of the Yellow River are holding flood prevention meetings to study this year's flood prevention plan. Flood prevention organizations at all levels are also about to be established. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission is studying the flood reporting methods with relevant units, and will establish more than 140 flood reporting stations on the main and tributary streams of the Yellow River in Gansu Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Shanxi Province, Shaanxi Province, Henan Province, Shandong Province and other places in the upper, middle and lower reaches to control the flood situation in the river basin and provide timely forecasts to the people of the provinces along the river.
