Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, 21st—The Yumen Mining Bureau has completed its first-half production plans ahead of schedule for five major products: gasoline, kerosene, light diesel, light machine oil, and heavy machine oil. Among them, light machine oil was completed earliest, on May 2nd, and light diesel was completed on June 12th. The quality of gasoline and kerosene both meet the planned requirements.
    The Yumen Mining Bureau's January plan had not been completed well; except for light diesel, light machine oil, and fuel oil, all products failed to meet the state plan. From February onwards, the oil mine workers vigorously reversed this situation. They implemented a tag-checking system in the refinery to maintain stable operation and safe production; they paid attention to improving the quality of furnace repairs, extending the refining time, and correspondingly increasing the amount of crude oil processed. From March to May, all major products completed or exceeded the production plan every month. The average daily completion rate of gasoline and kerosene reached 93 percent, which is better than the completion of the plan in the same period last year. At the same time, more than 400 technical innovation proposals put forward and implemented by refinery workers from January to May also played an important role in completing the plan for five major products ahead of schedule. For example, after Jiang Yufu, a worker in the third workshop, suggested increasing the flywheel diameter of the compressor, the operating speed of the compressor was accelerated, and the refrigeration capacity was increased. It is estimated that 90 tons more heavy machine oil can be produced this year.

    (This newspaper’s report) The Huainan Mining Bureau Drilling Engineering Team completed the state drilling plan for the first half of this year 24 days ahead of schedule on June 6th. In terms of quality, the national indicators were basically met. Compared with the same period last year, the coal core recovery rate increased by 97 percent, and the rock core recovery rate increased by 15 percent. Efficiency increased by 60 percent compared with the national plan, with an average drilling depth of 6 meters per drilling rig per day. In terms of cost, a total of 420 million yuan was saved from January to April. Fatal accidents were eliminated. The early completion of the team's drilling plan promptly provided well field design data and enabled the drilling work in another well field to be completed ahead of schedule.

    玉门油矿五种主要产品已完成上半年计划
    淮南矿务局钻探工程队上半年钻探计划提前完成
    【新华社玉门二十一日电】玉门矿务局汽油、煤油、轻柴油、轻机油和重机油等五种主要产品，上半年的生产计划都已提前完成。其中轻机油最先在五月二日完成，轻柴油在六月十二日完成。汽油和煤油的质量都合乎计划要求。
    玉门矿务局今年一月份的计划曾经完成得不好，一月份除轻柴油、轻机油和燃料油以外，各种产品都没有完成国家计划。从二月份起，油矿职工就大力扭转这种情况。他们在炼油厂推行了挂牌检查制度，保持平稳操作和安全生产；注意提高炼炉的检修质量，延长了开炼时间，并相应地提高了处理原油量。从三月份到五月份，各种主要产品都月月完成或超额完成生产计划。汽油和煤油每天完成计划的均衡率，平均都达到百分之九十三，这比去年同期完成计划的情况要好。同时，炼油工人从一月到五月份提出并实行的四百多件技术革新建议，也对提前完成五种主要产品计划起了重要的作用。如第三车间工人蒋玉福建议加大压缩机的飞轮直径后，就加快了压缩机的运转速度，提高了冷冻量，预计今年内就可多产重机油九十吨。
    【本报讯】淮南矿务局钻探工程队于六月六日提前二十四天完成了今年上半年国家钻探计划。在质量方面，基本上达到国家的指标，与去年同期相比较，煤芯采取率提高了百分之九十七，岩芯采取率提高了百分之十五；效率比国家计划提高了百分之六十，平均每天每台钻机钻进六公尺；在成本方面，一至四月份共节约了四亿二千万元；消灭了死亡事故。该队钻探计划提前完成，及时提出了井田设计资料，并使另一井田的钻探工程能提前完工。
