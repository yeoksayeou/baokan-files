State-Owned Department Stores in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Other Provinces
Cooperate with Agricultural Product Procurement to Strengthen Rural Supply Work
    Many department stores of the China Department Store Company in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Sichuan and other provinces are organizing a large number of industrial products to go to the countryside, in coordination with the procurement and pre-purchase of wheat and agricultural products. Due to the bumper harvests of wheat and agricultural crops such as tea and cocoons this year, the demand for industrial products from farmers has increased greatly, especially the sales volume of fabrics and knitwear, which have increased by two to three times compared with last year.

    Many department stores are using exhibition and sales methods to organize industrial products to go to the countryside. The Qishuyan Business Office of Changzhou Department Store in Jiangsu Province carried out a commodity exhibition in cooperation with the Caoqiao Cooperative during the temple fair. More than 30,000 farmers visited in two days, selling commodities worth 135 million yuan. Jinshi Department Store in Hunan Province went to the countryside for exhibition and sales, supplying daily necessities worth more than 130 million yuan to the countryside. Santai Department Store in Sichuan Province held a summer commodity exhibition, and sales increased by 47.79% in four days compared with usual.

    After organizing exhibitions and sales, the cooperatives felt that the variety of products they had been operating in the past was too small, and actively added new varieties. Liuqiao Town Cooperative in Nantong, Jiangsu Province, automatically purchased goods from department stores, adding more than 100 new varieties. Jiang'an Department Store in Hunan Province supplied cooperatives in the area, who previously believed that singlets and undershirts were not needed by farmers. This time, the department store went to the countryside to help promote sales, opened up sales channels, eliminated the conservative thinking of the cooperatives, and enabled state-owned commerce to closely combine with the cooperatives to organize a large number of industrial products to go to the countryside.

    In addition, department stores in various places correctly organized township peddlers and established wholesale and retail relationships. For example, Changzhou Department Store in Jiangsu took the initiative to contact vendors and organized them to prepare purchase plans for summer commodities such as singlets and undershirts. Pixian Department Store in Sichuan Province also organized wholesale private merchants to go to the countryside to promote sales, and the turnover generally increased by 60% to 70%. Many stores also held various forms of symposiums for private retailers and held commodity exhibitions to encourage private retailers to actively purchase goods and expand the supply of materials to the countryside.

    江苏浙江等省国营百货商店
    配合农产品收购加强农村供应工作
    中国百货公司江苏、浙江、湖南及四川省等地许多百货商店，配合小麦及农产品的收购和预购工作，组织大批工业品下乡。由于今年小麦和茶、茧等农作物丰收，农民对工业品的需求量增加很大，特别是对布疋及针棉织品等的销售量，都比去年增加一倍至三倍。
    许多百货商店采用展览推销的办法组织工业品下乡。江苏省常州百货商店戚墅堰营业所配合漕桥合作社赶庙会进行了商品展览，两天内参观的农民达三万多人，销售价值一亿三千五百万元的商品。湖南省津市百货商店下乡展览推销，供应农村价值一亿三千多万元的日用百货。四川省三台百货商店举行夏令商品展览会，四天内销售额比平日增加百分之四十七点七九。
    在组织展览推销后，合作社感到过去经营品种太少，积极增添了新的品种。江苏省南通刘桥镇合作社自动向百货商店进货，增添了一百多种新品种。湖南省江安百货商店供应区内的合作社过去都认为背心、汗衫农民不需要，这次百货商店下乡帮助推销，打开了销路，消除了合作社的保守思想，使国营商业能密切结合合作社，组织大批工业品下乡。
    此外，各地百货商店正确组织乡镇小贩，建立了批购零销关系。如江苏常州百货商店主动联系摊贩，组织他们编造了背心、汗衫等夏令商品的要货计划。四川省郫县百货商店还组织批购私商下乡推销，营业额普遍上升百分之六十到七十。许多商店还召开各种不同形式的私营零售商座谈会和举行了商品展览，鼓励私营零售商积极进货，扩大对农村物资的供应。　（王书田）
