    Strive for the Infinitely Bright Future of New China
    Wu Yaozong, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Protestant Churches of China
    This January, I participated in the general election in Shanghai and gloriously cast my vote, deeply savoring the feeling of being masters of our own house. Recently, I also participated in the discussion of the draft constitution, which not only made me feel proud as a Chinese, but also allowed me to see the infinitely bright future of the motherland. The Chinese people, who had long lived in darkness and suffering under imperialism and reactionary rule, will all issue joyous cries for the progress of the Chinese people's democratic cause. This is a dream of the Chinese people for thousands of years, but this dream is beginning to come true before our eyes today. We will no longer doubt that this is a "dream," because the facts of the past four years have made us clearly aware that we have embarked on the road to happiness. The leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao assures us that we will be able to fully achieve our infinitely bright future. The draft constitution clearly stipulates the basic rights and obligations of citizens. This is not an empty check, because there are guarantees beneath every "right" enjoyed by citizens. We know that this guarantee is reliable, because under the people's democratic system, these guarantees are bound to be realized. Therefore, our country will not be like the United States, which, while flaunting the "natural," "inalienable," "rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" of the American people, at the same time uses hypocritical democracy to implement the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, stripping these rights completely. The draft constitution stipulates that citizens have "freedom of religious belief," which is the most precious freedom for us religious believers. Capitalist countries call themselves Christian countries, and they also place articles on freedom of religious belief in their constitutions. However, in reality, their people do not have the freedom to believe in religion, because they cannot express any ideas against the reactionary ruling group based on their religious doctrines. The facts of the past four years in New China have proven that only the people's democratic system can truly guarantee freedom of religious belief. Some people think that the article on "freedom of religious belief" in the draft constitution is too brief and that it is necessary to add some supplementary articles. I don't think this is necessary. The important thing is how to implement the spirit of the article. On this point, we can fully trust the state under the leadership of the Communist Party. The draft constitution is the most reliable guarantee for the Chinese people to realize people's democracy. However, we must not forget that although the draft constitution on the one hand records the current actual situation of our country and reflects the great achievements we have already made in the past few years, on the other hand, it also fully expresses the fundamental requirement of our country's gradual transition to a socialist society, and expresses the efforts we must make to realize this requirement. Let us strive for the infinitely bright future of New China!

    为新中国无限美好的前途而奋斗
    中国基督教三自革新运动委员会筹备委员会主席  吴耀宗
    今年一月，我在上海参加了普选，光荣地投了一票，更深切地尝到当家作主的滋味。最近，我又参加了关于宪法草案的讨论，这不但使我感到作为一个中国人的光荣，也使我看到祖国无限光明的远景。曾经在帝国主义和反动统治下长期过着黑暗痛苦的日子的中国人民，都会为着中国人民民主事业的进展，发出欢乐的呼声。这是中国人民几千年来的梦想，然而这个梦想今天在我们面前开始实现了。我们不会再怀疑这是个“梦”，因为四年来的事实使我们清楚地知道：我们已经走上了幸福的道路。中国共产党和毛主席的领导，使我们确信我们必能完全达到我们无限美好的将来。宪法草案清楚规定了公民的基本权利和义务。这并不是空头支票，因为在公民享受的每一种“权利”下面都有着保证。我们知道，这个保证是可靠的，因为在人民民主制度下，这些保证必定能够实现。因此，我们的国家，就不会像美国那样，一面标榜着美国人民“天赋的”“不可剥夺的”“生存、自由、和追求幸福的权利”，而同时又利用虚伪的民主，实行资产阶级专政，把这些权利剥夺净尽。宪法草案规定了公民有“宗教信仰的自由”，这是我们宗教信徒所最宝贵的自由。资本主义国家自称为基督教国家，也同样地把宗教信仰自由的条文放在宪法里面，然而实际上，他们的人民是没有信仰宗教的自由的，因为他们不能根据教义，发挥任何反对反动统治集团的思想。新中国四年来的事实证明：只有人民民主的制度才能真正保证信仰宗教的自由。有人以为宪法草案中所规定的“宗教信仰的自由”的条文太过于简略，有增加一些补充条文的必要。我认为这是不需要的。要紧的却是怎样贯彻条文的精神。关于这一点，我们是可以完全信任在共产党领导下的国家的。宪法草案是中国人民实现人民民主最可靠的保证。然而我们不要忘记：虽然宪法草案一方面记录了我们国家现在的实际情况，反映了我们几年来所已经获得的伟大成就，但另一方面，它也充分地表达了我国逐步过渡到社会主义社会这一个根本要求，表达了我们为了实现这个要求所必须作的努力。让我们为新中国无限美好的前途而奋斗吧！
