In recent years, cultural departments at all levels of the government and trade union organizations at all levels have used various institutions such as cinemas, projection teams, theaters, clubs, and cultural centers, and tools such as films, dramas, books, and pictures to carry out cultural popularization work among the workers, and have extensively carried out amateur cultural and artistic activities for the workers. Significant results have been achieved in raising the working class's patriotic ideology and socialist consciousness, inspiring their labor production enthusiasm, and enlivening their cultural life. The activities of trade union film projection teams, the touring performances of professional theater troupes, song and dance troupes, and other artistic performance groups to factories and mines, and the guidance of literary and artistic workers to workers' amateur cultural and artistic activities have played a significant role. However, from the overall point of view, the existing work is far from meeting the requirements of the broad masses of workers, and the development of cultural and artistic activities in various factories and mines is still unbalanced, and there are still many serious shortcomings in the work. This is primarily manifested in the fact that a small number of government cultural departments and trade union organizations have failed to fully recognize that cultural and artistic work is a powerful weapon for carrying out communist education for the broad masses of workers, and therefore, they do not pay attention to, lead, or manage the development of cultural and artistic work for workers, leaving it to its own devices. There is a lack of unified planning and coordinated steps in the planning of undertakings and work facilities for cultural and artistic work in factories, mines, construction sites, and enterprises, resulting in the failure to use the existing cultural and artistic institutions and tools more rationally and to give full play to their effectiveness. Some cultural cadres have the idea of neglecting cultural work to serve the broad masses of workers, some cadres of cultural enterprises have a purely profit-making point of view, and some trade union work cadres have a one-sided emphasis on workers' welfare and neglect the principle of enterprise management in undertaking management. There is a lack of regular guidance and concrete assistance for workers' amateur cultural and artistic activities. In some places, it is even mistakenly believed that literary and artistic activities hinder production, and therefore a negative and restrictive attitude is adopted, or it is mechanically required that literary and artistic creations must reflect the production activities of the factory or mine, resulting in the narrow content and monotonous form of amateur artistic performance programs, which cannot achieve the due effect of art. The backbone elements in workers' amateur cultural and artistic activities and young people with artistic talents among the workers have also failed to be cultivated and improved in a planned manner.

    In order to overcome the above shortcomings and further strengthen workers' cultural and artistic work, government cultural departments at all levels and trade union organizations at all levels must first raise their awareness of the importance of workers' cultural work, strengthen the idea of cultural service for the broad masses of workers, and strengthen the unified planning and unified management of career plans and work facilities in workers' cultural and artistic work. Government cultural departments at all levels must include the collaborative development of cultural and artistic work in factories, mines, construction sites, and enterprises with trade union organizations at all levels as one of the main tasks, and provide active support and assistance to trade union organizations in relevant work. Government cultural departments at all levels and trade union organizations at all levels must fully and rationally use existing cultural and artistic institutions and tools to serve the workers, and develop amateur cultural and artistic activities for workers in a guided and planned manner, in order to meet the growing cultural needs of the workers, and further improve the socialist consciousness and production labor enthusiasm of the working class, and strive for the great task of the country's socialist industrialization. For this purpose, the following instructions are given.

    A. Government cultural departments at all levels and trade union organizations at all levels should, under the overall deployment of national cultural work, divide labor and cooperate, and make full use of all film projection teams, theaters, cinemas, cultural centers (stations), cultural palaces, clubs and other institutions to serve the workers.

    1. Government cultural departments should actively assist trade union organizations at all levels in developing and strengthening film projection work in factories and mines. First of all, supervise local film distribution agencies to earnestly improve the supply of films to trade union projection teams. Local film machinery repair factories (stations) should also be responsible for the machine repair and parts supply of trade union projection teams. When holding training classes for projectionists, trade unions should also be notified to send projectionists to participate in the study. For factories, mines, construction sites, and enterprises where the trade union projection force is insufficient, a method should be negotiated with the trade union to dispatch the affiliated projection team to perform projections in a planned manner, and charge fees in accordance with the principles of enterprise management. For large-scale basic construction sites far away from cities (such as large-scale water conservancy projects, road construction projects, etc.), when the administrative and trade union organizations of the construction site do not have a projection team or the projection team is insufficient, the affiliated projection team should be appropriately dispatched to conduct condolence performances, and the expenses shall be appropriately subsidized by the trade union organization or by consulting the administrative aspects of the construction site.

    2. The service objects of the trade union projection team are the workers, and should focus on industrial workers and basic construction workers. Trade union projection teams should generally carry out projections inside factories, mines, basic construction sites, enterprises, and concentrated workers' dormitories without cinemas or far away from cinemas, and should gradually establish fixed projection stations to achieve unified scheduling and planned projection. Trade union projection teams should generally implement enterprise management and gradually achieve self-sufficiency. The charging standard should generally not be lower than that of government cultural department projection teams. The business plan and management method of the trade union projection team shall be stipulated by the trade union organizations at all levels according to the specific circumstances of the local area. In addition to carrying out projections for the above-mentioned areas and objects, if there is surplus capacity, the trade union projection team can carry out projections for the general public, but it must abide by the unified regulations of the government cultural department on the operation and management of the projection team, and reasonably divide the work with the cinema and the government cultural department projection team to avoid duplication.

    3. Trade union organizations in each province and city should, according to the number of projection teams in the trade union system of the province and city, as well as the distribution of factories and mines and the number of workers, strengthen the unified leadership of the trade union projection teams in accordance with the "Instructions of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on Improving the Work of Trade Union Film Education Teams," and gradually achieve unified control of the development plan. In the future, except for the industrial trade union organizations of railways, the Second Ministry of Machine Building, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and salt industry, trade union organizations in various regions should formulate a unified development plan for projection teams on a provincial and municipal basis. When factories and mines establish projection teams, they must be approved by the provincial and municipal trade union organizations and reported to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for record; and the provincial (municipal) trade union organizations should consult the opinions of the provincial and municipal government cultural departments in advance so that they can be included in the unified scheduling, distribution, repair, and supply plan.

    4. The government cultural departments should focus on factory and mining areas in the development plan of cinemas and theaters. Existing cinemas and theaters should strengthen the work of organizing worker audiences. The cinemas and theaters taken over by trade union organizations in various places after liberation should, in principle, be transferred to the government cultural departments for operation and management. Those that have been converted into trade union clubs (including workers' cultural palaces) may not be transferred, but they should generally not be open to the public. If they are open to the public, they should abide by the unified regulations of the government cultural department on the operation and management of cinemas and theaters.

    5. State-owned theater troupes in various places should stipulate in the performance plan that they should go to factories and mines and basic construction sites for performances for a certain period of time each year. Government cultural departments should guide state-owned theater troupes and factory and mine, engineering departments or factory and mine cultural palaces (clubs) to sign performance contracts. The theater troupe should charge fees in accordance with the principles of enterprise management when going to factories and mines and construction sites for performances. When necessary, condolence performances can be organized appropriately. Travel expenses and necessary subsidies shall be borne by the local trade union organization or by consulting with the local factory and mine and construction site administrative departments. The local trade union should actively assist the theater troupe in the performance. For private professional theater troupes with better conditions, the government cultural department should also appropriately mobilize and organize them to perform in factories, mines, and basic construction sites.

    6. Cultural centers (stations) in various places should establish close contact with the trade union organizations in the area and do a good job in serving the workers in the area. A few large cities have district trade union clubs, which are similar in nature to cultural centers (stations). The local government cultural department should consult with the trade union organization to make appropriate adjustments in the organization or work to avoid duplication. If the two coexist, they should cooperate closely in their work. Provincial and municipal libraries, especially those with more factories and mines in the area, should strengthen the contact and cooperation with factory and mine and enterprise trade union libraries, and should help the library work cadres of trade union organizations to study their business; for factories and mines and enterprises without trade union libraries, they should strengthen the work of organizing workers to read. Libraries with conditions can try to send books to the workers. Trade union organizations should also pay attention to helping provincial and municipal libraries and Xinhua bookstores strengthen the supply of books and newspapers and organize reading activities.

    7. Government cultural departments at all levels should, according to needs and possibilities, work with trade union organizations and other relevant departments to establish small mobile cultural service teams to serve the workers of local large-scale basic construction sites.

    B. Government cultural departments at all levels and trade union organizations at all levels should fully value the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers in culture and art, and correctly guide and help the workers to carry out amateur cultural and artistic activities to enliven their cultural life.

    1. To carry out workers' amateur literary and artistic activities, we must first proceed from the needs and possibilities of the masses, strictly abide by the principle of amateurism, avoid wasting time and delaying work, and hinder production; we should establish various types of amateur artistic organizations, such as drama troupes, bands, choruses, dance teams, art groups, and literature groups, according to the specific conditions of different factories and mines and taking into account the different requirements of various objects. The content of the performance programs of amateur cultural and artistic activities should have an educational effect, and at the same time, it can meet the legitimate cultural and entertainment needs of the masses; do not limit the content of the performance programs to the narrow scope of reflecting the production deeds of the factory or mine, but should help the workers to study and understand the excellent literary and artistic works created by domestic and foreign writers and artists, and sing their excellent dramas, music, and dance. In terms of the form of singing, we should generally adopt artistic forms that are loved by the workers, easy to learn and do, and relatively short, but in factories and mines with conditions, we should not forcibly oppose the performance of large-scale programs regardless of the needs of the workers. We should actively, correctly guide, encourage, and help the creation and performance of the workers; we should pay attention to the correctness of the ideological content of the performance programs, and at the same time, we should help them continuously improve their artistic level.

    2. The leadership of workers' amateur cultural and artistic activities should be the responsibility of trade union organizations at all levels, and government cultural departments should assist and guide them in business. At the same time, we should also obtain the cooperation and assistance of relevant parties, such as the China New Democratic Youth League organizations in various places. Government cultural departments should work with literary and artistic groups to guide and assist literary and artistic workers to establish regular contact with the workers, organize writers and artists to meet with workers, organize writers and artists to create excellent works suitable for the needs of workers, especially works that can be provided to them for singing; trade union organizations should provide as much assistance and convenience as possible to writers and artists who work in factories; literary and artistic publications should pay attention to developing the work of worker correspondents and cultivating worker writers; supervise professional theater troupes to establish regular business guidance relationships with workers' amateur literary and artistic organizations, in order to cultivate typical examples, summarize experiences, and promote them; government cultural departments should also work with trade unions to hold performances, competitions, or awards for workers' amateur cultural and artistic activities to improve the level of workers' amateur cultural and artistic activities; and work with trade unions to set up workers' mass art schools or training classes, adopting the form of part-time study or short-term intensive training, to cultivate and improve the backbone elements in workers' amateur cultural and artistic activities and young people with special literary and artistic talents.

    It is hoped that the cultural departments of major administrative regions, provinces (cities), and the trade union organizations of industrial and mining enterprises in various provinces (cities) will deeply discuss and study the above items, and formulate practical and feasible specific implementation plans for implementation in accordance with the principles of this instruction and in combination with the specific conditions of the region and the factories, mines, construction sites, and enterprises.

    中央人民政府文化部、中华全国总工会
    关于加强厂矿、工地、企业中文化艺术工作的指示
    近几年来，政府各级文化主管部门与工会各级组织，通过电影院、放映队、剧场、俱乐部、文化馆等各种机构，运用电影、戏剧、书刊、图画等工具，向职工群众进行了文化普及工作，并大量地开展了职工群众的业余文化艺术活动，在提高工人阶级的爱国主义思想和社会主义觉悟、鼓舞他们的劳动生产热情和活跃他们的文化生活方面，获得了显著的成果。工会电影放映队的活动，专业剧团、歌舞团等艺术表演团体对厂矿的巡回表演和文艺工作者对职工业余文化艺术活动的辅导，起了很大的作用。但从整个看来，已有的工作还远不能适应广大职工的要求，各地工矿文化艺术活动的发展还不平衡，工作中还存在着不少严重的缺点。这首先表现在：少数政府文化主管部门和工会组织未能充分认识文化艺术工作是对广大工人群众进行共产主义教育的强大武器之一，因而，对开展职工文化艺术工作不加重视、不去领导、任其自流。对厂矿、工地、企业的文化艺术工作的事业计划和工作设施缺少统一部署、协同步调，致使现有文化艺术机构和工具未能更合理地加以使用，充分发挥其效能。在某些文化干部中有忽视文化工作为广大职工群众服务的思想，某些文化企业干部中存在着单纯营利的观点；某些工会工作干部中则存在着片面地强调职工福利的观点和在事业管理上忽视企业化经营的原则。对职工业余文化艺术活动缺乏经常的指导和具体的帮助。有的地方，甚至错误地认为文艺活动妨碍生产，因而采取消极限制的态度，或者机械地要求文艺创作都要表现本厂矿的生产活动，致使业余艺术表演的节目内容狭隘，形式单调，不能达到艺术应有的效果。对职工业余文化艺术活动中的骨干分子和职工群众中有艺术才能的青年，也未能有计划地予以培养和提高。
    为克服上述缺点，进一步加强职工文化艺术工作，政府各级文化主管部门与工会各级组织必须首先提高对职工文化工作的重要性的认识，加强文化为广大职工群众服务的思想，加强在职工文化艺术工作中的事业计划和工作设施上的统一计划和统一管理。政府各级文化主管部门必须将协同工会各级组织开展厂矿、工地、企业文化艺术工作列为主要任务之一，并在有关工作中对工会组织予以积极的支持和帮助。政府各级文化主管部门和工会各级组织必须充分合理地运用现有各种文化艺术机构和工具为职工群众服务，并有领导、有计划地开展职工业余文化艺术活动，借以满足职工群众日益增长的文化要求，并进一步提高工人阶级的社会主义觉悟和生产劳动热情，为国家的社会主义工业化的伟大任务而奋斗。为此，特作如下指示。
    甲、政府各级文化主管部门和工会各级组织，应在国家文化工作的整个部署下，分工合作，充分利用所有电影放映队、剧场、电影院、文化馆（站）、文化宫、俱乐部等机构为职工群众服务。
    一、政府文化主管部门应积极协助工会各级组织开展和加强工矿的电影放映工作。首先监督当地电影发行机构，切实改进对工会放映队的影片供应。各地电影机修理厂（站），并应负责工会放映队的机器检修和零件供应。在举办放映人员训练班时亦应通知工会抽派放映人员参加学习。对于工会放映力量不足的厂矿、工地、企业，应与工会商定办法，有计划地派遣所属放映队前去放映，并按照企业经营的原则实行收费。对于远离城市的大规模基本建设工地（如大规模的水利工程、筑路工程等），在该工地的行政方面和工会组织没有放映队或者放映队力量不足时，应适当地派遣所属放映队前去进行慰问演出，其费用由工会组织或商请该工地行政方面予以适当补助。
    二、工会放映队的服务对象是职工群众，并应以产业工人与基本建设工人为主要对象。工会放映队，一般应在厂矿、基本建设工地、企业内部及职工宿舍集中而无影院或距离影院较远地区进行放映，并应逐步建立固定放映站，做到统一排片和计划放映。工会放映队一般应实行企业经营，逐步做到自给自足，其收费标准一般不应低于政府文化部门放映队。凡尚未实行收费的放映队，应即积极创造条件准备实行收费。工会放映队的经营计划和经营管理方法，由工会各级组织根据当地具体情况规定。工会放映队除对上述地区和对象进行放映外，如有余力，可向一般群众进行放映，但必须遵守政府文化主管部门关于放映队经营管理的统一规定，并与电影院和政府文化部门放映队合理分工，以免互相重复。
    三、各省、市工会组织应根据本省、市所有工会系统放映队的数量，以及厂矿企业的分布和职工人数等情况，按照中华全国总工会“关于改善工会电影教育工作队的指示”，加强对于工会放映队的统一领导，并逐步做到统一掌握发展计划。今后除铁路、第二机械、农林水利与盐业几个产业工会组织外，各地工会组织均应以省、市为单位制定放映队的统一发展计划，各厂矿企业成立放映队时，必须经过省、市工会组织批准，报中华全国总工会备案；并应由省（市）工会组织事先征询省、市政府文化主管部门的意见，以便列入统一的排片、发行、修理、供应计划中。
    四、政府各级文化主管部门对影院、剧场的发展计划，应以厂矿地区为重点。现有影院、剧场应加强组织职工观众的工作。各地工会组织在解放后接管的影院、剧场，原则上应移交政府文化主管部门经营管理，其已改为工会俱乐部者（包括工人文化宫），可不移交，但一般不应对外营业，如对外营业时，应遵守政府文化主管部门关于影院、剧场经营管理的统一规定。
    五、各地国营剧团在演出计划中，应规定每年有一定时间到厂矿和基本建设工地演出。政府文化主管部门应指导所属国营剧团和厂矿、工程部门或厂矿的文化宫（俱乐部）订立演出合同。剧团赴厂矿、工地演出时应按照企业经营的原则实行收费。必要时可适当组织慰问演出。旅费及必需的补助由当地工会组织担负，或商请当地厂矿、工地行政方面担负。当地工会应对剧团演出积极加以协助。条件较好的民间职业剧团，政府文化主管部门亦应适当动员和组织其到厂矿及基本建设工地演出。
    六、各地文化馆（站）应与所在地区的工会组织取得密切联系，做好为所在地区职工群众服务的工作。个别大城市设有区工会俱乐部，其性质与文化馆（站）相类似，应由当地政府文化主管部门商同工会组织在机构或工作上加以适当调整，以避免重复现象，如两者并存，则应在工作上取得密切的配合。省、市图书馆，特别是所在地区有较多厂矿企业的图书馆，应加强与厂矿、企业的工会图书馆的联系与配合，并应帮助工会组织的图书馆工作干部学习业务；对没有工会图书馆的厂矿、企业，则应加强组织职工阅读的工作。有条件的图书馆，可试办把图书送到职工群众中去的工作。工会组织也应注意帮助省、市图书馆及新华书店加强书报的供应和组织阅读的工作。
    七、政府各级文化主管部门应根据需要与可能，会同工会组织及其他有关部门，成立小型的文化流动服务队，为当地大规模基本建设工地的职工服务。
    乙、政府各级文化主管部门和工会各级组织，应充分重视职工群众在文化艺术上的积极性和创造性，正确地指导和帮助职工群众开展业余文化艺术活动，以活跃他们的文化生活。
    一、开展职工业余文艺活动，首先应根据群众的需要和可能，严格遵守业余的原则，避免旷时误工，妨害生产；应根据不同厂矿的具体情况，照顾各种对象的不同要求，建立各种类型的业余艺术组织，如剧团、乐队、合唱队、舞蹈队、美术小组、文学小组等。业余文化艺术活动演出节目的内容，应具有教育的作用，同时能满足群众正当文化娱乐的要求；不要把演出节目的内容限制在表现本厂矿的生产事迹的狭小范围内，而应帮助职工群众学习和理解本国和外国作家、艺术家所创造的优秀的文学艺术作品，演唱其优秀的戏剧、音乐和舞蹈。在演唱形式上，一般应采用职工群众所喜爱的、易学易做的、较为短小的艺术形式，但在具有条件的厂矿，也不要不顾职工需要而硬性地反对演出大型节目。对职工群众的创作和表演，应积极地、正确地加以指导、鼓励和帮助；既应注意其演出节目思想内容的正确，同时又应注意帮助其不断提高艺术水平。
    二、对职工业余文化艺术活动的领导，应由工会各级组织负责，政府文化主管部门在业务上加以协助和辅导，同时并应取得有关方面如各地中国新民主主义青年团组织等在工作上的配合和协助。政府文化主管部门应会同文艺团体指导和协助文艺工作者建立与职工群众的经常联系，组织作家、艺术家与工人见面，组织作家、艺术家创作适合于职工需要的优秀作品，特别是能供给他们演唱的作品；工会组织对下厂工作的作家、艺术家应尽可能给予工作上的帮助和便利；文艺刊物应注意开展工人通讯员与培养工人作家的工作；督促各专业剧团有重点地与职工业余文艺组织建立经常的业务辅导关系，用以培养典型，总结经验，加以推广；政府文化主管部门并应协同工会组织举办职工业余文化艺术活动的会演、竞赛或评奖，以提高职工业余文化艺术活动的水平；并协同工会举办职工群众艺术学校或训练班，采取业余学习或短期集训的方式，培养和提高职工业余文化艺术活动中的骨干分子和具有特别文学艺术才能的青年。
    以上各项，望各大行政区、省（市）文化主管部门和各省（市）工矿、企业的工会组织深入讨论研究，并根据本指示的原则，结合本地区及厂矿、工地、企业的具体情况，共同制订切实可行的具体实施方案予以执行。
