Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 4th:

Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, delivered a summary report on the work of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party and the political situation in France at the Thirteenth National Congress of the French Communist Party.

Duclos first pointed out that the French Communist Party had gloriously completed its tasks in the resolute struggle against war, poverty, and reactionary policies, and he spoke of the consequences of France's submission to American imperialism. Duclos analyzed the development from the "Marshall Plan" to the North Atlantic Treaty and the "European Army," and he pointed out that the North Atlantic Treaty orchestrated by Washington was very similar to the "Anti-Comintern Pact" that led to the Second World War.

Duclos explained the main stages of American imperialist policy. This policy was manifested in the Korean War, in hostile actions against the People's Republic of China, and in the establishment of a network of American military bases on the territories of other countries aimed at launching a new world war. The purpose of the US government is to revive German militarism under the guise of the "European Defense Community." Duclos said that the plan of American imperialism is to revive Hitler's Wehrmacht to re-ignite the war that Hitler lost. The proponents of this policy believe that it is necessary to revive German militarism under the guise of "Europe." This disguise encourages Nazi revanchists and is part of the military plan of the American ruling clique, which has long been trying to build aggressive forces against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies.

Duclos said that American imperialists are demanding that France ratify the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, and they want to use these treaties not only to build Nazi revanchist forces, but also to ensure that they can control France when necessary. The "European Defense Community" is a serious threat to European peace. As for France, the "European Defense Community" has simply become a question of whether France can exist as an independent power. The "European Defense Community" is to reduce our country to the position of a vassal state of American and West German Nazi revanchists.

Duclos emphasized that American imperialists hope to continue the Indochina War. They are concerned that the easing of international tensions will cause them economic difficulties. Therefore, after being forced to stop military operations in Korea, the Washington rulers hope to continue the war in Vietnam in order to maintain a source of war in Vietnam so that they can expand the war in Asia.

Duclos turned to the economic situation in France. He said that since 1947, the aim of the policy of American imperialists has been to undermine the economic foundations of French national independence. American monopoly capital economically enslaves France, with the result that French coal production decreases year by year. Since 1947, seventy-five coal pits across the country have been closed, and the number of workers in the coal mining industry has decreased from 338,000 to 238,000. According to the "Schuman Plan," the two coal regions of the Strait of Calais and Nord alone will reduce the number of coal pits from 115 in 1946 to 73 in 1956. This measure will also be implemented in the central and southern coal regions of France. There are also plans to transfer labor to the eastern French coal region, and even to other countries.

American monopoly capital has also placed other industrial sectors of France under its control.

This policy of economically subordinating France to American monopoly capital is undermining French finances, creating constant deficits and large national debts, and deepening the militarization of the French economy. The material conditions of the working people are deteriorating day by day. Since September 1951, the cost of living has risen by more than 20%, and real wages have fallen by 10%. The real wages of workers are now less than 50% of the 1938 level. The number of unemployed continues to grow. According to official figures, the number of unemployed has increased by 60% since 1951. Currently, there are 600,000 unemployed people in France, of whom only 10% can receive unemployment benefits. The number of unemployed is particularly high in the textile, leather, paper, and other processing industries.

The living conditions of French farmers are also very harsh. From 1949 to 1954, the purchasing power of farmers decreased by 10%. The proportion of agriculture in the national income was 25.4% in 1947-1948, while it fell to 14.2% in 1952-1953. French farmers bear a heavy tax burden they cannot cope with.

The profound crisis in the French economy means that France's current production capacity can only be used at 70%, and 15 to 20% of that is for military production. The actual volume of French industrial production has not increased in nearly 25 years.

In 1949, the level of industrial production in France and West Germany was the same. In 1953, West German production had exceeded the French level by 40%. Duclos said: From this, it can be seen that the policies implemented in France over the past seven years have weakened France and left it isolated in the face of the revived German imperialism.

Duclos then pointed out that the policy of serving the interests of American capital has led to the fascistization of the systems of many European countries. In France, the infringement of freedom of the press, the infringement of the rights to march, demonstrate, assemble and petition, the infringement of the rights of workers and trade unions, the infringement of the rights to strike, political asylum, and universal suffrage, and the infringement of freedom of cultural exchange and freedom of the press have become characteristics of reactionary measures. After analyzing the policy of colonial oppression, Duclos spoke of the strengthening of the conspiracies of the French reactionaries, who are persecuting people with progressive political beliefs, persecuting members of the Communist Party, and also making anti-democratic revisions to the electoral system and preparing to further amend the constitution to benefit the various right-wing parties in France.

Duclos said that therefore, our party must resolutely strive to establish the unity of action of the working class and unite all national and democratic forces to smash the plans to fascistize the country.

Duclos discussed the economic achievements of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and emphasized the enormous growth of peaceful forces on the international stage. Then, he discussed in detail the struggle of the French people for peace and national security.

Duclos pointed out that Communists face many tasks in the struggle for national independence and peace, for bread and freedom. Duclos mentioned that the first task is to oppose the ratification of the Bonn and Paris military treaties that are preparing for the establishment of the "European Defense Community." Duclos said: The "European Defense Community" is not only to revive German militarism and eliminate French national independence, but also a serious threat to peace and our country's security. If the "European Defense Community" treaty is ratified, France will not even have the autonomy to decide on the length of service and military expenditures.

Duclos said that ratifying the "European Defense Community" treaty is an act of selling out national interests. According to the terms of the "European Army" treaty, once a war breaks out due to some provocation by the West German revanchist group, France will automatically stand on the side of West Germany. The future of France as an independent and free country is under threat, because the question of the "European Defense Community" is the decisive issue of French policy. Therefore, it is necessary to increase efforts to oppose the "European Defense Community" treaty.

In order to prevent the ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty and win the victory of changing French policy that the whole country eagerly desires, we must strive to unite and fight together with those who, like us, hope to prevent the revival of German militarism.

Duclos contrasted the "European Defense Community" treaty with the draft treaty on Pan-European collective security proposed by the Soviet Union, which could ensure European peace.

Duclos said that another task of the French Communist Party at present is to strive for the full restoration of the effectiveness of the 1944 Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance, because this treaty is an important condition for maintaining French national independence. At the same time, he called for intensifying the struggle for the recognition of the People's Republic of China. He said that it is necessary to expand the struggle of the working people to immediately prevent the Indochina War.

Duclos said that the United States is demanding that France send new troops. The French government's decision to keep soldiers who should be demobilized in the army, to conscript certain reservists, and to conscript new recruits ahead of schedule shows that if the masses do not raise strong protests, the French rulers will send new soldiers, even regular troops, to Indochina.

Duclos called on French Communists to do their best to support the struggle of the people in colonial countries for national liberation. He exposed the American plan to squeeze France out of North Africa, and emphasized that for this reason, the contradictions between France and the United States are becoming more acute.

Duclos said that in domestic policy, the task of the French Communist Party is to expand the struggle to satisfy the demands of the working class. Duclos called on Communists not only to fight for the improvement of the material conditions of the working people, but also to fight for the protection of national industrial sectors. Due to the American imperialist policy of economically enslaving France, national industrial sectors have been threatened.

Duclos said that the French Communist Party firmly supports the following demands of the working masses: universal increases in wages, pensions, and subsidies, the abolition of wage limits, satisfaction of the demands of veterans, war victims, the unemployed, and elderly workers, the protection of national industries sacrificed due to American competition, and the struggle against the "Schuman Plan" and its fatal consequences.

Duclos also spoke of the need to do everything possible to protect French farmers and improve the conditions of French agriculture, and he called for strengthening the Communist Party's work among intellectuals.

Duclos said that in order to establish the united front of the working class, the basic conditions are to abandon the policies that are leading France to collapse, enslavement, and poverty, to stop the ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty, and to stop the war in Indochina. In recent years, unity of action has been achieved not only on the basis of struggling to meet the demands of the working people, but also in defending democratic freedoms, opposing government persecution, striving for peace in Indochina, and opposing the arming of Germany, as well as in the election campaign. However, in addition to the achievements made in this regard, there are also shortcomings, especially in establishing unity of action among the grassroots masses.

Duclos said that we should consistently adopt a friendly attitude towards the working people who participate in the Socialist Party, and patiently and persistently attract them to our side. It is necessary to strive to establish a united front with the working people who participate in the Socialist Party and expose the treacherous policy of the leaders of the Socialist Party in maintaining the interests of the French bourgeoisie and American imperialism.

Jacques Duclos emphasized that clear evidence of the anti-national policy of the Socialist Party's leadership is the resolution of the recent special congress of the Socialist Party, which instructed Socialist Party members of parliament to vote in favor of ratifying the Paris Treaty.

Duclos called for persistent implementation of the policy of unified action, especially in those provinces where the Socialist Party's provincial committees oppose the establishment of the "European Army" and the arming of West Germany.

Duclos called on French Communists to lead all forces that oppose the establishment of the "European Army" and oppose the enslavement of France. Duclos pointed out that the contradictions within the imperialist camp are developing increasingly, and some of the French bourgeoisie hope to break away from the embrace of the United States and safeguard their independent position. Duclos said: The party must do its best to unite all the forces in the country around itself, so that France can break free from American control and stop the revival of German militarism, which poses a fatal threat to our country.

Duclos then pointed out the need for the Communist Party to carry out work among the peasants and the urban petty bourgeoisie. He said that although the urban petty bourgeoisie is influenced by the big bourgeoisie and the Social Democrats, they are a great force and are increasingly inclined to demand a change in the current policies. They are inclined to strive for peace and national independence, to oppose the rearmament of West Germany under the guise of the "European Defense Community," and to demand an end to the Indochina War.

Duclos went on to say that although the anti-communist movement of the French bourgeoisie has become increasingly rampant in recent years and the government has adopted a policy of suppression, the influence and prestige of the Communist Party among the working masses has been consolidated. Although the policy of splitting the trade union movement has weakened the working class, it has not been able to destroy the main trade union organization of the working people – the French General Confederation of Labor. Although the results of electoral fraud have deprived the Communist Party of eighty parliamentary seats, it has not, as the French bourgeoisie intended, driven the Communists out of parliament.

Duclos said that our party has made mistakes and endured difficulties, and the enemies of the working class have tried their best to lead the Communist Party astray. The actions of Marty and Lecoeur are proof of this. As a result of the events of February 12th and May 23rd, 1952, there appeared within our party the danger of underestimating the true significance of the strength of our people, and the one who represented this underestimation was Lecoeur.

Duclos pointed out that sectarianism has more than once manifested itself as an attempt to refuse to carry out work among the working masses in order to create the necessary conditions for the realization of unity of action.

Duclos firmly criticized the conciliatory attitude adopted towards opportunists. He called for strengthening ideological work to prevent the enemies of the working class from infiltrating the ranks of the French Communist Party. Duclos called on Communists to remain vigilant in this regard at all times and to fight against spies and provocateurs sent into the party.

Duclos pointed out that whether the Communist Party can victoriously achieve its tasks depends on the extent to which its position in industrial enterprises is consolidated. He said that it is necessary to abide by Lenin's principles of the party's collective leadership and correct selection of cadres.

Duclos spoke of the party's work in mass organizations and trade unions, calling on Communists to do their best to improve their ideological and theoretical level and to study Marxist-Leninist theory.

Duclos finally said that the interests of France and peace require a thorough change in the current policies, so that our country can break free from American control, pursue policies in all aspects that conform to the will of the people, and stop the implementation of the military plans of American imperialists and German revanchists. Today, the Communist Party stands at the forefront of the struggle for national independence and peace.

Our pride and meaning in life lies in the fact that we are activists of the French Communist Party, which maintains the legacy of great traditions and expresses the great national aspirations;

Our pride and meaning in life lies in the fact that we are activists of the French Communist Party, which unswervingly holds high the banner of patriotism and proletarian internationalism at the most difficult moments;

Our pride and meaning in life lies in the fact that we are activists of a French Communist Party that always believes in the final victory of socialism, and fights for the unity of action of the working class, for uniting national and democratic forces to strive for the implementation of a policy of national independence, peace and harmony among all peoples.

### 在法国共产党第十三次代表大会上  杜克洛作关于法共中央的工作和法国的政治情况的总结报告

    在法国共产党第十三次代表大会上
    杜克洛作关于法共中央的工作和法国的政治情况的总结报告
    法国共产党中央委员会书记雅克·杜克洛在法国共产党第十三次代表大会上作了关于法国共产党中央委员会的工作和法国的政治情况的总结报告。
    杜克洛首先指出，法国共产党在反对战争、贫困和反动的政策的坚决斗争中光荣地完成了它的任务，他谈到法国屈从美国帝国主义所造成的后果。杜克洛分析了从“马歇尔计划”到北大西洋公约和“欧洲军”发展的经过，他指出，华盛顿所主使的北大西洋公约很像导致发生第二次世界大战的“反共产国际公约”。
    杜克洛阐明了美国帝国主义政策的几个主要阶段。这种政策表现在朝鲜战争上，表现在对中华人民共和国的敌意行动上，表现在在其他国家的领土上建立旨在发动新的世界大战的美国军事基地网上。美国政府的目的是要在“欧洲防务集团”的幌子下复活德国军国主义。杜克洛说，美国帝国主义的计划是要复活希特勒的国防军以重新挑起希特勒打输了的那场战争。这一政策的推行者认为必须在“欧洲”的招牌的掩护下复活德国军国主义。这种伪装鼓舞着纳粹复仇主义者，它是美国统治集团的军事计划的一部分，美国统治集团长期以来竭力建立反对苏联和人民民主国家的侵略军队。
    杜克洛说，美国帝国主义者要求法国批准波恩条约与巴黎条约，他们想借助这些条约不仅建立纳粹复仇军，而且保证在必要时可以驾驭法国。“欧洲防务集团”是对于欧洲和平的严重威胁。而对于法国，“欧洲防务集团”简直就成为法国能否作为一个独立的大国而存在的问题了。“欧洲防务集团”是要把我们国家降低到美国和西德纳粹复仇主义者的仆从国的地位。
    杜克洛着重说，美国帝国主义者希望继续印度支那战争。他们耽心，国际紧张局势的缓和将造成他们的经济困难，因此，华盛顿统治者在被迫停止朝鲜的军事行动以后，就希望在越南继续战争，为的是在越南保持一个战争策源地，以使他们有可能在亚洲扩大战争。
    杜克洛转而谈到法国的经济情况。他说，从一九四七年起，美帝国主义者的政策的目的就是要破坏法国民族独立的经济基础。美国垄断资本从经济上奴役法国，结果法国煤的开采量一年比一年减少。自一九四七年以来全国有七十五个煤坑停了业，煤矿工业工人的数目从三十三万八千人减少到二十三万八千人。按照“舒曼计划”仅加来海峡与诺尔两个煤区就要把煤坑从一九四六年的一百一十五个减少到一九五六年的七十三个。在法国中部与南部各煤区也要实行这种措施。并且还计划要把劳动力转移到法国东部煤区，甚至别的国家。
    美国垄断资本还把法国其他的工业部门置于自己的控制之下。
    这种使法国在经济上从属于美国垄断资本的政策破坏着法国的财政，造成经常的赤字和大量的国债，并加深着法国经济的军事化。劳动人民群众的物质状况在一天天恶化。从一九五一年九月起，生活费上涨了百分之二十多，实际工资已降低了百分之十。现在劳动者的实际工资不及一九三八年水平的百分之五十。失业人数在继续增长。根据官方的材料，自一九五一年以来失业人数增加了百分之六十。目前法国的失业人数达六十万人，其中仅有百分之十的人可领到失业补助金。在纺织、皮革、造纸及其他一些加工工业部门中的失业人数尤其多。
    法国农民的生活条件也是非常恶劣的。从一九四九年到一九五四年这段时期中，农民的购买力降低了百分之十。一九四七—一九四八年农业在国民收入中所占的比重是百分之二十五点四，而一九五二—一九五三年下降到了百分之十四点二。法国农民力不胜任地肩负着沉重的赋税。
    法国经济中的深刻的危机现象使得法国目前的生产能力只能动用百分之七十，而且其中有百分之十五到二十是在搞军事生产。近二十五年来法国工业生产实有量并未增加。
    一九四九年法国与西德的工业生产水平是相同的，在一九五三年西德的生产已超过了法国的水平百分之四十。杜克洛说：由此可见，近七年来法国所实施的政策削弱了法国并使它在复活起来的德国帝国主义之前处于孤立地位。
    杜克洛接着指出：服从美国资本的利益的政策使许多欧洲国家的制度法西斯化。而在法国，侵害出版自由，侵害游行示威、集会与请愿的权利，侵害工人与工会的权利，侵害罢工、政治避难的权利及普遍的选举权，侵害文化交流自由与新闻自由，已成为反动的措施的特点。杜克洛在分析了殖民压迫的政策之后，谈到了法国反动派的阴谋的加强，他们在迫害有进步的政治信仰的人，迫害参加共产党的人，他们还对选举制度作反民主的修改并准备进一步修改宪法，使之有利于法国各右翼政党。
    杜克洛说，因此，我们党必须坚决努力建立工人阶级的行动统一和团结一切民族与民主力量，以粉碎使国家法西斯化的计划。
    杜克洛论述了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营在经济上所取得的成就，并着重指出了国际舞台上和平力量的巨大增长，接着他详细地论述了法国人民为和平与本国安全的斗争。
    杜克洛指出：共产党员在为民族独立与和平，为面包与自由的斗争中面临着许多任务，杜克洛提到第一位的任务是反对批准为建立“欧洲防务集团”作准备的波恩与巴黎军事条约。杜克洛说：“欧洲防务集团”不只是要复活德国的军国主义和消灭法国的民族独立，它并且是和平与我国安全的严重威胁。如果批准“欧洲防务集团”条约，法国就连决定服役期限和军费的自主权都没有了。
    杜克洛说，批准“欧洲防务集团”条约就是出卖民族利益的行为。根据“欧洲军”条约的条款，一旦由于西德复仇集团的某种挑衅而发生战争，法国就自动地站在西德的一边。法国作为一个独立自由的国家的前途正受到威胁，因为“欧洲防务集团”的问题是法国政策的决定性问题。因此，必须更加大力反对“欧洲防务集团”条约。
    为了阻止批准“欧洲防务集团”条约，获得举国所殷望的改变法国政策的胜利，我们必须竭力把和我们一样希望阻止德国军国主义复活的人们团结起来，共同奋斗。
    杜克洛把“欧洲防务集团”条约和可以确保欧洲和平的苏联所提出的全欧集体安全条约草案作了对比。
    杜克洛说，法国共产党当前的任务中还有一项任务，就是争取充分恢复一九四四年法苏同盟互助条约的效力，因为这个条约是维护法国民族独立的重要条件。他同时号召加紧为承认中华人民共和国的斗争。他说，必须扩大劳动人民争取立即防止印度支那战争的斗争。
    杜克洛说，美国要求法国派遣新的军队。法国政府决定把应予复员的军人留在军队，征召某些后备军人，提前征召新兵，从这些事实中可以看出，如果人民群众不提出强有力的抗议，法国统治者就要向印度支那派遣新的士兵，甚至派遣正规军。
    杜克洛号召法国共产党员尽力支持殖民地国家的人民争取民族解放的斗争。他揭穿美国把法国排挤出北非的计划，并着重说：由于这个缘故使得法美的矛盾趋于尖锐化。
    杜克洛说，在国内政策方面，法国共产党的任务是扩大争取满足工人阶级要求的斗争。杜克洛号召共产党员不仅为改善劳动人民的物质条件而斗争，而且要为保护民族工业部门而斗争。由于美国帝国主义在经济上奴役法国的政策，民族工业部门已受到威胁。
    杜克洛说，法国共产党坚决拥护劳动群众的下列要求：普遍增加工资、养老金和补助金，取消工资限额，满足退伍军人、战争受害者、失业者和老年工人的要求，保护由于美国的竞争而遭到牺牲的民族工业，为反对“舒曼计划”及其致命的后果而斗争。
    杜克洛还讲到必须尽力保护法国农民和改善法国农业的状况，他号召加强共产党在知识分子中间的工作。
    杜克洛说，为了建立工人阶级的统一阵线，基本的条件就是放弃使得法国走向崩溃、被奴役和贫困的政策，制止批准“欧洲防务集团”条约和停止印度支那的战争。最近几年，不仅在为满足劳动人民的要求而斗争的基础上实现了行动的统一，而且在保卫民主自由、反对政府迫害、争取印度支那的和平和反对武装德国的斗争的过程中以及在竞选的过程中，也都实现了行动的统一。但是，除了在这方面所获得的成就以外，还有着缺点，特别是在基层群众中建立行动的统一这方面有些缺点。
    杜克洛说，我们应当一贯对参加社会党的劳动人民采取友好的态度，要有耐心地和坚持不懈地把他们吸引到自己这一方面来。要争取与参加社会党的劳动人民建立统一阵线，揭穿社会党领导人维护法国资产阶级和美国帝国主义的利益这种卖国政策。
    雅克·杜克洛着重说，社会党领导机构反民族政策的明显证据，就是社会党最近特别代表大会责成社会党议员投票赞成批准巴黎条约的决议。
    杜克洛号召在那些社会党的省委会反对建立“欧洲军”和武装西德的省份中，尤其要坚持不懈地执行统一行动的政策。
    杜克洛号召法国共产党员领导一切反对建立“欧洲军”、反对奴役法兰西的力量。杜克洛指出，帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾日益发展，法国部分资产阶级希望脱离美国的怀抱，保障自己的独立地位。杜克洛说：党必须尽力将全国的一切力量团结在自己的周围，使法国摆脱美国的控制，制止对我国具有致命威胁的德国军国主义的复活。
    杜克洛接着指出了共产党在农民和城市小资产阶级中进行工作的必要性。他说，城市小资产阶级虽然受大资产阶级和社会民主党的影响，但他们是一种巨大的力量，愈来愈倾向于要求改变目前的政策。倾向于争取和平与民族独立、反对在“欧洲防务集团”的幌子下重新武装西德、要求停止印度支那战争。
    杜克洛接着说，虽然近几年来法国资产阶级的反共运动日益猖狂以及政府采取了镇压的政策，共产党在劳动群众中的影响和威信仍然得到了巩固。分裂工会运动的政策虽然削弱了工人阶级，但并没有能够摧毁劳动人民的主要工会组织——法国总工会。选举舞弊的结果虽然剥夺了共产党八十个议会席位，但没有像法国资产阶级所打算的那样，将共产党员排挤出议会。
    杜克洛说，我们党犯过错误并经受过困难，工人阶级的敌人曾竭力要把共产党引入歧途。马尔梯和勒戈尔的行为就是证明。一九五二年二月十二日和五月二十三日的事件的结果，在我们党的队伍内出现了对我国人民力量的真正意义估计不足的危险，而代表这种估计不足的观点的就是勒戈尔。
    杜克洛指出，宗派主义不止一次地表现为企图拒绝在劳动群众中进行工作以为实现行动的统一创造必需的条件。
    杜克洛坚决地批评了对机会主义者所采取的调和的态度。他号召加强思想工作，以阻止工人阶级的敌人钻入法国共产党的队伍。杜克洛号召，共产党员在这方面应经常保持警惕，与被派进到党内的奸细和挑拨分子进行斗争。
    杜克洛指出共产党能否胜利地实现它的任务，取决于它在工业企业中的地位巩固的程度。他说，必须遵守列宁关于党的集体领导和正确地选拔干部的原则。
    杜克洛谈到党在群众组织和工会中的工作，号召共产党员尽力提高思想理论水平，研究马克思—列宁主义理论。
    杜克洛最后说：法国与和平的利益要求彻底改变目前的政策，以便使我们国家摆脱美国的控制，在一切方面奉行符合人民意志的政策，制止美国帝国主义者和德国复仇主义分子的军事计划的实现。今天，共产党站在争取民族独立与和平的斗争的最前列。
    我们生活的骄傲和意义就在于：我们是维护伟大的传统的遗产和表达伟大的民族愿望的法国共产党的活动分子；
    我们生活的骄傲和意义就在于：我们是在最困难的关头不屈不挠地高举着爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义旗帜的法国共产党的活动分子；
    我们生活的骄傲和意义就在于：我们是这样一个法国共产党的活动分子，它始终相信社会主义的最后胜利，为工人阶级的行动的一致、为团结民族和民主力量以争取实行民族独立、和平与各国人民之间的和睦的政策而斗争。
