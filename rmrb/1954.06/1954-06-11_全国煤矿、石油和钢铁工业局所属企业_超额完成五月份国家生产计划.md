Enterprises Under the National Coal Mine, Petroleum, and Iron and Steel Industry Bureau
Exceed May's National Production Plan

[This Newspaper] On the basis of continuing to strengthen planned management, focusing on implementing the factory director responsibility system and the production area management system, state-owned coal mines nationwide exceeded the national production plan for May by 2.8 percent. Among them, except for the Southwest region, which only completed 92.1 percent of the planned task, state-owned coal mines in other major administrative regions completed the plan very well: the Northeast region and the North China region each exceeded by 3 percent, the East China region exceeded by 1.8 percent, the Central South region exceeded by 3.5 percent, and the Northwest region exceeded by 10.7 percent.

During the production in April and May, state-owned coal mines in major administrative regions paid attention to grasping the weak links in production and promptly put forward improvement measures to continuously improve the level of enterprise management and meet the needs of production development. In addition to actively reorganizing labor organizations, combining the promotion of small-scale mechanization, improving equipment utilization, and tapping the potential of enterprises, the North China Coal Mine Administration also held a safety production meeting in late April, addressing the still serious accident situation. In the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, the meeting exposed problems, exchanged experiences, and finally reached a consensus that as long as leaders at all levels are conscientious and responsible, have a broad and solid mass base, and have practical rules and regulations and safety measures, safe production can be achieved. The Northeast Coal Mine Administration also held a safety production meeting from May 25 to 31. The East China region held a technical professional meeting to specifically study how to promote the technical innovation movement by improving coal mining methods, promoting chart management, and strengthening production geological work, so as to further promote the labor competition.

In addition, in order to check the implementation of the instruction of "vigorously rectify labor organizations" in various units, the Coal Mine Management Bureau held a reporting meeting for the management bureaus of major administrative regions and key bureaus and mines, starting on May 25, which is of great help to the leadership in understanding the situation of grassroots units, promoting effective advanced experiences, and further tapping the potential of enterprises.

Xinhua News Agency, June 9th. The national petroleum industry exceeded the national production plan for May. The total output value completed 109.3 percent of the plan; the four major products were all completed very well, with crude oil at 109.7 percent, gasoline at 107.8 percent, kerosene at 135.7 percent, and diesel at 120.6 percent.

The petroleum industry's production in May greatly exceeded the level of the same period last year. The total output value exceeded by 56.2 percent; crude oil exceeded by 34.1 percent, gasoline exceeded by 57 percent, kerosene exceeded by 96.4 percent, and diesel exceeded by 18.9 percent.

The May production plans were better completed by the Northeast's Petroleum Plant No. 1 and Petroleum Plant No. 6, and the Northwest's Yumen Mining Bureau and Yanchang Oil Mine. In particular, Petroleum Plant No. 6 not only overfulfilled the operation plan, but also created a new record of 8.7 tons of coal to one ton of oil. Yanchang Oil Mine overfulfilled the May crude oil plan eleven days ahead of schedule in the labor competition, and due to the sufficient supply of crude oil, the entire refining plan was completed better.

In May, the petroleum industry successfully trial-produced two new products: one is the solvent oil for paint from Petroleum Plant No. 6; the other is the high melting point asphalt from the Yumen Mining Bureau Refinery.

[This Newspaper] Enterprises under the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Heavy Industry Department completed 103 percent of the national plan for total output value in May, and enterprises producing major products, such as Benxi Iron and Steel Company and 16 other units, all comprehensively overfulfilled the May major product plan.

Enterprises under the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau combined the promotion of advanced experience with the gradual development of the technical innovation movement in May. Most of the ironmaking workshops have successively promoted the advanced experience of the Soviet furnace top regulation and ore grading into the furnace. The furnace conditions of the blast furnaces have basically stabilized, and production has steadily increased. For example, the average daily output of pig iron in Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant in May increased by 1.43 percent compared with April. The No. 2 blast furnace has created a new record for daily output three times in a row, which is 6.7 percent higher than the new record in April. The effective volume utilization coefficient reached 0.766. The No. 6 blast furnace of Ma'anshan Iron Plant and the No. 1 blast furnace of the 101 Plant of Southwest Iron and Steel Company also created new records for daily output.

In terms of promoting the experience of rapid overhaul of blast furnaces, Benxi Iron and Steel Company and Longyan Iron Mine have achieved new results. The overhaul of two blast furnaces in these two units shortened the planned repair time by eleven days, nine hours, and fifteen minutes, and the increased value of pig iron produced reached 4.5 billion yuan.

The mechanization movement in small rolling mills has been further carried out in various enterprises. The wire rod workshop of Tianjin Steel Plant installed an automatic steel runner between the first and second rows of rolling mills, replacing the work of five workers and improving the output and quality of wire rod. The New Shanghai Steel Plant transformed the two-high roughing mill into a three-high mill, which provides favorable conditions for further increasing production and tapping potential capacity in the future.

In May, the flat steel production tasks of the 101 Plant and 104 Plant of Southwest Iron and Steel Company were not completed; some enterprises had major disaster accidents, which caused great losses in production. We should actively pay attention to improvement and prevention.

    全国煤矿、石油和钢铁工业局所属企业
    超额完成五月份国家生产计划
   【本报讯】全国国营煤矿在继续加强计划管理、重点贯彻厂长负责制和生产区域管理制的基础上，五月份超额百分之二点八完成了国家生产计划。其中除西南区只完成计划任务的百分之九十二点一外，其他各大行政区国营煤矿完成计划的情况都很好：东北区、华北区各超额百分之三，华东区超额百分之一点八，中南区超额百分之三点五，西北区超额百分之十点七。
    各大行政区国营煤矿在四、五月份生产中，都注意抓紧生产中的薄弱环节，及时提出改进措施，以不断提高企业管理水平，适应生产发展的需要。华北区煤矿管理局除积极整顿劳动组织，结合推行小型机械化、提高设备利用率，挖掘企业潜力外，并针对事故情况仍然严重的现象，在四月下旬召开了安全生产会议。会议以批评和自我批评的精神，揭发问题、交流经验，最后得出一致的结论，认为只要各级领导干部认真负责、有广泛巩固的群众基础，再加上切合实际的规程制度和安全措施，是能够做到安全生产的。东北区煤矿管理局从五月二十五日到三十一日也举行了安全生产会议。华东区则召开了技术专业会议，具体研究了如何通过改进采煤方法、推行图表管理以及加强生产地质工作等措施，开展技术革新运动，把劳动竞赛向前推进一步。
    此外，煤矿管理总局为了检查各单位对于“大力整顿劳动组织”这一指示的贯彻情况，在五月二十五日起召开全国各大行政区管理局及重点局、矿的汇报会议，这对帮助领导方面了解基层单位的情况，推广行之有效的先进经验，进一步挖掘企业潜在力量是有很大作用的。
   【新华社九日讯】全国石油工业超额完成五月份的国家生产计划。总产值完成计划百分之一百零九点三；四项主要产品都完成得很好，计原油为百分之一百零九点七，汽油为百分之一百零七点八，煤油为百分之一百三十五点七，柴油为百分之一百二十点六。
    石油工业五月份的生产大大超过了去年同期的水平。计总产值超过百分之五十六点二；原油超过百分之三十四点一，汽油超过百分之五十七，煤油超过百分之九十六点四，柴油超过百分之十八点九。
    五月份的生产计划以东北的石油一厂和石油六厂、西北的玉门矿务局和延长油矿等完成得比较好。特别是石油六厂不但超额完成了作业计划，还创造了八点七吨煤出一吨油的新纪录。延长油矿在劳动竞赛中提前十一天超额完成五月份的原油计划，由于原油供应充足，整个炼油计划也就完成得比较好。
    五月份，石油工业又有两项新的产品试制成功，一项是石油六厂的油漆用的溶剂油；另一项是玉门矿务局炼油厂的高溶点沥青。
   【本报讯】中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属企业五月份生产总值完成国家计划百分之一百零三，生产主要产品的企业有本溪钢铁公司等十六个单位都全面超额完成了五月份主要产品计划。
    钢铁工业管理局所属企业五月份结合推广先进经验，逐步开展了技术革新运动。大部分炼铁车间已陆续推行苏联炉顶调剂和矿石分级入炉的先进经验，高炉炉况基本上趋于稳定，生产稳步上升。如太原钢铁厂五月份生铁平均日产量比四月份提高了百分之一点四三，第二号高炉曾连续三次创造日产量新纪录，较四月份新纪录提高了百分之六点七，有效容积利用系数达到零点七六六。马鞍山铁厂第六号高炉和西南钢铁公司一○一厂第一号高炉也都创造了日产量新纪录。
    在推广高炉快速大修的经验方面，本溪钢铁公司和龙烟铁矿都取得了新的成绩。这两个单位的两座高炉大修共较计划修理时间缩短了十一天九小时十五分，增产的生铁价值达四十五亿元。
    小型轧钢车间机械化运动，已在各企业中进一步展开。天津钢厂线材车间在第一排和第二排轧钢机之间，装置自动跑钢机代替了五个工人的工作，并提高了线材的产量和质量。新沪钢铁厂将二重式粗轧机改装为三重式，为今后进一步提高产量，挖掘潜在能力提供了有利条件。
    五月份中，西南钢铁公司一○一厂和一○四厂平炉钢生产任务没有完成；一部分企业曾发生重大灾害事故，使生产遭到很大损失，应该积极注意改进和防范。
