Guangdong Province Builds New State-Owned Farms to Cultivate Subtropical Cash Crops

    The six state-owned mechanized farms newly built in Guangdong Province this year are vigorously developing subtropical cash crops, following the principle of adapting to local conditions. Except for the State-owned Pearl River Mechanized Farm in the Pearl River Delta, which mainly grows food crops due to its location in the fertile sandy fields, the other three state-owned mechanized farms on Hainan Island, "Red Island," "Red October," and "Sanmenpo," and the two state-owned mechanized farms on the Leizhou Peninsula, "Golden Star" and "Oriental Red," are all located in subtropical areas with water scarcity, strong winds, arid climates, particularly high ground temperatures, and high evaporation rates. These areas are particularly suitable for cultivating subtropical cash crops, such as the important industrial raw materials sisal, kenaf, and lemongrass, the famous fruit pineapple, as well as coffee and rare tropical plants such as quinine and coca (raw material for anesthetics). Sisal can be harvested in the second year after planting and can be harvested continuously for ten years. The "Sarawak" variety of pineapple has a sweet taste and large fruit, with a single pineapple typically weighing four to five pounds, and the largest weighing up to twelve pounds. The above five state-owned farms have a total cultivated area of more than 61,000 mu, and the cultivated area of sisal, kenaf, pineapple, lemongrass, coffee, and other subtropical cash crops will account for about 40,000 mu. These crops can be planted almost all year round, and these farms are now engaged in a vigorous sowing campaign. (Wu Erxiang)

    广东省新建国营农场种植亚热带经济作物
    广东省今年新建的六个国营机耕农场，根据因地制宜种植的方针，大量发展亚热带的经济作物。除了在珠江三角洲上的国营珠江机耕农场，因地处肥沃的沙田地带，以种植粮食作物为主外，其他在海南岛上的“红岛”、“红十月”、“三门坡”三个国营机耕农场和在雷州半岛上的“金星”、“东方红”两个国营机耕农场，都处于缺水多风，气候干旱，地温特高，蒸发量大的亚热带地区。这些地区特别适宜于种植亚热带的经济作物，如重要的工业原料剑麻、番麻、香茅草，著名水果菠萝以及咖啡和热带希有的珍贵植物如金鸡纳霜、古柯（麻醉剂原料）等。剑麻下种后第二年就有收成，可以连收十年。“沙罗哇”品种的菠萝，味甜果大，一个菠萝一般的都有四、五斤重，最大的重达十二斤。以上五个国营农场共有耕地面积六万一千多亩，而种植的剑麻、番麻、菠萝、香茅草、咖啡和其他亚热带经济作物，约将占有四万亩左右。这些作物几乎全年都可以下种，现在这些农场正展开热烈的播种运动。（吴尔祥）
