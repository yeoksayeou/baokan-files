Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 21st — The 350,000 mu of wheat in the Yellow River irrigation area on the northern plains of Henan Province has seen a universal bumper harvest. In the irrigation area, in the fourth district of Xinxiang County, where the soil is most fertile and the harvest has always been the best, the more than 60,000 mu of wheat fields irrigated by water diverted from the Yellow River this year averaged 170 jin of wheat per mu, an increase of nearly 20% compared to last year; the wheat fields irrigated by the Baima branch canal, which was only put into use last autumn, averaged only 120 jin of wheat per mu last year, but this year they averaged 156 jin per mu; the wheat in the saline-alkali areas of the fifth district of Xinxiang County, where yields have always been the lowest, averaged 30% to 50% higher per mu this year than last year.

Before the wheat harvest began in the Yellow River irrigation area, 60 agricultural production cooperatives and many mutual aid teams had already set plans to sell wheat to the state. The members of the "Jianyi" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shibei Village, Xinxiang County, seeing the plump new wheat grains that had just been threshed, all said: If the state hadn't built the Yellow River irrigation canal, how could we have such a good harvest? The whole cooperative unanimously decided to sell the best 25,000 jin of wheat to the state.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi — The more than 400,000 mu of winter and spring wheat planted by the units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Xinjiang Military Region participating in agricultural production are generally growing well and a bumper harvest is expected. Preliminary assessments of the 120,000 mu of winter wheat in the Manas River reclamation area estimate that the average yield per unit area will increase by 15% to 20% compared to last year, with the yield of 30,000 mu of high-yield fields reaching 470 jin per mu.

The units participating in agricultural production will basically use machine harvesting during this year's summer harvest, with plans to deploy a total of 63 combine harvesters and 490 horse-drawn reapers. At present, the units in each reclamation area are actively carrying out summer harvest preparations, overhauling agricultural machinery and tools, and continuing to strengthen field management. The combine harvester training class for over 70 people, organized by the units participating in agricultural production in the Manas River reclamation area, has already graduated.

    河南引黄灌溉区三十五万亩小麦普遍丰收
    新疆军区农业生产部队种植的冬、春小麦生长良好
    【新华社开封二十一日电】河南省北部平原上引黄灌溉区的三十五万亩小麦普遍丰收。在灌溉区里，土质最为肥沃、收成一向最好的新乡县四区引黄河水灌溉的六万多亩麦田，今年每亩平均产麦一百七十斤，比去年增产差不多两成；去年秋天才放水的白马支渠浇灌的麦田，去年每亩小麦平均只有一百二十斤，今年每亩平均一百五十六斤；产量一向最低的新乡县五区盐碱地区的小麦，今年每亩小麦平均都比去年增产三成到五成。
    引黄灌溉区开镰收割小麦以前，六十个农业生产合作社和许多互助组都订出了把小麦卖给国家的计划。新乡县石碑村的“建一”农业生产合作社的社员们，看到刚打出来的籽粒饱满的新麦粒，都说：要不是国家修了引黄灌溉渠，咱们怎能会有这样的好收成。全社一致决定把最好的两万五千斤小麦卖给国家。
    【新华社乌鲁木齐讯】中国人民解放军新疆军区参加农业生产的部队种植的四十多万亩冬、春小麦，普遍生长良好，可望丰收。玛纳斯河流域屯垦区的十二万亩冬麦经初步鉴定，预计平均单位面积产量将比去年提高百分之十五到二十，其中三万亩大面积丰产田的产量每亩可达四百七十斤。
    参加农业生产的部队今年夏收时基本上将采用机器收割，计划共出动康拜因收割机六十三台，马拉割麦机四百九十台。目前各屯垦区的部队正积极进行夏收准备工作，检修农业机器和农具，并继续加强田间管理。玛纳斯河流域屯垦区参加农业生产的部队举办的七十多人的康拜因机手训练班已经结业。
