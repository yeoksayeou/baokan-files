Five major water conservancy projects in Guanyun Reclamation Area, Jiangsu Province, were all completed before the flood season in mid-May. These include: the Shanhouchun River dredging project, the Shanhouchun Sluice and Wutu Sluice construction projects, the seawall project from the Shanhouchun River to the Wutu River, and the Chezhou River Dam project connecting the seawalls on both sides of the Chezhou River. The completion of these five projects will gradually improve the saline-alkali soil in the reclamation area, allowing the reclamation of 700,000 mu of wasteland; and it can also exempt approximately 2.6 million mu of farmland from waterlogging disasters.

Guanyun East is a fertile plain, but due to accumulated water flowing eastward from the west and tidal water pushing from the east, the riverbeds of the dry rivers are shallow and narrow, and drainage is not smooth, often causing waterlogging. In order to further improve the people's lives and develop agricultural production, the Party and the government built the Wutu Sluice and Shanhouchun Sluice at the upper end of the drainage outlet—Laizi Estuary, to block the tide from rising, and deepened and widened the Shanhouchun River to allow the accumulated water from the upper reaches to flow smoothly into the sea through the Wutu and Shanhouchun Sluices. In case of drought, the sluice gates are lowered to hold back the freshwater from the upper reaches for irrigation. The 700,000 mu of saline wasteland can be gradually improved by rainwater leaching, and the current grassland and weedy marshes can be turned into fertile fields in three to five years.

At present, the Guanyun Reclamation Area Sluice Management Office is strengthening the management and maintenance of the newly built sluice projects, earnestly grasping the water situation, so that it can exert the greatest effect in irrigation and drainage, and strive for a greater harvest this year.

    江苏省灌云垦区兴建五项水利工程
    使七十万亩盐碱荒地可以开始放垦
    江苏省灌云垦区五项较大的水利工程，已于五月中旬汛期以前全部完工。其中包括：善后河疏浚工程，善后闸、五图闸建筑工程，善后河至五图河的海堤工程，和连贯车轴河两岸海堤的车轴河坝工程。这五项工程的完成，将使垦区盐碱性的土壤逐步得到改良，七十万亩荒地可以放垦；并且可使约二百六十万亩农田免除内涝灾害。
    灌云东部是个肥沃的平原，但因西有积水东流，东有潮水顶托，干河河床浅窄，排水不畅，往往形成内涝。党和政府为了进一步改善人民生活，发展农业生产，在排水的总出口——埒子口上端，建了五图闸和善后闸，挡住潮水不使上漾，又将善后河河身浚深挖宽，使上游积水舒畅地从五图、善后两闸流到海里去。如遇天旱，就将闸门放下，关住上游淡水，进行灌溉。七十万亩盐渍性的荒地，受雨水淋洗，土壤可以逐渐改良，现在的草地柴荡，三、五年后就可以变成良田。
    目前，灌云垦区闸坝管理所正对新建的闸坝工程加强管理和养护，切实掌握水情，使其在灌溉和排水方面发挥最大的效能，争取今年更大的丰收。
