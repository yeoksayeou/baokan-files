Since April, the Northwest region has established another 87 agricultural production cooperatives. Together with the existing old cooperatives and those established before the end of March, the total number has reached more than 1,180.

The agricultural production cooperatives established in various places this year started plowing earlier, worked faster, and did a better job than mutual aid teams and individual farmers. The Shengli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chang'an County originally planned to weed 70 mu of wheat in ten days, but because it fully utilized the labor force of male and female members, it only took four days. In many cooperatives in Shaanxi and Gansu, the amount of fertilizer applied to cotton fields and spring wheat fields increased by about one-fifth compared with previous years. Other farming techniques have also been greatly improved. In Gansu and other places, strip planting of wheat fields in agricultural production cooperatives accounted for about one-half, an increase of about 30 percent compared with the mutual aid team period. In the Guanzhong area, the cotton fields of agricultural production cooperatives were generally cultivated more carefully, with more fertilizer applied, and most paid attention to seed treatment. Agricultural production cooperatives played a particularly leading and promoting role in stabilizing and appropriately expanding cotton fields. According to incomplete statistics from six counties including Mizhi, Yulin, Qingjian, Nanzheng, Chenggu, and Baocheng, a total of more than 40,000 mu of cotton fields were expanded due to the driving and influencing effect of agricultural production cooperatives. At the same time, due to the increased labor efficiency, agricultural production cooperatives can save more labor and time for land processing and agricultural infrastructure construction. Twenty-six cooperatives in Mizhi Dujiashigou and other places completed more than 224 mu of terraced fields three months ahead of schedule. The old cooperatives in various places have also made significant improvements in organizational leadership and management after preliminary rectification. All of these have powerfully influenced and promoted the production of the local masses. (Li Ruobin)

    西北区农业合作社在春耕中起了显著作用
    四月份以来，西北部分地区又增办农业生产合作社八十七个，连原有老社和三月底以前所建起的社，共达一千一百八十多个。
    各地所建起的农业生产合作社，今年春季锄地都比互助组和单干户动手得早、做得快、做得好。长安县胜利农业生产合作社七十亩小麦原计划十天锄完，因充分使用了男女社员的劳动力，只用了四天工夫。陕西、甘肃各地许多社的棉田和春麦地的施肥量比往年增加五分之一左右。其他耕作技术也有很大改进。甘肃等地农业生产合作社的麦田条播约占二分之一，比互助组时期增加百分之三十上下。关中地区农业生产合作社的棉田普遍耕的细致，施肥多，并大多注意了进行种籽处理工作。在稳定和适当扩大棉田上，农业生产合作社特别起了带头和推动作用。据米脂、榆林、清涧、南郑、城固、褒城等六个县的不完全统计，由于农业生产合作社的带动和影响，共扩大棉田四万多亩。同时，农业生产合作社由于劳动效率的提高，就能节省出更多的劳力和时间进行土地加工，作好农业基本建设。米脂杜家石沟等二十六个社提前三个月修成二百二十四亩多梯田。各地老社经过初步整顿，在组织领导与经营管理方面，也都有了显著提高。所有这些，都有力地影响和推动了当地群众的生产。（李若彬）
