Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: TASS, Paris, June 5th: According to newspaper reports, French Prime Minister Laniel and Bao Dai government Prime Minister Buu Hoi signed the so-called "Treaty of Independence and Cooperation" between France and the Bao Dai regime on the 4th.

The French "Liberation" wrote about this matter: "Everyone knows that after the ratification of this treaty, the 'member states of the Federation' will be granted complete diplomatic independence, including the right to sign military agreements with other countries and to refuse to accept various peace treaties signed by France and the Ho Chi Minh government. For several months, the United States has been insisting on this treaty because it can become a major obstacle to establishing peace in Indochina and reaching all political resolutions regarding the resolution of the Indochina conflict."

    美法又一次制造和平的障碍
    法国和保大订“独立与合作”条约
   【新华社六日讯】塔斯社巴黎五日讯：据报纸消息说，法国总理拉尼埃和保大政府总理宝禄于四日签订了法国和保大政权之间的所谓“独立与合作”条约。
    法国“解放报”就此事写道：“大家知道，这种条约批准之后，将给予‘联邦成员国’完全的外交上的独立，其中包括和其他国家签订军事协定以及拒绝接受法国和胡志明政府所签订的各种和平条约的权利。几个月来，美国一直坚持这种条约，因为它能变为对于建立印度支那和平以及达成关于解决印度支那冲突的一切政治性决议的主要障碍。”
