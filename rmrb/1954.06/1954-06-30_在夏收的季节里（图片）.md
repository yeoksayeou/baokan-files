In the Season of Summer Harvest

    In this year's wheat harvest, the State-owned Guangbei Farm in Shandong Province adopted a continuous operation method using combine harvesters, harvesting 65 mu per hour, doubling the efficiency compared to last year, and saving one driver's manpower and half of the fuel. This is a tractor pulling two combine harvesters harvesting wheat in the wheat field.

      The wheat reaped by the Guangbei Tractor Station in Shandong Province for the Sanliushu Agricultural Production Cooperative was harvested quickly and threshed cleanly, and the wheat was transported to the threshing ground in a timely manner, fully demonstrating the superiority of agricultural mechanization.

    In order to help the masses solve the contradiction between the summer harvest and summer planting time conflicts, to ensure timely grain storage and timely sowing, the Guangbei Tractor Station in Shandong Province actively undertakes harvesting and threshing for the masses. This is the station using a combine harvester to thresh for the Zhao Jia Zui Zi Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Seventh District of Guangrao County.
