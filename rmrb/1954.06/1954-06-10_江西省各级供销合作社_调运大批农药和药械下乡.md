    Jiangxi Province Supply and Marketing Cooperatives at All Levels
    Transfer Large Quantities of Pesticides and Equipment to the Countryside
    Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Jiangxi Province are actively transferring agricultural pesticides and equipment to the countryside to help farmers prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests. Currently, the following have been transported to rural areas: more than 48,000 jin of "666" pesticide powder, 90,000 jin of DDT pesticide, more than 80,000 lián of cotton oil soap, 70,000 jin of sulfur powder, more than 1,700 sprayers, as well as sulfur blocks, sprayers, etc.
    In previous years, the scope of pesticide and equipment operations in Jiangxi Province was limited to 23 counties in cotton-growing areas. This year, the supply scope has been expanded to 43 counties. Before determining the pesticide and equipment supply plan, many regions investigated the actual needs of farmers. Some supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas have also signed supply contracts with agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams, overcoming the problem of blind operation in the past. At present, some grassroots cooperatives in counties such as Linchuan and Xingan have begun to supply pesticides and equipment. Many areas also used methods such as exhibition pictures to publicize the effectiveness and usage methods of pesticides and equipment.

    江西省各级供销合作社
    调运大批农药和药械下乡
    江西省各级供销合作社积极调运农业药剂和农业药械下乡，帮助农民防治病虫害，现已运到农村的，有“六六六”药粉四万八千多斤、滴滴涕药剂九万斤、棉油皂八万多连、硫磺粉七万斤、喷雾器一千七百多架，以及硫磺块、喷雾器等。
    往年，江西省农药械的经营范围，仅限于棉区的二十三个县，今年已将供应范围扩展到四十三个县。在确定农药械供应计划以前，许多地区调查了农民的实际需要情况。有些地区的供销合作社还和农业生产合作社、互助组签订了供应合同，克服了以往盲目经营的毛病。目前，临川、新淦等县部分基层合作社已开始供应农药械。许多地区并用展览画片等办法宣传了农药械的效用和使用方法。
