    The Tianjin Railway Bureau's Trial Implementation of an Audit and Supervision System is Effective

    The Tianjin Railway Bureau, learning from the experience of the Sino-Soviet Railway, is piloting an audit and supervision system to oversee the completion of production and financial plans and to prevent and expose wasteful practices in cash and material management.

    Since mid-February this year, the bureau has expanded its original People's Supervision Office, established a Revenue Supervision Section, an Expenditure Supervision Section, and a People's Complaint Acceptance Section. It has also established supervision work groups in the Tianjin Railway Branch and the Shijiazhuang Railway Branch to conduct audit and supervision work. Seventy supervisors and more than two hundred people's supervision correspondents are fighting against phenomena of wasting state resources and damaging production and financial plans along the railway line, and have achieved results.

    In the past two months, supervisors have prevented unnecessary expenditures of over 350 million yuan in their audit and supervision work. In twenty-four units, including the Tianjin Engineering Section, Construction Section, and Electrical Section, they have found materials outside the books, surplus materials, and small warehouse materials worth over 900 million yuan. The supervision work group stationed at the Tianjin Railway Branch also discovered chaotic cash management practices in many units. At the end of April this year, supervisors analyzed the past cash usage of fifteen units and found that these units had wasted over 490 million yuan in cash.

    In supervising the work of train operations, commercial operations, and passenger transport, supervisors have identified instances of wasted railway transport capacity. They analyzed the transport work of Dezhou Station in February and found that the trains were short of tonnage by a total of 58,800 tons, wasting over 10 million ton-kilometers, equivalent to a loss of over 18 billion yuan in state revenue. The labor discipline of the Tianjin Locomotive Depot is lax, with widespread absenteeism, lateness, and absenteeism without leave.

    After the supervisors identified these situations, they promptly reported them to the People's Supervision Office and have issued thirty-nine letters of recommendation and five letters of suggestion, requesting that the units rectify these shortcomings. The units have been able to earnestly overcome their shortcomings after receiving these suggestions. The Tianjin Engineering Section, the Tianjin Construction Section, and other units have cleared up materials outside the books and small warehouse materials and turned these materials over to the state. Some units have also stopped spending recklessly as they did in the past and have begun to pay attention to financial discipline.

    天津铁路管理局试行稽核监察制度有效果
    天津铁路管理局学习中长铁路经验，试行稽核监察制度，监督生产财务计划的完成，防止和揭发在现金和材料管理上的浪费现象。
    从今年二月中旬起，该局扩充了原来的人民监察室，建立了收入监督科，开支监督科和人民控诉受理科，并在天津铁路分局、石家庄铁路分局成立了监察工作组，进行稽核监察的工作。七十名监察员和二百多名人民监察通讯员正在铁路沿线向浪费国家资材、破坏生产财务计划的现象作斗争，并获得了效果。
    两个多月来，监察员在稽核监察工作中，防止了三亿五千多万元的不必要的开支。在天津工务段、建筑段、电务段等二十四个单位里，检查出价值九亿多万元的账外材料、多余材料和小仓库材料等。驻在天津铁路分局的监察工作组还发现许多单位在现金管理上的混乱现象。今年四月底，监察员分析十五个单位已往使用的现金的情况，发现这些单位浪费了的现金就有四亿九千多万元。
    在监督车务、商务和客运等业务工作中，监察员检查出铁路运输能力的浪费现象。他们分析二月份德州车站的运输工作，发现欠吨的列车共达五万八千八百多吨，浪费一千多万吨公里，等于国家少收入一百八十多亿元。天津机务段的劳动纪律松懈，缺勤、迟到、旷职的现象很普遍。
    监察员检查出这些情况后，及时上报人民监察室，并已发出三十九件建议书和五件建议信，要求各单位纠正这些缺点。各单位接到这些建议后，都能认真克服自己的缺点。天津工务段、天津建筑段等单位清查了账外材料和小仓库材料，并把这些材料上缴给国家。有些单位也不像过去那样地乱开支，开始重视财政纪律。
