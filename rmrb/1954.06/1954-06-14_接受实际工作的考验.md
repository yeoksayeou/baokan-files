Accepting the Test of Practical Work

    Ge Dingyi, Second-Year Student of the Mineral Geology Exploration Specialization Course, Beijing Institute of Geology

    Whenever I review mineral deposit geology or prospecting methods, I often think: One day, I will be in an exploration team in the wilderness, stepping on hillsides that no one has ever visited, carefully surveying the land of our motherland. Based on the theory of rocks and mineral deposits, I will search for coal, oil, and metal mines hidden underground from the subtle changes in rocks. I often secretly calculate how many billions of tons of coal there would be in a coal mine of several hundred square kilometers and tens of meters thick! I even think that in a few years, when I pass through this area again, how magnificent and modern a city will have been built here. Perhaps, the people here will not know the work we have done here, but as discoverers of the mine, we first dripped sweat on this land, how can we hide the joy in our hearts?
    The two years of study life in the specialization course have passed quickly. In this summer's production practice, we will join the production team for the first time and use our labor to complete a part of the national 1954 general survey task. This practical work will test whether we can really use our labor to realize our ideals and create wealth for the motherland. Soviet experts in the school have taught us: Geological work is very complicated work. In addition to requiring huge physical labor, it also requires the application of knowledge from mathematics, physics, chemistry to philosophy, from celestial bodies, the universe, the earth, mountains, and rivers to the internal structure of tiny crystals. Obviously, we have only studied in the specialization course for two years, and our knowledge is very shallow. It is difficult to do a good job. However, we are not afraid of difficulties. We have long been determined to learn from teachers, classmates, workers, and everyone around us. As long as we concentrate on learning, we can learn today what we don't know tomorrow.

    接受实际工作的考验
    北京地质学院矿产地质勘查专修科二年级学生  戈定夷
    每当我温习矿床学或找矿方法的时候，常常会想起：有这么一天，自己已置身于荒野中的一个勘查队里，踏上从来没有人到过的山坡，仔细地勘察着祖国的土地。根据岩石、矿床的理论，从岩石细微的变化中找寻蕴藏在地下的煤、石油和金属矿。我常常暗自计算几百平方公里大几十公尺厚的煤矿会有多少亿吨煤哟！我甚至想到几年之后，当我走过这一地区的时候，这里会建设起多么雄伟的现代化城市。也许，这里的人们不会知道我们曾经在这里作过的工作，但是，作为矿山发现者，我们首先在这土地上滴下汗珠，怎能隐藏得住心中的喜悦呢？
    专修科两年的学习生活飞速地过去了。今年暑期生产实习中，我们就要第一次加入到生产队伍中去，用自己的劳动来完成国家一九五四年普查任务的一部分。这一次的实际工作将考验我们是不是真的能用自己的劳动来实现自己的理想，为祖国创造财富。学校里苏联专家曾教导我们：地质工作是很复杂的工作，它除了要花费巨大的体力劳动以外，更要应用从数学、物理、化学直到哲学，从天体宇宙、地球、山河直到微小晶体内部结构的各方面的知识。很显然，我们只在专修科学习了两年，知识是很浅薄的，要做好工作是困难的。但是，我们不怕困难，我们早就下定了向老师，向同学，向工人，向周围一切人学习的决心。只要我们专心学习，今天不会的东西，明天是可以学会的。
