    Zhangjiakou Transportation Branch Company's Qi Fengxiang Conducts Self-Criticism of Bureaucratic Work Style
    Qi Fengxiang, Manager of the Zhangjiakou Transportation Branch Company, writes: The criticism in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on May 6 regarding "Loading Stations and 'Loading Warehouses'" is correct. In September of last year, our company, based on instructions from the Hebei Provincial Department of Transportation, changed the name of the intermodal stations set up along the railway line to transportation warehouses; this decision to change the name did not include the Xuanhua City Loading Station. However, when our company uniformly engraved the seals, we carelessly engraved a seal for the Xuanhua City "Loading Warehouse" and sent it out together. When Comrade Wu Zhang, Deputy Station Master of the Xuanhua City Loading Station, came to express his opinion, I did not humbly accept it but instead said irresponsibly, "This is an instruction from higher authorities and must be followed."
    This incident shows that my bureaucratic and careless work style is very serious. Because I have a blindly complacent attitude, I did not carefully consider the opinions of others, and I replied self-righteously. In the future, I am determined to correct this shortcoming, work hard to strengthen my learning, improve my policy and ideological level, and do my work practically.

### 张家口运输分公司齐逢祥检讨工作中的官僚主义作风

    张家口运输分公司齐逢祥检讨工作中的官僚主义作风
    张家口运输分公司经理齐逢祥来信：五月六日“读者来信摘要”栏所刊读者关于“搬运站和‘搬运栈’”的批评是正确的。去年九月，我公司根据河北省交通厅指示，将铁路沿线所设的联运站改名为运输栈；这个改变名称的决定，并不包括宣化市搬运站在内。但是我公司统一刻制戳记时，却粗枝大叶地刻了一个宣化市“搬运栈”的戳记，也一并发下去了。宣化市搬运站副站长吴璋同志来反映意见时，我没有虚心接受，反而不负责任地说：“这是上级指示，必须照办。”
    这个事件说明：我在工作中的官僚主义和粗枝大叶的作风是很严重的。由于我有着盲目自满的情绪，在旁人对我提出意见时也不很好考虑，就自以为是地答复了。今后我决心改正这个缺点，努力加强学习，提高政策思想水平，踏实地做好工作。
