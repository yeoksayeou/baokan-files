    People from all walks of life in various countries have strongly condemned the armed aggression against the democratic government of Guatemala by the mercenary exiles instigated by US imperialism.

    The broad masses of people in Latin American countries are continuing to launch movements to defend Guatemala and denounce the aggression. Chilean students have held many demonstrations in succession to support Guatemala. Youth organizations belonging to seven political parties in Chile have issued a letter to the youth of Chile, calling on them to unite and fight against the forces that are aggressing against Guatemala. The Chilean Chamber of Deputies passed a resolution on the evening of the 22nd condemning the aggression against Guatemala and proposed that the parliaments of Latin American countries jointly condemn the armed intervention in Guatemala.

    The Argentine Chamber of Deputies also passed a resolution requesting the parliaments of Latin American countries to work together to restore peace in Guatemala and respect Guatemala's right to independence.

    The "Movement to Defend Guatemala" in Uruguay held a mass meeting on the 21st, expressing firm support for the fighting people of Guatemala. Workers in Montevideo held a protest demonstration in front of the US Embassy. In addition, many organizations in Mexico have also unanimously denounced the imperialists for launching armed attacks on Guatemala.

    The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) issued a letter to the youth of the world regarding the armed aggression against Guatemala.

    The letter to the youth of the world stated: The Secretariat of the WFDY, representing its 83 million members, strongly protests against the actions that violate the rights and independence of the people of Guatemala, and calls on young men and women all over the world, especially young men and women in Latin America, to express their indignation and solidarity with this attack on a peaceful people in a resolute manner, and demands an end to this aggression.

    The WFDY sent a telegram to the Security Council, condemning the aggression against Guatemala. The Secretariat of the WFDY also sent a telegram to the youth of Guatemala, expressing solidarity with their struggle to resist the aggressors.

    Czechoslovak newspapers condemned the US armed intervention in Guatemala. An article in "Red Right Newspaper" on the 22nd stated: All the facts show that the armed intervention in Guatemala is an event planned by the US ruling clique for the benefit of US monopoly capital in an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government elected by the people of Guatemala. The article said that the sympathy of all peace-loving people is on the side of the people of Guatemala. Therefore, countries all over the world strongly condemn the US ruling clique's attack on Guatemala's independence, and justly believe that this is also an attack on the principles of national independence and freedom stipulated in the UN Charter.

    In Asia, in Burma, the Burmese Workers and Peasants Party, the "We Burmese" Party, the Burmese People's Peace Front, the People's Unity Party, the All-Burma Trade Union Congress, the All-Burma Peasants Association, the Burmese People's Youth League, and the Burmese Democratic Women's Organization have sent a telegram to the UN Secretary-General, firmly protesting the US armed aggression against Guatemala, and demanding "an immediate end to the aggression."

    On June 22, a rally in support of Guatemala was held in Vienna. Franz Marek, a member of the Central Committee of the Austrian Communist Party, said at the meeting that the whole world condemns the aggression of the US imperialists against a peace-loving country. The Austrian Peace Council also issued a statement, assuring the government and people of Guatemala of its solidarity.

    The "Finnish Peace League," holding its annual meeting in Helsinki, has sent a telegram to the United Nations, requesting immediate measures to stop the armed aggression against Guatemala.
