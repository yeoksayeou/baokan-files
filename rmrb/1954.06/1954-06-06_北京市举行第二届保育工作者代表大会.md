    Beijing Holds Second Representative Assembly of Nursery Workers
    The Beijing Democratic Women's Federation and the First Executive Committee of the Beijing Nursery Workers' Representative Conference convened the Second Representative Assembly of Nursery Workers in Beijing on June 3rd and 4th. More than 560 people attended, including representatives elected by various nursery organizations, outstanding childcare workers, and guests.
    At the meeting, Fang Qing, Minister of the Women and Children's Welfare Department of the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation, gave a report on the basic situation and future tasks of childcare work. The report pointed out that since the First Representative Assembly of Nursery Workers in Beijing was held in November 1951, with the development of national economic construction and the needs of the masses, childcare organizations in Beijing have greatly developed. According to incomplete statistics in March of this year, the city has increased to more than 430 various nursery organizations, with more than 20,300 children in care and more than 9,800 childcare workers. Compared with before liberation, the number of childcare institutions has increased by 14 times, the number of children in care has increased by 5 times, and the number of childcare workers has increased by 45 times. The report put forward the future tasks: first, to study the Party's general line in the transition period, and establish the ideology of loving children and loving socialism; to learn from advanced Soviet experience, and cultivate children's all-round development; representatives of childcare workers should unite childcare workers in the city, and play a backbone and leading role in work and study.
    At the meeting, the People's Printing Factory Nursery, the Fifth Nursery Station in Xidan District, the Nursery of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government, and the June 1st Kindergarten respectively gave typical speeches on how factory nurseries closely cooperate with production to take good care of children, how to overcome difficulties to do a good job, and how to carry out the love-children movement.
    Kang Keqing, Minister of the Women and Children's Welfare Department of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, both attended and spoke at the meeting. They unanimously pointed out that in our country, which has entered the period of planned economic construction, cultivating the next generation is of great significance, and they hoped that the representatives present would: work with peace of mind, establish professional ideology; delve into business, learn from advanced Soviet experience; strengthen unity, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and strive to dedicate themselves to the childcare cause.
    The meeting finally elected 45 executive committee members and 5 alternate executive committee members of the Second Representative Assembly of Nursery Workers.
