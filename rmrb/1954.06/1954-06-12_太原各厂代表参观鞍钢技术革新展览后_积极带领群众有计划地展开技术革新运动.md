Taiyuan Factory Representatives Visit Anshan Iron and Steel's Technical Innovation Exhibition, Actively Lead the Masses to Launch Planned Technical Innovation Movement

After visiting the Anshan Iron and Steel Technical Innovation Exhibition, representatives from various factories in Taiyuan City actively led the masses to launch a broader and deeper technical innovation movement in their respective factories. After returning to their factories, the representatives widely conveyed their experiences and insights to the staff and workers, using their practical actions to motivate the masses to engage in technical innovation. Cheng Genxiong, the electrical foreman of the coking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and a model worker of Shanxi Province, had been working on creating a "coal-iron separator" for more than nine months to solve the critical problem of frequent accidents with coal washing machines affecting production. However, he had not been successful. After visiting the exhibition, he was inspired by the creative deeds of Zhang Mingshan and Wang Chonglun. He examined and criticized his past "lone wolf" thinking and lack of the spirit of overcoming difficulties and diligent research. He immediately mobilized all the workers in his group to collectively research, find the main reasons for past failures, and absorb the suggestion of worker Zhi Weiping and others to use "magnetic steel sheets" in the manufacturing. He also took the initiative to study with engineer Peng Shizhong twice. As a result, it only took three days to successfully trial-produce a "coal-iron separator" that had not been successful for more than nine months. After returning from his visit, Li Chunyuan, a technician in the steelmaking department, researched with the workers and proposed the idea of ​​a "mineral ore automatic conveyor belt." Once this suggestion is realized, the raw material loading and unloading of the steelmaking department can be fully mechanized. Li Chunyuan also proposed to promote the advanced experiences of Anshan Iron and Steel's "motor high-temperature stopper," "motor high-temperature cut-off device," and "gas remote indicator," planning to implement them in the third quarter. At the same time, he also actively helped workers test major technical reforms such as "gas alarm" and "automatic open-hearth tapping." After studying the Anshan Iron and Steel experience, Zhang You, a technician in the raw material section of the ironmaking department, organized a technical innovation team with veteran workers and made specific plans to address key production issues. In June, they will improve the sintering furnace batching equipment, improve the quality of sintered ore, solve problems such as dust in the silos, improve the workers' operating environment, and promote Anshan Iron and Steel's advanced experiences such as "water level controller" and "automatic counter." Under the initiative of Gao Rudong, a technician at Shanxi Machine Factory and a model worker of Shanxi Province, a technical research group was established. Gao Rudong also went deep into the workshops to discover the advanced experiences of the workers and help them solve technical problems. Wang Kaishan, a 61-year-old technician at the No. 2 Power Plant of the Taiyuan Electric Power Bureau and a national model worker, is determined to pass on his decades of practical operating experience to everyone. Under his initiative, the factory also established a technical research association, with more than 30 young workers voluntarily participating in the technical research association's study. He and other technicians actively helped workers propose rationalization suggestions and continued to improve the "water level alarm" and "pipe washing nozzle" that had been preliminarily tested successfully. The advanced experiences of Anshan Iron and Steel brought back by the representatives, coupled with their creative labor, greatly promoted the leadership, enabling the technical innovation movement in various factories and mines to be widely launched. Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, Shanxi Machine Factory, Taiyuan Cement Plant, Taiyuan Paper Mill and other factories have formulated plans to launch a technical innovation movement. Some factories have improved the organization of mass rationalization proposals. The ironmaking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Shanxi Machine Factory and other units have put forward topics addressing key production issues. The ironmaking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has also held a small-scale technical innovation exhibition, and many factories and mines are also actively preparing to do so. Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant has opened four formal technical training classes. More and more staff and workers are joining the ranks of the technical innovation movement. (Zhao Qianshou)

    太原各厂代表参观鞍钢技术革新展览后
    积极带领群众有计划地展开技术革新运动
    太原市各厂工人、工程技术人员代表，参观了鞍钢技术革新展览会后，积极带领群众，使各厂的技术革新运动更广泛而深入地展开。代表们参观展览会回厂之后，都向厂里的职工进行了广泛的传达，介绍了自己的收获与心得。用自己的实际行动带动群众进行技术革新。太原钢铁厂炼焦部电气工长山西省劳动模范成根雄，为了解决洗煤机经常出事故影响生产的关键问题，在九个多月前就着手研究创造“煤铁分离器”，可是一直没有成功，他参观了展览会后，从张明山、王崇伦的创造事迹中，得到启示，检查并批判了自己过去存在的“单干”思想与缺乏克服困难、刻苦钻研的精神，马上发动全组工人集体研究，找出过去失败的主要原因，吸收了工人智维屏等提出用“吸钢片”制造的建议，又主动和工程师彭士忠研究了两次，结果只花了三天，便把九个多月未成功的一台“煤铁分离器”试制成功了。炼钢部技师李春渊参观回来后，和工人一起研究，提出“矿石自动运输带”的建议，这项建议实现后，便可使炼钢部原料装运全部机械化。李春渊并又提出推广鞍钢的“马达高温停止器”、“马达高温切断器”、“煤气远方指示表”等先进经验的建议，计划第三季度可陆续实现。同时，他还积极帮助工人们试验“煤气警报器”及“平炉自动打眼”等技术上的重大改革。炼铁部原料工段技术员张有学习了鞍钢经验后，和老工人们组织了技术革新小组，并针对生产上关键问题，作出具体计划，要在六月改进烧结炉配料设备，提高烧结矿质量，解决料仓粉尘等问题，改善工人操作环境，还要推广鞍钢“水位控制器”
  “自动计数器”等先进经验。山西机器厂在该厂技师、山西省劳动模范高如栋的倡议下，成立了技术研究小组，高如栋并深入车间，发现工人中的先进经验，帮助工人解决技术上的疑难问题。太原电业局第二发电厂六十一岁的老技师、全国劳动模范王凯山，决心要把他数十年的实际操作经验传授给大家，在他的倡议下，该厂也成立了技术研究会，有三十多个青年工人自愿参加了技术研究会的学习。他并和其他技术人员积极帮助工人提合理化建议，继续改进已初步试验成功的“水位警报器”“洗管器甩头”等。代表们带回来的鞍钢先进经验，与自己创造性的劳动，大大推动了领导，使各厂矿的技术革新运动能广泛地开展起来。太原钢铁厂、太原矿山机器厂、山西机器厂、太原水泥厂、太原造纸厂等已拟订出开展技术革新运动的方案，有的厂健全了群众合理化建议组织，太原钢铁厂炼铁部，山西机器厂等单位已针对生产关键问题提出了课题，太原钢铁厂炼铁部还举办了小型技术革新展览会，许多厂矿也正在积极筹办中。太原矿山机器厂开办了四个正规的技术学习班。越来越多的职工群众投入了技术革新运动的行列中。　　（赵谦受）
