    Chongqing Municipal People's Representatives are widely publicizing the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China to voters and organizing voters to discuss it.
    People's Representatives in various districts of the city have been actively organizing discussions and publicity among residents in recent days. People's Representative Pi Wenfang, every day during residents' rest and cool-off times, relates the actual examples of oppression suffered by local residents under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries to publicize the Draft Constitution and its close relationship to everyone. People's Representative Li Jiayun, who was rated as an exceptional model woman worker in Chongqing, after the promulgation of the Draft Constitution, worked with local cadres to organize forty reading groups for the masses to hold discussions. She also found relevant materials published in "Current Events Handbook" No. 11 to lecture reading group members and female activists, and read articles published in newspapers by industrial labor models and advanced workers to residents to inspire them to have a clearer understanding of the Draft Constitution. People's Representative Lü Bixian has been frequently running to nearby areas to borrow newspapers and find materials for residents to read, explaining the significance and content of the Draft Constitution to them these past eight or nine days. Several People's Representatives from the jointly-owned Yuxin Textile Factory have also recently taken time out of their busy schedules to lead the masses in discussing the Draft Constitution. Zheng Xianghui, a suburban farmer elected as a District People's Representative, has been enthusiastically promoting the Draft Constitution to farmers in the fields and on the edges of the land these days.

    重庆市各区人民代表向选民宣传宪法草案
    重庆市各区人民代表正在选民中广泛宣传中华人民共和国宪法草案，并组织选民讨论。
    市内各区的人民代表，连日来正在居民中积极组织讨论和宣传。区人民代表皮文芳每天在市民们休息和乘凉的时候，就联系当地居民在国民党反动派统治时期所受压迫的实际事例，向大家宣传宪法草案和每个人的切身关系。被评为重庆市特等模范妇女工作者的区人民代表李嘉芸，在宪法草案公布后，就和当地的干部在一起组织了四十个读报组的群众进行座谈，还找了“时事手册”第十一号上登载的有关材料，给读报员和妇女积极分子讲课，并把报纸上登载的工业劳动模范和先进工作者发表的短文读给居民听，启发居民对宪法草案有更加明确的认识。人民代表吕碧仙这八九天来，经常跑到附近的地段借报纸找材料供居民阅读，给居民们讲解宪法草案的意义和内容。公私合营渝新纺织厂的几位人民代表，最近也在百忙中抽出时间领导群众讨论宪法草案。被选为区人民代表的郊区农民郑相辉，这几天来不论在田边、地角都热情地向农民们进行关于宪法草案的宣传。　（新华社）
