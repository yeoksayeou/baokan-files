Hunan Province is mobilizing the masses in some areas affected by pine caterpillar infestations to eradicate them. The Hunan Provincial People's Government has successively ordered 30,000 jin of 6% wettable "666" powder and equipped it with more than 200 sets of sprayers and spray guns, which have been distributed to Changsha, Hengyang, Dong'an, Qiyang and other places for pesticide control demonstrations, laying the foundation for future pesticide control. All pest-affected areas have also organized the masses to begin catching and beating the pests. Shuangming Township in Changsha mobilized rural labor other than rice transplanting, organized to catch insects, and eliminated 80% of the pests in 9,000 mu of infested land in just seven or eight days.

    湖南省组织群众防治松毛虫
    湖南省部分发生松毛虫害的地区，正在发动群众进行扑灭。湖南省人民政府已先后订购了百分之六可湿性“六六六”药粉三万斤，并配备喷雾器和喷枪二百多套，分配给长沙、衡阳、东安、祁阳等地进行药剂防治示范，为今后药剂防治打下基础。各虫害地区并已组织群众先后开始捕打。长沙双明乡动员了农村中插秧以外的劳动力，组织起来进行捕虫，仅七、八天工夫就除治了九千亩虫害，消灭害虫达百分之八十。
