The Northwest Administrative Committee's Animal Husbandry Bureau convened a symposium on livestock improvement for farmers and herders in the Northwest region from May 26th to 31st. The meeting reviewed and summarized the livestock improvement work of the past year and determined the future guidelines and tasks.

The meeting concluded that the livestock improvement work among farmers and herders over the past year had been successful. In the past year, animal husbandry cadres in various provinces have worked actively, improved breeding techniques, and improved more than 240,000 local sheep, more than 19,000 head of large livestock, and more than 170 local pigs. In the course of the work, relevant units used various opportunities and practical examples to further publicize the significance and benefits of improving livestock to farmers and herders, gradually reversing the conservative thinking of local people who were unwilling to improve local livestock breeds, and making them believe in science and technology. At the same time, various provinces also trained more than 300 artificial insemination cadres, and Gansu and Xinjiang provinces also taught artificial insemination techniques to 269 active farmers and herders, creating favorable conditions for continuing livestock improvement work in the future.

The meeting also criticized some incorrect ideas and practices in the past, such as: some places focused on the hybridization of excellent breeding stock and relaxed the work of massively increasing the number of livestock; some places focused on improving sheep and relaxed the improvement of large livestock; and, most importantly, they only focused on improving livestock breeds and did not pay attention to correspondingly improving feeding management. Some even misinterpreted breed improvement as simply introducing "foreign breeds" for hybridization, without attaching importance to selecting and breeding from local livestock breeds.

Based on the principle of developing and improving livestock and the actual conditions in various regions, the meeting determined the guidelines and steps for improving sheep, horses, and cattle, and determined that in 1954, the entire region would improve more than 336,000 sheep, more than 15,700 horses, and more than 9,200 cattle.

    西北畜牧局召开牲畜改良工作座谈会
    西北行政委员会畜牧局于五月二十六日至三十一日，召开了西北区农牧民牲畜改良工作座谈会。检查总结了一年来的牲畜改良工作，并研究确定了今后的方针任务。
    会议认为一年来的农牧民牲畜改良工作是有成绩的。一年来，各省畜牧干部积极努力、改进配种技术，改良了土种绵羊二十四万多只，大牲畜一万九千多头，还改良了土种猪一百七十多头。在工作过程中，有关单位利用各种机会，运用实际事例，进一步向农牧民宣传了改良牲畜的意义和好处，逐步扭转了当地群众不愿改良土种牲畜的保守思想，使他们相信了科学技术。同时，各省还培养了三百多个人工授精干部，甘肃、新疆两省并给二百六十九个农牧民积极分子教会了人工授精技术，为今后继续进行牲畜改良工作创造了有利条件。
    会议还批判了过去某些不正确的想法和做法，如：有些地方偏重了引用优良种畜的杂交，放松了大量发展牲畜数量的工作，有些地方偏重于改良绵羊，放松了对大牲畜的改良，特别重要的是只顾改良牲畜的品种，不注意相应地改善饲养管理，有的还把改良品种曲解成只是引用“外种”杂交，不重视土种牲畜中的选种选配。
    根据关于发展与改良牲畜的原则和各地实际情况，会议确定了改良羊、马、牛的方针、步骤，并确定一九五四年内全区改良绵羊三十三万六千多只，改良马一万五千七百多匹，牛九千二百多头。
