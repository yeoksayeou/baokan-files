How to Guide the Cultural Learning of Cadres Going to the Countryside
Hebei Zhuozhou County Office Cadre Spare-Time Cultural School

    The Hebei Zhuozhou County Office Cadre Spare-Time Cultural School has a total of 679 students, with a daily attendance of approximately 350 to 400 people, accounting for over 50% of the total student body. The number of absentees frequently ranges from 300 to 350. Among those absent, more than half are cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds. Because their practical work experience is relatively rich and they are capable of handling matters independently, they are frequently sent to the countryside. If there are urgent tasks, even more worker and peasant cadres are sent to the countryside.

    For several years, although worker and peasant cadres have participated in spare-time cultural learning, they often miss classes due to frequent trips to the countryside. Consequently, their knowledge is neither systematic nor consolidated. If we do not find a way to solve the learning problems of these cadres going to the countryside, many cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds will lose confidence in learning because they miss too many classes and cannot advance to the next grade in one or two years. Their cultural level will not improve, which will also affect the improvement of their work. Therefore, guiding the learning of cadres going to the countryside has become an important task in the teaching process of the cadre spare-time cultural school.

    Since 1952, we have paid attention to guiding the cultural learning of cadres going to the countryside. Our basic methods for guiding cadres going to the countryside are three: pre-lesson guidance, self-study, and make-up classes. When a large number of cadres go to the countryside, we adopt the methods of focused teaching and pre-lectures. Now, let's discuss each of these:

    (1) Pre-lesson Guidance – Before cadres go to the countryside, the teachers, according to the teaching plan, specifically arrange the progress, requirements, and homework for the courses to be studied during their time in the countryside, and provide a general explanation when necessary. If the time spent in the countryside is relatively long and the learning content is too much or too complex, and oral explanations are not easy to remember, self-study outlines are issued as a reference for self-study in the countryside. The self-study outlines are prepared in advance by the teachers according to the teaching units, clearly specifying the scope of study. They also highlight the key points of study and explain difficult problems, and provide answers to homework for important questions. If the time spent in the countryside is too long and the students have completed the content stipulated in the self-study outline, the teachers use the opportunity of the district correspondents going to the county every other day (or other methods) to regularly assign new lessons and distribute new lesson outlines, ensuring that cadres going to the countryside can conduct self-study with guidance.

    The benefit of pre-lesson guidance is that cadres can find time to self-study during their work in the countryside based on the progress and requirements of cultural learning. Because there is prior guidance, they will not be at a loss when studying.

    (2) Self-Study – Cadres going to the countryside mostly go deep into the villages and it is not easy to find teachers to help them, so they mainly rely on self-study. The self-study method is to independently study according to the learning tasks assigned by the teachers and the self-study outlines (or oral prompts). During self-study, they should take notes and do the homework assigned by the teachers. If they encounter problems they do not understand, they should ask others to explain or record them and write to the teachers at the original school for answers, or ask the teachers for make-up classes when they return.

    (3) Make-up Classes – There are three approaches to this.

    A. Scheduled Make-up Classes: In the past, make-up work was carried out sporadically, without a fixed time. Sometimes a teacher had to give several make-up classes in one day, which often affected normal teaching work. In 1953, the method of "scheduled make-up classes" was adopted, that is, students who missed classes would inform the teachers in advance by phone, orally, or in writing, stating which lessons they missed, which problems needed detailed explanations, and which problems needed prompts. Then, the teachers would prepare according to different situations and schedule a fixed time for make-up classes. Because the teachers were prepared in advance, they could generally make up for the key problems of a unit in about 30 minutes, saving half the time compared to the previous comprehensive make-up classes. This not only solved the students' difficult problems, but also prevented the teachers from being overworked, and the teaching effect was better. For example, in the seventh grade of elementary school arithmetic, there were 48 students, of whom 22 actually attended less than half the classes. Due to the adoption of the scheduled make-up class method, 16 students were promoted in half a year.

    B. Mutual Assistance Make-up Classes: Because there were many cadres going to the countryside and the teachers' time for make-up classes was limited, it was not easy to take care of everyone. Therefore, in units with a large number of students, make-up groups were organized based on subjects, and students were mobilized to help each other make up for classes during their rest time. The make-up groups were led by the homeroom teachers and relied on the active members of the students to give make-up classes to students who missed classes. This was very helpful for students who did not miss many classes. For example, Wu Yuntong, a student in the middle school Chinese class, missed ten days of classes and made them all up with the help of the mutual assistance group in the office.

    C. Teachers Go to the Students' Offices to Give Make-up Classes: Some cadres were far from the school and were too busy with work to come to the school for make-up classes, so the teachers would make an appointment with the students and go to the students' offices to give make-up classes. For example, five or six cadres from a certain public security station only attended classes at school for one-third of the time in half a year, mainly relying on self-study in the office and teachers going to give make-up classes to be promoted.

    (4) Focused Teaching and Pre-Lectures – Whenever central work arrived, a large number of cadres were sent to the countryside. For these cadres going to the countryside, we adopted two different methods to guide them according to different situations: A. When the cadres going to the countryside were relatively concentrated and there were conditions for collective classes, the county committee would separately stipulate study days, class times, and locations, and establish temporary study stations by area, with teachers going to the countryside regularly to provide focused teaching. For example, during the rural party rectification in 1952, the county transferred more than 200 cadres (including 45 cadres from county-level offices) to the second district for party rectification, and this method was adopted at that time. At that time, it was stipulated that every Friday would be a study day, with two hours of classes after breakfast in the morning. At the same time, five temporary study stations were established by area, and the county committee sent special personnel to lead them and designated full-time teachers to go to the countryside to provide focused teaching, so that more than 200 party rectification cadres maintained normal study and completed the one-and-a-half-month study task on schedule. B. Sometimes, although cadres were sent to the countryside in batches, they were scattered in various villages and there was no possibility of concentrated classes. At this time, the method of concentrated pre-lectures before going to the countryside was adopted. For example, in October 1952, 43 cadres from county-level offices were sent to the countryside to work on tax collection. Before departure, the school arranged learning tasks, put forward key points and requirements, and asked cadres to make notes for self-study after going to the countryside. The county committee also decided that the work group leader would be responsible for leading the study, and the group leader would check the learning progress at each centralized report. With such organized and led study, most cadres completed the learning tasks.

    According to our experience in the past two years, these methods of guiding cadres going to the countryside to study are all relatively effective. However, these methods should be combined with the actual situation and used flexibly. For example, students with a level below elementary school generally have low self-study ability, and make-up classes should be the main focus of their study in the countryside, with appropriate self-study tasks assigned. Students with a middle school level have stronger self-study ability and can focus on self-study, combined with appropriate make-up classes. At the same time, it should also be noted that regardless of the cultural level of the cadres going to the countryside, the content of their study in the countryside should be closely related to their actual work. Only in this way will the cadres' interest in learning be greater and the learning effect will be better.

    Correct guidance methods play a very important role in doing a good job in the cultural learning of cadres going to the countryside. However, the fundamental factor that determines whether the learning task can be completed lies in whether the cadres going to the countryside can consciously persist in learning. Generally, worker and peasant cadres have an urgent need to improve their culture, but some cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of cultural learning, or are unable to get rid of the difficulties in learning for a long time, and their enthusiasm for learning is not high. Therefore, while studying guidance methods, we also paid attention to the ideological leadership of cadres going to the countryside. In addition to positively publicizing the importance of cultural learning, we mainly use classroom teaching or written notices to commend cadres who have achieved good results in learning while working in the countryside, in order to educate the general public and motivate the backward. In the second half of 1952, Zhang Guizhe, deputy director of the Public Security Bureau, who persisted in learning and achieved good results in his work in the countryside, was commended in a notice. In 1953, persistence in learning during work in the countryside was listed as one of the conditions for evaluating models. In the same year, a total of 25 model students were selected from the whole school, half of whom persisted in learning during work in the countryside and achieved good results. Usually, teachers use classroom teaching to commend cadres who study well during work in the countryside at any time. Due to the correct use of the "more commendation" method, it has played a great role in boosting cadres' learning enthusiasm. For the specific ideological problems of individual cadres, we use individual assistance to solve them. For example, Sun Xintang, a student, lost confidence in learning in the second half of 1953 due to too many absences and being unable to keep up with the class. The teacher patiently educated him and encouraged him to study hard. On the other hand, the teacher carefully corrected his homework and commended him in time when he found a little progress. Therefore, his enthusiasm for learning was improved, he persisted in extracurricular learning, made up for half a year's homework, and his learning made significant progress.

    The completion of the learning tasks of county-level office cadres going to the countryside not only depends on the enthusiastic guidance of teachers, but also requires sufficient attention from the Party and government leaders. For example, Zhang Zhixiang, director of the County Health Hospital, often checks the learning of cadres in his unit and urges them to come to the school for make-up classes whenever cadres return to the county after going to the countryside. Therefore, the 27 students in the Health Hospital can generally persist in learning. In recent years, thanks to the help of Party and government leaders and the strong support of various offices, the work of guiding the cultural learning of cadres going to the countryside has made great progress. However, we know that leading comrades at all levels are busy with work and cannot have more time to study the work of spare-time schools. Therefore, we must also take the initiative to maintain close contact with various offices, report the situation in a timely manner, and strive for the leadership to strengthen the supervision and inspection of cadres' learning, so as to make the work better.

    On the basis of strengthening ideological leadership and adopting the guidance methods mentioned above, we have basically solved the problem of cadres going to the countryside to learn culture. At present, about 80% of the 679 cadres participating in cultural learning in the county can be promoted or graduate every year, basically overcoming the phenomenon of a large number of people falling behind due to frequent trips to the countryside. However, at present, there are still about 20% of cadres going to the countryside whose learning problems have not been completely solved due to heavy tasks or lack of learning consciousness. This remains to be addressed by our future efforts.

    怎样指导下乡干部的文化学习
    河北涿县机关干部业余文化补习学校
    河北涿县机关干部业余文化补习学校，共有学员六百七十九名，每天出席人数约三百五十人到四百人，占学员总数的百分之五十以上，缺课的人数经常有三百人到三百五十人。缺课人数当中，半数以上是工农出身的干部。因为他们的实际工作经验比较丰富，能够独当一面，所以经常要下乡。如果遇到突击任务，下乡的工农干部就更多了。
    几年来，工农干部虽然都参加了业余文化学习，但由于经常下乡，常常失去听课的机会，因而所得的知识既不系统，又不巩固。如果我们不想法解决这些下乡干部的学习问题，将会使不少工农出身的干部，因为缺课过多，一、二年升不了班，而丧失学习信心；他们的文化水平不能提高，也影响着工作的改进。因此，指导下乡干部学习，成了干部业余文化补习学校教学过程中的一项重要工作。
    从一九五二年起，我们就注意了对下乡干部文化学习的指导工作。我们指导下乡干部学习的基本方法是领课、自学和补课三种；如遇大批干部下乡时，则采取重点教学和预讲的办法。现在分别来讲一下：
    （一）领课——干部下乡前，教师按照教学计划，对干部下乡期间应学课程的进度、要求和作业，具体布置一下，必要时给以概括的讲解；如下乡时间较长和学习内容太多或太复杂，口头讲解不易记住时，即发给自学提纲，作为下乡自学的参考。自学提纲是教师按教学单元预先拟订的，明确地规定着学习范围。并提出学习重点和解释难懂问题，对重要问题还提示作业答案。如果下乡时间过长，学员学完了自学提纲所规定的内容，教师便利用区通讯员隔日上县的机会（或其他办法），定期布置新课，分发新课提纲，保证下乡干部能够有指导地进行自学。
    下乡领课的好处是：干部下乡后能根据文化学习的进度和要求，在工作中找时间进行自学，因预先有所提示，学习时可不致茫无头绪。
      （二）自学——干部下乡，大都深入到村，不易找到教员帮助，因此，主要依靠自学。自学方法是按照教师布置的学习任务和自学提纲（或口头提示）独立地进行自修。在自修时要做好笔记和教师布置的作业，遇到不懂的问题，即请别人解释，或记录下来函请原校教师解答，或等回来后提请教师补课。
      （三）补课——这有三种做法。
    甲、预约补课：过去的补课工作都是零星进行的，没有一定时间，有时一个教师一天要补几次课，因而常常影响到正常的教学工作。一九五三年改用了“预约补课”的办法，即由缺课学员，事先用电话、口头或书面告知教员，说明缺什么课，那个问题需要细讲，那个问题需要提示，然后由教师根据不同情况作好准备，统一规定时间进行补课。由于教师事先有所准备，一般用三十分钟左右，就能补齐一个单元的重点问题，较过去的全面补习可节省一半时间，这既能解决学员的疑难问题，教师也不致过分劳累，教学效果也比较好。如第七班学习高小算术的学员四十八人，其中有二十二人实际上课时间不足二分之一，由于采用预约补课办法，半年中已有十六人升了班。
    乙、互助补课：因为下乡干部较多，教师补课的时间有限，不易全面照顾，于是在学员人数较多的单位，以学科为主，组织补课小组，利用休息时间，发动学员互助补课。补课小组由班主任领导，依靠学员中的积极分子给缺课学员补课，这对缺课不多的学员帮助很大。如中学语文班学员吴云彤，缺了十天课，全是靠机关小组互助补齐的。
    丙、教师到学员所在机关补课：有的干部离学校较远，工作较忙，不能来校补课，教师便和学员约好，到学员所在机关去补课。如某公安派出所有五、六名干部，半年中只有三分之一的时间到校听课，主要依靠在机关自学和教师去补课而升了班。
    （四）重点教学和预讲——每逢中心工作到来，即有大批干部下乡，对这些下乡干部，我们针对不同情况，采取了两种不同的方式给以指导：甲、在下乡干部比较集中，有集体上课的条件时，县委便分别规定学习日、上课时间和地点，按片集中成立临时学习站，由教员定时下乡作重点教学。如一九五二年农村整党时，全县共抽调了二百多名干部
  （内有县级机关干部四十五名）集中到二区整党，那一次便是采用的这种方式。当时规定每星期五为学习日，上午早饭后上课两小时；同时分片成立五个临时学习站，县委派专人领导，并指定专职教员下乡作重点教学，使得二百多名整党干部，保持了正常学习，按期完成了一个半月的学习任务。乙、有时干部虽成批下乡，但分散在各村工作，没有集中上课的可能，这时便采取下乡前集中预讲的方式。如一九五二年十月份，县级机关有四十三名干部下乡作征收工作，在出发前，学校即布置了学习任务，提出重点和要求，让干部作好记录，以便下乡后进行自学。县委并决定由工作组长负责领导学习，每逢集中汇报时，由组长检查学习情况。这样有组织有领导地进行学习，大多数干部完成了学习任务。
    这几种指导下乡干部学习的方法，据我们两年来在工作中的体会，都是比较有效的。但这些方法应该结合实际，灵活运用。例如：高小以下程度的学员，一般是自学能力低，下乡学习应以补课为主，适当布置自学任务；中学程度的学员，自学能力较强，可以自学为主，适当结合补课。同时还应注意，无论下乡干部的文化程度如何，下乡学习的内容均应尽量结合实际工作；只有这样，干部的学习兴趣才会更大，学习效果才会更好。
    正确的指导方法，对搞好下乡干部的文化学习，有着很重要的作用。但是，决定学习任务能否完成的根本因素，还在于下乡干部能否自觉地坚持学习。一般工农干部，对提高文化的要求是迫切的，但也有部分干部由于对文化学习的重要性认识不足，或因长期摆脱不了学习中的困难，学习热情不高。因此，和研究指导方法同时，我们也注意了对下乡干部的思想领导。我们除了正面地宣传文化学习的重要性以外，主要通过课堂教学或书面通报，表扬下乡干部中坚持学习有成绩的干部，来教育一般，带动落后。一九五二年下半年通报表扬了下乡工作中坚持学习有成绩的公安局副局长张桂德；一九五三年并将下乡工作中坚持学习成绩列为评定模范的条件之一，同年全校共选出模范学员二十五名，其中有半数是在下乡工作中坚持学习获得成绩的。平时，教师通过课堂教学，随时表扬下乡工作中学习好的干部。由于正确地运用了“多表扬”的方法，对鼓舞干部学习情绪，起了很大作用。对于个别干部的具体思想问题，我们用个别帮助的方式来解决。如学员孙信堂，一九五三年下半年因缺课过多，跟不上班，丧失了学习信心，教师一方面耐心进行教育，鼓励他好好学习；另一方面对他的作业细心批改，发现一点进步，及时表扬。因此提高了他的学习热情，他坚持了课外学习，补齐了半年作业，学习有了显著进步。
    县级机关干部下乡学习任务的完成，不但要依靠教师热心指导，还必须有党、政领导方面的足够重视。例如县卫生院院长张趾祥，对本单位干部的学习，经常进行检查；每逢干部下乡回县，即督促到校补课。因而卫生院二十七名学员，一般都能坚持学习。几年来，由于党政领导方面的帮助和各机关的大力支持，使指导下乡干部文化学习的工作有很大开展。但是我们知道，各级领导同志工作较忙，不可能有更多的时间研究业余学校的工作，因此，我们还要主动地和各机关保持密切联系，及时反映情况，争取领导方面加强对于干部学习的督促检查，以便使工作做得更好。
    在加强思想领导的基础上，采用前面讲过的几种指导方法，我们基本上解决了下乡干部学习文化的问题。现在全县参加文化学习的六百七十九名干部，每年有百分之八十左右的人可以升班或结业，基本上克服了因经常下乡而大批掉队的现象。但是，目前还有百分之二十左右的下乡干部，由于任务繁重，或学习自觉性不强，学习问题还没有彻底解决，这有待我们今后的努力。
