    【Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 3rd】During this year's spring plowing production, the 132 agricultural technology promotion stations distributed throughout 86 counties (cities) in Shaanxi Province have been spreading agricultural technology reforms from point to area to more than 800,000 farmers, laying a reliable foundation for increasing agricultural production throughout the province this year.
    As early as last winter, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry first held nine training courses for agricultural technology cadres, taking the prefecture and Chang'an County as units. In addition to all 800-plus cadres from agricultural technology promotion stations, some district-level cadres and cadres from forestry, animal husbandry, and farms also participated in the study. The training lasted from two to three months. The trainees studied documents such as the general tasks of the state during the transition period and five kinds of teaching materials such as crop cultivation, and summarized past work, further improving everyone's political awareness and professional level. After the training, most of the cadres from agricultural technology promotion stations went to the countryside in a timely manner and promoted agricultural technology reforms in conjunction with spring plowing production.
    After this group of cadres went to the countryside, they cooperated with local cadres to focus on increasing grain and cotton production, selecting key agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and villages, and held various technical seminars, small exhibitions, field observation meetings, and technical learning meetings. They also transmitted technology to the broad masses of farmers through the people who participated in these meetings, or used local cadre meetings, mutual aid group leader training classes, temple fairs, and Spring Festival activities to widely promote agricultural technology reforms to the masses. Some areas also signed technical guidance contracts with agricultural cooperatives to ensure the effective implementation of agricultural technology reforms. Due to the adoption of various lively and vivid transmission methods, and the general principle of "taking materials locally and promoting them locally," selecting local examples of increased production experience to illustrate the benefits of improving agricultural technology, the broad masses of farmers were very interested and willing to accept it. In cotton-producing areas (mainly in Guanzhong), 43 agricultural technology promotion stations held cotton planting technology seminars, with more than 5,400 people participating, focusing on promoting the benefits of stabilizing cotton field acreage for the country and farmers themselves, and combined to study operating technologies such as sowing, cotton seed treatment, land preparation, moisture conservation, and rational fertilization. These more than 5,000 people returned and promoted and imparted this knowledge to cotton farmers, so many farmers dispelled the idea of ​​reducing cotton fields, not only actively expanding cotton fields, but also sowing early and improving cotton planting technology. It is estimated that the cotton field area in the province this year can reach more than 4.2 million mu, close to last year's level, and some areas have even exceeded it. Small-scale agricultural exhibitions held by 12 agricultural technology guidance stations were visited by more than 87,000 people. The exhibition held in Jingyang County also conducted field tests of horse-drawn agricultural implements, promoting the great future of agricultural collectivization and promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In rice-producing areas (mainly in southern Shaanxi), 12 agricultural technology promotion stations held rice operation seminars, with more than 2,100 participants, focusing on studying the "cultivating strong seedlings" method, eliminating the "cow hair seedlings" (seedlings that are not strong due to excessive seeds, as thin as cow hair, and take half a month to turn green after transplanting) in many areas, and universally cultivating "board seedlings" (seedlings that are strong and thick as a board, and turn green in six or seven days after transplanting). At present, rice is growing vigorously in many areas. Field observations organized by Dali, Yangxian and other counties have also achieved good results. Chang Taosheng, a farmer in Dali, used 666 pesticides to mix the seeds of wheat fields, and the number of seedlings per mu was almost doubled compared to wheat fields that were not treated with pesticides, and the growth was good. After many farmers observed in his fields, they overcame the negative emotions of "too many insects are difficult to treat" and "leaving it to fate." They said that they must use pesticides to mix seeds during autumn sowing this year.

    [Our Newspaper News] All parts of Fujian Province have successively held training classes for rural technicians before and after spring plowing. According to statistics from 53 counties and cities, more than 14,000 rural technicians in agriculture, animal husbandry, and special products have been trained. Most of these rural technicians are technicians from mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and some are mutual aid group leaders, production activists, old farmers, township cadres, and high school graduates who participate in agricultural production.
    The rural technicians from various places who have undergone training have played a backbone and driving role in this year's agricultural technology improvement work. Under the promotion of rural technicians in Shuangling Township, Tongan County, more than 9,800 jin of early rice was selected by salt water, accounting for 85% of the township's early rice sowing volume. After rural technicians in the 11th District of Jinjiang widely promoted the benefits of appropriate close planting, 11 townships and more than 800 mu of soybean fields in the district changed from spot planting to strip planting. Rural technicians in Xiaoruo Township, Minhou, also mobilized the masses to collect more than 2,000 dan of wild green manure, increasing organic fertilizer and reducing production costs by more than one million yuan.

    陕西省广泛推行农业技术改革
    福建在春耕前后训练农村技术员一万多名
    【本报西安三日电】在今年春耕生产中，分布在陕西省八十六县（市）中的一百三十二个农业技术推广站，由点到面地向八十多万农民传授了农业技术改革，给今年全省农业增产打下了可靠的基础。
    早在去年冬季，陕西省农林厅首先以专区和长安县为单位，举办了九个农业技术干部轮训班，除农业技术推广站全体八百多名干部外，并吸收了一部分区级干部和林业、畜牧、农场等干部参加学习。轮训时间两个月到三个月。学员们学习了国家在过渡时期的总任务等文件和农作物栽培等五种教材，并总结了过去的工作，大家的政治觉悟和业务水平进一步提高。轮训结束后，大部分农业技术推广站的干部及时下乡，结合春耕生产推行农业技术改革。
    这批干部下乡后，协同当地干部，根据当地具体生产内容，以粮棉增产为中心，选择重点的农业生产合作社、互助组和村庄，分别举行了各种技术座谈会、小型展览会、田间观摩会、技术学习会，并通过参加这些会议的人把技术传授给广大农民，或利用当地干部会议、互助组长训练班、庙会、春节活动，向群众广泛宣传农业技术改革；有些地区并与农业社订立技术指导合同，保证切实推行农业技术改革。由于采用了各种生动活泼的传授方式，并普遍地采取了“就地取材，就地推广”的原则，选择当地增产经验的事例，来说明改进农业技术的好处，广大农民很感兴趣并乐予接受。产棉区（主要在关中）有四十三个农业技术推广站分别召开了植棉技术座谈会，有五千四百多人参加，着重宣传了稳定棉田面积对国家和农民自己的好处，结合研究了播种、棉籽处理、整地、保墒、合理施肥等作业技术，这五千多人回去后又向棉农宣传与传授，因此许多农民打消了缩小棉田的打算，不仅积极扩大棉田，并提前下种，改进植棉技术。据估计，今年全省棉田面积可达四百二十万亩以上，接近去年的水平，有些地区并已超过。有十二个农业技术指导站举行的小型农业展览会，参观者达八万七千多人。泾阳县举办的展览会并作了马拉农具的实地试验，宣传了农业集体化的伟大前途，推动了互助合作运动。产稻区（主要在陕南）有十二个农业技术推广站召开了水稻作业座谈会，参加者二千一百多人，着重研究了“培育壮秧”法，消灭了不少地区的“牛毛秧”（因秧籽过多而秧苗不壮，细如牛毛，移栽后半月才能返青），普遍育成了“板板秧”
  （秧苗茁壮，厚实如板，移栽后六、七天即返青），目前许多地区的水稻生长健旺。大荔、洋县等县组织的田间观摩，也收到很好效果，大荔农民畅桃生用六六六药剂拌种的麦地，每亩出苗株数比不用药剂拌种的麦地几达一倍，生长良好。许多农民在他的地里观摩以后，克服了“虫多难治”、“听天由命”的消极情绪，他们表示今年秋播时一定要用药剂拌种。
    【本报讯】福建省各地在春耕前后相继举办农村技术人员训练班，根据五十三个县、市的统计，已训练了农业、畜产、特产等方面的农村技术员达
  一万四千多人。这些农村技术员大多是互助合作组织的技术员，有的是互助组长、生产积极分子、老农民、乡干部和参加农业生产的高小毕业生等。
    经过了训练的各地农村技术员，在今春农业技术改进工作中，起了骨干和推动作用。同安县双岭乡在农村技术员推动下，早稻采用盐水选种的有九千八百多斤，占全乡早稻播种量的百分之八十五。晋江十一区农村技术员广泛宣传适当密植的好处以后，全区有十一个乡八百多亩大豆田改点播为条播。闽侯小箬乡农村技术员还发动群众采集野生绿肥两千多担，增积了有机质肥料，又降低了生产成本一百多万元。
