Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 22nd (Shen Jiantu, special correspondent for this agency): The nine-nation delegations held a restricted meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd, paving the way for a complete agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina. The chief of the Chinese delegation hosted a banquet on the 21st for the heads and representatives of the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Kingdom of Laos, and the Kingdom of Cambodia, which was well noted here. Preparations for the meeting of the military command headquarters of Laos and Cambodia, either in Geneva or locally, have been completed, and talks will begin soon to produce interim or final reports on measures to cease hostilities within these two countries within three weeks.

The agreement reached on Laos and Cambodia on the 19th marks a new stage in the Geneva Conference, after which the conference will seek progress towards reaching agreements on the issues of all three Indochinese countries. The talks on Laos and Cambodia will proceed concurrently with the talks that began three weeks ago between the military representatives of both sides of Vietnam on the demarcation of troop regrouping areas. At the same time, representatives of the nine-nation delegations will begin to address the issue of ceasefire supervision and the political settlement necessary to guarantee lasting peace in Indochina.

The new stage of the conference emerged after the failure of the United States' plan to delay and obstruct the Geneva Conference from reaching an agreement.

Washington's pessimistic predictions about the conference "failing" and being interrupted did not come true. Washington was unable to use the downfall of the Laniel government to adjourn the conference indefinitely.

The second agreement on Indochina shattered Dulles' hope that "Britain now feels that all the possibilities that once existed in Geneva have disappeared, and therefore other methods should be considered." However, the conference is continuing. British newspapers find things more hopeful and report on the progress of the Geneva Conference.

The widespread support around the world for the constructive proposals of the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China disrupted the US timetable for ending the Geneva Conference while simultaneously ending the discussion on the Korean issue. The London magazine "New Statesman and Nation" pointed out: With this new proposal, "Western countries cannot end the Geneva Conference at this time. If they do, all of Asia will believe that they should bear the main responsibility for destroying the hope for peace."

The US delegation has been unable to prevent direct contact between the military command headquarters of the three Indochinese countries. For three weeks, it blocked the conference from reaching an agreement on the issue of direct military negotiations between the two sides in Vietnam on the cessation of hostilities. It failed, and after another three weeks, the second agreement paved the way for direct negotiations between the two sides in Laos and Cambodia on the cessation of hostilities. Preventing direct negotiations between the two sides is a key point in the US plan to obstruct an agreement by placing the entire process of the conference under direct US control.

On his way back to Washington, Smith attempted to prevent the new French Foreign Minister Mendès France from going to Switzerland immediately. US reports said that Smith opposed Mendès France's visit to Switzerland in Paris, while Eden expressed his approval.

The main purpose of the US timetable to obstruct the Geneva Conference from reaching an agreement is to buy time to intervene in Indochina, squeeze out France, and form a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc. However, the progress of the Geneva Conference shows that this timetable has been disrupted.

Smith's final instruction to his deputy, Johnson, was to stand firm. This apparently means that the US attitude is to create excuses and artificial disputes to obstruct the agreement. The "New York Herald Tribune"'s report on the 21st vaguely illustrated this, stating, "The United States feels that the conference has begun such a stage in which the US government only hopes to play a role slightly more than an observer."

US spokesmen do not hide the fact that if the plan to sabotage the negotiations fails due to the growing world public opinion demanding peace in Indochina and the increasing isolation of the United States, the US delegation will "disassociate" itself from the agreements reached. This is another indication of reserving the right to undermine the agreements reached in Geneva.

There are indications that Washington is stepping up pressure in Paris and Geneva to obstruct the achievement of a glorious solution acceptable to both sides. But apart from Washington's war planners, everyone recognizes that the proposals of Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, and Foreign Minister Molotov have laid the foundation for an agreement on the Indochina issue. The two agreements reached on Indochina show that if other delegations, especially the French delegation, truly want a ceasefire and peace in Indochina, the US obstruction at the conference can be shattered. The growing public opinion in France and around the world demanding an early end to hostilities in Indochina shows that international consultation, easing tensions, and consolidating peace are the most pressing issues of the moment. Washington cannot stop the rising tide of the world's demand for peace.

    新华社记者评日内瓦会议进入新阶段
    【新华社日内瓦二十二日电】本社特派记者沈建图报道：九国代表团在二十二日下午举行限制性会议，为在恢复印度支那和平问题上完全达成协议开辟道路。中国代表团首席代表二十一日设宴招待越南民主共和国、老挝王国和柬埔寨王国代表团的团长和代表，这在这里很受注意。老挝和柬埔寨双方军事司令部在日内瓦或在当地会晤的准备工作已经完成，会谈不久就将开始，以便在三个星期内就这两个国家境内停止敌对行动的措施拟出临时报告或最后报告。
    十九日在老挝和柬埔寨问题上达成的协议，标志着日内瓦会议进入了新阶段，此后会议将朝着在印度支那所有三国的问题上达成协议的方向求得进展。关于老挝和柬埔寨问题的会谈将和越南双方军事代表三星期前开始的关于划定军队集结地区的会谈同时进行。同时，九国代表团代表将着手解决停战的监督问题和对于保障印度支那持久和平所必需的政治解决问题。
    会议的新阶段，是美国拖延和阻挠日内瓦会议达成协议的计划遭到失败以后出现的。
    华盛顿的关于会议将“失败”、中断的悲观预言，没有成为事实。华盛顿没有能够利用拉尼埃政府的倒台来使会议无限期地休会。
    印度支那问题上的第二个协议，粉碎了杜勒斯的希望：“英国现在感到日内瓦所一度存在的一切可能性都已消失，因此该考虑其它办法了。”但是，会议却在继续进行。英国报纸觉得事情比较有了希望，并且报道了日内瓦会议的进展。
    越南民主共和国、苏联和中国代表团的建设性建议在全世界所获得的普遍支持，打乱了美国打算在破裂朝鲜问题的讨论的同时结束日内瓦会议的时间表。伦敦“新政治家与民族”杂志指出：有了这个新建议，“西方国家就不能在这个时候结束日内瓦会议。如果它们这样做的话，全亚洲都会认为它们应该对破坏了和平的希望负主要责任。”
    美国代表团没有能够阻挠得了印度支那三国的双方司令部进行直接接触。有三个星期之久，它阻挠会议就双方在越南停止敌对行动问题上进行直接军事谈判这一问题达成协议。它失败了，而在又是三个星期之后，第二个协议为双方在老挝和柬埔寨停止敌对行动问题上进行直接谈判开辟了道路。阻止双方进行直接的谈判，是美国的把会议整个进程放在美国直接控制之下以阻挠达成协议的计划的关键之点。
    史密斯在回华盛顿的途中，企图阻止法国新外交部部长孟戴斯—弗朗斯立即到瑞士去。美国的报道说：史密斯在巴黎反对孟戴斯—弗朗斯去瑞士，而艾登却表示赞成。
    美国阻挠日内瓦会议达成协议的时间表的主要目的，就是争取时间来插足印度支那，排挤法国并组成一个东南亚侵略集团。然而日内瓦会议的进展表明，这个时间表被打乱了。
    史密斯给他的副手约翰逊的最后指示是紧守不退。这显然是意味着，美国的态度是制造借口和人为的争端来阻挠协议。“纽约先驱论坛报”二十一日的消息隐约地说明了这一点，这家报纸说：“美国觉得会议已经开始了这样的一个阶段，在这个阶段里，美国政府只希望发挥略多于一个观察员的作用。”
    美国发言人并不隐讳这一点，就是假如由于要求印度支那和平的世界舆论日益强大和美国日益孤立而使破坏谈判的计划归于失败的话，美国代表团将和已经达成的协议“脱离关系”。这是保留破坏在日内瓦达成的协议的权利的又一个表示。
    有迹象说明，华盛顿正加紧在巴黎和日内瓦施加压力，以阻挠达成双方都能接受的光荣解决。但是除了华盛顿的战争策划人以外，大家都承认范文同代理外长、周恩来外长和莫洛托夫外长的建议已经为印度支那问题的协议奠定了基础。在印度支那问题上达成的两个协议说明：假如其他代表团，特别是法国代表团真正希望在印度支那停战和和平的话，美国在会议上的阻挠是能够粉碎的。法国和全世界要求早日停止印度支那敌对行动的日益强大的舆论说明：国际间进行协商和缓和紧张局势并巩固和平是当前最迫切的问题。华盛顿阻挡不了全世界要求和平的日益高涨的潮流。
