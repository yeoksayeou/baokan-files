    Southwest Begins Large-Scale Use of Silkworm Pupae for Oil Extraction
    The Southwest Silk Company has successfully trial-produced oil from silkworm pupae and has now begun large-scale production.
    In April of this year, the Southwest Silk Company conducted experiments on extracting oil from silkworm pupae in Chongqing. In the first trial pressing, the oil yield reached 22.2 percent, and in the second, the oil yield was 23.95 percent. The extracted oil was used as an industrial raw material by local leather factories, soap factories, and others, with good results. The pupa oil can be refined for edible purposes, and the pupa cake after oil extraction can be used as fertilizer. In order to achieve large-scale production of pupa oil, the company is currently studying the adoption of mechanized production. (Bi Liange)

    西南开始大量用蚕蛹榨油
    西南蚕丝公司试用蚕蛹榨油成功，现已开始大量生产。
    今年四月间，西南蚕丝公司在重庆市进行了用蚕蛹榨油的试验。第一次试榨，出油率达百分之二十二点二，第二次，出油率为百分之二十三点九五。榨出的油，经当地皮革厂、肥皂厂等试用作工业原料，效果很好。蛹油精炼后尚可食用，榨油后的蛹饼可作肥料。为了能大量生产蛹油，该公司现正研究采用机器生产。　（毕连阁）
