Shameful Provocation by American Interventionists
Li Baichao

Recently, the United States has intensified its hostile actions against the people of Guatemala, placing Guatemala under a serious threat of foreign armed intervention and creating tension in Latin America.

On May 17th, the U.S. State Department issued a provocative statement, fabricating the lie that "a large number of weapons were transported from Soviet-controlled territory to Guatemala," and clamoring that "this is a serious event." Then, it instructed the Nicaraguan ambassador to the United States to "suggest" that other Latin American countries act according to the wishes of the United States and discuss "possible steps to be taken." Subsequently, Nicaragua, Guatemala's neighbor, severed diplomatic relations with Guatemala, and Honduras, another neighbor of Guatemala, disregarding international norms, expelled three Guatemalan consuls and recalled its ambassador to Guatemala. Some Latin American government officials also issued provocative remarks against Guatemala. At the same time, the United States further signed so-called military assistance agreements with Nicaragua and Honduras, respectively, and rushed a large number of munitions to these two countries to threaten Guatemala with force. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles shamelessly threatened on May 25th: "If war breaks out in the Central American region, we expect to take collective action to stop (should read: launch) the war in accordance with treaty obligations."

The gentlemen in Washington are so furious that they have almost lost their reason. There has never been a more ridiculous and despicable excuse fabricated by these hegemons to interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries. To create war in Europe, they clamor about the so-called "Soviet threat to European security"; to expand intervention in the Indochina war, they clamor about the so-called "Communist expansion in Southeast Asia"; now they say that the "leader" of the "free world" itself is also being "threatened" by a small country in Latin America and needs to take "joint action" and resort to war.

The American interventionists have been racking their brains and exerting all their efforts for ten years to conquer Guatemala through various conspiracies. These facts have long been impossible to cover up with any lies.

Since the Guatemalan people overthrew the dictatorships of Ubico and his successor Ponce in 1944, especially after Arbenz was elected president in 1951, the Guatemalan government, driven by the masses, implemented a series of democratic measures to protect national interests, including implementing land reform and confiscating the land seized and monopolized by the American monopoly capital "United Fruit Company," known as the "Green Devil," which controls the economic lifeline of Central America, preventing it from carrying out economic plunder and interfering in Guatemala's internal affairs as it pleased. This angered the Wall Street tycoons and their agents, and the United States intensified its conspiracy to interfere in Guatemala.

From 1944 to 1950, the United States colluded with domestic landlords and reactionaries in Guatemala to launch more than 30 coup conspiracies. At the end of March 1953, 200 reactionaries organized a riot in Salamá. The interrogation proved that the "United Fruit Company" was the planner of this riot. After the United States's shameful subversive activities failed, it began preparing for direct armed intervention. Bradenton, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs, now in charge of external relations and a shareholder of "United Fruit Company," publicly advocated armed intervention in Guatemala in March 1953. At the Tenth Pan-American Conference held in Caracas in March of this year, the United States coerced most Latin American countries to pass a so-called "Anti-Communism Resolution" that created an excuse for U.S. armed intervention, stipulating that any American country that establishes a so-called "political system of a country outside the continent" would "endanger the peace of the Americas," and other American countries should take action to deal with it.

A few months ago, according to American newspapers, the U.S. State Department and the "United Fruit Company" began to organize some neighboring countries of Guatemala to prepare for joint armed intervention against Guatemala. Documents seized by the Guatemalan government proved that Colonel Stader, who was transferred from the U.S. Army to work for the "United Fruit Company," was responsible for training saboteurs. The "United Fruit Company" had established a weapons depot on a plantation along the Pacific coast, and the railroads of the Central American International Railway Company were prepared to transport invading troops. As the American "Business Week" said, these conspirators were only "waiting for an opportunity to overthrow the current government of Guatemala." Obviously, the American interventionists now believe that such an opportunity has arrived. According to the Associated Press, the series of interventionist actions openly taken by the United States this time is to test the "sentiment" of Latin American countries towards "discussing a course of action" in order to "accelerate a showdown on the entire situation in Guatemala."

The American conspiracy to interfere in Guatemala's internal affairs has once again exposed the vicious face of American neo-colonialists. The American ruling clique boasts that it is the defender of the "independence," "freedom," and "democracy" of all countries in the capitalist world, but in reality, it wants to encompass all countries in the world into its colonial empire, where it dominates the fate of the people of all countries; otherwise, it will conquer them. This is the true face of the American "free world" and the so-called "common security" system.

However, the Guatemalan government, which upholds national independence and sovereignty, has shown no compromise against the aggressive threat of American interventionists. The Guatemalan Foreign Ministry issued a statement on May 21, sternly refuting the excuses made by the United States for intervention, pointing out: "Guatemala has never negotiated with the Soviet Union or Poland to purchase arms. …However, the government emphatically states that even if it purchased such things, no one can interfere with its legitimate right to freely purchase from any country in the world. Guatemala is not an American territory that must obtain prior approval from the United States when purchasing arms necessary for its defense and security; therefore, it opposes the intention of the U.S. government to supervise the legitimate actions of a sovereign government." At the same time, all sectors of the Guatemalan people unanimously expressed their firm resistance to any American intervention.

The Guatemalan people's struggle against foreign intervention and to safeguard their national independence has gained the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of people in Latin America. Public opinion in various countries has condemned and opposed the U.S.-planned armed intervention, believing that it is a threat to the independence of all Latin American countries. Uruguay's "Debate" newspaper condemned the American conspiracy as "merely provoking war to protect commercial interests that have nothing to do with Latin America"; Argentina's "Democracy" newspaper also pointed out that the American attitude towards Guatemala is unpopular. Peace-loving people and all upright people around the world cannot allow the U.S. intervention in Guatemala's internal affairs and the aggressive act of war threats to succeed.

    美国干涉者的可耻挑衅
    李白超
    最近以来，美国变本加厉地采取了一系列敌视危地马拉人民的行动，使危地马拉面临着外国武装干涉的严重威胁，并造成了拉丁美洲的紧张局势。
    五月十七日，美国国务院发表了一项挑衅性的声明，凭空捏造所谓“有大批武器从苏联控制的领土运往危地马拉”的谎言，大嚷大叫“这是一个严重的事件”。然后就指使尼加拉瓜驻美大使“建议”其他拉丁美洲国家按照美国的意旨行事，商讨“采取可能的步骤”。接着，危地马拉的邻国尼加拉瓜就和危地马拉断绝了外交关系，危地马拉的另外一个邻国洪都拉斯也竟然不顾国际常规，驱逐了危地马拉的三个领事，并召回驻危地马拉的大使。其他某些拉丁美洲国家政府人士也对危地马拉发出了挑衅的言论。同时，美国进一步和尼加拉瓜及洪都拉斯两国分别签订了所谓军事援助协定，用飞机赶运了一大批军火到这两个国家去，以对危地马拉进行武力威胁。美国国务卿杜勒斯五月二十五日公然无耻地恫吓说：“假如战争在中美洲地区爆发的话，我们期望依照条约义务，采取集体行动来制止
  （应读作发动）战争。”
    华盛顿老爷们的暴跳如雷，几乎丧失了理性。再没有像这些称王称霸者在干涉拉丁美洲国家内政上所捏造的借口，更令人可笑而又可鄙的了。他们为了在欧洲制造战争，叫嚷所谓“苏联威胁欧洲安全”；他们为了扩大干涉印度支那战争，叫嚷所谓
  “共产党在东南亚扩张”；现在他们说，“自由世界”的“领导者”自己也受到拉丁美洲一个小国的
  “威胁”，需要采取“联合行动”诉诸战争了。
    美国干涉者为了要征服危地马拉，已经进行了十年之久的种种阴谋活动，伤透了脑筋，使尽了力气。这些事实早就不是任何谎言所能掩盖的了。
    自一九四四年危地马拉人民推翻了乌必可及其后继者彭斯的独裁政权，特别是一九五一年阿本斯当选总统以后，由于危地马拉政府在人民大众的推动下，实行了一系列保护民族利益的民主措施，包括实行土地改革，没收了控制着中美经济命脉、有“绿色魔鬼”之称的美国垄断资本“联合果品公司”所强占和垄断的土地，使它不能为所欲为地进行经济掠夺和干涉危地马拉的内政，这就激怒了华尔街的大亨及其代理人，美国便加紧进行对危地马拉的干涉阴谋。
    从一九四四年到一九五○年期间，美国就曾勾结危地马拉国内的地主和反动分子发动过三十多次政变的阴谋。一九五三年三月底，又有二百个反动分子在萨拉马组织暴动，经审讯结果证明，“联合果品公司”是这次暴动的策划者。美国制造这些可耻的颠覆活动都告失败后，就开始准备进行直接的武装干涉。前美国负责拉丁美洲事务的助理国务卿、现在是“联合果品公司”对外关系负责人与股东布莱敦，在一九五三年三月曾公开主张对危地马拉实行武装干涉。今年三月在加拉加斯召开的第十届泛美会议上，美国胁迫拉丁美洲大多数国家通过了替美国武装干涉制造借口的所谓“反对共产主义决议”，规定任何一个美洲国家如建立了所谓“大陆以外国家的政治制度”，就是“危害美洲和平”，其他美洲国家就应采取行动来对付。
    几个月前，据美国报刊透露，美国国务院和“联合果品公司”就开始组织危地马拉的一些邻国准备对危地马拉采取联合的武装干涉行动。危地马拉政府查获的文件证明了从美国军队中调到“联合果品公司”工作的斯塔德上校在负责从事训练破坏分子的工作，“联合果品公司”在太平洋沿岸的一个种植园里已建立了武器贮藏库，中美国际铁路公司的铁道则准备用来运输侵犯军。正如美国“商业周刊”所说的，这些阴谋家只“一心等待机会来推翻危地马拉现政府”。显然美国干涉者现在认为这样的时机已经到来了。据美联社透露说：美国这次公开采取的一系列干涉行动，是要试探拉丁美洲国家对
  “商讨采取某种行动方针”的“情绪”，以便“加速对危地马拉整个情势进行摊牌。”
    美国干涉危地马拉内政的阴谋，又一次暴露了美国新殖民主义者的凶恶面目。美国统治集团口口声声夸耀自己是资本主义世界各国“独立”、“自由”、“民主”的保卫者，但实际上是要把世界各国都囊括到它的殖民帝国里面去，由它来支配各国人民的命运，否则都要加以征伐。这就是美国所谓“自由世界”，所谓“共同安全”体系的真实面貌。
    但是，维护国家独立主权的危地马拉政府，对美国干涉者的侵略威胁，表示不屈。危地马拉外交部五月二十一日发表声明，严正地驳斥了美国为了进行干涉而制造的借口，指出：“危地马拉从来没有在苏联或波兰谈判购买军火。……但是政府着重地声明：即使它购置了这种东西，也没有人能过问它，从世界上任何国家自由采购的合法权利。危地马拉不是在购置它的防务与安全所必需的军火时要事先得到美国批准的一个美国的属地，因此，它反对美国政府想要监督主权政府的合法行为的意图。”同时，危地马拉各阶层人民一致表示坚决反抗美国的任何干涉行为。
    危地马拉人民为反对外国干涉、维护自己民族独立的斗争获得了拉丁美洲广大人民的热烈支援。各国舆论纷纷谴责和反对美国在策划中的武装干涉，认为是对所有拉丁美洲国家独立的威胁。乌拉圭的“辩论报”斥责美国的阴谋“仅仅是为了保护和拉丁美洲毫不相干的商业利益而挑拨战争”；阿根廷的“民主报”也指出：美国对危地马拉的态度是不得人心的。全世界爱好和平的人民和一切正直人士都不能容许美国干涉危地马拉内政，并进行战争威胁的侵略行为得逞。
