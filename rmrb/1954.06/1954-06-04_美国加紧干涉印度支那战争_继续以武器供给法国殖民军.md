Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd: The United States is continuing to supply French colonial forces with airplanes and ships, intensifying its interference in the Indochina War.

    Reuters reported: A French military authority spokesman said that the United States has recently sent more aircraft. According to United Press International: On May 28th, the American aircraft carrier "Windham Bay" arrived in Saigon. The ship unloaded seventeen Panda fighter-bombers to supply the French forces.

    The United States has also decided to supply the French forces with seven landing craft. According to reports, most of these landing craft will be sent to the North Vietnamese battlefield for amphibious or riverine landing operations.

    Associated Press reported: French military sources revealed that the U.S. Air Force is preparing to transport three battalions of French troops from North Africa to the Indochina front. Not long ago, the U.S. Air Force transported French troops to Indochina twice.

    At the same time, the United States is stepping up its use of the Japanese military industry as an arsenal for intervening in the Indochina War. Recently, the U.S. Far East Air Force authorities ordered 35,000 napalm bombs for the Indochina battlefield from Japanese military manufacturers. Japanese military suppliers such as Toyo Aviation Industry Co. have signed contracts to manufacture and repair military aircraft for the Bao Dai and Khmer puppet regimes. In addition, Japanese military companies have also contracted to build artillery, landing craft, and large quantities of ammunition and rockets for the Indochina War.

    Kyodo News reported: Japanese arms dealers estimate that with the intensification of U.S. intervention in the Indochina War, "new special procurement orders may become active."

    美国加紧干涉印度支那战争
    继续以武器供给法国殖民军
    据新华社三日讯：美国正继续以飞机、舰艇供给法国殖民军，干涉印度支那战争。
    路透社报道：法军当局发言人说，美国最近已送去了更多的飞机。据合众社消息：五月二十八日，美国航空母舰“温汉湾号”到达西贡。该舰卸下十七架熊猫式战斗轰炸机供给法军。
    美国方面又决定供给法军登陆艇七艘。据报道，这些登陆艇中的大部分将派到北越战场，用来进行海上或河上的登陆战。
    美联社的消息说：法军方面透露，美国空军准备从北非赶运法军三个营到印度支那前线。在不久以前，美国空军就曾两次把法军运往印度支那。
    美国同时也加紧利用日本军火工业做干涉印度支那战争的兵工厂。最近，美国远东空军当局向日本军火制造商订购了三万五千枚供应印度支那战场的凝固汽油弹。日本东洋航空工业公司等军火商签订了为保大和高棉傀儡政权制造和检修军用飞机的合同。此外，日本军火公司还承造了供应印度支那战争的炮、登陆艇和大量弹药和火箭弹。
    共同社说：日本军火商估计随着美国干涉印度支那战争的加紧，“新特需订货可能活跃起来”。
