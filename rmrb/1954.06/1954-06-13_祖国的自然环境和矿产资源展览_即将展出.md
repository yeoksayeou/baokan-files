The "Exhibition of the Motherland's Natural Environment and Mineral Resources," organized by the Preparatory Office of the Central Museum of Natural History, under the Central Ministry of Culture, with the active assistance of relevant departments, will be open to the public in the Wenhua Hall of the Forbidden City starting June 15th.

The content arrangement and specimen model collection design of the exhibition hall are closely integrated with the general tasks of the country's transition period, vividly introducing our country's superior natural environment and rich underground resources. The exhibition hall is divided into three exhibition halls, which respectively introduce the natural environment of our country, the resources of steel, non-ferrous metals, non-metallic minerals, coal, and oil. The exhibits in all exhibition halls, in addition to some original mineral specimens and illustrations of their smelting process; special models illustrate the distribution of our country's terrain, rainfall, temperature, soil, rivers and water conservancy projects, plants, animals, aquatic products, and various metal and non-metal minerals. Through the schematic diagrams of these models, people can clearly see the magnificent face of the motherland's "vast land and abundant resources" on the map of the motherland.

In the exhibition hall, automated models of the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 7 blast furnace, large rolling mill, and seamless steel pipe plant are also displayed; in the coal exhibition hall, a model of China's first giant Fushun open-pit mine is also displayed. In particular, in the exhibition section of all mineral resources, models are used to show the development of China's geological drilling industry in recent years, illustrating that our country's scientific and technological level in using natural resources for the benefit of the people is rapidly increasing. The distribution map of China's rivers and water conservancy projects fully demonstrates the great achievements of the hardworking and brave Chinese people in carrying out water conservancy construction under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

The public opening of this exhibition hall is a very meaningful good news in the cultural life of the people of the capital. The Preparatory Office of the Central Museum of Natural History held five previews in mid-May and late May, inviting the heads of central, North China, and Beijing-level agencies, democratic parties, and people's organizations to visit. More than 1,800 visitors attended. The visitors put forward many valuable opinions on the exhibition, and the Preparatory Office of the Central Museum of Natural History improved it according to these opinions; at the same time, a mass work group was specially set up for the opening of the exhibition hall, and interpreters were trained.

The preparation work for this exhibition took more than half a year. During this period, the Preparatory Office of the Central Museum of Natural History has always closely cooperated with nine units including the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, and the Central Ministry of Geology. All units provided information, collected specimens, designed and produced models for the exhibition hall, and even provided various aspects of sponsorship in the layout of the exhibition hall, so that the exhibition hall can be opened to the public relatively perfectly; in particular, this close cooperation between various departments has created a good example for the development of museum work in our country in the future.

    “祖国的自然环境和矿产资源展览”即将展出
    中央文化部所属中央自然博物馆筹备处筹办的“祖国的自然环境和矿产资源展览”，在各有关部门的积极帮助下，六月十五日起将在故宫文华殿公开展出。
    展览馆的内容安排和标本模型的采集设计，紧密地结合着国家过渡时期的总任务，生动地介绍了我国优越的自然环境和丰富的地下资源。展览馆分三个陈列馆，分别介绍了我国的自然环境、钢铁、有色金属、非金属矿产、煤和石油等资源情况。全部展览馆中的陈列品，除一部分原矿物标本及其冶炼过程的图示外；我国的地形、雨量、气温、土壤、河流及水利工程、植物、动物、水产，以及各种金属、非金属矿产的分布状况都有特制的模型说明。人们通过这些模型的示意，可以在祖国的版图上清楚地看到祖国“地大物博”的雄伟面貌。
    在展览馆中，还同时陈列着我国钢都鞍山的七号高炉、大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂三大工程的自动化模型；在煤的展览馆中，还陈列了我国第一个巨大的抚顺露天矿场模型。特别是在所有矿产资源的陈列部分，都用模型显示了近几年来我国地质钻探事业的发展，说明我国运用自然资源为人民谋福利的科学、技术水平正在迅速增长。我国河流及水利工程的分布图，更充分显示了勤劳勇敢的中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，进行水利建设的巨大成就。
    这个展览馆的公开展出，在首都人民文化生活中是一件极有意义的喜讯。中央自然博物馆筹备处在五月中、下旬内，曾先后举行过五次预展，邀请中央、华北和北京市级各机关、各民主党派、人民团体的负责人前往参观。参观者达一千八百多人。参观者对展览会提出了许多宝贵意见，中央自然博物馆筹备处根据这些意见加以改进；同时还为展览馆的开放专门设置了群众工作组，训练了解说员。
    这次展览的筹备工作，前后共用了半年多的时间。在此期间内，中央自然博物馆筹备处始终与中央重工业部、中央燃料工业部、中央地质部等九个单位密切合作，各单位为展览馆提供资料、采集标本、设计及制作模型，甚至在展览馆的布置方面都给与各方面的赞助，使得展览馆能够比较完满地公开展出；特别是这种各部门的密切合作，给今后我国博物馆工作的开展，开创了一个良好的范例。
