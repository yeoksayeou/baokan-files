    Temurbagan (Mongolian), a member of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said: "I read the Draft Constitution with excitement. It summarizes the revolutionary achievements of all ethnic groups in the motherland and reflects the common aspirations of all ethnic groups. I believe that the people of Inner Mongolia, who are engaged in intensive industrial construction and agricultural and pastoral production, will actively participate in discussions and wholeheartedly support it."

    Zhu Dehai (Korean), Chairman of the People's Government of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region in Jilin Province, said in his speech that the Draft Constitution points out the bright future for all ethnic groups and inspires our enthusiasm for construction.

Guo Ji Mugu said, "Our Yi people used to be oppressed by reactionary rulers, living in remote mountains, unable to see the great rivers and mountains of the motherland. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we have obtained equal rights. The content of the now announced Draft Constitution is consistent with our interests. I must firmly remember it, go back and promote it well, call on the Yi people to discuss it, and strengthen unity, and work hard to produce to thank Chairman Mao for his care."

    Zhao Cunxin (Dai), Chairman of the People's Government of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region, Dao Jingban (Dai), Chairman of the People's Government of the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Region, Lei Chunguo (Jingpo), Vice Chairman, Li Hecai (Hani), Chairman of the Consultative Committee of the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region, Hu Zhonghua (Kawa), Deputy Commissioner of the Mianning Special District, Pei Aqian (Lisu), Vice Chairman of the People's Government of the Bijiang Lisu Autonomous Region, and Naxi and Wanbao from the border areas of Yunnan Province, also made speeches and unanimously expressed their welcome and support for the promulgation of the Draft Constitution.

The Communist Party and the People's Government help us ethnic minorities by doing what they say. The promulgation of the Draft Constitution will further encourage the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas to love the motherland. Lei Chunguo said in his speech that the lives of the Jingpo people have gradually improved after the implementation of regional autonomy. The Draft Constitution clearly stipulates the autonomous rights of ethnic minorities. I represent the Jingpo people and express my full support. Hu Zhonghua said excitedly: "I participated in the discussion of the initial draft of the Constitution and felt very honored. The Draft Constitution records what is in our hearts. After I go back, I will explain the spirit of the Draft Constitution to the Kawa people well." They also unanimously expressed in their speeches that when they return to the border areas, they will further strengthen national unity and consolidate national defense.

In recent years, the people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province have received various assistance such as the distribution of agricultural tools from the People's Government, and are changing the backwardness of the mountainous areas. When they see the Draft Constitution, they will be infinitely joyful and even more grateful to Chairman Mao.

    Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan), Vice Chairman of the Northwest Administrative Committee of the Northwest Region and Chairman of the People's Government of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region in Gansu Province, said that Article 3 of the General Program of the Draft Constitution stipulates that the People's Republic of China is a unified multi-ethnic country, stipulates the rights of ethnic minorities, and stipulates the freedom to maintain or reform their customs and religious beliefs, which fully conforms to the interests of the people of all ethnic groups, and I fully support it.

This will give great encouragement to the people of ethnic minorities. Badierhan (Kazak), member of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, said that our Kazak people used to be oppressed by reactionary rulers, and the number of livestock continued to decrease. Some people were still wandering around. Now, with the help of the People's Government, the number of livestock has increased year by year, and the wanderers have also settled down. In the future, Xinjiang will also establish a Kazak Autonomous Region. Today, the Draft Constitution has fixed the rights of national autonomy, and the development of all ethnic groups is more guaranteed, and we fully support it.

    Ma Teng'ai (Hui), Vice Chairman of the People's Government of Ningxia Province, said in his speech that the people of all ethnic groups will wholeheartedly support the Draft Constitution.

Today, the Draft Constitution, which summarizes the revolutionary achievements of the people across the country and reflects the aspirations of the people, has been promulgated, and the Zhuang people must be jubilant and discuss it enthusiastically. Lan Changfa (Yao), member of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, said that in the past, most of the Yao people in the Central South region lived in mountainous areas. Since liberation, the People's Government has helped more than 20,000 people move to the plains for production, and their lives have improved. The Draft Constitution points out the future of ethnic minorities. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and with the help of the Han people, our Yao people will develop faster.

    Wang Guoxing (Li), Chairman of the People's Government of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region in Guangdong Province, said: "I am honored for the promulgation of the Draft Constitution of our great motherland."
