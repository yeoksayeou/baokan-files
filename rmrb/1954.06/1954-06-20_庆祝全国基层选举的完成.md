    Celebrating the Completion of National Grassroots Elections
    The great election campaign carried out in grassroots units in cities and villages across the country has been victoriously completed. This is a major event in the political life of our people, marking the increasing expansion of the scope of our people's democratic life and the increasing ability of the people to manage state affairs. At the same time, its successful completion has laid a solid foundation of people's democracy for the people's congresses at the county level and above and the National People's Congress.
    During the grassroots elections, population surveys and voter registration were universally carried out in various regions. Thanks to in-depth publicity and mobilization, the population survey work gained the active support of the broad masses, thus basically meeting the requirements of no duplication, no omission, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. According to statistics, China's population has grown significantly, with the total population exceeding 600 million. The population survey work directly facilitated the grassroots elections; moreover, with accurate population figures, it provided a reliable basis for the country's planned economic construction.
    The broad masses of people conducted strict reviews of voter qualifications during voter registration. The masses actively exposed and denounced landlords and counter-revolutionaries who concealed their class status, feigned activism, and attempted to steal electoral rights; and for those landlord class elements who had undergone more than five years of labor reform, obeyed government decrees, and had no reactionary behavior, their class status was changed according to law, granting them electoral rights; those under supervision who had reformed better were given shortened terms, and those under supervision who had reformed even better were had their supervision removed and were given electoral rights. Through voter registration, the broad masses once again received class education and enhanced their revolutionary vigilance. The fact that landlord class elements can change their class status through hard work and that those under supervision can have their supervision removed through law-abiding tests pointed out more clearly the path of self-reform and becoming new people to those landlord class elements and those under supervision who have not yet obtained electoral rights.
    During the grassroots elections, the broad masses, through various means, conducted strict inspections and evaluations of the work of grassroots state administrative organs and grassroots cadres, and the broad cadres received a profound democratic education. Individual bad elements who had occupied grassroots state administrative organs and committed wrongdoings were removed by the masses. Cadres with shortcomings were criticized by the masses and urged to correct them; cadres with achievements in their work and a democratic style were praised by the masses and continued to be supported by the masses and were elected as people's representatives. According to statistics from many regions, grassroots cadres elected as people's representatives accounted for more than 70% of the total number of grassroots people's congress representatives, which shows that the vast majority of grassroots cadres faithfully serve the people and are supported by the people. In the elections, voters paid close attention to advanced elements in socialist construction and socialist transformation, and with great trust, elected model workers in industry and agriculture, organizers and leaders in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and outstanding people in other fields as representatives, many of whom are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. Among the representatives elected in various regions, the number of women averaged more than 17%.
    People of all ethnic groups further enhanced their political awareness during the grassroots elections, fully recognized the importance of being masters of their own affairs, actively participated in the elections, and solemnly exercised their electoral rights, so the number of voters who participated in the voting reached more than 85% of the total number of voters, with many regions as high as more than 90%, and some regions even reaching 100%. These percentages demonstrate the political enthusiasm of the people and also demonstrate the broad democratic nature of our country's electoral system.
    The increase in the people's political enthusiasm has brought about a surge in production enthusiasm, and the grassroots elections have powerfully promoted production and construction and other tasks. In 32 state-owned, locally state-owned, and jointly state-private enterprises in Beijing, workers launched production competitions during the grassroots elections, completing the quarterly production plan more than a month ahead of schedule. In 353 townships in 10 counties of the Changzhi Special District in Shanxi Province, a total of 349 new agricultural production cooperatives were established and more than 1,100 mutual aid groups were developed during the grassroots election campaign. These are just individual examples of countless facts.
    Through the grassroots elections, the people removed those they were dissatisfied with from the grassroots state administrative organs, increased the number of outstanding representatives who emerged from the masses, the ideological style of grassroots cadres was greatly improved under the supervision of the people, the enthusiasm for building socialism was further enhanced, many villages with relatively weak work were transformed or rectified, and various institutions and systems were also improved, thus greatly improving the work efficiency of grassroots state administrative organs, the people trusted the Communist Party and the government more, and the relationship between the masses and cadres became more harmonious. The new atmosphere of grassroots state administrative organs after the elections will play a huge role in the country's various construction tasks in the future.
    The result of the grassroots elections is that the state power organs and state administrative organs have been further strengthened and further democratized. Therefore, all grassroots cadres must be good at grasping and utilizing the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the people in the grassroots elections, continue to improve and do a good job in the work of grassroots state administrative organs, especially to hold good people's congress meetings and consolidate the people's congress system. The political basis for doing all our work well is to rely on the broad masses of the people, promote democracy, and concentrate the wisdom and strength of the masses. The grassroots people's congress is the grassroots state power organ, which can most fully express the will of the people and can also best unite and organize the broad masses, improve production, and improve work. After the grassroots elections, people's congress meetings have generally been held and have achieved good results; but some regions have not held them well enough. This should be improved. Regions that have not held them well should sum up their experiences and lessons, absorb the advanced experiences of other regions, and hold good grassroots people's congress meetings.
    Now, the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China has been published and submitted to the people of the whole country for discussion. The grassroots organizations of state power organs and state administrative organs must mobilize and organize all the people to enthusiastically participate in this discussion, collect the opinions of the masses, and through the propaganda of the constitution, enhance the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the masses.
    In order to hold good grassroots people's congress meetings and consolidate the people's congress system, it is also necessary to constantly help people's representatives strengthen their ties with the people, so that people's representatives establish a clear concept of being responsible to the voters and being directly supervised by the voters. The main responsibility of the people's representatives lies in constantly contacting the voters, listening to the opinions of the masses, helping the masses solve difficulties, and reflecting the opinions of the masses to the state administrative organs in a timely manner. For important opinions and demands of the masses, they should be made into proposals and submitted to the people's congress meetings for discussion and resolution. After the end of the grassroots elections, some regions have paid attention to the regular assistance to people's representatives, providing convenience for the work of people's representatives in all aspects, enhancing the prestige of the representatives, and organizing representatives to work and study. These experiences should be carefully summarized and promoted.
    The grassroots organizations of state power organs and state administrative organs and their daily activities occupy a very important position in national life. Grassroots organizations have direct contact with the people every day and every hour; all the principles and policies of the Party and all the laws and measures of the government are realized through grassroots organizations. Therefore, we must repeatedly emphasize that after the grassroots elections, all regions must continue to strengthen the leadership of grassroots work, strengthen the education and assistance to grassroots cadres, so that they can all clearly recognize the glory and importance of their positions, actively do a good job in various tasks, and on the basis of the great victory of the grassroots elections, greatly promote the work of the grassroots state power organs and state administrative organs.

### 庆祝全国基层选举的完成

    庆祝全国基层选举的完成
    在全国城市和乡村基层单位进行的伟大的选举运动，已经全部胜利地完成了。这是我国人民政治生活中的一件大事，它标志着我国人民民主生活的范围日益扩大，人民管理国家事务的能力日益提高。同时，它的胜利完成，还为县以上地方各级人民代表大会和全国人民代表大会奠定了坚实的人民民主的基础。
    在基层选举中，各地普遍进行了人口调查和选民登记工作。由于进行了深入的宣传动员，人口调查工作取得了广大群众的积极支持，因而基本上达到了不重复、不遗漏、全面和确实的要求。根据统计，我国人口有了显著的增长，人口总数已超过六亿。人口调查工作直接便利了基层选举的进行；而且因为有了确实的人口数字，对于国家进行有计划的经济建设，提供了可靠的依据。
    广大人民在选民登记工作中进行了严格的选民资格审查。群众积极揭发和检举了隐瞒成份、伪装积极、图谋窃取选举权利的地主阶级分子和反革命分子；而对于那些经过五年以上劳动改造而又服从政府法令、没有任何反动行为的地主阶级分子，依法改变了他们的成份，给予了选举权利；对改造得较好的被管制的分子，予以缩短期限，对改造得更好的被管制分子，则取消管制并给予选举权利。通过选民登记工作，广大人民又一次地受到了阶级教育，提高了革命的警惕性。地主阶级分子经过辛勤的劳动可以改变成份、被管制分子经过守法的考验可以取消管制的事实，给尚未获得选举权利的地主阶级分子和被管制分子更加明确地指出了他们自我改造重作新人的道路。
    在基层选举中，广大群众通过各种方式对基层国家行政机关的工作和基层干部进行了严格的考察和评议，广大干部受到了一次深刻的民主教育。个别窃踞在基层国家行政机关中为非作歹的坏分子，被群众剔除了出去。有缺点的干部，受到群众批评而且被督促改正；工作有成绩、作风民主的干部，受到群众的表扬，并受到群众的继续拥护而当选为人民代表。根据许多地区的统计，基层干部被选为人民代表的约占基层人民代表大会代表总数的百分之七十以上，这说明了绝大多数基层干部是忠实地为人民服务并为人民群众所拥护的。在选举中，选民十分注意在社会主义建设和社会主义改造中的先进分子，以极大的信赖选举了工农业生产模范、互助合作运动中的组织者和带头人以及其他方面的优秀人物为代表，其中许多人是共产党员和青年团员。各地所选出的代表中，妇女的名额平均在百分之十七以上。
    各族人民在基层选举中进一步提高了政治觉悟，充分认识到当家作主的重要意义，积极参加了选举活动，庄严地行使了选举权利，因而参加投票的选民达到了选民总数的百分之八十五以上，很多地区高达百分之九十以上，有不少地区甚至达到百分之百。这些比例数字，表明了人民群众的政治热情，也表明了我国选举制度的广泛民主性。
    人民群众政治积极性的提高，带来了生产积极性的高涨，基层选举有力地推动了生产建设和其他各项工作。北京市三十二个国营、地方国营、公私合营企业，在基层选举中，工人们掀起生产竞赛，提前一个多月完成了季度生产计划。山西省长治专区十个县三百五十三个乡，在基层选举运动中，共新建农业生产合作社三百四十九个，发展互助组一千一百多个。这不过是无数事实的个别例举。
    经过基层选举，人民群众把他们所不满意的分子从基层国家行政机关中清除出去了，增加了大批的由群众中涌现出来的优秀代表，基层干部在人民监督之下思想作风大大改善，建设社会主义的积极性更加提高，不少工作比较薄弱的乡村得到了改造或整顿，各种机构和制度也更加健全，因而基层国家行政机关的工作效率大大提高，人民更加信赖共产党和政府，群众和干部之间的关系更加融洽。基层国家行政机关在选举后的新生气象，将在今后国家各项建设工作中发生巨大的作用。
    基层选举的结果，使国家权力机关和国家行政机关得到了进一步的加强和进一步的民主化。因而一切基层干部对于人民群众在基层选举中高涨起来的政治积极性和生产积极性，必须善于掌握，利用这种有利条件，继续改进和作好基层国家行政机关的工作，特别是开好人民代表大会会议，巩固人民代表大会制度。我们作好各种工作的政治基础，是依靠广大人民群众，发扬民主，集中群众的智慧和力量。基层人民代表大会是基层的国家权力机关，能够最充分地表现人民的意志，也能够最好地团结和组织广大群众，提高生产，提高工作。基层选举之后，一般都已经召开了人民代表大会会议，获得了很好的成绩；但有的地区开得还不够好。这是应该加以改进的。没有开好的地区，应总结经验教训，吸取其他地区的先进经验，把基层人民代表大会会议开好。
    现在，中华人民共和国宪法草案公布了，并交由全国人民进行讨论。国家权力机关和国家行政机关的基层组织，必须动员和组织全体人民热烈参加这一讨论，搜集人民群众的意见，并通过宪法的宣传，提高人民群众的政治觉悟和生产的热情。
    为了开好基层人民代表大会会议，巩固人民代表大会制度，还必须经常帮助人民代表加强和人民群众的联系，使人民代表树立明确的向选民负责、受选民直接监督的观念。人民代表的主要职责，就在于经常联系选民，倾听群众的意见，帮助群众解决困难，把群众的意见及时反映给国家行政机关，对群众重要的意见和要求，作成提案，交给人民代表大会会议去讨论和解决。基层选举结束之后，有的地区已注意对人民代表的经常帮助，从各方面给人民代表以工作的便利，提高代表的威信，组织代表进行工作和学习。这些经验，都应该认真总结，并加以推广。
    国家权力机关和国家行政机关的基层组织及其日常活动，在国家生活中占有十分重要的地位。基层组织每天每时都和人民群众发生直接的联系；党的一切方针和政策，政府的一切法律和措施，都是通过基层组织来实现。因此，我们必须再三强调，在基层选举以后，各地必须继续加强对基层工作的领导，加强对基层干部的教育和帮助，使他们都能够清楚地认识到自己岗位的光荣和重要，积极作好各项工作，在基层选举获得伟大胜利的基础上，把基层国家权力机关和国家行政机关的工作，向前大大推进一步。
