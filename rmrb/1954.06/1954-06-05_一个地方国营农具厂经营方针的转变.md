    A Shift in the Business Philosophy of a Local State-Owned Farm Tool Factory
    Chen Fan
    The woodworking workshop of the Xiaogan Special District Farm Tool Factory in Hubei Province was originally the Xiaogan County Farm Tool Factory and was only merged into the Xiaogan Special District Farm Tool Factory in January of this year. The original Xiaogan County Farm Tool Factory, due to poor management, often had product backlogs and lost 90 million yuan in 1952. It also lost money in the first three quarters of 1953.
    The leadership of the original Xiaogan County Farm Tool Factory held a purely profit-seeking view and a parochial work style, believing that making appliances and furniture for government offices and schools was more profitable than making farm tools. Therefore, they manufactured large quantities of desks, chairs, benches, filing cabinets, horizontal bars, parallel bars, wooden horses, etc. Non-agricultural products accounted for more than 80 percent of the total value of production. Even when they made a few farm tools, they were shoddy and only for show. For example, the waterwheels sold by the factory were returned by farmers because of poor quality and specifications that did not meet the needs of the farmers. Farmers who had already signed contracts with the factory also demanded cancellation of the contracts. Farmers criticized the factory for not acting like it was serving the farmers, only making appliances and furniture, and not even being able to buy a good hoe handle.
    In the second half of last year, according to the spirit of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee's local industry conference, the factory examined the problems existing in production. In January of this year, the factory was merged into the Xiaogan Special District Farm Tool Factory and changed to a woodworking workshop. The workers discussed the general task of the state during the transition period, further clarified the policy that local industry must serve agricultural production, recognized the great significance of developing agricultural production to realize national industrialization, criticized past erroneous ideas, and corrected the business philosophy. The production of the workshop underwent a significant change. They sent people to the countryside to solicit farmers' opinions on the products and established contacts with cooperatives and mutual aid groups. After the people who went to the countryside returned to the factory, they conveyed the farmers' opinions and requests to the workers and held meetings to discuss and mobilize the workers to find ways to improve product quality and reduce costs. After the products were produced well, they were immediately delivered to the countryside, and they made four guarantees to the farmers: guaranteed selection, guaranteed exchange, guaranteed use, and guaranteed repair. At the same time, they also took back and repaired the farm tools of poor quality in the past and apologized to the farmers. After the change in business style, they were quickly welcomed by the farmers, and the sales of products also opened up. The proportion of farm tool products in the total value of production of the workshop increased from less than 20 percent of the total to more than 80 percent, and in February and March of this year, 100 percent of the production was farm tools.
    After studying, the socialist consciousness of the workers in the workshop also generally improved, and they clarified the role of the factory and individuals in national construction and improved their enthusiasm for production. Recently, workers Hu Junping, Peng Zaoting, Li Yuansheng, and others improved and created a total of six kinds of production tools. The tool they improved for scribing the mortise and tenon lines of the waterwheel is twice as efficient as before; the drilling tool could only drill 200 holes a day in the past, but after the improvement, it can drill more than 300 holes a day; it used to take 16 minutes to scribe a line on the waterwheel frame, but after creating the scribing tool, it only takes half a minute, increasing work efficiency by 31 times; the waterwheel ground beam scribing frame they created saves 19 steps in the scribing procedure, increasing work efficiency by 32 times, and the specifications are consistent; sawing waterwheel tenons used to take each person 300 pieces a day, but after creating the waterwheel tenon sawing tool, they can saw 600 pieces a day; the efficiency of the waterwheel drum head scribing tool they created has also increased eightfold. Due to the improvement and creation of these tools, labor efficiency has been greatly improved. Now, 161 workers can be saved by manufacturing 131 waterwheels, and the production task is completed two days ahead of schedule. In the past, it took nine workers to make one waterwheel, but now it only takes more than six workers.
    The workshop has also established systems for material allocation, material requisition, storage, and accounting in production management. Due to attention to saving raw materials, production costs have also been reduced.
    In the first quarter of this year, the workshop has supplied farmers with 164 waterwheels, 122 shoulder-pole loads of manure buckets and water buckets, and 764 large and small farm tools such as seedling clips, seedling horses, chopping rollers, plows, harrows, cultivators, and cover plates. In the second quarter, it plans to manufacture 2,622 various farm tools to support agricultural production.

    一个地方国营农具厂经营方针的转变
    陈帆
    湖北省孝感专区农具厂的木工车间原来是孝感县农具厂，今年一月才合并到孝感专区农具厂来的。原来的孝感县农具厂由于经营管理不善，产品经常积压，一九五二年亏本九千万元。一九五三年前三季度也亏了本。
    原来的孝感县农具厂领导上存在着单纯营利观点和本位主义的作风，认为做农具不如给机关、学校做器具、家具利润大。因此就大批制做桌、椅、板凳、公文柜、单杠、双杠、木马等，计算起来非农具产品的价值竟占生产总值的百分之八十以上。即使制造一点农具，也是粗制滥造，装点门面的。如该厂卖出去的水车，因为质量不好，规格不合农民需要，农民又给退回来了，已经和该厂订立合同的农民也纷纷要求退约。农民批评该厂不像为农民办事的样子，专做器具、家具，连一根好锄头柄都买不到。
    去年下半年，该厂根据中共湖北省委地方工业会议的精神，检查了生产中存在的问题，今年一月该厂合并到孝感专区农具厂改为木工车间，职工们讨论了国家在过渡时期的总任务，进一步明确了地方工业必须为农业生产服务的方针，认识到发展农业生产对实现国家工业化的重大意义，批判了过去的错误思想，端正了经营方针以后，该车间的生产就起了显著的变化。他们派人下乡征求农民对产品的意见，并与合作社、互助组建立了联系。下乡的人回厂后，把农民的意见和要求在工人中传达，并开会讨论，发动工人想办法提高产品质量，降低成本。产品生产好后，随即送货下乡，向农民提出四条保证：保挑，保换，保用，保修。同时对过去质量差的农具也收回修理，并向农民道歉。经营作风改变后，很快就受到了农民的欢迎，产品的销路也打开了。该车间农具产品在生产总值中的比重，由原来占总数不到百分之二十增加到百分之八十以上，今年二、三月份百分之百地生产农具了。
    该车间的职工们在学习后，社会主义觉悟也普遍提高，明确了工厂和个人在国家建设中的作用，提高了生产积极性。最近工人胡均平、彭藻庭、李元盛等共改进和创造了六种生产工具。他们改进的划水车锁子墨线的工具，效率比原来提高一倍；钻眼工具过去一天只能钻两百个眼，改进后一天能钻三百多个眼；划水车架子的墨线，以前要十六分钟划一根，创造了划线工具后只要半分钟就行了，工作效率提高三十一倍；他们创造的水车地梁划线架，使划线手续节省十九道，工作效率提高三十二倍，而且规格一致；锯水车锁子，过去每人每天只能锯三百个，创造了锯水车锁子工具后，一天就能锯六百个；他们创造的水车鼓头划线工具工作效率也提高八倍。由于这些工具的改进和创造，大大提高了劳动效率，现在制造一百三十一乘水车即可节省一百六十一个工，同时还按照预定时间提前两天完成了生产任务。过去做一乘水车要九个工，现在只要六个多工。
    该车间在生产管理上也建立了配料、领料、保管、会计等制度。由于注意节约原材料，生产成本也降低了。
    今年第一季度，该车间已供给农民水车一百六十四乘，粪桶、水桶一百二十二担，以及秧夹、秧马、宰滚、犁、耙、耖子、连盖等大小农具七百六十四件。第二季度并准备制造各种农具二千六百二十二件支援农业生产。
