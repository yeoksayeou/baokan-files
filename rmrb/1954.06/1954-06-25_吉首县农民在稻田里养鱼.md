    Farmers in Jishou County, Hunan Province, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region, are raising fish in rice paddies. Jishou County is a mountainous area with no ponds, and the Miao farmers originally had the custom of raising fish in rice paddies. However, during the Kuomintang rule, reactionary military police arbitrarily caught fish in the fields and incited disunity between Han and Miao farmers, which gradually reduced rice paddy fish farming. After liberation, the phenomena of arbitrary fish catching and disunity between Han and Miao people have disappeared, and rice paddy fish farming has gradually recovered. Farmers not only eat fresh fish, but also gradually increase their income. Xiang Jiufa, a farmer in Woyun Township, raised four "bowls" of fancy carp fry and two hundred carp in his rice paddies last year, and sold ninety catties of fish after the autumn harvest. At the same time, weeds were eaten by the fish, which saved more than twenty man-days of weeding labor. This year, more farmers in Jishou County are raising fish in rice paddies, and some Miao farmers in the fifth district have also released fish fry in mountain slope fields.

    吉首县农民在稻田里养鱼
    湖南省湘西苗族自治区吉首县农民利用稻田养鱼。吉首县是山区，没有池塘，苗族农民原来就有在稻田里养鱼的习惯。但在国民党统治时期，由于反动军警随便到田里捉鱼，并挑拨汉苗农民的团结，因之稻田养鱼逐渐减少。解放后，随便捉鱼和汉苗不团结的现象已不存在，稻田养鱼又逐渐恢复，农民不仅吃到鲜鱼，收入也逐渐增加。卧云乡农民向九发，去年在稻田里养了四碗花鱼秧、两百条鲤鱼，秋收后就卖了九十斤鱼。同时由于鱼吃去杂草，还节省二十多个薅草的人工。吉首县今年在稻田里养鱼的农民更多了，五区有些苗族农民在山坡坨田里也放了鱼秧。            （郭鼎诚）
