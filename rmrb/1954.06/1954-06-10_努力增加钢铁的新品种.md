    Strive to Increase New Varieties of Steel
    Xu Yan, Deputy Director of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau
    In order to realize national industrialization and develop various industries, it is necessary to produce a large amount of steel to supply and meet the needs of various industrial sectors. Meeting the needs of various departments for steel includes two aspects: one is meeting the quantity, and the other is meeting the types and shapes of steel. If steel plants only produce ordinary steel and simple round and square steel, it will cause stockpiles and fail to meet the needs of all parties. We know that manufacturing airplanes, automobiles, trains, and ships, manufacturing various precision automated machines and instruments, and modern national defense equipment all require high-quality steel and alloy steel with specific compositions and properties (such as acid resistance, heat resistance, and ultra-high mechanical properties). The required shapes of steel are even more complex. Round shapes range from a few hundredths of a millimeter thin to about one meter thick. Plates range from a few tenths of a millimeter thin to hundreds of millimeters thick. Tubes range from two millimeters thin to hundreds of millimeters thick. There are also various sizes of steel wire ropes, steel strips, etc. Existing steel plants can only produce a portion of these specially required high-quality steel and alloy steel, as well as various shapes of steel, and many extremely important steel types and shapes cannot be produced. To produce these complex steel products, special equipment, special smelting methods, special forging and rolling methods, special heat treatment methods, and special inspection methods are required. This requires adding equipment and technical personnel and workers who can master these technologies. Achieving this task also requires an arduous trial production process for new products. This is a very heavy but necessary task. In addition to the need to build new steel plants to complete certain new products, existing steel plants must strive to undertake this task. If the estimation of new product trial production tasks is insufficient, a negative attitude is adopted, or the implementation of the new product trial production plan is delayed, it will affect the development of other industries and the national defense industry, and it will affect the speed of national industrialization, which would be a serious political error!
    In the past few years, various steel plants have trial-produced some new products, and large-scale trial production work began in 1953. In 1953, electric furnace steel plants planned to trial-produce 33 new steel types, of which 26 were trial-produced, and 19 were successfully trial-produced, accounting for 57% of the original plan, thereby partially solving the needs of construction. Judging from the completion of the 1953 trial production plan, the results were not good. The reasons, in addition to the objective difficulties that cannot be overcome at present, are that there are the following serious shortcomings in the new product trial production work: First, some leading cadres and engineers do not have a sufficient understanding of the political and economic significance of new product trial production. They emphasize that the equipment is old and insufficient, and new products cannot be manufactured. They are afraid that new product trial production will disrupt and disrupt production plans and affect the completion of production tasks. Therefore, they treat new product trial production work with a conservative attitude. At ordering meetings, they only plan for themselves, avoid difficulties, and only accept things that are easy to manufacture, such as the simplest square steel, round steel, and small forgings that are easy to forge. They do not consider how to overcome difficulties, produce difficult-to-manufacture products and new products to meet and solve the needs of other departments. They do not lead and inspire cadres on how to learn advanced Soviet technology with the spirit of technological innovation, transform and make full use of old equipment, and actively engage in new product trial production work. Second, the manufacture of many new products must be based on having certain equipment. Without this equipment, it will be impossible to manufacture at all, or the quality cannot be guaranteed if manufacturing is reluctantly carried out, and it should not be formally put into production. However, this point has not been recognized and valued by the ordering departments and the leading cadres of some steel plants. The ordering departments demand that the manufacturers reluctantly produce because of urgent needs, and the leading comrades of the steel plants only agree to trial production based on needs, resulting in production that cannot be used or is not dared to be used, causing losses to the country. Third, the new product trial production plan is still in the hands of the factory director, the head of the production technology section, the workshop director, and the engineer. It has not been communicated and discussed in detail in the Party Committee and the trade union, let alone meeting with the broad masses like the production plan. The general cadres and workers do not know the new product trial production tasks and contents of the factory, and they do not know the significant relationship between new product trial production and national industrialization. Of course, there is no question of establishing the concept that the trial production task must be completed. Fourth, each factory only has new product trial production tasks, but has not formulated monthly and quarterly trial production plans and a dedicated responsibility system. As a result, trial production time is squeezed out when the production tasks are busy. No one is responsible for preparing the operation methods and raw materials. Trial production cannot be carried out at the scheduled time, or trial production is carried out but no one organizes the data and summarizes it, and no trial production summary is made for a long time. Fifth, most new products are national technical secrets, but the confidentiality organization and system are not sound, and confidential documents lack dedicated personnel for receiving, dispatching, and keeping, and loss has occurred.
    At present, the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry has issued the 1954 new product trial production plan, which is formulated according to the urgent needs of national industrial construction and national defense construction. The production of these steels is related to the development of the national defense industry and important machinery industry, and the task is very important. To produce these steels, the difficulties are quite large. If the plan is not thorough and the preparation is not enough, there is a risk of not being able to complete it. Therefore, the leading comrades and all employees of each steel plant must pay close attention to it and should carry out the following work in a timely manner:
    First, the new product trial production tasks issued by the Iron and Steel Bureau should be conveyed to the Party Committee, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League. First, the leaders of the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League should study and discuss it, and then convey the new product trial production tasks to the broad masses of employees. Explain how significant the new product trial production task is to national industrialization, explain that the trial production plan, like the production plan, is a task that the country requires to be completed. Explain that existing steel plants cannot be satisfied with existing products and the current backward technical level, and must strive to learn advanced Soviet technology, improve their technical level, and list actively researching and manufacturing new products to supply the country's needs as one of the main contents of technical innovation. Also, they should cultivate technical personnel and workers who can master advanced technologies for new factories, and call on the broad masses of employees to carry forward creativity and the spirit of perseverance, and strive to manufacture more new products for the country. Employees who successfully trial-produce major new products should be given spiritual and material rewards.
    Second, the capacity of electric furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, rolling mills, steam hammers, finishing equipment, heat treatment equipment, and testing equipment must be carefully calculated, the new product trial production tasks must be scheduled, and a new product trial production operation plan must be compiled. After calculating the materials and funds, the raw material supply and financial plans must be compiled. After finding out the equipment imbalances and other weak links, a technical organization measure plan must be formulated to solve the weak links. In accordance with these plans, overcome the confusion that may occur, carry out work in an orderly manner, and finally make a summary of each new product trial production in accordance with the new product trial production regulations.
    Third, a responsibility system at all levels and a personal responsibility system must be established. Each factory is required to designate several people to form a group to be responsible for leading and studying new product trial production work. The Production Technology Section, the Laboratory, and the Workshop should each designate a leader to be responsible for this work. Each work section should also designate a dedicated person, and should designate which furnace is responsible for the new product smelting work. If necessary, re-equip the furnace's operators. The raw material supply should also designate a dedicated person to be responsible for.
    Finally, it is necessary to strengthen confidentiality work. Relevant confidential documents should be designated to dedicated personnel for safekeeping, and the personnel participating in the trial production of confidential new products must be examined by the relevant departments.

    努力增加钢铁的新品种
    钢铁工业管理局副局长　许言
    为了实现国家工业化，发展各种工业，必须生产大量的钢铁，供应和满足各工业部门的需要。满足各部门对钢铁的需要，包括两方面，一方面是数量上的满足，一方面是钢种型材的满足。如果钢铁厂仅仅生产普通钢和简单的圆方钢材，那就会造成积压，又不能满足各方面的需要。我们知道，制造飞机、汽车、火车和轮船，制造各种精密的自动化的机器和仪器，现代化国防设备都需要特定成分和特定性能的优质钢和合金钢（如耐酸、耐热、特高机械性能等），所需要钢材的形状更是复杂，圆形的要求从零点零几粍细到一公尺左右那样粗，板材要求从零点几粍薄到数百粍左右厚，管材要求从二粍细到数百粍粗，还有各种尺寸的钢丝绳，钢带等。这些有特殊要求的优质钢和合金钢以及各种形状的钢材，现有钢铁厂只能生产一部分，很多极重要的钢种和型材还不能生产。要生产这些复杂的钢铁产品，需要有特殊的设备，特殊的冶炼方法，特殊的锻轧方法，特殊的热处理方法，特殊的检验方法。这就需要增添设备，需要能掌握这些技术的技术人员和工人。实现这项任务还需要一个艰巨的新产品的试制过程。这是一个十分繁重但又必须完成的任务，某些新产品除必须新建钢铁厂完成外，现有钢铁厂必须努力担负起这项任务来。如果对新产品试制任务估计不足，采取消极态度，或拖延新产品试制计划的实现，必将影响其他工业及国防工业的发展，必将影响国家工业化的速度，那就会犯严重的政治错误！
    几年来，各钢铁厂都试制了一部分新产品，并且从一九五三年开始了大规模的试制工作。一九五三年，电炉钢厂计划试制三十三种新钢种，其中有二十六种进行了试制，十九种试制成功，占原计划的百分之五十七，因之部分地解决了建设上的需要。从一九五三年试制计划完成情况来看，成绩是不好的。其原因除客观上确有许多目前尚不能克服的困难外，就是在新产品试制工作上存在着下列几个严重的缺点：第一、某些领导干部和工程师对新产品试制的政治意义和经济意义认识不足，强调设备老旧和不足，不能进行新产品制造，害怕新产品试制破坏和打乱生产计划，影响生产任务的完成，因之以保守主义的态度对待新产品试制工作。他们在订货会议上，光为自己打算，避难就易，只接受容易制造的东西，如最简单的方钢圆钢以及易锻的小型锻材，不去考虑如何克服困难，生产难制造的产品和新产品，以满足和解决其他部门的需要。他们不去领导和启发干部如何以技术革新的精神，学习苏联先进技术，改造和充分利用旧设备，积极从事新产品试制工作。第二、许多新产品的制造必须以具有一定的设备为前提，缺乏这些设备将根本不可能进行制造，或勉强进行制造而不能保证质量，不应正式投入生产。但这一点尚未被订货部门和某些钢铁厂的领导干部所认识和重视。订货部门因需要迫切，要求制造厂勉强生产，而钢铁厂的领导同志也就只从需要出发答应试制，结果是生产了不能用或不敢用，给国家造成了损失。第三、新产品试制计划还停留在厂长、生产技术科长、车间主任及工程师手里，未在党委会和工会详细传达和讨论，更没有像生产计划似的和广大群众见面。一般干部和工人不知道本厂新产品试制任务和内容，不知道新产品试制与国家工业化的重大关系，当然更谈不到树立必须完成试制任务的观念。第四、各厂只有新产品试制任务，但未制订月、季的试制计划和专责制度，结果是生产任务忙就挤掉了试制时间，操作方法和原材料无专人准备，到预定时间不能试制，或试制但无人整理资料和总结，长时间作不出试制总结。第五、新产品多为国家的技术机密，但保密组织和制度不健全，机密文件缺乏专人收发和保管，已发生丢失现象。
    目前，重工业部钢铁工业管理局已颁发一九五四年新产品试制计划，这是根据国家工业建设和国防建设的迫切需要而拟定的，这些钢材的生产，关系着国防工业和重要机械工业的发展，任务十分重大。而要生产这些钢材，困难是相当大的，如果计划不周，准备不够，那就有完不成的危险。因之，要求各钢铁厂的领导同志和全体职工，必须十分重视并应及时进行以下工作：
    第一、应该将钢铁局颁发的新产品试制任务向党委、工会、青年团作传达，首先由党、行政、工会、青年团领导上研究讨论，然后向广大职工传达新产品试制任务。说明新产品试制任务与国家工业化关系如何重大，说明试制计划与生产计划一样，都是国家规定必须完成的任务。说明现有钢铁厂不能满足于现有的产品和现在的落后的技术水平，必须努力学习苏联先进的技术，提高自己的技术水平，把积极钻研制造新产品供应国家需要列为技术革新主要内容之一，并为新工厂培养能掌握先进技术的技术人员和工人，号召广大职工发扬创造性和不屈不挠的精神，为国家多制造新产品而奋斗。对重大新产品试制成功的职工应给予精神和物质的奖励。
    第二、必须精细的计算电炉、平炉、轧钢机、汽锤、精整设备、热处理设备、检验设备的能力，将新产品试制任务排开，编制新产品试制作业计划，计算材料和资金后，编制原材料供应和财务计划，找出设备不平衡和其他薄弱环节后，即拟定解决薄弱环节的技术组织措施计划。按照这些计划，克服可能发生的混乱现象，有次序地进行工作，最后按照新产品试制规程作出各项新产品试制总结来。
    第三、必须建立各级责任制和个人专责制。要求各厂指定几个人组成小组，专负领导研究新产品试制工作，生产技术科、化验室和车间均应指定一领导人负责这项工作，各工段亦应指定专人，并应指定那个炉子担负新产品冶炼工作，必要时重新配备炉子的操作工人，原材料供应亦应指定专人负责。
    最后，要加强保密工作，有关机密文件应指定专人负责保管，参加机密性新产品之试制人员必须经过有关部门的审查。
