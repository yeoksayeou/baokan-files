Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 7th. Shaanxi Province has had a bumper harvest on over 23.5 million mu of winter wheat. According to preliminary estimates from the Provincial People's Government Statistics Bureau, the average yield per mu is 155.7 jin, exceeding last year by 3.16 percent. With a planting area expanded by over 590,000 mu compared to last year, the total output is expected to reach over 3.6 billion jin, an increase of 5.82 percent over last year. Chang'an, Wugong, Xingping, and Chenggu counties, which achieved large-scale high yields last year, have created new high-yield records this year. The 1.5 million mu of winter wheat in these four counties yielded an average of 230 to 290 jin per mu, an increase of 1.7 to 11.5 percent over last year. In Leizhai and Yangshan townships of Chang'an County, 8,000 mu of winter wheat yielded an average of over 400 jin per mu. State-owned farms and many agricultural producers' cooperatives have also excellently completed their winter wheat production increase plans. Farmers across the province are now filled with joy, carrying out intensive harvesting from south to north.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 8th. Over 33 million mu of wheat in Jiangsu Province has been harvested in large quantities, and it will all be completed in another week. According to the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the total wheat production in the province is estimated to be around 3.5 billion jin, an increase of over 20 percent compared to last year, and nearly 10 percent more than 1952, the year with the highest yield since liberation. This is the result of farmers across the province further developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement under the leadership of Party and government organs, and actively fighting against natural disasters. The drought north of the Yangtze River during the autumn wheat planting season, the frost north of the Huai River in April this year, and the rain and floods in low-lying areas and flash floods in hilly areas in the twenty days before the wheat harvest, generally had little impact on the wheat due to the vigorous resistance and rescue efforts of the farmers. During the intensive harvesting period, agricultural producers' cooperatives everywhere are harvesting and threshing carefully, striving to get every grain of wheat into the granary, with an estimated increase of one jin per mu.

    陕西江苏两省五千多万亩冬小麦丰收
    【新华社西安七日电】陕西省两千三百五十多万亩冬小麦丰收。据省人民政府统计局初步估计，全省平均每亩可收一百五十五点七斤，超过去年百分之三点一六，加以种植面积比去年扩大五十九万多亩，总产量可达到三十六亿多斤，比去年增加百分之五点八二。去年获得大面积丰产的长安、武功、兴平、城固等四个县，今年又创造了新的丰产纪录。这四个县今年共一百五十多万亩冬小麦，平均每亩可收二百三十斤到二百九十斤，比去年增产百分之一点七到百分之十一点五。长安县雷寨、杨善两乡八千亩冬小麦，平均每亩可收四百斤以上。各地国营农场和许多农业生产合作社也都出色地完成了冬小麦增产计划。现在全省农民正满怀喜悦，由南而北地展开紧张收割。
    【新华社南京八日电】江苏省三千三百多万亩小麦已大批收割，再过一个星期就可以全部收完。据江苏省人民政府农林厅估计，全省小麦总产量约三十五亿斤左右，比去年增产两成以上，比解放后产量最高的一九五二年还增产近一成。这是各地农民在党政机关领导下，进一步发展互助合作运动，积极和自然灾害作斗争的成果。去秋种麦期间长江以北地区的干旱，今年四月淮河以北地区的霜冻，以及麦收以前二十多天低洼地区的雨涝和丘陵地区的山洪暴发，经过农民大力抗御和抢救，一般对麦子影响不大。在紧张的收割期间，各地农业生产合作社都细收细打，争取小麦颗粒进仓，估计每亩可多收一斤。
