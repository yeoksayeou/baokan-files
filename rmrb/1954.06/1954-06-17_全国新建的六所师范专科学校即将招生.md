Six Newly Established Teachers' Colleges Across the Country to Begin Enrollment

In accordance with the principle of "vigorously developing higher normal education in a planned and prepared manner, based on consolidating and strengthening existing higher normal education, and according to needs and possibilities," as stipulated in the State Council's "Instructions on Improving and Developing Higher Normal Education," the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government recently approved the establishment of teachers' colleges by the Northwest, East China, Central South, and Southwest Education Bureaus in Xi'an, Shanghai, Wuhan, Kaifeng, Chongqing, and Nanchong, respectively. The Central Ministry of Education has also tentatively determined the names and sizes of the new schools in various locations. The school established in Xi'an is named Shaanxi Teachers' College, which will offer four departments this year: Political Education, Chinese Language and Literature, Mathematics, and Physics, and will enroll approximately 300 new students. The new school in Shanghai is named Shanghai Teachers' College, offering eight departments: Political Education, Chinese Language and Literature, History, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Geography, and will enroll approximately 840 students. The new school in Wuhan is named Hubei Teachers' College, offering eight departments: Chinese Language and Literature, History, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, and Physical Education, and will enroll approximately 500 new students. The new school in Kaifeng is named Henan Teachers' College, offering five departments: Chinese Language and Literature, History, Mathematics, Chemistry, and Geography, and will enroll approximately 260 students. The two new schools established in Chongqing and Nanchong, Sichuan Province, are named Chongqing Teachers' College and Sichuan Teachers' College, respectively. Both schools will offer three departments: Chinese Language and Literature, Mathematics, and Physics, and will each enroll approximately 200 students. In accordance with the principle of central unified leadership and direct local management, the education administrative departments in the localities where the schools are located are currently actively preparing to build school buildings, allocate teachers, and prepare for enrollment-related matters, and are scheduled to begin classes in the new academic year of 1954. The scale of these schools will gradually expand with the development of education, and it is estimated that the number of students enrolled will increase from more than 2,300 in 1954 to more than 6,500 in 1957.
