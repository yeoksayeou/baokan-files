    All-China Federation of Trade Unions and Writers Association Jointly Hold Symposium to Discuss How Literary and Artistic Creation Should Depict National Industrial Construction
    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Chinese Writers Association jointly held a symposium on the 3rd with writers and artists in Beijing to discuss how literary and artistic creation should depict national industrial construction and the experience of literary and artistic workers going to factories to experience life.
    Those attending the symposium included Zhou Yang, Ding Ling, and Lao She, vice chairmen of the Chinese Writers Association, and writers and artists in Beijing such as Zhou Libo, Liu Baiyu, Bai Lang, Tian Jian, Ai Wu, Li Ji, Sha Ting, Ruan Zhangjing, Lin Mohan, Chen Huangmei, Cao Yu, Zhang Tianyi, Zhao Shuli, Yan Wenjing, Xie Bingxin, Cai Chusheng, Shi Dongshan, Sun Wei Shi, Zhao Feng, Zhou Weizhi, Wu Zuoren, Gu Yuan, and Hua Junwu, more than ninety people in total.
    Attending the symposium from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions were Vice Chairman Liu Ningyi, Presidium members Xi Zhanyuan, Li Zaiwen, Yang Zhihua, and heads of various departments and offices.
    Also invited to attend the meeting were Li Fuchun, Vice Chairman of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government, and responsible persons from the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry, Ministry of First Machine Building, Ministry of Fuel Industry, Ministry of Textile Industry, and other departments.
    The symposium was presided over by Liu Ningyi. He said: In the great construction era of national socialist industrialization, there are many glorious heroic deeds among our male and female workers. The people of the whole country hope that writers can write about these deeds and the problems existing in construction work to help improve the work. The trade union warmly welcomes the cooperation of the literary and art circles.
    At the symposium, literary and artistic workers such as Ai Wu and Li Ji spoke about their experiences of going to factories to experience life, the problems existing in the experience of life, and the reflections of the working masses on their works. They unanimously believed that literary and artistic workers must actually participate in the work and struggle of the factory when they go to the factory to experience life; they also put forward some requirements for going to the factory to experience life and hoped to get help from the trade union and industrial leaders.
    Then, Li Fuchun spoke at the meeting. Regarding the question of what current literary and artistic creation should write, he hoped that writers would write about socialist industrialization, especially the first five-year plan, and mainly write about how the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party enabled the working class and the working people to improve their ideological, organizational, and labor levels to a socialist level. During the transition period, the Party and the state require every worker to overcome individualistic consciousness, departmentalism, and local viewpoints, and establish a collectiveist ideological style. Literary and artistic creation should criticize and oppose all backward and conservative things, everything that runs counter to socialism from all aspects. Praising advanced things, while also criticizing backward things, only in this way can literary and artistic creation have ideological and combative qualities. After analyzing the various problems existing in my country's industrial construction and workers' thinking, he said: These problems all need literary and artistic creation to give realistic descriptions and profound criticisms.
    Regarding the question of how to write, Li Fuchun hoped that literary and artistic workers should write about what they have come into contact with and researched, and don't always think about writing about all the problems comprehensively; at the same time, they should create more works regardless of form or length to meet the needs of the people; when portraying advanced figures, they must correctly describe according to socialist principles that he grew up and was trained in the collective, and is the result of the Party and the masses educating him, and should not portray him as a natural hero in isolation and prominently.
    Regarding writers going to factories to experience life, Li Fuchun believed that they should participate in actual work. He said: The attitude of an observer cannot go deep into life, but will instead be a burden on the factory. Writers should also be purposeful and step-by-step when they go to the factory to experience life, and cannot want to understand everything comprehensively as soon as they arrive at the factory.
    Li Fuchun finally said: Literary works should not be restricted by real people and real events when creating characters, and writers should not worry too much. What writers should consider is mainly the ideological and educational effect of the works. He said: To make the works have ideological and combative qualities, the writer must first have combative qualities.
    Zhang Xiuzhu, Minister of Propaganda of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, also spoke at the symposium. He described the improvement of the cultural level of workers across the country and the development of workers' spare-time literary and artistic activities since liberation; pointed out that literary and artistic works are powerful weapons for carrying out communist education for workers, and required writers to create more works for workers to read and perform, and provide guidance to workers' spare-time literary and artistic creation based on the workers' existing level.

    全国总工会和作家协会联合召开座谈会
    讨论文艺创作如何表现国家工业建设问题
    中华全国总工会、中国作家协会三日联合召开在京作家及文艺工作者座谈会，座谈文艺创作如何表现国家工业建设和文艺工作者到工厂体验生活等问题。
    参加座谈会的有中国作家协会副主席周扬、丁玲、老舍，和在京的作家及文艺工作者周立波、刘白羽、白朗、田间、艾芜、李季、沙汀、阮章竞、林默涵、陈荒煤、曹禺、张天翼、赵树理、严文井、谢冰心、蔡楚生、史东山、孙维世、赵沨、周巍峙、吴作人、古元、华君武等九十多人。
    中华全国总工会参加座谈会的有副主席刘宁一，主席团委员郗占元、栗再温、杨之华和各部、室负责人。
    应邀出席会议的还有中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会副主任李富春、中央人民政府重工业部、第一机械工业部、燃料工业部、纺织工业部等部门的负责人。
    座谈会由刘宁一主持。他说：在国家社会主义工业化的伟大建设时代，我们的男女工人中都有许多光荣的英雄事迹。全国人民都希望作家能把这些事迹写出来，把建设工作中存在的问题写出来，以帮助工作的改进。工会方面热烈欢迎文艺界的合作。
    在座谈会上，有文艺工作者艾芜、李季等分别就到工厂体验生活的经验、体验生活中存在的问题、工人群众对作品的反映等方面发了言。他们一致认为文艺工作者到工厂去体验生活，必须实际参加到工厂的工作和斗争中去；他们还提出了到工厂体验生活的一些要求，希望得到工会和工业领导部门的帮助。
    接着，李富春在会上讲话。对当前的文艺创作应该写什么的问题，他希望作家写社会主义工业化、特别是写第一个五年计划，并且主要的要写出中国共产党的领导如何使工人阶级和劳动人民在思想上、组织上、劳动上提高到社会主义水平。在过渡时期，党和国家要求每个工人都能克服个人主义意识、本位思想、局部观点，建立起集体主义的思想作风。文艺创作应该从各方面来批判和反对一切落后、保守的东西，一切与社会主义背道而驰的东西。赞扬先进事物，同时也要批判落后事物，只有如此，文艺创作才有思想性、斗争性。他分析了我国工业建设和工人思想中所存在的各种问题后说：这些问题都需要文艺创作给以真实的描写和深刻的批判。
    关于如何写法的问题，李富春希望文艺工作者接触到什么、研究到什么就写什么，不要动不动就想全面地写所有的问题；同时还要不拘形式，不拘长短地多多创作，以满足人民的需要；在表现先进人物时，必须正确地按照社会主义的原则描写他是从集体中成长锻炼出来的，是党和群众对他教育的结果，而不应孤立地突出地把他描写为天生的英雄。
    关于作家到工厂体验生活，李富春认为应该参加实际工作。他说：旁观者的态度是不能深入生活的，反而会是工厂的负担。作家到工厂体验生活还应该是有目的和有步骤的，不能一到工厂就想全面了解。
    李富春最后说：文艺作品创造人物不应受真人真事的限制，作家不要顾虑太多，作家应该考虑的主要是作品的思想性和教育效果。他说：要作品有思想性、斗争性，首先要作家有斗争性。
    在座谈会发言的还有中华全国总工会宣传部长张修竹。他叙述了解放以后全国工人文化水平提高和职工业余文艺活动发展的情况；指出文艺作品是对工人进行共产主义教育的有力的武器，要求作家多多创作一些供工人阅读和演出的作品，并根据工人现有的水平，对职工的业余文艺创作进行辅导。
