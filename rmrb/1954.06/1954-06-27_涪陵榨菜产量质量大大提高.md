    Fuling Preserved Mustard Tuber Production and Quality Greatly Improved
    Sichuan Province's Fuling County originally planned to produce more than 62,498,000 jin of preserved mustard tuber heads and 239,800 jars of finished preserved mustard tuber this year. Encouraged by the enthusiasm of farmers in supporting national industrial construction, they actively overcame spring droughts and insect pests, and strived to improve production. The county's production of preserved mustard tuber heads increased by 102.84 percent compared to the original plan, and by 148.04 percent compared to last year's output; the finished preserved mustard tuber increased by 162.08 percent compared to last year, with a total of 259,660 jars produced. The quality of the preserved mustard tuber has also greatly improved, with the amount of special grade preserved mustard tuber reaching more than 97 percent. In the process of manufacturing finished products, Professor Li Youlin of the Southwest Agricultural College guided the research on the content of moisture and salt, so this year's preserved mustard tuber tastes even more delicious. In addition, this year, according to the opinions of the Chinese People's Volunteers, etc., some small jar preserved mustard tuber, sugar preserved mustard tuber, and sweet and sour preserved mustard tuber that are easy to carry were also manufactured. Now, these preserved mustard tuber are being continuously transported to major cities and industrial and mining areas across the country. (Lin Pingshan)

    涪陵榨菜产量质量大大提高
    四川省涪陵县今年原计划生产榨菜头六千二百四十九万八千余斤，制榨菜二十三万九千八百坛。由于菜农在支持国家工业建设的热情鼓舞下，积极战胜春旱和虫害，努力提高生产，全县生产的榨菜头比原计划增加了百分之一百零二点八四，比去年的产量增加了百分之一百四十八点零四；榨菜的制成品比去年增加了百分之一百六十二点零八，共制出榨菜二十五万九千六百六十坛。榨菜的质量也大为提高，特级榨菜的数量达到百分之九十七以上。在制造成品的过程中，西南农学院李友霖教授指导研究了水分和盐分的含量，因此今年的榨菜味道更加可口。另外，今年还根据中国人民志愿军等的意见，制造了一些便于携带的小坛菜、糖榨菜和酸甜榨菜。现在，这些榨菜正源源运往全国各大城市和工矿区。　（林屏山）
