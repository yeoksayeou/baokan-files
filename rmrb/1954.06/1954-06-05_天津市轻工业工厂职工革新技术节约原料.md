Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 4th: Tianjin's local state-owned and joint state-private light industrial factories' workers, combining technological innovation, have proposed more than 30 rationalization proposals for saving raw materials, trying out raw material substitutes, and reducing costs. Twenty-four of these proposals have already been implemented.

    In the past, workers in the tailoring workshop of the Tianjin Knitting Factory only selected large pieces of material and cut them in whatever way was convenient, resulting in a lot of waste. Li Huayuan, a technician in the workshop, worked with the workers to improve the cutting specifications and tools, reducing raw material consumption by 20%. Previously, the factory needed ten pieces of sleeve material to cut one dozen flannel shirt sleeves, and only eight complete sleeves were obtained, with the remaining sixteen needing to be sewn together. Deng Yinfeng, a technician in the design department, improved the cutting method for flannel shirt sleeves. Now, only 9.6 pieces of sleeve material are needed to cut one dozen flannel shirt sleeves, yielding fourteen complete sleeves and only ten sewn sleeves. Deng Yinfeng also devised a diagonal shoulder nesting method, which saves 0.25 inches of material per flannel shirt cut. After the implementation of these two measures, it is estimated that the state can save more than 1.11 billion yuan this year. Since January this year, the dyeing and printing industry has been paying attention to using quantitative feeding and continuous dyeing and bleaching methods to reduce dye consumption. When the Tianjin Weaving and Dyeing Factory produced the new product "Gray Gabardine," it adopted continuous dyeing and bleaching methods, reducing the cost per piece of cloth by 1,632 yuan. After the First Printing and Dyeing Factory implemented quantitative feeding, the printed calico had consistent color, bright luster, and the dye cost per piece of cloth was reduced by more than 4,000 yuan compared to the past. Tobacco, match, and other factories have adopted several rational raw material usage methods, which have also significantly reduced costs.

    This year, factory workers have successfully researched and put into production sixteen types of raw material substitutes. The products produced using these substitute raw materials are of excellent quality. For example, dyeing and printing factories use cheaper sodium sulfide instead of the more expensive rapid powder as a mordant; they use abundant brominated indigo instead of the scarce Varamine Blue Salt to dye student blue, etc., which can save the country more than 2 billion yuan annually. The color, tensile strength, and fastness of colored cloth and calico also meet the standards. Workers in the printing workshop of the First Printing and Dyeing Factory successfully researched the use of canvas instead of rubber cloth on printing machines, saving more than 300 million yuan worth of rubber cloth annually. After using canvas instead of rubber cloth, the number of misprints, rejects, and downtime was also reduced. Han Yushan, an old worker at the Tianjin People's Paper Mill No. 1, and a technician researched the use of reed pulp instead of wood pulp to make snow-white paper. The paper's tensile strength, water resistance, color, and gloss are the same as before, and the cost per ream of paper can be reduced by more than 6,000 yuan.

    天津市轻工业工厂职工革新技术节约原料
    【新华社天津四日电】天津市地方国营、公私合营轻工业工厂职工结合技术革新，提出三十多件节约原料、试用原料代用品、降低成本的合理化建议，其中已经实现的有二十四件。
    天津针织厂裁缝车间工人过去用料光拣大块的用，怎么顺手就怎么裁，剩下的废料很多。车间技术员李华元和工人们共同研究，改进了裁剪规格和工具，使原料消耗量降低百分之二十。这个厂原来裁剪一打绒衣的衣袖要用十片袖料，而且只有八只整袖，其余的十六只都需要拼缝，设计科技术员邓银峰改进了绒衣袖的裁剪法，现在裁剪一打绒衣袖只要九点六片袖料，裁出的袖子有十四只整袖，只有十只拼缝袖。邓银峰还想出了斜肩套裁法，每裁一件绒衣可以节约用料零点二五吋。这两项措施实行后，据初步计算，今年就能为国家节约十一亿一千多万元。印染工业从今年一月份起就注意采用定量下料和续染、续漂等办法，减少染料的消耗。天津织染厂在生产新产品灰华达呢时，采用了续染、续漂的方法、每匹布的成本降低一千六百三十二元。第一印染厂实行定量下料后，印出的花布色头一致，光泽鲜艳，每匹布的染料成本比过去降低四千多元。烟草、火柴等工厂采取了几项合理使用原材料的办法，也使成本降低不少。
    今年各厂职工已经研究成功并投入生产的原料代用品有十六种。用这些代用原料生产出来的产品，质量很好。如印染工厂用价格较低的硫化碱代替价格较贵的快粉作促染剂；用货源充足的溴化靛青代替货源较缺少的凡拉明蓝盐染学生蓝等，全年可为国家节约二十多亿元。色布和花布的色泽、拉力和坚牢度也都合乎标准。第一印染厂印花车间工人们研究成功用帆布代替印花机上的胶布，全年节约的胶布值三亿多元。用帆布代替胶布后，还减少了错花、残品和停台次数。天津人民造纸一厂老工人韩玉山和技术员研究出用苇浆代替木浆造雪连纸，纸张的拉力、抗水度、颜色和光泽与原来的一样，每令纸的成本可降低六千多元。
