Continue to Conduct Propaganda and Education on the Worker-Peasant Alliance Among Workers
All-China Federation of Trade Unions Propaganda Department

Around the Spring Festival this year, concentrated propaganda and education on the worker-peasant alliance was conducted among workers throughout the country. This propaganda was mainly carried out through organizing worker delegations to visit farmers, inviting farmers to visit factories, and holding various forums and get-togethers. According to statistics from reports of six municipalities directly under the Central Government, seven provincial-level cities, four provinces, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, these regions organized a total of 436 worker delegations during the Spring Festival, with 38,549 workers participating, including labor models, advanced producers, engineers, technicians, cadres, veteran workers, youth workers, and women representatives from major production units. At the same time, farmer visiting groups were also organized to visit factories, with 11,722 farmers participating. Preliminary statistics show that a total of 1,445,100 people (times) participated in mutual visits, forums, and get-togethers between workers and peasants in these regions around the Spring Festival. Therefore, the worker-peasant alliance propaganda conducted during the Spring Festival was lively in form and large in scale.

This propaganda was carried out on the basis of vigorously publicizing the Party's general line during the transition period to workers and peasants, and therefore achieved good results. This is of great significance for further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

What are the gains from this worker-peasant alliance propaganda?

First, the broad masses of workers realized that the relationship between workers and peasants is a close, brotherly relationship, that the interests of workers and peasants are consistent, and that a solid alliance can and must be formed. When workers visited rural areas, they heard翻身 (liberated) peasants narrate the situation of cruel exploitation and oppression by the landlord class before liberation, and realized that workers and peasants were both exploited and oppressed classes under the rule of the reactionary government. The peasants said, "Today our lives have improved because the Communist Party led us to distribute land and led us to take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. We hope that workers will produce more new agricultural tools and pesticides to help us liberate our shoulders and hands, overcome disasters, and produce more grain." The workers felt, "Only when peasants supply grain and industrial raw materials can workers be guaranteed food and raw materials for production," "If peasants produce more grain to support national construction, we must work hard to build our country's industrialization and produce more tractors for farmers to jointly build the country." This enabled workers to correctly understand the role of agricultural production and to understand that only with the solid alliance of workers and peasants and the close integration of industry and agriculture can our country be built into a great socialist country. Therefore, many workers reviewed their erroneous ideas such as "If it weren't for the peasants holding us back, we would have reached socialism long ago."

Second, during the visits to rural areas, workers further recognized the responsibility of the working class to help peasants achieve socialist transformation. When the workers saw the new face of the countryside and the hardworking and simple peasant brothers, they deeply felt that they must actively create greater achievements in industrial construction to help farmers develop agricultural production, and realized that without industrial support for agriculture, the expansion of agricultural production and the improvement of farmers' working conditions would be difficult. Therefore, workers in heavy industry departments proposed, "Only by producing more steel to manufacture machines can farmers' land be completely turned over." Workers in factories producing agricultural tools and pesticides proposed, "We must produce more new agricultural tools and a large number of pesticides to help farmers cooperate and help each other." Employees in light industry departments said, "By doing a good job in production and accumulating more funds for the country, we can open more factories and manufacture tractors to support farmers," "Produce more daily necessities to meet the needs of farmers." In short, after visiting the countryside, the workers felt that they had a responsibility to help farmers take the socialist road in all aspects. Many workers reviewed their erroneous attitudes of "it's none of my business" towards agricultural production, and even putting on airs and acting like overlords towards farmers.

Third, the workers saw the benefits of agricultural mutual assistance and cooperation, further recognized the country's bright socialist future, and established the idea of taking the factory as their home. During the visits, no matter in which village, the organized farmers used their own experiences to tell the workers about the benefits of cooperation, enabling the workers to concretely understand that the farmers are gradually transitioning to a socialist society through the cooperative road. Some workers originally thought that "working in a factory is not as good as farming," "of all the seventy-two trades, farming is the strongest," and even had erroneous ideas and behaviors such as buying land, hoarding grain, and not wanting their families to participate in mutual assistance and cooperation. However, after this education, some reviewed their petty producer thinking and deposited their surplus money in the bank or bought government bonds; others wrote letters home, mobilizing their families to participate in mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives, mobilizing them to respond to the government's call to sell surplus grain to the state, and they themselves concentrated on working, actively producing, and supporting the socialist transformation of agriculture.

These gains prove the importance of conducting propaganda and education on the worker-peasant alliance among workers. However, it must be recognized that educating the working masses on the worker-peasant alliance is a long-term task and does not mean that it is no longer needed after it has been carried out once. At present, many factories and mines believe that the education on the worker-peasant alliance has ended, so they have stopped this work, which is not right. Of course, this does not mean that we should conduct propaganda as intensively as we did around the Spring Festival, but rather put it into the education plan for the general line for workers and conduct regular propaganda. Based on the situation and experience of carrying out this work around the Spring Festival, the following points are worth paying attention to in future work:

First, elevate the perceptual knowledge gained by workers during visits, get-togethers and other activities during the Spring Festival to the level of rational knowledge. The visits, get-togethers and other activities organized this time were relatively short, and the workers' understanding of the worker-peasant alliance generally still remains at the point of mutual dependence between workers and peasants in life, such as thinking that "without farmers growing grain, workers would have no food to eat, and without workers weaving cloth, farmers would have no clothes to wear," but their understanding of the great political and economic significance of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance is insufficient. Therefore, in the education to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance in the future, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the education of the workers on the Party's general line during the transition period to the state, and it is also necessary to systematically explain to the workers the Party's policies on peasants and agricultural production, as well as the principle that workers and peasants, industry and agriculture, and cities and villages must cooperate closely and support each other. To this end, it is necessary to educate workers so that they understand that peasants are the working class's most reliable allies, and the worker-peasant alliance is the basic force for building socialism and a guarantee of victory on all fronts. Only when workers and peasants, industry and agriculture, and cities and villages are closely integrated and support each other can our country be built into a great socialist country. It should be pointed out to the workers that in order to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, the most important responsibility of the working class is to give full play to their labor enthusiasm and creativity, ensure the comprehensive completion and strive to overfulfill the national plan, and support agriculture by developing industrial production, so as to improve and enhance agricultural production.

Second, educate workers to correctly understand the leading position of the working class and its specific responsibilities. This point has not been sufficiently educated to the workers in the past, so in this worker-peasant get-together, it was found that some workers had a lot of muddled ideas. For example, some workers visited agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and after seeing the progressive side of the farmers, they thought that they had never led the farmers, and that the farmers were more progressive than the working class, saying that the farmers were the "roots" and the workers were the "flowers," and even some cadres said: "I am not convinced that workers are leading." On the other hand, some employees, due to being universally praised by the farmers during this visit, increased their complacency. Therefore, it is necessary to make the working masses understand that the leadership of the working class is realized through the Communist Party, through the Communist Party's organization to instill socialist ideology into the peasants in order to guide the peasants to complete the socialist transformation; and the specific responsibility of the working masses is to develop industrial production, realize socialist industrialization, and prepare technical conditions for agricultural collectivization and modernization, and use the working class's collectivist thinking and creative labor to influence and drive the peasants to take the road of socialist collectivization.

Third, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance should not only be reflected in the policies of the Party and the government, but also in the daily lives of the workers and peasants. This is an important experience that was proved by the worker-peasant alliance education work carried out during the Spring Festival this year. Therefore, workers should be mobilized to establish regular contacts with farmers near factories and mines, so as to care for each other in production and life through daily contact, help each other solve specific difficulties that can be solved, and at the same time carry out socialist propaganda to farmers at any time through various political activities, raise farmers' awareness, and help farmers gradually embark on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. At the same time, it is also necessary to make workers understand the significance of agricultural production cooperatives and agricultural collectivization, so as to overcome the petty producer thinking of some workers.

The worker-peasant alliance is the foundation of our country's people's democratic dictatorship and the basic force for building a socialist society. Therefore, continuing to educate the working masses on the worker-peasant alliance in order to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance is an important task that must be carried out regularly over a long period of time in the future.

    继续向职工群众进行工农联盟的宣传教育
    中华全国总工会宣传部
    今年春节前后，全国各地都向职工进行了一次集中的工农联盟的宣传教育。这一次宣传多是以组织工人代表团访问农民、邀请农民参观工厂以及举行各种座谈会和联欢会等形式进行的。根据六个中央直辖市、七个省辖市、四个省及内蒙古自治区的报告统计，这些地区在春节期间共组织工人代表团四三六个，参加的职工有三八、五四九人，其中包括了各主要生产单位的劳动模范、先进生产者、工程技术人员、干部、老年工人、青年工人和妇女代表等。与此同时也组织了农民访问团到工厂参观，参加的农民达一一、七二二人。据初步统计，这些地区在春节前后参加工农互相访问、座谈和联欢的群众共达一、四四五、一○○人（次）。所以这次在春节期间进行的工农联盟宣传在形式上是活泼的，在规模上是巨大的。
    这次宣传是在大张旗鼓地向工农群众宣传党在国家过渡时期的总路线的基础上进行的，因此，收到了良好的效果。这对于进一步巩固工农联盟是有很大意义的。
    这次进行的工农联盟宣传有哪些收获呢？
    第一、广大职工群众认识了工人与农民的关系是血肉相连的兄弟关系，工农的利益是一致的，是可以而且也必须结成巩固联盟的。职工在访问农村时，听到翻身农民叙述解放前受地主阶级残酷剥削与压迫的情况，认识了工人与农民在反动政府统治时，都是被剥削被压迫的阶级。农民说：“今天我们的生活得到改善，是由于共产党领导我们分得了土地和领导我们走了互助合作的道路。希望工人多生产新式农具、农药，帮助我们解放肩膀和手脚，战胜灾害，多打粮食。”工人感到：“只有农民供给粮食及工业原料，才能保证工人有粮食吃，有生产的原料”，“农民多打粮食支援国家建设，我们必须努力建设，使我国工业化，多给农民造些拖拉机，共同建设国家”。这样就使工人正确地认识了农业生产的作用，明了只有工人和农民的巩固联盟，工业和农业的密切结合，才能把我国建成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。因此，不少工人检讨了“要不是农民拉后腿，我们早就到社会主义了”等错误想法。
    第二、在访问农村当中，工人进一步认识了工人阶级帮助农民实现社会主义改造的责任。当工人亲眼看到了农村的新面貌，看到艰苦朴素、辛勤劳动的农民兄弟时，深深感到必须积极地在工业建设上创造出更大的成绩来帮助农民发展农业生产，认识到没有工业对农业的支援，农业的扩大生产和农民劳动条件的改善都是有困难的。因此，重工业部门的工人提出：“只有多出钢铁制造机器，农民的土地才能彻底翻身”。生产农具、农药工厂的工人提出：“一定要多生产新式农具和大批的农药，帮助农民合作互助”。轻工业部门的职工则表示：“搞好生产，多给国家积累资金，才能多开工厂，制造拖拉机支援农民”，“多生产日用品，供给农民需要”。总之，工人在访问农村以后，都感觉自己有责任从各个方面帮助农民走社会主义的道路。不少职工检讨了自己对农业生产采取“事不关己，高高挂起”，甚至向农民摆架子、逞威风的错误态度。
    第三、工人看到农业互助合作的好处，进一步认识了国家的社会主义光明前途，树立了以工厂为家的思想。在访问中，无论在那个村子，组织起来的农民，都以亲身经历向工人述说了合作化的好处，使工人具体地认识了农民正在通过合作社的道路，逐步过渡到社会主义社会。有些工人原来认为
  “干工不如务农”、“天下七十二行，庄稼为强”，甚至有买地、囤粮、不愿意自己的家属参加互助合作等错误的思想和行为，可是经过这次教育之后，有的检讨了自己的小生产者思想，并且把余钱存入银行或买了公债；也有的写信回家，动员自己的家属参加互助组或农业生产合作社，动员他们响应政府号召，把余粮卖给国家，而自己也专心做工，积极生产，支援农业的社会主义改造。
    这些收获证明了向职工群众进行工农联盟的宣传教育的重要意义。但是，必须认识，向职工群众进行工农联盟的教育是长期的，并不是进行一次以后就不再需要进行了。目前有不少厂矿认为工农联盟的教育已经结束了，就停止了这一工作，这是不对的。当然，这也不是说目前还要像春节前后那样集中地进行宣传，而是要把它放在向职工进行总路线的教育计划中，作经常的宣传。根据春节前后进行这一工作的情况和经验，下列几点是值得在今后工作中注意的：
    第一、把职工在春节期间进行访问、联欢等活动中所吸取的感性认识提到理性认识的高度。这次所组织的访问、联欢等活动，时间较短，职工对于工农联盟的认识，一般还停留在工人和农民在生活上的互相依赖这一点上，如认为“没有农民种粮食工人没有饭吃，没有工人织布农民便没有衣穿”等，对巩固工农联盟在政治上和经济上的重大意义则认识不足。因此，今后在巩固工农联盟的教育当中，还必须继续加强向职工进行党在国家过渡时期的总路线的教育，还必须向职工系统地解释党对农民和农业生产的政策，以及工人和农民、工业和农业、城市和乡村必须密切配合，互相支援的道理。为此，就需要教育职工，使他们懂得：农民是工人阶级最可靠的同盟军，工农联盟是建设社会主义的基本力量，是一切战线上的胜利保障。只有工人和农民、工业和农业、城市和乡村密切结合，互相支援，才能把我国建成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。应该向职工指出：为了巩固工农联盟，工人阶级最重要的责任就是发挥劳动的积极性和创造性，保证全面完成与争取超额完成国家计划，从发展工业生产来支援农业，以改进和提高农业生产。
    第二、教育职工正确地认识工人阶级的领导地位及其具体责任。这一点过去对职工教育不够，所以在这次进行工农联欢的活动中，就发现有些工人有不少的糊涂思想。如有的工人参观农业生产合作社和互助组以后，看到农民进步的一面，便认为自己从来也没有领导过农民，而农民比工人阶级还进步，说农民是“根”，工人是“花”，甚至有些干部也说：“工人作领导，我也不服气”。另一方面，某些职工则由于在这次访问中受到农民普遍的赞扬，增长了自满情绪。因此，就要使职工群众懂得：工人阶级的领导是通过共产党来实现的，是通过共产党的组织向农民灌输社会主义思想，以引导农民完成社会主义改造；而职工群众的具体责任就是以发展工业生产、实现社会主义工业化，为农业集体化和近代化准备技术条件，并以工人阶级的集体主义思想和创造性的劳动来影响和带动农民，使农民走社会主义集体化的道路。
    第三、巩固工农联盟，不但应该表现在党和政府的政策方面，也应该表现在工人群众与农民群众的日常生活方面。这是今年春节期间进行的工农联盟教育工作所证明了的一项重要经验。因此，应该发动职工与厂矿附近的农民建立经常的联系，以便通过日常生活的接触，在生产上、生活上互相关心，相互帮助解决可能解决的具体困难，以及通过各种政治活动随时向农民进行社会主义宣传，提高农民觉悟，帮助农民逐步地走上互助合作的道路。同时，也要使工人了解农业生产合作社、农业集体化的意义，来克服某些工人中的小生产者的思想。
    工农联盟是我国人民民主专政的基础，是建设社会主义社会的基本力量，因此，继续向职工群众进行工农联盟的教育以进一步巩固工农联盟，这是今后长时期内要经常进行的一项重要工作。
