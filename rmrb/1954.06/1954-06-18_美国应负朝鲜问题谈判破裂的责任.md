    The meeting of the Geneva Conference to discuss the Korean issue has been unilaterally and arrogantly declared broken by the representatives of the United States and other countries that invaded Korea. The Korean issue talks, which lasted for fifty-one days and held fifteen plenary sessions, failed to reach any minimum agreement due to the consistent obstruction and sabotage by the United States.

    The United States and its followers' declaration of the breakdown of the meeting is unreasonable and unfounded. The so-called "Sixteen-Nation Joint Declaration" concocted by the United States distorts the truth and reverses black and white, but other than showing that the United States is the culprit in the breakdown of the Geneva Conference on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, it will absolutely not achieve any other purpose.

    The United States and the so-called "Sixteen-Nation Joint Declaration" cannot cover up the fact that the breakdown of the talks was not due to the Geneva Conference having no possibility of continuing discussions on the already agreed or nearly agreed basis for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, and seeking an agreement. The breakdown of the talks was solely due to the United States' insistence on its own way and refusal to negotiate. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov affirmed at the June 5th meeting that there were some agreements on the Korean issue and suggested consultations on various disagreements. Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai also pointed out at the June 11th meeting: "We have already achieved many agreed or nearly agreed opinions on the discussion of the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. We have no reason to stop moving forward, and we have no reason not to continue discussions and seek agreements based on Mr. Molotov's proposal." This conclusion and suggestion of the Chinese and Soviet delegations conformed to the actual situation, as can be verified by the meeting records, and was recognized by representatives of some Western countries and public opinion in various countries. The "Sixteen-Nation Joint Declaration" stubbornly claims that "in reality, there is no agreement" and that "continued consideration and study of the Korean issue will be of no use." This arbitrary statement even contradicts the attitudes previously expressed by representatives of some Western countries. For example, British representative Eden listed many common points and expressed that "we have so many things in common that we should not feel disappointed in seeking a solution." How should this obvious contradiction be explained? It is very clear that the "Sixteen-Nation Joint Declaration" violates the wishes of some countries that were forced to agree to this declaration. The US delegation consistently refused to consider the reasonable suggestions of the DPRK, Chinese, and Soviet delegations, nor did it respect the wishes of some Western countries' representatives, but instead simply negated and expanded the differences, and finally brazenly forced the end of the talks. Isn't it very obvious that the United States is dragging its allies to share the responsibility for undermining the meeting?

      The "Sixteen-Nation Joint Declaration" even disregards the facts, saying that
  "The delegations of the Communist countries have consistently rejected all our efforts to seek agreement," and shamelessly claiming that "we have been earnestly and patiently seeking a basis for agreement." This is a completely standard American-style rogue statement.

    The ironclad fact is that the DPRK, China, and the Soviet Union have not only consistently advocated a peaceful solution to the Korean issue in the past, but also, at the Geneva Conference, have been seeking an agreement on the Korean issue from beginning to end in the spirit of consultation and reconciliation. On the second day of the Geneva Conference, DPRK Foreign Minister Nam Il put forward the "Plan for Restoring the National Unity of Korea and Holding Free All-Korean Elections," suggesting the withdrawal of all foreign armed forces within a time limit, and holding all-Korean elections for the National Assembly based on the free will of all Korean residents, in order to quickly restore the national unity of Korea and establish a unified, independent, and democratic Korea. This reasonable and feasible proposal was supported by the Chinese and Soviet delegations and sympathized with by public opinion in various countries. Despite the indisputable rationality of these suggestions, the DPRK, Chinese, and Soviet delegations did not, therefore, demand that other countries accept them in their entirety, but rather expressed their willingness to jointly consult on this basis to seek an agreement. Because the US delegation rejected Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal without any reason, insisting that free all-Korean elections were impossible without international supervision, Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, at the May 22nd meeting, put forward a supplementary proposal to Foreign Minister Nam Il's suggestion, proposing that neutral countries implement international supervision of the free elections in Korea; at the same time, Foreign Minister Nam Il expressed his agreement to this, and stated that the proposal he put forward did not ignore the principle that the all-Korean National Assembly should be produced by proportional representation, in order to clarify the propaganda distorting the facts spread by the American side. At that time, anyone without prejudice could not but admit that this effort by the DPRK and China delegations allowed the meeting to break the deadlock created by the United States and continue the discussion.

    The sincere efforts of the DPRK, Chinese, and Soviet delegations were particularly evident and prominent when the United States intensified its efforts to plot the breakdown of the meeting. At the thirteenth and fourteenth meetings discussing the Korean issue, the DPRK, Chinese, and Soviet delegations firmly opposed the interruption of the meeting and strove to continue consultations. At the fifteenth meeting, where the United States gathered sixteen countries that invaded Korea to announce the breakdown of the meeting, the DPRK, Chinese, and Soviet delegations made great efforts: Foreign Minister Nam Il put forward a six-point proposal to guarantee the state of peace in Korea; Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai suggested that representatives from China, the Soviet Union, the DPRK, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and South Korea jointly study Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal to consolidate peace in Korea; Foreign Minister Molotov then suggested that the countries participating in the meeting issue a joint declaration guaranteeing that they would not take any actions that might threaten the maintenance of peace in Korea. Finally, when the above suggestions of the DPRK, Chinese, and Soviet delegations were all brazenly rejected by the US delegation, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, in order to save the meeting from breaking down, put forward the most conciliatory suggestion of the lowest limit, which was:
  "The countries participating in the Geneva Conference reach an agreement that they will continue to strive to reach an agreement on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue on the basis of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic Korean state. The time and place for resuming appropriate negotiations will be agreed upon separately by the countries concerned." The DPRK, Chinese, and Soviet delegations made sincere and exhaustive suggestions and concessions at the Geneva Conference in an attitude of striving for reconciliation. Even when the other party read out the so-called "Sixteen-Nation Joint Declaration" and broke off the talks, they insisted that the countries concerned should continue to work to resume negotiations on a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

    But how did the US delegation and its followers "seek a basis for agreement"? The US delegation did not put forward a single suggestion, but only refused to negotiate from beginning to end, insisted on unreasonable demands, never made any compromises or concessions, and engaged in slander and abuse. After the meeting had been going on for nearly a month, it drove the Rhee Syngman representative to put forward a so-called "fourteen-point proposal," and then used this "proposal" to plot the interruption of the talks. This "proposal" is the unreasonable demand insisted upon by the US delegation, and it is also the "two principles" flaunted by the "Sixteen-Nation Joint Declaration." It is to have the United Nations, one of the belligerents, help the Rhee Syngman clique rule the entire Korea, turning the entire Korea into a colony of the United States and a springboard for further aggression against China. The US delegation's so-called "always earnestly and patiently seeking a basis for agreement" is to force the Geneva Conference to accept the arrogant plan it wanted to realize when it launched the war of aggression against Korea without any change. That is, what they could not get on the battlefield, they wanted to forcibly obtain at the conference table. Any honest person can see clearly that the United States' adoption of this arrogant stance is to undermine the Korean issue talks, so that the United States can step up the expansion of the Rhee Syngman puppet army to deepen international tensions. Now the United States' Van Fleet is in Korea undertaking this shameful act of antagonizing the Asian people's desire for peace. The US delegation actually trotted out this kind of so-called principle to prove that their breakdown of the meeting was justified. Isn't this an extremely crude manipulation of international consultation and a shameless provocation to peace-loving people and countries around the world?

    The US delegation not only unilaterally and unreasonably terminated the Geneva Conference's discussion of seeking a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, but also refused to continue seeking solutions in the future, and refused to undertake the obligation to guarantee that peace in Korea would not be threatened. At the final meeting, Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's suggestion to continue working for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue in the future, although seconded by the Belgian representative and affirmed by Chairman Eden, was still stubbornly rejected by US representative Smith. This attitude of the US delegation clearly affirmed that the US ruling clique has, from beginning to end, deliberately undermined the peaceful solution of the Korean issue, and exposed the new and evil conspiracy harbored by the US ruling clique, which is to strive for the resurgence of the Korean War.

    Recent facts have already proved that the US ruling clique attempts to continue pursuing its arrogant policy of aggression in Korea and Asia, maintaining and creating tensions in Korea and Asia, and preparing for new military adventures. The Rhee Syngman clique is clamoring to implement the "military unification" plan, and Byun Young-tae is even clamoring that South Korea "no longer considers itself obliged to abide by the armistice agreement." The US war-monger Van Fleet is hurriedly running between Washington, Tokyo, Seoul, and Taiwan, precisely in order to carry out military deployments, collect cannon fodder, and organize the so-called "anti-communist alliance." All these activities of the United States have seriously threatened peace and security in Asia.

    Although the US delegation and its followers have terminated the Geneva Conference's discussion of the Korean issue, the Korean issue has not and cannot be erased from the agenda of international consultations. Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's suggestion to resume negotiations in the future has been included as part of the meeting record. The delegations of the DPRK, China, and the Soviet Union have all stated their willingness to continue to struggle to consolidate peace in Korea and peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

    The efforts of the DPRK, Chinese, and Soviet delegations to patiently seek agreement on the Korean issue stand in sharp contrast to the destructive attitude consistently maintained by the United States. It allows the people of the world, especially the people of Asia, to clearly see who is seeking peace and who is obstructing peace; who is a sincere supporter of peace and who is a stubborn enemy of peace! The US imperialists will inevitably not be able to escape the angry accusations and opposition of the Asian people and the peace-loving people of the world. More and more peace-loving people will be more united and carry out a more heroic struggle to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue and to resolutely stop the US imperialists' evil conspiracy to undermine peace. The United States' arrogance in unilaterally breaking the Geneva Conference on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue makes the Chinese people deeply realize that they must be more vigilant against US imperialism, strengthen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement, strengthen solidarity with the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the various people's democratic countries, and strengthen solidarity with the peace-loving people of the world, in order to realize our country's foreign policy, which is, as stated in the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China: "In international affairs, our country's unwavering policy is to strive for the noble purpose of world peace and human progress." In the Geneva Conference on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, the truth is entirely on our side, and the sympathy of the peace-loving people of the world is also entirely on our side. The delegation of our country, headed by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, faithfully carried out the instructions of the people of a great country that upholds justice and peace, and our country's international status and international prestige have been greatly improved. The Korean armistice is not allowed to be undermined, and the peace-loving people of the world have the power to fight to consolidate peace in Korea. Any pessimism and disappointment are unfounded. The United States and its lackeys can unilaterally break the Geneva Conference on the Korean issue, but they have no power to change the situation in Korea. If the US warmongers foolishly dare to carry out new military provocations in Korea, then the people of Korea and China, together with the peace-loving people of the world, will inevitably give them a heavier blow and make them suffer even greater failures!

### 美国应负朝鲜问题谈判破裂的责任

    美国应负朝鲜问题谈判破裂的责任
    日内瓦会议讨论朝鲜问题的会议，已被美国及其他侵朝国家代表蛮横地片面地宣布破裂了。历时五十一天、举行了十五次全体会议的朝鲜问题会谈，由于美国自始至终的阻挠和破坏，未能达成任何最低限度的协议。
    美国和它的追随者宣布会议的破裂，是毫无道理，毫无根据的。美国一手制定的所谓“十六国共同宣言”，歪曲真相，颠倒黑白，但是，这除了说明美国是破裂日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的会谈的罪魁祸首以外，绝对达不到任何别的目的。
    美国和所谓“十六国共同宣言”都无法掩盖这样一个事实，会谈的破裂并非由于日内瓦会议没有可能对和平解决朝鲜问题在已经一致或接近一致的基础上继续讨论，并求得协议。会谈的破裂只是由于美国的一意孤行，拒绝协商。苏联莫洛托夫外长在六月五日的会议上肯定地表示，在朝鲜问题上已经有了一些一致的意见，并建议就各项分歧意见进行协商。我国周恩来外长也在六月十一日会议上指出：“我们对于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论，已经取得了不少一致或接近一致的意见。我们没有任何理由停止前进，我们没有理由不根据莫洛托夫先生的建议，继续讨论，寻求协议。”中苏两国代表团这个结论和建议之符合于实际情况，有会议纪录可以查考，并且为一些西方国家的代表和各国舆论所公认。“十六国共同宣言”硬说“实际上却没有协议”，“继续考虑和研究朝鲜问题是不会有什么用处的”。这个武断，甚至显然和一些西方国家代表曾经表示的态度都是不符的。例如，英国代表艾登就曾列举过许多共同之点，并表示“我们有了这么多共同的地方，我们不应该对求得解决感觉失望。”对于这种明显的矛盾，应该怎样来解释呢？很清楚，“十六国共同宣言”是违背了一些被迫同意这个宣言的国家的愿望的。美国代表团一贯地既不愿考虑朝、中、苏三国的合理建议，也不尊重某些西方国家代表们的愿望，一味否定，扩大分歧，最后悍然强制结束了会谈。美国硬拖住它的盟国来分担破坏会议的责任，不是十分明显的吗？
      “十六国共同宣言”居然抹煞事实，说什么
  “共产党国家的代表团始终拒绝我们谋求协议的一切努力”，并大言不惭地自称“我们一直在认真地耐心地寻求一个协议的基础”。这完全是标准的美国式的无赖之词。
    铁一般的事实是，朝、中、苏三国不仅在过去一贯主张和平解决朝鲜问题，而且在日内瓦会议上也自始至终本着协商与和解的精神，谋求达成朝鲜问题的协议。在日内瓦会议开始的第二天，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相就提出了“关于恢复朝鲜的国家统一和举行全朝鲜自由选举的方案”，建议限期撤退一切外国武装力量，在全朝鲜居民表示自由意志的基础上举行国民议会的全朝鲜选举，以迅速恢复朝鲜国家的统一，并建立一个统一的独立的民主的朝鲜。这个合理可行的建议，得到了中苏两国代表团的支持和各国公众舆论的同情。尽管这些建议的合理性是无可争辩的，但是朝、中、苏代表团并没有因此就要求其他国家全盘接受，而是表示愿意在这个基础上共同协商以谋求协议。由于美国代表团毫无理由地一口拒绝南日外务相的建议，坚持没有国际监督不可能举行全朝鲜自由选举，我国周恩来外长于五月二十二日会议上，又对南日外务相的建议提出了由中立国对朝鲜的自由选举实行国际监察的补充建议；同时南日外务相对此表示同意，并声明他所提出的建议并没有忽视全朝鲜国会应该按比例代表制产生的原则，以澄清美国方面所散布的歪曲事实的宣传。当时任何没有成见的人都不能不承认，朝中两国代表团的这一努力，使会议得以打开美国所造成的僵持局面，继续进行讨论。
    朝、中、苏三国代表团的真诚努力，在最近美国加紧策划破裂会议的活动的时候，特别显明突出地表现出来。在讨论朝鲜问题的第十三、第十四次会议上，朝、中、苏三国代表团坚决反对中断会议，力争继续协商。在美国纠集侵朝十六国宣布会议破裂的十五次会议上，朝、中、苏三国代表团又作了巨大的努力：南日外务相提出了保证朝鲜和平状态的六点建议；周恩来外长建议由中、苏、朝、英、美、法和南朝鲜代表共同研究南日外务相的建议，以巩固朝鲜的和平；莫洛托夫外长接着建议由参加会议各国发表共同宣言，保证不采取任何可能足以对维持朝鲜和平构成威胁的行动。最后，当朝、中、苏三国代表团的上述建议都被美国代表团横蛮拒绝后，周恩来外长为了挽救会议使之免于破裂，提出了最低限度的最具有和解性的建议，这个建议是：
  “日内瓦会议与会国家达成协议，它们将继续努力以期在建立统一、独立和民主的朝鲜国家的基础上达成和平解决朝鲜问题的协议。关于恢复适当谈判的时间和地点问题，将由有关国家另行商定。”朝、中、苏三国代表团在日内瓦会议上以力求和解的态度，作了仁至义尽的建议与让步，直到对方宣读所谓“十六国共同宣言”，破裂会谈的时候，还坚持有关各国应该继续努力，来恢复和平解决朝鲜问题的谈判。
    但是，美国代表团和它的追随者究竟怎样“寻求一个协议的基础”的呢？美国代表团根本没有提出过一个建议，而只是自始至终拒绝协商，坚持无理要求，从来没作任何妥协或让步，并进行诽谤谩骂。在会议进行了近一个月后，才驱使李承晚代表提出一个所谓“十四点建议”，然后就拿这个“建议”来策划中断会谈。这个“建议”就是美国代表团所坚持的无理主张，也就是“十六国共同宣言”所标榜的“两个原则”。它就是要由交战一方的联合国来帮助李承晚集团统治全朝鲜，把全朝鲜变为美国的殖民地和进一步侵略中国的跳板。美国代表团所谓“一直在认真地耐心地寻求一个协议的基础”，就是原封不动地把它在发动侵朝战争时所要实现的狂妄计划，强迫日内瓦会议来接受它。也就是它们在战场上得不到的东西，想在会议桌上来强求得到。任何正直的人都看得清，美国采取这种狂妄的立场，就是为了破坏朝鲜问题的商谈，以便美国加紧扩充李承晚伪军，来加深国际紧张局势。现在美国的范佛里特就正在朝鲜担当这个与亚洲人民的和平愿望为敌的可耻勾当。美国代表团居然还搬出这种所谓原则来证明它们破裂会议是正当的，岂不是对国际协商的极端粗暴的玩弄，对全世界爱好和平的人民和国家的无耻挑衅吗？
    美国代表团不仅横蛮无理地片面终止日内瓦会议谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论，而且拒绝在今后继续寻求解决的可能性，拒绝承担保证朝鲜和平不受威胁的义务。在最后结束的会议上，我国周恩来外长提出今后继续努力谋求朝鲜问题和平解决的建议，虽然得到了比利时代表的附议，并为担任主席的艾登所肯定，但美国代表史密斯仍蛮横拒绝就这一点达成协议。美国代表团的这种态度，清楚地肯定了美国统治集团，自始至终蓄意破坏朝鲜问题的和平解决，暴露了美国统治集团所怀抱的不可告人的新的罪恶阴谋，这个阴谋就是力求朝鲜战争之再起。
    最近就已有事实证明，美国统治集团企图在朝鲜和亚洲继续推行其狂妄的侵略政策，保持和制造朝鲜和亚洲的紧张局势，并准备新的军事冒险。李承晚集团正在叫嚣实行“武力统一”计划，卞荣泰更在喧嚷南朝鲜“不再认为有遵守停战协定的义务”。美国侵朝战贩范佛里特匆匆忙忙地奔走于华盛顿、东京、汉城和台湾之间，也就是为了进行军事布置，搜罗炮灰，组织所谓“反共联盟”。美国这一切活动，已严重地威胁到亚洲的和平和安全。
    美国代表团和它的追随者虽然终止了日内瓦会议对朝鲜问题的讨论，但朝鲜问题并没有、也不可能从国际协商的议程上一笔勾销。我国周恩来外长关于今后恢复谈判的建议已作为会议记录的一部分。朝、中、苏三国代表团都声明愿为巩固朝鲜和平与和平解决朝鲜问题而继续奋斗。
    朝、中、苏三国代表团就朝鲜问题所作的耐心寻求协议的努力和美国一贯坚持的破坏态度形成了尖锐的对照。它使世界人民，特别是亚洲人民，逼真地看清，谁在谋求和平，谁在阻挠和平；谁是和平的真诚拥护者，谁是和平的顽固的敌人！美帝国主义者必将不能逃脱亚洲人民和世界爱好和平人民愤怒的指责和反对，越来越多的爱好和平人民必将更加团结一致，为谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决，为坚决制止美帝国主义者破坏和平的罪恶阴谋而进行更英勇的斗争。美国蛮横地片面地破裂日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的谈判，使中国人民深刻地认识到必须对美国帝国主义更加提高警惕，加强抗美援朝运动，加强与苏联、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国以及各人民民主国家的团结，加强与全世界爱好和平的人民的团结，来实现我国的对外政策，这就是中华人民共和国宪法草案里所说的：“在国际事务中，我国坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。”在日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的谈判中，真理完全在我们方面，全世界爱好和平的人民的同情也完全在我们方面。以周恩来外长为首的我国代表团忠实地执行了一个主持正义与和平的伟大国家的人民的嘱咐，我国的国际地位和国际声望大大提高了。朝鲜停战是不容许被破坏的，世界爱好和平的人民是有力量来为巩固朝鲜和平而斗争的，任何悲观失望都是毫无根据的。美国及其仆从们能够片面地破裂日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的谈判，但决没有力量改变朝鲜的局面。假如美国好战分子愚蠢地胆敢在朝鲜进行新的军事挑衅，那么，朝中两国人民和世界爱好和平的人民一起，必将给他们以更沉重的打击，使他们遭受到更大的失败！
