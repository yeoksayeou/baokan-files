Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 5th: In May, Anshan Iron and Steel Company overfulfilled the production plans for thirteen major products, including steel ingots, steel billets, large steel, seamless steel pipes, and medium steel. The quality of all products met standards.

In May, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's production plants and mines universally convened representative meetings on technical measures, and some new improvements emerged in production technology. For example, after the primary rolling mill renovated the pass design of the 24-stand rolling mill and built a new hot-blast stove, the steel rolling capacity of the primary rolling mill increased by about 5%. The Yingtaoyuan Mine installed "wind frames" on rock drills and used hard alloy drill bits, increasing production efficiency by one-third. The Refractory Materials Plant implemented the "loose installation with gaps, flat installation with stable padding" bricklaying method proposed by Soviet experts, increasing the finished product rate of magnesia bricks to 99.2%.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 5th: Yumen Mining Bureau overfulfilled the state production plans for various major products in May. This is the best month for completing the plan this year.

In May, oil extraction workers strengthened systematic well testing and management of newly commissioned oil wells, and carried out effective repairs on some old wells, so that the total crude oil production overfulfilled the state plan by 11%, and the quality also met standards. The refinery, under the premise of ensuring safe operation, overfulfilled the state plan for gasoline production by 21.65% and kerosene production by 11.48%. Other major products, such as light machine oil, heavy machine oil, paraffin wax, and match wax, also overfulfilled the production plan. The plant's overall labor productivity increased by 15%, and the total cost decreased by just over 4%. In addition, Yumen Mining Bureau's various construction engineering teams also overfulfilled the May tasks of installing oil selection stations, laying oil pipelines, constructing houses, leveling well sites, and repairing roads.

Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 5th: The major factories and mines in Fushun, the coal capital, such as the Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 1, Fushun Mining Bureau, Fushun Steel Plant, Fushun Power Plant, and Fushun Cement Plant, completed their production plans in May, expanded the supply range of important products, and increased the supply volume. The Fushun Mining Bureau broke through the scope of only supplying many industrial cities in the Northeast region and began to support Shanghai's construction with high-grade industrial power coal. The gasoline production of Petroleum Plant No. 1 exceeded that of April by nearly 40%, and the production of crude oil and diesel also increased. Therefore, in addition to supplying the transportation departments that were originally supplied, Petroleum Plant No. 1 also increased the supply of diesel to Songjiang Province, Heilongjiang Province, and various state-owned farms and tractor stations in the Northeast during the busy farming season in May.

In the technical innovation movement, the employees of many factories and mines in Fushun City actively used and promoted advanced operating techniques. Workers in the No. 1 furnace of Petroleum Plant No. 1 adjusted the fire bed at any time according to the changes in the particle size and oil content of oil shale, and carried out "advancing and retreating" operations, so that the crude oil production in May greatly exceeded the plan. The plant's engineering and technical personnel and technical workers also carried out research on refining operations, and extracted a large amount of light diesel and gasoline and other light oils urgently needed for national construction from heavy oil. In May, coal selection workers in Fushun's coal mines and open-pit coal mines also launched a labor competition to improve coal quality according to the needs of users.

    五月份许多主要产品的生产计划超额完成
    抚顺主要厂矿五月份扩大重要产品的供应范围
    【新华社鞍山五日电】五月份，鞍山钢铁公司有钢锭、钢坯、大型钢材、无缝钢管、中型钢材等十三种主要产品超额完成了生产计划。产品的质量都合乎标准。
    鞍山钢铁公司各生产厂矿五月份普遍召开了技术措施代表会议，在生产技术方面出现了一些新的改进。如初轧厂改造二十四连轧机的孔型和新建一座热风炉后，使初轧机轧钢能力提高了百分之五左右。樱桃园矿山在凿岩机上安装了“风架子”，并使用了硬质合金钎头，使生产效率提高了三分之一。耐火材料厂贯彻苏联专家提出的“松装拉缝，平装垫稳”的装砖法，使镁砖的成品率提高到百分之九十九点二。
    【新华社西安五日电】玉门矿务局各种主要产品都超额完成了五月份的国家生产计划。这是今年以来完成计划最好的一个月。
    五月里，采油工人对新投入生产的油井加强了系统试井和管理工作，对一些旧井进行了有效的修理，使原油总产量超额百分之十一完成了国家计划，质量也合乎标准。炼油厂在保证了安全操作的条件下，汽油产量超额百分之二十一点六五、煤油产量超额百分之十一点四八完成了国家计划，其他主要产品如轻机油、重机油、白蜡、火柴蜡等也都超额完成了产量计划。全厂劳动生产率提高了百分之十五，总成本降低了百分之四强。此外，玉门矿务局各建筑工程队也都超额完成了五月份的选油站安装、敷设输油管线、建筑房屋、平井场和修公路的任务。
    【新华社抚顺五日电】煤都抚顺的东北石油一厂、抚顺矿务局、抚顺钢厂、抚顺发电厂、抚顺水泥厂等主要厂矿，在五月份完成了生产计划，扩大了重要产品的供应范围，提高了供应量。抚顺矿务局突破了历来只供应东北地区许多工业城市的范围，开始以高级的工业动力用煤支援上海的建设。石油一厂的汽油产量比四月份超过了将近百分之四十，原油、柴油的产量也有了提高。因此石油一厂五月份除供应原来供应的交通部门外，还增加了对农忙中的松江省、黑龙江省和东北各国营农场、拖拉机站的柴油供应量。
    在技术革新运动中，抚顺市许多厂矿的职工都积极运用和推广先进的操作技术。石油一厂一部炉的工人们根据油母页岩的粒度和含油率的变动情况，随时调整火层，进行“有进有退”的操作，使五月份的原油产量大大超过计划。该厂工程技术人员、技术工人并进行了精炼操作的研究，在重油中大量提炼出国家建设迫切需要的轻柴油、汽油等轻质油。抚顺各煤井，露天煤矿的选煤工人们也根据用户的需要，在五月份开展了改善煤炭质量的劳动竞赛。
