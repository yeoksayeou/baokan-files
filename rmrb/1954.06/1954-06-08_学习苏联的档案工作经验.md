    Learning from the Soviet Union's Archival Work Experience
    Wang Fang
    Before the October Socialist Revolution, the archives of Russian state organs served only their own agencies. At that time, archives were decentralized; there were as many agency archives as there were central and local agencies, and there was no connection between the archives. Some central agencies, in addition to their own current agency archives, also collected ancient documents related to their agencies and established their own historical archives. At the same time, due to the development of capitalism, many private enterprises and banks also established their own archives. However, whether it was government agency or private enterprise archives, only those loyal to the Tsar and the owners of the enterprises could use them, and the archives became a tool for exploiting the people. The Tsarist government did not care about archives; in the agencies at that time, archival documents were often destroyed or sold as commodities. The bourgeois Provisional Government, established in February 1917, handled archives even worse than the Tsarist government because it foresaw the instability of its rule; large quantities of archives were hidden, dispersed, stolen, and destroyed, leaving the archives in complete chaos.

    After the great October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet regime abolished the state organs of the bourgeoisie, but at the same time took all measures to preserve the archives of these organs, using these archives as a tool to consolidate the working-class state. In June 1918, Lenin signed the "Decree on the Reorganization and Centralization of Archival Work." This decree became the basis of the entire Soviet archival construction. This decree abolished the ownership of archives by various agencies and stipulated that the archival materials of various agencies before the revolution and the archival materials of various Soviet agencies should form a unified national archival system; the archival materials before the revolution were all under state management, and the archival materials of various agencies after the revolution were temporarily kept in the agencies for a certain period before being sent to the state unified archives for preservation. In order to manage the unified national archival system, the decree stipulated the establishment of the Central Archival Administration under the People's Commissariat of Education, and stipulated that no agency could destroy any documents without the written approval of the Central Archival Administration.

    The implementation of this decree signed by Lenin changed the decentralized and backward state of archival work in the old Russia, and for the first time formed a unified and centralized national archival work system from the interests of the workers and peasants, making archives serve the interests of the people of the whole country. It showed the world that only a country where workers and peasants hold power can correctly solve the problem of archival centralization. From then on, all important issues of Soviet archival construction were carried out under the orders and instructions of the Soviet government.

    During the period of opposition to imperialist intervention and the domestic war, in order to do everything possible to rescue archival documents, the Soviet government approved the "Decree on the Preservation and Destruction of Archives" on March 30, 1919. This decree stipulated the period for which Soviet agencies and organizations should preserve documents (then stipulated as five years) and the rules for destroying archival documents, ensuring that archival documents would not be massively destroyed. At the same time, the "Decision on Military Archives" was promulgated to collect and protect all archives of the army. In May of the same year, the Central Archival Administration notified all private archival owners to send their own archives to the state archives for preservation; in July of the same year, the Council of People's Commissars promulgated the "Decree signed by Lenin on Abolishing the Ownership of Archives of Deceased Russian Writers, Composers, and Scholars by Libraries and Museums," thus ensuring that a large number of private archives would not be lost. In March 1919, Lenin also signed the "Regulations on Provincial Archives" in order to collect and protect local archives.

    During the period of restoring the national economy, in order to adapt to the new tasks of archival work, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee promulgated the "Decree on Reorganizing Archival Organs" on January 30, 1922. The Central Archival Administration and local branches were established under the All-Russian and local Soviet Executive Committees to replace the previous Central Archival Administration under the People's Commissariat of Education. The various republics also established central archives and central archival administrations in imitation of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. In order to prevent class enemies from sneaking into the archives to destroy and sell valuable documents, the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee passed the "Circular on Opposing the Destruction of Archival Documents" on June 9, 1922, strictly prohibiting the sale of archives as waste paper, and those who violated it would be subject to legal sanctions.

    During the period of restoring the national economy, the archival organs of the Soviet state basically completed the work of concentrating the archival documents before the revolution into the state archives. This raised the issue of how to centralize the archives of various Soviet agencies after the revolution in front of the archival organs. Since the archival work situation of various agencies was not very regular at that time, the Central Archives formulated the "System for Receiving and Preserving Archival Documents by the Document Processing Departments of Archives Rooms" in early 1925, which stipulated in detail how the offices of agencies should transfer documents to the agency archives, how to sort out and preserve the documents in the archives, how long the archives should be kept, and under what circumstances the documents should be sent to the state archives. This regulation of 1925 was later revised and supplemented, and it is still a regulation that must be observed by various Soviet agencies.

    When the Soviet Union entered the period of socialist industrialization, it was required to have good archival work to serve the country's economic construction. In February 1926, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee passed the "Resolution on Sorting out the Documents from 1917 to 1921 and Transferring them to the Archives." According to this resolution, central agencies, organizations, and enterprises should transfer documents to the National Central Archives within the specified time; the documents of local agencies should be transferred to the National Local Archives. In February of the same year, the Council of People's Commissars of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic passed the "Decree on Transferring Photo and Film Archives to the National Archives." This decree stipulated that photos and films that can reflect social and political phenomena and have revolutionary historical significance should be transferred to the National Archives five years after their production. This made the archival materials recording the country's political and social life comprehensively centralized, and not limited to written documents.

    By the end of socialist industrialization, the central and local state archives had concentrated the archival documents of many agencies and organizations, but the documents received had not yet been sorted out. The new tasks required the work of the archives to be more precise. In January 1929, the Soviet government approved the "Regulations of the Archival Administration of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic." This regulation determined the tasks and rights of the archival organs. The regulation stipulated that the documents of all agencies, enterprises, and organizations should be transferred to the state archives ten years after their production, the documents of rural Soviets should be transferred after three years, and photos and films should be transferred after five years. If the current agency still needs to use them, the transfer can be postponed, but not for more than twenty-five years. The regulation also stipulated the system for selecting documents that need to be preserved and destroyed. Various agencies appraise the preservation or destruction of documents according to the list of document retention periods, and the documents sent to the state archives are documents that need to be permanently preserved.

    In April 1929, the Soviet government passed the "Resolution on Establishing the Central Archival Administration of the Soviet Union." The establishment of the Central Archival Administration of the Soviet Union was to lead the central archival administrations of the various republics and manage the archival system of all-Soviet significance. In March 1929, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) approved the resolution to establish the Party Central Archives within the Lenin Institute. Local Party Archives were established under the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the various republics and the Party committees of various border regions and provinces. These archives became branches of the Party Central Archives and were directly led by the Lenin Institute.

    During the period of realizing agricultural collectivization and transforming all sectors of the national economy, the Soviet government took all measures to preserve the documents of collective farms, state farms, and agricultural machinery stations. In October 1933, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee passed the "Resolution on Sorting out the Archives of Collective Farms, State Farms, and Agricultural Machinery Stations." This resolution stipulated that it is absolutely forbidden to destroy any documents of collective farms, state farms, and agricultural machinery stations without the permission of the archival organs, and ordered collective farms, state farms, and agricultural machinery stations to select special personnel to be responsible for the preservation of archives. In December 1934, the Soviet government approved the "Resolution on Organizing District Archives." The organization of district archives was to protect, collect, and utilize the documents of lower-level Soviet agencies, collective farms, state farms, and agricultural machinery stations.

    In order to train archival cadres, the Soviet government passed the resolution on establishing the Archival College in September 1930. The Archival College opened in April 1931. Now this college is renamed the Historical Archives College, and it is training skilled archival work cadres.

    In August 1931, the Council of People's Commissars of the Russian Federation published a special resolution on the utilization of archival documents, recommending that central and local agencies consult the relevant archival documents from the archival organs before formulating construction drafts or equipment plans and conducting geological surveys, in order to utilize the archival documents to serve socialist construction and save construction funds and manpower. Other republics also published similar resolutions.

    The increasing victory of socialist construction, the prosperity of science and culture, especially the compilation of Marxist history textbooks, all require a more thorough improvement of the work of archives and archival management organs. The Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union passed a special resolution on June 27, 1935, stipulating measures to rectify archival work in the Soviet Union. On February 5, 1936, it passed another resolution on rectifying the archival work of various People's Commissariats and central agencies of the Soviet Union. These resolutions stipulated further improving archival work from the aspects of archive equipment, training of archival staff, and the system of archive preservation and destruction, in order to accelerate the sorting of documents in the archives and make archival documents better serve socialism.

    On April 16, 1938, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued an order transferring the Central Archival Administration of the Soviet Union to the leadership of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs in order to further consolidate the archival construction work of the central and local governments.

    Thanks to the various measures implemented by the Soviet Communist Party and government in the Soviet archival construction, a unified national archival work system has been established in the more than 30 years since the founding of the Soviet Union, a national-scale state archival management agency and a network of archives for preserving state archives have been established. Now, a brief description of these aspects is given:

    Within the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs, there is a Central Archival Administration, and archival administrations are also set up in the Ministries of Internal Affairs of various republics, autonomous republics, border regions, and provinces. The task of the Central Archival Administration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is to lead all archival construction work in the Soviet state. It is responsible for studying and proposing draft orders, regulations, and instructions on archival work, submitting them to the government for approval and promulgation; leading the work of central and local state archives; supervising the work of central and local agency, organization, and enterprise archives; leading the scientific appraisal of archival materials in central and local agencies and approving the destruction of documents that do not need to be preserved, etc. The local archival administration assists the central archival administration in leading the archival work in the region. The archival administration is an archival administrative agency, not an archival preservation agency.

    The agencies that preserve the national archives are the central (all-Union and various republic) and local (autonomous republic, border region, province, district) state archives. The archival documents of all-Union agencies and organizations and archival documents of all-Union significance are preserved in the Central State Archives. At present, there are eight Central State Archives in the Soviet Union, which preserve the archival documents of ancient, pre-revolutionary, and post-revolutionary central state power organs, social organizations, military organizations, and other organizations, as well as archival documents of all-Soviet significance. In addition to the central archives of all-Union significance, the various republics also have their own central archives, preserving archival documents of republic significance. Each autonomous republic, border region, and province also has its own archives. Each district has district archives, preserving the documents of district and village agencies and organizations. The documents and materials of the district archives are transferred to the provincial state archives after ten years.

    Each agency and organization has its own archives room. The archives rooms of various agencies are under the direct leadership of the head of the agency and work in accordance with the unified national archival sorting and preservation system. The agency archives room transfers documents and materials to the state archives after a certain period.

    The documents and materials of the Soviet Communist Party are preserved in the Party Central Archives and local Party Archives directly under the Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin Institute. The documents of the Lenin Communist Youth League are also preserved in the Party Archives.

    The Soviet state archives maintain close contact with scientific research institutions and government agencies in order to fully utilize archival documents and serve the country's political, economic, and cultural construction and the actual needs of the working people. The state archives often search for useful documents and materials according to topics for use by various agencies. By 1935, the Soviet archival organs had produced about 800,000 thematic cards, providing valuable materials for national economic construction, for the study of the history of the domestic war, the history of factories, and the history of the Party. For example, from 1935 to 1937, the archives issued approximately 450,000 inquiry certificates to the working people and more than 7,000 document certificates to Soviet agencies. During these three years, 13,000 researchers conducted scientific research in the reading rooms of the state archives. In addition, the archival organs have also carried out a lot of work in publishing documents, such as publishing "Collection of Documents on the Revolutionary Movement in the Latter Half of the Nineteenth Century," "Collection of Historical Documents on the 1905 Revolution," "International Relations in the Era of Imperialism," "The Workers' Movement in Nineteenth-Century Russia," "The Brutal Crimes of the German Fascist Bandits in Kharkov," and other document collections that explain history and expose the enemy. This work shows that archives are not warehouses for accumulating waste paper, but scientific research institutions that cooperate with national construction. At present, the Soviet archival organs are cooperating with communist construction to further improve the sorting of documents and materials.

    What can we learn from the history of Soviet archival construction?

    The Soviet Union is the first country in the world to correctly solve the problem of using archival materials to serve all working people by applying the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism. The experience of Soviet archival construction is very valuable to us. First of all, the Soviet experience in archival construction tells us that all archives of the country must be owned by the state and must be centrally preserved and used. Only a socialist country where workers and peasants hold power truly cares about the past achievements of the working people themselves, and can truly centralize archives and correctly organize archival work. Our country is a people's democratic country led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, and it is also entirely possible to do so. Therefore, archival workers across the country should take good care of the various archives we keep, and prepare to manage them centrally and uniformly in the future for the people to use.

    Secondly, it tells us that archival construction work is a national-scale affair, not an internal issue of various agencies, so archival work must be unified national work. In the Soviet Union, archival materials are treated as the wealth of all the people. Archival materials not only serve the temporary needs of the agency, but also serve the long-term needs of all the people, so there is a unified national archival work leadership agency, a network of central and local archives, and a unified national archival system. However, it is impossible to establish a unified national archival system and carry out measures to centralize national archival documents without the care and instructions of the Party and the government. This is not only because some agencies sometimes consider issues from the interests of their own agency, but also because there has been fierce class struggle in the process of Soviet archival construction. This is because class enemies are hidden in the archival work, and they try to disperse, hide, and destroy archival documents that are extremely valuable to the people of the whole country. They try their best to oppose the centralization of archives and oppose the state's supervision of archives. Therefore, every important measure in Soviet archival construction has a government order promulgated, has the supervision of the state management agency - the archival administration, and even sometimes has the protection of the state judicial security agency. Our agency staff must learn from the Soviet experience, take care of the long-term unified archival work when handling documents, especially when collecting and preserving archives, pay more attention to cherishing all old and new archives, learn the Soviet methods of sorting and preserving archives, and gradually build an archival work system suitable for our country's conditions, and gradually move towards the unification of national archival work.

    Third, the Soviet archival construction can achieve its current scale not only through long-term efforts, but also as a result of reform and construction with a revolutionary spirit to overcome various difficulties. The establishment of the Soviet state archives and archival organs started from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and gradually developed to other republics, and then the unified establishment of the all-Soviet archival management agency and the all-Soviet archives network. Even in the difficult years of the domestic war, when material conditions were very difficult, archival construction work was still carried out, and the Central Archival Administration was established to carry out the work of concentrating pre-revolutionary archival materials. At the same time, the Soviet Communist Party and government were also good at grasping the main links of archival construction in each period to carry out work, that is, first establishing the state's management agency for archival affairs in order to lead this undertaking in a comprehensive and unified way; in a period after the revolution, first seizing the work of rescuing the archival documents of pre-revolutionary agencies, and at the same time carrying out the work of collecting military archives; by the time the economic recovery period basically ended, the centralization of historical archives was completed, these were all urgent tasks. Later, in a period, the archival materials of Soviet agencies were concentrated, but at that time, the document processing and archival work of Soviet agencies had not yet been completely on the right track, and the concentrated archival materials were very chaotic, so the state promulgated unified regulations on the work of the current agency archives room. For example, when carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture, the Soviet government, in view of the fact that the documents of the agricultural socialist transformation had great scientific and political significance, took measures to collect and sort out the archives in this area and established district archives. These beneficial work experiences are all worthy of our reference. We can and should also accelerate the progress of certain steps to improve archival work by learning about the history of Soviet archival work today. For example, while collecting and sorting out old archives, we can use the Soviet experience to do many necessary preparatory work for the centralization of new archives, such as improving the agency's document processing and filing system, and improving the methods of sorting out document materials.

    Our country is now carrying out planned economic construction and cultural construction. The establishment and improvement of archival work has its active role in scientific research and economic construction, as well as in safeguarding Party and state secrets. Therefore, learning from the advanced experience of Soviet archival construction is very important for the smooth progress of our country's archival cause.

    学习苏联的档案工作经验
  　王方
    在十月社会主义革命前，俄国国家机关的档案只为本机关服务。当时档案是分散的，有多少中央和地方机关，就有多少机关档案馆，档案馆之间也没有联系。有些中央机关，除有自己的机关现行档案之外，还收集和本机关有关的古老文件，建立了自己的历史档案馆。同时，由于资本主义的发展，许多私人企业、银行也建立了自己的档案馆。但是，不管是政府机关或私人企业的档案，只有忠实于沙皇的人们和企业主才能利用，档案成为剥削人民的工具。沙皇政府是不关心档案的，在当时的机关中，档案文件常被销毁或当作商品出卖。一九一七年二月建立的资产阶级临时政府，因它预感到自己统治的不稳固，对档案的管理比沙皇政府时代更坏，大量的档案被隐藏、分散、盗窃和销毁，使档案馆完全处于混乱状态。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命后，苏维埃政权废除了资产阶级的国家机关，同时却采取一切办法保存了这些机关的档案，利用这些档案作为巩固工人阶级国家的工具。一九一八年六月列宁签署了“关于改革和集中档案工作”的法令。这一法令成为整个苏维埃档案建设的基础。这一法令废除了各机关对其档案的所有权，规定把革命前各机关的档案材料和苏维埃各机关的档案材料，组成了国家统一的档案总体；革命前的档案材料都归国家管理，革命后各机关的档案材料，暂在各机关保存一定期限以后，再送交国家统一档案库保存。为了管理国家统一的档案总体，该法令规定在教育人民委员部下成立档案总管理局，并规定一切机关未经档案总管理局的书面批准，不得销毁任何文件。
    列宁签署的这一法令的实行，改变了旧俄时代档案工作的分散和落后状况，第一次从工人农民的利益出发组成了全国统一集中的档案工作制度，使档案为全国人民的利益服务。它向全世界表明：只有工人农民掌握政权的国家，才能正确解决档案工作集中这一问题。从此以后，苏维埃档案建设的一切重要问题，都是在苏维埃政府的命令和指示之下进行的。
    在反对帝国主义干涉和国内战争时期，为了尽力抢救档案文件，一九一九年三月三十日，苏维埃政府批准了“关于保存和销毁档案”的法令，这个法令规定了苏维埃机关团体保存文件的期限（当时规定为五年）和销毁档案文件的规则，保证了档案文件免遭大量的销毁。同时又颁布了“关于军事档案的决定”，以收集和保护军队的一切档案。同年五月，档案总管理局通知一切私人档案所有者，把他们自己的档案送交国家档案库保存；同年七月，人民委员会颁布了列宁签署的“关于废除图书馆和博物馆对保存已故的俄国作家、作曲家、学者的档案所有权的法令”，因而使得大量的私人档案不致散失。一九一九年三月列宁又签署了“关于省档案的条例”，以便收集和保护地方性的档案。
    在恢复国民经济时期，为了适应档案工作的新任务，一九二二年一月三十日全俄中央执行委员会颁布了“关于改组档案机关”的法令，在全俄和地方苏维埃执行委员会下成立了中央档案管理局和地方分局，以代替以前在教育人民委员部下的档案总管理局。各加盟共和国也仿照俄罗斯联邦共和国成立了中央档案馆和中央档案管理局。为了反对阶级敌人潜入档案馆内销毁和贩卖有价值的文件，一九二二年六月九日全俄中央执行委员会主席团通过了“关于反对毁损档案文件”的通令，严禁把档案作为废纸出卖，违者给以法律制裁。
    在恢复国民经济时期，苏维埃国家的档案机关基本上完成了将革命前的档案文件集中到国家档案馆的工作。这样就在档案机关面前提出了如何集中革命后各苏维埃机关的档案问题。由于当时各机关的档案工作情况不很正规，中央档案馆在一九二五年初制定了“关于档案室接收和保管文书处理部门档案文件的制度”，其中详细规定了机关办公室应如何把文件移交给机关档案室，如何整理和保存档案室中的文件，档案室经过多少时候，并在什么情况下把文件送交国家档案馆。一九二五年的这个条例，后来曾加修改补充，它到现在仍是苏维埃各机关必须遵守的条例。
    当苏联进入社会主义工业化的时期，要求有很好的档案工作为国家经济建设服务。一九二六年二月全俄中央执行委员会通过了“关于整理一九一七——一九二一年的文件并将其移交档案馆的决议”。根据这一决议，中央机关、团体和企业应在指定期内将文件向国家中央档案馆移交；地方机关的文件，则向国家地方档案馆移交。同年二月，俄罗斯苏维埃联邦共和国人民委员会通过了“向国家档案馆移交照片、影片档案的法令”，这一法令规定：凡能反映社会现象和政治现象并具有革命历史意义的照片、影片，自产生之日起经过五年即向国家档案馆移交。这样就使得记录国家政治生活和社会生活的档案材料全面集中，而不仅限于书面文件。
    到社会主义工业化末期，中央和地方国家档案馆集中了不少机关、团体的档案文件，但对所收到的文件尚未进行整理。新的任务要求档案馆的工作更精确。一九二九年一月，苏联政府批准了“俄罗斯苏维埃联邦共和国档案管理局的条例”，这一条例确定了档案机关的任务和权利。条例规定一切机关、企业和团体的文件，从其产生之日算起，经过十年向国家档案馆移交，乡村苏维埃的文件，经三年移交，照片和影片经五年移交。如现行机关仍需用，可延期移交，但不得超过二十五年。条例中还规定了挑选需要保管和销毁的文件的制度，各机关根据文件保管期限一览表鉴定文件的保存或销毁，送交国家档案馆的文件都是需要永久保存的文件。
    一九二九年四月，苏联政府通过了“关于建立苏联中央档案管理局的决议”。成立苏联中央档案管理局，是为了领导各加盟共和国中央档案管理局，并管理具有全苏联意义的档案总体。一九二九年三月，联共（布）中央委员会批准了在列宁学院内成立党的中央档案馆的决议。在各共和国共产党中央、各边区及省的党委会下都建立党的地方档案馆，这些档案馆成为党中央档案馆的分馆，直接受列宁学院的领导。
    在实现农业集体化和改造国民经济一切部门的时期，苏维埃政府采取了一切办法来保存集体农庄、国营农场和农业机器站的文件，一九三三年十月全俄中央执行委员会通过了“关于整理集体农庄、国营农场和农业机器站档案的决议”。这个决议规定未经档案机关许可，绝对禁止销毁集体农庄、国营农场和农业机器站的任何文件，并责成集体农庄、国营农场和农业机器站选派专人负责保管档案。一九三四年十二月，苏维埃政府批准了“关于组织区档案馆的决议”，组织区档案馆是为了保护、收集和利用下层苏维埃机关、集体农庄、国营农场和农业机器站的文件。
    苏维埃政府为了培养档案干部，在一九三○年九月通过了关于成立档案学院的决议。一九三一年四月档案学院开课了，现在这个学院改称历史档案学院，它培养着熟练的档案工作干部。
    一九三一年八月，俄罗斯联邦共和国人民委员会公布了有关利用档案文件的专门决议，建议中央和地方机关，在制订建设草案或设备计划及进行地质勘探等各项工作之前，应向档案机关查询有关的档案文件，以便利用档案文件为社会主义建设服务，节省建设资金和人力。其它加盟共和国也公布了类似的决议。
    社会主义建设的日益胜利，科学和文化的繁荣，尤其是马克思主义历史课本的编写，都要求更彻底地改善档案馆和档案管理机关的工作。苏联中央执行委员会主席团于一九三五年六月二十七日通过了专门的决议，规定了整顿苏联档案工作的措施。一九三六年二月五日又通过了整顿苏联各人民委员部和中央机关档案工作的决议。这些决议规定从档案馆的设备、档案工作人员的训练，以及档案的保存销毁制度等方面进一步把档案工作健全起来，以便加速档案馆内文件的整理工作，使档案文件更好地为社会主义服务。
    一九三八年四月十六日，苏联最高苏维埃主席团颁布命令，把苏联中央档案管理局转归苏联内务部领导，以便进一步巩固中央和地方的档案建设工作。
    由于苏联共产党和政府在苏联档案建设中所实行的各种措施，在苏联建国的三十多年内，建立了全国统一的档案工作制度，建立了全国规模的国家档案管理机关和保存国家档案的档案馆网，现简单地叙述一下这些方面的情况：
    在苏联内务部内，设有中央档案管理局，在各加盟共和国、自治共和国、边区和省的内务部内也设有档案管理局。内务部中央档案管理局的任务是领导苏联国家内一切档案建设工作，它负责研究提出档案工作方面的命令、条例、指示草案，提请政府批准公布实行；领导中央和地方国家档案馆的工作；监督中央和地方机关、团体和企业档案室的工作；领导中央和地方机关档案材料的科学鉴定并批准不需要保存的文件的销毁等。地方档案管理局协助中央档案管理局领导本地区档案工作。档案管理局是档案行政机关，不是档案的保存机关。
    保存全国档案的机关是中央的（全苏的和各加盟共和国的）和地方的（自治共和国、边区、省、区）国家档案馆。全联盟的机关和团体的档案文件和具有全联盟意义的档案文件都保存在中央国家档案馆内，现在苏联共有八个中央国家档案馆，分别保存着古代的、革命前的和革命后的中央政权机关、社会团体、军队等组织的档案文件和具有全苏联意义的档案文件。除了全联盟意义的中央档案馆外，各加盟共和国还有自己的中央档案馆，保存着具有共和国意义的档案文件。每一自治共和国、边区、每一省内也设有自己的档案馆。各区则有区的档案馆，保存区村机关团体的文件。区档案馆的文件材料经十年向省国家档案馆移交。
    每个机关、团体都设有自己的档案室，各机关档案室受该机关负责人的直接领导，依照国家统一的档案整理和保存的制度进行工作。机关档案室经过一定期限向国家档案馆移交文件材料。
    苏联共产党的文件材料保存在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林学院直属的中央和各地党的档案馆里。在党的档案馆里也保存着列宁共产主义青年团的文件。
    苏联国家档案馆和科学研究机关、政府机关保持着密切联系，以使档案文件得以充分利用，为国家的政治、经济、文化建设和劳动人民的实际需要服务。国家档案馆经常按照专题把有用的文件材料查找出来供各机关应用，到一九三五年苏联档案机关共制成约八十万份专题卡片，为国家经济建设，为研究国内战争史、工厂史和党史提供了有价值的材料。又如从一九三五年到一九三七年，档案馆大约给劳动人民发出四十五万件查询证明，给苏维埃机关发出七千余件文件证明书。这三年中在国家档案馆阅览室内有一万三千个研究员进行了科学研究工作。此外档案机关还进行了许多公布文件的工作，例如出版了“十九世纪后五十年代革命运动文件汇集”、“一九○五年革命历史文件汇集”、“帝国主义时代的国际关系”、“十九世纪俄国的工人运动”、“德国法西斯强盗在哈尔科夫的残暴罪行”等等阐明历史和揭露敌人的文件汇集。这些工作表明档案馆不是积存废纸的仓库，而是配合国家建设的科学研究机关。目前苏联档案机关正配合着共产主义建设，进一步作好文件材料的整理工作。
    我们从苏联档案建设事业的历史中，可以学到什么呢？
    苏联是世界上第一个运用马克思列宁主义的观点正确地解决了利用档案材料来为全体劳动人民服务的国家，苏联档案建设的经验对我们是非常宝贵的。首先，苏联的档案建设经验告诉我们：国家的全部档案，必须归国家所有，并且必须集中保管和使用。只有工人农民掌握了政权以后的社会主义国家才真正关心劳动人民自己过去的成果，才能够真正地集中档案和正确地组织档案工作。我国是工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家，也完全有可能来这样做。所以全国的档案工作者应该很好地爱护我们所保管的各种档案，准备将来把它们集中统一地管理起来，供人民利用。
    其次，它告诉我们档案建设工作乃是全国规模的事务，不是各个机关内部的问题，所以档案工作，必须是全国统一的工作。在苏联是把档案材料作为全体人民的财富来处理的。档案材料不仅服务于机关的暂时需要，而且服务于全体人民的长远需要，因此就有全国统一的档案工作领导机关，有中央和地方的档案馆网，有全国统一的档案制度。但是要建立全国统一的档案制度和进行集中全国档案文件的措施，没有党和政府的关怀与指示是不可能的。这不仅因为有些机关有时从本机关的利益出发来考虑问题，而且在苏联档案建设的过程中曾有过激烈的阶级斗争。这是因为在档案工作方面隐藏了阶级敌人，他们企图分散、隐藏、损毁对全国人民极有价值的档案文件，他们想尽办法反对档案的集中，反对国家对档案的监督。所以在苏联档案建设中每一重要措施都有政府公布的命令，都有国家管理机关——档案管理局的监督，甚至有时还有国家司法保安机关的保护。我们机关工作人员都必须学习苏联的经验，在处理文书时就照顾长远的统一的档案工作，尤其是在收集与保管档案时，要加意爱护一切新旧档案，学习苏联整理与保管档案的方法，逐步建设起适合我国情况的档案工作制度，逐步走向全国档案工作的统一。
    第三，苏联档案建设能达成现在这样的规模，不仅是经过长期努力，而且是以革命的精神克服种种困难从事改革和建设的结果。苏联国家档案馆和档案机关的建立是从俄罗斯苏维埃联邦共和国开始逐渐发展到其它加盟共和国，然后才统一建立了全苏联的档案管理机关和全苏联的档案馆网。即使在国内战争的艰苦年代里，物质条件非常困难，仍然进行了档案建设工作，成立了档案总管理局进行集中革命前档案材料的工作。同时苏联共产党和政府又善于抓住每个时期档案建设的主要环节来从事工作，即首先建立了国家对档案事务的管理机关，以便全面统一地领导这一事业的进行；在革命后的一个时期先抓紧了抢救革命前机关档案文件的工作，同时又进行了收集军事档案的工作；到经济恢复时期基本上结束了历史档案的集中，这些都是当务之急。以后一个时期，就进行集中苏维埃机关的档案材料，但是，当时苏维埃机关的文书处理和档案工作还未完全走上正轨，集中起来的档案材料很混乱，于是国家乃颁布了统一的现行机关档案室工作条例。又如当进行农业的社会主义改造时，苏联政府鉴于农业社会主义改造的文件具有很大的科学和政治意义，乃采取措施进行收集整理这方面的档案，建立了区档案馆。这些有益的工作经验对我们都是可资借鉴的。我们今天来学习苏联档案工作历史，还可以也应该把某些改进档案工作的步骤加速进行。比如我们在收集和整理旧档案的同时，就可以运用苏联的经验，对新档案的集中做许多必要的准备工作，如健全机关文书处理和归档制度，改进文件材料的整理方法等。
    我国现正进行着有计划的经济建设和文化建设，档案工作的建立和健全，对于科学研究和经济建设工作以及对保守党和国家机密方面，都有它的积极作用。因此，学习苏联档案建设的先进经验，对于我国档案事业的顺利进行是有很重要的作用的。
