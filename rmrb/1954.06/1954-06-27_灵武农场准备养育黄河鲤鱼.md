Xinhua News Agency report:

    The state-owned Lingwu Mechanical Farm in Ningxia Province is actively preparing to raise fish. It plans to put 30,000 jin of Yellow River carp fry into the fish ponds in July of this year to begin raising them.
    The Lingwu Mechanical Farm is located on the east bank of the Yellow River and uses Yellow River water for irrigation. Every year, a large number of Yellow River carp fry flow into the farm's rice paddies along with the irrigation canal water. The Yellow River carp has delicious meat. This year, the farm has decided to catch the carp fry in the rice paddies and put them in fish ponds to raise. At present, the farm is surveying the fish pond site and has conducted preliminary investigations into fish feed and fish pond water temperature. Cadres specializing in fish farming are studying the freshwater fish farming experience of the Soviet Union and various parts of the country. Once these carp fry grow up, they will not only increase the farm's income, but also be available for urban and rural people to eat.

    灵武农场准备养育黄河鲤鱼
    宁夏省国营灵武机械农场积极准备养鱼。计划今年七月将三万斤黄河鲤鱼鱼苗放入鱼池开始养育。
    灵武机械农场在黄河东岸，引黄河水灌溉，每年有黄河鲤鱼鱼苗顺灌溉渠水大量流入农场稻田内，黄河鲤鱼肉味鲜美。今年，农场决定在稻田内捕捉鲤鱼鱼苗，放进鱼池饲养。目前这个农场正在勘查鱼池地址，对养鱼饲料和鱼池水温也进行了初步调查，养鱼的专职干部正在学习苏联和国内各地淡水区养鱼经验。这些鲤鱼鱼苗长成后，不但增加农场收入，而且可供应城乡人民食用。
