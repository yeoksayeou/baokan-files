Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 10th. The Chinese People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region completed its work of distributing interest-free agricultural loans on the Kangzang Plateau at the end of May. This year, the agricultural loan work teams arrived at the distribution points before the spring ploughing and sowing, enabling farmers in Tibet and western Xikang to receive timely assistance with interest-free agricultural loans. Many farmers have opened up new wasteland, expanded the planting area, and added agricultural tools and livestock. The agricultural loan work teams also distributed some improved crop seeds to farmers in some areas and introduced advanced farming methods. In Xiezong, downstream of the Lhasa River, the agricultural loan staff personally helped farmers trial-plant more than a dozen crops and vegetables. This Zong used to suffer from insect plagues frequently. The work team brought insecticides to help farmers kill insects and told them many scientific methods for preventing and controlling insect plagues.

    今年发放无息农贷工作结束
   【新华社拉萨十日电】中国人民解放军西藏军区今年在康藏高原发放无息农业贷款的工作，已在五月底结束。今年农贷工作队都在春耕播种前赶到发放地点，使西藏地区以及西康西部地区的农民及时得到无息农业贷款的帮助。不少农民新开了荒地，扩大了播种面积，添置了农具和牲口。农贷工作队还在部分地区向农民发了一些优良的作物种籽，介绍先进的耕作方法。在拉萨河下游的谢宗，农贷工作人员亲自帮助农民试种了十多种作物和蔬菜。这个宗过去经常发生虫灾，工作队带了杀虫药剂去帮助农民灭虫，并告诉他们许多防治虫灾的科学方法。
