    Subsidiary Occupations of Soviet Collective Farm Families
    Soviet Union, Ni Pulu-shakov
    That evening, the lights in the collective farm office were on late. The collective farm chairman Puyanov, agronomist Xibiliyev, accountant Xurqin, Party branch secretary Baxiaonok, and horticulturist Mulaxiyev were all engrossed in pleasant conversation. They were discussing the issue of the private plots of collective farm members.
    Collective farm chairman Puyanov said: "It should be said that this is our negligence, up to now, some collective farmers' homesteads have not carried out the cultivation of fruits and berries. Let's discuss this issue at the collective farm members' congress. We have our own nursery, the saplings are sufficient to expand the public orchard, and also sufficient to plant new orchards in the homesteads of the members. Only, we must hurry up and do this..."
    The general meeting of all members of the Ilich Collective Farm in the Lenin District of Moscow Oblast was held soon. The meeting decided to plant fruit trees in each member's homestead. For this purpose, the collective farm management was responsible for selecting 500 apple saplings, 1,000 cherry saplings, and countless red currant, gooseberry, raspberry seedlings, and strawberry runners from the collective farm nursery.
    The care for the common interests of the members and the combination of their personal interests is one of the important tasks of the collective farm management stipulated in the collective farm charter. The basic and decisive source of income for the wealthy life of Soviet farmers is their collective economy. This economy is based on advanced Soviet agricultural science and uses modern machinery, so the collective farm's public economy is always highly productive and highly profitable. The management of the members' personal homestead plots is of a subsidiary nature. This can serve as a supplementary source of supply for certain agricultural products for collective farm households, and can also meet the needs of collective farm households' individual tastes.
    Chairman Puyanov said: "Each household participating in our collective farm can keep a homestead plot of three-tenths of a hectare (approximately 4.5 *mu*), which they can manage themselves. Almost all collective farm members plant potatoes and vegetables on their homestead plots, and many people have small fruit and berry gardens near their houses. Flower beds are arranged under the windows. Most of the members also raise a cow, a few sheep, a few pigs, and all collective farmers raise many hens, geese, and ducks."
    In addition to engaging in collective labor in the collective farm, members are able to get the necessary time to take care of their subsidiary occupations. The collective farm management provides care and assistance to the members' subsidiary occupations. It supplies them with horses and farm tools needed to cultivate their homestead plots, and allocates timber and various building materials needed for repairing or building houses.
    It is of great significance for collective farmers to transport their products to the market for sale. Taking the example of female member Anna Puliuqin's family, in 1953, she and her two sisters did 1,400 workdays together. This family received more than 230 quintals of products from the collective farm -- grains, potatoes, vegetables, meat, and milk. In addition, their family also obtained a lot of products from their own homestead plots. In order to sell the surplus products, transporting them to the market or trading institutions requires a lot of manpower and tools.
    How is this problem solved in the collective farm?
    Puyanov told us: "The sale of collective farm members' products is carried out in an organized manner. For this purpose, the management allocates transportation tools such as cars and horse-drawn carts to the collective farmers. Some members go to the market themselves in order to sell their surplus products themselves. But many people ask the management to organize the collective sale of their own products. In this case, the management provides not only transportation tools, but also personnel to sell these goods. After the sale, the money earned is handed over to the members. Last autumn, the farm sold 450 tons of potatoes and 350 tons of vegetables in this way. The surplus milk throughout the year is also sold in this way. We have been implementing this method of selling products for many years, and it is beneficial to the collective farmers, saving them a lot of manpower and time, so the members like this method."
    Puyanov introduced us to the collective farm's horticulturist Ivan Mulaxiyev. He said: "If you have the opportunity, you can take a look at his subsidiary occupation, his subsidiary occupation is a typical one among our members."
    One Sunday evening, we visited Mulaxiyev's home. His residence is a one-story wooden house, surrounded by a wide small garden. Behind the house is a neat vegetable garden. The entire house is divided into three spacious rooms, all furnished with good furniture: a mirrored wardrobe, a brightly polished china cabinet, soft sofas, large mirrors, nickel-plated beds, wall carpets, and soft rugs on the floor -- all of which illustrate the prosperity of the Mulaxiyev family life, and illustrate that the master and mistress are good at managing the housework.
    The mistress -- Natalia Temiteilifuna and their seven-year-old daughter Lida were sitting at the table, watching the song and dance program broadcast by the Moscow Central Television Station with great interest on television.
    Our conversation quickly turned to the role played by the personal subsidiary occupations of collective farm members.
    The host said: "Of course, the main source of income for our family, like other families, relies on the public economy of the collective farm. In 1953, we did 850 workdays in the collective farm and received 5,850 kilograms of potatoes, 850 kilograms of grain, 6,800 kilograms of vegetables, 425 liters of milk, a lot of meat and other products. In this way, we received a total of more than 13 and a half tons of things. Most of the things we sold to the market or state institutions. The total income received was more than 10,000 rubles. In addition, we received another 3,400 rubles in cash income from the collective farm. Added together, this is a very good income. The family life can indeed be very prosperous."
    As for what can the Mulaxiyev family get from their subsidiary occupations?
    The host said: "Regarding this aspect of things, our mistress probably knows more clearly than I do."
    So, Natalia Temiteilifuna smiled and introduced me to their family's subsidiary occupations. She said that they have a special interest in fruit growing. Every year, the two of them always try to plant something near the house. Now, almost half of the homestead plot is used to cultivate fruits and berries. They have planted a total of 43 apple trees, 30 cherry trees, 54 gooseberry and red currant trees, and several thousand strawberry plants. For a family, so many fruits and berries are more than enough. Therefore, part of the harvest is taken out for sale. For example, last year they sold 400 kilograms of apples and berries. Temiteilifuna said that because they have their own orchard, even in the winter season, there is no shortage of fresh apples and candied fruit made with fresh fruits and berries on their table. And when drinking tea, they always add a little syrup made from fresh berries themselves.
    On the Mulaxiyev's homestead plot, 0.13 hectares (nearly 2 *mu*) of potatoes are also planted. Last year, they harvested so many potatoes that they almost had enough for their family to eat for the whole year. Therefore, most of the potatoes they received from the collective farm were taken to the market for sale.
    They have a cow, fifteen hens, and also raise piglets; when a piglet is slaughtered, another piglet is bought and raised at the same time. So they don't lack meat, they don't lack milk, they don't lack eggs -- they don't lack anything in terms of food.
    In winter, the cow produces 20 liters of milk a day. And their family only needs two to three liters a day for eating and drinking, the remaining milk is partly taken out for sale, and partly used to make cream, sour cream, butter and cottage cheese.
    Finally, we asked Natalia Temiteilifuna to talk about how their family allocates their income. Here is her answer:
      "We live within our means, we eat very well, we are not stingy in this regard. In addition, we often add some furniture and clothes. This is the TV we bought last year, the mirrored cabinet, and the accordion we bought for our son Nikolai, who is currently serving in the Soviet army. At that time, he finished his electrical engineering school, and we gave him this gift as a reward for passing the exam. He is the best accordion player in our family."
    "My husband also gave me this pretty good gift not long ago," the mistress said happily, pointing to her gold watch.
    Natalia Temiteilifuna continued: "Last autumn, our daughter Lida also went to school, and we bought her a fur coat, clothes and outerwear. You know, all the children in our village are dressed very well. Now is not the time when we were children ourselves, how hard life was at that time, we couldn't even eat enough bread, where would we dream of what suitable and beautiful clothes!"
    When the Mulaxiyev couple talked about their lives, they were full of gratitude and pride for their collective farm and the Soviet regime.
    Their family's cultural life is also very rich. They often take the bus to the major theaters in Moscow to see plays. They have been to the Vakhtangov Theater to see "The White-Haired Girl." They also went to the Grand Theater to see the opera "Ivan Susanin." They often watch movies at the collective farm's club, and almost every day they take some time to watch various programs broadcast from Moscow on their own TV at home.
    Mulaxiyev also likes to read literary works. The club's large library is their regular haunt. Daily newspapers and periodicals are their spiritual food. Their family subscribes to two magazines -- "Orchard and Vegetable Garden" and "Moscow Collective Farmer."
    Ordinary Soviet collective farmers' families live such a prosperous and simple life.

    苏联集体农民家庭的副业
    苏联  尼·普鲁沙可夫
    这天晚上，集体农庄办事处里的灯火很晚还没有熄。农庄主席蒲扬诺夫、农艺师希比里也夫、会计师许尔琴、党组织书记巴萧诺克和园艺师牟拉希也夫这时都沉醉在愉快的谈话中了。他们所谈的是关于集体农庄庄员的宅旁园地的问题。
    集体农庄主席蒲扬诺夫说道：“这应该说是我们的疏忽大意，到现在为止某些集体农民们的宅旁还没有进行水果和浆果的培植。让我们在集体农庄庄员大会上讨论这个问题吧。我们有自己的苗圃，树秧是足够扩充公有果园用的，也足够在庄员们的宅旁园地上栽植新的果园。只是必须赶紧办这件事情……。”
    莫斯科州列宁区伊里奇集体农庄的全体庄员大会很快就举行了。大会决定要在每个庄员的宅旁栽植果木。为了这个目的，集体农庄管理处负责从集体农庄苗圃里选出五百棵苹果树苗，一千棵樱桃树苗，无数棵的红醋栗、醋栗、覆盆子苗和草莓秧。
    对庄员们公共利益和他们私人利益相结合的关心，是集体农庄章程所规定的集体农庄管理处的重大任务之一。苏联农民富裕生活的基本的、而具有决定性的收入来源，就是他们的集体经济。这种经济是建立在先进的苏维埃农业科学基础上并使用现代化的机器的，因此集体农庄的公有经济永远是具有高度生产率和高度收益的。庄员个人宅旁园地的经营是带有副业性质的。这可以作为集体农户某些农产品供应上的补充来源，并且也能够满足集体农户个人口味的需要。
    蒲扬诺夫主席说道：“每个参加我们集体农庄的农户，可以保持十分之三公顷（约四点五市亩半）大小的宅旁园地，由自己处理。差不多所有的集体农庄庄员们都在自己的宅旁园地上栽种马铃薯、蔬菜，许多人的房子附近还有不大的水果、浆果园。窗下布置着花坛。大多数的庄员自己还养一头奶牛、几只羊、几只猪，而所有的集体农民们都饲养着许多母鸡、鹅和鸭。”
    在从事集体农庄的集体劳动之外，庄员们是能够得到必要的时间来照料自己的副业的。集体农庄管理处对庄员们的副业予以关心和帮助。它供给他们耕种宅旁园地所需用的马和农具，拨付修理或建筑房屋等所需用的木材和各种建筑材料。
    把庄员的生产品运送到市场上去出售，这对集体农民们是有很大意义的。以女庄员安娜·浦留琴家的例子来讲，在一九五三年她和两个姊妹一块儿做了一千四百个劳动日。这一家从集体农庄里得到了二百三十公担以上的产品——谷类、马铃薯、蔬菜、肉类和牛奶。此外，她们一家还从自己的宅旁园地上得到了不少的产品。为了销售剩余的产品，把它们运送到市场上或者贸易机构里去，是需要许多人力和工具的。
    这个问题在集体农庄里究竟是怎样解决的呢？
    蒲扬诺夫告诉我们说：“销售集体庄员们的产品是有组织地进行的。管理处为了这个目的把汽车和马车等运输工具拨借给集体农民们。有些庄员们自己动身到市场上去，为的是由自己来出售他们的剩余产品。但很多人则请求管理处把属于他们自己的产品组织集体出售。在这种情况下，管理处所提供的不仅是运输工具，而且还有出售这些商品的人员。在出售以后，就把售得的货币交给庄员。去年秋天农庄就用这样的方法售出了四百五十吨马铃薯和三百五十吨蔬菜。全年都有剩余的牛奶，也是这样销售掉的。我们实行这种销售产品的办法已有好多年了，它对集体农民们是有好处的，可以节省他们不少的人力和时间，所以庄员们都喜欢这种办法。”
    蒲扬诺夫向我们介绍了集体农庄的园艺师伊凡·牟拉希也夫。他说：“有机会可以去瞧一瞧他的副业，他的副业在我们的庄员中间是一个典型。”
    在一个星期天的晚上，我们到牟拉希也夫的家作了访问。他的住宅是一层楼的木制房屋，住宅四周围着宽广的小花园。屋子后面是整洁的菜园。整个房屋分成为三个宽敞的房间，都陈设着很好的家具：带镜的衣橱、擦得晶亮的器皿柜、软沙发、大镜子、镀镍的床、墙毯和地板上的软路毯——所有这些都说明了牟拉希也夫家庭生活的富裕，说明了主人和主妇是善于料理家务的。
    女主人——娜塔莉·特米特里芙娜和他们七岁的女儿莉达坐在桌子旁边，津津有味地在电视机上瞧着莫斯科中央电视站所播送的歌舞节目。
    我们的谈话很快就转到了关于集体庄员个人副业所起的作用的问题上。
    主人说：“当然，我们家庭收入的主要来源，如同其他家庭一样，是依靠集体农庄的公有经济的。一九五三年，我们在集体农庄里做了八百五十个工作日，得到了五千八百五十公斤马铃薯，八百五十公斤谷物，六千八百公斤蔬菜，四百二十五公升牛奶，不少的肉类和其他的产品。这样一来，我们一共得到了十三吨半多的东西。大部分东西我们都出售给市场或国家的机构了。总共得到的收入是一万多个卢布。除此以外，我们从集体农庄里又得到了三千四百个卢布的现金收入。加在一起，这是
  一笔很不错的收入。家里的生活的确可以过得很富裕了。”
    至于牟拉希也夫一家在副业上究竟能得到些什么呢？
    主人说：“关于这方面的事情，我们的女主人大概知道得比我更清楚些。”
    于是，娜塔莉·特米特里芙娜微笑地向我介绍起她们家庭的副业来了。她说，她们对于果艺有特别的兴趣。每年她们两口子总要在屋子近旁设法种上些什么。现在差不多有一半的宅旁园地用来培植水果和浆果。他们一共种了四十三棵苹果树、三十棵樱桃树、五十四棵醋栗树和红醋栗树，好几千棵草莓。对于一个家庭说来，这么多的水果和浆果是绰绰有余的。因此一部分的收成就拿来出售。例如去年他们就出售了四百公斤的苹果和浆果。特米特里芙娜说，因为有了自己的果园，就是在冬天的季节里，他们餐桌上也断不了新鲜的苹果和用新鲜水果与浆果制成的蜜饯。而且在喝茶的时候总要加点儿自己用新鲜浆果做成的糖浆。
    在牟拉希也夫宅旁园地上还种着零点一三公顷（近二市亩）的马铃薯。去年他们收的马铃薯多得差不多够他们一家全年吃的。因此他们从集体农庄分得的马铃薯大部分都拿到市场上去出售了。
    他们有一头奶牛、十五只母鸡，并且还喂养着小猪；当宰掉一只小猪的时候，就同时买进另外一只小猪来喂养。所以他们肉也不缺、牛奶也不缺，鸡蛋也不缺——吃的方面什么都短不了。
    在冬天的时候，奶牛每天出二十公升的奶。而他们一家吃喝用的每天只要二——三公升就行了，余下的牛奶一部分拿去出售，一部分就用来做乳脂、酸乳油、黄油和奶渣。
    最后，我们要求娜塔莉·特米特里芙娜讲一下他们家里是怎样分配自己的收入的。下面是她的回答：
      “我们是量入为出的，我们吃得很好，在这方面是毫不吝啬的。此外还常常添置一些家具和衣服。这就是我们在去年买的电视机，带镜的柜子，还有给目前正在苏联军队中服役的儿子尼古拉买的手风琴。当时他念完了电工专科学校，我们把这个礼物给他，作为考试及格的奖品。他是我们家里手风琴拉得最好的一个。”
    “我的丈夫不久以前也送了我这个挺不错的礼物”，女主人指着自己的金手表很高兴地说。
    娜塔莉·特米特里芙娜继续说：“去年秋天我们的女儿莉达也上学了，我们替她买了皮袄、衣服和外衣。要知道我们乡里所有的孩子都是穿得很好的。现在已不是从前我们自己当孩子的时候了，那时候过的生活是多苦啊，就连面包也吃不饱，哪里还会去梦想什么合身的漂亮的衣服呢！”
    牟拉希也夫夫妇俩在讲述自己的生活时，充满着对自己的集体农庄，对苏维埃政权的感谢和自豪的感觉。
    他们家里的文化生活也是很丰富的。他们坐车到莫斯科各大戏院去看戏是常有的事情。他们曾到瓦赫坦戈夫剧院去看过“白毛女”。还去大剧院看过歌剧“伊凡·苏沙宁”。他们常常在集体农庄的俱乐部里看电影，而且差不多每天总要抽出些时间来在自己家里的电视机上瞧瞧从莫斯科播送出来的各种节目。
    牟拉希也夫也喜欢读文学作品。俱乐部的大图书馆是他们经常的去处。每天出版的报纸和定期刊物更是他们的精神食粮。他们一家就订有两种杂志——“果园和菜园”和“莫斯科集体农民”。
    普通的苏联集体农民的家庭，就过着这样富裕的、朴实的生活。
