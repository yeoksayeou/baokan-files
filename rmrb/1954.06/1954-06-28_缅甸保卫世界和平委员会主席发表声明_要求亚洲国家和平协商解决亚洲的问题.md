Xinhua News Agency, June 27th, Rangoon: Chairman of the Burma Peace Committee, Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, issued a statement on the 23rd, calling on the people of Asia, especially the people of Burma, to vigorously oppose the US plan to cobble together a Southeast Asian military bloc, and to urge Asian countries to reach a consensus on resolving inter-state relations based on the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.

The statement said that the people of Asia do not want a new world war. They want world peace and Asian peace.

They have seen that after World War II, the Korean War broke out; the flames of war ignited in Indochina; and some groups are still trying to extend this massacre to the whole of Asia.

They also know that Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines have become foreign military bases; now some people are looking for new military bases in Pakistan; and Kuomintang elements are again invading Burma. All this runs counter to the Asian people's desire for peace and security.

The statement said that threats to peace and security have emerged immediately after the release of the South Asian Prime Ministers' communiqué. This threat arises from the US government's attempt to establish a so-called defense organization in Southeast Asia.

What kind of government is the US government trying to establish this organization? It is precisely such a government that dropped atomic bombs on Japan during World War II; its army crossed the Pacific to launch aggression and start the Korean War; it used inhumane weapons of mass destruction in the Korean War; and now it is trying to expand the Indochina War; it has established many military bases in the Asian region and is now trying to establish new military bases; it has instigated and supported the Kuomintang invaders in Burma and provided them with assistance.

The "Southeast Asia Defense Organization" being established by the US government only serves the purposes of US aggressive forces and only helps to strengthen and expand its aggression bases and wars.

On the other hand, the people of Asia see that peace-loving Asian countries are striving to fulfill the task of maintaining world peace. For example, recently, the People's Republic of China and India concluded an agreement on trade and transportation between the Tibet region of China and India. The preamble to this agreement states that the relations between the two governments will be based on the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.

These principles ensure that there will be no war between the People's Republic of China and India. This relationship between the two major Asian countries will become a pillar of peace in Asia.

The statement accused the United States of using all conspiracies to undermine the Geneva Conference and instigate new wars to invade Asia.

The statement said that the successive speeches by Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, at the Geneva Conference have fully demonstrated the urgent desire of the Asian people for peace, hoping that Asian countries will sign trade and friendship agreements, develop cultural exchanges, and strengthen unity to maintain overall peace in Asia, so as to prevent imperialism from launching a new war in Asia.

The statement finally called on the people of Asia, especially the people of Burma, to vigorously oppose the US plan to cobble together military blocs, and to urge Asian countries to reach a consensus on resolving inter-state relations based on the principles included in the Sino-Indian agreement on trade and transportation between the Tibet region of China and India.

    缅甸保卫世界和平委员会主席发表声明
    要求亚洲国家和平协商解决亚洲的问题
    【新华社二十七日讯】仰光消息：缅甸保卫世界和平委员会主席德钦哥都迈二十三日发表声明，要求亚洲人民特别是缅甸人民竭力反对美国拼凑东南亚军事集团的计划，并促使亚洲国家取得一致的意见，根据互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互惠、和平共处的原则来解决亚洲国家之间的彼此关系的问题。
    声明中说，亚洲人民不要新的世界战争。他们要世界的和平，要亚洲的和平。
    他们看到，在第二次世界大战后爆发了朝鲜战争；燃起了印度支那战火；有某些集团还想把这种大屠杀扩展到整个亚洲。
    他们还知道，日本、台湾和菲律宾变成了外国的军事基地；现在又有人在巴基斯坦找寻新的军事基地；国民党分子又在侵入缅甸。这一切都是和亚洲人民要和平与安全的愿望背道而驰的。
    声明说，南亚总理会议的公报刚刚发表，就又出现了对和平与安全的威胁。这一威胁产生于美国政府要在东南亚建立所谓防御组织的企图。
    力图建立这个组织的美国政府是怎样一个政府呢？它正是这样一个政府，它在第二次世界大战期间曾向日本投掷过原子弹；它的军队曾横渡太平洋发动侵略，开始朝鲜战争；它曾在朝鲜战争中使用不人道的大规模毁灭性武器；现在它正企图扩大印度支那战争；它曾经在亚洲地区建立了许多军事基地，现在正企图建立新的军事基地；它曾经鼓动和维护在缅甸的国民党侵略者，并给他们以援助。
    美国政府正在建立的“东南亚防务组织”只是为美国侵略势力的目的服务，只是有助于加强和扩大它的侵略基地和战争。
    而在另一方面，亚洲人民看到，爱好和平的亚洲国家正竭力实现维护世界和平的任务。例如，不久前，中华人民共和国和印度缔结了关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定。这个协定的序言指出，两国政府的关系将是建立在互相尊重领土的完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互惠、和平共处这些原则之上。
    这些原则使中华人民共和国和印度之间不会有战争。两个亚洲大国之间的这种关系将成为亚洲和平的支柱。
    声明指责美国施用一切阴谋破坏日内瓦会议和挑动新战争以侵略亚洲。
    声明中说，中华人民共和国中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来在日内瓦会议上的历次发言，已充分显示了亚洲人民要求和平的迫切愿望，希望亚洲各国之间签订贸易和友好协定，发展文化交流，加强团结以维护亚洲的全面和平，以制止帝国主义在亚洲发动新战争。
    声明最后呼吁亚洲人民，特别是缅甸人民竭力反对美国拼凑军事集团的计划，并促使亚洲国家取得一致的意见，根据中印两国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定所包括的原则，来解决亚洲国家之间的彼此关系的问题。
