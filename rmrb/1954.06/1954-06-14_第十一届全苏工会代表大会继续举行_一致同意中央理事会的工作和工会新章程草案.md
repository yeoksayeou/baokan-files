Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The 11th All-Union Congress of Trade Unions continued its sessions on the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th of June in the Moscow Kremlin.

The meetings on the 9th and 10th continued the discussion of the summary reports of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and the Central Auditing Commission, and heard the report of the Credentials Committee.

Khojayev, Chairman of the Trade Union Council of the Uzbek Republic, and Belsky, Chairman of the Trade Union Council of the Belorussian Republic, spoke at the meeting, respectively, about the great achievements of economic and cultural construction in the Uzbek Republic and the Belorussian Republic. Kozlov, Director of the Central Administration of Sanatoriums, Rest Homes and Resorts of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, used specific examples in his speech to illustrate the development of the Soviet workers' welfare undertakings. Irina, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Medical Workers' Union of the Soviet Union, used specific examples in her speech to prove the great care of the Communist Party and the Soviet state for the health of the working people.

Zhinov, Chairman of the Credentials Committee of the Congress, gave a report on the results of the credentials review of the Congress delegates. He said that a total of 1,364 delegates attended the Congress, representing 40,400,000 trade union members of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. Among the delegates were more than 50 Heroes of Socialist Labor and Heroes of the Soviet Union, 75 Stalin Prize winners, 175 deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and deputies to the Supreme Soviets of the various Union Republics.

The meeting on the 11th concluded the discussion of the summary reports of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and the Central Auditing Commission, and heard and discussed the report on the revision of the All-Union Trade Union Charter.

At the end of the discussion, Shvernik, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, made a concluding speech. He said that the delegates who spoke at the Congress justly criticized the work of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and its various departments. The central committees of various trade unions and their local organizations should pay more attention to wage issues and labor quota issues in the future, so that trade union organizations at all levels pay attention to strengthening the role of wages in improving labor productivity, improving product quality, and reducing production costs. Trade union organizations must also be more concerned about improving the technical and cultural level of young workers.

The Congress unanimously approved the work of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and elected a committee to draft a resolution on the summary reports.

Next, Popova, Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, made a report on the third item on the agenda, regarding the revision of the All-Union Trade Union Charter. Popova said that the current All-Union Trade Union Charter was adopted more than five years ago, and this charter can no longer fully reflect the new circumstances that have occurred in the actual work of the trade unions in recent years, nor can it adapt to the increasingly heavy tasks of the trade unions.

Popova then spoke in detail about the various chapters in the charter that need to be revised. She pointed out that the draft of the new charter supplements the articles on trade unions implementing the policies and decrees of the Party and the government and actively participating in construction work, and more fully clarifies the tasks of trade unions in organizing socialist emulation, opposing bureaucracy, and launching criticism, etc. For all trade union organizations, the revised charter is a sharper weapon, and with its help, the trade unions will continue to fulfill their responsibilities with greater energy, as well as the glorious mission of educating and organizing the masses.

The Congress then began to discuss the draft of the All-Union Trade Union Charter.

The meeting on the 12th concluded the discussion of the report on the revision of the All-Union Trade Union Charter.

The delegates who spoke at the meeting all agreed with the draft of the new trade union charter, and put forward a number of amendments and supplements to the various details. They emphasized that the draft of the new charter truly reflects the role of trade union organizations in developing the national economy, guiding socialist emulation, and solving problems aimed at meeting the material and cultural needs of the working people. It will help the trade unions to better accomplish the tasks of educating and organizing the masses of workers.

G. Alexandrov, Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union, spoke at the meeting. He said that the reports and speeches at the Congress clearly illustrated the great tasks now facing the Soviet trade unions. These tasks not only involve economic issues, but also involve the further development of the Soviet social culture. Alexandrov spoke in detail about the enormous scale of construction of Soviet cultural organs. He then said that one of the very important tasks facing entertainment organizations and trade union organizations is to better serve the workers of machine tractor stations and state farms in terms of entertainment. A large number of film equipment and films, political and agricultural books, magazines and newspapers have been sent to those areas that are reclaiming wasteland, and measures are being taken to supply all machine tractor stations and residential areas in these areas with radio receivers in the short term.

At the meetings from the 9th to the 12th, many foreign trade union representatives addressed the Congress with congratulatory messages. They expressed friendly wishes to the Soviet working class on behalf of the working class of their own countries, and talked about the situation of the workers' movement in their own countries and the determination to strengthen the solidarity of the international working class. In addition, the Congress also received congratulatory telegrams from trade unions and workers' organizations in many countries.

    第十一届全苏工会代表大会继续举行
    一致同意中央理事会的工作和工会新章程草案
    据新华社讯：第十一届全苏工会代表大会九日、十日、十一日和十二日在莫斯科克里姆林宫继续开会。
    九日和十日的会议继续讨论全苏工会中央理事会和中央检查委员会的总结报告，并听取了资格审查委员会的报告。
    乌兹别克共和国工会理事会主席霍雅耶夫和白俄罗斯共和国工会理事会主席别尔斯基在会上分别谈述了乌兹别克共和国和白俄罗斯共和国的经济和文化建设的巨大成就。全苏工会中央理事会休养地、疗养院和休养所中央管理局局长科兹洛夫，在发言时用具体事例说明了苏联工人福利事业的发展情况。苏联医务工作者工会中央委员会主席伊林娜在发言时，用具体的事例证明共产党和苏维埃国家对劳动人民的健康的极大关怀。
    大会资格审查委员会主席日诺夫在会上作了大会代表资格审查结果的报告。他说，出席代表大会的共有一千三百六十四个代表，代表着苏联各民族四千零四十万工会会员。代表中有五十多个社会主义劳动英雄和苏联英雄，七十五个斯大林奖金得奖人，一百七十五个苏联最高苏维埃代表和各加盟共和国最高苏维埃代表。
      十一日会议结束了对全苏工会中央理事会和中央检查委员会的总结报告的讨论，听取并讨论了关于修改全苏工会章程的报告。
    讨论结束时，全苏工会中央理事会主席什维尔尼克作了总结发言。他说，在代表大会上发言的代表们公正地批评了全苏工会中央理事会和它的各部的工作。各工会中央委员会和它的地方组织今后应当更加注意工资问题和劳动定额问题，使各级工会组织注意加强工资在提高劳动生产率、改进产品质量和降低生产成本中的作用。工会组织还必须更加关心青年工人的技术和文化水平的提高。
    代表大会一致同意全苏工会中央理事会的工作，并选出了就总结报告草拟决议案的委员会。
    接着，全苏工会中央理事会书记波波娃就第三项议程作了关于修改全苏工会章程的报告。波波娃说，现行的全苏工会章程是五年多以前通过的，这一章程已不能充分反映近年来工会在实际工作中发生的新的情况，也不能适应工会的日益加重了的任务。
    波波娃接着详细谈到章程中需要修改的各章。她指出：在新章程草案中补充了关于工会执行党和政府的政策法令、积极参加建设工作的条文，更详尽地阐明了工会在组织社会主义竞赛、反对官僚主义、展开批评方面的任务等。对各工会组织来讲，修改过的章程是一个更锐利的武器，各工会在它的帮助下将以更大的精力继续实现自己的责任，以及教育和组织群众这一光荣的使命。
    代表大会接着开始讨论全苏工会章程草案。
    十二日会议结束了关于修改全苏工会章程的报告的讨论。
    在会上发言的代表都同意工会新章程草案，并对其中的各项细节提出了若干修正和补充。他们着重指出，新章程草案真实地反映了工会组织在发展国民经济、指导社会主义竞赛及解决旨在满足劳动人民物质和文化需要的问题等方面的作用。它将帮助工会更好地完成教育和组织工人群众的任务。
    苏联文化部部长格·亚历山德罗夫在会上讲话。他说，代表大会上的报告和发言清楚地说明了苏联工会现在所面临的伟大任务。这些任务不仅涉及经济问题，而且也涉及进一步发展苏维埃社会文化的问题。亚历山德罗夫详细地谈到了苏联文化机关建设的庞大规模。接着他说，文娱组织和工会组织所面临的非常重要的任务之一；就是在文娱方面更好地为机器拖拉机站及国营农场的工人服务。已经把大量的电影设备和影片、政治和农业书籍、杂志和报纸等送到那些正在开垦荒地的地区，并且正在采取措施要在短期内以无线电收音机供给这些地区的一切机器拖拉机站和住宅区。
    在九日到十二日的会议上，有许多外国的工会代表向大会致贺词。他们代表本国工人阶级向苏联工人阶级表示友好的愿望，并谈到了本国工人运动的情况和加强国际工人阶级团结的决心。此外，大会还收到很多国家的工会和工人组织的贺电。
