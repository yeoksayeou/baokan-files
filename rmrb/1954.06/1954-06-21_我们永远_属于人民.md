We Will Always "Belong to the People"
Chang Qing, Special Class Merit Citation Recipient, North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

The Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, a draft constitution that wholly belongs to the people, has been promulgated. I enthusiastically support it and will resolutely defend it!

The preamble to the Draft Constitution states, "The people's democratic system of the People's Republic of China, that is, the New Democratic system, guarantees that our country can eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means and build a prosperous and happy socialist society." The blood of countless revolutionary martyrs like Li Dazhao, Qu Qiubai, Fang Zhimin, Liu Hulan, Dong Cunrui, and Huang Jiguang has not been shed in vain. Their ideals have been realized and written into the Draft Constitution, fixing them in the form of law. "Exploitation and poverty," the shackles that have weighed upon the laboring people for thousands of years, are now legally slated for gradual elimination. "Socialist society," this happy paradise, attracts the hearts of millions like a magnet!

"Exploitation and poverty" will be like flowing water, burnt ashes, never to return. Future generations will not know what "exploitation and poverty" are. Sacred Constitution, you are our victory, our happiness, our ideal. You will make us young people more enthusiastic, braver, and wiser!

As a revolutionary soldier, I further recognize the responsibilities stipulated for us in the Draft Constitution. We will always "belong to the people," "defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and safeguard the security of the country and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty." (Article 20 of the Draft Constitution). I am proud of the responsibilities given to us by the people. I am a cultural and educational worker in the People's Liberation Army, and I clearly know that cultural and educational work in the People's Liberation Army directly serves the great warriors who defend the motherland. An artillery hero, after learning to read and write, said, "In the past, fighting was based solely on experience; now, fighting is based on science. With cultural and scientific knowledge, I am more confident that every shell will accurately explode over the enemy's head."

What this artillery hero said is true. In our motherland's skies, seas, and borders, there are People's Liberation Army forces who have mastered modern military technology, and they are protecting the socialist construction of the motherland. People of the motherland, build with confidence and bravely advance toward socialism! We will not hesitate to use our blood and lives to fulfill the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Draft Constitution!

My comrades and I are also very grateful for the honor given to us soldiers in the Draft Constitution. It bestows the only two instances of the word "glorious," one to laborers (Article 16 of the Draft Constitution) and one to those who "serve in the military" (Article 103 of the Draft Constitution). We pledge to the Party, to Chairman Mao, and to the people of the whole country that we will certainly be a "glorious" soldier serving socialism. I myself, in the past, have received today's honor thanks to the education of the Party and the help of my comrades. In the future, I will definitely study revolutionary theory a hundred times more diligently, study the spirit of the Draft Constitution, delve into my profession, and strive for greater achievements in my work.

    我们永远“属于人民”
    中国人民解放军华北军区特等功臣 常青
    中华人民共和国宪法草案，一个完全属于人民的宪法草案公布了。我热烈拥护它，还要坚决保卫它！
    宪法草案的序言里写着“中华人民共和国的人民民主制度，也就是新民主主义制度，保证我国能够通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。”李大钊、瞿秋白、方志敏、刘胡兰、董存瑞和黄继光等等无数革命先烈的血没有白流，他们的理想已经实现了，并且把它写在宪法草案上，用立法的形式把它固定了下来。“剥削和贫困”，这几千年来压在劳动人民身上的枷锁，法律上也定下来要把它逐步消灭掉，“社会主义社会”这个幸福的乐园，像吸铁石一样，吸住了千万人的心！
  “剥削和贫困”，将像流过的水，烧过的灰，一去不复返了；而未来的人们将不知道什么是“剥削和贫困”。神圣的宪法，你是我们的胜利，我们的幸福，我们的理想，你将使我们年青人变得更热情，更勇敢，更有智慧！
    作为革命军人，我更认识到宪法草案中，给我们规定的职责。我们将永远“属于人民”，“保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的安全和领土主权的完整。”（宪法草案第二十条）我为人民给予我们的职责而骄傲。我是解放军中的文化教育工作者，我清楚地知道，人民解放军中的文化教育工作是直接为保卫祖国的伟大战士服务的。一个炮兵英雄在学了文化以后，说：“过去打仗是光凭经验，现在打仗是凭科学。有了文化科学知识，我就更有把握让每一发炮弹，准确地在敌人头上开花。”
    这位炮兵英雄的话是真的，在我们祖国的天空、海洋、边疆都有这样掌握了现代化军事技术的人民军队，他们保卫着祖国的社会主义建设。祖国的人民，放心地建设，奋勇地向社会主义前进吧！我们不惜用鲜血和生命，来完成宪法草案给我们规定的光荣任务！
    我和我的战友们，还十分感谢宪法草案中给予我们军人的荣誉，它把仅有的两个“光荣”的字眼，一个赋予劳动者（宪法草案第十六条），一个赋予“服兵役”的人（宪法草案第一百零三条），我们向党，向毛主席，向全国人民保证：一定要作
  一个“光荣”的为社会主义服务的军人。我自己，在过去由于党的教育和同志们的帮助，才得到了今天的荣誉。今后，我一定百倍努力地学习革命理论，学习宪法草案的精神，钻研业务，求得工作上更大的成绩。
