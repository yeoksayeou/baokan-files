Doing a Good Job in the Allocation of Construction Workers to Serve National Basic Construction
(I)
Deputy Minister of Labor of the Central People's Government Mao Qihua

    The general task of the state during the transition period and the basic tasks of the first Five-Year Plan have placed new demands and tasks on the allocation of construction workers. This is to gradually achieve the planned and organized supply of labor needed for basic construction, assist construction enterprises in improving labor organization, and ensure the victorious completion of national basic construction tasks. To meet this need, by the end of 1953, the number of cities with construction worker allocation agencies nationwide had increased to ninety-three, and two large administrative regions, five provinces, and nineteen cities had promulgated construction worker allocation measures, thus enabling the work to be further developed.
    In 1953, labor administrative departments at all levels initially established a unified allocation system for construction workers, criticized the blind recruitment and poaching of workers by some state-owned construction units, restricted the illegal poaching of workers by private construction firms that disregarded national laws and regulations, and gradually reduced the chaotic phenomenon of farmers blindly flowing into cities; assisted construction units in adjusting labor, strengthened the planning of labor use, formulated technical standards, stipulated and promoted labor quotas, thereby improving labor productivity, and also played a certain role in improving enterprise management; basically overcame the phenomenon of blind mobility of construction workers, and currently, not only fixed workers but also temporary and seasonal workers are recruited under a certain system.
    Many local labor administrative departments have also assisted construction units in fixing construction workers, winter training, and consolidating teams, improving the political, technical, and cultural level of workers, and making the construction teams increasingly pure.
      (II)
    Although the allocation of construction workers has achieved certain results in the past, there are still many problems:
    First of all, the labor administrative departments do not have a clear understanding of the task of serving basic construction through allocation work. Some places initially carried out allocation work for the employment of unemployed people, introducing some inappropriate personnel to construction units, even some old, weak, sick, and disabled people, which affected production. Some places adopted the so-called good-and-bad matching method when introducing workers to construction units. Some places regarded the allocation of construction workers as a temporary job, thinking that once the construction workers were fixed, there would be nothing to do. Some places do not see the new needs of the construction period, and the work is still stuck in the stage of issuing letters of introduction, and they rarely consider how to better ensure the completion of basic construction tasks and whether the labor demand plans of construction units are reasonable. Because the allocation of construction workers is rarely carried out in a planned and organized manner according to the principles of rational use of labor and the actual number of people, types of work, technical conditions, and time required, there is still a fairly serious waste of labor.
    Secondly, the planning of labor use in construction units is still very poor. Because construction units cannot make plans on time or change plans at any time, and sometimes they are not used after being transferred according to the plan, which causes worker dissatisfaction and makes it difficult for allocation agencies to deal with. This is mainly due to the late determination of construction tasks, large changes, designs that cannot keep up with construction, untimely supply of raw materials, lack of experience, and some departmentalism. Some construction units are afraid of insufficient labor and failing to complete the tasks, so they fix and reserve a large number of workers. Some units would rather idle workers than lend them to other units. Some units do not pay attention to improving labor organization and strengthening internal scheduling, which has resulted in a fairly common phenomenon of idling workers, affecting worker morale and causing serious losses to the country. Of course, it is impossible to completely avoid idling today, but proper allocation can undoubtedly greatly reduce idling. At the same time, some allocation agencies do not understand or do not fully understand the number, types of work, sources, destinations, and principles of allocation of local construction workers, resulting in the unreasonable phenomenon that on the one hand, the labor demand units cannot find suitable people, and on the other hand, some units are idling or some workers have no work to do, which has caused criticism from all sides and often makes the work passive.
    Thirdly, due to the large number of basic construction tasks and the shortage of technical workers, the publicity and explanation of the laws and regulations on the allocation of construction workers are not enough, and some construction units do not fully understand the importance of unified supply and allocation of labor, so the phenomenon of private recruitment and poaching of workers still occurs from time to time. Many private construction firms poach technical workers from state-owned construction units by raising wages and welfare benefits during the peak construction period, affecting the completion of basic construction tasks. This not only increases the chaos of wages and welfare benefits, but also is not conducive to strengthening the organization of workers and consolidating labor discipline.
    Fourthly, the construction worker team has developed rapidly and is very blind. In terms of types of work, ordinary workers have exceeded actual needs. Among the personnel, not only are there many old, weak, sick, and disabled people who have not been dealt with, but also many politically problematic elements have been mixed in. In 1953, many places carried out the work of rectifying the construction worker team after the completion of basic construction projects, and there have been many improvements, but to solve this problem more thoroughly, we still need to continue to work hard in the future.
    Fifthly, the standards for wages, working hours, and labor insurance benefits have not been unified. At present, there are large differences in the treatment of construction workers between regions, units, and public and private sectors. There are many different systems in the same city, and even within a construction engineering company. Technical standards are very chaotic. Labor quotas have been promoted more successfully in some areas, some are perfunctory, and some have not yet been formulated. The existence of these problems is an important reason for workers' unwillingness to obey the allocation and jump factories; and it affects worker morale and hinders their enthusiasm for production.
    Sixthly, due to the unclear tasks and scope of work of the construction worker allocation work, the staffing problem of the allocation agencies has not been resolved, which has also created some difficulties and confusion. Some places have heavy basic construction tasks, but the allocation agencies have not been appropriately strengthened; some places do not have important basic construction tasks, but have established special management agencies for allocation work. In many places, because the cadres of the allocation work are not included in the administrative establishment and rely on collecting allocation handling fees to maintain, the work is affected due to insufficient funds in some places; many places cause great waste due to excessive charges. Many allocation agencies have a lot of surplus in addition to regular expenses, so some set up worker clinics, hold relief for worker families, or allocate funds to the trade union as worker welfare funds, which not only wastes national construction funds, but also has caused dissatisfaction among some employers. At the same time, some allocation work cadres are uneasy because they have been "eating allocation handling fees" for a long time. All of these are inseparable from the shortcomings of the Central Labor Department's failure to pay attention to strengthening the leadership of the construction worker allocation work, formulating necessary unified systems, and organizing experience exchange in a timely manner.
      (III)
    To overcome the shortcomings existing in the current construction worker allocation work, according to the work experience of various places in the past two or three years, the following issues must be paid attention to and resolved:
    First of all, we should gradually achieve the planned and organized supply of labor for basic construction to reduce idling and waste, save national funds, and ensure the smooth completion of national basic construction tasks. The specific work of the construction worker allocation agencies should be: study the labor demand situation of construction units in the jurisdiction, introduce and supply the labor needed for basic construction; make necessary and possible adjustments according to the plans of basic construction units and labor needs; assist construction units in promoting advanced experience, improving labor organization, and gradually achieving the rational use of labor. In addition, the labor department must also assist basic construction units in training technical workers.
    Secondly, with the development of the country's planned economic construction, we must gradually achieve the planning of labor. We must urge and assist construction units to formulate labor demand plans on time according to their engineering tasks, construction progress, and existing labor situation. Urge and assist construction units to establish and improve their internal allocation system, first seek the balance of their own labor, and then carry out adjustment and allocation between units within a city to seek the balance of the whole city, and on this basis gradually achieve the balance of a region and the whole country. The allocation agencies established by various construction units should be guided by the local labor administrative organs in their work. The fixed workers of various industrial management agencies (including construction engineering companies) may be transferred between regions within their own system, but they should report the dispatch plan to the local labor administrative organs on time so that the local labor can be balanced. Private recruitment and poaching of workers should be strictly prohibited. Local labor administrative organs should formulate specific implementation measures for the above items according to local conditions and report them to the local people's government for approval and implementation, except for those uniformly stipulated by the central government.
    Thirdly, we should gradually unify wages, working hours, technical standards, and labor insurance benefits. This is an arduous task that cannot be accomplished overnight. At present, we should first stop the development of chaos, and then gradually achieve national unity from the unity of a city and the unity of a region according to the central principles. The labor department should work hard in this regard in coordination with the construction management organs and trade union organizations. In addition, we should also stipulate the method of signing labor contracts as the basis for construction units and workers to sign contracts, so as to avoid differences in treatment, disputes, and passive work.
    Fourthly, we must rectify the construction worker allocation agencies. Cities with more basic construction tasks should establish and improve the construction worker allocation agencies, and cities with very few basic construction tasks do not need to set up special management agencies. The cadres of the allocation work are best included in the administrative establishment; before being included in the administrative establishment, handling fees may be collected as appropriate to solve the problem. However, it should be limited to regular administrative expenses in principle and should not be excessive. The labor administrative departments of the major regions are responsible for rectifying this to overcome the existing chaos.
    Finally, to complete the above tasks, we must work closely with the relevant parties such as the basic construction management organs and trade union organizations under the unified leadership of the Party. Basic construction involves many aspects and many heads. Major issues such as the queue of engineering tasks and the unification of wages and welfare benefits can only be resolved by the local Party committee. Therefore, the allocation agency should often report the situation to the Party committee, put forward methods, and request instructions. When carrying out the work, on the one hand, we must establish regular contact with construction engineering companies and construction units, fully listen to their opinions, understand the characteristics and requirements of basic construction, so that the formulated allocation system and methods meet the needs of basic construction, in order to achieve the purpose of serving basic construction; on the other hand, we must rely closely on the trade union, only in this way can we easily understand the workers' political and technical situation, grasp the workers' trends, educate the workers, rectify the worker team, promote advanced experience, and implement the allocation system. At the same time, the cadres of the allocation work must thoroughly study the characteristics of basic construction work and find out the laws of work from it. Only in this way can the allocation work be closely combined with the needs of basic construction and gradually achieve the rational use of labor, and gradually transform the allocation work from passive to active and do the work well.

    做好建筑工人调配工作为国家基本建设服务
    （一）
    中央人民政府劳动部副部长　毛齐华
    国家过渡时期的总任务和第一个五年建设计划的基本任务对建筑工人调配工作提出了新的要求和任务。这就是要逐步做到有计划有组织地供应基本建设所需要的劳动力，协助建筑企业改进劳动组织，保证国家基本建设任务的胜利完成。为适应这种需要，到一九五三年底全国设立了建筑工人调配机构的城市已增至九十三个，并有两个大行政区、五个省、十九个市颁布了建筑工人调配办法，因而使工作有了进一步的开展。
    一九五三年各级劳动行政部门初步建立了建筑工人统一调配制度，批判了某些国营建筑单位盲目招工、挖工等行为，限制了私营营造厂商漠视国家法令乱挖工人的不法行为，逐步减少了农民盲目流入城市的混乱现象；协助建筑单位进行了劳动力的调剂，加强了使用劳动力的计划性，制订了技术标准，规定并推行了劳动定额，从而提高了劳动生产率，在改进企业管理上也起了一定作用；基本上克服了建筑工人盲目流动的现象，目前不仅是对固定工人，就是临时工、季节工的招收亦有了一定的制度。
    不少地方劳动行政部门还协助建筑单位进行了固定建筑工人、冬训、整顿队伍等工作，提高了工人的政治、技术和文化水平，并使建筑队伍日渐纯洁。
      （二）
    过去建筑工人调配工作虽有一定的成绩，但还存在不少问题：
    首先，劳动行政部门对调配工作应为基本建设服务的任务认识不够明确。有些地方开始是为了失业人员就业而进行调配工作，介绍了一些不适当的人员到建筑单位，甚至有些是老、弱、病、残人员，以致影响了生产。有的地方在给建筑单位介绍工人时采取了所谓好坏搭配的办法。有的地方把建筑工人调配看成是临时性的工作，认为建筑工人固定下来后也就没事了。有的地方看不见建设时期新的需要，工作还停留在开介绍信的阶段，对于怎样才能更好地保证基本建设任务的完成，建筑单位的需工计划是否合理，则很少考虑。由于建筑工人调配工作，还很少根据合理使用劳动力的原则，按照实际需要的人数、工种、技术条件、时间等有计划、有组织地进行调配，因此在劳动力使用方面还存在有相当严重的浪费现象。
    其次，目前建筑单位使用劳动力的计划性还很差。由于建筑单位不能按期做出计划，或随时改变计划，而且有时按计划调去又不用了，以致引起工人不满，使调配机关难于处理。这主要是由于建筑任务确定迟，变动大，设计赶不上施工，原材料供应不及时，经验不足，加上某些本位主义思想所造成。有些建筑单位害怕劳动力不足，完不成任务，便大量固定和预约工人，有的单位宁肯窝工也不肯将工人借给别的单位，有的单位不注意改进劳动组织和加强内部调度工作，便产生了相当普遍的窝工现象，影响工人生产情绪，也给国家造成了严重的损失。当然要完全避免窝工今天还不可能，但调配得当无疑地是可以大大减少窝工的。同时有些调配机关对于当地建筑工人数目、工种、来源、去向以及应当根据什么原则调配等方面不了解或不够了解，结果也就形成一方面需工单位找不到适当的人，另方面某些单位又在窝工或产生一些工人没有工作做的不合理现象，因而引起各方面的责难，往往使工作陷于被动。
    第三，由于基本建设任务大，技术工人不足，对于建筑工人调配法令宣传解释不够，某些建筑单位还不完全了解劳动力统一供应调配的重要性，以致私自招工、挖工的现象仍然时有发生。不少私营营造厂在施工紧张阶段以提高工资福利待遇等办法挖走国营建筑单位的技术工人，影响基本建设任务的完成。这不仅增加了工资福利待遇的混乱，而且对加强工人的组织性，巩固劳动纪律都是不利的。
    第四，建筑工人队伍发展很快，且带有很大的盲目性，在工种方面普通工人超过了实际需要。在人员中不仅有许多老、弱、病、残人员没有处理，并混进了不少政治上有问题的分子。一九五三年在基本建设工程结束后许多地方进行了整顿建筑工人队伍的工作，已有不少改进，但要比较彻底地解决这个问题，还有待于今后继续努力。
    第五，工资、工时、劳保福利标准还没有统一。目前建筑工人待遇在地区之间、单位之间、公私之间差别很大，同一城市也有许多不同的制度，甚至在一个建筑工程公司内部也不一致。技术标准很混乱。劳动定额有些地区推行得较有成绩，有的流于形式，有的还没有制订。这些问题的存在，是引起工人不愿服从调配和跳厂的重要原因；并影响工人情绪，妨害其生产积极性的发挥。
    第六，由于建筑工人调配工作任务和工作范围不明确，调配机构编制问题没有得到解决，也产生了一些困难和混乱现象。有些地方基本建设任务繁重，但调配机构未能适当加强；有些地方没有重要的基本建设任务，却又设立了调配工作的专管机构。许多地方由于调配工作干部未列入行政编制，靠征收调配手续费维持，有的地方因经费不足而影响工作；有不少地方则因收费过多而造成很大浪费。不少调配机关除经常费开支外，结余甚多，于是有的便设立工人诊疗所，举办工人家属救济，或将款项拨交工会作为工人福利经费，不仅浪费了国家建设资金，并曾引起某些用人单位的不满，同时有的调配工作干部又因长期“吃调配手续费”而情绪不安。所有这些，都是与中央劳动部没有及时注意加强对建筑工人调配工作的领导，制订必要的统一的制度，组织经验交流等缺点分不开的。
      （三）
    要克服目前建筑工人调配工作中所存在的缺点，根据两三年来各地工作经验，必须注意和解决下列几个问题：
    首先，应当逐步做到有计划有组织地供应基本建设的劳动力，以减少窝工浪费现象，节省国家资金，保证国家基本建设任务的顺利完成。建筑工人调配机关的具体工作应当是：研究所辖地区建筑单位需工情况，介绍与供应基本建设所需要的劳动力；根据基本建设单位的计划和劳动力的需要情况进行必要与可能的调剂；协助建筑单位推广先进经验、改进劳动组织，逐步达到合理使用劳动力。此外劳动部门还须协助基本建设单位培养技术工人。
    其次，必须随着国家有计划的经济建设的发展逐步做到劳动力的计划化。必须督促与协助建筑单位根据其工程任务、施工进度和现有劳动力情况按期制订需工计划。督促与协助建筑单位建立和健全其内部的调配制度，首先求得本身的劳动力平衡，进而在一个市的范围内进行单位与单位之间的调剂和调配，以求全市的平衡，并在此基础上逐步达到一个地区及全国的平衡。各建筑单位所设立的调配机构，在业务上应受当地劳动行政机关的指导。各产业管理机关（包括建筑工程公司）的固定工人，在本系统内得在地区之间自行调动，但应按期做出调度计划报告当地劳动行政机关，以便当地进行劳动力的平衡。对于私自招工、挖工行为应严格制止。对于私营建筑单位的劳动力各地应根据当地情况加以必要的控制和管理。上述各项除中央统一规定者外，各地劳动行政机关应根据当地情况拟出具体实施办法，报请当地人民政府批准公布施行。
    第三，应逐渐统一工资、工时、技术标准、劳保福利待遇。这是一件繁重的工作，不能一蹴而就。目前应首先制止混乱现象的发展，然后根据中央的原则规定由一个城市的统一、地区的统一逐步做到全国的统一。劳动部门要协同建筑管理机关和工会组织在这一方面作很大的努力。此外，还应规定订立劳动合同的办法，作为建筑单位与工人签订合同的依据，以免待遇高低不一，发生纠纷，造成工作被动。
    第四，必须整顿建筑工人调配机构。基本建设任务较多的城市应建立和健全建筑工人调配机构，基本建设任务很少的城市则不必设立专管机构。调配工作干部最好是列入行政编制；在未列入行政编制前，可酌量征收手续费解决。但应以限于经常行政开支为原则，不应过多，由各大区劳动行政部门负责对此加以整顿，以克服目前存在的混乱现象。
    最后，要完成上述任务，必须在党的统一领导下，与基本建设管理机关和工会组织等有关方面密切配合进行工作。基本建设牵涉的方面多，头多，如像工程任务的排队、工资福利待遇的统一等重大问题，只有当地党委决定才好解决。所以调配机关就应当经常向党委汇报情况，提出办法，请求指示。在进行工作时，一方面要与建筑工程公司和施工单位建立经常的联系，充分听取他们的意见，了解基本建设的特点和要求，使制订的调配制度和办法符合基本建设的需要，以达到为基本建设服务的目的；另一方面要紧紧地依靠工会，只有这样，才便于了解工人的政治、技术情况，掌握工人动向，对工人进行教育，整顿工人队伍，推行先进经验，贯彻调配制度。同时调配工作干部必须深入研究基本建设工作的特点，从中找出工作规律，只有这样，才能使调配工作密切结合基本建设的需要前进，才能逐步做到劳动力的合理使用，才能逐渐使调配工作从被动转为主动，把工作做好。
