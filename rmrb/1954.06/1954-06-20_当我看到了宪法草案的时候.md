When I Saw the Draft Constitution
People's Liberation Army First-Class Study Model, Guan Zhenling

"The draft constitution is published! The draft constitution is published!" The messenger, holding a large stack of newspapers, shouted as he came out of the dispatch room. I was organizing books in the room and was attracted by this sudden good news and ran out of the library. I followed the messenger like I was chasing happiness and light and entered the cultural section. I picked up a newspaper from the table and saw a large photograph of the Central People's Government Committee passing the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China, with Chairman Mao standing in the center. With extremely excited feelings, I read it sentence by sentence, and the words that marked the vital interests of the Chinese people deeply touched my heart. As I read, I shed tears of happiness; then, painful past events flooded my mind one by one:

I was only eleven years old when, on a late autumn evening, my father, who supported a family of six, pulled a rickshaw out. I helped him push the rickshaw out the door, and he turned around and said to me, "Zhenling, don't be naughty, I'll bring you something good to eat!" Who would have thought that the dark society had already reached out its bloody hand to us, and this would be our last meeting!

The second and third watch were struck, and my mother sat under the oil lamp mending our torn clothes. She went outside more than once to look, and even the slightest movement she thought was the sound of the rickshaw. "It's this late, why hasn't Dad come back yet?" I was thinking drowsily when I was awakened by my mother's sudden wail. I jumped up and ran to the courtyard without putting on my shoes. At this time, my mother had fainted outside the second gate, and a policeman was standing in front of her.

"It's really unexpected!" "What will happen to these orphans and widows?" The neighbors discussed sympathetically. At first, I couldn't figure out what was going on, but after listening carefully, oh my god! It turned out that my father was killed by a warlord's "dudu car" on Xidan North Street! In those years, a poor man's life was really not as good as a dog's. What was morality, what was law? The driver who killed someone with his car was taken out of the police station by a phone call before dawn. "It's lucky that you weren't asked to pay for the car." This was the word from the head of the Second Precinct of the police station.

In order to survive, the family was scattered. I went to be an apprentice, getting up before dawn and not being able to sleep until eleven or twelve o'clock. It wasn't enough to be beaten and scolded, and it was harder than climbing to the sky to learn a craft. My eldest apprentice brother worked for the boss for more than ten years, and until the day he was exhausted and vomited blood, he was still a half-price apprentice. The clothes on his body were thrown on the street and no one picked them up.

When I saw the draft constitution stating: "All power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people." "Citizens of the People's Republic of China are equal before the law." and "Working people of the People's Republic of China have the right to material assistance when they are old, sick, or have lost their ability to work. ..." I thought of the happy life that the working people have already obtained and the even happier future, and the tears that I had been holding back burst out again. I knew that the dark society was gone forever, and the life of being worse than pigs and dogs had become history, but I also realized more deeply that the source of a happy life and the birth of the constitution were bought with the blood and sacrifice of countless revolutionary martyrs. We should protect the dignity of the constitution like we protect our eyes.

Thinking about my participation in the revolution, I haven't contributed much to the people, but I've only done the work I should do, and the people have given me the glorious title of "First-Class Study Model" and enjoy all the democratic rights stipulated in the constitution. I am determined to fulfill the glorious responsibilities stipulated in the constitution, fully fulfill the obligations that a citizen should fulfill, stand firm at my post as a soldier, and fight against all phenomena that destroy or damage the dignity of the constitution, defend the security of the motherland and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty, so that our motherland, according to the road planned by the constitution, will be built into a happy and beautiful socialist society as soon as possible.

    当我看到了宪法草案的时候
    人民解放军一等学习功臣　关振铃
    “宪法草案公布了，宪法草案公布了！”通信员怀抱着一大叠报纸，从收发室里喊着出来。我正在屋里整理书籍，被这突然而来的喜讯吸引着跑出了图书室。我像追赶幸福和光明似地跟着通信员，走进了文化科。从桌子上拿起报来一看，迎面就是中央人民政府委员会通过中华人民共和国宪法草案时的一张大照片，毛主席站在中央。我以极兴奋、激动的心情，一句一句地往下读着，那些标志着中国人民的切身利益的字句，深深地打动着我的心。看着看着，我流下了幸福的热泪；紧接着，痛苦的往事又一件件涌上了心头：
    还是我十一岁时的一个深秋的晚上，一家六口靠他为生的爸爸，拉着洋车出去，我帮他把车子推出门坎，他回过头来对我说：“振铃啊，别淘气，我给你带好吃的来！”哪知道，黑暗的社会已经向我们伸出了血手，这就是我们最后一次见面呢！
    二更、三更都敲过了，母亲坐在油灯下给我们补破衣裳。她不止一次地跑到外面去看，甚至一点动静她就认为是车响。“天到这会啦，怎么爸爸还不回来呀？”我正迷迷糊糊地想着，被妈妈突然的嚎哭声惊醒了。一骨碌爬起来，没穿鞋就往当院跑。这时，妈妈已昏倒二门外，她面前站着一个警察。
    “真是想不到的事！”“撇下这些孤儿寡妇可怎么办哪？”邻居街坊们同情地谈论着。开始我还摸不清是怎么回事，等细细一听，哎，天哪！原来我爸爸被军阀的“嘟嘟车”在西单北大街给撞死了！那年头，穷人一条命真不如一条狗，什么叫情理，什么叫法律，撞死了人的汽车司机，没等天亮，就被人家一个电话要出了警察局。“没叫你们赔人家汽车就算是万幸。”这是警察局内二分局局长的话。
    为了活着，一家人走散了，我去当了学徒，天不亮就起床，十一、二点还不能睡觉，挨打受骂还不算，打算学一份手艺真比登天还难。我的大师兄给掌柜的干了十几年，直到累得吐血而死的那天，还是个半价的徒工，身上的衣服扔到当街都没人拾。
    当我看到宪法草案上写着：“中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。”“中华人民共和国公民在法律上一律平等。”以及“中华人民共和国劳动者在年老、疾病或者丧失劳动能力的时候，有获得物质帮助的权利。……”我想起了现在劳动人民已经获得的幸福生活和更加幸福的将来，我忍了又忍的眼泪又夺眶而出。我知道，黑暗的社会已一去不返，猪狗不如的生活已成了历史，但我也更深刻的认识到，幸福生活的来源、宪法的诞生，是无数革命先烈流血牺牲换来的，我们应该像保护眼睛一样地保护宪法的尊严。
    想我参加革命以来，对人民贡献不多，只不过做了我应该做的工作，人民就给了我“一等学习功臣”的光荣称号。并享受到宪法上规定的一切民主权利。我有决心，履行宪法中规定的光荣职责，全部尽到一个公民应尽的义务，并站稳战士的岗位，和一切破坏或损害宪法尊严的现象斗争，保卫祖国的安全和领土主权的完整，使我们的祖国，根据宪法所规划的道路，早日建成幸福美好的社会主义社会。
