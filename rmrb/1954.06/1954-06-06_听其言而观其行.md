    Listen to What They Say and Watch What They Do
    By Our Correspondents Wu Wentao and Du Bo
    From Geneva, you can only vaguely see France, but as the Foreign Ministers' Conference progresses, you will directly perceive the increasingly fierce tremors in France—the tremors of the people's demand for a swift and comprehensive end to the war in Indochina.

    The debate on the Indochina issue in the French National Assembly, which began on June 1st, may lead to a vote of "confidence" in the cabinet for the third time in a month. In the surging rallies of people from all walks of life, especially workers, across the country, people demanded that the Laniel cabinet swiftly achieve a just and lasting peace in Indochina, and continue to send delegations across the border to Geneva to convey their will. According to incomplete statistics, on Sunday alone, fifty-four delegations, including four hundred and sixty-eight people, arrived. What is most touching is the delegation of railway workers from Roessel, who visited the residences of the government delegations of the five major powers, and then presented the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with a red, white, and blue tricolor flag signed by three thousand residents of Roessel, expressing that true freedom, equality, and fraternity should belong to the people of Indochina...

    Faced with this increasingly strong demand from the people across the country, today almost no one in power in France dares to openly declare that they do not want peace talks. However, if you listen to what they say and watch what they do, the actions of the French cabinet have repeatedly violated the French people's urgent desire for peace and for a swift end to the "dirty war" in Indochina.

    Observers familiar with the French political situation point out that as a result of the US-French negotiations, the French cabinet has "taken drastic steps" on May 28th, passing a resolution to advance the enlistment of the second batch of young people for 1954. On the surface, the purpose of this measure is only to establish a so-called general reserve division in order to draw regular French troops from the French mainland, West Germany, and North Africa and send them to Indochina; but in fact, it also includes sending new recruits to the Indochina battlefield quickly. According to this conscription order disclosed by the French newspapers, more than 80,000 young people, originally scheduled to enlist in October this year, will be called up between June 28th and July 10th, starting at the end of June. According to the French constitution, sending conscripted young people overseas must be approved by the parliament. The warmongering elements in the French cabinet, fearing that the parliament would obstruct their plan to expand the war, hastily sought various pretexts, such as saying that the dispatch of newly enlisted soldiers only applies to "non-combat zones," and that places like Saigon are "non-combat areas." This means that new recruits can still enter the war through Saigon. Furthermore, according to the German "Nuremberg News" on May 29th: "In order to encourage active soldiers to volunteer for the Indochina war, the French government has decided to give each person a reward of 75,000 francs for continuing to stay in the army for eighteen months, one year of which is in Indochina." In addition, it is widely rumored that US General O'Daniel is accelerating the implementation of his vast plan to train puppet troops in Indochina...

    Along with the expansion of the army, the French government is planning to increase military spending for the Indochina war this year. According to Agence France-Presse, the French cabinet meeting will have to resolve this issue soon. The additional military expenditure is about 70 billion to 85 billion francs, and its main source is opening up new taxes and raising taxes. This is obviously beyond the ability of the heavily burdened French people. The French "Liberation" newspaper indignantly said on June 3rd: "The cost of this accursed Indochina war will add 85 billion francs to the (originally planned) 626 billion francs this year. This tragic and bloody adventure has cost 3 trillion francs in the past eight years. Today, 85 billion francs must be thrown into this bottomless pit. So much money could have been used to build a beautiful France." The newspaper then asked: "What does this mean? The government either does not believe in a ceasefire, or it is making preparations to continue the war from now on. What else could it mean?"

    Of course, people have also noticed the recent active participation of the French government in the "Five-Nation Military Conference" instigated by the United States, as well as its support for the Thai "appeal" to include the Indochina issue on the agenda of the Security Council, which was also directed by the United States. On June 3rd, the "Five-Nation Military Conference" began at the Pentagon in Washington. Thailand's "appeal" has also been successfully included in the preliminary agenda of the Security Council at Lake Success in New York. Eisenhower said at a press conference that day: "The daily work of military and diplomats to explore the course of action in Southeast Asia will conform to the interests of the United States..." The "interests" mentioned here by the US President can only be explained as "war profits."

    It is not difficult to see that all the above-mentioned series of policies and measures are aimed at expanding the war, seeking "moral legitimacy" for further US intervention, and complicating the Indochina issue. In order to cover the eyes and ears of the people, some French officials and diplomats are engaging in deception and sophistry. They say, "We want negotiations, not surrender," "We cannot talk diplomacy in the event of military failure"... Reflected in the Geneva Conference, Bidault followed the various delaying tactics used by the US delegation.

    It is generally believed that despite the considerable progress made at the conference, powerful elements in the US and France will continue to implement delaying and destructive tactics step by step in several important links in the future, making the conference protracted and creating excuses for expanding the war. For example: 1. Creating extraneous issues regarding the members and powers of the neutral nations supervisory commission and international guarantees; 2. Proposing unrealistic and unreasonable plans regarding the demarcation of troop regrouping areas; 3. Continuing to deny reality on the issues of Laos and Cambodia, while insisting on their unreasonable so-called "Viet Minh aggression" theory; 4. Using the three Indochinese puppet governments as shields in resolving political issues to achieve national democratic unity in Indochina.

    However, no matter how these gentlemen pretend to want to negotiate, any delaying tactics cannot deceive the French people. The Associated Press also had to admit that some people in the French parliament "have always accused him (referring to Bidault) of reporting one thing to France and another to the Americans, and some parliamentarians said that he is playing a double game." The French "Observer" weekly pointed out: "Clearly, until recently, Bidault was playing with the conspiracy of American intervention and the internationalization of the war." The "Observer" weekly even suspected that Bidault's agreement on the principle of simultaneous ceasefire and consultation between the representatives of the two commands regarding troop regrouping on May 29th was only "a temporary measure, that is, until the current balance of power in Southeast Asia is overturned. The United States and Bidault are considering the agreement they may sign in Geneva from this perspective." This is the background for the French National Assembly's third request to debate the Indochina issue.

    As Communist parliamentarian Joinville said in parliament when calling for opposition to the French cabinet's measures to expand the war, "Only if the National Assembly expresses the almost unanimous opinion of the French people and rejects the decisions of Pleven, Bidault, and Laniel..., can it fulfill its responsibility. If the war in Indochina is still being carried out against all reason, it is because the United States needs a series of wars in order to maintain the level of its war economy. The world domination desires of the most corrupt financiers in the United States are built on our burden, built on our bloodshed. The recent measures taken by the government will directly lead to national suicide, and this is what those vultures who prey on the victims—the American arms dealers—are promoting and hoping for"...

    Although the continuation of the National Assembly debate has been postponed until next week due to the French Communist Party holding a representative congress and the French Communist Party members being unable to attend, what awaits the warmongers in the French cabinet will be increasingly intensified questions and accusations. For more than a month, it was only because the current cabinet participated in the Geneva Conference and released a certain optimistic atmosphere and some agreements reached before each parliamentary debate that the precarious Laniel cabinet was spared from collapsing. The general opinion is that, no matter what the outcome of next Tuesday's parliamentary debate or vote of confidence, in the final analysis, the deciding factor is not the words of those in power, but to break away from the bankrupt old path of colonialism in practical actions, and to achieve a swift and comprehensive peace by starting from satisfying the national rights of the Indochinese people and appropriately taking care of France's economic and cultural interests.

    This is the purpose of the Indochinese people's bloody struggle, which no force can resist. This is also the glorious peace that the French people are running around and crying out for resolutely demanding. June 5th

    听其言而观其行
    本报记者　吴文焘　杜波
    从日内瓦你只能隐约地看到法兰西，可是随着外长会议的进程，你会直接觉察到法兰西的日益激烈的震荡——人民要求迅速全面停止印度支那战争的声浪的震荡。
    六月一日起开始的法国国民议会关于印度支那问题的辩论，可能导向月余来第三次对内阁“信任”与否的投票。在全国各地各阶层人民特别是工人的风起云涌的集会上，人们要求拉尼埃内阁迅速实现印度支那的公正和持久和平，并继续派代表团越过国境到日内瓦来传达自己的意志。根据不完全的统计，单只上星期天，就来了包括四百六十八人的五十四个代表团。最使人感动的是罗色尔的铁路工人代表们，他们走遍了五大国政府代表团的住处，随后又把罗色尔三千居民签了字的一面红白蓝三色旗，献给越南民主共和国的代表团，表示真正的自由、平等和博爱应当属于印度支那人民……。
    面对着全国人民的这种日益强烈的要求，今天法国当权者们几乎没有人敢于公开声明不要和谈的了。但是，如果听其言而观其行，那么，法国内阁的所作所为，却一再违背着法国人民这种要求和平、要求迅速结束印度支那这场“肮脏的战争”的迫切愿望。
    熟悉法国政情的观察家们指出，作为美法谈判的一个结果，五月二十八日法国内阁已“采取激烈的步骤”，通过了一项决议，提前征召一九五四年度第二批青年入伍。从表面看，这个措施的目的只是建立所谓总预备师，以便抽调在法国本土、西德和北非的法国正规军，送往印度支那去；但事实上，还包括迅速把新兵送至印度支那战场。根据法国报纸所披露的这一征兵令，将在六月底开始实施限令原定在今年十月间入伍的青年八万余人提前在六月二十八日至七月十日之间被召入伍。按照法国的宪法规定，把被征召来的青年送往海外，必需经过议会批准。法国内阁的主战分子们害怕议会阻挠他们这一扩大战争的计划，就匆忙找寻各种遁词，如说对于派遣新入伍兵只适用于“非战斗区”，而像西贡这些地方是“非战斗地区”。这就是说，新兵们还是可以从西贡这个门路进入战争。另据德国“纽伦堡新闻报”五月二十九日载：“法政府为了鼓励现役军人志愿报名参加印度支那战争，决定对于继续留在军队十八个月，其中一年在印度支那者，每人发给七万五千法郎的赏金”。此外，各方盛传美国的奥丹尼尔将军正在加速实行其在印度支那训练伪军的庞大计划……。
    随着扩军，法国政府正在筹划追加今年印度支那战争的军事费用。据法新社透露：法国内阁会议近日就得解决这个问题。追加的军费约在七百亿到八百五十亿法郎，它的主要来源就是开辟新税和加税。这对于负担奇重的法国人民来说，显然是力不胜任的。法国“解放报”六月三日愤慨地说：“这场可诅咒的印度支那战争的花费，今年要在（原订）六千二百六十亿法郎以外还加上八百五十亿法郎，这场可悲的血腥的冒险过去八年已经花了三万亿法郎，今天向这个无底洞中还要扔进去八百五十亿，这么许多钱老早可以把法国全部建设美好了。”该报接着问道：“这说明了什么呢？政府不是不相信停火，就是要从现在起作出继续战争的部署。除此之外，还会有什么含义呢？”
    当然，人们还注意到最近法国政府的积极地参加为美国所策动的“五国军事会议”，以及赞助同样为美国所导演的将印度支那问题列入安理会议程的泰国“呼吁”。六月三日，“五国军事会议”已在华盛顿五角大楼开始了。泰国的“呼吁”也在纽约成功湖列入了安理会初步议程。艾森豪威尔当日在记者招待会上说：“军事和外交家们为试探在东南亚的行动途径，每日的工作都将符合美国……的利益。”美国总统这里所说的“利益”，自然只能解释为“战争利润”的。
    不难看出，所有上述一系列的政策和措施，无一不是为了扩大战争，为美国的进一步干涉寻找“道义上的合法性”，并使印度支那问题复杂化的。为了遮盖人民的耳目，法国的一些当权者和外交家们就进行欺诈和诡辩了。他们说，“我们要谈判，不要投降”，“在军事失败时不能谈外交”……。反映在日内瓦会议上，就是皮杜尔追随着美国代表团所使用着的各种拖延手法。
    一般认为，尽管会议已有了不少进展，美法有势力的方面今后还会在几个重要的环节一步接一步地实行怠工和破坏，使会议旷日持久，为扩大战争制造借口。例如：一、在中立国监察委员会的成员和职权以及在国际保证问题上节外生枝；二、在划定双方部队集结地区问题上提出不合实际情况的不合理方案；三、在寮国和高棉问题上继续不承认现实，而坚持其无理的所谓“越盟侵略”论；四、在解决政治问题以实现印度支那各国的民族民主统一上，利用印度支那三个傀儡政府来作挡箭牌等。
    但是，不管这些先生们装做怎样要谈判的样子，任何拖延手法都是瞒不过法国人民的。美联社也不得不承认，法国议会“一向有人指责他（指皮杜尔）对法国报告的是一套，对美国人说的又是一套，有些议员说，他是在耍两面手法”。法国“观察者”周刊指出：“显然地，直到最近为止，皮杜尔玩弄的是美国干涉和战争国际化的阴谋”。“观察者”周刊甚至怀疑皮杜尔在五月二十九日就同时停战和双方司令部代表会商军队集结等原则问题达成协议，也只是“一个暂时的办法，也就是说，直到东南亚目前的实力对比被推翻为止。美国和皮杜尔正是在这一远景下来考虑他们将可能在日内瓦签订的协议的。”这就是法国国民议会第三次要求辩论印度支那问题的背景。
    正如共产党议员儒恩维尔在议会中号召反对法国内阁扩大战争措施时所说的，“如果国民议会表达法国人民的几乎一致的意见，拒绝了普利文、皮杜尔和拉尼埃们的决定……，它才能算尽了自己的责任。如果印度支那的战争还在违反一切理性下进行着，那就是因为美国需要一系列的战争，以便保持其战争经济的水平。美国的最腐败的财政家们的统治世界的欲望，就是建筑在我国的负担上，建筑在我们流血上。政府最近所采取的措施，将直接导向民族的自杀，而这是那些攫食牺牲品的鹰鹫——美国的军火商人们所促成和盼望的”……。
    虽然国民议会的继续辩论，由于法共举行代表大会法共议员不克参加，而延缓到下周举行，但是等候着法国内阁主战派的，将是愈加激烈化的质问和责备。一月余来，只是由于现内阁参加了日内瓦会议，并在历次议会辩论前夕放出某种乐观的空气和达成的某些协议，才使风雨飘摇的拉尼埃内阁免于倒塌。一般的舆论是，不论下星期二议会辩论或信任投票的结果如何，最终计算起来，决定的因素，不是政府当道者的言论，而是在实际行动中脱离那破了产的殖民主义的老路，从满足印度支那人民的民族权利出发，在适当照顾法国的经济文化利益下，达到迅速全面的和平。
    这就是没有任何力量足以抗拒的印度支那人民流血斗争的目的。这也是法国人民奔走呼号坚决要求的光荣的和平。　六月五日
