    The CCP Central Committee South Central Bureau
    Convenes the First Regional Handicraft Work Conference
    The CCP Central Committee South Central Bureau convened the first regional handicraft work conference from June 10th to 24th. The conference summarized the preliminary experiences of various locations in the South Central region in focusing on piloting handicraft cooperatives over the past few years, and determined the overall plan for developing handicraft cooperatives in the South Central region by 1957.
    The South Central region has a relatively large amount of handicraft industry. According to incomplete statistics, there are approximately three million people engaged in handicrafts throughout the region, and the total output value in 1953 accounted for approximately 12% of the total industrial and agricultural output value of the region. Various forms of handicraft cooperative organizations throughout the region have achieved certain results through key pilot projects in recent years, and have created preliminary experience for the future development of handicraft cooperative organizations. As of the end of May this year, approximately 180,000 handicraft laborers in the region participated in various cooperative organizations, including 1,427 handicraft production cooperatives with 74,294 members. Handicraft cooperative organizations have shown great advantages in increasing production, increasing income, improving technology, reducing costs, overcoming difficulties in production, and complying with national plans. In particular, handicraft production cooperatives have established a model in the minds of the vast number of handicraft laborers. Currently, 70% of the handicraft production cooperatives in the region can carry out production in accordance with national plans. For example, in January and February of this year, 213 handicraft production cooperatives in Henan Province signed production, supply, and sales contracts with state-owned trade departments and supply and marketing cooperatives. Most of the more than 80 production cooperatives in Wuhan have accepted state orders. In 1953, handicraft production cooperatives throughout the region supplied 4.19 million pieces of large and small agricultural tools to rural areas, 1,548 new-style agricultural tools, more than 320,000 tons of lime, and supplied daily necessities with a total value of more than 480 billion yuan. The products of various handicraft cooperative organizations are generally of better quality and lower price than those of individual handicraft workers. Compared with individual handicraft production, the agricultural tools produced by the 14 ironware production cooperatives in Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province, are not only of higher quality, but also 14% lower in cost. In 1953, the average total output value of members of handicraft production cooperatives throughout the region was more than 23% higher than that of individual handicraft laborers.
    The conference also formulated a development plan for handicraft cooperative organizations in 1954. The plan is to develop production cooperative members to 100,000, supply and marketing production cooperative members to 20,000, and supply and marketing production group members to 130,000 throughout the region.
    The conference studied the experience of various locations in the South Central region in organizing handicraft production cooperatives, and determined that in establishing handicraft production cooperatives, industries with raw materials, sales channels, and development prospects should be selected first as targets for cultivating cooperative establishment, and handicraft workers should be organized in accordance with the principles of voluntarism and mutual benefit to increase production, improve product quality, reduce costs, and increase income. The conference requested all localities to strengthen investigation and research on handicrafts, rank each industry, and formulate specific plans for each region. The conference also studied the leadership issues related to the cooperation of handicrafts, and put forward specific plans to strengthen the leadership of handicrafts. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中共中央中南局
    召开全区第一次手工业工作会议
    中共中央中南局在六月十日到二十四日召开了全区第一次手工业工作会议。会议总结了中南区各地几年来重点试办手工业合作社的初步经验，并确定了中南地区到一九五七年发展手工业合作社的全盘计划。
    中南区是手工业比较多的地区，据不完全统计，全区手工业从业人员约有三百万人，一九五三年生产总值约占全区工农业生产总值的百分之十二左右。全区各种形式的手工业合作组织，近年来经各地重点试办取得了一定成绩，并为今后发展手工业合作组织创造了初步经验。到今年五月底，全区参加各种合作组织的手工业劳动者约有十八万人，其中有手工业生产合作社一千四百二十七个，社员七万四千二百九十四人。手工业合作组织在增加生产、增加收入、提高技术、降低成本、克服生产中的困难及服从国家计划等方面，显示出很大优越性。尤其是手工业生产合作社，已在广大手工业劳动者心目中树立了榜样。目前，全区百分之七十的手工业生产合作社可以按照国家计划进行生产。如河南省今年一、二月份有二百十三个手工业生产合作社和国营贸易部门、供销合作社订立产、供、销结合合同，武汉市八十几个生产社，绝大部分接受国家的订货。一九五三年全区手工业生产合作社供应农村大小农具四百一十九万件，新式农具一千五百四十八件，石灰三十二万多吨，供应生活必需品总值四千八百亿元以上。各种手工业合作组织的产品，一般都比个体手工业者的产品质量好，价格便宜。河南省新乡专区十四个铁器生产合作社所生产的农具和个体手工业生产的比较，不仅质量高，成本还低百分之十四。一九五三年内，全区手工业生产合作社社员平均生产总值，比个体手工业劳动者高出百分之二十三以上。
    这次会议还制定了一九五四年手工业合作组织的发展计划。计划在全区内使生产合作社社员发展到十万人，供销生产社社员发展到两万人，供销生产小组组员发展到十三万人。
    会议研究了中南区各地组织手工业生产合作社的经验，确定在建立手工业生产合作社工作中应该首先选择有原料、有销路、有发展前途的行业作为培养建社对象，切实遵照自愿、互利的原则，把手工业者组织起来，以增加生产、提高产品质量、降低成本、增加收入。会议要求各地加强对手工业的调查研究工作，并把各个行业进行排队，制定各个地区的具体计划。会议并研究了有关手工业合作化的领导问题，对加强手工业的领导提出了具体方案。　（新华社）
