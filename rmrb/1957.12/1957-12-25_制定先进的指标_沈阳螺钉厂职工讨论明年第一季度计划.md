    Shenyang Screw Factory Workers Discuss First Quarter Plan for Next Year
    (Our Newspaper News) According to the Shenyang Daily, the Shenyang Screw Factory is actively mobilizing workers to tap potential and formulate a production plan for the first quarter of next year.
    This factory began mobilizing all workers on December 2nd to discuss the draft national plan for the first quarter of 1958. After preliminary discussions, the targets in the draft plan have already been surpassed. The production value target discussed by the workers is 1.1% higher than the draft plan and 4.5% higher than the estimated completion figure for the fourth quarter of this year. The total commodity value is 2.9% higher than the draft plan; the total output of all products is 7.8% higher than the draft plan.
    Before the discussion, the factory leadership disclosed the bottom line to the workers, pointed out the weak links in production, and explained that increased production must be combined with supply and sales. More should be produced if there are materials and sales channels, and less or none should be produced for products with insufficient materials or poor sales channels. The workers understood the direction of their efforts. During the discussion of the draft plan, they proposed thirty-two measures and sixteen advanced experiences to address the nineteen technical and management problems existing in the factory. The cutting team workers in the hardware workshop revised the equipment utilization rate with revolutionary spirit, further increasing it by 6% on the existing basis; they also proposed to extend the life of the molds, enabling each mold to produce an additional thousand products. In this way, the entire team can complete the plan for the first quarter of next year four days ahead of schedule.
    The factory has also made specific arrangements in terms of material supply, sales, and technology. Due to the workers' research on material substitution, the difficulty of insufficient steel has been overcome, and the needs of production can be basically met. The new equipment needed for next year's production has also begun to be installed.

    制定先进的指标
    沈阳螺钉厂职工讨论明年第一季度计划
    本报讯　据沈阳日报报道：沈阳螺钉厂积极发动职工挖掘潜力，制订明年第一季度的生产计划。
    这个厂在12月2日开始发动全厂职工讨论1958年第一季度国家计划草案。经过初步讨论，计划草案的指标已经被突破。职工讨论的生产总值指标比计划草案提高了1.1％，比今年第四季度预计完成数高4.5％；商品总值比计划草案提高了2.9％；全部产品产量，比计划草案提高了7.8％。
    在讨论以前，工厂领导方面向职工交了底，指出了生产中的薄弱环节，并且说明增产必须同供应和销售结合起来，凡是有材料、有销路的就多生产，材料不足、销路不畅的产品就少生产或者不生产。职工们都了解了努力的方向，在讨论草案的过程中，针对全厂存在的十九个技术和管理中的问题，提出了三十二项措施和十六项先进经验。光制品车间切边组工人以革命精神修订了设备运用率，使设备运用率在现有基础上再提高6％；他们还提出要延长模具的寿命，使每个模具可用来多生产一千个产品。这样，全组可以提前四天完成明年第一季度的计划。
    在材料供应、销售、工艺等方面，厂里也都进行了具体安排。由于职工们研究了材料代用问题，钢材不足的困难克服了，基本上可以满足生产的需要。明年生产需要增添的新设备，也已经开始安装。
