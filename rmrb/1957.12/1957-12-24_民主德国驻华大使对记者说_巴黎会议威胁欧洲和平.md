Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd—The Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) to China, Gipner, told Chinese and foreign reporters in Beijing today, while introducing the GDR government's attitude towards some important international issues, that the resolutions made by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Paris meeting under American pressure threaten European peace and violate the vital interests of the German people.

The ambassador said at the press conference that the West German government is doing its best to support the aggressive policies of the United States, preparing to turn West Germany into an American rocket launch base, and equipping the West German army with atomic weapons. This cannot represent the will of the German people at all.

The ambassador distributed to the press conference the appeal from the People's Chamber of the GDR to the Federal Parliament of the Bonn government on the 11th of this month. The appeal suggested that the West German government reach a four-point agreement with the GDR government, including not setting up or storing atomic weapons and rocket weapons on German territory.

The ambassador severely condemned the West German government's refusal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone on German territory and expressed that the German people will heighten their vigilance and continue to strive for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone and against atomic war.

Ambassador Gipner spoke about the Indonesian people's struggle to recover West Irian at the meeting, saying that the GDR government is willing to provide the Indonesian people with extensive material support.

    据新华社23日讯　民主德国驻华大使纪普纳今天在向北京的中外记者介绍民主德国政府对一些重要国际问题的态度时指出，北大西洋集团巴黎会议在美国压力下所做出的各项决议，威胁着欧洲和平并违背德国人民的切身利益。
    大使在记者招待会上说，西德政府竭力支持美国的侵略政策，准备把西德变成美国的火箭发射基地，并用原子武器装备西德军队，这是完全不能代表德国人民的意志的。

    大使严厉地谴责了西德政府拒绝在德国领土上建立无原子武器区的行为，并且表示德国人民将提高警惕，为继续争取建立无原子武器区和反对原子战争而努力。
