Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 23rd. Su Mei, Chairman of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway Acceptance and Handover Committee, announced at the handover signing ceremony held in Chengdu on the 23rd that the final section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, from Baoji to Shangxiba Station in Guangyuan, Sichuan, fully meets the design standards, and the overall quality assessment of all projects is excellent and can be officially handed over to the state for use.

The Ministry of Railways has decided that the Baoji-Chengdu Railway will officially start operations on January 1, 1958.

The Baoji-Chengdu Railway is 668.36 kilometers long. The acceptance work for this railway was carried out in sections. As early as 1954 and 1955, the state respectively accepted the two sections of the line from Chengdu to Mianyang and from Mianyang to Shangxiba. The project quality of these two sections met national requirements. The section from Baoji to Shangxiba, which was accepted this time, is 346.8 kilometers long.

On the morning of the 23rd, the moderator of the ceremony, Su Mei, reported on the process of accepting the Baoji-Shangxiba section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway on behalf of the National Acceptance and Handover Committee, and read out the acceptance conclusion. The committee believes that the large-scale structures such as bridges and tunnels in the Baoji-Shangxiba section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway are strong and beautiful, the roadbed is stable, and the project quality is excellent; the layout of the stations and hub stations, the track distribution of the railway, and the station yard slopes all meet the regulations and usage requirements.

The report read by Su Mei also pointed out that the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is a magnificent project; especially the section from Baoji to Shangxiba, which runs across the three provinces of Sichuan, Gansu, and Shaanxi, crosses the Qinling Mountains, and passes through the Daba Mountains. Along the way, there are towering mountains, steep cliffs, winding canyons, and rapid rivers. The height difference of the line is large, and bridges and tunnels are densely distributed. The difficulty and complexity of the surveying, design, and construction of this railway are unprecedented in the history of railway construction in our country. However, thanks to the leadership of the Party, the support of the people of the whole country, and the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, more than 100,000 employees of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway creatively solved the difficult problems of design, construction, and disease control of the special and complex terrain and geology of this railway during the construction process, and completed the track laying of the entire line thirteen months ahead of the design plan; making the Shu Road no longer difficult and transforming perilous terrain into a smooth road. The completion of this railway has accumulated rich experience for our country's future construction of mountain railways.

After Su Mei's speech, the members of the National Acceptance and Handover Committee and the heads of the handover units signed the "General Report on Acceptance and Handover of the Baoji-Shangxiba Section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway."

Subsequently, Tong Shaosheng, Deputy Governor of Sichuan Province, Liu Shenghua, Deputy Director of the Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways representing the construction unit of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, Zhai Hecheng, Chief Engineer of the Second Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways representing the design unit of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, Hu Jingxiang, Director of the Chengdu Railway Administration representing the receiving party, and Zhao Cong, Director of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, spoke separately, expressing their agreement with the National Acceptance and Handover Committee's conclusion on the Baoji-Shangxiba section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway.

Representatives from the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee, the Transportation Work Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Chengdu Military Region, and more than 900 railway workers from various railway units in Chengdu also attended the handover signing ceremony.

    蜀道不再难　天险变坦途
    宝成路元旦正式通车
    国家验收结论：全部工程质量优良
    新华社成都23日电　宝成铁路验收交接委员会主任委员苏梅23日在成都举行的交接签字仪式上宣布，宝成铁路交付国家验收的宝鸡到四川广元上西坝车站最后一段线路，完全符合设计标准，全部工程的质量总评是优良的，可以交付国家正式使用。
    铁道部已经决定，宝成路将在1958年1月1日正式运营。
    宝成铁路全长六六八·三六公里。这条铁路的验收工作是分段进行的，早在1954年和1955年，国家就分别验收了成都到绵阳和绵阳到上西坝的两段线路。这两段线路的工程质量都符合国家要求。这次验收的宝鸡到上西坝的线路长三四六·八公里。
    23日上午，仪式主持人苏梅在会上代表国家验收交接委员会报告了对宝成铁路宝上段进行验收的经过情况，并且宣读了验收结论。委员会认为：宝成铁路宝上段的桥梁、隧道等大型建筑坚固美观，路基稳定，工程质量优良；车站和枢纽站的布置、铁路股道配线和站场坡度，也都符合规定和使用要求。
    苏梅宣读的报告还指出，宝成铁路的工程宏伟；特别是宝鸡到上西坝一段，横贯川、甘、陕三省，翻越秦岭高峰，穿过大巴山脉，沿途丛山峻岭，悬岩陡壁，峡谷曲折，河流湍急，线路的高差大，桥梁隧道密集，这条铁路的勘测设计和施工的艰巨复杂程度，在我国铁路修筑史上是空前的。但是，由于党的领导、全国人民的支援和苏联专家的无私帮助，宝成铁路十多万职工在修建过程中，创造性地解决了这条铁路地形地质特殊复杂的设计、施工、整治病害等困难问题，比设计方案提前十三个月完成了全线的铺轨任务；使蜀道不再难，天险变坦途。这条铁路的建成，为我国今后建筑山区铁路积累了丰富的经验。
    苏梅讲话以后，国家验收交接委员会各委员和各交接单位的负责人，分别在“宝成铁路宝鸡至上西坝段验收交接总报告”上签字。
    接着，四川省副省长童少生，交方的铁道部第二工程局副局长刘圣化代表宝成铁路施工单位，铁道部第二设计院总工程师翟鹤程代表宝成铁路设计单位，接方的成都铁路管理局局长胡景祥，郑州铁路管理局局长赵聪，分别讲话，表示同意国家验收交接委员会对宝成铁路宝上段工程的结论。
    参加交接签字仪式的，还有四川省人民委员会、陕西省人民委员会、中共四川省委交通工作部、成都军区等单位的代表，以及成都各铁路单位的九百多个铁路职工。
