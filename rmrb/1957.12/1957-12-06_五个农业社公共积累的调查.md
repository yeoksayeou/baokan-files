Investigation of Public Accumulation in Five Agricultural Cooperatives
　　Office of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhang Wenqi, Wang Ennyuan

Not long ago, we conducted a survey on the accumulation and consumption issues of five agricultural cooperatives. These five cooperatives are: Hongxing Cooperative in Anci County (cotton region), Hongqi Cooperative in Jinghai County (low-lying, flood-prone area), Dongduan Cooperative in Ba County (grain-producing area), Tongyi Cooperative in Jinghai County (garden area), and Fumin Cooperative in Jinghai County (paddy field area). These cooperatives, except for Hongqi Cooperative, are relatively consolidated, and the income of the members is also relatively high.

The distribution situation of these five cooperatives in 1956 and 1957 is as follows (1956 was affected by disaster, 1957 is the distribution draft).

　　Proportion of member distribution to total cooperative income: Proportion of public accumulation to total cooperative actual income:
Cooperative Name　1956 (%)　1957 (%)　1956 (%)　1957 (%)
　Hongxing Cooperative　64.42　78.52　1.5　4
　Hongqi Cooperative　76.88　67.2　1　5
　Dongduan Cooperative　52.88　53.25　4　7
　Tongyi Cooperative　64.79　65.22　6.5　7
　Fumin Cooperative　63.29　63.6　11.71　11.8

　　After the distribution in 1957, the proportion of households whose income increased compared to before joining the cooperative was 98.7% in Hongxing Cooperative, 89.8% in Hongqi Cooperative, 80% in Dongduan Cooperative, 95.24% in Tongyi Cooperative, and 94.6% in Fumin Cooperative.

A comparison of the average income per person and the required living expenses in the five cooperatives can be made as follows:

Cooperative Name　Annual Living Expenses per Person　Average Net Income per Person in 1956　Average Net Income per Person in 1957
Hongxing Cooperative　90.64 yuan　76.00 yuan　181.40 yuan
Hongqi Cooperative　64.84 yuan　27.87 yuan　82.62 yuan
Dongduan Cooperative　69.02 yuan　46.35 yuan　51.04 yuan
Tongyi Cooperative　90.64 yuan　87.96 yuan　104.89 yuan
Fumin Cooperative　88.96 yuan　82.29 yuan　106.10 yuan

From this survey, it can be seen that there is a tendency to neglect public accumulation among some cadres and members. Especially in the cooperatives in economic crop areas with higher incomes, although the proportion of public accumulation retained is higher than in other cooperatives, it is still relatively small compared to the proportion of increased income for the members. For example, the average net income per person in Tongyi Cooperative increased by 19.2% this year compared to last year, but the public accumulation only increased by 0.5%. The average net income per person in Hongxing Cooperative has nearly doubled this year compared to last year. Last year, due to the disaster and excessive expenses, 15,000 yuan of production expenses were transferred to the following year; however, this year, in the case of a bumper harvest, the plan is to only amortize 7,500 yuan of the 15,000 yuan transferred from the previous year, and leave the rest for amortization in 1958. Can't more be amortized this year? It is entirely possible. The public accumulation that this cooperative plans to retain this year only accounts for 21.48% of the total income, and it is estimated that each labor day can be distributed with 4.52 yuan. As a result of this distribution, 166 out of the 168 households in the cooperative can increase their income compared to before joining the cooperative (the bumper harvest of 1953), and only one rich peasant household and one wealthy middle peasant household will have reduced income. If all of the 15,000 yuan in arrears left over from last year are retained this year, the total retention ratio this year will only account for 25.3% of the total income, and even if more public accumulation is retained, each labor day can still be distributed with more than 4 yuan, and the vast majority of households can still increase their income.

　　　Reasons for hindering the growth of accumulation and issues to be noted

There are two factors affecting the expansion of public accumulation: one is the issue of ideological understanding. Some people have a one-sided understanding of the "less retention, more distribution" principle proposed last year, believing that the more is distributed to members, the better, without deeply understanding the significant significance of increasing public accumulation for the development of production. The second is the issue of financial management. Some cooperatives have excessive expenses, and although the proportion of public accumulation retained is not small, it can only offset the production expenses consumed (and sometimes even leave arrears), and the public accumulation is very small. If the retention ratio is further increased, it may affect the increase in income for the members.

In response to the above situation, in order to appropriately expand public accumulation, on the one hand, it is necessary to enable cooperative cadres and members to correct their understanding of accumulation and consumption, long-term interests and immediate interests, and correctly handle the relationship between these aspects. On the other hand, it is also necessary to pay attention to saving expenses and reducing production costs to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the principle of running cooperatives diligently and frugally.

Currently, the largest proportion of production expenditures in agricultural cooperatives is fertilizer costs and forage costs (especially in economic crop areas). Last year, fertilizer costs in Hongxing Cooperative accounted for 20.74% of the total agricultural output value, and forage costs accounted for 16.89%. After taking measures this year, they have been greatly reduced, with fertilizer costs accounting for 4.29% of the total agricultural output value and forage costs accounting for 3%. This year, fertilizer costs in Tongyi Cooperative accounted for 10.16% of the total agricultural output value, and forage costs accounted for 4.17%. The main reason for these high expenses is the neglect of the internal potential of the cooperative. Tongyi Cooperative has many gardens and a large demand for fertilizer, but the cooperative does not pay attention to accumulating fertilizer. Last year, the cooperative raised 24 pigs, but this year only raised two large pigs (still awarded by the government) and six piglets. For two years, no member households raised pigs. The leading cadres of the cooperative believe that the family fertilizer of the members "does not solve the problem" and are unwilling to purchase it, relying solely on purchasing commercial fertilizer. Last year, the cooperative spent a total of more than 11,000 yuan on fertilizer costs, accounting for 45.63% of the total agricultural expenditure, of which the fertilizer investment from members to the cooperative only amounted to more than 1,900 yuan. Hongxing Cooperative has already made achievements in saving expenses in this area this year. Last year, fertilizer costs in this cooperative accounted for 41.9% of the total agricultural expenditure, and chemical fertilizer alone accounted for 27.73% of the total agricultural expenditure. This year, a large number of pigs were raised to accumulate fertilizer, and labor was rationally organized to cut grass. As a result, fertilizer costs decreased by more than 8,000 yuan compared to last year, and forage costs also decreased a lot. Therefore, the total retention ratio this year was reduced from 35.58% last year to 21.48%. However, the potential of this cooperative has not been fully tapped. The planned number of pigs to be raised this winter will increase from the current 174 to 350, averaging more than two per household, and more green grass will be cut next year to strive for self-sufficiency in feed. It is estimated that in 1958, fertilizer costs can be reduced to 2.5% of the total agricultural output value. Tongyi Cooperative in the garden area also has all the conditions to reduce production costs like Hongxing Cooperative. In general grain-producing areas, under the conditions of continuous development of production, it is possible to make fertilizer costs account for 5%-8% of the total agricultural output value and forage costs account for 3%-7%.

　　　Accumulate production funds gradually according to possibilities

Tianjin Prefecture is continuing to vigorously carry out the transformation of low-lying production and the construction of water conservancy, and currently requires more funds. Under such circumstances, in addition to appropriately retaining public accumulation funds and public welfare funds, agricultural cooperatives should also retain enough production expenses needed for the following year as much as possible to meet production needs and prevent disasters. Fumin Cooperative has already done this. Last year, in addition to deducting 6% for public accumulation funds and 2% for public welfare funds, this cooperative also retained more than 45,300 yuan for production expenses for the following year. The three deductions accounted for 11.71% of the actual income. As a result of this distribution, the value of each labor day was 2.23 yuan, and the average net income per member was 82.29 yuan. 91.2% of the 2,478 households in the cooperative increased their income compared to before joining the cooperative. This year, 8% will still be deducted for public accumulation funds and public welfare funds, and 60,000 yuan will be retained for production expenses for the following year. The three deductions will account for 11.8% of the actual income. As a result of the distribution, the value of each labor day is 2.89 yuan, the average net income per member is 106.10 yuan, and 94.6% of the households have increased their income. In this way, this cooperative has basically gotten rid of the situation of "empty foundation" and financial difficulties. Currently, this cooperative has prepared half a set of production funds, and will be able to prepare a full set of production funds in one or two years, and the income of the members will also increase by about 25% year by year.

We in the Hongxing Cooperative in the cotton area have also calculated the accounts: if we still retain according to last year's proportion (deducting 35.58%) this year, the member distribution part will account for 64.42% of the total income, the value of each labor day will be 3.875 yuan, and the average net income per person will be 145.13 yuan. General members can increase their income compared to before joining the cooperative. It can be seen that deducting more than 35% does not have much impact on the income of the members. However, the cooperative's production funds can be increased a lot. In this way, the cooperative can prepare a full set of production funds in two years and two sets of production funds in three years. The income of the members can basically be guaranteed to grow by 25%-30% year by year.

　  五个农业社公共积累的调查
    中共天津地委办公室　张文奇　王恩元
    不久以前我们对五个农业社的积累和消费问题作了一次调查。这五个社是：安次县红星社（棉区）、静海县红旗社（低洼易涝区）、坝县东段社（粮产区）、静海县统一社（园田区）、静海县富民社（稻田区）。这些社除红旗社外都比较巩固，社员收入也较多。
    这五个社1956、1957年的分配情况如下（1956年受灾1957年是分配草案）。
    社员分配占全社总收入的比例：　公共积累占全社实际收入的比例：
  社　名　1956年（％）　1957年（％）　1956年（％）　1957年（％）
  红星社　64.42　78.52　1.5　4
  红旗社　76.88 　67.2　1　5 
  东段社　52.88　53.25　4　7
  统一社　64.79　65.22　6.5　7
  富民社　63.29　63.6　11.71　11.8
    1957年分配后，可比入社前增加收入的户，红星社占社员总数的98.7％，红旗社占89.8％，东段社占80％，统一社占95.24％，富民社占94.6％。
          五个社每人平均收入与所需生活费，可作如下的比较：社
　名每人每年实需生活费1956年每人平均纯收入1957年每人平均纯收入红星社　90.64元　76.00元　181.40元红旗社　64.84元　27.87元
　82.62元东段社　69.02元　46.35元　51.04元统一社　90.64元　87.96元　104.89元富民社　88.96元　82.29元　106.10元
    从这次调查看，在部分干部和社员中都存在着忽视公共积累的偏向。特别是经济作物区的收入较大的合作社，虽然扣留公共积累的比例较其它社多一些，但与社员增加收入的比例比较起来，还是嫌少了一些。例如统一社今年每人平均纯收入比去年增加19.2％，但公共积累只增加0.5％。红星社今年每人平均纯收入比去年增长近一倍半。去年由于遭灾，开支过大，曾把一万五千元的生产开支转入下年；但是，今年在丰收的情况下，才计划把上年度转来的那一万五千元摊入七千五百元，其余留给1958年摊。今年是否不能再多摊些呢？完全能够。这个社今年计划扣留的公共积累只占总收入的21.48％，预计每个劳动日可分四点五二元。这样分配的结果，全社一百六十八户中有一百六十六户可较入社前（丰收的1953年）增加收入，只有一户富农和一户富裕中农减少收入。如果把去年留下的一万五千元亏欠全部在今年扣留，今年总的扣留比例才占总收入的25.3％，即使再多扣点公共积累，每个劳动日仍可分四元以上，绝大多数的户仍能增加收入。
      影响积累增长的原因和应注意的问题
    影响公共积累扩大的因素有二：一是思想认识问题。有些人对于去年提出的“少扣多分”原则有片面理解，认为给社员越多分越好，没有深切地了解到增加公共积累对于发展生产的重大意义。二是财务管理问题。有些社由于开支过大，虽然公共积累扣留的比例不算小，但只能抵顶消耗掉的生产费（有时还拖下尾欠），公共积累则为数很少，如果再增加扣留比例，就可能影响社员增加收入。
    针对以上的情况，为了适当地扩大公共积累，一方面须要使社干部和社员端正对积累和消费、长远利益和眼前利益的认识，正确地处理这些方面的关系。另一方面还须要注意根据勤俭办社的原则，尽最大努力节省开支降低生产成本。
    目前在农业社的生产支出中占比重最大的是肥料费和草料费两项（尤其是经济作物区）。红星社去年肥料费占农业总产值的20.74％，草料费占16.89％。今年采取措施后大大减缩了，肥料费占农业总产值的4.29％，草料费占3％。统一社今年肥料费占农业总产值的10.16％，草料费占4.17％。这两项开支大的主要原因，是忽视合作社内部潜力。统一社园田多，需肥量大，但社里对积肥不重视。去年全社养猪二十四口，今年只养大猪两口（还是政府奖给的）、小猪六口。两年来社员没有一户养猪。合作社的领导干部认为社员的家庭肥料“不解决问题”，不愿意收买，单纯依靠购买商品肥料。这个社去年共开支肥料费一万一千多元，占农业总支出的45.63％，其中社员向社投资的肥料折款仅一千九百多元。红星社在今年节约这方面的开支已经做出成绩。这个社去年肥料费占农业开支总数的41.9％，仅化学肥料就占农业开支总数的27.73％。今年大量养猪积肥，并且合理地组织劳力打草。结果，肥料费比去年减少八千多元，草料费也减少了很多。因此，今年扣留总比例由去年的35.58％降低为21.48％。但是，这个社的潜力并没有挖尽，今冬计划养猪数字由现有的一百七十四口增加到三百五十口，平均每户两口以上，明年再多打些青草，争取作到饲草自足。预计1958年肥料费可降低到占农业总产值的2.5％。园田区的统一社也完全有条件像红星社一样降低生产成本。在一般粮产区，在生产不断发展的条件下，做到肥料费占农业总产值的5％—8％，草料费占3％—7％，是可能的。
          根据可能，逐步储备生产资金
    天津专区正在继续大力进行洼地生产改革和兴修水利，目前更需要较多的资金。在这样情况下，农业社今后除了适当地扣留公积金和公益金以外，还应该尽可能留够下一年所需要的生产费，以应生产需要和防备灾荒。富民社已经这样作了。这个社去年除扣公积金6％、公益金2％以外，还扣留下年生产费四万五千三百多元，三项扣留共占实际收入的11.71％。这样分配的结果，每个劳动日值为二点二三元，社员每人平均纯收入八十二元二角九分。全社二千四百七十八户中91.2％的户比入社前增加了收入。今年仍扣公积金公益金8％，扣下年生产费六万元，三项共占实际收入的11.8％。分配的结果，每个劳动日值二元八角九分，社员每人平均纯收入一百零六元一角，94.6％的户增加了收入。这样，这个社基本上摆脱了“底子空”、资金困难的局面。目前这个社已备有半套生产资金，一、二年后即可备足一套生产资金，而社员的收入也将逐年增加25％左右。
    我们在棉区的红星社也算了一笔账：今年如果仍然按照去年的比例（扣35.58％）扣留，社员分配部分占总收入的64.42％，每个劳动日值三元八角七分五，平均每人纯收入一百四十五元一角三分。一般社员都能比入社前增加收入。可见扣35％以上对社员收入并没有多少影响。但社内的生产资金则可增加许多。这样，该社在二年内即可备足一套生产资金，三年内即可备足两套生产资金。社员收入，基本上能够保证逐年增长25％——30％。
