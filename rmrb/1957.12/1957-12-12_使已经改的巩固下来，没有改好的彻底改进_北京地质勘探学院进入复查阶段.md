Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch: Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration, having processed 78% of the opinions raised by the masses, has entered a stage of in-depth rectification and comprehensive review. This is one of the earliest schools in Beijing's institutions of higher learning to launch the rectification movement and the first to begin review work.
    The school's CPC Committee, at a recent joint meeting of standing committee members and general branch secretaries, assessed the current rectification situation. The meeting held that the previous stage of rectification had achieved great results, but the corrections were not ruthless or thorough enough. In order to consolidate what has been improved and thoroughly improve what has not been improved, and to propose handling opinions on some major issues, it was decided to conduct a comprehensive review while continuing to deepen the rectification.
    Soon after the review began, it was discovered that some past work had been corrected very crudely and procrastinated a lot, and some departments even treated rectification with a bureaucratic and formalistic attitude. For example, students requested the addition of spittoons in front of the dining hall, which could have been resolved immediately, but the relevant departments said they needed to study it before resolving it. For some problems that could not be resolved immediately, the masses were not clearly informed in the reply, which caused dissatisfaction among the masses. For example, when the Party Committee responded to the masses' questions about strengthening the ideological education of employees and giving full play to the role of the broadcasting room, it simply said, "Pay attention in the future." It did not come up with specific ways to improve, and it did not convene relevant personnel for research afterwards.
    The review also found that some issues were not combined with ideological education, so that the problems were not solved deeply and thoroughly, resulting in the phenomenon of "old habits recurring." For example, the problem of students owing meal fees, during the rectification upsurge, fell from a total of 9,000 yuan to several hundred yuan, but because the ideological education work was not detailed enough, individual students who owed meal fees for no reason were not dealt with in time, so in November, the arrears of meal fees reached more than 4,000 yuan. After this review, the canteen and other units believed that they should first start with ideological education and at the same time establish necessary systems.
    Some units have also solved some new problems in the review. After a joint meeting of various departments of general affairs, it was considered possible to restore the "two-part system" that had been implemented for meals to a "one-part system." The school's student dining hall can only accommodate more than 2,000 people, but more than 5,000 people eat at the same time, so it was changed to a "two-part system." However, after the implementation of the "two-part system," many shortcomings were found: such as "second part" students leaving class late, squeezing out time for recreational activities and social work, and "first part" and "second part" students interfering with each other due to different schedules. During the review process, they consulted with the trade union and changed the faculty and staff club into a dining hall for faculty and staff, and vacated the original faculty and staff dining hall and nearby workers' dormitories, which could solve the problem of dining places for 5,000 people. The construction of this new dining hall has now begun. In addition, many problems such as the extension of clinic hours in the infirmary and the lack of places for faculty and staff to take showers have also been resolved in the review.
    Now, all departments of the school have generally begun to check the rectification situation item by item, and have been welcomed by the masses. Some teachers said: The Party Committee's report said that nearly 80% of the opinions have now been resolved, and I am very satisfied, but the Party Committee is still not satisfied and must be thoroughly resolved, which shows that the Party Committee's determination to rectify the work style is very great.
    The school's review work is scheduled to end in about two to three weeks.

### 使已经改的巩固下来，没有改好的彻底改进  北京地质勘探学院进入复查阶段

　　使已经改的巩固下来，没有改好的彻底改进
    北京地质勘探学院进入复查阶段
    新华社11日讯　北京地质勘探学院在处理了群众所提意见的78％的基础上，已经进入深入整改、全面复查阶段。这是北京高等学校中整风运动开展较早、最先开始复查工作的一个学校。
    这个学校的中共党委在最近举行的常委和总支书记联席会议上，对当前整改情况作了估计。会议认为前一阶段的整改是有很大成绩的，但改得还不够狠、不够彻底。为了使已改进的巩固下来，未改好的彻底改进，一些重大的问题能提出处理意见，因此决定一面进行全面复查，一面继续深入整改。
    在开始复查不久，已发现过去有些工作改得很粗糙，很拖拉，有的部门甚至以官僚主义、形式主义态度对待整改。比如学生们要求在大饭厅前增设痰盂，本来马上可以解决，但有关部门说要研究研究再来解决。对于有些不可能立即解决的问题，在答复时也没有向群众交代清楚，以致群众感到不满。如党委会答复群众提出的关于加强职工的思想教育和发挥广播室的作用问题时，只简单地说：“今后注意”，究竟如何注意改进，没有拿出具体办法，而以后也没有召集有关人员进行研究。
    复查中还发现有些问题没有结合进行思想教育，以致问题解决得不深不透，造成“旧病重犯”的现象。如学生欠交膳费问题，在整改高潮时从欠交总数九千元下降到几百元，但由于思想教育工作做得不够细致，对个别无故欠交膳费的学生没有及时处理，因而11月份欠交膳费又达四千多元。这次复查以后，膳食科等单位认为首先要从思想教育方面着手，同时订立必要的制度。
    有些单位在复查中还解决了一些新的问题。总务方面的各个科联合召开了会议以后，认为有可能把吃饭等方面已实行的“二部制”恢复为“一部制”。这个学校的学生饭厅只能容纳二千多人，但同时用膳的有五千多人，因此改为“二部制”。但是实行“二部制”以后，发现有很多缺点：如“第二部”学生下课晚，挤掉了文娱活动和社会工作的时间，“一部”和“二部”学生由于作息时间不同，相互干扰等等。复查过程中，他们同工会协商，把教工俱乐部改为教职工的饭厅，原教职工的饭厅和附近的工人宿舍腾出来，就可以解决五千人用膳的场所问题。现在这个新饭厅修建工作已经开始了。此外如医务室延长门诊时间，教职员没有地方洗澡等许多问题也都在复查中得到解决。
    现在，这个学校各部门普遍开始逐条检查整改的情况，而且受到了群众的欢迎。有的教师说：党委会的报告中说现在解决的意见已近80％，我已经很满意了，但党委还不满意，一定要彻底解决，由此可见党委整风的决心是很大的。
    这个学校的复查工作预定两周到三周左右的时间结束。
