Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 8th. Comrade Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a report on the current domestic and international situation and tasks at the Second Session of the First Congress of the CPC Henan Provincial Committee, which was recently held. During the meeting, he also held several symposiums with the responsible comrades of the provincial and regional committees, and gave instructions on how the Party committees should lead the current agricultural production upsurge.

In analyzing the characteristics of the current agricultural production upsurge, Tan Zhenlin pointed out: Our rural work is entering a new period, and the agricultural production upsurge is developing in depth on an unprecedented scale. This upsurge has arisen on the following basis: First, collectivization has been basically realized; second, collectivization has two years of experience in production and construction; third, the socialist education movement of extensive airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters has been carried out in rural areas. Our various tasks have generated new forces on such a political, ideological, and material basis, forming the current production upsurge.

Tan Zhenlin said: This production upsurge is breaking through all right-leaning conservative obstacles with tremendous force and is moving forward. In Henan, more than 10 million laborers have already been投入 into water conservancy construction and manure accumulation, greatly exceeding the scale of 1956. The current issue is how Party committees at all levels can seize this upsurge, so that the guiding ideology conforms to the current objective reality, and does not lag behind the situation. The sooner a place seizes the current favorable situation and the more quickly it correctly organizes the enthusiasm of the masses, the more vigorous and forward-leaping the work of that place will be; otherwise, it will put itself in a passive position.

Tan Zhenlin systematically explained the issue of how Party committees should lead the current production:

One, be good at grasping both ends and driving the middle. In the process of implementing the First Five-Year Plan, some counties increased production by one or more times, and have already met the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft); some counties increased production by 80% or 60%, but some counties did not complete the targets of the First Five-Year Plan, and individual counties even reduced production. Why is this? We should study the reasons and find out the laws of increasing or decreasing production. Those who have achieved success in increasing production should be commended, while those who have reduced production should be supervised and helped. Why have others increased production while you have reduced production? You blame poor natural conditions. Of course, natural conditions are related, but the facts prove that this is not the determining factor. You say that you are a low-lying, flood-prone area. Isn't Huaibin County a low-lying, flood-prone area? They have not reduced production; on the contrary, they have transformed the low-lying areas and greatly increased production. You say that you are a barren mountainous area. Isn't Linxian County a large mountainous area? There, 280,000 people have no water to drink and are extremely poor, but they have developed the mountainous areas, overcome difficulties, and increased production. You say that you are a sandy wasteland or saline-alkali land. Sandy wasteland and saline-alkali land have also increased production by one or two times. In short, it depends on human effort. The same conditions, plus subjective effort, will yield different results. The leadership should be good at discovering problems from the imbalance of things and solving them. Many experiences have proven that as long as the Party committee seriously grasps the lagging areas, they can quickly catch up, and even get ahead.

Two, seize typical examples in a timely manner, help them develop in an all-round way, and establish banners. In the movement, a group of advanced units will emerge, which have a wide scope of activities, better solve various policy issues, and make faster progress in their work. The leadership should seize these units, issue circulars of commendation, and at the same time help them develop in an all-round way to establish typical examples. For example, the experience of Jiyuan in harnessing the Mang River is very good, but it lacks experience in grasping other measures to increase production. It should be helped to supplement this aspect, such as raising pigs, accumulating manure, improving agricultural tools, and popularizing fine seeds. The experience of Hong'an County in Hubei is more comprehensive, with water conservancy, fertilizer, planting, cultivation techniques, and large-scale high-yield typical examples. Comparing this experience with the experience of Jiyuan, the experience of Jiyuan seems insufficient.

Three, Henan has a good method, which is to air views on whatever is being done, debate whatever is being done, which is a good method of adhering to the mass line. You suffered a great flood and drought this year. It was originally estimated that there would not be enough grain to eat, and it was necessary to ask the central government for 500 million jin to survive. However, after a large-scale grain debate, you over-fulfilled the state task by 350 million jin, and also compressed sales, so you may no longer need to ask the central government for assistance. This is a great achievement. Every year, agricultural loans are always recovered very little. To collect more, there will be coercion and commandism. This year, through a large-scale debate, 60 to 70 million yuan were quickly recovered, exceeding any previous year, which is a great help to the development of this year's agricultural production. Through large-scale debates on water conservancy construction and manure accumulation, people's thinking has been clarified, and the movement has been carried out vigorously. Yuxian County plans to complete the 827 square kilometers of soil and water conservation tasks originally scheduled to be completed within five years in one year this year. This is the result of conducting large-scale airing of views and great debates, calculating large accounts, calculating detailed accounts, and carrying out debates at the county's water conservancy conference. If they implement this method in each township and cooperative, then they can give full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the masses, and it is entirely possible to complete the tasks ahead of schedule and over-fulfill the tasks. Without the mass line method of large-scale airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters, presenting facts, and reasoning, the movement may also be launched, but coercion and commandism, formalism, slow progress, and low quality will inevitably occur. And these are all things we should prevent in advance.

Four, to make the movement develop in depth and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, the leadership must prevent the idea of being satisfied with the status quo of the movement, thinking that the scale has already exceeded 1956, and that it is almost enough. The comrades in Xinxiang Prefecture provided such an experience: After various mobilization meetings, the enthusiasm of the masses was high, and after large-scale airing of views, the confidence of the masses was even greater. Helping the masses to make concrete plans themselves made the masses more conscious. If cadres and Party members take the lead by setting an example, leading the masses to扫除 all obstacles in the advancement, and discovering and solving problems at any time, then our movement can be carried out more healthily and more deeply.

Five, advocate cadres to participate in production and lead production, personally engage in experimental fields with old farmers, and create high-yield typical examples, so that our comrades can truly understand the laws of agricultural production, in order to better lead agricultural production. Your Runan County, Neihuang County, and Xixia County have all gained experience in this regard. Eight cadres from Runan County were sent down to the Guangming Cooperative, personally participating in labor production, so that the grain output of this cooperative increased by 246% compared with last year, and cotton increased by one time more than the surrounding cooperatives. The deputy captain of the Liangzhuang District Working Team in Neihuang County cultivated six and a half mu of millet, one and a half mu of which reached a yield of 1,004 jin per mu. These experiences should be summarized and promoted, and cadres at all levels below the county should be called upon to learn. There are 400,000 middle and primary school students and 130,000 cadres sent down participating in agricultural production in Henan. It is not enough for them to be just ordinary farmers. They have a higher level of education or political level. They should be called upon to sum up the existing experience of farmers in the process of learning farmers' production experience, and use their own labor to create excellent production results, in order to drive the whole cooperative to strive for high yield.

Finally, Tan Zhenlin also talked about the need to be realistic and oppose blind empty talk in leading the current agricultural production upsurge; it is necessary to adapt to local conditions and prevent the rigid application of experiences that are not suitable for one's own region; it is necessary to pay attention to the development of diverse economies, and not to grasp the main and lose the secondary; it is necessary to pay attention to the coordination of various tasks, and all departments should vigorously support the current agricultural production upsurge.

    农业生产高潮正以雷霆万钧之势向前发展
    各级党委不要落在形势后面
    谭震林同志在中共河南党代会上谈如何领导当前农业生产高潮问题
    新华社郑州8日电　中共中央书记处书记谭震林同志在最近举行的中共河南省第一届代表大会第二次会议上作了目前国内外形势和任务的报告，并在会议期间，和省、地委的负责同志进行了几次座谈，对党委如何领导当前农业生产高潮问题作了指示。
    谭震林在分析当前农业生产高潮的特点时指出：我们的农村工作正在进入一个新的时期，农业生产的高潮正以空前的规模在深入地发展。这个高潮是在这样的基础上兴起来的：第一、基本上实现了合作化；第二、合作化已经有了两年生产和建设的经验；第三、农村进行了大鸣大放大辩论的社会主义教育运动。我们的各项工作在这样的政治、思想和物质基础上产生了新的力量，形成了当前的生产高潮。
    谭震林说：这个生产高潮正以雷霆万钧之势冲破一切右倾保守的障碍向前发展。河南目前已经有一千万以上的劳动力投入了兴修水利和积肥运动，大大超过了1956年的规模。目前的问题是各级党委如何抓住这个高潮，使领导思想符合于当前的客观实际，而不要落在形势的后面。那个地方愈早地抓住当前的有利形势，愈迅速地把群众的积极性正确组织起来，那个地方的工作就愈生气勃勃，向前跃进；否则，就会使自己陷于被动。
    谭震林系统地说明了党委如何领导当前生产的问题：
    一、要善于抓住两头，带动中间。在第一个五年计划执行过程中，有的县增产一倍或一倍以上，已经达到了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的要求，有的县增产80％、60％，但有的县却没有完成第一个五年计划的指标，个别县甚至减产了。为什么呢？应当去研究其原因，找出增产或减产的规律。对增产有成绩的应加以表扬，对减产的则应加以督促帮助。为什么人家增产你却减了产？你怪自然条件不好，当然，自然条件有关系，但事实证明这并不是决定因素。你说你是低洼易涝地区，淮滨县不是低洼易涝地区吗？人家却没有减产，相反，他们改造了洼地，大大增了产。你说你是贫瘠山区，林县不是大山区吗？他们那里二十八万人没有水吃，穷得要死，但他们却开发了山区，克服了困难，增加了生产。你说你是沙荒、盐碱地，沙荒、盐碱地也有增产一倍、两倍的。总之，事在人为，同样的条件加上主观努力就会得到不同的结果。领导上要善于从事物发展的不平衡中去发现问题，加以解决。许多经验证明，落在后面的地区，只要党委认真去抓，很快就可以跟上来，甚至赶到前面去的。
    二、要及时抓住典型，加以帮助，使其全面发展，树立旗帜。在运动当中，会出现一批先进的单位，他们动的面广，各项政策问题解决得较好，工作的进度较快。领导上就应当抓住这些单位，加以通报表扬，同时帮助他全面发展，以树立典型。如济源治理漭河的经验是很好的，但它还缺乏抓其它增产措施的经验，应当帮助它补足这方面，如养猪、积肥、改良农具，推广良种等等。湖北红安县的经验就比较全面，有水利、有肥料、有种植、有耕作技术、有大面积丰产典型。拿这个经验来和济源的经验比较，济源的经验就嫌不足了。
    三、河南有条好办法，就是做什么鸣放什么，辩论什么，这是坚持群众路线的好方法。你们今年遭了很大的水旱灾，原来预计粮食不够吃的，向中央要五亿斤才能过日子，但一经过粮食大辩论，就超额三亿五千万斤完成了国家任务，又压缩了销量，可能不再向中央要了，这是很大的成绩。每年农贷总是收回很少，要多收就发生强迫命令现象，今年通过大辩论，很快就收起六、七千万元，超过以往任何一年，这对发展今年的农业生产是一个很大的帮助。兴修水利和积肥运动，通过大辩论，弄通了思想，就轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。禹县计划要把在原定五年内完成的八百二十七平方公里的水土保持任务，在今年一年内完成，就是在县的水利会议上通过了大放大鸣、算大账、算细账，开展争论的结果。如果他们把这个方法贯彻到各乡、各社去，那么，就可以充分发挥群众的主动性，积极性，就完全可能提前和超额完成任务。不用大放大鸣大辩大争、摆事实、讲道理一套群众路线的方法，运动也可能搞起来，但必然会出现强迫命令、形式主义、进度慢、质量低等毛病。而这些都是我们事先就应当防止的。
    四、要使运动深入发展，充分发挥群众的积极性、创造性，领导上必须防止满足运动现状的想法，以为规模已经超过了1956年，差不多了。新乡专区的同志提供了这么一条经验：经过各种动员大会，群众情绪高了，再经过大放大鸣，群众的信心更大了，帮助群众自己动手做出了具体规划，群众的自觉性就更高了。如果干部、党员再以身作则一带头，率领群众扫除一切前进中的障碍，随时发现问题、解决问题，那么我们的运动就可以搞得更健康、更深入。
    五、提倡干部参加生产领导生产，亲自和老农一道搞试验田，搞丰产典型，使我们的同志真正懂得农业生产的规律，以便更好地领导农业生产。你们汝南县、内黄县、西峡县都已取得这方面的经验。汝南县有八个干部下放到光明社，亲自参加劳动生产，使这个社的粮食产量比去年增加了246％，棉花比周围的社增产一倍。内黄县梁庄区工作队的副队长搞了六亩半谷子，其中有一亩半达到亩产一千零四斤。这些经验应当总结起来加以推广，号召县以下的各级干部学习。河南参加农业生产的中小学生有四十万人，下放干部十三万人，他们如果只做一个普通的农民是不够的，他们有较高的文化水平或政治水平，应当号召他们在学习农民的生产经验的过程中，把农民已有的经验总结起来，用自己的劳动创造出优异的生产成绩，以带动全社争取丰产。
    最后，谭震林还谈到了在领导当前农业生产高潮中要注意实事求是，反对盲目空喊；要因地制宜，防止硬搬不适合自己地区情况的经验；要注意发展多种经济，不要抓住主要的丢了次要的；要注意各方面工作的配合，各部门都要大力支援当前的农业生产高潮。
