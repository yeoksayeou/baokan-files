    World Firsts in Soviet Industrial Production
    Blast Furnace with Unique Steam Cooling System
    The world's first blast furnace with a unique cooling system has been built in a steel factory in Stalino, Donbas.
    The special feature of this blast furnace is that it uses boiling water for cooling, which can extend the service life of the cooled components by four times and reduce water consumption to one-sixtieth of the original amount.
    This blast furnace is the sixth new blast furnace installed in Ukrainian steel factories in the past year and nine months. Thanks to the commissioning of the first five blast furnaces, Ukraine's annual iron production has increased by 2.7 million tons.
    The World's Largest Excavator
    The ЭЩ—25/100 excavator produced by the Ural Machine Factory in the Soviet Union is the world's largest excavator. Its productivity is twice as high as that of the largest excavator previously manufactured in Britain. This new type of excavator can excavate 1,500 cubic meters of earth per hour.
    This new type of excavator is used for stripping work in open-pit mines. It has a hoisting bucket with a capacity of 25 cubic meters, which can transport soil to a height equivalent to more than ten stories. This excavator also has a 100-meter-long arm, can excavate to a depth of more than 40 meters, and can transport the soil to a place 100 meters away from the working face. Although this machine is very large, it only requires one person to operate.
    Mobile Gantry Crane
    The world's largest mobile gantry crane has been successfully designed in the Soviet Union.
    This crane is 26 meters long, as tall as a six-story building, and can lift 1,300 tons.
    This crane was designed for the Krasnoyarsk Hydropower Station and will be manufactured at the New Kramatorsk Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant in Donbas.
    Device for Continuous Casting of Steel Billets Using Steel Ladles
    Currently, the Soviet Union is manufacturing the world's largest device for continuous casting of steel billets using 140-ton steel ladles. This device consists of four machines, and its production process, from the handling of steel ladles to the delivery of finished steel billets, is highly automated.
    Previously, the Soviet Union used 10-ton to 50-ton steel ladles for continuous casting of steel billets, while the largest continuous casting device in other countries used only 35-ton steel ladles.
    This set of equipment will be installed in the Stalin Factory in Donbas. After it is put into production, it will change the technological process of the factory's rolling mill and open-hearth furnace workshop, and can save the factory 400,000 tons of steel billets per year.
    The World's First Concrete Bridge
    Components of a huge concrete bridge are being manufactured in a factory near Moscow. Manufacturing the entire bridge structure from concrete is a groundbreaking innovation in the history of bridge construction. In the past, bridge components were made of steel.
    This huge concrete bridge weighs 30,000 tons, is approximately two kilometers long, and is 24 meters wide.
    This bridge will be built over the Moscow River under Lenin Hills. Not far from the north end of the bridge is Moscow University, and at the south end is the Lenin Central Stadium.
    Subway tracks will be laid on the glazed lower level of this bridge, and the "Lenin Hills" subway station will also be located here. (Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联工业生产中的世界第一
    带有独特蒸汽冷却系统的高炉
    世界第一座带有独特冷却系统的高炉已经在顿巴斯斯大林诺城的一座钢铁工厂建成。
    这座高炉的特点是用开水冷却，这可以使被冷却的构件的使用期限延长四倍，而且用水减少到原来用水的六十分之一。
    这座高炉是乌克兰各钢铁工厂在最近一年零九个月中安装的第六座新高炉。由于前五座高炉的投入生产，乌克兰每年的炼铁量增加了二百七十万吨。
    世界最大的掘土机
    苏联乌拉尔机器工厂开始生产的ЭЩ—25／100型的掘土机是世界上最大的掘土机。它的生产率比英国在这以前制造的世界上最大的掘土机还高一倍。这种新型的掘土机每小时能够掘土一千五百立方公尺。
    这种新型掘土机是在开采露天矿进行剥离工作时使用的。它有一个容量达二十五立方公尺的升运斗，能够把土运到十多层楼房那样高的地方去。这种掘土机还有一个长一百公尺的臂，掘土的深度能够达到四十公尺以上，还能把土运到离开工作面一百公尺的地方。这个机器虽然很大，但是只需要一个人操纵。
    移动式构台起重机
    世界最大的移动式构台起重机已经在苏联设计成功。
    这架起重机长二十六公尺，有六层楼那么高，能起重一千三百吨。
    这个起重机是为克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站设计的，将在顿巴斯的新克拉马托尔斯克重型机器制造厂制造。
    用钢水罐连续浇铸钢坯的装置
    目前，苏联正在制造世界上最大的、用一百四十吨的钢水罐连续浇铸钢坯的装置。这个装置由四部机器组成，它的生产过程从操纵钢水罐到发送制好的钢坯，都实行了最大程度的自动化。
    以前，苏联连续浇铸钢坯是用十吨到五十吨的钢水罐，而其它国家最大的连续浇钢装置所用的钢水罐只有三十五吨。
    这套装置将安装在顿巴斯的斯大林工厂。它在投入生产后，将改变这个工厂的轧钢车间和平炉车间的工艺过程，并且能使这个工厂每年节省四十万吨的钢坯。
    世界第一座混凝土桥
    一座巨大的混凝土桥的构件正在莫斯科近郊的一个工厂里制造。用混凝土制造整个桥的构件是世界桥梁建筑史上的一个创举。过去，桥的构件是用钢制成的。
    这座巨大的混凝土桥重三万吨，长约二公里，宽二十四公尺。
    这座桥将架设在列宁山下的莫斯科河上。在桥的北头不远的地方是莫斯科大学，南头是列宁中央运动场。
    在这座桥的镶着玻璃的下层将敷设地下铁轨，“列宁山”地下车站也将设在这里。（新华社）
