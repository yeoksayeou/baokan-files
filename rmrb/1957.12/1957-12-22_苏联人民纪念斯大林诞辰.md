    苏联人民纪念斯大林诞辰
    据新华社莫斯科21日电  今天是约·维·斯大林诞生七十八周年纪念日。莫斯科各报发表了一些新闻，报道在斯大林生前曾经工作过和生活过的地方人们纪念这位伟大的马克思列宁主义革命家的诞辰的活动情况。“真理报”还发表了一篇题为“在斯大林的故乡”的通讯。
    来自格鲁吉亚的消息说，这几天来，人们纷纷前往共和国首都第比利斯，参观那里的和斯大林的革命活动有关的地点。参观者在列宁中央博物馆格鲁吉亚分馆观看了许多陈列品，这些陈列品证明伟大的列宁所建立和教养起来的布尔什维克党的光荣历史，证明苏联人民在实现列宁的关于在苏联建设社会主义的计划中所获得的历史性胜利，这些胜利是在苏联共产党和多年来以斯大林为首的党中央委员会的领导下获得的。
    在斯大林的诞生地——哥里，这几天来越来越多的人前往瞻仰斯大林诞生并且度过他的童年的那座小屋子。
