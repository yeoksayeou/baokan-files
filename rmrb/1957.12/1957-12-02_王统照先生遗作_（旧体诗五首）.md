Mr. Wang Tongzhao's posthumous works (Five Old-Style Poems)

　　Sitting by the Green Bay in Lüjia Village, Ju County - An Impromptu Verse
　　(February 29, 1952) Willows densely surround the bay like clouds, Fish nibble and break the water's pattern. Vegetable gardens are green, fields of wheat are lush. Birds chirp merrily in the clearing sky.

　　Travel Notes from Jining
    (Early Autumn, 1952) Hoisting sails and dropping locks by the Grand Canal, The past prosperity is still spoken of. This is the cultural heart of Lu, Where hundreds of craftsmen work to the tune of song.

　　Inscribing the reprinted edition of "Mountain Rain" for my son, Jicheng,
　　and his wife, Chaoqun (Spring 1955) The desolate scene of falling leaves in the ninth month, With the enemy entering Liaoyang, urgent beacon fires were lit. As a scholar, I am ashamed of my inability to serve the country, So I worry about writing a novel. Dim winds and rain over the sea and mountains, The lights of loved ones amidst the dense falling leaves. This is the time when the first frost arrives, And the grim ice transforms into a clear autumn. External difficulties arose opportunely coupled with internal strife and destruction, "The Yellow River has arrived" is a testament to resolute will. Wielding hoes and plows, there is no enemy in front, And after twenty years, regaining control.

The last line of the second poem refers to the large-scale invasion of China Proper by the Japanese several years later. The second line of the third poem borrows the common saying "One will not give up until the Yellow River is reached" to indicate that the reactionaries were at the end of the road, while the people rose up to resist with one heart.

　　王统照先生遗作　（旧体诗五首）
　　莒县吕家庄绿湾小坐口号
  （一九五二年二月二十九日）绕湾榆柳密如云，唼喋游鱼破水纹。菜圃绿分田麦旺。弄晴鸟雀叫纷纷。
　　济宁纪行
    （一九五二年初秋）挂帆落闸运河边，当日繁华尚语传。此是鲁中文化域，百工兴作配歌弦。
　　题重印本“山雨”与儿子济诚
　  其妇超群（一九五五年春）落木櫹槮九月天，辽阳敌入急烽烟。书生报国惭无力，把笔愁为说部篇。晦冥风雨海山头，灯火亲人落木稠。此是寒霜初履候，坚冰阴惨变清秋。外难乘时内迫残，“黄河已到”愿心坚。挺竿锄耰无前敌，二十年来复掌间。
    第二首末句指日军后数年大举侵入关内。第三首第二句借用俗语“不到黄河心不死”，以示反动派的日暮途穷，终到末路，而人民奋起同心反抗。
