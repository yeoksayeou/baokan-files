Xinhua News Agency, 23rd Dispatch: Xinhua News Agency reporter learned from the Second National Soil and Water Conservation Work Conference: China's soil and water conservation work has made tremendous achievements. According to preliminary statistics up to now, soil and water conservation measures have been implemented on more than 195,000 square kilometers of soil erosion areas, accounting for more than 13% of the total soil erosion area of 1.5 million square kilometers in China. In many places where soil erosion was severe in the past, new scenes of soil not washing downhill, mud not leaving the gully, and fine streams flowing constantly in the rivers have emerged.

The realization of agricultural cooperativization in China has enabled soil and water conservation work to enter a new stage, and the broad masses have shown great power in the struggle against nature. In the middle reaches of the Yellow River, since liberation, the area of preliminary control completed is about 78,000 square kilometers. Among them, from 1956 to September 1957, the area of preliminary control completed was more than 53,000 square kilometers. The workload of this one year and nine months is equivalent to more than twice the total workload of the past six years. The Mang River basin began to be managed after liberation, but before the winter of 1955, due to the limitations of the individual economy, the management project progressed very slowly. After the realization of cooperativization, the broad masses launched a movement of "hundred reservoirs, thousand wells, ten thousand water cellars." In just over a year of agricultural cooperativization, the amount of afforestation and small reservoir construction alone exceeded more than five times the total amount of projects in previous years before cooperativization. The nationally famous Daquanshan Agricultural Cooperative has completed the control of soil erosion area of 16,855 mu in the two years after cooperativization, accounting for 63% of the total area to be managed by the cooperative. Zhang Fenglin and Gao Jincai of this cooperative, although they worked hard for eighteen years, only managed a total of 447 mu.

The large-scale soil and water conservation work throughout the country has begun to play a significant role in improving mountain production, changing the natural appearance of mountain areas, and reducing water and drought disasters. After closing the mountains for afforestation and planting trees on 220,000 mu in the upstream mountainous area of the Mang River basin, more than 10 million cubic meters of rainwater have been intercepted. Now, when there is continuous rainfall of 10 mm, the ground does not get wet; when there is 30 mm, the water does not wash downhill; when there is 50 to 100 mm, clear water flows out after three days. Now the masses say: "No water is seen three days after rain, and the water flows constantly after many days of drought." Shaanxi Province has initially controlled the soil erosion area of more than 19,000 square kilometers in recent years, and it is estimated that an average of more than 50 million tons of sediment can be prevented from flowing into the Yellow River every year. In the mountainous areas of Guangdong, the phenomenon of soil erosion in collapsed mountain mouths is very serious. After Wuhua County, Guangdong, used various engineering measures and biological measures to manage many collapsed mountain valleys and edges, significant results have been achieved. The annual rice yield of this county has been increasing every year. Jianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Zhaohua County, Sichuan Province, used to have nearly half of its households lacking food in 1953 due to soil erosion and drought and flood disasters. After the cooperative vigorously carried out soil and water conservation in recent years, now not only are there no households lacking food, but also 60,000 jin of surplus grain were sold this year. At present, 72 out of 76 households in the entire cooperative have caught up with or exceeded the living standards of local wealthy middle peasants.

In recent years, thousands of typical examples of managing one mountain, one gully, and one river have emerged across the country, which has played a huge role in promoting soil and water conservation work. For example, 455 new-type Daquanshan have appeared in Yanbei Special Zone, with an average of 38 "Daquanshan" in each of the 12 counties in the entire region. Wushan County, Gansu Province, has now expanded from a Dengjiabao typical example to 109. Various places have also trained a large number of cadres familiar with soil and water conservation technology and local peasant technicians through visits, internships, and other training methods. According to incomplete statistics, more than 300,000 peasant technicians from agricultural cooperatives have been trained nationwide. In Jiyuan County, Henan Province, more than 250 party and government cadres at all levels have learned the techniques of building small reservoirs, planting trees, repairing valley embankments, and water cellars, solving the contradiction that the leadership work cannot keep up with the construction requirements of the masses. This year, Wanquan County, Hebei Province, adopted the method of "county and township party committee secretaries taking command and directing the battle on the spot" to lead the construction, and they personally led the team to work. Now, 12 of the 15 mountainous township party committee secretaries in the county have mastered engineering technology and construction organization. (Attached picture)

In the past, Beigu Township, Suining County, Sichuan Province, suffered from serious soil erosion. It was dry when it didn't rain, and disastrous when it rained, and the cultivated land was shrinking year by year. After agricultural cooperativization, more than 350 mu of soil have been improved in recent years, basically stopping soil erosion and drought and flood disasters.

    土不下坡泥不出沟细水长流
    许多过去水土流失严重地区出现新面貌
    新华社23日讯　新华社记者从第二次全国水土保持工作会议获悉：我国水土保持工作成绩巨大，截止目前的初步统计，已经在水土流失地区的十九万五千多平方公里的面积上进行了水土保持措施，约占我国全部水土流失面积一百五十万平方公里的13％以上。在许多过去水土流失严重的地方，已经出现土不下坡、泥不出沟和河里细水长流的新面貌。
    我国农业合作化的实现，使水土保持工作进入了新阶段，广大群众向自然作斗争中显出了巨大的威力。黄河中游自解放以来，约计完成初步控制面积七万八千多平方公里，其中在1956年到1957年9月，就完成了初步控制面积五万三千多平方公里，这一年零九个月的工作量就相当于过去六年工作量总和的两倍以上。漭河流域在解放后就开始着手治理，但在1955年冬季以前，由于受到个体经济的限制，治理工程进展很慢；实现合作化后，广大群众就掀起了“百库、千井、万水窖”的运动。仅造林和修小水库两项，在农业合作化的一年多时间里，就超过合作化以前历年工程总和的五倍以上。全国著名的大泉山农业社，合作化后的两年中已完成控制水土流失面积一万六千八百五十五亩，占到全社应治理面积的63％。这个社的张风林和高进才，他们两人虽然经过十八年的辛勤劳动，一共才治理了四百四十七亩。
    全国大规模的水土保持工作，已开始对提高山区生产、改变山区自然面貌和减轻水旱灾害起着显著作用。漭河流域上游山区经过封山育林和植树造林二十二万亩后，已拦蓄雨水一千多万公方，现在这里连续降雨十公厘，地皮不湿；降三十公厘，水不下坡；降五十到一百公厘，三日后清水外流，现在群众说：“雨后三日不见水，久旱多日水长流。”陕西省在几年来已初步控制水土流失面积一万九千多平方公里，估计每年平均可避免五千多万吨泥沙流入黄河。在广东山区，崩山口水土流失的现象非常严重。广东五华县用各项工程措施和生物措施对许多崩山谷口和崩山边缘进行了治理后，已经收到显著效果，这个县的水稻年产量每年都有提高。四川省昭化县的建峰农业社，过去由于水土流失和旱涝灾害，这个社在1953年时还有将近一半的缺粮户。这个社在几年中大力进行水土保持后，现在不仅没有缺粮户，今年还卖出余粮六万斤。目前全社七十六户中就有七十二户赶上或超过了当地富裕中农的生活水平。
    几年来，全国出现了成千上万个治理一山一沟一河的典型，对推动水土保持工作起了巨大作用。例如雁北专区已经出现了四百五十五个新型的大泉山，全区十二个县平均每县有三十八个“大泉山”。甘肃省武山县现在已由一个邓家堡典型推广到一百零九个。各地还通过参观、实习和其他训练的办法，出现了大批熟习水土保持技术的干部和当地的农民技术员。据不完全统计，全国已训练了农业社的农民技术员达三十多万人。河南省济源县有二百五十多个各级党政干部，都学会了修小型水库、植树造林、修谷坊和水窖的技术，解决了领导工作赶不上群众要求建设的矛盾。河北省万全县今年采取了县、乡党委“书记挂帅，临阵指挥”的办法来领导施工，他们亲自带队出工。现在全县十五个山区乡的党委书记中有十二人已懂得工程技术和组织施工。（附图片）
    四川省遂宁县北固乡过去水土流失严重，不雨即旱，遇雨成灾，耕地逐年缩小。农业合作化以后，几年来已改良了土壤三百五十多亩，基本上制止了水土流失和旱洪灾害。
