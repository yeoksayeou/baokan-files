Report compiled by our newspaper: According to a Xinhua News Agency report: Japanese political circles and public opinion strongly condemn the Kishi Nobusuke government's decision to accept "Sidewinder" air-to-air missiles supplied by the United States.

The Japanese government decided to accept U.S. missiles on the morning of the 20th. Defense Agency officials revealed that Japan will purchase these missiles from the United States and they are expected to arrive in Japan next spring.

The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement pointing out that the Japanese government's decision makes Japan more dependent on U.S. aggressive policies and intensifies the situation in Asia. The statement pointed out that the Japanese people will never take the dangerous road leading to war.

The Japan Socialist Party issued a statement on the 20th, strongly opposing turning Japan into a missile base. The statement pointed out that Japan's acceptance of these missiles marks the first step in the United States bringing nuclear weapons into Japan. This action by the Japanese government proves that Kishi Nobusuke's promise was a complete deception. The Socialist Party stated that it would thoroughly investigate this matter in the Diet.

An editorial in the "Asahi Shimbun" stated that it could not agree with Japan's decision to accept U.S. missiles. The editorial went on to point out that the mission of the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee, as originally stated by Kishi Nobusuke, has changed. The committee has become an institution adapted to the U.S. atomic war system. This is an act of Kishi Nobusuke deceiving the Japanese people.

An editorial in the "Mainichi Shimbun" pointed out that the Japanese people are concerned that the Japanese government's move to bring U.S. missiles into Japan this time is the first step in bringing in atomic and nuclear weapons. The editorial stated that it cannot agree to Japan's gradual rearmament under any circumstances. The editorial demanded that the Japanese government submit its expansion plans to the Diet for deliberation.

An editorial published in the "Akahata" on the 23rd pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government's decision to bring U.S. missiles into Japan is to make Japan play the role of Turkey in the Middle East. The editorial pointed out that this action taken by the Kishi Nobusuke government shows that it has embarked on a path that is extremely dangerous for the Japanese people. This action will turn Japan into an orphan in Asia. The editorial condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for taking this action as a challenge to the Japanese people.

The "Tokyo Shimbun" pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government has now decided to bring weapons like missiles into Japan, and who knows what dangerous things it will do in the future. The newspaper said that it is only natural that all Japanese people feel uneasy and doubtful.

    决不同意美国加紧武装日本
    日本舆论强烈反对接受美国导弹
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：日本政界和舆论强烈谴责岸信介政府决定接受美国供给的“响尾蛇”式空空导弹。
    日本政府是在20日上午决定接受美国导弹的。防卫厅官员透露，日本将向美国购买这种导弹，预料明年春天可以运到日本。
    日本共产党发表声明指出，日本政府的这个决定使日本更加依附美国的侵略政策，使亚洲的局势更加紧张。声明指出，日本人民决不走导向战争的危险道路。
    日本社会党20日发表声明，强烈反对把日本变成导弹基地。声明指出，日本接受这种导弹标志着美国把核武器运进日本的第一步。日本政府的这种行动证明岸信介的诺言完全是个欺骗。社会党表示要在国会中彻底追究这件事。
    “朝日新闻”的社论表示不能同意日本决定接受美国导弹的做法。社论接着指出，岸信介当初所说的日美安全委员会的任务已经改变。这个委员会已经变成了适应美国原子战争体制的机构。这是岸信介欺骗日本人民的行为。
    “每日新闻”的社论指出，日本人民担心日本政府这次把美国导弹运进日本是运进原子核武器的第一步。社论表示无论如何也不能同意日本逐步重整军备。社论要求日本政府把扩军计划提交国会审议。
    “赤旗报”23日发表的社论指出，岸信介政府决定把美国导弹运进日本，是为了使日本在亚洲扮演土耳其在中近东扮演的角色。社论指出，岸信介政府采取的这一行动表明，它已经走上了一条对日本人民说来是极端危险的道路。这种行动将使日本变成亚洲的孤儿。社论指责岸信介政府采取的这种行动是对日本人民进行的挑战。
    “东京新闻”指出，岸信介政府现在决定把像导弹这样的武器运进日本来，今后不知道还会做出怎样危险的事情。这家报纸说，全体日本人民感到不安和疑虑是理所当然的。
