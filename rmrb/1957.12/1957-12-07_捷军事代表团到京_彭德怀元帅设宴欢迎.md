The Czechoslovak military delegation consists of ten members, including Lieutenant General Vosahlo, Lieutenant General Kolovratník, Major General Prchlík, Major General Bedřich, and Colonel Lallo.

At 1:40 PM, the special plane carrying the military delegation arrived at the airport. As General Lomský and the entire delegation stepped off the plane, Marshal Peng Dehuai, Grand General Su Yu, Grand General Tan Zheng, Senior General Xiao Hua, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, who were at the airport to welcome the distinguished guests, stepped forward to shake hands with them individually.

General Lomský, accompanied by Marshal Peng Dehuai, reviewed the guard of honor. He greeted the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Chinese, saying, "Hello, comrades!" The soldiers responded loudly, "Hello, Minister!"

Following this, a welcoming ceremony was held at the airport.

Marshal Peng Dehuai, on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extended a warm welcome and high respect to the close Czechoslovak comrades-in-arms who had come from afar. In his welcoming address, he said that the Czechoslovak People's Army, under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, has now become a well-trained and well-equipped modern force, steadfastly defending socialist construction and world peace. He said that their visit to China would make a beneficial contribution to enhancing the understanding and friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Czechoslovakia.

In his reply, General Lomský extended greetings to all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He said that the working people and soldiers of Czechoslovakia are following with great concern the wise and creative leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in socialist construction and army building, based on China's actual conditions.

Xinhua News Agency, December 6th: Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai hosted a banquet on the evening of December 6th to welcome the entire military delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic, headed by General Lomský.

Attending the banquet as hosts were senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, including Marshal He Long, Marshal Chen Yi, and Marshal Nie Rongzhen. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan also attended the banquet as host. Czechoslovak Ambassador to China Bušniak and military attachés from various countries stationed in China were also invited to attend the banquet.

Marshal Peng Dehuai delivered a speech at the banquet, welcoming General Lomský and the entire delegation, the envoys of the fraternal Czechoslovak army. He said that the Czechoslovak People's Army, together with the glorious Soviet Army and the armies of other fraternal countries, is a powerful force defending the cause of socialism and safeguarding peace in Europe and the world, and is our loyal and reliable comrade-in-arms. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is proud and feels a great sense of responsibility in being able to guard the eastern border of the great socialist camp together with you. Marshal Peng Dehuai said that the Czechoslovak People's Army has made tremendous achievements in army building in a relatively short period of time. This achievement is not only of great significance for guaranteeing the independence and freedom of the Czechoslovak people, but also a major contribution to strengthening the defense capabilities of the socialist camp. We are pleased with your achievements and are willing to take the opportunity of the delegation's visit to our country to learn from your valuable experience in army building.

General Lomský then delivered a speech, saying that the Czechoslovak people regard the People's Republic of China as one of the main pillars of the entire socialist camp. This is not only because China is vast and populous, but mainly because China has exerted a great influence on the entire international workers' movement, on the strength and unity of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, and on consolidating world peace. General Lomský said that we are proud to have such allies and brothers as the Chinese people and army. The rich experience gained by your party and army is a major contribution to the treasure house of the international workers' movement, and an important source of learning for us in consolidating the fighting strength and political strength of our soldiers.

At the banquet, the guests and hosts warmly toasted the fraternal friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Czechoslovakia. Before the banquet, Marshal Peng Dehuai met with all members of the military delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic.
