    Outstanding Labor by Transferred Cadres from Beijing No. 2 State-Owned Cotton Mill

    Editor:
    In late October, the transferred cadres from the Beijing No. 2 State-Owned Cotton Mill, upon arriving at the Dahongmen Agricultural Cooperative, were warmly received and cared for by the cooperative members. The cooperative cadres, recognizing that they were new to rural life and lacked labor habits, assigned them light tasks such as threshing, tending fields, and picking cabbage leaves. Yang Paikui, the captain of the first production team, concerned that they might be hesitant to drink cold water, prepared boiled water for them when they worked in the fields. When a new member from the second production team took off his clothes to work and began to sweat, an elderly woman in her fifties, fearing he would catch a cold during breaks, took a cotton-padded coat and draped it over the new member, Li Enzhong. Li Enzhong said with emotion, "The veteran cooperative members care for us like our own mothers."

    This warm care in production and life made the transferred cadres feel the warmth of the new socialist countryside, and their labor enthusiasm was even higher. Many transferred cadres, when they first started working, were so tired that their backs ached and their legs were sore. The veteran cooperative members repeatedly urged them to rest, but they all refused. Sun Xiyuan, who came from a student background, swayed back and forth when he initially carried soil, and his shoulders were also swollen. However, he persevered and didn't do less work. Wang Cunfang, the former workshop recorder and female member of the Communist Youth League, worked more and better than the average male cooperative member. Male cooperative members carried three bundles of rice, while she carried five. While carrying soil, she and a male cooperative member carried a large basket full of soil, sweating profusely, but she refused to rest and didn't complain or utter a word of fatigue. The diligence of the transferred cadres was praised by the cooperative cadres and veteran cooperative members. Chen Zhaoshan, a veteran cooperative member, initially thought that the transferred cadres couldn't endure as much as an old woman. However, before long, he said to Zhang Fuxiang, the cooperative director, "They are new here and may lack physical strength, but they work no less than the veteran cooperative members. They are truly good cadres, capable in both literary and military pursuits." The seventh production team did not have any transferred cadres, so the captain and cooperative member, Ren Chuanxiang, approached the cooperative director and said, "The new cooperative members (transferred cadres) are working so well and are so capable. We must quickly allocate a few to our team."

    The hard work of these transferred cadres has reversed the old ideas of some people in the countryside who looked down on labor, and it has begun to establish a new ethos of labor being the most glorious in the countryside. Some cooperative members who rarely participated in production in the past are now participating in labor such as water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation. Some cooperative cadres who rarely participated in the cooperative's agricultural work in the past have also changed their leadership style after seeing the enthusiasm of the transferred cadres and have devoted themselves to water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, adopting a leadership method of driving production through production. Eleven graduates from primary and secondary schools and young cooperative members who were not content with agricultural production and wanted to go to the city to become workers or cadres have now settled down. Yang Dunying, a junior high school graduate, said, "They (referring to the transferred cadres) used to be cadres, their abilities are stronger than ours, and their education is higher than ours, but they are content with production. What reason do we have not to be content with production?"

    Many transferred cadres can also go deep among the masses, connect with the masses, and play a role in mobilizing and leading production, effectively promoting rural production and construction. In late November, in accordance with the spirit of the Municipal Party Committee's rural work conference, the cooperative revised its winter large-scale production plan, aiming to develop (expand) 500 mu of irrigated land in ten days. Some cadres and cooperative members lacked confidence in completing this task. The transferred cadres, on the one hand, carried out propaganda among the masses about the necessity of water conservancy construction for the great leap forward in production next year; on the other hand, they discussed methods of expanding irrigated land with the masses. The transferred cadres participating in the first production team persuaded and encouraged the entire team to propose challenge conditions to the entire cooperative; the transferred cadres participating in other production teams also mobilized their respective teams to respond to the challenge. In just six days, the entire cooperative overfulfilled the plan to expand irrigated land. The cooperative held a general meeting of all cooperative members to reward and commend the cooperative members who excelled in labor during the competition. Seven transferred cadres were rewarded, and ten were commended.

    The reason why the transferred cadres are working so well is inseparable from the factory's care for them. The factory director, Party committee secretary, and chairman of the trade union often visit the cadres transferred to the countryside, learn about their production, living conditions, and winter preparation through individual conversations and forums, and encourage them to continue to work hard and transform themselves in labor. The transferred cadres are very grateful for the factory's care, which further inspires their labor enthusiasm. Deng Lingyue, the former trade union cadre, said to factory director Song Ting, "Factory director, rest assured, I will definitely train myself better in labor." Tang Xianzhi, a transferred cadre, had wavered during the arduous labor process; but as he gradually learned production techniques and received care and encouragement from the factory, he has fallen in love with agricultural labor and is determined to see it through to the end.

### 北京国棉二厂下放干部劳动出色

    北京国棉二厂下放干部劳动出色
    编辑同志：
    10月下旬，北京国棉二厂的下放干部，刚到大红门农业社，就受到社员们的热情招待和照顾。社干部觉得他们刚到农村，没有劳动的习惯，便分配他们做打场、看畦、拣白菜叶等轻活。第一生产队队长杨拍奎，怕他们不敢喝凉水，下地干活时就给他们准备了开水。第二生产队的新社员脱衣服干活出了汗，有个五十多岁的老大娘，怕他们休息时感冒，就拿起棉袄给新社员李恩忠披上。李恩忠感动地说：“老社员这样关怀我们，真是像自己的老妈妈一样。”
    生产和生活上的这种热情的关怀，使下放干部感到了社会主义新农村的温暖，他们的劳动热情更加高涨。许多下放干部刚开始劳动的时候，累得腰痛腿酸，老社员再三劝他们休息，他们都拒绝了。学生出身的孙希源，最初抬土时东摇西晃，肩也压肿了，他还是坚持下来了，没有少干一点活。原车间记录员、女共青团员王存芳，比一般男社员劳动得又多又好，男社员扛三个稻子，她扛五个。在抬土时，她和一个男社员抬了满满的一大筐土，出了满头大汗，也不肯休息，更没叫过一声苦，没喊过一声累。下放干部的这种干劲，受到了社干部和老社员的称赞。老社员陈兆山，原来认为下放干部顶不住一个老太太。没有多久，他就对社主任张福香说：“他们新来，体力不够，可是，干活不低于老社员，真是能文能武的好干部，”第七生产队没有下放干部，队长和社员任传祥找到社主任说：“新社员（下放干部）劳动这样好，真是干手，一定要快些给我们队分配几个。”
    下放干部的这种刻苦劳动的行动，扭转了农村中一部分人轻视劳动的旧思想，开始在农村中树立了劳动最光荣的新风尚，有的社员过去经常不参加生产，现在参加了兴修水利、积肥等劳动。有的社干部过去轻易不参加社里的农活劳动，看到下放干部艰苦劳动的热情也改变了领导作风，投入了水利建设和积肥运动，采取了以生产带动生产的领导方法。原有十一名中小学毕业生和青年社员不安心农业生产，想进城当工人、当干部，现在也都安定下来了。初中毕业生杨敦英说：“人家（指下放干部）当过干部，能力比咱们强，文化比咱们高，都安心生产，咱还有啥理由不安心生产。”
    不少下放干部，还能深入群众，联系群众，在生产中起到了鼓动和带动作用，有力地推动了农村的生产建设。11月下旬，社里根据市委农村工作会议的精神，修订了冬季大生产计划，要在十天中开出（扩大）水浇地五百亩。部分干部和社员对完成这个任务没信心，下放干部就一面向群众进行明年生产大跃进必须兴修水利的宣传；一面和群众商量扩大水浇地的办法。参加第一生产队的下放干部，说服和鼓励全队向全社提出了挑战条件；参加其他生产队的下放干部，也分别动员本队应战。只用了六天工夫，全社就超额完成了扩大水浇地的计划。社召开了全体社员大会，对竞赛中劳动突出的社员进行了奖励和表扬，下放干部就有七人受到奖励，十人得到表扬。
    下放干部劳动得这样出色，是和厂里对他们的关怀分不开的。这个厂的厂长、党委书记、工会主席，经常访问下放到农村的干部，通过个别谈话和召开座谈会，了解他们的生产、生活情况和过冬的准备情况，并且勉励他们继续努力，好好地在劳动中改造自己。下放干部对厂里的关怀很为感激，更加鼓舞了他们的劳动热情。原工会干部邓凌岳向厂长宋汀说：“厂长放心，我一定在劳动中将自己锻炼得更好。”下放干部汤先知在艰苦的劳动过程中，也曾经动摇过；但当他逐渐学会了生产技术，又得到厂里的关怀和鼓励，他已经爱上了农业劳动，决心干到底。
