Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 27th. According to a broadcast by Vientiane Radio today: Lao Prime Minister Prince Phouma and former leader of the Lao Fighting Forces, Prince Souphanouvong, recently addressed the people of Luang Prabang, the ancient capital of Laos, unanimously emphasizing the spirit of reconciliation to strengthen national unity and self-reliance in order to strive for economic independence.

The two princes passed through Luang Prabang on December 20th on their way back to Vientiane after completing the task of handing over and taking over the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly, the assembly areas of the former Lao Fighting Forces. Citizens welcomed the two princes at the club in this ancient capital and listened to their speeches.

Phouma said that an important point in the Lao government's domestic policy is to unite all Lao people. The government hopes to achieve reconciliation among the Lao people and peace in their lives.

He said that in four months, supplementary elections to the National Assembly, in which the former Lao Fighting Forces will participate, will be held. In this election, Lao women will have the right to vote and to be elected for the first time. Phouma called on everyone to elect people who actively work for the country as members of parliament.

Phouma emphasized that Laos cannot achieve complete independence without economic independence. He said that Laos imports too many foreign goods, while its exports are minimal. If the Lao people do not build their country's economy through self-reliance or only pursue personal interests, then the government will not be able to overcome difficulties, and the country will not be strong. He called on the Lao people to strengthen unity and mutual assistance in production and construction and to work hard to build the national economy.

Souphanouvong then spoke. He hoped that all Lao people could look to the future and build the country in the spirit of national reconciliation, and that there would be no more contradictions between the provinces, and that all the people could unite into a strong whole.

Souphanouvong said that Laos is a small country but has a glorious history. It will never allow foreign countries to trample on its honor and sovereignty and will resolutely safeguard its honor and sovereignty. He said, "We have ten fingers, so we must do it ourselves and should not rely on foreign countries."

Souphanouvong finally expressed his hope that all Lao people would work hard to help the demobilized and returned soldiers of the former Lao Fighting Forces so that they could safely reach their destinations. He said that doing this well is a manifestation of the spirit of people's unity, mutual assistance, and national reconciliation.

    为了老挝的民族团结和经济独立
    富马和苏发努冯强调和解精神
    新华社河内27日电　据万象电台今天广播：老挝首相富马亲王和前寮国战斗部队领袖苏发努冯亲王最近向老挝古都琅勃拉邦市的民众发表讲话，一致强调要以和解的精神来加强民族团结和自力更生以争取经济独立。
    两位亲王是在完成了移交和接管前寮国战斗部队集结区桑怒和丰沙里两省的任务以后，在12月20日返回万象途中经过琅勃拉邦的。市民们在这个古都的俱乐部里欢迎两位亲王，并且听他们的讲话。
    富马说，老挝政府对内政策中很重要的一点是使全体老挝人团结一致。政府希望老挝人之间获得和解，生活得到安宁。
    他说，再过四个月就要举行有前寮国战斗部队参加的国民议会补充选举。在这次选举中，老挝妇女第一次有选举权和被选举权。富马号召大家要选那些积极为国家办事的人来当议员。
    富马强调指出，老挝如果没有经济上的独立就不能取得彻底的独立。他说，老挝输入了过多的外国货物，而出口的东西却微乎其微。老挝人民如果不自力更生建设自己国家的经济，或者只贪图个人利益，那末政府就无法克服困难，国家也不能强盛。他号召老挝人在生产和建设中加强团结互助，努力建设国家经济。
    苏发努冯接着讲话。他希望全体老挝人能面向将来，以民族和解的精神来建设国家，希望各省之间不再存在矛盾，全体人民能团结成坚强的整体。
    苏发努冯说，老挝是一个小国，但是具有光荣的历史，它决不让外国蹂躏自己的荣誉和主权，并且坚决维护自己的荣誉和主权。他说，我们有十个手指，就要自己动手来干，不应该依赖外国。
    苏发努冯最后表示希望全体老挝人努力帮助复员返乡的前寮国战斗部队士兵，使他们安全抵达目的地。他说，作好这件事情也就是人民团结互助和民族和解精神的一种体现。
