Exceeding Quotas Every Month Without Complacency
    Baotou Steel Pipe & Iron Company to Further Increase Production and Save 2.7 Million Yuan

    (Our dispatch) A production upsurge focusing on promoting advanced experiences, proposing rationalization suggestions, and strengthening labor discipline has brought a completely new look to the Baotou Steel Pipe and Railway Engineering Company. Since launching the rectification movement in September, the company has completely reversed its past situation of failing to meet its plans, and has been exceeding its targets every month. The tasks completed in the three months from September to November were equivalent to 244% of the total workload completed in the four months from May to August. The cost reduction task has also been completed. The cost reduction target for October was 4%, but the actual reduction achieved was 15.12%.

    In various grassroots construction teams, a surge of proposing rationalization suggestions and promoting advanced experiences has emerged. Wei Lianzhong and Shen Chunyu, technicians of the Waterway Engineering Team, after a long period of painstaking research, proposed to change the reinforced concrete wells to stone masonry wells in a project, which saved the state 66,000 yuan. Workers in the Pipe Processing Plant twice requested to increase quotas during the movement. The Dong Wenjin team of the Pipe Engineering Team often failed to complete its tasks in the past. During the airing of views, the team's unity was strengthened. From September to November, it not only completed the plan every month, exceeding the quota by more than 40%, but also had good work quality, and was rated as a winning team in the competition for three consecutive months.

    The company was not satisfied with its existing achievements. On November 25, it convened a general meeting of all employees to further mobilize employees to carefully revise the savings plan, overcome conservative ideas, and ensure that the rectification and production achieve greater results. After discussion, all employees confidently proposed: By the end of the year, we will increase the nation's wealth by another 2 million yuan and save 700,000 yuan.

　　月月超额不自满
    包钢管铁公司将再增产节约二百七十万元
    本报讯　以推广先进经验、提合理化建议和加强劳动纪律为主要内容的生产高潮，已经使包钢管道铁路工程公司面貌焕然一新。从9月开展整风运动以来，这个公司彻底改变了过去完不成计划的局面，月月超额完成任务。9至11月三个月所完成的任务，就等于5至8月四个月所完成工作总量的244％。降低成本任务也完成了，10月份降低成本任务是4％，实际完成了15.12％。
    在各个基层施工小组，都出现了提合理化建议、推广先进经验的热潮。水道工程队的技术员魏连仲和申春雨，经过长时间的苦心钻研，在一项工程中提出把钢筋混凝土井改为石砌井的建议，就给国家节约六万六千元。管道加工厂的工人在运动中两次要求提高定额。管道工程队董文金小组，过去常常完不成任务，在鸣放中，小组的团结加强了，9至11月不仅月月完成计划，突破定额40％以上，而且工作质量好，连续三个月被评为竞赛优胜小组。
    这个公司并没有满足现有的成绩，11月25日召开了全体职工大会，进一步动员职工认真修改节约计划，克服保守思想，保证整风和生产取得更大的成绩。经过讨论，全体职工信心百倍地提出：到年底再为国家增产二百万元的财富，并且节约七十万元。
