Comrades:

    I am honored to be entrusted by the "Argentine Movement for Trade Union Democracy and Independence" to represent all members of our movement at this Chinese Trade Union Congress. I am confident that through the reports and discussions of the congress, I will be able to gain many experiences that will be helpful to the struggle of the working class in our country.

    Comrades, on behalf of the working people of Argentina, I extend fraternal, militant greetings to the Chinese workers and to the delegations representing workers from various countries gathered here.

    Comrades, I can say that your situation is different from ours. You enjoy broad democracy in discussing and deciding your own problems.

    I believe you are working with great enthusiasm and joy because your labor is not to enrich imperialists and capitalists, but for your own benefit and the benefit of the country. Your government is one that works for the people and is supported by the people. The people and the government are working together to build a great motherland.

    Comrades, in our country, capitalists ruthlessly exploit the working people. They impose the consequences of the ever-increasing economic crisis they have caused on the shoulders of the working people.

    Thousands of workers have been imprisoned. After long struggles by the workers, many comrades were released and continue to stand at their posts in the struggle. But we still have many workers imprisoned as political prisoners.

    Comrades, despite the harsh environment in which the working class in our country finds itself, their fighting power and fighting spirit are constantly growing. Strikes are a good proof of this: on September 27 this year, 305,000 people participated in a 24-hour strike. On October 22 and 23, four million workers held a 48-hour strike. This struggle put forward the following five demands: universal wage increases; opposition to rising prices; release of innocent worker political prisoners; abolition of the decree freezing wages; and abolition of the despotic decree expelling foreign workers struggling in our country.

    Comrades, our General Confederation of Labor has been dissolved by the government. Our main task is to unite all workers in a unified trade union. But the capitalists are trying their best to divide us. I should point out that the workers' wish is to establish a unified trade union. Therefore, our task of unity is arduous.

    Finally, I would like to point out that your Trade Union Congress will help strengthen and consolidate the fraternal ties between the working people of China and Argentina and the working people of all countries, and will help consolidate world peace.

    阿根廷工会代表
　　阿尔巴致词同志们：
    我很荣幸地受“阿根廷争取工会民主独立运动”的委托，代表我们运动的全体成员，出席这次中国工会代表大会。我深信通过大会的各项报告和讨论，我将能获得许多有助于我国工人阶级斗争的经验。
    同志们，我谨代表阿根廷劳动人民向中国工人同志们，向代表各国工人聚集在这里的各代表团致以兄弟般的、战斗的敬礼。
    同志们，我可以说，你们的情况与我们的不同。你们享有讨论和决定自己问题的广泛的民主。
    我相信你们是以极大的热情和愉快的心情劳动着，因为你们的劳动不是为了喂肥帝国主义者和资本家们，而是为了你们自己和国家的利益。你们的政府是一个为人民工作而又得到人民拥护的政府。人民与政府共同一致地在建设着伟大的祖国。
    同志们，在我们国家里，资本家对劳动人民进行着无情的压榨。他们把自己引起的日益增加的经济危机的后果强加在劳动人民的肩上。
    千万个工人曾经被关进监狱。经过工人们长期的斗争，很多同志获得了释放，继续站在斗争的岗位上。但是我们仍然有很多工人被当作政治犯关在监牢里。
    同志们，尽管我国工人阶级处在这种恶劣的环境中，他们的战斗力和斗争精神却不断地增长着。罢工就是一个很好的证明：今年9月27日三十万五千人参加了二十四小时的罢工。10月22日和23日有四百万工人举行了四十八小时罢工，这次斗争提出了下列五项要求：普遍提高工资；反对物价上涨；释放无辜的工人政治犯；废除冻结工资的法令；废除驱逐在我国进行斗争的外国劳动者的专制法令。
    同志们，我们的总工会曾经被政府解散过。我们的主要任务就是把所有的工人团结在一个统一的工会内。但是资本家极力想分裂我们。我应该指出，工人们的愿望是建立统一的工会。因此，我们的团结任务是艰巨的。
    最后，我愿意指出你们这次工会代表大会将有助于加强和巩固中国和阿根廷两国劳动人民和世界各国劳动者的兄弟般的联系，将有助于巩固世界和平。
