At Tongji University, in the course of rectification work, the university accepted the opinions of the masses and improved its teaching work. In order to implement the spirit of "managing teaching and learning, and being fully responsible," after thorough discussions, it was decided to establish one mentor in each small class of each grade, to be held by professors, lecturers, and some teaching assistants with teaching experience.

The selection of mentors will take two forms: one is that two teachers of basic courses and professional courses will be jointly responsible for a small class, with basic course teachers being primarily responsible for the first and second grades, and professional course teachers being primarily responsible for the third, fourth, fifth (sixth) grades; the other is that a professional course teacher will be responsible from the first grade until graduation.

    同济大学各班设导师
    同济大学在整改工作中，接受群众意见，改进教学工作。为了贯彻“管教管学、全面负责”精神，经过充分的讨论，决定在各年级各小班中设立导师一人，由有教学经验的教授讲师及一部分助教来担任。
    导师人选将采取二种方式：一种是基础课与专业课二位教师共同负责一个小班，一、二年级由基础课教师负主要责任，三、四、五（六）年级由专业课教师负主要责任；另一种是由专业课教师从一年级直到毕业，始终由一位教师担任。　（平）
