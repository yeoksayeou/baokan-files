Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: In the high tide of centralized rectification in the central state organs, some units that were initially slow in rectification are catching up with a spirit of revolutionary competition, gradually balancing the development of the movement. According to statistics, since mid-December, approximately one hundred and fifty departments and bureaus in the central state organs that were lagging in rectification have launched a high tide of rectification, with some units catching up with the advanced units.

The key to this situation is that many organs have strengthened specific leadership over units with slow rectification and have mobilized the masses to supervise the rectification. This has allowed for timely identification of the reasons for the delay and has changed the situation of ineffective rectification. For example, after inspection by the Ministry of Foreign Trade, it was found that the Food Export Corporation and the Technology Import Corporation were slow to act due to a lack of understanding of the importance of general rectification by leading cadres, and the rectification work lagged far behind other units. In the Food Export Corporation, due to the absence of the person in charge of managing materials, the opinions voiced by the masses were locked in a drawer. Until December 12th, the leading cadres of the company were completely unaware of what opinions the masses had put forward during the airing and how to rectify them. The ministry's leadership immediately strictly criticized this unserious and irresponsible attitude and urged the leaders of this unit to quickly grasp the rectification. The leaders of these two units quickly participated in sorting all the opinions, which were then submitted to the relevant departments and sections for discussion and research, and promptly announced to the masses. Now, more than half of the problems raised by the masses have been dealt with. The Ministry of Coal Industry has recently stepped up its supervision and inspection of three units that were slow to rectify, which quickly launched the rectification movement. The Scientific Research Institute affiliated to the ministry received more than 8,000 opinions from the masses during the airing, but by December 10th, only 12.4% had been rectified, and the rectification was very rough. The leadership lacked the determination to rectify some problems. For example, the deputy section chief of the General Affairs Section of the institute used his position to live in better housing. When the masses criticized him, the leadership explained that since he had already moved in, there was no need to move out. The masses were very dissatisfied. After inspection, this phenomenon was promptly corrected. Now, the three slow units of the ministry have caught up. One unit has rectified quickly and well, and the masses call them "rockets."

In the process of eliminating units lagging in rectification, the masses' posting of big-character posters for criticism and supervision has played a significant role. Cadres of the Architectural Engineering Publishing House posted big-character posters criticizing the leadership for ineffective rectification. The leaders of the publishing house immediately accepted the criticism and studied rectification plans overnight, which quickly developed the rectification work. By the 14th of this month, 86% of the opinions raised by the masses had been rectified, catching up with the advanced units.

The leaders of the organs also strongly supported the correct criticism of the masses, promptly talked to the responsible persons of these units, and urged rectification. Some ministries also sent people to these units to help with the work. Under the urging of the Foreign Trade Ministry's Rectification Leadership Group, the managers of the China National Technical Import Corporation immediately reported to all cadres, conducted self-criticism on the ineffective rectification in the previous stage, and expressed their determination to rectify more than 80% of the masses' opinions within a limited short period. The Labor and Wage Department and the Installation Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering adopted a rectification method that combined the leadership taking the initiative to be responsible at all levels and mobilizing the masses, and a high tide of rectification was formed within a few days. By the middle of this month, the rectification ratio had reached more than 80%. In order to strengthen the leadership of the Planning Department, the Ministry of Coal Industry transferred the director who had been temporarily transferred to another department to help with the work back to lead the rectification with all his strength. At the same time, several leading cadres in the department who had more shortcomings in their ideology and style of work and had more opinions from the masses also made self-criticisms to the masses. In this way, the masses were mobilized, and the problems rectified in three days increased from the original 35% to 95%, and the quality was better. After correcting the ineffective rectification, the Design Institute of the Urban Service Department had completely dealt with the problems that should have been dealt with in the general rectification stage. The masses were very satisfied, and the institute showed an unprecedented new atmosphere. Many engineering and technical personnel actively offered opinions to the leadership and launched mutual criticism. Some technical personnel took the initiative to talk to party members to exchange ideas and information. The widespread phenomenon of lax labor discipline in the past has also been overcome. In order to complete the design task of the 10,000-ton cold storage, some designers voluntarily worked overtime, and work efficiency has also improved significantly. Recently, after research, the repeated drawings were merged on the premise of ensuring quality, which can save ten drawings and complete the task ten days earlier.

### 中央国家机关加强具体领导发动群众监督  部分整改不力的单位迎头赶上来了

    中央国家机关加强具体领导发动群众监督
    部分整改不力的单位迎头赶上来了
    新华社22日讯  中央国家机关在集中整改的高潮中，一部分原来整改比较迟缓的单位，用革命竞赛的精神迎头赶上，使运动的发展逐渐平衡。据统计，进入12月中旬以来，中央国家机关内已经有大约一百五十个整改落后的司局单位掀起了整改高潮，部分单位已经和先进单位并驾齐驱。
    出现这种情况的关键是，许多机关加强了对整改迟缓单位的具体领导，并且发动了群众对整改的监督。这样就及时检查出迟缓的原因，改变了整改不力的现象。如对外贸易部经过检查，发现食品出口公司和技术进口公司由于领导干部对一般整改的重要意义认识不足，行动迟缓，整改工作远远落后于其他单位。食品出口公司由于管理材料的人出差，群众鸣放的意见竟被锁在抽屉里，到12月12日，公司领导干部对于群众在鸣放中到底提出了一些什么意见，应该如何整改完全心中无数。部的领导方面立即严格批评了这种不严肃和不负责任的态度，督促这个单位的领导人迅速抓紧整改。这两个单位迅速由领导亲自参加将所有的意见进行排队，分别交有关处、科讨论研究，及时向群众公布，现在这两个单位已处理的问题都已达群众提出的一半以上。煤炭工业部最近抓紧督促检查了三个整改迟缓的单位，使整改运动很快地发动起来。这个部所属的科学研究院，群众在鸣放中提出了八千多条意见，到12月10日只改了12.4％，而且改得很粗糙，有的问题领导上缺乏整改的决心。如这个院的总务科副科长利用职权住了较好的房屋，群众提出批评，领导上却解释说既然已经搬进去了，就不必再搬出来。群众很不满意。经检查后，及时纠正了这种现象。现在这个部的三个迟缓的单位已经赶上，有一个单位改得又快又好，群众称他们是“火箭”。
    在消灭整改迟缓单位的过程中，群众贴大字报批评监督起了很大作用。建筑工程出版社的干部贴出大字报批评领导上整改不力的现象，社的领导人马上接受批评，并且连夜研究整改方案，使整改工作迅速发展。到本月14日，群众提出的意见已经改了86％，赶上了先进单位。
    各机关领导上也十分支持群众的正确批评，及时找这些单位的负责人谈话，督促整改，有的部并且派人到这些单位去帮助工作。中国技术进口公司在外贸部整风领导小组的督促下，经理们立即向全体干部做报告，对前一阶段整改不力的现象进行了自我批评，并且表示决心要在限定的短时期内把群众意见整改80％以上。建筑工程部劳动工资司和安装局采取了领导亲自动手层层负责和发动群众相结合的整改方法后，几天内就形成了整改高潮。到本月中旬，整改比例都达到了80％以上。煤炭工业部为了加强对计划司的领导力量，把暂时调到别的部门帮助工作的司长调回去全力领导整改，同时司内几个思想作风上缺点较大、群众意见较多的领导干部也都向群众作了检讨，这样群众发动起来，在三天内整改的问题由原来的35％增加到95％，而且质量较好。城市服务部设计所纠正了整改不力的现象后，应该在一般整改阶段处理的问题已经全部处理完毕，群众十分满意，全所出现了从来未有的新气象。许多工程技术人员积极对领导提意见和展开相互批评，有些技术人员主动和党员谈话，交换思想情况。过去普遍存在的劳动纪律松弛的现象也克服了。为了完成十万吨冷藏仓库的设计任务，有些设计人员自动加班，工作效率也有显著提高，最近经过研究在保证质量的前提下把重复的图纸合并，可以节省十张图纸，也就可以提前十天完成任务。
