Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 27th: Soviet representative Arjumanyan stated at the plenary session of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference on the afternoon of the 27th that the Soviet Union is willing to provide economic, financial, and technical assistance to underdeveloped countries without any conditions attached—neither military nor political, economic nor social. The Soviet representative's remarks were met with a storm of applause from representatives of Asian and African countries.

Economist Arjumanyan, in his economic report, also stated that the Soviet Union can build factories or transportation equipment for underdeveloped countries, and can send experts or accept foreign students upon invitation, and can also provide assistance in the form of loans or technical aid within the limits of the Soviet Union's economic capacity. He cited the Soviet Union's aid to India, Burma, Afghanistan, Indonesia, and Egypt to illustrate his point.

He emphasized that the Soviet Union's trade policy is based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. He said, "The Soviet Union never forces the other party to accept goods they do not need, and never tries to harm or compete with local production."

The Soviet representative pointed out that Western industrialized countries provide assistance based on completely different principles, principles that violate the people's desire for peaceful coexistence, independence, and non-interference.

Speaking of American "aid," he said that the United States links its aid to underdeveloped countries to requiring these countries to participate in aggressive blocs, and most of the US aid is used for military purposes. The conditions for granting US aid also include investigating the economies of recipient countries, which interferes in the internal affairs of other countries. He also pointed out that the use of US aid is subject to US supervision, and the financial terms of US loans are too harsh for the weak economies of underdeveloped countries.

Addressing the Western countries, he said: "Let us compete with each other in aiding underdeveloped countries, and we hope that this competition will become a true foundation for expanding economic cooperation between countries."

The Soviet representative also said that once underdeveloped countries politically get rid of the shackles of imperialism, industrialization will play a decisive role in the development of these countries' national economies.

He said, "Industrialization must be based on a highly developed manufacturing industry, that is, one that can manufacture a wide variety of means of production, including machines, raw materials, and various forms of power."

Arjumanyan explained that once these countries begin to develop their own manufacturing industries, the problems of markets and capital are not insurmountable. He said that Asian and African countries can develop their rich resources through closer cooperation among themselves and by nationalizing foreign monopolies—like Egypt nationalizing the Suez Canal and Indonesia placing Dutch banks and other enterprises under government control.

He said that utilizing their own domestic manpower, financial resources, and resources is the basic and decisive condition for the economic revival of underdeveloped countries, but this does not preclude accepting aid from other countries. He added that these countries can rely on foreign aid to supplement their own domestic manpower, financial resources, and resources to accelerate industrial development. He said, however, that this foreign aid should be based on the Bandung spirit.

Arjumanyan also called on Asian and African countries to strengthen economic cooperation to overcome the backwardness caused by years of imperialist aggression.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 27th: The plenary session of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference continued at 3:30 PM today. The conference heard two economic reports from the Soviet Union and Japan, two cultural reports from China and Egypt, and a social report from Egypt.

The report made by Soviet economist Arjumanyan to the conference was warmly welcomed by the delegates.

It was announced at the meeting that three more delegations—Afghanistan, Italian Somaliland, and Thailand—had arrived. This brings the number of delegations attending the Asian-African Solidarity Conference to forty-two.

It was announced at the meeting that Kliment Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, had sent a telegram to the conference expressing his support. This news was also greeted with warm applause. Telegrams of congratulations to the conference from former Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo and former Iraqi Prime Minister Pachachi were also read at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 27th: Today was the second day of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, and five committees were established and held meetings. These five committees are: the Political Committee, the Economic Committee, the Cultural Committee, the Social Committee, and the Organizational Committee.

Mrs. Rameshvari Nehru, head of the Indian delegation, was elected chairman of the Political Committee. Under this committee, five subcommittees were established to discuss the various issues submitted to the Political Committee.

These five subcommittees are: the Imperialism and Colonialism Subcommittee, the Disarmament and Nuclear Weapons Subcommittee, the Palestine Subcommittee, the Algeria Subcommittee, and the Racial Discrimination Subcommittee.

The chairmen of these subcommittees will be the vice-chairmen of the Political Committee.

Nazim Mosily of Syria was elected chairman of the Economic Committee, and Dr. Mohamed Salim of Egypt was elected vice-chairman. The Egyptian representative, when reporting to the Economic Committee this morning, put forward a sixteen-point proposal to strengthen economic cooperation between Asian and African countries. It suggested the establishment of an Asian-African Common Market to render the European Common Market ineffective.

Taha Hussein, a famous Egyptian thinker, was elected chairman of the Cultural Committee, and Chu Tunan of China and Duncan of Ghana were elected vice-chairmen. A subcommittee consisting of representatives from Egypt, China, Burma, Syria, Japan, and Ghana was formed to unify arrangements and discuss the various reports submitted to the Cultural Committee.

The chairman of the Social Committee will be rotated among the chief representatives participating in the committee. This committee will discuss three reports: care for mothers and children, youth, and medical care.

Youssef el-Sebai, Secretary-General of the Conference, was elected chairman of the Organizational Committee. The agenda to be discussed in this committee includes the status and membership of the permanent secretariat of the conference and the establishment of Asian-African solidarity committees in various countries. All committees will meet again on the 28th.

    苏联代表在亚非团结大会上表示
    愿对不发达国家提供无条件援助
    希望同西方国家展开竞赛促进国际合作
    新华社开罗27日电　苏联代表阿朱马尼安在亚非团结大会27日下午全体会议上说，苏联愿意不附带任何条件——不论军事的或政治的，经济的或社会的——对不发达国家提供经济、财政和技术援助。苏联代表的这番话博得了亚非各国代表们暴风雨般的欢迎掌声。
    经济学家阿朱马尼安在他所作的经济报告中还说，苏联可以为不发达国家建立工厂或运输设备，并且可以应邀派遣专家或接受留学生，也可以在苏联经济能力所及的范围内以贷款或技术援助的形式提供援助。他列举了苏联对印度、缅甸、阿富汗、印度尼西亚和埃及的援助方式来说明他的论点。
    他强调指出，苏联的贸易政策是以平等互利的原则为基础的。他说，“苏联从来不强使对方接受它们所不需要的商品，而且从来不设法损害当地的生产或同它竞争。”
    苏联代表指出，西方工业发达的国家却以完全不同的原则来提供援助，这种原则是违反人民的和平共处、独立和互不干涉的愿望的。
    他在谈到美国的“援助”时说，美国把它对不发达国家的援助同要这些国家参加侵略集团联系起来，而且大部分美援都是用于军事目的。给予美援的交换条件还包括调查受援国的经济，这就干涉了其他国家的内政。他还指出，使用美援还必须受到美国的监督，并且，美国贷款的财政条件对不发达国家的薄弱的经济来说也是过于苛刻的。
    他针对着西方国家说：“让我们在援助不发达国家方面彼此竞赛吧，我们希望这种竞赛成为扩大各国间经济合作的真正基础。”
    苏联代表还说，一旦不发达的国家在政治上摆脱了帝国主义的枷锁，工业化将对这些国家的民族经济的发展起决定作用。
    他说，“工业化必须以高度发展的制造工业为基础，就是要能够制造各种各样的生产资料，包括机器、原料以及各种动力。”
    阿朱马尼安解释说，这些国家一旦开始发展自己的制造工业之后，市场和资金这两个问题就不是无法解决的。他说，亚非国家可以通过在它们之间进行更密切的合作以及把外国垄断企业收归国有的办法——像埃及把苏伊士运河收归国有以及印度尼西亚把荷兰银行和其他企业置于政府管制之下那样——来开发自己富饶的资源。
    他说，利用自己国内的人力、财力和资源是不发达国家经济复兴的基本的、决定性的条件，但是这并不排斥接受别国的援助。他又说，这些国家可以依靠外援来补充自己国内的人力、财力和资源，以加速工业的发展。他说，但是这种外援应该以万隆精神为基础。
    阿朱马尼安还要求亚非国家加强经济合作，以克服由于多年的帝国主义侵略而造成的落后状态。
    据新华社开罗27日电　亚非团结大会全体会议今天下午十五时三十分继续举行。会议听取了苏联和日本所作的两个经济报告、中国和埃及所作的两个文化报告和埃及所作的社会报告。
    苏联经济学家阿朱马尼安向大会所作的报告受到与会代表的热烈欢迎。
    会上宣布又有三个代表团——阿富汗、意属索马里兰和泰国——到达。这使出席亚非团结大会的代表团的数目增加到四十二个。
    会上宣布苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫致电大会表示支持，这个消息也受到热烈掌声欢迎。会上还宣读了前印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约和前伊拉克首相帕查奇致大会的贺电。
    据新华社开罗27日电　今天是亚非团结大会的第二天，有五个委员会宣告成立，并且举行了会议。这五个委员会是：政治委员会、经济委员会、文化委员会、社会委员会和组织委员会。
    印度代表团团长拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人当选为政治委员会主席。在这个委员会下面，成立了五个小组委员会以讨论提交政治委员会的各种问题。
    这五个小组委员会是：帝国主义和殖民主义小组委员会、裁军和原子核武器小组委员会、巴勒斯坦小组委员会、阿尔及利亚小组委员会和种族歧视小组委员会。
    这些小组委员会的主席将是政治委员会的副主席。
    叙利亚的纳齐姆·摩西利当选为经济委员会主席，埃及的穆罕默德·萨利姆博士当选副主席。埃及代表今天上午向经济委员会作报告时提出了一项包括十六点的加强亚非国家经济合作的建议。它建议成立亚非共同市场，使欧洲共同市场失去效用。
    埃及著名思想家塔哈·侯赛尼当选为文化委员会主席，中国的楚图南和加纳的邓肯当选为副主席。由埃及、中国、缅甸、叙利亚、日本和加纳的代表组成了一个小组委员会，以便统一安排和讨论提交文化委员会的各种报告。
    社会委员会的主席将由参加委员会的各首席代表轮流担任。这个委员会将讨论三个报告：对母亲和孩子的关怀、青年、医疗。
    大会秘书长优素福·西巴伊当选为组织委员会主席。将在这个委员会内讨论的议程包括大会常设秘书处的地位和成员以及在各个国家内建立亚非团结委员会的问题。所有的委员会都将在28日再度举行会议。
