Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 20th (Xinhua reporter Ye Shitao): This autumn, the Shanghai peak season market is experiencing a stable and moderate supply of goods. In stores, various seasonal commodities are well-stocked and available in a complete range of colors and varieties, allowing people to buy what they need at any time. Savings deposits in the People's Bank are gradually increasing. All of this stands in sharp contrast to the tight commodity supply and widespread stockouts that occurred during last year's peak season.

This year, the broad masses of Shanghai citizens have responded to the Party and government's call for hard work and frugality in building the nation, consciously restraining their increasing purchasing power. According to major stores such as the State-owned First and Second Department Stores and Wing On Company, high-end goods were generally easy to sell last year, but this year customers want economical and practical mid-range and low-end goods. At this time last year, cotton cloth stores and clothing stores were bustling, and the woolen garments in many fashion stores were sold out. Custom-made clothes generally took three weeks to a month to complete. The situation is different this year. Residents are trying their best to use old clothes and buy less new clothes, so half of the clothing ready-to-wear industry has switched to repairing and renovating old clothes. In October and November, these stores altered nearly 70,000 old garments. Since the beginning of winter, many housewives have been making their own cotton-padded clothes and re-dyeing old clothes, so the market for old cotton wadding and scattered direct dyes has become very brisk.

While people are buying less, many residents are saving the money they save. Since October, bank deposits have been rising steadily, increasing by a total of 10.74 million yuan in the seventy-plus days up to December 15. The current total savings deposit balance in the city has reached a new record of 527 million yuan, an increase of more than 60 million yuan compared with the same period last year.

The group purchasing power that exerted enormous pressure on the Shanghai market last year has been greatly restrained this year in various units implementing the policy of diligence and thrift in running enterprises, especially after the launch of the rectification movement. Near the end of last year, many units used budgeted funds to snap up non-essential sofas, carpets, radios, cameras, cars, and even electric fans that were not needed in cold weather, resulting in a serious waste of state funds and a tight supply of these high-end consumer goods in the market. This year, the Shanghai Branch of the People's Construction Bank of China conducted inspections in conjunction with daily financial supervision and did not find the above-mentioned phenomenon of rushing to spend money. Recently, eight factories and enterprises have turned over 830,000 yuan of surplus funds to the state treasury. All government agencies are now paying attention to careful calculation when purchasing furniture, equipment, and office supplies. According to People's Bank materials, the city's state administrative management fees cost more than 12 million yuan in September, but only more than 11 million yuan in October and November.

As a result of the development of the increase production and practice economy movement in various regions and the strengthening of market management by relevant departments in Shanghai, the foreign "big spenders" who appeared on the peak season market last year have basically disappeared. Last year, many wealthy procurement personnel unscrupulously collected daily necessities in the retail market, especially wool yarn and wool fabrics, which were in short supply at the time, not letting go of even a foot of woolen fabric or a pair of woolen pants. Some purchasing agents even secretly purchased goods in small quantities through brokers and vendors, or even blindly sought to get the goods, regardless of price, quality, or condition, resulting in a sharp rise in the price of old goods in the market, the re-emergence of brokers, and the blind development of underground factories. Since the third quarter of this year, procurement activities from other places have gradually decreased. Looking only at the system of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, the number of people sent to Shanghai for procurement from various regions was 7,196 in July, but decreased to 6,211 in November. The amount of goods entrusted to the Shanghai Supply and Marketing Cooperative Trust Department for procurement decreased by an average of 32% per month in October and November compared to the average monthly amount in the third quarter. With the decrease in procurement personnel from other places, the number of overnight stays by travelers in the city's hotels and business establishments decreased by 30% in November compared with the same period last year. The amount of procurement funds remitted by enterprises in various regions through the People's Bank also decreased by more than 60 million yuan in November compared with the same period last year.

As this year's industrial and agricultural production continues to grow and the distribution of income in agricultural cooperatives is postponed, it is estimated that the sales volume of commodities on the market will increase in the next month or two, which presents a new task for commercial workers: how to better meet the needs of consumers under the premise of adapting to the trend of frugality and simplicity. At present, Shanghai's commercial departments have begun to pay attention to this. While actively organizing sources of goods, they have changed the production quantity of certain commodities. For example, the production of thin bleached cloth and fine cloth has been appropriately reduced, and the supply of durable, washable, and inexpensive khaki drill, twill, and coarse cloth has been increased. Bed sheets with a width of six feet are too long to be used on ordinary beds, so the length has now been shortened by eight centimeters, which saves material and is practical, and the retail price of each sheet has been reduced by 26 cents accordingly. Various kinds of repair and renovation businesses are developing rapidly. In addition to renovating old clothes and old wool yarn, replacing collars for shirts, and replacing cuffs for undershirts, some stores have also launched businesses to repair basketballs, volleyballs, blackboards, copper drums, and motorized toys.

### 去年这时候商品供应十分紧张  今年这时候商品齐全市场平稳

    去年这时候商品供应十分紧张  今年这时候商品齐全市场平稳
    新华社上海20日电  新华社记者叶世涛报道：今年秋后的上海旺季市场上，物资供应出现了平稳和缓的现象。商店里，各种时令商品备货充沛，花色齐全，人们随时可以买到自己需要的东西。人民银行的储蓄存款正在逐步增长。这一切，同去年市场旺季一度出现的商品供应紧张、处处闹脱销的情况形成了鲜明的对照。
    今年以来，上海广大市民响应党和政府提出艰苦朴素、勤俭建国的号召，自觉地约束了自己日益提高的购买力。据国营第一、第二百货商店、永安公司等大型商店反映，去年高档货普遍好销，今年顾客都要经济实用的中低档商品。去年这时候，棉布店、服装店门庭若市，不少时装店的呢绒服装被购买一空；定做衣服，一般都要三个星期到一个月的时间。今年情况不同。居民们都尽量利用旧衣，少添新衣，因此服装成衣业中有半数商店都转而开展拆补翻修旧衣的业务。10、11两个月内，这些店就翻改了近七万件旧衣裳。入冬以来，不少家庭主妇自翻棉衣和复染旧衣，因而市场上旧棉絮和零星的直接染料销路大大畅旺。
    在人们少买东西的同时，许多居民把节约下来的钱拿来储蓄。10月份以来，银行存款步步上升，到12月15日为止的七十多天里，一共增加了一千零七十四万元。目前全市储蓄存款总余额达到五亿二千七百多万元的新纪录，比去年同期增加六千多万元。
    去年曾经使上海市场感到巨大压力的集团购买力，今年在各单位贯彻勤俭办企业方针，特别是开展整风运动以后，受到了很大的约束。去年接近年终的时候，不少单位用预算上的金钱抢购不急需的沙发、地毯、收音机、照相机、小轿车，甚至冷天根本用不到的电风扇，造成国家资金的严重浪费和市场上这些高级消费品的供应紧张。今年中国人民建设银行上海分行结合日常财政监督进行了检查，没有发现上述突击花钱的现象。最近还有八个工厂企业单位把多余资金八十三万元上缴国库。各机关购买家具设备、办公用品，现在也注意精打细算。据人民银行材料，全市国家机关的行政管理费9月份花了一千二百多万元，10月和11月都只有一千一百多万元。
    各地开展增产节约运动和上海有关部门加强市场管理的结果，去年旺季市场上一度出现的外来“豪客”基本上销声歛迹了。去年，许多阔气的采购人员在零售市场上不择手段地收罗日用品，特别是绒线、呢绒等当时供不应求的商品，连一尺呢料，一条呢裤也不放过。有些采购员竟私自通过掮客、摊贩零星套购，甚至盲目地只求商品到手，不问价格贵贱，品质好坏，以致市场上旧货价格猛涨，掮客重新活跃，地下工厂盲目发展。今年第三季度以来，外地采购活动逐渐减少。仅就全国供销合作总社系统来看，各地派来上海采购的人次，7月份是七千一百九十六人次，11月份已减到六千二百一十一人次，委托上海供销合作局信托部门代理采购的商品金额，10月、11月份平均比第三季度每月平均数减少32％。随着外来采购人员的减少，全市旅馆、商栈的旅客投宿人次，11月份比去年同期下降30％。各地企业通过人民银行汇入的采购款项，11月份也比去年同期减少六千多万元。
    由于今年工农业生产继续增长，农业社分配收益时间推迟，估计今后一两个月内，市场上的商品销售量将会上升，这就给商业工作者提出了一个新任务：如何在适应节约朴素风尚的前提下更好地满足消费者的需要。目前，上海商业部门开始注意到了这一点，他们在积极组织货源的同时，改变了某些商品的生产数量。例如，质料细薄的漂布、细布决定适当压缩生产，增加供应耐穿耐洗而又价格便宜的纱卡其、斜纹布、粗布。幅阔六尺的被单，铺在一般床上嫌长，现在长度缩短了八公分，既省料又实用，每条零售价也相应地降低二角六分。各式各样的修旧翻新业务正在迅速发展。除了旧衣翻新、旧绒线翻新、衬衫换领、卫生衫换袖口以外，有些商店还开展了修理篮球、排球、黑板、铜鼓和机动玩具等业务。
