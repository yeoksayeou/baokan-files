    Sweeping Snow
    In the past, residents of Beijing had a long-standing habit of each sweeping the snow in front of their own door: Zhang's snow would usually be swept towards his neighbor Li's house, and Li would naturally sweep it towards Zhang's; sweeping back and forth, it would all accumulate along the base of the wall between Zhang and Li's houses.
    Once the sun came out, the snow melted, and the slush flowed halfway down the alley; when the north wind blew at night, it would freeze into an ice rink. As a result, everyone had a share in the mud and the falls.
    In recent years, after a snowfall, everyone naturally starts by sweeping in front of their own door; however, they discuss as they sweep: where to pile it up, whether to scatter it, what to sweep first, and what to sweep later. The result is: the front of every household is clean, and the entire alleyway is even brighter.
    On Sunday, November 24th, after the snow, the children went out to participate in voluntary labor. My husband and I are both over sixty years old, and we also came out to participate in the whole alley's snow-sweeping. After the labor, we not only felt warm and comfortable all over; but also, we both felt excited. Unconsciously, we started talking about the old saying of "each sweeping the snow in front of their own door."
    So even we old people have experienced the value of the overall concept.

### 扫雪

    扫雪
    过去，北京的住户，很久就有各扫门前雪的习惯：张家的门前雪，照例是往邻居李家扫，而李家很自然地也往张家扫；扫来扫去，就集中在张李二家中间的一段墙根下。
    太阳一出，雪融化了，雪水流了半条胡同；夜晚北风一起，又会冻成一片冰场。结果，淌泥、滑倒是“大家有份”。
    这几年的雪后，大家当然也是先从自家门前扫起；可是，边扫边商量：集中在哪里、还是分散在哪里，先扫哪些、后扫哪些。结果是：家家户户门前干净，整条胡同的街道更为亮堂。
    11月24日，雪后的一个星期日，孩子们出去参加义务劳动去了。我俩都是上了六十岁年纪的人了，也出来参加了全胡同的扫雪。劳动以后，不但周身暖和和地感到舒服；而且，心里也是都在兴奋。不知不觉地就扯到这些“各扫门前雪”的老话上来。
    于是就连我们这老年人，也体验到整体观念的可贵了。
