    Missing a Big-Character Poster
    Dong Tingshou
    Our Director Zhang is too attached to his office. In the past three years, except for meetings and giving reports, it's rare to see him go down and talk to the masses. No wonder comrades secretly call him "the leader locked in the cabinet."
    This time, we put up three big-character posters for him, one of which asked him to reply the next day. We all thought that in this vigorous movement, Director Zhang would definitely come out and take a look at the big-character posters. But the next day, there was no reply, the third day, the fourth day… Comrades became impatient, and everyone elected me to go to Director Zhang.
    That afternoon, I went to the director's office. Director Zhang was sitting behind his desk, smoking a cigarette and looking at official documents on the table. I said, "Comrades asked me to ask you, have you read the big-character posters we put up?"
    "Oh! Sit down, sit down," Director Zhang said very politely, "I've read all the big-character posters. The opinions are very good, and I'm studying how to deal with them!"
    "One of the big-character posters asked you to reply the next day," I said, "But there's been no reply to this day. Comrades are asking you, do you still need to consider it?"
    "There's such a big-character poster?" Director Zhang said with some surprise, "You must be mistaken, I haven't seen it."
    "No mistake," I said definitively, "I wrote that big-character poster, and many comrades signed it."
    "Must be mistaken," he said even more definitively than I did, and opened the drawer as he spoke: "Look, it's not here."
    Director Zhang took out a notebook. I opened it and saw that it included many big-character posters we had written in the previous stage, copied very clearly. It was obviously the handwriting of Secretary Xiao Wang. But I couldn't find the one I was talking about no matter how I flipped through it. What's going on? Looking again, each big-character poster was marked with the time and place. Two big-character posters had the following written after them: November 3rd, front of the east corridor. The other locations noted were also the front of the east corridor or the front of the west corridor. Oh! I understood, Xiao Wang only paid attention to the front of the east and west corridors when copying the big-character posters, and didn't pay attention to the sides. That big-character poster was posted on the side, so it was missed. Our Director Zhang only sits in the office and looks at the big-character posters from the notebook. No wonder he didn't know there was such a big-character poster. Fortunately, the original draft of this big-character poster was in my pocket. I took it out and handed it to Director Zhang, saying, "There is indeed such a big-character poster, Xiao Wang missed it. Look, this is the original draft."
    After Director Zhang finished reading the draft, he frowned and said, "What's Xiao Wang doing? Too negligent. Why did he miss this one? He really should be criticized."
    Yes, Xiao Wang should be criticized, but shouldn't Director Zhang be criticized even more? So, we wrote another big-character poster, titled: "Missing a Big-Character Poster."

    抄漏一张大字报
    董廷寿
    咱们的张主任也太留恋他的办公室了，三年来，除了开会和做报告外，很难看见他到下面和群众谈谈，难怪同志们背地里叫他“锁在柜子里的首长”。
    这回，咱们给他贴了三张大字报，一张是请他第二天就答复的。我们总认为在这个轰轰烈烈的运动中，张主任一定会走出来看看大字报了，可是第二天不见答复，第三天，第四天……。同志们等得不耐烦了，大家公推我去找张主任。
    那天下午，我到主任办公室去了，张主任坐在办公桌后面，一面抽烟，一面看桌上的公文。我说：“同志们叫我来问您，我们贴的大字报您看过没有？”
    “哦！坐，坐，”张主任很客气的说，“大字报嘛，都看过了，意见提得很好，我正在研究如何处理呢！”
    “有一张大字报是请您第二天答复的，”我说，“可是到今天还没有答复，同志们问您，是不是还需要考虑？”
    “有这样一张大字报吗？”张主任有些吃惊，“你大概搞错了，我没有看到过。”
    “没有错，”我肯定地说，“这张大字报是我执笔写的，很多同志签了名。”
    “一定错了，”他说得比我还肯定，边说边打开抽屉：“你看，这里没有。”
    张主任拿出一本练习簿。我翻开一看，里面包括了上个阶段我们所写的许多大字报，抄写得很清楚，一看就看出是秘书小王的笔迹。但翻来翻去也找不到我所说的那一张，这是怎么回事呢？再一看，每张大字报下面都注着时间、地点，有两张大字报后面写着：11月3日，东走廊正面。其他所注的地点也都是东走廊正面，或西走廊正面。哦！我明白了，小王抄大字报时只注意东西走廊正面，没有注意侧面，那张大字报贴在侧面，正好抄漏了。我们的张主任只坐在办公室里，从练习簿上看大字报，难怪他不知道还有这么一张了。还好，这张大字报的底稿就在我口袋里，我掏出来送到张主任面前说：“的确有这样一张大字报，小王抄漏了，您看，这是底稿。”
    张主任看完底稿后，皱了一下眉头，说：“小王怎么搞的？太疏忽了，为什么正好把这张抄漏呢？真该批评批评。”
    是的，小王该批评，可是张主任难道不更该批评吗？于是，我们又写了一张大字报，题目就叫做：“抄漏一张大字报。”
