Xinhua News Agency, December 7th: Indonesian authorities are taking measures to prevent the Dutch Royal Rotterdam Lloyd (KRL) ships from escaping Indonesian waters.

The Indonesian side has discovered that some KRL ships sailing in Indonesia are attempting to change course and head for Singapore. Military authorities in Jakarta have already detained some ships belonging to this Dutch company. Authorities in Surabaya have taken similar measures. Military authorities are preparing to dispatch supervisors to every KRL ship to ensure the normal operation of maritime transport.

Indonesian sailors and passengers on some Dutch ships have prevented the ships from escaping. On December 3rd, a ship sailing from Jakarta to Cirebon had its course changed mid-voyage by the captain, who attempted to sail to Singapore. The Indonesians on board discovered this plot, immediately seized the helm, and sailed the ship back to Jakarta.

Three managers of KRL in Jakarta now admit that the Dutch headquarters of the company had ordered the ships to leave Indonesia. After the Indonesian Ministry of Defense issued an order yesterday to establish a management committee to temporarily manage KRL, these Dutch managers expressed their willingness to work under the supervision of the management committee.

The Indonesian people are very concerned about the takeover of KRL, as 70% of inter-island maritime transport in Indonesia uses the company's ships. Jakarta newspapers have pointed out that KRL has become an important political weapon for Dutch capitalists, who can incite local dissatisfaction with the central government by delaying the transportation of daily necessities and raising prices. They can also use the company's ships to transport weapons to the "Islamic Army" and other saboteurs.

The takeover committee of Indonesian workers' organizations today took over three Dutch banks with significant economic power in Indonesia – Escomptobank N.V., Algemene Bank Nederland and Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij (N.V.H.M.).

Indonesian workers also took over Internationale Crediet- en Handels-Vereeniging "Rotterdam" (Internatio), one of the five largest Dutch trading companies in Indonesia, today.

When taking over the three Dutch banks, Indonesian workers read out the announcement of the seizure of these banks to the Dutch directors of each bank, and pasted strips of paper with the words "Indonesian Industry" on the doors of the banks. The workers took possession of the keys to the bank warehouses and closely monitored the safekeeping of important documents and assets of the banks. The business of these banks continues as usual. The workers are awaiting orders from the military authorities for further action, and the Dutch directors of these banks continue to work under the "accompaniment" of Indonesian workers.

According to Antara News Agency, deposits in Dutch banks have been decreasing as many depositors have withdrawn their deposits from Dutch banks and deposited them in Indonesian banks instead.

The banks and trading companies that have been taken over are all tools used by Dutch monopoly capital to control the Indonesian economy. The capital of the three banks is measured in tens of millions of guilders. These banks engage in lending, foreign exchange, plantations, industry and commerce, mining, and transportation, and have one or two dozen branches throughout Indonesia, extracting huge profits from Indonesia every year.

With the takeover of Internatio, Indonesian workers have now taken over three of the five major Dutch trading companies, which are the monopolizers of Indonesia's import and export trade.

    印度尼西亚制止荷兰船逃走
　  工人又接管荷兰人的三家银行和国际洋行
    新华社7日讯　荷兰皇家轮船公司打算使它的船只逃出印度尼西亚水域，印度尼西亚当局正在采取措施加以制止。
    印度尼西亚方面已经发现了有若干在印度尼西亚行驶中的荷兰皇家轮船公司船只企图转变航线，开往新加坡。雅加达军事当局已经拘留这家荷兰公司的一些船只。泗水当局也采取了相同的措施。军事当局正在准备派遣监督人员到每一艘这家荷兰公司的船只上，以保证海运的正常进行。
    一些荷兰船上的印度尼西亚水手和乘客曾经制止船只逃走。12月3日，有一艘从雅加达开往井里汶的船，在航行途中驾驶人想转变航线把船开往新加坡，船上的印度尼西亚人发现这一阴谋后立即占领了舵室，并且把船开回雅加达。
    现在雅加达的荷兰皇家轮船公司的三个经理承认，这家公司的荷兰总经理处已经命令船只离开印度尼西亚。在印度尼西亚国防部昨天发出命令设立一个管理委员会来暂时管理荷兰皇家轮船公司以后，这些荷兰经理表示愿意在管理委员会的监督下工作。
    印度尼西亚人民对于接管荷兰皇家轮船公司一事十分关切，印度尼西亚各岛屿之间的海运有70％使用这家公司的船只。雅加达报纸曾经指出，荷兰皇家轮船公司已经成为荷兰资本家的一项重要政治武器，他们可以用拖延日用品的运输和提高价格等办法来煽动地方对中央政府的不满，还可以利用这家公司的船只运武器给“伊斯兰教军”和其他破坏分子。
    印度尼西亚工人组织的接管委员会今天接管了在印度尼西亚有很大经济势力的三家荷兰银行——小公银行、安达银行和亦士公通银行。
    印度尼西亚工人们今天还接管了在印度尼西亚的荷兰五大洋行之一的国际洋行。
    印度尼西亚工人们在接管三家荷兰银行的时候，分别向这些银行的荷兰董事宣读征收这些银行的公告，并且在银行的大门贴上写着“印度尼西亚产业”字样的条子。工人们接收了银行仓库的钥匙，并且严密监视各银行的重要文件和产业的保管工作。这些银行的业务仍然照常进行。工人们正在等待军事当局的命令作进一步的处理，这些银行的荷兰董事们也在印度尼西亚工人的“陪伴”下继续办公。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，荷兰银行的存款已经越来越少，很多存款人都把存款从荷兰银行里提出来，改存在印度尼西亚银行里。
    被接管的银行和洋行都是荷兰垄断资本控制印度尼西亚经济的工具。三家银行的资本都是以千万荷盾计，这些银行经营借贷、外汇、种植园、工商业、矿业和交通运输业，在印度尼西亚各地设立有一二十个分行，每年都从印度尼西亚榨取巨额的利润。
    随着国际洋行的被接管，印度尼西亚工人们已经在五大荷兰洋行中接管了三家，这些洋行都是印度尼西亚进出口贸易的垄断者。
