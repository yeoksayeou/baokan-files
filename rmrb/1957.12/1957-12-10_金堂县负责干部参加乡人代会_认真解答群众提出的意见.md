　　Responsible Cadres of Jintang County Participate in Township People's Congress
　　Earnestly Answer Opinions Raised by the Masses
　　(Our Dispatch) The First Secretary of the Jintang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, along with the heads of the Party Committee, political and legal departments, and financial and economic departments of Jintang County, participated in the Zhao Du Township People's Congress meeting on November 18th. They conducted a review and provided answers to various criticisms and suggestions raised by the township during the blooming and contending period. For the two hundred-plus opinions that could be immediately improved, the relevant departments also reported the improvement situation to the People's Representatives.
    During the blooming and contending period, the masses of Zhao Du Township raised six hundred opinions regarding various aspects of work. To properly handle these issues concerning the immediate interests of the masses, such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation, the Zhao Du Township General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Township People's Committee systematically summarized and prioritized the opinions. Any issues that the township and commune grassroots organizations could not resolve were immediately classified and forwarded to higher-level authorities for handling. Under the unified leadership of the Jintang County Committee's Rectification Committee, various departments of Jintang County earnestly and seriously studied these criticisms and suggestions. More than ten units in the financial and economic departments also formulated rectification plans based on the opinions of the masses, enabling the rapid resolution of fifty-three issues in the economic life of the masses that urgently needed to be addressed. For example, after the masses criticized the purchasing and inspection system for suppressing grades and prices, and for inconsistent evaluations, purchasing cadres not only immediately improved their inspection techniques in conjunction with studying national price policies but also stipulated that in the event of disputes between the trading parties, a consultative approach should be adopted to jointly evaluate and grade with the masses.
    At the Township People's Congress meeting, the heads of county-level departments also explained the progress of their improvement efforts. At the same time, they provided factual analyses and explanations for misunderstandings arising from the masses' lack of comprehensive information. For a small number of erroneous opinions, they provided positive education and criticism, thereby helping the masses to further enhance their political understanding and strengthen their overall national perspective.
    The representatives were very excited after hearing the leaders' explanations and accounts of the rectification work. They reflected, saying: "To listen to criticism and immediately correct it, only the people's regime led by the Communist Party would do that! The people are the masters; this is truly socialist democracy!"

　  金堂县负责干部参加乡人代会
　　认真解答群众提出的意见
    本报讯　中共四川省金堂县委第一书记带领着金堂县党委、政法、财经等各部门的负责人，在11月18日参加了赵渡乡乡人民代表大会会议，对这个乡在鸣放中提出的各种批评和建议作了检讨和解答。对于其中能立即改进的二百多条意见，各有关部门也将改进的情况向人民代表作了交代。
    赵渡乡群众在鸣放中，对各方面工作曾经提了六百条意见。为正确处理这些有关群众衣、食、住、行的切身利益问题，中共赵渡乡总支委和乡人民委员会，对所提意见系统地进行了归纳和排队，凡乡社基层组织不能解决的，立刻分类转交上级机关处理。金堂县各部门在中共金堂县委整改委员会统一领导下，认真严肃地研究了这些批评和建议。财经部门十多个单位还根据群众意见制定整改方案，使五十三件群众经济生活中最迫切需要解决的一些问题，迅速得到解决。如群众批评收购验级有压级压价、评价有忽高忽低的现象后，采购干部除马上结合学习国家价格政策改进验收技术外，还规定交易双方发生争论时，采取协商办法，与群众共同评价评级。
    县级各部门负责人在乡人民代表大会会议上，还说明了改进工作的情况，同时对于群众不了解全面情况而产生的误解，进行了实事求是的分析说明；对少数错误的意见，则作了正面的教育与批评，从而帮助群众进一步提高了政治认识，增强了国家整体观念。
    代表们听了负责人关于整改工作的交代和说明，非常兴奋。反映说：听了批评，马上改正，只有共产党领导的人民政权才会有！人民当家，这才是社会主义的民主嘛！
