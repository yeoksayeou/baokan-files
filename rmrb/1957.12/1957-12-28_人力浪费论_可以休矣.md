The "Waste of Human Resources Theory" Can Rest

Zhi Ping

Since the Party Central Committee issued the call for intellectuals to go to the countryside and mountains, the argument that "it is a waste of human resources for intellectuals to go to the countryside" seems to be everywhere. This argument is one of the theoretical bases for some intellectuals to refuse to go to the countryside and mountains. Their argument is: intellectuals have studied at universities and possess rich scientific knowledge, and should engage in scientific research, teaching, or administrative work in government organs; but now intellectuals are being asked to put down these important jobs and engage in simple physical labor like workers and peasants, isn't this a waste of talent? Some people even say this is "using steel as if it were wood."

Regardless of whether these self-proclaimed steel materials are actually steel materials, their desire to do important work is originally beyond reproach. Unfortunately, these "steel materials" have not first figured out which jobs are important and which are not in the great cause of building socialism. According to the Party's instructions, vigorously developing industrial and agricultural production on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, and conducting ideological remolding of intellectuals in the rectification movement, are the important tasks at present. For intellectuals, participating in industrial and agricultural production and transforming themselves into intellectuals of the working class through physical labor is the most important task at present. Developing industrial and agricultural production is a major issue for solving the clothing, food, socialist construction and world peace of the people of the whole country; and the training and transformation of intellectuals in physical labor is a century-old plan and an important measure to establish a working class intellectual contingent. This point is probably not openly opposed by anyone, but not everyone's thinking is completely clear. "The Theory of Waste of Human Resources" is one of the unreasonable arguments. Their mistake lies in looking down upon the actual labor of engaging in industrial and agricultural production, and looking too highly on the professional knowledge they pursue. In fact, they are looking at physical labor with extremely backward and short-sighted eyes. Taking agricultural labor as an example, they fail to see that socialist rural areas need new cultured peasants, who need not only to be able to operate agricultural machinery, but also to have new scientific and technological knowledge and knowledge in other aspects. Only in this way can the current economically and culturally backward rural areas be rapidly transformed into advanced and modern rural areas. This is a very glorious and great task, and it requires thousands of intellectuals to go to the countryside to contribute to the realization of this glorious and great task. From this point of view, intellectuals going to the countryside and mountains is not a question of making the most of their talents, but a question of whether they can be qualified. Therefore, the argument of "waste of human resources" and "using a sledgehammer to crack a nut" is a wrong statement that does not distinguish between the important and the unimportant, and puts the cart before the horse.
    
The traditional concept of "those who labor with their minds govern others, those who labor with their strength are governed by others" in the old society is the blueprint of the "Theory of Waste of Human Resources." "Those who labor with their minds govern others, those who labor with their strength are governed by others" is the ideology of the ruling class in class society, and it is also a dominant ideology. This phenomenon of opposition between mental labor and physical labor only exists in class society. It was not like this in the primitive commune era. According to legend, before Shun was enthroned as emperor (actually the chieftain of a tribal alliance), he was originally an ordinary peasant who farmed under Lishan Mountain. Emperor Yao heard that he was capable of labor and had good moral character, so he married his two daughters, Ehuang and Nuying, to him, and later gave the throne to him. This shows that at that time there was no distinction between high and low status, and there was no concept that mental labor was superior to physical labor. After Shun gave the throne to Dayu, he probably still had to engage in some kind of physical labor. Because the people in power at that time had not yet invented the method of fleecing the people, and of course there would be no bank deposits, and there would be no food to eat without labor. Although the story of Yao and Shun comes from legends, we have every reason to believe that this is a correct reflection of the actual life of primitive society. This historical legend definitely shows that in the era of Yao and Shun in the legend, mental labor and physical labor were not separated; people never had the concept of despising physical labor. But in class society, exploitation arose, and the exploiting class relied solely on exploiting the labor results of others to live, completely separated from physical labor. In order to maintain their exploitative order, the exploiting class also established a regime to rule the working people. At this time, in addition to the rulers, emperors, generals, and ministers, there also appeared the so-called scholar-officials, that is, intellectuals who served the ruling class. They called the work of ruling the laborers "laboring with the mind," which is what we call mental labor. From then on, the exploiting class monopolized knowledge and culture, regarding it as their privilege, and despised those who engaged in physical labor, regarding those who engaged in physical labor as lowly people. Thus, "those who labor with their minds govern others, those who labor with their strength are governed by others" also became the golden rule of class society. In short, every ruling class has a team of "scholars" or intellectuals who serve it. These so-called intellectuals are each raised and favored by the rulers with their own set of skills or knowledge to rule or fool the working people. Among them, some natural science or technical knowledge has become a valuable heritage of human culture and has been inherited, but most of the knowledge belonging to social sciences is distorted and contemptuous fallacies of the working people. The so-called "scholars" of feudal society and the so-called intellectuals of capitalist society relied on this so-called knowledge to serve the rulers loyally on the one hand, and to despise and oppress the working people on the other. The so-called "scholars are the head of the four classes of people" means that they are slaves to the rulers, and they may stoop to conquer in order to climb up; but to the working people, they are masters or teachers. Therefore, they must put on airs and develop an air of arrogance and self-importance, "with dignified manners," so that people will be in awe when they see them. Thus, in their minds, mental labor serving the rulers has the remarkable, noble and respected nature; and the productive labor engaged in by the working people has become a humble and insignificant menial service. This sense of superiority of intellectuals has been created by class society for thousands of years, and it has been popular in various societies, becoming a traditional concept of intellectuals and even working people. It is still dominating the thoughts and actions of intellectuals today. The "Theory of Waste of Human Resources" is a reproduction of this kind of thought in the present. It can be said that this is one of the harmful legacies left to us by class society.

This kind of thinking is harmful because it refuses the ideological transformation of intellectuals, and insists on the separation of mental labor from physical labor, and the separation of theory from practice. Therefore, there is also a struggle between two lines in the issue of intellectual transformation: one is the capitalist line of separating mental labor from physical labor, and the other is the socialist line of combining mental labor with physical labor.

We adhere to the socialist line of combining mental labor with physical labor. We believe that physical labor is not only the source of human knowledge, but also the real creator of mankind. In the process of engaging in the production of material materials, mankind not only transforms nature, making natural things serve mankind, but also transforms mankind itself, making mankind gradually change from the slaves of nature to the dominators of nature, and from ignorant primitive people to knowledgeable and cultured modern people. Therefore, all knowledge that can be called scientific originates from production labor and class struggle, and then returns to serve production and class struggle. Now that we are carrying out the socialist revolution and eliminating the social system of man exploiting man, we are creating social conditions for the combination of mental labor and physical labor, and for the leap forward development of industrial and agricultural production and scientific and cultural undertakings. To realize the ideal of combining mental labor with physical labor, we must first make the bourgeois intellectuals who are divorced from labor practice undergo labor training and transform themselves into intellectuals of the working class. Then they will be able to serve socialist construction well. Therefore, the combination of mental labor and physical labor, and the combination of theory and practice, has become the firm and unshakable principle of socialist society to transform intellectuals.

Those who hold the "Theory of Waste of Human Resources" may not agree with this view. They may think that they can serve socialist construction without transformation. Or they may say that doing teaching work, scientific research work, or other administrative work is also serving socialist construction, and can even play a greater role, while engaging in physical labor will hinder their progress in their profession. This seems to make some sense, but it is not entirely true. We need to ask, how much of your knowledge is actually useful? The bourgeois politics, economics, law, etc. learned from bourgeois schools are not only largely useless for socialist construction, but even harmful. This has been proven by the practice of the anti-Rightist struggle, and there is no need to say more. As for the intellectuals who have received socialist education and studied Marxism-Leninism, it seems that it should be admitted that they can serve socialism without going to factories and rural areas to undergo labor training, but the fact is not at all like this. The reason is very simple, because if intellectuals want to serve socialism, they must be familiar with the actual situation of socialist construction. The theoretical knowledge of Marxism-Leninism we have learned is of course very important, but after all, it is the experience summarized by our predecessors in the production struggle and social struggle at that time. What we can learn from this knowledge is only the principle of solving problems, not the dogma that can be copied in any situation. Because the objective world is developing and changing all the time. The knowledge we have learned must be combined with the current production struggle and social struggle, and tested in actual struggle, to know whether it is useful. Therefore, even if we have learned the theory of Marxism-Leninism, we must go to the grass-roots units of factories and rural areas to participate in actual life in order to combine basic knowledge with reality. This is applicable to both social science knowledge and natural science knowledge. A communication in the People's Daily on November 28 said: "The actual life in the countryside also made the comrades of Renmin University discover the shortcomings in the past teaching work. The teachers of the Department of Economics, in the past when talking about socialist agriculture, had some unrealistic places in the organization and distribution of labor force. For example, some people confused work points and work days. After this period of labor, the comrades also had a concrete rather than abstract understanding of the issue of labor creating the world. Someone said that when they go back to teach this course again, they will no longer make people feel that it is dogmatism." This fact shows that knowledge that has not been tested in practice is false and unreliable. If knowledge is divorced from the practice of production labor and class struggle, it will become a rigid dogma. The comrades of Renmin University mentioned in the communication probably did not doubt their knowledge before going to the countryside, but after going to the countryside, they found that their own knowledge had unrealistic problems. As for the knowledge of other intellectuals who have not gone to the countryside, it is probably no exception. It can be seen that the so-called knowledge we have should be verified in the practice of labor in a down-to-earth manner, to discard the false and retain the true, to discard the crude and retain the refined, so that it can become reliable and useful knowledge. This is called a scientific attitude. The idea that participating in labor will hinder professional progress is unfounded. Actual life tells us that some self-proclaimed intellectuals who think they are steel materials may actually be a set of embroidered pillows, which will burn when they see fire, and there is nothing great about them.

Therefore, we believe that intellectuals must go to labor to test and transform themselves in order to become useful talents. The "Theory of Waste of Human Resources" can rest.

    “人力浪费论”可以休矣
    知萍
    党中央提出知识分子下乡上山的号召以后，“知识分子下乡是浪费人力”的论调，似乎到处都有。这种论调是一些知识分子拒绝下乡上山的理论根据之一。他们的论据是：知识分子在大学里念过书，具有丰富的科学知识，应该从事科学研究工作、教学工作或机关业务行政工作；现在却要知识分子放下这些重要工作，和工人农民一样从事简单的体力劳动，岂不是大才小用吗？有的人竟说这是“把钢材当木材用”。
    姑不论这些自封为钢材的人究竟是否钢材，他们要作重要工作的愿望原是未可厚非的。遗憾的是，这些“钢材”们首先没有弄清楚在建设社会主义的伟大事业中，哪些工作是重要的，哪些是不重要的。根据党的指示，在优先发展重工业的基础上大力发展工农业生产，在整风运动中对知识分子进行思想改造，是当前的重要任务。对知识分子来说，参加工农业生产，在体力劳动中把自己改造成为工人阶级的知识分子，乃是当前头等重要的任务。发展工农业生产，这是解决全国人民穿衣、吃饭、建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的大事；而知识分子在体力劳动中受到锻炼和改造，乃是建立工人阶级知识分子队伍的百年大计和重要措施。这一点大概不会有人公开反对，但也不是所有的人的思想完全搞通了。“人力浪费论”就是不通的论调之一。他们的错误，在于把从事工农业生产的实际劳动看得过低，而把自己所追求的业务知识看得过高了。其实，他们是用极端落后和近视的眼光来看待体力劳动的。以农业劳动为例，他们看不到社会主义的农村需要新的有文化的农民，需要不仅会开动农业机器而且要具有新的科学技术知识和其他各方面知识的农民。这样才能迅速地把目前在经济文化上落后的农村改变成为先进的、现代化的农村。这是个非常光荣而伟大的任务，需要千千万万的知识分子到农村去为实现这个光荣而伟大的任务作出贡献。从这个观点来看，知识分子下乡上山不是什么大才小用的问题，而是能不能称职的问题。所以“人力浪费”和“大才小用”的论调是轻重不分、本末倒置的错误说法。
    旧社会“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的传统观念，是“人力浪费论”的蓝本。“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”是阶级社会中统治阶级的思想，也是一种占统治地位的思想。这种脑力劳动和体力劳动对立的现象，只是在阶级社会才有的。在原始公社时代就不是这样的。据传说，舜在没有受禅做帝王（实际上是部落式部落联盟的酋长）之前，原是在历山下种地的一个普通农民，帝尧听说他能劳动，又有很好的道德品质，就把两个女儿娥皇女英嫁给了他，后来又把帝位让给他。足见那时并没有什么门户高低的分别，也没有什么脑力劳动高于体力劳动的观念。舜把帝位让给大禹以后，大概也还是要从事某种体力劳动的。因为那时执掌权力的人还没有发明刮地皮的方法，当然也不会有银行存款，不劳动是不会有饭吃的。尧舜之事，虽然出自传说，但我们却完全有理由相信这是原始社会实际生活的正确反映。这个历史传说确定地说明了在传说中的尧和舜的时代，脑力劳动和体力劳动是没有分家的；人们决没有轻视体力劳动的观念。但到了阶级社会，剥削产生了，剥削阶级便专门依靠剥削别人的劳动成果来生活，完全脱离了体力劳动。剥削阶级为了维持他们的剥削秩序还建立了统治劳动人民的政权。这时，除了统治者帝王将相之外，还出现了所谓士大夫阶层，也就是为统治阶级服务的知识分子。他们把统治劳动者的工作叫作“劳心”，也就是我们所说的脑力劳动。从此，剥削阶级便把知识和文化垄断起来，当作自己的特权，而轻视从事体力劳动的人，把从事体力劳动的人看作贱民。于是，“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”也就成了阶级社会的金科玉律。总之，一切统治阶级都有一支为它服务的“士”或者知识分子的队伍。这些所谓知识分子都各以自己的一套统治或愚弄劳动人民的本领或知识为统治者所豢养和宠幸。其中一部分自然科学或技术方面的知识，成为人类文化的宝贵遗产被继承下来，但属于社会科学的绝大部分知识则是歪曲和鄙视劳动人民的谬论。封建社会的所谓“士”，资本主义社会的所谓知识分子，就是靠了这些所谓知识一方面为统治者尽忠效劳，另方面鄙视和压迫劳动人民。所谓“士为四民之首”，对统治者说他们是奴才，不妨卑躬屈节以达到向上爬的目的；但对劳动人民来说，他们又是老爷或先生。所以要摆摆架子，养成一副目中无人、妄自尊大的神气，“威仪棣棣”，使人见了肃然起敬。于是在他们的心目中为统治者服务的脑力劳动就有了了不起的高尚和尊贵的性质；而劳动人民所从事的生产劳动就成为鄙微不足道的贱役了。知识分子的这种优越感，是几千年来阶级社会所造成的，并且流行于各个社会，成为知识分子甚至劳动人民的传统观念。现在也还在支配着知识分子的思想和行动。“人力浪费论”就是这种思想在现时的翻版。可以说，这是阶级社会遗留给我们的有害的遗产之一。
    这种思想所以有害，是因为它拒绝知识分子的思想改造，坚持脑力劳动与体力劳动相脱离，理论与实际相脱离。所以在知识分子改造问题上也存在着两条路线的斗争：一条是脑力劳动与体力劳动相脱离的资本主义路线，一条是脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合的社会主义路线。
    我们坚持社会主义的脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合的路线。我们认为：体力劳动不仅是人类知识的来源，也是人类的真实的创造者。人类在从事物质资料生产的劳动过程中，不仅改造自然，使自然物为人类服务，而且也改造着人类自身，使人类逐渐由自然的奴隶成为自然的支配者，从蒙昧的原始人变作有知识有文化的现代人。因此，一切说得上是科学的知识，一开始都是从生产劳动和阶级斗争中得来而又返回来为生产服务、为阶级斗争服务的。现在我们实行社会主义革命，消灭了人剥削人的社会制度，正是创造了脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合，使工农业生产和科学文化事业飞跃发展的社会条件。要实现脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合的理想，首先就要使脱离劳动实践的资产阶级知识分子受到劳动锻炼，改造成为工人阶级的知识分子。然后他们才能够很好地为社会主义建设服务。因此，脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合，理论与实际相结合，就成为社会主义社会改造知识分子的坚定不移的方针。
    “人力浪费论”者也许不同意这个意见。他们也许会认为，他们不经过改造也是可以为社会主义建设服务的。或者说他们做教学工作、科学研究工作或其他业务行政工作，也同样是为社会主义建设服务，甚至能发挥更大的作用，而从事体力劳动就会妨碍他们在业务上的进步。这话似乎颇有些道理，其实却不尽然。我们要问，你的知识究竟有多少是有用的呢？从资产阶级学校学来的资产阶级的政治、经济、法律等等，不但绝大部分对社会主义建设无用，反而有害。这一点已经由反右派斗争的实践证明了，用不着多说。至于受过社会主义教育、学习过马列主义的知识分子，似乎应该承认他们用不着下厂下乡进行劳动锻炼就可以为社会主义服务了，但事实也决不是这样。道理很简单，因为知识分子既然要为社会主义服务，就必须熟悉社会主义建设的实际情况。我们所学的马列主义理论知识，固然很重要，但毕竟都是前人在当时的生产斗争和社会斗争中总结出来的经验。我们从这些知识中所能学到的只是解决问题的原则，决不是可以在任何情况下都可以依样画葫芦的教条。因为客观世界是无时无刻不在发展和变化的。我们所学到的知识，必须和当前的生产斗争和社会斗争相结合，在实际斗争中受到考验，才知道它是否有用。所以即使学了马列主义的理论，也必须到工厂和农村的基层单位去参加实际生活，才能使基本知识和现实相结合。这一点不论对社会科学的知识或自然科学的知识都是适用的。11月28日人民日报的一篇通讯里说：“农村的实际生活，还使人民大学的同志们发现了过去教学工作中的缺点。经济系的教员，过去在讲社会主义的农业时，对劳动力的组织、分配等方面，就有过不切实际的地方。比如，有人对工分和劳动日就混淆不清。经过这段劳动后，同志们对于劳动创造世界的问题，也有了具体的而不是抽象的体会。有人说，他们再回去讲这门课时，再也不会使人感到是教条主义了。”这个事实说明了没有经过实际考验的知识是虚假的、不可靠的。知识如果脱离了生产劳动和阶级斗争的实践，就会成为僵死的教条。通讯中提到的人民大学的同志们在没有下乡之前，大概是不会怀疑他们的知识的，但一经下乡之后，就发现了他们自己的知识有不切实际的毛病。至于其他没有下乡的知识分子的知识，大概也不会例外。可见我们所谓的知识，都应该到劳动的实践中实事求是地加以验证，去伪存真，去粗留精，才能成为可靠的、有用的知识。这样才叫做科学的态度。那种认为参加劳动会妨碍业务进步的思想是没有根据的。实际生活告诉我们，有些自封为知识分子的自以为是钢材的人，其实也许是一套绣花枕头，见火即焚，没有什么了不起的。
    因此，我们认为知识分子必须到劳动中去考验和改造自己，才能成为有用之才。“人力浪费论”可以休矣。
