Xinhua News Agency Report: Hebei Province's 35,000 agricultural cooperatives have the following characteristics in this year's autumn harvest distribution: increased income, faster distribution, and increased public accumulation.

This year, about 80% of the cooperatives in Hebei Province increased production, and 10% of the cooperatives did not increase or decrease production due to poor management. The vast majority of the 10% of the cooperatives that reduced production suffered from hail and drought. Based on actual production and distribution results, the number of cooperatives that reached or exceeded the production level of rich middle peasants has doubled compared to previous surveys based on estimated production, reaching 10,379 cooperatives, accounting for 26.7% of the province's agricultural cooperatives. In Tangshan Prefecture, agricultural cooperatives that reached or exceeded the production level of rich middle peasants accounted for 77% of the total number of cooperatives. More than 80% of farm households in the province have increased their income compared to before joining the cooperatives. More than half of the 905,500 cooperative member households in Tangshan Prefecture saw their income increase by 30% to 100% compared to last year.

Before and during the distribution process, all levels from the province to the county made full preparations and conducted inspections. In particular, the development of the rural socialist education movement has generally improved the consciousness of cooperative members and cadres. Therefore, various contradictions in the distribution have been smoothly resolved. Most places completed the distribution more than a month ahead of schedule.

Due to increased income, the public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives has generally increased from 1% to 5% last year to 5% to 8%. At the same time, the amount of grain sold to the state has also increased. Tangshan Prefecture alone sold more than 300 million jin more than the "three fix" quota, reaching 800 million jin.

    公共积累增加社员收入也多
    河北加紧进行秋收分配
    据新华社讯　河北省三万五千个农业社今年秋收分配的特点是：收入多，分配快，公共积累增加。
    今年河北省有80％左右的社增产，有10％的社因为管理工作差，不增不减。10％的减产社，绝大多数是因为受了雹灾和旱灾。根据实际产量和分配结果看，赶上或超过富裕中农生产水平的社，比过去按预计产量所作的调查又增加了一倍，达到一万零三百七十九个社，占全省农业社的26.7％。唐山专区赶上或超过富裕中农生产水平的农业社，占总社数的77％。全省80％以上的农户都比入社前增加了收入。唐山专区的九十万五千五百多户社员，有半数以上收入比去年增加30％到一倍。
    在分配前和分配过程中，由省到县各级都作了充分准备，并进行检查，特别是农村社会主义教育运动的开展，社员和社干部的觉悟普遍提高，因此分配中的各种矛盾都顺利解决。多数地方完成分配的时间都提前了一个多月。
    由于收入增加，农业社的公共积累一般由去年的1％到5％，扩大到5％到8％；同时缴售给国家的粮食也增多了。仅唐山专区就比“三定”多缴售三亿多斤，达到八亿斤。
