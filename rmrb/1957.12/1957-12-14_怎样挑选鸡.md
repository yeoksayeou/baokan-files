    How to Choose a Chicken
　　Cui Sen
    When buying a chicken, how can you distinguish its quality, and how can you tell the difference between male and female, old and young?
    Whether a live chicken is sick can be checked by its external appearance and sensory inspection. A healthy chicken is energetic and lively, with tight feathers that are glossy, and a high-held tail; its comb and wattle are bright red, and its eyes are bright, with a red face. A sick chicken is listless, with ruffled feathers, drooping wings; its comb and wattle are often purple, white, or dark brown; when you touch its breast muscles or crop, you find that the breast muscles are stiff (not flexible) or the crop is swollen with gas.
    Freshly slaughtered chicken: cleanly plucked, the skin is clear white (spring chicken is reddish-yellow), the meat is plump, and the fat is transparent. Unfreshly slaughtered chicken: the skin is bluish-purple, dull, and without luster.
    Distinguishing between male and female chickens: Generally speaking, roosters are tall and have long legs, with larger combs and wattles; hens are short and have short legs, with smaller combs and wattles. At the same time, you should also observe the tail of the chicken. The rooster's tail has little meat, and the end is pointed; the hen's tail has more meat, and the end is round.
    Chicken's age: When distinguishing the age of a chicken, you should look at the claws, look at the soles, and look at the "qu" (the so-called "qu" is the protruding thing between the wrist on the inside of the chicken's left and right legs). The claws of old chickens are worn smooth and bald, the soles of the feet are thick and stiff; the protrusion between the leg wrists is longer (the older it is, the longer it gets, and when it is large, it looks like a toe). The claws of young chickens are pointed and not much worn, the soles of the feet are thin and not stiff, and the protrusions between the leg wrists are also smaller. Especially for spring chickens, there is almost no protrusion between the wrists; when you look closely, there is only a small circular dot, and when you touch it with your hand, it feels slightly prickly.

    怎样挑选鸡
　　崔森
    买鸡时怎样鉴别它的质量好坏，怎样辨别鸡的雌雄与老嫩呢？
    毛鸡（活鸡）是否有病，可以从外貌感官检查。健康鸡精神活泼，羽毛紧密，色泽光亮，尾部高耸；冠与肉髯鲜红，并且眼睛发光，颜面呈现红色。病鸡则精神萎缩，羽毛蓬乱，翅膀下垂；冠与肉髯多呈紫色、白色或暗褐色；用手按摸其胸肌或嗉囊时，发现胸肌僵硬（不灵活）或嗉囊膨胀气肿。
    新鲜水鸡：拔毛干净，皮色清白（笋鸡红黄），肉质肥厚，脂肪透明。不新鲜水鸡：皮色青紫、暗淡无光。
    辨别鸡的雌雄：一般地说，公鸡身高腿长，冠与肉髯较大；母鸡身矮腿短，冠与肉髯较小。同时还要察看鸡只的尾巴。公鸡尾巴肉少，尾端尖尖；母鸡尾巴肉多，尾端呈圆形。
    鸡的老嫩：辨别鸡的老嫩时，应该看爪、看掌、看曲（所谓曲是在鸡的左右两腿内侧腕间凸出的东西）。老鸡的爪尖磨损光秃，脚掌皮厚，而且僵硬；腿腕间的凸出物较长（愈老愈长，大时像个足趾）。嫩鸡的爪尖尖，磨损不大，脚掌皮薄而无僵硬现象，腿腕间的凸出物也较小。尤其是笋鸡，腕间凸出物几乎没有，仔细看时，仅有一圆形小点，用手触之，稍觉刺手。
