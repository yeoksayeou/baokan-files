Southwest Restores Another Foreign Trade Route
　　滇越 Railway Connected

　　Xinhua News Agency, Mengzi, 18th. Railway soldiers repairing the Bisezhai-Hekou section of the 滇越 Railway laid the last rail at Luogu Station this morning.  With this, the northern and southern sections of the Bisezhai-Hekou section have been connected, and the 滇越 Railway, which has been interrupted for fifteen years, has been reconnected.  From now on, Southwest China has restored another foreign trade route; the connection between the mountainous areas inhabited by ethnic minorities on the Yunnan border and the interior of the motherland will also be closer.

　　The Bisezhai-Hekou section of the 滇越 Railway is 177 kilometers long. This section of the railway was cut off by the Kuomintang reactionary government during the Anti-Japanese War, and all the rails and most of the bridges were completely destroyed.

　　The repair project of this line started in August last year, with track laying simultaneously from the north and south ends. The northern section was laid southward from Bisezhai, and the southern section was laid northward from Hekou, which borders China and Vietnam. The railway soldiers of a certain unit were responsible for the repair project of this line. Together with the local laborers, they overcame the subtropical heat and continuous rain on this line with narrow roadbeds, sharp curves, and many bridge and tunnel projects, and finally repaired the 滇越 Railway, which had been interrupted for fifteen years, after more than a year.

　　西南又恢复一条对外贸易的通道
    滇越铁路接通
    据新华社蒙自18日电　修复滇越铁路碧河段的铁道兵今天早晨在倮姑车站铺好最后一根钢轨。至此，碧河段南北两段已经接轨，中断十五年的滇越铁路接通了。我国西南地区从此又恢复了一条对外贸易的通道；云南边疆少数民族聚居的山区同祖国内地的联系也更加密切了。
    滇越铁路碧（色寨）河（口）段全长一百七十七公里。这段铁路在抗日战争时期被国民党反动政府割断，全部钢轨和大部分桥梁都被破坏殆尽。
    这段线路的修复工程是去年8月开始，从南北两头同时铺轨。北段由碧色寨向南铺轨，南段由中越两国交界的河口向北铺轨。担任这段线路修复工程的是铁道兵某部。他们同当地民工一起，在这条路基窄、弯道急、桥梁和隧道工程极多的线路上，战胜了亚热带的酷暑和霪雨，经过一年多的时间，终于把中断了十五年的滇越铁路修复了。
