    Mobile Food Cart
    One day, I went to the cooperative to buy a piece of alkali. As soon as I walked out of the street gate, I saw a small cart. I asked and found out it was a mobile food cart. The cart happened to have alkali, so I bought a piece right away. It was a brand-new, sky-blue cart, and many people were gathered around it buying things. The cart had no less than twenty or thirty kinds of items.
    The mobile cart was added during the rectification campaign. Before we had the mobile cart, people had to go to the cooperative on the main street to buy things, but now it is much more convenient.

    副食品流动车
    有一天，我到合作社去买一块碱，刚走出街门，看见一辆小车，一问才知是副食品流动车。车上恰巧就备了碱，我马上就买了一块。这是一辆簇新的天蓝色的小车，周围正围着许多人在买东西。小车上的东西不下二、三十种。
    流动车是在整风中添设的，原来没有流动车的时候，人们买东西要到大街合作社，现在可就方便多了。
