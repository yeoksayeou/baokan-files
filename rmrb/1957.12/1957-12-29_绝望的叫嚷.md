    Desperate Cries
    Baldwin, the military commentator of the "New York Times," frantically advocated for an arms race in an article, saying, "There must be cannons before butter; there must be missiles before televisions." He even suggested that the American people should no longer sing the old American song "I Didn't Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier."
    Baldwin's frantic cries are even more thorough than the "more guns, less butter" slogan of U.S. Secretary of Commerce Weeks, and even more reflect the desperate mood of a small group of warmongers in the United States. Because they are not only enemies of the people, but they cannot even tolerate old American songs.
    Butter and televisions may be taken away from the people, but the old songs that the American people love are a force that Baldwin and his ilk cannot resist.

    绝望的叫嚷
    “纽约时报”军事评论员鲍德温在一篇文章中疯狂地鼓吹军备竞赛，他说：“必须先有大炮，然后再有牛油；必须先有导弹，然后再有电视机。”他甚至提出，不许美国人民再唱“我把我的孩子养大不是为了要他去当兵”那首美国的古老歌曲。
    鲍德温的这种疯狂叫嚷，比起美国商务部长威克斯的“多一些大炮，少一些牛油”的口号是更加彻底，也更加反映出美国的一小撮战争贩子们的绝望心情。因为他们不仅与人民为敌，并且连美国古老歌曲都不能容忍了。
    牛油和电视机也许能从人民手中夺走，但是美国人民喜爱的古老歌曲却是鲍德温之流无法对抗的力量。
