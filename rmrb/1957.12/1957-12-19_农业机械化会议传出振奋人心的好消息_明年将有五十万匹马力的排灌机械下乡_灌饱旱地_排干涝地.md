Xinhua News Agency, December 18th: Heartening news from the Agricultural Mechanization Conference: Next year, China will supply 500,000 horsepower of power irrigation and drainage machinery to rural areas for drainage and irrigation, in order to increase yield per unit area. This was decided at the National Farmland Irrigation and Drainage Machinery and Agricultural Mechanization Conference which closed on the 16th. Of this 500,000 horsepower of power machinery, 200,000 horsepower will be manufactured and delivered before April next year.

Each set of these 500,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery includes a power engine and a water pump or waterwheel used simultaneously. The largest set is 120 horsepower, the smallest is 3-5 horsepower, and the average is about 10 horsepower per set. If these machines are used well, they can irrigate or drain about 20 million mu of farmland. With processing machinery, these power engines can also be used for sideline processing such as milling flour, husking rice, and pressing oil.

Among the power engines for these irrigation and drainage machines, gas engines account for more than 300,000 horsepower, while steam engines (i.e., locomobiles), electric motors, and diesel engines are only tens of thousands of horsepower. Because China currently lacks oil, it is not suitable to develop diesel engines on a large scale, and electric motors are limited by power supply and cannot be widely used at present. Locomobiles are "honest and reliable," easy to operate, and not particular about fuel, so they are loved by farmers, but they consume too much steel and are bulky, and the boiler steel plates also need to be imported from abroad, and fuel consumption is also high. Gas engines are light and save materials. The average weight of a gas engine per horsepower is only about one-fourth that of a locomobile, and it has high thermal efficiency, saves fuel, and can burn anthracite coal, charcoal, semi-coke, or firewood; however, the quality requirements for design and manufacturing are high, and operation and maintenance are more difficult. In some areas, fuel is also subject to certain restrictions. These difficulties can still be solved by taking corresponding measures. According to the current conditions in China where steel and oil are relatively scarce, the conference decided, after research, to focus on gas engines as the current key to the development of rural power machinery in China.

After the promulgation of the Forty Articles for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft), a mass production upsurge has begun to appear in rural areas of China. Many places want to turn dry land into paddy fields, and want to change from planting one crop to planting two or even three crops a year. Coupled with intensive cultivation, during the busy farming season, there is a shortage of manpower and animal power everywhere. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives universally demand to purchase machinery, especially drainage and irrigation machinery. At the meeting, the numbers of irrigation and drainage machinery requested by various places were submitted several times a day, eventually reaching 1.12 million horsepower. This number is more than twice the cumulative total of all power irrigation and drainage machinery in rural China in the past forty years. In 1949, China's rural power machinery had only 97,000 horsepower; after several years of development, it reached 540,000 horsepower this year. Due to the continuing difficulties with raw materials and the need to strictly guarantee quality, and the lack of experience of farmers in operating the machinery, it will not be possible to fully meet the requirements of agricultural cooperatives next year. However, preparations are also being made to increase the production target to 700,000 horsepower, or even more, after Qingming Festival next year, depending on the development of the situation. The meeting believed that while developing power irrigation and drainage machinery, it is necessary to fully utilize the potential of existing manpower and animal power, and actively carry out livestock breeding work.

The meeting unanimously agreed that it is necessary to ensure that these machines are easy to use and can be used frequently. Therefore, the meeting decided to take a series of measures to achieve this goal. The meeting decided that which factories can produce these machines must be reviewed and approved by the central departments; the product drawings and data shall be uniformly supplied by the First Ministry of Machine Building during production, and shall not be changed at will; the products must undergo strict appraisal before leaving the factory, and unqualified products shall not be allowed to leave the factory. The meeting suggested that the people's committees of all provinces and cities organize local repair and maintenance forces to establish comprehensive repair stations and a repair and maintenance network for agricultural machinery, and the original manufacturers should be responsible for supplying the necessary main spare parts. The meeting believed that it is very important for drivers to master operating techniques, and suggested that all provinces and cities train 100,000 people to be drivers. These personnel can be selected from demobilized soldiers, transferred cadres, and junior high school graduates, and instructors will be dispatched by the industrial departments.

The meeting also decided to lower the price of machinery to better support water conservancy construction.

The meeting also studied the development plan for agricultural machinery in China, and made preliminary arrangements for the promotion of double-wheel double-furrow plows and other new agricultural tools next year.

The meeting was jointly convened by the State Economic Commission, the Ministry of Water Conservancy, the Ministry of Agriculture, the First Ministry of Machine Building, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and lasted for two weeks. More than 500 people attended the meeting, including leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel from industrial, water conservancy, agricultural, and supply and marketing departments of various provinces and cities, and personnel from relevant central departments.

During the meeting, Huang Jing, Director of the State Technology Commission, made a report on agricultural mechanization, and Vice Premiers of the State Council Bo Yibo and Deng Zihui also attended the meeting and gave important instructions. (Attached picture)

　　农业机械化会议传出振奋人心的好消息
    明年将有五十万匹马力的排灌机械下乡
    灌饱旱地　排干涝地
    新华社18日讯　明年我国将供应五十万匹马力的动力排灌机械，给农村排涝和灌溉，以提高单位面积产量。这是16日闭幕的全国农田排灌机械及农业机械化会议决定的。在这五十万匹马力的动力机械中有二十万匹马力将在明年4月以前制成交货。
    这五十万匹马力的排灌机械，每套都有动力机和同时使用的水泵或水车。最大的每套一百二十马力，最小的每套三、五马力，平均每套十马力左右。这些机械如果运用得好，可以进行灌溉或排水约二千万亩左右的田地。有了加工机械以后，这些动力机还可以用来作磨面、碾米、榨油等副业加工。
    在这些排灌机械的动力机中，煤气机占三十多万马力，蒸气机（即锅驼机）、电动机、柴油机都只有几万马力。因为目前我国石油缺乏，不宜大量发展柴油机，电动机受电源的限制，目前还不能普遍采用。锅驼机“忠厚老实”，容易操纵，又不拘燃料，为农民所喜爱，但是太费钢材，而且笨重，锅炉钢板还需从国外进口，燃料消耗量也大。煤气机轻巧省材料，平均每马力的煤气机的重量只及锅驼机的四分之一左右，而且热效率高，省燃料，可以烧无烟煤，也可以烧木炭、半焦或木柴；但是在设计和制造上质量要求高，操纵和保养比较难。有些地区燃料也受到一定的限制。这些困难只要采取相应措施，也还是可以解决的。根据目前我国钢铁和石油都比较少的条件，会议经过研究，确定以煤气机为目前我国农村动力机械发展的重点。
    发展农业的四十条纲要（修正草案）发布以后，在我国农村已开始出现了一个群众性的生产高潮。许多地方要把旱地变水田，要把种一季改成种两季甚至种三季。加上精耕细作，农忙季节，到处都出现人力畜力不足的现象。因此，农业社普遍要求购买机械，特别是要求排涝和灌溉的机械。会上，各地提出要排灌机械的数字一日数张，最后达到一百一十二万匹马力。这个数字等于我国四十几年来农村所有动力排灌机械累积总数的两倍还多。1949年我国农村动力机械只有九万七千马力；经过几年的发展，今年达到五十四万马力。由于原材料还有困难，又要严格保证质量，农民操纵还缺乏经验，明年还不可能完全满足农业社的要求。但是也准备在明年清明节后根据情况的发展把生产指标增加到七十万马力，或者更多一些。会议认为，在发展动力排灌机械的同时，必须充分发挥现有人畜力的潜力，并且积极进行繁殖牲畜的工作。
    会议一致认为必须保证这些机器好用，并且能经常使用。因此，会议决定采取一系列措施达到这个目的。会议决定哪些厂可以生产这些机器，必须经过中央部门审定；生产时产品图纸资料统一由第一机械工业部指定供应，不得随意改动；产品出厂前必须经过严格鉴定，不合格的不能出厂。会议建议各省市人民委员会把地方修配力量组织起来，建立综合修理站和农业机械的修配网，必需的主要配件由原生产厂负责供应。会议认为司机手掌握操作技术非常重要，建议由各省市训练十万人员来作司机手。这些人员可由转业军人、下放干部、初中毕业生中选拔，教员由工业部门派遣。
    会议并决定降低机械价格，以更有利地支援兴修水利。
    会议还对我国农业机械的发展规划作了研究，并且对明年推广双轮双铧犁和其他新式农具作了初步安排。
    会议由国家经济委员会、水利部、农业部、第一机械工业部、全国供销合作总社联合召开，历时两星期。出席会议的约五百多人，包括各省市工业、水利、农业、供销部门，以及有关企业的领导干部、工程技术人员和中央各有关部门的人员。
    会议期间，国家技术委员会主任黄敬作了关于农业机械化问题的报告，国务院副总理薄一波和邓子恢，也到会作了重要指示。（附图片）
