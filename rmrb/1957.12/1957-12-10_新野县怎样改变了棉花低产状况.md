How Xinye County Changed the Low Cotton Yield Situation
Deputy County Magistrate of Xinye County, Henan Province, Xiao Zhongfu

Xinye County is located in the southwest of Henan Province. The cotton growing areas are scattered, and the yield is very low. Before liberation, the average yield per mu in the county was only about ten catties of ginned cotton; in 1955, the average yield was 14.4 catties of ginned cotton. In 1956, after the realization of advanced collectivization, the average cotton yield increased to 33.6 catties. This year, the average yield on more than 173,000 mu of cotton fields in the county has increased to 53 catties of ginned cotton. At the same time, there was one cooperative producing 100 catties of ginned cotton per mu, and 32 production teams producing 100 catties of ginned cotton per mu. The total area of cotton fields with a yield of more than 100 catties of ginned cotton per mu in the county reached 3,245 mu, and there were 12 mu of high-yielding fields with a yield of more than 200 catties of ginned cotton per mu, of which 2 mu reached an average yield of 290 catties of ginned cotton per mu. The long-standing low cotton yield situation in Xinye County has undergone significant changes, which has further criticized the conservative thinking of cadres and the masses, and laid the foundation for future yield increases.

The yield of 53 catties of ginned cotton per mu achieved by Xinye County is not outstanding compared with many high-yield counties. However, compared with the average yield of this county before 1955, it has increased by nearly three times. At the same time, many 100-catty cotton fields have appeared this year, which proves that Xinye County still has great potential for increasing cotton production.

Xinye County has been able to rapidly change the low cotton yield situation and achieve a leap forward in production. From the perspective of our organizational leadership, the following are the main experiences:

First, because the cotton fields in this county account for only about 14% of the cultivated land, the proportion is relatively small, and it has not attracted enough attention from us. In the past two years, we have regarded the low cotton yield problem as a prominent problem in agricultural production to be solved. It was decided that under the unified leadership of the county party committee, 9,133 cadres, including deputy county magistrates, deputy leaders of the county party committee and various work groups, secretaries of the Communist Youth League branches in the townships, directors of the Women's Federation, deputy directors of agricultural cooperatives, deputy captains of production teams, and technical extension personnel, would be organized to specifically guide cotton production increase. The county, work groups, townships, and cooperatives all grasp the key points at each level to create experience to promote all-round progress. In addition to grasping the cotton production season and implementing yield-increasing measures one after another, the leadership must also promptly supervise relevant economic departments to do a good job in the supply of means of production.

Second, organize cotton specialized teams to manage cotton fields. In the era of small-scale peasant economy, the cotton fields here were scattered, with one or two mu per household, which were only attached crops, and the peasants did not pay attention to processing and management. The local people also believed that cotton planted in good land would grow wildly, and most of them were planted in barren land. This is the basic reason for the low cotton yield. After collectivization, under the strong leadership of the Party, we carried out rational planning and adjustment of cotton fields in the county: on the one hand, we emphasized planting according to local conditions, and adjusted cotton fields that were originally in barren land and low-lying and easily flooded land to higher and better land as much as possible; at the same time, in each agricultural cooperative, the scattered cotton fields were appropriately concentrated into contiguous areas, and cotton production specialized teams were established. It is stipulated that every three to five mu of cotton fields should be fixed with one labor force, with division of labor and contracting, clear responsibilities, and responsible for regular operations in the cotton fields. During the critical periods of pest control, the cooperative mobilized manpower for short-term assaults to ensure the completion of the cotton field management tasks. Due to the adoption of these measures, the phenomenon of neglecting the management of cotton production has been changed, and the production technology has been improved and enhanced due to the establishment of specialized personnel management.

Third, in view of the fact that the low level of cotton planting technology and the weakness of technical guidance forces are one of the main reasons for low yield, last year the province transferred a group of cotton planting experts from Anyang Prefecture to provide specific help, impart technical experience, and improve production tools. This year, the county extracted nearly 100 party members and activists with cotton planting experience from agricultural cooperatives to participate in key agricultural cooperatives in the new cotton areas, with two to four people per cooperative, serving as deputy captains of production teams or technical section chiefs and technicians of agricultural cooperatives, etc., working for one season before returning to their original cooperatives. This method of guidance is a very effective way to improve the technical level of low-yield areas. In addition, the county also used various methods to train more than 20,000 cotton planting technical backbones, and encouraged technicians to take apprentices, training more than 7,000 technical personnel, which greatly strengthened the strength of technical guidance.

Fourth, in the past two years, we have vigorously implemented comprehensive technical improvements and comprehensively improved cotton planting technology. Now the cotton fields have all implemented winter plowing, and are gradually deepening the depth of plowing. Last winter, a large-scale fertilizer accumulation and delivery campaign was carried out for two months, and basal fertilizer was applied to each mu of cotton field, and two top dressings were applied during the cotton growth period. In the past, cotton sowing generally had to be delayed until late April, but this year, according to local conditions, it was sown more than 20 days earlier. In the past, the sowing method was broadcasting, but now it has been completely changed to strip sowing. In the past, it was sparse planting, but this year it has been increased to 3,000 to 4,000 plants per mu. In the past, there was generally no habit of pest control, but this year, general cotton fields are treated for pests at least three or four times, and pest damage has been basically overcome. In the past, cotton did not pay attention to management techniques such as seedling protection, middle plowing, and pruning, but this year, technical measures have been comprehensively strengthened.

In the implementation of these technical improvement works, the leadership adopted methods such as ideological mobilization, learning while doing, in-depth inspection, and evaluation and competition. First of all, we must strengthen political and ideological education, fully mobilize cadres and the masses, and break conservative thinking. At the same time, guide agricultural cooperatives to earnestly implement the "four fixed quotas" contracting method of "fixing people, fixing land, fixing output, and fixing work points", and implement over-production rewards to stimulate the enthusiasm of cooperative members to increase production and ensure the implementation of production increase measures.

In order to deepen the cotton production increase campaign, in addition to the townships and cooperatives conducting multiple inspections, the county party committee organized three large-scale county-wide inspections, evaluations, and team standings. Through inspections, problems are discovered in a timely manner and solved at any time. For the third category of cotton fields, emergency measures should be taken immediately to change the backward phenomena within a time limit. Through these measures, the movement can be developed in a balanced manner and achieve the goal of comprehensive and balanced production increase.

At present, the work of drought resistance and drainage in cotton fields is still poorly done, the density of cotton fields can still be increased, and there are many places where technology needs to be improved. However, as long as we continue to strengthen leadership, continuously improve production conditions, and improve technology, cotton production can still leap forward.

　　新野县怎样改变了棉花低产状况
　　河南省新野县副县长　萧忠夫
    新野县在河南省的西南部。棉区分散，而且产量很低。解放前，全县平均每亩仅产皮棉十斤左右；1955年平均产皮棉十四点四斤。1956年实现高级合作化后，棉花平均产量提高到三十三点六斤。今年，全县十七万三千多亩棉田，平均产量提高到皮棉五十三斤。同时出现了百斤皮棉社一个，百斤皮棉生产队三十二个。全县亩产百斤皮棉以上的棉田共达三千二百四十五亩，并有亩产皮棉二百斤以上的高额丰产田十二亩，其中有二亩产量达到平均每亩产皮棉二百九十斤。新野县历年来棉花低产的面貌有了明显的变化，这个事实又进一步批判了干部和群众中的保守思想，为今后的增产打下了基础。
    新野县获得亩产皮棉五十三斤的产量，比起许多高产县来并不算突出。但是，和1955年以前这县的平均产量比起来，就已经提高了将近三倍，同时今年还出现了许多百斤皮棉的棉田，这又证明新野县的棉花增产潜力仍然很大。
    新野县能够迅速改变棉花低产面貌，获得跃进增产，从我们组织领导工作方面看，有以下几点主要经验：
    第一、由于这县的棉田仅占耕地的14％左右，比重较小，未引起我们足够的重视。近两年来，我们将棉花低产问题当作农业生产上的突出问题来解决，决定在县委统一领导下，组织副县长，县委、各工作组的副组长，乡的团支部书记，妇联主任，农业社的副社长，生产队的副队长，以及技术推广人员共九千一百三十三个干部，专门负责棉花增产的具体指导。县、工作组、乡、社均层层掌握重点，创造经验以推动全面。领导上除抓住棉花生产季节，一环扣一环地贯彻增产措施外，另一方面，又需及时督促有关经济部门，做好生产资料的供应工作。
    第二、组织棉花专业队，专人管理棉田。在小农经济时代，这里的棉田是零星分散的，每户一、二亩，仅是附带作物，农民不注意加工管理。当地群众还认为棉花种在好地上会长疯，大都是种在瘠薄的土地上。这是造成棉花低产的基本原因。合作化后，在党的大力领导下，我们对县内棉田进行了合理的规划和调整：一方面强调因地种植，将原来在瘠薄的土地、低洼易涝的土地上的棉田，尽可能调整到高地、好地上去；同时，在各个农业社里将零星分散的棉田，适当地集中连片起来，成立棉花生产专业队，规定每三到五亩棉田固定一个劳动力，分工包块，明确责任，负责棉田经常作业。在治虫等紧要关头时，由社调动人力，短期突击，以保证完成棉田管理任务。由于采取了这样一些措施，就改变了不注意棉花生产的经营管理的现象，并因设了专人经营，生产技术也得到了改进和提高。
    第三、鉴于植棉技术水平很低，技术指导力量弱是造成低产的主要原因之一，去年即由省从安阳专区调了一批老棉区的植棉能手，组成技术辅导团，来这里进行具体帮助，传授技术经验，改良生产工具。今年又由县从农业社里抽出近百名植棉有经验的党团员和积极分子，到新棉区参加重点的农业社，每社二到四人，担任生产队副队长或农业社的技术股长、技术员等，工作一个季后返回原社。这样进行辅导方法，是提高低产地区的技术水平很有效的办法。另外，县里又采用各种方式训练了二万多名植棉技术骨干，并鼓励技术人员带徒弟，培养了七千多名技术人员，大大加强了技术指导的力量。
    第四、两年来我们大力实施了综合性的改进技术，全面地提高了植棉技术。现在棉田已全部实行冬耕，并逐步在加深耕地深度。去冬开展了两个月大规模的积肥送肥运动，每亩棉田上了基肥，并在棉花生长期间，加施两次追肥。过去棉花播种一般要迟到4月下旬，今年根据当地具体条件，提早二十多天播种。播种方法过去是撒播，现已全部改为条播。过去是稀植，今年已增加到每亩三千到四千株。过去一般无治虫习惯，今年一般棉田最少治虫三、四次，基本上克服了虫害。过去棉花不注意保苗、中耕、整枝等管理技术，今年也已全面地加强了技术措施。
    在贯彻这些技术改进工作中，领导上采取了思想动员、边学边做、深入检查、评比竞赛等方法。首先是加强政治思想教育，充分发动干部和群众，打破保守思想。同时指导农业社切实贯彻“定人、定地、定产、定工分”的四定包工办法，实行超产奖励，以刺激社员的增产积极性，保证增产措施的实施。
    为了使棉花增产运动深入开展，今年除乡、社分别进行多次的检查外，县委组织了三次全县范围的大检查、大评比、大站队。通过检查，及时发现问题，随时加以解决。对三类棉田则立即采取突击措施，限期改变落后现象。通过这些措施，使得运动平衡发展，达到全面平衡增产的目的。
    目前棉田抗旱排涝工作还做得差，棉田密度还可以增加，技术也有许多地方需要改进。但是，只要继续加强领导，不断改善生产条件，提高技术，棉花产量还可以向前跃进。
