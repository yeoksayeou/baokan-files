　　Frosty Leaves Redder Than February Flowers

　　In late autumn, the red leaves on Beijing's Western Hills and Nanjing's Qixia Mountain attract so many tourists! Why do the red leaves compete to redden the landscape when other leaves are withering and yellowing?

　　It turns out that besides the green chlorophyll, tree leaves also contain other pigments: yellow xanthophyll and carotene, as well as anthocyanins (note) that can present red colors. In spring and summer, with ample sunlight and warm weather, chlorophyll is produced in large quantities, and xanthophyll or anthocyanins are covered up, so the leaves appear green.

　　But interestingly, although sunlight can promote the production of chlorophyll, it can also promote the decomposition of chlorophyll. In the warm season, more chlorophyll is produced than decomposed, and the leaves are always green. In autumn, the temperature is low, chlorophyll can hardly be produced, but the decomposition effect of sunlight on chlorophyll continues as usual. The chlorophyll in the leaves is therefore only consumed and not replenished, and the colors of other pigments become apparent.

　　At this time, the leaves containing xanthophyll and carotene begin to turn yellow; the leaves containing anthocyanins show red, such as the leaves of smoke trees, varnish trees, red maples, etc. Because anthocyanin is the opposite of chlorophyll, it is easier to produce at lower temperatures, so the leaves of red maples and other trees become more and more lovely in late autumn. This is the reason why the red leaves on the Western Hills and Qixia Mountain can attract tourists to linger in the autumn.

　　Note: Anthocyanins are able to change color. In an acidic environment, anthocyanins appear red; in an alkaline environment, they are blue; and in a neutral environment, they are purple. (Lou Chuncong)

### 霜叶红于二月花

　　霜叶红于二月花
    深秋时节，北京西山和南京栖霞山上的红叶吸引了多少游客啊！为什么当其他树叶都枯黄憔悴的时候，红叶却在那里争相映红呢？
    原来树木的叶子里面，除了绿色的叶绿素外，还含有其他色素：黄色的叶黄素和胡萝卜素，以及能够呈现红色的花青素（注）。春夏季节，阳光充足，气候温暖，叶绿素大量生成，叶黄素或花青素就被遮盖起来，所以树叶呈现绿色。
    但有趣的是，阳光虽能促进叶绿素的生成，同时也能促使叶绿素的分解。在温暖的季节里，叶绿素生成的多，分解的少，树叶始终是绿色。秋天，气温低了，叶绿素几乎不能生成，而阳光对叶绿素的分解作用却照常进行，树叶中的叶绿素因此只有消耗而没有补充，别的色素的颜色就显现出来了。
    这时，那些含有叶黄素和胡萝卜素的叶子就开始变黄了；含有花青素的叶子就显出红色，如黄栌、桖树、红枫等的叶子。因为花青素同叶绿素相反。它在较低的温度下反而容易生成，所以越到深秋红枫等树木的叶子越是红得可爱。这就是西山和栖霞山上的红叶能够在秋天逗引游客流连忘返的缘故。
    注：花青素是能够变色的。在酸性环境中，花青素呈红色；在碱性环境中为蓝色；在中性环境中是紫色。　（楼春聪）
