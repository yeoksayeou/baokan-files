Agencies Reassured, Cadres Satisfied, Localities Welcomed
Ministry of Public Security Achieves Good Results Through Thorough Ideological Work in Sending Cadres Down

(Our reporter Lian Yunshan reports) The Ministry of Public Security's work of sending cadres down, carried out according to the principle of "unified arrangement and comprehensive training," has come to a successful conclusion. In carrying out this work, the Ministry of Public Security repeatedly conducted ideological mobilization for all personnel; mobilized the masses to raise questions and present difficulties, and fully discussed the significance of sending cadres down; from proposing lists and finalizing lists to arranging placements in rural areas, the mass line and the spirit of being responsible to the end were consistently implemented, achieving good results. Now the sent-down cadres have happily arrived in the countryside to engage in labor. All personnel have also received a vivid political education and cadre policy education through this work.

Recently, this reporter specifically interviewed a person in charge of the Ministry of Public Security, who described in detail the experiences in doing a good job of sending cadres down. He said: Repeatedly explaining the important significance of cadres going down to engage in labor to all cadres, and organizing thorough discussions in the form of forums, with responsible cadres holding individual talks with sent-down cadres to conduct meticulous ideological work, is the primary key to doing this work well. As early as November, after Minister Luo Ruiqing reported to all cadres on the various important significances of sending a group of people down for labor training, a surge of big-character posters requesting to go down for labor immediately arose; within three days, the number of applicants reached 96% of all cadres. However, according to the Party group's analysis at the time and the subsequent exposure of cadres' thoughts, it was confirmed that among the 96% of people who requested to go down for labor, only about 20% had a relatively correct understanding and were truly determined; about 75% were in an intermediate state, followed the crowd, and had not truly made up their minds; although they signed up, 5% were ideologically resistant, believing that sending cadres down for labor was the leadership's way of "dumping burdens." The majority of those in the intermediate state generally lacked sufficient understanding of sending cadres down for labor as a fundamental measure to cultivate and create a proletarian cadre force and overcome the three bad styles of state organs. They believed that they had signed up themselves, but if they were really asked to go, they would be considered untrustworthy. Among young intellectual cadres, many had various concerns about going down, such as fear of being unaccustomed to life, fear of not eating well, fear of not being able to take a bath, fear of not being able to watch movies, fear of not being able to find a spouse, fear of not being able to hear reports, and so on. Some veteran cadres from worker-peasant backgrounds and with a longer history of struggle believed that they had already undergone labor training, so although they signed up, they were not seriously prepared to engage in labor training.

Based on the above situation, the Party group of the Ministry of Public Security first grasped the work of repeatedly conducting political and ideological mobilization to improve the level of understanding. It organized all cadres to listen to Premier Zhou's speech at the Foreign Ministry's rally to send off personnel going down for labor training. The Ministry's leading comrades also continued to conduct in-depth ideological mobilization in light of the cadres' ideological understanding; at the same time, it organized all cadres to visit the Liu Jiemai's past and present life exhibition. The organs' cultural and recreational activities also cooperated with this work, selecting and screening movies related to building mountain areas and building the countryside. These activities played a certain role in helping cadres correctly understand the significance of going down for labor.

Group Discussions, Individual Talks: What Exactly is Labor Training For?

On the basis of this ideological mobilization and education, the significance of going down for labor was then universally discussed in the form of forums, combined with one's own ideological understanding, presenting thoughts, presenting difficulties, and solving ideological and practical problems. The topics of the forums were roughly these: "Is going to the countryside for labor training a measure to cultivate cadres, or is it simply a measure to streamline the organization?" "What kind of cadres need labor training?" "Is going to the countryside for labor training progress or regression?" "What should we learn from the peasants when we go to the countryside?" "How should we train ourselves, and what should we pay attention to after going to the countryside?" and so on. Through this universal discussion of ideological problems, the masses' understanding was further improved. In order to do this work more meticulously, the heads of each department and the heads and deputy heads of each bureau held individual talks with the sent-down cadres. Some talked once, and some talked three or five times at most. Minister Luo Ruiqing and the vice ministers held collective talks with the sent-down cadres in groups of three, five, or more. After the above repeated, meticulous, and in-depth ideological work, the original firm ideas of the sent-down cadres became firmer, and the majority of those who were originally in an intermediate state eliminated their concerns and had a clearer understanding of the significance of going down. The proportion of positive elements rose to over 95%, and they put forward concrete plans to ensure that they would not be afraid of hardship, would work with the peasants, would respect grassroots cadres, and would resolutely transform themselves, forming a high tide of establishing covenants for going down to labor.

Unified Arrangement, Comprehensive Training: Those Staying and Those Leaving Are All Happy

Adhering to the cadre work policy of "unified arrangement and comprehensive training," and treating sending cadres down as an important part of rectification; from proposing the list of sent-down cadres to finally deciding the list, the working method of the mass line must always be adopted. This is the second important key to doing a good job of sending cadres down for labor. When the Ministry of Public Security began to mobilize cadres to go down, some bureau and department leading cadres, although they knew the important significance of sending cadres down to engage in labor production, had insufficient understanding when it came to specific implementation, especially when it came to proposing the list of sent-down cadres; because the Ministry of Public Security had already reduced half of its cadres in the spring of this year, and then transferred out hundreds of people, many leading comrades believed that there were really very few people who could be sent down; when the Party group held its first meeting to study the list, many bureaus shouted that it was difficult to draw people, and it would be difficult for all the sent-down cadres to reach one hundred people. Some bureaus, although they proposed a list, it was a list of choosing the weaker from the stronger, and keeping the stronger while sending the weaker. When some bureaus took this list to the masses for discussion, the effect was very bad. After the masses looked at the list, they questioned the significance of sending cadres down. Some people asked whether going down was honorable or not? Was it a measure to cultivate and train cadres? Or was it a measure to "dump burdens"? Based on these, the Party group held several enlarged meetings to repeatedly explain the central government's policy spirit on this work, emphasizing that cadre sending-down work should be understood from the perspective of "unified arrangement and comprehensive training," and this work should not be isolated. At the same time, it was explained that sending a group of cadres down will further force us to streamline our institutions, and overcome the three bad styles, and improve our work; and it was emphasized that we must follow the mass line, mobilize all cadres to discuss, based on the principle of strengthening work on the one hand and cultivating and training cadres on the other, whether people can still be drawn out? How many can be drawn? Who is suitable to stay in the first batch? Who is suitable to go? The Party group meeting also determined that the procedure for proposing and deciding on the list of sent-down cadres was: one, self-registration, two, public discussion by the masses, three, preliminary determination by each bureau, and four, approval by the Party group. After these work, the list of sent-down cadres increased from one hundred to two hundred, three hundred, and finally determined to be four hundred and fifty-two people. The quality of sent-down cadres also gradually increased from the initial practice of sending the weaker while keeping the stronger to adding leading cadres at all levels and stronger cadres, approaching the policy requirements of "unified arrangement and comprehensive training." Among the four hundred and fifty-two cadres finally determined to be sent down, two hundred and sixty-eight were Communist Party members, one hundred and fifty-six were Communist Youth League members, and twenty-eight were non-Party members; seventeen were bureau-level and department-level cadres, forty-eight were section-level and equivalent section-level cadres, and three hundred and eighty-seven were cadres below the eighteenth grade; three hundred and twenty-seven were male comrades and one hundred and twenty-five were female comrades; the quality was very good. The sending down of these cadres was finally decided after several rounds of mass discussion and preliminary determination by each bureau. The entire list was changed three times. For example, although some comrades firmly requested to go down for labor, they were finally persuaded to stay because of work needs. Some were left behind temporarily because of illness or family difficulties, and other comrades were transferred to go instead. After such meticulous ideological work and in-depth discussion, not only did the comrades who were sent down and those who stayed feel happy and secure in their decisions, but also the superiors and subordinates and each other had a further understanding, and they also had a further understanding of the workload. Thus, with the progress of the work, the comrades who stayed actively talked to the sent-down comrades about plans to do the work of two or three people, and the comrades who went down for labor were also in a happy mood and full of enthusiasm. Some bureaus and departments even established competition conditions with each other between those who stayed and those who were sent down.

"Encampment" Personnel Report on Rural Conditions, Sent-Down Cadres Determined to Go to the Countryside

In terms of ideological education, it is always necessary to emphasize that sent-down cadres should integrate with the peasants and endure hardships in training; in terms of organizational work, it is necessary to communicate with the local party committees in the sent-down areas as soon as possible, and assist the local party organizations in doing a good job of organizing and arranging production and labor for the sent-down cadres in the spirit of being responsible to the end. This is the third key to doing this work well. This group of sent-down cadres from the Ministry of Public Security went to the rural areas of Hejian and Nanpi counties in Hebei Province. In terms of ideological education for sent-down cadres, it has always been emphasized that we should look more at the advantages of grassroots cadres and peasants. Respect grassroots cadres, integrate with the peasants. Learn from the excellent qualities of grassroots cadres in being loyal to the Party's cause, connecting with reality, and connecting with the masses. Learn from the peasants the qualities of resolutely accepting proletarian leadership, resolutely supporting socialism, and being diligent and simple. Of course, the peasants' remaining freedom, looseness, individualism and other negative aspects cannot be learned, nor should they be pointed out and criticized. Rather, we should gradually help them overcome them after establishing a deep relationship with the peasants. After the specific locations for sending down were selected, the Party group immediately organized more than 20 department-level cadres from each bureau to go to "set up camp" ten days in advance. These "encampment" personnel will not be sent down. They will come back after arranging the sent-down comrades properly. Their "encampment" tasks are two: one is to understand the local situation and write letters to report at any time, so that the education of sent-down cadres can be closer to reality, and the other is to introduce the situation of sent-down cadres to the local party committee and assist the local party committee in doing a good job of organizing and assigning sent-down cadres, and solving some specific problems. Facts have proved that this approach is necessary and the effect is very good. For example, after the "encampment" people went to the countryside, they saw that rural irrigation, fertilizer accumulation, and water conservancy construction were in a hot and high tide of production with "red flags fluttering during the day and lights illuminating the night," and immediately wrote letters back to report. The local party and government organs attached great importance to assisting central government organs' cadres in going down for labor, and the prefectural committee, county, district, and township all convened special meetings to arrange various tasks. The cooperatives prepared mule carts to welcome the sent-down comrades, and the peasant masses also cleaned the houses where the sent-down comrades were going to live in advance, and some posted couplets to prepare for welcome. After the ministry published the "encampment" report describing these situations, it greatly encouraged the sent-down comrades. The local production conditions, social conditions, and peasants' living habits they introduced made the sent-down comrades' ideological preparations closer to reality. They learned that a few grassroots cadres were afraid that after the central cadres came down, they would have a high level of education, be able to speak well, and be difficult to lead, and some were afraid that the sent-down cadres would "replace" them and take their positions, etc. This is an important reference for the ministry to educate sent-down cadres to emphasize obedience to leadership and do more explanatory work. As for assisting the local party committee in doing a good job of organization, allocation, and other work, it is even more welcomed by the local area. Because it is difficult for the local area to properly match political and cultural levels, physical strength, and leading cadres. In addition, some specific problems have also been appropriately resolved in the spirit of the sent-down unit being responsible to the end and the local leaders leading them to labor and train. These problems can only be properly arranged in advance to be beneficial to all parties. In short, after these works, the result is that the local area is satisfied, the sending-down unit is at ease, and as soon as the sent-down cadres arrive in the countryside, they can immediately settle down and quickly join in labor production.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Public Security finally said that because the policy of "unified arrangement and comprehensive training" was adhered to in carrying out this work, and this work was regarded as an important part of rectification, the gains were multifaceted. At the beginning, when it was determined that 197 people would be sent down, some leading cadres felt that there would definitely be many difficulties, but because the ideological work was in-depth and meticulous, and the working method of the mass line was implemented, the results proved that some of the difficulties of sending cadres down were problems of ideological understanding, which were solved through discussion, and some difficulties were also solved through mutual help among the masses. For example, the comrades who stayed supported the sent-down comrades with cloth tickets, totaling more than 1,500 feet. Many comrades who stayed voluntarily took care of the sent-down comrades' family difficulties, and finally there were very few problems that needed to be solved by the leadership. Through this work, there was also a further understanding of the workload of the organs, and at the same time, the relationship between superiors and subordinates and each other was closer. More importantly, there was a political and ideological harvest. Through this work, the cadres' political awareness and policy level were improved by one step. For example, the bureaus and departments no longer regard the sent-down comrades as a "burden," but regard them as their own cadres, who will return in the future. The fact that each bureau sent the strongest heads and deputy heads of departments to "set up camp" and make arrangements for the sent-down cadres is proof of this. Although the working methods of the organs still need to be further improved, the people who remain in the organs are working very hard, conscientiously, and in high spirits. The responsible comrades of the Ministry and each bureau are also preparing to go down to visit the sent-down cadres in the New Year and Spring Festival, report to them on the rectification situation, and bring back their deeds in participating in labor to promote the work of the organs.

    机关放心　干部满意　地方欢迎
    公安部在下放干部工作中充分进行思想工作取得良好效果
    本报讯　记者连云山报道：公安部根据“统一安排，全面锻炼”的方针进行的干部下放工作已经胜利结束。公安部在进行这一工作中对全体人员反复进行思想动员；发动群众提问题，摆困难，充分讨论下放意义；从提名单，定名单到安排到农村，都始终贯彻群众路线和负责到底的精神，获得了良好的效果。现在下放干部已经愉快地到达农村劳动。全体人员通过这一工作也受了一次生动的政治教育和干部政策教育。
    最近，记者特地访问了公安部负责人，这位负责人详尽地叙述了做好下放干部工作的经验。他说：对全体干部反复阐明干部下放劳动的重要意义，并且组织充分的座谈讨论，负责干部同下放干部一一个别谈话进行细致的思想工作，是做好这项工作的首要关键。公安部早在11月间由罗瑞卿部长对全体干部报告了下放一批人去劳动锻炼的各种重要意义后，立即掀起了以大字报要求下放劳动的热潮；三天之内，报名人数达全体干部的96％。但是，根据党组当时的分析和事后干部思想暴露的情况证实：要求下放劳动的96％的人中，认识比较正确，真正下了决心的只占20％左右；处于中间状态、随大流、并未真正下了决心的人占75％左右；虽然报了名，但思想抵触，认为下放劳动是领导上“甩包袱”的占5％左右。处在中间状态的大多数人，对于下放劳动是培养和造成无产阶级干部队伍和克服国家机关三个坏主义的根本措施普遍认识不足，他们认为名是自己报了，但如果真正叫自己去，便是不被信任的人，青年知识分子干部中，不少人对下放还有种种顾虑，例如怕生活不习惯，怕吃不好饭，怕洗不到澡，怕看不上电影，怕找不到爱人，怕听不到报告等等。部分工农出身和斗争历史较久的老干部则认为自己经过劳动锻炼，所以虽然报了名，但并没有当真去劳动锻炼的思想准备。
    根据以上情况，公安部党组首先抓住反复进行政治思想动员，提高认识水平这个工作，组织全体干部听了周总理在外交部欢送下放劳动人员大会上的讲话录音，部的领导同志也结合干部的思想认识情况继续作深入的思想动员；同时组织全体干部参观了刘介梅今昔生活展览会，机关的文娱活动也配合这一工作，选映了有关建设山区、建设农村的电影。这些活动，对帮助干部正确认识下放劳动意义都起了一定的作用。
    小组座谈　个别谈话  劳动锻炼究竟为了什么？
    在这种思想动员教育的基础上，随即普遍以座谈会的形式结合自己的思想认识情况讨论下放劳动的意义，摆思想，摆困难，解决思想问题和实际困难。座谈讨论的题目，大体是这样几个：“下乡劳动锻炼是培养干部的措施，还是单纯精简的措施？”“什么样的干部需要劳动锻炼？”“下乡劳动锻炼是进步还是退步？”“下乡向农民学习些什么”？“怎样锻炼自己，下乡后应注意什么”等等。通过这种普遍的思想问题的讨论，进一步提高了群众的认识。为着更细致地做好这一工作，各处处长，各局正副局长，都找下放干部作了个别交谈，少的谈了一次，最多的交谈了三次五次。罗瑞卿部长和副部长们，分别找下放干部三三五五地集体谈了话。经过以上反复细致，普遍深入的思想工作以后，下放干部中原先思想坚决的更坚决了，原先处于中间状态的多数人，顾虑消除了，对下放的意义更明确了，积极分子的比例上升为95％以上，他们纷纷提出了保证不怕艰苦，同农民一起劳动，尊重基层干部，坚决改造自己等具体计划，形成了订立下放劳动公约的高潮。
    统一安排　全面锻炼  留者去者　皆大欢喜
    坚持“统一安排，全面锻炼”的干部工作方针，把下放干部作为整改的重要内容；从提出下放名单到最后决定名单，始终要通过群众路线的工作方法，是做好干部下放劳动的第二个重要关键。公安部开始动员干部下放时，有些局、处领导干部虽然知道下放干部劳动生产的重要意义，但具体执行起来，特别是要提出下放名单时，就有认识不足的地方；因为公安部在今年春天已经减去了一半干部，以后又调出数百人，所以很多领导同志认为可下放的人真是寥寥无几；党组第一次开会研究名单时，不少局都叫喊抽人困难，全部下放的干部要一百人都困难。有些局虽然提出了名单，但是一个强中选弱，去弱留强的名单。部分局把这名单拿到群众中去讨论时，效果很不好，群众看了名单后对下放干部的意义发生了怀疑，有的人提出下放究竟光荣不光荣？是培养锻炼干部的措施？还是“甩包袱”的措施？根据这些，党组几次扩大会议，反复讲明了中央关于这一工作的政策精神，着重说明了要从“统一安排，全面锻炼”去认识干部下放工作，不能把这一工作孤立起来。同时说明下放一批干部将进一步逼迫我们紧缩机构，和克服三个坏主义，改进工作；并且强调要走群众路线，发动全体干部根据一面要加强工作，一面要培养锻炼干部的原则，讨论是否还能抽出人？能抽多少？第一批谁留合适？谁去合适？党组会议还确定了提出和决定下放名单的程序是：一，自己报名，二，群众公议，三，各局初定，四，党组审定。经过这些工作以后，下放干部的名单从一百增加到二百、三百，最后定为四百五十二人。下放干部的质量也从一开始去弱留强的做法逐渐增加了各级领导骨干和较强的干部，接近了“统一安排，全面锻炼”的政策要求，最后确定下放的四百五十二名干部中，共产党员二百六十八人，共青团员一百五十六人，非党团员二十八人；局、处长级干部十七人，科长级和相当科长级干部四十八人，十八级以下干部三百八十七人；男同志三百二十七名，女同志一百二十五名；质量很好。这些干部的下放，是几经群众讨论，各局初定的程序才最后决定的。全部名单变更了三次，例如有的同志虽坚决要求下放劳动，但最后考虑到工作需要因而劝说他留下了。有的因身有病或家庭困难，也留下暂不下放，另外调换别的同志去。经过这样细致的思想工作和深入讨论，不仅使下放的和留下的同志都心情舒畅，去留确当。而且使上下级和互相之间都有了进一步的了解，对工作量也都进一步心中有底了。于是，随着工作的进展，留下的同志纷纷向下放同志谈一人做两三个人工作的计划，下放劳动的同志也是心情愉快，情绪饱满的，有些局、处的留下和下放同志还互相订立了竞赛条件。
    “设营”人员报告农村情况  下放干部决心走向农村
    在思想教育工作方面始终要强调下放干部同农民打成一片，吃苦锻炼；在组织工作方面及早同下放地区党委互通情况，以负责到底的精神，协助当地党组织做好下放的编组和生产劳动等安排工作，是做好这一工作的第三个关键。公安部这批下放干部是到河北省河间、南皮两县的农村去的。在对下放干部的思想教育工作方面，始终强调了对基层干部和农民要多看优点。尊重基层干部、同农民打成一片。学习基层干部忠于党的事业，联系实际，联系群众等优良品质。学习农民坚决接受无产阶级领导，坚决拥护社会主义，勤劳朴实等品质。当然，农民残存的自由散漫、个人主义等消极方面不可学习，也不必指手划足去指责。而要同农民建立深厚感情后，再逐渐帮助他们克服。在具体地选定了下放地点后，党组随即组织了各局二十余名处级干部提前十多天前往“设营”，这些“设营”人员是不下放的，他们把下放同志安排妥当后就回来。他们“设营”的任务有二，一是了解当地情况随时写信报告，以便使对下放干部的教育更加接近实际，二是向当地党委介绍下放干部的情况，协助当地党委做好下放干部的编组，分配等工作，解决一些具体问题。事实证明这个做法是需要的，效果很好。例如“设营”人到农村后，看到农村浇麦、积肥、兴修水利是“白天红旗招展、黑夜灯火通明”的热火朝天生产高潮，随即写信回来报告，当地党政机关对协助中央机关干部下放劳动更是十分重视，地委、县、区、乡都召集了专门会议布置各项工作，合作社准备了骡马大车迎接下放同志，农民群众还把下放同志要住的房子事先打扫干净，有些贴了对联准备欢迎；部里把叙述这些情况的“设营”报告公布后，对下放同志鼓舞很大。他们介绍的当地生产状况、社会情况和农民生活习惯，使下放同志的思想准备更加接近实际。他们了解到的有少数基层干部怕中央干部下来后，文化高、能说会讲、不好领导，还有的怕下放干部“代替”了自己，顶了位子等顾虑，这对部里教育下放干部强调要服从领导，并多做解释工作等，有重要的参考作用。至于协助当地党委做好编组、分配等工作，更受当地欢迎。因为像把政治、文化水平高低不同，身体强弱，领导骨干等搭配得适当，地方是很难办的。此外还有一些具体问题，也本着下放单位负责到底和地方领导他们劳动锻炼的精神，作了适当解决。这些问题也只有事先安排好才各方面有利。总之，经过这些工作，结果是地方满意，下放单位放心，下放干部一到农村，马上就能安心下来，迅速投入劳动生产。
    公安部的负责人最后说，由于在进行这一工作时坚持了“统一安排，全面锻炼”的方针，并且把这一工作作为整改的重要部分，所以得到的收获是多方面的。开始时确定下放一百九十七人时，有些领导干部觉得一定会有很多困难，但因思想工作深入细致，并且贯彻了群众路线的工作方法，结果证明下放干部的困难一部分是思想认识问题，经过讨论解决了，一部分困难经群众互相帮助也解决了，例如留下同志支援下放同志的布票，总共达一千五百多尺。很多留下的同志自愿关照下放同志的家庭困难，最后要领导解决的问题很少。通过这一工作还对机关的工作量有了进一步的摸底，同时密切了上下级和互相间的关系。更重要的还是政治思想收获，通过这一项工作，把干部的政治觉悟和政策水平提高了一步。例如各局、处对下放同志已经不认为是“包袱”，而是看作他们自己的干部，将来还要回来。从各局派“设营”人员都是派最强的正副处长，为下放干部作安排一点，就是证明。现在机关工作方法虽然还需进一步改进，但留在机关的人工作都十分紧张，兢兢业业，情绪很高。部和各局的负责同志，还准备在新年和春节时都下去看望下放干部，向他们报告整改情况，同时带回他们参加劳动的事迹，推动机关工作。
