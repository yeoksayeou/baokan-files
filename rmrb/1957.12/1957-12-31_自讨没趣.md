A Western journalist covering the Asian-African Solidarity Conference in Cairo actually asked Dr. Singh, the head of the Indian delegation, this strange question: "Why do the delegates focus on attacking Western imperialism instead of focusing on attacking the Soviet Union?"

Dr. Singh replied: The domination of Asia and Africa "comes from the West," and the interference in Asia and Africa also "comes from the West," so "the West is being attacked."

This answer is very simple, but it is enough. If that Western journalist is really ignorant, then he has finally learned a bit of common sense that is generally understood in the world today; if he is pretending to be confused and has ulterior motives, then he is just asking for trouble!

    自讨没趣
    正在开罗采访亚非团结大会的西方记者居然向印度代表团团长辛格博士发出了这样一个奇怪的问题：代表们“为什么集中地攻击西方帝国主义，而不是集中地攻击苏联？”
    辛格博士回答说：对亚非的统治“来自西方”，对亚非的干涉也“来自西方”，所以“西方遭到攻击”。
    这个回答很简单，但已足够了。那位西方记者如果真的是无知，那么他总算学到了一点现在世界上一般人都懂得的常识；如果他是假装糊涂，别有用心，那么他就是自讨没趣了！
