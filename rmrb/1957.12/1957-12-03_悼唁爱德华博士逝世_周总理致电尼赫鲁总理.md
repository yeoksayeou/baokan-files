Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd. Premier Zhou Enlai sent a telegram to Indian Prime Minister Nehru on December 1st, expressing condolences on the death of Dr. Kotnis, former leader of the Indian Medical Mission to China during the Anti-Japanese War and Vice-Chairman of the All-India Peace Council. The telegram reads as follows:
To His Excellency Prime Minister Nehru of the Government of the Republic of India:
    I am writing to you with a very heavy heart to inform you that Dr. Kotnis, a good friend of the Chinese people, unfortunately passed away at 10:25 this morning at Peking Union Medical College Hospital due to cirrhosis of the liver. After consulting with Ambassador Nehru, we cremated Dr. Kotnis before sunset today, according to the customs of the Indian people.
    During the most difficult days of the Chinese people, Dr. Kotnis led the Indian Medical Mission to China to selflessly serve the vast number of soldiers and civilians in the anti-Japanese base areas. This time, despite his old age and physical weakness, Dr. Kotnis accepted the invitation of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association to visit New China, and finally spent the last period of his life in China. From Dr. Kotnis, we saw the friendship and love of the Indian people for the Chinese people. The Chinese people will always commemorate Dr. Kotnis with respect and will continue to work hard to strengthen the great friendship between our two peoples.
    Please convey to the family of Dr. Kotnis the sincere condolences and deep mourning of the Chinese people and myself.　Zhou Enlai

    我以非常沉痛的心情通知阁下，中国人民的好朋友爱德华博士由于肝硬变症今天上午十时二十五分在北京协和医院不幸逝世。我们征求了尼赫鲁大使的意见以后，按照印度人民的习惯，在今天日落以前为爱德华博士举行了火葬。
    在中国人民最艰苦的日子里，爱德华博士曾经率领印度援华医疗队在中国抗日根据地忘我地为广大军民服务。这次，爱德华博士又不顾年老体衰，应中印友协的邀请前来新中国访问，终于在中国度过了他一生中最后的一段时光。从爱德华博士的身上，我们看到了印度人民对中国人民的友好和热爱。中国人民将永远以崇敬的心情纪念着爱德华博士，并且会继续努力来加强我们两国人民之间的伟大友谊。
    请阁下向爱德华博士的家属转致中国人民和我本人的亲切慰问和沉痛悼唁。　周恩来
