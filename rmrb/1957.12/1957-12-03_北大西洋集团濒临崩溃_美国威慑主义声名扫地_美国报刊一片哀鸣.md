Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd Dispatch from Washington: According to TASS, Washington, December 1st: Some important American newspapers are expressing panic and fear about the possible failure of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Paris conference. They call this organization a "sick alliance" and express concern about whether the United States can "revitalize" it.

    "Newsweek," in an article titled "The West - A Crisis of Confidence," emphasizes that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization "has rarely been so close to collapse as it is now." The magazine says that on the eve of the "decisive" Paris conference, internal "friction" can be seen within NATO. The Pentagon wants to deploy atomic rockets in European countries. However, "Continental Europe is in no hurry to accept American weapons." Denmark and Norway have already hinted that they do not want "offensive" rockets.

    The article says that Europeans are beginning to doubt that the Soviet Union might win if war breaks out tomorrow. Soviet rockets have already discredited the American deterrence doctrine.

    As for political issues, the magazine believes that Europe is in a state of "chaos and collapse."

    A commentary from the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain says: There are only two weeks left before the opening of the NATO conference. However, the fact is that preliminary negotiations have failed to resolve the issues critical to the success or failure of the conference. The question of the extent of consultation between NATO member states and their allies on major political steps has also not been resolved.

　　北大西洋集团濒临崩溃
　　美国威慑主义声名扫地
　　美国报刊一片哀鸣
    据新华社2日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿1日讯：美国一些重要报刊对北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议可能失败表示惊慌和恐惧。它们把这个组织称为“患病的联盟”，并且对美国是否能给这个联盟“赋以生气”表示忧虑。
    “新闻周刊”在一篇题为“西方——信任的危机”的文章中着重指出，北大西洋公约组织“很少像现在这样濒临崩溃的境地”。杂志说，在“决定性”的巴黎会议的前夕，在北大西洋公约组织中可以看到内部“磨擦”。五角大楼要在欧洲各国部署原子火箭。可是，“欧洲大陆不急于接受美国的武器。”丹麦、挪威已经暗示，它们不想要“进攻”火箭。
    文章说，欧洲人开始怀疑，如果明天爆发战争，那么苏联可能打胜。苏联的火箭已经使美国的威慑主义声名扫地。
    至于政治问题，杂志认为，欧洲正处在“混乱和崩溃的状态中”。
    斯克利浦斯—霍华德系报纸的评论说：现在离北大西洋公约组织会议开幕时间只剩两个星期了。然而事实是，初步谈判没有能够解决会议成败攸关的问题。至于北大西洋公约组织成员国和自己的同盟国在主要政治步骤方面的协商的程度问题，也没有解决。
