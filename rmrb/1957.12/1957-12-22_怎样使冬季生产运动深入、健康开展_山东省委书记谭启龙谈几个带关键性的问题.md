Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 20th December. How can the winter agricultural production and construction campaign, which has already been launched vigorously, be sustained, deepened, and healthily maintained? The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a telephone conference on the evening of the 18th, attended by responsible cadres from various district committees, municipal committees, and relevant provincial departments. Tan Qilong, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, gave instructions on this matter.

Tan Qilong said that the high tide of winter production in Shandong Province has begun to take shape. Currently, approximately 15 million laborers are engaged in the production campaign daily. The task of expanding irrigation area by 10 million mu this winter and next spring was already 4.4 million mu complete by December 6th. Although there are still a few areas that have not taken action or are slow to act, generally speaking, the development of the campaign is healthy. However, based on reports from various regions and inspections by the work teams dispatched by the Provincial Party Committee, several issues deserve early attention: First, high attendance rate but low production efficiency. The attendance rate of many cooperatives has reached over 90%, and this enthusiasm is naturally good. However, some cooperatives are not organizing production well, and the work is chaotic. In some cases, thousands of people are working on one construction site, affecting the improvement of efficiency. Second, there is a tendency to only think about doing big things and not being willing to do small things. Instead of starting from small to large and from easy to difficult, they reach out to ask for money, technical cadres, and various materials from higher levels. The policy of relying on the masses to build water conservancy projects has not been well implemented. Third, insufficient attention is paid to the development of diversified economy in the arrangement and use of labor. For example, some cooperatives do not allow members to engage in sideline occupations, and some members have already reflected that they have no money to spend, no firewood to burn, and are experiencing difficulties in life. Some cooperatives have launched red flag competitions with great enthusiasm, but there is a phenomenon of competing in physical strength. After working all day, they continue to work at night. Members have reflected that they cannot bear it. Therefore, some people are looking forward to heavy snow and freezing, so they can take a rest. Fourth, cadres and the masses do not have a clear enough understanding of the idea of long-term arduous struggle, and have not understood the true meaning of the Provincial Party Committee's proposal to endure ten years of hardship for the benefit of the people of Shandong. As a result, they become complacent and satisfied after achieving some initial results, and want to relax after the "assault month" has passed. Fifth, the issue of mutual integration of production, rectification of cooperatives, and other tasks has not been resolved in some areas, and there is a phenomenon of attending to one thing and losing sight of another.

Tan Qilong said that in order to solve the above five problems, the leadership must grasp the following key issues: First, while focusing on farmland capital construction with water, fertilizer, and soil as the key points, we must also comprehensively arrange various production activities. He believes that the Shou Zhang County's practice of organizing five armies for water conservancy, soil improvement, fertilizer accumulation, wheat field management, and sideline occupations, with the leadership dividing responsibilities is good. The labor time of members inside and outside the cooperative should also be appropriately arranged. Members should be given time to take care of household affairs and have adequate rest time. Otherwise, it will be difficult for the campaign to continue for a long time. Second, we must further improve the systematic and specific production planning. Planning by the cooperatives is very important, but from the current situation, the planning of one township or one cooperative is not enough. We must implement unified planning for several cooperatives, several townships, or even several counties based on different regions, such as a mountainous area, a river, a plain, a waterlogged area, or a sandy saline area. Under unified leadership and unified organization, special personnel should be responsible for coordinating and carrying out the work. He believes that the experience of Licheng County in dividing the entire county into four major areas: mountainous, plain, hilly, and sandy saline, and establishing command posts respectively, with secretaries in charge, is good. He requested that all regions carefully plan, draw maps, and proceed from rough to detailed, and from simple to complex. With a clear direction, we can reduce blindness. Third, leaders at all levels, especially the leaders of the district and county committees, should guide the current campaign with great clarity and prudence. They must promptly grasp the overall situation, pay attention to going deep into the production front line, analyze and study the trends of the campaign, and promptly solve problems when they are discovered in their infancy. In terms of leadership methods, attention should be paid to grasping both ends. Fourth, production must be combined with other tasks. Promoting production through socialist debate has been done by all regions in general, but some places have not paid enough attention to the year-end distribution and unified purchase and supply arrangements. It is understood that only about one-quarter of the cooperatives in the province have completed or basically completed the year-end distribution. This situation must be changed quickly by arranging manpower. The production and disaster relief work in disaster areas must also be further strengthened under leadership. It must be clearly recognized that if these tasks are not done well, they will have a great impact on the deep, balanced, and lasting development of the campaign.

    怎样使冬季生产运动深入、健康开展
    山东省委书记谭启龙谈几个带关键性的问题
    据新华社济南20日电  如何使已经轰轰烈烈开展起来的冬季农业生产建设运动持久、深入、健康地坚持下去？中共山东省委18日晚上召开了各地委、市委和省级有关部门负责干部参加的电话会议，省委书记处书记谭启龙对此作了指示。
    谭启龙说，山东全省的冬季生产高潮已经开始形成，目前每天约有一千五百万劳动大军投入生产运动，今冬明春扩大灌溉面积一千万亩的任务，到12月6日就已经完成四百四十万亩。虽然还有少数地区没有行动起来或行动迟缓，总的说，运动的发展是健康的。但是从各地汇报和省委派出工作组检查的情况看，有几个问题值得及早注意：一、出勤率高，生产效率低。很多合作社出勤率达到90％以上，这种劲头自然是好的。但有些社生产组织得不好，干活时乱轰轰，有的数千人在一个工地干活，影响到效率的提高。二、光想搞大的，不愿搞小的。不是由小到大，先易后难，而是伸手向上要钱，要技术干部，要各种物资。没有很好贯彻依靠群众兴修水利的方针。三、安排使用劳力上，对发展多种经济注意不够。如有的社不准社员搞副业，有些社员已经反映没钱花，没柴烧，生活困难。有一部分社开展了红旗竞赛，劲头很大，但有拼体力的现象，白天干一天，夜里又接着干。社员反映受不了。因此，有些人盼着下大雪、封冻，好歇一歇。四、干部、群众对长期的艰苦奋斗的思想还不够明确，没有领会省委提出的忍受十年艰苦，为山东人民造福的真实意义，以致取得一些初步成绩，就麻痹自满起来，“突击月”过去了，就想松劲。五、生产、整社以及其他工作的互相结合问题，有些地区还没有解决，有顾此失彼的现象。
    谭启龙说，为了解决上述五个方面的问题，领导上必须抓住下列几个带关键性的问题：第一、既要突出地抓住以水、肥、土为重点的农田基本建设，同时又要全面安排各项生产。他认为寿张县组织水利、改良土壤、积肥、麦田管理、副业等五路大军，由领导分工掌握的做法是好的。对于社员在社内和社外的劳动时间，也应当适当安排。要给社员料理家务的时间，也要有适当休息时间。否则，运动持久下去是有困难的。第二、要进一步搞好系统的具体的生产规划。社有规划很重要，但从目前情况看来，一乡一社的规划已经不够了。必须根据不同地区，如一个山区、一条河流、一块平原、一片涝洼、一片沙碱，实行几个社，几个乡，以至几个县的统一规划；在统一领导、统一组织之下，专人负责，协同进行。他认为，历城县把全城分成山区、平原、丘陵、沙碱四大片，分别成立指挥部，由书记分工挂帅的经验是好的。他要求各地认真规划，把地图画出来，做到由粗到细，由简到繁；方向明确了，就可以减少盲目性。第三、各级领导，特别是地委、县委领导应当十分清醒、十分慎重地指导当前运动。要及时掌握全面情况，注意深入生产前线，分析研究运动的趋向，在发现问题的萌芽时，就及时加以解决。在领导方法上，要注意抓两头。第四、生产要和其他工作结合。通过社会主义大辩论推动生产，各地一般都这样做了，但是对全年决分、统销安排工作有些地方还注意不够。据了解：全省决分已经结束或基本结束的社仅占四分之一左右，这种情况，必须迅速安排力量予以改变。灾区的生产救灾工作也必须进一步加强领导。要明确认识，这些工作做不好，对运动深入、平衡和持久的发展，是会有很大影响的。
