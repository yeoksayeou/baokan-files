Don't Be Attached to Large Setups

    "Streamlining institutions and reducing personnel" has become the central topic of discussion in various government departments during this round of "Great Blooming and Contending." Many people have also proposed streamlining plans with revolutionary spirit, willing to take on the work of two or even three people. More people have expressed their determination to be transferred to lower levels and requested to be tempered through labor. Leaders of many departments have also made the greatest determination to streamline institutions, improve working methods, and change the past situation of bloated organizations and overstaffing through this rectification movement. However, a few leading departments and leading comrades are still reluctant to part with the situation of "large setups and more people make things easier," and are unwilling to make a firm decision to streamline; some even emphasized that "reducing personnel requires reducing work tasks." The General Office of the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee has such a point of view.

    This argument shows that these comrades have a problematic understanding of the significance of "streamlining institutions and reducing personnel." The so-called "streamlining institutions and reducing personnel" is to cut and merge those dispensable institutions and reduce the number of staff who have not fully played their role in the work of the organs. It means genuinely improving working methods and increasing work efficiency so that fewer people can undertake the original work, and the other people can play a role in other positions. Doing so definitely does not mean ignoring what should be managed or failing to complete the tasks that should be completed. Of course, it is difficult to reduce people without reducing tasks, but difficulties can be overcome, and the key lies in whether there is a revolutionary spirit.

    不要留恋大摊子
    “紧缩机构、减少人员”，这个问题，在这次大鸣大放中，已成为各机关舆论的中心，而且，不少群众也以革命精神提出了紧缩方案，愿意一个人担负起两个人甚至三个人的工作。更多的群众表示了自己下放的决心，要求到劳动中去锻炼。不少机关的领导人也下了最大的决心，通过这次整风运动紧缩机构、改进工作方法，改变过去那种机构臃肿、人浮于事的现象。但是，有少数的领导机关、领导同志仍然恋恋于“摊子大、人多好办事”的局面，不肯下决心精简；有的甚至强调“要减少人员就得减少工作任务”，辽宁省人民委员会办公厅就有这种论调。
    这种论调，说明这些同志对“紧缩机构、减少人员”的意义理解得有问题。所谓“紧缩机构、减少人员”，就是要裁减合并那些可有可无的机构，减少在机关工作中没有完全发挥作用的工作人员。真正的改进工作方法，提高工作效率，以较少的人力担负原有的工作，另外的人则可以在别的岗位上发挥作用。这样做，决不是该管的事也不管，该完成的任务也不完成。当然，减少了人不减少任务是有困难的，但，困难是可以克服的，关键就在于有没有革命精神。
