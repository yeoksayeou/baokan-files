Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 11th, TASS dispatch: The Soviet Union's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the United States, Zarubin, visited U.S. Deputy Undersecretary of State Robert Murphy on December 10th and requested him to forward a letter from the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, to U.S. President Eisenhower.

The full text of the letter is as follows: Dear Mr. President,

I am writing this letter to you to exchange some views on the current international situation. Recently, the Soviet government comprehensively studied the issue of the international situation. In this regard, we cannot but seriously note that, at the instigation of the United States and the United Kingdom, some measures are being drafted aimed at greatly intensifying the military preparations of the member states of the North Atlantic Alliance (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), and some of the plans in this regard are linked to the upcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council.

It is now very clear that the essence of these measures is nothing more than to mobilize all the resources of the North Atlantic Alliance participating countries to strengthen armaments and prepare for war in an all-round way.

The leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization openly say that the upcoming meeting will discuss military strategic plans that stipulate the large-scale use of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

It is worth noting that all these activities are being carried out in an atmosphere of artificially created nervousness and fear about the so-called "threat" from the Soviet side, and in order to create this atmosphere, the latest scientific and technological achievements of the Soviet Union are being widely used as an excuse.

In our opinion, the serious danger is that, as a result of such actions, the international situation will not develop in the direction required by the interests of consolidating peace.

On the other hand, in all countries of the world, the massive movement to stop the expansion of armaments and to prevent the threat of a new war is constantly developing and expanding. The people of all countries demand the implementation of such a policy: that countries should not sharpen their swords against each other, but should live in peace, respect each other's rights and interests, and benefit from mutual cooperation.

All this convinces us that an important juncture has been reached in the development of the international situation.

We believe that, in this situation, the responsibility of governments in determining future foreign policy is unprecedentedly great. The responsibility of the governments of major countries is particularly great.

I should tell you frankly, Mr. President, that the reaction of some people in your country and other countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to the Soviet Union's recent achievements in science and technology, especially the launching of artificial earth satellites by the Soviet Union in accordance with the International Geophysical Year program, seems to us to be very wrong.

Naturally, the launching of artificial earth satellites proves that the Soviet Union has made great achievements in peaceful scientific research and in military technology. But everyone knows very well that the Soviet Union has always firmly advocated that ballistic missiles, hydrogen bombs, and atomic bombs should never be used as instruments of slaughter, but that the great achievements of human wisdom, such as the discovery of atomic energy, should be used for the peaceful development of society. The Soviet Union is neither preparing to attack the United States nor any other country. It calls for consultation and peaceful coexistence. Many countries, including the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries, stand on this position.

However, in the current situation, Western countries' governments have decided to further intensify the expansion of armaments and strive to sharpen the "Cold War." We are deeply convinced that nothing is more dangerous to world peace than this.

First of all, if the race to produce newer and newer weapons continues now, and its scale expands more and more, who can guarantee that the members of the North Atlantic Alliance will definitely prevail in this race? As for the expansion of armaments itself, it not only places an increasingly heavy burden on the shoulders of the people of all countries, but also increasingly expands the danger of the outbreak of war, and I do not need to say more about this.

Let us assume that the American military, when emphasizing the manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction, hopes to achieve certain achievements when calling for further expansion of war preparations. But nothing can change the fact that the current level of military technology has created a situation for the first time in history where no major country's territory can enjoy the superior position of avoiding becoming a battlefield from the very beginning of a conflict. Although the United States has a widely distributed network of military bases, and it also intends to use the territory and military potential of Western European countries, this does not change the situation in this regard in the slightest.

The United States has now announced the argument of "mutual dependence" among the participants of the North Atlantic Alliance. Some people expect these countries to make new and greater contributions to the alliance's war preparations. Considerable pressure has been exerted on them in an attempt to make them agree to set up nuclear weapons and rocket weapons on their territories.

Western military personnel apparently, in order to reduce the completely understandable anxiety caused by the prospect of setting up nuclear weapons in their own countries, are trying to portray so-called "tactical" atomic weapons as being not much different from ordinary weapons, and that the use of such weapons will not cause such devastating consequences as the use of atomic and hydrogen bombs. It cannot be overlooked that this statement, which aims to confuse the public, has malicious intentions and is an attempt to justify preparations for launching an atomic war.

What will be the result of all this?

We believe that the military position of the United States itself will not be improved in the slightest, nor will the United States become less vulnerable to attack, and the danger of war will be further expanded.

It is doubtful whether this policy can strengthen the relationship between the United States and its European allies. It seems to be quite the opposite, because, in the final analysis, no country will be willing to sacrifice its own independence for strategic plans that are not in line with its own interests, nor will it be willing to expose itself to the danger of being attacked by establishing foreign military bases within its own territory.

As for the U.S. plan to supply European allies with nuclear weapons, such measures can only further sharpen the already very complex European situation and cause European countries to start an atomic arms race.

It is also impossible not to consider that, for example, supplying the Federal Republic of Germany with nuclear weapons may activate such forces in Europe and cause some unfortunate consequences that even members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization may not have anticipated.

One of the arguments used by Western military circles to justify demands for expanding armaments is the so-called "local war" theory. It must be pointed out very resolutely that this "theory" is not only fundamentally untenable from a military point of view, but is also very dangerous from a political point of view.

Everyone knows that world wars in the past also started from "local" wars. In this era, when there are mutually opposed military blocs in the world (each of which has dozens of countries in different regions of the world), and the range of modern weapons is not limited by geography, can it really be believed that war can be "localized"?

It is also worth noting that there are reports that plans are being made to merge the military blocs established by Western countries in various regions of the world, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Baghdad Pact, in some form. Mr. President, I cannot but tell you that we believe that the emergence of these plans is a tendency that directly violates the idea of jointly strengthening international peace and security, which was the idea under which the United Nations was established with the active participation of our two countries. In fact, if the existence of the above-mentioned military blocs has already had a harmful impact on the entire international situation, then it is very obvious that attempting to unite countries on several continents on the basis of a program of jointly planning new wars would mean undermining the United Nations and would bring irreparable damage to the United Nations.

Of course, we all know that plans to further intensify war preparations are said to be plans aimed at ensuring the security of Western countries and strengthening peace. However, the leaders of countries such as the United States and the Soviet Union bear such a great responsibility that when evaluating this or that diplomatic policy, they cannot but adopt an unbiased, objective attitude that takes into account the actual state of affairs and historical experience. Has not the entire experience of the development of international relations in the last ten years already shown that the view that peace and the security of the people can be guaranteed through the path of strengthening armaments and the "Cold War," through the path of the "brink of war" policy, is unfounded?

The recent decade has been spent under the banner of certain groups in the West declaring a policy of "positions of strength" and "Cold War."

During all these years, the consciousness of the people of the West has been poisoned by the rampant propaganda of the idea that war is inevitable and that war preparations must be intensified. This war propaganda has largely caused the sharpening of the international situation and undermined trust between countries. It is one of the main links in the "positions of strength" policy.

Today, the whole world sees that this policy has not brought any positive results, even for those countries that have stubbornly implemented this policy for a long time. This policy has put humanity on the verge of a new war, the consequences of which are difficult to imagine.

It is by no means accidental that the world is increasingly calling for an end to war propaganda, an end to the "Cold War," an end to the endless arms race, and a move towards the path of peaceful coexistence among countries. The idea of peaceful coexistence is increasingly becoming an absolute requirement of the historical juncture in which we now find ourselves.

As everyone knows, the most ardent advocates of the "Cold War" are trying to portray this demand as "Communist propaganda." Of course, we Communists do not deny that we wholeheartedly adhere to the program of peaceful coexistence, the program of international peace, and friendly cooperation, and we are proud of this. But is this just our program? Are all those national leaders and social activists in India, Indonesia, Britain, France, and other countries who resolutely and enthusiastically call for abandoning the "policy of strength" and calling for peaceful coexistence Communists? Do their calls not reflect the feelings and will of millions upon millions of people?

We feel that the current international situation is such that the answer to a major question that deeply disturbs all mankind depends to a large extent on the actions that countries, especially major countries, will take in the near future. This major question is: Should we continue and increasingly accelerate towards the direction of war disaster? Or should the decision-makers of countries' policies embark on the only rational path of peaceful coexistence and cooperation among countries?

For this, it is only necessary to take a sober look at the current situation, to recognize in fact that every country has the right to choose its own form of government and economic system, to abandon attempts to solve international problems by force, to never use war as a means of resolving international disputes, and to establish relations between countries on the basis of equality, respect, independence, non-interference in internal affairs, and mutual benefit.

We believe that, from the perspective of safeguarding world peace, it is necessary to fully and unequivocally recognize the situation that capitalist and socialist countries exist in the world today. We all cannot but consider that any attempt to forcibly change this situation and disrupt the "status quo," any attempt to forcibly carry out territorial changes, will cause unfortunate consequences.

Mr. President, I am well aware that in many of your speeches you have more than once believed that lasting peace cannot be established on the basis of an arms race, and you hope to live in peace and cooperate with other countries, including the Soviet Union. You explained this when you spoke with Khrushchev and me during the Geneva Four-Power Summit in the summer of 1955. But it is regrettable that, in reality, all the steps taken by the Soviet government to improve relations with the United States have not been positively responded to by the U.S. government to this day.

At the same time, we believe that the current state of Soviet-American relations is unsatisfactory to both the Soviet people and the American people. Such relations often have a tense or even almost hostile nature, and this situation is unjustifiable from a political, economic, or moral point of view. It is absurd that two great powers have all the necessary conditions to develop their economies, have successfully cooperated many times in the past, and we believe that they have no irreconcilable conflicts of interest even now, yet their relationship has consistently failed to normalize.

This issue is of particularly great significance because, under the present conditions, the fate of world peace depends to a large extent, perhaps even decisively, on the state of relations between our two countries. It is precisely for this reason that our two countries are particularly in need of taking the initiative and doing what the people of all countries have long expected - breaking the deadlock of the "Cold War."

The necessary prerequisites for this are available. I have no doubt that the American people, like the Soviet people, do not want a new war to break out. Our two countries once closely cooperated and won victory in the struggle against Hitler's aggression. And now, when the prevention of a new world-wide catastrophe depends to such a great extent on our two countries, can we not summon the courage to face the facts, can we not unite and work together for peace? We recognize the seriousness of the current situation and deeply hope to maintain peace, therefore, we appeal to you, Mr. President, hoping that we will work together to end the "Cold War," stop the arms race, and resolutely embark on the road of peaceful coexistence.

Please allow me to explain what we think can be done in this regard.

We regret that disarmament negotiations have not achieved results due to the position taken by Western countries. The Soviet Union remains willing to reach an agreement on effective disarmament measures. Whether disarmament negotiations can develop in the right direction or remain in a deadlock depends on Western countries.

It must be admitted that what hinders the reaching of an agreement on the disarmament issue is that the parties participating in the negotiations do not have the necessary trust in each other. Can we think of some ways to build this trust? Of course, it is possible.

We propose: Let us, together with the British government, temporarily undertake the obligation not to use nuclear weapons, and announce the cessation of all experimental explosions of nuclear weapons from January 1, 1958, even if only for a period of two or three years to begin with.

Let us, together with the British government, reach an agreement: not to deploy any kind of nuclear weapons in Germany - whether West Germany or East Germany. If, in addition to this agreement, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic can also reach an agreement on not producing nuclear weapons and not deploying such weapons in Germany, then the governments of Poland and Czechoslovakia will, as they have already formally declared, not produce and deploy nuclear weapons in their own territories either. In this way, there will be a vast region in Central Europe with more than 100 million inhabitants without atomic armament, in which the danger of atomic war will be minimized.

Let us formulate a joint proposal and submit it to the members of the North Atlantic Alliance and the members of the Warsaw Pact for discussion. This joint proposal advocates that the two groups of countries sign a non-aggression pact in some form.

Let us agree that, in order to normalize the situation in the Middle East and Near East, we will not take any steps that would undermine the independence of the countries in this region, and that we will not use force to solve problems related to the Middle East and Near East.

Let us conclude a treaty declaring that our two countries firmly advocate the development of friendly and peaceful coexistence relations between us.

It is time to take measures to stop the current propaganda through newspapers and radio that creates mutual mistrust, suspicion, and hostility.

It is necessary to restore the conditions for the normal development of our two countries' trade ties, because mutually beneficial trade is the best basis for developing our two countries' relations and establishing trust between us.

Let us do everything possible to expand scientific, cultural, and sports ties. For example, it is conceivable what good results could be achieved if Soviet and American scientists cooperated in the cause of further conquering the forces of nature and benefiting mankind.

There is no doubt that the implementation of the above-mentioned measures, which do not harm the security and other interests of any country in the slightest, would be of great significance for improving the overall international situation and for establishing an atmosphere of trust between countries, without which it is impossible to guarantee lasting peace among the people of all countries.

After establishing the necessary trust in relations between countries, it will be possible to start implementing the following fundamental measures: drastically reducing armed forces and armaments, completely prohibiting nuclear weapons, stopping the production of nuclear weapons and destroying stockpiled nuclear weapons, withdrawing foreign armed forces from the territories of all countries (including members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact), and replacing the current military blocs with a collective security system.

This important juncture in the development of international relations that we are facing may require us to make realistic decisions that are in line with the vital interests and will of the people of all countries more urgently than ever before. Past experience has shown us how much the leaders of countries can contribute to the well-being of the people of all countries if they correctly understand the requirements of the historical moment and act in accordance with these requirements.

I know that you, Mr. President, are a person of great vision and peace-loving, and I hope that you will correctly understand this appeal, realize the responsibility that falls on the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union in the current situation, and be prepared to unite the forces of our two countries in order to achieve a lofty goal - to lead the development of the situation towards lasting peace and friendly cooperation among the people of all countries.

We believe that the direct contact of national leaders is of great significance, and that doing so can help to achieve consensus on major international issues. We on our side are also ready to agree to a direct meeting of the leaders of major countries to discuss the issues mentioned in this letter and other issues that the participants of the meeting consider necessary to discuss.

With sincere regards,
N. Bulganin

### 布尔加宁给艾森豪威尔的信

　　布尔加宁给艾森豪威尔的信
    新华社12日讯　塔斯社莫斯科11日电：苏联驻美国特命全权大使查鲁宾12月10日拜访美国副国务卿帮助墨菲，并请他把苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的信件转交给美国总统艾森豪威尔。
    信件全文如下：敬爱的总统先生，
    我给您写这封信是想就目前国际形势交换一些意见。最近，苏联政府全面研究了国际情势问题。在这方面，我们当然不能不严重地注意到，由于美国和英国的倡导，有人正在拟定一些旨在使北大西洋联盟（北大西洋公约组织）成员国大大加紧军事准备的措施，而且在这方面的某些打算是同日内即将举行的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议有联系的。
    现在已经看得很清楚，这些措施的实质不外是要动员北大西洋联盟参加国的所有资源，来加强武装，全面备战。
    北大西洋公约组织领导人公开地说，即将举行的会议将讨论一些规定大规模使用原子武器和氢武器的军事战略计划。
    值得注意的是：这一切活动是在人为制造的对苏联方面的所谓“威胁”的神经过敏和恐惧的气氛中进行的，并且为了制造这种气氛，还特别广泛地利用苏联最新的科学技术成就作为借口。
    在我们看来，严重的危险是：由于这种行动，国际局势将不是朝巩固和平的利益所要求的方向发展。
    另一方面，在世界各国，争取停止扩充军备、争取防止爆发新战争威胁的声势浩大的运动不断发展和扩大。各国人民要求执行这样的政策：各国不是磨刀相向，而是和平相处、相互尊重权利和利益，并且从彼此合作中得到益处。
    这一切使我们相信，在国际局势的发展中，已到了重要关头。
    我们认为，在这种情况下，各国政府在决定今后外交政策时所负的责任是空前重大的。各大国政府的责任尤其重大。
    应当坦率地告诉您，总统先生，贵国和北大西洋公约组织其他一些国家的某些人士对苏联最近在科学技术方面的成就、特别是对苏联根据国际地球物理年的计划发射人造地球卫星这件事的反应，在我们看来，是十分错误的。
    自然，人造地球卫星的发射证明苏联在和平的科学研究方面以及在军事技术方面都有巨大成就。但是大家都清楚地知道，苏联过去和现在都坚决主张，永远不用弹道火箭以及氢弹和原子弹作为屠杀手段，而主张把像发现原子能这样的人类智慧的伟大成就用来为社会的和平发展服务。苏联既不准备进攻美国，也不准备进攻其他任何国家。它要求协商，要求和平共处。有许多国家，其中包括中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家都站在这种立场上。
    然而，西方国家政府在当前形势下却决定更加加紧扩充军备，争取使“冷战”尖锐化的路线。我们深信，对世界和平说来，再没有什么比这更危险的了。
    首先，如果现在生产越来越新式的武器的竞赛继续下去，并且它的规模愈来愈扩大，那么谁能保险在这一竞赛中就一定是北大西洋联盟的成员国占上风呢？至于扩充军备本身不仅把愈来愈重的担子加到各国人民的肩上，而且也愈来愈扩大了爆发战争的危险性，这一点我已不必再说了。
    我们且假定说，美国的军事家们在特别着重制造新式大规模毁灭性武器的情况下号召进一步展开备战活动时指望能达到某些成就。但是什么也不能改变这一事实，即目前的军事技术水平有史以来第一次形成了这样的情况：如果一旦发生战争，没有一个大国的国土能够处于避免在冲突一开始便成为战场这样一个优越地位。虽然美国有着广泛分布的军事基地网，而且它还打算利用西欧盟国的领土和军事潜力，然而这也丝毫不能改变这方面的情况。
    现在美国宣布了北大西洋联盟参加国“互相依赖”的论点。有人期待这些国家对这个联盟的备战作出新的、更多的贡献。有人对它们施加了不小的压力，企图使它们同意在它们国土上设置核武器和火箭武器。
    西方的军事人士显然为了减少由于在他们国内设置核武器的前景所引起的、完全可以理解的忧虑，企图把所谓“战术”原子武器说成是同普通武器差不了多少，并且使用这种武器不会引起像使用原子弹和氢弹那样的毁灭性后果。不能不看到，这种旨在迷惑公众的说法，用心险恶，是企图为准备发动原子战争辩护。
    这一切会有什么结果呢？
    我们认为，美国本身的军事地位并不能因此而有丝毫好转，美国也并不会因此变得不容易受到攻击，而战争危险还会更为扩大。
    这种政策是否能使美国和它的欧洲盟国之间的关系有所加强，这是值得怀疑的。看来是恰恰相反，因为，归根到底任何一个国家都不会愿意为了同本国利益不相符的战略计划而牺牲自己的独立，也不会愿意由于在本国境内建立有外国军事基地而使自己蒙受遭到打击的危险。
    至于谈到美国供给欧洲盟国核武器的计划，那末这种措施只能使本来就已经很复杂的欧洲局势更加尖锐化，并且使欧洲各国开始原子军备竞赛。
    也不能不考虑到：比如，供给德意志联邦共和国核武器可能使这种势力在欧洲活动起来，并且造成一些可能是北大西洋公约组织成员国都意料不到的不幸后果。
    西方军界人士用来为扩充军备要求辩护的论据之一就是所谓“局部战争”论。必须十分坚决地指出，这种“理论”，不仅从军事观点来看是根本站不住脚的，就是从政治方面来看也是非常危险的。
    大家都知道，过去世界性的战争也是从“局部性的”战争开始的。现时代，当世界上存在着互相对立的军事集团（它们各自拥有世界不同地区的几十个国家），而现代化武器的射程又不受地理上的限制，能否当真认为战争可能“局部化”呢？
    据说，计划把西方国家在世界各地区建立的北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织、巴格达条约等军事集团用某种形式合并起来，这样的消息也是值得注意的。总统先生，我不能不对您讲，我们认为这些计划的出现是直接违背共同加强国际和平与安全思想的一种倾向，当初本着这种思想在我们两国积极参与下成立了联合国。事实上，如果目前上述军事集团的存在已经对整个国际局势产生了有害的影响，那么十分明显，企图在共同策划新战争的纲领的基础上把几大洲的国家联合在一起，这就意味着破坏联合国，并且会给联合国带来不可弥补的损失。
    当然我们都知道，进一步加紧备战的计划被说成是旨在保障西方国家安全和加强和平的计划。但是，像美国和苏联这样一些国家的领导人负有十分重大的责任，以致在评价这种或那种外交方针时不能不采取无偏见的、客观的、考虑实际事态和历史经验的态度。难道最近十年来国际关系发展的全部经验不是已经说明，那种认为通过加强军备和“冷战”的道路，通过“战争边缘”政策的道路来保证和平和人民安全的看法是毫无根据的么？
    最近的十年是在西方某些集团宣布“实力地位”和“冷战”政策的标志下度过的。
    在所有这些年当中，西方人民的意识受到了时刻鼓吹战争不可避免和必须加紧备战的思想的猖狂宣传的毒害。这种战争宣传在很大程度上造成了国际局势的尖锐化，破坏了各国间的信任，它是“实力地位”政策的主要环节之一。
    今天全世界都看到，这种政策没有带来任何积极的结果，就是对于那些长期顽固地执行这个政策的国家也是如此。这种政策使人类面临着恶果难以想像的新战争的危险。
    世界上要求停止战争宣传，停止“冷战”，终止毫无止境的军备竞赛和走上各国和平共处道路的呼声越来越响亮，这决不是偶然的。和平共处的思想日益成为我们现在所处的历史关头的绝对的要求。
    大家知道，“冷战”最狂热的拥护者企图把这种要求说成是“共产主义宣传”。当然，我们共产党人并不否认，我们要全心全意地坚持和平共处的纲领、国际和平、友好合作的纲领，而且我们为此感到骄傲。可是难道这只是我们的纲领么？难道所有那些坚决热烈地号召放弃“实力政策”、号召和平共处的印度、印度尼西亚、英国、法国以及其他国家的国家领导人和社会活动家都是共产党员吗？难道他们的呼声不反映千千万万人的心情和意志吗？
    我们觉得，目前国际局势是这样的：对一个使全人类深深不安的主要问题的回答在很大程度上取决于各国，首先是大国在最近时期将采取的行动。这个主要问题是：是继续并且日益加速地走向战争灾祸的方向呢？还是各国政策的决策人走上各国和平共处与合作的唯一理智的道路呢？
    为此只需要清醒地看一看当前的局势，在事实上承认每个国家有权利选择自己的政权形式和经济制度，放弃靠武力来解决国际问题的企图，永远不以战争作为解决国际争端的手段，各国在平等、尊重、独立、互不干涉内政和互利的基础上建立关系。
    我们认为，如果从保障世界和平的利益出发，那末就必需完全肯定地承认现在世界上存在着资本主义国家和社会主义国家的局面。我们大家不能不考虑到，想强行改变这种局面和破坏“现状”的任何企图，想强迫进行领土改变的任何企图都会造成不幸的后果。
    总统先生，我清楚地知道，您在多次演说中曾不止一次地认为，持久和平不可能建立在军备竞赛的基础上，您希望同别的国家，包括苏联和平相处和合作。在1955年夏天日内瓦四国政府首脑会议期间您在同赫鲁晓夫和我谈话时就说明了这一点。但是不能不遗憾地说，实际上苏联政府想改善同美国的关系的一切步骤至今没有得到美国政府的积极响应。
    同时我们认为，苏美关系的现状既不能使苏联人民感到满意，也不能使美国人民满意。这种关系往往带有紧张甚至差不多是敌对的性质，这种情况无论从政治观点、经济观点或是道义观点来说都是说不过去的。两个大国拥有一切必要条件来发展自己的经济，过去曾多次地顺利合作过，我们相信它们就是在现在也没有什么不可调和的利益矛盾，然而它们之间的关系却始终不能正常起来，这种情况实在是荒谬的。
    这个问题之所以尤其有巨大意义，是因为在现在的条件下我们两国关系如何，在很大程度上，甚至可能在决定性的程度上决定世界和平的命运。正是因为如此，我们两国就特别需要采取主动，做出各国人民早就期待的事情——打破“冷战”的僵局。
    这一方面的必要前提是具备的。我毫不怀疑，美国人民也像苏联人民一样不愿发生新的战争。我们两国曾经密切合作，在反对希特勒侵略的斗争中取得了胜利。而现在，正当防止新战争的世界性的灾难在如此巨大的程度上决定于我们两国的时候，难道我们就不能拿出勇气来面对事实，就不能联合起来共同为和平而努力吗？我们认识到当前局势的严重，深深希望维护和平，因此向您总统先生发出呼吁，希望我们共同努力，结束“冷战”，停止军备竞赛，坚决走和平共处的道路。
    请允许我说明一下，我们认为在这个方面能够做些什么事情。
    我们感到遗憾的是：由于西方国家所采取的立场，裁军谈判没有取得效果。苏联仍旧愿意就有效的裁军措施达成协议。裁军谈判是否能朝正确的方向发展，或是仍旧停留在僵局之中，这取决于西方国家。
    必须承认，妨碍裁军问题达成协议的是：参加谈判的各方彼此没有必要的信任。是否能想些办法来建立这种信任呢？自然是可能的。
    我们提议：让我们同英国政府一道暂时只承担不使用核武器的义务，并且宣布从1958年1月1日起停止各种核武器的试验性的爆炸，开始时哪怕是为期两三年也好。
    让我们同英国政府一起达成协议：不在德国境内——无论是西德或是东德——配置任何种类的核武器。如果除了这个协议外，德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国两国也能就不生产核武器和不在德国境内配置这种武器的问题达成协议，那末，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克两国政府将如它们已经正式声明的那样，也不在本国境内生产和配置核武器，这样一来，在中欧将出现一个有一亿以上居民的没有原子军备的辽阔地区，在这个地区，原子战争的危险将缩小到最小限度。
    让我们拟定一个联合建议，并提交北大西洋联盟成员国和华沙条约成员国讨论，这个联合建议就是主张用某种形式签订这两个国家集团互不侵犯的协定。
    让我们约定，为了使中近东局势正常化，不采取任何破坏这个地区的国家的独立的步骤，并且让我们不使用武力解决有关中近东的问题。
    让我们缔结一个条约，宣布我们两国坚决主张在我们之间发展友谊与和平共处的关系。
    是时候了，应该采取措施停止目前通过报刊和广播进行的、产生互不信任、怀疑、敌视情绪的宣传。
    必须恢复正常发展我们两国贸易联系的条件，因为互利的贸易是发展我们两国的关系、建立我们之间的信任的最好基础。
    让我们尽一切努力来扩大科学、文化和体育联系。举例来说，可以想像，如果苏联和美国科学家在进一步征服自然力、使之为人类造福的事业中互相合作，将会得到怎样良好的结果。
    毫无疑问，实现上列这些对任何国家的安全和其他利益无丝毫损害的措施对于改善整个国际情况、对于建立各国之间的信任气氛有着巨大意义，否则，根本就谈不到保证各国人民之间的持久和平。
    在各国关系中建立必要的信任后，就有可能着手实现下列根本措施：大量裁减武装部队和军备，完全禁止核武器，停止核武器的生产和销毁储存的核武器，从各国领土（包括北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约各成员国）撤除外国武装部队，用集体安全体系代替现在的各国军事集团。
    我们所面临的发展国际关系的这一重要关头或许比任何时候都更迫切地需要我们作出符合各国人民切身利益和意志的现实决定。过去的经验向我们说明，国家领导人要是正确地理解历史时机的要求，并根据这种要求行动，就能为各国人民的幸福作出多么大的贡献。
    我知道您、总统先生是一位目光远大、以和平为怀的人，我希望您正确地理解这个呼吁，意识到在当前的局势下落在美苏两国领导人身上的责任，准备联合我们两国的力量，以求达到一个崇高的目的——把事态的发展引向持久和平和各国人民友好合作。
    我们认为国家领导人的直接接触具有重大的意义，这样做能有助于在重大的国际问题上取得一致看法，我们这方面也准备同意大国领导人的直接会见，以便讨论这封信里提到的问题以及会见参加者认为需要讨论的其他问题。　　　　　　此致
    衷心的敬礼　　　　　　　　　尼·布尔加宁
