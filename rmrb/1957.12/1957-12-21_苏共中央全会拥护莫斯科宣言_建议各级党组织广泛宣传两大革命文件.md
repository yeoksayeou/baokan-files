Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 18th. TASS Moscow, December 18th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) plenary session on December 17th, 1957, adopted the "Resolution on the Results of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties," the full text of which is as follows:

    The Central Committee of the CPSU plenary session pointed out that the work of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties held in Moscow in November 1957 and the resolutions adopted by these two meetings are extremely significant achievements of the world communist movement. The meeting convincingly demonstrated the further unity of the socialist camp and of the entire international communist movement on the basis of Marxist-Leninist ideology. The most significant result of the meeting was the formulation and declaration of the most important tasks of the communists in the current stage of world history in the struggle for peace, democracy and socialism, the unity of the entire international communist movement and the further strengthening of ties between communist parties of various countries.

    The meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries and the meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of sixty-four countries held in Moscow signify an extremely important victory of the world communist movement and the workers' movement in ideology and politics. This victory is of even greater significance because the international reactionaries have recently tried their best to split the communist movement and cause confusion in its ranks. The results of the November meeting are a decisive blow to these plans of the reactionaries.

    The two declarations are permeated with the spirit that the Communist and Workers' Parties are aware of the lofty responsibilities they bear for the fate of the world socialist system, the fate of universal peace and the bright future of all mankind. The two declarations are documents with tremendous mobilization and organizational power. The Communist Party meeting declared that the task of striving for peace and peaceful coexistence is the fundamental issue in world politics, and pointed out the basic direction of the international workers' movement and communist movement, and the efforts of all peace-loving and progressive people in the modern context.

    The Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries is a model of creatively developing Marxism-Leninism on the basis of the collective experience of the Communist Parties. In the declaration, the workers' movement found a Marxist-Leninist evaluation of the current issues and main trends of the modern international situation. The declaration summarized the work experience of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries in building and consolidating the world socialist system. At the same time, the declaration also summarized the experience of the workers' movement in capitalist countries, as well as the experience of the national liberation struggles of the people of colonies and dependencies. In this way, the declaration analyzed and summarized the experience of virtually the entire international workers' movement and communist movement throughout the entire post-war period.

    The CPSU Central Committee plenary session noted with satisfaction that the conclusions and principles of the 20th Congress of the CPSU on the most important principled issues of modern international development were fully supported by the fraternal Communist Parties, which proves the ideological unity and solidarity of the entire international communist movement.

    In the meeting documents, the Communists expressed their willingness to cooperate with all parties, movements, and individuals who uphold peace and oppose war. This will promote the unity of all peace-loving, national and democratic forces around the working class and isolate the aggressive monopoly groups of big capital--the culprits of the arms race, the plotters and instigators of preparing a new world war.

    The Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties emphasized that cooperation and joint action between the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party are possible, whether in the struggle for the current interests of the working class or in the struggle to seize power and build socialism. The interests of the working people and the interests of striving for peace, democracy and socialism urgently require that all sincere socialists, all participants and activists in the workers' movement should listen to this call for joint action.

    The Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries pointed out that it is necessary to resolutely fight against revisionism, which is the main danger in the international communist movement under the current conditions; at the same time, it is also necessary to resolutely overcome dogmatism and sectarianism. This is of great significance for the ideological and organizational consolidation of the Communist Party. The Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries clarified the main laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction in all countries that have embarked on the socialist road, the issue of considering the national characteristics of various countries, the issue of strengthening the unity of socialist countries and the principles of mutual relations between socialist countries; it clarified the great historical significance of the world socialist system and the issue of further strengthening the world socialist system; it clarified the different forms of transition to socialism in various countries; in this way, it armed the Communist Party with powerful theoretical weapons to strive for the victory of socialism, and gave a blow to opportunists.

    The CPSU Central Committee plenary session particularly noted with satisfaction the great significance of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties in further developing the ties and cooperation between the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries. The conclusion made by the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties that, in addition to holding bilateral talks between leaders and exchanging information with each other, it is also necessary to hold broader meetings of Communist and Workers' Parties, is fully in line with the needs of the current stage of development of the world communist movement and the historical tasks it faces in the struggle for peace, democracy and socialism.

    The work of the Communist Party meeting clearly confirmed the deep sympathy and trust of the fraternal parties for our party and the Soviet people. On the day of celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the unshakable prestige of the Soviet Union in the minds of working people all over the world was once again demonstrated. The Soviet Communists and all the Soviet people believe that their internationalist responsibility to the international workers' movement and the working people of all countries is: to victoriously carry out the construction of a communist society, to consolidate the power of our country and the entire socialist camp, to unremittingly fight for peace among the people of all countries, and to strengthen friendship and proletarian solidarity with the working people and democratic forces all over the world.

    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes that the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and the Peace Declaration are the most important documents guiding the actions of the Soviet Communists. These two declarations have been unanimously and warmly supported by party activists and all party members in the republics, border regions and states, at meetings of city and district party activists, and within grassroots organizations. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union will continue to strengthen fraternal ties with all Communist and Workers' Parties, and ensure that all the Soviet people are educated in the spirit of closely integrating Soviet patriotism with proletarian internationalism and in the spirit of friendship and respect for the people of socialist camp countries and the working people of all countries.

    The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided:

    1. To fully endorse the historic documents adopted by the meeting--the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and the Peace Declaration.

    2. To approve the activities of the CPSU Central Committee delegation at the Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties.

    3. It is recommended that party organizations at all levels widely publicize the significance of the Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties and the content of the two documents adopted at the meeting to all party members and working people, and carry out mass political work around the results of the meeting to further mobilize the masses to successfully realize the tasks of our country's communist construction, and strengthen the work of educating the Soviet working people in the spirit of Soviet patriotism, proletarian internationalism, and friendship with the peace-loving people of all countries.

    苏共中央全会拥护莫斯科宣言
    建议各级党组织广泛宣传两大革命文件
    新华社19日讯  塔斯社莫斯科18日电：苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议1957年12月17日通过了关于共产党和工人党代表会议的结果的决议，全文如下：
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议指出，1957年11月在莫斯科举行的共产党和工人党代表会议的工作和这两次会议所通过的决议是世界共产主义运动的极其重大的成就。会议令人信服地显示了社会主义阵营和整个国际共产主义运动在马克思列宁主义思想基础上的进一步团结。制定和宣布共产党人在世界历史的现阶段在争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中的最重大的任务、整个国际共产主义运动的团结和各国共产党之间联系的进一步加强，是会议的最重大的结果。
    在莫斯科举行的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议和六十四个国家的共产党和工人党代表会议，意味着世界共产主义运动和工人运动在思想上和政治上极其重大的胜利。由于近来国际反动派极力想分裂共产主义运动和在它的队伍中引起混乱，这个胜利的意义就更为重大。11月会议的结果对反动派的这些计划是决定性的打击。
    两项宣言贯穿着这样的精神：共产党和工人党意识到自己对世界社会主义体系的命运、对普遍和平的命运和对全人类光辉的未来所负的崇高责任。两项宣言是具有巨大的动员力量和组织力量的文件。共产党会议宣布争取和平及和平共处的任务是世界政治中的根本问题，并且指出了在现代情况下国际工人运动和共产主义运动、一切爱好和平的进步人类努力的基本方向。
    社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言是在共产党集体经验的基础上创造性地发展马克思列宁主义的典范。工人运动在宣言中找到了对现代国际局势当前问题和当代主要趋向的马克思列宁主义的评价。宣言总结了社会主义国家共产党和工人党在建立和巩固世界社会主义体系方面的工作经验。同时宣言也总结了资本主义国家工人运动的经验，以及殖民地和附属国人民民族解放斗争经验。这样，宣言就分析和总结了实际上是整个战后时期的整个国际工人运动和共产主义运动的经验。
    苏共中央全会满意地指出，苏共第二十次代表大会关于现代国际发展的最重要的原则问题的结论和原理得到了兄弟共产党的完全支持，这就证明整个国际共产主义运动的思想一致和团结。
    共产党人在会议文件中表示愿意同一切拥护和平、反对战争的党派、运动和个人进行合作，这样就会促进全体爱好和平的、民族的和民主的力量团结在工人阶级的周围，就会把大资本的侵略垄断集团——军备竞赛的祸首、准备新世界大战的阴谋的策划者和鼓吹者——孤立起来。
    共产党和工人党代表会议强调指出，不论在争取工人阶级目前的利益的斗争中，或者在夺取政权和建设社会主义的斗争中，共产党同社会民主党的合作和共同行动都是可能的。劳动人民的利益，争取和平、民主和社会主义的利益迫切地要求，一切真诚的社会党人、一切工人运动的参加者和活动家都应当听取这个共同行动的呼吁。
    社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言中指出，必须坚决地同修正主义进行斗争，修正主义在目前条件下是国际共产主义运动中的主要危险；同时也必须坚决地克服教条主义和宗派主义。这一点对于共产党的思想上和组织上的巩固具有重大的意义。社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言中阐明了所有走上社会主义道路的国家在社会主义革命和社会主义建设方面的主要规律的问题、考虑各国民族特点的问题、必须加强社会主义国家的团结以及社会主义国家之间相互关系的原则的问题；阐明了世界社会主义体系的伟大历史意义以及必须进一步加强世界社会主义体系的问题；阐明了各国过渡到社会主义的不同形式的问题；这样，就以强大的理论武器武装了共产党去争取社会主义的胜利，并且给机会主义者以打击。
    苏共中央全会特别满意地指出共产党和工人党代表会议在进一步发展各国共产党和工人党之间的联系和合作方面的巨大意义。共产党和工人党代表会议所作出的关于除了举行领导人员的双边会谈和相互交换情况以外，还必须举行更广泛的共产党和工人党的会议这个结论，完全符合世界共产主义运动发展的现阶段的需要以及它所面临的争取和平、民主和社会主义斗争的历史任务。
    共产党代表会议的工作明显地证实了各兄弟党对我们党、对苏联人民的深切同情和信任。在庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的日子里又一次显示出苏联在全世界劳动人民心目中的不可动摇的威信。苏联共产党员和全体苏联人民认为自己对国际工人运动和各国劳动人民的国际主义职责是：胜利地进行共产主义社会的建设、巩固我国和整个社会主义阵营的威力、不懈地为各国人民间的和平而斗争、加强同全世界劳动人民和民主力量的友谊和无产阶级团结。
    苏联共产党认为社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言和和平宣言是指导苏联共产党员行动的最重要的文件。这两个宣言在各共和国、边疆区和州的党的积极分子和全体党员中间、在市和区的党的积极分子会议上以及基层组织内，都受到了一致的、热烈的拥护。苏联共产党今后仍将不断地加强同所有共产党和工人党的兄弟联系，保证以苏维埃爱国主义同无产阶级国际主义密切结合的精神，以对社会主义阵营国家的人民和各国劳动人民友好和尊敬的精神教育全体苏联人民。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议决定：
    一、完全拥护会议所通过的历史性文件——社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言和和平宣言。
    二、批准苏共中央代表团在共产党和工人党会议上的活动。
    三、建议各级党组织向全体党员和劳动人民广泛宣传共产党和工人党会议的意义和会议所通过的两个文件的内容，围绕会议结果展开群众政治工作来进一步动员群众成功地实现我国共产主义建设的任务，加强以苏维埃爱国主义、无产阶级国际主义和同各国爱好和平的人民友好的精神教育苏联劳动人民的工作。
