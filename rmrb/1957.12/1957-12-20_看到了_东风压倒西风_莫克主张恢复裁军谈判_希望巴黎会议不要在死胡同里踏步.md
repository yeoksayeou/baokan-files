Seeing "The East Wind Prevails over the West Wind"
    Moch Advocates Resuming Disarmament Talks
    Hoping the Paris Conference Won't Stagnate
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th: French representative to the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee, Moch, recently published an article in "Le Monde" saying that the successful launch of the Soviet intercontinental rocket has made the West's "entire military concept problematic." He advocated that the West emerge from the "dead end" on the disarmament issue and propose new proposals. In the article Moch published on the eve of the North Atlantic Group government leaders' meeting, he stated that one of the primary changes caused by this development is that the United States is "on the front line," its two-ocean barrier has been broken, and the United States has shifted from a purely offensive position to a position where it can be attacked.
    He believes that, due to this change, the West's "entire military concept has become problematic." "Militarily speaking, we (the West) are no longer the center of the universe." Strategically, the "peripheral strategy concept" and regional military alliances "have lost their military effectiveness."
    Moch then talked about the North Atlantic Group government leaders' meeting aimed at strengthening the nuclear arms race, saying, "I admit I am not very enthusiastic about this meeting." He said that, given the increasing global awareness of the nuclear threat and the increasingly strong desire to end the nuclear arms race, if this meeting still insists on the Western proposals that have been rejected by the Soviet Union on the disarmament issue, it would be "stagnating in a dead end" and "insisting on following the old path." He said that only by reconsidering the current situation and proposing new proposals can such negotiations be resumed. But he said that, judging from the preparations for the meeting, no one can see any signs of this.

    看到了“东风压倒西风”
    莫克主张恢复裁军谈判
    希望巴黎会议不要在死胡同里踏步
    据新华社19日讯　巴黎消息：法国出席联合国裁军小组委员会的代表莫克最近在“世界报”发表文章说，苏联洲际火箭的发射成功已经使西方的“一切军事概念都成了问题”。他主张西方在裁军问题上走出“死胡同”，并且提出新的方案。莫克在北大西洋集团政府首脑会议开幕前夕发表的这篇文章中谈到，这种发展所引起的一个首要变化是使美国“处在第一线”，美国的两洋屏障被打破了，美国已经从单纯打人的地位转而处于可以被打的地位。
    他认为，由于这种变化，西方的“一切军事概念都成了问题”。“从军事上说，我们（西方）不再是宇宙的中心”。从战略上说，“外围战略概念”和地区性的军事联盟“已经丧失了军事实效”。
    莫克接着谈到旨在加强核军备竞赛的北大西洋集团政府首脑会议，他说，“我承认我对这个会议不怎么热心。”他说，鉴于全世界对核威胁的认识越来越普遍和结束核军备竞赛的愿望越来越强烈，如果这次会议在裁军问题上仍然坚持已经为苏联所拒绝的西方建议，那是“在死胡同里踏步”，“坚持照着老路走”。他说，只有重新考虑现在的情况提出新方案，才能恢复这种谈判。但是他说，从会议的准备情况来看，谁都不能看出有这种迹象。
