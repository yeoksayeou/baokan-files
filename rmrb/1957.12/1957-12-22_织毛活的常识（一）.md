Common Knowledge of Knitting (1)
    A person who doesn't know how to knit a sweater often encounters the following difficulties when they want to knit one: How much yarn should I buy? What kind of needles should I use? How big should I knit it?
    Now, let me introduce some general common sense:
    1. The amount of yarn needed varies depending on the thickness of the yarn and the style of knitting. Generally, for a men's sweater (without patterns, the same below), about twenty to twenty-two *shi liang* of thick yarn (100-count yarn, such as Peace Brand, Worker-Peasant Brand, etc.) are needed, and about twelve to fourteen *shi liang* of thin yarn (300-count, such as Qiyang Brand, Diyang Brand) are needed.
    For a women's sweater, twenty *shi liang* of thick yarn is needed, and about ten *shi liang* of thin yarn is enough. A child's sweater needs eight *shi liang* of thick yarn, and only about five *shi liang* of thin yarn.
    2. The knitting needles should be suitable for the thickness of the yarn. If the needles are too thick, the knitted sweater will be too loose; if they are too thin, it will not only be time-consuming and use more yarn, but the knitted sweater will also be too dense and too hard, and it will not be warm to wear. However, thinner needles can be used when knitting the hem, cuffs, and collar of the garment. This can maintain the elasticity of the hem and cuffs, make the sweater look better, and save yarn.
    3. The number of stitches to cast on depends on the person's size and the thickness of the yarn. Generally, for thick yarn (100-count), nine stitches are about one *shi cun* wide, and for thin yarn (300-count), twelve stitches are about one *shi cun* wide. Before casting on, measure the size and calculate it according to the above ratio. (Yu Wenzhen) (with picture)

    织毛活的常识（一）
    一个不会织毛衣的人，当他想织一件毛衣的时候，常常会碰到这样一些困难：该买多少线？该用什么样的针？该织多大？
    现在介绍几点一般性的常识：
    一、毛线由于粗细不同和织的样式各异，用线多少也就有不同。一般男人毛衣（不织花，下同），需用粗线（100号的毛线如和平牌、工农牌等）二十到二十二市两，细线（300号的，如奇羊牌、羝羊牌）约用十二到十四市两。
    织一件女毛衣，用粗线需二十市两，用细线约十市两就够了。儿童毛衣需要粗线八市两，用细线只要五市两左右。
    二、织毛衣的针要和毛线的粗细相适应。针过粗，织出来的毛衣就会太松；过细，不但费工费线，织出的毛衣也太密太硬，穿起来不暖和。但是，织衣服下摆、袖口、领子的时候，可以用较细的针。这样既可保持衣边和袖口的松紧，毛衣样式较好看，用线也较省。
    三、起针多少和人身体肥瘦、毛线粗细都有关系。一般粗线（100号）九针宽约一市寸，细线（300号）十二针宽约一市寸。起针前，可量好尺寸，按上述比例计算就行了。  （余文贞）（附图片）
