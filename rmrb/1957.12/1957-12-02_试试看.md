Try it out

　　This plate contains a small amount of water. Can you use a teacup smaller than the plate to completely scoop all the water in the plate into the cup?
　　(As shown in the picture)
　　You only need to prepare a match and a piece of waste paper. Light the waste paper and put it in the cup. After a while, turn the cup upside down onto the plate, and the water in the plate will naturally run into the cup.
　　What is the reason for this? Because the temperature in the cup increases due to the burning of the waste paper, and the air expands. After being inverted onto the plate, the waste paper goes out and the temperature in the cup decreases. In this way, the air pressure in the cup decreases (the magnitude of the air pressure is related to the temperature), and the external atmospheric pressure is greater than the pressure inside the cup, so it can push the water in the plate into the cup. (Yang Yongpei) Yesterday's answer: There can be many license plate numbers that meet the conditions, such as: "1021", "2143", "4185", etc. (with picture)

　　试试看
    这个盘子中盛有少量的水，你能用一个比盘子小的茶杯，将盘中的水全部扣进杯子中吗？
      （如图）
    你只要准备好一根火柴和一张废纸就行了。将废纸点着，放进杯中，待一会儿，将杯扣进盘中，盘中的水就自然地跑进杯子里去了。
    这是什么原因呢？因为杯中由于废纸的燃烧，温度增高，空气膨胀。待扣进盘中后，废纸熄灭，杯中温度就降低。这样杯中气压减小（气压的大小和温度有关），而外部的大气压大于杯内的压力，所以就能把盘中的水压进杯里了。（杨永培）昨日答案：这辆汽车牌照的号码合乎条件的可以有很多种，如：“1021”“2143”“4185”等等。（附图片）
