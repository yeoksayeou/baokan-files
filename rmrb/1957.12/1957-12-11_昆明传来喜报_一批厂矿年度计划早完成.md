Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 9th. As of now, twenty-one state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories and mines in Kunming City have completed their annual production plans for this year ahead of schedule.

During the rectification campaign, workers and staff in various factories and mines in Kunming City put forward nearly 200,000 suggestions. Leading cadres of various factories and mines earnestly improved their work based on the opinions of the masses, and as a result, the production enthusiasm of the vast number of workers and staff was unprecedentedly high. Yunfeng Paper Mill, which had been unable to complete its plan since 1955, has been completing its plan every month since the start of the rectification. After the Yipinglang Salt Factory mobilized the masses to solve the problem of the quality of the main raw material - brine - and the power problem, which had not been solved for several years, at the recent workers' representative conference discussing rectification issues, it also reversed the situation of being unable to complete the plan for a long time from October. Kunming Smelter, which had completed the first five-year plan target one year and four months ahead of schedule, mobilized its workers to formulate 277 measures for popularizing new technologies and advanced experiences this year, and completed the annual total output value, labor productivity, and profit plans ahead of schedule.

    昆明传来喜报
    一批厂矿年度计划早完成
    新华社昆明9日电　到目前为止，昆明市有二十一个国营、地方国营和公私合营厂矿提前完成今年全年生产计划。
    在整风运动中，昆明市各厂矿职工共提出近二十万条意见。各厂矿领导干部根据群众意见认真改进了工作，因此广大职工生产热情空前高涨。1955年以来一直不能完成计划的云丰造纸厂，从整风开始以来就月月完成计划。一平浪盐厂在最近举行的讨论整风问题的职工代表大会上，发动群众解决了几年来一直没有解决的主要原料——卤水质量问题和动力问题以后，也从10月份扭转了长期不能完成计划的局面。已经提前一年零四个月完成第一个五年计划指标的昆明冶炼厂，今年又发动职工制定了二百七十七项推广新技术和先进经验的措施，又提前完成了今年全年总产值、劳动生产率和利润计划。
