Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 28th: In its economic report to the Asian-African Solidarity Conference plenary session on the 26th, the Syrian delegation advocated that Asian and African countries should coordinate their economic plans and conduct full cooperation and mutual support based on the principles of promoting overall interests and mutual benefit.

The Syrian delegation also suggested organizing an economic cooperation organization among Asian and African countries after research, and suggested establishing a business agreement and payment committee, a technical cooperation committee, and establishing an economic development fund.

Syria's report stated that nationalization is a legitimate means and recognized right to support the national economy. Because Asia and Africa are considered one of the most important regions in the world in terms of wealth, raw material sources, and power and energy sources, nationalization is extremely important for the prosperity of these countries, for ending backwardness, and for realizing development plans.

In order to obtain the funds needed for Asian and African countries to realize their development plans, Syria's report suggested that the wealth that imperialist countries have exploited in Asia and Africa should be taken out as funds for national development plans. The report also suggested establishing a common Asian-African fund to fund their construction plans. The report stated that foreign investment without political conditions could be considered.

    亚非国家合作发展经济
    叙利亚代表团建议实行国有化
    并要帝国主义退还劫走的财富
    据新华社开罗28日电　叙利亚代表团在26日向亚非团结大会全体会议所作的经济报告中，主张亚非国家在促进全体利益和互利的原则下，协调彼此的经济计划，进行充分的合作和相互支援。
    叙利亚代表团还建议在经过研究的基础上组织一个亚非国家间的经济合作组织，建议成立商务协定和支付委员会、技术合作委员会，并设立经济发展基金。
    叙利亚的报告说，国有化是支持国民经济的合法手段和公认的权利。由于亚洲和非洲在财富和原料来源方面以及动力和能量来源方面，被认为是世界最重要的地区之一，因此，国有化对这些国家的繁荣，对结束落后状态，以及对实现发展计划都极其重要。
    为了取得亚非国家实现它们的发展计划所需要的资金，叙利亚的报告建议，应该把帝国主义国家在亚洲和非洲剥削得来的财富拿出来，作为国家发展计划的资金。报告还建议设立亚非共同基金以便资助它们的建设计划。报告说，不附带政治条件的外国投资可予以考虑。
