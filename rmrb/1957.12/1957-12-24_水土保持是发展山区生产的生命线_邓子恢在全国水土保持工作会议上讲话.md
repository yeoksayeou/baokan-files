Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd. Vice Premier of the State Council, Deng Zihui, proposed to the Second National Soil and Water Conservation Work Conference: "We must, on the basis of overall planning, carry out soil and water conservation work better and on a larger scale."

On the morning of December 16th, Vice Premier Deng Zihui delivered a speech at the Second National Soil and Water Conservation Work Conference. He said: The reason why soil and water conservation work is important is, first, because it is the lifeline for developing mountainous area production. First of all, it can protect the land. With soil and water conservation, the land will not be eroded by water or collapse; farmers will preserve the most basic means of production for striving for increased production; secondly, if the topsoil is not washed away, the fertility will also be preserved; furthermore, if water does not flow downhill, most of the rainwater will seep into the ground, making it easier for crops to grow and conserving water sources. With water and grass, animal husbandry can also be developed, and it can also promote the growth of forests, develop local specialties and sideline production, as well as the local specialty processing industry and transportation industry, and so on. From this, it can be seen that soil and water conservation is the most fundamental basic construction in mountainous area production.

Second, doing a good job in soil and water conservation in mountainous and hilly areas is the fundamental guarantee for the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production in the plains. This is because: if soil and water conservation work in mountainous and hilly areas is done well, it can reduce the water flow in the upper reaches of various rivers, and the downstream can reduce and avoid floods; if the upstream brings clear water, the downstream riverbed will not only not be silted up, but can gradually be deepened, and the rivers will not change course or breach; if there is a water source upstream, the river can have water all year round, and both upstream and downstream can draw water for irrigation during droughts. From this, it can be seen that it is wrong for the plains to be indifferent to soil and water conservation work in the mountains and should give strong support.

Third, doing a good job in soil and water conservation in mountainous areas will change the natural environment of the whole country. Afforestation is one of the important measures to do a good job in soil and water conservation. If the forest area of our country increases gradually from the current 7.9% of the land area to more than 30% in twenty years or less, it can not only control soil erosion, but also potentially regulate the climate, eradicate disasters such as waterlogging, drought, wind, and hail, and also reduce human and animal diseases due to normal rainfall and harmonious climate. Doing a good job in soil and water conservation can also protect large and small reservoirs and other water conservancy projects on various rivers, preventing them from being silted up and losing effectiveness or reducing their effectiveness; it can also raise the groundwater level, conserve water sources, and ensure water for industry, agriculture, and urban and rural residents. From this, it can be seen that soil and water conservation is not only the foundation for expanding agricultural reproduction, but also an important measure for developing the entire national economy.

When talking about how to do a good job in soil and water conservation work, Vice Premier Deng Zihui emphasized that the primary link is to unify understanding ideologically and correct incorrect views. He said that from the importance of soil and water conservation work, it can be seen that it is not only the task of mountainous areas or certain regions or a certain department, but the task of the entire Party and all the people, and any view that ignores or believes that "it has nothing to do with me" is wrong.

He pointed out that there is also a struggle between two roads in dealing with the issue of soil and water conservation. One is the road of capitalism and all exploiting classes, who not only adopt a predatory attitude towards people, but also a predatory attitude towards natural resources, only caring about reclaiming wasteland, plundering timber, mineral deposits, and other resources, and never considering the issue of soil erosion. The other is the socialist road, which does not adopt a predatory attitude towards natural resources, but an attitude of cultivating and accumulating, that is to say, when we develop mountainous resources, we must also take measures to prevent soil erosion, and in areas where soil erosion has already formed, we must carry out soil and water conservation work, control and eliminate soil erosion, and achieve water storage, soil conservation, and cultivation of land fertility.

He said that in recent years, the Party's proposition on carrying out soil and water conservation work and paying attention to preventing soil erosion has been valued by most regions, but some regions, mainly some regions in the South, still do not pay enough attention to it. He emphasized: In some mountainous areas in the South, due to the lack of sufficient attention to the issue of preventing soil erosion in logging, wasteland reclamation, fertilizer production, mining, and road construction, soil erosion has been increasing year by year in recent years. This phenomenon should arouse serious vigilance among the Party and government leading organs in various parts of the South. Do not be blindly optimistic because the four seasons are spring and plants are easy to grow; blind optimism will harm people and yourself, and also harm our descendants. We must see the serious consequences caused to the North by the destruction of war, the plunder of the feudal ruling class, and the indiscriminate logging and random reclamation over thousands of years. Do not turn the South into the North and cause serious soil erosion in the South. Do not adopt a predatory attitude towards natural resources, and pay attention to preventing soil erosion when developing mountainous resources. The rainfall in the South is much greater than in the North. If soil and water conservation in the South is damaged, soil erosion and floods will be more serious than in the North. Therefore, we must now pay attention to preventing damage to soil and water conservation. Prevention is always easier than treatment. If we do not pay attention to prevention now, it will take decades to treat after suffering.

He said that the idea that soil and water conservation work is "distant water that cannot quench immediate thirst" must be criticized and corrected. Many typical examples prove that the effective time of soil and water conservation work is not indefinitely long. Once it is started, it can be initially effective in three to five years, and soil erosion can be basically controlled in ten or twenty years in areas with serious soil erosion. He also criticized the erroneous understandings and views that "soil and water conservation work in mountainous areas is to serve the people downstream," "it is a matter for the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy departments," and "to engage in soil and water conservation, the state must invest."

In order to do a good job in soil and water conservation work, Vice Premier Deng Zihui emphasized "the Party committee attaches importance, the secretary is responsible, unified planning, and the entire Party takes action"; in carrying out soil and water conservation work, we must follow the mass line, study history, adapt to local conditions, and proceed from the perspective of the interests of the masses and the benefit of production, combining current interests with long-term interests. When talking about how to do a good job in soil and water conservation work, he emphasized the policy of concentrated treatment, comprehensive treatment, combining slope and gully treatment, and focusing on slope treatment, and pointed out the need to create typical examples, from point to area, and gradually promote them.

After talking about the policy of soil and water conservation work, he talked about the issue of speed. He said: The favorable conditions for carrying out soil and water conservation work now are: agricultural cooperation has been completed; we are currently in a high tide of agricultural production and mountainous area production, the masses have raised their awareness and are eager to do so; all regions have a set of mature experiences; all provinces have typical examples; and precious grasses such as alfalfa that can be promoted have been discovered, etc. Based on these favorable conditions, the problem of controlling soil erosion can be completed earlier. Now it should be proposed that areas with a large general population should strive to basically control soil erosion within ten years (the controlled area accounts for 70% of the soil erosion surface), the middle reaches of the Yellow River should generally reach it in about twenty years, and the South should complete it in one or two years, two or three years, or three to five years.

Vice Premier Deng Zihui also talked about several policy issues in soil and water conservation work. He said that first of all, it should be stipulated: (1) It is not allowed to destroy forests for wasteland reclamation, and terraced fields and ridges must be built when reclaiming sloping land, and individual reclamation should be restricted. (2) Planting trees should involve digging fish scale pits, building horizontal ditches, etc. (3) Mining and road construction units must be responsible for doing a good job in soil and water conservation. (4) The felling of timber and bamboo should not be concentrated along transportation lines, but should be carried out in a dispersed manner; the felling tasks of various regions should be appropriately stipulated, and felling must be combined with afforestation, planting more than felling, felling one and planting two or even more, and regeneration work must keep up. (5) Mountains should be closed for afforestation according to local conditions, but the production of the masses should be taken care of, and they should not be completely closed. Each township and commune should formulate covenants and prohibitions. (6) Agricultural cooperatives should prohibit the unlimited shoveling of sod to burn grass and wood ash for fertilizer. If it is necessary to make fertilizer, the source of fire must be controlled; strip shoveling should be implemented, and it should not be shoveled completely to avoid damaging soil and water conservation. (7) The cost of carrying out soil and water conservation should be borne according to the benefited mu, with more benefit bearing more and less benefit bearing less.

    水土保持是发展山区生产的生命线
    邓子恢在全国水土保持工作会议上讲话
    新华社23日讯　国务院副总理邓子恢向第二次全国水土保持工作会议提出：“必须在全面规划的基础上，把水土保持工作更好地、规模更大地开展起来。”
    16日上午，邓子恢副总理在第二次全国水土保持工作会议上讲了话。他说：水土保持工作之所以重要，第一，因为它是发展山区生产的生命线。首先，它能够保住土地，有了水土保持，土地便不致被水冲刷和崩裂塌陷；农民便保住了争取增产的最基本的生产资料；其次，表土不被冲走，也就保住了肥；再次，水不下坡，大部分雨水渗到地内，作物易于生长，并可涵养水源。有水有草，畜牧业也能发展起来，并可促进林木的成长，发展土特产和副业生产以及土特产加工业和交通运输业等等。由此可见，水土保持是山区生产中最根本的基本建设。
    第二，做好山区、丘陵区的水土保持工作是平原地区发展农、牧业生产的根本保证。这是因为：山区丘陵区的水土保持工作做好了，可以减少各河上游的来水，下游可以减少和避免发生水灾；上游来了清水，下游的河床不仅不致淤高，反可逐渐刷深，河流不致改道、决口；上游有了水源，河道可以长年有水，旱时上游下游都可引水灌溉。由此可见，平原地区对山区的水土保持工作漠不关心是不对的，应该给予大力支援。
    第三，做好山区水土保持工作将改变全国的自然环境。植树造林是做好水土保持工作的重要措施之一。如果我国森林面积由现在的占国土面积7.9％，在二十年或更短的时间内逐步地增加到30％以上，不仅可以控制水土流失，而且有可能调节气候，根除水、旱、风、雹等灾害，并因雨量正常气候调和，有可能减少人、畜的疫病。水土保持工作做好了，还能保护各河上的大、小水库和其他水利工程建筑，使之不致淤高失效或减少效能；还可提高地下水位，涵养水源，保证工、农业和城乡人民用水。由此可见，水土保持不仅是扩大农业再生产的基础，而且是发展整个国民经济事业的一项重要措施。
    邓子恢副总理谈到如何做好水土保持工作时，着重指出：首要的一环是必须在思想上统一认识，纠正不正确的观点。他说，从水土保持工作的重要性中就可看出，它不光是山区或某些地区、某一部门的任务，而是全党全民的任务，任何忽视或认为“与我无关”的看法都是错误的。
    他指出：在对待水土保持的问题上，也存在着两条道路的斗争。一条是资本主义和一切剥削阶级的道路，他们不仅对人采取掠夺态度，而且对于自然资源也采取掠夺的态度，只顾垦荒、掠夺木材、矿藏等富源，从不顾及水土流失问题。另一条是社会主义的道路，对自然资源不是采取掠夺态度，而是采取培养积累的态度，也就是说我们在开发山区富源时，同时要采取措施防止水土流失，在已经形成水土流失的地区，要开展水土保持工作，控制和消灭水土流失，做到蓄水保土、培养地力。
    他说：几年来，党的关于开展水土保持工作注意防止水土流失的主张，已为大部分地区重视起来，但是还有一部分地区主要是南方的某些地区还重视不够。他强调指出：南方有些山区由于在伐木、开荒、造肥、采矿、修路等工作中对防止水土流失问题没有给予足够的重视，近年来水土流失现象逐年出现。这种现象应该引起南方各地党政领导机关严重警惕，不要看到四季皆春草木易长就盲目乐观；盲目乐观就要害人害己，还要害我们的后代。要看到战争的破坏、封建统治阶级的掠夺和千百年来的滥采滥伐随意开荒给北方造成的严重后果，不要再把南方变成北方，使南方形成严重水土流失；不要对自然资源采取掠夺态度，要在开发山区富源时就注意防止水土流失。南方的雨量比北方大得多，如果南方的水土保持受到破坏，水土流失和洪水为害要比北方更为严重，因此，现在必须注意防止破坏水土保持，防止总比治理容易，如果现在不注意防止，将来受害之后就要花上几十年的工夫来治理。
    他说：认为水土保持工作是“远水不解近渴”的思想，必须加以批判和纠正。很多的典型事例证明，水土保持工作的收效时间并不是遥遥无期的，搞起来，在三、五年内就可初步见效，水土流失严重地区十年二十年也可以基本控制。他还批判了认为“山区水土保持工作是为下游人民服务”、“是农、林、水利部门的事情”、“要搞水土保持就要国家投资”等错误认识和观点。
    为了做好水土保持工作，邓子恢副总理强调要“党委重视，书记负责，统一规划，全党动手”；在开展水土保持工作中，要走群众路线，要研究历史，因地制宜，要从群众利益和有利生产的观点出发，使当前利益和长远利益结合起来。在谈到如何做好水土保持工作时，他着重指出集中治理、综合治理、坡沟兼治、治坡为主的方针，并指出要创造典型，由点到面，逐步推广。
    他在谈了水土保持工作的方针以后，又谈了速度问题。他说：现在开展水土保持工作的有利条件是：农业合作化已经完成；当前正处在农业生产和山区生产高潮之中，群众觉悟提高，要求迫切；各地都有了一套成熟经验；各省都有了典型；还发现了可以推广的草木樨等宝贝草，等等，根据这些有利条件，控制水土流失问题，是可以提早完成的。现在应该提出：一般人口较多地区争取在十年内基本上控制水土流失（控制面积占水土流失面70％），黄河中游一般应在二十年左右的时间内达到，南方应在一、二年二、三年或三、五年内完成。
    邓子恢副总理还谈到水土保持工作中的几个政策问题。他说，首先应该规定：（一）不准毁林开荒，开垦坡地必须修梯田修地埂，个人开荒应加限制。（二）造林要挖鱼鳞坑，筑水平沟等。（三）采矿、修路的工程单位须负责做好水土保持。（四）采伐木材竹材不要集中在交通沿线，要分散采伐；要适当地规定各地的采伐任务，并须采伐与造林合一，造多于砍，砍一造二甚至更多，迹地更新工作必须跟上。（五）要因地制宜地封山育林，但要照顾群众生产，不要封死，各乡、社要订出公约禁条。（六）农业社要禁止无限制地铲草皮烧草木灰造肥，非造不可时一定要控制火源；要实行带状铲草，不能铲光，不能破坏水土保持。（七）开展水土保持的费用，应按收益地亩负担，多收益多负担，少收益少负担。
