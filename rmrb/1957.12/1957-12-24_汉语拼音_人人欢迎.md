    Hanyu Pinyin Welcomed by Everyone
    Workers Determined to Learn
    On the evening of December 11th, activists in cultural learning and some illiterate and semi-literate workers from the Fengtai Bridge Factory held a discussion meeting. At the meeting, Liu Wenrong, a teacher at the spare-time cultural school, read to everyone the State Council's decision on the promulgation of the draft Hanyu Pinyin scheme and introduced the good results of using pinyin letters to spell out sounds. The workers were increasingly happy as they listened and expressed their support for the scheme. Wang Xincheng, a 51-year-old worker in the transportation workshop, said, "I didn't know a single character for more than 40 years in the old society. I only learned a few characters in literacy classes after liberation. Now that the State Council has announced the draft Hanyu Pinyin scheme, it is simple and quick to learn Chinese characters using the pinyin method, which is really good. The Party is helping us to think of every possible way to remove the label of illiteracy. I will definitely study hard in the future." The good news of the promulgation of the draft Hanyu Pinyin scheme greatly encouraged the learning enthusiasm of every worker.　Fengtai Bridge Factory　Wu Yanzhong
    Helping Minority People Learn Chinese
    I warmly welcome the promulgation of the draft Hanyu Pinyin scheme. Based on my experience of learning Chinese using Hanyu Pinyin letters, the Hanyu Pinyin scheme does help minority people learn Chinese. When I first started learning Chinese, the first difficulty I encountered was that Chinese characters have many strokes and are difficult to write, and one character has one sound, and some pronunciations are not clear, making them very difficult to remember. However, after learning the draft Hanyu Pinyin scheme, using pinyin letters to annotate Chinese characters makes the pronunciation more accurate. Even if I cannot learn complex Chinese characters for a while, I can easily understand books and newspapers written in pinyin letters. The Hanyu Pinyin scheme is of great significance to all ethnic minorities in China to learn Chinese, master advanced scientific and cultural knowledge, and accelerate the economic and cultural development of ethnic minorities. We should study hard.

    Annotating Trademarks with Pinyin Facilitates Learning
    The draft Hanyu Pinyin scheme has been announced by the State Council. This is an extremely happy and exciting event. The draft Hanyu Pinyin scheme announced this time has many advantages over the draft announced in 1956. In order to cooperate with the new situation of the rapid surge of China's economic construction, I suggest that pinyin be annotated to Chinese characters as widely as possible within a given range. In addition to what was mentioned in the articles by Comrades Wu Yuzhang and Li Jinxi, pinyin should be annotated on all commodity trademarks, names, and advertisements, because commodities are closely related to people's lives, and annotating them with pinyin will enable people to quickly become familiar with the pinyin scheme.

    Men, Women, Old, and Young Should All Learn
    The Hanyu Pinyin letters have been announced by the State Council, which is a great happy event for the people of our country. This set of letters is very easy to learn. We should use all means to promote it so that the people of the whole country, regardless of men, women, old, and young, can learn it in a relatively short period of time. I hope that this set of letters can be used to annotate the autumn 1958 elementary school Chinese textbooks. I also suggest that pinyin letters be written on children's toys and that more children's toys with pinyin letters be designed. In this way, when our little darlings enter elementary school, they will already be familiar with the shapes and pronunciations of these twenty-six letters. This is not my original idea; all countries that use pinyin letters use this method to educate preschool children. I hope that the relevant departments will pay attention to studying this issue.　Ye Xi

    汉语拼音  人人欢迎
    工人决心学
    12月11日晚上，丰台桥梁工厂文化学习积极分子和一部分文盲、半文盲职工举行了座谈会。在会上，业余文化学校教师刘文荣给大家读了国务院关于公布汉语拼音方案草案的决定，还介绍了用拼音字母拼音的良好效果。职工们越听越高兴，纷纷表示拥护这个方案。运输车间五十一岁的老工人王新成说：“在旧社会里四十多年，我连一个字都不认识。解放后我在识字班里才认识点字。现在国务院公布了汉语拼音方案草案，用拼音的办法来学习汉字，又简单，又快，真是好。党帮助我们想尽一切办法，摘掉文盲的帽子。今后我一定好好的学习”。汉语拼音方案草案公布的这个好消息，大大地鼓舞了每个职工的学习情绪。　丰台桥梁工厂　吴延忠
    帮助少数民族人民学习汉语
    我热烈欢迎汉语拼音方案草案的公布。就我用汉语拼音字母学习汉语的经验来看，汉语拼音方案确实有助于少数民族人民学习汉语。当我刚开始学汉语时，首先碰到的困难就是汉字笔划多难写，而且一个字一个音，有些读音也不清楚，很不容易记。但是学习了汉语拼音方案草案以后，用拼音字母来给汉字注音，读音就比较准确，即使一时学不会繁难的汉字，也能较容易看懂用拼音字母拼写的书报。汉语拼音方案对我国各少数民族人民学习汉语，掌握先进的科学文化知识，加速少数民族的经济文化发展具有重大意义。我们应该努力学习。

    给商标注音便利学习
    汉语拼音方案草案已经由国务院公布了。这是令人极其高兴和兴奋的事。这次公布的汉语拼音方案草案，比1956年公布的草案有很多优点。为了配合我国经济建设迅速高涨的新形势，我建议在既定范围内尽可能广泛地给汉字注音。除吴玉章和黎锦熙同志的文章中提到的以外，应该在一切商品的商标、名称和广告上注音，因为商品和人们生活的关系密切，给它注音就能使拼音方案很快为人们所熟悉。
  　杨春旭
    男女老幼都要学
    汉语拼音字母由国务院公布了，这是我们全国人民的大喜事。这套字母是很容易学的，我们应该用一切办法来推广，使在较短期间全国人民，无论男女老幼，都能学会。我希望在1958年秋季的小学语文课本上能用这套字母注音。我还建议：在小孩的玩具上写上拼音字母；多设计一些拼音字母的儿童玩具。这样，当我们的小宝贝进小学的时候，他们对于这二十六个字母的形体和读音已经很熟悉了。这并不是我的创见，一切使用拼音字母的国家都用这样的办法来教育学前儿童的。希望有关部门注意研究这个问题。　叶希
