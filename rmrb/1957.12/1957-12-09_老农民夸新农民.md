　　Old Farmers Praise New Farmers
　　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhu Bin
    November 26th marked a full month since over six hundred teachers and cadres from Renmin University were sent to the suburbs of Beijing to participate in agricultural production. On this day, Cui Yaoxian, the Deputy Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the university, visited the Sino-Czech Friendship Production Cooperative to see the one hundred and forty-odd new farmers who had been sent there. I took the opportunity to go with him.
    It happened to be the first clear day after a heavy snowfall, and the temperature had plummeted to around minus four degrees Celsius. The piercing northwest wind felt like knives on the face. As soon as we saw the village of the Sino-Czech Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative, we saw several farmers diverting water to irrigate the wheat fields. One of them had his trouser legs rolled up to his knees, working barefoot in the water. This barefoot farmer was Lu Wenhao, a physical education instructor sent down from Renmin University. His face was dark and red, and he shook hands with Cui Yaoxian with a smile, showing no sign of being cold. I learned from Zhai Liangchao, the leader of this team of new farmers, that Lu Wenhao was one of the "Five Tiger Generals" praised by the old farmers. Zhai Liangchao said that the "Five Tiger Generals" were Lu Wenhao, Gong Peishan, Chen Zhenbang, and Dong Mingshuang, four physical education instructors, and Zeng Shaolun, an assistant instructor from the National Economy Teaching and Research Office. All five were tall and strong, and they were in the same production team. They could not only do heavy work such as digging sweet potatoes, digging ditches, and irrigating fields, but they could also do it well. All five were also athletes, and during their breaks they often played basketball together. They held three matches with teachers and students from a nearby school and won all three times. That's how the name "Five Tiger Generals" spread among the farmers.
    We entered the village of the cooperative, and the new farmers who were threshing corn and winnowing peanuts in the square in front of the village swarmed around Cui Yaoxian, eagerly reporting their production achievements. Some proudly told Cui Yaoxian: the road in front of the village you just walked on was built by us, the new and old farmers, working through the night before it froze. Cui Yaoxian and other cadres who came with him could not help but pick up shovels and start digging. We visited dozens of production teams, and the production performance of all teams, both men and women, was already comparable to that of a medium-level farmer. Men could earn twelve to fourteen work points a day, and women could earn about nine work points.
    The farmers and cadres of the Sino-Czech Friendship Production Cooperative sincerely liked these new farmers, praising these teachers and cadres for treating the cooperative as their home and working wholeheartedly. In the early morning, before the old farmers went to the fields, these new farmers were already working in the fields, and they were also the last to leave work in the evening. They were willing to do any kind of work, filling cattle sheds, digging pig manure, even the dirtiest jobs that intellectuals would normally find repulsive.
    In the Nanyingzhuang production team, the old farmers were still talking about the three teachers who participated in digging a well. Digging a well was a job that was usually reserved for the strongest and most hard-working people among the old farmers. Initially, the production team only selected five old farmers, so progress was slow. The lecturers Su Guoheng and Su Suqing, and Lu Xun, the secretary of the general branch of the Marxism-Leninism Teaching and Research Office, who had never even seen a well being dug, repeatedly asked the production team leader to let them participate in this work. The old farmers were worried that they would not be able to endure the hardship, but after they went down into the well, they raised their picks and shoveled the soil like the old farmers, and then switched to shovels to shovel the soil. They not only ensured that the soil was constantly sent up the well, but also busied themselves with draining the water. When they climbed out of the well, they were soaked to the bone. The old farmers were very moved when they saw them still laughing and joking as usual, and they officially accepted them into the well-digging team.
    The old farmers also particularly praised the suggestions made by some cadres from the Economics Department of Renmin University on the design of the project to divert water to irrigate the wheat fields. The original channel design of the cooperative would have destroyed four mu of wheat fields. He Wei, an economics instructor who was sent down, proposed a plan after several measurements and studies that would not increase the amount of channel engineering work and would also preserve the original four mu of wheat fields. From then on, the farmers called He Wei "Engineer." He Wei did indeed become an engineer in the production team. Nine years ago, he participated in the Great Production Movement in the old liberated areas of Central Hebei and knew the technology of converting dry land into irrigated land. The farmers of the Sino-Czech Friendship Cooperative were irrigating land for the first time this year, so they regarded He Wei as a consultant.
    The old farmers loved the new farmers, and these new farmers also loved the old farmers. They had forged a deep friendship during their short month of working together. Lin Peizhi and three other female teachers from the Journalism Department and Liu Yulan, the female squad leader who guided their production, were known as the five sisters. During the day, Liu Yulan taught Lin Peizhi and others how to produce, and in the evening, Lin Peizhi and others taught Liu Yulan how to read. Almost every female teacher and cadre who was sent down here now serves as a cultural instructor for the old farmers. Their teaching method is called "three unfixeds": unfixed time, unfixed location, and unfixed number of students. At noon, we took advantage of the new farmers' lunch break to visit their dormitories. More than a dozen cadres from the Industrial Economics Department were gathered together drafting the regulations for the shock brigade. When they saw us come in, a young man first pointed to a tall man next to him and introduced him to us: his original name was Qi Shengcai, now he is called "Big Flag," and he is the leader of our shock brigade. Later, after we understood their idea of organizing the shock brigade, we realized that the title "Big Flag" was actually a code name used by these new farmers to urge themselves forward. After Qi Shengcai and others came to this production team, they found that the team's production plan was not well arranged and that some work had not been completed according to the cooperative's regulations. On the one hand, they helped the production team leader arrange the plan, and on the other hand, they organized more than a dozen people with strong physical strength to rush to harvest, sometimes working a few extra hours in the evening. Qi Shengcai completed a large amount of work every day, and one day he dug nine ridges of carrots, creating a new record for digging carrots in this agricultural cooperative. Therefore, everyone elected him as the leader of the shock brigade and called him "Big Flag." Before being sent down, Qi Shengcai was a mathematics instructor at Renmin University. He came from a typical intellectual family. His father had been working as an English teacher for more than thirty years, his brother was an engineer, his sister was a doctor, and his wife was also a teacher. No one in his family had ever participated in physical labor. Qi Shengcai told reporters that he fell in love with the countryside when he came to the countryside, and he especially loved the farmers' simple and hardworking qualities. A few days ago, when it was snowing and they were feeling cold in the house, the production team leader and the farmers sent them corn cobs and personally heated the kang for them. Qi Shengcai said: "Isn't this just 'sending charcoal in the snow'! I will learn a lot from being with such people." In our contact with these new farmers, we found that most of them were considering further efforts. When we said goodbye to the teachers who were sent down from the Journalism Department, some of them jokingly said: "A month of labor has cured our neurasthenia, and we want to further cure our ideological illness."

### 老农民夸新农民

　　老农民夸新农民
　　新华社记者　朱彬
    11月26日，是中国人民大学六百多教师和干部下放到北京郊区参加农业生产整一个月的日子。这个学校的中共党委副书记崔耀先在这一天去中捷友好生产合作社，访问了下放到这个合作社的一百四十多个新农民。我乘着这个机会也跟着他一起去了。
    那天偏巧是大雪后初晴的第一天，气温骤然下降到零下四度左右，凛冽的西北风刮得面如刀割的痛。我们刚看到中捷友好农业生产合作社的庄子，就看到几个农民在引水浇麦地，其中有一个人裤管卷到了膝上，赤着双脚在水里弄土。这位赤脚的农民就是人民大学下放的体育教员陆文灏，他的脸又黑又红，笑着和崔耀先握手，没有一点畏冷的样子，我看见在他脚边的一些水潭已经结起了薄冰。经过带领这支新农民队伍的负责人翟良超的介绍，知道陆文灏是受老农民赞扬的“五虎将”中的一员。翟良超说：“五虎将”就是陆文灏、龚培山、陈振邦、董明爽四个下放的体育教员和国民经济教研室下放的一个助教曾绍伦。他们五人身材魁梧体格结实，又都在一个生产小组里。刨白薯、挖渠、浇地等重活儿不但都能干，而且干的很好。这五个人又都是运动员，休息的时间经常在一起打篮球，和附近一个学校的师生举行三次比赛，三次都赢了，“五虎将”的名字就这样在农民中间喊出来了。
    我们走进合作社的庄子，在庄前场上打玉米、扬花生的新农民，蜂踊而上地包围了崔耀先，争先恐后地向他报告生产成绩，有的自豪地对崔耀先说：你们刚才走的庄前的一条公路，就是我们新老农民昨天连夜在上冻前赶修出来的。崔耀先和其他一起同去的干部也情不自禁地拿起洋镐挖起土来了。我们去看了几十个生产小组，所有小组的生产成绩，不论男女，已经都能抵上一个中等的农民劳动了。男的每天都能得十二到十四个工分，女的也能得九个工分左右。
    中捷友好生产合作社的农民和干部们打心底里喜欢这些新农民，夸这些教师和干部把社当作家，全心全力地干活。清晨，老农民们还没有下地，这些新农民就已经在地里干起活来了，傍晚下工也是他们走在后头。他们不论什么活儿都肯干，填牛棚、挖猪粪，这些在知识分子们看来最脏的活也一样地干。
    在南营庄生产队里，老农民还在谈论着三个下放的教师参加打井的事。打井这项工作在老农民中间也是挑选体力好最能吃苦的人干的。最初生产队里只挑出了五个老农民，因此工作进展得不快。这些从来没有看到过挖井的讲师苏国衡、苏素清，马列主义教研室总支书记陆迅，再三要求生产队长让他们也参加这项工作，老农民们都耽心他们吃不了这个苦，可是他们下井后和老农民一样举起镐刨下土，接着就换锹来铲，一面保证不断地把土向井上送，一面又忙着排水下地。他们从井下爬上来时，全身都湿淋淋的。老农民看到他们照常又说又笑，心里很感动，正式吸收了他们参加挖井工作。
    老农民们还特别称赞人民大学经济系下放的一些干部对引水灌溉麦地工程的设计所提的建议。社里原先的渠道设计要毁掉四亩麦地，下放的经济教员何伟经过几次测量和研究，提出了一个既不增加渠道工程量，又可保留原有四亩麦地的方案。从此以后农民们就把何伟叫做“工程师”了。何伟在生产队里也的确成了工程师。九年前他曾经在冀中老解放区参加过大生产运动，懂得改旱地为水浇地的技术，而中捷友好合作社的农民搞水浇地今年还是头一回，他们就把何伟当成了顾问。
    老农民们喜爱新农民，而这些新农民也热爱老农民。他们在这短短的一个月共同劳动的日子里，已经结下了深厚的友情。新闻系下放的林培芝等四个女教师就和指导她们生产的女社员小队长刘玉兰被人称为五姐妹。白天刘玉兰教林培芝等人生产，晚上林培芝等人就教刘玉兰学文化。下放到这里的女教师和干部，现在几乎每人都当了老农民的文化教员。她们的教学方法称做“三不定”，不定时间、不定地点、不定人数。中午，我们乘新农民们午休的时间，到宿舍里去访问。工业经济系下放的十多个干部正围在一起拟制突击组的条例，见我们进来了，一位年青的首先指着他旁边的一位身材高大的人介绍给我们说：他原名齐升才，现在名叫“大旗”，是我们突击组的组长。后来我们了解了他们组织突击组的想法后，才理解了“大旗”这个称号实际上是这些新农民用来督促自己前进的一个代号。齐升才等人来到这个生产队后，就发现队里生产计划安排得不好，有些活儿没有按社的规定完成，他们一方面帮助生产队长安排计划，同时还把体力比较强的十多个人组织在一起进行抢收，有时晚上也加几小时班。齐升才每天完成的工作量又多又好，有一天就挖九洼胡萝卜，创造了这个农业社挖胡萝卜的新纪录。因此大家就推他当突击组长，并叫他“大旗”。齐升才在下放前是人民大学的数学教员，他出身在一个典型的知识分子家庭里，他的父亲从事英语教师工作已经三十多年，他的哥哥在当工程师，妹妹在做医生，而他的爱人也是做教员，一家人没有一个参加过体力劳动。齐升才对记者说，他来到了农村也就爱上了农村，他特别爱农民们纯朴勤劳的品质。前两天下雪，他们在屋里正感到冷，生产队长和农民送来玉米棒，并且亲自为他们把炕烧热，齐升才说：“这不正是‘雪里送炭’吗！和这样的人在一起我会学到许多东西。”我们在和这些新农民接触中间，发现他们多数人都在考虑着进一步的努力重点。我们在和新闻系下放的教师道别时，他们有些人带着玩笑地说：“一个月的劳动治好了我们的神经衰弱病，我们要进一步治好我们的思想病。”
