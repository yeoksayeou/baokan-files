    They Need Enthusiastic Care
    Ji Wei
    For regions where work is progressing well, leadership values them and praises them at every level. Higher-level responsible persons often visit, and problems are resolved quickly. News reporters visit frequently, and good points are discovered early. Is this right? Of course, it is.
    However, what attitude should higher-level leading organs and leaders adopt towards those regions where objective conditions are relatively difficult, subjective forces are relatively weak, and work progress is relatively slow? There are still some issues worth studying in this regard.
    The development of any of our work is unbalanced. There are relatively strong and good links, and there are also relatively weak and poor links. The units, departments, and regions that first reach advanced standards in work are always a minority, but when the majority has been raised to the advanced level, there will inevitably be even more advanced outstanding individuals in between. Grasping advanced links and driving weak links is a method of leadership work that we often use. However, judging from the situation in many places, the work of grasping advanced links is done relatively well, while how to drive weak links is done relatively poorly. Often it is left to drift, with the assumption that as long as advanced links are grasped, weak links will all be driven automatically. The actual situation is not like this.
    Some leading organs and leading comrades, because they only pay attention to grasping advanced links, even further weaken their leadership of weak links in practice. Responsible comrades and general working comrades of higher-level leading organs rarely go to these regions, and the typical pilot projects of many tasks are often not carried out in these regions. Even more harmful is that their special circumstances are not noted, their experiences are not valued, and some leading organs often only base their decisions on the situation of a few advanced links when formulating specific policies and determining work arrangements. News reporters also rarely go to these regions, and the newspapers of various levels of Party organizations rarely reflect their actual activities. There is indeed a bad cycle here: because their work development is relatively poor, it has not attracted the attention of the leadership, as a result, the true situation is not reflected, and good models and good experiences are not praised and promoted; difficulties and problems are not discovered and resolved in a timely manner; most importantly, the masses and cadres here feel that the leading organs care too little about them, which cannot but affect their enthusiasm.
    Has the leadership really completely forgotten about them? Of course not. It can only be said that the care is relatively insufficient. And another bad practice often offsets that part of the relatively weak care, which is that some leading organs and leading comrades, when issuing calls, giving instructions, and summarizing work, criticize these regions more than they encourage them, do not notice their achievements, and emphasize their shortcomings more heavily. Higher-level leading comrades are not completely absent from these regions, but as one provincial Party committee responsible comrade said in self-criticism: "I attend almost every meeting I go to, and I criticize in almost every meeting." And the newspapers of the leading organs, not only report less about these regions, but also tend to "report the bad news and not the good news." As a result, some of the masses and cadres in these regions naturally feel indignant, and some cadres who go to higher levels for meetings are said to be "not in high spirits and unable to hold their heads high." Of course, the feelings of these comrades are also a bit fragile, but how can we mainly blame them!
    Criticism and self-criticism are naturally the most important weapon in our Party's life. The issue is not whether it is important, but how to use it correctly. For a region where work progress is relatively poor, the leader should mainly encourage them, not criticize them. Encourage them to overcome difficulties and correct shortcomings with full confidence, and encourage them to improve themselves and their work in the course of continuous progress. If, when their work progress is poor and they are feeling heavy-hearted, the leadership does not encourage them but only criticizes them, or if criticism is not carried out under the premise of encouragement, it will further dampen their enthusiasm and confidence.
    It should also be seen that in a region where work progress is relatively poor, the work situation is also unbalanced. Their work is not poor everywhere, and not everything is poor. In such regions, there are also very prominent and advanced departments and units, very good achievements, and very outstanding figures. Leaders should help them discover and summarize these model things in a timely manner with full enthusiasm, and use these vivid and concrete examples to encourage them. Using this kind of locally grown good model to promote the work of this region is more convincing and more practical than using good models from other regions. Most valuable of all, it gives the people and cadres of this region enthusiastic encouragement.
    Some news workers believe that such regions have relatively poor work, so there is nothing worth reporting, which is a superficial argument that does not go deep into reality. In fact, in such regions, thousands of brave and hardworking people are still constantly creating miracles, and hundreds and thousands of cadres, especially grassroots cadres, are also working hard day and night. There are also great heroes and outstanding models there, but they have not received the attention they deserve. Some news workers say that the bad is the majority here, and the good is the minority, and the best models are only scattered sparks, so they believe that the work here is not worth praising. At this time, these comrades have forgotten the principle that "a single spark can start a prairie fire." The responsibility of news workers is to be good at discovering these sparks, and to enthusiastically fan the flames and add firewood to help the fire grow and expand its burning range. The most valuable sense of fresh things for news workers is manifested in these places.
    Newspapers need a method of propaganda that contrasts good and bad, and it is natural to have a great educational effect to compare good models in regions where work is good with bad models in regions where work is poor, but we cannot be limited to this kind of comparison. We can also find a poorly performing model in a region where work is good to compare with its good model. In this way, there will naturally be an educational effect on poor regions, and there will also be a warning effect on good regions. We can also go to a region where work is poor to find an outstanding good model to compare with its poor model. In this way, there will naturally be an encouraging effect on poor regions, and there will also be an educational significance for good regions. It should be seen that there are still bad models in regions where work is generally done well. This bad model is particularly worth reminding, and it is indispensable for consolidating and improving the excellent achievements of regions where work is good. And in regions where work is generally not done well, the good models here are even more valuable, which not only encourages the masses and cadres in this region, gives them an example of how to do a good job, and gives them the driving force to reverse the disadvantage, but also shows the incomparable superiority of our socialist system to the people of the whole country, that any region with relatively poor work has the hope of greatly improving and the possibility of rapid progress. As a powerful weapon for propaganda and agitation, the newspaper should do everything possible to add fuel to socialist construction and should not play the role of pouring cold water in practice.
    Is there no need to criticize regions where work is relatively poor? Of course not. Serious mistakes should naturally be criticized, and general shortcomings also need to be criticized. It's just that here, there is a greater need for constructive criticism with analysis and methods, and there is no need for simple accusations, and of course, we are even more opposed to scolding that hurts the self-esteem of the masses and cadres. Since the leading comrades of higher-level leading organs are more capable than the comrades of lower-level organs, their responsibility is not only to be able to more sharply discover the shortcomings and mistakes in the work, but more importantly to correctly analyze these shortcomings and mistakes, find out their causes, see their harm, and study how to overcome these shortcomings and improve these mistakes. Only in this way can we help lower-level comrades to be better at discovering, analyzing, and correcting shortcomings, can we train and improve cadres in criticism and self-criticism, and can we cultivate and enhance the confidence and ability of lower-level cadres to work independently. Leading comrades with bureaucratic problems like to accuse and scold everywhere, as if this were their main responsibility. In fact, discovering shortcomings and mistakes is relatively easy, and it is even easier to accuse and scold, which only requires pointing fingers and talking, while analyzing shortcomings and correcting shortcomings requires a lot of careful and arduous practical work.
    Leading comrades should have a style of thinking for lower-level cadres from their perspective. What are the reasons why a region's work is relatively poor? Are so many lower-level cadres all irresponsible in their work? Are they all people who are incapable and incompetent? The fact will never be like that. We must think for them from their perspective, understand their objective difficulties, and understand their subjective weaknesses. If we see their difficulties, we must seriously regard them as our own difficulties. If we discover their shortcomings and mistakes, we must regard them as our own shortcomings and mistakes, and treat their problems as our own problems, so that we have the same sense of responsibility as lower-level cadres to solve these problems. Before criticizing them, first think about how to solve them ourselves, first discuss with the cadres how to solve them, and first help the cadres to go to the masses to study how to solve them. Finding a solution and proposing a solution at the same time when criticizing can have a great positive effect on helping cadres understand and correct shortcomings and mistakes. It also improves the cadres' working ability and encourages their confidence in improving their work.
    Finally, there is also the problem of terminology that is worth noting. Some comrades regard regions where work is relatively poor as "backward regions" or call them "backward regions." This black hat must be removed. There is, of course, a simple problem of inappropriate wording here, but this also reflects an inappropriate or incorrect idea. Advanced and backward are two opposite adjectives, one is advancing, and the other is retreating. Backward is certainly not advanced, but not advanced does not mean that they are all backward. Everyone is working hard together on the socialist road. One is progressing quickly, and the other is progressing slowly. How can we call those who are progressing relatively slowly backward? Before the work of transforming backward villages, some villages had not overthrown landlords and rich peasants, had not eliminated counter-revolutionaries, the leadership was in the hands of bad people, and the masses' class consciousness had not been raised. At that time, it was accurate and appropriate to call such villages backward villages. But for regions with general shortcomings in their work and relatively slow work progress, it is okay to say that a certain place, a certain department, or a certain task is indeed backward, or that a certain cadre is indeed backward. But if we generally call the entire region a "backward region," that is very wrong. This black hat is a great mental pressure on the local masses and cadres, and it will indeed make some people feel embarrassed to raise their heads in front of others. What is particularly intolerable is that some people regard or call our country's remote areas and mountainous areas "backward regions." This is a reflection of the wrong idea of ​​underestimating remote areas and mountainous areas. It should be admitted that the objective conditions in remote areas and mountainous areas are relatively difficult, the wounds left by the old society are relatively tragic, the foundation for economic development and cultural development is relatively weak, and at the same time, because they are far away from the higher-level leading organs and generally receive less specific leadership, the work progress in many regions is indeed relatively slow. However, the cadres and people there are carrying out various constructions so heroically and tenaciously, the face of that area has already undergone very significant changes, and they have also created many brilliant examples. The achievements there cannot be underestimated, and the work there should not be taken lightly.
    In regions where work progress is relatively poor, the broad masses and cadres are by no means willing to continue to be poor. They are working hard and competing with other regions in secret. They need enthusiastic care and greater help. The masses and cadres there hope that leading comrades will go to their place more, hope that work teams will go, hope that cadres who are transferred to lower levels will go, hope that various workers will go, hope that scientists will go, hope that writers will go, and of course, also hope that news reporters will go!

    他们需要热情的关怀
    季委
    对于工作进展很好的地区，领导重视，层层表扬。上级负责人常常去，有问题解决得快。新闻记者去得多，有优点发现得早。这应不应该呢？当然应该。
    但是，对于那些客观条件比较困难、主观力量比较薄弱、工作进展比较迟缓的地区，上级领导机关和领导人员应该采取什么态度呢？在这方面还有一些值得研究的问题。
    我们任何工作的发展情况，都是不大平衡的，有较强较好的环节，也有较弱较差的环节。在工作中首先达到先进标准的单位、部门和地区，总是少数，但是等到大多数提高到先进水平时，这中间一定又会出现更先进的杰出者。抓先进的环节、带动薄弱的环节，这是我们经常运用的一种领导工作的方法。但是从好些地方的情况来看，抓先进环节的工作作得比较好，如何去带动薄弱的环节，就作得比较差劲。常常是自流的，以为只要抓了先进环节，薄弱环节就会通通自动地带动起来。实际情况并不是这样。
    有些地区的领导机关和领导同志由于只注意抓先进环节，甚至在事实上更加削弱了对薄弱环节的领导。上级领导机关的负责同志和一般工作同志很少去这些地区，很多工作的典型试办常常不在这些地区。更有害的，是他们的特殊情况未被注意，他们的经验未被重视，一些领导机关在制订具体政策和确定工作部署时，常常只根据少数先进环节的情况。新闻记者也很少去这些地区，各级党组织的机关报很少反映他们的实际活动。这里确实存在一种不好的循环：由于他们工作发展比较差，没有引起领导的重视，结果，真实情况反映不上去，好典型好经验，得不到表扬和提高；有困难有毛病，也得不到及时的发现和解决；最主要是这里的群众和干部感到领导机关对他们的关怀太少，这不能不是影响干劲的一个原因。
    领导上是不是真地完全忘掉了他们呢？当然不是。只能说是相对地关怀得不够。而另一种不好的作法，又常常抵消了那一部分比较微弱的关怀，就是有些领导机关和领导同志在发号召、下指示和总结工作的时候，对这些地区批评多于鼓励，对他们的成绩没有看上眼，对他们的缺点又强调得重了一些。上级领导同志也不是完全没有到他们那里去，但是正如一位省委负责同志自我检讨时所说的：“我去了差不多有会就参加，也差不多有会就批评。”而领导机关的机关报，对这些地区不只报道少，而且差不多又偏向于“报忧不报喜”。这样一来，这些地区的群众和干部自然有些人愤愤不平，有的干部到上级去开会，据说也“情绪不高、抬不起头”。当然，这些同志的感情也脆弱了一点，但是我们怎能主要去责怪他们呢！
    批评和自我批评自然是我们党的生活中一个最主要的武器。问题不在它重不重要，而在如何正确地使用它。对于一个工作进展比较差的地区，领导者对它们主要应该是鼓励，而不是批评。鼓励他们信心百倍地去克服困难纠正缺点，鼓励他们在不断前进中提高自己和改进工作。如果当他们工作进展较差、心情沉重的时候，领导上不鼓励只批评，或者不是在鼓励的前提下进行批评，就会更加挫伤他们的积极性和自信心。
    还应该看到，一个工作进展较差的地区，工作情况也是不平衡的，他们的工作并不是处处都差、一切都差，在这类地区也有很突出很先进的部门和单位，也有很优良的成绩，也有很卓越的人物。领导者应该抱着满腔热情去帮助他们及时发现和总结这些模范事物，用这些生动具体事例去鼓励他们。在薄弱环节里去找先进的因素，去找一切积极的因素，用本地区这种土生土长的好典型来推动这个地区的工作，比用其他地区的好典型，就更有说服力、更有实际意义。最可贵的，是它给了这个地区人民和干部以热情的鼓舞。
    有的新闻工作同志，认为这样的地区，工作比较差，就没有什么值得报道的东西，这是不深入实际的肤浅的论断。实际上就在这样的地区，千千万万勇敢而勤劳的人民群众，同样在不断地创造着奇迹，成千成百的干部特别是基层干部同样在废寝忘餐地努力工作，那里同样有伟大的英雄、有出色的模范，只是没有受到应有的重视。有的新闻工作同志说，这里差的是多数，好的是少数，最好的典型只是星星点点，因而认为这里的工作值不得表扬。这些同志在这时忘掉了“星星之火可以燎原”的道理。新闻工作人员的责任，就是应该善于去发现这些星星之火，应该热情蓬勃地去为它煽风加柴，助长它的火势，扩大它的燃烧范围。新闻工作人员最可贵的新鲜事物的感觉正表现在这些地方。
    报纸需要好坏对比的宣传方法，用工作好的地区的好典型和工作差的地区的不好的典型来进行对比，自然有很大的教育作用，但是，我们不能只限于这种对比。我们还可以在一个工作好的地区里去找一个工作不好的典型来和它的好典型相对比。这样，对差的地区自然有教育作用，对好的地区也有警惕作用。也可以到工作差的地区去找一个突出的好典型来和它的不好典型相比较。这样，对差的地区自然有鼓舞作用，对好的地区也有教育意义。应该看到，在工作普遍作得好的地区仍然有不好典型，这个不好典型，特别值得提醒，这对巩固和提高工作好的地区的优良成绩，决不可缺少。而在工作普遍作得不大好的地区，这里的好典型也就显得更加可贵，这不只鼓舞这个地区的群众和干部，给他们以作好工作的榜样，给他们以扭转劣势的动力，而且也向全国人民表明我们社会主义制度的无比的优越性，任何一个工作比较差的地区都有大大改善的希望，都有飞速跃进的可能。作为宣传鼓动的有力武器的报纸，应该千方百计地为社会主义建设加油，不应该在实际上起着泼冷水的作用。
    是不是对于工作比较差的地区就不需要进行批评呢？当然不是。严重的错误自然应该批评，一般性的缺点也需要批评。只是在这里更需要有分析有办法的建设性的批评，不需要单纯的指责，当然更反对那种伤害群众和干部自尊心的训斥。上级领导机关的领导同志既然比下级机关的同志水准高，他们的责任就不只限于能够更锐敏地发现工作中的缺点和错误，更重要是要正确地去分析这些缺点和错误，找出它们的产生原因，看出它们的危害性，而且研究出如何克服这些缺点和改进这些错误的办法。只有这样，才能帮助下级同志更善于发现、分析和改正缺点，才能在批评和自我批评中锻炼干部和提高干部，才能培养和增强下级干部独立工作的信心和能力。有官僚主义毛病的领导同志，喜欢到处指责到处训斥，好像这就是他们的主要责任一样。其实，发现缺点和错误，这是比较容易的事，指责和训斥一番更是容易，这只要指手划脚说说就行，而分析缺点和改正缺点，就需要作很多细致而艰苦的实际工作。
    领导同志应该有一种设身处地为下级干部设想的作风。一个地区的工作作得比较差究竟是什么原因？难道那样多的下级干部都是工作不负责任吗？难道他们都是能力很差不能胜任的人吗？事实决不会是那样。必须设身处地地去为他们想想，了解他们客观上的困难，了解他们主观上的弱点。看见他们的困难，就要认真当成自己的困难。发现他们的缺点和错误，就要看成是自己的缺点和错误，把他们的问题作为自己的问题，使自己具有下级干部那种必须解决这些问题的责任心。在批评他们以前，先自己想想如何解决，先和干部研究如何解决，先帮助干部到群众中去研究如何解决，找到了解决的办法，在批评的时候同时提出解决的办法，这对帮助干部认识和改正缺点错误都有很大的积极作用。而且提高了干部的工作能力，鼓舞了他们改进工作的信心。
    最后，还有一个名词用语的问题也值得注意。有的同志把工作作得比较差的地区看成“落后地区”或者叫成“落后地区”，这顶黑帽子是必须摘掉的。这里当然有单纯的用词不当的问题，但是这中间也反映了一种不妥当的或者不正确的思想。先进和落后是两个相反的形容词，一个前进，一个后退。落后的当然不是先进的，但是，不是先进的不等于都是落后的。大家一同在社会主义的大道上努力前进，一个进步得快，一个进步得慢，怎能把进步得比较慢的叫成落后的呢？在改造落后乡的工作以前，有些乡村，地主、富农没有打倒，反革命分子没有肃清，领导权掌握在坏人手里，群众的阶级觉悟没有提高，那时，把这样的乡叫做落后乡，那是确切恰当的。但是对于工作中有一般性的缺点、工作进展比较慢的地区，说他们某一个地方某一个部门的某一项工作确实落后了，或者某一个干部确实落后了，是可以的，如果笼统地把整个地区也叫作“落后地区”，那就很不对头了。这顶黑帽子对当地群众和干部是很大的精神压力，确实会压得有些人不好意思在人面前抬起头来。特别不能容忍的，是有的人把我们祖国的边远地区和山区看成或者叫成“落后地区”，这是轻视边远地区和山区的错误思想的反映。应该承认，边远地区和山区的客观条件是比较困难的，旧社会给那里遗留下来的创伤是比较惨重的，经济发展和文化发展的基础是比较微弱的，同时，由于那里离开上级领导机关比较远、得到的具体领导一般说来也比较少，因而不少地区的工作进展确实比较迟缓。但是那里的干部和人民是那样英勇顽强地进行着各种建设，那里的面貌已经有很显著的改变，那里同样创造了很多光辉的范例，那里的成就不能低估，那里的工作不容许轻视。
    在工作进展比较差的地区，广大的群众和干部决不甘心继续差下去，他们正在下狠心地努力，正在暗地里和其他地区竞赛。他们需要热情关怀，需要更大的帮助。那里的群众和干部希望领导同志多去他们那里，希望工作组去，希望下放干部去，希望各种工作者去，希望科学家去，希望文学家去，当然，也希望新闻记者去！
