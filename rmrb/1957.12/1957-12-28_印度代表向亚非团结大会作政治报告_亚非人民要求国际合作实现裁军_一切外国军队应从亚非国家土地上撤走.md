Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 26th: During the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, on the afternoon of the 26th, Indian representative Dr. Anup Singh delivered a political report on the international situation at the plenary session, stating that the Asian-African Solidarity Conference should become a Bandung Conference for the people.

He also said that the cessation of nuclear weapons testing is "an indispensable prerequisite for achieving any further agreement on the major issue of disarmament." He said: "We support all initiatives to launch mass actions for disarmament and international cooperation through any effective means, which will create an atmosphere for any early formal world disarmament conference."

The Indian parliamentarian, in his political report, recalled that the revival and awareness of a common destiny led the leaders of Asian-African countries to gather in Bandung two and a half years ago, and that conference achieved astonishing unity. He said: "We are meeting once again on an unofficial basis to further strengthen our solidarity."

Singh said that imperialists are unwilling to see the Asian-African people gain freedom. "We, the people of Asia and Africa, are absolutely unwilling to lose our hard-won freedom."

Dr. Singh paid tribute to the patriotic warriors and martyrs of Egypt who sacrificed their lives for the freedom and glorious existence of their compatriots. He also congratulated the newly independent countries – Ghana, Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia, and Malaya – and wished success to the upcoming official conference of independent African states.

Speaking of the threat of nuclear weapons, Singh said: "We, the people of Asia and Africa, are deeply concerned about the terrible threat of nuclear weapons, because our Japanese compatriots were the first victims of these weapons."

"We are disturbed by the implications of the agenda of the recent NATO conference, which suggested the establishment of missile bases in NATO countries. This practice will undoubtedly involve some of our countries through interconnected military treaties such as the Baghdad Pact and SEATO."

"We oppose the idea that anyone has the right to destroy any ideology by force. They must compete with each other in the free realm of thought, and each can win hearts and minds through demonstration and persuasion."

When talking about foreign interference in the internal affairs of other countries, Singh cited the Eisenhower Doctrine as an example. He said that even if some Arab governments have not rejected it, it is clear that the people of Arab countries have rejected the Eisenhower Doctrine.

He stated: "The recent threats to the independence and integrity of Syria have further confirmed the suspicions of the Arab people that foreign interference constitutes the most serious danger facing nations and peoples."

Singh demanded that "all Asian-African countries withdraw from military treaties and military alliances concluded with foreign countries," demanded the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the dismantling of all foreign bases from Asian-African territories, and urged all Asian-African countries to strive for closer cooperation with their neighbors.

He refuted the so-called filling of a power vacuum. He said that if there is any vacuum to be filled, it can only be filled by the combined capacity and strength of the people of this region.

Speaking of the issue of colonies and trust territories, Singh expressed support for the people of all those regions still under colonial rule. He said: "We believe that the struggle for freedom anywhere in Asia and Africa is our own struggle."

Singh condemned the atrocities of France in Algeria and suggested that France and Algeria immediately hold negotiations on the basis of unconditional recognition of Algeria's complete independence.

He protested against the attitude of certain trusteeship countries that have consistently failed to abide by their solemn obligations to the United Nations Charter.

He said: "The shameful chapter of domination and exploitation must end, and it must end now."

Singh expressed deep concern about the situation facing the Indonesian people, saying, "This conference fully supports Indonesia's claim (to West Irian), considering this claim to be justified historically, constitutionally, and geographically, and calls on the Dutch government to immediately and unconditionally recognize this claim."

Singh denounced racial discrimination, saying that the Asian-African people "can no longer tolerate" this abhorrent system of complete disregard and flagrant violation of United Nations resolutions.

Speaking of discrimination and inequality in the United Nations, Singh said: "It is shocking that the great People's Republic of China, which has the support and endorsement of 600 million people, is still not represented in the United Nations. To continue to recognize Chiang Kai-shek as the spokesman of China is a great mockery and insult to the common sense of the member states of the United Nations." "We are fully convinced that no major international issue, especially those related to the Far East, can be resolved without the active participation of the People's Republic of China."

"The abnormal situation in Taiwan, an inseparable part of Chinese territory, must be changed and ended immediately."

He also urged the United Nations to actively consider the urgent issue of the peaceful reunification of Korea and Vietnam.

Singh concluded by calling on the Asian-African people to strengthen the spirit of solidarity among them, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference.

    印度代表向亚非团结大会作政治报告
    亚非人民要求国际合作实现裁军
    一切外国军队应从亚非国家土地上撤走
    据新华社开罗26日电　印度代表阿努普·辛格博士26日下午在亚非团结大会全体会议上作环顾国际局势的政治报告时说，让亚非团结大会成为人民的万隆会议。
    他还说，停止核武器试验是“就巨大的裁军问题取得任何进一步协议的不可缺少的先决条件”。他说：“我们支持通过任何有效办法为裁军及国际合作发动群众行动的一切倡议，这种行动将为任何及早举行的正式的世界裁军会议创造气氛。”
    这位印度议员在他的政治报告中回顾说，复兴以及对共同命运的认识，使亚非国家的领袖们在两年半以前在万隆聚集一堂，那次会议达到了惊人的一致。他说：“我们在非官方的基础上又一次举行会议，以求进一步加强我们的团结一致。”
    辛格说，帝国主义者对于亚非人民获得自由是不心甘情愿的。“我们亚非两洲人民决不愿失去我们的得之不易的自由”。
    辛格博士对埃及的爱国志士和烈士表示敬意，因为他们为他们同胞的自由和光荣的生存献出了自己的生命。他还对新近获得独立的一些国家——加纳、苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯和马来亚——表示祝贺，并且预祝即将举行的非洲独立国家的官方会议获得成功。
    谈到核武器的威胁，辛格说：“我们亚非两洲人民对于核武器的可怕的威胁深感忧虑，因为在这种武器下的第一个遭难者是我们的日本同胞。”
    “我们对于最近北大西洋公约组织会议议程所包含的意义感到不安，因为那个会议上建议在北大西洋公约组织国家内建立导弹基地，这种作法无疑会通过巴格达条约、东南亚条约组织之类互有联系的军事条约而牵涉到我们的一些国家。”
    “我们反对所谓任何人有权用武力摧毁任何意识形态的想法。他们必须在思想的自由领域内互相竞赛，每个人可以用示范和说服的方式来赢得人心和忠诚。”
    辛格在谈到外国干涉其它国家内政时举艾森豪威尔主义为例。他说，如果说有的阿拉伯国家政府没有拒绝的话，那么显然阿拉伯国家的人民已经拒绝了艾森豪威尔主义。
    他说：“最近对叙利亚的独立和完整的威胁已经进一步证实了阿拉伯人民的猜疑，那就是，外来的干涉构成了国家和人民所面临的最严重的危险。”
    辛格要求“所有的亚非国家退出同外国缔结的军事条约和军事联盟”，要求从亚非国家土地上撤走一切外国军队和撤除一切外国基地，并且请所有亚非国家为寻求与它们的邻国作更密切的合作而努力。
    他驳斥了所谓填补力量真空的说法。他说，如果有任何要填补的真空的话，也只能由这个地区的人民联合的能力和实力来填补。
    谈到殖民地和托管地的问题时，辛格对于所有那些仍然在殖民统治下的地区的人民表示支持。他说：“我们认为亚非任何地方争取自由的斗争就是我们自己的斗争”。
    辛格谴责法国在阿尔及利亚的暴行，并且建议法国和阿尔及利亚在无条件地承认阿尔及利亚完全独立的基础上立即举行谈判。
    他抗议某些一向不遵守它们对联合国宪章庄严的义务的托管国的态度。
    他说：“统治和剥削的可耻的一章必须结束，而且就在现在结束。”
    辛格对印度尼西亚人民面临的局势表示深切的关怀，他说，“这次大会完全支持印度尼西亚（对西伊里安）的要求，认为这一要求在历史上、宪法上和地理上都是正当的，并且呼吁荷兰政府立刻无条件地承认这一要求。”
    辛格指责种族歧视，他说，对于这种完全漠视和公然违背联合国决定的可恶的制度，“亚非人民是不能再容忍了。”
    辛格在谈到联合国的歧视和不平等时说：“得到六亿人民支持和拥护的伟大的中华人民共和国仍然没有代表出席联合国，这种情况是令人吃惊的。如果继续承认蒋介石是中国的发言人的话，那是对联合国成员国的常识的极大的嘲笑和侮辱。”“我们完全相信，如果没有中华人民共和国积极参加的话，任何重要的国际问题，尤其是那些和远东有关的问题，都不可能得到解决。”
    “中国领土不可分割的一部分台湾的反常的情况必须立即改变和结束。”
    他还吁请联合国积极地考虑和平地重新统一朝鲜和越南的迫切问题。
    辛格最后要求亚非人民加强他们之间建立在和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则的基础上的团结精神。
