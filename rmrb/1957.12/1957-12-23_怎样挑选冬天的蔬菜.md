How to Choose Vegetables in Winter
Sun Yulan

When the weather is hot, people like to eat light food; in winter, they like to eat more greasy foods and meats. Why is this? Because in winter, the body needs to produce more heat to supply consumption. However, this is only the body's natural adaptation and cannot completely solve the nutritional problems of the winter diet.

In winter, there is a lack of vegetables, especially green leafy vegetables, and even less in cold regions. Vegetables are the main source of vitamins and minerals. During the long winter days, the north mainly relies on Chinese cabbage as the primary vegetable. It has a delicious taste, delicate texture, and is inexpensive, so many people like to eat it. However, Chinese cabbage contains very little Vitamin A and minerals (green-mouthed cabbage contains more than white-mouthed cabbage). Grains and meats also have very low Vitamin A content. Therefore, if you do not pay attention to this issue when choosing food, you may experience a Vitamin A deficiency.

However, some vegetables in winter contain more Vitamin A and are not expensive, such as rapeseed, pak choi, and spinach, which are very high in vitamins and minerals. Carrots have a Vitamin A content comparable to green leafy vegetables, and they are produced in large quantities in cold regions, so they should be recommended for consumption. Pickled mustard greens are also comparable to green leafy vegetables. Pickled mustard greens still contain very high levels of Vitamin A and are particularly rich in calcium, ten times that of Chinese cabbage, so their consumption should also be encouraged. In addition, sweet potatoes are also a cheap and good-quality winter food. They contain a considerable amount of Vitamin A and Vitamin C, especially red-fleshed sweet potatoes, which contain even more. If you eat half a catty of yellow-fleshed sweet potatoes or two to three ounces of red-fleshed sweet potatoes every day, you can supply the daily requirement of Vitamin A and Vitamin C. The mineral content of sweet potatoes is about the same as that of ordinary vegetables. If you use sweet potatoes to replace a portion of grains, consumed in a ratio of three to one, you will not only supply the vitamins lacking in grains but also increase the supply of minerals.

Vegetables are best when they are fresh. However, sometimes supply is difficult in some places, so some must be stored for future use. The storage temperature is very important. Too cold, and they will freeze and spoil; too high a temperature, and they will easily wither or rot, which affects the vitamin content. Spinach stored at a room temperature of 16℃ to 26℃ will lose up to 84% of its Vitamin C and 24% of its Vitamin A after three days. At 0℃ to 2℃, the loss is very small. Vegetables should also avoid direct sunlight exposure, to prevent oxidation and ultraviolet radiation from destroying the vitamins. Therefore, vegetables should be stored in a cool, ventilated, and low-temperature place.

Cooking methods and pre- and post-cooking handling can also affect the vitamin and mineral content of vegetables. The vegetable pieces should not be cut too small, and they should not be soaked in water for too long after cutting. Blanching vegetables in water results in a loss of both vitamins and minerals. It is best to directly stir-fry raw vegetables in hot oil. When eating cold dishes, be sure to boil the water before adding the vegetables. Stir-frying with the lid off is not a good method, as it will destroy 50% of Vitamin C and 10%-30% of Vitamin A. If you add a lid to the pot to isolate the air and reduce oxidation, you can reduce some of the loss.

Vegetables should be stir-fried and eaten immediately. Do not keep cooked vegetables warm on the stove or in a warming box, and do not reheat them, as this will result in a greater loss of nutrients. Stir-fried Chinese cabbage, if kept warm in the pot for fifteen minutes, will lose about 25% of its Vitamin C; if kept warm for thirty minutes, it will lose 40%.

Although winter is a season of vegetable shortages, if we pay attention to selection, storage, cooking, and insulation, we can still ensure that we get the necessary nutrition.

    怎样挑选冬天的蔬菜
    孙毓兰
    在天气热的时候，人们都喜欢吃些清淡食品；在冬天就喜欢多吃些油腻和肉类。这是什么原故呢？因为冬天需要身体多产生一些热能来供给消耗。但这只是身体的自然适应，不能完全解决冬季膳食的营养问题。
    冬天蔬菜缺乏，绿叶菜少，在寒冷地带更少。而蔬菜是维生素和无机盐的主要来源。在漫长的冬日里，北方是以大白菜为主要的蔬菜。它的味道鲜美，质地细嫩，价格便宜，人多喜欢吃。但大白菜的甲种维生素和无机盐含量都很少（青口白菜比白口白菜含量较多）。五谷和肉类的甲种维生素含量也都很低。因此，在选择食物的时候，如果不注意这个问题，可能产生甲种维生素缺乏的现象。
    但是，冬天也有些菜蔬里所含甲种维生素较多，价钱也不贵，如油菜、瓢菜、菠菜等，维生素和无机盐含量都很高。葫萝卜的甲种维生素含量同绿叶蔬菜不相上下，在寒冷地方它的产量较多，是应当推荐多食用的。还有雪里红也可同绿叶蔬菜相比。腌过的雪里红仍含有很高的甲种维生素，含的钙质也特别丰富，有大白菜的十倍，也是应当提倡食用的。另外甜薯也是一种价廉物美的冬季食品。它含有相当量的甲种维生素和丙种维生素，尤其是红心甜薯含量更高。假若每天食用半斤黄心甜薯或二三两红心甜薯，即可供给一天所需的甲、丙两种维生素。甜薯所含的无机盐也和一般的蔬菜差不多。若用甜薯代替一部分粮食，按三比一食用，则不仅供给了五谷中缺少的维生素，同时还可以增加无机盐的供应量。
    蔬菜是愈新鲜愈好。但有时有些地方供应困难，不得不贮藏一些备用。保存的温度很重要。太冷了会结冰冻坏；温度高了容易萎缩或腐烂，都影响维生素的含量。菠菜贮于室温16℃到26℃的地方，三天后，丙种维生素损失可达84％，甲种维生素损失达24％。在0℃到2℃时则损失甚少。蔬菜还要避免日光直接曝晒，以免氧化和紫外线照射对维生素所起的破坏作用。因此蔬菜应当贮存在阴凉通风和温度较低的地方。
    烹调方法和烹调前后的处理也会影响蔬菜中维生素和无机盐的含量。菜块不宜切得太小，切后也不要在水中浸泡过久。水中抄菜是对维生素和无机盐都有损失的，最好把生菜直接放在热油锅里炒熟。如吃凉拌菜时，一定要把水煮开后再放蔬菜。开锅炒菜的方法不好，这样会破坏丙种维生素50％，甲种维生素10％—30％。如加上锅盖，隔绝空气，减少氧化作用，则可减少一部分损失。
    蔬菜要现炒现吃，炒熟后不要放在炉台或暖箱中温热，也不要回锅重温，那样会损失较多的营养素。炒好的大白菜，如在锅中温热十五分钟，丙种维生素就可损失25％左右；温热三十分钟，就会损失40％。
    冬天虽然是蔬菜缺乏季节，如果我们注意选用、保存、烹调及保温等方面，必需的营养还是可以得到保证的。
