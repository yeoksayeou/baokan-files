Xinhua News Agency, December 16th -- Foreign envoys to China, who recently returned to Beijing from trips to other parts of the country, hosted a banquet in Beijing on the evening of the 16th to thank the Chinese Foreign Ministry for organizing the trip for them.

Polish Ambassador to China, Kirilo, delivered a speech on behalf of the foreign envoys at the banquet, saying that they saw the great achievements China had made in developing industry, agriculture, and culture during the trip. The newly built Yangtze River Bridge is a symbol of the great strength and will of the Chinese people. He said, "This trip will undoubtedly help us better understand the tremendous changes taking place in China, and will also enable us to better understand the policy of the government of the People's Republic of China to seek peaceful cooperation with the people of all countries in the world."

Kirilo wished the Chinese government and people further brilliant achievements in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects, and further development and strengthening of friendly cooperation with all countries.

Vice Foreign Ministers Zhang Wentian, Zhang Hanfu, Zeng Yongquan, and responsible persons from relevant departments were invited to attend this evening's banquet. Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Wentian said at the banquet that he was pleased to see that this trip had helped the foreign envoys and diplomatic officials to further understand China. He said, "Mutual understanding between countries is very important for enhancing friendship between countries."

Zhang Wentian raised a glass to the friendly cooperation between the people of all countries and to world peace.

A dance was held after the banquet.
