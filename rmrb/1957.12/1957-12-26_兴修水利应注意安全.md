    Safety Should Be Emphasized in Water Conservancy Construction
    A massive campaign to build farmland water conservancy projects is currently underway in the vast rural areas. However, some areas have neglected safety education for cadres and laborers during this campaign. For example, at the Xishan Reservoir in the Second District of Chongren County, Jiangxi Province, a serious accident involving casualties occurred due to a lack of attention to safety and violations of operating procedures during the excavation of hollow soil, resulting in the deaths of two laborers and serious injuries to one. In An'yuan Agricultural Cooperative of Gu'cheng Township, Nanfeng County, a woman was also crushed to death due to the excavation of hollow soil during water conservancy construction. In Le'an County, during the construction of the Shiliyuan Reservoir, laborer Tian Shuisheng had his leg bone crushed by a stone while digging tree roots on a slope due to neglecting safe operations.
    As the nationwide campaign to build farmland water conservancy projects is currently in full swing, in order to prevent and avoid personal injury accidents, it is recommended that all regions pay constant attention to strengthening safety education for cadres and laborers.

    兴修水利应注意安全
    目前广大农村正开展声势浩大的兴修农田水利的运动。但是在运动中，有些地区忽视了对干部和民工的安全教育。如江西省崇仁县二区溪山水库，由于不注意安全，违反操作规程，在挖空心土的时候，发生了严重的伤亡事故，压死民工二人，重伤一人。南丰县古城乡安沅农业社在修水利中也因挖空心土压死妇女一人。乐安县在修石里沅水库中，因忽视安全操作，在坡上挖树根时，民工田水生被石块压碎腿骨。
    当前全国各地兴修农田水利运动正在深入开展，为了防止和避免人身伤亡事故的发生，建议各地应经常注意加强对干部和民工的安全教育。
