　　Vigorously Launch the Winter Patriotic Health Campaign

　　With the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) and the issuance of the Party's Third Plenary Session's instructions on actively carrying out health campaigns, Party committees and governments at the provincial and municipal levels are summarizing the experiences of past health campaigns and formulating health campaign plans in accordance with local conditions. They are also actively seizing the favorable opportunity of winter to launch a large-scale winter patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests.

　　In the past few years, thanks to the efforts of the people across the country, the patriotic health campaign has achieved great results. The most harmful epidemic diseases to the people, such as plague and smallpox, have been brought under control; cholera has not occurred, and the incidence of common diseases has also decreased significantly. Flies, mosquitoes, rats, and sparrows have been greatly reduced. This is a major cleaning and hygiene movement, a movement to break superstitions. If we mobilize all the people to persist in it, the sanitary condition of our country will be renewed, and the spirit of our nation will be greatly uplifted. This is a pioneering undertaking of changing customs and habits that no one dared to imagine in the old society. Only the people's regime under the leadership of the Communist Party, by extensively mobilizing the masses to launch patriotic health campaigns, can achieve such unprecedented great achievements. The heroic spirit of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" displayed by the broad masses of the Chinese people in the struggle to "eliminate the four pests" has won a good reputation internationally. Many foreign friends who have come to China to visit are also deeply moved by the amazing achievements of China's patriotic health campaign.

　　However, it should be pointed out that the development of the patriotic health campaign is uneven across the country. There are still many places where insufficient attention is paid to this work that is related to the people's health and socialist construction, and it has not been earnestly carried out. At the same time, there are also many places that have not made this work regular and persistently carried out the patriotic health campaign, resulting in very unstable sanitary conditions. Therefore, in order to consolidate the existing achievements and conduct mass health work more extensively and deeply, it is necessary to launch a large-scale winter patriotic health campaign nationwide, taking advantage of the current favorable winter opportunity.

　　Eliminating the four pests is an arduous task, and it is impossible to expect people to develop the habit of paying attention to hygiene overnight. However, as long as we have the determination and confidence of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains and persevere for a long time, there is nothing that cannot be done. In fact, in the past few years of the patriotic health campaign, many model units have emerged across the country. For example, in Shan County, Shandong Province, there are already 359 villages that are basically "three clean and four free" (three clean refers to clean streets, clean courtyards, and clean houses; four free refers to no flies and rats indoors, no maggots in toilets, no mosquito larvae in the courtyards, and no sparrows around the village) and "three clean and two free" villages. Pengzhuang Village in this county, which used to be known as a "dirty village" and a "sick village," suffered from dysentery in 25 people, malaria in 4 people, diarrhea in 29 people, and measles in 14 people in 1954. Among the 40 households in the village, every household had patients, which seriously affected production, with a total expenditure of more than 560 yuan on medicine. Since the launch of the patriotic health campaign last year, this village has completely changed its appearance and become the first "three clean and four free" village in Shan County. There were no patients in the autumn, the attendance rate was greatly improved, and as a result, the grain output was also greatly increased. Another example is the Fushun Mining Bureau's Open-Pit Coal Mine. The result of carrying out the patriotic health campaign has ensured the health of employees, reduced the incidence of diseases, and the attendance rate of employees has increased year by year. In 1953, the attendance rate of employees was 94.8%, which increased to 95.8% in 1954, 95.8% in 1955, and further increased to 95.9% in 1956. One of the important reasons why this mine has been able to overfulfill its production tasks in recent years is the launch of the patriotic health campaign. There are model units like this everywhere. These vivid examples powerfully illustrate that there is nothing difficult in the world, and an iron pestle can also be ground into an embroidery needle. As long as we strengthen leadership, mobilize the masses, it is possible to basically eliminate the "four pests" within a certain period of time, and the mass patriotic health campaign can be carried out and sustained.

　　Launching a patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests in winter has very favorable conditions. Mosquitoes and flies will reproduce in large numbers in the spring. Eliminating one in winter is equivalent to eliminating hundreds or thousands in the summer and autumn of next year. At this time, mobilizing the masses to carry out a comprehensive and thorough "furniture moving" cleaning, managing feces and garbage, cleaning up environmental hygiene, eliminating mosquito and fly breeding conditions, and combining with drug spraying, overwintering mosquitoes and flies can be basically eliminated, and they will not reproduce in large numbers in the spring and summer of next year. Sparrows have difficulty finding food in winter, and trapping them is also relatively easy. This winter, various places are carrying out large-scale fertilizer accumulation and water conservancy construction. When accumulating fertilizer, we can combine it with eliminating fly pupae; when constructing water conservancy, we can combine it with eliminating snails. Therefore, it is of great significance to launch a large-scale patriotic health campaign in winter.

　　The winter health campaign should be combined with winter production, fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy construction, and other central tasks in rural areas. Past experience has proved that the patriotic health campaign can only be carried out in a deep and regular way in those places where the health campaign and production, central work, are combined. At the same time, two basic links should be firmly grasped in the health campaign: one is to fully mobilize the masses, and the other is to master sanitary science and technology. The two are closely linked. After the masses are mobilized, the guidance of sanitary science and technology must closely follow, especially when the health campaign is carried out in depth, the work of scientific and technological guidance is even more important. Paying attention to science and technology in eliminating the four pests will achieve twice the result with half the effort; otherwise, if the work of technical and scientific guidance lags behind the mass movement, it will be fruitless, hinder the in-depth development of the movement, and affect the morale of the masses.

　　Carrying out a winter patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests is an important part of the National Agricultural Development Program, an important measure to promote industrial and agricultural production, and a broad mass movement. Party committees and governments at all levels must strengthen their leadership over the health campaign. Health departments should take the initiative and actively do specific work. At the same time, all relevant departments, especially agriculture, water conservancy, transportation, public security, as well as the Women's Federation and the Communist Youth League, must also strongly support and cooperate. This winter, the work tasks of rural areas and urban industrial and mining enterprises are relatively heavy, requiring Party committees and governments at all levels to combine the health campaign with various central tasks, make overall plans, unified arrangements, and extensively mobilize the masses, so that the winter patriotic health campaign can be carried out on a large scale and rapidly.

### 大力开展冬季爱国卫生运动

    大力开展冬季爱国卫生运动
    随着农业发展纲要（修正草案）的公布和党的三中全会关于积极开展卫生运动的指示的下达，各地省市党委和政府都在总结以往卫生运动的经验，因地制宜地制定卫生运动的规划；并且已经积极地抓紧冬季这一有利时机，开展了规模宏大的以除四害为中心的冬季爱国卫生运动。
    几年来，由于全国人民的努力，爱国卫生运动已经收到了很大的效果。对人民危害最大的疫病，如鼠疫、天花已被控制；霍乱没有发生过，一般疾病的发病率也都显著地下降。苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠、麻雀已经大为减少。这是一个大的清洁卫生运动，是一个破除迷信的运动，如果动员全体人民坚持搞下去，我们这个国家的卫生面貌将为之一新，我们这个民族的精神就会为之一振。这是在旧社会里没有人敢设想的移风易俗的创举。只有在共产党领导下的人民政权，广泛地发动人民群众展开爱国卫生运动，才能获得这样史无前例的伟大成就。我国广大人民在“除四害”的斗争中所表现的“愚公移山”的英雄气概，已经在国际上获得了良好的声誉。许多到中国来访问的外国朋友，也为我国人民爱国卫生运动的惊人成就而深为感动。
    但是，应该指出，爱国卫生运动在全国发展是不平衡的，还有不少地方对这一关系人民健康和社会主义建设的工作重视不够，没有认真地开展起来；同时，也有许多地方没有把这一工作经常化，坚持地开展爱国卫生运动，以致卫生的情况非常不稳定，因此，为了巩固已有的成绩并且更广泛、更深入地进行群众性的卫生工作，有必要在全国范围内，利用目前冬季的有利时机，大规模地展开冬季爱国卫生运动。
    除四害是一个艰巨的任务，使人民养成讲卫生的习惯也不可能指望一朝一夕就办到，但是，只要我们有愚公移山的决心和信心，长时间地坚持下去，没有办不到的事情。事实上，几年来爱国卫生运动中，在全国已经涌现了许多模范单位。例如山东省单县已有三百五十九个基本上“三洁四无”（三洁是指街道清洁、院子清洁、屋内清洁；四无是指室内无蝇鼠、厕所无蛆、院内无孑孓、村子周围无麻雀）和“三洁二无”村。这个县的彭庄，过去一向被称为“脏村”、“病村”，1954年还发生痢疾二十五人，疟疾四人，拉肚子二十九人，麻疹十四人，全庄四十户，户户有病人，严重地影响了生产，共开支药费五百六十多元。从去年开展爱国卫生运动以后，这个村子完全变了样，成了全单县第一个“三洁四无”庄，秋季没有一个病人，出勤率大大提高，因而粮食产量也大大增加。又如抚顺矿务局露天煤矿开展爱国卫生运动的结果，保证了职工健康，降低了发病率，职工出勤率逐年提高，1953年职工出勤率94.8％，到1954年为95.8％，1955年95.8％，1956年又提高到95.9％。这个矿几年来之所以能超额完成生产任务，其重要原因之一就是开展了爱国卫生运动。像这样的模范的单位在各地都有。这些活生生的实例有力地说明了，世上无难事，铁椎也能磨成绣花针，只要加强领导、发动群众，在一定时间内是可以基本上消灭“四害”的，群众的爱国卫生运动是能够开展并坚持下去的。
    在冬季展开以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动有着十分有利的条件。蚊子、苍蝇一到春季就将大量繁殖，冬季消灭一个，就等于明年夏秋消灭千百个。在这个时候发动群众进行一次全面彻底的“家具大搬家”的大扫除，管好粪便、垃圾，清理环境卫生，消灭蚊蝇孳生条件，并结合药物喷洒，越冬蚊蝇就可以基本消灭，到明年春夏就不会大量繁殖。麻雀在冬季觅食困难，诱捕也比较容易。今冬各地正进行着大规模的积肥和兴修水利，在积肥时就可以结合消灭蝇蛹；在兴修水利时就可以结合消灭钉螺。因此，在冬季来开展一个规模宏大的爱国卫生运动，是有很重要的意义的。
    冬季卫生运动要同冬季生产、积肥、兴修水利以及农村各项中心任务结合进行。以往的经验证明，凡是能使卫生运动和生产，中心工作相结合的地方，卫生运动就能深入，就能够经常化起来。同时，在卫生运动中应抓紧两个基本环节，一个是充分发动群众，一是掌握卫生科学技术。两者又是紧密结合的。群众被发动起来以后，卫生科学技术指导必须紧紧地跟上去，特别是在卫生运动深入开展的情况下，科学技术指导工作就更为重要。在消灭四害中讲究科学技术效果就会事半功倍；反之，技术科学指导工作落后于群众运动，就会劳而无功，使运动深入开展受到阻碍，群众情绪受到影响。
    开展以除四害为中心的冬季爱国卫生运动是农业发展纲要的一个重要部分，这是促进工农业生产的一项重要措施，而且，这又是一个广泛的群众运动。各级党委和政府必须加强对卫生运动的领导。卫生部门应主动地、积极地做好具体工作，同时各有关部门，特别是农业、水利、交通、公安以及妇联、青年团也必须大力支援、配合。今冬农村和城市工矿企业的工作任务都比较繁重，需要各级党委和政府把卫生运动和各项中心任务结合起来，通盘筹划，统一安排，广泛发动群众，使冬季爱国卫生运动得以大规模地迅速地开展。
