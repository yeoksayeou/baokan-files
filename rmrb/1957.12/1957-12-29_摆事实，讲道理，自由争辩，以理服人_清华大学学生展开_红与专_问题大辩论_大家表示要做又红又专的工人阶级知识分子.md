    This newspaper reports News. Nearly ten thousand students at Tsinghua University have launched a major socialist debate on the topic of "How to be a Laborer, How to be a Working-Class Intellectual." The broad masses of students have received a vivid socialist ideological education.

    The central purpose of this debate is to clarify the struggle between the two lines on the issue of the goals of cultivating young intellectuals, to correctly understand the relationship between politics and professional skills, theory and practice, mental and physical labor, and intellectuals and workers and peasants, to criticize the bourgeois individualistic ideas of neglecting politics, belittling practice, belittling labor, and belittling workers and peasants, and to aspire to be working-class intellectuals. In order to ensure the smooth progress of this major debate, the school Party committee also repeatedly emphasized that socialist democracy must be promoted in the debate, and the spirit of "stating the facts, reasoning, free debate, and persuading with reason" must be implemented.

    During this period, thousands of debate meetings were held throughout the school. In the debate, students raised many questions, exposing all kinds of thoughts. Due to the implementation of the spirit of "stating the facts and reasoning," a lively and vigorous debate atmosphere has been formed throughout the school.

    In this major debate, the issue of politics and professional skills, namely, "Red and Expert," was the center of the debate. Some students advocated the "Expert First, Red Later" theory, which is a phased theory. They believe that "professional skills can be made up for in ten years if they are not learned in one year, but politics can be made up for in one year if they are not learned in ten years." At school, "the main thing is to learn professional skills well," and it is very "easy" to become "Red" in the future. They often cite the progress of some natural scientists after liberation to prove that the "Expert First, Red Later" path is also feasible under today's historical conditions. Some students put forward the "More Expert, Less Red" theory, believing that it is not good not to be "Red." However, being "Red" affects being "Expert" and is also a "loss." Therefore, they propose to be a "Red Radish," just a little "pink." Someone said, "Socialism is a big ship, and the helmsman who controls the direction is the Party. I just need to be an honest passenger." This "More Expert, Less Red" theory can also be called the political "middle road" theory. Some people also advocate the "Expert is Red" theory, that is, the theory that professional skills are politics. They believe that "good professional skills are good politics. As long as a person has good professional skills, he will naturally become Red in politics."

    Everyone launched a heated debate on the above ideological issues. Many people believe that one of the mistakes of those who advocate taking the "pink" road is that they deny the promoting role of politics on professional skills. Countless facts show that socialist consciousness is the driving force for everyone's progress. Only by continuously improving socialist consciousness and studying Marxism can one become an expert needed by socialism better and faster.

    Those who advocate "Expert First, Red Later" believe that limited time should be used to learn professional skills well first. After debate, many students realized that the relationship between Red and Expert is not a matter of time. In the process of learning professional skills, one's mind cannot be a vacuum. If one does not accept socialist ideas, one will accept capitalist ideas. Students who disagree with taking the "Expert First, Red Later" path especially pointed out that "Expert First, Red Later" was a characteristic of the past era. Under the current social conditions, it is necessary to take the path of "Both Red and Expert." Some students pointed out the danger of "Expert First, Red Later." An expert without a political soul is like a commodity, depending on the price. Whoever offers the higher price can buy it. How can such an expert serve the people wholeheartedly?

    In the debate on the "Red and Expert" issue, everyone also launched a discussion on the current issue of the Party's proposal to catch up with Britain in about fifteen years. Some students believe that the decisive factor in catching up with Britain is technology, so it is necessary to be Expert first. Many people pointed out that if having technical cadres could determine the speed of development, then Britain and the United States have no shortage of technical cadres. Why is the speed of scientific level improvement far behind the Soviet Union? The problem is that only socialist countries can cultivate experts who not only surpass the United States in quality but also in quantity. This proves that an important factor in our ability to catch up with Britain is that our country has a superior socialist system. To catch up with Britain, we must rely on cadres who are both Red and Expert who serve the people wholeheartedly. They unconditionally obey the interests of the people and serve the people. Those who advocate taking the "pink" middle road can only obey the interests of the country under certain conditions and serve the people conditionally. Relying on these people will not catch up with Britain. Therefore, our direction is very clear: to catch up with Britain, we must cultivate cadres who are both Red and Expert.

    Everyone also launched a debate on the issue of the view of life of science for science's sake. Many students believe that this statement is wrong. This view believes that engaging in scientific work is noble work, while other revolutionary work is insignificant. It is a bourgeois individualistic view of fame and gain that "all other professions are inferior, only science is high." One student gave an example, saying that if a scientist saw a child drowning, he would say that rescuing people from the water is "simple labor," and he might even sacrifice himself as a result, thus abandoning his "noble" scientific career. Therefore, he would not do the noble thing of saving lives. May I ask, what nobility does such a scientist have?

    When debating the issue of politics and professional skills, Red and Expert, many students cited the example of He Zheng, a student in the power department. As early as this spring, He Zheng put forward the argument of "Expert First, Red Later." He believed that only by studying professional skills well and becoming a scientist could he have a golden rice bowl, and the Party would invite him to join the Party. Because he adhered to bourgeois individualistic ideas of fame and gain, during the period of Great Blooming and Great Debating, this person who usually sang the tune of "not asking about politics" showed great "concern" for politics. He praised right-wingers Lin Xiling and Tan Tianrong as "true Marxists-Leninists" and viciously attacked the Party, becoming a right-wing element. This fact shows that it is impossible to leave the correct political direction, and one will inevitably go astray.

    In the debate, everyone deeply realized the essence of the "Expert First, Red Later" theory, as Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his "Speech at the Meeting of All Circles in Beijing Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution": "Taking detachment from politics as a slogan, asking people to refuse to transform themselves, and refusing the standpoint of the working class, is actually a slogan guiding people to take the old road of bourgeois intellectuals. Our intellectuals must understand that politics cannot be detached. Detachment from revolutionary politics may lead to reactionary politics. Without a correct political standpoint, one may fall into a reactionary political standpoint. Even if such a person has learned some knowledge and professional skills, it is impossible for him to serve the socialist cause sincerely and reliably and serve the workers and peasants wholeheartedly."

    In addition to launching a debate on the "Red and Expert" issue, Tsinghua University students also launched debates on issues such as the integration of theory with practice and the ideological transformation of intellectuals.

### 摆事实，讲道理，自由争辩，以理服人  清华大学学生展开“红与专”问题大辩论  大家表示要做又红又专的工人阶级知识分子

    摆事实，讲道理，自由争辩，以理服人
    清华大学学生展开“红与专”问题大辩论
    大家表示要做又红又专的工人阶级知识分子
    本报讯　清华大学近万名学生以“怎样做一个劳动者，做一个工人阶级知识分子”为题展开了社会主义大辩论。广大学生受到了生动的社会主义思想教育。
    这次辩论的中心目的是要明确在知识青年培养目标问题上的两条路线的斗争，正确认识政治与业务、理论与实践、脑力劳动与体力劳动、知识分子与工农关系等问题，批判忽视政治、轻视实践、轻视劳动、轻视工农的资产阶级个人主义思想，立志做一个工人阶级的知识分子。为了使这次大辩论能顺利进行，学校党委还反复强调在辩论中必须注意发扬社会主义民主，贯彻“摆事实，讲道理，自由争辩，以理服人”的精神。
    在这一期间，全校召开了数以千计的辩论会。在辩论中，学生提出了许多问题，暴露了形形色色的思想。由于贯彻了“摆事实，讲道理”的精神，目前全校形成生动活泼的辩论风气。
    在这次大辩论中，关于政治与业务即“红与专”的问题是辩论的中心。有些学生主张“先专后红”论，也就是分段论。他们认为：“业务一年不学十年补，政治十年不学一年补”。在学校中，“主要把业务学好就行了”，将来要“红”起来是很“容易”的事。他们往往举出解放以后一些自然科学家的进步的例子，来证明“先专后红”的道路在今天的历史条件下也是走得通的。有的学生则提出“多专少红”论，认为不“红”不好。但“红”了影响“专”也“吃亏”。所以提出要做个“红皮萝卜”，有点“粉红色”就行了。有人说，“社会主义是只大船，掌握方向的舵手是党，我只要老老实实作个乘客就行了。”这种“多专少红”论也可以称为政治上的“中间道路”论。也有人主张，“专了即红”论，也就是业务即政治论，他们认为“业务好就是政治好，一个人只要业务好，在政治上也就自然而然地红了”。
    大家针对以上思想问题展开热烈辩论。许多人认为，主张走“粉红色”道路的人的错误之一就是否认政治对业务的推动作用。无数事实说明，社会主义觉悟是推动大家前进的动力。只有不断提高社会主义觉悟，学习马克思主义，才能使自己更好更快地成为社会主义所需要的专家。
    主张“先专后红”的人认为要用有限的时间先学好业务。许多学生经过辩论，认识到红与专的关系不是时间上的问题。在学习业务的过程中，思想上不可能是真空的。不接受社会主义思想，就会接受资本主义思想。不同意走“先专后红”的道路的学生，特别指出“先专后红”是过去时代的特点。在现在的社会条件下，要走“又红又专”的道路。有的学生指出了“先专后红”的危险性，一个没有政治灵魂的专家，就像商品一样，要看价钱，谁出的价钱多，谁就可以买得到。这样的专家如何能全心全意为人民服务？
    在“红与专”问题的辩论中，大家还针对当前党提出十五年左右赶上英国的问题展开讨论。有的学生认为，要赶上英国，起决定性作用的是技术，所以要先专。许多人指出，如果有了技术干部就能决定发展速度的话，那么英国、美国的技术干部并不少，又为什么科学水平提高的速度远落后于苏联呢？问题在于，只有社会主义国家才能培养出不仅在质量上而且在数量上也远超过美国的专家。这证明我们能赶上英国的重要因素，是我国具有优越的社会主义制度。我们赶上英国就要靠全心全意为人民服务的又红又专的干部，他们是无条件地服从人民利益，为人民服务的。那些主张走“粉红色”中间路线的人，只有在一定条件下，才能服从国家利益，是有条件为人民服务的。依靠这些人是不能赶上英国的。因此，我们的方向很明确，要赶上英国，必须培养又红又专的干部。
    在为科学而科学的人生观的问题上，大家也展开了辩论。许多学生认为这种提法是错误的。这种观点以为从事科学工作才是高贵的工作，而其他革命工作是微不足道的，是一种“万般皆下品，唯有科学高”的资产阶级个人名利观点。有个学生举例说，如果有个科学家，见到一个小孩快被水淹死了，但他却说，下水救人是“简单的劳动”，而且自己还可能因而牺牲，而致放弃自己从事的“崇高的”科学事业。因此，他就不去做救死扶伤的高贵的事情了。试问，这样的科学家有什么崇高可言呢？
    很多学生在辩论政治与业务、红与专的问题时，都引用了动力系学生何正的例子。何正早在今年春天就提出了“先专后红”的论调。他认为只有学好业务，当上了科学家，就有了金饭碗，党就会请他入党。由于他坚持资产阶级个人主义名利思想，在大放大鸣时，这个平时高唱“不问政治”的人对政治表现得非常“关心”，他赞扬右派分子林希翎、谭天荣是“真正的马列主义者”，恶毒地向党进攻，成为右派分子。这个事实说明，离开正确的政治方向是不行的，必定走上迷途。
    大家在辩论中，深刻认识到“先专后红”论的本质，正如刘少奇同志“在北京各界庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年大会上的讲话”中所指出的：“以脱离政治作为号召，要人们拒绝改造自己，拒绝工人阶级的立场，这实际上是引导人们走资产阶级知识分子老路的口号。我们的知识分子必须懂得，政治是脱离不了的。脱离了革命的政治，就可能走向反动的政治。没有正确的政治立场，就可能陷入反动的政治立场。这样的人即使学到了一些知识和业务，也决不可能真诚可靠地为社会主义事业服务，全心全意地为工人农民服务。”
    清华大学学生除对“红与专”的问题展开辩论外，还对理论联系实际、知识分子思想改造等问题展开了辩论。
