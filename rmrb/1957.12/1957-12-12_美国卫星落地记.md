　　A Record of the American Satellite Landing

    December 6th was a big day for those Americans who consider themselves chosen by God to "lead" the world. Because, their experimental artificial satellite, carried by the "Vanguard" rocket, after repeated delays, was finally scheduled to go to heaven on this day. Although this "elegant" little sphere of the United States was more than two months later than the first Soviet artificial earth satellite, and it weighed only 1.5 kilograms, not even a fraction of the two Soviet satellites (weighing 83.6 kilograms and 508.3 kilograms respectively), after all, it was going to heaven. At the top-level meeting of the North Atlantic Group to be held in ten days, the United States could at least shout to its allies: "Look! Our bright little moon is in the sky!"
    In fact, the American "God's chosen people" had already planned to exaggerate the plan of sending this small sphere into the sky as a sensational event around the world. On October 9, the fifth day after the first Soviet satellite went to heaven, Eisenhower wrote a guarantee that the "Vanguard" would be launched into space to orbit in December. When the calendar was turned to December, the American propaganda machine became very busy. News, pictures, and feature stories about the planned launch of the "Vanguard" satellite were broadcast to the world in large quantities; the United States Information Service even pre-emptively "awarded merits" and published a "honor roll", bragging about the resume of the person in charge of the "Vanguard" program; the United Press also issued a message comparing the American satellite with the Soviet satellite, as if the American satellite was already in operation in the sky. Television networks and radio stations even made all preparations to allow the world to hear or witness the live launch of the American satellite.
    Just as they thought the United States was definitely the first country to send a satellite into space, so they named the satellite "Vanguard" without hesitation, the "God's chosen people" this time also firmly believed that their satellite would be launched successfully, so they boasted so much. Eisenhower said in October that the American satellite program was "well-ordered and precisely timed."
    Of course, according to the original "precise" schedule, the American satellite was to begin launch preparations "step by step" at 9:00 pm on December 3, and let it go to heaven at 4:00 pm on the 4th. However, unfortunately, some "minor difficulties" occurred in the original "well-ordered" plan. The "step by step" work was postponed from 9:00 pm on the 3rd to 11:00 pm, then to midnight, then to 1:00 am on the 4th, and then to 2:45 am—it was postponed like this, finally making it impossible to launch at the scheduled time. However, as dusk fell on the 4th, things seemed to be improving, and the official announcement was made that it would be launched at 7:40 pm. The United Press excitedly announced to the world: "The United States is ready tonight to enter the gate of the space age!" However, there was a lot of thunder, but no rain fell.
    What was the reason? The United States Information Service prepared a ready-made explanation: (1) There was a leak in a valve inside the rocket; (2) The wind direction was unfavorable; (3) The staff was "extremely tired"!
    However, the American satellite program was still "well-ordered". Walsh, the deputy director of the satellite launch program, happily announced on the 5th that the "step by step" of the new launch work would only take six or seven hours to complete, and the Weather Bureau predicted that the weather on the morning of the 6th would be good and the wind direction would be favorable.
    Sure enough, the weather was good. The sun shone warmly on the test site on the morning of the 6th—the beach at Cape Canaveral, Florida. This kind of weather would no longer hinder the satellite from going to heaven. So, before 11:45 am (the scheduled "going to heaven" time), crowds flocked to the launch site, and two hundred reporters, with all kinds of noble photography equipment, were preparing to film the "Vanguard" "going to heaven".
    The clock pointed to 11:45 am, the machine started; two minutes later, at 11:47 am, the "Vanguard" that people had been waiting for for a long time "went to heaven". The reporters, standing on the dunes in the safe zone outside the field, quickly aimed their cameras at the target. Suddenly, a rumbling sound, followed by a fireball rising fifty to one hundred feet, followed by a "thud", the "Vanguard" crashed back onto the launch pad and exploded. The clock was pointing to 11:47 and two seconds—the "Vanguard" only had the blessing of "going to heaven" for two seconds, and this "heaven" was less than four feet from the ground.
    The sensational event that shook the world really happened, although not the kind of sensation that the "God's chosen people" had hoped for.

　　美国卫星落地记
　　施旅
    12月6日，对美国那些自认为是被上帝挑选来“领导”世界的人说来，是一个大日子。因为，他们的由“先锋号”火箭载运的实验性人造卫星，经过一而再、再而三地拖延之后，终于决定要在这一天上天了。虽然美国的这个“优雅”的小球体距离苏联的第一颗人造地球卫星上天已经两个多月，而且它只有一点五公斤重，连两颗苏联卫星（分别重八十三点六公斤和五百零八点三公斤）的零头都不到，然而毕竟它要上天了。在十天后举行的北大西洋集团的最高级会议上，美国至少可以向它的那些盟国大喝一声：“你们看！我们的光彩夺目的小月亮正在天上呢！”
    事实上，美国的“上帝的选民”们早就要把这个小球体上天的计划渲染成为一桩轰动全世界的事情。在10月9日，也就是苏联第一颗卫星上天之后的第五天，艾森豪威尔就写下了要在12月间把“先锋号”射入太空循轨道运转的包票。等到日历撕到12月份，美国的宣传机构便大忙特忙起来。关于计划发射“先锋号”卫星的消息、图片和特写等，大量地向全世界播发了出去；美国新闻处还预先“论功行赏”，发表了“光荣榜”，把“先锋”计划负责人的履历吹嘘了一番；合众社还发了一条美国卫星和苏联卫星对比的消息，就好像美国卫星已经在天上运转了一样。电视网和广播电台甚至作好了一切准备，要让全世界耳闻或目睹美国卫星上天的实况。
    就像他们以为美国准定是第一个把卫星送上天的国家，所以毫不迟疑地把卫星命名为“先锋”一样，那些“上帝的选民”们这回也是深信不疑地以为他们的卫星一定发射成功，所以才这样大吹大擂。艾森豪威尔在10月里就说过，美国的卫星计划“订得很好，并且时间进度订得很精确”。
    当然，按照原来定得很“精确”的时间进度，美国的这个卫星是要在12月3日下午九时就“按步就班”开始发射准备工作，4日下午四时就让它上天的。可是，不幸得很，原来“定得很好”的计划却出了一些“小困难”，“按步就班”的工作从3日下午九时推迟到下午十一时，后来推迟到午夜，又推到四日清晨一时，又推到二时四十五分——就是这样推下去，终于使得在预定时间发射成为不可能了。不过，到4日下午暮色苍茫的时候，事情似乎有了起色，官方正式宣布要在下午七时四十分发射了。合众社兴奋地向全世界宣布：“美国今晚准备停当，就要进入空间时代的大门”！然而雷声虽大，雨点还是没有下来。
    什么原因呢？美国新闻处准备了现成的解释：（一）火箭内部的一个活门有漏洞；（二）风向不利；（三）工作人员“极其疲劳”了！
    不过，美国的卫星计划仍然是“定得很好”的。卫星发射计划的副主任华尔希在5日愉快地宣布，新的发射工作的“按步就班”只要六小时或七小时就可以完成了，而且气象局预告6日上午的气候良好、风向有利。
    果然，天公作美。6日上午阳光和煦地照着试验场地——佛罗里达州的卡纳维拉尔角的海滩。这种天气再也不会妨碍卫星上天了。于是，在上午十一时四十五分（预定的“上天”时间）以前，人群涌向发射场，二百名记者带着各种高贵的摄影器材，准备把“先锋号”“上天”的实况摄制下来。
    时针指到十一时四十五分，机器开动；两分钟以后，十一时四十七分，人们鹄候多时的“先锋号”“上天”了。站在场外安全地带的沙丘上的记者们，连忙把镜头对准着目标。忽然，一阵轰隆隆的声音，接着一个火球冒上去五十英尺到一百英尺，紧跟着，“叭嗒”一声，“先锋号”撞回到发射台上，爆炸了。时针正指着十一时四十七分零两秒——“先锋号”只有“上天”两秒钟的福分，而且这个“天”离地不到四英尺。
    轰动全世界的事情果真发生了，虽然不是“上帝的选民”们所希望的那种轰动。
