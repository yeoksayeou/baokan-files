Xinhua News Agency report: Washington - The Indonesian Embassy in the United States issued a statement to the press on December 9, pointing out that if the North Atlantic Group interferes in the dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands, it will be considered "aimed at the freedom of all Asian and African countries."

The Indonesian Embassy spokesman said that the Indonesian Ambassador to the United States has informally conveyed to the State Department the Indonesian government's views on the emergency meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Permanent Council.

Dutch Ambassador to the United States, E.H. van Roijen, said in a televised speech on the 8th that the Netherlands is not prepared to hand over West Irian, and the Netherlands cannot negotiate with Indonesia on the "sovereignty issue" of West Irian. The people of West Irian are to be "developed and trained" by the Netherlands to decide their own destiny.

In his speech, Van Roijen also requested the United States to give the Dutch colonialism more open and direct support.

The facts show that the U.S. government is continuing to plot to interfere in Indonesia's anti-colonialist struggle. State Department spokesman White said on the 9th that the Dutch request for "allied" diplomatic support for the Netherlands had been submitted to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, and that the issue would be "considered" by the Council.

Secretary of State Dulles dispatched Maine, the head of the Southwest Pacific Section of the State Department, to Jakarta on the 8th to collect first-hand information on the so-called "unrest situation" in Indonesia. Maine will consult with the US Ambassador to Indonesia, Allison.

Some American newspapers, reflecting the views of the American ruling group, continue to publish remarks against the Indonesian government and people. The "New York Herald Tribune" on the 9th openly slandered the Indonesian people's actions to safeguard national sovereignty in the tone of a colonialist as "neurotic" and "crude, illegal attempts." This newspaper also insisted that Indonesia has no right to recover West Irian. The "New York Times" editorial on the 8th also defamed Indonesia's anti-colonialist struggle as "rash irresponsibility." The editorial said that the Netherlands "should get the support of its allies."

Jakarta's "Eastern Star" newspaper on the 9th accused the United States and Britain of putting pressure on the Indonesian government after Indonesia took action against the Netherlands, in an attempt to force Indonesia to adopt a moderate attitude towards the Netherlands. The US attitude shows that it has become the protector of the Netherlands. Britain is desperately supporting the Netherlands in the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

According to Oslo news: The Norwegian Farmers' Party Central Organ newspaper "Daily News" published an editorial on the 9th, warning the North Atlantic Group not to interfere in Indonesia's affairs.

    印度尼西亚驻美大使馆发表声明
    警告大西洋集团不要多事
    美国仍阴谋干涉印度尼西亚的斗争
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：华盛顿消息：印度尼西亚驻美大使馆12月9日向报界发表声明指出，如果北大西洋集团干涉印度尼西亚同荷兰之间的争端，将被认为“矛头是指向所有亚非国家的自由”。
    印度尼西亚驻美大使馆发言人说，印度尼西亚驻美大使已经非正式地向国务院转达了印度尼西亚政府对北大西洋公约组织常任理事会紧急会议的看法。
    荷兰驻美国大使伊·赫·范罗仁8日发表电视谈话说，荷兰不准备把西伊里安交出来，荷兰也不能就西伊里安的“主权问题”同印度尼西亚进行协商。西伊里安人民要由荷兰来“发展和训练”他们决定他们自己的命运。
    范罗仁在演说里还要求美国给予荷兰殖民主义更公开和直接的支持。
    事实说明，美国政府正在继续阴谋对印度尼西亚的反对殖民主义斗争进行干涉。国务院发言人怀特9日说，已经把荷兰要求“盟国”在外交上支持荷兰一事向北大西洋公约组织理事会提出，这个问题将在理事会上“进行考虑”。
    国务卿杜勒斯在8日派遣了国务院西南太平洋科科长麦恩到雅加达，去收集所谓印度尼西亚的“不安局势”的第一手情报。麦恩将同美国驻印度尼西亚大使艾利逊磋商。
    反映美国统治集团意见的一些美国报纸继续在发表反对印度尼西亚政府和人民的言论。“纽约先驱论坛报”9日公然用殖民主义者的口吻污蔑印度尼西亚人民维护国家主权的行动是“神经错乱”，是“粗野的、非法的企图”。这家报纸还硬说，印度尼西亚无权收复西伊安里。“纽约时报”8日社论也诽谤印度尼西亚反对殖民主义的斗争是“轻率的不负责任”。社论说，荷兰“应该得到它的盟国的支持”。
    雅加达“东星报”9日指责美国和英国在印度尼西亚对荷兰采取行动以后对印度尼西亚政府施加压力，企图迫使印度尼西亚对荷兰采取和缓的态度。美国的态度表明它已经成为荷兰的保护者。英国则在联合国和北大西洋公约组织中拚命支持荷兰。
    另据奥斯陆消息：挪威农民党中央机关报“日报”9日发表社论，警告北大西洋集团不要干涉印度尼西亚的事务。
