　　What Makes a Good Trade Union Worker?

    What makes a good trade union worker?

    The example of Li Bin, the trade union chairman of the Songzi Liuhuang Mine in Hubei Province, provides us with the answer. Viewing trade union work as a cause of the Party, rather than something unimportant; when there are difficulties in production, trade union cadres take the lead in overcoming them; caring for the workers' lives in a detailed and meticulous way, rather than thinking of it as a trivial matter; befriending the workers and becoming their confidants, being able to name eight hundred people out of the one thousand and sixty workers, and so on. In summary, Li Bin has established a correct style of mass work, which is the central theme of the answer.

    Perhaps you will say that none of the above is so remarkable. Indeed, these deeds are not as earth-shattering as Huang Jiguang sacrificing himself for the country, but many trade union workers cannot achieve them, or their understanding is not clear. You say that trade union work is an important task led by the Party, but some people say that trade union workers are unambitious third- or fourth-class cadres. You say that trade union cadres should assist the administration in doing a good job in production, but some people say that production is the administration's business, and the trade union only manages the cafeteria and the club. You say that trade union cadres must go deep into the masses and make friends with the workers, but some people only stay in the office, or take a grand tour of the workshops and construction sites for a month or two. Needless to say, they can't name eight hundred people out of more than a thousand workers; being able to name eighty would be considered good. It seems that achieving what Li Bin has achieved is not extremely easy. The first question is whether you regard trade union work as a cause of the Party, an indispensable assistant to the Party's leadership in production, and a communist school for the working masses. The second question is whether you are determined to establish a work style like Li Bin's, going deep into the masses and becoming one with them.

    Our socialist construction is constantly developing. We already have many trade union cadres like Li Bin who are closely connected with the masses, but we need more. Because this is beneficial to the Party and the working class.

    怎样才算是一个好的工会工作者？
    湖北省松滋琉璜矿的工会主席李斌的事例，向我们提出了答案。把工会工作看成是党的事业，而不是什么不重要的事；生产上有困难，工会干部带头去战胜困难；具体入微地关心工人的生活，而不是大而化之认为这是生活小事；和工人交上了朋友，而且成了工人的知心朋友，在一千零六十名工人中能够讲出八百人的姓名等等。归结起来，李斌树立了正确的群众工作作风，这是答案的主题。
    也许你会说，以上这些并没有多大了不起。确实这些事迹也不像黄继光舍身为国那样惊天地泣鬼神，然而却有不少工会工作者做不到，或者认识不清楚。你说工会工作是党领导的重要工作，有人却说，工会工作者是没有出息的三等或者四等干部。你说工会干部要协助行政搞好生产，有人却说，生产是行政的事，工会只管食堂、俱乐部。你说工会干部一定要深入群众和工人交上朋友，有人却只呆在办公室里，或者一个月两个月大模大样地到车间工地走一走。不用说一千多名工人中叫不出八百个名字，能叫出八十个名字就算不错。看起来要做到李斌所做到的那样，也还不是绝顶容易，问题首先在于你是不是把工会工作当作党的事业、是党领导生产不可缺少的助手、是工人群众的共产主义学校。其次要看你有没有决心树立起像李斌那样深入群众和群众打成一片的工作作风。
    我们的社会主义建设事业不断向前发展。我们已经有了许多像李斌这样密切联系群众的工会干部，但我们还需要更多。因为这样对党对工人阶级有利。
