    Defenders of Traitors
    Lin Mohan
    Revolutionary traitors are the most detestable things. It is difficult to find anything in the world that can compare to a revolutionary traitor. As Gorky said, compared to a traitor, one would even be insulting a typhus-carrying louse.
    The characteristic of traitors is extreme egoism. In order to save their own lives, or to earn some money to live a comfortable life, they can betray the revolutionary organization, betray the revolutionary class, or their own country. They are indeed more hateful than blood-sucking lice, because they feed themselves by selling out comrades, by licking the blood droplets from the executioner's blade.
    However, some people who call themselves revolutionaries openly defend revolutionary traitors. One of them is Feng Xuefeng. When Japanese imperialism was implementing the "Three Alls" policy in China, and the Kuomintang reactionaries were colluding with the Japanese in secret, attempting to eliminate the Communist Party, Feng Xuefeng was in Chongqing, where Kuomintang secret agents were rampant, talking at length about his "love for humanity," while believing that loyalty to "friends" seemed to be more important than loyalty to the revolutionary organization, the class, and the nation. In his article "On Friendship," he said: "For example, if two friends or comrades, one of them has a rebellious or destructive attempt against the nation or society, or the class, or the group to which they belong (this is to say that this rebellion or destruction is not a good revolutionary act)," and the other reports his attempt to the society or group, then, "this may be said to be loyal to the society or group, but it is sinister and almost frightening to the friend or comrade; and here, loyalty to the society and group is inseparable from loyalty to the friend or comrade, so that the seeming loyalty to the society or group is often questionable." This is Feng Xuefeng's view of "loyalty." As long as it is his "friend," even if that person wants to betray the party and surrender to the enemy, he must maintain "loyalty" to him. For a long time, Feng Xuefeng confused friend and foe, taking turncoat and renegade elements as friends, and treating comrades loyal to the Party as enemies to attack, which is not surprising at all.
    Another defender of traitors is Xu Maoyong. A year ago, under the instigation of imperialism, an anti-communist wave appeared internationally, and for a time the sky seemed to be filled with dark clouds, and some wavering or unreliable elements in the revolutionary camp suddenly revealed their true colors, some wavered, some defected. They joined the anti-communist and anti-Soviet chorus directed by imperialism. The American writer Howard Fast was one of them. He announced his shameful decision, abandoned the glorious title of Communist Party member, and trampled underfoot what he had always regarded as sacred. Many honest people denounced Fast's shameful defection, but Xu Maoyong defended Fast, saying: "I don't want to oppose Fast's withdrawal from the party, and I still have a certain respect for him. Because, while he opposes the Soviet Union and the dictatorship of the proletariat, he still opposes American imperialism." Is it possible for a Communist Party member to abandon his beliefs and become a pawn against the Soviet Union and the dictatorship of the proletariat, while still opposing American imperialism? In fact, the American imperialists, whom Xu Maoyong believed Fast was still opposing, welcomed Fast's behavior very much. Fast's shameful talk announcing his withdrawal from the Communist Party was first published in the famous reactionary American newspaper "The New York Times." Contrary to what Xu Maoyong said, Fast, while attacking the Soviet Union and slandering communism, also shamelessly praised "that wonderful thing - American democracy." As William Foster, a prominent activist of the American Communist Party, said: His (Fast's) current slanders against the Soviet Union and attacks against the Communist Parties of various countries are entirely beneficial to the class enemies.
    It was this Fast, who won the cheers of imperialism, who won Xu Maoyong's "respect," and also received Feng Xuefeng's sympathy.
    One is loyal to traitors, and the other respects traitors. Why do they have such a good feeling for revolutionary traitors? Because the extreme egoism that makes all traitors traitors is in the same vein as their bourgeois individualism. Although they were once Communist Party members in the organization, they were not only "above the party when they were successful, and outside the party when they were unsuccessful" in their thinking, but also always opposed to the party. Their own anti-Party and anti-socialist sentiments coincided exactly with the sentiments of the traitors. Birds of a feather flock together. Crows will always find their black kindred.
    Feng Xuefeng and Xu Maoyong were not a gang in the past, and there were even contradictions between them. Despite this, it does not prevent their consistency in worldview. They are both extremely serious bourgeois individualists. It is precisely this fundamental common point that makes them, without prior consultation, become sympathizers and defenders of revolutionary traitors, and reach the same end by different routes, falling together into the quagmire of bourgeois rightists. This is by no means a chance coincidence.

### 叛徒的辩护士

    叛徒的辩护士
    林默涵
    革命的叛徒是最使人厌恶的东西。世界上很难找出什么东西可以同革命的叛徒相比较。正如高尔基所说的，同叛徒比较，甚至于会侮辱了伤寒症的虱子。
    叛徒的特点，是极端的利己主义。他们为着要保住自己的一条命，或者为着要赚些钱来过舒服的日子，就可以背叛革命的组织、背叛革命的阶级或自己的祖国。他们的确比吸血的虱子还要可恶，因为它们是靠出卖同志，靠舔食刽子手刀口上的血滴来喂饱自己的肚子的。
    可是，有些自称为革命者的人却竟然公开地为革命的叛徒作辩护。其中之一，就是冯雪峰。正当日本帝国主义在中国实行“三光”政策，而国民党反动派则明里暗里与日寇勾结，企图消灭共产党的时候，冯雪峰却在当时国民党特务横行的重庆大谈其“人类之爱”，同时认为忠于“朋友”似乎比忠于革命的组织、忠于阶级和民族还更重要。他在“论友爱”一文中这样说：“例如两个朋友或同志，有一个对于民族或社会，或阶级，或他们所属的集团有叛逆或破坏的企图（这是说这叛逆或破坏并非好的革命的行为）”，而另一个将他的企图向社会或团体告发，那末，“这对于社会或团体也许可说是忠诚的，但对于朋友或同志却是居心险恶，近于可怕；而且在这里，对社会和团体的忠诚是和对朋友或同志的忠诚分不开的，所以那对社会或团体的形似的忠实也常是可疑的。”这就是冯雪峰对于“忠诚”的看法。只要是他的“朋友”，即使那个人想要叛党投敌，也要对他保持“忠诚”。长期以来，冯雪峰敌我不分，引变节叛党分子为朋友，把忠实于党的同志当作敌人来打击，这就一点也不奇怪了。
    叛徒的另一个辩护士是徐懋庸。一年前，在帝国主义策动下，国际上出现了一股反共浪潮，一时天空似乎布满了阴云，在革命阵营中的一些不坚定或不可靠的分子，就一下子现出原形，有的动摇，有的叛变了。他们加入了帝国主义所指挥的反共反苏大合唱。美国作家法斯特就是其中的一个。他宣布了他的可耻的决定，抛弃了共产党员的光荣称号，把自己一向所奉为神圣的东西践踏在脚下。许多正直的人指斥了法斯特的这种可耻的变节行为，而徐懋庸却竟然替法斯特辩护，他说：“我不想反对法斯特的退党，而且，我对他还有一定的尊重。因为，他在反对苏联，反对无产阶级专政的同时，他仍然反对美帝国主义。”一个共产党员背弃了自己的信仰，变成了反对苏联、反对无产阶级专政的走卒，而同时却仍然反对美帝国主义，这是可能的吗？事实上，被徐懋庸认为法斯特仍然在反对的美帝国主义者是十分欢迎法斯特的行为的，法斯特宣布他退出共产党的可耻的谈话，就是首先在美国有名的反动报纸“纽约时报”上发表的。恰恰与徐懋庸所说的相反，法斯特在攻击苏联、诽谤共产主义的同时，还无耻地赞美了“那绝妙的东西——美国民主”。正如美国共产党的著名活动家威廉·福斯特所说的：他（法斯特）目前对苏联进行的诽谤和对各国共产党进行的攻击，是完全有利于阶级敌人的。
    就是这个博得了帝国主义的喝采的法斯特，赢得了徐懋庸的“尊重”，也得到了冯雪峰的同情。
    一个对叛徒忠诚，一个对叛徒尊重。为什么他们对于革命的叛徒那样有好感呢？因为使一切叛徒所以成为叛徒的极端的利己主义正是跟他们的资产阶级个人主义一脉相通，他们虽然在组织上曾经是共产党员，在思想上却不仅是“得意时在党之上，失意时在党之外”，而且始终是和党相对立的。他们自己的反党反社会主义的情绪正好跟叛徒们的情绪相吻合。物以类聚，人以群分，乌鸦总是会找到它们的黑色的同类的。
    冯雪峰，徐懋庸，这两个人过去并不是一伙的，在他们之间甚至还有过矛盾。虽然如此，却并不妨碍他们在世界观上的一致性，他们都是极端严重的资产阶级个人主义者。正是这个根本的共同点，使他们不约而同地成了革命叛徒的同情者和辩护士，而且殊途同归地一齐掉进了资产阶级右派的泥坑。这决不是偶然的巧合。
