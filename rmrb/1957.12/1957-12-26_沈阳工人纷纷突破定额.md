    Welcoming 1958
    Shenyang Workers Break Through Quotas
    (Our newspaper Shenyang, December 25th) The workers in various factories and enterprises in Shenyang City are welcoming the country's Second Five-Year Plan with ever-increasing production enthusiasm. By the end of November, more than 12,600 workers in twelve state-owned factories, including Shenyang Fan Factory, Screw Factory, and Agricultural Machinery Factory, had broken through the state quota, accounting for 70% of the production workers in these twelve factories. Now, more and more people are breaking through quotas.
    Some factory workers are also taking the initiative to revise unreasonable quotas. Deng Qingcheng, an old worker at the Shenyang Fan Factory, saw that the quota was unreasonable and took the initiative to request a revision. In a few days, 70% of the workers in the factory generally responded, demanding a reduction in the quota. Now, the factory leadership has reduced the quota for 61% of the parts in the factory according to the workers' requests (the average reduction in the total man-hour quota for all parts is 12.9%). In the past, some workers in the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory had "three nos" thoughts, such as "not working if the quota is too small, not working if the parts are not complete, and not working on odd jobs." Now, under the education of the Party, the workers have criticized this kind of thinking that disregards national interests and have loudly proposed the action slogan of "willing to do odd jobs, willing to shave single parts, and actively breaking through quotas." The original quota for making a certain type of machine tool in this factory was 485 hours, but now the workers can make it in only 400 hours.

    迎接1958年
    沈阳工人纷纷突破定额
    本报沈阳25日电　沈阳市各工厂企业的职工以愈来愈高涨的生产热情，迎接国家第二个五年计划。到11月底止，沈阳扇风机厂、螺钉厂、农业机械厂等十二个国营工厂有一万二千六百多名工人突破了国家定额，占这十二个工厂生产工人的70％。现在突破定额的人越来越多了。
    有些工厂的工人还主动要求修改不合理的定额。沈阳扇风机厂老工人邓庆澄，看到定额不合理，主动要求修改，不几天，全厂就有70％的工人普遍响应，要求压缩定额。现在工厂领导方面已经根据工人的要求，压缩了全厂61％的部件定额（全部部件工时定额平均降低了12.9％）。沈阳第三机床厂部分工人过去曾有“定额少不干，部件不成套不干，调零活不干”等“三不干”的思想，现在工人们在党的教育下，批判了这种不顾国家利益的思想，响亮地提出“零活愿干，单件愿削，积极突破定额”的行动口号。这个厂原来做一种机床，定额是四百八十五小时，现在工人们只要四百小时就能做出来。
