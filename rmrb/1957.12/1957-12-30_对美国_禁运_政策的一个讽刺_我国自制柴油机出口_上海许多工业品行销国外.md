Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 28th – As the United States still lists diesel engines as one of the commodities "embargoed" to China, diesel engines made in China have already been exported to Egypt and Syria. This year, international merchant ships departing from Shanghai carried many kinds of machinery, instruments, telecommunications equipment, and chemical equipment, including diesel engines.

This year, Shanghai's exports included complete sets of light industrial equipment for the first time. After a set of undershirt fabric knitting machines including bleaching and dyeing equipment ordered by Indonesia and a portion of the 30,000-spindle cotton spinning equipment purchased by Egypt were shipped, a complete set of soap-making machines purchased by Burma were then shipped.

Starting from the second quarter of this year, the export volume of Shanghai's heavy industrial machinery and tools has increased month by month. The exports include various electrical equipment, twenty-one kinds of tools, including pipe threading dies and screw threading dies that had to be imported five years ago, and six kinds of metal cutting machine tools such as grinders and planers.

Radios, which China had always relied on imports for since 1922, have been exported in large quantities from Shanghai this year, with the variety increasing from three to fourteen.

The domestic instrument industry, which could only undertake repair tasks before liberation, has manufactured analytical balances with sensitivities of 1/10,000 and 1/20,000 and microscopes with magnifications of 1,500 times, which are provided to Shanghai's export departments for export. Automobile tires, which have never been exported in history, have been exported from Shanghai this year, and inquiries and telegrams have been pouring in, with transactions made with ten countries including Romania in Eastern Europe, Finland in Northern Europe, and Burma, Ceylon, and Syria in Asia and Africa.

    对美国“禁运”政策的一个讽刺
    我国自制柴油机出口
    上海许多工业品行销国外
    据新华社上海28日电　当美国至今还把柴油机列为向中国“禁运”的商品之一的时候，中国制造的柴油机却已向埃及和叙利亚出口。今年从上海开出的国际商船，载去了包括柴油机在内的许多种机器、仪表、电讯器材和化工器材。
    今年上海出口的商品中，第一次有了轻工业的成套装备。印度尼西亚订购的包括漂白、染色在内的一套汗衫布针织机和埃及购买的三万纱锭棉纺设备的一部分运出以后，缅甸向我国购买的全套肥皂机接着启运。
    从今年第二季度开始，上海重工业机械和工具的出口量逐月增加。出口的有各种电工设备，包括五年前还需要进口的管子绞板、螺丝绞板在内的二十一种工具，和磨床、刨床等六种金属切削机床。
    1922年以来我国一向依靠进口的收音机，今年已大量从上海出口，品种由三种增加到十四种。
    解放前仅能承担修配任务的国内仪表工业，今年已制造出感量在万分之一和二万分之一的分析天平和千五百倍的显微镜，提供上海出口部门出口。历史上从未出口的汽车轮胎，今年从上海出口以后，要货函电纷来，成交的国家有东欧的罗马尼亚，北欧的芬兰，以及亚非地区的缅甸、锡兰、叙利亚等十个国家。
