　　Cultivating a Technical Workforce from the Working Class
　　National Establishment of One Hundred and Eighty Amateur Universities

　　(Our Report) Amateur higher education has seen significant development nationwide. As of now, the number of amateur universities across the country has grown to 180 (including 87 night schools, 56 correspondence schools, and 37 advanced studies colleges), of which 88 are independently established and 92 are affiliated with regular universities. Classified by school type, there are 91 engineering schools, 11 finance and economics schools, 9 agricultural science schools, 60 teachers colleges, and 9 schools for other disciplines such as literature, science, and political science and law. In 1957, there were a total of 90,000 students enrolled, including approximately 5,000 students in special classes for veteran cadres. Currently, the number of on-the-job cadres, industrial workers with junior and senior high school levels of education, and veteran cadres from agricultural cooperatives who wish to participate in various amateur higher education programs is constantly increasing. Among the newly established amateur universities, such as the Beijing Amateur Power College, the Beijing Amateur Mechanical College, the Beijing Amateur Urban Construction College, the Night School Department of Tsinghua University, and the Night School Department of Tianjin University, all have experienced rapid development in the past year. When the Beijing Amateur Power College opened in the spring of last year, there were only 130 students; now, the number of students has increased to 267, and the number of teachers has also increased from seven to seventeen. The Night School Department of Tsinghua University has seen a sevenfold increase in students in the two years since its founding, and the Night School Department of Tianjin University has also seen a one and a half-fold increase in students in the year since its founding.

　　Currently, these amateur universities, whether independently established by business departments and large-scale factories and mines, or affiliated night school departments and correspondence departments of regular universities, generally employ existing teachers and engineering and technical personnel from the schools to teach part-time, and utilize existing school buildings and teaching equipment for teaching, which is relatively economical in terms of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Some night universities located in industrial and mining areas are able to organize teaching in conjunction with the characteristics and specific conditions of the factories and mines, and save students' study time, which is conducive to ensuring that students study well. The majority of students are also very enthusiastic about learning, and some even squeeze in time for self-study while on business trips, and entrust classmates to copy and send them their lecture notes. In particular, some veteran cadres and industrial workers from worker and peasant backgrounds, some of whom have rich revolutionary experience and some of whom have rich production experience, generally have a strong understanding and a high level of awareness, so they study very hard and make rapid progress. In recent years, many students who have studied at amateur universities have begun to play a significant role in their production and work positions because they have mastered technical knowledge.

　　Based on the current situation, although many achievements have been made in amateur higher education, there are still some problems, such as the lack of guaranteed study time for students, the small number of teachers, the relatively poor teaching quality, and the lack of teaching materials, all of which need to be resolved urgently. It is particularly noteworthy that not enough attention has been paid to how to run special classes for veteran cadres well, and it has not been possible to study and formulate practical teaching plans and teaching methods based on the characteristics of the special class participants. Recently, the Ministry of Higher Education and the educational administrative leadership departments of relevant business departments are working to study the improvement and development of amateur higher education in the future, and are focusing on studying how to run special classes for veteran cadres well, in order to better train enterprise management personnel from worker and peasant backgrounds and the working class's own technical workforce.

　　培养工人阶级的技术队伍
    全国举办业余高等学校一百八十所
    本报讯　全国业余高等教育有了显著的发展。到目前为止，全国业余高等学校已经发展到一百八十所（包括夜校八十七所，函授五十六所，进修学院三十七所），其中独立设置的有八十八所，在高等学校附设的有九十二所。按学校性质分，工科有九十一所，财经十一所，农科九所，师范六十所，其它文、理、政法等科共九所。1957年在校学生共有九万人，其中老干部特别班学生约有五千人。目前要求参加各种业余高等学校学习的在职干部以及具有初、高中程度的产业工人和农业合作社老干部的人数还不断在增加。在新设立的一些业余高等学校中，如北京业余动力学院、北京业余机械学院、北京业余城市建设学院、清华大学夜校部和天津大学夜校部，一年来都得到较快的发展。北京业余动力学院去年春季开办时，学员只有一百三十人，现在学员已增加到二百六十七人，教师也由七人增加到十七人。清华大学夜校部创办二年多，学员已增加到七倍，天津大学夜校部创办一年多，学员也已经增加到一倍半。
    目前，这些业余高等学校，无论是业务部门、大型厂矿企业独立设置的，或是高等学校附设的夜校部、函授部，一般多是聘请学校原有的教师和工程技术人员兼课，并利用原有的校舍、教学设备进行教学工作，因此在人力、物力、财力的使用上是比较经济的。有些设立在工矿区的夜大学，因能结合工矿的特点和具体情况组织教学，又节省学员学习时间，这对保证学员学习好是个有利条件。大多数学员的学习情绪也都很饱满，有些人甚至在出差期间，也挤出时间自习，并委托同学把听课笔记抄寄给他们。特别是一些工农出身的老干部和产业工人，他们有的具有丰富的革命经验，有的具有丰富的生产经验，一般理解力都比较强，觉悟也比较高，因此学习得很努力，进步很快。几年来，已有不少经过业余高等学校学习的学员，由于他们掌握了技术知识，开始在生产工作岗位上发挥了很大的作用。
    根据目前情况来看，在业余高等学校中，虽然已取得了不少的成绩，但是也还存在着一些问题，如学员的学习时间得不到保证，教师数量少，教学质量比较差，教材缺乏等都是急待解决的。特别值得注意的是，对于如何办好老干部特别班还注意得很不够，没有能够很好地根据特别班对象的特点，研究订出切合实际的教学计划和教学方式。最近高等教育部和各有关业务部门的教育行政领导部门，正在着手研究今后业余高等教育的改进和发展，并着重研究如何办好老干部特别班的问题，以更好地培养工农出身的企业管理人员和工人阶级自己的技术队伍。
