　　Qinghai National United Cooperative Reports Double Good News for Highland Barley and Wheat
    Xinhua News Agency, Xining — The Xixing National United Agricultural Cooperative on the Qinghai Plateau has reported a high-yield field of 1,800 jin per mu for highland barley and 1,750 jin per mu for wheat this year.
    The Xixing Cooperative, established last spring, is a united cooperative comprising Mongolian, Tibetan, Han, and Kazakh nationalities. It is located in the suburbs of Chahanwusu Township, Dulan County, in the Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, a small agricultural area with fertile soil surrounded by pastoral areas. This year, the cooperative's average yield per mu reached 462 jin, an increase of 25.2% compared to last year, exceeding the target set for this area in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) by ten years in advance.
    The significant leap in production at the Xixing Cooperative is primarily the result of the united efforts of cooperative members from all ethnic groups over the past two years to implement various measures to increase production. The cooperative's farmland has been largely irrigated, and spring irrigation is also carried out using meltwater before sowing; fertilizer application has been increasing every year, with some fields receiving over 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu this year; seeds are selected through ear selection, block selection, and hand-picking to ensure high-quality seeds. Because of the abundance of weeds near the grassland and the short frost-free period, they pay special attention to weeding and appropriately advancing the sowing period to prevent frost damage and ensure full and plump grains.

### 青海民族联合社青稞小麦报双喜

　　青海民族联合社青稞小麦报双喜
    新华社西宁电　青海高原上的西星民族联合农业社，今年出现了一亩青稞产一千八百斤和一亩小麦产一千七百五十斤的高产田。
    西星社是去年春天建立的一个包括蒙古、藏、汉、哈四个民族的联合社，在海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州都兰县的察汗乌苏镇郊，是一个被牧业区所包围着的土质肥沃的小块农业区。今年这个社平均每亩产量达四百六十二斤，比去年提高了25.2％，提前十年超过了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）对这里的产量要求。
    西星社出现这样大的生产跃进，主要是两年来各族社员团结生产，千方百计推行增产措施的结果。这个社的农田基本上做到了水利化，播种前还利用消冰水进行春灌；肥料年年增加，有的地今年每亩施肥超过万斤；种子是用穗选、块选、拣选挑出来的良种。因为接近草原杂草多，而且无霜期较短，所以他们特别注意拔草和适当地提前播种期，以达到防冻和保证籽肥粒饱的目的。
