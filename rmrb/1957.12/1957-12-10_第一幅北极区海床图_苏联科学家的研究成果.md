　　The First Map of the Arctic Seabed
　　Soviet Scientists' Research Results
    Xinhua News Agency, Leningrad, December 9th: Soviet scientists, based on the latest research results of high-latitude expeditions and drifting ice scientific stations, have concluded that the connection between the Arctic Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean was severed three times in the past 50,000 years. At that time, the warm currents of the Atlantic Ocean stopped flowing into the Arctic Ocean, and the ice from the Arctic Ocean did not flow into the Atlantic Ocean. These phenomena contributed to a general drop in temperature. This is one of the decisive reasons for the formation of Quaternary continental glaciation (the beginning of the Ice Age).
    About ten years ago, a Soviet expedition discovered the Lomonosov Ridge in the Arctic Ocean. Professor Gakkel, who participated in the expedition, believes that the Quaternary glacial and interglacial sediments found on the Lomonosov Ridge are similar to the sediments of modern Asian land.
    After comprehensively studying sediment samples taken from the seabed over many years, Soviet scientists produced the first map of the Arctic seabed. The map uses the Lomonosov Ridge as a boundary, dividing it into two different sedimentary regions—an Atlantic sedimentary region and a Pacific sedimentary region.
    After learning the rate of disintegration of radioactive substances in the laboratory, it is possible to determine the rate at which marine sediments accumulate on the seabed and their absolute age. It has been determined that the seabed surface layer, which is sixty to seventy-five centimeters thick, was deposited on the seabed during the past 50,000 years.

　　第一幅北极区海床图
　　苏联科学家的研究成果
    据新华社9日讯  据塔斯社列宁格勒讯：苏联科学家根据高纬度考察队和浮冰科学站最近的研究结果得出结论说：在最近五万年期间，北冰洋和大西洋的联系曾经三次被隔断。那时，大西洋的暖流曾经停止流入北冰洋，而北冰洋的冰块也不流进大西洋。这些现象曾促使气温普遍下降。这就是形成第四纪陆地冰河作用（冰河时代的开始）的决定性原因之一。
    大约在十年前，苏联考察队在北冰洋发现了洛蒙诺索夫海底山脉。曾经参加考察队工作的加克尔教授认为，在洛蒙诺索夫山脉上找到的第四纪冰川沉积和间冰沉积是和现代亚洲陆地的沉积相似的。
    苏联科学家把多年来从海底取出的沉积物样品进行了全面研究后就制出了第一幅北极区海床图。图上以洛蒙诺索夫海底山脉为界限，划分出两个不同的沉积地区——属大西洋沉积区和属太平洋沉积区。
    在实验室中获知放射性物质的离解速度之后，就可以确定海洋沉积物在海底聚结的速度及其绝对年代。已经查明，厚度为六十到七十五公分的海床表层，是最近五万年期间在海底沉积的。
