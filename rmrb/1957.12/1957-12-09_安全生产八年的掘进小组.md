A tunneling team led by Wang Jinsheng of the Wangfeng Mine, Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, has brilliantly implemented the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical." They have achieved eight years of safe production, eliminating deaths, minor and major work-related injuries, and major liability accidents. They completed the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in August 1956. Wang Jinsheng also motivated two tunneling and mining teams to improve labor organization and increase work efficiency, resulting in a reduction of ninety-eight people. This year, they proposed "six good" competition conditions: good in increasing production and practicing economy, good in safety and quality, good in promoting advanced experiences, good in unity and mutual assistance, good in hygiene and attendance, and good in labor discipline. Not only did they become a "six good" team themselves, but they also motivated teams throughout the mine to actively carry out the "six good" competition. By the third quarter, thirty-seven "six good" teams had emerged throughout the mine. Wang Jinsheng is a delegate to the Eighth National Congress of Trade Unions, as well as a national coal mine labor model and advanced producer. (Attached pictures)

    安全生产八年的掘进小组
    焦作矿务局王封矿王金生领导的掘进小组，出色地贯彻了“又多、又快、又好、又省”的方针。他们已经安全生产了八年，消灭了死亡、轻重工伤和重大责任事故；在1956年8月提前完成第一个五年计划。王金生还带动了掘进回采两组改善劳动组织，提高工作效率，结果减少了九十八个人。今年，他们提出：增产节约好、安全质量好、推广先进经验好、团结互助好、卫生出勤好、劳动纪律好等“六好”的竞赛条件后，不仅自己成为“六好”小组，而且带动全矿小组积极开展了“六好”竞赛，到第三季度，全矿已经出现了三十七个“六好”小组。王金生是出席工会第八次全国代表大会的代表，也是全国煤矿的劳动模范和先进生产者。（附图片）
