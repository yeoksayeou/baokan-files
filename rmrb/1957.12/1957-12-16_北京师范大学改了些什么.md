　　What Changes Have Been Made at Beijing Normal University?
　　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhu Bin
    During the rectification movement, faculty, staff, and students of Beijing Normal University put forward more than 42,000 opinions, and 90% of them have now been addressed. What exactly has the university changed? The reporter visited the university with this question in mind.
    Upon arriving at the school, I saw many short essays in the dazibao (big-character posters), wall newspapers, and school publications, expressing students' gratitude to the cooks for improving the food. One essay was titled: "Breaking with Convention, Boldly Reforming, the Main Canteen's Food Service Takes on a New Look."
    In the past, the food at Beijing Normal University was neither good nor bad, but for a long time, the student canteen only offered two dishes per meal; the variety of dishes in the faculty and staff canteen was also limited, and the prices were very high. Now, students have soybean milk and almond tea for breakfast, and for lunch and dinner, there are four different dishes, two meat and two vegetables, for each meal. The way these dishes are prepared is also different from the past. In the past, dishes were cooked in large pots all at once. Now, large-pot dishes are cooked in batches, making them more delicious. Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, there are also many varieties of staple foods. In the faculty and staff canteen, the prices of rice and dishes have generally decreased by 10% to 20%.
    The improvement of the medical clinic's work is another item that the entire faculty, staff, and students are relatively satisfied with. During the voicing opinions period, people criticized the medical clinic's shortcomings as "two longs and one short": the lines for registration and medicine were long, while the actual time doctors spent diagnosing patients was short, and their attitude towards patients was not very patient. Moreover, it was often difficult to find a doctor at night in case of an emergency. Now, the medical clinic has implemented a three-shift system according to the university's schedule, with most doctors concentrating on seeing patients in the afternoon and evening. It has also implemented an appointment registration system. Doctors and pharmacists have researched and improved medicine dispensing methods, greatly shortening the dispensing time. Now, it only takes a student 45 minutes from registration to receiving medication and injections.
    While improving the living conditions of faculty, staff, and students, Beijing Normal University not only did not increase the state's expenditure, but also launched activities to save grain, water, and electricity and to protect public property. Students also actively participate in various voluntary labor activities.
    According to Sun Wei, the head of the university's General Affairs Office, the masses raised more than 10,000 criticisms and suggestions regarding the administrative and general affairs work. Now, all the opinions that should be adopted and can be adopted have been fully implemented in the work.
    The opinions raised by the faculty, staff, and students regarding teaching work during this voicing opinions period accounted for 35% of all opinions, and there have been relatively significant improvements in this area as well. Each teaching and research group has begun to play its role in teaching. In the past, teachers often used "individual households in a cooperative" to describe their relationship with the teaching and research group. Most teachers did not report their teaching work to the teaching and research group, nor were they subject to collective supervision by the teaching and research group. Now, each teaching and research group implements a collective lesson preparation system. For more important courses, everything from the key content to be taught and the exercises to be assigned to the content for guiding students' extracurricular self-study is carefully studied. In order to leverage collective strength to improve teaching, teachers strictly fill out teaching calendars, attend each other's classes, and observe each other's teaching. Some departments also hold evaluation meetings after observations to summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the lectures.
    Teachers in each department have come up with many ways to improve their teaching effectiveness. Most teachers distribute lecture notes to students before class for students to preview. Physics professors Feng Zhongtai, Li Gongzhe, and others have designed more than a dozen instruments to help students understand the text. Russian lecturers Liu Yan and others have compiled small dictionaries of commonly used vocabulary in class and distributed them to students, reducing the time students spend looking up words during class. For a long time, the quality of various experimental courses has been low. Now, teachers guide students to preview before officially attending the experimental class. Some main lecturers in the biology department also personally host experimental classes.
    Teachers have also greatly strengthened extracurricular tutoring for students. Now, most main lecturers personally answer questions. In the past, teachers rarely graded students' homework. Now, whether it is a math class or a language class, teachers grade the homework of one-third of the students in the class. Teachers in the physics and Russian departments have also organized special groups to guide students' extracurricular activities, cultivate students' ability to make physical instrument models, and improve their ability to use Russian conversation. Teachers in the education department are also often responsible for guiding students to serve as counselors in middle schools. In addition, each department has also assigned special teachers to provide individual tutoring to worker-peasant students and ethnic minority students with relatively low levels of education.
    Some teachers, when talking to reporters about these situations, especially introduced how the party's leading cadres helped the Chinese and biology departments specifically implement the principle of linking theory with practice to improve teaching. In the past, when teaching the class nature and party spirit of literature, teachers in the literary theory teaching and research group of the Chinese department were teaching according to the books, without solving the students' ideological problems. This time, the person in charge of the party committee and party branch studied with the teachers in the literary theory teaching and research group and changed this teaching method. They guided the students to first expose their thoughts, talk freely about their views on the right-wing remarks in literary and art circles, and launched discussions. Finally, they asked the person in charge of the relevant departments of the Central Committee to give a report, correcting many erroneous views among the students. Teachers and students alike felt they had gained a lot.
    In the teaching work of Beijing Normal University, facing middle schools is a main policy, but this policy has not been well implemented in the past. During the rectification and improvement, the person in charge of the party committee and party branch first organized the professors of the biology department to take turns attending the lesson preparation activities of middle school teachers once a week. The professors were very interested in this method of linking theory with practice and felt that their current methods of training future middle school teachers were disconnected from the actual needs of current middle schools. Recently, they have begun to improve teaching based on the information learned from middle schools.
    Improvements in all aspects have encouraged the faculty, staff, and students of the entire school. A student named Duan Yixuan said: "I am so happy now that I can't close my mouth all day long. Take a look: everything is changing rapidly, everywhere is full of new things, and there is also my own strength in it." Gong Zhaoji, a lecturer in the Chinese department, told reporters: "I have been working at Beijing Normal University since 1952, and I have never felt like today that there is organization, order, direction, and purpose everywhere, and that my strength has been fully发挥 [brought into full play]."
    When reporters asked them why they had made so many changes so quickly, teachers, students, and even cooks said in unison: "The leaders are all here! We have more enthusiasm!" Physics professor Feng Zhongtai told reporters: Before this, I didn't even recognize the faces of many of the party committee's leaders. Now they often come to me, and the party secretary even comes to listen to my lectures, which makes me happy and increases my sense of responsibility. Li Gongzhe, another professor in the physics department, also told reporters: I have never felt the party's leadership so 친절하고 [kind and concrete] as today.
    The leadership style of Beijing Normal University has indeed undergone significant changes. When reporters came to the school to conduct interviews, they only found one cadre on duty in the party committee office. All the people in charge had gone to the departments. According to their division of labor, they were studying and solving some pressing problems in the current work together with the masses. Some were listening to lectures with the students; some were studying with the teachers to improve the content of the courses; some were participating in the party and Communist Youth League organizational life of the students; and some were chatting with teachers and students about current events. When I went to the party branches of each department to look for people, I also found only one person on duty in each office. The same was true even in departments such as administration and general affairs.
    When many teachers and students talked to reporters about their assessment of the school's overall rectification achievements, the vast majority expressed satisfaction with the improvement of the leadership cadres' work style and welfare, while believing that the improvement of teaching work was only a beginning. When I bid farewell to the person in charge of the school's party committee, the person repeatedly told reporters: Although we have now handled 90% of the opinions raised by the masses, judging from the nature of the problems, the vast majority are still general problems, and it is only the beginning of a comprehensive improvement in our work. Recently, the school's leaders have begun to focus on going deep into one or two departments to conduct systematic and comprehensive investigations and research on teaching problems, planning to conduct a review of the problems that have been dealt with before the winter vacation, consolidate the work that has been improved, and then concentrate efforts to further solve major teaching problems.

### 北京师范大学改了些什么

　　北京师范大学改了些什么
　　新华社记者　朱彬
    北京师范大学的师生员工在整风运动中提出了四万二千多条意见，现在90％都已作了处理。师大到底改了些什么呢？记者带着这个问题到师大作了访问。
    一到学校就在大字报、壁报栏、校刊上看到了许多学生感谢炊事员改善伙食的短文。有一篇短文的标题是：“打破陈规、大胆改革，大灶伙食工作面目一新。”
    过去师大的伙食虽不好不坏，但长期以来学生食堂每顿只两个菜；教职员工食堂饭菜的花样也不多，而且价钱很贵。现在学生们早餐增加了豆浆、杏仁茶，中午和晚上每餐也都有两荤两素四种不同的菜。这些菜的做法也和过去不一样，过去大锅菜大锅炒，现在大锅菜分多次炒，味道鲜美了。每逢星期二、四、六在主食方面的花样也很多。在教职员工食堂里，饭和菜的价格普遍下降了10％到20％。
    医疗室工作的改进，也是全校师生比较满意的一个项目。人们在鸣放时批评医疗室的缺点为“两长一短”，挂号取药的地方队伍排得长，而大夫诊病的实际时间短，对病人的态度也不很耐心。晚上有了急病，也往往找不到大夫。现在医疗室按照学校作息时间的特点实行了三班制，多数大夫集中在下午和晚上看病，并且实行了预约挂号制，大夫和司药研究改进了配药方法，大大缩短了配药时间。现在一个学生到医疗室看病，从挂号开始到取药打针，整个过程只要四十五分钟。
    师大在改善师生的生活条件的时候，不仅没有增加国家的开支，而且开展了节约粮食、水电和爱护公物的活动。学生们也踊跃参加各种义务劳动。
    据这个学校的总务处长孙伟谈，这次群众对行政总务工作提的批评和建议有一万多条，现在应该采纳而且可以采纳的意见已全部在工作中实现了。
    全校师生在这次鸣放中对教学工作提出的意见占全部意见的35％，在这方面现在也有了比较显著的改进。各个教研组已开始发挥它在教学上的作用了。过去教师们谈起自己和教研组的关系时，常常用合作社里的单干户来打比喻，多数教师不向教研室汇报自己的教学工作，也不受教研室集体监督，现在各个教研组实行了集体备课的制度，对比较重要的课程，从讲授的重点内容、作习题到指导学生课外自学的内容都一一加以研究。为了发挥集体力量改进教学，教师们都严格地填写教学日历，互相听课，互相观摩，有的系在观摩以后还举行评议会来总结讲课的优缺点。
    各个系的教师们想出不少办法提高自己的教学效果。多数教师在上课之前就把讲义发给学生，供学生进行预习。物理系教授冯钟泰、李恭哲等设计了十多种仪器帮助学生理解课文。俄文系的讲师刘彦等人把课堂上常用的词汇编成小词典发给学生，减少学生在听课时查词典的时间。长期以来各种实验课的质量不高，现在在正式上实验课之前，教师们先指导学生进行一次预习。生物系有些主讲教授还亲自主持实验课。
    教师们对学生的课外辅导也大大加强了。现在多数主讲教师都亲自答疑和质疑。过去教师们对学生的课外作业很少批改，现在无论是数学课或语言课，教师们批改的作业都占全班学生人数的三分之一。物理系、俄文系的教师们还组织了指导学生课外活动的专门小组，培养学生制作物理仪器模型，提高运用俄语会话的能力。教育系的教师还经常负责指导学生到中学去担任辅导员的活动，另外，各个系里对原来文化水平比较低的工农学生和少数民族学生，也指定了专门教师在课外进行个别辅导。
    有些教师在和记者谈到这些情况时特别介绍了党的领导干部帮助中文系、生物系具体地贯彻联系实际提高教学的事情。中文系文艺理论教研组的教师们过去在讲授文学的阶级性和党性的课程时，都是按照书本进行贯输，而不解决学生的思想问题。这次党委和党总支的负责人和文艺理论教研组的教师们一起研究改变了这种教学方法，他们引导学生先暴露思想，漫谈回忆对文艺界右派言论的看法，并展开讨论，最后请中央有关部门负责人作报告，纠正了学生中间许多错误观点。教师和学生都感到收获很大。
    在师大的教学工作中，面向中学是一个主要的方针，但这个方针在以往并没有很好地贯彻执行。在整改中，党委和党总支的负责人首先组织生物系的教授们每周一次轮流到中学去参加中学教员的备课活动，教授们对这种理论联系实际的方法很感兴趣，感到自己目前培养未来的中学师资的方法和目前中学的实际需要脱节。最近已根据从中学里了解到的情况开始改进教学。
    各方面的改进，鼓舞了全校的师生。有一个叫段藯萱的学生说：“我现在高兴得一天到晚合不上嘴。看一看：一切都在飞快的变化，到处充满了新鲜的东西，而这里头也有自己的一份力量。”中文系的讲师龚兆吉对记者说：“1952年我就在师大工作，从来没有像今天这样感到到处有组织、有秩序、有方向、有目的，自己的力量充分发挥出来了。”
    当记者和他们谈起为什么改得这样快这样多时，无论教师、学生甚至炊事员都异口同声地说：“领导全下来了！我们的劲头大了！”物理系教授冯钟泰对记者说：在这以前，党委的不少负责人我连他们的面孔都不认识，现在他们常来找我，党委书记还来听我的课，使我又高兴又增加了责任感。物理系的另一位教授李恭哲也对记者说：从来没有像今天这样感到党的领导亲切具体。
    师大的领导作风的确有了显著的改变。记者到这个学校来进行访问时，在党委办公室只找到一个值班的干部，所有的负责人都到系里去了。他们按照分工和群众在一起研究解决当前工作上的一些迫切问题。有的和学生在一起听课；有的在和教师们一起研究改进课程的内容；有的参加了学生的党团组织生活；有的在和师生漫谈时事。我到各个系的党总支去找人时，在各个办公室里同样也只找到了一个值班的。甚至在行政和总务处等部门里也是这种情况。
    不少教师和学生在和记者谈到对全校整改成绩的估计时，绝大多数人都对领导干部的作风、生活福利方面的问题的改进表示满意，而认为教学工作改进还只是开了个头。我在向这个学校的党委负责人告别时，这位负责人也再三对记者说：我们现在虽已处理了群众所提出的意见的90％，但按照问题的性质来说，绝大多数还是一般性的问题，还只是全面改进工作的开始。最近这个学校的领导人已开始有重点地深入到一两个系里，对教学上的问题进行系统全面的调查研究，计划在寒假前就已处理的问题进行一次复查，把已经改进了的工作巩固起来，然后集中力量来进一步解决教学上的重大问题。（本报略加删改）
