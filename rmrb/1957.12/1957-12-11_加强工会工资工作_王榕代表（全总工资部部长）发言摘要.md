Strengthen Trade Union Wage Work
Excerpts from Speech by Representative Wang Rong (Director of the Wage Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions)

Wages are a matter of great concern to the broad masses of workers and their families, and also a major issue related to socialist production and distribution.

In recent years, in accordance with the Party's policy of gradually improving the lives of workers on the basis of developing production and increasing labor productivity, and the principle of distribution according to work, the trade unions have assisted the government and enterprise administrations in carrying out wage reforms nationwide, actively participated in the formulation of wage policies and laws, publicized and explained the Party and state's wage policies to the broad masses of workers, and organized mass supervision of the implementation of labor wage plans and wage policies and laws.

With the tremendous development of China's national economy, the increase in workers' wage levels and the growth of the total wage bill have been quite rapid. In 1956, the average wage of workers nationwide increased by nearly 37% compared to 1952, and it is estimated to increase by 42.8% in 1957 compared to 1952. That is to say, on the basis of overfulfilling the First Five-Year Plan in both industrial and agricultural production and labor productivity, the average wage growth of workers nationwide also exceeded the original plan of 33%. Due to the increase in wage levels, and especially due to the rapid increase in the number of workers, the total wage bill grew even faster, increasing by 1.02 times in 1956 compared to 1952, and is expected to increase by 1.2 times in 1957 compared to 1952. These are unprecedented in the history of old China.

Due to the increase in wages, the stability of prices, and the expansion of labor employment, the lives of Chinese workers have not only greatly improved compared to before liberation, but also the wages of the vast majority of workers have increased considerably compared to before the War of Resistance. In 1956, the average annual wage of workers nationwide reached 610.5 yuan (50.8 yuan per month), and the average annual wage of workers in the central state-owned industrial sector reached 765 yuan (63.75 yuan per month). If each worker's family is calculated on average as 4 people, the average monthly living expenses per person are about 13 to 16 yuan, which guarantees that the broad masses of workers and their families live a life with food and clothing. Many workers not only have food and clothing, but also have savings. In 1956, the savings of urban residents nationwide were three times that of 1952, mainly from workers' savings. The claim that wages have not increased and living standards have not improved after liberation is obviously wrong.

While increasing wage levels, China's wage system has also been continuously improved. We have fundamentally changed the semi-colonial and semi-feudal wage system and established a wage system that basically conforms to the principle of distribution according to work.

The organizational construction of trade union wage work has also developed greatly in recent years. Many wage work cadres have been trained, a large number of activists have been trained, and wage work committees have been established relatively universally in state-owned enterprises and larger joint state-private enterprises, which have done a lot of work and accumulated a lot of experience.

The significant achievements made in wage work in recent years must be affirmed. However, there are still many problems in the current wage work. During this rectification campaign, workers have raised many criticisms and opinions on wage work. The workers' opinions are mainly not about the level of wages. The main issues are: the wage relationships between different types of personnel are not reasonable enough, some wage systems are not practical enough, piecework quotas are sometimes too loose and sometimes too tight, the bonus wage system is somewhat chaotic, the relevant wage regulations are not complete enough, and in particular, the mass line is not sufficiently implemented in wage work. This also reflects that the trade union has shortcomings in this work. The wage work of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is not thorough enough, and there is still a phenomenon of being divorced from reality and the masses, and the Party's labor wage policy has not been studied enough, and there is a lack of regular and specific assistance to provincial, municipal and grassroots trade unions. Through this rectification campaign, we must strive to overcome the shortcomings in our work and improve our work based on the criticisms and suggestions of the workers.

Wage work is an important task of the government and also an important task of the trade union, but there are differences in the working angle and working methods. The trade union mainly carries out its work from the perspective of the masses and using mass working methods. The trade union must go deep into the masses, deep into production, investigate and research, discover problems, reflect and support the reasonable demands of the workers, and actively put forward suggestions to help the Party and the government correctly formulate wage policies and laws. For the wage policies and laws promulgated by the state, and for the already stipulated wage systems, the trade union must conscientiously organize their implementation, help and supervise the enterprise administration to correctly implement them. In the past few years, the trade union leading organs and many grassroots trade unions have conducted investigations and research on the changes in wage levels and the actual effects of various wage systems, analyzed the problems, and put forward suggestions, which have played a great role in improving wage work.

Publicizing the Party and the state's wage policies, strengthening ideological and political education work, raising the workers' awareness, and correctly handling wage issues on the basis of the workers' increased awareness, is one of the important and regular tasks of the trade union. The trade union must regularly publicize and explain the Party and the state's wage policies to the workers, and guide the workers to transform their concern for wages into concern for labor results. It is wrong to ignore the material incentives of wages, but overemphasizing the material incentives and relaxing ideological and political work among workers will foster workers' individualism, departmentalism, and egalitarianism. The trade union should use specific examples to educate the small number of workers who engage in fraud, claim wages under false pretenses, and are preoccupied with personal wage treatment, so that they can recognize and correct their mistakes.

Strengthening mass supervision of wage work is an effective way to attract workers to participate in solving wage issues and improving wage work. The trade union should organize workers to discuss the plans and regulations related to wage adjustments, rely on the strength of activists to check the implementation of wage policies and laws, discover problems, and put forward suggestions for improvement; violations of wage policies and laws and bureaucratic phenomena should be exposed in a timely manner.

Our country's economy is a planned economy, and wage increases are carried out according to plan. Ensuring the correct implementation of the labor wage plan is also one of the important tasks of the trade union. The trade union should regularly check and analyze the use of the wage fund, and based on production needs and the requirements for improving the wage system, help the administration formulate feasible usage plans, submit them to the workers' representative assembly for discussion, make resolutions, and conscientiously implement them. Under the condition that the production and labor productivity growth targets are met, the wage growth plan should also be completed accordingly. The trade union should also assist the administration in taking measures to increase attendance rates, eliminate or reduce overtime work, improve labor organization, streamline personnel, and rationally use the wage fund.

The trade union must treat the workers' appeals and demands related to wage issues seriously, distinguishing between different situations, not being annoyed by trivial matters, not differentiating between large and small matters, and ensuring that everything is accounted for and every matter is resolved.

To further strengthen trade union wage work, the above-mentioned experiences should be well utilized.

Regarding the guidelines and policies for handling labor wage issues in the future, the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has given clear instructions: "China's labor wage and labor insurance welfare policies must proceed from the basic viewpoint of overall consideration of the people's livelihood nationwide, first of all the livelihood of workers and peasants, and appropriate arrangements for urban-rural relations, implement a rational low-wage system, try to ensure that everyone has work to do and food to eat, and gradually improve the lives of workers and peasants on the basis of developing production."

The guidelines and policies for labor wage work put forward by the Third Plenary Session of the Party are completely in line with China's actual situation and also completely in line with the fundamental interests of the working class and the entire laboring people. The task of the trade union is to conscientiously implement this guideline and policy, proceed from the overall actual situation, and assist the government and enterprise administration in further improving the wage system in accordance with the principle of distribution according to work.

In order to implement the Party's labor wage policy, the trade union must publicize and explain to all trade union cadres and the broad masses of workers the principle that everything must proceed from the 600 million people, from developing production, and from consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. Our country is a country with a large population, a poor foundation, and a backward economy, and the wage level of workers must be adapted to the current level of social production and people's lives. Of course, with the development of production, the wage level of workers will still be gradually improved, but the increase in wages must be based on the development of the entire national economy and the improvement of labor productivity of the entire society. This requires our trade union cadres and all workers to have a global perspective, not to look at problems only from the perspective of one enterprise, one region, or one department, and not to simply look at the development of industrial production and the improvement of industrial labor productivity, but to correctly treat the relationship between wages and production from the perspective of overall interests.

In order to implement the Party's labor wage policy, it is also necessary to educate workers to correctly and comprehensively understand the principle of distribution according to work. Distribution according to work is one of the basic principles for determining wage policies in our country. To implement the principle of distribution according to work, it is necessary to oppose both egalitarianism and excessive disparities. There are phenomena in the current wage system that do not conform to the principle of distribution according to work, which must be gradually overcome, but it is also impossible to deviate from the historical conditions and the reality of wages and one-sidedly demand distribution according to work and equal pay for equal work.

The trade union must actively participate in the research and formulation of plans and specific programs for adjusting wages. For this purpose, it is necessary to strengthen investigation and research work. When conducting investigations and research, it is not only necessary to comprehensively and systematically study the current situation of wages, but also to make historical analyses; whenever possible, pay attention to understanding the old Chinese wage system, so as to critically absorb the useful parts of it.

When determining wage levels and improving the wage system, it is also necessary to further improve the wage relationship between new and old workers. In the current wage system, the wages of many old workers who master comprehensive skills are the same or similar to those of young workers who only know simple operations, which is obviously not reasonable enough. Old workers generally have relatively rich production technical experience through long-term production practice training, and most of them are the backbone of production. Their wage treatment should be appropriately higher than that of young workers. In future wage adjustments, appropriate measures should be taken to ensure that the wages of skilled old workers have a greater increase.

Recently, the State Council promulgated four regulations (draft) related to labor wages and labor insurance welfare, among which the apprenticeship system and the provisional regulations (draft) on the wage treatment of ordinary workers and odd-job workers are two important reforms in China's wage system. Extending the apprenticeship period and appropriately reducing the living allowance for apprentices will enable apprentices to learn more skills in a longer period of time, get better training in ideological awareness, and enable more young people to have employment opportunities. Ordinary workers and odd-job workers are the workers who are closest to the peasants in labor. At present, the treatment of this part of the workers is too high, which has to some extent affected urban-rural relations and worker-peasant relations. Therefore, it is appropriate to stipulate their wages by referring to the income of local peasants, plus the difference in urban and rural living expenses. These two regulations are concrete measures to further reflect the basic principle of proceeding from the 600 million people, making overall plans, and making appropriate arrangements. The trade union should conscientiously organize workers to discuss and widely solicit workers' opinions; after the regulations are formally promulgated, it should also actively help the enterprise administration to implement them.

In wage work, it is necessary to earnestly implement the mass line. Plans for adjusting wage standards, improving the wage system, and handling major wage issues, all issues that belong to the national level should be organized for national workers to discuss; local issues should be organized for local workers to discuss; the problems of a factory or mine should be organized for all factory and mine workers to discuss.

Further strengthening the organizational construction of trade union wage work is an important condition for doing a good job in wage work. After the establishment of the workers' representative assembly system in enterprises, the working methods and working systems of the grassroots trade union wage work should also be improved accordingly. Attention should be paid to summarizing and exchanging experiences in this area, and further strengthening trade union wage work.

　　加强工会工资工作
    王榕代表（全总工资部部长）发言摘要
    工资问题，是广大职工和他们的家属最关心的切身利益问题，也是关系社会主义生产和分配的一个重大问题。
    几年来，根据党在发展生产、提高劳动生产率的基础上逐步改善职工生活的方针和按劳付酬的原则，工会协助政府和企业行政在全国范围内进行了工资改革，积极参加了制定工资政策法令的工作，向广大职工群众宣传解释了党和国家的工资政策，并且对劳动工资计划和工资政策法令的执行情况，组织了群众监督。
    随着我国国民经济的巨大发展，职工工资水平的提高和工资总额的增长是相当快的。1956年全国职工的平均工资比1952年提高了将近37％，1957年预计要比1952年提高42.8％。这就是说，在工农业生产和劳动生产率都超额完成第一个五年计划的基础上，全国职工的平均工资的增长也超过了原定33％的计划。由于工资水平的提高，特别是由于职工人数的迅速增加，工资总额增长更快，1956年的工资总额比1952年增长了1.02倍，1957年预计要比1952年增长1.2倍。这些都是旧中国历史上从来没有过的。
    由于工资的提高、物价的稳定和劳动就业面的扩大，我国职工的生活不仅比解放前有了很大的改善，而且绝大多数职工的工资比抗战以前也有了相当的提高。1956年，全国职工的年平均工资达到610.5元（月平均50.8元），中央国营工业部门职工的年平均工资达到765元（月平均63.75元）。如果每个职工的家庭平均按4口人计算，每人每月的生活费平均约为13元到16元，这就保证广大职工群众和他们的家属过着有吃有穿的生活。许多职工不仅有吃有穿，还有剩余。1956年全国城市居民的储蓄额为1952年的三倍，其中主要是职工的储蓄。那种认为解放后工资没有提高、生活没有改善的说法，显然是错误的。
    在提高工资水平的同时，我国工资制度也不断地得到改进。我们已经从根本上改变了半殖民地半封建的工资制度，建立了基本上符合按劳付酬原则的工资制度。
    工会工资工作的组织建设这几年也有很大的发展。培养了许多工资工作干部，训练了大批积极分子，在国营企业和较大的公私合营企业中比较普遍地建立了工资工作委员会，做了很多工作，积累了不少经验。
    几年来，工资工作所取得的重大成绩，是必须肯定的。但是，目前工资工作中还存在不少问题。在这次整风中，职工对工资工作提出了许多批评和意见。职工的意见主要不在于工资水平的高低。主要是：各类人员之间的工资关系不够合理，有些工资制度不够切合实际，计件定额有偏松偏紧的现象，奖励工资制度有些混乱，有关工资的规章制度不够完备，特别是工资工作中贯彻群众路线不够。这也反映了工会在这项工作中有缺点。全国总工会的工资工作是不深入的，还存在着脱离实际、脱离群众的现象，对党的劳动工资政策研究得也不够，对省市和基层工会缺乏经常的、具体的帮助。通过这次整风，我们要努力克服工作中的缺点，并且根据职工的批评和建议，改进我们的工作。
    工资工作是政府的一项重要工作，也是工会的一项重要工作，可是在工作角度上、工作方法上是有区别的。工会主要是从群众的角度、用群众的工作方法来进行工作。工会必须深入群众，深入生产，调查研究，发现问题，反映和支持职工的合理要求，积极地提出建议，帮助党和政府正确地制定工资政策和法令。对国家颁布的工资政策法令，对已经规定的工资制度，工会又必须认真地组织贯彻，帮助和监督企业行政正确地执行。过去几年，工会领导机关和许多基层工会，对于工资水平的变动情况和各种工资制度的实际效果进行了调查研究，分析了问题，提出了建议，对改进工资工作是起了很大作用的。
    宣传党和国家的工资政策，加强思想政治教育工作，提高职工的觉悟，并且在职工觉悟提高的基础上，正确地处理工资问题，这是工会经常的重要任务之一。工会必须经常向职工宣传解释党和国家的工资政策，引导职工把对工资的关心转变成为对劳动成果的关心。忽视工资的物质鼓励作用是不对的，但是过多地强调物质鼓励作用，放松对职工的思想政治工作，就会助长职工的个人主义、本位主义和平均主义思想。对少数职工弄虚作假，冒领工资，斤斤计较个人工资待遇的思想和做法，工会应该通过具体事例，教育他们认识并且改正自己的错误。
    加强对工资工作的群众监督，是吸引职工参加解决工资问题改进工资工作的一种有效方式，工会要组织职工讨论有关调整工资的方案和规定，要依靠积极分子的力量，检查工资政策法令的执行情况，发现问题，提出改进建议；对违反工资政策法令和官僚主义的现象，要及时地加以揭发。
    我们国家的经济是计划经济，工资的增长是按计划进行的。保证劳动工资计划的正确实现，也是工会的重要任务之一。工会应当定期检查和分析工资基金的使用情况，并且根据生产需要和改进工资制度的要求，帮助行政制定切实可行的使用计划，提交职工代表大会讨论，作出决议，认真地贯彻执行。在生产和劳动生产率增长指标完成的条件下，工资增长计划也应当相应地完成。工会还应当协助行政采取措施，提高出勤率，消除或减少加班加点，改善劳动组织，精简人员，合理地使用工资基金。
    对职工有关工资问题的申诉和要求，工会必须分别情况，认真对待，不厌烦琐、不分巨细、做到事事有交代，件件有着落。
    进一步加强工会工资工作，应当很好地运用上述这些经验。
    关于今后处理劳动工资问题的方针政策，党的八届三中全会已有明确指示：“我国劳动工资和劳保福利政策，必须从统筹兼顾全国人民生活首先是工农生活和适当安排城乡关系这个基本观点出发，实行合理的低工资制，尽量使大家都有工作做，都有饭吃，并且在发展生产的基础上，使工农生活能够逐步地得到改善。”
    党的三中全会所提出来的劳动工资工作的方针政策，完全符合我国的实际情况，也完全符合工人阶级和全体劳动人民的根本利益。工会的任务就是要认真贯彻这个方针政策，从全面的实际情况出发，根据按劳付酬的原则，协助政府和企业行政进一步改进工资制度。
    为了贯彻党的劳动工资政策，工会必须向全体工会干部和广大职工群众，宣传解释一切要从六亿人口出发、从发展生产出发、从巩固工农联盟出发的道理，我们国家是一个人口多，底子穷，经济落后的国家，职工的工资水平就必须与社会生产和人民生活的现时水平相适应。当然，随着生产的发展，职工的工资水平仍将逐步提高，但是工资的提高，必须以整个国民经济的发展和全社会的劳动生产率的提高为基础。这就要求我们工会干部和全体职工，具有全局观点，不能只从一个企业、一个地区、一个部门看问题，也不能单纯从工业生产的发展和工业劳动生产率的提高看问题，而必须从整体利益出发，来正确地对待工资与生产的关系。
    为了贯彻党的劳动工资政策，还必须教育职工正确地、全面地认识按劳付酬的原则。按劳付酬是我国确定工资政策的基本原则之一。贯彻按劳付酬的原则，既要反对平均主义，又要反对高低过分悬殊。目前工资制度中不符合按劳付酬的现象是存在的，必须逐步加以克服，但是脱离工资的历史条件和现实状况，片面地要求按劳付酬、同工同酬，也是办不到的。
    工会必须积极参加研究和制定调整工资的规划和具体方案。为此，就必须加强调查研究工作。在调查研究的时候，不仅要全面地系统地研究工资的现状，还要作历史的分析；在可能的条件下，注意了解中国旧有的工资制度，以便批判地吸取其中有用的部分。
    在确定工资水平、改进工资制度的时候，还必须进一步改进新老职工的工资关系。现行工资制度中，不少掌握全面技术的老工人和只会简单操作的青年工人的工资一样或者差不多，这显然是不够合理的。老工人一般地经过长期的生产实践的锻炼，有比较丰富的生产技术经验，大多是生产中的骨干。他们的工资待遇应适当高于青年工人。在今后调整工资时，应当采取适当的办法，使有技术的老工人的工资有较多的增加。
    最近，国务院公布了有关劳动工资和劳保福利的四项规定（草案），其中学徒制度、普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇的暂行规定（草案），是我国工资制度上的两项重要改革。延长学徒的学习期限，适当降低学徒的生活补贴，这就使学徒在较长时期内能够学到更多的本领，在思想意识上得到更好的锻炼，并且使更多的青年有就业机会。普通工和勤杂工是在劳动上同农民最接近的工人。目前这部分工人的待遇偏高，已经在某种程度上影响到城乡关系和工农关系。因此，参照当地农民的收入，加上城乡生活费用的差额来规定他们的工资，这是恰当的。这两个规定，正是进一步体现从六亿人口出发、统筹兼顾、适当安排这一基本方针的具体措施。工会要认真组织职工讨论，广泛听取职工的意见；在规定正式颁布以后，还要积极帮助企业行政贯彻执行。
    在工资工作中，必须切实贯彻群众路线。调整工资标准、改进工资制度，处理重大工资问题的方案，凡属于全国性的问题，应组织全国职工讨论；地方性的问题，应组织当地职工讨论；一个厂矿的问题，应组织全厂矿职工讨论。
    进一步加强工会工资工作的组织建设，是做好工资工作的重要条件。在企业建立了职工代表大会制度以后，基层工会工资工作的工作方法和工作制度也要做相应的改进。应当注意总结和交流这方面的经验，进一步加强工会工资工作。
