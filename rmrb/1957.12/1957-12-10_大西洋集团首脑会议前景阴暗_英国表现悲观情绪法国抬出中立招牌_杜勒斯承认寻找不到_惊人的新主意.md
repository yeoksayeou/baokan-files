Xinhua News Agency Compilation: The upcoming North Atlantic Group summit, scheduled to open in Paris on December 16, is shrouded in gloom. Western European countries are expressing negativity and dissatisfaction with the meeting, and the United States also feels helpless.

According to a United Press International report from London, Britain is now more doubtful and pessimistic about the meeting. British officials even privately suspect that holding the meeting now would do more harm than good.

The UPI report said that the Soviet Union's successful launch of satellites and the failure of the American satellite were a heavy blow to the prestige and leadership of the United States in Britain and other Western European countries. In addition, the following situations are some of the reasons for British pessimism:

	——The United States and Britain have had fierce disputes with France over the issue of transporting weapons to Tunisia.
	——Britain and West Germany are at loggerheads over the maintenance costs of British troops stationed in West Germany.
	——The French are increasingly suspicious that the United States and Britain are seeking to dominate the North Atlantic Alliance at the expense of France and smaller allies.
	——Many smaller North Atlantic allies are unhappy with the US plan to build a series of rocket bases on their territory.

On the French side, the sentiment of dissatisfaction with the United States for engaging in a US-British "duopoly council" within the North Atlantic Group behind its back continues to grow. A statement by a French Foreign Ministry spokesman at a press conference on the 6th reflected this situation, warning that talk of neutralism is currently increasing in France and other North Atlantic Group member states.

The spokesman also stated that the remarks made by French Prime Minister Gaillard at a banquet for the American ambassador on the 4th officially represented the views of the French government. Gaillard mentioned the issue of neutrality in this speech. He was apparently targeting the US-British supply of weapons to Tunisia, demanding that North Atlantic member states conduct "close cooperation" on foreign policy in "areas outside the jurisdiction" of the group.

The spokesman pointed out in this regard: Many people in France and the governments of several North Atlantic Group member states believe that the achievements of the Soviet Union have changed the "entire face" of the North Atlantic Group. They are talking about the possibility of avoiding being drawn into war and mentioning the issue of emulating Switzerland's neutrality. In connection with this, the spokesman said that the governments of certain North Atlantic Group member states oppose the US proposal to establish medium-range ballistic missile bases in Western Europe.

According to a report in the "Express" weekly on the 6th, the French government has formally notified the US government of its decision to manufacture atomic weapons.

A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry once said that France maintains close contact with West Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg in order to formulate "common tasks" related to modern weapons.

The French government is taking these measures to break the US-British atomic monopoly in the Western camp.

At the same time, West German Defense Minister Strauss recently invited Italy to participate in West Germany and France's "technical and military cooperation plan" during a visit to Italy. He said that "military cooperation" between France and West Germany is already underway.

This political climate in Western Europe has made the United States uneasy. American political and press figures believe that all indications show that the United States cannot come up with a "new political idea" that will give the North Atlantic Group "new life and unity." It is expected that any "achievements" of the Paris conference will be almost entirely in the military sphere.

According to the Associated Press, US Secretary of State Dulles had hoped to find some "amazing new idea" to achieve greater "interdependence" among anti-communist allies. However, he finally had to admit that in the current situation, such an idea is impossible.

The key here lies in the irreconcilable contradictions between the United States and its allies. In this regard, the Associated Press pointed out that West Germany had requested that the North Atlantic Group Council be given a limited veto over certain actions of the United States or other member states, and Italy had also requested that the United States join Western European countries in "funding" and "promoting" the "development" of the Middle East and North Africa, but the United States did not agree to do so. Western European countries had requested a say in the issue of conducting nuclear war, but the United States was unwilling to "tie its own hands" in this regard.

The report also said that many officials in Washington believe that some divisions among the North Atlantic allies are probably inevitable due to differing national interests.

　　大西洋集团首脑会议前景阴暗
　　英国表现悲观情绪法国抬出中立招牌
　　杜勒斯承认寻找不到“惊人的新主意”
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：预定12月16日在巴黎开幕的北大西洋集团首脑会议的前景，笼罩着一片暗影。西欧国家对这个会议表示消极和不满，美国也感到无可奈何。
    据合众社伦敦消息报道，目前英国对于这次会议更加怀疑和悲观了。英国负责官员甚至私下怀疑，在现在举行这次会议是否弊多利少。
    合众社消息说，苏联发射卫星的成功和美国卫星的失败，对美国在英国和其他西欧国家的威信和领导来说，是一个沉重的打击。除此以外，以下一些情况也是英国悲观的一些原因：
    ——美国和英国同法国就运送武器给突尼斯问题发生了激烈的争吵。
    ——英国和西德在英国驻西德军队的维持费问题上争持不下。
    ——法国人逐渐疑心，美国和英国谋求在损害法国和较小的盟国的情况下统治北大西洋联盟。
    ——许多较小的北大西洋盟国对于美国要在它们的领土上建立一连串的火箭基地的计划很不高兴。
    在法国方面，不满美国背着它而在北大西洋集团内搞美英“巨头理事会”的情绪在继续滋长。法国外交部发言人6日在记者招待会上的谈话反映了这种情况，他警告说，在法国及其他北大西洋集团成员国里，关于中立主义的谈论目前已经越来越多了。
    发言人还表示，法国总理盖伊阿4日在宴请美国大使时发表的谈话是正式代表法国政府意见的。盖伊阿这次谈话中提到中立问题。他显然是针对美英两国对突尼斯供应武器这件事，要求北大西洋成员国对集团“管辖范围以外的地区”的外交政策进行“密切的配合”。
    发言人就此指出：法国许多人士和北大西洋集团若干成员国政府都认为，苏联的成就已经使北大西洋集团的“整个面貌”发生变化。他们在谈论避免卷入战争的可能性，并且提到仿效瑞士保持中立的问题。联系这一点，发言人说，某些北大西洋集团成员国政府反对美国关于在西欧建立中程弹道导弹基地的建议。
    据“快报”周刊6日报道，法国政府已经正式通知美国政府，它决定制造原子武器。
    法国外交部的一个发言人曾经说，法国同西德、意大利和荷、比、卢国家保持着密切的联系，以便制定有关现代武器的“共同任务”。
    法国政府采取这些措施是为了要打破美英在西方阵营的原子垄断地位。
    与此同时，西德国防部长施特劳斯最近在意大利访问期间曾经邀请意大利参加西德和法国的“技术和军事合作的计划”。他说，法国和西德的“军事合作”已经在进行。
    西欧的这种政治气候已经使美国感到不安。美国政界和新闻界人士认为，种种迹象表明：美国并不能提出使北大西洋集团得到“新的生命和团结”的一种“新的政治主意”。预料巴黎会议如果有“成就”也将几乎完全是在军事方面。
    据美联社报道，美国国务卿杜勒斯本来希望找到某种“惊人的新主意”，以便实现反共盟国之间更大的“相互依赖”。但是，他终于不得不承认，在目前情况下，不可能存在这种主意。
    这里面的关键在于美国同它的盟国有不可调和的矛盾。在这方面，美联社指出，西德曾经要求给予北大西洋集团理事会对美国或其他成员国的某些行动以有限的否决权，意大利也曾经要求美国同西欧国家一同“资助”和“促进”中东和北非的“发展”，但是美国都没有答应这样做。西欧国家曾经要求在进行核战争的问题上有发言权，但是美国不愿意在这方面“捆起自己的手脚”。
    报道又说，华盛顿的许多官员认为，由于国家利益的不同，北大西洋盟国之间的某些分裂大概是不可避免的。
