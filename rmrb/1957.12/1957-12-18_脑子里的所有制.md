Title: The Ownership in the Brain

　　I heard a leading comrade say at a meeting about this issue: the ownership in society has changed, but the ownership in people's minds has not changed, therefore, the socialist transformation cannot be regarded as a complete victory.

　　I think this is very correct. Capitalist ownership has changed, but bourgeois ideology has not changed, so some people engage in underground factories; the private ownership of land in the countryside has changed, but the rich peasant ideology has not changed, so some people still carry out sabotage; as for the bourgeois intellectuals, some of them even want to seize power and restore the capitalist regime.

　　For convenience, let's collectively call this "ownership in the brain" as capitalist ownership.

　　There is another kind. They are workers, but they have all kinds of behaviors that are detrimental to the cause of socialist construction; they are farmers, but they have all kinds of selfish actions that are detrimental to the consolidation of cooperatives; they are intellectuals, although they do not oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and socialism, they are preoccupied with serious personal plans, worrying about gains and losses, and often clash with the collective interests. These various manifestations also stem from the ownership in their minds. Although it is not as vicious as the first type, its nature is similar, so they are connected. Haven't we also seen individual workers steal state materials to participate in underground factories, and individual farmers sabotage the state's unified purchase and sales and cooperatives? Even intellectuals within the Party, like Wang Han, who had twenty-five years of Party membership and had worked in many responsible positions within the Party, did he not become a rightist element who opposed the Party and socialism? This is the result of the malignant development of this ownership. More people retain this "ownership," but have not yet developed to such a malignant degree, but there is a possibility of "development" at any time, because they are connected. In order to distinguish it from the first type, let's call this second type "individualism."

　　The above two types belong to "has not changed yet." There is one type that has changed to "socialist," but there are still small loopholes. Usually, there is no major hindrance, but when the tide is strong, there are some dangerous signs of shaking or collapse; or its surface is covered with capitalist dust, which sometimes confuses people.

　　Of course, there are also people who have a perfect socialist ownership mind. But among the more than 600 million Chinese people, it is still only a small minority.

　　The changed ownership in society is a contradiction with the unchanged ownership in the brain. This contradiction, on the one hand, damages the development of the former, and on the other hand, makes the latter suffer. However, the ownership in society is the determinant, and it refuses to give in to people's minds. When the contradiction is sharp, it will crush the minds that insist on the old ownership. The fate of the rightists can prove this.

　　The ownership in society has definitely changed, and the ownership in the brain must also change with it. But its change is not an easy task, although it is only in a subordinate position to the ownership in society. However, it must change. There is a choice between change and being crushed, but there is no other way to go.

　　So, some people come out to complain and feel unfair: is society really so ruthless? The ownership outside the body has become public, is it necessary to dig out even a little bit left in the brain, and want me to "die for the cause," isn't it too brutal?

　　There is no need to make a fuss about this. For those who hinder it, social history is indeed ruthless, but the so-called "die for the cause" is just a figure of speech; it is not really digging out his liver and brain. In fact, it is to ask him to serve socialism wholeheartedly, which is called "complying with the development of social trends."

　　Changing the ownership is not a bad thing. The change of capitalist factories into socialist factories results in the development of production; the change of private land into cooperatives results in everyone's prosperity. The change of ownership in the brain is also a change from stink to fragrance, from decay to freshness, from reaction to progress, from selfishness to altruism, from shame to glory. It is definitely not emptying the brain, so what is there to be afraid of?

　　Of course, the change (i.e., transformation) is difficult and painful, but it is also a matter of human effort. If one has already recognized that the change is inevitable and is brave enough to change, although one is still far behind the advanced people, because one is moving forward with the trend, one is no longer a resistance to the trend, and can avoid the possibility of being crushed.

　　So I think the key is not the difficulty of the change, but to recognize the inevitability of this change.

### 脑子里的所有制

　　脑子里的所有制
　　阮延顺
    在一个会上听到一位领导同志说过这样一个问题：社会上的所有制变了，可是人们脑子里的所有制还没有变，因此，社会主义改造还不能算是完全的胜利。
    我以为这是十分正确的。资本主义所有制变了，但资产阶级思想没有变，于是便有人搞地下工厂；农村的土地私有制变了，但富农思想没有变，于是便仍然有人进行破坏；至于资产阶级的知识分子，其中更有要夺取天下，恢复资本主义政权的人。
    为了便利，统称这“脑子里的所有制”作资本主义所有制吧。
    还有另一种。他们是工人，但却有种种不利于社会主义建设事业的表现；他们是农民，但却有种种不利于合作社巩固的自私行动；他们是知识分子，虽然没有反对共产党领导和社会主义，但却处处有着严重的个人打算，患得患失，时常和集体利益冲突。这种种表现也根源于他们脑子里的所有制。它虽不像第一种那样恶毒，但其性相近，因此便也相通。我们不是也看到有个别工人偷窃了国家材料去参加地下工厂，个别农民破坏国家的统购统销和合作社吗？即是党内的知识分子，像有过二十五年的党龄，作过党内许多负责工作的王翰，不也成了反党反社会主义的右派分子了吗？这便是这种所有制的恶性发展的结果。更多的人保有这种“所有制”，却还没有发展到如此恶性程度，但有着随时随地“发展”的可能，其原因就在于它们相通，为了同第一种区别，把这第二种称作“个人主义”的吧。
    以上这两种，都是属于“还没有变”的。有一种是变成“社会主义”的了，但还有着小小的漏洞，平时虽无大妨碍，一到浪潮冲击得厉害时，便呈现一些动摇或崩裂的险象；或是它的上面蒙有资本主义的灰尘，有时还要迷人眼目。
    当然，具有完美的社会主义所有制头脑的人，也是有的。但在六亿多中国人民中，还只是一个小小的少数。
    已变了的社会上的所有制，同未变的头脑里的所有制，是一种矛盾。这种矛盾，一方面损害着前者的发展，一方面也使后者遭受痛苦。然而社会上的所有制是决定者，它不肯向人们的头脑让步。当矛盾尖锐的时候，它会把坚持旧的所有制的头脑击得粉碎，右派分子们的下场是可以证明的了。
    社会上的所有制是肯定的变了，头脑里的所有制也必定随它改变。但它的改变却也并非一件容易的事，虽然它只不过处于社会上所有制的从属地位。然而非变不可，变同粉碎之间，可任选择，却别无其他道路可走。
    于是，有人出来怨恨和不平了：社会真这样无情吗？身外的所有制已是变成公有了，难道留在头脑里的一点也要挖走，要我“肝脑涂地”，岂不太残暴？
    这是无须大嚷小叫的。对于阻碍它的人来说，社会历史确是无情的，但所谓“肝脑涂地”也者，只是一种形容；并非真的挖出他的肝脑来。其实是要他全心全意为社会主义服务，这就叫“顺乎社会潮流的发展”。
    改变一下所有制并非坏事。资本主义工厂改变成社会主义工厂，结果是生产的发展；私有土地变成合作社，结果是大家富裕。脑子里的所有制的改变，也是由臭变香，由腐朽变新鲜，由反动变进步，由自私变大公，由可耻变光荣。绝非挖空头脑，这又有什么可怕？
    固然，变（即改造）起来有困难，有痛苦，但却也事在人为，倘已认清非变不可，而勇于去变，虽还远远落后于先进的人，但因是随着潮流前进了，便不再是潮流的阻力，即可避免了击碎的可能。
    所以我以为关键不在于变的困难，而在于要认清这变的必然性。
