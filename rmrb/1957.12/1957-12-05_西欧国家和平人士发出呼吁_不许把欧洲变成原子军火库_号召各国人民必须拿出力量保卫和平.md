Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 3rd: Representatives of peace movements from France, Britain, West Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, after holding a meeting in Paris, issued an appeal on December 1st to the public of the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

The appeal pointed out that the NATO Council meeting will discuss proposals to establish atomic bomb storage in Western European countries, set up rocket launch sites, and give the NATO Supreme Command the power to decide on the use of these weapons. If these plans are realized, they will seriously damage the sovereignty of various countries on a number of issues of vital interest and intensify international tensions.

The appeal said that this kind of plan itself contains new and enormous dangers, and it is being put forward at a time when aircraft carrying thermonuclear weapons are constantly circling over Europe. A single accidental event could threaten world peace. Once war breaks out, Europe will inevitably be destroyed.

The appeal pointed out that no government has the right to undertake such obligations in violation of the people's desire for peace.

The appeal called on public opinion in various countries to demand that governments work to ease international tensions, consider limiting armaments and atomic neutralization in the central area of Europe, as well as any proposals acceptable to both East and West, and should not turn Europe into an atomic armory. The appeal called for an immediate cessation of thermonuclear weapons testing, an absolute prohibition on the use of such weapons, an end to the policy of military blocs, and universal disarmament.

The appeal concluded: Everyone is aware of the seriousness of the danger, and the people of all countries must exert their strength to force the realization of peace.

    西欧国家和平人士发出呼吁
    不许把欧洲变成原子军火库
    号召各国人民必须拿出力量保卫和平
    新华社巴黎3日电　法国、英国、西德、比利时、丹麦、希腊、意大利、卢森堡和荷兰各国和平运动代表们在巴黎举行会议后，在12月1日发表了致北大西洋公约组织成员国公众的呼吁书。
    呼吁书指出，北大西洋公约组织理事会会议将讨论在西欧各国建立原子弹储存、设置火箭发射场和让北大西洋公约组织最高统帅部有权决定使用这些武器的建议。假如这些计划实现，将在利害关系重大的若干问题上严重损害各国主权，并使国际紧张局势加剧。
    呼吁书说，这种计划本身包藏着新的巨大的危险，它是在载有热核武器的飞机不停地在欧洲上空盘旋的时候提出的。只要有一个偶发事件，就会威胁世界和平。一旦作战，欧洲就免不了毁灭。
    呼吁书指出：任何政府都无权违背人民的和平意愿承担这类义务。
    呼吁书号召各国舆论，要求政府努力缓和国际紧张局势。考虑限制军备和欧洲中心地带原子中立化以及可能为东西方都接受的任何建议，而不应该把欧洲变成原子军火库。呼吁书要求立即停止热核武器试验并且绝对禁止使用这类武器、终止军事集团政策和普遍裁减军备。
    呼吁书最后说：人人都意识到了危险的严重性，各国人民必须拿出力量来强使实现和平。
