In his speech, Bulganin first expressed his respect on behalf of the Soviet government and the Central Committee of the CPSU to the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation headed by Marshal Peng Dehuai, and through it, to the fraternal Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Bulganin said that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are forever linked by a fraternal alliance and unbreakable friendship. This alliance and friendship also link the Soviet Armed Forces and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We will continue to consolidate this alliance and friendship. While pursuing a peaceful foreign policy, we have not and cannot forget that in the current international situation, we should show a high degree of vigilance, constantly concern ourselves with strengthening our defense capabilities, strengthening our armed forces, and strengthening the militant friendship between our two countries' armies.

Bulganin said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, established thirty years ago, has traveled a glorious path under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. It is one of the important factors ensuring the Chinese people's historical victory over the combined forces of domestic counter-revolutionary forces and foreign interventionists.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the task facing the Chinese People's Liberation Army has been to transform it into a modern army. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has already achieved great success in carrying out this task. We sincerely congratulate these achievements. We wish our friends new and greater achievements in strengthening their national defense capabilities and in building a modern army capable of crushing any enemy and defending peace and the security of the people.

Bulganin finally proposed a toast to the close militant friendship between the armed forces of the Soviet Union and China, to the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, to the Chinese Communist Party and its Central Committee and all members of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party! To the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai, and to the health of Marshal Peng Dehuai and all members of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to the Soviet Union!

In his speech, Marshal Peng Dehuai said that the visit of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to the Soviet Union coincided with the Soviet people's celebration of the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution and the meeting of the Communist and Workers' Parties of sixty-four countries in Moscow. The convening of this meeting and the adoption of the declaration is an event of great significance. It demonstrates the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the world, and is the beginning of a new victory for the world communist cause. We warmly congratulate the success of this meeting and the great contribution of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, headed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to the cause of human progress.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army, like the Soviet Army, is an army led by the Communist Party and loyal to the socialist cause. It will unconditionally support the declaration of the meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties, resolutely strive to enhance the unity of the international working class, to enhance the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to enhance the unity of national liberation forces and democratic forces, to consolidate world lasting peace, and to defend the victory of socialism.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army has always regarded the heroic Soviet Army as a model for its own learning. The Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong constantly teach us to learn from the Soviet Army, to learn all the advanced experiences of the Soviet Army. This wish of ours has been gradually realized through the great assistance of the Soviet people and the Soviet Army. The warm reception we received during this visit once again demonstrated the sincere spirit of the Soviet Army in helping us. On behalf of all members of our delegation, we express our high respect and sincere gratitude to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, the Soviet people, and all comrades of the Soviet Army with a grateful heart.

The friendly visit of our delegation to the Soviet Union is coming to an end soon. In a few days, after visiting the Khabarovsk Military District and the Pacific Fleet, we will leave the great Soviet land. During this visit, you have fully satisfied our desire to learn and enabled us to learn many new knowledge and valuable experience. We sincerely thank Marshal Malinovsky for his kind invitation, and sincerely thank the comrades of the Soviet Ministry of Defense and the comrades of the military districts for their warm reception.

Marshal Peng Dehuai finally proposed a toast to the sincere unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries headed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to the great achievements of the Soviet people in communist construction, to the greater achievements of the glorious Soviet Army in defending the great Soviet state and the cause of world peace, to the fraternal militant friendship between the people and armies of China and the Soviet Union, and to the health of the leaders of the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union, Comrades Khrushchev, Voroshilov, and Bulganin!
