Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch from Bonn: The United States and Britain are fiercely competing for the business of supplying aircraft to the West German Air Force.

The West German Ministry of Defense recently notified the British government that West Germany had abandoned the idea of purchasing the SR.177 jet interceptor from the British Saunders-Roe company. This decision has aroused indignation from the British side. British newspapers pointed out that in order to peddle this aircraft to West Germany, the British Minister of Supply, Jones, visited Bonn in early November to hold special negotiations with West German Defense Minister Strauss. The West German side was “initially extremely interested in this aircraft.”

According to a report in the London "Sunday Telegraph" on the 28th, political figures in London believe that West Germany's sudden change of mind was due to the United States State Department exerting political pressure on West Germany. As a result, Britain's business was squeezed out. At the same time, news from Bonn said that West Germany may make a decision to purchase American aircraft in January next year. The first detachment of interceptors of the new West German Air Force may use American "Starfighter" or "Super Tiger" aircraft.

Britain originally attempted to rely on the principle of "mutual dependence" jointly touted by it and the United States (one of the contents of which is the division of labor in arms production) to share the profits of arms orders. However, West Germany's refusal to purchase aircraft from Britain proves that Britain's plan has failed. The "Times" resentfully pointed out: "The phenomenon that the Federal Defense Forces (West German army) relies on the United States for the supply of most weapons will in all likelihood continue, even though the governments of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries have declared their willingness to divide labor among countries in the production of weapons."

### 美国抢走西德空军订货  英国尝到“互相依赖”的苦酒

    美国抢走西德空军订货
    英国尝到“互相依赖”的苦酒
    新华社29日讯　波恩消息：美国同英国正在激烈地争夺向西德空军供应飞机的买卖。
    西德国防部最近通知英国政府说：西德已经放弃购买英国桑德斯·罗公司的SR一七七式喷气截击机的念头。这一决定引起了英国方面的愤慨。英国报纸指出，为了向西德兜售这种飞机，英国军需供应大臣琼斯在今年11月初曾到波恩同西德国防部长施特劳斯举行过专门的谈判，西德方面“最初对这种飞机极感兴趣”。
    据伦敦“星期电讯报”28日报道，伦敦政界人士认为，西德突然改变主意是由于美国国务院对西德使用了政治压力。结果英国的生意就被挤掉了。同时从波恩传出的消息说，西德可能在明年1月间作出购买美国飞机的决定。新西德空军的截击机第一分遣队可能使用美国的“星式战斗机”或“超级虎式飞机”。
    英国本来企图依靠它同美国共同标榜的“互相依赖”的原则（其中的一个内容就是军火生产的分工）来分享军火定货的利润。但是西德拒绝向英国购买飞机这件事证明英国的打算落空了。“泰晤士报”怨恨地指出：“联邦国防军（西德军队）依靠美国供应大多数武器的现象十之八九将继续保持下去，尽管北大西洋公约组织各国政府已经宣布，愿意在生产武器方面在各国之间进行分工。”
