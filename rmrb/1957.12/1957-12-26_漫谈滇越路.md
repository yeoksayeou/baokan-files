Rambling on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway
By our reporter Zhang Jiechun

After more than a year of hard work by the Railway Corps soldiers, the Bisezhai-Hekou Railway (碧河铁路) has been connected on December 25th. The first passenger train from Kunming arrived in Hekou on the same evening amidst cheers and a chorus of wheels.

The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway runs from Kunming in Yunnan to Haiphong in Vietnam, with a total length of 854 kilometers. The Bisezhai-Hekou Railway is only a part of the domestic section.

The domestic section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is a very interesting railway. Its northern end is Kunming, a city of perennial spring, and its southern end is Hekou, a border town that is like summer all year round. Kunming is a plateau more than 1,800 meters above sea level, while Hekou is a depression only 90 meters above sea level. This railway is only over 460 kilometers long. In a short time, the train can take passengers from the plateau to the depression, from the temperate zone to the tropical zone, and from spring to summer.

But precisely because of this, building this railway was not easy, especially the Bisezhai-Hekou section. The straight-line distance between Bisezhai and Hekou is 130 kilometers, with a height difference of more than 300 meters. It also has to pass through Miladi, which is 1,700 meters above sea level. The entire line is full of high mountains and steep ridges. Although the railway track is only one meter wide, and the width of the roadbed is only three to four meters, the inside of the roadbed often requires cutting into the mountain slope to a height of several meters, and the outside of the roadbed has to be piled with large stones. The slopes are steep, the curves are sharp, and there are many tunnels and bridges. Here, most of the bridges are not used to cross rivers, but to reduce curves. For example, the Baizhai Bridge. The water under the bridge can be waded across, and even in heavy rain, it is only two or three meters deep at most, but because of the curves, the piers are built as high as the Yangtze River Bridge.

This is how this railway was built: After the Sino-French War, French imperialism occupied Vietnam, and then proposed to the Qing government to open Mengzi, Simao, Hekou and other places in Yunnan as commercial ports. Then, it demanded to build a railway from the Vietnamese border to the capital of Yunnan Province in order to facilitate the plunder of our country's resources and implement colonial rule. Construction began in September 1901 and was completed in April 1910. During the nearly ten years of construction, how many Chinese laborers lost their health and lives here! Although the exact figures were impossible to know at the time, the inhuman behavior of French imperialism is unforgettable to anyone who has witnessed it. Here, let's take a look at a passage from the notes of He Zongzhang, a public official sent by the Qing government to the railway company:

"The company... recruits Chinese laborers... The wage is six cents per day, but there is an inevitable problem of progressive discounts. The rest of the labor camp food is provided by the coolies themselves... (Chinese laborers) several or dozens of people form a group, and they set up a shack on the side of the road, leaning three forked wooden strips, covered with grass, lying on the ground, which is very humid, and the stench is suffocating. In addition, they cannot withstand miasma, and within a few days, they die one after another, even to the point where only one or two out of ten can move in each shack. Foreigners hate it when they see it, and regardless of whether they are dead or not, they burn the shack and cover it with soil. Or if they are sick and sit by the roadside, dying, foreigners passing by kick them into the deep ravines..."

It is said that one person died for every section of rail laid. And in the first year of construction, the number of worker deaths reached 70%. In addition, work-related accidents were also very serious. More than 800 people died in the construction of the "Human Character Bridge" alone. Therefore, even He Zongzhang sighed: "Alas, this road is really made of the flesh and blood of our people!"

During the Anti-Japanese War, because Vietnam was occupied by Japan, the Kuomintang destroyed the Bisezhai-Hekou road. In 1951, the People's Government converted the railway roadbed into a highway, and the railway restoration project began in August last year. Although it was a restoration, the difficulties were still not small. The route of this railway was not well chosen in the first place, and the Kuomintang destroyed it badly. Moreover, old steel rails and fishplates from Shanxi and Vietnam were used for repairs (domestic production does not produce this small type of steel rail). In the short 25 kilometers near Majiezi, there are as many as 16 types of steel rails. Transportation is also difficult, and materials are often not supplied in time, and sometimes even eating becomes a problem. The weather is hot and humid, and even in winter, the sun still makes the steel rails and stones unbearably hot. The heroic railway soldiers were not deterred by these difficulties. As long as the materials were supplied, they were guaranteed to complete the project on schedule. When there were difficulties with materials, they found ways to solve them. For example, when repairing the Baizhai Bridge, the five 40-meter-high piers required more than 10,000 poles for the scaffolding alone. There is no wood in the nearby mountains, and it is difficult to transport it from elsewhere. Squad leader Zhao Hongkui came up with the "well-shaped frame" method, which saved more than 9,000 poles. This is slightly more troublesome to operate than using scaffolding, but it guarantees the time.

Now the Bisezhai-Hekou Railway has been completed, and by March next year, cargo through transport will be implemented with Vietnam. Yunnan is still a province with underdeveloped industry, and many industrial products must be supplied by Shanghai, Guangzhou and other places. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation, serious shortages occurred in the provincial market, while goods were piled up at the stations in Guangxi and Guizhou, suffering damage. By next year, this phenomenon will disappear with the implementation of Sino-Vietnamese through transport. Goods from other provinces will be transported by train to Munanguan in Guangxi, and then directly to Yunnan via Vietnam. The transportation cost for cotton cloth from Shanghai to Kunming via the Yunnan-Guizhou Highway is 314 yuan per ton. If it is transported directly by train via Vietnam, it will only cost 182 yuan, a reduction of more than 42%. This will reduce the selling price of cotton cloth by about 2%. For some hardware raw materials, transportation costs can be reduced by 70%, and the selling price can be reduced by 40%. The selling prices of daily necessities will also decrease by 1.7% to 6.5% due to the reduction in transportation costs.

In the past, many local specialties, mountain goods, fat pigs, and grains in the border areas could not be transported out, and the supply of daily necessities needed by the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas was also very difficult. After the opening of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the more than 400 trucks that used to be used exclusively for transporting goods from other provinces can be used to support the border areas. The supply of goods in remote areas will be improved, and more local specialties, mountain goods, medicinal materials, etc. can also be transported out. This year, Yunnan's outbound transportation of materials is only 110,000 tons. Next year, it is expected to reach 250,000 tons. In the past, Yunnan's phosphate fertilizer, asbestos, oils, fat pigs, old wine, non-ferrous metals, etc. were rarely transported out or not transported out at all. Next year, they can be transported out to support national construction.

The Bisezhai-Hekou Railway has been connected, and China and Vietnam will soon implement through transport. China and Vietnam will be closer and more tightly linked.

    漫谈滇越路
    本报记者　章皆淳
    经过铁道兵团的战士们一年多的苦战，碧河铁路（碧色寨到河口）已经在12月25日接轨。昆明发出的第一列客车已在当天傍晚，在欢呼和车轮组成的大合唱中开进了河口。
    滇越铁路从云南的昆明到越南的海防，全线长八百五十四公里，碧河铁路只是国内段的一部分。
    滇越铁路国内段是一条很有趣的铁路，它的北端是四季皆春的昆明，南端是终年如暑的边城河口。昆明是拔海一千八百多公尺的高原，河口是拔海仅九十公尺的洼地。这段铁路只有四百六十多公里，不要多少时间，火车就可以把旅客从高原带到洼地，从温带带到热带，从春天带到夏天。
    但也正因为如此，修筑这条铁路并不是很容易的，尤其是碧河段。碧色寨到河口的直线距离是一百三十公里，两地高低相差三百多公尺，中间又要经过拔海一千七百公尺的弥拉地。沿线尽是高山峻岭。铁路路轨虽只有一公尺宽，路基的宽度也不过三公尺到四公尺，但在路基的里侧往往把山坡辟进几丈高，路基外侧还得用大石块垒着。坡道大，弯道急，隧洞多，桥梁多。桥梁在这里，大部分不是用来跨越河流，而是用来减少弯道。如白寨大桥，桥下的水涉足可过，下暴雨时，最多也不过二、三公尺深，但因为弯道的缘故，桥墩却修得和长江大桥一样高。
    这条铁路是这样修筑起来的：中法战争后，法帝国主义侵占了越南，接着就向清政府提出开云南的蒙自、思茅、河口等地为商埠，再接着又要求自越南边界到云南省城修一条铁路，为的是更便于掠夺我国资源，实行殖民统治。工程于1901年9月动工，至1910年4月修通。在历时将近十年的工程中，有多少中国民工在这里失去了健康，丢掉了生命！虽然确切的数字当时就已无法得知，但法帝国主义那种毫无人性的行为，只要略睹其事的人都是没法忘掉的。这里我们且看清政府派驻铁路公司的公办贺宗章的一段笔记吧：
    “公司……招雇华工，……工价每日六毛，然不免有层递折扣之弊。其余工棚伙食，概由苦力自备。……（华工）数人或数十人为一起，即于路侧搭一窝棚，斜立三叉木条，上复以草，席地而卧，潮湿尤重，秽臭熏蒸。加以不耐烟瘴，到无几日，病亡相继，甚至每棚能行动者十无一二。外人见而恶之，不问已死未死，火焚其棚，随复以土。或病坐路旁，奄奄一息，外人过者，以足踢之深涧……”
    据说，每铺一节钢轨就要死一个人。而开工的第一年中，工人的死亡人数竟达70％。此外，工伤事故也很严重，单修“人字桥”一项工程，就死了八百多人。所以，连贺宗章也发出了这样的叹息：“呜呼，此路实吾国人血肉所造成矣！”
    抗日战争期间，由于越南被日本侵占，国民党把碧河路破坏了。1951年，人民政府把铁路路基改修为公路，去年8月开始了铁路修复工程。虽然是修复，困难仍不小。这条铁路的路线本来就选得不大好，国民党破坏得又厉害，而且又是利用山西和越南各地的旧钢轨旧夹板来修的（国内不生产这种小型的钢轨）。在马街子附近短短的二十五公里内，钢轨竟达十六种之多。运输也很困难，材料时常供应不上，有时甚至连吃饭都成问题。天气又热又闷，就是在冬天，太阳一晒钢轨、石头还是烫得不行。英雄的铁道兵没有被这些困难难住，只要材料供应得上，他们还是保证按期完工。在材料有困难时，他们就想办法。如修白寨大桥时，五个四十公尺高的桥墩，单手脚架就需杆子一万来根。附近山上不出木材，别处运来也很困难。排长赵洪奎就想出了“井字架”的办法，节省了九千多根杆子。这样在操作上比用手脚架稍为麻烦一点，但却保证了时间。
    现在碧河路已经修通了，到明年3月，并将与越南实行货物联运。云南目前还是一个工业不大发达的省份，许多工业品都要靠上海、广州等地供应。在过去，由于交通不便，省内市场上出现了严重的脱销现象，而货物却堆在广西、贵州的车站上受损坏。到明年，这种现象将随着中越联运的实行而绝迹。外省的货物将由火车运到广西睦南关，经越南直接运到云南来。棉布从上海经过滇黔公路运到昆明，运杂费每吨要三百一十四元，经过越南由火车直接运来，只要一百八十二元，降低了42％强。这样就可使棉布的售价降低2％左右。有些五金原料，运费还可以降低70％，售价可降低40％。日用品的售价也将因运费的降低而下降1.7％——6.5％。
    在过去，边疆有许多土特产、山货、肥猪和粮食都运不出来，边疆各族人民所需要的日用百货供应也很困难。滇越铁路通车后，过去专用来运外省货物的四百多辆卡车就可以用来支援边疆了。边远地区的商品供应将有所改善，更多的土特产、山货、药材等等也可以运出来。今年，云南外运的物资仅十一万吨，明年，预计可以达到二十五万吨。过去云南的磷肥、石棉、油脂、肥猪、老酒、有色金属等很少外运或不外运，明年就可以外运，支援国家建设了。
    碧河路已经接轨了，中越两国不久就要实行联运了，中越两国将靠得更紧更牢了。
