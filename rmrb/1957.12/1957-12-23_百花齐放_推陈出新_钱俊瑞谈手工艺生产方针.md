Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: In a speech to the First National Congress of Members of Handicraft Cooperatives on the 21st, Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, proposed that the guiding principle of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Weed Through the Old to Bring Forth the New" should be implemented in handicraft production, and that culture should be promoted within handicraft cooperatives.

Qian Junrui said that handicrafts are an important part of our socialist national new culture, and are also the aspect of our culture and art that is best integrated with the people's lives. To meet the needs of the broad masses of the people, handicraft production must make its products practical, inexpensive, beautiful, diverse in variety, and diverse in design. To achieve this, the guiding principle of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Weed Through the Old to Bring Forth the New" must be implemented.

Qian Junrui pointed out that our handicraft production has a long history and extremely rich and excellent traditions, but it suffered greatly in old China. Since liberation, the Party and the state have adopted the policy of restoring, rescuing, protecting, developing, and improving, and have achieved great results. We should inherit and carry forward such a rich and excellent national heritage, especially the handicraft production of rural areas and fraternal ethnic groups. The viewpoint of belittling national heritage and measuring everything with Western standards is wrong. We should let a hundred flowers bloom for all kinds of good heritages and traditions, not let one flower bloom alone. In the midst of a hundred flowers blooming, we must not stick to conventions and practice conservatism, but must weed through the old to bring forth the new, strive to improve and innovate on the original basis, and at the same time, learn from the excellent arts and crafts of foreign countries to enrich our handicraft production.

Qian Junrui then said that in order to achieve this, we must encourage the improvement of handicraft design work. To improve design work, we must investigate and study the constantly changing and developing needs of the people, combine the experience of veteran craftsmen, and apply modern theories of arts and crafts. Only when these three are combined can handicraft products be diverse in variety, diverse in design, let a hundred flowers bloom, and improve with each passing day.

Qian Junrui also proposed to strengthen scientific research in arts and crafts, and to strive to cultivate successors for handicraft production. To maintain the high reputation that our handicraft products enjoy in the world, and to further consolidate and enhance this reputation to demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system, it is necessary to prevent complacency, arrogance, and passive conservative tendencies.

When discussing the issue of "culture entering the cooperatives," Qian Junrui emphasized that the 20 million handicraft workers across the country must strive to learn culture. He said that if we are to build our country into a strong socialist power, we must have a high level of culture and science and technology. When handicraft workers have culture, they can master more and better skills, constantly improve labor productivity, improve the design of handicraft products, raise socialist consciousness, and play a greater role in building socialism. He spoke about the need to systematically carry out literacy work among handicraft workers.

Qian Junrui pointed out that conducting socialist education among the vast number of handicraft workers is an important issue. Handicraft workers must establish the ideology of loving the country and the cooperatives, running the cooperatives diligently and thriftily, abide by labor discipline, criticize the capitalist ideological tendencies of petty owners, and recognize the faces of individual bad elements.

Qian Junrui said that amateur cultural and artistic activities should be widely carried out in handicraft cooperatives, and healthy recreation and entertainment should be encouraged. The establishment of various cultural and recreational organizations must be based on the characteristics of handicrafts, avoiding extravagance and waste, and not developing in a professional direction.

Qian Junrui finally said that the cultural and educational departments have not paid enough attention to the cultural and educational work of handicraft workers in the past, and should strengthen this aspect of work in the future. He hoped that all handicraft cooperatives and their members, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, would gradually carry out mass cultural and educational work on the basis of developing production, so that the ideological awareness and cultural level of all handicraft workers would be rapidly improved, so that they could better develop handicraft production and play its important role as an assistant to modern large-scale industry.

    百花齐放  推陈出新
    钱俊瑞谈手工艺生产方针
    新华社22日讯  文化部副部长钱俊瑞21日向全国手工业合作社第一次社员代表大会致词中，提出手工艺生产要贯彻“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针，要把文化推向手工业合作社里去。
    钱俊瑞说，手工艺是我国社会主义的民族的新文化的一个重要组成部分，它又是我国文化艺术中同人民生活结合得最好的一项。手工艺生产要适应广大人民群众的需要，就必须使它的产品实用、便宜、美观、品种多、花色多。要做到这些，就必须贯彻“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针。
    钱俊瑞指出，我国手工艺生产有悠久的历史和极其丰富优秀的传统，但是在旧中国却饱受摧残。解放以后，党和国家采取恢复、抢救、保护、发展、提高的方针，收到很大的成效。对于这样丰富、优秀的民族遗产，我们应该继承和发扬，尤其是农村和兄弟民族的工艺生产。那种轻视民族遗产、用西洋标准衡量一切的观点是错误的。对于各种好的遗产和传统，要百花齐放，不是一花独放。在百花齐放中，也不能墨守成规，实行保守主义，必须推陈出新，从原有基础上努力提高、革新，同时要学习外国的优秀工艺美术，以丰富我们的手工艺生产。
    钱俊瑞接着说，为了做到这一点，就要鼓励改进手工艺的设计工作。要改进设计工作，就必须调查研究人民群众的不断变化着发展着的需要，要结合老艺人的经验，还要运用现代工艺美术的理论知识。只有这三者结合起来，才能使手工艺产品品种多，花色多，百花齐放，日新月异。
    钱俊瑞还提出要加强工艺美术的科学研究工作，和努力培养手工艺生产的接班人。要保持我国手工艺产品在世界上所享有的高度荣誉，而且应当更加巩固和提高这种荣誉，从这一方面来显示社会主义制度的优越性，因此必须防止骄傲自满和消极保守的倾向。
    钱俊瑞在谈到“文化入社”这一问题时，他强调指出，全国两千万手工业劳动者，必须努力学习文化。他说，我们要把自己的国家建设成为一个社会主义强国，必须有高度的文化和科学技术水平。手工业劳动者有了文化，才能掌握更多更好的技术，不断提高劳动生产率，改进手工业产品的设计，提高社会主义觉悟，为建设社会主义发挥更大的作用。他讲到了在手工业劳动者中必须有计划地进行扫盲工作。
    钱俊瑞指出，在广大手工业劳动者中进行社会主义教育是一个重要问题。手工业劳动者必须树立起爱国爱社、勤俭办社的思想，遵守劳动纪律，批判那些小业主的资本主义的思想倾向，认清个别坏分子的面目。
    钱俊瑞说，在手工业合作社中应该广泛开展业余文艺活动，提倡正当的消遣娱乐。成立各种文娱组织一定要根据手工业的特点，避免铺张浪费，也不要向职业化方向发展。
    钱俊瑞最后说，文化教育部门过去对手工业者的文化教育工作注意得很不够，今后应加强这方面的工作。他希望所有的手工业合作社和社员，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，在发展生产的基础上，逐步地开展群众性的文化教育工作，使全体手工业者的思想觉悟和文化水平迅速提高，更好地发展手工业生产，发挥它作为现代大工业的助手的重要作用。
