    Sharp Contrast
    In the recent agricultural capital construction in the Yanbei area, a piece of news is spreading everywhere: In the same canal digging and drainage project, one was invested and operated by the state, without mobilizing and relying on the peasants, resulting in high costs, slow progress, and poor quality; the other was run by the peasants themselves, with only a small amount of state subsidies, but achieved very good results.
    This incident occurred in the Sanggan River Irrigation Area of Ying County. Originally, in order to control alkaline land, two drainage canals had been dug in succession from April of last year to now. Among them, the Second Canal started construction first, and the local peasants only sent some old, weak, and disabled people to the canal, resulting in very low labor efficiency. However, in addition to asking the state for wages and land compensation fees, they even wanted the state to pay for stones and sand. The Sanggan River Water Conservancy Bureau, which was responsible for guiding this project, due to an unclear management policy, and the leading cadres also having the idea of simply relying on the state, repeatedly asked the higher authorities for money and grain after the project started, shouted about difficulties, and requested a reduction in tasks, causing state investment to increase again and again, while the completion date was repeatedly delayed. As a result, this canal, which was only twenty li long, cost more than 110,000 yuan and subsidized more than 30,000 jin of grain, taking a full two years to dig, and the project quality was still very poor. Some places accumulated rainwater in the summer. Someone sarcastically said: It's not a drainage canal, but a pool of stagnant water.
    The Third Canal, which runs parallel to the Second Canal, is a different approach. This time, under the guidance of the provincial and special district leadership organs, the project leading unit conducted a survey of labor and grain conditions beforehand, and decided to rely on the peasants to do it. Therefore, targeting the erroneous thinking that many cadres and peasants had at the time, "If the state doesn't pay, we won't work," they raised questions such as whether digging canals for drainage could increase production, who would benefit, and who should be relied on to do it, and launched debates among cadres and peasants, reversing this erroneous thinking. The peasants automatically prepared tools, divided labor, and formed groups without waiting for the superiors to urge them, and when the construction notice came on October 20th, they jumped onto the construction site. Every day, seven or eight hundred people came early and returned late, with few breaks at noon. Red flag labor competitions were also carried out on the construction site, and labor efficiency gradually increased. As a result, it was completed ahead of schedule in only twenty days, and the quality was qualified. The state only spent more than 13,000 yuan in transportation subsidies and bonuses. After the canal was built, the peasants were very concerned, and each township made plans and began regular maintenance work.

    尖锐的对比
    在最近雁北地区农业基本建设中，到处流传着一个新闻：同样挖渠排水工程，一处由国家投资开办，没有发动和依靠农民，结果花钱多，进度慢，质量差；一处由农民自己办，国家只给予少许补助，却得到很好的结果。
    这件事发生在应县桑干河灌溉区。原来，这里为了治理碱地，从去年4月到现在，接连挖了两条排水干渠。其中，第二干渠开工在先，当地农民只派了些老幼残废人上渠，劳动效率很低，可是他们除了向国家要工资、占地赔偿费以外，连石头、沙土也要国家出钱买。负责指导这项工程的桑干河水利管理局，由于治理方针不明确，领导干部也有单纯依靠国家的思想，在工程开工后，一连几次向上级要钱要粮，喊叫困难，要求削减任务，使国家投资一再增加，完工日期却再三拖延。结果，这条不过二十里长的渠道，前后花费了十一万多元，补助粮食三万多斤，整整挖了两年，工程质量还很差，夏季有些地方积存雨水。有人讽刺说：不是排水渠，倒像积水滩。
    和第二干渠并列的第三干渠，却是另一种作法。这次，工程领导单位在省和专署领导机关指导下，事前作了劳力和粮食情况的调查，决定依靠农民来办。于是，便针对当时许多干部和农民存在“国家不出钱，咱就不上工”的错误思想，提出挖渠排水能不能增产，对谁有利，应该依靠谁来办等问题，在干部和农民中展开辩论，扭转了这种错误思想。农民们不等上级催促，就自动筹备工具，分工编组，到10月20日开工通知一来，一跃而上工地。每天七八百人，都是早出晚归，中午少休息，工地上还开展红旗劳动竞赛，劳动效率逐渐提高，结果只用了二十天时间就提前完成了，而且质量合格，国家只花了一万三千多元的运输补助费和奖励费。渠道修成以后，农民们非常关心，各乡都订了计划，开始经常性的养护工作。
