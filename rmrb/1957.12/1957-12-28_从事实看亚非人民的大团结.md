Looking at the Great Solidarity of the Asian and African People from Facts

The Asian-African Solidarity Conference is the largest peaceful solidarity gathering of Asian and African peoples since the Bandung Conference in 1955. Fifty-four countries were originally invited, but due to various reasons, forty-five countries accepted the invitation. Some of these were unable to attend the conference due to obstruction.

Asia is the largest continent in the world in terms of population and land area, and Africa is the second largest continent in terms of land area. The population of Asia is more than 1.48 billion, and the population of Africa is more than 220 million, accounting for more than 55% and 8% of the world's population respectively. The area of Asia is more than 44.2 million square kilometers, accounting for 31.15% of the world's land area, and the area of Africa is more than 29.7 million square kilometers, accounting for 21.02% of the world's total land area.

According to the forty-five countries that accepted the invitation, the Asian-African Solidarity Conference represents the peaceful and united aspirations of more than 1.66 billion people living on approximately 73 million square kilometers of land in Asia and Africa (excluding the population and land area of the European part of the Soviet Union, the same below). Only more than 90 million people living on more than 9 million square kilometers of land in Asia and Africa were unable to express their will at this historic conference due to obstruction. This shows that the vast majority of people living on most of the land in Asia and Africa are uniting to fight for peace and national independence. What a tremendous force this is!

This Asian-African Solidarity Conference symbolizes the great development of friendly unity among the people of Asian and African countries. In April 1955, the Asian Countries Conference was held in New Delhi, the capital of India. This was followed by the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung, Indonesia.

The standing body established by the Asian Countries Conference—the Asian Solidarity Committee—decided to convene this Asian-African Solidarity Conference at the beginning of this year. The countries participating in these conferences have expanded each time, and the momentum has grown stronger each time.

The participating countries in the Asian Countries Conference (non-governmental) included India, Burma, Cambodia, Ceylon, Pakistan, Nepal, China, North Korea, Mongolia, Vietnam, the Soviet Union, Japan, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, a total of sixteen countries. The land area of these countries accounts for nearly 41% of the total land area of Asia and Africa, and the population accounts for more than 70% of the total population of Asia and Africa.

The Bandung Asian-African Conference was attended by twenty-nine countries and regions: Afghanistan, Burma, Cambodia, Ceylon, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, the Gold Coast (i.e., Ghana), India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Jordan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Nepal, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, Turkey, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, South Vietnam, Yemen, and the Philippines. The land and population of these countries account for 43% and 84.5% of the total area and total population of Asia and Africa, respectively.

From the Asian Countries Conference to this Asian-African Solidarity Conference, the countries and regions accepting the invitation to participate increased from sixteen to forty-five, an increase of almost three times, the land area increased by 76%, and the population increased by about 20%. Importantly, among the increased countries and regions, there are fourteen in Asia and seventeen in Africa, most of which are countries and regions that are fighting for independence.

Among the countries and regions participating in this Asian-African Solidarity Conference, there are socialist countries, nationally independent countries, places fighting for national independence, and countries whose governments pursue pro-American policies and participate in military blocs.

There are a total of five socialist countries: the Soviet Union, China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Mongolian People's Republic.

The countries that have already achieved independence include: India, Egypt, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, Syria, Laos, Nepal, Japan, Afghanistan, Thailand, Malaya, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Yemen, Ghana, Sudan, Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Ethiopia, and other twenty-three countries. Most of these countries pursue a policy of peace and neutrality. The people of Egypt and Syria bravely smashed the imperialist military aggression and war plans. The people of Indonesia are fighting to recover West Irian, and the people of India are also striving to recover Goa. Their just struggles have made great contributions to world peace. Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, Ghana, and Malaya gained independence after the Bandung Asian-African Conference, further striking a blow to the colonial system.

Many countries and regions participating in the conference are still under colonial rule and are fighting for national independence and sovereignty. In particular, the anti-colonial struggles of the people of Algeria, Cyprus, Oman, etc. are giving imperialism increasingly greater blows. Such countries and regions also include Palestine, Aden, Kuwait, Bahrain, Madagascar, Senegal, Zanzibar, Somaliland, Kenya, Nyasaland, Nigeria, French Sudan, Chad, Cameroon, Uganda, etc. Representatives from Somaliland, Kenya, and other regions were prohibited from attending the conference by the British colonial authorities, and some representatives from Zanzibar and Uganda were also arrested by the British colonial authorities. This shows how afraid the colonialists are of the peaceful and united aspirations of the Asian and African peoples.

In addition, some of the countries participating in the conference have governments that pursue pro-American policies and participate in American military blocs, such as Thailand, which participates in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and Iran and Iraq, which participate in the Baghdad Pact, as well as Japan, which participates in the American military system through the US-Japan "Security Treaty." However, the attendance of representatives from these countries at this conference shows that the policies implemented by the governments of these countries not only run counter to the policies of the vast majority of Asian and African countries, but also fail to gain the support of their own people.

Among the countries attending the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, the following have established formal diplomatic relations with our country: the Soviet Union, North Korea, Mongolia, Vietnam, India, Burma, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Nepal, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, and Ceylon. The vast majority of other countries and regions have economic cooperation, trade relations, and non-governmental exchanges with our country.

### 从事实看亚非人民的大团结

    从事实看亚非人民的大团结
    亚非团结大会，是1955年万隆会议以来，亚非各国人民规模最大的一次和平团结集会。被邀参加的国家原有五十四个，由于各种原因，接受邀请的国家有四十五个，其中有一部分因受到阻挠，未能参加会议。
    亚洲在人口和土地面积方面是世界最大的洲，非洲在土地面积方面是世界第二大洲。亚洲人口有十四亿八千多万，非洲人口有两亿两千多万，分别占世界人口的55％和8％以上。亚洲面积是四千四百二十多万平方公里，占世界陆地面积31.15％，非洲面积是二千九百七十多万平方公里，占世界陆地总面积的21.02％。
    按照接受邀请的四十五个国家计算，亚非团结大会代表着居住在亚非两洲约七千三百多万平方公里土地上的十六亿六千多万人民的和平和团结愿望（苏联欧洲部分的人口和土地面积除外，下同）。只有居住在亚非两洲的九百多万平方公里土地面积上的九千多万人民，由于受到阻挠而未能对这次历史性会议表达自己的意志。这说明居住在亚非两洲大部土地上的绝大部分人民正在为争取和平、民族独立的事业而团结起来。这是多么巨大的力量！
    这次亚非团结大会，象征着亚非各国人民友好团结的大发展。1955年4月在印度首都新德里举行了亚洲国家会议。接着在印度尼西亚万隆举行了亚非会议。
    亚洲国家会议建立的常设机构——亚洲团结委员会在今年初决定召开这次亚非团结大会。参加这几次会议的国家一次比一次扩大，声势一次比一次浩大。
    亚洲国家会议（民间性）的参加国家有印度、缅甸、柬埔寨、锡兰、巴基斯坦、尼泊尔、中国、朝鲜、蒙古、越南、苏联、日本、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、约旦和埃及十六个国家。这些国家的土地面积共占亚非两洲土地总面积的近41％，人口占亚非两洲人口总数的70％以上。
    万隆亚非会议的参加国家和地区已有二十九个，这些国家是：阿富汗、缅甸、柬埔寨、锡兰、中国、埃及、埃塞俄比亚、黄金海岸（即加纳）、印度、印度尼西亚、伊朗、伊拉克、日本、约旦、老挝、黎巴嫩、利比里亚、利比亚、尼泊尔、巴基斯坦、沙特阿拉伯、苏丹、叙利亚、泰国、土耳其、越南民主共和国、南越、也门和菲律宾。这些国家的土地和人口，分别占亚非两洲总面积和总人口的43％和84.5％。
    由亚洲国家会议到这次亚非团结大会，接受邀请参加的国家和地方，由十六个扩大到四十五个，几乎增加了三倍，土地面积增加76％，人口增加约20％。重要的是，增加的国家和地方中，亚洲有十四个；非洲有十七个，其中大都是正在争取独立斗争的国家和地方。
    参加这次亚非团结大会的国家和地方中，有社会主义国家、民族独立国家、正为民族独立而斗争的地方、以及政府执行亲美政策和参加军事集团的国家。
    社会主义国家共有五个：苏联、中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国、蒙古人民共和国。
    已经取得独立的国家有：印度、埃及、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰、叙利亚、老挝、尼泊尔、日本、阿富汗、泰国、马来亚、黎巴嫩、伊朗、伊拉克、约旦、也门、加纳、苏丹、突尼斯、摩洛哥、利比亚、埃塞俄比亚等二十三个国家。其中大部分国家奉行和平中立政策。埃及和叙利亚人民英勇地粉碎了帝国主义的军事侵略和战争计划。印度尼西亚人民正在为收回西伊里安而斗争，印度人民也在争取收回果阿。它们的正义斗争，对世界和平都作出了巨大的贡献。摩洛哥、苏丹、突尼斯、加纳、马来亚则是在万隆亚非会议后才获得独立的，给了殖民制度以进一步的打击。
    还有许多参加会议的国家和地方仍然处于殖民主义统治之下，正在为民族独立和主权进行着斗争。特别是阿尔及利亚、塞浦路斯、阿曼等人民的反殖民主义斗争，给了帝国主义愈来愈大的打击。这类国家和地方还有巴勒斯坦、亚丁、科威特、巴林岛、马达加斯加、塞内加尔、桑给尔巴、索马利兰、怯尼亚、尼亚萨兰、尼日利亚、法属苏丹、乍得、喀麦隆、乌干达等。索马里兰、怯尼亚等地区的代表曾被英国殖民当局禁止参加会议，桑给尔巴和乌干达的一些代表还被英国殖民当局逮捕。这说明殖民主义者是多么害怕亚非人民的和平和团结愿望。
    此外，有部分参加会议的国家，它们的政府执行着亲美的、参加美国军事集团的政策，如参加东南亚条约集团的泰国和参加巴格达条约的伊朗、伊拉克以及以美日“安全条约”方式参加了美国军事体系的日本。但是这些国家的代表出席这次大会说明这些国家政府执行的政策不但是同广大亚非国家的政策背道而驰，而且也得不到本国人民的支持。
    出席亚非团结大会的国家中，同我国建立了正式外交关系的有：苏联、朝鲜、蒙古、越南、印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、阿富汗、尼泊尔、埃及、叙利亚、也门和锡兰。其他国家和地方绝大部分同我国有经济合作、贸易关系和民间往来。
