Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 21st: The Second Meeting of the First Shanghai Municipal Congress of the Communist Party of China officially opened on the 20th, following a forty-day preparatory meeting. Over 1,400 delegates and observers attended.

    The Municipal Party Committee is determined to "burn itself," and the delegates raised many criticisms of the Municipal Party Committee's leadership shortcomings.
    The preparatory meeting for this congress began on November 1st and concluded on December 9th. The preparatory meeting began when the Shanghai's rectification movement was unfolding on a large scale. The rectification movement in municipal and district-level organizations was successively entering the third stage, focusing on rectification. The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China expressed its determination to "burn itself" and resolutely rectify, calling on the delegates and observers to use socialist democracy, speak out freely, and first offer opinions to the Municipal Party Committee. Subsequently, serious criticism and self-criticism were carried out among the delegates, helping each other with the spirit of socialist revolution, fully promoting democracy, and fully exposing problems before further studying how to rectify them. At the call of the Municipal Party Committee, in the first ten days or so, the delegates put forward many criticisms and suggestions to the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal People's Committee, the responsible cadres of the Municipal Party Committee, and various departments under the Municipal Party Committee. The delegates unanimously agreed that Shanghai's work had implemented the central government's policies and achieved great victories in all aspects. Various indicators for Shanghai's economic and cultural construction stipulated in the country's first five-year plan have been completed and overfulfilled. However, the delegates also sharply criticized the bureaucratic style of leadership cadres of the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal People's Committee, and other levels of leadership cadres, who were not deeply involved with the masses, responsible cadres rarely met with the masses, the organization was huge, and the personnel were bloated, thus detaching from the masses. They also criticized some special phenomena caused by some unreasonable living systems stipulated by municipal-level organizations. The delegates also put forward many criticisms about the Municipal Party Committee's leadership having a tendency to be tight in the beginning and loose later when deploying work, the failure to thoroughly solve problems such as the division of labor between the urban areas and the close cooperation between the various departments and units, the Municipal Party Committee's failure to tightly grasp the leadership of the districts, and especially the lack of vigorous publicity and implementation of the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, and the lack of strict inspection. During the meeting, Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, made another report, accepting the criticisms put forward by everyone on behalf of the Municipal Party Committee, and announced three decisions: responsible cadres of the Municipal Party Committee would regularly go to the grassroots and participate in physical labor, organizations would be streamlined and cadres would be transferred to lower levels, and special privileges would be corrected, expressing the determination to rectify while correcting. The report further enhanced everyone's thinking. Ke Qingshi called on the delegates to muster the energy of the socialist revolution to carry out rectification.

    The delegates made serious criticisms of the serious mistakes of certain leading cadres in the political and legal departments and the Writers Association, as well as those who were politically declining and ideologically moldy.
    The biggest shock and deepest education for the delegates at the preparatory meeting was the exposure and criticism of certain people's words and deeds that deviated from socialism. Many delegates pointed out that Shanghai's political and legal work had achievements, and over the past year, in accordance with the spirit of the central government's instructions, it had also done a lot of work in clearing cases and correcting shortcomings. At the same time, the delegates criticized the lack of investigation and research and the lack of adherence to the mass line in political and legal work, especially criticizing a few leading cadres in the political and legal departments for violating the central government's policy on suppressing counter-revolutionaries, having serious old legal viewpoints, and repeatedly rejecting the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee. In the work of clearing cases, they were boundlessly lenient, only paying attention to checking cases of light sentences for serious crimes, not paying attention to checking cases of light sentences for serious crimes, only caring about checking wrongly judged cases, not paying attention to checking cases of escaped criminals, and emphasizing the criminal motives, consequences, and evidence of counter-revolutionaries and bad elements to the point of being unreasonable. For example, in the case of a rapist, the raped woman and her family admitted it, and there was a doctor's certificate, but the procuratorate insisted on having a witness on the spot, and as a result, the case was not accepted. The delegates also revealed that the Writers Association had not seriously established the leadership of the Party, did not actively implement the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers in literature and art, and that some leaders of the Writers Association had serious individualism and sectarian emotions, and had been disunited for a long time. They put personal interests above the organization, and even sacrificed the interests of the Party to obey personal interests. Their thoughts were seriously corroded by bourgeois ideology. Some people styled themselves as worker-peasant-soldier writers in order to exclude others, and some even developed to the point of losing their position, sympathizing with bourgeois rightists, and following the enemy to attack the Party. The meeting also criticized several people who were politically declining and ideologically "moldy." Their individualism was originally relatively serious, and although they had undergone some transformation, it has now revived, striving for fame and fortune, and pursuing bourgeois life enjoyment. Certain responsible persons of the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China emphasized the so-called "traditional welfare" of the bank and decided without authorization to sell 14,000 pieces of furniture taken over by the branch after liberation to cadres at unreasonably low prices. The forty-two party-member section chiefs and above cadres of the branch alone bought 882 pieces. This kind of illegal and undisciplined behavior that harmed the public and benefited oneself had created a serious phenomenon of special privileges. The people who were criticized at the meeting all made repeated self-criticisms; most of them began to realize their serious mistakes and were determined to return to their original units to make more in-depth self-criticism and criticism.

    A relatively common ideological problem that was exposed at the meeting and could not be ignored was the lack of ideological preparation for the socialist revolution, the lack of revolutionary vigor, and the lack of political enthusiasm. Therefore, in their work, they were satisfied with the status quo, adhered to old ways, lacked sensitivity to new things, and when they encountered difficulties in their work, they were unwilling to use their brains and reached out to their superiors for solutions, lacking a spirit of hard work. The delegates pointed out that those who muddled along, lacked the spirit of revolution to fundamentally improve their work, were political mediocrities, not revolutionaries.

    During the recess, the delegates brought the spirit of the meeting back to promote the rectification movement in their own organizations.
    The rectification movement at this preparatory meeting was combined with the rectification movements in organizations, enterprises, and other units outside the meeting. The meeting played a good role in promoting the city's rectification movement. At present, Shanghai's rectification movement has made new progress, with more than 1.2 million people involved in the movement. More than 500 units at the municipal and district levels have all entered the third stage, focusing on rectification. During the recess, many leading cadres returned to their units to mobilize the masses, bringing the spirit of criticism and self-criticism from the preparatory meeting to the organizations. Some held Party group meetings and Party committee meetings to uncover problems existing in their leadership work and made self-criticisms to the masses, mobilizing the masses to continue to speak out freely. The secretaries of the Municipal Party Committee accepted the criticisms of the masses and also made self-criticisms at the general meeting of all staff members of the Municipal Party Committee, which deeply moved the masses. During the preparatory meeting, the Municipal Party Committee announced three rectification measures, stipulating that every Thursday, all responsible cadres would go to the grassroots and participate in physical labor. In the most recent voluntary labor, the secretaries of the Municipal Party Committee, the deputy mayors, and thousands of cadres organized shock teams to help residents eliminate the four pests. After the Municipal Party Committee decided to transfer 140,000 cadres to lower levels, a revolutionary upsurge of requesting to go to the countryside and mountains was quickly set off throughout the city. In many organizations, the number of people who signed up to apply to go to the countryside and mountains reached more than 90%. Recently, thousands of cadres have been successively transferred to the suburbs to participate in labor training. The special privileges in the lifestyle of leading cadres have been significantly improved. The democratic atmosphere in many organizations is active, and a new atmosphere that has never been seen before has emerged.

    充分展开批评  推动整改运动
    上海市党代表大会预备会议结束
    据新华社上海21日电  中共上海市第一届代表大会第二次会议，经过四十天预备会议以后，20日正式开幕。到会的代表和列席人员共有一千四百多人。
    市委决心引火烧身，代表们对市委领导上的缺点提出很多批评
    这次大会的预备会议从11月1日开始，到12月9日告一段落。预备会议开始的时候，正值上海全市整风运动大规模展开，市、区两级机关的整风运动陆续转入以整改为主的第三阶段。中共上海市委在会议上表明了“引火烧身”、坚决整改的决心，号召到会的代表和列席人员运用社会主义民主，大鸣大放，首先对市委提意见。接着，代表之间也展开了严肃的批评与自我批评，以社会主义革命的精神互相帮助，做到充分发扬民主，把问题充分暴露出来，然后进一步研究如何整改。代表们在市委号召下，开头十多天，对市委、市人民委员会、市委的负责干部以及市委所属各部门提出了许多批评和建议。代表们一致认为，上海的工作是贯彻执行了中央的方针政策的，各方面的工作都取得了伟大的胜利。国家第一个五年计划所规定的上海经济和文化建设的各项指标，已经完成和超额完成。但是代表们同时对市委、市人民委员会领导干部和其它各级领导干部表现出来的不深入群众，负责干部很少同群众见面，机构庞大，人员臃肿等脱离群众的官僚主义作风，以及市级机关规定的某些不合理的生活制度所造成的一些特殊化的现象，提出了尖锐的批评。代表们对市委领导上在部署工作时有前紧后松的现象，对市区分工以及条条块块的密切配合等问题没有彻底解决，市委对区的领导抓得不紧，特别是对勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业的方针宣传和执行不够有劲，检查不严等缺点和错误，也提出了很多批评。会议进行中，中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施又作了一次报告，代表市委接受大家提出的批评，同时宣布市委负责干部定期深入基层和参加体力劳动、紧缩机构下放干部、纠正特殊化等三项决定，表示边整边改的决心。报告进一步提高了大家的思想。柯庆施号召代表们鼓起社会主义革命的干劲来进行整改。
    代表们对政法部门、作家协会某些领导干部的严重错误以及政治上衰退思想上发霉的人作了严肃的批判
    预备会议给代表们震动最大、教育最深的是：对某些人离开社会主义的言行的揭发和批判。许多代表指出，上海的政法工作是有成绩的，一年来根据中央指示的精神在清理案件、纠正缺点方面，也做了很多工作。同时，代表们对政法工作中调查研究、走群众路线不够提出了批评，特别是批评了政法部门少数领导干部违反中央肃反政策，存在严重的旧法观点，又多次拒绝市委指示，在清案工作中宽大无边，只注意检查轻罪重判的案件，不注意检查重罪轻判的案件，只关心检查错判案件，不注意检查漏网案件，对反革命分子、坏分子强调犯罪动机、后果、罪证等等强调到了不近情理的地步。如对一个强奸犯，被强奸的女人和家属都承认了，并有医生证明，检察院却一定要当场见证人，结果没有受理。代表们还揭发了作家协会没有认真地建立起党的领导，不积极贯彻文艺为工农兵服务的方向，作家协会的某些领导人存在严重的个人主义，宗派情绪，长期闹不团结，他们把个人利益放在组织之上，甚至牺牲党的利益来服从个人的利益，思想上受到严重的资产阶级思想的腐蚀，有的人自封为工农兵作家借以排斥别人，有的甚至发展到丧失立场，同资产阶级右派分子共鸣，跟着敌人向党进攻。会上还批判了若干政治上衰退、思想上发了“霉”的人物，他们原来个人主义就比较严重，虽然经过一番改造，但现在又死灰复燃，争名夺利，追求资产阶级的生活享受。人民银行上海分行的某些负责人，强调银行的所谓“传统福利”，擅自决定把分行在解放后接管的一万四千件家具以低到不近情理的价格卖给干部，单是分行四十二个党员处长以上干部，就买了八百八十二件。这种违法乱纪，损公肥己的行为，已经造成了严重的特殊化现象。会上受到批判的人，都作了反复的检查；大部分人对自己的严重错误开始有了认识，决心回到原单位去作更深入的检查和批判。
    会上暴露出来的一个不可忽视的比较普遍的思想问题是，对社会主义革命思想准备不足，缺乏革命朝气，政治热情不高等。因此，在工作上满足现状，因循守旧，对新鲜事物缺乏敏感，工作遇到困难时，自己不肯动脑筋，伸手向上级要办法，缺乏一股干劲。代表们指出，那种得过且过，缺乏用革命精神来从根本上改进工作的劲头的人，是政治上的庸人，而不是革命者。
    休会期间，代表们把会议的精神带回去，推动了本机关的整改运动
    这次预备会议上的整风，同会外机关、企业等单位的整风是互相结合进行的。会议对全市整风运动起了很好的推动作用。目前上海市的整风运动已经有了新的进展，投入运动的人数在一百二十万以上，市、区两级机关五百多个单位，已经全部转入以整改为主的第三阶段。很多领导干部在休会期间，回到本单位发动群众，把预备会议上的批评与自我批评精神带到机关，有的举行了党组会、党委会揭开领导工作中存在的问题，并且向群众作检查，发动群众继续鸣放。市委书记们接受群众的批评，也在市委机关全体工作人员大会上检查了自己，群众深受感动。预备会议期间，市委宣布了三项整改措施，规定每星期四所有负责干部都下基层，参加体力劳动。最近一次义务劳动，市委书记、副市长们和成千干部组织了突击队，帮助居民消灭四害。市委决定下放十四万干部以后，在短短时间内全市掀起了要求下乡上山的革命热潮，许多机关里报名申请下乡上山的人数达到90％以上。最近已有数千干部陆续下放到郊区，参加劳动锻炼。领导干部生活作风上的特殊化，已有显著改进。许多机关民主空气活跃，出现了从未有过的新气象。
