　　On Sunday, I took out the clothes from my trunk one by one, cotton, lined, and single-layered. At the bottom, I found an old grey twill uniform jacket, which the school issued to me when I was a student at Renmin University a few years ago. At that time, the school issued not only single-layered clothes every year, but also cotton clothes and shirts. Over the years, I accumulated half a trunk full.
　　But this old jacket, which was not worn out, reminded me of an incident from fifteen years ago. When I was in the third grade of elementary school, one afternoon, the principal suddenly announced to everyone: "Everyone must make a set of blue uniforms. Those who cannot afford a uniform must at least wear a set of blue clothes, otherwise they will all be expelled..." When I got home from school, I quickly told my mother. My mother thought I was comparing clothes with the children of wealthy families and didn't know that it was not easy for the family to support my schooling. Before I finished speaking, her eyes were filled with tears, and she sobbed, "Child! It is so difficult for the family to buy food and fuel and support you in school. Your father only sends back five yuan every two months, which is used to maintain the life of a large family. We have long run out of food. After begging everywhere, your older brother Bingyu finally borrowed two斗 of white sorghum flour the day before yesterday, which we still have to pay interest on. Besides, you still have old clothes to wear. Your mother didn't ask you to go naked. Why do you still need to make new ones!" I couldn't explain it to my mother any further, so I could only snuggle in her arms in silence, feeling a pang of sadness in my heart.
　　The next morning, Aunt Zhao from next door ran to my house. Before she could even stand still, she said to my mother with distress: "Little San's tuition fees were just scraped together, and now they have to make what... uni... forms. If you don't wear clothes of the same color, you are not allowed to go to school! Heavens! Isn't this deliberately telling poor people to be 'blind' for generations!"
　　When my mother heard this, she understood that this was a new rule in the school, which could not be disobeyed. She hurriedly went to Aunt Sun in the west of the street. Her son had not yet started school, and he happened to have made a blue cloth jacket that year. She agreed to lend it to me first. When I came home from school at noon, my mother seemed to have obtained a treasure. She couldn't even bother to cook, and hugged me tightly in her arms, smiling and saying, "Aunt Sun, in order to prevent you from dropping out of school, agreed to lend you the blue cloth jacket she made for Sun Hai first, plus the old blue trousers you are wearing, isn't that a set?"
　　Aunt Sun's son was three years younger than me. Although he was not short, when I put on his jacket, half of my arms were still exposed. After a few days, those students who could not afford uniforms and could not wear blue clothes were scolded by this dog of a principal: "This bunch of poor ghosts! They are not allowed to enter the school gate again!" I finally borrowed a blue cloth jacket and escaped this disaster of dropping out of school.
　　Today, this old uniform that I wore a few years ago cannot help but evoke painful reveries. I think of the past and look at the present. In the past, I almost couldn't enter the school gate again because I couldn't afford a uniform. After liberation, the Party sent me to university, and not only was the cost of food provided by the state, but also single-layered clothes, cotton clothes, and shirts were issued every year. From the point of view of clothing alone, I deeply feel that today's students get too much and give too little.

    星期天，我把箱子里的衣服，一件件拿了出来，棉的、夹的、单的都有。在底层，翻出我一件灰斜纹制服上衣，这是我几年前在人民大学做学生时，学校发给的。当时每年不仅发单衣，而且也发给棉衣和衬衣。几年下来，就积了半箱子。
    但是这件没有穿破的旧上衣，却使我想起了十五年前的一件往事。我在小学三年级念书的时候，一天下午，校长忽然向大家宣布：“每人都要做一身蓝制服，做不起制服的至少至少也要穿一身蓝衣服，不然一律开除，……”。放学回家，我赶紧告诉妈。妈还以为我在同财主家的孩子比穿戴，不知道家里供我念书不容易。没有等我说完，她眼睛里就滚着盈盈的泪水，呜咽地对我说：“孩子！家里籴吃买烧，供你上学是多不容易，你爸爸两个月才捎来五块钱，维持一大家子生活，早就没有吃粮了，东求西靠，前天才托你秉玉大哥借到二斗白高粮，还要给人家打利息。再说，你现在还有旧衣服穿，妈并没有叫你光着，为什么还要做新的！”我没法向妈再讲明白，只能偎依在妈的怀里一声不响，心里感到一阵酸楚。
    第二天早起，对门赵大嫂就跑到我家，进门脚还没有站稳，就痛心地对妈说：“小三的学费刚刚凑齐，现在又要做什么……制……服，不穿一个颜色的衣服就不准上学！天哪！这不故意叫穷人家祖祖辈辈当‘瞎子’吗！”
    妈一听这话，明白这是学校里的新规矩，拗不得的，就急急忙忙去街西找孙大嫂，他的儿子还没有上学，恰巧那年做了一件蓝布小褂，答应借给我先穿。中午，我放学回来，妈好像得了什么宝贝似的，饭也顾不得做了，紧紧地把我搂在怀里，微笑着说：“孙大嫂为了不使你失学，答应把她给孙海做的蓝布小褂借你先穿，加上你身上穿的那件旧蓝裤子不是一身吗。”
    孙大嫂的儿子比我小三岁，个子长的虽然不算矮，但是，我穿上他的小褂，还要露着半截胳膊。过了几天，做不起制服而又穿不上蓝衣服的同学，被这位狗校长骂了一顿：“这群穷鬼！以后不准再让他们登学校大门！”我总算借到一件蓝布小褂，幸免了这场失学的厄运。
    今天，这件几年前穿剩下的旧制服，不由地引起我沉痛的遐想，我想到过去，看看现在。过去，我因为做不起一件制服，差一点不能再登学校的大门。解放后，党把我送到大学里念书，不仅饭费由国家供给，而且每年还要发给单衣、棉衣和衬衣。就从衣服这一点上，我深深觉得今天的学生，得到的实在太多、而付出的实在太少了。
