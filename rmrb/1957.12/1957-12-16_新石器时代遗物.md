Neolithic Relics

This February, Neolithic relics were discovered in Wangqing County, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province. These relics were found in a deep ditch on the northeastern slope, about three li from Tumen Town, Wangqing County. The ditch is about ten meters long, two meters wide, and one meter deep. The discovered relics include stone tools and pottery shards. The stone tools consist of six types: axes, adzes, knives, arrowheads, spears, and ring-shaped stone tools. One of the ring-shaped stone tools is relatively rare; it is flat and round, with a round hole in the center, and the surrounding area has outward-protruding edges, resembling petals. The pottery includes a small pottery cup and some pottery shards that are brown on the inside and black on the outside. These pottery shards were fired at a relatively high temperature. These discoveries are important materials for studying the Neolithic culture of the Tumen River basin. (Qi)

    新石器时代遗物
    今年2月，在吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区汪清县发现新石器时代的遗物。这些文物是在离汪清县图们镇大约三里多的东北山坡的深沟里被发现的。这条沟长约十公尺，宽约二公尺，深约一公尺。被发现的文物有石器、陶片等。石器有斧、?、刀、镞、矛和环状石器等六种。其中有一件环状石器比较少见，这种石器形体扁圆，中带圆孔，周围有梭角向外凸起，全形像花瓣。陶器有小陶杯一个和一些里面褐色外面黑色的陶片。这些陶片，火候都比较高。这些发现，是研究图们江流域新石器时代文化的重要资料。　（奇）
