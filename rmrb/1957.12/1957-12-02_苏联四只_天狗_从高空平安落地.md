Xinhua News Agency, December 1st — TASS reports: Before the dog "Laika" was launched into the sky with the second artificial satellite, the Soviet Union had sent some dogs to high altitude for testing. So far, the four dogs "Koziavka," "Damka," "Albina," and "Malyshka," who had traveled to high altitude on rockets, are all doing well.

"Albina" and "Damka" were the first living beings to enter an altitude of one hundred kilometers. "Damka" traveled twice to an altitude of two hundred kilometers above the ground. "Malyshka" once made an emergency landing from altitudes of forty-five and eighty kilometers. Careful study showed that the bodies of these four-legged "scouts" suffered no damage upon landing from high altitude.

As a result of these tests, the question of the condition of living organisms under the conditions of space flight can now be answered to a large extent.

　  苏联四只“天狗”从高空平安落地
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社讯：在小狗“莱伊卡”随着第二个人造卫星被发射到天空以前，苏联曾经把一些狗送到高空进行试验。直到目前四只曾经乘坐火箭到高空去的小狗“科佳弗卡”、“达姆卡”、“阿尔宾纳”和“马雷什卡”一直都很好。
    “阿尔宾纳”和“达姆卡”是第一批进入一百公里高空的生物。“达姆卡”曾经两次到过离地二百公里的高空。“马雷什卡”则曾经从四十五公里和八十公里的高空作过紧急降落。经过仔细研究的结果表明，在这些四只脚的“侦察员”从高空着陆的时候，它们的机体丝毫未受到损伤。
    经过这些试验，生物机体在宇宙飞行的条件下情况如何的问题，在很大程度上已可作出回答。
