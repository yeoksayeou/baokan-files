　　Eliminate Waste, Run Schools Thriftily
    Ministry of Higher Education to Take Effective Measures

    The Ministry of Higher Education has conducted preliminary investigations into the wasteful practices exposed in some universities during the Rectification Campaign and plans to propose ways to implement the policy of running schools thriftily to universities nationwide. Currently, universities have included this issue as one of the central aspects of their rectification efforts.

    During this Rectification Campaign, serious wasteful practices in capital construction, financial expenditures, and equipment were revealed in some universities. In capital construction, many schools planned for buildings that were too large, too new, and did not consider China's current economic level. The original old hydraulics laboratory at Tsinghua University could have met the needs of teaching and scientific research with only slight expansion. However, Tsinghua University built a new hydraulics laboratory according to the largest possible development scale, and now only a portion of it is actually used. The classrooms at Beijing Mining College occupy nearly twice the allocated area, meaning each student has two seats. Some schools, under the guise of building professional buildings, inappropriately constructed excessive administrative offices. Some schools that were newly built or relocated prematurely requisitioned land, requisitioned more land than needed, or even requisitioned land that was not used. Nine universities, including Xi'an Jiaotong University, occupied an average of 0.28 mu per person, exceeding the land quota by 1.8 times. Similar situations exist in universities in Beijing, Wuhan, Shanghai, and other places. Currently, universities generally occupy too much administrative office space, and the housing standards for faculty and staff are too high.

    Waste also exists in the instruments and books of some universities due to lax management and a lack of clear inventory. Laboratories do not share resources; departments emphasize exclusive use; instruments are purchased before research topics are determined; and there is a blind pursuit of new, large, numerous, and precise (sophisticated) equipment. Some teaching staff and procurement personnel do not calculate carefully when submitting procurement plans, resulting in incorrect purchases, duplicate purchases, excessive purchases, and indiscriminate purchases, leading to backlogs. According to preliminary inspections at Tsinghua University during the rectification, it is estimated that the backlog of equipment accounts for 10% to 15% of the total investment over the years, and in some laboratories, it is as high as 30% to 40%. In the use of teaching equipment, experimental materials, reagents, and test tubes, there is a lack of necessary systems, resulting in arbitrary damage, loss, and even theft.

    The phenomena of large organizations, multiple layers, uneven workload, and overstaffing in universities, which were exposed during the Rectification Campaign, are also quite common. A considerable amount of school financial expenditure is used for employee benefits. Some service-oriented welfare measures, due to independent operations, self-contained systems, redundant setups, and low utilization rates, are wasteful. In addition, the phenomenon of not cherishing public property, arbitrarily wasting food, water, electricity, coal, and other resources is very serious in schools.

    Since 1953, the state has invested significant human, material, and financial resources to meet the needs of universities in training talent for construction. Investment in supplementing teaching instruments and equipment alone has amounted to more than 320 million yuan. During the First Five-Year Plan, expenditures on higher education reached more than 2.1 billion yuan. However, the spirit of diligence, frugality, hard work, and struggle has not been sufficiently emphasized in universities, and the role of this funding has not been fully realized, which to some extent has fostered the idea that teachers, students, and staff should rely on the public to solve all difficulties.

    After investigating these issues, the Ministry of Higher Education is prepared to take measures to urge universities to earnestly implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift and running schools diligently and thriftily in all aspects. For example, in conjunction with improving leadership methods and work style, strengthening labor discipline, and improving work efficiency, vigorously streamline organizational structures and personnel, and send cadres to participate in labor training. Improve the utilization rate of existing school buildings and reduce administrative office space; organize cooperation between various departments and related schools as much as possible to regulate the use of teaching facilities; in general, no new buildings will be constructed if the existing school buildings can be adjusted to meet the needs; the construction of residential buildings will be strictly controlled except for a portion of single dormitories that must be resolved. Regarding teaching instruments and equipment, after a comprehensive and thorough inventory, all schools are required to formulate necessary specialized custody and borrowing systems, improve management work, formulate operating procedures and security procedures for important equipment, take active measures to improve equipment utilization, vigorously reduce school administrative expenses, and eliminate the phenomenon of blurring the lines between public and private funds in various expense items.

　　杜绝浪费  勤俭办学
    高等教育部准备采取有效措施
    新华社13日讯　高等教育部对部分高等学校在整风运动中揭露出来的浪费现象，初步作了调查研究，准备向全国高等学校，提出如何贯彻勤俭办学的方针问题。目前各高等学校已经把这一问题列为整改工作的中心内容之一。
    在这次整风运动中，部分高等学校在基本建设、财务开支、仪器设备等方面揭露出来的浪费现象很严重。在基本建设方面，不少学校对校舍建筑的规划布局贪大、贪新，不从我国当前的经济水平出发。清华大学原有的旧水利馆，按照最近几年的需要，只需稍加扩充就能满足教学及科学研究的需要。但是清华大学按照最大发展规模建筑了新水利馆，现在实际上只利用一部分。北京矿业学院的教室占用面积几乎超过定额的两倍，等于每个学生占有二个座位。有的学校在建专业大楼的名义下，不适当地盖了过多的行政用房，有些新建或迁建校舍的学校，在征用土地方面有迟用早征，少用多征，甚至征而不用的情况；西安交通大学等九所高等学校，平均每人占地○·二八亩，超过用地定额的一·八倍。北京、武汉、上海等地高等学校也有类似情况。目前高等学校一般行政用房占用过多，教职工居住标准偏高。
    部分高等学校的仪器图书由于管理不严、家底不清，也存在着浪费。各实验室之间互不通有无；各系之间强调专用；科学研究题目未定，就先购置仪器；盲目地追求新、大、多、精（密）。某些教学人员和采购人员在提出采购计划时，不精打细算，因而发生错购、重购、多购、乱购，造成积压。根据清华大学在整改中的初步检查，估计积压设备占历年投资总数的10％到15％，有的实验室高达30％到40％。在教学设备、实验材料、试剂试管等使用方面，由于缺乏必要的制度，存在着任意损坏、丢失，甚至被盗窃的情况。
    在整风中揭发出来的高等学校机构大、层次多、忙闲不均、人浮于事的现象也相当普遍。学校的财务开支有相当一笔数目是用在职工福利方面。有些服务性的生活福利措施，由于各立门户，自成系统，重复设置，利用率很低。此外，学校里不爱护公共财物，任意糟踏粮食、水电、煤炭等现象也很严重。
    1953年以来，国家为了满足高等学校培养建设人材的需要，在人力、物力、财力上投入很大的力量。仅以补充教学仪器设备的投资来说，就有三亿二千多万元；在第一个五年计划内，高等教育经费的开支达二十一亿多元。但是，在高等学校里强调勤俭朴素、艰苦奋斗的精神很不够，没有充分发挥这笔经费的作用，在某种程度上还助长了师生员工一切困难依靠公家解决的思想。
    高等教育部在调查研究这些问题后，已经准备采取措施督促各高等学校从各方面认真贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办学的方针。例如：结合改进领导方法、领导作风、加强劳动纪律、提高工作效率，大力精简机构编制、下放干部参加劳动锻炼。提高现有校舍的利用率，紧缩行政用房；尽可能地组织各专业之间和有关学校之间的协作，调剂使用教学用房；凡是原有校舍能调剂解决的用房，一般不再修建；生活用房除了一部分必须解决的单身宿舍外，一般的要严加控制兴建。在教学仪器设备方面，各校在进行一次全面彻底的清理以后，要求制定出必要的保管专责制和领用借用制度，改进管理工作，对重要的设备，应该制定操作规程和保安规程，并且采取积极措施，提高设备利用率，大力缩减学校的行政费开支，杜绝各项费用开支上的公私不分现象。
