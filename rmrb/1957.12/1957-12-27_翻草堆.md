    Turning Over Haystacks
    Mice like to hide under the haystacks in front of and behind houses to spend the winter. Turning over the haystacks often reveals groups of mice. The 13 members of the Public Security Police Team of Taiping County, Anhui, recently used this method to capture 237 mice in two days.
    When they catch mice, some people hold bamboo brooms and surround the haystack, while others turn over the haystack in the middle. When mice are discovered, the people standing around hit them with their brooms. Most of the mice hide under the haystack, and the more you turn to the bottom, the more there are.

    翻草堆
    老鼠喜欢躲在屋前院后的草堆底下过冬，翻开草堆往往可以发现成群的老鼠。安徽太平县民警队十三人，最近利用这个办法两天内捕获了二百三十七只老鼠。
    他们捕鼠时，一部分人手中拿着竹丝扫帚，把草堆团团围住，另一部分人在中间翻草堆，发现了老鼠，站在周围的人就用扫帚打。老鼠大都躲在草堆底下，愈翻到底层愈多。
