　　The State's Concern for the Livelihood of Workers

　　Labor Insurance and Welfare
    In recent years, the state has allocated large amounts of funds to expand the scope of labor insurance, cultural and educational welfare programs. During the four years from 1953 to 1956, the additional wages (including labor insurance premiums, employee medical expenses, employee cultural and educational expenses, and employee welfare expenses, etc.) actually spent by the state and enterprises totaled 4.39 billion yuan, equivalent to 12.8% of the total wage bill; student grants for employees' children totaled more than 400 million yuan, equivalent to 1.2% of the total wage bill; collective welfare expenses paid from enterprise bonus funds totaled more than 600 million yuan, equivalent to 1.8% of the total wage bill. The number of employees covered by labor insurance nationwide has increased rapidly year by year, from 3.3 million in 1952 to 9.09 million in the first half of 1957; an increase of 5.79 million in five years. The number of people covered by public medical care in state organs and schools has also increased significantly, reaching 6.56 million in 1956, 164.2% of the 1952 figure.

　　Sanatoriums
    In recent years, the sanatoriums run by trade unions have developed greatly. As of the first half of 1957, the number of sanatoriums and rest homes run by trade unions above the grassroots level nationwide had increased from 64 in 1952 to 174; the number of beds had increased from 7,195 in 1952 to 25,472. The number of amateur sanatoriums and rest homes run by grassroots trade union organizations has increased from 1,022 in 1953 to 1,286; the number of beds has increased from 29,563 in 1953 to 38,009. In the past four years, nearly 700,000 employees have received rest or treatment.

　　Hardship Subsidies
    The state has given greater sympathy and care to employees with difficult living conditions. Trade unions have used membership hardship subsidies and enterprise welfare funds to provide long-term and temporary subsidies to employees with special difficulties. From 1956 to the first half of 1957, a total of 1.99 million people received long-term and temporary subsidies; the total amount of subsidies was more than 100 million yuan. In order to promote the spirit of unity and fraternity among the working class, trade unions in various places have also organized the masses to set up various mass mutual aid organizations. By the end of the first half of 1957, 39,666 grassroots organizations had established mutual aid savings committees, with 5.87 million employees participating, more than double the number in 1954. The funds totaled more than 53.42 million yuan. Currently, according to statistics from seven provinces and nineteen cities, there are 8,423 mutual aid savings groups organized by employee families living in concentrated areas, with 130,888 people participating.

　　Protecting Women and Infants
    The Party and the government pay close attention to the special problems of female workers and the welfare of children. In many factories and mines, the use of female workers is prohibited for work that is particularly heavy or detrimental to the reproductive functions of female workers; in general production, some enterprises protect pregnant female workers by improving machinery and equipment, adjusting labor organization, providing breaks during work, reducing workload or changing to lighter work; female workers who need to breastfeed are given a certain amount of breastfeeding time. By the end of 1956, there were 1,541 female worker hygiene rooms. The number of childcare facilities in grassroots organizations is increasing continuously. By the end of 1956, there were 5,775 grassroots nurseries, an increase of more than 4,300 compared with 1952, with more than 184,000 children being cared for, an increase of more than 140,000 compared with 1952. The number of breastfeeding rooms has also increased from 973 in 1953 to 2,471. In addition, relying on the strength of the masses themselves, employee families have set up 1,774 childcare stations and kindergartens, caring for 91,830 children. Trade union organizations are also very concerned about the growth and education of children. The cultural palaces and clubs of trade unions have specially organized various beneficial activities for children. In 1956 alone, more than 17,000 activities such as movies, cultural performances, lectures, and reports were held for children, with more than 9.652 million participants.

　　国家对职工生活的关怀
　　劳保福利
    几年来，国家拨出大批款项扩大了劳动保险、文教福利事业的范围。在1953年到1956年的四年期间，国家和企业实际开支的附加工资（包括劳动保险费、职工医疗费、职工文教费和职工福利费等）共有四十三亿九千多万元，相当于工资总额的12.8％；用于职工子弟的人民助学金共四亿多元，相当于工资总额的1.2％；由企业奖励基金开支的集体福利费共六亿多元，相当于工资总额的1.8％。全国实行劳动保险的职工人数逐年迅速增加，1952年为三百三十万人，到1957年上半年已经增加到九百零九万人；五年来共增加了五百七十九万人。在国家机关和学校实行公费医疗的人数也有很大的增加，1956年已经达到六百五十六万人，为1952年的164.2％。
　　疗养事业
    几年来，工会举办的疗养事业有了很大的发展。截至1957年上半年，全国基层单位以上工会举办的疗养院、休养所已经由1952年的六十四所，增加到一百七十四所；床位数由1952年的七千一百九十五张，增加到二万五千四百七十二张。工会基层组织举办的业余疗养所、休养所，已经由1953年的一千零二十二所，增加到一千二百八十六所；床位数由1953年的二万九千五百六十三张，增加到三万八千零九张。四年来，共有近七十万名职工经过了休养或治疗。
　　困难补助
    国家对生活困难的职工给予了更大的同情和关怀。工会利用会员困难补助费和企业福利基金，对有特殊困难的职工进行了长期和临时的补助。从1956年到1957年上半年，得到长期补助和临时补助的共有一百九十九万人次；补助金额共一亿多元。为了发挥工人阶级的团结友爱精神，各地工会还组织群众举办了各种群众性的互助组织。到1957年上半年末，已经有三万九千六百六十六个基层组织建立了互助储金委员会，参加的职工有五百八十七万人，比1954年增加了一倍多。基金共有五千三百四十二万多元。目前，据七个省、十九个市的统计，集中居住的职工家属组织的互助储金组达八千四百二十三个，有十三万零八百八十八人参加。
　　保护妇婴
    党和政府对女工的特殊问题和儿童福利，给予深切的关怀。在很多厂矿企业里，对特殊繁重或有碍女工生育机能的工作，禁止使用女工；在一般生产中，有些企业对怀孕的女工采用改进机器设备，调整劳动组织，给予工间休息，减轻工作或调换轻工作的办法加以保护；对需要喂乳的女工，给予一定的哺乳时间。女工卫生室到1956年底已经有一千五百四十一个。基层组织中的托儿机构不断增多，到1956年底，基层托儿所共五千七百七十五所，比1952年增加了四千三百多所，受托儿童达十八万四千多人，比1952年增加了十四万多人。哺乳室也由1953年的九百七十三个，增加到二千四百七十一个。此外，还依靠群众自己的力量，由职工家属举办了一千七百七十四个托儿站和幼儿园，收托儿童九万一千八百三十人。工会组织还十分关心儿童的成长和教育。工会的文化宫、俱乐部专门为儿童组织了各种有益的活动。仅1956年一年，为儿童举办的电影、文艺演出、讲演、报告等活动共一万七千多次，参加的人数达九百六十五万二千多人次。
