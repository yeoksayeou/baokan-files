Xinhua News Agency, 30th - According to TASS: The news that American bombers carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs are taking off from British bases for patrol flights has caused unease and protests among the British and French public.

    The British Peace Committee issued a statement on the 28th, demanding that the government change its policy and negotiate the signing of disarmament and peace agreements. The Labour Party's Hounchurch local organization submitted a letter of protest to Prime Minister Macmillan on the 29th. The Aberdeen branch of the Electrical Trades Union passed a resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal of American troops from Britain.

    French people from all walks of life and democratic newspapers believe this is a direct threat to French security.

    "Liberation" wrote that the U.S. Strategic Air Force planes patrolling over our heads could attack distant cities at any time. This puts the countries where American bombers are stationed at risk of retaliatory strikes.

    Xinhua News Agency, 30th - The American "Newsweek" said on the 26th that, according to information it obtained from "the highest authorities," Britain will make a "major concession" to the principle of Western "interdependence" at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in mid-December. Britain will hand over its entire air defense system to the direct control of the Supreme Command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces, headed by U.S. General Norstad.

    Since the end of the U.S.-British Washington talks in October, Macmillan has repeatedly stated that some sovereignty must be sacrificed for the principle of "interdependence."

    英国和法国各界人士
　　抗议美机载运氢弹满天飞
　  英国准备把防空体系交给美国
    据新华社30日讯　据塔斯社讯：载有原子弹和氢弹的美国轰炸机从英国基地起飞做巡逻飞行的消息引起了英国、法国公众的不安和抗议。
    英国和平委员会28日发表声明，要求政府改变政策，进行签订裁军与和平协定的谈判。工党豪恩彻池地方组织29日把一份抗议书交给了麦克米伦首相。电气工业工人工会亚伯丁分会通过了要求美国军队立即从英国撤出的决议。
    法国各界人士和民主报纸认为这是对法国安全的直接威胁。
    “解放报”写道，在我们头上巡逻的美国战略空军飞机随时都可能袭击遥远的城市。这使驻扎着美国轰炸机的国家有受到报复性的打击的危险。
    据新华社30日讯　美国“新闻周刊”26日说，根据它从“最高当局”得来的消息，英国将在12月中旬举行的北大西洋集团政府首脑会议上，为了西方国家“互相依赖”的原则作出“重大让步”。英国将把它整个防空体系交给以美国将军诺斯塔德为首的北大西洋集团军队最高统帅部直接控制。
    自从10月间美英华盛顿会谈结束以来，麦克米伦就曾经一再表示，必须为“互相依赖”原则牺牲一些主权。
