　　What is "Azimuth"? How to Calculate Altitude?
    Question: A recent news report said that on the morning of December 10th, Beijing residents could see the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite at an azimuth of 239 degrees and an altitude of 26 degrees. What is "azimuth"? How is altitude calculated?
  Answer: In astronomy, the position of a star in the sky is represented by angles, called "azimuth." Scientists divide a circle evenly into 360 parts, each called a "degree." The sky is a large circle, so it is also divided into 360 degrees. The "azimuth" used in astronomy is calculated westward from due south. When we face due south, the azimuth is zero degrees; when facing due west, the azimuth is ninety degrees; when facing due north, the azimuth is one hundred and eighty degrees; when facing due east, the azimuth is two hundred and seventy degrees. Thus, it can be known that an azimuth of forty-five degrees refers to due southwest; an azimuth of one hundred degrees refers to west by north ten degrees.
    Altitude refers to how high a star is from the ground. Counting upwards from the ground, the point directly overhead is ninety degrees. When a star is directly in the middle between the ground and overhead, its altitude is forty-five degrees.
    The aforementioned "azimuth of 239 degrees, altitude of 26 degrees" means that on that day, people in Beijing, facing in the direction of northeast by east fourteen degrees, twenty-six degrees above the ground, could see the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite.

### 什么叫“方位角”？高度怎样计算？

　　什么叫“方位角”？高度怎样计算？
    问：最近报上登一条新闻说，12月10日晨北京居民在方位角二百三十九度、高度二十六度的高空可以看见苏联第二颗人造卫星。什么叫“方位角”？高度怎样计算？
  答：天文学上用角度表示某颗星在天空的位置叫“方位角”。科学家把一个圆圈平分成三百六十份，每份叫一“度”；天空是一个大圆圈，因而也分成三百六十度。天文学上所用的“方位角”，是从正南起向西计算。当我们面向正南方时，方位角是零度；面向正西方时，方位角是九十度；面向正北方时，方位角是一百八十度；面向正东方时，方位角是二百七十度。这样就可以知道，方位角四十五度是指正西南方；方位角一百度是指正西偏北十度。
    高度是指某颗星离地面有多高。从地面向上算起，到我们头顶是九十度。当一颗星在地面和我们头顶的正当中时，它的高度就是四十五度。
    上述“方位角二百三十九度、高度二十六度”，就是说北京的人们那一天在面向东北偏东十四度的方向，离地面二十六度，可以看见苏联的第二颗人造卫星。
