Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 7th: The Chinese Red Cross delegation visiting Japan today visited the Committee for the Implementation of Memorial Service for Chinese Martyrs, National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, Japan-China Friendship Association, Japan Peace Liaison Council, and the Japanese Red Cross, and had extensive conversations with their respective leaders.

During the visit to the Committee for the Implementation of Memorial Service, the committee's chairman, Gyojun Otani, explained to the delegation the process by which the Japanese side had collected the remains of Chinese anti-Japanese martyrs and escorted them back to China in the past. He said that Japanese people's organizations, relying entirely on their own strength, have overcome many difficulties in recent years to return the remains of Chinese martyrs to China. The Japanese people regard this action as a repentance for the war and a prayer for peace. We hope to convey this wish of the Japanese people to the Chinese people and contribute to the permanent friendly relations between Japan and China.

Otani said that since July 1953, Japanese people's organizations have returned seven batches of Chinese martyrs' remains to China, and are now preparing to return the eighth batch.

Li Dequan, head of the Chinese delegation, then said in her speech that the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people cannot be separated by any force. This friendly relationship of two thousand years, although isolated for decades by Japanese militarists, is now a thing of the past. What is needed today is everyone's joint efforts to promote friendship. She said that Sino-Japanese friendship is not only a slogan, but has been proven by our actions. The return of the remains of Chinese martyrs by the Japanese side powerfully demonstrates that our friendship is developing and consolidating.

Li Dequan also announced that the Chinese Red Cross has now found another two thousand three hundred and six remains of Japanese people, which will be returned to Japan when there is an opportunity in the future.

Liao Chengzhi, deputy head of the Chinese delegation, also spoke. On behalf of all members of the delegation and especially the families of the martyred Chinese heroes, he expressed his gratitude to the Japanese friends for their friendly actions. He said that the Chinese and Japanese people have opened up a path of friendly exchanges and peaceful coexistence in the past three years, and our common task is to make the even closer friendship between China and Japan a reality as soon as possible.

Finally, Li Dequan, on behalf of the delegation, presented gifts to the Committee for the Implementation of Memorial Service.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 7th: The welcoming committee for the Chinese Red Cross delegation and the All-Japan Buddhist Association held a memorial service this afternoon at Eiheiji Temple in Tokyo for the six thousand eight hundred and thirty Chinese martyrs who died in Japan in the past and have now been identified. All members of the Chinese Red Cross delegation attended the memorial service.

Gyojun Otani, Keibun Nishikawa, Kanzo Uchiyama, Akira Kazami, Shigeho Okamoto and others delivered condolence speeches successively. In their speeches, they unanimously emphasized that it is necessary to strive to realize the friendly relations between Japan and China, maintain world peace, and restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, in order to console the souls of the martyrs.

Li Dequan, head of the Chinese delegation, expressed her gratitude to friends from all walks of life in Japan on behalf of the families of the martyrs and all members of the Chinese delegation.

Finally, Liao Chengzhi, deputy head of the delegation, reported on the situation of the Chinese side's investigation of Japanese remains. Liao Chengzhi then handed over the roster of thirty-two remains with identifiable names to Gyojun Otani on the spot.
