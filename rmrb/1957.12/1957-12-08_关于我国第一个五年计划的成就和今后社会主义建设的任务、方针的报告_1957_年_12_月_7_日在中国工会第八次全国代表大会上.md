Comrades Delegates, Esteemed Guests:

    I am now reporting to you on the achievements of China's first Five-Year Plan and the tasks and guidelines for future socialist construction, and on behalf of the State Council, I extend warm congratulations on the success of the conference.
    Relying on the efforts of the working class and all the people of the country, China's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy has been completed and overfulfilled. In fact, some of the important tasks and key indicators of China's first Five-Year Plan, such as the task of socialist transformation, total industrial output value, total grain output, and railway and highway transportation volume, were completed and overfulfilled a year ahead of schedule in 1956. On the basis of the great development of China's national economy in 1956, new developments were made in 1957, thus ensuring the successful realization of the first Five-Year Plan. According to preliminary estimates, by the end of 1957, the total industrial output value (excluding the output value of handicrafts, the same below) will exceed the Five-Year Plan by about 17%; the total output value of agriculture and sideline industries and the total output of grain and cotton will reach the targets of the Five-Year Plan and slightly exceed them; the freight volume of various modern means of transport will exceed the Five-Year Plan by more than 14%, of which the railway freight volume will exceed 11%; the total investment in capital construction, that is, the total amount of capital construction projects, will exceed the Five-Year Plan by more than 13%, of which industrial capital construction will exceed about 7%, and agricultural, water conservancy, and forestry capital construction will exceed 53.7%, and transport capital construction will exceed 12%; the total number of students at all levels of schools has also overfulfilled the Five-Year Plan.
    Due to the completion and overfulfillment of the vast majority of indicators, the initial foundation for China's socialist industrialization has been laid, and China's agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce have been basically transformed into socialist economy.
    The great achievements we have made during the first Five-Year Plan are first and foremost the decisive victory of the socialist revolution. In 1956, after the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, handicraft cooperativization, and joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce, we basically completed the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production. At the end of 1956, state-owned economy accounted for 65.5% of China's total industrial output value, cooperative economy accounted for 2%, and joint state-private economy accounted for 32.5%. In the total agricultural output value, state-owned economy accounted for slightly more than 1%, cooperative economy accounted for nearly 94%, and individual economy accounted for about 5%. In the total retail sales of commercial institutions, state-owned economy accounted for 38.5%, supply and marketing cooperative economy accounted for 29.9%, joint state-private economy and cooperative economy (small peddlers organized for cooperative operation) accounted for 28.6%, and private economy accounted for 3%. All this proves that China's socialist economic components have established a solid dominant position both in cities and in rural areas, and the capitalist economy has been basically eliminated, and the individual economy has retreated to an insignificant position. That is to say, the socialist economic system has been established in China.
    Following the victory of the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production in 1956, we launched a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts through the great movement of rectification and anti-rightist struggle in 1957, and we also achieved a decisive victory. In this way, China's socialist system has been further consolidated, and no enemy can prevent the Chinese working class from uniting the people of the country and advancing along the socialist road.
    During the first Five-Year Plan period, China's achievements in socialist construction were also enormous, and we have achieved the goals set in the first Five-Year Plan and established the initial foundation for socialist industrialization. The total investment in capital construction in the economic and cultural sectors during the first Five-Year Plan is estimated at 48.49 billion yuan, of which the investment in industrial capital construction is estimated at 27.38 billion yuan. More than 820 capital construction units above the quota started construction, and about 450 of them are expected to be completed by the end of this year, of which 57 belong to the 156 projects designed with the assistance of the Soviet Union (in addition, there are 10 projects that have been partially completed and put into production); more than 2,300 construction units below the quota are planned, and many have been added in the implementation of the plan, and most of them can be completed by the end of this year. Due to the completion of the above-mentioned construction, the total amount of fixed assets of China's industry in 1957 will increase by more than one time compared with 1952. The large-scale industrial capital construction has not only greatly increased the industrial production capacity, but also established a series of new industrial sectors, changing the weak, incomplete, and uncoordinated state of the industrial base caused by China in the past colonial and semi-colonial periods, making China a country with aircraft manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, high-efficiency steam locomotive manufacturing, new-style machine tool manufacturing, power generation equipment manufacturing, metallurgical and mining equipment manufacturing, and high-grade alloy steel and important non-ferrous metal smelting industries. China's northeastern industrial base, centered on Anshan Iron and Steel, has been basically completed, the industrial base of Shanghai and other coastal cities has also been greatly strengthened, and new industrial zones are being formed in North China, Central China, and Northwest China, and partial industrial construction has begun in Southwest China and South China. While carrying out large-scale new industrial construction during the first five years, the production capacity of China's original industrial enterprises has also been greatly developed, so that China's total industrial output value will increase by 130% by the end of 1957 compared with 1952. The proportion of China's total industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value has been greatly increased in 1957. During the first Five-Year Plan period, China's self-sufficiency capacity in machinery and equipment has reached more than 60%, and its self-sufficiency capacity in metal materials has reached more than 80%. When all the major enterprises that started construction during the first five years are completed and put into production during the second five years, China's self-sufficiency capacity in machinery and equipment and metal materials will be further increased.
    Prioritizing the development of heavy industry is a basic policy of China's first Five-Year Plan. The development speed of heavy industry has greatly exceeded the development speed of the entire industry. In five years, the output value of China's means of production industry has increased by about two times, with an average annual increase of more than 24%. The average annual growth rate of the output of major heavy industrial products is: steel 31%, electricity 21%, coal 14%, oil 27%, machine manufacturing (calculated by total output value) 33%, cement 18%. China's steel output in 1957 is expected to reach 5.24 million tons, an increase of nearly 2.9 times compared with 1.35 million tons in 1952, and an increase of 4.7 times compared with the highest annual output of 920,000 tons in old China; China's total steel output in the first five years will reach 16.56 million tons, equivalent to 218% of the total steel output of 7.6 million tons in old China from 1900 to 1948 in 49 years. During the first Five-Year Plan period, China's light industry has also developed accordingly. The total output value of consumer goods industry has increased by about 80%, of which the output of cotton cloth has increased by 30%, the output of sugar has increased by 87%, and the output of machine-made paper has increased by 139%.
    While actively developing industry, China has strived to promote the development of agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy. The realization of agricultural cooperativization in China has changed the backwardness of individual agricultural decentralized management for thousands of years, greatly improved the production enthusiasm of the vast number of peasants, and provided conditions for the technical transformation of agriculture, thus opening up a broad road for the development of China's agriculture. In the process of cooperativization and after the basic realization of cooperativization, the production increase movement in China's rural areas has been carried out on a larger scale. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the state's appropriations for agriculture, water conservancy, and forestry reached more than 7.5 billion yuan, the net amount of agricultural loans was 2.9 billion yuan, and the supply of agricultural production materials also increased significantly. In terms of water conservancy, we have started to fundamentally control the Huai River, started to manage the Yellow River, and relied on the enthusiasm of the peasants to increase the irrigated area by more than 210 million mu in five years with the support of the state, which is equivalent to 60% of the irrigated area of 350 million mu developed in China for thousands of years up to 1952. The area of increased cultivated land reached more than 60 million mu. During the five years, although serious natural disasters were suffered in 1954 and 1956, and there were also considerable natural disasters in 1953 and 1957, the total agricultural output value and total grain output still increased year by year. In 1957, China's total grain output (excluding soybeans) is expected to reach 370 billion jin, an increase of more than 61 billion jin compared with 1952, and China's cotton output is expected to reach 32.8 million dan, an increase of more than 6.7 million dan compared with 1952. The output of other crops and the number of livestock have also increased. Due to the development of agriculture, although China's population has increased by more than 60 million in five years, China has still ensured self-sufficiency in grain and basically ensured self-sufficiency in raw materials for light industry.
    During the first Five-Year Plan period, China's transportation industry built 8,500 kilometers of new railways and more than 70,000 kilometers of new highways, the Ministry of Transportation added 410,000 tons of new ships, and built and added more than 110,000 pair-kilometers of long-distance telegraph and telephone lines, and improved the original various transportation equipment, basically meeting the needs of national economic development and people's lives.
    China's cultural and educational undertakings and scientific research undertakings have also made great progress and great achievements during the first Five-Year Plan period. In 1957, the number of students in colleges and universities reached 440,000, an increase of 250,000 compared with 1952; the number of students in secondary vocational schools reached more than 740,000, an increase of 360,000 compared with 1952; the number of students in ordinary middle schools and workers' and peasants' middle schools reached 5.95 million, an increase of 3.45 million compared with 1952; the number of students in primary schools reached more than 67 million, an increase of more than 16 million compared with 1952. During this period, the number of researchers in scientific research institutions affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences increased by about 4,000. The publication volume of newspapers and books, the transmission power of broadcasting, and the filming volume of films increased by more than 50% to more than 100%, respectively, and the achievements of other cultural undertakings and literary and artistic undertakings were also great. During the first Five-Year Plan period, 270,000 students graduated from Chinese colleges and universities and more than 840,000 students graduated from secondary vocational schools, which played a great role in solving the difficulty of China's lack of scientific and technical talents.
    After the large-scale economic construction and cultural construction of the first Five-Year Plan, China's working class has expanded its ranks and its technical strength has also grown. In 1957, the total number of industrial workers in China increased by about 8 million compared with 1952, of which the total number of technical personnel above the secondary level increased by more than 600,000. Most of the workers and technical personnel have generally improved their technical level by diligently studying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and undergoing practical training in large-scale construction. Now, most of the large and medium-sized enterprises, including iron and steel joint enterprises, non-ferrous metal enterprises, coal mines, power stations, oil refineries, machine manufacturing factories, and chemical factories, as well as railways, water conservancy, and other projects, can carry out their own design and construction, except for those with more complex geological conditions and high technical requirements. The party and state organs have also gained rich experience in leading socialist economic construction and cultural construction, which enables us to reduce mistakes and avoid detours in future construction.
    During the first Five-Year Plan period, while actively carrying out economic construction and cultural construction, China also actively improved people's lives. In the five years, Lai Ruoyu's report has detailed the work done by China in improving the lives of workers and staff, expanding employment, increasing wage levels, improving labor insurance and welfare, bonus systems, and enriching cultural life. What we have done in improving the lives of workers and staff is the maximum we can do under the current underdeveloped economy in China, which was fundamentally impossible in old China. In five years, the total income of Chinese peasants has increased by about 30%. The average per capita material consumption in the country has increased to varying degrees except for pork, which has not increased much.
    From the above situation, it can be seen that the development characteristics of the national economy during China's first Five-Year Plan are as follows: First, the socialist revolution and socialist construction are carried out simultaneously and promote each other. The decisive victory of the socialist revolution and the laying of the initial foundation for socialist industrialization have created more favorable conditions for the planned development of the national economy in the future. Second, whether it is production or construction, or whether it is economy or culture, it is developed at a high speed in a planned and proportional manner on the basis of the original very backward basis and with relatively full utilization and transformation of the original enterprises. Third, it is developed under the guidance of the policy of taking into account both construction and people's livelihood, and it is carried out in combination with strengthening political and ideological education and improving material life. Therefore, the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance has been continuously consolidated and developed, the socialist consciousness of the people of the country has been continuously improved, and the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers and peasants have been continuously improved. This is our guarantee of victory. These characteristics have fully demonstrated the superiority of the newly established socialist system, and fully demonstrated that the development of China's national economy is in line with the overall interests, long-term interests, and current interests of the working people of the country. This can understand why, under the leadership of the working class, the vast majority of the people of the country resolutely support the socialist revolution and socialist construction. When the bourgeois rightists frantically attacked the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the socialist system this summer, attempting to obliterate the achievements of socialist construction and conspiring to restore capitalism, the people rose up to defend socialism and thoroughly crushed the attack of the bourgeois rightists.
    In the process of implementing the first Five-Year Plan, due to our lack of experience in socialist construction and insufficient systematic research on China's economic situation, some shortcomings and errors occurred in our work, such as the improper handling of the interrelationships between certain sectors, certain aspects, and certain regions of the national economy, and there were also insufficient connections in the arrangement of planned targets between years. At the same time, the implementation of the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical and the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift in the construction industry were not enough. We must conduct specific analysis, summarize experience, and thoroughly correct these shortcomings and errors in the great rectification movement. However, the achievements of China's first Five-Year Plan are undoubtedly the main and basic ones, and the shortcomings and errors are only partial and temporary.
    The reason why China was able to achieve great achievements during the first Five-Year Plan period is that: domestically, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we relied on the working class, united the people of the country, and brought into play the positive factors; abroad, we received assistance from the fraternal countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and received the support of progressive people all over the world. This achievement proves that under the conditions of assistance from the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, we can completely rely on our own strength, that is, rely on the brave, hardworking, and revolutionary-traditioned working class, peasants, and other working people, rely on revolutionary intellectuals and other patriotic people, to build an economically and culturally backward country into an economically and culturally developed socialist country. What our predecessors could not do, we will definitely be able to do. What the imperialists think we cannot do, we will definitely be able to do. Once the Chinese people have seized political power and mastered their own destiny, they have opened a new era in China's history. The result of the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan has fully proved this truth. Moreover, it will not take us more than a hundred years like capitalist countries to build our country into an economically and culturally developed country, but only a few decades. China's socialist system makes it possible for us to develop social productive forces at a high speed. The result of the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan has also fully proved this truth. The Chinese people have reason to continue to advance towards socialism with full confidence and welcome the second Five-Year Plan that is about to begin.
    Now I will talk about the tasks and guidelines for future socialist construction.
    As mentioned earlier, we have established the socialist political system and economic system, and at the same time established the initial foundation for socialist industrialization. However, China has not yet been built into socialism and is still in the transition period. This is because: economically, the level of social productive forces in China is still relatively low, so China's socialist political system and economic system currently lack a relatively full material basis; politically and ideologically, although we have achieved extremely significant victories in the struggle against capitalism in 1957, the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism still requires a considerable period of time to finally resolve. We are faced with the serious task of further consolidating and developing socialism economically, politically, and ide ideologically, that is, the task of building China into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. To achieve this task, in addition to carrying the socialist revolution through to the end and achieving the complete victory of socialism over capitalism, the main thing in socialist construction is to build a basically complete industrial system in China, complete the National Agricultural Development Program, and complete the long-term plan for scientific development.
    It will take about twenty years to build China into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, counting from the founding of New China. It cannot be said that it is a very high speed to build socialism in about twenty years in a large country like ours with a large population and originally very backward economy and culture.
    When China has built a socialist power after three Five-Year Plans or a little more time, and further completed the fourth Five-Year Plan, China may catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in terms of the output of steel and other important industrial products. According to rough calculations, China's steel output may reach about 40 million tons by 1972, an increase of about 6.6 times compared with the output in 1957. The United Kingdom's steel output in 1956 has reached about 21 million tons, but based on the United Kingdom's slow industrial development speed, limited resources, and difficult to expand or even shrinking market, even if we put aside his inevitable economic depression and economic crisis, it is not easy for him to reach China's same level in steel output in 1972. In terms of the output of industrial products such as coal, machine tools, cement, and chemical fertilizers, China will definitely be able to surpass the United Kingdom's level in fifteen years. It is a great glorious and very arduous task for China's working class and all the people to change China's industry from a situation far behind the United Kingdom to a situation catching up with or surpassing the United Kingdom in fifteen years.
    Why is it possible for us to promote China's socialist construction at a high speed and build China into a socialist power in the next ten to fifteen years? Why can we catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in the output of steel and other important industrial products in the next fifteen years?
    Various international and domestic conditions have given us such full possibilities.
    First, the establishment of the socialist system in China politically and economically has paved the way for the full development of productive forces. In the past eight years, China's industrial and agricultural production has made great progress. Especially after this year's rectification movement and the struggle against the bourgeois rightists, the working class and peasants across the country are setting off a new upsurge in production, and all aspects of the work of state organs are being vigorously improved. The superiority of the socialist system guarantees the faster development of productive forces.
    Second, China has a large population, not only has extremely abundant labor resources, which can develop socialist construction faster and more quickly under the same technical conditions, but also makes China have the largest domestic market. The continuous increase and large increase in market needs provide the conditions for the rapid development of social productive forces, and at the same time make it possible for us to increase socialist accumulation in larger quantities. China's economy and culture are backward, and the people's living standards are still low. As Chairman Mao said, China is "poor" and "blank." Changing "poor" and "blank" is the goal of the Chinese working class uniting the people of the country and striving hard. Precisely because we are "poor" and "blank," the Chinese working class and the vast majority of the working people want revolution, want to take the socialist road, and have the ambition and drive in socialist construction, and can work hard and be brave, and can give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity.
    Third, China has abundant natural resources. According to the preliminary investigations that have been made, China's reserves of ferrous metals, some non-ferrous metals, and coal are very large. For example, China's preliminary grasp of the incomplete prospective reserves of minerals, iron ore is more than 12 billion tons, and coal is more than 1 trillion tons; China is also one of the countries with the most hydropower resources in the world, which makes it possible for us to accelerate the development of industry. China also has good natural conditions, which makes it possible for us to accelerate the development of agriculture.
    Fourth, China has the support of the powerful Soviet Union, which has been established for forty years, and the support of other socialist countries. At the same time, their valuable experience can be used for us to learn from, which makes it possible for us to accelerate the progress of construction.
    Fifth, we are in an era of rapid development of science and technology. With the help of the socialist fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union, we can directly adopt modern scientific and technological achievements in many aspects, shortening or even avoiding the process of groping.
    Sixth, the most fundamental condition is that China has the leadership of the well-trained Chinese Communist Party and the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, which can adopt correct lines, policies, and policies for the development of social productive forces. China's working class is brave, hardworking, and full of revolutionary traditions, China's peasants have embarked on the socialist road and are hardworking and thrifty, and China's intellectuals have undergone ideological transformation or are in the process of transformation. The working-class intellectuals are also growing, so the vast majority of the people of the country can resolutely implement the party's lines, policies, and policies.
    Of course, on the road forward, we will not fail to encounter difficulties. Due to China's large population, backward economy and culture, and poor foundation, the increase in financial and material resources will be limited to a certain extent in a certain period; we do not have enough experience in socialist construction, and it is difficult to avoid certain errors in our work. But as long as we mobilize all positive factors, use all favorable conditions, tap all potential forces, and adhere to the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, we will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and build China into a great socialist country in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. It is wrong to underestimate the possibility of China's high-speed development of social productive forces, underestimate the enthusiasm of the working class and the people of the country in production and construction, or not actively strive to turn this possibility into a reality.
    The party has always adopted a positive and promoting attitude towards China's socialist construction cause, especially the production and construction cause, and opposes a passive and conservative attitude. The Party Central Committee put forward the policy of carrying out socialist construction in a more, faster, better, and more economical way in the winter of 1955, and put forward the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift in 1956. These two policies are closely linked. Only by running enterprises, cooperatives, schools, and all other undertakings with the spirit of diligence and thrift can we make the socialist construction cause more, faster, better, and more economical. The first Five-Year Plan proves that we have great potential for increasing production and practicing economy. As long as we give full play to this potential, we can accumulate more funds for the country, and make the funds play a greater role, and we can build more and faster. It should be pointed out that when implementing the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, we must grasp the key points, and cannot do everything at once. If all undertakings want to be more and faster, and do things that can be done or not done, and spend money that can be spent or not spent, then we will not be able to make key undertakings more and faster, and we will not be able to achieve such a great task of socialist industrialization and agricultural modernization in the next ten to fifteen years. Therefore, whether it is industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce, or science, culture, education, and health, whether it is enterprises and institutions managed by the central government, or enterprises and institutions managed by local governments, they should adhere to the party's policy of building the country with diligence and thrift in their work, and grasp the key points, so that our socialist construction cause can truly be done more, faster, better, and more economically.
    China's second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy will begin soon. Since the various indicators of the second Five-Year Plan have not yet been finalized, I cannot report the detailed contents of this plan to the comrades now, but can only talk about some issues related to the tasks and policies based on the principles instructed by the Party Central Committee and the State Council.
    The basic tasks and construction policies of the second Five-Year Plan were stipulated in the suggestions on the second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy passed by the Eighth National Congress of the Party and in the report of Premier Zhou Enlai. These are still the main principles on which we rely to implement the second Five-Year Plan. Since the Eighth National Congress has experienced the practice of the two-year plan, we have gained a deeper understanding of the country's economic situation and the experience of construction work. Therefore, some adjustments must be made to the specific tasks and specific indicators of the second Five-Year Plan.
    The development of the national economy during China's second Five-Year Plan should implement the policy of developing industry and developing agriculture simultaneously on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry proposed by the Party Central Committee. This is the correct path to realize China's socialist industrialization. Our economic construction must be centered on heavy industry, so that heavy industry can be given priority in development, so as to lay a solid foundation for China's socialist industrialization during the second Five-Year Plan period; we must also pay full attention to the construction of agriculture at the same time, so that the entire agricultural production can be developed as quickly as possible, so as to adapt to the needs of people's lives and national construction to a greater extent.
    Industry is the leading force of the national economy, and heavy industry is the material foundation for socialist expanded reproduction. With the prioritized development of heavy industry, socialist expanded reproduction can be carried out smoothly. Although China's heavy industry has been greatly developed in the first five years, thus establishing the initial foundation for China's socialist industrialization, China's current production volume of heavy industry is not only much behind the Soviet Union and the United States, but also behind countries such as the United Kingdom, West Germany, and Japan, and is far from meeting the needs of China's socialist construction. China's agriculture and light industry, as well as the transportation industry, also cannot meet the needs of people's lives and national construction. The backwardness in light industry is due to the fact that agriculture and heavy industry cannot provide more raw materials. The further development of agriculture after cooperativization depends on heavy industry providing a relatively sufficient supply of chemical fertilizers, agricultural machinery, water conservancy machinery, transportation machinery, power, fuel, and building materials, and gradually carrying out technical transformation. The further development of the transportation industry depends more directly on heavy industry providing a large amount of equipment, materials, and fuel. It can be seen that the further development of China's agriculture, light industry, and transportation industry all need the development of heavy industry. Without a relatively developed heavy industry, there will be no modernization of industry, and there will be no modernization of agriculture and transportation industry, and there will be no modern science and technology and cultural development. During the second Five-Year Plan period, we must make heavy industry continue to develop at a high speed, with a total output increase of more than one time; and in order to promote the development of agriculture, we must make the parts that directly or indirectly serve agriculture develop faster. By 1962, we should strive for a steel output of about 12 million tons, a coal output of about 230 million tons, a power generation of about 44 billion degrees, a chemical fertilizer output of about 7 million tons, a cement output of about 12.5 million tons, and the output of agricultural machinery will be greatly increased according to actual needs. The output of these products has reached or exceeded the indicators proposed in the "Eighth National Congress" on the second Five-Year Plan. As for the output of crude oil and machine tools, the former will be lower than the indicators proposed in the "Eighth National Congress" due to the current limitations of resource conditions, and the latter will be lower due to the need to reduce the limitations, but if conditions change, production will be increased as much as possible.
    The experience of implementing the first Five-Year Plan shows that while prioritizing the development of heavy industry, China must pay full attention to the development of agriculture and light industry. Chairman Mao Zedong instructed us: "The development of industry must go hand in hand with the development of agriculture. Only then will industry have raw materials and markets, and will it be possible to accumulate more funds for the establishment of a strong heavy industry." During China's first Five-Year Plan period, the party, the government, and the vast number of peasants used great efforts to promote the development of agriculture. In addition to basically realizing agricultural cooperativization nationwide, the state also increased investment and loans in agriculture, carried out large-scale water conservancy construction, and increased the supply of agricultural machinery, water conservancy machinery, chemical fertilizers, and power. At the same time, in accumulating fertilizers, building small-scale farmland water conservancy, improving the farming system, popularizing advanced technical experience, intensive farming, popularizing good seeds, increasing high-yield crops, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, the vast number of peasants carried out extremely massive work with the support of the state, and achieved significant results, thus enabling the total agricultural output value and the output of crops such as grain and cotton to reach the planned targets, and slightly exceed them, avoiding the danger of agriculture being out of step with industry. However, China's serious natural disasters, insufficient cultivated land, and backward agricultural technology have limited the faster development of agriculture. Compared with the rapidly developing industry, compared with the needs of people's lives and national construction, agriculture still appears to be lagging behind. The supply of certain consumer goods necessary for people's lives has been somewhat strained in recent years, and the fundamental reason is that agricultural development is relatively slow.
    Agriculture occupies a particularly important position in China's national economy. As everyone knows, China is a large agricultural country. Agriculture accounts for a large proportion of social production. In 1957, that is, after the large-scale economic construction of the first Five-Year Plan, and the rapid development of industry, agriculture still accounts for nearly half of the total industrial and agricultural output value, and nearly two-thirds of the net industrial and agricultural output value (total output value minus material consumption). At the same time, China has a large population, and the demand for consumer goods is very large, and the rural population accounts for more than 80% of the national population. Agriculture is not only the main source of food and clothing for the people, but also an important market for industrial products. The speed of agricultural development, and the bumper or poor harvest of agriculture, greatly affect the speed of development of the entire national economy, affect the degree of improvement in people's lives, and affect the accumulation of the state and cooperatives. To change the current situation of China's backward agricultural country, we must not only actively develop industry, but also actively develop agriculture. During the second Five-Year Plan period, we must, on the basis of further consolidating agricultural cooperatives, actively adopt various effective technical measures in accordance with the requirements of the 1956 to 1967 National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), with the focus on increasing the yield per unit area of agriculture, supplemented by land reclamation under possible conditions, to increase the output of agricultural products more. By the last year of the second Five-Year Plan, that is, in 1962, we must strive for the national grain output to be no less than 480 billion jin, that is, an increase of more than 110 billion jin compared with 1957; the cotton output to be no less than 43 million dan, that is, an increase of more than 10 million dan compared with 1957; and the number of pigs to be no less than 220 million, that is, an increase of about 100 million compared with 1957.
    In order to promote the development of agriculture, the second Five-Year Plan will take the following major measures: (1) Increase the state's investment in agriculture, water conservancy, and forestry. At the same time, agricultural cooperatives should use most of the increased accumulation to develop agricultural production. (2) Plan to control the seriously harmful rivers, widely develop small-scale farmland water conservancy, reduce waterlogging disasters, and increase the irrigated area.

    关于我国第一个五年计划的成就和今后社会主义建设的任务、方针的报告
    ——1957年12月7日在中国工会第八次全国代表大会上
　　李富春各位代表、各位来宾：
    我现在向同志们报告我国第一个五年计划的成就和今后社会主义建设的任务和方针，并且代表国务院热烈祝贺大会的成功。
    依靠全国工人阶级和全体人民的努力，我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划已经完成和超额完成了。事实上，我国第一个五年计划的某些重要任务和某些重要指标，如社会主义改造任务，工业总产值，粮食总产量，铁路和公路的运输量等等，在1956年，就已经提前一年完成和超额完成。我国的国民经济在1956年大发展的基础上，在1957年又有了新的发展，这样就保证了第一个五年计划的胜利实现。根据初步预计，到1957年底，工业总产值（不包括手工业产值，下同）将超过五年计划17％左右；农副业总产值和粮食、棉花的总产量都将达到五年计划的指标，并且略有超过；各种现代运输工具的货运量将超过五年计划14％以上，其中铁路货运量将超过11％以上；基本建设投资总额即基本建设工程总量，将超过五年计划13％以上，其中工业基本建设将超过7％左右，农业、水利、林业基本建设将超过53.7％，交通运输基本建设将超过12％；各级学校在校学生总数也都超额完成了五年计划。
    由于绝大多数指标的完成和超额完成，我国的社会主义工业化的初步基础已经建立起来，我国的农业、手工业和资本主义工商业已经基本上改造成为社会主义的经济。
    在第一个五年计划期间我们所取得的伟大成就，首先是社会主义革命的决定性的胜利。在1956年，经过了农业合作化、手工业合作化和资本主义工商业实行公私合营的高潮，我们就基本上完成了在生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命。在1956年底，我国的工业总产值中，国营经济占65.5％，合作社经济占2％，公私合营经济占32.5％。在农业总产值中，国营经济约占1％多一点，合作社经济将近占94％，个体经济约占5％。在商业机构零售总额中，国营经济占38.5％，供销合作社经济占29.9％，公私合营经济和合作经济（组织起来合作经营的小商贩）占28.6％，私营经济占3％。这一切都证明了我国的社会主义经济成份不论在城市或者在农村都确立了巩固的统治地位，而资本主义经济已经基本上被消灭，个体经济已经退居无足轻重的地位，这就是说，社会主义经济制度已经在我国确立起来。
    接着1956年在生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命的胜利，我们在1957年又通过全民整风和反右派斗争这个伟大的运动，开展了政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，并且也取得了决定性的胜利。这样，我国的社会主义制度就更加巩固了，任何敌人也不可能阻止中国工人阶级团结全国人民沿着社会主义道路前进了。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我国在社会主义建设方面的成就也是十分巨大的，我们已经实现了第一个五年计划提出的奋斗目标，建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础。第一个五年计划期间经济和文教部门的基本建设投资总额预计为四百八十四亿九千万元，其中工业部门的基本建设投资预计为二百七十三亿八千万元，开始施工的限额以上的建设单位有八百二十多个，预计在今年底可以全部建成的约有四百五十个，其中属于苏联帮助设计的一百五十六项的有五十七个（此外还有部分建成投入生产的十个）；限额以下的建设单位计划为二千三百多个，在计划执行中有了很多增加，并且绝大部分都可以在今年年底建成。由于上述建设的完成，1957年我国工业固定资产总额将比1952年增长一倍以上。工业基本建设的大规模进行，不仅大大地增加了工业生产能力，而且建立了一系列的新工业部门，改变了我国过去在殖民地和半殖民地时期所造成的工业基础薄弱和残缺不全、互不配合的状态，使我国变成为一个具有飞机制造业、汽车制造业、高效率蒸汽机车制造业、新式机床制造业、发电设备制造业、冶金和矿山设备制造业及高级合金钢、重要有色金属冶炼业的国家。我国以鞍钢为中心的东北工业基地已经基本上建成，上海和其他沿海城市的工业基础也都已经大为加强，同时，在华北地区、华中地区和西北地区，新的工业区正在形成，在西南地区和华南地区，也开始了部分的工业建设。第一个五年在进行大规模新工业建设的同时，我国原有工业企业的生产能力也有了很大发挥，因而使我国工业总产值到1957年底将比1952年增长130％。1957年我国工业总产值在工业农业总产值中的比重已经有很大的提高。第一个五年计划期间，我国机器设备的自给能力已经达到60％以上，金属材料的自给能力已经达到80％以上，而当第一个五年内开工建设的重大企业在第二个五年内全部建设完工并且发挥生产能力的时候，我国的机器设备和金属材料的自给能力将会有更多的提高。
    优先发展重工业是我国第一个五年计划的一项基本方针，重工业的发展速度大大地超过了整个工业的发展速度，在五年内，我国的生产资料工业产值增长了两倍左右，平均每年增长24％以上。主要重工业产品的产量平均每年的增长速度为：钢31％，电力21％，煤14％，石油27％，机器制造（以全部产值计）33％，水泥18％。我国的钢产量在1957年预计将达到五百二十四万吨，比1952年的一百三十五万吨增长了将近二点九倍，比旧中国历史上的最高年产量九十二万吨增长了四点七倍；我国第一个五年合计的钢产量将达到一千六百五十六万吨，等于旧中国从1900年到1948年共四十九年间钢的总产量七百六十万吨的218％。在第一个五年计划期间，我国的轻工业也有了相应的发展，消费资料工业的总产值增长了80％左右，其中棉布产量增长了30％，食糖产量增长了87％，机制纸产量增长了139％。
    我国在积极发展工业的同时，努力推进了农业、林业和水利事业的发展。我国农业合作化的实现，改变了几千年来个体农业分散经营的落后面貌，大大提高了广大农民的生产积极性，并且为农业的技术改造提供了条件，从而为我国农业的发展开辟了广阔的道路。在合作化的过程中和基本上实现了合作化之后，我国农村中的增产运动也就更大规模地开展起来。第一个五年计划期间，国家对于农业、水利和林业方面的拨款达到七十五亿元以上，农业贷款净额有二十九亿元，农业生产资料的供应也有了很大的增长。在水利方面，我们已经着手根治淮河，开始治理黄河，并且依靠农民的积极性，在国家支援下，五年内增加灌溉面积二亿一千多万亩，等于我国到1952年止几千年开发的灌溉面积三亿五千万亩的60％。增加的耕地面积达六千多万亩。在五年中间，虽然在1954年和1956年遭受了严重的自然灾害，在1953年和1957年也有不小的自然灾害，但是农业总产值和粮食总产量还是逐年有所增加的。在1957年，我国的粮食总产量（不包括大豆）预计达到三千七百亿斤，比1952年增加了六百一十多亿斤，我国的棉花产量预计达到三千二百八十万担，比1952年增加了六百七十多万担，其他各种作物的产量和牲畜的数量都有了增加。由于农业的发展，五年内虽然我国的人口增加了六千多万人，但是我国仍然保证了粮食的自给，并且基本上保证了轻工业原料的自给。
    我国的交通运输业，在第一个五年计划期间新建了八千五百公里的铁路和七万多公里的公路，交通部新增加船舶四十一万载重吨，新建和加挂长途电报、电话线路十一万多对公里，并且改善了原有的各种交通运输的设备，基本上满足了国民经济发展和人民生活的需要。
    我国的文化教育事业和科学研究事业在第一个五年计划期间也有了很大的发展，并且取得了巨大的成就。1957年，高等学校在校学生数达到四十四万人，比1952年增加了二十五万人；中等专业学校在校学生数达到七十四万多人，比1952年增加了三十六万人；普通中学和工农中学在校学生数达到五百九十五万人，比1952年增加了三百四十五万人；小学在校学生数达到六千七百多万人，比1952年增加了一千六百多万人。在这期间，中国科学院所属科学研究机构的研究人员约增加了四千多人。报刊和图书的出版量，广播的发射电力，影片的摄制量，分别增长了50％以上到一倍以上，其他文化事业和文学艺术事业的成绩也是很大的。第一个五年计划期间我国高等学校毕业的学生达到二十七万人，中等专业学校毕业的学生达到八十四万多人，对于解决我国科学技术人材缺乏的困难，起了很大的作用。
    经过第一个五年计划大规模的经济建设和文教建设，我国的工人阶级的队伍扩大了，技术力量也壮大起来了，1957年我国产业职工的总数比1952年约增加了八百万人，其中中等以上的技术人员总数增加了六十多万人。大部分的工人和技术人员，由于努力学习了苏联先进经验，经过大规模建设的实际锻炼，普遍地提高了技术水平。现在，一般的大中型企业，包括钢铁联合企业、有色金属企业、煤矿、电站、炼油厂、机器制造工厂和化学工厂等，以及铁路、水利等工程，除地质条件比较复杂和技术条件要求很高的以外，都可以自己进行设计和进行建设了。党和国家机关在领导社会主义的经济建设和文教建设方面，也取得了丰富的经验，使我们有可能在今后的建设中减少错误和少走弯路。
    我国在第一个五年计划期间，在积极进行经济建设和文化建设的同时，也积极改善了人民的生活。五年内我国在改善职工生活中，在扩大就业面、提高工资水平、改善劳动保险和福利、奖金制度、丰富文化生活等方面所做的工作，赖若愚同志的报告中已详细讲了。在改善职工生活方面，我们已经做了的，是在我国目前经济还不发达的条件下所能做到的最大限度，这在旧中国是根本无法做到的。五年内，我国农民的总收入大约提高了30％。全国每人平均的物质消费量，除猪肉一项没有什么增加以外，其他各种消费品都有不同程度的增长。
    从上述情况可以看出，我国第一个五年计划期间的国民经济的发展，具有以下几个特点：第一，社会主义革命和社会主义建设是同时进行和互相推进的，社会主义革命的决定性的胜利，和社会主义工业化初步基础的奠定，为今后国民经济的有计划的发展创造了更为有利的条件。第二，不论生产或者建设，也不论经济或者文化，都是在原来非常落后的基础上，在比较充分地利用、改造原有企业的条件下，有计划按比例地高速度发展的。第三，是在兼顾建设和生活的方针指导下发展的，是在加强政治思想教育和改善物质生活相结合下进行的，因此以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政得到不断的巩固和发展，全国人民的社会主义觉悟不断提高，广大工农劳动群众的积极性和创造性不断提高，这是我们胜利的保证。这些特点，已经充分表现了建立不久的社会主义制度的优越性，并且充分地表现了我国国民经济的发展是符合全国劳动人民的整体利益、长远利益和当前利益的。这就能够了解，为什么在工人阶级的领导下，全国人民的绝大多数都坚决拥护社会主义革命和社会主义建设，当今年夏季资产阶级右派分子猖狂进攻中国共产党的领导和社会主义制度、企图抹杀社会主义建设的成就而阴谋复辟资本主义的时候，人民就起来保卫社会主义，彻底粉碎了资产阶级右派分子的进攻。
    在执行第一个五年计划的过程中，由于我们缺乏社会主义建设的经验，对中国的经济情况系统研究不够，因此在工作中也就发生了一些缺点和错误，例如对国民经济的某些部门、某些方面、某些地区之间的相互关系处理得不尽适当，在计划指标的年度之间的安排上也有不够衔接的地方，同时在建设事业方面贯彻执行又多又快又好又省的方针和勤俭建国的方针都还不够。这些缺点和错误，我们要在伟大的整风运动中，进行具体分析，总结经验，并且彻底改正。但是，我国第一个五年计划的成就无疑是主要的、基本的，缺点和错误只是部分的和暂时的。
    我国在第一个五年计划期间所以能够取得伟大的成就，是由于：在国内，在中国共产党的正确领导下，我们依靠了工人阶级，团结了全国人民，发挥了积极因素；在国外，我们得到了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各兄弟国家的援助，并且得到了全世界进步人士的支持。这种成就证明了在以苏联为首的社会主义各国的援助的条件下，我们完全能够依靠自己的力量，即依靠勇敢、勤劳并且富有革命传统的工人阶级、农民和其他劳动人民，依靠革命知识分子以及其他爱国人士，把一个经济文化落后的国家建设成为一个经济文化发达的社会主义国家。我们的前人所做不到的事情，我们一定能够做到。帝国主义分子认为我们做不到的事情，我们也一定能够做到。我国人民一旦掌握了政权，掌握了自己的命运，就开辟了我国历史的新纪元，第一个五年计划执行的结果已经充分证明了这个真理。而且，我们把我国建设成为一个经济文化发达的国家，决不会像资本主义国家那样需要百年以上的时间，而只要几十年的时间就行了，我国的社会主义制度使我们有可能高速度地发展社会生产力，第一个五年计划执行的结果也已经充分证明了这个真理。中国人民有理由满怀信心地继续向社会主义前进，迎接即将开始的第二个五年计划。
    现在我再说一说今后社会主义建设的任务和方针。
    如前所说，我们已经确立了社会主义的政治制度和经济制度，同时建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础，但是，我国还没有建成社会主义，还处在过渡时期。这是因为：在经济上，我国社会生产力的水平还比较低，因而我国社会主义的政治制度和经济制度，在目前还缺乏比较充分的物质基础；在政治上和思想上，我们虽然在1957年同资本主义的斗争中取得了极其重大的胜利，可是社会主义同资本主义之间的两条道路的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时期才能最后解决。我们面临着从经济上和从政治上、思想上进一步巩固和发展社会主义的严重任务，即把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国的任务。实现这个任务，除了必须把社会主义革命进行到底，取得社会主义对资本主义的彻底胜利以外，在社会主义建设方面，主要的就是要在我国建成一个基本上完整的工业体系，完成全国农业发展纲要，完成科学发展的远景规划。
    把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，从新中国成立的时候算起，大约需要二十年左右的时间。像我们这样一个人口众多和原来经济文化又十分落后的大国，用二十年左右的时间建成社会主义，不能不说是很高的速度。
    当我国经过三个五年计划或者更多一点的时间建成一个社会主义强国，并且进一步完成第四个五年计划的时候，我国就有可能在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国。根据大体计算，我国到1972年，钢的产量有可能达到四千万吨左右，即比1957年的产量增长六点六倍左右。英国在1956年钢的产量已经达到二千一百万吨左右，但是根据英国工业发展速度慢，资源有限和市场难以扩大甚至日益缩小的情况，既使抛开他必然要发生的经济萧条和经济危机不说，他在1972年钢的产量也不易达到我国同年的水平。而在煤炭、机床、水泥、化学肥料等工业品的产量方面，十五年后我国肯定能够超过英国的水平。在十五年后把我国的工业从现在远远落后于英国的状况改变为赶上或者超过英国的状况，这是我国工人阶级和全体人民一个伟大的光荣的而且是十分艰巨的任务。
    为什么我们有可能高速度地推进我国社会主义建设，在今后十年到十五年的时间内把我国建设成一个社会主义强国呢？为什么我们又能够在今后十五年后在钢铁和其他重要工业产品产量方面赶上或者超过英国呢？
    国际和国内的各种条件，给了我们这样充分的可能性。
    第一，我国在政治上和经济上社会主义制度的确立，为生产力的充分发展铺平了道路。八年来，我国工农业生产有了巨大的发展，特别是经过今年的整风运动和反击资产阶级右派分子的斗争，全国工人阶级和农民正在掀起一个新的生产高潮，国家机关的各方面的工作正在大力的改进。社会主义制度的优越性，保证了生产力的更快发展。
    第二，我国拥有大量的人口，不仅有极丰富的劳动力资源，能够在相同的技术条件下更多更快地发展社会主义建设事业，而且使我国具有最广大的国内市场，市场需要的不断增加和大量增加就提供了迅速发展社会生产力的条件，同时也使我们有可能较大量地增加社会主义的积累。我国经济文化落后，人民生活水平还低，正如毛主席所说的我国是一“穷”二“白”。改变“穷”和“白”，这是我国工人阶级团结全国人民努力奋斗的目标。正因为我们“穷”和“白”，所以我国工人阶级和全国绝大多数的劳动人民要革命，要走社会主义的道路，并且在社会主义建设中有志气、有劲头，能够勤劳勇敢，能够发挥积极性和创造性。
    第三，我国拥有丰富的自然资源，根据现在已经初步查明的情况，我国的黑色金属、某些有色金属和煤炭等矿物的储藏量都是很多的，例如，我国初步掌握的还不完全的矿产的远景储量，铁矿石有一百二十亿吨以上，煤有一万亿吨以上；我国又是世界上几个水力资源最多的国家之一，这就使我们有可能加速工业的发展。我国也有良好的自然条件，使我们有可能加速农业的发展。
    第四，我国有建国已经四十年的强大的苏联的支援，还有其他各个社会主义国家的支援，同时，他们的宝贵经验可供我们学习，使我们有可能加速建设的进度。
    第五，我们处在科学技术迅速发展的时代，在以苏联为首的社会主义各兄弟国家的帮助下，我们在许多方面可以直接采用现代的科学技术成就，缩短以至避开摸索的过程。
    第六，最根本的条件，还在于我国有久经锻炼的中国共产党的领导，有毛泽东主席的领导，能够对发展社会生产力采取正确的路线、方针和政策。我国的工人阶级勇敢、勤劳和富于革命传统，我国的农民已经走上社会主义的道路，并且勤劳俭朴，我国的知识分子已经经过了思想改造，或者正在改造过程中，工人阶级的知识分子也正在成长，因而全国人民的绝大多数都能够坚决执行党的路线、方针和政策。
    当然，在前进的道路上，我们是不会不遇到困难的，由于我国人口多，经济文化落后，底子穷，在一个时期内财力、物力的增长，都会受到一定的限制；我们社会主义建设的经验不够，工作中发生某些错误也是难于避免的。但是只要我们动员一切积极的因素，利用一切有利的条件，发掘一切潜在的力量，坚持勤俭建国的方针，我们就一定能够战胜一切困难，又多又快又好又省地把我国建成一个伟大的社会主义国家。那种对于我国高速度发展社会生产力的可能性估计不足，对于工人阶级和全国人民的生产建设积极性估计不足，或者不积极努力把这种可能性变为现实性，都是错误的。
    党对我国的社会主义建设事业，特别是生产建设事业，始终是采取积极的促进的态度，反对消极的保守的态度。党中央在1955年冬季就提出了又多又快又好又省地进行社会主义建设的方针，1956年又提出了勤俭建国的方针。这两个方针是密切联系的，只有用勤俭的精神来办企业、办合作社、办学校、办其他一切事业，我们才能够把社会主义建设事业作得又多又快又好又省。第一个五年计划证明，我们增产节约的潜力是很大的，只要我们把这种潜力充分发挥出来，就可以为国家积累更多的资金，并且使资金发挥更大的作用，也就可以建设得多一些和快一些。应当指出，在执行又多又快又好又省的方针的时候，必须抓住重点，不能百废俱兴，齐头并进。如果各种事业都要又多又快，把那些可办可不办的事情也办起来，把那些可花可不花的钱也花掉，那我们就不能够使重点事业办得又多又快，我们也就不能够在今后十年到十五年的时间内实现社会主义工业化和农业近代化这样一个伟大的任务。因此，无论是工业、农业、交通运输业、商业各部门，或者是科学、文化、教育、卫生各部门，无论是中央管理的企业单位和事业单位，或者是地方管理的企业单位和事业单位，在工作中都应当坚持党的勤俭建国的方针，并且抓住重点，真正使我们的社会主义建设事业作得又多又快又好又省。
    我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划，不久就要开始了。由于第二个五年计划的各项指标还没有最后确定，因此我现在不能向同志们报告这个计划的详细内容，而只能根据党中央和国务院指示的原则，说一说有关任务和方针的一些问题。
    关于第二个五年计划的基本任务和建设方针，在党的“八大”通过的关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议中和周恩来总理的报告中都作了规定，这些，仍然是我们实行第二个五年计划所主要依靠的原则。由于“八大”到现在经过了两个年度计划的实践，我们对于国家的经济情况和建设工作的经验，在认识上又深入了一步，因此，对第二个五年计划的具体任务和具体指标的安排，必须做一些调整。
      我国第二个五年计划期间国民经济的发展，应当贯彻执行党中央提出的在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，这是实现我国社会主义工业化的正确道路。我们的经济建设必须以重工业为中心，使重工业得到优先的发展，以便在第二个五年计划期间建立起我国社会主义工业化的巩固基础；也必须同时充分注意农业的建设，使整个农业生产得到尽可能快的发展，以便在更大程度上适应人民生活和国家建设的需要。
      工业是国民经济的领导力量，而重工业是社会主义扩大再生产的物质基础。有了重工业的优先发展，社会主义扩大再生产才能顺利进行。我
  国的重工业虽然在第一个五年内得到了较大的发展，从而为我国的社会主义工业化建立了初步的基础，但是我国重工业目前的生产量，不仅比苏联和美国落后得多，也比英国、西德和日本等国家落后，远不能满足我国社会主义建设的需要。我国的农业和轻工业，以及交通运输业，同样地不能满足人民生活和国家建设的需要。轻工业的落后是由于农业和重工业不能提供更多的原料。而农业在合作化以后的进一步发展，有待于由重工业提供比较充足的化学肥料、农业机械、水利机械、运输机械、动力、燃料和建筑材料，逐步地进行技术改造。交通运输业的进一步发展，更直接有赖于重工业提供大量的设备、材料和燃料。可见，我国农业、轻工业和交通运输业的进一步发展，都需要重工业的发展。没有比较发达的重工业，就没有工业的现代化，也就没有农业和交通运输业的现代化，同样不能有现代的科学技术和文化的发展。在第二个五年计划期内，我们必须使重工业继续高速度地发展，总产量增长一倍以上；并且为着促进农业的发展，必须使那些直接或者间接为农业服务的部分发展得快一些。到1962年，我们应当争取钢产量达到一千二百万吨左右，煤产量达到二亿三千万吨左右，发电量达到四百四十亿度左右，化学肥料产量达到七百万吨左右，水泥产量达到一千二百五十万吨左右，农业机械的产量将根据实际需要有大量的增加。这些产品的产量都达到了或者超过了党的
  “八大”关于第二个五年计划的建议提出的指标。至于原油和机床的产量，前者由于目前资源条件的限制，后者由于需要减少的限制，将比“八大”建议提出的指标降低一些，但是如果条件变化，将尽可能提高生产。
      第一个五年计划执行的经验说明，我国在优先发展重工业的同时，必须充分注意农业和轻工业的发展。毛泽东主席指示我们：“发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举，工业才有原料和市场，才有可能为建立强大的重工业积累较多的资金。”我国在第一个五年计划期间，党和政府以及广大农民用了很大的力量推进了农业的发展，除了在全国范围内基本上实现了农业合作化以外，国家还增加了对农业的投资和贷款，进行了大规模的水利建设，增加了农业机械、水利机械、化学肥料和动力的供应，同时，在积聚肥料、兴修小型农田水利、改良耕作制度、推广先进技术经验、精耕细作、推广良种、增加高产作物和防治病虫害等方面，广大农民在国家的支援下，进行了极其浩繁的工作，收到了显著的效果，因而使农业总产值和粮食、棉花等作物产量达到了计划指标，并且略有超过，避免了农业同工业脱节的危险。但是，由于我国的自然灾害严重，耕地不足，农业技术还落后，限制了农业的更快发展。同迅速发展的工业相比较，同人民生活和国家建设的需要相比较，农业还显得落后了一步。近年以来人民必需的某些生活消费品的供应情况有些紧张，根本的原因就在于农业发展还比较慢。
    农业在我国的国民经济中处于特殊重要的地位。大家知道，我国是一个大农业国，农业在社会生产中占有很大的比重，在1957年，即是说经过了第一个五年计划的大规模经济建设，工业已经得到迅速发展的情况下，农业在工业农业总产值中还占将近一半，在工业农业净产值（总产值扣除物质消耗）中还占将近三分之二。同时，我国人口很多，生活消费品的需要量很大，而农村人口又占了全国人口的百分之八十以上。农业不仅是人民衣食的主要来源，而且是工业品的重要市场。农业发展的快慢，农业的丰收或者欠收，就在很大程度上影响着整个国民经济发展的快慢，影响着人民生活改善的程度，影响到国家和合作社的积累。我们要改变我国落后的农业国的现状，不仅要积极发展工业，而且要积极发展农业。在第二个五年计划期内，我们必须在进一步巩固农业合作社的基础上，根据1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的要求，积极地采取各种有效的技术措施，以提高农业的单位面积产量为主，辅之以可能条件下的开荒，更多地增加农产品的产量。到第二个五年计划的最后一年，即1962年，我们必须争取全国的粮食产量不低于四千八百亿斤，即比1957年增加一千一百亿斤以上；棉花产量不低于四千三百万担，即比1957年增加一千万担以上；猪的头数不低于二亿二千万头，即比1957年增加一亿头左右。
      为了促进农业的发展，第二个五年计划将采取如下一些重大措施：（1）增加国家对农业、水利、林业的投资。同时，农业合作社应当把增加的积累的大部分用之于发展农业生产。（2）有计划地整治为害严重的河流，广泛开展小型的农田水利，减少水涝灾害，增加灌溉面积。（3）努力增加化学肥料的供应，同时广泛开展农村中的积肥造肥运动，以提高农田的施肥量。（4）增加适合于我国各地农业发展需要的各种机械的供应，努力推广各种先进的技术经验。（5）尽可能增加复种面积。（6）努力改良品种和防治病虫害。（7）发展山区交通，大力开发山区，并且努力保持水土。（8）在可能条件下积极开垦荒地。
    我们认为：发展工业和发展农业同时并举，应当包括工业和农业互相配合和互相促进的内容在内。根据第一个五年计划的执行情况，根据发展工业和发展农业互相配合、互相促进的要求，第二个五年计划应当适当调整重工业内部各部分之间的发展关系。
    加速农业的发展，不仅是农业部门和全国农民的任务，而且是工业、运输业、商业、科学研究、文化教育、卫生各部门和全国职工的任务，可以说是全国人民的共同任务。因为有了农业的大发展，就有工业的大发展，也就有国民经济的大发展。各部门的职工同志们，应当为农业发展提供各种有利的条件。我们必须支援农业，支援农民，保证在今后十年内达到全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）提出的要求。
    在今后的社会主义建设工作中，我们还必须贯彻执行从六亿人口出发统筹兼顾、适当安排的方针。我们面临着更大规模的建设任务，但是由于我国人口多，经济文化还落后，因此就常常遇到资金问题，物资问题，技术干部问题，就业问题，就学问题等等。这些问题的解决，必须根据毛泽东主席指示的从六亿人口出发，统筹兼顾，适当安排。在国民经济计划中，尤其应当注意做到全面照顾，全面安排。除了解决重工业、轻工业和农业之间的发展关系问题以外，还必须相应地注意国民经济其他各个部门之间的关系问题，经济建设和文教建设之间的关系问题，国家建设和人民生活之间的关系问题，这一部分人民的生活和那一部分人民的生活之间的关系问题，中央和地方之间的关系问题，各种经济成份之间的关系问题等等。拿国民收入的分配来说，我们应当既照顾人民生活改善的需要，又要满足国家建设发展的需要；既照顾各项建设事业发展的需要，又适当满足国家重点建设优先发展的需要；既照顾地方重点建设的需要，又适当满足中央建设事业发展的需要；在生活方面，对工人、农民和知识分子应当统一安排，既要反对平均主义，又要防止过分悬殊。总之，对于生产、建设、劳动和民生等各项问题的安排，都要求从整体观点和全局观点出发，去掉本位主义观点和局部观点。在这里，问题的中心在于相信和依靠群众的力量，充分发挥我国的人力物力和财力的作用，实现社会主义扩大再生产，一方面保证六亿人民有吃有穿，逐步地做到吃得更好、穿得更好，一方面加速我国的社会主义建设。而加速社会主义建设，也正是为了不断地满足人民物质生活和文化生活的需要。
    同志们，我们已经取得了第一个五年计划的胜利，在这个胜利的基础上，在全民整风和反右派斗争胜利的基础上，一个规模更加壮阔的社会主义建设的新的高潮正在形成。在这个高潮中间，我国工人阶级在全国人民中要发挥模范作用、带头作用和骨干作用，团结全国人民取得彻底的社会主义革命的胜利和更大的社会主义建设的胜利。希望各级工会组织进一步联系职工群众，更好地发挥组织群众和教育群众的作用，发扬广大职工群众的积极性和创造性，开展社会主义劳动竞赛，使社会主义建设的高潮迅速到来和持久地向前发展。我们相信，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的英明的领导下，我国工人阶级一定能够团结全国人民担当起新的艰巨的社会主义建设任务，也一定能够胜利地把我国建成一个伟大的富强的社会主义国家。
    祝中国工会第八次全国代表大会成为动员全国职工掀起生产高潮的大会，成为团结全国人民取得社会主义建设更大胜利的大会。
