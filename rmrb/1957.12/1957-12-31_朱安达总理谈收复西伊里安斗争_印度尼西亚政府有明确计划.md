Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 29th: Antara News Agency reported that Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda revealed on the afternoon of the 28th that he was very sorry about the article written by former Vice President Hatta, published in some Jakarta newspapers on the 28th, regarding the struggle for West Irian and its relationship to the people's living standards. Djuanda also refuted the remarks made by some people, encouraged by Hatta, which stated that the government seemed to have no clear plan in the West Irian struggle.

Djuanda said this when answering questions from reporters. The reporter asked what the government's reaction was to Hatta's article. Hatta's article mainly stated that the government had no clear plan in carrying out the West Irian struggle and disagreed with what the government had done before.

When refuting Hatta's criticism, Prime Minister Djuanda cited the fact that some institutions had already been established, such as those concerning the abolition of the Round Table Conference Agreement, the restriction of Dutch companies' profit transfers, the drafting of foreign investment laws, and the recent National Construction Conference also passed a resolution on the West Irian issue. The National Construction Conference was personally presided over by Hatta.

Prime Minister Djuanda further said that the measures taken by the government were only to realize the above matters. He also said that the measures had been accelerated.

Djuanda said, "I disagree with Hatta's statement, because the National Committee on Abolishing the Round Table Conference Agreement has existed for a long time. What we are pursuing now is just to realize the abolition of the Round Table Conference Agreement." Djuanda said that all the plans had been prepared long ago.

The Prime Minister talked about the resolution of the National Construction Conference. A resolution on economic issues clearly stated that Dutch companies, including shipping companies, should be taken over or confiscated and supervised or managed, and that the transfer of intangible income should be cancelled. The Prime Minister said that at present, we have not ruled out the possibility of normalizing relations with the Netherlands. Therefore, we have not confiscated all Dutch enterprises. Djuanda also reminded that at the National Construction Conference, it had been decided to sever trade relations with the Netherlands and restrict the actions and interests of the Dutch in Indonesia.

Prime Minister Djuanda said, "It would be too naive to give the Dutch six months' advance warning of the measures to be taken. If we followed Hatta's advice, we might not take any action in thirty years."

The Prime Minister confirmed that the workers took action before the government took action, but he said that the workers took these actions because there were signs that Dutch business owners would make the situation serious.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 30th: Many newspapers in Jakarta today published editorials commenting on the article by former Indonesian Vice President Hatta and the remarks made by Prime Minister Djuanda regarding Hatta's article.

"Masyarakat" wrote that the struggle to recover West Irian is not a matter related to only one group or one social class. In this struggle, all forces should be united, and all opposition should be avoided.

"Masyarakat" said, "Djuanda's remarks are very clear to those who are willing to understand the truth of the matter," and "Our responsibility is to assist in the measures and steps taken by the government."

"Indonesia Raya" expressed disagreement with Hatta's statement in his article that the people should not have to endure sacrifices in carrying out this struggle. The newspaper pointed out that every struggle involves sacrifices.

"Indonesia Raya" said that Hatta's article has its positive elements, but these elements "are overshadowed by opinions that are detrimental to our people in the current struggle."

The newspaper went on to say that Hatta's statement that the government does not have an appropriate plan in carrying out the struggle to recover West Irian is untrue. The newspaper also said, "Overall, we believe that Hatta's arguments are almost unacceptable."

"Bintang Timur" wrote that Hatta does not want to promote the struggle to recover West Irian, citing the excuse that the people do not need to endure sacrifices. The suffering that the Indonesian people are currently forced to endure is the result of the actions taken by Dutch colonialists. The newspaper also pointed out that Indonesia has not yet freed itself from the shackles imposed on Indonesia by the Round Table Conference. (Attached picture)

    朱安达总理谈收复西伊里安斗争
    印度尼西亚政府有明确计划
    新华社雅加达29日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚总理朱安达28日下午透露，他对于一些雅加达报纸28日发表的前副总统哈达写的关于西伊里安斗争和它同人民生活水平的关系的文章感到非常遗憾。朱安达并且驳斥了一些人士发表的、得到哈达鼓励的言论，这些言论说，似乎政府在西伊里安斗争中没有明确的计划。
    朱安达是在回答记者的问题时这样说的。记者问，政府对哈达文章的反应怎样。哈达的文章主要是说，政府在进行西伊里安斗争时没有明确的计划，并且不同意政府在此以前所做的事情。
    朱安达总理在驳斥哈达的批评的时候举出了一个事实，就是已经成立了一些像关于废除圆桌会议协定、限制荷兰企业的利润转移等机构，拟订了外国投资法案，最近的全国建设会议还通过了关于西伊里安问题的决议。全国建设会议是由哈达亲自主持的。
    朱安达总理进一步说，政府采取的措施只是为了实现上述的事情。他又说，措施已经加速进行。
    朱安达说，“我不同意哈达的声明，因为关于废除圆桌会议协定的国家委员会老早就存在了。我们现在所追求的只是实现废除圆桌会议协定。”朱安达说，所有的计划老早就准备好了。
    这位总理谈到了全国建设会议的决议。关于经济问题的一项决议清楚地说明要接管或者没收和监督、或者管理包括航运公司在内的荷兰企业，并且取消同意无形收入的转移。这位总理说，在目前，我们并没有摒除和荷兰关系正常化的可能性。因此，我们还没有没收荷兰的所有企业。朱安达也提醒说，在全国建设会议上已经决定断绝和荷兰的贸易关系，并且限制荷兰人在印度尼西亚的行动和利益。
    朱安达总理说，“在事先六个月把关于要采取的措施向荷兰人提出警告，那是太幼稚了。如果我们依照哈达的意见，我们可能在三十年内也不会采取任何行动。”
    这位总理证实工人在政府采取行动以前就采取了行动，但是他说，工人所以采取这些行动是由于有迹象表明，荷兰企业主将使情况严重起来。
    新华社雅加达30日电　雅加达的许多家报纸今天发表社论，评论印度尼西亚前副总统哈达的文章和内阁总理朱安达就哈达文章发表的谈话。
    “社会使者报”写道，争取收复西伊里安的斗争不是只同某一个集团或某一个社会阶层有关的事，在这个斗争中，所有力量都应该团结起来，一切的反对都应该避免。
    “社会使者报”说，“朱安达的谈话对那些愿意了解事情真相的人说来是十分清楚的”，“我们的责任是对政府所采取的措施和步骤进行协助”。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”表示不同意哈达在他的文章中所说的在进行这一斗争中人民不必要忍受牺牲的说法。这家报纸指出，每一个斗争都是有牺牲的。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”说，哈达的文章有它的积极因素，但是，这些因素“被那些对在目前的斗争中的我们人民不利的意见遮盖住了”。
    这家报纸接着说，哈达说政府在进行争取收复西伊里安的斗争中没有适当的计划，这是不真实的。报纸还说，“总的说来，我们认为哈达的论点是几乎无法被接受的”。
    “东星报”写道，哈达并不希望促进争取收复西伊里安的斗争，借口是人民不必要忍受牺牲。印度尼西亚人民目前被迫忍受的痛苦是荷兰殖民主义者采取的行动的结果。报纸还指出，印度尼西亚还没有摆脱圆桌会议所加于印度尼西亚的束缚。（附图片）
