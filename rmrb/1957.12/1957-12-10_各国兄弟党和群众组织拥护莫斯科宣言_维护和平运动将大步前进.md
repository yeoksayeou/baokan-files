Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 9th: A meeting of labor party activists was held in Tirana. The meeting was addressed by Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, who reported on the results of the Moscow meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties and the recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the Labor Party. It also adopted a resolution expressing unanimous support for the two documents of the Moscow meeting.

In his report, Hoxha pointed out that the two meetings in Moscow demonstrated the close cooperation and sincere relations among the fraternal parties united on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. He also emphasized that the Moscow meeting itself marked the steel-like unity of the communist and workers' parties of the world with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the leading force of the socialist camp. Strengthening the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and strengthening the unity of the international communist movement are the basic tasks of the communist and workers' parties of the world. The Albanian Labor Party has always struggled and will continue to struggle forever for the unity of the socialist camp and the communist and workers' parties of the world, which is the basic condition for winning socialism and promoting world peace.

Hoxha's report concluded by emphasizing that the recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the Labor Party fully endorsed the declaration and the peace manifesto, and called on all levels of party organizations to conduct in-depth discussions on the two declarations and take them as a guide for their entire actions.

Mass organizations and working people in Albania have held meetings and discussions on the two Moscow declarations. During the discussions, everyone expressed their willingness to contribute all their strength to realize the tasks stipulated in the two declarations.

Aidit said that these two declarations will surely be welcomed by people who do not want war.

Aidit also said that the peace manifesto points out the most urgent issue to the people of the world, which is that the testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs must be prohibited, and the manufacture and use of these weapons must be unconditionally prohibited.

Bulgarian Mass Organizations Declare
　Calling for the Launch of Socialist Emulation

The Central Committee of the Youth League also emphasized in its statement that it is necessary to hold higher the banner of Marxism-Leninism, to conduct an irreconcilable struggle for a high degree of ideological awareness, against the influence of bourgeois ideas and revisionist ideas infiltrating individual local youth, and at the same time not to underestimate the harmfulness of dogmatism and sectarianism. The statement called on youth league organizations at all levels to do their best to strengthen the work of Marxist-Leninist propaganda and education among young people. (Attached picture)
