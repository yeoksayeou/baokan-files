Xinhua News Agency, December 1st, Kuala Lumpur dispatch: According to newspaper reports, the Federation of Malaya continues to suppress Chinese middle school students who are demanding that the government revise its education policy. As of November 28th, nearly sixty students have been arrested, thirty-nine students have been ordered to be expelled by the government authorities, and the government authorities have also banned three schools that refused to hand over student blacklists from resuming classes.

The suppression action by the authorities of the Federation of Malaya has been opposed by Chinese middle school students in various places. Students from more than ten Chinese middle schools in Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Johor Bahru, Muar and Labis in Johor, and Alor Setar in Kedah have held rallies in recent days to protest the government's suppression measures.

In the capital, Kuala Lumpur, students from four Chinese middle schools also launched a signature campaign to protest the authorities' use of the "Emergency Regulations" to arrest students in large numbers and force schools to submit blacklists to expel students.

Among the eighteen Penang students who are still being detained by the government authorities, nine have been on a hunger strike in prison since November 26 to protest. Student parents met with Penang Chief Minister Wong Pow Nee on November 27 to demand the release of the arrested students.

Ramanathan, Chairman of the Labour Party of Malaya, issued a statement on November 26, saying that the Labour Party is disturbed by the tendency of the government's education policy and believes that arresting students by citing the "Emergency Regulations" is an act of suppression. He believes that the students have reason to oppose the expulsion of "over-aged" students and to oppose forcing Chinese middle school students to take exams in English.

　  马来亚当局继续镇压学生
　　各地华文中学学生群起反对
    据新华社1日讯　吉隆坡消息：据报纸报道，马来亚联合邦继续镇压要求政府修改教育政策的华文中学学生。到11月28日止，已经有近六十名学生被捕，三十九名学生被政府当局下令开除学籍，政府当局还禁止三所拒绝交出学生黑名单的学校复课。
    马来亚联合邦当局这一镇压行动遭到了各地华文中学学生的反对。吉隆坡、槟榔屿、柔佛州的新山、麻坡和利丰港以及吉打州的亚罗士打等地的十多所华文中学的学生在最近几天来先后举行了集会，抗议政府的压制措施。
    在首都吉隆坡，四所华文中学的学生还发起了一个签名运动，抗议当局引用“紧急法令”大批逮捕学生和强迫学校提出黑名单来开除学生。
    在十八名被政府当局继续拘留的槟榔屿学生中，有九名从11月26日开始在狱中绝食抗议。学生家长在11月27日会见槟榔屿首席部长王保尼，要求释放被捕学生。
    马来亚联合邦劳工党主席拉马纳坦11月26日发表声明说，劳工党对于政府的教育政策的倾向感到不安，并且认为引用“紧急法令”逮捕学生是一种压制行为。他认为学生们是有理由反对开除“超龄”学生和反对强制华文中学学生用英文参加考试的。
