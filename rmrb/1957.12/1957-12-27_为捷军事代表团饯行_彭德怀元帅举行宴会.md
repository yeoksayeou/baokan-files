At the banquet, Marshal Peng Dehuai said that the Czechoslovak Republic Military Delegation is concluding its visit to our country and will return home tomorrow. The Chinese people and army highly respect the achievements and experiences of the Czechoslovak People's Army in the anti-fascist war, in socialist construction, and in consolidating national defense and strengthening military and political construction. All of these are not only gratifying to us, but also worthy of our learning.

Marshal Peng Dehuai congratulated the comrades of the delegation on achieving brilliant successes in all their work in the coming year of 1958.

He said that this visit by the delegation has further consolidated and strengthened this bond and contributed to the unity of the socialist camp.
