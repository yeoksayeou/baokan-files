Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 27th: Recently, North Korea held public trial rallies in Tieyuan, Xingnan, Huangzhou, and other places, severely suppressing a batch of counter-revolutionaries and spies sent by American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique. On December 23rd, the public trial in Xingnan heard the case of Cui Haozhong, a spy dispatched by American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique. This spy crossed the military demarcation line in September of last year to gather military and economic intelligence in northern Korea. The Korean government had previously arrested and released him. However, after his release, this spy continued to engage in espionage activities and plotted to organize armed riots in the Xingnan area. This time, he was severely suppressed.

On December 24th, the counter-revolutionary Cui Huangyi was publicly tried in Tieyuan. On November 18th, the counter-revolutionaries Xu Zaiwen and An Yingji were publicly tried in Huangzhou. They were all executioners who massacred a large number of patriotic people during the war. After the war, they hid in state organs and agricultural cooperatives. They were recently exposed during investigations and were sentenced to death this time.
