Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 28th - The improvement project on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, which is over two thousand kilometers long, has been largely completed.

After the improvement, the Qinghai-Tibet Highway has been shortened due to straightening of curves, and the roadbed has been widened to ten meters. Although it crosses the world-renowned Kunlun Mountains and Tanggula (Mountains) and passes through many rivers in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Nujiang River, there are no hairpin turns or gradients exceeding 5% along the entire route, allowing the passage of trailers and gas-powered vehicles. Now, taking a car from Xia Dong Station on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway or from Xining, it only takes about ten days to reach Lhasa.

The area through which this highway passes averages around 4,000 meters above sea level, a desolate and uninhabited alpine region. Now, more than one hundred road maintenance crew outposts and rest stops have been built along the entire route. With fixed "households," some nomadic Tibetans are also concentrating here during the grazing season. Many new settlements have emerged along the route.

Since the Qinghai-Tibet Highway opened to traffic on December 25, 1954, the volume of transportation has increased year by year, and the original highway needed improvement. Several thousand workers of Han, Tibetan, Hui, and other ethnic groups, after more than a year of hard work, finally transformed a highway that was initially small in scale into an artery connecting the motherland's interior to Tibet.

### 青藏公路改善工程大部完成  从西宁到拉萨只走十天

    青藏公路改善工程大部完成
    从西宁到拉萨只走十天
    据新华社西宁28日电　全长两千多公里的青藏公路，改善工程已经大部完成。
    改善后的青藏公路，由于截弯取直里程比原来缩短了，路基加宽到十公尺。它虽然跨过世界闻名的昆仑山和唐古拉（山）等山脉，穿过长江和怒江上游的许多河流，但是全线没有一个回头弯道和超过5％的坡度，可以行驶拖车和煤气车。现在，从兰新铁路的峡东站或是从西宁乘坐汽车，十天左右就可到达拉萨。
    这条公路经过的地区，平均都在拔海四千公尺左右荒无人烟的高寒地带，现在，全线已修了一百多处的道班房和食宿站。因为有了固定的“人家”，一些游牧的藏民，也在牧放季节向这里集中。沿线已经出现了许多新居民点。
    青藏公路从1954年12月25日通车以来，运输量逐年加大，原来的公路必须改善。几千名汉、藏、回等族职工，经过一年多的艰苦劳动，终于把一条初具规模的公路，变为从祖国内地通向西藏的动脉。
