Xinhua News Agency, New York: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, after hearing the speech by Soviet representative Kuznetzov on the 12th, immediately began discussing the Soviet proposal.

    The head of the Burmese delegation, U Thant, spoke. He expressed his conviction that peaceful coexistence among nations is the most important and pressing issue of our time. He said that his delegation fully agreed with the draft declaration proposed by the Soviet Union. There is no alternative to peaceful coexistence, which means that people, regardless of their beliefs, should learn to live in peace with all their neighbors. The Burmese representative cited Burma's relations with China as an example of the effective implementation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He said, "We firmly believe that if all countries abide by these five principles in their relations, peace will be guaranteed."
    Polish representative Winiewicz pointed out that despite the efforts of many countries, not even the first step of a disarmament agreement had been taken at this session of the General Assembly. He called on the UN to resolve all outstanding issues through negotiations based on the principles of peaceful coexistence. The Polish representative also spoke about the importance of the proposal made by the Polish delegation at the beginning of the meeting that East Germany, West Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia should not produce or store nuclear weapons.
    Finnish representative R. Enckell pointed out in his speech that the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland are an example of relations between countries with different political, economic, and social systems. He said that the Soviet-Finnish Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance reflects the principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs and also reflects Finland's neutrality.

    和平共处是当代最重要的问题
    缅波芬三国赞成苏联提案
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会12日会议在听取了苏联代表库兹?佐夫的发言后，即就苏联的提案进行讨论。
    缅甸代表团团长吴丹发言。他表示确信，各国和平共处是当代最重要和最迫切的问题。他说，他的代表团完全同意苏联提出的宣言草案。除了和平共处没有其他的选择，这就是说，人们不管信仰如何，都应当学会同自己的所有邻居和平相处。缅甸代表举出了缅甸同中国的关系作为有成效地实现和平共处五项原则的例子。他说，“我们坚信，如果所有国家都在自己的关系中遵守这五项原则，和平将会得到保证。”
    波兰代表维尼维奇指出，虽然有许多国家的努力，但在本届联大会议上甚至连裁军协议的第一个步骤也没作到。他呼吁联大各国根据和平共处原则通过谈判来解决一切悬而未决的问题。波兰代表还谈到会议开始时，波兰代表团提出的东德、西德、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克不生产和不储存核武器建议的重要性。
    芬兰代表鲁·恩克尔在发言中指出，苏联和芬兰之间的友好关系是不同政治、经济和社会制度的国家之间的关系的榜样。他说苏芬友好、合作和互助条约反映了互不干涉国家内政的原则，也反映了芬兰的中立原则。
