Preparing Coal Faces and Arranging Mechanical Transport Equipment
Kailuan Readies Many Production Links

(Our report) According to the Tangshan Labor Daily: Kailuan Coal Mine is stepping up its production preparation for next year to ensure the country produces more coal next year.

At present, all mines have reserved a large number of coal faces. The amount of coal obtained from completed tunneling can supply mining for an average of more than six months next year. In the tunneling construction in preparation for next year's production, in addition to trying every means to improve tunneling efficiency and reduce ineffective footage, the workers paid special attention to improving the engineering quality of the faces, creating favorable conditions for implementing the policy of more, faster, better, more economical, and safer. Tangjiazhuang Mine plans to extract coal from thin coal seams that will account for more than 30% of the mine's total output next year. The workers have not only overcome the difficulties of tunneling in thin coal seams, but also completed the coal chutes and ventilation roadways in all the faces that have been excavated in advance. They will be put into production immediately at the beginning of next year. Tangshan Mine expanded the area of some ventilation roadways, making the air volume in the mine smooth, which will play a good role in next year's safe production.

Various mines have also put forward many improvement methods on how to make full use of coal mining machinery and improve transportation efficiency. The utilization rate of electric chutes in Tangjiazhuang Mine's production this year was not high. Now, learning from this lesson, the mine has completely leveled and straightened the roadways of the faces and extended the working face. The length of each electric chute used next year can be increased by 10 to 20 meters compared to this year. Linxi Mine adjusted the mechanical equipment and extracted the redundant electric chutes and cables to install them on the faces to be mined next year. These faces are ready and can be put into production at any time.

    储备采煤工作面　安排机械运输设备
    开滦许多生产环节准备停当
    本报讯　据唐山劳动日报报道：开滦煤矿正在加紧进行明年的生产准备工作，保证在明年为国家生产更多的煤炭。
    目前，各矿已经储备了大量的采煤工作面，完成掘进的获得煤量平均可供明年开采六个月以上。在为明年生产作准备的掘进施工中，职工们除想尽办法提高掘进效率，减少无效进尺以外，特别注意提高掌子的工程质量，为贯彻又多、又快、又好、又省、又安全的方针创造有利条件。唐家庄矿明年从薄煤层开采的煤占全矿总产量30％以上，职工们不但克服了在薄煤层掘进的困难，还把所有已经掘出的掌子都提前作好了放煤小井和通风顺槽，明年年初马上就可投入生产。唐山矿扩大了部分通风巷道的面积，使井下的风量通畅，对明年安全生产将起很好的作用。
    各个矿还对如何充分利用采煤机械和提高运输效率，提出了许多改进的办法。唐家庄矿今年生产中电溜子利用率不高，现在接受这个教训，把掌子的顺槽完全作平作直，并且延长工作面，明年每部电溜子使用的长度可比今年提高十公尺到二十公尺。林西矿调整了机械设备，抽出多余的电溜子和电缆安装到明年开采的掌子上，这些掌子准备妥当，随时都可投入生产。
