　　When Children Ask Questions
　　Cao Shu

During the developmental stage, children feel new about everything around them. They want to see everything and know everything, and often ask a series of questions about things that seem very ordinary: What is this? Why is that? Why does the wind blow? Why does it rain? Why do hens lay eggs? Why can cars run...?

These countless questions from children often embarrass or even annoy parents. Some parents simply refuse to answer their children's questions: "Always 'why, why,' it's so annoying!" "Don't ask, you wouldn't understand even if I told you, go play by yourself!" This approach is obviously wrong.

Every "Why?" that children ask should be carefully listened to and clearly answered by parents, which is important for developing children's intelligence and cultivating their desire for knowledge.

How to answer children's questions?

The most important thing is that parents must answer children's questions with the greatest patience and a serious attitude. Some questions raised by children are often naive and laughable, but from their innocent faces and eyes waiting for answers, we can see how strong their interest and desire for knowledge are about things they don't understand. Parents must not laugh at their children because their questions are naive, let alone refuse to answer or perfunctorily answer them with a cold and indifferent attitude. This will not only frustrate children's desire for knowledge, but also make them lack self-confidence, and they will not dare to ask questions in the future. Parents should take a great interest in any small question raised by their children, adopt a kind and caring attitude, try their best to meet their needs, and correctly guide their interests.

The content of children's questions is various. When answering questions, parents should base their answers on the age characteristics and developmental status of children, and take into account their existing life experiences and knowledge levels, making simple, clear, and easy-to-understand answers. For younger children, the answers should be more concise, without saying things that children do not understand, and without listing things that children do not understand. Some parents want to make their children understand more things, so when children ask questions, they give many lengthy and complicated answers, which instead make children unable to correctly understand the problem. The answer to a child's question should be as simple and clear as possible. For example:

When a child is on the street with his mother, he sees a cleaning car and asks his mother:

"What kind of car is this?"

"Cleaning car."

"What does cleaning mean?"

"Cleaning means tidying up the dirty things on the street—like fruit peels, fallen leaves."

Look, what a kind, gentle, concise, and organized answer. The child has a clear understanding of the problem from here, because fallen leaves and fruit peels are things the child has seen in life, and he can easily understand them. At the same time, children can be educated in a timely manner, telling him not to litter. This can cultivate children's respect for working people and develop good habits.

Not every question raised by children needs to be answered immediately. Some questions are asked by children without thinking. For these questions, parents don't need to rush to answer. They should let the children think for themselves, inspire and guide them to consider the problem and find the answer. This will promote the development of children's intelligence, enable them to actively use their existing knowledge and experience, broaden their horizons, and develop good habits of thinking for themselves and not relying on others. Some questions are completely unnecessary to answer. For example, if a child has some accidental questions, he forgets them quickly after asking, so there is no need to answer them. Some very complex questions are not easily understood by children. If answered, it will only confuse the child. For these questions, parents can try to shift the child's interest, avoid answering, or explain to the child that many things will be understood when he grows up.

The process of answering children's questions is also the process of educating children. Therefore, parents should use every question to cultivate their moral qualities of loving the motherland, loving labor, loving science, loving knowledge, and protecting public property.

### 当孩子们发问的时候

　　当孩子们发问的时候
　　曹述
    儿童在发育时期，对周围的各种事物和现象都感到新鲜。他们什么都想看，什么都想知道，常常对许多看来十分平常的事情，提出一连串的问题：这是什么？那是为什么？为什么刮风？为什么下雨？为什么母鸡会生蛋？为什么汽车能够跑……。
    孩子们这些数不尽的问题常常会使父母感到困窘，甚至厌烦。有些家长干脆拒绝答复孩子的问题：“老是‘为什么，为什么’，讨厌死了！”“别问了，告诉你也不懂，自己玩去吧！”这种作法显然是不对的。
    孩子们提出的每一个“为什么？”，做父母的都应该注意倾听，明确地回答，这对发展孩子的智力，培养孩子的求知欲有重要作用。
    怎样解答孩子的问题呢？
    最主要的，是父母必须用最大的耐心和庄重的态度来回答孩子们的问题。孩子们提出的有些问题，往往是幼稚可笑的，但是从他们那副天真的面孔和等待回答的眼睛里可以看出，他们对自己不了解的事物有着多么浓厚的兴趣和强烈的求知欲。做父母的千万不要因为孩子的问题幼稚而嘲笑他们，更不能拒绝不答或者用冷淡和漫不经心的态度进行敷衍。这样，不仅会挫伤孩子求知的欲望，而且会使他们变得缺乏自信心，以后有了问题也不敢问了。父母对待孩子的任何一个细小的问题，都应该抱着极大的兴趣，采取亲切和关心的态度，尽可能地满足他们的要求，并且正确地引导他们的兴趣。
    孩子提出问题的内容是各种各样的，做父母的在回答问题的时候，要根据儿童的年龄特点和发育情况，并且照顾到他们已有的生活经验和知识水平，作出简单、明确、通俗易懂的回答。对于年龄愈小的孩子，就要回答得愈加简要，不说孩子不懂的话，不列举孩子所不懂的事物。有些做父母的想尽量使孩子懂得更多的事情，于是当孩子发问的时候，作很多冗长而复杂的回答，反而使孩子不能正确地认识问题。回答孩子的问题，要尽量简单明了。例如：
    孩子跟妈妈上街的时候，看见了一辆清洁车，他问妈妈：
    “这是什么车？”
    “清洁车。”
    “什么叫清洁？”
    “清洁就是把街道上不干净的东西——像果皮啦，落叶啦，收拾干净。”
    看，这是多么慈祥、温和、简洁而有条理的回答。孩子从这里对问题有了简明的了解，因为落叶和果皮是孩子生活中见过的东西，他容易理解。同时还可以及时对孩子进行教育，告诉他别把脏东西乱扔。这既可以培养孩子对劳动人民的尊敬，又能培养孩子的良好习惯。
  对于孩子们的问题，并不是每一个都要立即回答的。孩子有些问题是不加思索就发问的，对于这些问题，父母不必忙着答复，应该让小孩子自己想一想，启发和诱导他们去考虑问题，找出答案。这样就会促进儿童智力的发展，使他们积极地利用自己已有的知识和经验，扩大眼界，养成自己动脑筋、不依赖别人的好习惯。有些问题，是完全不必要回答的。例如，孩子发生了一些偶然的问题，他发问以后很快地又把它忘记了，这就不需要再回答。有些十分复杂的问题是不容易被孩子所了解的，如果回答了反而会使孩子更加糊涂。对于这些问题，做父母的可以设法转移孩子的兴趣，避免回答或者向孩子说明，等他长大以后许多事情都会了解的。
    回答孩子问题的过程，也就是对孩子进行教育的过程。因此，做父母的应该通过每一个问题，培养他们热爱祖国、爱劳动、爱科学、爱知识和爱护公共财物的道德品质。
