    (III)
    The Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties notes with satisfaction that the communist movement has developed, become more consolidated after many severe tests, and achieved a series of brilliant victories.
    Before the October Revolution, only Russia had a Communist Party. The forty years since the October Revolution have been a victory for the communist movement and for Marxism-Leninism. In 1920, there were twenty-seven Communist Parties; in 1939, this increased to forty-three, with 4.2 million members. During the Second World War and the postwar years, thirty-two new Communist Parties were established. Currently, Communist Parties are fighting in seventy-five countries, with more than 33 million members.
    These figures eloquently demonstrate that the development of the communist movement is becoming increasingly widespread and profound, extending to all continents and almost all countries in the world.
    The postwar period has seen a particularly vigorous development of the communist movement.
    The main victory of communism during this period is the historic victory achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party. The working class and its long tested revolutionary parties in countries like Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia have seized political power.
    During this period, the Communist Parties in many capitalist countries have become mass parties of the working class and have begun to play an important role in the political life of their countries. The French Communist Party has almost 500,000 members, and the Italian Communist Party has nearly 2 million members. These two parties lead the basic masses of the working class, and on a series of major issues, they receive the support of the majority of the country.
    The communist movement in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East has greatly developed. Before the war, there were only tens of thousands of communists in these countries. Now, the ranks of the Communist Parties in Southeast Asian countries have 1.7 million members, and the Communist Parties in Latin American countries have a total of more than 200,000 members. Communist Parties in countries like India, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina, Japan, Chile, Syria, and Lebanon have gained high prestige among the masses of people in their countries.
    The fact that the number of votes received by Communist Parties in capitalist countries in parliamentary elections has increased shows that the prestige of the Communist Party is growing. The Communist Parties in only four countries—France, Italy, India, and Indonesia—received a total of nearly 32 million votes in recent elections.
    Reactionary groups have tried their best to prevent the growth of the Communist Party's influence and prevent them from working among the masses. The vast majority of fraternal parties in capitalist countries—thirty-three out of sixty-two—still have to operate in secret. In recent years, some countries have also promulgated particularly brutal anti-communist regulations. One anti-communist wave after another occurred at the command of Washington. This wave was particularly fierce in the years when the Korean War and the Hungarian Incident broke out. During the days of the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary, the editorial offices and party organizations of Communist newspapers in France, Italy, Austria, the Netherlands, and other countries were attacked by mobs. As before the Second World War, bills to ban the Communist Party were introduced in the parliaments of many countries, communists were dismissed en masse, and police repression was greatly strengthened.
    Reactionary forces use terror, persecution, and vilification to deal with communists, making the activities of the Communist Party difficult, but they cannot stop the growth of the Communist Party's power. In the past year, the reactionaries have attempted to slander the Communist Party, attempting to isolate it from the people and defeat it. What was the result? All Communist Parties withstood the attacks of the reactionaries and preserved their cadres and basic party members. Most Communist Parties have become stronger after severe tests. The newspapers of monopoly organizations cheered at the departure of unstable elements from the party. But the enemy's cheers are in vain. The cleansing of the Communist Party's ranks of opportunists, speculators, unstable elements, and vacillators has not weakened, but strengthened the Communist Party.
    It is important to point out that new forces have been added to the ranks of the Communist Party, mainly workers who have undergone severe tests of class struggle. In the past year, the French Communist Party has added 20,000 new members, the Indian Communist Party has added 70,000, the Argentine Communist Party has added about 30,000, and the Italian Communist Party has added more than 90,000. The congresses and conferences successfully held by the Communist Parties of twenty countries in recent times have shown the unity of the Communist Party's ranks, their loyalty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and the Moscow meeting has convincingly demonstrated the international solidarity of the communist movement.
    Our enemies were clamoring about a "crisis of communism" a year ago, and now they have to admit the strength and unity of the communist movement. On November 27, 1956, the American "New York Times," following Mr. Dulles, asserted that "the conclusion that the communist world is currently undergoing the most serious crisis in its entire history is unavoidable." After a year, the tone of the same "New York Times" has changed. It wrote: "It can be seen from the declaration that the prestige of the Soviet Union and the unity of communism have achieved great success. ..." The bourgeois propaganda machine has thus had to admit that the argument of a "crisis of communism" has once again gone bankrupt.
    In the course of its development, the communist movement inevitably encounters various difficulties. Its history has seen periods of rapid upsurge and achievement, as well as temporary low tides. But the low tides of the communist movement are temporary, while its growth and consolidation are the objective laws of historical development.
    The Communist Party exposes and openly criticizes its own weaknesses, errors, and shortcomings in order to further consolidate its ranks ideologically and organizationally.
    In the current situation, an important task of the Communist Party is to wage a struggle against revisionism—a struggle against opportunist trends in the workers' and communist movements. Revisionism is a serious danger to the communist movement, meaning ideological surrender to capitalism. Revisionists agree with capitalist thinkers on many important issues, helping them in their struggle against Marxism-Leninism.
    To obliterate or underestimate the aggressive essence of imperialism, to underestimate the danger of new wars planned by the American aggressive bloc and its accomplices, is typical of contemporary revisionism. The most blatant revisionists are characterized by embellishing the ugliness of modern capitalism, not criticizing capitalism, denying the basic laws of class struggle, advocating class cooperation, and denying that the working class can use other forms of struggle besides parliamentary and trade union activities to win political power and the victory of socialism. Revisionists set some Communist Parties against other Communist Parties. They actually abandon the principle of proletarian internationalism and roll onto the position of "national communism."
    The Marxist-Leninist doctrine on a party of a new type is one of the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism. Marxism-Leninism teaches us that only a party of a new type can lead the working class and the masses of people, instill socialist consciousness in them, organize them, and guide them to victory. And the facts have also proved this.
    Now everyone recognizes the great achievements of the Soviet Union. It is precisely because of the Communist Party's correct Marxist-Leninist policy that the Soviet people overcame the numerous difficulties set in their path by domestic and foreign reactionaries and finally achieved the victory of socialism. The strength of the Soviet people, the strength of the Chinese people, and the strength of the people of socialist countries lie in their unity around their respective Communist Parties and in the Communist Party leading their struggles.
    Now the bourgeoisie also knows very well that the strength of the working class lies in the Communist Party established by this class. Therefore, bourgeois thinkers attack the Communist Party with their main force. It is beneficial to the bourgeoisie that revisionists advocate abandoning Lenin's principle of democratic centralism, advocating turning the Communist Party from a fighting revolutionary organization into an organization like a talking club.
    Lenin taught that a new type of party should be armed with advanced revolutionary theory, should absorb the best sons and daughters of the working class and other working people into its ranks, and should become a party that is closely connected with the masses and able to work in all strata of the people, to be the vanguard of the masses, to educate the masses, to organize the masses, and to lead the struggle of the masses.
    Fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries, while repelling revisionist views, are taking measures to strengthen their ranks ideologically and organizationally. Among these measures, strengthening the backbone of the party's worker composition, more boldly promoting workers to leadership positions, expanding the network of production groups, improving the ideological education of Communist Party members, improving the ideological level of Communist Party newspapers, fighting to thoroughly overcome revisionist and sectarian tendencies, and formulating practical ways to connect with the masses are of the greatest significance.
    Communist Parties in various countries are discussing the results of meetings. The Central Committees recently held by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the Communist Party of Bulgaria, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Albanian Party of Labor, the Workers' Party of Korea, and the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party unanimously approved these two declarations and determined measures to implement them. The leading bodies of the Communist Parties of France, Italy, Britain, Austria, Japan, and other countries announced their full support for the resolutions of the Moscow meeting. These resolutions inspire their activities in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.
    (IV)
    Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries are faced with great historical tasks. In order to accomplish these tasks, not only is the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties themselves needed, but also the unity of the entire working class, the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, the unity of all working people and progressive humanity, and the unity of all freedom-loving and peace-loving forces in the world.
    Now, when the world socialist system has become a powerful force and socialist ideas have grasped the minds of millions of people, it is important to correctly interpret the ways of transition to socialism.
    In the current situation, there are more favorable conditions for the victory of socialism. The working class and its vanguard—the Marxist-Leninist Party—strive to achieve socialist revolution in a peaceful way. Doing so is in the interests of the working class and all the people, as well as in the interests of the entire nation. In some capitalist countries, the working class and its advanced forces may be able to unite the majority of the people on the basis of the workers' front and the people's front, on the basis of agreements between various political parties and social organizations and other forms of political cooperation, to seize state power without civil war, thereby ensuring that basic means of production are transferred into the hands of the people. However, all of this can only be achieved through extensive and continuous class struggle by the workers, peasants, and urban middle class against big monopoly capital, against reactionaries, for profound social reforms, for peace and socialism.
    At the same time, the declaration emphasizes that under the conditions where the exploiting classes use violence against the people, another possibility must be considered, that is, a non-peaceful transition to socialism. There is no insurmountable gap between peaceful and non-peaceful methods of transition to socialism. Under various different historical conditions, one or the other possibility may exist in a country—one must flexibly determine one's own tactics and must consider the balance of forces within a country and on an international scale. However, as the strength of socialism is further strengthened, the possibility of a peaceful transition to socialism will undoubtedly continue to increase.
    Clarifying the question of the method of transition to socialism has great theoretical and political significance. It reminds communists and the working class once again that they must master all forms of struggle—peaceful and non-peaceful, parliamentary and extra-parliamentary—so that they can adopt the most suitable method at any time according to the specific historical conditions.
    The declaration and peace manifesto adopted by the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties also call on social democratic parties, and the two declarations clarify the program for cooperation between the two basic factions of the modern workers' movement.
    In the most representative meeting in its history, the Communist Party, in the name of the Communist Parties of socialist countries and in the name of the entire international communist movement, extends its hand to its class brothers—the social democrats—and renews its call for cooperation. This adds special force and meaning to the call for cooperation. Refusing to cooperate with the Communist Party will be regarded by all honest people as refusing to fight to save humanity from the threat of nuclear war, refusing to protect the most urgent demands of the working class and all working people. Therefore, it must be believed that the documents of the Moscow meeting will be understood by the majority of social democratic party members and will strengthen the trend now emerging in the ranks of social democratic parties that calls for concerted action with communists to protect the interests of the working class and peace among the peoples of all countries.
    Communists advocate establishing cooperation with social democrats to strive to improve the living conditions of the working people, expand and defend their democratic rights, strive for and defend national independence, and strive for world peace and social progress. The results of parliamentary elections have proven that in many countries, more than 40% of voters vote for communists and social democrats. In France, Italy, and Latin American countries, large-scale strike battles are being launched under the banner of strengthening the unity of the working class. The joint efforts of supporters of the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party will help establish a powerful united front against monopoly capital, help greatly change the balance of power in parliaments in many countries, and help establish left-wing governments, thereby promoting the struggle for socialism.
    The Moscow Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties identified the historically significant problems facing the workers' movement and the communist movement at this stage.
    In the current class struggle, the vigorous strength of Lenin's principle of building a new type of party has once again been confirmed. The revolutionary party of the working class, armed with Marxist-Leninist scientific thought, based on the principle of democratic centralism, and having broad and close ties with the working masses, is the soul and brain of the modern progressive movement, all current liberation struggles, and anti-imperialist struggles. The ideological and organizational strengthening of the Communist Party is the guarantee of winning new victories in the struggle for peace and socialism.

　　共产党和工人党的团结一致
　　苏联“真理报”编辑部
    （三）
    共产党和工人党代表会议满意地指出，共产主义运动发展了，经过许多严重考验以后更加巩固了，获得了一系列辉煌胜利。
    十月革命以前，只有俄国有共产党。十月革命以后的四十年是共产主义运动的胜利，是马克思列宁主义的胜利。1920年有二十七个共产党，1939年增加到四十三个，有党员四百二十万。在第二次世界大战时期和战后年代里又新成立了三十二个共产党。目前，共产党在七十五个国家里进行斗争，有党员三千三百多万。
    这些数字雄辩地说明，共产主义运动的发展越来越是广泛、越是深入，它已经遍及到各大洲和几乎世界上一切国家。
    战后时期，共产主义运动的发展特别蓬勃。
    共产主义在这个时期的主要胜利是，中国人民在光荣的中国共产党的领导下取得了历史性的胜利，阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、越南民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克和南斯拉夫等国的工人阶级及其久经考验的革命政党取得了政权。
    许多资本主义国家的共产党在这个时期变成了工人阶级的群众性政党，并且在本国的政治生活中开始起着重要的作用。法国共产党几乎有五十万党员，意大利共产党将近有二百万党员，这两个党领导着工人阶级的基本群众，而在一系列的重大问题上则得到全国大多数的支持。
    东南亚、拉丁美洲和中近东各国的共产主义运动有了很大的发展。战前这些国家里只有数万共产党人，现在，东南亚国家共产党的队伍里已经有一百七十万党员、拉丁美洲国家的共产党共有二十多万党员。印度、印度尼西亚、巴西、阿根廷、日本、智利、叙利亚和黎巴嫩和一系列其他国家的共产党在本国人民群众中获得了很高的威信。
    资本主义国家共产党人在议会选举中选票增加的事实说明共产党的威信日益增长。仅法国、意大利、印度和印度尼西亚四个国家的共产党在最近的选举中总共就获得了几乎三千二百万张选票。
    反动集团竭力阻止共产党影响的增长，使它们不能在群众中进行工作。资本主义国家的兄弟党绝大部分——六十二个党当中的三十三个——直到现在还不得不处于秘密状态。最近几年来，一些国家还颁布了特别残酷的反共条例。华盛顿一声号令，反共浪潮一个接着一个发生，在朝鲜战争和匈牙利事件爆发的岁月里，这股浪潮特别凶猛。在匈牙利发生反革命暴乱的日子里，法国、意大利、奥地利、荷兰以及其他国家共产党报刊编辑部和党组织的楼房都曾受到暴徒袭击。像第二次世界大战前夕那样，许多国家的议会有人提出了禁止共产党的法案，共产党人大批被解雇，警察镇压大大加强。
    反动势力用恐怖、迫害和攻讦等手段来对付共产党员，使共产党的活动遭到困难，但是他们却挡不住共产党势力的增长。去年一年内，反动派企图诽谤共产党，企图把共产党同人民隔离起来加以击溃。结果如何呢？一切共产党都经受住了反动派的打击，保存了自己的干部和基本党员群众。大多数共产党经过严重考验之后变得更加坚强了。垄断组织的报纸看到不稳定分子退党而欢呼。但是敌人的欢呼是徒然的。共产党的队伍清除了机会主义分子、投机分子、不稳定分子和动摇分子，这并没有削弱、而是加强了共产党。
    指出这一点是很重要的：共产党的队伍中增加了新的力量，主要是经过阶级斗争严重考验的工人。一年来，法国共产党增加了二万新党员，印度共产党增加了七万，阿根廷共产党增加了三万左右，意大利共产党增加了九万多。最近时期二十个国家的共产党胜利地举行的代表大会和代表会议显示了共产党队伍的团结一致、它们对马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的原则的忠诚，而莫斯科会议则令人信服地证明了共产主义运动的国际团结。
    我们的敌人一年以前还在叫嚣“共产主义危机”，而现在也不得不承认共产主义运动的力量和团结了。1956年11月27日美国的“约纽时报”尾随杜勒斯先生之后断言说：“目前共产主义世界正经受着其全部历史中最严重的危机，这种结论是难以避免的”。经过了一年，同是这家“纽约时报”的论调却变了。它写道：“从宣言中可以看到，苏联的威信和共产主义的团结都取得重大的成就。……”资产阶级的宣传机构就这样不得不承认“共产主义危机”的论调又一次破产。
    共产主义运动在自己的发展过程中不可避免地会遇到种种困难。它的历史上有过急遽的高涨和成就，也有过暂时的低潮。但是共产主义运动的低潮是暂时性的，而它的增长和巩固才是历史发展的客观规律。
    共产党揭露和公开批评自己的弱点、错误和缺点，以便使自己的队伍在思想上和组织上达到进一步巩固。
    在目前情况下，共产党的重要任务是进行反修正主义斗争——反对工人运动和共产主义运动中的机会主义流派的斗争。修正主义是共产主义运动的严重危险，它意味着在思想上向资本主义投降。修正主义者在许多重要问题上同资本主义思想家一致，帮助了他们进行反对马克思列宁主义的斗争。
    抹煞或者低估帝国主义的侵略实质、低估美国侵略集团及其帮凶筹划的新战争的危险，是当代修正主义的典型。最露骨的修正主义者的特点是，粉饰现代资本主义的丑恶，不批评资本主义，否认阶级斗争的基本规律，鼓吹阶级合作，否定工人阶级可以运用议会和工会活动以外的其他斗争方式来争取政权和社会主义的胜利。修正主义者把一些共产党同另外一些共产党对立起来，他们实际上放弃了无产阶级国际主义原则，而滚到“民族共产主义”的立场上去了。
    马克思列宁主义关于新型政党的学说是马克思列宁主义基本原理之一。马克思列宁主义教导我们，只有新型政党才能领导工人阶级和人民群众，才能向他们灌输社会主义意识，组织他们，并引导他们取得胜利。而事实也证明了这一点。
    现在大家都承认苏联的巨大成就。正是由于共产党的正确的马克思列宁主义政策，苏联人民克服了国内外反动派在他们道路上设下的重重困难，终于获得了社会主义的胜利。苏联人民的力量、中国人民以及社会主义各国人民的力量，就在于他们团结在本国共产党的周围，在于共产党领导他们的斗争。
    现在资产阶级也知道得很清楚，工人阶级的力量就在于这个阶级所建立的共产党。因此，资产阶级思想家以主要力量打击共产党。修正主义者主张放弃列宁的民主集中制原则，主张把共产党从一个战斗的革命组织变为清谈俱乐部之类的组织，这是对资产阶级有利的。
    列宁教导说，新型的政党应当用先进的革命理论武装起来，应当吸收工人阶级和其他劳动人民中的优秀儿女参加自己的队伍，应当成为密切联系群众和能够在人民各阶层中工作、当群众的先锋、教育群众、组织群众和领导群众斗争的党。
    各国兄弟共产党和工人党一方面反击着修正主义观点，同时采取措施在思想上和组织上加强自己的队伍。在这些措施中，加强党的工人成份的骨干、更大胆地把工人提拔到领导岗位、扩大生产小组网、改进对共产党员的思想教育、提高共产党报纸的思想水平、为彻底克服修正主义和宗派主义的倾向而斗争、以及制定切实可行的联系群众的方式，具有最重大的意义。
    各国共产党都在讨论会议的成果。德国统一社会党、保加利亚共产党、匈牙利社会主义工人党、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、朝鲜劳动党、蒙古人民革命党的中央委员会最近举行的全体会议一致赞同这两个宣言，确定了实现它们的措施。法国、意大利、英国、奥地利、日本和其他一些国家的共产党领导机构宣布完全支持莫斯科会议的决议。这些决议鼓舞着它们的争取和平、民主和社会主义的活动。
    （四）
    各国共产党和工人党面临着伟大的历史任务。为了完成这些任务，不但需要共产党和工人党本身的团结，而且需要整个工人阶级的团结，需要巩固工农联盟，需要全体劳动人民和进步人类的团结，需要全世界爱好自由和和平的力量的团结。
    现在，当世界社会主义体系已经成为强大的力量、社会主义思想已经掌握了千百万人的理智的时候，正确解释向社会主义过渡的方式具有重要的意义。
    在当前情况下，社会主义的胜利有了更有利的条件。工人阶级及其先锋队——马克思列宁主义的党力图通过和平的方式实现社会主义革命。这样做是符合工人阶级和全体人民的利益以及全民族的利益的。在一些资本主义国家里，工人阶级同它的先进部队有可能在工人阵线和人民阵线的基础上，在各政党和社会团体取得协议和实行政治合作的其他形式的基础上，把大多数的人民团结起来，不经过内战而取得国家政权，从而保证使基本生产资料转入人民手中。但是，只有广泛地不断地开展工农群众和城市中等阶层反对大垄断资本、反对反动派、争取深刻的社会改革、争取和平和社会主义的阶级斗争，才能实现这一切。
    同时，宣言着重指出，在剥削阶级对人民使用暴力的条件下，就必须考虑另外一种可能，即非和平地过渡到社会主义。向社会主义过渡的和平方法和非和平方法之间并没有不可逾越的鸿沟，在各种不同的历史条件下，一个国家内可以有这一种可能，也可以有那一种可能——必须灵活地决定自己的策略，必须考虑一个国家内以及国际规模上的力量对比。但是，随着社会主义力量的进一步加强，和平过渡到社会主义的可能性一定会不断地增长，这是毫无疑问的。
    阐明向社会主义过渡的方法问题具有重大的理论意义和政治意义。它再次提醒共产党人和工人阶级：必须掌握一切斗争方式——和平的和非和平的、议会的和议会外的，以便能够随时按照具体的历史条件，采用其中最适用的方法。
    各国共产党和工人党代表会议通过的代表会议宣言和和平宣言也向各社会党呼吁，两项宣言阐明了现代工人运动两个基本派别合作的纲领。
    共产党人在自己历史上最有代表性的会议中以社会主义国家共产党的名义，以整个国际共产主义运动的名义，向自己的阶级弟兄——社会党人——伸出手来，重新呼吁他们进行合作。这给合作的呼吁增添了特别的力量和意义。如果拒绝同共产党实行合作，那就会被所有正直的人认为是拒绝为拯救人类免除核战争的威胁的斗争，拒绝保护工人阶级和全体劳动人民的最迫切的要求。所以必须认为，莫斯科会议的文件一定会被大多数社会党党员所理解，一定会加强现在在社会民主党队伍中产生的那种要求同共产党人采取一致行动以保护工人阶级利益和各国人民之间的和平的趋向。
    共产党人主张与社会党人建立合作，为争取改善劳动人民的生活条件、扩大和卫护他们的民主权利、争取和保卫民族独立、争取世界和平和社会进步而奋斗。议会选举结果证明，在很多国家里，投票选举共产党人和社会党人的选民在40％以上。在法国、意大利、拉丁美洲各国，正在加强工人阶级团结的旗帜下展开声势浩大的罢工战斗。社会党和共产党的拥护者的共同努力将有助于建立一个强大的反对垄断资本的联合阵线，有助于在许多国家中大大改变议会里力量的对比，有助于建立左翼政府，从而促进争取社会主义的斗争。　　共产党和工人党莫斯科代表会议确定了工人运动和共产主义运动现阶段所面临的具有历史意义的问题。
    在当前的阶级斗争中，建设新型政党的列宁主义原则的生气勃勃的力量又一次获得了证实。用马克思列宁主义科学思想武装起来的、以民主集中制原则为基础的、同劳动群众具有广泛密切联系的工人阶级革命政党，是现代的进步运动、当前的一切解放斗争和反帝国主义斗争的灵魂和头脑。共产党的在思想上和组织上的加强是争取和平和社会主义斗争中获得新胜利的保证。
