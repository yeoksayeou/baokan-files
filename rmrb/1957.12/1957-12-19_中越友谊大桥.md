　　Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Bridge
　　A Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Bridge is being built on the Beilun River, which spans the border between China and Vietnam. This bridge will connect Dongxing Town on the southwestern border of Guangdong Province in our country with Mang Cai in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The bridge construction is scheduled to be completed in May next year. Upon completion, it will help promote the fraternal friendship between China and Vietnam and the economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries.
　　This bridge is being jointly built by the governments of China and Vietnam. The bridge is 124.8 meters long and about 11 meters high. It will be built entirely of reinforced concrete, so that even the largest local floods will not submerge the bridge.

　　中越友谊大桥
    在横跨中越两国边境的北仑河上，正在建筑一座中越友谊大桥。这座桥将把我国广东省西南边疆的东兴镇和越南民主共和国的芒街连接起来。建桥工程将在明年5月间竣工。建成后，它对促进中越两国兄弟般的友好关系和两国的经济、文化合作都将有所帮助。
    这座桥是中越两国政府共同建筑的。桥全长一百二十四点八公尺，高约十一公尺，将全部用钢筋混凝土建成，那时当地最大的洪水也淹不着桥身。
