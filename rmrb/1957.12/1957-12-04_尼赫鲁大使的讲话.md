Prime Minister, friends:
    Two days ago, a fine son of India, Dr. Edward, passed away here. We gather here to pay our respects to him.
    Today is a sad day for both India and China. But it is also a day of pride for both our countries, because Dr. Edward's spirit of sacrifice and his death in China set a great example worthy of emulation for all future generations. This is an example that further promotes the traditional friendship and cooperation between India and China. The importance of this friendship is even more significant today, and Dr. Edward played an important role in this cause.
    Dr. Edward was not only a glorious son of India, but also a true friend of China. Throughout his life, he sympathized with oppressed people, and therefore he went to Spain before coming to China to participate in the anti-fascist struggle. It has been almost twenty years since he first came to China with other members of the Indian medical team.
    The medical team that came to China at that time had a historical significance, because at that time, both our countries were struggling with hardships and difficulties. India was still fighting for freedom, and China was engaged in the War of Liberation. Obviously, under such circumstances, we sympathized with each other and helped each other as much as possible. The whole of India expressed sympathy for China. Although India had not yet gained freedom at that time and was not strong, we still wanted to express our friendship and sympathy in possible ways.
    Dr. Edward and his colleagues came to China with this goal, to do their best to help the Chinese people.
    Dr. Kotnis gave his life, and Dr. Edward was more fortunate. He saw the birth of New China and had the opportunity to witness the victory of the revolution that made the Chinese people stand up.
    Dr. Edward loved New China, and he was eager to further promote the friendship that already existed between India and China. Therefore, he came to China despite his illness. Although he failed to complete this task, he never forgot the friendship between India and China until his death. If we want to commemorate Dr. Edward, we should strengthen the friendship between India and China with the same love and enthusiasm, which is not only necessary for our two countries, but also beneficial for Asia and the world.
    I believe that we must emulate Dr. Edward's love for China and the same determination and strength he showed in sacrificing for China, to carry out mutual assistance and cooperation.
    This time, it was his misfortune that he fell ill from the first day he came to China and was never able to recover until the end. But it can also be said to be a blessing to die in a country that he loved so much and longed to serve.
    Dr. Edward's Chinese brothers and sisters made every possible effort to save his life. On behalf of the Indian people, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all the Chinese brothers and sisters, especially to Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, who personally showed great concern for Dr. Edward's condition.
    I would also like to thank the Sino-Indian Friendship Association for holding this memorial service, giving us the opportunity to pay our respects to Dr. Edward.
    Dr. Edward and all the Indian people sincerely wish that the friendship and cooperation between our two countries will be strengthened day by day. On this sad and proud day, let us all shout:
    Eternal glory to Dr. Edward, the glorious son of India and the true friend of China!
    Long live Sino-Indian friendship!

### 尼赫鲁大使的讲话

专栏：

　　尼赫鲁大使的讲话总理阁下，朋友们：
    两天前，印度的好儿子爱德华医生在这里逝世了。我们在这里举行追悼以对他表示敬意。
    今天对于印度和中国都是一个悲哀的日子。但是这也是我们两国引以为骄傲的一天，因为爱德华医生的牺牲精神以及他最后在中国逝世，为我们未来的一切时代树立了一个值得模仿的伟大榜样。这是一个进一步促进印中两国的传统友谊和合作的榜样。这个友谊的重要性在今天已来得更为显著，而爱德华医生在这个事业中也起了一个重要作用。
    爱德华医生不仅是印度的光荣的儿子，同时也是中国的一个真实朋友。他一生同情了被压迫人民，因此他来中国以前曾到西班牙去参加反法西斯的斗争。自从他第一次和印度医疗队的其他人员到中国来访问，到现在已将近二十年了。
    当时前来中国的这个医疗队具有一个历史性的意义，因为在那个时候，我们两个国家都在和艰苦困难进行斗争。印度在当时仍在争取自由，而中国在从事于解放战争。显然，在这种处境下，我们彼此同情并尽可能互相给与帮助。整个印度都对中国表示同情。虽然印度在当时还没获得自由，力量不大，可是我们仍想用可能的方式，来表示我们的友谊和同情。
    爱德华医生和他的同事们本着这个目标来到了中国，以尽其能力来帮助中国人民。
    柯棣华医生献出了他的生命，爱德华医生要幸运一些，他看到了新中国的诞生，并且有机会看到使中国人民站立起来的革命的胜利。
    爱德华医生热爱新中国，他渴望进一步促进业已存在于印度和中国间的友谊，因此抱病来到中国。他虽然未能完成这一任务，可是他直到临终前仍念念不忘印中的友谊。如果我们要纪念爱德华医生的话，我们就应当用同样的友爱和热情来加强印中两国的友谊，这对于我们两国来讲不仅是必要的，而且对于亚洲和全世界也是有好处的。
    我相信，我们必须仿效爱德华医生热爱中国和不惜为中国牺牲所表示的同样决心和力量来进行互助和合作。
    这一次，自从他到中国来的第一天就病倒了，直到最后都未能摆脱，这是他的不幸。但是能死在一个他极为热爱并且渴望为它服务的国家内，也可以说是一件幸事。
    爱德华医生的中国兄弟姐妹们为了挽救他的生命，尽了一切可能的努力。我谨代表印度人民对所有的中国兄弟姐妹们表示衷心的感谢，特别是周恩来总理阁下，他亲自对爱德华医生的病情表示了极大的关怀。
    我还要感谢中印友好协会举行这个追悼会，使我们有机会向爱德华医生表示敬意。
    爱德华医生和所有印度人民都恳切愿望我们两国间的友好和合作将日益加强。在这个悲痛同时骄傲的日子，让我们一齐高呼：
    印度的光荣儿子、中国的真实朋友爱德华医生永垂不朽！
    印中友好万岁！
