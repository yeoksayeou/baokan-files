    Chairman, fellow workers, greetings to you all. Please allow me, in the name of the Secretary-General of the Thai Free Workers Association, to bring the message of peace and friendship from Thai workers to Chinese workers and all the Chinese people. I am very honored to have this opportunity to participate in the Chinese Trade Union Congress.
    This is my first time visiting China. For a long time, I have dreamed of visiting my Chinese comrades, but I could never find the opportunity. This trip to China only came about because a suitable opportunity presented itself, allowing me to participate in the Congress. However, due to some obstacles, I arrived a bit late. Nevertheless, I was able to convey my message of peace and friendship to the Congress in advance, on the first day of its opening. The blood ties between the Chinese and Thai peoples are very close, almost inseparable. The Chinese people living in Thailand were very happy when they learned that I was coming to China. The relationship between the Chinese and Thai peoples has a history of thousands of years, but in a later period, due to political storms, this relationship became estranged. Besides, there is not much difference between the lifestyles of the Chinese and Thai peoples. In Thailand, there is a song that has been popular for decades, which begins: "The Chinese and Thai peoples are not distant neighbors, but close brothers." This song is sung by Thais, overseas Chinese, and even children. I believe that the relationship between the Chinese and Thai peoples will become even closer in the future. The sky has begun to show the light of dawn, and it will become brighter day by day. I have personally seen the great development of the Chinese labor movement and believe that the Chinese labor movement will continue to develop and become a pioneer and protector of world peace.
    Imperialism is becoming increasingly extinct. Today's situation of imperialism is like a patient who is about to die, struggling desperately to survive, but experienced doctors will determine that such a patient cannot be saved and has only one way to go: death. In order for world peace to last as long as heaven and earth, the workers of the world must unite.
    Since China was liberated, it has had to vigorously recover because there were war scars everywhere. The Chinese people and the Chinese workers have been working together to build the country, and everyone is working selflessly to make their country progress and prosper, so that it can keep pace with other countries. Please allow me, on behalf of the Thai workers, to express my excitement at your march towards final victory. Everywhere I go in China, I feel like I am in my own home, which shows that we have a close relationship of thousands of years. I want to thank the Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Trade Union for the warm and friendly reception he gave me. Finally, please allow me once again, in the name of the Thai workers, to congratulate the Chinese people on achieving new victories, and to congratulate the Chinese trade union on its increasing development.
    Please allow me to present three books to the Congress on behalf of the Thai Free Workers Association as a souvenir, two of which are works by the Chairman of the Thai Free Workers Association, and the other is the "Thai Trade Union Law" published by the Thai Free Workers Association, with Chinese and Thai translations.
    Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Thai peoples!
    Long live peace!

    泰国自由工人协会总书记
    乃巴博·素空致词
    主席、职工同志们，你们好。请允许我以泰国自由工人协会总书记的名义，把泰国工人的和平友谊愿望带给中国职工和全体中国人民。我这次有机会参加中国工会的大会，感到非常荣幸。
    我到中国来还是第一次。长时期以来，我就梦想能拜访中国的同志们，但是总找不到机会。这次来中国也是碰到了适当的机会，所以才能来参加大会。但是由于某种阻碍，我来得迟了些。虽然如此，我总算能在大会开幕的第一天，预先向大会致以和平友谊之意。中泰两民族血统很接近，几乎无法分开。居住在泰国的中国人，知道我要到中国来的时候，都很高兴。中泰两民族的关系已有上千年的历史，但在以后一个时期由于政治上的风暴，这种关系疏远了。此外，中泰两民族的生活习惯也没有什么差别。在泰国，几十年来流行着一首歌，它开头是：“中泰两族并非远邻，而是亲兄弟。”这首歌无论是泰国人，华侨或者是小孩子都会唱。我相信中泰两民族的关系今后将会更加密切。天空已开始露出曙光，它将一天比一天更加明亮。我这次亲眼看到中国的职工运动有了很大的开展，相信今后中国的工运会不断向前发展，并成为先导者、世界和平的保卫者。
    帝国主义已日趋灭亡。今天帝国主义的状况，正如一个将要断气的病人一样，在拚命挣扎求生，但是有经验的医生会断定，这样的病人是无法挽救的，他只有死路一条。为使世界和平能与天地长存，全世界的劳动者必须团结起来。
    中国解放后由于到处都有战争的伤痕，所以必须大力恢复。中国人民和中国的劳动者，已经同心协力在建设国家，每个人都在忘我地劳动，使自己的国家进步繁荣，能与各国并驾齐驱。请允许我代表泰国的职工对你们正在走向最终的胜利表示兴奋。我来到中国的每个地方，都感到好像是在自己的家中一样，这说明了我们是有上千年的密切关系。我要感谢广州市工会主席所给予我的热情友好招待。最后，请再允许我以泰国工人的名义，祝贺中国人民能取得新的胜利，祝贺中国工会日益发展。
    请允许我在此代表泰国自由工人协会向大会送三本书作为纪念，其中两本为泰国自由工人协会主席的作品，另外一本是泰国自由工人协会所刊印、有中泰文对照的“泰国工会法”。
    中泰两国人民的友谊万岁！
    和平万岁！
