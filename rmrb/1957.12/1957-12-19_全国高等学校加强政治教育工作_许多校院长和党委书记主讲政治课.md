    National Higher Education Institutions Strengthen Political Education
    Many Presidents and Party Secretaries Lecture on Politics

    (Our Newspaper dispatch) After the anti-Rightist struggle, Party committees in higher education institutions across the country have comprehensively strengthened their leadership over ideological and political education. All major issues related to the newly established political course this academic year—the Socialism Education course—including the curriculum content, planning steps, teaching methods, and the allocation of teaching resources, have been arranged and deployed by the Party committees on the basis of full discussion and research. The Party committees also study and resolve any problems that arise during the course of Socialism Education. Teachers responsible for the Socialism Education course and related work cadres are all uniformly allocated by the Party committees and work under the direct leadership of Party organizations at all levels.

    In addition to strengthening the leadership of political education in principle and organization, the Party committees have also strengthened their specific operational leadership of political education. Many school Party secretaries and presidents directly lead the work of the political education teaching and research sections and personally lecture on politics. The opening mobilization reports for the first lesson of the Socialism Education course were mostly given by school presidents or Party secretaries. For example, Hu Xikui, Vice President of the People’s University of China, Jiang Nanxiang, President of Tsinghua University, He Xilin, Vice President of Beijing Normal University, Li Shusen, Vice President of Tianjin University, and Guo Yingqiu, President of Nanjing University, all personally delivered mobilization reports.

    During the Socialism Education course, many school leaders also undertook special lectures. For example, the People’s University of China decided that the struggle between the two lines in higher education would be lectured on by Nie Zhen, Vice President and Deputy Party Secretary, and Zou Lufeng. The two topics of cadre policy and cadre treatment, and vigilance against the erosion of bourgeois ideology, would be lectured on by Cui Yaoxian, Deputy Party Secretary. Liu Piyun, Vice President of Nankai University, serves concurrently as the Director of the Socialism Education Teaching and Research Group, and is responsible for giving special reports and answering questions.

    Some school leaders are also preparing to permanently concurrently lecture on Marxist-Leninist theory courses in the future. For example, Li Da, President of Wuhan University, has already undertaken the teaching work of the Marxist-Leninist philosophy course—Dialectical Materialism. Hu Xinren, Deputy Party Secretary of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and Deng Xuchu, a member of the Party Committee, along with nineteen other Party members, all serve as teachers for political classes, Party classes, and current affairs and policy classes.

    These measures taken by higher education institutions in various regions will play a role in thoroughly strengthening the Party's leadership over Marxist-Leninist education, improving theoretical education, overcoming the shortcomings of dogmatism, opposing revisionist tendencies, improving teaching quality, and cultivating intellectuals of the working class, all of which are of great significance.

    Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch: Since the beginning of this semester, the Party committees of nine higher education institutions in Nanjing have directly led the teaching of political courses. Nanjing University, East China Institute of Water Conservancy, Nanjing Normal College, Nanjing Aeronautical College, and other institutions have had their Deputy Party Secretaries concurrently serve as or transferred to be the Directors of the Marxist-Leninist Teaching and Research Sections.

    Party secretaries, deputy secretaries, and Party member presidents of various institutions all participate in lecturing on political courses. The Party secretary and deputy secretary of the East China Institute of Water Conservancy have given nine reports and summaries of each stage of study. Guo Yingqiu, President and Party Secretary of Nanjing University, participates in discussions in addition to giving lectures and reports. After the Party secretary and Party member president of Nanjing Institute of Technology participated in teaching, the Party Committee organized 125 political teachers and teachers with a certain political level to go deep into various departments and classes to provide political tutoring and lead student discussions and informal talks.

    The Party secretaries' lectures on political courses are closely integrated with the current political movement center of each stage and the students' ideological situation. Under the centralized leadership of the Party Committee, teaching materials are compiled independently. In the study of the introduction part of Socialism Education, second-year students at the East China Institute of Water Conservancy raised more than sixty questions, and many confused views were clarified through discussion. More than 270 fourth-year students also conducted self-ideological examinations in the study and discussion of political courses, combined with the political situation within the school in the previous period. Nanjing Institute of Technology conducted discipline education through political courses. In the discussions, students exposed several bad elements who disrupted school order and criticized some bad phenomena such as not cherishing public property, waste, and disrespect for teachers. Most classes also formulated class covenants according to the specific situation, and the internal order of the school has been greatly improved.

    Currently, the political courses in various schools are also conducting education on issues such as labor viewpoints, academic style, and streamlining institutions. Students are learning while posting big-character posters to assist the school in rectification.

    全国高等学校加强政治教育工作
    许多校院长和党委书记主讲政治课
    本报讯　全国高等学校党委在反右派斗争后，全面地加强了对思想政治教育工作的领导。本学年新开设的政治课——社会主义教育课程方面一切重大的问题，包括课程内容，计划步骤，教学方式，教学力量的配备等，都是党委在充分讨论和研究的基础上，安排和部署的。对于社会主义教育课程进行过程中出现的问题，党委都随时进行研究和解决。担任社会主义教育课程的教员和有关工作干部，都由党委统一调配，并在各级党组织的直接领导下进行工作。
    党委除了加强对政治教育原则上组织上的领导外，还加强了对政治教育具体的业务上的领导。许多学校的党委书记和校院长都直接领导了政治课教研室的工作，并且亲自主讲政治课。社会主义教育课程的第一课动员报告，大都是由各校校院长或党委书记担任的，如中国人民大学胡锡奎副校长、清华大学蒋南翔校长、北京师范大学何锡麟副校长、天津大学李曙森副校长，南京大学郭影秋校长都亲自做了动员报告。
    在社会主义教育课程进行过程中，不少学校领导同志还担任了专题讲授的工作。例如，中国人民大学决定：关于高等教育中两条路线的斗争就由副校长兼党委副书记聂真和邹鲁风担任讲授，关于干部政策与干部待遇问题，警惕资产阶级思想的侵蚀两个专题由党委副书记崔耀先担任讲授。南开大学副校长刘披云兼任社会主义教育教研组主任，并担任专题报告与解答问题的工作。
    还有些学校领导同志已经准备今后将长期地兼任马克思列宁主义理论课的讲授工作，例如武汉大学校长李达已经担任了马克思列宁主义哲学—辩证唯物主义一课的教学工作。上海交通大学党委副书记胡辛人，党委委员邓旭初等十九名党员都担任了政治课、党课、时事政策课的教员。
    各地高等学校这些措施，将发挥彻底加强党对马列主义教育的领导作用，对于改进理论教育，克服教条主义的缺点，反对修正主义倾向，提高教学质量，培养工人阶级的知识分子，都具有重大的意义。
    本报特约新华社专稿　南京市九所高等院校党委本学期以来直接领导政治课的教学，南京大学、华东水利学院、南京师范学院、南京航空学院等院校并由党委副书记兼任或下放为马列主义教研室主任。
    各院校党委书记、副书记、党员院校长都参加讲授政治课，华东水利学院的党委书记和副书记已作过九次报告和每一阶段的学习小结。南京大学校长兼党委书记郭影秋除上课做报告外，还参加讨论。南京工学院在党委书记、党员院长参加授课后，党委会又组织了政治课教师和具有一定政治水平的教员一百二十五人深入各系科班级，担任政治课辅导，领导学生讨论漫谈。
    党委书记讲授政治课，密切结合当前每一阶段的政治运动中心和学生思想情况，在党委集中领导下自编教材。华东水利学院二年级学生在社会主义教育导言部分的学习中提出了六十多个问题，经过讨论许多糊涂看法得到澄清；四年级二百七十多个学生在政治课的学习和讨论中还结合前一时期校内政治情况进行了自我思想检查。南京工学院通过政治课进行纪律教育，学生们在讨论中揭发了几个破坏学校秩序的坏分子，对一些人不爱护公物、浪费、不尊重师长等不良现象进行批判，多数的班级还根据具体情况订出了班级公约，学校内部秩序大大改善。
    目前，各校政治课还以劳动观点、学风、紧缩机构等问题为内容进行教育，学生们边学习边贴大字报，协助学校进行整改。
