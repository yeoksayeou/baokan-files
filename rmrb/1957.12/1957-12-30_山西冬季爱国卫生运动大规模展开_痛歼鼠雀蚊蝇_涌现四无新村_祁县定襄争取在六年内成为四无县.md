    (Reported by this newspaper) A large-scale winter patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the "four pests" is rapidly unfolding across Shanxi Province, closely integrated with the high tide of major agricultural construction.

    From the beginning of December to the 21st, Jishan and Tunliu counties achieved a tremendous outcome, catching and exterminating 643,000 rats and sparrows. The number of newly emerged "four-without" villages increased from 72 to 104. Dongligao Township in Tunliu County used to be plagued by all "four pests," with rampant diseases and a startling mortality rate. In the years since liberation, due to the active implementation of the patriotic health campaign, the entire township has eliminated more than 249,000 sparrows and rats, and more than 6,800 jin of flies and maggots. The sanitary conditions have undergone a fundamental change, transforming from a "dirty township" and "plague-ridden township" into a model sanitation township, a township without the "four pests." Jishan County, led by Deputy County Head Jiao Jurong, personally led 120 people deep into five market towns, thirteen townships, and 185 natural villages. Combining production inspections, she conducted a comprehensive inspection and promotion of sanitation work, and selected four special-grade sanitation model villages, eighty-seven first-class sanitation model villages, and seventy-eight second-class model villages. In order to push the movement to a new high, County Head Huangfuliping recently delivered a mobilization report to all personnel of agencies and schools, calling for "re-energizing, redoubling efforts, and launching a sanitation campaign where everyone takes action to eliminate the four pests." A county-wide sanitation model award ceremony will also be held at the end of December. In addition, it is planned to gather all sanitation personnel in the county, combined with the rectification movement, to conduct a major debate on the question of whether launching the patriotic health campaign hinders production or promotes production, in order to further unify thinking, clarify understanding, and lay a good foundation for the widespread and in-depth development of the mass patriotic health campaign in the future.

    All parts of the province have also put forward the slogan of "Learning from Taiyang Village" and "Emulating Taiyang Village" (Editor's note: Taiyang Village is a sanitation model village in Jishan County, Shanxi Province. For details, see the communication on page 7 of this newspaper on December 2: "Our Peasants Live a Civilized Life."). Nineteen townships in ten counties, including Daren and Hequ, have pledged to basically eliminate the four pests, the fastest in two years and the slowest in five years. Qi County and Dingxiang County are striving to become "four-without" counties within six years. Qi County's specific plan is: Pushang Village, the current sanitation model village, will catch up with Taiyang Village within one year; the whole county will conduct a one-year pilot, four-year intensive effort, and one-year cleanup, striving to eliminate the four pests within six years. After visiting Taiyang Village, Hongduan Township in Hongzhao County immediately made a plan. After mobilization, the Xingxing and Xingliang agricultural cooperatives, with 769 male and female laborers, spent only three days repairing toilets, digging up thatch, and accumulating 1.2 million jin of fertilizer; repairing 23 streets, and accumulating 2.22 million jin of fertilizer, which can fertilize 669 mu of farmland. After visiting Taiyang Village, Jiaocheng and Fenyang counties also immediately began to cultivate key points in order to establish a banner and promote it throughout the county.

    Party and government leaders in various places attach great importance to sanitation work, and have held meetings at all levels to mobilize and deploy. The Yuci Special District recently held a sanitation administration conference for the entire district. The Jinan Special District organized an inspection team of more than 40 people to go deep into ten counties, including Linyi, to supervise and guide. The Xin County Special District also held a conference of sanitation section chiefs and epidemic prevention station chiefs from 17 counties in the entire district in Dingxiang and Hequ, where sanitation work was relatively well done, to deploy winter sanitation work. Tunliu County also held a county-wide mobilization meeting for the winter patriotic health campaign in Dongligao Village, a sanitation model village. In addition, it is also planning to hold a sanitation model conference in the near future. Thirty-four cities and counties, including Datong and Ningwu, have also issued notices or instructions to launch the winter and spring sanitation campaign.

    山西冬季爱国卫生运动大规模展开
    痛歼鼠雀蚊蝇　涌现四无新村
    祁县定襄争取在六年内成为四无县
    本报讯　以除四害为中心的、规模宏大的冬季爱国卫生运动，正紧密结合着农业大建设高潮在山西全省各地迅速展开。
    稷山、屯留两县从12月初到21日止，已获得捕鼠、灭雀六十四万三千只的巨大成果，新出现的四无村，由过去的七十二个增至一百零四个。屯留县东李高乡过去“四害”俱全，疾病流行，死亡率惊人。解放几年来，由于积极开展了爱国卫生运动，全乡共消灭麻雀、老鼠二十四万九千多只，苍蝇和蛆六千八百多斤，卫生状况发生了根本变化。由“肮脏乡”、“病魔乡”变成卫生模范乡、没有“四害”乡。稷山县由蕉菊荣副县长亲自出马，带领一百二十人深入到五个集镇、十三个乡、一百八十五个自然村，结合检查生产对卫生工作进行了全面检查与推动，并评出了特等卫生模范村四个、甲等卫生模范村八十七个、乙等模范村七十八个。为了把运动推向新的高潮，县长皇甫里平最近还对各机关、学校的全体人员，做了“重整旗鼓、再接再厉、开展一个人人动手灭四害的卫生运动”的动员报告。12月底，还将召开全县的卫生模范评奖大会。另外，并计划集中全县卫生人员结合整风运动，就展开爱国卫生运动是妨碍生产、还是增进生产等问题，进行一次大辩论，以便进一步统一思想，明确认识，为今后普遍深入地开展群众性爱国卫生运动打下良好基础。
    全省各地也纷纷提出了“学习太阳村”、“向太阳村看齐”（编者按：太阳村是山西稷山县的一个卫生模范村。详情见12月2日本报七版通讯：“我们的农民过着文明的生活。”）的行动口号。大仁、河曲等十县的十九个乡提出保证：最快的在二年、最慢的在五年内要把四害基本消灭光。祁县、定襄两县争取在六年内成为“四无”县。祁县的具体规划是：现在的卫生模范村蒲桑村，要在一年之内赶上太阳村；全县是一年试点、四年抓、一年扫尾，争取六年内消灭四害。洪赵县红段乡参观了太阳村后，也立即做出了规划，经过发动，仅星星、星亮两农业社七百六十九个男女劳力，三天时间整修厕所就挖茅土积肥一百二十万斤；整修街道二十三条，积肥二百二十二万斤，共可肥田六百六十九亩。交城、汾阳等县在参观了太阳村后，也立即着手培养重点，以树立旗帜，全县推广。
    各地党政领导对卫生工作十分重视，并层层召开会议，进行动员布置。榆次专区最近召开了全区的卫生行政会议；晋南专区组织了四十余人的检查队，深入临猗等十个县进行督促指导；忻县专区也分别在卫生工作搞得较好的定襄、河曲两地，召开了全区十七个县的卫生科长和防疫站长会议，布置冬季卫生工作。屯留县亦在卫生模范村东李高村召开了全县的开展冬季爱国卫生运动动员大会，另外，还准备在最近召开卫生模范大会。大同、宁武等三十四个市、县，亦发出开展今冬明春卫生运动的通知或指示。
