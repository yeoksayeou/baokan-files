Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 21st (TASS): The full text of Khrushchev's speech at the Supreme Soviet session on December 21st is as follows:

Comrade Deputies!

Allow me to express my views on some issues concerning the current international situation. I fully agree with the Foreign Minister Gromyko's reply to the inquiries of the Supreme Soviet deputies.

If we talk about the most important events in the international arena recently, we should first talk about the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist revolution and the meetings of the representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties held in Moscow.

The 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution became an international demonstration of the victory of peace and socialist ideology, the achievements of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all socialist countries, and their peaceful foreign policy.

**The Moscow Meetings Marked the Victory of the World Communist Movement**

During the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries, as well as representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties from sixty-four countries, held meetings in Moscow. At these meetings, two historic documents were adopted—the Declaration of the Representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and the Peace Manifesto.

As the Resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU on the results of the meetings of the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties pointed out, these meetings convincingly demonstrated the further unity of the socialist camp and of the entire international communist movement on the basis of Marxist-Leninist ideology. To formulate and proclaim the most important tasks of the Communists in the current stage of world history in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism, to unite the entire international communist movement, and to further strengthen the ties between the fraternal parties—these are the basic results of the meetings. The historical significance of these meetings lies in the fact that they marked the greatest ideological and political victory of the world communist movement and the workers' movement, and the victory of the principles of proletarian internationalism. The results of these meetings, which were conducted in a comrade-like and sincere atmosphere, were a fatal blow to the plans of the reactionary forces of imperialism, which have recently spent much effort trying to split the international communist movement.

The fact that millions of communists and the broadest masses of working people in all countries warmly endorse the documents adopted at the two meetings—the two declarations—means that the hopes of the imperialists and their lackeys for a "crisis" in the world communist movement have been dashed.

The Declaration of the Representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries is an example of creatively developing Marxism-Leninism on the basis of summarizing the collective experience of the communist parties of socialist and capitalist countries.

 The Peace Manifesto adopted by the conferences of Communist and Workers’ Parties of all countries has great historical significance in the struggle for world peace. As everyone knows, a delegation from the League of Communists of Yugoslavia participated in the conferences of brother parties of various countries and jointly adopted the Peace Manifesto. This fact is a new development in the further rapprochement between the Yugoslav Communists and our party as well as other Communist and Workers' parties. However, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia did not participate in the conference of brother parties of socialist countries and did not sign the Declaration. Is this a bad factor? Of course it is, because it proves that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia still has differences with all other Communist and Workers' parties of socialist countries on some ideological and political issues. However, it is clear that the current differences are smaller than before. On many important issues, the Yugoslav Communists act in concert with all Communist and Workers' parties. We will continue to implement a policy of friendship and cooperation with the fraternal people of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, and strive to strengthen relations with the League of Communists of Yugoslavia on the basis of unwavering Marxist-Leninist principles, and overcome the ideological and political differences that still exist.

In the documents adopted by the two meetings, there are many places that praise our working class and its fighting vanguard—the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—for being the first to successfully complete the socialist revolution and for achieving historic victories in the struggle for communism. (Stormy applause)

**The International Reactionaries' Attempt to Weaken the Solidarity of Socialist Countries Has Completely Failed**

It is no accident that the enemies of socialism have in the past and continue to focus their fire on all communist parties, especially the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Our working-class and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have set an example of revolutionary struggle against exploiters, for the interests of the working class, for the interests of working people, and for the victory of socialism. Therefore, enemies of all kinds always want to belittle the role of the Soviet Union in the revolutionary movement and try to undermine its prestige. However, their attempts have never succeeded, and they will not succeed in the future (applause). They always want to weaken the strength of the revolutionary communist and workers' parties and split the solidarity of socialist countries. They try to pit one socialist country against another and weaken the unity of revolutionary forces.

Imperialists attempt to use concern for the "independence" of certain countries as a cover to conceal their perfidious tactics aimed at undermining the unity of socialist countries. When imperialist groups are engaged in activities against the unity of socialist countries, they disguise themselves as defenders of the independence and sovereignty of certain countries. And when they talk about the need for capitalist countries to form military blocs, they demand that their partners cede their national sovereignty for the sake of this collusion, while insisting that absolute sovereignty does not exist and that it is lagging behind the times.

In the future, we must also be vigilant, not be fooled, and resolutely and consistently pursue a policy of promoting the unity and solidarity of countries in the socialist camp, pursue a peaceful policy based on Leninist principles of peaceful coexistence, and pursue a policy of strengthening cooperation and friendly relations between countries.

The results of the meeting of the representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties prove that the international reactionaries' plan to split and weaken the solidarity of socialist countries, undermine the prestige of the Soviet Union, and weaken the ties between the fraternal parties and our communist party has completely failed. The work of the meeting confirmed the deep sympathy of the fraternal parties for our party and the Soviet people. Even the most heinous enemies of the Soviet Union must now admit that the prestige of the Soviet Union among the working people of the world is unshakable, and that all fraternal parties have deep trust in our communist party. (Long and enthusiastic applause)

The best response of communists and all Soviet people to this trust is our selfless struggle to build a communist society, to further enhance the power of the Soviet state and the entire socialist camp, and to unremittingly struggle for peace among nations and to consolidate friendship with the working people and democratic forces around the world. (Stormy applause)

We thank all our friends for their trust and recognition of the achievements of our party and our people. We declare to all friends and comrades that today, in the struggle for the victory of communism, we are as vibrant and energetic as we were in the days of struggle for the victory of the October Revolution, and as we were fighting on the front lines of the Civil War and the Great Patriotic War. (Stormy applause)

We have maintained the great revolutionary zeal, and we assure our comrades who are fighting for the cause of the working class that we will always be loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism, and we will continue to regard ourselves as the advanced team that once held high the banner of Lenin, launched the first assault on capitalism under Lenin's leadership, and has now victoriously held up this banner for forty years. (Stormy applause)

We guarantee that we will firmly hold the banner of Lenin, confidently march towards the victory of communism, and resolutely struggle for world peace. (Stormy applause)

**Socialist Countries Persistently Implement a Policy of Peace**

Comrades! The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all socialist countries are steadfastly pursuing a policy of easing international tension, ending the "Cold War" and the arms race, and establishing lasting peace among all peoples on the basis of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. This policy is determined by the essence of the foreign policy of socialist countries. This policy has been supported by many countries in Europe, especially Asia and Africa. The movement for peace is becoming increasingly widespread among the people in capitalist countries.

It must be pointed out that a growing number of activists advocate ending the "Cold War" policy, stopping the arms race, and establishing mutual relations between countries based on peaceful coexistence.

We pay tribute to the outstanding state activists who resolutely fight for the cause of peace, such as Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Indonesian President Sukarno, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, Egyptian President Nasser, Syrian President Kuwatly, and other state activists. (Long and enthusiastic applause)

People from different social strata and different social positions—freelancers, entrepreneurs, politicians—have attacked the "Cold War" policy. Recently, various individuals, such as Canadian Foreign Minister Smith, British philosopher Russell, former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kennan, entrepreneur Eaton, journalist Hearst, and many other social figures and state activists in capitalist countries, have advocated that the balance of power on the international stage must be assessed more realistically.

Peace-loving people welcome such statements because they understand what war means in modern conditions.

However, the ruling groups of imperialist countries stubbornly pursue a line of intensifying relations between countries, further expanding and strengthening aggressive military blocs, and continuing to expand armaments. These groups disregard the interests of the people and are unwilling to abandon the aggressive policy in foreign affairs. These groups carry out the will of a small but influential group of monopoly capitalists who hope to intensify and maintain the "Cold War" state and expect it to turn into a "hot war." What do the interests of the people matter to them! They care little about the fate of mankind; they are only eager to get rich by profiting from the suffering and misfortune of ordinary people. Imperialists have their own motto—the worse things are for the cause of peace, the more profitable it is to get rich. A state of panic and anxiety, and people's fear of a possible atomic war, is precisely a favorable situation in which imperialists can most easily realize their plans and squeeze taxpayers' money to expand armaments.

The people are tired of war hysteria and nerve warfare, and they can hardly tolerate the heavy burden of taxes that weigh heavily on working people first and foremost. If people calculate the cost of the arms race in various countries, they will be shocked, and they will realize how much national wealth has been wasted in vain, and this wealth could have been used to improve people's living standards and develop the economy and culture under other conditions.

The question is: If things are to develop in the direction of peace and peaceful resolution of disputes, instead of leading to an atomic war fraught with disastrous consequences, imperialists must abandon the "Cold War" and the arms race policy, and abandon the hope of changing the world by force to suit the wishes of monopoly groups. It should be understood that the purpose of the imperialist "position of strength" policy is to force the Soviet Union to accept the Western countries' ultimatum-style demands, and "resolve" certain political issues on terms favorable to the imperialists.

For example, Western countries want to "solve" the issue of people's democratic countries. But what does their "solution" refer to? They want to eliminate the socialist achievements of working people by interfering in the internal affairs of these countries, regardless of the will of the people, and let the rule of capitalists and landlords be restored. Imperialists also often talk about "solving" the German question. How do they understand this "solution"? They hope to "unify" Germany by merging East Germany into West Germany, that is, by eliminating the socialist achievements of the German Democratic Republic and strengthening the military and economic power of West Germany, and then dragging Germany, unified in this way, into the aggressive North Atlantic bloc. Look, they want us to automatically strengthen German militarism and revanchism.

This way of "solving" political issues is tantamount to a policy of bullying and ultimatums. This policy has never succeeded against the Soviet Union in the past, and it will not succeed now (long and enthusiastic applause).

**East and West Should Resolve Disputes Through Peaceful Negotiations and Not Interfere in Each Other's Internal Affairs**

We warn the representatives of Western countries, especially the representatives of the United States, please throw your stupid and discredited "position of strength" policy into the dustbin of history. That is where it belongs! (Long and enthusiastic applause).

Let us resolve disputes through peaceful negotiations, discuss issues of pressing concern to mankind calmly, without arrogance, and on the basis of equality, let us not use war as a means of resolving international issues, recognize the status quo, that is, recognize the situation that has already formed in the world, that is, the existence of socialist countries and capitalist countries, and do not interfere in each other's internal affairs.

We believe that no matter how sharp the ideological differences between the two systems—socialism and capitalism—we must resolve international disputes through peaceful negotiations, not through war. We propose replacing the race to invent new weapons with peaceful competition. The victory of a social system does not depend on rockets, nor does it depend on atomic and hydrogen bombs, but on which system can better guarantee the material and spiritual well-being of the people.

We believe that the socialist system is the highest form of social organization. Let this or that social system not prove its superiority in war, but in peaceful settings, in the development of social productive forces, science, technology, culture, and in creating better conditions for human life (long and enthusiastic applause).

Tell me, what is there here that cannot be accepted by all countries, regardless of which system governs them? But the most aggressive imperialist groups in the West do not want to abolish the "Cold War" and are looking for various excuses to continue it. Imperialist groups are trying to scare the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, hoping that this will force the Soviet Union to spend more funds on the military industry, making it impossible for it to develop the production of consumer goods for the people.

**Imperialism is Afraid of Peaceful Competition with the Socialist System**

That is the actual situation. Imperialists are more afraid of peaceful competition with the socialist system than they are of fire.

The Soviet Union and other socialist countries have not threatened anyone with war, and they do not intend to force anyone to accept their ideas and ways of doing things by force. The only thing they offer is peace and friendship among all peoples (applause). We hope to achieve mutual understanding, establish trust between countries, end the incitement of war frenzy, and bring peace, so that people can work peacefully.

It seems clear enough. But some people tell us that this is propaganda! Yes, it is propaganda, but not propaganda for war, but propaganda for peace. Because the Soviet Union, unlike the United States, for example, believes that propaganda for war is the most serious crime and is subject to legal sanctions. But what is wrong with propaganda for peace! We are willing to hear this kind of propaganda from Western countries every day and every hour. But on the contrary, Western government officials and generals are issuing war cries and threatening statements every day: saying that the latest weapons of war can be used to "eliminate the Soviet Union" and to "wipe out" many cities and industrial centers in our country.

When they want to insult the Soviet Union's peace-loving steps with some kind of spell, they always use the word "propaganda." But the purpose of doing so is only to escape the essence of the issue with this trick. Because, apart from the belligerent and aggressive policies, the ruling groups in the Western countries have nothing to counter the peace-loving policies of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

Recently, the Soviet government's letters to the governments of the United States, Britain, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Turkey, Norway, Denmark, and other member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as well as to the governments of all member states of the United Nations, have become the focus of world opinion. The Soviet Union's new peace initiatives have been embraced and supported by all those who cherish the cause of peace and security for all peoples.

As everyone knows, the Soviet government has expressed its willingness to stop all nuclear weapon explosions from January 1, 1958, if the United States and Britain do the same.

The Soviet Union has proposed that the United States and Britain, which possess atomic and hydrogen weapons, should not use such weapons. The Soviet Union has proposed disbanding all military blocs and establishing a collective security system in Europe and Asia, or at least concluding a non-aggression treaty between the participating countries of the North Atlantic Alliance and the participating countries of the Warsaw Treaty. We believe that there are completely realistic conditions for establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe.

We propose reaching an agreement on the normalization of the situation in the Middle East; concluding a Soviet-American friendship treaty; taking measures to stop war propaganda; and expanding trade, scientific, cultural, and sports ties. We propose abandoning discrimination and restrictions, and establishing international relations on the basis of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in each other's internal affairs for political, economic, and ideological reasons, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.

These are our proposals. The Soviet government put forward these proposals with a sincere desire to maintain and consolidate peace. Our peaceful policy is by no means a sign of weakness. It is appropriate to recall here what representatives of Western countries were saying years ago, insisting that the Soviet Union's peaceful policy and its proposals on the need to ease international tensions were a sign of our economic weakness and technological backwardness. Therefore, they said, it was necessary to put pressure on the Soviet Union and threaten it with force to force it to make political concessions, and if this succeeded, to force the Soviet Union to abandon its ideology. The outcome of this plan is known to everyone.

**Attempts to Implement Bullying Policies Against the Soviet Union are Foolish**

Attempts to weaken the Soviet Union and implement bullying policies in relations with the Soviet Union have been foolish and futile in the past and remain so now.

Now, who cannot see that the strength of our country is in full bloom, and who can doubt that the peoples of the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist camp, as well as all progressive forces, possess powerful tools capable of restraining any war-loving adventurer. Now even leaders in the United States and other Western countries have had to admit that the Soviet Union has made great achievements in developing its economy and culture, and that it is increasingly strengthening its strength.

We have always pursued a policy of peace, and we will continue to do so, because this is how we act in accordance with the nature of the most peace-loving and most humane social system—the socialist system.

Who does not know that the Soviet Union has more than once concretely demonstrated its love of peace and its desire to ease international tensions?

It would take a lot of time just to list the most important, constructive and fully acceptable proposals that the Soviet government has recently submitted for consideration to the United Nations or to various Western countries. And how many peace proposals have the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries put forward! If these proposals had not been opposed by Western countries, especially the imperialist groups of the United States, and if they had been studied calmly, impartially, and realistically, the "Cold War" policy would have ended long ago, and significant achievements would have been made in easing international tensions.

Take the issue of disarmament, for example. The Soviet Union has repeatedly stated its position on the issue of disarmament, and the Soviet Union's proposals are aimed at thawing out this issue, which is of greatest concern to mankind, and finally freeing it from the deadlock.

The Soviet Union has always advocated a fundamental solution to the disarmament issue, advocating a complete and unconditional ban on atomic and hydrogen weapons, the removal of these weapons from the armaments of various countries, the destruction of existing stockpiles of such weapons, and a significant reduction in troops, armaments, and military expenditures, as well as the establishment of appropriate international supervision.

Therefore, we have put forward some of the most fundamental measures. We have made great efforts to reach a disarmament agreement with Western countries. Unfortunately, due to the attitude taken by Western countries during the London negotiations, we were unable to reach an agreement with them, and those negotiations were conducted in an extremely abnormal atmosphere. Can it be considered normal that the representatives of the four member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the Subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission opposed the Soviet Union and rejected any proposal put forward by the Soviet Union to reach a disarmament agreement. At the same time, the representatives of Western countries created the impression that negotiations were underway and had achieved some positive results, trying to confuse the public.

**The Soviet Union will continue to work to reach a reasonable disarmament agreement**

It is perfectly understandable that this situation cannot be tolerated any longer. At the recent session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet government put forward a proposal to establish a disarmament committee with the participation of all member states of the United Nations. However, this proposal was rejected under pressure from Western countries.

The People's Republic of Albania put forward a proposal to establish a smaller disarmament committee, in which at least half of the members would represent socialist countries and countries pursuing a neutral policy. This proposal was also rejected. This was a very reasonable proposal, but unfortunately it was not understood and supported. Under pressure from the United States, the United Nations established a new committee, which, although slightly enlarged, still has the same balance of power as the previous subcommittee. Not only that, but the Western countries also forced through a resolution that predetermined a program that was acceptable to them but had the nature of an ultimatum to peace-loving countries. Can it be considered a realistic policy to force the will of one part of the countries to be accepted by another part of the countries while rudely trampling on the basic principles of the United Nations and undermining its foundation?

The purpose of establishing the United Nations is to resolve disputes in a peaceful manner, and the resolutions it adopts should take into account the interests of all member states of the United Nations and be acceptable to them. However, the aforementioned resolution has a coercive form, which leads to discrimination against some peace-loving countries. The Soviet Union has stated that in the current situation, it will not participate in such a committee, because the vast majority of its members are countries participating in aggressive military blocs. If there is no other party in this committee, then what can it do. The work of such a committee will inevitably be futile and doomed to failure.

The Soviet Union will continue to work to reach a reasonable disarmament agreement, because the issue of disarmament is the most pressing issue in modern life. In order to achieve positive results, it is necessary to abandon the attempt to deliberately entangle the issue of disarmament with other political issues, such as the German issue, as Western countries have done so far.

**The Soviet Union Proposes Holding US-Soviet Talks and East-West Summit**

The Soviet Union has proposed convening a summit of the governments of socialist countries and capitalist countries to discuss, on an equal basis and in a realistic manner, the issues that have long been troubling mankind, including the issue of disarmament, and to seek solutions that are acceptable to all. We believe that before this meeting, a meeting of representatives of the two most powerful countries—the United States and the Soviet Union—could be held. There is little doubt that if the United States and the Soviet Union reach an agreement—of course, such an agreement should not harm the interests of other countries—the world situation would be greatly improved.

We have always believed that positive results can be achieved at the meeting of representatives of socialist and capitalist countries. What needs to be done to achieve this? First, such a meeting must not discuss issues where there are ideological differences, nor discuss the path of development for socialist and capitalist countries. We will let the people solve these issues themselves. Second, it is necessary to recognize the fact that there are socialist countries and capitalist countries, and it is necessary to refrain from interfering in each other's internal affairs, refrain from adopting "Cold War" tactics, and abandon attempts to change the status quo by force. If the representatives of Western countries start from the view that only the capitalist system exists and ignore socialist countries, then it will be impossible to reach an agreement on the basis of mutual understanding.

If Western countries recognize the status quo, then they can boldly agree to such talks, and they can easily reach agreements on many issues, creating conditions for the normalization of international relations and for people's peaceful and tranquil lives.

But some people tell us: It is no use talking with the Soviet Union, because it is irreconcilable and it maintains a "tough" stance, and even if agreements can be reached on some issues, the Soviet Union will not fulfill its obligations and will not keep its promises. There is no basis for such arguments.

**Dulles and his ilk slander that the Soviet Union has not implemented the Geneva Conference's resolutions, which is untenable**

This would not have been mentioned if some Western government officials had not made it a routine to deceive world public opinion. For example, Mr. Dulles, followed by Mr. Adenauer, recently insisted that the Geneva Four-Power Summit had reached an agreement on the reunification of Germany, and that the Soviet Union had not implemented the resolutions that had been adopted, which is inconsistent with reality and contrary to the facts. It is surprising that this fabrication by Mr. Dulles was repeated in the communiqué of the recently held Council meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Let us look at the facts. What agreements did the heads of government of the four countries actually reach at the Geneva Conference, and what was the Soviet Union's position at that time?

The heads of government of the four countries instructed the foreign ministers that "the settlement of the German question and the reunification of Germany through free elections should be carried out in a manner consistent with the national interests of the German people and the interests of European security."

In addition, the Soviet delegation specifically emphasized at the closing meeting that the Soviet government's starting point was that in resolving the German question, the following facts should be taken into account: It should be noted that there are two Germanys—the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany—and the issue of mechanically merging the two Germanys cannot be raised, nor can the German question be resolved without the participation of representatives of the two Germanys.

Finally, at the mass rally in Berlin, which was held immediately after the Geneva Conference, it was said that this issue must be resolved with the attitude that: "The German question should be resolved by the Germans themselves, and there is no doubt that they will be able to choose the correct path of development for Germany."

This is the Soviet government's position, and this is the position that our delegation took at the Geneva Four-Power Summit. We reiterated this position at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, which was subsequently held in Geneva. The Soviet Union reiterated at this conference that the German question should be resolved by the Germans themselves.

We still hold this attitude now. On what basis does Mr. Dulles insist that the Soviet Union is not fulfilling its obligations? Mr. Dulles' statements are obviously untenable, and even the bourgeois press has exposed these fabricated lies.

For example, on December 6, 1957, the well-known British commentator Scott wrote in the "Manchester Guardian" regarding Mr. Dulles' statement:

"Mr. Dulles is very likely to gain the reputation of a professional anti-Soviet person, for whom any action by the Soviet government seems suspicious, or even worse, simply because this action comes from the Soviet Union, without looking at the nature of this action. This is a reputation that the head of American foreign relations cannot afford to bear. When it is necessary and possible to maintain relations with the Russians, it is not beneficial to entrust those who openly do not intend to trust the Soviet government and therefore doubt whether it is worth negotiating with it to maintain these relations. But Dulles is precisely adopting this position.

"In a conversation with a 'BBC' correspondent in Washington on December 3, Dulles insisted that the Russians were the first nation to use tearing up treaties as a daily means of achieving their goals. After participating in twelve meetings with the Russians, he concluded that these meetings did not produce any benefits, 'mainly because the Soviet Union cannot be trusted to fulfill its promises.' To confirm this very extreme assertion, Dulles mentioned the summit meeting held in Geneva in July 1955. He insisted that this meeting reached an agreement on unifying Germany through free elections, but this agreement was destroyed by the Russians 'just two weeks' after it was signed."

Scott continued to write, "This statement is exactly the same as the kind of vague and one-sided reasoning that the Russians cleverly use in their propaganda, and this one-sided reasoning often makes those professional anti-Soviet people who are less pessimistic than Dulles despair and disbelieve in the Soviet Union's good intentions. The British and German communiqué of December 15 also expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the Soviet government has not yet fulfilled its 'obligation' to unify Germany through free elections, and this fact did not make the above-mentioned facts less one-sided. The only thing that was agreed upon at the Geneva Summit was the instructions given by the heads of government of the four countries to the foreign ministers as guiding principles for future negotiations..."

The commentator Scott quoted the words in the instructions given by the heads of government of the four countries to the foreign ministers, and he emphasized that there was no mention in the instructions that the Soviet government guaranteed to hold free elections in Germany regardless of whether other relevant issues could be agreed upon. Scott said: "Those who attended this summit certainly remember that the central point of contention between the Russian representatives and the Western representatives was which issue should take precedence: the unification of Germany or European security. In the end, both sides agreed that the two issues were directly related to each other, and the wording of the instructions actually clearly indicated this point."

It is worth noting that these kinds of opinions on Dulles's remarks are not isolated. Another British commentator, Crankshaw, who has not shown sympathy for the Soviet Union, wrote on this issue in the December 8 "Observer": "Regardless of the fact that it is the duty of the foreign minister to participate in negotiations (and if he feels he is not competent to fulfill this duty, then his duty is to resign), Dulles' assertion is completely inconsistent with the facts. The Russians never easily break agreements... Everyone knows that no such agreement was signed in Geneva."

This is the value of Mr. Dulles's statement! Can this kind of baseless statement help establish trust between countries and promote the correct resolution of international problems?

Comrades! The declaration and communiqué of the Council meeting of the North Atlantic Alliance (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), which was attended by the heads of government of the member states of the North Atlantic Group, have just been published. If we judge based on the remarks in foreign newspapers, then we should first point out the fact that, under the influence of public opinion, the issue of the Soviet government's letters was placed on the agenda of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting. The remarks of some heads of government of Western countries, who have actively treated the Soviet government's proposal for a meeting of heads of state to discuss pressing international issues, should be welcomed. It is worth noting that many leaders of Western delegations at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting were forced to talk about peace at the beginning and end of their speeches.

**The Paris Conference Pays Lip Service to Peace, but in Reality Still Maintains the "Cold War" Policy**

The documents of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization do indeed talk a lot about peace. For example, the declaration states:

"We are loyal to the Charter of the United Nations, and we reiterate that our alliance will never be used for aggressive purposes. We are always willing to resolve international problems through consultations, taking into account the legitimate interests of all parties. We strive to eliminate world tensions and intend to promote peace, economic prosperity, and social progress throughout the world." That's not bad!

The declaration points out, "We continue to firmly advocate comprehensive and supervised disarmament, and we believe that this disarmament can be achieved gradually. Despite the disappointing events, we are still willing to discuss any reasonable proposal for achieving this goal and laying a solid foundation for lasting peace. This is the only way to eliminate the unease caused by the arms race."

We in the Soviet Union also agree to sign this statement on peace and disarmament. But why can't the countries joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the countries joining the Warsaw Treaty formulate a joint declaration on mutual non-aggression? Why can't they undertake obligations to stop war cries, eliminate the state of "Cold War" and the expansion of armaments, abolish trade restrictions and discrimination, and develop scientific, cultural, and sports ties?

This will be a good start that meets the interests of all peace-loving people. (Long and enthusiastic applause)

The heads of government of the member states of the North Atlantic Group said that they did not come to Paris with aggressive intentions, and that the entire North Atlantic Treaty Organization and each country within it did not seek war, but longed for peace, and that they were only taking measures to guard against possible aggression. Since that is the case, and since no one intends to invade Western countries, then it should be said that favorable conditions are in place for easing international tensions and consolidating the cause of peace.

However, we cannot fail to notice that in the documents of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting, along with the words of hoping for peace and disarmament, there are also arguments that negate peaceful words. Obviously, the organizers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization encountered no small difficulties when drafting the declaration and communiqué, because they faced a task that was not easy. In view of the demands of all peace-loving people to stop the "Cold War" and stop the expansion of armaments, they had to include in their documents some words that paid lip service to peace. But they attached various reservations, conditions, and demands to these words, so that in reality, there was nothing correct left. The past policies of inciting the "Cold War" and expanding armaments are still being maintained.

**If Western countries act in accordance with their statements on peace, the Soviet Union will implement further disarmament**

If the leaders of the governments of the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization sincerely seek peace, they will receive the full mutual understanding and support of the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries, because these countries regard the consolidation of peace and the security of all peoples as their sacred duty. If everyone sincerely seeks peace, then war, as a means of resolving international disputes, will be eliminated. (Applause)

We hope that the forces of peace against the threat of new wars and the will of all peoples will surely triumph over the forces of war. The peoples of all countries will certainly be able to realize their hopes and will eventually force governments to seek solutions to problems on the path of peaceful coexistence. (Applause)

As for the Soviet Union, it will continue to devote itself to striving to stop the "Cold War", stop the arms race, build international trust, and develop friendly cooperation. However, it seems that it will take time to establish these relationships.

At the same time, it cannot be ignored that military spending is weighing on the shoulders of the masses of people, and the interests of improving the living conditions of hundreds of millions of people require urgent measures to stop the arms race. If the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization act in accordance with their statements on peace, the Soviet Union will take unilateral measures to further reduce its armed forces and reduce military expenditures, as it has done repeatedly in the past, in order to free up funds and forces for peaceful construction and improve the living conditions of the Soviet people. (Long and enthusiastic applause)

**In view of the North Atlantic Group's stepped-up nuclear arms race, the Soviet Union will take measures to strengthen its national defense**

We are political realists, so we cannot ignore the fact that the communiqué of the Council meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization includes statements that cannot be linked with peace rhetoric. The decision on the authority of the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to dispose of ballistic missiles, the storage of nuclear warheads in the territory of Western European countries, and the establishment of atomic bases and rocket weapon launch sites are all direct threats to the cause of peace. In view of these circumstances, the Soviet Union will take some measures to strengthen its defense capabilities and establish the necessary, modern means that can give the imperialists a devastating counterattack if they launch a new war. (Stormy applause)

We do not hide the fact that if an agreement cannot be reached on the issue of disarmament, the Soviet Union will be concerned with establishing the most advanced types of armaments. However, the Soviet Union will do so within appropriate limits, so as not to excessively burden the budget, excessively burden our economy, and excessively burden our people due to large expenditures in this regard.

The Soviet Union has repeatedly stated that the arms race must be stopped and weapons of mass destruction must be banned. The power of the latest types of armaments is

    在苏联最高苏维埃会议上
    赫鲁晓夫报告国际局势
    新华社22日讯  塔斯社莫斯科21日电：赫鲁晓夫在12月21日苏联最高苏维埃会议上的发言全文如下：
    代表同志们！
    请允许我就当前国际局势的一些问题发表意见。我完全同意外交部长葛罗米柯同志对最高苏维埃代表的询问的回答。
    如果我们讲到最近时期的国际上最重大的事，我们首先应当谈谈伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年庆典及共产党和工人党代表在莫斯科举行的会议。
    伟大十月革命四十周年成了和平与社会主义思想的胜利，苏联、中华人民共和国和所有社会主义国家及它们的和平外交政策的成就的国际示威。
    莫斯科会议标志着世界共产主义运动的胜利
    在十月革命四十周年庆典期间，社会主义国家共产党和工人党的代表以及六十四个国家共产党和工人党的代表在莫斯科举行了会议。在这些会议上通过了两个历史性的文件——社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言和和平宣言。
    正如苏共中央全会关于共产党和工人党代表会议结果的决议指出，这些会议令人信服地显示了社会主义阵营和整个国际共产主义运动在马克思列宁主义思想基础上的进一步团结。制定并宣布共产党人在世界历史现阶段中争取和平、民主和社会主义的最重要的任务，统一整个国际共产主义运动和进一步加强各兄弟党之间的联系——这些就是会议的基本结果。这些会议的历史意义在于，它们标志着世界共产主义运动和工人运动的最大的思想上和政治上的胜利，标志着无产阶级国际主义原则的胜利。这种在同志式的、热诚的气氛中进行的会议的结果是对帝国主义反动势力的计划的致命打击，这种反动势力最近花了不少气力想要分裂国际共产主义运动。
    所有国家的千百万共产党员、最广大的劳动人民群众热烈赞同两个会议通过的文件——两个宣言，这件事意味着帝国主义者和他们的奴才对世界共产主义运动发生“危机”的希望破灭了。
    社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言是在综合社会主义国家和资本主义国家的共产党的集体经验的基础上创造性地发展马克思列宁主义的榜样。
    各国共产党和工人党会议通过的和平宣言，在争取世界和平的斗争中具有巨大的历史意义。大家知道，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表团参加了各国兄弟党的会议，并一起通过了和平宣言。这个事实是在南斯拉夫共产党人同我们党以及同其他共产党和工人党进一步接近方面的一个新的进展。但是南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟没有参加社会主义国家兄弟党的会议，没有在宣言上签字。这是不好的因素吗？当然是，因为这证明南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟同社会主义国家所有的其他共产党和工人党在一些意识形态问题和政治问题上还存在着分歧。但是，很明显，目前的分歧比以前小了。在许多重要问题上，南斯拉夫共产党人是同一切共产党和工人党行动一致的。我们将继续执行同南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的兄弟人民友好和合作的政策，并且努力在不可动摇的马克思列宁主义原则的基础上加强同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的关系，克服意识形态问题和政治问题上现在还存在的分歧。
    两个会议通过的文件中，有许多地方称赞了我国工人阶级和它的战斗的先锋队——苏联共产党，因为它第一个胜利地完成了社会主义革命，在争取共产主义的斗争中取得了历史性的胜利。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    国际反动派削弱社会主义国家团结的打算完全破产
    社会主义的敌人过去和现在都集中火力攻击一切共产党，特别是攻击苏联共产党，这不是偶然的。我国工人阶级、苏联共产党树立了为反对剥削者、争取工人阶级利益、争取劳动人民利益、争取社会主义胜利而进行革命斗争的榜样。因此，形形色色的敌人总想贬低苏联在革命运动中的作用，力图破坏它的威信。可是他们这种企图一直没有得逞，就是将来也不会成功（掌声）。他们总想涣散革命的共产党和工人党的力量，分裂社会主义国家的团结。他们力图使一个社会主义国家同另一个社会主义国家对立起来，削弱革命力量的团结。
    帝国主义者企图以关心某些国家的“独立”作为幌子来掩饰自己旨在破坏社会主义国家团结的背信弃义的策略。当帝国主义集团在干反对社会主义国家团结的勾当的时候，竟把自己打扮成为某些国家独立和主权的捍卫者。而当他们谈到资本主义国家必须结成军事集团的时候，却要求自己的伙伴为了这种勾结而让出本国主权，同时硬说绝对的主权是没有的，说这是落后于时代的。
    就是将来我们也必须警惕，不要上当，要坚决一贯地奉行促进社会主义阵营国家团结一致的政策，根据列宁主义的和平共处原则奉行和平政策，奉行加强各国之间合作和友好关系的政策。
    共产党和工人党代表会议的结果证明，国际反动派想分裂和削弱社会主义国家的团结、破坏苏联的威信、削弱兄弟党同我国共产党的联系，这种打算已经完全破产了。会议的工作证实了各兄弟党对我们党和苏联人民有着深厚的同情。苏联的穷凶极恶的敌人现在也不得不承认苏联在全世界劳动人民中的威信是不可动摇的，所有兄弟党对我国共产党是深深信任的。（经久不息的掌声）
    共产党员和全体苏联人对这种信任的最好的回答就是我们为建设共产主义社会、为进一步提高苏维埃国家和整个社会主义阵营的威力进行忘我的斗争，为争取各国人民间的和平、为巩固同全世界劳动人民和民主力量的友谊进行不懈的斗争。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我们感谢所有我们的朋友对我们党和我国人民的功绩的信任和承认。我们向所有的朋友们和同志们声明：在争取共产主义胜利的今天，我们也像在争取十月革命胜利的日子中、像在国内战争和伟大卫国战争的前线进行斗争时那样精神焕发和朝气勃勃。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我们保持了伟大的革命热潮，我们向为工人阶级事业而奋斗的同志们保证，我们将永远忠实于马克思列宁主义原则、无产阶级国际主义原则，我们今后仍将把自己看做是曾经高举列宁旗帜、在列宁的领导下第一个向资本主义冲锋、到现在把这面旗帜胜利地举了四十年的先进队伍。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我们保证，我们将牢牢地举着列宁的旗帜，充满信心地向共产主义的胜利迈进，坚决为世界和平而斗争。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    社会主义国家坚持执行和平政策
    同志们！苏联、中华人民共和国、所有社会主义国家都坚定不移地执行着缓和国际紧张局势、停止“冷战”和军备竞赛、在不同社会制度的各国和平共处的基础上树立各国人民之间的持久和平的方针。这一方针乃是由社会主义国家外交政策的实质所决定的。这一方针得到了欧洲、特别是亚洲和非洲的许多国家的支持。资本主义国家中人民争取和平的运动规模越来越广泛了。
    不能不指出，日益众多的活动家主张停止“冷战”政策、停止军备竞赛和主张在和平共处的基础上建立各国之间的相互关系。
    我们向坚决为和平事业而斗争的卓越的国家活动家印度总理尼赫鲁、印度尼西亚总统苏加诺、缅甸总理吴努、埃及总统纳赛尔、叙利亚总统库阿特利以及其他国家活动家致敬。（经久不息的掌声）
    代表不同社会阶层的不同社会地位的人——自由职业者、企业主、政治家都抨击“冷战”政策。近来，各种不同人士，如加拿大外交部长史密斯、英国哲学家罗素、美国前驻苏联大使凯南、企业主伊顿、记者赫斯特以及资本主义国家许多其他社会人士和国家活动家，都主张必须更现实地估价国际舞台上力量的对比。
    爱好和平的人民欢迎这类声明，因为他们了解，在现代条件下战争意味着什么。
    但是，帝国主义国家的统治集团顽固地奉行着加剧国与国之间的关系、进一步扩大和加强侵略性的军事集团、继续扩张军备的路线。这些集团不顾人民的利益，不愿放弃外交政策中的侵略方针。这些集团执行着不大的、但有影响的一撮垄断资本家的意志，垄断资本家希望加剧和维持“冷战”状态，并指望它变成“热战”。人民的利益关他们什么事啊！ 他们很少关心人类的命运，他们一心渴望的是靠普通人的痛苦和灾难发财致富。帝国主义者有自己的座右铭——对和平事业越不利的事情对发财致富越有利。惊惶和不安的状况、人们对可能爆发原子战争的惧怕，这正是一种有利的局势，在这种局势下帝国主义者能最容易实现自己的计划，搜刮纳税人的钱去扩充军备。
    人民对战争歇斯底里和神经战已经厌烦了，他们对那种首先对劳动人民有重大压力的捐税的重担已经难以容忍了。如果算一算各国的军备竞赛所花的代价，人们就会吃惊，他们就会知道，有多少国民财富被白白地浪费了，而这些财富在其他条件下就可以用来提高人民的生活水平，发展经济和文化。
    问题是：如果使事情向和平和用和平方式解决争端的方向发展，而不是导向包藏着灾难性后果的原子战争，帝国主义者必须放弃“冷战”和军备竞赛政策，放弃用武力把世界改变得合乎垄断集团心意的希望。要知道帝国主义的“实力地位”政策的用意就在于：强制苏联接受西方国家的最后通牒式的要求，在有利于帝国主义者的条件下“解决”某些政治问题。
    例如，西方国家想“解决”关于人民民主国家的问题。但是他们的这种“解决”指的是什么呢？他们想用干涉这些国家的内政的方法，不顾人民的意志消灭劳动人民的社会主义成果，让资本家和地主的政权复辟。帝国主义者也经常谈到“解决”德国问题。他们如何理解这种“解决”呢？他们希望通过东德归并于西德的办法“统一”德国，也就是通过消灭德意志民主共和国的社会主义成果和加强西德的军事经济力量的办法“统一”德国，然后把用这种办法统一起来的德国拖入侵略性的北大西洋集团。大家看，他们希望我们自动地去加强德国的军国主义和复仇主义。
    这种“解决”政治问题的办法无异于蛮横政策和最后通牒的政策。用这种政策对付苏联在过去任何时候也没有成功过，现在更不会成功了（经久不息的掌声）。
    东西方应当通过和平谈判解决争执，不要彼此干涉内政
    我们正告西方国家的代表，首先是美国的代表，请把你们那种愚蠢的和已经声名狼借的“实力地位”政策扔到历史的垃圾箱里去吧。那里有它的位置！（经久不息的掌声）。
    让我们通过和平谈判的途径解决争执问题，冷静地、不要用蛮横的态度、根据平等的原则来讨论人类迫切关心的问题，让我们不要用战争来当做解决国际问题的手段，承认现状、也就是说承认世界上已经形成的局势、即存在着社会主义国家和资本主义国家的局势，不要彼此干涉内政。
    我们认为，不管两个制度——社会主义和资本主义——之间的意识形态分歧如何尖锐，我们必须用和平谈判的方法，而不是通过战争解决国际争执问题。我们建议用和平竞赛代替发明新型武器的竞赛。社会制度的胜利不取决于火箭，也不取决于原子弹和氢弹，而取决于哪个制度更能保证人们的物质和精神福利。
    我们认为，社会主义制度是社会组织的最高形式。让这种或那种社会制度体系不是在战争中、而是在和平的场合中，在发展社会生产力、科学、技术、文化方面，在为人的生活建立更好的条件方面来证明自己的优越性（经久不息的掌声）。
    请问，这里有什么不可以被不管是由那一种制度统治的所有国家接受的东西？但是西方最富侵略性的帝国主义集团不想取消“冷战”，并在寻找种种借口想要继续下去。帝国主义集团力图把苏联和其他爱好和平的国家吓唬住，指望这样就可以迫使苏联把更多的资金花在军事工业上，使它没有可能发展人民消费资料的生产。
    帝国主义害怕同社会主义制度和平竞赛
    事情的实际情况就是如此。帝国主义者害怕同社会主义制度和平竞赛，比害怕火还厉害。
    苏联和其他社会主义国家没有用战争去威胁任何人，他们不打算用武力强使任何人接受自己的思想和活动方式。他们提出的唯一的东西就是各国人民间的和平与友谊（掌声）。我们希望达到互相谅解，建立各国间的信任，结束煽动战争狂热和带来安宁，使人们能够和平地劳动。
    看来已经很明确了。可是有人却对我们说，这是宣传！ 是的，这是宣传，但不是宣传战争，而是宣传和平。因为苏联不同于美国，例如，在苏联认为宣传战争是最严重的罪行并且要受到法律制裁。可是宣传和平又有什么不好的呢！我们愿意每日每时地从西方国家那里听到这种宣传。可是与此相反，西方国家官方人士、将军们天天发出战争叫嚣和威胁性的声明：说可以用最新式战争武器来“消灭苏联”，把我国的许多城市、工业中心“消灭干净”。
    当他们想要用某种咒语辱骂苏联爱好和平的步骤的时候总是搬用“宣传”这个字眼。但是这样做的目的只不过是想用这种伎俩逃脱问题的实质罢了。因为，西方国家统治集团除了好战的侵略政策以外再没有甚么可以同苏联以及其他社会主义国家爱好和平的政策相对抗的了。
    近些日子，苏联政府给美国、英国、法国、德意志联邦共和国、意大利、土耳其、挪威、丹麦各国政府和其他北大西洋公约组织成员国政府以及联合国所有会员国政府的信成了全世界舆论注意的中心。苏联的新的和平倡议得到了一切珍视各国人民和平和安全事业的人们的拥护和支持。
    大家知道，苏联政府曾经表示愿意自1958年1月1日起不再进行核武器的任何爆炸，如果美国和英国也这样做的话。
    苏联建议拥有原子武器和氢武器的美国和英国不使用这种武器。苏联建议解散所有军事集团并且建立欧洲和亚洲集体安全体系，或者起码缔结一项北大西洋联盟参加国和华沙条约参加国互不侵犯条约。我们认为，目前有完全现实的条件在欧洲建立无原子武器和氢武器区。
    我们建议达成中近东局势的正常化；缔结苏美友好条约；采取停止战争宣传的措施；扩大贸易、科学、文化和体育联系。我们建议放弃歧视和限制，在互相尊重领土完整和主权，互不侵犯、互不因政治、经济和意识形态上的原因干涉对方内政、平等互利、和平共处的基础上建立国际关系。
    这就是我们的建议。苏联政府是怀着维护和巩固和平的真诚愿望提出这些建议的。我国的和平政策决不是软弱的表现。在这里回忆一下西方国家代表还在数年以前就纷纷谈论的话是适宜的，他们硬说苏联的和平政策和它关于必须缓和国际紧张局势的建议是我国经济软弱和技术落后的表现。因而，他们说，必须要对苏联施加压力，用实力威胁强迫苏联作出政治上的让步，如果这能成功的话，就要强使苏联放弃它的思想体系。这种计划的结局如何是大家都知道的。
    企图对苏联实行蛮横政策是愚蠢的
    削弱苏联的打算和在同苏联的关系上实行蛮横政策的企图，无论过去或现在都是愚蠢而徒劳无益的。
    现在谁会看不到，我们的国家的力量正在充分繁荣之中，现在谁会怀疑，苏联和社会主义阵营国家的人民以及所有进步力量掌握着能够约制任何战争冒险爱好者的强大工具。现在甚至美国和其他西方国家的领导人也不得不承认，苏联在发展自己的经济和文化方面获得了极大成就，它在日益加强自己的力量。
    我们过去和现在一贯执行和平政策，因为这是按照这个最爱好和平、最人道的社会制度——社会主义制度的本性行事的。
    谁不知道，苏联不止一次地具体证明了它的热爱和平和力图缓和国际紧张局势的愿望呢？
    只是把苏联政府在最近提交给联合国或是各个西方国家研究的最重要的具有建设性和完全可以接受的建议列举出来，也得花很多时间。而人民中国和其他社会主义国家又提出了多少和平建议啊！假如这些建议没有遭到西方国家、首先是美国帝国主义集团的反对，如果它们受到冷静地无偏见地和现实地研究，“冷战”政策早就会结束了，在缓和国际紧张局势方面早已获得了显著的成果。
    例如裁军问题。苏联再三表明了自己对裁军问题的立场，苏联的建议旨在使这个人类最最关心的问题解冻，并最后使它摆脱僵局。
    苏联在过去和现在一直主张根本解决裁军问题，它主张完全地和无条件地禁止原子武器和氢武器，从各国军备中取消这些武器，主张销毁这种武器的现有储备，主张大大减缩军队、军备和军事开支，并建立应有的国际监督。
    因此，我们这方面曾提出了一些最根本的措施。我们为了能同西方国家达成裁军协议尽了很大努力。很遗憾，由于西方国家在伦敦谈判期间所采取的态度，我们没有能同他们达成协议，那些谈判是在极其不正常的气氛中进行的。难道可以认为这样一个事实是正常的：在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会中北大西洋公约组织四个成员国的代表跟苏联对立，他们拒绝苏联为达成裁军协议提出的任何建议。同时西方国家的代表还造成了一种好像谈判在进行并取得了某些积极的结果的印象，企图混淆视听。
    苏联今后将努力争取达成合理的裁军协议
    完全可以理解，这种状况不能再容忍下去了。苏联政府在联合国最近一次大会会议上提出了关于建立一个联合国所有成员国参加的裁军委员会的建议。但是这一建议在西方国家的压力下遭到了否决。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国提出了关于建立一个规模较小的裁军委员会的建议，这个委员会中最低限度能有一半成员代表社会主义国家和奉行中立政策的国家，这项建议也被否决了。这是一项十分合理的建议，但可惜它没得到谅解和支持。联合国在美国的压力下建立了一个新的委员会，虽然这个委员会稍微扩大了一些，但其中的力量对比仍然和过去的小组委员会一样。不但如此，西方国家还强行通过了一项决议，这项决议事先决定了能为他们所接受、但对爱好和平的国家说来带有最后通牒性质的纲领。难道可以认为这样一种目的在于强迫一部分国家接受另一部分国家的意志，同时粗暴地蹂躏联合国的基本原则，破坏它的基础的政策是现实主义的政策吗？
    建立联合国的目的是为了用和平的方式解决争端，它所采取的决议应考虑到联合国所有成员国的利益并能为它们所接受。但是，上述决议具有强迫的形式，它导致对若干爱好和平的国家的歧视。苏联曾经声明，在目前的局面下它将不参加这样的委员会，因为这个委员会内绝大多数是参加侵略性的军事集团的国家。如果这种委员会内没有另一方，那么它能做些什么呢。这样的委员会的工作必将徒劳无益和遭到失败。
    苏联今后将努力争取达成合理的裁军协议，因为裁军问题是现代生活中最迫切的问题。为了达到积极的结果必须放弃像西方国家至今所做的那样，故意把裁军问题同其他政治问题如德国问题纠缠在一起的企图。
    苏联建议举行美苏会谈和东西方首脑会议
    苏联建议召开社会主义国家和资本主义国家政府首脑会议，以便在平等的基础上实事求是地讨论人类很久以来就为之不安的问题，其中包括裁军问题，并谋求大家可以接受的解决办法。我们认为，在这个会议之前可以举行两个最强大的国家——美国和苏联的代表的会见。未必可以怀疑，如果美国和苏联达成协议——当然这种协议不应损害其他国家的利益——那么世界局势将会大大地好转。
    我们过去和现在都认为，在社会主义国家和资本主义国家的代表会议上可以取得积极的成果。要做到这点需要怎样做呢，首先必须在这样一个会议上不讨论存在着意识形态上的分歧的问题，不讨论社会主义国家和资本主义国家沿着什么道路发展的问题。我们让人民自己来解决这些问题。第二、必须要承认存在着社会主义国家和资本主义国家这样一个事实，必须彼此不干涉内政、不采取“冷战”的手段和放弃用实力来改变现状的企图。如果西方国家的代表从只存在着资本主义制度的这种观点出发，而无视社会主义国家，那么要在互相谅解的基础上达成协议是不可能的。
    如果西方国家承认现状，那就可以大胆地同意这种会谈，那就能在许多问题上很容易地达成协议，为国际关系的正常化，为人们的安宁和和平的生活创造条件。
    但是有人对我们说：同苏联会谈是没有好处的，因为它是不调和的，它抱定“强硬的”立场，即使在某些问题上能够达成协议，苏联也会不履行它的义务，不守诺言。这类论调是没有任何根据的。
    杜勒斯之流诬蔑苏联没有执行日内瓦会议的决议是站不住脚的
    如果最近西方国家的某些官方人士不把蒙混世界舆论当做常规的话，本来可以不谈这一点的。例如，杜勒斯先生、接着是阿登纳先生，不久前硬说，日内瓦四国政府首脑会议已经就德国统一问题取得了协议，苏联没有执行所通过的决议，这种说法是不符合实际和违反事实的。值得惊奇的是，最近举行的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议公报中又重复了杜勒斯先生的这种捏造。
    让我们来看看事实，在日内瓦会议上四国政府首脑究竟取得了什么协议和苏联当时的立场是怎样的呢？
    四国政府首脑给外交部长们的指示说，“德国问题的解决和通过自由选举重新统一德国的工作应该在符合德国人民民族利益和欧洲安全利益的情况下进行”。
    此外，苏联代表团在闭幕会议上特别着重指出，苏联政府的出发点是，在解决德国问题的时候，应当考虑下面的事实：应当注意到有两个德国——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国存在，不能提出机械地把两个德国合并的问题以及不能在没有两个德国的代表参加下解决德国问题。
    最后，在日内瓦会议刚刚结束以后举行的柏林群众大会上，曾经说过，必须抱着这样的态度解决这个问题：“由德国人自己来解决德国问题，毫无疑问，他们是能够选择德国的正确发展道路的”。
    这就是苏联政府的立场，就是我国代表团在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议上所采取的立场。随后在日内瓦召开的外长会议上我们又再次阐明了这一立场。苏联在这次会议上再次强调指出，德国问题应当由德国人自己解决。
    我们现在仍然是抱这种态度。杜勒斯先生根据什么硬说苏联不履行自己的义务呢？杜勒斯先生的声明显然是站不住脚的，甚至资产阶级报刊也揭露了这些伪造的胡言谰语。
    例如，在1957年12月6日英国著名评论员斯科特在“曼彻斯特卫报”上曾就杜勒斯先生的声明写道：
    “杜勒斯先生大有可能获得职业反苏家的名声，对这种人说来，苏联政府的任何行动似乎都是可疑的，甚至更坏些，只是因为这种行动是来自苏联，而不看这种行动的性质。这是美国外交关系负责人不敢担当的名声。在必需和有可能同俄国人保持关系的时候，让那些公然不打算信任苏联政府因而也就怀疑同它进行谈判是否有价值的人来担负维持这些关系的责任，是没有好处的。但是杜勒斯正是采取的这种立场。
    “杜勒斯在12月3日同‘英国广播公司’驻华盛顿记者谈话时硬说，俄国人是第一个把撕毁条约作为达到自己目的的日常手段的民族。在参加了十二次同俄国人开的会议后，他得出结论说，这些会议没有产生什么好处，‘主要是因为，不能信赖苏联履行自己的诺言。’杜勒斯为了证实这种非常极端的论断，提到了1955年7月在日内瓦举行的最高级会议。他硬说，这次会议达成了用自由选举方法统一德国的协议，但是这项协议签字后‘不过两周’就被俄国人破坏了”。
    斯科特继续写道，“这种说法恰好同俄国人在自己的宣传中所巧妙利用的那种含糊的片面道理一样，这种片面道理往往使那些在程度上不如杜勒斯的职业反苏家悲观失望，不相信苏联的善良愿望。英国和德国12月15日的公报也对苏联政府还不履行它的通过自由选举统一德国的‘义务’表示不满，这一事实也并没有使得上述事实更少带片面性。在日内瓦高级会议上唯一取得协议的东西，就是四国政府首脑作为未来谈判的指导原则给外交部长们的指示……”
    评论员斯科特引述了四国政府首脑给外交部长们的指示中的文句，他着重指出，指示中一点也没有提到苏联政府保证在德国举行自由选举而不问其他有关问题是否能达成协议。斯科特说：“出席这次最高级会议的人当然记得，俄国代表和西方代表们之间的中心分歧点是，德国统一和欧洲安全这两个问题哪一个该占首位。最后，双方同意两个问题彼此有直接关系，指示的措词实际上也清楚地表明了这点。”
    值得注意的是，对杜勒斯的谈话表示这类意见的，并不是个别的。另一位并不曾表现过同情苏联的英国评论员克兰克萧在12月8日的“观察家报”上就这一问题写道：“姑不论外交部长的职责就是参加谈判（如果他感觉自己不能胜任这一职责，那么他的职责就是辞职），杜勒斯的断言根本同事实不符。俄国人绝不轻易破坏协定……每一个人都知道，在日内瓦并没有签订任何这类的协定。”
    杜勒斯先生的声明的价值就是这样！难道这类没有任何根据的声明会有助于各国间建立信任、能够促进国际问题的正确解决吗？
    同志们！由北大西洋集团成员国政府首脑参加的北大西洋联盟（北大西洋公约组织）理事会会议的宣言和公报刚刚发表。如果根据外国报纸的言论来判断，那么首先应当指出这样一个事实：在舆论的影响下，关于苏联政府的信件问题被列入了北大西洋公约组织会议的议程。应当欢迎这样一些西方国家政府首脑的言论，这些人积极地对待苏联政府的信件所提出的关于各国首脑会见以讨论当前迫切的国际问题的主张。值得注意的是，许多西方国家代表团的领导人在北大西洋公约组织会议上被迫在自己发言的开头和末尾都谈一番和平。
    巴黎会议侈谈和平，实际上仍然保持“冷战”方针
    在北大西洋公约组织会议的文件中的确也大谈其和平。例如，宣言中讲到：
    “我们忠于联合国宪章，我们重申，我们的联盟决不会被用于侵略的目的。我们始终愿意在考虑到一切方面的正当利益的情况下通过商谈来解决国际问题。我们争取消除世界紧张局势，并且打算促进全世界的和平、经济繁荣和社会进步。”说得不坏！
    宣言指出，“我们继续坚定地主张实行广泛而有监督的裁军，我们认为这种裁军是能够逐步实现的。尽管发生了令人失望的事，但是我们仍然愿意讨论关于达到这种目的并且奠定持久和平的巩固基础的任何合理建议。这是消除由于军备竞赛而产生的不安的唯一方法。”
    我们苏联也同意在这种关于和平和裁军的声明上签字。但是为什么加入北大西洋公约组织的国家和加入华沙条约的国家就不能制定一项关于互不侵犯的联合宣言呢。为什么不能承担起义务，来制止战争叫嚣、消除“冷战”和扩充军备的状态、取消贸易方面的限制和歧视、发展科学、文化和体育方面的联系呢？
    这将是一个符合所有爱好和平人民的利益的良好开端。（经久不息的掌声）
    北大西洋集团各成员国的政府首脑说，他们不是抱着侵略的意图来巴黎开会的，整个北大西洋公约组织和其中每一个国家都不追求战争，他们渴望和平，他们只是采取措施，防备可能的侵略。既然如此，既然又没有人打算侵略西方国家，那么，应该说缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平事业的有利环境是具备了。
    但是，我们不能不注意到：在北大西洋公约组织会议的文件中，同希望和平和希望裁军的字句一起，还包括否定和平言辞的论点。显然，北大西洋公约组织的组织者在拟定宣言和公报的时候碰到了不小的困难，因为他们面临着一个不容易的任务。鉴于所有爱好和平的人民要求停止“冷战”和停止扩充军备，他们不得不在自己的文件中列入一些侈谈和平的言辞。但是他们又给这种言辞附上各种保留、条件和要求，这样，正确的东西实际上就一点也没有了。结果还是保持着过去的煽动“冷战”和扩充军备的方针。
    西方各国如果遵循它们的和平声明办事，苏联将实行进一步裁军
    如果北大西洋公约组织成员国政府的领导人真诚地谋求和平，他们就会得到苏联和一切爱好和平国家的充分相互谅解和支持，因为这些国家把巩固和平和各国人民安全视为自己的神圣职责。如果大家都真诚地谋求和平，那么，作为解决国际争端的手段的战争就会消除。（掌声）
    我们希望，反对新战争威胁的和平力量和各国人民的意志一定会战胜战争势力。各国人民一定能够实现自己的希望，终于会迫使政府在和平共处的途径上谋求问题的解决。（掌声）
    至于苏联，它将来也要致力于争取停止“冷战”，停止军备竞赛，建立国际信任和发展友好合作。但是，看来建立这些关系是需要时间的。
    同时，不能不考虑到，军费压在人民群众肩上，改善亿万人民生活条件的利益要求采取紧急措施停止军备竞赛。如果北大西洋公约组织成员国遵循它们的和平声明办事，苏联就会像它过去屡次做到的那样，采取进一步裁减自己武装部队和缩减军费的单方面措施，以便腾出经费和力量来用于和平建设和改善苏联人民的生活条件。（经久不息的掌声）
    鉴于北大西洋集团加紧核备战，苏联将采取措施加强国防
    我们是政治上的现实主义者，因此不能不考虑到，北大西洋公约组织理事会会议公报包括着同和平言论怎样也联不在一起的说法。关于北大西洋公约组织武装部队最高总司令有权支配弹道导弹的决定，在西欧国家领土上储存核弹头，建立原子基地和火箭武器发射场，这一切都是对和平事业的直接威胁。考虑到这些情况，苏联将采取一些措施来加强自己的防御能力，建立必要的、现代化的、一旦帝国主义者发动新战争的时候能够给他们以毁灭性还击的手段。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我们毫不隐讳，如果裁军问题不能达成协议，苏联将关心建立最新型的军备。不过，苏联将在适当的范围内这样做，以便不致使预算负担过重，使我们的经济负担过重，使我们的人民因为这方面的开支很大而负担过重。
    苏联一再声明必须停止军备竞赛和禁止大规模毁灭性武器。最新式的军备的威力极大，以致一旦在战争中使用它们就会使一系列国家的生存遭到威胁。如果爆发战争，在本国领土上设有北大西洋公约组织军事基地的国家以及为了侵略目的建立这些军事基地的国家将遭到毁灭性的还击。现在，没有任何角落可供侵略者藏身以逃脱正义的制裁。
    因此，挪威首相基哈德森先生和丹麦首相汉森先生的理智的声明不能不令人欢迎，他们由于考虑到本国人民的民族利益而拒绝在本国领土上配置火箭武器和核武器。不能不指出某些欧洲国家政府同意在本国领土上建立原子基地和火箭发射场而可能引起的严重后果。
    希望对于在本国领土上建立军事基地要负责任的领导人及时悬崖勒马
    意大利和土耳其的政府人士的战争热狂使我们感到有些惊奇。他们主张用原子武器和氢武器武装起来，主张在本国领土上建立火箭发射基地。这真是令人不解。意大利由于地理位置关系，实质上不可能使用弹道火箭和其他火箭而不破坏意大利同苏联之间的其他国家的中立。大家知道，弹道火箭只能直线飞行。大家也都知道，军事基地和火箭发射场是用来反对苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的。但是，从意大利基地上利用这种火箭进攻苏联而不损害奥地利和南斯拉夫主权是不可能的。可以不必怀疑，爱好和平的各国人民将大声疾呼，反对这种威胁。
    我们的邻国土耳其的领导人的态度是令人遗憾的。在土耳其的领土上建立原子基地和火箭场，这使国内和平居民遭受灾祸的威胁。看来，有好战情绪的土耳其领导人没有足够地意识到，他们所向往的东西有多么热，他们忘了有可能烧伤自己的手的。（经久不息的掌声）
    这对于其他一些其领导人同意建立军事基地的国家来说也是如此。
    应当认为，明智一定会占上风，那些对于在本国领土上建立军事基地要负严重责任的领导人会及时地悬崖勒马，不让别人把自己引上军事冒险的道路。
    谁不明白，原子基地和火箭发射场在一旦发生军事冲突的时候将成为吸引人的目标，将遭受毁灭性的回击。我们完全不想吓唬任何人。我们谈这些话的目的是为了警告：那些按照侵略性军事集团组织者的意志变为军事基地的国家将遭到何等可怕的危险。这种事情是不能开玩笑的！
    载有氢弹的美国飞机在各国上空盘旋危险极大
    西方国家，首先是美国的领导人要在别国的领土上建立军事基地的时候想使人相信，建立这些基地是为了保卫人民的安全。但是，这是欺骗。事实上，现代军事基地不可避免地将使许多国家的和平居民遭受毁灭的威胁。
    载有原子弹和氢弹的大批美国军用轰炸机日以继夜地在有美国空军基地的各国上空盘旋，单就这一点也可以判断出，这种危险有多么大。
    大家可以想像得到，假如一个飞行员，就算不是出于恶意，而是由于神经错乱或不正确地理解了命令，他就会把致人死亡的运货投到某个国家的领土上。那时，按着战争的逻辑来看，接着而发生的就是瞬息之间的反击。这样就可能爆发世界大战。
    但是可以想像得到的还有另一种情况：在设有空军基地的国家的领土上空作所谓“防御”飞行时，尽管技术完善，在空中还是可能发生事故或技术故障的。那时，致人死亡的运货就会毁灭这些飞机好像加以保卫的那个国家的和平居民。可能造成几百万人的死亡。
    正像大家所看到的，在保卫各国人民安全的幌子下所建立的原子基地，实际上每时每刻都以死亡威胁着这些国家的人民。建立有军事基地的国家的人民甚至在和平时期也可能成为原子武器和氢武器的第一批牺牲品，他们认识到这一点和体会到这一点吗？
    必须趁早改变主意和使那些拿各国人民的命运当儿戏的人规矩点儿。人们应该拿出力量来及时制止军事冒险者。
    哪里有人民，那里就有共产主义思想，想消灭它是不可能的
    帝国主义侵略集团的组织者企图用国际共产主义“威胁”和共产主义要统治世界的叫嚣来掩饰他们的真正意图。
    例如，在北大西洋公约组织会议的宣言中毫无根据地硬说：“共产党统治者们再一次地发出了清楚的警告，表示他们决心继续努力争取控制全世界，可能时依靠颠覆活动，必要时依靠暴力。”
    又是老一套！共产党人在他们为劳动人民的利益而进行英勇斗争的数十年期间，曾不止一次地听过这种没有任何根据的叫嚣。但是由表现工人阶级和所有劳动人民的根本利益的科学的共产主义的崇高思想所鼓舞着的共产党人，始终沿着自己的道路，从胜利走向胜利。所以共产党人没有必要强求别人接受自己的思想。共产主义思想是我们时代最先进的思想，哪里有人民，那里就有共产主义思想。消灭这种思想是不可能的，正像不能消灭人民一样。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    历史发展过程是铁面无私的。任何反动势力都阻挡不了它。如果他们企图用武力做到这一点和挑起战争，那么他们就是自己为自己挖掘坟墓。各国人民将不能再忍受那种引起战争和给人类带来痛苦和灾难的制度。
    两种制度的和平共处和和平竞赛是唯一的出路
    所以唯一的出路是两种制度的和平共处和它们的和平竞赛。
    不同社会制度的国家和平共处的主张受到所有爱好和平的人民的一致拥护。这种主张得到联合国大会最近一次会议的支持，会议号召各国“尽力来巩固国际和平、发展友好关系和合作以及用和平的方式解决争端”。由此看来，和平共处的原则得到了世界上大多数国家的代表的赞同。
    北大西洋公约组织理事会会议的公报说，会议参加国讨论了中东局势，并且表示支持这个地区的国家的独立和主权。但是，会议的参加国没有勇气来谴责英国、法国和以色列对埃及的侵略行为，而这三个侵略国家中就有两个是北大西洋联盟成员国。如果看到英勇的埃及人在一年多以前流了鲜血，那么，所谓“独立”和“主权”这类词句能有什么价值呢。仅仅由于爱好和平的国家、其中包括苏联的干预，才制止了有转变成世界大战的危险的侵略。（掌声）
    有些主张扩充军备的人公开说，减少军事定货会引起发展经济方面的严重困难，会使得生产下降和造成失业。只有对人类的命运毫不在乎的人才能有这种想法。
    难道可以把一小撮垄断资本家的利益放在整个民族利益的上面和依靠亿万人民的灾难来治理垄断资本家的事业吗？难道不能利用资本主义各国雄厚的生产能力来生产和平产品以满足各国人民迫切的需求吗？难道在美国没有千百万人民过着贫困的生活，难道在那里没有贫民窟和大批流离失所的人吗？这种状况在任何一个资本主义国家都存在着。难道不能把耗费在军备竞赛上的亿兆资金用来发展和平经济、改善人民的生活，给那些正是由于几世纪来受帝国主义殖民主义者的掠夺而贫困的弱小国家的人民以经济援助吗？（鼓掌）
    如果在东西方各国贸易中消除了限制和歧视，拆除了障碍，就会给美国、英国、法国、西德提供销售和平产品的广泛的可能性。这将有助于各国人民生活的改善。扩大以互利为基础的贸易，发展科学、文化和体育联系将促进各国人民的接近、将促进各国在和平共处原则的基础上的合作。
    目前存在着巩固和平的有利条件
    在估计现今国际局势的时候，必须承认，目前存在着巩固和平的有利条件。
    苏联人民今后仍将不遗余力地捍卫和平事业，加强各国人民之间的友谊，坚定不移地遵循共产党和苏联政府的列宁的和平外交政策的伟大原则。（经久不息的掌声）
    代表同志们！
    1957年即将结束了，我们现在正处在新的1958年的前夕。1957年过得很好！我想，1958年将更加美好！（经久不息的掌声）
    过去的一年给苏联各族人民在发展工业、提高农业、提高文化和人民物质福利方面带来了很大的成就，带来了辉煌的科学技术成就，带来了在加强我们国家的国际地位和进一步提高它的威望方面的成就。可以作为这一年的标志的是，我们光荣的科学家、工程师、技术人员和工人树立了具有真正历史意义的功绩，他们制成了世界上第一批环绕我们行星飞行的人造地球卫星。这些卫星为我国人民的成就和社会主义思想的胜利增添了光彩，并且宣扬了苏联科学技术的进步。1957年将作为全体进步人类隆重庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的一年，作为世界共产主义运动力量的团结和辉煌的胜利的一年以及作为国际帝国主义和反动势力进一步削弱的一年载入史册。
    苏联人民将竭力使未来的一年成为和平的一年
    我们正在满怀着对自己未来的信心进入新的1958年。在这一年共产党和全体苏联人民的注意力将集中在执行根据苏共第二十次代表大会的决议所制定的共产主义建设的宏伟任务上。伟大的列宁称我们的党是革新者的党，因为在它的领导下将建成新的共产主义社会。最近举行的苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议讨论了兄弟共产党和工人党的会议结果和苏联工会工作的问题。苏联最高苏维埃这次会议讨论和批准了1958年的国家计划和国家预算。中央委员会全体会议和最高苏维埃会议通过了一些重要的决议，这些决议的实现将能保证所有国民经济部门的进一步高涨、物质福利和文化水平的提高以及广大劳动群众的创造性的主动精神和积极性的增长。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们满怀希望地迎接即将来到的新的一年，新的一年将使苏联人民——创造者和建设者在共产主义社会的建设中获得新的成就。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我们将竭尽一切努力使即将到来的1958年成为和平的一年，成为“冷战”衰落或完全消除的一年，让人们能过不为自己的命运、不为自己的孩子、妻子和母亲的命运感到不安的生活。让两个体系在和平的基础上，在经济和文化高涨、更充分地满足人们物质和精神需求的基础上展开竞赛。（经久不息的掌声）
    苏联人民在从事和平劳动。为了巩固和平事业，苏联人民将坚决为完成会议所通过的计划，为加强苏维埃国家的威力，为提高劳动人民物质福利而斗争。
    我们预祝全体苏联人民在他们为我们伟大社会主义祖国谋幸福的创造性劳动中获得成就，我们预祝每个苏联家庭，每个苏联公民在新的一年中如意幸福！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    光荣属于共产主义的建设者——伟大的苏联人民和他们的久经考验的领袖——苏联共产党！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    在共产党的领导下，在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下沿着建设共产主义的大道前进！（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声。全体起立）
