    Teaching Children to Draw
    Wang Yunhua
    Drawing is one of children's favorite activities. As parents, you can use this activity to provide various lively and engaging forms of education for your children. When children pick up a pen to draw, they will recall interesting things in their lives, which will develop their thinking skills and creative talents, and help them to broadly understand life.
    We often see children drawing large-headed figures, houses without doors, and two-legged bears on paper, the ground, and walls, etc. They proudly show their "masterpieces" to their parents, hoping to receive praise. However, some parents do not value this expression of their children's desire for knowledge. They think that children are just playing around when they draw, so they ignore the children's actions; sometimes, when they see that the children's drawings are messy, they frown, and even scold the children for wasting paper.
    Children have a desire to draw from an early age, and adults should guide them in a timely manner and patiently teach them to draw, and not be indifferent. Some parents kindly buy colored pencils, paper, and some pictures for their children and say, "Good children, learn to draw!" As a result, the children scribble on the paper indiscriminately. They don't know how to draw a round ball or what color to use for the leaves of a tree. It is obviously not a good way to just let children copy pictures without giving them any guidance. In this way, children just copy the model and cannot develop their rich imagination of things.
    How to guide children to draw?
    The most important thing is to enrich children's knowledge. Young children's understanding of some objects and things is not complete or correct. They often don't think that houses have doors, and they don't understand that bears have four legs, so of course they draw things that "don't resemble anything." This requires adults to guide children to observe common objects around them at any time. When parents play with their children, they should encourage them to look and think more, so that they can leave a deep impression on the outside world. For example, guide children to pay attention to the fact that trees are tall, branches grow on the trunk, leaves grow on the branches, and the color of the leaves is green; houses have doors and windows, what is the difference between doors and windows, and so on. You can also ask children thought-provoking questions, such as if a child draws a doll without ears, you can say to him, "Xiaohong, what do you use to hear sounds?" "How many ears do you have?" The child will naturally add two ears to the doll he drew.
    When children start to draw, they often draw randomly without being conscious of what they are doing. Adults should pay attention to guiding children from unconscious random drawing to conscious learning to draw. For example, if a child draws a circle on paper, you can say to him, "Yan Yan drew something that looks a lot like a ball!" When a child draws some curves with crayons, say, "Look, aren't these mountains?" In this way, you can inspire children to think about some things and increase their interest in drawing. Gradually, children will consciously draw a ball, a tree, a house, and other things that they are familiar with.
    Teaching children to draw should be based on the characteristics of the children's age, progressing from simple to complex. If a child draws a house without doors or windows, adults can let him observe the appearance of the house, and then tell him: where the door should be drawn, where the window should be drawn; draw a tree next to the house, draw some mountains in the distance, draw a sun in the sky,…. Gradually make appropriate demands from the things children are familiar with. If the requirements are too high, the child will not be able to draw and will easily reduce his interest in drawing.
    Drawing also reflects children's attitudes towards things. Adults should pay attention to cultivating children's beautiful emotions and moral character through drawing. When children draw "the wolf and the little rabbit", they always keep the wolf and the little rabbit far apart. In the child's innocent heart, he worries that the little rabbit will be eaten by the wolf; when they draw "mom", they always paint mom with colorful colors, because they love mom the most, so they put beautiful clothes on mom.... Older children are willing to draw the things they like the most, such as they love to draw "people's police directing traffic", "young pioneers holding red flags", "flying kites", etc. We must inspire them to actively reflect the things around them.
    When children often repeat drawing something, parents should guide them to add fresh content. "Draw a doll!" "Draw a little rabbit!" So the child starts drawing. Maybe he doesn't draw it well, or even draws it badly, but that's okay. As long as parents pay attention to encouraging him, rather than ridiculing him, the child will be happy to modify it.
    When guiding children to draw, you should also pay attention to the child's posture, and let the child sit upright; you should also pay attention to the light, and do not draw in too strong or too dark light, which will damage the child's eyes.
    Drawing can inspire children's thinking, develop their observation skills, creativity, and cultivate children's artistic interests. In the family, we may as well prepare some paper and pens for the children and let them draw. (Attached picture)

    教孩子画画
    王蕴华
    画画，是孩子们最喜爱的一项活动。做父母的通过这项活动，可以对孩子进行各种生动活泼的教育。当孩子们拿起笔来画画的时候，他们会想起生活中各种有趣的事情，这样就会发展孩子的思维能力和创造才能，帮助孩子广泛地认识生活。
    我们常常看到孩子们在纸上、地上、墙上画着许多大头的小人、没有门的房子和两条腿的小熊，等等。他们得意地把自己的“佳作”拿给爸爸妈妈看，希望得到父母的夸奖。可是，有些做父母的并不重视孩子这种求知欲的表现。他们认为小孩子随便画一画，不过是玩一玩罢了，因此不理会孩子的这种举动；有时，看到孩子画得乱七八糟，就皱起眉头，甚至还责骂孩子浪费了纸张。
    孩子从小就有画画的要求，大人应当及时地指导他们，耐心地教孩子画画，不能漠不关心。有的家长好心好意地给孩子们买了彩色笔、纸和一些图画，对孩子说：“好孩子，学着画画吧！”结果，孩子在纸上胡乱涂抹起来，他们不知道怎么把皮球画成圆的，树的叶子用什么颜色。只让孩子照图画临摹，而不加指导的办法，显然是不好的。这样，孩子只是照样本画，不能发展他们对事物丰富的想像。
    怎样指导孩子画画呢？
    最重要的是丰富孩子们的知识。年龄小的孩子，对一些物体和事物的认识还不完整、不正确，他们往往想不到房子还有门，弄不清楚小熊有四条腿，当然画得“四不像”。这就需要成人随时引导孩子观察周围常见的物体。父母和孩子在一起玩的时候，要启发孩子多看多想，使他对外界的事物留下深刻的印象。比如，引导孩子注意树是高大的，树干上长着树枝、树枝上长着叶子，叶子的颜色是绿的；房子有门、有窗，门和窗有什么不同，等等。还可以向孩子提出启发性的问题，如孩子画了一个没有耳朵的娃娃，你就对他说：“小红，你用什么听声音呀？”“你有几只耳朵呀？”孩子很自然地就会给自己画的娃娃添上两只耳朵。
    孩子们开始画画的时候，常常是无意识的乱画。大人应当注意引导孩子从无意识的乱画到有意识的学画。例如，孩子在纸上随便画了一个圆圈，就对他说：“燕燕画得多像一个皮球啊！”当孩子用蜡笔画了一些曲线的时候，就说：“你看，这不是一座一座的小山吗？”这样，就可以启发孩子去想一些事物，并且增加了画画的兴趣。慢慢地，孩子就会有意识地画一个皮球、一棵树、一座房子和其他一些他所熟悉的东西了。
    教孩子画画，应当根据孩子年龄的特点，从简单逐渐能到复杂。孩子画了一座没有门窗的房子，大人就可以让他观察一下房子的样子，然后告诉他：门应当画在什么地方，窗子应当画在什么地方；房子旁边画上棵树，远处画一些山，天空画一个太阳，……。从孩子们熟悉的事物中，逐渐提出适当的要求。要求过高，孩子不会画，容易减低画画的兴趣。
    在绘画中，也反映着孩子对待事物的态度。大人要注意通过画画培养孩子优美的情绪和道德品质。孩子们画“狼和小兔”，总是把狼和小兔隔得很远，在孩子天真的心灵里，他耽心小兔被狼吃掉；他们画“妈妈”，总在妈妈身上涂得五颜六色，因为他们最爱妈妈，所以给妈妈穿上了美丽的服装……。大一点的孩子都愿意把自己最喜欢的事情画出来，比如他们最爱画“人民警察指挥交通”、“少年先锋队员拿红旗”、“放风筝”等。我们要启发他们积极地去反映周围事物。
    当孩子们经常重复地画一件东西的时候，父母应当引导他增加新鲜的内容。“画个娃娃吧！”“画只小兔吧！”于是孩子动手画起来了。也许他画得并不像、甚至画坏了，这不要紧。只要父母注意鼓励他，而不是耻笑他，孩子会乐意修改的。
    在指导孩子画画时，还要注意孩子的姿式，让孩子坐端正；也要注意光线，不能在太强或太暗的光线下面画，那会损害孩子的眼睛。
    画画，可以启发孩子的思维、发展孩子的观察力、创造力，培养孩子的艺术兴趣。在家庭里，我们不妨给孩子准备些纸、笔，让孩子们画画吧。（附图片）
