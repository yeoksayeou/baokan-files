Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit is about to kick off in Paris in a day.

The task of this conference is to expand war preparations, which is already well known. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles publicly stated at a press conference on December 10 that the mission of this conference is to "activate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization" and clearly hinted that he believed the main means to achieve this goal was to deploy rocket weapons in Western Europe. Mobilizing all the military forces of the "Atlantic" countries and formulating military strategic plans aimed at the widespread use of nuclear weapons—these are the main agenda items of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Paris Conference.

However, the United States' calculations are not entirely satisfactory. Its plot to establish missile bases and encroach on the sovereignty of other North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries has been met with fierce opposition from political circles in many countries.

Danish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hansen said on December 13 upon arriving in Paris that he would reiterate at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit that Denmark opposes the storage of atomic nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles on its territory. He also stated that Denmark opposes the stationing of foreign troops. He said that under the current circumstances, it is inappropriate to allow foreign troops to be stationed during peacetime.

The French Republican Senate passed a motion early on the morning of December 13 by an overwhelming majority of 274 votes to 14, requiring the government not to undertake any obligations regarding the establishment of foreign military bases on French territory without parliamentary authorization.

A recent London dispatch published in the Paris weekly "French Observer" pointed out that although the British government is closely following the United States in forcing its North Atlantic allies to spare no effort in preparing for nuclear war, "nuclear neutralism" is also developing within Britain.

The British people are alarmed by the fact that American planes taking off from British bases are carrying hydrogen bombs. The dispatch said: "Therefore, several moderate, conservative Labour MPs who have always been uninterested in foreign affairs also advocated 'nuclear pacifism' in the days after Lloyd made a statement in the House of Commons (regarding American planes carrying hydrogen bombs). Currently, the idea of European neutralization has resurfaced."

The dispatch pointed out that the proposals made recently by American politician Kennan on the BBC regarding Germany not being equipped with nuclear weapons and the withdrawal of American, British, and Soviet troops from Eastern and Western Europe have received such widespread support from the British people that even "The Times" has abandoned its propaganda advocating the rearmament of West Germany and advocated the demilitarization of Central Europe.

At the plenary session of the West German Federal Parliament on the morning of December 12, a vote was held on the Social Democratic Party's proposal to conduct a foreign policy debate before the opening of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit. The ruling Christian Democratic Party relied on its majority in parliament to reject the proposal. However, the Social Democratic Party's proposal was supported by the Free Democratic Party parliamentary group and some members of the German Party.

The Social Democratic Party's proposal requested the West German government to clearly state to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Paris Conference that West Germany opposes equipping its army with atomic weapons and refuses to cooperate in the development of atomic weapons; West Germany refuses to establish missile launch bases on its territory; stop atomic weapons tests; the West German government suggests holding negotiations with relevant countries on establishing a "non-atomic weapons zone"; all relevant countries should negotiate the withdrawal of their troops from German territory; and the overall policy direction of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should be reviewed based on the latest developments in the situation.

### 西欧政界担心巴黎会议玩火  反对在本国建立美国原子基地

　　西欧政界担心巴黎会议玩火
    反对在本国建立美国原子基地
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：还有一天，北大西洋集团首脑会议就要在巴黎开锣了。
    这次会议的任务是为了扩大战争准备，已经是众所周知的事了。美国国务卿杜勒斯12月10日公开在记者招待会上说，这次会议的使命是要“使北大西洋公约组织活跃起来”，并且明显地暗示，他认为达到这个目的的主要手段是在西欧境内配置火箭武器。动员“大西洋”国家的全部军事力量，制订旨在广泛采用核武器的军事战略计划——这些就是北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议的主要议程。
    但是，美国的算盘并不是完全如意的。它要在其他北大西洋集团国家建立导弹基地和侵夺主权的阴谋，已经遭到许多国家的政界的激烈反对。
    丹麦首相兼外交大臣汉森13日在到达巴黎后说，他将在北大西洋集团政府首脑会议上重申：丹麦反对在它的领土上储存原子核武器及弹道导弹。他还表示，丹麦也反对外国军队留驻。他说，在目前情况下，在和平时期让外国军队驻扎是不合适的。
    法国共和国参议院13日清晨以二百七十四票对十四票的压倒多数通过一项议案，要求政府在没有得到议会授权之前，不得承担有关在法国领土上建立外国军事性基地的任何义务。
    巴黎“法兰西观察家”周刊最近刊载的一篇伦敦通讯指出，尽管英国政府在紧紧追随美国迫使它的北大西洋盟国竭力准备核战争，然而在英国国内，“核中立主义”也正在发展。
    对于从英国基地起飞的美国飞机载着氢弹这件事，英国人感到惊慌。通讯说：“因此，有几个一向不关心外交事务的温和的、保守的工党议员，也在劳埃德向下院发表了（关于美国飞机载有氢弹的）声明以后的几天中倡议‘核和平主义’了。目前欧洲中立化的主张又抬头了。”
    通讯指出，美国政治家凯南最近在英国广播公司发表的关于德国不装备核武器并且从东、西欧撤退美、英、苏三国军队的主张，得到英国人如此普遍的支持，以至于“泰晤士报”也放弃了主张重新武装西德的宣传，而主张使中欧非军事化。
    在西德联邦议院12日上午举行的全体会议上，就社会民主党要求在北大西洋集团政府首脑会议开幕以前进行外交政策辩论的提案进行了表决，执政的基督教民主党依靠在议院中占有的多数席位否决了这个提案。但是社会民主党的提案受到了自由民主党议会党团和一部分德意志党议员的支持。
    社会民主党的提案要求西德政府向北大西洋集团巴黎会议明确提出：西德反对以原子武器装备它的军队，拒绝在发展原子武器方面进行合作；西德拒绝在本国境内建立导弹发射基地；停止原子武器试验；西德政府建议同有关国家举行关于建立“非原子武器地区”的谈判；一切有关国家应当谈判从德国境内撤退它们的驻军问题；北大西洋公约组织的总政策方针应该根据局势的最新发展来进行检查。
