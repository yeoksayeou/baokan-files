The Baltic Sea Should Become a Sea of Peace
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    Peace activists from Finland and other Baltic Sea countries – the Soviet Union, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, and West Germany – as well as representatives from the World Peace Council, at the recent conference on guaranteeing peace in the Baltic Sea region, proposed that the Baltic Sea should not be turned into an area of conflict beneficial to warmongers and that all foreign military bases should be removed from the territory of all countries bordering the Baltic Sea. This proposal to establish a zone of peace in the Baltic Sea not only accords with the interests of the Baltic Sea countries but also with the interests of European and world peace.

    In their plans to create international tension and prepare for a new war, the bellicose imperialist blocs have designated the Baltic Sea region as an important forward base on the northern flank. For a long time, they have been trying to get Finland and Sweden to abandon their neutral policies and to establish military bases in countries such as Norway and Denmark. From mid-September to mid-October this year, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) group, led by the United States, held a large-scale military exercise in the Baltic Sea, creating an atmosphere of tension in an attempt to promote the realization of their plan to turn the Baltic Sea region into a war base. Recently, the United States has been actively planning to build missile bases in West Germany, Denmark, and Norway.

    This activity by the imperialist war bloc, led by the United States, poses an extremely serious danger to the countries of the Baltic Sea region. Once a war launched by the United States breaks out, the entire Baltic Sea will be reduced to a battlefield, and countries that provide bases to the United States will inevitably suffer devastating retaliatory strikes.

    In the face of this grave situation, the Soviet Union, Poland, and the German Democratic Republic, among the Baltic Sea countries, have consistently advocated making the Baltic Sea a sea of peace. The peace-loving people of Finland and Sweden also understand from their practical lives that war only brings them disaster, while peace brings them prosperity. After World War II, Finland actively pursued a policy of peaceful neutrality and developed friendly and cooperative relations with the Soviet Union. As a result, it not only guaranteed its independence and sovereignty but also developed its national economy with the help of the Soviet Union. Sweden, which has long pursued a policy of neutrality, continued to maintain neutrality after World War II and did not join the North Atlantic military bloc. Therefore, its military expenditure was lower, its economic development was more stable, and it also gained a respected position internationally.

    In contrast, Norway and Denmark both accepted the Marshall Plan and joined the North Atlantic military bloc after the war. As a result, their national sovereignty was violated, their military expenditures increased, their finances became increasingly difficult, and they faced the serious danger of being drawn into a new war. This situation has forced broad sections of society in both countries to reconsider their current foreign policies.

    The Conference on Guaranteeing Peace in the Baltic Sea Region marks a new change in the situation in this region. Finland and Sweden are more strongly hoping to maintain neutrality, and the tendency towards neutrality in Denmark and Norway is rising. Even in West Germany, there is a fairly broad stratum that tends towards neutrality. All of this shows that in the situation where the socialist forces are increasingly and obviously surpassing the imperialist forces, the international situation is developing in a direction favorable to world peace. For the Baltic Sea countries, it is only by ensuring that the Baltic Sea is a sea of peace and freeing this region from the chains of the Atlantic military bloc that the security of the countries in this region and the interests of world peace can be served.

　　波罗的海应成为和平之海
　　本报评论员
    芬兰和波罗的海沿岸其他国家苏联、瑞典、挪威、丹麦、波兰、民主德国和西德的和平人士以及世界和平理事会的代表，在最近举行的保证波罗的海地区和平大会上，提出不准把波罗的海变为有利于战争贩子的纠纷地区和清除在波罗的海所有国家境内的外国军事基地的主张。这个在波罗的海建立一个和平区域的主张，不仅符合波罗的海各国的利益，而且也符合欧洲和世界和平的利益。
    好战的帝国主义集团在它们的制造国际紧张局势和准备新战争的计划中，把波罗的海地区列为北翼的重要前进基地。许久以来，它们就力图使芬兰、瑞典放弃中立政策，并在挪威、丹麦等国设置军事基地。今年9月中旬到10月中旬，以美国为首的北大西洋公约组织集团在波罗的海举行了一次大规模的军事演习，制造紧张空气，企图借此促进变波罗的海地区为战争基地的计划的实现。最近，美国又在积极策划在西德、丹麦、挪威国土上建立导弹基地。
    以美国为首的帝国主义战争集团的这种活动，对于波罗的海地区的国家包含着极其严重的危险。一旦美国发动的战争爆发，整个波罗的海将沦为战场，而给美国提供基地的国家就无法避免遭到毁灭性的报复打击。
    在这严重的形势之前，波罗的海各国中苏联、波兰和民主德国是一贯主张使波罗的海成为和平之海的。芬兰和瑞典的爱好和平人民从他们的实际生活中也懂得，战争只有给他们带来灾难，而和平却给他们以繁荣。芬兰在第二次世界大战后，积极推行和平中立政策，与苏联发展友好合作的关系，结果不但保障了自己的独立和主权，并且在苏联帮助下发展了本国的国民经济。长期执行中立政策的瑞典，在第二次世界大战后继续维持中立，没有参加北大西洋军事集团，因此，军费开支较少，经济的发展较为稳定，而且在国际上也赢得了受人尊敬的地位。
    与此相反，挪威和丹麦在战后都接受了马歇尔计划，参加了北大西洋军事集团，结果，国家主权受到侵犯，军费增加，财政日益困难，并且有被卷进新战争的严重危险。这种情况使这两国的广大社会人士不能不重新考虑现行的外交政策。
    保证波罗的海地区和平大会标志着这个地区的形势的新变化。芬兰和瑞典更加强烈地希望保持中立，丹麦和挪威两国的中立倾向正日益抬头，甚至在西德也有相当广泛的阶层倾向中立。这一切都表明，在社会主义力量日益明显地超过帝国主义力量的形势下，国际局势正向有利于世界和平的方向发展。对于波罗的海各国来说，只有保障波罗的海为和平之海，使这个地区摆脱大西洋军事集团的锁链，才符合这个地区国家的安全和世界和平的利益。
