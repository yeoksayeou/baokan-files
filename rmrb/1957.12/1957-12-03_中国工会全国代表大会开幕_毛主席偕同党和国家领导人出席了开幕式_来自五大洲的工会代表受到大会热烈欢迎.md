Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: The Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions opened on the afternoon of December 2nd at the auditorium of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing.

A total of 989 delegates attended the congress, representing more than 16.3 million trade union members nationwide. This number of trade union members has increased by 63.1% compared to the time of the Seventh National Congress of Trade Unions in May 1953.

Central leaders of the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Deng Xiaoping, attended the opening ceremony and were welcomed by all the delegates with stormy and warm applause.

Before the opening ceremony, Xu Zhizhen, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of the Seventh Executive Committee of the Trade Union, proposed a candidate list of 69 people to form the presidium of the congress to all the delegates. All the delegates welcomed this suggestion with warm applause and unanimously approved the list of the presidium of the congress.

Next, the delegates unanimously approved the lists of the Credentials Committee, the Proposals Examination Committee, and the Secretary-General and Deputy Secretaries-General of the congress.

Chairman Mao Zedong and other leaders of the CPC Central Committee met with all members of the presidium after the presidium meeting.

The opening ceremony of the congress was held at 3 p.m. After the band played the national anthem, Executive Chairman Liu Changsheng announced the opening of the congress and delivered the opening speech (see page 3).

He said that the participation of so many countries' trade union delegations in our congress vividly demonstrates the friendship and support of the working class of all countries for the working class of our country. We must work together with the working class of the world for world peace and the cause of human progress. At this moment, all the delegates stood up and warm applause resounded through the venue.

In his report, Lai Ruoyu first outlined the work of the Chinese trade unions in the past four years, then talked about the current tasks of the trade unions, and also talked about the following issues: namely, about adhering to democratic centralism, widely attracting workers to participate in enterprise management; about pushing the socialist competition to a new upsurge; about starting from the overall situation and gradually improving the lives of workers; about strengthening the political, cultural, and technical education of workers, and organizing cultural and sports activities for workers; about strengthening the construction of trade unions and closely connecting with the masses; about strengthening the unity of the international working class and consolidating world peace.

Lai Ruoyu finally demanded that the working class of the whole country must guard against arrogance and impetuosity, work diligently, and with their own exemplary actions, unite the people of the whole country, unite all forces that can be united at home and abroad, work hard, build the country with diligence and thrift, and build our country into a great, prosperous, and strong socialist country as soon as possible.
