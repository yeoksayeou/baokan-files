Dear comrades, dear friends!

On behalf of the Hungarian people, the organized Hungarian workers, and the National Federation of Free Trade Unions of Hungary, I extend warm congratulations to the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions and all attendees.

Dear comrades! The current membership of Chinese trade unions exceeds the entire population of Hungary. We believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people will continue to realize the national industrialization that began after liberation. At the same time, the ranks of workers will continue to expand, and Chinese trade unions will be increasingly consolidated and developed. We draw this conclusion because, from the day of its establishment, the Chinese trade unions have been working hard to continuously improve the living standards and welfare of workers, improve their working conditions, and educate and help them continuously improve their political awareness. The Chinese trade unions unite the power of all working people to complete the plan for developing the national economy and strive to improve the cultural level of the working people, thereby realizing a major task put forward by the Chinese Communist Party—to achieve socialist industrialization.

We, the representatives of the Hungarian trade unions, have only been in China for a few days. Thanks to the kindness of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, we had the opportunity to visit Northeast China, the center of Chinese heavy industry, for a few days. Although the time was short, we gained a deep impression and learned about the experience of Chinese trade unions in closely connecting with the broad masses of workers. We were deeply impressed by the huge projects that the Chinese people and the Chinese working class have built and are building through creative labor. It should be said that all these impressions are very profound, making us sincerely admire and respect the Chinese people.

Dear comrades! I think that the highest organ of power of the organized workers in China—the congress—has every right to let us, the representatives of the Hungarian trade unions, report to you, even if very simply, on what has happened in our Hungary, especially during the days of the counter-revolutionary events last year. Chinese workers can make such a request, even from the point of view that the help they have given to our people is great, significant, and effective.

The events that occurred in Hungary were a long-planned attack by imperialism on socialist forces and on the international workers' movement. Imperialists, whether in the past or now, are trying their best to split the unity of the socialist camp. However, it would be incomplete if we did not talk about the events of the people's enemies attempting to use the mistakes we made in socialist construction to overthrow the Hungarian workers' regime.

Were there mistakes? Yes, there were.

However, the main characteristic of Hungary's development in the twelve years since liberation is not shortcomings, but great achievements. The main means of production, such as land, factories, and mines, are in the hands of the people. Therefore, the relations of production in our country have changed. The working class has become the ruling class and has formed an alliance with the working peasants to jointly control their own power and work together to build a new socialist society. We can say that without the consolidated alliance of the working class and the working peasants, we cannot win, especially cannot consolidate our achievements. All this means that our country has gained true national independence after years of oppression.

However, in the course of our development, we have encountered difficulties and made mistakes. This is not difficult to understand, because the working class in our country had to learn to lead and manage the country's politics and economy in just a few years, which is a complex task. In our work, there were shortcomings that hindered the smooth development of our country and caused dissatisfaction among the broad working class. In the leadership of the party and the state, the cult of personality once dominated. Leaders rarely solicited and valued the opinions of those being led. Under the cult of personality, the wisdom of the party and state leadership was deprived by one person. Of course, the leadership talents of the working people could not be reflected, and new worker cadres could not emerge from the working masses. As a result, we failed to properly combine individual interests and social interests during a certain period. It should be frankly said that although the Hungarian trade unions were participants in our country's great construction achievements, they cannot escape responsibility for the above-mentioned mistakes. In short, there were mistakes. Anyone who understands the logic of class struggle knows that the enemy will not fail to take advantage of the mistakes we have made.

I would also like to mention here that in order to ignite the flames of counter-revolution in Hungary, the imperialists and their agents in Hungary had to adopt new and special tactics. If the counter-revolutionaries openly admitted their purpose and openly stated their attempt to restore the capitalist system, people would not follow them. They had to write the slogan of "socialism" on their counter-revolutionary banner. They said that their purpose was to correct the mistakes made in the process of socialist construction. After a relatively short period of time, that is, twelve years after the establishment of the people's regime in our country, the fact that counter-revolutionaries could not put forward any other slogans besides "continuing to build socialism" powerfully illustrates the great power and incomparable superiority of the socialist system.

I think it is necessary to expose another slander fabricated by the imperialist propaganda machine. They used the counter-revolutionary events in Hungary to launch this slander campaign worldwide. They said that during the period from October to November last year, the entire Hungarian working class rose up against the socialist system and the people's regime. In fact, only a part of the working class, that is, some people who came from the ruling class and had not truly transformed into workers, took advantage of this "opportunity." Others were peasants and young people who had come to the factory not long ago, and they lost their foresight under the influence of enemy propaganda. The entire working class never betrayed socialism, never betrayed the people's regime, that is to say, it did not betray its own cause for a minute. When it recognized the nature and direction of the event, it immediately resolutely took up arms to defend its regime and its achievements.

We have witnessed unprecedented special events: representatives of aristocrats and monopoly capitalists, such as the rumor-mongering experts of Radio Free Europe, the Voice of America, and the Hungarian broadcasts of Washington and London, as they themselves said, to "correct the mistakes made in socialist construction." Comrade, can you imagine? The old Hungarian King Otto and Duke Esterházy actually picked up the rusty daggers of their grandfathers and great-grandfathers to "fight for Hungarian socialism." Can you imagine? The industrial giants of the United States and the Ruhr actually put a lot of effort into "correcting the mistakes of socialism." In the short time they succeeded, they indeed established such a "socialism" that the Hungarian people will never want to see them again. Under the guise of "socialism," they released fascist terrorists, executioners, and lynchers to harm the people.

Glory and thanks forever belong to the fraternal Soviet Union, which promptly helped the Hungarian working class at the request of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government. Glory forever belongs to the Soviet army, which shed blood in order to help the conscious people's forces in the struggle and to quickly end the atrocities of the counter-revolutionaries. Thanks to all the fraternal peoples of the socialist camp, who gave timely and effective assistance to the Hungarian people. Thanks to the entire international workers' movement, the World Federation of Trade Unions, and all its affiliated trade unions, which supported the cause of the Hungarian working people morally and economically, setting a permanent and glorious example of worker solidarity. I would like to take this opportunity to express my warmest thanks to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government, not only because they gave our people valuable material assistance, but also because they gave our people even more significant moral assistance. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party adopted a correct position on the evaluation of the Hungarian events based on the theory of Marxism-Leninism. This fact means an exceptionally great help to the advanced forces of the Hungarian working class and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party in the struggle to defeat the forces of counter-revolution.

Comrades! Under leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Worker's Party and the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, the Hungarian working class and working people have strived to make use of aid from countries in the socialist camp. Now what makes our friends happy and makes our enemies furious is that we are able to report to everyone that most of the wounds left to us by the counter-revolution have been healed within a year. Our political and economic life is developing more healthily than before the counter-revolutionary riots. Industrial production (except for one or two industrial sectors) has reached or surpassed the level before last November. In order to prove this, I think it is necessary to list some statistics. For example, taking the total output value of each industrial sector in August last year as 100, most industrial sectors almost stopped production at the beginning of this year when the counter-revolutionary events just ended, but in the autumn of this year, they approached or even surpassed the production level before October last year. The factories of the metallurgy and machine manufacturing industry system reached 59.1% of the production level of August last year in January this year, and reached 104.4% in September; the factories of the heavy industry department system reached 57.9% of the production level of August last year in January this year, and reached 96.9% in September; the enterprises of the light industry department system reached 70.9% of the production level of August last year in January this year, and reached 103.4% in September. These industries have reached and exceeded the production level of August last year. These figures show that the working class of our country, the engineering and technical intelligentsia of our country have realized the danger that once threatened them in October last year, so they are doing their best to restore the national economy of the country. Although the damage caused by the counter-revolution is serious, our economy has recovered at an extremely fast speed. This fact not only has economic significance, but also proves that the vast majority of workers, peasants and intellectuals in Hungary support the Hungarian Socialist Worker's Party and the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government. It should be said that the losses caused by the counter-revolution (more than 22 billion forints) require us to make up for it through long-term strenuous work. To be honest, the cost of products has not been reduced enough. Our production costs are high, which hinders the necessary improvement of people's welfare and threatens the necessary investment in expanded reproduction. Therefore, we are not satisfied with the achievements we have made after eliminating the counter-revolutionary events, and we must better find some ways to enable our trade unions to more effectively complete the tasks of socialist construction. The primary task of our country's trade unions is: to fully utilize production capacity, save raw materials and power, and organize socialist labor competitions. We have confidence in this. Our country's trade unions should help and promote the increase of national income, and should fight against the tendency of those who, in socialist countries, do not care about production, are detached from production, and simply so-called protect the interests of working people. We need to make the most backward strata of the working class understand that the continuous increase in labor productivity is the most important condition for the continuous improvement of living standards under the socialist system. We will never relax our vigilance against the enemy again. We believe that eradicating those political and cultural poisonous weeds that are still growing in our country and are supported by foreign countries is also one of the most important tasks of our country's trade unions. We should always pay attention to educating the working class of our country in proletarian internationalism, and at the same time, we should constantly fight against bourgeois nationalism.

Dear comrades! We, the Hungarian trade unions, the Hungarian working class, have learned a heavy lesson from domestic and foreign reactionaries. This lesson tells us that trade union organizations can never take a step away from the path pointed out by Marxism-Leninism. This road has been illuminated by the Communist and Workers' parties in all people's democratic countries. Trade union organizations will not deviate from this road only under the leadership of the Communist or Workers' parties.

Comrades, finally, please allow me to tell you that the reports and speeches at your Eighth National Congress have provided us with valuable experience and enlightened our thinking. Please allow me to express that not only this congress, but everything we have seen in China, strengthens our conviction that under the leadership of the well-trained Chinese Communist Party, the great Chinese people, who have written brilliant historical chapters with their great heroic creation, will surely build a new, prosperous, and happy socialist society.

Please allow me to sincerely congratulate this conference on its great success.

    匈牙利自由工会全国联合会主席
    米·绍莫吉致词亲爱的同志们，亲爱的朋友们！
    我谨代表匈牙利人民、代表有组织的匈牙利工人和匈牙利自由工会全国联合会向中国工会第八次全国代表大会和全体与会者致以热烈的祝贺。
    亲爱的同志们！中国工会目前的会员人数已超过匈牙利全国的人口。我们相信：中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，将继续实现从解放后就开始的国家工业化，同时，工人的队伍将不断扩大，中国工会将日益巩固和发展。我们所以得出这一结论，是因为中国工会从成立的第一天起，就一直全力为不断提高工人生活福利、改善他们的劳动条件，为教育和帮助他们不断提高政治觉悟而努力；中国工会团结全体劳动人民的力量去完成发展国民经济的计划，努力提高劳动人民的文化水平，从而实现中国共产党提出的一个主要任务——实现社会主义工业化。
    我们，匈牙利工会代表，来到中国仅仅几天。由于中华全国总工会主席团的盛意，我们有机会用几天的时间访问了中国重工业中心东北。虽然时间很短，但是我们还是得到了深刻的印象，了解到中国工会密切联系广大工人群众的经验。中国人民、中国工人阶级用创造性的劳动已经建成的和正在建设的巨大工程，给了我们极深的印象。应该说，所有这些给我们的印象是非常深刻的，使我们衷心地佩服和尊敬中国人民。
    亲爱的同志们！我想，中国有组织的工人的最高权力机关——代表大会完全有权利让我们——匈牙利工会的代表向你们那怕是很简单地报告一下在我们匈牙利究竟发生了什么事情，特别是去年发生反革命事件的日子里的情况。中国工人可以提出这样的要求，即使从他们给予我国人民的帮助是伟大的、显著的而又有效的这一点上来说，他们也可以提出这样的要求。
    在匈牙利发生的事件，是帝国主义蓄意已久的对社会主义力量的进攻，对国际工人运动的进攻。帝国主义者无论过去或现在，都在千方百计地企图分裂社会主义阵营的团结。但是，如果我们不讲人民的敌人企图利用我们在社会主义建设中所犯的错误，达到推翻匈牙利工人政权的目的的事件。则是不全面的。
    有没有错误呢？是有错误的。
    但是，匈牙利在解放以后十二年来发展的主要特征并不是缺点，而是巨大的成就。主要的生产资料，如土地、工厂、矿井都掌握在人民手中。因此我国的生产关系就发生了变化。工人阶级成为统治阶级，并且和劳动农民结成联盟，共同掌握自己的政权，齐心协力建设新的社会主义社会。我们可以说，没有工人阶级和劳动农民的巩固联盟，我们就不能胜利，尤其是不能巩固我们的成就。所有这一切，都意味着我们的国家在多年的被压迫以后，获得了真正的民族独立。
    但是，在我国的发展当中，曾经遇到过困难，也犯过错误。这是不难理解的，因为我国工人阶级当时必须在短短的几年当中学会领导和管理国家的政治和经济，这是一个复杂的任务。在我们的工作中有过缺点，这些缺点阻碍了我国的顺利发展，并且引起了广泛的劳动阶层的不满情绪。在党和国家的领导中，个人崇拜曾经占统治地位。领导者很少征求和重视被领导者的意见。在个人崇拜的情况下，党和国家的领导的智慧都被一个人剥夺了。当然，劳动人民的领导才能就无法体现，新的工人干部就不可能从劳动群众中涌现出来。结果，使我们在一定的时期内没有能够很好地把个人利益和社会利益结合起来。应该坦率地说，匈牙利工会虽然是我国巨大建设成就的参加者，但是，对上述所犯的错误它也不能脱卸责任。总而言之，是有错误的。凡是懂得阶级斗争的逻辑的人，都懂得敌人是不会不利用我们所犯的错误的。
    我在这里还想提一下，帝国主义者和他们在匈牙利的代理人为了在匈牙利燃起反革命的火焰，不得不采用新的特殊的战术。如果反革命分子公开承认自己的目的，公开说出自己的企图——使资本主义制度复辟，人们是不会跟着他们走的。他们不得不在自己的反革命旗子上写上“社会主义”的口号。他们说他们的宗旨是纠正在社会主义建设过程中所犯的错误。在经过比较起来不算长的时间，即在我国人民政权建立了十二年的今天，反革命分子除了提出要“继续建设社会主义”的口号以外，无法提出另外的口号，这一事实，就有力地说明了社会主义制度的巨大力量及其无比的优越性。
    我认为有必要再揭露一项帝国主义宣传机构捏造的诽谤。他们利用匈牙利的反革命事件，在世界范围内展开了这一诽谤宣传。他们说，在去年十月到十一月期间，整个匈牙利工人阶级都起来反对社会主义制度，反对人民政权。事实上，工人阶级中只有一部分人，即出身于统治阶级还没有真正转变为工人的一些人，利用了这个“时机”。另外一些人，是来到工厂不久的农民和青年，他们在敌人的宣传的影响下丧失了远见。整个工人阶级一分钟也没有背叛社会主义、背叛人民政权，就是说，它没有背叛自己的事业。当它认清了事件的性质和方向的时候，立刻就坚决地拿起武器捍卫了自己的政权，捍卫了自己的成就。
    我们亲眼看到了从未有过的特别的事件：贵族和垄断资本家的代表，如“自由欧洲”电台的造谣专家、“美国之音”以及华盛顿和伦敦的匈语广播，正如他们自己所说，为了“纠正在社会主义建设中所犯的错误”而进行了
  “竞赛”。同志们，你们能想像到吗？匈牙利的旧国王奥托陛下和艾思杰勒哈兹大公居然拾起了他们祖父和曾祖父的生锈的匕首去“争取匈牙利的社会主义”。你们能想像得到吗？美国和鲁尔的工业巨头居然为“纠正社会主义的错误”而大费心机。在他们得逞的短时间内，他们确实建立了这样的“社会主义”，以致匈牙利人民永远不愿见到他们了。他们在“社会主义”的幌子下面把法西斯恐怖、刽子手和私刑者放出来残害人民。
    光荣和感谢永远属于兄弟的苏联，它应匈牙利工农革命政府的请求，及时地帮助了匈牙利工人阶级。光荣永远属于苏联军队，它为了在斗争中帮助觉悟的人民的力量，为了迅速结束反革命分子的暴行，而作了流血的牺牲。感谢社会主义阵营一切兄弟人民，他们给予了匈牙利人民以及时的有效的帮助。感谢整个的国际工人运动、世界工会联合会及其所属的一切工会，它们在道义上和经济上支持匈牙利劳动人民的事业，树立了工人团结的永久光辉的榜样。我愿意借此机会向中国共产党中央委员会和中国政府表示最热烈的感谢，这不仅是因为他们给了我们人民贵重的物质援助，而且还因为他们给了我国人民以意义更加重大的道义援助。中国共产党中央委员会在马克思列宁主义的理论基础上，对匈牙利事件的估价上采取了正确的立场。这一事实意味着对匈牙利工人阶级先进力量和匈牙利社会主义工人党在战胜反革命的势力的斗争中的异常伟大的帮助。
    同志们！匈牙利工人阶级和劳动人民在匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的领导下，努力利用了来自社会主义阵营各国的援助。现在使朋友们高兴和使敌人们狂怒的是我们能够向大家报告说，反革命为我们所留下的创伤，在一年之内大部分已经医治好了。我们的政治和经济生活比反革命暴乱前更加健康地发展着。工业生产（除一两个工业部门外）已经达到或超过去年十一月以前的水平。为了证明这一点，我想列举一些统计数字是必要的。例如把去年八月每一个产业部门的生产总值作为一百，那么在反革命事件刚结束的今年年初，绝大多数产业部门几乎都停止生产，但是在今年秋季就接近甚至超过了去年10月前的生产水平。冶金和机器制造工业部系统的工厂，今年1月份达到了去年8月生产水平的59.1％，而9月份就已经达到了104.4％；重工业部系统的工厂今年1月份达到了去年8月生产水平的57.9％，而9月份就已经达到了96.9％，轻工业部系统的企业今年1月份达到了去年8月生产水平的70.9％，而9月份就已经达到了103.4％。这些工业都达到并且超过了去年8月份的生产水平。这些数字说明，我国的工人阶级、我国的工程技术知识界已经认识到了去年10月间曾经威胁着他们的危险，因此正以全力来恢复国家的国民经济。尽管反革命造成的破坏是严重的，可是我国经济仍以极快的速度恢复过来了。这一事实不仅具有经济上的意义，而且证明了匈牙利绝大多数的工人、农民和知识分子是拥护匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的。应当说，反革命所造成的损失（在220亿弗林以上），是需要我们经过长期紧张的劳动才能弥补过来的。应当说老实话，产品的成本降低得不够。我们的生产成本很高，而这就阻碍了人民福利的必要的提高，威胁着必要的扩大再生产的投资。因此，我们并不满足于在消灭反革命事件以后所获得的成就，我们必须更好地找出一些办法，使我们的工会能够更有效地完成社会主义建设的任务。我国工会的首要任务是：充分运用生产能力，节约原材料和动力，组织社会主义劳动竞赛。对于这些，我们有着信心。我国工会应当帮助并促进增加国民收入，应当向那些在社会主义的国家中不管生产、脱离生产而单纯地所谓保护劳动人民利益的倾向作斗争。我们需要使工人阶级中最落后的阶层了解，不断提高劳动生产率是社会主义制度下不断提高生活水平的最重要的条件。我们永远不再放松对敌人的警惕。我们认为，铲除我国目前还在生长并得到国外支持的那些政治的和文化的毒草，也是我国工会的极重要的任务之一。我们应当经常注意，使我国的工人阶级受到无产阶级国际主义的教育，同时经常同资产阶级民族主义作斗争。
    亲爱的同志们！我们匈牙利的工会、匈牙利的工人阶级，已经从国内外反动派那里得到了沉重的教训，这个教训告诉我们，工会组织永远一步也不能离开马克思列宁主义指出的道路。这条道路在所有人民民主国家里已经为共产党和工人党所照亮了。工会组织只有在共产党或工人党的领导下，才不致于离开这条道路。
    同志们，最后请允许我告诉大家，你们第八次全国代表大会上的报告和发言对我们提供了宝贵的经验，启发了我们的思想。请允许我表示，不仅这次代表大会，凡是我们在中国所看到的一切，都加强着我们这样一个信念：在久经锻炼的中国共产党领导下，以自己巨大的英雄创造在历史上写下了光辉史篇的伟大的中国人民，一定能建成新的、富饶的、幸福的社会主义社会。
    请允许我由衷地祝贺这次大会获得巨大的成功。
