Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 9th: On the eve of the NATO government summit, the French public's call against war preparation policies is rising.

A group of prominent figures yesterday issued an appeal to the French public. These people include Émile Kahn, Francisque Gay, Emmanuel d'Astier, Léo Hamon, and Pierre Lebrun.

The appeal stated that some people are now preparing to take measures to equip the military forces of various countries with the latest weapons, and it is unimaginable that the parliament would not debate these issues. The appeal called on the French people to write to their parliamentarians, asking them to demand a debate, express their attitude, and proactively put forward suggestions sufficient to prompt both camps to take measures to ease international tensions.

The Communist Youth League of France called on French youth to unite and prevent the French government from supporting NATO's aggressive warmongering policies. It demanded that young people across the country send delegations, present petitions, and send telegrams to the French government and other heads of government attending the NATO Council meeting, expressing their opposition to war policies.

The Seine Provincial Peace Council called on people who had suffered from German militarism and all patriots, regardless of political views, to unite and send large delegations to petition the French delegation and foreign delegations on the opening day of the NATO meeting, solemnly expressing their opposition to war.

Xinhua News Agency, December 10th: TASS, London, December 9th: The Birmingham Trades Council in Britain, with 150,000 members, demanded the cancellation of American military bases in Britain and an end to the flight of American aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs over Britain. The executive committee of the National Union of Railwaymen of Britain, with 350,000 members, and the Amalgamated Engineering Union of a district in London also demanded an end to these dangerous flights.

Xinhua News Agency, December 10th: TASS, Reykjavik, December 9th: At the initiative of the Icelandic Writers' Association and the Artists' Association, the working people of the Icelandic capital held a conference and march on December 8th, demanding that the US military withdraw from Iceland and that US military bases in Iceland be dismantled.

The famous writers and political commentators, Gudmundsson, chairman of the Icelandic Writers' Association, and the poet Bodvarsson, spoke at the conference.

The conference passed a resolution strongly condemning the government's delay in implementing the parliamentary resolution passed on March 28, 1956, stipulating the amendment of the US military base agreement in order to enable the withdrawal of US troops from Iceland, and demanded that the government immediately take measures to unconditionally implement the parliamentary resolution. The resolution also called on all the people of Iceland to resolutely demand that the government fulfill its promise.

After the meeting, the participants held a march to the building where Icelandic Prime Minister Jonasson lived. Along the way, more and more residents joined the march, holding up signs with slogans such as "Yankees Go Home!" and "Americans Go Home!" The marchers handed the resolution of the Reykjavik Labor People's Congress to the Prime Minister.

　　北大西洋集团首脑会议不祥之兆
    法国公众反对备战的呼声高涨　英国工会要求制止带氢弹美机飞行　冰岛人民催促政府立即送走美军
    新华社巴黎9日电　在北大西洋集团政府首脑会议前夕，法国公众反对备战政策的呼声正在高涨。
    一批著名人士昨天向法国公众发出呼吁书，这些人中间包括埃米尔·堪恩、弗朗西斯·盖、埃马尼埃·达斯迪埃、利奥·阿蒙和皮埃尔·勒布伦。
    呼吁书说，现在有人在准备采取措施用最新式武器来装备各国军事力量，议会如果竟然不对这些问题进行辩论，那是不可想像的。呼吁书号召法国人民写信给议员，请他们要求举行辩论，表明他们的态度，并主动提出足以促使两个阵营采取缓和国际紧张局势措施的建议。
    法兰西共产主义青年联盟号召法国青年团结起来，阻止法国政府支持北大西洋公约组织的侵略性的好战政策。它要求全国各地青年向法国政府和其他参加北大西洋公约组织理事会会议的政府首脑派出代表团、提出请愿书、拍发电报，表示反对战争政策。
    塞纳省和平理事会，号召曾经遭受德国军国主义迫害的人们和一切爱国人士，不分政治见解，团结一致，派出大批代表团，在北大西洋公约组织会议开幕那一天向法国代表团和各外国代表团去请愿，庄严地表示反对战争。
    据新华社10日讯　据塔斯社伦敦9日讯：拥有十五万会员的英国伯明翰工会理事会要求取消美国在英国的军事基地和制止载有氢弹的美国飞机在英国上空飞行。拥有三十五万会员的英国全国铁路工人工会执行委员会和伦敦一个区的混合机械工人工会也要求停止这种危险的飞行。
    据新华社10日讯　据塔斯社雷克雅未克9日讯：根据冰岛作家协会和艺术工作者协会的倡议，冰岛首都劳动人民12月8日举行大会和游行，要求美军撤离冰岛和撤除美国在冰岛的军事基地。
    著名的作家和政论家、冰岛作家协会主席格德门森、诗人波德瓦逊等人在大会上讲了话。
    大会通过一项决议，坚决谴责政府拖延执行议会在1956年3月28日通过的规定修改美国军事基地协定，以便使美军撤离冰岛的决议，要求政府立刻采取措施，无条件地执行议会决议。决议并号召冰岛全体人民坚决要求政府实现诺言。
    会后与会者举行游行，前往冰岛总理荣纳逊居住的大厦。一路上有越来越多的居民参加游行行列，他们高举上面写着“美军滚出去！”“美国人回家去！”的标语牌。游行者把雷克雅未克劳动人民大会的决议书交给了总理。
