    A Clean New Year
    Beijing to Launch Sanitary Blitz Campaign

    (Our Newspaper) Beijing – Beijing will launch a winter "Eliminate the Four Pests and Promote Hygiene" campaign blitz week.
    Beijing's winter "Eliminate the Four Pests and Promote Hygiene" campaign has already begun throughout the city and has achieved some results. However, the development of the campaign has not been balanced enough, particularly in failing to seize the opportunity to eliminate the remaining overwintering mosquitoes and flies. In order to push the movement to a city-wide climax where every household knows about it and everyone participates, the Municipal Patriotic Health Campaign Committee has decided to launch a large-scale blitz week from the 22nd to the 29th (24th to 31st in suburban areas).
    Through the blitz week's publicity, the requirements are, on the one hand, to further clarify the significance of the "Eliminate the Four Pests and Promote Hygiene" campaign, laying a solid ideological foundation for the broad masses; on the other hand, based on the situation of the previous stage of the campaign, to use typical examples for in-depth publicity, mobilize the masses to vigorously eliminate overwintering mosquitoes and flies, while actively killing rats and sparrows, and doing a good job of personal and environmental hygiene, to have a clean New Year, creating a city-wide climax where everyone participates in eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene.

    干干净净过新年
    北京市将开展卫生突击宣传
    本报讯  北京市将开展冬季“除四害、讲卫生”运动突击周。
    北京市冬季“除四害、讲卫生”运动已经在全市范围内开展起来，并且取得了一定的成绩。但是，运动发展还不够平衡，特别是没有抓紧消灭过冬的残存蚊蝇。为了把运动推向家喻户晓、人人动手的全市性的高潮，市爱国卫生运动委员会决定：从22日到29日（郊区是24日到31日）在全市开展一个大规模的突击周。
    通过突击周的宣传，要求一方面进一步阐明“除四害、讲卫生”运动的意义，给广大群众打下坚实的思想基础；另一方面根据前一阶段运动的情况，运用典型事例，深入宣传，动员群众大力消灭过冬蚊蝇，同时积极灭鼠，灭雀，搞好个人卫生和环境卫生，干干净净过新年，在全市造成人人动手除四害、讲卫生的高潮。
