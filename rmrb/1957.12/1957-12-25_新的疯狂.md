Notes

    A New Madness
    According to the "Washington Post," the report of the U.S. "Gaither Committee" advocates launching a "preventive war" as soon as possible, on the grounds that the side that attacks first always has an advantage in a modern atomic war.
    The "New York Post" described this advocacy in the "Gaither Report" as a "new madness" that makes "the stupidity of returning to the caveman era" seem "pale in comparison." This is a relatively clear-headed view. The emergence of intercontinental missiles has made it impossible for the United States to be a safe rear area in wartime as it was in the past; if the madmen in Washington dare to launch a new war, it is certain that the future of the United States can only be "returning to the caveman era."

    新的疯狂
    据“华盛顿邮报”透露，美国“盖瑟委员会”的报告主张赶紧发动一场“预防性战争”，理由是在现代原子战争中首先进攻的一方总是占便宜的。
    “纽约邮报”把“盖瑟报告”中的这种主张说成是使“那种要回到穴居时代去的蠢事”都显得“黯然失色”的“新的疯狂”。这倒是比较清醒的看法。洲际导弹的出现已使美国再也不能像过去那样在战争中成为一个安全的后方；如果华盛顿的狂人敢于发动一场新的战争，肯定地说美国的前途只能是“回到穴居时代去”。
