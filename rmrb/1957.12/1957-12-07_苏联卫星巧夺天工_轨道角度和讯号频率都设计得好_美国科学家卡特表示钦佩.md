Xinhua News Agency, 6th: San Francisco Dispatch: Finla Carter, Director of the Stanford Research Institute in the United States, recently said that the angle of the satellite orbit chosen by the Soviets when launching artificial satellites was an ingenious feat, because this angle allows the satellite to pass over all inhabited areas of the Earth.

He said that the frequency of the radio signals emitted by the Soviet satellites was designed perfectly, because amateur listeners all over the world can receive it without spending much money. Conversely, the signal frequency of the American pre-designed satellite is very high, and only special receivers can receive it.

The American scientist said: After the Soviet satellite was launched, some people in the United States accused the Soviet Union of deliberately preventing others from knowing how to track the satellite. He said that this is completely untrue. He pointed out that as early as June, a Soviet amateur radio publication published an article "describing in detail the function of the satellite, the method of observing the satellite, the nature of the signal and other materials." The United States translated this article into English four months later.

He said that this proves that "we are pathetically slow to act, or we are not paying enough attention to what others are doing, or both."

　　苏联卫星巧夺天工
　　轨道角度和讯号频率都设计得好
　　美国科学家卡特表示钦佩
    新华社6日讯　旧金山消息：美国史坦福研究院主任芬莱·卡特最近说，苏联人在放射人造卫星时所选择的卫星轨道角度是一件巧夺天工的事，因为这个角度恰好使卫星行经地球上所有有人居住的地区的上空。
    他说，苏联卫星上所发出的无线电讯号的频率设计得恰到好处，因为全世界的业余收听者都可以不花什么钱就能够收到它。相反的，美国预先设计的卫星信号频率很高，只有使用特制的收听机才能收到。
    这位美国科学家说：当苏联卫星发射以后，美
            国曾经有人指责苏联故意不让别人知道追踪卫星的方法。他说，这完全与事实不符。他指出，早在6月份，苏联的一个业余无线电刊物就发表了一篇文章，“详细地描写卫星的作用、观察卫星的方法、信号的性质以及其他各种材料”。隔了四个月美国才把这篇文章译成英文。
    他说，这件事倒是证明“我们是可悲地行动缓慢，要不然就是没有足够注意别人在做些什么，再不然是两者兼备”。
