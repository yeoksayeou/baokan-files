    Beside the Rain Flower Terrace of Heroes
    One Sunday morning, a labor army, holding high the red flag of the "Nanjing University Labor Brigade," marched in great force towards the Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Yuhuatai District. They were going to help the farmers build water conservancy projects. In less than half a day, students from the Departments of Geography, Meteorology, and History had basically completed their daily quotas. But everyone was not satisfied with this. In the afternoon, students from the Meteorology and Geography Departments extended their marching route, and students from the History Department opened up a new construction site. "Digging one more inch is advancing one more inch towards socialism," cheers of labor could be heard everywhere.
    Soon, at the foot of the heroic Rain Flower Terrace, a two-li-long irrigation and drainage canal will appear. This is the crystallization of the labor of Nanjing University students.
    After the completion of the project, it will not only save the agricultural cooperative three thousand workdays, but also create 20,000 yuan of wealth for the agricultural cooperative every year, and reclaim 50 mu of wasteland and drain 80 mu of waterlogged land. What a meaningful activity this is! (Qing Xuexi)

    英雄的雨花台边
    一个星期天的清晨，一支高举着“南京大学劳动大队”红旗的劳动大军，浩浩荡荡向雨花台区光明农业生产合作社进发。他们去帮助农民兴修水利。地理、气象、历史三系学生不到半天，就基本上完成了全日指标。可是大家并不以此为满足。下午，气象、地理两系同学延长了进军路线，历史系同学开辟了新工地。“多挖一寸，就是向社会主义前进一寸”，到处都是劳动的欢呼声。
    不久，在英雄的雨花台坡下，将出现一条长二华里的灌溉排水渠。这是南京大学同学劳动的结晶。
    工程完成后，不仅可以为农业社节省三千个劳动日，还可每年为农业社创造二万元的财富，并开垦荒地五十亩，排涝八十亩。这是一项多么有意义的活动啊！　（庆学熙）
