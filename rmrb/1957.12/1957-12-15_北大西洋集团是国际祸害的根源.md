　　The North Atlantic Group is the Source of International Calamities
　　Jiang Ruixi
　　The North Atlantic Group has encountered an unprecedentedly serious crisis in its ninth year of establishment. Due to the fundamental changes in the balance of power between the two camps, the imperialist countries' "position of strength" policy has gone bankrupt, and the strategic foundation of the Atlantic aggressive bloc has collapsed. However, the organizers of this group still intend to regroup their forces to reverse the decline. The upcoming summit of the North Atlantic Group countries in Paris will discuss how to cope with the external and internal crises of the group under the new situation, and plan to strengthen the atomic arms race.
　　At this time, it is beneficial to review the nature of the North Atlantic Group and its role in international relations.
　　The North Atlantic Group was from the beginning a military alliance aimed at preparing for aggressive war, and is one of the main sources of international tension. It is the most important of a series of military blocs formed by the United States after the war. It brings together all the major countries in the capitalist world and has become the core force of the imperialist camp.
　　The military aggressive nature of this group is no longer a secret. The successive supreme commanders of the North Atlantic Group, the American generals, from Eisenhower, Ridgway, Gruenther to Norstad, have unreservedly talked about waging war against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in public speeches. In 1954, the North Atlantic Group countries rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to join the group, further exposing the lie that the North Atlantic Group is a "defensive alliance" for maintaining European peace.
　　Facts over the past eight years have proved that the existence and activities of this group are completely contrary to the peaceful aspirations and fundamental interests of the people of all countries. It undermines the United Nations' ideal of international cooperation, seriously threatens world peace and international security, and brings heavy military expenditure burdens and other adverse consequences to the people of all countries.
　　Under the deceptive slogan of "resisting armed attack," the North Atlantic Group has launched a large-scale arms race and developed an aggressive military force targeting socialist countries. As a result of large-scale military expansion and war preparation, the military expenditure of North Atlantic countries has increased dramatically. Since the establishment of this group in 1949, member states have spent more than 370 billion U.S. dollars on expanding armaments in seven years. In 1956 alone, the total military expenditure of all countries amounted to 56.1 billion U.S. dollars, three times that of 1949. The total military expenditure of the North Atlantic Group's Western European member states reached more than 12.66 billion U.S. dollars in 1956, while it was only 4.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1949. Taking the United Kingdom as an example, every Briton has to bear more than 30 pounds of military expenditure per year on average. The crazy arms expansion movement has brought serious damage to the economies of various countries, which is a fact that even some official spokespersons of these countries have to admit.
　　At present, the North Atlantic Group's arms movement is shifting from conventional armaments to a missile and nuclear armaments basis. This requires countries to spend more financial resources. The U.S. government has decided to further increase military expenditure. At the same time, in accordance with the strategic policy of preparing for nuclear war, the United States has transported atomic weapons to bases in Western European member states for storage, and is planning to equip the troops of West Germany and other countries of the North Atlantic Group with atomic weapons. The work of training the armed forces of member states for atomic warfare is already underway. According to recent revelations, American aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs are constantly flying over Western European countries. These activities greatly increase the danger of atomic war.
　　In the North Atlantic Group's aggressive deployment, the network of bases spread across Western Europe and the Mediterranean region occupies an important position. According to statistics, at the beginning of this year, the North Atlantic Group had a total of 174 air force bases, which are expected to increase to 250 by the end of next year. A large part of these bases are used by the U.S. armed forces. According to U.S. Secretary of State Dulles himself, the purpose of these bases is to prepare to "strike the heartland of Russia." The establishment and continuous expansion of this completely hostile military base network has greatly deteriorated relations between the East and the West, and is an important factor in creating international tension.
　　In the United States and its allies' plan to expand the "strength" of the North Atlantic Group and prepare for aggressive war, the revival of German militarism occupies a very important position. After the war, the United States and its British and French partners systematically divided Germany, supported revanchist and militarist forces in West Germany, and tried to rebuild the West German army. The approval of the Paris Accords in the first half of 1955 brought West Germany's rearmament into the open. After this, West Germany was officially drawn into the North Atlantic Group. West Germany's remilitarization and participation in the North Atlantic Group makes it impossible to resolve the German question along peaceful and democratic paths, and poses an increasing threat to European peace and security. The appointment of the famous Nazi general and executioner of the French people, Speidel, as the commander of the North Atlantic Group's Central European ground forces is a concrete symbol of this threat.
　　The North Atlantic Group is not only a planner of atomic "hot war", but also a hotbed of "cold war" and subversive activities. The United States and its main Atlantic partners constantly send spies and secret agents to the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries to carry out sabotage activities. All kinds of espionage and sabotage centers are spread throughout West Germany and other lands adjacent to people's democratic countries. The members of the North Atlantic Group openly clamor to interfere in the internal affairs of the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, and constantly carry out various conspiracies. This was particularly evident after the counter-revolutionary incident in Hungary last year. The United States even drew up a plan with Hungarian exiled counter-revolutionary leaders to establish a counter-revolutionary government in Hungary, including having Hungary join the North Atlantic Group after the counter-revolutionaries seized power, and establishing North Atlantic Group air force bases on Hungarian territory. During the North Atlantic Group Council meeting in December last year, the situation in Hungary and the plans of the West were discussed, and support for counter-revolutionaries in Eastern European countries to overthrow the people's democratic regimes was openly expressed in the communique.
　　The composition and activities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization show that it is the base camp of contemporary colonialism. This group includes almost all colonial countries. It carries out the task of maintaining colonial interests and suppressing national independence movements on the international stage. In the 1956 Suez incident, Britain and France directly launched an aggression against Egypt. Although the United States did not openly participate in the attack on Egypt, it exerted political and economic pressure on Egypt, colluding with Britain and France in an attempt to force Egypt to accept the "international control" plan for the canal. At the same time, the United States also refused to take practical sanctions against the British and French aggressors. France's colonial war in Algeria also receives support from the North Atlantic Group. A recent example is: when Indonesia launched a nationwide struggle against Dutch colonialism on the issue of recovering West Irian, the North Atlantic Group convened a meeting of the Permanent Representatives Council to discuss the so-called "situation in Indonesia," expressed "sympathy" for the Netherlands, and decided to hand over the Netherlands' request for North Atlantic Group "support" to various governments. The "North Atlantic" alliance even intervened in Southeast Asian affairs, grossly interfering in the internal affairs of the independent sovereign state of Indonesia. This clearly exposes the colonialist nature of this alliance.
　　The North Atlantic Group frequently conducts large-scale military exercises, the purpose of which, in addition to preparing for war and creating a tense atmosphere, is also to intimidate the people in the regions striving for independence. This autumn, just as the people of Syria, who were defending their independence, launched a struggle against imperialist interference, the Southern European Command of the North Atlantic Group conducted joint exercises from northern Italy to Turkey from September 24 to 28, and the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps conducted the largest post-war concentration in the Mediterranean. U.S. news agencies did not conceal that this exercise was precisely to intimidate Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
　　On the one hand, stepping up war preparations and creating a tense atmosphere, and on the other hand, obstructing any measures to ease international tensions and promote peace, are two inseparable aspects of the "North Atlantic policy." The North Atlantic Group has rejected all the Soviet Union's peace initiatives. It is precisely because of the obstructionist activities of the main countries of the North Atlantic Group, headed by the United States, that top priority issues related to world peace and the security of the people of all countries, such as disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, the conclusion of a European collective peace treaty, and great power talks to resolve international disputes, have remained unresolved and unable to make progress.
　　The North Atlantic Group is not only an alliance of the world's main reactionary forces, but also a tool of the most ferocious enemy of peace - U.S. imperialism. The U.S. ruling group uses the North Atlantic Group on the one hand to create and maintain a hostile atmosphere towards socialist countries, prepare for aggression against these countries, and carry out sabotage activities, and on the other hand to lasso Western European countries, forcing them to accept U.S. "leadership" and serve U.S. strategic plans. This situation makes this group particularly dangerous.
　　Recently, the U.S. "policy of strength" suffered a decisive and disastrous defeat. The powerful forces of the world maintaining peace, with the socialist camp as the main body, fully demonstrated themselves around the world. The panic-stricken U.S. ruling group is eager to prevent the disintegration of the North Atlantic Group and to force this group to give a hand militarily. Together with Britain, they put forward the slogan of "mutual dependence," attempting to make Western European allies hand over more sovereignty, further depend on the United States, and become the advanced outposts of the United States. The plans that the United States will propose at the North Atlantic Treaty summit, which have already been revealed, include the establishment of a missile base network on the territories of the North Atlantic Group's Western European countries, the establishment of a unified atomic weapons reserve in Western Europe, the allocation of weapons production tasks among member states, and the establishment of central forces, etc. The result of this set of goods that the United States is trying to peddle to its partners by taking advantage of the strategic crisis of the North Atlantic Group and the artificial "sense of urgency" can only be to further drag the Western European allies down and make them martyrs of the U.S. "policy of strength."
　　The North Atlantic Group is one of the ugliest and most dangerous products in the history of post-war international relations. Before it is finally swept away by the iron broom of history, this group will continue to play a role in harming peace. But the fate of the world is already firmly in the hands of the forces of peace and socialism. In the new era when the power of socialism is high above dying imperialism, the contradictions and weaknesses of this anti-people and anti-peace gang are destined to develop only at an accelerated pace. No matter how its "suzerain" and "allies" struggle, its declining future is certain.

　　北大西洋集团是国际祸害的根源
　　江瑞熙
  　北大西洋集团在它成立的第九个年头中遭到了空前严重的危机。由于两大阵营力量对比的根本变化，帝国主义国家“实力地位”政策已经破产，大西洋侵略集团的战略基础垮台了。但是这个集团的组织者还打算重新集合力量来挽回颓势。即将在巴黎开幕的北大西洋集团国家首脑会议要讨论的，就是如何应付新形势下集团外部和内部的危机，并且策划加强原子军备竞赛问题。
    在这个时候，回顾一下北大西洋集团的性质和它在国际关系中所起的作用，是有好处的。
    北大西洋集团从开始就是一个以准备侵略战争为目的的军事联盟，并且是国际紧张局势的主要根源之一。它是美国在战后组成的一系列军事集团中最主要的一个。它集合了资本主义世界所有主要的国家，成为帝国主义阵营的核心力量。
    关于这个集团的军事侵略性质，早已不是什么秘密了。北大西洋集团历任最高统帅的美国将军，从艾森豪威尔、李奇微、格仑瑟到诺斯塔德，都毫不掩饰地在公开发言中谈论对苏联和其他社会主义国家进行战争。1954年北大西洋集团国家拒绝了苏联关于参加这个集团的建议，更戳穿了所谓北大西洋集团是维护欧洲和平的“防御联盟”的鬼话。
    八年多的事实证明，这个集团的存在和它的活动，是完全违反各国人民的和平愿望和基本利益的。它使联合国关于国际合作的理想遭到破坏，使世界和平和国际安全遭到严重的威胁，并为各国人民带来沉重的军费负担和其他恶劣的后果。
    在“抵抗武装攻击”的骗人口号下，北大西洋集团展开了大规模的军备竞赛，发展针对着社会主义国家的侵略性军事力量。大规模扩军备战的结果，北大西洋国家的军费有了惊人的增加。从1949年这个集团成立以来，在七年中全体成员国已经在扩张军备方面耗费了三千七百多亿美元。仅仅1956一年，各国军费总和就高达五百六十一亿美元，等于1949年的三倍。北大西洋集团西欧各成员国的军费总和1956年达到一百二十六点六亿多美元，而1949年只有四十八亿美元。以英国为例，平均每一个英国人一年就要负担超过三十英镑的军费。疯狂的扩军运动给各国经济带来严重损害，这已经是连这些国家的一些官方发言人也不得不承认的事实。
    目前北大西洋集团的军备运动正在由常规军备转到导弹和核军备的基础上。这要求各国支出更多的财力。美国政府已经决定进一步增加军费。同时，按照准备核战争的战略方针，美国已经把原子武器运到西欧成员国的基地上储存，并且正在策划以原子武器来装备西德和北大西洋集团其他国家的部队。对各成员国武装部队进行原子战争的训练的工作已经在进行。根据最近透露的情况，携带氢弹的美国飞机不断在西欧各国上空飞行。这些活动大大增加了原子战争的危险。
    在北大西洋集团的侵略部署中，遍布西欧和地中海地区的基地网占有重要的地位。据统计，在今年年初，北大西洋集团一共有一百七十四个空军基地，预计到明年年底将要增加到二百五十个。这些基地中很大一部分归美国武装部队使用。按照美国国务卿杜勒斯自己的说法，这些基地的目的是要准备着“给俄国的腹地以打击”。这种完全敌对性的军事基地网的建立和不断扩充，大大恶化东西方之间的关系，是造成国际紧张局势的一个重要因素。
    在美国及其盟国在扩展北大西洋集团的“实力”和准备侵略战争的计划中，复活德国军国主义处于一个非常重要的地位。战后美国和英法伙伴有计划地分裂德国，在德国西部扶植复仇主义和军国主义的势力，并且想办法重建西德军队。1955年上半年巴黎协定的批准使西德的重新武装进入了公开的阶段。在这以后，西德就被正式拉进北大西洋集团。西德的重新军国主义化和参加北大西洋集团，使得沿着和平民主的途径解决德国问题成为不可能，并且造成对欧洲和平和安全的日益增长的威胁。著名的纳粹将军、屠杀法国人民的刽子手斯派达尔被任命为北大西洋集团中欧地面部队司令，是这种威胁的一个具体象征。
    北大西洋集团不但是原子“热战”的策划者，而且是“冷战”和颠覆活动的策源地。美国及其大西洋主要伙伴不断派遣间谍、特务到苏联和人民民主国家进行破坏活动。各色各样的间谍破坏中心遍布在西德和其他毗邻人民民主国家的土地上。北大西洋集团的成员们公开叫嚷要干涉苏联和人民民主国家的内政，并且不断进行着各种阴谋活动。这一点在去年匈牙利反革命事件发生以后表现得特别明显。美国当时甚至已同匈牙利流亡国外的反革命头子拟订了在匈牙利成立反革命政府的计划，其中包括在反革命夺得政权后使匈牙利加入北大西洋集团，并且在匈牙利领土上建立北大西洋集团的空军基地。去年12月间北大西洋集团理事会会议讨论了匈牙利局势和西方的计划，并且在公报里公开表示支持东欧各国反革命分子推翻人民民主政权。
    北大西洋公约组织的构成及其活动说明它是当代殖民主义的大本营。这个集团包括了差不多全部殖民国家。它在国际舞台上执行着维护殖民利益和镇压民族独立运动的任务。1956年的苏伊士事件中，英法直接发动了对埃及的侵略。美国虽然没有公开参加对埃及的进攻，但是对埃及施加了政治的和经济的压力，勾结英法一起企图压迫埃及接受运河的“国际管制”计划。同时美国还拒绝对英法侵略者采取实际的制裁措施。法国对阿尔及利亚的殖民战争也从北大西洋集团得到支持。最近的一次事例是：当印度尼西亚在收回西伊里安问题上对荷兰殖民主义者展开全国性斗争时，北大西洋集团召开了常任代表理事会会议，讨论所谓“印度尼西亚的局势”，对荷兰表示了“同情”，并且决定把荷兰要求北大西洋集团“声援”的请求交给各国政府。“北大西洋”的联盟居然插手到东南亚事务中，对独立的主权国家印度尼西亚的内政进行粗暴的干涉。这再也明显不过地暴露了这个联盟的殖民主义本质。
    北大西洋集团经常举行大规模的军事演习，其目的除了准备战争和制造紧张气氛以外，也是为了对争取独立的地区的人民进行恫吓。今年秋天，正当维护独立的叙利亚人民展开反对帝国主义干涉的斗争的时候，北大西洋集团南欧司令部从9月24日到28日从意大利北部到土耳其举行了联合演习，美国海军和海军陆战队进行了战后在地中海上最大一次集结。美国通讯社并不讳言，这一个演习正是为了威吓叙利亚和其他中东国家。
    一方面是加紧备战和制造紧张空气，另一方面是阻挠任何缓和国际紧张局势和促进和平的措施，这是“北大西洋政策”的不可分割的两个方面。北大西洋集团拒绝了苏联的一切和平倡议。正是由于以美国为首的北大西洋集团主要国家这种阻挠活动，像裁军、禁止原子武器、缔结欧洲集体和平公约和大国会谈解决国际争端这些关系到世界和平和各国人民安全的头等重要的问题，一直悬而未决，不能获得进展。
    北大西洋集团不仅是世界主要反动力量的联盟，而且是和平的最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义政策的工具。美国统治集团利用北大西洋集团一方面制造和维持对社会主义国家的敌对气氛，准备对这些国家的侵略和进行破坏活动，另方面给西欧国家套上套索，强使它们接受美国的“领导”，为美国的战略计划服务。这种情况使得这个集团具有特别危险的性质。
    最近，美国“实力政策”遭到决定性的惨败，以社会主义阵营为主体的世界维护和平的强大力量在全世界充分显示出来，惊惶失措的美国统治集团急于要防止北大西洋集团的瓦解并且要迫使这个集团在军事上加一把力，伙同英国提出了“互相依赖”的口号，企图使西欧盟国交出更多的主权，进一步依赖美国，成为美国的前哨据点。已经透露的美国将在北大西洋公约政府首脑会议上提出的计划，包括在北大西洋集团的西欧各国领土上设立导弹基地网、在西欧建立统一的原子武器储备、在成员国之间分配武器生产任务、建立中央部队等等。美国企图利用北大西洋集团的战略危机和人为的“紧急感”来向它的伙伴兜售的这一套货色，其结果只能是把西欧盟国进一步拉下水，成为美国“实力政策”的殉葬者。
    北大西洋集团是战后国际关系史中最丑恶最凶险的产物之一。在它最后被历史的铁扫帚扫除出去以前，这个集团还将继续起危害和平的作用。但是世界的命运已经牢牢地掌握在和平和社会主义力量的手中。在社会主义的威力高高凌驾于垂死的帝国主义的新时代，这个反人民、反和平的黑帮的矛盾和弱点注定了只有加速地发展。不管它的“盟主”和“盟友”们如何挣扎，它的没落的前途是肯定的。
