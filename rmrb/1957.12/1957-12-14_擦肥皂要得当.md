　　Properly Using Soap is Important
　　Huashan
    Why does a little soap make clothes cleaner? How can we save soap? These questions are worth exploring. Generally speaking, dirt on clothing is nothing more than grease and dust. Dust attached to clothes will fall off with just rinsing with water; while grease must be rubbed gently with some soap to be cleaned. What role does soap play here?
    Ordinary soap is made by heating fats and oils with a caustic soda solution, going through a decomposition process. We can roughly divide a soap molecule into two parts. One part consists of two oxygen atoms, one carbon atom, and one sodium atom. This part is very attracted to water, which is why soap easily dissolves in water. The other part consists of twelve or more carbon atoms and twenty-five or more hydrogen atoms. This part hates water but loves grease. We can use a simple diagram to represent a soap molecule:
    The circular part is the part that likes to be close to water, we call it the head; the part below is the part that likes to be close to oil, we call it the tail. The ability of soap to remove dirt lies entirely in this head and tail. When we wash clothes, we always soak the clothes in water first, and then apply soap. At this time, the soap will dissolve in the water. The tails of these dissolved soap molecules will stick firmly to the grease, while their heads remain in the water. It can be seen that the soap molecule tightly pulls together the immiscible oil and water, acting as a bridge. At this time, as long as you use a little force to rub thoroughly, those oil stains that have been surrounded by soap will fall into the water, because their exteriors are covered with a soap protective coat. After rinsing, the clothes will be completely clean.
    When washing clothes, it is best to wash them with clean water once or twice first, to wash away the dust that can be washed away with water, and then apply soap. This will not only wash very cleanly, but also save soap. When we just apply some soap to the clothes, we often feel that there is no or very little foam, because all the soap applied has gone to surround the grease. After the grease has been completely surrounded, if you apply soap again, a lot of foam will be produced. This foam is superfluous for dirty clothes. Some people think that the more foam the better, so they apply as much soap as possible, which is actually a waste.
    Whether soap is used sparingly or not is also related to the water used for washing clothes. Washing with hot water is better than with cold water, because soap dissolves more and faster in hot water, making washing easier and cleaner. Well water contains a lot of minerals such as calcium and magnesium. These calcium and magnesium compounds easily combine with dissolved soap to form new substances. These new substances are difficult to dissolve in water, so some of the soap has lost its effect before it has had time to surround the grease on the clothes. However, this loss can be avoided. Just add some clarified lime water and a little soda ash to the well water, and the calcium and magnesium compounds in the water will combine with the lime water to form a muddy precipitate. Filter out the precipitate, and the remaining water is suitable for use.
    Using water properly, applying soap appropriately, and rubbing a little, the dust and general grease on the clothes can be washed clean. There is no need to brush or beat the clothes with a stick at all. Brushing and beating with force is not only a waste of effort, but also easily damages the clothes.

### 擦肥皂要得当

　　擦肥皂要得当
　　华山
    为什么擦点肥皂衣服就洗得干净？怎样才能节省肥皂？这些问题很有讲究。一般说来，衣物的污秽不外是油渍与尘土。附在衣服上的尘土，只要用水冲洗，即会脱落；而油渍，必须擦一点肥皂，轻轻地加以揉搓，才会洗净。肥皂在这里究竟起了什么作用呢？
    一般的肥皂，是用油脂与苛性钠液煮热，经过分解作用而制成的。我们可以粗略地把肥皂分子分为两部分，一部分是由二个氧原子，一个碳原子，一个钠原子所组成。这部分很喜欢与水亲近，就是因为有了它，肥皂才容易溶解于水。另一部分是由十二个以上的碳原子和二十五个以上的氢原子所组成的。这部分很讨厌水，但很喜欢与油亲近。我们用一个简单的图形来表示肥皂分子：
    圆形部分即是喜欢与水亲近的部分，我们叫它为头部；下面的部分是喜欢与油亲近的部分，我们叫它为尾巴。肥皂之所以有去垢作用，全在这一头一尾。当我们洗衣物时，总是先把衣物浸在水中，然后涂肥皂，这时肥皂即会溶解于水。这些已经溶解了的肥皂分子的尾巴即会牢牢地粘在油渍上，而它的头部仍然伸在水中。在此可以看出，肥皂分子把互不相溶的油与水紧紧地拉在一起了，起了桥梁作用。这时，只要稍用一点力气充分地加以揉搓，那些已被肥皂包围的油渍即会落在水中，因为它们的外部已穿了一件肥皂保护衣。再经过冲洗，衣服即可完全干净了。
    洗衣服，最好先用清水洗一两遍，把那些可以用水洗掉的尘土洗去，然后再擦抹肥皂。这样，不但洗得很干净，同时也省肥皂。衣服上刚抹了一些肥皂的时候，我们往往感到没有或很少有泡沫，这是因为所擦的肥皂全去包围油渍了。等到油渍已被全部包围完毕后，如再擦肥皂，即会产生大量泡沫。这些泡沫，对脏衣服来说，已经是多余的东西。有些人以为泡沫愈多愈好，就尽量擦肥皂，其实是一种浪费。
    肥皂用得费不费，与洗衣服用的水也有关系。用热水洗比用冷水好，因为肥皂在热水中溶解得又多又快，洗起来省劲又干净。井水含的钙、镁等矿物质很多，这些钙镁化合物很容易同已溶的肥皂化合成新的东西。这些新东西很难溶于水，因此有一部分肥皂还没有来得及去包围衣服上的油渍就已失去作用。不过这种损失是可以避免的。只要在井水中滴入一些澄清的石灰水，和加上一点纯碱，水中的钙镁化合物即会与石灰水结成泥状的沉淀物。把沉淀物滤掉，剩下的水就合用了。
    用水得宜，擦皂得当，稍加搓洗，衣物上的尘土和一般油渍，就可洗涤干净，根本用不着用刷子刷或用棒子捶打衣服。用劲刷和捶打，不但白费劲，而且还容易损坏衣服。
