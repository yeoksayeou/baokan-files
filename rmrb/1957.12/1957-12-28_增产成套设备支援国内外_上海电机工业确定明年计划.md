Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 27th: After trial-manufacturing and producing more than 60 types of complete sets of machinery and equipment during the First Five-Year Plan period, Shanghai's local electrical machinery industry will, in the Second Five-Year Plan period, trial-manufacture and produce more complete sets of equipment, in order to fully utilize its characteristics such as long history, many veteran technicians, relatively rich technical experience, and convenient production cooperation relationships. Next year, they will begin manufacturing complete sets of equipment for chemical fertilizer plants, equipment for small-scale iron and steel complexes including ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling, equipment for the city's expanded gas plant, and complete sets of equipment to support light industrial factories such as plastics, stationery, and enamelware in fraternal countries.
