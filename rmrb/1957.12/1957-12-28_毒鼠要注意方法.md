It is common for people to oversimplify rat poisoning work, assuming that simply putting poison in food and throwing it where rats appear will be effective. In reality, it's not that simple.

Rats are very suspicious. They avoid anything new in their environment, even food, at first. If, before poisoning the rats, we put the food that will later contain poison in places where rats appear for a few days, and then add the poison, the effect is often very good, and it can kill a large number of rats at once.

To save rat poison and food, it is best to tightly block all rat holes that can be found with gravel and broken bricks before poisoning. Check them after two days. If these blockages have been dug open again, it indicates that rats have been there, and poisoned bait can be placed near these holes.

Currently, the only rat poison that can be bought in pharmaceutical companies and supply and marketing cooperatives is Antu. The following methods can usually be used to make Antu poisoned bait:

	1. Use oil or egg white to stick Antu to food.
	2. Sprinkle Antu on cut melons and fruits.

It is best to put out the poisoned bait at night and collect it in the morning, because rats are mostly active at night. At the same time, poultry are already locked up and children are sleeping, which is safer. In the days after placing the poison, carefully search for and bury rat carcasses to prevent them from rotting and affecting hygiene.

Some rats live in the ceiling and have no rat holes. In that case, place the poisoned bait in places where rats frequently appear.

When we are placing poisoned bait, we should store all food (including livestock feed) so that rats cannot find any food other than the poisoned bait. This can improve the effectiveness of rat poisoning. In grain and food enterprises, because there is usually a lot of food, the effect of placing poisoned bait is often poor. You can use a small dish to hold half a dish of water (sugar water is even better) and place it where rats appear. If the water decreases quickly, it indicates that rats have drunk it. More water should be added here and Antu sprinkled on the surface of the water (without letting it sink to the bottom), which is often effective. In winter, it is easy for water to freeze in warehouses in the north. You can mix Antu with twenty times the amount of snow, mix well, and make small balls, which is also very effective.

In addition to the above methods, you can also mix one part of Antu with five to ten parts of grain flour (preferably cooked), mix well, and sprinkle it in the rat holes.

As long as we can decide on rat poisoning methods according to the specific situation and take other measures (such as trapping), it is possible to eliminate rats.

    毒鼠要注意方法
    汪诚信
    一般人往往把毒鼠工作看得过于简单，以为只要在食物里放上毒药，扔到有鼠出现的地方就可以收到效果。其实，并不是那样简单。
    老鼠很多疑，对于它生活环境中新出现的东西，那怕是食物，最初也是回避的。如果我们能在毒鼠前，把以后要加毒药的食物，先放在有鼠出现的地方，过几天，再把毒药加进去，效果往往很好，一次就能毒死较多的老鼠。
    为了节省毒鼠药和食物，毒鼠前最好把能找到的鼠洞用碎石、碎砖严密地堵塞好，过两天检查一下，如果这些堵塞物又被掘开了，就表明有鼠来过，可以在这些洞的附近放毒饵。
    目前能在医药公司和供销社买到的毒鼠药，只有安妥。通常可以用以下几种方法做安妥毒饵：
    1、利用油或蛋清把安妥沾在食物上；
    2、把安妥撒在切开的瓜果上；
    毒饵最好在晚上放，清晨收回。因为老鼠多半是在夜间活动的；同时这时家禽已关好，小孩也在睡觉，比较安全。在放过药以后的几天，要仔细地寻找和掩埋鼠尸，以免鼠尸腐烂，妨碍卫生。
    有些地方的老鼠，居住在天花板上，没有鼠洞。那就把毒饵放在经常有鼠出现的地方。
    在我们布放毒饵的时候，应该收藏好所有的食物（包括牲畜的饲料），使老鼠除了毒饵以外，找不到别的食物。这样可以提高毒鼠的效果。在粮食和食品企业里，由于平常食物很多，放毒饵效果往往较差。可以用小碟盛半碟水（如用糖水更好），放在有鼠出现的地方，如果水很快的减少，表明有老鼠喝过。应该在这里再盛上水，把安妥撒在水面上（不要让它沉底），效果常常很好。在冬天，北方的仓库放置水容易结冰，可以把安妥加上二十倍的雪，拌匀，捏成小团，也很有效。
    除以上方法外，还可以用一份安妥加上五到十份粮食粉（最好是熟的），拌匀，撒在鼠洞里。
    只要我们能根据具体情况来决定毒鼠方法，并采取其它措施（如捕鼠），是可以消灭老鼠的。
