Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: A vigorous upsurge has formed within the Chinese People's Liberation Army regarding the activity of mobilizing military dependents to return to their hometowns for production and participate in socialist construction. According to incomplete statistics, by the beginning of this month, over 115,900 military officers' and salaried staff's dependents throughout the army have left their units and returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production. The number of dependents preparing to return home for production during the New Year and Spring Festival is no less than several hundred thousand.

The upsurge in mobilizing military dependents to return home for production rapidly unfolded throughout the army after the General Political Department issued instructions. A certain unit stationed in Beijing saw over a hundred big-character posters with dependents signing up to return home for production on the second day after seeing the instructions. Within two days of the mobilization by the leaders of the Shenyang-stationed troops, over 1,100 military dependents had already embarked on their journey home. Recent statistics from the Railway Engineering Corps show that the number of returning dependents has reached 53.9% of the total number of military dependents. As of now, over 47% of the total number of military dependents stationed in Jinan have returned home for production. Currently, 40% of the military dependents of the Training and Supervision Department have returned home. In many units of the Fujian front-line troops and troops stationed in Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Kunming, Wuhan, and Lanzhou, the number of dependents who have signed up to return home and those who have already returned has reached 60% to 90% of the total number of military dependents. A large number of military dependents of the troops stationed in Inner Mongolia are returning to rural areas and pastures in batches and phases. The military officers' dependents of the Qingfeng County conscription agency in Henan Province have all returned to their hometowns and taken up agricultural production posts.

The broad masses of military officers, salaried staff, and their dependents have demonstrated a high degree of socialist consciousness in the activity of mobilizing military dependents to return home for production. The vast majority believe that mobilizing dependents to return home has seven major benefits: increasing the rural labor force; reducing the urban burden; benefiting the modernization of the army; benefiting the strengthening of army-civilian unity; benefiting the dependents' labor training and progress; benefiting the officers themselves in concentrating their energies, studying their work, and striving for improvement; and also increasing household income. Therefore, they have actively arranged plans for returning home to settle down and engage in production, and many dependents have expressed their determination to return home for production on big-character posters and in discussion meetings. Many responsible officers have taken the lead in signing up their dependents. Party and League members among the dependents, as well as many past labor models and agricultural production experts, have been even more eager to return home first. In many units, the moving scenes of wives sending their husbands and mothers sending their sons to the front during the war years have reappeared today with the new content of husbands sending their wives and sons sending their mothers home to settle down and embark on the production front. Even many dependents who meet the temporary conditions for accompanying the military have actively signed up to return home. Captain Yang Yongtai of a certain unit stationed in Shenyang and his wife not only took the lead in responding to the call to mobilize dependents to return home for production, but also actively mobilized others to return home, causing seven out of the eight dependents in their unit to leave at once. Major Zheng Yinglin of a certain unit of the Railway Engineering Corps also took the lead in mobilizing his own dependents to return home, setting a model action that motivated forty-four dependents to leave their units and return home. Many of the military officers stationed in Nanjing have dependents working in government agencies, and these officers actively support and mobilize the dependents who have been approved by government agencies to go up to the mountains and down to the countryside, resolutely embarking on the agricultural labor front.

In the work of mobilizing dependents to return home for production, leaders at all levels of the military have paid close attention to doing a good job in ideological mobilization, improving the socialist consciousness of officers and their dependents, and ensuring that they truly leave their units and return home consciously, voluntarily, and happily. After the General Political Department issued instructions mobilizing dependents to return home for production, all units convened enlarged party committee meetings or political work meetings, formulating plans and taking various measures with a responsible spirit to ensure that this work was done well. Many units used big-character posters or held discussion meetings, family meetings, individual heart-to-heart talks, and other methods to publicize the significance and benefits of returning home for production to officers and their dependents, and to resolve their ideological problems. Many unit leaders also went deep among the dependents to understand the difficulties they faced in returning home for production and enthusiastically helped them solve these difficulties. In order to help military dependents solve the difficulties they faced when returning home, the naval leading organs specially established a naval dependents handling committee. The troops stationed in Guangzhou also formed a dependents return-to-hometown work group to help returning dependents with transfer procedures and household registration migration. The Shanghai garrison also set up service centers for military dependents returning home for production at railway stations and wharves to assist dependents in purchasing train and boat tickets.

    增加农村劳动力减轻城市负担利国利己
    十一万多军官家属回到家乡生产
    新华社13日讯　动员随军家属还乡生产、参加社会主义建设的活动，已经在中国人民解放军中形成一个声势浩大的热潮。据不完全统计，到本月上旬，全军已经有十一万五千九百多名军官和工薪制职员的家属离开部队，回到家乡参加农业生产。准备在新年和春节期间返乡生产的家属，已不下数十万人。
    动员随军家属还乡生产的热潮，是从总政发布指示后迅速在全军范围内展开的。北京驻军某部，在看到指示后的第二天，就出现了一百多张家属报名回乡生产的大字报。驻沈阳的部队在驻军首长动员后的两天内，就有一千一百多户随军家属踏上了归途。铁道兵部队最近统计，回乡家属已达随军家属总户数的53.9％。驻济南的部队到目前止，回乡生产的随军家属也已占到随军家属总人数的47％以上。训练总监部目前已有40％的随军家属回了家。福建前线部队和上海、南京、广州、成都、昆明、武汉、兰州等地驻军的许多单位，报名回乡和已经回乡的家属，已达随军家属总人数的60％到90％以上。驻内蒙古的部队大批随军家属正在分批分期地回到农村和牧场。河南省清丰县兵役机关的军官家属已经全部回到家乡，踏上农业生产岗位。
    部队广大军官、工薪制职员和他们的家属，在动员随军家属还乡生产的活动中，表现了高度的社会主义觉悟。绝大部分人认为动员家属还乡有七大好处：增加农村劳动力；减轻城市负担；有利于军队现代化建设；有利于增强军民团结；有利于家属的劳动锻炼和进步；有利于军官本人集中精力，钻研业务，力求上进；还能够增加家庭收入。因此，他们纷纷主动安排还乡安家生产计划，许多家属在大字报上、座谈会上表示自己还乡生产的决心。许多负责军官带头为自己的家属报名。家属中的党、团员和许多过去的劳动模范和农业生产能手，更是踊跃争先还乡。在许多部队里，战争时期妻送郎、母送子上前线的动人情景，今天又以郎送妻、子送母还乡安家落户、走上生产战线的新的内容出现了。甚至连许多合乎暂时随军条件的家属，也都积极地报名回乡。驻沈阳的部队某部大尉杨永太和他的爱人不但首先响应动员家属还乡生产的号召，而且还积极动员别人还乡，使他们所在单位的八户家属一下子走了七户。铁道兵某部少校郑英林也以带头动员自己家属还乡的模范行动，带动了四十四户家属离队还乡。驻南京的部队的军官有不少家属在政府机关工作，这些军官积极支持和动员已被政府机关批准上山下乡的家属，坚决地走上农业劳动战线。
    在动员家属还乡生产工作中，部队各级领导都十分注意做好思想动员工作，提高军官和家属的社会主义觉悟，使他们真正做到自觉自愿地愉快地离队还乡。总政动员家属还乡生产的指示发出后，各单位都召开了党委扩大会或政工会议，以认真负责的精神，制订规划，采取各种措施，保证做好这一工作。许多部队运用大字报或召开座谈会、家庭会、个别谈心等方式，向军官和家属宣传还乡生产的意义和好处，解决她们的思想问题。不少部队的首长还深入到家属中去了解她们回乡生产的困难，并热情地帮助她们解决这些困难。海军领导机关为了帮助随军家属解决回乡时的困难，专门成立了海军家属处理委员会。驻广州的部队也组成了家属返乡工作组，帮助返乡家属办理转移手续和迁移户口。上海驻军还在火车站、码头上设立随军家属返乡生产服务处，协助家属购买车票和船票。（附图片）
