Listen to Their Words, Observe Their Deeds
By a commentator of this newspaper

On Christmas night, U.S. President Eisenhower declared in a radio address, "We are determined not to let war happen." If this statement could be taken seriously, it would certainly be a good thing. However, we also heard Eisenhower's Secretary of State Dulles say something else.

On the same radio program, Dulles revealed the so-called "approach to achieving peace": "Peace cannot be achieved through weakness," "Strength is our deterrent to prevent war." The reason is that military work must continue, and we must possess armaments in the most effective way possible, decide to increase the ability of European allies to produce modern weapons launching systems to a greater extent, mainly the United States continuing to manufacture the atomic core parts of warheads, while Western Europe will also begin to manufacture weapons including medium-range ballistic missiles... To implement these decisions, Dulles said: "This will require sustained effort and sacrifice, perhaps requiring all of us to make many sacrifices." This is the "loyalty" to peace professed on Christmas night by the representatives of the American ruling group before God. How can one find a hint of peace here? The American ruling group, after the bankruptcy of the "deterrence policy," continues to tout the infamous "position of strength" policy, while singing praises of "peace." It is truly outrageous and presumptuous. Yet, Dulles put on a helpless and pitiful face, professing that this "policy of strength" is necessary because the Soviet Union lacks the "sincerity" for peace! Well, let us lay out the facts.

The Soviet Union proposed, together with the United States and Britain, to cease all nuclear weapons tests starting from January 1, 1958; however, the United States disagreed with such a simple, easy-to-implement, peace-promoting, and universally desired good thing.

The Soviet Union proposed abandoning the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, disbanding military blocs, and establishing a collective security system in Europe and Asia. Undoubtedly, if these proposals were accepted, a new peaceful situation would immediately appear in the world. But the United States refused again.

The Soviet Union proposed concluding a U.S.-Soviet friendship treaty, holding U.S.-Soviet talks, convening a summit conference of socialist and capitalist countries, and achieving peaceful coexistence. However, the United States, fearing peaceful competition, does not even dare to mention holding such a conference, fearing that even a slight relaxation of the international situation would cause military stocks to plummet immediately.

In order to remove obstacles on the road to peaceful coexistence and create an atmosphere conducive to international mutual trust, the Soviet Union has repeatedly stated and solemnly resolved by the Supreme Soviet that the Soviet government should study the issue of further reducing the Soviet armed forces. However, Dulles stubbornly insisted that the Soviet Union was "continuing to increase armaments."

Every person with a conscience: do these peace initiatives proposed by the Soviet Union resemble what Dulles called "either threats or inducements"? Even American officials believe that the Soviet Union, which has surpassed the United States in the latest military technology, has not made things difficult for others and treats everyone equally. Can it not be judged from this who wants peace and who wants war? And who is adding difficulties to the road of peaceful coexistence?

Listen to their words and observe their deeds is a good experience left by our Chinese ancestors to judge right from wrong and good from evil. If the American ruling group is truly determined "not to let war happen," they should at least take some minimum action.

    听其言，察其行
    本报评论员
    圣诞节晚上，美国总统艾森豪威尔在广播谈话中宣告：“我们决心不让战争发生”。这话果能当真，当然是件好事。不过，我们还听到了艾森豪威尔的国务卿杜勒斯说了另一种话。
    就在同一个广播器前面，杜勒斯透露了所谓“实现和平”的方针：“和平不可能通过孱弱来实现”，“实力就是我们防止战争的威慑力量”。理由是：军备工作必须继续进行，必须以可行的最有效的方式来拥有军备，决定在更大程度上增加欧洲盟国生产现代武器发射体系的能力，主要由美国继续制造弹头的原子核部分，同时，西欧也要开始制造包括中程弹道导弹在内的武器……。为了执行这些决定，杜勒斯说：“这将需要持久的努力和牺牲，或许需要我们大家都作出很多的牺牲。”这就是圣诞节晚上，由美国统治集团的代表人物，在上帝面前，表白的对和平的“忠诚”。从这里，怎么找得出一点和平味道呢？美国统治集团，在“威慑政策”破产以后，继续吹嘘臭名远扬的“实力地位”政策，而又高唱“和平”。真是欺人太甚和太不自量了。可是，杜勒斯还装出了一副无可奈何的可怜相，表白了一番这种“实力政策”之所以必要，是由于苏联没有和平的“诚意”啊！好吧，就让我们来摆一摆事实。
    苏联建议同美英一起，从1958年1月1日开始，停止核武器的一切试验；可是，对于这样一件简单易行、有利和平、全世界人民梦寐以求的好事，美国却不同意。
    苏联建议放弃使用原子武器和氢武器，解散军事集团，建立欧洲和亚洲的集体安全体系。无疑的，如果这些建议被接受了，世界上立刻就会出现一个新的和平局面。可是，美国又不干。
    苏联建议缔结美苏友好条约，举行美苏会谈，召开社会主义国家和资本主义国家政府的首脑会议，实现和平共处。可是，害怕和平竞赛的美国，连说说召开这样的会议都不敢出口，只怕沾了缓和国际局势的边，军事股票马上会一落千丈。
    苏联为了扫除通向和平共处道路上的障碍，创造有利国际间互相信任的气氛，一再表示并且郑重地由最高苏维埃会议决议，责成苏联政府研究进一步裁减苏联武装部队的问题。可是杜勒斯却硬说苏联在“继续增加军备”。
    每一个有良知的人：这些苏联提出的和平倡议，像不像杜勒斯所说的“不是威胁就是利诱”呢？连美国官员们也认为在最新军事技术上已经超过了美国的苏联，却并没有强人所难，处处平等待人。难道从此还不能判断出究竟是谁要和平、谁要战争？又是谁在和平共处前进的道路上增加了困难吗？
    听其言，察其行，是我们中国人的祖先遗留下来的一条判断是非善恶的好经验。美国统治集团如果真有“不让战争发生”的决心的话，至少应该拿出一点最低限度的行动来。
