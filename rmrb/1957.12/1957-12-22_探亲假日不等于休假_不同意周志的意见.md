    Visiting Relatives' Holiday is Not Equal to Vacation
    Disagreeing with Zhou Zhi's Opinion
    Comrade Zhou Zhi believes that "the visiting relatives holiday is too general" and suggests that the holidays should be appropriately extended for those who live far away, based on the length of the journey. (See page 3 of this newspaper on November 29th)
    I disagree with this view. I believe that the provisions of the draft are relatively reasonable at present. The reasons are: First, the regulations stipulate that those whose round trip journey takes more than ten days can be given a holiday once every two years, with the holiday lasting five to six weeks. In this way, there is room for appropriate extension or shortening of the holiday for those who live far away and those who live nearby. Second, visiting relatives' holiday is not equal to vacation. The state provides holidays during working hours for visiting relatives, with the purpose of enabling employees who are far from their hometowns and cannot reunite with their families for a long time to reunite with their parents and spouses, not for vacation, so it is enough to achieve the purpose of reunion. Comrade Zhou Zhi demands that the number of days spent at home by employees who live far away and those who live nearby should remain basically equal. I will say frankly that there is a certain degree of egalitarianism in this. Third, at present, the personnel of each unit are fixed to a certain extent. If the holiday is too long, and if there are several employees who live far away in a workshop or department, and each of them has to ask for a long time off every two years, then it will affect production and work. Otherwise, the staffing will have to be increased, which is contrary to the principles of building the country diligently and thriftily and running enterprises diligently and thriftily.

### 探亲假日不等于休假  不同意周志的意见

    探亲假日不等于休假
    不同意周志的意见
    周志同志认为“探亲假期太笼统”，建议对家远的应根据旅途的长短适当延长假期。（见11月29日本报三版）
    我不同意这种看法。我认为，草案的规定在目前来说还是比较合理的。理由是：第一、规定往返旅途在十日以上的可以每两年给假一次，假期为五个星期至六个星期，这样，家远的和家近的就有了适当延长或缩短假期的余地。第二，探亲假日不等于休假。国家在工作时间给假期探亲，目的是使远离家乡、长时间不能与家人团聚的职工，和父母、爱人团聚，而不是休假，所以只要达到团聚的目的就可以了。周志同志要求家远的和家近的职工在家逗留的天数保持基本相等。我不客气地说，这里有一定的平均主义思想。第三，目前各单位的人员有一定，假日过于长，要是一个车间或科室里有几个家较远的职工，每人每两年都要请很长时间的假，那末，就会影响生产和工作。要不然，就得增加编制，这是跟勤俭建国，勤俭办企业的方针相矛盾的。
