　　Socialist Education Courses Must Be Studied Thoroughly

    Ministry of Higher Education and Ministry of Education Instruct Universities and Colleges to Conscientiously Arrange Courses

    Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: The Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education recently issued "Instructions on Opening Socialist Education Courses in National Universities and Colleges," stipulating that all grades in national universities and colleges should universally offer "Socialist Education" courses, and all students and graduate students must participate in the study without exception.

    The instructions stated that the content of this course is based on Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" as the central teaching material, as stipulated by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and at the same time, it is necessary to read some necessary Marxist-Leninist classics, Party documents, and other documents. Each school should, according to the "Reading Materials for Socialist Education Courses" compiled by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, combine the political and ideological problems exposed during the period of great contending and blooming and the anti-Rightist struggle in the school, stipulate teaching plans and reading materials that are in line with the actual situation of the school, and determine the focus of learning, and strive to study thoroughly.

    In order to enable students to seriously learn this course and achieve the goal of transforming their thinking and improving their socialist awareness, the instructions require that when lecturing and tutoring in each school, it is necessary to closely link with the actual thinking of students, use the thinking of the working class to criticize the thinking of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, and use the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint, and method to overcome the non-Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint, and method. At the same time, students should be guided to carefully read documents in a planned way, and organize free and full discussions and debates. During discussions and debates, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of unity—criticism—unity, use the method of presenting facts and reasoning to present various facts and viewpoints, fully reason, repeatedly argue, let everyone speak freely, and achieve the goal of distinguishing right from wrong.

    Regarding the learning time of this course, the instructions stipulate that it will be one academic year for the time being, eight hours per week (no less than four hours of class time), and if necessary, the time for current affairs policy learning and Communist Youth League activities can be used. Social science departments can appropriately increase learning time. Graduating classes, internship classes, and other classes with special circumstances can complete the study in a concentrated period of time. If the above-mentioned stipulated learning time is felt to be insufficient, the minimum reading materials can be reduced, or the learning can be extended to two academic years.

    The instructions stated that during the period when each class is studying the socialist education course, the original four political courses that should be offered will be suspended, but political theory courses as professional courses, such as political economics for the economics department, political education department, and departmental economics majors, will still be offered as usual.

    As for secondary vocational schools, the instructions stated that they can combine the specific circumstances of the school, take Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" as the main teaching material, stipulate learning content and reference materials, and study for four hours per week.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th dispatch: The socialist ideological education course in Shenyang universities and colleges is being actively prepared, and it is expected that each school can begin systematic lectures in March next year.

    Currently, under the unified leadership of the Higher Education Department, the Propaganda Department, and the Learning Office of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, a socialist ideological education research group has been established for major universities and colleges in the city. Most of the members of the group are deputy secretaries of the Party Committee, propaganda ministers, and directors of the Marxist-Leninist teaching and research offices of each university and college, and are responsible for the writing and research work of the teaching syllabus for socialist ideological education in the city. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has also drawn more than 50 political teachers with a higher level of theory from eight universities and colleges to participate in this preparation work; and sent this group of teachers to factories, handicraft production cooperatives, and agricultural production cooperatives to participate in the rectification campaign and socialist education movement, so that they can further enrich and clarify the content of socialist ideological education in the actual struggle.

　　社会主义教育课程要学深学透
    高教部教育部指示高等学校切实安排课程
    新华社17日讯　高等教育部、教育部最近发出“关于在全国高等学校开设社会主义教育课程的指示”，规定在全国高等学校各年级普遍开设“社会主义教育”课程，全体学生和研究生必须无例外地参加学习。
    指示说，这一课程学习的内容，中共中央宣传部规定是以毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”为中心教材，同时阅读一些必要的马克思列宁主义经典著作、党的文件和其他文件。各校应根据中共中央宣传部编写的“社会主义教育课程的阅读文件”，结合本校大鸣大放期间和反右派斗争中暴露出来的政治思想问题，规定切合本校实际的教学计划与阅读文件，并确定学习重点，力求学深学透。
    为了使学生认真学好这一课程，能够达到改造思想、提高社会主义觉悟的目的，指示要求各校讲授与辅导时，要密切联系学生思想实际，用工人阶级思想批判资产阶级思想、小资产阶级思想，用马列主义的立场、观点、方法克服非马列主义的立场、观点、方法。同时，要有计划地指导学生精读文件，并组织自由的和充分的讨论、辩论。讨论和辩论时，要坚持团结——批评——团结的原则，用摆事实、讲道理的方法把各种事实和观点摆出来，充分说理、反复争论，让大家畅所欲言，达到明辨是非的目的。
    关于这一课程的学习时间，指示规定暂为一学年，每周八小时（课内时间不得少于四小时），必要时可以利用时事政策学习和党团活动的时间。社会科学系科可以适当增加学习时间。毕业班、实习班及其他有特殊情况的班级，可以集中在一个时期内学完。上述规定的学习时间，如果感到不足，可以缩减最低限度的阅读文件，或延长到两学年学完。
    指示说，各班级在学习社会主义教育课程期间，原应开的四门政治课一律停开，但作为专业课的政治理论课，例如经济系、政治教育系和部门经济专业的政治经济学仍照开。
    至于中等专业学校，指示说，可以结合本校的具体情况，以毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”为主要教材，订定学习内容与参考文件，学习时间每周四小时。
    新华社沈阳17日电　沈阳市高等学校社会主义思想教育课正在积极准备，预计明年3月各校就可开始系统地讲授。
    目前，在中共沈阳市委员会高等教育部、宣传部和市委学习室统一领导下成立了全市各大专学校社会主义思想教育研究小组。小组成员大部分是各高等学校党委副书记、宣传部长、马列主义教研室主任，负责全市社会主义思想教育教学提纲的编写研究工作。中共沈阳市委又从八个高等学校抽调五十多名理论水平较高的政治课教师，参加了这次准备工作；并把这批教师派到工厂、手工业生产合作社和农业生产合作社去参加整风和社会主义教育运动，使他们在实际的斗争中进一步丰富和明确社会主义思想教育的内容。
