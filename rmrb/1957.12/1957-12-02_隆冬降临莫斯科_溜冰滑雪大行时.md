　　Deep Winter Descends on Moscow
　　Skating and Skiing are in Full Swing
    Our Moscow Dispatch, December 1st. The weather in Moscow has suddenly turned cold in the last few days, with outdoor temperatures nearing fifteen degrees below zero. The parks and suburbs are covered with carpets of white snow. Winter has arrived, and the season for winter sports has begun. The number of customers buying skates, skis, and winter sportswear in stores has greatly increased. In the last month alone, the State Department Store has sold more than 17,000 pairs of skis. Most of the ice rinks began accepting skaters a few days ago. The ice rink at the Central Stadium in Luzhniki opened yesterday. It is a vast ice rink of 120,000 square meters, where 3,000 pairs of skates are available for rent. This winter, skaters in Moscow will have access to 1.5 million square meters of ice. Muscovites also often convert courtyards into small ice rinks. Last year, there were 500 such small ice rinks. The Communist Youth League organizations are mobilizing young people to open more of these small ice rinks. Muscovites have also begun skiing. The forests of Izmailovo Park are a good place for skiing, and it opened yesterday, with 1,600 pairs of skis available for use. The Likhachev Factory and the Dynamo Factory have both prepared ski resorts.

　　溜冰滑雪大行时
    本报莫斯科1日电　最近几天，莫斯科天气骤然冷起来，室外温度将近零下十五度。公园和郊外复盖了白雪的地毡。冬天来到了，冬季运动的季节开始了。商店里冰鞋、雪板，冬季运动衣裤的顾客大大增加。最近一个月内国家百货商场就卖出了一万七千多对雪板。大部分的冰场几天前已经开始接受滑冰者。卢日尼其中央体育场的冰场昨天开幕，那是十二万平方公尺宽广的冰场，那里有三千双冰鞋出租。这个冬季，莫斯科滑冰的人们可以得到一百五十万平方公尺的冰场。莫斯科人也常把庭院改作小冰场。去年有这样的小冰场五百座。共青团组织正发动青年们多开辟这样的小冰场。莫斯科人也开始了滑雪的运动。伊兹迈尔公园的林间是滑雪的好地方，昨天开放了，那里有一千六百对滑雪板供人使用。李哈厫夫工厂、狄纳摩工厂都准备了滑雪场所。
