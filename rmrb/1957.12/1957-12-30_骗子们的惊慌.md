    The Swindlers' Panic
    After the Soviet representative at the Asian-African Solidarity Conference expressed willingness to provide assistance to underdeveloped countries, some people in the United States were shocked and dismayed. The "New York Herald Tribune" said that this was the "most dangerous challenge" to the United States.
    Why is it the "most dangerous challenge"? The "New York Herald Tribune" believes that the main reason is that Soviet aid "will be unconditional," while the United States has never been like that.
    Conditional or unconditional has become a touchstone for the people of Asia and Africa to identify true aid from false aid. In the face of genuine Soviet aid, American false aid is even more difficult to deceive people, which is the real reason why the swindlers feel "most dangerous."

    骗子们的惊慌
    苏联代表在亚非团结大会上表示愿意对不发达国家提供援助以后，美国有些人竟惊慌失色。“纽约先驱论坛报”说，这是对美国“最危险的挑战”。
    为什么是“最危险的挑战”呢？“纽约先驱论坛报”认为，主要因为苏联的援助“将是无条件的”，而美国从来都不是这样。
    有条件还是无条件，已经成为亚非人民识别真援助和假援助的试金石。在苏联的真援助面前，美国的假援助是更难骗人了，这就是骗子们感到“最危险”的真正原因。
