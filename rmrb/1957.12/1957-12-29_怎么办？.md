    According to the Washington correspondent of the British "Scotsman," the United States is afraid of the proposal made by the Soviet Union and Poland to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, because this proposal is so attractive that "European countries may rush to line up to join this zone."
    The correspondent reported that Washington does not want this to happen before it possesses missiles that it can launch from its own territory and send 5,000 miles to the Soviet Union.
    However, one must ask, if the broad masses of the American people are also attracted by this proposal and also demand to join such a zone, what will the rulers of Washington do then?

    怎么办？
    据英国“苏格兰人报”驻华盛顿记者报道，美国害怕苏联和波兰所提出的在中欧建立一个无原子武器区的建议，因为这个建议如此地吸引人，以致“欧洲国家可能会争先恐后地排队来加入这个地区。”
    这位记者报道说，华盛顿在拥有它能够从它自己的领土上经过五千英里发射到苏联的导弹之前，不希望发生这种事情。
    但是，人们要问，如果广大的美国人民也被这个建议所吸引，并且也要求加入这样一个地区的话，华盛顿的统治者到那时候又将怎么办呢？
