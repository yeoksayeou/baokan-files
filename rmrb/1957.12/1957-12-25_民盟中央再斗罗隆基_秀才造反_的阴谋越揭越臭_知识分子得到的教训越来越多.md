Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: The Central Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL) held three consecutive league member conferences from the 21st to the 23rd to refute Luo Longji and criticize the crimes and fallacies of the Zhang-Luo alliance in opposing the Communist Party, the people, and socialism.

Shen Junru, Chairman of the CDL, and other responsible persons of the CDL Central Committee attended the conference. At these three conferences, more than one hundred people spoke. Using the method of presenting facts and reasoning, they conducted a profound and thorough exposure and criticism of the important reactionary arguments of Luo Longji and the Zhang-Luo alliance. Luo Longji's conspiracy to instigate so-called "scholars rebelling" by exploiting intellectuals aroused the greatest indignation among the participants. Many senior intellectuals, in their speeches, tore off Luo Longji's mask as the self-proclaimed "representative of great intellectuals," unanimously pointing out that he was a degenerate among Chinese intellectuals.

Qian Jiaju, Hua Luogeng, Sun Chenge, Jin Yuelin, Zhang Guofan, and Wen Jiasi, in a joint statement, pointed out that Luo Longji's fallacies regarding the issue of intellectuals were his political program and action program against the Communist Party. The Party wants us intellectuals to transform ourselves into intellectuals of the working class so that we can better serve the socialist cause. However, Luo Longji wants us to take the capitalist road of retreat and transform our new China according to the image of the bourgeoisie. This is a struggle between two roads. It is a struggle between two roads among intellectuals: whether or not to take the socialist road, whether or not to have the leadership of the working class, whether or not to have the dictatorship of the proletariat, and whether or not to have the leadership of the Communist Party.

They said: Luo Longji chose intellectuals as his capital to attack the Party, and this was with his own intentions. First, after the three major transformations, the bourgeoisie had already handed over their means of production, while bourgeois intellectuals still had capital. Their capital is knowledge, and at the same time, socialist construction cannot do without intellectuals. Thus, in Luo Longji's mind, this was a reliable capital that he could use to compete with the working class. Second, bourgeois intellectuals have two sides. Their positive side tends to accept socialist transformation, accept the leadership of the Communist Party, and express support and satisfaction for the increasing strength of our country; the negative side is nostalgia for capitalism, nostalgia for the bourgeois lifestyle, and incompatibility with the new society. They still have a considerable distance from the ideological and emotional feelings of the working class. This negative side is precisely what Luo Longji regards as the characteristic of old intellectuals, which can be used as capital to attack the Party and socialism. Third, the ranks of Chinese working-class intellectuals are still relatively weak. Our country has only been established for eight years, and the majority of old intellectuals are still in an intermediate state, their positions have not undergone fundamental transformation, and the new ranks of worker-peasant intellectuals have not yet grown up. This made Luo Longji have illusions, thinking that the Party was weakest in intellectuals, and using this to attack the Party could break through a point and win the overall situation. But Luo Longji's calculation was wrong.

"Having Absolutely No Ambition," Luo Longji Wanted to Be Wang Mang, Attempting to Seize the People's World by Exploiting the Opportunity

Zhu Guangqian, in his speech, pointed out that Luo Longji's conspiracy to use intellectuals to attack the Communist Party can be divided into three major steps. The first step is to recruit troops and buy horses. He styled himself as the "spokesperson for intellectuals," putting on a fox-like face to curry favor with intellectuals, saying that the Party does not trust you, wants to insult you, I will speak out for your grievances, I will let you "hold your head high and vent your anger." Even for counter-revolutionaries, Luo Longji may give him a share of the country.

The second step is for scholars to rebel. Luo Longji had long told Pu Xixiu very clearly, "Don't think that without guns and bullets you can't force the palace. Wang Mang obtained the throne without spending a single soldier or weapon. When the trend of disintegration has formed, if the rioters shout, the whole world will respond." It turns out that this Luo Longji, who claims to "have absolutely no ambition," also wanted to be Wang Mang when "the rioters shout, the whole world responds." Wang Mang did usurpation, and Luo Longji also wanted to usurp the Communist Party's position.

Luo Longji and others also had a final trump card, which was to lead wolves into the house and rely on their American masters. They greeted the Hungarian incident with excitement. When Luo Longji's group of rightists frantically attacked the Party, their assessment was that a situation similar to the Hungarian incident had already arrived in China, so they took the opportunity to rise up, set fires everywhere, and attempted to create a Hungarian incident, thereby inviting American imperialism to intervene.

Liang Sicheng, Ye Hecai, Liu Chongle, Li Youshan, Lu Shijia, Chen Zongqi, Chen Dingwen, Zhang Wei, and Tong Dizhou gave a joint statement entitled "Who Should Lead Whom?" They pointed out that the most vicious arrow released by Luo Longji's poison was "the petty-bourgeois small intellectuals leading the petty-bourgeois large intellectuals." This sentence is the crystallization of Luo Longji's political line. The essence of this arrogant clamor is to have the bourgeoisie lead the proletariat. They said that under the major premise of building socialism, the Communist Party is the greatest expert. In the eight years since liberation, the brilliant achievements we have made in the economic, cultural, artistic, scientific, and technological fields are something that even Luo Longji "cannot deny in his conscience." But we want to ask Luo Longji, under whose leadership were these achievements made? Was it under the leadership of "petty-bourgeois large intellectuals"? No. These brilliant achievements were made under the leadership of the vanguard of the working class - the Communist Party of China.

Feng Youlan said at the meeting that Luo Longji and his small group believe that it is now "the Party's world." He incited intellectuals to say to the Party: If you want to maintain your "Party's world," you have to buy my intellectuals' "talents," you have to "treat scholars with courtesy," "visit the thatched cottage three times," I have "opposition" and you cannot "eliminate," I have backward thoughts, and you cannot transform them, I am a "scholar who can be killed but not humiliated." Luo Longji used this method to incite backward intellectuals, confuse intermediate intellectuals, and let them follow the Zhang-Luo alliance and confront the Party. In feudal and capitalist societies, intellectuals are always an employed class. Today, intellectuals exert their talents to build socialism and serve workers and peasants, entirely for their own benefit, not for others; they are masters, not slaves, there is no need to bargain, there is no such thing as "eating the king's salary and repaying the king's favor," nor is there such a thing as "a scholar dies for someone who understands him." In this case, intellectuals are truly not "humiliated" and truly enjoy dignity.

Serving as the "Savior of All" for Counter-Revolutionary Elements, Openly Engaging in Criminal Acts of Undermining the Constitution

At the meeting, many people also severely refuted Luo Longji's various fallacies and conspiracies on the issues of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the fundamental system of the state, and "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," thoroughly exposing the illegal organizational activities carried out by the Zhang-Luo alliance using the CDL.

The joint statement of Gong Xiangrui, Wang Ziquan, Zhou Xinmin, Zhou Shujia, Lin Zhongyi, Chen Chong, Rui Mu, Cao Jie, and Huang Genyong, on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, severely refuted Luo Longji's various anti-Communist fallacies, exposing his conspiratorial activities. They pointed out that the fundamental difference between the people and Luo Longji and all rightists on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries lies in the fact that the people advocate that all counter-revolutionary elements must be resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely suppressed in order to defend the victorious fruits of the people's revolution, while Luo Longji and other rightists still want to let them "rise up," overthrow the people's democratic regime, and let imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek make a comeback. Precisely because of this, at the symposium convened by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee on May 22, Luo Longji, as the commander of the rightists, put forward the proposal to establish a "Rehabilitation Committee," openly issuing a counter-revolutionary restoration call of "come and appeal for any grievances," attempting to overturn our original cases of suppressing counter-revolutionary elements in the past and subvert the people's democratic dictatorship. Less than a month after Luo Longji proposed the "Rehabilitation Committee," he received more than 170 letters supporting his "rehabilitation" proposal, each letter filled with counter-revolutionary rumors, slanders, and a chorus of mad barking. Some bluntly said that "China is about to change, and it is changing to an unimaginable extent." Some said that "Mr. Luo Longji's talks and suggestions are the suggestions of the 'savior of all'," asking him to lead counter-revolutionary elements to "transform" China led by the Communist Party. This ambitious Luo Longji, after receiving these letters that were right in line with his intentions, picked up his pen and wrote on these vicious letters, "This matter should be promoted by all circles to create public opinion, please suggest to the United Front Work Department and the CPPCC." This is ironclad proof that the rightist ringleader Luo Longji incited all counter-revolutionary elements to rise up and rebel.

The joint statement of Li Guojun, Wang Dezi, Deng Chumin, Chi Jishang, Sun Dianqing, Shao Xunzheng, Chen Shihua, Jiang Chengwen, Gao Tian, and Zhang Mingtao at the conference pointed out that one of the key political conspiracies of the Zhang-Luo alliance was to attempt to get rid of the leadership of the Communist Party, abolish the people's democratic dictatorship, and change the nature of the state power based on democratic centralism by starting with the organizational form of the state. Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun and other rightists worked in every possible way to distort and slander our country's fundamental system - the People's Congress system, and did not shy away from saying that he still "fantasizes about establishing British and American-style capitalist democracy in China," slandering the socialist people's democratic system as "undemocratic" and inferior to the bourgeois parliamentary system, and completely agreeing with Zhang Bojun's proposed "bicameral system." The bourgeois rightist elements describe the people's political consistency and the high degree of unified leadership of the whole country in our state organs as "lack of democracy," which is a tactical and malicious attack. They attempt to use the concept of "absolute democracy" to disperse the will of the working people and to disintegrate the organization and combat effectiveness of the working people. Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and others attempted to establish a so-called "Political Design Institute" and "Rehabilitation Committee," to have the rightist elements make decisions and "rehabilitate," and to usurp the leadership of the entire country. This is a criminal act that violates the Constitution and the will of the entire people.

The joint statement of Luo Ziwei, Wu Zhengyi, Wang Shiming, Zhang Manjun, Zhang Qiaose, Wu Keqing, Zhao Qinghuan, and Xiong Wei said that since the Communist Party put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," Luo Longji actively arranged for the malignant development of the CDL in order to expand the reactionary social base, accumulate reactionary political capital, and "compete with the Communist Party on an equal footing," attempting to "preserve a glimmer of vitality for capitalism" and seize the opportunity to restore it. They pointed out: The basis and premise of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" is to take the socialist road and accept the leadership of the Communist Party. Without this foundation and premise, long-term coexistence is simply impossible, and mutual supervision is simply out of the question. The fundamental difference between Luo Longji and us lies in the fact that he does not want democratic parties to take the socialist road, and he does not want democratic parties to accept the leadership of the Party. He wants to use capitalism as the foundation and attempt to turn democratic parties into opposition parties in the multi-party politics of capitalist countries.

Wu Yuheng, Feng Sutao, Yang Yibo, Shen Yifan, Chu Shenglin, Shi Hongxi, Yu Shengchun, Wang Maichu, and Xue Bomin revealed at the meeting that Luo Longji and the Zhang-Luo alliance, in order to achieve their sinister goals, had used the legal organizations of the CDL to carry out a series of non-organizational activities, usurping the leadership and real power of various levels of organizations within the league, expanding the rightist forces, and attacking the leftists. After 1956, this activity developed to an extremely rampant degree. During the Second National Congress of the CDL, Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun arranged for many of their trusted henchmen in the rightist group to be placed on the positions of central committee members and alternate central committee members, monopolizing the central leadership and real power. Up to now, the number of rightists among the league members nationwide accounts for about 7% of the total number of league members, but they account for 29% of all members of the Central Committee, 43% of alternate members of the Central Committee, and more than 36% of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee. The Zhang-Luo alliance also deployed its rightist clique forces to various important places, seizing the leadership of local organizations. According to preliminary investigations, among the twenty-four provincial (municipal) level local organizations of the CDL across the country, ten, including Shanghai, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Shaanxi, had all the leadership and real power usurped by the rightist group; among the county (city) level local organizations in large cities, there were six, including Wuhan, Chongqing, Jinan, Qingdao, Fuzhou, and Hangzhou. Among them, except for the two organizations in Anhui and Chongqing, the chairmen, vice-chairmen, and secretaries-general are mostly rightist elements. The rightist elements who control the real power of these organizations are all rightist core members who have organizational relationships with the Zhang-Luo alliance or who implement their political and organizational lines.

They said: Zhang Bojun, the leader of Luo Longji's alliance, declared everywhere after the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision began to be put forward that democratic parties should develop several million members to show the Communist Party a thing or two. Luo Longji believed that people who had been under control and those who were dissatisfied with various movements were the best targets for the CDL to develop, and that these people should be absorbed. More than 200 of the 431 newly developed league members in Wuhan alone had serious political and historical problems. Some grassroots organizations in Shanghai found that more than 60% of the rightist elements were problematic, and some grassroots organizations even had 100% problems.

Luo Longji Emptily Admits Great Sins, But Still Denies Specific Activities of the Zhang-Luo Alliance

Luo Longji made a so-called "confession" before the end of the conference on the 23rd. He said, "I have committed the crime of opposing the Party and opposing socialism," "I want to confess to the CDL, the Central Committee, and the people of the whole country." Luo Longji admitted that he had proposed to organize a "Rehabilitation Committee" and opposed the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, which was his most serious crime of opposing the Party, opposing the people, and opposing socialism. He said that he had previously denied this issue in an attempt to mitigate his crimes.

Luo Longji admitted that he did conspire to seize leadership in intellectuals in order to create a force to confront the Communist Party. He said: "All the activities of the Zhang-Luo alliance revolved around this conspiracy."

However, on the one hand, Luo Longji admitted that he and Zhang Bojun "had an alliance," that they "used the legal organization of the CDL to do many illegal things," and that his "crimes were greater than anyone else's." On the other hand, he categorically denied the specific activities of the Zhang-Luo alliance. On the one hand, he admitted that the things revealed at these three meetings "are all facts." On the other hand, he stubbornly denied, saying that some things were "things that he cannot admit even if he dies." At the same time, Luo Longji was unwilling to confess to any specific facts about his reactionary activities.

Luo Longji's attitude of trying every possible means to deny and refuse to confess aroused great anger among the people. After Luo Longji's "confession," many people immediately confronted him with the facts, exposing his decadent bourgeois life and severely criticizing his extremely dishonest attitude of attempting to continue to quibble. Those who attended the meeting once again warned Luo Longji: Failing to honestly confess his crimes will not gain the leniency of the people.

Finally, the executive chairman of the conference announced that the conference would continue.

    民盟中央再斗罗隆基
    “秀才造反”的阴谋越揭越臭　知识分子得到的教训越来越多
    新华社24日讯　中国民主同盟中央从21日到23日连续召开了三次盟员大会，驳斥罗隆基和批判章罗联盟反共反人民反社会主义的罪恶言行。
    民盟主席沈钧儒和民盟中央的其他负责人都出席了大会。在这三次大会上，有一百多人发了言。人们用摆事实讲道理的方法，把罗隆基和章罗联盟的重要反动论点，一个一个地进行了深刻地、彻底地揭露和批判。罗隆基妄图利用知识分子搞起所谓“秀才造反”的阴谋，激起了与会者的最大义愤。许多高级知识分子在发言中揭下了罗隆基以“大知识分子的代表”自居的画皮，一致指出他是中国知识分子的败类。
    千家驹、华罗庚、孙承谔、金岳霖、张国藩、闻家驷在联合发言中指出，罗隆基对于知识分子问题的谬论，是他反对共产党的政治纲领和行动纲领。党要我们知识分子改造成为工人阶级的知识分子，以便更好地为社会主义事业服务，罗隆基却要我们走资本主义的回头路，按照资产阶级的面貌来改造我们的新中国。这是两条道路的斗争，是在知识分子中究竟要不要走社会主义道路，要不要工人阶级领导，要不要无产阶级专政，要不要共产党的领导的两条道路的斗争。
    他们说：罗隆基选择知识分子作为他向党进攻的资本，这是有他的打算的。第一，在三大改造以后，资产阶级已经交出了他们的生产资料，而资产阶级知识分子却还有本钱，他们的本钱就是知识，同时要进行社会主义建设是缺少不了知识分子的。于是在罗隆基心目中，这是一笔他可以拿来同工人阶级较量一番最可靠的资本。其次，资产阶级知识分子是有两面性的，他们积极的一面倾向于接受社会主义改造，接受共产党的领导，对于我们国家的日趋强大表示拥护与满意；消极一面是留恋资本主义，留恋资产阶级的生活方式，与新社会格格不相入。他们同工人阶级的思想感情还有不少的距离。而这消极的一面，正是罗隆基所视为旧知识分子的特点，可以利用来向党向社会主义进攻的本钱。第三，中国工人阶级知识分子的队伍，还相当薄弱，我国建国才八年，旧知识分子的大多数还处在中间状态，立场未经过根本的改造，新的工农知识分子队伍还没有成长起来。这就使得罗隆基发生幻想，认为在知识分子上是党最薄弱的一环，利用这来向党进攻是可以突破一点，战胜全局的。但是罗隆基的算盘打错了。
    “绝无野心”的罗隆基想当王莽  妄图利用时机篡夺人民天下
    朱光潜在发言中指出，罗隆基妄图利用知识分子向共产党进攻的阴谋可以分为三大步骤。第一步是招兵买马。他自封为“知识分子的代言人”，摆出一副狐狸面孔，向知识分子讨好，说党是不信任你们的，要侮辱你们的，我替你们叫苦申冤，我让你们“抬头出气”。即使是反革命分子，罗隆基也许给他一份江山。
    第二步是秀才造反。罗隆基早就向浦熙修说得很清楚，“你不要以为无枪无弹就不能逼宫，王莽取得帝王，并未费一兵一卒。到了瓦解之势已成，乱者一呼，天下四应，”原来这位自称“绝无什么野心”的罗隆基还想在“乱者一呼，天下四应”的时候当王莽。王莽干的是篡位，罗隆基也就想篡共产党的位。
    罗隆基等手里还有最后一张王牌，那就是引狼入室，投靠他们的美国主子。他们是以兴奋的心情迎接匈牙利事件的。在罗隆基那批右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，他们的估计是类似匈牙利事件的局势在中国已经到来了，所以他们就乘机而起，到处放火，企图制造匈牙利事件，从而请美帝国主义插足干涉。
    梁思成、叶和才、刘崇乐、李酉山、陆士嘉、陈宗器、陈鼎文、张维、童第周以“应当谁领导谁？”为题联合发言。他们指出，罗隆基放出来的毒素中最恶毒的一枝箭就是“无产阶级小知识分子领导小资产阶级大知识分子”。这句话是罗隆基的政治路线的结晶。这种狂妄叫嚣的实质，就是要资产阶级来领导无产阶级。他们说，在建设社会主义的大前提下，共产党是最大的内行。解放八年来，我们在经济、文化、艺术、科学、技术各方面取得的辉煌成就，就是罗隆基也是“良心上不能不承认”的。但是我们要问罗隆基，这些成就是在谁的领导下取得的？难道是在“小资产阶级大知识分子”的领导下取得的吗？不是。这些辉煌成就是在工人阶级的先锋队——中国共产党的领导下取得的。
    冯友兰在会上说，罗隆基和他的小集团认为现在是“党天下”，他鼓动知识分子向党说：你要保持你的“党天下”，你就得买我知识分子的“才艺”，你就得“礼贤下士”，“三顾茅庐”，我有“反”你也不能“肃”，我有落后思想，你也不能改造，我是“士可杀不可辱”。罗隆基就是用这种方法鼓动落后的知识分子，迷惑中间的知识分子，让他们跟着章罗联盟走，与党对抗。在封建社会和资本主义社会里，知识分子永远是一个被雇用的阶层。今天，知识分子发挥自己的才能，建设社会主义，为工人农民服务，完全是为自己办事，并不是替别人办事；他们是主人，不是奴才，用不着讨价还价，无所谓“食王的爵禄报王的恩”，也无所谓“士为知己者死”。在这种情况下，知识分子才真不受“辱”，才真享受到尊严。
    充当反革命分子的“万家生佛”  公然进行破坏宪法的罪恶勾当
    会上，许多人还严历地驳斥了罗隆基在肃反、国家根本制度和“长期共存、互相监督”等问题上的种种谬论和阴谋，彻底揭露了章罗联盟利用民盟所进行的非法组织活动。
    龚祥瑞、王子泉、周新民、周叔迦、林仲易、陈重、芮沐、曹杰、黄艮庸的联合发言，在肃反问题上严厉地驳斥了罗隆基的各种反共谬论，揭穿了他的阴谋活动。他们指出，人民和罗隆基等一切右派分子在肃反问题上的根本分歧，就在于人民主张必须把一切反革命分子坚决、彻底、干净、全部肃清，以保卫人民革命的胜利果实，而罗隆基等右派分子却还是让他们“起来”，推翻人民民主政权，让帝国主义与蒋介石卷土重来。正因为如此，在5月22日中共中央统战部召开的座谈会上，罗隆基才以右派主帅的身份，提出成立“平反委员会”的主张，公开向反动分子发出一个“有什么委曲都来申诉”的反革命复辟的号召，妄图推翻过去我们肃清反革命分子的原案，而颠复人民民主专政。罗隆基在提出“平反委员会”的主张后不到一个月，就收到了一百七十多封信拥护他的“平反”主张，每封信里都充满了反革命造谣、诽谤和一片狂吠声。有的直言不讳地说“中国要变，而且变得有些想像不到的地步”。有的说“罗隆基先生的谈话和建议是‘万家生佛’的建议”、要他领导反革命分子“改造”共产党领导的中国。罗隆基这个野心家在收到这些正中其下怀的信后，就拿起笔来在这些恶毒的来信上批示说，“此事应由各界造成舆论，请向统战部和政协建议。”这就是右派分子头子罗隆基怂恿一切反革命分子起来造反的铁证。
    李国钧、王德滋、邓初民、池际尚、孙殿卿、邵循正、陈士骅、姜成文、高天、章名涛在大会上的联合发言中指出，章罗联盟的政治阴谋重点之一，就是妄想从国家组织形式入手来摆脱共产党的领导，取消人民民主专政，改变建立在民主集中制基础上的国家政权性质。罗隆基和章伯钧等右派分子在一起，千方百计地歪曲和诋毁我们国家的根本制度——人民代表大会制，并不讳言他至今“仍幻想在中国建立英美式的资本主义民主”，诬蔑社会主义人民民主制度“不民主”，不如资产阶级议会制度，完全赞同章伯钧所主张的“两院制”。资产阶级右派分子们把我们国家机关中的人民的政治一致性和全国高度的统一领导说成是“没有民主”，这是一种策略性的恶毒攻击。他们企图用“绝对民主”的观念来涣散劳动人民的意志，来瓦解劳动人民的组织性和战斗性。章伯钧、罗隆基等妄图建立所谓“政治设计院”和“平反委员会”，由右派分子们来决策、“平反”，篡夺整个国家的领导权，这是违反宪法和全民意志的罪恶行为。
    罗子为、吴征镒、汪世铭、张曼筠、张乔啬、吴克清、赵擎寰、熊伟的联合发言说，自从共产党提出“长期共存，互相监督”的方针后，罗隆基就积极布置民盟的恶性大发展，以扩大反动的社会基础，积累反动的政治资本，要和共产党“分庭抗礼，平分秋色”，妄图“保存资本主义的一线生机”，伺机复辟。他们指出：“长期共存、互相监督”的基础和前提就是走社会主义道路，接受共产党的领导。离开了这个基础和前提，根本就不可能长期共存，根本就谈不到互相监督。罗隆基和我们根本分歧，就在于他不要民主党派走社会主义道路，不要民主党派接受党的领导。他要以资本主义为基础，企图把民主党派变成资本主义国家多党政治中的反对党。
    吴昱恒、冯素陶、杨一波、沈一帆、褚圣麟、施洪熙、余胜椿、王麦初和薛博民在会上揭露，罗隆基和章罗联盟为了实现他们的罪恶目的，曾经利用民盟合法组织进行了一系列的非组织活动，篡夺盟内各级组织的领导实权，扩大右派势力，打击左派。1956年以后，这一活动发展到极其猖狂的程度。民盟第二次全国代表大会时期，罗隆基和章伯钧把他们右派集团中的许多亲信骨干都安排到中央委员和候补中央委员的职位上，垄断中央的领导实权到目前为止，全国盟员中的右派人数约占盟员总数的7％左右，而他们在中央委员中却占了全体委员的29％，在候补中央委员中占了43％，在中央常委中占了36％以上。章罗联盟并向各个重要地方布置他的右派小集团势力，夺取地方组织的领导权。据初步调查，民盟全国二十四个省（市）级地方组织中，为右派集团篡夺了全部领导实权的，有上海、四川、浙江、江西、湖北、湖南、安徽、广东、江苏、陕西等十个；大城市的县（市）级地方组织中，有武汉、重庆、济南、青岛、福州、杭州等六个。其中除安徽、重庆两个组织而外，其主委、副主委、秘书长多系右派分子。掌握这些组织实权的右派分子全部是与章罗联盟有组织关系或执行他们的政治路线和组织路线的右派骨干分子。
    他们说：罗隆基的联盟头子章伯钧在长期共存、互相监督的方针开始提出后就到处宣称民主党派要发展几百万人，给共产党一个颜色看。罗隆基认为被管制过的，和对各项运动不满的人都是民盟最好的发展对象，要把这些人都吸收进来。仅武汉市新发展的四百三十一个盟员中就有二百多人有严重的政治历史问题。上海有些基层发现的右派分子占60％以上，有的基层甚至100％有问题。
    罗隆基空洞承认罪恶很大  但仍抵赖章罗联盟具体活动
    罗隆基在23日的大会结束前作了所谓“交代”。他说，“我犯了反党、反社会主义的罪恶”，“我要向民盟、中央和全国人民认罪”。罗隆基承认，他曾经提出要组织“平反委员会”，反对肃反运动，这是他反党反人民反社会主义的最严重的罪行。他说，过去他对这个问题进行抵赖，是企图减轻他的罪恶。
    罗隆基承认，他的确阴谋在知识分子中抓领导权，以便造成力量同共产党对立。他说：“章罗联盟的一切活动都是围绕着这一阴谋进行的。”
    然而，罗隆基一方面承认他同章伯钧“有联盟”，他们“利用民盟的合法组织作了许多非法的事情”，“罪过比任何人都大”，另方面却矢口抵赖章罗联盟的具体活动。他一面承认这三次会上所揭露出来的事情“都是事实”，一方面又反齿抵赖说，有些事情是他“死也不能承认的”。同时，罗隆基对他的反动活动的具体事实一点也不肯交代。
    罗隆基这种百般抵赖、拒不交代的态度，引起了人们的极大愤怒。在罗隆基“交代”以后，不少人即席和他对证事实，揭露他的腐朽的资产阶级生活，严厉批判他企图继续进行狡辩的极不老实的态度。到会的人再一次警告罗隆基：不老实交代罪行，决不能获得人民的宽大。
    最后，大会执行主席宣布：大会还将继续举行。
