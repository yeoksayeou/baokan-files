Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Cairo: The Algerian National Liberation Front's Cairo office issued a statement on November 30, condemning the so-called "Fundamental Law" on Algeria passed by the French National Assembly as an attempt to divide Algeria. The National Liberation Front cannot consider such a law.

The statement said: "The Algerian people have taken up arms to fight for an Algeria with complete sovereignty and independence -- a complete and indivisible Algeria," but "the Fundamental Law" cannot solve this "fundamental problem."

Another New York dispatch: A delegation of the Algerian National Liberation Front issued a statement in New York on the 29th, accusing the "Fundamental Law" on Algeria passed by the French Parliament of hindering the peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue because "it cuts off any hope for Algeria to achieve independence."

The statement also said: "The ultimate desire of the Algerian people is national liberation. Declaring Algeria an inseparable part of the French Republic means not allowing Algerians to take any action to obtain independence."

Xinhua News Agency, December 1st: New York dispatch: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued to discuss the Algerian issue on November 30.

Syrian representative Zeineddine, in his speech, asked the United Nations to recommend that the French authorities and the Algerian people's organizations conduct direct negotiations so that Algeria could obtain freedom. He pointed out that the basis for such negotiations should be the recognition of Algeria's independence.

Zeineddine said that Algerians had tried to persuade France to recognize their right to independence, but France refused. France's current attitude has not changed, and it continues to try to solve the Algerian problem through violence. The French government refuses or circumvents genuine negotiations, blocking the road to peaceful development.

Zeineddine said that if the United Nations does not take action to promote negotiations between the two sides, some member states may independently recognize Algeria's independence.

British representative Noble defended France's colonialist position. He insisted that the Algerian issue had "made progress" and that it was an internal affair of France.

After a brief speech by French Foreign Minister Pineau, the committee decided to adjourn.

　　阿解放阵线坚持国家独立
　  指责法国民议会通过“根本法”
    叙代表要求联合国促进法阿直接谈判
    据新华社讯　开罗消息：阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线开罗办事处11月30日发表声明，谴责法国国民议会通过的所谓阿尔及利亚“根本法”是企图分裂阿尔及利亚。民族解放阵线不可能考虑这样一个法律。
    声明说：“阿尔及利亚人民拿起了武器，为的是争取一个有完整的主权和独立的阿尔及利亚——一个完整而不可分割的阿尔及利亚”，但是，“根本法”却不能解决这个“根本的问题”。
    另据纽约消息：阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线代表团29日在纽约发表声明，指责法国议会通过的阿尔及利亚“根本法”阻碍了阿尔及利亚问题的和平解决，因为“它杜绝了阿尔及利亚实现独立的任何希望”。
    声明还说：“阿尔及利亚人民的最终愿望就是民族解放。宣称阿尔及利亚是法兰西共和国不可分割的部分就是不许阿尔及利亚人为获取独立而采取任何行动。”
    新华社1日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会11月30日继续讨论阿尔及利亚问题。
    叙利亚代表宰尼丁在发言中要求联合国建议法国当局和阿尔及利亚人民的组织进行直接谈判，以使阿尔及利亚得到自由。他指出，这种谈判的基础应该是承认阿尔及利亚的独立。
    宰尼丁说，阿尔及利亚人曾经设法说服法国承认他们的独立权利，可是法国拒绝了。法国目前的态度仍然没有改变，它继续试图通过暴力来解决阿尔及利亚问题。法国政府拒绝或者规避真正的谈判，堵塞了通往和平发展的道路。
    宰尼丁说，如果联合国不采取促进双方谈判的行动，一些会员国有可能独自承认阿尔及利亚的独立。
    英国代表诺布耳为法国的殖民主义立场辩护。他硬说阿尔及利亚问题已经“取得进展”，并且说阿尔及利亚问题是法国的一个内政问题。
    在法国外交部长比诺作了简短发言后，委员会决定休会。
