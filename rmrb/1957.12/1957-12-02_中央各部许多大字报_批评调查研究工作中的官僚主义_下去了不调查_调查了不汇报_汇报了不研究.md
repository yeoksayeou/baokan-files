Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch: Some big-character posters put up in central departments criticize some leaders of ministries, departments, and bureaus for treating investigation and research work with a bureaucratic attitude, wasting manpower and financial resources, and causing losses to work.

According to the criticisms in the big-character posters, some leaders seem to attach great importance to investigation and research and often send people down to understand the situation, but no one cares about the people who are sent down after they return. A big-character poster from the Grain Production Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture stated: The four work groups sent by the bureau to several provinces this year to investigate the potential for increased production have been back for more than four months, but no report has been called for until the big-character poster was put up. Several people from the Seed Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture said in a big-character poster: The materials they brought back from the countryside are often "archived for the record" and not fully digested and utilized. A big-character poster from the Cadre Department of the Ministry of Coal Industry revealed that in 1956, the department sent six or seven cadres to coal mines across the country to investigate the situation of cadres, which took four or five months, but no report has been made to this day. Two cadres from the Labor and Wage Department of the Ministry of Construction Engineering said in a big-character poster: In order to compile the correction coefficient of labor quotas for winter and rainy season construction, they were sent to Changchun in May 1955 to understand the situation. After returning, they wanted to report to the section chief, but the section chief repeatedly postponed it. Finally, when the representatives from various places studying this issue had already come to Beijing for a meeting, they had to be exempted from reporting. In December of the same year, they were sent to Anshan Iron and Steel to participate in the compilation of installation engineering quotas, which lasted two and a half months. After returning, they asked to report to the division chief, but the division chief only wanted written materials and did not listen to the report. It is not known whether the written materials were studied.

Some leaders listen to reports from cadres who have gone down or read the materials they have written, but they do not seriously study the problems, nor do they solve them. A big-character poster from the Education Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture stated: Their bureau has done a relatively large amount of investigation and research in the countryside, but they rarely seriously analyze the survey data, and even less issue circulars, instructions, or articles in response to the problems found in the countryside to promote and improve agricultural education. A big-character poster from the Accounting Department of the Second Ministry of Machine Building stated: After the people sent to the factory to check the work reported the problems they found, the leadership did not seriously study them and make a clear conclusion to deal with them.

The big-character posters also revealed that some leaders do not go deep enough when they go down to understand the situation and check the work, and some even use the name of checking the work to travel and play. A big-character poster from the Machinery Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture revealed that when the bureau director Zhang Zijing led a core group to the countryside last year to investigate the issue of agricultural mechanization, he spent forty days traveling through five provinces including Heilongjiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, and nine cities including Harbin, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Shanghai, but he did not write a single word after returning. The big-character poster wrote: Zhang Zijing's work in the countryside was completely superficial and perfunctory, and he never conducted down-to-earth investigation and research. In forty days, he only listened to two hours of reports in one place, and the rest were symbolic glances or short reports before leaving. When he arrived at the Shanghai Xijiao Tractor Station, the people in the car had not all gotten out yet, and Zhang Zijing turned around and said, let's go, it's enough to know the location of the station. On the other hand, Zhang Zijing was extremely interested in traveling and sightseeing. For example, in order to appreciate the scenic spots of Lushan and Gusu, he used the excuse of going to Jiujiang and Suzhou, but he only stopped at the Jiujiang Tractor Station for a short time, and spent a whole day sightseeing in Lushan. When he arrived in Suzhou, he did not go to the Tractor Station at all, and all his time was spent immersed in the mountains and rivers of "Liuyuan" and "Lion Grove." The masses gave him a couplet saying: "Skimming the surface, taking a fleeting look; traveling and sightseeing, boasting about officialdom for thousands of miles."

    中央各部许多大字报
　　批评调查研究工作中的官僚主义
    ·下去了不调查·调查了不汇报·汇报了不研究·
    据新华社30日讯　中央各部门贴出的一些大字报，批评了有些部、司、局领导人员用官僚主义态度对待调查研究工作，浪费了人力和财力，给工作带来了损失。
    据大字报批评，有些领导人员好像很重视调查研究，经常派人下去了解情况，但是派下去的人回来以后却无人过问。农业部粮食生产局的大字报说：今年局里派往几个省调查增产潜力的四个工作组，已经回来了四个多月，但是，一直到出大字报时还没有召集汇报。农业部种子局的几个人在大字报上说：他们下乡带回来的材料，往往被“存档备案”，没有被充分消化利用。煤炭部干部司的大字报揭露，1956年司里派了六七个干部到全国各煤矿调查干部情况，花了四五个月时间，但直到现在没有汇报成。建筑工程部劳资司两个干部出的大字报说：为了编制冬季施工和雨季施工劳动定额修正系数，1955年5月他们被派到长春去了解情况，回来后要向科长汇报，但科长一再展期，直到研究这个问题的各地代表已来京开会，最后只好免予汇报。同年12月，他们又被派往鞍钢参加编制安装工程定额，历时两个半月，回来后要求给处长汇报，但处长只要了书面材料，不听汇报，书面材料是否研究了也不知道。
    有些领导人员虽然也听取下去的干部汇报或看他们写的材料，但是却不认真研究问题，也不解决问题。农业部教育局的大字报说：他们局里下乡调查研究作得比较多，但是却很少对调查资料认真地进行分析研究，更少针对下乡中发现的问题发表通报、指示或文章，来推动和改进农业教育工作。第二机械工业部会计司的大字报说：派到工厂检查工作的人回来把检查出来的问题汇报了，领导上也不认真研究，作出肯定的结论予以处理。
    大字报还揭露有些领导人到下面去了解情况检查工作时很不深入，甚至有人借检查工作之名游山玩水。农业部机械局的大字报揭露，局长张子敬去年带领一个核心组下乡调查农业机械化问题时，用了四十天时间，走了黑龙江、安徽、江西等五个省和哈尔滨、南京、苏州、上海等九个城市，回来以后一个字也没有写。大字报写道：张子敬下乡工作完全是走马观花、蜻蜓点水，从未踏踏实实调查研究。四十天中只在一个地方听过两小时汇报，其他都是象征性的看一下或听一下汇报就走了。到上海西郊拖拉机站时，汽车上的人还没有全部下车，张子敬就转身说，走吧，知道一下站址就行了。另一方面，张子敬对游山玩水却极感兴趣。如为欣赏庐山和姑苏名胜，借口到了九江和苏州，但是在九江拖拉机站只停了很短一段时间，到庐山却逛了一整天。到苏州根本没有到拖拉机站，全部时间都沉醉在“留园”和“师子林”等山水之间。群众赠他一副对联说：“蜻蜓点水，走马看花；游山玩景，万里夸官。”
