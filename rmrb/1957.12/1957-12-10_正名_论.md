　　On "Rectifying Names"
　　Yu Linchang
　　Recently, with the opening of the Yangtze River Bridge to traffic, the Ministry of Railways specifically issued an order to rename the Yuehan and Jinghan Railways as the Jingguang Railway, which I think is very good. This made me think of the fact that many of our country's railways, highways, and other names are not entirely reasonable and should be corrected accordingly while vigorously improving our work.
　　As for railway names, many are consistent with reality, such as the Jingbao Railway, the Shenshan Railway, and the Jinpu Railway, all of which use the starting and ending points as naming standards, so people with a little geographical knowledge can understand them at a glance, and those who don't know can understand them with a single explanation.
　　However, some railway names use the names of two provinces, such as the Xianggui Railway, which actually refers to the section from Hengyang in Hunan to Munanguan in Guangxi, and the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway under construction, which refers to the section from Chongqing to Guiyang; other examples include the Xiangqian Railway and the Zhegan Railway. These railway names make it confusing to know where they start and end. At the same time, if these provinces build new railways in the future, naming them will become a problem. Wouldn't it be better to rename the Xianggui Railway as the Hengmu Railway and the Qiangui Railway as the Guiliu Railway?
　　There are also some railways whose naming is even more illogical, such as the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway under construction. "Lan" is "Lanzhou," and "Xin" is "Xinjiang," one is a city name, and the other is a province name, which is very asymmetrical. Other examples include the Ninggan Railway (Nanjing to Guixi, Jiangxi) and the Lanqing Railway (Lanzhou to Mang'ai in the Qaidam Basin, Qinghai), which are also like this. Also, the Kangzang Highway runs from Ya'an to Lhasa. Since Xikang Province was abolished, Ya'an has been assigned to Sichuan, so it should be renamed the Sichuan-Tibet Highway or the Ya'la Highway. In addition, some railways still use ancient place names, which are also outdated. For example, why can't the Longhai Railway be called the Lanhai Railway?

### “正名”论

　　“正名”论
　　俞林昌
    最近，因为长江大桥通车，铁道部特发布命令，把粤汉、京汉两铁路改名为京广铁路，我认为很好。由此我又联想到我国还有很多铁路、公路以及其他的名称，也不尽合理，应该在这大力改进工作的同时，分别改正。
    就铁路名称来说，很多名实相符，如京包路、沈山路、津浦路等等，都是以起讫点作为命名的标准，所以稍具地理常识的人，一看便知，不知道的人，也一说便懂。
    但有的铁路名称，则是以两个省区名称来命名的，如湘桂路，实际上系指湖南的衡阳到广西的睦南关，又如正在建设中的川黔路，系指重庆到贵阳这一段；此外如湘黔路、浙赣路等也都是如此。像这些铁路名称，究竟系从那里开始？到达那里？就令人费解。同时如这些省区将来再建筑新的铁路，命名也就发生问题了。如湘桂路改称衡睦路，黔桂路改称贵柳路，这样不是很好吗？
    还有一些铁路，命名更不合乎逻辑，如正在建设中的兰新路，“兰”是“兰州”，“新”是“新疆”，一个是城市名称，一个是省区名称，很不对称，此外如正在建设的宁赣路（南京至江西贵溪）、兰青路（兰州至青海柴达木盆地茫厓），也是这样。又如康藏公路，系从雅安到拉萨，自西康省撤消以后，雅安已划归四川，所以应改为川藏公路，或雅拉公路。此外，有些铁路还采用古地名，也不合时宜。如陇海铁路，就叫兰海铁路又有什么不可呢？
