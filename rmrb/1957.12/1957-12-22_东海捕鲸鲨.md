    Catching a Whale Shark in the East China Sea

    Some time ago, the aquatic production cooperative, transferred from Fuding County, Fujian Province, to Zhejiang for production, caught a rare large shark (known as a toad shark by fishermen, i.e., a whale shark) in the East China Sea. This large shark was 27.5 Chinese feet long, 3.4 Chinese feet high, and weighed 10,820 catties. It is the first time that such a large shark has been discovered in the Zhoushan Islands and the East China Sea area. The Zhejiang Provincial Museum sent staff to prepare to transport the shark to Hangzhou for exhibition, but the fish was too bulky to retrieve.

    The fishermen put in a great effort to catch this large shark. They let out more than 40 meters of hook rope, but when the hook rope was slowly being retrieved and only about ten meters were left, the shark suddenly turned around and tried to escape. This turn caused the hook rope to become entangled with the sampan, capsizing the small boat, and all four people fell into the sea. Fortunately, the fishermen were skilled swimmers and were not in danger. They jumped onto another small sampan and continued their work. After five or six hours of fighting with the large shark, the shark became exhausted and floated to the surface of the sea. The fishermen used a large coir rope to tie the shark's gills and mouth and sailed it back along the water's surface.

    东海捕鲸鲨
    前些日子，由福建福鼎县转移到浙江生产的水产社，在东海捕到了一条稀有的大鲨鱼（渔民叫它蛤蟆鲨，即鲸鲨）。这条大鲨身长二丈七尺五寸，体高三尺四寸，体重一万零八百二十斤，是舟山群岛和东海区首次发现的大鲨鱼。浙江省博物馆曾派工作人员准备把大鲨运往杭州展览，但因鱼体笨重等原因未能起回。
    渔民们在捕捉这条大鲨鱼的时候，是费了很大气力的，钩绳放了四十多公尺长，但当钩绳慢慢地往回收只剩十多公尺的时候，大鲨猛然掉转了身又想潜逃。这一掉转，钩绳缠住了舢板，把小舢板都弄翻了，四个人都掉下了海。幸亏渔民们水性熟练，没有受险。他们跳上了另外的小舢板又继续工作。同大鲨鱼经过五、六个钟头的战斗，大鲨精疲力竭后，才从海水中层浮了上来。渔民们用了一根大棕绳拴住鲨鱼的鳃和嘴，顺着水面扬帆拖回。
