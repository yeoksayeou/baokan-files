　　The newspaper published a report from Soasiu, the capital of West Irian, stating that since the beginning of 1957, the Dutch colonialist army has begun to use the air force to bomb and strafe the people of West Irian who are fighting against Dutch rule. However, places like Maloki, Sorong and Hollandia in West Irian, which have always been regarded as "safe" and "orderly" by the Dutch colonialists, are now found to be the central areas of activity for the people's forces fighting for the liberation of West Irian.

　　Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, December 13th: The Dutch Peace Council demanded on the 12th that the Dutch government immediately take the initiative to discuss the West Irian issue with Indonesia.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, December 13th: Otto Fenga, manager of the Orangery Brewing Company, a Dutch-owned company in Jakarta, said in Hong Kong on the 11th that the Dutch in Indonesia believe that the Dutch government has no reason not to return West Irian to Indonesia.

　　Otto Fenga told Hong Kong newspaper reporters that he did not understand why the Dutch government had to occupy West Irian. He believes that it would be better for the Netherlands to return West Irian to Indonesia. The general Dutch people living in Indonesia also have this opinion. He said that the Dutch government should immediately negotiate with Indonesia to find a solution to the problem.

　　西伊里安人民的斗争日益加强
    荷兰和理会要求政府同印度尼西亚谈判
    新华社雅加达12日电　据“伊里安邮报”报道，自从西伊里安省成立以来，尽管荷兰殖民主义者进行了残暴的镇压，西伊里安人民争取民族独立的运动仍然一直在不断地加强。
    这家报纸刊载西伊里安首府索阿修的消息说，自从1957年年初以来，荷兰殖民主义者的军队就开始使用空军，轰炸和扫射为反对荷兰的统治而进行战斗的西伊里安人民。但是，像西伊里安的马老奇、梭弄和荷兰蒂亚这些在荷兰殖民主义者看来一向是“安全”和“秩序良好”的地方，现在也都发现是为解放西伊里安而斗争的人民部队活动的中心地区。
    新华社13日讯　海牙消息：荷兰和平理事会12日要求荷兰政府立即采取主动同印度尼西亚讨论西伊里安问题。
    理事会还坚决要求政府摈弃任何使用武力的想法。
    新华社香港13日电　雅加达荷兰资本的奥兰日酿酒有限公司的经理奥托芬加11日在香港说，在印度尼西亚的荷兰人都认为，荷兰政府没有理由不把西伊里安交还给印度尼西亚。
    奥托芬加对香港的报纸记者说，他不明白为什么荷兰政府一定要占有西伊里安。他认为，荷兰还是把西伊里安还给印度尼西亚的好。居住在印度尼西亚的一般荷兰人也都有这样的意见。他说，荷兰政府应该立即同印度尼西亚进行谈判，找出问题的解决办法。
