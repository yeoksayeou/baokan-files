Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 18th: American newspapers are increasingly voicing calls for the US government to seriously consider Bulganin's proposals.

　　American columnist Walter Lippmann, in an article in the "New York Herald Tribune," accused Dulles of "mechanically and unthinkingly" rejecting Soviet peace proposals in "the same old way."

　　Lippmann wrote that the Soviet Union "proposes to establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe—two Germanys, Poland and Czechoslovakia. This is a very popular proposition. Undoubtedly, most Germans, including West Germany, would support it."

　　He said, "The Soviet proposal to conclude an agreement on limited and partial disarmament is in the vital interests of the German people. Such an agreement would also be met with very broad and deep sympathy throughout Europe, and it is in line with the idea that a unified Germany is best not to become a nuclear weapons state."

　　Lippmann believes that the Soviet proposal "can serve as a basis for negotiation."

　　John S. Knight, publisher of the "Chicago Daily News," published an article in his own newspaper opposing the State Department's quick dismissal of Bulganin's letters.

　　He wrote: The "satellite" era forces us to understand a serious fact: military superiority no longer belongs to us.

　　Knight said: America's "current belligerent attitude is contrary to reason and will lead to conflict. Shouldn't we re-examine our policies? Shouldn't we abandon that unhelpful policy and replace it with a policy of wholeheartedly consolidating peace by relying on friendship and mutual understanding?"

　　Knight said: "Whether we like it or not, we must recognize the existence of Russia and the communist countries, and they will continue to exist, and they are dominant in terms of territory, resources and population."

　　The "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" published an editorial criticizing the State Department's virtual rejection of Bulganin's proposals, and the newspaper called for a serious study of these proposals.

　　The newspaper wrote: "When Bulganin proposed a halt to nuclear testing starting January 1, many people around the world supported him."

　　The newspaper also believes that Bulganin's proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe could allow "both sides to benefit greatly from this agreement."

　　The "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" also called for consideration of "reducing or completely withdrawing troops from the two Germanys and certain countries in Eastern and Western Europe."

　　It concluded: "It is becoming increasingly clear that the proposals that the United States is preparing to put forward at the NATO meeting are overwhelmingly military in nature. However, it is understood that there is a willingness among our allies to negotiate with the Soviet Union."

　　William Stringer, Washington Bureau Chief of "The Christian Science Monitor," called for the United States to work to break the deadlock in East-West relations and stop the increasingly dangerous arms race.

　　Stringer said: "Bulganin's letter can provide new opportunities... Shouldn't the United States answer that the United States agrees to the temporary cessation of nuclear weapons testing as suggested in the letter? Shouldn't the United States agree to convene the proposed high-level meeting on the condition that a meeting of foreign ministers first proves it possible to choose a beneficial agenda? Shouldn't the United States agree to future consultations on the German question and study the issue of establishing a demilitarized zone, or at least a zone without nuclear weapons, in Central Europe?"

　　The "Des Moines Register" published an editorial entitled "Dulles' 'No' Was Too Quick," criticizing the US Secretary of State for taking a negative attitude towards the Soviet proposals.

　　Reuters' Washington correspondent said: "A view is gradually forming that immediately rejecting Mr. Bulganin's proposals may seriously disadvantage the West in the eyes of the world." He said: "Those who used to think, and still think, that Mr. Bulganin's proposals are propaganda measures to undermine the North Atlantic Alliance also say today that such proposals cannot be ignored."

### 美国舆论不满政府死硬政策  要求认真考虑苏联和平建议

　　美国舆论不满政府死硬政策  要求认真考虑苏联和平建议
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：美国报纸上越来越多地出现了要求美国政府认真考虑布尔加宁的建议的呼声。
    美国专栏作家李普曼在“纽约先驱论坛报”发表一篇文章，指责杜勒斯“老一套地、机械地和毫不思索地”拒绝苏联的和平建议。
    李普曼写道，苏联“提议在中欧——两个德国、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克建立免除核武器地区。这是非常得人心的主张。无疑，大多数德国人，包括西德在内，会支持这种主张。”
    他说，“苏联提议缔结关于有限制和局部的裁军协定符合德国人民的切身利益。这种协定也将获得整个欧洲非常广泛和深刻的同情，它符合这样的想法：统一的德国最好不要变为核武器国家。”
    李普曼认为，苏联的建议“能够作为谈判的基础”。
    “芝加哥每日新闻”发行人奈特在他自己的报上发表一篇文章，反对国务院很快地把布尔加宁的信件丢在一边。
    他写道：“卫星”时代迫使我们了解到一个严重的事实：军事优越已经不属于我们了。
    奈特说：美国“目前的好战态度是同理智背道而驰的，它将导致冲突。难道我们不应当重新审查我们的政策？难道我们不应当抛弃那种无益的政策，而代之以依靠友谊和互相谅解来全心全意地巩固和平的政策吗？”
    奈特说：“不管我们高兴还是不高兴，我们都必须承认俄国和共产主义国家的存在，而且还要存在下去，它们在领土、资源和人口方面都占优势。”
    “圣路易邮报”发表了一篇社论，抨击国务院实际上拒绝了布尔加宁的建议，报纸要求认真地研究这些建议。
    报纸写道：“当布尔加宁提出从1月1日起停止核试验的时候，全世界有许多人都支持他。”
    这家报纸还认为，布尔加宁关于建立中欧免除核武器地区的建议能够使“双方都从这个协定中得到很多好处”。
    “圣路易邮报”还要求考虑“裁减或者完全从两个德国和东西欧某些国家撤退军队的问题。”
    它最后指出：“美国准备在北大西洋公约组织会议上提出的建议绝大多数都具有军事性质这一点已经越来越明显了。但是，据了解，在我们的盟国中间存在着愿意同苏联谈判的倾向。”
    “基督教科学箴言报”驻华盛顿分社社长威廉·斯特林格要求美国努力消除东西方关系中的僵局和停止愈来愈危险的军备竞赛。
    斯特林格说：“布尔加宁的信能提供新的好机会……难道美国就不能回答说美国同意信中所建议的暂时停止核武器的试验吗？难道美国就不能同意在首先由各国外交部长会议证明有可能选择有益的议程的条件下召开所建议的高级会议吗？难道美国就不能同意今后对德国问题进行协商和研究在欧洲中部建立非军事化地带，或者至少是不设置核武器的地带的问题吗？”
    “得梅因纪事报”以“杜勒斯的‘不’说的太快了”为题，发表社论指责美国国务卿对苏联的建议采取否定的态度。
    路透社驻华盛顿的记者说：“人们逐渐形成的一种看法认为立即拒绝布尔加宁先生的建议的做法在世人心目中可能严重地不利于西方。”他说：“那些过去认为，现在仍旧认为布尔加宁先生的建议是破坏北大西洋联盟的宣传措施的人今天也说这种建议不容忽视。”
