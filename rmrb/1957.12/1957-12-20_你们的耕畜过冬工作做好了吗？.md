    Have You Done a Good Job on Wintering Your Draft Animals?
    Liu Baifeng
    Soon it will be the "Winter Solstice," and most parts of our country will enter the cold winter season. Currently, there is a pressing task that agricultural cooperatives in various regions need to pay attention to – protecting draft animals to ensure they safely survive the winter.
    After the beginning of winter, rural areas enter a winter production upsurge focused on water conservancy construction and manure accumulation, with the majority of the workforce being invested in water conservancy construction and manure accumulation movements. Because of this, some agricultural cooperatives can easily overlook the work of protecting and caring for draft animals (or other tasks). In order to protect draft animals to ensure they safely survive the winter, it is very necessary to seize the opportunity to conduct an inspection of the draft animal protection and care situation.
    Recently, various regions in Hunan Province conducted a general inspection of the draft animal protection and care situation. The results of the inspection revealed that in Ningyuan County, 70% of the areas did not have feed for draft cattle to survive the winter this year; the phenomenon of missing doors and cracked walls in cattle pens was widespread in Pingjiang County; in the four townships of Yuanling Taichang Village, 8.8% of the 1,072 draft cattle did not have pens; in Yunxi Township of Linxiang County, 60 out of 97 cattle in Xinmin Agricultural Cooperative spent the night under large trees on earthen embankments, and 20 cattle were left unattended in the threshing ground; in many places, herds of cattle often ran around day and night, with no one managing them. Due to the lack of concern for draft cattle and poor protection and care, the phenomena of draft cattle deaths and loss of condition in these areas are also alarming. According to the statistics from one township in Chenxi alone, over 30% of the 191 draft cattle in the entire township had serious loss of condition. The widespread and serious existence of these phenomena in Hunan Province is, on the one hand, due to the insufficient understanding of the importance of loving and protecting livestock among cooperative members, and more importantly, the lack of dedicated personnel responsible for draft animal protection and care. Although some agricultural cooperatives have also formulated draft animal feeding management systems and cattle protection organizations, these systems and organizations have become mere formalities because no one pays attention to them.
    Whether there is sufficient animal power to ensure the smooth completion of next year's spring plowing tasks and the smooth progress of agricultural production throughout the year depends primarily on how well the draft animal protection and care work is done this winter. In the current situation of relatively scarce animal power, it is particularly necessary to strengthen the physical strength of draft animals as much as possible. Failure to pay attention to this in winter will make the shortage of animal power even more acute when agricultural work becomes busy in the spring, and it is also easy for deaths to occur due to excessive labor.
    For the sake of long-term interests, the current work of protecting and caring for draft animals should not be neglected. Vigorously developing draft animals is an indispensable condition for achieving the targets stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). The development of draft animals is premised on protection and care. Only by raising draft animals to be strong and healthy, with female animals not failing to conceive, can there be a basis for the development of draft animals. Otherwise, vigorously developing draft animals will become an empty slogan.

### 你们的耕畜过冬工作做好了吗？

    你们的耕畜过冬工作做好了吗？
    刘柏枫
    很快就到“冬至”，我国大部地区就要进入隆冬季节。目前各地农业社有一个迫切需要注意的工作——保护耕畜安全过冬。
    入冬以后，农村进入了以兴修水利、积肥为主的冬季生产高潮，绝大部分力量都投入了兴修水利和积肥运动。这样，有些农业社就很容易忽略耕畜护养工作（或其它）。为了保护耕畜安全过冬，抓紧时机对耕畜护养情况进行一次检查是非常必要的。
    湖南省各地最近对耕畜护养情况普遍进行了一次检查，检查的结果，发现宁远县今年有70％地区的耕牛没有饲料过冬；平江县牛栏缺门和墙壁破缝的现象普遍存在；沅陵太常村等四个乡，一千零七十二头耕牛中有8.8％的牛没有栏；临湘县云溪乡新民农业社九十七头牛中，有六十头牛在大树下土墈边过夜，二十头牛放在禾场上无人过问；许多地方白天黑夜常有成群的牛东冲西跑，没人管理。由于对耕牛不关心，护养不善，这些地区耕牛死亡和退膘的现象也是惊人的。仅辰溪一个乡的统计，全乡一百九十一头耕牛中，就有30％以上的牛有严重退膘现象。湖南省这些现象的普遍严重存在，一方面固然是社员们对爱畜护畜的重要意义认识不足，而更重要的一个方面是耕畜护养工作没有专人负责。有些农业社虽然也制订了耕畜饲养管理制度和护牛组织，但因为无人过问，这些制度和组织也都流于形式了。
    是否有足够的畜力保证明年春耕任务顺利完成，保证明年全年农业生产顺利进行，首先就要看今冬耕畜护养工作作得如何。在目前畜力比较缺乏的情况下，特别需要尽可能增强耕畜的体力。在冬季不注意这一点，春季农事一忙，就会更感畜力缺乏，也容易发生役使过度而死亡的现象。
    为长远的利益着想，也不可忽视当前的耕畜护养工作。大力发展耕畜，是达到农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的指标的一个必不可缺的条件。耕畜的发展是以护养为前提的，只有把耕畜养得膘肥体壮，母畜不空怀，耕畜才有发展的基础，否则，大力发展耕畜，就会成为一句空洞的口号。
    你们那个地方的耕畜过冬工作做得如何？及早检查一下吧！
