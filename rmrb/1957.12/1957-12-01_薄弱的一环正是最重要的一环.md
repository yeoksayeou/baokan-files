　　Dün County, in the rural rectification movement, first concentrated its efforts on rectifying a number of backward co-ops (weak co-ops). This approach is very good, and this is very necessary.

　　The characteristics of backward co-ops are: weak Party leadership; thin political atmosphere; problems with the ideology and work style of cadres; the dominant influence of capitalist ideology; and more active illegal landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries. As a result, production is not good, business management is chaotic, and mutual benefit policies are also not well implemented. The problems of these co-ops are truly numerous and complex.

　　Some comrades, faced with this situation, sigh and hesitate. They "walk around the backward co-ops" and dare not go to them. This is completely not the attitude that a revolutionary should take. In fact, from a global perspective, first concentrating the main force to rectify the backward co-ops is a method that requires less effort and yields greater results. This spring, the gust of wind of "trouble in the co-ops" originated in the backward co-ops. When the backward co-ops become better, the atmosphere of the entire countryside will change greatly. In the process of rectifying backward co-ops, relatively rich experience can also be gained, and then it will be easier to do a good job in the overall rectification work.

　　Some comrades have a fixed view of backward co-ops, believing that they are riddled with holes and incurable. This is a manifestation of a lack of mass perspective and a lack of in-depth understanding of the actual situation. Although these co-ops seem "chaotic" on the surface, in reality, only a small number of people are undermining and opposing the socialist cause, while the vast majority of the masses support cooperation and socialism, and the vast majority of cadres are willing to do their jobs well. As long as we follow the mass line, mobilize and rely on the strength of the basic masses, the face of backward co-ops can definitely be changed.

　　Backward co-ops have both class contradictions and the struggle between two roads, and many specific problems need to be rectified and improved. However, in many areas, only destructive activities have been cracked down on, and capitalist ideas have been attacked. Some cadres, seeing that righteousness has overwhelmed evil, are satisfied with the superficial phenomenon of "peace and tranquility" and have not immediately mobilized the masses to actively carry out rectification. Doing so means not carrying out the nationwide rectification movement to the end. Without conscientious rectification, agricultural co-ops will still not be consolidated, and backward co-ops will still be in a backward state. Neither shrink back, nor give up halfway; backward co-ops must be rectified, and they will certainly be rectified well.

### 薄弱的一环正是最重要的一环

    薄弱的一环正是最重要的一环
    惇县在农村整风运动中，首先集中力量整顿了一批落后社（薄弱社）。这种做法很好，这样做很必要。
    落后社的特点是：党的领导薄弱；政治空气不浓；干部思想、作风有问题；资本主义思想影响占优势；不法地主富农和反革命分子较活跃。因而生产搞得不好，经营管理混乱，互利政策也执行得不好。这些社的问题真是既多而又复杂。
    有些同志面对这种情况，唉声叹气，裹足不前。他们“绕着落后社走”，不敢到落后社去。这完全不是革命者应该采取的态度。其实，从全局来看，先集中主要力量把落后社整顿好，倒是费力小而收效大的办法。今年春天有些地方“闹社”的一股风，正是以落后社为发源地吹出来的。落后社变好了，整个农村的空气都会随之大变。在整顿落后社当中，也能取得比较丰富的经验，然后要做好全面整社工作就比较容易了。
    有的同志对落后社有一种固定的看法，认为它千疮百孔，无药可医。这是缺乏群众观点、没有深入地了解实际情况的表现。这些社表面上虽然“乱七八糟”，实际上，破坏和反对社会主义事业的只是少数人，而绝大多数群众是拥护合作化，拥护社会主义的，绝大多数干部是愿意把工作做好的。只要走群众路线，发动和依靠基本群众的力量，落后社的面貌一定能够改变。
    落后社既有阶级矛盾和两条道路的斗争，更有很多具体问题需要整顿和改进。但是，在不少地区，只是打击了一下破坏活动、进攻了一番资本主义思想，一些干部看到正气已经压倒邪气，便满足于“太平无事”的表面现象，而没有紧接着发动群众积极进行整改。这样做，就是没有把全民整风运动进行到底。不认真进行整改，农业社仍然是不会巩固的，落后社仍然会处在落后状态。既不要畏缩不前，也不要半途而废；落后社一定要整顿好，也一定能整顿好。
