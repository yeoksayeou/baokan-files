Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 5th: The Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory comprehensively and ahead of schedule fulfilled the state plan and the increased production and conservation plan for this year, 38 days ahead of time. The total output value, labor productivity, profits delivered to the state, and product targets (including locomotives, freight cars, locomotive wheels, and freight car wheels) listed in the plan were all completed two months to 38 days ahead of schedule. As of the end of November, the factory had overfulfilled its annual savings plan of 1.7 million yuan by 40%.

This factory has consistently adhered to the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results throughout this year. The entire factory has continuously carried out an advanced producer movement centered on increasing production and practicing economy. Organizing technical demonstrations and promoting advanced experiences have become mass habits. From January to October, more than 23,100 people participated in technical demonstrations, and more than 80 advanced experiences were promoted. The electric furnace steelmaking process, which had long failed to meet targets, saw its efficiency increase by 50% and the service life of the steel furnace extended fourfold after the quick steelmaking experience was promoted. More than 90% of the factory's production teams have formulated indicators including work-hour quotas, quality, and cost, and have insisted on a system of summarizing every ten days and making monthly evaluations. Many workshop workers organized "waste and old material recycling groups." The utilization rate of old timber in the dismantling workshop reached 50%, saving more than 1,000 cubic meters of timber in ten months.

　　既全面　又超额
　　太原机车车辆修理厂生产大开花
    据新华社太原5日电　太原机车车辆修理厂提前三十八天全面超额完成了今年的国家计划和增产节约计划。列入计划的总产值、劳动生产率、上缴利润和产品指标（包括机车、货车、机车轮、货车轮）都提前两个月到三十八天完成了。截至11月底，全厂超额40％完成了全年一百七十万元的节约计划。
    这个厂今年以来，一直坚持了全面贯彻多快好省的方针。全厂持续地开展了以增产节约为中心内容的先进生产者运动。组织技术表演、推广先进经验已成为群众性的习惯。1至10月份，全厂参加技术表演的达二万三千一百余人次，推行了八十多种先进经验。过去长期不能达到指标的电炉炼钢工序，在推行了快速炼钢经验以后，效率提高了50％，钢炉使用时间延长了四倍。全厂90％以上的生产小组都制定了包括工时定额、质量和成本等指标，并且坚持了按旬作小结、按月评比制度。许多车间工人组织了“废料旧料回收小组”。解体车间的旧木料利用率达到50％，十个月节约了一千余立方公尺的木材。
