The Beijing Amateur Urban Construction College is developing. This new type of college has three majors: "Water Supply and Drainage," "Roads and Bridges," and "Industrial and Civil Construction." Its primary goal is to train mid-level technical cadres for Beijing's urban construction departments. After six and a half years of study, graduates will generally reach the level of a four-year regular university program.

When the college was first established, it had only four full-time teachers and one hundred and sixty-five students. Now, there are three hundred and four students, and the number of full-time teachers has increased to fourteen, with three part-time teachers. Moreover, a higher mathematics and physics/chemistry teaching and research group has been established. This amateur higher education institution is currently located within the Beijing Civil Engineering School, allowing it to utilize the school's classrooms and laboratories. In addition, some teaching equipment required by universities has been added, basically meeting the teaching requirements.

Currently, the three hundred-plus students studying at this college come from thirty-four work units across the city. The students are distributed throughout the capital, with some as far away as Qinghe, Shijingshan, and Hujialou. Despite the dispersed locations and long commutes, the attendance rate consistently remains above 90%. Approximately 50% of the students in the first academic year achieved excellent grades, and the students' enthusiasm for learning is very high.

At present, the Beijing Amateur Urban Construction College is moving forward while overcoming various difficulties. There are many requests to audit courses, and this year, the first and second grades have already accepted one hundred and three auditors. (Attached picture)

　　北京市业余城市建设学院一年来
    教师学生增加很多
    本报讯　北京市业余城市建设学院在发展中。这所新型学院设有“给水排水”、“道路桥梁”和“工业与民用建筑”三个专业，培养的主要对象是北京市城市建设部门的中等技术干部，六年半毕业后，基本上达到普通高等学校四年制的水平。
    学院刚创办时，只有专任教师四人，学员一百六十五人。现在已经有学员三百零四人，专任教师增加到十四人，兼任教师三人，并且成立了高等数学和理化教研组。这个业余的高等学校现在设在北京市土木建筑工程学校内，因此可以利用这个学校的教室和实验室，此外增添了一些大学所需要的教学设备，基本上已经可以满足了教学上的要求。
    目前在这个学院学习的三百多名学员来自全市三十四个业务单位。学员们分布在首都各地，远的有在清河、石景山、呼家楼。在地方分散和路程远的情况下，出勤率仍能经常保持90％以上。第一学年学生成绩优良的就占50％左右，学员们的学习情绪非常饱满。
    目前，北京市业余城市建设学院正在克服种种困难中向前发展着。要求旁听的人很多，今年一、二年级已经接受了旁听生一百零三人。（附图片）
