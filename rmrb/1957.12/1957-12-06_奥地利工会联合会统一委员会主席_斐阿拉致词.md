Dear Comrades:

	Please allow me, on behalf of the Unified Committee of the Austrian Trade Union Federation, to thank you for the honor of this invitation, and at the same time to convey the warmest congratulations from the members of the Austrian trade unions, and to express our solidarity with the Chinese people and the Chinese trade unions.

	Our Austrian trade union members have met many Chinese comrades who have worked in the World Federation of Trade Unions. Their performance in all aspects of their work has made us respect and love them.

	Through these comrades, we have also learned about the great tasks that the Chinese trade unions are successfully carrying out for the happiness of the workers.

	We watch with admiration and joy the great achievements of the Chinese people in the country's socialist industrialization, the development of trade unions, and the continuous improvement of the people's cultural life. We especially congratulate the people of all ethnic groups in China for the continuous improvement of their living standards.

	Comrades! The situation of us Austrian workers is deteriorating day by day, but I am not saying that we will not develop industry.

	The continuous increase in labor intensity in factories, the increasing workload, and the compulsory, unpredictable wage system, all of these bring great suffering to the workers. As the chairman of the Austrian Trade Union Federation has had to point out, the vast majority of the benefits are taken by factory owners, large landowners, and large shareholders. Simply put: in our country, the rich are getting richer and the workers are getting poorer.

	Therefore, the workers' meager wages are being swindled away by the continuous rise in the prices of all food and daily necessities, as well as high taxes.

	Although Austria is a small country, its resources, such as oil, hydropower, timber, and steel, as well as many other mineral deposits, are very abundant. This also shows that foreign capitalists, led by the United States, are planning to seize Austria's treasures by all possible means of bribery and corruption.

	The Americans have indeed said a lot of high-sounding words about aid and democracy to countries with weak economies, but in reality, they are buying off and bribing bourgeois politicians and newspapers that can be bought, in order to seize Austria's wealth, especially Austria's oil and steel.

	The fact that Austria was liberated from Hitler's enslavement by the Soviet Red Army, and became an independent and neutral country due to the Soviet Union's diplomatic superiority, has not stopped West German capitalists and fascists from operating in Austria. West German capitalists are fully supporting all reactionary fascist movements in Austria and are constantly threatening Austria's freedom and independence.

	The Austrian trade union members and the vast majority of the Austrian people demand peace, and they severely condemn the atomic war-mongers of the United States and West Germany.

	The Unified Committee of the Austrian Trade Union Federation is fighting for peaceful coexistence among all countries in the world, it defends the freedom and independence that the Austrian people have regained, and it is fighting to improve the living standards and social welfare of all working people.

	The Austrian trade union members congratulate you on the complete victory of your congress!

	Long live the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions!

	Long live the solidarity of the working people of the world!

### 奥地利工会联合会统一委员会主席　斐阿拉致词

    奥地利工会联合会统一委员会主席
　　斐阿拉致词亲爱的同志们：
    请允许我代表奥地利工会联合会统一委员会，感谢这次邀请所给予我们的荣誉，同时转致奥地利工会会员们的最热烈的祝贺，并且表示我们和中国人民、中国工会的团结。
    我们奥地利工会的会员们认识了许多在世界工联工作过的中国同志，他们在工作中各方面的表现，都使我们感到要尊敬他们和热爱他们。
    我们通过这些同志们，也了解到一些关于中国工会为了职工们的幸福，在顺利执行的伟大任务。
    我们怀着景仰和喜悦的心情，注视着中国人民在国家社会主义工业化、工会的发展以及不断提高人民文化生活方面所获得的巨大成就。我们特别祝贺中国各族人民的生活水平得到不断的提高。
    同志们！我们奥地利工人的处境却在日益恶化，但是，我并不是说，我们将不发展工业。
    工厂中劳动强度的不断提高，工作不断加重，强制性的变化莫测的工资制度，所有这些，给工人带来极大的苦难。正如奥地利工会联合会主席所不得不指出的，绝大部分利益由工厂老板、大地主和大股东拿去。简单地说：在我们那里富人愈来愈富，工人愈来愈穷。
    因此，职工们的一点点工资，由于所有食品和日用必需品价格不断上涨以及高额捐税而被骗走了。
    奥地利虽然是一个小国，但是它的资源，如石油、水力、木材和钢铁、以及许多其他矿藏都很丰富。这也说明，以美国为首的外国资本家们，在打算以一切可能的行贿和收买手段将奥地利的宝藏攫为己有。
    美国人确实说了不少响亮的关于对经济力量薄弱国家的援助和民主的话，但是实际上他们是在收买和贿赂资产阶级政客以及可以被收买的报纸，以便夺取奥地利的财富，特别是奥地利的石油和钢铁。
    奥地利被苏联红军从希特勒奴役下解放出来，并且由于苏联在外交上的优势成为一个独立和中立国家的这个事实，并未使西德资本家和法西斯分子放手不再在奥地利活动。西德资本家全力支持奥地利所有反动的法西斯运动，并且一直威胁着奥地利的自由和独立。
    奥地利的工会会员们和绝大多数的奥地利人民都要求和平，他们严厉地谴责美国和西德的原子战争贩子。
    奥地利工会联合会统一委员会为世界各国的和平共处而斗争，它保卫着奥地利人民重新获得的自由和独立，它为提高所有劳动人民的生活水平和社会福利而斗争。
    奥地利工会会员们祝贺你们的代表大会获得完全的胜利！
    中国工会第八次全国代表大会万岁！
    全世界劳动人民的团结万岁！
