　　At School
    Young Pioneers Love Labor
    In order to cultivate children's ideological and emotional love for socialist construction, the Luo Jia Gou Primary School in Yangjiagou Township, Taozhen District, Mizhi County, Northern Shaanxi, organizes Young Pioneers to engage in various agricultural labors in coordination with their studies.
    After the autumn harvest this year, the Luo Jia Gou Primary School Young Pioneer Team launched activities to "accumulate fertilizer to increase production, and glean grain to increase production." All three Young Pioneer squadrons in the school accumulated three fertilizer cellars respectively, all made of green grass, urine, dust, and sheep manure. In the process of collecting fertilizer, the team members did not mind being dirty or tired. For example, the brigade leader Luo Xiufang, the brigade committee member Luo Yulan, and team members Dou Guanglin and Luo Wenzhang all got a manure basket and picked up manure along the way to school every day, sometimes a basket, sometimes half a basket. Under their influence, all thirty-eight Young Pioneers carried manure baskets and started picking up manure from five o'clock in the morning. They arrived at school by seven o'clock for morning exercises.

    Building a School Wall
    Xinye No. 5 Middle School in Henan Province was only established in the autumn of 1956 and had no wall. Livestock often called out near the school, and pedestrians constantly passed through, which affected normal learning and extracurricular activities, and sometimes things were lost. This semester, the school implemented the principle of building the school through diligence and thrift, calling on students to mobilize and build a wall for the school. The students actively responded to this call and used extracurricular time to build the wall in different divisions of labor. Because everyone was very motivated, in less than half a month, a wall more than a hundred zhang long and five or six chi high was finally built, saving the country hundreds of yuan in expenses.
    Work-Study Program
    Students from Xi'an Senior High School and No. 1 Middle School participated in physical labor during holidays and spare time. Some students returned to their hometowns and participated in field labor with their fathers and brothers, while others stayed at school to participate in various paid labor with a "work-study" nature. Last year, the number of students at Xi'an High School who applied for exemption from tuition exceeded 10%. After the start of this semester, many students who could not afford tuition also paid their tuition fees, and the proportion of students exempted from tuition fees dropped to below 10%. Cheng Lu, a student in Class 59B of the school, also applied for exemption from tuition fees last semester. This summer, he participated in labor and earned a total of 70 yuan, which solved the financial difficulties of tuition and book expenses for this semester. Hu Zhankai, a student in Class 59C, participated in field labor during the summer vacation and earned 620 work points, increasing the family's income. He automatically requested to give up his scholarship this semester.

　　在学校里
    少先队员爱劳动
    为了培养儿童热爱社会主义建设的思想情感，陕北米脂县桃镇区杨家沟乡罗家?小学配合学习，组织少先队员进行各种农业劳动。
    罗家?小学少年先锋队在今年秋收以后展开了“沤肥增产，拣粮增产”的活动。全校三个少先中队分别沤肥三窖，都是用青草、尿、尘土、羊粪沤成的。在收集肥料的过程中，队员们不嫌脏，也不嫌累，如大队长罗秀芳，大队委员罗玉兰，队员窦光林、罗文章都搞了个粪筐，每天去学校时沿路拾粪，有时一筐、有时半筐。在他们的影响下，三十八个少先队员都提上了粪筐，从早上五点起床就拾粪了，赶学校七点上早操时，都到了学校。

    建筑院墙
    河南省新野五中是1956年秋天才建立的，一直没有院墙，牲畜常在学校附近叫，行人也不断从那里经过，影响学习和课外活动的正常进行，有时还发生丢失东西的现象。这学期学校贯彻了勤俭建校的方针，号召学生动员起来，筑好学校的院墙。学生积极响应了这个号召，利用课外活动时间分工筑墙。由于大家劲头很足，不到半月时间，一条长百余丈、高五、六尺的围墙终于筑成了，给国家节约了数百元的开支。
    勤工俭学
    西安高级中学和第一中学学生，利用假期和课余时间参加体力劳动。同学们有的回乡和父兄一道参加田间劳动，有的留校参加各种“勤工俭学”性质的有酬劳动。去年，西安高中申请免缴学费的学生超过了10％，这学期开学后，许多缴不起学费的学生也缴了学费，免缴学费的学生比例下降到10％以下。该校五十九乙班学生成履上学期还申请免缴学费，今年暑期他参加劳动共收入七十元，就解决了本学期的学费和书籍费用困难。五十九丙班学生胡占凯在暑期中参加了田间劳动，得了六百二十个工分，增加了家庭收入，这学期自动要求放弃助学金。
