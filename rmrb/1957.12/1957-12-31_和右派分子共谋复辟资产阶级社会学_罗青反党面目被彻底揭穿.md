    Colluding with Rightists to Restore Bourgeois Sociology:
    Luo Qing's Anti-Party Face Thoroughly Exposed

    (Our Dispatch) After more than two months of exposure by comrades inside and outside the Party at the Beijing Labor Cadre School, it has been revealed that Luo Qing, the former principal of the school, is a Party member and rightist who consistently opposed the Party and its leadership, adhered to bourgeois educational viewpoints, attacked the Party, and actively participated with rightists in the restoration of bourgeois sociology.

    The revealed materials prove that Luo Qing first brought out the reactionary scholar Chen Da, erecting a "banner" for the Zhang-Luo alliance to restore bourgeois sociology. Luo Qing touted Chen Da everywhere and participated in the preparation of Chen Da's reactionary population paper. On February 15th, he presided over a forum of forty people, including rightists such as Fei Xiaotong, Li Jinghan, Pan Guangdan, and Wu Wenzao. At the meeting, the rightists vehemently attacked the Party and disseminated the reactionary Malthusian population theory. Luo Qing greatly supported this, considering it a "valuable harvest." This forum was, in effect, a gathering of political forces for the Zhang-Luo alliance to restore bourgeois sociology.

    Luo Qing also actively participated in the planning work for the restoration of bourgeois sociology. Luo Qing actively participated and offered opinions on the conspiratorial activities of rightists such as Chen Da and Wu Jingchao to restore the position of bourgeois sociology.

    During his year as the principal of the Beijing Labor Cadre School, Luo Qing consistently adopted an antagonistic attitude towards the Party on many major issues. Regarding the school's educational direction, the Party leadership of the Ministry of Labor repeatedly sent people to inspect and made clear instructions and conclusions, but Luo Qing refused to implement them. He also spread rumors among the masses, slandering that "the Ministry of Labor doesn't understand the work of the cadre school." He himself insisted on his consistent reactionary bourgeois educational viewpoint of "serving teaching, which in reality means serving the teachers." He even mobilized and organized teachers to write articles on the blackboard newspaper to support his fallacies, attempting to create public opinion and force the Party to accept his bourgeois educational direction. He also tried his best to distort the Party's policy on intellectuals, spreading the idea among teachers that "teachers are superior, and worker-peasant cadres are half-baked," and demanded that cadres from worker-peasant backgrounds serve the young intellectuals, unconditionally accommodating certain teachers' unreasonable demands. Anyone who opposed his approach was labeled as "not understanding the educational direction," thereby achieving his goal of winning over a group of cronies, squeezing out veteran worker-peasant cadres, and promoting his bourgeois educational direction in the school.

    After the start of the anti-rightist struggle, in order to conceal his reactionary face, Luo Qing publicly announced to the entire school that "no rightists have been found in the cadre school yet," and spread the argument that "bourgeois ideology is not necessarily entirely reactionary," thereby confusing the masses and weakening their fighting spirit. He also wrote editorials for the blackboard newspaper, prescribing many dos and don'ts for the anti-rightist struggle. When someone criticized this editorial, Luo Qing scolded them at a school-wide meeting as "having a background," "deliberately nitpicking, stirring up trouble, and attacking the leadership," attempting to suppress and obstruct the anti-rightist struggle in the cadre school.

    Luo Qing's degeneration into a rightist was not accidental. It has now been ascertained that he came from a rich peasant family and served as a standing committee member of the Kuomintang County Party Committee in Jiangdu County, Jiangsu Province, a section chief of the Provincial Party Committee, a political instructor at the Jiangsu Provincial Pseudo-Police Academy, secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Special Committee of the Kuomintang Reorganization Faction, and secretary-general of the Eleventh Division of Shi Yousan's Third Army. During this period, Luo Qing wrote reactionary articles such as "The Communist Party Under the Microscope" and "Democracy and Socialism" in 1927, slandering the Communist Party. After Luo Qing arrived in the Liberated Areas in 1938, he fabricated his history, gained the trust of the Party, and joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1942. In the more than ten years since joining the Party, although he has been subjected to long-term education, he has always adhered to the bourgeois stance of extreme individualism, alienated himself from the Party, and in particular, after being given a disciplinary warning within the Party in 1947 for committing serious errors, he openly refused the Party's education.

    In the face of numerous facts, the rightist Luo Qing has now begun to lower his head and confess his guilt.

    和右派分子共谋复辟资产阶级社会学
    罗青反党面目被彻底揭穿
    本报讯　北京劳动干部学校前校长罗青，经过该校党内外同志两个多月来的揭露，原来是一个一贯反党、反领导，坚持资产阶级办学观点，向党进攻并积极参与右派分子复辟资产阶级社会学的党内右派分子。
    揭发的材料证明，罗青首先抬出反动学者陈达，为章罗联盟树立起了复辟资产阶级社会学的“旗帜”。罗青曾到处为陈达吹嘘并参与陈达的反动的人口论文的准备工作。他于2月15日主持召开了一个四十人参加的座谈会，到会的有费孝通、李景汉、潘光旦、吴文藻等右派分子，会上，右派分子们大肆攻击党，散播反动的马尔萨斯人口学的观点。罗青大加支持，认为这是“宝贵的收获”。这次座谈会实际上是为章罗联盟复辟资产阶级社会学聚集了政治力量。
    罗青同时也积极参与了复辟资产阶级社会学的策划工作。陈达、吴景超等右派分子进行的复辟资产阶级社会学阵地的阴谋活动罗青都积极参加意见。
    罗青担任北京劳动干校校长的一年内，在许多重大的问题上始终和党采取对抗态度。如干校办学方针的问题，劳动部党组多次派人检查，作过明确的指示和结论，但罗青拒不执行，还在群众中散播流言，污蔑“劳动部对干校工作不懂行”。而他自己则坚持一贯主张的“为教学服务，实际上就是为教员服务”的反动的资产阶级办学观点。他并发动与组织教员在黑板报上写文章，支持他的谬论，企图造成群众舆论，强迫党接受他的资产阶级办学方针。对于党的知识分子政策，他也极力加以歪曲，他在教员中散播“教员高人一等，工农干部半瓶子醋”的思想，并要工农出身的干部为青年知识分子服务，无原则地迁就某些教员的不合理要求，谁反对他的做法，谁就是“不懂办学方针”，从而达到他拉拢一批亲信，排挤工农老干部，在学校中推行其资产阶级办学方针的目的。
    反右派斗争开始后，罗青为了掩饰自己的反动面目，他向全校人员公开宣布“干校还未发现右派分子”，并散播“资产阶级思想不一定完全是反动的”论调，以此混淆群众视听，削弱群众斗志。他还给黑板报写社论，给反右派斗争规定了许多清规戒律。有人对这篇社论提出了批评，罗青便在全校人员大会上辱骂他们是“有背景的”，“有意挑剔是非，掀风作浪，攻击领导”。企图压制和阻挠干校的反右派斗争。
    罗青堕落为右派分子不是偶然的。现已查明，他出身于富农家庭，担任过江苏省江都等县的国民党县党部常务委员、省党部的科长、江苏省伪警官学校政治教官、国民党改组派江苏省会特委书记以及石友三部第三军十一师秘书长等职务。在这期间，罗青于1927年写过“在显微镜下的共产党”“民主主义与社会主义”等污蔑共产党的反动文章。1938年罗青到解放区后，伪造历史，骗取了党的信任，1942年混入中国共产党。入党后十多年来，虽然对他进行了长期的教育，但他始终坚持资产阶级的极端个人主义的立场，同党离心离德，特别是1947年他因犯了严重错误受到留党察看的处分以后，竟公开拒绝党对他的教育。
    在大量事实面前，右派分子罗青现在已开始低头认罪。
