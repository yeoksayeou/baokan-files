    Agricultural Production Must Achieve a Great Leap Forward
    —— Notes from Attending the National Agricultural Work Conference
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Cui Baozhang

    "Agricultural production must achieve a great leap forward, and it certainly can achieve a great leap forward." The representatives attending the National Agricultural Work Conference all possess such heroic determination and confidence.

    Facts Speak Louder Than Words
    What was the situation on China's agricultural front during the First Five-Year Plan period?

    The conference presented a large number of facts demonstrating that throughout the country, whether in plains or mountains, south or north, coastal or inland areas, arid or windy-sandy regions, paddy fields or dry lands, terraced fields or low-lying areas, sandy wasteland or saline-alkali land, there have already been typical examples and experiences of great leaps forward in production. This year, the average per-mu yield of grain in 65 counties (cities) across the country reached or exceeded the targets of 400 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin respectively (including eight counties with an average grain yield of over 1,000 jin per mu). The per-mu yield of cotton in 184 counties (cities) reached and exceeded 40 jin, 60 jin, 80 jin, and 100 jin, respectively. There are even more agricultural cooperatives that achieved these high-yield targets for grain and cotton, as well as "1,000-jin cooperatives," "1,000-jin townships," and various high-yield records for various crops. These are all recent events since collectivization in the past two years.

    Even more noteworthy are the following facts:

    Pingyang County in Zhejiang Province and Huangyan and Wenling counties belong to the same coastal plain. Their natural conditions and water conservancy conditions are similar. Pingyang County even has a more favorable temperature and frost-free period than Huangyan and Wenling. However, this year, the average grain yield per mu in Huangyan and Wenling both reached 800 jin, an increase of 43% and 65% respectively compared to 1952, while the average grain yield per mu in Pingyang County this year was only 615 jin, an increase of only 14% compared to 1952. Pinggu County in Hebei Province is a semi-mountainous area, and this year's average grain yield per mu was 225 jin, an increase of 74% compared to 1952; while Tong County, which is adjacent to it and is a plain area, had an average grain yield of 222 jin per mu this year, not only did not increase compared to 1952, but decreased by 2.8%. The reason is that Huangyan County and Wenling County in Zhejiang Province paid close attention to developing pig raising for manure accumulation and planting green manure, emphasized expanding the planting area of double-cropping rice, and expanded multiple cropping, while Pingyang County did not pay attention to pig raising and planting green manure, and gradually reduced the planting area of double-cropping rice. Pinggu County in Hebei Province also raised several times more pigs than Tong County.

    Hubei Province has suffered severe natural disasters for three out of the past five years, with the floods of 1954 and this year's autumn drought being the most severe. However, this province overcame years of severe disasters and numerous difficulties, overfulfilled the Five-Year Plan tasks for agricultural production, and achieved an overall increase in agricultural and livestock products such as grain, cotton, and pigs. Eleven counties in the province achieved or exceeded the target of an average grain yield of 800 jin per mu (with Xiaogan County exceeding 1,000 jin), and two counties achieved an average cotton yield of 100 jin per mu (lint cotton). However, some provinces or counties with better natural conditions and fewer difficulties did not achieve such increased production, and some areas that were not as severely affected by disasters as Hubei Province even reduced production.

    Here is another example: Daduxiang in Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, has been a key cotton production area known throughout the province for several years. They have created a systematic set of experience in increasing cotton production, but the Xinzhou County Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) did not pay enough attention to promoting this set of experience quickly and universally throughout the county. However, in Macheng County, which is adjacent to Xinzhou, this year, from the secretary of the county party committee down to the main cadres of the agricultural cooperatives, they frequently visited Daduxiang to learn throughout the entire growth process of cotton. After returning from the visits, they quickly promoted the advanced experience and measures they learned to all cotton fields in the county through cadre demonstration in experimental fields. As a result, the average cotton yield per mu (lint cotton) in Macheng County jumped from 60 jin last year to 103 jin this year, while Xinzhou County only increased from 63 jin last year (higher than Macheng) to 72 jin this year (lower than Macheng).

    Facts speak louder than words: Collectivization has unparalleled superiority, collectivization has brought about an upsurge in agricultural production, and it has brought about the possibility of a leap forward. Geographical environment and natural conditions do have a certain impact on agricultural production, but whether agricultural production can achieve a leap forward mainly depends on leadership and on the work done.

    "All is Ready Except the East Wind"

    Why is it that some areas with not-so-bad natural conditions (even better), not-so-serious disasters (even lighter), and were originally relatively advanced areas, have had slower growth in agricultural production or even reduced production? The unanimous view of the representatives is that the work in these areas was not done well and that it was due to the right-leaning conservative thinking of some agricultural production leaders.

    Many representatives emphasized in their speeches that this right-leaning conservative thinking was particularly evident during this year's agricultural production process. Although the Central Committee issued a call before the spring plowing to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year by all means, the leaders in some places still had doubts and wavering about the effective production-increasing measures of previous years, and even reduced some successful production-increasing measures under the pretext of "anti-subjectivism" and "anti-rash advance," which brought about considerable losses to this year's agricultural production.

    The representatives specifically analyzed the national and local situations and unanimously believed that all the conditions are in place to organize a great leap forward in agricultural production in various types of regions throughout the country in accordance with the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft).

    However, "all is ready except the east wind." What is the east wind? That is the spirit of innovation in leading agricultural production, the tenacious will, and the perseverance of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountain; that is, leaders at all levels must be determined to constantly fight against all kinds of right-leaning conservative thinking and resolutely lead the peasant masses to use various favorable factors and overcome various unfavorable factors to organize and lead the great leap forward in agricultural production; that is, first of all, to have advanced thinking that dares to leap forward.

    Many provincial representatives said in their speeches that to organize a great leap forward in agricultural production, we must first have a great leap forward in thinking; with leap forward thinking, we can quickly improve leadership methods and work style, resolutely implement effective production-increasing measures, and formulate advanced production plans to achieve a great leap forward in actual production.

    At the group discussions, the representatives put forward specific methods to overcome right-leaning conservative thinking and establish leap-forward thinking, as well as concrete measures to achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production, based on local characteristics. The representatives from Yishan Special Zone in Guangxi Province, just a few days after the meeting began, sent back the experiences of Hubei Province, Xiaogan County, and Dashan Agricultural Cooperative in Junan County, Shandong Province, in overcoming numerous disasters and transforming poor mountains and bad waters to achieve overall production increases and bumper harvests, for the staff of the special zone to learn from. Subsequently, based on the experiences of other places, they studied how to tap the potential for increasing production in their local areas, put forward many specific leap-forward measures, and prepared to first summarize and check the local agricultural production situation after returning, criticize right-leaning conservative thinking among all cadres, and then fully implement basic production-increasing measures such as water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, soil improvement, and promotion of double-cropping rice to organize a great leap forward.

    Transform Leap Forward Thinking into Leap Forward Action

    In order to organize a great leap forward in agricultural production, many regions have put forward inspiring slogans for action based on local conditions. Guangdong Province proposed realizing a "1,000-jin province" in grain within ten years, Hebei Province proposed transforming from a grain-deficient province to a grain-surplus province within five years, and Liaoning Province proposed achieving grain self-sufficiency within five years; Hubei Province proposed "doubling grain production and tripling cotton and oil production within ten years"; Anhui Province's slogan is: "Exhaust labor, exhaust intelligence, exhaust potential, turn low yield into high yield, turn Huaibei into Jiangnan, and turn Jiangnan into Lingnan (referring to the multiple cropping index)." Shanxi Province's slogan is: "March towards the mountainous areas, march towards the windy-sandy areas, and march towards the saline-alkali land." Sichuan Province's slogan is: "Catch up with the production level of well-to-do middle peasants three years ahead of schedule, catch up with the income level of well-to-do middle peasants two years ahead of schedule, and complete the requirement of 800 jin per mu one year ahead of schedule."

    The representatives generally believed that this National Agricultural Work Conference has played a great role in promoting the overcoming of right-leaning conservative thinking and organizing a great leap forward in national agricultural production. The conference strengthened people's confidence and determination to achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production. Many representatives not only examined their own right-leaning conservative thinking but also examined the original agricultural production development plans of their regions based on leap-forward thinking; some representatives found that the originally planned targets of their regions were too low and did not resemble leap-forward targets, and put forward suggestions for revision. Shanxi Province originally planned a total grain output target of 8.92 billion jin for 1958, and an average cotton yield of 40 jin per mu (lint cotton); now they plan to increase the grain output to 9.5 billion jin and the cotton yield to 60 jin. Anhui Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also plan to appropriately increase the originally planned grain production increase targets. Zhao Buli, the first secretary of the Shunchang County Party Committee in Fujian Province, attended this meeting. He had always believed that the work in Shunchang County was relatively advanced and had some complacency. However, after listening to the experiences introduced by other provinces and counties at the meeting, he realized that his thinking and the county's production plan were conservative and backward. He immediately wrote letters and made long-distance calls to inform comrades in the county of the advanced experiences of other regions in leading agricultural production and suggested revising future production plans. After receiving his letters and calls, the comrades in the county immediately studied them and then wrote back agreeing with his opinions. They analyzed the agricultural production conditions in Shunchang County and believed that they were fully confident in raising the agricultural production increase rate in Shunchang County a step further. They tentatively decided that the average grain yield per mu in the county next year would be raised from the original plan of 400 jin to 470 jin, striving to reach 500 jin; to achieve the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) by 1962 to reach 800 jin, and to reach 1,000 jin by 1967 (the original plan was 700 jin in 1962 and 900 jin in 1967). The production and income level of the agricultural cooperative members in the county will also catch up with and exceed the level of local well-to-do middle peasants next year (the original plan was within three years).

    农业生产一定能够大跃进
    ——全国农业工作会议旁听记
    新华社记者　崔葆章
    “农业生产一定要大跃进，一定能够大跃进”，出席全国农业工作会议的代表们，都具有这样豪迈的决心和信心。
    事实胜于雄辩
    第一个五年计划期间，我国农业战线上出现了怎样的情况呢？
    会上摆出了大量的事实，说明在全国范围内，不管是平原和山区，南方和北方，海滨和内陆，干旱区和风砂区，水田和旱地，梯田和洼地，沙荒地和盐碱地，都已经有了生产大跃进的典型事例和经验。今年，全国有六十五个县（市）的粮食每亩平均产量，分别达到或超过了四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的指标（其中有八个县平均每亩产粮食千斤以上），有一百八十四个县（市）的棉花每亩产量分别达到和超过了四十斤、六十斤、八十斤、一百斤。粮棉产量达到上述这些高产指标的农业社，以及“千斤社”、“千斤乡”和各种农作物的高额丰产纪录就更多了。这些都是合作化以后最近两年的事。
    更引起人们注意的是下面的一些事实：
    浙江省的平阳县和黄岩、温岭两县同属滨海平原，自然条件和水利条件不相上下，平阳县的气温和无霜期还优于黄岩和温岭。但是，黄岩、温岭今年的粮食产量平均每亩都达到了八百斤，分别比1952年增产43％和65％，平阳县今年的粮食每亩产量只有六百一十五斤，比1952年只增产14％。河北省的平谷县是个半山区，今年粮食产量平均每亩二百二十五斤，比1952年增长74％；而和它邻近的通县是个平原区，今年粮食产量每亩平均是二百二十二斤，比1952年不仅没有增长，反而下降了2.8％。原因是：浙江省的黄岩县和温岭县都很注意发展养猪积肥和种植绿肥，重视扩大双季稻的种植面积，扩大了复种，而平阳县却不注意养猪和种植绿肥，并逐年缩小双季稻的种植面积；河北省平谷县养的猪，也比通县多了几倍。
    湖北省五年来有三年遭受严重的自然灾害，其中以1954年的洪水灾害和今年的秋旱为最重。但是这个省战胜了连年严重的灾害和重重困难，超额完成了农业生产的五年计划任务，获得了粮、棉、猪等农牧产品的全面增产，并且有十一个县的粮食产量达到和超过每亩平均八百斤（其中孝感县已超过了千斤）的指标，有两个县的棉花产量每亩平均达到一百斤（皮棉）。而有些自然条件较好、困难较少的省或县，却没有达到这样的增产成就，甚至有些遭灾程度并不比湖北省严重的地区还减了产。
    还有这样一个例子：湖北省新洲县大渡乡几年来都是闻名全省的棉花生产重点，在棉花生产上创造了一套系统的增产经验，但是中共新洲县委对全县普遍迅速推广这一套经验注意不够。而和新洲相邻的麻城县，今年却上从中共县委书记下至农业社的主要干部，在棉花的整个生长过程中，经常到大渡乡去参观学习，参观回来就通过干部在试验田进行典型示范的办法，把学到的先进经验、措施迅速在全县所有的棉田里推广。结果，麻城县的棉花每亩平均产量（皮棉）由去年的六十斤一跃而为今年的一百零三斤，新洲县由去年的六十三斤（比麻城高）才增加到今年的七十二斤（比麻城低）。
    事实胜于雄辩：合作化具有无比的优越性，合作化带来了农业生产的高潮，带来了跃进的可能。地理环境和自然条件对农业生产固然有一定的影响，但是农业生产能不能跃进，主要还是决定于领导，决定于工作。
    “万事齐备，只欠东风”
    为什么有些地区自然条件并不差（甚至还优越些），遭灾程度并不严重（甚至还轻些），原来还是比较先进的地区，农业生产的增长速度却比较慢、甚至还减了产？代表们一致的看法是这些地区的工作没做好，是某些农业生产领导者的右倾保守思想作了怪。
    不少代表在发言中都强调指出，这种右倾保守思想在今年的农业生产过程中表现得特别明显。虽然中央在春耕以前就提出了千方百计争取今年农业大丰收的号召，但是某些地方的领导者还是对往年行之有效的增产措施发生了怀疑、动摇，甚至在“反主观”、“反冒进”的借口下缩减了一些成功的增产措施，从而给今年的农业生产带来不少损失。
    代表们具体地分析了全国和本地的情况，一致认为：根据全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的要求，在全国各种不同类型的地区组织农业生产大跃进的各种条件已经具备了。
    但是，“万事齐备，只欠东风”。东风是什么？那就是领导农业生产的革新的精神，顽强的意志，愚公移山的毅力；那就是各级领导要下定决心，不断地与各式各样的右倾保守思想做斗争，坚定不移地领导农民群众利用各种有利因素、克服各种不利因素，来组织和领导农业生产的大跃进；那就是首先要有敢于跃进的先进思想。
    许多省的代表在发言中都说，要组织农业生产大跃进首先要有思想上的大跃进；有了跃进的思想，才能迅速改进领导方法和工作作风、坚决贯彻有效的增产措施、订出先进的生产规划，达到生产实际上的大跃进。
    在小组讨论会上，代表们纷纷根据本地特点，提出克服右倾保守思想、树立跃进思想的具体办法，和实现农业生产大跃进的具体措施。广西省宜山专区的代表，在会议开始没几天，就把湖北省、孝感县和山东省莒南县大山农业社等地战胜重重困难灾害、改造穷山恶水，获得全面增产丰收的经验，寄回去让专区的工作人员学习；随后他们又根据别地的经验研究了怎样发掘本地的增产潜力，提出许多具体的跃进措施，准备回去后首先结合总结和检查本地农业生产情况，在全体干部中批判右倾保守思想，然后全力贯彻兴修水利、积肥、改良土壤、推广双季稻等基本增产措施，组织大跃进。
    把跃进思想变为跃进行动
    为了组织农业生产大跃进，许多地区已经根据本地情况提出了振奋人心的行动口号。广东省提出十年内实现粮食“千斤省”，河北省提出五年内由缺粮省变成余粮省，辽宁省提出五年内粮食自给；湖北省提出“十年内粮食增产一倍，棉花、油料增产两倍”；安徽省的口号是：“用尽劳力，竭尽智力，挖尽潜力，把低产变为高产，把淮北变为江南，把江南变为岭南（指复种指数）。”山西省是：“向山区进军，向风砂区进军，向盐碱地进军。”四川省是：“提前三年赶上富裕中农生产水平，提前两年赶上富裕中农的收入水平，提前一年完成亩产八百斤的要求。”
    代表们普遍认为，这次全国农业工作会议对克服右倾保守思想、组织全国农业生产大跃进，起了很大的促进作用。会议坚定了人们实现农业生产大跃进的信心和决心。不少代表不仅检查了自己的右倾保守思想，而且根据大跃进思想检查了本地区原订的发展农业生产的规划；有的代表发现本地区原订的计划指标偏低，不像个大跃进的指标，提出了修改意见。山西省原计划1958年的粮食总产量指标是八十九点二亿斤，棉花的每亩平均产量是四十斤（皮棉）；现在打算把粮食提高为九十五亿斤，棉花提高为六十斤。安徽省和内蒙古自治区也计划把原订的粮食增产指标都适当提高。中共福建省顺昌县县委第一书记赵布礼参加了这个会，他一直认为顺昌县的工作是比较先进的，并有些自满情绪。但是，当他在会上听了别省别县介绍的经验后，就发现自己的思想和全县的生产规划是保守、落后了。他立刻写信、打长途电话把别的地区领导农业生产的先进经验告诉县里的同志们，并建议修改今后的生产规划；县里的同志接到他的信和电话后，马上研究，以后就回信同意他的意见。他们分析了顺昌县的农业生产条件，认为完全有把握把顺昌县的农业增产速度提高一步。他们初步确定，全县的粮食每亩平均产量明年要由原计划的四百斤提高到四百七十斤，争取达到五百斤；1962年实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的要求达到八百斤，1967年达到一千斤（原计划1962年是七百斤，1967年是九百斤）。全县农业社社员的生产和收入水平，也要提前在明年（原计划是三年内）赶上和超过当地富裕中农的水平。
