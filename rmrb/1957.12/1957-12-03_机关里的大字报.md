Institution are too large and responsibilities unclearly defined
    Everyone is responsible, yet no one is responsible
    The internal structure of the ministry is vast, and the scope of responsibilities of each bureau is not clearly defined. For a single task, various units often pass the buck. The minister also lacks his own opinion, deciding today that this unit should handle it, and tomorrow that another unit should handle it. This creates a situation where everyone is responsible, yet no one is responsible. This prevents the accumulation of original data, causing significant losses to our work. For example, the management of quality accidents was handled successively by the Production Bureau, the Planning Department, the Production Bureau, and finally the Technical Supervision Bureau.
    We believe that this constant switching offers no benefit. There's a disconnect between each switch, and no one has systematic data. When the minister asks for information, no one can provide it. Therefore, we are finding it very difficult to write the five-year work summary, winter construction review, and engineering quality review now.

    Hurriedly going down, returning empty-handed, doing things perfunctorily
    The Central Government has called on us to step out of the office, go deep into the grassroots, and connect with reality. Our ministry also often sends people on business trips, which is right. The problem is that many of these trips lack adequate preparation beforehand. They go down in a hurry, and it's not clear how they will work. After returning, there is no apparent improvement in our work. Generally, we see only these three situations: (1) lengthy work reports that people are afraid to look at, and it's "heaven knows" what problems are solved in this lengthy text. (2) A brief oral report, and that's it. (3) Even the oral report is omitted. There are many examples of this, and we feel ashamed before the people for spending so much money on business trips!
    We suggest that future business trips should be purposeful, not blind. After going down, we should bring something back, not return empty-handed. After returning, we should work with relevant leaders to draw certain conclusions, doing as much as we can to move the work forward. To this end, the General Office should take concrete measures to ensure this, such as creating a special file for business trips, assigning someone to inspect them, or using other methods to implement this. In short, the ministry leadership cannot take a bureaucratic attitude towards this irresponsible phenomenon and turn a blind eye.

    Going from Beijing to Tianjin Requires a Detour Through Xi'an
    Are the chaotic and buck-passing phenomena that occur in our work man-made? From the perspective of the units under our ministry: The Xi'an Engineering Management General Bureau has an office in Tianjin for the Sixth Company of Xi'an, specifically undertaking engineering tasks in the Tianjin area. Because this office is under the leadership of Xi'an, it creates great inconvenience in our work. For example, instructions issued by the ministry go from Beijing to Xi'an, and then back to Tianjin, traveling back and forth over two thousand kilometers. Conversely, reports from below, as well as various reports and data, are inevitably delayed for a long time.
    This shows the subjectivism in our leadership work, which fails to adapt to local conditions and causes chaos in our work. We hope that this rectification opportunity will be used to overcome this phenomenon.

    Does Approving a Document Take Two Months?
    The periodic statistical reports of our ministry for 1957, after repeated study and revision, were finalized and submitted to Director Meng for review and forwarding to the ministry's Party group and the minister for approval in December 1956. However, this "urgent matter" was not issued until February 19th. May we ask, does an "urgent matter" that needs to be issued quickly so that grassroots units can fill it out at the beginning of the year really take two months to approve? We believe that Director Meng, the ministry's Party group, and the minister all have a serious style of procrastination. Because these reports were issued late, it was already early March when they reached the grassroots units. The grassroots also have to develop original records, rules, and regulations based on these forms to implement them, which greatly affects the progress of the work. The untimely submission and poor quality of the first half-year statistical reports are also due to this. Recently, the periodic statistical reports of our ministry for 1958 are about to be finalized. I hope that the leaders will resolutely overcome this procrastinating work style when approving various statistical reports and related rules and regulations for 1958.

专栏：机关里的大字报

    机构庞大职责划分不清
    人人负责人人都不负责
    部内机构很庞大，各司局的职责范围无明确的划分，一件工作各单位往往互相踢皮球。部长也缺乏主见，今天决定这个单位搞，明天又决定那个单位搞。这样就形成人人负责，人人都不负责。使得原始资料无法积累，工作受到了很大的损失。比如，质量事故的管理工作，曾先后由生产局、计划司、生产局、最后才交技术监督局。
    我们认为这样管来管去，没有一点好处。前后脱节，谁也无有系统的资料，部长向谁要资料，谁也拿不出。因此，现在写五年工作总结，冬季施工评论，工程质量评论感到有很大的困难。

    匆匆忙忙下去  空空洞洞回来  马马虎虎了事
    中央号召我们走出办公室，深入基层，接触实际。我们部里也常有人出差，这是对的。问题是许多次出差，事前并没有充分准备，匆忙下去，下去怎样工作不说，回来之后，对工作的提高，不见有什么效果。得到的，一般说只是这三种情况：（1）长篇工作汇报，人家看见就害怕，在这冗长的文字中究竟解决什么问题，那是“天晓得”。
  （2）口头汇报一下完事。（3）连口头汇报也省去了。这种例子可以举出很多，花那么多钱出差，对人民是问心有愧的！
    建议今后出差，要有目的下去，不要盲目下去，下去以后；要捞一把回来，不要空手回来；回来后要和有关领导一起做出一定的结论，能作多少就作多少，把工作推进一步。为此，要办公厅采取具体的保证措施，或者出差专卷立案，专人检查，或者用其他办法贯彻执行。总之，部的领导不能对这种不负责任现象，采取官僚主义的态度，熟视无睹。

    从北京去天津要绕道西安走
    我们工作中所发生的忙乱扯皮现象是不是人为的？从我们部所属单位来看：西安工程管理总局在天津设有一个西安六公司天津办事处，专门承担天津地区的工程任务。因为这个办事处属于西安领导，给工作中造成很大不便。如部发出的指示，由北京到西安，由西安再转回天津，往返跑二千多公里。相反的下边给上报告，以及各种报表等资料，也就必然拖延了很长时间。
    由此看出我们领导工作中的主观主义，不能因地制宜造成工作中的忙乱，希望通过这次整风机会将这种现象加以克服。

    审批一个文件要两个月吗？
    我部1957年的定期统计报表经过反复研究与修改后，在1956年12月间就全部定稿送孟司长审核并转部党组和部长审批。但是这个“急件”一直拖到2月19日才颁发下去，试问一个在年初就要基层填报而急需颁发的“急件”要审批两个月吗？我们认为孟司长，部党组和部长都存在着较严重的拖拉作风。这些报表由于颁发迟，到基层单位已是3月初了，基层还要根据这些表格制订原始记录，章则制度来贯彻，在很大程度上影响工作的开展，上半年统计报表报送不及时，质量不高，这也是原因之一。最近我部1958年的定期统计报表就要定稿了，我希望领导上在审批1958年各种统计报表和有关章则制度时，要坚决的克服这种拖拉的工作作风。
        建筑工程部　阮绍宗、陆加明
