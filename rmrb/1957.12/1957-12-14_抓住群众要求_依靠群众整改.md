Grasp the Demands of the Masses, Rely on the Masses for Rectification
　　中共Quwo县委工作组 (Zhonggong Quwo Xianwei Gongzuozu) - Work Group of the Quwo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    After Jianhua Cooperative in Xiyang Township, Quwo County, Shanxi Province, implemented the principle of "resolutely rectify, boldly rectify, and thoroughly rectify" during the rectification movement, it not only effectively improved the leadership style and strengthened the relationship with the masses, but also greatly encouraged the masses' enthusiasm for speaking out freely and extensively. During the "blooming and contending" stage, the cooperative put forward a total of 831 opinions of various kinds, but after resolutely solving a large number of problems, another 922 opinions of various kinds were put forward in three days. Many people who had not previously offered opinions and those who had not spoken out expressed their inner thoughts.

　　Starting from the Urgent Demands of the Masses

    During the "blooming and contending" stage, Jianhua Cooperative put forward a total of 659 opinions of various kinds. After entering the debate stage, the enthusiasm of the masses once declined; they couldn't "bloom" and couldn't debate. Many cooperative cadres harbored the idea that they would be criticized, with some saying:
  “During the movement, the masses can say whatever they want, otherwise they’ll be criticized. I’m not doing it anymore anyway.” They prepared to quit after the "blooming and contending" debate and adopted a passive attitude towards the movement. Many people held the attitude that it was better to say less, with many reflecting: "What's the point of offering opinions? Problems aren't solved. The more opinions you offer, the more people you offend. Why offend people?" Some said: "What time is it? Like a mute entering a temple, kowtow more and talk less, and you can't go wrong." Others said: "If you offer opinions now, you won't be able to bear it if they give you a hard time later." In response to this situation, the Party branch seriously analyzed and studied, believing that the root cause of the above problems was that the improvement of work had not kept up with the "blooming." Therefore, the management committee decided, after research, to deal with six general issues, such as individual cases of embezzlement of public funds. Although more than 170 opinions were put forward at this time, the masses still reflected: "This is plugging holes and applying plasters. It's like picking up sesame seeds after an oil jar has overturned. What's the point!" This clearly shows that the issues dealt with this time were still far from the urgent demands of the masses. According to the reflections of the masses, the Party branch conducted a special study again, believing that dragging on and dealing with problems in a small way could not eliminate the ideological concerns of the masses. It immediately decided that the Party branch would be the core, absorbing relevant personnel to participate, and fully shift to rectification work. After studying the opinions put forward by the masses one by one, they were summarized into four categories and explanations were made accordingly: (1) The correct criticisms and suggestions were sincerely accepted and should be corrected immediately, totaling 602. (2) Policy issues and issues that needed to be referred to higher authorities for resolution totaled 67. (3) Erroneous arguments attacking cooperativization and the policy of unified purchase and sale must be submitted to the general assembly for debate to clarify right and wrong, totaling 86. (4) The reactionary words and deeds of illegal landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements that needed to be refuted totaled 18. In the first category of opinions, all were issues urgently requiring resolution, such as: chaotic labor management; unreasonable quotas; unclear finances of the sideline production team; overstaffing; the sideline production team engaging in sideline production while also managing land, failing to do either well; 2,100 work points being privately distributed to 20 cooperative cadres; cooperative cadres not leaving the office, only assigning work without inspection, etc. According to the requirements of all members, it was decided to first resolve the above issues.

　　Relying on the Masses to Boldly Solve Problems

    After the previous stage of socialist education, the consciousness of the broad masses had been greatly enhanced. Therefore, when improving work, it is necessary to consult with the masses in order to solve problems quickly and well. For example, cooperative member Shi Zhenshan pointed out that last year the cooperative took 40 cartloads of manure from him without paying. Cooperative member Yang Xizeng said, "That was such a small pile, how could it be 40 cartloads?" Cooperative member Heng Zegao said, "This manure issue has already been resolved, why are you bringing it up again?" Shi Zhenshan said, "Only three cartloads were resolved." Wei Mingliang said, "When was it taken? Who took it? Without a witness, you're just talking nonsense. How can this be resolved?" In this way, through mutual criticism among the masses, Shi Zhenshan's idea of muddying the waters was immediately refuted. In addition, when solving problems, the supervisory power of the masses should also be relied upon to prevent bureaucracy from raising its head in the rectification work.

    On the basis of investigation, research, deliberation and discussion, Jianhua Cooperative convened a general meeting of all members and announced the handling of 613 opinions (accounting for 82.28% of the problems that should be handled). For example, all advance payments of work points to cooperative cadres were cancelled; the land managed by the sideline production team was all returned to the production teams, and the number of personnel was reduced from the original 26 to 18, etc. After the problems were announced, the Party branch secretary, production team leader, finance team leader, production team leader, and cooperative member Xu Taihe, who had defrauded work points, all voluntarily made self-criticisms at the meeting. Criticism was also directed at Yang Sili, the deputy director of production, and Sang Changqing, the deputy leader of the fifth team, for suppressing criticism, and they were asked to make public self-criticisms at the mass meetings of the teams. Zhao Guoqi, the Party branch secretary, repeatedly explained to the masses that the Party branch would be in charge, that they should not be afraid of retaliation, and mobilized all members to resolutely speak out, guaranteeing that "everything would be explained and everything would be settled." This method of dealing with problems was very educational and enlightening to the masses. Cooperative members reflected, "Today is truly gratifying." Twenty-two people immediately approached the Party branch secretary directly and wrote notes to offer opinions, and a total of 98 opinions were put forward on the spot. From this it can be seen that timely resolution of the problems raised by the masses during the "blooming and contending," and vigorous improvement of work, is a decisive link in eliminating the various ideological concerns of the masses and further encouraging and enlightening the broad masses to speak out completely. After the first batch of problems were dealt with, the number of opinions raised by the masses increased from the original 659 to 831. After a large number of opinions were dealt with this time, the number increased to 1,753 in three days. The resolute actions of the leadership in improving work greatly stimulated the high tide of production among the broad masses of peasants. The deputy director of production, the production team leader, etc., are now all out of the office and deep into the fields. More than 30 women from Dayang Village, including Li Fenglian and Zhang Lanhua, went to the fields at night to pull out hemp. Male cooperative members accumulated more than 800 cartloads of fertilizer in eight days. Due to the high morale of the members and the outstanding production achievements, they won the mobile red flag in the recent township-wide inspection of production competition. Facts tell us that rectification not only does not affect production, but also greatly promotes production, and only by doing a good job in production can we stabilize the mood of the masses and actively participate in rectification.

    Several Problems

    1. The rectification meeting was held somewhat too late. Generally speaking, it is best to place it in the middle of the "blooming and contending" period for maximum effect.

    2. Some problems were solved relatively simply and hastily. For example, with regard to the work style problems or criticisms of certain cadres, the simple reply "they will be instructed to correct themselves in the future" was given, without any specific measures for how to correct themselves.

    3. It must be noted that the improvement of work should not be regarded simply as a means of launching the "blooming and contending." If this is the case, one will fall into the mire of only solving specific problems and neglecting ideological mobilization.

    4. Although a large number of problems have been dealt with, close attention should still be paid to checking the implementation after handling and preventing the emergence of ideological slackness.

　　抓住群众要求  依靠群众整改
　　中共曲沃县委工作组
    山西省曲沃县西杨乡建华社，在整风运动中，贯彻“坚决地改、大胆地改、彻底地改”的方针后，不仅有效地改进了领导作风，密切了社群关系，而且大大地鼓舞了群众大鸣大放的积极性。在鸣放阶段，全社共提出各种意见八百三十一条，但通过雷厉风行地解决了一大批问题后，三天中又鸣放出各种意见九百二十二条。许多以前没提意见的人和没说过话的人都说出了自己的心里话。
　　从群众的迫切要求入手
    建华社在鸣放阶段共鸣放出各种意见六百五十九条。转入辩论后，群众情绪曾一度低落，鸣放不出，也辩论不起来。不少社干部存着挨整思想，有的说：
  “在运动中群众提啥是啥，不然就得挨整，反正自己是不干了”。准备在鸣放辩论后换班不干，对运动采取了消极态度。很多群众抱着少说为佳的态度，不少人反映：“提了顶啥，不解决问题，提的意见多，惹的人多，何必得罪人”。有的说：“这是啥时候，哑巴进庙，多磕头，少说话，没错”。还有的说：“这会提意见，以后给个小鞋穿可受不了”。针对这种情况，党支部认真作了分析研究，认为产生上述问题的根本原因主要是改进工作没有赶上鸣放。于是经管委会研究决定，处理了个别人挪用公款等六个一般问题。这时虽然又鸣放了一百七十多条意见，但群众还反映说：“这是堵窟窿、贴膏药，油篓翻了拾芝麻，顶啥！”。这就很明显的看出这次所处理的问题，与群众的迫切要求还相距很远。党支部根据群众反映又作了专门研究，认为拖拖拉拉，小手小脚处理问题，还不能解除群众的思想顾虑，当即决定，以党支部为核心吸收有关人员参加，全力转向整改工作，对群众鸣放出的意见，逐条研究后，归纳成四类，分别作出交代：（1）对正确的批评和建议诚恳接受，并应立即改正的有六百零二条。（2）对有关政策性问题和需要请示上级解决的有六十七条。（3）对于攻击合作化和统购统销政策的错误论点，必须提交大会辩论，弄清是非的有八十六条。（4）不法地主、富农和坏分子的反动言行，需要驳斥的有十八条。在第一类意见中，全是迫切要求解决的问题，如：劳动管理混乱；定额不合理；副业股财务不清，人浮于事，副业股搞副业还经营土地，两头都没搞好；二十个社干部私加工分二千一百多分；社干部走不出办公室，工作只布置不检查等。根据全体社员的要求，即决定首先解决上述问题。
　　依靠群众大胆解决问题
    经过前一阶段的社会主义教育，广大群众觉悟已经大大提高，因此改进工作时，必须和群众商量，才能又快又好地解决问题。如社员史振山提出去年社里拉了他四十车粪没出钱。社员杨希曾说：“那么一小堆，那有四十车？”社员衡泽高说：“这粪已经解决了，你怎么又提？”史振山说：“只解决了三车。”卫明亮说：“多会拉的，谁拉的没有证明人光说假话，这怎么能解决？”就这样经过群众互相批评，当场就驳倒了史振山这种混水摸鱼的思想。此外，在解决问题时，还应当依靠群众的监督力量，来防止官僚主义在整改工作中抬头。
    建华社在调查研究，酝酿讨论基本成熟的基础上，便召开全体群众大会，宣布处理了六百一十三条意见（占应处理问题的82.28％）。如社干部的预借工全部去掉；副业股经营的土地全部归生产队，人员由原来的二十六人减为十八人等。问题宣布后，党支书、生产股长、财务股长、生产队长、以及骗取工分的社员许太和等，都主动地在大会上进行了检讨。并对压制批评的生产副股长杨思礼和五队副队长桑长青进行了批评，让他在队的群众会上作公开检讨。党支书赵国其，再三向群众说明，由党支部作主，不要怕报复，发动全体社员坚决地放，保证做到“件件有交代，事事有着落”。这种处理问题的办法，对群众教育启发很大。社员反映说：“今天真是大快人心”。直接找党支书和写条子鸣放的即有二十二人，当场共放出九十八条意见。由此可见，及时解决群众在鸣放中提出的问题，狠狠地改进工作，是解除群众各种思想顾虑，进一步鼓舞和启发广大群众鸣尽放透的决定环节。第一批处理了少数问题，群众鸣放意见由原来的六百五十九条，增加到八百三十一条。这次处理了一大批意见后，三天就增加到一千七百五十三条意见。领导上坚决改进的积极行动，大大激发了广大农民群众的生产高潮。生产副社长、生产股长等现在都走出办公室，深入到田间去了。大杨村李凤莲、张兰花等三十多个妇女晚上下地拔花柴。男社员八天积肥八百多车。由于社员情绪高涨，生产成绩突出，因而在最近的全乡大检查中，夺取了生产竞赛流动红旗。事实告诉我们：整风不仅不影响生产，而且能大大的推动生产，也只有搞好生产才能安定群众情绪积极参加整风。
    几个问题
    一、整改大会开得有些过迟。一般说来，最好放在鸣放中期作用最大。
    二、有些问题解决的比较简单、草率，如对某些干部的作风问题或批评意见，只是简单答复“今后责其改正”就完了，到底怎样改正，没有具体办法。
    三、必须注意，不应把改进工作单纯当作发动鸣放的手段，如果这样，就会陷入只解决具体问题，而忽视了思想发动的泥坑。
    四、尽管一大批问题已作了处理，还应十分注意检查处理后的执行情况和防止思想松懈的现象发生。
