    Soviet Komsomol Members Report Success in the Savings Campaign: 3 Billion Rubles Saved in Half a Year

    (Based on reports) In the past six months, Soviet Komsomol members have saved 3 billion rubles for the country during the All-Union Komsomol Savings Campaign launched to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

    This movement was initiated by the young oil workers of Grozny and the young construction workers of Kuibyshev, who called on all Komsomol members in the Soviet Union. During the savings campaign, Komsomol members throughout the Soviet Union racked their brains to save every bit of material for the motherland. Komsomol members of the Third Branch of the Tuimazy Oil Company spent a few days identifying many loopholes in oil consumption in the work of various sections. After overcoming these shortcomings, they saved 130 tons of oil for the country in one month.

    At the beginning of the savings campaign, Komsomol members estimated that if each member in the country saved 100 rubles for the country, a total of 2 billion rubles could be saved. However, thanks to the efforts of young patriots, they have saved 3 billion rubles for the country in just half a year so far.

    苏联共青团员节约进军报捷
    半年来节省达三十亿卢布
    本报讯　在过去半年间，苏联共青团员在为庆祝十月革命四十周年而发起的全苏共青团员节约大进军运动中，已为国家节约了三十亿卢布。
    这个运动是由格罗兹内青年石油工人和古比雪夫青年建筑工人向全苏共青团员号召而开展起来的。在节约运动中，全苏联共青团员都开动脑筋，为祖国节约一点一滴的财物。图依玛兹石油公司第三分公司的共青团员们，利用几天时间，在各工段的工作中找出了不少耗损石油的漏洞，在克服了这些缺点之后的一个月期间，就为国家节省了一百三十吨石油。
    在节约大进军运动开始时，共青团员们估计，如果全国每个团员都为国家节约一百卢布，总共就可节约二十亿卢布。但是在青年爱国者的努力下，到目前为止，仅仅半年，他们就为国家节约了三十亿卢布。
