To the dear comrades!

    Originally, it was intended that our General Secretary, Comrade Di Vittorio, would personally extend to your 8th National Congress the fraternal respect of the Italian General Confederation of Labour, the working class, and the Italian people. This was something he considered a great honor. However, Comrade Di Vittorio's sudden passing has prevented him from coming to your country, to the midst of the working people of great People's China. His death has presented our union with some difficult and urgent issues. Therefore, we cannot send representatives to attend your congress and can only send you this letter of greeting.

    To you, the comrades of the 8th National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, and to the working people of People's China, we extend our warmest wishes and congratulate you on your greatest victories in your work.

    Dear representatives, we know, at least in general terms, the issues facing the Chinese working class and the tasks of your unions in building a new society in your country while continuously improving the people's living standards. In particular, the delegation of the Italian General Confederation of Labour, which was invited to visit your country, had the opportunity to study your issues and experiences on the ground, admired the achievements you have made in building a new China, and deepened our understanding of these circumstances through their accounts.

    Therefore, we know that your unions are mobilizing and organizing the working masses, adopting methods that are adapted to the economic characteristics of your country, and making great strides on the road to socialism.

    We know that the Chinese working class and the Chinese people have not only completed but also exceeded the first Five-Year Plan. One of the tasks of your congress is to study the experiences of the past few years so that your workers are better prepared to implement even more ambitious plans for developing the economy, culture, and all aspects of society.

    We know that in your country, unemployment has been virtually eliminated, workers' real wages are constantly increasing, the culture of the masses is being enhanced, and various forms of social welfare and social insurance are increasing. All of this contributes to your people's progress towards socialism.

    Dear comrades, we congratulate you on your achievements because these achievements have a huge impact on the international workers' movement and provide great assistance to the struggles of Italian workers.

    Seeing your achievements inspires and helps our workers in their daily struggle against domestic monopoly capital and capitalists. Italian workers believe and are convinced that one day they will follow the same path as you.

    They are waging an irreconcilable struggle to increase wages, reduce working hours, eliminate a workforce of two million unemployed people, and create new employment opportunities. At the same time, we must also fight to defend the trade union and democratic rights that Italian workers have gained through long struggles. These rights are being threatened by the combined forces of Italian monopoly capitalists and imperialism. The Italian General Confederation of Labour is leading these struggles under the banner of solidarity at the grassroots level, just as Comrade Vittorio said recently on the platform of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Leipzig: "For the past year and a half, we have led many large-scale struggles in Italy. These struggles have been carried out under the banner of unified action among the industrial and local unions affiliated with our three general confederations, and according to the specific needs of each industry. In all these struggles, the workers have achieved victories. These struggles have involved two million agricultural workers and various industries and important public services: construction, chemicals, hardware, railways, trams, post and telecommunications, gas, etc. A total of nearly four million workers participated in highly militant unified strikes, and through united struggles, they have achieved significant economic improvements."

    We will continue our trade union activities in the interests of Italian workers and people under conditions of unity and solidarity. Under the same conditions of unity and solidarity, we will continue to fight to defend peace and oppose all war provocateurs.

    Comrades, we join you in working for the maintenance of peace. You are engaged in the peaceful socialist construction in your own country, while we are fighting for the interests of the working class. You and we will continue to move forward, striving to achieve a common goal: to build a new, peaceful, happy, and flourishing society throughout the world.

    We once again wish your congress great success in its work.

    Long live the 8th National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions!

    Long live the working class and people of People's China!

    Long live the solidarity and friendship of the international proletariat!

                            Secretariat of the Italian General Confederation of Labour, Santillana

### 意大利总工会的贺信

专栏：

　　意大利总工会的贺信亲爱的同志们！
    本来应当由我们总书记迪·维多里奥同志亲自来向贵会第八次全国代表大会致以意大利总工会、工人阶级以及意大利人民的兄弟般的敬意。这曾经是他认为莫大光荣的事。但是，迪·维多里奥同志的突然逝世，使他不能来到贵国，来到伟大人民中国的劳动者中间。他的逝世使我们工会面临着一些困难而急迫的问题。因此，我们不能派出代表出席你们的大会，只能向你们发出这封贺信。
    向你们，中国工会第八次全国代表大会的各位代表同志以及向人民中国的劳动人民致以最友好的愿望，祝贺你们在工作中获得最伟大的胜利。
    亲爱的代表们，我们知道，至少是大体上知道，中国工人阶级所面临的问题，和你们的工会在自己的国家里建设新社会、同时不断改善人民生活水平方面的任务。特别是应邀访问了贵国的意大利总工会代表团，他们能有机会就地研究你们的问题和经验，仰慕你们在建设新中国中所获得的成就，从他们口里，我们对这些情况加深了了解。
    因此，我们知道你们的工会动员和组织工人群众，采用与贵国经济特点相适应的方法，在走向社会主义道路上大步前进。
    我们知道，中国工人阶级和中国人民，不仅完成、而且超额完成了第一个五年计划。你们的大会的任务之一是研究几年以来的经验，使你们的劳动者有更好的准备，去实现发展经济、文化和社会各方面的更加远大的计划。
    我们知道，在你们的国家里，失业现象已经基本上没有了，工人的实际工资不断增加，人民群众的文化获得提高，各种形式的社会福利和社会保险在增加。这一切全都有助于贵国人民朝向社会主义迈进。
    亲爱的同志们，我们祝贺你们的成就，因为这些成就对国际工人运动起着巨大的影响，并给予意大利劳动者的斗争以极大的帮助。
    看到你们的成就，使得我国劳动者在反对本国垄断资本和资本家的日常斗争中得到了鼓舞和帮助。意大利劳动者认为并且确信有一天将走上与你们同样的道路。
    他们正在进行着一个不调和的斗争，争取增加工资、缩减工作时间，消除一支拥有二百万全部失业者的队伍和创造新的就业条件。同时，我们也必须为保卫意大利劳动者经过长期斗争获得的工会和民主权利而斗争。这些权利正受到意大利垄断资本家和帝国主义联合力量的威胁。意大利总工会在基层工会团结一致的标志之下领导着这些斗争，正像维多里奥同志最近在来比锡世界工会代表大会的讲台上所说的：一年半以来，我们在意大利领导了许多大规模的斗争。这些斗争是在参加我国三个总工会的各产业、各地方工会之间的统一行动的标志下，并根据各产业的具体要求而进行的。在所有这些斗争中，劳动者都获得了胜利。参加这些斗争的有二百万农业劳动者以及各种产业和重要公共事业：建筑、化学、五金、铁路、电车、邮电、煤气等等。总数将近四百万的劳动者参加了战斗性极强的统一罢工，通过团结一致的斗争，他们获得了经济上的重大改善。
    我们将在团结一致的条件下，为意大利劳动者和人民的切身利益继续进行工会活动。也在同样的团结一致的条件下，为保卫和平、反对一切战争挑衅者而继续斗争。
    同志们，我们和你们一起为维护和平而努力，你们在自己的国家中进行社会主义的和平建设，我们则为劳动阶级利益而进行斗争。你们和我们将继续前进，争取实现一个共同的目标：在全世界建设一个和平幸福的、花朵盛开的新社会。
    我们再次祝你们大会的工作获得巨大的成功。
    中国工会第八次全国代表大会万岁！
    人民中国的工人阶级和人民万岁！
    国际无产阶级团结友爱万岁！
                            意大利总工会书记处  桑蒂拉马
