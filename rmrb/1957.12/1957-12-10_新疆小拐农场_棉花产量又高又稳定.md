Xinhua News Agency report:

    Xinjiang Agricultural Production and Construction Corps' Xiaoguai Farm has maintained a stable cotton yield of over 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu for three consecutive years. Despite the abnormal climate during the cotton planting season this year, the farm's more than 6,500 mu of cotton still achieved an average yield of 343 jin of seed cotton per mu (approximately three jin of seed cotton equals one jin of ginned cotton), with 35 mu averaging 813 jin of seed cotton per mu.

    Xiaoguai Farm is located in the middle reaches of the Manas River in northern Xinjiang, and was reclaimed by People's Liberation Army soldiers in the spring of 1950. After eight years of labor, more than 20,000 mu of land have now been reclaimed.
