Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 3rd. The Dacheng First Cooperative in Gaoting Township, Yongxing County, Hunan Province, has set a new record this year for sweet potato production in mountainous areas, achieving a yield of 30,000 jin per mu. This cooperative has a total of 78 mu of sweet potatoes, with an average yield of over 9,000 jin per mu. Among them, 1.72 mu averaged 30,000 jin per mu, 10.7 mu averaged over 20,000 jin per mu, and more than 22 mu averaged 10,000 jin per mu. The cooperative plans to plant 80 mu of sweet potatoes in 1958, aiming for an average yield of 12,000 jin per mu, with 5 mu required to reach an average yield of 30,000 jin.

The Dacheng First Cooperative's usual annual sweet potato yield was only around 4,000 jin. This year, the cooperative adopted methods of sprouting seedlings in warm beds and cultivating strong seedlings by individual households. Immediately after the harvest of the first season crops, they took advantage of sunny days to dig up the sweet potato soil, generally to a depth of one foot to one foot two inches, with some soil dug to a depth of one foot five inches, more than twice as deep as the usual sweet potato soil. Furthermore, they planted the sweet potato seedlings ten days earlier, before the "Lesser Fullness" solar term, preventing the previous situation of missing the season due to drought. The amount of fertilizer applied to each sweet potato plant reached six to seven jin, more than double the usual amount. The news of the Dacheng First Cooperative's high-yield sweet potato production shocked the nearby agricultural cooperatives. When harvesting sweet potatoes, many cooperatives sent representatives to inspect and learn.

　　山区红薯谁第一？
    湖南省大城一社
    新华社长沙3日电　湖南省永兴县高亭乡大城一社今年创造了山区红薯亩产三万斤的最高纪录。这个社共有七十八亩红薯，平均每亩产九千多斤，其中有一点七二亩平均亩产三万斤，有十点七亩平均亩产两万斤以上，有二十二亩多平均亩产一万斤。全社计划在1958年种八十亩红薯，要求平均亩产一万二千斤，其中五亩产量要求达到平均三万斤。
    大城一社以往红薯的常年产量只有四千斤左右。今年，这个社采取温床催芽和分户培育壮秧的办法，在头季作物收获后就马上乘晴天挖薯土，一般深度是一尺到一尺二寸，有些土挖到一尺五寸深，比过去一般红薯土深一倍多，并且提前十天，在“小满”节前就插上红薯苗，防止了过去因旱等雨而错过季节的现象。每蔸红薯施肥量达到六、七斤，比一般施肥量增加两倍多。大城一社红薯高额丰产的消息震动了附近各农业社，收红薯时，很多社都派代表来验收和学习。
