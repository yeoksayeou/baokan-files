Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 14th. Many factories, mines, enterprises, schools and other units in Chongqing are turning over their year-end surplus funds to the national treasury. According to statistics from the Chongqing Branch of the Construction Bank: 26 units have already turned over 650,000 yuan of surplus funds to the national treasury, and another 90 units are in the process of completing the procedures for turning over surplus funds.

The cadre training class of the Municipal Bureau of Industry originally planned to build a dormitory costing 10,000 yuan. After overall planning, they utilized old houses and only spent 3,500 yuan on repairs. The Chaoyanghe Brick and Tile Factory actively sought to dispose of surplus materials after investment projects were reduced. These units have all recently turned over surplus funds to the national treasury.

Many units have carefully reviewed basic construction plans and corrected the erroneous plan of spending money hastily. The Sichuan Provincial Geological Bureau originally planned to purchase non-urgent equipment such as telescopes and film projectors; the Chongqing Geological School originally planned to use this year's surplus funds to build a laundry room. Now these plans have been cancelled, and the two units have turned over more than 140,000 yuan of surplus funds to the national treasury. The Sichuan-Hubei Branch of the Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry also reduced seven unnecessary equipment purchases such as computers, saving 8,000 yuan.

The Chongqing municipal Party and government leading organs have taken measures to stop the erroneous behavior of some units spending money hastily. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted inspections and dealt with seven units with particularly serious cases of wasting state funds. The Chongqing Municipal People's Committee also issued a notice in early December, requiring all units to conduct inspections to strictly prevent and stop the phenomenon of spending money hastily at the end of the year.

    重庆市许多单位做得对
    年终剩余资金上缴国库
    新华社重庆14日电　重庆市许多厂矿企业和学校等单位正在把年终剩余的资金上缴国库。据建设银行重庆分行统计：目前已有二十六个单位把多余的资金六十五万元上缴国库，另外还有九十个单位正在办理上缴多余资金的手续。
    市工业局干部训练班原计划修建造价一万元的宿舍一幢，经过统筹，利用了旧房子，只花了三千五百元的修缮费。朝阳河砖瓦厂在投资项目减少后，即积极设法处理多余材料。这些单位都在最近把多余资金上缴了国库。
    许多单位认真审核基本建设计划，纠正了突击花钱的错误打算。四川省地质局原打算购置望远镜、电影放映机等不急需的设备；重庆地质学校原计划利用今年多余的资金来建筑洗衣房。现在这些打算都已取消，两个单位已经把多余资金十四万多元上缴国库。冶金工业部地质局川鄂分局也削减了打算购买计算机等不必要的七项设备，节约了资金八千元。
    重庆市党政领导机关曾采取措施，制止了有些单位突击花钱的错误行为。中共重庆市委特别对浪费国家资金情节比较严重的七个单位进行了检查和处理。重庆市人民委员会也在12月上旬发出通知，要各单位进行检查，严格预防和制止年终突击花钱的现象。
