    新华社武汉5日电　大冶钢厂已经提前完成今年的国家计划。据统计，该厂总产值、劳动生产率和成本计划，早在10月底已经完成；上缴利润计划也已提前一个月完成；产量计划除个别产品要到12月上旬才能完成外，其他各种产品都已提前一个或两个月完成了年度计划。
    预计今年这个钢厂可以多给国家生产两万两千多吨钢、一万五千多吨钢材和五千多吨生铁；全年总产值将比第一个五年计划规定的水平提高四分之一强。今年以来，大冶钢厂职工深入地开展了增产节约运动，千方百计地设法克服了原材料供应不足的困难，先后推广了二十多项重大的先进经验，使生产水平和产品质量都有显著提高。职工们还提出了三百九十多条合理化建议，帮助解决了许多生产技术上的关键问题，仅其中能计算出节约价值的七十五条建议，就为国家创造了二十一万多元的财富。
    10月份该厂开始整风后，在10、11两个月中，全厂出现了许多整风、生产两不误的班组和个人。电炉车间电炉系统的工人，10月份创造了提前四天多全面完成月计划的新纪录，比计划增产了八百多吨钢、质量比过去任何一个月都好。
