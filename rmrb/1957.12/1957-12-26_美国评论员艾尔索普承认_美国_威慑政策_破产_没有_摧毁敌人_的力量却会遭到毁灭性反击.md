Xinhua News Agency, December 25th, New York Dispatch: The "New York Herald Tribune" published an article by Joseph Alsop on the 20th. The article effectively admits that the "deterrence policy" pursued by the United States has gone bankrupt.

He said that since the end of World War II, the entire strategy of the West has been placed on the "deterrent force" of the combination of American nuclear weapons and the means to project these weapons to distant targets. However, due to the United States' backwardness in missiles and the great development of the Soviet Union, this "deterrent force of the United States has in fact lost its offensive capability."

He said that the West's so-called "deterrent force has been greatly weakened," and that "no practical solution has been found" to stop this weakening.

Alsop said that "nuclear strike forces cannot be used against another country with nuclear strike forces." He pointed out that if the United States were to "attack," the other side would quickly retaliate, and the "attacker" would suffer devastating retaliation. Alsop said that Western countries no longer possess the "nuclear strike force" to "destroy the enemy." Moreover, the United States "Strategic Air Command can no longer hope to use its overseas air bases in an attack. Due to Soviet missiles, no country with such air bases would even consider allowing the air bases on its territory to be used for offensive purposes."

Alsop said that the United States now intends to deploy short-range missiles on the territory of NATO countries, "actually attempting to restore the offensive capabilities that the West has lost." But he admitted that "this method doesn't work either," because America's allies have expressed misgivings.

    美国评论员艾尔索普承认
    美国“威慑政策”破产
    没有“摧毁敌人”的力量却会遭到毁灭性反击
    新华社25日讯　纽约消息：“纽约先驱论坛报”20日刊载约瑟夫·艾尔索普的一篇文章。文章实际上承认，美国奉行的“威慑政策”已经破产。
    他说，自从第二次世界大战结束以来，西方的整个战略都放在美国的核武器加上把这种武器投到很远的目标去的手段两者结合起来的“威慑力量”上。但是由于美国在导弹方面落后而苏联有很大的发展，美国这种“威慑力量事实上已经失去了它的进攻能力”。
    他说，西方的所谓“威慑力量已经大大削弱”，而且对于如何制止这种削弱还“没有找到切实可行的办法”。
    艾尔索普说，“核进击力量不能够用来对付另一个拥有核进击力量的国家”。他指出，如果美国要“进攻”，对方就会迅速还击，“进攻者”将遭到毁灭性的反击。艾尔索普说，西方国家现在已不再拥有“摧毁敌人”的“核进击力量”了。而且美国“战略空军司令部不再可能希望在进攻中使用它的海外空军基地了。由于苏联的导弹，没有一个有这种空军基地的国家甚至会考虑允许在它境内的空军基地作为进攻之用”。
    艾尔索普说，美国现在打算在北大西洋公约国家的领土上设置短程导弹，“实际上是企图恢复西方已经失去的进攻的能力”。但是他承认，“这个办法也不灵”，因为美国的盟国表示疑惧。
