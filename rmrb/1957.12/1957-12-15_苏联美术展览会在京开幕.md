Xinhua News Agency, December 14th: A Soviet exhibition of prints, posters, book illustrations, and reproductions opened today at the Soviet Exhibition Center in Beijing.

The more than 800 works on display provide a general overview of the achievements made by the Soviet Union in the field of art publishing and the popularization of art works. The exhibition prominently features Lenin's famous saying "Art belongs to the people," and the content of the exhibition demonstrates the efforts made by Soviet artists in following Lenin's instructions.

The exhibition is divided into five parts. Among the prints are works by the most famous modern Soviet printmaker, the 80-year-old Favorsky, and the late A. Kravchenko. The book illustrations include many illustrations for world literary classics, and more than ten illustrations by the painter M. Pikov for the works of the ancient Chinese poets Du Fu and Bai Juyi, and the works of the great Chinese writer Lu Xun are also on display here.

Vice Minister of Culture Qian Junrui spoke at today's opening ceremony. He said: More than 20 years ago, Mr. Lu Xun began to introduce Russian and Soviet prints to the Chinese people. Chinese artists have learned from the excellent works of Soviet art in various aspects, and have learned the excellent tradition of socialist realism in Soviet plastic arts. He particularly emphasized the combination of high political content and high artistic quality in Soviet artistic creation. He pointed out that Chinese artists should especially learn from the Soviet artists' spirit of close contact with the masses of the people in their creative labor.

K. Kravchenko, one of the heads of the Moscow Artists Association, who came to China for the exhibition, introduced the content of the exhibition and the work of Soviet art. Soviet Embassy in China Counselor Sudarikov also attended the opening ceremony.
