　　Gas Engine

    A gas engine is a type of power machinery. It uses combustible gas produced from coal, charcoal, firewood, or rice husks in a gasifier as fuel. It can also directly use natural gas as fuel. The fuel burns inside the engine's cylinder, generating pressure that pushes the piston, producing power that is transmitted to the outside through connecting rods and crankshafts for people to use.

    Gas engines have a wide range of applications. In industry, they can be used as engines for automobiles and tractors, or to drive other machinery. In agricultural production, they can drive water pumps and waterwheels for irrigation or drainage of fields. They can also drive rice threshers, flour mills, cotton gins, and other rural sideline production equipment, and drive generators to provide lighting for rural areas. Using gas engines can solve and alleviate the problem of insufficient labor and animal power during busy farming seasons, and can complete tasks that human and animal power cannot handle.

    Currently, China is relatively short of petroleum, so diesel and gasoline engines cannot be widely promoted. Electric motors are limited by power sources and cannot be universally adopted. At present, we should mainly promote the use of solid fuel power machinery. Among this type of machinery, gas engines have many advantages. First, gas engines have higher thermal efficiency than steam engines (locomotives), and the same fuel can perform more work, thus saving fuel. Second, gas engines are lighter than locomotives, which can save a lot of steel. Third, gas engines are cheaper than locomotives, so the cost of pumping water for irrigation is lower. A rough calculation of several technical and economic indicators is shown in the table below:

　　Item               　  Unit  　Locomotive  　Gas Engine
　　Average Coal Consumption　  kg/horsepower-hour　  2.97  　0.7
　　Average Weight per Horsepower  　kg　         161.5  　44
　　Average Price per Horsepower  　Yuan (5-10 horsepower) 260-360  　230-240
　　Average Cost of Irrigating One Mu Once　  Yuan　    0.67  　0.52

    Fourth, the steel used to manufacture gas engines can be produced domestically with little problem, while the boiler steel plates used to manufacture locomotives are currently and will be difficult to supply domestically.

    Gas engines also have some disadvantages. For example, they have strict requirements for fuel; the machines themselves are relatively precise and complex, and operation, management, and maintenance are more troublesome. Therefore, operators and managers need to undergo a relatively long period of training.

　　煤气机
    煤气机是一种动力机械。它利用煤、木炭、木柴或稻糠在发生炉内发生出来的可燃气作燃料，也可以直接利用天然煤气作燃料。燃料在机器的汽缸内燃烧，就产生出压力来推动机器的活塞，产生动力，并且通过连杆、曲轴传到外面供人们使用。
    煤气机用途很广。在工业上可以作汽车、拖拉机的发动机，或者带动其他机械；在农业生产方面，可以带动水泵、水车来抽水灌田，或者排除田内积水；它还可以带动打稻机、磨粉机、轧花机等从事农村副业生产，带动发电机供农村照明。使用煤气机可以解决和缓和农忙时期劳畜力不足的问题，又可以完成一些人力、畜力不能胜任的工作。
    由于目前我国石油比较缺乏，柴油机、汽油机不能大量推广。电动机受电源限制，也不能普遍采用。当前主要应该推广使用固体燃料的动力机械。在这类机械中，煤气机有很多优点。第一、煤气机比蒸气机（锅驼机）热效率高，同样的燃料可作更多的工作，因此可以节省燃料。第二、煤气机比锅驼机的重量小，可以节省很多钢材。第三、煤气机比锅驼机价格低，抽水浇地的成本就比较便宜。粗略计算，几项技术经济指标如下表：
　　项目               　  单位  　锅驼机  　煤气机
　　平均煤耗量　  公斤／每马力小时　  2.97  　0.7
　　平均每马力重量  　公斤　         161.5  　44
　　平均每马力价格  　元（5—10马力）260—360  　230—240
　　平均每亩浇地一次的成本　  元　    0.67  　0.52
    第四、制造煤气机所用的钢材，国内生产起来问题不大，制造锅驼机所用的锅炉钢板，目前和今后国内供应起来都比较困难。
    煤气机也有一些缺点。例如，对燃料的要求比较严格；机器本身比较精密复杂，操作、管理、维修比较麻烦，因此操作、管理人员需要经过较长时间的培训。
