Seeing Venus at Dusk
Wen Lin

　　For many days now, whenever the sun has just set, and night is approaching while the stars have not yet appeared, a conspicuous star has been the first to shine in the southwestern sky. She is large and bright, much like a small lantern, appearing exceptionally beautiful and moving against the backdrop of the hazy twilight. Our ancestors once called her the evening star.

　　However, sometimes before dawn, there is also such a bright star in the eastern sky, and people have named her the morning star. According to ancient Chinese sayings, this is called "Eastern enlightenment, Western long-lasting glow".

　　But, I wonder if you have already noticed that whenever the evening star appears, the morning star disappears; and as soon as the morning star appears, you can no longer find the evening star. What is the reason for this? Obviously, there must be some relationship between them. People spent a long time observing and researching before discovering that these two stars were originally one, which modern astronomers call "Venus."

　　Venus and our Earth are neighbors and brothers. They are called neighbors because Venus, Earth, and many other planets live peacefully in the Sun's large family, and they each move in an orderly manner according to the path prescribed by "Universal Gravitation". Venus and Earth are called brothers because they are very similar. In terms of mass, density, weight, and volume, Venus and Earth are almost the same.

　　Venus is much closer to the sun than Earth, so naturally, its orbit is smaller. We have only passed two hundred and twenty-five days and nights on Earth, and Venus has already completed one revolution around the sun. Venus is also constantly rotating on its own axis, and one rotation takes about the same amount of time as thirty days on Earth.

　　Why can Venus only be seen in the morning or evening?

　　The great Polish scientist Copernicus first explained this reason. He said that because Venus, like Earth, revolves around the sun. However, Venus is closer to the sun than Earth, and its orbit is inside the Earth's orbit. Therefore, when we look at Venus from Earth, she is sometimes on the same side as the sun and sometimes on the other side. This is why sometimes she appears in the east a little earlier than the sun; and other times we have to wait until the sun has set before we can see her.

　　Looking at Venus with the naked eye, you only feel that she is dazzling and extremely beautiful. It is even more interesting to look at Venus with a telescope. Who was the first to look at Venus with a telescope? It was the Italian scientist Galileo. Back in the early 17th century, Galileo aimed his handmade telescope at Venus, and he was immediately surprised because what he saw in the telescope resembled a crescent moon. So, he began to pay attention to this strange planet. What was the result? The "crescent" slowly widened, then became a semi-circle, and later the semi-circle gradually protruded, finally turning into a bright round face, just like the moon on the 15th of each month!

　　Of course, today this is nothing rare. Many people can explain the reason for this change in phases, just like the moon because sometimes we see the side of Venus that is illuminated by the sun, and sometimes we only see a part of it. But, how much effort did scientists put in to understand this phenomenon back then!

　　Venus's brilliance is the most attractive. But can you explain the reason why?

　　This is because Venus is relatively close to both the sun and the Earth, plus the Venusian atmosphere has a very strong ability to reflect sunlight.

　　Venus also has an atmosphere surrounding its surface, which naturally makes it even more like Earth. However, the main reason hindering our understanding of the Venusian surface world is precisely this atmosphere. This thick atmosphere tightly surrounds Venus, making it difficult for us to see the true face of Venus. However, the light coming from Venus reveals the secrets of the Venusian atmosphere. Astronomers have analyzed the spectrum of Venus and found that the composition of the Venusian atmosphere is basically carbon dioxide. Until now, no traces of oxygen and water vapor have been found.

　　Venus is closer to the sun, so it must not be as cold as Mars. Some people estimate that the climate on Venus may be similar to the subtropical zone on Earth. If there is sufficient water on Venus, it would be very suitable for plant life because the Venusian atmosphere contains abundant carbon dioxide, which is the raw material for plants to carry out photosynthesis.

　　There is no oxygen on Venus, which is unfavorable for animal life.

　　If you are interested in this beautiful star, then please pay attention to observation. December 24th will be the brightest day for Venus. At that time, she will be fifteen times brighter than Sirius, the brightest star in the sky. On that night, the new moon and the bright star will compete for beauty, what a moving scene it will be in the night sky!

　　Soviet scientists have already begun to study interplanetary rockets that will fly to the Moon, Mars, and Venus. Traveling to Venus is no longer a fantasy but a reality that will soon appear in life.

### 黄昏看金星

　　黄昏看金星
　　文霖
    已经好多日子了，每当太阳刚刚落山，夜幕将临而群星尚未露面的时候，在西南方的天空中，一颗惹人注意的星星就先亮起来了。她，又大、又亮，多么像是一盏小灯笼，在暮霭苍茫的夜空衬托之下，显得格外美丽动人。我们的祖先，曾经把她叫做昏星。
    然而，有时黎明前，在东方的天空也有这样一颗明亮的星星，人们给她起名“晨星”。照我国古代的说法，这叫做“东有启明，西有长庚”。
    但是，不知道你是不是已经注意到：每当昏星出现的时候，晨星就失踪了；而只要晨星一露面，你就无论如何再也不能找到昏星。这是什么道理？显然，她们之间，一定有着什么关系。人们经过很长时间的观察和研究，才发现这两颗星星，原本是一颗，现代天文学家把她叫做“金星”。
    金星和我们的地球是邻居，也是兄弟。说是邻居，是因为金星、地球以及别的许多行星，大家相安无事的居住在太阳的大家庭里，她们各自依照“万有引力”给规定下的行程，有秩序地运动着；说金星和地球是兄弟，是因为它们很相似，在质量上、密度上、重量上、体积上，金星和地球都差不多。
    金星离太阳比地球要近的多，自然她兜的圈子就小，我们在地球上才过了二百二十五个昼夜，金星已经绕太阳转完一周。金星也在不停地自转，它自转一周的时间，和地球上的三十天差不多一样长。
    为什么只有在早晨或黄昏的时候，才能看到金星呢？
    十六世纪伟大的波兰科学家哥白尼首先解释了这个道理。他说，因为金星也和地球一样，绕着太阳转圈子。然而，金星却比地球离太阳近，它的轨道，又是在地球的轨道里面。这样，我们从地球上看金星，她就有时在太阳这面，有时在太阳那面。这也就是为什么有时候她比太阳稍早一些出现在东方；而另一些时候又得等太阳落山以后，我们才能看到她。
    用肉眼看金星，只觉得她光彩夺目，美丽极了。要是用望远镜看金星，那才有趣呢。是谁，第一次用望远镜去看金星呢？是意大利的科学家伽利略。那还是在十七世纪初期，伽利略把自己亲手制造出来的望远镜对准了金星，他立刻惊讶起来了。因为他在望远镜里看到的金星酷似一钩弯弯的蛾眉月。于是，他开始注意这颗奇怪的行星。结果怎样呢？“蛾眉”慢慢地变宽了，接着成了半圆形，以后半圆形又逐渐凸出，终于变成了一个明亮的圆面，多么像是每月15日晚上的月亮阿！
    当然，这在今天说来，并不是什么稀罕事了，很多人都可以说得出，这种圆缺变化的原因和月亮一样，因为我们有时看到金星被太阳照亮的一面，而有时却只是看到了一部分。可是，当初科学家为了弄清这种现象曾经付出多少劳动啊！
    金星的光彩夺目，是最引人的。然而你能说得出道理何在吗？
    这是由于金星离太阳和地球都比较近，加上金星大气层有一种很强烈地反射太阳的本领。
    金星表面也有大气层包围，自然这就更像地球了。然而，阻碍着我们认识金星表面世界的主要原因，也正是这个大气层。这一层厚厚的大气，严密地包围了金星，使得我们难见金星的真面目。然而，从金星上来的光线，却泄露了金星大气的秘密。天文学家分析了金星光谱，发现金星大气的成分基本上是二氧化碳。直到现在，还没有找到氧气和水蒸气的踪迹。
    金星离太阳较近，它上面一定不会像火星那样寒冷。有人估计，金星上的气候可能和地球上的亚热带差不多。如果金星上水分充足的话，倒是很适合植物生活的。因为在金星大气中含有丰富的二氧化碳，这是植物进行光合作用的原料。
    金星上，没有氧气，这对动物生活是不利的。
    如果你对这颗美丽的星星有兴趣的话，那就请你注意观察吧，12月24日，将是金星最亮的日子。那时，她比天空最亮的恒星——天狼星还要亮十五倍。那天晚上，新月与明星争艳，这该是一幅多么动人的夜空的景象啊！
    苏联科学家已经在开始研究飞到月亮、火星和金星上的星际火箭了。到金星去旅行，已不是幻想，而是不久以后即将出现在生活中的现实。
