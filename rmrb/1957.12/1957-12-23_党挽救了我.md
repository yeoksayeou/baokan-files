The Party Saved Me
Liu Jiemei

In the past few months, I have received more than seventy letters. Some of these letters came from various counties in Hubei, and some came from provinces such as Beijing, Liaoning, Shanxi, Anhui, and Jiangxi. Some were the teachings of the elderly, and some were the hopes of young people and children for me. Tears welled up as I read these letters, because every sentence touched my heart. After the exhibition of my past and present life in Beijing, many visitors wrote these words in the guestbook, hoping that I would completely change. A few days ago, when I made a self-criticism and expressed my determination to correct my mistakes in the cinema of the exhibition, an old man with a white beard stepped forward and said loudly to me: "I entrust you with four words: practice what you preach!" This made me even more moved. Now, I will report on my transformation process, hoping that everyone will further help me, so that I, who have made great mistakes, can completely transform and become a strong socialist fighter.

Capitalist Ideas are More Stinking than Dog Shit

The day after the Huanggang County Three-Level Cadre Conference ended—September 13th—I attended the county's winter planting meeting. In the past, all six guidance station chiefs greeted me with smiles; this time, many people ignored me. They all talked among themselves, and were silent when they saw me. Although I made a self-criticism at the Three-Level Cadre Conference, everyone's anger towards me had not yet dissipated, and they had not seen any of my actual actions. At this time, I felt like I was being cut by a knife. How stinking is capitalist ideology! If I don't dig it out completely, I will become a stinking pile of dog shit. At this time, Director Zhang of our Agricultural Bureau saw that I was very depressed and asked me, "How do you feel?" I said, "I have two things on my mind, one is that I am sorry for the masses and have no face to see them; the other is that I am sorry for the Party. The Party has spent so much effort to educate me, but I was dishonest to the Party in the past, my words and thoughts were different. Now I feel very sad when I think about it." Director Zhang encouraged me and said, "As long as you truly transform, the comrades will see it, and everyone will still trust you."

Opened My Eyes

Before the winter planting meeting was over, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee wanted me to go to them. When I met with Comrade Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee, and talked about my past of starting to exploit and lend money, Secretary Zhang asked, "Why do you only remember the freedom to borrow and lend after the land reform, but not the mutual aid and cooperation?" As he spoke, he found a copy of Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" for me to read. I read this book for three days, and the more I read it, the clearer I became.

While living in the province, the Provincial Party Committee sent someone to take me to see the Yangtze River Bridge. When I walked on the bridge and looked around, wow! It was so far! When I looked down, the boats were like a flock of ducks being herded! This was incredible, socialist construction is truly great! Previously, my eyes seemed to be covered by something, and I couldn't see what national industrialization was like. This time, I opened my eyes wide, and it felt like a heavy weight had been lifted from my heart. Later, I went to visit the East Lake History Museum, which exhibited how labor creates people and labor creates the world. In the feudal society section, I saw some exploiters living corrupt lives, while other exploited people were begging everywhere, just like I used to be. No wonder some people were poor, wasn't it all the fault of these exploiting classes! The more I looked, the angrier I became, and the more I hated it! Looking back, I also lent money in the past. If it weren't for the Party's rescue, wouldn't I be like these people! This reminded me again.

When attending the Provincial Direct Organs Cadre Conference, Governor Zhang Tixue asked me where I had gone to play after arriving in Wuhan. I said I had seen the bridge. He said, "How does this compare to your plan for four hundred and sixty piculs of grain (from lending)?" I said, "Four hundred and sixty piculs of grain can't even buy a pillar." He asked again, "If you only had those four hundred and sixty piculs of grain, could you still have this bridge?" I couldn't quite grasp the point for a moment and didn't answer. He continued, "Think about it, if you only care about getting rich, would you have this bridge?" This time I understood: wasn't it true that during the Kuomintang rule, everyone only cared about getting rich themselves? I heard they had been talking about building the bridge for decades, but it was never built. With socialism, it was built all at once. The meeting began, and I told the comrades about my ideological changes. After I finished speaking, many comrades gathered around to shake hands with me, welcoming my transformation. My heart felt like a fire was burning, warm and happy, and tears were about to come out. I thought to myself: if the Party hadn't rescued me quickly, and I had continued down the wrong path, would the comrades treat me like this now? No matter what, I can't leave the collective or leave the Party in the future, I want to stick closely to the Party!

Debate in the Family

Later, Hubei Daily published a special column discussing my ideological transformation. I carefully read these articles, and the more I read them, the deeper my understanding became. When I went home, I read these articles to my father and my wife. My father said, "Every sentence is good. You never listened to what I said before. If you are still like that now, I won't allow it." My wife was still not honest, and instead blamed me: "Who told you to do things wrong?" When she said this, I got angry: "What do you mean! You only blame others, not yourself. It's a shame you made a public self-criticism in the Hubei Daily. Your self-criticism was fake, some of the words weren't true; I get angry when I see your self-criticism. Where have you dug out the roots of your thinking?" My father got angry when he heard this and went to sleep in the room. I said without hesitation: "You can't think the way you used to, you have to work hard, and each person has to have their own plans. If you don't change, I'll bring my sisters and nephews to have a meeting to discuss it." Only then did she soften her tone and say, "Things have already been done wrong, don't blame me. I've already thought about changing, and I've made three plans: one is to participate in labor in the cooperative; one is to do a good job in household sideline production; and the other is to stop wearing makeup." And she expressed her determination to do it. Sure enough, that night she went to the production team leader and contracted to pick one dou and one sheng of cotton. The next day, she took her child to the field. Then she bought two piglets to raise. She hadn't participated in production since 1954. Now that she was like this, my father was also very happy and said, "I'm relieved."

To Plan the Big Socialist Calculation

In early November, I arrived in Beijing. One day, I met Vice Chairman Zhu De. When I met him, my heart was leaping, and I was so happy that I couldn't even speak. It wasn't until Vice Chairman Zhu said, "This is a very good lesson for you!" that I came to my senses. Vice Chairman Zhu asked, "How old are you this year?" I said, "Thirty-six years old." Vice Chairman Zhu continued, "You can still do a lot!" My heart suddenly warmed, and it felt like ten thousand rays of sunshine appeared before my eyes. I felt that I still had a great future; but then I thought, if I followed Cao Qizhai's path, it wouldn't be long. Vice Chairman Zhu also said, "Your calculations are too small. There are many exhibitions in Beijing, go and see them everywhere, see how good the Soviet Union is!" He also said, "Our China will be built the most beautifully in the future!" These words of Vice Chairman Zhu completely illuminated my heart, and washed away all the messy things in my heart! I want to engrave these words in my heart and never forget them. In the past, I only made small personal calculations, and couldn't see the affairs of the whole country, that's why I ended up in that situation. In the future, I want to calculate for the country and for the people, to plan the big socialist calculation. What is the value of small personal calculations! How ugly! I kept thinking about Vice Chairman Zhu's words, and didn't fall asleep all night. Especially when I thought about the lending, I felt that I was too ugly. I was determined to correct my mistakes. I have already written letters to Liu Mingjiang and Tao Renqing, who I exploited, to apologize and make a self-criticism; after I go back, I will return the interest I exploited from them. From now on, I want to be a party member who truly serves the people.

### 党挽救了我

    党挽救了我
    刘介梅
    最近几个月内，我收到七十多封信。这些信，有的来自湖北各县，有的来自北京、辽宁、山西、安徽、江西等省，有的是老人的教诲，有的是青年和小朋友们对我的希望。这些信我看着看着眼泪就来了，因为句句话都打动了我的心。我的今昔生活对比展览会在北京展出后，很多参观的人在留言簿上也写着这些话，希望我彻底转变。几天前，我在展览会的电影馆里向观众作检讨、表示决心改正错误的时候，一位白胡子老大爷上前高声对我说：“嘱咐你四个字：说到做到！”这使我更加感动。现在，把我转变的过程作个汇报，希望大家进一步帮助我，使我这个犯过大错误的人彻底地转变过来，作一个坚强的社会主义战士。
    资本主义思想比狗屎还臭
    黄冈县三级干部会议结束的第二天——9月13日，我参加了县的冬播会议。往日，六个指导站长见面都跟我有说有笑；这回见面，好些人不理我。他们到一块个个说话，见了我就不做声。因为我虽然在三级干部会上作了检讨，但是大家对我的气还没消完，并且大家也没有看到我的什么实际行动。这时候，我心里像刀子割。资本主义思想多臭啊！要不把它挖干净，我就成了臭狗屎。这时候，我们农业局张局长见我很苦闷，就问我：“心里怎么样？”我说：“心里有两件事，一件是对不住群众，没有脸见人；再一件就是对不住党，党花这么大气力教育我，我过去对党不老实，口里和心里不一样，现在想起来很难过。”张局长鼓励我说：“只要你真正的转变了，同志们是看得到的，大家还是会信任你的。”
    打开了眼界
    冬播会没开完，湖北省委就要我去他们那里。当我见到省委书记处书记张平化同志，说到我过去开始剥削放债的事情的时候，张书记问：“你怎么只记得土地改革后借贷自由，就不记得互助合作呢？”说着他便找了一本毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告给我看。我把这本书看了三天，越看心里越明白。
    在省里住着的时候，省委又派人引我去看长江大桥。走到桥上一望，啊嗬！好远哪！再往下一看，船啰，像放排鸭子一样！这还了得，社会主义建设真伟大！先前我的眼睛像给什么东西遮住了一样，看不到国家工业化是个什么样，这一看，开了个大眼界，心里像掉了个沉重的东西，后来又到东湖历史博物馆去参观，这里展览的是劳动创造人，劳动创造世界。在封建社会那部分里，看到有一些剥削人的人，过着腐化的日子，另一些受剥削的人，到处讨饭，跟我过去一样。怪不得有人受穷，不就是这些剥削阶级作的怪吗！ 我越看越有气，越看越恨！回头一想，我先前也放了债，要不是党挽救，不也跟这些人一样！这下子又提醒了我。
    在参加省直属机关干部大会的时候，张体学省长问我到武汉以后，上哪些地方去玩了。我说看过了大桥。他说：“这比你那四百六十石谷子的（放债）计划怎样？”我说：“四百六十石谷子还买不到一根柱子。”他又问：“要了你那四百六十石谷子，还能再有这个桥？ ”我心里还一时转不过弯来，没有回答。他接着说：“你想想，要是只顾个人发财，会不会有这个桥？”这一下我才明白了：不是么，国民党统治的时候，个个只顾自己发财，听说叫了几十年要修大桥，就没修起来，有了社会主义，一下子就修起来了。会开始了，我向同志们讲了我的思想变化，讲完以后，很多同志围拢来和我握手，欢迎我的转变。我心里像起了一团火，热烘烘的，感动得眼泪都要出来了。心想：要不是党挽救得快，照错路笔直走下去，现在同志们会这样对待我吗？ 我今后不管怎样也不能离开集体，离开党，我要跟党贴得紧紧的！
    家庭里的辩论
    后来，湖北日报辟了专栏讨论我的思想转变。我仔细地看了这些文章，越看体会越深。我回家去的时候，就把这些文章读给我父亲和我老婆听。父亲说：“句句都是好话，我从前说的你们都不听，现在要还是那样，我是不依的。”我老婆还不老实，反转来光说我：“哪个叫你把事做错了的？”她这一说，我就起了火：“怎么的呀！ 你光说别人，不说自己，亏你在湖北日报上公开检讨。你那是假检讨，有些话不实在；看到你那检讨我就有气。你的思想根子哪里挖出来了？”我父亲听到这里也生了气，钻到房里去睡了。我就毫不客气地说：“再不能像往日那样想，要着劲劳动，各人要有各人的打算。你要不改，我就把妹妹们、外甥们接来开会讨论。”她这才软了劲，说：“事已做错了，也莫怨我吧。我已经想转来了，并作了三个打算：一个是参加社里劳动；一个是把家庭副业搞好；再一个就是不搽粉了。”并表示要坚决做到。果然，她当天夜里就去找生产队长，包下了捡一斗一升地的棉花的工。第二天，她带着孩子下地了。接着又买了两个奶猪回来养着。从1954年起，她就没参加过生产。现在这样，我父亲看了也很高兴地说：“我放心了”。
    要打社会主义的大算盘
    11月初，我到了北京。有一天，见到了朱德副主席。见面时我的心直朝上蹦，喜欢得连话也说不出来。直到朱副主席说：“这对你是一次很好的教训啰！”我才清醒过来。朱副主席问：“今年多大年纪？”我说：“三十六岁了。”朱副主席接着说：“还很能干一下子！”我心里猛的一热，眼前像出现万道霞光，觉得自己还很有前途；可是又想到，要是照曹其斋的路走下去，就不长了。朱副主席又说：“你那算盘太小了。北京有很多展览会，到处去看看，看看苏联多好！”他又说：“我们中国将来要建设得最漂亮！”朱副主席的这些话，把我的心全照亮了，把我心里的一些乱七八糟的东西都洗刷干净了！我要把这些话刻在心肝上，永世不忘。过去，我就是光打个人的小算盘，看不到整个国家的事，才走到那种地步的。今后，要为国家、为人民打算盘，打社会主义的大算盘。个人的小算盘值什么呀！真丑！我一直想着朱副主席的话，一夜没睡着。特别是一想起放债的事，就觉得自己太丑了。我下定决心改正错误。我已经给被我剥削过的刘明江、陶仁青写了信，向他们道了歉、作了检讨；回去以后就把剥削他们的利息退给他们。从今以后，我要做个真正为人民服务的党员。
