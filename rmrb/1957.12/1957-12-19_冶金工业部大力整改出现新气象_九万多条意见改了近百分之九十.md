Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: The rectification work of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is progressing rapidly, and a new atmosphere has emerged in the organs.

The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry earnestly implemented the mass line in the rectification process, concentrating the 91,500 suggestions put forward by the masses and then distributing them to the masses again to discuss and resolve them together. As of December 11th, 87.5% had been rectified, with two-thirds of the units reaching over 90%.

During the rectification, leading cadres seriously and earnestly treated the criticisms from the masses. Now, the chiefs and deputy chiefs of divisions and bureaus who were criticized in the ministry have generally given explanations and made self-criticisms to the masses, and there has been a significant change in the leadership style. The masses in the Design Bureau used to criticize the leadership for being "stuck in piles of documents and unable to get out." Now, several bureau chiefs have established a system of regularly going deep into the design institutes. In the past, the chiefs and deputy chiefs of divisions and bureaus rarely went to the large dormitories of the masses. Now, they take time to go to the single dormitories to talk with the masses. The Nonferrous Metals Bureau has stipulated a system of receiving the masses every Friday. In the past three months or so, the director and chiefs of the bureau have had conversations with more than 300 people, which has satisfied the masses.

In the rectification process, leaders and the masses closely integrated to discuss problems, and many problems were solved, saving a large amount of material wealth for the country. The ministry originally planned to invest 17 million yuan in basic construction costs other than industry and housing for the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company. After re-examination by the masses and further research by the leaders, it has been reduced to 8.5 million yuan, which is nearly half less than the original plan. The ministry originally decided to build a small copper mine in a certain place. The chief designer of the Nonferrous Metals Design Institute originally planned an investment of 6 million yuan. This time, the leaders organized the designers to discuss and decided to reduce it to 4 million yuan. The institute is currently actively studying a new plan to further reduce it by more than 1 million yuan. The Nonferrous Metals Research Institute lost seven platinum crucibles and four platinum hammers worth 7,000 yuan for more than a year, and no one had ever investigated. The person in charge of managing the warehouse had no choice but to write it off. This time, the masses revealed the matter, and it was decided to thoroughly investigate and find it. As a result, it was found.

Through the rectification movement, the enthusiasm of the masses has been greatly increased, and work efficiency has improved. In the past, a few cadres in some units were late for work and left early, read books and newspapers casually at work, and ate things casually. Now, this phenomenon has been greatly reduced. In the past, people from various places came to the ministry to handle affairs and always stayed for several days, delaying resolution. Now, they can generally resolve problems quickly. A cadre recently sent by the Four-Zero-One Factory of the Nonferrous Metals Bureau said: Last year, they sent people to Beijing to handle three matters and stayed for seven days. This time, three matters of the same nature were completed in a few hours.

During the rectification, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry also dealt with many bad people and bad deeds that were previously unknown due to the large organization and lack of communication between upper and lower levels. After being exposed by the masses, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has expelled sixty-three bad elements, all of whom have committed serious crimes such as theft, embezzlement, swindling, and moral corruption.

After this stage of rectification, the leadership of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry deeply felt the harm of having too many layers in the organs and having too many redundant personnel. This time, the leaders discussed with the masses and decided to merge the bureaus, abolish the administrative bureau structure, and reduce the original 4,000 people in the headquarters by more than 2,000. This plan was announced to the masses on the 14th.

Currently, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is conducting a comprehensive review work consisting of a mass general review and leadership spot checks. According to the inspection, about 20% of the problems that have been rectified are matters of explanation and reference, and may not be thoroughly or seriously rectified. This is the focus of this review.

### 冶金工业部大力整改出现新气象  九万多条意见改了近百分之九十

    冶金工业部大力整改出现新气象
    九万多条意见改了近百分之九十
    新华社17日讯　冶金工业部的整改工作正在迅速进展，现在机关里已经出现了一种新的气象。
    冶金工业部在整改中认真贯彻群众路线，把群众提出来的九万一千五百条意见集中起来，再分别交给群众，和群众一起讨论解决。到本月11日为止，已经整改了87.5％，其中三分之二的单位达到90％以上。
    在整改中，领导干部认真严肃地对待群众的批评，现在部里被提意见的处、局长，一般都向群众作了交代和进行了检讨，领导作风已有明显的转变。设计局的群众过去批评领导上“钻在公文堆里出不来”，现在几个局长已规定了经常深入到各设计院的制度。过去处、局长们都极少到群众的大宿舍里去，现在他们抽出时间到单身宿舍里同群众谈心。有色局规定每星期五接见群众的制度，最近三个多月来，这个局的局长和处长已经和三百多群众进行了交谈，群众很满意。
    在整改中，领导和群众密切结合讨论问题，许多问题得到解决，已为国家节省大量物质财富。这个部原计划对武汉钢铁公司除了工业、住宅之外的其他基本建设费用投资一千七百万元，这次经过群众重新审核和领导的进一步研究，已降低到八百五十万元，比原计划减少了将及一半。部里原决定在某地建设一个小铜矿，有色金属设计院的设计总负责人原计划方案投资六百万元，这次领导上组织设计人员讨论，决定降低到四百万元，院里目前还在积极研究再降低一百多万元的新方案。有色研究所有价值七千元的七个白金坩锅和四个白金锤丢了一年多，从没有人追查过，管理仓库的人没办法，也就把它销了账，这次群众揭发了这件事情，决定彻底追查一定要把它找到，结果找到了。
    通过整改运动，群众的积极性高涨起来了，工作效率提高了。过去有些单位的少数干部迟到早退、上班随便看书报、随便吃东西，现在这种现象大大减少。过去各地派人来部办事，总是一呆好几天，拖延不能解决，现在一般都能很快解决问题。有色局四零一厂最近派来的一个干部说：去年他们派人来北京办三件事住了七天，这次同样性质的三件事几个钟头就办完了。
    在整改中，冶金部还处理了过去由于机构庞大，上下不通，因而也无从知道的许多坏人坏事。经过群众揭发，冶金部已开除了六十三个坏分子，他们都是具有严重盗窃贪污、招摇撞骗、道德败坏等犯罪行为的人。
    经过这一阶段的整改，冶金部领导上深深感到机关层次多和人浮于事的危害性，这次领导上和群众一起讨论，决定部局合并，取消管理局机构，将本部原来的四千人精简两千多人，并在14日向群众宣布了这个方案。
    现在，冶金部正在进行一次群众普查和领导抽查的全面复查工作。据检查，已整改的问题当中约有20％是属于解释和参考注意的，可能改得不彻底不认真，这是此次复查的重点。
