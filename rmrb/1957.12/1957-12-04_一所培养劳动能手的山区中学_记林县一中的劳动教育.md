　　A Mountainous Middle School Cultivating Labor Experts
　　——On the Labor Education of Linxian No. 1 Middle School
　　Sun Jingchao
    In recent years, Linxian No. 1 Middle School in Henan Province has deeply understood the Party's education policy, adhered to the traditional spirit of running schools diligently and thriftily in the old liberated areas, improved teaching work, and strengthened labor education, enabling them to achieve great results in teaching and education.

    Linxian is located in the Taihang Mountains and is an old liberated area. The predecessor of Linxian No. 1 Middle School was Linxian Normal School, established in the autumn of 1946, the first secondary school built in this mountainous area.

    When the school was first established, it was very small, with only one class of thirty students. At that time, the War of Liberation had just begun, and the supply of all materials was very difficult. The school only had a few old houses confiscated from landlords. Many other facilities, such as building cooking stoves, mud blackboards, weaving mats for sleeping, sawing wood to make tables and benches, were all made by the students themselves. At that time, because the funds allocated from above were very small, some of the school's expenses had to be subsidized by organizing students to produce, such as reclaiming wasteland to grow vegetables and grain, driving carts to sell coal, and ginning cotton for others. Therefore, from the beginning, the school established a good atmosphere of running schools diligently and thriftily and respecting labor.

    In 1953, Linxian Normal School was changed to a regular middle school. Because the Party attached great importance to this school in the old area, it allocated funds for expansion. The school developed rapidly and is now a school with more than a thousand students. Since the school was changed to a regular middle school, the school's administrative leaders have always attached great importance to the implementation of labor education. After four years of arduous exploration, they have accumulated many valuable experiences in their work.

          Vivid Biology Lessons

    An important characteristic of the school's biology class is that it can be combined with the characteristics of the local rural area for teaching. Biology teachers usually attach great importance to contacting local labor models, veteran farmers, technical guidance stations, farms, silkworm farms, and the county's production leadership organs to learn about local production and learn practical production knowledge. When lecturing, they pay attention to using local examples to illustrate the knowledge in books. When talking about deep plowing to increase production, in addition to explaining the general principles, the teachers also introduced the example of Chen Yulin Cooperative in the county, which achieved bumper harvests due to deep plowing: In 1951, deep plowing seven inches, yield of 360 jin per mu; in 1952, deep plowing eight inches, yield of 480 jin per mu; in 1953, deep plowing ten inches, yield of 600 jin per mu. At the same time, it was explained that deep plowing must be appropriate, gradually increasing the depth. Plowing too deeply at one time would not only fail to increase production but would also reduce it. Then the teacher cited the lesson of the Xiashen Street Cooperative, which unilaterally accepted deep plowing technology and turned the soil to a depth of one and a half feet, resulting in a lower yield than plowing three or four inches deep. The textbook states that the sowing time for millet is from Beginning of Summer to Grain in Ear, they changed it to Grain Rain to Beginning of Summer; the row spacing of millet is 35-60 centimeters, they changed it to 20-30 centimeters. Also, fertilization, seed selection, silkworm rearing, etc., they all combined with local characteristics to teach students to learn and master scientific knowledge in practical operation.

    When lecturing, teachers not only pay attention to using local production examples to illustrate the knowledge in books, but also pay attention to combining with reality to clarify the Party's important policies. When teaching the lesson on multiple cropping and crop rotation, the teacher first generally introduced the principle that appropriate multiple cropping and crop rotation can increase production, and then explained that China cannot reclaim large areas of wasteland at present. Both the First Five-Year Plan and the Second Five-Year Plan pointed out that the main way to increase agricultural production is to appropriately increase the area of multiple cropping and increase the yield per unit area. At the same time, they introduced the practical significance of implementing rational crop rotation in the local area. At present, about 40% of the cultivated land area in Linxian still uses the old cropping system, and can only harvest three crops of wheat, sweet potatoes or cotton, and spring millet in two years. If a new cropping system is implemented, two crops can be harvested a year, greatly increasing the yield. To prove the correctness of this conclusion, the teacher further introduced the example of the Koutou Village Agricultural Cooperative in Huanghua Township, where one mu of land implemented a new cropping system, which increased production by 412 jin of grain compared to the old cropping system under the same natural conditions. The students were very interested in listening.

    In addition, teachers also pay attention to combining with the reality that rural students generally have certain agricultural knowledge, so some places are emphasized, while others are taught more simply. When teaching about wheat, the teachers learned in advance that the students have certain techniques and experience in wheat sowing and management, but lack knowledge about seed selection, seed treatment, the growth process, and harrowing wheat fields in the spring, so the teachers explained these issues more thoroughly.

          Various Experimental Activities

    School teachers also use experimental activities to enable students to master agricultural production techniques in practical operation, cultivate an interest in engaging in agricultural production, and lay the foundation for engaging in agricultural production.

    Sericulture is an important sideline in mountainous areas. Under the guidance of teachers, the animal group experimented with high-temperature rapid sericulture. Because the temperature, humidity, feed, and ventilation were properly controlled, the results were very good. They experimented with one-seventh of a silkworm egg sheet, and the silkworm rearing time was shortened from 43 days to 23 days. Each silkworm egg sheet can harvest 70 jin of cocoons, creating a very high record. "Biology Bulletin" introduced their high-temperature rapid sericulture method last year. Their Laihang chickens lay eggs even at minus 15 degrees Celsius, producing 280 eggs a year, which is 30 more than the standard introduced in the book. They also raised several kinds of rabbits.

    The experimental garden is divided into eleven areas. There are many things tested in the experimental garden, with more than 70 kinds of plants. The content of the experiment is determined according to the teaching syllabus, combined with the local situation and students' knowledge level. The main crops in the local area are wheat, sweet potatoes, corn, and cotton, so the plant group conducted experiments on these crops. They experimented with sweet potato warm water soaking, high-temperature seedling raising, scaffolding, and moonflower grafting; they conducted comparative experiments on wheat with soda soaking, warm water soaking, and no soaking, as well as comparative experiments on mixed fertilizers and foliar fertilization. Wheat soaked in baking soda and wheat with increased application of phosphate fertilizer at sowing both increased production by more than 20%; a sweet potato grafted with moonflower last year weighed as much as 12 jin, which shocked Linxian. It was the most eye-catching exhibit in the county's agricultural exhibition.

    All experimental activities in the experimental garden, from plowing, seed selection, intertillage, fertilization to harvesting, are carried out by subject groups under the direct guidance of biology teachers. The whole land preparation, intertillage, and daily management are based on the team members as the backbone, and mobilize all students to do it together. Teachers have this experience: giving students a hundred lectures is not as good as letting them see it once; letting them see it a hundred times is not as good as letting them do it once. Through experimental activities, students have learned many agricultural production skills. Last year, the 142 members of the plant group generally learned the techniques of plowing, soaking seeds, mixing seeds, fertilizing, cutting branches, layering, sexual and asexual hybridization. Among the 35 first-year students who participated in the plant group last year, 22 students scored above 90 in the plant class, and the rest scored above 80.

      Learning from Labor Models and Local Farmers

    The students of this school have contact with agricultural cooperatives and famous labor models. The plant group signed a "contract" with the labor models and invited them to be teachers. Like Zhang Xincai, the provincial cotton high-yield model, Qin Fuxiu, the sweet potato high-yield model, Cheng Baifu, the wheat high-yield model, and Shi Yudian, the famous national agricultural labor model, are all the students' most admired and familiar friends. They often come to the county for meetings and always come to the school to take a look. Sometimes they are specially invited to the school to have discussions with the students, introduce production knowledge and experience, and personally come to the school garden to teach production techniques. Students also sometimes collectively visit the agricultural cooperative's production activities. These vivid and concrete activities help students learn practical production knowledge and techniques. When the school carried out fruit tree grafting last year, they invited Comrade Shi Yudian, an agricultural labor model, to guide them, so that the survival rate of fruit tree grafting reached more than 95%. Strengthening the connection with labor models not only helps students master production knowledge and skills, but also has a great influence on students due to the excellent qualities of labor models.

    The school often organizes students to visit agricultural cooperatives and silkworm farms. Each visit is of great educational significance to the students.

        Guiding Students to Apply Knowledge to Practice

    The school has contact with many agricultural cooperatives in the vicinity and often allows students to spread the new knowledge learned from labor models or from books and the new achievements achieved in the experimental garden to the masses. This mountainous area is suitable for sericulture, but there are few mulberry trees, and the masses only know how to plant mulberry seeds. It takes several years for mulberry trees to be harvested. The school tried the method of inserting mulberry branches, which allowed for harvesting mulberry leaves several years earlier than planting mulberry seeds. Last year, according to the experimental results, the school guided and helped Nanyu Cooperative insert more than 20,000 mulberry branches. The county attached great importance to this experience and has notified and promoted their practice.

    The animal group also taught many new technologies to the masses. Last year, Wang Laifu and Li Shuanlong told Nanyu Agricultural Cooperative about the school's high-temperature rapid sericulture experience and helped the cooperative raise 25 sheets of silkworm eggs. Every Sunday, they would go to take care of them. When the silkworms were about to spin cocoons, they found that some were infected with yellow muscardine. They returned to school to prepare some medicinal powder to help cure the silkworm disease. Last year, the cooperative's sericulture results were very good. The cocoons were spun in 27 or 28 days, and a total of more than 700 jin of cocoons were harvested, which were sold for more than 400 yuan in cash, increasing the income of the cooperative and solving difficulties. The masses were very grateful and called these students "little experts."

    The school students' teaching new agricultural technology knowledge to the masses is a mass activity. Last year, they counted that among the six classes of the third grade, 57 students helped the cooperative with corn emasculation and pollination, 10 students did sweet potato warm water soaking and hotbed seedling raising, 20 students grafted trees, 4 students made granular fertilizer, and 1 student raised silkworms. These activities have a great impact on the masses. Some cooperative members said: "In the past, schools were official schools, and what came out were blood-sucking scholars and candidates. Today, what comes out of the schools are labor experts who serve us."

      Encouraging Students to Study While Working

    In addition to helping students master production skills, the school also pays attention to cultivating students' habits of physical labor and encouraging students to study while working. Before 1955, some students participated in agricultural labor on holidays, but it was not common. Later, the rural areas were collectivized, and those who participated in labor were paid according to their work. The school encouraged students to participate in agricultural labor and provided students with many conveniences. As a result, student participation in agricultural labor has become a fashion. From last summer vacation to before this year's wheat vacation, 324 students in the third grade did more than 10,000 workdays, an average of 31 workdays per person. During this year's two-week wheat vacation, 1,024 students from the whole school participated in agricultural labor, doing a total of 7,167 workdays. These students not only generally participate in labor in the community during vacations, but also many people participate in labor in the community after school.

    The biggest benefit of mobilizing students to participate in agricultural labor is that this kind of labor is universal and regular, which can best cultivate students' labor habits, best help students master practical production knowledge and skills; at the same time, it can also effectively solve students' tuition difficulties and save expenses for the country. Among the 479 day students in the whole school, every student has labor income, only 2% of the students apply for student aid, and the amount applied for is also very small.

    The school is very concerned about the students' labor situation in the community, and the cooperative also often takes the initiative to introduce this situation to the school. After this year's wheat vacation, the school received more than 200 letters from the cooperative praising the students, and at the same time, the letters also criticized individual students who were not active in labor. The school announced all these letters to the students, so that the students were educated and encouraged.

    In addition to mobilizing students to participate in agricultural production, the school also organizes these students to engage in various paid labor activities during holidays and after school according to the requirements of some students who have relatively difficult lives. Last year, they organized students to dig canals, carry sand, do odd jobs, wash clothes, and build vegetable cellars, earning a total of nearly 300 yuan in wages. In the first semester of this year, they used the vacant land on campus to organize students to plant more than five mu of green vegetables and more than 6,000 broomcorns, which are estimated to earn more than 1,000 yuan. The school plans to distribute 80% of the income to the students, excluding tool depreciation and seed costs. This kind of paid labor organized according to the needs of the students not only cultivates the students' labor habits and thrifty style, but also solves the students' practical difficulties, so it is most welcomed by the students.

      Educating Students to Love Labor and Love the Countryside

    The school often uses many vivid activities to educate students to love labor and love the countryside. This school has a good tradition of running schools diligently and thriftily. Every year on the school anniversary, the school systematically conducts an education for students to love the school and inherit the good traditions. Last year was the tenth anniversary of the school's founding. The school held a large commemorative activity, introducing to the students the moving deeds of the students studying while working and fighting in difficult environments when the school was first established.

    Some students look down on agriculture, so the school introduces the life stories of some biologists, agronomists, and famous agricultural labor models to help students establish lofty ideals of engaging in agricultural labor. Some students think that the mountainous areas are poor and have no future, so the school organizes students to study the "National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft)" and listen to the county's planning report on developing mountainous areas. When they learned that the mountainous areas of Linxian in the future will become "everywhere are mulberry forests, vegetable fields, cotton mountains, flower and fruit gardens, rice and grain plains, herds of mules and horses, and pigs and sheep full of circles," many people's eyes lit up, greatly increasing their confidence in building a new socialist countryside.

    In addition to the above points, the school also often cultivates students' habit of loving labor through students' daily life and other activities, such as being on duty for cleaning, making teaching aids, and carrying out the Young Pioneers' small five-year plan activities. These activities have a great educational effect on students.

　　一所培养劳动能手的山区中学
　　——记林县一中的劳动教育
　　孙景超
    河南省林县一中，几年来，深入领会党的教育政策，坚持老解放区勤俭办学的传统精神，改进了教学工作，加强了劳动教育，使他们在教学、教育各方面，都取得了很大的成绩。
    林县在太行山区，是个老解放区。林县一中的前身是林县师范，建立在1946年秋天，是这个山区里开天辟地的第一所中等学校。
    学校刚建立时规模很小，只有一个班，三十个学生。那时正值解放战争开始，一切物资供应都很困难，学校只有几间没收地主的旧房子，其余许多设备，像垒锅灶、泥黑板、编睡觉铺的席子、锯木板打桌凳等都是学生自己动手来做。当时由于上面拨下来的经费很少，学校的一些经费，也要靠组织学生生产，像开荒地种菜、种粮食，赶大车贩煤，替人家弹棉花等来补助。所以学校一开始就树立了一种勤俭办学和崇尚劳动的优良风气。
    1953年，林县师范改为普通中学，由于党很重视这个老区学校，拨款扩建，学校发展很快，现在是一个千多人的学校了。自学校改为普通中学以来，学校行政领导对贯彻劳动教育一直很重视，经过四年来的艰苦摸索过程，工作中积累了不少宝贵的经验。
          生动的生物课
    学校的生物课重要的特点是能结合当地农村的特点进行教学。生物课教师平时很重视和当地劳动模范、老农、技术指导站、农场、蚕场以及县里生产领导机关取得联系，向他们了解当地生产情况，学习实际生产知识。在讲课时，注意引用当地的事例来说明书本上的知识。讲深耕可以增产，教师除了讲清一般道理以外，还介绍了本县因深耕而获丰产的陈玉林合作社的实例：1951年深耕七寸，每亩产三百六十斤；1952年深耕八寸，每亩产四百八十斤；1953年深耕十寸，每亩产六百斤。同时说明深耕必须合适，慢慢增加深度，一次耕得太深，不仅不能增产，反而要减产，接着教师又举了下申街社因片面接受深耕技术，把土翻到一尺五寸深，结果产量反而不如耕三、四寸深的教训。课本上谷子的播种时间是立夏到芒种，他们改为谷雨到立夏；谷子的行距是三十五—六十厘米，他们改为二十—三十厘米。还有施肥、选种、养蚕等，他们都结合当地特点，教学生在实际操作中学习和掌握科学知识。
    在讲课时，教师不仅注意用当地生产事例来说明书本上的知识，而且注意结合实际来阐明党的重要政策。在讲复种和轮作一课时，教师先一般介绍了适当的复种和轮作可以增产的道理，再讲我国目前还不能大量垦荒，第一个五年计划和第二个五年计划中都指出，农业增产的主要道路是靠适当增加复种面积，提高单位面积产量。同时又介绍了在当地实行合理轮作的实际意义。目前林县约有40％的耕地面积仍旧用旧的耕作制度，两年只能收小麦、甘薯或棉花、春谷三季作物。如果实行新的耕作制度，就可一年两熟，大大提高产量。为了证明这个结论的正确性，教师又进一步介绍了本县黄花乡口头村农业社，一亩地实行新的耕作制度，在同样自然条件下，比实行旧耕作制度增产了四百一十二斤粮食的事例。学生们听了很感兴趣。
    另外，教师还注意结合农村学生一般具有一定农业知识的实际，因此有的地方着重讲，有的地方就讲得简单些。讲小麦时，教师预先了解学生对小麦播种、管理具有一定技术和经验，但对选种、处理种子和生长过程，以及春季耙麦田的知识都很缺乏，教师就把这些问题讲得透彻些。
          多种多样的试验活动
    学校教师还通过试验活动，使学生在实地操作中掌握农业生产技术，养成从事农业生产的兴趣，为从事农业生产打下基础。
    养蚕是山区的一个重要副业。动物小组在老师指导下，试验了高温快速养蚕，由于温度、湿度、饲料和换气等掌握得适当，成绩很好。他们试验了七分之一张蚕种，养蚕时间由四十三天缩短到二十三天，每张蚕种能收获七十斤茧，创造了很高的纪录。“生物学通报”去年介绍了他们的高温快速养蚕法。他们饲养的来杭鸡在摄氏零下十五度还下蛋，一年产二百八十个鸡蛋，比书上介绍的标准还多三十个。他们还饲养了好几种兔子。
    试验园地分十一个区。在试验园地里试验的东西很多，有七十多种植物。试验的内容都是根据教学大纲结合当地情况和学生知识水平来确定的。当地主要农作物是小麦、红薯、玉米和棉花等，植物小组就对这几种作物进行试验。他们试验过红薯温汤浸种、高温育苗、搭架、月光花嫁接；他们对小麦进行过苏打浸种、温汤浸种和不浸种的对比试验，混合肥料和根外施肥的对比试验。用小苏打浸种的麦子和播种时增施磷肥的麦子，都增产20％多；月光花嫁接的红薯去年有一个重达十二斤，震动了林县。在县农业展览会里是最吸引人注意的一件展品。
    实验园地的一切试验活动，从耕地、选种、中耕、施肥到收获，全是在生物教师的直接指导下通过学科小组来进行的。整地、中耕和日常管理工作，是以小组组员为骨干发动全体同学来做的。教师都有这样的体会：给学生讲一百遍，不如让他们看一遍；让他们看一百遍，不如让他们做一遍。学生通过试验活动，学会了许多农业生产的技能。去年植物小组一百四十二人，一般都学会了耕地、浸种、拌种、施肥、插枝、压条、有性和无性杂交等技术，去年一年级参加植物小组的三十五人中有二十二人植物课成绩在九十分以上，其余也在八十分以上。
      向劳动模范和当地农民学习
    这个学校的学生同农业社和著名的劳动模范都有联系。植物小组和劳动模范订了“合同”，请他们当老师。像本县的全省棉花丰产模范张新才、红薯丰产模范秦福修、小麦丰产模范成百伏以及全国著名农业劳动模范石玉殿等，都是学生们最敬仰、最熟悉的朋友。他们经常到县里来开会，都要到学校里来看看，有时特地被请到学校来和学生座谈，介绍生产知识和经验，并亲自到学校园地上传授生产技术。学生有时也集体去参观农业社的生产活动。这些生动具体的活动，对学生学习实际的生产知识和技术都有帮助。学校在去年进行果树嫁接时，曾邀请农业劳动模范石玉殿同志来指导，使果树嫁接的成活率达到95％以上。加强和劳动模范的联系，不仅帮助学生掌握生产知识和技能，而且劳动模范的优秀品质，对学生的影响也很大。
    学校经常组织学生参观农业社和养蚕厂。每次参观对学生的教育意义很大。
        引导学生把知识用于实践
    学校和附近的许多农业社都有联系，经常让学生从劳动模范或从书本中学到的新知识和在试验园地上达到的新成果向群众传播。这个山区适于养蚕，但桑树少，群众只会种桑籽，桑树要好几年才能采桑。学校试用插桑条的办法，就比种桑籽提前几年采桑。去年学校根据试验成果，指导和帮助南峪社插了两万多枝桑条。县里很重视这个经验，已把他们的作法通报推广。
    动物小组也向群众传授了许多新技术。王来福、李栓龙去年把学校高温快速养蚕的经验告诉南峪农业社，并帮助这个社养了二十五张蚕种，每逢星期天，就去照料一番。蚕快结茧时，发现有的生了黄僵病，回校配了些药粉帮助把蚕病治好了。去年该社养蚕成绩很好，二十七、八天就结了茧，共收茧七百余斤，卖得现金四百多元，给社增加了收入，解决了困难，群众都很感激，称这几个学生是“小专家”。
    这个学校学生向群众传授新的农业技术知识是一项群众性的活动。去年他们统计三年级六个班中，帮助社做玉米去雄受粉的五十七人，做红薯温汤浸种和温床育苗的十人，嫁接树木的二十人，制颗粒肥料的四人，养蚕的一人。这些活动，在群众中影响很大，有的社员说：“过去学校是官府学堂，出来的是吸人血的秀才举人，今天学校出来的是为咱们服务的劳动能手。”
      鼓励学生一面劳动、一面读书
    学校除帮助学生掌握生产技能外，还注意培养学生有体力劳动的习惯，鼓励学生一面劳动，一面读书。1955年以前，有些学生在假日参加农业劳动，但不普遍。后来农村合作化了，参加劳动的都按劳分红，学校又鼓励学生参加农业劳动，并给学生许多方便；因而学生参加农业劳动已形成一种风尚。去年暑假到今年麦假前为止，三年级三百二十四个学生，共做了一万多个劳动日，平均每人做了三十一个劳动日，今年两个星期的麦假，全校有一千零二十四人参加了农业劳动，共做了七千一百六十七个劳动日。这些学生不仅在假期里普遍参加社里劳动，而且有许多人在课余都参加社里劳动。
    动员学生参加农业劳动的最大好处，就是这种劳动普遍、经常，最能培养学生的劳动习惯，最能帮助学生掌握实际的生产知识和技能；同时还能有效的解决学生的学费困难，并为国家节省开支。全校四百七十九个走读生中，每个学生都有劳动收入，只有2％的学生申请助学金，而且申请的数目还很少。
    学校很关心学生在社里劳动的情况，合作社也经常把这方面的情况主动向学校介绍。今年麦假后，学校收到合作社寄来的二百多封表扬学生的信，同时来信也批评了个别不积极劳动的学生。学校把这些信全部公布给学生看，使学生受到教育和鼓舞。
    学校除了动员学生参加农业生产外，还根据部分生活比较困难的同学的要求，组织这些同学利用假日和课余从事各种有报酬的劳动。去年他们组织学生挑渠、抬沙、做小工、洗衣服和打菜窖等，共得工资近三百元。今年上学期他们利用校内空地，组织学生种了五亩多青菜和六千多棵扫帚，估计可收入千余元。学校准备除去工具折旧和种子费用外，把80％的收入分给学生。今年暑假他们又组织了部分贫苦学生在学校里养蓖麻蚕。这种根据同学需要组织的有报酬的劳动，不仅培养了学生的劳动习惯和俭朴风气，同时又解决了学生的实际困难，所以最为同学欢迎。
      教育学生热爱劳动、热爱农村
    学校经常通过许多生动的活动来教育学生热爱劳动、热爱农村。这个学校有勤俭办学的优良传统，每年校庆，学校都要系统的向学生进行一次热爱学校，继承好传统的教育。去年是建校十周年，学校举行了很大的纪念活动，向学生介绍了学校初建时学生一面劳动、战斗，一面读书，在艰苦环境下坚持学习的动人事迹。
    有些学生看不起农业，学校就向学生介绍些生物学家、农学家、著名农业劳动模范的生平事迹，帮助学生树立从事农业劳动的远大理想。有些学生认为山区穷，没前途，学校就组织学生学习“全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）”，旁听县里关于发展山区的规划报告。当他们知道未来的林县山区将变为“到处是桑树林、蔬菜田、棉花山、花果园、米粮川，骡马成群，猪羊满圈”时，许多人眼睛亮了，大大增加了建设社会主义新农村的信心。
    除了上述几点，学校还经常通过学生的日常生活和其他活动，像值日扫除，制造教具，开展少先队小五年计划活动等，来培养学生热爱劳动的习惯，这些活动都对学生有很大的教育作用。
