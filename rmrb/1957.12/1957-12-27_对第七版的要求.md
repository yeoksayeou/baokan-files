    Requests for the Seventh Edition
    Currently, many factories, mines, enterprises, rural areas, government offices, and schools are展开 (unfolding) extensive ideological debates, and socialist thought education courses have been universally established in various universities and colleges. It is hoped that the seventh edition of the People's Daily can vividly reflect the tremendous gains our country has made on the ideological front, and promptly review and introduce the relevant situations and experiences. Recently, intellectuals are hotly debating issues such as whether sending intellectuals to lower levels is a waste of talent, whether participating in manual labor is the only way to transform one's ideology, and how to relate "redness" (political consciousness) and expertise, among other questions. It is hoped that the newspaper can combine these practical issues and elaborate on them theoretically.

    对第七版的要求
    现在，许多厂矿企业、农村、机关、学校都在展开思想大辩论，各高等学校并普遍设立了社会主义思想教育课程。希望人民日报的第七版能够鲜明地反映出我们国家在思想战线上的巨大收获，及时评述和介绍这方面的情况和经验。最近，知识分子中正在热烈地辩论着：知识分子下放是否大材小用、参加体力劳动是否是思想改造的唯一途径、红与专的关系怎样，等等问题。希望报纸结合这些实际问题，从理论上加以阐述。
