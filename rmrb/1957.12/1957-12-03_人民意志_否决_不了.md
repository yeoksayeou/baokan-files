　　The Will of the People Cannot Be "Vetoed"
    By Our Staff Commentator
    At the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly on November 29, due to the manipulation of Western colonial countries, the joint proposal put forward by eighteen Asian-African countries and Bolivia, requesting the Netherlands and Indonesia to hold new negotiations on the West Irian issue, was unreasonably vetoed. This shows that the United Nations General Assembly has once again abandoned its due responsibility on the West Irian issue and condoned the aggressive behavior of the Dutch colonialists.
    West Irian is Indonesian territory, and due to the illegal occupation by the Netherlands, this issue has long become an unresolved international dispute. It should have been resolved reasonably through negotiations long ago. However, the Dutch colonialists have always refused to do so. At the same time, they have taken various measures to try to permanently occupy this territory of Indonesia. Indonesian Ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. Soedjatmoko, has pointed out that recently, in addition to increasing their naval forces in and around the waters of West Irian, the Dutch colonialists are also preparing to take other military actions. Therefore, the attitude taken by the United Nations General Assembly on the West Irian issue will only fuel the arrogance of the Dutch colonialists and is not conducive to the peaceful resolution of the West Irian issue.
    However, although Western colonial countries can veto proposals on the West Irian issue in the UN, they cannot "veto" the unwavering will of the Indonesian people to recover West Irian.
    On November 30, Prime Minister Djuanda delivered a radio address, calling on the people of the whole country to maintain a strong fighting spirit and take "another path" outside the United Nations General Assembly to fight for the liberation of West Irian. This patriotic movement of the Indonesian people is continuing to develop. We believe that in the end, what will be "vetoed" will not be Indonesia's sacred national rights to West Irian, but all the remaining colonialist forces entrenched in this territory of Indonesia!

　　人民意志“否决”不了
    本报评论员
    在11月29日的联合国大会全体会议上，由于西方殖民国家的操纵，十八个亚非国家和玻利维亚联合提出的要求荷兰和印度尼西亚就西伊里安问题重新举行谈判的提案，竟遭到无理的否决。这说明联合国大会在西伊里安问题上又一次放弃了自己应尽的责任，放纵了荷兰殖民者的侵略行为。
    西伊里安是印度尼西亚的领土，由于荷兰的非法占领，这个问题长期以来就成为一个悬而未决的国际争端。它本来早就应该通过谈判求得合理解决。但是荷兰殖民者却一直拒绝这样做。同时，它采取了种种措施，想要长期霸占印度尼西亚的这块领土。印度尼西亚驻联合国代表沙斯特罗阿米佐约已经指出，最近荷兰殖民者除了增加他们在西伊里安海面及其周围的海军力量以外，还正准备采取其他军事行动。因此，这次联合国大会对西伊里安问题所采取的态度，只会助长荷兰殖民者的气焰，而不利于西伊里安问题的和平解决。
    但是，西方殖民国家尽管可以在联大否决关于西伊里安问题的提案，却无法“否决”印度尼西亚人民要求收复西伊里安的坚毅不拔的意志。
    11月30日，朱安达总理发表广播演说，号召全国人民要保持旺盛的战斗精神，采取联合国大会以外的“另一途径”为解放西伊里安而斗争。印度尼西亚全国人民的这个爱国运动正在继续发展中。我们相信，最后被“否决”的将不是印度尼西亚对西伊里安的神圣的民族权利，而是盘踞在印度尼西亚这块领土上的一切残存的殖民主义势力！
