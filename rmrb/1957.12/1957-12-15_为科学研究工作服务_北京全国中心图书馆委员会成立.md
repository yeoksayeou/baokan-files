Serving Scientific Research Work

Establishment of the Beijing National Central Library Committee

　　(Our Newspaper) The Beijing National Central Library Committee was established on the 14th. This committee is composed of the heads of the Beijing Library and the libraries of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Agricultural University, the Ministry of Geology, Renmin University of China, Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Beijing Normal University, as well as representatives from the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Higher Education, and some library experts. The committee members present discussed and approved two draft documents: "Brief Organizational Rules of the Beijing National Central Library Committee" and "Preliminary Plan for Coordination Work of the Beijing National Central Library."

　　The Beijing National Central Library is composed of several of the most well-established libraries in the Beijing area, and it is the first center of the national central libraries. According to the national book coordination plan formulated by the State Council's Science Planning Commission, the Beijing National Central Library has decided to immediately carry out the following tasks:

　　(1) Division of labor in book acquisition. According to the principle of thrift and in accordance with the characteristics and service targets of the central libraries in the Beijing area, the scope of book acquisition will be determined. For example, it is stipulated that the Beijing Library will focus on the acquisition of books and periodicals in the humanities, with special attention to rare Chinese books and books and periodicals published in Asian countries; the Chinese Academy of Sciences Library will focus on books and periodicals in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, basic theories in technical sciences, and emerging disciplines.

　　In the future, the needs of the central libraries will be given priority in importing foreign books and periodicals. When ordering foreign books and periodicals, the Beijing National Central Library should carefully review the order lists based on the principle of thrift; each central library should also consult with similar libraries to jointly discuss the order lists, so as to avoid duplication while ensuring variety; the replacement of expired foreign periodicals should be limited to one copy of each in the Beijing area.

　　(2) Establishment of a union catalog and card catalog center. The union catalogs that have been determined to be completed in 1958 are: Union Catalog of Chinese Revolutionary History, Union Catalog of Chinese Medicine, Union Catalog of Chinese Politics and Law, Union Catalog of Aquatic and Marine Products, Union Catalog of Ancient Chinese Agricultural Books, and Union Catalog of National Local Chronicles. Regarding the establishment of a national card catalog center, it has been determined that the Beijing Library will carry out this work starting next year.

　　(3) Book allocation work. A book allocation team will be established in the first quarter of next year, and will maintain close contact with the Book Allocation Committee of the Ministry of Higher Education when carrying out its work. Since the books accumulated in various libraries have not yet been fully sorted out, the current allocation work will be carried out in phases, with sorting and allocation proceeding simultaneously. The principle of allocation is a combination of system and region, giving priority to the needs of central libraries, remote areas, and newly established libraries.

　　(4) Opening to scientific workers. The Beijing Library has already established a research room specifically for scientific workers to carry out research work, but there are still many problems with this work, such as the issue of scientific workers borrowing books, copying, and duplication, which need to be gradually improved. The Beijing National Central Library will strive to take some concrete measures in the first quarter of next year to strengthen the work of opening up to scientific workers.

　　In addition, the Beijing National Central Library Committee will also propose implementation plans for international exchange, photographic reproduction, interlibrary loan, and cadre training in the first quarter of next year.

　　为科学研究工作服务
    北京全国中心图书馆委员会成立
    本报讯　北京全国中心图书馆委员会在14日成立。这个委员会由北京图书馆和中国科学院、医学科学院、农业科学院和农业大学、地质部、中国人民大学、北京大学、清华大学、北京师范大学等图书馆的负责人，以及文化部、高等教育部的代表和一些图书馆专家组成。到会委员讨论通过了“北京全国中心图书馆委员会组织简则”和“北京全国中心图书馆协调工作初步方案”两个草案。
    北京全国中心图书馆是由北京地区的若干最有基础的图书馆组成的，它是全国性中心图书馆的第一中心。根据国务院科学规划委员会制订的全国图书协调方案的规定，北京全国中心图书馆决定将立即进行下面一些工作：
    （1）图书采购工作的分工。根据节约的原则并按照北京区各中心图书馆的特点和服务对象，确定图书采购范围。例如，规定北京图书馆以采购人文科学书刊为重点，其中特别注意中文善本和亚洲各国出版的书刊的采购；中国科学院图书馆以数学、物理、化学、生物学、技术科学中的基础理论和新兴学科的书刊为重点。
    今后进口外文书刊将优先满足中心图书馆的需要。北京全国中心图书馆在订购外文书刊时，要本着节约的原则，认真地审查订购书单；各中心图书馆也要联系同类型的图书馆共同协商书单，既要做到避免重复，又要保证品种；补订外文过期期刊，在北京区每种以一份为限。
    （2）建立联合书目和卡片目录中心。已经确定在1958年内完成的联合书目是：中国革命史联合目录、中国医药联合目录、中国政法联合目录、水产海洋联合目录、中国古农书联合目录、全国方志联合目录等。关于建立全国卡片目录中心，确定由北京图书馆在明年起进行这项工作。
    （3）图书调配工作。明年第一季度成立图书调配小组，进行工作的时候同高等教育部图书调配委员会取得密切联系。由于各图书馆积存的图书还没有全部整理完毕，因此，目前调配工作采取分期进行、边整理边调配的办法。调配的原则是系统和地区相结合，尽先照顾中心图书馆、边远地区和新建立的图书馆的需要。
    （4）向科学工作者开放。目前北京图书馆已经成立研究室，专门供给科学工作者进行研究工作，但这项工作还存在不少问题，如科学工作者的图书外借问题、抄写、复制等工作都要逐步加以改善。北京全国中心图书馆将争取在明年第一季度内为加强向科学工作者开放的工作，采取一些具体措施。
    此外，北京全国中心图书馆委员会对国际交换、照相复制、馆际互借和干部培养等工作，也将在明年第一季度提出实施方案。
