Xinhua News Agency, Rome: According to TASS, Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti delivered a speech on December 16th in Licata, at a mass rally celebrating the closing of the Fifth Party Congress of the Province of Sardinia. In his speech, he analyzed the current international situation. Togliatti spoke of the tension caused by the new, insane aggressive plans of the American imperialists.

Togliatti said that the difference between the policies of the countries of the socialist camp and the policies of the imperialists has never been as clear as it is today. The document signed not long ago in Moscow by representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties is a new proposal to strive for peace and to reach agreements. However, the imperialists are responding to this proposal with a new aggressive offensive. The Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Alliance Council opened under the sign of further deepening the opposition between the two camps. The United States is not responding to the superiority of the socialist system, which has been clearly demonstrated by recent events, with peaceful competition, but with piecing together new and more dangerous military forces equipped with even more destructive weapons.

Togliatti said that the establishment of American rocket weapons bases risks turning Italy into a battlefield. In this situation, we Italian communists demand that our country pursue a policy of atomic neutrality to avoid the danger of destruction. A movement should be launched in our country to establish a security zone in Europe based on international guarantees, which will guarantee the independence and survival of our country. Togliatti said he advocated holding a referendum on this issue.

    陶里亚蒂抨击美国新侵略计划
    主张意大利执行中立政策
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂16日在利卡利阿利为庆祝撒丁省第五次党代表会议闭幕的群众大会上发表了演说。他在讲话中分析了当前的国际形势。陶里亚蒂谈到美国帝国主义者的新的疯狂的侵略计划所造成的紧张局势。
    陶里亚蒂说，社会主义阵营国家的政策和帝国主义者的政策的不同，从来没有像今天这样明显。共产党和工人党的代表不久以前在莫斯科签署的文件，是争取和平和争取达成协议的一个新建议。但是，帝国主义者却用新的侵略攻势来回答这个建议。北大西洋联盟理事会巴黎会议，在进一步加深两大阵营之间的对立的标志下开幕了。美国对最近的事件所明显表现出来的社会主义制度的优越性，不是用和平竞赛来回答，而是用拼凑以破坏性更大的武器装备起来的新的更为危险的军事力量来回答。
    陶里亚蒂说，美国火箭武器基地的建立，有使意大利变为战场的危险，在这种情况下，我们意大利共产党员要求我们的国家执行原子中立政策以避免遭受毁灭的危险。在我国应当展开一个争取在欧洲建立以国际保证为基础的安全地区的运动，这个安全地区将能保障我们国家的独立和生存。陶里亚蒂说，他主张就这个问题举行全民投票。
