We are the Promotion Faction
Chen Zhiyan

In 1958, more than 500,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery will be sent to the countryside. A careful reading of yesterday's front-page headline and the third-page editorial of this newspaper reveals that this is a major event in the history of farmland irrigation in our country. This event vividly demonstrates a kind of socialist drive, an attitude of actively promoting the development of things, rather than a passive and conservative attitude.

We Communists have always been the promotion faction for all advancing causes. We always want to do things faster and better, and do not advocate doing things slower and worse.

This idea seems easy for everyone to understand. But not necessarily. Not long ago, a wind appeared, as if doing things slower and worse was considered steady and correct. And doing things faster and better was suspected of being rash. Didn't you see that the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical was once swept away by this wind? And "Better to make a conservative mistake than a rash one" seemed to become foresight. Comrades who hold this view, in terms of ideological method, do not see the mainstream of things, that is, they do not see or ignore the basic achievements of our cause, and make a fuss about some minor deviations. From the perspective of revolutionary spirit, these comrades lack a drive, a spirit of promotion that is not afraid of difficulties. When difficulties arrive, they want to "demote."

This kind of socialist drive, this kind of revolutionary spirit of promotion is very important. Without it, it would be impossible to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in fifteen years.

We are the promotion faction, but we are not subjectivists, and blind rashness that does not conform to reality is by no means our aim. We have learned from the experience of the double-wheeled double-shared plow. Therefore, in the discussion of sending 500,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery to the countryside this time, we have made practical studies and regulations on the quality, use, repair, and price of the machinery. In this way, it is possible to fully implement the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, and truly promote the development of water conservancy.

However, the problem is still to first have this active spirit of promotion.

    我们是促进派　
    陈之衍
    1958年将有五十万马力以上的排灌机械下乡。仔细读一下昨天本报第一版的头条新闻和第三版的社论就可以看出：这是我国农田灌溉史上的一件大事。这件事鲜明地表现出一种社会主义的干劲，一种对于事物发展积极地促进的态度，而不是消极、保守的态度。
    我们共产党人对于一切前进的事业历来就是促进派。我们总是想把事情办得快一点、好一点，而不主张办得慢一点、差一点。
    这个思想似乎人人都容易明白。可是也不见得。就在不久以前，出现过一股风，好像把事情办得慢一点、差一点才是稳健、正确。而把事情办得快一点、好一点就有冒进之嫌。你不见多、快、好、省的方针一度被这股风刮掉了？而“宁可犯保守的错误，也不要犯冒进的错误”也似乎成了先见之明。持这种想法的同志，从思想方法上说是看不见事情的主流，即看不到或者忽视了我们事业的基本的成就方面，发现一些次要的偏差就大惊小怪起来。从革命精神方面来看，这些同志缺乏一种干劲，一种不怕困难的促进精神。困难一到，就想“促退”。
    这种社会主义的干劲，这种革命的促进精神是很要紧的，没有它，要想在十五年后，在主要工业品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国是办不到的。
    我们是促进派，但我们不是主观派，不合乎实际的盲目冒进绝非我们的宗旨。我们有过双轮双铧犁的教训，因此这次在讨论五十万马力排灌机械下乡的时候，对于机械的质量、使用、修理、价格等等，都作了切实的研究和规定。这样就可能全面贯彻多、快、好、省的方针，真正起到促进水利事业发展的作用了。
    但是，问题还是首先要具有这种积极的促进精神。
