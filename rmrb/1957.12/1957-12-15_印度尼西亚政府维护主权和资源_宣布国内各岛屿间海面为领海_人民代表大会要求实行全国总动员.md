Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 14th - The Indonesian government announced that the waters surrounding Indonesian islands, between Indonesian islands, and connecting the islands, regardless of size, are naturally parts of Indonesian territory. These waters are entirely part of Indonesia's internal waters or territorial waters within its absolute sovereignty.

The Indonesian government discussed the issue of Indonesian territorial waters at a cabinet meeting held on the evening of the 13th and made the above decision. A communique issued after the meeting stated that this decision was made to maintain the integrity of Indonesian sovereignty and the country's abundant resources, and therefore all islands and the waters between them should be regarded as a whole.

The Indonesian government's decision on the issue of Indonesian territorial waters at this time is considered very important. This is because Indonesia's numerous islands are scattered over vast oceans. In the past, the territorial waters between the islands were defined as three nautical miles around each island, but the distance between many islands far exceeds this figure. Therefore, many foreign warships and ships can freely travel between the Indonesian islands. Since the Indonesian people launched the struggle against Dutch imperialism, Dutch and other Western warships and illegal vessels have become a greater threat to Indonesia's security and maritime traffic.

The Indonesian government also decided that the extent of Indonesian territorial waters with foreign countries should be determined as follows: connect the most prominent parts of Indonesian islands with straight lines, and measure twelve nautical miles outwards from this line; the area within this width is Indonesia's territorial waters.

The Indonesian government stated that foreign ships navigating in Indonesian internal waters will be protected as long as they do not undermine Indonesian sovereignty and security.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 14th - The National Committee of the All-Indonesia People's Congress issued a statement on the struggle to recover West Irian on the 13th, demanding that the government implement national mobilization to strengthen the forces of the struggle.

The statement pointed out that in view of all possible situations, the government should implement national mobilization. The statement also demanded that the government make it clear that negotiations with the Netherlands can only be conducted on the premise of returning West Irian to Indonesia.

The first meeting of the All-Indonesia People's Congress was convened in August 1955 on the proposal of President Sukarno. Participants included people from various parties and social organizations. The main agenda of the meeting was to fight for the recovery of West Irian. The National Committee is the standing body of this congress. (Attached picture)

    印度尼西亚政府维护主权和资源
    宣布国内各岛屿间海面为领海
    人民代表大会要求实行全国总动员
    新华社雅加达14日电　印度尼西亚政府宣布，围绕印度尼西亚各岛屿的、在印度尼西亚各岛屿之间和联接各岛屿的海面，不论面积大小如何，都是印度尼西亚领域的当然部分，这些海面一律是印度尼西亚绝对主权范围内的内海或领海的一部分。
    印度尼西亚政府在13日晚间举行的内阁会议上讨论了有关印度尼西亚领海的问题，并且作出了上述决定。会后发表的一项公报说，作出这个决定是为了保持印度尼西亚主权和本国的丰富资源的完整，因此所有岛屿和岛屿之间的海面应当看作是一个整体。
    印度尼西亚政府在目前这个时候就有关印度尼西亚的领海问题作出上述决定，被认为是很重要的。因为，印度尼西亚的为数很多的岛屿散布在广阔的海洋上，过去在各岛屿之间的领海范围规定为各岛屿周围三海里，但是在许多岛屿之间的距离远远超过这个数字。因此，许多外国军舰和轮船能够在印度尼西亚的岛屿之间任意穿行。自从印度尼西亚人民开展反对荷兰帝国主义的斗争以来，荷兰和其他西方国家的军舰和违法的船只就成为对印度尼西亚的安全和海上交通的更大的威胁。
    印度尼西亚政府还决定，印度尼西亚同外国之间的领海范围应当这样确定：把印度尼西亚各岛最突出的部分用直线联接，从这条直线向外量出十二海里，这宽度以内就是印度尼西亚的领海。
    印度尼西亚政府表示，在印度尼西亚内海上航行的外国轮船，只要它们不破坏印度尼西亚的主权和安全，就将受到保护。
    据新华社雅加达14日电　全印度尼西亚人民代表大会全国委员会13日就争取收复西伊里安的斗争发表声明，要求政府实行全国总动员以加强斗争的力量。
    声明指出，鉴于可能发生的一切情况，政府应该实行全国总动员。声明还要求政府明确表示，只有在把西伊里安归还印度尼西亚的前提下，才能够同荷兰进行谈判。
    全印度尼西亚人民代表大会的第一次会议是根据苏加诺总统的建议，在1955年8月召开的。参加大会的有各党派、各社会团体的人士。会议的主要议程就是为收复西伊里安而斗争。全国委员会是这个代表大会的常设机构。（附图片）
