Yunnan's grain production this year increased by 60% compared to last year. The total output has increased from 8.8 billion jin in 1952 to 12.5 billion jin, exceeding the target set by the First Five-Year Plan by 10.8%.

During the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, Yunnan experienced two years of bumper harvests and three years of moderate harvests. Grain production increased by an average of 7.1% annually. Forty-three counties achieved consecutive bumper harvests, and eleven counties and cities saw their total grain output more than double over the five years. Simao County, located on the border, saw its grain output increase by 286% in 1957 compared to 1952. The notoriously barren Lushui mountainous area also saw a 151% increase in total grain output compared to 1952.

In recent years, to ensure increased agricultural production, Party committees at all levels have closely focused on water conservancy construction, increased fertilizer application, and land reclamation as measures to increase production.

Yunnan Province has rivers running throughout its territory, providing superior water conservancy conditions. However, in the past, these conditions were not well utilized. At the beginning of liberation, Yunnan had only 4.43 million mu of paddy fields. In recent years, more than fifty water conservancy projects with an area of more than ten thousand mu have been built in the territory, and a total of more than 200,000 large and small projects have been completed. The irrigated area has been expanded by more than 6.23 million mu. While expanding irrigation, the irrigation area of more than 8 million mu has also been improved, the flood prevention and drainage area has been expanded by more than 5 million mu, and water and soil conservation measures have covered more than 1,100 square kilometers. To date, the province has more than 12 million mu of water-conserving paddy fields. Fertilizer accumulation has also been an important measure to increase production that has been consistently adhered to in recent years. Through practical education, farmers have changed their habits of not accumulating or applying fertilizer. In most areas, the phenomenon of "white seed land" and "white water seedlings" has been basically eliminated, and the amount of fertilizer applied is mostly more than 4,000 jin per mu. Significant progress has also been made in expanding cultivated land. To date, more than 3.6 million mu of wasteland has been reclaimed.

Currently, the average income per capita of the province's agricultural population has increased from 71 yuan in 1952 to 100 yuan. The average grain per capita has increased from the original 588 jin to more than 700 jin. (Attached picture)

### 云南粮食产量超过五年计划指标  发展水利增施肥料起了很大作用

　　云南粮食产量超过五年计划指标
    发展水利增施肥料起了很大作用
    本报讯　云南省今年粮食又比去年增产60％，总产量已由1952年的八十八亿斤，增长到一百二十五亿斤，超额完成了第一个五年计划规定的指标10.8％。
    云南在执行第一个五年计划期间，出现了两年大丰收和三年小丰收，粮食生产平均每年增长7.1％，其中连年获得丰收的有四十三个县，并有十一个县市五年中粮食总产量增长了一倍以上。地处边疆的思茅县的粮食产量1957年比1952年增长286％。向以贫瘠著名的泸水山区，粮食总产量也较1952年增长151％。
    几年来，为了确保农业增产，各级党委紧紧地抓住了兴修农田水利，增施肥料和开垦荒地的增产措施。
    云南省河流纵贯全境，有着优越的水利条件。但过去没有把它很好的利用起来。解放初期，云南境内只有四百四十三万亩水田。几年来，境内修筑了万亩以上的水利工程达五十多个，大小工程总计二十多万个。扩大了灌溉面积达六百二十三万多亩。在兴修增灌的同时，还改善灌溉面积八百多万亩，防洪排涝保收面积五百多万亩，水土保持一千一百多平方公里。到目前止，全省已有保水田一千二百多万亩。积肥也是几年来一直坚持的一项重要增产措施。经过实践的教育，农民改变了不积肥、不施肥的习惯，绝大部分地区基本上消灭了“白籽地”、“白水秧”的现象，施肥量每亩多在四千斤以上。扩大耕地面积，也取得了很大成绩，到目前止，已开垦了荒地三百六十多万亩。
    现在全省农业人口每人平均收入已由1952年的七十一元增加到一百元。每人平均粮食已由原来的五百八十八斤提高到七百多斤。（附图片）
