Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 28th: According to TASS, Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, wrote to the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, extending warm congratulations to the conference in the name of the World Peace Council. The letter stated, "We are confident that the Asian-African Solidarity Conference will be able to make a great contribution in seeking just and peaceful ways to solve current international problems, especially those related to the relations between peoples and nations."

Joliot-Curie pointed out that the role played on the international stage by those countries that have already or are in the process of shedding the shackles of colonialism is growing. "The historic Bandung Conference held in 1955 showed this."

Joliot-Curie emphasized that the People's Republic of China must be immediately admitted to the United Nations. He also condemned certain countries for trying to treat those countries that have only recently gained independence as inferior and often adopting a protector's attitude towards them without any basis.

Joliot-Curie pointed out that it is timely and very important to include the issue of the nuclear arms race on the agenda of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference. He called for all efforts to be made to eliminate the terrible threat facing the world and to strive for an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

Joliot-Curie also pointed out that the World Peace Council's initiation of a conference on disarmament and international cooperation in 1958 is of great significance to the cause of peace. He hoped that the people of all countries attending the Asian-African Solidarity Conference would support all efforts aimed at easing international tensions and preventing new war threats.
