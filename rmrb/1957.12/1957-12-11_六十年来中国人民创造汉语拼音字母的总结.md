　　A Summary of the Chinese People's Creation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Over the Past Sixty Years
　　Wu Yuzhang Li Jinxi
The draft of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme has been published. This is a major event in the cultural life of the Chinese people. The publication of this set of phonetic alphabets and its future promotion among the masses will have a profound impact in the vast fields of China's cultural and educational undertakings, and will be conducive to promoting the development of China's socialist construction.
    The Chinese people have a history of more than sixty years in creating phonetic alphabets for Chinese. From the Sino-Japanese War to the Xinhai Revolution, it was the period of the so-called "Qieyinzi Movement" in the history of Chinese character reform. At that time, patriotic people advocated character reform and created phonetic schemes. The most important of these include Lu Ganzhang's "Qieyin New Characters" (1892), Cai Xiyong's "Chuanyin Kuai Zi" (1896), Shen Xue's "Shengshi Yuanyin" (1896), Wang Bingyao's "Pinyin Zi Pu" (1896), Wang Zhao's "Mandarin Alphabet" (1900), Lao Naixuan's "Hesheng Jianzi" (1905), Zhu Wenxiong's "Jiangsu New Alphabet" (1906), and Liu Mengyang's "Chinese Phonetic Characters" (1908). The Qieyinzi of the late Qing Dynasty can be roughly divided into two schools in terms of the form of the letters: one school advocated using Latin letters, and the other advocated creating new characters; the latter can be further divided into small systems such as "shorthand system," "kana system," "seal script system," "cursive script system," and "symbol and number system." Among the Qieyinzi, Wang Zhao's and Lao Naixuan's schemes were disseminated in some areas at that time. After the Xinhai Revolution, the Reading Pronunciation Unification Conference in 1913 formulated the "Zhuyin Alphabet," which was officially announced by the Ministry of Education at that time in 1918. The emergence of the Zhuyin alphabet was a major advancement in Chinese character phonetic notation. It was widely promoted in primary and secondary schools (the current primary school Chinese textbooks also use it to annotate Chinese characters because the phonetic scheme has not yet been determined), and it has made great contributions to helping literacy and "unifying the national language." In 1926, the "National Language Romanization" was produced by Qian Xuantong, Li Jinxi, Zhao Yuanren, etc., and was officially announced by the University Council of Nanjing at that time in 1928. Subsequently, in 1931, the "Latinized New Script" was produced by Qu Qiubai, Wu Yuzhang, and others. The Latinized New Script and the National Language Romanization are two relatively complete Latin alphabet-based Chinese phonetic schemes created by the Chinese themselves, which greatly surpassed the various similar schemes before them, including the various dialect Romanizations formulated by Western missionaries, the widely popular Wade-Giles scheme, and the Postal Romanization system. If the disadvantage of the National Language Romanization is that the method of indicating tones is too complicated, then the disadvantage of the Latinized New Script is that it is too simple: it does not indicate tones at all. The Latinized New Script was promoted and tried out among overseas Chinese living in the Far Eastern border region of the Soviet Union, as well as in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines during the Anti-Japanese War.
    The draft of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme now promulgated by the State Council can be said to be a summary of the experience of predecessors over the past sixty years. The reason why we use Latin letters, instead of continuing to use Zhuyin alphabets, or creating a new set of characters, is because Latin letters are the most widely used letters internationally. Worldwide, the number of people who use Latin letters is more than 600 million. Therefore, the adoption of Latin letters in the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme is greatly conducive to cultural exchanges with people of all countries. In 1906, Zhu Wenxiong, the creator of the "Jiangsu New Alphabet," said: "It is better to adopt the letters that are commonly used in the world than to create new characters that the world has never seen before." This sentence is still correct today. As for comparing it with various historical Latin alphabet-based Chinese phonetic schemes (whether it is National Language Romanization or Latinized New Script), the current draft of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme is indeed a latercomer that surpasses its predecessors. This draft inherits the excellent traditions of previous schemes, while striving to avoid their shortcomings. The draft uses b, d, and g to represent the voiceless consonants "bo, de, ge," which is precisely accepting the common excellent tradition of National Language Romanization and Latinized New Script. The draft also inherits another significant advantage of the Latinized New Script, that is, the retroflex sounds zh, ch, sh (zhi, chi, shi) and the alveolar sounds z, c, s (zi, ci, si) are in pairs and the system is neat, and at the same time, their finals are also specified. In terms of tone marking methods, the draft avoids the shortcomings of the National Language Romanization's overly complicated regulations, and adopts the tone marking symbols of the Zhuyin alphabet. Overall, this draft is indeed more complete than any scheme in the past sixty years. For the several habitual spellings that are still popular in society today, this draft is also relatively close to them. Since the Chinese Character Reform Committee published the first draft of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme in February 1956, it has been widely discussed by people from all walks of life across the country, and has been repeatedly reviewed and revised by the State Council's Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Review Committee, and finally approved and promulgated by the State Council, and it was decided to submit it to the next meeting of the National People's Congress for discussion and approval. In the discussions over the past two years, people from all walks of life have put forward many valuable opinions and different requirements for the phonetic scheme from various perspectives. The Chinese Character Reform Committee and the Review Committee have made revisions to the original draft based on the opinions and requirements of all parties. However, it should be admitted that it is impossible to simultaneously meet all the different requirements of all parties in one scheme, so this draft cannot make everyone feel equally satisfied. However, the current draft does reflect the opinions of the majority of people who participated in the discussion, so we believe that this draft is relatively appropriate and feasible. We hope that the next meeting of the National People's Congress will approve it to meet the urgent needs of all parties in the country for a phonetic scheme.
    After this draft is approved by the National People's Congress, we believe that it should be gradually promoted and used in the following aspects.
    First, teach the phonetic alphabet in primary schools, middle schools, and normal schools. We hope that the first volume of primary school Chinese textbooks in the autumn of 1958 will use this set of phonetic alphabets to annotate new characters. It is estimated that by the autumn of 1958, primary school Chinese teachers in the first grade across the country will not have time to learn all the phonetic alphabets, so they can teach them with emphasis, and gradually popularize them in 1959. The first grade of middle schools and normal schools across the country can universally teach the phonetic alphabet starting in the autumn of 1958.
    Second, teach the phonetic alphabet in adult education in cities and rural areas in the Mandarin-speaking region to help eliminate illiteracy. We hope that the education department will intensify the training of key personnel from next year onwards so that cadres engaged in spare-time education and literacy work, teachers in urban spare-time schools, and literacy teachers can learn the phonetic alphabet, and conduct pilot projects in a few factories and agricultural production cooperatives with favorable conditions. Starting in 1959, pilot teaching will be carried out first in several cities and counties in the Mandarin-speaking region, and gradually achieve that all young and middle-aged people and primary and secondary school students across the country learn the phonetic alphabet.
    Third, promote the phonetic alphabet in publishing and translation. In terms of publishing, a large number of teaching materials, charts, and reference books of phonetic alphabets should be supplied, and work should begin on compiling publications with phonetic Chinese characters and Chinese character phonetic transcriptions for comparison. Chinese character dictionaries should use phonetic alphabets for phonetic notation and character retrieval. Popular reading materials and comic strips can gradually promote the use of phonetic alphabets to annotate Chinese characters. In order to facilitate phonetic notation, it is hoped that the publishing department will carve bronze molds of phonetic Chinese characters as soon as possible. The Latin alphabet transliteration of Chinese personal names and place names used in foreign language publications, foreign broadcasts by news agencies, foreign postal and telecommunications, and diplomatic documents is currently unreasonable because it continues to use the old spelling methods. It should be considered to change to the new phonetic scheme.
    Fourth, try out the phonetic alphabet in telegrams. The Northeast Railway Telegraph has been using Latin letters for many years. In the past, because the phonetic scheme had not yet been finalized, it was not promoted on national railways. We hope that the postal and telecommunications departments will study this issue, compile a phonetic Chinese character telegraph code as soon as possible, conduct pilot projects first, and gradually promote it after receiving results.
    Fifth, promote the phonetic alphabet in public places. The station signs of railways and highways, the road signs of urban streets, and the signs written in Chinese characters in stations, docks, hospitals, banks, post offices, and other public places can be annotated with phonetic alphabets. It is also advocated that the mastheads of newspapers and periodicals and the signs of organs and organizations should be gradually annotated with phonetic alphabets.
    Sixth, use the phonetic alphabet to help ethnic minorities and foreigners learn Chinese and Chinese characters. It is extremely convenient for ethnic minorities and foreigners to learn Chinese and Chinese characters through the phonetic alphabet. Chinese textbooks, dictionaries, and reading materials should be compiled using the phonetic alphabet for them to use.
    Seventh, the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme can be used as the basis for ethnic minorities to create writing systems. In the future, when ethnic minorities create or reform their own ethnic scripts, we believe that in principle, Latin letters should be adopted, and the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme should be used as a common basis. The pronunciation and usage of the letters should be as consistent as possible to facilitate mutual learning and communication.
    Eighth, language workers should conduct further research on the phonetic scheme. After the scheme is published, language workers still need to conduct further research and experiments on the phonetic scheme to make it more perfect in practice. For example, teaching procedures and methods, tone marking methods, word joining, transliteration of foreign words, phonetic notation of dialects, etc., all need to be further researched and experimented with this set of letters as a tool.
    We believe that these are the tasks that should be carried out first after the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme is determined.

　　六十年来中国人民创造汉语拼音字母的总结
　　吴玉章　黎锦熙
    汉语拼音方案草案公布了。这是中国人民文化生活中的一件大事。这一套拼音字母的公布和它今后在广大群众中的推行，将在我国文化教育事业的广大领域中产生深远的影响，并且有利于促进我国社会主义建设事业的发展。
    我国人民为汉语创造拼音字母，已有六十多年的历史。从甲午战争到辛亥革命，是中国文字改革运动史上的所谓“切音字运动”时期，当时的爱国人士纷纷提倡文字改革，创制拼音方案。其中最主要的有卢戆章的“切音新字”（1892年），蔡锡勇的“传音快字”（1896年），沈学的“盛世元音”（1896年），王炳耀的“拼音字谱”（1896年），王照的“官话字母”（1900年），劳乃宣的“合声简字”（1905年），朱文熊的“江苏新字母”
  （1906年），刘孟扬的“中国音标字”（1908年）。清末的切音字从字母的形式上可以大别为两个流派：一派主张采用拉丁字母，一派主张自造新字；后者又可分为“速记系”、“假名系”、“篆文系”、“草书系”、“象数系”等小系。切音字中，王照和劳乃宣的方案当时曾经在一部分地区得到传播。辛亥革命之后，1913年的读音统一会制定了“注音字母”，至1918年由当时的教育部正式公布。注音字母的产生是汉字标音法的一大进步，它曾经在小学、中学普遍推广（目前的小学语文课本，因拼音方案尚未确定，亦用它给汉字注音），对于帮助识字和“统一国语”有过很大的贡献。1926年产生了由钱玄同、黎锦熙、赵元任等制订的“国语罗马字”，至1928年由当时南京的大学院正式公布。接着，1931年产生了由瞿秋白、吴玉章等制订的“拉丁化新文字”。拉丁化新文字和国语罗马字是中国人自己创制的拉丁字母式汉语拼音方案中比较完善的两个方案，大大超越了它们之前的各种同类方案，包括西洋传教士制订的各种方言罗马字、流行很广的威妥玛式方案，邮政式方案在内。如果说国语罗马字的缺点是标示声调的办法过繁，那末拉丁化新文字的缺点就是过简：完全不标声调。拉丁化新文字曾经在居住苏联远东边疆的华侨中以及抗日战争时期的陕甘宁边区和敌后解放区中推行试用过。
    现在由国务院公布的这个汉语拼音方案草案可以说就是六十年来前人经验的总结。我们之所以采用拉丁字母，没有就沿用注音字母，也没有自创一套新字，是因为拉丁字母是目前国际间使用得最广泛的字母。在全世界范围内，用拉丁字母的人数在六万万以上，因此汉语拼音方案采用拉丁字母，就大大有利于与各国人民之间的文化交流。1906年，“江苏新字母”的创案人朱文熊就说过：“与其造世界未有之新字，不如采用世界所通行之字母。”这句话至今还是正确的。至于跟历史上各种拉丁字母式的汉语拼音方案（无论是国语罗马字或者拉丁化新文字）比较起来，现在这个汉语拼音方案草案确实是后来居上。这个草案继承了以前各种方案的优良传统，同时竭力避免了它们的缺点。草案以b，d，g表示清辅音“玻、得、哥”，正是接受了国语罗马字和拉丁化新文字共同的优良传统。草案也继承了拉丁化新文字的另一个显著优点，即舌尖后音zh，ch，sh（知、蚩、诗）和舌尖前音z，c，s（资、雌、思）两两相对，系统整齐，同时又规定了它们的韵母。在标调办法上，草案避免了国语罗马字的条例过繁的缺点，而接受了注音字母的标调符号。总起来说，这个草案确实比六十年来的任何一个方案都要更加完善。而对于现在社会上还在流行的几种习惯拼法来说，这个草案跟它们也都还比较接近。自从1956年2月中国文字改革委员会发表汉语拼音方案的第一个草案以来，曾经经过全国各方面人士的广泛讨论，复经国务院汉语拼音方案审订委员会的反复审议和多次修订，最后由国务院通过公布，并且决定提交全国人民代表大会下次会议讨论批准。在近两年来的讨论中，各方面人士从各个角度对拼音方案提出了许多宝贵的意见和不同的要求，中国文字改革委员会和审订委员会根据各方面的意见和要求对原草案作了修改。但是应该承认，要在一个方案里同时满足各方面的所有的不同要求是不可能的，因此这个草案也就不可能使每一个人都感到同样满意。但是目前这个草案确实反映了参加讨论的人们中的大多数人的意见，因此我们认为这个草案是比较妥善可行的。我们希望，全国人民代表大会的下次会议能够予以批准，以满足全国各方面对于拼音方案的迫切需要。
    这个草案经全国人民代表大会批准之后，我们认为应该在以下各个方面逐步推行和使用。
    第一，在小学、中学和师范学校教学拼音字母。我们希望，1958年秋季的小学语文课本第一册采用这套拼音字母来给生字注音。估计至1958年秋季，全国小学一年级的语文教师还来不及全部学会拼音字母，因此可以有重点地教学，到1959年再逐步普及。全国的中学和师范学校一年级，从1958年秋季起可以普遍教学拼音字母。
    第二，在城市和普通话区域农村成人教育中教学拼音字母，帮助扫盲识字。我们希望，教育部门从明年起即加紧训练骨干，使业余教育和扫盲工作的干部，城市业余学校教师和扫盲教师学会拼音字母，并在少数有条件的工厂和农业生产合作社进行试点。从1959年起首先在普通话区域的几个城市和几个县重点试教，逐步做到全国青壮年和中小学生都学会拼音字母。
    第三，在出版和翻译方面推行拼音字母。在出版方面应该大量供应拼音字母的各种教学用书、图表和参考用书，并且着手编印注音汉字和汉字拼音对照的出版物。汉字字典应该采用拼音字母注音和检字。通俗读物和连环图画可以逐步推行以拼音字母给汉字注音。为了便于注音，希望出版部门及早刻制注音汉字铜模。在外文出版物、通讯社对外广播，对外邮电和外交文件中所用关于中国人名地名的拉丁字母译音，现在因为沿用旧式拼法，很不合理，应该考虑改用新的拼音方案。
    第四，在电报上试用拼音字母。东北铁路电报采用拉丁字母已有多年，过去因为拼音方案尚未定案，所以没有在全国铁路上推广。我们希望邮电部门研究这个问题，及早编制拼音汉字电码，先行试点，待收到成效后逐步推行。
    第五、在公共场所推行拼音字母。铁路、公路的站牌，城市街道的路牌，车站、码头、医院、银行、邮局以及其他公共场所用汉字书写的牌子，可以加注拼音字母。报刊的报头和机关团体的牌子，也可以提倡逐步加注拼音。
    第六、用拼音字母帮助兄弟民族和外国人学习汉语汉字。兄弟民族和外国人通过拼音字母学习汉语和汉字，有极大的便利。应该用拼音字母编印汉语课本、字典和读物，供他们应用。
    第七、汉语拼音方案可以用作兄弟民族创造文字的基础。今后兄弟民族创制或改革自己的民族文字，我们认为原则上应该采用拉丁字母，并且以汉语拼音方案作为共同的基础，在字母的读音和用法上尽量一致，以便于互相学习和沟通。
    第八、语文工作者应该对拼音方案作进一步的研究。方案公布后，语文工作者还需要对拼音方案作进一步的研究和实验，使它在实践中更趋完善。例如教学程序和方法、标调方法、词的连写、外来语的译音、方言的注音等等，都需要用这套字母作为工具来进行进一步的研究和实验。
    我们以为，这些就是汉语拼音方案确定之后首先应该进行的工作。
