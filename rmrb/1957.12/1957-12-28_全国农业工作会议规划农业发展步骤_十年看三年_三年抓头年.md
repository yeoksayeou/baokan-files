Xinhua News Agency, December 26th - The National Agricultural Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Agriculture in Beijing concluded on the 24th. The conference summarized agricultural production during the First Five-Year Plan and planned agricultural production during the Second Five-Year Plan and 1958.

    During the conference, Vice Chairman Zhu De and Vice Premier of the State Council Deng Zihui gave important instructions on organizing a great leap forward in national agricultural production.

    Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan delivered a concluding report at the conference on the 24th. Liao Luyan said: During the First Five-Year Plan, we achieved great successes on the agricultural production front. First, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives has reached over 97% nationwide, achieving the socialist transformation of agriculture from the relations of production ten years ahead of schedule. Encouraged by the high tide of cooperativization and the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, farmers across the country have launched a high tide of production. The total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations and the output of grain and cotton have all overfulfilled the original 1957 targets. Basic agricultural construction, such as increasing the irrigated area and expanding the cultivated area, has also greatly exceeded the original plan. The vast number of cadres have also further clarified the basic situation of agriculture, and cadres and the masses have accumulated relatively rich experience. However, the completion of the First Five-Year Agricultural Development Plan is not comprehensive or balanced. In particular, a gust of wind in the winter of 1956 and the first half of 1957 blew away "more, faster, better, and more economical," weakened "four, five, eight," and some places and specific work slackened, bringing certain losses to agricultural production in 1957.

    Next, Liao Luyan pointed out the basic experience in implementing the First Five-Year Agricultural Development Plan. That is: agriculture has great potential for increasing production, and the problem is that the struggle against nature must clarify the situation, understand the laws, utilize nature, and transform nature, using different methods for different regions, and cannot be uniform. The struggle against nature must have a spirit of innovation, a tenacious will, and the perseverance of the foolish old man who removed the mountain. We must encourage experimentation, support the advanced, and constantly fight against right-leaning conservative ideas. We must work hard to learn the laws of leading the collective economy. We must develop in an all-round way and not lose sight of one thing while attending to another. We must use the method of advanced helping the backward, and constantly move forward in the process of overcoming imbalances.

    Finally, Liao Luyan called on the conference to "work hard for ten years to achieve the forty articles." And pointed out that the Second Five-Year Agricultural Development Plan is the key to achieving the forty articles. He asked all localities to further promote the high tide of agricultural production in 1958. He said: "Ten years look at three years, three years grasp the first year." 1958 is the beginning of the Second Five-Year Plan, and we must firmly grasp it and strive for a great leap forward in agriculture.

    During the conference, the representatives exchanged experiences in developing agricultural production in various regions during the First Five-Year Plan. The many achievements and rich experiences in increasing production in various provinces, special districts, and counties encouraged all the representatives present and greatly enlightened them. Some are also preparing to revise the original planning indicators. Shanxi Province originally set a grain target of 8.92 billion jin, and is preparing to increase it to 9.5 billion jin; the original planned yield of cotton per mu was 40 jin, and it is preparing to increase it to 60 jin. Shunchang County, Fujian, originally set the grain yield per mu in 1958 at 400 jin, and is preparing to increase it to 470-500 jin, to learn from the advanced Jianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in this county.

    The representatives believe that the current situation has many favorable conditions for launching a high tide of agricultural production development and organizing a great leap forward in production next year. The consolidation of the cooperative system is increasing, and the socialist consciousness of the vast number of peasants has been greatly improved after the great debate on the two roads. We must fully estimate these favorable conditions, resolutely overcome right-leaning conservative ideas, work hard in the spirit of revolution, earnestly study the mass line, and use the leadership method of grasping the advanced, grasping the backward, and driving the middle to strive for a large-scale increase in agricultural production.

    At this conference, representatives from many regions also used the spirit of rectification to examine the reasons for the backwardness of agricultural development, and proposed that they must strengthen leadership, learn from advanced regions, and strive for a great leap forward.

    This conference lasted for sixteen days.

    全国农业工作会议规划农业发展步骤
    十年看三年　三年抓头年
    新华社26日讯　农业部在北京召开的全国农业工作会议已在24日结束。这次会议总结了第一个五年计划期间的农业生产，规划了第二个五年计划期间和1958年的农业生产。
    会议期间，朱德副主席、国务院副总理邓子恢对今后组织全国农业生产大跃进作了重要指示。
    农业部部长廖鲁言24日在会议上作了总结报告。廖鲁言说：第一个五年计划期间，我们在农业生产战线上取得了伟大的成就。首先是全国入社农户已达97％以上，提前十年从生产关系上实现了对农业的社会主义改造。全国农民在合作化高潮和全国农业发展纲要修正草案鼓舞下掀起了生产高潮。农副业总产值和粮食、棉花都超额完成了原定的1957年的指标。增加灌溉面积和扩大耕地面积等农业的基本建设，也大大地超过了原定计划。广大干部也进一步摸清了农业的基本情况，干部和群众都积累了比较丰富的经验。但是第一个五年农业发展计划的完成是不全面的、不平衡的。特别是1956年冬季和1957年上半年的一股风，吹掉了“多、快、好、省”，吹淡了“四、五、八”，有些地方有些具体工作松了劲，给1957年的农业生产带来了一定的损失。
    接着，廖鲁言指出了执行第一个五年农业发展计划的基本经验。那就是：农业增产潜力极大，问题是向自然斗争必须弄清情况，摸清规律，利用自然，改造自然，对不同地区用不同办法，不能千篇一律。向自然斗争要有革新的精神，顽强的意志，愚公移山的毅力。要鼓励试验，支持先进，不断地与右倾保守思想作斗争。必须努力学习领导集体经济的规律。要全面发展，不要顾此失彼。要用先进帮助落后的办法，在不断地克服不平衡中间不断前进。
    最后，廖鲁言在会上号召要“苦战十年，实现四十条”。并且指出第二个五年农业发展计划是实现四十条的关键。他要求各地进一步推进1958年的农业生产高潮。他说：“十年看三年，三年抓头年”，1958年是第二个五年计划的开端，必须紧紧抓住，争取农业大跃进。
    参加会议的代表在会议期间交流了第一个五年计划期间各地发展农业生产的经验。各省、专区、县的许多增产成就和丰富的经验，鼓舞了所有到会的代表，并且对他们有很大的启发。有的还准备修订原来的规划指标。山西省原订粮食指标八十九点二亿斤，准备提高为九十五亿斤；棉花每亩产量原计划四十斤，准备提高为六十斤。福建顺昌县1958年原订粮食每亩产量四百斤，准备提高为四百七十—五百斤，向这个县先进的建锋农业社看齐。
    代表们认为，目前形势对明年掀起一个农业生产发展高潮和组织生产大跃进的有利条件是很多的，合作化制度的日趋巩固，广大农民群众在经过两条道路的大辩论以后，社会主义觉悟大大地提高了。一定要充分地估计这些有利条件，坚决克服右倾保守思想，以革命的精神，努力学习走群众路线，用抓先进、抓落后、带动中间的领导方法，争取农业生产大面积增产。
    这次会上，不少地区的代表还用整风精神，检查了农业发展落后的原因，并提出一定要加强领导，向先进地区学习，努力争取大跃进。
    这次会议共开了十六天。
