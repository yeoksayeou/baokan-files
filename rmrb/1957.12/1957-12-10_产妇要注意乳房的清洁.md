　　Mothers Should Pay Attention to Breast Hygiene
    Zhou Suwen
    Mastitis is an inflammation of the breast in postpartum women caused by bacterial infection, commonly known as "milk sores." Mild cases manifest as hard lumps in the breast that are red and painful; severe cases result in systemic fever and pus formation in the hard lumps of the breast.
    Mastitis is a disease, and its treatment is, of course, a medical issue. However, if attention is paid to prevention before and after childbirth, the incidence of mastitis can be reduced.
    The main way to prevent mastitis is to maintain the cleanliness of the breasts (especially the nipple area) and prevent the skin of the nipples from cracking, which could allow bacteria to enter.
    To maintain breast hygiene and prevent nipple cracking, attention should be paid as early as during pregnancy. The skin of the nipples has wrinkles that easily accumulate dirt, so pregnant women should wash them frequently with soap. Then, wipe the nipples with alcohol to make the skin of the nipples more resilient and prevent them from being broken by the baby's suction after childbirth. If nipple retraction is detected, efforts should be made to pull the nipple out. Because retracted nipples prevent the baby from sucking well, the baby will suck forcefully, which can cause the nipple to crack. At the same time, retracted nipples can easily cause milk to accumulate, causing breast swelling and pain. If this is combined with bacterial infection, mastitis can quickly form. To correct nipple retraction, a breast pump can be used to suction two or three times a day, or the nipple can be pulled out by hand. In short, attention should be paid to making the nipple protrude.
    Particular attention should be paid to the hygiene of the breast area after childbirth. Postpartum women should wash their breasts and nipples with soap once a day, apply some oil, and cover them with sterile gauze or a clean nursing bra, then put on clothing. Before breastfeeding, wipe the nipples again with clean boiled water or boric acid water before allowing the baby to suck. After breastfeeding, check the nipples for cracks.
    If a cracked nipple is found, a doctor should be consulted for medication to apply to the cracked area. Breastfeeding should be temporarily stopped, and the nipple will usually heal within twenty-four to thirty-six hours. If the breasts are severely engorged, the milk can be expressed by hand, boiled, and then fed to the baby.
    Postpartum women's hands often come into contact with menstrual pads and are easily contaminated with bacteria, so they should wash their hands frequently with soap, pay attention to hygiene, and should not casually touch the breasts.
    After each breastfeeding session, the breasts should be emptied. This will not only produce more milk, but also prevent inflammation caused by swelling and pain. If a hard lump or swelling pain is found in the breast, it is not necessarily inflammation. The hard lump can be gently massaged while pressing outwards to allow the milk to flow smoothly and eliminate the lump. Do not use a breast pump when the milk flow is not smooth, because the suction is too strong and the mammary ducts can easily be drawn into a vacuum and blocked, leading to mastitis. If a hard lump is found in the breast and it is painful and red, go to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment immediately.

　　产妇要注意乳房的清洁
    周苏妏
    乳腺炎就是产妇乳房因受到细菌感染而发炎，俗称奶疮。长了奶疮后轻的在乳房上有个硬疙瘩，发红，疼痛；重的则全身发烧，乳房上的硬疙瘩化脓。
    乳腺炎是一种疾病，它的治疗当然是医疗上的问题。但是，只要在产前产后注意预防，就能减少乳腺炎的发生。
    预防乳腺炎，主要是保持乳房（尤其是乳头部分）的清洁；不使乳头的皮肤破裂，以免细菌侵入。
    为了保持乳房的清洁，防止乳头的破裂，早在妊娠期间就应该注意。乳头的皮肤有皱折，容易堆积污脏物，孕妇应该经常用肥皂把它洗净。然后用酒精擦乳头，使乳头的皮肤变得坚韧些，以免产后被婴儿吸破。如果发现乳头下陷，应该设法把乳头拉出。因为下陷的乳头不能使婴儿很好的吮吸，婴儿就要用力吸，以致把奶头吸破。同时，乳头下陷容易引起乳汁污积，乳房胀痛，如果再遇上细菌感染，很快就形成乳腺炎。矫正乳头下陷的办法，可以用吸奶器每天吸二、三次，也可以用手拉。总之，应经常注意使乳头凸出。
    在产后尤应注意乳房部分的清洁。产妇每天应当用肥皂洗一次乳房及乳头，抹上一些油，再用消毒纱布或清洁奶罩盖上，外面再穿上衣服。哺乳前，再用清开水或硼酸水擦一次乳头，然后才给婴儿吮吸。喂奶后，应当检查乳头有无破裂。
    发现乳头破裂时，应请医生开一些药，上在破裂处，同时不再给婴儿吮吸，一般在二十四到三十六小时以内即能愈合。假若奶胀得厉害，可用手把奶挤出，煮沸后再喂婴儿。
    产妇的手经常要换月经带，容易带上细菌，所以要常用肥皂洗手，注意清洁，更不宜随便抚摸乳房。
    每次哺乳后，应当把乳房挤空。这样不但产奶更多，也可防止因胀痛而易引起发炎。若是发现乳房有硬块、胀痛，不一定是发炎，可以用手慢慢的抚摩硬块，同时往外挤压，这样乳汁流得通畅，就可以消除肿块。在流乳不通畅时，勿用吸奶器，因吸力太大，乳腺管易被抽成真空而阻塞，导致乳腺炎。如果发现乳房有硬块，且疼痛发红，应立即去医院诊治。
