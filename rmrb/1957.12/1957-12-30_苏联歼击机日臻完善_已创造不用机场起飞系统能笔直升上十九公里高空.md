Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th: The "Soviet Air Force News" reported on the 28th that Soviet engineers and designers have created a system that allows fighter jets to take off without an airport. This system allows the aircraft to take off in any direction from a catapult. The catapult can be transported by a car trailer and can be placed almost anywhere: fields, forests, mountains, and even depressions.

The newspaper described the process of taking off from the catapult without an airport or runway, completed by test pilot and Soviet Hero Colonel Vasily Ivanov. He was the first to use this new method of jet fighter takeoff.

Colonel Ivanov said that although the takeoff process was fast, the takeoff signal flares could always be seen very clearly.

Test pilots who have carried out such test flights believe that taking off from a catapult is quite simple and safe, and any pilot who can fly an aircraft under normal conditions can perform this takeoff.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th: The Soviet "Red Star" newspaper reported on the 27th that a Soviet jet fighter recently flew to an altitude of more than 19 kilometers in the stratosphere. During its ascent, it not only reached its "ascent limit" but also demonstrated its stability and maneuverability at high altitude.

The pilot of this aircraft was Mikhailik. After leaving the ground, he immediately made the aircraft ascend vertically, quickly overcame the sound barrier, and ascended to a great altitude in a short period. When the aircraft reached an altitude of 19 kilometers, he found that the aircraft's capabilities were still not exhausted, and the aircraft continued to ascend for some distance. The article stated that this successful experience is being promoted.

    苏联歼击机日臻完善
    已创造不用机场起飞系统能笔直升上十九公里高空
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“苏联空军报”28日报道，苏联工程师和设计师创造了一种能使歼击机不用机场起飞的系统。这种系统能使飞机在任何方向从弹射装置上起飞。弹射装置可以用一辆汽车拖车来载运，并且几乎可以放在任何地方：田野、森林、山区乃至洼地。
    报纸叙述了由试飞员、苏联英雄瓦西里·伊凡诺夫上校完成的这次不用机场、不经滑跑从弹射器起飞的经过。他是最先使用这种新式的喷气式歼击机起飞方法的人。
    伊凡诺夫上校说，虽然起飞过程很快，但是起飞信号弹始终都可以看得很清楚。
    从事过这种试飞的试飞员们认为，歼击机从弹射器上起飞是相当简单、安全的，能在普通条件下驾驶飞机的任何飞行员都可以从事这种起飞。
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“红星报”27日报道，苏联一架喷气式歼击机在最近一次飞行中，飞上了十九公里以上同温层的高空。它在上升的过程中，不但达到了“上升限度”，而且还在高空中显示了它的稳定性和机动性能。
    这架飞机的驾驶员是米哈伊里克。他驾驶这架飞机离开地面后，立刻使它笔直地上升，很快地克服了音障，在短短的时间内上升到了巨大的高度。当飞机升到十九公里高空的时候，他发现飞机的能力仍然没有用尽，飞机还继续上升了一段距离。文章说，这个成功的经验正在推广中。
