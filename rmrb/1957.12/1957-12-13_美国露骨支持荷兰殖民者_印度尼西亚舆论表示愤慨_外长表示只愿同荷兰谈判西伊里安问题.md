Composite report from our newspaper: Xinhua News Agency reports: Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio told the press on the 12th that if the Netherlands hopes to negotiate with Indonesia, the Indonesian government is only willing to discuss matters concerning Indonesian sovereignty over West Irian.

Jakarta newspapers on the 12th exposed the attempt by the United States and other Western countries to maintain Dutch and other Western countries' colonial interests in Indonesia under the guise of mediating between Indonesia and the Netherlands.

The "Dongxing Daily" wrote that if any negotiations are held with the Netherlands at present, they can only be conducted on the basis of recovering West Irian. Economic issues should be discussed later.

Indonesian public opinion is indignant at the increasingly obvious interference by the United States in Indonesia's struggle against Dutch colonialists.

The Jakarta "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 10th saying that the Indonesian government should protest to the United States regarding US intervention in the relations between Indonesia and the Netherlands. The editorial also called on the government to refuse entry to Gordon Mein, an aide to Dulles and an important figure in the Manila Treaty Organization, into Indonesia.

It is reported that Gordon Mein was scheduled to arrive in Jakarta on the 10th. He was sent by Dulles to collect "first-hand information" about Indonesia's struggle against Dutch colonialists.

US Ambassador to Indonesia Allison has recently visited Indonesian authorities twice, repeatedly expressing "concern" about the anti-colonial movement of the Indonesian people during his visits.

The Indonesian National News Agency pointed out that this action by the United States is an impudent interference in Indonesia's firm measures against the Netherlands to smash the shackles of colonialism.

When US Secretary of State Dulles talked about the situation in Indonesia at a press conference in Washington on the 10th, he once again indicated that the US government wanted to interfere in Indonesia's movement against Dutch colonialists. He said that the situation in Indonesia "is certainly deteriorating," and "this situation is indeed causing (the United States) concern, it is raising the issue of maintaining law and order in this region," and the United States has asked the Indonesian government to "act with restraint."

Furthermore: Major Hasoeno, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Army Headquarters, announced on the 12th that all Indonesian armed forces have been ordered to remain at their posts on standby.

Hasoeno said that all leave for armed forces personnel has been cancelled; personnel on leave have been ordered to return to their posts immediately.

    美国露骨支持荷兰殖民者
    印度尼西亚舆论表示愤慨
    外长表示只愿同荷兰谈判西伊里安问题
  　本报综合报道　据新华社讯：印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约在12日对报界说，如果荷兰希望同印度尼西亚进行谈判，那末印度尼西亚政府只愿意讨论有关印度尼西亚对西伊里安的主权问题。
    雅加达的报纸12日揭露美国和其它西方国家企图借在印度尼西亚和荷兰之间进行调停的名义，来维护荷兰和其他西方国家在印度尼西亚的殖民利益。
    “东星报”写道，如果目前同荷兰举行任何谈判，那只能在收复西伊里安的基础上进行。经济问题要留待以后讨论。
    印度尼西亚舆论对美国日益明显地干涉印度尼西亚反对荷兰殖民主义者的斗争这件事表示愤怒。
    雅加达“人民日报”10日发表社论说，印度尼西亚政府应该就美国干预印度尼西亚和荷兰之间的关系问题向美国提出抗议。社论还要求政府拒绝让杜勒斯的助手、马尼拉条约组织的重要人物戈登·麦恩进入印度尼西亚。
    有消息说，戈登·麦恩预定在10日到达雅加达。他是奉杜勒斯的命令来收集有关印度尼西亚反对荷兰殖民主义者的斗争的“第一手情况”的。
    美国驻印度尼西亚大使艾利逊最近曾经两次访问了印度尼西亚当局，在访问中他对印度尼西亚人民的反殖民主义运动反复表示“忧虑”。
    印度尼西亚民族通讯社指出，美国的这种行动是对印度尼西亚为粉碎殖民主义的枷锁而对荷兰采取坚定措施的行动的无礼干涉。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯10日在华盛顿的记者招待会上谈到印度尼西亚局势时，再次表明美国政府要干涉印度尼西亚反对荷兰殖民主义者的运动。他说，印度尼西亚的情况“肯定是在恶化着”，“这种局势的确引起了（美国）的忧虑，它引起了在这个地区维持法律和秩序的问题”，美国已经要求印度尼西亚政府“行动应该克制”。
    又讯：印度尼西亚陆军总部发言人哈索诺少校在12日宣布，印度尼西亚的所有武装部队已经奉令留在驻地待命。
    哈索诺说，武装部队人员的休假已经一律取消；休假人员已经奉令迅速回到自己的岗位上去。
