"Eliminate the Four Pests" Shock Month

    Seventy-one counties and cities in Sichuan Province have successively launched "Eliminate the Four Pests" shock month campaigns. According to incomplete statistics, in about a month, these places have eliminated more than 620,000 rats and sparrows, as well as a large number of mosquitoes and flies, and have also cleared a large amount of garbage and sewage.

    After the "Eliminate the Four Pests" shock month campaign started in these places, the masses showed great enthusiasm. In Jiangbei County, 150,000 people quickly joined the campaign. The Yibin Special District, with young people as the backbone, formed more than 1,000 "Eliminate the Four Pests" shock teams and groups, including 100,000 people, and eliminated more than 77,000 rats and sparrows in twenty days. Yang Chuanpei, a rat-killing model in Chengdu, has killed nearly 6,000 rats this year.

    Now, the "Eliminate the Four Pests" campaign in Sichuan Province is expanding to all parts of the province. The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee jointly issued a notice on the 25th, stipulating that January 1958 will be the province's "Eliminate the Four Pests" shock campaign month.

    除四害突击月
    四川省目前已有七十一个县、市先后展开了除四害的突击月运动。据不完全的统计，在一个月左右的时间内，这些地方已消灭了老鼠、麻雀六十二万多只和大量的蚊子、苍蝇，同时还清除了大量的垃圾和污水。
    这些地方除四害的突击月运动开始后，群众热情很高。江北县有十五万人迅速投入了运动。宜宾专区以青、少年为骨干，组成了包括十万人的一千多个除四害的突击队和突击组，二十天内共消灭了老鼠、麻雀七万七千多只。成都市打鼠模范杨传培今年已打鼠近六千只。
    现在，四川省的除四害运动正向全省各地扩展。中共四川省委员会和四川省人民委员会在25日联合发出通知，规定1958年1月份为全省除四害的突击运动月。　（新华社）
