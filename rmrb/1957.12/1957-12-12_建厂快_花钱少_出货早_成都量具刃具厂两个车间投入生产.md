Build Factories Quickly, Spend Less Money, Ship Goods Early
Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant Two Workshops Start Production

(Our report) The main factory building of the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant – the measuring tool factory building – has been completed. The measuring tool and gauge workshops located in this factory building officially started production on December 2nd. These two workshops mainly produce standard measuring tools such as micrometers, calipers, dial indicators, gauge blocks and other products.

In order to meet the country's need for measuring tools in economic construction as soon as possible, the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant used part of the site of another factory building to produce measuring tools before the measuring tool factory building was completed. As of the end of November, the measuring tool and gauge workshops had trial-produced 989 pieces of twenty new products such as micrometers, calipers, sine bars, plug gauges and plain plug gauges. In addition, a large number of self-made tools and fixtures were manufactured, creating more than 130,000 yuan of wealth for the country. After these two workshops are officially moved into the measuring tool factory building, they can carry out small-batch and mass production.

Due to the early start of the workshops, workers learned the technology ahead of schedule, thereby accelerating and shortening the time to master new production and new technologies; at the same time, it promoted the accelerated progress of production preparation work such as technical data, personnel preparation, machinery and equipment, and material supply, as well as construction and installation finishing projects. It is expected that these two workshops will reach the designed production capacity three to six months ahead of schedule.

This factory also adopted positive measures to expand production area and increase the output of measuring tools in accordance with the principle of achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results. For example, the carpentry factory building originally designed to produce wooden boxes was converted into the instrument section of the measuring tool workshop, and thatched houses and simple houses were built to produce wooden boxes. The woodworking machinery and equipment were greatly reduced, and the investment was about one-tenth of the original carpentry factory building, but the production capacity was basically able to supply the entire factory's annual need for wooden boxes. For another example, the offices of the factory director, chief engineer, and accounting section in the factory office building next to the measuring tool factory building were converted into assembly sections for dial indicators and calipers. In addition, this factory also revised the design plan. According to the revised plan, the output of several major products urgently needed by the country can be greatly increased with only 58 additional machine tools and 600,000 yuan of investment. For example, the production of micrometers will increase from the original designed output of 39,000 to 160,000, calipers will increase from 78,000 to 150,000, dial indicators will increase from 6,500 to 36,000, gauge blocks will increase from 2,600 sets to 6,000 sets, and it is also planned to increase nine new products such as micrometer comparators. The output value of the instrument section alone will increase by 6.17 million yuan when it reaches its designed capacity. (Attached picture)

### 建厂快  花钱少  出货早  成都量具刃具厂两个车间投入生产

　　建厂快  花钱少  出货早
    成都量具刃具厂两个车间投入生产
    本报讯　成都量具刃具厂主要厂房之一——量具厂房已经建成。设在这个厂房内的量具、量规两车间在12月2日正式投入生产。这两个车间主要生产标准量具如千分尺、卡尺、千分表、块规等产品。
    为了尽早满足国家在经济建设中对量具的需要，成都量具刃具厂在量具厂房建成之前，就利用另一厂房的部分场地生产量具。截至11月底止，量具、量规两车间试制了千分尺、卡尺、正弦规、卡板和光头塞规等二十种新产品九百八十九件，另外还制造了大批自用工卡具，为国家创造了十三万多元的财富。这两个车间正式迁入量具厂房后，即可进行小批和成批生产。
    由于车间的提前开工，工人提前学会了技术，从而加快和缩短了掌握新生产、新技术的时间；同时推动了技术资料、人员准备、机器设备和材料供应等生产准备工作和建筑、安装收尾工程的加速进行。预计这两个车间将提前三至六个月达到设计生产能力。
    这个工厂还本着又多又快又好又省的方针，采取了扩大生产面积、增加量具产量的积极措施。如将原设计生产木盒的木工厂房改作量具车间的仪器工部，另盖草房和简易房屋生产木盒。木工机械设备大大减少，投资约等于原木工厂房的十分之一，但生产能力基本上能够供应全厂每年的木盒需要量。又如将紧靠量具厂房的厂部办公楼内厂长、总工程师和会计科等处办公室改作千分表及卡尺等装配工部。此外，这个工厂还修改了设计方案，按修改后的方案，仅增加五十八台机床设备和六十万元投资，即可大大提高几种国家急需的主要产品的产量。如千分尺将由原设计产量的三万九千把增加到十六万把，卡尺由七万八千把增加到十五万把，千分表由六千五百块增加到三万六千块，块规由二千六百副增加到六千副，还准备增加千分比较仪等九种新产品。仅仪器工部的产值在达到设计能力时，即将增加六百一十七万元。（附图片）
