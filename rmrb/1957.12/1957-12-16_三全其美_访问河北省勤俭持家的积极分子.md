　　Achieving Perfection in All Three Aspects
    ——Visiting Active Promoters of Thrift and Frugality in Hebei Province
  　By Our Correspondent Jin Feng
    Diligent Hands
    At three o'clock in the deep night, Granny Shen Shicai, a sixty-eight-year-old woman from Suining County with many children and grandchildren, had already woken up and quietly gotten out of bed. She tiptoed off the kang, opened the door gently, left it ajar, and headed straight for the big pit at the edge of the village. These days, the village was accumulating fertilizer to lay the foundation for a great leap forward in production next year. Now, Granny Shen was digging mud from the pit into baskets, carrying them one after another to the fields.
    At this moment, the sky was full of stars. Zhu Yurong, a mother of six children from the suburbs of Tangshan City, was also up making breakfast. She sliced yams, washed and shredded radishes, and put them in a pot with cornmeal. Her two-year-old child woke up wanting to be fed, and her five-year-old child was clamoring to get up. She woke up her eldest daughter to watch over her younger siblings. She hurriedly prepared breakfast for her husband, who worked in the coal mine, fed her baby, and then went to work in the fields with her daughter.
    At this time, the east was just beginning to lighten. On the road leading straight to the fields were also Zhao Qiao, the fifty-six-year-old Party branch secretary of Shahe County, Bian Qingxiang, the thirty-nine-year-old production team leader of Hejian County, Li Yingxin, the mother of four children from Xinle County, and Du Dagai, the twenty-two-year-old young woman from Renqiu County. ...
    When it was time for a midday break, they rushed home to cook, feed the children, feed the pigs, feed the livestock, feed the rabbits, sweep the yard, and tidy up the house... They hurriedly stuffed down a bowl of rice, grabbed a piece of cornbread, and hurried back to the fields.
    The sky had completely darkened. In the newly built brick house of Granny Zhao Qiao, the oil lamp was lit, and the branch committee members were meeting to discuss the village's production plan for next year. Granny Shen Shicai was busy attending the village debate, while Bian Qingxiang and Li Yingxin were gathering team members to arrange tomorrow's production tasks.
    Late at night, the heated debate had ended, and people lay contentedly on the kang to rest after a day's fatigue. But in the rural cottages, the oil lamps of the diligent housewives were still burning. Here, Granny Shen Shicai was wearing her reading glasses, stitching lion-head hats; this was her sideline production, which she planned to sell for more than twenty yuan this winter. Over there, Zhu Yurong was rushing to make shoe soles for her family of nine. Bian Qingxiang was spinning thread and weaving cloth, and Li Yingxin was grinding grain by moonlight. At this time, in the mountains, plains, coasts, and low-lying areas of North China, how many women were spinning cotton, weaving cloth, braiding straw hat braids, weaving straw mats, weaving cattail bags, weaving fishing nets, and spinning asbestos under the lamps! Their diligent hands produced such outstanding achievements! In addition to leading the work of the entire village, fifty-six-year-old Granny Zhao Qiao raised pigs, accumulated fertilizer, cut firewood bark, crushed soybeans, and cut grass, working one hundred and thirty workdays a year. From November of last year to February of this year, during the slack season, Zhu Yurong made fourteen pairs of shoes of various sizes and took apart and washed nineteen cotton garments. When she put down the hoe this summer, she made nine more pairs of shoes and sewed fourteen winter cotton garments. She also participated in agricultural production, working one hundred and ninety-five days from March to September this year, for a total of one hundred and fifteen workdays. Bian Qingxiang earned one hundred and sixty-five workdays this year and also fed two large sows, nine piglets, eleven chickens, one sheep, and co-fed a donkey. And the twenty-something-year-old girl Du Dagai and her sister together worked four hundred and twenty workdays a year, which was comparable to the best young men in the village.
    And when Granny Shen Shicai, who had been busy all day, finally lay down to rest, the urgent knocking on the door woke her up from her warm bed. Someone outside was anxiously urging her to go quickly to welcome the birth of a new life. It turned out that she was also the head of the new-style midwifery station.
    Saving an Ounce of Rice and an Inch of Cloth
    The amount of grain supplied to farmers in Hebei Province by the state is not abundant, at 360 jin per person per year. The wealthy middle peasants, who were only thinking of themselves, began to complain loudly. A few farmers who were not good at managing their households would indeed suffer some hunger. Let's see how Granny Shen Shicai eats her grain. Her family of five cooks according to the work, portions the rice according to the person, and adjusts the coarse and fine grains and substitutes according to the season and day. In the spring, when the farm work has just begun, she collects elm leaves and willow leaves to mix in and eat (how well she climbs trees to pick leaves; people give her the nickname "Net Tree King"). In the summer, when it's hot and the work is heavy, her family eats wheat with pumpkins, beans, and coarse grains. After autumn, when the weather is cooler and there is less work, her family eats two meals a day. To ensure that the whole family eats well and the taste is fresh, how many kinds of food can her capable hands make? In the morning, they just ate yam and vegetable rice, and in the afternoon, they eat yam noodles, or add half vegetables and half noodles to make vegetable cakes, and then cook some rice soup as a thin porridge. Today they ate radish and dried rice, tomorrow they will steam thin-skinned and big-filled vegetable dumplings with radish filling and cornmeal, and the day after tomorrow they will stir-fry radish strips with rice, make yam noodles dumplings, and cut yam into slices and fry them into pancakes. In this way, her family eats both economically and well, saving 500 jin of grain a year. This year, they received 450 jin of wheat after the wheat harvest, and they still have more than 200 jin left to eat during the New Year and holidays.
    "One jin of corn has 1,455 grains. Can ten grains of corn be made into a bun if a person wastes a mouthful?" Zhou Yuxiang, the director of the Hejian County cooperative, was calculating this account with the commune members: "If one person saves ten grains, then with 1,056 people in the whole commune, we can save seven jin and four taels a day, and 1,740 jin in eight months, enough for a family of five to eat for a year." The accounts could not be calculated in detail. This made the commune members realize that there were many loopholes in their own waste. All 210 households in the village made a savings plan, intending to save 11,000 jin in half a year as their family's reserve grain.
    This year, the amount of cotton cloth supplied by the state is less than last year, and some people are complaining again: there aren't enough cloth coupons, what will we do for clothing? Let these complaining people come and see Granny Pan Rongkun's shoes in Funing County. These were originally discarded cloth-top and rubber-soled shoes. She picked them up and transformed them. The shoe uppers had sixteen pieces of cloth sewn together on the front, back, left, and right, with neat rows of stitches, making them look sturdy and attractive. Her family of five's shoes are all made by utilizing waste in this way, saving five chi of shoe upper cloth last year alone. Granny Feng of Ji County's family of six used only 49 chi of cloth last year, saving 83 chi of cloth coupons. Her family rarely makes new clothes; they are all made from old clothes of adults. The adults' cotton clothes are made into lined clothes, and the lined clothes are made into unlined clothes. The whole family is still dressed neatly, with some new and some old, some cotton and some unlined. They wear old clothes when working in the fields, and new clothes when visiting relatives and going to market during the New Year and holidays.
    Young girls always like to wear some new clothes, especially when they have income from their own labor. But Du Dagai of Renqiu County is not like that. Although she earns many work points, the blue jacket she made in 1951 is still worn now, and has been dyed six times. The two sisters only have one new poplin shirt in the summer and only one new floral cotton-padded jacket in the winter, and whoever goes out wears it. This year, her sister is getting married, and her mother wants to take out the money deposited in the cooperative to prepare a dowry for her sister, which will cost about 87 yuan. Her family is able to afford it, and she is willing to buy some things for her sister, but she thinks that the cooperative needs this money, so she persuaded her mother and sister, and only spent eight yuan to buy some odds and ends, saving 75 yuan.
    Zhao Yulan's Two Years
    "Being able to work hard and calculate well means that money and grain will never run out," "Eating doesn't make you poor, wearing doesn't make you poor, not knowing how to plan will make you poor for life," Zhao Yulan, a family member of a worker at the Huaxin Textile Factory in Shijiazhuang City, now understands the importance of careful calculation and rational arrangement of household affairs.
    When she was young, her family was poor, and she got married at the age of thirteen. Her husband's family was also very poor, and the day after she married, her mother-in-law went out to beg for food. Later, her whole family worked as beasts of burden for the landlord. After liberation, they were given houses and land, and her husband went to work as a worker in a factory. In 1956, she followed her husband to Shijiazhuang, and her husband's salary increased from 60 yuan to 75 yuan. At this time, she thought, in the past we were so poor, now we have money, we should enjoy it. So she bought whatever she saw, and gave the children whatever they wanted. The children's pocket money alone cost two or three mao a day. She would buy five or six jin of fish at a time, and four or five jin of meat at a time, and a whole bamboo basket of beef at once. In this way, the expenses for each half-month would be used up in only six or seven days. When she didn't have money, she would borrow three yuan here and two yuan there, borrowing a total of 180 yuan in debt. She also didn't plan her grain consumption. She liked to eat baked pancakes and gravy noodles, and didn't eat thin porridge and vegetable rice, so she would be short of grain for thirteen days a month. When there was no grain, the whole family would go to restaurants. One bowl of dumplings was not enough to eat, and if they wanted to eat good food, they didn't have enough money, so they would buy rice and eat it with soy sauce. As for clothing, she didn't wear cotton clothes last winter. She wore a lined jacket over two unlined garments on her upper body and a pair of broken plush pants and a pair of unlined pants on her lower body. Her husband was very angry that she was living this kind of life of being rich for three days and poor for half a month, and the couple often quarreled.
    In January of this year, the Shijiazhuang City Women's Federation called on women to carry out thrift and frugality in managing their households, and the factory family committee held an experience exchange meeting on how to live a good life, and mobilized her to attend; this gave her a great education. In particular, the case of Sun Fuhai in her own street touched her heart. She thought, "Sun Fuhai's monthly income is 61 yuan, and he also has five or six family members, but he lives a good life and even has a surplus every month. My family's income is more than his, and the population is the same, so why are we always short of food?" She was determined to learn from others. Her husband was very happy to see her change, so he helped her calculate the accounts in detail and make a plan for monthly expenses.
    From then on, she used the wages she received in the first half of the month to buy grain for the next month. The wages for the second half of the month were used to pay off debts of 20 to 25 yuan (after the debts were paid off, they were deposited in the bank), buy milk powder and white sugar for the breastfed child for 7 to 8 yuan, and the rest was left for spending money. In daily life, she first paid attention to saving grain, eating a combination of coarse and fine grains, eating a combination of dry and thin food, and adding more vegetables to the rice. Sometimes she would even go to the fields to pull wild vegetables to make fillings. In this way, not only was there enough grain to eat, but also 7 to 8 yuan was saved on vegetable money. The children also didn't spend pocket money, saving another 6 to 7 yuan a month. She also picked up a lot of firewood, grass, and leaves, and didn't buy coal all summer, which saved another three yuan. She also unraveled torn socks to make thread, which could save one or two yuan. In this way, she planned everything and arranged household uses in a planned way. In less than a year, the debt of 180 yuan was paid off, and 100 yuan was deposited in the bank. She also bought new quilts and mattresses, and the whole family was wearing cotton clothes. What a huge change this was!
    The Good Thing of Achieving Perfection in All Three Aspects
    "Silly girl," someone said when they saw that Du Dagai was planning to invest the 130 yuan she had received from this year's final distribution into the commune again to support the commune's water conservancy construction, and they "kindly" advised her: "You have worked hard for so many years, you're not taking anything with you when you find a husband! Investing the money in the commune will only give you an account, and it's better to buy some clothes to wear and buy some things you like." But Dagai didn't think so. She said, "The commune is my home. It has only been built for two years, and the family fortune is still very thin. If I invest, the commune will be better, and my family's life will also be improved. Besides, there are only two sisters in my family, and my parents are getting old. If we both get married, my parents will become five-guarantee households, wouldn't that increase the burden on the commune? If we invest in the commune now, it can be used as our parents' living expenses in the future." In this way, Dagai invests in the commune every year, and has already invested 320 yuan.
    Many activists realize that managing a household thriftily is not only good for their own family, but also good for the country and the cooperative. It is a good thing that achieves perfection in all three aspects. They said: "If there is water in the big river, the small rivers will be full. If the country is strong and the cooperative is rich, our families will also live a prosperous life." They consciously link the fate of their families with the fate of the country and the cooperative. If it weren't for liberation, wouldn't Zhao Yulan still be serving the landlord's opium-smoking wife, being beaten by her with a broom? If it weren't for New China, Du Dagai would have been given away to be a child bride, and her elderly parents would have cried their eyes out and still not been able to beg for food and clothing. Without the cooperative, could Granny Zhao Qiao have lived in her new brick house? Without the cooperative, Granny Pan Rongkun wouldn't have been able to repair her dilapidated house that had been leaking for more than ten years. Therefore, Feng Xinzhi's family of four in Xian County worked hard and earned 632 yuan for the whole year. She saved expenses and only used 317 yuan, with a surplus of 315 yuan. She deposited 100 yuan in the bank, and invested the rest in the cooperative. Zhou Qingyun's family of eight in Handan County earned 1,260 yuan. After deducting expenses of 500 yuan, 600 yuan was deposited in the credit cooperative, and 100 yuan was invested in the cooperative.
    In these new families that live frugally, the successors to building socialism – the diligent and thrifty next generation – are also growing up. The two children of Bian Qingxiang in Hejian County, without their mother's urging after school, would pick up baskets to collect firewood and grass. Li Yingxin's ten-year-old little girl in Xinle County learned how to measure rice and cook from her mother, and also learned to grab a handful of rice and save it when cooking. She said: "I want to be a model of thrift, and also go to the provincial meeting." Zhang Peizhen, a family member of a railway worker in Shijiazhuang City, usually pays attention to saving money. Her older children also save the money given to them by their maternal grandparents or uncles and aunts during the New Year and holidays or on weekdays, one or two fen at a time, and when they have enough to make a jiao, they give it to their father to save. This year, when buying public bonds, the father bought 150 yuan at the station, the mother used the money she had saved from her living expenses to buy 20 yuan, and the four children also took out their usual savings to buy one yuan of public bonds each. The children said: "Buy more public bonds, the country will build more schools and open more factories, and when we grow up, we can go to work like our father."

　　三全其美
    ——访问河北省勤俭持家的积极分子
  　本报记者　金凤
    勤劳的双手
    深夜三点钟，肃宁县六十八岁、儿孙满堂的沈士才大娘已经睡醒一觉、悄悄起床。她轻手轻脚下了炕，开了大门，把门虚掩上，直往村头大坑边走去。这些日子村里正在积肥，给明年的生产大跃进打下基础。现在，大娘正在把坑泥挖到筐里，一筐筐背到地里去。
    这时候，满天星斗。唐山市郊区六个孩子的母亲朱玉荣也起来做饭了。她把山药切成片，把萝卜洗干净切成丝，和棒子面一起放在锅里。二岁的孩子醒了要吃奶，五岁的孩子闹着要起床，她把大女儿叫醒看着弟弟妹妹。自己慌忙把早饭给上煤矿做工的丈夫打点好，给孩子喂饱了乳，就和女儿一起下地生产去。
    这时候，东方刚亮。在那直奔田间的大道上走着的，还有那沙河县五十六岁的党支部书记赵巧的、河间县三十九岁的生产队长边清香，新乐县四个孩子的母亲李英信和任丘县二十二岁的年轻姑娘杜大改。……
    到歇晌的时候了，她们又各各赶回家去，做饭、喂孩子、喂猪、喂牲口、喂兔子、打扫院子、收拾屋子……自己急忙忙塞下一碗饭，带着块玉米饼子又赶回地里。
    天色已经全黑下来。赵巧的大娘新盖的砖房里点起了油灯，支部委员们在这里开会研究村中明年生产规划的问题。沈士才大娘忙着去参加村里的辩论会，边清香和李英信，在召集队员们布置明天的生产任务。
    夜深了，热烈的争辩已经结束，人们带着一天的疲劳愉快地躺在炕上休息。而农村小屋中勤劳主妇们的一盏盏油灯还在亮着。这里，沈士才大娘戴着老花眼镜，在一针针缝那带狮子头的小帽；这是她的副业生产，今年冬天准备卖二十多元。那边，朱玉荣在赶一家大小九口人的鞋底。边清香在纺线织布，李英信在趁着月光推碾子。这时候，在华北的山区、平原、海滨和低洼地区，有多少妇女在灯下纺棉、织布、掐草帽辫、织草席、编蒲包、织渔网和纺石棉！她们勤劳的双手，做出了多么出色的成绩！五十六岁的赵巧的大娘除了领导全村工作，自己养猪积肥、割花柴皮、打榨豆、割草，一年还做了一百三十个劳动日。朱玉荣从去年11月到今年2月农闲时作了大小鞋十四双，拆洗棉衣十九件。今夏挂锄时又做了九双鞋，缝好冬季棉衣十四件。自己还参加农业生产，从今年3月到9月出工一百九十五天，做了一百一十五个劳动日。边清香今年挣了一百六十五个劳动日，还喂了二个大母猪，九个小猪，十一只鸡，一只羊和伙喂一头驴。而二十多岁的姑娘杜大改和她妹子一起一年竟做了四百二十个劳动日，顶得上村里最棒的小伙子了。
    而当忙了一天的沈士才大娘总算躺下来休息时，急促的敲门声又把她从热被窝里叫了起来。有人在门外焦急地催着她快去迎接一个新生命的降生。原来她还是新式接生站的站长。
    节约一两米和一寸布
    国家供应河北省农民的口粮不算富裕，每人每年三百六十斤。一心只为自己打算的富裕中农大叫大嚷起来了。少数不会过日子的农民也真地会拉下点饥荒。看看沈士才大娘怎么吃粮食的吧。她一家五口，按活作饭、按人下米，按季节按天将粗细粮、代食品调剂着吃。春天农活刚开始，她采集榆叶、柳叶掺着吃（她多么会爬树采叶啊，人送她“净树王”的外号）。夏天天热活儿重，她家吃麦子配上北瓜、豆角和粗粮。秋后天凉活儿少，她家一天吃二顿。为了全家吃的好，口味新鲜，她那双能干的手会做出多少样饭食来啊。早上刚吃了山药菜饭，下午吃山药面条，或者放上一半菜一半面做菜饼子，再熬点米汤当稀的。今天吃了萝?干饭，明天用萝?馅玉米面蒸皮薄馅大的菜团子，后天又炒萝?条饭，包山药面饺子，把山药切成片烙黄烙烙吃。就这样她一家吃得又省又好，一年节约下五百斤粮食，今年麦收分四百五十斤麦子，到眼下还有二百多斤留着过年过节吃咧。
    “一斤玉米一千四百五十五粒，一个人浪费一口饽饽，十粒玉米做得出不？”河间县的合作社主任周玉香在和社员们算着这笔账：“一个人省下十粒，全社一千零五十六人，一天就省七斤四两，八个月就省一千七百四十斤，够五口人吃一年的”。账不可细算，这一来社员们明白自家浪费的漏洞还多得很，全村二百一十户订出节约计划，打算半年节约一万一千斤，作为各家的储备粮。
    今年国家供应的棉布量比去年少一些，又有人在叫起来了：布票不够哪，穿衣怎么办？让这些叫喊的人来看一看抚宁县潘荣坤大娘的鞋吧，这原是人家扔了的布帮胶底鞋，她拣来改造一下，一双鞋帮前后左右接了十六块布头，纳着一行行整齐的针线，看起来又结实又好看。她一家五口的鞋都是这样利用废物，去年光鞋面布就省下五尺。蓟县冯大娘一家六口去年一年只用布四十九尺，省下八十三尺布票。她家孩子很少做新衣服，都是用大人的旧衣改做。大人的衣服棉改夹、夹改单。一家人还穿的很整齐，有新有旧，有棉有单。下地干活穿旧的，过年过节走亲戚赶集穿新的。
    年轻姑娘总喜欢穿一些新衣服的吧，尤其是在自己劳动有了收入的时候。任丘县的杜大改却不是这样。尽管她挣的工分很多，她1951年做的一件蓝褂子穿到现在，一共染了六回。姊妹二人夏天只有一件新洋布衫，冬天只有一件新花棉袄，都是谁出门谁穿。今年她妹子出嫁，她娘要把存在合作社的钱拿出来给她妹子置办嫁妆，大约要花八十七元。她家力量本来办得到，她也愿意给妹子买些东西，但是她想到社里正需要用这笔款，她说服了她娘和妹子，只花了八元钱买些零星东西，节约了七十五元。
    赵玉兰的两年
    “会打会算、钱粮不断”、“吃不穷，穿不穷、不会打算一世穷”，石家庄市华新纺织厂工人家属赵玉兰，如今可体会到精打细算、合理安排家务的重要了。
    她小时因家里穷，十三岁就结了婚、婆家也很穷，娶到第二天，她婆婆就出门要饭去。后来她一家都给地主家当牛马。解放后分了房又分了地，她丈夫又上工厂当工人。1956年她随着丈夫来到石家庄，丈夫工资又由六十元增加到七十五元。这时她就想，过去那么苦，现在有钱了，可该享受享受了。所以她就见什么买什么，孩子们要什么就给什么，光孩子们的零花钱一天就得两三毛。她买鱼一买就是五、六斤，买肉一买就是四、五斤，牛肉一次就买一竹篮。就这样，每半月的开支，只花六、七天就光了。没有钱就东借三元，西借两元，共借了一百八十元的外债。她吃粮食也不打算，好吃烙饼，打卤面，不吃稀粥菜饭，一个月粮食就亏空十三天。没有粮食一家人就下饭馆，一人吃碗饺子又吃不饱，要吃好的钱不够，就买大米饭泡酱油吃。穿衣服呢，去年一冬她没有穿上棉衣，上身穿件夹袄套上两件单衣，下身穿条破绒裤和条单裤。她丈夫为她过着这种富三天穷半月的日子也很有气，夫妻俩经常闹气。
    今年1月石家庄市妇联号召妇女开展勤俭持家，工厂家属委员会举办过好日子的经验交流会，动员她去旁听；使她受到很大教育。尤其是她本街孙福海的事打动了她的心。她想：“人家孙福海每月收入六十一元，也是五六口人，日子过的挺好，还月月有富裕。自己家里收入比他多，人口一样，怎么老拉饥荒？”她下定决心要学人家的样。她丈夫见她转变过来，十分欢喜，便帮她算细帐，订出每月开支的计划。
    从此，她把上半月发的工资先买下一月的粮食。下半月的工资还账二十到二十五元（账还清后便存入银行），给吃乳的孩子买乳粉、白糖用七、八元，剩下的留着零花。在日常生活中她首先注意节约粮食，粗细粮搭配吃，干的稀的搭配着吃，饭里多掺菜，有时她还到地里拔野菜包馅吃。这样一来不仅粮食够吃了，还省下七、八元的菜钱。孩子也不花零钱了，每月又节约六、七元。她又拾了好多柴草树叶，今年一夏天没有买煤，这又省下三元。穿破了的袜子也不再扔掉，她把它拆开缠线，也能省一、二元。就这样处处打算，有计划地安排家庭用途，不到一年，一百八十元的债款还清了，银行还存了一百元。又买了新被子、褥子，一家大小都穿上了棉衣。这是怎样巨大的变化啊！
    三全其美的好事
    “傻闺女”，有人看到杜大改把今年决算分红的一百三十元又打算向社投资、支持社里水利建设的时候，“好心好意”地劝着她：“你苦干了这么些年，找婆家也不带一点走呀！钱投到社里也不过给你记笔账，还不如买点衣服穿，买点心爱的东西哩”。大改却不这样想。她说：“社就是我的家。刚刚建起二年，家底还很薄。我投下资，社办好了，我家生活也会改善。再说我家只有姊妹二人，父母年纪都大了，我们都出嫁了，父母要成了五保户，不是给社增加负担？我们现在向社投资，可以作为父母将来的生活费”。就这样，大改年年向社投资，已投了三百二十元。
    许多积极分子认识到勤俭持家，不仅仅对自己家好，对国家、对合作社也好，是三全其美的好事。她们说：“大河里有水小河里满，国家富强了，合作社富裕了，我们各家也会过富裕的生活。”她们自觉地把自己家庭的命运和国家、合作社的命运扭结在一起。不是解放，赵玉兰不还在侍候着地主的大烟鬼老婆，被她用条帚抽打吗？不是有新中国，杜大改就得送给人当童养媳，她年老的父母哭干了眼泪也讨求不到衣食。没有合作社，赵巧的大娘能住上她的新砖房吗？没有合作社，潘荣坤大娘也修理不起她那破漏了十多年的房屋啊。因此，献县的冯新芝一家四口辛勤劳动，全年收入六百三十二元，她节省开支，只用三百一十七元，富余三百一十五元，她在银行存了一百元，余下的都投入合作社。邯郸县的周庆云一家八口收入一千二百六十元，除去开支五百元，六百元存信用社，一百元投资合作社。
    在这些勤俭过日子的新家庭里，建设社会主义的接班人——勤劳俭朴的下一代也正在成长起来。河间县边清香的二个孩子，放学后不用妈妈嘱咐，就背起筐去打柴拾草。新乐县李英信的十岁小闺女，跟着她妈妈学会了量米做饭，还学会做饭时抓出一把米存起来。她说：“我要当个节约模范，也上省里开会去”。石家庄市铁路职工家属张佩珍平日注意储蓄，她大点的孩子也都将过年过节或平日姥姥舅舅给的钱一分两分地攒着，凑够一角就交爸爸存起来。今年买公债时，爸爸在站上买了一百五十元，妈妈将自己从生活费中攒的钱买了二十元，四个孩子也都拿出平日的积蓄每人买了一元公债。孩子们说：“多买公债，国家多办学校，多开工厂，我们大了，好像爸爸一样上班去。”
