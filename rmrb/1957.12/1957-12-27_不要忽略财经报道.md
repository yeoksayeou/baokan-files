    Don't Neglect Financial and Economic Reporting

    Recently, the People's Daily has published too few news reports about financial and economic work. In fact, during this period, there are many financial and economic issues worth discussing in both urban and rural areas. For example, after the autumn harvest distribution, banks organize the withdrawal of currency from circulation, recover national agricultural loans, and absorb deposits. Another example is how to strengthen the supply of means of production in rural areas. Currently, supply and marketing cooperatives, civil equipment companies, banks, and other relevant financial and economic departments are also treating supporting water conservancy construction as a central task. These all need to be reported. In addition, it is hoped that newspapers will not neglect the rectification situation and new atmosphere of the financial and economic departments.

    不要忽略财经报道
    最近一个时期，人民日报登载有关财经工作方面的消息确实太少了。其实这个时期，在城市和农村里，财经工作有不少问题是值得谈的。如银行在秋收分配之后，组织货币回笼，收回国家的农业贷款和吸收存款。又如农村中如何加强生产资料的供应工作，目前供销合作社、民用器材公司、银行和其他有关财经部门，也把支援水利建设作为一项中心工作，这些都需要进行报道。此外，财经部门整风的情况和新气象，也希望报纸不要忽略。
