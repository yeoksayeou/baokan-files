    Notes
    The famous American black drama troupe "Porgy and Bess" visited and performed in the Soviet Union last year, receiving a warm reception and welcome from the Soviet people. However, several prominent actors in this troupe faced destitution upon returning to the United States, spending Christmas in disappointment. In the United States, how many thousands share the same fate as these unfortunate people?
    However, the President of the United States brazenly lied in his Christmas address, boasting that the American people were living the most "happy," "peaceful," and "joyful" lives. Eisenhower's so-called "Christmas address" is more like an April Fool's Day greeting.

    愚人节祝词
    美国著名黑人剧团“波基和贝斯”去年在苏联访问演出，受到苏联人民的热情接待和欢迎。但是这个剧团的几位著名演员回到美国之后却生活无着，十分潦倒，怀着失望的心情度过圣诞节。在美国与这些不幸者同命运的何止万千？
    但是美国总统在他的圣诞节祝词中却瞪着眼睛说谎，吹嘘什么美国人民过着最“幸福”、“平安”、“欢乐”的生活。艾森豪威尔的所谓“圣诞节祝词”毋宁是愚人节祝词。
