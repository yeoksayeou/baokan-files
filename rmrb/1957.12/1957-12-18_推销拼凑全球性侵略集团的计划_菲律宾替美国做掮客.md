Xinhua News Agency, Manila, 17th. Philippine Acting Foreign Minister Serrano announced on the 16th that he had instructed the Philippine Embassy in Paris to bring to the attention of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries his proposal to coordinate the "collective defense efforts" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The Philippine Foreign Ministry issued memoranda on the 15th to the member states of the above three military aggression groups, seeking their opinions. This memorandum stated that "free countries" need "global power." The Philippines suggests holding a consultation meeting in Washington to outline a coordinated system. The memorandum stated that the main purpose of coordination is to ensure that the three regional military groups "take military defensive actions simultaneously" to deal with "international communism."

The Philippines also suggested that these three military groups further piece together their respective strengths. The memorandum said that these regional alliances could also study the following issues: (1) exchanging important intelligence in military, economic, cultural, and other fields; (2) gathering technical talents and sharing them with other countries in the "free world"; (3) reaching agreements on the development of important resources and the supply of these resources to member states.

The memorandum believes that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is the "weakest link" in the "free world's defense chain." It calls for "comprehensive efforts" to improve the military, economic, and social strength of the region covered by this military group.

The Philippines' activities are clearly probing for the United States' plan to piece together a global military aggression group. Not long ago, the US Secretary of State, when meeting with British Broadcasting Corporation reporter Sepeal, said that these military groups "have common interests" and "therefore must find a way to link them together."

    推销拼凑全球性侵略集团的计划
    菲律宾替美国做掮客
    新华社17日讯  马尼拉消息：菲律宾代理外交部长塞兰诺16日宣布，他已指示菲律宾驻巴黎大使馆，提请北大西洋公约国家注意他的关于统筹北大西洋公约组织、巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织的“集体防御努力”的建议。
    菲律宾外交部在15日向上述三个军事侵略集团的成员国发出了探询意见的备忘录。这个备忘录说，“自由国家”需要有“全球性的力量”。菲律宾建议在华盛顿举行一次协商会议，拟定一个统筹制度的轮廓。备忘录表示，统筹的主要的目的是要保证三个地区性的军事集团“同时采取军事防御行动”来对付“国际共产主义”。
    菲律宾并且建议这三个军事集团进一步拼凑它们各方面的力量。备忘录说，这些地区性联盟也可以研究以下各项问题：（一）交流军事、经济、文化等方面的重要情报；（二）把技术人材集合起来，同“自由世界”其他国家共同使用；（三）就开发重要资源和把这些资源供给各成员国的问题达成协议。
    备忘录认为，东南亚条约组织是“自由世界防御锁链”中“最薄弱的一环”。它要求作出“全面努力”来提高这个军事集团所包括的地区的军事、经济和社会力量的水平。
    菲律宾的这种活动，显然是在替美国的拼凑全球性的军事侵略集团的计划进行试探活动。不久以前，美国国务卿在接见英国广播公司记者塞佩耳的时候曾经说，这些军事集团之间“具有共同利益”，“因此必须找出某种办法来使得他们彼此联系起来”。
