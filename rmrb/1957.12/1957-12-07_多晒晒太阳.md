Get More Sunshine
　　Xiong Bingqing
　　There is a saying among the Chinese people: "If the sun doesn't shine, the doctor will come to your door." This saying is very true.
　　People have this experience: on a sunny day, going outdoors to bask in the sun makes them feel refreshed and happy; on the contrary, on days of continuous rain, people cannot cheer up and feel uncomfortable all over. This is just people's feeling. In fact, the influence of sunlight on human health is far more than this.
　　Sunlight contains three kinds of light. One is the light that our eyes can see, called visible light (divided into seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple). The other two are light that the eyes cannot see, one is called infrared rays and the other is called ultraviolet rays. Infrared rays are the most abundant in sunlight. Its heat energy penetrates the skin and deep into muscle tissue, dilating blood vessels and accelerating blood circulation, thus promoting the body's absorption of nutrients and elimination of waste products; infrared rays can also stimulate nerves, improve the activity of internal organs, and make people feel energetic, improve memory, and increase appetite. Ultraviolet rays are the least abundant in sunlight, but they are most closely related to health. There is a substance called cholesterol inside human skin, which can be converted into vitamin D after being irradiated by ultraviolet rays. Vitamin D can promote the absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the body. Calcium and phosphorus are the main materials that make up bones and teeth. If the body lacks vitamin D, even if it ingests a lot of calcium and phosphorus, it cannot be absorbed and utilized by the body. We see that some children get rickets, and some women's teeth deteriorate or fall out after pregnancy, which is because they have long-term lack of vitamin D in their diet and do not often bask in the sun. Ultraviolet rays also have a strong disinfection and sterilization effect. Many infectious disease germs, such as tubercle bacillus and typhoid bacillus, are killed after being irradiated by ultraviolet rays for several hours. Usually, we put the quilt in the sun to dry, or open the windows and doors to let the sunlight shine into the house, precisely because sunlight not only removes moisture, but also a natural and very good disinfectant and sterilizing agent, which is of great benefit to health. In addition, ultraviolet rays can also increase the pigment in the skin and strengthen the skin's resistance.
　　Generally speaking, farmers and people who are often active outdoors do not need to bask in the sun anymore. However, people who often work and move indoors have less opportunity to contact with the sun, so they especially need to seize the opportunity to bask in the sun more and accept the grace of sunlight.
　　Sunshine shines on the earth and is not stingy to all living things. As long as we are willing, we can bask in the sun without paying attention to any methods. However, basking in the sun through glass, in addition to getting some warmth, does not have many other benefits, because ultraviolet rays cannot penetrate glass. In high mountains, because there is less water vapor and dust in the air, there are more ultraviolet rays; on the coast, because of the reflection of seawater, there are also many ultraviolet rays. Therefore, people living near high mountains and coasts can often go to high mountains and coasts to bask in the sun.
　　Although basking in the sun has many benefits for the body, if you bask in the sun for too long, the skin will turn red, swollen, painful, and blistered, and even more seriously, it will cause headaches, palpitations, loss of appetite, general weakness, and poor sleep. This is also a problem that we cannot ignore when basking in the sun.

### 多晒晒太阳

　　多晒晒太阳
　　熊秉清
    我国民间有一句话：“日光不照临，医生便上门”。这句话是很有道理的。
    人们都有这样的经验：晴天，到屋外晒晒太阳，感到精神焕发，心情愉快；相反地，在阴雨连绵的日子里，人就提不起精神来，浑身都不大得劲。这只是人们的感觉，实际上，太阳光对人体健康的影响还远不只此。
    太阳光里含有三种光线。一种是我们眼睛能看到的光线，叫做可视线（分红、橙、黄、绿、青、蓝、紫七色）。其余两种都是眼睛看不到的光线，一种叫红外线，另一种叫紫外线。红外线在太阳光里含得最多，它的热能穿过皮肤、深入肌肉组织，使血管扩张，血液循环加快，因而有促进身体吸收养料和排除废物的作用；红外线还能兴奋神经，改善内脏器官的活动，使人精神振奋，记忆力增强，食欲旺盛。紫外线在太阳光里含得最少，但对身体健康的关系最密切。人的皮肤里面有一种叫胆固醇的物质，经紫外线照射后，能变成丁种维生素。丁种维生素在身体里能促进钙、磷的吸收。钙和磷是构成骨骼和牙齿的主要材料，身体里若缺乏了丁种维生素，即使吃进去很多钙和磷，也不能被身体吸收和利用。我们看到有的小孩得软骨病，有的妇女怀孕后牙齿变坏或脱落，那就是因为饮食中长期缺乏丁种维生素，同时又没有常晒太阳的缘故。紫外线还有很强的消毒杀菌作用。很多传染病的病菌如结核菌、伤寒菌等，经紫外线照射，几个钟头就被杀死了。平时，我们把被子放在太阳底下晒晒，或者打开窗门让太阳光射进屋子里来，正是因为太阳光不仅能除潮湿，而且是一种天然的很好的消毒杀菌剂，对身体健康有莫大的好处。另外，紫外线还能使皮肤里的色素增多，加强皮肤的抵抗力。
    一般说来，农民和经常在室外活动的人，他们不需要再多晒太阳。但是经常在室内工作和活动的人，由于和阳光接触的机会较少，他们就特别需要抓住机会多晒太阳，接受太阳光的恩惠。
    阳光普照大地，它对一切生物都毫不吝啬，只要我们愿意，晒太阳是可以不必讲究什么方式的。但是，隔着玻璃晒太阳，除了得到一些温暖外，别的好处就不多，因为紫外线不能透过玻璃。在高山上，由于空气中水蒸汽和灰尘较少，紫外线比较多；在海滨，因为海水的反射作用，紫外线也不少。因此，住在高山和海滨附近的人，可以常到高山上和海滨去晒太阳。
    晒太阳虽然对身体有很多的好处，但如果晒的时间太久了，皮肤会发红、发肿、发痛、生水疱，更严重的，还会出现头痛、心跳、食欲不振、全身无力、睡觉不好等现象。这也是我们在晒太阳的时候不可忽视的问题。
