Xinhua News Agency, December 5th. The Ministry of Health and its directly affiliated units have begun to reverse the phenomenon of rectification lagging behind the "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" campaign.

As of November 30th, twenty-eight units under the Ministry of Health and its directly affiliated organizations had posted more than 6,100 big-character posters and held more than 1,000 discussion meetings, raising a total of more than 23,000 opinions (calculated by person-times). The opinions involved issues such as guidelines and policies, organizational structure, leadership style, various business operations, and welfare. However, after the high tide of the "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" campaign, the Ministry of Health and its directly affiliated units experienced a phenomenon where rectification work lagged behind the airing of views. The reasons for this included the leadership's procrastination on rectification work, a lack of integration between leaders and the masses, and leaders only "holding watermelons" and neglecting to "pick sesame seeds." At the same time, the resistance and grievances shown by individual leading cadres towards criticisms from the masses also affected the rapid development of rectification work. After the People's Daily criticized the Ministry of Health in its November 24th article "Why is Rectification Lagging Behind the Airing of Views?", the leaders of the Ministry of Health immediately convened a meeting to earnestly study rectification methods, and rectification work immediately formed a climax in its entirety. To date, more than 3,800 opinions have been addressed. Some of these are long-standing issues that affect a wide range of people. For example, in the past, a document entering or leaving the Ministry of Health required at least twelve procedures, and as many as nineteen. Now, the number of levels has been reduced, and a new system for the circulation of documents has been established. Among the directly affiliated units, the People's Medical Publishing House has resolved issues relatively well, having solved more than 150 problems. In particular, it has resolved the disconnect between the editing and publishing work, creating conditions to overcome the serious waste caused by the disconnect between editing and publishing in the past.

Most leading cadres have expressed their acceptance and firm intention to improve on the opinions raised by the masses regarding their ideological style. The manager of the China Pharmaceutical Company accepted criticism from the masses and changed his past style of not going deep among the masses. In addition to frequently paying attention to contacting the masses, he also established a method of receiving cadres of the company at 3:00 p.m. on the 15th of each month. Individual leading cadres held a resistant attitude towards the opinions of the masses. For example, Xu Jimin, the head of the General Affairs Section of the Cadre Training Institute, not only did not humbly accept the opinions of the masses, but also asked others to write a self-criticism to cope with the situation. The leaders of the Ministry of Health have severely criticized and dealt with him.

In order to resolutely implement the spirit of rectification, the leaders of the Ministry of Health are determined to "burn themselves," encourage the masses to continue to air their views, and adopt the method of consulting with the masses to solve problems, rectifying and correcting at the same time, in order to ensure that all opinions from the masses are accounted for, and that the problems existing in the health sector are rectified and corrected well.

### 整改跟不上鸣放现象开始扭转　卫生部领导上决心“引火烧身”

　　整改跟不上鸣放现象开始扭转
　　卫生部领导上决心“引火烧身”
    新华社5日讯　卫生部及直属单位开始扭转整改跟不上鸣放的现象。
    截至11月30日止，卫生部及直属机关二十八个单位，在贴出的六千一百多幅大字报和举行的一千多次座谈会上，共提出意见二万三千多条（按人次计算）。意见涉及到方针政策、体制编制、领导思想作风、各项业务及生活福利等方面的问题。但是在鸣放高潮掀起来以后，卫生部及直属单位曾出现整改工作跟不上鸣放的现象。其原因除了领导上对整改工作表现拖拉外，存在着领导和群众结合不够，领导只“抱西瓜”、忽视“拣芝麻”的缺点。同时，个别领导干部对群众提出的批评表现抗拒、委屈情绪，也影响了整改工作的迅速开展。在人民日报11月24日在“整改为什么跟不上鸣放”一文中对卫生部提出了批评以后，卫生部领导上立即召集会议，认真研究整改办法，整改工作立即在全部形成了高潮。到目前为止，有三千八百多条意见已作了处理。其中有些是涉及面广而又长期没有解决的问题。如原来卫生部一件公文进出，少则十二道手续，多则十九道手续，现在已减少层次，订出公文运转的新制度。各直属单位中解决问题较好的，如人民卫生出版社，已解决了一百五十多个问题。特别是解决了编审和出版工作的脱节问题，为克服过去由于编审、出版脱节所造成的严重浪费现象创造了条件。
    大部分领导干部对群众提出有关自己思想作风方面的意见表示接受和坚决改进。中国药材公司经理，接受群众批评，改变过去不深入群众的作风，除了经常注意联系群众外，还订出每月15日下午接见本公司干部的办法。有个别领导干部对群众意见抱着抗拒态度，如干部进修学院总务科科长徐济民，不但不虚心接受群众意见，还叫别人代写检讨来应付，卫生部领导上已对他进行严厉批评和处理。
    为坚决贯彻整改精神，卫生部领导上决心“引火烧身”，鼓励群众继续鸣放，并采取与群众商量解决问题的办法，边整边改，以求作到对群众的意见件件有交代，把卫生部门存在的问题整好、改好。
