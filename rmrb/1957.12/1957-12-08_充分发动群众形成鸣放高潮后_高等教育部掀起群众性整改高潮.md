This newspaper reports: The Ministry of Higher Education, since the third stage of the rectification campaign, staff members have actively aired their views, posting more than 1,500 big-character posters and holding more than 120 symposiums at the department and section level, putting forward more than 5,000 suggestions (including directly affiliated units). With the formation of a high tide of airing views, a mass campaign for rectification is now being launched.

The airing of views within the ministry focuses on the following issues: the formulation and implementation of guidelines and policies, leadership style, organizational structure, institutional work systems, and lifestyle issues. The first three categories received more opinions, while the latter two received relatively few. The focus of the airing of views is the exposure and criticism of the three isms in leadership and work. In addition to the big-character posters and symposiums held by colleagues within the ministry, there are also five big-character posters transferred from universities.

Due to the nature of its work—directly leading universities—the Ministry of Higher Education's rectification leading group seized the major issues related to the national higher education work raised during the first stage of airing views and began to resolve them. A total of seven thematic groups were formed to solve 45 problems, including political and ideological education, teaching and scientific research, and the implementation of the class line. So far, some methods and drafts have been proposed, and this work is still actively underway.

Since mid-November, general rectification work has begun. The ministry and department rectification leading groups have paid attention to implementing the spirit of rectifying while correcting, and problems that can be solved are resolved in a timely manner.

In terms of leadership style, some comrades suggested that the minister and party committee secretary regularly meet with the masses. The ministry leadership immediately formulated the "Measures for the Minister, Vice Ministers, and Assistant Minister to Meet with Staff Members of the Ministry," tentatively scheduling each minister to meet with cadres once every two weeks. In case of temporary matters, temporary meetings can also be arranged. The party committee also scheduled Tuesday afternoons as the time for the secretary and deputy secretaries to meet with the masses, and these meetings have already begun. For example, someone exposed that at the end of last year, it was decided to hold the "Conference on Planning and Financial Work of Directly Affiliated Universities" on February 12th of this year. After the notice was issued, a telegram was sent to postpone the meeting. Four days before the meeting, it was thought that it needed to be postponed again, and the schools were notified again. For this meeting, 78 telegrams, 7 long-distance calls, and 214 airmail letters were sent. As a result, the meeting was not held. It was requested that the responsible comrade in charge conduct an inspection and clarify the responsibility. The vice minister in charge of this matter immediately issued a big-character poster to review the adverse impact and waste caused by this matter, proposing that no unprepared meetings should be held in the future and that the date of the meeting should not be notified before the content of the meeting is prepared. In terms of work, for example, comrades from the archives section issued a big-character poster criticizing the instrument and equipment section for long-term backlog of files. The section immediately transferred five people to sort out the files and promised to clean up the 1955 and 1956 files before the end of December. Some departments also attached importance to filing work. In the past, the phenomenon of departments borrowing files from the archives and not returning them for a long time was very common. Recently, various units have returned them one after another.

In addition, some comrades posted big-character posters with the title "This is Not a Small Matter" criticizing the ministry's lax labor discipline and frequent late arrivals. According to their statistics on a certain day in October, 182 people were late for work by five to fifteen minutes (including seven department-level cadres and eight section-level cadres). The situation was quite serious. After the big-character posters were posted, they aroused widespread attention from the leadership and comrades. After seeing the big-character poster, an individual party member and department director immediately convened a meeting within the department to take the lead in making a self-criticism, and issued a big-character poster admitting his mistakes and expressing his determination to correct them. At present, the phenomenon of lateness within the ministry has improved.

Regarding participation in physical labor, it has now become regular in the ministry. From September 13th to October 14th, six agricultural labor activities have been organized successively, with approximately 100 to 200 people participating each time, totaling 1,102 person-times. At the same time, a system for participating in physical labor within the ministry has also been established, with monthly labor plans formulated and units taking turns to participate. From September to November, 670 person-times participated in cleaning work such as washing dishes and sweeping floors in the cafeteria.

Regarding the issue of the ministry's organizational structure, everyone concentratedly criticized the phenomenon of overlapping institutions, numerous details, mutual buck-passing, and overstaffing, demanding "bold simplification and reasonable merging." The Ministry of Higher Education's rectification leading group, in the spirit of bold innovation, put forward a new plan (draft) for changing the organizational structure for everyone to discuss. This new plan abolishes the school-managing department and sets up departments according to the division of business (such as teaching, planning, and personnel), merging all overlapping institutions, making the nature of each department pure and the tasks clear, and can also greatly streamline personnel. Around this plan, discussions have been launched in various units, from sections to departments, and joint discussions by relevant departments, as well as two all-inclusive debates. Now the leadership of the Ministry of Higher Education has approved the new organizational plan.

At present, the rectification work of the Ministry of Higher Education is deepening. The Ministry of Higher Education's rectification leading group is concentrating its efforts on researching the issues raised by the masses in a queue, on the one hand, grasping the rectification work of higher education, and on the other hand, grasping the rectification of several specific issues in the organs.

Recently, students of Tsinghua University are enthusiastically launching a debate on the issue of "Red" and "Expert". In the debate, many students have spoken out to criticize various erroneous arguments and clarified that only by taking the path of being both "Red" and "Expert" can we succeed. This is a new batch of blackboard newspapers debating the issue of "Red" and "Expert".

### 充分发动群众形成鸣放高潮后  高等教育部掀起群众性整改高潮

    充分发动群众形成鸣放高潮后
    高等教育部掀起群众性整改高潮
    本报讯　高等教育部自整风第三阶段以来，部内工作人员积极鸣放，已贴出大字报一千五百多张，召开了以司和科为单位的座谈会共一百二十多次，提出意见共五千多条（包括直属单位在内）。随着鸣放高潮的形成，目前正在掀起一个群众性的整改高潮。
    部内鸣放集中以下几个问题：方针政策的制订和执行，领导作风，机构编制，机关工作制度和生活问题等。前三项意见提的多，后两项比较少。鸣放重点是对领导上和工作中三个主义的揭发和批评。除部内同志出大字报和座谈以外，还有高等学校转来的大字报五张。
    高等教育部由于工作的特点——直接领导高等学校，因此，在鸣放开始时部整风领导小组便抓住第一阶段鸣放中提出的有关全国高等教育工作重大问题，进行解决。共组成七个专题小组，准备解决四十五个问题，其中包括政治思想教育、教学和科学研究、阶级路线的贯彻等问题。到目前为止已经提出一些办法和草案，这一工作仍在积极进行。
    自11月中旬起，一般整改工作已经开始。部、司整风领导小组注意了贯彻边整边改的精神，凡是可能解决的问题就及时解决。
    在领导作风方面有的同志建议部长和党委书记定期接见群众，部的领导上就立即制定了“部长、副部长和部长助理接见本部工作人员办法，暂定每两周每位部长各接见干部一次，遇有临时事项，还可以临时接见，党委也订于每星期二下午为正、副书记接见群众的时间，现在都已经开始实行。又如有人揭发去年年底决定今年2月12日召开“直属高等学校计划、财务工作会议”，通知发下后，曾发电报通知延期，到开会前四天，想到需再延期，又一次通知学校。为这一次会发出电报七十八件，长途电话七次，航空信二百一十四封，结果会还是未开成，要求主管负责同志检查，明确责任。负责这件事的副部长立即出大字报检讨因此事造成的不良影响和浪费，提出今后不召开无准备的会，会议内容没准备好以前不通知开会日期。工作方面，如档案科同志出大字报批评仪器设备科长期积压档案，该科立即抽调五人整理档案，并且保证把1955、1956两年文件于12月底以前清理完。还有的司也重视了归档工作，以前各司向档案室借出档案长期不还的现象非常普遍，最近各单位纷纷归还。
    另外有些同志以“这不是小事情”为标题贴出大字报批评了部内劳动纪律松弛，上班经常迟到的现象。根据他们10月份某一天的统计，上班迟到五至十五分钟的有一百八十二人（其中包括司级干部七人，科级干部八人），情况是相当严重的。大字报贴出后，引起了领导上和同志们的普遍重视。个别党员司长看到大字报后，立即在司内召集会议带头检讨，并且出大字报承认错误，表示坚决改正。目前部内迟到的现象已有改进。
    关于参加体力劳动方面，现在部内已经做到经常化了。从9月13日至10月14日已经先后组织了六次农业劳动，每次参加人数约一百至二百人，共计参加劳动一千一百零二人次。同时还建立了参加部内体力劳动的制度，每月制订劳动计划，各单位轮流参加。9月至11月份参加食堂洗碗、扫地等清洁工作共六百七十人次。
    关于部内机构编制问题，大家集中地批评了机构重叠、头绪繁多、互相扯皮和人浮于事的现象，要求“大胆的简，合理的并”。高等教育部整风领导小组本着大胆革新的精神，提出了改变机构的新方案（草案）供大家讨论。这个新方案取消了学校主管司，按业务分工（如教学、计划、人事等）设司，合并了一切重叠机构，使各司性质单纯，任务明确，又可以大量精简人员。围绕着这一方案，各单位普遍展开了讨论，由科而司、以及有关司联合讨论，还开了两次全部性大辩论会。现在高等教育部领导上已经通过了新的机构方案。
    目前，高等教育部的整改工作正在深入。高等教育部整风领导小组正集中力量把群众提出来的问题排队进行研究，一方面在抓高等教育的整改工作，一方面在抓机关中若干具体问题的整改。（附图片）
    清华大学学生最近正热烈地展开了“红”与“专”问题的辩论。在辩论中，许多学生纷纷发言批判了各种错误论调，明确了只有走又“红”又“专”的道路。这是新出来的一批“红”与“专”问题辩论的黑板报。
