　　Scenery of the Motherland—Sites of the Three Kingdoms
　　Along the Baoji-Chengdu Railway line, there are many historical sites from the Three Kingdoms period. This is Jieting, one of the vital passages in the struggle between Wei and Shu, located on the bank of the Jialing River. The conical hilltop on the right is said to be where Shu General Ma Su, under the military orders of Zhuge Liang, garrisoned troops at Jieting. Later, Jieting fell, and Zhuge Liang, enforcing strict military discipline, executed Ma Su in tears in his tent.　Xinhua News Agency Draft

　　祖国风光—三国古迹
　　宝（鸡）成（都）铁路沿线三国时代的古迹很多。这是魏蜀相争的咽喉要道之一——位于嘉陵江畔的街亭。右方圆锥形山头相传就是蜀将马谡受诸葛亮军令守备街亭屯兵下寨处。后街亭失守，诸葛亮以军令严明，挥泪斩马谡于帐下。　新华社稿
