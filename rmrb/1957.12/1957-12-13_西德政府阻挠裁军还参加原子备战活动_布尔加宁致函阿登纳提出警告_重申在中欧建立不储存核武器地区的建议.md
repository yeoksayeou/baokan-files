Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 12th: According to TASS, Moscow: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Bulganin, wrote a letter on December 10th to West German Chancellor Adenauer, warning him about West Germany's participation in the atomic arms race activities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Bulganin pointed out: The NATO Paris meeting is being convened to pass resolutions on new measures for storing American nuclear and rocket weapons on the territory of Western European countries and to equip the armies of NATO member states, including West Germany, with such weapons.

Bulganin emphasized that West Germany, due to its strong economic capabilities, high level of science and technology, and its geographical location, could make important contributions to easing international tensions and consolidating peace. However, the West German government not only is not taking any measures in this regard, but should also be held largely responsible for the current international tensions and the division of Europe into military blocs. The West German government is making every effort to obstruct international agreements on disarmament. West Germany is also participating in the atomic arms race, preparing for atomic armament.

Bulganin pointed out: Turning West Germany into an American rocket weapons launch base and equipping the West German "Bundeswehr" with atomic weapons according to the plans of NATO military leaders will only increase the danger of atomic war occurring within West German territory.

Bulganin said that equipping West Germany with atomic weapons would tie it even more tightly to NATO, which would block the only path to restoring German unification – negotiations between the two Germanys. West Germany is currently facing a choice that will determine its fate for many years to come.

Bulganin pointed out: Abandoning the use of nuclear weapons by all countries, abandoning the use of force to resolve disputes, the Warsaw Pact Organization and NATO concluding a non-aggression pact, and stopping war-mongering and hostile propaganda would all help to restore international trust. Establishing a zone in Central Europe, including both parts of Germany, where nuclear weapons are not stored, is in line with the interests of disarmament and easing international tensions. If the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain agree not to place nuclear weapons on German territory, and the governments of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic also take measures to ensure that there are neither domestically produced nor foreign-made atomic weapons on German territory, then the Polish and Czechoslovak governments would also be willing to undertake the obligation not to produce or deploy such weapons in their own countries.

Bulganin drew Adenauer's attention to the Soviet government's statement that the Soviet Union is willing to reduce or withdraw its troops stationed in Germany and other Warsaw Pact member states if the United States, Britain, and France are also willing to withdraw their troops from West Germany and other NATO member states.

Bulganin said: Measures must be taken to improve relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany, and to expand mutually beneficial ties. The Soviet government is ready to make every necessary effort to eliminate the distrust and suspicion that still seriously exist between the two countries, and to seize every opportunity to bring the Soviet Union and West Germany closer and achieve mutual understanding. Bulganin hoped that the negotiations between the Soviet and West German government delegations in Moscow would reach mutually beneficial agreements, thereby making some progress in improving relations between the two countries.

　　西德政府阻挠裁军还参加原子备战活动
    布尔加宁致函阿登纳提出警告
    重申在中欧建立不储存核武器地区的建议
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁10日写信给西德总理阿登纳，就西德参加北大西洋集团的原子备战活动提出警告。
    布尔加宁指出：召开北大西洋集团巴黎会议，是为了通过关于新措施的决议，以便在西欧国家领土上存放美国的核武器和火箭武器，并且用这种武器来装备包括西德在内的北大西洋集团成员国的军队。
    布尔加宁强调指出，西德由于它强大的经济能力，高度的科学技术水平以及它的地理位置，可以对缓和国际紧张局势以及巩固和平的事业作出重要贡献。但是西德政府不仅不在这方面采取任何措施，而且还应该在相当程度上对目前国际紧张局势以及欧洲分裂成为军事集团的情况负责。西德政府竭力阻挠国际间达成裁军协定。西德还参加了原子备战，准备进行原子武装。
    布尔加宁指出：照北大西洋集团军事首脑的计划把西德变成美国火箭武器发射基地并且用原子武器来装备西德“国防军”，只能增加在西德境内发生原子战争的危险性。
    布尔加宁说，用原子武器装备西德，就是更加把它紧缚在北大西洋集团里面，这会堵塞恢复德国统一的唯一道路——两个德国进行协商的道路。西德目前正面临着抉择，这种抉择将决定西德今后许多年的命运。
    布尔加宁指出：各国放弃使用核武器，放弃用武力来解决争端，华沙条约组织和北大西洋集团缔结互不侵犯协定，停止战争叫嚣和敌意宣传，这些都会有助于恢复国际间的信任。在欧洲中部建立包括德国两部分在内的不储存原子武器的地区，是符合裁军和缓和国际紧张局势的利益的。如果苏联、美国和英国议定在德国境内不放置核武器，而德意志联邦共和国政府和德意志民主共和国政府也采取措施使德国境内既没有本国制的又没有外国制的原子武器，那么波兰政府和捷克斯洛伐克政府也会愿意承担在本国不生产和不放置这种武器的义务。
    布尔加宁提请阿登纳注意苏联政府的声明：苏联愿意裁减或者撤退它驻在德国以及华沙条约其他缔约国的军队，如果美国、英国和法国也愿意从西德和北大西洋集团其他成员国撤出驻军的话。
    布尔加宁说：必须采取措施，改善苏联和西德之间的关系，扩大对双方有利的相互联系。苏联政府准备尽一切必要的努力，消除两国关系之间的还严重存在的不信任和怀疑，利用一切机会使苏联和西德接近和达到互相谅解。布尔加宁希望苏联和西德政府代表团在莫斯科的谈判达成互利的协定，从而在改善两国关系方面取得一定的进展。
