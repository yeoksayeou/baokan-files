Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) delegation in Cairo issued a statement on the morning of the 11th, expressing its support for the UN General Assembly resolution on the Algerian question adopted on the 10th.

The statement pointed out that the resolution takes note of the mediation proposals made by the King of Morocco and the President of Tunisia regarding negotiations between France and the National Liberation Front to resolve the Algerian issue.

The statement continued that the National Liberation Front had earlier agreed to hold negotiations for a peaceful resolution of the Algerian question. Now, it reiterates its agreement to negotiate a peaceful solution based on the recognition of Algerian independence, in accordance with the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter, and on the basis of the joint Moroccan-Tunisian declaration.

The Egyptian newspaper "People's Daily" published an editorial stating that the UN resolution on the Algerian question is a preliminary victory for Algeria. The newspaper believes that the resolution implies recognition of Algeria as a separate country.

New York dispatch: French Foreign Minister Pineau openly disregarded the UN General Assembly resolution on the Algerian question adopted on the 10th. He said that the resolution "does not hinder France's actions in the slightest." In referring to the resolution, Pineau only said that he agreed to accept preliminary negotiations to reach a ceasefire, but refused to place these negotiations on the basis of recognizing Algerian independence. He emphasized that the French government still intends to implement the so-called "Organic Law" in Algeria once it is finally approved by parliament.

    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线支持联大决议
    重申愿意同法国和谈
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线驻开罗外交代表团11日上午发表声明，表示支持联合国大会10日通过的关于阿尔及利亚问题的决议。
    声明指出，决议注意到了摩洛哥国王和突尼斯总统就法国和民族解放阵线进行谈判解决阿尔及利亚问题事提出的斡旋建议。
    声明接着说，民族解放阵线早些时曾经同意举行和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的谈判。现在它再一次重申，同意在承认阿尔及利亚独立的基础上，根据联合国宪章的原则和宗旨以及摩洛哥突尼斯联合声明中所提出的基础来谈判和平解决办法。
    埃及“人民报”发表社论说，联合国关于阿尔及利亚问题的决议是阿尔及利亚的初步胜利。这家报纸认为，这个决议包含着承认阿尔及利亚是单独的国家的意思。
    纽约消息：法国外交部长比诺11日公然蔑视联合国大会10日通过的关于阿尔及利亚问题的决议。他说，这个决议“一点也不妨碍法国的行动”。比诺在谈到这个决议时只说他同意接受预备谈判以达成停火，但是却拒绝把这个谈判放在承认阿尔及利亚独立的基础上。他强调，法国政府目前仍然打算在一经议会最后批准之后就在阿尔及利亚实行所谓“根本法”。
