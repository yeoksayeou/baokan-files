Comrades:

	I feel greatly honored to be able to represent the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor to attend the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions. I would like to extend the warmest and most cordial congratulations from the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor and all the working people of Vietnam to the Congress and all the delegates.

	I am very pleased to be able to meet here with trade union representatives from nearly thirty countries participating in this Congress. This once again demonstrates the unprecedented unity of the world's workers' movement, which is constantly developing. I would like to extend to you the sincere salute of solidarity from the Vietnam Trade Union.

	I was very pleased to hear Comrade Lai Ruoyu's comprehensive report at the Congress and was greatly excited to see the great contributions made by the Chinese working class to their motherland and to witness the rich experience of the Chinese workers' movement.

	The manual and intellectual workers of Vietnam have always yearned for your heroic and victorious struggles. Following the great October Socialist Revolution in Russia, which broke the first chain of the capitalist system, the great victory of the Chinese people freed a quarter of humanity from the shackles of imperialism, thus powerfully inspiring the oppressed people of the world and accelerating the entire process of the collapse of colonialism. The 600 million Chinese people, led by the glorious Chinese working class, have been engaged in socialist construction with a high degree of class consciousness, patriotic enthusiasm, and creative labor since liberation. You have overcome all difficulties and completed the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target, and are confidently preparing to enter the Second Five-Year Plan, which will open up a glorious and splendid prospect for your motherland. Today, on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, there is no longer a backward China of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism, but a liberated China that is steadily building a powerful socialist industry, standing tall in the world and becoming a strong bastion of socialism, oppressed nations, and peace in Asia and the world.

	The Vietnamese working class and the Vietnamese people express their infinite admiration for the creative and extraordinary achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao in the struggle against imperialism and in today's socialist transformation and socialist construction. These achievements have further developed the road of the Russian October Revolution and the basic experience of the October Revolution, making the invincible socialist ideology even more brilliant and strengthening the confidence in struggle of the people of all countries who are fighting against colonialism and warmongering elements of imperialism. We, the working people of Vietnam, together with the working people of all countries, rejoice in your victories. On this occasion, I would like to extend warm congratulations to you and to all the working people of the People's Republic of China.

	The Vietnamese working people and the Vietnam Trade Union have always regarded the revolutionary movement of the Chinese working people and the Chinese Trade Union as a shining example. In the long and arduous struggle for liberation, the Vietnamese working class and the Vietnamese people have accepted many valuable experiences from the Chinese working class and learned from your indomitable and heroic fighting spirit. Today, after defeating the French aggressors and American interventionists, the Vietnamese people are overcoming many difficulties in order to gradually build socialism in North Vietnam and to fight for the reunification of the motherland and for the independence and democracy of the whole country. In this extremely arduous new stage of the revolutionary struggle, we must learn even more from your fine traditions of diligence, thrift, and hard work. The Chinese people are striving to carry forward this tradition in building socialism. We must redouble our efforts to learn from the experiences of the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal democratic countries, who are ahead of us and are victoriously and creatively building socialism.

	We believe that the unity of the Vietnamese working class and the Chinese working class is an important factor in the friendship between our two peoples. President Ho Chi Minh often compares the relationship between China and Vietnam to the relationship between lips and teeth. The people of China and Vietnam have long had a close relationship. In the long struggle against imperialism, we have always stood together. Today, in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, and in the powerful camp of all nations against colonialism and defending peace, we are again supporting each other shoulder to shoulder. The Chinese people have actively supported the Vietnamese people's struggle against aggression in the past. Today, together with the Soviet Union and other fraternal people's democratic countries, they are providing us with machinery and equipment and sending experts and workers to Vietnam to vigorously help us to quickly heal the wounds of war and develop the national economy and cultural undertakings. In our struggle to win the reunification of our motherland and to oppose the conspiracies of the American imperialist interventionists and their followers, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, 600 million Chinese people are firmly supporting the position of the Vietnamese people. We sincerely thank the Chinese people for their sympathy and support for the Vietnamese workers and the Vietnamese people, and are willing to work hard to strengthen the close unity between the workers and people of our two countries.

	We sincerely wish the Chinese working class more and brilliant new achievements and the victorious completion of the cause of socialist construction. I wish your Congress complete success.

	Long live the glorious Chinese working class!

	Long live the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union!

	Long live the unity of the working people of the world!

	Long live world peace!

    越南总工会主席
    黄国越致词亲爱的同志们：
    我能够代表越南总工会前来参加中国工会第八次全国代表大会，感到非常荣幸。我谨向大会和各位代表们转达越南总工会和越南全体劳动人民最热烈和最亲切的祝贺。
    我有机会能够在这里同参加这次大会的将近三十个国家的工会代表见面，感到非常愉快。在这里再一次表现了世界工人运动空前的团结一致，这种团结正在不断地发展。我谨向你们转达越南工会的真诚团结的敬礼。
    我非常高兴地听了赖若愚同志在大会上的全面性的报告，并且看到中国工人阶级为自己的祖国作出了巨大的贡献，看到中国工人运动的丰富经验，感到莫大的兴奋。
    越南的体力劳动者和脑力劳动者，一向向往着你们英勇的充满着胜利的斗争。继俄国的伟大十月社会主义革命打破了资本主义体系的第一道锁链之后，中国人民的伟大胜利使人类四分之一的人口摆脱了帝国主义的枷锁，从而有力地鼓舞了全世界被压迫的人民，加速了殖民主义的全部瓦解过程。以光荣的中国工人阶级为首的六亿中国人民在获得解放以后，就以高度的阶级觉悟、爱国热情和创造性的劳动来从事社会主义建设。你们克服了一切困难，提前、超额完成了第一个五年计划，而且正在满怀信心地准备进入第二个五年计划，这一计划将为你们的祖国开辟一个光辉灿烂的远景。今天，在太平洋的海岸上，再也看不见半封建、半殖民地的落后的中国了，而是一个解放了的并且正在稳步地建设强大的社会主义工业的中国，它巍然屹立在世界上，成为社会主义和被压迫的各国人民以及亚洲和世界和平的坚强堡垒。
    越南工人阶级和越南人民，对中国人民在以毛主席为首的中国共产党领导下进行的反对帝国主义的斗争，和今天的社会主义改造和社会主义建设所取得的创造性的非凡成就，表示无限钦佩。这些成就，已使俄国十月革命的道路和十月革命的基本经验得到进一步发展，使战无不胜的社会主义思想更加光辉，使正在进行反对殖民主义、反对帝国主义好战分子的各国人民加强了斗争的信心。我们越南劳动人民同各国劳动人民一起，为你们所取得的胜利而欢欣鼓舞。借此机会，我谨向你们，向中华人民共和国全体劳动人民致以热烈的祝贺。
    越南劳动人民和越南工会，一向把中国劳动人民和中国工会的革命运动，看作光辉的榜样。越南工人阶级和越南人民，在长期艰苦的解放斗争中，接受了中国工人阶级的许多宝贵的经验，并学习你们不屈不挠和英勇无畏的斗争精神。今天，越南人民在打败了法国侵略者和美国干涉者之后，正在克服着许多困难，以便在越南北方逐步建设社会主义，为实现祖国的统一，为实现全国的独立和民主而斗争。在这个极其艰巨的革命斗争的新阶段里，我们还要更多地学习你们勤俭朴素、艰苦奋斗的优良传统。中国人民在建设社会主义中，正在努力发扬这个传统。我们必须加倍努力学习苏联、中国和各兄弟民主国家的人民的经验，他们走在我们前面，并正在胜利地和创造性地建设社会主义。
    我们认为越南工人阶级和中国工人阶级的团结，是我们两国人民之间友谊的重要因素。胡志明主席常常把中国和越南的关系比作唇齿相依的关系。中越两国的人民，很久以来，就有着血肉相连的关系。在反对帝国主义的长期斗争中，我们一直站在一起。今天，在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中，在各国人民反对殖民主义和保卫和平的强大阵营中，我们又是肩并肩地互相支援。中国人民过去曾经积极地支持越南人民反对侵略的斗争，今天，又和苏联以及其他人民民主兄弟国家一起，援助我们机器设备，并派专家和工人到越南来大力地帮助我们，使我们能够迅速地医治战争创伤，发展国民经济和文化事业。在我们争取祖国的统一、反对美帝国主义干涉者及其追随者吴庭艳集团的阴谋的斗争中，六亿中国人民又坚决支持越南人民的立场。我们衷心地感谢中国人民对于越南劳动者和越南人民的同情和支持，并愿努力加强我们两国劳动者、两国人民的亲密团结。
    我们诚心诚意地再次祝中国工人阶级取得更多的和辉煌的新成就，胜利地完成社会主义建设事业。祝你们的大会获得完满的成功。
    光荣的中国工人阶级万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义各国人民的团结万岁！
    全世界劳动人民的团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
