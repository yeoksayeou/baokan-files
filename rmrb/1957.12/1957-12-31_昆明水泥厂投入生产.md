    Kunming Cement Plant Goes Into Production
    (Our newspaper, Kunming, 30th) The Kunming Cement Plant has gone into production today.
    The Kunming Cement Plant project is divided into two phases, each with one kiln. After the first kiln went into production today, it can produce 150,000 tons of high-grade cement of grade 400 or higher annually. After the completion of the second phase of the project, in addition to doubling the output of high-grade cement above grade 400, it will also produce approximately 40,000 tons of slag cement annually. The commissioning of the first kiln can not only meet the needs of Yunnan Province's construction next year, but also export a small portion.
    This factory was built with the help of the German Democratic Republic.

    昆明水泥厂投入生产
    本报昆明30日电　昆明水泥厂已于今日投入了生产。
    昆明水泥厂工程分为两期，每期一窑。今天第一窑投入生产以后，每年可生产四百号以上的高标水泥十五万吨；到第二期工程完成以后，除四百号以上的高标水泥产量将增加一倍外，还将年产矿渣水泥四万吨左右。第一窑投入生产，既可满足云南省明年的建设需要，并可出口一小部分。
    这座工厂是在民主德国帮助下建成的。
