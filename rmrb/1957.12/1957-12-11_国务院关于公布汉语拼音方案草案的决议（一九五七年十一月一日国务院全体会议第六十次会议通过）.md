     The draft scheme for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet, after being submitted by the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, has been widely discussed by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and its local consultation committees for the past two years. It was also reviewed and revised by the Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Review Committee organized by the State Council, and finally reviewed by an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. It has now been adopted by the Plenary Session of the State Council and is to be submitted to the next session of the National People's Congress for discussion and approval. It has also been decided to publish it in the newspapers so that the people of the whole country may know about it in advance.
     Using the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet to annotate Chinese characters to help literacy and unify pronunciation will play a promoting role in improving school language teaching, popularizing Putonghua, and eliminating illiteracy. It is also of great significance for ethnic minorities to develop writing systems and learn Chinese. Therefore, after this draft scheme is submitted to the National People's Congress for discussion and approval, it can be gradually implemented in normal schools, primary and secondary schools, adult literacy schools, literacy education, and publishing, and continue to be improved in practice. Specific measures will be formulated separately by the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Culture, and other relevant departments in conjunction with the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, and reported to the State Council for approval and implementation.

     国务院关于公布汉语拼音方案草案的决议
　　（一九五七年十一月一日国务院全体会议第六十次会议通过）
    汉语拼音方案草案，经中国文字改革委员会提出后，两年来，由中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会和各地方协商委员会组织了广泛的讨论，并且由国务院组织汉语拼音方案审订委员会加以审核修订，最后又由中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会召开扩大会议加以审议，现在由国务院全体会议通过，准备提请全国人民代表大会下次会议讨论和批准，并且决定登报公布，让全国人民事先知道。
    应用汉语拼音方案为汉字注音来帮助识字和统一读音，对于改进学校语文教学，推广普通话，扫除文盲，都将起推进作用。对于少数民族制定文字和学习汉语方面，也有重大意义。因此，这个方案草案在提请全国人民代表大会讨论和批准之后，可以在师范、中小学校、成人补习学校，扫盲教育和出版等方面逐步推行，并在实践过程中继续求得完善化。具体办法，将由教育部、文化部及其他有关单位会同中国文字改革委员会分别拟定，报告国务院批准施行。
