    The Tianjin Knitting Factory has to go through five checkpoints to get yarn from the Tianjin Yarn Factory: the Municipal Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, the Yarn and Cloth Station, the Textile Administration Bureau, the Supply and Marketing Sub-bureau, and the Yarn Factory. If the Knitting Factory wants to build a house, it has to go through six checkpoints: the directly subordinate superior bureau, the Municipal Planning Commission, the Construction Bureau, the Building Engineering Bureau, the Design Institute, and the Construction Company. It has to go back and forth to the Construction Bureau many times just to apply for land allocation, to demarcate the boundary lines, to submit preliminary designs, to submit technical designs, and to obtain a construction permit, and so on. The excessive number of checkpoints, the excessive number of procedures at each checkpoint, and the numerous back-and-forth trips of staff and documents are one thing; what is infuriating is that if a problem occurs at any checkpoint or with any procedure, the matter is delayed. The house that the Knitting Factory wanted to build was originally intended to be used this year. However, because the Knitting Factory wanted the newly built house to be parallel to the factory's office building, while the Construction Bureau insisted that the house be parallel to the factory's transportation road, the two sides argued back and forth for two months, delaying the design time. Now, not only will the house not be used this year, but it will also cost an extra two thousand yuan for winter construction.
    During the rectification, problems such as the internal organizational structure of the factory and operating procedures were greatly improved after extensive airing of views, full-scale debates. Then, regarding the collaborative relationships between factories, and between factories and government offices, can the number of checkpoints like those mentioned above be reduced or some merged? Or can the procedures at each checkpoint be reduced or some merged? The comrades of the Tianjin Knitting Factory suggest that the relevant leading authorities extensively mobilize the masses to conduct a special "letting off steam" session and a special debate on specific collaborative issues, so as to improve the collaborative relationships between relevant departments based on the results. We support this suggestion.

    建议对协作问题来一次专题鸣放
    天津市针织厂要向天津市的纱厂进纱，必须经过市的花纱布公司、纱布站、纺织管理局、供销分局、纱厂等五道关口。针织厂要盖一所房子，必须经过直属上级局、市计划委员会、建设局、建筑工程局、设计处和建筑公司等六道关口。其中光建设局就得往返多少次：要去请拨地皮、请划边道线、报初步设计、报技术设计、领施工执照等等。关口过多，每道关口的手续过多，工作人员和公文往返次数多，这且不说；恼火的是哪道关口或哪道手续发生一点问题，事情就得拖下来。针织厂要盖的这所房子，本来是打算今年使用的。只是因为针织厂的意见要使新盖的这所房子跟厂的办公楼平行，而建设局却坚持要使这所房子跟厂内运输道平行，两下里来回扯了两个月，把设计时间给耽误了。现在不仅今年用不上这所房子，还得多花两千元的费用来进行冬季施工。
    在整改当中，工厂内部的组织机构，办事手续等问题，经过大鸣大放大辩论，确实改进了不少。那末，工厂与工厂之间、工厂与机关之间的协作关系，像上述那样多的关口是不是可以减少一点或合并一些呢？或者每道关口的手续是不是可以减少一点或合并一些呢？天津针织厂的同志建议有关的领导机关，都广泛发动群众，对具体的协作问题来一次专题鸣放和专题辩论，以便据以改进一下有关部门之间的协作关系。我们支持这个建议。
