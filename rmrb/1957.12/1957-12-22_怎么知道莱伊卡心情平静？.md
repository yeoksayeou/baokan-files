    How to Know Laika is Calm?
    Question: News reports say that Laika, the passenger of the Soviet Union's second artificial Earth satellite, is calm. How is this known?
    Answer: An animal's body activities are often accompanied by very small changes in electric current. For example, each heartbeat has a fluctuation of electric current, which scientists call the heart current or electrocardiogram. Brain activity also has fluctuations of electric current, called brain current or electroencephalogram. Scientists can analyze the condition of these electrical waves to know whether the heart and brain are normal. Similarly, changes in breathing and blood pressure can also be converted into changes in electric current. In the box containing Laika in the Soviet Union's second artificial Earth satellite, there were instruments for recording heart activity, breathing rate, blood pressure, etc. These instruments record the changes in electric current caused by Laika's heart, breathing, blood pressure, etc., amplify them in a radio transmitter, turn them into radio signals, and then transmit them to the ground. Scientists receive these signals and can redraw the electrocardiogram, etc. Based on the condition of these electrical waves, they know that Laika's pulse, breathing, and blood pressure are normal, thus inferring that Laika is calm at high altitude.

    怎么知道莱伊卡心情平静？
    问：苏联第二颗人造地球卫星的乘客，小狗莱伊卡，新闻报道说它心情平静，这是怎么知道的？
    答：动物体的活动，往往伴随着很小的电流变化。如心脏的每一次跳动，都有一个电流的起伏，科学家们把它叫做心电流或者心电波。脑子的活动也有电流的起伏，这叫做脑电流或者脑电波。科学家们分析这些电波的情况，就能够知道心脏和脑是否正常。同样，呼吸和血压的变化，也可以变成电流的变化。在苏联第二颗人造地球卫星装莱伊卡的盒子里，备有记录心脏活动、呼吸频率、血压等的仪器。这些仪器把莱伊卡的心脏、呼吸、血压等所引起的电流变化记录下来，在无线电发射机中放大，变成无线电讯号，然后发射到地面上来。科学家们收到这些讯号，就可以把心电波等重新描绘出来。根据这些电波的情况，知道莱伊卡的脉搏、呼吸、血压都很正常，从而推论莱伊卡在高空中心情平静。
