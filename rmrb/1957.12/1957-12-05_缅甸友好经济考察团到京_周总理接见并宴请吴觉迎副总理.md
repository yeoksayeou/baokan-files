In his welcoming speech, Vice Premier He Long said that after China and Burma were freed from the shackles of colonialism, the traditional friendship between the two peoples had further developed on the basis of the Five Principles. The leaders of the two governments have established close friendship and contacts through frequent contacts, thereby promoting the development of friendship between the two countries.

Vice Premier He Long concluded by saying: "Your Excellency Deputy Prime Minister, China is your relative and neighbor. We sincerely hope that you will be as comfortable and happy as you are at home during your visit."

At the end of their speeches, the two Deputy Prime Ministers shouted "Long live Burma-China friendship!" and "Long live the friendship between the people of China and Burma!"

Then, Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein and his wife, as well as other Burmese distinguished guests, accompanied by Vice Premier He Long and others, toured the airport to meet the welcoming crowds at the airport.
