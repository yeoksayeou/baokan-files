Xinhua News Agency, December 5th. The Tenth Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of Christianity, held from October 28th to December 4th, decided to launch an in-depth socialist education movement among Christians nationwide. Wu Yaozong, Chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of Christianity, delivered a concluding speech at the meeting on December 4th.

The resolution unanimously adopted at the meeting on December 4th stated that the world situation has entered a new turning point favorable to socialism, and the strength of socialist countries and the strength of people worldwide striving for peace, democracy, national liberation, and socialism have surpassed the strength of the imperialist aggressive camp. Socialism is the path for the Chinese people to escape poverty and exploitation and move towards prosperity and happiness. Christians nationwide must, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely follow the socialist road. The resolution requires the Three-Self Patriotic organizations in all provinces and cities to regard conducting socialist education among Christians nationwide as the primary task at present, and to convene regional meetings in the near future, adopting the method of full airing of views, full debate, and big character posters, to earnestly discuss the question of following the socialist road. The resolution also particularly emphasized that Christians nationwide should proceed from the interests of the 600 million people, clearly distinguish right from wrong on major issues, abandon the capitalist stance, establish a socialist stance, enhance socialist consciousness, be vigilant against the conspiracy of imperialism to continue using Christianity to carry out aggressive activities, eliminate the reactionary influence of imperialism and all exploiting classes within Christianity, and work harder to advance on the socialist road.

The resolution emphasized that it is precisely because of the leadership of the Communist Party that Chinese Christianity has been able to break away from the control of imperialism for more than a century, and for Chinese Christians to manage their own churches and fully enjoy religious freedom. Christians taking the socialist road must accept the leadership of the Communist Party.

The resolution then pointed out that because Chinese Christianity has been used by imperialism and has countless connections with the exploiting classes, we must be extra vigilant against the bourgeois rightists using Christianity to carry out conspiracies against the Communist Party and against socialism. Christians nationwide must stand firmly on the people's position and thoroughly expose and resolutely struggle against the right-wing elements within Christianity.

The resolution also called on Christians nationwide to wage a resolute struggle against the evil activities of reactionary elements, hooligans, and bad elements who engage in anti-communist and anti-socialist activities in the name of the church or "free preaching," and requested the government to deal with them according to the law.

In his concluding speech, Wu Yaozong pointed out that the main achievement of this meeting was to clarify right and wrong on major issues through full airing of views, full debate, and the method of presenting facts and reasoning, exposing a group of right-wing elements in Christian circles, and further affirming that Christian circles must take the socialist road and accept the leadership of the Communist Party.

Wu Yaozong called on Christians nationwide to unite more closely on the basis of anti-imperialism, patriotism, and love for socialism, to raise vigilance against imperialism and all reactionary forces, and to actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland and the cause of defending world peace.

During the meeting, Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, and He Chengxiang, Director of the Bureau of Religious Affairs, attended and delivered speeches.

    新华社5日讯　从10月28日到12月4日召开的中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会第十次常委扩大会议，决定要在全国基督徒中开展一个深入的社会主义教育运动。中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会主席吴耀宗在本月4日的会上作了会议的总结发言。
    会议在本月4日一致通过的决议中说，世界形势已经进入了一个有利于社会主义的新的转折点，社会主义国家的力量和全世界人民争取和平、民主、民族解放和社会主义的力量，已经超过了帝国主义侵略阵营的力量。社会主义是中国人民摆脱贫困和剥削，走向繁荣幸福的道路。全国基督徒必须和全国人民一起，坚决走社会主义道路。决议要求全国各省市三自爱国组织应该把在全国基督徒中进行社会主义教育当作当前的首要任务，并且在最近期内召开地区性的会议，采取大鸣大放大辩论的方式，认真讨论走社会主义道路的问题。决议还特别强调全国教徒要从六亿人民的利益出发，明辨大是大非，破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场，提高社会主义觉悟，警惕帝国主义继续利用基督教进行侵略活动的阴谋，肃清帝国主义和一切剥削阶级在基督教内的反动影响，更好地在社会主义道路上努力前进。
    决议强调指出，正是由于有了共产党的领导，中国基督教才能摆脱百余年来帝国主义的控制，由中国基督徒治理自己的教会，充分享受了宗教信仰自由。基督徒走社会主义道路，必须接受共产党的领导。
    决议接着指出，由于中国基督教曾被帝国主义利用，并且同剥削 阶级有着千丝万缕的关系，我们必须加倍警惕资产阶级右派利用基督教进行反对共产党反对社会主义的阴谋活动。全国基督徒必须站稳人民立场，向基督教内的右派分子进行彻底揭发和坚决斗争。
    决议还号召全国基督徒应对反动分子、流氓和坏分子以教会或“自由传道”的名义进行反共反社会主义的罪恶活动作坚决的斗争，并要求政府依法予以处理。
    吴耀宗在总结发言中指出，这次会议的主要收获是通过大鸣大放大辩论和摆事实讲道理的方法，明辨了大是大非，揭发出一批基督教界的右派分子，进一步肯定了基督教界必须走社会主义道路和接受共产党的领导。
    吴耀宗号召全国基督徒在反帝爱国和热爱社会主义的基础上更紧密地团结起来，提高对帝国主义和一切反动力量的警惕，积极参加祖国社会主义建设和保卫世界和平的事业。
    在这次会议的召开期间，国务院秘书长习仲勋和宗教事务局局长何成湘曾先后出席讲话。
