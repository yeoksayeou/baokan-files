    超额90％完成五年计划
    四川省手工业生产增长得很快
    据新华社成都20日电  四川省一万三千多个手工业合作社（组），已经超额完成第一个五年计划。
    据有关部门统计：全省手工业合作社（组）的总产值，到今年11月底已达十二亿多元，预计12月可再增加产值六千多万元，将超额90.7％完成第一个五年计划。
    四川省现在共有手工业社（组）员三十八万九千多人。随着合作化的发展，手工业的生产有了很大的增长。全省1956年和1957年两年内，共生产各式农具五千一百多万件，修补农具三千多万件，有力地支援了农业生产。手工业的花色品种也增多了，仅成都市各手工业社（组），到今年第二季度止增加和改进的新产品就有一千八百多种。成都市的竹、木、棕、藤等业的十八个社，还有一百零五种产品降低成本10％。
    随着生产的发展，全省手工业合作社（组）五年内不仅向国家缴纳约六千万元的税金，还积累了不下七千万元的自有资金，为改善生产设备、扩大再生产打下了物质基础。社员们的生活也得到改善，全省90％的社员较入社前增加了收入，去年工资平均比前年增长14.5％。（附图片）
