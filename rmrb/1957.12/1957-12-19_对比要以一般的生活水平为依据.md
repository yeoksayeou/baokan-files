    Comparisons Should Be Based on General Living Standards
    I feel that in the current rectification movement's great debate, there is a great need for articles like "After the Abscess is Cut Away" on page 3 of the November 25th issue, which discuss the comparison between the old and new societies and the fight against bad elements. However, when citing comparative figures, comparisons should be based on general living standards and not on special examples, otherwise they will lack persuasiveness. For example, the Jia Juxu mentioned in this article, whose family has a monthly income of more than 400 yuan, is not common among the average working people today. In other surveys of workers' and peasants' lives, it is also common to compare watches, radios, woolen clothes, rice, and white flour with the acorns, moldy bean cakes, and cement bag clothes of the past. The lives of the vast majority of our people today are not yet affluent. It is more appropriate and powerful to compare the level of eating well and dressing warmly with the difficult lives of the working people before liberation.

    对比要以一般的生活水平为依据
    我感到在目前整风运动的大辩论中，很需要像11月25日三版“割去脓疮以后”这样的关于新旧对比、打击坏分子的文章。可是在引用对比数字的时候，应该以一般的生活水平来作比较，不要引用特殊的例子，否则就缺乏说服力了。像这篇文章中提到的贾巨旭，一家每月收入有四百多元，这在目前一般的劳动人民中，并不多见。而在其他的一些工农生活调查中，也常常一来就是拿手表、收音机、呢料衣服、大米、白面来比过去的橡子面、霉豆饼和水泥袋衣服。我们今天广大人民的生活，还不富裕，要以吃饱穿暖的水平来同解放前的劳动人民的困苦生活相比较，才比较合适，也更为有力。
