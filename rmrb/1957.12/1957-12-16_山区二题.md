　　Two Poems from the Mountains
　　Rao Jiagan
    Supply Point
    The supply point appears on the mountain, and people no longer have to trek over mountains to go to the market.
    Here, young girls buy beautiful floral fabrics, young lads select their favorite rubber shoes, children buy the pens they dream of, and the old head of the agricultural cooperative buys a corn thresher.
    Their satisfied smiles are as bright as azaleas, as clear as the streams in the deep mountain valleys.
    This is the enthusiastic support and cordial greetings brought by the worker brothers, coming from cities on the distant plains, ports on the coast, or large cities along the riverbanks.
    The supply point is a colorful box, painting the mountains with beautiful colors.
    The supply point is a beautiful song, singing of the wonderful life of the mountain people.
    The supply point is a beautiful bond, closely linking the hearts of workers and peasants.
    Medicinal Herb Farm
    To ensure the health of the laborers, large areas of wasteland have been reclaimed on the mountain to establish a medicinal herb farm.
    The medicinal herb farm carefully organizes and promotes the national cultural heritage.
    The medicinal herb farm carefully summarizes the mountain people's experience in growing medicinal herbs, studies the types and forms of medicinal materials, and researches the cultivation, propagation, and growth of medicinal materials.
    The medicinal herb farm carefully pioneers virgin academic territory, engaging in academic exploration: turning wild plants into cultivated ones, turning perennials into short-term crops, turning plants that grow at high altitudes into plants that grow at low altitudes, turning northern plants into southern ones...
    The medicinal herb farm transports large quantities of medicinal seeds to other places and disseminates successful cultivation experiences to other places; in order to completely eliminate the disasters of disease from the new era, in order to make the broad masses of people live in good health forever.
    Medicinal herb farm, you are the guarantor of health, the guarantor of happiness!

    供应点
    供应点出现在山上，人们再也不必翻山越岭去赶场了。
    年青的姑娘在这里买到了漂亮的花布，青年小伙子挑选到了心爱的胶鞋，小朋友在这里买到了梦里的钢笔，农业社的老社长在这里买到了玉米脱粒机。
    他们满意的微笑，就像映山红那样明朗，就像深山谷里的流泉那样响亮。
    这是工人老大哥带来的热情的支持和亲切的问候，他们来自远方平原上的都市，海岸上的港口，或是江岸边的大城。
    供应点是一个彩色盒，它为山区着上了美丽的色彩。
    供应点是一支优美的歌，它歌唱了山区人民美好的生活。
    供应点是一根美丽的纽带，它把工人农民的心紧密地联系在一起。
    药材场
    为了保障劳动者的健康，山上开垦了大批荒地，建立了药材场。
    药材场细心地整理民族文化遗产，使它发扬。
    药材场细心地总结着山区人民种药的经验，研究药材的种类、形态，研究药材的栽培、繁殖和生长。
    药材场细心地开辟着学术上的处女地，进行着学术上的探求：把野生的变成家种，把多年生长的变成短期生长，把高山生长的变为低山生长，把北方的变成南方的……。
    药材场把大批的药种输送到外地，把成功的种植经验传播到外地；为了把疾病的灾难从新时代里彻底清除，为了使广大人民永远都生活得健康。
    药材场，你是健康的保障者，幸福的保障者！
