　　If we were to ask: Why do people eat every day? Most people would answer: If you don't eat, you will starve to death. There is nothing wrong with this statement, but it is not complete enough. Further research will show that eating is mainly to absorb nutrients from food. This nutrient is to maintain the growth and development of the human body, can produce heat and strength, and can also help the body resist the invasion of diseases.

　　So, how much food should each person eat every day to get enough nutrients?

　　The amount of heat produced by various foods is different. For example, one tael of carbohydrates can produce one hundred and twenty-five "kilocalories" of heat (one "kilocalorie" is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius); one tael of oil can produce two hundred and eighty-one "kilocalories" of heat. The amount of heat each person needs is also different, which is related to body weight, the amount of labor, and health conditions. Generally speaking, adults need more heat than children; people who work need more than people who don't work.

　　The heat we need in our body is mainly obtained from carbohydrates (also called carbohydrates, which is the starch we usually talk about) and fats (oils). Grains, sweet potatoes, potatoes, etc. all contain rich carbohydrates. Generally speaking, adults can eat fourteen taels to one catty of rice, steamed buns or窝窝头 (wō wō tóu, a type of corn bread), and half a tael to one tael of fat (i.e., oil, meat and other foods containing fat) every day, which is about enough.

　　The main use of protein is to grow muscles and bones. When people are hungry, if they cannot get carbohydrates and fats, protein can also generate heat to supply the body's needs. Adults only need to eat two taels of protein a day; children who are developing need twice as much protein as adults. We can get these proteins from one or two eggs, or from beans and other foods.

　　We also need some minerals every day, such as iron, phosphorus, iodine, calcium... These minerals. Among these minerals, the human body needs the most calcium. If the body lacks calcium for a long time, the bones and teeth will be affected; children lacking calcium will suffer from rickets; pregnant and breastfeeding women lacking calcium will damage their bones and teeth. Adults only need to get two li (厘, a unit of weight) of calcium from food every day; women during pregnancy and breastfeeding should eat five to seven li of calcium every day; children who are developing should eat five li of calcium every day. Foods with more calcium include cabbage, dried shrimp, beans and milk.

　　Vitamins are what are commonly referred to as vitamins. There are many types of vitamins, divided into A, B, C, D, E... The amount of various vitamins needed by the human body is very small, but it is also indispensable. Vitamin A is found in liver, milk, egg yolk, sweet potato, spinach, cabbage, and amaranth. Eating three taels of spinach or six taels of sweet potato every day can get enough vitamin A. Vitamin B mostly exists on the skin of rice and wheat, and in sweet potatoes, peanuts, tomatoes, kidneys, and liver. Eating six taels of millet every day can get the vitamin B we need for a day. Jujubes, hawthorn fruit, green peppers, cabbage, alfalfa and various fruits contain a lot of vitamin C. If you can eat six taels of Chinese cabbage or four taels of cabbage every day, you can also get the vitamin C that the body needs every day. Vitamin D can be obtained from liver and egg yolk, or by getting enough sunlight every day.

　　In order to get these calories and nutrients, we must match the food properly. In terms of meals, it is best to eat a mixture of rice, flour and grains; in terms of vegetables, it is best to change various vegetables. This is good for nutrition and can save money. Some people think that eating chicken, duck, fish and meat every day will be healthy. This view is wrong.

### 人每天要从食物得到多少养料？

　　人每天要从食物得到多少养料？
    如果我们要问：人为什么每天要吃饭呢？大部分人会这样回答：不吃饭就会饿死。这样说没有错，可是，还不够完全。我们进一步研究就会知道，吃饭，主要是为了从食物中吸收养料。这种养料，是维持人体的生长和发育的，能够产生热量和力气，还能够帮助身体抵抗疾病的侵害。
    那么，每人每天究竟要吃多少食物才能得到足够的养料呢？
    各种食物所产生的热量不同。例如，一两醣类的食物，能产生一百二十五个“仟卡”的热量（一“仟卡”，就是把一公斤的水的温度，升高摄氏温度表一度所需要的热量）；一两油，能够产生二百八十一个“仟卡”的热量。每人需要的热量也各不相同，这和身体轻重、劳动量的大小、健康情况都有关系。一般说来，成年人比小孩需要的热量要多；干活的人比不干活的人需要的多。
    我们身体里所需要的热量，主要是从醣类（也叫碳水化合物，就是平常说的淀粉）和脂肪（油类）里得到的。像五谷杂粮、红薯、土豆等都含着丰富的醣。一般的说，成年人每天能吃到十四两到一斤的米饭、馒头或是窝窝头，吃到半两到一两的脂肪（即油、肉和其它含脂肪的食物），就差不多了。
    蛋白质的主要用处是生长肌肉和骨头的。人在饥饿的时候，如果得不到醣类和脂肪，蛋白质也能发热，供给身体的需要。成年人每天吃到二两蛋白质就够了；正在发育的小孩子，每天所需要的蛋白质要比成年人多一倍。这些蛋白质，我们可以从一、两个鸡蛋里得到，也可以从豆类等食物里得到。
    我们每天还需要一些矿物质，像铁、磷、碘、钙……这一些。这些矿物质中，人体需要得最多的是钙质。如果身体长期缺少钙质，骨头和牙齿会受到影响；小孩缺少钙质，会得软骨病；怀孕的和喂奶的妇女缺少钙质，就会使骨头、牙齿受到损害。成年人每天能从食物当中吃到二厘多的钙质就够了；妇女怀孕和喂奶的时候，每天应该吃到五厘到七厘的钙质；正在发育的小孩，每天应该吃到五厘的钙质。食物里含钙质比较多的有洋白菜、虾米皮、豆类和牛奶等。
    维生素，就是通常所说的维他命。维生素种类很多，分为甲、乙、丙、丁、戊……。人体所需要的各种维生素的分量是很少的，但是也是不可缺少的。甲种维生素在肝类、乳类、蛋黄、白薯、菠菜、白菜、苋菜这一些东西里都有。每天能够吃到三两菠菜或六两白薯，就可以得到足够的甲种维生素。乙种维生素多半存在米、麦的皮上和白薯、花生、西红柿、腰子、肝里面。每天能够吃到六两小米，就可以得到我们一天所需要的乙种维生素。在酸枣、山渣果、青辣椒、洋白菜、金花菜和各种水果里都含有很多丙种维生素。如果每天能吃到六两小白菜或是四两洋白菜，也就可以得到身体每天所需要的丙种维生素。丁种维生素，可以在肝类、蛋黄里得到，或者是每天多晒晒太阳也可以得到足够的丁种维生素。
    为了得到这些热量和养料，我们必须把食物配合得适当。在饭食方面，最好是米面杂粮混合着吃；在菜食方面，最好是换着各种菜吃。这样营养好，又可以省钱。有人认为，天天吃鸡鸭鱼肉才会健康，这种看法是错误的。
