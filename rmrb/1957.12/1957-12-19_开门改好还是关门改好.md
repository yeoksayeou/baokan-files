　　Is Open-Door Rectification Better, or Closed-Door Rectification?
　　Zeng Zhi
    Is it better to rectify behind closed doors or with an open door? The Rectification Leading Group of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs has found a clear answer from its own work: Rectification must be open to the public and meet with the masses.
    However, this answer was not affirmed from the beginning. During the period of simultaneous airing of views and rectification, the masses of the Civil Affairs Bureau put forward twenty opinions on the institution, working methods, and leadership ideology of the agency. Because the Rectification Leading Group's ideology of relying on the masses for rectification was not clear, it adopted the method of closed-door rectification to deal with it, only convening meetings of cadres at the section chief level and above to study solutions. Later, when it entered the period of concentrated rectification, the Rectification Leading Group realized that its approach was inappropriate, so it handed over the previously researched solutions to the masses for discussion. As a result, the masses raised different opinions on the solutions to thirteen of the opinions. After careful study, the leadership affirmed that the opinions of the masses were basically correct.
    From the handling of these twenty opinions, the Rectification Leading Group of the Civil Affairs Bureau realized that it is necessary to rectify with an open door and consult with the masses. Because first, closed-door rectification may not be perfect, and even if it is rectified, the masses may not be satisfied. Second, with closed-door rectification, the masses cannot see the progress of the rectification, nor understand the situation, which will affect the masses' confidence in the rectification and their enthusiasm for making suggestions. Open-door rectification can concentrate the wisdom of the masses, make the improvement measures more practical and reasonable, and rely on the masses to implement them. When the masses participate in the rectification work, they can also be educated and enlightened, and encourage their enthusiasm for improving their work.

　　开门改好还是关门改好

    关门整改好还是开门整改好？这个问题，内务部优抚局整风领导小组，已经从自己的工作中寻找到一个明确的答案：整改一定要开门，要和群众见面。
    但是，这个答案并不是一开始就肯定地作出来的。在边鸣放边整改时期，优抚局群众对机关制度、工作方法、领导思想等方面提出了二十条意见，由于整风领导小组依靠群众进行整改的思想不明确，就采取了关门整改的办法来处理，只是召开了科长以上的干部会研究解决办法。后来转入集中整改时期，整风领导小组觉察到自己的做法不妥，就把原来研究好了的解决办法交给群众讨论，结果，群众对十三条意见的解决办法都提出了不同的意见。领导上经过认真研究，肯定了群众的意见基本上是正确的。
    从这二十条意见的处理过程中，优抚局整风领导小组体会到一定要开门整改，一定要和群众商量。因为第一、关门整改不一定能做到尽善尽美，就是改了，群众也不一定满意。第二、关门整改，群众看不见整改的动静，不了解整改的情况，就会影响到群众对整改的信心和提意见的积极性。开门整改就可以集中群众的智慧，把改进办法订得更加切实、合理，而且可以依靠群众去贯彻执行。群众参与了整改工作，也可以从中受到教育和启发，鼓舞他们改进工作的积极性。
