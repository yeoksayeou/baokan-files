Xinhua News Agency, 10th December: TASS reports: Soviet Academician Sedov stated in "Pravda" on the 10th that the Soviet Union has not had a single failed experiment in launching artificial satellites. They have only experimented twice, and both were successful.

Sedov pointed out that the launch of the Soviet satellites was slightly ahead of schedule. He emphasized that the initial decisions regarding the structural design of the artificial satellite and the selection of the launching system were correct, which played a significant role. These were found based on the future development prospects of interstellar flight.

Referring to the difficulties encountered by the United States in launching artificial satellites, the author said that this once again emphasizes the complexity of the issue. I believe that after some time, American experts will be able to successfully launch artificial satellites. Soviet experts sincerely hope that American scientists and engineers will succeed. Sedov said that because the United States has many experienced and highly skilled experts in rocket technology.

Sedov said that we hope that artificial satellites and cosmic flying devices will lay a good foundation for peaceful competition, for joint work in solving the great tasks of future interstellar transport, and for consolidating the cause of world peace.

Editor's Note: In order to conceal its embarrassing failure to launch artificial satellites, which has become a laughingstock, the American authorities are doing their best to spread rumors, saying that the Soviet Union had failed more than ten times before successfully launching satellites. This self-deprecating trick is really clumsy.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th December: TASS reports: Soviet Academician Muskhelishvili pointed out in an article published in "Pravda" on the 10th that the successful launch of the Soviet artificial Earth satellite is related to the general principles of Soviet scientific organization. Planning, collectivism of labor, and the combination of profound theoretical research with extensive practice are the characteristics of Soviet scientific development.

The author pointed out that without profound theoretical research, there can be no truly significant progress in the field of modern science and technology. The Soviet Union has a very high level in theoretical research.

Referring to the failure of the United States to launch artificial satellites, Muskhelishvili said that this "at the very least partially explains a certain degree of neglect of theoretical research and an overestimation of the significance of purely experimental methods."

### 苏联科学家宣布  苏联发射卫星从未失败

    苏联科学家宣布
    苏联发射卫星从未失败
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社消息：苏联科学院院士塞道夫10日在“真理报”上发表文章说，苏联在发射人造卫星中没有一次失败的试验，只试验过两次，两次都成功了。
    塞道夫指出，苏联卫星的发射比预定的时间早一点。他强调说，有关人造卫星的构造设计和发射系统方案的挑选的决定一开始就是正确的，这起了很大作用。它们是根据星际飞行进一步发展的远景找出来的。
    在谈到美国发射人造卫星的困难时，作者说，这再一次强调说明这一问题的复杂性。我认为，经过若干时候，美国专家们将能成功地发射人造卫星。苏联专家真诚地希望美国科学家和工程师获得成功。塞道夫说，因为美国有许多火箭技术方面的有经验、极熟练的专家。
    塞道夫说，我们希望，人造卫星和宇宙飞行装置将为和平竞赛，为在解决未来星际交通巨大任务方面展开共同工作，为巩固世界和平的事业打下良好的基础。
    编者按　美国当局为了要掩饰它贻笑天下的发射人造卫星失败丑剧，竭力散布谣言，说什么苏联成功地发射卫星以前也曾失败过十多次。这种自我解嘲的伎俩实在拙劣透顶。
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社消息：苏联科学院院士穆斯赫利什维利10日在“真理报”上发表文章指出，苏联发射人造地球卫星成功，是与苏联科学组织的总原则有关联的。计划性、劳动的集体性以及精深的理论研究同广泛的实践相结合，是苏联科学发展的特点。
    作者指出，现代科学技术领域里没有精深的理论研究，就不可能有真正巨大的进展。苏联在理论研究方面有着很高的水平。
    在谈到美国发射人造卫星失败时，穆斯赫利什维利说，这件事“最低限度是部分地说明了对理论研究的某种程度的轻视和对纯粹实验方法的意义的过分夸大”。
