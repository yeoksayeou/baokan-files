　　The Story of Distributing Housing
　　Tangshan Qixin Cement Factory　Zeng Xianchun
　　The factory freed up a batch of public housing. Master Yang said to his apprentice, "Little Li, we'll have to drink wedding wine this time. Is this a big deal?" Little Li grinned: "I'll do it when the housing is approved!"
　　The list of public housing allocations was announced, but Little Li's name wasn't on it. Zhang Shun, a technician in the group, got a room. Little Li was furious: "Humph! It's true that those near the water get the moon first. The section chief actually gave the house to his cousin..." "Haha! Little Li still has to sleep in a single bed!" "It doesn't matter if you get married later, the taste of love is sweeter..." Everyone's teasing made Little Li even more upset. In a fit of anger, he went to the welfare section chief.
　　After work, the section chief held a group discussion. Little Li sat in the front row with a sullen face, still not over his anger. The section chief began by saying: "Currently, the new public housing in our factory hasn't been completed. There are only a few rooms freed up by transferred employees, but there are too many people who want housing. Everyone should unite and help each other..." Before the chairman finished speaking, Little Li interrupted: "Forget it, what's there to explain? Your cousin already lives in public housing, why give him another one?" The section chief smiled and comforted him: "Little Li, don't be angry, you don't understand the inside story... Let everyone re-evaluate it now." The section chief first glanced at Zhang Shun. "Comrade Zhang Shun: tell us about your situation first." Zhang Shun sat there blankly, not saying a word. The union group leader also tried to persuade him, but he remained silent. The section chief had no choice but to say: "If not, let Little Li speak first." Little Li stood up unceremoniously, looked at everyone, and said: "My girlfriend and I have been together for over a year. Her parents have passed away, and she's living with her sister. Eating, drinking, and living are all inconvenient for them..." As soon as young worker Zhang Hu heard this, he chimed in: "Marriage is a big deal, the chairman should care about the youth."
　　The chairman looked at Zhang Shun again. Zhang Shun looked at Little Li's angry face, his lips moved, but he still didn't speak. Old Master Liu, who was sitting next to him, couldn't stand this cowardly behavior and stood up to speak for him: "That's right, Zhang Shun does live in public housing. I'm his neighbor," the room buzzed with chatter, and Old Master Liu continued: "But Zhang Shun's family has many people, and two rooms aren't enough. His parents are over sixty years old and live on a kang built in the kitchen. It's dilapidated and dangerous. Summer is okay, but now it's winter. They've been applying for housing for a long time, but nothing has been freed up until now. This time it's finally been approved. I think Little Li getting married a little later is better than letting elderly people suffer from the cold." "That's right!" many people echoed. The section chief also added: "I think the same way as Old Master Liu, and plus, the room that's been freed up is right next to Zhang Shun's. It's convenient for the whole family to live together. When the new housing is built, it will be great for Little Li to live in a new house with his new bride... How about this, let everyone evaluate it."
　　The room was silent for a moment. Zhang Shun had never been one to "grab the lead" in anything. Now, because of a room, he was having a pretty bad time with Little Li. He thought to himself: Young people are in a hurry to get married, so I'll just give him the house and figure out another way. If I don't, I'll feel bad... Thinking of this, Zhang Shun stood up and said: "There's no need to evaluate it. It's a good thing for young people to get married. Give him the house. I'll move my parents to the upper room, and I'll move to the kitchen..."
　　The room buzzed again. Master Yang, who was sitting next to Little Li, hadn't said a word or expressed his attitude. He had initially thought that the house would definitely be given to Little Li, but after hearing about Zhang Shun's situation, he agreed to let Zhang Shun's elderly parents live in the house. At this moment, the section chief saw that he hadn't spoken and came over to ask him. Master Yang's heart, which had just calmed down, started pounding again, "Oh, ah, ... let me think about it...", and then he sat down again. That's right, it's really inconvenient for Little Li's girlfriend to always stay at her sister's house. I remember two months ago, she specifically came to the factory twice to discuss it with Little Li. It would really be difficult for him to get married any later.
　　Suddenly, Master Yang seemed to remember something and stood up, saying: "Chairman, give the house to Zhang Shun. I have a solution for Little Li's housing." Everyone was surprised to hear this and looked at him with astonished eyes. Master Yang continued: "What the chairman said just now is right, everyone should unite and help each other. I live in two rooms. I used to have many children. Now the eldest son has graduated from technical school and been assigned to a factory, living in a single dormitory. The second daughter passed the teacher's college exam in the summer and lives at school. The east room is only occupied by my mother. We can combine it with our room and give this room to Little Li..." Everyone laughed when they heard this, and some couldn't help but applaud. Suddenly, Master Yang seemed to remember something and said to Little Li: "Young man, when my daughter comes back for vacation, I'll have to let my mother stay at your place!"

　　分房子的故事
    唐山启新水泥厂　曾宪春
    厂里腾出一批公房，杨师傅对徒弟说：“小李子，这回可得喝喜酒了，多?办大事哪？”小李嘻嘻地乐着：“批下房子就办！”
    分配公房名单公布了，可是没有小李的份儿，小组里的技工张顺分得了一间。小李子心里可火了：“哼！真是近水楼台先得月，科长竟把房子分给他的表哥了……”“哈哈！小李子还得睡单被窝呀！”“晚点结婚不要紧，恋爱的滋味更甜……”你一言我一语闹得小李子更不得劲，一赌气找福利科长去了。
    下班后科长召开个小组讨论会。小李坐在头排凳上绷着脸气还没消。科长先说：“目前咱厂新盖的公房还没完工，仅有调走的职工腾出几间房子，可是要房子的人太多，大家要团结互助……”主席没说完，小李子半途上就插上一杠子：“算了，还解释什么，你表兄住着公房，为什么还分给他？”科长笑着安慰说：“小李，别生气，你是不了解这里的内情……现在让大家重评一次吧。”科长先朝张顺望了一眼，“张顺同志：你先摆摆你的情况。”张顺呆呆地坐着不吭声，工会小组长也来劝着，他还是一言不发。科长没法，就说：“若不，先让小李说说吧。”小李子不客气地站了起来，望了望大伙说起来：“我的对象搞成一年多了，她父母下世了，住在姐姐家，吃、喝、住，样样麻烦人家都不方便……”，青工张虎一听忙帮腔说：“结婚是大事，主席应该关心青年。”
    主席又看看张顺，张顺看看小李气呼呼的样子，嘴唇动了动还是没说话。坐在身旁的刘师傅看不惯这种窝囊劲，站起来替他说：“不错，张顺是住着公房，我和他还是邻居，”屋子里嘁嘁喳喳一阵，刘师傅接着说：可是张顺家人口多，二间房住不下，他的父母六十多岁，住在厨房里搭的炕上，破漏的有危险，夏天还好说，可是现在到冬天了，早就申请要房子总没有腾空的，这次才算批下来。我看，小李晚点结婚总比让上年纪人受冷受冻强。”“对呀！”许多人同声应着。科长也补充说：“我和刘师傅想的一样，又加上腾出的这间房子和张顺紧挨着，分给他，一家人住在一起还方便，等新房盖好，小李子新人住新房多美……这样吧，还是让大家评定。”
    屋子里沉默了片刻。张顺从来办事就不会“抢尖”，现在因为一间房子和小李闹的挺不得劲。心里盘算：青年人结婚也挺急，把房子就给他吧，自己另想办法，弄不好都过意不去……想到这儿，张顺站起来说话了：“不用评了，青年人结婚是好事，把房子分给他吧，我把父母换到上屋来，我搬到厨房去住……”
    屋子里又嗡嗡起来。坐在小李身旁的杨师傅一言未发，也没表示态度。他先以为房子准能分给小李，可是听了张顺的情况，却又同意把房子让给张顺的老人住。这时科长看到他没发言就过来问他，杨师傅刚刚静下来的心，又突突跳起来，“哦，啊，……等我想想吧……”，说完又坐下了。是哩，小李子爱人总在姐姐家呆着也真不便，记得头两个月她还特意来厂里找小李商量两次，要是再让他晚结婚也真是为难。
    突然，杨师傅像想起了什么，站起来说：“主席，把房子给张顺吧，小李子用房子我有办法。”大家一听，都对他投过惊奇的眼光。杨师傅接着说：“主席刚才说的对，大家要团结互助，我住的是两间房，从前孩子多，如今大小子技校毕业分配到工厂住单身宿舍，二闺女夏天又考上了师范，住校了，东间房只有母亲一个人住，可以并到我们屋，把这间屋让给小李子……”大伙儿一听，全乐了，有人忍不住拍起手来。忽然，杨师傅像想起点事，朝小李说：“小伙子，我闺女放假回来，可得让我母亲到你们屋借宿呀！”
