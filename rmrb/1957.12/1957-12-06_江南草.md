　　Jiangnan Grass
　　Li Ji

　　In the autumn when chrysanthemums were in full bloom, I came to Jiangnan for the first time. Although my visit was hurried and my departure was rushed, your beauty exceeded my imagination a thousand times over. Looking at your cities of brocade-like flowers, even the most magnificent paintings lose their color; strolling through the picturesque water towns, even the immortal verses passed down through the ages seem pale. People say, "Above there is heaven, below there are Suzhou and Hangzhou." Heaven is merely a fantasy woven by people according to your image. Your beauty makes me feel ashamed: my vocabulary cannot find a single word to describe you. I know that autumn cannot fully reveal your magical beauty, and what I have seen is only a blade of grass in your thousand-mile flower land. But, I must return, I must return with this blade of grass. I want to take this blade of grass to the desert, I want to take this blade of grass back to my hometown. I want to plant it on the Gobi Desert, and I also want to say this to my fellow villagers: "Water it with our sweat, let us make the Gobi Desert as beautiful as Jiangnan!"

　　江南草
　　李季菊花怒放的秋天，我第一次来到了江南。虽然我来也匆匆，去又忙忙，但你的美丽却一千倍地超过了我的想像。望着你那花团锦绣的城市，最瑰丽的画卷都失去了颜色；漫步在风光明媚的水乡，就是传诵千古的绝句也显得苍白。人们说：“上有天堂，下有苏杭”，天堂只不过是人们按照你的模样编织的幻想。你的美丽使我感到羞愧：词囊里竟找不到一个形容你的词汇。我知道秋日里还不能显出你的神奇美妙，我见到的也只是你那千里花乡中的一棵草。可是，我就要回去了，我就要带着这片草叶回去了。我要把这片草叶带到沙漠上，我要把这片草叶带回我的家乡。我要把它种在戈壁滩上，我还要对我的乡亲们这样讲：“用我们的汗水灌浇它吧，让我们把大戈壁滩也变得像江南一样！”
