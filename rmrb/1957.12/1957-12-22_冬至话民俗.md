    Talking About Winter Solstice Folk Customs
    Zuo Huan
    In the past, the Winter Solstice festival was no smaller than the New Year's Day holiday in our country. People regarded this day as a solemn and important one. Some families, even if they had to borrow money, would put on new clothes on this day, prepare food and drink, worship their ancestors, and congratulate each other. From the saying "Fat Winter Solstice, Lean New Year," we can infer the importance people attached to "Winter Solstice" at that time.
    In the countryside, once the Winter Solstice arrives, the agricultural work of the year comes to an end, and the agricultural work of the coming year begins from this point. Therefore, the Winter Solstice is known as "Little New Year." The words "Little New Year" can be found in Cao Zijian's collection, proving that this name existed as early as the end of the Han Dynasty. The Xiaojing Yuanshenqi says: "The yang qi sprouts at the Winter Solstice, harvest taro, reap beans and rice, with no idle days, and no idle hands." This probably refers to the southern regions where the climate is relatively warm. Some people choose grain seeds on this day, taking one liter of each type of grain seed, placing them in cloth bags, and burying them under the north wall in the shade. Fifty days after the Winter Solstice, they take out the ones with the most sprouts to use as seeds for the coming year. Others say that if you water the roots of crabapple flowers with fermented grain residue on the morning of the Winter Solstice, the flowers will be exceptionally bright next year.

    冬至话民俗
    左宦
    冬至这个节令，过去在我国并不小于元旦佳节。他们把这天看成是庄严隆重的日子。有的家庭，那怕是向人借钱，也要在这天穿上新衣，备办饮食、祭祀祖先，彼此往来庆贺。这从“肥冬瘦年”一句谚语中，我们也可以推测到当时人们对“冬至”的重视。
    在农村，一到冬至日，当年的农作业告一段落，来年的农作业以此开始，因此冬至有“亚岁”之称。在曹子建集中就可以找出“亚岁”二字，证明在汉末时就有此名字了。孝经援神契上说：“冬至阳气萠，收莒芋，获豆稻，无空日，无游手。”这大约是指南方一带气候比较暖和的地方，有人在冬至这天选择谷种，用谷种各一升，分盛在布囊内埋在北墙阴下，冬至后五十日，取其发芽最多的作为来年的种子。还有的说在冬至这天早晨用糟水浇海棠花根，明年花就分外鲜明。
