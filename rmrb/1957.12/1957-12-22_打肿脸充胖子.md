    To Put on a Bold Face
    "The U.S. Army successfully launched its 'powerful Jupiter' intermediate-range ballistic missile on Wednesday night, spectacularly demonstrating the power of the rocket," the Associated Press reported on December 19.
    How was the power of the rocket "spectacularly" demonstrated? The Pentagon admitted: "The missile did not complete its entire flight path due to technical difficulties."
    This brings to mind another example. On December 17, the Pentagon announced the "successful" test launch of the "Atlas" intercontinental missile. However, it did not explain why a rocket with a test range of five thousand miles only flew "hundreds of miles" before landing in a "selected area."
    Dr. Hagen, the head of the "Vanguard" program, may now have some regrets. He could have announced: "The satellite launch was successful. Due to technical difficulties, the 'Vanguard' rocket did not complete its entire flight path. The rocket flew a few feet before landing in the designated area."

    打肿脸充胖子
    “美国陆军于星期三晚上成功地发射了它的‘威力强大的丘辟特’中程弹道导弹，蔚为奇观地表现了火箭的力量。”“美联社”在12月19日发出的一则新闻里如是说。
    火箭的力量怎样“蔚为奇观”呢？五角大楼承认：“这枚导弹并没有完成它全部的飞行行程，因为技术上有困难。”
    人们因此想起另外一个例子。12月17日，五角大楼宣布“阿特拉斯”洲际导弹试验发射“成功”。可是它没有说明，为什么试验射程应该是五千英里的火箭，只让它飞了“数百英里”，就落在“选定的地区”了。
    “先锋号”计划的负责人哈根博士也许现在有些后悔。他当初满可以这样宣布：“人造卫星发射成功。因为技术上有困难，‘先锋号’火箭并没有完成它的全部行程。火箭飞了数英尺就落在预定地区。”
