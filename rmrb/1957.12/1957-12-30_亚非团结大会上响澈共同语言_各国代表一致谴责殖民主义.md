Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 28th: The heads of the delegations from Korea and Vietnam attending the Asian-African Solidarity Conference today both condemned the American imperialists for interfering with and obstructing the unification of their homelands. Speaking at the afternoon plenary session, which resumed at 3:30 PM, they both requested the conference to pass resolutions to promote the reunification of the northern and southern parts of their countries.

The head of the Korean delegation, Han Xueye, accused the American imperialists of keeping Korea divided for a long time and of indefinitely occupying South Korea, treating it as an American colony and a spearhead for aggression against the mainland.

Regarding the peaceful unification of Korea, Han Xueye proposed a four-point proposal, advocating that the Korean people themselves resolve the unification issue without any external pressure, that foreign troops withdraw simultaneously, that the armistice agreement be strictly implemented, and that relevant countries hold a conference.

The head of the Vietnamese delegation, Nguyen Xuan Thuy, in his speech, demanded the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords and the immediate convening of consultative conferences between the northern and southern authorities of Vietnam to discuss the holding of free general elections throughout the country to achieve the unification of Vietnam. He said that if the United States stopped interfering, all internal affairs of Vietnam could be resolved by the Vietnamese themselves through peaceful negotiations.

Dr. Boezidhes, head of the Cyprus delegation and member of the Supreme Committee of the Cyprus National Movement, demanded that all Asian and African countries adhere to the principle of self-determination for Cyprus and support the implementation of this principle. He criticized many Asian and African countries for not voting in favor of this principle at the United Nations General Assembly and requested the conference to express the hope that Cyprus should be given the opportunity to exercise self-determination to decide their future.

Representatives from African countries still under colonial rule demanded the right to self-determination in their speeches at the conference.

The head of the Chad delegation said that France divided Equatorial Africa into four parts—Chad being one of them—and forcibly set up a pseudo-government in each part, which is the old imperialist trick of "divide and rule." He also spoke of the atrocities of the French authorities, such as when France set fire to the entire city of Modo under the pretext that residents did not pay taxes.

The representative of French Somaliland also said at the conference that imperialism divided the people of Somaliland into many parts to weaken their national independence movement. He said that the people of Somaliland are fighting to end foreign rule and achieve unity. Their motto is: "Africa for Africans, Asia for Asians, and imperialism must not be allowed to intrude."

The Kenyan representative spoke at the meeting about the suffering his country has endured under British imperialist rule. This rule has deprived the Kenyan people of all rights and personal freedoms.

The chief representative of newly independent Ghana said that his country believes that the right to self-determination of every country should be respected and that human rights should be upheld.

Representatives from Middle Eastern countries condemned imperialist interference in the region.

The Kuwaiti representative said that Kuwait produces hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil, but most of its people live in extreme poverty. Kuwait, like other Arab emirates with abundant oil resources on the Persian Gulf, is suffering from imperialist exploitation. Imperialism suppresses all nationalist movements in this region. He cited the example that nationalist leaders on the island of Bahrain were arrested.

The chief representative of Iraq, former cabinet minister Mohammed Hadid, accused the Baghdad Pact of attempting to isolate Iraq among Arab countries and isolate it from the liberation movements in Asia and Africa. He said that the Iraqi people firmly oppose the Baghdad Pact.

The head of the Lebanese delegation, former Lebanese Prime Minister Hussein Oueini, said that the best and most effective way to avoid war is to condemn military treaties, because such treaties cause discord between countries. He said that the Lebanese delegation opposes foreign interference in the affairs of any Asian or African country.

The Jordanian representative, former Jordanian Minister of Education and Justice Shafiq Arshidat, said that just as it defeated British imperialism in the past, Jordan will defeat American imperialism.

The Burmese representative, Wu La Jue, said that the people of Burma requested his delegation to present to the conference a demand for the immediate end to foreign occupation in Asian and African countries, the end to foreign troops stationed and ruling in Asian and African countries, the abolition of military treaties and military bases, the end to racial discrimination, the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing and manufacturing, and support for the Algerian people's struggle for independence.

He also said that the governments of Burma, India, and China, etc., are now making progress in resolving the border issues left over from colonialism in accordance with the principles of the Bandung Conference.

The head of the Ceylon delegation expressed his belief that the moral solidarity established by this conference will weaken the foundation of imperialism, which will help the struggle of all oppressed people. He also expressed his support for cooperation among Asian and African peoples for economic and social progress.

The chief representative of Ethiopia said that the spirit of friendship generated by the Bandung Conference has had a profound impact on the international situation and has made Asian and African countries a great force in upholding the principles of freedom and sovereignty.

    亚非团结大会上响澈共同语言
    各国代表一致谴责殖民主义
    据新华社开罗28日电　出席亚非团结大会的朝鲜和越南的代表团团长今天都谴责美帝国主义者干涉和阻挠他们祖国的统一。他们在三时三十分复会的下午全体会议上发言时，都要求大会通过决议来促进他们祖国南北两部分的重新统一。
    朝鲜代表团团长韩雪野指责美帝国主义使朝鲜长期处于分裂状态，并且无限期地占领南朝鲜，把它当作美国的殖民地和侵略大陆的矛头。
    韩雪野就朝鲜的和平统一，提出了一项四点提案，主张由朝鲜人自己在不受任何外界压力的情况下解决统一问题、外国部队同时撤退、严格执行停战协定以及有关国家举行会议。
    越南代表团团长阮春水在发言中，要求彻底执行日内瓦协定和立即召开越南的南北方当局之间的协商会议，来讨论在全国范围内实行自由的大选以便实现越南的统一的问题。他说，如果美国停止干涉的话，越南的一切内部事务都可以由越南人自己通过和平谈判来解决。
    塞浦路斯代表团团长、塞浦路斯民族运动最高委员会委员波埃济德斯博士要求所有亚非国家坚持塞浦路斯自决的原则，并且支持履行这一原则。他批评许多亚非国家没有在联合国大会上投票支持这一原则，并且要求大会表示希望塞浦路斯应该得到施行自决权来决定他们的前途的机会。
    仍然在殖民统治之下的非洲各国的代表在大会上的发言中都要求有自决权。
    乍得代表团团长说，法国把赤道非洲分割为四部分——乍得即其中之一——并且在每一部分强行设置一个伪政府，这是帝国主义的“分而治之”的旧手法。他还谈到了法国当局的暴行，例如法国曾经借口摩多城居民不缴税而纵火焚烧了整座城市。
    法属索马里兰代表也在大会上说，帝国主义把索马里兰人民割裂成为许多部分，以削弱他们的民族独立运动。他说，索马里兰人民正在为结束外国的统治和实现统一而斗争。他们的座右铭是：“非洲是非洲人的非洲，亚洲是亚洲人的亚洲，决不容许帝国主义闯入。”
    怯尼亚代表在会上谈到了他的国家在英帝国主义统治下遭受的苦难。这种统治使怯尼亚人民被剥夺了一切权利和个人自由。
    新近获得独立的加纳的首席代表说，他的国家认为每个国家的自决权都应该受到尊重，并且要维护人权。
    来自中东各国的代表们谴责了帝国主义对这一地区的干涉。
    科威特代表说，科威特生产了成千上万桶石油，但是它的大部分人民却处在极端贫困的状况中。科威特和波斯湾畔拥有丰富石油资源的其他阿拉伯酋长国一样，正在遭受帝国主义的剥削。帝国主义镇压这个地区的一切民族主义运动。他举例说，巴林岛的民族主义领袖们被逮捕了。
    伊拉克首席代表、前内阁大臣穆罕默德·哈迪迪指责巴格达条约企图使伊拉克在阿拉伯国家中陷于孤立，并且使它同亚非地区的解放运动隔绝。他说，伊拉克人民坚决反对巴格达条约。
    黎巴嫩代表团团长、前黎巴嫩总理侯赛尼·乌埃尼说，避免战争的最好和最有效的一个办法就是谴责军事条约，因为这种条约引起了各国之间的不和。他说，黎巴嫩代表团反对外国干涉任何亚非国家的事务。
    约旦代表、前约旦教育和司法大臣沙菲克·阿希达特说，就像过去打败了英帝国主义一样，约旦将击败美帝国主义。
    缅甸代表吴拉觉说，缅甸人民要求他的代表团向大会提出，要求立刻结束在亚非国家的外国占领、结束在亚非国家驻扎外国军队和进行统治，废除军事条约和军事基地，结束种族歧视，禁止核武器的试验和制造，支持阿尔及利亚人民要求独立的斗争。
    他还说，缅甸、印度和中国等国的政府按照万隆会议的原则，在解决殖民主义所遗留下来的边界问题方面现在正取得进展。
    锡兰代表团团长表示相信，这次大会所建立的道义上的团结将削弱帝国主义的基础，这将有助于一切被压迫人民的斗争。他还表示赞成亚非人民为了经济和社会的进步而进行合作。
    埃塞俄比亚首席代表说，万隆会议所产生的友好精神对国际局势发生了深刻的影响，并且使亚非国家成为一种维护自由和主权原则的巨大力量。
