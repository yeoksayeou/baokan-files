    State Council Organs Actively Eliminate the Four Pests and Emphasize Hygiene
    Premier Zhou Instructs that the Movement Should Be Regularized
    (Our dispatch) State Council organs, in accordance with Beijing's unified plan, are actively carrying out the "Eliminate the Four Pests, Emphasize Hygiene" movement. Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council also attaches great importance to this movement, personally urging and proposing to the organs' cadres the requirement that "the movement must be regularized."
    The State Council's hygiene work, generally speaking, has been done well in the past few years. Since 1952, the机关 Patriotic Hygiene Movement Committee [State Council Patriotic Hygiene Movement Committee] was established. It is currently led by a responsible comrade from the General Office of the State Council. Each unit has also established branches (now the organs' hygiene work groups). These hygiene organizations are relatively sound and have played a significant role in the organs' hygiene work.
    After the launch of Beijing's winter "Eliminate the Four Pests, Emphasize Hygiene" movement, the State Council Patriotic Hygiene Movement Committee formulated a new plan based on the specific circumstances of the organs.
    On the 12th, Qi Yanming, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council, gave a mobilization report to all cadres. He requested that Party, League, and administrative responsible comrades attach importance to hygiene work and earnestly inspect and supervise the hygiene work of their subordinate units. In order to maintain the regularization of the movement, each unit should formulate hygiene systems and hygiene covenants according to its specific circumstances.
    Now, the entire organ has actively taken action. In terms of organization, in addition to strengthening and improving existing organizations, hygiene shock brigades have also been established at the division and office levels. From the 14th to the 21st, each unit successively carried out a major clean-up, vigorously eliminating overwintering mosquitoes and flies.

    国务院机关积极除四害讲卫生
    周总理指示要使运动经常化
    本报讯　国务院机关遵照北京市统一布置积极开展“除四害、讲卫生”运动。国务院总理周恩来对这一运动也极重视，亲自督促并向机关干部提出“一定要使运动经常化”的要求。
    国务院的卫生工作，过去几年，一般说，是作得不错的。从1952年起，就成立了机关爱国卫生运动委员会。现由国务院秘书厅的一位负责同志领导。各单位还分别成立了分会（现在是机关卫生工作组）。这些卫生组织是比较健全的，对机关的卫生工作起了很大的作用。
    北京市的冬季“除四害、讲卫生”运动开展后，国务院机关的爱国卫生运动委员会又根据机关具体情况订出新的计划。
    12日，国务院副秘书长齐燕铭对全体干部作了动员报告。他要求党、团、行政负责同志要重视卫生工作，对所属单位的卫生工作要认真地检查、督促。为保持运动经常化，每个单位要根据具体情况，订出卫生制度、卫生公约。
    现在，整个机关都已积极行动起来。在机构方面，除加强和健全已有组织外，还以处、室为单位成立了卫生突击队。从14日到21日各单位都先后进行了一次大扫除，大力消灭过冬蚊蝇。
