　　Curbing the Trend of Reckless Spending
　　Wang Jinsheng
    As the end of the year approaches, some units, seeing that they have surplus funds this year, are starting to rush to spend money, spending even money that shouldn't be spent. For example, the Chongqing Electricity Bureau, seeing that it has a surplus of budgeted funds this year, is preparing to count the housing construction completed with self-raised funds as a national budget allocation. The Hangzhou Oil Refinery has transferred the funds remaining from incomplete investments this year to advance payment for ordered goods. Some units also falsely report project progress to fraudulently obtain project payments or modify basic construction plans, listing equipment that needs to be installed as equipment that does not need to be installed, and including it in the completed investment plan.
    Some construction units also use surplus funds to purchase furniture and appliances. For example, the Sichuan Geological Bureau used 31,500 yuan of this year's surplus funds to purchase 30 cameras and 30 pairs of binoculars that were not urgently needed, and also planned to buy electric fans, safes, etc. The Chongqing Petroleum School plans to use surplus funds to add clothes racks to student dormitories. One company's police brigade, with only 185 people, bought 264 sets of raincoats. One unit under this company has a staff quota of 250 people, and already has more than enough tables and chairs, but still bought six writing desks, eight leather chairs, and twenty-three office desks.
    Another manifestation of waste in basic construction units is the excessive and premature procurement of equipment and materials, occupying a large amount of national funds. For example, the state stipulates that the equipment reserve period is about four months, but some departments reserve it for a year or even several years.
    Rushing to spend money and waste are not only violations of the national financial system, but also violations of the principle of building the country and running enterprises diligently and thriftily. Rushing to spend money and waste during the rectification movement is even more inappropriate. We hope that state organs, institutions, and enterprises will, during the rectification movement, examine and correct the shortcomings of rushing to spend money and extravagance and waste, conscientiously implement the State Council's "Instructions on Further Developing the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement," and conscientiously implement the Party's proposed policy of building the country and running enterprises diligently and thriftily.

　　制止抢花钱之风
　　王金生
    现在又将近年终了，有些单位看到今年资金有多余，开始抢着花钱，把不该花的钱也花了。如重庆电业局看到今年预算资金有结余，就准备把用自筹资金完成的房屋建筑算作国家预算拨款。杭州炼油厂将今年完不成投资所剩下的资金转作预付订货款支出去了。也有的单位用虚报工程进度办法冒领工程价款或修改基本建设计划，把需要安装的设备改为不需要安装的设备，列入完成投资计划。
    有的建设单位还以多余资金购买家具器具。如四川地质局以今年多余资金三万一千五百元购买并不十分需要的照像机和望远镜各三十架，还准备再买电风扇、保险箱等。重庆石油学校拟用多余资金添置学生宿舍衣架。有一个公司的警察大队只有一百八十五人，却买了二百六十四套雨衣。这个公司所属的一个单位人员定额是二百五十人，已有的桌凳用不完，又买六张写字台，八把皮椅，二十三张办公桌。
    基本建设单位浪费的另一种表现，是过多过早地采购器材设备，占用国家大量资金。如国家规定设备储备期为四个月左右，但有些部门却储备一年甚至几年以上。
    抢花钱和浪费，不仅违反国家财政制度，而且违反勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的方针。在整风运动中抢花钱，浪费，更不应该。我们希望国家机关、事业和企业单位，在整风运动中，检查和纠正抢花钱和铺张浪费的缺点，认真贯彻国务院“关于进一步开展增产节约运动”的指示，认真贯彻党提出勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的方针。
