Ceylon Independent Commercial and Industrial Workers' Union Representative
Jajawardene's Speech

Dear brothers and sisters,

    I am very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in your discussions with you. I am very happy that several trade union workers from our country have been invited to attend this conference. Like China, Ceylon is an Asian country. Although we are far apart, we have many things in common and many connections with each other. I believe I will be able to learn a lot from this conference. Exchanging views with trade union leaders from China and other countries attending the conference will give me even more. I look forward to their assistance.

    Dear brothers and sisters, I belong to the trade union federation of the Ceylon Freedom Party led by the Prime Minister. Compared with other trade union federations in our country, our trade union is still very young. We ourselves are not yet mature in trade union work. However, what makes us proud is that our future is correct.

    I believe our future is correct. This does not mean that we do not need to learn anything. On the contrary, we still have much to learn about the strategies, theories, and practices of the trade union movement in people's democratic countries. In order to unite the working class of our country and guide them towards socialism, we still lack the experience and theoretical knowledge we need. If I can learn these things during my stay in China, then I will feel very fortunate. I appeal to all of you representatives, hoping that you will help me acquire this knowledge.

    When I left Ceylon, government-employed workers launched a wave of strikes. In all cases, the workers accepted the guarantees given by the Prime Minister and hoped that their demands would be met in the near future.

    Dear brothers and sisters, I am willing to present a major shortcoming in our trade union movement to you and seek your opinions in order to correct it. In our country, a large proportion of local workers are employed by the state and cooperatives. These workers have not fully realized that they must be responsible for the safety of property and work conscientiously. I would like to know how these problems are solved in China. I would also like to know what steps have been taken in China to merge all trade unions into a single general trade union. This knowledge will be of great help to us in the next three years.

    More and more local workers are joining trade unions. Unless we cultivate thousands of trade union cadres, it will be difficult to cope with these increased tasks. I would be very grateful if you could tell me how you solved this problem in the form of a report. I would be especially grateful if you could give me a trade union curriculum outline from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions cadre school.

    These are just a small part of our problems, we have many more. We hope to get opinions and guidance on solving these problems.

    The victory of the Chinese working people has always been a source of great strength that inspires us. In recent years, our two countries have become closer. The fraternal invitations sent to Ceylon's trade unions have facilitated the arrival of representatives of our country's working class in China, and learning many valuable experiences in the trade union movement. On behalf of my trade union federation, I thank you.

    I am pleased to announce that we have reorganized the Independent Commercial and Industrial Workers' Union into the Ceylon National Trade Union Federation, which includes ten trade unions.

    Long live the friendship between the working classes of China and Ceylon!

    Long live the friendship of the working people of all countries!

    Long live world peace!

### 锡兰独立工商工人工会代表  贾雅瓦顿尼致词

    锡兰独立工商工人工会代表
    贾雅瓦顿尼致词亲爱的兄弟姐妹们：
    我能有机会和你们一道参加你们的讨论，我感到十分愉快。我很高兴，我国有好多位工会工作者被邀请参加了这次大会。同中国一样，锡兰是一个亚洲国家。虽然我们相隔很远，但我们彼此之间却有着许多共同点和许多联系。我相信我将能够从这次大会学习到许多东西。同出席大会的中国和其他国家的工会领袖们交换意见，将使我得到更多的东西。我期待他们的协助。
    亲爱的兄弟姐妹们，我属于总理领导的党——锡兰自由党的工会联合会。和我国的其他工会联合会比较起来，我们的工会还很年轻。我们自己在工会工作方面还没有成熟。然而，使我们感到骄傲的是：我们的前途是正确的。
    我相信我们的前途是正确的。这并不是说我们什么都不要学习了。相反的，关于人民民主国家的工会运动的策略、理论和实践方面，我们还要学习许多东西。为了要联合本国工人阶级并且引导他们走向社会主义，我们还缺乏我们需要的经验及理论知识。如果我在逗留中国期间，能学到这些东西，那末我将感到非常幸运。我向你们全体代表呼吁，希望你们协助我获得这种知识。
    当我离开锡兰时，政府雇佣的工人掀起了罢工的浪潮。在所有的事件中，工人们都接受了由总理给予的保证，并且希望他们的要求在最近将来能得到实现。
    亲爱的兄弟姐妹们，我愿意把我们工会运动中一个大缺点摆在你们面前，并且征求你们的意见，以便改正。在我们国家里，很大一部分本国工人被国家和合作社雇佣着。这些工人还没有完全认识到要对财产的安全负责，并且要认真的工作。我很想知道，在中国，这些问题是怎样解决的。我还想知道，在中国采取了什么步骤去合并所有的工会而成立一个总工会。在今后三年内，这种知识对我们有莫大的帮助。
    愈来愈多的本国工人参加了工会。除非我们培养出数以千计的工会干部，是难以应付这些增加的工作。如果能利用报告的方式告诉我，你们是怎样解决这个问题的，我将是很感谢你们的。如果你们能给我一个中华全国总工会干部学校的工会课程大纲，我将尤其感激。
    这些只是我们的问题的一小部分，我们还有更多的问题。我们希望得到解决这些问题的意见和指导。
    中国劳动人民的胜利，始终是鼓舞我们的伟大力量的泉源。近年来，我们两国更加接近了。发给锡兰各工会的兄弟般的邀请，便利了我国工人阶级的代表来到中国，并且学习在工会运动方面的许多有价值的经验。我代表我的工会联合会谢谢你们。
    我高兴地宣布，我们已经把独立工商工人工会改组成为包括十个工会的锡兰全国工会联合会。
    中锡两国的工人阶级友好万岁！
    各国劳动人民的友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
