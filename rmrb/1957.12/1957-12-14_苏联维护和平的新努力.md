Soviet Union's New Efforts to Maintain Peace

In recent days, the Soviet government has taken significant measures to ease international tensions and maintain world peace. On December 12th, the Soviet government sent a note to the governments of all United Nations member states regarding the resolution of major current international issues. Prior to this, the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Bulganin, wrote letters to Indian Prime Minister Nehru, US President Eisenhower, British Prime Minister Macmillan, French Prime Minister Gaillard, West German Chancellor Adenauer, and the leaders of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands, and other countries, putting forward many positive and constructive suggestions for maintaining world peace.

The Soviet government's proposals mainly include: First, the major powers must abandon the use of force and the threat of force to resolve disputes, and end the arms race; the major powers should undertake the obligation not to use various nuclear weapons, and to stop all experimental explosions of nuclear weapons from January 1, 1958, for at least two or three years. Second, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization should conclude a non-aggression pact to achieve peaceful coexistence and non-interference in internal affairs between the countries of the two treaty groups. Third, the major powers should undertake the obligation not to deploy nuclear weapons in East and West Germany, and Poland and Czechoslovakia should also undertake the obligation not to produce and deploy nuclear weapons, in order to establish a vast area without atomic armaments in Europe. Fourth, in order to normalize the situation in the Middle East, the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France must undertake the obligation to strictly abide by the principle of not interfering in the internal affairs of the countries in this region and not using force in resolving issues related to the Middle East. Fifth, develop comprehensive relations between countries without hindrance. Sixth, high-level representatives of capitalist and socialist countries should hold talks.

This series of actions by the Soviet government powerfully demonstrates the Soviet government's lofty desire and initiative in maintaining peace. This Soviet effort to maintain peace fully conforms to the common will of the declaration of the twelve socialist countries' communist and workers' parties and the declaration of the sixty-four communist and workers' parties not long ago, and is a major step taken to realize the sincere desire expressed in these two declarations to "give peace to the world." It will undoubtedly be warmly welcomed by the people of all countries.

In the past few months, the US ruling clique has used the latest scientific achievements of the Soviet Union in launching artificial earth satellites as an excuse to intensify its arms expansion and war preparations. Under this pretext, the US ruling clique has, on the one hand, put forward the slogan "More cannons, less butter" domestically to accelerate the implementation of a frenzied arms race plan; on the other hand, it is exerting every pressure to establish US missile bases on the territories of the Western European countries of the North Atlantic Group, and turn these countries into warehouses for storing US nuclear weapons. The upcoming summit of the North Atlantic Group countries is a meeting where the United States is forcing Western European countries to step up their preparations for war. This cannot but make the situation in Europe and the entire international situation tense, and it cannot but make the people of Western European countries and other countries feel uneasy.

The success of the Soviet Union in launching artificial earth satellites shows that the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in the development of important departments of science and technology. Of course, this also shows that the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in the development of military technology. However, the Soviet Union is a socialist country. It does not need war, nor does it need to invade any country; in its foreign relations, it unswervingly pursues a policy of peaceful coexistence with countries with different social systems. Therefore, whether in the past or now, the Soviet Union opposes the use of nuclear weapons and rocket weapons as a means of war, and advocates reaching international agreements to ban their use, so that this scientific achievement of mankind can be entirely used for peace. For many years, the Soviet Union has made unremitting efforts to achieve comprehensive disarmament. However, the imperialist countries, headed by the United States, have repeatedly rejected the Soviet Union's repeated proposals, so that the protracted disarmament negotiations have not yet reached any agreement.

Now, the world is facing such a serious choice: either stop the arms race, implement comprehensive disarmament, and achieve peaceful coexistence, or the whole world may be plunged into enormous destruction when the US aggression group launches a nuclear war. Because the development of military technology, especially the emergence of intercontinental ballistic missiles, has made it impossible for any country that attempts to launch a war to escape the retaliatory strike of destructive weapons. No place on earth can avoid the attack of long-range missiles. Once a war breaks out, it will inevitably lead to a global nuclear weapons war, which will bring mankind a more devastating disaster than any war in past history. Precisely for this reason, the voices of people of all countries demanding to stop the war and maintain peace have become louder and greater than at any time in the past. The Soviet government, at a time when the US ruling clique is trying its best to step up the arms race and is attempting to force other countries of the North Atlantic Group to do the same, once again calls for an end to the "cold war," a cessation of the arms race, and the implementation of peaceful coexistence. This not only points out a way out for the current situation, but also supports the people and governments of various countries who oppose the US arms expansion and war preparations policy.

It is already very clear that the path of arms expansion and war preparations can only lead to serious and unfortunate consequences for any Western country; the only way out is to implement peaceful coexistence. Great powers have a special responsibility in promoting peaceful coexistence. Past experience has shown that direct talks between leaders of great powers have a positive effect on promoting the relaxation of the international situation and enhancing mutual trust. Peace-loving people of all countries welcome peaceful consultations between leaders of great powers, and do not want to see arms expansion and war preparation meetings like those held by the heads of state of the North Atlantic Group. The Soviet Union has expressed its willingness to agree to hold direct talks between leaders of great powers, and advocates holding talks between high-level representatives of capitalist and socialist countries, which is in line with the wishes of international public opinion.

We, the Chinese people, wholeheartedly welcome and actively support this series of proposals by the Soviet government aimed at eliminating international tensions and maintaining world peace. We believe that this effort by the Soviet government will surely be supported by peace-loving people of all countries, and will encourage them to strive with full confidence to achieve peaceful coexistence and oppose the US policy of arms expansion and war preparations.

### 苏联维护和平的新努力

　　苏联维护和平的新努力
    最近几天来，苏联政府采取了缓和国际紧张局势和维护世界和平的重大措施。苏联政府12日向联合国全体会员国政府发出了关于解决当前重大国际问题的照会。在此以前，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁分别写信给印度总理尼赫鲁、美国总统艾森豪威尔，英国首相麦克米伦、法国总理盖伊阿、西德总理阿登纳，以及比利时、荷兰等国政府的领导人，提出了许多维护世界和平的积极的建设性的建议。
    苏联政府的建议，主要是：一、大国必须放弃使用武力和以武力威胁来解决争执问题，结束军备竞赛；大国承担不使用各种核武器的义务，并且从1958年1月1日起停止各种核武器的试验性的爆炸，至少以两三年为期。二、北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约组织应当缔结一项互不侵犯协定，在两个条约集团国家之间实现和平共处和互不干涉内政。三、大国承担不在东西德境内配置核武器的义务，加上波兰和捷克斯洛伐克也承担不生产和不配置核武器的义务，以在欧洲建立一个没有原子军备的辽阔地区。四、为使中东局势正常化，苏、美、英、法四国必须承担义务，严格遵守不干涉这个地区国家的内政和解决同中东有关问题时不使用武力的原则。五、毫无阻碍地发展各国之间的全面关系。六、资本主义国家和社会主义国家的高级代表举行会谈。
    苏联政府这一系列的行动，有力地表明了苏联政府维护和平的崇高的愿望和主动精神。苏联这种维护和平的努力，完全符合不久以前十二个社会主义国家共产党和工人党的宣言和六十四个共产党和工人党的宣言的共同意志，并且是为实现这两个宣言所表达的“给世界以和平”的真诚愿望而采取的重大步骤，它无疑将受到各国人民的热烈欢迎。
    在过去几个月中，美国统治集团利用苏联发射人造地球卫星的最新科学成就，来作为它加紧扩军备战的借口。在这种借口之下，美国统治集团一方面在国内提出了“多一些大炮，少一些牛油”的口号，以加速推行疯狂的军备竞赛计划；另一方面则正使尽一切压力，要在北大西洋集团的西欧国家的领土上建立美国的导弹基地，并把这些国家变为储藏美国核武器的仓库。即将召开的北大西洋集团国家首脑会议，就是美国强迫西欧国家加紧备战的会议。这不能不使欧洲的局势和整个国际局势紧张起来，并且不能不使西欧各国以及其他国家的人民感到不安。
    苏联发射人造地球卫星的成功，表明了苏联在科学技术重要部门的发展上已走在美国的前面。当然，这同样表明了苏联在军事技术的发展上也超过了美国。但是，苏联是一个社会主义国家，它不需要战争，也不需要侵略任何国家；它在对外关系上是坚定不移地奉行着与其他社会制度不同的国家和平共处的政策。因而，苏联无论是过去和现在，都反对以核武器和火箭武器作为战争手段，而主张达成禁止使用它们的国际协议，以便使人类的这种科学成就完全为和平服务。多年以来，苏联就为实现全面裁军而作了坚持不懈的努力。但是，以美国为首的帝国主义国家，一而再、再而三地拒绝了苏联的多次建议，使旷日持久的裁军谈判直到现在依然没有达成任何协议。
    现在，全世界面临这样的严重的选择，要么停止扩军备战、实行全面裁军、实现和平共处，要么就有可能在美国侵略集团发动核武器战争的时候使全世界陷于巨大的破坏中。因为军事技术的发展，特别是洲际弹道火箭的出现，已使妄想发动战争的任何国家都不能逃脱毁灭性武器的报复打击，地球上已经没有任何一个地方可以避免远程导弹的袭击。战争一旦爆发，势必导致全球性的核武器的战争，它将为人类带来比过去历史上任何一次大战的破坏都要惨重的灾难。正因为这个缘故，各国人民要求制止战争、维护和平的呼声近来比过去任何时期都来得响亮和宏大。苏联政府在美国统治集团正竭力加紧军备竞赛，并且企图迫使北大西洋集团其他国家也这样做的时候，再一次呼吁结束“冷战”、停止军备竞赛、实行和平共处，这不但给当前的局势指出了出路，而且也是对反对美国扩军备战政策的各国人民和政府的一种支持。
    事情已经很清楚：扩军备战的道路对于任何西方国家来说，都只能造成严重的不幸的后果；出路只有实行和平共处。在促进和平共处方面，大国有着特别的责任。过去的经验证明，大国领导人的直接会谈对于促进国际局势的和缓以及增强相互之间的信任，有着积极的作用。各国爱好和平的人民欢迎大国领导人之间的和平协商，而不愿看到像北大西洋集团国家首脑所举行的扩军备战的会议。苏联表示准备同意举行大国领导人的直接会谈，并且主张资本主义国家和社会主义国家的高级代表举行会谈，这是符合于国际舆论的愿望的。
    我们中国人民衷心欢迎和积极支持苏联政府这一系列的旨在消除国际紧张局势、维护世界和平的建议。我们相信，苏联政府的这种努力，一定会得到各国爱好和平的人民的支持，并且将鼓舞他们信心百倍地为实现和平共处和反对美国的扩军备战政策而努力。
