Smash Xu Maoyong's Conspiracy to Confuse Class Boundaries
吴传启

Xu Maoyong is a rightist element within the Party. During the period when the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism, he acted in collusion with them from within. During this period, he used over 200,000 words of essays as "daggers" and "spears" to attack the Party, comprehensively slandering and attacking the socialist revolution led by the Party. Because he had refused ideological remolding for a long time since joining the Party, and repeatedly refused to change, he finally degenerated into a bourgeois rightist. Because of his own reactionary stance, he openly promoted traitorous ideas, sympathized with those who wavered and betrayed the Party, saying that even if they betrayed, they could still be "respected," that betrayal was "happiness" and "glory," and so on.

In the wave of attacks by the bourgeois rightists, Xu Maoyong, acting as an internal accomplice, adopted the tactic of opposing the Party and socialism under the guise of opposing dogmatism, sectarianism, and bureaucratism; using distorted Marxism to oppose Marxism; exaggerating individual and one-sided phenomena to attack the revolution itself, and so on. In a secret letter, Xu Maoyong wrote to his small clique members: "The environment is dark, the current situation is difficult, where is the truth? Pursuit!" What Xu Maoyong opposed, of course, was the "difficult" current situation and the "dark" environment he perceived. Then, what was he "pursuing"?

Lenin once said that socialism is the elimination of classes. And the elimination of classes must go through class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat; without the dictatorship of the proletariat led by the Party, there is no socialism. Therefore Lenin said: "Only he is a Marxist who extends the recognition of the class struggle to the recognition of the dictatorship of the proletariat." ("State and Revolution") Lenin also believed that this was the most profound difference between Marxists and vulgar petty-bourgeois and large bourgeois. But Xu Maoyong, in the large amount of poison he spread, showed a completely opposite position on this most fundamental point. His goal was to use the method of confusing class boundaries to abolish class struggle, until he opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat led by the Party, in order to pave the way for the restoration of capitalism. This is also what Xu Maoyong was "pursuing."

I

Opposing the Marxist method of class analysis, confusing class boundaries to abolish class struggle, and opposing the dictatorship of the proletariat can be said to be one of the common methods of attack used by the rightists. Many rightist elements openly and directly declared: "The method of class analysis is outdated." One of Xu Maoyong's characteristics is to oppose Marxism by distorting Marxism, and to abolish Marxist class analysis by distorting the basic principles of Marxism.

As early as 1845, Engels wrote: "Communism is not merely a doctrine of the working class party, but a theory whose ultimate goal is to liberate the entire society, including the capitalists, from the narrow confines of existing relations." ("The Condition of the Working Class in England") However, Engels later corrected his former argument and stated that this assertion was "useless" in practice, "even mostly harmful"; because "the propertied classes not only do not feel any need for liberation themselves, but oppose the self-liberation of the working class with all their might." Engels further warned that "there are still many people today who, from a seemingly impartial point of view, advocate to the workers a socialism that transcends all class antagonisms and class struggles. If these people are not fledgling youths who still need to learn a lot, they are the most vicious enemies of the working class—wolves in sheep's clothing." (Ibid.)

But Xu Maoyong ignored Engels' warning and maliciously seized on a sentence that Engels had once corrected, and distorted the Party's policy of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, proclaiming to people: "In China, Engels's argument has been combined with the actual situation by the Chinese Communist Party and has become a concrete truth in practice" ("An Example of Linking Theory with Practice"). Starting from this anti-Marxist thesis, Xu Maoyong further proclaimed in other articles: "The Chinese bourgeoisie not only no longer resists the liberation of the working class, but also feels that it needs to be liberated from capitalist relations of production"; he believes that the bourgeoisie "is striving to become the working class," and that communism in China today has truly become "according to its principles" a doctrine "beyond the antagonism between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat." Xu Maoyong used this method to turn communism into something that transcends classes, something that is shared by both the bourgeoisie and the proletariat; in his own words, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat have become "the same in supporting socialism" ("Same and Different"). Thus, Xu Maoyong reached the same conclusion as other rightist elements: "Class boundaries no longer exist," "the method of class analysis is outdated."

Since Xu Maoyong believes that the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are both "supporting socialism" in the same way, then in his view, "fixed interest" is certainly not exploitation, "but a payment in installments for the 'redemption' of the means of production obtained by the capitalists through exploitation in the past." Conversely, for those who adhere to the class analysis viewpoint, he slanders them as "sectarianism" that "only sees differences and does not see similarities," as "fake foreign devils" who "do not allow" Ah Q to "revolt," and so on. Thus, Xu Maoyong, together with Zhang Naiqi, sang a duet on fallacies such as "the bourgeoisie has no two-sidedness," "red capitalists," and "fixed interest is not exploitation."

In order to further oppose the Marxist class viewpoint, Xu Maoyong put forward his own so-called "equality" theory. According to his saying, "Truth has always been equal to all people," "Truth for individuals does not only check class composition," and "regardless of propertied, proletarian, Party member, non-Party member, senior, junior," that is, "do not affirm that he must have truth or no truth based on composition, party affiliation, and status" ("To Whom Does Truth Belong?"), and so on. Finally, he used the formulation of "truth belongs to the masses" to complete his "equality" theory, completely negating the Marxist class viewpoint and fundamentally confusing class boundaries. In this way, of course, there is no such thing as eliminating classes, so socialist revolution and socialist transformation become superfluous. Xu Maoyong's basic reactionary position lies here.

Not only that, but his reactionary position also permeates the philosophical aspect, confusing the boundary between materialism and idealism, in order to oppose the Party spirit principle of Marxist philosophy. He used some anti-Marxist remarks in society to describe the relationship between materialism and idealism as a relationship of teacher and student, and elaborated on it. Xu Maoyong believes that materialists and idealists "have something in common" on many issues, and "on practical political issues," they "also have a common stance" ("The Relationship Between Enemies and Friends"). It should be said that Xu Maoyong's position is truly carried through to the end; from a non-class viewpoint in politics to a non-Party-spirit line in philosophy. But Xu Maoyong used the bourgeoisie's lack of Party spirit to sharply attack the Party spirit and class nature of Marxism.

Lenin said that non-Party spirit itself is a manifestation of Party spirit, a manifestation of bourgeois Party spirit. And Xu Maoyong's opposition to Marxist class analysis, his confusion of class boundaries, his confusion of the boundaries between socialism and capitalism, and his confusion of the boundaries between materialism and idealism, precisely manifested his idealistic anti-scientific Party spirit, and manifested the bourgeois rightists' anti-socialist Party spirit.

Precisely because of this, while he was confusing class boundaries, he tried his best to uglify the Communist Party and the proletariat, and to beautify the bourgeoisie; to uglify socialism, and to beautify capitalism; to uglify materialists, and to beautify idealists. He used the method of reversing black and white, befriending those he should, hating those he should, praising this while suppressing that; for Xu Maoyong, the boundaries were clear, and the stance was distinct. It can be said that his bourgeois rightist Party spirit was both strong and thorough.

II

While opposing Marxist class analysis and confusing class boundaries, Xu Maoyong brought out the bourgeois "theory of human nature" to replace the proletariat's view of class struggle; using historical idealism to replace historical materialism, in order to oppose the proletariat's class struggle. This reactionary "theory of human nature" viewpoint can be said to have been thoroughly elaborated in his many articles.

Like Xu Maoyong's other ways of opposing Marxism by distorting Marxism, he also used the same method when he brought out the "theory of human nature." Chairman Mao once wrote in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "Is there such a thing as human nature? Of course, there is. But there is only concrete human nature, there is no abstract human nature. In class society, there is only human nature with class nature, and there is no super-class human nature." That is to say, in class society, there is only human nature with class nature, and there is no so-called common human nature that transcends classes. But Xu Maoyong openly quoted this passage and distorted it, and then moved to a completely opposite position. He said: "The fact that mankind has a common general human nature, just as it also has a common biological nature with other organisms, cannot be denied" ("Outdated Commemoration").

Like many rightist elements, Xu Maoyong also used "common human nature" to oppose class nature, and used "human nature" to replace and oppose class nature. Many rightist elements slandered Communists as "having Party spirit but no human nature," while Xu Maoyong slandered those who did not recognize "common human nature" as "hypocritical." According to him, the reason why bourgeois elements can be transformed into laborers under the socialist system is because they have a "foundation of common human nature." In this way, the transformation of the bourgeoisie does not require "rebirth," and class struggle becomes superfluous. The key to the problem lies only in promoting the so-called "foundation of common human nature." This kind of argument is certainly not a novelty, but the new significance of its "revival" today lies in the fact that it is intended to use the so-called "common general human nature" to oppose the proletariat's class struggle theory.

However, Xu Maoyong's use of "the theory of human nature" to oppose class struggle is itself a kind of class struggle, a class struggle of the bourgeois rightists attacking the proletariat. Starting from his "human nature" position, Xu Maoyong launched a vicious attack on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement: he slandered the movement as "judging and reacting" from "evidence" that was "caught wind and shadows," just like "cats eating mice," "without any reason"; he slandered the great victory of the movement as "the victory of the executioners." For us, the movement was a serious class struggle, and what was placed before every counter-revolutionary element was ironclad evidence. Xu Maoyong opposed this kind of class struggle, and his various vicious slanders of the movement were nothing more than a most acute class struggle against us from a counter-revolutionary standpoint.

III

Xu Maoyong advocated bourgeois concepts of democracy and freedom in order to oppose socialist democracy and the dictatorship of the proletariat. In theory, he used the "theory of human nature" to blur class boundaries; in politics, he used bourgeois concepts of democracy and freedom to confuse the relationship between ourselves and the enemy, thereby transforming contradictions among the people into contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, and inciting "great democracy" to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat led by the Party.

Marxism believes that democracy and freedom both have a class nature; for class struggle, democracy is relative to dictatorship, the dictatorship of the proletariat is the guarantee of socialist democracy, and socialist democracy is the foundation of the dictatorship of the proletariat. But Xu Maoyong thoroughly confused this issue. He said, "As long as we talk about democracy, anything like 'inside' and 'outside,' 'above' and 'below' is no longer a problem. In fact, 'inside' and 'outside' are not the problem, the problem is 'above'." That is to say, the democracy he was "pursuing" was a democracy that did not talk about "inside" and "outside" and did not distinguish between "enemy and ourselves," a super-class democracy; of course, it was a kind of "democracy" that did not want the dictatorship of the proletariat. Taking bourgeois democracy as "democracy" and socialist democracy as "undemocratic"; taking capitalism as "brightness" and socialism as "darkness"—this was Xu Maoyong's position.

But our country has socialist democracy, not the freedom to take the capitalist road, which is no wonder it aroused Xu Maoyong's hatred. He slandered our society as an "undemocratic" "dark" world, and compared it to "the cold winter months," which made him feel a "bone-chilling" cold like the "northwest wind."

Our country is a country led by the working class (through the Communist Party) and based on the worker-peasant alliance, which is written in our Constitution. But Xu Maoyong said, "The foundation of the Party and the country...is Marxism, is truth, and is also democracy" ("Don't Be Afraid of Democracy"). He juxtaposed "Marxism," "truth," and "democracy," and collectively used them as the so-called "foundation of the Party and the country"; he used this method to confuse the class boundaries of democracy, and used it to oppose the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. Then he further declared, "Whether the contradictions among the people are handled correctly or not, and whether they will be transformed into antagonistic contradictions, is determined by whether it is democratic or not" ("Don't Be Afraid of Democracy"). In this way, the contradiction between ourselves and the bourgeois rightists is due to "lack of democracy," not due to the rightists' frenzied attacks. Xu Maoyong used this tactic to turn the contradiction between ourselves and the enemy into a contradiction among the people on the one hand, and to try to turn the contradiction among the people into a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy on the other hand; he called on people to fight against the Party with the spirit of "sacrificing one's life for righteousness."

In his many articles, Xu Maoyong slandered our society for "not enough democracy" and "too little democracy," and so on. He demanded more "personal freedom" and promoted freedom that was anti-discipline; he slandered democracy under centralized guidance as "following" without "thinking." Naturally, in our society, there can be no place for bourgeois democracy, and there can be no freedom to take the capitalist road. But the vast majority of our people enjoy democracy, so our society is precisely the most democratic society in history.

In short, in the wave of attacks by the bourgeois rightists, Xu Maoyong, acting as an internal accomplice, directed his spearhead at the Party, and his "dagger" was thrown at socialism. The aspects he attacked were very broad, and what he focused on attacking was from the proletariat's class viewpoint all the way to the dictatorship of the proletariat led by the Party.

    粉碎徐懋庸企图混淆阶级界线的阴谋
    吴传启
    徐懋庸是党内的右派分子，他在资产阶级右派向党向社会主义举行猖狂进攻的时候，实行了内应外合。在这个期间，他用二十多万字的杂文，作为向党进攻的“匕首”和“投枪”，对党所领导的社会主义革命事业进行了全面的污蔑和攻击。由于他入党以来，长期不接受思想改造，屡教不改，所以他终于堕落为资产阶级右派。由于他自己的这种反动立场，所以他公开宣扬叛徒思想，对动摇叛党的分子寄与同情，说他们虽然叛变也还是可以“尊重”的，叛变是“幸福”和“光荣”等等。
    在资产阶级右派进攻的浪潮中，作为内应的徐懋庸，他所采取的手法就是：以反对教条主义、宗派主义和官僚主义为幌子，来反党反社会主义；用歪曲马克思主义的方法，来反对马克思主义；把个别的片面现象夸大，以攻击革命本身等等。徐懋庸在一封密信中，对他的小集团分子写道：“环境黑暗，现状困难，不知真理在那里？追求！”徐懋庸所反对的，当然是他所认为的“困难”的现状和“黑暗”的环境，那末他所“追求”的又是什么呢？
    列宁曾经说过，社会主义就是消灭阶级。而消灭阶级，必须经过阶级斗争和无产阶级专政；没有党所领导的无产阶级专政，就没有社会主义。所以列宁说：“只有把承认阶级斗争扩展到承认无产阶级专政的人，才是马克思主义者”（“国家与革命”）。列宁并认为，这就是马克思主义者同庸俗小资产者和大资产者之间的最深刻的区别。而徐懋庸在他所散播的大量毒素中，就在这个最根本之点上，表现了完全相反的立场。他的目标是：用混淆阶级界线的办法来取消阶级斗争，直到反对党所领导的无产阶级专政，以便为资本主义的复辟开辟道路。这也就是徐懋庸的“追求”。
    一
    反对马克思主义的阶级分析方法，混淆阶级界线，以取消阶级斗争，反对无产阶级专政，可以说是右派进攻的共同方式之一。许多右派分子公开直接地宣称：“阶级分析的方法过时了”。徐懋庸的特点之一，就是用歪曲马克思主义的方法来反对马克思主义，用曲解马克思主义的基本原理的方法来取消马克思主义的阶级分析。
    恩格斯远在1845年就曾经写道：“共产主义不纯粹是工人阶级的党的学说，而且是一种理论，其最终目的就是把连同资本家在内的整个社会从现存关系的狭窄的范围中解放出来。”（“英国工人阶级状况”）可是后来恩格斯对他从前的论点作了更正，并声明说，这个论断在实践上是“无益的”，“甚至多半是有害的”；因为“有产阶级不但自己不感到有任何解放的需要，而且以全力反对工人阶级的自我解放”。恩格斯并进一步提出警告说，“现在也还有不少的人，以一种似乎是不偏不倚的观点向工人鼓吹一种凌驾于一切阶级对立和阶级斗争之上的社会主义。这些人如果不是还需要多多学习的初出茅庐的小伙子，就是工人阶级的最凶恶的敌人——披着羊皮的豺狼。”（同上）
    但是徐懋庸不顾恩格斯的警告，竟恶意地抓住恩格斯曾经更正过的一句话，并歪曲党对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造的政策，向人们宣称：“在中国，恩格斯的那一个论断，却被中国共产党同实际情况结合起来，在实践中成了具体真理了”（“理论联系实际的一例”）。徐懋庸从这个反马克思主义的论断出发，在其他的一些文章中进一步宣称：“中国的资产阶级，非但不再反抗工人阶级的解放，而且也感到自己有从资本主义生产关系中解放出来的需要了”；他认为资产阶级“争取变成工人阶级了”，共产主义在今天的中国，真正成了“按其原则说来”是“超乎资产阶级和无产阶级之间的敌对”的学说了。徐懋庸就是用这个办法，把共产主义变成了超阶级的东西，变成了为资产阶级和无产阶级所共有的东西；用他自己的话说，资产阶级和无产阶级之间，就成了“都拥护社会主义的同”（“同与异”）了。于是，徐懋庸就达到了同其他右派分子一样的结论：“阶级界线已经不存在了”，“阶级分析方法过时了”。
    徐懋庸既然认为资产阶级和无产阶级都是一样“拥护社会主义的”，所以在他看来，
  “定息”当然就不是剥削，“不过是对资本家过去剥削所得的生产资料的‘赎买’的分期付款”。反过来说，对于坚持阶级分析观点的人，他就污蔑为是“只见异而不见同”的“宗派主义”，是“假洋鬼子”“不准”阿Q“革命”等等。于是，徐懋庸同章乃器，就在所谓“资产阶级没有两面性”、“红色资产阶级”和“定息不是剥削”等等谬论上合唱双簧了。
    徐懋庸为了进一步反对马克思主义的阶级观点，又提出了他自己的所谓“一视同仁”论。照他的说法，“真理从来对一切人是一视同仁的”，“真理对个人，是不光查阶级成分的”，而且“不管有产、无产、党员、非党员，前辈、后学”，即“不要根据成分、党派和地位，肯定他一定有真理或无真理”（“真理归于谁家”）等等。最后，他用所谓“真理归于大众”的提法，来完成他的“一视同仁”论，彻底否定了马克思主义的阶级观点，从根本上混淆了阶级界线。这样，当然就无所谓消灭阶级，于是社会主义革命和社会主义改造就成为多余的了。徐懋庸的基本的反动立场就在此。
  　不仅如此，他的这种反动立场，还贯彻到哲学方面，混淆唯物主义同唯心主义之间的界线，以反对马克思主义哲学的党性原则。他使用社会上某些反马克思主义的言论，把唯物主义同唯心主义之间的关系说成是师生朋友关系，并加以发挥。徐懋庸认为，唯物主义者同唯心主义者在许多问题上“是共同的”，并且“在实际的政治问题上”，“也是有共同的立场”（“敌与友的关系”）。应该说，徐懋庸的立场真是贯彻到底的了；从政治上的非阶级观点，一直到哲学上的无党性路线。但是徐懋庸是以资产阶级的无党性，来尖锐地攻击马克思主义的党性和阶级性的。
    列宁说过，无党性本身，也就是一种党性的表现，是资产阶级的党性的表现。而徐懋庸这样反对马克思主义的阶级分析，混淆阶级界线，混淆社会主义同资本主义之间的界线，以及混淆唯物主义同唯心主义之间的界线，就恰好表现了他的唯心主义的反科学的党性，表现了资产阶级右派反社会主义的党性。
    正因为是这样，所以他在混淆阶级界线的同时，就极力丑化共产党和无产阶级，美化资产阶级；丑化社会主义，美化资本主义；丑化唯物主义者，美化唯心主义者。他用颠倒黑白的办法，亲亲而仇仇，扬此而抑彼；这在徐懋庸，界线是清楚的，立场是鲜明的。可以说，他的这种资产阶级右派的党性，是既强烈、又彻底的。
    二
    徐懋庸在反对马克思主义的阶级分析、混淆阶级界线的同时，却搬出了资产阶级的“人性论”，来代替无产阶级的阶级斗争观；用历史唯心主义，来代替历史唯物主义，以反对无产阶级的阶级斗争。这种反动的“人性论”的观点，在他的许多文章里，可以说是发挥得淋漓尽致了。
    同徐懋庸以歪曲马克思主义来反马克思主义的其他方式一样，他在搬出“人性论”时也用了同样手法。毛主席在“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”曾经这样写道：“有没有人性这种东西？当然有的。但是只有具体的人性，没有抽象的人性。在阶级社会里就是只有带着阶级性的人性，而没有什么超阶级的人性。”这就是说，在阶级社会里只有带有阶级性的人性，没有什么超阶级的所谓共同的人性。而徐懋庸却公然引证这一段话而加以歪曲，然后走到完全相反的立场。他说：“人类之有共同的一般人性，正如它还有与其他生物共同的生物性一样，是不能否认的”（“过了时的纪念”）。
    同许多右派分子一样，徐懋庸也是用“共同人性”来同阶级性对立的，用“人性”来顶替和反对阶级性。许多右派分子污蔑共产党人“有党性、无人性”，而徐懋庸则污蔑不承认“共同人性”的人们为“矫情”。照他说来，资产阶级分子之所以可能改造成为社会主义制度下的劳动者，乃是由于有“共同人性的基础”。这样一来，资产阶级的改造，就不需要“脱胎换骨”，而阶级斗争也就成为多余的了，问题的关键就只是在于去发扬所谓“共同人性的基础”了。这种论调当然不是什么新鲜货色，不过，在今天他把它“复活”起来的新意义，却在于要用所谓“共同的一般人性”，来反对无产阶级的阶级斗争学说。
    然而徐懋庸用“人性论”来反对阶级斗争这个事实本身，就是一种阶级斗争，是资产阶级右派向无产阶级进攻的阶级斗争。徐懋庸从其“人性”立场出发，对肃反运动进行了恶毒的攻击：他污蔑肃反运动是“从捕风捉影的‘证据确凿’出发”而“判与反动”的，就像“猫吃老鼠”一样，“是不讲任何理由的”；他污蔑肃反运动的伟大胜利是“刽子手的胜利”。对于我们来说，肃反运动是一场严肃的阶级斗争，摆在每个反革命分子面前的是铁的实证。徐懋庸反对这种阶级斗争，他对肃反运动的种种恶毒的污蔑，只不过是站在反革命立场上对我们进行的一种最尖锐的阶级斗争。
    三
    徐懋庸宣扬资产阶级的民主自由观念，以反对社会主义民主和无产阶级专政。他在理论上，用“人性论”来模糊阶级界线；在政治上，则用资产阶级的民主自由观念，来混淆敌我关系，从而变人民内部矛盾为敌我矛盾，煽动“大民主”来反对党所领导的无产阶级专政。
    马克思主义认为，民主和自由都是有阶级性的；对于阶级斗争来说，民主是对专政而言的，无产阶级专政是社会主义民主的保证，社会主义民主是无产阶级专政的基础。而徐懋庸却在这个问题上，进行了彻头彻尾的混淆。他说，“只要讲民主，什么‘内外’‘上下’之类都不成问题了，其实‘内外’并非问题，问题是‘上’”。也就是说，他所“追求”的民主，乃是一种不讲“内外”、不分“敌我”的超阶级的民主；当然也就是不要无产阶级专政的一种“民主”了。以资产阶级民主为“民主”，以社会主义民主为“不民主”；以资本主义为“光明”，以社会主义为“黑暗”，这就是徐懋庸的立场。
    但是我们国家有社会主义的民主，没有走资本主义道路的自由，无怪乎引起了徐懋庸的憎恨。他把我们的社会污蔑为“不民主”的“黑暗”世界，并比作“寒冬腊月”，是像“西北风”一样使他感到“刺骨”的寒冷。
    我们国家是以工人阶级为领导（通过共产党）、以工农联盟为基础的国家，这是载在我们的宪法上的。但徐懋庸却说，“党、国的基础，……是马克思主义，是真理，而且也就是民主”（“不要怕民主”）。他把“马克思主义”、“真理”和“民主”并提，共同作为所谓“党、国的基础”；他就是用这样的办法来混淆民主的阶级界线，并且用以同以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政对立起来。于是他就进一步宣称，“人民内部的矛盾处理得正确不正确，会不会转化为对抗性的矛盾，是决定于民主不民主”（“不要怕民主”）。这样说来，我们同资产阶级右派之间的敌我矛盾，乃是由于“不民主”，而不是由于右派的猖狂进攻了。徐懋庸就是用这种手法，一方面把敌我矛盾说成为人民内部矛盾；另一方面又力图变人民内部矛盾为敌我矛盾；他号召人们以“杀身成仁”的精神来向党斗争。
    徐懋庸在他的许多文章里，污蔑我们社会的“民主不够”、“嫌民主少了”等等。他要求多给些“个人自由”，宣扬反纪律的自由；他把集中指导下的民主，污蔑为“随”而不“思”。自然，在我们社会里，不能有资产阶级民主的地位，不能有走资本主义道路的自由。但我们是绝大多数人享受着民主，因此我们的社会正是史无前例的最民主的社会。
    总之，在资产阶级右派进攻的浪潮中，作为内应的徐懋庸，他的矛头是对着党的，他的“匕首”是投向社会主义的。他所攻击的方面十分广泛，而他所集中攻击的，则是从无产阶级的阶级观点，一直到党所领导的无产阶级专政。
