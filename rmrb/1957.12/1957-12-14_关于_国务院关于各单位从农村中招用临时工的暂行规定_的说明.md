　　Explanation Regarding "The State Council's Provisional Regulations on the Recruitment of Temporary Workers from Rural Areas by Various Units"
　　Minister of Labor, Ma Wenrui

　　Looking at the situation in recent years, the number of temporary workers recruited by various departments of the national economy has been no less than two million person-times annually, reaching more than three million person-times in 1956, which is a considerable number. In the past, due to insufficiently strict regulations on recruitment procedures and formalities, many drawbacks arose. For example, some units had surplus personnel or other local units had surplus personnel, but when they needed temporary workers, they did not resolve the issue through adjusting from existing personnel but instead recruited from society; some units often recruited excessively, causing serious idleness, which wasted labor and state funds. The overshooting of the labor plan in 1956 was partly due to the excessive recruitment of temporary workers. Some units, when recruiting temporary workers, did not strictly adhere to the principle of prioritizing urban areas over rural areas, neglecting the surplus labor force in cities and instead recruiting from rural areas, which was detrimental to both urban labor employment and agricultural production. Particularly after the basic realization of agricultural cooperation, we failed to emphasize organized recruitment through agricultural cooperatives according to the new situation, resulting in many units still recruiting workers beyond agricultural cooperatives or arbitrarily employing farmers who blindly flowed into cities. Consequently, during recruitment, it stimulated a large influx of farmers into cities, hindering agricultural production and the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives, while during harvest and busy farming seasons, large batches of temporary workers were laid off and returned to their hometowns, affecting urban construction. To overcome these drawbacks, it is necessary to formulate regulations on recruiting temporary workers from rural areas based on the principles of considering both urban and rural areas, industry and agriculture, as well as streamlining and economizing.

　　The first article of these regulations stipulates that when various units need temporary workers, they should first resolve the issue by adjusting from the surplus personnel of their own units, and if that is not enough, they should resolve it by adjusting from the surplus personnel of other local units through the labor department according to the approved plan. Doing so is fully in line with the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift and the principle of streamlining and economizing. We should not repeat the mistakes of the past, idling surplus personnel on one hand and recruiting workers on the other, wasting manpower and financial resources. This provision will be supported by the broad masses of workers and staff. However, it should also be recognized that such adjustment work may sometimes encounter difficulties. Some employees who were not originally engaged in temporary work may have unclear understanding, ideological resistance, and be unwilling to do temporary work. For those who hold this attitude, the leaders of various units should explain to them that from the perspective of the overall interests of the people, an enterprise or institution can, in principle, dismiss surplus personnel, but now they are being retained and assigned to temporary work, still receiving wages, which is obviously a win-win situation for both the public and private sectors, and is also a form of consideration; moreover, any work is needed for the country's construction, and they should not and have no reason to disobey administrative transfer. For employees who refuse to transfer work without a legitimate reason, the administration has the right to dismiss them in order to consolidate labor discipline. Of course, when transferring surplus personnel to do other work, the leadership should pay attention to being fair and reasonable.

　　The first article of these regulations also states that the recruitment of temporary workers must prioritize urban areas over rural areas. This principle was established by the government long ago, and it is required to be strictly observed in the future. Doing so is beneficial to both industrial and agricultural production. Because farmers in rural areas can engage in agricultural and sideline production at any time, creating wealth, while the surplus labor force in cities is a waste of human resources without work. Furthermore, minimizing recruitment from rural areas is of great significance for controlling the increase in the urban population. In the past, some units only liked to recruit temporary workers from rural areas and were unwilling to recruit in cities. This incorrect thinking and practice must be corrected.

　　These regulations stipulate that the recruitment of temporary workers must be approved by the provincial, autonomous region, and directly-controlled municipality people's committees, and the local labor departments shall uniformly arrange the recruitment. The recruitment must have a letter of introduction from the local labor department, must consult with the agricultural cooperatives under the guidance of the county and township people's committees, the recruiting units must truthfully introduce the relevant situation, and a labor contract must be signed. These strict procedures and formalities are very necessary. In particular, organized recruitment through agricultural cooperatives is a new measure that must be taken based on the current new situation of agricultural development and is an important measure of the national employment system. Only in this way can loopholes be blocked, the private increase of personnel by various units be controlled, and the blind flow of farmers into cities be prevented, which is conducive to improving the planned nature of industrial and agricultural production using labor, ensuring the needs of urban construction, and helping the development of agricultural production and the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives. According to these regulations, it is strictly forbidden for various units to recruit workers privately in rural areas and to privately employ farmers who blindly flow into cities in the future. Agricultural cooperatives and rural organizations and groups shall also not privately introduce farmers to find work in cities or industrial and mining areas. If various units violate this regulation, they will be disciplined by the supervisory departments.

　　These regulations only make principled provisions for the economic relationship between agricultural cooperative members who go out to work and the cooperative. Because this is an internal matter of the agricultural cooperative, and the situation is complex, the government should not make more specific provisions. At present, there are basically two forms of economic relationship between members who go out to work and the cooperative: one is that all the income from work belongs to the individual, but they must pay public accumulation funds and public welfare funds to the cooperative according to regulations; the other is that part of the income from work belongs to the individual, and part is handed over to the cooperative, which records labor days for him according to the amount he hands over to the cooperative. No matter what form is adopted, it is important that it must be discussed democratically within the cooperative to achieve a win-win situation for both the cooperative and the members, and attention should also be paid to facilitating the enthusiasm of members who go out to work.

　　Since various units mainly recruit temporary workers from rural areas, and rarely recruit long-term workers, these regulations are mainly formulated for the issue of recruiting temporary workers from rural areas. However, the basic spirit and the principles, procedures, and formalities in the first, second, and third articles of these regulations are also fully applicable to the recruitment of long-term workers. Therefore, the fourth article stipulates that in the future, various units should also handle the recruitment of long-term workers in accordance with this.

　　关于“国务院关于各单位从农村中招用临时工的暂行规定”的说明
　　劳动部部长　马文瑞
    全国国民经济各部门招用的临时工，从近几年的情况看，每年不下二百万人次，1956年达到三百余万人次，是一个不小的数目。过去由于对招工的程序、手续规定得不够严格，产生了不少弊病。例如有些单位本来有多余人员或者当地其他单位有多余人员，需用临时工的时候不从现有人员中调剂解决而却另从社会上招用；有些单位往往过多地招用，造成严重的窝工现象，这些都浪费了劳动力和国家的资金。1956年劳动计划突破，过多地招用临时工是原因之一。有些单位在招用临时工的时候，没有严格遵守先城市后农村的原则，放着城市中的剩余劳动力不加利用而去农村招工，对于城市中安排劳动就业和农业生产，都有不利。特别是在农业合作化已经基本实现以后，我们没有能够根据新的情况，强调有组织地通过农业合作社去招工，以致不少单位仍然超越农业社招工或者任意录用盲目流入城市的农民，结果造成在招工时刺激农民大量涌入城市，妨碍农业生产和农业社的巩固，在丰收农忙时则又产生临时工成批退工回乡，影响城市建设。为了克服上述的一些弊病，就有必要根据城乡兼顾、工业和农业兼顾以及精简节约的原则，制定一个关于从农村中招收临时工的规定。
    这个规定的第一条确定，各单位在需用临时工的时候，应该首先从本单位的多余人员中调剂解决，不够的时候，应该按照批准的计划由劳动部门从当地其他单位的多余人员中调剂解决。这样做，是完全符合于勤俭建国的方针和精简节约的原则的。我们不应该再重复过去的毛病，一方面闲置着多余人员，一方面又去招工，浪费人力财力。这项规定，是会得到广大职工群众的拥护的。但是也应该看到，进行这种调剂工作，有的时候也会遇到一些困难的，某些被调动的原来不是从事临时工工作的职工，可能认识不清，思想抵触，不乐意去做临时工。对于抱有这种态度的人，各单位的领导上应该向他们说明：从人民的整体利益着眼，一个企业、机关对于多余的人员，按理是可以辞退的，现在把他们留下来，调他们做临时工的工作，照样拿工资，这显然是一件公私两利的事情，也是一种照顾；并且，任何工作都是国家建设事业所需要的，他们不应该也没有理由不服从行政上的调动。对于没有正当理由拒绝调动工作的职工，为了巩固劳动纪律，行政上有权辞退。当然，在调动多余人员做其他工作的时候，领导上应该注意做到公平合理。
    这个规定的第一条中还说到，招用临时工必须先城市后农村。这个原则本来是政府早就确定了的，今后要求严格遵守。这样做，对于工农业生产都是有利的。因为农民在农村中，任何时候都可以从事农副业生产，创造财富，而城市中的剩余劳动力没有工作，就是人力的浪费。并且，尽量少从农村中招工，对于控制城市人口的增加，也有很大意义。过去有些单位只喜欢从农村中招用临时工而不乐意在城市中招用，这种不正确的想法和作法，必须纠正。
    这个规定中规定：招用临时工必须经过省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会批准，由当地劳动部门统一布置招用，招工必须持有当地劳动部门的介绍信，必须在县、乡人民委员会的指导下向农业合作社协商招用，招工单位必须据实介绍有关的情况，必须订立劳动合同，这些严格的程序和手续，都是十分必要的。特别是通过农业社有组织地招工，这是根据目前农业发展的新情况所必须采取的新措施，是国家用人制度的一项重要措施。只有这样，才能够杜绝漏洞，控制各单位私自增加人员和防止农民盲目流入城市，有利于提高工业生产和农业生产使用劳动力的计划性，作到既保证城市建设的需要，又有助于农业生产的发展和农业社的巩固。按照这个规定，今后严格禁止各单位私自到农村招工和私自录用盲目流入城市的农民，农业社和农村中的机关、团体也不得私自介绍农民到城市或工矿区找工作。各单位如果违反这项规定，要受到监察部门的议处。
    这个规定中对于外出做工的农业社员和社的经济关系，只作了原则的规定。因为这是农业社内部的事情，并且情况复杂，政府不好作更具体的规定。现在的情况，外出做工的社员和社的经济关系，基本上有两种形式：一种是做工的收入全部归本人，但须给社按规定缴纳公积金和公益金；一种是做工的收入，部分归本人，部分交社，由社按照他交给社的款项的多少，给他记劳动日。不论采取什么形式，重要的是，必须经过社内民主讨论，作到社与社员两利，并且还应该注意到有利于发挥外出做工的社员的劳动积极性。
    由于各单位从农村中招工的时候，主要地是招用临时工，很少招用长期工，因此，这个规定主要地也是针对从农村中招用临时工这一问题而制定的。但是，这个规定的基本精神和第一、二、三项的原则、程序和手续，对于招用长期工人，也是完全适用的，因此，规定第四项确定今后各单位招用长期工人的时候，也应该照此办理。
