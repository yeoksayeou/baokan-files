　　Heilongjiang Food Industry Department
　  Goes Up Mountains, Down Rivers, and Underground to Find New Raw Materials
    (Our Dispatch) Heilongjiang Province's food industry units are doing everything possible to find various substitute raw materials to solve the problem of insufficient supply of raw materials such as grain, cooking oil, and pork.
    Brewing enterprises in Heilongjiang Province have implemented the spirit of "going up the mountains, down the rivers, and underground," organizing the masses to find various substitute materials. From the second half of last year to now, more than 6,000 tons of grass seeds, acorns, stalks, and oilseed cakes have been purchased and stored in mountainous and plain areas. Many local state-owned wineries have not experienced shutdowns this year, mainly because of the use of these substitute raw materials. The heads, roots, and peels of sugar beets, which are abundant in Heilongjiang Province, are good raw materials for brewing. This year, the Suihua County State-Owned Winery has used this raw material to brew more than 80,000 jin of wine. This wine is not only low in cost and cheap in price, but also good in color and taste.
    The mountainous forest areas of 25 counties and cities in the province produce abundant wild grapes (also known as mountain grapes). Six local state-owned wineries in Mishan, Acheng, and Ning'an all use this inexpensive mountain grape to make wine. As of now, these wineries have produced 1.5 million jin of wine. Recently, the Shangzhi County State-Owned Winery successfully trial-produced wine using tomatoes and plans to officially put it into production next year.
    Many state-owned canneries in Heilongjiang Province actively use the meat of birds and wild animals instead of pork to make canned meat. Pheasants in the Xing'anling forest area and the "Great Northern Wilderness" grassland are good raw materials for canning. Fifty tons of canned pheasant have been produced this year. Some of these canned goods are also sold abroad. Some factories have successfully trial-produced canned goods using wild boar, roe deer, and wild rabbit meat, and are also preparing to trial-produce canned goose and swan meat. The famous specialties of the Songhua River, Nen River, and Ussuri River—giant Hama fish and carp—have also been trial-produced as canned goods this year. Pickled cucumber canned goods made from dry-land cucumbers are sold to the Soviet Union and are well received.
    Many enterprises that make sweets and pastries use potatoes, sweet potatoes, and water chestnuts instead of pastry flour; and use carrots, kidney beans, jujube paste, and hawthorn as pastry fillings. When the Hailun County State-Owned Food Factory made mooncakes, it mixed in potato flour, using only 20,000 jin of flour to make more than 70,000 jin of mooncakes. The Harbin and Yibin County food factories have recently used a large amount of lecithin (a by-product of soybean oil processing) to make pastries, saving 80,000 jin of soybean oil. Food factories in Jiamusi and Hegang use soybeans, sunflower sauce, etc. to make sweets, reducing sugar consumption by about 60% compared to usual.

### 黑龙江食品工业部门  上山下水入地寻找新原料

　　黑龙江食品工业部门
　  上山下水入地寻找新原料
    本报讯　黑龙江省许多食品工业单位，千方百计地寻找各种代用原料，解决粮食、食油和猪肉等原料供应不足的问题。
    黑龙江省各酿酒企业贯彻了“上山、下水和下地”的精神，组织广大群众寻找各种代用材料。从去年下半年到现在，在山区和平原收购和储备的草籽、橡子、秸子和粕子在六千吨以上。许多地方国营酒厂今年所以没有发生停工待料的现象，主要就是因为采用了这些代用原料。黑龙江省盛产的甜菜的头、根和皮，是酿酒的较好的原料。今年绥化县国营酒厂利用这种原料，已经酿制出八万多斤酒。这种酒不仅成本低，价格便宜，成色、味道也好。
    全省二十五个县、市的山区森林地带，出产丰富的山葡萄（又称野葡萄）。密山、阿城、宁安等六个地方国营酒厂全部用这种廉价的山葡萄酿酒。截至目前，这些酒厂已经生产出一百五十万斤葡萄酒。最近，尚志县国营酒厂试用西红柿酿酒成功，计划明年正式投入生产。
    黑龙江省许多国营罐头厂积极利用飞禽、野兽的肉代替猪肉制作肉类罐头。兴安岭林区和“北大荒”草原上的野鸡是作罐头用的好原料，今年制成的野鸡罐头有五十吨。这种罐头，有一部分还运销国外。有的工厂已经利用野猪、狍子和野兔肉试制罐头成功，另外还准备试制大雁和天鹅肉罐头。松花江、嫩江和乌苏里江的名贵特产——大哈蟆鱼和鲤鱼，今年也先后被试制成罐头。用旱地黄瓜作的酸黄瓜罐头，运销苏联，受到欢迎。
    许多制作糖果糕点的企业用土豆、红薯和荸荠等代替糕点面；用胡萝卜、云豆、枣泥、山楂作糕点馅。海伦县国营食品工厂作月饼时掺用土豆粉，仅用二万斤面粉就作出了七万多斤月饼。哈尔滨和宜宾县两个食品工厂，最近大量利用磷脂（加工豆油的副产品）制作糕点，节约豆油八万斤。佳木斯、鹤岗两地食品工厂，利用黄豆、葵花酱等制作糖果，比平时减少用糖量60％左右。
