It's annoying to accidentally get your clothes dirty, especially with stains that are hard to remove with water and soap. Here are some ways to remove these stains.

	Removing Blue Ink and Rust Stains:

	If you've just gotten blue ink on your clothes, simply soak it in cold water and then apply soap to wash it away. For blue ink stains that have been there for a while, because the ferrous tannate in the ink oxidizes in the air to form insoluble ferric tannate, you need to use a diluted sodium oxalate solution to scrub it, so that the ferric tannate is reduced to ferrous tannate, and then rinse it with water or apply soap to remove it. Rust can also be removed using this method.

	Removing Red Ink Stains:

	Red ink stains can generally be washed away with warm soapy water, or a mixture of soap and ammonia. If it doesn't wash away, you can use another method: first apply a diluted potassium permanganate solution to the stain, and after a few minutes, the stain on the clothes will turn into brown manganese dioxide. Then apply a diluted sodium bisulfite solution to reduce the water-insoluble brown manganese dioxide to water-soluble manganese salts, and the stain will dissolve and be removed. The "color remover" bleaching solution sold on the market consists of a bottle of purple diluted acidic potassium permanganate solution and a bottle of diluted sodium bisulfite solution. The former is an oxidizing agent, and the latter is a reducing agent. The application method is as above.

	Removing Blood Stains:

	When you get red blood stains on your clothes, never wash them with hot water; you must use cold water. This is because the plasma and blood cells in the blood are proteins, and they will coagulate when heated, which will make them stick firmly to the clothes and be difficult to wash away. If you drip a few drops of hydrogen peroxide on it, because it releases oxygen when it encounters proteins and other organic matter, it will oxidize the organic dirt into colorless compounds, making it easier to remove the blood stain.

	Removing Ink Stains:

	Ink stains can be washed with warm soapy water. If it cannot be removed, you can use a small amount of cooked starch, such as cooked rice or sweet potatoes, and rub it vigorously, then wash it with soap to remove it. You should wash it immediately after getting ink on it. When the ink is not dry, the pine soot (black) in the ink has not completely adhered to the fine pores of the clothes' fibers. When it encounters cooked starch, it can be bonded together by the cooked starch and detached from the fibers on the clothes, removing the ink stain. If it has been there for a long time, it will take more effort to remove the ink stain because the pine soot adheres more firmly.

	Removing Fruit Juice Stains:

	Fruit juice stains can be washed with diluted ammonia first. The purpose is to neutralize the citric acid, tartaric acid, malic acid and other organic acids in the fruit juice, and then wash with soap. Tomatoes, which everyone is familiar with, contain 94% water and a small amount of carbohydrates, proteins, inorganic substances and organic acids (the main one being citric acid), so tomato stains can also be washed away using the above method. In addition, fruit juice stains can also be removed with "color remover".

	Washing Sweat Stains:

	Sweat stains on clothes can be washed away with diluted ammonia first to remove the fatty organic acids in the sweat, then washed with water, and finally washed with organic solvents such as benzene to remove the fatty substances.

### 衣服上有了斑渍能去掉吗？

　　衣服上有了斑渍能去掉吗？
    不留意把衣服弄脏了，尤其是沾染上了一些用水和肥皂很难洗去的污渍，是很恼人的事。这里介绍几种洗去这些污渍的办法。
    去蓝墨水和铁锈法：
    若是刚刚沾上蓝色墨水，只要用冷水浸一下，再打上肥皂就可以洗去。沾久的蓝色墨水，由于墨水中的鞣酸亚铁，在空气中氧化成不溶性的鞣酸铁，这时就要用稀的草酸钠溶液擦洗，使鞣酸铁还原为鞣酸亚铁，再以水冲洗或打上肥皂而除去。铁锈也可用此法洗去。
        去红墨水法：
    红色墨水迹，一般可以用温的肥皂水，或肥皂与氨水的混合液洗去。若洗不下去的时候，还可以用另一个方法：先用稀的高锰酸钾的水溶液涂在斑渍上，待数分钟，衣服上的污渍，就变成褐色的二氧化锰。然后再涂上稀的酸式亚硫酸钠水溶液，将不溶于水的褐色二氧化锰还原为可溶于水的锰盐，污渍也随着溶解而除去。市上卖的“退色灵”退色药水，就是由一瓶紫色的稀高锰酸钾酸性溶液和一瓶稀酸式亚硫酸钠水溶液组成。前者为氧化剂，后者为还原剂，应用方法如上。
        去血污法：
    当沾上红色的血渍时，千万不能用热水洗，必须用冷水洗。因为血液中的血浆和血球都是蛋白质，受热就凝固，反而牢牢地黏附在衣服上，不容易洗去。如果滴上几滴双氧水（过氧化氢），由于它和蛋白质等有机物相遇能放出氧，而将有机污物氧化成为无色的化合物，这样就容易把血渍除去。
        去墨汁渍法：
    墨汁渍可用温肥皂水洗涤。如不能除去，可以用少量的熟淀粉如蒸熟的米饭、白薯（甘薯）等物，用力搓擦，再用肥皂洗即可除去。染上墨汁后应马上就洗，乘墨汁未干时，墨汁中的松烟（黑色）还没有完全沾附在衣服的纤维细孔中，当它和熟淀粉相遇时，能被熟淀粉黏结在一起而脱离衣服上的纤维，把墨渍除去。时间久了，由于松烟沾附得较牢固，就要费一些劲才能把墨渍除去。
    去果汁渍的方法：
    果汁渍可先用稀氨水洗，目的是将果汁中的柠檬酸、酒石酸、苹果酸以及其它有机酸中和，再以肥皂洗涤。大家所熟悉的西红柿，它含有94％的水和少量的碳水化合物、蛋白质、无机物和有机酸（其中主要的为柠檬酸），因此西红柿渍也可以用上法洗去。此外，果汁渍还可以用“退色灵”除去。
        洗汗渍法：
    衣服上的汗渍，可以先用稀氨水洗去汗中的脂肪质的有机酸，再用水洗，最后用苯等有机溶剂，洗去脂肪质。
