Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th: After a mass-based rectification and improvement campaign, sixty-seven third-category agricultural cooperatives in Huaxian County, Guangdong Province, have changed their backward appearance.

Currently, these cooperatives have basically overcome the chaotic phenomena in management. Many cooperatives have recently cleared up and announced long-standing chaotic accounts. Most cooperatives have also established a set of financial systems, such as regularly announcing accounts to members. These cooperatives originally had very little public accumulation; last year, some cooperatives did not even leave any public welfare funds or public accumulation funds. This year, at the end of the year's distribution, the public accumulation funds and public welfare funds retained by each cooperative account for more than 6% of income, of which forty-nine cooperatives retained 10% to 15%. Many cooperative members who were engaged in individual production and petty trading for a long time have now changed their ways and are actively attending work to improve the collective production of the cooperative. Many households that withdrew from the cooperative have also requested to rejoin. The cadres of each cooperative who were originally detached from or rarely participated in production have generally changed their leadership style after accepting the opinions of the members. They now often participate in production and chat with members to discuss matters.

Through the socialist great debate, these third-category cooperatives first thoroughly eliminated capitalist toxins from the members' minds, and the superiority of the poor peasants within the cooperatives was re-established. On this basis, the members also put forward many opinions on improving business management, adjusting the relationship between public and private interests, and criticizing the work style of cadres.

Most of these sixty-seven cooperatives adopted the method of great debate to resolve the members' opinions. Last year, all 12,000 mu of winter crops planted by these sixty-seven cooperatives were managed by cooperative members individually. This year, more than 18,000 mu are collectively planted by the cooperative, and the members have also taken the initiative to exchange self-reserved seeds to solve the problem of seeds for more than 6,000 mu of winter-sown land. Huangling Cooperative, where no one managed field production, launched members to offer many opinions to the cooperative after criticizing capitalist spontaneous tendencies, and immediately improved eight tasks, cleaned up tens of thousands of kilograms of fertilizers exposed to sun and rain, and planted vegetables on abandoned land. Now, this cooperative has changed from a third-category cooperative to a first-category cooperative.

    抓住薄弱环节　通过辩论方法
    广东一批三类社面貌改观
    据新华社广州30日电　广东省花县六十七个三类社，经过群众性的边整边改工作以后，农业社的落后面貌已经改变过来。
    目前，这些社已基本上克服了经营管理方面的紊乱现象。许多社最近清理公布了长期混乱的账目。多数社还订出了定期向社员公布账目等一套财务制度。这些社原来很少有公共积累，去年有的社甚至没有留下一点公积金和公益金。今年年终分配，各社留的公积金、公益金都占收入6％以上，其中有四十九个社还留到10％至15％。各个社许多长期搞个人生产和做小商贩的社员，现已转变过来积极出勤，搞好社的集体生产。不少退社户也重新要求回社。各社原来脱产或很少参加生产的干部，接受社员意见后已普遍改变了领导作风。他们经常参加生产和找社员谈心、商量事情了。
    这些三类社通过社会主义大辩论，首先在社员思想上彻底清算了资本主义的毒素，社内的贫农优势重新树立起来了。在这个基础上，社员又提出了要求改进经营管理、调整公私关系及批评干部作风等方面的许多意见。
    这六十七个社解决社员的意见时，大部分采用了大辩论的方法。这六十七个社去年种的一万二千亩冬季作物全是社员个人经营的。今年一万八千多亩都由社集体种，社员们还主动换出自留种解决了六千多亩冬种地种子的困难。原来田间生产没人管理的黄岭社经过批判资本主义自发倾向后，社干部发动社员对社提了许多意见，并立即改进了八项工作，把日晒雨淋的几万斤肥料清理好，又在丢荒地种上了蔬菜。现在，这个社已从三类社变成一类社。
