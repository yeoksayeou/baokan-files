　　The vast number of workers' families, as a part of the Chinese working class, have greatly improved in terms of organization and awareness in the past few years. According to statistics from the end of 1956, among the worker's families living in concentrated areas, 11,389 family committees were established, organizing approximately 1,517,957 households, totaling 4,387,997 people; the vast majority of worker's families living in dispersed areas participated in street women's representative conferences. There were a total of 183,555 active workers' family members. The number of workers' family members participating in cultural learning increased from over 147,000 in 1952 to 540,000. Workers' families actively participated in unity and mutual aid work, with the number of participants reaching 450,000, an increase of 95.2% compared to 1954. They are thrifty in managing their households, practice the "Five Goods" (good at thrift and managing the household, good at unity and mutual aid, good at educating children, good at cleanliness and hygiene, and good at studying diligently), and strive to support the production and labor of workers, earning the respect of society.

　　职工家属逐步组织起来
    作为我国工人阶级一部分的广大职工家属，这几年在组织程度和觉悟程度方面有了很大提高。根据1956年底的统计，在集中居住的职工家属中，建立了一万一千三百八十九个家属委员会，组织起来的家属约有一百五十一万七千九百五十七户，四百三十八万七千九百九十七人；分散居住的职工家属绝大部分参加了街道妇代会。职工家属工作积极分子共一十八万三千五百五十五人。职工家属参加文化学习的人数由1952年的十四万七千多人，增加到五十四万人。职工家属积极参加团结互助工作，参加互助人数已经达四十五万人，比1954年增加了95.2％。他们勤俭持家，执行“五好”（勤俭持家好，团结互助好，教养子女好，清洁卫生好，努力学习好），努力支援职工的生产劳动，受到社会的尊敬。
