　　Resolutely Rectify and Launch a New Production Upsurge
    Speech by Representative Qi Tinghan (Abstract)
    Under the direct leadership and assistance of the Party and higher-level trade unions, the trade union committee of Factory 53 extensively mobilized all employees to launch a thorough socialist competition. Currently, the employees of our factory have reached the production level of the final year of the First Five-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule, and have completed the three comprehensive indicators of total production value, labor productivity, and cost of the First Five-Year Plan one year, five months, and twenty-seven days ahead of schedule.
    This year, our factory, in accordance with the Party Central Committee's instructions on rectification, launched three upsurges of airing views. During the upsurges, most employees spoke their minds freely.
    In order to comprehensively, thoroughly, and promptly handle the opinions raised by the masses, the Party committee determined the principles of handling in batches, at different levels, with each level responsible, leaders taking the lead, and combining with relying on the masses. We followed the principles determined by the Party committee and quickly handled the opinions raised by the employees. By November 23rd, 99.1% of the correct and reasonable problems that could be solved in our factory had been resolved. Due to the development of socialist democracy and the resolution of problems raised by employees, the political enthusiasm and creativity of the employees have soared unprecedentedly. In most workshops and sections, a new production upsurge has gradually formed, which has created favorable conditions for completing the annual national plan ahead of schedule and preparing for next year's production.
    I. On the Basis of Extensive Airing of Views, Thorough Rectification, and Major Improvements, How to Promote and Launch a New Production Upsurge.
    In order to conscientiously implement the policy of "both rectification and production are not neglected" and "rectifying while producing," enterprise leaders must clarify two most fundamental guiding ideologies: one is to improve production by starting with rectification, which means that the purpose of rectification in enterprises should be clarified, that is, to thoroughly change the leadership style, correct shortcomings in work, and better complete the national plan. At the same time, it is necessary to prevent and overcome the bias of those in charge of production who think they have no time to consider rectification, and those in charge of rectification who do not consider problems from the perspective of production. Facts have proved that only by first solving major problems in production, technology, and management can we inspire the morale of the masses and better ensure the completion of production tasks. Otherwise, if "thousands of problems are solved, but the production task is not completed," the enthusiasm of the masses will inevitably be damaged, and the purpose of rectification will not be achieved. The other idea that should be clarified is that leaders should take the lead in rectifying and combine with relying on the masses, paying attention to avoiding shortcomings such as leaders closing the door for rectification, the lower levels moving while the upper levels do not, the upper and lower levels not communicating, and not relying on the masses when solving problems. Facts have proved that only when all levels are responsible, and leaders and the masses work together, can problems be solved thoroughly and quickly, the relationship between leaders and the masses be close, and the enthusiasm of the masses be guided towards production, launching a new production upsurge.
    During the rectification, our trade union organization organized a large number of cadres and activists to participate in the work of various rectification groups. Then, a conference of employee representatives was convened to mobilize all employees to actively participate in the rectification, launching a mass rectification upsurge throughout the factory, and launching a new production upsurge on the basis of the rectification upsurge. Through the convening of the employee representative conference, all cadres and representatives further clarified that both rectification and production should not be neglected, starting from the overall situation, starting from production, implementing the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, managing households diligently and thriftily, spending less money, doing more things, and doing things without spending money. It was clarified that the principle of solving problems is to have both revolutionary spirit and to be realistic; to be bold and resolute, but also cautious and reasonable. After the meeting, the resolution of the conference was conveyed, mobilizing all employees, and new atmosphere immediately appeared in rectification work and production.
    II. Standing in Front of the Upsurge, Actively Leading the New Production Upsurge.
    After "airing views" and "rectification," the leadership style of the enterprise has been significantly improved, and the problems raised by the masses on production and management have been solved more comprehensively and systematically. The broad masses of employees have been educated in the rectification movement, greatly improving their socialist awareness. This means that this year's upsurge has a better political foundation, ideological foundation, and work foundation. The demands of the lower levels on the upper levels and the masses on the leaders are also higher. Using the old methods of the past to deal with new problems will not meet the requirements of work and the masses. This is also a new problem and a new difficulty faced by the leadership in this new upsurge.
    Our initial practices are:
    1. Overcome the waiting mentality and actively lead the upsurge. After we proposed "promoting a new production upsurge" in early October, most cadres had a waiting mentality. On the one hand, we explained to the cadres that a mass "rectification" upsurge would inevitably lead to a production upsurge, and explained the importance of launching an upsurge this year. On the other hand, we organized the forces of grassroots and workshop trade unions to comprehensively investigate the emergence of the upsurge, closely grasp the dynamics of the upsurge, support the enthusiasm of employees, vigorously publicize new people and new things, and educate cadres and employees to recognize that the upsurge has arrived.
    2. Make full use of the forms of employee representative conferences and production meetings to attract the broad masses to participate in enterprise management and establish a new trend of solving problems by ourselves. The employee representative conference also specifically discussed the five major key issues in production in the fourth quarter and labor discipline, so that all representatives clarified the goals of struggle in the fourth quarter and put forward guarantee measures.
    3. Carrying out competitions is an important method for trade unions to promote and lead the new production upsurge. According to the characteristics of many new products, many varieties, and frequent changes in the fourth quarter, we particularly emphasized that, in view of the different situations in production, various small competitions should be carried out in a flexible manner according to local conditions, and the experience of the ninth group of the second workshop, the third section of the third workshop, and the casting section of the seventh workshop in this regard was summarized and exchanged, which further promoted the development of production.
    4. Rely on veteran workers, advanced producers, and the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League backbone of the groups.
    Before the full launch of the upsurge, we held a factory-wide conference of veteran workers and a conference of advanced producers. Each workshop also held forums for veteran workers, forums for advanced producers, and trained the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League backbone of the groups, unified their thinking and steps, and put forward requirements to them.
    In addition, advanced producers throughout the factory initiated a proposal requiring each advanced producer to make new achievements in the upsurge, especially to help others reach advanced levels.
    5. Comprehensively carry out a great debate and continue to launch a new upsurge.
    Mass debates are an important method to continue to deepen the airing of views, rely on the masses to overcome the conservative thinking of leaders, implement rectifying while producing, and further launch a new production upsurge. The process of the great debate is the process of exposing and solving internal contradictions in the enterprise; it is the main form of the national rectification, everyone passing the socialist test; it is the best method for mass self-education. The process of the great debate is the process of clarifying major issues of right and wrong and raising the socialist awareness of the working class, and it is also a means of deeply carrying out a new production upsurge from the perspective of political ideology. Therefore, trade unions must organize and lead the mass debate work well. For example, when the thirteenth workshop started the debate, the workshop cadres were worried that it would affect production, but the result of the mass debate reversed the situation of not completing the monthly plan and very poor quality in the first three quarters. In October, production exceeded by 28%, and the rework rate decreased from more than 40% in the past to less than 20%; it is estimated that the task will be exceeded by more than 30% in November, and the rework rate will be further reduced to 10%; the new quotas revised in October have so far been broken by 58 people in two work sections, of which 24 people have requested to revise the new quotas.
    It can be predicted that when the rectification movement enters the stage of systematic socialist education, the new production upsurge will have greater development.
    III. Through Rectification and Production Upsurge, Improve the Work of Trade Unions One Step Further.
    Currently, we mainly focus on improving the rectification of the trade union itself on the basis of actively assisting the Party in doing a good job in the rectification movement and the new production upsurge.
    We believe that: assisting the Party in doing a good job in rectification, and guiding the political enthusiasm of employees to production through the new production upsurge is also the greatest rectification of the trade union organization in mass production work; assisting the Party in doing a good job in airing views, rectification, and great debates is actually carrying out a most profound and vivid self-education for employees, which is also the greatest rectification of the trade union organization in mass political work; at the same time, solving the correct and solvable problems raised by employees, and educating and explaining the incorrect or unsolvable problems to employees through great debates is actually the greatest rectification of the trade union organization in the lives and work of the masses; it can even be said that: assisting the Party in doing a good job in the rectification movement and the new production upsurge will further specifically and comprehensively play the role of the trade union as a link, pillar, guarantee, supervision, and communist school.
    While doing the above work well, we also paid attention to doing a good job in the rectification of the trade union itself under the leadership of the Party, otherwise the trade union will also be divorced from the masses.

　　坚决整改掀起新的生产高潮
    齐廷汉代表的发言（摘要）
    五三工厂工会委员会在党和上级工会的直接领导和帮助下，广泛发动全体职工深入开展了社会主义竞赛。现在我厂职工已提前二年达到了第一个五年计划最后一年的生产水平，提前一年零五个月又二十七天完成了第一个五年计划的生产总值、劳动生产率、成本三项综合性指标。
    我厂在今年根据党中央的整风指示，掀起了三次鸣放高潮。在鸣放高潮中，大部分职工作到了畅所欲言。
    为了全面、彻底、及时地处理群众提出的这些意见，党委确定了分批、分级、层层负责、领导亲自动手和依靠群众相结合的处理原则。我们遵照党委确定的这个原则迅速处理了职工提出的意见。凡是正确合理而又能够解决的问题到十一月二十三日我厂已解决了99.1％。由于发展了社会主义民主，解决了职工提出的问题，所以职工群众的政治积极性和创造性空前高涨。在大部分车间和工段里逐渐形成了新的生产高潮，这就给提前超额完成全年国家计划和作好明年生产准备工作创造了有利的条件。
    一、在大鸣、大放、大改的基础上，如何促进和掀起新的生产高潮。
    为了认真贯彻整风、生产两不误和边整边改的方针，企业领导干部必须明确两个最根本的指导思想：一个是从整改着手搞好生产，这就是说，应该明确在企业里整风的目的，就是彻底改变领导作风，纠正工作中的缺点，更好地完成国家计划，同时，必须防止和克服管生产的人认为没有时间考虑整改，而管整改的人不从生产着手考虑问题的偏向。事实证明，只有先解决生产、技术和管理上的重大问题，才能鼓舞群众情绪，更好地保证生产任务的完成。否则“问题改了千千万，生产任务完不成”，群众的积极性就一定受到损伤，而不能达到整改的目的。另一个应该明确的思想是，领导上亲自动手和依靠群众相结合进行整改，注意避免领导上关着门整风、下动上不动、上下不通气和在解决问题时不依靠群众等缺点。事实证明，只有上下层层负责，领导与群众一起动手，才能彻底、迅速地解决问题，才能密切领导与群众之间的关系，并把群众的积极性引导向搞生产上来，掀起新的生产高潮。
    我们工会组织在整改中，组织大批干部和积极分子参加各整改组的工作。接着，召开职工代表大会动员全体职工积极参加整改，在全厂范围内掀起一个群众性的整改高潮，并在整改高潮的基础上掀起新的生产高潮。通过召开职工代表大会，使全体干部和代表进一步明确了整风、生产两不误，从整体出发，从生产出发，贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭持家，少花钱，多办事，不花钱也办事的方针。明确了解决问题的原则是既要有革命精神，又要实事求是；既要大胆坚决，又要谨慎合理。会后通过传达大会决议，发动了全体职工，从而在整改工作和生产上立即出现了新气象。
    二、站在高潮前面，积极领导生产新高潮。
    经过“鸣放”和“整改”，企业的领导作风有了显著的改进，群众对生产和管理上提出的问题，得到了较全面、系统的解决，广大的职工群众在整风运动中受到了教育，大大提高了社会主义觉悟。这就是说，今年的高潮有更好的政治基础、思想基础和工作基础。下级对上级、群众对领导的要求也就更高了，再用过去的旧方法处理新问题，就不能满足工作和群众的要求了，这也是领导这次新高潮所面临的新问题和新困难。
    我们的初步做法是：
    1．克服等待情绪，积极领导高潮。10月初我们提出“促进生产新高潮”以后，在大部分干部中有一种等待情绪。我们一方面向干部解释：通过群众性“整改”高潮，必然会出现生产高潮，并说明了今年掀起高潮的重要意义：一方面组织基层和车间工会力量全面调查高潮出现的情况，紧紧掌握高潮的动态，支持职工的积极性，大力宣传新人新事，教育干部和职工认识高潮已经到来。
    2．充分运用职工代表大会和生产会议的形式，吸引广大群众参加企业管理，树立自己动手解决问题的新风气。职工代表大会还专门讨论了四季度生产上的五大关键和劳动纪律问题，使全体代表明确了第四季度的奋斗目标，并提出了保证措施。
    3．开展竞赛是工会促进与领导生产新高潮的重要方法。根据第四季度新产品多、品种多而且经常变化的特点，我们特别强调了针对生产上的不同情况，因地制宜地灵活地开展多种多样的小型竞赛，并总结交流了二车间九道小组、三车间三工段和七车间铸工工段这方面的经验，这样就进一步推动了生产的发展。
    4．依靠老工人、先进生产者和小组的党、政、工、团骨干。
    我们在全面掀起高潮以前，召开了全厂老工人大会和先进生产者大会，各车间也分别召开了老工人座谈会、先进生产者座谈会和训练小组党、政、工、团骨干，统一他们的思想和步调，向他们提出要求。
    此外，全厂先进生产者发起倡议，要求每个先进生产者都在高潮中作出新的成绩，特别是帮助别人达到先进水平。
    5．全面开展大辩论，继续开展新高潮。
  群众性的大辩论是继续深入鸣放，依靠群众克服领导保守思想，贯彻边整边改，进一步开展生产新高潮的重要方法，大辩论的过程即是揭露和解决企业内部矛盾的过程；它是全民性的整风、人人过社会主义这一关的主要形式；它是群众自我教育最好的方法。大辩论的过程就是弄清大是大非、提高工人阶级社会主义觉悟的过程，也是从政治思想上深入开展生产新高潮的手段。因此，工会必须很好地组织领导群众性的大辩论工作。如十三车间开始辩论时，车间干部担心会影响生产，但群众辩论的结果，相反地扭转了前三季一贯完不成月计划和质量非常低劣的状况，10月份超产28％，返修率由过去的40％以上减少到20％以下；11月份预计超任务30％以上，返修率进一步减少到10％；10月份修改的新定额，到目前为止已被两个工段中的五十八人所突破，其中有二十四人要求修改新定额。
    可以预计，当整风运动进入系统的社会主义教育阶段的时候，生产新高潮必将有更大的发展。
    三、通过整风和生产高潮，把工会工作提高一步。
    当前，我们主要是在积极协助党搞好整风运动和生产新高潮的基础上，搞好工会本身的整改。
    我们认为：协助党搞好整改，通过生产新高潮，把职工的政治积极性引导到生产上去，这也正是工会组织在群众生产工作上的最大整改；协助党搞好鸣放、整改和大辩论，实际上是对职工进行一次最深刻、最生动的自我教育，这也正是工会组织在群众政治工作上的最大整改；同时使职工提出的正确而又可以解决的问题都得到解决，不正确或不能解决的问题，通过大辩论对职工进行了教育和解释，这实际上是工会组织在群众生活工作上的最大整改；甚至可以说：协助党搞好整风运动和新的生产高潮，必将进一步具体地、全面地发挥工会的纽带、支柱、保证、监督及共产主义学校的作用。
    在搞好以上工作的同时，我们还注意了在党的领导下，搞好工会本身的整改，不然工会也会脱离群众。
