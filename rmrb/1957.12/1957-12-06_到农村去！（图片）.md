　　To the Countryside!
　　The rectification movement at Fudan University has entered a new high tide. The campus is filled with the sound of gongs and drums, a scene of joy and celebration. Teachers, students, and staff are vying to write letters of determination to the leadership, requesting to be sent down to the countryside to receive labor training. The first group of 180 people have been approved, and they are happily preparing to depart.
