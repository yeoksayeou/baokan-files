New Year pictures for 1958, published by the People's Fine Arts Publishing House and the Chaohua Fine Arts Publishing House, have mostly begun to be sold in various bookstores.

The newly published New Year pictures include more ancient paintings and sketches of traditional Chinese paintings than in previous years. The vast majority of these works have the characteristics of New Year pictures, such as auspiciousness and festivity, reflecting the thriving new atmosphere of socialist construction. The four-panel screen New Year picture "A Summer Story," adapted from a film story, depicts a young student who, after graduating from junior high school, joins in labor production after ideological struggle. The New Year picture "Friendship" depicts the enthusiastic scene of youths, old people, and children of various ethnic groups thanking Soviet experts during the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. The New Year picture "Celebrating a Bumper Harvest" depicts the joyous scene of rural children celebrating the harvest. New Year pictures such as "Feeding Pigs" and "Apple Harvest" all express the pleasant mood of collective farmers.

The two publishing houses have also reprinted two representative works from Yangliuqing, Hebei: "Fish and Water United for a Thousand Years" and "Five Boys Snatching the Lotus." The publishing houses have also printed works by Qi Baishi, Xu Beihong, Ren Bonian, and Wu Changshuo. (Xinhua News Agency)

    新年画上市
    由人民美术出版社和朝花美术出版社出版的1958年新年画，绝大多数已经开始在各书店出售。
    新出版的年画比往年增添了古画和国画写生，这些作品绝大部分都具有年画的吉祥喜庆等特色，反映出社会主义建设欣欣向荣的新气象。根据电影故事编绘的四扇屏年画“夏天的故事”，描绘一个初中毕业的青年学生经过思想斗争后参加了劳动生产。年画“友谊”表现了武汉长江大桥建筑中各族青年、老人和小孩向苏联专家致谢的热烈场面。年画“庆丰图”描绘了农村儿童庆祝丰收的欢乐景象。“喂猪”、“苹果丰收”等年画都表现出集体农民的愉快心情。
    这两个出版社还重印了两幅河北杨柳青的有代表性的作品：“鱼水千年合”、“五子夺莲”。出版社还印了齐白石、徐悲鸿、任伯年、吴昌硕的作品。　（新华社）
