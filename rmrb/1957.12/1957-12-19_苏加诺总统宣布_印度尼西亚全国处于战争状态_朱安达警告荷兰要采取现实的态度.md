Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 18th: Indonesian President Sukarno announced on Indonesian radio on the evening of the 17th that, according to the Emergency Law, all parts of the Republic of Indonesia, including its territory, airspace, and territorial waters, are in a state of war.

President Sukarno also announced that the Emergency Law passed by the Parliament on October 2nd would come into effect on December 17th. The military martial law regulations that existed in Indonesia before December 17th were formulated during the Dutch colonial government.

President Sukarno also announced the revocation of the military martial law decree issued on March 14th of this year. President Sukarno issued this military martial law decree under the old military martial law regulations after the resignation of the previous Sastroamidjojo cabinet. Indonesia has been under military martial law since March 14th.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 18th: Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda said today that if the Netherlands remains unwilling to adopt a realistic attitude, Indonesia will continue to take action. He said that the measures taken by Indonesia against the Netherlands in the economic field have not yet reached the extent demanded by the citizens of Jakarta at the rally on November 18th calling for the recovery of West Irian.

Speaking about the relationship with the Netherlands, Djuanda said that Indonesia will continue to maintain friendly relations with the Netherlands as it does with other countries, but will not grant it or any other country any special rights or conveniences.

Djuanda expressed his unwillingness for any foreign intervention in the dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands. He denied newspaper reports that the United States had suggested that Indonesia and the Netherlands hold negotiations.

Djuanda said that the Indonesian government is trying to expand its trade with foreign countries. He said, however, that this cannot be done hastily in a way that would harm Indonesia's interests.

Djuanda said that the claim that other countries will replace the Netherlands' economic position in Indonesia is incorrect because it is not in line with Indonesia's policy.

Djuanda said that Indonesia is taking action against Dutch enterprises based on the Emergency Law and other promulgated regulations. According to the law, all enterprises have the obligation to cooperate with and assist the government, but Dutch enterprises have not done so. Therefore, Indonesia believes it is necessary to take action to enable these enterprises to carry out their normal activities.

    苏加诺总统宣布
    印度尼西亚全国处于战争状态
    朱安达警告荷兰要采取现实的态度
    新华社雅加达18日电　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺在17日晚间通过印度尼西亚广播电台宣布，根据紧急状态法令，印度尼西亚共和国的各部分，包括领土、领空和领海，都处于战争状态。
    苏加诺总统还宣布，国会在10月2日通过的这项紧急状态法令从12月17日开始施行。12月17日以前在印度尼西亚存在的军事戒严条例是在荷兰殖民政府时期制定的。
    苏加诺总统同时宣布撤销在今年3月14日颁布的军事戒严令。苏加诺总统曾经在前任沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁辞职以后，根据旧的军事戒严条例颁布了这项军事戒严令。从3月14日起，印度尼西亚一直处于军事戒严状态之下。
    据新华社雅加达18日电　印度尼西亚总理朱安达今天说，如果荷兰仍然不愿意采取现实的态度，印度尼西亚将继续采取行动。他说，印度尼西亚在经济方面对荷兰所采取的措施，还没有达到雅加达市民群众在11月18日集会要求收复西伊里安时所要求采取的那种程度。
    朱安达在谈到对荷兰的关系的问题时说，印度尼西亚将继续同荷兰保持它同其他国家一样的友好关系，但是，将不给予它或者其他国家以任何特殊权利和便利。
    朱安达表示不愿意有外国对印度尼西亚同荷兰的争执作任何的干涉。他否认报纸所刊载的美国已经建议印度尼西亚同荷兰举行谈判的消息。
    朱安达说，印度尼西亚政府正在设法扩大它同外国的贸易。他说，但是，这不能仓促行事以致损害印度尼西亚的利益。
    朱安达说，将有其他国家来取代荷兰在印度尼西亚的经济地位这种说法是不正确的，因为这并不符合印度尼西亚的政策。
    朱安达说，印度尼西亚是根据紧急状态法令和其他已经颁布的条例来对荷兰的企业采取行动的。根据法律，一切企业有同政府合作和帮助政府的义务，但是，荷兰企业没有这样做，因此，印度尼西亚认为有必要采取行动，以使这些企业进行它们的正常活动。
