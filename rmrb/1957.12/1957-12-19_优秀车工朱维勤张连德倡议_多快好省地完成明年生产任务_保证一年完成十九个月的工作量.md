　　Outstanding Lathe Operators Zhu Weiqin and Zhang Liande Advocate:
    Complete Next Year's Production Tasks with Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results
    Guaranteeing the Completion of Nineteen Months' Worth of Work in One Year
    (Our Newspaper's Dispatch) Excellent lathe operators Zhu Weiqin and Zhang Liande from the Dalian Shipyard's Machine Workshop have proposed an initiative to all young workers in the Lüda area: to complete the 1958 production tasks with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. On the 14th, Zhu Weiqin read their proposal at the Lüda Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League's meeting of youth worker activists.
    The proposal stated: The nation's First Five-Year Plan has been comprehensively overfulfilled, and the massive Second Five-Year Plan is about to begin. Recently, the Party Central Committee proposed that in the next fifteen years, our country should be built into a strong socialist nation with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, and that we should catch up with or surpass England in the production of steel and other important industrial products. We deeply feel that the tasks before us are extremely arduous and significant. We will encounter many difficulties on our road forward. However, no difficulty can scare us. We warmly respond to the call of the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions to all workers across the country, and we will take practical actions, work hard, move forward bravely, overcome all difficulties, and complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party and the people. We must further raise our class consciousness in the rectification campaign and socialist education movement, overcome non-working-class ideas, and establish the ideas of honest labor, observing discipline, thrift and simplicity, hard work, and loving the factory as our home. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, we must work with the city's youth to deeply carry out socialist labor emulation, and strive to complete the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan – 1958 – with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, on the basis of successfully completing the First Five-Year Plan.
    At the 1955 Liaoning Provincial Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference, Zhu Weiqin and Zhang Liande proposed to complete eight years' worth of production quotas during the First Five-Year Plan period. On September 18th of this year, they achieved this goal ahead of schedule. At the National Day celebration held by the Lüda Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League this year, they further proposed to complete eight years and eleven months' worth of work by the end of the year. Now, this revised plan has also been overfulfilled. In this proposal, they propose to complete nineteen months' worth of work in 1958. They also put forward five specific guarantees regarding output, quality, conservation, safe production, and labor discipline.
    Their proposal was warmly received by the young workers attending the Lüda Municipal Youth Worker Activists Conference. Youth teams and individuals from thirteen factories put forward responses to the proposal, and representatives from youth teams from five factories expressed their determination at the conference.

　　优秀车工朱维勤张连德倡议
    多快好省地完成明年生产任务
    保证一年完成十九个月的工作量
    本报讯　大连造船厂机械车间优秀车工朱维勤、张连德向旅大全市青年职工提出倡议：又多又快又好又省地完成1958年的生产任务。14日，朱维勤在共青团旅大市委员会召开的全市青年职工积极分子大会上宣读了他们的倡议书。
    倡议书中说：国家第一个五年计划已经全面超额完成了，规模巨大的第二个五年计划即将开始。最近，党中央提出要在今后十五年内，把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国，并要在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国。我们深深感到摆在我们面前的任务是十分艰巨而重大的。在我们前进的道路上是会遇到很多困难的。但是，任何困难都吓不倒我们。我们热烈地响应中国工会第八次全国代表大会告全国职工书的号召，拿出实际行动来，拿出干劲来，积极工作，勇敢前进，战胜一切困难，完成党和人民所交给我们的光荣任务。我们要在整风和社会主义教育运动中，进一步提高阶级觉悟，克服非工人阶级思想，树立诚实劳动、遵守纪律、勤俭朴素、艰苦奋斗、爱厂如家的思想。在增产节约运动中，要和全市青年一起深入开展社会主义劳动竞赛，争取在胜利完成第一个五年计划的基础上，又多、又快、又好、又省地完成第二个五年计划的第一年——1958年的生产任务。
    朱维勤和张连德在1955年辽宁省青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上，曾经提出要在第一个五年计划期间完成八年的生产定额。今年9月18日，他们就提前实现了这一奋斗目标。在今年共青团旅大市委会举行的国庆节庆祝会上，他们又提出到年末要完成八年零十一个月的工作量。现在这个修改了的计划也已经超额完成了。在这次的倡议书中，他们提出要在1958年内完成十九个月的工作量。他们还就产量、质量、节约、安全生产、劳动纪律等方面提出了五项具体保证条件。
    他们的倡议受到参加旅大市青年职工积极分子会议的青年职工的热烈响应。有十三个工厂的青年班组和个人提出了响应倡议书，有五个工厂的青年班组的代表在大会上表示了决心。
