Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 17th: US Democratic Senator Mansfield said on a television program on the 15th that Bulganin's proposals in the letters he sent to Eisenhower and other national leaders last week should be considered.

    He called for an immediate halt to nuclear weapons testing "on a multilateral basis" and "under a sound system of regulations and inspections," followed by discussions on how to halt nuclear weapons production. He also called on the United States to consider the "neutralization of both East and West Germany."

    Mansfield also said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is currently in a "state of disarray" and that the future of the group's top-level meeting "is highly questionable." He called for strict measures to save the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He also said that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" has never been of any great significance.

    据新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：美国民主党参议员曼斯菲尔德15日在电视节目中说：应该考虑布尔加宁在上星期给艾森豪威尔和其他国家领袖的信中所提出来的建议。
    他要求“在多边的基础上”和“完善的规定和视察制度下”立即停止核武器试验，然后再进行如何停止核武器生产的讨论。他还要求美国考虑“东德和西德都中立化”。
    曼斯菲尔德还说，北大西洋集团目前正处于“混乱状态”，这个集团的最高级会议的前途“是十分值得怀疑的”。他要求采取严格的措施来挽救北大西洋集团。他还说，“艾森豪威尔主义”一直是没有什么重要意义的。
