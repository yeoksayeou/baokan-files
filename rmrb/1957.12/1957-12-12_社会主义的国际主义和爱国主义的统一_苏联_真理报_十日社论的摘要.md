Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th: TASS, Moscow, reported: The "Pravda" published an editorial on the 10th entitled "The Unity of Socialist Internationalism and Patriotism."

The editorial said that the two declarations passed at the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties in Moscow have become the focus of widespread public opinion around the world. Plenary sessions of the Central Committees of Communist and Workers' Parties, meetings of party activists, and numerous labor organizations are discussing these two documents of truly great historical significance.

The discussion of the two declarations proves that the communist and workers' parties of all countries are more closely united than ever under the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. When considering important issues arising from the specific national conditions of each country, the fraternal parties closely link them with the common tasks of striving for peace, democracy, and socialism, and striving to further unite the strength of the international communist movement.

The editorial said that since Marx and Engels declared proletarian internationalism as the guiding principle of the laboring people's struggle for liberation, the bourgeoisie has continuously slandered internationalism. The thinkers of the exploiting classes and all kinds of sham socialists have repeatedly insisted that patriotism and internationalism are incompatible, and that internationalists deny the motherland. This kind of slander by the bourgeoisie has been refuted thoroughly by Lenin, the great defender of the unity of the workers' international. Lenin once pointed out that correctly understood national interests are fully in line with the socialist interests of the proletariat of all countries.

In fact, was not the victorious completion of the October Socialist Revolution of 1917 a great patriotic achievement of our country's working class and laboring peasants? This revolution freed Russia from the imperialist war and prevented a national tragedy for Russia. At the same time, October also marked the great victory of proletarian internationalist thought. It was the October Revolution that broke the chains of national oppression, realized the complete equality of all nationalities residing in the Soviet state, and raised the banner against the exploitation of man by man.

The unified multi-ethnic state created under the leadership of the Communist Party—the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics—is a vivid embodiment of the Communist Party's Marxist-Leninist internationalist policy. In the Soviet state, the friendship among all nationalities has been strengthened and has become unshakable.

The editorial said that the combination of patriotism and internationalism is the ideological foundation of the socialist national family within our country and the foundation of relations between socialist countries and between all communist and workers' parties.

The editorial pointed out that fraternal mutual assistance is an integral part of the mutual relations between socialist countries. This mutual assistance truly embodies the principles of socialist internationalism. Broad economic and cultural cooperation based on mutual benefit and mutual assistance plays an extremely important role in consolidating the economic and political independence of each socialist country and consolidating the entire socialist family.

The editorial pointed out that in order to deceive the masses, the imperialist bourgeoisie has used all ideological influence to slander socialism, rampantly advocate nationalism and cosmopolitanism, and attempt to stifle the people's love for their motherland and their national consciousness in their struggle for national liberation. Therefore, the communist and workers' parties correctly believe that strengthening Marxist-Leninist education for the masses, fighting against decadent bourgeois ideology, and publicizing the ideas of socialism, peace, and friendship among the people of all countries are one of their basic tasks.

The editorial concluded by saying that communists are both consistent internationalists and true patriots of their own countries. They are at the forefront of the struggle for peace and against the instigators of imperialist war. As long as they strengthen the unity of their ranks, irreconcilably fight against the imperialist bourgeoisie and its agents—all kinds of revisionists—and combine the great ideas of proletarian internationalism with the patriotism of the broad masses of the people, then the communist and workers' parties will surely achieve new victories in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

　　社会主义的国际主义和爱国主义的统一
    苏联“真理报”十日社论的摘要
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”10日以“社会主义的国际主义和爱国主义的统一”为题发表了社论。
    社论说，在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党代表会议上通过的两个宣言成为全世界广泛的舆论的中心。各国共产党和工人党中央委员会全体会议和党积极分子会议以及许许多多劳动者团体都在讨论这两项具有真正伟大历史意义的文件。
    讨论两个宣言的情况证明，各国共产党和工人党比任何时候都更紧密地团结在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的战无不胜的旗帜下。各兄弟党在考虑由每个国家的具体的民族条件而产生的重大问题时，把它同争取和平、民主和社会主义，争取进一步团结国际共产主义运动的力量的共同任务密切联系起来。
    社论说，自从马克思和恩格斯宣布无产阶级国际主义为劳动人民解放斗争的指导原则以来，资产阶级就不断地对国际主义进行污蔑。剥削阶级的思想家和形形色色的冒牌社会主义者都一再硬说：爱国主义和国际主义是不相容的，国际主义者是否定祖国的。资产阶级的这种谰言已被工人国际团结的伟大捍卫者列宁驳得体无完肤。列宁曾经指出，被正确理解的民族利益是完全符合各国无产阶级的社会主义利益的。
    从事实上看，难道1917年十月社会主义革命的胜利完成不是我国工人阶级和劳动农民伟大爱国主义的丰功伟绩吗？这次革命使俄国摆脱了帝国主义战争，防止了俄国的民族悲剧。而在同时，十月也标志着无产阶级国际主义思想的伟大胜利。正是十月革命打断了民族压迫的锁链，实现了居住在苏维埃国家内的各民族的完全平等，举起了反对任何人剥削人的现象的旗帜。
    在共产党领导下创建的统一的多民族国家——苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟是共产党的马克思列宁主义国际主义政策的活生生的化身。在苏维埃国家里，各族人民的友谊加强了，并且变得不可动摇了。
    社论说，爱国主义同国际主义的结合是我国内部社会主义民族大家庭的思想基础，是社会主义阵营各国之间、所有共产党和工人党之间关系的基础。
    社论指出，兄弟的互相援助是各社会主义国家相互关系的不可缺的一部分。这种互相援助切实地体现了社会主义国际主义的原则。以互利和互助为基础的广泛的经济和文化合作，在巩固每一个社会主义国家的经济和政治独立、巩固整个社会主义大家庭方面起着极其重要的作用。
    社论指出，帝国主义资产阶级为了欺骗群众，施展了一切思想影响手段，它诽谤社会主义，猖狂地鼓吹民族主义和世界主义，企图扼杀为自己的民族解放而斗争的人民的热爱自己祖国的精神和他们的民族自觉。所以共产党和工人党正确地认为，加强对群众进行马克思列宁主义教育，同堕落的资产阶级思想作斗争，宣传社会主义、和平和各国人民友好的思想，是自己的基本任务之一。
    社论最后说，共产党人既是一贯的国际主义者，又是本国的真正的爱国主义者。他们走在争取和平、反对帝国主义战争挑拨者的斗争的前列。只要加强自己队伍的团结，不调和地同帝国主义资产阶级及其代理人——形形色色的修正主义者进行斗争，把无产阶级国际主义的伟大思想同广大人民群众的爱国主义结合起来，那末共产党和工人党一定能在争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中取得新的胜利。
