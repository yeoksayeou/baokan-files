An Example of Leading Cadres Valuing Mass Opinions

Our general leading comrades are very busy, and the higher-level leading comrades are even busier. However, despite being busy, this does not prevent them from devoting part of their energy to personally handling some of the problems raised by the masses. Li Fuchun, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Planning Commission, has set a good example in this regard.

During the period of extensive airing of views in the State Planning Commission after it entered the rectification and improvement phase, comrades Su Qin and Xu Yixin from the Transportation Bureau posted a big-character poster, requesting Comrade Li Fuchun to help resolve the relationship between the Planning Commission's Transportation Bureau and the Ministry of Transportation. Because the two sides had not been in close contact in the past, the Transportation Bureau could not attend some meetings of the Ministry of Transportation related to planning work, and the necessary information in this area was not available to them. This big-character poster was posted on November 5th, and on November 11th, these two comrades received a reply from the Director's office. They were told that after Comrade Li Fuchun read their big-character poster, he personally wrote a letter to Kong Xiangzhen, Vice Minister of Transportation and Party Secretary of the Ministry, requesting the Ministry of Transportation to consider whether it could notify the Transportation Bureau to send people to attend future meetings related to planning work and inspections, and to send relevant materials to the Transportation Bureau. The General Office of the Ministry of Transportation notified all relevant units on November 22nd to handle the matter in accordance with the opinions put forward by Comrade Li Fuchun. Now, the connection between the Planning Commission's Transportation Bureau and the Ministry of Transportation has been strengthened compared to the past.

The fact that Comrade Li Fuchun personally handled the opinions raised by the masses proves that leading cadres, even leading cadres like Comrade Li Fuchun, can still spare some time to handle problems that should be resolved by them, despite their extraordinarily busy work. Whether or not this can be done depends on whether or not they value the opinions of the masses and whether or not they are determined to carry out rectification and improvement. If they value the opinions of the masses and are determined to carry out rectification and improvement, then even if they are very busy, they can still squeeze out time.

Of course, this does not mean that leading cadres should personally solve every problem, no matter how big or small. However, if the opinions raised by the masses to the leadership during the airing of views period should be resolved and can be resolved, it is best for the leading cadres to solve them themselves. This will not only solve the problems quickly, but also greatly encourage the masses' confidence in rectification and improvement, and push the rectification movement forward. Leading cadres can also use the opportunity to handle the problems raised by the masses to strengthen their ties with the masses and gain a more direct understanding of the actual work situation and problems.

### 领导干部重视群众意见的一例

　  领导干部重视群众意见的一例
    我们一般领导同志的工作都很忙，比较高级的领导同志就更忙。但是，忙尽管忙，却并不影响他们分出一部分精力来亲自动手处理一部分群众提出来的问题。国务院副总理、国家计划委员会主任李富春同志，就在这一方面树立了良好的榜样。
    在国家计划委员会转入整改后的大鸣大放中，交通局的苏勤和徐一新同志，贴了一张大字报，要求李富春同志帮助解决计委交通局和交通部的关系问题。因为过去两方面联系得不够密切，交通局需要参加交通部有关计划工作方面的一些会议不能参加，需要的这一方面的资料也得不到。这张大字报是11月5日贴出的，11日这两位同志就得到了主任办公室的复信。告诉他们：李富春同志看了他们的大字报后，自己亲笔写了一封信给交通部副部长兼党组书记孔祥桢，请求交通部考虑以后召开有关计划工作方面的一些会议，以及派人出去检查工作，是否能通知交通局派人参加，有关资料也请送给交通局一份。交通部办公厅已在11月22日通知各个有关单位，按照李富春同志提出的意见来办理。现在，计委交通局和交通部的联系已较过去加强了。
    从李富春同志亲自动手处理群众提出的意见这件事可以证明：领导干部，甚至像李富春同志这样的领导干部，虽然工作异常繁忙，也仍然可以抽出一部分时间，来处理应该由他们解决的问题。能不能这样做，就在于对群众的意见重视不重视，对整改究竟有没有决心。如果重视群众的意见，决心进行整改，那么，即使很忙，也还是可以挤出时间来。
    当然，这并不是说事无大小都要领导干部亲自动手解决。但是，在鸣放期中群众对领导提出来的意见，如果应该解决而又可以解决的，领导干部最好自己动手解决。这样，不但可以迅速解决问题，而且可以大大鼓舞群众对整改的信心，将整风运动推向前进；而领导干部也可以通过处理群众提出来的问题，密切同群众的联系，可以更加直接地了解实际工作中的情况和问题。
