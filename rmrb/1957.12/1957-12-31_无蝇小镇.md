    Fly-Free Town
　　Xu Chi
    Reading the newspaper, I learned that my hometown, Nanxun in Zhejiang Province, is a fly-free town, and I like it very much:
    I feel as if I have just returned from a bath,
    Feeling light, comfortable, and invigorated,
    Emitting a faint scent of soap,
    My body clean and transparent, like plastic.
    I seem to feel that I live in
    My bright house with many windows,
    Tidied up spotlessly,
    Working in an orderly manner.
    Outside the window are neat courtyards and neighborhoods,
    The leaves of the poplars are shimmering, the river water is white,
    The sun shines all over the town,
    The townspeople are bright, happy, and lively.
    Covering it like a layer of white snow,
    Washing it clean like a spring rain,
    This is cultural hygiene in the new society,
    Ah, my hometown, fly-free town.

    无蝇小镇
　　徐迟
    读报知道我的家乡浙江省南浔是一个无蝇的小镇，喜欢极了：
    我仿佛刚刚沐浴归来，
    感到轻快、舒适、振奋，
    散发轻微的胰子香，
    身体干净透明，像塑料制成。
    我仿佛感到我生活在
    我多窗的光亮的屋子里，
    收拾得一尘不染，
    工作得有条有理。
    窗外是整齐的庭院街坊，
    白杨的叶子闪闪，河水洁白，
    阳光普照在小镇上，
    镇人光亮，欢乐，活泼。
    覆盖它好比白雪一层，
    洗净它好比春雨一阵，
    是新社会里的文化卫生，
    啊，我的家乡，无蝇小镇。
