Editor's note: The report by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on establishing a socialist education curriculum and the approval from the Central Committee have been widely welcomed. They are considered effective measures for linking theory with practice, enhancing the socialist consciousness of intellectuals, and promoting the socialist revolution on the ideological front. At the same time, some people lack a sufficient understanding of the significance of this measure, and given the lack of experience in establishing such a curriculum, some problems do exist in the work. Reprinted here are two editorials from the journal *Study* on this issue. The first was published in the 23rd issue of the journal in 1957, dated December 3rd. The second will be published in the 24th issue of the journal in 1957, dated December 18th.

How to Understand the "Socialist Education Curriculum"?

The approval by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China of the "Report on Establishing a Socialist Education Curriculum" by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee (published in the previous issue of this journal) is of extremely important significance for our country's current Marxist-Leninist education work.

Why establish a socialist education curriculum? This is because our country is undergoing a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, and everyone must pass the socialist test. The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee stated in its "Report" that the purpose of establishing this curriculum is to "transform the old thinking of intellectuals and enhance the socialist consciousness of students." A large number of facts during the stages of the Great Blooming and Contending and the anti-Rightist struggle have proven that if the old thinking of intellectuals is not transformed, they will not only fail to serve socialism well, but may even be captured by bourgeois rightists and do bad things that are detrimental to the people. At present, although the anti-Rightist struggle has achieved a decisive victory, this does not mean that the influence of bourgeois political thought in the minds of intellectuals has been completely eliminated. Things are not so simple. After the anti-Rightist struggle, although the vast majority of intellectuals and cadres have recognized the reactionary political stance of the rightists in opposing socialism and the Communist Party and expressed great indignation at their reactionary words and deeds, many people are still unclear, or unable to fully understand, the errors in the numerous bourgeois viewpoints spread by the rightists, such as attacking the socialist path, attacking the leadership of the Communist Party, attacking the dictatorship of the proletariat, and attacking democratic centralism and internationalism. In addition, bourgeois thoughts such as individualism, departmentalism, liberalism, anarchism, egalitarianism, and reactionary nationalism that exist among intellectuals will require a very long period to be fundamentally transformed. Therefore, on the basis of the victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, it is entirely necessary to organize the study of this curriculum among college students, middle-level cadres of the entire Party, leading cadres and intellectuals of state organs, the military, and enterprises. This study is, in fact, an integral part of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts.

Some people believe that establishing the socialist education curriculum is a temporary measure, only to "coordinate with the current movement." They believe that this curriculum is not important for learning Marxist-Leninist theory, and even think that this curriculum "is not theory," "lacks systematicness," and that studying this curriculum will "delay the study of Marxist-Leninist theory." These arguments are extremely wrong. Judging from these arguments, these comrades still have not clarified such fundamental questions as "what is theory" and "why study theory." Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, "The only genuine theory in the world is theory drawn from objective reality and then verified by objective reality; nothing else deserves to be called theory as we understand it." He also said that the purpose of mastering Marxist theory "lies entirely in application." He said, "What kind of theorists do we want? We want theorists who can correctly explain the practical problems arising in the course of history and revolution in accordance with the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism, and who can give scientific explanations and theoretical elucidations of the various problems of China's economy, politics, military affairs, and culture." Establishing the socialist education curriculum is precisely to enable people to study Marxist-Leninist theory in connection with the current practice of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country. This method of learning can most effectively help people learn how to correctly use the theoretical weapon of Marxism-Leninism. Why do some people instead think that it will "delay" the study of theory? This erroneous understanding of "theory" was severely criticized as early as the rectification movement in 1942. Comrades who still hold these arguments must seriously read Comrade Mao Zedong's article "Rectify the Party's Style of Work" and seriously examine their own erroneous views on theory; otherwise, they will inevitably embark on the wrong path, and their study of theory will not produce any practical results.

Comrades with the above-mentioned erroneous viewpoints regard the socialist education curriculum as far less important than other Marxist-Leninist theory courses. This is also extremely wrong. We believe that among the basic Marxist-Leninist theory courses, if the socialist education course is not studied well first, there is no way to study the other courses well. We know that Marxism-Leninism is not a product of the academy, nor is it a tool for people to use to show off their knowledge. It is the fighting weapon of the proletariat. It is completely different from natural science or technical knowledge, which are non-class-based. To learn and master this science, it can only be done by those who are determined to stand on the socialist and proletarian standpoints. All those who come from the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, if they are unwilling to be determined to take the socialist road and transform their old thinking, they will absolutely not be able to learn Marxist-Leninist theory well. Facts have proven that Marxist-Leninist theory courses are always incompatible and difficult to learn for those who adhere to the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois standpoints. Although they sometimes participate in the study of Marxist-Leninist courses, and even spout Marxist-Leninist phrases, in reality, this is just a show. In addition to these people, there are also some people who really want to learn Marxist-Leninist theory well, but because they do not connect with reality and their own thinking in their studies, the results are very meager. Now, this socialist education curriculum is primarily to solve the problem of people's socialist standpoint and proletarian standpoint in connection with reality. For those who have already solved the problem of the proletarian standpoint, this curriculum is to help them correctly understand the major issues in the current socialist revolution and socialist construction, and further enhance their socialist consciousness. Therefore, everyone who is willing to take the socialist road and everyone who has the desire to learn Marxist-Leninist theory well must first learn this curriculum with a very serious attitude.

How can we learn this curriculum well? The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee stated in its "Report," "The method of learning should be to carefully read the documents and conduct free and full discussions." In addition, teachers and tutors of theoretical courses should also closely integrate with the students' thinking and provide necessary lectures and guidance. Carefully reading the documents and understanding the basic content of the documents is to master the weapon for studying practical problems and transforming thinking. Free and full discussions mean fully promoting the spirit of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" and launching a great debate in the process of learning theory in order to clarify right and wrong and improve understanding. In the discussion, everyone must be allowed to speak freely, and they must present facts, reason things out, and adhere to the principle of convincing people with reason. Naturally, this method of learning is different from the teaching methods of past theoretical courses. Some teachers of theoretical courses feel that there are no established rules to follow and therefore feel great difficulty. We believe that there are difficulties, but they are by no means insurmountable. We must first see that Comrade Mao Zedong's works and the other many documents stipulated for reading in this curriculum are the best examples of combining theory with practice and are closely related to the current revolutionary practice. In addition, in the recent anti-Rightist struggle, a large number of anti-Party and anti-socialist speeches by rightists were exposed, which makes it possible to enrich the content of the debate. These are the most favorable conditions for teaching this curriculum well. As for "no established rules to follow," this seems to be a shortcoming, but it may not be an advantage. Because, in the past few years of teaching Marxist-Leninist theory courses, although many experiences have been created and great achievements have been made, there are still some tendencies to memorize books by rote, not connect with reality, and not pay attention to transforming thinking, within a certain range. In the teaching of many teachers, there is still a tendency to not understand the students' thinking, memorize lecture notes by rote, like to dwell on terms and concepts, and simply instill knowledge. In order to give play to the fighting spirit of Marxism-Leninism and its lively and vigorous spirit, we must resolutely correct the shortcomings in past work and resolutely implement the principle of combining theory with practice. In order to achieve this goal, we should also seriously study and appropriately apply the good experiences in theoretical teaching in the past revolutionary base areas, apply the experiences gained in the rectification movement, and strive to explore and create new experiences that are suitable for the current situation.

The work of teachers plays a decisive role in teaching this curriculum well. Therefore, excellent theoretical course teachers must be organized to teach this curriculum. In recent years, we have organized a team of teachers for Marxist-Leninist theory courses, and the achievements in this regard cannot be denied. However, this team still needs to be greatly strengthened and improved. In addition to the rightists and those who are really not suitable for this work who should be transferred away, the teachers from veteran cadres in this team must strengthen their learning of theoretical knowledge in the next few years. Many teachers from young intellectuals must first transform their class standpoints and go to the countryside and factories to greatly strengthen their ideological training. All teachers, in order to improve their work, must strengthen their understanding of the actual situation. In particular, many young intellectuals who have not undergone practical training should go down to train for two or three years, or even longer. All those who stay at home to teach should also go down for two or three months each year, go deep into the workers and peasants, and strengthen their research on practical problems and frequently investigate and study the students' thinking in peacetime. Only in this way can the phenomenon of teaching work being divorced from reality be gradually overcome. Only in this way can we gradually cultivate a competent teaching team for Marxist-Leninist theory courses.

According to the approval of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Party committees at all levels will strengthen their leadership over the socialist education curriculum in the future, pay attention to the training and assistance of teachers, and specifically study the teaching situation of this curriculum. This will surely have a huge impact on teaching this curriculum well. All comrades who are engaged in the teaching of Marxist-Leninist theory courses must recognize that Marxist-Leninist theory courses are all courses that are closely integrated with reality, and are all fighting courses that use proletarian ideology to overcome bourgeois ideology. They must be carried out under the leadership and assistance of Party committees and school Party committees at all levels in order to achieve good results.

Finally, due to the different situations in various regions and schools, the socialist education curriculum has already begun in some schools, can be partially started in some schools, and will have to be started in other schools after a period of time. In particular, the current rectification movement in colleges and universities is in the stage of rectifying work styles and improving work in some places, and will soon enter this stage in others. Therefore, the socialist education curriculum must be carried out in conjunction with rectification tasks. In this stage, some documents can be designated for reading, and special discussions can also be appropriately launched in order to achieve the purpose of improving students' ideological awareness in conjunction with the rectification. In addition, all schools that have not yet started this curriculum should actively publicize the significance of the socialist education curriculum, correct the various erroneous views of teachers and students on this curriculum, and organize teachers of theoretical courses to earnestly prepare for the teaching of this curriculum (including reading documents, studying students' thinking, and systematically refuting various right-wing fallacies and bourgeois ideological viewpoints). This is essential for the smooth unfolding of the study of this curriculum in the future.

专栏：

    编者注：中共中央宣传部关于设立社会主义教育课程的报告和中共中央的批示公布以后，受到了普遍的欢迎，认为是理论联系实际、提高知识分子的社会主义觉悟、推进思想战线上社会主义革命的有效措施。同时，也有一些人对于这个措施的重大意识认识不足，加以设立这样的课程缺乏经验，工作中确实存在一些问题。这里转载的是学习杂志关于这个问题的两篇社论，第一篇是在12月3日出版的该刊1957年第二十三期上发表的，第二篇将在12月18日出版的该刊1957年第二十四期上发表。
　　怎样认识“社会主义教育课程”？
    中共中央对中央宣传部“关于设立社会主义教育课程的报告”的批示（已在上期本刊发表），对于我国当前马克思列宁主义教育工作来说，有着极重要的意义。
    为什么要设立社会主义教育课程呢？这是因为我国正进行着政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，人人都要过社会主义这一关。中央宣传部在“报告”中说，设立这一课程，是为了“改造知识分子的旧思想，提高学员的社会主义觉悟”。大放大鸣和反右派斗争阶段中的大量事实证明，知识分子的旧思想如果不经过改造，就不仅不能很好地为社会主义服务，甚至还会被资产阶级右派所俘虏，作出不利于人民的坏事来。目前，反右派斗争虽然已经取得了决定性的胜利，但是，这并不是说，知识分子头脑中的资产阶级的政治思想影响，已经完全清除了。事情并不如此简单。经过了反右派斗争，绝大多数知识分子和干部虽然都已经认清了右派分子反对社会主义、反对共产党的反动政治立场，并对他们的反动言行表示了极大的愤慨，但是，对于右派分子所散布的许多资产阶级观点，例如，攻击社会主义的道路，攻击共产党的领导，攻击无产阶级专政，攻击民主集中制和国际主义等方面的谬论，其错误何在，有不少的人却还弄不清楚，或不能完全弄清楚。另外，知识分子当中存在的个人主义、本位主义、自由主义、无政府主义、平均主义和反动的民族主义等资产阶级思想，还需要很长的时期才会得到根本的改造。所以，在反右派斗争获得胜利的基础上，在高等学校学生、全党中级以上干部、国家机关、军队和企业的主要干部和知识分子中间，组织这一课程的学习，是完全必要的。这一学习，实际上就是政治战线和思想战线上社会主义革命的一个组成部分。
    有人认为，设立社会主义教育课程，是临时性的措施，只是为了“配合当前的运动”。他们认为，这门课程对于学习马克思列宁主义理论，是并不重要的，甚至认为这门课程“不是理论”，“没有系统性”，认为学习这门课就会“耽误马克思列宁主义的理论学习”。这些论调，都是极端错误的。从这些论调看来，这些同志对于“什么是理论”和“为什么要学习理论”这样根本性的问题，至今还是没有弄清楚的。毛泽东同志指出，“真正的理论在世界上只有一种，就是从客观实际抽出来又在客观实际中得到了证明的理论，没有任何别的东西可以称得起我们所讲的理论”。他又说过，对于马克思主义的理论，“精通的目的全在于应用”，他说，“我们所要的理论家是什么样的人呢？是要这样的理论家，他们能够依据马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，正确地解释历史中和革命中所发生的实际问题，能够在中国的经济、政治、军事、文化种种问题上给予科学的解释，给予理论的说明。”设立社会主义教育课程，正是为了使人们结合当前我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的实践，来学习马克思列宁主义的理论。这样的学习方法，能够最有效地帮助人们学会如何正确地运用马克思列宁主义的理论武器，为什么有些人反而认为它会“耽误”对理论的学习呢？这种对于“理论”的错误认识，早在1942年整风运动的时候就遭到严肃的批判了。到现在仍然持着这些论调的同志，必须认真阅读毛泽东同志“整顿党的作风”这篇文章，并且认真检讨自己对于理论的错误的看法，否则，他们必然走上错误的道路，他们的理论学习，是不会产生任何实际效果的。
    有着上述这些错误观点的同志，他们把社会主义教育课程，看得远不如其它马克思列宁主义理论课程来得重要。这也是极端错误的。我们认为，在马克思列宁主义的几门基本理论课程当中，如果不先学好社会主义教育这一门课程，就根本谈不到学好其它各门课程。我们知道，马克思列宁主义，并不是什么学院中的产品，也不是供人作为炫学之用的工具，它是无产阶级的战斗武器。它和自然科学或技术知识一类的没有阶级性的东西完全不同，要学习并掌握这一门科学，只有决心站在社会主义和无产阶级立场上的人，才能够做到。一切从资产阶级和小资产阶级出身的人，如果不愿意下决心走社会主义的道路，并且下决心改造自己的旧思想，就绝对不能学好马克思列宁主义理论。事实证明，马克思列宁主义理论课程，对于那些坚持资产阶级小资产阶级立场的人，总是格格不入、学不进去的。他们虽然有时候也参加马克思列宁主义课程的学习，甚至还满口马克思列宁主义的辞句，但是，实际上，这不过是装装样子罢了。除了这些人以外，另外也还有些人，他们虽然确实想学好马克思列宁主义理论，但是，由于他们在学习当中不联系实际，不联系自己的思想，收效也很微薄。现在，这门社会主义教育课程，首先就是为了联系实际地解决人们的社会主义的立场问题，无产阶级立场问题。对于已经解决了无产阶级立场问题的人，这门课程就是为了帮助他们正确认识当前社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的重大问题，进一步提高他们的社会主义觉悟。所以，一切愿意走社会主义道路的人，一切具有学好马克思列宁主义理论的愿望的人，都必须首先以十分认真的态度，学好这一门课程。
    怎样才能把这门课程学好呢？中央宣传部在“报告”中说，“学习的方法：应该精读文件，又进行自由的和充分的讨论。”此外，理论课程教员和辅导员，还应该密切结合学员的思想，进行必要的讲授和辅导。精读文件，理解文件的基本内容，就是为了掌握武器，用来研究实际问题和改造思想。自由的和充分的讨论，也即是在学习理论的过程中，充分发扬“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的精神，展开大辩论，达到弄清是非、提高认识的目的。在讨论中必须让大家畅所欲言，并且必须摆事实，讲道理，坚持以理服人的方针。自然，这样的学习方法，和过去的理论课程教学方法是不同的，有些理论课程教员感到没有成规可循，并因而感到很大的困难。我们认为，困难是有的，但是，决不是不能克服的。我们必须首先看到，毛泽东同志的著作和这门课程所规定阅读的其他许多文件，都是理论和实际结合的最好典范，和当前革命实际有密切的联系。此外，在不久以前的反右派斗争中，揭露了大量的右派分子的反党反社会主义的言论，这就有可能使辩论的内容十分丰富。这都是教好这门课程的最有利的条件。至于“没有成规可循”，这似乎是一个缺点，但也未必不是一个优点。因为，在过去几年的马克思列宁主义理论课教学工作当中，虽然也创造了许多经验，取得了很大的成绩，但是，在一定范围内，也还存在着某些死背书本，不联系实际、不注意改造思想的倾向，在许多教员的教学当中，还存在着一种毫不了解学生思想情况、死背讲稿、喜欢在名词概念中兜圈子和单纯灌输的倾向。为了发挥马克思列宁主义的战斗精神，发挥它的生动活泼的精神，必须坚决纠正过去工作中的缺点，坚决贯彻理论和实际结合的方针。为了达到这个目的，我们还应该认真研究并适当运用过去革命根据地的理论教学中的好经验，运用整风运动中获得的经验，并且努力摸索和创造出适合当前情况的新的经验来。
    教员的工作，在教好这门课程当中，是起着决定性作用的。因此，必须组织优秀的理论课教员来担任这一课程的教学工作。近几年以来，我们已经组织了一支马克思列宁主义理论课程的教员队伍，这方面的成绩是不能否定的。但是，这支队伍还需要大大加强和提高。除了右派分子和实在不宜于担任这一工作的人，应当调离之外，这支队伍中的来自老干部的教员，还必须在今后几年当中，加强学习理论知识，出身于青年知识分子的教员，很多人还必须首先改造自己的阶级立场，到农村和工厂中去，大大加强自己的思想的锻炼。所有的教员，为了改进自己的工作，都必须加强对实际情况的理解。特别是许多没有经过实际锻炼的青年知识分子，应该下去锻炼两三年，或更长的时间。所有留在家里教课的人，每人每年也必须下去两三个月，深入工农群众，并且在平时加强对实际问题的研究，经常调查研究学员的思想情况。只有这样，教学工作的脱离实际的现象才能够逐渐克服。也只有这样，才能够逐步培养出一支胜任的马克思列宁主义理论课程的教学队伍来。
    根据中共中央的批示，今后各级党委都将加强对社会主义教育课程的领导，注意对教员的培养和帮助，并且具体研究这一课程的教学情况。这对于教好这门课程，必将发生巨大的作用。一切担任马克思列宁主义理论课程教学工作的同志，都必须认识：马克思列宁主义理论课程，都是和实际密切结合的课程，都是以无产阶级思想克服资产阶级思想的充满战斗性的课程，必须在各级党委和学校党委的领导和帮助之下进行，才能获得良好的效果。
    最后，由于各地区和各种学校情况的不同，社会主义教育课程在有些学校中，现在已经开始进行了，有些学校可以部分地开始进行，有的学校还要再过一个时期才能开始进行。特别是目前高等学校中的整风运动，有的正处在整顿作风、改进工作的阶段，有的即将进入这一阶段，因此，社会主义教育课程，必须结合整改任务来进行。在这一阶段中，可以指定阅读一部分文件，也可以适当展开专题讨论，以便结合整改的进行，达到提高学生思想觉悟的目的。此外，各校凡是没有开始进行这一课程的，都应该积极宣传社会主义教育课程的意义，纠正教员和学生对这一课程的各种错误看法，组织理论课程的教员，认真做好这门课程的教学准备工作（包括阅读文件，研究学生的思想，有系统地驳斥各种右派的谬论和资产阶级的思想观点等），这对于今后顺利地展开这一课程的学习，是十分必要的。
