    A Glimpse of Labor at Dongfeng No. 1 Middle School
    Sweeping the Streets
    In Northeast China after November, the temperature is usually ten degrees below zero. On Wednesday and Saturday mornings, before the last stars have faded, the students of Dongfeng No. 1 Middle School are already densely packed on the streets. Everyone is wholeheartedly sweeping the streets. Although it is not yet dawn, the students never overlook those drainage ditches, corners of walls, and places that people don't pay attention to.
    The street sweeping labor started from National Day this year and has continued until now.
    Collecting Manure
    In the past, the students of No. 1 Middle School would avoid manure when they saw it, especially the female students, who would feel nauseous and want to vomit when a manure cart passed by them.
    Since the school strengthened labor education for the students, everyone has realized the great significance of physical labor. In addition to actively participating in sweeping the streets, they also actively participate in collecting manure.
    Now, each class has a manure pile, and after meals, students go out in groups of two or three with baskets and shovels to collect manure. Female students are as active as male students in collecting manure, and they no longer hold their noses when they see manure.
    According to incomplete statistics, the whole school collected more than 100,000 catties of manure in just one week.
    Gathering Firewood
    In order to save on firewood for the stove and reduce school expenses, the students gathered a lot of firewood on Saturday afternoons and Sundays. From the beginning of November until now, they have gathered more than 4,000 bundles, solving the school's problem of firewood for the stove in winter.
    Some of this firewood was cut from thirty miles away, some was collected from the deep mountains and wilderness, and some was picked up by the students on their way to school.

    东丰一中劳动小景
    扫大街
    11月后的东北，气温通常都在零下十来度。一到星期三、星期六的早晨，残星未落，东丰第一中学的同学们早就密集在街道上。每个人都在一心一意地清扫街道。虽然天还没亮，可是，那些阴沟、墙角，不被人们注意的地方，学生们从来不放过。
    扫大街的劳动，从今年国庆节就开始了，一直继续到现在。
    拣粪
    过去，一中同学们看到粪都要绕道走，尤其是女同学更严重，当粪车从她们身边过去的时候，都要恶心的要吐。
    自从学校加强对同学们的劳动教育后，大家都认识到体力劳动的伟大意义。他们除积极参加扫大街外，还积极参加拣粪。
    现在，各班都有粪堆，学生在饭后，就三三两两的抬筐、拿锹去拣粪了。女同学和男同学一样积极拣粪，看到粪再也不堵鼻子了。
    据不完全统计，仅一周时间全校拣粪就达十万斤以上。
    打柴
    为了节省引炉柴，节省学校开支，同学们在星期六午后和星期天，打了很多引炉柴。从11月初到现在打了四千多捆，解决了学校冬季引炉柴的问题。
    这些引炉柴有的是从三十里外割来的，有的是从深山旷野采来的，有的是同学们上学拣的。
