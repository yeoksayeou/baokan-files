　　Some Agricultural Cooperatives in Linxiang County are Extravagant and Wasteful
　　Building Auditorium Delays Production
    The Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Wenbai Township, Linxiang County, Hunan Province, used 2,737 yuan to build a magnificent auditorium. The construction plan was initially requested from Secretary Zhang of the Township Party Committee in person, but the initial plan was very small, only to build two rooms, totaling no more than 500 yuan. Afterwards, the cooperative director Deng Xuechu and branch secretary Shen Daoshen thought: "A long pain is worse than a short one, if we are going to build, we should build a decent house, what does a bigger one matter?" So they expanded the plan into a building more than two zhang high (about 20 feet). The building used bricks and tiles that were specially fired in five kilns, worth 786 yuan, 289 pieces of timber, and mobilized more than 1,200 man-days of labor. The total cost was more than 2,700 yuan, accounting for about 6% of the cooperative's total income of 47,000 yuan. The total labor points of the cooperative this year was more than 320,000, and the construction of the auditorium accounted for 3.7%.
    The construction of the auditorium seriously affected production. In the second production team, five oxen had only one plow, and four plows were being repaired by carpenters. Because the carpenters were building the auditorium, they could not spare the labor to repair the plows, so four oxen were idle and could not be used. Looking at the whole cooperative: 3,000 man-days were needed for water conservancy projects, but work had not even started; only 3,700 dan of the 110,000 dan of manure accumulation task had been completed; 210 mu of the more than 800 mu of fields had not been plowed, and 120 mu of buckwheat had not been harvested... What a great loss! At the same time, due to the construction of the auditorium, the late rice was not cultivated well, resulting in a reduction of more than 10,000 jin.
    Due to the influence of the Wuxing Cooperative, the Sihe Cooperative, the Xingfu Cooperative, the Meichi Cooperative, the Quanyuan Cooperative, and the Xinsheng Cooperative also requested to build auditoriums.

    Too Much Money Spent on Opera Costumes
    The Qicheng Agricultural Cooperative in Wenbai Township established a Xiang Opera troupe in May, led by cooperative director Liu Hancheng, Supervisory Committee director Xiao Fusheng (a Party member), and storekeeper Liu Qitai, and absorbed members from two cooperatives, Quanyuan and others, to participate. After the troupe was established, it went to Hankou to buy more than 100 yuan worth of costumes. In June, it ordered a batch of opera costumes from Tongcheng County, Hubei Province, worth more than 600 yuan. At the same time, it hired an opera teacher at a daily wage of 1.5 yuan. In this way, the cooperative spent more than 850 yuan on this opera troupe, which is 107% more than the annual administrative management fee. They organized the troupe without passing it through the members' representative assembly or requesting instructions, and arbitrarily squandered the members' money. This practice is wrong and harms the interests of the members. The Linxiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China has dealt with this matter after learning about it.
    A serious unhealthy trend of extravagance and waste is currently growing in Linxiang County. The Meichi Cooperative in Wenbai Township also bought 180 yuan worth of new opera costumes; many cooperatives use public accumulation funds to book movie screenings. According to preliminary understanding, the Gaofeng Cooperative and Daqian Cooperative in Yanglousi Township, the Shaping Cooperative and Maotian Cooperative in Taolin Township, and the Xinsheng Cooperative, Zawu Cooperative, and Daba Cooperative in Liuchang Township all use public accumulation funds to book movie screenings. Of course, I am not opposed to watching movies, but using public accumulation funds to book movie screenings is not in line with the principle of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily.

    Manure Accumulation Also Has Formalism
    Not long ago, I took a walk in the countryside of Linqing County, Shandong Province, and saw that agricultural cooperatives everywhere were working day and night to vigorously carry out water conservancy construction. For example, the members of the Dongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Zhaosanli Township, Laoguanzhai District, which I passed through, were enthusiastically working to complete the digging of 150 wells this winter and next spring. However, the only fly in the ointment is that the manure accumulation work in this township and the other four or five villages I passed through was not done well. There was a lot of human feces, dog feces, and livestock manure by the roadside that no one picked up. Toilets in the villages were also equipped with urine buckets for accumulating urine fertilizer, but the urine in the buckets had already overflowed and flowed all over the ground unattended. Many places outside the villages also had some pits dug, and were marked with the words "×× Production Team (or Group) Manure Accumulation Pit", but in fact there was nothing in the pits.
    In order to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest next year, water conservancy must be done well, but it will not work to have water without fertilizer! Therefore, I suggest that agricultural cooperatives in these places should not ignore the work of accumulating manure, and should not turn manure accumulation into formalism. Li Zhongjun

### 临湘县有些农业社铺张浪费

　　临湘县有些农业社铺张浪费
　　盖礼堂耽误生产
    湖南省临湘县文白乡五星农业社，以二千七百三十七元资金修盖了一个富丽堂皇的大礼堂。这个修盖计划曾向乡党委会张书记当面作了请示，但当时的计划很小，只盖两间房子，总共还不超过五百元，事后社主任邓学初和支部书记沈道申认为：“长痛不如短痛，要盖就要盖个像样子的房子，大点子算什么？”于是将计划扩大成高二丈多的楼房。这座楼房光用的砖和瓦就专门烧了五窑，价值七百八十六元，木材二百八十九根，调用民工一千二百多工，全部费用达二千七百多元，占全社总收入四万七千元的6％左右。全社今年劳动总工分三十二万多分，修礼堂就占了3.7％。
    由于修礼堂严重地影响了生产。第二生产队，五条牛只有一张犁，有四张犁让木匠修。木匠因盖大礼堂不能抽工修犁，因此四条牛空着不能用。从全社来看：水利工程共要三千个工，根本未动工，十一万担积肥任务只积了三千七百担，八百多亩田中还有二百一十亩板田未犁，一百二十亩荞麦未收……这是多大的损失啊！同时由于修盖大礼堂，晚稻没有培育好，减产了一万多斤。
    由于五星社的影响，四合社、幸福社、梅池社、泉源社、新胜社也都要求修盖大礼堂。
    置戏装花钱太多
    文白乡齐城农业社，今年5月以社主任刘汉成、监委主任肖甫生（党员）保管员刘其太为首成立了一个湘剧团，并吸收了泉源等两个社社员参加。剧团成立后就到汉口买来一百多元的行头。6月份又到湖北通城县订了一批戏装，共值六百多元，同时还请了一个唱戏的师父，每天工资一元五角。这样，全社共为这个戏班子支出了八百五十多元，比全年的行政管理费还要大107％。他们组织剧团既不经社员代表大会通过，又不请示报告，拿上社员的钱任意挥霍浪费，这种作法是错误的，是危害社员利益的行为。中共临湘县委得知这事以后，已作了处理。
    临湘县目前正滋长着一种严重的铺张浪费的歪风。文白乡梅池社也买了一百八十元的唱戏新装；不少社用公积金包场看电影。据初步了解，羊楼司乡的高峰社、大前社，桃林乡的沙坪社、毛田社，柳厂乡的新生社，杂屋社、圫坝社，都用公积金包场看电影。当然我不是反对看电影，但是，用公积金包场看电影是不符合勤俭办社方针的。

    积肥也有形式主义
    不久以前，我到山东省临清县农村走了一转，看到各地农业社正在夜以继日的大力兴修水利。例如我走过的老官寨区兆三里乡东光农业社的社员们正在为完成今冬明春打井一百五十眼而热情地劳动着。但是，美中不足，这个乡和我路过的其它四五个村庄的积肥工作却搞的不好，野外路旁有不少的人粪、狗粪、牲畜粪没有人拣。村子里的厕所为了积尿肥也都设置了尿桶，但桶里的尿早已冒出来流满地无人过问。村外许多地方也挖了一些坑，并且还标着“××生产队（或组）积肥坑”的字样，其实坑里什么都没有。
    为了争取明年农业大丰收，水利一定是要搞好的，但是，有水无肥也不行呀！所以，我建议这些地方的农业社不要忽视了积肥工作，不要把积肥搞成形式主义。　李仲俊
