　　On the Nutritional Value of Spinach
　　Wang Huaizhou
    Spinach is a popular vegetable that grows both in the South and the North, and is available year-round in many places.

    However, opinions differ on the actual nutritional value of spinach. Let's start by analyzing its main nutritional components: Although 93% of spinach is water, one *jin* (approximately 500g) of spinach contains 9 grams of protein; this means that one *jin* of spinach contains roughly the same amount of protein as one and a half eggs. Spinach provides one-tenth of the daily requirement of Vitamin B1, one-third of the daily requirement of Vitamin B2, and one-seventh of the daily requirement of Nicotinic acid. Spinach is particularly rich in carotene (which can be converted into Vitamin A in the body) and Vitamin C. One *jin* of spinach contains 13.3 milligrams of carotene, and eating just five to six *liang* (approximately 250-300g) of spinach a day can meet our daily Vitamin A needs. The Vitamin C content in one *jin* of spinach is equivalent to that in one and a half *jin* of oranges, seven *jin* of apples, or eleven *jin* of pears.

    Spinach also contains minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, and iron, which are essential for the human body. Iron is a necessary substance for blood formation, and one *jin* of spinach contains 11.3 milligrams of iron. However, scientists' test results vary regarding the extent to which the human body utilizes iron. Some say that only 20% of the iron can be utilized by the body, while others say that 60% can be utilized. In addition, it is worth noting that although spinach contains a lot of calcium (one *jin* of spinach contains 315 milligrams), it cannot be utilized by the human body. This is because spinach contains a substance called oxalic acid (which has an astringent taste). Oxalic acid easily combines with calcium to form an insoluble substance (calcium oxalate), which the intestinal wall cannot absorb and is excreted through the stool. But does the oxalic acid in spinach affect the utilization of calcium in other foods? Some people have experimented with feeding infants and found that the calcium retention in the body when not eating spinach was 35% of the intake, while the calcium retention decreased to 27% when eating spinach. From this experiment, we can see that the oxalic acid in spinach does affect calcium utilization, but not very seriously.

    So, is there any way to remove the oxalic acid in spinach? Someone once experimented by boiling spinach in water for three minutes and found that 60% of the oxalic acid dissolved in the soup, while very little calcium dissolved in the soup. This can also remove its astringent taste.

    In summary, spinach is a nutritious and inexpensive popular vegetable. The only drawback is that it contains a large amount of oxalic acid, which affects the utilization of its calcium content by the human body. However, as long as the cooking method of spinach is improved, the adverse effects of oxalic acid can be greatly reduced.

　　谈谈菠菜的营养价值
　　王淮洲
    菠菜是一种大众化的蔬菜，南方、北方都能生长，许多地方一年四季都能吃到。
    但是菠菜的营养价值到底怎样呢？认识却有不同。现在，让我们先分析它所含的主要营养成分：菠菜中虽然93％的物质是水分，但一市斤菠菜中也含有蛋白质9克；这就是说，一斤菠菜与一个半鸡蛋中所含的蛋白质正相当。菠菜供给的维生素乙1相当于人体一日需要量的十分之一，维生素乙2相当一日需要量的三分之一，尼克酸相当一日需要量的七分之一。菠菜中所含的胡萝卜素（在人体内可转化为维生素甲）和维生素丙特别丰富。一斤菠菜含胡萝卜素13.3毫克，每天只要吃上五到六两菠菜，就可以满足我们一天所需要的维生素甲量。一斤菠菜中维生素丙的含量可以抵上一斤半橘子、七斤苹果或十一斤梨中所含的量。
    菠菜中也含有人体所需要的钙、磷、铁等矿物质。铁是构成血液所必需的物质，一斤菠菜中含铁11.3毫克。但就人体对铁质的利用程度来讲，各个科学家的试验结果不尽相同，有的人说只有20％的铁质可被人体利用，有的人说60％能被人体利用。另外，值得我们注意的，是菠菜中虽然含有很多钙质（一斤菠菜含315毫克），但却不能被人体利用。因为菠菜中含有一种叫作草酸（发涩味）的物质，草酸很容易同钙质结合成一种不溶解的物质（草酸钙），肠壁不能吸收，而由大便排出。但菠菜所含的草酸是否会影响到其他食物中钙质的利用呢？有人曾以吃奶的婴儿作过试验，证明不吃菠菜时，钙在体内的存留量为食入量的35％；吃菠菜时，则钙的存留量降为27％。由这个试验可以知道，菠菜中的草酸的确可以影响钙的利用，但并不十分严重。
    那么，菠菜中的草酸有没有办法去掉呢？有人曾经作过试验，把菠菜在水中煮三分钟，有60％的草酸溶在汤内，而钙质溶在汤内的则很少，同时也可以将它的涩味去掉。
    总起来说，菠菜是一种营养丰富而价廉的大众化的菜蔬；美中不足的，是由于它含有多量草酸，影响到它所含的钙质不能被人体利用。但是，只要改善一下菠菜的烹调方法，草酸的不良影响就可大大减少。
