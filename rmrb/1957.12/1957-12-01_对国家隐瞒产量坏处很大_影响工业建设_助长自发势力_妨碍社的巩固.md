Concealing Production from the State is Very Harmful
Affects Industrial Construction, Encourages Spontaneous Forces, and Hinders the Consolidation of the Commune
    This newspaper reports that Xingning and Meixian counties in Guangdong Province recently conducted a struggle among cadres against concealing and wasting grain. Before the late rice harvest, Xingning and Meixian counties convened three-level cadre meetings. When discussing the grain issue, many cadres revealed thoughts that contradicted the state's grain policy, the most prominent being dissatisfaction with the principle of "public before private." Consequently, many cadres deceived the state and concealed grain. To address this, the county committees of both counties decided to launch a struggle against concealing and wasting grain during the meetings. As a result, many erroneous behaviors, such as concealing land, underreporting yields, overreporting population, and exaggerating disaster conditions, were exposed. Because farmers had too much grain in hand, a large amount of grain was wasted and illegal activities occurred, such as brewing wine, making noodles, and privately buying and selling grain coupons. The two counties combined concealed and wasted three to four million jin of grain from the early crop this year. According to statistics from Xingning County cadres, 37.4% of the county's 622 communes had concealed production; 41% had instances of production teams privately dividing grain and other cases of theft and embezzlement; and 600 households of commune members were brewing private wine.
    Through vigorous debate, the cadres present clarified right and wrong, improved their ideological understanding, and established the concept of "public before private." Those who originally had erroneous thoughts, after recognizing their mistakes, were able to seriously expose and examine past behaviors that harmed the interests of the state; some cadres even used their own self-criticisms to enlighten and help others understand the ideology. At the meeting, everyone realized that concealing production was very harmful: first, it affected socialist industrialization; second, it encouraged the activities of capitalist spontaneous forces and affected the consolidation of the commune; third, because of the deceptive actions, mutual suspicion among cadres within the commune increased, affecting the commune's unity; and fourth, cadres' participation in illegal activities further reduced their prestige, making it impossible to lead. Many cadres remorsefully reflected, "We were confused in the past, and we let down the Party. We will resolutely correct our mistakes in the future." They also happily expressed that this year's late crop would definitely implement simultaneous harvesting, delivery, and sale of grain, and that next year they would produce more grain to support industrial construction.

　　对国家隐瞒产量坏处很大
　　影响工业建设　助长自发势力　妨碍社的巩固
    本报讯　广东兴宁、梅县两县最近在干部中间进行了反对隐瞒、浪费粮食的斗争。晚稻收获前夕，兴宁、梅县两县分别召开了三级干部会议。在讨论粮食问题时，许多干部暴露出同国家粮食政策相抵触的思想，最突出的是不满意“先公后私”的原则。不少干部并因此而欺骗国家，隐瞒粮食。为此，两县的县委都决定在会议中开展一次反对隐瞒粮食和浪费粮食的斗争。这样，许多错误行为，如隐瞒土地，少报产量，多报人口，夸大灾情都被揭露出来。农民由于有了过多的粮食在手，便又发生了大量浪费粮食和违法的行为，如酿酒、制粉条、私自买卖粮票等。两县合计，今年早造被隐瞒浪费的粮食就有三、四百万斤，据兴宁县干部统计：全县六百二十二个社中，有隐瞒产量行为的社占37.4％；发生生产队私分和其他盗窃贪污情况的占41％；酿制私酒的社员六百户。
    通过大辩论，到会干部分清了是非，提高了思想水平，树立了先公后私的观念。原来有错误思想的人，认识转变后，都能认真揭发、检查过去损害国家利益的行为；有的干部还以自己检查出来的事实去启发别人，帮助别人弄通思想。会上，大家都认识到隐瞒产量行为害处很大：一，影响社会主义工业化；二，助长了资本主义自发势力的活动，影响社的巩固；三，因为作了欺骗的事，增加了社内干部互相怀疑，影响了社的团结；四，干部参加违法行为，更加降低威信，无法领导。许多干部沉痛地检讨说：“过去糊涂，对不起党，今后坚决改正。”并且愉快地表示今年晚造一定实行边收割边交粮卖粮，明年多打粮食，支援工业建设。
