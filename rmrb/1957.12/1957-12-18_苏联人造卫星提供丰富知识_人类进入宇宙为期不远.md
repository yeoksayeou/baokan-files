Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 17th: The moment when people hear the first human voice transmitted from space is now imminent, said Soviet Professor of Medicine Alekhin in a recent interview published in "Youth" magazine.

Alekhin said that the experiment with the dog "Laika" vividly demonstrated that living organisms can withstand the so-called mechanical shock of multi-stage rocket launches and the prolonged effects of acceleration when the satellite reaches orbit. The professor pointed out that Soviet scientists have mastered the methods of space medicine—biological research—and have produced very lightweight and portable instruments.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 17th: Soviet scientist Professor Pobedonostsev said in an article published in the recent issue of "Youth" magazine that the two Soviet artificial satellites have provided a lot of extremely valuable information, and the knowledge about the universe obtained from them in the past few weeks is more than what all of humanity has gained in the entire past.

Pobedonostsev also announced that there are now well-founded designs for flying to the moon and even to the planets of the solar system. The work being done by Soviet researchers in this area is bringing humanity closer to the realization date of this long-held fantasy of flying into space. The professor believes that it may be possible to fly to the moon in less than ten years.

When introducing the functions of artificial satellites, Pobedonostsev said that artificial satellites can help explain whether there are temperatures above 1,000 degrees Celsius in the upper atmosphere, why compasses are inaccurate at high altitudes, what geomagnetism actually is, and many other questions.

Using future satellites, it will be possible to study the surfaces of other planets in considerable detail—the "enigmatic" canals on Mars and the clouds on Venus, and to study the surfaces of the giant Jupiter and Saturn. Observations of the sun may confirm the hypothesis that the basic source of light is not the star itself, but the usually invisible corona. Astrophysicists will be able to unravel the secrets of ultra-high temperature stars and exploding stars, determine the atmospheric composition of other planets, and solve the question of whether there may be life on other planets, which is of concern to people.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 17th: The first flight to the moon or around the moon seems likely to be realized in the next year and a half to two years, said Stanyukovich, a member of the Interstellar Communications Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, in an article entitled "Lunar Flight is Possible" published in the recent Russian edition of "In Defense of Peace."

Stanyukovich said that if one or two more stages are added to modern ballistic rockets, the speed of the last stage of the rocket can reach about 12 kilometers per second. This is entirely sufficient to fly to the moon. Even if the instrument equipment of the artificial satellite launched to the moon is not perfect, as long as a strong modern explosive is installed in the satellite's head, the bright light of this explosion can be seen from the earth. The composition of the lunar surface can be understood through spectral analysis.

Professor Stanyukovich went on to say that launching a rocket that orbits the moon and can photograph the invisible part of the moon is particularly interesting. Professor Stanyukovich pointed out that, of course, it seems that we will not see any miracles there. The moon is not hospitable to the first guests. According to some scientists, there is a fairly thick layer of powdery substance on the lunar surface. People will have to wear a heavy space suit that is very strong and can prevent the constant cosmic dust that strikes the moon from piercing it. People are more likely to travel on the moon in a safe off-road armored vehicle. There is no doubt that in the future, the inhabitants of our earth will be able to create excellent observatories on the moon. The moon will become a base for future atomic research and an airport for spacecraft.

    苏联人造卫星提供丰富知识
    人类进入宇宙为期不远
    据新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：人们听到从宇宙传来的第一个人的声音的时刻，现在已经指日可待了，这是苏联阿列欣医学教授在最近一期“青春”杂志上发表谈话时说的。
    阿列欣说，用小狗“莱伊卡”进行的试验生动地证明，生物能够经受住多级火箭发射时的所谓力学冲击和在卫星飞到轨道上去的时候的加速度的长期作用。这位教授指出，苏联科学家已经掌握了宇宙医学——生物学研究的方法，制成了十分轻便的袖珍仪器。
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学家波别多诺斯切夫教授在最近一期“青春”杂志发表文章说，苏联两个人造卫星提供了很多极为珍贵的资料，最近几周内从它们那儿所获得的关于宇宙的知识比过去整个人类历史上所获得的还要多。
    波别多诺斯切夫还宣布说，现在已经有了有根据的、飞向月球乃至太阳系行星的设计。苏联研究人员在这方面所做的工作正在使人类很快地接近这个长时期以来的飞入宇宙的幻想的实现日期。这位教授认为，不出十年就有可能飞到月球上。
    波别多诺斯切夫在介绍人造卫星功用时说，人造卫星能够帮助说明，高层大气中是否有高于零上一千度的温度，为什么罗盘在高空中会不准确，地磁究竟是什么以及其他许多问题。
    利用未来的卫星就可能相当详细地研究其他行星的表面——火星上的“令人不解的”运河和金星上的云，研究巨大的木星和土星的表面。对于太阳的观察，将可能证实一种假说：基本光源不是这个恒星本身，而是通常看不见的日冕。天体物理学家们将能够揭开超高温的星和爆发的星的秘密，确定其他行星的大气组成和解决人们所关心的其他行星上是否可能有生命的问题。
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：第一次飞往月球或环绕月球的飞行看来可能在最近一年半到两年内即将实现，这是苏联科学院星际交通委员会委员斯塔纽科维奇在最近一期俄文版“保卫和平”杂志上发表的“月球飞行可能实现”一文中说的。
    斯塔纽科维奇说，如果现代弹道火箭再增加一、二级，那末火箭的最后一级的速度约可达到每秒钟十二公里。这样就完全足够飞向月球。即使发射到月球上的人造卫星的仪器装备不完善，但只要在卫星头部装有强烈的现代炸药，从地球上就可以看到这种爆炸的明亮的火光。通过光谱分析就可以了解月球表面的组成。
    斯塔纽科维奇教授接着说，发射环绕月球飞行并且可以把月球上看不见的那一部分拍摄下来的火箭，是特别令人感到兴趣的。斯塔纽科维奇教授指出，当然，看来我们在那里并不会看到什么奇迹。月球对于第一批客人是不殷勤的。据某些科学家推测，月球表面有相当厚的一层粉末状物质。人们将不得不穿着一种沉重的宇宙服，这种服装非常牢固，可以防止不断袭击月球的宇宙尘把它击穿。人们更可能会乘坐一种安全的越野装甲车在月球上行动。毫无疑问，将来我们地球上的居民一定能在月球上造成出色的天文台。月球将成为未来原子研究的基地和宇宙飞船的机场。
