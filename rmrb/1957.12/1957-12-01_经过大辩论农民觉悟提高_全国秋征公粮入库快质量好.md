　　After Great Debates, Peasants' Awareness Improves:
　　National Autumn Grain Tax Enters Granary Quickly with Good Quality

　　(Our Newspaper News) The national agricultural tax collection work is progressing well. Most provinces have entered the stage of transporting grain into storage, and some areas have just begun collection due to the later harvest season. According to statistics from twenty-two provinces and cities that have already started collecting, as of the end of October, 72% of the agricultural tax collection task has been completed. The progress of the collection work is generally twenty days to one month ahead of the same period last year.

　　This year, farmers are very enthusiastic about paying agricultural taxes because, after the extensive socialist debates, the political awareness of the farmers has been improved, and they have a further understanding of the relationship between national interests, collective interests, and individual interests. A member of the Sanlian Team of the Zhongxin Cooperative in Junxian County, Henan Province, said: "Last year we suffered a disaster, and if the state hadn't provided grain, we would have hardly survived. This year we have a good harvest, so we must pay good agricultural taxes." The entire cooperative paid off the agricultural tax it was supposed to pay in two days. The quality of this year's grain is also better than last year. In Xinyang Prefecture, Henan Province, the grain currently in storage is 30% to 50% first-class, 50% to 70% medium-class, and only 1% unqualified.

　　This year's grain collection methods have also been improved compared to last year. Most areas notify the agricultural cooperatives (households) of the amount of agricultural tax to be paid or the amount to be pre-paid in advance. The agricultural cooperatives (households) "collect, thresh, and deliver" at the same time, without waiting until the harvest is over to deliver in a concentrated manner. This closely integrates the collection of agricultural taxes with the income distribution of agricultural cooperatives, reducing the difficulties for cooperatives in storing and transporting agricultural taxes.

    经过大辩论农民觉悟提高
　　全国秋征公粮入库快质量好
    本报讯　全国公粮征收工作进展良好，大部省份已经进入运粮入库阶段，部分地区因收获季节较晚，刚开始征收。根据已经开征的二十二个省、市的统计，截至10月底止，公粮征收任务已经完成72％。征收工作进度一般比去年同时期提前了二十天到一个月。
    今年农民交纳公粮热情很高，因为经过广泛展开社会主义大辩论，农民的政治觉悟提高了，对于国家利益、集体利益和个人利益的关系，有了进一步的认识。河南省浚县中心社三联队社的社员说：“去年受灾，要不是国家供给粮食吃，生命也难保。今年丰收了，就得交好公粮”。全社应交的公粮，两天就交清了。今年的粮食质量，也比去年有所提高。河南省信阳专区目前入库的粮食，头等的占30％到50％，中等的占50％到70％，不合格的粮食只占1％。
    今年征粮的方法也比去年有了改进。绝大部分地区都事先通知农业社（户）应交公粮的数量或预交数量，农业社（户）“随收、随打、随交”，不用等到收获完了再集中送交。这使公粮的征收和农业社的收入分配密切配合起来，减少了合作社保管公粮及运输方面的困难。（刘志洁）
