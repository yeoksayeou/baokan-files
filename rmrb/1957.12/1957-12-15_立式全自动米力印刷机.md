    Vertical Automatic "Mili" Printing Press

    This newspaper reports: The repair workshop of the People's Daily Printing Plant, with the help of technicians from the Beijing People's Machinery Factory and the China Youth Daily Printing Plant, has recently successfully trial-manufactured and assembled a vertical automatic "Mili" printing press.

    This printing press can print multi-color copperplate octavo-sized pictorials and covers. Its greatest advantage is its high degree of automation. After starting, paper receiving, paper feeding, and cylinder rotation are fully automatic. During production, if obstacles such as incorrect paper feeding, incorrect color registration, or double sheet suction occur, the machine can automatically stop.

    All the components of this printing press are domestically produced. Judging from the more than 30,000 color covers it has already printed, the product quality is fully qualified.

    Manufacturing this type of printing press is a first in China, and its cost is only one-third of that of imported goods. (Hu Daoyuan) (Attached picture)

    立式全自动米力印刷机
    本报讯　人民日报印刷厂修配车间，最近在北京人民机器厂和中国青年报印刷厂的技术人员帮助下，试制和装配立式全自动米力印刷机成功。
    这种印刷机能够印刷多色铜版的八开画报和封面，它的最大优点是自动化程度较高，开动后，接纸、续纸、滚筒转动完全自动；在生产中，如果发生送纸不正、套色不正、吸双张纸等障碍，都能够自动停车。
    这台印刷机的所有部件，都是国产的。就它已经印出的三万多张彩色封面看，产品质量完全合格。
    制造这种印刷机在我国还是第一次，它的成本只有进口货的三分之一。　（胡道源）（附图片）
