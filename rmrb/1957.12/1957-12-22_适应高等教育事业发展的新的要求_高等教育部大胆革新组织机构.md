To adapt to the new requirements of the development of higher education, the Ministry of Higher Education has boldly reformed its organizational structure during the rectification campaign, creating favorable conditions for improving work and delegating cadres.

(Dispatch from our newspaper) The entire staff of the Ministry of Higher Education had been considering changing the organizational structure of the ministry for some time in order to meet the new demands of the development of higher education. When the rectification work of the Ministry of Higher Education began, the issue of organizational structure became one of the central issues of everyone's airing of views and sparked heated debate. The leaders of the Ministry of Higher Education promptly concentrated on studying the opinions of the masses, put forward a preliminary plan for the organizational structure, published it in the form of big-character posters, organized everyone to hold forums, special debate meetings, and full-scale debates to further expand the debate, and finally concentrated the opinions of the masses, studied and proposed a revised plan, and submitted it to the ministerial meeting for discussion and approval. Because the preparation and discussion before the ministerial meeting were relatively full and in-depth, the meeting was able to smoothly pass the new organizational structure plan. Now the Ministry of Higher Education has submitted this plan to the State Council for approval and is preparing to implement it after approval.

What principles did the Ministry of Higher Education mainly follow in this debate on changing the organizational structure? Most comrades in the ministry believe that, first, it is necessary to consider delegating some power to local authorities and universities, further implement the higher education policy of steady development, consolidation, and improvement, and redouble efforts to strengthen teaching and scientific research. Second, it is necessary to clarify the division of labor, reduce the number of tasks, reduce contradictions, better implement the principle of theory linking with practice, and overcome the three isms. Third, it is necessary to implement the spirit of streamlining institutions and reducing personnel.

According to the results of everyone's discussion, the new organizational structure is based on the principle of division of labor by business and specialized management. The Comprehensive University Education Department, the Industrial Education Department, the Scientific Research Department, the Teaching Guidance Department, and three independent sections were abolished. The Teaching and Scientific Research Department was established to be responsible for teaching, scientific research, teaching materials, spare-time education, sports, and other work. Other work is under the management of the Political Education Department, the Planning, Finance, and Capital Construction Department, the Student Management Department, the Cadre Management Department, the Foreign Cultural Liaison and International Student Management Department, the Secondary Vocational Education Department, and the General Office. In addition, in order to better assist the ministers in their work, a research office has been established; in teaching and scientific research, in order to pool ideas and follow the mass line, it is planned to establish a Teaching and Scientific Research Guidance Committee, inviting some university teachers to participate as a consulting body for the Ministry of Higher Education. In this way, the organizational structure of the Ministry of Higher Education has been changed from fifteen units to eight units.

After the announcement of the new organizational structure plan, the vast majority of comrades in the Ministry of Higher Education strongly supported it because the new organizational structure plan has the following advantages: First, according to the new division of labor, each unit is both a comprehensive department and a business department, which can not only uniformly accept tasks from higher authorities, but also comprehensively manage its own business according to the division of labor and be responsible to the end. Internally, externally, to higher authorities, and to lower levels, it is a single unit, which greatly reduces contradictions and disputes and is conducive to improving work efficiency and work quality. In the past, the division of labor in the institutions was mutually involved, and there were many contradictions, resulting in some phenomena such as mutual buck-passing, shirk responsibility, and multiple policies, which affected the work. After the change of the institution, each work is managed by only one department, which solves the contradictions between departments in the past. Ministers can also free themselves to strengthen the study and leadership of major issues within the ministry.

Second, the new institutions have the potential to greatly strengthen teaching and scientific research and facilitate the integration of theory with practice. In the past, because schools were in a period of vigorous rectification, reform, and development, it was necessary to establish various school management departments to comprehensively consider the adjustment, reform, and development of various types and individual schools. Today, the situation is different. Higher education is in a period of steady development, consolidation, and improvement. One of the urgent tasks in training cadres is to innovate and strengthen ideological and political education and improve the quality of teaching and scientific research. In this way, it is necessary and possible to set up a separate department for teaching and scientific research in order to concentrate efforts to strengthen the leadership of teaching and scientific research, formulate necessary rules and regulations, and change the past situation in which capital construction finance and personnel and other work in the school management department often squeezed out teaching and scientific research. Because each unit of the new organizational structure is fully responsible for the work it manages and is responsible to the end, it is not only easy to understand the situation, but also easy to make things that are in line with reality.

Third, due to the streamlining of institutions, it is possible to streamline some staff to support grassroots and agricultural construction.

However, in the debate, everyone felt that the new organizational structure was not perfect. The main concern was that it might relax or ignore the comprehensive understanding and unified research of the overall situation of each type of school and each school, as well as the different problems of various different schools. In order to remedy this shortcoming, the Teaching and Scientific Research Guidance Committee and the Research Office were established to be responsible for comprehensive research and other aspects of work, while strengthening the role of the General Office as the throat and link, and assisting the ministers in grasping the overall situation and liaison work.

### 适应高等教育事业发展的新的要求  高等教育部大胆革新组织机构

    适应高等教育事业发展的新的要求
    高等教育部大胆革新组织机构
    本报讯  高等教育部在整改高潮中，经过反复研究争辩，大胆地革新了组织机构，给改进工作、下放干部创造了有利条件。
    为了适应高等教育事业发展的新的要求，高等教育部的全体干部早就考虑过改变部的组织机构问题。当高等教育部整改工作一开始，组织机构问题便成为大家鸣放的中心问题之一，并且展开了热烈的争辩。高等教育部领导上适时地集中研究了群众的意见，提出了组织机构的初步方案，用大字报公布出来，组织大家开座谈会、专题辩论会和全部大辩论会，进一步展开争辩，最后又集中群众的意见，研究提出了修正方案，提请部务会议讨论通过。由于部务会议之前酝酿讨论比较充分、深入，所以会议得以顺利地通过了新的组织机构方案。现在高等教育部已将这个方案报请国务院批准，准备批准后实行。
    高等教育部在这次改变组织机构的争辩中，主要遵循些什么原则呢？部内大多数同志认为，首先，要考虑到下放一部分权力给地方和高等学校，进一步贯彻稳步发展、巩固提高的高等教育方针，百倍地加强教学和科学研究工作。其次，要明确分工，减少头绪，减少矛盾，更好地贯彻理论联系实际的原则，克服三个主义。第三，要贯彻精简机构、减少人员的精神。
    根据大家讨论的结果，新的组织机构是按业务分工、条条归口的精神设司的。取消了综合大学教育司、工业教育司、科学研究司、教学指导司和三个独立处。设立教学和科学研究司，负责教学、科学研究、教材、业余教育、体育等工作，其他工作分属政治教育司、计划财务基建司、学生管理司、干部管理司、对外文化联络与留学生管理司、中等专业教育司和办公厅管理。此外，为了更好地协助部长们工作，设立了研究室；在教学和科学研究上为了集思广益，走群众路线，准备成立教学与科学研究指导委员会，邀请部分高等学校教师参加，作为高等教育部的咨询机构。这样，高等教育部的组织机构从十五个单位改变为八个单位了。
    新的组织机构方案宣布后，高等教育部的绝大多数同志都是十分拥护的，因为新的机构方案有以下优点：第一，按照新的分工，各单位既是综合司，又是业务司，既能统一接受上级任务，又能按分工职掌全面管理自己的业务，负责到底。对内、对外、对上、对下都是一个单位，这样就大大地减少矛盾和纠纷，有利于提高工作效率和工作质量。过去的机构分工，各司间互相牵涉，矛盾很多，造成一些相互扯皮、推诿和政出多门等现象，影响工作。机构改变后，每件工作只有一个司来管，解决了过去司与司之间的矛盾。部长们也可以抽出身来，加强对部内重大问题的研究和领导。
    第二，新的机构有可能大大地加强教学和科学研究工作，便于理论联系实际。过去，由于学校处在大力整顿、改革和发展时期，有必要设立各类学校主管司来全面考虑各类和各个学校的调整、改革和发展。今天情况不同了，高等教育事业处在稳步发展、巩固提高时期，在培养干部方面迫切任务之一是革新和加强思想政治教育工作，提高教学和科学研究的质量。这样，就有必要也有可能把教学和科学研究工作单独设司，以便集中力量，加强对教学和科学研究工作的领导，制定必要的规章制度，改变过去学校主管司中基建财务和人事等工作常常挤掉教学和科学研究的情况。新的组织机构的各单位由于对自己所管理的工作全面负责，而且是负责到底，这样不仅便于了解情况，而且制定的东西也容易切合实际。
    第三，由于机构的精简，便有可能精简一部分工作人员去支援基层和农业建设。
    但是，在争辩中，大家感到新的组织机构也不是尽善尽美的，主要是对每一类学校和每个学校的全面情况以及各种不同学校的不同问题，可能会放松或忽视全面的了解和统一的研究。为了补救这个缺点，设立了教学与科学研究指导委员会和研究室，负责综合研究等方面的工作，同时加强办公厅的咽喉和纽带作用，协助部长们做好全面情况的掌握联络工作。  （广业）
