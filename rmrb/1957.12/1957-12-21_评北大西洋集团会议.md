    The high-level meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which began in Paris on December 16, concluded on the 19th. This meeting and the communique issued at its conclusion show that the American aggressive bloc is trying to resist the rising tide of peace and strengthen its arms expansion and war preparations. At the same time, facing the powerful forces of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union and the pressure of world public opinion demanding peace, the North Atlantic Group is fraught with internal contradictions, which have created many difficulties for the American war plan.
    The high-level meeting of the North Atlantic Group was held under conditions very unfavorable to the American aggressive bloc. Not long ago, the meeting of communist and workers' parties in Moscow and the successful launch of the Soviet artificial earth satellite showed that the strength of socialism exceeded that of imperialism, and that the East Wind prevailed over the West Wind. The declaration of the meeting of communist and workers' parties clearly put forward the proposition of peaceful coexistence and the resounding slogan of "Give Peace to the World." Since then, the Soviet government has taken a series of significant peaceful diplomatic actions, calling on governments and parliaments of all countries to stop the arms race, stop the threat of war, and peacefully coexist between countries with different systems. All of this has had a strong impact on all countries in the world, and an unprecedentedly broad wave of demands for peace has risen in European countries. Even in the United States, more and more people are demanding a change in the current foreign policy. Because in the era of rapid development of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, no place in the world can avoid being hit in a new war; at the same time, any local military conflict between countries may escalate into a full-scale war in an instant. Therefore, the Western European countries located on the front line of the American strategy, including the ruling groups of these countries, cannot but consider their miserable fate once a war breaks out. The Americans far away across the Atlantic Ocean cannot feel safe in a war launched by the American aggressive bloc. To ease the current international tensions, to stop the arms race that will lead to war, and to eliminate the danger of nuclear war that is increasingly threatening the safety of people of all countries, has become the most urgent demand of all peace-loving people who do not want to suffer the devastating blow of nuclear weapons.
    However, the American aggressive bloc, representing the interests of some monopoly capital that seeks maximum profits from the arms race and colonial aggression, still closes its eyes and refuses to recognize the reality of the current world. They are trying to re-ignite a counter-current against peace. They are using the Soviet Union's great new achievements in science to create an artificial "sense of urgency" in order to re-intensify international tensions, further expand armaments, and prepare for atomic war. The just-concluded Paris meeting of the heads of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a concentrated manifestation of the American aggressive bloc's anti-peace efforts.
    This meeting was convened by the United States with the assistance of Britain. The purpose of the United States in convening this meeting was to: stop the serious disintegration trend that has occurred in the Western camp due to the fundamental changes in the situation, stabilize the greatly shaken American leadership; and force Western European countries to hand over more sovereignty and make greater sacrifices to serve the American aggressive war plan. The United States is determined to achieve its goals at this meeting. At the first day of the meeting, Eisenhower demanded that the United States implement "everything that is needed by the strategy." He rebuked the "nationalistic boastful feelings" of the Western European countries, demanded that they have "great will courage," and that they should "end" "disagreements between each other," and "give up smaller goals and interests." Dulles put forward a whole set of war preparations, including storing atomic weapons in Western Europe and establishing missile bases, coordinating the production of new weapons, and so on. However, the meeting began unexpectedly for the Americans. The situation of the balance of international forces and the call for peace from the people of all countries affected the attitude of the governments of Western European countries. Sharp divisions appeared between the continental European countries of the North Atlantic Group and the United States.
    At the beginning of the meeting, Eisenhower and Dulles refused to talk about the Soviet Union's peace proposals and tried to put the meeting into the orbit of the American original discussion of military deployment. However, the Soviet Union's loud calls for peace broke into the heavily guarded conference hall. Representatives from Norway, Denmark, Canada, the Netherlands, and even West Germany, one after another, advocated taking the Soviet Union's peace proposals seriously. British Prime Minister Macmillan advocated "negotiating under arms." The United States was under pressure from a united Europe and had to agree to temporarily add Bulganin's letter to the agenda. The meeting's communique shows that the United States was finally forced to agree to hold a foreign ministers' meeting with the Soviet Union to resolve the disarmament stalemate. The American aggressive bloc tried to turn Western Europe into an American missile war base at the meeting. The proceedings of the meeting show that representatives of many countries have reservations about establishing missile bases in Western Europe. The communique of the meeting only stipulates that the military authorities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will put forward "suggestions" for "consideration." People see that the United States' position at the meeting was far from satisfactory and as it wished. American and Western European bourgeois newspapers have done their utmost to curse each other during the meeting, fully reflecting the intensification of internal contradictions in the Western imperialist camp. This kind of contradiction and struggle cannot be covered up by any beautiful rhetoric that brags about Western "unity."
    However, people should see that the declaration and communique of the meeting used the largest amount of space to slander the Soviet Union's peace policy and to advocate strengthening the aggressive military power of the North Atlantic Group with nuclear weapons and missiles. This shows that American imperialism still stubbornly adheres to the "position of strength" policy that has long been bankrupt, and still adheres to the policy of the arms race. It agreed to negotiate with the Soviet Union, only to be forced to put a thin veil of peace on this unpopular policy to ease the opposition of the people of all countries and perfunctorily meet the demands of European countries, but in fact used the principled agreement on military deployment to entrap European countries. Deeper into the quagmire of the arms race and involved in a war that they did not want to be involved in.
    The communique of the meeting also expressed the "concern" of the participating countries about the situation in the Middle East, Africa and even Indonesia. The people of Asian and African countries must be vigilant, the Western colonialist group headed by American imperialism intends to further use the North Atlantic Treaty as a tool to deal with the national independence movement in the Asian and African regions.
    The Paris meeting of the heads of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was a meeting planned by American imperialism to promote the arms race and prepare for atomic war, and at the same time it was a meeting where internal contradictions of the imperialist group were intensified and the American power policy was increasingly losing ground. This meeting and the recent Moscow meeting of communist and workers' parties are a strong contrast. Contrary to the Paris meeting, the Moscow meeting was a meeting to strive for human progress and safeguard world peace, a meeting to support the national independence movements of all countries, and a meeting where the strength of communism was unprecedentedly united. The Paris meeting once again powerfully proved in a certain sense that the strength of socialism has surpassed that of imperialism, and the East Wind prevails over the West Wind.
    The results of the Paris meeting show that the people of the whole world must never relax their vigilance against the war conspiracy of American imperialism, and must unremittingly strive to safeguard world peace. As long as the people of all countries persevere in the cause of peace to the end, the American imperialist aggression plan will definitely be crushed. At the Paris meeting, the intensification of internal contradictions in the imperialist camp and the great difficulties encountered by the United States also illustrated this possibility. The current international situation is unprecedentedly favorable for the struggle for peace. Peace-loving people of all countries must continue to fight, completely shatter any anti-peace conspiracy of imperialism, and strive for lasting world peace.

### 评北大西洋集团会议

    评北大西洋集团会议
    从12月16日起在巴黎召开的北大西洋公约组织最高级会议已经在19日结束。这个会议和它闭幕时发表的公报表明，美国侵略集团力图抗拒日益高涨的和平浪潮，加强扩军备战，但与此同时，面对着以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的强大力量和世界各国要求和平的舆论压力，北大西洋集团内部矛盾百出，使美国的战争计划遭到了重重困难。
    北大西洋集团的最高级会议是在对美国侵略集团十分不利的情况下举行的。不久以前在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党的会议，和苏联人造地球卫星发射成功，显示了社会主义力量超过了帝国主义力量，东风压倒了西风。各国共产党和工人党会议的宣言，又明确地提出了和平共处的主张和
  “给世界以和平”的响亮的口号。在这以后，苏联政府又采取了一系列意义重大的和平外交行动，向世界各国政府和议会呼吁停止军备竞赛，制止战争威胁，不同制度的国家和平共处。这一切都在世界各国发生了强烈的影响，欧洲各国兴起了一个空前广泛的要求和平的浪潮。甚至在美国，也有越来越多的人要求改变现行的外交政策。因为在核武器和远程导弹迅速发展的时代，世界已经没有任何地方能够在一次新的大战中避免受到打击；同时，任何国家之间的局部性的军事冲突都可能在瞬息之间扩大成为全面战争。因此，位处美国战略前线的西欧各国，包括这些国家的统治集团在内，也不能不考虑战争一旦爆发时他们的可悲的遭遇。远处大西洋彼岸的美国人，也不可能在美国侵略集团发动的战争中感到安全。缓和目前国际紧张局势，停止会导致战争的军备竞赛，消除日益严重地威胁各国人民安全的核战争的危险，就成为一切爱好和平和不愿遭受核武器的毁灭性打击的人当前最紧迫的要求。
  但是，美国侵略集团，代表着一些从军备竞赛和殖民侵略中获取最大利润的垄断资本的利益，仍闭着眼睛不愿承认当前世界的现实。他们竭力想重新掀起一股反和平的逆流。他们利用苏联科学上的伟大新成就，力图造成一种人为的“紧急感”，以便重新加剧国际紧张局势，进一步扩充军备，准备原子战争。刚刚闭幕的北大西洋公约集团首脑巴黎会议，就是美国侵略集团的反和平努力的一个集中的表现。
    这次会议是美国在英国的参谋下召开的。美国召开这次会议的目的是：制止由于形势的根本变化而在西方阵营中发生的严重的分崩离析趋势，稳定大大动摇了的美国领导地位；迫使西欧国家交出更多主权，作出更大牺牲，来为美国的侵略战争计划服务。美国一心想在这个会议上达到它的目的。艾森豪威尔在第一天的会议上就要求实行美国“战略所需要作的一切事情”。他斥责西欧国家的“民族主义的自逞的情绪”，要求他们要有“巨大的意志勇气”，要“结束”“彼此间的分歧”，要“舍弃较小的目标和利益”。杜勒斯则提出了一整套的备战计划，其中包括在西欧的储存原子武器和建立导弹基地、统筹新式武器的生产等等。但是，会议一开始就出乎美国人的意料。国际力量对比的形势和各国人民要求和平的呼声，影响了西欧国家政府的态度。在北大西洋集团欧洲大陆国家和美国之间，出现了尖锐的分歧。
    艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯在会议开始时绝口不谈苏联的和平建议，力图把会议纳入美国原定的讨论军事部署的轨道。但是，苏联的响亮的和平呼吁打进了警卫森严的会议厅。挪威、丹麦、加拿大、荷兰以至西德的代表都一个接着一个主张认真对待苏联的和平建议。英国首相麦克米伦则主张“武装起来谈判”。美国受到了欧洲国家联合的压力，不得不同意把布尔加宁的信临时加入议程。会议的公报表明，美国终于被迫同意同苏联举行外长级会议来解决裁军问题的僵局。美国侵略集团在会议上力图把西欧变为美国的导弹战争基地。会议进行的情况说明，许多国家的代表对在西欧建立导弹基地采取保留的态度。会议的公报只规定由北大西洋公约组织军事当局提出“建议”以备“考虑”。人们看到，美国在会议中所处的地位远不是称心如意、为所欲为的。美国和西欧各国资产阶级报纸在会议过程中亟尽互相咒骂之能事，充分地反映出西方帝国主义阵营内部矛盾尖锐化。这种矛盾和斗争，不是任何吹嘘西方“团结”的漂亮辞句所能掩盖得住的。
    但是，人们应该看到，会议的宣言和公报用了最大量的篇幅诽谤苏联的和平政策并鼓吹用核武器和导弹来加强北大西洋集团的侵略军事力量。这说明美帝国主义仍然顽固地坚持早已破产了的“实力地位”政策，仍然坚持军备竞赛的政策。它赞成同苏联谈判，只是被迫给这种不得人心的政策披上一件薄薄的和平外衣，来缓和一下各国人民的反对，敷衍一下欧洲国家的要求，实际上却用关于军事部署的原则协议来套住欧洲国家。会议的这一结果包含着新的战争危险。尽管公报中关于军事部署的实施作了诸如“进行协商”和“有关国家同意”之类保留，但是欧洲国家既然同美国商定了原则的协议，这项协议也就有可能成为美国的工具，把西欧国家更深地拖进军备竞赛的泥淖，并卷入一场它们所不愿意被卷进去的战争之中。
    会议的公报还表示了参加国对中东、非洲以至印度尼西亚局势的“关心”。亚非各国人民必须提高警惕，以美帝国主义为首的西方殖民主义集团打算进一步运用北大西洋公约作为对付亚非地区民族独立运动的工具。
    北大西洋公约集团首脑巴黎会议，是美帝国主义策划推进军备竞赛和准备原子战争的会议，同时又是帝国主义集团内部矛盾激烈化，美国的实力政策日益失势的会议。这个会议和不久前举行的各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议是一个强烈的对照。同巴黎会议恰恰相反，莫斯科会议是争取人类进步和维护世界和平的会议，是支持各国民族独立运动的会议，是共产主义力量空前团结的会议。巴黎会议在一定意义上又一次有力地证明了社会主义力量超过了帝国主义力量，东风压倒了西风。
    巴黎会议的结果表明，全世界人民对美帝国主义的战争阴谋绝不能放松警惕，必须坚持不懈地为维护世界和平而努力。只要各国人民把和平事业坚持到底，美帝国主义的侵略计划是一定能够被粉碎的。在巴黎会议上，帝国主义阵营内部矛盾的尖锐化和美国所遭到的巨大困难，也说明了这种可能性。目前的国际形势对争取和平的斗争空前有利。各国爱好和平的人民必须继续斗争，彻底粉碎帝国主义的任何反和平的阴谋，为争取世界持久和平而努力。
