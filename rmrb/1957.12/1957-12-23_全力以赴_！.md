Notes

    "Go All Out"!
    The British Information Office issued a commentary on the 20th, saying that if the Soviet Union does not accept the so-called "Foreign Ministers' Conference" that Western countries are trying to use to obstruct disarmament negotiations, then Western countries will "go all out."
    This is probably Britain's so-called "deterrence" policy. In order to implement this "bluff" policy without capital, Britain has set a very good example, letting American planes carrying hydrogen bombs circle over its territory all day long, agreeing to the United States establishing medium-range missile bases on its territory, and British Prime Minister Macmillan even shamelessly admitting that Britain has lived under the protection of the United States for nine years. How else is Britain prepared to "go all out"?
    Such "going all out" will not scare anyone. It is better to honestly accept the Soviet Union's proposal and convene a special session of the United Nations or a disarmament conference to jointly resolve the issue of disarmament.

### “全力以赴”！

    “全力以赴”！
    英国新闻处20日发表一篇评论说，如果苏联不接受西方国家企图用以阻挠裁军谈判的所谓“外长会议”，那么，西方国家就要“全力以赴”了。
    这大概就是英国的所谓“威慑”政策罢。为了执行这种没有本钱的“实力讹诈”政策，英国已经做出很好的榜样，让美国飞机带着氢弹整天在它的国土上空盘旋，答应美国在它领土上建立中程导弹基地，英国首相麦克米伦甚至毫不羞耻地承认英国是在美国的保护下生活了九年。英国还准备怎样“全力以赴”呢？
    这样的“全力以赴”是吓不了人的，还是老老实实地接受苏联的建议，召开联合国特别会议或裁军代表会议来共同解决裁军问题吧。
