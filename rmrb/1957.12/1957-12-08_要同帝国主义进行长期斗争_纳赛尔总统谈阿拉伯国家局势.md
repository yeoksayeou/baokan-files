　　To Wage a Protracted Struggle Against Imperialism
　　President Nasser Discusses the Situation in Arab Countries
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 6th: Egyptian President Nasser said on the 5th that the main goal of the imperialists towards Arab countries is to overthrow the nationalist governments of these countries and replace them with pro-imperialist governments in order to gain indirect control over the Middle East.

    He pointed out that in order to achieve the above objectives, they implement arms embargoes, corrupting means, colluding to offer bribes, assassinations, and use Israel.

    Nasser made these remarks when delivering the opening speech at the Third National Cooperative Society Conference of Egypt.

    Nasser said that Egypt has won, but the battle is still ongoing because imperialism will not be reconciled, it is still attempting to include the Middle East within its sphere of influence, and will use all means to achieve this goal. He said: "We must be vigilant at all times. This struggle may continue for ten years or more."

    Nasser said that Egypt, after a period of transition and the establishment of parliamentary life, has entered a new stage, the purpose of which is to establish a "socialist, democratic, cooperative society."

    He said that Egypt hopes to have a planned economy. "We want to encourage the cooperative movement and establish cooperation to replace individualism."

    The conference is scheduled to last for two days. The conference will discuss the plan for the cooperative movement in Egypt in the next five years. There are currently about three thousand various cooperatives in Egypt, with a total of about one million members. The national cooperative organization—the National Cooperative Federation—was established in 1955, and the first national cooperative conference was held in the same year.

　　要同帝国主义进行长期斗争
　  纳赛尔总统谈阿拉伯国家局势
    据新华社开罗6日电　埃及总统纳赛尔5日说，帝国主义者对阿拉伯国家的主要目的是推翻这些国家的民族主义政府，代之以亲帝国主义的政府，以取得对中东的间接控制。
    他指出，为了达到上述目的，他们实行军火禁运、腐化手段、合谋行贿、暗杀，并且利用以色列。
    纳赛尔是在埃及第三届全国合作社会议上致开幕词时说这番话的。
    纳赛尔说，埃及是胜利了，但是战斗仍然在进行，因为帝国主义不会甘心，它仍然企图把中东包括在它们的势力范围之内，并且会使用一切手段来达到这个目的。他说：“我们必须时刻提防戒备。这场斗争可能要继续十年或更多一些时间。”
    纳赛尔说，埃及在经过过渡时期和建立议会生活以后跨入了一个新阶段，这个阶段的目的是建立“社会主义、民主、合作的社会”。
    他说，埃及希望有计划经济。“我们要鼓励合作运动并且建立合作来代替个人主义。”
    这次会议预订举行两天。会议将讨论将来五年中埃及合作社运动的计划。埃及全国目前约有各种合作社三千个，社员总数约一百万人。全国性的合作社机构——全国合作社联合会——是在1955年成立的，同年召开了全国合作社第一次会议。
