Learning Skills on Baozhu Mountain

　　A group of young cadres from the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, sent to the mountainous areas to participate in labor and production, have begun their pleasant working lives at the Laizhou Forest Farm in northern Fujian. They are assigned to two production teams: one part works at the forest farm headquarters in weeding and cultivating forests; the other part reclaims wasteland and afforests on Baozhu Mountain, which is twenty miles away from the forest farm and over 1,000 meters above sea level. They live and work with the workers. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Xiang Zhi)

　　Zhou Tingnan (right), Deputy Editor-in-Chief of Fujian Youth Daily, Xu Hualun (center), Section Chief of the Youth Workers Department of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Chen Biyu (left), a cadre from Fujian Youth Daily, began their first lesson in labor—assembling the newly received mountain rake to go to the mountain to weed.

　　Wild fruits on the mountain are good snacks during labor breaks.

　　Washing away the day's sweat in the clear mountain stream, fatigue slowly disappears.

　　他们在海拔一千多公尺高的宝珠山上垦荒造林。
　　福建青年报副总编辑周挺南（右）、共青团福建省委青工部科长许华伦（中）和福建青年报干部陈碧玉（左）开始了劳动的第一课——安装起新领来的山耙，到山上去除草。
　　山岭上的野果是劳动休息时的好点心。
　　在盈盈的山溪里，洗濯掉一天的汗污，疲劳也慢慢消失了。
