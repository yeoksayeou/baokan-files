    "Sidewinder" and Japan
    Commentator of this newspaper
    The Japanese government's decision to accept "Sidewinder" missiles supplied by the United States has aroused fierce opposition in the Japanese Diet and domestic public opinion. However, Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, in response to questions in the Senate on the 23rd, still declared that he has "no intention of refusing" to accept U.S. missiles. This means that the Japanese rulers are determined to link Japan's fate to the United States' so-called missile strategy, regardless of the opposition of the vast majority of the Japanese people. This action by the Japanese government is not only extremely dangerous for the Japanese people, but will also make the situation in Asia more tense.
    The recently concluded Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization showed that establishing missile bases around the world is one of the key points of the U.S. aggressive policy. The United States is forcing Japan to step up its rearmament and transporting "Sidewinder" missiles into Japan, which is precisely the implementation of its policy in the East. The purpose is to turn Japan into a U.S. missile invasion base.
    The Japanese government has tried its best to argue that its acceptance of the U.S. "Sidewinder" missiles is aimed at strengthening "defense." This is obviously just a way to deceive the Japanese people. In fact, the U.S. military bases in Japan are the real threat to Japan's security; other than that, no one is threatening Japan. Since the Japanese government can accept U.S. "Sidewinder" missiles, it can also accept other U.S. missiles; and once the Japanese government accepts missiles, it will be impossible not to establish missile bases in Japan. Therefore, Japan's acceptance of U.S. "Sidewinder" missiles is actually the first step towards becoming a U.S. missile base and also opens the door for the United States to transport nuclear weapons in the future. This puts Japan in an extremely dangerous situation because if the United States really launches a missile war, then Japan, as a missile launch base, will inevitably suffer devastating retaliation. Japan is small in size, with a highly concentrated population and industry. The damage suffered during a missile war will inevitably be more severe than in other countries. Therefore, peace-loving people in Japan have long pointed out that if Japan wants to play an active role in international affairs, it should strengthen its efforts for peace, not follow the U.S. war policy. Faced with the voices of the vast majority of Japanese people opposing the acceptance of U.S. missiles, the decision-makers of the Japanese government should give it a calm and profound thought.

    “响尾蛇”和日本
    本报评论员
    日本政府决定接受美国供给的“响尾蛇”式导弹，已引起了日本国会和国内舆论的激烈反对。但日本首相岸信介23日在参议院答复质询时，仍然宣称“无意拒绝”接受美国的导弹。这就是说，日本执政者决心不顾日本广大人民的反对而把日本的命运同美国的所谓导弹战略连在一起了。日本政府的这一行动，不仅对日本人民来说是极端危险的，而且也会使亚洲的局势更形紧张。
    不久以前结束的北大西洋集团巴黎会议说明，在世界各地建立导弹基地是美国的侵略政策的要点之一。美国迫使日本加紧重新武装，并把“响尾蛇”式导弹运进日本，正是它的这个政策在东方的实施，其目的就是要把日本变为美国的导弹侵略基地。
    日本政府竭力辩解说，它接受美国的“响尾蛇”式导弹，目的是为了加强“防御”。这显然不过是一种蒙蔽日本人民耳目的说法而已。事实上美国在日本的军事基地，是日本安全的真正威胁，除此以外，没有任何人威胁日本。日本政府既然能够接受美国的“响尾蛇”式导弹，也就能够接受美国的其它导弹；而日本政府接受了导弹，就不可能不在日本建立导弹基地，因此，日本接受美国的“响尾蛇”式导弹，实际上已使日本向着成为美国导弹基地的方向迈了第一步，也为今后美国运进核武器打开了方便之门。这就把日本置于极危险的境地。因为如果美国真的发动一场导弹战争，那末，作为导弹发射基地的日本，不可能不会遭到毁灭性的回击。日本幅员很小，人口和工业很集中，在导弹战争中遭受回击时破坏必然较别的国家更加严重。因此，日本的爱好和平人士早已指出，日本如果想在国际事务中起积极的作用，它应该作的是加强和平的努力，而不是追随美国的战争政策。面对着日本广大人民反对接受美国导弹的呼声，日本政府决策人是应该冷静深思一番的。
