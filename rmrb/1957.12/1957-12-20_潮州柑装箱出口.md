    Chaozhou Mandarin Oranges Packed for Export
    The first batch of the famous Chaozhou mandarin oranges for export was shipped to the Soviet Union at the beginning of this month. It is estimated that this year's output will reach 1.14 million dan (1 dan = 50 kg), an increase of 60,000 dan compared to last year. Both the output and quality are higher than in any year in history. The A and B grade oranges available for export will exceed 85% of the total. At present, the woodenware production cooperatives in Shantou City are working hard to rush production of wooden boxes for packing the oranges. The Shantou Cannery has begun its annual production of canned fresh oranges. ·Ke Bingfan·

    著名的潮州柑第一批出口生柑也于本月初运往苏联。估计今年产量可达到一百一十四万担，比去年增产六万担。产量质量都比历史上任何一年高。可供出口的甲、乙级柑将超过总数的85％。目前汕头市各木器生产社正紧张地在赶制装柑木箱。汕头罐头厂已开始一年一度的生柑罐头生产。　·柯炳藩·
