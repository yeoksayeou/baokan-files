    When someone pointed out that the majority, essentially, of today's intellectuals are still bourgeois, some intellectuals, as if Chen Tuan had slept for a thousand years, suddenly woke up from a deep dream and asked: "Intellectuals belonged to the petty bourgeoisie in the semi-colonial and semi-feudal old society. Why have they 'upgraded' in socialist society?" If it were really due to a lack of understanding of the ups and downs of intellectuals in social change, it wouldn't be anything; but I think the posing of the question is not that simple. In fact, I am afraid it is still to cover up their true class attributes, deliberately half-truth and half-false, and find excuses in a questioning tone.

    Anyone with a little common sense of social science will know that intellectuals themselves do not constitute a class. But if combined with their economic status, political stance, and ideological consciousness, it is not so simple. In the past, without tens of acres of land, a few strings of money, or a government position for one's father, there would be no conditions to acquire knowledge. The so-called "intellectuals" of today are the same as the so-called "scholars and literati" of ancient times. To put it bluntly, the vast majority of them used money exploited from the working people to obtain knowledge. At the same time, they must rely on this knowledge to serve the exploiters in exchange for the so-called "positions" for individuals. In this way, saying that they are attached to the exploiting classes is "deserved"; to say modestly that they belong to the petty bourgeoisie, there is naturally even less reason not to nod, agree, raise their hands in approval, and remain calm.

    That said, it's still a bit far off. Let's just talk about the old society of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal era. Under the multiple oppressions of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital, many people, even with the capital of "knowledge," could not get appreciation. They still wanted to climb up to serve the ruling class, but as fate dictated, only a few who served the bureaucratic bourgeoisie could "raise their eyebrows and exhale" and rise like clouds; while the majority belonging to the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie sank, sank, the sky fell and the earth cracked, to what end, facing the crisis of bankruptcy, and the difficulties of unemployment and lack of education. Thus, for the sake of themselves and the interests of their class, they finally rose up and participated in the democratic revolution under the leadership of the Communist Party. Some of them accepted the transformation of the working class, joined the ranks of the working class, and became the working class; but the majority still fantasized that after the success of the revolution, they could realize their goals according to their old ways. Their world outlook and philosophy of life, their ideology and way of life, were still bourgeois. In order to distinguish them from intellectuals who served the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, such as Hu Shi, calling them petty bourgeois did not mean changing their original class nature. Isn't this also very natural?

    However, now that it has reached the socialist period, they are still pushing the cart along the old road. They have not thought that the world has been turned upside down, the socialist transformation has been fully launched, and the old road they want to take is a dead end. Their cart has also been pushed to the edge of the cliff. Pull them back, and they are stuck there, unable to turn back for a while, and say that this is the "freedom" of their "petty bourgeoisie." In the fierce struggle between the two roads, shout out loud and restore their original appearance: you were originally bourgeois intellectuals! Let's see where you are going! This is of great benefit to the transformation of these intellectuals. There is no "upgrade," and there is no need to be ambiguous.

    The words have already been spoken clearly, and it is better to be realistic. Anyway, the petty bourgeoisie also belongs to the category of the bourgeoisie, and I think there is no need to be coy and nitpick about the issue of class attributes. It's better to arrange to transform yourself and take the socialist road!

    谈知识分子的“升级”
    东郭迪吉
    当有人指明今天知识分子的大多数、实质上还是资产阶级的以后，有些知识分子，好像陈抟一睡千年、忽然从沉沉大梦中蓦地醒来似的，提出疑问说：“知识分子在半殖民半封建的旧社会中倒属于小资产阶级，为什么在社会主义社会‘升级’了呢？如果真的由于不了解社会变革中知识分子浮沉情况，倒也呒啥；但我看问题的提出，却未必如此简单，事实上怕还是在掩饰自己的真实的阶级属性，故意的半真半假以怀疑口吻找借口罢了。
    略懂一点社会科学常识的人，都会知道单讲知识分子本身，他是不成其为阶级的；可是如果结合着他的经济地位、政治立场、思想意识去看，就不那样简单。在过去家无几十亩田产、几贯金钱，或者爸爸老子没有一官半职，就不可能有博取知识的条件；今之所谓“知识分子”也者，亦即古之所谓“秀才学士”者流，说句不大客气的话，他们的绝大多数都是拿着从劳动人民那里剥削得来的钱去求得知识的。同时，他们又要仗借这知识，为剥削者服务，以换取一个个人的所谓“职位”。这样，说他们是依附于剥削阶级的，本也当之无“愧”；谦虚点说他们是属于小资产阶级，自然更没有理由不点头首肯、举手赞成而泰然自若的了。
    这样说，扯的还远了一些。单说半殖民地半封建的旧社会时代吧。在帝国主义、封建势力，再加上官僚资本，几重压迫之下，许多人虽有着“知识”的本钱，却得不到赏识。他们仍然还想爬上去为统治阶级服务，但命里注定，也只有少数为官僚资产阶级服务的人能够“扬眉吐气”，腾云而起；而属于资产阶级和小资产阶级的大多数人则沉呵，沉呵，天塌地陷，伊于胡底，遭到破产的危机，遭到失业失学的困难。于是，他们为本身和本阶级利益计，终于也在共产党领导之下，奋起参加民主革命了。其中有一部分人，接受了工人阶级的改造，参加了工人阶级的队伍，成了工人阶级；而多数，却还幻想着革命成功之后，能按自己的老路实现自己的目的，这些人的宇宙观和人生观，他们的意识形态和生活方式还是资产阶级的。为了使他们同为官僚资产阶级服务的知识分子，如胡适之流，有所区别，称他们为小资产阶级的，这并不等于改变了他们原有的阶级性质。这不也是很自然的吗？
    可是，已到了社会主义时期，他们还是沿着老道道推车子，就没有想到已经天翻地覆，社会主义改造已全面展开，而他们要走的那条老路，已是一条到头了的死路，他们的车子也已推到了悬崖的边上。拉他们回头，他们又卡在那里，一时回不过头来，还说这是他们的“小资产阶级”的“自由”。在两条道路的激烈斗争中，大喊一声，还他们一个本来面目：你们原都是资产阶级的知识分子！看你们到底往哪里走？这对这些知识分子的改造是大有好处的。并非什么“升级”，也没有什么含糊的必要。
    话已经说的一明二白，还是实事求是的好。横竖小资产阶级也属于资产阶级范畴，我看就用不到对阶级属性问题忸忸怩怩而斤斤计较了。还是安排着改造自己走社会主义路吧！
