Industrial production plans must fully consider various positive factors and huge production potential to make the production plan have an advanced mobilizing effect, paying attention to the proactiveness of the plan; at the same time, the production plan must be placed on a realistic and feasible basis, paying attention to the reliability of the plan. This is the basic principle for determining the plan. For several years, our country's economic plans have been basically formulated in accordance with this principle. However, it is undeniable that in the past few years, especially after 1956, among some economic workers in some departments, there has been a conservative tendency to one-sidedly emphasize the reliability of the plan while ignoring and denying the proactiveness and advanced nature of the plan. They focused mainly on how to prevent rash advances and compress excessively high production targets, while paying little attention to how to mobilize production potential to overcome difficulties and actively increase production.

    Various Conservative Thoughts

These economic workers often use various reasons to justify this conservative tendency.

For example, some people believe that in determining the production plan for consumer goods, the main thing should be to prevent rash advances. The reason is that most consumer goods rely on agricultural products as raw materials, and the supply of raw materials is extremely unstable. If the production plan is set lower, the production plan can be increased at any time if there are more raw materials. This facilitates production arrangements, and everyone below welcomes it. If the plan is set very high, and it is found that there are not enough raw materials during the implementation process, and the production plan is forced to be reduced, it will cause difficulties in production arrangements, encounter resistance from below, and put the higher-level authorities in a passive position. Of course, this statement has some basis. The time for compiling the control figures for the annual plan has always been earlier, and the agricultural harvest is often not completely certain. Therefore, when determining the production control figures for consumer goods, it should be more cautious and it is necessary to set them lower. However, it should be recognized that this is only a "temporary" measure when compiling production plan control figures before the agricultural harvest is determined. When formally compiling the national plan, the agricultural harvest can basically be confirmed. At this time, the determination of production targets should, of course, fully consider various positive factors to make it an active and advanced plan. Therefore, the principle for determining the production plan for consumer goods is the same as that for the entire industrial production plan, which must be both proactive and reliable. The view that the production plan for consumer goods should pay more attention to reliability and mainly prevent rash advances is obviously incorrect.

There is also a view that the plan should be set lower, intentionally leaving room for enterprises so that they can be sure to overfulfill it. In this way, enterprises will be more motivated to overfulfill the plan. Conversely, if the targets are set too high, employees will feel unable to exceed them, and their production enthusiasm will be reduced. According to this view, deliberately lowering targets that can obviously be achieved so that enterprises can exceed them effortlessly, this kind of plan is of course a conservative and passive plan, which cannot promote enterprises to deeply explore potential capabilities. Enterprises will lie on this backward plan and become increasingly lax, weakening their efforts to improve economic management. According to materials reflected by the Industrial Department of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, many leading cadres of factories and mines have stated that it is beneficial for the state to demand more strictly from enterprises and set more proactive plans to promote the progress of enterprises.

Some comrades are also concerned that if the production plan for certain raw material industries is set high and the output is included in the allocation of resources; but if the production plan is not completed as a result of implementation, it will affect the balance of material supply. Therefore, they would rather set the production plan lower to avoid loopholes in the plan implementation process. This understanding is not in line with the actual situation. The result of the implementation of production plans by various departments will have two possibilities, either completion and exceeding, or failure to complete. Therefore, the material distribution plan must always maintain a certain reserve and maneuverable quantity for adjustment. In fact, there are end-of-period inventory, current year preparation, and national reserve items in the material supply plan. Materials listed in these items can be temporarily adjusted. Therefore, the problem that these comrades are worried about does not exist under normal circumstances. If we are afraid that the failure to complete the production plan will affect the material supply plan, and therefore consciously compress the production plan, it will inevitably make the production plan conservative and backward, create an artificial tension in the supply of certain materials, affect the economic activities of other departments, and make things that could have been done impossible. This runs counter to the central government's requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical.

Some comrades also spread a kind of inexplicable argument: "Why bother arguing endlessly with the production department for a few thousand tons of copper, hundreds of thousands of tons of coal...? Anyway, setting it high does not mean that the enterprise will produce more; even if it is set lower, the enterprise is led by Communist Party members and will not deliberately reduce production." They advocate casually setting a number. This is a decadent liberalist view and an attitude of nihilism towards the national plan. According to this, why is there a need for a national plan? Let everything develop freely with the objective process of things!

From the above, it can be seen that eliminating all kinds of conservative views and unifying planning thinking is one of the important conditions for improving the quality of economic plans, thereby promoting the smooth development of economic undertakings.

    Huge Potential

Our emphasis on the proactiveness of the plan and opposition to the conservative tendency in planning work is by no means based solely on general theory, but starts from the real economic life of our country. That is: there is still huge potential hidden in our country's industrial production. Continuously exploring these potentials can promote rapid development of production.

According to the current situation in our country, production potential is mainly manifested in the following aspects:

First, fully explore and utilize new raw material resources. The production of consumer goods in our country has grown very slowly due to insufficient raw materials. It is necessary to find and utilize new raw material resources to supplement the shortage of agricultural raw materials. Through the efforts of all parties in recent years, a wide variety of raw material resources have been discovered. In the textile industry, more than ten kinds of animal and plant fibers have now been discovered, which can be studied as raw materials for textiles. For example, tussah silk is a very important textile raw material. According to preliminary surveys, the national tussah forest area suitable for raising tussah silkworms is 28 million mu, while the current actual breeding area is only 14 million mu. In 1956, the actual output of tussah silkworm cocoons was still far below the highest annual output in history. Cotton linters are also an important resource. According to preliminary surveys, the weight of cottonseed is 63% of the weight of seed cotton, and each 100 jin of cottonseed can produce an average of 7.5 jin of short lint. According to the national output of 30 million dan of cotton, there are about 3.8 million dan of cotton linters. Cotton linters can be spun into coarse yarn, made into cotton-padded clothes, or used as raw materials for man-made fibers and important chemical raw materials. This year, various places have begun to install a large number of delinting equipment for production. In terms of linen textiles, a large number of untapped raw material resources have also been discovered. For example, cotton stalk bark has been proven by experiments to be blended with jute. It is estimated that there are about 9 million dan of cotton stalk bark nationwide. In recent years, due to the shortage of jute supply, the output of gunny sacks has been far from meeting the needs. However, it is a pity that the textile department has not yet made good use of cotton stalk bark. In addition, there are many fiber raw materials that have not been fully utilized, which will not be listed one by one. We believe that with the joint efforts of scientific organs and economic departments, the field of fiber raw materials will continue to expand.

In the leather industry, the rational utilization of pigskin is an important issue. At present, leather products, whether for export or domestic sales, cannot meet the needs; however, most of the large amount of pigskin in China has not been utilized. This year, about 70 million pigs will be slaughtered nationwide. If all the skins are peeled and made into leather products, the output value can reach about 2.5 billion to 2.8 billion yuan. However, only about 2% of the pigs are skinned, and the rest of the pigskin is sold to consumers along with the meat. Because pigskin has low edible value, most of it is actually wasted. From a price point of view, pigskin sells to consumers as meat for only about 8 yuan per piece, while the price of leather products made from it can reach 35 to 40 yuan. It is estimated that the national pigskinning rate will be 2%-3% this year, but in some regions, such as Shandong Province, the skinning rate has reached more than 50%. It can be seen how great the potential of pigskin is. Therefore, actively taking measures to peel more pigskin has become a key to completely solving the shortage of leather raw materials.

In the food industry, the full utilization of wild plants is also of great significance. According to the materials provided by the National Mountain Commercial Work Conference held by the Fifth Office of the State Council, it is estimated that the national output of wild acorns is about 2.7 billion jin. Acorns can be used to make wine. As long as one-third of them are used, they can completely replace the grain currently used for winemaking. In addition, there are many unused plant resources.

From the above, it can be seen that actively exploring and utilizing potential resources can accelerate the growth of consumer goods production.

Second, give full play to equipment capacity and improve equipment utilization. Some people believe that during the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the potential of equipment has basically been realized, and the potential in the Second Five-Year Plan is very small. Of course, the equipment capacity of any enterprise has an objective maximum limit. The more fully the equipment capacity has been utilized in the past, the smaller the potential that can continue to be explored. However, due to the continuous improvement of production technology and operating methods, and due to the continuous adoption of technical measures based on new technologies and the continuous improvement of original equipment, equipment capacity can still be continuously improved. In this sense, it is never possible to reach the point of "exhausting the potential and finding all the tricks." For example, the utilization rate of iron smelting equipment capacity was about one ton of iron per cubic meter of blast furnace volume per day and night in 1952, and it is expected to reach about 1.3 tons this year; the amount of steel produced per square meter of furnace hearth area per day and night in steelmaking furnaces (open hearth furnaces) was only 4.78 tons in 1952, and increased to 6.67 tons in 1957. However, we must not think that the capacity of steel equipment cannot be improved any further. According to the estimation of technical personnel, in terms of iron smelting, if the blast temperature is increased, high-pressure furnace tops and other advanced experiences are adopted, the production capacity can be increased by more than 10%. In terms of steelmaking, if oxygen steelmaking methods are adopted or new refractory materials are used for the furnace top, the production capacity can be increased by at least 20%. Production practice in recent years has proved that as long as workers and technicians are mobilized, new experiences can be continuously created, thereby continuously improving equipment capacity. Therefore, the plan must fully estimate the great significance of advanced experience and advanced technology, and fully estimate the subjective initiative of people, otherwise it will fall into the quagmire of conservatism.

We should also see the huge potential of newly built enterprises. Every year, many newly built enterprises in our country are put into production. It takes a considerable amount of time for the production of these enterprises to reach the designed level. Taking measures to shorten the time to reach the designed capacity can improve production capacity. At the same time, the design capacity of these enterprises generally leaves a safety factor, and experience proves that the production level can exceed the design level to a great extent. Taking the coal industry as an example. According to the conventional practice in the plan, it takes about four years for a mechanized new vertical shaft with 1.5 million tons to reach its designed capacity. The production capacity in the first year of production does not reach 15% of the designed capacity. However, according to the staff of several coal mines, it actually takes only two or three years to reach the designed capacity. The production capacity of the coal mines designed by the Soviet Union for our country is calculated based on 300 days of production per year, while our actual production time is 351 days, which shows that exceeding the design capacity is very certain.

Third, save raw materials. Due to the large-scale economic construction being carried out in our country, the shortage of material supply is inevitable. Therefore, saving materials has great economic significance. The production of many industrial sectors is limited by the shortage of raw materials. Therefore, saving raw materials is equivalent to increasing production. First of all, the forestry industry should be pointed out. Due to various reasons, the waste of wood in the forestry industry is very serious. According to a preliminary survey by the Yichun Forestry Industry Administration, the production task this year is 2.8 million cubic meters, but the discarded wood (including small-diameter wood, branches, stumps, etc.) reaches 1.33 million cubic meters. A large part of this wood can be used as industrial raw materials. This phenomenon exists in all forest areas in the country. In terms of wood processing, the general output rate is only about 70%, and there are about 20% of slats and bark. They are good raw materials for papermaking, but most of them are burned. Therefore, it is of great significance to increase the output rate and utilization rate of transported wood and reduce the waste of wood.

The potential for the machinery industry to save metal raw materials is very large. For example, Beijing Machine Tool Plant No. 1 uses 3,880 kilograms of materials for each universal milling machine produced, while Qiqihar Machine Tool Plant uses 4,396 kilograms of materials for each similar product produced. As long as the process is improved and the cutting rate is reduced, a large amount of raw materials can be saved. There are many mechanical equipment with the same performance but with very different weights, some even differing by several times. Therefore, with the continuous improvement of product design, the possibility of saving metal is very great.

Fourth, in the mining industry, increasing the attendance rate of workers, thereby increasing labor productivity, is also an important way to increase production. In recent years, the attendance rate of coal mine production workers has declined year by year. The attendance rate reached 92.32% in 1955, 89.79% in 1956, and only 87.4% in the highest month (May) in 1957. Due to the low attendance rate, underground production is abnormal, which greatly reduces coal mining volume. If the attendance rate of production workers this year reaches the level of 1955, 2.18 million working days can be increased, and under normal conditions, the output of raw coal can be increased by more than 2.5 million tons. We are a socialist country and have all the conditions to achieve the highest attendance rate. The key to the problem is to actively take measures to improve the socialist enthusiasm of workers through a nationwide rectification movement. Changing certain wage and bonus systems that are not fully in line with the principle of distribution according to work based on the actual situation will also promote the improvement of labor productivity.

Fifth, correctly arranging the balance between production and needs, and properly handling the relationship between production and reserves, can also promote the发挥of production potential and the normal growth of production. In the past few years, our national plan has been basically balanced in the arrangement of production and needs. However, when considering the balance between production and needs, we often only see the current year and lack a longer-term perspective of looking forward and backward. For example, in the second half of 1955, almost all important materials: coal, wood, pig iron, steel, cement, etc., exceeded the needs. At that time, some economic workers believed that it would be better to stop or reduce production than to produce and "stockpile" in warehouses, occupying working capital, and did not consider future needs, nor did they consider reserves. Therefore, the output of several major products was compressed in 1955. Looking at it today, this is a lesson. If we could have produced more important materials and stored them in 1955, not only would the production in 1955 not have contracted so much, but also the tense situation of material supply caused by the production upsurge in 1956 could have been greatly alleviated, and the production in 1957 could have been carried out better. Currently, there are still some planning workers who only care about the needs of the current year, and as long as production exceeds the needs of the current year (even if it is materials that the country needs very much in the future), they advocate compressing production targets. I believe that important materials such as pig iron, steel, and coal should always give full play to production capacity and actively produce. Of course, on the other hand, excessively and inappropriately emphasizing reserves is also uneconomical.

Based on the above analysis, it can be said that the potential strength of industrial production is very great. Not only is there potential now, but there will be potential for a long time to come. Our economic plan must fully consider these positive factors, must have an advanced mobilizing effect, and promote and organize people to fight for exploring potential and increasing production. The task of the planning agency is to continuously discover new potentials and promote the progress and development of production, and never put the main focus on "controlling production," "preventing rash advances," and compressing "excessively high" production targets, of course, this is by no means to say that it is necessary to deviate from realistic economic conditions and fall into the quagmire of utopianism.

    工业生产计划的积极性和可靠性
　　门晋如
    在确定工业生产计划时，必须充分考虑到各种积极因素和生产上的巨大潜力，使生产计划具有先进的动员作用，注意到计划的积极性；同时，也必须把生产计划放在现实的切实可行的基础上，注意到计划的可靠性。这是确定计划的基本原则。几年来，我们国家的经济计划基本上是按照这样的原则制定的。但是，不容否认，在过去几年，尤其是1956年以后，在若干部门的部分经济工作人员中，存在着和滋长着一种片面地强调计划的可靠性，而忽视和否定计划的积极性和先进性的保守倾向。他们把主要注意力放在如何防止冒进和压缩过高的生产指标上，而对于如何动员生产上的潜力来克服困难、积极增产，却注意得很少。
    保守思想种种
    这些经济工作人员，常常用各种理由来为这种保守倾向辩护。
    例如，有人认为在确定消费品的生产计划时，主要的应该是防止冒进倾向。理由是：消费品大部分是依靠农产品做原料，而原料供应情况极不稳定。如果把生产计划定得低一点，原料多了，可以随时提高生产计划。这样，便利于生产的安排，下面都很欢迎。如果计划定得很高，执行过程中发现原料不够再被迫减低生产计划，就使生产安排上发生困难，遭到下面的抵抗，使上级机关陷于被动。当然，这种说法是有一定根据的。历年来编制年度计划控制数字的时间较早，农业收成往往尚未完全肯定，因而在确定消费品的生产控制数字时，应该更慎重一些，宁肯定得低一点，这是必要的。但是应该认识到：这只是在农业收成未确定前，编制生产计划控制数字时的一种“权宜”办法。当正式编制国家计划时，农业收成已经可以基本上肯定，这时，确定生产指标当然要充分考虑到各种积极因素，使之成为积极的和先进的计划。因此，确定消费品生产计划的原则和整个工业生产计划是一样的，既要积极又要可靠。认为消费品生产计划应该更多的注意可靠性，主要应该防止冒进的观点，显然是不正确的。
    还有这样一种观点：认为计划应该定得低些，有意识地为企业留余地，使企业能有把握地超额完成。这样，企业为了超额完成计划，生产积极性就更高了。相反的，如果指标定得太高，企业职工感到无法超过，生产积极性就会降低。依据这种观点，把明明可以达到的指标故意降低，以便企业可以毫不费力地超过，这种计划当然是保守的消极的计划，不可能推动企业去深入地发掘潜在能力。企业会躺在这种落后的计划上面而日益松懈下去，削弱了对改善经济管理工作的努力。据辽宁省委工业部反映的材料，许多厂、矿的领导干部都表示国家对企业要求得严格一些，计划定得积极一些，对推动企业的进步是有利的。
    还有的同志耽心，如果把某些原材料工业的生产计划定高了，把产量列入了分配资源中；但执行结果完不成生产计划，就会影响物资供应的平衡。因此他们宁肯把生产计划定得低些，以避免在计划执行过程中发生漏洞。这种认识是不符合实际情况的。各部门生产计划执行的结果都会有两种可能，或者完成和超过，或者完不成。因此物资分配计划必须经常保持一定的储备和机动数量来进行调剂。事实上物资供应计划中都有期末库存、当年准备、国家储备等项目。列在这些项目中的物资都可以进行临时调剂。因此这些同志所耽心的问题，在一般情况下是不存在的。如果我们害怕生产计划完不成影响物资供应计划，因而有意识地压缩生产计划，一定会使生产计划保守落后，会造成某些物资供应的人为紧张，影响到其他部门的经济活动，使本来可办的事也不能办了。这与中央提出的多快好省的要求是背道而驰的。
    还有的同志散布这样一种莫名其妙的论调：“何必因为几千吨铜，几十万吨煤……而和生产部门争论不休呢？反正定高了不等于企业生产多了；即使定低点，企业是共产党员领导的，也不会故意减少生产。”他们主张随便订个数字就行了。这是一种腐朽的自由主义观点，是对于国家计划的取消主义态度。照这样说，何必要国家计划呢？让一切都随着事物的客观进程去自流发展就算了！
    由上述种种可以看到，清除各色各样的保守观点，统一计划思想，是提高经济计划的质量，从而促进经济事业顺利发展的重要条件之一。
    巨大的潜力
    我们强调计划的积极性，反对计划工作上的保守倾向，决不仅仅是从一般理论上提出的，而是从我国的现实经济生活出发的。这就是：在我国的工业生产方面还蕴藏着巨大的潜力，不断地发掘这些潜力，就可以促进生产迅速的发展。
    就我国目前情况说，生产潜力主要表现在下列几方面：
    第一是充分发掘和利用新的原料资源。我国消费资料的生产，由于原料不足，增长很慢，必须找寻与利用新的原料资源来补充农业原料的不足。几年来由于各方面的努力，已经发现了多种多样的原料资源。在纺织工业方面，目前已经发现有十种以上的动植物纤维，可以研究作为纺织的原料。例如柞蚕丝就是一种很重要的纺织原料。根据初步调查，全国适于放养柞蚕的柞林面积有二千八百万亩，而目前实际放养面积只有一千四百万亩。1956年柞蚕茧的实际产量，还远低于历史上最高年产量。棉子绒也是一项重要资源。根据初步调查，棉子重量为籽棉重量的63％，而每一百斤棉子平均可剥短绒七点五斤，照全国三千万担棉花产量计算，棉子绒大约有三百八十万担。棉子绒可以纺粗纱，可以做绒衣，也可做人造纤维的原料，和重要的化工原料。今年各地已开始大量安装剥绒设备进行生产。在麻纺织方面，也发现许多尚未利用的大量原料资源。例如棉秆皮，经过试验已证明可以与黄麻混纺。估计全国棉秆皮有九百万担左右。近几年来，由于黄麻供应不足，麻袋产量远不能满足需要。但遗憾的是，纺织部门对棉秆皮至今仍未很好地加以利用。此外，科学院在西北各省发现大量的野生麻，纤维很好，可以纺很高级的织品，估计全国产量在一百五十万担左右，尚待加以利用。没有充分利用的纤维原料还有很多，不一一列举了。我们相信在科学机关和经济部门的共同努力之下，纤维原料的领域必将日益扩大。
    在皮革工业方面，合理利用猪皮是个重要问题。目前皮革制品，不论出口的或内销的都不能满足需要；但国内大量的猪皮，绝大部分还没有被利用。今年全国宰猪七千万头左右，如果全部剥皮并做成皮革制品，产值可达到二十五亿至二十八亿元左右，但是目前只有2％左右的猪是剥皮的，其余的猪皮都连肉一起卖给消费者了。由于猪皮食用价值较低，实际上大部分是被浪费了。从价格上看，猪皮当肉卖给消费者，每张皮不过八元左右，制成皮革制品的价格就可达三十五到四十元。今年预计全国猪的剥皮率为2％—3％，但是有的地区，如山东省的剥皮率已达50％以上。由此可见，猪皮的潜力多么大了。因此，积极采取措施多剥猪皮，已成为彻底解决皮革原料不足的一个关键。
    在食品工业方面，充分利用野生植物也有重要意义。根据国务院五办召开的全国山区商业工作会议提供的材料，估计全国野生橡子产量约有二十七亿斤。橡子可以酿酒，只要利用三分之一，就可以全部代替目前用于酿酒的粮食。此外还有很多未被利用的植物资源。
    从以上所述就可以看出，积极发掘和利用潜在的资源，就可以加速消费资料生产的增长。
    第二是充分发挥设备能力，提高设备利用率。有些人认为第一个五年计划时期中，设备潜力已经基本上发挥出来了，第二个五年计划中潜力就很小了。当然，任何企业的设备能力都有一个客观的最高限度，已往设备能力发挥得愈充分，可以继续发掘的潜力也就愈小。但是，由于生产技术操作方法的不断改进，由于根据新技术不断采取技术措施，不断改进原有设备，所以，设备能力还是可以不断提高的。在这个意义上来说，是永远不可能走到
  “潜力挖尽，窍门找光”的绝境的。例如，炼铁设备能力的利用率，1952年每立方公尺高炉容积每昼夜产铁一吨左右，今年预计可达到一点三吨左右；炼钢炉（平炉）每平方公尺炉床面积每昼夜的产钢量，1952年只有四点七八吨，1957年提高到六点六七吨。但是，我们决不能认为钢铁设备能力不能再提高了。根据技术人员的估计，在炼铁方面，如果提高鼓风温度，采用高压炉顶和其他一些先进经验，生产能力可以再提高10％以上。在炼钢方面，如果采用氧气炼钢的方法或者改用新的耐火材料做炉顶，生产能力至少可提高20％以上。几年来生产实践证明了，只要把工人和技术人员发动起来，就可以不断创造出新的经验，从而不断的提高设备能力。因此，在计划中必须充分估计先进经验、先进技术的巨大意义，充分估计到人的能动作用，否则就会陷入保守主义的泥坑。
    我们还应该看到新建企业的巨大潜力。我国每年都有许多新建成的企业投入生产，这些企业的生产要经过相当的时间才达到设计的水平，采取措施缩短达到设计能力的时间，就可提高生产能力。同时，这些企业的设计能力一般都留有保险系数，经验证明可以在很大的幅度上超过设计的生产水平。以煤炭工业为例。依照计划上的惯例，一百五十万吨的机械化新立井，要经过四年左右，才能达到设计能力。投入生产的第一年生产能力还达不到设计能力的15％。但据若干矿井的工作人员反映，实际上只要两三年就可达到设计能力。苏联为我国设计的矿井，生产能力都是按每年生产三百天计算的，我们的实际生产时间为三百五十一天，可见超过设计能力是十分肯定的。
    第三是节约原料。　由于我国进行着大规模的经济建设，物资供应的紧张是不可避免的。因此，节约物资具有重大的经济意义。许多工业部门的生产受到原料不足的限制。因此，节约原料就等于增加生产。首先应该指出森林工业。由于各种原因，森林工业中木材浪费现象十分严重。据伊春森林工业管理局的初步调查，今年生产任务为二百八十万立方公尺，但弃置的木材（包括小径木，枝桠、伐根等）达一百三十三万立方公尺。这些木材很大一部分可以做工业原料。这种现象在全国林区都有。在木材加工方面，一般出材率仅为70％左右，板条板皮大约有20％左右。它们是很好的造纸原料，但大都被烧掉了。因此，提高运出木材的运出率和利用率，减少木材的浪费具有重大的意义。
    机械工业节约金属原料的潜力是很大的。例如北京机床一厂，生产万能铣床每台用料三千八百八十公斤，而齐齐哈尔机床厂生产同样的产品每台用料达四千三百九十六公斤。只要改进工艺过程，降低切削率，就可以大量节省原料。有许多机械设备，性能一样，重量相差却十分悬殊，有的甚至相差几倍。因此，随着产品设计的不断改进，节约金属的可能性是很大的。
    第四，在采掘工业中，提高工人的出勤率，从而提高劳动生产率，也是增加生产的重要途径。最近几年煤矿生产工人出勤率逐年下降，1955年出勤率达到92.32％，1956年为89.79％，1957年最高的一月（5月份）才只有87.4％。由于出勤率低，井下生产不正常，使采煤量大大降低。如果今年生产工人出勤率达到1955年的水平，就可以增加二百十八万个工作日，在其他条件正常的情况下，可以增产原煤二百五十万吨以上。我们是社会主义国家，具有一切条件来达到最高的出勤率。问题的关键在于积极采取措施，通过全民性的整风运动，提高工人的社会主义积极性。根据实际情况改变某些不完全符合按劳取酬原则的工资奖励制度，也会促使劳动生产率的提高。
    第五、正确地安排生产与需要之间的平衡，恰当地处理生产与储备的关系，也可以促进生产潜力的发挥和生产的正常增长。过去几年，我们的国家计划对生产与需要的安排，基本上是平衡的。但是，我们在考虑生产与需要的平衡时，往往只看到当年，缺乏瞻前顾后的比较长远的观点。例如1955年下半年，几乎所有的重要物资：煤炭、木材、生铁、钢材、水泥等等，都超过了需要。当时部分经济工作人员认为：与其生产出来“积压”在仓库里，占用流动资金，不如停止或减少生产，而没有考虑今后的需要，没有考虑储备。因此，1955年有若干主要产品的产量被压缩了。今天看来，这是一个教训。如果在1955年我们能更多地生产一些重要物资，储备起来，那么，不但1955年的生产不致于那样收缩，而且1956年生产高潮到来后所产生的物资供应的紧张局面，也可以大大缓和，并使1957年的生产能更好地进行。目前在计划工作人员中，仍然有人只顾当年需要，只要生产超过了当年需要量（那怕是今后国家十分需要的物资），就主张压缩生产指标。我认为，生铁、钢材、煤炭等重要物资，任何时候都应该充分发挥生产能力，积极生产。当然，在另一方面过分的不适当的强调储备也是不经济的。
    根据上面的分析，可以这样说：工业生产上的潜在力量是很大的，不仅现在有潜力，今后长时期内还有潜力。我们的经济计划必须充分考虑这些积极因素，必须具有先进的动员作用，推动和组织人们为发掘潜力增加生产而斗争。计划机关的任务，就在于不断地发现新的潜力，促进生产的进步和发展，而绝不能把主要注意力放在“控制生产”“防止冒进”压缩“过高的”生产指标上，当然这绝不是说要离开现实的经济条件而陷入空想主义的泥坑里去。
