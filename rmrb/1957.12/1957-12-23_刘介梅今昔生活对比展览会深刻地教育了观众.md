    Liu Jiemei's Past and Present Life Comparison Exhibition Profoundly Educates the Audience

    (Our report) The Liu Jiemei's Past and Present Life Comparison Exhibition held at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace has, to date, been visited by over one hundred thousand people. The majority of these people have watched the film "Liu Jiemei Forgets Her Roots and Turns Back." Visitors generally reflected after seeing the exhibition that "This is a vivid lesson in socialist education." Many people shed tears when they saw the miserable life of Liu Jiemei's family before liberation, suffering from exploitation and oppression.

    According to messages in the exhibition's "suggestion book" and feedback from many organizations after their visits and discussions, audiences have solved the following ideological problems through the visit: First, many viewers further realized that ideological transformation is more important in the socialist revolution period than at any time in the past, and that everyone must pass the socialist test well. For example, viewer Li Mingcheng wrote: "After seeing the exhibition, it made me clear about this truth: when a person is fascinated by capitalist ideas, no matter what kind of suffering you have experienced, you will definitely fall into the sinful capitalist abyss. Liu Jiemei was originally a flower that grew up in the land reform, but she... It is conceivable how much ideological transformation is needed for people like me who have never experienced hardship, and those from petty-bourgeois families!" Second, it changed some people's incorrect understanding of agricultural cooperativization, unified purchase and marketing, and farmers' lives, understood the truth of the countryside, and further recognized the true face of right-wing elements who oppose socialism. A young man from a bourgeois family wrote: "Cooperativization and unified purchase and marketing are really good, not 'bad' at all. Only by taking the socialist road can all farmers become rich together." Wu Wenbin wrote: "After cooperativization, I also fully believed some of the wrong information that my family reflected. From today on, I will examine my own thoughts." Third, through the visit, the audience saw the prospect of agricultural development, realized the importance of agricultural production in the national economy, and expressed their willingness to go to the countryside and mountains to build a new socialist countryside. Yan Ming wrote: "The exhibition has given me a profound education and further encouraged my determination to go to the countryside. I will definitely be a true member of the agricultural cooperative." PLA soldier He Weijie wrote: "After seeing the exhibition, I feel that I should hold the weapons in my hands more firmly, stand firm on the position of the working class, and defend the smooth development of a happy and prosperous socialist society."

    In order to educate more people, the exhibition has decided to appropriately expand the number of visitors admitted each day from now on, and is also preparing to publish some picture albums. (Pei Guoxun)

    刘介梅今昔生活对比展览会深刻地教育了观众
    本报讯  在北京劳动人民文化宫举办的刘介梅今昔生活对比展览会，到目前为止，参观人数已达十万以上。其中大部分人看了“刘介梅忘本回头”的电影。观众们参观展览会后，普遍反映：“这是一堂生动的社会主义教育课”。当他们看到刘介梅一家在解放前遭受剥削、压迫的悲惨生活时，不少人流下了眼泪。
    根据展览会“意见簿”上的留言及不少机关参观后座谈的反映，观众们通过参观，在思想上解决了如下几个问题：一、不少观众进一步认识到，在社会主义革命时期改造思想比过去任何时期更为重要，而且每个人必须要过好社会主义这一关。例如，观众李明成写道：“看了展览后，使我明确了这样一条真理：当一个人被资本主义思想迷了窍的时候，不管你受过什么样的苦，一定会掉进罪恶的资本主义深渊。刘介梅本来是土改中成长起来的一朵鲜花，但他却……。可想而知，像我这样从未经过艰苦的人，以及那些出身小资产阶级家庭的人，是多么需要脱胎换骨的思想改造啊！”二、改变了某些人对农业合作化、统购统销和农民生活的不正确认识，了解了农村的真相，进一步认清了右派分子反社会主义的本来面目。一个资产阶级家庭出身的青年写道：“合作化和统购统销真是好得很，而不是‘糟’的很。只有走社会主义道路，才能使全体农民共同富裕。”武文彬写道：“合作化以后，我对家庭反映的一些错误情况，也十分相信。从今天起，我要检查自己的思想了。”三、通过参观，观众们看到了农业发展的远景，认识到了农业生产在国民经济中的重要性，并纷纷表示要下乡、上山，建设社会主义新农村。燕鸣写道：展览会使我受到了深刻的教育，更鼓舞了我走向农村的决心，我一定去作个农业社的真正社员。”解放军战士何韦杰写道：“看过展览后，感到更应该紧握手中武器，站稳工人阶级的立场，保卫幸福繁荣的社会主义社会顺利地向前发展。”
    为了使更多的人能受到教育，展览会决定从现在起每天再适当扩大接纳参观的人数，还准备出一些画册。  （裴国勋）
