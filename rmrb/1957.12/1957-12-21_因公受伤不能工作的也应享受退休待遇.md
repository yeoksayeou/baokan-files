    Those Injured on Duty and Unable to Work Should Also Enjoy Retirement Benefits

    After reading the four draft regulations promulgated by the State Council, I feel that only in a country led by the Communist Party can workers and staff receive such care and attention. In addition to my heartfelt support, I would like to offer a suggestion. I believe that those who are injured on duty and unable to continue working, even if they have not reached retirement age, should still be treated as general retirees. Their post-retirement benefits should not be too low and can be handled in accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 3 of the "Provisional Regulations (Draft) of the State Council on the Handling of Retirement for Workers and Staff."

    因公受伤不能工作的也应享受退休待遇
    看了国务院公布的四项规定草案以后，觉得只有在共产党领导的国家里，工人职员才会得到这样的关怀和照顾。我除了衷心地拥护以外，提出一点意见。我认为因公受伤不能继续工作的人，虽未达退休年龄，仍应照一般退休人员处理。他们退休后的待遇不能过低，可以按照“国务院关于工人、职员退休处理的暂行规定（草案）”第四条第三项办理。
