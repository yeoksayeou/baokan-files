    This Winter's Rural Market
    Huì Píng
    The distribution of income by agricultural cooperatives after the autumn harvest largely determines the extent of industrial product sales in the rural market during the winter. If income distribution is high, the market may be more prosperous than last year. If cash distribution is early, the market will become prosperous earlier; if cash distribution is delayed, the peak season will also be postponed.
    Nationwide, this year's main crops have had a good harvest, better than last year. The area of increased production is large, and the area of reduced production is small. The total value of national purchases of grain, cash crops, and native products is expected to increase by 2.05 billion yuan compared to last year. Therefore, this winter's purchasing power of farmers will definitely be higher than last year. This is the decisive factor in whether this winter's peak season will be prosperous and to what extent. After the Third Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, a proposal was made to expand the proportion of public accumulation in agricultural cooperatives. The individual purchasing power of some members who purchase consumer goods will be transferred to the collective purchasing power for means of production. The proportion of this increased public accumulation will generally increase by 3% to 4%. This collective purchasing power will be concentrated on farmland water conservancy equipment and other means of production related to rural infrastructure construction. However, in areas with increased production, even if public accumulation is expanded and agricultural loans are repaid, the cash distributed to cooperative members individually will generally still increase compared to last year.
    So, why haven't markets been very prosperous in most of the increased production areas until the beginning of November? This is mainly because the advance cash distribution by agricultural cooperatives has been delayed. Last year, a large amount of cash obtained by agricultural cooperatives from selling agricultural and sideline products was distributed as it was received. More cash was distributed in advance, and less cash was distributed at the final settlement. Therefore, the rural market was prosperous earlier last year. This year, the principle of income distribution has been changed to prioritizing the state, then the collective, and finally the members. The income of agricultural cooperatives should first be used to repay various loans. As for the cash that should be distributed to the members, most of it is retained in credit cooperatives and only distributed to the members during the final settlement. The final settlement generally takes place in December. The earliest settlements start at the end of November, and the later ones are postponed to January of next year.
    The proportion of cash distributed to cooperative members by agricultural cooperatives in September and October this year is relatively small compared to the income of agricultural cooperatives. This is the basic factor for the lack of market prosperity in September and October this year. Taking Liaoning Province as an example, last year, advance cash distribution before the third quarter accounted for 30% to 40% of the total income, while this year it generally does not exceed 20%. On October 9th, Leizhen Cooperative in Jinxian, Hebei, distributed the first batch of cash from the autumn harvest to its members. Members received only two jiao per labor day, accounting for only 9% of the cash they should have received.
    Last year, agricultural cooperatives distributed cash early, and there was a large amount of cash distributed in advance. In many areas, the advance cash distribution was too large, and there were deficits during the final settlement. Therefore, it is necessary to repay last year's deficits in this year's advance distribution. Reflected in last year's rural market, the farmers' purchasing power also contained false and abnormal factors. At that time, the farmers' mindset was generally that since so much cash was distributed in advance, the cash distributed at the final settlement would definitely be even more, so they spent money very quickly and extravagantly. In many areas, there was a phenomenon of one family buying three or five woolen sweaters and five or six pairs of cloth shoes at a time. Under the impact of farmers, supply and marketing cooperatives turned around and vigorously procured industrial products, so the peak season arrived very quickly. This year, the situation has changed. These abnormal factors have disappeared with the deepening of the socialist debate in rural areas. In particular, the education on running cooperatives diligently and frugally and managing households diligently and frugally has taken root in people's hearts. Farmers may be more planned in their spending, the phenomenon of eating and spending extravagantly will decrease, and savings will definitely increase. However, the need for daily-use industrial products is still diverse and complex. Especially in areas that suffered disasters last year but had a good harvest this year, the farmers' demand for industrial products is combined for two years, and the task of supplying industrial products will definitely be arduous. Therefore, commercial departments in various regions need to specifically study the income distribution plans of local agricultural cooperatives, grasp the timing of cash distribution by agricultural cooperatives, pay attention to the trends of the rural market, so as to do a good job in the arduous task of supplying industrial products.

    今冬的农村市场
    会萍
    农业社秋后的收益分配，在很大程度上决定着农村市场冬季工业品旺销的程度。收益分配多，市场就可能比去年更旺。现金分配的时间早，市场就会随着早旺；现金分配迟，旺季也就会推迟。
    从全国范围看，今年主要农作物是丰收的，年成比去年好。增产地区大，减产地区小。今年全国粮食、经济作物、土特产品的收购总值预计比去年增加二十亿五千万元，因而，今年冬季的农民购买力肯定会比去年高，这是今冬旺季会不会旺，旺到什么程度的决定性因素。党中央三中全会以后，提出扩大农业社公共积累的比例，一部分购买生活资料的社员个人购买力，将要转移到购买生产资料的集团购买力方面去，这部分公共积累扩大的比例，一般增大3％—4％。这部分集团购买力，将集中在农田水利器材和其他有关农村基本建设的生产资料方面。但是，在增产的地区，即使扩大了公共积累，归还了到期的农贷，而分配给社员个人的现金，一般仍要比去年增加。
    那么，为什么在大多数的增产地区，直到11月上旬，市场还未大旺呢？这主要是农业社的现金预分推迟了。农业社出售农副产品所得的大量现金，去年是随收随分的。预分现金多，决分现金少，因而去年农村市场旺的早。今年收益分配的原则改为先国家、次集体、后社员。农业社的收益，首先要还清各项贷款，至于应当分配给社员的现金，大部分留存在信用社，待决分时才分给社员，而决分时间，一般都要到12月份才能进行。早的也是从11月底才开始，迟的还要推延到明年1月份。
    今年9、10月间农业社分配给社员个人的现金数量所占农业社收入的比重较小，是今年9、10月市场未旺的基本因素。以辽宁省为例：去年三季度以前预分现金占总收入的30％—40％，今年一般不超过20％。河北晋县雷阵社10月9日才把秋收第一批现金分给社员，社员每个劳动日先分两角，仅占应分现金的9％。
    去年农业社的现金分配早，预分时现金多，很多地区预分现金过大，决分时发生倒差，因而要在今年的预分中，归还去年的倒差。反映在去年农村市场上，农民的购买力也就包含着虚假的不正常的因素。当时农民的思想情绪，一般认为预分的现金那么多，决分的现金当然更多，因而花钱很猛，大吃大花。不少地区出现一家一次购买三、五件绒衣，五、六双布胶鞋的现象，供销社在农民的冲击状态下，回过头来大进大抓工业品，因而旺季来势很猛。今年情况变化了，这些不正常的因素，随着农村社会主义大辩论的深入而消失了，尤其是勤俭办社、勤俭持家的教育，深入人心，农民在花钱方面就可能更有计划，大吃大花的现象将会减少，储蓄必将增长。但是，日用工业品的需要仍然是多样的、复杂的。尤其是去年受灾、今年丰收的地区，农民对工业品的需要，两年挤在一道，工业品的供应任务，必将是繁重的。因此，各地商业部门都需要具体研究当地农业社的收益分配方案，掌握农业社分配现金的时间，注意农村市场的动向，以做好繁重的工业品供应工作。（附图片）
