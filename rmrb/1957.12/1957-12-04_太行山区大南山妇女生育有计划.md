　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 3rd. Since the promotion of the benefits of contraception began this spring in Danaan Mountain Village in Lin County, Taihang Mountains, women are now gradually practicing planned childbearing.
　　Among the two hundred and two women of childbearing age in Danaan Mountain Village, only one became pregnant in the months of August, September and October, while nine became pregnant in June and July. Compared with the period from February to May when no publicity was carried out, twenty-nine women became pregnant at that time.
　　In recent years, Danaan Mountain Village has averaged eighty births per year, but this year it has been relatively reduced.
　　In the village's three hundred and seventy-five households, sixteen women used to suffer from frequent illnesses due to excessive childbearing, rendering them unable to work in the fields. Among the one hundred and eighteen women in the village with three or more children, they could only work in the fields for an average of thirty days per year. Since the health department began publicizing contraception here this spring, contraception has become common knowledge for every household.

　  太行山区大南山妇女生育有计划
    新华社郑州3日电　太行山区林县大南山村，从今春宣传避孕的好处以后，现在妇女们已逐渐做到有计划地生育孩子。
    大南山村二百零二个正在生育年龄的妇女，在8、9、10三个月内怀孕的只有一人，6、7两个月内怀孕的有九人。同没有进行宣传的2月到5月比较，当时怀孕的有二十九人。
    大南山村近几年来每年平均要生八十个小孩，今年相对地减少了。
    这个村三百七十五户中，有十六户的妇女过去因为生育子女过多，身体经常有病，不能下地劳动。全村有三个孩子以上的一百一十八个妇女，她们全年平均只能下地三十天。从今春开始，卫生部门在这里进行宣传以后，避孕已成为家喻户晓的常识了。
