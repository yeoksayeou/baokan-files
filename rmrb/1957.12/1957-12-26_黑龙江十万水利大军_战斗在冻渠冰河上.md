Xinhua News Agency Report: A high tide of winter water conservancy construction has emerged in the vast rural areas of Heilongjiang Province. 110,000 farmers are braving the severe cold of minus 20 degrees Celsius, working day and night on frozen canals and icy rivers.

"Conquer nature and extract grain from water" has become the farmers' heroic slogan for seizing the time and building water conservancy projects in the severe cold. Despite the ice and snow, more than 100,000 laborers are still bravely marching toward frozen ground and icy rivers, digging canals and building dams to prepare for diverting water uphill. In order to ensure both the progress and quality of the project during winter construction, the farmers have given full play to collective wisdom and creativity. They have adopted a three-shift system, working continuously day and night to prevent the soil from freezing. Some have also created methods such as "pressing the edges before finishing work" and "forward advancing and backward soil dumping" to ensure the progress and quality of the project. Youth shock teams and groups are particularly active. Wuchang County has established 264 youth shock teams with more than 10,000 members. The Changan irrigation area jointly built by Changbu and other nine townships in the county has 13 youth shock teams. They are active on the 40-mile-long construction site, appearing wherever there are difficulties. They over-fulfill their tasks every day and ensure quality. Due to the accelerated winter construction, half of the province's paddy field and drainage projects have been completed.

    黑龙江十万水利大军
    战斗在冻渠冰河上
    据新华社讯　黑龙江省广大农村出现了水利工程冬季施工高潮。十一万农民正冒着零下二十度的严寒，日夜战斗在冻渠冰河上。
    “征服大自然，向水索取粮食”已成为农民们争取时间，在严寒中兴修水利工程的豪迈口号。尽管现在冰封雪飘，十多万劳动大军，仍然奋勇地向冻地、冰河进军，挖渠、修坝，为引水上山，作好准备工作。为了在冬季施工中既保证工程进度又保证质量，农民们发挥了集体智慧和创造，他们采取三班制，日夜连续施工，不让土冻住，有的还创造了“收工前压槎子”和“前进倒土法”等方法，保证了工程进度和质量。青年们组成的突击队、组，特别活跃。五常县建立了二百六十四个青年突击队，拥有一万多名队员。这个县常卜等九个乡联合修的常安灌区就有十三个青年突击队，他们活跃在四十里长的工地上，那里有困难，他们就出现在那里，每天都超额完成了任务，并保证了质量。由于冬季施工的加速进行，全省水田和排涝工程已完成了总工程量的半数。
