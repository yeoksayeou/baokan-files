    The Second Congress of the Communist Party of China in Zhejiang Province, its second session, was a rectification conference. By conveying and studying the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and by using the methods of extensive airing of views, big debates, presenting facts, and reasoning, the comrades attending the meeting correctly understood the current situation, unified their understanding of major policies such as agricultural production, cooperation, and unified purchase and sale of grain; and through the debate on the National Agricultural Development Program and the issue of developing industrial production, they stirred up everyone's revolutionary enthusiasm to strive for a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production throughout the province. What is particularly worth pointing out is that this meeting also thoroughly exposed the right-wing elements hidden within the Party's leading organs, and seriously criticized their anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes, thereby greatly enhancing everyone's socialist consciousness and further purifying and consolidating the Party organization. This victory is a great victory for the Party Central Committee's rectification policy, and a great victory for the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. This victory will inevitably have a profound impact on strengthening the ideological and organizational construction of Party organizations throughout the province, and on promoting the rapid development of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in this province.
    The results of this meeting vividly illustrate that rectification is the key to all work. In all tasks, only by grasping rectification and adopting the methods of extensive airing of views, big debates, and writing big-character posters can we thoroughly solve the problems that need to be solved. This meeting implemented the mass line method of having the comrades attending the meeting come up with topics and write articles themselves, posting more than 7,000 big-character posters and more than 20,000 opinions. Most of these opinions were correct, but they also revealed differences on certain policy issues. The big debates launched to resolve these differences made everyone seriously use their brains, painstakingly study, present contradictions, find evidence, reason, refute arguments, and work day and night, fully demonstrating their enthusiasm and creativity. The process of big debates is a process of fully exposing contradictions and gradually unifying thinking, a process of gradually distinguishing between right and wrong, and also a process of mobilizing the masses and relying on the collective wisdom and collective strength of the masses to carry out self-education and self-transformation.
    The first problem encountered at this meeting was why, in the past year, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao had already given many instructions on the current situation, but many comrades in our Zhejiang Party organization still had differing views on this issue. The debate showed that it is not easy to correctly understand the important instructions of the Central Committee without big debates and without one's own practice. Some people fail to see that in the current situation, the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism is still sharp, and that the contradiction between the bourgeois right-wingers and the working people is an antagonistic contradiction, and thus show serious political wavering and sentimentalism in the anti-rightist struggle. Others exaggerate the antagonistic contradiction, believing that the struggle between the two roads is all an antagonistic contradiction, and thus doubt the correctness and possibility of using the method of persuasion and education to handle contradictions among the people. After conscientiously studying the instructions of the Central Committee, presenting a large number of facts, and launching heated debates, everyone clearly realized that: during the transition period, the struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road, and the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, are still the main contradictions in our country. This contradiction can be manifested as contradictions among the people, and it can also be manifested as antagonistic contradictions. However, under the current conditions in our country, the former is the majority, while the latter is a relatively small number. Judging from the situation of the extensive airing of views and the disturbances that occurred in some areas in the first half of the year in this province, the vast majority belong to contradictions among the people. Right-wing elements and other anti-socialist elements took advantage of our correct handling of contradictions among the people to launch frantic attacks against the Party and socialism, but extremes beget their opposites, and when their reactionary faces were fully exposed, they aroused the righteous indignation of the broad masses, who rose up to wage a resolute struggle against them. This tells us that we must firmly believe in the majority of the masses. Right-wing elements and other enemies who oppose socialism are, after all, a very small minority. It is wrong to ignore antagonistic contradictions, but it is also wrong to exaggerate antagonistic contradictions to the point of regarding the wavering and dissatisfaction of ordinary bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals towards socialism as antagonistic contradictions, or to regard the wavering and dissatisfaction of well-to-do middle peasants towards socialism as antagonistic contradictions, and attempt to use suppression to deal with these contradictions.
    During the discussion of the National Agricultural Development Program at this meeting, another question arose, namely, why on the one hand, a large number of advanced and high-yield examples have emerged, such as the average grain yield per mu in Huangyan, Wenling, and the suburbs of Wenzhou has reached more than 800 jin, and the average cotton yield per mu in Cixi has also reached more than 100 jin, etc., while on the other hand, the grain yield in eleven counties including Longyou, Qu County, Tiantai, and Lishui in 1956 was still lower than that in 1952, and some counties even experienced year-on-year declines. What is the reason for this? The result of the debate showed that the quality of production reflects whether the leadership uses advanced ideas to guide production or conservative ideas to guide production, and reflects whether the leadership style is a mass line and realistic approach, or a bureaucratic and subjectivist approach. Those with right-leaning conservative ideas often emphasize many objective reasons, such as saying that "production has reached its peak," to defend their erroneous ideas. However, facts have proved that high-yield areas such as Huangyan and Wenling can still make further progress. They also emphasize that natural conditions are poor and production cannot be increased, but facts have proved that the natural conditions in Lin'an are far inferior to those in Longyou and Qu County, while the average grain yield per mu in Lin'an is more than 200 jin higher than that in Longyou and Qu County. They also emphasize that water conservancy conditions in mountainous areas are poor and difficult to change, but the meeting presented examples of the masses in Xialiang Township, Huangyan County, moving mountains to build dams and diverting water over mountains to achieve large-scale high yields. A large number of facts have proved that the various excuses of right-leaning conservative ideas are untenable. It all depends on human effort. Wherever the leadership is energetic, has clear goals, actively adopts various effective measures to increase production, and uses the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains to overcome all difficulties; and at the same time, resolutely implements the methods of leadership taking the lead, going deep into reality, summarizing advanced experiences, and organizing promotion, mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses, and combining energy with the mass line and realistic methods. In this way, it is certain that a great leap forward in agricultural production can be achieved.
    At this meeting, through extensive airing of views, big debates, the major issues of right and wrong that had long existed within the Zhejiang Party organization were also thoroughly resolved. Why couldn't the provincial party committee achieve ideological unity on certain policy issues, and why did difficulties arise in implementation? The answer was found at this meeting. The existence of these problems within the Party was due to the consistent use of the mantles of "old Party members" and "senior cadres" by right-wing elements Sha Wenhan, Yang Si, Peng Ruilin, and Sun Zhanglu to carry out a series of anti-Party sectarian activities. And they persisted in their mistakes for a long time, refusing the Party's criticism and education, believing that their political capital was very large, as if their butts could not be touched. Through several months of anti-rightist struggle, the political consciousness of the broad masses of Party members has been rapidly raised, and the six political criteria put forward by Chairman Mao have given everyone a powerful weapon to distinguish between right and wrong. During the extensive airing of views at this meeting, everyone exposed their anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes in large numbers, revealing their true colors and completely isolating them. This fact proves that anti-Party elements cannot stand the light of day, they are afraid of the truth, and they are afraid of the masses. When the broad masses sharpened their eyes in the struggle, raised their fighting spirit, and exposed more and more facts, and the lines between right and wrong became clearer and clearer, the reactionary faces of the right-wing elements were thoroughly exposed among the masses.
    This meeting, in the extensive airing of views, big debates, not only exposed the enemy, but more importantly, educated themselves, so that the main backbone of Party organizations at all levels in the province received an extremely profound education. What everyone felt most deeply was that bourgeois individualism is incompatible with communism and collectivism. Whether a Communist Party member wholeheartedly strives selflessly for the cause of the Party and the people, or is constantly preoccupied with personal gains and losses and personal grievances, is a fundamental issue of the fundamentally different standpoints of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. People with serious bourgeois individualist ideas often do not think about the cause of the Party and the people, but first consider their personal reputation, status, and treatment. When their personal desires for fame and fortune are relatively satisfied, they may temporarily appear to be more active; when their personal goals are not achieved, they will develop dissatisfaction with the Party, develop liberalism and sectarianism, and even refuse to accept the Party's criticism and advice, and finally embark on the road of opposing the Party. The facts exposed at the meeting prove that right-wing elements are all extremely selfish bourgeois individualists. If individualism is not overcome in its embryonic stage, it will inevitably spread and grow until it becomes uncontrollable. Individualism is the root of all evil and is one of the main targets of the current socialist ideological revolution. Only by constantly educating all Party members with the ideas of communism and collectivism, and constantly guarding against the encroachment of bourgeois individualist ideas on the Party's ranks, can we strengthen the revolutionary will of the broad masses of Party members, invigorate their spirits, and strive selflessly for the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction with vigor and vitality.
    The gains of this rectification meeting are extremely great: the right-wing elements hidden within the Party have been cleared out, various erroneous ideas and tendencies within the Party have been criticized, and as a result, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of Party members has been rapidly raised, and their enthusiasm for building socialism has greatly increased. This proves that: there can be no construction without destruction, and contradictions cannot be correctly resolved without thoroughly exposing them. If we want to destroy capitalism and establish socialism, and if we want to correctly resolve various contradictory problems, we must resolutely carry out the rectification movement to the end, firmly believe in the majority of the masses, and frequently use the methods of extensive airing of views, big debates, and writing big-character posters in all our work. If we learn this lesson, we will be able to better implement the spirit of this Party Congress and greatly advance all aspects of the province's work.

    整风运动的巨大胜利
    ——浙江日报十二月二十七日社论
    中共浙江省第二届代表大会第二次会议，是一次整风大会。会议通过传达和学习党的八届三中全会精神，运用了大鸣大放、大辩论、摆事实、讲道理的方法，使到会同志正确地认识了目前的形势，统一了对于农业生产、合作化和粮食统购统销等重大政策的认识；并且通过对于全国农业发展纲要和发展工业生产问题的辩论，鼓起了大家努力争取全省工农业生产大跃进的革命劲头。特别值得指出来的是，这次会议还彻底揭发了隐藏在党的领导机关内的右派分子，严肃批判了他们的反党反社会主义罪行，从而大大地提高了大家的社会主义觉悟，进一步纯洁和巩固了党的组织。这个胜利是党中央的整风方针的一次巨大胜利，是社会主义同资本主义两条道路斗争的一次巨大胜利。这个胜利，对于加强全省党组织的思想建设和组织建设，对于促进本省社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，都必然会发生极为深刻的影响。
    这次会议的成果生动地说明：整风是提起一切工作的纲。在各项工作中，只有抓住整风，采取大鸣大放大争大辩的方法，才能够彻底解决应当解决的问题。这次会议实行了由到会同志自己出题目、做文章的群众路线的方法，前后共贴出七千多张大字报，两万多条意见。这些意见大部分是正确的，但同时也暴露出在某些方针政策问题上的分歧。为着解决这些分歧而展开的大辩论，使得每个人都认真地开动脑筋，刻苦钻研，摆矛盾，找根据，讲道理，驳论点，夜以继日地工作，充分发挥了积极性和创造性。大辩论的过程就是一个充分暴露矛盾、逐步统一思想的过程，是一个逐步分清大是大非界线的过程，也是一个发动群众和依靠群众的集体智慧和集体力量进行自我教育和自我改造的过程。
    这次会议首先遇到的问题，就是为什么近一年来党中央和毛主席对于目前形势问题已经有了许多指示，而我们浙江党组织内不少同志对这个问题的看法仍然是有分歧的。辩论的情况说明：对于中央的重要指示不经过大辩论、不经过自己的实践，是不容易正确理解的。一部分人看不到在目前形势下，社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争仍然是尖锐的，看不到资产阶级右派同劳动人民之间的矛盾是敌我矛盾，因而在反右派斗争中表现出严重的政治动摇和温情主义。另一部分人则夸大了敌我矛盾，认为两条道路的斗争一概是敌我矛盾，因而怀疑用说服教育的方法去处理人民内部矛盾的正确性和可能性。经过认真学习中央的指示，摆出大量的事实，展开热烈的辩论，大家才明确地认识到：在过渡时期内，社会主义道路同资本主义道路的斗争，无产阶级同资产阶级的斗争，仍然是我国国内的主要矛盾。这种矛盾，既可以表现为人民内部矛盾，也可以表现为敌我矛盾。但是，在我国目前的条件下，前者是大量的，而后者是比较少数的。从本省上半年大鸣大放和部分地区所发生的闹事的情况看来，绝大多数都属于人民内部矛盾。右派分子和其他反社会主义分子利用我们正确处理人民内部矛盾的时机，向党向社会主义猖狂进攻，但是，物极必反，当他们的反动面目充分暴露的时候，就激起了广大群众的义愤，群众就起来向他们作坚决的斗争。这就告诉我们：必须坚定地相信群众的大多数。右派分子和其他反对社会主义的敌人毕竟是极少数。忽视敌我矛盾是错误的，但是夸大敌我矛盾，以至把不属于右派的一般资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子对于社会主义的动摇和不满都看作敌我矛盾，或者把富裕中农对于社会主义的动摇和不满也看作敌我矛盾，企图用压服的方法来处理这些矛盾，也是错误的。
    这次会议在讨论全国农业发展纲要的时候，又出现了这样的问题，即为什么一方面涌现了大量的先进丰产事例，例如黄岩、温岭和温州市郊区的粮食产量平均每亩已经达到八百斤以上，慈溪的棉花产量平均每亩也达到一百斤以上，等等，而另一方面，却还有龙游、衢县、天台、丽水等十一个县1956年的粮食产量比1952年还要减少，有的县甚至年年减产。这是什么原故呢？辩论的结果说明：生产状况的好坏，反映了领导上是用先进的思想来指导生产还是用保守思想来指导生产，反映了领导作风是群众路线、实事求是的作风，还是官僚主义、主观主义的作风。具有右倾保守思想的人，往往强调许多客观原因，例如说“生产到顶”了，来为他们的这种错误思想辩护。但是，事实证明：像黄岩、温岭等高产量地区仍然可以百尺竿头、更进一步。他们还强调自然条件差，不能增产，但是，事实证明，临安的自然条件远不如龙游和衢县，而临安的粮食平均每亩产量却比龙游、衢县高过二百多斤。他们还强调山区的水利条件差，难以改变，但是，会议中就出现了像黄岩县下梁乡群众移山开坝、引水过山、获得大面积丰产的事例。大量的事实证明，右倾保守思想的种种借口都是站不住脚的。事在人为，凡是领导上有劲头，有明确的奋斗目标，积极采用各种有效的增产措施，用愚公移山的精神来克服一切困难；同时，又坚决地实行领导动手、深入实际、总结先进、组织推广的方法，发动群众和依靠群众，把劲头和群众路线、实事求是的方法结合起来。这样，就一定能够争取农业生产来一个大跃进。
    这次会议，通过大鸣大放大辩论，还彻底解决了浙江党组织内长期以来存在着的大是大非问题。为什么在省委内部对某些方针政策问题思想上不能取得一致，贯彻执行中发生困难？在这次会议中得到了答案。党内存在着这些问题，是由于右派分子沙文汉、杨思一、彭瑞林、孙章录等人一贯地利用“老党员”、“高级干部”等外衣，进行了一系列的反党宗派活动。并且长期坚持错误，拒绝党对他们的批评教育，自以为政治资本很大，好像老虎屁股是摸不得的。经过几个月来的反右派斗争，广大党员的政治觉悟迅速地提高了，毛主席所提出的六项政治标准，给了大家明辨是非的有力武器。在这次会议大鸣大放当中，大家大量地揭发了他们的反党反社会主义的罪行，使他们显出了原形，完全陷于孤立。这个事实证明：反党分子是见不得太阳的，他们害怕真理，害怕群众。当广大群众在斗争中擦亮了眼睛，提高了斗志，揭发的事实越来越多，是非界线越来越清楚，右派分子的反动面貌就在群众中彻底暴露了。
    这次会议在大鸣大放大争大辩中，不仅揭发了敌人，更重要的是教育了自己，使全省各级党组织的主要骨干都受到一次极为深刻的教育。大家体会得最深的是：资产阶级个人主义是同共产主义、集体主义不相容的。一个共产党员，是全心全意为着党和人民的事业而忘我地奋斗，还是念念不忘个人得失和个人恩怨，这是无产阶级同资产阶级两个根本不同的立场问题。一个具有严重的资产阶级个人主义思想的人，他们往往不是为党和人民的事业着想，而是首先为个人的名誉、地位和待遇作打算，当他们的个人名利欲望得到比较满足的时候，他们可能暂时表现得比较积极；当他们的个人目的达不到的时候，就会滋长起对党不满，发展自由主义、宗派主义活动，以至拒不接受党的批评和劝告，最后走上反党的道路。会议中揭露的事实证明：右派分子都是一些极端自私自利的资产阶级个人主义者。个人主义如果在萌芽状态时不加以克服，就必然会蔓延滋长，以至不可收拾。个人主义是万恶根源，是当前社会主义思想革命中的主要对象之一。只有经常地以共产主义、集体主义的思想教育全体党员，经常地警惕资产阶级个人主义思想对党的队伍的侵袭，才能坚定广大党员的革命意志，振作精神，生气勃勃地为社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业忘我地奋斗。
    这次整风会议的收获是十分巨大的：清除了隐藏在党内的右派分子，批判了党内各种错误思想和倾向，随之而来的是广大党员的社会主义觉悟迅速提高，建设社会主义的劲头大大高涨起来。这证明了：不破不立，不彻底暴露矛盾就不能正确地解决矛盾。我们要破资本主义、立社会主义，要正确地解决各种矛盾问题，就必须坚决地把整风运动贯彻到底，坚定地相信群众的大多数，在一切工作中经常运用大鸣大放大辩论和出大字报的方法。学会了这一条，就能够更好地贯彻执行这次党代表大会的精神，把全省各项工作大大地向前推进一步。
