　　Across the Roof of the World
　　——Notes on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway Survey
    By our reporter, Yan Shugui

    The aerial survey work for the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, which crosses the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, was completed as early as July. The next step was to go deep into the field to check these aerial photographs, investigate the geological terrain along the route, collect economic data along the route, and make comparative plans for local lines. The Qinghai-Tibet Railway survey personnel of the First Survey and Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways, shouldering this arduous mission, spent more than two months in this place, which is four to five thousand meters above sea level and known as the roof of the world, traveling back and forth nearly three thousand kilometers, and finally completed the survey work for the line. They collected valuable data for the construction of this railway.

    Red Flag Planted on the Kunlun Mountains

    Golmud was very hot in the summer. As soon as the survey personnel appeared, swarms of mosquitoes and horseflies followed them, forcing everyone to wear masks while working, and constantly wield fly swatters. However, when they moved more than a hundred kilometers southwest to the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains—Xidatan—it was already snowing heavily, and the cold wind was biting, as if winter had arrived. They continued to advance towards the top of the Kunlun Mountains. After arranging accommodation in Luansh溝, they climbed the Twelve Steps Mountain, which is 4,800 meters above sea level, to carry out baseline measurements.

    Twelve Steps Mountain is the highest point of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, with thin air and low air pressure. This brought many difficulties to the survey personnel, including shortness of breath, headaches, dizziness, and inconvenience of movement. They were all strong and sturdy young men. After selecting the points, they picked up their picks and hit hard, wishing they could plant the stakes in two or three strokes and immediately start the next step. Who knew that after only two or three strikes, several people vomited and lay on the ground unable to breathe. Later, everyone figured out an experience: smash slowly, and several people take turns. When carrying out distance measurement and real observation, the wind and snow on the Kunlun Mountains were the most difficult. The snow light stung people's eyes, the wind blew people's eyes so they couldn't open them, and they couldn't stand still. Everyone had to stand with their backs to the wind and squint their eyes. However, because the wind was too strong, the plumb bob on the instrument was always not straight, and the steel ruler could not be pulled apart. Fortunately, they encountered two sunny days, which made it relatively smooth to complete the baseline measurement work, and found a relatively ideal pass for the railway to pass through the Kunlun Mountains: the altitude is lower than the highway, and the terrain is flatter than the highway.

    Climbing over the Tanggula Mountains

    Leaving the Kunlun Mountains, passing through the steep Hoh Xil and Fenghuo Mountains, and crossing the Tongtian River and the Taotao River, the survey personnel entered the second large mountain on the line—the Tanggula Mountains, which are five to six thousand meters above sea level.

    The geological conditions under the Tanggula Mountains are very special. Dozens of centimeters underground is the permafrost layer that does not melt all year round. How the railway passes through here is a difficult problem for railway construction. In order to provide accurate data for future design work, they carried out excavation here to check the various conditions of the permafrost layer. In this permanently frozen place, the water for locomotives in the future is a big problem. The Tanggula Mountains are more than forty kilometers up and down, and the slope is as high as twenty per thousand (generally only twelve per thousand), and the train needs double-locomotive traction to pass. Especially because of the high altitude and thin air, the locomotives need more water. In order to find water, they specially surveyed the Tanggula Mountain Sea, which is formed by the melting of snow mountain glaciers. This inland lake is surrounded by swamps, and it is not easy to get to the lake. The survey personnel, leaning on walking sticks, stepped on clumps of moss on the swamp, and spent a lot of effort to bypass the lake. The east-west length of the lake is as long as ten miles, and the north-south width is two or three miles. The snow water on the surrounding snow mountains is still flowing into it day and night. This is an ideal water supply station, and locomotives climbing over the Tanggula Mountains in the future will no longer have to worry about running out of water.

    Guide Deng Zhuociren

    After passing through the Yangbajing Stone Gorge and arriving in Lhasa, the survey personnel traveled to the Bangduo River area northeast of Lhasa, and surveyed the Hei Zhugongka line plan along the mountains and ridges of the Tanggula Mountains. This is one of the prosperous agricultural areas in Tibet and also a densely populated area. When the farmers along the route heard that the people surveying the railway had come, they rushed to tell each other. Some sent milk and cheese for the guests to eat, and some vacated the best houses for the guests to live in.

    Deng Zhuociren is a 23-year-old Tibetan youth and a strong assistant to the survey personnel. During the journey, he was both a skilled guide and a diligent breeder. No matter how high the mountain or how rapid the water, as long as you tell him the direction you want to go, he always takes the lead and skillfully finds a path to pass through. Before the end of work in the evening, he needs to find a place to stay, and he whips his horse and quickly disappears into the green fields. When the survey personnel arrived at the planned place of rest, he had already prepared the house, pot, water, and firewood. At night, he got up several times to add grass to the livestock. Early the next morning, he had prepared the saddle and started a new journey. It was precisely because of his enthusiastic work that this local line was completed in nine days.

    Now, the survey work of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway has been completed. According to the data collected, the survey personnel have selected a main line plan from Golmud to Lhasa, with a total length of 1,200 kilometers, with reference to aerial photographs. The collected data shows that the entire Qinghai-Tibet Railway, except for key projects such as the Kunlun Mountains, the Tanggula Mountains, and the Yangbajing Stone Gorge, is mostly flat, and the construction project is not large.

　　横跨世界屋脊
　　——青藏铁路踏勘散记
    本报记者　燕树桂
    跨越青藏大高原的青藏铁路航空测量工作，早在7月份就完成了。紧接着的工作便是深入现场，核对这些航空照片，调查了解沿线地质地形，搜集沿线经济资料，作出局部线路的比较方案。铁道部第一设计院青藏铁路踏勘人员，负着这个艰巨的使命，用了两个多月时间，在这个拔海四五千公尺、号称世界屋脊的地方，来回奔走了近三千公里，终于完成了线路的踏勘工作，为修建这条铁路搜集了宝贵的资料。
    红旗插上昆仑山
    夏天的噶尔穆非常炎热。踏勘人员一出现，成群的蚊子、牛虻便跟踪而来，逼得大家戴着面罩工作，手里还不时出动着蝇甩子。可是当他们再向西南走百多公里，到达昆仑山北坡——西大滩时，已是大雪纷飞，寒风凛冽，俨然冬天来临了。他们继续向昆仑山顶挺进。在乱石沟安排下住处后，他们就爬上拔海四千八百公尺的十二步山，进行基线测量。
    十二步山，是青藏公路最高的地方，空气稀薄，气压低。这给踏勘人员带来很多困难，呼吸紧迫，头痛目眩，行动不便。他们都是身强力壮的青年，点子选好后，就拿起镐头猛力的打，恨不得两三下就把桩子栽好，马上着手下一步工作。谁知打不了两三下，有几个人就呕吐起来，躺在地上喘不过气来了。后来，大家摸索出一条经验：慢慢的砸，几个人换着干。在进行测距和真正观测的时候，昆仑山上的风雪最刁难人了。雪光刺得人眼睛痛，风吹得人眼睛睁不开，立也立不稳。大家只好背着风眯着眼站着。可是由于风太大，仪器上的线铊总垂不直，钢尺总拉不开。幸亏遇上两天晴朗天气，才比较顺利地完成了基线测量工作，并且给铁路通过昆仑山找到一个比较理想的垭口：海拔比公路低，地势比公路平坦。
    爬过大唐古拉山
    离开昆仑山，穿过山势险要的霍霍西里、风火山，跨过通天河和滔滔河，踏勘人员就进入线路上第二座大山——拔海五六千公尺的大唐古拉山。
    唐古拉山下面的地质情况很特殊，几十公分的地下，便是终年不化的永冻层，铁路怎样通过这里，是修建铁路的一个难题。为了给今后设计工作提供准确的资料，他们在这里进行了开挖，查看永冻层的各种情况。在这个永久冻结的地方，将来机车用水是个很大的问题。大唐古拉山，一上一下就是四十多公里，而且坡度高达千分之二十（一般只有千分之十二），火车通过需要双机牵引。特别是由于海拔过高、空气稀薄，机车需要的水更多。为了找水，他们特地踏勘了由雪山冰川溶化的水汇集而成的唐古拉山海。这个内陆湖，四周被泥沼包围着，走到湖边很不容易。踏勘人员拄着花杆，踩着泥沼上一丛一丛的苔藓，费了许多劲，才迂回到湖边。湖的东西足有十华里长，南北足有两三华里宽，周围雪山上的雪水，还在日日夜夜地流进去。这是一个理想的给水站，将来爬越大唐古拉山的机车，再不用愁没水用了。
    向导登卓茨仁
    踏勘人员经过羊八井石峡到达拉萨后，又辗转在拉萨东北的傍沱河一带，沿着唐古拉山系的崇山峻岭之间，勘测黑竹公卡线路方案。这是西藏地区富庶的农业区域之一，也是人口比较稠密的地方。沿线农民听到勘测铁路的人来了，纷纷奔走相告。有的送牛奶、乳酪来给客人吃，有的腾出最好的房子叫客人住。
    登卓茨仁，是个二十三岁的藏族青年，也是踏勘人员的有力助手。旅途中，他既是一个娴熟的向导，又是一个勤恳的饲养员。不论山再高，水再急，只要向他说明要去的方向，他总是打先锋，巧妙地找出通过的路径。傍晚快要收工之前，需要寻找住宿的地方，他又扬鞭纵马，很快消失在绿色的田野里。等到踏勘人员一到计划休息的地方，他早把房子、锅、水、木柴，全准备好了。夜间，他三番五次地起来给牲口添草。第二天天不明，他又已备好鞍，开始新的旅程。正是由于他这样热情的工作，这个局部线路才得在九天内完成。
    现在，青藏铁路的踏勘工作已经完成。勘测人员根据所搜集的资料，参照着航空照片，已选定一条从噶尔穆到拉萨的全长一千二百公里的主要线路方案。汇集的资料表明：整个青藏铁路除了昆仑山、大唐古拉和羊八井石峡等重点工程外，全线大部分很平坦，修建工程并不大。（附图片）
