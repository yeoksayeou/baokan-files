Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: According to TASS, Moscow, December 4th: Party organizations in various Soviet republics and regions continue to hold meetings of activists to discuss the results of the recent representatives' meeting of fraternal parties in Moscow. The members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union who participated in these meetings unanimously support the historic documents adopted at the Moscow meeting.

    Kusinen, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU and Secretary of the Central Secretariat, said at the meeting of activists of the Estonian Republic's party organization that the representatives' meeting of communist and workers' parties marked a new and important stage in the development of the world communist movement and the struggle of the people of all countries for world peace.

    Mazurov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belarus, pointed out in his speech at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belarus that the Peace Manifesto plays a significant role in uniting peace-loving people and mobilizing them to fight against the threat of a new war. He said that the two declarations adopted at the Moscow meeting armed communists around the world with clear goals. These two documents gave all fighters for peace and socialism greater confidence in their strength and victory.

    Suslov, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU and Secretary of the Central Secretariat, spoke at the meeting of activists of the Rostov Oblast party organization. He said that the representatives' meeting of communist and workers' parties from more than sixty countries was the most representative meeting in the history of the entire world communist movement. He said that the Peace Manifesto and the Declaration of the Representatives' Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries are the long-term combat programs for the world communist movement in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 5th: According to the "People's Daily" of Vietnam, the Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Party held a special meeting on the 4th. The resolution unanimously adopted at the meeting pointed out that the Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Party fully agreed with the views in the two declarations of the Moscow meeting.

    The meeting adopted a plan to widely disseminate and study the two declarations. The resolution adopted at the meeting called on the entire party to study these two documents.

    Before passing the relevant resolutions, the special meeting heard a report on the Moscow meeting by Le Duan, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, who was a member of the Vietnamese Party and government delegation that went to Moscow to participate in the 40th anniversary celebration of the October Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 5th: The Czechoslovak News Agency reported: "Red Rights" published today the resolution of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia on the meeting of communist and workers' parties held in Moscow.

    The resolution pointed out that the Czechoslovak people fully agree with the results of the talks and support the Declaration of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and the Peace Manifesto. The reaction caused by these documents in Czechoslovakia shows that communists and other working people welcome the Moscow meeting with joy, unanimously agree with the declaration and the Peace Manifesto, and support the views of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and its Central Committee. One of the most important tasks is to further expand and strengthen the comprehensive cooperation and unity between socialist countries, and to further strengthen the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The resolution said that we believe that the unity of the international working class movement is the most important thing. The international communist movement, especially the socialist camp, gives us invaluable help. Without the support and cooperation of communists in all countries of the world, we would not be able to achieve what we have already achieved on our own. The prestige and influence gained by the communist movement and revolutionary doctrine make it necessary for us to resolutely liquidate revisionism, the essence of which is to cover up the fundamental contradictions between the working class and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, and between the forces of peace and the forces of war. However, this does not mean that we do not see the manifestations and dangers of dogmatism. Our party has always fought against dogmatism mainly by creatively applying the principles of Marxism-Leninism and by constantly strengthening the party's ties with the masses.

    The realization of the conclusions in the Peace Manifesto will revitalize the peace movement and help to thwart the conspiracies of the bellicose imperialist groups. If the imperialists launch aggression, it will bring huge losses to mankind, but this does not mean the end of civilization and mankind, but rather the final collapse of imperialism. Nevertheless, communists still hope that the working people can avoid the sacrifices that another war will inevitably cause. Therefore, communists are warning against this possible danger and calling on all wise, honest, and peace-loving people to fight. The prospect of victory in this struggle is very real. Like communists all over the world, our party will make the greatest efforts to ensure that this struggle is victorious.

    The resolution finally called for organizing a widespread propaganda movement throughout the party, in all mass organizations, in enterprises and villages, so that all working people know the results of the meeting of communist and workers' parties in Moscow. The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia decided to hold a plenary session of the Central Committee after this propaganda movement to discuss the further tasks arising from the Moscow meeting of communist and workers' parties.

Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: According to TASS, Brussels, December 2nd: Burnel, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party, published an article in "Red Flag" commenting on the results of the Moscow meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties.

    Burnel wrote: Seeing the communist representatives from all over the world gathered together to hold a great meeting, he more deeply realized how powerful the international communist movement is. The courage, lofty goals, and achievements of this movement are unparalleled.

    Burnel pointed out that the meeting emphasized the need to strengthen ties between communists all over the world. He wrote: Those who expect divisions between communist parties in various countries are indulging in wishful thinking.

    广泛宣传和学习莫斯科宣言
    苏越捷等国党的组织大力开展活动
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科4日讯：苏联各加盟共和国和边疆区党组织继续举行积极分子会议，讨论各国兄弟党最近在莫斯科举行的代表会议的成果。参加这些会议的苏联共产党党员们都一致拥护莫斯科会议所通过的历史性文件。
    苏共中央主席团委员、中央书记处书记库西宁在爱沙尼亚共和国党组织积极分子会议上说，共产党和工人党代表会议标志着世界共产主义运动的发展和各国人民为世界和平而斗争的新的重要阶段。
    白俄罗斯共产党中央委员会第一书记马祖罗夫在白俄罗斯共产党中央全会发言时指出，和平宣言在团结爱好和平的人民方面以及在动员他们起来进行反对新战争威胁的斗争方面，都起着重大的作用。他说，莫斯科会议通过的两个宣言用明确的目标武装了全世界的共产党人。这两个文件使争取和平和社会主义的全体战士对他们的力量和胜利有了更大的信心。
    苏共中央主席团委员、中央书记处书记苏斯洛夫在罗斯托夫州党组织积极分子会议上讲了话。他说，六十多个国家的共产党和工人党代表会议是整个世界共产主义运动史上的一次最具有代表性的会议。他说，和平宣言和社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言是今后世界共产主义运动长时期的战斗纲领。
    新华社河内5日电　据越南“人民报”报道，越南劳动党中央委员会在4日举行了特别会议。会议一致通过的决议指出，越南劳动党中央委员会完全同意莫斯科会议两个宣言中的观点。
    会议通过广泛传达和学习这两个宣言的计划。会议通过的决议号召全党学习这两个文献。
    特别会议在通过有关的决议以前，听取了前往莫斯科参加十月革命四十周年庆祝典礼的越南党和政府代表团团员、劳动党中央政治局委员黎笋所作的关于莫斯科会议的情况的报告。
    据新华社布拉格5日电　捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道：“红色权利报”今天刊载了捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会政治局关于各国共产党和工人党在莫斯科举行的会议的决议。
    决议指出，捷克斯洛伐克人民完全赞同会谈的结果，并且拥护社会主义国家共产党和工人党的宣言以及和平宣言。这些文件在捷克斯洛伐克所引起的反应表明，共产党员和其他劳动人民以愉快的心情欢迎莫斯科的会议，一致赞同宣言和和平宣言，并且拥护捷克斯洛伐克共产党及其中央委员会的观点。最重要的任务之一是进一步扩大和加强社会主义国家间的全面合作和团结，进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营。决议说，我们认为国际工人阶级运动的团结是最重要的事情。国际共产主义运动、特别是社会主义阵营给予我们无可估量的帮助。没有全世界各国共产党人的支持和合作，单靠我们自己是不能取得我们已有的成就的。共产主义运动和革命学说所获得的威望和影响使我们必须坚决地清算修正主义，修正主义的本质是掩盖工人阶级和资产阶级之间、社会主义和资本主义之间、和平力量和战争力量之间的根本矛盾。但是，这并不等于说我们没有看到教条主义的表现和危险。我们党过去和现在都是主要靠着创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的原则、靠着不断加强党同群众的联系来同教条主义作斗争的。
    实现和平宣言中的结论将使和平运动活跃起来，并且有助于挫败好战的帝国主义集团的阴谋。假如帝国主义者发动侵略，这将给人类带来巨大的损失，但这并不意味着文明和人类的末日，而是意味着帝国主义的最后崩溃。虽然如此，共产党人还是希望劳动人民避免另一次战争所必然会造成的牺牲。因此共产党人才针对这种可能发生的危险发出警告，并且号召一切明智、诚实和爱好和平的人们进行斗争，这种斗争的胜利的前途是十分现实的。像全世界共产党人一样，我们党要作最大的努力使这一斗争取得胜利。
    决议最后号召在全党范围内、在所有群众团体里、在企业和村庄里，组织一个广泛的宣传运动，让一切劳动人民知道共产党和工人党在莫斯科举行会议的结果。捷共中央政治局决定在这次宣传运动以后举行中央委员会全体会议，以讨论共产党和工人党莫斯科会议所产生的进一步的任务。
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社布鲁塞尔2日讯：比利时共产党中央委员会书记伯内尔在“红旗报”上发表文章，评论共产党和工人党代表莫斯科会议的结果。
    伯内尔写道：他看到来自世界各地的共产党代表济济一堂，举行伟大的会议，更加深刻地体会到国际共产主义运动是多么强大。这个运动的勇敢精神、崇高目标和所取得的成就是无可比拟的。
    伯内尔指出，会议强调指出必须加强全世界共产党人之间的联系。他写道：那些指望各国共产党之间发生分歧的人是在痴心妄想。
