Hunan Requires the Elimination of Malaria within Seven Years
	This Year, Malaria Patients Have Already Decreased by More Than 40%

	(Our Newspaper News) Hunan Province has achieved great success in malaria prevention and treatment this year. From January to October, the number of malaria cases in the province decreased by 43.24% compared to the same period in 1956.

	After Hunan Province officially announced the seven-year plan to eliminate malaria this year, proposing the tasks of expanding prevention and treatment, rapidly reducing the incidence rate, and controlling outbreaks, Party and government leaders at all levels strengthened the organization and leadership of malaria prevention and treatment work. Counties established malaria control offices and malaria prevention leading groups, and some townships and agricultural cooperatives also established malaria prevention committees to specifically lead malaria prevention work. Most areas also strengthened and adjusted the technical force and material allocation of county health and epidemic prevention stations, and strengthened the business leadership of county health and epidemic prevention stations in malaria prevention work. Leaders at all levels also held professional meetings to make specific arrangements for malaria prevention work and trained professional cadres. Most areas also organized and trained a large social medical force, mobilizing joint clinic doctors and agricultural cooperative health workers to participate in the fight against malaria. Starting this spring, Hunan Province has universally carried out anti-malaria recurrence treatment, systemic treatment, and prophylactic medication, largely eliminating sources of infection, reducing recurrence rates, and controlling epidemics. Some areas have also given full play to the role of traditional Chinese medicine. The widespread use of traditional Chinese medicine and effective folk prevention and treatment methods has played a certain role in reducing the incidence of malaria. Due to the adoption of the above measures, the number of malaria cases in forty counties in Hunan Province this year has decreased by more than 50% compared to last year, of which fifteen counties have decreased by 60% to 69%, and six counties have decreased by more than 70%.

	Recently, Hunan Province also held a malaria prevention and treatment meeting, summarized the work experience of malaria prevention and treatment this year, and proposed the requirement to reduce the number of malaria cases in the province by 50% in 1958.

	In order to overcome malaria and ensure a bumper agricultural harvest, the meeting also proposed to further strengthen the leadership of malaria prevention and treatment; continue to strengthen the technical force and technical equipment, and ensure the timely supply of anti-malaria drugs; give full play to the social medical force, and establish malaria prevention organizations from the county to the township to the cooperative.

    湖南要求在七年内消灭疟疾
    今年疟疾病人已经减少40％以上
    本报讯  湖南省今年防治疟疾工作，获得了很大的成绩。全省1至10月份的疟疾发病人数，比1956年同时期降低了43.24％。
    湖南省在今年正式公布的七年消灭疟疾的规划中，提出了今年展开防治、迅速降低发病率和控制暴发流行的任务以后，各级党政领导加强了对防治疟疾工作的组织领导。各县成立了抗疟办公室和防疟领导小组，部分县里的乡、社也成立了疟疾防治委员会，具体领导防疟工作。大部分地区还充实和调整了县卫生防疫站的技术力量和物资配备，加强了县卫生防疫站对防疟工作的业务领导。各级领导还召开了专业会议，对防疟工作作了具体安排，训练了专业干部。大部分地区还组织和训练了广大的社会医疗力量，发动了联合诊所医师和农业社的卫生员参加了防疟斗争。从今年春季开始，湖南全省普遍地展开了抗疟疾复发治疗、系统治疗和预防性服药等工作，大量地消灭了传染源，减少了复发率，控制了流行。有些地区还充分发挥了中医、中药的作用。广泛地运用了中药和民间有效的防治方法，对降低疟疾发病率起了一定的作用。由于采取了上述各项措施，今年湖南省四十个县的疟疾发病人数比去年下降了50％以上，其中有十五个县下降了60％至69％，有六个县下降了70％以上。
    最近，湖南省又召开了疟疾防治会议，总结了今年防治疟疾的工作经验，并提出了1958年要把全省疟疾发病人数下降50％的要求。
    为了战胜疟疾，保证农业大丰收，这次会议还提出了要进一步加强防治疟疾的领导；继续充实技术力量和技术设备，保证抗疟药品的及时供应；充分发挥社会医疗力量，建立从县到乡到社的防疟组织等要求。
