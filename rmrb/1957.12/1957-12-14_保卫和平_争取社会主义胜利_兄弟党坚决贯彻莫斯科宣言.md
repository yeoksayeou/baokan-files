Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 12th: The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic held a meeting on the 11th to listen to and discuss Prime Minister Grotewohl's government statement on the peace declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries. The People's Chamber then unanimously adopted the joint resolution of the People's Chamber's parliamentary groups and the People's Chamber's letter to the Bonn Federal Assembly.

Grotewohl said in the government statement: The peace declaration points out the path to preventing war and maintaining peace. He called on all German people to express their support for this declaration with their practical actions. He pointed out: The strength of the peace-loving socialist camp has surpassed that of the bellicose imperialist camp.

Grotewohl pointed out: Countless cracks have appeared in the imperialist camp, and this is not accidental. The crisis within the North Atlantic Group is the result of the intensification and sharpening of internal contradictions among imperialist countries after the appearance of many signs of a new economic crisis. The West German ruling clique's attempt to seize hegemony in Western Europe has further intensified the contradictions within the West.

Grotewohl then reiterated the German Democratic Republic's firm opposition to resolving political disputes by force. He suggested that the governments of East and West Germany conclude an all-German agreement on the following issues:

*   Not to set up and store atomic bombs and rocket weapons on German territory;
*   Not to manufacture or purchase and obtain atomic bombs and rocket weapons from other countries;
*   Not to equip the army with atomic weapons and rockets, regardless of the source of these weapons;
*   To eliminate weapons of mass destruction in West Germany through negotiations between West Germany and countries with troops stationed in West Germany.

The joint resolution of the People's Chamber's parliamentary groups pointed out: The German Democratic Republic will continue to tirelessly promote peace, develop peaceful cooperation between countries and peoples, and realize the principle of peaceful coexistence. In order to maintain peace in Europe and enable the peaceful development of the whole of Germany, the People's Chamber advocates the establishment of a region in Central Europe that does not store atomic weapons and the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in Germany and other European countries.

The People's Chamber declared its support for the two declarations of the Conference of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties.

In the letter to the Bonn Federal Assembly, the People's Chamber issued a solemn warning about the devastating consequences of West Germany becoming an atomic base for the North Atlantic Group and equipping the West German army with atomic weapons. In view of the upcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Group Council in Paris, which will turn the North Atlantic Group into a broad atomic alliance and turn West Germany into an atomic springboard, the People's Chamber calls on the West German Federal Assembly to urge the West German government to reach an agreement with the government of the German Democratic Republic on the points suggested in Prime Minister Grotewohl's government statement.

Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: Paris Dispatch: French Communist Party General Secretary Maurice Thorez delivered a speech at the Central Committee meeting held in Ivry on December 5, expounding on the profound significance of the declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries and the peace declaration. Thorez said that the declaration of the twelve Communist and Workers' Parties is the most powerful proof of the international solidarity of the entire workers' movement and the communist movement.

Thorez pointed out that we are at the beginning of a new leap forward in the international workers' movement. Socialism is advancing all over the world, while imperialism is retreating everywhere. The capitalist world is struggling in increasingly serious contradictions, which not only pit the bourgeoisie against the working class, but also the monopoly class against all other nationals.

Thorez said that this declaration actually stipulates a program of action for Marxist-Leninist parties. The declaration provides a universally significant summary of the experience accumulated by the fraternal parties in power in socialist countries. The declaration points out the path for Communist Parties in all countries, which is to broadly unite the forces of the people, lead them in the struggle against the few representatives of the trust capitalists, and against the policy of national betrayal that succumbs to American imperialism.

Thorez then analyzed the political situation in France. He said that the current situation in France fully confirms the analysis in the declaration. He pointed out that there are two decisive factors in the French political situation, namely, the recent major strikes in France and the development of the struggle against the Algerian war. The united action of Communist and Socialist workers in economic struggles and in the political sphere is being realized. The provincial committees of the Radical Party and Catholic organizations are also participating in joint actions.

Thorez said that opposition to the Atlantic Pact policy has become a universal sentiment in France, and even those who previously defended this policy are now opposing it. The US attempt to establish atomic bases in France is arousing nationwide indignation in France. He said that, as the Moscow Conference emphasized when adopting the peace declaration, the struggle to safeguard the great cause of peace is the main task at present. Thorez said that in France, the proposition of organizing a people's front and establishing a left-wing government is rapidly gaining popularity. This is no longer a fantasy but a practical proposition. He said that we have all the necessary conditions to move forward and pave the way for a left-wing government.

Thorez concluded by saying that we look to the future with confidence. We will definitely be able to change French policy, definitely be able to organize a left-wing government, to create peace in Algeria, ease international tensions, ensure that freedom is respected, and that the demands of the people are met. We will accelerate the victory of socialism in our country.

Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: According to TASS, Rome: The plenary session of the Central Committee and the Central Supervisory Committee of the Italian Communist Party was held from December 9th to 11th. The meeting unanimously adopted the report by the party's General Secretary Togliatti on the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the results of the conference of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties held in Moscow. During the discussion of this report, the speakers unanimously pointed out the necessity of ideological and practical struggle against revisionism, and pointed out that the declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries is a reaffirmation of the unity of the communist movement, a proof of its strength and its ability to develop further. The meeting endorsed the two declarations adopted in Moscow and the line followed by the delegation of the Italian Communist Party at the conference of Communist and Workers' Parties.

Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti emphasized in his report to the meeting that at present, "there are twelve countries in Europe and Asia carrying out socialist construction together with the Soviet Union, including the great People's Republic of China." "In this way, we see the progress of socialist countries, which fundamentally changed the structure of the entire world, depriving capitalism of the advantages it once possessed, which promoted, to some extent determined, and generally made it possible for a large part of mankind to get rid of colonial enslavement, changed the international situation, and at the same time had an increasingly profound impact on the development of various countries, because this progress opens up a path for the working class and all democratic and progressive forces to new victories."

Togliati said that the declaration of the Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries and the peace declaration unanimously adopted by the representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, these two declarations prove that the communist movement is united in defending peace and striving for socialism.

He said: The current international situation is very serious, and at the same time there are broad possibilities for achieving success in the persistent struggle against launching a third world war and striving to maintain lasting peace. The imperialist world has suffered a series of serious shocks, which has aggravated the crisis of its military and political systems.

Togliatti said that the socialist world, headed by the Soviet Union and the Communist Parties of the world, is such a huge, united, and confident force; this force feels that, with the support of the vast majority of mankind, it has the ability to complete the great task that is decisive for the destiny of mankind. The celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution and the political measures taken at that time made us even more convinced of this.

Togliatti used many examples to illustrate the brilliant achievements made by the Soviet Union in the forty years of Soviet power. He emphasized that the fact that socialism is superior to capitalism has been confirmed by the real life of Soviet society.

Togliatti pointed out that the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries are vigorously carrying out economic construction, and they need peace. Peace is their main goal.

Togliatti emphasized "the danger of revisionist views infiltrating the ranks of the working class," he pointed out, "We must unremittingly and unshakably fight against this view, while not forgetting the danger of dogmatism and sectarianism."

Togliatti then spoke about the peace declaration signed in Moscow, he said: "The peace declaration is of special significance to our party and all the Italian people, when the Italian rulers are once again acting as arrogant lackeys of American imperialism. Our motherland is in danger of becoming a major base for American military and political aggression in Europe, and therefore is in danger of becoming a major warehouse for weapons of mass destruction. We should launch, awaken, and organize a powerful and effective people's movement to resist this policy."

Togliatti said: The declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries has further strengthened the entire communist movement, greatly promoted the unity of our movement, and it puts forward the basis of the general program in theoretical and practical aspects to parties of all countries. Therefore, we agree with this declaration issued after the Moscow Conference, and we will firmly and unconditionally support it.

　　保卫和平  争取社会主义胜利
    兄弟党坚决贯彻莫斯科宣言
　　德意志民主共和国政府声明
　　号召全体德国人民支持和平宣言
    据新华社柏林12日电　德意志民主共和国人民议院11日举行会议，听取和讨论了格罗提渥总理关于各国共产党和工人党和平宣言的政府声明。人民议院然后一致通过了人民议院各党团联合决议和人民议院告波恩联邦议院书。
    格罗提渥在政府声明中说：和平宣言指出了阻止战争和维护和平的道路。他号召全体德国人民以自己的实际行动来表示对这个宣言的支持。他指出：爱好和平的社会主义阵营的力量已经超过了好战的帝国主义阵营。
    格罗提渥指出：帝国主义阵营已经出现了无数的裂痕，这不是偶然的。北大西洋集团内部的危机是由于帝国主义国家在新的经济危机的许多征象出现后内部矛盾更加剧烈和尖锐的结果。西德统治集团争夺西欧霸权的企图使西方内部的矛盾更加尖锐化。
    格罗提渥接着重申德意志民主共和国坚决反对用武力解决政治争端。他建议：东西德政府就下列问题订立全德协定：
    不允许在德国领土上设置和储存原子弹和火箭武器；
    不制造和不从其他国家购买和取得原子弹和火箭武器；
    不用原子武器和火箭来装备军队，不论这些武器的来源如何；
    通过西德和在西德驻有军队的国家之间的谈判，消除在西德境内的大规模毁灭性武器。
    人民议院各党团联合决议中指出：民主德国今后仍将不倦地促进和平、发展各国和各国人民之间的和平合作、实现和平共处原则。为了维护欧洲和平和使整个德国得到和平发展，人民议院主张在欧洲中部建立不储存原子武器的地区，撤退驻在德国和其他欧洲国家中的一切外国军队。
    人民议院声明拥护共产党和工人党代表会议的两个宣言。
    在告波恩联邦议院书中，人民议院就西德变成北大西洋集团原子基地和用原子武器装备西德军队的毁灭性后果提出严正的警告。鉴于即将在巴黎举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议要使北大西洋集团变成广泛的原子联盟并且使西德变成原子跳板，人民议院呼吁西德联邦议院督促西德政府同德意志民主共和国政府就格罗提渥总理政府声明中所建议的各点达成协议。
　　多列士在法共中央全会演说
    宣言向各国共产党指明了道路
    据新华社12日讯　巴黎消息：法国共产党总书记多列士12月5日在伊符里举行的中央委员会会议上发表演说，阐述了社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言和和平宣言的深刻意义。多列士说，十二国共产党和工人党宣言是整个工人运动和共产主义运动国际团结的最有力的证明。
    多列士指出，我们正处于国际工人运动新的飞跃进展的开端。社会主义在全世界前进，而帝国主义却在到处后退。资本主义世界正在越来越严重的矛盾中挣扎，这些矛盾不仅使资产阶级同工人阶级对抗，而且使垄断阶层同一切其他国民对抗。
    多列士说，这个宣言为马克思列宁主义的政党实际上规定了一个行动纲领，这个宣言对社会主义国家中执政的兄弟党所积累的经验作出了具有普遍意义的总结。宣言向各国共产党指明了道路，这就是共产党广泛地团结人民群众的力量，领导他们进行反对托辣斯资本家的少数代表、反对屈从于美帝国主义的背叛民族的政策的斗争。
    多列士接着分析了法国的政治形势，他说，法国目前的局势完全证实了宣言中的分析。他指出法国政治形势中有两个决定性的因素，这就是法国最近发生的大罢工和反对阿尔及利亚战争的斗争有了发展。在经济斗争中和在政治方面共产党和社会党工人的行动一致正在实现，激进党省的党委会和天主教组织也参加了共同行动。
    多列士说，反对大西洋公约政策，在法国已经成了普遍的情绪，甚至那些前此还维护这种政策的人也在反对它。美国企图在法国建立原子基地的问题正在使法国全国群情激愤。他说，正像莫斯科会议在通过和平宣言时所强调指出的，维护伟大和平事业的斗争是当前的主要任务。多列士说，在法国，组织人民阵线和建立左翼政府的主张正在迅速地深入人心，这已不再是幻想而是一种切实可行的主张。他说，我们拥有向前进展、为左派政府开辟道路的一切必要条件。
    多列士最后说，我们满怀信心地瞻望将来。我们一定能改变法国政策，一定能组织一个左派政府，来缔造阿尔及利亚和平，缓和国际紧张局势，使自由获得尊重，使人民群众的要求得到满足。我们将加速社会主义在我国的胜利。
　　陶里亚蒂在意共中央全会上报告
    两大宣言证明共产主义运动团结一致
    据新华社13日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党中央委员会和中央监察委员会全体会议在12月9日到11日举行。会议一致通过了党总书记陶里亚蒂所作的关于伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年庆祝情况以及在莫斯科举行的共产党和工人党代表会议结果的报告。在讨论这个报告中，发言的人一致指出在思想和实践方面对修正主义进行斗争的必要性，并且指出社会主义国家共产党和工人党宣言是共产主义运动团结的重申，是它的力量和它有能力进一步发展的证明。会议拥护在莫斯科通过的两大宣言和意大利共产党代表团在共产党和工人党会议上所遵循的路线。
    意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂在会上所作的报告中着重指出，目前，“同苏联一起进行社会主义建设的有十二个欧亚国家，其中包括伟大的中华人民共和国”。“这样，我们看到了社会主义国家的进展，这个进展根本地改变了整个世界的结构，剥夺了资本主义过去拥有的优势，这个进展促进了、在某种程度上决定了、并且总的来说提供了可能，使很大部分人类摆脱殖民主义的奴役，改变了国际局势，同时对各国的发展产生日益深刻的影响，因为这个进展为工人阶级及所有民主和进步力量开辟出一条走向新的胜利的道路。”
    陶里亚蒂说，社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言和各国共产党和工人党代表一致通过的和平宣言，这两项宣言证明，共产主义运动在保卫和平、争取社会主义的斗争中是团结一致的。
    他说：目前的国际局势十分严重，同时又存在着广泛的可能，可以在反对发动第三次世界大战和争取维护长期和平的坚持斗争中取得成就。帝国主义世界遭受了一系列严重的震动，这加剧了它的军事体系和政治体系的危机。
    陶里亚蒂说，以苏联和全世界各共产党为首的社会主义世界是一种如此巨大的、如此团结和满怀信心的力量；这个力量感到，在绝大多数人类的支持下，它有能力完成对人类命运具有决定性意义的伟大任务。十月革命四十周年庆祝典礼和当时采取的政治措施使我们更加相信这一点。
    陶里亚蒂用许多例子说明了苏联在苏维埃政权四十年间所取得的辉煌成就。他强调指出，社会主义比资本主义优越这个事实已经被苏维埃社会的现实生活所证实。
    陶里亚蒂指出，苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家正在大力进行经济建设，它们需要和平。和平是它们的主要目标。
    陶里亚蒂强调指出了“修正主义观点渗入工人阶级队伍的危险性”，他指出，“必须毫不放松、毫不动摇地同这种观点进行斗争，同时不要忘记教条主义和宗派主义的危险性。”
    陶里亚蒂接着谈到在莫斯科签署的和平宣言，他说：“当意大利统治者再次充当傲慢的美国帝国主义的奴才的时候，对我们党和全体意大利人民来说，和平宣言具有特殊意义。我们的祖国有危险变成美国在欧洲的一个军事和政治侵略的主要基地，也就有危险成为存放大规模毁灭性武器的主要仓库。我们应该发动、唤起和组织一个声势浩大的和有效的抵制这种政策的人民运动。”
    陶里亚蒂说：社会主义国家共产党和工人党宣言进一步加强了整个共产主义运动，大大促进了我们运动的团结，它向各国党提出了理论和实践方面的总纲领的基础。因而，我们同意在莫斯科会议结束后发表的这个宣言，我们将坚决地、无条件地支持它。
