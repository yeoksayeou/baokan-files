Xinhua News Agency, Mengzi, December 25th: The restoration project of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway from Bisezhai in Yunnan, China, to Lao Cai in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been completed. A track-laying ceremony was held at the Luogu Railway Station on the 25th. After the railway soldiers laid the last rail and hammered in the last spike, the people of all ethnic groups present cheered enthusiastically. Girls of all ethnic groups in bright national costumes rushed to the railway soldiers laying the tracks to offer flowers and pay their respects. Subsequently, a colorful train, sounding its whistle, traveled from Kunming to Lao Cai on the Sino-Vietnamese border.

Zhang Chong, Vice Governor of Yunnan Province, who participated in today's track-laying ceremony, said that the opening of this railway will not only bring the mountainous areas inhabited by ethnic minorities in the border areas of Yunnan closer to the motherland, but also restore a channel for foreign trade in southwestern China, which will also play a significant role in the economic development of Yunnan Province. At the same time, it will further strengthen and develop the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people. Le Tung Son, Consul of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Kunming, also spoke at the ceremony. He said: The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway used to be a tool for French colonists to exploit and plunder the people of Vietnam and Yunnan, but after China's liberation and Vietnam's independence, this railway has become the property of the people of both countries. The opening of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has a positive effect on both Vietnam and Yunnan, which are building socialism, and will help their economic and cultural exchanges. At the same time, the friendship between the Vietnamese people and the Yunnan people will be further developed, consolidated, and closer. Therefore, this is also a victory for the people of our two countries.

The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway within China, from Kunming to Lao Cai, is 465 kilometers long and is one of China's major international trunk lines. The restored section from Bisezhai to Lao Cai is 177 kilometers long. After this section of the railway is opened to traffic, the several million tons of general merchandise, fabrics, and large-scale machinery and equipment that Yunnan Province needs to transfer from other places every year can be smoothly transported from the Guangxi Nanmu Railway through the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The flue-cured tobacco, mineral products, and other products of Yunnan Province can also be transported to all parts of the country in large quantities. According to investigations, after the opening of traffic, Yunnan can save more than 150 million yuan in transportation costs next year alone. (Attached picture)

    中越人民的大喜事
    滇越铁路接轨
    新华社蒙自25日电　滇越铁路从我国云南碧色寨到越南民主共和国河口段的修复工程已经完成，25日在倮姑车站举行了接轨典礼。当铁道兵铺上最后一根钢轨、打上最后一根道钉以后，在场的各族人民热烈欢呼，穿着鲜艳民族服装的各族姑娘，涌向铺轨的铁道兵官兵献花致敬。随后，一列彩色的列车扬着笛声从昆明驶向中越边境的河口。
    参加今天接轨典礼的云南省副省长张冲说，这条铁路通车以后，不仅使云南边疆少数民族聚居的山区同祖国的联系更加密切，而且恢复了一条我国西南地区对外贸易的孔道，对云南省经济的发展也将起很大作用。同时将进一步密切和发展中越两国人民传统友谊。越南民主共和国驻昆明领事黎松山也在典礼仪式上讲了话。他说：滇越铁路以前是法国殖民者剥削、掠夺越南和云南人民的工具，但在中国获得解放和越南独立以后，这条铁路成了两国人民的财产。滇越铁路的通车，对于正在建设社会主义的越南和云南来说，都有其积极作用，并有助于其经济和文化的交流。同时，越南人民和云南人民的友谊将更加发展、巩固和亲密。因此，这也是我们两国人民的胜利。
    滇越铁路中国境内从昆明到河口，全长四百六十五公里，是我国主要国际干线之一。修复完成的碧色寨到河口段共长一百七十七公里。这段铁路通车以后，云南省每年需从外地调来的几百万吨百货布匹和大型机械设备等，可从广西南睦铁路经越南民主共和国顺利转运进来，云南省产的烤烟、矿产品等也可大量运往全国各地。据调查：通车后，明年一年云南就可节省运费一亿五千多万元。（附图片）
