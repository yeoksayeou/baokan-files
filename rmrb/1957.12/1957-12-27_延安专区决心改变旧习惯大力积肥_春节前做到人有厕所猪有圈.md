    Yan'an Special District Resolves to Change Old Habits and Vigorously Accumulate Fertilizer
    To Ensure Every Person Has a Toilet and Every Pig Has a Sty Before the Spring Festival

    (Our newspaper reports) The Yan'an Special District has resolved to change old habits and vigorously launch a fertilizer accumulation campaign. It requires that the fertilized area of ​​crops in the entire special district in 1958 be increased from 60% last year to 72%, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu will also be increased from six cartloads to ten cartloads. The task of accumulating 30 million cartloads of fertilizer must be completed within the four months of this winter and next spring.

    In order to ensure the completion of the above tasks, the special district has put forward many specific requirements and methods: mobilize the masses to ensure that every household has a toilet and every village has a public toilet before the Spring Festival; mobilize the masses to raise pigs and sheep in large numbers and build sheep and pig sties, and before the Spring Festival, ensure that all pigs have sties, and frequently add bedding and clean sheepfolds; require Wuqi, Zhidan and other counties to change the habit of burning sheep manure; organize urban manure to be sent to the countryside and strengthen the management of manure around towns; use weeds, fallen leaves, and crop stalks to compost manure; dredge waterlogged ponds and dig up silt to make compost; universally promote high-temperature composting and smoked fertilizer; ensure that every household has a manure shovel and everyone has a manure basket; in plateau areas and areas with plenty of water conservancy, vigorously promote the planting of purple acacia and sweet clover green manure crops, etc. Each district and township must help agricultural cooperatives formulate specific fertilizer accumulation plans; agricultural cooperatives must arrange fertilizer accumulation tasks to teams, and regularly check, submit, and evaluate them. In terms of fertilizer accumulation remuneration, it is necessary to implement the principle of mutual benefit. For breeders, the method of setting quality and quantity and rewarding excess should be implemented to encourage them to diligently add bedding and clean the pens frequently. For fertilizer accumulated by cooperative members' families, pricing should be based on quality, and cash purchases should be strived for as much as possible.

    The Yan'an area has a large number of livestock and abundant fertilizer resources. Sheep manure alone can accumulate 5.8 million cartloads a year. In recent years, although the Yan'an Special District has made certain achievements in fertilizer accumulation work, the current fertilizer application situation is far from meeting the needs of increasing production. According to a survey in Fu County, 30% to 40% of the county's cultivated land is not fertilized, and the rest, although fertilized, is very small in quantity. More than 30% of the crops in Yanchuan County are "sweet seeds" (i.e., not fertilized). The formation of this situation is mainly due to the serious right-leaning conservative thinking of leaders and cadres at all levels in carrying out fertilizer accumulation work. The requirement that people have toilets and pigs have sties was put forward a long time ago, but it has not been implemented until now. It is estimated that 70% to 80% of human urine and feces and pig manure in the entire special district are wasted. In order to quickly change this situation, the special district severely criticized right-leaning conservative thinking and old habits at the water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation conference held in mid-November, and discussed and determined some specific measures.

### 延安专区决心改变旧习惯大力积肥  春节前做到人有厕所猪有圈

    延安专区决心改变旧习惯大力积肥
    春节前做到人有厕所猪有圈
    本报讯　延安专区已下决心改变旧习惯，大力开展积肥运动，要求1958年全专区农作物的施肥面积，由去年的60％提高到72％，施肥量也将由每亩六驮增加到十驮，今冬和明春四个月内，一定完成三千万驮积肥任务。
    为了保证上述任务的完成，专区提出了许多具体要求和办法：动员群众在春节前做到户户有厕所和村村有公共厕所；发动群众大量养猪养羊，和修建羊、猪圈，赶春节前，做到凡猪都有圈，对羊圈勤起勤垫；要求吴旗、志丹等县改变烧羊粪的习惯；组织城粪下乡，加强对城镇周围粪便的管理；利用杂草、落叶、庄稼衣子沤粪；掏涝池，挖淤泥沤制堆肥；普遍推行高温沤肥和熏肥；做到家家有粪锨，人人有粪筐；在高原和水利多的地区，大力提倡种紫穗槐和草木樨绿肥作物等。各区、乡要帮农业社订出具体的积肥计划；农业社要把积肥任务安排到队，按期检查收交和评比。在积肥报酬上一定要贯彻互利原则，对饲养员要实行定质定量、超额奖励的办法，来鼓励他们勤垫圈和勤起圈。对社员家庭积肥要按质计价，尽量争取现金收买。
    延安地区畜牧多，肥源雄厚，仅羊粪一年可积五百八十万驮。几年来，延安专区在积肥工作上虽有了一定成绩，但目前施肥状况还远不能满足提高产量的需要。据鄜县调查，全县有30％至40％的耕地不施肥，其余虽施肥，但量很少。延川全县农作物有30％以上是“甜种”。这种情况的形成，主要是各级领导和干部在开展积肥工作上，存在着严重的右倾保守思想。像人有厕所、猪有圈的要求，在很早以前就提出来了，但直到现在没有搞起来。据估计全专区有70％到80％的人尿粪和猪粪白白流失。为了迅速改变这种情况，专区曾在11月中旬召开的水利、积肥会议上，狠狠地批判了右倾保守思想和因循守旧习惯，并讨论确定了一些具体办法。
