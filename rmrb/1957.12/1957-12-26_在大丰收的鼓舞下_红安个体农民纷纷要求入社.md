    Inspired by a Great Harvest
    Individual Peasants in Hong'an Actively Request to Join Cooperatives
    (Our Report) Hubei, Hong'an County--Individual peasants in Hong'an County are actively requesting to join cooperatives. This year, on the foundation of cooperativization, Hong'an County again achieved a large-scale bumper harvest. Grain production increased by 19.9% compared to 1956, with an average yield of 820 jin per mu. Peanut production increased by 36.9% compared to 1956, with an average yield of 625 jin per mu. All 732 agricultural cooperatives in the county increased production and achieved bumper harvests in all aspects, comprehensively overfulfilling the production plan. Because cooperativization has demonstrated unparalleled superiority, and cooperative members continuously help individual households, more than 300 out of 505 individual peasant households in the county have joined cooperatives. In addition, some cooperative members who withdrew this spring have returned.
    Zhong Zhichang, a well-to-do middle peasant from Dajin Township with seven people to feed and four laborers, was encouraged by the director of Chunlin No. 2 Cooperative last year to join the cooperative. He said, "I'll think about it when we reach socialism. There are still individual households in the Soviet Union!" This year, during a seventy-day drought in the autumn, the agricultural cooperative had already finished winter sowing, but he hadn't planted a single sheng. Now he admits that cooperatives are stronger than individual farming and sought out cadres to join the cooperative. All eight individual peasant households belonging to this cooperative have now applied to join. The Xin'an Cooperative in Chengguan District has thirteen individual peasant households, planning to plant 27.5 mu of barley, 14 mu of wheat, and 13 mu of rapeseed. Due to a lack of drought resistance tools and manpower, they were unable to sow at all. Members of the Xin'an Cooperative helped them draw water and completed the winter sowing of all the fields in three days. At that time, six households applied to join the cooperative, and the remaining seven also submitted applications, saying gratefully, "If it weren't for the cooperative, we wouldn't have been able to plant wheat this year, and we wouldn't have anything to eat next year."
    In addition, households that had withdrawn from cooperatives this spring, believing that cooperatives were not free and could not increase production, have also returned. For example, among the seventeen new cooperative members in Dajin Township, each one has a great enthusiasm for production. Hu Zhisong, a member of the Lianmeng Cooperative, has already earned 110 points in just nine days of joining the cooperative. They said, "There is no way out for individual farming. Only by joining the cooperative is there a future." (Chen Beijun, Li Lingying)

    在大丰收的鼓舞下
    红安个体农民纷纷要求入社
    本报讯　湖北红安县个体农民纷纷要求入社。今年，红安县在合作化的基础上又一次的获得了大面积丰收，粮食比1956年增产19.9％，平均亩产八百二十斤，花生比1956年增产36.9％，平均亩产六百二十五斤，全县七百三十二个农业社，社社增产样样丰收，全面地超额完成了生产规划。由于合作化显示了无比的优越性，社员又不断对个体户进行帮助，全县五百零五户个体农民已有三百多户入了社。另外今春一部分退社的社员又重新回来了。
    大金乡个体户富裕中农钟志长，七个人吃饭，四个劳动力，春林二社社主任去年动员他入社，他说“到社会主义再讲，苏联还有单干户呢？”今年秋旱七十多天，农业社冬播已搞完，他还一升未种。现在他承认合作社比单干强，找着干部要入社。这个社所属八户个体农民已全部申请入社了。城关区新安社所属有十三户个体农民，计划种大麦二十七亩半，小麦十四亩，油菜十三亩，因抗旱工具和人力不足，根本无法播种，新安社社员们帮助他们车水，在三天内将冬播田全部种完。当时就有六户申请入社，其余七户也提出了申请，并感激地说：“要不是合作社，我们麦子今年眼看就种不成，明年就吃不成了。”
    另外，今春认为合作社不自由，不能增产已经退社的户也回来了。如大金乡已入社十七户新社员中个个生产劲头都很大，联盟社社员胡志松入社九天已做了一百一十分。他们说：“再搞单干无路可走，只有入社才有前途”。（陈北君、李菱英）
