Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, December 18th. Overseas Chinese and their relatives in Fujian Province have donated more than four million yuan this year to establish hospitals, schools, and build bridges and water conservancy projects for public welfare in their hometowns.

According to incomplete statistics from relevant departments, in the past year, overseas Chinese and their relatives have donated funds to build and expand a total of thirteen middle schools, forty-one primary schools, and a large number of cultural tutoring class school buildings in overseas Chinese hometowns. Jinjiang County, a famous overseas Chinese hometown with more than 300 primary schools run by overseas Chinese, has again seen the construction and expansion of 25 primary schools and the construction of three new middle school buildings this year through donations from overseas Chinese. The County Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese has also added 40 classes of middle or elementary cultural school tutoring classes, enrolling a large number of children of overseas Chinese and farmers.

Hospitals built with donations from overseas Chinese and their relatives in overseas Chinese hometowns such as Longxi, Hui'an, Minhou, Fuqing, Nan'an, and Yongding are also under preparation and construction. In Anxi County, overseas Chinese and their relatives have also donated 400,000 yuan to establish a medical network in the mountainous area near Guanqiao Town. In addition, the majority of overseas Chinese and their relatives at home and abroad have also donated funds to build a large number of small water conservancy projects and engage in public welfare undertakings such as bridge repairs and road repairs in their hometowns. In Fuqing County alone, overseas Chinese and their relatives donated funds to build more than 1,600 reservoirs, embankments, and other small water conservancy projects in their hometowns this spring, benefiting more than 95,000 mu of farmland.

Overseas Chinese and their relatives in Fujian Province have always been enthusiastic about public welfare undertakings in their hometowns. After liberation, the People's Government has vigorously supported and assisted various public welfare undertakings undertaken by overseas Chinese in all aspects. In June of this year, the Fujian Provincial People's Committee also formulated measures to reward and give preferential treatment to overseas Chinese who engage in public welfare undertakings. All overseas Chinese and their relatives who donate funds to build public welfare undertakings have also been praised or rewarded by local governments and people.
