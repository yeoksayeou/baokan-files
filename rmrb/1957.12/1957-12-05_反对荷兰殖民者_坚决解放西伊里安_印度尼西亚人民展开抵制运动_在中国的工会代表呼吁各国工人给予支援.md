　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 4th: Indonesian workers partially took over the Dutch company, Internationale Crediet- en Handels-Vereeniging "Rotterdam" (Internatio), in Jakarta on the 3rd. This company is one of the five major Dutch trading companies that monopolize Indonesia's import and export trade.

　　The workers took control of the warehouse and garage keys during the takeover, but the company's manager refused to hand over the keys to the accounting room, so the takeover was not fully completed.

　　The workers' action to take over Internatio was taken in accordance with the resolution of the Indonesian Democratic Workers' League, a trade union organization influenced by the Indonesian Nationalist Party. On the same day, Indonesian workers took over the Dutch Royal Shipping Company.

　　In other cities in Indonesia, the masses of workers and staff also took boycott actions against the Dutch. Shops in Bandung refused to sell goods to the Dutch, and rickshaw and taxi workers in the city refused to carry Dutch passengers.

　　The Central Committee of the Action Committee for the Liberation of West Irian, the Army and Youth Cooperation Organization, and representatives of workers and peasants held a meeting on the evening of the 3rd to discuss the issue of actions to strive for the liberation of West Irian. Indonesian First Deputy Prime Minister Hardi and eight government ministers attended the meeting.

　　Hardi and Information Minister and Chairman of the Action Committee for the Liberation of West Irian, Sudibjo, emphasized in their speeches at the meeting that every action to strive for the liberation of West Irian must be based on government policies and social aspirations.

　　The Army and Youth Cooperation Organization and representatives of workers and peasants signed a resolution at the meeting, advocating that the enterprises that have been taken over by workers should be transferred to the government for handling.

　　Xinhua News Agency, December 4th: Two Indonesian trade union representatives who are in Beijing attending the Chinese Trade Union "Eighth National Congress" jointly issued a written statement tonight, "calling on workers of all countries to strengthen the struggle for the liberation of West Irian by condemning any measures taken by Dutch colonialists that endanger Indonesian national independence and world peace." These two Indonesian trade union representatives hope that workers of all countries "can take boycott actions against Dutch maritime and air transportation tools used to strengthen its economic and military power in Indonesia."

　　The statement, issued by Djono, Secretary-General of the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union Federation (SOBSI), and Harsin Tarif, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Trade Union of the Republic of Indonesia, said that Indonesian workers and people of all strata fully support the attitude taken by the Indonesian government to recover West Irian.

　　The statement pointed out that Indonesia's national struggle is not isolated. Indonesian workers and people have recognized who their friends are. Standing with Indonesian workers and people are the increasingly united world workers' movement, as well as the freedom- and peace-loving Asian-African countries and peoples, and socialist countries and peoples.

　  反对荷兰殖民者　坚决解放西伊里安
　　印度尼西亚人民展开抵制运动
　　在中国的工会代表呼吁各国工人给予支援
    据新华社雅加达4日电　印度尼西亚工人3日在雅加达部分接管了荷兰的五美利洋行。这家洋行是垄断印度尼西亚进出口贸易的荷兰五大洋行之一。
    工人在接管时掌握了仓库和汽车房的钥匙，但是洋行的经理拒绝交出账房的钥匙，因此接管工作没有全部完成。
    工人接管五美利洋行的行动是根据印度尼西亚国民党影响下的工会组织印度尼西亚民主工人同盟的决议而采取的。在同一天，印度尼西亚工人接管了荷兰皇家轮船公司。
    在印度尼西亚的其他城市中，职工群众也对荷兰人采取了抵制行动。万隆市的商店不卖货物给荷兰人，市内的三轮车和出租汽车工人也拒绝载运荷兰乘客。
    解放西伊里安行动委员会中央委员会、陆军和青年合作组织以及工人、农民的代表在3日晚间举行会议，讨论了争取解放西伊里安的行动的问题。印度尼西亚第一副总理哈迪和政府的八位部长参加了这次会议。
    哈迪和情报部长兼解放西伊里安行动委员会主席苏迪比约在会议上发言时着重指出，为争取解放西伊里安而斗争的每一个行动都必须以政府政策和社会愿望为基础。
    陆军和青年合作组织以及工人、农民的代表在会议上签署了一项决议，主张把已经由工人接管的企业移交给政府处理。
    据新华社4日讯　正在北京参加中国工会“八大”的两位印度尼西亚工会代表今晚联名发表一项书面声明，“呼吁一切国家的工人通过谴责荷兰殖民主义者危害印度尼西亚民族独立和世界和平的任何措施，来加强解放西伊里安的斗争。”这两位印度尼西亚工会代表希望各国工人“能够对荷兰用于加强它在印度尼西亚的经济和军事的海上和空中的航运交通工具采取抵制行动”。
    由全印度尼西亚工会中央职工会总书记约诺、印度尼西亚共和国中央职工会副总书记哈沁·达利夫发表的这项声明说，印度尼西亚工人和各阶层人民完全支持印度尼西亚政府为收复西伊里安所采取的态度。
    声明指出，印度尼西亚的民族斗争不是孤立的。印度尼西亚工人和人民已经认清谁是他们的朋友。同印度尼西亚工人和人民站在一起的是其团结日益加强的世界工人运动以及热爱自由与和平的亚非国家和人民和社会主义国家和人民。
