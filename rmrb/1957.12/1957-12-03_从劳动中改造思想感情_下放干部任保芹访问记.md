　　Transforming Ideology and Feelings Through Labor
　　——An Interview with Downward Transferred Cadre Ren Baoqin
　　By Our Correspondent Miao Yiqin
　　I met Ren Baoqin, a downward transferred cadre from the Beijing Public Security Bureau, at the home of Wang Youcai, a member of the Red October Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yuegezhuang Township, Fengtai District, on the outskirts of Beijing. That day, he had just returned from a three-level cadre meeting convened by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing. He excitedly discussed with Wang’s mother when to start using furnace ash and sand to pad the pigsty. He held Wang Youcai's two children in his arms, and the children affectionately stroked Ren Baoqin's face, gently calling him "Grandpa." If I hadn't known Ren Baoqin beforehand, I would have mistaken Ren Baoqin and cooperative member Wang Youcai as a family.

　　I asked Ren Baoqin to talk about his labor experience and insights after being transferred downward. He humbly said, "You don't know until you labor, and once you labor, you deeply feel the greatness of labor. I must learn to labor and exercise. Without exercise, I am not qualified to be a servant of the working people."

　　He said: I arrived at the Red October Agricultural Production Cooperative on September 13th. When I first arrived, I was not only unaccustomed to labor, but also to my diet and daily life. On the second day at the cooperative, the alarm clock rang early in the morning, around five thirty. At that time, I thought: If I were still in the office, I would still be fast asleep! But then I thought: "No, I'm here to exercise?! Not to enjoy myself." I jumped out of bed in a hurry.

　　At first, when participating in labor, the team always assigned us some lighter farm work out of consideration. After working for a day, I felt very tired. At this time, I thought: If you plan to exercise, you have to be prepared to be tired. If you get tired and don't work, then don't plan to exercise. The more tired you are, the more you have to work. If you keep working, you won't be tired. Therefore, when I was most tired, I would pat my waist, stretch my arms, and my spirit would be revitalized.

　　Half a month later, the leadership assigned me to push a waterwheel, which is a relatively heavy farm work. After pushing for ten or twenty circles, I felt tired. I gritted my teeth and persevered. That day, I irrigated two and a half mu of land like the other cooperative members. After that, it was exactly the time for cabbage collection. The farm work at the Red October Agricultural Cooperative was extremely busy. Many cooperative members worked in the fields during the day and had to carry cabbage into the cellar at night. Like the cooperative members, I carried cabbage into the cellar after dinner, often until eleven o'clock at night. At this time, I deeply felt that my physical strength was much stronger and further realized that "tiredness" is only a necessary process for intellectuals participating in labor. Not only is there nothing to be afraid of, but it is also a very natural phenomenon.

　　In the past month, in addition to the farm work assigned by the team leader, I often took advantage of rest and meal times to learn some farm work from the cooperative members that I had not done or learned. Once, on the way home from the field for dinner, I saw the youth team members digging the ground, so I went to learn from them. Because the time was short, I didn't learn it that time. Later, I used my rest time to learn twice in our own team before I could say that I had initially learned it. Another time, also on the way home from the field for dinner, I came across cooperative members driving a cart to load flower stalks, so I followed them to learn how to drive a cart. At this time, the reporter smiled and said to him: "You really go everywhere, see everything, and learn everything." He said: "It's not that I'm eager to learn, but that there are too many things about the peasants that are worth learning for intellectuals. Just in terms of labor, an ordinary peasant can not only engage in agricultural production, but also build ordinary rural thatched houses! He pointed to the greenhouse (a greenhouse for growing leeks in winter) in front of Wang Youcai's residence and said: "That house was built by two cooperative members themselves. Don't look down on a farmer, they are really not simple! I have to learn all of these slowly."

　　At this time, the reporter asked him: "After participating in labor, what other experiences do you have?" He thought for a moment and said: "Another main experience is that participating in labor can change your own ideology and feelings. Although I can't say that my own ideology and feelings are consistent with those of the working people, the petty-bourgeois ideology and feelings of the original intellectuals always seem to have changed somewhat. When I first came, I also felt that manure was dirty, but after working with the peasants, I didn't dislike it at all. Once, I and the cooperative members put the diluted manure into the dragon ditch and then irrigated it from the dragon ditch to the field. One pool of manure irrigated more than ten mu of land. No manure could be left, and no land could be left empty. Although the stench was overwhelming, I didn't find it disgusting. On the contrary, I cherished it especially. I didn't want to leave even a little bit on the ground. Some downward transferred cadres said: Why not use more chemical fertilizers instead of manure to reduce the stench? I think that according to China's specific situation today, this idea is very impractical. Since manure is so needed in rural areas, I think: Some people's simple criticism of farmers for being dirty is really inappropriate. We should sympathize with farmers and help them gradually change this situation. For example, we should deeply carry out the anti-four pests movement and gradually change the manure disposal methods. If we can't change a lot all at once, some simple and easy-to-implement methods can still be changed immediately. For example, after defecating in the toilet, immediately sprinkle soil on it to reduce the stench, reduce flies, and increase fertilizer." He said that he plans to suggest that the team committee try this out in the production team he is assigned to. He also mentioned the issue of diligent pen padding that he and Wang's mother discussed just now, which is also this issue.

　　Speaking of this, he thought for a while and continued meaningfully: "After being transferred downward, as long as we truly eat, live, and work with the peasants, we can not only change our own ideology and feelings through labor, but also use some of the cultural knowledge we have learned to serve production. For example, when I was bundling cabbage and digging vegetable cellars with the peasants, various vegetables had various different bundling methods, and how exactly should vegetable cellars be dug? Where should the cellar vents be located? What direction? The peasants have a set of extremely rich experience. However, the peasants are limited by their cultural level and cannot summarize it well." Speaking of this, he took out the forty articles of the Agricultural Production Development Program that he carried with him and showed them to the reporter. He said: "The forty articles clearly instruct us: Each province, city, and autonomous region should collect local high-yield experiences, compile them into books, and disseminate and promote them. Therefore, I thought: Outsiders cannot solve this problem. We must become experts ourselves before we can solve it. So now I work with the peasants, carefully learn from their experience, and when I become an expert myself, I will summarize and promote their experience with the peasants. Now, in labor, I always pay attention to the peasants' experience and record it." At this time, he took out a small notebook that he carried with him. I opened it and saw densely packed charts of various kinds, some showing how to dig a vegetable cellar, some showing how to dig a dragon ditch. Each chart was annotated with explanations. As the reporter flipped through the pages one by one, he explained: "I haven't studied agriculture in the past, and I don't have enough knowledge to do this, so in addition to recording the peasants' production experience and my own experience at any time, I also have to take time to study agricultural production books in order to systematically improve this knowledge. This time, I went home and took a lot of books on agricultural agronomy."

　　从劳动中改造思想感情
　　——下放干部任保芹访问记
　　本报记者　缪宜勤
    在京郊丰台区岳各庄乡红十月农业生产合作社社员王有才家里，我会见了北京市公安局下放干部任保芹。这天，他正从北京城里开完中共北京市委召开的三级干部会议回来。他兴奋地和王老太太谈论着什么时候开始用炉灰和沙土在猪圈里垫圈的问题。他怀里抱着王有才的两个孩子，孩子亲热地抚摩着任保芹的面孔，轻轻地喊着“大爷”，如果我不是事先认识任保芹的话，我真会误以为任保芹和社员王有才就是一家人呢？
    我请任保芹谈谈他下放以后劳动的情形和体会，他谦逊地说：“不劳动不知道，一劳动就使我深深感到劳动的伟大，我一定要学会劳动，要锻炼，不锻炼，就没有资格做劳动人民的勤务员”。
    他说：我是9月13日到红十月农业生产合作社的，乍来时，别说劳动，连饮食起居都很不习惯。到社的第二天，早晨天蒙蒙亮，大约是五点半的样子，起床钟就当当地响了。当时我想：如果在机关里，这时还正蒙头大睡呢？但是转念一想：“不对，我是来锻炼的?！又不是来享福的”。一骨碌就从床上爬了起来。
    开始，在参加劳动的时候，队里为了照顾我们，总是分配给我们一些较轻的农活。劳动一天以后，感到非常疲累。这时，我就想：打算锻炼就得准备累，累了就不干，就别打算锻炼了，越是累，越是要干，干着干着就不累了。因此，我在干得最累的时候，就捶一捶腰，伸一伸胳膀，精神又重新振作起来了。
    半个月以后，领导上分配我推水车，这是比较繁重的农活，推了一、二十圈以后，就感到累了，我咬紧牙关，坚持干下去。这天，我和社员一样推水车，灌溉了二亩半田水。这以后，正好白菜收藏，红十月农业社的农活忙极了，许多社员白天下地，晚上还要抬白菜入窖。我和社员一样在晚饭后抬白菜入窖，经常抬到深夜十一点。这时，深深感到自己的体力强多了，更加认识到“累”只是知识分子参加劳动的必经过程，不仅没有什么可怕，而且是非常自然的现象。
    近一月来，除去队长分配的农活以外，我常常利用休息、吃饭的时间，跟社员学习一些我没有干过的或者没有学会的农活。有一次，从地里回家吃饭，看到青年队队员正在刨地，我就去跟他们学着刨，这次因为时间短，没有学会，后来我又利用休息时间，在我们自己队里学了二次，才算初步学会了。再有一次，也是从地里回家吃饭，碰上社员赶着大车去装花秸，我就跟他们学习赶大车。这时记者笑着对他说：“你真是走到哪里，看到哪里，学到哪里呀”。他说：“不是我好学，而是农民值得知识分子学习的地方太多了，仅就劳动这一项，一个普通农民，不仅仅能搞农业生产，还能建造普通的农村草房呢？他用手指着王有才住宅前面韭菜洞（冬天种韭菜的温室）的房子说：那房子就是两个社员自己造起来的，别看一个农民呀，真不简单哩！这一些，我都得慢慢学会。”
    这时，记者问他：参加劳动以后，还有些什么体会。他凝神想了一下，说：还有一个主要的体会是参加劳动可以转变自己的思想感情，现在虽然不能说自己的思想感情和劳动人民的思想感情是一致的，但是，原来知识分子小资产阶级的思想感情总觉得起了一些变化。我初来时，也曾觉得大粪脏，但是和农民一起劳动以后，我一点也不讨厌它。有一次，我和社员一齐把粪稀打到龙沟里，再从龙沟里灌到地里，一池子粪灌十多亩地，粪不能剩，地不能空。虽然臭味扑鼻，但是，我并没有觉得它讨厌，相反的，分外珍惜，那怕是一点点，都不愿意丢在地上。有些下放干部说：不用粪肥，多用些化学肥料，不就可以减少臭味了吗？我认为根据我们中国今天的具体情况，这种想法是很不实际的。粪肥对于农村既然如此需要，我就想：有些人单纯指责农民脏实在不应该，我们应该同情农民，帮助农民逐步改变这种状况。比如深入开展除四害运动，逐步改变粪肥处理办法，一下子如果不能改得很多，有些简单易行的还是可以立即改变，比如上厕所大便后，立即撒上土，可以减少臭味，减少苍蝇，又可以增加肥料。他说，这一点，准备建议队委会在他下放的生产组试行。他还说到刚才他和王老太太研究勤垫圈的问题，也就是这个问题。
    说到这里，他又想了一会儿，继续意味深长地说：下放以后，只要我们真正和农民一起同吃同住同劳动，就不仅可以使自己从劳动中改变自己的思想感情，而且可以把自己学到的一些文化知识，拿来为生产服务。比如，我在和农民一起捆白菜、挖菜窖时，各种菜蔬有各种不同捆法，菜窖究竟如何打？窖眼该打在什么地方？什么方向？农民都有一套极其丰富的经验。但是，农民限于文化水平，不能很好地总结。说到这里，他拿出他随身携带的农业生产发展纲要四十条给记者看，他说：四十条纲要中明白指示我们：由各省、市、自治区收集当地的丰产经验，编印成书，传播推广。因此，我就想：外行解决不了这个问题，必须让自己变成内行以后，才能解决，所以我现在和农民一起劳动，认真学习他们的经验，等自己变成内行以后，就和农民一起总结、推广他们的经验。现在，我在劳动中，随时注意农民经验，并把它记载下来。这时，他又拿出一本随身携带的小本本，我翻开一看，上面画着密密麻麻的各式各样的图表，有菜窖如何打的？有龙沟怎么挖的？每一个图表并注有说明。当记者一页一页翻阅的时候，他边解释边说：我自己过去没有学过农业，要弄这玩意儿，知识确实不够用，所以除随时记载农民生产经验和自己心得以外，还得抽空学习农业生产书籍，才能将这些知识系统地加以提高，这次回家去就拿了一大堆有关农业种植学方面的书籍呢？
