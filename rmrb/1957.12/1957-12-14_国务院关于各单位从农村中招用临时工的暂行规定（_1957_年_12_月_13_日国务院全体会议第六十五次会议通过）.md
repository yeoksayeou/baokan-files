　　1. Enterprises, institutions, government organs, military units, organizations, schools, and other units (hereinafter referred to as "various units") that require temporary workers should first resolve the need by transferring surplus personnel within their own units. If this is insufficient, they should, based on the state-approved labor plan, formulate quarterly plans for temporary worker needs and submit them to the People's Committee of the province, autonomous region, or directly administered municipality where they are located for approval. The local labor department should then resolve the need by transferring surplus personnel from other local units. If local transfers are still insufficient, the labor department may arrange recruitment. The recruitment of temporary workers must, as far as possible, be conducted in local cities; only when this is insufficient may recruitment be carried out in rural areas. If the local rural areas are unable to fulfill the recruitment task but it is suitable to recruit from neighboring provinces (regions) nearby, a report may be made to the Ministry of Labor, which will notify the relevant provincial (regional) People's Committee to instruct its labor departments to arrange recruitment.
　　In the event of urgent situations such as emergency repairs or disaster relief that require temporary workers, the units concerned are permitted to apply directly to the local People's Committee for prior recruitment and then complete the approval procedures retroactively.
    
　　2. When various units recruit temporary workers from rural areas, they must hold a letter of introduction from the local labor department and consult with the agricultural production cooperative under the guidance of the county and township People's Committees. Without the consent of the township People's Committee, individual farmers shall not be recruited.

　　3. When recruiting workers, various units must truthfully inform the township People's Committee, the agricultural cooperative, and the cooperative members working outside about the required qualifications for the temporary workers, the type of work they will be engaged in, the work location, the duration of the work, the living environment, and the wages and benefits, etc. The township People's Committee and the agricultural cooperative should actively fulfill the recruitment tasks.

　　4. When various units must recruit long-term workers from rural areas according to the labor plan, they should also follow the principles, procedures, and formalities stipulated in Items 1, 2, and 3 above.

　　5. When various units recruit temporary workers from agricultural cooperatives, they must sign a labor contract jointly with the agricultural cooperative and the cooperative members working outside. The labor contract should specify the temporary worker's job position, work duration, wages and benefits, the economic relationship between the cooperative members working outside and the agricultural cooperative as stipulated by the agricultural cooperative, and other rights and obligations of the three parties. The procedures for renewing or terminating the contract in advance should also be specified in the contract. After the contract is signed, all three parties must strictly abide by it. The contract form will be formulated and issued by the Ministry of Labor.

　　6. The economic relationship between the agricultural cooperative members working outside as temporary workers and the cooperative should be determined through democratic discussion within the cooperative based on the principle of mutual benefit for the cooperative and the cooperative members working outside, and in the spirit of promoting the labor enthusiasm of the cooperative members working outside.

　　7. All units are strictly prohibited from privately recruiting workers from rural areas and privately employing farmers who blindly flow into cities. Agricultural cooperatives and rural organizations and groups are also prohibited from privately introducing farmers to cities and industrial and mining areas to find work.

　　8. These regulations shall be supervised and implemented by the supervisory departments and labor departments at all levels.

　　9. These regulations shall come into effect from the date of promulgation. The People's Committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities should formulate implementation measures based on these regulations and implement them uniformly within their respective provinces, regions, and municipalities.

    二、各单位从农村中招用临时工，必须持有当地劳动部门的介绍信，在县、乡人民委员会的指导下，与农业生产合作社协商招用；非经乡人民委员会的同意，不得招用单干农民。
