    Catch Up, Surpass Her!
    Macheng County, Hubei Province—the county that will realize the agricultural program target of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu ten years ahead of schedule—has issued a friendly challenge to all fraternal counties in the province. This is a call to battle of great significance, and it will drive other counties to jointly realize a great leap forward in agriculture in this socialist great competition!
    Macheng's natural conditions are not very good, yet it can achieve a great leap forward. The fundamental reason lies in effective leadership, and in the consistent enthusiasm of the leadership and the people of the whole county; that is to say, Macheng's achievements are not a gift of nature, but the result of human effort. To learn from Macheng, we must learn their leadership methods, and more importantly, learn their enthusiasm! Can we achieve a leap forward? It depends on whether you have revolutionary spirit and that enthusiasm!
    The leaders of every locality should have such lofty ambitions: What they can do, we can also do! Respond to Macheng's challenge with a revolutionary fighting spirit! Catch up, surpass her!

    赶上去，超过她！
    提前十年实现农业纲要指标的百斤皮棉县——湖北麻城县，向全省各兄弟县发出了友谊挑战书。这是一个具有重大意义的战斗的号召，它将推动其他县份在这场社会主义大竞赛中共同实现农业大跃进！
    麻城自然条件并不很好而能大跃进，其根本原因在于领导得法，在于领导上和全县人民那股一致的干劲；也就是说麻城的成绩不是自然的赐予，而是人为的结果。学习麻城就要学习他们的领导方法，更重要的是学习他们那股干劲！能不能跃进？就看你有没有革命精神，有没有那股干劲！
    每一个地方的领导者，应当有这样的雄心壮志：他们能办到的，我们也能办到！用革命的战斗精神，响应麻城的挑战！赶上去，超过她！
