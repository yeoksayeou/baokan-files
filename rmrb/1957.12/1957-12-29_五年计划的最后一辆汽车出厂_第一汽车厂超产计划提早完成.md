Its license plate number is “○○八七七二,” making it the 4,772nd automobile produced in excess of the plan by the factory during the first Five-Year Plan.

    When the automobile rolled off the end of the assembly line, drums and gongs sounded in the workshop, and the workers happily carried celebratory reports written on large red paper to report the good news to the factory leaders.

    On this day, the workers arrived at the workshop very early. The conveyor belt on the main assembly line was constantly moving. The workers skillfully carried out the installation and quickly assembled the automobiles. New "Liberation" brand automobiles rolled off the assembly line one after another. After the assembly of automobile No. “○○八七七二,” Xie Shijun, the foreman of the adjustment section who had also driven the first automobile No. “○○○○○一” off the assembly line, drove it off the assembly line. This veteran worker with twenty years of experience jumped off the car and happily spoke to reporters about this automobile. He said, "Our automobiles have been continuously improved and are better than those produced at the beginning. They are suitable for both the South and the North."

    五年计划的最后一辆汽车出厂
    第一汽车厂超产计划提早完成
    据新华社长春28日电　第一汽车制造厂职工在27日下午装配好了五年计划期间生产的最后一辆汽车。它的牌号是“○○八七七二”，它是这个厂在第一个五年计划内超额生产的第四千七百七十二辆汽车。
    当这辆汽车从总装配线的末端开出来的时候，车间响起锣鼓声，工人们欢天喜地带着大红纸写的喜报，向工厂的领导人报捷。
    这一天，职工们很早就来到了车间。总装配线上的输送带终日转动不已。工人们熟练地进行安装，很快装成一辆汽车。新“解放牌”汽车一辆接一辆从总装配线上开出去。“○○八七七二”号汽车装配完成后，由曾经开出“○○○○○一”号汽车的调整工段工长谢士俊开出总装配线。这个有二十年工龄的老工长从车上跳下来，高兴地对记者谈起这辆汽车。他说：“我们的汽车经过不断改进，比最初生产的更好了，不论南方北方都很适用。”
