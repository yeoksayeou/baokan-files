    Such "Joy"
    On December 16th, at the meeting of heads of government of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, US President Eisenhower called on all partners of the group to strive for the "joy" of common sacrifice.
    However, what exactly is the so-called "joy" of this "common sacrifice" that the US President is vigorously calling for among the North Atlantic nations is indeed worth pondering.
    Listening to Dulles's speech at this meeting, we will have a clearer understanding of the essence of the "joy" of "common sacrifice" touted by Eisenhower. Dulles clamored for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to maintain a "retaliatory force that would destroy" the Soviet Union; he demanded that the member states of the group "deploy nuclear warheads under American supervision," and that these "nuclear warheads be handed over to the Supreme Allied Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for use by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces capable of using nuclear weapons"; he also advocated for the implementation of a coordinated plan for the production of new weapons in Europe, further strengthening the connections between the several aggressive groups controlled by the United States, and so on.
    That is to say, the United States is demanding that other member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization sacrifice more of their sovereignty and provide more financial resources, resources, and cannon fodder in order for the United States to make overall plans to step up the nuclear arms race. Where is the "common" "sacrifice" in this? Because the United States does not need to "sacrifice," only other member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization make "sacrifices" for the US military expansion and war preparations plan. Moreover, such sacrifices are not only not a "joy" for other countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but on the contrary, a misfortune; only the US ruling group sees this as a "joy."

### 如此“乐事”

    如此“乐事”
    美国总统艾森豪威尔16日在北大西洋集团政府首脑会议上，号召这个集团的全体伙伴为共同牺牲的“乐事”而奋斗。
    但是，美国总统竭力向北大西洋国家号召的这种所谓“共同牺牲”的“乐事”究竟是什么东西，确是值得玩味的。
    听听杜勒斯在这个会上的发言，我们会对于艾森豪威尔所标榜的“共同牺牲”的“乐事”的实质有更清楚的了解。杜勒斯叫嚷着要北大西洋集团维持一支会使苏联“毁灭的报复力量”；他要求这个集团的各成员国“在美国的监管下部署核弹头”，并且这些“核弹头将交给北大西洋公约组织盟军最高统帅供北大西洋公约组织能使用核武器的部队使用”；他还主张在欧洲实行一种生产新武器的统筹计划，进一步加强美国所控制的几个侵略集团之间的联系等等。
    这就是说，美国要求北大西洋集团其他成员国家更多地牺牲自己的主权，提供更多的财力、资源和炮灰，以便美国统筹策划，来加紧核军备竞赛。在这里那有什么“共同”的“牺牲”？因为美国是不需要“牺牲”的，只有北大西洋集团其他成员国家为美国的扩军备战计划作出“牺牲”。而且，这样的牺牲，对于北大西洋集团其他国家来说，不但不是什么“乐事”，相反的是一种祸事；只有美国统治集团把这看成是一种“乐事”。（毅之）
