　　"Sanitary Masks" and Mask Hygiene
　　Shi Guangjian
　　Masks sold in pharmacies usually come in a paper bag, often labeled "Sanitary Mask." Street vendors selling masks also shout, "Sanitary masks, who wants to buy!"

　　Wearing a mask during general cleaning or in windy weather can prevent the inhalation of dust. During epidemics of respiratory infectious diseases, wearing a mask can prevent infection. People with respiratory infectious diseases can prevent spreading germs to others and avoid further infection by wearing a mask, which can worsen their condition.

　　Whether for healthy individuals or patients, wearing a mask is for hygiene and disease prevention. However, if the "sanitary mask" is not sanitary—if the size and thickness of the mask are not up to standard, or if it is too dirty—wearing such a mask will not achieve the purpose of hygiene and disease prevention.

　　What kind of mask is considered up to standard? Generally, masks for adults should be made of six to eight layers of gauze, four inches wide and three inches long, and must be disinfected to be considered a "sanitary mask" that meets the standard.

　　Healthy people who wear substandard "sanitary masks" may confidently enter and exit public places during respiratory disease epidemics, even coming into contact with patients. Patients who wear substandard "sanitary masks" may carelessly come into contact with healthy people. This is extremely dangerous and can easily lead to the mutual transmission of diseases. For the health of the general public, it is hoped that mask manufacturers and sellers will produce genuine "sanitary masks" that meet the standards.

　　Even if the mask meets the standard, cleanliness must be maintained. Masks bought on the street should be disinfected first—boiled in boiling water for more than ten minutes, and then dried before use. It is necessary to prepare two masks and wash them frequently. If the mask gets wet or washed, do not place it on a stovepipe or radiator to dry; it is best to dry it in the sun or near a fire. Do not borrow masks from others to avoid mutual transmission of diseases. Do not use both sides of the mask, as the outer layer easily accumulates dust and germs. When not in use, wrap the mask in a clean handkerchief (or put it in a paper bag) and place it in your pocket, instead of hanging it around your neck or stuffing it casually into your pocket. Each time you wash the mask, it is best to boil it in boiling water for more than ten minutes to disinfect it.

　　“卫生口罩”和口罩卫生
　　史光简
    药房里卖的口罩，都有个纸袋，袋上常写着“卫生口罩”；卖口罩的小商贩叫卖时，也喊“卫生口罩，谁买！”
    在大扫除或大风天气外出时，戴口罩可以防止吸进灰尘；在呼吸道传染病流行时，戴口罩可以预防感染。有呼吸道传染病的人，戴口罩可以防止把病菌传给别人，并能使自己避免感染杂菌增加病情。
    无论是健康人或病人，戴口罩是为了讲卫生防疾病。但是，如果“卫生口罩”不卫生——口罩的大小、厚度不标准，或是太脏，那么，戴上这种口罩就达不到讲卫生防疾病的目的了。
    什么样的口罩才算合标准呢？一般大人用的口罩要由六—八层纱布制成，四寸宽、三寸长，并经过消毒的，才算是合标准的“卫生口罩”。
    健康人戴上不合标准的“卫生口罩”，在呼吸道疾病流行时，很放心地出入在公共场所，甚至任意接触病人；病人戴上不合标准的“卫生口罩”，随便接触健康人，这十分危险，很可能造成疾病的相互传染。为了广大人民的健康，希望制作口罩及卖口罩的单位，一定做合乎标准的、真正的“卫生口罩”。
    口罩合乎标准了，还必须注意清洁。在街上买来的口罩，最好先消毒——用开水煮十几分钟，晒干后再用。口罩需要准备两个，经常换洗。口罩湿了或洗了，不要贴放在炉筒上或暖气格子上烘，最好放在日光下晒或火旁烤干。口罩不要借别人的用，以免互相传染疾病。口罩不要两面用，因为外面的一层容易沾染灰尘和病菌。不用时，要用洁净的手帕把口罩包好（或用纸袋装好）放在衣袋里，不要挂在胸前或随便地往衣袋里一塞。每次洗口罩时，最好能放在开水中煮十几分钟，消消毒。
