　　Trade Union Representatives Discuss Socialist Competition Experience
    Confidently Greet the Second Five-Year Plan
    Minority Representatives Emphasize Strengthening the Unity of Workers of All Nationalities
    The Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions continued today. Eighteen representatives and observers from various regions presented reports on the work of trade unions in their respective regions and departments at the congress this morning and afternoon. They also expressed their opinions on issues related to welcoming the Second Five-Year Plan and further improving the work of trade unions in various aspects.
    Representatives from minority ethnic areas such as Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Guangxi emphasized in their speeches today the need to further strengthen the unity of workers of all nationalities. They believed that the unity of all ethnic workers is an important guarantee for building socialism.
    Wu Shounuo夫·Silamu (Uyghur), Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions, said that trade union organizations at all levels in Xinjiang attach great importance to ideological education on national unity, internationalism, and patriotism among the workers, in accordance with the principles and tasks determined by the Party at various times. As a result, phenomena such as ethnic discrimination and mutual disrespect left over from the era of reactionary rule have been eliminated among the workers. Although workers of all ethnic groups have different languages and customs in their daily work and life, thanks to the Party's correct and great ethnic policies, it has been able to unite all our ethnic people like a family, striving for the common aspiration of building socialism.
    Zhao Yunshi, Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in his speech that under the leadership of the Party, the unity of the working class in the autonomous region is consolidated, and it has united all ethnic groups in the region to contribute great strength to socialist construction. He said that the Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions has done a lot of work in cultivating ethnic workers and striving to expand the ranks of ethnic workers. Now the number of ethnic workers in the region has greatly increased compared with 1950, and more than 80% of the ethnic workers in many industrial and mining enterprises have become skilled workers. In order to cultivate the ranks of ethnic workers, the Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions once criticized some erroneous ideas such as "ethnic workers have low culture, low technology, and different languages and cannot be trained," so that trade union cadres realized that only by expanding the ranks of ethnic workers in the working class can we fundamentally strengthen national unity and jointly build Inner Mongolia.
    Chen Pinming (Zhuang), a grassroots committee member of the Mashan County Commercial Trade Union in Guangxi Province, said in her speech that she felt extremely excited as a Zhuang woman to be able to become a store employee and be selected to attend this conference. She said that recalling the suffering of our minority ethnic groups in the past makes me feel even warmer in the big family of nationalities under the leadership of the Party. She expressed to the conference: I must always remember the teachings of the Party, work hard, strengthen learning, and take practical actions to drive the Zhuang workers and strengthen the unity with the Han workers and workers of all nationalities to welcome our country's second five-year plan.
    The mass socialist competition launched by the broad masses of workers not only guaranteed the victorious completion of my country's first five-year plan, but also created a lot of experience in this competition, providing favorable conditions for continuing to carry out socialist competition to complete the second five-year plan. Many representatives talked about this issue today. Ren Zihe, Vice Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, used the actual situation in Gansu to illustrate the huge role of socialist competition in the construction of industry in the Gansu region. He said that because we firmly grasped the summary and promotion of advanced experience in the competition, paid attention to overcoming the conservative and arrogant ideas of some foreign workers and local workers, and conscientiously implemented the principle of "learning from each other, helping each other, learning from each other's strengths, and improving together," a spirit of mutual teaching and learning quickly formed among the broad masses of workers. For example, Shanghai workers teach local workers, Northeast workers teach Shandong workers, and local workers help foreign workers become familiar with the production process and local operating experience. In this way, the various advanced experiences brought by the workers who supported the construction of Gansu were systematically organized and disseminated, which effectively solved the contradiction that the technical level of the emerging industrial areas lagged behind the needs of rapid production development, and powerfully guaranteed the early completion of the national construction plan.
    Zhao Min, head of the Liaoning Provincial delegation, introduced the experience gained in Liaoning Province in carrying out socialist competition in the past few years in his speech. He believes that if we want to truly carry out socialist competition and develop it deeply and persistently, we must correctly understand the role of socialist competition; we must thoroughly implement the mass line throughout the organization of the competition; we must adhere to the unified leadership of the Party committee, with the administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League jointly responsible.
    The representatives were full of confidence in completing the tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan. He Yingcai, head of the preparatory committee of the National Agricultural and Water Conservancy Trade Union, said that during the second five-year plan period, my country's agricultural enterprises and water conservancy construction undertakings will shoulder very heavy tasks. State-owned agricultural enterprises have a relatively modern and advanced technical foundation, so they must take practical actions in the agricultural production increase movement and make a big leap forward in production. The workers in the water conservancy departments must strive to complete the water conservancy infrastructure construction tasks in the second five-year plan in order to gradually eradicate water disasters and comprehensively develop and utilize my country's abundant water resources. He emphasized that the most central task of trade union organizations at all levels of agriculture and water conservancy in the future is to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers and mobilize all positive factors to meet and promote a new upsurge in agricultural production. He said that all the workers in agriculture and water conservancy will surely be able to complete the great task of agricultural and water conservancy construction.
    Ying Zhongfa, a well-known model worker and technician from the Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory, and Li Shangzhong, a young worker from the Youth Friendship Furnace of the Anshan Iron and Steel First Smelting Plant, both expressed at the conference that they would further learn humbly, unite as one, and make greater achievements in the second five-year plan.
    An Lifu, Chairman of the National Committee of the China Highway Transportation Trade Union, delivered a speech on the mass line in trade union work. He said that if the trade union wants to do things for the masses, it should regard all work as its own business, and consult with the masses when doing things. When carrying out work, adopt a democratic method of persuasion and education. We must rely on the strength of the masses, do it together, and turn every task into a conscious and voluntary action of the masses. We must support new things among the masses and constantly replace the old with the new, so that we can promote the development of things and the progress of the movement. He also emphasized that trade union work should pay attention to concentrating the wisdom of the masses, summarizing the experience of the masses, and effectively promoting these experiences to the masses.
    Mao Yisheng, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, gave a speech at the conference this afternoon entitled "Further Develop Workers' Science and Technology Popularization Work to Greet a New Upsurge in Production." He said that science popularization is a characteristic of socialist countries and develops along with the development of socialist undertakings, and therefore its importance in serving socialism is becoming more and more significant. The Science Popularization Association was organized by learning from the advanced example of the All-Soviet Political and Scientific Knowledge Popularization Association in the Soviet Union. Mao Yisheng said that in science popularization work, trade union organizations need the help of science popularization associations, and science popularization associations also need the help of trade union organizations. In the past, our science popularization work has developed vigorously because of this mutual assistance. In the future, we must further strengthen the cooperation between our two associations to strive for greater achievements in science and technology popularization. Mao Yisheng finally hoped that the Science Popularization Association and trade union members would work together under the leadership of the Party to give play to collective strength, further carry out science popularization work among workers, greet a new upsurge in production, and strive to realize the second five-year plan.
    The representatives and observers who spoke at today's conference also included: Li Mingyuan, Teng Shaowu, Shi Mingzhe, Zhang Chengmin, Li Shubin, Zhan Wenhua, Zhao Tiefu, Liu Hailiang and Gao Fengqin (observer).
    During the morning session, the executive chairman announced that Diallo Seydou, Secretary-General of the Black African General Confederation of Labor, who had come from afar, attended today's conference, and the conference expressed a warm welcome to him.

　　工会代表畅谈社会主义竞赛经验
    满怀信心迎接第二个五年计划
    少数民族代表强调加强各族工人的团结
    新华社10日讯　中国工会第八次全国代表大会今天继续举行。来自各地的十八位代表和列席代表，在今天上午和下午分别向大会介绍了他们地区、部门的工会工作情况，并就迎接第二个五年计划、进一步改进工会各方面的工作等有关问题，发表了意见。
    来自新疆、内蒙古、广西等少数民族聚居地区的代表，今天在发言中一致强调要进一步加强各民族工人的团结。他们认为各族工人的团结一致，是建设社会主义的重要保证。
    新疆维吾尔自治区工会联合会副主席吾守诺夫·斯拉木（维吾尔族）说，新疆地区各级工会组织根据党在各个时期所确定的方针、任务，特别重视在职工群众中进行民族团结、国际主义和爱国主义的思想教育工作，因而在职工中消除了反动统治时代所遗留下来的民族歧视和互不尊重等现象。虽然各族职工在日常工作和生活上有着不同的语言和风俗习惯，但是由于有了党的正确而又伟大的民族政策，因此它就能够把我们各族人民团结得像一家人一样，为共同的愿望——建设社会主义的事业而奋斗。
    内蒙古自治区工会联合会主席赵云驶在发言中指出，在党的领导下，自治区工人阶级队伍的团结是巩固的，并且团结了全区各族人民为社会主义建设贡献了伟大的力量。他说，自治区工会在培养民族工人、力求扩大民族职工队伍作了不少工作。现在全区的民族职工人数比1950年大大增加，不少工矿企业里的80％以上的民族职工已经变成了技术工人。为了培养民族工人队伍，自治区工会组织曾经批判了一些认为“民族工人文化低，技术不高，语言不同没法培养”等错误思想，使工会干部认识到只有工人阶级中的民族职工队伍扩大了，才能从根本上加强民族团结，共同建设内蒙古。
    广西省马山县商业工会基层委员陈品明（僮族）在发言中表示，她以一个僮族妇女能够成为商店的职工并被选出席这次大会，感到无比的兴奋。她说，回想过去我们少数民族所受的痛苦，使我更加感到现在在党领导下的民族大家庭的温暖。她向大会表示：要永远记住党的教诲，努力工作，加强学习，以实际行动带动僮族职工，加强同汉族职工和各民族职工的团结，来迎接我国第二个五年计划。
    广大职工开展的群众性的社会主义竞赛，不仅保证了我国第一个五年计划的胜利完成，同时在这一竞赛中也创造了很多的经验，为继续开展社会主义竞赛完成第二个五年计划提供了有利的条件。许多代表今天都谈到了这一问题。甘肃省工会联合会副主席任子和在发言中以甘肃的实际情况说明了社会主义竞赛在建设甘肃地区工业的所起的巨大作用。他说，由于在竞赛中紧紧抓住了总结推广先进经验，注意克服部分外来职工同本地职工中的保守、骄傲思想，认真贯彻执行“互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短、共同提高”的原则，在广大职工群众中很快形成了一种互教互学风气。如上海工人教本地工人，东北工人教山东工人，本地工人帮助外来工人熟悉生产过程和当地的操作经验等。这样就把支援甘肃建设的职工所带来的各种先进经验，经过系统地组织和传播，使之有效地解决了新兴工业地区技术水平落后于生产迅速发展的需要的矛盾，有力地保证了国家建设计划的提前完成。
    辽宁省代表团团长赵敏在发言中，介绍了辽宁省在过去几年中开展社会主义竞赛取得的经验。他认为，要想真正把社会主义竞赛开展起来，并使之深入持久地发展下去，就必须正确地认识社会主义竞赛的作用；在组织竞赛的时候，要自始至终地贯彻群众路线；要坚持党委统一领导，行政、工会、共青团共同负责。
    代表们在发言中对完成第二个五年计划的任务充满了信心。中国农业水利工会筹备委员会主任何英才说，在第二个五年计划期间，我国农业企业和水利建设事业担负着十分繁重的任务。国营农业企业拥有比较现代化的先进技术基础，因此在农业增产运动中必须以实际的行动，在生产上来一个大跃进。水利部门的职工要努力完成第二个五年计划中的水利基本建设任务，以达到逐步根除水害，综合开发利用我国丰富的水力资源。他强调农业水利工会各级组织今后最中心的任务，就是要充分发挥广大职工群众的积极性和创造性，调动一切积极因素迎接和促进农业生产的新高潮。他表示，农业水利的全体职工，一定能够完成农业水利建设的伟大任务。
    著名的劳动模范、上海第二纺织机械厂技师应忠发，鞍钢第一炼钢厂青年友谊炉的青年工人李尚忠，都在大会上表示，要进一步虚心学习，团结一致，在第二个五年计划中作出更大的成绩。
    中国公路运输工会全国委员会主席安力夫，就工会工作中的群众路线问题作了发言。他说，工会要给群众办事，就应当把一切工作看作是群众自己的事，做事和群众商量。在进行工作的时候，采取民主的说服教育的方法。要依靠群众力量，大家动手，要把每一件工作变成为群众自觉自愿的行动。要支持群众中的新生事物，不断地用新的代替旧的，这样就能推动事物发展，运动前进。他还强调工会工作要注意集中群众智慧，总结群众经验，并把这些经验有效地推广到群众中去。
    中华全国科学技术普及协会副主席茅以升在今天下午的大会上，作了“进一步开展职工科学技术普及工作，迎接新的生产高潮”的讲话。他说，科学普及工作是社会主义国家的一个特征，是随着社会主义事业的发展而发展的，因而它为社会主义服务的重要性也是越来越显著的。科普协会就是学习苏联的全苏政治与科学知识普及协会的先进榜样而组织起来的。茅以升说，在科学普及工作上，工会组织需要科普协会的帮助，科普协会也需要工会组织的帮助。过去我们的科学普及工作就是由于这样互相帮助而有了蓬勃发展的。今后我们要进一步加强我们两会的合作，来争取科学技术普及工作的更大的成就。茅以升最后希望科普协会和工会会员共同努力，在党的领导下发挥集体力量，进一步在职工中开展科学普及工作，迎接新的生产高潮，为实现第二个五年计划而奋斗。
    在今天大会上发言的代表和列席代表还有：李明远、滕绍武、施明哲、张承民、栗树彬、粘文华、赵铁夫、刘海量和高凤琴（列席）。
    在上午会议进行中，执行主席宣布，远道赶来的黑非总工会总书记狄亚洛·赛依杜出席了今天的大会，大会对他表示热烈欢迎。
