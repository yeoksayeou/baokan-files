Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Electric Dispatch: In Tianwu Township, Jurong County, Jiangsu Province, the Caixiang Agricultural Cooperative harvested 1,643 jin of rice from 1.1 mu of land, averaging 1,493 jin per mu, breaking the high-yield record of 1,433 jin per mu set by national rice model Chen Yongkang.

　　This high-yield field was originally red and yellow soil, suitable only for growing dryland crops, not rice. Over the past three years, the members of the Fourth Production Team of the Caixiang Agricultural Cooperative have transformed this red and yellow dryland field into black soil paddy fields suitable for rice cultivation by pressing grass turf, spreading lime, and applying chemical fertilizers. They also selected and planted high-quality japonica rice varieties in a timely manner, creating this year's high-yield miracle.

　　This year, the Caixiang Agricultural Cooperative produced a total of 116 mu of "thousand-jin fields," nearly doubling the area planned for cultivating "thousand-jin fields" this spring. The Caixiang Cooperative, which has received the title of Jiangsu Province's Third-Class High-Yield Cooperative for two consecutive years, plans to achieve an average grain yield of 1,200 jin per mu for the entire cooperative next year.

　  江苏省蔡巷农业社水稻赛过陈永康
    新华社南京电　江苏省句容县天五乡蔡巷农业社，有一亩一分田收获稻谷一千六百四十三斤，平均每亩产一千四百九十三斤，突破了全国水稻丰产模范陈永康所创造的每亩产一千四百三十三斤的高产纪录。
    这块高产田原来是红黄土壤，只长旱谷不长稻。近三年来，蔡巷农业社第四生产队的社员们，在这块田里压草皮、铺石灰、施化学肥料，把红黄土旱田改造成适宜水稻生长的黑土水田，选种粳稻良种，及时栽种，创造了今年的高产奇迹。
    蔡巷农业社今年共出现了一百一十六亩“千斤田”，超过了今年春天计划培育“千斤田”面积的近一倍。这个连续两年获得江苏省三等丰产社称号的蔡巷社，计划明年全社粮食平均每亩产量达到一千二百斤。
