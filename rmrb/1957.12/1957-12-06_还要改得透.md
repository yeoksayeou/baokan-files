    Still Need to Reform Thoroughly
    Bo Sheng
    With revolutionary spirit, national colleges and universities are vigorously improving their work. Many schools have begun to establish a new style of study in the rectification and reform, showing vigorous vitality, greatly enlivening the democratic atmosphere of the school, communicating the relationship between leaders and the masses, and solving some problems that could not be solved for a long time in the past. This is the biggest victory achieved by colleges and universities in the rectification movement after the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle. But we cannot be satisfied with the existing achievements. According to the current situation, the rectification and reform work of many colleges and universities has not been thoroughly carried out and needs to be re-examined. Some schools are only satisfied with doing it vigorously for a while, solving some of the opinions put forward by the masses, and then slackening their efforts. Some schools only pay attention to emphasizing the vigorous development of socialist ideological education and launching large-scale debates, but do not make up their minds to severely reform some specific problems raised by the masses first. Some schools believe that they have reformed almost completely, the problems that can be solved have been solved, and some problems cannot be solved even if they are studied for a while.
    These ideas have an impact on improving the work of colleges and universities. These ideas lag behind the demands of the masses. The masses demand that we thoroughly improve our work, and we should catch up. We cannot be satisfied with being vigorous for a while and slack off if the reform is not deep and thorough. All the correct opinions raised by the masses, from small to large, must be changed one by one. Schools that have already launched socialist ideological education debates should also conduct them in conjunction with the rectification and reform work. If we slacken our efforts and do not grasp the rectification and reform, the achievements already made will not be easily consolidated. This will inevitably affect the confidence and enthusiasm of the broad masses in improving their work. In colleges and universities, the socialist ideological education debate should be carried out well. If some schools have indeed thoroughly improved their work and need to launch timely and large-scale debates on the problems and opinions raised by the masses, they can launch special debates to carry out socialist ideological education. If some schools have already carried out socialist ideological education debates, but have not yet thoroughly improved their work, they should also focus the debate on improving their work. Combining rectification and reform with socialist ideological education debates is also the most vivid and practical socialist ideological education. Judging from the current situation of general colleges and universities, it is necessary to concentrate efforts and first severely improve work in this period, and at the same time conduct a review of the previous rectification and reform work, so as to carry out socialist ideological education debates on the basis of improving work. Only in this way can our work be thoroughly improved, and thereby the masses can receive practical education.

    还要改得透
    柏生
    全国高等学校正以革命精神轰轰烈烈地改进工作。许多学校在整改中开始树立了新的学风，出现了蓬勃的朝气，大大活跃了学校的民主空气，沟通了领导和群众的关系，有些过去长期不能得到解决的问题，也获得了解决。这是高等学校继反右派斗争胜利以后，在整风运动中取得的一个最大的战果。但是我们不能满足已有的成绩。根据目前情况来看，也有不少高等学校的整改工作还没有搞透，需要展开复查。有些学校只满足于轰轰烈烈地搞了一下，解决了群众提出来的一部分意见，就松下劲来了。有些学校只注意强调大力开展社会主义思想教育，展开大辩论，而对于群众提出来的一些具体问题，没有下决心先狠狠地改。有些学校则认为已经改得差不多了，能解决的问题已经解决了，有些问题再研究一时也解决不了。
    这些思想，对于改进高等学校的工作是有影响的。这些思想落后于群众的要求。群众要求我们彻底改进工作，我们应该赶上去。我们不能满足于一时的轰轰烈烈，改得不深不透，就松了劲。凡是群众提得对的意见，从小到大，一件件都要改。目前已经开展社会主义思想教育大辩论的学校也要结合整改工作进行。如果我们松了劲，不抓住整改，已经取得的成绩就不容易巩固下来。这必然会影响广大群众对改进工作的信心和积极性。在高等学校中，社会主义思想教育大辩论是要很好地开展的。有些学校如果的确工作改进得彻底了，对群众提出来的问题和意见需要及时展开大争大辩，可以开展专题辩论，进行社会主义思想教育。有的学校已经进行社会主义思想教育大辩论的，如果还没有彻底改进工作，也应该将辩论的中心放到改进工作上来。结合整改，进行社会主义思想教育大辩论，也是最生动的实际的社会主义思想教育。从目前一般高等学校的情况来看，必须集中力量，在这一段时间内先狠狠地改进工作，同时对前一段整改工作进行一次复查，做到在改进工作的基础上，进行社会主义思想教育大辩论。这样才能使我们的工作得到彻底的改进，并从而使群众受到实际的教育。
