    Autumn Harvest Distribution Must Not Be Relaxed
    This winter, rural work is very busy. We must not only conduct rectification in depth, but also engage in large-scale production and construction. Everyone is indeed very tense. However, we must not rush the year-end distribution work because we are busy.
    In fact, distribution work is also an aspect of rectifying the communes. If this work is not done well, the commune members will not be able to concentrate on production and rectification, and the commune will not be able to properly arrange production funds and various economic activities.
    Every commune member hopes to receive his due share of labor results after working hard for a year. If it is thought that production is busy and distribution can be put off, the production enthusiasm of the commune members will inevitably be affected. This seems to be for the sake of production on the surface, but in reality it hinders production.
    Rural work is always busy. If we are not willing to spend a certain amount of time and energy now to seriously solve various problems in distribution, we will leave a tail on this work; and in the future, in order to remove this tail, we will have to recalculate old accounts, make up for loopholes, and spend more energy and time. This is not worth it.
    The Party organization of Zhao Du Township in Jintang County, Sichuan Province, immediately started to solve the problems existing in the distribution work of the cooperative after checking them during the rectification of the commune. This is very good. How is the distribution work of cooperatives in other places progressing? It is also necessary to check it in time.

### 秋收分配不能放松

    秋收分配不能放松
    今年冬季农村工作很繁忙，既要深入进行整风，又要大搞生产建设，大家的确很紧张。但是，决不能因为工作紧张，就把年终分配工作草草放过去。
    实际上，分配工作也是整社工作的一个方面，不把这件工作做好，社员就不能安心生产整社，社也不能妥善地安排生产资金以及各项经济活动。
    每个社员都希望在辛辛苦苦地劳动一年之后，分到自己应得的一份劳动果实。如果认为生产忙，分配可以往后放放，社员生产情绪必然受到影响。这样表面好像是为了生产，实际却是妨碍了生产。
    农村的工作什么时候也是紧张的。现在不肯拿出一定的时间和精力，认真解决分配中的各种问题，就会给这项工作留下尾巴；而以后为了去掉这个尾巴，就得重算旧账，弥补漏洞，花费更多的精力和时间。这笔账是算不过来的。
    四川金堂县赵渡乡党组织在整社中检查出合作社分配工作中存在的问题后，立即着手解决，这是很好的。别的地方合作社分配工作进行得怎样？也有必要及时检查一下。
