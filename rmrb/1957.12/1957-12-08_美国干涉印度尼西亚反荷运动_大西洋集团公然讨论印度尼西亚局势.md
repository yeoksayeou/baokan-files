Xinhua News Agency, December 7th: Washington dispatch: The United States is attempting to interfere in Indonesia's struggle to defend its national rights and interests. According to U.S. officials in Washington on the 6th, U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Allison, has been authorized to urge Indonesians to show "restraint" in their treatment of Dutch residents. The U.S. State Department has also been in contact with the embassy in Indonesia to study whether the Indonesian anti-Dutch movement "hinders" American "aid" to Indonesia.

Speaking to news reporters, Washington officials also said that although there have been no actions or threats against Americans living in Indonesia and the U.S. does not plan to evacuate its citizens, Allison has been authorized to take appropriate action to achieve "greater security" for everyone living in Indonesia.

Xinhua News Agency, December 7th: Paris dispatch: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Permanent Representatives Council held a special meeting today to discuss the so-called "situation in Indonesia."

This meeting was held at the request of the Dutch government.

The meeting did not make a decision on the Dutch request. Reports say that representatives of the member states of the group expressed "sympathy" for the Dutch "difficulties" at this closed-door meeting. A statement issued after the meeting said that the Dutch request has been forwarded to the governments of the member states for consideration.

The Dutch cabinet held an emergency meeting on the 6th, and a statement issued after the meeting said that the Netherlands is prepared to evacuate its citizens from Indonesia.

On the 6th, a British Foreign Office spokesperson chimed in to support the dying Dutch colonialism, saying that the United Kingdom hoped that the Indonesian government would "reconsider" its measures requiring the withdrawal of Dutch residents, and threatened that these measures "will undermine Indonesia's interests and will only create a bad impression everywhere."

Xinhua News Agency, December 7th: London dispatch: Indonesian Ambassador to the United Kingdom Sunarjo pointed out on the 6th that the Indonesian government is unwilling to accept interference from other countries in Indonesia's internal affairs because Indonesia is a sovereign country.

Sunarjo went to the British Foreign Office yesterday morning to explain the actual situation in Indonesia to Oscar Morland, Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Asian Affairs. Afterwards, he made the above remarks to Agence France-Presse reporters.

Sunarjo also said that his meeting with Morland was also to deny false reports published by some newspapers about the treatment of Dutch residents in Indonesia. These rumors included allegations that Dutch residents were being prevented from buying food, and that their water and electricity supplies were being cut off.

The British government stated on the 6th that it hoped that the Indonesian government would reconsider the "discriminatory measures" it planned to take against Dutch residents.

　　美国干涉印度尼西亚反荷运动
　  大西洋集团公然讨论印度尼西亚局势
    新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：美国正企图干涉印度尼西亚维护国家权益的斗争。据华盛顿的美国官员6日说，美国驻印度尼西亚大使艾利逊已经被授权促请印度尼西亚人对待荷兰侨民要有“节制”。美国国务院也一直同驻印度尼西亚大使馆进行联系，研究印度尼西亚反对荷兰的运动是否“妨碍”美国对印度尼西亚的“援助”的问题。
    华盛顿官员在对新闻记者谈话时还说，尽管现在还没有发生反对住在印度尼西亚的美国人的任何行动和威胁，美国也不打算撤侨，但是艾利逊还是被授权采取适当的行动，为生活在印度尼西亚的每一个人取得“更大的安全”。
    新华社7日讯　巴黎消息：北大西洋集团常任代表理事会今天举行特别会议，讨论所谓“印度尼西亚的局势”。
    这次会议是应荷兰政府的要求举行的。
    会议对荷兰的要求没有作出决定。消息说，这个集团各成员国的代表在这次秘密会议上对荷兰的“困难”表示“同情”。会后发表的声明说，荷兰的要求已经转交各成员国政府考虑。
    荷兰内阁6日曾经举行紧急会议，会议后发表的声明说，荷兰已经准备好撤退它在印度尼西亚的侨民的计划。
    英国外交部发言人6日为垂死的荷兰殖民主义帮腔，他说，英国希望印度尼西亚政府“重新考虑”它要求撤出荷兰侨民的措施，他并且威胁地说：这些措施“将损及印度尼西亚的利益，只会在各处造成不良的印象”。
    新华社7日讯　伦敦消息：印度尼西亚驻英国大使苏纳约6日指出，印度尼西亚政府不愿接受其他国家对印度尼西亚内政的干涉，因为印度尼西亚是一个主权国家。
    苏纳约昨天上午曾经前往英国外交部向亚洲事务助理次官奥斯卡·摩兰德说明印度尼西亚的实际情况。事后，他对法新社记者发表了上述谈话。
    苏纳约又说，他去会见摩兰德同时也是为了否认某些报纸所发表的关于在印度尼西亚的荷兰侨民所受到的待遇的错误报道。那些造谣包括所谓不让荷兰侨民购买食物、切断他们的水电供应等等。
    英国政府曾经在6日表示，希望印度尼西亚政府重新考虑它计划对荷兰侨民采取的“歧视措施”。
