Water Has Its Path, Soil Has Its Home, We No Longer Fear Mountain Floods
The Past and Present of Buwa Township

Buwa Township in Mengyin County, Shandong Province, is surrounded by high mountains, with rolling hills in between. Before liberation, due to enemy destruction and devastation, the trees were almost completely cut down, and the mountain skin was stripped bare. Gullies crisscrossed, and silt accumulated, blocking waterways. When the rainy season came, the water flowed without a channel. During heavy rains, mountain floods carried mud and sand, constantly eroding mountain slopes and terraced fields, thinning the soil layer, forming a barren and bald mountain landscape. Before liberation, the average annual yield per mu in the township was only about 100 jin. In 1936, 58 households in the township sold their children due to famine, and 108 households went out to beg for food, accounting for more than half of the total households in the township at that time. "Barren mountains bald, crops withered, little to eat, little to wear, life is really hard." "Five days without rain, we cry to heaven, one night of thunderstorms washes away more than half!" - This was an extremely tragic picture of Buwa Township at that time.

After the cooperativization in the autumn of 1955, Buwa Township launched a large-scale water and soil conservation upsurge. Through the hard work of the masses over the past few years, soil erosion has basically stopped, water and drought disasters have been overcome, and grain production has more than doubled compared with before the war. People have begun to live a happy life. "The cooperative is really good, no worries about food, no worries about fuel"; "Water and soil conservation plays a big role, water has its path, soil has its home, we no longer fear mountain floods, grain production increases year after year." This is the farmers' praise for today's happy life.

Conserve Water and Soil, Create Happiness

This change is the result of the comprehensive development of water and soil conservation work under the leadership of the Party and the government since liberation.

Buwa Township has 11,500 mu of sandy land suitable for cultivation. The farmers first renovated these lands in stages and batches. For the scattered and narrow terraced fields, the focus was on repairing the field dikes, transforming some of the terraced fields into inverted water forms with low inner and high outer edges, leaving waterways, and building water scoops and silt pits. This prevented mountain floods from scouring and soil from flowing away. For relatively flat large areas of land, the method of building field ridges was adopted to raise the surrounding areas of the land to prevent the intrusion of external water. When the rainfall was small, the water was allowed to seep into the ground on the spot, and when it was large, the ridges were broken to release water into the canals. This way, the soil would not be carried away by mountain floods. At the same time, methods such as cutting high and filling low, and adjusting horizontally and vertically were adopted to level the ground and turn small plots into large fields. As for those with irrigation conditions, they were formed into furrow fields. This project started in 1955 and by 1957 a total of 6,975 field ridges were raised, with a length of 172,306 meters; 3,632 field dikes were repaired, with a length of 27,382 meters. These projects can protect 8,505 mu of land, accounting for more than 70% of the total cultivated area.

Relying on the great strength of cooperativization, the farmers of Buwa Township, after comprehensive survey and planning, vigorously built ditches, canals, ponds, and dams to conserve water and soil and develop irrigation. People dredged the already silted waterways according to natural conditions such as water potential and direction, and sealed the mountain gullies suitable for water storage. Then, several tributaries were introduced into the main stream, and the main stream was led into the mountain rivers, avoiding the harm of mountain floods. In order to solve the problem of excessive water force on steep mountain streams, the farmers adopted the method of building "drop pool" to stabilize the turbulent mountain floods before they flowed out of the pool, thus reducing the impact of the water. Small water gates were built at the junctions of dry and tributary ditches to both discharge and store water, so that rainwater could be controlled for irrigation in times of drought. From 1955 to 1957, a large number of small-scale water and soil conservation projects were built. At the same time, the township launched a vigorous movement to dig wells and build reservoirs. During just one winter and spring slack farming season, people dug 406 wells and built two reservoirs on the mountain ridges with low water levels in the rock layers. The quality of these projects was very good. This solved the problem of water shortage in the mountainous areas. In order to make full use of water resources, waterways and aqueducts were also built around the mountains and ridges, and the method of combining water and transporting it over long distances was adopted to solve the difficulties of irrigation due to distance from water and separation by rivers and ditches. A total of six water conveyance canals and seven aqueducts were built around the ridges, and 36 well platforms were raised, so that 189 wells had water conveyance equipment. The method of diverting water for long-distance irrigation can send water to irrigate land more than two li away.

In the past two years, afforestation has also been carried out in a planned way. Different tree species were selected according to the different rocks, soil, and other natural conditions of the mountains. The mountain tops were mainly planted with locust trees, acorns, and other trees, and the mountain slopes were mainly planted with pines, cypresses, and various fruit trees. In the process of afforestation, from semi-self-collecting, self-breeding, and self-planting, it gradually achieved complete self-collecting, self-breeding, and self-planting. In 1956, 480 jin of seeds were collected, 30 mu of seedlings were cultivated, and 300 mu were planted. In 1957, 56 mu of seedlings were cultivated and 700 mu were planted. In the process of afforestation, the policy of "interplanting trees and shrubs, combining agriculture and forestry" was implemented, basically achieving both good and fast results. From 1955 to 1957, more than 8,000 mu (more than 330,000 trees) were planted, with a survival rate of over 80%, covering the barren mountains with green umbrellas and fundamentally changing the original appearance. In addition, measures were taken to protect the mountains and cultivate grass, and mountain grass, honeysuckle, and wax strips were cultivated in a planned way, preventing the masses from stripping the mountain skin. This not only conserved water and soil, but also increased the income of the commune members. In order to take care of the development of animal husbandry, 4,800 mu of pasture and pasture roads were reserved in a planned way, resolving the contradiction between forestry and animal husbandry. One of the difficulties encountered in the early stage of closing the mountains for afforestation was the contradiction with the commune members' burning of grass. After consultation between the agricultural cooperative and the supply and marketing cooperative, the supply and marketing cooperative supplied 430,000 jin of coal, and this contradiction was resolved. Now there is not only no shortage of grass for burning, but also firewood can be sold to the outside.

By grasping the above three basic links, since 1956, the phenomenon of soil erosion has basically stopped, and agriculture and forestry have been able to develop smoothly.

First, mountain floods were controlled and soil erosion was prevented. In the past, every rainy season, about 1 to 5 centimeters of topsoil was eroded on the 11,500 mu of cultivated land. Now the water flows in channels, with both storage and drainage, which not only prevents mountain floods from eroding, but also creates favorable conditions for irrigation and drought resistance. Secondly, the irrigation area has been expanded. According to the existing water conservancy equipment, the 343 water wells, 33 spring pools, and 2 reservoirs that are playing and have played a role can irrigate a total of 3,370 mu of land, accounting for 29% of the total cultivated area. In 1957, the water-irrigated wheat alone reached 1,850 mu, accounting for 52% of the wheat field area. The yield of water-irrigated wheat increased by 50 jin per mu compared with non-irrigated wheat, with a total increase of 92,500 jin. In this autumn's fight against drought, 770 mu of water-irrigated wheat stubble corn and 1,400 mu of sweet potatoes were irrigated one to three times, and 700 mu of land was planted with wheat after watering, ensuring timely planting of wheat. Thirdly, due to the development of water conservancy, the township's replanting area has expanded from 22% last year to 35%.

All these changes are concentrated in the rapid development of production. In 1945, the yield per mu was only 125 jin; in 1955, the annual yield per mu was 220 jin, and each person owned 385 jin of grain, and the state still needed to supply 92,000 jin; in 1956, the annual yield per mu rapidly increased to 315 jin, and each person owned 480 jin of grain, not only eliminating the state's supply, but also selling more than 400,000 jin of surplus grain. In 1957, although it suffered from severe water and drought disasters, due to the huge disaster-resistant role played by water and soil conservation projects in the fight against drought, grain production was still able to reach 330 jin per mu, and each person owned 506 jin of grain, an increase of 26 jin per person compared with 1956. This year, a major flood occurred, and only 4 mu of land were destroyed in the township. In the past, such a large flood would have destroyed thousands of mu of land.

Spirited and High-Spirited

Under the leadership of the Party organization, the people of Buwa Township have shown strong perseverance in the construction with water and soil conservation as the main content. They are never satisfied with their existing achievements, and they are determined to use their hard work to achieve the beautiful goals of "six goods" and "three transformations". The "six goods" are: good afforestation of barren mountains, good repair of ditches and river courses, good repair and maintenance of terraced fields, good development of animal husbandry, good construction of water wells and reservoirs, and good agricultural and sideline production; the "three transformations" are: turning slopes into terraced fields, water conservancy on flat land, and greening all mountains. The broad masses of commune members are full of spirit and high morale in mountainous area construction. "Hard rocks, use cannons to blast, we won't give up until the task is completed!" This is their battle cry.

Now, the Buwa Township branch and the broad masses of commune members have carefully studied and formulated the five-year plan from 1958 to 1962. Its production increase measures are still centered on farmland water conservancy and the development of comprehensive water and soil conservation. It is estimated that by 1962, the threat of drought and flood disasters can be fundamentally eliminated, and a bumper harvest can be maintained even in the event of a famine year. At that time, the irrigation area will increase from the current 29% to more than 80%. Each person will own 1,390 jin of grain.

The barren mountains and ridges, poor mountains and bad waters, and barren and desolate mountainous areas will soon become beautiful mountain villages with clear mountains and waters, green mountains and ridges, and rich and magnificent scenery.

    水有路，土有家，山洪来了再不怕
    埠洼乡的今昔
    山东省蒙阴县埠洼乡四周高山环绕，中间丘岭起伏。解放前由于敌人的摧残、破坏，林木砍伐殆尽，山皮扒光。沟壑纵横，冲积淤塞，雨季到来，水流无道；暴雨时，山洪夹泥沙而下，山坡、梯田不断受冲刷，土层日薄，形成一片童秃秃的荒山秃岭。解放前全乡平均每亩年产量仅一百斤左右。1936年全乡因饥荒出卖儿女的达五十八户，外出逃荒要饭的有一百零八户，占当时全乡总户数的一半以上。“荒山秃秃，禾苗干枯，少吃缺穿，日子真苦。”“五天不雨哭皇天，一夜雷雨去大半！”——这是当时埠洼乡的一幅极其悲惨的图画。
    1955年秋合作化以后，埠洼乡掀起了大规模的水土保持高潮。经过广大群众几年来的辛勤劳动，基本上停止了水土流失，战胜了水旱灾害，粮食产量比战前提高一倍以上。人民开始过上幸福日子。“合作社真正好，不愁吃，不愁烧”；“水土保持作用大，水有路，土有家，山洪来了再不怕，粮食年年有增加”。这就是农民对今天的幸福日子的歌颂。
    保持水土，创造幸福
    这个变化，是由于解放以来在党和政府的领导下，全面开展了水土保持工作的结果。
    埠洼乡共有能够耕作的一万一千五百亩沙岭地，农民首先把这些土地分期分批地进行了整修。对其中零星而狭窄的梯田，着重整修地堰，把部分的梯田整成内低外高倒流水的形式，并留出水道，修建水簸箕、淤土坑。这样就阻止了山洪冲刷和土壤外流。对较平坦的大块土地，采取培地埂的办法，把土地四周加高，防止客水侵入。雨量小时使水就地渗入，大时破埂放水入渠。这样土壤就不会被山洪带走。同时采取铲高填洼、横坝竖调等办法，整平地面，使小地变大田。至于有灌溉条件的，则整成畦田。这种工程从1955年开始，到1957年共加高地埝六千九百七十五道，长十七万二千三百零六公尺；修地堰三千六百三十二道，长二万七千三百八十二公尺。这些工程可以护地八千五百零五亩，占总耕地面积的70％多。
    埠洼乡农民依靠合作化的伟大力量，经过全面勘查规划，大力建筑沟、渠、池、坝，保持水土，发展灌溉。人们根据水势、水向等自然形势，把已经淤塞的水道，加以疏通，把宜于蓄水的山沟，加以封屯。然后把若干支流引入干流，再将干流导入山河，避免了山洪泛滥为害。为了解决山涧陡坡水力过猛问题，农民们采用兴修“跌水消力池”的办法，使凶猛湍急的山洪先跌入池内稳定一下，然后再从池内流出，这样就减轻了水的冲击力。在干沟、支沟衔接处修筑小型水闸，既泄又蓄，把雨水控制起来，以便旱时灌溉。从1955年到1957年，兴修了大量小型水土保持工程，与此同时，这个乡又掀起了轰轰烈烈的打井修水库运动。仅仅一个冬春农闲期间，人们就在山岩层层水位很低的山岭上，打井四百零六眼，修水库两个，这些工程的质量都很好。这就解决了山区缺水的问题。为了充分利用水源，还绕山绕岭修筑水道、修渡槽，采用并水远送办法，解决了因离水远和隔河沟无法灌溉的困难。共修了绕岭输水道六条、渡槽七个，加高井台三十六个，使一百八十九眼井有了输水设备。并流远浇的办法，可以送水灌溉二里以外的土地。
    两年来还有计划地进行了封山造林。根据山岭的不同岩石、土质等自然条件，选择了不同的树种。在山顶以植洋槐、橡子等树为主，在山腰以植松柏和各种果树为主。在造林中由半自采、自育、自植，逐步达到了全部自采、自育、自植。1956年采种四百八十斤，育苗三十亩，插播三百亩。1957年育苗五十六亩，插播七百亩。在造林过程中实行了“乔丛混植，农林兼作”的方针，基本上达到了既好且快。从1955年开始到1957年共植树八千余亩（三十三万余株），成活达80％以上，给荒山罩上了绿伞，基本上改变了原来的面貌。此外还采取了护山养草的办法，有计划地培植山草、银花、腊条等，制止了群众扒山皮的现象。这样，不仅保持了水土，而且也增加了社员的收入。为照顾畜牧业的发展，有计划地留出牧场、牧道四千八百亩，解决了林牧之间的矛盾。在封山造林初期所碰到的一个难题是和社员烧草方面的矛盾。经农业社与供销社协商，由供销社供应煤四十三万斤，这个矛盾也就得以解决。现在不但不缺草烧而且还可以向外出售烧柴。
    由于抓住了以上三个方面的基本环节，自1956年以来，基本上停止了水土流失现象，农林业得以顺利发展。
    首先制服了山洪，防止了水土冲刷。过去每年雨季到来，在一万一千五百亩耕地上，表土冲刷约一至五公分。现在水流有道，蓄泄兼施，不仅阻止了山洪侵蚀，而且为灌溉抗旱创造了有利条件。其次，扩大了灌溉面积。根据现有水利设备来看，正在发挥和已经发挥作用的三百四十三眼水井、三十三个泉水池、二个水库，共能浇地三千三百七十亩，占总耕地面积的29％。1957年仅水浇小麦一项即达一千八百五十亩，占麦田面积的52％，水浇小麦比未浇的小麦每亩增产五十斤，共增产小麦九万二千五百斤。在今秋抗旱中水浇麦茬玉米七百七十亩，地瓜一千四百亩都浇一至三遍，泼地种麦七百亩，保证了小麦适时下种。其三，由于水利的发展，全乡复种面积由去年的22％，扩大到35％。
    所有这些变化，集中表现在生产的迅速发展上面。1945年亩产量仅一百二十五斤；1955年每亩年产量二百二十斤，每人占有粮食三百八十五斤，尚需国家供应九万二千斤；1956年每亩年产量迅速提高到三百一十五斤，每人占有粮食四百八十斤，不仅免除了国家供应，而且还卖余粮四十多万斤。1957年虽遭严重水旱灾害，由于水土保持工程在抗旱中发挥了巨大的抗灾作用，粮食产量仍能达到每亩三百三十斤，每人占有粮食五百零六斤，比1956年每人占有粮食增加二十六斤。今年发生特大洪水，全乡仅冲毁四亩地，过去碰上这样大的洪水要冲毁上千亩地。
    精神饱满，斗志高昂
    埠洼乡人民在党组织的领导下，在以水土保持为主要内容的建设中，表现了强韧的毅力。他们决不满足于已有的成就，他们决心要用自己的辛勤劳动，实现“六好”和“三化”的美好目标。“六好”就是：荒山绿化好，沟渠河道修理好，梯田修整养护好，畜牧业开展好，水井水库修筑好，农副业生产都搞好；“三化”就是：坡地梯田化，平地水利化，有山皆绿化。广大社员在山区建设中精神饱满，斗志高昂。“硬石头，用炮轰，完不成任务不收兵！”这就是他们的战斗口号。
    现在，埠洼乡支部和广大社员已经认真研究制定出1958年至1962年的五年规划。它的增产措施仍然以农田水利和开展综合性的水土保持为中心。预计到1962年可从根本上解除旱涝灾害的威胁，即使遇有荒年也能保持丰收。那时灌溉面积，将由现在29％提高到80％以上。每人占有粮食一千三百九十斤。
    变童山秃岭、穷山恶水、贫瘠荒凉的山区，即将为山明水秀、青山绿岭、富饶瑰丽的山村。（据第二次全国水土保持工作会议材料选编）
