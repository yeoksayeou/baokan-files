Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 28th - Chinese trade union representative Liu Changsheng said at the 25th session of the All-India Trade Union Congress in Ernakulam on the 27th that Chinese workers greatly admire the heroic spirit shown by the Indian working class in defending world peace, consolidating national independence, developing the national economy, and safeguarding the vital interests of workers.

Liu Changsheng represented the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in attending the meeting in Ernakulam, Kerala. He extended his best wishes to the Indian workers and the Indian people.

Liu Changsheng recalled the friendship that has existed between China and India for many centuries, a friendship that has been further strengthened in recent years by the "Panchsheel" principles jointly advocated by the two countries' premiers and the convening of the Bandung Conference. Liu Changsheng said, "The Chinese people love the Indian people from the bottom of their hearts. We are happy for every achievement of the Indian people."

He added: "The trade unions of China and India currently share common hopes and goals, which are to defend peace in Asia and the world, oppose colonialism, consolidate national independence, develop national economies, safeguard the vital interests of workers, further develop Sino-Indian friendship, and continuously strive to promote friendly unity among trade unions worldwide, especially in Asia and Africa."

Liu Changsheng concluded his speech amidst enthusiastic cheers and slogans of "Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai" (Indians and Chinese are brothers). He presented a gift from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to the chairman of the meeting.

Eight fraternal delegations attended the meeting.

When the head of the Soviet delegation appeared on the podium, the audience burst into loud, prolonged applause.

Prior to this, All-India Trade Union Congress General Secretary Dange delivered a report on the problems facing the Indian working class at the opening session. In his report, Dange emphasized the obligations of Indian workers in ensuring the success of India's Second Five-Year Plan and the public sector, as well as in preventing waste and theft in state-owned enterprises. He reiterated the All-India Trade Union Congress's demand for a 25% increase in wages nationwide and said that the demand for unity has greatly increased among Indian workers belonging to various organizations.

The meeting will continue.

    据新华社新德里28日电　中国工会代表刘长胜27日在埃纳库拉姆举行的全印工会大会第二十五届会议上讲话的时候说，中国工人对于印度工人阶级在保卫世界和平、巩固民族独立、发展国民经济和维护工人切身利益方面所表现的英勇精神十分钦佩。
    刘长胜是代表中华全国总工会到喀拉拉邦埃纳库拉姆参加这次会议的。他向印度工人和印度人民表示最良好的祝愿。
    刘长胜追述了中印两国之间已经存在了许多世纪的友谊，这种友谊在最近几年来由于两国总理共同倡导的“潘查希拉”和万隆会议的召开而获得了进一步加强。刘长胜说，“中国人民从心底里热爱着印度人民。我们为印度人民的每一个成就而感到高兴”。
    他又说：“中印两国工会目前都具有共同的希望和目标，这就是为了保卫亚洲和世界和平，反对殖民主义，巩固民族独立，发展民族经济，维护工人的切身利益，进一步发展中印友谊，并且促进全世界特别是亚非各国工会的友好团结而不断努力。”
    刘长胜在热情的欢呼声和“印地秦尼巴依巴依”（中印人民是兄弟）的口号声中结束了他的讲话。他向会议主席赠送了中华全国总工会的礼品。
    有八个兄弟代表团参加了这次会议。
    当苏联代表团团长出现在讲台上的时候，全场响起响亮的、长时间的掌声。
    在这以前，全印工会大会总书记丹吉在开幕会议上就印度工人阶级面临的问题作了报告。丹吉在报告中强调印度工人在保证印度第二个五年计划和公营部分方面，以及在国营企业中防止发生浪费和盗窃现象方面的义务。他重申全印工会大会关于在全国范围内增加工资25％的要求，并且说，在属于各种组织的印度工人当中，团结的要求已经大大增加了。
    会议将继续举行。
