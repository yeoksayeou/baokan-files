Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 18th. The "Alliance" shallow shoal in the middle reaches of the Heilongjiang River, jointly managed by China and the Soviet Union, officially started construction on December 10th after two years of pilot projects. Good news came less than a week after the start of construction: two snow fences, each 100 meters long, have been completed on the construction site. Currently, Chinese and Soviet workers are working side by side, using the "water freezing method" to remove layers of ice from the riverbed in order to carry out the blasting project.

According to Wang Fengqi, the director of the Channel Engineering Department of the Heilongjiang Shipping Administration Bureau, this shallow shoal is near Xingdong Township in Luobei County, China. It is a rocky shoal 3,000 meters long and 80 meters wide. Every shipping season, it has a significant impact on ships from both China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, according to the 1954 agreement of the Sino-Soviet Border River Navigation Committee, the two governments decided to have the shipping departments of both countries clear this shoal. According to experienced shipping experts, this project will take another three to five years to complete.

According to the Sino-Soviet plan, during the ice-bound period this winter and next spring, rocks totaling more than 11,000 cubic meters will be removed from an area of 21,520 square meters of the shoal. To complete this task, 10,000 boreholes, each 1.35 meters deep, need to be drilled in the hard rock, which requires sufficient mechanical equipment and manpower. This year, the Soviet side has again dispatched eight air compressors, seventeen trucks for transportation, as well as bulldozers, water pumps, and generators. The Chinese side has also dispatched one hundred workers, which can effectively guarantee the progress of the project.

    兄弟并肩治石滩
    据新华社哈尔滨18日电　中苏两国共同整治的黑龙江中游“联盟”浅滩，经过两年试验性的工程以后在12月10日正式动工。开工不到一星期就传来了捷报：工地上的两道各一百公尺长的防雪屏已经建成。现在，中苏两国工人正在并肩工作，他们采用“水流冻结法”，一层一层地清除河床上的冰块，以便进行炸滩工程。
    据黑龙江航运管理局航道工程处处长王凤岐对新华社记者说，这个浅滩靠近我国萝北县兴东乡，是个长三千公尺、宽八十公尺的石质浅滩；每年航运季节，它对中苏两国船只都有很大影响。因此，两国政府根据1954年中苏国境河川航行委员会的协议，决定由两国航运部门来清除这个浅滩。据有经验的航运专家认为，这个工程还需要三年到五年才能完成。
    按照中苏双方的计划，这个浅滩要在今冬明春结冰期内，在二万一千五百二十平方公尺的面积上，清除岩石一万一千多立方。完成这个任务，需要在坚硬的岩石上钻一万个一点三五公尺深的钻孔，因而需要充足的机械设备和人力。今年苏联方面又出动了八台空气压缩机，十七台运输用卡车，还有推土机、抽水机和发电机等设备；中国方面又出动了一百名工人，这就能有效地保证工程的进度。
