    Emphasize the Cultivation of Worker and Peasant Students

    The students in the worker class of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry School are all industrial workers transferred from various places. They studied diligently and made rapid progress when they first entered the school. However, some people have now lost confidence in their studies, and some have dropped out halfway and returned to their factories. For example, in Class 308, there were fifty-five students at the beginning of the semester, but only twenty-seven remained after two years. Why did this phenomenon occur? The main reason is that the school leaders have not adequately studied and resolved the difficulties in learning and life faced by the worker class and the cadre transfer class. The allocation of teachers and the pace of the curriculum cannot fully adapt to the characteristics of worker and peasant students. The school has also failed to provide timely care and solutions to students' difficulties in life and family, which has seriously affected their learning motivation, thus leading to the phenomenon of falling behind and dropping out.

    In order to better cultivate intellectuals from worker and peasant backgrounds and strengthen the technical ranks of the working class, it is hoped that relevant parties will give due attention to and resolve the existing problems in the current cultivation of worker and peasant intellectuals.

### 重视培养工农学生

    重视培养工农学生
    北京钢铁工业学校工人班的学生，都是从各地调来的产业工人。他们入学时都努力学习，进步也较快。但是，现在有些人在学习上失去了信心，有的半途退学回厂了。像三○八班，开学时有五十五人，二年后，只剩下二十七人了。为什么出现这种现象呢？主要原因是学校领导上对工人班和调干班的学习和生活上的困难没有很好地研究和解决。在教师的配备和课程的进度上，不能完全适应工农学生的特点。对于学生的生活和家庭方面的困难问题，学校也不能给予及时的照顾和解决，严重地影响了学习情绪，因此，造成了跟不上班和退学的现象。
    为了更好地培养工农出身的知识分子，壮大工人阶级的技术队伍，希望有关方面对目前培养工农知识分子中存在的问题，给予应有的重视和解决。
