Jiangsu People Brave the Cold Winds to Practice Long-Distance Running

    (Our dispatch) Winter sports activities have been widely carried out in Jiangsu Province.

    In order to carry out winter sports activities even better this year, the sports commissions, Communist Youth League, and trade union organizations in Nanjing, Xuzhou, Yangzhou, Jintan, Taixian, and other places have successively issued joint notices to launch winter long-distance running activities. Nanjing has already launched winter long-distance running and the third set of radio calisthenics activities. Currently, major streets and buses in Nanjing are displaying banners calling on people to participate in winter exercise, and many shop windows on the streets are displaying sports photos. Movie theaters are also showing sports slides. Every day, thousands of people are practicing long-distance running and doing radio calisthenics. Leaders of various government offices, factories, and schools attach great importance to winter exercise activities and take the lead in participating. Guo Yingqiu, the president of Nanjing University, gave a mobilization speech at the university's long-distance running kick-off meeting and took the lead in running the first leg of the race.

    Yangzhou and Xuzhou have also widely launched long-distance running activities. Xuzhou is also preparing to hold a farmers' sports meet on the basis of long-distance running exercises. In addition to carrying out long-distance running and other activities, Jintan, Liuhe and other counties are also carrying out rural traditional sports such as stone lifting and stone lock in the countryside.
