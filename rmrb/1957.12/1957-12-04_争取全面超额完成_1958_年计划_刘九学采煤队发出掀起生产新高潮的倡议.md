　　Strive to Comprehensively Overfulfill the 1958 Plan
　　Liu Jiuxue Coal Mining Team Issues Proposal to Launch a New Upsurge in Production
　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 3rd. The Liu Jiuxue Coal Mining Team of the Lifeng Mine in the Jiaozuo Coal Mine, having already overfulfilled the coal mining task of the First Five-Year Plan by more than 49,000 tons, plans to increase coal production by another 21,490 tons for the country by the end of this year. They also plan to increase the coal production volume for next year by 35% compared to the average annual output of the First Five-Year Plan. This plan was proposed in their initiative to launch a new upsurge in production, which was issued to factory and mine workers throughout Henan Province on November 30th.
    The initiative pointed out that they will use the practical actions of completing and overfulfilling the state's production, technology, and financial plans for 1958 to create a good start for the Second Five-Year Plan. They guarantee to produce an additional 5,565 tons of coal on top of fulfilling the state's coal production plan for next year, and to increase production efficiency by more than 3.6% compared to the state plan. They will also vigorously conserve the consumption of various raw materials, ensuring that the timber recovery rate reaches over 85% under safe conditions. The amount of timber used per thousand tons of coal will be reduced by 4.15% compared to the state plan, saving the country 130 cubic meters of timber throughout the year. They will also ensure that over 99% of the projects meet the quality standards for state acceptance, and reduce the gangue content of coal from the state plan's 1.6% to below 1.4%. They guarantee that there will be no serious injuries or major accidents.
    Liu Jiuxue is a nationally renowned labor model. The Jiaozuo Lifeng Mine, where his coal mining team is located, is an old mine that was plundered and exploited by American and British imperialism for decades before liberation, leaving the remaining coalfields riddled with holes. In order to complete this year's production increase task and next year's production plan, they have formulated a series of measures to overcome various difficulties.

　　争取全面超额完成1958年计划
    刘九学采煤队发出掀起生产新高潮的倡议
    新华社郑州3日电　焦作煤矿李封矿刘九学采煤队在已经超额四万九千多吨完成第一个五年计划采煤任务的基础上，又计划到今年底再为国家增产煤炭二万一千四百九十吨，并计划使明年的产煤量比第一个五年计划平均年度产量提高35％。这个计划，是他们11月30日向河南全省厂矿职工发出的掀起生产新高潮的倡议书中提出的。
    倡议书中指出，他们将以完成和超额完成1958年国家的生产、技术、财务计划的实际行动，为第二个五年计划创造一个良好的开端。他们保证明年在完成国家产煤计划的基础上，再增产五千五百六十五吨煤炭，生产效率要比国家计划提高3.6％多。并且大力节约各种原材料的消耗，保证在安全条件下，做到坑木收回率达到85％以上。每千吨煤使用坑木数量比国家计划降低4.15％，全年为国家节省坑木一百三十立方。并使99％以上的工程合乎国家验收的质量标准，煤的含矸率由国家计划的1.6％，降低为1.4％以下。保证不发生重伤和重大责任事故。
    刘九学是全国的著名劳动模范。他领导的采煤队所在的焦作李封矿，是一个在解放前被美、英帝国主义掠夺开采了几十年的老矿，残存的煤田千疮百孔。他们为了完成今年的增产任务和明年的生产计划，订了一系列的措施来克服种种困难。
