Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 28th December: The Changsha County Committee of the Communist Party of China, Hunan Province, recently investigated and researched three representative agricultural cooperatives in mountainous, hilly, and plain areas, and put forward the question of how to rapidly develop the collective economy to consolidate agricultural cooperatives.

The three cooperatives are Hengshan’ao Cooperative, Jinghua Cooperative, and Wangxin Fourth Sub-cooperative. They have all been operating for three years, with production increasing year by year. Last year, they caught up with the production level of local wealthy middle peasants, and 37.5% of the households reached the income level of wealthy middle peasants. However, these three cooperatives have a common tendency: the collective income increases slowly, while the income from household sideline occupations increases rapidly. In these three cooperatives, the collective income accounted for 55.2% of the total income and household sideline income accounted for 44.8% in 1955; in 1956, the collective income decreased to 50.3%, and household sideline income increased to 49.7%. This year, the collective income only accounts for 41.59%, while household sideline income has increased to 58.41% (according to the county committee's investigation in many other cooperatives, the current household sideline income generally accounts for about 30%-50%).

Because the collective income in the cooperatives increases slowly, there are few collective production projects, the private income of the members increases quickly, and there are many management projects, the spontaneous capitalist tendencies among the members have greatly risen. Among the 234 new and old upper-middle peasants in these three cooperatives, about 40% only care about personal family production and ignore collective production. Many of them have even developed to speculation and profiteering, and 26 households have developed to disrupting the state market. Some of the poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants are also affected, unwilling to work and invest in the cooperatives. According to the original plan, the members of these three cooperatives needed to do more than 150,000 workdays in the cooperatives this year, but only 68.1% was completed; the manure plan that the members should contribute to the cooperatives was only half completed. This has caused great losses to the collective production of the cooperatives.

The investigation materials point out: The above situation is mainly due to the lack of sufficient understanding of the struggle between the two roads in developing agricultural production after cooperation. Not enough attention is paid to how to make appropriate arrangements for the production of the cooperatives and the members, and there is a lack of clear division between collective and individual management. Many cooperative cadres are afraid that there will be too many and badly run production and management projects in the cooperatives, so they do not collectively manage the sidelines that can be collectively managed, and do not include what should be included in the cooperatives. The collective production of these three cooperatives mainly includes rice, coarse grains, and live pigs, while the production projects managed by the members individually are as many as 26. The public accumulation of the cooperatives increases very slowly, accounting for only 3.4% of the total income, which affects the expansion of reproduction.

The investigation materials emphatically point out: First, this issue must be taken as one of the important topics in the rural rectification movement, mobilizing the masses to speak out freely, contend in a big way, and debate thoroughly. Through summarizing the superiority of the cooperatives and this year's production, thoroughly criticize the tendency to weaken the collective economy of the cooperatives, and consciously safeguard collective interests. On the basis of solving ideological problems, several specific regulations must also be implemented: (1) According to the production needs of the cooperatives and the labor situation of the members, stipulate the basic workdays of different standards for the members, and reward the members who exceed the basic workdays. (2) According to the amount of human and animal manure of each household, stipulate the proportion to be handed over to the cooperatives, and reward those who exceed it. (3) The private plots of the members can only be used to grow vegetables and pig feed, as well as economic crops for personal use. (4) Stipulate that members shall not violate the cooperative regulations and prohibit speculation and profiteering. Second, actively expand the scope of collective management. Third, increase public accumulation and expand reproduction. According to the statistics of the three cooperatives, the public accumulation in the three years of operation is only 4,500 yuan. The production funds in the cooperatives are mostly from state loans and temporary fundraising, which cannot strongly support production and vigorously carry out basic construction. If the three cooperatives can accumulate 8%, they can basically rely on themselves to solve the funding problem. The investigation materials point out: After the three cooperatives take these measures, it is expected that the collective economy will have a great leap forward.

    长沙县经过调查研究提出重要问题
    迅速发展农业社集体经济
    新华社长沙28日电　中共湖南省长沙县委员会最近在山区、丘陵区和平原区调查研究了三个有代表性的农业社，提出如何迅速发展集体经济来巩固农业社的问题。
    这三个社是横山坳社、荆华社和望新四分社，都已办了三年，生产年年增加，去年就赶上了当地富裕中农的生产水平，并有37.5％的户赶上了富裕中农的收入水平。但是，这三个社有一个共同的倾向：集体收入增加慢，社员家庭副业收入增加快。这三个社1955年集体收入占总收入的55.2％，家庭副业收入占44.8％；1956年集体收入下降到50.3％，家庭副业收入上升到49.7％。而今年，集体收入只占41.59％，家庭副业收入却增到58.41％（根据县委在其他许多社的调查，目前家庭副业收入一般占30％—50％左右）。
    由于社里集体收入增加慢，集体生产项目少，社员私人收入增加快，经营项目多，社员中资本主义自发倾向就大大抬头。这三个社新、老上中农二百三十四户中，只顾个人家庭生产、不顾集体生产的约占40％左右，其中有许多户甚至发展到投机倒把，有二十六户已发展到捣乱国家市场。贫农和新、老下中农也有一部分人受到影响，不愿在社里出工和投资。按照原来规划，这三个社的社员今年需要在社里做十五万多个劳动日，结果只完成68.1％；社员应向社里投的家肥计划，也只完成一半。这就使得社里集体生产受到很大损失。
    调查材料指出：上述情况的产生，主要是由于对合作化以后发展农业生产上两条道路的斗争缺乏足够的认识。对社与社员的生产如何作恰当的安排注意不够，对于集体和个人经营的界限缺乏明确的划分。不少社干部怕社内生产经营项目搞多了搞不好，把能集体经营的副业不集体经营，应入社的不入社。这三个社集体生产的主要是稻谷、杂粮、生猪等几个项目，而社员个人经营的生产项目却有二十六项之多。社里公共积累增加很慢，只占总收入的3.4％，影响到扩大再生产。
    调查材料着重指出：第一，必须把这个问题作为农村整风中的重要课题之一，发动群众大鸣大放大争，通过总结合作社的优越性和今年生产，彻底批判削弱合作社集体经济的倾向，自觉的维护集体利益。在解决思想问题的基础上，还要贯彻几项具体规定：（1）按社里生产需要和社员劳力情况，规定社员不同标准的基本劳动日，对超过基本劳动日的社员实行奖励。（2）按照各户的人、畜家肥，规定交社的比例，超过的实行奖励。（3）社员自留地规定只能种吃菜和猪饲料以及自用经济作物。（4）规定社员不得违反社章，禁止做投机倒把生意。第二，积极扩大集体经营的范围。第三，增加公共积累，扩大再生产。据三个社统计，办社三年公共积累只有四千五百元，社内生产资金多是由国家贷款和临时筹集，不能有力支持生产和大力搞基本建设。如果三个社能积累8％，就基本上可以依靠自己解决资金问题。调查材料指出：这三个社采取这些措施之后，预计集体经济就将有一个大跃进。
