Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Electric Dispatch According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Electric Dispatch: Macheng County, Hubei Province, which had a bumper harvest of grain and cotton this year, has issued a socialist competition challenge to all counties in the province, striving for a great leap forward in agriculture next year. Macheng County's challenge letter has been published in the Hubei Daily on the 23rd. Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, wrote an article entitled "Learn from Macheng," calling on all counties to conduct a friendly competition with Macheng County.
    The conditions for the competition proposed by the county in its challenge to all counties in the province are: 1. Grain: The total grain output of the county in 1958 will increase by 27.5% compared with 1957, reaching an average yield of 950 jin per mu, striving for 1,000 jin. Among them, the average yield per mu of 680,000 mu of rice in 1957 was 666 jin, and in 1958 it will reach 800 jin, an increase of 20% compared with 1957; 300,000 mu of wheat will guarantee an average yield of 300 jin per mu, an increase of 50% compared with 1957, and create 30,000 mu of high-yield wheat fields yielding 1,000 jin per mu.
    2. Cotton: The average yield per mu is guaranteed to be 130 jin of ginned cotton, an increase of 26% compared with 1957, striving to reach 150 jin of ginned cotton per mu; create 20 high-yield cooperatives with an average yield of 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and cultivate 10,000 mu of high-yield fields with an average yield of 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu.
    3. Develop diversified operations in mountainous areas: In 1958, tea gardens will be expanded to 27,500 mu, an increase of 22,000 mu compared with 1957; develop 90,000 mu of Chinese fir; the amount of silkworm rearing will increase by 15% compared with 1957, and the output of silk will increase by 22% compared with 1957. The challenge letter said: "The above indicators, except for particularly large natural disasters, must be guaranteed under normal weather conditions."
    In order to complete the above tasks, the challenge letter said, they decided to make efforts in three aspects:
    First, transform nature. (1) It is decided to extract 60% of the labor force to work hard on water conservancy for three months this winter and next spring. Intercept six rivers, open canals with a length of 2,200 li, and build 237 small reservoirs irrigating more than 300 mu, accumulate river water and rainwater, dig out underground water, and move towards the goal of water conservancy cooperation, systematization, and automatic irrigation and drainage. In 1958, the guaranteed harvest area will be expanded by 340,000 mu, making the paddy fields reach 85% guaranteed harvest. (2) In this winter and next spring, 30% of the labor force will be extracted to engage in large-scale fertilizer accumulation. From the county party committee to the cooperative cadres, there are special personnel responsible for leadership. Before the Spring Festival of 1958, the county will complete the following basic construction of fertilizer accumulation: every household has a pigsty, a cattle pen, every team has a large manure cellar, every plot of land has a manure pit, and every village has a toilet. The quantity and quality of fertilizer applied per mu of land will increase by 50% compared with 1957, reaching the equivalent of 150 jin of soybean cake of natural fertilizer per mu of land. (3) Of the 120,000 mu of low-yield land in the county, 50,000 mu will be transformed this winter and next spring, making the average yield per mu of these 50,000 mu increase by 50%, or even doubled, compared with 1957.
    Second, improve production tools and improve the level of cultivation technology. In 1958, the plain areas will basically use new and improved agricultural tools, and the county will promote 4,000 light rubber-wheeled carts. Seize this winter and next spring to do a good job in seed selection and pest control preparations, resolutely and thoroughly implement comprehensive technical measures, and strive to allow crops to grow according to people's requirements.
    Third, further improve leadership methods, let go of mobilizing the masses, and give full play to the heroic spirit and infinite wisdom of the broad masses in marching towards nature. (1) Seize planning as a driving force, carry out a mass debate, calculate the benefits of realizing the plan to households, and promote the "one-year-early-knowing" chart working method (the "one-year-early-knowing" working method was created by the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Province. This method is to make a chart of the cooperative's production, labor arrangement, income and other aspects and distribute it to the members to paste in their homes, so that the members can understand the production and income arrangements for the whole year and the number of labor days that should be contributed, so as to promote the labor enthusiasm of the members), so that the plan becomes the will and action of the masses, and then after the field team standing (classification), the crops, yields, fertilizers, and technical measures of each field in 1958 are determined, so that every cadre and member understands the yield increase methods of each field, so that the actions of the masses are all for the realization of the plan, and everything is inseparable from the plan. This year, we must conduct inspections in stages and seasons according to the plan. (2) Require all cadres to engage in experimental fields, participate in production and lead production, and achieve five skills: be able to cultivate land, be able to cultivate and weed, be able to make and apply fertilizer, be able to control pests, and be able to use new agricultural tools. Require all cadres to do: first do a good job of all technical measures in their own experimental fields as an example, and educate the masses with facts. Cadres should not only change from laymen to experts, but also gradually change from experts to specialists. (3) Leaders at all levels should do a good job in key areas and drive the work in general areas, and make a breakthrough in transforming the face of backward areas. In 1958, conduct three to four county-wide visits and evaluations. The county party committee will personally lead the team in batches. Each visit will conduct a comprehensive inspection of every cooperative in the county, commend the advanced, and spur on the backward.
    The challenge letter concludes: "We are determined to learn humbly from the experiences of all parts of the country and the province, overcome arrogance and impetuosity, and strive for a comprehensive leap forward in agriculture with the spirit of moving mountains and filling the sea."

    开展友谊竞赛　争取全面跃进
    麻城向湖北全省农业社发出社会主义竞赛挑战书
    据新华社武汉电　今年粮、棉大丰收的湖北省麻城县，向全省各县发出了开展社会主义竞赛的挑战书，争取明年在农业上来一个大跃进。麻城县的挑战书已刊登在23日湖北日报上。省委第一书记王任重写的题为“向麻城看齐”的文章中，号召各县和麻城县进行友谊竞赛。
    这个县在给全省各县挑战书中提出的竞赛条件是：一、粮食：1958年全县粮食总产量比1957年提高27.5％，达到每亩平均产量九百五十斤，争取一千斤。其中六十八万亩水稻1957年每亩平均产量是六百六十六斤，1958年达到八百斤，比1957年提高20％；三十万亩小麦保证平均亩产三百斤，比1957年提高50％，并创造小麦千斤亩三万亩。
    二、棉花：每亩平均产量保证一百三十斤皮棉，比1957年提高26％，争取达到亩产一百五十斤皮棉；创造平均亩产皮棉二百斤的丰产社二十个，培育一万亩平均亩产籽棉一千斤的丰产田。
    三、发展山区多种经营：1958年茶园扩大到二万七千五百亩，比1957年增加二万二千亩；发展杉木九万亩；养蚕量比1957年增加15％，蚕丝产量比1957年提高22％。挑战书说：“上述指标除了特大的自然灾害以外，在一般年景下，都要保证作到。”
    为完成上述任务，挑战书说，他们决定从三个方面来努力：
    首先，要改造自然。（1）决定在今冬明春抽出60％的劳动力大干三个月水利。拦住六道河，开渠长度达二千二百华里，修建灌溉三百亩以上的小型水库二百三十七个，把河水、雨水积蓄起来，把地下的水挖出来，向水利合作化、系统化，排灌自动化的目标前进一步。1958年保收面积扩大三十四万亩，使水田达到85％保收。（2）在今冬明春抽出30％的劳动力大搞积肥，从县委到社干部，都有专人负责领导。1958年春节前全县要完成下述积肥的基本建设：户户有猪圈，有牛栏，队队有大粪窖，丘丘田有粪坑，村村有厕所。每亩田施肥的数量和质量要比1957年增加50％，达到每亩田施足相当于一百五十斤豆饼的自然肥料。（3）全县的低产田地十二万亩，今冬明春改造五万亩，使这五万亩田每亩平均比1957年增产50％，甚至一倍。
    第二，改进生产工具提高耕作技术水平。1958年平畈地区基本上全部使用新式和改良农具，全县推广轻便胶轮板车四千部。抓住今冬明春作好选种和除虫等准备工作，坚决地、彻底地贯彻综合技术措施，努力争取让庄稼按照人的要求生长。
    第三，进一步改进领导方法，放手发动群众，充分发挥广大群众向自然进军的英雄气概和无穷的智慧。（1）抓住规划作为动力，开展全民大辩论，把实现规划的好处算账到户推行“一年早知道”图表工作方法（按“一年早知道”工作方法是山西省襄垣县前进农业社创造的。这种方法是把全社生产、劳力安排、收入等方面计划制成一张图表发给社员贴在自己家里，使社员了解全年的生产、收入安排和应出的劳动工数，促进社员的劳动积极性），使规划变成群众自己的意志和行动，然后经过田的站队（分类），把每一块田地1958年的作物、产量、肥料、技术措施都确定下来，使每个干部和社员都明白每一块田的增产办法，使群众的行动一切为了实现规划，事事不离规划，今年要分段分季对照规划进行检查。（2）要求全体干部搞试验田，参加生产领导生产，做到五会：会整田，会中耕除草，会造肥施肥，会除虫，会使用新式农具。要求全体干部都要做到：一切技术措施首先在自己的试验田里亲手作好样子，以事实教育群众。干部不仅要由外行变为内行，还应当逐步地由内行变为专家。（3）层层领导作好重点地区工作并带动一般地区工作，突击改造落后地区的面貌。1958年搞三—四次全县范围的参观评比，县委分片亲自带队，每次参观对全县每一个社都要进行一次全面的检查，表扬先进，鞭策后进。
    挑战书最后写道：“我们决心虚心学习全国、全省各地的经验，戒骄戒躁，以移山填海的干劲，争取农业全面大跃进。”
