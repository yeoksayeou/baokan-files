Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd Dispatch from New York: American newspapers continue to express great concern about the fact that the Soviet Union's scientific achievements have surpassed those of the United States.

    The "Washington Post" published an article by renowned commentator Pearson on the 28th, stating that the recent secret report to Congress by CIA Director Allen Dulles on the comparison of military and scientific strength between the United States and the Soviet Union was "shocking." "The disheartening and inevitable conclusion drawn from this report is that today the United States has become a second-rate country." Pearson compared the current situation of the United States to a "chilly winter," pointing out that due to the successful Soviet intercontinental missile tests, the forward bases of the US Strategic Air Command could be destroyed by missiles, and these bases would become another useless "Maginot Line."

    The Scripps-Howard newspaper "World-Telegram and Sun" published an editorial titled "We (the US) are Behind Russia," stating that at the end of World War II, the United States had a "monopoly" on atomic energy, was "far ahead" in radar, and had at least "equal status" in missiles. The newspaper asked, where is the United States today? It said that in science and technology, the United States has been caught up by the Soviet Union, and even surpassed in some respects.

    The editorial said that Dr. Teller believes that the Soviet Union's efforts in nuclear physics are already "fully comparable to the efforts of the United States"; in missiles, the Soviet Union is ahead; and in radar, he "doubts whether the United States is still leading."

    Carl Kalman, a senior American missile advisor to NATO, said on the 1st that he was not surprised that the Soviet Union had moved ahead of the United States in rocket development, but he was "very surprised" by the Soviet Union's technological and production progress in recent years. He said that the Soviet Union could use several missiles to defeat the "attack force" of NATO's Western Europe.

Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd Dispatch from Paris: French representative to the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee, Mock, admitted that the successful launch of the Soviet artificial satellite opened a new era, indicating that the United States was no longer in a strategically superior position where it could only strike others without being hit.

    He said at a luncheon on November 29: "The United States is now on the front line, finding itself as vulnerable as other countries, so we must reconsider all our military and political issues."

　　苏联科学猛进　美国优势已去
    皮尔逊说：美国已经沦为二等国
    莫克说：法国应该重订国家大计
    据新华社3日讯　纽约消息：美国报刊对于苏联的科学成就超过美国一事继续表示很大的忧虑。
    “华盛顿邮报”28日发表著名评论员皮尔逊的一篇文章说，美国中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯最近在国会所作的关于美苏两国在军事和科学力量对比的秘密报告是“令人吃惊”的，“从这个报告中得出的令人丧气的不可避免的推论是：今天美国已经成为二等国家”。皮尔逊把美国目前的处境比作“阴冷的冬季”，他指出，由于苏联洲际导弹试验成功，美国战略空军的前进基地已经可以被导弹摧毁，这些基地将要成为另一条无用的“马奇诺防线”。
    斯克利浦斯—霍华德系报纸“世界电讯与太阳报”以“我们（美国）落在俄国后面”为题发表社论说，在第二次世界大战结束的时候，美国在原子能方面有“垄断地位”，在雷达方面“遥遥领先”，在导弹方面至少有“平等地位”。报纸问道，美国今天是在什么地方呢？它说，在科学技术方面，美国已经被苏联赶上，在某些方面甚至被它超过。
    社论说，泰勒博士认为苏联在原子核方面的努力已经“完全可以同美国的努力相匹敌”；在导弹方面，苏联走在前面；在雷达方面，他“怀疑美国是否仍然领先”。
    北大西洋公约组织的美国高级导弹顾问卡尔曼1日说，他对苏联在火箭发展方面已经走在美国前面这一点并不感到惊奇，但是他对于苏联最近几年在科学技术上和生产方面的进步感到“十分惊奇”。他说，苏联可以用几个导弹来打败北大西洋公约组织的西欧“攻击力量”。
    新华社3日讯　巴黎消息：法国出席联合国裁军小组委员会代表莫克承认，苏联人造卫星的发射成功展开了一个新纪元，它表明美国已经不再处在只是打人而不会挨打的战略优越地位。
    他11月29日在一个午餐会上讲话说：“美国现在处在第一线，发现它自己像其他国家一样易受攻击，因此我们必须重新考虑我们的全部军事和政治问题。”
