How the Blizzard in Northeast China Formed?

From the evening of the 16th of this month to the morning of the 20th, heavy blizzards occurred successively in various parts of Northeast China. In the suburbs of Shenyang and Harbin, the accumulated snow reached two to three *shi chi* (Chinese feet), and highway and railway transportation were once interrupted, greatly hindering passenger and freight transport. What caused this blizzard?

Since the beginning of winter this year, the Northeast region of China has been warmer than in previous years. For example, in Shenyang and Harbin, the temperatures (air temperature) in November were three to four degrees Celsius higher than the average temperature in previous years. Before December 15th, this trend continued. In areas with higher temperatures, the air pressure (referred to as air pressure) will also be lower. Therefore, at 8:00 AM on December 16th, a small low pressure area (with a low central air pressure) formed in the warmer region of the Liaohe Plain. At this time, a large tongue of cold air extended from the polar region at high altitude, like the giant hand of a giant, inserted into the sky above Northeast China. This cold air tongue is called a high-altitude large low-pressure trough in meteorology. When the high-altitude large low-pressure trough combined with the small low pressure on the ground in the Liaohe Plain, it developed into a "giant storm" on December 17th and 18th. This giant storm was very large, with a diameter of two to three thousand kilometers. It included the three northeastern provinces of China, the eastern part of the Bohai Sea, the northern part of the Yellow Sea, the Sea of Japan, the Korean Peninsula, and the Primorsky Krai and Sakhalin Island of the Soviet Union.

The "giant storm" mainly developed from the strengthening of the high-altitude large low-pressure trough (cold air tongue). During the development process, because the upper layer was cold and the lower layer was warm, and the light and heavy were inverted, the air presented a very unstable state, which produced very thick clouds, causing rain and snow. In addition, when water vapor in the air condensed, the release of latent heat accelerated the upward movement of the air, making the air even more unstable, and the rain and snow became heavier and heavier. At the same time, because the updraft in the storm was strong, more air flowed out from above and less flowed in from below. The air pressure on the ground decreased accordingly, the low pressure deepened, and the storm became stronger. When the difference in air pressure inside and outside the storm became larger and larger, the wind force also increased. Moreover, the movement of the "giant storm" was relatively slow, which caused three days and three nights of continuous heavy blizzards in the three northeastern provinces of China. (Fu)

    东北的大风雪是怎样形成的？
    从本月16日晚上到20日早晨，东北各地先后出现了大风雪。沈阳和哈尔滨市郊积雪达二、三市尺，公路、铁路交通一度中断，客货运输受到了很大的阻碍。为什么会出现这次大风雪呢？
    今年入冬以来，我国东北地区比往年暖和，如沈阳、哈尔滨等地，11月份气温（空气温度）都比历年平均气温高过摄氏三至四度；12月15日以前，也有这样的趋势。在温度高的地方，空气压力（简称气压）也会低些。因此，12月16日八时，在辽河平原较暖的地区形成了一个小低压（中心气压低的）。这时候，高空从极地伸出来一个大冷空气舌，好像巨人的魔掌，插入了东北上空。这个冷空气舌，气象学上叫做高空大低压槽。当高空大低压槽和辽河平原地面的小低压相结合以后，在12月17日到18日两天，便发展成为“巨大风暴”了。这个巨大风暴是非常庞大的，直径达二三千公里。包括有我国东北三省、渤海东部、黄海北部、日本海、朝鲜半岛和苏联的滨海省及库页半岛等。
    “巨大风暴”主要是由高空大低压槽（冷空气舌）加强而发展起来的。在发展的过程中，因为上冷下暖，轻重倒置，空气呈现着很不稳定的状态，就产生很厚的云层，而下降雨雪。加之空气里水汽凝结时，潜热的释放，又加快了空气的上升运动，空气就更加不稳定，雨雪也就越来越大。同时因为风暴里上升气流旺盛，空气从上面流出去的多，从下面流进的少。当地地面空气压力随着减小，低气压也加深，风暴愈加强。当风暴里外相邻气压相差越来越大的时候，风力也就加大起来。并且“巨大风暴”的移动，也是比较缓慢的，所以造成了我国东北三省三天三夜的连续大风雪。　　（辅）
