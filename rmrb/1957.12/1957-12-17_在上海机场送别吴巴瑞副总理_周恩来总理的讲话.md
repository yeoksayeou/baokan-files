　　At Shanghai Airport Bidding Farewell to Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe
    Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

    Dear Deputy Prime Minister, Friends, Comrades:

    Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe and his wife, as well as other Burmese friends who came with him, are about to leave China. With boundless reluctance to part, and in China's largest city, Shanghai, I once again, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, thank you for your visit and ask you to take back to Burma the Chinese people's brotherly friendship for the Burmese people.

    Your Excellency, although your stay in China was not long, our national leaders have had the opportunity to further exchange views with you and Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein on issues of common concern to China and Burma, thereby increasing mutual understanding. This is of great significance for the development of Sino-Burmese friendship and the advancement of peace in Asia and the world.

    According to the agreement between you and me, Your Excellency will visit China again next spring. The Chinese government and people eagerly look forward to that day. The people of Shanghai will also eagerly look forward to that day.

    Let us renew the friendship of old friends again when spring is in full bloom!

    Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!

    Long live peace in Asia and the world!

　　在上海机场送别吴巴瑞副总理
    周恩来总理的讲话亲爱的副总理阁下，朋友们，同志们：
    吴巴瑞副总理阁下和他的夫人以及同来的其他缅甸朋友们快要离开中国了。我怀着无限的惜别之情，并且在中国最大的城市上海，代表中国政府和人民再一次感谢你们的访问，请您们把中国人民对于缅甸人民的兄弟般的友情带回缅甸。
    阁下，您虽然在中国逗留的时间不长，我国的国家领导人们已经有机会同您和吴觉迎副总理就中国和缅甸两国共同关心的问题进一步交换了意见，从而增加了彼此间的了解。这对于发展中缅两国友谊和推进亚洲和世界和平事业具有重要意义。
    按照阁下同我的约定，阁下将在明年春天再来中国访问。中国政府和人民热切地期待着这一天的到来。上海的人民也一定会热切地期待这一天的到来。
    让我们到春暖花开的时候再一次重叙老朋友的情谊吧！
    中缅友好万岁！
    亚洲和世界和平万岁！
