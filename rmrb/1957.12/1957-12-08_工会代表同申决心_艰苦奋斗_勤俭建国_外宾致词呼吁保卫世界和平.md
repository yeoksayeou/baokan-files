Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: The Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions continued today. Six delegates and four foreign guests spoke and delivered congratulatory messages at the morning session.

    Xi Zhanyuan (Minister of the Labor Insurance Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions) spoke on labor insurance work. He said that at the "Seventh National Congress" of the trade union, the number of workers covered by labor insurance was 3.3 million, and by June of this year, it had reached 9.09 million; the state's annual expenditure on labor insurance has also increased from 33.27 million yuan in 1951 to 165.74 million yuan in 1956. In addition, the workers' sanatoriums and mass prevention of illness and injury work organized by the trade union have also greatly developed. However, there are still many shortcomings in the current labor insurance work that need to be further adjusted and overcome. Xi Zhanyuan said that assisting the government in improving the current labor insurance system is an important task for trade union organizations. Improving the labor insurance system should start from China's actual situation, from the 600 million population, from the development of production, consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, and strengthening the unity of the working class.

    Lin Maoxiang (Vice Chairman of the Trade Union of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration) said in his speech that trade union organizations must not only mobilize the masses to do a good job in production but also care about the lives of the workers. Ignoring the lives of the masses is wrong, but making excessive demands is also wrong. Our working class is the leading class and should be responsible to the 600 million people. Trade union workers must support reasonable demands of the masses and help solve them; for unreasonable demands that cannot be met for the time being, we should strengthen education, use the spirit of hard struggle from the "February 7th" strike, overcome various difficulties, and do a good job.

    Zhong Min (Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions) mentioned in his introduction of Shanghai factories' experience in carrying out the rectification movement that the masses raised many opinions during the rectification, exposing the shortcomings of our trade union work. We will rely on the supervision and assistance of the vast number of workers during this rectification process to boldly, resolutely, and thoroughly improve these shortcomings. After the rectification, our trade union work will surely present a new look.

    Bu Hongyun (Chairman of the Taiyuan Federation of Trade Unions) introduced the rectification situation of the Xishan Coal Mine in Taiyuan in his speech. He said that facts have proved that freely mobilizing the masses to speak out freely not only does not hinder production but is bound to set off a new upsurge in production. There is no doubt that the nationwide rectification will have a profound impact on China's workers' movement.

    Sun Guorong (Chairman of the Trade Union of Tianjin Public Transport Company) expressed his views on how grassroots trade union organizations can implement the principle of "both rectification and production without hindrance". He said that after the start of the rectification movement, the trade union organization of the Tianjin Public Transport Company organized temporary competition inspection and propaganda groups in each workshop to regularly inspect the progress of the competition and the competition propaganda work. Leaders at all levels of the company paid attention to relying on the masses to carry out mass technical activities during the rectification movement, constantly breaking through the weak links in production, thus effectively guaranteeing production.

    Sudarno, the representative of the All-Indonesia Muslim Trade Union, said in his congratulatory message, "Because the struggle to win West Irian back to the Republic of Indonesia through peaceful means within the framework of the United Nations has been frustrated, I request your support. Now the workers and the government have taken a clear position to take over Dutch enterprises. We do not hate the Dutch people, but we hate the policies of Dutch imperialism." Sudarno also said, "In order to build our country, we will learn from you, and we will unhesitatingly learn from your good and useful experiences that conform to the national and national characteristics of Indonesia."

    Ismail Rais, the representative of the Indonesian Islamic Trade Union, congratulated the conference and wished it to make conclusions that would be very beneficial to the workers' struggle and to the prosperity of society and the country. Referring to Indonesia's struggle to recover West Irian, he said, "For the peace of the world, especially the peace of the whole of Asia and Africa, I appeal to all brothers to hope that all workers in Asia and Africa will fully care about this issue."

    After Rais's speech, the representatives of the four trade union organizations in Indonesia who attended the conference jointly presented the conference with precious gifts such as the national emblem of Indonesia. Rais said that he hoped these gifts could become a symbol of the eternal friendship between the Indonesian and Chinese people. Tang Guifen, the executive chairman of the conference, expressed her gratitude for their gifts and said that Chinese workers and workers of all countries are supporting the heroic struggle of the Indonesian people to recover West Irian, and victory will belong to the Indonesian workers.

    Nai Babot Sukong, Secretary-General of the Free Workers Association of Thailand, and Nai Supachai Sisati, Secretary-General of the Thai Workers' Assembly, both emphasized the friendship between the Chinese and Thai people in their congratulatory messages to the conference today.

    Nai Babot Sukong said that the relationship between the Chinese and Thai nations has a history of thousands of years, but in a later period, this relationship was estranged due to political storms. The bloodlines of the Chinese and Thai nations are very close, and there is no difference in living habits. In Thailand, there has been a song popular for decades that Thai people, overseas Chinese, and children can sing, which begins with "The Chinese and Thai nations are not distant neighbors, but brothers." He believes that the relationship between the Chinese and Thai nations will become closer in the future. He said that the sky has begun to show dawn, and it will become brighter day by day.

    After Nai Babot Sukong's speech, he presented three books to the conference as a memento on behalf of the Free Labor Union of Thailand, one of which was the "Thai Trade Union Law" in Chinese and Thai. The executive chairman thanked him for his gifts on behalf of the conference.

    Nai Supachai Sisati said that the Thai working class and all peace-loving people in Thailand will overcome all difficulties and strive to establish close brotherly ties with the great Chinese people. They are extremely happy to see their relative-like neighbor progress and prosper, get rid of the oppression of imperialism, and become an economically and culturally independent and free country. Because the prosperity and progress of the peace-loving Chinese people will not only bring happiness to the Chinese people themselves but will also be the happiness and good example for all nations in the world, especially those Asian and African countries oppressed by US imperialism and its running dogs. He finally hoped that the great friendship between China and Thailand will develop into an eternal friendship. His passionate speech was warmly welcomed by the delegates.

    At the morning meeting, Zhang Ruiying (worker and advanced producer of Zhenxin Textile Factory in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province) also spoke.

    Finally, Gu Dachun, Deputy Secretary-General of the conference, read out the congratulatory telegrams sent to the conference by Nabahadur, Chairman of the All-Nepal Trade Union Congress, and Mahesh Prasad, Secretary-General. The telegram said, "We cannot send our representatives, we would like to extend our fraternal congratulations to the conference." (Attached picture)

　  工会代表同申决心
　　艰苦奋斗　勤俭建国 　 外宾致词呼吁保卫世界和平
    据新华社7日讯　中国工会第八次全国代表大会今天继续举行。六位代表和四位外宾在上午的会议上发言和致词。
    郗占元（全国总工会劳动保险部部长）代表就劳动保险工作发了言。他说，工会“七大”时实行劳动保险的职工人数为三百三十万人，到今年6月已达九百零九万人；国家每年用于劳动保险的经费也自1951年的三千三百二十七万元增加为1956年的一万六千五百七十四万元。另外工会举办的职工疗养事业和群众性的预防病伤的工作也有很大发展。但是目前劳动保险工作中还存在着不少缺点，需要进一步调整和克服。郗占元说，协助政府改进现行的劳动保险制度，是工会组织当前一项重要的工作。改进劳动保险制度要从我国实际情况出发，从六亿人口出发，从发展生产、巩固工农联盟和加强工人阶级的团结出发。
    林茂湘（郑州铁路管理局工会副主席）代表在发言中说，工会组织既要发动群众搞好生产，又要关心职工群众的生活。忽视群众的生活是不对的，但提出过高的要求也是不对的。我们工人阶级是领导阶级，应该对六亿人民负责。工会工作者，对群众的合理要求必须支持，帮助解决；对不合理的和一时办不到的要求，应该加强教育，用“二七”艰苦奋斗的精神，克服各种困难，搞好工作。
    锺民（上海市工会联合会主席）代表在介绍上海工厂开展整风运动的经验中提到，在整风中群众提出了许多意见，暴露出我们工会工作的缺点。这些缺点，我们都将在这次整风过程中依靠广大职工的监督和协助，大胆地、坚决地、彻底地加以改进。经过整改以后，我们的工会工作必将出现新的面貌。
      卜虹云（太原工会联合会主席）代表在发言中介绍了太原西山煤矿的整风情况。他说，事实证明，放手发动群众大鸣大放，不仅不会妨害生产，而且必然要掀起一个新的生产高潮。毫无疑义，全民整风将对我国工人运动发生深远的影响。
    孙国荣（天津市公共汽车公司工会主席）代表就基层工会组织如何贯彻整风生产两不误问题，发表了意见。他说，天津市公共汽车公司工会组织在整风开始后，在各车间都组织了临时的竞赛检查宣传组，经常检查竞赛开展情况和竞赛宣传工作。公司各级领导在整风运动中都注意了依靠群众开展群众性的技术活动，不断突破生产中的薄弱环节，因此有力地保证了生产。
    全印度尼西亚穆斯林工会代表苏达诺在贺词中说，由于在联合国范围内通过和平方式来争取西伊里安重新返回印度尼西亚共和国的怀抱的斗争已遭到挫折，因此，我请求你们的支援。现在工人和政府已采取了明确的态度，接管荷兰的企业。我们不是憎恨荷兰人，但我们憎恨荷兰帝国主义的政策。苏达诺还说，为了建设我们的国家，我们将向你们学习，我们将毫不犹疑地学习你们好的、有用的，而且符合于印度尼西亚的民族和国家特点的经验。
    印度尼西亚伊斯兰教工会代表伊斯梅尔·拉伊斯向大会致贺，并预祝大会能作出对工人斗争以及对社会和国家繁荣十分有益的结论。在谈到印度尼西亚收复西伊里安的斗争时，他说，为了世界的和平，特别是整个亚洲和非洲的和平，我向全体兄弟们呼吁，希望亚洲和非洲的全体工人充分关心这个问题。
    在拉伊斯致词后，出席这次大会的印度尼西亚四个工会组织的代表，共同向大会赠送了印度尼西亚国徽等珍贵的礼品，拉伊斯说，希望这些礼物能成为印度尼西亚人民和中国人民之间永恒友谊的象征。大会执行主席汤桂芬表示感谢他们的赠礼，并且说，中国工人和各国工人都在支援印度尼西亚人民收复西伊里安的英勇斗争，胜利将属于印度尼西亚工人。
    泰国自由工人协会总书记乃巴博·素空和泰国工人大会总书记乃素帕猜·西沙蒂今天向大会致贺词时，一致强调中泰两国人民友好。
    乃巴博·素空说，中泰两民族的关系已有上千年的历史，但在以后一个时期由于政治上的风暴，这种关系才疏远了。中泰两民族的血统很接近，生活习惯也没有什么差别。在泰国，几十年来流行着一首泰国人、华侨和小孩都会唱的歌，它的开头是“中泰两族并非远邻，而是亲兄弟。”他相信中泰两民族的关系今后将会更加密切。他说，天空已开始露出曙光，它将一天比一天更加明亮。
    乃巴博·素空致词后，代表泰国自由劳工联合会向大会赠送三本书作为纪念，其中有一本是中泰文对照的“泰国工会法”，执行主席代表大会感谢他的赠礼。
    乃素帕猜·西沙蒂说，泰国工人阶级和泰国一切爱好和平的人民将不顾一切困难，争取同伟大的中国人民建立兄弟般的紧密联系。他们万分高兴地看到亲戚般邻国进步和繁荣，摆脱帝国主义的压迫，成为一个经济上和文化上独立自由的国家。因为爱好和平的中国人民的繁荣和进步，不仅将给中国人民自己带来幸福，而且将是全世界各个民族，特别是那些被美帝国主义及其走狗压迫的亚非国家的幸福和好榜样。他最后希望中泰两国的伟大友谊将发展成为永恒的友谊。他的充满热情的讲话受到代表们的热烈欢迎。
    在上午的会议上，章瑞英（江苏省无锡市振新纺织厂工人、先进生产者）代表也发了言。
    最后，大会副秘书长顾大椿宣读了全尼泊尔工会大会主席纳巴哈都尔和总书记马赫士普拉撒德向大会拍来的贺电。贺电说，我们不能派出我们的代表，我们谨向大会致以兄弟般的祝贺。（附图片）
