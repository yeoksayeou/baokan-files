　　Friendship Everywhere
　　By Our Correspondent　Li Cheng
    "Geographically, the two brotherly countries of Bulgaria and China are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers. However, the ideology of Marxism-Leninism unites our two brothers. The friendship between us will not be severed by rivers and mountains, because this friendship is greater than the largest mountain in the world!..." This is what a representative of the residents of Ruse, Bulgaria, said when warmly welcoming the delegation of the National People's Congress of China at the beginning of this year. His name is Baris Merhmedov.
    This deep friendship, expressed in Merhmedov's enthusiastic words, which cannot be severed by thousands of rivers and mountains, is something that all Chinese people who come to Bulgaria can feel intimately. Although we have only been here for a few months, even just some of the smaller examples we have heard and seen are enough to show that the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people has blossomed with touching flowers everywhere.
    "Stay and eat, child!"
    In Bulgaria, Chinese people receive care and attention everywhere. For example, in small matters such as drinking water and eating, Chinese people are used to drinking boiled water and like to eat rice and porridge. However, people in Sofia never drink plain boiled water, and rice is only eaten as a dish. In order for Chinese students to be able to drink boiled water and eat rice and porridge, Sofia City Universities have specially allowed Chinese students to use electric stoves in their dormitories. When eating in the cafeteria, Bulgarian students often give the rice from their plates to Chinese students.
    Sometimes, Chinese comrades also receive care from Bulgarian people they don't even know. Liu Fuping, a Chinese student, once told us about an unforgettable thing he encountered.
    Last August, he was being treated in a hospital in Velingrad, a famous resort city in Bulgaria. One day, he was lying in bed resting when a Bulgarian old woman of about fifty years old suddenly came in. As soon as the old woman entered the door, she wanted to give him a packet of fragrant and sweet soft candy.
    Liu Fuping said: "Old Mama, thank you for your concern, but I am sick and the doctor won't let me eat candy."
    The old woman, with the loving smile of an elder caring for her children, said to him: "I have already asked the doctor, you can eat this kind of soft candy... Stay and eat, child!"
    This old woman had come to visit her little granddaughter who was being treated in the hospital. When she heard that there was a Chinese student in the hospital, she obtained the doctor's consent and gave Liu Fuping one of the two packets of soft candy she had brought for her little granddaughter.
    A reporter, and also a "doctor"
    The Bulgarian people are very concerned about the achievements of the Chinese people in all aspects. A Chinese person, no matter where you go, the people there will gather around you to talk to you kindly, asking this and that. They don't want to miss any opportunity to meet with Chinese people. One evening in July this year, we were already asleep in a hotel in Radomir County, Sofia Oblast. At around eleven o'clock, a Bulgarian comrade of about forty years old, disregarding the receptionist's dissuasion, insisted on talking to us. He said to us happily: "For a long time, I have wanted to see Chinese comrades and talk to them, and now I have finally seen you..."
    Usually, during our working hours at home, some Bulgarian comrades often come to us to inquire about things related to China. One morning, a tall man with a sickly face came to us and asked as soon as he entered the door: "Are you Chinese comrades? I heard that China has acupuncture treatment for diabetes, please introduce it to me, because I have this disease." This sudden and earnest request made us very embarrassed, because we do not understand medicine. We promised to try to help him. Afterwards, our translator said humorously: "Your task is not simple, you are reporters, and also 'doctors'!"
    Must learn to read "People's Daily"
    Many Bulgarian comrades can now say "Hello!" in Chinese. They are very interested in learning Chinese and ask to be taught as soon as they see Chinese comrades. They also ask how the Chinese character reform is progressing, hoping to see the reformed Chinese characters as soon as possible to facilitate learning. They say: "We really want to read the 'People's Daily' and learn more about China's socialist construction and the people's lives."
    In order to satisfy the Bulgarian comrades' desire to learn Chinese, Sofia University has specially opened a Chinese class. Some comrades who cannot leave their jobs take advantage of their vacation time to study. In April this year, a Bulgarian comrade who was learning Chinese on his own came to us and asked for help in learning Chinese. After we asked him to sit down, he picked up the People's Daily on the table and read: "Mao Zedong," "People's Republic of China," "Chinese People"... The translator told us: This comrade's name is Betko Betkov, and he works in the editorial department of the "Voice of the Fatherland" newspaper in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. He likes to study Chinese very much, and the main task of his annual vacation is to study Chinese. He can now recognize more than 300 characters. We gave him a copy of the "People's Daily," which he treasured and put in his pocket. When he left, he said with confidence: "I must learn to read the 'People's Daily'!"
    "Son" of Sino-Bulgarian friendship
    In some agricultural and herb experimental stations in Bulgaria, there are Chinese crops such as rice, cucumbers, tomatoes, ginseng, Schisandra chinensis, Angelica sinensis, and so on. Bulgarian comrades call them the "sons" of the close friendship between Bulgaria and China. This summer, we visited the comprehensive experimental station established by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences at the foot of the Rila Mountains. Among the more than 500 kinds of medicinal plants cultivated here, more than 190 are Chinese specialties. Stoyan Ilieva, a senior researcher at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences who had been to China, is specially responsible for cultivating ginseng here. She introduced us to the cultivation process of Chinese ginseng in Bulgaria. As early as the end of November 1953, Chinese ginseng seeds were sown on Bulgarian soil for the first time. However, due to lack of experience, some did not germinate, and the survival rate of those that did germinate was also very low. Therefore, in 1956, Comrade Ilieva went to China's ginseng-growing areas to conduct on-the-spot investigations and research. After returning to China, she improved the cultivation methods according to the Chinese ginseng cultivation methods and the specific conditions of the experimental station's soil and climate.
    Comrade Ilieva, who was tanned and strong by the sun, led us to visit the ginseng field. Here, under the arbor made of willow branches, more than 5,000 Chinese ginseng plants aged one to three years are growing vigorously. Comrade Ilieva squatted on the ground, carefully stroking the leaves and stems of the ginseng, and said to us excitedly: "Seeing them reminds me of the Chinese comrades and the Chinese farmers who grow ginseng, and reminds me of their enthusiastic help to us. They tirelessly introduced me to the ginseng cultivation methods, and also took the trouble to accompany me to climb mountains and ridges to observe wild ginseng... These ginseng are the 'sons' of the friendship between Bulgaria and China, and we must take special care of them."
    "Tell the Chinese people our hearts!"
    In the agricultural production cooperative named "Oriental Red" in Elin Pelin Village, Sofia Oblast, in the chemical factory named after Stalin in Dimitrovgrad City, in Kovachevtsi Village, Radomir County, Sofia Oblast, the hometown of Dimitrov, in the experimental station where Chinese ginseng and other herbs are cultivated, in all the places we have been, whenever we leave, the Bulgarian comrades there always hold our hands tightly and instruct us: "Please tell the Chinese people our hearts for the Chinese people."
    On August 28 this year, when the Chinese agricultural delegation headed by Liao Luyan, Minister of Agriculture of China, visited the Dimitrov Agricultural Production Cooperative in Skrazhdina Village, Lovech Province, a couple of members of the cooperative presented a portrait of Chairman Mao carefully embroidered by them to the delegation. They said to the members of the delegation: "Although our embroidery is not very good, this is a little bit of our heart to express our respect and love for the Chinese people and the leader of the Chinese people..."

　　处处是友情
　　本报记者　李成
    “在地理位置上，保中两个兄弟国家之间隔着千山万水。但是，马列主义思想把我们两个兄弟联合了起来。我们之间的友谊是不会被江水和山岭所隔断的，因为这种友谊比世界上最大的山岭还要大啊！……。”这是保加利亚鲁赛市一位居民代表在今年年初热情欢迎中国人民代表大会代表团时说的话。他的名字是巴里斯·默赫默多夫。
    默赫默多夫的热情话语所表达的这种万水千山隔不断的深厚情谊，凡是到保加利亚来的中国人都能亲切地感觉到。我们来到这里虽然不过数月，但是仅就耳闻目见的一些比较细小的事例就足够说明，中保两国人民的兄弟情谊到处开出了动人的花朵。
    “留下吃吧，孩子！”
    在保加利亚，中国人处处受到关怀和照顾。譬如喝水、吃饭这些小事吧，中国人习惯于喝开水，喜欢吃米饭、稀饭。但是，索非亚人从来不喝白开水，而米饭只是当菜吃。为了让中国留学生能喝到开水、吃点米饭和稀饭，索非亚市高等学校特别允许中国同学在宿舍使用电炉。在食堂吃饭时，保加利亚同学常常把菜盘子里的米饭送给中国同学吃。
    有时候，中国同志还承受着素不相识的保加利亚人的关心。中国留学生刘福平曾给我们讲过他所遇到的一件难忘的事情。
    去年8月，他在保加利亚有名的疗养地维林格勒城的一个医院里治病。一天，他正躺在床上休息，忽然进来一位五十来岁的保加利亚老妈妈。老妈妈一进门就要送给他一包又香又甜的软糖。
    刘福平说：“老妈妈，谢谢您的关心，我有病，医生不让吃糖。”
    老妈妈带着老人惯有的抚爱儿女的笑容对他说：“我已经问过医生了，这种软糖你可以吃……留下吃吧，孩子！”
    这位老妈妈是来探望她的在医院治病的小孙女的。当她听说医院里有一个中国学生时，就征得医生的同意，把带给小孙女吃的两包软糖分给刘福平一包。
    是记者，又是“医生”
    保加利亚人民非常关心中国人民在各方面取得的成就。一个中国人，无论你到哪里，那里的人们就会围拢来同你亲切地交谈，问这问那。他们不愿错过任何同中国人见面的机会。今年7月的一个晚上，我们在索非亚州拉达米尔县一家旅馆已经睡下了。十一时许，一个约四十来岁的保加利亚同志不顾招待员的劝阻，一定要同我们谈一谈。他兴高采烈地对我们说：“很长时间以来，我就想看一看中国同志，和他们谈一谈，现在终于看到你们了……。”
    平时，我们在家工作的时间，常常有些保加利亚同志来找我们，询问有关中国的事情。一天上午，一个面有病容的高个子来到我们这里，一进门就问：“你们是中国同志吧？听说中国有了医治糖尿病的针灸疗法，请给我介绍一下，因为我有这个病。”这一突然而来的恳切请求，令我们很为难，因为我们不懂医学。我们答应设法帮助他。事后，我们的翻译同志幽默地说：“你们的任务可不简单呀，是记者，又是‘医生！’”
    一定要学会看“人民日报”
    很多保加利亚同志现在都会用中国话说“您好！”他们对学习中国话很感兴趣，一见了中国同志就要求教。他们还询问中国文字改革工作进行得怎样了，希望能够早日看到改革后的中国文字，以便利学习。他们说：“我们很想看看‘人民日报’，多了解些中国的社会主义建设和人民生活的情况。”
    为了满足保加利亚同志学习中文的愿望，索非亚大学专门开设了一个中文班。一些离不开工作岗位的同志就利用休假时间学习。今年4月有一个自学中文的保加利亚同志来到我们这里，请求帮助他学习中文。我们请他坐下后，他顺手拿起桌上的人民日报就念：“毛泽东”、“中华人民共和国”、“中国人民”……。翻译同志告诉我们：这位同志名叫别特柯·别特柯夫，他在保加利亚普罗夫迪夫市“祖国之声”报社编辑部工作。他很喜欢研究中文，每年假期的主要任务就是学习中文，现在已经能认识三百多字了。我们送给他一份“人民日报”，他异常珍爱地装在衣袋里。临别时，满怀信心地说：“我一定要学会看‘人民日报’！”
    中保友谊的“儿子”
    在保加利亚的一些农业和药草实验站里，生长着中国的农作物稻米、黄瓜、西红柿、人参、五味子、当归等等。保加利亚同志把它们称作保中亲密友谊的“儿子”。今年夏天，我们参观了保加利亚科学院在里拉山下设立的综合实验站。这里培植的五百多种药用植物中，有一百九十多种是中国的特产。曾经到过中国的保加利亚科学院高级研究员斯托扬·伊丽耶娃同志，在这里专门负责培植人参的工作。她给我们介绍了中国人参在保加利亚的培植过程。早在1953年11月底，中国人参种籽就第一次播种在保加利亚的土地上。但由于经验不足，有的没有出苗，出了苗的成活率也很低。于是在1956年伊丽耶娃同志专门到中国培植人参的地区进行考察研究。回国后，按照中国栽培人参的方法和实验站的土壤、气候等具体条件，改进了培植的方法。
    被阳光晒得又黑又壮的伊丽耶娃同志带领我们参观了人参地。这里，在用柳树枝条编成的棚架下，茁壮地成长着五千多株一岁到三岁的中国人参。伊丽耶娃同志蹲在地上，小心地抚摸着人参的叶和茎，激动地对我们说：“看见它们，就想起了中国同志和栽培人参的中国农民，想起了他们热诚地帮助我们的情景。他们不厌其详地向我介绍人参的培植方法，还不辞劳苦地陪我翻山越岭去察看野参……。这些人参是保中两国友谊的‘儿子’，我们要特别爱护它们。”
    “把我们的心意告诉中国人民！”
    在索非亚州艾林彼林村以“东方红”命名的农业生产合作社里，在季米特洛夫格勒市以斯大林命名的化学工厂里，在季米特洛夫的故乡——索非亚州拉多米尔县科瓦切夫齐村里，在培植有中国人参和其他药草的实验站里，在所有我们到过的地方，每逢临别时，那里的保加利亚同志总是紧紧地握着我们的手，嘱咐我们：“请把我们对中国人民的心意告诉中国人民。”
    今年8月28日，以中国农业部廖鲁言部长为首的中国农业代表团在普列文州罗维县斯奇拉季纳村季米特洛夫农业生产合作社访问时，一对社员夫妇把他们精心绣成的毛主席像赠给代表团。他们对代表团团员们说：“虽然我们绣的不大好，可是这是我们对中国人民和中国人民领袖表示敬爱的一点心意……。”
