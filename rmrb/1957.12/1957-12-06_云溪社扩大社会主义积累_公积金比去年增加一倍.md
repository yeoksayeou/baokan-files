Xinhua News Agency Report: The Yunxi Agricultural Cooperative, located in the suburbs of Kunming and comprising over 1,600 member households, actively expanded socialist accumulation during the autumn harvest distribution. The public accumulation fund more than doubled compared to last year.

Yunxi Cooperative's agricultural and sideline production increased by 14% this year compared to last year. However, when initially discussing the proportion of public accumulation fund to retain, cooperative cadres generally overemphasized the immediate interests of the members, blindly emphasizing that increasing the public accumulation fund would reduce the income of the members. The members also felt that they had worked hard all year and advocated for retaining less and distributing more. Therefore, the initial plan for the public accumulation fund to be retained by Yunxi Cooperative was to maintain last year's level of 3% of the total income.

Under the leadership of the Party branch, all cadres and members of Yunxi Cooperative launched a debate on "Why Expand Public Accumulation?" Through the debate, the vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants reflected that, in the past when working individually, their labor power was no weaker than that of the wealthier peasants, but due to the lack of farm tools, draught animals, and funds, their production was not as good as others and their income was not as high as the wealthier peasants. If the cooperative wanted to increase production, it must have sufficient public accumulation. Cooperative cadres, after reviewing the various difficulties encountered in leading the development of production over the past two years since the establishment of the cooperative, also realized that insufficient public accumulation not only affected expanded reproduction but was also not beneficial to the long-term interests of the members.

After top-down and bottom-up discussions and detailed accounting, Yunxi Cooperative decided to retain 8% of the total income as a public accumulation fund this year. In this way, the income of each member household will still increase by an average of 16.12 yuan compared to last year.

    云溪社扩大社会主义积累
　　公积金比去年增加一倍
    据新华社讯　昆明市郊拥有一千六百多户社员的云溪农业社，在秋收分配中积极扩大社会主义积累，公积金比去年增加一倍多。
    云溪社今年农副业生产比去年增加一成四，可是开始讨论留公积金的比例时，社干部普遍过多考虑社员眼前利益，盲目强调多留公积金会减少社员收入；社员们也认为辛苦了一年主张少留多分。因此，云溪社最初计划留下的公积金，仍保持去年占总收入3％的水平。
    在党支部的领导下，云溪社全体干部和社员展开了“为什么要扩大公共积累”的辩论。经过辩论，广大贫农和下中农纷纷反映，过去单干时论劳动力不比富裕农民弱，而由于缺乏农具、耕畜和资金，生产比不上人家，收入没有富裕农民多。合作社要增产，也必需有足够的公共积累才行。社干部回顾了建社两年来在领导发展生产上所遇到的各种困难后，也认识到合作社公共积累过少不仅影响扩大再生产，对社员的长远利益也没有好处。
    经过自上而下和自下而上的讨论和算细账，云溪社决定今年在总收入中留出8％的公积金，这样，每户社员的收入仍比去年平均增加十六元一角二分。
