On the Anti-Rightist Front

    Literary Department Head Opposes the Party's Literary Line
    Huang Tie is the Planner of the Rightists' Attack on the Party

    This newspaper reports that the struggle against the Rightists in Yunnan Province's literary circles has achieved complete victory, and the original form of the rightist element Huang Tie within the Party has been thoroughly exposed.

    Huang Tie was the head of the Literary Department of the Propaganda Department of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, vice chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, a director of the Kunming Branch of the Chinese Writers Association, and once acted as the director of the Yunnan Provincial Culture Bureau. She was the planner, organizer, and supporter of the Rightists in Yunnan's literary circles in their attack on the Party. She and rightist elements Peng Jingfeng, Lan Mang, Yao Leng, and others have consistently implemented an anti-Party bourgeois literary line, rejecting the Party's leadership over literature and art, and engaging in activities to split Yunnan's literary circles. Huang Tie slandered the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for not being familiar with literature and art, and slandered Yunnan as being barbaric, uncultured, and backward. She and her accomplices attempted to use "frontier literature and art" as a tool to publicize their works and "achievements," and tried every means to oppose the instructions and policies of the Provincial Committee. Huang Tie said that "frontier literature and art" always clings to the Provincial Committee's policies, and that "there is a problem with the policies," and that she wanted to "turn it over." Last summer, when the Party put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," the Kunming Branch of the Writers Association organized a discussion on reflecting the frontier and excavating and sorting out national folk literature in order to implement the Party's policy. However, Huang Tie stood up to oppose it, slandering it as "taking someone as a target," as a negation of other works reflecting the frontier, and her accomplices Peng Jingfeng and others shouted together that the Kunming Branch of the Writers Association was engaged in "sectarianism," and launched a "general offensive" against military writers. This caused a great disturbance in literary circles. Huang Tie was also bent on becoming a king and hegemon in Yunnan's literary circles, attempting to put the Provincial Culture Bureau, the Kunming Branch of the Writers Association, and "frontier literature and art" all under her sole control. In June of last year, when the leadership decided that she should concentrate her efforts on the work of the Culture Bureau, she spread rumors behind her back, saying that she was "squeezed out" by the Writers Association branch, and that "the Writers Association must have someone who understands literature and art to be in charge," and so on. In November of last year, when the leadership transferred her back to the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Committee, she further felt that the Party was a serious obstacle to her dominating Yunnan's literary circles, and hated the Party even more. On the surface, she used the excuse that her illness had worsened and did not work, but secretly she actively engaged in sowing discord and splitting Yunnan's literary circles. She fabricated rumors that someone said many bad things about military writers in front of a certain person in charge of the Central Committee, attempting to further provoke the dissatisfaction of military writers with the Kunming Branch of the Writers Association and the Party's leadership. During the period of airing views, she actively encouraged and supported Peng Jingfeng, Yao Leng, Zhou Liangpei and others to leave Yunnan, attempting to let Yunnan's literary circles split and break up.

    During the period of great airing of views in Yunnan's literary circles this year, Huang Tie repeatedly incited rightist elements Peng Jingfeng and others to overturn the verdicts of the anti-rebellion campaign, and let them write letters to the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, attacking the cadres who were responsible for reviewing Peng Jingfeng's history during the anti-rebellion campaign. She said: "Don't you have opinions on him? This is the best time to write a letter." And personally went to the door to ask if the letter had been sent. When rightist elements such as Ou Xiaomu of the Kunming Branch of the Writers Association launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party, she said with great excitement that they "have character," and deeply thanked them for providing her with vivid creative materials, saying that these rightist elements will become historical figures in her future masterpiece.

    Huang Tie's path to anti-Party and anti-socialist was rooted in history. She considered herself a "meritorious official of the Party," a "veteran Party member of 1938," a "veteran cadre," and a "revolutionary descendant," and that the Party and the masses could not do anything to her. When studying the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party's Central Committee, everyone criticized her bourgeois tendency to seek fame and profit in her individualistic thinking, especially after criticizing her mistake of stealing the name of the organizer of the Naxi epic poem "Ashima," she became even more hostile to the Party, and maliciously slandered some leading cadres of the Provincial Committee who had criticized her as being "surrounded by counter-revolutionaries." During her tenure as acting director of the Provincial Culture Bureau, she used her position and power to create a personal force. She used the promise of official positions and promotions to win over people she liked; she appointed three deputy directors of the Provincial Culture Bureau in Yunnan Province alone.

    Huang Tie originally had no writing talent, and had never written anything that could be called a "work," but she flaunted herself as an "old writer," promoting "one bookism," and "said that engaging in creation is one's own." She often gave others topics, asking others to collect materials or write on her behalf, but the signature and royalties were hers. She had no works of her own, so she stole the fruits of other people's labor in organizing "Ashima," and shamelessly competed with others for royalties.

### 文艺处长反对党的文艺方针  黄铁是右派进攻党的策划人

    文艺处长反对党的文艺方针
    黄铁是右派进攻党的策划人
    本报讯　云南省文艺界反击右派斗争获得全胜，党内右派分子黄铁的原形被彻底揭露。
    黄铁是中共云南省委宣传部文艺处处长，云南省文联副主席，中国作家协会昆明分会理事，并曾一度代理云南省文化局局长。她是云南省文艺界右派分子向党进攻的策划人、组织者和支持者。她和右派分子彭荆风、蓝芒、姚冷等一直共同执行着一条反党的资产阶级文艺路线，拒绝党对文艺的领导，进行分裂云南文艺界的活动。黄铁诬蔑中共云南省委不熟悉文艺，诬蔑云南野蛮、没文化、落后。她和她的同伙们企图把“边疆文艺”作为宣传她（他）们作品和“功绩”的工具，千方百计地反对省委的指示和方针。黄铁说：“边疆文艺”老是抓住省委的方针不放，“方针有问题”，她要“把它翻过来”。去年夏天，当党提出“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针以后，作协昆明分会为了贯彻党的这个方针，组织了关于反映边疆和发掘整理民族民间文学的讨论，但是黄铁却起来反对，她诬蔑这是拿某人“开刀”，是对其他反映边疆作品的否定，她的同伙彭荆风等人也一齐大叫作协昆明分会搞“宗派主义”，向部队作家“总进攻”。在文艺界曾掀起了很大的风波。黄铁还一心要在云南文艺界称王称霸，企图把省文化局、作协昆明分会和“边疆文艺”都放在她的独揽之下。去年6月，领导决定她集中精力作文化局工作时，她在背后散布流言蜚语，说她是被作协分会“排挤出来”，“作协得有一个懂文艺的人去坐镇才行”等等。去年11月，领导调她回省委宣传部工作时，她进一步感到党是她独霸云南文艺界的严重阻碍，对党更加仇恨。她表面上借口病情加重，不做工作，暗地里却积极进行挑拨离间，分裂云南文艺界。她造谣某人在中央某负责人面前说部队作家许多坏话，企图进一步挑起部队作家对作协昆明分会和党的领导的不满。并在鸣放期间积极鼓动和支持彭荆风、姚冷、周良沛等人离开云南，企图让云南文艺界分裂、散伙。
    在今年云南文艺界大鸣大放的时候，黄铁曾几次煽动右派分子彭荆风等人翻肃反的案，让他们给解放军总政治部写信，攻击肃反时负责审查彭荆风历史的干部。她说：“你们不是对他有意见吗？趁这个机会写信最好了。”而且亲自登门追问信发走了没有。当作协昆明分会右派分子欧小牧等向共产党猖狂进攻的时候，她却眉飞色舞说“是有性格的”，并深深地感激他们为她提供了生动的创作资料，说这些右派分子将成为她未来巨著中的历史人物。
    黄铁所以走上了反党反社会主义的道路，是有其历史根源的。她自以为是“党的功臣”，“三八年的老党员”，“老干部”，“革命后代”，党和群众不能把她怎样。当学习党的四中全会文件时，大家批评了她的资产阶级好名好利的个人主义思想，尤其是批评了她窃取纳西文长诗“阿诗玛”的整理者之名的错误后，她反而更加仇视党，并恶意污蔑省委一些批评过她的领导干部是“被反革命包围”。在她担任省文化局代理局长期间，利用职权，制造个人势力。她喜欢的人，就用封官许愿来拉拢，只云南省的文化局副局长她就封了三个。
    黄铁本来没有写作的才能，而且也没有写出过什么称得上“作品”的东西，但她俨然以“老作家”的姿态招摇撞骗，宣传“一本书主义”，“说搞创作才是自己的。”她常常给别人出题目，要别人为她搜集材料或执笔，而署名、稿费却是她的。她自己没有作品，就窃取别人整理“阿诗玛”的劳动成果，还无耻的同别人争夺稿费。
