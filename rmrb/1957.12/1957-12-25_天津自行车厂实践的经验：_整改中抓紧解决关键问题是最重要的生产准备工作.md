    Tianjin Bicycle Factory's Practical Experience:
    Grasping the Solution of Key Problems During Rectification is the Most Important Production Preparation Work
    (Our report) According to the Tianjin Daily, after achieving certain results in general rectification, the leadership of the Tianjin Bicycle Factory earnestly mobilized the masses to launch special contention and blooming, directing the spearhead of rectification towards production management. Currently, four of the ten key issues related to the entire factory have been resolved, creating favorable conditions for completing the task of significantly increasing bicycle production next year.
    As of November, this factory had already processed 65.5% of the more than 13,000 opinions raised by employees. At the beginning of December, this factory mobilized the masses to conduct special contention and blooming around key issues in production management. In the first two days, employees posted more than 1,000 big-character posters criticizing the chaotic phenomena in production management. After analyzing the opinions of the masses, the leadership determined two key areas in production that needed to be resolved throughout the factory: one was to improve the quality of semi-finished products, and the other was to adjust the work locations of production workshops.
    More than a dozen leading cadres, engineers, etc. from the factory's Party, government, labor union, and youth league organizations went deep into the workshops to help with the work. Workshop leaders also relied on veteran workers to mobilize all employees to study and solve these two key problems. When the factory director participated in a contention and blooming meeting of the Second Workshop, veteran worker Liu Enfu criticized, "Our mold repair team repairs molds well, but because there is no punch press to test them, many defective products are created. We have raised this issue many times, but the leadership has not resolved it." The factory director immediately criticized his mistake of not paying attention to the opinions of the masses and decided to transfer two punch presses to the mold repair team. The space for this group was very narrow and could not accommodate the punch presses. The factory director immediately had the workshop office moved to another location, expanding the space for the mold repair team. The workers said, "Rectification is really effective, and the problems we raised are quickly resolved."
    Due to the leading cadres personally taking action to solve problems in a timely manner, the enthusiasm of all employees in the factory was high, and the rectification work progressed rapidly. The two key areas of this factory were broken down into ten specific issues in each workshop, and four of them have now been basically resolved. For example, the nuts on the bicycle spokes produced by the Third Workshop had a high scrap rate, and the plan could not be completed for several years. The Third Workshop held a special rectification meeting, adopted the suggestion of veteran worker Chen Guishan, and improved the machines, which greatly reduced the scrap rate and increased production by nearly double, enough for the entire factory to assemble bicycles. The workers in the mold stamping section of the Second Workshop reworked all of the more than four tons of substandard products that had been accumulated, and also used holidays to clean all of the more than thirty machines that had not been cleaned for more than a year. In addition, the leadership strengthened the inspection work and implemented a system of responsibility for returns and repairs. Since December, the return and repair rate in this section has decreased by more than 3%.
    The leaders of this factory believe that the current special rectification focusing on solving production management problems has a significant effect on completing the heavy production tasks next year and is the most important production preparation work. This work must continue to be done well.

### 天津自行车厂实践的经验：  整改中抓紧解决关键问题是最重要的生产准备工作

    天津自行车厂实践的经验：
    整改中抓紧解决关键问题是最重要的生产准备工作
    本报讯　据天津日报报道：天津自行车厂领导方面在一般整改有一定成绩以后，认真发动群众展开专题鸣放，把整改的矛头指向生产管理工作。目前有关全厂关键的十大问题已经解决了四个，为完成明年大量增产自行车的任务创造了有利条件。
    这个厂在11月份已经把职工提出的一万三千多条意见处理了65.5％。12月初，这个厂发动群众围绕生产管理上的关键问题进行专题鸣放。头两天，职工们就贴出了一千多张大字报，批评生产管理中的混乱现象。领导方面分析了群众的意见，确定全厂生产上要解决的两大关键：一个是提高半成品质量，一个是调整生产车间的工作地。
    这个厂的党、政、工、团领导干部和工程师等十几个人，分别深入车间帮助工作，车间领导也依靠老工人，发动全体职工研究解决这两个关键问题。这个厂的厂长参加二车间工人鸣放会时，老工人刘恩甫批评说：“我们修具组修好模具，因为没有冲床来试验，造成了不少废品。我们提了多少次意见，领导上也不给解决。”厂长当场检讨了自己不重视群众意见的错误，并且决定调两台冲床给修具组。这个组的地方很窄，安不下冲床，厂长又马上让车间办公室搬到另外的地方，扩大了修具组的地方。工人们说：“整改就顶事，我们提出的问题很快就解决了。”
    由于领导干部亲自动手及时解决问题，全厂职工热情高涨，整改工作进展很快。这个厂的两大关键具体到各车间共是十大问题，目前有四个已经基本解决。如三车间生产的自行车辐条上的螺丝母，因为报废率大，几年来完不成计划，三车间召开了专题整改会议，采纳了老工人陈桂山的建议，改进机器，使报废率大大减少，产量提高了近一倍，足够全厂装配自行车使用。二车间冲模工段工人把积压的次品四吨多全部返修好了，还利用假日把一年多没有擦过的三十多台机器全部擦光。加上领导方面加强了检验工作，实行了退修负责制度，12月份以来这个工段的退修率已经下降了3％以上。
    这个厂的领导人员认为，当前解决生产管理问题的专题整改，对于完成明年繁重的生产任务具有重大作用，是最重要的生产准备工作，一定要继续做好这一工作。
