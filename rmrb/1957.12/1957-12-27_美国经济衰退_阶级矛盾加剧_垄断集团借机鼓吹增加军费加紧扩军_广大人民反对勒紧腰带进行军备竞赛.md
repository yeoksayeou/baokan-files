Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 26th: As the American economic recession develops, there is much discussion in the United States about how to find a way out.

The solution proposed by the monopoly capital groups, who reap huge profits from war preparations and overseas expansion, is to greatly increase military spending. The US government is, in fact, already doing this.

These monopoly groups, who advocate accelerating the nuclear arms race, currently have great influence in American political circles. In this year's reorganization of the US government, their influence in the government has further increased. McElroy, who replaced Wilson, who advocated cutting some military spending, as Secretary of Defense, proposed a missile development program that required huge expenditures as soon as he took office. At the same time, Anderson, a major capitalist engaged in oil exploitation and other strategic materials, replaced Humphrey, who advocated shrinking the budget, as Secretary of the Treasury.

Senator Johnson, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee and Democratic leader, openly advocated that the "only way out" for the United States to get rid of its economic difficulties is to expand military production and produce the latest weapons on a large scale.

The US government has now indicated that it will increase military spending by $1 billion in the current fiscal year and nearly $3 billion in the next.

Some American arms industry entrepreneurs are already openly applauding the increase in military spending. Seckert, vice chairman of the American Electronics Industry, said at a discussion held by the US Chamber of Commerce, a major capitalist organization in the United States on December 15, that the current focus on producing rockets and increasing military spending in the national budget has brought "gratifying achievements" to the electronics industry. General Hull, chairman of the Chemical Manufacturers Association and a retired general, also "optimistically" predicted in his report that the American chemical industry also hopes to increase military orders.

In the United States, some capitalists who have less connection with the military industry are not very interested in the arms race. They demand to cope with the situation by relaxing interest rates and increasing government civilian spending. Commer, a senior economist at the National Planning Association, recently asked the US government to immediately relax credit restrictions and promote urgently needed "non-defensive programs." Some business representatives also made similar requests at a symposium hosted by the US Chamber of Commerce. At present, some members of Congress, considering the mood of voters in next year's congressional elections, are also opposed to a large increase in military spending.

The broad masses of the American people have fundamentally different opinions on the way forward. They oppose the arms merchants' crazy arms race policy of asking people to "tighten their belts," and they also disagree with the policy of simply relying on relaxing interest rates and expanding credit. They believe that relaxing interest rates is only a policy to stimulate increased investment by large enterprises. Under the influence of the broad masses of workers, the AFL-CIO's proposal is to require changes in tax policies to reduce the burden on most middle- and low-income families; increase wages; and expand health, welfare, and unemployment relief programs to increase workers' purchasing power, etc.

    美国经济衰退　阶级矛盾加剧
    垄断集团借机鼓吹增加军费加紧扩军
    广大人民反对勒紧腰带进行军备竞赛
    据新华社26日讯　纽约消息：随着美国经济衰退的发展，美国国内正在议论纷纷：怎样才能找到出路？
    从备战和海外扩张中获得庞大利润的垄断资本集团提出的方案是：大大增加军费。美国政府事实上已正在照这样做。
    这些主张加紧核军备竞赛的垄断集团，目前在美国政界有很大的势力。在今年美国政府的改组中，他们在政府中的势力又有进一步增长。接替主张削减某些军费开支的威尔逊担任国防部长的是麦克艾罗伊，他在一上任之后就提出了需要庞大费用的发展导弹计划。同时，经营石油开采和其他战略物资的大资本家安德逊代替了主张收缩预算的汉弗来，担任财政部长。
    美国参议院军备小组委员会主席、民主党领袖约翰逊公开鼓吹，美国摆脱经济困难的“唯一出路”是扩大军事生产，大规模生产最新式的武器。
    现在美国政府已经表示要在本财政年度增加军费十亿美元，下一年度增加近三十亿美元。
    对于军费开支的增加，有些美国军火企业家已经在公开拍手叫好。美国电子工业副主席西克里特12月15日在美国的大资本家组织——美国商会举办的一次讨论会上说，目前侧重的生产火箭和增加国家预算中的军事开支，已经使电子工业获得了“可喜的成就”。化学制造商协会主席、退休将军赫尔在他的报告中也“乐观地”预测，美国化学工业也有希望增加军事定货。
    在美国，有一些同军事工业关系较少的资本家对军备竞赛兴趣不大，他们要求用放宽利率和增加政府民用开支来应付局面。“美国全国计划协会”高级经济学家科姆最近要求美国政府立即放宽信贷限制，以及促进迫切需要的“非防御性计划”。一些企业代表在美国商会主持的座谈会上也提出了类似要求。目前，还有一些国会议员考虑到明年国会选举中的选民情绪，也在反对大量增加军费开支。
    美国广大人民对于今后出路有着同上述种种根本不同的意见。他们反对军火商人要人民“勒紧腰带”的疯狂军备竞赛政策，也不同意单纯依赖放宽利率、扩大信贷的政策。他们认为放宽利率只是一种刺激增加大企业投资的政策。在广大工人群众的影响下，美国劳联—产联提出的建议是：要求修改税收政策，来减轻大多数中等收入者和低收入者的家庭负担；增加工资，扩大卫生、福利和失业救济计划来提高工人的购买力水平等等。
