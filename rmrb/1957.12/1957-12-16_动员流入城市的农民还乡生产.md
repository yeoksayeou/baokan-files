Mobilizing Farmers Who Have Flowed into Cities to Return to Their Hometowns for Production
By our reporter Zhong Lin
　　In the past few years, Tianjin has twice mobilized farmers who flowed into the city to return to their hometowns for production; however, the phenomenon of farmers flowing in continues to increase. According to a survey by the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, from 1956 to October 1957, a total of more than 205,000 agricultural people flowed into Tianjin. Among them, more than 100,000 were rural women. Most of them originally participated in agricultural production, but after flowing into the city, they mainly relied on cadres, workers, and handicraft cooperative members to support them, becoming consumers. Only more than 1,700 people became nannies. More than 74,000 were elderly, weak, or young people under the age of eighteen who were relying on relatives or friends or had nowhere to turn. Among the remaining nearly 30,000 people, more than 12,000 were working as temporary laborers, more than 8,000 became permanent workers, more than 4,000 were unlicensed peddlers, and more than 3,000 had no proper jobs and were called "dabachas."

　　Why are so many people flowing into the city? There are many reasons. Only a few came because of disasters. The vast majority came because they were not content with agricultural production and admired city life. From the perspective of work in the city, the wages and benefits of ordinary workers, odd-job workers, and apprentices are too high. In the past, employees whose families were in the countryside did not have vacation time to visit their families. Industrial and commercial enterprises, farms, and handicrafts enterprises hired workers from the countryside without authorization. Lax household registration management, lax management of unlicensed peddlers, and overly generous food supplies all affected the flow of agricultural people into the city.

　　So many agricultural people flowing into the city is not only detrimental to agricultural production, but also increases many difficulties in urban work, making the supply of food, non-staple food, and other materials in the city more strained, and the city's housing, transportation, and public places more crowded. Those who work as unlicensed peddlers and "dabachas" affect public order in the city. This is very detrimental to the country's socialist construction.

　　Now, the Party Central Committee has issued a call to go down to the countryside and up to the mountains, a large number of cadres in the city are being transferred to the countryside to participate in production, and many family members of military officers are also returning to their hometowns to participate in production. The countryside is discussing the forty articles of the program for developing agriculture and formulating plans for developing agricultural production. A huge upsurge in agricultural production is about to arrive. The state has also put forward regulations on vacation time for employees to visit their families, and the wage treatment of ordinary workers and apprentices has also reached reasonable standards. … These will not only have a huge effect on preventing farmers from continuing to flow into cities in large numbers, but also provide favorable conditions for mobilizing farmers who have flowed into cities to return to their hometowns for production. At the same time, organs, enterprises, handicraft cooperatives and neighborhoods in cities, as well as the countryside, are or will be carrying out rectification and socialist education campaigns without exception. If, during the movement, under leadership, through debate, the erroneous ideas of those farmers who flowed into the city who are not content with agricultural production, and the erroneous ideas of those who support farmers flowing into the city, are criticized and educated, so that they recognize the superiority of agricultural cooperativization, recognize the prospects and current tasks of the new socialist countryside, and help them establish the idea of building a new socialist countryside and the idea of vigorously supporting agricultural production, it will greatly facilitate the mobilization of farmers who flowed into the city to return to their hometowns for production. After relevant cadres, workers, handicraft cooperative members and other residents in the city have a correct understanding, they will also be happy to mobilize their family members or relatives and friends who came from the countryside to return to their hometowns for production.

　　Of course, to mobilize such a large number of farmers who have flowed into the city to return to their hometowns for production, it is still necessary to carry out many specific organizational and educational tasks. These tasks require the unified leadership of the Party committee, as well as the organic cooperation of various organs, enterprises, cooperatives, and neighborhoods, and especially the cooperation of the Party and government organizations and agricultural cooperatives in the countryside, to be carried out well. These tasks should be started immediately.

　　Now, the leading organs of Tianjin are considering taking a series of measures to mobilize all the farmers who flowed into Tianjin who can return to their hometowns for production to return. It is hoped that other cities will not miss the current favorable opportunity.

### 动员流入城市的农民还乡生产

　　动员流入城市的农民还乡生产
　　本报记者　锺林
    前几年，天津市曾经两次动员过流入城市的农民还乡生产；但是，农民流入的现象仍在继续增加。据天津市公安局的调查，从1956年到1957年10月，流入天津市的农业人口共有二十万五千多人。其中，有十万多人是农村妇女，她们中大多数原来是参加农业生产的，流入城市后却主要是依靠干部、职工和手工业合作社社员养活，变成为消费人口；只有一千七百多人是当了保姆。有七万四千多人是投亲靠友或无处投靠的老弱或十八岁以下的幼少年人。其余的近三万人中，有一万二千多是作临时工，有八千多当了固定工人，有四千多是无执照的摊商小贩，有三千多没正当事干，被称为“打八岔”的。
    为什么有这样多人流入城市呢？原因很多。因为受灾逃难来的只是少数。绝大多数是不安心于农业生产，羡慕城市生活而来的。从城市方面的工作上来看，普通工、勤杂工和学徒的工资和福利偏高，过去对家在农村的职工没有回家探亲的假期，工商企业、农场和手工业擅自到农村招雇工人。对户口管理不严，对无照摊商小贩管理不严，粮食供应偏宽，等等，都影响了农业人口流入城市。
    这么多的农业人口流入城市，不仅对农业生产不利，而且增加了城市工作的许多困难，使得城市的粮食、副食品和其他若干物资的供应更加紧张，城市的房屋、交通工具和公共场所更加拥挤，而那些作无照摊商和小贩的，以及“打八岔”的，更影响了城市的公共秩序。这对于国家的社会主义建设是很不利的。
    现在，党中央提出了下乡上山的号召，城市里大批干部下放到农村参加生产，许多军官家属也纷纷还乡生产，农村里正在讨论发展农业的四十条纲要和制定发展农业生产的规划，一个巨大农业生产高潮就要到来了，国家也提出了职工回家探亲的假期的规定，普通工勤杂工和学徒的工资待遇也有了合理的标准，……。这些，不仅对于制止农民继续大量流入城市将发生巨大的作用，而且也是动员流入城市的农民还乡生产的有利条件。同时，城市的机关、企业、手工业合作社和街道，以及农村里，都正在或将要毫无例外地进行整风和开展社会主义教育运动，如果在运动中，有领导地经过辩论，对那些流入城市的农民的不安心于农业生产的错误思想，对支持农民流入城市的人的错误思想，给予批评教育，使他们认识农业合作化的优越性，认识社会主义的新农村的远景和当前的任务，帮助他们树立建设社会主义的新农村的思想和大力支援农业生产的思想，是会大大便利于动员流入城市的农民还乡生产的。而城市中有关的干部、职工、手工业社社员和其他居民们，在有了正确的认识以后，也会乐意把他们的从农村来的家属或亲友动员还乡生产的。
    当然，要动员这样大量的流入城市的农民还乡生产，是还需要进行许多具体的组织和教育工作的。这些工作需要党委的统一领导，也需要各机关、企业、合作社和街道的有机配合，尤其需要农村的党、政组织和农业社的配合，才能进行得好。而这些工作是应该立即着手进行的。
    现在，天津市的领导机关正在考虑采取一系列的措施，准备把流入天津市的可以还乡生产的农民都动员回去。希望其他的城市，也不要错过当前的良好时机。
