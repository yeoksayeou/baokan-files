除四害前线: Frontline of Eliminating the Four Pests

    Yang Heng'an, Rat-Catching Expert
    Yang Heng'an, a worker at the Qiyuan Teahouse in Nanjing, has caught more than 1,300 rats with rat traps in more than five months. The masses have elected him as a first-class pest elimination expert in Nanjing. Yang Heng'an first studied the living habits of rats and knew that after the house rats came out of their holes, they would run around indoors in the warm spring and run along the base of the walls after the cool autumn. He also observed the range of activities and whereabouts of the rats, and placed rat traps with fragrant bait about two feet away from the rat holes. He washed the traps that had caught rats with alkaline water to remove the fishy smell. Over the past few months, he has placed thirty-eight rat traps in residents' homes and caught many rats every day, catching as many as twenty-seven in one day.

    捕鼠能手杨恒安
    南京市棋园茶社工人杨恒安五个多月来用鼠夹捕鼠一千三百多只，群众选他为南京市一等除害能手。杨恒安事先研究了老鼠的生活习性，知道家鼠出洞后，春暖时节是在屋内混窜，秋凉后就靠墙脚跑。他又观察老鼠的活动范围和来踪去迹，把安放着有香味食饵的鼠夹放在距鼠洞约二尺远的地方，打过老鼠的夹子都用碱水烫洗干净，去掉腥味。几个月来，他把三十八只鼠夹分别安放在居民家里，每天都捕到好些老鼠，最多的一天捕到二十七只。
