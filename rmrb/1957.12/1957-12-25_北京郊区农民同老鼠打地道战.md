Farmers in the Dongfang Agricultural Production Cooperative, Shahe Township, Changping District, Beijing, recently waged an "underground warfare" against rats, killing 429 field mice and digging out more than 3,740 catties of grain. The grain taken into the burrows by the rats included corn, small red beans, black beans, and edamame. Except for a very small portion that had rotted, the grain was good and enough to feed ten average adults for a year.

On the 20th, Liu Changan, Yuan De'er, and Xu Yongsheng, members of the cooperative, discovered a rat hole and immediately began digging along the entrance. After digging one foot, the tunnel split into two, leading to the rat nest and the agricultural cooperative's grain storage area, respectively. When they opened all the rat burrows, they found various grains spread throughout the winding tunnels, which were more than a丈 long.

In the past week, Liu Changan and the other two, using their spare time from farming, dug out more than 670 catties of grain from the rat holes and killed more than 50 field mice. Based on their experience, many members of the cooperative launched an activity of "waging underground warfare against rats." They not only achieved significant "victories" but also recognized the harmfulness of rats. (Xinhua News Agency)

    北京郊区农民同老鼠打地道战
    北京市昌平区沙河乡东方农业生产合作社三十七户农民最近同老鼠打了一场“地道战”，打死田鼠四百二十九只，挖出粮食三千七百四十多斤。这些被老鼠衔进洞去的粮食有玉米、小豆、黑豆、毛豆等，除极少一部分已霉烂外，都是好粮，够十个普通成年人吃一年。
    这个社的社员刘长安、袁德尔、徐永生在20日发现了一个鼠洞，立即循着洞口掘进。掘土一尺后穴道即分为两条，分别通向老鼠窝和农业社储藏粮食的地方。当他们把全部鼠穴打开后，发现在一丈多长的弯弯曲曲的穴道里铺满了各种粮食。
    刘长安等三人在过去一周中，利用农闲的时间，从鼠洞中共挖出六百七十多斤粮食，打死了五十多只田鼠。根据他们的经验，这个社的许多社员展开了“同老鼠打地道战”的活动。他们不仅因此获得了重大的“战果”，还认清了老鼠的危害性。　　　（新华社）
