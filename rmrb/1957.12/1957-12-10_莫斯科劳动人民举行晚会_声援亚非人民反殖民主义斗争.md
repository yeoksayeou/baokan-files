　　Representing the working people of Moscow were representatives from all walks of life, prominent figures from scientific and cultural circles, and leaders from mass political organizations and social groups.

　　Academician Mitin, Chairman of the Board of the All-Union Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge, delivered the opening address. He said that the purpose of holding this evening party is to express our brotherly support for the people of Asian and African countries who are fighting for their national independence and against colonialism, and to express our support for the people who aspire to a new and free life.

The countries of the socialist camp and all people of goodwill support the noble cause of the Asian and African people in their struggle for freedom, independence, and peace. We Soviets deeply sympathize with the liberation struggles of the people in colonial and dependent countries. Our Soviet state is a faithful and long-tested friend of the people of these countries.

In his speech, he mentioned the great support that Egypt received from the people of the world last year in its struggle against the aggressors, as well as the significant role that the Bandung Conference played in the development of international politics.
