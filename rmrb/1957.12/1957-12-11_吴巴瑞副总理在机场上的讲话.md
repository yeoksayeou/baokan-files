Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe's Speech at the Airport

Dear and respected Premier Zhou Enlai and dear friends:

We are very pleased and express our heartfelt thanks to all of you for taking the trouble to welcome us in this cold season. Although the weather is very cold, the warm welcome from all of you, especially Premier Zhou Enlai's personal presence, makes us feel very warm.

My wife and I are visiting China at the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China. Although Premier Zhou Enlai's invitation was extended a long time ago, it has not been possible to make the trip due to various reasons. Only now do we have the opportunity to fulfill our promise to visit China. Therefore, we are very happy.

We have come to China without any special mission. We have brought with us the friendship and deep feelings of the Burmese people.

People who have visited China in the past, including our Prime Minister U Nu, have brought back to us the warm friendship expressed by Chinese leaders and the Chinese people towards Burma. Both of our countries have jointly transitioned from the unfortunate old fate of the past into a new era. Therefore, the relationship between our two nations has become even closer.

The leaders of our two countries have taken a long-term perspective to achieve mutual understanding, thereby further consolidating the Sino-Burmese friendly relations that have existed since ancient times.

Now, please allow me to address all the Chinese people, who are as close as brothers, with the Burmese word "Pauk Phaw"!

I wish the "Pauk Phaw" good health!

Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!

May the people of China and Burma join hands to defend peace in Asia and the world.

　　吴巴瑞副总理在机场上的讲话亲爱的、尊敬的周恩来总理和诸位亲爱的朋友们：
    在这样寒冷的季节里，诸位不辞辛苦，前来欢迎我们，我们感到非常高兴，并表示衷心的感谢。虽然气候非常寒冷，但是由于诸位的热烈欢迎，特别是周恩来总理亲自前来欢迎我们，使我们感到非常温暖。
    我和我的夫人是应中华人民共和国周恩来总理的邀请而来访问中国的。虽然周恩来总理的邀请是在很早以前的事，但是由于种种原因，始终未能成行，一直到现在我们才有机会实现我们答应访问中国的诺言。因此感到非常高兴。
    我们到中国来，并没有什么特殊的任务。我们这次带来了缅甸人民的友谊和深厚的感情。
    过去曾经访问过中国的人士，包括我们的总理吴努在内，都给我们带来了中国领袖和中国人民对缅甸所表示的亲切友情。我们两国都是从过去不幸的旧命运里共同转入了新的时代。因此，我们两个民族之间的关系也就更加亲密起来了。
    我们两个国家的领导人，都以长远的眼光，来取得相互间的谅解，从而进一步巩固了自古以来就已存在的中缅友好关系。
    现在请允许我以缅甸话“胞波”来称呼像同胞兄弟一样亲密的一切中国人民吧！
    祝“胞波”们健康！
    中缅友好万岁！
    愿中缅两国人民携起手来，保卫亚洲与世界和平。
