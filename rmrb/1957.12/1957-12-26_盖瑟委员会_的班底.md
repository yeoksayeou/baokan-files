The American "Gaither Committee," acting on orders from the President's office, drafted a wildly expansionist "top secret report" advocating a "preemptive" war.

Who made up the "Gaither Committee"? The chairman of this organization was Gaither, a San Francisco lawyer and former chairman of the Ford Foundation Committee, which possessed $2.7 billion and engaged in worldwide "charity" activities. There were ten members, all tycoons, politicians, and highly respected retired generals. The committee also had an "advisory panel" of eleven people, a "supporting advisory panel" of five, and committee "assistants," making it an extremely large organization.

Let's look at the representatives of the big financial groups on this committee. There was McLoy, representing the Chase Manhattan Bank, belonging to the Kuhn-Loeb consortium; Fiske, Keeler, and Prime, representing Bell Telephone Laboratories of the Morgan consortium. There was also Webster, representing New England Electric Company; Sprague, manager of Sprague Electric Company; Coulson, representing McKinsey & Company; Perkins, representing the Carnegie Corporation, and so on.

Figures who held senior positions in large enterprises after retirement included: Lovett, former Secretary of Defense and now with Brown Brothers Harriman Bank; Foster, former Deputy Secretary of Defense and now with Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation; Admiral Carney, former Chief of Naval Operations and now with Westinghouse Electric Corporation, belonging to the Mellon consortium; Doolittle, the U.S. Air Force general who first bombed Tokyo in World War II and now with Shell Oil Company; and Hull, former Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Command and Commander of the "United Nations Forces" invading Korea, and now President of the Manufacturing Chemists' Association.

Holding important positions in the government and scientific and technological circles were: Rabi, Chairman of the President's Science Advisory Committee; Killian and Wiesner, Presidential Advisors on Science and Technology and professors at MIT; Lawrence of the University of California Radiation Laboratory; and Nitze, former Director of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff, now working at the University of Washington.

Holding important positions in military research institutions were: Lincoln of the U.S. Military Academy, and General McCormick, Director, and Hill, Deputy Director, of the Institute for Defense Analyses. In addition, there were representatives from the press, such as Stanton, manager of CBS.

From these figures and their backgrounds, it can be seen how the American big financial groups, regardless of the bankruptcy of the "strength" policy, are still enthusiastic about arms expansion and war preparation, and those retired warmongering generals have not laid down their butcher knives just because they have taken off their military uniforms.

    “盖瑟委员会”的班底
    美国“盖瑟委员会”根据总统府的命令草拟了疯狂扩军的“绝密报告”，鼓吹发动“先发制人”的战争。
    “盖瑟委员会”是些什么人组成的？拥有二十七亿美元、从事世界范围的“慈善”活动的以前福特基金委员会的主席、旧金山的律师盖瑟，是这个组织的主席。委员有十个，都是那些财阀、政客和声名赫赫的退休将军们。委员会还有一个由十一人组成的“顾问小组”和一个五人组成的“协助顾问小组”，以及委员会的“助手”，组织极为庞大。
    看看这个委员会里的大财阀代表吧。这里有属于库恩—罗比财团的曼哈顿大通银行的代表麦克洛埃；摩根财团的贝尔电话实验所的代表费斯克、凯莱和普里姆。还有新英格兰电气公司的代表韦伯斯特；史普拉格电气公司的经理史普拉格；麦金西公司的代表柯尔逊；卡尼基公司的代表佩金斯等等。
    退休后担任大企业要职的人物有：前国防部长、现布朗兄弟哈里曼银行的罗维特；前国防部副部长、现奥林·麦奇逊化学公司的福斯特；前美国海军作战部长、现属于梅隆财团的威斯汀豪斯电气公司的海军上将卡涅；在第二次世界大战中第一次轰炸东京的美国空军将军、现美国壳牌石油公司的杜利特；前美国远东军总司令兼侵朝“联合国军”司令、现任美国化学制造商协会主席赫尔。
    在政府和科学技术界担任要职的有：总统科学顾问委员会主席拉比；总统科学和技术顾问、马萨诸塞理工学院的基利安和这个学院的教授魏斯纳；加里福尼亚大学放射实验所的劳伦斯；前国务院政策顾问委员会主任、现在华盛顿大学任职的尼兹。
    在军事研究机关担任要职的有：美国军事学院的林肯和防御分析研究所的所长麦考密克将军和副所长希耳。此外，还有新闻界的代表，如哥伦比亚广播公司经理斯坦顿等。
    从这些人物和他们的背景中可以看出，美国的大财阀是多么不顾“实力”政策的破产，仍然热中于扩军备战，那些退休的好战将军们，也并没有因为脱下军服而放下屠刀。　（杰）
