Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 16th: Burmese Federal Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein and the Burmese Goodwill Economic Delegation he leads focused on understanding the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in Shanghai on the 16th.

In the morning, Vice Premier U Kyaw Nyein and some members of the delegation, accompanied by Deputy Mayor Cao Diqiu, visited the jointly owned public-private Shenxin No. 9 Factory. Rong Yiren and Wu Zhongyi, the private factory director, introduced the situation of the factory before and after the joint public-private ownership to the guests. Shenxin No. 9 Factory is one of the factories in the Shenxin Textile System owned by capitalist Rong Yiren's family. In 1956, the factory's total output value increased by 27% compared to before the joint operation in 1955, and the cost decreased by 13.15%. The changes in this factory aroused U Kyaw Nyein's interest. He also raised questions about the production management, wages, and benefits of the joint public-private factory, and continued to talk with Rong Yiren in the evening.

In the afternoon, Vice Premier U Kyaw Nyein and others held a discussion with six Shanghai commercial capitalists, including Guo Linshuang, to specifically understand the operational management of various private commercial joint ventures in Shanghai before and after the implementation of socialist transformation.

Vice Premier U Kyaw Nyein and others also visited the state-owned Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory, which produced fine spinning machines for Burma last year, and were warmly welcomed by the workers.

Vice Premier U Kyaw Nyein's wife visited the Jade Buddha Temple, and some members of the delegation visited Fudan University.

Tonight, Rong Yiren hosted a casual dinner at his home for Vice Premier U Kyaw Nyein and his wife.
