Jiangsu Provincial Party Congress Achieves Remarkable Results in Great Unfolding and Great Contending
Right-leaning Thought Disappears and Revolutionary Drive Soars
Representatives Propose Slogans for a Great Leap Forward in Agricultural Production such as "Jiangbei Surpassing Jiangnan" and "Jiangnan Catching Up with Chao'an"

(Our Correspondent Zhen Weimin Reports) The Second Session of the Third Congress of the Communist Party of China in Jiangsu Province concluded on December 12th. The meeting successfully adopted the democratic form of great unfolding and great contending, criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking among cadres at all levels, and made the once-deflated revolutionary drive rise sharply again. More than 2,800 representatives attending the meeting resolved to launch a great production movement with the momentum of "fierce tigers descending the mountain," and put forward resounding slogans such as "Jiangbei surpassing Jiangnan and Jiangnan catching up with Chao'an." They demanded that the new rice-growing areas in northern Jiangsu strive towards 800 jin per mu, and the Taihu and Lixiahe areas south of the Huai River strive towards targets of 900 jin and 1,000 jin.

Since the promulgation of the Draft National Program for Agricultural Development in 1956, Jiangsu Province has carried out high-yield and bumper-harvest competitions. Although it suffered from extraordinary natural disasters last year, grain output still exceeded that of 1954. However, in the past year, a considerable adverse wind has blown inside and outside the Party. Many people mistakenly believed that the Forty Articles were "bragging," and that the increased production measures were "rash." The thought that one could only advance gradually and not leap forward gained the upper hand again. The Provincial Party Committee did not criticize these right-leaning conservative ideas forcefully enough, and some increased production measures were not implemented resolutely enough. As a result, although this year had better natural conditions than 1955, the output was lower than in 1955. Although the increased production measures such as changing dry land to paddy fields this year have made progress compared with last year, farmland water conservancy, increasing natural fertilizer accumulation, and afforestation were all worse than last year, and double-cropping rice actually decreased by 100,000 mu compared with last year. Right-leaning conservative thinking has become the main obstacle to the great leap forward in production.

The conference lasted for one month of preparatory meetings and twelve days of formal meetings. Many representatives believed that this was a meeting of ideological revolution. The representatives recognized the requirements of the revolutionary situation for themselves and resolved to achieve the increased production target of 50 billion jin of grain per year within ten years. This target not only doubles the province's grain output, but also exceeds the requirements of the National Program for Agricultural Development. Cotton, oil crops, pig raising, aquaculture, and sericulture will also have multiple-fold growth. Five years later, the income of all farmers in the province will exceed the level of well-to-do middle peasants. And the targets put forward by representatives from various regions greatly exceeded the province's planning requirements. The Suzhou and Songjiang special districts south of the Yangtze River will both achieve the target of 800 jin per mu within five years. Among them, the five counties of Jinshan, Jiangyin, Fengxian, Zhenze, and Shanghai all demanded to reach 800 jin in 1958. Jinshan County even demanded an average grain yield of 1,600 jin per mu throughout the county within ten years. Representatives from Xuzhou and Huaiyin special districts north of the Huai River also expressed their greatest determination to fundamentally improve the backward state of production and economy in this area, eliminate drought and flood disasters, eliminate low-yielding fields, change the situation where people have no toilets and pigs have no pens, and promote "changing dry land to paddy fields" and other increased production measures, striving for "three changes in three years, 500 jin in five years, and ten years of hard work to surpass Jiangnan." The representatives described that the Xuhuai area at that time would be "a thousand years of dry land turning into paddy fields, peach red and willow green with fragrant rice flowers, livestock and aquatic products are prosperous, cotton, flax, oil, and grain are full of warehouses, boosting morale for another leap forward, even better scenery than Jiangnan." Representatives from mountainous areas such as Zhenjiang, Yizheng, and Liuhe also decided to vigorously develop mountainous areas, implement the policy of combining agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations, and build mountainous areas into economic crop areas dominated by tea, striving to make the income of each farmer catch up with the level of local well-to-do middle peasants within three to five years. Representatives from cotton-growing areas such as Songjiang, Nantong, and Yancheng special districts also resolved to learn from Hong'an County and strive to achieve the increased production targets for cotton fields stipulated in the Forty Articles ahead of schedule. The cotton-growing areas of Songjiang and Nantong special districts must strive to become "100-jin ginned cotton counties" within five years.

The reason why the meeting achieved such significant results was that a struggle between advanced and backward thinking was carried out around the questions of "Can we leap forward? Do we want to leap forward? Do we dare to leap forward?" The meeting criticized the following three types of right-leaning conservative thinking that lagged behind the situation: One type is that they simply do not believe that a leap forward is possible. They say that the "four, five, eight" indicators are "bragging" and that reform is "rash." They are unwilling to learn from the advanced experiences of other places and only believe in their own old "steady rise." The second type of person is half-believing and half-doubting about the leap forward, taking one step forward and two steps back. When others say they can leap forward, they hurry forward. When others say it is "rash," they quickly "stand at attention" to avoid making mistakes and avoid "the gun shooting the bird that sticks its head out." Some of them have serious dependence thinking and are afraid of starting from scratch and relying on their own efforts. Their socialist enthusiasm is not high, they are content with the status quo, and they lack the spirit of "starting a business." The third type is the "small-footed women" who hold back. They often use the excuse of "making rash mistakes" to scare others, often using shortcomings in steps and methods to negate the fundamental direction of development, using errors in specific work to negate the achievements in the main aspects, and using the attitude of a third party to pick on, hinder, and even satirize and attack the growth of advanced things in every possible way.

After debate and discussion, the representatives unanimously affirmed that Jiangsu Province is located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, and its geographical environment, climatic conditions, natural resources, and economic foundation are all quite superior, and there is infinite potential for increasing production in rural areas. Representatives from the Taihu area south of the Yangtze River severely criticized the idea of reaching the limit of increased production. Chu Jiang, First Secretary of the Suzhou Prefectural Committee, said: In the past, our increase in production was not large, mainly because in many cases, we were content with the status quo, did not seek a leap forward, only looked backward, and did not look forward. Guo Yuhan, Deputy Secretary of the Songjiang Prefectural Committee, also said: The current state of production in our region is not commensurate with the superior natural conditions, which is greatly related to the fact that the leadership's thinking lags behind the actual situation and the idea that "high-yield areas can only advance gradually and cannot leap forward" is prevalent within the Party. Many representatives in this region believe: "It is a shame if high-yield areas cannot achieve high yields. In the future, we must make a great leap forward in thinking and action, and we cannot sit idly on the chair of high-yield areas." Representatives from Yangzhou, Xuzhou, Huaiyin and other special districts located on both sides of the Huai River Irrigation Main Canal, in their speeches, profoundly criticized the insufficient understanding of the fundamental changes brought about by cooperativization, harnessing the Huai River, and diverting the Yi River, the lack of confidence in reform, and the existence of serious dependence thinking.

While the revolutionary enthusiasm of the representatives was unprecedentedly high, the meeting pointed out that achieving the various targets of the National Program for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule is a combat task that must be completed with revolutionary methods. Therefore, first of all, it is required that leading cadres at all levels personally go to the mountains, go into the water, participate in labor, engage in experimental fields, and study hard to master agricultural production knowledge. The meeting required Party committees at all levels to deeply mobilize the masses, immediately mobilize 10 million to 15 million farmers to participate in the winter and spring great production movement, and make remarkable achievements in the four tasks of increasing fertilizer accumulation, building water conservancy, maintaining draught cattle, and cultivating three wheats (barley, wheat, and naked barley), and strive to eliminate Class III cooperatives and low-yielding wheat fields with yields below 100 jin in the first half of next year, ensure a summer harvest of 8 billion jin, and strive to reach 8.5 billion jin. In this way, the province's total grain output of 28.5 billion jin next year, an increase of 14% over this year's plan, will have a reliable guarantee.

    江苏省党代表大会大放大争成效显著
    右倾思想消失革命干劲昂扬
    代表们提出江北赛过江南、江南赶上潮安等农业生产大跃进的口号
    本报讯　记者甄为民报道：中共江苏省第三届代表大会第二次会议已于12月12日闭幕。会议成功地采用了大放大争的民主形式，批判了各级干部中的右倾保守思想，使一度泄了气的革命干劲又直线上升。到会的二千八百多位代表决以“猛虎下山”之势，发动大生产运动，提出了“江北赛过江南、江南赶上潮安”的响亮口号。要求淮北新稻区向八百斤的方向努力，淮河以南的太湖和里下河地区要向九百斤、一千斤的目标努力。
    自1956年农业发展纲要草案公布以来，江苏全省开展了高额丰产竞赛，去年虽然受到特大的自然灾害，粮食产量仍超过了1954年。但是，近一年来，党内外却刮起了一阵不小的歪风，不少人错误地认为四十条是“吹牛”，增产措施“冒进”了，只能渐进、不能跃进的思想又占了上风。省委对这些右倾保守思想批判不够有力，某些增产措施也贯彻得不够坚决，以致今年虽有比1955年好的自然条件，但产量却比1955年低。今年的旱田改水田等增产措施虽比去年有进展，但农田水利、增积自然肥料、造林等都比去年差，双季稻反而比去年减少了十万亩。右倾保守思想已成为生产大跃进的主要障碍。
    这次会议共开了一个月的预备会和十二天的正式会议。许多代表都认为这是一次思想革命的会议。到会代表认清了革命形势对自己的要求，决心在十年之内达到年产五百亿斤粮食的增产指标，这个指标不但使全省的粮食产量跃进一倍，而且超过了全国农业发展纲要的要求。棉花、油料作物、生猪饲养、水产、蚕桑事业也将有成倍的增长。五年以后全省农民的收入都将超过富裕中农的水平。而各个地区代表提出的指标，则又大大超过了全省的规划要求。长江以南的苏州、松江两专区都要在五年之内实现亩产八百斤的指标，其中金山、江阴、奉贤、震泽、上海五个县都要求在1958年达到八百斤，金山县更要求在十年之内全县平均亩产粮食一千六百斤。淮河以北的徐州、淮阴等专区的代表也表示最大决心，从根本上改进这个地区生产和经济落后的面貌，消灭旱涝灾害，消灭低产田，改变人无厕所猪无圈的情况，推行“旱改水”等增产措施，争取“三年三改制，五年五百斤，十年苦干赛江南。”代表们描画那时的徐淮地区将是“千年旱地变水田，桃红柳绿稻花香，六畜水产皆兴旺，棉麻油料谷满仓，鼓舞士气再跃进，胜似江南好风光。”镇江、仪征、六合等山区的代表也决定大力开发山区，贯彻农、林、牧、副业相结合的方针，把山区建成为以茶叶为主的经济作物地区，争取在三、五年内使每个农民的收入赶过当地富裕中农的水平。松江、南通、盐城等专区的棉区代表，也决心向红安县学习，争取提前实现四十条规定的棉田增产指标，松江、南通两专区的棉区都要争取在五年内成为“百斤皮棉县。”
    会议所以取得这样重大的成果，是因为围绕“能不能跃进？要不要跃进？敢不敢跃进”的问题，进行了先进和落后思想的斗争。会议批判了以下三种落后于形势的右倾保守思想：一种是根本不相信可能跃进，他们说“四、五、八”的指标是“吹牛”，改制是“冒进”，他们不愿学习别处的先进经验，只相信自己老一套的“稳步上升”。第二种人对跃进半信半疑，进一步，退两步，别人说能跃进，他就赶紧向前跑，别人说是“冒进”，他就赶紧“立正”，免得犯错误，免得“枪打出头鸟”，其中有些人有严重的依赖思想，怕白手成家，自力更生，他们的社会主义的热情不高，满足于现状，缺乏“创业”的精神。第三种是拖后腿的“小脚女人”，他们往往拿“会犯冒进错误”来吓唬别人，往往以步骤方法上的缺点，来否定根本性的发展方向，以具体工作上的错误，来否定主要方面的成绩，以第三者的态度去百般挑剔、阻碍，甚至讽刺和打击先进事物的生长。
    经过辩论和讨论，代表们一致肯定，江苏省处于长江、淮河的下游，地理环境、气候条件、自然资源、经济基础都是相当优越的，农村增产有无穷的潜力。长江以南太湖地区的代表，严肃地批判了增产到顶的思想。苏州地委第一书记储江说：过去我们的增产幅度不大，主要是我们在很多情况下，安于现状，不求跃进，只向后看，不向前看。松江地委副书记郭玉汉也说：我区的生产现状和优越的自然条件不相称，是和领导思想落后于实际，党内流行着“高产地区只能渐进，不能跃进”的思想有很大的关系。这个地区的许多代表认为：“高产地区不能高产，于心有愧，今后一定要从思想到行动上来一个大跃进，不能虚坐高产地区的凳子”。地处淮河灌溉总渠两岸的扬州、徐州、淮阴等专区的代表，他们在发言中都深刻地批判了对合作化、治淮、导沂带来的根本变化认识不足，对改制缺乏信心，存在严重的依赖思想。
    在代表们革命热情空前高涨的同时，会议指出提前实现农业发展纲要的各项指标是一个战斗任务，必须用革命的方法来完成。因此首先要求各级领导干部都要亲自上山、下水、参加劳动，搞试验田，下苦功学习，掌握农业生产知识。会议要求各级党委，深入发动群众，立即动员一千万到一千五百万农民参加冬春大生产运动，在增积肥料、兴修水利、保养耕牛和培植三麦（大麦、小麦、元麦）等四项工作中做出显著成绩，争取在明年上半年就能消灭三类社，消灭百斤以下的低产麦田，确保夏熟产量八十亿斤，争取达到八十五亿斤，这样，明年全省产粮二百八十五亿斤，比今年增产14％的计划，就有了可靠的保证。
