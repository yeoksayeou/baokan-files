    Welcoming the Visit of Yemeni Crown Prince Badr to Our Country

    Yemeni Crown Prince, Deputy Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Defense Minister of the Kingdom of Yemen, Saif al-Islam Muhammad al-Badr, arrives in our country today for a friendly visit. Crown Prince Badr comes from the distant land of "Arabia Felix," bringing the cordial friendship of the Yemeni and Arab people to the Chinese people. Our people warmly welcome his arrival!

    Although China and Yemen are geographically far apart, our two peoples have a very long history of friendship. As early as the 15th century, our famous navigator Zheng He visited the fertile land of Yemen. For a long period thereafter, the aggression of Western imperialist forces against Eastern countries disrupted the friendly exchanges between our two countries. However, in recent years, we have not only restored the contacts that existed long ago but have also established closer friendly relations under new historical conditions. At the Bandung Conference, our Premier Zhou Enlai had cordial talks with representatives of the Government of the Kingdom of Yemen, and the delegations of the two countries cooperated well to ensure the smooth development of the conference. In August 1956, China and Yemen officially established diplomatic relations, further developing the friendship between our two countries to a new stage.

    The friendly cooperative relations between our country and the Kingdom of Yemen have a deep common foundation. Our two peoples both love peace and oppose war; we both cherish our national independence and resolutely oppose colonialist aggression. We have much in common, and the resolutions of the Bandung Conference are our common goals and the principles we jointly uphold. Therefore, it is no accident that our two peoples continuously strengthen mutual support and concern in the cause of maintaining peace and opposing aggression. We are particularly grateful for the friendly action of the Kingdom of Yemen's representatives in voting in support of our country's legitimate seat in the United Nations General Assembly.

    The Yemeni people are a diligent and courageous people, and they have demonstrated indomitable will in the struggle against colonialism and in defense of national independence. The Yemeni people have waged long and heroic struggles against Turkish invaders and British colonialists. In recent years, British colonialists have continuously invaded the territory of the Kingdom of Yemen, even dispatching aircraft to barbarously bomb peaceful Yemeni towns. However, the Yemeni people have repeatedly risen up to defend their homeland and repelled the armed attacks of the British colonialists. During the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt, the Yemeni people resolutely stood by the Egyptian people, supported their just struggle, and demonstrated the noble spirit of Arab national unity. And when U.S. imperialism intensified its aggression in the Middle East, attempting to split the unity of the Arab countries, the Kingdom of Yemen resolutely joined Egypt, Syria, and other Arab countries in condemning the aggressors and rejecting the "Eisenhower Doctrine," making a positive contribution to maintaining the unity of the Arab countries and peace in the Middle East. The Yemeni people's efforts to resist imperialist aggression, uphold the unity of the Arab countries, and maintain peace in the Middle East have won the praise of peace-loving countries and peoples around the world and have greatly enhanced the international standing of the Kingdom of Yemen.

    This visit of Crown Prince Badr to our country at the invitation of our Premier Zhou Enlai will further deepen the understanding and friendly relations between our two peoples. Although it is Crown Prince Badr's first visit to our country, his contributions to safeguarding his country's sovereignty and promoting friendly relations between the Kingdom of Yemen and peace-loving countries have long made him famous in China. Crown Prince Badr's efforts to strengthen Sino-Yemeni diplomatic relations are all the more greatly respected by the Chinese people. We wish Crown Prince Badr a pleasant stay and good health during his visit to our country!

    欢迎也门王太子巴德尔访问我国
    也门王太子、也门王国副首相兼外交大臣和国防大臣塞弗·伊斯兰·穆罕默德·巴德尔今天到达我国进行友好访问。巴德尔王太子来自遥远的“阿拉伯的乐园”之国，他给中国人民带来了也门和阿拉伯人民的亲切的友情。我国人民怀着热烈的心情欢迎他的莅临！
    中国和也门虽然在地理上相距很远，但我们两国人民之间在历史上却有着极悠久的友谊。远在十五世纪的时候，我国著名的航海家郑和就曾经访问过也门富饶的土地。在以后很长一段时期里，由于西方帝国主义势力对东方各国的侵略，使我们两国之间的友好往来陷于隔绝。可是近年来，我们两国之间不仅恢复了久远以前曾经有过的接触，而且在新的历史条件下建立了更亲密的友好关系。在万隆会议上，我国周恩来总理同也门王国政府代表进行了亲切的交谈，两国代表团为了会议的顺利发展，曾经进行了很好的合作。1956年8月，我国和也门正式建立了外交关系，更使我们两国之间的友谊发展到了一个新的阶段。
    我国和也门王国的友好合作关系，有着深厚的共同基础。我们两国人民都热爱和平，反对战争；我们都珍视自己的民族独立，坚决反对殖民主义的侵略。我们有着许多共同的语言，而万隆会议的决议，就是我们共同争取的目标和共同维护的原则。因此，我们两国人民在维护和平和反对侵略的事业中，不断地加强相互支持和关怀，这绝不是偶然的。我们特别感谢也门王国代表在联合国大会上投票支持我国在联合国合法地位的友好行动。
    也门人民是勤劳而勇敢的人民，他们在反抗殖民主义和保卫民族独立的斗争中，表现坚忍不拔的意志。也门人民同土耳其侵略者和英国殖民者进行过长期的英勇斗争。近年来，英国殖民者不断侵犯也门王国的领土，甚至出动飞机野蛮地轰炸也门的和平城镇。但是也门人民一次又一次地奋起捍卫祖国的领土，击退了英国殖民者的武装进攻。在英法和以色列侵略埃及的战争中，也门人民坚决地站在埃及人民一边，支持了埃及人民的正义斗争，表现了阿拉伯民族崇高的团结精神。而当美国帝国主义加紧侵略中东，力图分裂阿拉伯国家团结的时候，也门王国又坚决地同埃及、叙利亚等阿拉伯国家一道谴责侵略者，拒绝了“艾森豪威尔主义”，对维护阿拉伯国家团结和中东和平作出了积极的贡献。也门人民反抗帝国主义侵略、坚持阿拉伯国家的团结和维护中东和平的努力，赢得了世界爱好和平国家和人民的赞誉，大大提高了也门王国的国际地位。
    这次巴德尔王太子应我国周恩来总理的邀请到我国来访问，将会进一步加深我们两国人民之间的了解和友好关系。虽然巴德尔王太子还是第一次来到我国，但是他在维护自己国家主权、促进也门王国同爱好和平国家之间的友好关系的事业中所作的贡献，早已使他名播中国。巴德尔王太子对加强中、也两国外交关系所作的努力，更受到中国人民极大的尊敬。我们谨祝巴德尔王太子在访问我国期间，精神愉快，身体健康！
