Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta: According to reports from Xinhua News Agency: The Indonesian government formally notified the Dutch diplomatic mission in Indonesia on the 4th, demanding that all Dutch consulates in Indonesia cease operations and that consulate staff be withdrawn from Indonesia.

This important measure was decided by the Indonesian cabinet at its meeting on the morning of the 4th. It is understood that closing the consulates does not mean severing diplomatic relations. The Netherlands has consulates in seven Indonesian cities: Bandung, Semarang, Surabaya, Makassar, Palembang, Medan, and Banjarmasin.

At its meeting on the 5th, the Indonesian cabinet also decided to notify Dutch people who are not needed by the Indonesian government to leave Indonesia. It also decided to prohibit the transfer of profits earned by Dutch companies and the transfer of Dutch welfare funds in Indonesia.

The Indonesian cabinet decided to transfer Dutch companies already taken over by workers to a management committee, and stipulated that these companies continue to operate under the supervision of the government. The government has decided to take over the Dutch Royal Shipping Company, and the management committee will be responsible for leading the daily work of this company.

In order to ensure the smooth flow of Indonesian maritime transport, the cabinet requested the Ministry of Maritime Affairs to nationalize the wharves and warehouses operated by the Dutch in Indonesia.

Indonesian Minister of Justice Maenkum has ordered Dutch people without jobs in Indonesia to leave the country. According to an immigration official, this order also applies to Dutch people whose positions can be taken over by Indonesians. The Indonesian immigration authorities have negotiated with Dutch representatives, asking them to assist the Dutch in returning to the Netherlands.

It is understood that there are currently about 50,000 Dutch people in Indonesia.

The Indonesian National Construction Conference closed on the afternoon of the 4th. The conference passed a resolution calling for severing trade and economic relations with the Netherlands, and confiscating or taking over all Dutch companies in Indonesia.

The National Construction Conference opened on November 25th. During the ten-day meeting, after group discussions and speeches at the conference, the conference passed nine resolutions on issues such as economic construction, the establishment of a National Planning Commission, and the recovery of West Irian.

The resolution stated that mines and major telecommunications and transportation enterprises should in principle be operated by the government, and mining licenses that have already been issued must be reconsidered as to whether they should have been issued. The resolution called for the nationalization of plantations operated by foreigners in the short term.

The conference also passed a resolution on foreign policy, which stated that Indonesia's defense policy must be consistent with the independence of its foreign policy, which is based on the principles of peace and maintaining friendly relations with all countries. This means that Indonesia will not participate in any military blocs. The resolution also expressed the hope that the Second Asian-African Conference would be held as soon as possible.

The chairman of the closing meeting, Dr. Hatta, handed over the resolution to Prime Minister Juanda and pointed out that the meeting was very successful.

President Sukarno said in his closing remarks that he hoped the delegates would bring the very good atmosphere of unity from the meeting to the outside world. He emphasized that national unity is an absolutely necessary condition for construction. He also said that he was not 100% satisfied with the results of the meeting.

Indonesian Minister of Justice Maenkum confirmed on the 4th that the Indonesian government has banned Dutch nationals from entering Indonesian territory. He said that this measure is correct because the government does not want Dutch nationals to continue to stay in Indonesia.

In his speech, Maenkum refuted the statement made by Dutch Prime Minister Willem Drees in Parliament on December 3rd. Maenkum said that the Indonesian government is prepared to help as many Dutch nationals as possible here to return to their country as soon as possible. Therefore, the claim made by the Dutch government that the Indonesian government prohibits Dutch people from leaving Indonesia is incorrect.

He said that the Indonesian people's struggle to liberate West Irian under the leadership of their government will not undermine humanitarianism. The Dutch government's claim that the Indonesian government brutally prohibits the supply of water and electricity to Dutch residents in Indonesia is a fabrication by the Dutch government.

New York News: Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio told reporters in New York on the 3rd that whether relations between Indonesia and the Netherlands will break down in the future depends on the further attitude of the Netherlands.

Subandrio expressed disappointment at the United Nations General Assembly's rejection of the proposal on the West Irian issue. He said that the anti-Dutch demonstrations currently taking place in Indonesia are a natural reflection of the Indonesian people's disappointment with this decision by the United Nations.

Subandrio criticized the United States' attitude towards the West Irian issue. He said that the "neutral stance" taken by the United States on this issue is a matter of great regret to the Indonesian government. (Attached picture)

At precisely 12:00 noon on November 25th, the bells and drums of all mosques in Jakarta rang together, and the sirens of factories and locomotives sounded at the same time. All citizens stopped working for five minutes to express their determination to recover West Irian. At 12:00 noon, vehicles on the roads of Jakarta also temporarily stopped traffic.

    印度尼西亚对荷兰采取进一步行动
    通知荷兰封闭领事馆命令一些荷侨离境
    全国建设会议要求同荷兰断绝经济关系
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：雅加达消息：印度尼西亚政府4日正式通知荷兰驻印度尼西亚的外交机构，要求停止荷兰设在印度尼西亚的全部领事馆的工作，并且将领事馆人员撤出印度尼西亚。
    这一重要措施是印度尼西亚内阁在4日早上的会议上决定的。据悉，封闭领事馆并不意味着断绝外交关系。荷兰在印度尼西亚的万隆、三宝垄、泗水、望加锡、巨港、棉兰和马辰等七个城市设有领事馆。
    印度尼西亚内阁在5日的会议上还决定通知那些印度尼西亚政府所不需要的荷兰人离开印度尼西亚，并且决定了禁止转移荷兰企业所赚取的利润和禁止转移荷兰在印度尼西亚的福利基金。
    印度尼西亚内阁决定把工人已经接管的荷兰企业移交给一个管理委员会，并且规定这些企业在政府的监督下继续经营。政府已经决定接管荷兰皇家轮船公司，管理委员会将负责领导这个企业的日常工作。
    为了保证印度尼西亚海上航运的畅通，内阁要求海运部把荷兰在印度尼西亚经营的码头和仓库也收归国有。
    印度尼西亚司法部长马恩科姆已经命令在印度尼西亚没有职业的荷兰人离境。据一个移民官员说，这个命令也适用于那些职位可以由印度尼西亚人接替的荷兰人。印度尼西亚移民当局已经同荷方代表谈判，要求他们协助荷兰人回到荷兰去。
    据悉，目前在印度尼西亚约有五万名荷兰人。
    印度尼西亚全国建设会议在4日下午闭幕。会议通过了决议，要求同荷兰断绝贸易和经济关系，并且没收或者接管在印度尼西亚的所有荷兰企业。
    全国建设会议是在11月25日开幕的，在十天的会议期间，经过小组讨论和会上发言以后，会议通过了关于经济建设、成立国家计划委员会和收复西伊里安等问题的九项决议。
    决议说，矿山和主要的电讯和运输企业原则上应该由政府经营，已经发出的采矿许可证必须重新考虑是否应当发出。决议要求在短期内把外国人经营的种植园收归国有。
   会议还通过了一项有关外交政策的决议，决议说，印度尼西亚的防御政策必须符合以和平原则以及同一切国家保持友好关系为基础的外交政策的独立性。这就是说，印度尼西亚不参加任何军事集团。决议还表示希望早日召开第二次亚非会议。
    闭幕会议的主席哈达博士把决议交给朱安达总理，并且指出，会议开得很成功。
    苏加诺总统在发表闭幕词的时候说，他希望代表们把会议中非常好的团结气氛带到会议外面去。他着重指出，全国团结一致是进行建设的绝对必要的条件。他还表示，他对会议的结果还不是百分之百地满意。
    印度尼西亚司法部长马恩科姆4日证实，印度尼西亚政府已经禁止荷兰国民进入印度尼西亚领土。他说，这种措施是正确的，因为政府不希望荷兰国民继续留在印度尼西亚。
    马恩科姆在他的谈话中驳斥了荷兰首相威廉·德里斯12月3日在议会中所发表的声明。马恩科姆说，印度尼西亚政府准备帮助这里的尽可能多的荷兰国民尽快返回本国。因此，荷兰政府所提出的硬说印度尼西亚政府禁止荷兰人离开印度尼西亚的那种说法是不正确的。
    他说，印度尼西亚人民在他们的政府的领导下所进行的争取解放西伊里安的斗争，并不会破坏人道主义。荷兰政府说，印度尼西亚政府残暴地禁止向在印度尼西亚的荷兰居民供应水电，这是荷兰政府所捏造的谎言。
    纽约消息：印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约3日在纽约对记者说，今后印度尼西亚和荷兰的关系是否会破裂，要看荷兰的进一步态度而定。
    苏班德里约对联合国大会拒绝通过关于西伊里安问题的提案表示失望。他说，目前在印度尼西亚发生反对荷兰的示威运动，是印度尼西亚人民对联合国这一决定感到失望的自然反映。
    苏班德里约指责美国对西伊里安问题的态度。他说，美国对这个问题采取的“中立的立场”，使印度尼西亚政府感到非常遗憾。（附图片）
    11月25日十二点正，雅加达全市清真寺的钟鼓齐鸣，工厂和机车的汽笛同时鸣放，全体市民停止工作五分钟，表示他们收复西伊里安的决心。这是在十二点正，雅加达马路上的车辆也暂时停止通行。　新华社稿
