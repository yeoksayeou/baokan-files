    Revolutionary Examination
    某 Infantry School of the People's Liberation Army, Wen Qinggui
    The People’s Daily reported that the Ministry of Communications had a big-character poster sharply criticizing the bureaucratic work style of a vice minister in charge of the Law Office. The author of the big-character poster, who has been in charge of the Law Office for one year and two months, demanded a 'business examination' for the vice minister, with three questions to choose two from: 1. Have you ever been to the Law Office? 2. How many times have you asked us to report on our work? 3. Which regulations are the Law Office currently drafting?
    The reporter did not further report what kind of answers the vice minister could give, but people no longer need to ask.
    Such an examination is indeed a revolutionary examination. The nationwide rectification movement is an examination for everyone, or, in popular terms, a test of whether one can pass the socialist test.
    We should indeed use examinations to expose the three bad styles. I think every leader should take such an examination, and the test questions can also be three: 1. Do you often go deep into the masses? 2. Can you discuss matters with the masses? 3. Do you care about the suffering of the masses? Every ordinary staff member should also be asked these three questions: 1. Have you firmly stood on the working-class position? 2. Have you voiced all your opinions to the leadership? 3. Have you spoken your mind?
    Intellectual cadres also face an examination, and people will test them: 1. Do you have the feelings of workers and peasants? 2. Can you distinguish the five grains? 3. Can you carry things on your shoulders and lift them with your hands? To answer these three questions well, one must resolutely, bravely, and happily go to labor to temper oneself, and actively respond to the call of "going to the countryside and mountains."

    革命的考试
    解放军某步兵学校  文庆归
    人民日报上报道交通部有一张大字报，尖锐地批评一位分工领导法律室的副部长的官僚主义作风。这位副部长分工领导法律室已经一年零二月，大字报的作者，要求对这位副部长举行一次‘业务考试’，考题共有三个，任选两题作答：1、你到过法律室没有？2、你几次叫我们汇报过工作？3、法律室正在草拟哪个法规？
    记者没有进一步报道这位副部长能作出什么样的答案，但人们已经不需要去追问了。
    像这样的考试，确实是革命的考试。全民的整风运动，对每个人都是一次考试，用通俗的说法，也就是过社会主义关。
    我们确实应该用考试的办法来揭发三个坏主义。我想每一个领导者都应该举行这样一次考试，试题也可以出三个：1、你经常深入到群众中去吗？2、你遇事能和群众商量吗？3、你关心群众的疾苦吗？对每一个一般工作人员，也应该考他们这样三个问题：1、你站稳了工人阶级立场吗？2、你对领导的意见都提完了吗？3、你的心里话都说出来了吗？
    在知识分子干部面前，也面临着一次考试，人们要考他们：1、你具备了工农的感情吗？2、你能分辨五谷吗？3、肩能挑、手能提吗？要想回答好这三个问题，那就是坚决地、勇敢地、愉快地到劳动中去锻炼，积极的响应“下乡上山”的号召。
