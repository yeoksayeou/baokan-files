Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 25th: On the eve of the opening of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, approximately five hundred representatives from over forty countries in Asia and Africa are arriving in Cairo from all directions. The people of this famous ancient city on the Nile, with colorful flags and countless enthusiastic slogans, are welcoming this historically significant gathering with excitement.

    The conference is scheduled to open at the Cairo University Auditorium on the morning of the 26th. According to the provisional agenda distributed by the conference secretariat, during the seven-day meeting, in addition to the opening and closing ceremonies, there will be six plenary sessions and many committee meetings. The conference will establish five committees on political, cultural, economic, social, and organizational work. The organizational work committee will discuss the establishment of a permanent institution after the conclusion of the conference.  The conference will hear reports on the general international situation, imperialism, colonialism, the Algerian question, racial discrimination, and six political reports on nuclear weapons, three economic reports, two cultural reports, and one social report. Heads of all delegations will speak at the conference.

    It is believed that this conference is the most important international conference ever held on the African continent. Among the forty-plus countries participating in the conference, many are sending their own delegations to an international conference for the first time. Several international organizations and countries from other continents will send representatives to attend the conference as observers.

    The host country, Egypt, has made thorough preparations for its guests. One of the largest and most beautiful hotels in Cairo, as well as other hotels, have been reserved specifically to accommodate the representatives. In front of the conference venue and in many squares, concise and moving slogans written in Arabic, Chinese, Russian, English, and French have been posted. Colorful flags flutter on both sides of the Nile Palace Bridge across the Nile.

    The opening and closing ceremonies of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference are scheduled to be held at the Cairo University Auditorium. The plenary session hall is the former Senate of the Farouk Dynasty. It is now the seat of the Egyptian National Assembly. In this very place, where a few once ruled over the vast people during the era of imperialist rule, hundreds of people's representatives from the two continents will gather together to discuss strengthening the struggle against imperialism. Seats have been added to the hall to accommodate all representatives, observers, and journalists. The hall is equipped with headphones for simultaneous interpretation in Arabic, English, and French. Each representative's seat is equipped with a microphone for making impromptu speeches.

    The conference secretariat has become one of the busiest places in the city in recent days. In addition to the registration of all delegations, it is also receiving news about various delegations and letters and telegrams from around the world expressing support for and congratulating the conference. Journalists are flocking there for interviews. As of the 24th, the secretariat had issued more than one hundred press passes.

    The conference has recently become the focus of attention for newspapers and observers here. Khaled Mohieddin, Deputy Head of the Egyptian delegation to the conference and Editor-in-Chief of "Al-Masaa," wrote in "Al-Masaa": "One of the aims of the conference is to make the Bandung Principles an integral part of the lives of the Asian and African people." He expressed his belief that the conference "will unite the people of all countries to jointly carry out the struggle for freedom and eliminate the imperialist forces in the two continents forever."

    Egyptian newspapers have also reported on the panic of Western countries regarding this conference. "Al-Masaa" quoted a New York National Broadcasting Company correspondent stationed here as saying: "Cairo, having been selected as the venue for the upcoming Asian-African Solidarity Conference, has become another occasion to express opposition to the West… Western political observers are calling the convening of this conference the season for striking Western imperialism."

    四十多个国家代表云集开罗
    亚非团结大会今天开幕
    新华社开罗25日电　在亚非团结大会开幕前夕，亚非两大洲四十多个国家的约五百位代表正从四面八方陆续来到开罗。尼罗河畔这个著名古城的人民怀着兴奋的心情，以五彩缤纷的旗帜和无数热情的标语，来迎接这个具有历史意义的聚会。
    大会预定26日上午在开罗大学大礼堂开幕。根据大会秘书处分发的临时议程，在七天会议期间，除了开幕式和闭幕式以外，将举行六次全体会议和许多次委员会会议。大会将成立关于政治、文化、经济、社会和组织工作的五个委员会。组织工作委员会将讨论在大会闭幕后成立常设机构的问题。大会将听取关于一般国际形势、帝国主义、殖民主义、阿尔及利亚问题、种族歧视和核武器的六个政治报告，三篇经济问题报告、两篇文化问题报告和一篇社会问题报告。各代表团团长都将在会上发言。
    人们认为，这次大会是历来在非洲大陆上举行的最重要的一次国际会议。在参加大会的四十多个国家中，有许多国家是第一次派遣自己的代表团参加国际会议。还有若干国际组织和别洲的国家将派代表以观察员身份列席会议。
    东道国埃及已经为客人们作了周到的准备。开罗一家最大和最漂亮的旅馆以及其他一些旅馆已经包下来专门接待代表们。在开会地点的前面和许多广场都张贴着用阿拉伯文、中文、俄文、英文和法文写的简明而动人的标语。在横跨尼罗河的尼罗河宫大桥两边飘扬着五彩缤纷的旗帜。
    亚非团结大会的开幕式和闭幕式预定在开罗大学大礼堂举行。全体会议的会议厅是前法鲁克王朝参议院。现在它是埃及国民议会所在地。就在这个在帝国主义统治时期少数人曾经对广大人民进行统治的场所，来自两大洲的几百位人民代表将共聚一堂，讨论加强对帝国主义的斗争。大厅里已经增设了座位，以便容纳所有代表、观察员和记者。大厅里配备了同时传译阿拉伯语、英语和法语的耳机。在每一位代表座位上都装有扩音器以便发表即席讲话。
    大会秘书处这几天来已经成了城内最热闹的一个地方。除了各代表团都到这里报到以外，它还接受关于各个代表团的消息以及世界各地发来的表示支持和祝贺大会的函电。记者们纷纷到那里去采访。到24日为止，秘书处已经签发了一百多张记者证。
    大会在最近已经成为这里报纸和观察家们注意的中心。埃及参加大会的代表团副团长、“晚报”总编辑哈立德·毛希丁在“晚报”上写道：“会议的目的之一是要使万隆原则成为亚非人民生活中不可分割的一部分。”他表示相信会议“将团结各国人民共同进行争取自由的斗争，并且把两洲的帝国主义势力永远消灭掉”。
    埃及报纸也报道了西方国家对这次大会的恐慌情绪。“晚报”援引纽约全国广播公司驻这里的记者的话说：“开罗在被选为即将举行的亚非团结大会地点后，已经成为另一个表示反对西方的榜样的场合……西方政治观察家把这次会议的召开称为打击西方帝国主义的季节。”
