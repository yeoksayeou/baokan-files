    Seriously and Earnestly Treat the Opinions of the Masses
　　*People's Daily* Commentator
    The slogan "Resolutely unleash, boldly unleash, thoroughly unleash" has stirred up the enthusiasm of the broad masses to offer opinions on leadership work and leadership style. Therefore, after the rectification campaign entered its third stage, most units successively launched upsurges of speaking out freely. Along with the upsurges of speaking out freely, many units also experienced upsurges of rectification and reform.

    However, some leading comrades in some units did not adopt a correct attitude towards the opinions of the masses. One is: they are not enthusiastic about solving problems, they do not solve problems that can be solved, and they do not handle opinions that can be handled. Some leave a large number of problems raised by the masses "for reference" without processing them. For example, the Tangshan Machine Factory classified 1,430 opinions raised by the masses (about one-third of the total number of opinions raised) as "for reference." Some do not seriously reply to the opinions raised by the masses, and even answer without understanding the original intentions of the masses. For example, the head of the administrative section of a unit "processed" more than 100 opinions raised by the masses in one hour, and as a result, half of the problems were returned by the masses. Some leaders respond to whatever practical or specific problems the masses raise with empty replies. For example, Liu Qian, deputy director of the Iron and Steel Research Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, replied to the opinions raised by the masses by saying: The opinions raised by everyone are correct, we humbly accept them, and we hope to continue to raise opinions in the future. Some leaders verbally express that they will resolutely reform, but take no action.

    This is obviously carrying out rectification and reform with a bureaucratic attitude. Everyone enthusiastically puts forward criticisms and opinions to the leadership, and boldly exposes the shortcomings and errors in the work, with the aim of hoping that the leadership can overcome the shortcomings and errors in work, thinking, and style through this rectification movement, so as to do a better job of revolutionary work. However, these leading comrades are self-enclosed and have no determination to thoroughly correct their own shortcomings and errors.

    Another is: regardless of whether the opinions raised by the masses are correct or not, whether they should be changed or not, or whether they can be changed or not, they are accepted without analysis and research, and changed blindly; or they only change what the masses raise, and do not care about similar problems. For example, in the Ministry of Public Security, someone suggested during the speaking out freely that there was no need to heat bathwater on Sundays. The general affairs department did not consider that this opinion only represented a part of the people living outside the ministry, and did not solicit the opinions of the majority of people living inside the ministry, so it rashly decided not to heat water on Sundays. As a result, many people were dissatisfied and posted big-character posters demanding restoration. Later, they had to change it back. A cadre of a central unit suggested that the light at a certain corner of the office building was broken. After seeing this big-character poster, the leading cadre immediately ordered the relevant department to install a new one. However, the masses were still not satisfied, because several streetlights in the building were broken, but the leadership did not conduct an inspection based on the problem raised by the big-character poster and solve them all at once.

    This attitude is certainly better than the bureaucratic attitude, but it is still not correct enough. Although these leading comrades show that they are very humble to the opinions of the masses, and change everything that can be changed, and change it very quickly, this kind of "treating the head when it hurts, and treating the foot when it hurts" piecemeal approach does not do much good to fundamentally overcoming the three bad styles and improving work. To correctly handle the opinions of the masses, the opinions of the masses should be carefully analyzed and studied. For the correct opinions of the masses, what should be changed and can be changed should be changed resolutely, boldly, and thoroughly. What should not be changed and cannot be changed but needs to be explained to the masses should be explained clearly in a timely manner. If you do not analyze or study them, and just muddle-headedly take them all in, change the wrong ones, and change the right ones, then you will not be able to distinguish right from wrong, and the responsibility will not be clear. Perhaps a problem of this nature will be solved today, and a problem of the same nature will appear tomorrow; an error will be corrected today, and the same error will be committed tomorrow; even the more you change, the more wrong you become, affecting the work and damaging the interests of the state. In fact, the opinions raised by the masses are not all completely correct, nor should it be required that the opinions raised by the masses are all completely correct. The problem lies in the fact that the leadership should analyze them and "choose the good ones and follow them."

    Neither bureaucracy nor blind rectification is the correct attitude to treat the opinions of the masses. The correct attitude should be a realistic attitude, an active attitude. A realistic attitude means that the opinions of the masses should be carefully analyzed and studied. For the correct opinions of the masses, the leaders should adopt the method of combining the leadership with the masses, study together with the masses, find out the causes of errors or shortcomings, find out practical and feasible improvement methods, and mobilize the masses to work together to change them. For the wrong opinions of the masses, they should be explained clearly to the masses, and they must not be blindly accepted, causing difficulties to the work. Why should we adopt a realistic attitude? Because the purpose of our rectification and reform is to truly change the style, improve the work, and improve the leadership and the masses, not to pander to the public or show off the percentage of rectification and reform. An active attitude means that rectification and reform should not stay at the level of the original opinions raised by the masses, nor should it be limited to a specific problem raised by the masses, but should be handled according to the different nature of the problems. What should be improved from the root cause should be improved from the root cause; what should be comprehensively checked and solved should be comprehensively solved, and the work should be actively improved.

    Treating the opinions raised by the masses in the speaking out freely in a realistic, serious, and earnest manner can not only enable leading cadres to clearly recognize the shortcomings and problems in their work and ideological style, and have the confidence and determination to overcome and solve them, but also improve the ability of leading cadres to analyze and judge things and their leadership level. For the masses, through such serious and earnest treatment, they can also receive profound education, improve their socialist consciousness, and further strengthen their sense of ownership, thereby more enthusiastically helping the leadership, supervising the leadership, and effectively overcoming the three bad styles.

    严肃认真地对待群众的意见
　　本报评论员
    “坚决地放，大胆地放，彻底地放”的口号，鼓起了广大群众对领导工作和领导作风提意见的热情，因而在整风转入第三阶段以后，一般单位都先后掀起了鸣放高潮。随着鸣放高潮，不少单位又出现了整改高潮。
    但是，有些单位的领导同志对待群众的意见没有采取正确的态度。一种是：对解决问题不热心，能够解决的问题不解决，能够处理的意见不处理。有的是把群众提出的大量问题，“留作参考”，不作处理，唐山机器厂就把群众提出的一千四百三十条意见（约占提出意见数的三分之一）划为“参考”。有的是不认真批复群众提出的意见，甚至连群众的原意都没弄清楚就作答复，如有个单位的行政科长，一个钟头就“处理”了群众提出的一百多条意见，结果有半数问题又被群众退了回来。有的是不管群众提的问题多么实际多么具体，他都用空洞的答复对之。如冶金部钢铁研究所副所长刘茜，对群众提的意见，他都答复说：大家提的意见是正确的，我们虚心接受，今后希望继续提意见。有的领导人是口头上表示要坚决改，但不见诸行动。
    这显然是以官僚主义的态度来进行整改。大家热情地向领导上提出批评和意见，大胆地揭露工作中的缺点和错误，其目的就是希望领导上能够通过这次整风运动，克服工作、思想、作风上的缺点和错误，把革命工作做得更好。而这些领导同志却故步自封，没有决心彻底改正自己的缺点和错误。
    另一种是：不管群众提出的意见对不对，应不应该改，能不能改，都不加分析研究地接受下来，盲目地加以改变；或者是群众提一点，就只改那一点，相似的问题也不去管。如公安部在鸣放中有人提出星期天不需要烧洗澡水，总务部门没有考虑这个意见只代表了住在部外的一部分人，也没有征求大多数住在部里的人的意见，就贸然决定星期天不烧水。结果引起许多人的不满，又贴大字报要求恢复，后来，又不得不改回来。中央有个单位的干部提出办公大楼某个拐角处电灯坏了，领导干部看见了这张大字报后立即叫有关部门去装好了。但是群众还是不满意，因为这个楼的好几处路灯都坏了，而领导上却没有根据那张大字报提出的问题进行一次检查一并加以解决。
    这种态度固然比官僚主义的态度要好一些，但还是不够端正。这些领导同志虽然对群众的意见表现得很虚心，能改的都改，并且改得很迅速，可是这种“头痛医头、脚痛医脚”零敲碎打的作法，对从根本上来克服三个坏主义、改进工作无多大好处。要正确处理群众意见，就应该对群众意见进行认真的分析、研究。对于群众的正确的意见，应该改、能够改的，就应该坚决、大胆、彻底地改。不应改不能改而需要向群众解释的就及时解释清楚。如果不加分析、研究，就稀里糊涂地包下来，错的也改，对的也改，就会是非不分，责任不明。也许今天解决了这样一个性质的问题，明天又会出现一个同样性质的问题；今天改正了这样一个错误，明天又会犯同样的错误；甚至愈改愈错，影响了工作又损害了国家利益。事实上群众提出的意见不完全都是正确的，也不应该要求群众提出的意见都完全正确，问题在于领导上要加以分析，“择其善者而从之”。
    不管是官僚主义还是盲目地整改，都不是正确地对待群众意见的态度。正确的态度应该是实事求是的态度，积极的态度。实事求是的态度就是对群众的意见要作认真的分析、研究。对于群众的正确的意见，领导者就应该采取领导与群众相结合的办法，和群众一齐研究，找出产生错误或缺点的原因，找出切实可行的改进办法，发动群众一起动手来改。对于群众的错误的意见，就应该向群众说清楚，决不能盲目接受，给工作造成困难。为什么要采取实事求是的态度？因为我们整改的目的是要真正改变作风、改进工作，提高领导提高群众，而不是为了哗众取宠，炫耀整改的百分比。积极的态度，就是整改不停留在群众原提意见的水平上，也不局限于群众所提出的某一具体问题，而是根据问题的不同性质处理。应该加以提高从根本上来考虑改进的，就从根本上来加以改进；应该进行全面检查通盘解决的就通盘解决，主动地改进工作。
    实事求是、认真严肃地处理群众在鸣放中提出的意见，不但可以使领导干部明确认识到自己工作中、思想作风上的缺点和问题，有信心有决心地去加以克服和解决，而且可以提高领导干部分析判断事物的能力和领导水平。对于群众来说，通过这样认真严肃的处理，也可以从中受到深刻的教育，提高社会主义觉悟，进一步加强主人翁的感觉，从而更加热心地帮助领导、监督领导有效地克服三个坏主义。
