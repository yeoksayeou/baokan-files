Xinhua News Agency, Cape Canaveral (United States), December 5th: After the Soviet Union launched two artificial satellites, the United States hastily decided to use the "Vanguard" rocket to launch a four-pound first experimental small artificial satellite, in preparation for launching an artificial satellite next year. This "Vanguard" rocket, which is no longer a pioneer, was originally scheduled to launch at 15:00 Greenwich time on November 4th, but it has not yet been launched. The launch time has been postponed six or seven times. American news agencies have reported that the wind is too strong or that there are technical difficulties. Currently, the time has been postponed to 21:00 Greenwich time on the 5th.

　　一再宣布延迟发射
    新华社5日讯卡纳维拉尔角（美国）消息：在苏联发射了两个人造卫星之后，美国急急忙忙决定用“先锋号”火箭来发射一个四磅重的第一个试验性的小人造卫星，为明年发射人造卫星作准备。这个早已不是先锋的“先锋号”火箭原定在11月4日格林威治时间十五点发射，可是直到目前还未发出。发射时间先后推迟了六、七次，美国的通讯社的报道一会儿说风太大，一会儿说技术困难。目前，时间推迟到5日格林威治时间二十一点。
