    Rat-Catching Jar
    Shu Wangcheng, the deputy director of Sima Agricultural Cooperative in Gubei Township, Jinzhai County, Anhui Province, is a first-class model worker in eliminating the four pests in Jinzhai County. During the movement to eliminate the four pests, he created many effective methods for catching rats and sparrows.
    He used a jar, filled it with half a jar of water, spread a layer of rice husks on top, and scattered a few grains of rice. He placed it in the room to catch rats. At night, the rats thought the jar was filled with grain, jumped in, and fell into the water. He used this method to catch eleven rats in one night. Now, the village where he lives has basically eliminated rats.

    捉鼠缸
    安徽金寨县古碑乡司马农业社副主任舒旺成，是金寨县一等除四害模范。在除四害运动中，他创造了许多有效的捕鼠捉雀办法。
    他利用一只缸，装半缸水，上面铺一层稻壳，撒几粒米，放在房间内捉老鼠。夜晚，老鼠以为缸里装的是粮食，往里一跳便掉在水中了，他用这个办法一夜捕了十一只老鼠。现在，他住的那个村子里已经基本上消灭了老鼠。
