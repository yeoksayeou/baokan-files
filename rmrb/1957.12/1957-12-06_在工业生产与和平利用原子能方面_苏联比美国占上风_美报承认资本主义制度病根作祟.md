Xinhua News Agency, 5th, Washington dispatch: American commentator Edson said on the 4th that the Soviet Union is "not only gaining the upper hand (over the United States) in industrial production, but it is also clear that they have already gained the upper hand."

Edson published an article in the Washington "News," entitled "The Development of Soviet Industry." In this article, he pointed out that the above conclusion is based on "Washington's detailed analysis of recent Soviet economic data." This analysis shows that the development of Soviet industry has a "leaping speed."

Edson said that the Soviet Union "is approaching the scale of the United States in the means of production—power station equipment and heavy machinery equipment—and in the amount of steel used. As for machine tools, it manufactured more machine tools than the United States last year; at the same time, the value of this product exceeded the United States by 25%."

Edson also said: "The Soviet Union's plan to expand the steel industry has caused great anxiety to American economists."

Important newspapers and periodicals such as "Time" magazine and "U.S. News & World Report" have also recently published commentaries and news discussing the scale of Soviet industrial development. The "New York Times" said in an editorial that because "the Soviet Union has abundant human and material resources, there is no reason to doubt that it will continue to make progress in economic strength."

Xinhua News Agency, 5th, New York dispatch from TASS on the 4th: The American "Newsweek" magazine, in its issue of the 9th which was published in advance, admitted that the United States has fallen behind the Soviet Union in the construction of atomic energy power stations for peaceful purposes.

The magazine wrote that because the peaceful use of atomic energy cannot bring enough high profits, some American companies have begun to avoid using atomic energy commercially. Not long ago, twenty-nine of the thirty atomic energy engineers at Bell Aircraft Company were laid off, Pandex Aircraft Company refused to accept orders from some universities to build a batch of small reactors, and American Machine & Foundry Company and Foster Wheeler Corporation abandoned orders to build reactors for certain power cooperatives in Minnesota and Michigan.

The magazine pointed out that the question of the peaceful use of atomic energy depends on: "Whether American monopolists, who are linked by blood to old power sources, can find a profitable way in the peaceful use of atomic energy; whether American capitalist society can truly utilize the huge new source of power opened up by the development of nuclear energy in the current stage of development. Some observers believe that the facts of recent years have given a negative answer."

### 在工业生产与和平利用原子能方面　苏联比美国占上风  美报承认资本主义制度病根作祟

　  在工业生产与和平利用原子能方面
　　苏联比美国占上风
    美报承认资本主义制度病根作祟
    新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：美国评论员埃德逊4日说，苏联“在工业生产方面不仅正在（比美国）占上风，而且很明显，他们已经占了上风。”
    埃德逊在华盛顿“新闻报”上发表文章，题目是“苏联工业的发展”。在这篇文章里，他指出，上述这个结论的根据是“华盛顿对最近的苏联经济资料所作的详尽分析”。这个分析表明，苏联工业的发展具有“飞跃的速度”。
    埃德逊说，苏联“在生产资料——电站企业设备和重型机器设备——以及用钢量等方面，都正在接近美国的规模。至于机床，它在去年制造的机床就比美国多；同时，这种产品的价值超过了美国25％。”
    埃德逊还说：“苏联扩大炼钢工业的计划已经使美国的经济学家感到极大的不安。”
    “时代”周刊和“美国新闻与世界报道”等等重要报刊最近也纷纷发表评论和消息，谈论苏联工业发展的规模。“纽约时报”在一篇社论中说，因为“苏联拥有丰富的人力和物力，没有理由怀疑它在经济力量方面将要继续取得进展”。
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社纽约4日讯：提前出版的9日的一期美国“新闻周刊”承认，在建造和平用途的原子能发电站方面，美国已经落在苏联的后面。
    这家杂志写道，由于和平利用原子能不能带来足够的高额利润，所以美国有些公司已经开始避免在商业上使用原子能。不久以前，贝尔飞机公司的三十个原子能工程师中有二十九人被解雇，潘迪克斯飞机公司拒绝接受一些大学建造一批小型反应堆的定货，而美国机器制造和翻砂公司和福斯特惠勒公司放弃了为明尼苏达州和密执安州某些动力合作组织建造反应堆的定货。
    杂志指出，关于和平利用原子能的问题取决于：“同旧的动力来源血脉相连的美国垄断资本家在和平利用原子能方面是否能找到有利可图的门径；美国资本主义社会在现阶段的发展中是否可能真正地利用由于核子能的发展而开辟的巨大的新动力源泉。某些观察家认为，最近几年来的事实作了否定的答复”。
