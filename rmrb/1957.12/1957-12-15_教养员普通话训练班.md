　　Mandarin Training Class for Kindergarten Teachers
    (Our newspaper reports) This year, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has successively held six Mandarin training classes for kindergarten teachers in eighteen districts of the city, including Xincheng and Zhabei, with a total of more than 1,500 participants. Through learning the pronunciation of phonetic alphabets, Pinyin, tones, and some educational and teaching terms, they gradually learned Mandarin. After eight to ten days of study, most students could correctly pronounce standard syllables spelled with phonetic alphabets. Among these students, 92% scored 70 points or higher in the examination. Kindergarten teachers using phonetic alphabets to further improve their Mandarin will enable them to educate young children in Mandarin. (Yang Juchen)

　　教养员普通话训练班
    本报讯　今年上海市教育局先后在本市新成、闸北等十八个区分块联合举办了六个幼儿园教养员普通话训练班，参加学习的共一千五百多人。她们通过拼音字母的发音、拼音、字调和一些教育教养用语的学习，逐步学会普通话。经过八至十天的学习，大多数学员看到用拼音字母拼成的标准音节，就能正确发音。这些学员的考试成绩，在七十分以上的占92％。教养员们运用拼音字母，来进一步说好普通话，这就可以用普通话来教育幼儿。　（杨居辰）
