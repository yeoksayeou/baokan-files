    Heading Down a Dead End
    French General Paul Géréald opposes the establishment of missile launch sites in France because he knows that it would put France in danger of destruction. However, he advocates establishing missile launch sites in northern Sahara. It is said that the medium-range missiles there will potentially put "all of Russia under a hail of fire," while "Russian retaliatory fire will be directed at the most desolate regions of Africa."
    It sounds like a brilliant plan. But the question arises: when France uses missiles to launch at the Soviet Union, will France not be retaliated against simply because the base is located in the Sahara? General Géréald cannot avoid this question, so he has to admit that his proposal is not completely flawless.
    In fact, a flawless proposal is readily available. It was proposed long ago in the Soviet Union's peace initiatives. General Géréald stubbornly refuses to agree to end the "Cold War," and although he racks his brains, he only heads down a dead end, and can never extricate France from the danger of being destroyed.

    往死路里钻
    法国的保罗·热腊尔多将军反对在法国设置导弹发射台，因为他知道这会使法国遭到毁灭的危险。但是，他主张在撒哈拉北部设立导弹发射台。据说，在那里的中程导弹将可能使“俄罗斯全境置于火网之下”，而“俄国的反击炮火将指向非洲最荒漠的地区”。
    听来似乎是条绝妙的好计。不过问题来了：当法国使用导弹向苏联发射的时候，难道仅仅因为基地设在撒哈拉，法国就不会受到反击了吗？热腊尔多将军无法回避这个问题，因此他也不得不承认，他的主张并不是完备无缺的。
    其实，完备无缺的主张是现成的。在苏联的和平倡议里早就提出来了。热腊尔多将军硬不赞成结束“冷战”，尽管他绞尽脑汁，结果只是往死路里钻，决不能使法国摆脱遭受毁灭的危险。
