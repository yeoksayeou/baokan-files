    Waste Material Made into Fertilizer
    The Shanghai Public-Private Joint Venture Dafeng Chemical Plant has achieved initial success in trial-producing fertilizer using waste materials. The plant's main product is nitrocellulose. In the past, a large amount of nitric acid escaped into the atmosphere during the production process, and a considerable amount of wastewater and waste residue containing small amounts of nitric acid were also poured into the Huangpu River. Since the promulgation of the draft National Agricultural Development Program, the plant has successfully trial-produced a good nitrogen fertilizer, calcium nitrate (containing 13% nitrogen), from these waste materials. If waste materials can be utilized to the greatest extent possible, the annual output of nitrogen fertilizer can reach more than 300 tons.

    废料制成了化肥
    上海公私合营达丰化工厂利用废料试制化肥初步成功。该厂主要产品为硝化纤维素，以往在生产过程中有大量硝气逃入大气中，还有不少废水，废脚中含有的少量硝酸也都曾倾入黄浦江里。自农业发展纲要草案公布后，该厂将这些废料试制成功一种很好的氮肥硝酸钙（含氮量达13％）。如废料能尽量利用，氮肥年产量可达三百多吨。
