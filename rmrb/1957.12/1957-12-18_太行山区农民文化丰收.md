    Taihang Mountains Area
    Farmers' Cultural Harvest
    After agricultural collectivization, the Taihang Mountains area witnessed a cultural learning boom along with the bumper harvest in agriculture.
    This year, the whole area has opened 7,640 people's schools, accounting for 88% of the number of villages (including natural small mountain villages). More than 540,000 farmers participated in literacy classes. By the end of October, more than 23,000 people had graduated. Since 1954, a total of more than 260,000 people have been freed from illiteracy, and 28 villages, including Xigou in Pingshun County, have emerged as villages without illiteracy, thereby changing the situation of many illiterates and cultural backwardness in rural areas to varying degrees. Xigou in Pingshun is the poorest small mountain village in the entire region. Before liberation, only three farmers were literate, but now it has become a village without illiteracy. Li Shunda and Shen Jilan, the nationally famous agricultural labor models, had never attended school for a single day when they were young, but now they can not only read newspapers but also write very fluent summary reports. Among the graduates of the literacy campaign in the village, six have become township and commune cadres, and fifteen have become work recorders and newspaper readers. The improvement of the cultural level of the vast number of farmers has powerfully promoted agricultural production and various other tasks.　　　　　(Zhao Dechang)

    太行山区
    农民文化丰收
    太行山区在农业合作化以后，随着农业大丰收出现了文化学习的丰收。
    今年，全区开办了民校七千六百四十所，占村数（包括自然小山庄）的88％，参加扫盲学习的农民共有五十四万多人，到10月底统计，已毕业二万三千多人。从1954年开始到现在共有二十六万多人摆脱了文盲状态，并出现了平顺县西沟等二十八个无盲村，从而程度不同地改变了农村文盲多和文化落后的状况。平顺西沟是全区条件最差的一个小山庄，解放前只有三个农民识字，到现在成了无盲村。全国著名的农业劳动模范李顺达和申纪兰从小就没有念过一天书，现在不仅能看报纸，并且能写出非常通顺的总结报告。该村扫盲毕业的学员中当了乡、社干部的六人，记工员、读报员十五人。由于广大农民文化水平的提高，有力地推动了农业生产和各项工作。　　　　　（赵德昌）
