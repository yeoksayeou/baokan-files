    Going to Heaven and Entering the Earth
    A news report says that Soviet rockets can not only go to heaven but also enter the earth. Soviet scientists have used the principles of rocket technology to create a jet-powered thermal drilling device, and it has been successfully used. This shows that Soviet rocket technology has made even greater progress.
    However, to this day, the American rockets, which boast of being "pioneering," cannot launch a small iron ball weighing 1.5 kilograms into the sky. When Soviet rockets already have a way to enter the earth, American rockets still have no way to go to heaven.
    The Soviet Union's advancement and the United States' backwardness are by no means accidental events; the problem lies in the social system itself.

    上天和入地
    报载：苏联火箭不仅能上天，也能入地。苏联科学家已利用火箭技术原理制成了一种喷气热力钻探装置，并且已成功地在使用。这说明苏联的火箭技术，百尺竿头更进了一步。
    然而，直到今天，自吹为“先锋”的美国火箭还无法把一个一点五公斤重的小铁球发射到天上去。当苏联火箭已经入地有门的时候，美国火箭仍然上天无路哩。
    苏联的先进，美国的落后，绝不是偶然的事件，问题在于社会制度的本身。
