　  Lament from the Cabinet (A dazibao from a certain government agency)
    A rush of blood to the head, orders to report summaries, annual, quarterly, and special reports
    ——None can be missing! Better not to send them at all,
    But if sent, no one reads them. A mountain of problems is put forward
    ——Who will solve them? Exhausting heart and soul
    Ink and paper become waste scraps, pitifully locked in an iron cabinet year after year
    ——Empty sorrow!
                  (Jianmin)

　  柜中怨（某机关的一张大字报）脑子一阵热，布置报总结，年度月季和专题
    ——不许缺！不送倒还好，
  送来没人阅。问题摆出一大堆
    ——谁解决？费尽心与血
  纸墨变废屑，可怜长年锁铁柜
      ——空悲切！
                  （健民）
