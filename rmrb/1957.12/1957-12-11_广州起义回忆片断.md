　　Guangzhou Uprising: Fragments of Recollection
　　Yiming
    Editor's Note: Today is the 30th anniversary of the Guangzhou Uprising. We have excerpted some fragments about the uprising from a booklet titled "Guangzhou Commune," published in 1930 by the "Proletarian Bookstore." The author was a participant in the uprising. The original text was not signed. The editors of this journal have slightly modified the text.
    On December 4, 1927, two hundred active members of the Training Regiment held a secret meeting in the suburbs of Guangzhou and listened to a report from the Party representative. At the meeting, everyone unanimously advocated for an uprising, and thereafter they asked every day: "When will the uprising happen?"
    On the 7th, eighty representatives from labor unions convened another secret meeting, which was guarded by the Red Guards. The meeting passed a resolution for an immediate armed uprising, and nine workers were elected as representatives to the Guangzhou Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Soviet. Three peasants and three soldiers were also selected, thus establishing a fifteen-member Soviet.
    On the evening of December 10th, the Red Guards gradually gathered at the houses designated by the Trade Union. At that time, there was complete silence, otherwise the entire plan would be destroyed by the reactionary military police. However, ninety Red Guards and sixty bombs were discovered by the enemy, who immediately took measures. Two armored cars patrolled the streets in turns, and checkpoints were added to every key intersection in the city, inspecting pedestrians.
    What to do? The command issued an order: resolutely execute the original plan. If attacked, resist immediately.
    The most important moment arrived! Ah! This time of life and death! For some reason, around twelve o'clock midnight, the police quieted down. At 3:30 AM on the 11th, a burst of gunfire, one after another, came from the direction of the Training Regiment's barracks, followed by a noisy clamor of people. It turned out that buses had transported the soldiers of the Training Regiment into the city. The silent night of Guangzhou was broken by the sound of gunfire and people's voices.
    After enthusiastic speeches by Comrade Zhang Tailei, a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and organizer of the uprising, as well as other Soviet representatives and Red Guard representatives, the entire regiment of soldiers immediately executed fifteen reactionary officers by shooting, sincerely swearing to overthrow the Kuomintang government and obey the orders of the Guangdong Soviet; amid enthusiastic shouts of "Uprising!" they unfurled the large red flag with the axe and sickle and marched towards the assigned battle locations of each company according to the planned routes. At the same time, thousands of worker Red Guards, holding red flags, wearing red belts, and red armbands, with rifle-wielding and grenade-carrying members at the front, and those holding knives and axes or unarmed following behind, departed in formations to the pre-arranged locations, gunfire erupted, and shouts shook the sky, marking the official start of "an unprecedented great change in Chinese history" – the worker-peasant-soldier uprising.
    At 6:00 AM on the 11th, the Guangdong Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Soviet was already operating in the Public Security Bureau. The headquarters of the Red Army and Red Guards was also located there. Workers gathered in front of the headquarters, surrounded by several layers of citizens. Trucks fully loaded with firearms and ammunition constantly shuttled back and forth, emptying upon arrival. Weapons reached the hands of the insurgent workers. From six in the morning until noon, more than eight thousand firearms were distributed. Over a thousand political prisoners were released from prisons.
    Propaganda teams were formed, consisting of students and young women. They were given two armored vehicles. They held high the red flag and started working from nine in the morning, shouting slogans and distributing leaflets. The army needed food. Food service points were also established, and female workers who couldn't participate in combat managed these food service points. Thus, on the streets, one could see biscuit trucks escorted by female comrades driving alongside trucks loaded with military supplies and uniforms. A large quantity of biscuits was found in large warehouses, and the uprising troops mainly ate these biscuits that day.
    On the second day of the occupation of Guangzhou, two hundred peasant soldiers came from Fangzhuang, and about three hundred peasants came from Fangshan. The Fangshan peasant brothers were famous not only because they were fellow villagers of Hong Xiuquan, the leader of the Taiping Rebellion, but also because they were peasants who had struggled against landlords. The arrival of the peasant brothers greatly excited the Guangzhou workers who were engaged in a heroic struggle.
    After the failure of the uprising, reactionary troops besieged the Soviet government like ants, but everyone trembled and dared not enter; because a large red flag with an axe and sickle still fluttered in the wind on the roof, and they didn't know that this large red flag was still sheltering many working masses! They had to set up cannons to shoot down this large red flag, and only after the flag was shot down by artillery fire did some of them dare to poke their heads inside to investigate.
    Ruling classes and their running dogs, listen: The large red flag with the axe and sickle has been flying for ten years on one-sixth of the world's territory! It also waved in Guangzhou for three days! It will forever wave in the hearts of the world's proletariat and oppressed peoples! Scare you to death! Let you tremble!

　　广州起义回忆片断
　　佚名
    编者按：今天是广州起义三十周年纪念。我们从一本1930年“无产阶级书店”出版的“广州公社”的小册子上，摘录一些有关起义的片断。作者是起义的参加者。原文没有署名。本刊编者在文字上略加修改。
    1927年12月4日教导团的两百个积极分子，在广州的郊外开了一个秘密会议，听了党代表的报告。会上，大家一致主张暴动，此后他们就天天问：“什么时候暴动呀？”
    7日，八十个工会的代表又召集了一个秘密会议，这会议是由赤卫队保卫的。会上通过了立即武装暴动的决议，九个工人被选为广州工农兵代表苏维埃的代表。农民和兵士各选三人，这样，就成立了十五人的苏维埃。
    12月10日晚上七时，赤卫队逐渐集合于职工会指定的房子里。当时肃静无声，否则全盘计划就要被反动派的军警破坏。但是，还是有九十个赤卫队和六十个炸弹，被敌人查出了，敌人立刻采取了措施，二架铁甲车轮流巡视街道，城里各个要道口，都加了岗哨，检查行人。
    怎么办？指挥部下令：坚决执行原定计划。如遇袭击，即行反抗。
    最重要的时间到了！呵！这样的生死关头的时间呵！不知什么原因，深夜十二时左右，警察安静下去了。11日清晨三时三十分，从教导团的营房方面，传来了一阵紧一阵的枪声，接着，又听得了人声嘈杂，汹涌而来。原来公共汽车把教导团的兵载到城里来了。广州市的沉寂的夜被枪声和人声惊破了。
    教导团全团士兵，在中国共产党中央委员、起义组织者张太雷同志及其他苏维埃代表赤卫队代表的热烈的讲演以后，当场枪杀反动军官十五人，竭诚宣誓推翻国民党政府和服从广东苏维埃的命令；在热烈的“暴动呵”欢呼声中展开斧头镰刀大红旗，按照预定计划走向各连分配的作战地点。同时，几千工人赤卫队，撑起红旗，围着红领带，带着红领章，持步枪手榴弹者当前，持刀斧徒手者随后，一队队地，按着预定地点出发，枪弹声大作，呼喊震天，“中国历史上的空前大变”——工农兵起义正式开始了。
    11日晨六时，广东工农兵代表苏维埃即在公安局办公。红军及赤卫队司令部亦在那里。工人集合在司令部前面，四面密密地围了好几层市民。满装枪械子弹的汽车不断地往来，汽车随到随空。武器都到了起义的工人手里，从晨六时至中午散发了八千枪枝以上。从监狱放出了一千以上的政治犯。
    宣传队组成了，其中都是学生与少女。给了他们两架铁甲车。他们高举红旗自晨九时起开始工作，他们高呼口号及发散传单。军队是要供给粮食的。饮食处也组成了，女工不能参加战斗的，便由她们管理这些饮食处。于是，在大街上，人们就看见由女同志护送的饼干车就与装军械军装的汽车并驾齐驱。那大量的饼干就是从大堆栈中搜来的，这天，起义的部队主要的就吃这饼干。
    广州占领的第二天，从芳庄来了二百农民军，从芳山来了三百左右农民。芳山的农民弟兄，不仅因为是太平暴动首领洪秀全的乡人而著名，而且因为他们是和地主斗争过的农民。农民弟兄一来，使在英勇的斗争中的广州工人，得到很大的兴奋。
    起义失败后，反动军队蜂蚁般的包围着苏维埃政府，但大家都抖颤着不敢进去；因为房顶上还随风招展着一面斧头镰刀大红旗，他们不知道这一面大红旗下还掩护着好些劳苦群众！他们只好架炮来打这面大红旗，直到这旗被炮火打倒了，他们中有些人才敢向里面去伸头探脑。
    统治阶级及其走狗们听着：斧子镰刀大红旗在世界六分之一面积的领土上已经飘扬了十年！在广州城内也招展了三天！在全世界无产阶级及被压迫民族的心目中永远招展着！吓死你们！让你们颤抖吧！
