　　Apprenticeship System Indeed Needs Revision
　　By our reporters Ji Yin, Xi Ping

　　The current apprenticeship system in factories and enterprises indeed has many shortcomings and needs revision. Recently, we visited some cadres and workers from the Shanghai Boiler Factory, Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, and Shanghai Tool Factory to discuss this issue. After discussion, everyone believed that the current apprenticeship system in factories mainly has the following four problems:

　　Too Short Training Period Limits the Improvement of Technical Level

　　In the past few years, many factories in Shanghai have adopted a "fast training method" for apprentices. The training period ranged from a year for a long one, to three months for a short one, and even a few weeks, to train apprentices into skilled workers. For example, the Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory recruited more than 200 new workers last year, and they all became third-grade skilled workers after three months. Adopting this approach had objective reasons at the time. That is, the factory's production developed rapidly, skilled workers were lacking, and a large number of workers were transferred to support construction in other areas. Without quickly training workers, the needs of production and construction could not be met.

　　However, a short training period has significant drawbacks. The main one is that after these people become formal workers, their technical level is generally low, and they lack the ability to work independently, often leading to various accidents such as damage to equipment and tools, and defective products. We investigated the situation of responsibility accidents in several factories, and the proportion of young apprentices and young workers was the largest. For example, in the Shanghai Tool Factory, among the more than 400 responsibility accidents of machine tool equipment last year, 85% were caused by new workers below the third grade. In several factories such as the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, many major equipment damage accidents have occurred this year due to the lack of operational experience of young workers, causing great losses to the factory.

　　Due to the short training time, factories have to adopt professional training methods to train technicians, and apprentices have very narrow access to technology. For example, if training a lathe operator, what he learns is only one or two processes of one type of lathe. After the training period expires, although he has been rated as a third- or fourth-grade worker, he does not actually possess the technical level that a third- or fourth-grade worker should have. Often, those who learn to use small lathes will not use large lathes, hexagonal lathes, and other lathes. Those who learn to turn internal circles will not turn external circles and other processes. They can not only fail to master multi-skill technologies, but also fail to fully master various technologies of one skill. This situation brings great difficulties to the internal labor allocation of the factory and causes enormous waste. For example, in the Shanghai Boiler Factory, which produces small batches of individual products, the types of work are very unbalanced in daily production. Sometimes lathe operators are very busy while planing workers are very idle, and sometimes planing workers may have a lot of work while milling workers have nothing to do. In this case, experienced workers who master multiple skills can adapt to production changes, while general new workers cannot. Many factories often have this strange phenomenon: on the one hand, a large number of temporary technicians are transferred from outside the factory to help, and on the other hand, a large number of workers in the factory are idle and have nothing to do.

　　To enable new workers to master one or several types of work techniques more comprehensively and skillfully, it is necessary to extend the training time.

　　Here, it is necessary to revise the standards for assessing technicians by industrial departments. In the past, industrial departments excessively and prematurely emphasized the specialization and singularization of technology, which was a manifestation of being divorced from China's actual situation. There are many small and medium-sized enterprises in China, and products change and are not fixed. The state also requires factories and enterprises to implement multi-variety production and continuously expand new varieties. This correspondingly requires workers to master as many types of work skills as possible, or to master various technologies of one type of work, and to improve the proficiency of technology. In fact, this is also the requirement of apprentices. Now in many factories, the types of work are unnecessarily divided too finely. In the case of multi-variety production, this will only cause waste and affect the improvement of workers' technical level. The Shanghai Machine Tool Factory has more than 60 types of work. According to comrades in the workshop, many types of work can be completely merged. For example, scraping workers and assemblers, scribers and fitters, can be done by one worker. If they are rigidly separated, you can only do this process and wait for others to take over another process, waiting for each other, and manpower will be wasted.

　　High Apprentice Pay is Detrimental to Both the State and the Individual

　　The high material treatment of apprentices is another important defect in the current apprenticeship system. According to regulations, the apprentices of several factories such as Shanghai Machine Tool Factory and Tool Factory have three kinds of allowances: 24 yuan, 30 yuan, and 39 yuan per month. But according to our investigation, most apprentices in these factories now get 39 yuan, very few get 30 yuan, and almost none get 24 yuan. They are only three yuan less than the first-grade formal workers (42 yuan). In addition to personal food expenses of 12 to 14 yuan, they can have a surplus of 25 to 27 yuan per month. In fact, this is no longer the nature of a living allowance, but a low wage. In the recent blooming and contending campaign, farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai had many opinions on the excessively high income of apprentices. The average annual income of farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai is 99 yuan (29 yuan more than the national average farmer income), equivalent to 8 yuan and 25 cents per month, which is less than a quarter of the apprentice's income. Many apprentices in Shanghai factories are young people from the suburbs. They enter the factory for a few months and have not yet become formal workers, but their income is several times higher than that of farmers, which is obviously extremely unreasonable.

　　Most apprentices have no family burden, so their actual income is generally higher than that of older workers, and their lives are more affluent than those of older workers. The task of apprentices in the factory is to learn. They have not yet become formal workers and cannot produce material wealth for the country, but their lives are more affluent than those of older workers, and the older workers are not satisfied.

　　Earning too much before officially participating in labor also has many disadvantages for young people who do not yet know how to handle their lives carefully. The situation of young apprentices eating and using recklessly and living extravagantly is extremely common. Some people were relatively simple when they entered the factory, but soon changed. One young apprentice had a life schedule: two ice cream bars every day, three to five movies a week, and the rest of the time was spent skating, dancing, and swimming. They were ashamed of hard work and simplicity and proud of extravagance and waste. Their first plan after entering the factory was to buy watches, woolen pants, accordions, bicycles, etc. Gambling all night is common in the apprentice dormitory of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory. Some people lost all their money and spent it all, so they engaged in theft. From January to October this year, the factory solved 23 theft cases, of which 21 were done by young apprentices.

　　Too much money cannot encourage apprentices to be progressive. In order to allow apprentices to study well, the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory stipulates that apprentices should not take the factory's shuttle bus to and from work during normal times, but stay in the factory for accommodation and go home on Sundays. This allows them to use the evening time to take technical or political classes. However, many apprentices spend six yuan to buy a monthly ticket and automatically take the bus away as soon as they get off work, unwilling to stay in the factory to study, especially unwilling to study politics. In some factories, there is a saying circulating among apprentices: "Study X (technology), strive for a red pass (referring to the preferential treatment certificate for senior intellectuals), hate Marx (politics)." Many apprentices have a strong sense of economism and a purely technical viewpoint. They not only refuse to study politics, but also only want to learn easy technology that they think is promising, and refuse to learn laborious and dirty technology.

　　The growth of various bad tendencies among young apprentices has complex social reasons, especially related to the weakness of the enterprise's political and ideological work, but the unreasonable allowance system that exceeds the general social living standard undoubtedly plays a role in fueling this tendency. A comrade from the Youth League Committee of the Boiler Factory said, "We are constantly telling them to be hardworking and simple, but in fact they have a lot of money in their pockets and are always planning to find a way out for it!"

　　There Should Also Be the Cultivation of Labor Quality

　　The current factory apprenticeship system also has a tendency of purely technical viewpoints, and does not list the exercise of physical labor and the cultivation of the ideological qualities of hard work and diligence as an important task for apprentices. This is also a fundamental defect. The idea that apprentices in the factory do not want to engage in physical labor but only want to learn technology is quite common. They say, "I am here to learn technology, I won't do work that doesn't involve technology." If the master asks him to get materials in the warehouse, he will not go. If the master asks him to clean the machine, he will not do it. When the workshop is cleaning, he sneaks away. Old workers shake their heads when they look at these young people, saying that they are "young masters" and "they are truly liberated."

　　Due to the short-term "fast training method" implemented in factories in the past, apprentices had very few opportunities to engage in daily physical labor. They often entered the workshop as soon as they entered the factory, determined their type of work, and then learned technology on the lathe under the guidance of the master, or learned technology in the classroom. After a few months, they took the exam. If both the "knowledge" and "skills" passed, they would be promoted to formal workers, and many people jumped to the third or even fourth grade workers. This speed inevitably makes some people dizzy.

　　From the situation of these factories in Shanghai, it can be seen that the composition of factory apprentices has changed greatly. First of all, the number of students has increased, especially the number of middle school students is increasing. It is a good thing that apprentices have a high level of education. They learn technology quickly and have a strong understanding ability. But there is also a bad side, that is, they are mostly infected with a relatively strong idea of despising physical labor from the exploiting classes. They have a heavy "scholarly atmosphere," are aloof and proud, lack the habit of physical labor, and look down on masters who have less education but have labor experience. Secondly, the family composition of apprentices has also changed greatly. The number of children from capitalist, landlord, and various petty-bourgeois families among apprentices is increasing day by day. These people, of course, bring more dirty things from the exploiting classes. The above-mentioned spread of various bad tendencies such as contempt for physical labor among current factory apprentices is related to this change in the composition of apprentices. This situation requires the current factory apprenticeship system to emphasize the exercise of physical labor and the cultivation of the ideological qualities of diligence and thrift. Old workers say well that young people who have just entered the factory are like a small grass that has just emerged from the soil. Spoiling them in every possible way will only harm them. Letting them suffer more hardships and be exposed to more wind and rain at the beginning will make them better when they grow up. These words are the experience of the old workers and a concrete manifestation of their concern for their successors.

　　Strengthening physical labor exercise and extending the apprenticeship learning time are related. The specific opinions of some comrades in the factory are: in the future, after apprentices enter the factory, they should not first determine the type of work or immediately go to the workshop to learn technology, but should first let them participate in various auxiliary labor within the factory, including odd jobs, porters, cleaners, etc., and take this "labor lesson" as their first lesson in the factory, and then go to the workshop to learn technology after a certain period of time (such as half a year or a year). In short, during the apprenticeship period, they should change their habits and concepts of despising labor, so as to truly train them into a new type of worker who has both culture and loves labor in the future.

　　The "Package Deal" Method Cannot Encourage Enterprises to Recruit Apprentices

　　The current factory apprenticeship system adopts a uniform "package deal" method for apprentices, that is, regardless of whether the apprentice's academic performance is good or bad, as long as he has stepped into the factory door and has not made major mistakes during the apprenticeship period, the factory must hire him after the apprenticeship period expires. The facts of the past few years have proved that this system also has shortcomings. It cannot effectively encourage apprentices' enthusiasm for learning, and if it is not handled well, it often burdens the factory. These factories all have this situation: some apprentices have very poor academic performance, bad character, and a very bad influence, becoming "bad apples" among young people, but they are not qualified to be expelled, so the factory has to hire them anyway. There are also some apprentices who, after entering the factory, find that they are either physically ill or for other reasons, they are simply not qualified to work, and the factory has to allocate other jobs to them. The Shanghai Machine Tool Factory had several people who had to be placed in the office to work as clerks. Three or four apprentices who entered the Shanghai Tool Factory last year were not in good health to begin with. They got sick as soon as they entered the factory. For more than a year, the factory paid them an allowance of more than 30 yuan per month and also paid for all their medical expenses. Their families also enjoyed labor insurance benefits as a result. He has not worked for a single day and has made no contribution to the country, but the factory has to support him in this way for a long time. Now many small and medium-sized factories and handicraft cooperatives dare not recruit apprentices, a big reason is that they are afraid of this "package deal" system. Their family background is small and they cannot bear the "burden."

　　So how should the "package deal" system be revised? People believe that it can be replaced by the method of signing apprenticeship contracts, that is, apprentices sign a contract with the factory before entering the factory, stating that the factory has the right to select apprentices to enter the factory to work according to the merits of the apprentices' academic performance after the apprenticeship period expires; if there are other reasons, it may also refuse to hire them. This approach can improve the enthusiasm of factories and enterprises to absorb apprentices, and can also promote apprentices to study actively. Technical schools that train apprentices can also consider revising the current "package deal" method. Those with good family economic conditions do not necessarily have to enjoy public funding, but can implement partial or full self-funding. Factories can also choose students based on the merits of their academic performance after graduation.

　　Revise the Apprenticeship System According to the View of "Overall Planning and Comprehensive Arrangement"

　　Chairman Mao taught us in his speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people: When we make plans, do things, and think about problems, we must start from the fact that China has 600 million people, and we must start from the perspective of overall planning and comprehensive arrangement for all the people. Today, regarding the issue of the apprenticeship system, we need to re-examine and revise it based on this viewpoint. People believe that the emergence of many shortcomings in the current factory apprenticeship system is fundamentally due to the fact that it violates this viewpoint, is divorced from China's actual situation of a large population and economic backwardness, and has not absorbed some of the advantages of China's past apprenticeship system that are suitable for China's national conditions. Recently, the State Council promulgated the draft interim provisions on the length of study and living allowances for apprentices in state-owned, joint state-private, cooperative, and individual enterprises and institutions. Many comrades in the factory expressed their support, believing that some of the methods proposed in it embody the spirit of overall planning, comprehensive consideration, and building the country through diligence and thrift.

　　学徒制度确实需要修改
　　本报记者　季音　习平
    工厂企业现行的学徒制度确实存在许多缺陷，需要修改。最近，我们就这个问题，先后访问了上海锅炉厂、上海机床厂、上海工具厂的一些干部和工人。大家讨论的结果，认为工厂现行的学徒制度中，主要存在下面四个问题：
    学习期限太短，限制了技术水平的提高
    上海的许多工厂在过去几年中，对学徒的培养都采取了“快速培养法”。时间长的一年，短的三个月，甚至几个星期，就把学徒培养成技术工人。像上海矿山机器厂去年招收了二百多名新工人，三个月之后就都成了三级技术工人。采取这种做法在当时是有客观原因的。这就是工厂的生产发展很快，技术工人缺，同时又调大批工人支援外地建设，不快速培养工人就不能满足生产建设的需要。
    但学习期限过短有很大缺点，主要的是这些人转为正式工人之后，技术水平大都很低，缺乏独立工作能力，以致常常发生损坏设备工具、出废次品等种种事故。我们调查了几个工厂的责任事故的情况，青年艺徒和青工占的比重最大。如上海工具厂去年发生的四百多件机床设备的责任事故中，由三级以下的新工人造成的占85％。上海机床厂等几个工厂里，今年都由于青工缺乏操作经验，接连发生了好多件重大的设备损坏事故，给工厂造成极大损失。
    由于学习时间过短，工厂培养技工不得不采取专业培养的方法，徒工接触技术的面非常狭窄。譬如培养一个车工，他所学的仅仅是一种车床的一、二种工序，学习期满之后，虽然已被评为三级或四级工人，但实际上并不具备一个三、四级工人所应有的技术水平。常常是学习使用小车床的，就不会使用大车床、六角车床等等其它车床。学习车内圆的，就不会车外圆等其他工序。他们不但不能掌握多工种技术，就是一个工种的各种技术也不能完全掌握。这种情况，给工厂内部劳动力的调配带来很大困难，造成莫大的浪费。如单个小批生产的上海锅炉厂，在日常生产中，工种之间很不平衡，有时候车工很忙，刨工很空，有时又可能刨工活多，而铣工没活干。在这种情况下，掌握多种技术的老工人就能适应生产的变化，一般新工人就不行。许多工厂常常出现这种怪现象：一方面向厂外大批调请临时技工来帮助，另一方面本厂又有大批工人闲着没活做。
    要使新工人比较全面而熟练地掌握一种或几种工种的技术，就必须延长学习时间。
    这里，需要修改工业部门对技工进行考核的标准。过去，工业部门过分地、过早地强调技术的专业化，单一化，这是脱离我国实际情况的一种表现。我国中小型企业为数很多，产品经常变动，不定型。国家也要求工厂企业实行多品种的生产，不断扩大新品种。这就相应地要求工人尽可能地掌握多工种技术，或者是掌握一种工种的各种技术，并且提高技术的熟练程度。事实上这也是学徒们的要求。现在许多工厂里，工种不必要地分得过细，在多品种生产的情况下，这只会造成浪费，并且影响工人技术水平的提高。上海机床厂有六十几种工种，据车间同志谈，好些工种完全可以合并，例如括工与装配工，划线工与钳工，都是可以由一个工人来做的。硬分开了，只好你做了这个工序，等别人来接替另一工序，相互等待，人力就会浪费。学徒待遇偏高，对国家对本人都不利
    学徒物质待遇偏高，是现行学徒制度中另一重要缺陷。上海机床厂、工具厂等几个厂的学徒，按规定每个月的津贴有二十四元的，有三十元的，有三十九元的三种。但据我们调查，这些厂绝大部分学徒现在都是三十九元，三十元的很少，二十四元的几乎没有。他们与一级正式工人（四十二元）仅差三元钱。除了个人伙食十二元到十四元，每月还可以多余二十五到二十七元，实际上这已经不是生活津贴的性质，而是低工资了。上海郊区农民在最近的大鸣大放中，对学徒收入过高意见很多。上海郊区农民每年平均收入是九十九元（比全国农民平均收入多二十九元），合每月八元二角五分，还不到学徒收入的四分之一。上海工厂学徒很多是来自郊区的年青人，他们进厂几个月，还没有成为正式工人，收入就比农民高几倍，显然是极不合理的。
    大部分学徒没有家庭负担，所以他们的实际收入普遍比老工人高，比老工人生活得优裕。学徒在工厂里的任务是学习，他们还没有成为一个正式工人，不能给国家生产物质财富，生活就比老工人的优裕，老工人们也不满意。
    还没有正式参加劳动就收入过多，这对还不会严谨地处理自己生活的青年人，也有很多坏处。青年学徒乱吃乱用、生活铺张浪费的情况极为普遍。有的人进厂时还比较朴素，不久就变化了。有一个青年学徒，他有个生活秩序表：每天二根冰雪糕，一星期看三场到五场电影，其余的时间是溜冰、跳舞、游泳。他们以艰苦朴素为耻，以奢侈浪费为荣。他们进厂后的第一个计划是买手表、呢裤子、手风琴、脚踏车等等。上海机床厂学徒宿舍里夜晚经常有人彻夜赌博。有的人钱输光了，花光了，就从事偷窃。今年1月到10月，这个厂破获了二十三件偷窃案件，其中二十一件是青年艺徒干的。
    钱太多了也不能鼓励学徒们上进。上海机床厂为了让学徒能很好学习，就规定学徒平时不坐厂内上下班的交通车，留在厂内住宿，星期天回家。这样就可以利用晚上的时间上技术或政治课。但不少学徒自己花六元钱买一张月季票，一下班就自动坐公共汽车走了，不愿留在厂里学习，尤其不愿意学习政治。在一些工厂的学徒中，流传着一句话：“学习X（技术），争取红派司（指高级知识分子的优待证），讨厌马克思（政治）”。不少徒工存在着浓厚的经济主义和单纯技术观点，不但只肯学技术，不肯学政治；而且只肯学他们认为有出息的轻松的技术，不肯学劳累的肮脏的技术。
    青年学徒中种种不良倾向的滋长，有复杂的社会原因，尤其与企业政治思想工作的薄弱有关，但是超过了社会一般生活水平的不合理的津贴制度，对这种倾向无疑起了推波助澜的作用。锅炉厂一位青年团委的同志说，“我们口口声声的要他们艰苦朴素，可是实际上他们口袋里却有许多钱，心里时时在打算为它找寻出路呢！”
          还应当有劳动品质的锻炼
    现行的工厂学徒制度，还存在着单纯技术观点的倾向，没有把体力劳动的锻炼，刻苦勤劳的思想品质的培养，列为学徒的一个重要任务。这也是一个根本的缺陷。现在工厂学徒中间不愿从事体力劳动，只愿学习技术的思想相当普遍。他们口口声声就是“我是来学技术的，没有技术的工作不干。”老师傅要他去仓库里领材料，他不去。老师傅要他擦洗机器，他不干。车间里大扫除，他就溜走。老工人看着这些青年人都摇头，说他们是“少爷兵”，“他们真是解放啦。”
    由于过去工厂里实行短期的“快速培养法”，学徒从事日常体力劳动的机会本来就很少，他们往往一进厂就下车间，确定工种，然后就由老师傅带着在车床上学技术，或者在课堂上学技术，几个月之后进行考试，“应知”、“应会”两项都及格，就提升为正式工人，许多人并且一跃就是三级工，甚至四级工，这种速度，不免使有些人昏了头。
    从上海这几个厂的情况中可以看出，现在工厂学徒的成分已有了很大变化。首先是学生增多了，特别是中学生越来越多。学徒文化水平高是一件好事，他们学习技术快，领会能力强。但也有不好的一面，就是他们大都沾染了比较浓厚的轻视体力劳动的剥削阶级思想，“读书人气味”很重，清高而且骄傲，缺乏体力劳动的习惯，瞧不起文化虽差、但有劳动经验的老师傅。其次是学徒中的家庭成分也大大变化了，学徒中资本家、地主家庭出身的子弟，和各种小资产阶级家庭出身的子弟，一天天增多。这些人当然带来了更多剥削阶级的脏东西。上面说到的目前工厂学徒中轻视体力劳动等种种不良倾向的蔓延，和这种学徒成分的变化是有关的。这种情况，就更加要求现在工厂的学徒制度中必须强调体力劳动的锻炼，和勤俭刻苦的思想品质的培养。老工人们说得好，刚踏进工厂大门的青年人，就好比刚出土的一棵小草，一味骄生惯养只会害他，让他一开头多吃些苦，多受些风雨的锻炼，长大了反而好。这些话是老工人们的经验之谈，也是他们关心自己的接班人的具体表现。
    加强体力劳动锻炼和延长学徒学习时间是有联系的。厂里一些同志的具体意见是：今后学徒进厂后，不首先确定工种，不立即下车间学技术，而是首先让他们参加厂内的各种辅助劳动，包括杂务工，搬运工，清洁工等等，把这个“劳动课”作为他们进厂的第一课，过一定时间之后（例如半年或一年），再下车间学技术。总之要在学徒期间改变他们轻视劳动的习惯和观念，以便今后把他们真正培养成为一个既有文化而又热爱劳动的新型工人。
      “包下来”的办法不能鼓励企业招收学徒
    现行工厂学徒制度对学徒是采取一律“包下来”的办法，即学徒不论他学习成绩是好是坏，只要他踏进了工厂的大门，学习期间没有犯大错误，学习期满后厂里都得录用。几年来的事实证明，这个制度也是有缺点的，它不能有效地鼓励学徒学习的积极性，弄得不好，时常给工厂背上“包袱”。这几个工厂都有这种情形：有一些学徒的学习成绩很差，品质不好，影响很坏，成为青年人中的“害群之马”，但又不够开除的资格，厂里就只好一样录用。还有些学徒，进厂后才发现他或者身体有病，或者其它原因，根本没有条件做工，厂里只好给他分配其它工作。上海机床厂就有几个人只好安插到科室做办事员。上海工具厂去年进厂的三、四个学徒身体本来不好，一进厂就生病，一年多来厂里每月发给他津贴三十几元，还负担了他的全部医药费，他的家属也因此享受了劳保待遇。他还没有劳动过一天，对国家还毫无贡献，但工厂却只好这样长期地供养他。现在有不少中小型工厂和手工业合作社，不敢招收学徒，很大的原因就是害怕这种“包下来”的制度，他们家底小，背不起“包袱”。
    那末应当怎样修改“包下来”的制度呢？人们认为可以用订立学徒合同的办法来代替，这就是学徒进厂前同工厂订立合同，言明工厂在学徒学习期满后，有权根据学徒学习成绩的优劣来挑选学徒进厂做工；如果有其它原因，它也可以不予录用。这种做法，可以提高工厂企业吸收学徒的积极性，也能够促进学徒积极学习。培养徒工的技工学校，也可以考虑修改目前这种“包下来”的办法，家庭经济情况好的不一定一律都享受公费待遇，而可以实行部分或全部自费。毕业的学生，工厂也同样可以根据学习成绩的优劣来取舍。
    按照“统筹兼顾、全面安排”的观点来修改学徒制度
    毛主席在关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话中教导我们说：我们作计划，办事，想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发，要从对全体人民的统筹兼顾这个观点出发。今天关于学徒制度问题，我们就需要根据这个观点，来重新加以检查、修改。人们认为，现行工厂学徒制度许多缺点的产生，从根本上来说，就是因为违背了这个观点，脱离了我国人口众多、经济落后的实际情况，没有吸取我国过去学徒制度中适合中国国情的一些长处。最近，国务院公布的关于国营、公私合营、合作社营、个体经营的企业和事业单位的学徒的学习期限和生活补贴的暂行规定草案，工厂的许多同志表示拥护，认为它所提出的一些办法体现了统筹兼顾、勤俭建国的精神。
