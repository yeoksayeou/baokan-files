    This newspaper reports: Guo Rongting, First Secretary of the Dali County Party Committee, reported: On the Cangshan Mountain in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, there is a small flatland of more than 10,000 mu. It used to be a “barren field” where no one lived. Now, a thriving agricultural cooperative has emerged.
    Before 1954, this rich and beautiful barren field was still an undeveloped virgin land. In the spring of 1955, a man named Duan Jimo walked into the barren field for the first time. Duan Jimo was a demobilized soldier from Zhoucheng Village, Dali. In the spring of 1954, he returned home after being demobilized from the Korean War. At that time, the town had not yet established cooperatives, and he participated in a mutual aid team. However, there were too many people and too little land here, so he remembered the barren field that the elders often mentioned and decided to go there to cultivate it. But some people told him, "Cangshan doesn't produce grain, you can't go there." Duan Jimo didn't listen to them. One day in March, Duan Jimo walked into the barren mountain. He grabbed a handful of heavy black soil, smelled it, looked at it... He thought: No matter how difficult it is, it can't be more difficult than the Korean battlefield. He ran all over the barren field, chose his "battlefield", and went down the mountain. A few days later, he carried his luggage, brought pots, pans, farm tools, and potato and buckwheat seeds, and went up the mountain alone, built a small thatched hut, and settled down. He cultivated five mu of wasteland, planted potatoes, sowed buckwheat, and went down the mountain again. He wanted to mobilize a few people to accompany him, but no one was willing to go. So he went up the mountain alone again. During the day, he continued to reclaim wasteland; at night, wild boars, bears, and deer came to eat potatoes, so he lit a bonfire to scare them away. Seeing the potatoes and buckwheat growing day by day, he went down the mountain to tell people that the potatoes were growing well, but people were still skeptical. Only a few curious young people followed him up the mountain and saw the potatoes, and they were overjoyed. These young people were willing to stay and form a mutual aid team with Duan Jimo.
    The people of Duan Jimo's mutual aid team carried potatoes down the mountain load after load, causing a sensation in the entire Zhoucheng Village. Men and women, young and old, all rushed to see. People said that the potatoes grew even better than those in the plains. Some people picked up a large potato weighing three or four catties and looked at it again and again.
    During the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization in the winter of 1955, the Dali County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of all county Party branch secretaries. At the meeting, the county Party committee proposed organizing reclamation teams to march into the barren mountains, to seek wealth from nature, and praised Duan Jimo's achievements in developing the barren field, and exhibited the potatoes he had tried to grow on the spot. Within a few days, nine townships near the barren field organized a reclamation team of 1,200 people. The county Party committee sent members Li Yunguang and Li Longwen to lead the team personally, with Duan Jimo as the guide, and they went up the mountain together. They built thatched huts on the mountain, drove away wild beasts, cleared thorns, and reclaimed 2,400 mu of wasteland. That year, they tried planting buckwheat, oats, barley, potatoes, radish seeds, etc., and achieved a bumper harvest. In that year, the average income of each member of the reclamation team was more than 70 yuan.
    In early 1957, an agricultural cooperative was formally established in the barren field. They collectively raised 139 cattle, horses, mules, and donkeys, and 134 pigs. They also engaged in more than a dozen sideline productions such as managing firewood, charcoal, lime, oil mills, basket weaving, and digging medicinal materials. The average income of each cooperative member reached 345 yuan, exceeding the living standards of well-to-do middle peasants in the plains. The agricultural cooperative also built a road four feet wide and more than 30 li long leading to the county seat, and built 43 two-story buildings and 99 thatched houses. Next year, they will also install telephones and broadcasting; build a large canal to divert water to the plains more than 60 li away, increasing irrigation for more than 4,000 mu of paddy fields in the plains; and establish a paper mill to make paper using the bamboo in the mountains.

    复员军人段继模带头上山
    一座荒山变成幸福乐园
    本报讯  中共大理县委第一书记郭溶廷报道：在云南省大理白族自治州的点苍山上，有一块一万多亩的小平坝，原来是没有一个人住的“荒甸”，现在却出现了一个欣欣向荣的农业合作社。
    1954年以前，这个富饶美丽的荒甸，还是一块未经开发的处女地。1955年春，有一个叫段继模的人，才第一次走进了荒甸。段继模是大理周城村的复员军人。1954年春，他从志愿军复员回家。那时，镇上还没有办社，他参加了互助组。可是，这里人多土地窄，于是他记起了老人们常说的荒甸，到那里去开垦；可是有人对他说：“苍山不出粮，去不得。”段继模没有听他们的话。3月的一天，段继模走进了荒山。他抓了一把沉甸甸的黑土，闻了又闻，看了又看……。他想：任凭你再艰苦，也艰苦不过朝鲜战场。他跑遍了荒甸，瞅好了阵地，就下山了。隔几天，他背着行李，带着锅碗农具，以及洋芋和荞麦种子，独自上了山，搭了个小草棚，就住了下来。他开垦了五亩荒地，栽下洋芋，撒下荞麦，又下山了。他想动员几个人去和他作伴，可是谁也不愿去。他又独自上山了。白天，他继续开荒；夜里，野猪、老熊、马鹿来吃洋芋，他就点起野火来吓唬它们。眼看洋芋和荞麦一天天的长大，他下山去告诉人们，说洋芋长得很不坏，人们还是半信半疑。只有几个好奇的年青人，跟他上了山，果真看到了洋芋，一个个高兴得了不得。这几个年青人愿意留下来，和段继模一起成立了互助组。
    段继模互助组的人，一背背一筐筐地把洋芋背下山，轰动了整个周城村，男女老少都赶来看，人们说洋芋长得比坝区的还强，有人抱起一个三四斤重的大洋芋看了又看。
    1955年冬的农业合作化高潮中，中共大理县委召开了全县党支部书记会议。县委在会上提出，组织垦荒队向荒山进军，向大自然索取财富，并且表扬了段继模开发荒甸的事迹，当场展览了他试种的洋芋。不几天，荒甸旁的九个乡，就组织了个一千二百人的垦荒大队，县委派了县委委员李运光、李龙文亲自率领，由段继模担任响导，一起上山了。他们在山上搭起草棚，赶跑野兽，清除了荆棘，开垦了荒地二千四百亩，当年就试种了荞麦、燕麦、大麦、洋芋、萝卜子等，而且获得了丰收。这一年，垦荒队每人平均收入七十元以上。
    1957年初，荒甸正式成立了农业社，又集体饲养了牛、马、骡、驴一百三十九头，猪一百三十四头，还经营木柴、木炭、石灰、油房、编篮子、挖药材等十多种副业生产。每个社员平均收入达三百四十五元，超过平坝地区富裕中农的生活水平。农业社还修了一条四尺宽三十多里长的通往县城的道路，盖了四十三间楼房和九十九间草房。明年，还要安设电话、广播；修筑一条大水沟，把水引向六十多华里远的坝区，为平坝增灌四千多亩水田；建立一个造纸厂，利用山间的竹子造纸。（葛维墨插画）（附图片）
