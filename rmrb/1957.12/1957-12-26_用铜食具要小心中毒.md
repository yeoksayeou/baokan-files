    Be Careful of Poisoning When Using Copper Tableware
    Chong Xi
    Copper pots and copper spoons still account for a considerable proportion of household utensils in many families. If these things are used improperly, they often cause poisoning accidents.
    In fact, copper itself does not poison people. Even if children accidentally swallow copper balls or copper buttons, it will not cause poisoning. However, some copper compounds, especially those that can dissolve in water, such as verdigris (commonly known as copper rust), as well as copper compounds used as bactericides in agriculture, are highly toxic to humans and animals. Swallowing copper compounds can cause acute poisoning: vomiting, bloody stools, abdominal pain, convulsions, and even paralysis leading to death. Under normal circumstances, improper use of copper tableware, although not causing acute poisoning, can lead to chronic poisoning. Copper-containing substances are slowly accumulated in the liver, pancreas, kidneys, nerves, and muscles of the body, causing their dysfunction and causing anemia, paralysis of the muscles and nervous system, and sometimes copper poisoning-specific colic. Therefore, chronic poisoning is also very harmful to human health.
    Under what conditions will copper tableware produce toxic copper compounds? If copper tableware is often in contact with acids, alkalis, as well as salt, wine, grease, etc., in a humid and airy environment, the copper will be corroded and produce toxic copper compounds. To prevent poisoning, pay attention to the following points:
    First, copper tableware should be scrubbed frequently to maintain its luster. If there is verdigris or blackening (oxidized) phenomenon, it must be polished before use. Because verdigris itself is extremely toxic; and the blackened layer on the surface of copper after being oxidized by air is also easily corroded into toxic substances.
    Second, do not use copper tableware to hold vinegar, oil, wine, alkali, jam, and salt, etc. Do not use copper utensils to hold pickles, sauerkraut, rice wine, sweet sauce, and fermented bean curd; and do not put copper spoons in jars containing these things often. Because the above foods are more or less acidic or alkaline, they can corrode copper in the air to produce toxic substances. Some people may feel that oil can prevent rust and do not believe that frequent contact between copper and oil will produce toxic substances. In fact, this is an illusion. Because oil contains a small amount of water and free acid, when copper is frequently in contact with oil, the copper will be corroded.
    Third, never use copper pots to cook foods containing vinegar and other acidic foods, such as cooking sauerkraut soup, making sweet and sour fish, crispy fish, cooking jam, etc. Do not put freshly cooked hot food in copper pots, as this will make the copper more easily corroded by acid and produce more toxins.
    I hope everyone will not buy copper tableware. When using copper tableware, be extra careful to avoid poisoning.

    用铜食具要小心中毒
    崇熙
    铜锅和铜匙目前在许多家庭日用食具中还占着不小的比例。这些东西如果应用不当，常常会引起中毒事故。
    事实上，铜并不会使人中毒，即使小孩误吞了铜球或铜钮扣也不致中毒。但是铜的一些化合物，特别是能溶化在水里的化合物，像铜锈（俗称铜绿），以及农业上用作杀菌剂的铜化合物等，对于人畜都是有强烈的毒性的。吞食了铜的化合物，就会引起急性中毒症：呕吐，便血，腹痛，痉挛以致麻痹死亡。一般情况下，如果使用铜质食具不当，虽然不致引起急性中毒，但却会导致慢性中毒。含铜的物质被慢慢地积存在身体中的肝脏、胰脏、肾脏、神经和肌肉等处，使它们的机能失调而发生贫血，肌肉和神经系统麻痹等，有时还会出现铜中毒时特有的绞痛。因此慢性中毒对人体健康的损害也是不小的。
    铜的食具在什么条件下就会产生出有毒的铜化合物呢？如果铜食具和酸、碱，以及食盐、酒、油脂等经常接触，在潮湿和有空气的情况下，铜就会被腐蚀，而产生有毒的铜的化合物。要防止中毒现象，需要注意以下几点：
    第一，铜质食具要经常擦洗，保持光泽。如有铜绿和变黑（已被氧化）现象，必须擦亮后再用。因为铜绿本身极毒；而铜受空气氧化以后表面上变黑的一层，也很容易被腐蚀后变成有毒的东西。
    第二，不能用铜质食具盛放醋、油、酒、碱、果酱和食盐等，更不要用铜器装泡菜、酸菜、酒酿、甜酱和霉豆腐等；也不要把铜匙经常放在装这些东西的罐子里面。因为上述食物都或多或少地带有酸性或碱性，在空气中都能使铜遭到侵蚀而产生有毒物质，有人也许会觉得，油是可以防锈，不相信铜和油经常接触也会产生有毒物质。其实这是错觉。因为油里含有少量的水和游离酸，当铜和油经常接触后，铜就会被腐蚀。
    第三，绝对不能用铜锅烧煮含醋的和其他酸性的食物，如煮酸菜汤，做糖醋鱼、酥鱼、煮果酱等。更不要把刚煮好的热的食物放在铜锅中，这样铜更容易被酸腐蚀，产生更多的毒物。
    希望大家不要买铜食具。在使用铜食具时，应多加小心，以免引起中毒。
