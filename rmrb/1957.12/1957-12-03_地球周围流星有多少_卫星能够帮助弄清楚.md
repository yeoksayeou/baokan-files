Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 2nd. According to TASS, the two artificial satellites orbiting the Earth and the carrier rocket of the first satellite have helped people understand the density of meteor distribution around the Earth. This was stated by Krinov, Academic Secretary of the Meteorite Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, in an article in "Soviet Russia".

Krinov also said that the three artificial celestial bodies have not yet encountered larger meteors.

Observations of artificial satellites make it possible to gain a deeper understanding of the movement of meteorites, the nature of their interaction with the atmosphere, and the process of their extinction.

Krinov said that because the first satellite and its carrier rocket will soon enter the denser atmosphere and then disintegrate like ordinary meteorites, we can observe it as the first batch of artificial meteorites. The satellite and carrier rocket will only burn up at altitudes below 100 to 120 kilometers above the ground, which is the altitude at which natural meteorites generally begin to burn.

It is expected that the sound of the rocket can be "heard" when it flies to an altitude below 50 or 60 kilometers. This sound will have various characteristics and intensities.

　　地球周围流星有多少
　　卫星能够帮助弄清楚
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：环绕地球旋转的两个人造卫星和第一个卫星的运载火箭已帮助人们弄清楚地球周围的流星分布的密度，这是苏联科学院陨星委员会学术秘书克里诺夫在“苏维埃俄罗斯报”上写的一篇文章中说的。
    克里诺夫还说，三个人造天体到现在为止还没有碰到较大的流星。
    对人造卫星的观察使我们有可能更深入地了解陨星的运动、它同大气互相影响的性质以及它陨灭的过程。
    克里诺夫说，由于第一个卫星和它的运载火箭很快就要进入密度较大的大气层，然后像普通陨星一样自行陨毁，因此我们就可以把它当作第一批人造陨星来观察。卫星和运载火箭要到离地面一百至一百二十公里以下的高空才会燃烧起来，天然陨星一般都在这样的高度才开始燃烧的。
    可以预期，火箭飞到五、六十公里以下的高度时就可以“听得到”它的声音，这种声音会带有各种不同的特点和强度。
