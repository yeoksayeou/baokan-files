Eradicate the Four Pests

*Zhejiang Daily*, December 27 editorial

Can the four pests be eradicated? Can the goal of Article 27 of the National Agricultural Development Program be achieved? The answer is a resounding yes. The example of Nanxun Town in Wuxing County, which basically eliminated flies in two years, as well as the more than thirty fly-free and mosquito-free examples throughout the province and the large number of "four-free granaries," are the most powerful proof. The example of Nanxun Town proves that as long as we are determined to eliminate the four pests and persevere unremittingly, the four pests will inevitably decrease in number, from many to few, and from few to none, and finally be completely eliminated. Although Nanxun Town in Wuxing has not yet completely eradicated the four pests today, with such a spirit and such a foundation, we have every reason to believe that we will be able to completely eliminate the four pests in the future.

It is absolutely necessary to eradicate the four pests, and there are not many people who are skeptical about this issue. Because everyone knows that flies, mosquitoes, rats, and sparrows are seriously harmful to human life. However, there are still many people who are skeptical and worried about whether the four pests can be completely eradicated. In particular, after a small typhoon of "the Forty Articles are advancing rashly" swept through last year, many people exaggerated the shortcomings in the work of eliminating the four pests, and minimized or negated the achievements of the work, which greatly affected the enthusiasm of the masses. This kind of thinking must be clarified, and this situation must be changed.

To eradicate the four pests, to turn our country into a "four-free country" without flies, mosquitoes, rats, or sparrows, and to turn our Zhejiang Province with more than 20 million people into a "four-free province," is a cause that our predecessors never dared to think about or do. But for the liberated working people, we dare to think and do things that our predecessors never did. The people who control their own destiny possess endless power, and once this power is awakened and organized, under the leadership of the Party, they will surely create all kinds of miracles. We dare to think about and eliminate the four pests, which is completely based on reason. Because the four pests can be eradicated is not something that anyone has fabricated out of thin air, but a fact that has already happened and exists in real life. There are already many such examples throughout the country, and today we have the fly-free example of Nanxun Town in our own province. Since some places can do it, this proves that it is possible to eradicate the four pests.

To eradicate the four pests, this precisely demonstrates the great ambition and great spirit of the working people of our country who are determined to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture and modern science. To build socialism, it is not only necessary to have economic construction in industry and agriculture, but also to develop science, popularize education, promote literary and artistic creation, improve people's health, raise the level of hygiene knowledge, and develop hygienic habits such as "everyone pays attention to hygiene and every family loves cleanliness." To eradicate the four pests, to cultivate good habits of everyone paying attention to hygiene and every family loving cleanliness, to eliminate diseases, to invigorate everyone, and to change customs and habits, this is culture, and it is precisely an important part of establishing modern science and culture. The Chinese people are a nation with ambition, and we are not only determined to establish modern industry and modern agriculture, but we must also have the ambition to establish modern science and culture. We will never give up until the four pests are eradicated.

To eradicate the four pests is indeed not an easy task, and we will encounter various difficulties on the road ahead, but as the National Agricultural Development Program points out: It all depends on human effort. For the liberated people of our country, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome. Not being afraid of difficulties has always been the great character of our working people. As long as we have the spirit of the Foolish Old Man who moved mountains and the revolutionary spirit of perseverance and indomitable will, the four pests will surely be eradicated.

To eradicate the four pests, it is not enough to have a strong spirit; we also need to have correct working methods and follow the mass line. We must fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and have everyone participate. The success of Nanxun Town, in addition to the great determination of the leaders and the masses, also lies in having correct mass line working methods. They publicized the principles of eliminating the four pests, and achieved "familiarity to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts," so the masses consciously and voluntarily joined the battle, and everyone took action and every family mobilized. They not only had in-depth ideological mobilization work, but also a series of meticulous organizational work. They attached importance to bringing into play the role of activists, valued the creativity of the masses, promptly summarized and promoted the effective methods and experiences of the masses in eliminating the four pests, and promptly commended and rewarded various model individuals and units. They were able to make proper arrangements based on different seasons and in close combination with the central tasks, put forward different requirements for eliminating the four pests, and established a complete set of systems. In technical work, they also learned while doing, keeping up closely. They did not adopt the bureaucratic and subjectivist methods of simply holding large meetings, issuing empty calls, rigidly pressing targets, and lacking measures. Leaders at all levels throughout the province and the people in all areas should learn from Nanxun Town, learn from their revolutionary spirit, revolutionary ambition, and correct methods, and eradicate the four pests completely. Each region now has more or less some successful models. These new seedlings are the foundation of the success of our cause and should be regarded as treasures, and carefully summarized and promoted.

In order to eradicate the four pests, each region should formulate a plan. Hangzhou City has already formulated a plan to strive to turn Hangzhou City into a "four-free city" within five years. The specific approach is three years of fighting and two years of cleanup, and the urban area will complete the task one year ahead of schedule. In order to realize this plan, a large-scale shock campaign to eliminate pests and diseases has been launched throughout the city since the 11th of this month to lay the foundation for future work. This approach is good and worthy of emulation by other regions. The specific practices in each region may be different. How many years to pilot, how many years to fight, and how many years to clean up should be planned according to the actual situation, but it is absolutely necessary to carry out a large-scale shock campaign to eliminate pests in combination with the current winter and spring production movement, and to earnestly implement the instructions of the Provincial People's Committee on eliminating the four pests in the current winter and spring. Each region should make unified arrangements for the central work and the work of eliminating the four pests, so that the central work is not affected by eliminating the four pests, and the elimination of the four pests is not squeezed out by only taking care of the central tasks, so as to achieve an organic combination of the two. Regions that have not yet formulated plans and have not yet taken action need to catch up.

    除尽四害
    浙江日报二十七日社论
    四害能否除尽？农业发展纲要第二十七条的目标能否实现？回答是肯定能够实现的。吴兴县南浔镇两年基本消灭苍蝇的范例，以及全省三十多处无蝇无蚊的范例和大批的“四无粮仓”，就是最有力的证明。南浔镇的范例证明了只要下定决心消灭四害，坚持不懈，四害一定会由多而少，由少而无，最后消灭干净。今天吴兴南浔镇虽然尚未全部除尽四害，但是有了这样一股干劲，有了这样一个基础，我们完全有理由相信，在今后一定时期内完全能够消灭四害。
    除尽四害完全有必要，对这个问题抱怀疑态度的人是不多的。因为人人都知道苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠、麻雀这些东西，对人类的生活有严重的危害。可是对于四害能否除尽，抱怀疑和忧虑态度的人还不少。特别是去年刮起了一阵“四十条冒进了”的小台风后，在除四害问题上有不少人夸大了工作中的缺点，缩小或否定了除四害工作的成绩，大大地影响了群众的积极性。这种思想必须澄清，这种情况必须改变。
    除尽四害，把我们国家变成一个无蝇、无蚊、无鼠、无雀的“四无国”，把我们两千多万人口的浙江省变成一个“四无省”，这是我们的前人所从未敢想，从未敢做的事业。但是对于解放了的劳动人民来说，我们就敢想、敢做前人从未做过的事情。掌握自己命运的人民，蕴藏着无穷无尽的力量，当这种力量一旦被唤醒和组织起来，在党的领导之下，一定会创造出各种各样的奇迹来。我们敢想、敢除四害，是完全有根据的。因为四害能够除尽，并不是任何一个人凭空臆造出来的，而是在现实生活中已经发生和存在了的事实。全国已有不少这种范例，今天我们本省也有了南浔镇的无蝇的范例。既然有的地方能够做到，这就证明除尽四害是可能的。
    要除尽四害，这正表现了我国劳动人民决心要把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国的伟大气魄，伟大志气。建成社会主义，不仅需要有工农业的经济建设，而且还需要发展科学，普及教育，繁荣文学艺术创作，改善人们的卫生状况，提高卫生知识水平，养成“人人讲卫生，家家爱清洁”的卫生习惯等。除尽四害，养成人人讲卫生，家家爱清洁的良好习惯，消灭疾病，人人振奋，移风易俗，这就是文化，也正是建立现代科学文化中的一项重要内容。中国人民是有志气的民族，我们不仅有决心建立现代工业和现代农业，而且一定还要有志气建立现代科学文化。四害不尽，决不罢休。
    要除尽四害，确非易事，在前进的道路上会遇到各种困难，但是正如农业发展纲要中指出的：事在人为。对于已经解放了的我国人民来说，是没有什么困难不可克服的。不怕困难，原来就是我们劳动人民的伟大性格。只要有愚公移山的劲头，有坚持不懈百折不挠的革命精神，四害一定能够除尽。
    除尽四害，光有一股干劲还不行，还需要有正确的工作方法，要走群众路线。做到充分发动群众，依靠群众，全民动手。南浔镇的成功经验，除了领导和群众的决心大以外，还在于有正确的群众路线工作方法。他们宣传除四害的道理，做到了“家喻户晓，深入人心”，因此群众自觉自愿投入战斗，做到了人人动手，家家动员。他们不仅有深入的思想发动工作，还有一系列的细致的组织工作。他们重视发挥积极分子的作用，重视群众的创造，及时总结和推广群众除四害的有效方法和经验，及时表扬和奖励各种模范人物和单位。他们能够根据不同季节，密切结合中心工作，妥善进行安排，提出不同的除四害的要求，而且建立了一套完整的制度。在技术工作上也是边学边做，紧紧跟上。他们采用的不是光开大会、空发号召、硬压指标、没有措施的官僚主义、主观主义的作法。全省各级领导，各地人民都要向南浔镇看齐，学习他们那股革命的干劲，革命的志气，正确的作法，把四害除尽灭光。各地现在或多或少都有一些成功的典型，这些新生的萌芽，是我们事业成功的基础，应该把它看成是宝贝，认真加以总结和推广。
    为了除尽四害，各地都要拟订一个规划。杭州市已经订出规划，争取在五年内提前把杭州市变成一个“四无市”。具体做法是三年战斗，两年扫尾，城区还要提前一年完成任务。为了实现这个规划，已经从本月11日起在全市范围内展开一个今冬明春大规模的除害灭病突击运动，为今后的工作打下基础。这种做法是好的，值得各地仿效。各地的具体做法可以不同，几年试点，几年战斗，几年扫尾，应该根据实际情况制订规划，但是结合今冬明春大生产运动，认真贯彻执行省人委关于在今冬明春除四害的指示，开展一个大规模的除害突击运动是完全有必要的。各地应该对中心工作和除四害工作统一加以安排，既不要因除四害影响中心工作，又不要只照顾中心挤掉除四害，要做到两者有机结合。现在尚未订立规划和尚未动手的地区，需要迎头赶上。
