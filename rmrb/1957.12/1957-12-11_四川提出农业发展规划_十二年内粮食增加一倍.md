Sichuan Proposes Agricultural Development Plan
Grain Production to Double in Twelve Years

(Our dispatch) The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China announced to the people of the province on the 5th a simplified plan for Sichuan Province to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program. This plan was discussed and approved at the recent plenary session of the Provincial Party Committee and submitted to the people of the province for discussion.

The plan requires that, within twelve years, the average annual grain yield per mu in each county of the province should generally be doubled. For those with a yield of 400 jin per mu in 1955, the goal is to reach 800 jin; for those with a yield of 450 jin or more per mu, the goals are 900 to 1,200 jin respectively; for those with a yield of less than 400 jin per mu, the goal is to more than double it, so that the total grain output of the province will increase from 40.4 billion jin in 1955 to 62 billion jin in seven years, and reach 78 billion jin in 1967. Except for the alpine mountainous areas and sparsely populated minority areas, the average annual grain yield per mu in the province should reach 800 jin, and efforts should be made to achieve this one year ahead of schedule. Specific target indicators are also proposed for other cash crops. Cotton yields per mu should reach 40 to 100 jin of ginned cotton.

To complete these plans, the province has decided to continue building small-scale water conservancy projects to expand the area of paddy fields with guaranteed irrigation from 40% in 1955 to 90% within seven years, and to expand the irrigable dry land area from 15% to 50%-70% of the dry land area. In conjunction with water conservancy irrigation, the aim is to establish a small hydropower station in basically one or several townships, with a total power generation capacity of 100,000 kilowatts, in order to gradually increase rural electricity consumption in conjunction with the large and medium-sized national power projects.

To improve soil and carry out soil and water conservation work, the first requirement is to convert sloping land with severe soil erosion into terraces or gentle slopes, build water conservancy projects, improve farming methods, and enhance drought resistance. To this end, all townships with soil and water conservation tasks should, starting next year, draw a certain amount of manpower, funds, and tools from each commune to form a basic construction team of about 100 people to specifically undertake technical projects. The province has 50 mountainous counties, with arable land accounting for one-quarter of the province, the population accounting for one-sixth, and grain accounting for one-seventh. In order to vigorously develop the mountain economy, while developing grain production, it is required to actively develop diversified economies according to local conditions, fundamentally change the face of barren mountain areas in ten years, and bring the average income of mountain farmers up to the average income level of farmers in the province. It has been decided to mobilize one million laborers to go to the mountains in ten years.

    四川提出农业发展规划
    十二年内粮食增加一倍
    本报讯　5日，中共四川省委向全省人民公布了四川省实现全国农业发展纲要的简要规划。这个规划是经过最近省委全体扩大会议讨论通过提交全省人民展开讨论的。
    规划要求，在十二年内，全省各县粮食每亩平均年产量一般要求增加一倍。1955年每亩产量已经达到四百斤的，要求达到八百斤；每亩产量四百五十斤以上的，分别达到九百——一千二百斤；每亩产量四百斤以下的，要求增加一倍以上，使全省粮食的总产量在七年内由1955年的四百零四亿斤，达到六百二十亿斤，1967年达到七百八十亿斤。除开高寒山区和地广人稀的少数民族地区以外，全省粮食每亩平均年产量达到八百斤，并争取提前一年实现。其他经济作物也提出具体要求指标。棉花亩产分别达到四十——一百斤皮棉。
    为完成这些规划，全省决定继续兴修小型水利，把有灌溉保证的水田面积，由1955年的40％七年内扩大到90％，把可以浇灌的旱地面积，由15％扩大到占旱地的50％—70％，结合水利灌溉，基本上做到一个乡或几个乡建立一个小型水力发电站，总发电量争取达到十万瓩，以便结合国家的大中型电力工程，逐步增加农村用电。
    为改良土壤开展水土保持工作首先要求把水土流失严重的坡地改为梯地或缓坡地，兴修水利改进耕作方法，增强坑旱能力。为此凡有水土保持任务的各乡，从明年起都应当从各社中抽出一定人力资金和工具，组成百人左右的基本建设队伍，全省共组织五十万个劳动力，专门担负技术性工程。全省有五十个山区县，耕地占全省四分之一，人口占六分之一，粮食占七分之一。为大力发展山区经济，要求发展粮食生产的同时，因地制宜积极发展多种经济，在十年内根本改变贫瘠山区的面貌，使山区农民的平均收入赶上全省农民平均收入水平。决定在十年内，动员一百万劳动力到山区去。
