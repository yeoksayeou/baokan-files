Why does water dropped into hot oil cause it to splatter?

Water is heavier than oil. When it falls into a hot oil pan, it immediately sinks to the bottom. Because the temperature at the bottom of the hot oil pan is very high, the water that reaches the bottom turns into steam and expands rapidly. The steam impacts the surrounding oil, causing an explosion, and the oil splashes out of the pan.

　　水落到热油锅里为什么要炸？
    水比油重，当它落到热油锅里，就立刻沉到锅底。由于热油锅底的温度很高，水落到锅底就化成蒸气，并且猛然膨胀。蒸气冲击周围的油便发生爆炸，油就迸溅到锅外。
