An old Red Army veteran, Chen Faqi, who participated in the Long March, is now demobilized and working in the Yangsi Agricultural Cooperative in the Mufu Mountains of Pingjiang County, Hunan Province. He has been farming here for four years, building the mountainous area diligently and thriftily with the masses.

Chen Faqi is 56 years old this year. He joined the Red Army on August 1, 1927, became a member of the Chinese Communist Party in February 1931, and is a third-class disabled veteran, a company-level cadre in the Red Army. In July 1953, he was demobilized from the Hunan Provincial Veterans' School and returned home to participate in agricultural production.

One early winter morning, I came to this village surrounded by mountains and found this revolutionary veteran in the fields. He was barefoot, hoeing rapeseed with the commune members.

Chen Faqi's hair is already gray, but he is very strong. The calluses on his hands are thick, and his feet have cracks.

I asked him:

"Is life good?"

"Very good! Very good!" he said. "I have earned over a thousand work points this year; adding my wife's, we have a total of more than fourteen hundred work points. It's a pity I'm old, and I can only do four or five work points a day."

Four work points a day, earning a thousand work points requires working two hundred and fifty days. I asked him: "Doesn't that mean you have to work every day?"

"Of course!" he said nonchalantly. "The life we have now is too comfortable compared to our revolutionary days, when we were often climbing in snow, drenched in rain, living in caves, and chewing on grass roots. What's a little more work!"

Chen Faqi's house has three small rooms. The eaves are hung with strings of golden corn, and the rooms are full of sweet potatoes and freshly dried sweet potato strands. The walls are hung with various kinds of farm tools, a typical mountain farmhouse.

Chen Faqi's wife is called Tong Qinglian. She is in her thirties. She joined the revolution in 1943 and the Communist Party in 1946. Every day, she takes care of six children, prepares meals, hoes the garden, grows vegetables, raises pigs, works in the cooperative, and also serves as the cooperative's cashier. When we arrived, she was carrying a child on her back, collecting sweet potato strands. This year, their family harvested more than two thousand catties of sweet potatoes, all of which she shredded, dried, and stored.

Chen Faqi's family is the best in the cooperative at growing vegetables and raising pigs. They have raised six marketable fat pigs in four years. This year, they raised a sow, and in the spring, they raised eight piglets, which they lent to poorer commune members to raise. Under his family's leadership, the number of pigs raised in the cooperative, which has one hundred and sixty-two households, has increased from more than twenty in 1954 to more than two hundred and fifty now.

Chen Faqi's family lives very frugally. Chen Faqi has been wearing his yellow military uniform for eleven years, and his cotton-padded coat has been worn for five winters, patched everywhere. His wife wears the same. Four years ago, when he and his wife were demobilized and returned home, the state gave them more than five thousand yuan in demobilization production subsidies and resettlement fees. In the past few years, in addition to spending several hundred yuan on purchasing farm tools, repairing houses, and investing in the agricultural cooperative, they still have nearly four thousand yuan in the bank as education funds for their children in the future. Currently, they mainly live on their own labor income. Many commune members have advised Chen Faqi: "You suffered a lot during the revolution. Now you should eat and dress better, and don't be so frugal." Chen Faqi always explains to these people: "We are living a very good life! If we save money, we won't have to ask the state for help when we have difficulties. That way, the country's construction will be faster, and everyone's life will improve faster."

Responsible cadres from the Pingjiang County Party and government and teachers and students from nearby schools often visit this revolutionary veteran. Last winter, when the Minister of Finance and Trade of the Pingjiang County Party Committee brought a visiting delegation to his home, they discovered that the supply of cooking oil and pork in the countryside was relatively tight at the time. They wrote him a preferential certificate for buying cooking oil and pork, hoping that the local supply departments would take care of him and not make the revolutionary veteran queue to buy meat. Later, after the cooperative cadres used this letter to buy three catties of cooking oil, Chen Faqi immediately took back the certificate and dissuaded the cooperative cadres from doing so. He said: "We Communists should share weal and woe with the masses and should not enjoy privileges." From then on, he still bought cooking oil according to the local masses' cooking oil supply standards and queued up with the masses to buy pork.

After the national liberation, Chen Faqi considered that he was old, his cultural level was not high, and it would be more helpful to the country to return home to produce than to engage in office work. In 1953, after they returned to Pingjiang County, a deputy county magistrate warmly received them and advised them to live in the county seat for convenience. Chen Faqi politely declined. After returning home, the local government gave him houses and land and prepared to cultivate the land for him on his behalf. He also declined. He repaired the house himself and bought cattle and farm tools to settle down and engage in production.

At that time, the work in the township was relatively backward. There was no Party organization, and there were no mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Under the assistance of the higher Party committee, he ran a people's school that winter to promote the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation, cultivate poor peasant backbones, and organize labor exchange and mutual assistance. He first formed the first mutual aid group with nine poor and lower-middle peasant households, and then the whole township developed to thirty-two. From the establishment of the Communist Party branch in the township in the spring of 1954 to the abolition of the district and merger of townships in 1956, he served as the township branch secretary. In the winter of 1955, he established the first elementary agricultural production cooperative in the township, and now the whole township has achieved advanced collectivization.

Last year, as the township branch secretary, he earned more than eight hundred work points and often played a leading role in production. In the winter of 1953, he took the lead in draining a pond, carrying more than 1,500 loads of pond mud to his four mu of land. The following year, these few mu of land became a high-yield field in the township, changing the local masses' conservative thinking that pond mud was not fertile and enabling the township to find a large amount of fertilizer. In 1955, he also took the lead in trying to grow double-cropping rice in the mountains and promoted uniform and dense planting, achieving a bumper harvest. The local government organized farmers from the whole township to visit, so that this area, which had never grown double-cropping rice in history, now has 60% of the rice fields planted with double-cropping rice. The grain yield has increased from 300 catties per mu before liberation to more than 680 catties this year. Next year, this cooperative may reach 1,000 catties per mu. Now, he is working with the masses to accumulate fertilizer from morning till night. The whole cooperative has an average of more than 100 loads of soil fertilizer per mu, which is more than double the same period last year.

I followed Chen Faqi through this mountain village for a week. This cooperative only has a few hundred mu of small bald mountains. After Chen Faqi returned home, he spent his own money to buy more than 130,000 tree seedlings and mobilized the masses to plant trees extensively. Now the newly planted pine trees are already half a person tall. Small pieces of wasteland on the hillside have been reclaimed and planted with wheat. Two water pumps have been installed on the small mountain by the river. The river water flows over the mountain col and irrigates more than 2,000 mu of farmland. This place, which used to suffer from drought nine years out of ten, is now free from drought and flood worries. Chen Faqi said that next year they will carry the tidal sand from the river to the sticky mud fields to improve the soil; they will build new-style tea gardens and orchards on the hillside. They want to gradually turn this barren mountainous area into a rich place.

    埋头建设山区的老红军
    胡坚
    湖南平江县幕阜山的杨泗农业社里，有位参加过二万五千里长征的转业老红军陈发启。他已经在这里种了四年地，和群众一道克勤克俭地建设着山区。
    陈发启今年五十六岁，1927年8月1日参加红军，1931年2月参加中国共产党，是一位三等甲级残废军人，红军的连级干部，1953年7月从湖南省荣军学校转业回家参加农业生产。
    一个初冬的早上，我来到这个群山环抱的山村里，在田间找到了这位革命老人，那时，他正赤着脚和社员们一道锄油菜。
    陈发启的须发已经斑白，但身体很结实。手上的茧磨得很厚，脚上有着一道道的裂痕。
    我问他：
    “生活好么？”
    “很好！很好！”他说：“我今年作了一千多个工分；加上我妻子的，共有一千四百多工分。可惜年老了，一天只能做四、五分工。”
    一天做四分工，做一千个工分就要整整出工二百五十天。我问他：“那不每天要出工？”
    “当然啰！”他满不在乎地说：“现在的日子，比起我们从前闹革命，经常雪里爬，雨里淋，住岩洞，嚼草根的生活来说，太享福了，多作点工夫算什么！”
    陈发启的家里有不大的三间住房，屋檐下挂满了一提提金黄色的包谷，房里到处堆着红薯和刚晒干的红薯丝，墙上挂着各种式样的农具，完全是一个山村农家。
    陈发启的妻子叫童清莲，有三十多岁，她是1943年参加革命、1946年参加共产党的老同志。她每天带着六个小孩，弄茶饭，锄园，种菜，养猪，在社里出工，还担任社的出纳员。我们去时，她正背着小孩在收红薯丝。今年他家收获两千多斤红薯，都是她一个个刨成丝、晒干收藏的。
    陈发启家种菜养猪是全社最出色的，四年里养了六头出栏大肥猪。今年养了一头母猪，春天养了八个小猪，都借给了比较贫困的社员饲养。在他家带动下，全社一百六十二户养的猪由1954年的二十多头发展到现在的二百五十多头。
    陈发启家的生活非常俭朴。陈发启身上穿的黄军服已经穿了十一年、棉衣也穿了五个冬天，到处都补过了。他妻子穿的也是这样。四年前，他夫妇复员回家时，国家曾给他们五千多元的转业生产补助费和安家费。几年来，除了添置农具、整修房屋和在农业社投资花去几百元外，现在银行里还存有近四千元，作为将来子女的教育经费。目前，他们主要是靠自己的劳动收入过活。好些社员都劝陈发启：“干革命，吃尽了苦，现在，该吃好点、穿好点，不要太节省了。”陈发启总是向这些人解释：“我们过的生活很好啦！把钱节下来，有困难就不向国家要，这样，国家的建设就搞得快些，大家的生活也会改善得快些。”
    平江县党、政府的负责干部和附近学校里的师生，经常来访问这位革命老人。去冬，中共平江县委财贸部长带访问团来到他家时，发现当时农村食油、猪肉供应比较紧张，就给他写了一封优待买食油、猪肉的证明信，希望当地供应部门加以照顾，买肉也不要让这位革命老人排队。后来，社干部拿这封信买了三斤食油，陈发启马上收回了这封证明信，劝阻社干部不要这样做。他说：“我们共产党员应该与群众同甘共苦，不能享受特权。”从此，他仍旧按当地群众食油供应标准购买食油，买猪肉也同群众一道去排队。
    全国解放后，陈发启就考虑到自己年老了，文化水平又不高，搞机关工作还不如回家生产对国家帮助大些。1953年他们回到平江县后，一位副县长热情地接待了他们，并劝他们住在县城里方便些。陈发启婉言谢绝了。回到家里，当地政府给他房屋、田地，并且准备给他代耕。他也谢绝了。自己整修好房屋，还买了耕牛、农具，安家落户搞生产。
    当时乡里的工作比较落后，没有建党，也没有互助合作组织。他在上级党委协助下，那年冬天就办民校，宣传互助合作的优越性，培养贫农骨干、组织变工互助。他首先和九户贫农、下中农成立了第一个互助组，跟着全乡就发展到三十二个。从1954年春天乡里建立共产党支部到1956年撤区并乡时止，他一直担任乡支部书记。1955年冬天他在乡里建立了第一个初级农业生产合作社，现在全乡已实现高级合作化了。
    去年他担任乡支书作了八百多个劳动工分，而且经常在生产中起带头作用。1953年冬天他第一个带头车干一口塘，挑了一千五百多担塘泥下到他的四亩田里，第二年这几亩田就成了全乡的高额丰产田，改变了当地群众认为塘泥不肥的保守思想，使全乡找到了大量的肥源。1955年他又第一个带头在山区试种双季稻和推广均匀密植获得丰收，当地政府组织全乡的农民来参观，使得这个历史上从没有种过双季稻的地区现在有60％的稻田种上了双季稻，粮食产量由解放前的每亩三百斤增加到今年的六百八十多斤。明年这个社可能达到每亩一千斤。现在，他每天和群众一道起早贪黑地积肥，全社平均每亩已有土肥一百多担，比去年同期多一倍。
    我随陈发启在这山村里走了一周。这个社只有几百亩小秃山，陈发启回家以后就自己拿钱买了十三万多株树苗，发动群众普遍造林，现在新植的松树已有半个人高了。山坡上一小块块的荒地都被开垦出来种上了麦子。在临河的小山上安装了两部抽水机，河水翻过山坳，灌溉着两千多亩农田，这个十年九旱的地方，现已水旱无忧。陈发启说，明年他们要把河里的潮沙挑到粘泥田里，改良土壤；要在山坡上建立起新式的茶园和果园。要逐年把这贫瘠山区变成富饶的地方。
