Everyone Has a Responsibility
　　By our reporter Gu Ye

　　In the Huangshiban mine of the Yangquan Mining Bureau's No. 1 Mine, there is an air compressor that supplies air to the pneumatic drills. This valuable new machine broke down after only nine hours of use.

　　The accident occurred on June 27th, and by September, it was still unclear who was responsible. More than 170 electrical and mechanical workers in the entire mine held a special debate on this matter.

　　At the beginning of the debate, the drivers said that they had noticed an abnormal sound in the machine's operation that day, and they had reported it to the workers who maintained the machine. They had fulfilled their responsibility. The maintenance workers said that the new machine had inherent problems, and they could not guarantee that it would not malfunction. The repair workers said that the machine had been tested and had no problems before it was put into use, so they should not be blamed for the accident.

　　So, who was responsible? Let's analyze it in depth.

　　Guo Wei: "The maintenance workers are responsible. Before I took over the shift, Wang Jianguo checked the machine and said that the abnormal sound was because the belt was hitting the pulley. After I took over, when Pan Xiaohai checked the machine, he picked up half an electrical coil from inside the machine and concluded that the abnormal sound was because the coil was hitting the cylinder. After I started driving, I found that he was wrong, and the machine vibrated greatly. I immediately stopped the car. He asked to try it again, and after trying it five or six times, the machine suddenly stopped moving with a 'click'. When the machine was disassembled, it turned out that the split pin of a pipe screw in the crankcase was broken, and the screw had fallen out. They didn't find the cause of the abnormal sound, but insisted that we try the car, how could there not be an accident?"

　　Zhang Jiayu: "The maintenance workers didn't understand but pretended to, and were careless, so they are responsible. But the repair section also has some responsibility..."

　　Shi Tongyu: "The repair workers should be held primarily responsible."

　　Zhu Changjiang: "People tested it and it had no problems before putting it into use, why should they be held primarily responsible?"

　　Shi Tongyu: "They didn't check carefully!"

　　Geng Zhilong: "Shi Hengsheng, Li Jiquan, and I did only a general check, not a detailed check of all parts of the machine, especially we didn't pay attention to the screws."

　　Shi Tongyu: "That's right! Your repair workers often blindly believe that new machines have no problems, so you only look at the surface of the machine before sending it for a test run. As a result, small problems become big problems, and a small split pin ruins a new air compressor."

　　Zhang Jiayu: "The repair section didn't tighten the first check, and the maintenance workers should have tightened the second check. The repair was careless, the maintenance was also careless, and the accident passed smoothly."

　　Guo Wei: "We also have a responsibility for not doing a good job at the third check. The maintenance workers repeatedly asked us to test the car. We knew that the machine could not be started, so we should have refused to test the car. But we thought: if he asks us to test the car, he will be responsible if something goes wrong. We didn't think about protecting the machine and protecting state property is everyone's responsibility."

　　The deeper the debate, the higher everyone's awareness. Originally, everyone said they had no responsibility, but in the end, everyone said they had a responsibility and deeply realized the harm of a lack of responsibility.

　　After the debate, people began to work meticulously and conscientiously, and automatically established various responsibility systems. Geng Zhilong said to the repair workers that in the future, no matter what machine, they must check it in detail before testing it, and there must be acceptance and signature procedures after the test. In October, a new winch came, and after inspection, it was found that there was a problem with the bearing cap, and one tooth was two millimeters off. The workers then disassembled the machine and repaired it again. The drivers checked the machine before getting off work, and let the people taking over carefully inspect it. Once, when Guo Wei took over, he found that the split pin of the air compressor was broken, so he replaced it in time, avoiding another accident.

　　The No. 1 Mine had eight power accidents in July, but only one in October. The workers said: "This is the harvest of the special debate on the air compressor accident." (Attached picture)

    大家都有责任
    本报记者　顾页
    阳泉矿务局一矿黄石坂矿井里，有一台给风镐送风的压风机。这台贵重的新机器，只使用九小时就坏了。
    事故是6月27日发生的，到9月，还没弄清是谁的责任。全矿一百七十多名机电工人为这件事举行了专题辩论。
    辩论开始的时候，司机说，那天他们发现机器运转声音异常，就报告了维护机器的工人。他们已经尽到责任了。维护工说，新机器原来就有毛病，他们没法保证它不出岔子。检修工说，这台机器经试验没有毛病，才交付使用的，出了事故不能怪他们。
    到底是谁的责任呢？深入分析看看。
    郭威：“维护工是有责任的。我接班开车之前，王建国检查过机器，他说机器运转声音异常是因为皮带打了皮带轮。我接班后，潘小孩检查机器时，从机器里拣出半块电圈，就断定机器运转声音异常，是因为电圈打了汽缸。我开车后发现他说得不对，机器震动很大，立刻停了车。他又叫试一试，这样左试右试，试了五、六次，最后，咔嚓一声机器不能动了。拆开机器看，原来是曲轴箱里一只管螺丝的开尾肖断了，螺丝掉了出来。他们没找着机器运转声音异常的原因，硬叫我们试车，怎能不出事故？”
    张加玉：“维护工不懂装懂，马马虎虎，是有责任的。但检修工段也有一定的责任……”。
    史通玉：“检修工要负主要责任。”
    朱长江：“人家试验没有毛病才交付使用，为什么要负主要责任？”
    史通玉：“他们没有仔细检查过呀！”
    耿治龙：“我和史恒升、李计全的确只作了一般检查，没有细致检查机器的各个部分，特别是没注意螺丝。”
    史通玉：“是呵！你们检修工常常盲目地认为新机器就没有问题，所以，只看机器表面，就送去试车。结果，小毛病变成大毛病，一个小小的开尾肖毁了一台新压风机。”
    张加玉：“检修工段没把紧第一道关，维护工就应当把紧第二道关。检修马虎，维护也马虎，事故就顺利过关了。”
    郭威：“我们没把好第三关也有责任。维护工一再叫我们试车。我们明知机器不能开了，就该拒绝试车。可是，我们心想：他叫试车，出了毛病便由他负责。“没想到爱护机器，爱护国家财产，是我们大家的责任。”
    辩论越深入，大家的觉悟越高。原来大家都说自己没有责任，最后大家都说自己有责任，而且深深认识到责任心不强的危害。
    辩论会后，人们都开始精细认真地干活，并且自动建立起各种责任制度。耿治龙对检修工们说，以后无论什么机器，都要详细检查后才试验，试验后必须有验收签字的手续。10月份来了一台新绞车，检查后，发现瓦盖有毛病，一个牙齿差了两糎。工人们便拆了机器重新修理。司机们都在快下班前检查机器，让接班人仔细验收。一次，郭威接班时发现压风机的开尾肖断了，便及时更换，避免了事故再次发生。
    一矿的动力事故7月份发生过八次，10月份只一次。工人们说：“这是压风机事故专题辩论的收获。”（附图片）
