Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, December 22nd: The All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese recently held its First Session, Second Plenary Committee Meeting in Xiamen. The meeting reviewed the work of the past year, proposed the working principles and tasks for 1958, and discussed how the Federation should implement overseas Chinese affairs policies.

Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, delivered an opening speech at the meeting, stating: The establishment of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese aims to unite and educate returned overseas Chinese, their families, and the children of overseas Chinese to actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. Recently, the people of the whole country have launched a wave of "going up to the mountains and down to the countryside" and actively participating in labor production. He called on returned overseas Chinese and their families to, without exception, advance on the socialist road just like the people of the motherland.

The meeting listened to Fang Fang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, relay the report of the Second Session, First Plenary Committee Meeting of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission regarding the current overseas Chinese affairs policies, and the explanation regarding the "Working Principles and Tasks of the Federation for 1958." The meeting also listened to Zhuang Mingli, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, report on the general situation of the Federation's work over the past year. The meeting conducted lively discussions using group meetings and big-character posters, and passed a resolution on deliberating the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese's 1957 work report and the draft of the 1958 work principles and tasks.

The committee members unanimously expressed their full acceptance of the instructions of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission regarding the current overseas Chinese affairs policies, and decided to make every effort to implement these instructions in future work, and to regard them as the basic line of the work of overseas Chinese federations at all levels. At the same time, they should always pay attention to and vigilantly criticize any tendencies that deviate from this socialist overseas Chinese affairs line.

The meeting held that the work of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese had developed in the past year and had achieved many successes. It had played a certain role both in uniting and educating the families of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese to respond to the call of the state, actively participate in social reform and socialist construction, and in providing services such as accepting various entrusted matters on behalf of overseas Chinese, their families, and returned overseas Chinese. However, there were shortcomings and errors, such as insufficient assistance to local overseas Chinese federations, failure to promptly understand the work of local overseas Chinese federations, and failure to analyze and study the difficulties encountered in the work of local overseas Chinese federations to seek reasonable solutions, and so on.

The meeting further clarified the nature of the overseas Chinese federation organization: it is a people's organization composed of returned overseas Chinese from all strata, mainly a mass organization composed of newly returned overseas Chinese, and is an assistant to the Party and the government in implementing overseas Chinese affairs policies under the leadership of the Party and the government. Therefore, the meeting required local overseas Chinese federations to further rectify and transform the organization of the overseas Chinese federation on the basis of rectification. The leadership core of the overseas Chinese federation should be composed of progressive elements who resolutely support socialism and resolutely take the socialist road, and should appropriately arrange for other influential people in society. At the same time, it is necessary to absorb those who have adhered to the socialist direction in the anti-rightist struggle, especially to absorb representative figures from the workers and other working people among the returned overseas Chinese, to participate in the leadership work of the overseas Chinese federation, so that the overseas Chinese federation truly becomes an assistant to the Party and the government in implementing overseas Chinese affairs policies, and becomes a people's organization that unites and promotes the vast number of returned overseas Chinese and their families to participate in socialist construction and transformation together with the people of the whole country, and serves socialism.

The meeting pointed out that the most important task of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and local overseas Chinese federations at present is to promote, under the unified leadership of the Party and the government, the further participation of returned overseas Chinese, their families, and returned overseas Chinese students in the socialist great debate, and to deeply carry out the anti-rightist struggle within the overseas Chinese federations at all levels, so that they can further distinguish between right and wrong, gradually weaken and eliminate the influence of capitalist ideology, and more firmly establish their confidence and determination to take the socialist road; to overcome the ideological tendencies of belittling labor, belittling agricultural production, extravagance and waste, and yearning for urban life, to raise socialist consciousness, and to establish the idea of labor production and thriftiness, and to call on them to happily go up to the mountains and down to the countryside to participate in labor, and to gradually establish a labor perspective and a mass perspective in labor, and to gradually eliminate the special thinking of being divorced from the masses.

The meeting held that the overseas Chinese federation should, on the basis of improving the socialist consciousness of the families of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese, further promote the active participation of the families of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese together with the local people in the great production movement, strive for a bumper harvest, and strive to gradually realize the National Agricultural Development Program (revised draft) and fundamentally change the face of the overseas Chinese areas. At present, the families of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese should be encouraged to use the surplus funds from remittances from overseas to build small and medium-sized water conservancy and hydropower stations in their hometowns; at the same time, they should be guided and encouraged to invest in setting up small fertilizer factories in their hometowns, and strive to raise pigs to accumulate fertilizer, and strive to raise one or two pigs per overseas Chinese household in 1958.

The meeting held that the overseas Chinese federation should, in accordance with the state's policy of resettling returned overseas Chinese, conduct publicity and education among returned overseas Chinese and their families who are unemployed and seeking relief or employment in towns, and returned overseas Chinese students and children of overseas Chinese families who cannot pass the entrance exams and do not have the conditions to continue their studies, and encourage them to go to the countryside and mountains to participate in agricultural production and settle down, pointing out that this is an important direction for resettling returned overseas Chinese to participate in labor production in the future.

The meeting held that the current overseas Chinese affairs policy regarding overseas Chinese affairs is an important policy with historical significance for the overseas Chinese affairs work to implement China's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, promote friendly relations between China and Southeast Asian national independent countries, safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, and expand the patriotic unity of overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese federation should help its members and all returned overseas Chinese and their families reach a consensus in their thinking and faithfully implement it.

At this meeting, Wang Jiechen, Chen Shiyin, Weng Huihao (female), Zhang Youquan, and Fu Weidan, five returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, Malaya, and South America, were re-elected and newly elected as members of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese.

This meeting was held from December 11th to 19th. Ye Fei, First Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Fujian Province, attended the opening ceremony of the meeting and delivered a speech at the meeting.

    中华全国归国华侨联合会全体委员会议确定
    加强领导协助政府贯彻侨务政策
    团结归侨积极参加社会主义建设
    新华社厦门22日电  中华全国归国华侨联合会最近在厦门举行第一届第二次全体委员会议，会议审查了一年来的会务情况，提出了1958年的工作方针和任务，讨论了侨联如何贯彻侨务政策的问题。
    全国侨联主席陈嘉庚在会上致开幕词说：全国侨联的建立，目的就是为了团结教育归侨、侨眷和侨属子女积极参加祖国的社会主义建设，最近全国人民掀起一项“上山下乡”、积极参加劳动生产的浪潮，他号召归侨、侨眷应该毫无例外地和祖国人民一样，向社会主义道路前进。
    会议听了全国侨联副主席方方传达华侨事务委员会第二届第一次全体委员会议关于当前侨务政策的报告，和关于“1958年侨联的工作方针和任务”的说明，听了全国侨联副主席庄明理关于一年来会务概况的报告，会议利用小组会、大字报进行了热烈的讨论，通过了关于审议全国侨联1957年工作报告和1958年工作方针任务（草案）的决议。
    委员们一致表示全部接受华侨事务委员会关于当前侨务政策的指示，决定在今后会务中全力为贯彻执行这些指示而努力，并且把它作为各级侨联工作的基本路线，同时还要经常注意和警惕地批判任何离开这一社会主义侨务路线的各种倾向。
    会议认为，全国侨联一年来工作有开展，取得了不少成绩。无论在团结教育侨眷和归侨响应国家号召，积极参加社会改革和社会主义建设，以及在接受华侨、侨眷和归侨的各种委托代办事项等服务工作上，都起了一定作用。但存在有缺点和错误，如对各地侨联的帮助不够，没有及时了解各地侨联的工作情况，对于各地侨联工作上遇到的困难，没有加以分析研究，求得合理解决等等。
    会议进一步明确了侨联组织的性质：它是一个各阶层归侨参加的人民团体，主要是由新归侨参加组成的群众组织，是在党和政府的领导下，协助党和政府贯彻侨务政策的助手。因此，会议要求各地侨联在整风的基础上，进一步整顿改造侨联的组织。侨联的领导核心，应该由坚决拥护社会主义和坚决走社会主义道路的进步分子组成，并应适当安排在社会上有影响的其他人士。同时，要吸收在反右派斗争中坚持社会主义方向的人，特别是吸收归侨中的工人和其他劳动人民中有代表性的人物，参加侨联的领导工作，使侨联真正成为党和政府贯彻侨务政策的助手，成为团结和推动广大归侨、侨眷同全国人民一起参加社会主义建设和改造事业，为社会主义服务的人民团体。
    会议指出，当前全国侨联和各地侨联的头等重要的任务，就是在党和政府的统一领导下，推动归侨、侨眷和归国华侨学生进一步参加社会主义大辩论，深入开展各级侨联内部的反右派斗争，使他们进一步明辨大是大非，逐步削弱和肃清资本主义思想的影响，更加坚定走社会主义道路的信心和决心；克服轻视劳动、轻视农业生产，铺张浪费、向往城市生活的思想倾向，提高社会主义觉悟，树立劳动生产、勤俭持家的思想，号召他们愉快地上山下乡参加劳动，并在劳动中逐渐建立起劳动观点和群众观点，逐渐消除脱离群众的特殊思想。
    会议认为，侨联应该在侨眷、归侨社会主义觉悟提高的基础上，进一步推动归侨、侨眷和当地人民一起积极参加大生产运动，争取大丰收，为逐步实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）、根本改变侨区面貌而努力。在当前，应该鼓励侨眷、归侨把侨汇余资用在家乡兴办中小型水利和水电站上；同时要引导和鼓励归侨、侨眷在侨乡投资兴办小型肥料厂，并努力养猪积肥，争取在1958年内每户侨户养一头到两头猪。
    会议认为，侨联应根据国家安置归侨的方针，向住在城镇失业而要求救济或要求就业的归侨、侨眷，和考不上学校又没有升学条件的归国华侨学生及侨属子女进行宣传教育，鼓励他们下乡上山参加农业生产，安家立业，指出这是今后安置归侨参加劳动生产的重要的方向。
    会议认为，当前侨务政策中关于国外侨务方面的政策，是侨务工作为贯彻执行我国的和平共处五项原则，促进我国与东南亚民族独立国家的友好关系，维护华侨的正当权益，扩大华侨爱国团结的有历史意义的重要政策。侨联应当帮助会员和全体归侨、侨眷在思想上取得一致认识，忠实贯彻执行。
    这次会议补选和增选了王捷臣、陈失因、翁会好（女）、张有权、傅维丹五位印度尼西亚、马来亚和南美洲归国华侨为全国侨联委员。
    这次会议是12月11日到19日举行的。中共福建省委第一书记、福建省省长叶飞出席了会议的开幕式，并在会上讲了话。
