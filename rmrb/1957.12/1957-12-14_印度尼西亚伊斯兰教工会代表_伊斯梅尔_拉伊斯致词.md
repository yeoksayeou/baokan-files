Honorable Executive Chairman of the Congress, esteemed delegates, and brothers attending the Congress:

    As the representative of the Indonesian Islamic Trade Union, I would first like to extend my greetings on behalf of the headquarters of the Indonesian Islamic Trade Union and all its members to the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions.

    The Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions has already opened on December 2, 1957, but due to certain reasons, I am a bit late. I ask for my brothers' forgiveness.

    At the same time, I have not forgotten to express my gratitude to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for inviting us to attend this Congress, and I wish the Congress every success in gaining the full attention of the participants so that the Congress can make conclusions that are very beneficial to the workers' struggle and to the prosperity of society and the country.

    I would like to raise a significant issue here, which is that West Irian has not yet returned to the embrace of the Indonesian motherland. Therefore, for the sake of world peace, especially the peace of the entire Asia and Africa, I appeal to all brothers, hoping that all workers in Asia and Africa will pay full attention to this issue.

    Next, I shout:

    Long live the Chinese government, people, and all workers!

    We have also not forgotten to express our gratitude to all the responsible personnel of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for your very satisfactory hospitality towards our representatives from Indonesia.

    Please allow me, on behalf of all members of the Indonesian trade union delegation, to present a small gift to the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, and please ask them to come forward.

    Although this gift is not very valuable, it has great significance. Because this gift is the national emblem of the Republic of Indonesia, which says "Unity in Diversity." We hope that this gift can become a symbol of the eternal friendship between Indonesian workers and people and Chinese workers and people.

    My speech is finished. Thank you!

    印度尼西亚伊斯兰教工会代表
    伊斯梅尔·拉伊斯致词
    尊敬的大会执行主席、各位代表和出席大会的兄弟们：
    我以印度尼西亚伊斯兰教工会代表的身分，首先在此代表印度尼西亚伊斯兰教工会总部及其全体会员，向中国工会第八次全国代表大会致意。
    中国工会第八次代表大会已在1957年12月2日开幕，但由于某些原因，我来晚了一些。我请兄弟们原谅。
    同时，我也没有忘记向邀请我们前来参加这个代表大会的中华全国总工会表示感谢，并预祝大会获得与会者的充分关怀，使大会能作出对工人斗争以及对社会和国家的繁荣十分有益的结论。
    我在这里想提出一个重大的问题，这就是西伊里安还没有回到印度尼西亚祖国怀抱的问题。因此，为了世界的和平，特别是整个亚洲和非洲的和平，我向全体兄弟们呼吁，希望亚洲和非洲的全体工人充分关心这个问题。
    接着，我高呼：
    中国政府、人民和全体工人万岁！
    我们也没有忘记向中华全国总工会的全体负责人员表示感谢，感谢你们对我们来自印度尼西亚的代表的十分令人满意的款待。
    请允许我代表印度尼西亚工会代表团全体团员，送给中国工会第八次代表大会一点小小的礼物，并请他们站到前面来。
    这礼物虽然不怎么值钱，但是它具有重大的意义。因为这个礼物是印度尼西亚共和国的国徽，它上面写着“有区别，但又统一”。我们希望，这个礼物能够成为印度尼西亚工人和人民同中国工人和人民之间的永恒友谊的象征。
    我的话完了。谢谢！
