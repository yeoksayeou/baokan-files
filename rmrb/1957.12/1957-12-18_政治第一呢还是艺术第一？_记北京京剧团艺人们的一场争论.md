　　Politics First or Art First?
　　— A Record of a Debate Among Artists of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe
　　By Our Correspondent Wu Dajun
    For nearly a month, everyone in the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe has been living through extraordinarily unusual days. Is politics ultimately first, or is art first? This question, which has remained unresolved in the minds of many artists for years, has become the focus of everyone's daily discussions.

    Everyone has no doubt that politics can lead everything. But when specifically related to being an actor, should one prioritize politics or art? Opinions diverged. Artists freely expressed their different views and opinions in group meetings and put up big-character posters to reason their arguments. Thus, a heated debate unfolded.

    The Beijing Peking Opera Troupe's main actors are nationally renowned for their art. Their material treatment is much more generous than that of ordinary actors. Some people raised this comparison and suggested, "Art first, politics second," because "With art, you have everything." Initially, quite a few people agreed with this view, but some disagreed. Those who disagreed said that the reason our troupe leaders are loved by everyone is primarily because their art serves the people. They perform well, which means they serve the people well. Naturally, those who serve the people well should receive higher treatment. Although Li Wanchun has some artistic talent, he is a rightist. If he does not thoroughly change his reactionary stance, who would want to see his plays? His high level of art would be useless.

    Those who proposed art first also said that politics is necessary, but without art, it's over as soon as the curtain rises. With art, you can sell out the house; without art, you can't. Politics just needs to follow. Some people believe that politics comes first backstage, while art comes first on the stage. Those who opposed this view said that without art, of course, it won't work, but selling out the house can be genuine or fake. In plays like "Generals and Ministers Reconcile" and "Killing the Fisherman," the audience not only appreciates the art but also receives education. Therefore, these plays often sell out the house because they are genuinely welcomed by the audience. The fake ones, like when the repertoire was opened up, some troupes initially sold out a few performances of plays like "Ma Si Yuan" and "Killing the Son for Revenge," but later the box office sales got worse and worse. Many audience members criticized the troupe after seeing the plays, and some even wrote letters of protest. We are poisoning the audience by performing plays like this that promote violence and pornography, and the audience will not accept it. Therefore, before we perform on stage, we must first consider whether the ideological content of the play is good or not. Is art first okay? Then, someone else argued that if the politics are good but the art is not good, no matter how good the play is, no one will watch it, and it won't achieve the purpose of educating the audience. What's the use of that? Those who advocated politics first said that performing plays requires both good political content and good art. Performing plays is like politics on stage, and the audience will be influenced by it. We are literary and art workers, and people call us engineers of the soul. Can we poison the souls of the audience? The higher the art, the deeper the poisoning of the audience if a bad play is performed; the better the play, the more the audience is moved, and the greater the education the audience receives. Politics expresses positive and negative characters through the play. Only with politics can we effectively analyze the characters' personalities and emotions. For example, Xiao En in "Killing the Fisherman," we cannot perform Xiao En well without hatred for the landlord class's feelings towards the working people.

    After these debates, most artists gradually recognized the importance of politics first, and the few who insisted on art first began to doubt their own claims. However, they cited the fact that some actors from the troupe had participated in the Sixth World Youth Festival this year. Only those with better art could go abroad, and those without art could not go abroad. The amount of time spent on practice, rehearsals, and performances was much greater than the time spent listening to reports and political studies, to illustrate that art comes first. Sun Yuanxi, Hao Qinghai, He Zhenxing, and others opposed their argument, saying that first there was the World Youth Festival, and then countries needed to send youth delegations to participate. The Chinese Youth Art Troupe is first and foremost a representative of Chinese youth, and only then are they actors. Our programs introduce the diligence, bravery, and wisdom of the Chinese people, and also represent Chinese classical art and socialist culture, to promote international youth friendship and cultural exchange. This is not simply performing a play but a political task. The purpose of practice and rehearsal is to perform well to better serve the audience. Can this still be considered art first? Politics does not only refer to listening to reports and political studies. Some people also regarded some unreasonable phenomena in the troupe as art first. For example, the troupe did not have a system for reviewing and approving loan applications in the past. Sometimes it was very easy for the main actors to borrow large sums of money, while it was very troublesome for ordinary actors to borrow a few dozen yuan when they had sick family members. Some main actors did not follow the rules and brought people backstage, and staff members were scolded for trying to dissuade them. After explanations, everyone realized that these unreasonable phenomena were precisely the areas that the troupe was preparing to improve during this rectification movement by listening to everyone's opinions. Without the political leadership of the Party, there would be no improvement.

    Many veteran artists used their personal experiences to illustrate that politics has always been first in every era. During the warlord era, the two plays "Catching and Releasing Cao" and "Drumming and Scolding Cao" were banned because the surname Cao and Cao Kun were taboo. During the enemy-puppet period, plays such as "Wen Tianxiang" that promoted patriotism were also banned. During the Kuomintang rule, many progressive plays were suspended or banned. In our era when the people are in charge, of course, we cannot perform plays that poison ourselves.

    The comparison between the old and new societies further made everyone agree and accept the saying that politics comes first. Yao Pin said that in the past, we performed plays at night and set up cigarette stalls during the day, and we still couldn't make a living. We were called actors in society, and artists couldn't enter the examination hall for three generations. We were subject to various forms of discrimination and insult. What art are we talking about? Now we are called literary and art workers, engineers of human souls. Many artists have become people's representatives, and the government often sends us abroad. Can this still be considered art first? Qiu Shengrong said that although my income was not low in the past, prices rose every day, and life was always unstable. Only after liberation did I feel completely at ease in artistic creation. Some people also cited Kunqu Opera as an example. During the reactionary rule, Kunqu Opera was about to disappear, but under the Party's literary and art policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," Kunqu Opera received strong support from the government and has regained its youth. Many veteran artists have been properly arranged for and rescued. These all illustrate that politics comes first. Tan Fuying believed that without the leadership of the Party, it would have been impossible for him to cooperate with Ma Lianliang, Zhang Junqiu, and Qiu Shengrong. In the past, let alone cooperation, they would fight endlessly over the order of their names in the newspapers. The very existence of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe illustrates that politics comes first.

    This great debate clarified many vague and erroneous views of the artists on the relationship between politics and art. Everyone's ideological understanding has been significantly improved. The artists have personally felt that only by putting politics above art can art be effectively improved and developed. Art divorced from the leadership of politics is wrong and dangerous.

### 政治第一呢还是艺术第一？——记北京京剧团艺人们的一场争论

　　政治第一呢还是艺术第一？
　　——记北京京剧团艺人们的一场争论
　　本报记者　吴大钧
    近一个月来，北京京剧团的每一个人都生活在极其不平凡的日子里。究竟是政治第一呢，还是艺术第一？这个多年来在不少艺人的思想上一直没有解决的问题，已成了大家日常谈论的中心。
    大家对政治能领导一切，是没有什么疑问的。但当具体联系到作为一个演员，究竟是应该政治第一呢，还是艺术第一的时候，意见就有分歧了。艺人们把各自不同的看法和意见尽情地在小组会上自由发言，张贴大字报说理，于是，一场热烈的争论展开了。
    北京京剧团主要演员的艺术是全国著名的。他们的物质待遇要比一般演员优厚得多。有人就是从这种比较提出了：“艺术第一，政治第二。”因为“有了艺术就有了一切。”这种看法最初有相当多的人同意，但也有些人不同意。不同意这说法的人说，我们团的几位团长受到大家的爱戴，最重要的是他们的艺术是为人民服务的，他们演得好，也就是为人民服务得好，这当然会受到观众的欢迎。为人民服务得好的人，待遇自然也应该高些。像李万春虽然有些艺术，但是个右派分子，他如不彻底改变反动的立场，还有谁要看他的戏呢？他的艺术再高也是白搭了。
    提出艺术第一的人又说，政治是要的，但没有艺术一掀台帘就完了。有艺术就能卖满堂，没有艺术就卖不了满堂，政治只要跟上去好了。有的人则认为，在后台政治第一，在台毯上是艺术第一。反对这种意见的人说，没有艺术当然不成，但卖满堂有真有假。像演“将相和”“打渔杀家”等戏，观众看了不仅欣赏了艺术，还得到了教育，所以这些戏经常卖满堂，这是受到观众真正的欢迎的；假的像剧目开放的时候，有的剧团最初演出几场“马思远”“杀子报”等戏也卖了满堂，后来卖座就越来越差，很多观众看了戏就批评剧团，有的还写信提出抗议。我们演这种宣扬凶杀、色情的戏是毒害观众，观众是不会答应的。所以，我们在台毯上演戏先要考虑这戏的思想内容好不好，艺术第一行吗？接着，又有人认为，光政治好，艺术不好，再好的戏也没有什么人看，也就达不到教育观众的目的，那又有什么用呢？主张政治第一的人说，演戏既要政治内容好，又要艺术好，演戏就是舞台上的政治，观众看了就要受影响。我们是文艺工作者，人们称我们是灵魂工程师，难道我们能去毒害观众的灵魂吗？艺术高，演的是坏戏，那么毒害观众也深；演好戏，越能感动观众，观众受的教育也越大。政治通过戏来表达正反人物，有了政治才能很好分析人物的性格和思想情感。如“打渔杀家”中的萧恩，我们如果没有仇恨地主阶级的劳动人民情感，萧恩准是演不好的。
    经过了这些争辩，大多数艺人渐渐认识到政治第一的重要，少数坚持艺术第一的人对自己的主张也开始怀疑了。但他们又从剧团里今年曾有部分演员参加第六届世界青年联欢节，艺术较好的才能出国，没有艺术不能出国和练工、排戏、演戏的业务时间比听报告、政治学习的时间多得多来说明艺术第一。孙元喜、郝庆海、何振兴等都反对他们说，先有世界青年联欢节，才需各国派青年代表团去参加。中国青年艺术团首先是中国青年的代表，然后才是演员。我们的节目都是介绍中国人民的勤劳、勇敢和智慧的，也代表了中国的古典艺术，社会主义文化，来促进国际间青年的友谊和文化交流，这决不是单纯去演戏而是一个政治任务。练工、排戏的目的就是为了演好戏来更好的为观众演出，这还算是艺术第一吗？政治决不是单指一些听报告和政治学习。还有些人把剧团里的一些不合理的现象也看作艺术第一。如剧团里过去没有建立起借钱的审核、批准办法，有时主要演员借大笔的钱很方便，一般演员家中有病人借几十元钱也很麻烦。有的主要演员没有很好遵守制度带人去后台，工作人员劝阻还挨了骂等等，经过了解释，大家才认识到这些不合理的现象正是剧团这次整风运动中准备听取大家的意见来改进的地方，如果没有党的政治领导，是决不会改进的。
    很多老艺人用亲身的经历来说明无论什么时代都是政治第一。在军阀时期，“捉放曹”“击鼓骂曹”二出戏因曹和曹锟的姓字讳忌而被禁演，敌伪时期“文天祥”等宣传爱国主义精神的戏也是被禁演的，国民党统治时，则有很多进步的戏被停演、禁演。我们人民自己当家的时代当然也不能演出毒害自己的戏。
    用新旧社会的对比，更进一步使大家同意并心服了政治第一的说法。姚品一说，过去我们晚上演戏，白天摆香烟摊，这样还维持不了生活，在社会上被称为戏子，艺人三辈子进不了考场，受到各种歧视和侮辱，还谈什么艺术？现在我们被称为文艺工作者，人类灵魂工程师，很多艺人当上了人民代表，政府还常派我们出国，这些难道还是艺术第一吗？裘盛戎说，我过去收入虽然不少，但物价天天上涨，生活一直是不安定的，只有在解放后，我才完全安心于艺术创造。还有些人举出昆曲作为例子说，在反动统治时期，昆曲已快消失了，但在党的“百花齐放、推陈出新”的文艺方针下，昆曲受到政府大力的扶植，已恢复了它的青春，很多老艺人都受到妥善的安排和救济，这些都说明了政治第一。谭富英认为，如果没有党的领导，他和马连良、张君秋、裘盛戎合作根本是不可能的，过去不要说合作，就是登报名字前后次序也是争个不休。北京京剧团存在的这件事本身，也说明了政治第一。
    这一场大争辩澄清了艺人们对政治和艺术的关系中很多模糊和错误的观点，大家的思想认识都显著的提高了，艺人们已切身感到只有把政治放在艺术之上，艺术才能很好的提高、发展，艺术脱离了政治的领导是错误的，也是危险的。
