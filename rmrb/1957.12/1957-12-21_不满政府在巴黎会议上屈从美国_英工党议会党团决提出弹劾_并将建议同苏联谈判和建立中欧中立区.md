Xinhua News Agency, London, 20th: News - The British Labour Party Parliamentary Group met on the 19th and decided to propose an impeachment motion against the British government's policies at the Paris Conference during the House of Commons debate today.

Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, Bevan, criticized the communiqué of the Paris North Atlantic Group summit in his speech at the meeting. He said that this communiqué "excessively emphasized military issues," and its wording on the issue of holding negotiations with the Soviet Union was "vague" and "lacked new initiatives." It "did not put forward new proposals" in resolving the German question and the disarmament issue; at the same time, Britain abandoned some of its sovereignty while its opponents did not do so, because Britain had no control over the hydrogen bombs carried by American aircraft taking off from its bases, or the nuclear warheads of the missiles to be deployed in Britain.

Bevan also stated that in the House of Commons debate, he would put forward the Labour Party's "constructive proposals" on the following two issues: first, the question of establishing a neutral zone in Central Europe; second, the question of reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union on the situation in the Middle East.

At this meeting, Labour members of Parliament unanimously demanded that negotiations with the Soviet Union must "proceed in the direction of establishing a demilitarized zone in Central Europe," and they unanimously expressed their opposition to establishing ballistic missile bases in West Germany and providing missiles to West Germany.

    不满政府在巴黎会议上屈从美国
    英工党议会党团决提出弹劾
    并将建议同苏联谈判和建立中欧中立区
    据新华社20日讯  伦敦消息：英国工党议会党团19日开会决定在今天举行的下院辩论中对英国政府在巴黎会议上所执行的政策提出弹劾。
    工党外交问题发言人比万在这次会议上的发言中批评了巴黎北大西洋集团最高级会议的公报。他说：这份公报“过分着重军事问题”，在关于同苏联举行谈判的问题上措辞“含糊”、“没有新的倡议”，在解决德国问题和裁军问题方面都“没有提出新的建议”；同时，英国放弃了它的一部分主权而它的对手却没有这样做，因为英国对于那些从它的基地上起飞的美国飞机所携带的氢弹以及将要在英国设置的导弹的核弹头都没有控制权。
    比万还表示，在下院辩论中，他将要提出工党在下述两个问题上的“建设性的建议”，即：一、建立一个欧洲中部的中立地区的问题；二、同苏联就中东局势达成协议的问题。
    在这次会议上，工党议员们一致要求，同苏联举行的谈判必须“朝着在中欧建立一个非军事地区这个方向进行”，他们并且一致表示反对在西德建立弹道导弹基地和把导弹给予西德。
