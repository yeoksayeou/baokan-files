Xinhua News Agency, December 21st:

    The national railways have completed this year's passenger and freight transportation plans fifty-two days and twenty-two days ahead of schedule, respectively. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the railway department will have transported over 310 million passengers, an increase of about 25% compared to last year; the freight volume completed will reach approximately 270 million tons, an increase of more than 11% compared to last year.
    The transportation tasks of major materials such as steel, coal, coke, petroleum, grain, timber, metallic ores, and mineral building materials have all been completed or overfulfilled ahead of schedule. Compared with 1952, the year before the First Five-Year Plan, this year's freight volume (in tons) has increased by more than twofold. Passenger volume has increased by more than 93%.
    The characteristics of this year's railway transportation are large volumes, especially heavy transportation tasks in some areas, but the transportation order is better than in previous years.
    In order to better complete this year's national freight plan, the railway department has taken many measures.
    The first is to strengthen the organization of planned transportation, especially balanced transportation. Given the large transportation volume this year and the insufficient capacity of some railway sections and stations, organizing balanced transportation is of great significance for effectively using transportation capacity and ensuring the completion of transportation tasks. Coal transportation accounts for about one-third of the total railway transportation volume. In the first half of last year, only 47% of the annual coal transportation volume was completed, so coal transportation was very tight in the second half of the year. This year, learning from this lesson, and with the assistance of the coal and commercial departments, 51% of the coal transportation plan was completed in the first half of the year, which played a significant role in alleviating the tight coal transportation situation in the second half of the year.
    Cooperation between the railway department's upper and lower levels, with each other, and internally and externally has also been strengthened. Since January this year, the Ministry of Railways, each Railway Administration, and branch bureaus have implemented a joint duty system for transportation-related departments such as train operations, freight, rolling stock, and locomotives to strengthen communication, eliminate departmentalism, and establish the view of comprehensively completing tasks. In the past, each bureau only paid attention to loading cars because the number of cars loaded was one of the main indicators for completing the plan. They did not pay attention to unloading cars. This year, each Railway Administration has paid attention to implementing the slogan "unload first, then evacuate, then load" put forward by the Ministry of Railways. This slogan means that each bureau should first ensure unloading, then send the cars out after unloading to ensure that other bureaus can load, and finally load their own cars. This measure has changed the phenomenon of frequent unloading backlogs and congested traffic jams that occurred frequently last year.
    On the basis of cooperation, various departments have also jointly studied and adopted many technical and organizational measures to improve transportation capacity this year.
    Although the number of passengers transported by railways this year has increased by more than 60 million compared with last year, from the perspective of passenger transportation work, the chaotic situation of last year has been basically reversed. On the one hand, this is because the railway department has learned from last year's lessons, conducted passenger flow surveys before holidays, and made preparations in advance, thus preventing the shortcomings of being caught off guard at that time. However, the main reason is that the broad masses of people have responded to the call of the state to suspend and advance Spring Festival travel, which has reduced the difficulty of the railway in transporting passengers during the Spring Festival. In addition, due to the in-depth development of the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, the staggered dates of school holidays have changed the phenomenon that excessive concentration of passenger flow affected passenger ticket purchases and boarding difficulties in the past. These factors have all promoted the balance of railway passenger transportation work. In order to facilitate the daily commute of urban and suburban residents, more than 50 pairs of suburban trains have been added this year, which has also played a significant role in overfulfilling the annual passenger transportation plan.

### 旅客三亿多人  货运二亿多吨  全国铁路提前完成今年客货运计划

    旅客三亿多人  货运二亿多吨
    全国铁路提前完成今年客货运计划
    据新华社21日讯  全国铁路已经分别提前五十二天和二十二天完成了今年的客运和货运计划。预计到今年年底，铁路部门在这一年中发送的旅客将达到三亿一千多万人，比去年增长25％左右；完成的货运量将达到二亿七千万吨左右，比去年增长11％多。
    钢铁、煤、焦炭、石油、粮食、木材、金属矿石和矿物性建筑材料等主要物资的运输任务都已提前完成或超额完成，同第一个五年计划的前一年——1952年比较，今年的货运量（以吨计）增长了一倍以上。客运量增长93％多。
    今年铁路运输的特点是运量大，特别是某些地区的运输任务很繁重，但是运输秩序却比往年好。
    为了更好地完成今年国家的货运计划，铁道部门采取了许多措施。
    首先是加强计划运输特别是均衡运输的组织工作。鉴于今年运输量大，而铁路若干区段和车站的能力已呈现不足，因此，组织均衡运输对于有效使用运输力和保证完成运输任务具有很大的意义。煤炭的运量占铁路总运量的三分之一左右。去年上半年只完成煤炭全年运输量的47％，因而下半年煤运就很紧张。今年吸取了这个教训，在煤炭和商业部门的协助下，上半年就完成了煤运计划的51％，这对缓和下半年煤运紧张情况起了很大作用。
    铁道部门上下、彼此和内外之间的协作也加强了。今年1月起，铁道部、各管理局和分局都实行车务、货运、车辆和机务等有关运输部门联合值班的制度，以加强联系，消除本位主义，树立全面完成任务的观点。过去各局只注意装车，因为装车数是完成计划的主要指标之一。对于卸车工作却不重视。今年各铁路管理局都注意贯彻了铁道部提出的“一卸、二排、三装”的口号。这个口号的意思是，各局要首先保证卸车，卸完后把车送出去，保证别的局装车，最后才是自己装车。这个措施改变了去年经常卸车积压、车流拥挤堵塞的现象。
    在协作的基础上，各个部门今年还共同研究采取了许多提高运输能力的技术措施和组织措施。
    今年铁路发送旅客虽较去年增加六千多万人，但从旅客运输工作看，却基本上扭转了去年的混乱现象。一方面是由于铁路部门吸取了去年的教训，在节假日前进行了客流调查，事先做了准备工作，这样就防止了到时措手不及的缺点。但是主要的还是由于广大人民群众响应国家的号召，中止和提前春节旅行，这样就减少了铁路在春节期间输送旅客的困难。此外，由于反右派斗争及整风运动的深入进展，各学校放假日期的错开，改变了以往因为客流过度集中以致影响旅客购票、上车发生困难的现象。这些因素都促进了铁路旅客运输工作的均衡性。为了便利城市与郊区居民的日常来往，在今年内铁路共增开了五十多对市郊列车，对超额完成全年客运计划也起了很大的作用。（附图片）
