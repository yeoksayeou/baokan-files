Three Questions on Water Conservancy Construction
    —An Interview with Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    By our reporter Yu Ming
    Anhui Province is a disaster-prone area, suffering from either floods or droughts every year. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the province have made tremendous achievements in water conservancy construction and gained a lot of experience.
    The reporter recently interviewed Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. He began by saying to the reporter that the achievements in Anhui's water conservancy work would have been even greater if it had not taken detours. He said that from the ideological struggle to reverse these detours, we deeply realized that in order to do a good job in water conservancy, we must correctly understand the following three issues: the purpose of water conservancy construction, who to rely on in water conservancy construction, and the methods of water conservancy construction.
    What is the purpose of water conservancy construction?
    Comrade Zeng Xisheng said that the overall purpose is, of course, to turn water hazards into water benefits, that is, to eliminate harm and promote benefits. Everyone knows this. But what harm to eliminate, and what benefits to promote? The issue of primary and secondary importance, and the issue of priority, are often the focus of debate.
    First, there is the issue of flood control and drainage of waterlogging. Both floods and waterlogging are serious water disasters. It stands to reason that those who manage water should attach importance to both flood control and waterlogging drainage. However, in actual work, there is a traditional view that water management is only for flood control, and ensuring that floods do not break through the dikes is considered the completion of the water management task, or that flood control is the same as waterlogging drainage. This has led to a simple emphasis on flood control, ignoring the people's demand for waterlogging drainage.
    In fact, waterlogging is a greater threat to the masses in Anhui. As the saying goes, "A chronic disease is worse than an acute disease." What is a chronic disease in the human body? It is tuberculosis. And in terms of water hazards, this disease is waterlogging. Looking at the disasters in Anhui since liberation, only 1954 can be considered a true flood disaster, while waterlogging occurs every year, and it is even more severe in flood years. In 1953, it was originally a year of continuous spring and summer droughts, but there were still more than 3 million mu of farmland in northern Anhui suffering from waterlogging. From 1950 to this year, the area in northern Anhui affected by flood disasters averaged only 3.14 million mu per year. What about waterlogging? The average is more than 10 million mu per year! The average annual loss of grain due to waterlogging in Anhui Province reaches 2.16 billion jin, totaling nearly 20 billion jin in nine years; however, the loss of grain due to floods is only more than 12 billion jin. It can be seen that it is wrong to simply emphasize flood control and ignore waterlogging drainage.
    Taking the Huai River management as an example, it was absolutely necessary to focus on "flood control and dike protection" in the first two years, which was an important step in managing the Huai River well. However, simply "flood control and dike protection" cannot achieve the goal of fundamentally controlling the Huai River. Because it still cannot solve the problem of waterlogging. Our water management should not focus solely on dike protection but should emphasize ensuring harvests. Although the dikes can ensure that they do not break, if waterlogging is not resolved to a certain extent, agriculture can still suffer serious losses, which does not achieve the basic purpose of "ensuring harvests." After several years of ideological struggle and practical lessons, the idea of only focusing on flood control and ignoring waterlogging drainage has been basically reversed, but another bias may arise, namely, focusing on waterlogging drainage while ignoring key flood control projects. For example, the large-scale control project proposed by the Huai River Commission is absolutely necessary to handle the large amount of water coming from Henan, but some cadres in Fuyang do not agree with this measure, believing that too much land is being flooded, which is not worthwhile. In fact, it is obvious that sacrificing a small area is necessary to protect a large area, so flood control and waterlogging drainage must be well combined to further expand the area of ensured harvest.
    Secondly, there is the issue of preventing water disasters and drought disasters. The purpose of water conservancy construction is to prevent water and drought disasters. It stands to reason that those who manage water should attach great importance to the prevention of these two types of disasters. However, in actual work, people pay more attention to water disasters and less attention to drought disasters. There may be two reasons for this: one is that water disasters come fiercely, and cities and towns can be turned into ruins, which makes people afraid. China has always said: "Floods are worse than fierce beasts." As for drought disasters, although they occur every year, there is always a certain harvest under normal circumstances. The masses in northern Anhui say: "We are more afraid of being flooded than being drought-stricken" and "We can still eat even if there is a drought." In addition, drought years are indeed less frequent than years of heavy flooding. Therefore, the masses have a fear of water but not of drought. However, from the perspective of the entire province, as long as a simple calculation is made, it will be found that the grain loss due to drought disasters is not much less than the grain loss due to water disasters.
    According to historical records, there have been more than 980 major and minor disasters along the Huai River in the past two thousand years, of which drought disasters account for about half, and are no less frequent than water disasters. According to incomplete statistics from Bengbu and northern Anhui before 1947, there were 13 spring droughts, 7 summer droughts, 10 autumn droughts, and 17 winter droughts, totaling 47 seasonal droughts in 34 years. The main agricultural products in northern Anhui are wheat and soybeans, and these two crops often cannot be sown in time due to drought, what is the extent of this loss? According to veteran farmers, wheat yields will decrease by 10% if sown 10 days late; and by 50% if sown one month late; soybean yields will decrease by 40% to 50% if sown 20 days late. In 1953, the province suffered a severe drought, and the grain harvest was reduced by 2.1 billion jin in one year. Since liberation, the average annual grain loss due to drought disasters in the province has reached 750 million jin. This is only a statistic of crops with a yield reduction of more than 30%. If general drought conditions, with a reduction of several tens of jin per mu, are included, the total yield reduction in the province will be more than 1 billion jin, which may be greater than the grain loss suffered by the state in a local area affected by water disasters, but this is not noticed by people. At present, the yield of drought-resistant crops is very low, and the area of drought-resistant crops is also very large (drought-resistant crops are twice as many as water-requiring crops). If we want to complete the targets set in the Agricultural Development Program, we must first increase the yield of drought-resistant crops to several hundred jin, and we must change many areas that can be planted with rice to rice cultivation before it is possible, otherwise, this requirement will be difficult. Therefore, it is particularly important to vigorously overcome the idea of neglecting drought prevention in the future.
    Third, there is the issue of disaster prevention and comprehensive utilization. Comprehensive utilization is a necessary measure to eliminate harm and promote benefits, which is absolutely necessary. However, there are also issues of priority and importance in comprehensive utilization. Taking the specific situation in Anhui as an example, what is most closely related to the masses and what the masses urgently need should be irrigation projects that enable agriculture to "ensure harvest" and "increase production." However, in the past, we did not conduct serious research on this actual situation. Some people researched it, but did not pay attention to this most basic requirement of the masses, and lacked the spirit of decisiveness, and were often swayed by seemingly reasonable but actually wrong ideas. For example, some people emphasized that eliminating harm comes first and promoting benefits comes second, resulting in the relaxation of necessary benefit-promoting projects. Some people overemphasized comprehensive utilization, treating disaster prevention, irrigation, power generation, and shipping equally, which diluted the most urgently needed irrigation projects, such as water-blocking gates on many small rivers, which are projects that cost little and have great benefits, but have been rarely built in recent years. Sometimes, the cheapest benefit-promoting projects have already been planned, but there are wavering during construction, or they are done too small and cause rework and waste. In short, we have not grasped the issue of disaster prevention and comprehensive utilization firmly, which has led to the premature implementation of some projects that should have been carried out later, or only the main projects have been done without the auxiliary projects, so the comprehensive utilization is not fully utilized, and it does not help much in ensuring and increasing agricultural production. This situation makes us deeply feel that in the work of water conservancy construction, we should clarify the main purpose according to the local and current situation, and carry out the work step by step after distinguishing between primary and secondary importance.
    In short, water conservancy construction should combine the three purposes of "flood control and dike protection," "waterlogging drainage and harvest guarantee," and "irrigation and production increase," and consider the issues in a comprehensive and balanced manner, without focusing on one aspect and neglecting the other.
    Who should we rely on?
    Comrade Zeng Xisheng believes that the struggle against nature is even larger in scale than the struggle against the enemy, so the question of who to rely on must be clarified. He said that everyone can answer that water conservancy construction should rely on the masses. However, judging from the situation in Anhui Province, many people are still unclear about this in actual work even now.
    He said that relying on the masses in all work, using political education to mobilize the masses, and overcoming difficulties with the spirit of self-reliance are the basic principles that the Party has consistently taught us. However, we often violate these principles in actual work, especially in water conservancy work, which is the most prominent. He cited many specific materials from the water conservancy work conferences and water conservancy work practices in Anhui in recent years to illustrate this issue. He said that from these conferences and the water conservancy work practices in recent years, it can be seen that many comrades have the following incorrect ideas:
    First, they do not rely on the strength and wisdom of the masses, but only rely on the state's money to solve problems. In the meetings, they do not introduce the experience of mobilizing the masses to fight against disasters, but only ask the state for money, sometimes arguing red-faced over the issue of hundreds of thousands or millions of yuan. They do not believe in the strength of the masses, nor do they understand that the state is building heavy industry and should save money for the state. We have conducted some criticism on this issue this year, so it is much better than in previous years. For example, the original budget for this winter and next spring was more than 400 million cubic meters of earthwork, but it later increased to 800-900 million cubic meters. This figure is twice that of the peak of collectivization, three times that of 1957, and more than twice the original calculation. However, they did not ask the province to increase funding. If all of them were to be invested by the state, it would require 0.3 yuan per cubic meter, that is, 240 million to 270 million yuan. If calculated based on the increased earthwork, it would also require more than 120 million yuan. What a large amount this is! Where does the state have so much money!
    In fact, relying on the strength of the masses, without relying on the state's money, water conservancy projects have been carried out very well in many places. In the spring of 1956, more than 120,000 wells were dug in northern Anhui, all of which were funded by the masses to exchange materials and build bricks on their own. In the spring of 1956, according to the "those who have strength contribute strength, evaluate work and record points; those who have money contribute money, record accounts and pay interest, and repay in installments" policy, Bo County launched the investment campaign of "ten million bricks, one million yuan," and solved the difficulties of insufficient funds and materials in the county by relying on its own efforts, completing 26,000 various wells, which can irrigate about 390,000 mu, calculating 13 mu per well. Dozens of weirs were built in Yingshang County this spring, most of which were built by the masses themselves, without asking the government for money. Many agricultural cooperatives, such as Fuxing Township in Chaoxian County and Xianfeng Cooperative in Feidong County, have relied on their own strength and solved ordinary water and drought disasters without state investment. Not only can small-scale farmland water conservancy projects be done this way, but large-scale projects can also absorb civil labor support. For example, the unfinished 200,000 cubic meters of earthwork of the Dongbu Reservoir in Hefei originally required the province to supplement funding. After the slogan of relying on the masses was put forward, this requirement was automatically cancelled.
    Second, they do not rely on political education work but rely on coercion and command and rely on wages to solve problems. This phenomenon did not exist in the initial stage of the Huai River management. At that time, political education work was done more carefully, and the laborers voluntarily signed up to go to the dikes. Although the wages were low, the engineering tasks were completed relatively quickly. Later, political education work was relaxed, the masses' understanding of the importance and arduousness of water conservancy work was insufficient, especially the bureaucracy and capitalist ideas of cadres grew, so the phenomenon of laborers escaping and some coercive commandism of cadres in mobilizing laborers to go to the dikes occurred first. At the same time, due to the influence of the excessively high wages of laborers in some areas, political education work was further relaxed, resulting in a tendency to rely on the method of increasing wages to solve problems. For example, the initial wage for Huai River management laborers was 3 jin of raw grain per day, which gradually increased to 0.85 yuan, about three times higher than the original. Is such a wage standard necessary? If political work is done well, it can be reduced. This year, we reduced the wage to 0.6 yuan per day. Because we conducted education centered on the Agricultural Development Program, not only did we have no objection to the reduction of 0.25 yuan, but the masses also automatically decided to do about 70% more work on the basis of the 0.6 yuan per day wage. But what was the situation of relying on wages to solve problems in the past? Let's take an example to illustrate: A bridge was built on the new Feihe River. Building the bridge was for the convenience of the local masses, and it could have been built by the masses themselves, but the Huai River Commission paid for it. After the bridge was built, the two banks of the bridge were lower than the bridge deck. It only needed to be filled with some soil to be unobstructed, but because it was built with the investment of the Huai River Commission, the masses would rather a few people lift the carts from one end of the bridge to the bridge deck and then lift them down at the other end, than carry soil themselves to fill the low land at both ends, and the local cadres did not care. The person in charge of the Bengbu Special Zone passed this bridge, saw this strange phenomenon, and asked the masses why they did not fill the soil. They said that this was a project of the Huai River Commission. Filling is possible, but money is needed! It can be seen that relying solely on money cannot do things well, but will also foster the dependence of cadres and promote the capitalist ideas of the masses. This is worth noting.
    Third, they do not rely on themselves but only rely on others. This phenomenon is very serious in counties, districts, and townships. The counties, districts, and townships located upstream always want to discharge the local floods to the downstream counties, districts, and townships, and they are unwilling to store water themselves because they are afraid of sacrificing land. However, during droughts, the counties, districts, and townships located downstream always compete for water with the upstream counties, districts, and townships, blaming them for not providing water for irrigation. Because they do not rely on their own efforts to overcome difficulties, water disputes often occur, especially during droughts and when the flood season arrives, the disputes are particularly tense. In the past two years, we have criticized this idea of harming others to benefit oneself, and proposed that eliminating water disasters should be like eliminating enemy paratroopers, eliminate them wherever they land. Provinces, counties, districts, townships, and cooperatives should all prevent floods, and they should all prepare water for drought prevention, so there are fewer disputes than before.
    As mentioned above, relying on the masses, relying on political education work, and relying on self-reliance are the basic principles of the Party, but because our cadres have localism and capitalist ideas, they often contradict these principles in actual work. I believe that water conservancy work should also be regarded as one of the key points of inspection in the rectification campaign, which will greatly help the development of water conservancy work in the future.
    The method of water conservancy construction
    Comrade Zeng Xisheng said, "Less money, quick results, and great benefits" is the general requirement for water conservancy construction. Based on this requirement, the following issues regarding past water management methods are worth discussing.
    The first is the question of whether large, medium, and small projects should be the main or secondary focus. Large, medium, and small projects are mutually supportive in water conservancy. With small projects but without large projects, the small projects cannot be supported and guaranteed in years of especially large floods or droughts. With only large and medium-sized projects, without a large number of small projects, the large projects are isolated and can only play a role in flood control, not irrigation. Therefore, key large-scale projects are indispensable, but the central government's policy of focusing on small projects is completely correct. As long as these projects are compared, it will become clear.
    Large-scale projects, such as large reservoirs and large controls, have the advantage of having control capabilities and being able to control a large area, with a large role in flood control. However, the disadvantage is that they cost a lot of money and the results are not quick. Large reservoirs take a considerable amount of time to build. After the project is completed and water is stored, its role cannot always be shown. Because there is no need for flood storage under normal circumstances, and in drought years, the lack of small and medium-sized projects prevents the water from being delivered to the fields. For example, the Meishan Reservoir, in the years after its completion, except for one year when it played a flood storage role, its other functions were not seen. Originally, this reservoir was supposed to irrigate millions of mu of farmland, but because the large water diversion channels have not been built, the reservoir has been unable to exert its intended irrigation effect on farmland for several years. Medium-sized projects are also the same. For example, building gates on rivers is powerless without the cooperation of small-scale projects. However, small-scale farmland water conservancy projects are different. A pond or a well can play a role in ordinary years, and the earthwork done in the same year can play a role in the same year.
    This is one aspect. On the other hand, because small-scale farmland water conservancy projects are mass projects, these projects are close to villages and easy to build. The strength of the broad masses can be used. This year, we have more than 10 million laborers building these projects, which is due to the small-scale farmland water conservancy. Otherwise, it would be impossible to use such a large number of laborers. At the same time, small-scale projects (such as ditches, ponds, and wells) are also very convenient to use water. They can both accumulate rainwater and absorb groundwater. Another aspect is that it can save a lot of funds for the country. Taking the medium and small-sized projects done in Anhui since liberation as an example, small-scale projects have done a total of 1.15 billion cubic meters of earthwork, and medium-sized projects have done more than 32 million cubic meters of basic construction. However, the cost of small-scale projects (state subsidies and investment) is less than one cent per cubic meter, while medium-sized projects cost 0.5 yuan per cubic meter, a difference of nearly 50 times! (The cost of large-scale projects is even higher!) And the irrigated farmland is 15.87 million mu irrigated by small-scale projects, and only more than 970,000 mu irrigated by medium-sized projects. It can be seen that only focusing on small-scale projects meets the requirements of large benefits, quick results, and less money. However, some people are now biased towards the other side, thinking that large-scale projects are not needed at all, which is certainly wrong.
    The second is the issue of water storage and water discharge. The central government has long proposed the policy of comprehensive planning for water storage and discharge, with water storage as the main focus, which is correct. However, in water conservancy construction, we often focus on water discharge and ignore water storage; or we build large water storage projects and few people pay attention to taking small-scale projects to store water. Why are they afraid of storing water? This is because they have not clarified the reason for water disasters. In fact, the reason why the area north of the Huai River is often plagued by water disasters is not that there is too much water, but that the water in the large water years is not stored, and the crops are changed to water-requiring crops. If northern Anhui can store the excess water, change a large amount of dry land to paddy fields, and turn northern Anhui into a water network area, then the so-called flood disasters that occur once every ten or twenty years can be eliminated. Production can also be greatly increased. Therefore, the situation of neglecting water storage should be changed quickly and effectively.
    But how should we store water? Some people advocate storing water at points and lines and building large-scale projects. Key large-scale water storage projects are of course needed and indispensable. However, simply building this type of project still cannot solve the problem of water and drought disasters in a wide area. Facts have proved that many large reservoirs and large-scale flood storage projects in low-lying areas along the Huai River have been built, and they do have flood control and water storage functions, which can ensure that floods of the 1954 type will not collapse. However, they cannot solve the situation that the area north of the Huai River is still either flooded or drought-stricken every year, and cannot guarantee agricultural harvests well. This is because large-scale flood storage projects in low-lying areas can only solve the invasion of external water and cannot solve the outlet for internal water.
    To cure water disasters in a wide area and eliminate the constant drought disasters, we must adopt a governance policy that focuses on treating the surface area and combines points and lines, and we must take measures to store water in a wide area in addition to storing water at points and lines. The person in charge of the Huai River project once preliminarily calculated the water storage potential of northern Anhui. The 45 million mu of cultivated land in northern Anhui can store a total of 6.5 billion cubic meters of water. The amount of water stored by digging wells has not yet been calculated. This is of course a cautious and low calculation, and the actual amount is more than this. However, taking this water storage function alone, its water storage capacity is more than ten times larger than that of the Foziling Reservoir (the Foziling Reservoir stores about 500 million cubic meters). This shows that water storage should focus on the surface area. Only when water is arranged on a wide surface area can disasters be effectively prevented. Therefore, we should rely on the broad masses to build small-scale projects.
    Comrade Zeng Xisheng pointed out that the water storage of these small-scale projects is not only large in quantity and saves money, but also is the most effective way to prevent floods, waterlogging, and drought disasters, and is a way to combine eliminating harm and promoting benefits and use local water for local purposes. In addition to this, there are many other benefits, such as the regulation of climate and the change of environment, which are not as effective as several large projects. He turned back to the importance of combining point and surface water storage. He said that although water storage projects on a wide surface area have countless benefits, they still have a serious weakness. In years with little rainfall, point and line water storage are needed to assist. In years with large rainfall, points and lines are needed to help with drainage and water storage. The water storage on the surface area can reduce the burden on point and line projects, but if point and line projects are neglected, the surface area water storage projects will also be damaged in the event of a particularly large flood with the danger of dike breaches. Therefore, focusing on surface area storage, combined with point and line water storage, is a relatively safe and comprehensive method.
    Comrade Zeng Xisheng also talked about the relationship between treating the main stream and treating the tributaries. He said that it is necessary to treat the main stream well, but the water in the main stream comes from many tributaries. If we only focus on treating the main stream and ignore the treatment of the tributaries, we cannot manage the water well. This kind of problem occurred in the initial stage of the Huai River management.
    Based on Anhui's experience, Comrade Zeng Xisheng also told reporters about some specific methods of building small-scale water conservancy projects. What small-scale water conservancy projects should be done in water conservancy construction? What is the best way to do it? He said that various different regions have small-scale projects that meet local needs. For example, in mountainous and hilly areas, we generally build mountain valley reservoirs, valley dams, ponds, dikes, terraced fields, and other soil and water conservation projects to store water and block sand; in plains, we dig wells, pick ponds, and make ditches, ditches, and ridge fields to store water and prevent drought; in low-lying areas, we build weirs to change planting and make platform fields to resist external water; in polder areas, we build water lifting projects to strengthen drainage and irrigation. Talking about this, he also introduced his several experiences in doing small projects as follows.
    In terms of digging ditches in plain areas, he said that there are three types of ditches: large, medium, and small. Generally speaking, all of them are needed, but medium ditches should be the main focus, and deep ditches should be dug. Because small ditches are for diverting water in farmland, they have no drainage and storage function, and are seasonal temporary projects, which belong to the scope of cultivation. Although large ditches can drain and store water, the ditch surface is too wide, which is labor-intensive. The role of medium ditches is greater than that of large ditches. First, because two or three medium ditches can replace one large ditch, but one large ditch cannot replace two or three medium ditches. The medium ditch connects a wide area of cultivated land, and the area for absorbing groundwater is also large. Drainage and irrigation are more convenient than large ditches. Planting trees next to the ditch can not only change the climate, but also accumulate fertilizer. Second, the ditch surface width of the medium ditch is not as large as that of the large ditch, the soil transportation distance is short, and it is easy to excavate. For the same drainage and storage area, it requires less labor than the large ditch. Third, digging medium ditches is convenient for the masses, because they do not need to be too far from home, and they can work in the morning and evening.
    In terms of digging ponds: He said that the old Chinese ponds are square ponds and round ponds. These ponds should not be used unless they are formed by topographic conditions. The reason is still that the transportation distance is long, the labor is more expensive, and the area of cultivated land it connects is not large, and the amount of groundwater absorbed is not much. Now, many places have changed square ponds and round ponds into long ponds, which is much better. The long pond is like a section of a ditch, with a short transportation distance, which saves labor, and its greatest benefit is that the area connected to the underground and above ground is larger than that of square ponds and round ponds. In addition, in areas with abundant groundwater, ponds with lower springs or ditches with lower springs have been proven to be a good way to use groundwater, and they are all worth promoting.
    In terms of building weirs in low-lying areas to change planting to rice, he said that there were few supporters for this method at first, but after many persuasions and investigations in water network areas, it was accepted by the water conservancy department. Now some achievements have been made in northern Anhui, proving that it can be used wherever there is external water invasion and no place to arrange internal water.
    Comrade Zeng Xisheng also talked about his experiences in establishing drainage and irrigation projects in polder areas and promoting terraced fields in mountainous areas.
    Comrade Zeng Xisheng finally said that the above is a little experience gained from several years of water conservancy work in Anhui, which lacks thorough research and must have many mistakes. He also said that if we want to strive to take fewer detours in water conservancy work, an important way is to study the water management experience of our country for thousands of years. He said that our country's water management experience is very rich, and the polder fields along the Yangtze River are an important part of it. According to the amount of rainfall along the Yangtze River every year, it is much more than that of northern Anhui, but because the polder field project is done well there, not only are there fewer disasters, but also the harvest is high. It can be seen that it is extremely important to study our country's water conservancy experience.

　　兴修水利中的三个问题
　　——访中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣同志
    本报记者　于明
    安徽省是一个多灾的地区，年年不涝即旱，解放以来，全省人民在党的领导下，兴修水利取得巨大成绩，并获得了不少经验。
    记者最近访问了中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣同志。他开头就对记者说，安徽水利工作如果不走弯路，成绩还要大一些。他说，从扭转这些弯路所进行的思想斗争实践中，使我们深深体会到，要想把水利工作做好，要正确认识以下三个问题：兴修水利的目的，兴修水利中依靠谁，兴修水利的方法。
    兴修水利的目的何在？
    曾希圣同志说，总的目的当然是要变水害为水利，也就是除害兴利。这是人人都知道的。但除什么害，兴什么利？主次问题，先后问题，常常是争论的焦点。
    首先是关于防治洪水和内涝的问题。洪水和内涝都是严重的水灾。按理说，治水的人应该是既重视防洪又重视除涝的。但在实际工作中有一种因袭传统的观点，他们认为治水就是为了防洪，保证洪水不冲破堤防，就算完成了治水任务，或是认为防治了洪水就是除了涝灾。这就产生了一种单纯强调防洪的思想，忽视了群众除涝的要求。
    其实，涝灾在安徽对群众的威胁更大。俗语说，“长病重于短病”，什么是人身上的长病呢？就是痨病。而在水害方面，这个病就是涝灾。以安徽解放以来的灾害来看，九年中只有1954年一年算是真正的洪水灾害，而涝灾则每年都有，在洪水年份涝灾更大。1953年本是春夏旱灾延续的年景，淮北仍有三百多万亩农田受涝。淮北从1950年到今年受洪水灾害的面积，合计起来平均每年只有三百一十四万亩。内涝呢？平均每年在一千万亩以上！安徽全省平均每年因涝灾的损失达到二十一亿六千万斤粮食，九年合计共损失近二百亿斤；但因洪水而损失的粮食则只有一百二十多亿斤。由此可见，单纯强调防洪而忽视防涝是错误的。
    以治淮来说，在最初两年，把主要力量放在“防洪保堤”上，是完全必要的，这是治好淮河的一个重要步骤。但是，仅仅“防洪保堤”是不能达到根治淮河的目的的。因为它还不能解决内涝问题。我们治水不应该单纯着眼于保堤而应重视保收。堤虽然能够保证不破，如果内涝不得到一定程度的解决，则仍可使农业受到严重损失，这就没有达到“保收”的基本目的。对于这种只重视防洪忽视除涝的思想，经过几年来的思想斗争和现实的教训，已经基本扭转过来，但是又可能产生另一种偏向，即重视除涝，而忽视关键性的防洪工程。譬如淮委提出的大型控制工程，对于承受河南来的大量客水，是非常必需的，但阜阳某些干部就不同意这种措施，他们认为淹地太多了，不合算。其实不牺牲小块就不能保证大块，这是很明显的道理，所以必须把防洪和除涝的工作很好结合起来，才能进一步扩大保收的面积。
    其次，便是防治水灾和旱灾的问题。兴修水利的目的，既是防治水、旱灾害，按理说，治水的人应该对防治这两种灾害都很重视了。但在实际工作中，人们又是对水灾看得重，对旱灾看得轻的。其中的道理，可能有两个，一是水灾来势凶猛，城镇可变丘墟，因而使人害怕。中国自古就说：“洪水胜于猛兽”。至于旱灾虽然年年皆有，但在一般情况下总是会有一定收成的，淮北群众说：“旱死也怕淹”“旱了也能有饭吃”。另外是大旱年景的确也比大水年为少。所以群众产生一种怕水不怕旱的思想。但是，从全省的角度来看，只要稍为算一笔账，就会发现因旱灾减收的粮食，并不比因水灾减收的粮食少多少。
    根据历史记载，两千年来，沿淮即有大小灾害九百八十多次，其中旱灾约占一半，并不少于水灾。以蚌埠及淮北1947年以前三十四年查勘的不完全资料统计，即有春旱十三次，夏旱七次，秋旱十次，冬旱十七次，三十四年内合计即有四十七次季节性的旱灾。淮北的主要农产品是小麦、黄豆，恰恰在这两种作物下种时，经常因为干旱不能及时下种，这种损失有多大呢？据老农反映，麦子晚种十天，就要减产一成；晚种一月，就要减产五成；黄豆迟种二十天，就要减产四成到五成。1953年全省大旱，一年就减收了二十一亿斤粮食。解放以来，每年全省因旱灾减收的粮食平均达到七亿五千万
  斤。这还只是就减产三成以上的庄稼统计的。如果将一般旱情，每亩减产十数斤计算在内，全省总起来就要减产十几亿斤，比一个局部地区遭了水灾，对国家减收的粮食还可能大一些，而这并不为人们所注意。目前旱粮作物的产量是很低的，旱粮作物的面积也是很大的（旱作物比水作物多两倍）。如果要完成农业发展纲要所提出的指标，首先要把旱粮作物提高到几百斤，要把许多可以改种水稻的地区改种水稻才有可能，否则，这个要求是困难的。因而今后大力克服轻视防旱的思想，就显得特别重要了。
    第三，防灾和综合利用的问题。综合利用是除害兴利的必要措施，这是完全必要的。但是综合利用中也有先后主次的问题。拿安徽的具体情况说，和群众关系最密切，群众最迫切需要的，应该是先办使农业能够
  “保收”“增产”的灌溉工程。但是，过去没有对这个实际情况进行认真的研究，有些人研究了，也没有重视群众这个最基本的要求，缺乏果断精神，常为似是而非的道理所动摇。如有的人强调，除害第一，兴利次之，结果放松了应有的兴利工程。有的人过分强调全面综合利用，把防灾、灌溉和发电、航运等同等看待，结果冲淡了最迫切需要的灌溉工程，如许多小河上的拦水闸，是花钱少收效大的工程，但几年来兴建极少。有时最便宜的兴利工程在计划中已经打算了，但在施工中又发生动摇，或者做得太小发生返工浪费。总之，我们对防灾与综合利用问题掌握不稳，这就使某些本来应该放在后面进行的工程提早进行了，或者只做了主要工程没有做辅助工程，因而对综合利用发挥不够，对农业的保收增产帮助不大。这种情况，使我们深深感到，在兴修水利的工作中，应该根据当地当时的情况，把主要目的弄清楚，分清主次后有步骤的来进行。
    总之，兴修水利，要把“防洪保堤”、“除涝保收”、“灌溉增产”的三个目的结合起来，统筹兼顾地考虑问题，不能顾此失彼。
    应该依靠谁？
    曾希圣同志认为，对自然作斗争其规模更大于对敌人作斗争，所以依靠谁的问题必须明确。他说，兴修水利的工作应该依靠群众，这是谁都能回答的。但是，从安徽省的情况看来，直到现在，有不少人在实际工作中对这一点还是模糊的。
    他说，一切工作中要依靠群众，要依靠政治教育来发动群众，要以自力更生的精神来克服困难，这是党一贯教育我们的基本原则。但是我们在实际工作中常常违背这些原则。特别在水利工作方面表现得最突出。他举了安徽几年来的水利工作会议和水利工作实践中的许多具体材料来说明这个问题。他说，从这些会议中和几年水利工作实践中可以看出，有不少同志存在以下几种不正确的思想：
    第一是不依靠群众力量和智慧，只依靠国家的钱来解决问题。他们在会议中不是如何介绍发动群众与灾害作斗争的经验，唯一的要求是伸手向国家要钱，有时为了几十万或几百万块钱的问题争得面红耳赤。他们不相信群众力量，也不懂得国家正在建设重工业，应该为国家节省钱。关于这一问题，我们今年进行了一定的批判，所以比之往年好多了。譬如今冬明春开始预算是四亿多土方，后来增加到八、九亿土方，这个数字等于合作化高潮那一年的二倍，等于1957年的三倍，等于原定计算的一倍以上，但他们并未向省里要求增加经费。如果都要国家投资，就以每方三角钱计算，即需要二亿四千万到二亿七千万元，如果以增加的土方计算，也需一亿二千多万元，这是一个多大的数目啊！国家那里有这么多的钱呢！
    事实上，依靠群众的力量，不依靠国家的钱，有很多地方的水利工程也进行得很好。1956年春全淮北打井十二万多眼，都是群众集资兑料，烧砖自办的。亳县1956年春根据“有力出力，评工记分，有钱出钱，记账付息，分期偿还”的两利政策，开展“千万砖，百万元”的投资运动，在全县用自力解决了经费和材料不足的困难，完成各种水井二万六千眼，以一眼浇十三亩计，约可灌溉三十九万亩左右。颍上县今春圈圩几十个，大多数都是群众自办，没有要政府出钱帮助。许多农业社，如巢县复兴乡、肥东先锋社，都依靠自己的力量，不要国家投资就解决了普通的水旱灾害。不仅小型农田水利工程可以这样做，就是大型工程也是可以吸取民力支援的。如合肥东埠水库的未了工程二十万土方，原来一定要求省里补充经费，后来提出依靠群众的口号之后，这个要求就自动打消了。
    第二是不依靠政治教育工作而依靠强迫命令和依靠工资来解决问题。这种现象在治淮初期是不存在的，那时政治教育工作做得比较认真，民工都是自愿报名上堤，工价虽低，但工程任务反完成得比较快。后来政治教育工作放松了，群众对水利工作的重要意义和艰苦性认识不足，特别是干部中的官僚主义和资本主义思想滋长了，因而首先发生了民工逃避和干部在动员民工上堤时的一些强迫命令主义现象，同时也由于受了某些地区民工工资过高的影响，因而更加放松了政治教育工作，产生了仰赖于提高工资办法来解决问题的偏向。例如最初治淮民工工资是三斤原粮一天，后来逐渐增加到八角五分，比原来提高到三倍左右。是否一定需要这样的工资标准呢？如果政治工作做得好，是可以减低的。今年我们就减成六角钱一天的工资，由于以农业发展纲要为中心进行了教育，不仅对减少二角五分的规定毫无意见，而且群众还自动的决定在六角钱一天的工资基础上多做70％左右的工程。但以前采取依靠工资解决问题的情况是怎样的呢？举一个例子来说明吧：新淝河上建了一座桥，建桥是为当地群众方便，本来可以由群众自建，但是淮委出钱把它建成了。建成后桥的两岸比桥面低一截，只需要垫些土就可畅行无阻，但因为是淮委投资所建，群众宁愿几个人把车子从桥的一头抬上桥面，到了另一头抬下来，也不肯自己抬土把两头低地垫起来，当地干部也不管。蚌埠专区的负责人经过这座桥，看到这种奇怪的现象，问群众为什么不垫土时，他们说，这是淮委的工程，垫可以，但要钱才行！由此可见，单依靠钱办事，不仅不能把事办好，而且会养成干部的依赖思想和助长群众的资本主义思想。这是值得引起注意的。
    第三是不依靠自己只依靠人家。这种现象在县区乡都表现很严重。位在上游的县区乡总是想把本地的洪水排泄到下游的县区乡，自己不愿蓄水，他们怕牺牲土地。但是在天旱的时候，位在下游的县区乡又总是与上游的县区乡争水，怪人家没有给水灌溉。因为不是自力更生的去战胜困难，所以水利纠纷经常发生，特别在抗旱和汛期到来时，纠纷尤为紧张。这两年来我们批判了这种损人利己思想，提出了消灭水灾要像消灭敌人伞兵一样，落在那里就把它消灭在那里，省、县、区、乡、社都要防洪，同样也都要自己备水防旱，因而纠纷比前少一些了。
    上面说过，依靠群众，依靠政治教育工作，依靠自力更生是党的基本原则，但由于我们干部存在着本位主义、资本主义思想，所以在实际工作中常常与这些原则相反。我认为在整风中也应把水利工作当成重点检查之一，这对发展今后水利工作是有很大帮助的。
    兴修水利的方法问题
    曾希圣同志说，“花钱少，收效快，收效大”，是兴修水利的总要求。就这个要求来探讨以往的治水方法有以下几个问题值得一谈。
    第一个是大、中、小工程究竟以那个为主，那个为副的问题。大、中、小工程在水利上是相互支持的，有了小型工程，没有大型工程，小型工程在特大洪水年成或大旱年成均得不到支持和保障。只有大中型工程，没有大量的小型工程，则大型工程是孤立的，便只有起防洪作用，不能起灌溉的作用。所以关键性的大型工程绝不能少，但中央提出的以小型为主的方针是完全正确的。只要把这些工程作一比较，便可了然。
    大型工程，如大水库、大控制，它的好处是有控制能力，而且能控制很大面积，防洪作用大。但缺点则是花钱多，收效不快。大水库要相当时间才能做成，工程作好了蓄了水，但也不能经常显现它的作用。因为在一般年成情况下则无蓄洪要求，在旱年情况下又因为缺乏中小工程，不能把水送到田里去。如梅山水库，在完工的几年中除有一年起了蓄洪作用外，其余年份则看不到其他作用，本来这个水库要灌溉成百万亩的农田，但因为庞大的引水渠道还没有进行，所以水库修成了好几年仍然不能对农田发挥其预定灌溉效果。中型工程也同样，如在河道上建闸，如果没有小型工程的配合，也是无能为力的。可是小型的农田水利工程则与此不同，一口塘、一口井在通常年成均能起作用，当年所做的土方，当年即能起作用。
    这是一方面，另一方面由于小型农田水利工程就是群众性的工程，这种工程靠近村庄，兴修方便，广大群众的力量均可使用得上，我们今年已有一千多万民工兴修，就是由于做的小型农田水利，否则是不可能使用如此大量民工的。同时小型工程（如沟洫塘井）用水也极方便，它既可积蓄雨水，又可吸取地下水。再一方面可以为国家大量节省资金。以安徽解放以来所做的中小型工程为例，小型工程共做十一亿五千万土方，中型工程基本建设做三千二百多万方，但是，小型工程的代价（国家补助和投资）每方不到一分钱，而中型工程则每方合到五角钱，相差近五十倍！（大型工程工价更高）而得到灌溉的田亩则是，因小型工程受到灌溉的为一千五百八十七万亩，因中型工程受到灌溉的只有九十七万多亩。由此可见，只有以小型工程为主才符合收效大、收效快和花钱少的要求。但是，现在有的人又偏向另外一面，即认为大型工程都可不要了，这当然也是不对的。
    第二是蓄水和泄水的问题。中央早就提出了蓄泄兼筹而又以蓄为主的方针，这一方针是正确的。但是，在兴修水利工作中，往往偏重于泄水而忽视蓄水；要不就是兴建大的蓄水工程，对于采取小型工程蓄水，很少人重视。为什么他们怕蓄水呢？这是由于受了水灾没有弄清为什么会有水灾的原故。实际上淮河以北地区之所以经常闹水灾，不是水多而是大水年成的水没有积蓄下来，改种水性作物的缘故。假如淮北能够把多余的水积蓄起来把大量旱地改为水田，把淮北变成水网地区，那末所谓十年二十年一遇的涝灾就可消除了。产量也可大量提高。所以忽视蓄水的情况应该迅速地、切实地加以改变。
    但究竟要怎样蓄水呢？有人主张在点线蓄水，搞大型工程。关键性的大蓄水工程当然是需要的，不可少的。不过单纯兴建这种工程，还是不能解决广大面上的水旱灾害的。事实证明，淮河大水库和洼地蓄洪的大工程已修的不少，它们也确有防洪蓄水作用，可以保证在1954年型的洪水不致溃决。但是它们不能解决淮北地区仍是年年不涝即旱的情况，不能很好地保证农业收成。这是因为大的洼地蓄洪工程只能解决外水侵袭，不能解决内水出路。
    要想把广大面积的水灾治好，并消除经常不断的旱灾，就必须采取以治面为主和点、线相结合的治理方针，就必须采取除点、线蓄水外，还要在广大面积上蓄水的办法。治淮工程的负责人，曾经初步计算过淮北的蓄水潜力。淮北四千五百万亩耕地，共可蓄六十五亿方水。打井的蓄水量，还没有计算进去。这当然是一个谨慎偏低的计算，实际还不止此数。但是，就拿这个蓄水作用来说，它的蓄水量就要比佛子岭水库的蓄水量大十几倍了（佛子岭水库蓄五亿方左右）。这就说明，蓄水应以面为主，只有在广大面上安排了水，才能有效防止灾害。所以，我们应当依靠广大群众兴修小型工程。
    曾希圣同志指出，这些小型工程的蓄水，不但量大、省钱，而且是防治洪、涝、旱灾最有效的办法，是把除害兴利结合起来，把本地水利用于本地的办法。除此以外，还有许多其他好处，如对气候的调节，环境的改变等，则更不是几个大工程所能奏效的。他谈到这里又反过来说到点面结合蓄水的重要。他说，广大面的蓄水工程虽有数不尽的好处，但仍有一个严重的弱点。在雨水少的年份，便需要点、线蓄水来辅助，在雨量大的年份，又需要点、线帮助它排水和蓄水；面的蓄水固可减轻点、线工程的负担，但是如果忽视了点、线工程，在特大洪水有破堤危险时，面的蓄水工程也会受到破坏。所以，以面蓄为主，结合点、线蓄水，是一个比较稳妥，比较全面的方法。
    曾希圣同志还说到治干流和治支流的关系问题。他说，把干流治好是很必要的，但是干流的水是由许多支流汇集而来的，如果只重视治干流而忽视支流的治理，就不能把水治好。治淮最初即曾出过这种毛病。
    曾希圣同志根据安徽的经验还向记者谈了一些兴修小型水利工程的具体方法。在兴修水利中，应该做些什么小型水利工程？怎样做最好呢？他说，各种不同的地区都有适应当地需要的小型工程。如在山区和丘陵区，一般是修山谷水库、谷坊、塘、坝、梯田及其他水土保持工程，以蓄水拦沙；在平原是打井、挑塘，作沟洫、畦田，以蓄水防旱；在洼地是圈圩改种，作台田以抵御外水；在圩区则是兴建提水工程，以加强排灌。谈到这里，他又把做小工程的几点体会，作了如下介绍。
    在平原地区挖沟方面，他说，沟有大、中、小三种，一般说都是需要的，但是应以中沟为主，要挖深沟。因为小沟是农田里引水的，没有排蓄作用，是季节性的临时工程，属于耕作范围之内，大沟虽能排水也能蓄水，但由于沟面过宽，费工也较大。中沟呢，它的作用比大沟大。第一，因为两三条中沟可以代替一条大沟，但一条大沟不能代替两三条中沟。中沟联系的耕地面积广，吸取地下水的面积也大，排水、灌溉都比大沟方便。沟旁种起树来，既能改变气候，又能积蓄肥料。第二，中沟的沟面宽度没有大沟大，运土距离近，容易开挖，同样的排蓄面积，比大沟费工少。第三，挖中沟便利于群众，因为不需离家太远，早晚均能做工。
    在挖塘方面：他说，中国的旧式塘是方塘和圆塘。这种塘除地形条件形成的以外，是不应该采用的。理由仍是运距大，费的劳力多，而且它联系耕地面积不大，吸取地下水量不多。现在很多地方把方塘、圆塘改成长形的塘，就好得多。长塘像是沟的一段，运距小，节省劳力，而它最大的好处是在地下地上联系的面积均比方塘、圆塘要大。另外，在地下水丰富的地区，塘中下泉或沟中下泉，都被证明是利用地下水的一个很好的办法，都是值得提倡的。
    在洼地圈圩改种水稻方面，他说，这个办法原来是赞成者少，经过多番说服，和到水网地区调查之后才被水利部门所接受。现在已在淮北做出了一些成绩，证明凡是有外水侵犯、内水无处安排的地方均是可用的。
    在圩区建立排灌工程方面，在山区提倡作梯田方面，曾希圣同志都谈了他的体会。
    曾希圣同志最后说，以上是根据安徽几年的水利工作所得出的一点体会，缺乏周密研究，错误一定很多。他还说，如果要争取在水利工作方面少走弯路，一个重要办法是研究我国几千年的治水经验。他说，我国治水经验是很丰富的，长江沿岸的圩田，就是其中重要的一项。按每年长江沿岸的雨水量来说，它比淮北大得多，但是那里因为圩田工程作得好，不但遭灾少，而且收成高。可见研究我国水利经验是极为重要的。
