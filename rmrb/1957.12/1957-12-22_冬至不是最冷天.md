Winter Solstice Isn't the Coldest Day
Zhong Kan

Today (the 22nd) is the "Winter Solstice." In the Northern Hemisphere, today is the day with the shortest daylight and the longest night of the year. In Beijing, the day will only be nine hours and twenty minutes long, while the night will be fourteen hours and forty minutes. After today, the days will gradually get longer.

On the "Winter Solstice," the sun shines directly on the Southern Hemisphere at 23.5 degrees south latitude. The Northern Hemisphere is farthest from the sun, and the area illuminated by sunlight is the smallest. At the same time, sunlight strikes the ground at an oblique angle, passing through a very thick atmospheric (air) layer.

Although the "Winter Solstice" has the shortest daylight hours and the ground absorbs the least amount of solar heat, it is not the coldest day; the coldest days are more than a month after the Winter Solstice. According to historical meteorological data from Beijing, the coldest days usually occur in mid-to-late January.

Chinese folklore has it that from the second day after the "Winter Solstice," each nine days is considered one "nine," and after three "nines" (twenty-seven days), reaching four "nines" (thirty-six days), it's called the "Three Nines" and "Four Nines" weather, which is the coldest time. Therefore, people often say: "Three Nines, Four Nines, freezing the tea and wine." Why is it said that the "Winter Solstice" is not cold, and the cold is in the "Three Nines" and "Four Nines"?

Generally, the coldest time is not when the ground absorbs the least amount of heat, but when it releases the most heat. Before the "Winter Solstice," after the summer and autumn seasons, the ground has accumulated a lot of heat. Entering winter, although some heat is lost at night, some compensation can still be obtained from the accumulated heat, so the weather is not yet at its coldest. After the Winter Solstice, the heat loss from the ground has reached its extreme. Although the sun gradually moves north, the heat absorbed by the ground during the day cannot offset the heat lost during the long nights. Because expenditure exceeds income, the temperature drops day by day. The "Three Nines" and "Four Nines" weather is like this. At this time, strong cold waves (cold air) often invade our country from Siberia and the Mongolian People's Republic, accompanied by wind and snow, freezing the ground, so the weather is the coldest.

Since the beginning of winter this year, nationwide, the temperatures in November have been higher than the average temperature in previous years (except for individual regions). And there is such a trend in early December. This is because the atmospheric circulation, the Earth's rotational movement of air, is relatively straight, and the path of cold air flowing in Asia is also relatively north and east. Therefore, so far, our country has only been invaded by small amounts of cold air, and has not been hit by strong cold waves. In Beijing, in the first and middle ten days of December, the daily average temperature was above zero Celsius for many days, and the lowest temperature only reached minus eleven degrees Celsius (on the 18th). Relatively speaking, this winter is much warmer than last year, with a winter warmth phenomenon.

People may speculate, after a warm winter, will there be a cold spring next year? From the perspective of climate development, warm winters and cold springs have their historical regularity. For example, the warm winter of 1951 in Beijing was followed by the cold spring of 1952; the warm winter of 1953 was followed by the cold spring of 1954; the warm winter of 1955 was followed by the cold spring of 1956; this year's warm winter may be followed by a cold spring next year. Therefore, the cold days are only a beginning now. Chinese farmers' proverb says: "From the first nine to the second nine, don't shake hands when you meet; the third nine, twenty-seven, candy hangs on half the wall; the fourth nine, thirty-six, just frozen thoroughly; the fifth nine, forty-five, poor man dances in the street, don't dance, there are still forty-five days of spring cold." This tells us to be prepared for the spring cold, pay attention to the cold and warmth in life, and at the same time do all the preparations for frost prevention for agricultural production, and strive for a great harvest in agriculture next year.

On the Winter Solstice, because the sun is extremely south, the shadows of objects reflected on the ground are particularly long. According to old customs, on this day, women should present shoes and socks to their parents-in-law, taking the meaning of welcoming blessings and stepping on longevity for more blessings and longevity. Cui Yin has a "Sock Inscription", and Cao Zhi has a "Winter Solstice Presentation of Socks Memorial", which shows that this custom existed very early. When presenting shoes and socks, some auspicious blessings should also be attached. For example: "Pray for eternal years, eliminate misfortune," "Step on the beginning and tread on the long sun from below," "Advantageous to see adults towards this eternal year," etc.

Regarding the food for the Winter Solstice, customs vary greatly from place to place. There is such a superstitious legend: In ancient times, there was a Gonggong clan, who had an unsuccessful son, who happened to die on the Winter Solstice, and after his death, he turned into a plague ghost. But this plague ghost is most afraid of red adzuki beans. Therefore, on this day, if you cook and eat red adzuki bean porridge, you can avoid plague ghosts and not get sick. Some families eat wontons on the Winter Solstice. There is such a ballad: "The new festival has passed, the soles of the leather shoes are broken, knead big wontons, one bite at a time." Some families make pickled vegetables from frost-covered Xue Li Hong (mustard greens) and radish greens on the Winter Solstice, as a winter reserve. Another saying is that eating radishes on the Winter Solstice can avoid throat diseases.

Although the origins of these customs are sometimes based on superstitious legends, most of them are experiences accumulated by the masses in production and life. For example, selecting seeds in winter, storing vegetables, and often eating radishes are all beneficial to production and good for people's lives and health. However, due to the development of science, we know that these things do not necessarily have to be done on the Winter Solstice. (Attached picture)

    冬至不是最冷天
    钟侃
    今天（22日）是“冬至”日。在北半球各地，今天是一年当中白天最短、夜里最长的一天。北京这一天，白天只有九小时二十分，夜里却有十四小时四十分。今天以后，白天就逐渐长起来了。
    “冬至”日，太阳直射到南半球的南纬二十三度半上，北半球离太阳最远，被太阳光照射到的面积最小，同时太阳光是斜射到地面上的，穿过大气（空气）层的厚度又很大。
    “冬至”日虽然白天最短，地面吸收太阳光的热量最少，却不是最冷的日子；最冷的日子是在冬至过后一个多月。从北京历史气象资料来看，最冷的日子，常在一月中下旬。
    我国民间相传，从“冬至”第二日起为一九，过了三九二十七天，到四九三十六天的时候，便叫“三九”、“四九”天气，也就是最冷的时候。所以人们常说：“三九四九，冻破茶酒”。为什么说“冬至”不冷，冷在“三九”、“四九”呢？
    一般情况，最冷的时候，不是地面吸收热量最少的时候，而是在放热最多的时候。“冬至”以前，经过了夏秋两季，地面积蓄的热量较多；进入冬季，虽然在夜里要散失一些热量，但还可以从积热里取得一部分补偿，所以天气还不到最冷的时候。冬至以后，地面热力的亏耗已经达到了极点，虽然太阳光渐向北移，但地面白天吸收的热量，抵消不了漫长的夜里所散失的热量，因为入不敷出，温度只有一天一天的往下降。“三九”、“四九”天气，就是这般光景。这时候，还常有强大寒潮（冷空气）从西伯利亚和蒙古人民共和国入侵我国，风雪伴随而来，天寒地冻，所以天气最冷。
    今年入冬以来，在全国来说，11月份的气温都比历年平均温度高（个别地区除外）。而12月上旬也有这样的趋势。这是因为大气环流空气围绕地球的旋转运动比较平直，冷空气在亚洲流动的路径也是比较偏北偏东。所以我国到现在为止，只有小股冷空气的侵入，还没有受到强大寒潮的袭击。北京12月份上中旬，每日平均温度，有许多天是在摄氏零上的，最低温度也只到过摄氏零下十一度（18日）。相对的来说，今年冬天比去年要暖和多了，有冬暖的现象。
    人们也许会推测，冬暖之后，明年是不是会有春寒？从气候的发展情况看，冬暖春寒，是有它的历史规律性的。比如北京1951年的冬暖，便有1952年的春寒；1953年的冬暖，便有1954年的春寒；1955年冬暖，1956年也春寒；今年的冬暖，可能出现明年的春寒。因此寒冷的日子，现在只是一个开端。我国农谚说：“一九至二九，相逢不握手；三九二十七，锭糖挂半壁；四九三十六，方才冻得熟；五九四十五，穷汉街头舞，不要舞，还有春寒四十五。”这就告诉了我们要戒备春寒，注意生活上的冷暖，同时要为农业生产做好一切防冻防霜的准备工作，争取明年农业的大丰收。
    冬至日因为太阳极南，映在地面上的物体的影子特别长，旧俗这天妇女要向公婆进献履袜，取其迎福践长多福多寿的意思。崔駰有“袜铭”，曹植有“冬至献袜表”，可见这个风气很早就有。在献履袜的时候，还要附上一些吉利的祝词。例如：“祈永年，除凶殃”，“履端践长阳从下迁”，“利见大人向兹永年”等。
    关于冬至日的食物，各地习俗很不一致。有这样一个迷信的传说：古时候有个共工氏，他有个不成才的儿子，恰巧在冬至这天死了，死后就变为疫鬼。但是这疫鬼最怕赤小豆。所以这天，如果煮赤小豆粥吃，就可以避除疫鬼，不生疾病。还有的人家在冬至这天吃馄饨。有这样的一个歌谣：“新节已故，皮鞋底破，大捏馄饨，一口一个。”有的人家在冬至这天用经霜的雪里红、萝卜缨作成咸菜，当作一冬的储备。又一说在冬至日吃萝卜可免去嗓子病。
    这些习俗的来源，虽则有的出于迷信传说，但其中绝大部分都是群众在生产和生活中积累下来的经验。例如冬季选种、储菜和常吃些萝卜等，也都是对生产有利，对人们的生活与健康有好处的。不过由于科学的发展，我们知道这些事情不一定都要在冬至这一天来作罢了。（附图片）
