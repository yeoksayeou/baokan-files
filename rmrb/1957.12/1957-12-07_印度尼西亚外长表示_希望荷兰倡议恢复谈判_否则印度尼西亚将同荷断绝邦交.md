　　Indonesian Foreign Minister States
　  Hope for Dutch Initiative to Resume Negotiations
    Otherwise Indonesia Will Sever Diplomatic Relations with the Netherlands
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th - Paris Dispatch: Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio said at a press conference in Paris on the 5th that if the Dutch government does not adopt a new attitude and action to resolve the West Irian issue, the Indonesian government will sever diplomatic relations with the Netherlands.
    Subandrio pointed out that the "new attitude" which he said should be adopted by the Dutch government is that the Dutch side should initiate the resumption of negotiations to discuss the status of West Irian and other issues between the two countries.
    At the press conference, Subandrio also stated that Indonesia hopes to normalize relations with the Netherlands. In explaining "normalization of relations," Subandrio said, "We need friendly and normal relations, without the current interference."
    In response to a reporter's question as to whether the Indonesian government intends to nationalize all Dutch enterprises in the country, Subandrio said that our government hopes to resolve relations with the Netherlands peacefully. We are waiting for the Netherlands to take the initiative and are always willing to negotiate. However, during this period, the situation is deteriorating, and we may have to take certain measures.
    According to reports from The Hague, Dutch sources, commenting on Subandrio's remarks, stated that the Dutch government will not consider initiating negotiations with the Indonesian government. They said that any such initiative must come from Indonesia.
    Subandrio arrived in Paris on the 4th after attending the recent United Nations General Assembly debate on the West Irian issue in New York. In Paris, he had discussions with the Indonesian diplomatic envoy to The Hague, Maramis, on the issue of relations between the Netherlands and Indonesia.

　　印度尼西亚外长表示
　  希望荷兰倡议恢复谈判
    否则印度尼西亚将同荷断绝邦交
    新华社6日讯　巴黎消息：印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约5日在巴黎举行的记者招待会上说，如果荷兰政府不采取新的态度和行动来解决西伊里安问题，印度尼西亚政府就将同荷兰断绝外交关系。
    苏班德里约指出，他所说的应该由荷兰政府采取的“新的态度”，就是由荷兰方面倡议恢复谈判来讨论西伊里安的地位问题以及两国之间的其他问题。
    苏班德里约在记者招待会上还表示，印度尼西亚希望同荷兰的关系正常化。在解释“关系正常化”时，苏班德里约说，“我们需要友好正常的关系，没有现在这样的干涉。”
    在回答记者提出的关于印度尼西亚政府是否要把国内所有的荷兰企业收归国有的问题时，苏班德里约说，我国政府希望能够和平地解决同荷兰的关系问题。我们正在等待荷兰采取主动，并且始终愿意谈判。但是在这个期间，局势正在恶化，我们可能不得不采取某些措施。
    据海牙消息，荷兰方面人士在评论苏班德里约的这次谈话时表示，荷兰政府将不考虑倡议同印度尼西亚政府进行谈判。他们说，任何这种倡议必须来自印度尼西亚。
    苏班德里约是在纽约参加了最近联合国大会关于西伊里安问题的讨论以后，在4日到达巴黎的。他在巴黎曾经同印度尼西亚驻海牙的外交使节马拉米斯就荷兰和印度尼西亚的关系问题进行了商谈。
