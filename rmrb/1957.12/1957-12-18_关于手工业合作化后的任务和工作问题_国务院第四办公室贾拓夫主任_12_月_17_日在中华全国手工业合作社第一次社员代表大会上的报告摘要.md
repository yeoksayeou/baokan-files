The convocation of this National Handicraft Cooperative Member Representative Congress is of great historical significance. Such a congress is the first of its kind in the history of China's handicraft industry. This is a socialist victory congress where China's handicraft industry has shifted from individual economy to collective economy, and also a congress for China's handicraft workers to continue advancing on the basis of this victory. Through this congress, handicraft cooperatives will be further consolidated and improved, the task of socialist transformation of the handicraft industry will continue to be completed, a high degree of enthusiasm for socialist construction will be fully developed, and a new and increasingly magnificent production upsurge will be launched to welcome the great Second Five-Year Plan that is about to unfold. On behalf of the State Council, I extend warm congratulations to the congress and wish it success.

The Basic Tasks for the Next Three to Five Years

China is a country with relatively backward modern industry, but a very developed handicraft industry. Handicraft production has a long history and a broad mass base. There are approximately 20 million handicraft producers nationwide, of which about 8 million are professional craftsmen. Not only is the industry in many medium and small cities and towns almost entirely handicraft-based, but also in large cities there is a considerable amount of handicraft production. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the total output value of handicraft production is estimated to account for about 18% of the total industrial output value of the country. There are many handicraft industries and a wide variety of products; there are both manufacturing and repair service industries, both means of production and means of livelihood, and arts and crafts. Handicraft production and management are also very flexible, including both fixed workshops for batch production, zero-work processing, refurbishment, and door-to-door service; handicrafts can make full use of scattered, small amounts of resources, as well as industrial scraps and waste materials. At the same time, handicrafts can rely on their own accumulation to expand part of the reproduction to meet social needs and reduce state investment in this area; they can also absorb a part of the surplus labor force and expand social employment. Therefore, handicrafts play an important and indispensable role in adapting to the dispersed, complex, and ever-changing social needs, supporting agricultural production, supporting national construction, supplying export needs, and accumulating funds for the state.

However, we should also see that handicraft production in the individual economy generally has the aspects of being scattered, backward, blind, and conservative, and in production there are also weaknesses such as high material consumption, low output rate, high cost, and poor working conditions. These shortcomings are gradually being improved after socialist transformation, although they are still difficult to completely eliminate in the early stages of transformation. Some of our comrades see more of the shortcomings of handicrafts, but do not have sufficient understanding of its advantages, its position and role in the national economy. Therefore, they lack due attention to handicrafts, thinking that there is no future; or blindly mechanizing handicraft production and transforming handicraft cooperatives into state-owned factories prematurely. These are all wrong.

The main focus of socialist industrialization should be modern industry. Without modern industry, socialist industrialization is impossible. However, this does not mean that socialist industry is all modern industry and does not require any handicrafts. Socialist industry should not only be dominated by large-scale industry, but also have the cooperation of medium and small-scale industries, and also have handicrafts as an assistant to modern industry to supplement the shortcomings of modern industry. As everyone knows, China has a large area, a large population, and very uneven industrial development. In terms of the long-term development prospects of socialist construction, some handicrafts will be replaced by modern industry; some handicrafts will gradually develop into modern industry. Both are important symbols of the transformation of China's national economy towards modernization, which is obviously beneficial to the socialist cause and is necessary. However, there must also be a large part of handicrafts that will not need to be replaced by modern industry and will not need to develop into modern industry for a considerable period of time. This part of handicrafts will coexist with modern industry for a long time. Therefore, while developing modern industry, we should also utilize and appropriately develop the potential of handicraft production.

The Party and the government have always paid great attention and care to the handicraft industry. While actively supporting handicraft production and giving full play to its role in the national economy, we have also actively and step-by-step guided the scattered and backward individual handicraft industry to gradually develop in the direction of collectivization. Our Party and government have always believed that only through the road of collectivization can the productive forces of the handicraft industry be liberated, so that the vast number of handicraft workers can forever get rid of the road of poverty and hardship of capitalism, in order to better play the active role of the handicraft industry and accelerate socialist construction.

After cooperativization, China's handicraft industry has shown great superiority, proving that cooperatives are far better than individual work.

Now, China's First Five-Year Plan has been successfully completed and overfulfilled, and the handicraft industry's First Five-Year Plan has also been overfulfilled. The Second Five-Year Plan, which is even larger in scale, is about to begin. The Party and the state require that in the next ten years, we strive to achieve the goals stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program's Forty Articles, and after fifteen years, strive to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in terms of the output of steel and other important industrial products, and to build China into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. By that time, the Soviet Union's industry and agriculture will catch up with or surpass the United States in terms of the output of the most important products. In this way, socialist countries can leave the imperialist countries far behind. This is a very glorious, great, and arduous task. Since the national handicraft workers are an important productive force in the national economy, they must share a part of the due responsibility under this glorious, great, and arduous task, and give full play to the active role of the handicraft industry in the great construction. I believe that all handicraft workers, together with the people of the whole country, can overcome all possible difficulties and complete their due tasks. Our ideals will definitely be realized. However, we should also see that China is originally a country with a large population, little land, a poor foundation, and a relatively low level of industrial and agricultural production. The country's accumulation and construction materials are not abundant, and the scientific, cultural, and technical forces are also relatively weak. Therefore, to gradually realize such a great task, we must adhere to the policy of increasing production and practicing economy, building the country diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, managing households diligently and thriftily, and doing everything diligently and thriftily, tapping potential from all aspects, and carrying out socialist construction in accordance with the Party Central Committee's policy of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

In the next three to five years, we should basically achieve further consolidation and improvement of the existing handicraft cooperatives politically, ideologically, organizationally, and economically; on the basis of consolidating and improving handicraft cooperatives nationwide, we should strive to develop production. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the national handicraft cooperatives should strive to ensure that the annual growth rate of total output value is not lower than the average growth rate of total industrial and agricultural output value during the same period, in accordance with the needs of the country and the possibility of supply and marketing; and should cooperate with relevant departments to strengthen the leadership and transformation of supply and marketing production cooperatives, supply and marketing production groups, and individual handicraftsmen, and be able to basically overcome the spontaneous tendency of capitalism and continue to complete the task of socialist transformation. We require that every handicraft cooperative and each level of federation be able to formulate active and reliable overall plans in accordance with these far-reaching goals and their own specific conditions, and mobilize all handicraft workers to make a hundred times their efforts to ensure that all of them are realized.

In order to achieve these tasks, we must pay attention to and solve the following issues:

On the Rectification Campaign, Cooperative Rectification, and Socialist Education

Although the issue of who will win in terms of ownership in China's handicraft industry has been basically resolved, the issue of who will win in terms of the political and ideological fronts cannot be said to have been resolved. It should be seen that handicraftsmen are laborers, but also small private owners. Precisely because they are laborers, they can resolutely take the socialist road under the leadership of the working class. This is the good side, and also the basic side. But on the other hand, precisely because they are small private owners, they are easily influenced by capitalist ideas. This is why it is necessary to carry out socialist transformation of handicraftsmen. The members of China's handicraft cooperatives today are mostly small individual producers who were not long ago. The majority of them are handicraft workers and poor independent laborers, and they basically enthusiastically support the cooperative system. However, even among these people, without thorough socialist transformation, many people may be influenced by bourgeois ideology. Among the original small owners and some wealthier independent laborers, the capitalist tendency is even more serious. There are also a very small number of disgruntled bad elements and anti-socialist elements who carry out sabotage activities in the cooperatives, and even usurp the leadership of individual cooperatives, leading some cooperatives to the road of speculation and illegality. Therefore, carrying out a widespread rectification campaign in the handicraft cooperative system has become a very necessary and urgent political task, in order to carry out universal and in-depth ideological education of socialist transformation for the vast number of handicraft workers through the rectification campaign.

According to the spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report at the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party: The rectification campaign of the handicraft cooperatives must fully develop the enthusiasm of the handicraft workers and poor independent laborers to take the socialist road, pay attention to uniting the relatively wealthy and skilled members, expose and criticize the capitalist tendencies of the original small owners and some wealthy independent laborers, and stop the sabotage activities of bad elements. In this way, we can rely on the majority of the masses, establish the leadership advantage of the handicraft workers and poor independent laborers, and ensure the healthy development of the rectification campaign.

The rectification campaign of handicraft cooperatives must be combined with cooperative rectification. We must not only believe in the majority of the masses, let go and mobilize the masses, carry out great airing of views and debates, so that the masses can speak freely. On the basis of the great airing of views and debates, we must boldly change, resolutely change, and thoroughly change, rely on the masses, and severely rectify the work style, rectify the organization, improve the work, and improve the production. After the airing of views and debates are relatively thorough, and the problems that can be changed have been corrected, we must organize great debates and arguments on some major issues. Through methods such as presenting facts, reasoning, recalling the past, making comparisons, and calculating detailed accounts, we must enable the masses to clarify right and wrong, thereby improving the socialist awareness of the members and consolidating the handicraft cooperatives.

It is required that the rectification campaign of handicraft cooperatives nationwide can be universally launched in a planned and guided manner in the first half of 1958. In the rectification campaign of handicraft cooperatives, we must not only ensure that production and rectification are not delayed, but also that production and thinking are improved. With the widespread and in-depth rectification campaign, a new production upsurge will inevitably appear in the handicraft cooperatives. We must be prepared to welcome the arrival of this upsurge.

Of course, the ideological influence of small producers that exists among the vast number of members cannot be completely eliminated overnight or in one or two movements. On the basis of the rectification campaign, we must constantly strengthen socialist education for the members, and constantly persist in political and ideological work in the handicraft cooperative system.

On the Issue of Centralized Production and Decentralized Production

The experiences of various localities in adjusting and rectifying the production and organization of handicraft cooperatives over the past year have proved that after the cooperativization of the handicraft industry, the issue of centralized production and decentralized production must be appropriately resolved, otherwise it will be unfavorable to the development of production. To properly resolve this issue, we must determine the degree of concentration or dispersion of production and management based on the characteristics and specific conditions of each industry, starting from the principles of benefiting production, benefiting service to residents, and not affecting the income of members. With the changes and development of objective conditions, corresponding adjustments must also be made. Under normal circumstances, for some manufacturing industries' cooperatives, the product specifications are single and they are produced in batches, and the supply of raw materials and the sales of products are all through state-owned commercial and cooperative commercial sectors; or the production division of labor is more detailed, the technical requirements are higher, and the cooperative relationship is close. In certain production processes, it is possible and necessary to gradually adopt machine production. If the conditions such as factories and cadres are available, the problems such as eating and accommodation can be solved, and family auxiliary labor can be properly arranged, then with the consent of the members, production can be appropriately concentrated, and the method of unified supply and sales and unified calculation of profits and losses can be implemented. Of course, we must proceed with caution when doing so; at the same time, we must pay attention to the fact that the scale of centralized production cooperatives should not be too large. As for those multi-industry mixed cooperatives and large cooperatives that cover the entire county and the entire industry from beginning to end, they are all unreasonable. Some cooperatives (groups) that produce a variety of scattered products, and whose products directly meet consumers, as well as cooperatives (groups) that mainly process door-to-door work, are generally better small than large, and some can carry out production in units of groups; the groups can also purchase and sell on their own, and calculate profits and losses separately. Repair service handicraft cooperatives (groups) are generally suitable for decentralization, and can also take the method of each being responsible for profits and losses, household production, or mobile service. For family handicrafts that accept processing orders, it is suitable to establish handicraft cooperatives (groups) with decentralized production, unified supply and sales, and wages paid on a piece-rate basis.

After the upsurge of handicraft cooperativization, some handicraft cooperatives (groups) have already adjusted this issue inappropriately and have gained a lot of experience. Currently, some cooperatives (groups) that need to be adjusted on this issue have not yet been adjusted, and those that now need to be adjusted with the changes and development of objective conditions, should be adjusted in a timely manner.

On the Production Management of Handicraft Cooperatives

Handicraft cooperatives are collective economic organizations of the working masses, and their production management must be carried out in accordance with the principle of democratic centralism, in accordance with the provisions of the cooperative's charter, and implement the policies of running the cooperative democratically and thriftily. The system of members' congresses or members' representative congresses should be established and improved in order to better unite all members, give play to collective strength, strengthen production management, promote production development, improve product quality, increase varieties, and improve service quality.

Over the past few years, a lot of experience has been accumulated and many improvements have been made in the production management of handicraft cooperatives; but from the perspective of the requirements of development, it is still far from enough, and it is necessary to further summarize the experience in this area and promote it in order to improve the management level of handicraft cooperatives.

According to the experience of some advanced cooperatives, the production management of handicraft cooperatives has several main aspects, such as planned management, technical management, and financial management. However, it must be pointed out that handicraft cooperatives have their own characteristics, and all management methods of handicrafts must start from these characteristics. Although handicraft cooperatives can refer to a set of production management methods of modern factories, they must never mechanically apply them. Moreover, there are different characteristics among handicraft cooperatives, so management methods cannot be forced to be uniform.

From 1958, the handicraft plan will be included in the national and local industrial plans, therefore, it is even more necessary to strengthen planned management of handicraft production. However, the management methods for handicraft plans must be simple and easy to implement, and must have a certain degree of flexibility. There cannot be too many indicators, and the reports should be streamlined. For cooperatives that have fixed products and batch production, simple and effective operation plans can be gradually implemented according to different management levels; for cooperatives with scattered and complex products and repair services, there can only be monthly or quarterly reference plans, and within the month and quarter, the main method is to arrange production by means of regular or irregular dispatching of work, to adapt to the ever-changing needs of the market. In terms of labor organization, even for cooperatives with concentrated production and batch production, it is necessary to specifically determine different production situations. For products that are mass-produced and have simple varieties and specifications, a flow-line operation method can be adopted; for products that are produced in small quantities and have complex varieties and specifications, a group division of labor and individual work method should be adopted. According to the characteristics of handicraft products, it is generally not advisable to adopt a flow-line operation method. For cooperatives that have diverse and complex products, small-batch or individual production, especially those that produce unique products and brand-name products, as well as repair service cooperatives, the flow-line operation method cannot be adopted. It is possible to consider dividing groups or implementing individual work methods according to product type, with the main process as the center. Since some handicrafts still have the situation of supporting the off-season with the peak season, labor time should be flexibly controlled to adapt to the characteristics of the off-season and peak season and the needs of production and operation, and should not be rigidly stipulated. In terms of technical management, attention should be paid to gradually formulating relatively simple product quality standards and operational requirements, and establishing an easy-to-implement inspection system to ensure and improve product quality. It is particularly worth noting that financial management of handicraft cooperatives should be strengthened, which is currently a weak link in management. All handicraft cooperatives should be able to achieve daily clearing, monthly closing, consistent accounts, and regular publication of accounts, mobilize mass supervision, and prevent and overcome the phenomenon of corruption and waste.

Handicraft production must generally also implement the principles of using local materials, manufacturing locally, and selling locally. Some handicraft cooperatives whose raw materials come from other places and whose products are sold to other places should directly contact relevant departments in other places closely to maintain a reasonable direction of material flow. At the same time, the sales of handicraft products and the procurement of raw materials must also be subject to the country's market management and price management, and must not raise prices, suppress prices, or rush to purchase and resell raw materials.

On Correctly Handling the Relationship Between the State, Handicraft Cooperatives, and Members

In our socialist country, the state represents the common interests of the working people, and the working people are the masters of the country. The fundamental interests of the state, handicraft cooperatives, and members are completely consistent and inseparable.

From the relationship between the state and handicraft cooperatives, in addition to the Party and the state strengthening leadership and support for handicraft cooperatives politically, in the early stages of handicraft cooperativization, the state allocated more than 130 million yuan as funds and financial subsidies for handicraft cooperatives; in terms of taxation and bank credit, handicraft cooperatives also received a lot of care. Recently, the State Council has also decided that the raw materials required by handicraft cooperatives that are under the unified distribution and ministerial management of the state, except for coal, which requires prices to be determined according to use, are supplied at the allocation price, which is lower than the market price. State-owned commercial sectors and supply and marketing cooperatives have also provided many conveniences for handicraft cooperatives in terms of raw material supply and product promotion. This strong financial and material support is an important condition for the development of handicraft cooperative production. At the same time, the development of handicraft cooperative production has also created huge wealth for the country, supplied market needs, and increased state tax revenue. In the future, on the basis of continued production development, it will make more contributions to the country.

From the relationship between handicraft cooperatives and members: handicraft cooperatives and members are interdependent. On the one hand, members rely on the collective strength of the cooperatives to overcome the various difficulties of individual production and greatly improve labor productivity; when handicraft cooperatives are consolidated, the production and lives of members are guaranteed, and with the development of production, the material and cultural living standards of members can be gradually improved. On the other hand, the production development of handicraft cooperatives depends on the efforts of the vast number of members; and when the lives of members are improved, it will stimulate them to further develop their enthusiasm and creativity, thereby more powerfully promoting production.

Therefore, the handicraft cooperatives that have developed under the leadership and support of the Party and the state should exemplary abide by the country's policies and laws, assume their due obligations, and with the development of production, strive to bear greater obligations, and resolutely fight against all phenomena of speculation and damage to the interests of the country and consumers. Each member should love the country, love the cooperative, and take the cooperative as his home, and oppose embezzlement, theft, passive work, and other illegal acts that harm public interests for personal gain. Handicraft cooperatives should also regularly care about the sufferings of members and pay attention to gradually improving the lives of members.

Of course, this does not mean that there are no contradictions between the state, the collective, and the individual. There are contradictions, and the problem lies in how to correctly handle these contradictions.

The principle for correctly handling these contradictions should be that individual interests are subordinate to collective interests, local interests are subordinate to overall interests, and current interests are subordinate to long-term interests. Conversely, collective interests must also take into account individual interests, overall interests must also take into account local interests, and long-term interests must also take into account current interests.

Currently, the most prominent issue in the relationship between the state, handicraft cooperatives, and members is the issue of distribution between accumulation and consumption. Over the past few years, on the basis of developing production, the wage income of members has increased and their lives have improved. After the upsurge of handicraft cooperativization in 1956, the principle of "wages first, then medical treatment, then accumulation" was put forward in response to the situation where the income of some members of some cooperatives had declined at that time, so that the income of most members increased and the difficulties in medical treatment were solved. This was the correct thing to do. However, some cooperatives have one-sidedly understood this point, and the capitalist spontaneous tendency of small producers has also grown when production has developed and profits have increased. Wages have become higher and higher, and welfare has become better and better. Therefore, after correcting the situation of low wages, there has been a tendency for wages to be too high, and even individual cooperatives have had the bad tendency to divide all the accumulation and eat it all up. Excessive wages and welfare not only eat up the accumulation of cooperatives, encroach on state tax revenue, and borrow more state loans, but also corrode the minds of members, damage the unity within the working people, and are detrimental to all aspects. It should be pointed out that the growth of wages and welfare must gradually grow on the basis of developing production and expanding accumulation. The rate of wage growth must be lower than the rate of labor productivity growth, and must also be adapted to the level of social wages. The wage level of members of handicraft cooperatives (groups) should generally not be higher than that of workers in state-owned factories in the same industry, with the same technical conditions and roughly the same labor productivity in cities; in small towns and rural areas, the historical ratio of income between handicraftsmen and peasants should be taken into account, and should not be much higher than that of peasants. As for labor insurance and welfare, it is also necessary to proceed from reality, according to needs and possibilities, distinguish between priorities, and gradually organize them. The year-end labor dividends of members of handicraft cooperatives should generally not be higher than one month's average salary of the individual.

In addition, some members of handicraft cooperatives have more means of production. In addition to paying share capital when joining the cooperative, the surplus capital is generally deposited in the cooperative at a discounted price. How to deal with this part of the surplus capital deposited in the cooperative at a discounted price is also a matter of the relationship between collective interests and individual interests and the unity within the working people. It must be fully considered and handled with caution. Since this capital deposited in the cooperative at a discounted price basically belongs to the handicraft workers, the principle of repaying the principal is reasonable. As for how much to repay and when to repay, it can be specifically handled according to the cooperative's funds and business conditions, as well as the amount of capital deposited in the cooperative by the members. Generally, it can be used as a member's deposit, paid interest, and repaid in installments. If the capital deposited in the cooperative at a discounted price is very large and the full repayment has a large impact on production or other aspects, the local government can determine a repayment limit, and the part above the limit can be fixed interest.

This nationwide rectification campaign is a good opportunity to rectify cooperatives. Through this rectification campaign, we should better solve the problems that exist between the state, the cooperative, and the members, and educate the members to establish a correct understanding, so that the relationship between these three aspects is closer and more consistent.

On the Issue of Handicraft Mechanization and Transforming Handicraft Cooperatives into State-Owned Factories

According to the new situation after cooperativization, the Party's Eighth National Congress once put forward guiding instructions on the mechanization of some handicraft production and the transformation of some handicraft cooperatives into state-owned factories.

In recent years, some handicraft cooperatives that were established earlier, have normal supply and sales, are larger in scale, and have more accumulation, have gradually implemented semi-mechanized and mechanized production. There are currently about 2,000 such handicraft cooperatives across the country. The vast majority of them have significantly improved labor productivity and product quality, reduced costs, and improved working conditions compared with the manual operation period. These experiences show that in a small number of cooperatives in some handicraft industries, according to the necessary degree and possible conditions, under unified planning, gradually carrying out some technical measures and improvements in certain tools and equipment in the production process is feasible. When improving and adding equipment, old machines replaced by state-owned factories are also used as much as possible.

However, for a considerable period of time, the technical transformation of the handicraft industry must start from the needs of production, combine labor employment and the development of the entire national economy, make overall considerations, and unified planning, and can only be carried out gradually; so as not to cause new contradictions between handicraft cooperatives, between handicraft cooperatives and individual handicrafts, and between handicraft cooperatives and modern industry.

Regarding the issue of transforming handicraft cooperatives into state-owned factories, judging from the pilot projects in some areas, after some handicraft cooperatives have been transformed into state-owned factories, production has been incorporated into the state plan, and they have the conditions to gradually expand and rebuild as needed, which can meet the needs of the country. However, there are also opposite experiences. Some cooperatives should not be changed into state-owned factories, but should maintain their current form, or be changed into cooperative factories belonging to the handicraft federation. This has no impact on production and is convenient for giving play to the enthusiasm of handicraft workers and maintaining the flexibility of production and operation. Because these handicraft cooperatives are in a hurry to be transformed into state-owned factories, and their labor productivity is much lower than that of state-owned factories, and they have to apply a set of state-owned factories in terms of wages and welfare, this increases many unnecessary burdens and reduces the enthusiasm of handicraft cooperatives in production and operation, which is detrimental to production and adapting to social needs.

The productivity of the vast majority of handicraft cooperatives in China is still very low, and the collective ownership of the means of production is generally suitable. If these cooperatives are transformed into state-owned factories too early, it will not only not be beneficial, but even hinder the development of production. In the future, if some cooperatives in various places need to be transformed into state-owned factories, they must be approved by the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region party committees and governments.

On Establishing New Teacher-Student Relationships

In many industries in China's handicraft industry, especially many special handicrafts, a certain skill is required in the production process. These skills have been passed down from teachers to students for thousands of years, generation after generation. The teacher-student system in the old society did have unreasonable feudal things that affected the teaching and development of skills. These unreasonable things have been changed to a certain extent after the national liberation. We should maintain and continue to carry forward the excellent aspects of the teacher-student relationship in the handicraft industry, and constantly overcome and improve the bad aspects, so that this teacher-student relationship can better play its role under the socialist system. However, in some areas of the handicraft industry, apprentices have demanded excessively high treatment, some apprentices have talked about "absolute equality" with their teachers, "made confrontations," and did not respect their teachers; some have even treated the teacher-student relationship as an exploitative relationship. Therefore, teachers are unwilling to take apprentices and unwilling to teach skills. This is not good. On the other hand, some teachers still treat their apprentices with the bad attitudes of the past, which is also not good. After the cooperativization of the handicraft industry, many teacher-student relationships have been interrupted and disrupted. Some of the teacher-student relationships that are maintained have not established appropriate systems. These are all detrimental to the teaching of handicraft skills and the improvement of product quality. We believe that the above-mentioned bad phenomena should be corrected quickly, so as to establish and improve new teacher-student relationships in the handicraft cooperatives. Organize members of handicraft cooperatives to discuss the relevant draft provisions of the State Council's November 20th on the apprentice system. Teachers who take apprentices should be given reasonable subsidies, and contracts should be signed to establish a teacher-student relationship of respecting teachers and loving apprentices, and teaching well and learning fully. At the same time, according to the needs of production development, a part of middle and primary school graduates should be planned to be recruited as apprentices. This is of great significance for cultivating successors for the handicraft industry, teaching and improving handicraft skills.

On the Issue of Cadre Downsizing and Streamlining Institutions

According to statistics at the end of 1956, there were about 40,000 cadres in the federations of handicraft cooperatives at all levels across the country, and about 310,000 cadres and staff members detached from production in grassroots cooperatives. These comrades are the backbone of the handicraft front. They have done a lot of work in the past, and they will play a greater role in the future.

Among the 40,000 cadres in the federations at all levels, except for a small number of cadres who were promoted from grassroots cooperatives, the majority of cadres were transferred from party committees and government agencies at all levels. They have different degrees of cultural level and work experience. Some of them are cadres who have been tempered by revolutionary struggles, but there are also a considerable number of young intellectuals who lack both class struggle and physical labor training. Now, in conjunction with the reorganization of agencies, it seems very necessary to plan to send them to grassroots production units to directly participate in labor training.

Among the 310,000 staff members detached from production in the grassroots cooperatives, the vast majority are handicraft workers in their own industry, and some are master craftsmen and old technicians who have mastered skills. At present, the proportion of full-time personnel in grassroots cooperatives is relatively large, generally around 7%, which increases production costs and promotes bureaucratic tendencies. In the pilot work of great airing of views and debates in some handicraft cooperatives this time, the masses below have raised a lot of opinions on this, indicating that this is one of the rectification contents that must be paid attention to. For this reason, some handicraft cooperatives have adopted the method of "coming from production and returning to production," and strive not to be detached from production, half-detached from production, and less detached from production. The number of personnel detached from production in some handicraft cooperatives has been reduced to about 5%-3%. According to this experience, it seems that it is not only necessary but also possible for most handicraft cooperatives to streamline the personnel detached from production to the lowest necessary limit, in order to increase production personnel, reduce cooperative expenses, closely contact the masses, strengthen cadre training, overcome bureaucracy, and improve leadership style. It must be recognized that this is an important link in improving the management of handicraft cooperatives.

Cadres of handicraft cooperatives must establish the idea of serving handicraft production and handicraft cooperatives for a long time, strive to improve their political and ideological level and cultural level, earnestly study the business and technical issues of their own industry, change from being outsiders to insiders, and gradually train themselves to become "both red and expert" cadres of handicraft cooperatives. The All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives should systematically train cadres of handicraft federations at all levels in rotation, and provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions should also systematically train cadres of county and city federations and key members of grassroots cooperatives in rotation.

On the Transformation of Urban and Rural Individual Handicraft Industries

There are currently more than 670,000 individual handicraftsmen across the country, which is more than double the number left over from the upsurge of handicraft cooperativization. Among them are a small number of members who withdrew from handicraft cooperatives, employees and capitalists who withdrew from joint state-private enterprises. According to the characteristics of China's national economy and the development of the socialist economy, a certain number of individual handicraftsmen will continue to exist for a considerable period of time, and may even develop to some extent under certain conditions. Is it a danger to our socialist economy that a small part of individual handicraftsmen continue to exist? It should be seen that as long as 99% of our country's economy is socialist, then leaving 1%-2% of the individual economy and letting some people move in and out of cooperatives and individual households is not harmful. Of course, we should strengthen our leadership and transformation of them to gradually reduce their market.

Under the current conditions, the individual existence of individual handicraft industries has a negative side, but it still has a positive side. The so-called positive side is that some of them can maintain the flexibility and diversity of production and operation, can produce on the spot and use waste products and waste materials, some have increased the supply of some commodities, and some are refurbishing and repairing old products, which has played a certain supplementary role in the socialist economy. The so-called negative side is that the development of individual handicraft industries is blind. Moreover, a considerable number of individual households, especially those "nouveau riches" who employ a large number of workers, operate without approval, steal illegal profits, and foster serious capitalist tendencies; some have developed into capitalist enterprises. This spontaneous force of blind development and illegal operations not only seriously disrupts market management, but also seriously affects the consolidation of handicraft cooperatives. Therefore, if it is not controlled, it will become a capitalist countercurrent in socialist construction.

Therefore, we can adopt the policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation for the individual handicraft industries that remain under the current conditions, and treat them differently according to different situations. We must not only give play to its active role in adapting to social needs, but also restrict its capitalist spontaneous tendencies; we must not only take care of social labor employment, but also strictly control its blind development. We should strengthen the management of the individual handicraft industries that have developed, restrict their exploitation of employees, encourage them to change the existing employment relationship to a labor partnership relationship, and absorb them into handicraft cooperatives in a planned manner according to the principle of voluntariness. We should carry out resolute struggles against some "nouveau riches" and bad elements who violate laws and regulations, as well as capitalists who withdraw from factories and cooperatives, and stop their speculative activities.

In rural areas, the handicraft industry has generally not been completely separated from agriculture. Handicraftsmen in rural areas are both peasants and producers of commodity handicrafts; their lives depend on both agriculture and handicrafts. This part of the handicraft industry is an integral part of the entire rural economy. They are closely related to agriculture in terms of the arrangement of rural labor, the level of labor remuneration, and the supply of raw materials and the sale of products. Therefore, in order to facilitate the unified planning of the rural economy and take care of the interests of this part of the handicraftsmen, it is more beneficial to classify this part of the handicraft industry into the agricultural sector and transform it together with agriculture. Some handicraft cooperatives (groups) that have been organized in rural areas can merge into agricultural cooperatives as sideline production units according to the principle of voluntary mutual benefit and benefiting production. However, some handicraft cooperatives (groups) that are not convenient or unwilling to merge with agricultural cooperatives can continue to serve as grassroots organizations of the handicraft federation. As for some repair service handicraftsmen in rural areas who have always been working alone, and who do not need or are not convenient to work collectively at present, after they voluntarily participate in agricultural cooperatives, they can continue to operate in the original way; outside of the time they are engaged in handicraft production and operation, they can participate in agricultural labor and be given remuneration. Experience has proved that as long as the principle of voluntary mutual benefit is implemented, laborers engaged in agriculture and laborers engaged in handicrafts can better unite with each other and develop production in a complementary way.

　　关于手工业合作化后的任务和工作问题
    国务院第四办公室贾拓夫主任12月17日在中华全国手工业合作社第一次社员代表大会上的报告摘要
    这次全国手工业合作社社员代表大会的召开，是具有重大的历史意义的。这样的大会在我国手工业历史上还是第一次。这是我国手工业已经由个体经济转到集体经济的社会主义胜利大会，也是我国手工业劳动者在这个胜利的基础上继续前进的大会。经过这次大会，将要进一步巩固和提高手工业合作社，继续完成对手工业的社会主义改造的任务，充分发扬对社会主义建设的高度热情，掀起新的日益壮阔的生产高潮，来迎接即将展开的伟大的第二个五年计划。我谨代表国务院向大会致以热烈的祝贺，并且预祝大会的成功。
    今后三年到五年内的基本任务
    我国是一个现代工业比较落后、但手工业却很发达的国家。手工业生产有悠久的历史和广泛的群众基础。全国手工业生产人员约有两千万人左右，其中专业的手工业者约有八百万人左右。不仅许多中、小城镇的工业，几乎全部是手工业，而且在大城市中，也有相当数量的手工业。在第一个五年计划期间，手工业生产总值预计约占全国工业生产总值的18％左右。手工业的行业很多，产品多种多样；既有制造性的行业，又有修理服务性的行业，既有生产资料，又有生活资料，还有工艺美术品。手工业的生产经营也很灵活，既有固定工场成批生产，又有零活加工，翻新补旧，还有串街游乡，登门上户；手工业能够充分利用分散的、小量的资源以及现代工业的下脚料和废料。同时手工业既可以依靠自己的积累来扩大一部分再生产，以满足社会需要，减少国家在这方面的投资；还可以吸收一部分多余劳动力，扩大社会就业面。因此，手工业在适应分散的、复杂的、变化多端的社会需要、支援农业生产、支援国家建设、供应出口需要以及为国家积累资金等方面，都起着重要的、不可缺少的作用。
    但是，我们也应该看到手工业生产在个体经济的时候，一般的是有分散、落后、盲目、保守的一面，在生产上也是存在着用料多、出品率低、成本高、劳动条件差等弱点。这些缺点，经过社会主义改造之后，正在逐步得到改进，虽然在改造初期也还难以全部消除。我们有些同志对手工业的缺点看得多，而对它的优点、它在国民经济中的地位和作用却认识不足，因此，对手工业缺乏应有的注意，认为没有搞头，没有前途；或者盲目地把手工业生产进行机械化，过早地把手工业合作社转变为国营工厂。这些都是不对的。
    社会主义工业化主要的应当是现代工业，没有现代工业就不可能实现社会主义工业化。但是，这并不是说，社会主义的工业全部都只是现代工业，而不要任何手工业。社会主义的工业，不仅要以大型工业为主体，要有中、小型工业的配合，而且也还必须有手工业作为现代工业的助手，以补现代工业之不足。大家知道，我国的面积很大，人口很多，工业发展很不平衡，就社会主义建设的发展远景来说，有一部分手工业，将要为现代工业所代替；有一部分手工业将逐步发展成为现代工业。两者都是我国国民经济向现代化转变的重要标志，显然是有利于社会主义事业的，是必要的。但是，也必然还有大部分手工业在相当长的时期内，不必要也不可能为现代工业所代替，不必要也不可能发展成为现代工业，这一部分手工业将和现代工业长期并存。因此，在发展现代工业的同时，还应该利用和适当地发展手工业生产的潜力。
    党和政府对于手工业历来给予很大的注意和关怀。在积极扶持手工业生产、充分发挥它在国民经济中的作用的同时，又积极地、有步骤地引导分散、落后的个体手工业，逐步向着集体化的方向发展。我们党和政府历来就认为：只有通过集体化的道路，才能把手工业的生产力解放出来，使广大的手工业劳动者永远摆脱贫穷、困苦的资本主义的道路，以便更好地发挥手工业的积极作用，加速社会主义建设。
    我国手工业在合作化之后，显示了巨大的优越性，证明合作社远比单干好。
    现在，我国第一个五年计划已经胜利地完成和超额完成，手工业的第一个五年计划也已经超额完成，规模更为宏大的第二个五年计划即将开始。党和国家要求在今后十年内争取实现全国农业发展纲要四十条所规定的目标，在十五年后，争取在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国，把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。到那个时候，苏联的工农业将要在最重要产品的产量方面赶上或者超过美国。这样，社会主义国家就可以把帝国主义国家远远地抛在后面。这是一个非常光荣伟大而艰巨的任务。全国手工业劳动者既然是国民经济中一个重要的生产力量，就必须在这个光荣伟大和艰巨的任务下面分担一部分应尽的责任，充分发挥手工业在伟大建设中的积极作用。我相信，全体手工业劳动者和全国人民一道，能够克服一切可能遇到的困难，完成自己应尽的任务。我们的理想一定能够实现。但是，我们也应该看到，我国本来就是人口多、土地少、底子穷，工业和农业生产水平比较低，国家积累和建设物资也不够充裕，科学、文化和技术力量也比较薄弱，因而要逐步实现这样伟大的任务，就必须坚持执行增产节约、勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办合作社、勤俭持家、勤俭办一切事业的方针，从各方面挖掘潜力，按照党中央提出的又多又快又好又省的建设方针进行社会主义建设。
    在今后三年到五年内，应该基本上做到从政治上、思想上、组织上、经济上进一步巩固和提高现有的手工业合作社；在全国手工业合作社巩固和提高的基础上，努力发展生产。全国手工业合作社应该在第二个五年计划内，根据国家的需要和供销的可能，力求每年生产总值的增长速度不低于工农业生产总值同期的平均增长速度；并且应该结合有关部门，加强对供销生产社、供销生产小组和个体手工业者的领导与改造，能够做到基本上克服资本主义的自发倾向，继续完成社会主义的改造任务。我们要求每一个手工业合作社和各级联社都能够根据这些远大的目标和自己的具体情况，制订出积极可靠的全面规划，并且发动全体手工业劳动者百倍努力，以保证其全部实现。
    为了实现这些任务，我们必须注意和解决以下若干问题：
　　关于整风、整社和社会主义教育问题
    我国手工业在所有制问题上谁战胜谁的问题虽然已经基本解决，但是在政治战线上和思想战线上谁战胜谁的问题还不能说已经得到解决。应该看到，手工业者是劳动者，但也是小私有者。正因为他们是劳动者，所以他们能够在工人阶级领导下，坚决走社会主义的道路，这是好的一面，也是基本的一面。但是另一面，也正因为他们是小私有者，所以很容易接受资本主义的思想影响。这就是为什么有必要对手工业者进行社会主义改造的道理。我国手工业合作社今天的社员，大都是不久以前的个体的小生产者，在他们中间手工业工人和贫苦独立劳动者占大多数，他们基本上是热烈拥护合作化制度的，然而就是在这些人中间，在没有进行彻底的社会主义改造之前，也有不少的人可能受资产阶级的思想影响。在原来的小业主和一部分富裕的独立劳动者中，资本主义倾向就更为严重。还有极少数心怀不满的坏分子和反社会主义分子，在合作社中进行破坏活动，甚至篡夺了个别合作社的领导权，把某些合作社引向投机违法的道路。因此，在手工业合作社系统中，进行广泛的整风运动就成为非常必要和刻不容缓的政治任务，以便通过整风，对广大的手工业劳动者进行普遍的、深入的接受社会主义改造的思想教育。
    根据邓小平同志在党的三中全会上报告的精神：手工业合作社的整风，必须充分发扬手工业工人和贫苦独立劳动者走社会主义道路的积极性，注意团结比较富裕的、有技术的社员，揭露和批判原来的小业主和一部分富裕独立劳动者的资本主义倾向，制止坏分子的破坏活动。这样，才能依靠群众的大多数，树立手工业工人和贫苦独立劳动者的领导优势，保证整风运动的健康发展。
    手工业合作社的整风，必须和整社相结合。既要相信群众的多数，放手发动群众，进行大鸣、大放，使群众畅所欲言，在大鸣大放的基础上，大胆地改、坚决地改、彻底地改，依靠群众，狠狠地整顿作风、整顿组织、改进工作、提高生产。在鸣放比较彻底，可以改的问题都做了改正之后，对一些重大的问题，又要组织大争、大辩，通过摆事实、讲道理、回忆、对比、算细账等方法，使群众弄清是非，从而提高社员的社会主义觉悟，巩固手工业合作社。
    要求全国手工业合作社的整风运动，能够在1958年上半年有计划、有领导地普遍展开。在手工业合作社的整风运动中，不但要做到生产整风两不误，而且要做到生产思想两提高。随着整风运动的广泛深入，在手工业合作社必然会出现新的生产高潮。我们必须做好准备，迎接这个高潮的到来。
    当然，广大社员所存在的小生产者的思想影响，不是一朝一夕或者一两次运动所能完全清除掉的。必须在整风运动的基础上，不断地加强对社员的社会主义教育，把手工业合作系统中的政治思想工作经常地坚持下去。
    关于集中生产和分散生产的问题
    一年来，各地在调整和整顿手工业合作社的生产和组织方面的经验证明：手工业合作化以后，必须适当地解决集中生产和分散生产的问题，否则对生产的发展是不利的。要适当地解决这个问题，必须根据各行业的特点和具体条件，从有利于生产、有利于为居民服务和不影响社员收入的原则出发，来确定生产和经营的集中或分散程度，随着客观条件的变化和发展，还要相应地进行调整。在一般情况下，有些制造性行业的合作社，产品规格单一，而且是成批生产，原料供应和产品销售都是通过国营商业和合作社营商业；或者是生产分工较细、技术要求较高、协作关系密切，在某些生产过程中，能够而且需要逐步采用机器生产的，如果厂房、干部等条件具备，吃饭、宿舍等问题可以解决，家庭辅助劳动能够妥善安排，经过社员同意，可以适当地集中生产，实行统一供销、统一计算盈亏的办法。当然，在进行时，必须谨慎从事；同时要注意，集中生产的合作社，规模也不宜过大。至于那些多行业的混合社和全县、全行业一竿子插到底的大社，都是不合理的。有些生产零星多样、产品直接与消费者见面的合作社（组），以及以门市零活加工为主的合作社（组），一般是宜小不宜大，有的可以以小组为单位，进行生产；小组也可以自购自销，单独计算盈亏。修理服务性的手工业合作社（组）一般是宜于分散，也可以采取各负盈亏、分户生产，或流动服务的办法。对于接受加工订货任务的家庭手工业，宜于成立分散生产、统一供销、按件计发工资的手工业合作社（组）。
    手工业合作化高潮以后，有些手工业合作社（组）在这个问题上处理不适当的，已经进行了调整，取得了不少经验。目前有些社（组）对这个问题需要调整还未调整的，以及随着客观条件的变化和发展，现在又需要调整的，都应当及时进行调整。
    关于手工业合作社的生产管理问题
    手工业合作社是劳动群众的集体经济组织，它的生产管理，必须按照民主集中制的原则，按照社章的规定，贯彻执行民主办社、勤俭办社的方针。应该建立和健全社员大会或社员代表大会制度，以便更好地团结全体社员，发挥集体力量，加强生产管理，推动生产发展，提高产品质量，增加花色品种，提高服务质量。
    这几年来，在手工业合作社的生产管理方面，已经积累了不少的经验，有了不少的改进；但是从发展的要求来看，还是很不够的，还需要进一步总结这方面的经验，加以推广，以便提高手工业合作社的管理水平。
    手工业合作社的生产管理，根据一些先进社的经验看来，有计划管理、技术管理和财务管理等几个主要方面。但是，必须指出，手工业合作社有它本身的特点，手工业的一切管理方法，必须从这些特点出发，现代工厂的一套生产管理办法，手工业合作社虽然可以参考，但是决不能机械地搬用。而且在手工业合作社之间也各有不同的特点，因此，管理办法也不能强求一律。
    从1958年起，手工业计划将列入国家和地方的工业计划，因此，对手工业生产加强计划管理，就更有必要。但是对手工业计划管理办法，必须是简便易行，而且要有一定的灵活性，指标不能太多，报表力求精简。对于某些产品固定和成批生产的合作社，可以根据不同的管理水平，逐步推行简单的行之有效的作业计划；对于产品零星、复杂和修理服务性的合作社，则只能有月度或季度的参考性的计划，而在月度和季度内，主要是采取定期的或不定期的派工派活的办法，来安排生产，适应市场千变万化的需要。在劳动组织方面，即使是集中生产和成批生产的合作社，也要区别不同的生产情况，具体确定。对于大量生产的、品种规格简单的产品，可以采取流水作业的办法；对于小量生产的、品种规格复杂的产品，应当采取小组分工以及单人作业的办法。根据手工业产品的特点，一般不宜采取流水作业的办法。对于产品多样复杂、小批或单独生产的合作社，尤其是生产独特产品和名牌货的，以及修理服务性的合作社，更不能采取流水作业的办法。可以考虑按产品类型，以主要工序为中心，划分小组或者实行单人作业的办法。由于有些手工业还存在着以旺养淡的情况，因此，在劳动时间上，要灵活掌握，适应淡旺季的特点和生产经营的需要，不要规定得过死。在技术管理方面，应该注意逐步制订比较简单的产品质量标准和操作要点，建立易于执行的检验制度，以保证和提高产品质量。特别值得注意的是要加强手工业合作社的财务管理工作，这是目前管理工作的薄弱环节。应该使所有的手工业合作社都做到日清、月结，帐实相符，定期公布帐目，发动群众监督，防止和克服贪污浪费现象。
    手工业生产一般还必须贯彻执行就地取材、就地制造、就地销售的原则，原料来自外地、产品销于外地的一些手工业合作社，应当直接同外地有关部门密切联系，保持合理的物资流转方向。同时，手工业产品的销售和原料的采购，也必须服从国家的市场管理和价格管理，不得抬价压价和抢购倒卖原料。
　　关于正确处理国家、手工业合作社和社员三者之间的关系
    在我们社会主义国家里，国家是劳动人民共同利益的代表，劳动人民是国家的主人。国家、手工业合作社、社员三者之间的根本利益是完全一致、不可分割的。
    从国家和手工业合作社的关系来说，除了党和国家对手工业合作社从政治上加强领导和支持以外，在手工业合作化的初期，国家曾经拨出一亿三千多万元作为手工业合作社的基金和经费补助；在税收和银行信贷方面，对手工业合作社也有很多的照顾。最近国务院又决定：手工业合作社所需要的国家统一分配和部管的原材料，除煤炭需要根据用途规定价格外，其余都按照低于市场价格的调拨价格供应，国营商业和供销合作社在原料供应和产品推销方面，也给了手工业合作社很多便利。这些财政上和物资上的大力支持，是手工业合作社生产发展的重要条件。同时，手工业合作社的生产发展，也为国家创造了巨大的财富，供应了市场需要，增加了国家税收。将来在生产继续发展的基础上，还要为国家做出更多的贡献。
    从手工业合作社和社员的关系来说：手工业合作社和社员是相依为命的。在一方面，社员依靠合作社的集体力量，才能克服个体生产时期的各种困难，大大地提高了劳动生产率；手工业合作社巩固了，社员的生产和生活才有了保障，并且随着生产的发展，社员的物质和文化生活水平才能够逐步提高。在另一方面，手工业合作社的生产发展，决定于广大社员的努力；而社员生活有了改善，就会激发他们进一步发挥积极性和创造性，从而更有力地推动生产。
    因此，在党和国家的领导和支持下发展起来的手工业合作社，应当模范地遵守国家的政策法令，承担自己应尽的义务，并且还要随着生产的发展，争取负担较大的义务，坚决同一切投机取巧、损害国家和消费者利益的现象作斗争。每个社员应当爱国、爱社、以社为家，反对贪污盗窃、消极怠工和其他损公利私的不法行为。手工业合作社也应当经常关心社员的疾苦，注意逐步改善社员的生活。
    当然，这并不是说，国家、集体和个人三者之间就没有矛盾了。矛盾是有的，问题在于如何正确地处理这些矛盾。
    正确处理这些矛盾的原则，应该是个人利益服从集体利益，局部利益服从全局利益，目前利益服从长远利益。反过来说，集体利益也要照顾个人利益，全局利益也要照顾局部利益，长远利益也要照顾目前利益。
    目前，在国家、手工业合作社和社员之间的关系中，最突出的是积累和消费的分配问题。几年来，在发展生产的基础上，社员的工资收入有所增加，生活有所改善。1956年手工业合作化高潮之后，曾经针对当时部分合作社部分社员的收入有所下降的情况，提出了“先工资、次治病、后积累”的原则，使大多数社员收入有所增加，治病的困难有所解决，这样做是正确的。但是，有些合作社片面地理解这一点，在生产发展、利润增加的时候，小生产者的资本主义自发倾向也有所滋长，工资高了还要高，福利好了还要好，因而在纠正工资偏低的情况之后，又出现了工资偏高的趋势，甚至个别合作社发生把积累分光、吃光的不良倾向。工资福利过高，不仅吃掉了合作社的积累，侵占了国家的税收，多借了国家的贷款，还腐蚀了社员的思想，损害了劳动人民内部的团结，对各方面都是不利的。应当指出，工资、福利的增长，必须是在发展生产、扩大积累的基础上逐步地增长。工资增长的幅度，必须低于劳动生产率增长的幅度，而且还要和社会工资水平相适应。手工业合作社（组）社员的工资水平，在城市一般不应高于当地同行业、同等技术条件的和劳动生产率大体相同的国营工厂工人；在小城镇和农村应该照顾手工业者和农民历史上收入的比例水平，不应该高出农民太多。至于劳保福利，也要从实际出发，根据需要和可能，分别轻重缓急，逐步举办。手工业合作社社员的年终劳动分红，一般不应当高出本人一个月的平均工资。
    此外，有些手工业合作社社员有较多生产资料，入社时除了应缴股金以外，多余的资财，一般是折价存社。对于这部分折价存社的多余资财如何处理，也是有关集体利益与个人利益的关系和劳动人民内部团结的问题，必须全面考虑，慎重处理。由于这些折价存社的资财，基本上是属于手工业劳动者所有，因此，原则上采取还本的办法是合理的。至于还本多少和还本的时间，可以根据合作社的基金和业务情况，以及社员存社资财的多少来具体处理。一般可以作为社员存款，支付利息，并且分期分批偿还，如果折价存社的资财很大，全部还本对于生产或者其他方面影响较多的，可以由地方政府确定一个偿还的限额，限额以上的部分，采取定息的办法。
    这次全民整风是很好的整社时机。应该通过这次整风，更好地解决国家、合作社和社员三者之间存在的问题，并且教育社员树立正确的认识，使得这三方面的关系更加密切，更加一致。
    关于手工业机械化和手工业合作社转变为国营工厂问题
    党的“八大”根据合作化以后的新情况，曾经对一部分手工业生产的机械化以及某些手工业合作社转变为国营工厂问题，提出了方针性的指示。
    几年来，有些成立较早、供销正常、规模较大、积累较多的手工业合作社，已经逐步实行了半机械化和机械化生产。像这样的手工业合作社，目前全国约有两千多个。其中绝大多数比手工操作时期显著地提高了劳动生产率和产品质量，降低了成本，改善了劳动条件。这些经验说明在一部分手工业行业中的少数合作社，根据必要的程度和可能的条件，按照花钱少、收效快的原则，在统一规划之下，逐步地进行一些在生产环节上的技术措施和某些工具、设备的改进，是可行的。在改进和增添设备的时候，也尽可能地利用了国营工厂替换下来的旧机器。
    但是，在一个相当长的时期内，手工业的技术改造，必须从生产需要出发，结合劳动就业和整个国民经济发展的状况，来通盘考虑，统一规划，并且只能是逐步地进行；以免引起手工业合作社之间、手工业合作社和个体手工业之间、以及手工业合作社和现代工业之间发生新的矛盾。
    关于手工业合作社转变为国营工厂问题，从某些地区的试点情况来看，有的手工业合作社在转变为国营工厂以后，生产已经纳入国家计划，并且有条件根据需要逐步进行扩建、改建，能够符合国家的需要。但是，也有相反的经验，有些合作社不应当改为国营工厂，而宜于保持目前的形式，或者是改变为手工业联社所属的合作工厂，对于生产并无影响，而且便于发挥手工业劳动者的积极性和保持生产经营的灵活性。由于把这些手工业合作社急于转变为国营工厂，而它们在劳动生产率方面低于国营工厂很多，而在工资福利方面又要搬用国营工厂的一套，这就增加了许多不必要的负担，降低了手工业合作社在生产经营上的积极性，对于生产和适应社会需要都是不利的。
    我国目前极大多数手工业合作社的生产力还很低，集体所有制的生产关系一般还是适应的。如果过早地把这些合作社转变为国营工厂，不但没有好处，甚至还要妨碍生产的发展。今后各地有些合作社如果需要转变为国营工厂的时候，必须经过省、市、自治区党委和政府批准。
    关于建立新的师徒关系问题
    我国手工业中有不少行业，特别是很多特种手工艺，在生产过程中，需要有一定的技艺，这些技艺，千百年来都是师傅传授徒弟，一代一代传留下来。在旧社会的师徒制度，确有不合理的封建性的东西，影响技艺的传授和发展。这些不合理的东西在全国解放以后，已经有了一定的改变。我们应该保持和继续发扬手工业师徒关系中优良的一面，而不断地克服和改进不良的一面，以便使这种师徒关系在社会主义制度之下更好地发挥它的作用。但是有些地区的手工业中，曾经发生徒弟要求过高的待遇，有的徒弟同师傅讲“绝对平等”，“闹对抗”，不尊重师傅；有的甚至将师徒关系按照剥削关系来处理。因此，师傅就不愿招收徒弟，不愿传授技术。这是不好的。另一方面，有些师傅仍然沿用旧日的恶劣态度对待徒弟，这也是不好的。手工业合作化以后，更有不少的师徒关系被打断、打乱。有些保持着师徒关系的，也没有建立起适当的制度。这些都是对于手工业技艺的传授和产品质量的提高不利的。我们认为，上述这些不良现象应当很快地加以纠正，从而在手工业合作社中建立和健全新的师徒关系。组织手工业合作社的社员讨论国务院十一月二十日关于学徒制度的有关规定草案。对带徒弟的师傅应该给予合理的津贴，并且订立合同，树立尊师爱徒，教好学全的师徒关系。同时，根据生产发展的需要，有计划地招收一部分中、小学毕业生当学徒。这对于培养手工业后继人材、传授和提高手工技艺，有着重要的意义。
    关于干部下放和紧缩机构问题
    根据1956年底的统计，全国各级手工业联社的干部大约有四万多人，基层社的脱离生产干部和职员大约有三十一万多人。这些同志是手工业战线上的骨干。他们过去做了很多工作，今后还要起更大的作用。
    各级联社的四万干部中，除少数干部是由基层社提拔的手工业劳动者以外，大多数干部是由各级党委和政府机关中抽调来的，他们具有不同程度的文化水平和工作经验。其中有些是经过革命斗争锻炼的干部，但也有相当数量的青年知识分子，他们既缺乏阶级斗争的锻炼，又缺乏体力劳动的锻炼。现在结合机关整编，有计划地将他们下放到基层生产单位，直接参加劳动锻炼，看来是十分必要的。
    在基层社的三十一万脱离生产人员中，绝大多数是本行本业的手工业劳动者，有些还是掌握技艺的老师傅、老技工。目前基层社脱产人员的比重较大，一般在7％左右，这就增大了生产成本，助长了官僚主义倾向。这次某些手工业合作社在大鸣大放的试点工作中，下面群众对此提了不少意见，说明这是必须注意的整改内容之一。为此，有些手工业合作社已经采取了“来自生产、回到生产”的办法，力求不脱离生产、半脱离生产和少脱离生产。有的手工业合作社的脱离生产人员已经减少到5％—3％左右。根据这个经验看来，大多数手工业合作社把脱产人员紧缩到5％—3％，不仅是必要的，而且也是可能的。我们希望全国手工业合作社在这次整风运动中，都能够向这些先进社看齐，把自己的脱离生产人员紧缩到最低必需限度，借以增加生产人员，减少社务开支，密切联系群众，加强干部锻炼，克服官僚主义，改进领导作风。必须认识，这是改进手工业合作社管理的重要一环。
    手工业合作社的干部必须树立长期为手工业生产和手工业合作社服务的思想，努力提高自己的政治思想水平和文化水平，认真钻研本行业的业务问题和技术问题，变外行为内行，使自己逐步锻炼成为“又红又专”的手工业合作社干部，全国手工业合作总社应当有计划地轮训各级手工业联社的干部，各省、市、自治区也要有计划地轮训县、市联社干部和基层合作社的骨干。
    关于对城乡个体手工业的改造问题
    全国目前还有个体手工业者六十七万多人，这个数目较之手工业合作化高潮后当时遗留下的人数增加了一倍以上。其中还有少数退出手工业合作社的社员、退出公私合营工厂的职工和资方人员。根据我国国民经济的特点和社会主义经济发展的情况，在相当长的时间内，一定数量的个体手工业者将会继续存在，并且在一定条件下还可能有所发展。有一小部分个体手工业者继续存在，这对于我们的社会主义经济是否就是一种危险呢？应当看到，我们国家的经济只要99％是社会主义的，那末，留下1％—2％的个体经济，让一些人在合作社和个体户之间进进出出，并没有什么坏处。当然，我们应该加强对他们的领导和改造，以逐步缩小他们的市场。
    在目前条件下，个别存在的个体手工业固然有消极的一面，但是，也仍然有积极的一面。所谓积极的一面，就是它们有些人能够保持生产经营的灵活性和多样性，能够就地取材和利用废品废料进行生产，有的增加了一些商品的供应，有的进行着翻新补旧，对社会主义经济起了一定的补充作用。所谓消极的一面，就是手工业个体户的发展带有盲目性。而且相当多的个体户特别是那些大量雇工的“暴发户”，未经批准，擅自经营，窃取非法利润，滋长着严重的资本主义倾向；有的已经发展成为资本主义企业。这种盲目发展的自发势力和非法经营，不仅严重地破坏市场管理，也严重地影响手工业合作社的巩固。因而如不加以管制，就会成为社会主义建设中的一股资本主义逆流。
      因此，我们对于在目前条件下残存的个体手工业，可以采取利用、限制、改造的方针，按照不同的情况，区别对待。既要发挥它在适应社会需要方面的积极作用，又要限制它的资本主义自发倾向；既要照顾社会劳动就业，又要严格控制它的盲目发展。对于已经发展起来的个体手工业应该加强管理，限制他们的雇工剥削，鼓励他们将现有的雇佣关系改为劳动合伙关系，根据自愿的原则，有计划地吸收他们参加手工业合作社。对一些“暴发户”和违法乱纪的坏分子，以及退厂、退社的资本家，应当进行坚决斗争，制止他们的投机倒把行为。
    在乡村中的手工业，一般还没有完全从农业中分化出来。农村中的手工业者，一方面是农民，一方面又是商品性手工业品的生产者；他们的生活既靠农业，也离不了手工业。这部分手工业，是整个农村经济的一个组成部分。他们在农村劳动力的安排方面，劳动酬报的水平方面，以及原料供应和产品销售等方面，都和农业有密切的关系。因此，为了便于统一规划农村的经济和照顾这一部分手工业者本身的利益，把这部分手工业划归农业方面和农业一起改造，更为有利。农村中的一些已经组织起来的手工业合作社（组），可以根据自愿互利和有利于生产的原则，并入农业合作社，作为副业生产单位。但有些手工业合作社（组）不便于或不愿意同农业社合并的，也可以继续作为手工业联社的基层组织。至于农村中有些修理服务性的手工业者，历来是单独作业的，目前不需要也不便于集体作业的，在他们自愿参加农业合作社以后，仍然可以按照原来的方式继续经营；在他们从事手工业生产经营的时间之外，可以参加农业劳动，给予报酬。经验证明，只要贯彻执行自愿两利的原则，就可以使从事农业的劳动者和从事手工业的劳动者彼此能够更好地团结，相辅相成地发展生产。
    关于现代工业和手工业并存问题
    在我国社会主义建设的过程中，有许多行业是现代工业和手工业并存的。在这些行业中，无论是生产、基本建设，或者是劳动力的安排，也无论是原料供应或者是产品销售，都必须从全面情况出发，贯彻执行统筹兼顾、适当安排的方针。否则不仅对手工业不利，而且对整个国民经济也是不利的。
    在贯彻执行上述方针的时候，应当区分以下五种情况。第一是现代工业和手工业的原料都不足、设备也都有多余的行业，如棉织、针织和制革等。这些行业，目前一般不能增加设备和人员，在安排生产的时候，应该适当照顾手工业的困难。第二是现代工业的设备不足，产品不能满足社会需要，而手工业从业人员较多，生产能力较大的行业，如制糖和造纸等。这些行业，应当根据原料增产的情况，发挥现代工业和手工业生产的潜力，如果现有生产能力不足的时候，首先要改建或新建现代工业，但在不便于发展现代工业的条件下，也可以适当地发展手工业。第三是原材料生产的行业，特别是某些供应不足的原材料，如钢、铁、有色金属、煤炭等，这些行业一方面应该充分发挥现有的现代工业的生产潜力或进行必要的扩建和新建，同时，也应当在有利条件下发挥手工业的生产潜力，允许手工业合作社开办一些小型企业。第四是目前原料困难不大，现代工业设备很少，主要是手工业进行生产的行业，如竹、柳、棕、藤、草等编织行业和砖、瓦、砂、石、石灰、硫磺等的生产。这些行业，可以根据需要，在当地规划之下，有计划地增加生产或维持生产。第五是目前现代工业还代替不了或不需要代替的手工业行业，如特种工艺手工业和为消费者加工、服务性的行业。这些行业，今后主要的是适当地解决原料困难，按照实际情况有计划地发展手工业生产。
    手工业生产所需要的原材料，应当分别情况，统筹供应。对于国家统一分配的物资，应当由国家按计划经过商业部门供应。对于中央和地方规定的统一收购的物资，应当由有关部门按计划供应，或者指定地区，限定数量，按照国家牌价，由手工业合作社自收自用。对于不是由国家统一收购的农副、土产品原料，可以由手工业合作社自收自用。对于手工业中某些名牌产品和工艺美术品，为了保证产品的优良质量，应当供应必要的优质原材料。手工业需要的某些进口原料，应当逐步做到计划供应。对于手工业生产所需的废品废料，一般也应该在统筹安排的原则下，优先照顾。
    手工业生产的发展、手工业合作社的巩固提高和手工业社会主义改造任务的完成，根本关键都在于加强领导，特别是加强地方党组织和合作社内党组织的领导。
    去年下半年以来，中央对手工业管理和改造工作，更多地加重了各省、市、自治区党委和政府的领导责任，有利于及时地、因地制宜地解决手工业生产和改造中存在的问题。经验证明，这是完全正确的。为了加强对手工业的具体领导，便于按行业统一规划和减少手工业同各方面的矛盾，在手工业合作化已经实现的条件下将某些行业的手工业划归工业、商业等有关部门领导和管理，经验证明也是可行的。但是，归口管理以后，手工业合作社生产经营的特点必须保持；集体所有制的性质不能轻易改变，各级手工业联社同各归口部门既要明确分工，又要密切配合。
    目前在全国十万个手工业合作社（组）中，大约有十五万共产党员。为了进一步发挥手工业合作社中党组织的领导作用，我们建议各级党委注意结合这次整风、整社和社会主义教育运动，对原有的党组织认真进行一次整顿，并且有计划地选择具有社会主义觉悟的积极分子，经过培养教育，从中接收适当数量的党员。鉴于手工业劳动者队伍中情况比较复杂，政治思想工作薄弱，因此，发展党员必须更多的进行准备工作，切实保证党的队伍的纯洁性。党在手工业合作社中力量的增大和领导力量的加强，这就使手工业合作社的巩固提高和社会主义改造的彻底胜利有了保证。
