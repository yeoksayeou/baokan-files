Xinhua News Agency, December 28th dispatch from Darjeeling: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said on the 27th that a summit of major powers could ease tensions and create a better psychological atmosphere.

Speaking at a press conference in Darjeeling, Nehru pointed out that the world universally hopes to see the current cold war tensions ease. He said that we hope to find some way to deal with the issue of disarmament on a practical basis, and only major powers taking the initiative can do this.

He said that the door to disarmament is not closed but open. Because it is open, some situation may arise. He also said that if the major powers truly hope to make progress on this issue, various methods can be found, whatever they may be.

Nehru said that although he does not feel optimistic, some recent signs indicate that solving the disarmament issue is possible.

This newspaper's comprehensive report: According to Xinhua News Agency, political and press circles in Western countries continue to demand high-level East-West talks.

According to a report by "France-Soir's" Washington correspondent, many prominent American diplomats "disagree with Dulles' publicly or privately expressed view that it is impossible to negotiate with the Russians." The reporter pointed out that Stassen and those who support Stassen believe that "the time for negotiations with the Soviet Union has come."

The "New York American Journal" published an editorial suggesting that, after proper preparation, a meeting between Eisenhower and Khrushchev should be arranged. The newspaper said: "People place unlimited hope in such a meeting, hoping it will lead to genuine mutual understanding."

The "Peace Action Report" published an article by retired Brigadier General Hoest, who recently visited the Soviet Union. Hoest emphasized that he saw the desire for peace everywhere in the Soviet Union. Based on his observations, the author concludes that international cooperation is possible and appropriate. Hoest said, why doesn't the United States replace the current propaganda at the "diplomatic level" of the past with sincere high-level talks?

The "Washington Star" on the 26th refuted the argument that the differences between the United States and the Soviet Union "can never be reconciled." The newspaper said: "Nothing in history, or even in recent experience, supports this estimate of the situation." The newspaper believes that the possibility of an American Secretary of State visiting Moscow should not be ruled out.

British Liberal Party leader Grimond published an open letter in "The Times," pointing out that among the members of the three political parties (Conservative, Labour, and Liberal) in the British Parliament, many hold a positive attitude towards the idea of negotiating with the Soviet Union. Grimond pointed out that, according to the general opinion of Parliament, the negotiations should first resolve the issues of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe, disarmament, and the situation in the Near East. The Western powers should make a decision to negotiate with the Soviet Union in the near future.

British Labour MP Hughes commented in the "Peace News" weekly on the results of the North Atlantic Group's Paris meeting, saying that Bulgarian's letters and the "facts of the current situation" have had an impact, "no matter how much the Americans and their puppets object, they can no longer ignore the mood of the people of Western Europe: people living under the threat of hydrogen bombs and rockets demand that the gentlemen of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization abandon the illusion that they can continue the arms race and win, and discuss with the Russians some way to replace the arms race that ultimately leads to war."

"Reno News" also published an editorial entitled "Quickly Accept Russia's Proposal," advocating immediate negotiations with the Soviet Union on the issue of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe and the Middle East issue.

The newspaper said, "Because Eisenhower-Macmillan, Dulles-Lloyd refused to realistically and with far-sightedness face the new situation caused by space projectiles and intercontinental ballistic missiles," the leaders of the American and British governments have "lost the trust of their allies and the support of their own people."

The newspaper pointed out: The United States and Britain "suffered a setback" at the North Atlantic Group's Paris meeting. It emphasized: "The people of Europe demand new talks with the Russians. The British Labour Party and some Conservatives have made this demand, and there is no doubt that this demand is receiving increasingly strong support in the United States."

Belgian Liberal Party parliamentary group leader Mourot said he supports the Soviet government's proposal to hold a high-level meeting of Eastern and Western countries, and pointed out that "it is hard to doubt that the Soviets genuinely hope to hold this meeting fruitfully." Mourot emphasized: "Negotiations must be conducted, this is Europe's task. This determines Europe's survival. Every possibility to negotiate should be used."

    人心向往东西方谈判
    尼赫鲁盼大国首脑会谈
    西方政界和报界继续大声疾呼
    新华社28日讯　大吉岭消息：印度总理尼赫鲁27日说，大国首脑会谈可能使得紧张局势缓和，造成较好的心理气氛。
    尼赫鲁在大吉岭举行的记者招待会上指出，全世界普遍希望看到目前的冷战紧张局势缓和下来。他说，我们希望找出某种方法以便能够在切实可行的基础上处理裁军问题，而只有大国采取主动才可能这样做。
    他说，裁军的大门没有关上而是开着的。由于它开着，就可能出现某种情况。他又说，如果各大国真正希望在这个问题上有进展的话，是可以找出各种办法的，不论是些甚么办法。
    尼赫鲁说，虽然他并不感到乐观，但是最近的一些迹象表明解决裁军问题是有可能的。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：西方国家政界和报界继续要求举行东西方高级会谈。
    据“法兰西晚报”驻华盛顿的记者报道，美国有很多知名外交人士“不同意杜勒斯在公开或私人场合中所发表不可能同俄国人协商的观点”。记者指出，史塔生和拥护史塔生的人认为，同苏联谈判的“时候已经到了”。
    “纽约美国人日报”发表社论，建议在经过适当的准备之后，安排艾森豪威尔和赫鲁晓夫的会谈。报纸说：“人们正是对这样的会谈寄以无限的希望，希望它能导致真正的相互了解。”
    “和平行动报”发表了不久前访问过苏联的、退职准将赫斯特写的一篇文章。赫斯特强调指出，他在苏联到处都看到要求和平的愿望。作者根据自己的观察得出结论说，国际合作是可能的，而且也是适宜的。赫斯特说，为什么美国还不以真心诚意的高级会谈来代替目前的、停留在过去的“外交水平”上的宣传呢？
    “华盛顿明星报”在26日驳斥了所谓美国和苏联之间的分歧“永远不能调和”的论调。报纸说：“在历史上，或者甚至最近的经验中，绝没有任何东西支持对形势的这种估计”。这家报纸认为不应该排斥一个美国国务卿去莫斯科访问的可能性。
    英国自由党领袖格里蒙德在“泰晤士报”发表了一封公开信，指出在英国议会三个政党（保守党、工党和自由党）的议员中，有许多人对同苏联谈判的主张抱积极的态度。格里蒙德指出，根据议会普遍的意见，谈判首先应当解决的是关于在欧洲建立无原子武器地区、裁军和近东局势的问题。西方大国应该在最近期间作出同苏联谈判的决定。
    英国工党议员休斯在“和平新闻”周刊上就北大西洋集团巴黎会议的结果发表评论说，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的信件和“目前局势中的事实”已经产生了影响，“不管美国人和他们的傀儡如何反对，他们再也不能忽视西欧人民的这种情绪：生活在氢弹和火箭威胁下的人民要求北大西洋公约组织的先生们放弃那种认为自己能够继续进行军备竞赛并能获得胜利的幻想，而同俄国人讨论用某种方法来代替最终导致战争的军备竞赛。”
    “雷诺新闻”也发表了题为“快接受俄国的建议”的社论，主张立即就在欧洲建立无原子武器地区的问题和中东问题同苏联谈判。
    这家报纸说，“由于艾森豪威尔—麦克米伦、杜勒斯—劳埃德拒绝现实地和眼光远大地正视空间投射物和洲际弹道导弹所造成的新形势”，美英两国的政府领袖已经“失去了他们的盟国的信任和他们自己人民的支持”。
    报纸指出：美国和英国在北大西洋集团巴黎会议上“遭到了挫折”。它强调说：“欧洲各国人民要求同俄国人举行新的会谈。英国工党和一部分保守党人都提出了这个要求，毫无疑问，这个要求在美国国内也得到越来越强有力的支持。
    比利时自由党议会党团领袖穆罗表示他拥护苏联政府关于举行东西方国家高级会议的建议，并且指出，“苏联人真正希望有成果地举行这个会议，这一点是难以怀疑的。”穆罗强调说：“必须进行谈判，这是欧洲的任务。这决定着欧洲的存亡。应该利用任何可能进行谈判。”
