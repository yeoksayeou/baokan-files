    Funing County's Grain Output Exceeds the Outline Targets
    (Our report) Funing County, Hebei Province, has achieved the grain production increase target set by the National Agricultural Development Outline (Revised Draft) for 1967, ten years ahead of schedule.

    This year, Funing County sowed a total of 574,600 mu of grain crops, with an average yield of over 416 jin per mu, an increase of 43.08% compared to 1955 and an increase of 12.4% compared to last year. In 1957, the county produced a total of 239.25 million jin of grain, an increase of 41.06% compared to the total output in 1955 and an increase of 13.33% compared to last year. This year, the county sold 46 million jin of surplus grain to the state. Of the 111 agricultural cooperatives in the county, 99 have reached or exceeded the production level of local prosperous middle peasants.

    Funing County is located at the foot of the Great Wall, under the Yanshan Mountains, and by the Bohai Sea. The county has four main rivers: the Yang River, the Dai River, the Tang River, and the Shi River. Of the county's 44 townships, 32 are located in mountainous and hilly areas, and 12 are located in plains and coastal areas. 61.9% of the county's cultivated land is on slopes and terraces. Because rainfall is concentrated in July, August, and September, spring droughts and autumn floods have become almost regular occurrences. Therefore, in the past, the yield per mu was said to be "three dou (fifty jin per dou) in the plains, one hundred jin in the mountains." This year's great leap forward in grain production was achieved under these natural and production conditions.

    In 1956, Funing County experienced its first agricultural production upsurge. In that year, the average grain yield per mu reached 370 jin, an increase of 25% compared to 1955. In 1957, the county Party committee proposed a plan to achieve 390 jin per mu, but after discussion in the townships and cooperatives, this target was exceeded. The county Party committee resolved to achieve 400 jin per mu throughout the county.

    This plan was put to the test. This spring, the county encountered a rare drought in its history. In the northern mountainous areas, the soil was dry to a depth of five inches, and in the plains, it was dry to a depth of four inches. In some areas, wells dried up and rivers ran dry, and even drinking water became a problem. At that time, 470,000 mu of corn, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and cotton crops had not been sown, and the seedlings that had already emerged on half of the county's land were withering. The situation was critical. The county Party committee issued the call "Party, government, army, and people all work together to fight the drought, rush to plant, and strive for a bumper harvest." Cadres from all county-level departments, except for those guarding doors and selling goods at counters, were led by members of the county Party committee, going to the countryside day and night to fight the drought to the end, not returning until victory. Every day, more than 140,000 people throughout the county were fighting the drought, accounting for more than 90% of the county's total labor force. The masses' slogans were even more moving:
  “Drain the rivers dry, empty the wells, and we will surely achieve a bumper harvest.” There were few water-lifting tools, so supply and marketing cooperatives and monopoly companies took out oil drums and wine casks to use as water containers. Working day and night for 47 days, the county irrigated more than 29,000 mu of wheat (78.8% of the total wheat area), checked and replanted more than 113,000 mu of seedlings, ensuring full stands; watered and planted 258,200 mu. By June 15, the drought was relieved, and the drought resistance struggle was completely victorious.

    In order to achieve a 400-jin county, Funing County adopted four major measures: The first was water and soil conservation and water conservancy construction. In addition to building some gully dams, terraces, and fish-scale pits, the county Party committee focused on the "contour ditching" project (also called "digging dams"). The benefits of "contour ditching" are: conserving fertilizer and water, preventing water from running down the mountain, eliminating pests, improving the soil, and expanding the planting area. However, there were many difficulties: repairing one mu of "contour ditching" required ten to fifteen man-days, required people who knew how to adjust the dams, and also required large hoes as tools. Some areas did not understand the technology and did not want to learn. The county Party committee decided to launch a "contour ditching" campaign in the barren mountains and slopes stretching dozens of miles from Yuguan to Qixingzhai, including 18 townships and 231 natural villages, covering more than 20,000 mu. Qiang Hua, the first secretary of the county Party committee, and the minister of the county Party committee's rural work department, the minister of the organization department, the deputy director of the office, and the deputy county magistrate, each armed with a large hoe, led more than 30 cadres, going deep into the townships and cooperatives to promote and actually participate in this work, quickly opening up the situation. The county completed a total of 58,300 mu of "contour ditching," with one mu able to increase production by one to two hundred jin. The Yang River is most prone to flooding within Funing County, so the management of the Yang River has been particularly strengthened. In the past two years, more than 500 river dams have been built, and the addition of "contour ditching" has greatly controlled soil erosion. This year, the Yang River no longer floods the land, and it has also been used to irrigate more than 4,000 mu of land.

    The second is pigs and fertilizer. In 1955, the number of pigs raised in the county was 91,809, last year it was 120,000, and this year it has grown to 247,966. In the past, prosperous middle peasants often said "one pig, ten mu of land," but now, the cooperatives have greatly exceeded their standards. Due to the rapid development of pigs, the amount of accumulated fertilizer has increased. This year, an average of 6,600 jin of fertilizer was applied per mu, of which barnyard manure accounted for half.

    The third is to increase the planting of high-yield crops. Based on soil quality and natural conditions, the county this year sowed a total of 396,000 mu of high-yield crops such as corn, rice, sweet potatoes, and multi-headed sorghum, accounting for 68% of the grain crop planting area and 75.6% of the total grain output. This year, the county planted a total of 7,000 mu of multi-headed sorghum, with an average yield of 600 jin per mu, turning low-yield crops into high-yield crops.

    The fourth is to vigorously promote agricultural technology reform. Technology committees or technology groups have been established from the county Party committee to the township and cooperative. In addition, each cooperative also has a technical night school to train members to improve their skills. A total of more than 31,700 technical backbones have been trained throughout the county. Many townships and cooperatives have also hired old farmers as consultants, and each cooperative has small experimental plots. In the past year, improved varieties and other yield-increasing experiences have been promoted more than 20 times throughout the county, and 30,000 person-times have been organized to visit, which has played a significant role in achieving increased production.

    The Funing County Party Committee recently tentatively determined that next year, the average grain yield per mu should be increased to 500 jin. In addition, the average cotton yield per mu should be increased by 10%.

    抚宁县粮食产量超过纲要指标
    本报讯　河北省抚宁县提前十年达到了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的1967年的粮食增产指标。
    抚宁全县今年共播种粮食作物五十七万四千六百亩，平均亩产四百一十六斤多，比1955年增长43.08％，比去年增长12.4％。1957年全县产粮食两亿三千九百二十五万斤，比1955年总产量增加41.06％，比去年增加13.33％。今年卖给国家余粮四千六百万斤。全县一百一十一个农业社中有九十九个社赶上或超过了当地富裕中农的生产水平。
    抚宁县位于长城脚、燕山下、渤海边。境内有洋河、代河、汤河、石河四条主要河流。全县四十四个乡中有三十二个乡分布在山区和丘陵地区，十二个乡分布在平原和沿海。全县61.9％的耕地是坡地和梯田。由于降雨量集中在七、八、九三个月份，春旱秋涝几成规律。因此，过去亩产量有“平原老三斗（五十斤一斗），山区一百斤”的说法。今年粮食生产上的大跃进，就是在这样的自然环境和生产条件下实现的。
    1956年，抚宁县出现了第一个农业生产高潮，这一年粮食平均亩产量达到了三百七十斤，比1955年提高25％，1957年县委提出亩产三百九十斤的计划，拿到乡、社一讨论，又被突破了，县委下决心要全县实现亩产四百斤。
    这个计划经过了考验。今年春天碰到了历史上稀有的旱象。在北部山区，土壤干到五寸，平原干到四寸，部分地区井涸河干，饮水都成了问题。当时，有四十七万亩玉米、花生、白薯、棉花作物未种，相当于全县一半土地已出的禾苗也日显干枯，情况危急。县委发出了“党政军民齐下手，抗旱抢种争丰收”的号召，县级各部门的干部除了留守门的，留守柜台卖货的人以外，都由县委委员带领，星夜下乡，抗旱到底，不胜不回。每天全县抗旱的有十四万多人，占全县劳动力总数的90％以上。群众的口号更动人：
  “把河水浇断，把井水淘干，一定实现大丰产”。提水工具少，供销社、专卖公司把油桶酒篓拿出来作盛水工具。就是这样夜以继日抗旱四十七天，浇麦两万九千多亩（占麦田总面积的78.8％），查苗补苗十一万三千多亩，保证了全苗；浇水点种二十五万八千二百多亩。到6月15日旱象解除，抗旱斗争获得全胜。
    为了实现四百斤县，抚宁县采取了四大措施：头一条是水土保持和水利建设。除修建了些谷坊、梯田、鱼鳞坑等以外，县委着重搞了“等高撩壕”工程（也叫“挖堰”）。“等高撩壕”的好处是：保肥蓄水，水不下山，消灭害虫，改良土壤，扩大种植面积。不过困难很多：修一亩“等高撩壕”需要十到十五个人工，需要会调堰的人材，还需要有大镐作工具。有些地区不懂技术，也不想学习。县委决定从榆关至七星寨纵横几十里的范围内，包括十八个乡、二百三十一个自然村的二万多亩秃山坡地上掀起开展“等高撩壕”运动，县委第一书记强华和县委农村工作部长、组织部长、办公室副主任还有副县长等五人，每人一把大镐，率领三十多名干部，深入乡、社推动和实际参加这项工作，很快打开了局面。全县共完成“等高撩壕”五万八千三百亩，一亩能增产百八十斤。抚宁县境内最好泛滥的是洋河，所以特别加强了对洋河的治理。这两年修了五百多条拦河坝，再加“等高撩壕”很能控制水土流失，今年，洋河不淹地了，还被利用来浇了四千多亩地。
    第二条是猪和肥。1955年全县养猪数是九万一千八百零九口，去年是十二万口，今年已发展到二十四万七千九百六十六口。过去，富裕中农好讲“一口猪，十亩地”，现在，合作社已经大大超过了他们的标准。由于猪只发展的快，积肥数量多了，今年平均每亩施了六千六百斤肥，其中圈肥占一半。
    第三条是增种高产作物。根据土质和自然条件，今年全县共播种玉米、稻谷、白薯、多穗高粱等高产作物三十九万六千多亩，占粮食作物种植面积的68％，占粮食总产量的75.6％。今年全县共种多穗高粱七千亩，平均亩产量达到六百斤，低产作物变成了高产作物了。
    第四条是大力推动农业技术改革。从县委到乡社都建立了技术委员会或技术小组。此外，每社还有一个技术夜校，训练社员提高技术。全县共培养了技术骨干三万一千七百多人。很多乡社还聘请了老农当顾问，各社都有小块试验田。一年来在全县推广了优良品种和其他增产经验二十余次，组织了三万人次参观，对实现增产有相当重大的作用。
    抚宁县委最近初步确定，明年要将粮食平均亩产量提高到五百斤，此外，棉花平均亩产提高10％。
