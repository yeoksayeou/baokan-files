    Paris is a Great Cesspool
    The Paris "Le Monde" published an article not long ago discussing the problem of prostitution in France. The article talked about the serious prevalence of prostitution in Paris, saying that there are approximately 15,000 to 20,000 "professional prostitutes" in Paris who live by selling their bodies, in addition to countless semi-prostitute "amateur prostitutes."

    The article admitted that many people who become prostitutes do so because they are "victims of poverty" when discussing the "social reasons" for the large number of prostitutes.

    At the same time, the article exposed the criminal activities of French brothels in engaging in "trafficking in women" to recruit prostitutes. A case that occurred in France in May of this year showed that those involved in this women's "trade" included "investors," several "women hunters," as well as many "middlemen" and accomplices.

    巴黎是大火坑
    巴黎“世界报”不久以前刊登了一篇论述法国娼妓问题的文章。文章谈到巴黎娼妓盛行的严重情况说：在巴黎，靠卖淫为生的“职业妓女”大约有一万五千人到二万人，此外还有无数的半卖淫的“业余妓女”。
    文章谈到造成娼妓众多的“社会原因”时承认很多沦为妓女的人是“受穷困之害”。
    文章同时揭露了法国妓院为收罗娼妓而从事“买卖妇女”的罪恶勾当。今年5月在法国发生的一个案件表明：参预这种妇女“买卖”的有“投资商”，有若干名“女人搜猎者”，还有许多“中间人”和同谋人。
