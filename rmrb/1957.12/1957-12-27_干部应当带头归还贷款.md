Cadres Should Take the Lead in Returning Loans
　　Jiang Xia
　　The state provides a large number of loans to help farmers solve their production and living difficulties. It is beneficial to both the state and the farmers that farmers return the agricultural loans on time so that they can be turned over in a timely manner and better play their role in supporting agriculture.
　　However, in many places now, agricultural loans due are delayed in being repaid. One of the main reasons for this is that some cadres do not repay their loans when they are due. When the masses look at the cadres, they are not active in repaying their loans either.
　　According to materials from some regions, the phenomenon of cadres defaulting on loans is quite common. Among the cadres above the production team leader level in Nan Cheng Township, Lu'an County, Shanxi Province, 101 people owed 3,358 yuan in overdue and due loans. Some cadres have owed loans for as long as four years; according to statistics from Pingding County, among the more than 3,400 cadres in the county, each person owed an average of more than 35 yuan in loans due. The failure to repay these due loans in a timely manner not only affects the turnover of the state's agricultural loan funds, but more seriously, many people with the ability to repay the loans wait and see when they see that the cadres are not repaying. The masses said: "Party members and cadres are the locomotives, and we, the masses, follow them; if they do not repay their loans, we can delay it for a few years." This creates great difficulties for banks and credit cooperatives in their peak season loan collection work.
　　It is perfectly acceptable for the broad masses of grassroots cadres to borrow some money from banks and credit cooperatives when they encounter temporary difficulties in production and life that are difficult to overcome. If some cadres are currently unable to repay their loans for various reasons, the state banks and credit cooperatives should also allow them to repay part of the loans or appropriately extend the repayment period in accordance with the policy. However, this is not the case for many cadres at present. Some people live a fairly wealthy personal life, but they just do not repay their loans. For example, among the 101 cadres who owed loans in Nan Cheng Township, 25 people bought bicycles.
　　Having money but not repaying is essentially a manifestation of selfish individualism. Some cadres say: "More loans and longer delays are a good thing," and even attempt to ask the state to "unload the burden." It is conceivable how such cadres can mobilize the masses to repay their loans. The people's cadres should put the interests of the people and the country first. If cadres can lead by example and take the lead in repaying loans, the masses will follow the cadres and actively repay their loans. After criticizing his own wrong thoughts, Li Binghua, the deputy township head of Nan Cheng Township, quickly sold his bicycle and paid off the 130 yuan loan he had owed for two years. Under his influence, cadres and masses in the whole township who owed loans voluntarily returned 920 yuan in ten days, greatly promoting the peak season loan collection work. The masses said: "When the locomotive starts, the wheels (masses) follow closely; when the cadres repay their loans, we must hurry up and pay (repay) them too."

    干部应当带头归还贷款
    江夏
    国家以大量贷款帮助农民解决生产生活困难，农民归还到期农贷，使它能及时周转，更好地发挥对农业的支援作用，这对国家对农民都是有利的。
    可是，现在有不少地方到期农贷迟迟不能归还，其主要原因之一，就是有些干部贷款到期不还，群众看干部，也就不积极还贷了。
    根据部分地区的材料，干部拖欠贷款的现象是相当普遍的。山西潞安县南呈乡生产队长以上干部当中，有一百零一人拖欠三千三百五十八元逾期和到期贷款，有的干部拖欠应还贷款竟长达四年之久；又据平定县的统计，全县三千四百多名干部当中，每人平均拖欠三十五元多应还贷款。这些到期的贷款不能及时归还，影响国家农贷资金周转自不用说，更严重的是许多有还款能力的群众，看到干部不还，便也等待观望，迟迟不还。群众说：“党员干部是火车头，咱们群众跟着走；他们贷款不归还，咱也可以拖几年。”这就给银行和信用社旺季收贷工作造成很大困难。
    广大基层干部和群众一样，在生产生活当中遇到了暂时难以克服的困难，向银行和信用社贷一些款，这本来没有什么不可以。有些干部由于种种原因，当下确实无力还贷的，国家银行和信用社也应当按照政策让他们还一部分或适当延长还贷期限。但是，目前有很多干部的情况并不是这样，有的个人生活过得相当富裕，就是不还贷款。如南呈乡一百零一名欠贷的干部当中，就有二十五人买了自行车。
    有钱不还，实质是一种损公利私的个人主义思想在作怪，有的干部就这样说：“贷款多，拖的长，是便宜事”，甚至企图叫国家给“卸包袱”。可以想像，这样的干部怎能去动员群众还贷款呢？人民的干部应以人民和国家的利益为重，如果干部能以身作则，带头还贷款，群众就能跟着干部行动，积极还贷。南呈乡副乡长李丙华在批判了自己的错误思想后，很快把自行车卖掉，还清了拖欠二年的一百三十元贷款。全乡欠贷的干部、群众在他的影响下，十天当中就主动归还了九百二十元贷款，大大地推动了旺季收贷工作。群众说：“火车头开动了，车轮子（群众）紧跟跑；干部贷款归还了，咱也得赶快交（还）。”
