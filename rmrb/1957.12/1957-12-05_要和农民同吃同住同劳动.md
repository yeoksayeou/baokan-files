The cadres sent to the suburbs of Beijing have been there for over three months in some cases, and almost a month in others. They eat and live with the members of the agricultural cooperatives, laboring together and becoming completely integrated. Some people who were not used to coarse grains have become accustomed to them after a short period. Cornbread, cornmeal flatbreads, boiled dumplings, and sweet potatoes have become their regular staple foods; stewed cabbage and salted radish have also become their favorite side dishes.

These transferred cadres originally worked in government offices and spent ten to twenty yuan per month on food. Now, they are saving money on food to avoid too great a difference in living standards from the peasants. Some comrades cook collectively themselves, spending only seven or eight yuan per month, and some especially frugal ones spend only six yuan per month. Although they spend less on food, they eat heartily, and their appetites have greatly increased. Those who used to suffer from insomnia no longer do, and those who couldn't lift heavy loads before can now handle them.

The peasants' frugal and simple lifestyle has greatly educated the transferred cadres; the transferred cadres' learning from the peasants' frugal and simple lifestyle has also brought a very good impression to the peasants.

The transferred cadres enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party and the state, voluntarily participating in supporting the agricultural front, and were prepared and determined to endure hardship. However, some individuals still thought of eating better. For example, some cadres brought bread and butter to spread and eat when they first arrived, some brought noodles and cooked them in their rooms, and some even steamed half a bag of steamed buns and hung them on the wall for future needs. Naturally, the peasants looked at those who brought dry food to eat differently, with respect and distance, and they also seemed very special among the comrades who were sent down together. Therefore, it easily created a distance between the transferred cadres and the peasants, and even created estrangement among the transferred cadres themselves.

Eating and living with the peasants, and laboring together to transform oneself in labor, is the requirement and purpose that transferred cadres should achieve. However, comrades who bring bread, butter, noodles, and steamed buns lack the determination and confidence to develop a frugal and simple lifestyle, and they also have the idea of taking a step back in terms of training their appetites and changing their living habits.

Isn't this detached approach from the masses, unwilling to share weal and woe with the peasants, running counter to the purpose of transforming oneself? Since they have the great determination to go to the countryside, overcoming the trivial problems of life should not be difficult.

　　要和农民同吃同住同劳动
　　戈军
    下放到北京郊区的干部，早的已三个多月，短的也快一个月了。他们同农业社的社员们同吃同住，共同劳动，完全打成了一片。有些人本来吃不惯粗粮的，现在经过一个短时期已经习惯了。窝窝头、玉米面贴饼、煮疙瘩、山芋，成为他们经常的主食；熬白菜、咸萝卜的副食，也被他们喜上了。
    这些下放干部原来在机关，每月要吃十几、二十元，现在都省着吃，以免和农民的生活水平相差太远。有些同志自己集体烧饭，每月只要七、八元就够了，有的特别俭省的每月只吃六元。吃的钱虽然少，可是饭吃的倒挺香，饭量也大大地增加了，原来失眠的不失眠了，原来挑不动的担子，现在也挑得动了。
    农民省吃俭用、艰苦朴素的生活作风，给下放干部很大教育；下放干部学习农民省吃俭用、艰苦朴素的作风，也给农民带来了极好的印象。
    下放干部热烈响应党和国家的号召，自愿参加支援农业战线，都是有吃苦的准备和决心的，但个别的人想吃得好一些的思想是有的。譬如有的干部下去时带了面包黄油抹了吃，有的带了挂面自己在房里生火下，有的还蒸了半袋馒头，挂在墙上，以备不时之需。农民对于这些带了干粮下去吃的人，自然是另眼看待，敬而远之的，在一同下放的同志中也显得很特殊。因此很容易造成下放干部和农民之间的距离，甚至也造成了下放干部相互之间的疏远。
    和农民同吃同住，共同劳动，在劳动中改造自己，这是下放干部应该达到的要求和目的。可是，像带面包黄油、挂面、馒头这样的同志，在养成省吃俭用、艰苦朴素的作风方面，是缺乏决心和信心的，至于在锻炼自己胃口方面，在改变自己生活习惯方面，也是有退一步的想法的。
    这种不愿与农民同甘苦共呼吸的脱离群众的作法，岂不是与改造自己的目的背道而驰？既有下农村的巨大决心，那么克服区区生活上的问题，应该是不困难的。
