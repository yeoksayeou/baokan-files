Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 15th: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee unanimously passed a resolution on consolidating international peace on the 14th. As previously reported, on the evening of December 12th, the Soviet delegation submitted a proposal on a "Declaration of Principles of Peaceful Coexistence" to the Political Committee, requesting that all countries adhere to the following five principles in their mutual relations: mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs for economic, political, or ideological reasons, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, resolving any disputes between countries only through peaceful means.

During the debate on the Soviet proposal, Indian representative Menon put forward a three-nation proposal on the 13th, supported by Sweden and Yugoslavia. This proposal emphasized the urgency and importance of consolidating international peace and developing peaceful neighborly relations between countries, regardless of their differences or the stage and nature of their political, economic, and social development. It considered it necessary to develop peaceful and tolerant relations between countries based on mutual respect, mutual benefit, non-aggression, respect for sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity, and non-interference in internal affairs, in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. The proposal called for expanding international cooperation, easing tensions, and resolving differences and disputes between countries through peaceful means.

Soviet representative Kuznetsov said that the Soviet proposal expressed the principles of peaceful coexistence more clearly and forcefully than the three-nation proposal. However, he did not object to the three-nation proposal. Therefore, the Soviet delegation did not insist on a vote on its proposal and would vote in favor of the three-nation proposal.

During the vote, the three-nation proposal was passed unanimously with seventy-five votes in favor and none against. The Kuomintang elements abstained. Representatives from Ceylon, Haiti, Morocco, Paraguay, Turkey, and the Federation of South Africa were absent.

U.S. representative Lodge superficially supported the three-nation proposal and said that the United States was striving to build mutual trust with the Soviet Union. However, Lodge's entire speech embodied the spirit of the "Cold War." He repeated the anti-Soviet slanders he had delivered more than once on the United Nations platform, attempting to create the illusion that the Soviet Union itself was undermining the principles it had put forward in its declaration proposal on peaceful coexistence between countries. Lodge's speech also showed that, despite the United States' statement of support for the proposal, including the principle of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, it did not intend to abandon its policy of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries (including socialist countries).

In their speeches, the representatives of Britain and France attempted to cast doubt on the sincerity of the Soviet proposals and the great potential and rationality of the Soviet Union's call for peaceful cooperation. Representatives from Spain, the Philippines, Australia, and some Latin American countries echoed the old tunes granted by the U.S. representative, attempting to slander the idea of peaceful coexistence.

After the vote, the work of the Political Committee was declared complete.

　　联大政委会通过巩固和平决议
    美国代表表面上支持但继续鼓吹“冷战”
    新华社15日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会14日一致通过了一项关于巩固国际和平的决议。前已报道，12月12日晚上，苏联代表团在政治委员会上提出了一项关于“和平共处原则宣言”的提案，要求各国在相互关系上遵循：互相尊重领土完整和主权，互不侵犯，不因某种经济、政治或思想意识上的理由互相干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处等五项原则，只用和平方式来解决各国之间发生的任何争端。
    在就苏联提案进行辩论的过程中，印度代表梅农13日在委员会上提出了一个得到瑞典和南斯拉夫支持的三国提案。这个提案强调巩固国际和平和发展各国之间的和平睦邻关系而不管这些国家的分歧或者它们的政治、经济和社会发展的阶段和性质有何不同的迫切性和重要性，认为有必要遵照联合国宪章的规定来发展各国之间以互相尊重、互利、互不侵犯、互相尊重主权、平等、领土完整、互不干涉内政为基础的和平和宽容关系。提案要求扩大国际合作、缓和紧张局势、通过和平方法来解决国与国之间的分歧和纠纷。
    苏联代表库兹涅佐夫说，苏联的提案对于表达和平共处的原则比三国提案更为明确和有力。但是他不反对三国提案。因此苏联代表团不坚持表决它的提案，而将投票赞成三国提案。
    在表决时，三国提案以七十五票赞成、没有人反对一致通过。国民党分子弃权。锡兰、海地、摩洛哥、巴拉圭、土耳其和南非联邦代表缺席。
    美国代表洛奇表面上支持三国提案，并且说美国力图建立同苏联之间的相互信任。但是，洛奇的整个发言都体现出“冷战”的精神。他重复了他在联合国讲坛上发表过不止一次的那套反苏的诽谤，企图造成一种假象，似乎苏联自己在破坏它在关于各国和平共处的宣言提案中所提出的原则。洛奇的发言还表明，尽管美国声明支持包括有不干涉他国内政的原则在内的提案，但是，它并不打算放弃自己干涉他国内政（包括社会主义国家）的政策。
    英国和法国代表在发言中企图使人怀疑苏联建议的诚意以及苏联提出和平合作的巨大可能性和合理性。西班牙、菲律宾、澳大利亚和某些拉丁美洲国家的代表们重弹了美国代表所授予的老调，力图诽谤和平共处的思想。
    在进行表决后，政治委员会的工作宣布全部结束。
