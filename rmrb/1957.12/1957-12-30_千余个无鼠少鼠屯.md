Frontlines of Eliminating the Four Pests

    Over a Thousand Rat-Free and Rat-Scarce Villages
    In eleven counties in western Jilin Province, 408 rat-free villages (i.e., natural villages) have emerged. In addition, there are 952 rat-scarce villages, where the average number of rat holes per hundred houses does not exceed five.
    These eleven counties are mostly grassland areas in the Baicheng Prefecture of Jilin Province, which have historically been plagued by large numbers of wild ground squirrels and brown house rats, totaling thirteen species of rats. This spring, during the period when ground squirrels emerged from hibernation, 800,000 people in the area searched for and exterminated rats on 3.74 million hectares of land. Under the guidance of the provincial epidemic prevention agencies, they placed arsenic-coated corn and zinc phosphide-coated corn into rat holes, poisoning a large number of rats, reducing the average number of ground squirrels per hectare to 0.2, which is one-tenth of the 1951 level.
    From October to November this year, the Chinese Communist Party organizations at all levels in this area actively led the people in launching a large-scale rat-catching campaign. In one and a half months, a total of 10.28 million rats were exterminated. In Changling County, the 89,000 people who participated in the rat-catching campaign caught 1 million rats and collected 370,000 jin of grain. In Dalai County, a total of 92,000 people caught 920,000 rats, and 1,200 rat-catching models emerged who each caught more than 150 rats. Liu Changhai, a student from Jingshan Township in this county, dug out 556 rats of all sizes with a shovel.

    千余个无鼠少鼠屯
    在吉林省西部十一个县里已出现四百零八个无鼠屯（即自然村）。另外，还有九百五十二个少鼠屯，在这些屯内，平均每百间房子的鼠洞不超过五个。
    这十一个县大部是吉林省白城专区的草原地带，历年有大量野居黄鼠和褐色的家鼠等十三种老鼠为害。今年春季黄鼠出蛰时期，这个地区曾有八十万人在三百七十四万公顷的土地上寻洞灭鼠。他们在省防疫机构的指导下，把亚砒酸苞米和磷化锌苞米放进鼠洞，毒死了大批老鼠，使平均每公顷地里的黄鼠减少到零点二只，等于1951年的十分之一。
    在今年10月至11月份，这个地区的中共各级组织又积极领导人民开展了大规模的捕鼠运动。在一个半月之内，共灭鼠一千零二十八万只，长岭县参加捕鼠的八万九千人捕鼠一百万只，拣粮三十七万斤。大赉县全县共九万二千人捕鼠九十二万只，并出现一千二百名每人捕鼠一百五十只以上的捕鼠模范。这个县静山乡学生刘长海用一把铁锹挖出五百五十六只大小老鼠。
