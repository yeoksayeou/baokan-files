    Water Turbine Pump That Doesn't Need Supervision
    A new type of water turbine pump that doesn't require fuel or supervision has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Joint State-Private Boshan Machinery Repair Factory.

    A 14-horsepower water turbine pump is placed in water one meter deep. As long as water can flow out of the tail water pipe under the pump, the pump will rotate automatically, supplying 108 tons of water per hour. This type of pump can be installed in general reservoirs, ponds, rivers, or canals. (Xinhua News Agency)

    不用人管的水轮泵
    一种不用燃料和不用人看管的新型水轮泵，最近在公私合营博山机械制修厂试制成功。
    一台十四马力的水轮泵安置在一公尺深的水中，只要水能从泵下尾水管内流出，泵即自行转动，每小时给水一百零八吨。这种泵一般水库、塘坝、河流或水渠都可以安设。　（新华社）
