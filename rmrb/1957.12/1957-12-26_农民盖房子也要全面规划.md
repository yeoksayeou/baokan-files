    Farmers Should Also Have Comprehensive Planning When Building Houses

    In recent years, due to the improvement of farmers' living standards, more people are building new houses. According to incomplete statistics from Wushijiazi Village in Pingquan County, Hebei Province, in 1957 alone, more than 20 households built more than 80 rooms, and more than 10 households have already erected the frames and laid the foundations, ready to build. Most of these houses are brick and tile houses. However, judging from the housing construction situation in this village, there are still some issues worth noting.

    First, villagers are building houses away from their original house sites and occupying the best flat land. Why don't villagers build houses on their original sites? The reason is that the cooperative allows the construction of three rooms, occupying about half a mu of land without compensation, and this land is not counted as part of the private plot. Meng Changqing, a member of the Qian Gouzi Village (mountain gully) cooperative in this township, also left his original mountain gully and went to Wushijiazi Village to build three rooms. As a result, the arable flat land in Wushijiazi Village was occupied by many houses. The villagers have many complaints, especially the villagers in the mountain gullies. For example, when the 12th and 13th teams of this township discussed the great leap forward in production, some villagers said: Large areas of flat land have been built with houses, and ten mu of mountain gully land is not as good as one mu of flat land. If we continue to build like this, how can we produce more grain?

    Second, some villagers are building houses not because they have genuine savings, but by borrowing from all sides. For example, Zhang Fengming and several other households in this cooperative did not have any money themselves, but they built three rooms this summer. They believe that building a house is equivalent to earning it themselves, and they will receive 450 jin of grain in the autumn anyway. This year, he worked more than 2,000 work points, but they were all deducted in the autumn, and he did not receive a single grain, and as a result, he relied on state relief grain.

    With the great leap forward in agricultural production and the improvement of farmers' lives, more villagers will certainly build houses. Therefore, I suggest that local Party committees, especially township Party committees, must make comprehensive plans and unified arrangements for farmers' housing construction in the future to avoid confusion and various losses.

### 农民盖房子也要全面规划

    农民盖房子也要全面规划
    近几年来，由于农民生活水平提高了，盖新房子的人也多起来了。据河北平泉县五十家子村的不完全统计，仅1957年就有二十多户盖了八十多间房子，已经立好房架和打好地基准备盖的还有十多户。这些房子大部都是砖瓦房。但是从这个村盖房子的情况来看，还有一些问题是值得注意的。
    一、社员盖房子都是离开了自己原来的房基地，而占用了最好的大片平川地。为甚么社员不在自己原有基地上盖房子呢？原因是社里允许盖三间房子可以无代价的占用大约半亩左右的土地，这些土地又不算在自留地内。这个乡的乾沟子村（山沟）社员孟长清，也离开了原来的山沟，跑到五十家子村盖了三间房子。就这样五十家子村的可耕平原地，盖房子就占了许多。社员意见很大，特别是山沟里的社员意见更多。如这个乡十二、十三队讨论生产大跃进时，有的社员说：大片平川地都盖上了房子，山沟地十亩也顶不上那一亩，这样盖下去还多打啥粮食啊。
    二、有部分社员盖房子不是真正有了积蓄的，而是东拉西借盖上的。如这个社的张凤鸣等几户，本来自己没有钱，而在今年夏天却盖了三间房子。他们认为：盖上房子就是自己赚下的，反正到秋后得给我四百五十斤粮食吃。他今年劳动了两千多分，秋后都扣光了，连一粒粮食也没分着，结果靠着吃国家的救济粮。
    随着农业生产的大跃进和农民生活的提高，盖房子的社员必定会更多起来。所以，我建议各地党委，特别是乡党委对今后农民盖房子的事一定要作到全面规划，统一安排，以免造成混乱和各种损失。
