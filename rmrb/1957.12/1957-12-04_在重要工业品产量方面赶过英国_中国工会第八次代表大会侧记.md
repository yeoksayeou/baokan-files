　　Overtaking Britain in the Production of Important Industrial Goods
　　——A Sideline Report from the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions
    By our own reporter

    When the first day of the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions concluded, the night was already deep, and the cold air was biting. However, every delegate returned to their lodging with unparalleled excitement and enthusiasm. It was a sleepless night for many; they couldn't forget the day's meeting, talking until dawn. The group meetings on the 3rd were even more fervent, with delegates expressing their determination to respond to the Party's call and strive to catch up with or surpass Britain in the production of steel and other important industrial goods within fifteen years.
      Chairman Mao Encouraged Everyone
    The delegates were most excited about attending the meeting with Chairman Mao. Despite the brevity of the time, the cheers of "Long Live" and the storm-like applause, the image of the great and amiable leader, and the Party's call that shook the world, were deeply imprinted in the minds of the delegates.
    Lin Xingming, a worker representative from Shanghai, kept in mind the factory workers' instructions: If you see Chairman Mao, write a letter back immediately. The night before, he didn't even bother to eat, rushing to write and mail the letter. Lin Xingming's Shanghai Public Utility Machine Factory is a small factory with just over a hundred workers, and he came to Beijing with the extremely excited feelings of all the workers in this small factory. The workers of the Shanghai Public Utility Machine Factory thought: Such a small factory as ours actually has a representative attending a meeting in Beijing, and even possibly seeing Chairman Mao. What an honor! They jumped and laughed, seeing Lin Xingming off outside the factory gate, more lively than welcoming a groom to meet his bride. In his letter to the factory workers, Lin Xingming told everyone that he had seen Chairman Mao and heard the call issued by the Party Central Committee to the entire working class and the people of the whole country. He asked all the employees of the factory to quickly discuss the production tasks in accordance with the call of the Party Central Committee. The letter repeatedly urged: Not only must we complete this year's various production targets, but we must also make all preparations for next year's new products.
    Cao Guifang, the trade union representative from the Northwest Cotton Textile Factory No. 1, has been participating in this conference with excitement and enthusiasm. On the way to Beijing, she was full of hope that she could see Chairman Mao again. She told reporters: Last time, after attending the conference of trade union activists, many workers in Xi'an asked her about Chairman Mao's situation - what clothes he wore, what hat he wore, whether he was fatter or thinner than before, and so on. The workers care for the leader so fervently, how can I as a worker representative fail to live up to everyone's wishes? On the opening day, her bright eyes were fixed on Chairman Mao. As she watched and thought, what can she report to him? People all know that Cao Guifang's team is a model textile industrial team rare in the country. From 1952 to the present, this team has increased the production of cotton yarn by 127,243 pieces for the country. However, Cao Guifang always feels that it is not enough, secretly assuring Chairman Mao in her heart that she must strive to improve technology to make the advanced level even more advanced.
        The Determination of Steelworkers
    The meeting of the Party and state leaders with the delegates encouraged everyone. The Party Central Committee's call to catch up with or surpass Britain in the production of steel and other important industrial products after fifteen years pointed out the goal for everyone's struggle. Delegates from Anshan, the steel capital, unanimously stated that they have the determination and confidence to realize this call put forward by the Party Central Committee.
    Zhou Chuandian, Deputy Director and Engineer of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' Iron Smelting Plant, introduced the situation of the British steel industry at the group meeting. He said: "In 1956, Britain's steel production was 20,659,000 tons, and iron production was 16,500,800 tons. It is estimated that the British steel industry will develop somewhat in fifteen years, but the capitalist system determines that this development will inevitably be very slow. Take 1956 as an example! This was a relatively fast year for the development of the British steel industry in recent times, but it only increased by 559,000 tons of steel compared to 1955. Judging from the development speed of the steel industry during our country's First Five-Year Plan, it is much faster than that of Britain. It is entirely possible to catch up with Britain in terms of output in fifteen years. Moreover, in fact, some of our steel industry's production technology indicators are already far ahead of Britain and even the United States. For example, the blast furnace utilization coefficient has recently reached 0.686. This means that every 0.686 cubic meters of blast furnace volume can produce one ton of iron. In the past, Britain's blast furnace utilization coefficient was around one cubic meter, and the United States was around 0.8 cubic meters. The construction speed of our country's blast furnaces is also amazing. When the construction project of Anshan Iron and Steel began, it took more than a year to rebuild a blast furnace, then it was shortened to one year, then to more than half a year, and then to half a year. Not long ago, it took only 53 days to completely dismantle an old blast furnace and install a new one. Such a fast construction speed is also unimaginable in capitalist countries."
    Lang Yunzhi, an excavator operator of the Civil Engineering Company of Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company, one of the first pioneers in the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, said at the group meeting that as a member of the construction of the steel base, he would do his part to catch up with Britain. This excavator operator has always been a man of his word. His team has overfulfilled its tasks every year, and the total amount of earth excavated over the years has reached 630,000 cubic meters. He has guided nearly one hundred apprentices before and after, and he has personally taught twenty-two apprentices. The famous advanced producers, excavator operators Jia Jiqing and Cheng Chuanhai, are two of them. This energetic old excavator operator will certainly be able to contribute more to the struggle to catch up with Britain.
        The Wishes of Shanghai Workers
    Not only steelworker representatives, not only representatives from Anshan, but representatives from various industries and regions have expressed their determination to realize the Party's call.
    Shanghai, this world-famous city, was once a colony of imperialism for a long time. On Nanjing Road, on the banks of the Huangpu River, signs filled with various foreign languages hung in the air; on the ground, foreign police officers swaggered around with batons. They insulted China and sucked the blood and sweat of the Chinese working people. Now, this city, returned to the hands of the people, is busy day and night for the construction of the motherland. Catching up with Britain, catching up with the old-fashioned imperialism that once ravaged this city, is a particularly inspiring battle cry for the workers of Shanghai.
    When we visited Ying Zhongzhuang, a fitter at the state-owned Shanghai Textile Machinery Factory, he repeatedly said: "I am one hundred percent in favor of catching up with Britain in fifteen years, and I believe that all the employees in Shanghai will also be one hundred percent in favor. I have been working in Shanghai since I was thirteen years old, and I have suffered enough from imperialism. After liberation, I breathed a sigh of relief, but this breath has not yet been fully exhaled. Now that the Party has put forward this call, I want to devote all my strength to respond to the Party's call." Since 1953, Ying Zhongzhuang has been elected as a model worker for four consecutive years. The three sets of molds he improved alone have increased work efficiency by three and a half times, some by four times, and the highest by sixteen times. Now, he is cooperating with other employees in the factory to trial-produce new products, including ginning machines needed to increase cotton production, fine wool weaving machines, twisting machines, and plying machines. Some of these machines have not yet been officially produced, but have been successfully trial-produced and have begun to be transferred to production; some can also be successively produced next year.
Work better, transform ourselves better

    Realizing this great call of the Party is an arduous task. The delegates all expressed that they must conscientiously implement the Party's various policies and guidelines, work better, and transform themselves better.
    Zou Chengzhu, an engineer at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, expressed that he must adhere to the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily. He said: "Most of the equipment of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company now is old equipment from Hanyeping Company. After liberation, there was no increase in equipment, but production has developed dozens of times. Compared with the first year of liberation, the output has increased by more than twenty-four times. In the second five-year plan, as long as it is slightly expanded, the output can reach more than three times the current output. Not long ago, we conducted an appraisal of these old equipment and found that most of them can still be used for twenty years. This shows that some old things can still play a great role as long as they are properly utilized."
    Many delegates talked about the working class taking a model role in self-education and self-transformation, and training the working class into a conscious, organized, disciplined, culturally and technically stronger fighting force. Zhang Zhongqiu, deputy captain of the Tianjin Mechanical Engineering Team, said that some new workers there think they are great after only working for three or four years. They don’t study their work diligently and only think about what to eat and wear. When the old workers teach them, they say: "Who told you to come early? We live in the Mao Zedong era." Zhang Zhongqiu said that it is necessary to strengthen the education of these new workers and improve their awareness. Some new intellectuals, staff and technical personnel representatives also expressed that they must carry out self-transformation. Zhang Peiyan, a representative from Gansu and a professor at Lanzhou Medical College, immediately wrote a letter back after listening to the congratulatory speech made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, requesting to go to the countryside to work and train himself to become an intellectual of the working class.

　　在重要工业品产量方面赶过英国
　　——中国工会第八次代表大会侧记
    本报记者
    中国工会第八次全国代表大会第一天的会议结束时，已经夜色深沉、寒气逼人了。但每一个代表都怀着无比兴奋、无比热烈的心情回到旅舍。这一晚，是一个难眠的夜晚，许多代表忘不了白天的会议，他们交谈到东方发亮。3日的小组会更是开得热烈，发言的代表都表示决心，一定要响应党的号召，争取十五年后，在钢铁和其他重要工业品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国。
      毛主席鼓舞了大家
    代表们最兴奋的，是同毛主席在一起开会。尽管时间那么短，那一片欢呼“万岁”的声浪和暴风雨般的掌声，那伟大而和蔼的领袖形象，那震动全世界的党的号召，却深深地烙印在代表们的脑子里。
    来自上海的工人代表林醒明，一直惦念着厂里工人们的嘱咐：如果看到毛主席，马上写封信回去。前天晚上，他顾不得吃饭，赶忙写了信寄出去。林醒明所在的上海公用机器厂是一个只有一百多工人的小厂，他是带着这个小厂全体工人万分激动的心情来到北京的。上海公用机器厂的工人们这样想：像我们这样的小厂，居然有个代表到北京开会，而且还可能见到毛主席，这是多么大的光荣！他们跳着、笑着，一直把林醒明送到厂门外，比欢送新郎去迎亲还要热闹。林醒明在给厂里工人的信上告诉大家，他见到了毛主席，听到了党中央向全体工人阶级和全国人民发出的号召，他要求全厂职工根据党中央的号召，赶快讨论一下生产任务。信上再三叮嘱：不仅要完成今年的各项生产指标，而且要为明年的新产品做好各项准备。
    西北棉纺一厂的工会代表曹桂芳，一直以兴奋激动的心情参加这个大会。来北京的途程中，她就满心希望能够再次看到毛主席。她告诉记者：上次，出席工会积极分子大会以后，回到西安，许多工人向她问起毛主席的情况，穿什么衣服，戴什么帽子？比过去胖了还是瘦了？等等。工人们这样热忱地关怀领袖，作为工人代表怎能辜负大家的愿望呢？开幕的那天，她的一双晶莹的眼睛一直盯视在毛主席身上，她看着想着，拿什么来向他老人家报告呢？人们都知道曹桂芳所在的小组是全国少有的纺织工业模范小组，这个小组从1952年到现在已经给国家增产棉纱十二万七千二百四十三件，然而，曹桂芳总觉得做得不够，心里暗暗地向毛主席保证：一定要努力提高技术，使先进的水平更加先进。
        钢铁工人的决心
    党和国家的领导人员同代表们的会见，鼓舞了大家，党中央提出的十五年后在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面，赶上或者超过英国的号召，给大家指出了奋斗的目标。来自钢都鞍山的代表，一致表示他们有决心、有信心来实现党中央所提出的这个号召。
    鞍钢炼铁厂副厂长、工程师周传典在小组会上介绍了英国钢铁工业的情况。他说：“1956年，英国的钢产量是二千零六十五万九千吨，铁的产量是一千六百五十万零八千吨。估计十五年后英国钢铁工业还会有些发展，但资本主义制度决定了这种发展必然是很慢的。拿1956年来说吧！这是近来英国钢铁工业发展较快的一年，但也只比1955年增加了五十五万九千吨钢。从我国第一个五年计划期间钢铁工业的发展速度来看，要比英国快得多，十五年后，在产量上赶上英国是完全可能的。而且事实上，我国有些钢铁工业的生产技术指标，已经远远地走在英国、甚至走在美国的前面。例如高炉利用系数，最近一个时期已经达到0.686。这就是说，每0.686立方公尺的高炉容积就可以炼出一吨铁来。而英国过去一个时期的高炉利用系数在一立方公尺左右，美国也在0.8立方公尺左右。我国高炉的建设速度也是惊人的。鞍钢的建设工程刚开始的时候，改建一座高炉要一年多时间，后来缩短为一年，再后来缩短为半年多，再后来又缩短为半年；不久以前，只花了五十三天的时间，就把一座旧高炉全部拆除，安上一座新高炉。这样快的建设速度，也是资本主义国家不可想像的。”
    鞍钢建设工程的第一批开路先锋中的一员、鞍钢建设公司土建公司的挖土机手郎运治在小组会上表示，作为建设钢铁基地的一个成员，他要为赶上英国出一份力。这位挖土机手从来是言出必行的。他所在的机组年年超额完成任务，历年挖的土，总计已达六十三万公方。受过他指导的徒弟，前后将近一百人，他把着手教出来的徒弟也有二十二个。著名的先进生产者、挖土机手贾吉庆和程川海就是其中的两个。这位精力旺盛的老挖土机手一定能在赶上英国的斗争中贡献出更大的力量。
        上海工人的心愿
    不只是钢铁工人的代表，不只是来自鞍山的代表，各个产业的、各个地区的代表都表示了实现党的号召的决心。
    上海，这个世界著名的城市，曾经长期是帝国主义的殖民地。在南京路，在黄埔江边，腾空挂起的是写满了各种外国文字的招牌；地面上，外国警察拿着棍棒，到处耀武扬威。他们侮辱了中国，吸吮中国劳动人民的血汗。现在，这座回到人民手中的城市，正为祖国的建设日夜繁忙。赶上英国，赶上曾经宰割过这个城市的老牌帝国主义，对上海工人说来，是一个特别鼓舞人心的战斗口号。
    当我们访问国营上海纺织机械厂钳工应忠庄的时候，他一再说：“在十五年后赶上英国，我是一百个赞成，相信上海的全体职工，也会是一百个赞成的。我十三岁就在上海做工，受帝国主义的气受够了。解放以后，是吐了一口气，但是这口气还没有吐尽，现在党提出了这个号召，我要拿出我的全部力量来响应党的号召。”应忠庄从1953年起，连续四年当选为劳动模范。光是他改进的三件模具，有的把工作效率提高了三倍半，有的提到四倍，最高的提高到十六倍。现在，他正在和厂子里的其他职工，合作试制新产品，这中间有为增产棉花所需要的剥绒机，有细毛纺织机、拈丝机、拼丝机，这些机器有的虽然还没有正式生产，但已经试制成功，开始移交生产；有的在明年也可以相继出厂。更好地工作，更好地改造自己
    实现党的这个伟大的号召，是一个艰巨的任务。代表们都表示一定要认真贯彻党的各项方针政策，更好地工作，更好地改造自己。
    重庆钢铁公司工程师邹承祖表示一定要坚持勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业的方针。他说：“重庆钢铁公司现在的设备大部是汉冶萍公司的旧设备，解放以后，没有增加什么，可是生产却几十倍地向前发展着。同解放的第一年相比，产量已经增加了二十四倍以上；在第二个五年计划里，只要稍稍扩建一下，产量就可以达到现在产量的三倍多。不久以前，我们曾对这些旧设备作了一次鉴定，发现大部分还可以使用二十年。这说明有些旧的东西，只要好好利用起来，仍然能发挥很大的作用。”
    许多代表都谈到工人阶级要在自我教育、自我改造方面起模范作用，把工人阶级的队伍锻炼成一支有觉悟，有组织，有纪律，有文化技术的、更加坚强的战斗队伍。天津机械工程队副队长张忠秋说，他们那里有些新工人才干了三、四年就以为了不起了，工作不钻研，尽想吃的穿的，老工人教训他们，还说：“谁叫你来早了，我们是生活在毛泽东时代”。张忠秋说，必须加强对这些新工人的教育，提高他们的觉悟。一些新知识分子、职员和技术人员的代表，也表示一定要进行自我改造。甘肃的代表、兰州医学院教授张培焰听了刘少奇同志代表中共中央所作的祝词，立即写了信回去，要求下乡劳动，把自己锻炼成为一个工人阶级的知识分子。
