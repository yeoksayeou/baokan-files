Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Reporter Mào Fújūn reports: A massive upsurge in water conservancy construction has formed throughout Anhui province. According to statistics up to December 6th, ten million farmers in the province have participated in water conservancy construction, completing 260 million cubic meters of earth and stone work.

The characteristics of Anhui's water conservancy construction this year are: early start (about twenty days earlier than in previous years), great enthusiasm, large number of people, and fast progress. The enthusiasm of farmers for water conservancy construction is unprecedented. For example, in Feidong County and Funan County, which started early and made rapid progress, each county had about 300,000 people participating in water conservancy construction, accounting for more than 70% of the county's total able-bodied labor force. Now these two counties have completed the water conservancy tasks expected to be completed this winter ahead of schedule and have begun to continue the projects originally planned to be done next spring. Xiao County recently proposed striving to complete the entire water conservancy tasks for this winter and next spring this winter. In the past month, water conservancy projects across the province have totaled more than 120 million workdays, with an average of about two cubic meters per person per day.

At present, the upsurge of water conservancy construction in Anhui Province is further developing in depth. All localities are carrying out labor competitions and taking measures to improve work and ensure project quality. All counties have sent cadres to conduct in-depth inspections of project quality. Some counties, due to the implementation of contract methods such as contracting tasks, contracting work points, contracting time, and contracting quality, not only ensured project quality but also improved work efficiency. The next month or so will be the most intense sprint stage, and the province requires completing more than 60% of the tasks for this winter and next spring this winter. Judging from the current progress of the movement, it is possible to exceed the province's requirement of doing one hundred workdays and completing 800 million cubic meters of earth and stone work this winter and next spring.

Achievements of the Past Eight Years

The achievements of Anhui Province's water conservancy cause in the past eight years have been enormous. In addition to the projects for harnessing the Huai River, repairing dikes, dredging rivers, and building reservoirs and sluices, the earth and stone work done for the Yangtze River embankment consolidation and farmland water conservancy projects alone reached 1.47 billion cubic meters. The Yangtze River's main dikes, stretching more than 600 kilometers, and the inland river embankments, stretching more than 9,000 kilometers, have generally been rebuilt and repaired. In mountainous and hilly areas, the province not only fully restored the dilapidated 880,000 ponds and dams that existed before liberation but also newly opened and built 240,000 ponds and dams, constructed more than 60,000 mu of terraced fields, and built 440 small and medium-sized reservoirs. In plain areas, 24,000 large and medium-sized ditches, more than 70,000 small ditches, 502 enclosed areas, and 120,000 brick and bamboo wells were dug. Thirty-five medium-sized irrigation projects and twenty-seven pumping stations (with a total of 1,024 pumps and 29,653 horsepower) were built throughout the province. Because of these projects, the Yangtze River's main dikes can now guarantee that they will not collapse even when encountering the highest flood levels of 1954. Of the province's original 24.86 million mu of paddy fields, except for 2 million mu with relatively poor irrigation conditions, the rest have basically been equipped with irrigation facilities. In addition, 6.16 million mu of paddy fields and 5 million mu of irrigated land have been expanded. The province's irrigated area has reached 36 million mu. Of the 30 million mu of easily flooded cultivated land in northern Anhui, 15 million mu will not suffer from waterlogging even under continuous rainfall of 300 mm for nine days. Soil and water conservation in mountainous areas has also initially controlled 3,429 square kilometers. In general, Anhui Province currently has 50% of its farmland that can be protected from harvests in years of ordinary drought and flood disasters, and the rest can also reduce the extent of the disaster. The past situation of "heavy rain, heavy disaster; light rain, light disaster; no rain, drought disaster" has been basically changed.

Relying on the Masses, Focusing on Small-Scale Projects

In the construction of farmland water conservancy projects, Anhui Province resolutely implemented the policy of focusing on small and medium-sized water conservancy projects, constantly criticized the ideological deviations of some cadres who blindly pursued large projects, did not pay attention to project benefits, and completely relied on national assistance. The characteristics of many farmland water conservancy projects done in recent years are small investment, large number, wide distribution, quick results, and great benefits, and they are basically self-managed by the masses.

The enclosure of areas in northern Anhui only started in 1954, and now 502 enclosures have been completed. After the enclosure, not only was waterlogging prevented, but also conditions were provided for converting to rice cultivation. This year, more than one million mu of rice were converted to rice cultivation in northern Anhui. Generally, each mu of rice field yields 300 to 400 jin, and the highest yields are more than 1,000 jin per mu.

Digging ponds to store water is a pioneering initiative in the North Anhui Plain, and the local area has received great benefits. The Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Guoyang County dug a large pond covering seventeen acres, which can irrigate 630 acres of land. This year, 82 acres of rice were converted for the first time, and the yield per mu increased by 260 jin compared with the surrounding dryland crops.

Before liberation, Anhui Province's water conservancy facilities were shockingly dilapidated and disorganized. The ability to prevent floods, waterlogging, and drought was very low. Especially in the Huaibei area, after the Yellow River seized the Huai River, the water system was disordered, and the dikes were weak, forming a situation of "heavy rain, heavy disaster; light rain, light disaster; no rain, drought disaster." Almost every two years, there was a severe drought or flood disaster, and the affected area often reached 20 to 30 million mu.

After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the masses were actively mobilized to carry out the farmland water conservancy movement. In the past eight years, from tens of thousands to two to three million people have participated in water conservancy construction every winter and spring, working for about one hundred days each year. After cooperativization, in the spring of 1956, the number of farmers participating in water conservancy construction surged to 6.57 million, and the mobilization of labor reached about 50% of the total number of able-bodied laborers.

Basic Elimination of Water and Drought Disasters Within Ten Years

Anhui Province's water conservancy construction in the past eight years is only the first step in completely changing the disaster-prone face of the province. Larger-scale water conservancy construction is still in the next ten years. The plan for water conservancy construction in 1958 and the plan for the next ten years have been drawn up. In the next ten years, Anhui Province will build various water conservancy projects according to the characteristics of various regions such as mountainous areas, the Yangtze River polder area, hilly areas, and the Huaibei plain. In Huaibei, the main tasks are to continue digging ditches, enclosing areas, digging ponds, dredging rivers, digging wells, and building sluices. In the hilly areas between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, we will continue to repair ponds and dams, block and build dams to control torrents, build small reservoirs, and build pumping stations. In the Yangtze River polder area, the main tasks are to thicken the inner embankments, dredge ditches and ponds, maintain the Yangtze River dikes, repair culverts and sluices, and build pumping stations. In mountainous areas, the main tasks are to open terraced fields, build valley dikes, and control mountain gullies. Completing these water conservancy projects, Anhui Province will further change its historical disaster-prone appearance and create a completely new situation: southern Anhui will catch up with Lingnan; northern Anhui will become like southern Anhui; dry land will become paddy fields; and low yields will become high yields. By that time, flood disasters like the one in 1954, waterlogging disasters like the one in 1956, and drought disasters like the one in 1953 will be basically eliminated. By that time, Anhui Province's irrigated area will expand from the current 36 million mu to 85 million mu, the province's paddy fields will expand from the current 31 million mu to 50 million mu, and the irrigated land will expand from 5 million mu to 35 million mu. The province's soil erosion area of 22,000 square kilometers will also be completely controlled. (Attached picture)

    动工早　劲头足　声势大　进度快
    安徽千多万人兴修水利
    新华社专讯　记者冒茀君报道：声势浩大的兴修水利的高潮已在安徽全省范围内形成。到12月6日的统计，全省参加兴修水利的农民已有一千万人，已完成土石方二亿六千万公方。
    安徽今年兴修水利的特点是：动工早（较往年提早二十天左右）、劲头大、人数多、进度快。农民兴修水利的积极性是空前未有的。如动工早、进度快的肥东县、阜南县每个县参加兴修水利的都有三十万人左右，占全县整半劳动力70％以上。现在这两个县已提前完成了预计今冬要完成的水利任务，开始继续做原订明年春天准备做的工程。萧县最近已提出争取在今冬完成今冬明春整个的水利任务。全省一个月来水利工程已共计做了一亿二千多万个工作日，平均每人每天约做两公方左右。
    目前，安徽省兴修水利的高潮正在进一步深入发展。各地都正在开展劳动竞赛，并采取措施提高工作，保证工程质量。各县都派出干部深入检查工程质量。有些县由于采取了包任务、包工分、包时间、包质量等包工办法，不仅保证了工程质量，而且提高了工作效率。今后一个多月，将是最紧张的突击阶段，全省要求在今年冬天完成今冬明春任务的60％以上。从现在运动进展的情况看，全省要求今冬明春做一百个工作日、完成土石方八亿公方的任务是可能超过的。
    八年来的成绩
    八年来，安徽省水利事业获得的成就是巨大的。除去治理淮河、整修堤防、疏浚河道、建造水库和水闸方面的工程以外，仅仅长江整堤和农田水利工程做的土石方，即达十四亿七千万公方。长达六百多公里的长江干堤和长达九千多公里的内河圩堤，一般都进行了改建和整修。在山区和丘陵地区，全省不仅全部恢复了解放前破破烂烂的八十八万处塘坝，还新开新建塘坝二十四万处，兴修梯田六万多亩，兴建中小水库四百四十座。在平原地区，开挖大、中沟二万四千条，小沟七万多条，圈圩五百零二处，打砖井、竹井十二万眼。全省兴建中型灌溉工程三十五处、抽水机站二十七处（共有抽水机一千零二十四台，二万九千六百五十三匹马力）。由于做了这些工程，长江干堤已可以保证遇到1954年最高的洪水位不溃破。全省原有二千四百八十六万亩水稻田，除二百万亩灌溉条件较差以外，其余已基本上有了灌溉设施，另外并且扩大了六百一十六万亩水稻田，五百万亩水浇地。全省的灌溉面积已达到三千六百万亩。淮北三千万亩易涝的耕地，目前已有一千五百万亩在连续九天降雨三百公厘的情况下不会发生涝灾。山区水土保持也已初步控制三千四百二十九平方公里。总的说，安徽省目前在普通水旱灾害的年景下，已有50％的农田可以保收，其余的也可以减轻受灾的程度。过去的“大雨大灾、小雨小灾，无雨旱灾”的局面已基本上改变过来。
    依靠群众　小型为主
    安徽省在兴修农田水利工程中，坚决贯彻了以中小型水利工程为主的方针，不断地批判了某些干部盲目求大、不重视工程效益和完全依赖国家帮助等思想偏向。几年来所做的很多农田水利工程的特点是投资小，数量多，分布广，收效快，收效大，基本上都是由群众自办的。
    淮北圈圩是从1954年才开始的，现在已经圈了五百零二处圩。圈圩之后，不仅防治了内涝，而且为改种水稻提供了条件。今年淮北改种的水稻一百多万亩，一般稻田每亩都收三、四百斤，最多的每亩收一千斤以上。
    挖塘蓄水，在淮北平原是个创举，当地受到很大效益。涡阳县曙光农业社挖了一口占地十七亩的大塘，可浇地六百三十亩。今年第一次改种八十二亩水稻，每亩产量比周围旱粮作物增产二百六十斤。
    安徽省在解放以前水利设备的破烂和紊乱是非常惊人的。不论是防洪、防涝、防旱的能力都非常低。特别是淮北地区在黄河夺淮以后，水系紊乱，堤防薄弱，形成了“大雨大灾、小雨小灾、无雨旱灾”的局面，几乎每两年就有一次严重的旱涝灾害，受灾的面积经常有二、三千万亩。
    解放以后，在党和政府的领导下，积极发动群众开展农田水利运动。八年来，每年冬季和春季参加兴修水利的都达到几十万人到二、三百万人，每年约做一百天左右。合作化以后，1956年春天参加兴修水利的农民激增到六百五十七万人，劳动力的动员面达到整半劳动力总数的50％左右。
    十年内基本消灭水旱灾害
    安徽省八年来的兴修水利，还不过是彻底改变多灾面貌的第一步。更大规模地兴修水利，还在今后十年。1958年度兴修水利的计划和今后十年的规划已拟出。今后十年，安徽省将按照山区、长江圩区、丘陵地区、淮北平原等各种不同地区的特点，兴建各种水利工程。在淮北，主要是继续开沟、圈圩、挖塘、疏浚河道、打井、建水闸；在江淮之间的丘陵地区，将继续整修塘坝，拦冲打坝，兴建小型水库、兴建抽水机站；在长江圩区，主要是培厚内埂、疏浚沟塘、养护江堤、整修涵闸、兴建抽水机站；在山区，主要是开梯田、做谷坊、闸山沟。完成这些水利工程。安徽省将进一步改变历史上多灾的面貌，出现一个全新的局面：江南，将赶上岭南；淮北，将变成江南；旱地将变成水田；低产将变成高产。到那个时候，1954年那样的洪水灾害，1956年那样的内涝灾害，1953年那样的旱灾，都将基本消除。到那个时候，安徽省灌溉面积将由现在的三千六百万亩扩大到八千五百万亩，全省稻田将由现在的三千一百万亩扩大到五千万亩，水浇地将由五百万亩扩大到三千五百万亩。全省水土流失面积二万二千平方公里也将全部控制起来。（附图片）
