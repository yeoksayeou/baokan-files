Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th - As the American ruling group intensifies its efforts to create a so-called "Two Chinas" scheme in an attempt to permanently occupy China's territory of Taiwan, U.S. Democratic Senator Morse openly clamored in Tokyo on the 27th to have Taiwan "placed under United Nations trusteeship," and to have it managed by a police force "until the International Court of Justice can resolve the issue of the island's sovereignty." He said, "We must exercise police power over Taiwan until it achieves stability."

Morse arrived in Tokyo on the 26th after attending the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference in India. Morse then presented his absurd proposal for Taiwan on the 27th during a "Meet the Press" radio program held at the "Tokyo Press Club."

Morse repeatedly stated that he was opposed to recognizing China. The "reasons" he cited were that China "has not been able to demonstrate that it is capable of fulfilling its international obligations" and "has repeatedly violated the Korean Armistice Agreement." Morse's shameless slander against China is not worth refuting, because it is the U.S. government that has refused to fulfill its international obligations and has repeatedly violated the Korean Armistice Agreement.

### 美国参议员莫尔斯痴人梦呓  公然叫嚷要联合国“托管”台湾

    美国参议员莫尔斯痴人梦呓
    公然叫嚷要联合国“托管”台湾
    据新华社28日讯　东京消息：在美国统治集团加紧制造所谓“两个中国”的阴谋以图永久霸占中国的领土台湾的时候，美国民主党参议员莫尔斯27日在东京竟然公开叫嚷要把台湾“交付联合国托管”，并且在“国际法院未能解决该岛的主权问题以前由一支警察部队来管理”。他说，“在获得稳定局面以前，我们要对台湾施行警察权力。”
    莫尔斯是在印度参加了英联邦议员会议以后在26日到达东京的。莫尔斯接着在27日在“东京记者俱乐部”举行的“同新闻界见面”的广播节目中提出他的对台湾的荒谬主张。
    莫尔斯还一再说明他是反对承认中国的。他所列举的“理由”是中国“没有能够表明它是能够履行自己的国际义务”，“一再地违反朝鲜停战协定”。莫尔斯这种对中国的无耻诬蔑是不值一驳的，因为拒绝履行国际义务和一再违反朝鲜停战协定的，正是美国政府。
