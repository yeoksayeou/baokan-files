    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:
    The Qianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Shehong County, Sichuan Province, achieved an average yield of 100 jin per mu on its more than 2,460 mu of cotton fields this year. Among them, over 360 mu reached 120 to 185.5 jin respectively.

    The Qianfeng Cooperative is located in the hilly red sandstone and shale area, with most of the soil being barren and prone to autumn rains. However, due to their creation of the "square grid seedling cultivation method" and the implementation of many technological reforms, the cooperative had already reached an average cotton field yield of 70 jin per mu last year. This year's average yield is more than 66% higher than the highest level of local well-to-do middle peasants.

    在瘠薄的土地上
　  棉花大面积丰产
    据新华社讯　四川省射洪县有一个前锋农业社，今年全社二千四百六十多亩棉田平均产量达到一百斤，其中有三百六十多亩分别达到一百二十到一百八十五斤半。
    前锋社地处丘陵区红砂页岩地带，大部土质瘠薄，秋季又多雨。但是由于他们创造了“方格育苗法”和实行了许多技术上的改革，这个社去年就已达到棉田平均亩产七十斤的水平。今年平均亩产更比当地富裕中农最高水平高出66％多。
