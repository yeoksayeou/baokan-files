To strive for the early restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan is a matter of concern to the people of both countries for several years, and it is also the goal of their concerted efforts. The Japanese Socialist Party Goodwill Mission to China, the Japanese National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Relations Delegation to China, and the Japan-China Friendship Association Delegation to China, which visited our country this year, all expressed their desire to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations in the joint statements issued with relevant Chinese organizations, and condemned the conspiracy to create "Two Chinas." Recently, the Japanese Socialist Party sent another goodwill mission to visit our country; and in Tokyo, people from various groups who had visited our country have formed the Tokyo Round-Table Conference of Visitors to China, which aims to promote the movement to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. We believe that, based on the common position repeatedly stated by the people of both countries, the efforts made by Japanese friends to realize the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations will produce beneficial results.

However, the adverse current hindering the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between China and Japan still stirs up waves in Japan from time to time. The so-called "adjustment" of the "Two Chinas" issue, disseminated by Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi on November 12 in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Councillors, is a recent example. Kishi's argument is not only a blatant interference in China's internal affairs, but also an endorsement of the American conspiracy to divide Chinese territory. During his visit to Southeast Asia and the United States in June this year, Kishi Nobusuke spread a series of slanders against our country. After being refuted by our Premier Zhou Enlai with righteous and stern words, and in the face of strong Japanese public opinion hoping to be friendly to China, he repeatedly defended himself, but here he once again revealed his unfriendly attitude towards the Chinese people.

Kishi Nobusuke said that the tension in the Taiwan Strait "is the result of both the Kuomintang and the Communists claiming sovereignty over mainland China," and "unless their disputes can be adjusted, the tension cannot be eliminated." This is obviously a deliberate confusion of right and wrong. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people overthrew the dark rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, liberated the entire Chinese mainland, and Taiwan is a province of China. There is only the issue of the Chinese people continuing to liberate Taiwan, and there is absolutely no "dispute" over Chinese sovereignty. Liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair and no external forces are allowed to interfere. As for the tension in the Taiwan region, it is entirely the result of the illegal occupation of our territory Taiwan by the United States. This is a matter of Sino-US relations in the Taiwan region. In order to safeguard world peace and ease international tensions, the Chinese government has consistently advocated seeking to eliminate tensions in the Taiwan region through peaceful negotiations with the United States. The United States government has not only rejected China's proposal, but has also continued to intensify its control over Taiwan. This is the root cause of the long-term existence of tension in the Taiwan region. The Sino-US relations issue in the Taiwan region and the internal affairs issue of the Chinese people liberating Taiwan are two completely different issues. Kishi Nobusuke deliberately mixed them together to cover up the US aggression against China, which is obviously not a genuine desire to eliminate tension, but has ulterior motives.

The United States is recently actively planning to create a "Two Chinas" situation, attempting to permanently place Taiwan under its control and get rid of the increasingly isolated predicament it has fallen into in its China policy. Not long ago, the United States openly played the leading role in creating the farce of "Two Chinas" at the 19th International Red Cross Conference.

At this time, Kishi Nobusuke issued such absurd arguments, obviously willing to follow the United States and act as an accomplice in the US conspiracy to create "Two Chinas." Since Kishi Nobusuke and his cabinet came to power, they have been playing the inglorious role of followers of the United States in obstructing the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan, which has increasingly aroused dissatisfaction among the Japanese people. Kishi Nobusuke may have thought that by echoing the tune of "Two Chinas" with the United States, he could both win the favor of the United States and cover up his embarrassing situation in his China policy. However, not only is the Japanese people's desire to be friendly with China and restore diplomatic relations between the two countries as soon as possible strong and universal, but also many Japanese people's organizations with broad representation have repeatedly stated that the movement to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations should not be used by any conspiracy to create "Two Chinas." This solemn position is increasingly supported and endorsed by the broad masses of the Japanese people. Kishi Nobusuke's attempt to use the "Two Chinas" issue to confuse right and wrong and deceive the Japanese people is not only a futile attempt, but will also be condemned and abandoned by the broad masses of the Japanese people who sincerely hope that Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations will be normalized as soon as possible.

The Chinese people will work with the Japanese people to do everything possible to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. It is precisely for this reason that the people of China and Japan must resolutely oppose any attempt to create "Two Chinas" that hinders this effort.

### 反对“两个中国”的任何企图

    反对“两个中国”的任何企图
    争取早日恢复中日邦交，是中日两国人民几年来一直关心的问题，也是两国人民一致努力的目标。今年先后来我国访问的日本社会党访华亲善使节团、日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华使节团、日中友好协会访华代表团在同我国有关团体发表的共同声明中，都表示了促进中日邦交正常化的愿望，并且谴责了企图制造“两个中国”的阴谋。最近，日本社会党又派了亲善使节团来我国访问；在东京的曾经访问过我国的各团体人士已组成了旨在推进恢复日中邦交运动的东京访华人士恳谈会。我们相信，本着两国人民一再表明过的共同立场，日本朋友们为实现中日邦交正常化所作的努力，是会产生有益的结果的。
    但是阻碍中日恢复正常邦交的逆流在日本还时时兴波作浪。日本首相岸信介11月12日在参议院外务委员会上散布的所谓要对“两个中国”问题进行“调整”的论调，就是最近的一个例子。岸信介的这一论调，不仅是对中国内政的公然干涉，也是对于美国企图割裂中国领土的阴谋的附和。岸信介在今年6月访问东南亚和美国期间，曾散布了一系列污蔑我国的言论。在受到我国周恩来总理义正辞严的驳斥之后，在强烈地希望对中国友好的日本社会舆论面前，他曾一再进行辩解，但是在这里他又一次露出了对于中国人民的不友好的态度。
    岸信介说台湾海峡的紧张局势“是国民党人和共产党人都自称对大陆中国据有主权的结果”，“除非能调整他们的争执，否则就不可能消除紧张局势”。这显然是故意混淆是非的胡说。中国人民在共产党的领导之下，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的黑暗统治，解放了整个中国大陆，台湾是中国的一个省份，只存在中国人民继续解放台湾的问题，绝不存在什么关于中国主权的“争执”问题。解放台湾，是中国的内政问题，绝不容许任何外来势力的干涉。至于台湾地区的紧张局势，则完全是由于美国非法侵占我国领土台湾所造成的结果。这是在台湾地区发生的中美关系问题。为了维护世界和平和缓和国际紧张局势，中国政府一直主张和美国通过和平谈判来谋求消除台湾地区的紧张局势。美国政府不仅拒绝了中国的建议，而且不断加紧对台湾的控制。这是台湾地区紧张局势长期存在的根本原因。在台湾地区发生的中美关系问题和中国人民解放台湾的内政问题，是两个性质完全不同的问题，岸信介故意把它们搅在一起，为美国侵略中国行为进行掩护，显然不是真想消除紧张局势，而是别有用心。
    美国最近正在积极策划造成“两个中国”的局面，企图把台湾永久置于它的控制之下，并且摆脱它在对华政策上所陷入的日益孤立的困境。不久前美国在第十九届国际红十字大会上公然扮演了制造“两个中国”丑剧中的主角。
    岸信介在这个时候发出这种荒谬论调，显然甘愿追随美国之后，充当美国制造“两个中国”阴谋的助手。岸信介和他的内阁上台以来，一直充当了美国阻挠中日两国恢复正常关系的追随者的不光荣的角色，这已经愈来愈引起日本人民的不满。岸信介也许以为跟着美国唱唱“两个中国”的调子，既可以博得美国欢心，又可以掩盖自己在对华政策上的狼狈处境。可是，日本人民不仅要求同中国友好、早日恢复两国邦交的愿望是强烈而普遍的，而且具有广泛代表性的许多日本人民团体一再表明了恢复日中邦交运动不应该为任何制造“两个中国”的阴谋所利用。这种严正立场日益得到日本广大人民的支持和赞同。岸信介想利用“两个中国”问题，混淆是非，欺骗日本人民，这不仅是枉费心机，而且一定会受到真诚希望中日邦交早日正常化的日本广大人民的谴责和唾弃。
    中国人民将同日本人民一起，尽一切努力来促进中日关系的正常化。正是因为这个缘故，中日两国人民必须坚决反对妨碍这种努力的关于“两个中国”的任何企图。
