　　Facing New Historical Tasks
    A Sideline Account of the Closing of the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions
　　By Our Staff Reporter

    The Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions has closed. The meeting was filled with prolonged applause. This solemn sound declared to the world: China's working class has victoriously overfulfilled the First Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy, and is now welcoming the Second Five-Year Plan with full confidence, preparing to catch up with and surpass England in the output of steel and important industrial products within fifteen years.

    Catching up with and surpassing England is a new vocabulary that has recently appeared in our lives. However, it is not unfamiliar to us. Such hopes have long been buried in the hearts of each of us. When the Party put forward this great task to the working class and the people of the whole country, the representatives at the meeting, whether it was the Uyghur representative Ayahan, the Mongolian girl Modeg, the Kazakh oil worker Nutu, or the Dai youth Meng Bide who planted coffee, quickly understood the full meaning of this task.

    Catching up with England in fifteen years is such a heroic and magnificent statement! Only a nation full of heroic spirit can set such a goal for itself.

    England, this old-brand capitalist country, although they sowed the seeds of economic prosperity, they also planted the crisis of depression and death, although this is the inevitable result of objective law development, after all, this is a country that has been on the road of modern industry for nearly three hundred years, an imperialist country that has enriched itself by squeezing the marrow and blood of hundreds of millions of colonial people. The fact before us is: they now produce more than 20 million tons of steel and more than 200 million tons of coal annually.

    However, things are changing, and are changing now. The representatives from Anshan, the steel capital, are witnesses to this profound change. Zhou Chuandian, the deputy director of the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant, said: Judging from the speed of development of China's steel industry during the First Five-Year Plan, England will definitely be overtaken by us. Before liberation, the highest annual output of steel in our country was 920,000 tons. It is expected to reach 5.24 million tons this year, an increase of four and a half times. In the eight years since the founding of the country, the growth rate of our steel production has averaged more than 70% per year. In England, it was 7.8 million tons in 1913. After forty-three years, it only increased to 20 million tons in 1956, with an average annual growth rate of less than 4%. The hands of the liberated people are truly miraculous hands!

    Speaking of the speed of industrial development, representatives from any industry attending the conference will tell you a series of solid and powerful figures. The representative of the coal industry said: In 1948, China's annual coal output was only 14 million tons. This year, China's coal output will exceed 120 million tons. Zhang Quanju, a delegate to the conference, is a coal miner from Tongchuan Coal Mine in Shaanxi. He said: Let's talk about the changes in our mine. The coal miners who used to wield hammers and chisels have now become excellent coal cutting machine and combine drivers. The former haulage workers have now become electric drillers, pneumatic drillers, chain conveyor and motor car drivers. The coal output in one month now is equal to the output in one year during the Kuomintang rule. Tongchuan is an ancient mining area, and coal mining began as early as the Song Dynasty. Later, the Kuomintang reactionary government also engaged in it here for more than 30 years. However, they did not even build a small power plant, and coal mining was entirely with hammers and chisels. And we have not only built modern power plants, but also a pair of modern vertical shafts have been built; the Sanlidong vertical shaft alone can produce 600,000 tons of coal a year.

    1958 is coming, and the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan is about to begin. By 1962, we will strive to increase steel production to 12 million tons, coal production to 230 million tons, power generation to 44 billion kilowatt-hours, chemical fertilizers to 7 million tons, and cement production to 12.5 million tons. A magnificent construction blueprint is once again displayed before us. The eight hundred and thirty-one representatives, representing 16 million members across the country, said: Under the leadership of the Party, we must achieve this goal, and we will definitely be able to achieve this goal. We know that there are thousands upon thousands of difficulties on the road ahead. However, we also know that difficulties cannot stop us, and all difficulties will be overcome by the hardworking and brave Chinese working class.

　　在新的历史任务面前
    中国工会第八次代表大会闭幕侧记
　　本报记者
    中国工会第八次全国代表大会闭幕了。会议上响起了持久不息的掌声。这个庄严的声音向全世界宣告：我国的工人阶级，已经胜利地超额完成了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，现在正满怀着信心迎接第二个五年计划，准备在十五年之内，在钢铁和重要工业产品的产量方面，赶上英国，超过英国。
    赶上英国，超过英国，这是最近出现在我们生活里的新的语汇。然而，它对于我们并不生疏。我们每个人的心底，老早就埋藏着这样的希望。当党向工人阶级向全国人民提出了这个伟大任务的时候，在会场上的代表们，无论是维吾尔族的代表阿牙汗，还是蒙族姑娘莫德格，或是哈萨克族的石油工人奴图，或是傣族种植咖啡的青年工人孟必德，都很快地领会了这个任务的全部含义。
    十五年内赶上英国，这是多么豪壮的有伟大气魄的语句啊！只有充满了英雄气概的民族，才有可能给自己树立起这样的奋斗目标。
    英国，这个老牌资本主义国家，尽管他们在播种经济繁荣的种籽的同时，也种下了萧条和死亡的危机，尽管这是客观规律发展的必然结果，但毕竟这是一个在近代工业的道路上已经走过近三百年的国家，是一个向亿万殖民地人民敲髓吸血歛财致富的帝国主义国家。摆在我们面前的事实是：现在他们每年要生产两千多万吨钢，两亿多吨煤。
    然而，事情是要变化的，而且现在正在变化中。来自钢都鞍山的代表们，是这个深刻变化的见证人。鞍钢炼铁厂的副厂长周传典说：从第一个五年计划我国钢铁工业发展的速度来看，英国是肯定要被我们赶上的。解放前，我国钢的最高年产量是九十二万吨，今年预计达到五百二十四万吨，增长了四倍半。建国八年，我们钢产量的增长速度平均每年是70％以上。而英国，1913年是七百八十万吨，经过四十三年，1956年才增长到二千万吨，平均每年的增长速度还不到4％。解放了的人民的双手，真是奇妙的手啊！
    谈起工业发展的速度，出席大会的无论哪一个行业的代表都会告诉你一串确凿有力的数字。煤炭工业的代表说：1948年我国煤的年产量只有一千四百万吨，今年，我国煤的产量将超过一亿二千万吨。大会代表张全聚，是陕西铜川煤矿的采煤工人。他说：就谈谈我们矿上的变化吧。过去扶钎子打榔头的采煤工人，现在成了优秀的割煤机和康拜因的司机。过去的拉车工，现在成了电钻手、风镐手、链板运输机和电机车的司机。现在一个月的煤产量，等于国民党统治时期一年的产量。铜川是一个古老的矿区，远在宋代就开始采煤。此后国民党反动政府也在这里搞了三十多年。然而，他们连一座小型发电厂也没有建成，采煤完全是榔头钎子。而我们不仅新建了近代化的发电厂，而且一对对近代化的竖井建成了；仅三里洞竖井，一年就可以出六十万吨煤。
    1958年即将来临，第二个五年计划的第一年就要开始了。到1962年，我们要争取使钢的产量达到一千二百万吨，煤的产量达到二亿三千万吨，发电量达到四百四十亿度，化学肥料达到七百万吨，水泥产量达到一千二百五十万吨。一幅壮丽的建设图景又展现在我们面前了。代表着全国一千六百万名会员的八百三十一名代表表示：在党的领导下，我们一定要达到这个目标，也一定能够达到这个目标。我们知道，在前进的道路上，有着成千累万的困难。但是，我们也知道，困难是挡不住我们的，一切困难都将被勤劳勇敢的中国工人阶级战胜。
