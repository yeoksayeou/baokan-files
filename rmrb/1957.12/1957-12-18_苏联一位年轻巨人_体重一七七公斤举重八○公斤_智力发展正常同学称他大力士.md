Xinhua News Agency, Pskov, 17th December – According to the “Pskov Pravda” reported on the 12th: There is a fifteen-year-old boy in a village in the Pskov region who weighs one hundred and seventy-seven kilograms and can lift eighty kilograms. This young giant, Vasily Pavlov, can lift a 32-kilogram dumbbell more than twenty times in a row. Vasily is one meter and seventy centimeters tall, with a chest circumference of one meter and thirty centimeters, and a waist circumference of one and a half meters. Clothes and shoes have to be specially made.

Vasily weighed no more than three kilograms at birth. Four months later, his appetite increased greatly, and he grew quickly, so that the shirts sewn for him could not be worn a week later. This fifteen-year-old giant has never been ill. He sleeps more than most people and eats more than adults. His intellectual development is normal—he learned to read before starting school and is good at reciting poems. He entered school at the age of seven, and learning is not difficult for him. He is now studying in the ninth grade, and his classmates call him Ilya Muromets (the name of a Hercules in ancient Russian stories).

    苏联一位年轻巨人
    体重一七七公斤举重八○公斤  智力发展正常同学称他大力士
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社普斯科夫讯：苏联的“普斯科夫真理报”12日报道：普斯科夫州一个村庄里有一个十五岁的少年，体重一百七十七公斤，能举重八十公斤。这位年轻的巨人瓦西里·巴夫洛夫能把三十二公斤重的哑铃一连举上二十多次。瓦西里身长一公尺七十公分，胸围一公尺三十公分，腰围一公尺半。衣服和鞋子都得专门订制。
    瓦西里刚出生时体重不超过三公斤。四个月以后，他的食欲大增，长得也很快，给他缝的衬衫一星期以后就穿不得了。这位十五岁的巨人从来没生过病。他睡得比一般人多，吃得比成年人还多。他的智力发展很正常——入学前就学会了读书，善于背诵诗。七岁入学，学习对他并不吃力。现在他在九年级学习，同学们都叫他伊利亚·穆罗姆茨（古俄罗斯故事中的大力士的名字）。
