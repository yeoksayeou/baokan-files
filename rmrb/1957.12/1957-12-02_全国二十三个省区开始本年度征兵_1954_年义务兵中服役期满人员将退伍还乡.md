Xinhua News Agency, December 1st - Starting today, twenty-three provinces and autonomous regions across the country, in accordance with the State Council's conscription order for 1957, will begin or are about to begin this year's conscription work.

According to the State Council's order, the 1957 conscription work will be carried out from December 1957 to the end of February 1958. Four provinces, including Hebei, Shandong, Hubei, and Sichuan, have already held military service work conferences to make arrangements for publicity and mobilization, physical examinations, political reviews, and other work in this year's conscription efforts. Other provinces and autonomous regions have also made arrangements for the specific timing of conscription in their respective regions.

The new recruits enlisted this year are mainly male citizens who have reached the age of eighteen, and some areas will also enlist a portion of male citizens who are nineteen years old.

Concurrently with this year's conscription work, personnel who enlisted after November 1, 1954, under the compulsory military service system and have completed their service in the Chinese People's Liberation Army will undergo demobilization procedures and return to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production.
