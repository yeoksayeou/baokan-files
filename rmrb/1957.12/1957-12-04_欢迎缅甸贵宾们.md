　　Welcome Distinguished Guests from Burma
    The Burmese Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein and the Burmese Friendship and Economic Delegation he leads are scheduled to arrive in Beijing today. In a few days, another Burmese Deputy Prime Minister, U Ba Swe, and the Burmese Friendship Delegation he leads, will also visit our country. The successive visits of the two Burmese Deputy Prime Ministers is a joyous event for the people of China and Burma. It will be written as an unforgettable episode in the history of friendly relations between China and Burma.
    The people of China and Burma are neighbors, relatives, and "Pauk-Phaws." In the long past, our two peoples lived together in friendship, and we have a deep traditional friendship. In recent years, especially since the joint statement by the Prime Ministers of China and Burma in 1954 on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the friendly relations between our two countries have developed anew. This friendly relationship, built on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, not only conforms to the common interests of the people of China and Burma, but also conforms to the development trend of the entire international relations. China and Burma, together with other peace-loving countries, have set a good example of peaceful coexistence.
    In recent years, mutual visits and personal contacts between government leaders of China and Burma have increased. Our Premier Zhou Enlai has visited Burma twice. Burmese Prime Minister U Nu has visited our country three times. At the same time, the mutual exchanges between our two peoples have also become more frequent. Friendship envoys from cultural, artistic, military, and sports circles of the two countries have come in an endless stream. All these have greatly promoted mutual understanding and friendly cooperation between our two countries.
    The people of China and Burma have had the same experience in the past, and have suffered from the long-term oppression of imperialism. Now our common urgent desire is to develop economy and culture in our own land, to build our respective countries, and to change the backwardness left over by the long-term oppression of imperialism in our two countries. This common urgent desire provides a broad basis for the friendly cooperation between our two countries. In recent years, we are pleased to see that the economic and cultural cooperation between China and Burma has greatly developed. We believe that the friendly cooperation between China and Burma in this regard will have a broader prospect for development.
    We warmly welcome the two Burmese Deputy Prime Ministers and all the distinguished guests of the two delegations! Thank them for bringing the profound friendship of the Burmese people. We wish the distinguished Burmese guests a pleasant stay in our country, and hope that they will bring the friendship of the 600 million Chinese people to the Burmese people. May the flowers of friendship between the people of China and Burma continue to bloom, and bloom forever!

　　欢迎缅甸贵宾们
    缅甸副总理吴觉迎和他所率领的缅甸友好与经济考察团，定于今日到达北京。再过几天，缅甸的另一位副总理吴巴瑞和他所率领的缅甸友好代表团，也将到我国访问。缅甸两位副总理先后来访，这是中缅两国人民的喜事。它将作为一段使人难忘的佳话写在中缅两国友好关系的历史上。
    中缅两国人民是邻居，是亲戚，是“胞波”。在过去长远的岁月中，我们两国人民就是友好相处的，我们有着深厚的传统友谊。近几年来，特别是从1954年中缅两国总理发表了关于和平共处五项原则的联合声明以后，我们两国的友好关系有了新的发展。这种建立在和平共处五项原则的基础上的友好关系，不仅符合中缅两国人民的共同利益，而且符合整个国际关系的发展趋势。中缅两国同其他爱好和平的国家一起，已经树立了和平共处的良好范例。
    近几年来，中缅两国政府领袖之间的互相访问和个人接触日益增多。我国周恩来总理曾经两次访问缅甸。缅甸吴努总理曾经三次访问我国。同时，我们两国人民之间的互相往来也日益频繁。来自两国文化界、艺术界、军事界和体育界等等的友谊使者络绎不绝。所有这些都大大促进了我们两国之间的互相了解和友好合作。
    中缅两国人民过去有过相同的经历，都受过帝国主义的长期压迫。现在我们共同的迫切愿望是：在自己的土地上发展经济和文化，建设我们各自的国家，改变我们两国由于帝国主义长期压迫所遗留下来的落后面貌。这种共同的迫切愿望，为我们两国的友好合作提供了广泛的基础。这些年来，我们高兴地看到，中缅两国的经济与文化合作已有很大的发展。我们相信，中缅两国在这方面的友好合作将会有更广阔的发展前途。
    我们热烈欢迎缅甸两位副总理和两个代表团的全体贵宾们！感谢他们带来了缅甸人民的深情厚谊。我们预祝缅甸贵宾们将在我国度过一段愉快的日子，并希望他们把六万万中国人民的友谊带给缅甸人民。愿中缅两国人民的友谊花朵不断地开放，永远地开放！
