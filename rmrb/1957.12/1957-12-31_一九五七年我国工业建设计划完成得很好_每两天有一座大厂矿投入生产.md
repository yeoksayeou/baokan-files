Xinhua News Agency, 30th – According to the State Economic Commission's estimate, a total of 177 large factories and mines will be put into production this year, an average of one new factory or mine above the quota being put into production every 49+ hours. This is the year with the most production put into operation during China's First Five-Year Plan.

The information provided by the State Economic Commission indicates that China's industrial construction plan for this year has been completed very well.

This year, China's investment in industrial construction was 7.43 billion yuan, exceeding the initial plan by 6.2%.

This year, there were a total of 641 factory and mine construction projects under construction above the quota, an increase of 50 projects compared to the initial plan. Among the projects under construction this year, 107 projects belonged to the "156" projects aided by the Soviet Union; among the projects put into production this year, 22 projects belonged to the "156" projects aided by the Soviet Union.

This year, China also built many small and medium-sized factories and mines, many of which, such as small coal mines, small iron mines, and small gold mines, have already been put into production.

Due to the commissioning of 177 large factories and mines and many small and medium-sized factories and mines, the production capacity of various industrial sectors in China has increased significantly this year. In particular, China's raw material industry and power industry have seen significant increases in new production capacity this year (calculated based on the annual production volume specified in the design documents). According to preliminary estimates, the new production capacity added by the Central Industrial Department alone is 14.89 million tons of coal, 3.25 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity (generating equipment capacity of 650,000 kilowatts), 128,000 tons of synthetic petroleum, 810,000 tons of pig iron, 485,000 tons of steel, 810,000 tons of coke, 90,000 tons of ammonium nitrate, and 1.05 million tons of cement. In addition, the new production capacity added by the light industry is 522,000 pieces of cotton yarn (570,000 spindles), 570 million meters of cotton cloth (19,597 looms), 77,000 tons of machine-made paper, and 87,000 tons of machine-made sugar.

This year, China's industrial construction has further implemented the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, and of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Many construction units have appropriately revised the design based on China's specific economic conditions. For example: the design standards were lowered for projects where design standards could be lowered; domestic equipment was used as much as possible, and unnecessary equipment was reduced; the auxiliary workshops and factory buildings of some factories and mines were reduced or merged; and the land area was reduced. All these measures have significantly reduced non-productive construction investment this year. (Attached picture)

This year, China's industrial construction investment was 7.43 billion yuan.
This year, the number of factory and mine construction projects under construction above the quota increased by 50 compared to the initial plan.
Of the "156" projects aided by the Soviet Union, 107 were under construction this year, and 22 have been put into production.

    一九五七年我国工业建设计划完成得很好
    每两天有一座大厂矿投入生产
    新华社30日讯　据国家经济委员会预计，今年我国全年投入生产的大厂矿共有一百七十七个，平均每四十九个多小时就有一个限额以上的新建厂矿投入生产。这是我国第一个五年计划期间投入生产最多的一年。
    国家经济委员会提供的情况表明，我国今年的工业建设计划完成得很好。
    今年我国工业建设的投资是七十四点三亿元，超过年初计划6.2％。
    今年施工的限额以上的厂矿建设工程共有六百四十一个，比年初拟定的计划增加了五十项。今年施工的工程中有一百零七项是属于苏联帮助我国建设的“一百五十六”项工程；在今年投入生产的工程中，属于苏联帮助我国建设的“一百五十六”项工程的有二十二项。
    今年我国还建设了许多中小型厂矿，其中许多小煤窑、小铁矿和小金矿等企业已投入生产。
    由于一百七十七个大厂矿和许多中小型规模厂矿投入生产，今年我国各工业部门的生产能力都大大增加了。特别是我国原材料工业和动力工业，今年新的生产能力（按设计文件规定的每年的生产量计算）有显著的增加。据初步预计，仅中央工业部新增加的生产能力，煤炭为一千四百八十九万吨，发电量三十二点五亿度（发电设备容量六十五万瓩），人造石油十二点八万吨，生铁八十一万吨，钢材四八点五万吨，焦炭八十一万吨，硝酸铵九万吨，水泥一百零五万吨；此外，轻工业新增加的生产能力，棉纱五十二点二万件（纱锭五十七万枚），棉布五点七亿多公尺（织布机一万九千五百九十七台），机制纸七点七万吨，机制糖八点七万吨。
    今年我国工业建设进一步贯彻执行了勤俭建国和多、快、好、省的方针。许多建设单位根据我国具体的经济条件，适当修改了设计。例如：可以降低设计标准的工程降低了设计标准；尽量采用了国产设备和削减了不必要的设备；有些厂矿的辅助车间和厂房进行了削减或合并；减少了用地面积。所有这些措施，使今年非生产性的建设投资显著减少。（附图片）
