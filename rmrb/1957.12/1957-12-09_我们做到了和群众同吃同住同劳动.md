　　Editor's Note: The following excerpt from a letter is written by Wang Lichun, a cadre sent down from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, to her colleagues in the agency. On September 18th this year, Wang Lichun, along with four other cadres from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and participated in labor production at the Xingsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Shatanping Township, Suide County, Shaanxi Province.

Comrade ××:

　　We have been participating in labor for over half a month. Although the time is not long, the changes in our lives are significant. Now, let me share our experiences.

　　On October 4th, we started eating and living with the peasants, and all of us lived in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants. Initially, the masses were very worried, fearing that we would not be able to eat and live like them. Therefore, they were hesitant to accept us, wanting us five to set up our own kitchen or eat with the township cadres. After repeated explanations, this issue was resolved, and we were assigned to the homes of poor and lower-middle peasant cooperative cadres. However, almost everyone in the village, including the cooperative cadres, doubted whether we could stomach their "bitter food" and, moreover, eat and live with poor and lower-middle peasants. Therefore, after we moved into the peasants' homes, many people were inquiring about the situation. The families that accepted us were also very nervous, asking each other what kind of food to prepare for us, and they always tried to make the food a little better. The so-called better food meant less vegetables and more coarse grains in slightly thicker porridge, or millet and mung bean soup. We often ate potatoes and pumpkin stew. When doing heavy work in the fields, we steamed some black buns (bran mixed with corn, sorghum, or corn husk ground into flour) or corn buns. Compared to the agency, such food was certainly harder to swallow; however, because we were mentally prepared, we didn't feel it was too bitter. As time went on, the masses saw that we ate whatever they ate, and they were relieved and happy. The villagers stopped asking questions, believing that we could eat and live with them.

　　There was also a process involved in laboring together. When we arrived, it was the autumn harvest season. The county committee repeatedly emphasized that the cooperative director should arrange light work for us. Therefore, initially, they didn't let us go to the production team. Instead, several cooperative cadres led us to do some light work, and we had frequent breaks. We felt that it wasn't good to always be with the cooperative cadres without going deep among the masses. So, we discussed it with the cooperative director and decided to go to the production team. We first went to the youth production team. The young people were very enthusiastic towards us, and the Youth League branch secretary in the team took good care of us, fetching water for us to drink during breaks (it was very troublesome to carry water from the foot of the mountain to the top). It was very pleasant to labor with the young people, and we also sang songs and told jokes during breaks, making the atmosphere lively. To get to know more people, we later went to other production teams to labor. One day, we went up a high mountain with some middle-aged and elderly peasants to dig potatoes. Shortly after climbing the mountain, a strong wind started to blow, making it impossible to even open our eyes, and it was very cold! However, although the weather was cold, we persisted until the end of work, finishing digging the potatoes before returning home. That night, the members of this team started discussing, all agreeing that we could endure this hardship (they called working in the fields enduring hardship), and there would be no problem participating in the spring plowing and summer hoeing next year.

　　Now, the autumn harvest work here is basically completed. We have tried almost every kind of work in the fields, and everyone has developed several blisters on their hands. The masses believe that we can labor together with them and often encourage us; as long as we work harder, we can pass this labor test.

### 我们做到了和群众同吃同住同劳动

　　我们做到了和群众同吃同住同劳动
    编者按：下面摘要发表的一封来信，是团中央下放干部王丽纯写给她们机关的同志的。今年9月18日，王丽纯同团中央的另外四个干部一起，响应党中央的号召，到陕西省绥德县沙滩坪乡兴胜农业社参加劳动生产。××同志：
    我们参加劳动已半个多月，时间虽不长，但生活变化不小，现在把我们的体会谈一下。
    10月4日，我们就到农民家里同吃同住，而且都是住在贫农和下中农的家里。最初，群众的顾虑很大，怕我们不能同吃同住，因此都不敢接受，要我们 五人另起炉灶，或者和乡干部同吃包伙。经我们一再解释，这个问题才算解决了，把我们分配到贫农和下中农的社干部家里。但是，几乎全村所有的人，包括社干部在内，对我们能不能吃下他们的“苦饭”，而且是和贫农、下中农同吃同住，都抱怀疑态度。因此，当我们搬到农民家里以后，许多人都在打听消息。接受我们去吃住的人家也很紧张，互相打听给我们做什么饭吃，而且总是尽量把饭做好一些。所谓好饭，也就是少放菜、多放粗粮的稍微稠一些的稀饭，或者是小米和绿豆煮的米汤，经常吃的则是洋芋煮南瓜，下地干重活时就蒸上些黑饽饽（糠加玉米、高粮，或者是玉米皮磨成粉蒸的）或玉米饽饽。比起机关来，这样的伙食当然要苦一些；但是由于我们早有思想准备，也就不觉得有多么苦。这样，日子一长，群众见他们做什么我们吃什么，也就放心了，高兴了，村里的人也不打听了，相信我们能够和他们同吃同住。
    在同劳动的问题上，也有一个过程。我们来时，正赶上秋收。县委一再强调要社长给我们安排轻活，因此最初没有让我们到生产队去，而是由几个社干部领着干一些轻活，而且中间休息的次数多。我们觉得老和社干部一起，不深入群众不好，就和社长商量好去生产队。我们先到了青年生产队，青年人对我们很热情，又有团支部书记在队里，他对我们的照顾很多，休息时给我们找水喝（从山下往山上拿水是很麻烦的）。和青年人在一起劳动很愉快，休息时也唱唱歌，说说笑话，空气显得很活跃。为了多认识些人，以后又去别的生产队劳动。有一天，我们和一些中年老年的农民一起上高山刨洋芋。上山不久，就刮起大风，刮得连眼都睁不开，冷得真是够呛！不过，天气虽然很冷，我们还是一直坚持到收工，把洋芋刨完后才回家。当天晚上，这个队的社员就议论开了，都认为我们能受下这个苦（他们称下地劳动是受苦），参加明年的春耕夏锄问题不大。
    现在，这里的秋收工作已基本结束。地里的每一种活，我们差不多都干了干，每个人的手上都磨了几个泡。群众相信我们能够做到和他们同劳动，并且经常鼓励我们；只要我们再努力些，劳动这一关是可以过去的。
