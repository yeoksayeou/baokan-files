　　The Most Lovable People, The Most Valuable Performance
    Thirty-eight disabled revolutionary soldiers held a beautiful musical performance at the Sichuan Provincial Congress of Literary and Art Workers, which closed last week.

    These disabled revolutionary soldiers from the Sichuan Xin Fanrong Military Sanatorium all participated in the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. When people heard them singing the heroic and majestic song "Forward to Socialism," they did not feel that they were people with physical disabilities.

    Yi Ruyuan, a first-class disabled veteran with fingers amputated on his left hand and blindness in his right eye, played a bamboo flute solo, and Zhang Jiashen, a first-class disabled veteran with both hands amputated, played an organ solo, which greatly moved the audience. He Changjun (female), a first-class disabled veteran with lower limb paralysis, sang the Kazakh folk song "My Flower" and the Sichuan folk song "Embroidered Purse" for everyone. Her singing was full of revolutionary optimism. Under the repeated applause of the audience, she also sang the Sichuan folk song "Waiting for My Love."

    The disabled revolutionary soldiers performed a total of ten programs, which were generally loved by the audience. They called this performance the most valuable performance by the most lovable people. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　最可爱的人  最可贵的演出
    三十八位革命残废军人在上周闭幕的四川省文学艺术工作者代表会议上，举行了一次优美的音乐演奏会。
    这些来自四川省新繁荣军教养院的革命残废军人，全都参加过伟大的抗美援朝战争。人们听到他们唱着“向社会主义前进”的雄壮豪迈的歌声时，一点感觉不到他们是肢体残缺的人。
    一等残废左手截指、右眼失明的易如园的竹笛独奏和一等残废双手截指的张家深的风琴独奏，使听众非常激动。一等残废下肢瘫痪的何长俊（女），为大家唱了哈萨克民歌“我的花儿”和四川民歌“绣荷包”。她的歌声洋溢着革命的乐观主义情绪。在听众一再鼓掌欢迎下，她又演唱了四川民歌“望郎”。
    革命残废军人们一共表演了十个节目，普遍受到听众的喜爱，他们把这次表演称为最可爱的人的最可贵的演出。（新华社）
