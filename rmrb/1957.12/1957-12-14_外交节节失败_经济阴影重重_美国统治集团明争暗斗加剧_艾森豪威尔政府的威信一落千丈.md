Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 13th: Amidst the profound crisis in American foreign policy and the heavy shadow of domestic economic recession, the U.S. ruling clique is in a state of internal strife. The attacks and squabbles between the Democratic and Republican parties, as well as within the Republican Party, are intensifying.

With an eye on next year's congressional elections, the Democratic Party is using the failures of government policy to attack the Republican Party and gain political capital for itself. The struggle for power among factions within the Republican Party is also intensifying.

The launch of two Soviet satellites has greatly diminished the prestige of the Eisenhower administration. Some American newspapers, in commenting on the "crisis of confidence" among NATO countries toward the United States, pointed out that the Republican government's influence is also rapidly weakening domestically. According to a Gallup poll, Eisenhower's personal "prestige" has now fallen to its lowest point since 1954. The newspaper explained that some Americans previously believed Eisenhower was "capable of making the United States lead other countries in industrial and scientific achievements," but due to the launch of the Soviet satellites and various difficulties facing the United States domestically, Eisenhower's image among voters has become "very bad."

In order to reverse the unfavorable situation at home and abroad, the Republican government has recently attempted to pull the Democratic Party in to share responsibility for government policy. Eisenhower invited Democratic leader Stevenson to serve as a consultant to the State Department for a time, asking for his opinions on the American plan for the NATO Paris conference. Secretary of State Dulles also unusually consulted with many senior Democrats, soliciting their opinions on the State Department. At the same time, Eisenhower and Dulles have repeatedly emphasized in their recent speeches that the U.S. government's foreign and military policies should be placed on a "bipartisan basis."

However, the Eisenhower government's plan has not succeeded. The Democratic Party has its own plans.

"U.S. News & World Report" magazine recently said in an article, "Many Democrats are not so interested in the Republican government's invitation... The truth is that Democratic leaders in Washington are currently sensing a trend of political change in their favor. They see the results of recent (state and city) elections, note the public's reaction to news of Soviet scientific and technological progress, and are planning to profit from this trend. They privately admit that if Democratic leaders assume responsibility for making decisions on issues that cause voters concern, it will only benefit the Republican government."

Stevenson has announced that he refuses Eisenhower's invitation and will not attend the NATO conference. He has also ended his tenure as a consultant to the State Department.

Judging from recent statements issued by the Democratic Party leadership, they are basically in agreement with the Republican Party on advocating that the United States should pursue a policy of stepping up arms expansion and driving its "allies" to prepare for war, although they have some differences in specific practices. Currently, in the campaign to greet next year's congressional elections, the Democratic Party is focusing on accusing the Eisenhower government of "lacking a sense of urgency" about the fact that American science and technology are lagging behind the Soviet Union and being responsible for this fact. They also accuse the Republican Party of being responsible for American diplomatic failures and domestic economic recession. According to "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, Democratic Senate Leader Johnson, after launching an investigation into the United States' lagging behind the Soviet Union in missiles, also intends to conduct a comprehensive attack on all aspects of the Republican government.

Conflicts between factions within the Republican Party are also deepening. Some Republican congressmen accuse the government's leadership of being "not forceful enough." After Eisenhower's recent illness, some congressmen publicly demanded that Eisenhower resign and let Nixon become president. Republican Senate Leader Knowland also came out and said that he did not believe Eisenhower would continue to stay in the White House unless Eisenhower felt capable of shouldering the responsibilities of the presidency. There is a movement emerging within the Republican Party to promote Vice President Nixon as the Republican presidential candidate in 1960.

The Democratic Party also has its own factional infighting. "The New York Times" pointed out that Democratic Senate Leader Johnson's talk of Democratic "unity" is only "relative." According to congressional voting records, in the recent 207 votes, about one-third (64) were cast differently by Southern Democrats and Northern Democrats due to differences of opinion. The issues that divide these two parts of the Democratic Party are not only the issue of discrimination against blacks, but also some other specific practices in domestic and foreign affairs.

　　外交节节失败  经济阴影重重
    美国统治集团明争暗斗加剧
    艾森豪威尔政府的威信一落千丈
    据新华社13日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国外交政策深刻危机和国内经济衰退的重重阴影下，美国统治集团内部正处在一片争吵中。民主党和共和党之间以及共和党内部的攻讦倾轧正在越来越激烈。
    着眼于明年国会的选举，民主党正在利用政府政策的失败，攻击共和党，为自己捞取政治资本。共和党内部派系争夺权力的斗争也在加剧。
    苏联两颗卫星上天，使得艾森豪威尔政府的威信大大下跌。一些美国报刊在评论北大西洋公约组织国家对美国的“信任危机”时指出，共和党政府在国内的影响也在迅速减弱。根据盖洛普民意测验所的调查，艾森豪威尔本人的“威望”目前已经跌到了1954年以来的最低点。这家报纸解释说，美国有些人以前认为艾森豪威尔是“可以使美国在工业和科学成就方面比其他国家领先的”，但是由于苏联人造卫星的发射以及美国国内面临的种种困难，艾森豪威尔的形象在选民中已经变得“很糟”了。
    为了要挽回在国内外的不利地位，共和党政府最近企图拉民主党一道来承担政府政策的责任。艾森豪威尔邀请了民主党领袖史蒂文森一度担任国务院顾问，请他对美国关于北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议的计划提供意见。国务卿杜勒斯也少有地同许多民主党高级人士磋商，征求他们对国务院的意见。同时，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯在他们最近的一些言论中还不断强调要把美国政府的外交和军事政策放在“两党的基础上”。
    但是，艾森豪威尔政府这种打算并没有成功。民主党方面有着自己的打算。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”杂志最近在一篇文章里说，“许多民主党人对共和党政府的邀请并不那样感兴趣……事实的真相是，民主党领袖们目前在华盛顿嗅到了有利于他们的政治转变的趋势。他们看到了最近（州和市）选举的结果，注意到公众对苏联科学技术进展的消息的反应，正在打算从这个趋势中取利。他们私下承认，如果民主党领袖在一些引起选民忧虑的问题上承担作出决定的责任，只会使共和党政府得到好处”。
    史蒂文森已经宣布，他拒绝艾森豪威尔的邀请，将不参加北大西洋公约组织会议。他并且已经结束国务院顾问的职务。
    从民主党领导机构最近发表的声明看来，他们在主张美国今后推行加紧扩充军备和驱使“盟国”备战政策上基本上是同共和党一致的，虽然他们在若干具体做法上有某些不同意见。目前，民主党在迎接明年的国会选举的运动中，正集中力量指责的是：艾森豪威尔政府对美国的科学技术落后于苏联“缺乏紧急感”，要对这个事实负责。他们并且指责共和党要对美国外交失败和国内经济衰退负责。据“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志报道，民主党参议院领袖约翰逊在最近发动了对美国在导弹方面落后于苏联一事的调查以后，还打算对共和党政府的各方面进行全面的攻击。
    共和党内部派系间的矛盾也在加深着。一些共和党议员指责政府的领导“不够有力”。在艾森豪威尔这次生病后，一些议员公开要求艾森豪威尔辞职，让尼克松出任总统。共和党参议院领袖诺兰也出来说，他并不相信艾森豪威尔将继续留在白宫，除非艾森豪威尔认为有能力担负总统职务。共和党内部正在出现一个捧副总统尼克松为1960年共和党总统候选人的运动。
    民主党内部也同样有着派系倾轧。“纽约时报”指出，参议院民主党领袖约翰逊所说的民主党的“团结”只是“相对而言”的，根据国会的投票纪录，在最近的二百零七次表决中，约有三分之一（六十四次）是南部民主党人和北部民主党人由于意见分歧而投不同的票。引起这两部分民主党人分歧的问题不仅有歧视黑人的问题，而且也有其他一些内政和外交上的具体做法问题。
