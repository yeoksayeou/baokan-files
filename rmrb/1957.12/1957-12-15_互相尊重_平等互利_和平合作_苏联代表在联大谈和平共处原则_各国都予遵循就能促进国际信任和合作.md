Xinhua News Agency, December 14th dispatch: TASS, New York - The Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly proposed a "Declaration on the Principles of Peaceful Coexistence" at the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on the evening of the 12th, requesting its adoption by the UN General Assembly. Soviet representative Kuznetsov also delivered a lengthy speech on the "Declaration on the Principles of Peaceful Coexistence" and the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy. He said that the Soviet government submitted the draft declaration on the principles of peaceful coexistence to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion based on the definite view that the current international situation poses serious dangers to universal peace. National leaders of all countries in the world, if they want to live in the real world, cannot but consider the obvious fact that today, coexisting with the capitalist system, there is also a new socialist system. He said that the socialist system has become a world family of free people, a world system of countries extending from the Elbe River to the Yellow Sea, with more than one-third of the world's population, one-third of the world's territory, and one-third of the world's total industrial output.

The new socialist system has also produced a new peace-loving foreign policy. This foreign policy is based on the principles of recognizing and respecting the sovereignty of other countries, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful cooperation.

For the Soviet Union and all socialist countries, a peace-loving foreign policy is not a temporary phenomenon, but the foundation of all the policies of these countries.

The Soviet representative traced back the Soviet Union's consistent policy of peaceful cooperation with other countries over the past forty years since its founding. In this regard, the Soviet representative quoted the "Message to the Peoples of All Countries, All Workers and Peasants, Scientific and Cultural Figures, Political and Social Activists, Parliaments and Governments" issued at the celebration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on November 6, 1957. He also mentioned what Khrushchev said during his recent interview with Hearst: if the Soviet Union is not attacked, it will never wage war.

Kuznetsov said that Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Bulganin's letters to U.S. President Eisenhower and the heads of government of Britain, France, and West Germany, putting forward important suggestions on taking necessary measures to ease the existing tension and stop the arms race, are another proof of our Soviet country's peace-loving purpose.

Kuznetsov said that peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and ideologies is by no means a fantasy, or just a theory, but a living reality of the current historical period. The Soviet representative mentioned the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly proposed by China and India in 1954, and at the same time pointed out the significant role of the Bandung Conference of Asian and African countries in uniting and strengthening the forces of peace.

He said that the Soviet Union fully supports the program of peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation among countries, and believes that this is the best basis for establishing normal relations between countries with different social systems.

He said that now many countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa have solemnly declared that these principles are the foundation of their foreign policy, which has the most beneficial impact on the development of relations between these countries.

The Soviet representative especially emphasized the importance of the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. He said that it is extremely necessary not to interfere in each other's internal affairs for economic, political, or ideological reasons, and to take the principle of non-interference as the basis for establishing relations between countries.

Kuznetsov emphasized that the whole problem lies in the fact that it is necessary to recognize that every country has the right to live according to its own wishes, and ideological struggle should be carried out through the exchange of ideas, not by force. As for the Soviet Union, it has never taken up arms to force anyone to accept communist ideas and the socialist social system.

Kuznetsov emphasized that the question of which social system is superior should be decided through peaceful economic competition under the circumstances of normal exchanges between countries.

Kuznetsov pointed out that eliminating the obstacles artificially created by Western countries in economic and cultural cooperation now has special significance for improving international relations and strengthening international trust. He said that now is the time to observe international economic ties with a more realistic attitude, and it should be seen that international economic ties are not a tool for exerting pressure on the policies of this or that country, but a reliable guarantee for maintaining lasting peace, and a tool for uniting countries on the basis of mutual benefit and mutual consideration of each other's interests.

Kuznetsov emphasized that the Soviet state has advocated and now advocates comprehensively and mutually beneficially expanding economic, trade and cultural ties with all countries. He called for opening the door to equal trade, thereby making an important contribution to expanding and consolidating peaceful cooperation among countries. He also said that in the current era of vigorous development of science and technology, such ties are of great significance for realizing the proposition of peaceful coexistence.

The Soviet representative said that the Soviet government attaches great importance to the issue of reaching an agreement on disarmament. He said that the Soviet Union is ready to immediately negotiate effective measures on disarmament. Since there is no necessary trust established among the countries participating in the disarmament negotiations, the Soviet government believes that the establishment of such trust should be promoted, and proposes the following measures to build this trust:

First, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom should temporarily undertake an obligation: not to use nuclear weapons and to declare a cessation of all types of test explosions of such weapons from January 1, 1958, even if it is only for two or three years.

Second, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom should reach an agreement not to deploy any nuclear weapons in East Germany and West Germany. If, in addition to this agreement, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic can also reach an agreement not to produce nuclear weapons and not to deploy such weapons in Germany, then, as the governments of Poland and Czechoslovakia have already formally declared, these two countries will also not produce and will not deploy nuclear weapons in their own countries. In this way, a vast area with more than 100 million people, free of atomic weapons, will appear in Central Europe.

Third, a joint proposal must be drawn up to sign a mutual non-aggression pact between the member states of the North Atlantic Alliance and the member states of the Warsaw Treaty;

Fourth, in order to normalize the situation in the Middle East, it must be agreed not to take any steps that undermine the independence of the countries in the region, and problems related to the Middle East must not be resolved by the use of force.

Direct contact between national leaders can promote the concerted efforts of all countries to strive for the lofty goal of consolidating peace and developing friendly cooperation among the peoples of all countries. In view of this, the Soviet government stated that it is willing to reach an agreement on various issues for direct talks between national leaders. The issues that need to be discussed will be agreed upon by the participants in the talks.

Kuznetsov said that if the above recommendations are implemented, trust will definitely increase. Under such circumstances, it will be possible to finally begin to implement some fundamental measures in the area of disarmament, it will be possible to free the world from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact, and the Warsaw Treaty, and it will be possible to replace these military blocs with a collective security system. Under such conditions, peaceful coexistence and cooperation will become a matter of course.

Kuznetsov finally said that in the current tense international situation, our common primary responsibility is to defend the lofty principles of peaceful coexistence, because these principles make it possible for us to develop international relations along the path of peace and preventing new and destructive wars.

    互相尊重　平等互利　和平合作
    苏联代表在联大谈和平共处原则
    各国都予遵循就能促进国际信任和合作
    据新华社14日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：苏联出席联合国大会代表团在12日晚间的联合国大会政治委员会上提出了一项关于“和平共处原则宣言”的提案，要求联合国大会通过。苏联代表库兹?佐夫并就“和平共处原则宣言”和苏联的和平外交政策，作了长篇发言。他说，苏联政府把和平共处原则宣言草案提交联合国大会讨论，是基于当前国际局势对普遍和平蕴藏着严重危险性这一确定的看法。世界各国的国家领导人，如果想在现实世界里生活，就不能不考虑今天同资本主义制度并存的还有一个新的社会主义制度的这一明显事实。他说，社会主义制度已经变成一个自由人民的世界大家庭，变成从易北河延伸到黄海、拥有世界三分之一以上人口、三分之一领土和三分之一世界工业总产值的国家的世界体系。
    新的社会主义制度也产生了新的爱好和平的外交政策。这种外交政策是以承认和尊重其他国家的主权、平等互利以及和平合作的原则为基础的。
    对苏联和一切社会主义国家来说，爱好和平的外交政策不是暂时的现象，而是这些国家一切政策基础的基础。
    苏联代表回溯了苏联立国四十年来，一贯执行同其他国家和平合作的政策。在这方面，苏联代表引用了1957年11月6日苏联最高苏维埃庆祝会上发表的告世界各国人民、全体工人和农民、科学文化界人士、政治和社会活动家、议会和政府书，还提到最近赫鲁晓夫同赫斯特谈话时说过的话：如果苏联不受到攻击，就永远不会进行战争。
    库兹?佐夫说，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁致函美国总统艾森豪威尔以及英国、法国、西德的政府首脑，就缓和现有紧张局势和停止军备竞赛采取必要手段方面提出重要建议，这是我们苏维埃国家抱着爱好和平的宗旨的又一证明。
    库兹?佐夫说，社会制度和意识形态不同的国家的和平共处决不是幻想，或者只是理论而是当前历史时期的活生生的现实。这位苏联代表提到中国和印度于1954年联合提出的著名的和平共处原则，他同时指出亚非国家万隆会议在团结和加强和平力量方面的重大作用。
    他说，苏联完全支持各国和平共处和友好合作的纲领，并且认为这是社会制度不同的各国建立正常关系的最好的基础。
    他说，现在欧、亚、非三洲的许多国家郑重宣布把这些原则作为本国外交政策的基础，这对这些国家之间的关系的发展产生最有利的影响。
    苏联代表特别强调指出了不干涉他国内政这一原则的重要性。他说，不许因经济、政治或意识形态原因而互相干涉内政并且把互不干涉的原则作为建立各国之间关系的基础，这是极其必要的。
    库兹?佐夫强调指出，全部问题在于必须承认每一个国家有权利按照自己的愿望生活，意识形态的斗争应该通过交流思想进行，而不应该用武力进行。至于苏联，它从来没有拿起武器来强迫任何人接受共产主义思想和社会主义社会制度。
    库兹?佐夫强调指出，哪种社会制度优越的问题应当在各国正常交往的情况下通过和平的经济竞赛来决定。
    库兹?佐夫指出，消除现在西方国家在经济和文化合作方面人为制造的障碍对改善国际关系和加强国际信任有着特殊的意义。他说，现在是时候了，应该用更现实的态度来观察国际经济联系，应该看到国际经济联系不是对这个或那个国家的政策施加压力的工具，而是维护持久和平的可靠保证，在互利和互相考虑对方利益的基础上团结各国的工具。
    库兹?佐夫强调指出，苏维埃国家过去和现在都主张全面地、互利地扩大同各国的经济贸易联系和文化联系。他号召打开平等贸易的大门，从而对扩大和巩固各国和平合作作出重要贡献。他还说，在当前科学技术蓬勃发展的时代，这种联系对于实现和平共处的主张有着重大意义。
    苏联代表说，苏联政府对于达成裁军协议的问题极为重视。他说，苏联准备立刻就裁军的有效措施进行商谈。由于参加裁军谈判的各国间没有建立必要的信任，苏联政府认为应当促进这种信任的建立，并提出下列作为建立这种信任的措施：
    苏联、美国和英国暂时先承担一项义务：不使用核武器和从1958年1月1日起宣布停止一切类型的这种武器的试验爆炸，最初那怕是停止两、三年也好。
    苏联、美国和英国应当就不在东德和西德境内安置任何核武器达成协议。如果在这项协议之外，德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国还能就不生产核武器和不在德国境内配置这种武器达成协议，那末正如波兰和捷克斯洛伐克政府已经正式声明过的，这两个国家也将不生产和不在本国境内配置核武器。这样一来，在欧洲中部就会出现一个拥有一亿多人口的、非原子武装的广大地区。
    必须拟订一个联合建议，来签订北大西洋联盟成员国和华沙条约成员国这两个国家集团互不侵犯的协定；
    为了使中近东局势正常化，必须约定不采取任何破坏这个地区的国家的独立的步骤，并且必须不使用武力解决有关中近东的问题。
    各国领导人的直接接触可以促使各国同心协力，为巩固和平和发展各国人民间的友好合作这一崇高目标而奋斗。有鉴于此，苏联政府表示，愿意就各国领导人直接会谈各项问题达成协议，需要讨论的问题由会谈参加者商定。
    库兹?佐夫说，如果实现上述建议，信任一定会增加，在这种情况下就有可能终于着手实现裁军方面的一些根本措施，就可能使世界摆脱北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织、巴格达条约、华沙条约，就可能用集体安全体系代替这些军事集团。在这种条件下，和平共处和合作将会成为不言而喻的事实。
    库兹?佐夫最后说，在目前国际局势紧张的情况下，我们共同的首要职责是，保卫和平共处的崇高的原则，因为这些原则使我们有可能沿着和平和制止新的毁灭性战争的道路发展国际关系。
