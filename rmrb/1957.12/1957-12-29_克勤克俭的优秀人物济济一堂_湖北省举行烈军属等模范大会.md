Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 27th: The Hubei Province Conference of Active Elements in Socialist Construction and Models of Supporting the Army and Giving Preferential Treatment to Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Soldiers, Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized Soldiers was held in Wuhan City from the 20th to the 25th. The more than 500 outstanding individuals and representatives of advanced units who attended the meeting unanimously expressed their determination to bring forth revolutionary vigor and contribute even greater strength on the production front.

Through extensive exchange of experiences, the active participants at the conference clarified that in the revolutionary upsurge of the great leap forward in agricultural production throughout the province, they should take the lead in "diligence" and "frugality." In the past year, the vast number of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers in Hubei Province have made many contributions in the labor of building their hometowns. Hu Jiaji, a disabled soldier who is blind, and Yu Xietian, a disabled soldier who lost both hands, with superhuman revolutionary perseverance, diligently studied and practiced hard, and finally overcame numerous difficulties and learned many agricultural production skills. Lu Hua, a military dependent in Xinzhou County in her fifties, is a model of diligence and thrift. She formulated a "seven diligence and seven frugality" plan for her family, which included diligently going to work, diligently accumulating fertilizer, diligently learning technology, diligently engaging in sideline occupations, diligently eliminating the four pests, diligently picking up firewood, diligently calculating income and expenditure accounts, and saving food, feed, wedding and funeral expenses, cotton cloth, holiday expenses, pocket money, savings, and preparing for famine. In less than two years, she accumulated more than one hundred yuan in savings. Her experience in managing the household diligently and frugally is now being promoted. Xu Xiuzheng, an old mother of a revolutionary martyr, her husband and eldest son who joined the Red Army were killed in battle with the White Army more than 20 years ago, and her youngest son was also persecuted to death by the landlord. Now she is over seventy years old and lives alone, but she never asks the government for help. She has earned more than 600 work points in the first half of this year. Her hardworking and arduous style has become a model for the masses, and she was admitted to the Chinese Communist Party last year.

The revolutionary spirit and firm proletarian stance displayed by demobilized soldiers such as Zhang Xuewan who attended the meeting in quelling the counter-revolutionary riot at Hanyang No. 1 Middle School were praised by everyone. In June of this year, during the counter-revolutionary riot at Hanyang No. 1 Middle School instigated by counter-revolutionary elements such as Wang Jianguo, more than a dozen demobilized soldiers, including Zhang Xuewan, risked their lives, stepped forward bravely, and fought with the rioters to protect the party and government organs.

The active participants at the meeting expressed their determination to guard against arrogance and rashness, continue their efforts, and strive for greater achievements. Cheng Aixian, deputy secretary of the party branch of Xiaomiao Township in Tianmen County, who is a military dependent, and Zhang Benying, a female township head of Yangji Township in Jingshan County, who is a family member of a revolutionary martyr, proposed a competition on the spot. They plan to take the lead in revising production increase plans after returning and launch a "seven diligence and seven frugality" campaign throughout the township. He Jiehuan, director of the Puqi County Farm and a family member of a soldier, used to be somewhat complacent, but now he said that he would catch up and announced his five guarantees, including "taking the lead in production, cultivating two mu of experimental fields, and achieving an annual yield of 2,000 jin per mu." Chen Zhenguo, a demobilized soldier who once forgot his roots and made erroneous remarks, made a profound self-criticism with the help and encouragement of the representatives' revolutionary enthusiasm, and promised to catch up with the advanced figures in labor.

    克勤克俭的优秀人物济济一堂
    湖北省举行烈军属等模范大会
    新华社武汉27日电　湖北省烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人社会主义建设积极分子和拥军优属模范大会20日到25日在武汉市举行。到会的五百多名优秀人物和先进单位的代表，一致表示要拿出革命干劲来，在生产战线上贡献更大力量。
    参加会议的积极分子们从广泛交流经验中，明确了在全省农业生产大跃进的革命高潮中，自己要在“勤”、“俭”两个方面起带头作用。在过去的一年，湖北省广大的烈属和军属、残废军人和复员军人在建设自己家乡的劳动中作出了很多贡献。双目失明的残废军人胡家吉、失掉双手的残废军人余协田，以超人的革命毅力，勤学苦练，终于战胜重重困难，学会了很多农业生产活路。新洲县军属、五十多岁的卢华先，是个勤俭持家的典范。她为自己的家庭制订了勤出工、勤积肥、勤学技术、勤搞副业、勤除四害、勤拣烧柴、勤算收支账和节省粮食、饲料、节约婚丧嫁娶费用、节省棉布、节省节日费用、节省零用钱、节约储蓄、节约备荒等“七勤七俭”规划，不到两年就积蓄了一百多元的存款。她的勤俭持家经验现在正在推广中。革命烈属徐修正老妈妈，她的当红军的丈夫和大儿子二十多年前在和白军作战中牺牲了，小儿子也被地主逼死。现在她已年逾七十，只身一人，但从来不向政府伸手要求帮助，她在今年大半年的时间里得到了六百多个工分。她的勤劳艰苦的作风已经成为群众的榜样，去年被吸收参加中国共产党。
    出席大会的复员军人张学万等人在平息汉阳一中反革命暴乱事件中表现的革命气概和坚定的无产阶级立场，受到大家的赞扬。今年6月间，反革命分子王建国等制造的汉阳第一中学反革命暴乱中，张学万等十多个复员军人，冒着危险，挺身而出，同暴乱者进行搏斗，保护了党政机关。
    参加会议的积极分子们表示要戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，争取更大成就。军属、天门县小庙乡党支部副书记程爱先和烈属、京山县杨集乡女乡长张本英当场提出竞赛，她们准备回去后带头修改增产规划，并且发动全乡开展“七勤七俭”运动。军属、蒲圻县农场场长何介环过去有些自满情绪，现在他表示要迎头赶上，并且向大家宣布了他订出的“带头生产，搞两亩试验田，每亩年产量达二千斤”等五项保证。一度忘本、发表过错误言论的复员军人陈振国，在代表们的革命热情帮助和鼓舞下，作了深刻检讨，保证在劳动中赶上先进人物。
