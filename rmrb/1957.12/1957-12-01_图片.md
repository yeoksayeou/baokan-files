    The Shanxi Phosphate Fertilizer Plant is designed by our own country. After completion, it can produce 100,000 tons of superphosphate powder fertilizer and 100,000 tons of granular fertilizer annually. These phosphate fertilizers can increase cotton production by more than 500,000 tons, or increase wheat production by more than 950,000 tons.

    山西磷肥厂是我国自己设计的，建成后，每年可生产过磷酸钙粉肥十万吨，粒肥十万吨。这些磷肥可以增产棉花五十多万吨，或增产小麦九十五万多吨。
