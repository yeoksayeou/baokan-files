Lessons from the Past

　　In the spring and summer of last year, many agricultural cooperatives in some areas lacked funds, and many members lacked pocket money. Cries of "too tight" and "too stingy" were heard everywhere, causing everyone great distress for a time. The reasons for this situation were very complex, related to the capitalist thinking of some members, and also related to shortcomings in the work of running the cooperatives. One of the reasons was the relaxation or even abandonment of sideline production during the production upsurge of the previous winter and spring.

　　Last winter and this spring, another deviation occurred; some members only cared about engaging in their own sideline occupations, even engaging in speculative trading. Some cadres also relaxed their leadership over the basic construction of agricultural cooperatives, to the extent that capitalism showed a tendency to rise in the countryside, and collective and long-term interests were neglected.

　　This winter, after a great debate, another socialist agricultural production upsurge has emerged. We should comprehensively accept the experiences and lessons of the past, and not forget or squeeze out sideline production, but make it an important part of the entire production upsurge. This year's production upsurge came early, and many areas have completed most of their annual plans for water conservancy construction, which is a good condition for carrying out winter sideline production this year. Now is the time, let's all seize winter sideline occupations in a timely manner like the Laiyang Prefectural Committee of Shandong!

### 前车之鉴

　  前车之鉴
    在去年春天和夏天，在不少地方，曾经有一些农业社缺少资金，有许多社员缺零花钱，“太紧了”“太死巴了”的呼声四起，一时弄得大家十分苦恼。发生这种情况的原因是很复杂的，同一部分社员的资本主义思想有关，同办社工作中的缺点也有关。其中原因之一，是在前冬去春的生产高潮中放松了甚至丢掉了副业生产。
    去冬今春，又出了另一种偏向；一些社员只顾搞自己的副业，甚至经营投机买卖，有些干部也放松了对农业社的基本建设的领导，以至资本主义在农村有抬头之势，集体利益、长远利益被忽视了。
    今年冬天，经过大辩论，社会主义的农业生产高潮又出现了。应该全面地接受过去的经验和教训，不要把副业生产忘掉或者挤掉，而要使它成为整个生产高潮的一个重要部分。今年生产高潮来得早，许多地区已经完成了兴修水利的年度计划的大部分，这是今年开展冬季副业生产的一个好条件。现在是时候了，都像山东莱阳地委这样及时地把冬季副业抓起来吧！
