	Thoroughly Air Views, Resolutely Rectify, Accelerate Production
	Airing Views While Rectifying, Major Rectification After Airing Views
	This newspaper reports that the rectification movement in the rural areas of Tianjin's suburbs has fully entered the stage of focusing on rectification.
	During the period of great airing of views, many townships and cooperatives, in accordance with the spirit of airing views while rectifying, immediately solved some problems that could be resolved immediately. Many members of the Happiness Road Agricultural Cooperative in the Huiguan Township of the Southern Suburb District criticized some cooperative cadres for not going deep among the masses. Jiang Deyu, the director of the cooperative, took the lead in going to each production team to openly review his shortcomings in his work to the members. Many township and cooperative cadres in Hanzhou and Tianmu in the Northern Suburb District, Yangchang in the Eastern Suburb District, and Dahanzhuang in the Western Suburb District did not go to the fields or rarely participated in production. After being criticized by the members, they have also made corrections.
	Due to the timely resolution of some problems, the enthusiasm of the masses for airing views and their initiative in production have been further stimulated. In the past, cadres in Tianmu Township in the Northern Suburb District rarely participated in production. This time, when the branch secretary and other township and cooperative leaders began to work in the fields, the members worked even harder. Member Mu Xiangyun used to carry thirty ridges in half a day. That day, he saw the branch secretary working with him, and he carried sixty ridges in half a day.
	The previous stage of the rectification movement in the rural areas of Tianjin's suburbs mainly focused on mobilizing the masses to air their views, so only a very small part of the opinions raised by the masses has been rectified. According to the instructions of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, each district and township decided to set aside a period of time after the basic end of the great airing of views to concentrate on rectification.

	Cadres Improve Their Work Style, Members Accelerate Production
	This newspaper reports that after the Unity Agricultural Cooperative in Linxia City, Gansu Province, entered the rectification stage, it concentrated its efforts on solving major problems and launched a high tide of production and construction. After the cadres and work team of this cooperative collected and sorted out the opinions aired by the members, they first solved four major problems that hindered current production: 1. In the past, township cadres generally issued more calls for work in the cooperative and provided less specific help. Most of the cooperative cadres did not participate in labor, riding bicycles and "flying all over the sky." They either shirked or criticized the problems raised by the members. The members had a lot of opinions about this work style. This time, after accepting the members' opinions, the township and cooperative cadres uniformly arranged work and participation in labor production, and implemented field office work. 2. The cooperative has operated more than a dozen sideline businesses in the past year, earning more than 50,000 yuan. However, most of this money was invested in expanded reproduction, and very little was distributed to the members. Many members had no pocket money and could not afford winter clothes. Now, without waiting for the distribution and final settlement, 2,000 yuan was taken from the sideline business income and the purchase price of grain and distributed to the members in difficulty. 3. Some unreasonable labor quotas were revised. 4. The allocation of draught animals in each production team was not reasonable enough. Some teams had a surplus of livestock, while others did not have enough. At the beginning of the rectification, a joint meeting of old farmers and feeders was convened to revise the feeding and use system, and adjustments were made to the unreasonable phenomena of strength and weakness. After these four problems were solved, the members' confidence in running the cooperative was greatly encouraged. They said: "The cadres are determined to improve their work, and we are motivated to produce." From November 1st to 21st, this cooperative has built more than 200 mu of terraced fields in twenty-one days, which is equal to 70% of the total plan; it has pulled more than 130,000 loads of city manure and cleared farm fertilizer, which is equal to 53% of the fertilizer used for spring plowing. Other tasks such as winter irrigation and plowing have been completed or are nearing completion. (Shan Zongming)

	Not Only Promotes Production, But Also Improves Thinking
	This newspaper reports that the Xinqiao Agricultural Cooperative in Zhihe Township, Huanggang County, Hubei Province, has rectified the cadres' work style and strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses.
	The cadres in this township originally had great concerns about rectifying the cooperative, thinking that rectifying the cooperative meant rectifying the cadres: some said, "How can a cadre not offend people?"; some said, "Asking us to voluntarily go downstairs (take the initiative to examine), wouldn't it be better for us to voluntarily step down?" Therefore, their attitude was negative. At this time, the Party branch explained to everyone that not only should the masses be allowed to speak out, but the cadres should also be allowed to speak out; mistakes should be boldly and resolutely corrected, and misunderstandings should be clarified, thus mobilizing the cadres' enthusiasm for rectifying the cooperative, and then mobilizing the masses to put forward opinions.
	The Party branch promptly collected the opinions, published them one by one, and educated the relevant personnel to humbly examine and correct their mistakes. At the cadres' meeting of the whole cooperative, the cadres with shortcomings made self-criticisms. Hu Chuyou, the deputy director of the cooperative, was given fourteen opinions by the members, nine of which were facts, and the remaining five were misunderstandings, and they were respectively examined, dealt with, and explained. In addition, the opinions on collective leadership were handled by one cooperative director, and problems that could be solved immediately, such as unclear financial accounts, were solved immediately; problems that could not be solved immediately, such as uneven distribution of draught cattle and unreasonable "three guarantees," were decided to be solved when discussing the improvement of operation and management.
	On this basis, a meeting of cooperative member representatives was convened. First, the cooperative cadres made systematic self-criticisms and explanations, and then the representatives were allowed to raise criticisms again, and then a plan for handling the problems was adopted. After the representatives returned to their respective teams, they conveyed and discussed the plan to distinguish right from wrong. For example, member Lei Hongshan said that the promotion of early and late intercropping by cadres was subjectivism. In fact, intercropping increased production by 140 catties per mu. As a result of the debate, everyone said, "It's not that the cadres are subjective, but that your thinking is conservative."
	Now the masses reflect that in the future, if the cadres make mistakes, we will help them in time. If we have shortcomings ourselves, we must consciously correct them.

	Cadres are Determined to Rectify, Members Speak Their Minds
	This newspaper reports that the Ninth Production Team of the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Dalate Banner, Ik Zhao League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, promptly accepted the opinions of the masses, improved its work, and promoted the great airing of views during the great debate.
	After the great debate, the Ninth Production Team of the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative promptly convened a joint meeting of team and group leaders to examine the work style in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, study one by one the problems related to operation and management and the urgent need to be solved in the current production raised by the masses, and put forward specific methods for improving the work.
	For the accounts of financial income and expenditure, according to the opinions put forward by the members, they were promptly sorted out and posted on the list. When the Qianjin Cooperative was established, the team had forty large carts. In the past two years, due to the team's poor operation and management, and some members did not take care of the vehicles when they used them and did not repair them when they were damaged, the result was that they were scattered and only more than twenty vehicles could be used now. In this regard, the members had made suggestions, but they did not attract the attention of the person in charge of the team. This time, the members criticized the leadership again. After discussion, the custodians of each group made self-criticisms; the leaders and custodians of each group of the production team were responsible for finding the broken vehicles and repairing them.
	The Ninth Production Team promptly announced the improved work situation at the meeting of cooperative members, and explained the opinions raised by the members that could not be achieved temporarily. The members were very satisfied; some people who had concerns in the past also continued to air many opinions and spoke their minds.

    彻底鸣放　坚决整改　加紧生产
    边鸣放边整改  鸣放后大整改
  　本报讯　天津郊区农村的整风运动，已经全面转入着重整改阶段。
    在大鸣大放阶段，许多乡、社根据边鸣放边整改的精神，对有些能马上解决的问题，立即加以解决。南郊区会馆乡幸福之路农业社的许多社员，对有些社干部不深入群众提出了批评。社主任姜德玉便带头到各生产队去，公开向社员检讨自己工作中的缺点。北郊区汉沟、天穆，东郊区杨场，西郊区大韩庄等许多乡的乡、社干部，没有下地或很少下地生产，经社员提出批评后，现在也都作了改正。
  　由于有些问题的及时解决，进一步激发了群众的鸣放热情和生产积极性。北郊区天穆乡的干部过去很少参加生产。这次，当支部书记等乡社领导干部开始下地生产的时候，社员们干起活来也更起劲了。社员穆祥云原来半天挑三十个畦，这天，他看见支部书记和他一起干活，半天就挑了六十个畦。
    天津郊区农村整风运动的前一阶段，主要是发动群众大鸣大放，因而已经整改的还只占群众提出意见的很小一部分。各区乡根据中共天津市委的指示，决定在大鸣大放基本结束之后，专门拿出一段时间，集中力量进行整改。
    干部改进作风  社员加紧生产
    本报讯　甘肃省临夏市团结农业社转入整改后，集中力量解决主要问题，掀起了生产建设高潮。这个社干部和工作组把社员鸣放出来的意见集中整理后，首先解决了其中妨碍当前生产的四个重大问题：一、以前乡干部对社的工作一般是号召多，具体帮助少，多数社干不参加劳动，骑着自行车“满天飞”，对社员提出的问题，不是推托就是批评，社员对这种作风很有意见。这次接受社员意见乡、社干部统一安排了工作和参加劳动生产的问题，实行田间办公。二、这个社一年来经营的副业十多种，赚钱五万多元，但是这些钱大部分投入了扩大再生产，分给社员的很少，很多社员没零钱用，换不上冬衣。现在不等分配决算，从副业收益及统购粮价款中提出两千元分给了有困难的社员。三、修改了一些不合理的劳动定额。四、各生产队的耕畜搭配不够合理，有些队畜力有剩余，有些队不够用。整改开始，便召开了老农和饲养员联席会议，修订了饲养使用制度，对强弱不合理的现象，作了调整。这四个问题解决后，大大的鼓舞了社员的办社信心。他们说：干部有决心改进工作，我们有劲头生产。这个社从11月1日到21日的二十一天中，已修梯田二百多亩，等于全部计划的70％；拉城粪和清理农家肥料十三万多驮，等于春耕用肥的53％，其他如漫冬水和犁地等工作，大都已经完成和接近完成。　（单宗明）
    不仅推动生产  还提高了思想
    本报讯　湖北黄冈县治河乡新桥农业社，整顿干部作风，密切了干部和群众的关系。
    这个乡的干部原来对整社有很大顾虑，认为整社就是整干部：有的说，当干部哪有个不得罪人的事；有的说，叫我们主动下楼（主动检查），那我们主动下台不更好些。因此态度消极。这时，党支部对大家说明，不光叫群众把话说尽，干部也要把话说尽；是错误应大胆坚决地改正，是误会会搞清楚，因而调动了干部对整社的积极性，接着便发动群众提意见。
    党支部及时地将意见集中起来，逐条公布，并教育有关人员要虚心检查，改正错误。在全社干部大会上，有缺点的干部作了检讨。该社副主任胡楚友，社员对他提了十四条意见，其中有九条是事实，其余五条是误会，分别作了检查处理和说明。此外，关于集体领导方面的意见，由一个社主任负责处理，马上可以解决的，如财务账目不清，立即解决；不能马上解决的，如耕牛搭配不匀、“三包”不合理等，决定在讨论改善经营管理时解决。
    在此基础上，召开了社员代表大会，先由社干进行系统检讨和说明后，让代表再次提出批评意见，然后通过了处理问题的方案。代表回到各队后，进行传达讨论分清了是非。如社员雷洪山说推广早晚连作是干部主观主义，实际连作每亩增产一百四十斤，辩论结果大家说，不是干部主观，是你思想保守。
    现在群众反映说，今后干部有错，我们要及时帮助。我们自己有缺点，也要自觉的改。
    干部整改决心大  社员说出心里话
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区伊克昭盟达拉特旗前进农业社第九生产队在大辩论中，及时接受群众意见，改进工作，推动了大鸣大放。
    前进农业社第九生产队在大辩论后，及时召开了队、组长联席会议，以批评和自我批评的精神，检查了工作作风，逐条研究了群众提出的有关经营管理和当前生产中迫切需要解决的问题，并提出了改进工作的具体办法。
    对于财务收支的账目，根据社员所提的意见，及时地作了整理，并列榜公布。前进社建社时，该队有四十辆大车，两年来，由于队里经营管理不善，再加以个别社员使用车辆时不爱护，坏了也不修理，结果弄得七零八散，现在只有二十几辆车能使用了。对此，社员们曾提出过建议，但没有引起队里负责人的注意，这次社员们对领导上又提出了批评。经过讨论，各组保管员都作了检讨；生产队各组长和保管员负责，找回破车，进行修理。
    第九生产队及时将改进工作情况，在社员大会上作了公布，并将社员们提出的那些暂时办不到的意见，作了说明，社员们非常满意；一部分过去有顾虑的，也继续鸣放出许多意见，说出了心里话。
