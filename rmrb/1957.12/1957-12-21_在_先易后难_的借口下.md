    Under the Pretext of "Easy First, Difficult Later"
    Mu Yang
    "Easy first, difficult later" is an important method in the current rectification work. Using this method, many organizations have genuinely solved many problems. However, some organizations, under the pretext of "easy first, difficult later," are classifying some problems that can be solved now as "difficult," refusing to deal with them and preparing to continue delaying them.
    During the initial airing of views in the rectification campaign, some people in the head office of the People's Construction Bank of China suggested that the ranks of more than 30 cadres in the bank were too high, and some were too low. This problem, however, made the leaders of the organization feel difficult to solve, and they prepared to put it aside temporarily for processing in the fourth stage. Where exactly is the difficulty? It is said that the ranks of most people are not too high, and it is difficult to explain this to the masses one by one; one person's rank is said to be too low because the historical issues have not been clarified, and this is also difficult to explain to the masses, so we have to wait until the fourth stage.
    Are these problems so "difficult" that they must be left to later? The Bureau of Government Offices Administration of the State Council provided a contrary example. Some people in the Bureau of Government Offices Administration also suggested that the ranks of 58 cadres were too high, and some cadres should be promoted. During the rectification, the leaders handed over the list of these cadres and relevant materials to the masses for discussion. The result of the discussion was that only six people should be downgraded, and those who were too low in rank could also not be promoted for the time being.
    These two examples show that whether it is difficult or easy depends on the problem itself, and also on whether the masses are thoroughly relied upon. If you don't go to the masses to find solutions, but treat some problems that are not "difficult" enough as "difficult," then "easy first" is indeed easy, but the "difficult later" will accumulate more and more, and by the fourth stage, it will be even more difficult.

### 在“先易后难”的借口下

    在“先易后难”的借口下
    穆扬
    “先易后难”，是目前整改工作中的一个重要方法。运用这种方法，许多机关真正的解决了不少的问题。但是，有些机关却在“先易后难”的借口下，将一些现在可以解决的问题划到“难”里边去，不予处理，准备继续拖延下去。
    在整风初期的鸣放中，中国人民建设银行总行的一些群众提出：行里有三十几个干部的级别偏高了，也有人偏低了。这样一个问题，却使机关的领导人感到难以解决，准备暂时留起来，到第四阶段再进行处理。究竟难在哪里呢？据说多数人的级别并不偏高，难向群众一一解释；有一个人级别定的较低，据说是因为历史问题没有查清楚，这也难向群众说清楚，因此，只好到第四阶段再说了。
    这类问题是不是“难”到必须留到以后的程度呢？国务院机关事务管理局却提供了相反的例证。机关事务管理局有的群众也曾提出有五十八名干部的级别偏高，也有的干部应该提级。在整改中，领导上把这批干部名单和有关的材料，全部交给群众讨论。讨论的结果是：只有六人应该调低，偏低的同志也可以暂时不提级。
  这两个事例说明，究竟是难是易，一方面决定于问题本身，另方面也决定于是否彻底地依靠群众。如果不到群众中想办法，只是把一些不够“难”的问题，也当作“难”，“先易”固然易矣，但是“后难”越积越多，到了第四阶段那就难上加难了。
