Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The disaster relief work in some areas of Shandong, Henan and other provinces and regions that were affected by floods and droughts this year has been successful. Now, on the basis of doing a good job in production for self-salvation, the people in the disaster areas have also launched a large-scale movement to build water conservancy projects and accumulate fertilizer, and are striving to win a bumper harvest next year and fundamentally eliminate famine.
　　The Central Disaster Relief Committee convened responsible persons from relevant departments in six provinces and autonomous regions with severe disaster areas, including Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Heilongjiang, and Jiangsu, for a week-long disaster relief symposium, which concluded on the 16th. The reporter learned from the meeting that although natural disasters were relatively serious in some local areas of these six provinces and regions this year, because when the disasters occurred, the disaster-stricken provinces and regions, with the support of the central government, the whole country, and the People's Liberation Army, carried out rescue work quickly. After the disaster, they also seized the opportunity to help the disaster victims rebuild their homes, drain water to rush-plant late autumn crops, fight drought to protect autumn crops, and fight drought to plant wheat. Especially after the large-scale socialist debate was launched in the vast rural areas and the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program was published after the autumn, the farmers in the disaster areas improved their ideological awareness and confidence in production for self-salvation. Now, the situation in the disaster areas is stable.
　　Judging from the reports at the meeting, the achievements of disaster relief work in various provinces and regions are great. Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu and other provinces drained water and rushed to plant late autumn crops on a total of 14.4 million mu. Most of the disaster areas also completed the winter wheat sowing task under the severe autumn drought. After autumn, all disaster areas launched movements to build water conservancy projects and develop sideline production in exchange for work. According to Heilongjiang's plan, from October this year to March next year, the income from sideline businesses in the disaster areas of the province can reach more than 40 million yuan, which can make up for 60% to 80% of the losses caused by the disaster.
　　The state has issued 290 million yuan in relief funds and a large number of loans this year, which has played a positive role in supporting the people in disaster areas to carry out production for self-salvation and stabilizing the lives of disaster victims.
　　The symposium fully exchanged views on how to further comprehensively carry out disaster relief work, further solve many difficulties in the production and life of disaster victims, ensure that disaster victims spend the winter safely, and prevent spring and summer famines next year. The meeting believed that ensuring the safe wintering of disaster victims still requires arduous work. Some areas did not fully take care of disaster relief work due to their full efforts in the large-scale production movement, and did not pay enough attention to leading sideline production; in some places, relief funds were not delivered to disaster victims in a timely manner. What is even more urgent is that food supply has not kept up in some places. Some disaster victims in the flood-stricken areas of Shandong and Henan are still in urgent need of repairing their houses, and livestock in the disaster areas lack fodder, etc. Only when all these tasks are done comprehensively, the problems of food, clothing, housing, and medical treatment of disaster victims are solved, and the draught animals in the disaster areas are protected, can we better carry out the large-scale production movement, end the famine as soon as possible, and fundamentally overcome the famine.
　　The meeting believed that today's disaster relief conditions are much better than in the past, the grain and funds allocated to the disaster areas are much more than in the past, and the socialist ideological awareness of the disaster victims has been greatly improved. We were able to do a good job in disaster relief in such difficult times as in 1949, and today we should do a better job in disaster relief and ensure that there are no problems. We must continue to strengthen the political and ideological education of the disaster victims. In light of the ideological trends of cadres and the masses, we must pay attention to carrying out education on relying on the collective strength of agricultural cooperatives, with the support of the state, to produce for self-salvation and save resources to overcome famine, and oppose ideas such as simply relying on relief and wasteful phenomena. The meeting requested all localities to closely grasp the disaster situation and establish a disaster situation reporting system every few days; leading organs should frequently enter the disaster areas for inspection. At present, it is necessary to immediately organize a general inspection of relief work, especially to check food supply, house repair, relief fund distribution, and livestock fodder, etc., and solve problems in a timely manner when they are discovered. Responsible cadres must always be in charge of disaster relief work. When cadres are assigned to lower levels, consideration must be given to strengthening the grassroots forces in the disaster areas. The method of Henan sending a large number of leading cadres to be stationed in the disaster areas to be contracted to be responsible for disaster relief work can be considered for trial implementation in various places. The meeting also requested the severely affected provinces and regions to place disaster relief work in an important position, make comprehensive plans for the work in the disaster areas, and make unified arrangements and allocation of labor in accordance with local conditions and time, so that production disaster relief can be closely integrated with the movement of building water conservancy projects and accumulating fertilizer; arrange the production of disaster victims and quickly stop the blind outflow of disaster victims.
　　In addition to the 41.35 million yuan of natural disaster relief funds for 1958 that have been allocated by the state, another 38.5 million yuan of relief funds have recently been allocated to the five severely affected provinces and regions to support the people in the disaster areas to produce to overcome the famine.

    搞好生产自救努力消灭灾荒
    中央救灾委员会举行救灾座谈会
    据新华社讯　今年山东、河南等省、区部分水旱成灾的地区救灾工作有成绩，现在灾区人民在搞好生产自救的基础上，同样展开了大规模的兴修水利和积肥运动，正在为争取明年丰收并从根本上消灭灾荒而努力。
    中央救灾委员会召集山东、河南、山西、内蒙古自治区、黑龙江、江苏等六个有重灾区的省、区有关部门负责人员，举行了为时一周的救灾座谈会，已于16日结束。记者从会上获悉：这六个省、区的局部地方今年自然灾害虽然比较严重，但是由于灾情发生时，受灾省、区在中央和全国以及人民解放军支援下，抢救工作迅速，灾后又抓紧了帮助灾民重建家园、排水抢种晚秋作物和抗旱保秋、抗旱种麦等工作，特别是入秋后，广大农村展开大规模的社会主义大辩论和全国农业发展纲要修正草案公布后，灾区农民提高了思想觉悟和生产自救的信心。现在，灾区情况是安定的。
    从会上的汇报看，各省、区救灾工作的成绩很大。山东、河南、江苏等省雨后排水抢种晚秋作物共一千四百四十万亩。大部分灾区在秋旱严重的情况下又都完成了冬麦的播种任务。秋后各灾区都展开了以工代赈兴修水利的运动和副业生产。据黑龙江的计划，从今年10月到明年3月，全省灾区的副业收入可达四千多万元，可弥补因灾损失的60％到80％。
    国家在今年发放了救济款二亿九千万元和大量贷款，这对支持灾区人民的生产自救，安定灾民生活起了积极的作用。
    座谈会对于进一步全面作好救灾工作，进一步解决灾民生产和生活上的许多困难，保证灾民安全过冬并预防明年的春荒和夏荒等问题充分交换了意见。会议认为：保证灾民安全过冬仍需作艰巨的工作。有些地区由于全力进行大生产运动，对于救灾工作全面照顾不够，对领导副业生产重视不够；有些地方救济款没有及时发到灾民手中。更迫切的是有的地方粮食供应没有跟上，山东、河南水灾区还有部分灾民的房屋急待修复，灾区牲口缺乏饲草等。只有全面地把这些工作都做好了，灾民的吃、穿、住、治病等问题都获得了解决，灾区的耕畜都保护下来，才能更好地开展大生产运动，才能及早结束灾荒和从根本上克服灾荒。
    会议认为：今天的救灾条件比过去好多了，拨给灾区的粮款比过去多的多，灾民的社会主义思想觉悟大大提高。在1949年那样困难的时候，我们能够把灾救好，今天就更应当做好救灾工作，保证不出问题。要继续加强对灾民的政治思想教育工作，针对干部、群众的思想动态，注意进行依靠农业社集体力量，在国家扶持下，生产自救、节约渡荒的教育，反对单纯依赖救济等思想和浪费现象。会议要求各地密切掌握灾情，建立几天一报的灾情报告制度；领导机关要勤入灾区检查。目前需要立即组织一次对救济工作的普遍检查，特别是检查粮食供应、房屋修复、救济款发放、牲口饲草等问题，发现问题及时解决。要有负责干部始终掌握救灾工作，在下放干部时，要照顾到灾区加强基层力量。河南派出大批领导干部驻在灾区包干负责救灾工作的办法，各地可考虑试行。会议还要求重灾省、区把救灾工作摆在重要的地位，对灾区工作作出全面规划，因地、因时制宜地对劳动力作出统一的安排和调配，使生产救灾同兴修水利和积肥的运动做到紧密结合；安排好灾民的生产，迅速制止灾民盲目外流。
    国家除已拨发了1958年自然灾害救济事业费四千一百三十五万元外，最近又对五个重灾省、区拨出救济事业费三千八百五十万元，支持灾区人民生产渡荒。
