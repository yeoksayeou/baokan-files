Thrift and Diligence is Strength
--A Sideline Account of the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions
By Our Correspondent

	An inspiring picture is placed before the delegates of the Congress, before the people of the whole country: Catch up! Surpass England in fifteen years, and build our country into a socialist nation with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.
	How to catch up? Is there the strength to catch up? This is a very important question. Comrade Li Fuchun's report listed various conditions and analyzed the full possibilities of catching up with England. As long as we adhere to the Party's policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, mobilize all positive factors, and utilize all favorable conditions, we will surely be able to catch up.
	Building socialism requires material strength, and diligence and thrift are the source of creating social material strength. Building socialism also requires ideological strength, and diligence and thrift are the source of building socialist ideological strength. This is a common understanding among representatives from various regions.
	Despite the various difficulties that may be encountered in the course of construction, history proves that there are no insurmountable difficulties in the face of the working class. The Chinese working class is hardworking, brave, and thrifty. History will continue to record how the working class, in the process of socialist construction, diligently and thriftily, bravely undertakes all hardships and difficulties, and strides towards the road of socialism.

	The Tradition of Yan'an
	People who came from the revolutionary holy land—Yan'an—still remember the arduous circumstances of creating small-scale industries in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region during the War of Resistance Against Japan. At that time, under the strict blockade of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the economy of the Border Region was very difficult. Workers used the raw materials produced in the Border Region, with a small amount of capital and simple equipment, to start businesses and establish seventy-seven small factories, including textile, papermaking, chemical, coal, porcelain, printing, clothing, and so on. They farmed while working, fought while producing, and achieved self-sufficiency in essential daily necessities, supporting the War of Resistance Against Japan. This spirit of hard work and thrifty construction wrote a glorious page in the history of the Chinese workers' movement.
	Today, the difficult days like those in Yan'an are gone forever, but the spirit of hard work and thrift of the Yan'an workers will always be a model for socialist construction. Zhao Xishan, chairman of the Yan'an County Trade Union, reported to the Congress how the Yan'an workers carried forward the revolutionary tradition and inherited the spirit of running enterprises with diligence and thrift. Ten years ago, in the spring, Hu Zongnan's bandit troops of the Kuomintang reactionaries occupied Yan'an, almost completely destroying the little industry that the Yan'an workers had created with their bare hands. The following year, Yan'an was liberated, and many machines were scattered on the ground as piles of scrap iron. What to do? The workers did not retreat in the face of difficulties, nor did they ask the state for money, but instead picked up broken tools from the ruins and rebuilt. The Yan'an Fengzuo Match Factory is one of many small factories. From the day it resumed production in 1948, the factory has not added any new equipment or investment, relying entirely on its own hands to improve production equipment. Without iron frames, wooden frames were used instead; without a phosphorus sulfide mixer, an iron teapot was used instead; without a pulverizer, a porcelain jar filled with stones was used as a crushing tool. Last year, this factory changed from phosphorus sulfide matches to safety matches, which originally required equipment such as phosphorus brushing machines and ball mills. In order to save investment, they used waste iron cylinders containing red phosphorus to load stones and built two wooden frames. They also used gypsum instead of zinc oxide and soft waxed paper instead of Hungarian waxed paper, and some of their experiences have been promoted to other match factories across the country. As a result of their diligence and thrift in running the enterprise, the factory had already completed the tasks of the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in 1955.
	The creative spirit and hardworking style of the Yan'an workers left a very deep impression on the delegates attending the meeting. Comrade Zhao Xishan said that running enterprises with diligence and thrift has become a revolutionary tradition in Yan'an, and the slogan of the Yan'an workers is "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory."

	The Experience of Veteran Workers
	Many veteran workers have a different understanding of building the country with diligence and thrift. In the old society, veteran workers also wanted to rely on their hard work to build a prosperous and strong country and hoped that their lives would also be improved. But what was the result? The country became weaker and weaker, and their own lives were in a state of hunger and cold. Now the situation is different. The socialist construction of the country is developing rapidly, and the lives of the workers are also gradually improving. Producing one more share of materials means adding one share of happiness to the people; saving one more cent means adding one share of construction power to the country.
	Veteran workers who have suffered in the old society are often the most reliable backbone for running enterprises with diligence and thrift. Qin Shiliang, a worker representative from Jilin, is such a person.
	This forty-eight-year-old worker started working as a mason at the age of twelve. Before liberation, he traveled to many places, did many jobs, and suffered a lot. One New Year's Eve, wealthy families were making dumplings and setting up banquets, but he could only sell a pair of pants to buy a piece of soybean cake to feed his family. Now, he is a technician and foreman at the Jilin Paper Mill, with a monthly salary of more than one hundred yuan. When he thinks about how things are now compared to the past, he feels uneasy, always feeling that he has given too little to the country and the country has given him too much.
	In 1952, the crushed stone (a kind of stone with high hardness, wear resistance, and large volume—igneous rock) used for papermaking in the factory was running out. This kind of stone used to be imported from abroad, costing more than eight thousand yuan per piece. Importing it every year would cost so much foreign exchange! Could we find a way to find this material ourselves? Qin Shiliang considered it again and again, "We certainly can," he said, "I don't believe that such a big China of ours can't even find a piece of such stone." He asked the leadership to give him the task to handle it himself. The leadership approved his request, so he took a sample and ran from Jilin to Shenyang, and then from Shenyang to Fushun, asking everywhere. When he encountered stone shops or grinding shops, he took out the sample and asked people, "Do you have this kind of stone?" When he saw workers carrying hammers and axes, he also chased after them and asked, "Do you know where to find this kind of stone?" In this way, he asked many people and finally found this kind of stone in Xiang'ershan. Xiang'ershan is a barren mountain more than seventy miles away from Fushun City. That day, he was so hungry that he couldn't bear it, so he picked wild vegetables on the mountain to eat, and when he was thirsty, he drank a few mouthfuls of water from the river ditch. Then, he took a few people to live on the mountain for two months until the stone was transported down the mountain and made into finished products. The cost of this crushed stone is only more than one hundred yuan per unit. Qin Shiliang found such a cheap raw material, which opened up a broad path for paper mills in various places to reduce costs, and showed people the power of hard work.

	The Factory Director Must Manage Tightly
	Whether a factory can truly achieve thrift and avoid waste has a lot to do with the factory director. If the factory director does not have the concept of running the enterprise with diligence and thrift, then the entire enterprise cannot be run well. If the factory director always adheres to the principle of saving money and resolutely struggles against waste, then a new atmosphere will appear in the enterprise. The Northeast Lingyuan Power Plant is full of this good atmosphere. When you come to this factory, you can't find a good piece of paper in the wastebasket or ask anyone for a good piece of paper. Why? Because after the anti-waste campaign, the management plan was tightened. Originally, the factory's expenditure plan was very lax, and there was waste of rags for wiping machines, machine parts, and coal for heating. Sometimes, workers often argued with the custodians in order to get matches. Whenever the factory director Zhao Haishan swept the floor and dumped the wastepaper basket, he often saw very good paper, which was crumpled and thrown away without writing a few words on it. He felt very distressed. He thought, if this continues day after day, how much waste would accumulate in a year! Soon after he took office, he discovered this problem and immediately organized management personnel to conduct special discussions and formulate a strict expenditure plan. The boiler workshop used to use two boxes of matches per month, but after the shift system was implemented, one box per month was enough. In the eyes of some people, a little bit of good paper mixed in the wastepaper, and a few more boxes of matches taken from the workshop, how much are they worth? But in Zhao Haishan's view, it was a major event, an event related to improving enterprise management. The Lingyuan Power Plant used to be a dilapidated small factory with very low power generation efficiency. Through the efforts of Zhao Haishan and all the workers, without increasing manpower and material resources, the power generation time was extended from eight hours to twenty-two hours, so that the power generation was more than doubled compared with 1953, fully supplying electricity to several factories. From this, we can see the important position of planned management in enterprises. A piece of paper, a box of matches, and a kilowatt-hour of electricity may seem like nothing, but if you relax management, it will cause waste.

	× × ×
	Under the socialist system, the accumulation of funds mainly depends on the hard work and thrift of the people across the country. Many facts prove that our potential for increasing production and practicing economy is great. As long as we fully tap this potential and make the funds play a greater role, we can make our construction scale larger and faster.
	What is socialist style? It is becoming increasingly clear now. Hard work and thrift is socialist style. During the first Five-Year Plan period, many factories learned this style, and they can withstand inspection; some enterprise leaders used to suffer from the problem of being fond of greatness and novelty, and some enterprises had too much non-productive construction. After correction, they also began to learn the ability to run enterprises with diligence and thrift. The history of socialism is a history of diligent and thrifty construction, and hardworking and thrifty people will forever be written in the annals of socialism.

　　勤俭就是力量
　　——中国工会第八次代表大会侧记
　　本报记者
    一幅振奋人心的图景摆在大会代表面前、摆在全国人民面前：赶上去！十五年超过英国，把我国建成为一个现代工业、现代农业、现代科学、文化的社会主义国家。
    怎样赶上去？有没有力量赶上去？这是一个很重要的问题。李富春同志的报告列举各种条件，分析了赶上英国的充分可能性。只要我们坚持党的勤俭建国的方针，动员一切积极因素，利用一切有利条件，我们就一定能够赶上去。
    建设社会主义需要物质力量，勤俭就是创造社会物质力量的泉源。建设社会主义也需要思想力量，勤俭就是建设社会主义思想力量的泉源。这是各地代表共同的体会。
    尽管在建设途程中还会遇到这样那样的困难，历史证明，在工人阶级面前没有不可克服的困难。中国工人阶级是勤劳的、勇敢的、也是俭朴的。历史将继续记载着：工人阶级在社会主义建设过程中如何勤劳节俭，勇敢地承担起一切艰难和困苦，迈向社会主义的大道。
            延安的传统
    从革命圣地——延安出来的人还念念不忘抗日战争期间，陕甘宁边区创建小型工业的艰苦情况。当时，在国民党反动派的严密封锁下，边区的经济是十分困难的。工人们利用边区出产的原料，以少量的资金、简陋的设备创立家业，建立起七十七个小型工厂，包括纺织、造纸、化学、煤、磁、印刷、被服等等。他们一边种地、一边工作，一边打仗、一边生产，做到了主要日用必需品自给自足，支援了抗日战争。这种艰苦奋斗、勤俭建设的精神，给中国工人运动史上写下了光荣的一页。
    今天，像延安那样艰苦的日子已经一去不复返了，而延安工人勤劳节俭的精神永远是社会主义建设的榜样。延安县工会主席赵西山向大会报告了延安职工是怎样发扬革命传统、继承勤俭办企业的精神的。十年前的春天，国民党反动派胡宗南匪军侵占了延安，把延安工人赤手空拳创立起来的一点工业几乎摧毁得干干净净。第二年，延安解放，许多机器变成了一块块一堆堆的废铁散落在地上。怎么办呢？工人们没有在困难面前退却，也没有向国家要钱，而是在废墟上检起破破烂烂的工具重新建设。延安丰足火柴厂就是许多小型工厂的一个。这个厂从1948年恢复生产的一天起，没有增加新的设备和投资，完全靠着自己的双手，改进了生产装备。没有铁架子就用木架子代替，没有硫化磷搅拌机就用铁茶壶来顶替，没有粉碎机就用一个磁罐子装些石子来做粉碎工具。去年，这个厂把硫化磷火柴改为安全火柴，本来需要刷磷机、球磨机等设备。为了节省投资，他们利用装赤磷的废铁筒装起石子，架了两个木架子就搞起来了。他们还用石膏代替氧化锌，软腊纸代替匈牙利腊纸，而且，有些经验已经在全国其他火柴厂推广了。由于他们勤俭办企业的结果，这个厂已经在1955年提前完成了第一个五年计划的任务。
    延安工人的创造精神和艰苦作风给到会的代表留下了极深刻的印象。赵西山同志说，勤俭办企业在延安已经成为革命传统，延安工人的口号是“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣。”
            老工人的体会
    许多老工人对于勤俭建国有着与众不同的体会。在旧社会里，老工人也想依靠自己的勤劳，把国家建设得富强起来，并且希望自己的生活也得到改善。可是，结果呢，国家一天天贫弱，自己的生活也处于饥寒交迫的境地。现在的情况不同了，国家的社会主义建设迅速发展，工人的生活也逐步改善。多生产一分物资，就意味着给人民增加了一分幸福；多节约一分钱，就为国家增加一分建设力量。
    在旧社会里吃过苦头的老工人，常常是勤俭办企业最可靠的骨干。来自吉林的工人代表秦世亮就是这样一种人。
    这位四十八岁的老工人，从十二岁上就开始做泥瓦匠。解放前，他走过很多地方，干过很多活，吃过很多苦。有一年除夕，有钱的人家都在包饺子、摆酒席，可是他却只能卖掉一条裤子，买一块豆饼给全家来充饥。现在，他是吉林造纸厂的技术员、工段长，每月工资一百多元。他一想现在比过去，心里就忐忑不安，总觉得自己给国家的太少，国家给自己的太多了。
    1952年，厂里造纸用的再碎石（一种硬度很强、耐磨擦、体积大的石头——火成岩）眼看就要不够用了。这种石头过去都是由国外进口，每块要八千多元。年年进口，得多少外汇呀！能不能自己想办法找到这种材料呢？秦世亮考虑再三，“一定能，”他说：“我就不信咱们这么大个中国，连块这样的石头也找不到。”他要求领导上把这个任务交给他亲自办。领导上批准了他的要求，于是他带着一块样品从吉林跑到沈阳，又从沈阳跑到抚顺，到处打听。他碰到石头铺、磨铺，就拿着样品问人家：“你们有没有这种石头？”看见了背着锤子、斧头的工人，也追过去问：“你知道哪儿有这种石头？”就这样，问了很多人，终于在想儿山找到了这种石头。想儿山是一座距抚顺市七十多里路的荒山。这一天，他饿得耐不住了，就采摘山上的野菜当饭吃，渴了就喝几口河沟里的水。接着，又带上几个人在山上住了两个月，直到把这种石头运下山，制成成品。这种再碎石的成本，一台只要一百多元。秦世亮找到了这样廉价的原料，为各地造纸厂降低成本开辟了广阔的道路，给人们显示了勤劳的力量。
        厂长要管得紧
    一个工厂能不能真正做到节俭，没有浪费，跟厂长有很大的关系。如果厂长没有勤俭办企业的观念，那么，整个企业就不可能办好。如果厂长处处坚持节约的原则，坚决同浪费现象作斗争，那么，企业里就会出现一种新的风气。东北凌源发电厂就充满了这种良好的风气。到了这个厂，你想在纸篓里找一张好纸或者随便向哪个人要一张好纸，那是办不到的，为什么？因为在反浪费以后，管理计划卡紧了。原来，这个厂的经费开支计划是很不严格的，擦机器的破布、机器零件以及取暖用煤，都存在着浪费现象，有时，工人们为了领取火柴，也经常和保管员争吵。厂长赵海山每次扫地和倒字纸篓的时候，常常看到很好的纸张，没有写上几个字，就被揉成一团扔掉了。他感到很痛心，他想，这样一天天扔下去，一年积累起来，该是多大的浪费啊！他到职不久发现这个问题，就立即组织管理人员专门进行讨论，制订了严格的开支计划。锅炉车间每月要用火柴两盒，后来实行交接班制，每月只用一盒就够了。在有些人看来，废纸里杂着一点好纸，车间里多领几盒火柴，能值几个钱呢？可是，在赵海山看来却是一件大事，是一件关系到改进企业管理的大事。凌源发电厂原来是破破烂烂的小厂，发电效率很低，经过赵海山和全体工人的努力，在不增加人力和物力的情况下，把发电时间由八小时延长到二十二小时，使发电量比1953年增加了一倍多，充分供应了几个工厂的电力。从这里可以看到计划管理在企业中的重要地位，一片纸、一盒火柴、一度电好像算不了什么，然而，你如果放松管理，就会造成浪费。
                  ×　×　×
    在社会主义制度下，资金的积累主要依靠全国人民的勤劳节俭。许多事实证明，我们增产节约的潜力是很大的，只要我们把这种潜力充分挖掘出来，并且使资金发挥更大的作用，就可以使我们的建设的规模更加大一些，速度更加快一些。
    什么是社会主义气派？现在愈来愈明确了。勤劳节俭就是社会主义气派。在第一个五年计划期间，有不少的工厂学会了这种气派，他们是经得起检查的；有一些企业领导人员曾经患过好大喜新的毛病，有些企业的非生产性的建设太多，经过纠正，也开始学习勤俭办企业的本领。社会主义的历史就是一部勤俭建设的历史，勤劳而节俭的人们将永远写在社会主义的史册上。
