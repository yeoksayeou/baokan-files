Construction Busy at the Foot of Jinping Mountain

    A modern new-style phosphate mine is under construction at the foot of Jinping Mountain, located in the area of the Xin Hailian City in northeastern Jiangsu.

    On the small hilltop that has been leveled, a tall derrick stands, which will be the future central main shaft. Below the main shaft, factory buildings are being built. The frame of the concentrator workshop has been completed, and the east and west auxiliary shafts, the fine crushing workshop, the powder ore silo, the ball mill workshop, the central machine repair shop, and other projects are under construction in full swing, with some already completed.

    The majority of the production process at this mine is mechanized. Once this mine is fully operational, it will produce 1.2 million tons of ore annually, from which 300,000 tons of concentrate will be selected from the apatite and supplied to chemical fertilizer plants as raw materials.

    锦屏山下建设忙
    位于江苏东北部新海连市辖区内的锦屏山下，正在建设一座现代化的新型磷矿。
    目前被削平了的小山头上，矗立起高大的凿井架，这就是未来的中央主井。主井下面，正在建造厂房。精矿处理车间枢架已经完成，东西附井、细碎车间、粉矿仓、球磨车间、中央机修厂等工程已全面施工，有的已经竣工了。
    这个矿的绝大部分生产过程都是机械化的。这个矿全部投入生产后，每年可产矿石一百二十万吨，从磷灰石中再选出三十万吨精矿供给化学肥料厂做原料。　（陈哲）
