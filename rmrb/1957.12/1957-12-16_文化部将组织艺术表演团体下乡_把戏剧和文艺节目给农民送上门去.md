Xinhua News Agency, December 15th—The Ministry of Culture recently decided that vigorously organizing art performance troupes to go to the countryside and mountains, bringing dramas and artistic programs to the farmers' doorsteps, will be the key focus of touring performances in 1958. More than ten theaters and song and dance troupes directly under the Ministry of Culture's Bureau of Arts have decided to spend a quarter of their time next year touring the countryside and factories and mines, contributing first-class Peking Opera, Kunqu Opera, puppet and shadow plays, acrobatics, spoken drama, and song and dance to the farmers.

The Bureau of Arts of the Ministry of Culture recently convened a National Art Performance Troupes Touring Performance Conference for representatives of cultural administrative departments, theaters, and performance troupes from various provinces and cities. The conference stipulated that all state-owned art performance troupes nationwide must spend at least two to three months next year going deep into rural areas, factories and mines, remote areas, or minority nationality areas to perform (with no less than half of that time spent performing in rural areas). Representatives from theaters and performance troupes in Beijing and other regions who attended the conference also signed contracts regarding next year's touring performances. More than ten theaters and art troupes directly under the Ministry of Culture have also stipulated that each theater and troupe should make long-term plans, organize actors and staff to take turns touring the countryside and factories and mines; that performance in rural and industrial and mining touring performances should be an important basis for individual performance appraisals; and that major actors must participate in rural and industrial and mining touring performances, etc.

The conference pointed out that going deep into factories, rural areas, and troops to give touring performances is an important measure for implementing the policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and is also an important method for training actors and staff. The main shortcomings of the current touring performance work are that certain cultural departments and troupes, as well as actors, have not attached universal importance to touring performances, especially to rural touring performances, and their implementation is not resolute enough. In order to cooperate with the great socialist construction in rural areas, inspire farmers' enthusiasm for production, meet the growing cultural demands of the vast collective farmers and educate them, doing a good job in rural touring performances is an urgent task.

After summarizing the experience of touring performances in recent years, the conference pointed out that when performing in rural areas, the programs must suit the tastes of the farmers. Attention should be paid to selecting and performing good traditional repertoires, and special attention should be paid to repertoires that reflect real life. Quality must be guaranteed, and major actors must go down [to the countryside]. The performance must pay attention to adapting to the characteristics of rural production and life. The programs should be small and diverse, and the team should be lightly equipped and flexible. Joint performances of opera, song and dance, and acrobatics can be considered. The more important issue is that actors and staff must truly integrate with the farmers ideologically and in action, strengthen learning from the farmers, and strengthen labor training to improve themselves. The conference also required professional art performance troupes to do a good job of guiding local folk professional troupes and mass amateur art groups when touring the countryside.

At the meeting, Liu Zhiming, Vice Minister of Culture, gave important instructions on the national touring performance work. He asked cultural departments in various regions to strengthen the planning and leadership of touring performances, and put forward the principle of "overall planning, hierarchical management, combination of top and bottom, and rational arrangement." He hoped that cultural departments in various regions would help troupes pilot the establishment of rural touring performance points, promote art performance troupes going down to the countryside and factories, and at the same time, rationally arrange performances in urban theaters and ensure a certain artistic quality.

### 文化部将组织艺术表演团体下乡  把戏剧和文艺节目给农民送上门去

　　文化部将组织艺术表演团体下乡
    把戏剧和文艺节目给农民送上门去
    新华社15日讯  大力组织艺术表演团体下乡上山，把戏剧和文艺节目给农民送上门去，这是文化部最近决定的1958年巡回演出的重点工作。文化部艺术局直属的十多个剧院和歌舞团已经决定明年用四分之一的时间到农村和厂矿巡回演出，把第一流的京剧、昆曲、木偶皮影剧、杂技、话剧和歌舞贡献给农民。
    文化部艺术局最近召集各省市文化行政部门和剧团、剧场的代表举行了1958年全国艺术表演团体巡回演出会议。这次会议规定，全国所有的国营艺术表演团体明年必须至少以二至三个月的时间深入农村、工矿、边远地区，或少数民族地区演出（其中去农村演出的时间不得少于二分之一），出席这次会议的北京和各地剧团、剧场的代表之间并已就明年的巡回演出签定了合同。文化部直属的十多个剧院和艺术团还规定：各院、团应作长期规划、组织演员、职员轮流去农村、工矿巡回演出；以在农村工矿巡回演出中的表现作为对个人考绩的重要依据；去农村、工矿巡回演出必须有主要演员参加等。
    会议指出，深入工厂、农村、部队巡回演出，是贯彻文艺为工农兵服务的方针的重要措施，也是锻炼演员和职员的重要方法。目前巡回演出工作的主要缺点是某些文化部门和剧团以及演员们对巡回演出、特别是到农村巡回演出没有引起普遍的重视，执行得不够坚决。为了配合农村中的社会主义大建设，鼓舞农民的生产热情，适应广大集体农民日益增长的文化要求并对他们进行教育，作好农村巡回演出工作是迫不及待的任务。
    会议在总结了几年来巡回演出的经验后指出，去农村演出，节目要适合农民口味，应注意选演好的传统剧目，尤其应注意反映现实生活的剧目，要保证质量，主要演员必须下去。演出要注意适应农村生产及生活特点，节目应小型多样，队伍要轻装灵活，可以考虑组织戏曲、歌舞、杂技等的联合演出。更重要的问题是演员和职员必须从思想上、行动上真正同农民打成一片，加强向农民学习，加强劳动锻炼以提高自己。会议还要求专业艺术表演团体在下乡巡回演出时，作好对当地民间职业剧团和群众业余艺术团体的辅导工作。
    会上，文化部副部长刘芝明对全国巡回演出工作做了重要指示，他要求各地文化部门加强对巡回演出的规划和领导，提出了“全面规划，分级管理，上下结合，合理安排”的方针，希望各地文化部门帮助剧团试行建立农村巡回演出点，提倡艺术表演团体下乡下厂，同时也应当合理地安排城市剧场的演出，并保证一定的艺术质量。
