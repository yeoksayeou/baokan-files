Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 28th: The Zhongshan Sugar Refinery, with a daily crushing capacity of 2,000 tons of sugarcane, began production yesterday. This is another large-scale mechanized sugar refinery designed, manufactured, and installed by China itself, following the Nanhai Sugar Refinery's entry into production. It can produce more than 43,000 tons of white sugar annually.

This factory is built in the rich Pearl River Delta, surrounded by sugarcane fields. Rivers and streams crisscross outside the factory, and transportation is convenient. During the crushing season, sugarcane farmers will transport sugarcane to the factory day and night by boat from all directions, and white sugar will also be shipped out from here continuously.

    日榨甘蔗二千吨的糖厂
    据新华社广州28日电　日榨甘蔗二千吨的中山糖厂昨天开工生产。这是继南海糖厂投入生产后又一座由我国自行设计、制造和安装的大型机械化糖厂。它每年能生产白砂糖四万三千多吨。
    这个厂建设在富饶的珠江三角洲，附近蔗林遍布。厂外河泊交错，交通方便；在开榨季节，蔗农将从四面八方日夜驾船运送甘蔗进厂，白糖也由这里源源出厂。
