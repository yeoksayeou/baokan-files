One Batch Cannot Be the End of It

In some factories in Shanghai, leading personnel, when handling opinions from the masses during the rectification movement, adopted a method similar to how they usually process official documents. After receiving opinion letters from the masses, they would write phrases like "Will pay attention in the future," "Criticism is welcome," and "Will definitely correct" on them and then send them to the rectification group, considering the matter settled.

Such a batch is not the end of it. What is needed is action. Even if it concerns issues of ideology and work style that cannot be completely corrected at once, it is still necessary to immediately make a self-criticism to the masses, letting them see that you have the determination to correct yourself. Merely giving such a big batch of approvals raises serious doubts about whether you are truly "welcoming criticism" and "definitely correcting."

To these comrades, we respectfully offer this couplet:

	Facing the new situation,
	Unwilling to change old ways.

As for the horizontal inscription, let's use "Still the Same Old Me."

### 一批岂能了事

　  一批岂能了事
    上海市有的工厂领导人员，在整风运动中处理群众意见的时候，采取了像平时批公文一样的办法。群众的意见书拿来以后，他们就批上“今后注意”、“欢迎批评”、“一定改正”等字样，往整改组一送就算了事。
    这样一批是不能了事的。需要的是行动。即使是思想作风方面的问题，不能一下子完全改好，也需要马上向群众作检讨，让群众看到你有改正的决心。只是这样的大笔一批，是不是真的“欢迎批评”，“一定改正”，是十分令人怀疑的。
    对这些同志，敬赠这样一付对联：
    面对新形势
    不改旧作风
    至于横额，那就用“依然故我”好了。
