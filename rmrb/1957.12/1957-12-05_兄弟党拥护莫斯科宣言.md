　　Fraternal Parties Endorse Moscow Declaration
　　Albanian Labor Party
　　Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 4th: The Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party held a plenary session on December 2nd.

　　The plenary session heard the report made by the First Secretary of the Party Central Committee, Hoxha, on the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries, and unanimously endorsed the two declarations of the Moscow meeting.

　　The plenary session passed a resolution. The resolution pointed out: The meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries is of historic significance, and it has made great contributions to consolidating and further developing the international workers' movement, to consolidating the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to consolidating the progressive forces fighting for peace, democracy, and socialism. The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party expressed satisfaction with the unbreakable unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, because this unity gives a heavy blow to imperialism and to the enemies of socialism who attempt to split the socialist countries, especially those who attempt to separate the socialist countries from the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

　　The resolution said that the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are the center of the international communist movement, and our party will always strive to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and to strengthen the friendship between the peoples of all countries.

　　The resolution pointed out that revisionism is the greatest threat to the current international communist and workers' movement, and said: Our party has carried out a persistent struggle against revisionism, sectarianism, and dogmatism, and will continue to fight for the purity of Marxism-Leninism in the future.

　　The resolution finally called on the entire party to carefully study these two major documents as a guide to all practical activities and to publicize these two historic documents to the working masses together with people's organizations and propaganda institutions.
