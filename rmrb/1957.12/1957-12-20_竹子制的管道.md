    Bamboo Pipes
    The Chongqing Universal Machine Factory has successfully trial-produced painted bamboo pipes. These pipes are made of bamboo that has been treated for insect prevention, corrosion resistance, and waterproofing, and their service life is not inferior to that of steel. These pipes also have the advantages of being acid-resistant, alkali-resistant, rust-free, and not causing electrolytic reactions with the soil. They can be used not only in rural pumping stations, small power stations, and artificial rainfall stations, but also in urban drainage or chemical plants.

    These pipes are inexpensive, reducing engineering investment by more than half compared to cast iron pipes, and by 30% to 50% compared to asbestos cement pipes.

    竹子制的管道
    重庆通用机器厂试制涂料竹制管道成功。这种管道，是用经过防虫、防腐、防水处理以后的竹材制成的，使用寿命并不次于钢材。这种管道还有耐酸、耐碱、不生锈、跟土壤不起电解作用等优点，不但可以用于农村的抽水机站、小型电站和人工降雨站，还可以用于城市排水或化工厂。
    这种管道价格低廉，与铸铁管比较可降低工程投资一半以上，与石棉水泥管比较也可以降低30％—50％。
