    Whenever Soviet comrades mention Armenia, they habitually add an adjective: our sun-drenched Armenia. This republic, located in the subtropical zone, indeed has sunshine as its important treasure. Throughout the year, it brings bountiful harvests to vineyards, orchards, wheat fields, cotton fields, beet fields, and olive trees. Livestock grow up under the sunshine, wine ferments under the sunshine, and life moves towards happiness and prosperity under the sunshine. Almost no corner, no object is untouched by the soft sunlight. In the evening, when we stand on the Kanaker Heights in the capital, Yerevan, and look far into the distance, the Hrazdan River rushes down from the plateau, stirring up dazzling waves; Mount Ararat and Mount Aragats stand facing each other north and south, the snow-capped peaks all year round painting a rare white on the blue sky; the forests in the valleys, the flocks of sheep on the grasslands, and the houses in the city built of tuff, basalt, and granite, are quietly bathed in the sunlight. Because the air is thin, it looks so transparent, bright, and clean, as if untouched by dust. We have come to a rare fairyland.
    The fairyland is located on a plateau averaging one thousand meters above sea level, holding the gateway to the Mediterranean, the Near East, and Central Asia. The history of Armenia can be traced back to 2,500 years ago. For many centuries, this nation resisted the invasions of the Romans, Arabs, Persians, Turks, and Mongol Khans, enduring the pain of war. Hunger and disaster did not spare them either. Before the revolution, the plateau also had plenty of sunshine, but the lakes were evaporated by the sun and not used to irrigate the fields. Crops withered before they matured. Too much sunshine and too little water had long been the farmers' suffering. Only in the Soviet era did the Armenian people change their fate and be proud of the sunshine in their homeland.
    Now, natural disasters have disappeared with the years of devastation. They have victoriously built the largest Sevan Lake Hydroelectric Power Station in the country, allowing spring to reside in the branches and treetops, and in the heart of every Armenian.
    We set off from Yerevan by car, driving north along the highway. Sometimes the highway runs parallel to the Hrazdan River, and we can clearly hear the gurgling of the water; sometimes it leaves the river and enters the dense shade of the trees, and then the sound of birds replaces the sound of water. Lake Sevan is sixty kilometers from Yerevan, and the lake surface is one thousand meters higher than the city. The highway is carved along the contours of the mountain slopes, winding northwards, getting higher and higher. On the way, we passed the Artsni Sanatorium, where we took a short rest and drank the local mineral water. The car continued to move forward, and soon we arrived at the shore of Lake Sevan - the Lake Sevan, known as the "largest among the high lakes and the highest among the large lakes" in the world.
    After getting off the car, the shimmering waves greeted us, and an endless expanse of transparent blue entered our eyes, making us feel refreshed. I took a light breath and started walking along the lakeshore. Originally, Lake Sevan has an area of about 1,400 square kilometers, a length of 72 kilometers, and a maximum width of 39 kilometers. It has two lake surfaces, a large lake with a depth of 50 meters and a small lake with a depth of 100 meters, surrounded by stone mountains that extend to the distant horizon. The lake is in the middle of the depression, forming a rock trough. It receives the water volume injected by 28 rivers, up to 43 billion cubic meters, but there is only one outlet, which is the Hrazdan River. More water flows in than flows out, and most of it is evaporated. At least one billion cubic meters of water returns to the clouds in the high sky every year.
    "This cannot be allowed!" said a Soviet comrade who accompanied us. "All natural forces should benefit mankind, and we cannot let it be wasted in vain. This is what we Soviet people have to do."
    Since 1930, they have started this plan to conquer nature, which is carried out in two stages. The task of the first stage is to build a large power station on the shore of Lake Sevan to utilize the existing lake water; in the second stage, all eight power stations along the Hrazdan River will be mobilized to gradually reduce the lake, reduce its evaporation surface, and keep the lake water at a certain reserve. Now the construction of the second stage is also nearing completion, but when we stand on the shore of Lake Sevan, the distant mountains, the chalk on the shore, the nearby villages, the forests, the broken slopes, everything is in front of us, but we don't see any power station.
      "It's right here." The Soviet comrade pointed to a piece of ground covered with green grass, and explained knowingly, "The entrance is over there!"
    We followed him to a not-so-large house. Not far from the entrance, there is a rather steep tunnel with elevator equipment installed next to it. In order to let the guests understand the depth of this tunnel, the Soviet comrade suggested that everyone walk down the steps. As I walked, I silently counted. The whole journey was 354 steps. If it was going up to the sky instead of entering the ground, it would probably have climbed a 16-story building. However, we are now 60 meters deep underground, and we were led into a spacious, bright hall with good ventilation.
      "The power station is slightly lower than the bottom of the large lake and slightly higher than the bottom of the small lake," an Armenian comrade who looked like an engineer explained to us, with a smiling shadow flickering in his dark eyes under long eyelashes. He led us forward and continued, "In this way, after 50 years, the large lake will dry up, leaving only the small lake. The lake water will maintain a fixed reserve, and the power station will continue to work normally."
    We entered the next room, which is the machine room. Various sizes of pipes are crisscrossed, and huge turbines are working. The sound of rushing water is rolling around.
    "This is the regulator." The engineer led us through a spiral iron ladder, pointing to a very complicated machine and saying. Then we went to another room and visited the generator. Next to it was a smaller machine, which, according to the explanation, can replace the power generation when the generator is being repaired, so as not to affect the work of the entire station.
    We asked the engineer about the power generation.
    "Now we can provide 4 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity every year," he replied. "The seventh power station on the Hrazdan River is under construction, and this number will continue to increase. You know, hydropower stations not only bring light to the Armenian people and support industrial production, but also solve the problem of agricultural water. The original flow rate of the river water was 6 cubic meters per second, and now it has increased to 33 cubic meters per second, which irrigates more than 200,000 hectares of land in the Ararat Basin."
    "How many people work here?"
    "Five workers are on duty each time."
    "Five?" We exclaimed in unison. In such a huge power station, only five people work. Everyone doubted their ears.
      "Five." The engineer replied affirmatively. "They are just here to take care of it, because everything is automated and controlled by electricity. The control room is built on the ground, and the commander-in-chief is in Yerevan, sixty kilometers away. If the machine has an obstacle or an accident, the city will know. We can work very well with very little manpower."
    This answer aroused great interest among us, and everyone discussed it lively. The engineer saw this.
      "Expanding industrial automation is a consistent goal of the entire Soviet Union, not just here," he said as he walked. "The Party called on industrial workers across the country in mid-May to increase the quantity and quality of industrial production and strive for no backward industrial sectors. Our method is to launch socialist competitions, create advanced experiences, improve production organization, and at the same time, manufacturing new machines to strengthen industrial automation is also one of the main projects. In the Soviet Union, science always serves the working people."
    He probably thought of his own profession, and seemed particularly relaxed and happy.
    "This is a characteristic of socialist countries," my companion agreed.
    "The more we move forward, the better life will be. We are moving towards communism," the engineer added, nodding.
    We walked to the front of an iron gate, which is the end of the underground power station. After bypassing the iron gate, everyone stood on a large stone slab, and the lake water poured out from under the stone slab and flowed to a large tunnel below. It jumped, shouted, and rolled. The tunnel is two or three zhang lower than the large stone slab, like a man-made waterfall, and we are standing on the top of the waterfall.
    I told the engineer this feeling.
      "You think right." The sturdy Armenian said, his eyes twinkling with a smile again, "Our hydropower station is also called the Sevan Sangar Waterfall. The lake water has to flow for five and a half kilometers in the artificially excavated underground riverbed before it can see the sun. After that, it is the Hrazdan River you know, which brings a good harvest to the farmers."
    We returned to the ground by elevator, visited the control room under the guidance of the engineer, and then walked slowly along the lakeshore. The color of Lake Sevan changed from blue to green, but it was still so clear. According to the Soviet comrades, it can change several colors in a day with the change of weather, and the water produces delicious mountain trout. In the center of the lake, there is a steep stone island. Due to the drop in water level, it has now become a peninsula. A long, narrow embankment connects the lakeshore and the stone island. There is a temple built in 306 AD.
    We walked from the embankment all the way to the island.
    There is a story circulating among the Armenian people: a long, long time ago, the Arabs invaded, and the king of Urartu fled to the island. The enemy pressed forward step by step, chasing all the way to the lake. The king and the islanders stood up and prepared for the last battle. At this time, the sun slowly rose from behind, and the lake water changed color in an instant, and the golden light shone, and the enemy suspected that there were divine soldiers to help, and was so frightened that he was at a loss, so he quietly retreated.
    Sunshine, lake water, endless passionate praise of the Armenian people.
    I stood on the top of the island, looking around the sky and water, the scenery is picturesque. I silently thought in my heart: all legends are very beautiful, but it is the ideal and strength of the Soviet people that give this legend a realistic proof.

　　谢凡湖畔
　　——记谢凡湖地下水力发电站
　　唐弢
    苏联同志们一提到亚美尼亚，惯常喜欢加上一个形容词：我们的阳光普照的亚美尼亚。这个位置在亚热带上的加盟共和国，阳光的确是她重要的宝藏，一年四季，它给葡萄园、果园、麦田、棉田、甜菜田和橄榄树带来了丰饶的收获，牲畜在阳光底下长大，葡萄酒在阳光底下发酵，生活在阳光底下走向幸福和富足。几乎没有一个角落、没有一件东西不沾染了柔和的阳光。傍晚时候，我们站到首都埃里温的卡那凯尔高地上，纵目远眺，拉斯丹河从高原奔腾而下，翻起一堆堆耀眼的浪花；阿拉拉特和阿拉格兹南北对峙，终年积雪的峰顶给蓝天涂上一抹稀有的白色；峡谷里的丛林，草原上的羊群，以及用凝灰岩、玄武石和花岗石筑成的城市里的房屋，静静地沐浴在阳光里。由于空气稀薄，看上去是那么透剔，明丽，洁净，仿佛一尘不染，我们来到了人间少有的仙境。
    仙境座落在拔海平均一千公尺的高原上，扼住了地中海、近东与中亚细亚的通道。亚美尼亚的历史一直可以追溯到二千五百年以前。许多世纪来，这个民族抵抗了罗马人、阿拉伯人、波斯人、土耳其人和蒙古汗的侵略，饱尝了战争的痛苦。饥饿和灾害也没有放过他们。革命以前，高原上同样有充足的阳光，可是湖泊受到太阳的蒸发，没有被利用来灌溉田地，农作物在尚未成熟之前就枯萎了，太多的阳光和太少的水分，长期以来构成了农民们的苦恼。只有在苏维埃年代里，亚美尼亚人才改变了命运，为自己国土里的阳光普照而骄傲。
    现在，自然灾害随着被蹂躏的年月消逝了，他们已经胜利地建设了全国最大的谢凡湖水力发电站，让春天长驻在枝头树梢，在每一个亚美尼亚人的心里。
    我们从埃里温坐汽车出发，沿着公路北驶，公路有时与拉斯丹河并行，可以清晰地听到潺潺水声；有时却离开河道，进入茂密的林荫，于是鸟声代替了水声。谢凡湖离埃里温六十公里，湖面比城厢高出一千公尺，公路是随着山坡的形势开凿的，蜿蜒北进，愈走愈高。中途经过阿尔茨尼疗养院，在那里稍事休息，喝了当地的矿泉水，车子又继续前进，不久就到了谢凡湖边——这个被称为全世界“高湖里最大、大湖里最高”的谢凡湖。
    下了车，波光迎面，一片无边的透明的青色映入眼帘，使人精神为之一爽。我轻轻地舒了口气，沿着湖滨散起步来。原来谢凡湖面积约一千四百平方公里，长达七十二公里，最阔的地方三十九公里，有大小两个湖面，大湖深五十公尺，小湖深一百公尺，周围石山环抱，一直伸展到很远的天边。湖泊就在中间的凹地里，形成一个岩石槽子。它承受了二十八条河流注入的水量，多到四百三十亿立方公尺，可是出路却只有一条，这就是拉斯丹河。湖水流入的多，流出的少，大部分是被蒸发了，一年之间，至少有十亿立方公尺的水回到了高空的云层。
    “这是不能被允许的！”陪我们同去的一位苏联同志说，“一切自然力量都应该造福人群，不能够让它白白地浪费掉。这就是我们苏维埃人要做的工作。”
    打从1930年起，他们就开始了这一征服自然的计划，前后分两个阶段进行。第一个阶段的任务是，在谢凡湖畔建立一个大型发电站，将现有的湖水加以利用；到了第二个阶段，拉斯丹河沿岸的八个发电站全部行动起来，逐渐地把湖泊缩小，减少它的蒸发面，使湖水保持一定的储量。现在第二个阶段的建设也已经接近完成了，可是，当我们站在谢凡湖畔的时候，远处的群山，沿岸的白垩，附近的村落，丛林，断坡，一切都在眼前，却没有看到什么发电站。
      “就在这里。”苏联同志手指一块长满青草的地面，会意地解释，“那边就是入口处了！”
    我们跟着他走近一座并不太大的房屋，进门不远，有一个相当陡峭的隧道，旁边装着电梯设备。为了要使客人们了解这个隧道的深度，苏联同志建议大家拾级而下。我一面走，一面默默地数着，全程三百五十四级，如果不是入地而是上天的话，大概已经攀登了一个十六层高的大楼。可是，我们现在却深入地底六十公尺，被引入了一个宽敞、明亮、有着很好通风设备的大厅里。
      “发电站是在比大湖的底稍低、比小湖的底略高的地方，”一个工程师模样的亚美尼亚同志向我们讲解，长睫毛下乌黑的大眼珠闪动着笑影。他一面领着我们往前走，一面继续说，“这样，五十年后大湖干涸了，只剩下小湖，湖水保持着固定的储量，发电站将继续正常地工作。”
    我们进入邻室，这里是机器房。各种大小管子纵横相架，硕大无朋的透平机正在工作。四周翻滚着奔腾的水声。
    “这是调节器。”工程师领我们走过了一道螺旋形的铁梯，指着一架看起来十分复杂的机器说。然后我们又到了另一个房间，参观了发电机，旁边放着一架较小的机器，据解释，当发电机进行修理时，可以由它来代替发电，不至于影响全站的工作。
    我们向工程师提出发电量的问题。
    “现在每年可以提供四十亿瓩的电力。”他回答说，“拉斯丹河上第七个发电站正在建设，这个数字将继续增加。你们知道，水电站不仅给亚美尼亚人民带来光明，支持了工业生产，也解决了农业用水的问题，河水的原来流速是每秒钟六立方公尺，目前已经增加到每秒钟三十三立方公尺，它灌溉了阿拉拉特盆地上二十多万公顷的土地。”
    “有多少人在这里工作？”
    “每次五个工人值班。”
    “五个？”我们不约而同地惊叫起来。在这样规模巨大的发电站里，只有五个人工作，大家都怀疑着自己的耳朵。
      “五个。”工程师肯定地回答。“他们只是在这里照料一下，因为一切都是自动化的，通过电力操纵。操纵室建筑在地面上，总指挥远在六十公里以外的埃里温城里，机器发生障碍，出了什么事故，城里全都知道。我们只要用很少的人力，就可以工作得满好。”
    这个回答引起了我们很大的兴趣，大家七嘴八舌地议论起来。工程师看出了这一点。
      “扩大工业自动化是全苏联一致努力的目标，不仅仅我们这里如此。”他一面走，一面往下说，“党在5月中旬号召全国工业工作人员提高工业生产的数量和质量，争取没有一个落后的工业部门。我们的办法是展开社会主义竞赛，创造先进经验，改进生产组织，同时，制造新机器来加强工业自动化，也是主要的项目之一。在苏联，科学总是为劳动人民服务的。”
    他大概想到了自己的职业，显得分外的轻松和愉快。
    “这是社会主义国家的特点。”我的同伴表示同意。
    “愈往前走，生活将愈是美好，我们正在向共产主义迈进哩。”工程师又点头补充。
    我们走到了一个铁栅的前面，这是地下发电站的尽头。绕过铁栅，大家站到一块大石板上，湖水就从石板底下倾泻出来，向着下面一个大隧道流去，它跳着，叫着，翻滚着。隧道比大石板低下两三丈，活像一道人工开凿的瀑布，而我们就站在瀑布的头上。
    我把这个感觉告诉了工程师。
      “你想得不错。”这个结实的亚美尼亚人说，他的眼角又泛起笑意，“我们的水电站也叫谢凡·桑加瀑布。湖水要在人工开凿的地下河床里流五公里半，才能见到太阳，以后，便是你们知道的拉斯丹河，它给农民们带去丰收。”
    我们乘电梯回到地面，在工程师引导下参观了操纵室，然后沿着湖滨缓步走去。谢凡湖的水色由青转碧，但还是那么澄清，据苏联同志告诉我们，随着天气的转变，它一天能变幻出几种颜色，水里出产鲜美的山鳟。湖中心，矗立着一个峻峭的石岛，由于水位降低，现在已成为半岛，一条狭长的平堤把湖岸和石岛衔接起来。那里有一座公元306年建筑的庙宇。
    我们从平堤一直走到岛上。
    亚美尼亚民间流传着一个故事：很久很久以前，阿拉伯人入侵，乌拉尔图国王逃到岛上，敌人步步进逼，一直追到湖边。国王和岛民挺身而出，准备作最后一次决战。这时候，太阳缓缓地从背后升起，湖水转瞬间变了颜色，金光辉映，敌人疑有神兵相助，吓得惊惶失措，便悄悄地回马撤退了。
    阳光，湖水，听不完的亚美尼亚人的热情的歌颂。
    我站立在岛顶，四顾水天，景色如画。心里默默地想着：一切传说都很美丽，而给这传说以现实的印证的，却是苏维埃人的理想和力量。
