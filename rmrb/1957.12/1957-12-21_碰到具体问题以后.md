    After Encountering Specific Problems
    Chen Ji
    One day, the uprights of two large steam hammers in the machinist section of the forging workshop of the First Automobile Factory were damaged and needed to be dismantled for repair. In the past, the machinist section often repaired equipment, but had never repaired the uprights of such large steam hammers. Now it was also the time of the rectification campaign, and everyone was stepping up production and also busy with the socialist great debate, so how to repair these two large steam hammers quickly was really a difficult problem to solve. After discussing it, machinist Sun and foreman Lu felt that the machinist section could repair one large steam hammer; repairing two large steam hammers was unlikely. So they made a decision: to hand over one two-ton large steam hammer to the machine repair shop for repair. The machine repair shop accepted the task and planned to repair it in half a month.
    Machinist Sun and foreman Lu quickly solved this problem and were both very happy, believing that the workers would also be happy. Because in the past, when equipment broke down, the workers had reported it several times, but it could not be dealt with quickly; now, as soon as a problem occurred with the large steam hammer, it was immediately resolved, which was also a new change after the rectification campaign.
    However, no one expected that when the workers learned about this, they were not very satisfied. They said, "Why should we ask the machine repair shop to repair something we can repair ourselves? It increases their troubles!" Foreman Lu explained, "We are busy with work, and we have never repaired such a large steam hammer before, so I am afraid we will not be able to repair it in a short time." "Who says we can't repair it in a short time? If you have difficulties, why don't you consult with the workers?" Old worker Yang Jing-shan said angrily, "You, once you encounter specific problems, you don't follow the mass line!"
    When Zhang, the secretary of the Party's general branch in the forging workshop, heard the workers' opinions, he immediately called a meeting of workers, machinists, and foremen to discuss the problem. The workers all advocated repairing it themselves. After the meeting, it only took six days to repair the two large steam hammers.
    The rectification movement has helped many people learn to follow the mass line. However, to deeply instill the mass line into everyone's minds and turn it into concrete action is still a very arduous task.

    碰到具体问题以后
    陈迹
    有一天，第一汽车厂锻工车间机械师工部的两个大汽锤的立柱都坏了，需要拆下来修理。过去机械师工部常常检修设备，但是没有修理过这么大的汽锤的立柱。现在又是整风的时候，大家都在加紧生产，又忙于社会主义大辩论，怎么能很快修好这两个大汽锤，真是个难以解决的问题。孙机械师和陆工长商量了一番，觉得机械师工部修理一个大汽锤还可以；修理两个大汽锤却不大可能。他们于是做出决定：把一个两吨重的大汽锤交给机修车间修理。机修车间接受了这个任务，计划用半个月时间修好。
    孙机械师和陆工长很快解决了这个问题，都感到很高兴，一心以为工人们也会很高兴。因为过去设备坏了，工人们反映好几次，还不能很快处理；现在大汽锤刚刚出问题，就马上解决，这也是整风以后的一种新变化。
    但是，谁也没有想到：工人们知道了这件事，却不大满意。他们说：“咱们能修理的东西，为啥找机修车间修？增加人家的麻烦？”陆工长解释道：“咱们工作忙，又没修过这样大的汽锤，恐怕一时修不好。”“谁说咱们一时修不好？你们有困难，为啥不找工人商量？”老工人杨井山气愤地说：“你们呀，一碰到具体问题，就不走群众路线啦！”
    锻工车间党总支张书记听到工人们的意见，连忙召集工人、机械师和工长一起开会，讨论这个问题。工人们都主张自己修。会后，只用了六天时间，就把两个大汽锤修好了。
    整风运动帮助很多人学会了走群众路线。但是，要把群众路线深入到每个人的脑子里去，变成具体的行动，还是个十分艰巨的任务呢。
