Further Promote the Policy of Running a Household Thriftily

Universally advocating thrift in households in both urban and rural areas is an extremely important aspect of implementing the policy of building the country and running cooperatives thriftily. Currently, more than ten provinces and cities across the country have conscientiously implemented the policy of running households thriftily in key areas, achieving results and creating preliminary experiences.

However, advocating thrift in households across the country is still a relatively new endeavor. Most places have only started with key publicity and have not yet fully expanded it, or they have only made general calls without integrating them with the production and lives of the masses. Therefore, it is still necessary to further promote it vigorously on the existing foundation, closely integrated with the current central tasks.

According to the experience of key areas, to promote the policy of running households thriftily, it is first necessary to make cadres and the masses see the huge potential of diligence and frugality. In recent years, especially after the completion of agricultural cooperativization, agricultural production has developed rapidly, and the lives of farmers have improved significantly. In 1956, the grain consumed and stored by farmers increased by more than 110 billion jin compared to 1949. In 1956, the cloth supplied to farmers by the state increased by two times compared to 1950. According to many investigation materials, except for a few well-to-do middle peasants and "five guarantees" households, the income of the original middle peasants, poor peasants, and farm laborers has generally increased significantly compared to before the War of Resistance Against Japan. For example, among the 198 cooperative members in Huangyan Village, Huolu County, Hebei Province, the cooperative members whose family component was originally middle peasant had an average income of 74 yuan per person in 1956, an increase of 54% compared to the average income of 48 yuan in 1936. The cooperative members who were originally poor peasants had an average income of 67 yuan per person in 1956, an increase of 91% compared to the average income of 35 yuan in 1936. The cooperative members who were originally farm laborers had an average income of 68 yuan per person in 1956, an increase of 119% compared to the average income of 31 yuan in 1936. Now, in the countryside, everyone is truly eating their fill and everyone has new clothes.

The working people of our country have always had the fine tradition of diligence and frugality. In the old society, because there was a system of exploitation where people ate people, even if they saved on food and expenses, the vast majority of farmers could not avoid poverty and bankruptcy, and even family ruin. Now, running households thriftily is being carried out on the basis of the basic completion of China's socialist revolution, the great achievements of socialist construction, the rapid development of production, the increase in people's income, and the improvement of people's lives. Therefore, as long as in-depth publicity and education are carried out, the broad masses of people will certainly be more willing to be diligent and frugal.

According to the experience of key areas, to promote thrift in households, it is necessary to mention running households thriftily together with building the country thriftily and running cooperatives thriftily, and carry out comprehensive publicity. It is necessary to help the people understand the principle of running households thriftily along with running cooperatives thriftily, and to unify the three things of loving the country, loving the cooperative, and loving the family ideologically; to make everyone understand that true love for the family must first love the country and love the cooperative; to think about the interests of the country and the cooperative is to think about the long-term and fundamental interests of the family. Now, some people do not pay attention to saving because the ideas of loving the country, loving the cooperative, and loving the family have not been established. Some people say: in the past, saving on food and expenses was to buy land to pass on to future generations. Now that the land belongs to the cooperative, they can ask for the "five guarantees" when they are old, they can ask for subsidies when they are sick, and they can ask for relief in famine years. Everything is taken care of by the cooperative. Some people only care about eating and drinking, and spend lavishly after the distribution of dividends. This kind of thinking and practice that only cares about the present and only cares about personal interests is obviously wrong. China has a population of 600 million. If one person spends one yuan more per year to buy grain, the state will need to increase the supply of 6 billion jin of grain. If one person spends one yuan more per year to buy cloth, the state will need to increase the supply of 20 million bolts of cotton cloth. It is a small matter for one person to spend one yuan more, but the state and the cooperative will have to increase the supply of a large amount of materials because of this. Moreover, excessive eating and spending, eating up all or most of what is produced now, without considering increasing accumulation and expanding reproduction, is not only detrimental to the interests of the country and the cooperative, but also not good for oneself. Those who indulge in overeating and spending live a life of "three days of wealth, half a month of poverty" because they have no long-term plans.

All localities should combine with the current socialist debate and consciously regard the issue of running households thriftily as one of the important contents of the debate, fully presenting the facts, reasoning, and distinguishing right from wrong. This is the most important method for raising the understanding of men and women farmers on running households thriftily. In order to take care of the actual situation of women masses who manage household affairs and their level of awareness, in addition to mobilizing them to participate in debates, small forums, experience exchange meetings, representatives of thriftily run households, thriftily run household exhibitions, etc. should also be held. In particular, the opportunities on the fields and at the millstones should be used to publicize the significance and experience of running households thriftily anytime and anywhere through a variety of simple methods suitable for women's activities.

Local experiences have proved that when implementing the policy of running households thriftily, efforts should be made in three aspects: diligent production, strict economy, and planned household expenses. Some people think that running households thriftily means lowering the standard of living. This is a complete misunderstanding. What we mean by running households thriftily is to be both diligent and frugal, and to oppose idleness and extravagance. The first way to run households thriftily in rural areas is to ensure and support family members to actively participate in the agricultural and sideline production of the cooperative, because only by participating in the agricultural and sideline production of the cooperative and increasing the wealth of the cooperative is the fundamental source of wealth and happiness for farmer families. Household sideline production is the most suitable labor for women to participate in, and should be actively developed according to local conditions at the time, and is even more important in mountainous areas. As long as this kind of production is carried out with leadership and planning, it can create wealth for the country and the cooperative, and increase income for the family. Practicing strict economy is the most important link in running a household thriftily. Although China's socialist construction has already laid a preliminary foundation, because we have a thin foundation and a large population, there are still many difficulties in the process of construction, and the people of the whole country must work hard and practice diligence and thrift. We must pay special attention to saving grain, feed, cotton cloth, coal, etc., and we must change the old and unreasonable customs and habits. Festivals, weddings and funerals, and social events should all be simplified. Now that the country's production is carried out in a planned way, and the main materials are supplied in a planned way, every family should make long-term plans and arrange household expenses in a planned way. Major consumer goods and other expenses should be carefully calculated and arranged according to the national supply plan and the conditions of their own families.

Running a household thriftily is the responsibility of everyone. Every family, men, women, old and young, should work together. And women are the housekeepers, in charge of the consumption of firewood, rice, oil and salt, and the planning of food, clothing, housing and transportation, so women are the main force in promoting thrift, with particularly heavy responsibilities. Running a household thriftily is a practical action for women to build the country thriftily. Every woman's thrift in the household can make a huge contribution to national construction. Engaging in housework and participating in social labor are equally glorious. Housework is indispensable to socialist construction; any thought that despises housework and despises running households thriftily is completely wrong. In order to develop a social atmosphere of thrift, children should be guided to understand the meaning of running households thriftily and learn the skills of running households thriftily. The younger generation grew up in the new China and have lived a happy life with food and clothing for several years, and do not understand the difficulties of life, so they must be patiently educated and helped to inherit and carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and thrift of the working people. All working cadres, Communist Party members, and Communist Youth League members should take the lead, lead the masses, and establish the atmosphere of diligence and thrift universally and firmly. For the family members of cadres, employees, and officers who return to their hometowns, they should be encouraged to set an example in diligent production and hard work.

Chairman Mao instructed us: "In order to solve the problem of running a household thriftily, we must especially rely on women's organizations to do the work." Therefore, the women's federations at all levels have a major responsibility in publicizing and implementing the policy of running households thriftily. Now many local women's federations are taking the initiative to actively and systematically carry out this work. It is hoped that women's federations and all women cadres throughout the country will muster their energy, and under the unified leadership of the local party committees, work together with the Communist Youth League, relevant people's organizations and relevant propaganda organs. The party committee's attention and leadership are the decisive factors for carrying out the work of running households thriftily widely and in depth. Therefore, we hope that the party committees at all levels will further strengthen leadership, combine with the current rectification movement and central work, mobilize the broad masses of men and women to consciously, willingly, and happily manage their households thriftily, fully tap the potential of family diligence and frugality, and strive to promote the great leap forward in agricultural production and strengthen socialist industrialization.

### 进一步推行勤俭持家的方针

　　进一步推行勤俭持家的方针
    在城市和农村里普遍提倡勤俭持家，是贯彻执行勤俭建国、勤俭办社方针的极重要的方面。目前，全国已有十多个省、市在重点地区认真贯彻执行了勤俭持家的方针，取得了成绩，创造了初步的经验。
    但是，在全国提倡勤俭持家，为时尚短，大部分地方只开始了重点宣传，还没有全面铺开；或者，只作了一般的号召，还没有同群众的生产和生活结合起来。因此，还必须在现有的基础上，紧密地结合当前的中心工作，进一步大力推行。
    根据重点地区的经验，要推行勤俭持家的方针，首先必须使干部和群众看到勤俭节约的巨大潜力。近几年来，特别是农业合作化完成之后，农业生产有了迅速的发展，农民生活有了显著的改善。1956年农民食用和储备的粮食，比1949年增加了一千一百多亿斤；1956年国家供应给农民的布匹比1950年增加了两倍。从许多调查材料来看，除去少数富裕中农和“五保”户以外，原来的中农、贫农、雇农的收入，一般都比抗战前有显著的增加。例如河北省获鹿县黄岩村的一百九十八户社员中，家庭成分原是中农的社员，1956年平均每人收入七十四元，比1936年平均收入四十八元，增加了54％。原是贫农的社员，1956年平均每人收入六十七元，比1936年平均收入三十五元增加了91％。原是雇农的社员，1956年平均每人收入六十八元，比1936年平均收入三十一元提高了119％。现在农村里，真是人人吃饱饭，个个有新衣。
    我国劳动人民从来就有勤劳节俭的优良传统。在旧社会里，因为存在着人吃人的剥削制度，即使省吃俭用，绝大多数农民还免不了要贫穷破产，甚至家破人亡。现在勤俭持家，是在我国社会主义革命基本完成、社会主义建设取得巨大成就、生产获得迅速发展、人民收入增加、人民生活改善的基础上进行的，因此，只要进行深入的宣传教育，广大人民一定更加愿意勤劳节俭。
    根据重点地区的经验，要推行勤俭持家，必须把勤俭持家和勤俭建国、勤俭办社并提，全面宣传。必须帮助人民群众了解勤俭持家和勤俭办社并提的道理，把爱国、爱社、爱家三件事从思想上统一起来；使大家懂得：真正的爱家，必须首先爱国、爱社；为国家和合作社的利益着想，也就是为家庭长远的、根本的利益着想。现在有一部分人不重视节约，就是因为爱国、爱社、爱家的思想没有树立起来。有人说：过去省吃俭用，是为了买田置地传后代，现在土地归了合作社，老了可以要求五保，病了可以要求补助，荒年可以要求救济，一切有合作社在。有些人一心讲究吃穿，分红后就滥吃滥用。这种只顾眼前，只顾个人利益的想法和作法显然是不对的。全国有六亿人口，如果一个人一年多拿一块钱去买粮食，国家就需要增加六十亿斤粮食的供应，一个人一年多拿一块钱买布，国家就需要增加两千万匹棉布的供应。一个人多花一块钱是小事，但是国家和合作社就要因此增加大量的物资供应。而且滥吃滥用，把现在生产出来的东西，全部或大部吃光用光，不考虑增加积累，扩大再生产，不仅对国家和合作社的利益，就是对自己也是没有好处。那些滥吃滥用的人过“富三天，穷半月”的生活，就因为没有长远打算的缘故。
    各地应当结合目前社会主义大辩论，有意识地把勤俭持家问题当作辩论的重要内容之一，充分摆事实，讲道理，分清是非。这是提高男女农民对勤俭持家认识的最主要的方法。为了照顾妇女群众操持家务的实际情况及觉悟水平，除掉发动她们参加辩论会以外，还应该举行小型座谈会、经验交流会、勤俭持家能手代表会、勤俭持家展览会等等，特别要利用在地头、磨边的机会，通过多种多样的适合妇女活动的简便办法，把勤俭持家的意义和经验，随时随地进行宣传。
    各地经验证明，在推行勤俭持家的方针的时候，应该从勤劳生产、厉行节约、有计划地安排家务开支等三方面来努力。有些人以为勤俭持家就是要降低生活水平。这完全是误解。我们所说的勤俭持家，就是既要勤劳，又要节俭，反对游手好闲，反对铺张浪费。农村中勤俭持家的办法首先是保证和支持家庭成员积极参加合作社的农副业生产劳动，因为只有参加合作社的农副业生产，增加合作社的财富，才是农民家庭富裕幸福的根本源泉。家庭副业生产是最适于妇女参加的劳动，应该根据当时当地条件积极开展，在山区更为重要。这种生产只要有领导有计划地进行，就能为国家、合作社创造财富，为家庭增加收入。厉行节约是勤俭持家最主要的一环。我国社会主义建设虽然已经打下初步基础，但是因为我们原有的家底薄、人口多，在建设的过程中，困难还是很多的，必须全国人民艰苦奋斗、克勤克俭。我们特别要注意节约粮食、饲料、棉布、煤炭等，并且要改变旧的不合理的风俗习惯，逢年过节、红白喜事、人情应酬，一切都应当从简。现在国家生产是有计划进行的，主要物资是有计划供应的，因此每个家庭都应该做长远打算，有计划地安排家庭开支。对主要消费品和其他的开支，都要根据国家供应计划和自己家庭的条件，精打细算，加以安排。
    勤俭持家，人人有责。每一个家庭的男女老少应该一齐努力。而妇女是家务的主持者，掌握着家庭柴米油盐的消费和衣食住行的筹划，所以妇女更是推行勤俭持家的主要力量，责任特别重大。勤俭持家就是妇女勤俭建国的一种实际行动。每个妇女勤俭持家，就可以对国家建设作出巨大贡献。从事家务劳动和参加社会劳动同样是光荣的。家务劳动是社会主义建设不可缺少的；任何轻视家务劳动，轻视勤俭持家的思想，都是完全错误的。为了养成勤俭持家的社会风气，对于自己的子女，应该引导他们懂得勤俭持家的意义，学会勤俭持家的本领。青年一代是在新中国长大成人的，几年来都过着有吃有穿的幸福生活，不大懂得生活的艰难，所以要耐心地教育和帮助他们，继承并发扬劳动人民勤劳俭朴的优良传统。所有的工作干部、共产党员、共青团员，应当以身作则，带领群众，把勤劳俭朴的风气，普遍地巩固地树立起来。对于回乡的干部家属、职工家属和军官家属，应该鼓励她们在勤劳生产、艰苦朴素方面作出榜样。
    毛主席指示我们：“为了解决勤俭持家问题，特别要依靠妇女团体做工作。”所以宣传贯彻执行勤俭持家的方针，各地妇联组织有重大责任。现在不少地方妇联正在主动地积极地有计划地开展这项工作，希望全国各地妇联组织和全体妇女干部，鼓起劲来，在各地党委统一领导下，协同共青团、有关人民团体及有关宣传机关共同努力。党委的重视和领导，又是广泛深入开展勤俭持家工作的决定因素。因此，我们希望各地党委进一步加强领导，结合当前的整风运动和中心工作，动员广大男女群众，自觉自愿地、心情愉快地、克勤克俭地料理家务，充分发掘家庭勤劳节俭的潜在力量，为促进农业生产的大跃进、为加强社会主义工业化而努力奋斗。
