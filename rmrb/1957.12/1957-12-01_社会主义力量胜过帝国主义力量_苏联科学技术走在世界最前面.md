    Socialist Forces Surpass Imperialist Forces
    Soviet Science and Technology Lead the World
    Prospects for the Development of Atomic Power Stations
    Nikolaev, Deputy Director of the General Administration for the Utilization of Atomic Energy under the Soviet Council of Ministers, recently published an article in "Labor News" stating that in the next few years, the Soviet Union will build several atomic power stations with a total generating capacity of two million to two and a half million kilowatts. These include the first batch of large atomic power stations with a generating capacity of 400,000 to 600,000 kilowatts, as well as several experimental power stations with smaller generating capacities and various types of reactors.
    Nikolaev said that the Soviet Union's energy needs for the next few centuries can be fully supplied by the country's vast reserves of organic fuels and hydroelectric resources. However, even by 1975, two-thirds of the energy produced in the Soviet Union will be used to supply the European part of the Soviet Union and the Urals. Therefore, it is currently reasonable to utilize atomic energy in the European part of the Soviet Union and the Urals.
    The deputy director said that the atomic power stations to be built in the Soviet Union will use three types of reactors. The first type of reactor is similar to the reactors in existing Soviet power stations and will use modern turbines with a generating capacity of 100,000 kilowatts. The efficiency coefficient of the first type of atomic power station is very high, reaching over 35%.
    The second type of atomic power station will establish high-pressure water thermal neutron reactors, using ordinary water as a moderator and heat transfer agent. This will improve the safety of the power station during operation, and it will not be necessary to stop the reactor and power station when repairing and inspecting the basic equipment of the primary circuit. The cost of electricity is expected to be equal to the electricity generated by the best thermal power stations.
    The third type of atomic power station is very interesting. It uses a thermal neutron reactor, with heavy water as a moderator and carbon dioxide as a heat transfer agent. Since heavy water is used as a moderator, natural uranium can be used in the reactor, which is much cheaper than enriched uranium.
    Nikolaev said that in addition to power stations, the Soviet Union will build four smaller power experimental devices with reactors, which also appear to be very promising.
　  The World's First Atomic Icebreaker
    Pavel Ponomarev, the future captain of the world's first atomic icebreaker, the "Lenin," published an interview in the "Izvestia" on the 29th, introducing the upcoming icebreaker. Twenty-five years ago, Ponomarev commanded the world-renowned Soviet icebreaker "Krasin," which opened the Northern Sea Route.
    Ponomarev said: "The 'Lenin' icebreaker is the largest icebreaker in the world. The height of the ship is equal to a six- or seven-story building. It has 44,000 horsepower and can conquer ice layers more than two meters thick. It can sail continuously for more than a year without adding fuel."
    Great attention was paid to building the most comfortable equipment for the crew during shipbuilding. All necessary measures will be taken on board to ensure that all crew members are completely protected from radioactive radiation.
  　The World's Largest Radio Telescope
    Soviet Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, Haikin, announced at a conference of radio astronomers on the 29th that the Soviet Union has produced the world's largest radio telescope.
    Haikin said that the telescope is 130 meters long, and the total area of the "radio mirror" reaches 400 square meters. Dozens of powerful motors and semi-automatic control special devices are required to rotate this behemoth. This telescope can automatically record the results of observations. It can be used to study the phenomena of the ionosphere: to observe various changes in the sun and predict the occurrence of magnetic storms in the Earth's atmosphere based on these materials, and to study the structure of the universe.
    Haikin said that the new telescope greatly expands the scope of human understanding of the universe. It can receive radio waves with a wavelength of only three centimeters. The radio telescope recently installed at the Cheshire Observatory in the United Kingdom was considered one of the largest radio telescopes in the world, but the radio waves it receives are nineteen times longer than those received by the Soviet telescope. This feature of the Soviet telescope greatly improves the accuracy of observing the starry sky world in the depths of the universe hundreds of millions of light-years away, beyond the visual range of optical instruments. In the near future, we will be able to use huge radio telescopes to receive even shorter radio waves—wavelengths as short as 1.5 centimeters.
    Another Soviet scientist, Professor Basov, said that the Soviet Union is currently manufacturing radio telescopes equipped with molecular amplifiers. It can increase the range of electronic telescopes by about 50 times.
  　The World's Most Accurate Molecular Clock
    The Physics Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has produced one of the most accurate clocks in the world. This clock is called a molecular clock, and its error in one year will not exceed one ten-millionth of a second. It is much more accurate than the famous American cesium clock, but its volume is a thousand times smaller than that of a quartz astronomical clock. It can walk equally accurately under any conditions.
    The basic component of the molecular clock is a specially made high-frequency electromagnetic pulse generator. This generator can emit 240 billion vibrations per second, making time readings extremely accurate.
    Molecular clocks can help solve problems in areas such as celestial evolution and geophysics. The molecular clock can be used to unravel a natural mystery that has not yet been cracked—the subtle changes in the Earth's rotation speed around its axis, and to measure changes in strata materials with considerable precision.

### 社会主义力量胜过帝国主义力量  苏联科学技术走在世界最前面

    社会主义力量胜过帝国主义力量
    苏联科学技术走在世界最前面
    原子能发电站发展前景
    苏联部长会议利用原子能总局副局长尼古拉耶夫最近在“劳动报”上发表文章说，在最近几年中，苏联将建筑总发电能力为二百万到二百五十万瓩的一些原子能发电站。其中包括第一批发电能力为四十万到六十万瓩的大型原子能发电站以及一些发电能力不大的带有各种类型反应堆的试验发电站。
    尼古拉耶夫说，苏联在未来的若干世纪中的动力需求完全可以由国内蕴藏的大量有机燃料和水力资源来供应。但是，即使到1975年，苏联生产的能量的三分之二要供应苏联的欧洲部分和乌拉尔使用。因此，目前在苏联的欧洲部分和乌拉尔利用原子能是合理的。
    这位副局长说，苏联将建筑的原子能发电站分别使用三种类型的反应堆。第一种反应堆同苏联现有发电站的反应堆相似，将采用发电能力为十万瓩的现代化涡轮机，第一种类型的原子能发电站的有效系数很高，达35％以上。
    在第二种类型的原子能发电站里将要建立高压水热中子反应堆，用普通水作为减速剂和传热剂。这样就可以提高发电站在工作中的安全性，并且在修理和检查初级电路的基本装置的时候无须停止反应堆和发电站的工作。预计电力的成本将等于最好的火力发电站所发的电力。
    第三种类型的原子能发电站是很有趣的，它用的是热中子的反应堆，用重水作减速剂，用碳酸气作传热剂。由于用重水作减速剂，在反应堆里就可以利用天然铀，成本比浓集铀低得多。
    尼古拉耶夫说，除发电站之外，苏联将要建筑四个带有反应堆的发电能力较小的动力试验装置，这种装置看来也是很有前途的。
　  世界第一艘原子破冰船
    世界第一艘原子破冰船“列宁号”的未来船长巴维尔·波诺马烈夫在29日的“消息报”上发表了一篇谈话，介绍这艘即将下水的破冰船情况。波诺马烈夫在二十五年前曾指挥世界闻名的苏联破冰船“克拉辛号”，开辟了北海航线。
    波诺马烈夫说：“列宁号”破冰船是世界上最大的破冰船。船的高度等于一座六、七层的大厦。它具有四万四千马力，能够征服厚度两公尺以上的冰层。它可以不添加燃料而连续航行一年以上。
    造船时非常注意为船员们建造最舒适的设备。船上将采取一切必要措施来保证全体船员完全不受放射性辐射的侵害。
  　世界最大无线电望远镜
    苏联物理数学博士哈伊金29日在无线电天文学者会议上宣布，苏联已经制成了世界上最大的无线电望远镜。
    哈伊金说，这个望远镜的长度为一百三十公尺，“无线电镜面”的总面积达到四百平方公尺。要用数十个功率强大的电动机和半自动控制的特种装置才能转动这个庞然大物。这个望远镜能把观察的结果自动地记录下来。用它可以研究电离层的现象：观察太阳中的各种变化过程并根据这些材料来预测地球大气中磁爆的发生，研究宇宙的结构。
    哈伊金说，新的望远镜大大扩大了人类认识宇宙的范围。它可以接收波长只有三公分的无线电波。不久前装在英国柴郡天文台的无线电望远镜被认为是世界上最大无线电望远镜之一，但是它所接收的无线电波却要比苏联的这个望远镜收到的长十九倍。苏联望远镜的这个特点就使得观察在光学仪器视距以外的离开数亿光年的宇宙深处星空世界的正确度大大地提高了。在不久的将来，我们将能用巨大的无线电望远镜来接收更短的无线电波——波长短到一点五公分。
    另一位苏联科学家巴索夫教授说，目前苏联正在制造装有分子放大器的无线电望远镜。它能使电子望远镜的作用范围大约增大五十倍。
  　世界上最准确的分子钟
    苏联科学院物理研究所已制成一种世界上最准确的钟。这种钟称为分子钟，它在一年中的误差不会超过一千万分之一秒。它比著名的美国铯钟要准确得多，体积却比石英天文钟小一千倍。它在任何条件下都能同样准确地走。
    分子钟的基本构件是一个特制的高频率电磁脉冲发生器。这个发生器每秒钟能发出二千四百亿次振动，使时间的读数达到极端准确程度。
    分子钟能帮助解决天体演化学、地球物理学等方面问题。利用分子钟能解开一个至今尚未猜破的自然的谜——地球绕地轴自转的速度的细微变化，又能相当精确地测定地层物质的变化。
