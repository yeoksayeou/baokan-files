    A Precursor to Mechanization of Southern Paddy Fields and Small Plots
    Wuhan Manufactures Small Universal Tractor
    It can plow, harrow, till, sow, fertilize, spray pesticides, weed, transport, thresh, fell trees, and pump water; each unit costs only 1500-1600 yuan.
    Our newspaper Wuhan, December 24th (Reporter Zhang Wei) reports: The Wuhan State-owned Universal Machine Factory recently successfully trial-produced a small universal tractor. This tractor is not only suitable for cultivation in large and small areas of dry land in northern China, but also particularly suitable for cultivation in small plains, hilly areas, and general mountainous paddy fields in southern China. This solves the problem that large tractors cannot be used in paddy fields and small areas of land in southern China.
    This tractor is called "universal" because it comes with more than a dozen attachments (such as the No. 20 moldboard plow, ten-disc harrow, five-row fertilizer seeder, cultivator weeder, duster, paddy field plow, paddy field rotary harrow, paddy field toothed harrow, saw-wood-mow grass combination device, and transport trailer, etc.), which can adapt to a variety of rural operations: plowing, harrowing, tilling, sowing, fertilizing, spraying pesticides, cultivating, weeding, transporting, threshing, felling trees, and pumping water. The working efficiency and quality of each of its attachments are also very good. For example, the No. 20 moldboard plow can cultivate 1.2 mu per hour, with a depth of 150 to 170 mm and a width of 200 mm; the five-row fertilizer seeder has a workload of 5 mu per hour, with a row spacing of 150 mm; the five-tooth cultivator weeder can weed 2,000 square meters per hour; the light trailer has a load capacity of 600 to 700 kg; the paddy field plow can plow 1,000 square meters per hour, with a depth of 150 mm. The attachments are also very simple to use. The tractor's power is provided by a small horizontal diesel engine of 3 to 4 horsepower, which consumes 1.9 liters of diesel per hour.
    The small universal tractor is lightweight and flexible. The distance between its two rubber flower wheels can be freely adjusted according to needs, large or small, and can be adjusted to a minimum of about 50 cm, so that it can travel on field paths. This tractor is very simple to operate, and ordinary women and elderly people can drive it.
    The materials used by the Universal Machine Factory to manufacture the small universal tractor are all domestically produced ordinary steel. Its cost is only about 1,500 to 1,600 yuan, which most agricultural cooperatives can afford. If, in the future, mechanical production replaces the current manual production, and compressed biogas in bottles replaces diesel as the power fuel, its cost will be even lower, and its quality and production efficiency will be greatly improved.
    The trial production of the small universal tractor began in 1956 when the leaders of the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industries and some machinery factories returned from visiting a Japanese commodity exhibition in Shanghai. Yu Zhian, deputy director of the Universal Machine Factory, and others saw a small Japanese tractor at the exhibition and thought that if a similar small tractor could be trial-produced according to the characteristics of the rural areas in southern China, it would greatly promote the mechanization of agriculture in China. They obtained an advertising picture with only the outline of the tractor at the exhibition. After returning to the factory, with the consent of the factory leadership, the task of trial-producing the small universal tractor, along with this only reference material, was handed over to Huang Min and others, who were technicians of worker origin and had not attended university. Huang Min and others carefully studied the structure of the machine on the advertising picture at night and on Sundays, and initially drew up a design sketch. After more than a year of continuous research and trial production, and with reference to materials from countries such as Czechoslovakia, Thailand, and Germany, the small universal tractor was finally successfully trial-produced in December 1957.
    When the Hubei Provincial Party Committee convened a meeting of commissioners and mayors, it allowed the factory to take the initial trial-produced tractor for a demonstration. In the on-site cultivation experiment, it was very popular with farmers and rural cadres.
    Currently, the factory is continuing to research how to enable this tractor to transplant rice seedlings and harvest crops, and further reduce costs.

    南方水田和小块土地机械化的先声
    武汉制成小型万能拖拉机
    它可以犁田、耙田、碎土、播种、施肥、喷药、除草、运输、脱谷、伐木、抽水；每台成本只要一千五六百元。
    本报武汉24日电　记者张碨报道：武汉市国营通用机器厂最近试制成功一种小型万能拖拉机。这种拖拉机不仅适合我国北方大、小面积旱地的耕作，还特别适合我国南方小块平原、丘陵地带和一般山区水田的耕作。这就解决了我国南方水田和小块面积土地不能使用大型拖拉机的问题。
    这种拖拉机所以称为“万能”是因为它带有十多种附件（如二十号铧犁、十碟圆盘耙，五行施肥播种机、中耕除草器、喷粉器、水田犁、水田轮耙、水田丁齿耙、锯木割草联合器以及运输拖车等），可以适应农村多种多样的作业：犁田、耙田、碎土、播种、施肥、喷药撒粉、中耕除草、运输、脱谷、伐木、抽水等。它的每个附件的工作效率和工作质量也很好。例如，二十号铧犁每小时能耕一点二亩，深达一百五十到一百七十公厘，宽达二百公厘；五行施肥播种机，每小时工作量为五亩，行距一百五十公厘；五齿中耕除草器每小时能除草二千平方公尺；轻便拖车的载重量达六百到七百公斤；水田犁每小时能犁一千平方公尺，深达一百五十公厘。附件的使用也很简单。这种拖拉机的动力采用的是三至四马力的小型卧式柴油机，每小时耗柴油一点九公升。
    小型万能拖拉机具有轻便、灵巧的特点。它的两个橡胶花轮之间的距离可以根据需要自由调节，能大能小，最小能调节到五十公分左右，可以在田间小路行走。这种拖拉机操作很简单，一般妇女和老年人都能够驾驶。
    通用机器厂制造小型万能拖拉机所使用的材料，全是我国自产的普通钢材。它的成本大约只有一千五、六百元，一般农业社都能买得起。如果将来用机械代替目前的手工生产，动力燃料用压缩在瓶内的沼气代替柴油，它的成本将更会低廉，它的质量和生产效率将会大大提高。
    小型万能拖拉机的试制，是从1956年武汉市机电工业局和一些机械工厂负责人到上海参观日本商品展览会回来开始的。通用机器厂的副厂长于志安等在展览会上看到一种日本的小型拖拉机，联想到如果能根据我国南方农村的特点试制一种类似的小型拖拉机，对于促进我国农业的机械化将有很大作用。他们在展览会上索得了一张仅有个拖拉机外形轮廓的广告图片。回厂之后，经厂部研究同意，就把试制小型万能拖拉机的任务，连同这唯一的参考资料交给了工人出身的没有上过大学的技术人员黄敏等人。黄敏等利用晚上和星期日细心研究广告图片上机器的构造，初步绘出一张设计草图。经过一年多的不断研究和试制，并参考了捷、泰、德等国家的资料，终于在1957年12月间把小型万能拖拉机试制成功了。
    中共湖北省委在召开专员、市长会议时，曾让这个厂把初步试制成功的拖拉机开去表演。在实地耕作试验中，深受农民和农村干部的欢迎。
    目前，这个厂正在继续研究，使这种拖拉机能插秧、收割，并进一步降低成本。
