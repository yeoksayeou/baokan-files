　　工会积极分子队伍不断壮大
    几年来，各地工会组织广泛吸收了积极分子参加工会工作，工会积极分子的队伍，不断巩固和扩大。目前，全国工会组织已拥有三百八十九万名积极分子，比1953年增加了87.23％。他们分布在全国十五万七千多个基层组织中，同广大职工群众一起劳动，一起生活，并在十万多个各种工作委员会和一百四十一万个工会小组中进行工会的各项活动。工会积极分子已经形成一支工会实现自己任务的骨干力量，工会通过他们同群众保持了血肉联系。
    工会“七大”以来，全国工会组织在培养和训练工会专业干部和积极分子方面，进行了很多工作。在各省、市和各产业工会组织举办的工会干部学校和训练班中毕业的工会干部，有十六万九千多人；在短期工会业务训练班毕业的有五十八万七千多人。此外，工会基层组织还通过短期工会业务训练班、工会业务讲座等，训练了二百零六万六千多名积极分子。
