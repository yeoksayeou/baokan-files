The number of College Students with Worker-Peasant Backgrounds Increases Annually
Worker-Peasant Students Accounted for 44% of New Students Enrolled in 1957

(By Our Newspaper) Our country's higher education has achieved preliminary success in implementing the class line and adhering to the policy of opening doors to workers and peasants.

With the rapid development of higher education in our country, the number of students with worker-peasant backgrounds and from worker-peasant families in colleges and universities has increased rapidly year by year. According to statistics, in the 1951-1952 academic year, students with worker-peasant backgrounds accounted for only 19.08% of the total number of students in colleges and universities across the country. By the 1956-1957 academic year, students with worker-peasant backgrounds had reached 34.1% of the total number of students. The proportion of students with worker-peasant backgrounds in the new students enrolled each year has grown year by year. In 1953, students with worker-peasant backgrounds enrolled in colleges and universities accounted for 27.39% of the total number of new students; in 1956, it had increased to 36.69%; in 1957, students with worker-peasant backgrounds accounted for 44% of the undergraduate and junior college students enrolled.

The vast majority of worker-peasant students studying in colleges and universities are diligent in their studies, actively progressive, and firm in their positions. They can play a good leading role in various political movements in the school. Many of them responded to Chairman Mao's call to be "good in health, good in studies, and good in work" and have been rated as "three-good" students.

In order to change the composition of college students and facilitate the entry of students with worker-peasant backgrounds into colleges and universities, in addition to running worker-peasant rapid middle schools and various types of cultural supplementary schools to improve their cultural and scientific knowledge in a relatively short period, the state has also transferred a large number of working cadres to apply for colleges and universities. In the college entrance examination, the policy of "giving priority to admitting worker-peasant students with equal grades" was adopted; in terms of enjoying people's scholarships, more care was also given to students with worker-peasant backgrounds. Colleges and universities generally take care of the characteristics of worker-peasant students and provide them with various necessary assistance in their studies.

In order to train a group of industrial enterprise management backbones with advanced industrial enterprise management and technical knowledge, according to the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, the relevant departments of the Central Government have successively transferred a group of responsible cadres who have participated in the revolution for a long time and are now in charge of factories, mines, and enterprise leadership to study. Tsinghua University, Beijing Mining Institute, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University, Northeast Institute of Technology and other thirteen higher industrial schools have established thirteen special classes for veteran cadres. There are currently 416 students in school, with an average age of around 35, and the study period is three to four years. Schools generally attach importance to running the special classes for veteran cadres, and have transferred a group of relatively excellent teachers. In terms of teaching plans and textbook selection, appropriate arrangements have been made according to the characteristics of these veteran cadres. Initial experiences have been gained in how to cultivate and improve veteran cadres to learn technical and scientific knowledge, which has created favorable conditions for better carrying out the work of cultivating veteran cadres in colleges and universities in the future.

Renmin University of China has done a lot of work in training worker-peasant in-service cadres. In the past few years, it has trained more than 10,000 in-service cadres, many of whom are veteran worker-peasant cadres who have participated in the revolution for a long time. At present, students with worker-peasant backgrounds studying at the school account for about 50% of the total number of students, including nationally known labor models Hang Peilan, Hao Jianxiu, and Lu Agou. The school has accumulated some valuable experience in training veteran worker-peasant cadres and industrial workers, which can be used for reference by other schools.

In addition, in recent years, spare-time colleges and universities have enrolled a large number of in-service cadres and industrial workers, and have established special classes specifically for leading cadres of factories, mines, and enterprises, so that they can receive higher education without leaving their work or production. At present, there are a total of 180 spare-time colleges and universities across the country, with approximately 90,000 students, of which approximately 5,000 are students in special classes.

Although colleges and universities and spare-time colleges and universities have made some achievements in implementing the policy of opening doors to workers and peasants, they are still not commensurate with the development of the country's socialist construction and the requirements for training a large number of high-level construction backbones from worker-peasant backgrounds; the cultural level of worker-peasant students needs to be further improved; the failure of a small number of individual teachers in some schools to provide enthusiastic assistance or adopt an exclusionary attitude towards worker-peasant students must be corrected.

In order to better implement the class line in higher education and vigorously implement the policy of opening doors to workers and peasants, the relevant departments of the Central Government are currently, under the direct leadership of the State Council, studying and formulating longer-term plans, and will formulate specific measures to facilitate the entry of worker-peasant cadres and workers, peasants, and children of workers and peasants into colleges and universities and secondary specialized schools.

    高等学校工农成份学生年年增加
    1957年招收的新生中工农成份学生已达到44％
    本报讯　我国高等学校在贯彻阶级路线，贯彻向工农开门的方针上已经取得了初步成绩。
    随着我国高等教育事业的飞跃发展，高等学校中工农成份及工农家庭出身的学生，逐年有了迅速的增加。根据统计材料，1951—1952学年，全国高等学校工农成份学生只占在校学生总数的19.08％，到1956—1957学年工农成份学生已经达到了在校学生总数的34.1％。在每年招收的新生中工农成份学生的比重逐年增长。1953年高等学校招收的工农成份学生占新生总数的27.39％；1956年已增至36.69％；1957年招收的本科和专科新生中工农成份学生达到了44％。
    在高等学校学习的工农学生，绝大多数都是努力学习、积极进步和立场坚定的，他们在学校的各项政治运动中，能起良好的带头作用；他们中有许多人响应了毛主席“身体好、学习好、工作好”的号召，曾被评为“三好”学生。
    为着改变高等学校学生成份，便利工农成份学生升入高等学校，国家除了举办工农速成中学以及各类的文化补习学校，在较短期间内提高他们的文化科学知识外，并抽调了大批在职干部报考高等学校。在高等学校入学考试时，并采取了“同等成绩，优先录取工农学生入学”的方针；在享受人民助学金方面，对工农成份学生也给予了较多的照顾。各高等学校一般都能照顾工农学生的特点，在学习上给了他们以各种必要的帮助。
    为了培养一批具有先进工业企业管理和技术知识的工业企业管理骨干，根据中共中央和国务院的决定，中央各有关部门曾先后抽调了一批参加革命时间较久，现在担任厂矿、企业领导工作的负责干部学习。清华大学、北京矿业学院、北京工业学院、天津大学、东北工学院等十三所高等工业学校，举办了十三处老干部特别班。现在在校学员共有四百一十六人，他们的平均年龄在三十五岁左右，学习时间三年到四年。学校一般对办好老干部特别班都是重视的，调配了一批较为优秀的教师；在教学计划、教材的选择方面，根据这些老干部的特点作了适当的安排。对于如何培养提高老干部学好技术科学知识方面，各地已经初步摸索出一些经验，这为今后在高等学校更好地开展培养老干部工作，创造了有利的条件。
    中国人民大学在培养工农在职干部方面，作了许多工作，过去几年来，已培养了一万多名在职干部，其中有许多是参加革命时间较久的工农老干部。目前在该校学习的工农成份学生约占在校学生总数的50％左右，其中有全国知名的劳动模范杭佩兰、郝建秀、陆阿狗等人。该校在培养工农老干部和产业工人方面，已经积累了一些可供其他学校借鉴的宝贵的经验。
    此外，几年来业余高等学校招收了大批在职干部和产业工人学员，并专门为厂矿、企业领导干部办有特别班，使他们在不脱离工作或生产的情况下受到高等教育。目前全国业余高等学校共有一百八十所，在校学生达到九万人左右，其中特别班学生约有五千人。
    高等学校、业余高等学校贯彻向工农开门的方针，虽然取得了一些成绩，但与国家社会主义建设事业发展，以及培养大批由工农出身的高级建设骨干人材的要求仍不相适应；工农学生文化水平亟待进一步提高；少数学校个别教师对工农学生热情帮助不够或采取排斥的态度等情况，必须加以纠正。
    为着在高等教育事业方面更好的贯彻阶级路线，大力贯彻向工农开门的方针，最近期间中央各有关部门正在国务院的直接领导下，研究制订较长远的规划，并将制订具体措施，以便利工农干部和工人、农民以及工农子弟升入高等学校和中等专业学校。　　（宋守礼）（附图片）
