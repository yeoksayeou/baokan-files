　　International Activities of Chinese Trade Unions
　　Excerpts from Liu Changsheng's Speech at the Eighth National Congress of Trade Unions
　　Since the Seventh National Congress, the international activities of Chinese trade unions have greatly developed. Our trade unions have followed the policies of the World Federation of Trade Unions and resolutely implemented the policy of promoting the unity and solidarity of international trade unions. Our trade unions have participated in all international trade union conferences, provided international support, and especially developed friendly exchanges with trade unions of various countries.
　　The fraternal and close unity between our trade unions and the trade unions of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries has been further strengthened and consolidated. In recent years, our country and the trade unions of various brother countries have not only enhanced unity and cooperation but have also further developed to more frequently exchange production experience and trade union work experience. In August 1954, our trade union sent a large delegation to visit the Soviet Union for half a year, systematically studying many aspects of Soviet trade union work. When China convened a conference of advanced producers in 1956, it invited many advanced producers from the Soviet Union and other brother countries to participate in the meeting. Before and after the meeting, they gave practical lectures on advanced work experience in various parts of China. The exchange of professional delegations between our country and other brother countries is also becoming increasingly important. This has played an important role in improving China's production level and technical level, and striving to complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule. We have also greatly strengthened our exchanges of mutual work situations and close cooperation in work with the Soviet Union and the trade unions of various people's democratic countries. These activities are of great significance for strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
　　Developing friendly ties with trade unions in Asian and African countries is an important part of the foreign activities of Chinese trade unions. Our trade union has established friendly relations with various trade union organizations in many countries in this region and has supported each other in the struggle.
　　The friendship between our country and the working class of our great neighbor India is growing. We have friendly exchanges with national trade union organizations such as the All-India Trade Union Congress, the All-India Trade Union Federation, the United Trade Union Congress, and the Labor Association. Our trade union has been invited to send a delegation to the annual meeting of the All-India Trade Union Congress, and the All-India Trade Union Congress has also sent a delegation to visit our country. The exchange of industrial trade union delegations is also increasing.
　　The friendly relations between us and the Japanese trade unions have greatly developed. Although the Japanese government has not yet established normal diplomatic relations with our country, this cannot hinder the development of friendship between the working classes of China and Japan. Lai Ruoyu, chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Totaro Fujita, former chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, signed the Sino-Japanese Trade Union Agreement in Beijing in 1955. The trade unions of the two countries jointly called on all trade unions in Asia and Africa to further strengthen friendship and unity for their common tasks, namely national independence, defense of peace, and improvement of living and working conditions. Both sides are willing to "work hard to further deepen the friendship between the trade unions of China and Japan." Subsequently, many industrial trade unions in both countries also signed agreements to strengthen friendly cooperation. This marks a new development in the friendly relations between our country and the Japanese trade unions. Last year, a delegation from our trade union visited Japan at the invitation of the Japanese trade unions, and the delegation had extensive friendly contacts with leaders of various factions of the Japanese trade unions.
　　Our trade union has also established friendly relations with various national federations of trade unions in Indonesia and Ceylon. With the development of these activities, it was possible for us this year, at the invitation of the May Day Celebration Committee, which was jointly formed by various trade unions in Indonesia, to send a delegation to participate in the May Day celebration ceremony held in Jakarta, and to visit other cities in Indonesia, and to have extensive friendly contacts with the trade union leaders and workers in these cities. We also visited this country at the joint invitation of various trade unions in Ceylon and received a wide and warm welcome.
　　Our trade union has always maintained friendly relations with the trade union of Myanmar, and we hope that this friendship will continue to develop. The friendship between our trade union and the Pakistan Trade Union Federation is also growing. Our trade union has established friendly ties with the trade unions of Nepal, Thailand, Malaya, and Singapore.
　　The friendly solidarity between our trade union and the trade unions of Arab countries has seen significant development in the past year or two. We have established close ties with the general trade unions of Egypt, Syria, Sudan, Morocco, Lebanon, Jordan, and other countries, and have also had contact with trade union leaders in Tunisia. The Chinese trade union attaches great importance to the establishment of the Arab Trade Union International Federation, and established close friendship with it from the beginning of its establishment. Facts have proven that it has played and is playing a significant role in uniting the working class of Arab countries, opposing colonialism, and safeguarding national independence. Last year, a delegation from the Arab Trade Union Federation, headed by the chairman and secretary-general of the Arab Trade Union Federation, visited our country twice. This year, a delegation from our trade union paid a return visit to the headquarters of the Arab Trade Union Federation and Egypt, Jordan, and Sudan. The delegation also visited the Moroccan Labor Union Federation. The Chinese trade union delegation, on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Arab Trade Union Federation, issued a joint statement in Cairo, emphasizing that "in order to defend national interests and vital interests, workers in Asian countries need to strive to implement the Bandung Conference resolutions and resolutely oppose imperialism's colonial policies and acts of aggression. ... In the struggle against imperialism, workers and people in Asian and African countries need to support and assist each other."
　　We have established direct friendly ties with trade union organizations in French West Africa and Equatorial Africa. Last year, trade union leaders from eight countries visited our country, further enhancing the development of friendship between us. We eagerly hope that this friendship will continue to develop and be consolidated. Our friendly contact with the General Trade Union of Ghana, which has already achieved independence, has begun.
　　The friendship between the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions has greatly increased. A delegation headed by Monk, chairman of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, visited our country this year.
　　Friendly exchanges between our trade union and trade unions in Latin American countries are also increasing. Trade unions in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay, and Peru have sent delegations to visit our country.
　　We have always maintained good friendship with the General Confederation of Labor of France and the Italian General Confederation of Labor. We greatly admire the heroic struggle of the working classes of France and Italy to defend peace and improve workers' lives.
　　Our ties with British trade unions have also developed. Delegations from our coal mining, electricity, and printing trade unions have successively visited Britain, and the number of delegations from various British trade unions visiting our country has also increased.
　　This year, a delegation from the Belgian Metalworkers' Union visited our country. They visited nearly fifty different enterprises, organizations, and cultural institutions, and had direct contact with the working masses in various parts of our country. In a written statement issued before the delegation returned home, it said: "We took away unforgettable memories. Your construction examples gave us the courage to fight. We will do our best to introduce your valuable experience to our people." We attach great importance to the results of this visit.
　　Our friendly ties with Finnish trade unions have also greatly increased, and exchanges between the general trade unions of the two countries have begun and developed. Our country has also established friendly ties with trade unions in Greece and Cyprus.
　　In the future, we will do our best to develop and consolidate the friendship that our trade union has already established with trade unions in various countries. We are also willing to develop friendly exchanges with trade union organizations in any country that has not yet established contact with us.
　　The Chinese trade union movement was once under the cruel white terror rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and it suffered the most crazy destruction. The establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949 fundamentally ended this situation, enabling the development of our country's trade union movement under completely new conditions, which also prepared new favorable conditions for our trade union's international activities. But what was our situation at that time? On the one hand, due to the conspiracy and sabotage of imperialism, the international trade union movement had been split; on the other hand, although the working masses in many countries warmly demanded to establish normal friendly relations with the working class of our country, our country was initially subjected to the blockade and obstruction of international reactionary forces headed by US imperialism.
　　Under this situation, we must seek effective ways in the international activities of trade unions to break the blockade, establish contact, enhance understanding, and develop friendship, so as to unite all trade union organizations of various countries that can be united.
　　From the practice of our activities, we have initially realized that developing extensive bilateral friendly relations with trade unions of various countries is an important way for our trade union's international activities; our policy is "equality and voluntariness, mutual respect, seeking common ground while reserving differences, and friendly consultation." We feel that under the divided situation of the international trade union movement, it is more appropriate to adopt the above principles to develop mutual friendly exchanges in order to gradually promote the unity and solidarity of international trade unions. Because the international trade union movement, as a mass movement, is itself broad. Although the specific circumstances of the working classes in various countries are different, their fundamental interests are the same. On the basis of the common interests of trade unions and workers in various countries, adopting the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences is conducive to promoting the extensive unity of trade unions and workers in various countries.
　　In the international activities of trade unions, on the one hand, it is necessary to discuss and consult, and on the other hand, it is also necessary to wait patiently. And because the situation of the trade union movement in various countries is complex, we must not only take care of other people's difficulties, but also provide effective support. Therefore, it is necessary to consult with each other to reach a consensus before implementing it, and when opinions are not consistent, they can be reserved and not forced. Doing so can enable trade union organizations with various political tendencies to interact with us and gradually achieve true unity.
　　In the past few years, in bilateral friendly activities, we have established friendly relations with trade unions of various political tendencies in many countries, especially in Asia and Africa, and we have established deep friendships with trade union leaders in many countries. This fact eloquently shows that the enemy's policy of blockade and isolation against us has to be declared a failure.
　　Comrades! The tasks of our trade union's international activities in the future are enormous. In the future, we must better assume our due responsibilities in the international trade union movement.
　　Compared with a few years ago, the international trade union movement has taken a big step forward. The Fourth World Trade Union Congress held in Leipzig, the German Democratic Republic not long ago was a great review of the world trade union movement in this period. It fully expressed that the world trade union movement has made further upsurge, and the unity and solidarity of international trade unions has a new development. Our trade union must, according to the resolutions passed by this conference, use all favorable factors, unite all forces that can be united, work hard, and fight for the promotion of the unity and solidarity of international trade unions.
　　Now, the socialist camp and the forces of world peace have definitively surpassed the forces of the imperialist camp headed by the United States, and the world situation has entered a new turning point that is beneficial to socialism. The declaration of the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries has greatly encouraged the fighting confidence of the working class all over the world. Undoubtedly, it will have a significant impact on the development of the world trade union movement.
　　Consolidating and developing the unity of trade unions in socialist countries is always our primary responsibility. In order to smoothly build socialism in our country, and in order to further develop our trade union's international activities, we must continue to learn from all the advanced experiences of the trade unions of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, and continue to strengthen and expand our close cooperation with them, so that our common cause can advance victoriously.
　　The vigorously developing trade union movements in nationally independent countries and countries striving for national independence are already an important part of the international trade union movement. Their struggles have won increasing sympathy and support from workers and all righteous people in various countries. The Chinese working class has personally suffered from colonial oppression, so it is very sympathetic to the just struggle of the worker brothers in these countries and is willing to support them with the greatest strength.
　　The Chinese working class firmly supports the just struggle of the Indonesian people to recover West Irian. The recovery of West Irian is the sacred national right of the Indonesian people to strive for territorial sovereignty and integrity. The patriotic movement launched by the Indonesian people and workers to oppose the colonizers has not only won the universal support and active support of the people of all strata in Indonesia, but also won the widest sympathy and support from workers and all peace-loving and freedom-loving people all over the world. We would like to pay our highest respect to the Indonesian people and workers who are struggling.
　　We firmly support the just struggle of workers and people in Syria, Algeria and other countries against colonialism and for national independence. Our trade union attaches great importance to the unity of trade unions in Asian and African countries. We will make greater efforts to promote the further development of friendly unity between trade unions in Asian and African countries.
　　The working classes in capitalist countries are waging a great struggle to improve living conditions, fight for democratic rights, defend peace and strive for social progress. We will strive to strengthen the friendly unity with the working classes and trade union organizations in these countries in order to win the victory in the common struggle against imperialism and international monopoly capital.
　　The Chinese working class warmly supports and responds to the peace declaration issued by the meeting of representatives of sixty-four communist and workers' parties. Defending world peace is the major responsibility of the working class and all good people all over the world. We must make every effort to defend world peace and strive for a peaceful international environment so that we can build socialism more smoothly and gradually improve the material and cultural standards of our working class and all working people.

　　中国工会的国际活动
　　刘长胜在工会“八大”的发言摘要
    “七大”以来，中国工会的国际活动有了较大的开展。我国工会遵循了世界工会联合会的方针。坚决地执行着促进国际工会统一团结的政策。我国工会参加了历次国际工会会议，进行了国际支援，特别是发展了和各国工会的友好往来。
    我国工会与苏联和各人民民主国家工会的兄弟般的亲密团结有了进一步的增强和巩固。最近几年来，我国和各兄弟国家工会不仅增强了团结合作，而且进一步发展到比较经常地交流生产经验和工会工作经验。1954年8月，我国工会派出了一个较大的代表团，在苏联访问了半年之久，对苏联工会工作的好多方面作了比较系统的学习。1956年我国召开先进生产者代表会议时，邀请了苏联和其他兄弟国家工会许多先进生产者参加会议，会议前后他们在我国各地实地传授了先进工作经验。我国和其他兄弟国家交换专业代表团的活动也愈来愈占重要地位。这对于提高我国的生产水平与技术水平，争取提前完成第一个五年计划，起了重要的作用。我们与苏联和各人民民主国家工会在交换相互工作情况和密切工作中的配合方面也大大加强了。这些活动对于加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结具有重大意义。
    开展对亚非国家工会的友好联系是我国工会对外活动的重要组成部分。我国工会已经与这个地区很多国家的各派工会组织建立了友好关系，并在斗争中相互支援。
    我国和伟大的邻邦印度工人阶级的友谊日益增进。我们和印度全国工大、全印工大、统一工大、劳协等全国性工会组织都有友好的来往。我国工会曾应邀派了代表团参加全国工大的年会，全国工大也派了代表团访问过我国。产业工会代表团的来往也在增多。
    我们和日本工会的友好关系有了很大的发展。虽然，日本政府至今尚未与我国建立正常的外交关系，但是这并不能阻碍中日两国工人阶级友谊的发展。中华全国总工会主席赖若愚和日本总评前主席藤田藤太郎1955年在北京签订了中日两国工会协议书，两国工会共同号召亚洲和非洲的一切工会，为了它们的共同任务，即民族独立、保卫和平和改善生活和劳动条件，更进一步的加强友好和团结。双方愿意“为了进一步加深中日两国工会之间的友好而努力”。接着两国很多产业工会也都签订了加强友好合作的协议书。这标志了我国和日本工会友好关系的新发展。去年我国工会代表团应邀访问了日本，代表团和日本各派工会领袖进行了广泛的友好接触。
    我国工会和印度尼西亚和锡兰各个全国性总工会也建立了友好关系。这种活动的发展，使我们今年有可能应印度尼西亚各个总工会统一组成的庆祝五一节委员会的邀请，派了代表团参加了在雅加达举行的五一庆祝典礼，并访问了印度尼西亚其他城市，和这些城市的工会领袖和工人群众有广泛的友好接触。我们也应锡兰各个总工会的联合邀请访问了这个国家，受到了广泛而热烈的欢迎。
    我国和缅甸工会一向保持着友好联系，我们希望这种友谊将不断发展。我国工会和巴基斯坦工会联合会的友谊也在增进中。我国工会和尼泊尔、泰国、马来亚、新加坡工会都已经建立了友好的联系。
    我国工会和阿拉伯国家工会的友好团结在最近一二年来有了重大的发展。我们已经和埃及、叙利亚、苏丹、摩洛哥、黎巴嫩、约旦等国的总工会建立了亲密的联系，和突尼斯的工会领袖也有接触。中国工会很重视阿拉伯工会国际联合会的成立，在它成立之初，就和它建立了亲密的友谊。事实证明：它在团结阿拉伯国家工人阶级、反对殖民主义和维护民族独立的斗争中已经起了并且正在起着显著的作用。去年以阿拉伯工联主席和总书记为首的阿拉伯工联代表团两次访问了我国。今年，我国工会代表团回访了阿拉伯工联总部和埃及、约旦、苏丹三国。代表团还访问了摩洛哥劳工联合会。中国工会代表团并代表中华全国总工会和阿拉伯工联在开罗发表了联合声明，强调“为了保卫民族利益和切身利益，亚洲各国工人需要努力贯彻万隆会议决议，坚决反对帝国主义的殖民政策和侵略行为。……在反对帝国主义的斗争中，亚非各国工人和人民需要相互支持和援助。”
    我们和法属西非和赤道非洲各国工会组织已经建立了直接的友好联系。去年八个国家的工会领袖到我国访问，进一步增进了我们之间友谊的发展。我们热望这种友谊不断得到发展和巩固。我们和已经取得独立的加纳总工会的友好接触已经开始了。
    中华全国总工会和澳大利亚工会理事会的友谊有了很大的增进。以澳大利亚工会理事会主席蒙克为首的代表团今年访问了我国。
    我国工会和拉丁美洲国家工会的友好往来也日益增进。巴西、智利、墨西哥、阿根廷、乌拉圭、秘鲁工会都曾派过代表团来我国访问。
    我们和法国总工会和意大利总工会一直保持着良好的友谊。我们对法、意两国工人阶级为保卫和平和改善工人生活所进行的英勇的斗争十分钦佩。
    我国和英国工会的联系也有发展。我国的煤矿、电力、印刷工会代表团相继访问了英国，英国各工会代表团到我国来访问的次数，也增多了。
    今年比利时五金工会代表团访问了我国。他们参观了近五十个不同的企业、团体和文化机构，和我国各地的工人群众进行了直接接触。在代表团回国前发表的书面声明中说：“我们带走了永不磨灭的回忆，你们建设的榜样给我们斗争勇气，我们将尽力向我们的人民介绍你们的宝贵经验。”我们十分重视这次访问的结果。
    我们和芬兰工会的友好联系也大大增进了，两国总工会的来往已经开始并且有了发展。我国和希腊与塞浦路斯工会也建立了友好的联系。
    今后，我们将尽力发展并且巩固我国工会与各国工会之间已经建立的友谊。我们也愿意和一切还没有与我们建立联系的任何国家的工会组织发展友好来往关系。
    中国工会运动曾经长期处于帝国主义和国民党反动派残酷的白色恐怖统治之下，它曾遭到最疯狂的破坏。1949年中华人民共和国的成立才根本结束了这种局面，使我国的工会运动在完全新的条件下发展起来，这给我国工会的国际活动也准备了新的有利的条件。但是我们当时的处境是怎样的呢？一方面，由于帝国主义的阴谋破坏，国际工会运动已经被分裂；另一方面，虽然许多国家的工人群众热烈地要求和我国工人阶级建立正常的友好关系，但是我们国家一开始就受到以美帝国主义为首的国际反动力量的封锁和阻挠。
    在这种局面之下，我们必须在工会的国际活动中寻求有效的办法来打破封锁，取得联系，增进了解，发展友谊，以便团结一切可以团结的各国工会组织。
    我们从活动的实践中初步体会到：发展与各国工会的广泛的双边友好联系是我国工会国际活动的重要方式；我们的活动方针是“平等自愿、相互尊重、求同存异、友好协商”。我们感到在国际工会运动分裂形势之下，采取上述原则，发展相互之间的友好来往，以逐步促进国际工会的统一团结，这样做是比较适当的。因为国际工会运动作为一个群众性的运动，本身具有广泛性。各国工人阶级的具体处境虽然有所不同，根本利益则是一致的。在各国工会和工人群众的共同利益的基础上，采取求同存异的原则，是有助于促进各国工会和工人的广泛团结的。
    在工会的国际活动中，一方面需要讨论、协商，另一方面也要耐心地等待。而由于各国工会运动处境复杂，我们既要照顾人家的困难，又要给予有效的支援。因此，有必要有事彼此协商取得一致意见后才执行，意见不一致时可以保留，不要勉强。这样做能够使各种政治倾向的工会组织与我们往来，逐渐达到真正的团结。
    几年来，我们在双边友好活动中和很多国家特别是亚非各国各种政治倾向的工会建立了友好联系，我们和很多国家的工会领袖建立了深厚的友谊。这个事实雄辩地说明了敌人对我们所实行的封锁、孤立的政策不得不宣告失败。
    同志们！我国工会今后国际活动的任务是巨大的。今后必须在国际工会运动中更好地担当起应尽的责任来。
    和几年前比较起来，国际工会运动已向前迈进了一大步。不久前在德意志民主共和国莱比锡举行的世界工会第四次代表大会是这一时期世界工会运动的一次大检阅，它充分表达了世界工会运动已有了进一步的高涨，国际工会的统一团结已有了新的发展。我国工会必须根据这次大会所通过的决议，利用一切有利的因素，团结一切可以团结的力量，努力工作，为促进国际工会的统一团结而斗争。
    现在，社会主义阵营和世界和平的力量已经确定地超过了以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的力量，世界形势已经进入有利于社会主义的新的转折点。社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言大大鼓舞了全世界工人阶级的斗争信心。无疑它对世界工会运动的发展将产生重大的影响。
    巩固和发展社会主义各国工会的团结始终是我们的首要责任。为了我国顺利地建设社会主义，为了进一步开展我国工会的国际活动，我们必须继续学习苏联和各人民民主国家工会的一切先进经验，继续加强和扩大与它们的亲密合作，以便我们的共同事业胜利地前进。
    民族独立国家和正在争取民族独立国家的蓬勃发展的工会运动已经是国际工会运动中的一个重要组成部分。它们的斗争赢得各国工人群众和一切正义人士愈来愈多的同情与支援。中国工人阶级亲身受过殖民主义的压迫，因此对这些国家工人兄弟的正义斗争十分同情并愿意以最大力量加以支持。
    中国工人阶级坚决支持印度尼西亚人民收复西伊里安的正义斗争。收复西伊里安是印度尼西亚人民争取领土主权完整的神圣的民族权利，印度尼西亚人民和工人一致奋起进行的反对殖民者的爱国运动，不仅获得了印度尼西亚国内各阶层人民的普遍赞助与积极支持，而且也得到了全世界工人和一切爱好和平与自由的人民最广泛的同情与支持。我们谨向正在斗争中的印度尼西亚人民和工人致以崇高的敬意。
    我们坚决支持叙利亚、阿尔及利亚和其他国家工人和人民反对殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的正义斗争。我国工会非常重视亚非国家工会的团结，我们将以更大的努力来促进亚非各国工会友好团结的进一步的发展。
    资本主义国家的工人阶级正在进行着改善生活条件、争取民主权利、保卫和平和争取社会进步的巨大斗争。我们将努力加强和这些国家工人阶级和工会组织的友好团结，以便取得反对帝国主义和国际垄断资本这一共同斗争的胜利。
    中国工人阶级热烈拥护并响应六十四个共产党和工人党代表会议所发出的和平宣言。保卫世界和平是全世界工人阶级和善良人民的重大责任。我们必须作各种努力保卫世界和平，争取一个和平的国际环境，以便我们能够比较顺利地建设社会主义，使我国工人阶级和全体劳动人民的物质、文化水平逐步提高。
