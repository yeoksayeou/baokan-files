Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 30th: An article published in the November 20th issue of "Japan News Weekly" stated that since the successful launch of the Soviet artificial satellite, the illusion of "America's absolute superiority" has vanished, and the international status of the United States has declined. This reality has caused a great shock within the Japanese ruling group. The article points out that the Japanese ruling group is now forced to deeply consider how to handle Japan's relationship with the United States in the new situation and strive to enhance Japan's position.

The magazine quoted many talks by economic and political leaders to illustrate the impact of the Soviet satellite.

Kiichiro Sato, Vice Chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (President of Mitsui Bank), said: Japan no longer needs to agree to whatever the United States demands as it did in the past. He said: Japan can establish close cooperation with the United States in science. However, if Japan is to cooperate with the United States within the framework of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, it would be very difficult.

The general manager of a bank belonging to the old Japanese Zaibatsu system said that the Soviet Union will cause the intermediate regions of the world to lean towards its side. In this situation, the United States will find it very difficult to implement its policies in all aspects. The general manager said that the intermediate regions he mentioned include the people of Asian and African countries and the Japanese people.

Ichiro Kono, who holds great influence in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said: In today's world situation, it is not easy to determine which world camp Japan belongs to. Faced with the overbearing attitude of the United States, it is necessary for Japan to move towards an independent path. What Japan needs most is to increase the country's wealth. Regarding the Soviet Union and China, Japan should also develop relations with them from the perspective of its own interests. Tokutaro Kitamura, who is closely related to Ichiro Kono, said that the conservative party must change its foreign policy. He believes that the diplomatic line of former Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama was appropriate, and it is now necessary to restore Hatoyama's diplomatic policy. Keizo Shibusawa, who once served as Japan's roving ambassador to visit Central and South America, said: Japan has overemphasized Europe and the United States in the past, and it is now necessary to abandon this old concept.

"Japan News Weekly" said: Since the appearance of the Soviet artificial satellite, Nobusuke Kishi's foreign policy based on reliance on the United States has encountered obstacles in many aspects. Now, the Japanese political situation is in a state of new tension. The main reason for the tension is the growing dissatisfaction of the people with the domestic and foreign policies of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet. The main manifestation of the tense political situation is the wavering, divisions, deepening factional contradictions, and醞釀reorganization of the conservative party. The magazine said: Within the conservative party, the calls for "implementing a policy of peaceful coexistence to refresh and reorganize the Japanese conservative party" and "the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations should be realized by the conservative party rather than the Socialist Party" have become increasingly strong.

"Japan News Weekly" finally pointed out that these contradictions presented by the conservative party are essentially a reflection of the increasingly strong demands of people from all walks of life in Japan for the implementation of neutralism and a policy of peaceful coexistence.

　　苏联人造卫星高照　美国国际地位下降
　　岸信介依赖美国政策多方面碰壁
　　日本政界和经济界首脑主张修改外交路线
    据新华社30日讯　东京消息：11月20日出版的一期“日本新闻周刊”发表文章说：苏联发射人造卫星成功以后，“美国的绝对优势”的幻想已经消失，美国的国际地位下降了。这一现实在日本统治集团中引起很大的震动。文章指出，目前，日本的统治集团已经不得不开始深深地考虑在新的形势下处理日本同美国的关系中争取提高日本的地位的问题。
    这家杂志引述了很多经济界和政界首脑的谈话来说明苏联卫星的影响。
    日本经济团体联合会副会长（三井银行总经理）佐藤喜一郎说：日本不需要再像过去那样，美国要求什么就答应什么了。他说：日本可以在科学上同美国建立密切的合作。但是，如果要日本在东南亚条约组织的范围内同美国实行合作，那是十分困难的。
    日本旧财阀系统的一家银行的总经理说，苏联将会使世界上的处于中间状态的地区倾向于它自己的一边。在这种情况下，美国将发觉它要在各个方面推行它的政策是非常困难的。这位总经理说，他提到的处于中间状态的地区中有亚洲和非洲国家的人民和日本人民。
    在执政的自由民主党中拥有很大势力的河野一郎说：在今天的世界形势下，确定日本属于那一个世界阵营并不是轻而易举的事。面对着美国的强横态度，日本有必要向自主的道路前进。日本最需要的是增加国家的财富。对于苏联和中国，日本也应该从自身利益的观点出发，开展同它们的来往。同河野一郎关系较密切的北村德太郎说，保守政党必须改变它的外交政策。他认为日本前首相鸠山的外交路线是妥当的，现在有必要恢复鸠山的外交政策。曾经担任过日本的巡回使节访问中南美洲的涩泽敬三说：日本在过去过分重视欧美，现在有必要放弃这种旧的观念。
    “日本新闻周刊”说：在苏联人造卫星出现以后，岸信介的以依赖美国为基础的外交政策已经在很多方面碰到了障碍。现在，日本政局处于新的紧张状态中。紧张的主要原因是人民对岸信介内阁的对内对外政策的不满日益增长。政局紧张的主要表现形式是保守政党内部在政策上的动摇、分歧、派系矛盾加深和酝酿改组保守政党。这家杂志说：在保守政党内部要求“实行和平共处政策来刷新和改组日本的保守政党”、“应该由保守政党而不应该由社会党实现恢复日中邦交”的呼声已经日益强烈。
    “日本新闻周刊”最后指出，保守政党呈现出的这些矛盾在本质上是日本各阶层人民要求实行中立主义、和平共处政策的日益强烈的反映。
