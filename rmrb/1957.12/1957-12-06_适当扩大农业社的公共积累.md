The agricultural production cooperatives in various regions are conducting the year-end income distribution. In the distribution, we must conscientiously implement the policy of overall consideration and appropriate arrangements, and the principle of distribution according to work and more pay for more work, so that the members of the cooperative with different labor and income situations get what they deserve, and that the relations between various aspects inside and outside the cooperative are properly handled. In particular, the relationship between the accumulation and consumption of agricultural cooperatives must be properly resolved.

The current situation is that, on the one hand, many cooperative members demand to increase their income as much as possible in order to better improve their lives; on the other hand, agricultural cooperatives in various regions are urgently in need of accumulating more material and financial resources in order to develop production on a larger scale. Under such circumstances, when the autumn harvest distribution is carried out, from cadres to every cooperative member, they will naturally consider a question: After the agricultural cooperative pays agricultural tax, repays the national bank loans due, and repays the cooperative members' production materials at discounted prices and investments, how much production funds should be retained and how much should be distributed to the cooperative members? This question involves collective interests and individual interests, long-term interests and immediate interests, and also involves the relationship between cooperative members. Whether this problem can be properly handled is of great significance to the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives and the development of production in the future.

Last year, the first year after agricultural cooperation, agricultural cooperatives in various regions implemented the principle of "less deduction and more distribution," generally distributing 60% to 70% of the total income to cooperative members, ensuring that most cooperative members increased their income in the first year of joining the cooperative. This was necessary and correct. Facts have proved that this has a positive effect on encouraging the production enthusiasm of the vast number of cooperative members and consolidating agricultural cooperatives. This year, most areas have better harvests than last year. Except for a very few agricultural cooperatives that have suffered severe disasters, the total income and net income of the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives have increased substantially. This makes it possible to retain more public accumulation and production costs than last year while ensuring that the majority of cooperative members increase their income.

Public accumulation is the material basis for the development of agricultural cooperatives' production. One of the important reasons why agricultural cooperatives are superior to individual farmers is that they can rely on the collective strength to continuously and systematically carry out expanded reproduction, so that production can develop rapidly and all cooperative members can continuously increase their income. Therefore, every agricultural cooperative must embody its superiority, make full use of its human, material and financial resources, and actively carry out basic construction, such as increasing production equipment, building water conservancy projects, improving soil, conserving water and soil, planting trees and afforestation, etc., in order to continuously expand the scale of production and enrich the content of production. Only in this way can agricultural cooperatives maximize their production potential and more effectively overcome natural disasters. However, if agricultural cooperatives cannot appropriately increase capital accumulation according to needs and possibilities, the things mentioned above will not be done, or not be done well.

The accumulation of public property is also an important material basis for consolidating agricultural cooperatives. Many agricultural cooperatives have become consolidated cooperatives that "cannot be broken up even with a stick" because their public property has increased significantly, and increasing production and income has become increasingly guaranteed. One of the important reasons why most agricultural cooperatives have not yet exceeded the production level and income level of local wealthy middle peasants is that the number of means of production per capita in these agricultural cooperatives is not as much as that of wealthy middle peasants. In order to develop production more quickly, to achieve the goal of catching up with or surpassing the production level of wealthy middle peasants in the second five-year plan, and thus further consolidate the collectivization system, agricultural production cooperatives must pay attention to continuously expanding capital accumulation. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping said in his report on the rectification movement: "With more public property, the cooperative will be as solid as steel and cement, otherwise it will be as easy to scatter as a pile of sand."

Who would want to run an agricultural cooperative like a "pile of sand"? Who would not want our every agricultural cooperative to be like "steel and cement"? However, this is not a question of who wants it or not, it depends on what effective measures we take to increase the public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives.

At present, the financial strength of most agricultural cooperatives is relatively weak, and some cooperatives even feel that funds are extremely lacking. Last year, during the distribution, most cooperatives had just been established, and their foundations were relatively empty, so they could only retain very little public reserve fund and production costs; in addition, some cooperatives suffered severe disasters, and some people one-sidedly and excessively emphasized "less deduction and more distribution," resulting in only a little production costs being retained, no public reserve fund being retained, and a very few cooperatives even distributing the production costs. According to a survey in Suichuan County, Jiangxi Province, the 377 cooperatives in the county retained a total of more than 215,000 yuan in public reserve funds in the autumn harvest distribution plan last year, plus public welfare funds, totaling 2.33% of the total income. This is already too little. However, in the actual distribution, 28 cooperatives also distributed the public accumulation determined to be retained in the distribution plan, and 142 cooperatives even distributed the loans that should have been repaid. Only 201 cooperatives retained more than 166,000 yuan in public accumulation, averaging only 1.2 yuan per member. In the past one or two years, many agricultural cooperatives lacking funds, although supported by national loans, have carried out production and some basic construction, but they have still been restricted more or less by insufficient funds in giving full play to their production potential. Of course, financial difficulties are difficult to completely avoid in the early stage of establishment; however, this difficulty must be gradually overcome in the future. Every agricultural cooperative should rely on the efforts of all members, work hard and thriftily to gradually accumulate the relatively sufficient funds needed for production development.

Judging from the situation of formulating autumn harvest distribution plans in various regions this year, many agricultural cooperatives have already paid attention to the issue of capital accumulation. According to statistics from 1,347 cooperatives in seven counties including Hong'an, Luotian, and Daye in Huanggang Prefecture, Hubei Province, according to the distribution plan, the production funds for next year are basically sufficient for 513 cooperatives, and completely sufficient or surplus for 475 cooperatives, accounting for more than 73% of the total number of cooperatives. Among them, some agricultural cooperatives with more production increases have also retained sufficient "two sets of capital" in the spirit of "making up for deficits with surpluses," so that even in years of disaster, production funds will be sufficient.

It should be seen that appropriately expanding accumulation is contrary to the thinking of people represented by wealthy middle peasants in agricultural cooperatives who have more serious individualistic ideas. These people often think more about their personal immediate interests and less about collective and long-term interests, and do not understand that only by expanding public accumulation can future income increase more and more steadily. There are also some people who are simply not happy to run the cooperative well and always want to dismantle the cooperative, so as to "freely develop" capitalism; they demand that all the income of the cooperative be distributed. Some cooperative cadres accommodate the one-sided idea of some cooperative members who demand more distribution, and even if production in the cooperative has increased a lot, they do not plan to appropriately increase some public accumulation, one-sidedly thinking that the more distributed to the cooperative members, the more it can show the "superiority" of the cooperative, and the more consolidated the cooperative will be. This is obviously wrong.

To correctly solve the problem of how much to retain and how much to distribute, the best way is to carry out mass debates. Through the debate, the vast number of cooperative members should understand the relationship between accumulation and consumption, and understand that the income of the year cannot be completely distributed and eaten up. In the debate, we should provide more facts, experiences and lessons from our own cooperative and nearby cooperatives, so that everyone knows what things the funds retained in the past have been used for, and what benefits the cooperative and cooperative members have received. The Shuangqi Agricultural Cooperative in Yangliuqing Town, Hebei Province, increased its income by 31% this year, but only planned to deduct 7% of the total income as public reserve fund when initially formulating the autumn harvest distribution plan; the average income of cooperative members would increase by 36% compared to last year. After a major debate, the cooperative members fully understood the benefits of expanding public accumulation from the past production increase, and unanimously agreed to increase the public reserve fund to more than 13% of this year's total income. In this way, the average income of cooperative members can still increase by more than 19% compared to last year. Many cooperative members also demanded further careful calculations and more production funds.

Of course, in the issue of retaining public accumulation and production costs, we cannot depart from the principle of overall consideration. We should ensure that the majority of cooperative members appropriately increase their income, and appropriately expand public accumulation and increase production costs. Here, the important issue is to formulate an appropriate retention ratio based on production needs and actual possibilities on the basis of mobilizing cooperative members to repeatedly debate and negotiate. Generally speaking, cooperatives with more production increases this year should have a larger retention ratio, and retain sufficient public reserve funds and production costs necessary for production and construction while ensuring that the majority of cooperative members increase their income; cooperatives with less production increases can have a smaller retention ratio, so as not to affect the income of cooperative members too much. Some county committees analyzed the situation of agricultural cooperatives in their counties and proposed different retention ratios based on the average income per capita in the cooperatives. There are benefits to doing so, because with the different retention ratios proposed by the county's leading organs according to different situations, each agricultural cooperative has a more specific reference standard for deliberating and increasing or decreasing when discussing the issue of how much to retain and how much to distribute, so that this issue can be resolved more reasonably.

Is it to be "steel and cement" or a "pile of sand"? This question should be the subject of a heated debate in every agricultural cooperative. This is a part of the great debate on the two roads in the countryside, and also a part of the great debate on agricultural production and construction, which can be closely combined with these two major debates. As long as we are good at using the working method of the mass line of great debate under the leadership of party organizations at all levels, in this year's autumn harvest distribution work, agricultural cooperatives will surely be able to handle the relations between various aspects inside and outside the cooperative, including the relationship between accumulation and consumption, better. In this way, it will be conducive to mobilizing the production enthusiasm of all cooperative members, fully utilizing the financial and material resources of agricultural cooperatives, and completely consolidating agricultural cooperatives, so as to create greater achievements in agricultural production and construction.

### 适当扩大农业社的公共积累

    适当扩大农业社的公共积累
    各地农业生产合作社正在进行全年收益的总分配。在分配中必须认真执行统筹兼顾、适当安排的方针和按劳取酬、多劳多得的原则，使劳动和收入的状况不同的社员各得其所，使社内外各方面的关系得到妥善的处理，特别是要使农业社的积累和消费的关系问题得到妥善的解决。
    目前的情况是：一方面有许多社员要求尽可能更多地增加收入，以便更好地改善生活；另一方面，各地农业合作社都迫切需要聚积更多的物力、财力，以便更大规模地发展生产。在这样情况下，当进行秋收分配的时候，从干部到每个社员，就很自然地考虑到一个问题：农业合作社在缴纳农业税、归还到期的国家银行贷款、偿还社员生产资料折价款和投资以后，究竟应当留多少生产资金，分多少给社员呢？这个问题涉及集体利益和个人利益，长远利益和眼前利益，同时也涉及社员和社员之间的关系。这个问题能否得到正确的处理，对于今后农业社的巩固和生产的发展，有重大的关系。
    在去年，农业合作化后的第一年，各地农业合作社执行了“少扣多分”的原则，一般都做到把总收入的60％到70％分配给社员，保证多数社员在入社的第一年就增加了收入。这是必要的和正确的。事实已经证明，这样做对于鼓励广大社员的生产积极性和巩固农业社都有积极的作用。今年，多数地区收成比去年好，除了极少数受灾较重的农业社以外，绝大多数农业社的总收入和纯收入都大量增加了。这样就有可能在保证大多数社员增加收入的情况下，尽可能比去年多留一些公共积累和生产费用。
    公共积累是农业合作社发展生产的物质基础。农业合作社之所以优越于个体农民，重要的原因之一就在于它能够依靠集体的力量，不断地有计划地进行扩大再生产，使生产迅速向前发展，使全体社员不断地增加收入。因此，每一个农业合作社要体现自己的优越性，就必须充分利用自己的人力物力财力，积极进行基本建设，如增置生产设备、兴修水利、改良土壤、保持水土、植树造林等等，以便不断地扩大生产规模，丰富生产内容。只有这样，农业合作社才能最大限度地发挥增产潜力，比较有效地战胜自然灾害。但是，假如农业合作社不能根据需要和可能，适当地增加资金积累，前面说的这些事情就做不成，也做不好的。
    公共财产的积累，也是巩固农业合作社的重要物质基础。许多农业合作社因为公共财产大量增加，增加生产、增加收入越来越有保证，变成了“棒打也不散”的巩固的合作社。现在多数农业合作社之所以还没有超过当地富裕中农的生产水平和收入水平，重要原因之一就是这些农业社按人口平均的生产资料数量没有富裕中农的多。为了更快地发展生产，实现在第二个五年计划内赶上或超过富裕中农生产水平这个目标，从而进一步巩固合作化制度，农业生产合作社必须注意不断地扩大资金积累。正像邓小平同志在关于整风运动的报告中所说的：“有了较多的公共财产，才会使合作社像钢骨水泥般地巩固起来，否则会像沙堆一样容易散掉。”
    有谁愿意把农业合作社办得像“沙堆”一样的？谁不愿意我们的每一个农业合作社都像“钢骨水泥”一样的呢？可是，这不是谁愿意不愿意的问题，这是要看我们采取什么有效的办法增加农业合作社的公共积累。
    目前多数农业合作社的资金力量是比较薄弱的，部分合作社甚至感到资金极端缺乏。去年分配当中，多数合作社建社不久，底子较空，只能留下很少的公积金和生产费用；另外还有一部分合作社受到严重灾害，再加有些人片面地过分地强调“少扣多分”，结果，只留了一点生产费用，没有留公积金，还有极少数合作社连生产费用也没有留。据江西省遂川县调查，全县三百七十七个社在去年秋收分配方案上，共扣留公积金二十一万五千多元，加上公益金，合计共占总收入的2.33％。这已经是太少了。但是，在实际分配的时候，有二十八个社又把分配方案确定扣留的公共积累也分掉了，有一百四十二个社甚至连应归还的贷款也分了。只有二百零一个社共留了十六万六千多元公共积累，平均每个社员仅有一元二角。在过去的一两年中，许多缺乏资金的农业合作社，虽然在国家贷款的扶持下，进行了生产和一些基本建设，但是，在发挥增产潜力上仍或多或少地受到资金不足的限制。当然，资金困难在建社初期是难以完全避免的；但是，这个困难，必须在今后逐步加以克服。每一个农业合作社都应当依靠全体社员的努力，克勤克俭地逐步积累起发展生产所需要的比较充裕的资金。
    从今年各地制订秋收分配方案的情况看来，许多农业合作社已经注意了资金积累的问题。据湖北省黄冈专区红安、罗田、大冶等七个县一千三百四十七个社的统计，根据分配方案，明年生产资金基本够用的有五百一十三个社，完全够用或有余的有四百七十五个社，两者共占总社数的73％以上。其中，有些增产较多的农业合作社，还根据“以丰补歉”的精神，留足了“两套本钱”，今后即使遇上受灾之年，生产资金也够用。
    应该看到，适当地扩大积累，是同农业合作社中以一部分个人主义思想比较严重的富裕中农为代表的人的思想相抵触的。这些人往往为个人的眼前利益设想的多，为集体利益和长远利益设想的少，而不了解只有扩大了公共积累将来的收入才能增加得更多更稳当。也还有些人根本不高兴把社办好，总想拆合作社的台，好去“自由发展”资本主义；他们要求把社里的收入都分掉。有些社干部迁就部分社员要求多分的片面思想，在社里生产增加了很多的情况下也不打算适当地增加一些公共积累，片面地认为分给社员的越多就越能表现出社的“优越性”，社也就会更巩固。这显然是不对的。
    要正确地解决留多少和分多少的问题，最好的办法就是开展群众性的大辩论。通过大辩论，使广大社员了解积累和消费的关系，了解不能把当年的收入通通分掉吃光用光的道理。在辩论中，应当多提供本社和附近的一些社的事实、经验和教训，以便使大家都知道过去留的资金都用来做了哪些事情，社和社员得到了哪些好处。河北省杨柳青镇双旗农业社，今年的收入比去年增加了31％，在最初制订秋收分配方案的时候却只打算从总收入中扣出7％做公积金；社员的平均收入却比去年要增加36％。经过大辩论，社员从过去增产的事实中充分了解了扩大公共积累的好处，就一致同意把公积金增加到占今年总收入的13％以上。这样，社员的平均收入仍然可以比去年增加19％强。许多社员还要求进一步精打细算，再多留些生产资金。
    当然，在扣留公共积累和生产费用的问题上，不能离开统筹兼顾的原则。应该做到既保证大多数社员适当地增加收入，又适当地扩大公共积累和增加生产费用。这里，重要的问题是在发动社员群众反复辩论和协商的基础上，按照生产需要和实际可能，订出一个恰当的扣留比例。一般地说，今年增产较多的社，扣留比例应该大一些，在保证大多数社员增加收入的情况下，尽可能留足生产和建设所必需的公积金和生产费；增产较少的社，扣留比例可以小一点，以免过多地影响社员的收入。有些县委分析了本县农业合作社的情况，提出了分别按合作社内每人平均收入数确定几种不同的扣留比例。这样做有好处，因为有了县的领导机关分别不同情况提出的不同扣留比例，各个农业合作社在讨论留多少和分多少的问题的时候，就有了比较具体的、斟酌增减的参考标准，使这个问题可能比较合理地得到解决。
    究竟是做“钢骨水泥”还是做“沙堆”？这个问题应该在每一个农业合作社中展开热烈的辩论。这是关于农村两条道路的大辩论的一部分，也是关于农业生产建设的大辩论的一部分，可以同这两项大辩论密切地结合起来进行。只要在各级党组织领导下善于运用大辩论这个群众路线的工作方法，在今年的秋收分配工作中，农业合作社一定能够把社内外各方面的关系，包括积累和消费的关系，处理得更好。这样，就有利于把全体社员的生产积极性调动起来，把农业社的财力物力充分利用起来，使农业社完全巩固起来，在农业生产建设方面创造出更巨大的成就。
