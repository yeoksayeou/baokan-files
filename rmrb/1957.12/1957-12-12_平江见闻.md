What I Saw in Pingjiang
By our reporter Huang Yubai
　　
I just returned from Pingjiang County, and my friends asked me, "Can you tell me some moving stories? I heard that the production drive there is one of the best in Hunan Province." I thought, how can I possibly tell it all? The people there are creating miracles day and night. With a collective shout and a wave of their hoes, the land is transformed. People say it doesn't feel like winter there. Indeed, there is no winter there; winter there is even more lively than spring.

　　Let me tell you a few small stories.

　　Aunt Geng's Birthday

　　Geng, the wife of Wuguang Cooperative member Shan Qiuming, was supposed to celebrate her birthday on November 15th. Her brother-in-law, Zhang Kaike, specially brought a basket of meat, noodles, fruits, and cakes as a gift, taking time out of his schedule to wish her a happy birthday that day. However, when he arrived at her house, he saw that the door was locked. He ran to two or three other courtyards but couldn't find anyone. Finally, he found an old man in a roadside temple. After inquiring, he learned that everyone had gone to work since dawn. Zhang Kaike thought, "They will come back for lunch," so he decided to wait at the door. He waited and waited, but the sun had already moved to the west side of the mountain, and he still hadn't seen his sister, who was supposed to be celebrating her birthday, return home. How long should he wait? He also had to go to work tomorrow, and he still had five fen of wheat to replant. Disappointed, he went back with the basket of gifts, resulting in Zhang Kaike having a very, very late dinner that day.

　　To be honest, Aunt Geng and her husband hadn't forgotten that it was her birthday. In the past, they always had something to eat at this time of year, and there were always some visitors. This year, they had planned to break the old customs half a month in advance. Early in the morning, the couple brought their meals and went to the mountain with the fifteen members of their team to shovel sod. On this one day alone, the whole team accumulated 450 bundles of sod fertilizer.

　　Farm Implements Sold Out

　　Pingjiang County responded the fastest to the leadership method of Hong'an County, Hubei. As soon as the People's Daily news came out, cooperative cadres were buying hoes everywhere. Comrades were determined to buy their own sets of farm tools to work on experimental fields. After the county's cadre meeting of over 1,800 people ended on November 13th, the farm implements in the county town's supply and marketing cooperative were snatched up. After the cadres went to the countryside, the farm implements in eleven branch stores were also sold out. The demand for farm implements from cadres going to the countryside was very high, with an average of three to four sets purchased per person. Hu Zijia, a cadre from Dongta Township, bought three large and small hoes, a carrying basket, and a raincoat and hat, a total of six items, all by himself. In the three days that cadres went to the countryside, the county purchased over 7,000 farm implements. The supply and marketing cooperative in Wengjiang Township almost sold out of hoes, rakes, raincoats, hats, carrying baskets, manure buckets, straw sandals, and other items.

　　Now the masses are saying that the cadres have changed. Someone in Meixian Township said, "In the past, cadres had three 'zi' [character]: shoes and socks on their feet, a red notebook in their hands, and an official air about their walk; now cadres have three 'tou' [head]: barefoot and bareheaded, a big hoe in their hands, and leading the way in production." At a township and cooperative cadre meeting of over 420 people held in Tuanshan Township on the evening of November 17th, everyone automatically brought a hoe with them. After the meeting had been going on for half an hour, Peng Guangchu, the secretary of the township's Party committee, shouted to go up the mountain, leading everyone to dig twenty mu of oil-tea camellia mountain in one go. The cadres who went to the countryside all said, "This time, we have our own tools, which is very convenient. I am determined to dig gold from under the hoe."

　　The First Banner

　　In the middle of a plot of land next to the road in the first team of the Beihu Agricultural Cooperative, four li away from Pingjiang City, there is a wooden sign that says: "Wang Xiaoliang and Shi Fugui's high-yield experimental field, 1.6 mu, guaranteeing a yield of 1,500 jin of grain." This is the experimental field of Wang Xiaoliang, the secretary of the Pingjiang County Party Committee, and Shi Fugui, the secretary of the Discipline Inspection Committee.

　　In order to work on the experimental field, Wang Xiaoliang spent three or four days selecting the old farmer Chen Youren as his teacher. He said, "Old You (a respectful term for Chen Youren) has been farming for more than thirty years and has suffered a lifetime of hardship. He is now willing to share all his skills." But Old You thought at the time, "It's not easy being a teacher to the county Party secretary. If I don't do well, I will not only let down the political commissar, but also be criticized by the masses." Wang Xiaoliang talked to him again and again before signing the contract. While other cooperative members were still clearing the late rice straw, Wang Xiaoliang and Shi Fugui dug a manure pond that could hold 700 dan of fertilizer on the experimental field. This was the first large manure pond to appear in the whole village.

　　Now Old You often says to people, "Secretary Wang learns with such patience. He learned to make southern paddy field ponds with just one lesson." Sometimes, if the young people casually rummage through the sod in the manure pond, Old You will scold them, "This was dug by Secretary Wang with blisters on his hands, and it's no worse than you." But the young people's enthusiasm also rises, and they say, "We'll just compare and see who succeeds in the end."

　　He Could No Longer Stay There!

　　As early as a month ago, all the cadres who were transferred to the countryside in Wengjiang Township carried their quilts to the countryside to settle down. However, Pan Junlai, a cadre who was transferred to the countryside from the Wengjiang Supply and Marketing Cooperative, always slept in the office, reluctant to roll up his bedding. The set of hoes and carrying baskets he bought also slept with him in the room every day, with no place to use them.

　　As time went by, Pan Junlai saw that Li Shaoliang, the director of the Party Working Committee of the Wengjiang Office, still carried manure and shoveled sod after the meetings every day. His hands were blistered, but he was still shouting, "Suffer minor injuries but don't step down from the front line." He also saw that the masses of the whole township were busy working from dawn till dusk. Xiang Zhiren, the poor peasant cooperative member who was most familiar with him, even ran over one day and kindly asked him, "Comrade Pan, when are you moving to the cooperative? I'll help you move your bedding."

　　This was such a profound stimulus to Pan Junlai! He couldn't bear it any longer. In the middle of the night on the 13th, he resolutely got out of bed, carried his quilt, hung up his hoe and raincoat, and ran out after shouting to open the door of the office.

　　Before dawn, Pan Junlai arrived at Xiang Zhiren's house. Xiang Zhiren warmly welcomed him and said kindly to Pan Junlai, "Everything can be learned. I will definitely work with you on running the cooperative and cultivating a experimental field together. No matter how great the difficulties, we will work together to overcome them."

　　This time, Pan Junlai can indeed be said to have carried the last bundle of cotton bedding to the countryside, and it was also this time that he truly brought his heart down with him.

　　平江见闻
　　本报记者　黄驭白
    我刚从平江县回来，朋友们就问我：“你能不能告诉我一些动人的事情？听说那儿的生产劲头是湖南全省都有数的。”我想，这怎么说得完呢？那儿的人们日日夜夜都在创造奇迹。大伙儿发一声喊，把锄头一挥，土地就得变一个样。人们都说那里不像是冬天，是的，那里就没有冬天，那里的冬天比春天还热闹。
    就让我说几件小事吧。
    庚大嫂过生日
    梧光社社员单求名的老伴庚大嫂，本来要在11月15日过生日，她的姐夫张开科特地提了一篮子肉、面、果、饼等礼物，趁这天抽着空来给她祝寿。可是一到屋门口，看见她家的大门在锁着。他一连跑了两三个屋场，都没碰见一个人，最后在路边一间古庙里找到一个老人家，问清之后，才知道这些人从天亮起来就出工去了。张开科想：他们会要回来吃午饭的，就决定在门口等着。等着，等着，太阳已经偏到西边山上去了，还没见这位要过生日的妹妹回家。再等到什么时候呢？明天自己也要出工，还有五分田麦子要补种，他失望地仍旧提着那篮礼物回去了，这一天弄得张开科吃了一餐很晚很晚的晚饭。
    说真的，庚大嫂这天要过生日，她老俩口并没有忘记。过去每年到这个时候总得要吃点什么的，还少不了有些人来客往。今年她们早半个月前就计划好了要打破老例，一清早，俩口子带上饭菜就跟组里的十五个人上山铲草皮去了。光这一天，全组就积了四百五十担草皮肥。
    农具脱销了
    平江县对于湖北红安县的那个领导方法是反映得最快的。人民日报的消息一出来，办社干部就四路买锄头了。同志们都决心自己买一套农具来搞试验田。11月13日全县一千八百多人的干部会一结束，县城供销社的农具就被抢购一空。干部到乡以后，就有十一个分销店的农具被买光了。下乡干部对农具的需要量是很大的，平均每个人都要买个三套到四套。东塔乡干部胡子加一个人就买了三把大、小锄头，一担箢箕，加上蓑衣、斗笠一共六样东西。全县下乡干部下乡三天，就买了上七千件农具，瓮江乡供销社的锄头、搭耙、蓑衣、斗笠、箢箕、粪桶、草鞋等几乎样样脱销。
    现在群众都反映干部变了。枚仙乡就有人说：“过去干部三个子：脚上鞋袜子，手上红本子，走路官架子；现在干部三个头：赤脚光着头，手上大锄头，生产老带头。”团山乡在11月17日晚上召开的一次四百二十多人的乡社干部会，每人都自动地带了一把锄头来，会开了半点钟，乡的党委书记彭光初一声喊上山，带动大家一气就挖了二十亩油茶山。下乡的干部都这么说：“这回我们自己有了家伙就方便了，我要下决心在锄头底下挖出金子来。”
    第一面旗帜
    在离平江城四里远的北湖农业社第一队靠路边的一丘田中间，插着一块木牌，上面写着：“王效良、史夫桂丰产试验田，一亩六分，保证产谷一千五百斤。”这就是平江县委书记王效良和监委书记史夫桂两人的试验田。
    为了要搞试验田，王效良挑选了三、四天，才选好老农陈友仁当自己的师傅。他说“友老（对陈友仁的尊称）作了三十多年田，受了一辈子的苦，他现在愿意把什么本事都拿出来的”。可是友老当时却是那样想：“给县委书记当师傅不是好玩的，搞不好不但对不起政委，还得挨群众批评。”王效良跟他谈了又谈，才把合同订下来。当别的社员们还在收拾晚稻禾草的时候，王效良和史夫桂两人就在试验田上挖好一个能装七百石肥的粪凼了，这是全洞第一个出现的大粪凼。
    现在友老经常对人说：“王书记学习多耐心，作南方的田凼子，一教就会。”有时，小伙子们随便翻弄了这个粪凼里的草皮，友老就会训他们一顿：“这是王书记手上磨出血泡铲下的，那点也不比你们差。”可小伙子们劲头也来了，他们说：“我们就来比比看，只看谁搞成了才算。”
    他再也呆不下去了！
    早在一个月以前，在瓮江乡所有被抽调下乡的干部，都各人担着棉被下乡落户去了。可是瓮江供销社一个被抽调下乡的干部潘均来却总是要睡在机关里，迟迟地不肯把铺盖卷起来。他买的那套锄头、箢箕也每天陪着他在房里睡觉，没有用武之地。
    时间一天天的过去了，潘均来看见瓮江办事处党的工委会主任李少良，每天开完会了还要担粪、铲草皮。手里磨出血泡，还在喊轻伤不下火线，又看见全乡群众起早摸黑忙着出工。和他最熟悉的那个贫农社员向致仁有一天还跑过来亲切地问他：“潘同志，几时搬到社里来，我来帮你搬铺盖。”
    这对潘均来是多么深刻的刺激呵！他再也忍不住了，就在13日的半夜里，他奋然地从床上爬起来，挑着棉被，挂上锄头和蓑衣等，喊开机关的大门就奔出去了。
    天还没亮，潘均来就到了向致仁的家里，向致仁热忱地接待着他，亲切地对潘均来说：“什么事都是学出来的。我一定跟你一边办社一边合着搞一丘试验田。无论有多大困难，我们相跟上干。”
    潘均来这回的确可以说得是最后一担絮被下乡，也是这回他才真正是把心也带下去了。
