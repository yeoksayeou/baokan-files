　　“A State of Confusion” [Note]
　　Fu Shi
　　The West is ringing and clanging,
　　A soul-summoning banner
    Accompanies the shaking of bronze bells,
　　Vice President Nixon
    Has no idle hands,
　　Ringing bells and waving banners to call back the souls and calm the fears of his own people.
　　Poor guy, his mouth is hanging open in an "A" shape,
　　Spewing out words like "defeat," "sorrow," "crying" without end:
　　Don't be like this, "Americans"!
　　"We have indeed failed"!
　　"We will continue to fail"!
　　Don't just cry your eyes out for that "Vanguard."
　　Don't be afraid that "a state of confusion" will envelop Washington,
　　Don't be afraid that "the most serious moment in history" has arrived,
　　Remember?
　　"The United States has always possessed greater destructive power than Russia,"
　　Hmph! "Except for the United States' technology,
　　The whole world is backward peasants"!
　　Clang, clang, clang...
　　What?! North Atlantic Treaty Organization partners,
　　Shadows are also covering your faces!
　　Alas! England and France are even arguing with me to death!
　　West Germany, you're as hard as an iron nail!
　　Small allies, you're unhappy again about the U.S. military bases!
　　Oh dear, France! You're acting "neutral" with me,
　　And pulling West Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium into developing atomic weapons separately!
　　Folks! Is our "anti-communist" alliance,
　　Going to be blasted into nothing by that ill-omened star?
　　Do you really believe: "To be with the United States,
　　Is the same as reporting to King Yama"?
　　It won't be! Please everyone, calm down!
　　Our Dulles has "amazing ideas" to offer,
　　To make our "new life and unity" able to "rely on each other,"
　　Then launching a war will certainly lead to victory!
　　However, please don't be suspicious of me,
　　Especially don't think about that "satellite" that smashed our nest.
    [Note] The quotations are all from the December 10th People's Daily and Beijing Daily. The quotations in the second section are all said by Nixon, and the quotations later on are from newspapers in the United States, Britain, and France.

### “一片混乱”

专栏：

　　“一片混乱”〔注〕
　　俯拾
　　西方一阵叮令叮令，
　　一条招魂幡
    伴着摇响的铜铃，
　　副总统尼克松
    双手没有个闲，
　　摇铃摇幡给自己人叫魂、压惊。
　　难为了那张嘴巴儿挂成了A形，
　　吐出的词儿“败北”“悲”“哭”不停：
　　不要这样呀！“美国人”，
　　“我们确实失败”！
　　“我们今后还要失败”！
　　不要光为这颗“先锋”哭红眼睛。
　　不要怕“一片混乱”罩笼华盛顿，
　　不要怕“历史上最严重的时刻”已经来临，
　　记得么？
　　“美国始终拥有比俄国更大的破坏力”，
　　哼！“除美国有技术之外，
　　全世界都是落后农民”！
　　叮令叮令叮的令……
　　怎么？！北大西洋集团伙计呀，
　　你们的脸上也笼罩上阴影！
　　咳！英、法呀，竟和我吵的要命！
　　西德，你也硬的像铁钉！
　　小盟国，你们又为美军基地不高兴！
　　哎哟法国！对我闹起“中立”性，
　　还拉西德、意、荷、卢、比另搞原子兵！
　　伙计们！我们的“反共”同盟，
　　难道就给那颗灾星炸的化为零？
　　难道真相信：“和美国一道，
　　就等于到阎王老子那里报了名”。
　　不会的！请大家心定一定！
　　咱们杜勒斯有“惊人的主意”奉敬，
　　要使我们“新的生命和团结”能“互相依赖”，
　　那时发动战争定能打赢！
　　不过，请诸位对我千万不要多疑，
　　特别不要想起那颗砸破老窝的“卫星”。
