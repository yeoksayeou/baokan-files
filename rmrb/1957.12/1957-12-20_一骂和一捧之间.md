	Between Scolding and Flattery

	These past few days, many major newspapers in West Germany have greatly praised Adenauer's speech at the NATO Paris conference. For example, the highly influential "Die Welt" said that Adenauer's speech was "full of hope and tried to keep up with the times." This newspaper even said that a new and proactive Adenauer had suddenly appeared.

	Why are these newspapers cheering Adenauer so loudly? It turns out that it is because Adenauer advocated at the Paris conference that negotiations should be conducted with the Soviet Union through diplomatic channels.

	Generally speaking, recently Adenauer has been criticized by newspapers much more often, especially when he stubbornly followed the United States in advocating the Cold War rhetoric.

	Adenauer has his own plans in making this proposal at the Paris conference, and West German newspapers also have their specific purposes in exaggerating their praise of Adenauer. But in any case, from the West German newspapers' scolding and flattery, Adenauer's future direction, some lessons should be learned.

    一骂和一捧之间
    这几天西德许多主要的报纸对阿登纳在北大西洋集团巴黎会议上的发言大为捧场。例如：影响极大的“世界报”说：阿登纳的发言是“充满希望，并且设法跟上时代潮流”的。这家报纸甚至说，一个新的积极的阿登纳突然出现了。
    这些报纸为何这样给阿登纳大声喝采呢？原来是因为阿登纳在巴黎会议上主张应当通过外交途径和苏联进行谈判。
    一般说来，最近阿登纳挨到报纸的责骂是要多得多，特别是当他顽固地跟随美国鼓吹冷战调子的时候。
    阿登纳在巴黎会议上作此主张，自有他的打算，西德报纸对阿登纳这样言过其实的吹捧也还有其特定的目的。但是无论如何，西德报纸这样的一骂一捧，阿登纳何去何从，从这里面应当可以悟出一点道理。
