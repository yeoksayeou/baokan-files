Notes

    No Common Language
    The Indonesian government's takeover of Dutch enterprises that had long been sucking the blood and sweat of the people is entirely justified and reasonable. However, Dulles is shouting that Indonesia's "order" is in "chaos."
    The same thing, "A gentleman speaks of what is right; a petty man speaks of what is strange." This is what it means.

    印度尼西亚政府接管了长期吸吮人民血汗的荷兰企业，这是完全正当合理的。但是，杜勒斯却大喊印度尼西亚的“秩序”“混乱”了。
    同样一件事，“君子道其常，小人道其怪”，此之谓也。
