　　Implement the National Agricultural Program, Organize a Leap in Production
　　National Agricultural Work Conference Opens

　　Xinhua News Agency, December 9th. The National Agricultural Work Conference opened in Beijing on the 9th. This is a conference to organize a leap forward in national agricultural production.

　　The conference will summarize the national agricultural production and the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan this year, along with the basic experience gained. Based on the principle of developing industry with priority given to heavy industry, and developing industry and agriculture simultaneously, the conference will study the national agricultural production plan for the next year and during the second Five-Year Plan, discuss the specific plans for implementing the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), and exchange experiences in formulating these plans.

　　Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan spoke at the meeting. He first explained the principle of developing industry with priority given to heavy industry, and developing industry and agriculture simultaneously, illustrating the important position of agricultural production in socialist construction. He pointed out that industry and agriculture support and cooperate with each other, like two legs of a person. Lameness will prevent smooth and rapid progress. Liao Luyan said that during the first Five-Year Plan, national agricultural production achieved tremendous accomplishments and development. However, compared with the rapidly developing industry and the needs of people's lives and national construction, the development speed of agriculture in our country is still lagging behind. Therefore, agricultural production must strive to catch up, and the work tasks of the agricultural sector are quite arduous.

　　Minister Liao Luyan analyzed the favorable and unfavorable conditions for agricultural production in our country. He said that insufficient arable land, serious natural disasters, backward technical conditions, and more difficulties in reclaiming wasteland are unfavorable factors in increasing agricultural production in our country. However, the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the realization of agricultural cooperativization, the large labor force, the farmers' diligence and thrift, their rich practical experience in production, their high level of awareness after being tempered by a long period of revolutionary struggle, and their organization according to socialist principles, which has unleashed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, are the most important favorable conditions. At the same time, the natural conditions in our country are generally good. The organized collective strength can fight against nature and turn some unfavorable factors into favorable ones. The state's support for agriculture, especially industrial support for agriculture, such as a substantial increase in chemical fertilizers during the second Five-Year Plan, agricultural cooperativization has been in place for two years, and the vast masses and cadres have also accumulated relatively rich experience and lessons in cooperative management, improving farming techniques, and implementing various production increase measures. These are all favorable factors for increasing agricultural production in our country. Minister Liao Luyan pointed out that it is necessary to adequately estimate these favorable factors, overcome conservative ideas, and take various measures to fully utilize all favorable factors, and turn unfavorable factors into favorable ones. Grasp the advanced models with more and faster production increases to promote the general situation, delve into the areas with less and slower production increases or even production declines, find the causes and key factors for increasing production, and then formulate production increase measures based on these key factors, concentrate efforts to implement them, so as to enable these areas with less and slower production increases or even production declines to achieve leap forward development.

　　Minister Liao Luyan said that from the province to the special district, county, district, township, and agricultural cooperative, each level must, in accordance with the spirit of being both active and fully reliable, formulate specific plans for implementing the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) in stages, batches, and steps. The plan must not only have production increase targets, but also have various specific economic, technical, and administrative measures taken to achieve the targets. The Ministry of Agriculture and agricultural departments at all levels must formulate specific implementation plans for each of the forty articles that fall under the jurisdiction of the agricultural sector. The plans formulated through the methods of airing views, debates, and the mass line, combining top-down and bottom-up approaches, will play a huge role in promoting the leap forward development of agricultural production.

　　Finally, Liao Luyan also proposed to hold this meeting well in the spirit of rectification, airing views, and debates.

　　This meeting was convened by the Ministry of Agriculture. More than 200 people attended the meeting, including the heads of agriculture and animal husbandry departments (bureaus) of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the responsible party and government officials of some special districts and counties with more and faster agricultural production increases, and representatives from relevant central departments and agricultural science and education institutions in various regions. The meeting is expected to last for about ten days.

　　实现农业纲要　组织生产跃进
　　全国农业工作会议开幕
    新华社9日讯　全国农业工作会议9日在北京开幕。这是一次组织全国农业生产跃进发展的会议。
    会议要总结今年全国的农业生产和第一个五年计划的执行情况和基本经验；根据在优先发展重工业的基础上发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，研究明年和第二个五年计划期间的全国农业生产规划，讨论实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的具体规划和交流制定这些规划的经验。
    农业部部长廖鲁言在会上讲了话。他首先解释了在优先发展重工业的基础上发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，说明了农业生产在社会主义建设中的重要地位。并且指出：工业和农业是互相支援，互相配合的，好比一个人的两条腿，跛足就不能顺利地迅速前进。廖鲁言说，第一个五年计划期间，全国农业生产获得了巨大的成就和发展，但是，同迅速发展的工业相比，同人民生活和国家建设的需要相比较，我国的农业发展速度还是落后了一步；所以，农业生产必须努力赶上去，农业部门的工作任务是相当艰巨的。
    廖鲁言部长分析了我国农业生产的有利条件和不利条件。他说，耕地不足、自然灾害严重、技术条件落后、开垦荒地的困难较多等，是我国农业增产中的不利因素；但是，中国共产党的正确领导，农业合作化的实现，众多的劳动力，农民勤劳俭朴、有丰富的生产实践经验、经过长期革命斗争锻炼，觉悟比较高，又已经按照社会主义的原则组织起来，发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，这是一个最重要的有利条件，同时我国的自然条件一般说来是比较好的，组织起来的集体力量同自然作斗争，还可以把一些不利的因素变成有利的因素；国家对于农业的支援，特别是工业对农业的支援，例如化学肥料在第二个五年计划期间将有很大的增加；农业合作化已经有了两年的历史，广大群众和干部在合作社的经营管理、改进耕作技术和推行各项增产措施方面，也积累了比较丰富的经验和教训；这都是我国农业增产的有利因素。廖鲁言部长指出，必须足够地估计这些有利的因素克服保守思想，采取各种措施来充分利用各项有利因素，并且变不利因素为有利因素。抓住增产较多较快的先进的典型，来推动一般，深入增产不多不快甚至减产的地方，找出原因和增产关键然后针对这些关键定出增产措施，集中力量贯彻执行，从而使这些农业增产不多不快甚至减产的地方获得跃进的发展。
    廖鲁言部长说，从省到专区、县、区、乡和农业社，逐级都要根据既积极又充分可靠的精神，定出分期、分批、分步骤地实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的具体规划，规划不仅要有增产指标，还要有为实现指标所采取的经济的、技术的和行政的各种具体措施。四十条纲要中属于农业部门主管业务的各条，农业部和各级农业厅局必须定出具体实施的规划。通过鸣放辩论、群众路线的方式，自上而下、自下而上相结合，制定出来的规划，对于农业生产跃进的发展，将起巨大的推动作用。
    最后，廖鲁言还提出，要用整风的精神，鸣放辩论的方式，来开好这次会议。
    这次会议是由农业部召开的。出席会议的有各省、市、自治区的农业、畜牧厅（局）的负责人，某些农业增产较多较快较好的专区和县的党政负责人，和中央有关部门及各地农业科学、教育机构的代表等二百多人。会议预计进行十天左右。
