Mountain Area Development Has a Bright Future

　　The call for "going to the countryside and up to the mountains" and "facing the mountain areas" put forward by the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has been warmly supported by the broad masses of cadres and people. The Rural Work Department of the CPC Central Committee recently held a symposium on mountain area production, actively mobilizing forces from all sides to support the construction of mountain areas. Various provinces have transferred outstanding cadres to mountain areas, and many cadres sent to lower levels have also volunteered to participate in mountain area production. These facts have greatly strengthened the forces for mountain area construction and greatly inspired the production enthusiasm of the people in mountain areas.

    Why should we vigorously develop and support mountain area construction?

    Mountain area production occupies an important position in China's national economic construction. One of China's characteristics is its large population, limited arable land, and large mountain area. The national mountain area accounts for about two-thirds of the total land area. According to a preliminary survey of twenty-one provinces (excluding Tibet, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia, the same below), mountain and semi-mountain areas account for approximately 62% of the total area of the twenty-one provinces. The population, cultivated land, and grain output in these areas account for about one-third of the national total. Oil crops, dried fruits, fresh fruits, livestock, animal products, minerals, local specialties, and medicinal materials are all or mostly produced in mountain areas. In particular, timber, which is an important material for national basic construction and people's livelihood, is mainly supplied from mountain area logging. Many products from mountain areas are not only important industrial raw materials, but also important export goods. Developing mountain area production is an important way to develop the national economy and improve people's lives.

    So, what guiding principles and methods should be adopted for the construction of mountain areas?

    Our goal in building mountain areas is to transform the currently economically and culturally backward mountain areas into new socialist mountain areas that are economically and culturally advanced, prosperous, happy, and healthy. In order to achieve this goal, according to the provisions of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program and the current situation of mountain areas, the guiding principle for developing mountain area production and construction should be to implement a combination of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, mining, and sideline occupations in a planned and localized manner on the basis of doing a good job in soil and water conservation and actively increasing the production of grain and oil crops, so that multiple economies can develop in an all-round way.

    In order to achieve this guiding principle, we must first grasp the complex and diverse characteristics of mountain area production. In particular, we must attach importance to the implementation of diversified operations that combine agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, mining, sideline occupations, and local specialties, so that they can be combined with each other, support each other, and develop in an all-round way. Any single-minded and one-sided ideas in production and management must be avoided.

    Secondly, the leadership of mountain area production must pay attention to adapting to local conditions and historical circumstances, opposing cutting off history, and opposing generalization.

    Thirdly, all mountain areas must firmly grasp the important link of grain production. We must strive for self-sufficiency in grain and oil crops with a surplus; strive to support the plains and cities more; and gradually increase reserves. Mountain areas with inconvenient transportation and difficulties in external transfers can brew or process locally according to national needs. A small number of mountain areas that currently cannot be self-sufficient in grain should also strive to achieve most of self-sufficiency in order to reduce grain imports.

    Fourthly, forestry production should generally be a major project in mountain area production (including timber forests and special economic forests). At present, timber harvesting in our country is increasing, while timber resources are insufficient. The restoration and development of special economic forests has also been relatively slow in recent years. This situation must be changed quickly. The current task is first to take good care of existing forests and use them fully and rationally; at the same time, we must vigorously carry out afforestation and forest cultivation, and implement timely regeneration of logged areas. Afforestation mainly relies on cooperatives; at the same time, state-owned afforestation should also be carried out in a planned way. In some areas, state and cooperative joint afforestation can be adopted. The focus of state-owned afforestation, in addition to building various protective forests, is mainly on building timber forests, but also on developing some economic forests. Cooperative afforestation should plant timber forests, special economic forests, and fuel wood forests according to local conditions and needs, and pay attention to combining long-term forest types with short-term crop production, so that short-term production serves long-term production.

    Fifthly, doing a good job in soil and water conservation is a basic condition for the development of various types of production in mountain areas, and it is also a fundamental way to eradicate water disasters and ensure the development of water conservancy. In mountain areas, all agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, local specialties, mining production, and the development of transportation construction must consistently abide by the principle of maintaining soil and water. In all areas with serious soil erosion, work must be carried out actively and in a planned way in accordance with the principles of overall planning, comprehensive management, and centralized management.

    Sixthly, comprehensive planning is an important guarantee for the smooth development of mountain area production. Those who have carried out mountain area production planning in the past should continuously revise it based on practical experience and new circumstances; those who have not carried out mountain area production planning must seize the time to do it earnestly. Mountain area production is comprehensive and must be planned comprehensively and arranged uniformly. Only through reasonable planning can land be used to its fullest extent, people be used to their talents, and materials be used to their fullest. Experience has proven that to do a good job in production planning, it is necessary to truly mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and fully discuss it; at the same time, it is necessary to implement the principle of combining leadership with the masses, so that the plan not only has the correct direction, but also fully taps potential, so that the plan formulated is practical and becomes the goal of struggle for the broad masses.

    In order to ensure the smooth progress of these tasks, we must also widely and deeply publicize the great significance and beautiful prospects of building mountain areas among all the people and cadres, and publicize that supporting the construction of mountain areas is the glorious task of the entire people and the entire party; encourage going to the mountains, commend model deeds of participating in mountain area production, advocate the spirit of hard struggle, and establish the viewpoint of long-term construction of mountain areas.

    Developing mountain area construction is a long-term cause, and the potential of mountain areas is also infinite. Without a strong drive, without a creative spirit that overcomes all difficulties and bravely moves forward, the goal of building mountain areas cannot be achieved. Conservative thinking and the lazy thinking of "sitting and eating from the mountains" must be opposed, and all erroneous views that underestimate mountain area work must be thoroughly criticized.

    With the gradual development of mountain area construction, whether various policies and measures related to mountain area production, such as consolidating and improving agricultural cooperatives, rewarding labor, protecting forests, and policies in terms of prices and taxation, can be correctly implemented often plays a major role in the development of production. It is necessary to constantly educate cadres, study and inspect the implementation of various policies related to mountain area production, and improve and strengthen policy concepts. Necessary and possible measures should also be taken economically and technically. Although the construction of mountain areas mainly relies on the strength of cooperatives and the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses, the help of the state cannot be ignored. Since mountain area production has a long turnover time, the proportion of mountain areas should be appropriately increased when allocating agricultural investment and production loans in the future. In terms of reclaiming and developing oil crops, building major transportation roads, and establishing small-scale industries and processing industries, it is necessary to give mountain areas possible support economically and technically, depending on the circumstances. Relevant departments must send technicians to the mountains in a planned way, and hold short-term training courses for various technicians near the mountains according to the needs of the mountains, in order to solve the current difficulties in mountain area production technology.

    Since mountain area construction is an arduous task of socialist construction, it includes economic and cultural work in all aspects. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen leadership, make unified arrangements, and do a good job in organization. At present, special attention should be paid to mobilizing cadres to go to the mountains, using them reasonably in a planned way, and equipping them with some more capable cadres as leading backbones. The staff, young students, and working masses who have already gone to the mountains must be quickly and appropriately arranged for work and put into production as soon as possible. The work of various departments supporting mountain areas must also be divided and responsible, and cooperate closely under the unified leadership of local party and government.

    The bugle call of "marching towards the mountain areas" has already sounded. As long as we carry forward the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle, resolutely implement the central government's guiding principles and instructions on mountain area construction, closely rely on the working masses of the mountain areas, and strive to overcome difficulties, we will surely be able to build our vast mountain areas into progressive, prosperous, and happy new socialist mountain areas.

### 山区建设有远大的前途

　　山区建设有远大的前途
    党的八届三中全会所提出的“下乡上山”“面向山区”的号召，受到了广大的干部和群众的热烈拥护。中共中央农村工作部最近召开了山区生产座谈会，积极地动员各方面的力量，支援山区的建设。各省纷纷把优秀干部调到山区，许多下放干部也自告奋勇地要求参加山区生产。这些事实大大地加强了山区建设的力量，大大地鼓舞了山区人民的生产热情。
    为什么要大力开展和支援山区建设呢？
    山区生产在我国国民经济建设中占有重大地位。我国特点之一是人口多，耕地少，山区面积大。全国山区面积，大约要占国土总面积三分之二。根据最近二十一个省的初步调查（西藏、新疆、青海、内蒙古未计，下同），山区和半山区的面积约占二十一省总面积的62％。这些地区的人口、耕地和粮食产量占全国三分之一左右。油料作物、干果、鲜果、牲畜、畜产品、矿产、土特产、药材等，全部或者大部产在山区。特别是国家基本建设的重要资材和民生需用的木材，主要是从山区采伐供应。山区有许多产品，不仅是重要的工业原料，也是重要的出口物资。发展山区生产是发展国民经济和改善人民生活的重要途径。
    那末，建设山区应该采取怎样的方针和方法呢？
    我们建设山区的目标是：把现在经济上、文化上落后的山区建设成为经济上、文化上进步、繁荣、康乐、幸福的社会主义的新山区。为了实现这个目标，根据全国农业发展纲要修正草案的规定和山区当前的现状，发展山区生产建设的方针，应该是在做好水土保持工作和积极增产粮食、油料的基础上，有计划地因地制宜地实行农业、林业、牧业、矿业、副业互相结合，使多种经济全面发展的方针。
    为了实现这个方针，首先要抓住山区生产复杂多样的特点。特别要重视实行农、林、牧、矿、副业和土特产相结合的多种经营，使它们互相结合，相互支援，全面发展。在生产经营上任何单一化的片面想法都必须避免。
    其次，对山区生产的领导，必须注意根据当地的现实情况和历史情况，因地制宜，反对割断历史，反对一般化。
    第三，一切山区都要抓紧粮食生产这一重要环节。必须力争粮食和油料自给而有余；争取更多地支援平原和城市，并且逐步增加储备。交通不便外调困难的山区，可以按照国家需要就地酿造或加工。少数山区目前粮食确实不能自给的，也应该争取做到大部分自给，以减少粮食调进。
    第四，林业生产一般地应该是山区生产的一个主要项目（包括用材林，特种经济林）。我国目前木材采伐日益增多，而木材资源不足。特种经济林的恢复和发展近几年来也比较慢。这种情况必须很快加以改变。目前的任务，首先是要把现有的林木保管得好，并且充分地合理使用；同时必须大力进行造林、育林，及时地实行迹地更新。造林主要依靠合作社；同时也应该有计划地进行国营造林。有些地区可采取国家与合作社合营造林。国营造林的重点，除了营造各种防护林以外，主要的是营造用材林，但也要发展一些经济林。合作社造林，要按当地条件和需要分别种植用材林、特种经济林、薪炭林，并且注意使长期林种和短期作物生产相结合，使短期生产为长期生产服务。
    第五，做好水土保持工作是发展山区各种生产的基本条件，也是达到根绝水患、保证发展水利的治本办法。在山区一切农、林、牧、副业和土特产、采矿业的生产，交通建设的发展，必须一致遵守保持水土的原则。在一切水土流失严重的地区，必须按照全面规划、综合治理和集中治理的原则，有计划地积极地进行工作。
    第六，全面规划，是顺利开展山区生产的一项重要保证。过去已经进行过山区生产规划的，应该根据实践中的经验和新的情况，不断加以修正；没有进行山区生产规划的，必须争取时间切实进行。山区生产是综合性的，必须全面规划，统一安排。只有经过合理的规划，才能使地尽其利、人尽其才、物尽其用。经验证明，要做好生产规划，必须切实发动群众，依靠群众，充分讨论，同时必须实行领导与群众相结合的原则，使规划既有正确方向，又能充分挖掘潜力，从而使制订出来的规划切合实际，成为广大群众的奋斗目标。
    要想保证这些工作的顺利进行，我们还要在全体人民中和干部中广泛深入地宣传建设山区的重大意义和美丽前景，宣传支援建设山区是全民全党的光荣任务；鼓励上山，表扬参加山区生产的模范事迹，提倡艰苦奋斗的作风，树立长期建设山区的观点。
    开展山区建设是长期的事业，山区的潜力也是无穷无尽的。没有一股劲，没有排除万难、勇往向前的创造精神，就不能达到建设山区的目的。保守思想和“坐吃山空”的懒汉思想必须反对，一切轻视山区工作的错误观点都要彻底受到批判。
    随着山区建设的逐渐开展，有关山区生产的各种政策措施，如巩固提高农业合作社、奖励劳动、保护林木以及在价格、税收等方面的政策措施能否正确地贯彻执行，往往对发展生产起重大作用。必须经常教育干部，研究和检查有关山区生产的各种政策贯彻执行的情况，提高和加强政策观念。在经济上、技术上也要采取必要的和可能的措施。建设山区虽然主要依靠合作社的力量，依靠劳动群众的积极性和创造性，但是也不能忽视国家的帮助。由于山区生产周转时间较长，今后在分配农业投资、生产贷款的时候，应该适当地增加山区的比例。在垦复和发展油料作物，修建主要交通道路，兴办小型工业和加工业等方面，必须分别情况，在经济上、技术上给予山区以可能的支援。各有关部门必须有计划地派遣技术人员上山，根据山区需要，就近在山区举办各种技术人员的短期训练班，以解决当前山区生产技术的困难。
    由于山区建设是社会主义建设的一项繁重任务，它包括经济上、文化上各方面的工作。因此，必须加强领导，统一安排，做好组织工作。目前特别要注意的，是要动员干部上山，要有计划地合理地使用他们，要配备一部分能力较强的干部充当领导骨干。已经上山的工作人员、青年学生和劳动群众，必须很快地适当安排工作及早投入生产。各有关部门支援山区的工作也必须在地方党政统一领导下分工负责，密切合作。
    “向山区进军”的号角已经响起来了。只要发扬艰苦奋斗的革命优良传统，坚决贯彻中央有关山区建设的方针指示，紧紧地依靠山区的劳动群众，努力克服困难，我们一定能够把我国的广阔的山区建设成进步、繁荣、幸福的社会主义的新山区。
