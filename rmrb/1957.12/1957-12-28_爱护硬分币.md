    Cherish Hard Currency Coins
    Recently, I have seen some children playing with hard currency coins as toys, such as throwing them against stones, using them to toss into "holes," and sliding them to see how far they go; some even use them for gambling. In our Longnan area, there has been this habit in the past: using coins as gambling tools around the Spring Festival. This will inevitably accelerate the wear and tear of coins, shorten their lifespan, and cause losses to the country. I think: parents should educate their children and immediately stop any acts of playing with hard currency coins; schools, especially primary school teachers, should also conduct "protect hard currency coins" education among students, so that they can establish a concept of cherishing hard currency coins in their minds. Only when everyone pays attention can hard currency coins remain bright, beautiful, and long-lasting.

    爱护硬分币
    最近，我看见有些孩子把硬分币当玩具玩弄，比如到石块上去摔，把它用来投“窝子”、溜远近等等；甚至用它来赌博。我们龙南这个地方，过去就有这个习惯：春节前后用硬币作为赌博工具进行赌博。这样，一定会加快硬币的损耗，缩短它的寿命，使国家遭受损失。我想：做家长的人应该对自己的孩子进行教育，发现有玩弄硬分币的行为，应该立即制止；学校，尤其是小学的老师们也应在学生中进行“保护硬分币”的教育，使他们从思想上树立爱护硬分币的观念。只有大家重视，硬分币才能长久地光亮、美丽。
