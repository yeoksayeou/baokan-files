Dear Chairman, Dear Comrades:

    Morocco has recently won its independence at a very high price. In order to eliminate the various remnants left over from the colonial system, our young labor movement is encountering many difficulties. Nevertheless, the Moroccan Labor Union accepted your friendly invitation and sent me here to convey the fraternal greetings of all Moroccan workers.

    The Moroccan workers pay attention to the experience gained by the great All-China Federation of Trade Unions in its work with sympathy and admiration. How touching this conference is, with representatives of more than ten million workers here frankly and enthusiastically discussing issues, which further proves the maturity of the Chinese working class, and that it should give more support and encouragement to all workers, especially those in countries that have just freed themselves from colonial rule, on the road to striving for progress and human dignity.

    The Moroccan working class recognizes its responsibilities and the seriousness of the international situation. Although our social systems are different, we are willing to learn from your good example and contribute our share to promote the rapprochement of sincere laborers in the two camps and strive for genuine unity. Only in this way can the Cold War that spreads from one continent to another be eliminated, and only in this way can the various provocative conspiracies taking place in the Middle East and Near East be stopped, especially in Algeria, where the people have been experiencing the inhuman war waged against them by French imperialists for two years.

    The united workers' aspiration is to demand that leaders of all countries use the huge expenditures on arms expansion for the welfare of mankind, and to improve people's living standards and develop the economy.

    I am convinced that a conference like today's, attended by representatives from countries with different social systems, will definitely help promote the sincere desire of many countries for peaceful coexistence.

    Dear comrades, before ending my speech, please allow me to extend my congratulations to the organizers of the conference. Their successful initiative has brought us together, enabling us to understand each other better and making our unity stronger. I would like to warmly thank the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for the hospitality to all of us, and wholeheartedly wish the conference a complete victory.

    Long live international workers' solidarity!
    Long live peace!
    Long live the Chinese people!

### 摩洛哥劳工联合会代表  穆罕默德·阿布得拉札克致词

    摩洛哥劳工联合会代表
    穆罕默德·阿布得拉札克致词亲爱的主席、亲爱的同志们：
    摩洛哥最近付出很高的代价赢得了独立。为了消除殖民主义制度遗留下来的各种残余，我们年轻的工人运动正遇到很多困难。尽管如此，摩洛哥劳工联合会接受了你们的友好邀请，派我到这里来转达摩洛哥全体工人的兄弟般的敬礼。
    摩洛哥工人以同情和钦佩的心情注意着伟大的中华全国总工会在工作方面所取得的经验。这次大会是多么的动人，一千多万工人的代表们在这里坦率地、热烈地进行讨论，这就更进一步证明中国工人阶级的成熟，和它应该在争取进步和人类尊严的道路上，对一切工人，特别是刚刚摆脱殖民主义统治的国家的工人，给予更多的支持和鼓舞。
    摩洛哥工人阶级认识到自己的责任和国际局势的严重性。虽然我们的社会制度不同，但是我们愿意学习你们的良好榜样，贡献出自己的一分力量，来促使两个阵营中有诚意的劳动者的接近，争取真正的统一。只有这样，才能消除从一个大陆蔓延到另一个大陆的冷战，也只有这样，才能阻止中近东地区发生的种种挑衅阴谋。特别是阿尔及利亚，那里的人民两年来经历着法帝国主义者对他们进行的惨无人性的战争。
    团结一致的工人们的宿愿是，要求各国领导人把扩充军备的巨额开支用在人类的福利事业上，并用来提高人民的生活水平和发展经济。
    我确信，像今天这样有不同社会制度的国家代表出席的大会，一定会有助于促进许多国家要求和平共处的真诚愿望。
    亲爱的同志们，在结束我的发言前，请允许我向大会的组织者致以祝贺。他们成功的倡议把我们聚集在一起，使我们互相更加了解，并使我们的团结更有力量。我要热烈感谢中华全国总工会给我们大家的款待，并衷心地祝大会获得完全胜利。
    国际工人团结万岁！
    和平万岁！
    中国人民万岁！
