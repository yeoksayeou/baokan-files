Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch Tang Mingzhao, a friend of the former editor of the "China Weekly Review," Powell, and Vice Chairman of the Committee to Support Powell, sent a telegram to Walker, another of Powell's defense lawyers, on December 4 regarding Powell's defense lawyer, Willing, coming to China. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

    “Received your telegram of November 27.

    “As I have told you many times in the past, the Chinese and American governments must first reach an agreement on judicial assistance before Chinese witnesses can provide testimony and evidence for the Powell case. However, the U.S. government has so far not discussed the issue of judicial assistance with the Chinese government. The 'Request for Judicial Assistance' directly submitted to the Chinese Ministry of Justice by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on September 3rd was not in accordance with proper procedures, and therefore the Chinese Ministry of Justice returned the request on October 30th of this year. Now that the U.S. State Department has issued Mr. Willing a passport to come to China, it is even more necessary for the U.S. government to discuss the issue of judicial assistance with the Chinese government.

    “The Chinese authorities have authorized me to inform you that the Chinese government is prepared to raise the issue of judicial assistance at the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks in Geneva in order to reach an agreement. I hope you will do everything possible to promote the reaching of this agreement. The Chinese authorities have authorized me to inform you that they agree to Mr. Willing's entry, and the visa will be issued upon arrival. However, if Mr. Willing comes to China before the Chinese and American governments have reached an agreement on the issue of judicial assistance, the Chinese court will be unable to preside over his meeting with Chinese witnesses and the collection of evidence, and I can only contact him to discuss how to promote an agreement between the Chinese and American governments on judicial assistance, and I will indirectly provide some materials.

    “Please convey the above information to Mr. Powell.”

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 11th Dispatch: The U.S. State Department recently issued a passport to Willing, the lawyer of Powell, the former chief writer for the "China Weekly Review" in Shanghai, allowing him to come to China to collect evidence for Powell's defense. However, the U.S. government has so far not expressed its willingness to reach a judicial assistance agreement with the Chinese government, while the Chinese side has repeatedly pointed out that only by reaching such an agreement can Chinese witnesses provide testimony and evidence for the Powell case.

The measure of the U.S. State Department issuing a passport to Willing to go to China and North Korea was taken on November 20th, after previously refusing to issue a passport. San Francisco Federal District Judge Goodman ruled on November 1st that if the State Department did not allow Willing to travel to China and North Korea to investigate evidence, then the charges against Powell would be dropped after thirty days. After this, the State Department changed its attitude and agreed to issue a passport to Willing.

The U.S. authorities filed charges against Powell a year and a half ago, and he was accused of the "crime" of publishing news in Shanghai that accused the United States of carrying out aggression and germ warfare in the Korean War.

    唐明照就鲍惠尔辩护律师来华问题致电华克
    中美两国必须先达成司法协助协议
    新华社11日讯　前密勒氏评论报编辑鲍惠尔的朋友、声援鲍惠尔委员会副主席唐明照12月4日就鲍惠尔的辩护律师威林来华问题打电报给鲍惠尔的另一个辩护律师华克。电报全文如下：
    “11月27日来电悉。
    “正如我过去多次告诉你的，中美两国政府必须先达成关于司法协助的协议，中国证人才能为鲍惠尔案提供证词和证据。但是，美国政府至今没有同中国政府商谈司法协助的问题。今年9月3日美国加利福尼亚州北区区法院直接向中国司法部提出‘司法协助请求书’是不合乎正当手续的，因此中国司法部于今年10月30日将该请求书退回。现在美国国务院发给威林先生来中国的护照，因此更有必要由美国政府同中国政府商谈司法协助的问题。
    “中国当局授权我通知你，中国政府准备在日内瓦中美大使级会谈中提出司法协助的问题，以求达成协议。希望你尽一切可能推动这一协议的达成。中国当局授权我通知你，同意威林先生入境，签证在入境时补发。但是，如果威林先生在中美两国政府没有就司法协助问题达成协议以前来到中国，中国法院将无法主持他会见中国证人和搜集证据的事，而只能由我同他接触，商谈如何促成中美两国政府关于司法协助的协议，并且由我间接提供一些材料。
    “以上情况，请转告鲍惠尔先生。”
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院最近发护照给前上海密勒氏评论报主笔鲍惠尔的律师威林，允许他到中国来搜集为鲍惠尔辩护的证据。但是，美国政府至今仍然没有表示准备同中国政府达成司法协助的协议，而中国方面已经一再指出，只有达成这种协议，中国证人才能为鲍惠尔案提供证词和证据。
    美国国务院发给威林来中国和北朝鲜的护照的措施是在11月20日采取的，它以前一直拒绝发给护照。旧金山联邦地方法官古德曼曾经在11月1日判决，如果国务院不允许威林前往中国和朝鲜调查证据，那么对鲍惠尔的控诉案将在三十天以后撤销。在这以后，国务院才改变态度，同意发护照给威林。
    美国当局对鲍惠尔的控诉案是在一年半以前提出的，他被控的“罪名”是曾经在上海发表指责美国在朝鲜战争中进行侵略和细菌战的消息。
