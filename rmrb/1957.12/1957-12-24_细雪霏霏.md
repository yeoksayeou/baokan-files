　　"Snow falls on high mountains, frost hits low-lying areas." In the tenth month of the lunar calendar, the highest peak in the Yimeng Mountains, Jade Emperor Peak, has already been covered in snow for the second time. At night, the wind rushes down from the high mountains, carrying the sound of pine trees like a tiger's roar, frantically shaking the trees in the valleys and beating against the windows of the thatched cottages. Its power and sound seem to swallow up the small mountain villages nestled against the mountains and by the water.

　　At the break of dawn, the dark and heavy mountains are still hidden in thick, smoky clouds, and the Yishan Cooperative in the Yishan Mountains has already sounded a cheerful and lively bugle call. Although the young "bugler" is blowing with a flushed face, and although the bugle call is loud, it will never reach the warm beds of every cooperative member, because this advanced cooperative with hundreds of households is located in several valleys, stretching more than ten miles from north to south. But what does it matter? The farthest Banyu Brigade has also been working for some time. In front of the forest farm, on Zhanglin Mountain, there is a clanging, banging sound of splitting rocks and stones, mixed with the rhymes gathered by the mountains, overwhelming the sound of the wind and the cold. Their slogan is "Sand is hard, stone is hard, but not as hard as a pickaxe. Iron is hard, steel is hard, but not as hard as determination!" Really, think about it, this is to cut a three-mile-long aqueduct on a steep mountain slope, and dig a deep trench more than two people tall in the stone!

　　During breakfast, the wind subsided, and fine snow that melted upon contact fell from the thick clouds. Seventy-three-year-old Grandpa Zhang Zhenzhai also happily said, "Yes, the waterway we are building will last for eternity. I've lived for more than seventy years, and I've never seen water going up the mountain, turning mountain land into irrigated fields. This is truly a great joy that I never dreamed of."

　　The fine snow fell thicker and thicker, and the people worked harder and harder. Regardless of how the district chief and cooperative cadres tried to stop them, most of the cooperative members took off their cotton-padded coats and sweated even wearing only a small jacket. Demobilized soldier Zhao Yongqing simply took off his shirt and dug into the sand and stone with a "heave-ho," sparks flying from the new steel pickaxe. When others advised him to put on his clothes, he smiled with pride and said, "It's not cold! Snow is falling from the sky, but fire is rising from the ground." Old man Zhang Zhenzhai also said, "Yes, you don't feel cold when you're working." At this time, not far from them, a burst of cheers erupted. It turned out that Cheng Deting, barefoot, climbed onto a steep slope that was difficult to stand on. He dug out the first foothold there, and also marked the path of the canal with a white trace with a pickaxe. People then climbed up one after another. The steep cliff immediately turned into a lively construction site. The thorns in the cracks of the rocks swayed不停的摇摆 around them, and the advanced red flag fluttered in the wind above their heads. As long as they turned their heads, they could see the crowd deep plowing the land behind the village, the afforestation team planting trees on the top of the mountain, and even the small river of splashing water flowing down from a hundred-zhang-high cliff.

　　Following this gurgling river, not far to the east is the Tanghe Cooperative. Here, the scene is even more lively. A canal that was originally planned to be completed in more than twenty days is about to be completed in seven or eight days. Here appeared a production brigade that worked continuously for three days and three nights, finally winning the red flag. Here, more than fifty women are working every day, just like the male laborers. When party branch secretary Hou Fengde persuaded the elderly mothers to go back, Zhang Fugui's mother, who was in her sixties, said, "Those who can carry beams will carry beams, those who can carry pillars will carry pillars. If you can't carry big things, you can carry small things. If you can't carry big stones, I can carry small pieces. Hey, even swallows carry mud to build big nests." This old mother with gray hair and bright eyes picked up the carrying basket and said excitedly, "My mother begged for food, my mother-in-law begged for food, and I myself begged for food for half my life. Now I'm wearing a cotton-padded coat and have food to eat, why shouldn't I work? Why shouldn't I do it!" Really, in the small Tanghe Village, everyone's heart is boiling like boiling water. Old craftsman Zhang Wen, who hadn't picked up a chisel in ten years, also signed up to participate in water conservancy construction this winter. He educated his children and grandchildren with these words: "Young people, work hard! The Communist Party is planning for us, for us to grow more grain! In the old society, when the Kuomintang and the traitorous troops were stationed in Daguan, they forced us to dig trenches on the mountain even when it was colder than this. Now, we are working for ourselves!"

　　Let the north wind blow, let the snowflakes fly, nothing can stop this forward and heroic pace, nothing can stop the people in the mountainous areas from creating a happier and more fulfilling life. Listen, the sound of blasting rocks echoes rumblingly through the valley. The sound of ramming, powerfully flying in the wind and snow, and even in the deep of night, you can hear the clanging of the blacksmith forging pickaxes.

    细雪霏霏
    董均伦　江源
    “雪下高山，霜打洼”，阴历10月初，沂蒙山区的最高山头——玉皇顶，已经是第二次雪落松白了。夜里，风从高山上扑下，带着虎啸样的松涛声，疯狂的摇动着山洼里的树木，拍打着茅屋的窗子。那威力，那声响，好像要把那些靠山临水，小小的山庄吞没了似的。
    天蒙蒙亮，黑沉沉的群山，还隐没在浓烟一样的云雾里，沂山里的沂山社，已经响起了轻松愉快的号声。尽管那年青的“司号员”吹得满脸通红，尽管那号声再嘹亮，也绝不会传到每一个社员的热炕头上，因为这个几百户的高级社，座落在好几个山洼里，南北有十多里长啊。但这又有什么关系呢？离得最远的板峪大队，也下手多时了。林场前的掌林山上，丁丁当当，砰砰叭叭一片劈山凿石的响声，混着群山拢住的音韵，压倒了风声，压倒了寒冷。他们的口号是“沙子硬、石头硬，不如镐头硬。铁硬、钢硬，还不如决心硬！”真的，想一想吧，这是要在陡峭的山坡上劈一条三里长的引水道，在石头上挖一条两人多高的深沟啊！
    吃早饭的时候，风小了，浓云里飘下了落在身上就化的细雪。七十三岁的张振斋老大爷也欢喜的说：“是呀，咱修的这条水道，万古千秋也没有毁啊。我活了七十多岁，也没见过水上山，山地变成水浇田，这真是做梦也想不到的大喜事呀。”
    细雪越下越密，人们也越干越有劲，不管区长和社干部怎么阻拦，大多数的社员脱去了棉袄，只穿件小褂还是冒汗。复员军人赵永庆，干脆脱光了膀子，“吭嗤吭嗤”的刨着沙石，新钢的镐头，火星四冒。当别人劝他穿上衣裳时，他满脸豪气的笑着说：“不冷啊！天上下雪，地上还冒火啊。”张振斋老汉也这样说道：“是呀，干起活来就不冷了啊。”这时，在离他们不远的地方，响起了一片叫好声。原来是成得廷光着脚丫，攀上了难以立脚的陡坡。他在那里刨出了第一个脚蹬，也给从这里经过的水渠，用镐头划上了白色的印痕，人们接着纷纷的爬了上去。陡峭的崖壁，立刻变成了热闹的工地。石缝里的荆条在他们的身边不停的摇摆，优胜红旗在他们头上迎风招展。他们只要一回头，就可以望到那在庄后深翻土地的人群，也可以看到那在山头上栽树的造林队，更能看到那条从百丈高崖流下来的水花飞溅的小河。
    顺着这条哗哗发响的小河，往东走不多远，就是唐河社了。这里更是一番红火光景，本来计划二十多天才能完成的一条水渠，七、八天的工夫就快要挖成了。这里出现了连做三天三夜，终于把红旗夺到手的生产大队。这里每天都有五十多个妇女和男劳力一样在干。当社支书侯凤德劝说已经上了年纪的老妈妈回去时，六十多岁的张富贵娘说：“能担梁的担梁，能扛柱的扛柱，拿不动大的还能拿小的，抬不动大石头，俺拿碎的。嗬，燕子含泥还垒大窝啦。”这个头发斑白，眼睛明亮的老妈妈，拿起抬筐又激动的说：“俺娘讨饭，婆婆讨饭，我自己也讨了半辈子饭，如今我穿上棉袄，有了吃的，我为什么不干呢？我为什么不做呢！”真的，小小的唐河庄，人人的心里都好似开水一样的翻腾着。已经十年不拿錾子的石匠张文长老汉，今冬也报名参加水利建设了。他用这样的话教育儿孙：“年青人，好好的干哪！共产党打谱，都是为咱们呀，是为了咱多打粮食啊！在过去旧社会，国民党、汉奸队驻在大关时，比这天冷还逼着咱上山挖壕沟。现在呢，是给自己干的哪！”
    让北风飘吧，让雪花飞吧，什么也阻止不住这前进豪迈的脚步，什么也阻止不住山区的人们，创造更加幸福、美满的生活。听吧，开山的炸药声，震动得山谷隆隆发响。打夯的号子声，在风雪里有力的飞扬，便是在深夜里也能听到铁匠打镐头的丁丁当当声。
