“Lenin” Nuclear Icebreaker

    The world's first nuclear icebreaker, the "Lenin," built by the Soviet Union, has been launched. This is another major achievement for the Soviet Union in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    The "Lenin" is currently the world's largest icebreaker, with a main engine power of 44,000 horsepower, sufficient to supply electricity to a city of 500,000 people, more than double the horsepower of the American icebreaker "Glacier," previously hailed as the world's largest.

    The "Lenin" will be primarily used on the cold Soviet Northern Sea Route, and even across the Arctic, to clear ice on the route and pave the way for ordinary transport ships. Compared with ordinary icebreakers, the main advantages of this icebreaker are its long endurance, low fuel consumption, and strong icebreaking ability.

      The "Lenin" can sail continuously for 400 days, circling the Earth's equator three times, on a single fueling. A steam icebreaker can only sail for 20 days and nights per fueling, and a coal-burning ship consumes 100 tons of coal per day and night, while the "Lenin" only requires 45 centimeters (about one and a half taels on the Chinese scale) of nuclear fuel.

    Because the tonnage required to store fuel is greatly reduced, it is possible to greatly strengthen the hull's structure. Coupled with its enormous horsepower, it can open up paths in ice layers that even the most powerful icebreakers today cannot pass through.

    The heart of the nuclear icebreaker is a huge nuclear reactor. The large amount of heat generated by the reactor turns water into steam, which drives a steam turbine generator. The electricity generated here can drive three propeller electric motors with a total power of more than 30,000 kilowatts and more than 500 motors for other purposes. In addition, power stations with a power of 3,000 kilowatts each are installed at the bow and stern to supply electricity for other work and the daily life of the crew.

    Most of the operational processes on this ship, from the manipulation of the reactor's operation to the calculation of the route, are automated, without drivers or stokers. The main control panel is equipped with various automatic and remote control instruments. The duty engineer observes the operation of the reactor and manipulates the power unit from here.

    The icebreaker is equipped with various modern navigation equipment and automatic navigation devices. These devices can guide the icebreaker along the prescribed route, regardless of visibility, in any weather conditions, detect and guide it around icebergs, adjust the operation of all important machinery, and even fill out the nautical log.

    To scout ice conditions and for communication, the icebreaker also has two helicopters, with a hangar and takeoff and landing field on the stern.

    The living conditions on the "Lenin" are quite good. There are about a thousand cabins for various purposes on board. The ship is equipped with an "artificial climate" device that can automatically adjust the temperature and humidity on board.

    Pavel Ponomarev, captain of the "Lenin" nuclear icebreaker, is an outstanding Arctic navigator. He has participated in many Arctic expeditions. Twenty-five years ago, he commanded the world-famous Soviet icebreaker "Krasin" and opened up the Northern Sea Route.

    The creation of the nuclear icebreaker has opened up broad prospects for the application of atomic energy in transportation. Soviet scientists have now begun to study the atomic power units of whaling ships, oil tankers, and ocean-going passenger and cargo ships, and have made preliminary designs for atomic locomotives. The Soviet Union's atomic-powered aviation device has completed its first flight test. In the future, the application of atomic energy in this area will surely become increasingly widespread.

　　“列宁号”原子破冰船
    苏联建造的世界上第一艘原子破冰船“列宁号”下水了。这是苏联在和平利用原子能方面的又一重大成就。
    “列宁号”是目前世界上最大的破冰船，单是它主要发动机的功率就有四万四千马力，足以供应一个五十万人口的城市的用电，比在今天以前曾经号称世界最大的美国破冰船“冰河号”的马力整整大了一倍。
    “列宁号”将主要用在寒冷的苏联北方海运线上，乃至横越北极，铲开航线上的冰层，为普通运输船开路。与普通破冰船相比，这艘破冰船的主要优点是续航力远，消耗燃料少，破冰能力强。
      “列宁号”上一次燃料，就足以连续航行四百天，绕地球赤道三圈。而蒸汽破冰船每上一次燃料只能航行二十昼夜，烧煤的船每昼夜要消耗一百吨煤，而“列宁号”则仅需四十五公分（约合中国秤一两半）核燃料。
    由于储存燃料所需的吨位大大减少了，就有可能大大加强船身的坚固程度，再加上它的马力巨大，它就可以在现在最强大的破冰船也无法通过的厚冰层中开辟道路。
    原子破冰船的心脏部分是一个巨大的原子核反应堆。反应堆产生的大量的热使水化成蒸汽，推动蒸汽涡轮发电机。这里发出的电可以带动总功率为三万瓩以上的三台螺旋桨用电动机和五百多台供其他用途的马达。另外在船头和船尾还分别装有功率各为三千瓩的发电站，供应其它工作和船员日常生活所需要的电力。
    这艘船上绝大部分操作过程，从反应堆工作的操纵到航线的绘算都是自动化的，没有司机和司炉。在总操纵台上设有各种自动装置和遥控装置的仪器。值班工程师就在这里观察反应堆的工作，操纵动力装置。
    破冰船上设有各种现代化航行设备和自动导航装置。这些装置可以在任何气候条件下不管能见度如何而引导破冰船按照规定航线航行，探察并引导它绕过冰山，可以调节一切重要机械的工作，甚至还可以填写航海日志。
    为了侦察冰情和联络，破冰船上还有两架直升飞机，船尾上设有飞机库和起飞降落场。
    “列宁号”的生活条件是相当好的。船上约有一千个供各种用途的船舱。船上设有“人工气候”装置，可以自动调节船上的温度和湿度。
    “列宁号”原子破冰船船长巴维尔·波诺马烈夫是一个出色的极地航海家。他曾经参加过许多次极地考察队。在二十五年前，他就指挥过世界闻名的苏联破冰船“克拉辛号”，开辟了北海航线。
    原子破冰船的制成为原子能在交通运输方面的应用打开了广阔的远景。现在苏联科学家已经开始研究捕鲸船、油船、远洋客货船的原子动力装置，作出了原子能火车头的初步设计。而苏联的原子动力航空装置已经完成了首次飞行试验。今后原子能在这方面的应用一定会日益广泛起来。
