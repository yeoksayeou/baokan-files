　　Build the Nation Through Diligence and Thrift, Manage the Household Through Diligence and Thrift
　  Speech by Kang Keqing, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation (Abstract)
    With the rapid development of our country's socialist cause, the number of female workers participating in economic and cultural construction is increasing day by day. The number of female workers nationwide has increased from 1.5 million in 1952 to more than 3 million in 1956. In 1956, 110,000 female workers nationwide were selected as advanced producers and advanced workers. This is the glory of our working class and a good example for women across the country. In the past few years, the broad masses of female workers, together with male workers on various production fronts, have actively participated in socialist competitions, enterprise management, and national political life, greatly improving their political and ideological awareness, as well as their cultural and technical levels, making great contributions to our country's construction endeavors. We believe that in the upcoming Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, female workers will surely be able to work with all workers to better promote the fine traditions of our working class, implement the spirit of hard work and thrift in building the nation, strive to increase production, practice strict economy, and continue to improve their political and ideological awareness, as well as their cultural and technical levels, to train themselves into conscious, organized, and disciplined class fighters, and to complete and strive to overfulfill the tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
    Since liberation, under the cordial care of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, women and children's welfare undertakings in factories, mines, enterprises, and institutions have greatly developed. Many units have also adopted specific measures to protect female workers, such as improving labor equipment, implementing work-break exercises, and appropriately adjusting the work of pregnant women. This is of great significance for protecting women's labor, promoting the physical and mental health of children, and ensuring the completion of production tasks. In the future, it is still necessary to continue to gradually develop labor protection work and welfare undertakings for workers on the basis of developing production and improving social labor productivity.
    In order to further develop the welfare undertakings of workers, it is necessary to continue to closely rely on the broad masses of workers and their families, mobilize and organize the strength of the broad masses of workers and their families to solve certain problems that they can solve themselves. We believe that the broad masses of workers and workers' families will surely be able to conscientiously implement the policy of building the nation through diligence and thrift and managing the household through diligence and thrift, and make new and greater contributions to the cause of socialist construction.
    In the past few years, trade union organizations at all levels have adhered to the policy of mobilizing both male and female workers in various political and production movements, and have implemented the state's policies and decrees on protecting women. They have done a lot of work and achieved great results in raising the ideological awareness of female workers and protecting them. In the future, our women's federations should continue to cooperate closely with trade unions, care about the special problems of female workers, strengthen their socialist education, and extensively and deeply publicize and implement the policy of managing the household through diligence and thrift among workers' families, encouraging them to better manage their households, raise and educate their children, unite and help each other, maintain cleanliness and hygiene, study hard, and actively serve production and construction. We hope that all workers will cooperate with us to better carry out the work of workers' families.

　　勤俭建国　勤俭持家
　  全国妇联副主席康克清致词（摘要）
    随着我国社会主义事业的迅速发展，参加经济、文化建设的女职工日益增多了。全国女职工，已由1952年的一百五十万人，增加到1956年的三百多万人。在1956年，全国有十一万女职工被评选为先进生产者和先进工作者，这是我们工人阶级的光荣，也是我们全国妇女的好榜样。几年以来，广大的女职工，在各个生产战线上同男工们一道，积极地参加了社会主义竞赛，参加了企业管理工作，参与国家政治生活，大大地提高了自己的政治思想觉悟和文化、技术水平，对我国的建设事业，贡献了很大的力量。我们相信，在即将开始的我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划中，女职工一定能够和全体职工一道，更好地发扬我国工人阶级的优良传统，贯彻艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的精神，努力增加生产，厉行节约，继续提高政治思想觉悟和文化、技术水平，把自己锻炼成为有觉悟，有组织，有纪律的阶级战士，又多、又快、又好、又省地完成和争取超额完成第二个五年计划的任务。
    解放以来，在中国共产党和人民政府的亲切关怀下，各厂矿、企业和机关的妇女儿童福利事业，都有了很大的发展。许多单位还采取了改进劳动设备，实行工间休息，适当调动孕妇工作等保护女工的具体措施。这对于保护妇女劳动，增进儿童身心健康，保证生产任务的完成，有着重要的意义。今后，还必须继续在发展生产和提高社会劳动生产率的基础上，逐步地开展职工的劳动保护工作和福利事业。
    为了进一步发展职工的福利事业，必须继续紧紧地依靠广大职工群众和他们的家属，发动和组织广大职工和他们家属的力量，解决他们自己可以解决的某些问题。我们相信，广大职工和职工家属，一定能够认真贯彻执行勤俭建国、勤俭持家的方针，在社会主义建设事业中，做出新的更大的贡献。
    几年来，各级工会组织，在各项政治运动和生产运动中，坚持了男女职工一齐发动的方针，并且贯彻执行了国家保护妇女的政策和法令，对于提高女职工的思想觉悟和保护女职工方面做了很多工作，取得了很大的成绩。我们妇联组织，今后应该继续和工会密切配合，关心女职工的特殊问题，加强对她们的社会主义教育，在职工家属中，广泛深入地宣传贯彻勤俭持家的方针，鼓励她们更好地操持家务，教养子女，团结互助，搞好清洁卫生，努力学习，积极为生产建设服务。希望全体职工和我们共同合作，更好地开展职工家属工作。
