Wu Yuzhang, President of the Chinese People's University, visited the first group of cadres and teachers transferred from the university to the Junmin Youyi Agricultural Cooperative in Fengtai District, Beijing, today.

Upon arriving at the agricultural cooperative, the seventy-year-old Wu, leaning on his cane, went to the fields to visit the cadres and teachers who were working. Chen Yishou, who was a teaching assistant in the Revolutionary History Teaching and Research Office of Renmin University before being transferred, was sorting Chinese cabbages in the field. In the month since he was transferred, he has already earned 415 work points, which is equal to the work points earned by ordinary male cooperative members. Wu praised him for doing well. Liu Shoupeng, the leader of the transferred cadres, reported to Wu that all the cadres from the Chinese People's University transferred here had performed very well, which can be summarized in three sentences: first, they are settled in agricultural production; second, they are in high spirits and have great enthusiasm; and third, they are determined to overcome difficulties.

The veteran cooperative members and cooperative cadres of the Junmin Youyi Agricultural Cooperative also praised the transferred cadres to Wu. Some cooperative members cited many things to show that the transferred cadres had already regarded the cooperative as their own home and worked very hard; some production team leaders thanked these transferred cadres for helping them arrange production plans, which made their work more orderly and their minds clearer.

Before leaving, Wu spoke to everyone. He particularly talked about the importance of exercise in physical labor and encouraged them to continue their efforts to consolidate and develop the achievements they had already made.

The first group of teachers and cadres transferred from the Chinese People's University totaled more than 600 people. Hu Xikui, Nie Zhen, Deputy Presidents of the university, and Cui Yaoxian, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, also went to the relevant agricultural cooperatives today to visit the transferred cadres.

### 吴玉章下乡探望下放干部

　　吴玉章下乡探望下放干部
    中国人民大学校长吴玉章今天到北京丰台区军民友谊农业社探望这个学校下放的第一批干部和教师。
    七十多岁的吴老一到农业社，就扶着手杖到田里去看望正在劳动的干部和教师。下放前在人民大学革命史教研室担任助教的陈益寿，正在地里整理大白菜，他下放一个月来已经得到四百一十五个工分，和一般男社员所得的工分相等。吴老称赞他做得好。下放干部的领导人刘寿彭向吴老报告说：所有下放到这里的中国人民大学干部都表现得很好，可以用三句话来概括：第一安心农业生产，第二情绪高劲头大，第三克服困难的决心坚强。
    军民友谊农业社的老社员和社干部们也纷纷向吴老夸奖下放干部。有些社员举出许多事情说明下放干部已经把合作社当成自己的家，劳动很努力；有的生产队长感谢这些下放的干部帮助他们安排生产计划，使他们的工作有了秩序，心里更亮堂了。
    吴老在临别时向大家讲了话。他特别谈到在体力劳动中锻炼的重要性，并且勉励他们继续努力，巩固和发扬已经取得的成绩。
    中国人民大学第一批下放的教师和干部共有六百多人。这个学校的副校长胡锡奎、聂真、党委副书记崔耀先等人，今天也分别到有关农业社去看望下放的干部。
