　　After Eliminating Illiteracy

　　Recording work points and managing accounts are all done by farmers
　　The people's school is even closer than home,
　　I feel uneasy if I don't study for a day.
　　Five years have flashed by,
　　The illiterate has become a cultured person.
　　Recording work points, being an accountant,
　　All are old farmers who have taken off the illiteracy hat.
　　This is a folk song from the Aiguo Cooperative in Beishe Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, praising their cultural emancipation.

　　As early as 1952, illiterates and semi-literates in Beishe Village accounted for 85% of the total number of young and middle-aged people. With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, cadres and the masses deeply felt the pain of being uneducated. The first difficulties they encountered were reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, Beishe Village has now changed. After five years of eliminating illiteracy, 256 people in the village have graduated from literacy classes (accounting for 64% of the young and middle-aged illiterates), and have initially mastered the tool of literacy. More than 100 people have participated in higher primary and junior high school classes.

　　After Beishe Village basically eliminated a large number of illiterates, just as their own folk song says: the leading cadres and technicians of the cooperative are all farmers who have taken off the illiteracy hat. Among the graduates of literacy classes, 85 people have become township and cooperative cadres, and 50 people have served as accountants, health workers, technicians, and work point recorders in the cooperatives, powerfully promoting production and various rural tasks.

　　With culture, farmers have created a new social atmosphere in rural areas. The phenomenon of not working during the day and visiting door to door at night has changed, and a new fashion of learning culture is growing.

　　The Beishe People's School has persisted for five years now. Township and cooperative cadres recognize that eliminating illiteracy is one of the indispensable conditions for running the cooperative well. They strengthen specific leadership over the work of the people's school and pay attention to conducting ideological education among the masses on learning culture. Party and Youth League members in the village also participate in this study. Township and cooperative cadres form cadre classes to accelerate the elimination of illiteracy among them, driving the masses to learn.

　　In the past few years, the reason why the Beishe People's School has persisted with such vigor is mainly because it is closely integrated with production. According to the different situations of busy and slack seasons in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, the cultural learning time is specifically arranged, and the teaching forms are flexibly changed. In winter, the focus is on centralized learning. After the spring plowing begins, the learning organization and teaching methods are changed. During busy times, classes are regularly arranged for centralized deployment and inspection, turning to field review, supplemented by methods such as delivering characters to the door and group reading and writing. At the same time, according to production divisions, decentralized learning groups such as flour mills, oil mills, and feeder sideline industries were organized. The People's School implements the principle of "self-run, self-study, self-teach" and adheres to the mass line of running schools. Major and minor matters of the People's School, such as financial expenditures, voluntary teaching in exchange for work, construction of classrooms, and holiday openings, are all resolved through mass discussions.

　　Illiterate Village Transformed into Cultural Village

　　Fujia Yuan is a small village in the mountain沟 of Chousang Township, Yaoxian County, Shaanxi Province. The population is very small, and in the past, the youth and adults of the village were all illiterate.

　　In the winter of 1955, a people's school was established in the village. After one or two years of study, among the 35 young and middle-aged people, 11 have graduated from literacy classes, 13 recognize more than 1,300 characters, and 11 recognize 500 to 800 characters. Now, the village subscribes to six or seven kinds of newspapers and periodicals such as "Shaanxi Peasant Newspaper," "Youth Daily," and "Rural Propagandist." It has also established a library and two reading groups. Reading books and newspapers has become a habit of the members. Pens and notebooks, which were rare in the village in the past, have now become necessities in the lives of the members. In the past, everyone was illiterate, but now every family has someone learning culture. A remote mountain village has presented a new look. (队动辄得咎上)

　　Wang Wenbin, a 55-year-old member of the Tianjin First Shoe-Making Cooperative, pulled a rickshaw for 20 years in the old society. He actively participated in this literacy campaign, and he has learned more than 1,000 characters in the past year. He is writing carefully; to the left is the writing he did with ink.

### 扫除文盲以后

　　扫除文盲以后
　　记工管账，全由农民充当
    民校比家还要亲，
    一天不学不放心。
    五年闪眼过去了，
    瞎汉变成文化人。
    记工账，当会计，
    全是摘了文盲帽子的老农民。
    这是山西平顺县北社村爱国社社员歌颂自己文化翻身的一首歌谣。
    远在1952年，北社村的文盲半文盲占青壮年总数85％。随着互助合作运动发展，干部和群众深深感到没文化的痛苦，他们首先遇到的是读、写、算的困难。但是，现在北社村已经变了样，经过五个年头的扫除文盲，全村已经有二百五十六人扫盲毕业（占青壮年文盲的64％），初步掌握了文字工具，有一百多人参加高小班、初中班学习。
    北社村基本上扫除了大量的文盲以后，正像他们自己的那首歌谣中所说的：合作社的领导干部和技术人员全是摘了文盲帽子的农民。在扫盲毕业的学员当中，有八十五人当了乡社干部，有五十人担任了合作社的会计、保健员、技术员、记工员，有力地推动了生产和农村各项工作。
    农民有了文化，在农村形成了新的社会风气。过去那些白天不劳动，夜来串门户的现象改变了，学习文化的新风尚正在增长。
    北社民校到现在已经坚持五年之久。乡社干部认识到扫除文盲是办好合作社不可缺少的条件之一，加强对民校工作的具体领导，并且注意向群众进行学习文化的思想教育，村的党、团员也都参加这一学习，乡、社干部组成干部班，加速扫除他们中间的文盲，带动群众学习。
    几年来，北社民校所以一股劲儿坚持下来，主要是紧密结合生产，根据春、夏、秋、冬忙闲不同情况，具体的安排文化学习时间，灵活改变教学形式，冬季以集中学习为主，在春耕开始后，改变学习组织和教学方法，大忙以班定期集中布置检查，转入田间复习，辅以上门送字、小组读写等方法。同时根据生产分业，组织了粉坊、油坊、饲养员副业等分散学习小组。民校贯彻“自办、自学、自教”原则，坚持群众办学路线。民校的大小事情，如经费开支、义教还工、建设教室、放假开学等，都是经过群众的讨论得到解决的。
　  文盲村变成了文化村
    傅家塬是陕西省耀县稠桑乡山沟里的一个小村子。人口很少，过去村子的青年、壮年都是文盲。
    1955年冬季村里办起了民校，经过了一两年来的学习，三十五个青壮年当中，已有十一人扫盲毕业，十三人认识一千三百多字，十一人认识五百到八百字。现在，村里订有陕西农民报、青年报、农村宣传员等六、七种报刊，还成立了一个图书室、两个读报组，读书看报已经成为社员们的习惯。从前村里少见的笔和本子，现在已经成为社员们在生活上的必需品。从前人人不识字，现在家家有人学文化。一个偏僻山沟村庄，已呈现出一副新的面貌。（队动辄得咎上）
