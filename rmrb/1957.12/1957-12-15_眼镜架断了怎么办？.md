    What to do if your glasses frame breaks?
    The frames of glasses are generally made of a material called cellulose acetate. This substance will begin to become sticky and eventually dissolve when it comes into contact with acetone or ethyl acetate. However, if this sticky part is placed in the air, it will gradually harden as the acetone or ethyl acetate evaporates.
    Based on this property, we can apply a few drops of acetone or ethyl acetate to each of the broken surfaces, wait for them to become sticky, connect them together, and tie them with a small strip of cloth. After hardening, remove the cloth strips, and the "disabled" glasses frame can be used again.
    Acetone and ethyl acetate are available at pharmacies.

### 眼镜架断了怎么办？

    眼镜架断了怎么办？
    眼镜的框架，一般都是用一种名叫醋酸纤维的原料做成的。这种东西和丙酮或醋酸乙酯相接触后，就会开始发粘，最后溶解掉。但是若把这发粘的部分放在空气中，那么由于丙酮或醋酸乙酯的挥发，它又会逐渐地变硬起来。
    根据这种性质，我们就可以在折断的两截面上，分别滴上数滴丙酮或醋酸乙酯，等它发粘后，把它们连接起来，并用小布条扎好。硬化后，解去布条，这“残废”的眼镜架就可重新再用了。
    丙酮和醋酸乙酯药房有卖的。
