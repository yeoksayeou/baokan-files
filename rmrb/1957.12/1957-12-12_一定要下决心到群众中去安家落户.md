　　We Must Be Determined to Settle Down Among the Masses
　　Huang Oudong, First Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

The anti-rightist struggle in the literary circles of Liaoning Province has achieved a great victory. The achievements are tremendous, and the lessons learned are profound. Through this struggle, many writers and young authors have deeply realized that: to completely defeat bourgeois literary thought, implement the Party's literary line, and establish a working-class literary team, the main key lies in the combination of writers and the worker-peasant-soldier masses. Therefore, we must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instruction, which was clearly put forward at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art: Literary and art workers "must go to the worker-peasant-soldier masses for a long period of time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly." The main task in the rectification and reform stage of the literary and art circles is to transform Chairman Mao's instruction into the specific practice of writers.

Currently, some of the writers and young authors in the Liaoning area have already participated in labor production and grassroots work, and the vast majority of people are determined to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and are considering and planning to go to the worker-peasant-soldier masses. The Shenyang Branch of the Chinese Writers Association has decided to change the way resident writers work. The existing resident writers, the younger ones who joined the revolution after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, will all participate in physical labor. For example, Sun Yu, the author of "Women's Representative," and Yang Shuhui, the author of "Huanghualing," have decided to move their homes to the countryside, settle down in the countryside, and directly participate in labor production. The slightly older ones who joined the revolution during and before the Anti-Japanese War have undergone a longer period of revolutionary training, and most of them directly participated in labor production in Yan'an. They will also go down to participate in grassroots work for a long time. For example, Ma Jia has decided to live in a factory for a short period of time first, and then move to the countryside to live for a long time. Shi Tianshou has decided to go to the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory to live. Cai Tianxin will go to the countryside to live and work for a long time after completing his new work. Xie Tingyu has gone to the Fuxin Xinqiu Coal Mine to take on some practical work. However, although some comrades have expressed their willingness to go down, they have not yet made up their minds to settle down among the masses for a long time, and they are still hesitating and struggling internally. Although some comrades are enthusiastic, they do not yet deeply understand the great significance of going down. They do not understand that this time going to the masses is fundamentally different from the past when writers went to the masses to "experience" life.

In the past few years, many writers and young writers in the Liaoning area have also paid attention to the issue of going to the masses. However, this anti-rightist struggle shows that the situation of literary workers in the Liaoning area being divorced from the masses is still very serious. What is the reason for this? This is because, in the past, many people went to the masses only as third parties to experience the lives of the masses for a short period of time, simply to find materials for creation. Therefore, they often only contacted the lives of the masses in a "cursory" and "superficial" way, and could not truly and honestly delve into the lives of the masses. Some comrades, although nominally held positions in grassroots units for a relatively long time, in fact rarely did practical work, and they mistakenly believed that participating in practical work would affect observing life and creative conception. Thus, they could only be guests of grassroots units, and could not truly become one of them. Such going to the masses cannot only not completely transform one's own thinking, but also cannot truly become familiar with and understand the lives of the masses. Facts have proved that this path is not feasible.

Writers and literary workers should go to the masses for a long period of time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly to settle down, and also make themselves a participant and organizer of labor production.

Why must writers go to the masses for a long time? And also make themselves a participant and organizer of labor production? Because literary works are the product of the reflection of a certain social life in the minds of writers. To write excellent socialist literary works, writers must truly be familiar with the lives and struggles of the worker-peasant-soldier masses who are the main body of socialist construction, and must have the standpoint, thoughts, and feelings of the working class that are closely connected with the masses. And in order to achieve these two goals, it is necessary to go to the masses for a long period of time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly.

The main and primary purpose of going to the masses should be to thoroughly transform oneself. Judging from the situation exposed in this anti-rightist struggle: because many writers and young authors have not yet undergone fundamental transformation, and because of the objective conditions of individual labor methods and the ability to obtain personal fame and gain, it is easy for writers to be corrupted by bourgeois individualism, coupled with the influence of bourgeois rightists and other bad elements, the unhealthy ideological situation of our literary team is quite serious. This has made many young authors who grew up in the new society and a few people with a relatively long period of revolutionary experience, regrettably degenerate into rightists. This situation cannot continue. And the only way is for writers and young authors to make up their minds to go to the masses, to the flames of mass struggle to temper themselves and transform themselves. Writers and young authors must understand that the problem now facing many literary workers is first of all whether or not to thoroughly transform themselves, become a working-class intellectual, and become a writer who wholeheartedly serves socialism. Since the problem is placed so sharply in front of literary workers, this determines that writers must be determined to settle down among the masses, share weal and woe with the masses, and become a member of the masses. Do not just be a guest, be a bystander. This is the correct path that resolute, thoroughly reformed, and promising writers must take.

It takes a lot of determination for writers and young authors to go to the masses for a long time to settle down, and it takes a fierce ideological struggle. It is easy for some intellectuals to admit verbally that labor creates social wealth, and not to despise physical labor and the laboring masses. But it is much more difficult to completely change the bourgeois view of the working people. This view often stubbornly emerges in various forms and under various pretexts. For example, some literary workers are only willing to go to the masses for a short period of time. They can make up their minds to endure some "hardship" in the short term, and can "lower" their status as writers in the short term, but they cannot make up their minds to "go to the worker-peasant-soldier masses for a long period of time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly." Because they believe that the status of writers is much "nobler" than that of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is obviously a concrete manifestation of not wanting to truly transform oneself.

Therefore, whether writers and young authors can make up their minds to "go to the masses for a long period of time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly" is actually a test of their outlook on life. Those who are determined to thoroughly transform themselves into working-class intellectuals must make this determination. And the more one cannot make this determination, the more one needs to make this determination. Making this determination is a sign that one is willing to abandon the non-proletarian outlook on life, which means that one has taken a big step forward in the process of transforming oneself.

Socialist literature can only develop solidly and vigorously on this basis, that is, when writers and literary workers are deeply rooted in the worker-peasant-soldier masses. The Party's organization of writers this time to "go to the masses for a long period of time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly" will undoubtedly bring new prosperity to our literary creation with the further transformation of the thinking of writers and young literary workers. All writers and young literary workers who are loyal to the cause of socialist literature should work tirelessly to create works of high level for the people!

### 一定要下决心到群众中去安家落户

　　一定要下决心到群众中去安家落户
　　中共辽宁省委第一书记　黄欧东
    辽宁省文学界反右派斗争已经获得很大胜利。成绩是巨大的，经验教训也是深刻的。经过这次斗争，许多作家和青年作者都深切地认识到：要彻底战胜资产阶级文艺思想，贯彻党的文艺路线，建立工人阶级的文学队伍，主要的关键在于作家和工农兵群众的结合。所以必须坚决贯彻执行毛主席早在延安文艺座谈会上就已明确提出的：文艺家“必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去”。文艺界在整风的整改阶段中的主要任务，就是要使毛主席这一指示变为作家的具体实践。
    现在辽宁地区的作家和青年作者，有一部分已经参加了劳动生产和基层工作，绝大多数的人都下决心响应党中央的号召，正在考虑和计划到工农兵群众中去。中国作家协会沈阳分会已经决定改变驻会作家的方式。现有的驻会作家们，年纪较轻的都是抗日战争胜利后参加革命工作的，他们都将去参加体力劳动。如“妇女代表”的作者孙芋和“黄花岭”的作者杨淑慧，已经决定把家搬到农村中去，在农村中安家落户，直接参加劳动生产。年纪稍长的都是在抗日战争时期和抗日战争以前参加革命的，曾经受过较长时期的革命锻炼，大部分在延安都曾直接参加过劳动生产，他们也将下去长期参加基层工作。如马加已决定先到工厂生活一个短时期后，就搬到农村长期生活。师田手已决定去沈阳第一机械厂生活。蔡天心完成了新作品后，即到农村长期生活和工作。谢挺宇已经到阜新新丘煤矿担任部分实际工作。但是，有些同志虽然表示愿意下去，还下不了长期到群众中去安家落户的决心，内心还在犹豫，还有斗争。有些同志热情虽然高，但对于下去的重大意义却还了解不深。他们还不了解，这次到群众中去，同过去作家到群众中去“体验”生活，根本不同。
    过去几年来，辽宁地区的许多作家和青年写作者也曾注意了到群众中去的问题。然而，这次反右派斗争却表明：辽宁地区文学工作者脱离群众的情况仍然十分严重。这是什么原因呢？这是因为，过去许多人到群众中去，只是以第三者的身份短时期去体验一下群众的生活，单纯地去寻找创作的材料。因此，就往往只是“走马看花”，“蜻蜓点水”地接触群众生活，而不能真正老老实实地深入群众生活。有的同志虽然名义上是较长期地担任了基层单位的职务，但事实上却很少做实际工作，他们错误地以为参加了实际工作就会影响观察生活和创作构思。于是就只能做基层单位的客人，而不能真正成为他们中间的一个。这样的到群众中去，不仅不能彻底改造自己的思想，而且也不能真正熟悉和了解群众的生活。事实证明，这条路是走不通的。
    作家、文学工作者应长期地无条件地全心全意地到群众中去安家落户，并且使自己也变成一个劳动生产的参加者和组织者。
    为什么作家必须要长期到群众中去？并且使自己也变成一个劳动生产的参加者和组织者呢？因为，文学作品乃是一定社会生活在作家头脑中反映的产物。作家要写出优秀的社会主义文学作品，就必须真正熟悉作为社会主义建设者主体的工农兵群众的生活和斗争，就必须具有工人阶级的立场、思想和与群众息息相通的感情。而为了达到这两方面的目的，都非要长期地、无条件地、全心全意地到群众中去不可。
    到群众中去的主要的、第一位的目的应当是去彻底改造自己。从这次反右派斗争暴露的情况看来：由于作家和青年作者中有许多人还没经过根本改造，由于个体劳动方式和能够获得个人名利的客观条件，容易使作家受资产阶级个人主义思想腐蚀，再加上资产阶级右派分子和其他坏分子的影响，我们文学队伍思想不健康的情况是相当严重的。这就使得不少在新社会中长大起来的青年作者和少数具有相当长时期革命资历的人，令人痛心地堕落为右派分子。这种状况不能再继续下去了。而唯一的道路就是作家和青年作者们要痛下决心，到群众中去，到群众斗争的烈火中去锻炼自己、改造自己。作家和青年作者必须了解，现在摆在许多文学工作者面前的问题，首先是要不要彻底改造自己、做个工人阶级的知识分子，做个全心全意为社会主义服务的作家的问题。问题既然这样尖锐地摆在文学工作者的面前，这就决定了作家必须下决心到群众中去安家落户、与群众同甘苦、共命运，成为群众的一分子。而不要仅仅去做客人，去做旁观者。这是有决心彻底改造自己的、有出息的作家所必须走的正确道路。
    作家和青年作者长期到群众中去安家落户，是要下很大决心，要经过一番剧烈的思想斗争的。有些知识分子在口头上承认劳动创造社会财富，在口头上不轻视体力劳动和劳动群众是容易的。但真正彻底改变资产阶级对于劳动人民的观点，却困难得多。这种观点经常会在种种形式、种种借口下，顽强地涌现出来。例如，有些文学工作者只肯短期到群众中去，他们可以下决心短期下去吃些“苦”，可以短期“降低”自己作家的地位，但他们却下不了“长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中”的决心。因为他们认为：作家的地位是比工农兵“高贵”得多的。这显然是不想真正改造自己的具体表现。
    所以，作家和青年作者能否下决心“长期地无条件地全心全意地到群众中去”，这实际上是对自己人生观的一次考验。有志于将自己彻底改造成为工人阶级知识分子的人，非要痛下这个决心不可。而愈是下不了这个决心的人，就愈需要下这个决心。下了这个决心，就是自己肯于决心抛弃非无产阶级的人生观的标志，这就意味着在改造自己的过程中，又前进了一大步。
    社会主义文学是只有在这样的基础上，即作家和文学工作者们都深深地扎根于工农兵群众中间，才能坚实和蓬勃地发展起来。党这次组织作家们“长期地无条件地全心全意地到群众中去”，无疑将随着作家和青年文学工作者思想的进一步的改造，带来我们文学创作上新的繁荣。一切忠实于社会主义文学事业的作家和青年文学工作者，都应该持久不懈地为给人民创作出具有高度水平的作品而努力！
