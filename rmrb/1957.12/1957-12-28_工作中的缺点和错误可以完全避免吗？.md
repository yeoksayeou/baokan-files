    Can Shortcomings and Mistakes in Work Be Completely Avoided?
    Chen Yuanfang
    In work, some shortcomings and mistakes can be avoided, while others cannot.
    People ask us to avoid swaying from left to right and to be absolutely correct and infallible in our work and in mastering policies. This motive is as good as it gets. However, the development of objective things does not shift according to people's will. When you do not yet understand the laws of the development of things, there will always be some large and small sways and mistakes. This phenomenon can be said to be unavoidable.
    Why? Because understanding also has its own laws of development. Understanding itself is a dialectical process of development from ignorance to knowledge, from superficiality to depth, and from error to correctness. Whether an understanding is correct cannot be determined without a certain amount of time and verification in reality. Things cannot be recognized until they are exposed to a certain extent.
    In recent years, our understanding of the apprenticeship system, private schooling, the problem of employee dormitories, the method of raising livestock in agricultural cooperatives, and so on, has all followed this process.
    Regarding the apprenticeship system, at first, we only recognized many unreasonable aspects of the old apprenticeship system: feudal bad habits, oppression and exploitation of apprentices, and antagonistic master-apprentice relationships. Was this understanding correct? Yes, it was based on long-term practical experience in the old society. We reformed the apprenticeship system, established technical schools and training classes, etc., overcoming the original shortcomings of the apprenticeship system. However, new problems arose: apprentices were promoted too quickly, received excessive treatment, did not learn real skills and were arrogant and conceited, looked down on older workers, and the relationship between new and old workers was abnormal. Therefore, the Party proposed a new apprenticeship system. Should the new apprenticeship system be proposed? Yes. It is based on the practical experience of recent years. It can be said that our understanding of the apprenticeship system now is much deeper than before.
    The same is true for private schooling. In the early days of the liberation of Xi'an, there were many private middle and primary schools where students paid to attend and teachers taught to make a living. Later, due to the emphasis on standardization, the idea of being taken over by the state emerged. At that time, there were also opposing opinions, believing that except for a few that must be taken over, most could be strengthened through management and did not need to be taken over; if the state had the strength, why not establish more schools to expand enrollment. However, this opinion did not attract the attention of relevant departments. In the past two years, students have had problems with schooling and enrollment, and it has become necessary to encourage private individuals and groups to establish and run schools to supplement the state's strength. Now, our understanding of this issue is also much deeper than before.
    Let's talk about the method of raising livestock. During the period of individual agricultural management, livestock were raised separately. Separate feeding has disadvantages such as wasting labor. Therefore, after collectivization, with the centralized use of land, farmers also concentrated their livestock and implemented centralized feeding. After a year of practice in 1956, it was found that this feeding method also had problems: livestock varied in size and strength, and ate grass at different speeds, resulting in some being full and some not, mutual disturbance, poor rest, and easy transmission of diseases; thus causing a large number of abnormal deaths. After the Central Committee discovered this problem, it instructed various localities to widely promote the method of separate feeding of livestock, and the phenomenon of abnormal death and weakness of livestock began to reverse. Now, our understanding of raising livestock is also much deeper than before.
    The "Five-Anti" movement was also like this. I remember that when we first fought back against the bourgeoisie's wild attacks, some areas launched an all-out attack, with a broad scope of attack. Later, the bourgeoisie was divided into five categories: serious lawbreakers, lawbreakers, semi-lawbreakers/semi-abiding citizens, basically law-abiding citizens, and law-abiding citizens. Our understanding of the internal situation of the bourgeoisie became much deeper. After the proposal of such specific analysis and differentiated treatment policies, the bourgeoisie was quickly divided and isolated, and the victory of the "Five-Anti" struggle was achieved.
    Changes in mastering and implementing policies like these are, of course, considered shortcomings and mistakes in specific work; but in terms of the process of understanding, this is unavoidable.
    If you don't do some foolish things, you won't do smart things; if you don't take some detours, you won't find the right path; if you don't go through repeated practice, you won't be able to form a more comprehensive and correct understanding. Advancing forward with twists and turns, that's how the process of understanding goes. It is impossible to simplify it.
    We must also understand that so-called understanding is a developmental process. This refers not only to a leader or a leading body, but also to the understanding of the masses of the people. A problem, a policy viewpoint, may be understood by the leaders and leading bodies, but not necessarily by the masses and lower-level organizations; what A thinks is correct, B may think is wrong. Therefore, it is not easy to implement a correct policy or completely correct a deviation. On the one hand, we must carry out arduous political and organizational work; on the other hand, we must also give the masses the opportunity to understand, allowing them to recognize the correctness of the Party's policies based on their own personal experience. Here, coercive methods and the practice of "the people can be made to follow it, but cannot be made to understand it" are not feasible.
    Comrade Mao Zedong made a classic generalization of this phenomenon in "On Practice," proposing a famous formula: practice - understanding - re-practice - re-understanding. After discussing the reflection of the objective process in the movement of understanding and the role of human subjective initiative, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out:
    "Generally speaking, whether in the practice of changing nature or changing society, it is rare for people's original ideas, theories, plans, and programs to be realized without any changes. This is because people engaged in changing reality are often subject to many restrictions, not only scientific and technological conditions, but also the development of the objective process and the degree of its manifestation (the aspects and essence of the objective process have not been fully exposed). In this situation, it is common to partially change ideas, theories, plans, and programs due to the discovery of unforeseen circumstances in practice, and it is also possible to change them entirely. That is to say, it is possible for the original ideas, theories, plans, and programs to be partially or completely inconsistent with reality, partially wrong or completely wrong. Many times, it is necessary to fail repeatedly before correcting erroneous understandings, reaching conformity with the laws of the objective process, and thus being able to transform subjective things into objective things, that is, achieving the expected results in practice."
    Lenin also pointed out:
    "Those who want to solve the more difficult task of defeating capitalism should also have the perseverance to try hundreds or even thousands of new methods, ways, and means of struggle until they arrive at the most appropriate method." ("Complete Works of Lenin," Volume 29, p. 387)
    That is to say, correct policies, guidelines, ways, and methods must be found through practice and experimentation. Once found, after a while, the situation develops, and the things found become outdated and unsuitable, and it is necessary to find newer and more suitable things. Thus, again and again, so that policies are constantly supplemented, corrected, and perfected in revolutionary practice.
    Lenin also pointed out for us:
    "We admit that we should make up for what we have not done, but does this mean admitting that we made some mistake before? Absolutely not. Let's take war as an analogy again. If it is possible to defeat and push back the enemy with light cavalry alone, then we should do so. But if this action can only achieve results to a certain extent, then beyond this extent, heavy artillery must naturally be brought in. We admit that we should now make up for the fact that we did not bring in heavy artillery before, but this is absolutely not admitting that the victorious attack of the light cavalry was a mistake." ("Selected Works of Lenin," Volume 2, Moscow 1950 Chinese edition, p. 378)
    That is to say, what was done before and what was not done before but is now being made up for are both correct in two different situations, and it cannot be considered that one is correct and the other is wrong. "Past experience, if not forgotten, is a guide for the future." The future is precisely the development and supplement of the past, and there is not no relationship between them.
    Does this mean it has become an "unavoidable theory?" We are not utopian thinkers; we are practical workers, and we must admit that some shortcomings and mistakes in work are indeed difficult to avoid.
    Wouldn't it be better to have a revolution and not make any shortcomings and mistakes? Unfortunately, it is not practically possible. To say that it is possible is just a fantasy of people without any practical work experience. Revolution is the great action of millions of people, not embroidery. It cannot be required that not a single stitch be wrong. If you want not a single stitch to be wrong, unless you don't want a mass revolutionary movement. During the Great Revolution of 1927, when the masses rose up, the Kuomintang right-wing elements shouted "terrible," and the opportunist leadership of our Party, headed by Chen Duxiu, also shouted "terrible," so they restricted the mass movement in every possible way, not allowing the mass movement to have a little mistake. As a result, they made a big mistake and ruined the Great Revolution. Now, the bourgeois right-wing elements have given us such a question: the Five Great Movements and the Three Great Transformations can be carried out, but no mistakes are allowed. Are they really concerned about the shortcomings and mistakes in our work and helping us to correct them? Are they really concerned about the healthy development of the Five Great Movements and the Three Great Transformations? No. Their real purpose is to hope that our shortcomings and mistakes are as many as possible, fearing that we will not make mistakes, fearing that the world will not be in chaos. Their real purpose is not to have the Five Great Movements and the Three Great Transformations at all. It can be said with certainty that if we follow the right-wing plan, we will ruin today's socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    We admit that some shortcomings and mistakes are inevitable in our work, but it does not mean that shortcomings and mistakes are legitimate in our ranks, are allowed, can be ignored when they are found, and allowed to develop. We admit that we have some shortcomings and mistakes in order to better overcome these shortcomings and mistakes. How can a party that dares not face its own shortcomings and mistakes be expected to effectively overcome these shortcomings and mistakes? The fact is also true. Every correct policy of our Party is implemented in the struggle against mistakes. In order to prevent some mistakes that may occur in our work, the Party has taken many measures and made great efforts, which is understood by those who are familiar with the Party's political and organizational life.
    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People":
    "We still lack experience in economic construction, because it has only been going on for seven years and we still need to accumulate experience. We also had no experience in revolution at the beginning, we stumbled, gained experience, and then we had national victory. We demand that the time for gaining experience in economic construction be shorter than the time for gaining revolutionary experience, and at the same time, we should not pay such a high price."
    This is Comrade Mao Zedong's extremely earnest teaching to the whole Party, with heartfelt words and profound reflection.
    Our task is not to accuse why we have no experience, but to pay attention to summarizing experience, accumulating experience, and shortening the time to gain experience as much as possible; not to shy away from shortcomings and mistakes, or to talk endlessly about shortcomings and mistakes, or to be panic-stricken in the face of shortcomings and mistakes, but to discover and resolutely correct these shortcomings and mistakes in a timely manner, so that work can be continuously transferred from the wrong side to the correct side, turning bad things into good things and pushing our cause forward.
    Then, are there any "left" and right-leaning phenomena in the implementation of policies? Yes. Real right-leaning is: the situation has long developed and changed, but it is not seen, and it is still the old way, making us deviate from reality and the majority of the masses in policy guidance for a long time or a relatively long time. This is a conservative and backward thought. Real "left"-leaning is: the situation has not changed much, the time is not yet ripe, and the conditions are not very adequate, but one acts cleverly and shouts that the situation has changed greatly, and wants to move recklessly. This is a blind and adventurous thought. As for timely proposing new policies and measures according to the development and changes of the situation, so that the current policies are suitable for the current situation, this cannot be called "left"-leaning or right-leaning. For example, the aforementioned proposal of new policies and measures of the Central Committee on the apprenticeship system, employee dormitories, etc., belongs to this category. It is wrong to think that this is "left"-leaning or right-leaning, "anti-right must be left, anti-left must be right," is "walking on one leg."
    However, the understanding of some people in our Party is the opposite. They metaphysically only see the changes in policies such as mobilizing employees' families to return to their hometowns, sending cadres down, students participating in labor, and the new apprenticeship system, but do not understand the essence of such policies; they only complain that the higher authorities should not do this and should not do that in mastering policies, but never say how they should do it; they verbally oppose "left"-leaning or right-leaning, but actually deny the correctness of the Party's current policies. Ideologically conservative, following the old ways, very passive in the face of new things, at a loss, endless complaints and grumbles, and even echoing, making random comments, and speaking for the rightists, this is their performance.
    We say that some shortcomings and mistakes are unavoidable in mastering policies, but it does not mean that all shortcomings and mistakes are unavoidable. Some shortcomings and mistakes can be avoided. It is also wrong to deny this.
    For example, before starting a certain task or formulating a certain policy, through diligent investigation and research, careful planning, and continuous summarizing of experience, so that one's understanding of objective reality is deepened, at this time, it is possible to increase the predictability of work (of course, this predictability is still limited), reduce blindness, and make the problem get a more correct solution. Why do we oppose bureaucracy and a rough and careless work style? It is because some shortcomings and mistakes could have been avoided through subjective efforts, but they were not avoided. For example, after making a mistake once, having experience and lessons, "the overturned cart in front is a warning to the cart behind," the same mistake can be avoided again. Why can't we tolerate mistakes being made again and again? It is because people who make such mistakes are careless, repeatedly fail to learn, and consistently ignore experience and lessons, so that completely avoidable mistakes are not avoided.
    It is impossible to ask a leader, even a genius leader, to not make any shortcomings and mistakes in work, but strengthening political responsibility, going deep into practice, connecting with the masses, studying hard, paying attention to experience and lessons, and preventing some avoidable shortcomings and mistakes are what general leaders should and can do. It is precisely because of this that our Party has been able to discover and correct some shortcomings and mistakes in its work in a timely manner, so that these shortcomings and mistakes have not developed to a serious point, and has always maintained the Party's correct leadership over all aspects of work.

    工作中的缺点和错误可以完全避免吗？
    陈元方
    在工作中，有些缺点和错误是可以避免的，有些则是不能避免的。
    人们要求我们在工作中，在掌握政策中，不发生左右摇摆现象，绝对正确，万无一失。这种动机，可说是再好没有了。但是，客观事物的发展，是不以人的意志为转移的，当你还不认识事物发展的规律时，总要发生一些大大小小的摇摆和错误。这种现象，可以说是难免的。
    为什么？因为认识也有它自己的发展规律，认识本身就是从无知到知、从肤浅到深刻、从错误到正确的一个辩证发展过程。认识是否正确，不经过一定的时间和现实的验证，就无法判定。事物不暴露到一定程度，总是不能被认识的。
    这几年来，我们对学徒制的认识，对私人办学的认识，对职工宿舍问题的认识，对农业合作社中牲口喂养方法的认识，等等问题的认识，过程都是如此。
    关于学徒制，一开始，我们只认识到旧学徒制的许多不合理方面：封建陋规、对学徒的压迫剥削、师徒关系对立等。这个认识对不对？对的，它是以旧社会长时期的实践经验为基础的。我们对学徒制进行改革，开办技工学校和训练班等等，克服了学徒制原有的缺点。但是，新的问题又发生了：学徒升级太快，待遇过高，真本事学得不多而又骄傲自大，轻视老年工人，新老工人关系不正常等。因而，党又提出了新的学徒制。新学徒制应该不应该提出？应该。它是以这几年的实践经验为基础的。可以说，现在我们对于学徒制的认识，就比以往深刻得多了。
    关于私人办学也是如此。西安解放初期，私立中学小学不少，学生掏钱上学，教师教学谋生。后来由于强调正规，产生由国家包下来的思想。当时也有反面的意见，认为除一部分必须接办者外，一般可以加强管理，不必接办；如果国家有力量，何不增办一些学校以扩大就学人数。但是，这种意见没有引起有关方面的注意。近两年来，学生们上学升学发生了问题，又不得不提出鼓励私人和团体单位办学兴学，以补充国家力量之不足。现在，我们对于这个问题的认识，也比以前深刻得多了。
    再说喂养牲口的方法。在个体农业经营时期，牲口都是分散喂养的。分散喂养，有浪费劳动力等缺点，所以，合作化后，随着土地的集中使用，农民把牲口也集中起来，实行集中喂养。经过1956年一年的实践，发现这种喂养方法也有问题：牲口大小强弱不同，吃草快慢不同，结果有的吃得饱，有的吃不饱，互相惊扰，休息不好，又易传染疾病；因而造成大量非正常死亡的现象。中央发现这个问题后，就指示各地普遍推广分散喂养牲口的办法，牲口非正常死亡和瘦弱的现象，才开始扭转。现在，我们对于喂养牲口的认识，也比过去深刻得多了。
    “五反”运动也是如此。记得开始打退资产阶级猖狂进攻时，某些地区全面出击，打击面大，后来把资产阶级分为严重违法户、违法户、半违法半守法户、基本守法户和守法户五种，我们对资产阶级内部情况的认识，就深刻得多了。这样的具体分析和分别对待的政策提出后，很快地就分化并孤立了资产阶级，取得了“五反”斗争的胜利。
    像这些掌握和执行政策中的变化，就具体工作说，当然算是缺点和错误；但就认识过程说，这是难免的。
    不干出一些傻事笨事，就不会干出聪明事来；不走一些冤枉路，就探索不到正路；不经过多次的反复的实践，就无法形成比较全面的正确的认识。曲曲折折向前进，认识的过程就是如此。要想把它简单化是不可能的。
    我们还要明白，所谓认识是一个发展过程。这不仅是指一个领导人，一个领导机关而言，而且包括人民群众的认识在内。一个问题，一个政策观点，领导人、领导机关在思想上通了，群众和下级机关不一定通；甲认为是正确的，也许正好乙认为是错误的。所以，一个正确的政策要贯彻下去，一个偏差要彻底纠正过来，都不是容易的事。一方面，我们要进行艰苦的政治工作与组织工作；另方面，也要给群众以认识的机会，让群众根据自己的切身经验来认识党的政策的正确性。在这里，强迫命令的作法，“民可使由之，不可使知之”的作法，是行不通的。
    毛泽东同志在“实践论”中把这种现象作了经典性的概括，提出了一个著名的公式：实践——认识——再实践——再认识。毛泽东同志在讲了认识运动中客观过程的反映和人的主观能动性的作用之后指出：
    “一般地说来，不论在变革自然或变革社会的实践中，人们原定的思想、理论、计划、方案，毫无改变地实现出来的事，是很少的。这是因为从事变革现实的人们，常常受着许多的限制，不但常常受着科学条件和技术条件的限制，而且也受着客观过程的发展及其表现程度的限制（客观过程的方面及本质尚未充分暴露）。在这种情形之下，由于实践中发现前所未料的情况，因而部分地改变思想、理论、计划、方案的事是常有的，全部地改变的事也是有的。即是说，原定的思想、理论、计划、方案，部分地或全部地不合于实际，部分错了或全部错了的事，都是有的。许多时候须反复失败过多次，才能纠正错误的认识，才能到达于和客观过程的规律性相符合，因而才能够变主观的东西为客观的东西，即在实践中得到预想的结果。”
    列宁也曾指出：
    “要想解决战胜资本主义这一更困难的任务的人们，也应该具有坚韧不拔的精神来试验几百以至几千种新的斗争方法、方式和手段，直到得出最适当的办法为止。”（“列宁全集”，第29卷，第387页）
    这就是说，正确的政策、方针、方式、方法，必须经过实践、试验才能找到，找到了，过些时候情况发展，找到的东西就变成陈旧、不适用了，又必须另找更新的更适合的东西。如此，一次一次地下去，使政策在革命实践中不断地得到补充、校正和日益完善。
    列宁还为我们指出：
    “我们承认应该弥补没有做到的事情，但这是否就等于承认以前犯了某种错误呢？绝对不是的。我们再拿战争作比喻吧。如果能够单用轻骑队击溃并压退敌人，那就应该这样干去。但如果这个动作只能在相当限度内获得战果，那末，在这个限度以外，自然要调来重炮队。我们承认现在应弥补以前没有作的调来重炮一事，这绝对不是承认轻骑队底胜利攻击是一个错误”。（“列宁文选”，第2卷，莫斯科1950年中文版，第378页）
    这就是说，以前做的事情和以前未做而现在补做的事情，在前后两种不同的情况下，都是正确的，不能认为一个是正确的，一个是错误的。“前事不忘，后事之师”。后事正是前事的发展、补充，它们之间并不是没有关系的。
    如此说来，不是成了“难免论”吗？我们不是空想家，我们是实际的工作者，我们就得承认在工作中有一些缺点和错误，确实是难以避免的。
    既革命，又不犯缺点和错误，岂不更好？可惜，实际上作不到。说能够作到，这只是毫无实际工作经验的人的幻想。革命是千百万人民群众的伟大行动，不是绣花，不能要求一针一线也不错乱，要一针一线也不错乱，除非不要群众革命运动。1927年大革命时期，群众起来了，国民党右派分子，大叫“糟得很”，当时我党以陈独秀为首的机会主义的领导，也叫“糟得很”，于是多方限制群众运动，不让群众运动有一点小差错，结果犯了一个大错误，断送了大革命。现在资产阶级右派分子又给我们出了这么一个题目：五大运动、三大改造可以搞，但不许有半点差错。他们是真的关心我们工作中的缺点错误，并帮助我们改正吗？是真的关心五大运动、三大改造的健康发展吗？不是的。他们的真正目的是希望我们的缺点错误愈多愈好，唯恐我们不犯错误，唯恐天下不乱。他们的真正目的是根本不要五大运动、三大改造。可以肯定地说，按着右派的方案办去，非把今天的社会主义革命和社会主义建设断送不可。
    我们承认在我们的工作中难免产生一些缺点和错误，绝不是说，缺点和错误在我们的队伍中是合法的，是被允许的，可以见错不纠，任其发展。我们承认我们有一些缺点和错误，是为了更好地来克服这些缺点和错误。一个不敢正视自己缺点和错误的党，怎能指望它有效地去克服这些缺点和错误呢？事实也正是如此，我们党的每一项正确政策，都是在和错误作斗争中贯彻下去的。党为了防止我们在工作中可能发生的一些错误，曾采取了很多措施，做了极大的努力，这是熟悉我们党的政治生活和组织生活的人都了解的。
    毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中指出：
    “经济建设我们还缺乏经验，因为才进行七年，还需要积累经验。对于革命我们开始也没有经验，翻过斤斗，取得了经验，然后才有全国的胜利。我们要求在取得经济建设方面的经验，比较取得革命经验的时间要缩短一些，同时不要花费那么高的代价。”
    这是毛泽东同志对全党的极其恳切的教导，语重心长，发人深省。
    我们的任务，不在于指斥为什么没有经验，而在于注意总结经验，积累经验，尽可能缩短取得经验的时间；不在于讳言缺点和错误，或喋喋不休地空谈缺点和错误，或在缺点和错误面前惊惶失措，而在于及时地发现和坚决地纠正这些缺点和错误，让工作不断地从错误的方面转移到正确的方面来，把坏事变成好事，把我们的事业推向前进。
    那末，在执行政策中，到底有没有“左”、右倾现象呢？有的。真正的右倾是：情况早就发展变化了，但是看不见，仍然老一套，使得我们在政策指导上长期或较长期地脱离实际，脱离大多数群众。这是一种保守落后的思想。真正的“左”倾是：情况并没有多大的变化，时机尚未成熟，条件很不具备，便自作聪明，叫喊情况大变了，毛手毛脚地要动。这是一种盲目冒险的思想。至于根据情况的发展变化，及时地提出新的政策措施，使当前的政策适合于当前的情况，这不能叫做“左”倾或右倾。例如前边提到的中央关于学徒制、职工宿舍等等新的政策措施的提出，就是属于这一类的。如果把这认为是“左”倾或右倾，是“反右必左，反左必右”，是“一条腿走路”，那是错误的。
    但是，我们党内有一些人的认识则与此相反。他们形而上学地只看到了动员职工家属回乡、干部下放、学生参加劳动、新的学徒制等政策上的变化，而并不懂得这种政策的实质；他们只是抱怨上级在掌握政策中，不该这样，不该那样，却从不说出究竟应该怎样；他们口头上是反对“左”倾或是右倾，实际上是否定党的当前政策的正确性。思想守旧，因循苟且，在新事物面前十分被动，一筹莫展，无穷的抱怨和牢骚，甚至随声附和，乱发议论，为右派张目，这就是他们的表现。
    我们说，在掌握政策中，有一些缺点和错误是无法避免的，但不是说所有缺点错误都是不可避免的。有一些缺点错误是可以避免的。否认这一点也是不对的。
    例如，在开始某一项工作或制定某一项政策以前，经过勤勤恳恳地调查研究，周密地规划，不断地总结经验，使自己对于客观现实的认识深刻化，这时候，就可以增加工作中的预见性（当然，这种预见性仍是有限度的），减少盲目性，使问题得到比较正确的解决。我们为什么反对官僚主义和粗枝大叶的工作作风呢？就是因为有些缺点和错误，经过主观努力本来是可以避免的，而他却没有避免。又例如，犯了一次错误，有了经验教训，“前车复、后车戒”，同样的错误，就可以不再犯了。我们为什么不能容忍一犯再犯的错误呢？就是因为犯有这种错误的人，漫不经心，屡教不改，一贯忽视经验教训，以致完全可以避免的错误也没有避免。
    要求一个领导者，即使是天才的领导者，在工作中一点缺点和错误不犯，是不可能的，但是，加强政治责任心，深入实践，联系群众，刻苦钻研，重视经验教训，防止一些可以避免的缺点和错误，则是一般领导者都应该做到也能够做到的。我们党，正是由于这样，才使自己能够及时地发现和纠正工作中的一些缺点和错误，使这些缺点和错误都没有发展到严重的地步，始终保持着党对各方面工作的正确领导。
