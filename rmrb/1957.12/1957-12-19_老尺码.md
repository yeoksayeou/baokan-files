    The Old Yardstick
    When Zhao Dasao is mentioned, all the neighbors give her a thumbs up. She really is "scissors on the kang, knife on the ground." She works quickly and well. The clothes she makes are both suitable and fitting. She dares to handle any material, whether it is wool or soft satin. However, she has an old yardstick: seven feet of cloth for trousers, eight feet for a jacket, preparing one zhang and five chi of material. Whoever asks her, she is always willing to help.

    A few days ago, she visited the exhibition on saving cloth and learned new tailoring methods, which really save cloth and do not waste materials. She said, "My old yardstick is outdated." Her new yardstick is: one zhang and seven chi of cloth, two pairs of trousers and one jacket. Whoever comes to her, she is still willing to help. (Shenyang Yu Bingshou)

    老尺码
    提起赵大嫂，街坊邻居都竖大拇手指头，真是“炕上一把剪子，地上一把刀”，她做活计又快又好，做的衣服，样子又合适又贴身，毛料软缎她都敢下手。但，她有个老尺码：七尺裤子八尺袄，准备一丈五尺材料，谁求她都是有求必应。
    前几天，她参观了节约用布展览会回来，学来了新式裁剪法，真是既省布又不糟踏材料。她说：“我的老尺码落后了”。她的新尺码是：一丈七尺布，两条裤子一个袄，谁来求她，还是有求必应。　（沈阳　余秉绶）
