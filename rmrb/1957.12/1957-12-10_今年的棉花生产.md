    Cotton Production This Year

    The total cotton output this year is 32.8 million dan (estimated), the highest yield in history. The total output this year increased by 3.9 million dan compared to last year, and by 6.73 million dan compared to 1952. In 1949, China's total cotton output was 8.8888 million dan, and this year's output exceeds the 1949 output by 2.7 times.

    The national average yield of cotton per unit area this year is 38 jin of ginned cotton, 3 jin more than in 1955.

    The cotton planting area this year is 86.52 million mu, 8.48 million mu less than the original target (95 million mu) of the First Five-Year Plan, a decrease of more than 8.9%. Because the average yield increased by 3.6 jin compared to the original target (34.4 jin), the task of increasing cotton production as stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan was overfulfilled.

    This year, many large-scale high-yield cotton fields have emerged in various regions. According to incomplete statistics: there are 3.5 million mu with a yield of more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, accounting for 4% of the total cotton fields; there are 5.7 million mu with a yield of more than 80 jin and less than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, accounting for 6.6% of the total cotton field area. Some counties in the double-cropping cotton area of the Yangtze River Basin have achieved particularly outstanding results this year. According to preliminary investigations, in Macheng County, Hubei Province, this year, there are 3,000 mu of double-cropping thousand-jin fields (wheat and seed cotton) with a total output of 1,000 jin or more, and 4,137 mu of high-yield fields with a yield of 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

    Last year, only a few cotton fields reached the target of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. This year, four counties and one city have reached this target. This year, six counties have an average yield of more than 80 jin and less than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu; forty counties and cities (incomplete statistics) have an average yield of more than 60 jin and less than 80 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

    In terms of provinces and cities, Zhejiang Province and Shanghai have an average yield of 60 jin of ginned cotton this year. The average yield this year exceeding 40 jin includes: Xinjiang, Hubei, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hebei and Beijing.

    This year, the unit yield of cotton is also very low in some areas. Taking Guizhou as an example, the average yield per mu in the province is only 16.3 jin. There are also areas this year where the unit yield, although not low compared to the general situation, is lower than the indicators previously achieved in the region, such as Shanxi. This year, the unit yield in the province is 38.3 jin, 6.7 jin lower than in 1952.

    今年的棉花生产
    今年棉花的总产量三千二百八十万担（预计），是历史上产量最高的一年。今年的总产量比去年增加三百九十万担，比1952年增加六百七十三万担。1949年我国棉花总产量是八百八十八万八千担，今年的产量，超过1949年产量二点七倍。
    今年棉花的全国平均单位面积产量合皮棉三十八斤，比1955年多三斤。
    今年的植棉面积八千六百五十二万亩，比第一个五年计划原订指标（九千五百万亩）少了八百四十八万亩，减少8.9％多。由于平均产量比原订指标（三十四点四斤）提高了三点六斤，因而超额完成了第一个五年计划规定的棉花增产任务。
    今年各地出现许多大面积丰产棉田。据不完全统计：亩产皮棉一百斤以上的有三百五十万亩，占整个棉田的4％；亩产皮棉八十斤以上，一百斤以下的有五百七十万亩，占棉田总面积6.6％。长江流域两熟棉区的一些县，今年的丰产成绩尤为突出。据初步调查，湖北省麻城县今年棉、麦两季合计产量达到一千斤（小麦、籽棉）以上的两熟千斤田。有三千亩，亩产皮棉二百斤的丰产田有四千一百三十七亩。
    去年只有少数棉田达到亩产皮棉一百斤的指标，今年达到这个指标的有四个县、一个市。今年平均亩产皮棉八十斤以上，一百斤以下的有六个县；平均亩产皮棉六十斤以上八十斤以下的有四十个县、市（不完全统计）。
    以省、市为单位来说，今年平均产量达到皮棉六十斤的有浙江省和上海市；今年平均产量超过四十斤的有：新疆、湖北、甘肃、陕西、河北等省（区）和北京市。
    今年也有部分地区的棉花单位产量很低，以贵州为例，全省平均亩产量只有十六点三斤。今年也有这样的地区，它的单位产量和一般情况比虽然不低，但是比本地区过去曾达到的指标却降低了，山西就是这样。今年全省单位产量三十八点三斤，比1952年低了六点七斤。
