　　Successors on the Sports Field
　　— A Record of the Beijing Municipal Juvenile Amateur Sports School

　　Once I went to the Shichahai Gymnasium and happened to catch the gymnastics class of the Beijing Municipal Juvenile Amateur Sports School. A group of fourteen- and fifteen-year-old children were doing gymnastics activities there. Several coaches were also busy guiding them on the side. Whether practicing the single and parallel bars, the uneven bars, or the pommel horse, rings, or balance beam, these children always performed each movement carefully, again and again; the coaches also patiently taught them again and again. When a difficult movement was successfully completed, look at the joyful smiles on the faces of the coaches and children. "It's okay, try again next time," the coach would encourage a child who kept failing at a movement.
　　Speaking of the Beijing Municipal Juvenile Amateur Sports School, people know that it is one of the first three juvenile amateur sports schools established in China. It was established in December 1955 and has just turned two years old. In these short two years, it has made considerable progress. Currently, it has expanded from the initial three departments to six departments: track and field, gymnastics, swimming, basketball, football, and volleyball; the number of students has also increased from the initial three hundred to over seven hundred and fifty. The vast majority of these seven hundred and fifty-plus children are middle school students aged fourteen to seventeen. They spare four or five hours every week after school to come to the amateur sports school for classes. The school has prepared excellent learning conditions for them at the Xian Nong Tan Stadium, Beihai Stadium, Shichahai Gymnasium, Beijing Gymnasium, and other locations, and has also hired many professional sports workers and athletes to be their coaches. These hundreds of children are training in such a good environment.
　　In the past two years, in this garden cultivating seedlings, under the careful cultivation of the gardeners, we have seen growth from sprouting to flowering and fruiting. In the past, Beijing's young people rarely got points in various sports meets. Is it that sports activities were not carried out enough? No, there are many young people in Beijing who love sports. It should mainly be said that they have not undergone formal training, and their sports technical level has improved very slowly. Since the establishment of this school, Beijing's young athletes have repeatedly come to the fore. At the First National Juvenile Sports Games held last August, the Beijing delegation won the men's and women's gymnastics championships, and the men's and women's track and field runners-up. More than 80% of the members of this delegation were students of the Beijing Municipal Juvenile Amateur Sports School. Kong Lingrong, a student from the track and field department of this school, jumped over one meter and fifty-four centimeters at the National Track and Field Games in October this year, defeating Fu Xueyan, the national record holder for women's high jump last year, and won second place in the women's Group A high jump. Kong Lingrong is only seventeen years old this year, and in 1955, when she came to the amateur sports school, she could only jump one meter twenty or thirty centimeters. In addition, in other national competitions involving young athletes, Beijing's young athletes have achieved good results. Currently, among those studying at this school, one has reached the standard of a first-class athlete, forty-seven have reached the standard of a second-class athlete, and even more have reached the standard of a third-class athlete. The achievement of these results cannot be entirely attributed to the amateur sports school, but the four or five hours of formal training that the amateur sports school provides every week has played a decisive role.
　　The children studying at the juvenile amateur sports school do not think that improving their sports technical level is enough. They all regard actively helping to promote sports activities in their own schools as an obligation. Many people have become capable assistants to school physical education teachers. Four students from Beijing No. 22 Middle School participated in volleyball training at the juvenile amateur sports school. While learning, they helped the physical education teacher to develop volleyball activities in their own school. In the past, not many people liked to play volleyball, but after their promotion, the number of people participating in volleyball activities greatly increased. Students participating in amateur sports school not only have good sports skills, but also good grades. It is easier to achieve results by having them take the lead in developing school sports activities.
　　Athletes in New China should not only have a strong body and good skills, but also good moral character. Therefore, the Beijing Municipal Juvenile Amateur Sports School also attaches great importance to the moral character education of students in daily training. When enrolling students, they strictly adhere to the standard of excellent academic performance and conduct. If the academic performance is not good enough, or the conduct is not up to par, then don't think about entering this school. Usually, the amateur school also constantly examines and educates students. One student, because of playing too much, failed several subjects in his original school. When the amateur sports school discovered this situation, they stopped him from studying for a month and a half. The staff and coaches of the amateur sports school are not only in charge of training techniques; they are constantly paying attention to how to train the children into well-rounded individuals.
　　In two years, the Beijing Municipal Juvenile Amateur Sports School has already blossomed and borne fruit. In the future, it will bloom more beautiful flowers and bear more abundant fruits, and deliver more new forces to the sports front.

　　运动场上的接班人
　　——记北京市青少年业余体育学校
　　燕巴
    有一次我到什刹海体育馆，正赶上北京市青少年业余体育学校体操班的学生们在上课。一群十四、五岁的孩子在那里作体操活动。几个教练也忙着在旁边指导。无论是练单双杠、高低杠或练鞍马、吊环、平衡木，这些孩子们把每一个动作，总是认真地作了一遍又一遍；教练们也是不厌其烦地教了一遍又一遍。一个繁难的动作作成功了，看，教练和孩子的脸上带着多么欣慰的笑容。“没关系，下次再来。”当一个孩子老作不好一个动作时，教练又这样鼓励他。
    谈起北京市青少年业余体育学校来，人们都知道它是我国最先成立的三所青少年业余体育学校中的一所。它从1955年12月成立，到现在刚满两年。在短短的两年里，它有了不小的发展。目前，它已从最初的三个科扩大到田径、体操、游泳、篮球、足球和排球六个科；学生也从最初的三百多人发展到七百五十多人。这七百五十多个孩子绝大多数是十四岁到十七岁的中学生。他们每星期在课余之暇，抽出四、五小时来到业余体育学校上课。学校在先农坛体育场、北海体育场、什刹海体育馆、北京体育馆等处给他们准备了很好的学习条件，又聘请了很多有专业技术的体育工作者和运动员们作他们的教练。这几百个孩子，就在这样良好的环境中锻炼着。
    两年来，在这个培育幼苗的园圃里，在园丁们的悉心栽培下，已经看到从萌芽到开花结果。过去，北京市的青少年们，在各次运动会上，很少能得到分。说是体育运动开展得不够吗？不是的，北京市那么多青少年，爱运动的可不是少数。主要还应该说是他们没有经过正规训练，运动技术水平提高很慢。自从这所学校建立后，北京市的青少年运动员们就一再崭露头角。在去年8月举行的全国第一届少年体育运动大会上，北京市代表队就得了体操的男女冠军，田径的男女亚军。这个代表队的成员有80％以上是北京市青少年业余体育学校的学生。这个学校田径科学生孔令蓉，在今年10月的全国田径运动大会上跳过了一公尺五十四公分，战胜了去年女子跳高全国纪录保持者傅雪雁，得了女子甲组跳高第二名。孔令蓉今年才十七岁，1955年到业余体育学校时，只能跳一公尺二三十公分。另外，在其他几次有青少年运动员参加的全国性的比赛中，北京市的青少年运动员都取得了不坏的成绩。现在在这个学校学习的，已有一人达到一级运动员标准，四十七人达到二级运动员标准，达到三级运动员标准的就更多了。这些成绩的获得，当然不能完全归功于业余体育学校，但业余体育学校对他们的每星期四、五小时的正规训练，是起了决定性作用的。
    在青少年业余体育学校学习的孩子们，他们并没有认为提高了运动技术水平就够了。他们都把积极帮助推动自己学校的体育运动作为一种义务。有不少人已成为学校体育教师的得力助手。北京市二十二中学有四个学生参加了青少年业余体育学校排球科学习。他们一面学习，一面帮助体育教师在自己的学校里开展排球运动。过去爱玩排球的人不多，经过他们的推动，参加排球活动的大大增加了。参加业余体育学校学习的学生，不但运动技术好，而且功课好，由他们带头开展学校体育活动，比较容易收效。
    新中国的运动员，不仅要有强健的身体、良好的技术，而且要有良好的道德品质。因此北京市青少年业余体育学校在日常训练中，对学生的道德品质教育同样很重视。在录取学生时，他们严格掌握了学品兼优的标准，如果课业不到良好，操行不够五分，就别想进这学校。平时，业余学校对学生也不断地考查和教育。有一个学生，因为贪玩，原来学校的功课好几门不及格。业余体育学校发现了这个情况，就让他停止学习一个半月。业余体育学校的工作人员和教练们并不是只管训练技术，他们无时无刻地还在注意，怎样把孩子们训练成为全面发展的人。
    两年中，北京市青少年业余体育学校已经开花结果。今后它将开更美的花，结更丰硕的果，为体育战线上输送更多的新生力量。
