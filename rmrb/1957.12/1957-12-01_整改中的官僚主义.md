Bureaucracy Undergoing Rectification

　　Recently, the leading cadres of some units in Tianjin that have entered the rectification phase have made self-criticisms to the masses regarding their shortcomings and errors in ideological style. The vast majority of comrades were sincere in their attitude and made profound self-examinations. However, a small number of comrades adopted a perfunctory attitude, only making superficial and insignificant self-criticisms, and some even had ordinary cadres write their self-criticism drafts for them. Dong Pusan, the manager of the Heping District Welfare Company, only gave a few topics and then asked the Party branch secretary to write his self-criticism draft for him. When the secretary asked him how to write it, he said: "Just write it however you understand it!" Jin Zilin, the deputy director of the Nankai District Handicraft Industry Cooperative, had someone else write his self-criticism draft for him, but he didn't even read it carefully before taking it to the meeting to read aloud, resulting in a very bad impression.

　　The purpose of the rectification campaign is to rectify the bureaucratic tendencies of these leading cadres, and what they need to examine and correct is also bureaucracy (and of course, some other bad tendencies). However, who would have thought that while they are talking about overcoming bureaucracy, they are actually committing bureaucracy? It seems that the bureaucratic tendencies of comrades like Dong Pusan and Jin Zilin have grown like a malignant tumor on their bodies, and they cannot be removed without gritting their teeth and seeking medical treatment.

### 整改中的官僚主义

　　整改中的官僚主义
    最近天津市转入整改阶段的一些单位的主要领导干部，都向群众检查了思想作风上的缺点和错误。绝大多数同志态度诚恳，检讨深刻。有少数同志对此却采取了应付过关态度，只作了一些皮毛的、不关痛痒的检查，甚至有的竟让一般干部代写检讨稿。和平区福利公司经理董璞三，只出了几个题目，就交党支部干事替他代写检讨稿，这个干事问他怎么写，他说：“你怎么认识就怎么写吧！”南开区手工业联社副主任金子霖，别人替他写好了检讨稿，他看都没有认真看，就拿到会上去念，结果念得结结巴巴，影响很坏。
    整风本来就是要整掉这些领导干部身上的官僚主义，他们要检查要纠正的也是官僚主义（当然还有其他一些坏主义）。但是，谁能够想到，他们嘴里在念着要克服官僚主义，而实际上却正在犯官僚主义呢？看来，董璞三、金子霖等同志的官僚主义毛病，已经像一个毒瘤一样长在他们的身上，不咬紧牙关忍痛求医，是割除不了的。
