    Is This a Minor Matter?
    Amidst the chorus of increased production and bumper harvests, we published the letter from Comrades Ai Fen and others. They questioned why the Yongsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Yuanyang County suffered a severe loss in production during a normal year with a relatively good harvest. They questioned who was responsible for the production decrease in this cooperative.
    Perhaps some would say that this only happened in one cooperative, and the production decrease was only over 800,000 jin, which doesn't seem like a major event. We say that within the nationwide agricultural front's reports of success, this is indeed a small, individual matter. However, the nature of this matter is a major event that deserves widespread attention. Are similar problems to those that occurred in the Yongsheng Cooperative non-existent in other places? Of course, the situation may not be as severe as in the Yongsheng Cooperative, but are there not areas and cooperatives that should have increased production but instead decreased it, or had the conditions for increased production but did not achieve it? Such areas and cooperatives are probably not very isolated cases!
    While we are filled with joy in praising advanced achievements, advanced areas, and advanced people, we also need to turn our attention to backward areas and backward corners, listen to the voices there, and uncover the problems there, even if it is just in a small corner.

### 这是一件小事么？

    这是一件小事么？
    在一片增产、丰收声中，我们发表了蔼棻等同志的这封来信。他们质问原阳县永胜农业社为什么在平年偏丰的年景里却遭到了严重的减产损失？他们质问谁是造成这个社减产的责任者？
    也许有人会说，这只是发生在一个社里的事情，减产也只有八十多万斤，似乎算不得一件什么大事。我们说，在全国农业战线纷纷报捷声中，这确是一件个别的小事；但是，这件事情的性质，却是一件值得引起普遍注意的大事。类似永胜社发生的这样问题，难道在其他一些地方就没有么？当然，情况也许不会像永胜社这样严重，但是，本来应该增产的却减了产，本来有条件增产却没有增产，这样的地区，这样的社，恐怕不会是很个别的吧！
    我们满怀喜悦地赞扬先进的成绩、先进的地区、先进的人，同时也需要把目光向落后的地区、落后的角落注视一下，倾听一下这里的声音，发掘一下这里的问题，那怕只是一个小小的角落。
