　　The Journey of Heat
　　Gao Shiqi

　　The weather is getting colder day by day. The colder the weather, the more people need heat.

　　Speaking of heat, it is easy to think of the sun, stoves, red-hot iron blocks, electricity, boiling water, hot soup, and so on.

　　What is heat? According to science, heat is a form of energy, just like light, electricity, atomic energy, radio waves, food, and fuel.

　　Where does heat come from? The sun is the greatest source of heat. It constantly radiates its heat into space.

　　The heat that reaches the Earth's surface accounts for only one two-hundred-millionth of the total heat it emits. This small amount of heat is equivalent to the heat produced by burning 600,000 tons of coal per second. If the entire surface of the Earth were covered with a two-hundred-meter-thick layer of ice, the heat radiated onto the ground by the sun would be enough to melt it all.

　　The sun is the commander-in-chief of heat, directing the battle between heat and cold. Heat also has large and small commanders, and fire is one of them. Fire is a phenomenon of combustion, which we can see everywhere: in charcoal basins, in coal stoves, in gas stoves, on kerosene lamps, in blast furnaces, and in various situations where fire is used.

　　Electricity is also a heat-generating commander. Copper wires turn red and hot when electricity passes through them. Electric lights, electric stoves, and electric irons all get very hot.

　　In addition, friction, impact, and compressed air all generate heat; the digestion of food, the combustion of fuel, and the fission of atomic nuclei are also sources of heat.

　　In daily life, we can always find that heat is constantly on the move. Running from the sun's embrace to the Earth is its longest journey; running from the stove to every corner of the room, from the bottom of the boiling water pot to the surface, is its short-distance race.

　　How does heat travel? According to scientists' analysis, there are three ways for heat to travel, that is, there are three methods for heat transfer.

　　The first method: called conduction.

　　If you touch a red-hot iron plate with your hand, you will shout "hot"; if you walk barefoot on the cement floor heated by the sun, you will feel your soles burning. These are all manifestations of conduction.

　　If you put a bottle of hot water on an ice block to cool it, the bottle of hot water will quickly become cold and turn into ice water. This is also an example of conduction, as the hot water loses its heat upon contact with the ice block.

　　In conduction, heat always travels from hot objects to cold objects until the temperature between the two objects is equal.

　　Solids, liquids, and gases can all conduct heat, with solids being the most convenient for heat transfer.

　　Among solids, metals conduct heat the fastest and are the best conductors of heat. Wood, cloth, rubber, and paper are not good at conducting heat and are insulators rather than conductors. Therefore, the handles of stoves and pots are made of wood or rubber.

　　Non-flowing air is also not good at conducting heat. Therefore, double-paned windows are often used in building houses to keep out the cold and heat.

　　The second method of heat transfer is convection. The flow of water and the flow of air can both transfer heat.

　　When water is heated and boiled in a glass container, we will observe that the hot water rises and the cold water sinks. This is a manifestation of water convection.

　　Air movement creates wind. Whether it is a strong wind or a gentle breeze, it is the result of the convection of hot and cold air. This is a manifestation of air convection.

　　Generally, modern houses have upper and lower windows to circulate air, allowing hot air to escape from the upper window and fresh, cold air to flow in from the lower window.

　　However, in crowded rooms, such as cinemas and auditoriums, such arrangements are not enough, and ventilation equipment is necessary, using electric fans to agitate the air and make it circulate as much as possible.

　　The third method of heat transfer is radiation (that is, radiating heat to the surroundings). Every heat-generating body constantly radiates its heat in all directions. Radiation does not rely on matter and can occur even in a vacuum. The sun's heat and light, as well as various other radiations, continuously pass through a vacuum region of 150 million kilometers to reach the Earth's surface, taking only eight minutes. It does not leave any heat to the vacuum except for transferring heat to the Earth and other things it encounters.

　　Fire is also a heat-generating body, and it also radiates its heat in all directions. Therefore, in fire-fighting work, firefighters have to wear masks and protective clothing to avoid the threat of flame heat!

　　These are the secrets of the journey of heat. When people master these secrets, they will be able to achieve continuous victories in the struggle against cold and heat.

　　热的旅行
　　高士其
    天气一天比一天冷了。天气越冷，人们就越需要热。
    提起热来，就很容易想到太阳、火炉、烧红的铁块、电、开水和热汤等等。
    热是什么呢？依照科学的说法，热是一种能，就像光、电、原子能、无线电波、食物和燃料一样，都是能。
    热是从哪里来的呢？太阳是热的最大源泉。它不断地向宇宙空间放射出它的热。
    这种热射到地球的表面的只占它所发出的总热量二万万分之一，这一点热量，已经相等于每秒钟烧六十万吨煤所产出的热。如果全地球的表面都结成二百公尺厚的冰层，太阳所射到地面上的热量，也足够把它全部融化。
    太阳是热的总司令，它指挥着热和寒冷作战。热还有大大小小的指挥官，火就是其中的一种。火是一种燃烧的现象，我们到处都可以见到它：在木炭盆里、在煤火炉里、在煤气炉里、在煤油灯上、在高炉里、在大大小小用火的场合。
    电也是一名发热的指挥官，铜线在通过电流就会发红、发热，电灯、电炉、电熨斗都很烫。
    此外，摩擦、撞击和压缩空气，也都会发热；食物经过消化和燃料经过燃烧以及原子核的破裂也都是热的来源。
    在日常生活中，我们时刻都可以发现，热不停的在奔走旅行。从太阳怀里跑到地球身上，这是它最远的一次长征；从火炉里跑到房间的每一个角落，从开水锅底跑到水面，这是它短距离的赛跑。
    热是怎样在旅行呢？经过科学家的分析，热的旅行有三种途径，这就是说，有三种方法可以传热。
    第一种方法：叫做接触传热。
    如果你用手来摸烧红的铁板，你就会大声叫“烫”；如果你光着脚在太阳晒热的水门汀地上走动，你就会觉得脚底非常发烧。这些都是接触传热的表现。
    如果你拿一瓶热水放在冰块上冰，这一瓶热水很快地就变冷了，变成冰水了。这也是接触传热的一个例子，热水接触到冰块而失去它的热。
    在接触传热中，热的旅行，都是从热的物体身上跑到冷的物体身上去的，一直到这两种物体之间的温度相等为止。
    不论固体、液体和气体，都能接触传热，而以固体传热显得最为便当。
    在固体的行列中，金属的传热最快，是最好的导热体，木头、布、橡皮、纸都不善于传热，都是阻热体，而非导热体。所以炉子和锅子的手柄，都是用木头或橡皮做成的。
    不流动的空气也不善于传热，因而在建造房屋的时候，为了御寒和防热，常用两层玻璃窗。
    第二种传热的方法，是流动传热。水的流动和空气的流动都可以传热。
    把水放在玻璃器皿里加热烧开，我们就会观察到热水上升，冷水下降。这就是水流动传热的表现。
    空气动荡而成风，不论大风或是微风，都是热空气和冷空气对流的结果。这就是空气流动传热的表现。
    一般现代化的房屋，都开辟有上下两个窗口，以流通空气，让热空气从上面的窗口奔出去；让新鲜的冷空气从下面的窗口流进来。
    但是，在人口众多的房间里，例如电影院和大礼堂，这样的装置还不够用，就必须有通风设备，用电扇来鼓动空气，使它尽量的流通。
    第三种传热的方法，就是辐射传热（这就是说：向周围放射热气）。每一种发热体，都不断的向四面八方放射出它的热。辐射传热，是不依靠物质的，就是在真空中也能进行。太阳的热和光以及其他各种辐射都一直不停的穿过一万五千万公里的真空区域，才达到地球的表面，费时间不过八分钟。它除了把热传给地球和它所遇到别的东西以外，并不把任何一点热留给真空。
    火也是一种发热体，它也是向四面八方放射它的热的。所以在灭火工作中，救火队员不得不戴上面具和披上保护衣，以避免火焰热气的威胁呀！
    这些都是热的旅行的秘密。当人们掌握了这些秘密之后，在御寒和防热的斗争中，就能取得不断的胜利。
