Maintaining National Law and Rectifying School Discipline
　　Beijing Universities and Colleges Deal with a Batch of Bad Elements

　　(Our newspaper's report) Recently, in order to maintain national law and rectify school discipline, Beijing universities and colleges have dealt with a batch of hooligans and thieves among students, severely cracking down on the activities of hooligans and thieves, and purifying the student ranks. Many schools held mass meetings; many school newspapers, radio broadcasts, and big-character posters were mobilized to launch a vigorous struggle against hooligans and thieves. Peking University, Beijing Normal University, and other schools also held anti-hooligan and anti-thief exhibitions, systematically exposing the crimes of hooligans and thieves, and conducting a vivid education for the vast number of students.

　　These hooligans and thieves among the students disrupted public order inside and outside the schools and stole property, causing great losses to the country and the people. This not only hindered the teaching work of the schools, but also brought great difficulties to the study and life of the victims.

　　The vast majority of these degenerate elements among the college students who were severely punished by national law and school discipline came from exploiting class families. Due to their attachment to the decadent and degenerate parasitic life of the past and the poisoning of pornographic publications, they became corrupted and degenerated, embarking on a shameful path of betraying the people. Wu Qinlin, a thief at Peking University, came from a landlord family and had been accustomed to a life of pleasure and corruption since childhood. After entering university, his brother gave him 20 yuan a month for living expenses, which was still not enough for him to squander. Recently, in just over half a year, he stole more than 70 times, and the stolen property included two watches, one camera, more than 40 books, more than 350 yuan in cash, and 250 yuan in meal tickets. He has now been sentenced to seven years in prison. Lu Ling, a thief at Beijing Normal University, stole a German-made 72-bass accordion, two German-made Rolleicord cameras, as well as film and parts, worth more than 2,300 yuan from March to July this year, and has now been sentenced to seven years in prison. Meng Xianwen, a hooligan at Renmin University, twice molested young girls and attempted rape, but was discovered by classmates and failed. He has now been expelled from school. A considerable number of hooligans and thieves are also extremely reactionary politically. Li Yansheng, a hooligan and thief at Peking University, was a backbone element of the rightists and an editorial board member of the reactionary publication "Square". During the rectification movement, he frantically attacked the Party. During the anti-rightist struggle, he twice sneaked into female dormitories to steal valuable clothing such as leather coats and suitcases. When selling the stolen goods, he wore the stolen school badge and left the badge number, attempting to frame others (he has now been arrested). Peng Shude, a thief at Peking University, came from a landlord family and consistently harbored animosity towards the new society. He had been warned by the school for violating school discipline. Harboring resentment, he openly stated, "I will do something bad every day." For more than a year, he stole more than 40 books from Xinhua Bookstore, stole and burned three large German dictionaries from the library, as well as wool sweaters, notebooks, and homework from his classmates, and tore up more than 60 letters from classmates' relatives and friends. He has recently been sent to labor re-education.

　　The measures taken by various schools to resolutely crack down on hooligans and thieves have been warmly supported by the vast number of students. Many students have posted big-character posters expressing their determination to resolutely fight against hooligans and thieves, and to raise their vigilance so as not to give hooligans and thieves any chance to take advantage of them.

    维护国法整顿校纪
　　北京高等学校处理一批坏分子
    本报讯　最近，北京高等学校为维护国法、整顿校纪，处理了一批学生中的流氓、盗窃分子，狠狠打击了流氓、盗窃分子活动的气焰，纯洁了学生的队伍。许多学校召开了群众大会；许多学校的校刊、广播、大字报都动员起来，对流氓、盗窃分子展开了有力的斗争。北京大学、北京师范大学等校还举办了反流氓、盗窃分子展览会，系统地揭露了流氓、盗窃分子的罪行，对广大学生进行了一次生动的教育。
    学生中这些流氓、盗窃分子在校内、外破坏公共秩序、偷窃财物，给国家和人民群众造成了很大的损失，这样不但妨害了学校的教学工作，而且给失主的学习、生活带来很大的困难。
    这些受到国法、校纪严厉制裁的大学生中的败类，绝大多数出身于剥削阶级家庭，由于留恋过去腐朽、糜烂的寄生生活，以及受黄色书刊的毒害，腐化堕落，走上了可耻的背叛人民的道路。北京大学盗窃犯吴勤林，地主家庭出身，从小就过惯了享乐、腐化的生活，到大学后，他哥哥每月给他生活费二十元，仍然不够他挥霍，最近，仅仅半年多的时间，偷窃七十多次，窃取的财物包括手表二块、照相机一架、书籍四十多本、现款三百五十多元和饭票二百五十元，现被判徒刑七年。北京师范大学盗窃犯吕凌，从今年3月到7月，偷窃了德国制72贝斯手风琴一架、德国制柔莱考尔照相机两架以及胶卷、零件多件，价值二千三百多元，现被判徒刑七年。人民大学流氓孟宪文两次猥亵幼女，还企图奸淫，被同学发现未遂，现已被开除学籍。有相当一部分流氓、盗窃分子在政治上也是极端反动的，北京大学流氓兼盗窃犯李燕生是右派骨干分子，反动刊物“广场”的编委，整风运动期间猖狂向党进攻，反右派斗争时，两次潜入女生宿舍偷窃皮衣、皮箱等贵重衣物多件，销赃时佩带了偷来的校徽，并留下校徽的号码，企图嫁祸于人（现已逮捕）。北京大学盗窃犯彭树德，地主家庭出身，一贯敌视新社会，曾因违反学校纪律受到学校警告处分，他怀恨在心，竟公然表示：“每天要干一件坏事”。一年多以来，他从新华书店偷书四十多本，偷窃并烧毁了图书馆三本大德华辞典和同班学生的毛衣、笔记本、作业多件，而且撕毁了同学的六十多封亲友来信，最近已送劳动教养。
    各校坚决打击流氓、盗窃分子的措施，受到广大学生的热烈拥护，许多学生纷纷贴大字报表示一定要坚决和流氓、盗窃分子进行斗争，并且提高警惕，不给流氓、盗窃分子以可乘之机。（次明）
