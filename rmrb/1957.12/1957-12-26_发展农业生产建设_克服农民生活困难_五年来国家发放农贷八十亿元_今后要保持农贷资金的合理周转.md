Xinhua News Agency, December 24th -- During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the agricultural loans issued by the state played a significant role in developing agricultural production, promoting agricultural collectivization, and overcoming farmers' living difficulties. According to statistics, the cumulative amount of agricultural loans issued by the state in the past five years has reached 8 billion yuan, with an average of about 70 yuan in loans received by each farm household nationwide.

From 1953 to 1955, the state issued more than 3.1 billion yuan in agricultural loans, promoting agricultural production and the development of mutual aid and cooperative organizations. In 1956, when the high tide of agricultural collectivization arrived across the country, the state issued nearly 3.4 billion yuan in loans. Among them, 700 million yuan was a cooperative fund loan for poor peasants. This loan had a long term and low interest. According to statistics on more than 400 million yuan in loans issued by twenty-one provinces and cities, a total of more than 25 million poor and lower-middle peasant households were helped to overcome the difficulties of joining the cooperative, with an average of 17 yuan in loans received per household. Across the country, more than 40 million poor and lower-middle peasant households were helped to overcome the difficulties of paying share funds to join the cooperative. The issuance of this loan greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of poor peasants to take the road of collectivization, strengthened the unity between poor and middle peasants, and helped agricultural cooperatives raise production funds. Many poor peasants compared this loan to "timely rain in a drought" and "sending charcoal in the snow."

In the past five years, approximately 21.8% of the agricultural loans issued by the state were used for agricultural capital construction, and approximately 43.1% were used for production expenses. These loans timely helped agricultural cooperatives overcome the difficulties of funds needed for water conservancy construction, the addition of draught animals, farm tools, fertilizers, and the development of sideline production. According to incomplete statistics from five provinces including Anhui, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Hebei, the production loans of more than 270 million yuan issued by the state in 1956 helped agricultural cooperatives dig more than 720,000 wells, build more than 90,000 water conservancy projects, purchase more than 140,000 head of draught animals, 100,000 double-wheeled double-shared plows, more than 280,000 new-style farm tools, more than 130,000 waterwheels, and more than 200 million catties of fertilizer.

The state has also issued huge loans to support immigrant land reclamation. Last year alone, Heilongjiang, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces issued more than 50 million yuan in loans. Among them, Heilongjiang Province's immigrant land reclamation loans have helped 140,000 immigrants reclaim 88,000 hectares of wasteland, spring sow more than 40,000 hectares, add more than 32,000 head of livestock, build more than 5,000 houses, and establish more than 400 new villages. In addition, active support has also been given to state-owned farms and fishery and animal husbandry production.

In addition to issuing general agricultural loans, the state also issued interest-free advance purchase deposits every year. The cumulative amount in the past five years is about 2 billion yuan.

The loans issued by the state have also helped farmers overcome difficulties in their lives. In the past five years, a total of more than 1.28 billion yuan in living loans has been issued, accounting for more than 16% of the total agricultural loans. In the past year alone, the state directly issued and lent 700 million yuan in living loans to farmers through credit cooperatives.

In the past five years, the state's loans to help farmers in disaster areas produce for self-salvation and overcome natural disasters have totaled more than 640 million yuan. These loans helped farmers in flood-stricken areas overcome the difficulties of drainage, land restoration, and rush planting; in drought-stricken areas, they solved the difficulties of farmers in drought prevention and drought resistance, such as building water conservancy projects, purchasing drought-resistant tools, protecting seedlings, and conserving soil moisture.

According to a person in charge of the People's Bank of China, the state's agricultural loan funds and credit cooperative funds currently amount to more than 5 billion yuan, which is a great force in supporting agricultural production. If these funds can be fully circulated and used, they can basically meet the needs of agricultural production. Therefore, for a considerable period of time in the future, under normal circumstances, the state will no longer substantially increase new agricultural loan targets, and the loans needed by various localities each year must rely on doing a good job in recovering loans that are due. He believes that maintaining the rational turnover of agricultural loan funds is the main way to solve the problem of agricultural loan funds in the future. (Attached pictures)

    发展农业生产建设　克服农民生活困难
    五年来国家发放农贷八十亿元
    今后要保持农贷资金的合理周转
    新华社24日讯　第一个五年计划期间国家发放的农业贷款，对发展农业生产、促进农业合作化、克服农民生活困难等方面起了重大作用。据统计，五年来国家发放的农业贷款累计已达八十亿元，全国农户平均每户得到贷款七十元左右。
    在1953年到1955年期间，国家共发放了三十一亿多元农业贷款；促进了农业生产和互助合作组织的发展。1956年全国农业合作化高潮到来时，国家又发放了近三十四亿元贷款。其中七亿元为贫农合作基金贷款，这笔贷款期限长、利息低。据二十一个省市所放出的四亿多元贷款统计，共帮助二千五百多万户贫农和下中农克服了入社困难，平均每户得到贷款十七元。全国共帮助四千多万户贫农、下中农克服了入社缴纳股份基金的困难。由于这笔贷款的发放，大大鼓舞了贫农走合作化道路的积极性，加强贫中农之间的团结，帮助农业社筹集了生产资金。许多贫农把这项贷款比作“旱天逢雨”、“雪里送炭”。
    五年来，国家发放的农业贷款中约有21.8％是作为农业基本建设费用的。约有43.1％作为生产费用。这些贷款及时帮助农业社克服了兴修水利、添置耕畜、农具、肥料以及发展副业生产所需资金的困难。据安徽、黑龙江、陕西、山西、河北等五个省不完全统计，1956年国家发放的两亿七千多万元生产贷款，帮助农业社打井七十二万多眼，兴修水利工程九万多处，购买耕畜十四万多头、双轮双铧犁十万部、新式农具二十八万多件、水车十三万多部、肥料两亿多斤。
    国家为了支持移民垦荒，也发放了巨额的贷款。仅去年黑龙江、甘肃、青海三省就发放了五千多万元贷款。其中黑龙江省移民垦荒贷款，已帮助十四万个移民开荒八万八千垧，春播四万多垧，添置牧畜三万二千多头，修建房屋五千多间，建立新村四百多个。另外，对国营农场、渔业、牧业生产也都给予积极支持。
    国家除发放一般农业贷款以外，每年还发放了没有利息的预购定金。五年来累计约达二十亿元左右。
    国家发放的贷款，还帮助农民克服了生活上的困难。五年来累计共发放生活贷款达十二亿八千多万元，占农业贷款总数的16％以上。仅去年一年，国家直接发放和通过信用社贷给农民的生活贷款达七亿元。
    五年来国家在帮助灾区农民生产自救、战胜自然灾害等方面的贷款累计达六亿四千多万元。这些贷款在水灾地区帮助农民克服了排水、复田、抢种的困难；在旱灾地区，解决农民防旱、抗旱中兴修水利、购置抗旱工具、保苗、保墒等等的困难问题。
    据中国人民银行负责人说，目前国家的农贷资金和信用社资金约有五十多亿元，这是支援农业生产一个很大的力量。这些资金，如能充分周转运用，基本上可以满足农业生产需要。因此，今后在相当时期内，在一般情况下，国家不再大量增加新的农贷指标，各地每年所需要的贷款，必须依靠做好到期贷款收回工作。他认为，保持农贷资金的合理周转，是今后解决农贷资金需要问题的主要途径。（附图片）
