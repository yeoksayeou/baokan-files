Xinhua News Agency, December 30th - According to United Press International, Indonesian President Sukarno, in a written reply on the 29th to questions posed by a United Press International correspondent in Jakarta, elaborated on Indonesia's position in the struggle to recover West Irian.

The United Press International questions and President Sukarno's responses are as follows:

Question: What are the political and historical grounds on which Indonesia bases its claim to West Irian?

Answer: The political and historical grounds, and, I might even say, the legal grounds, on which Indonesia bases its claims and rights to West Irian have been explained several times by the Indonesian delegation in the United Nations debates on the West Irian issue.

I can briefly state them again: The political and historical grounds lie in the fact that West Irian is an important part of the Indonesian political entity formerly known as the Netherlands East Indies;

Also in the fact that the people of Indonesia (including West Irian) have been united for many centuries, not only due to Dutch rule, but also due to their history, due to their common struggle for national survival and eventual freedom;

Also in the fact that the Indonesian people declared the independence of all of Indonesia on August 17, 1945, and subsequently fought to consolidate this independence;

Also in the fact that the Netherlands, in formal agreements and solemn guarantees made in the United Nations, had promised to promote complete sovereignty in 1949, and that the Dutch government should formally transfer complete and irrevocable sovereignty over Indonesia, thereby recognizing the independence of the Indonesian state.

No agreement was ever reached to place the state of West Irian outside the boundaries of the independent and sovereign Indonesian state.

In addition, West Irian is also considered a place of suffering in the struggle for independence, as most of the prominent leaders spent many years in the infamous Boven Digoel camp in West Irian as exiles or prisoners.

This symbolic interpretation greatly strengthens the determination to liberate West Irian.

Question: Do the same considerations apply to the rest of New Guinea?

Answer: Since East New Guinea is not part of the Netherlands East Indies and the Indonesian political entity, these considerations naturally do not apply to East New Guinea, and we have no claim to East New Guinea at all.

Question: How will Indonesia achieve its claim to West Irian, and is Indonesia willing to accept international arbitration on this issue?

Answer: Indonesia has repeatedly attempted to resolve this issue through bilateral talks with the Netherlands. After the Dutch government refused to continue talks, Indonesia appealed to the United Nations for assistance in holding talks between the Netherlands and Indonesia, but the proposal to do so failed to gain a two-thirds majority in the United Nations General Assembly.

The approach Indonesia is currently taking is to resolve all its issues with the Netherlands, including the West Irian issue, outside the United Nations.

This means that the relationship between Indonesia and the Netherlands cannot remain as it is.

On the one hand, the Netherlands is pursuing a policy against Indonesia (which is not limited to the West Irian issue), and on the other hand, the Netherlands hopes to preserve its economic interests and maintain its favorable trade relations with Indonesia.

This contradiction cannot continue forever.

If the Netherlands believes that its economic and trade relations with Indonesia are worth preserving and improving, then I think the Netherlands should also do something to win friendship in Indonesia.

Question: The London "Daily Telegraph" said: "Indonesia is heading directly towards a completely communist regime openly dependent on China and Russia." Would you like to comment on this?

Answer: I am reluctant to comment on such a statement made by the "Daily Telegraph" because, in my opinion, some people are very fond of accusing a country or its people of being communist if their views on political or economic issues do not coincide with those of the West.

Indonesia was one of the last countries to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Its trade with China or the Soviet Union is small compared to the trade conducted by many Western European countries. Moreover, even compared to other Asian countries, Indonesia's trade with Russia or China is small.

But, apart from that, I should issue a firm warning to these people: it would not be wise to attribute anything that happens in Asia that deviates from Western ideas to communism or communist influence. After all, Asian problems cannot be solved by Western methods.

The development of political and economic stability in many Asian countries depends on whether their leaders can find the right way to develop their politics and economy in a certain period. In different stages of world development and under different circumstances, maturity, prosperity, and stability must be pursued in different ways.

What I worry about is: if every nation and every country is treated as an enemy mainly because you disagree with them, then soon you will be isolated from the majority of the world and the majority of mankind.

Question: To whom does the requirement to repatriate Dutch residents apply? What is the timetable for repatriation? What measures are currently being taken to avoid undue suffering?

Answer: The government's policy is that Dutch nationals without employment (approximately nine thousand people) should gradually leave Indonesia. So far, the Indonesian government has never issued an expulsion order, and anyone who wishes to leave will receive the fullest cooperation from the government.

On the other hand, Dutch nationals who have any important profession and wish to stay in Indonesia will not be denied a residence permit.

The government is currently taking care to ensure that no one suffers undue hardship during the repatriation process. On the other hand, eight hundred to one thousand Indonesians are stranded in Singapore due to the boycott by the Royal Dutch Shipping Company, and they have not received the same treatment from the Dutch authorities.

Question: How will Dutch property and investments in Indonesia be handled? Are there plans to nationalize them?

Answer: All Dutch property and investments are currently under the control and supervision of the government to ensure the smooth operation of economic enterprises.

The solution to this issue will be part of the overall solution to the dispute between the Netherlands and Indonesia (including the West Irian issue).

Question: Are there plans to repatriate other foreign nationals or expropriate their property?

Answer: The government does not plan to take any measures against other foreign nationals, foreign property, or foreign enterprises.

Question: Does Indonesia want to obtain loans or technical assistance from the governments of other countries to develop and utilize its resources?

Answer: Indonesia continues to maintain its original policy of seeking to obtain loans and technical assistance from other countries to develop and utilize its resources. (Attached picture)

    苏加诺总统答合众社记者问
    印度尼西亚决心解放西伊里安
    要在联合国外解决与荷兰之间全部问题
    新华社30日讯　据合众社报道，印度尼西亚总统苏加诺在29日以书面答复合众社驻雅加达记者提出的问题，阐述了印度尼西亚在收复西伊里安的斗争中的立场。
    合众社的问题和苏加诺总统的答复如下：
    问：印度尼西亚对西伊里安提出的要求所根据的政治理由和历史理由是什么？
    答：印度尼西亚对西伊里安的要求和权利所根据的政治理由和历史理由，而且，我还可以说，甚至还有法律理由，都已经由印度尼西亚代表团在联合国就西伊里安问题所进行的辩论中说明过好几次了。
    我可以再一次简短地说一下：在政治方面和历史方面的理由在于：西伊里安是过去被称为荷属东印度群岛的印度尼西亚的政治实体的一个重要部分；
    还在于：印度尼西亚（包括西伊里安）人民许多世纪以来就都是团结在一起的，这不仅是由于荷兰的统治，而且还是由于他们的历史，由于他们为了争取民族生存和最终获得自由而进行的共同斗争；
    还在于：印度尼西亚人民在1945年8月17日宣布全印度尼西亚独立，随后又为了巩固这种独立而进行了斗争；
    还在于：荷兰在正式的协定和在联合国所提出的郑重的保证中曾经答应要促进在1949年建立完全的主权，荷兰政府应该正式把对印度尼西亚的完全的不可改变的主权移交过来从而承认印度尼西亚国家的独立。
    从来没有达成过任何一种协议规定把西伊里安州列在独立而有主权的印度尼西亚国家的版图以外。
    除此以外，西伊里安也被认为是争取独立的斗争的受难地，因为著名的领导人大多数都曾经在西伊里安的臭名远扬的波文迪古营里以被流放者或者被监禁者的身分度过好多年。
    这种具有象征意义的解释大大加强了解放西伊里安的决心。
    问：同样的考虑是否也适用于新几内亚的其余部分呢？
    答：既然东新几内亚并不是荷属东印度群岛和印度尼西亚政治实体的一部分，这种考虑自然不适用于东新几内亚，我们对于东新几内亚根本没有任何要求。
    问：印度尼西亚将要如何实现它对于西伊里安的要求呢，印度尼西亚是否愿意接受在这个问题上所进行的国际仲裁呢？
    答：印度尼西亚曾经好几次设法通过同荷兰进行双边会谈的方法解决这个问题。在荷兰政府拒绝继续进行会谈以后，印度尼西亚就呼吁联合国予以援助，使荷兰和印度尼西亚双方举行会谈，但是主张这样作的提案却没有能够在联合国大会获得三分之二多数的支持。
    印度尼西亚目前所采取的方针是：在联合国以外解决它与荷兰之间的全部问题，包括西伊里安问题在内。
    这也就是说，印度尼西亚和荷兰之间的关系不能够保持现状。
    一方面荷兰是在执行反对印度尼西亚的政策（这也并不只限于西伊里安问题），另一方面荷兰又希望保存他们的经济利益以及保持他们同印度尼西亚的有利的贸易关系。
    这种矛盾是不能够永远继续下去的。
    假如荷兰认为，它在印度尼西亚的经济和贸易关系是值得保存和改善的，那末，我想荷兰同时也应该作一些事情来在印度尼西亚争取友谊。
    问：伦敦“每日电讯报”说：“印度尼西亚正在直接走向一个公开依附中国和俄国的十足共产主义的政权。”你愿意对这一点发表意见吗？
    答：我不大愿意就“每日电讯报”所提出的这样一种说法发表意见，因为在我看来，有些人很喜好指责一个国家或者它的人民为共产党，假如他们在政治或者经济问题上的看法同西方的看法不一致的话。
    印度尼西亚是同苏联建立外交关系最迟的国家之一。它同中国或者苏联的贸易往来，假如同许多西欧国家所进行的贸易比较起来，是很少的。而且，即使是同其他亚洲国家比较起来，印度尼西亚在同俄国或者中国进行贸易的数量方面还是少的。
    但是，撇开这一点，我应该向这些人提出一点坚定的警告：如果把亚洲所发生的脱离西方的想法的任何事情都归之于共产主义或是共产主义的影响，那不会是明智的。归根结底，亚洲问题是不能够以西方的办法来解决的。
    亚洲许多国家在政治稳定和经济稳定方面的发展，取决于它们的领导人是否能够找到在一定时期内发展它们的政治和经济的正确的办法。在世界发展中的不同时期的不同情况下，必须以不同的方式谋求成熟、繁荣和稳定。
    我所担心的是：如果主要是由于同你们有分歧而把每一个民族、每一个国家都当作敌人，那末，不久你们就会脱离全世界的大多数和全人类的大多数而陷于孤立。
    问：关于遣返荷兰居民的要求，究竟适用于哪些人？遣返的时间表如何？目前正在采取什么措施来避免不应有的痛苦？
    答：政府的政策是：没有职业的荷兰国民（大约有九千人）应该逐步离开印度尼西亚。到目前为止，印度尼西亚政府从来没有发布驱逐令，凡是希望走的人，都将会从政府方面获得最充分的合作。
    另一方面，荷兰国民如果有任何一种重要的职业而希望留在印度尼西亚，那末也就不会得不到居住的许可。
    政府目前正在留意使任何人在遣返过程中都不会遭受不应有的痛苦。另一方面，却有八百到一千名印度尼西亚人由于荷兰皇家轮船公司进行抵制而被困在新加坡，他们没有受到荷兰当局的同样的待遇。
    问：关于在印度尼西亚的荷兰财产和投资，将要如何处理？是否计划收归国有？
    答：一切荷兰财产和投资目前都在政府的管制和监督之下，这是为了保证使经济企业顺利经营。
    这个问题的解决将要成为荷兰和印度尼西亚之间的纠纷（包括西伊里安问题在内）的总的解决的一部分。
    问：关于其他外国国民，是否也计划遣返他们或者征用他们的财产？
    答：政府不计划对其他外国国民、外国财产或者外国企业采取任何措施。
    问：印度尼西亚是否想从其他国家的政府获得贷款或者技术援助以开发和利用自己的资源？
    答：印度尼西亚继续保持原有的政策，设法从其他国家获得贷款和技术援助以开发和利用自己的资源。（附图片）
