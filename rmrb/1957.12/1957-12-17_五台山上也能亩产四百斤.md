Four Hundred Jin Per Mu Can Also Be Produced on Mount Wutai
By Wang Xinnian, Director of the Hebei Village Labor Agricultural Cooperative, Wutai County, Shanxi Province

Perhaps some people think this is a strange tale, but it is a true fact:

In the Hebei Village Labor Agricultural Cooperative of Wutai County, which "backs onto rocky mountains, faces the clear water river beach; where it is difficult to expand cultivated land and frequently suffers from floods," the average yield per mu this year reached 401.5 jin. This can't be called anything but a miracle.

This mountain village is home to 304 households, a total of 1,169 people, with 1,580 mu of land, averaging just over 1.3 mu of land per person. In 1955, the village set up four elementary agricultural cooperatives, and, based on the conditions of little land, abundant labor, and available water resources, vigorously carried out basic water conservancy construction. By 1956, the four elementary cooperatives merged and became one advanced cooperative. However, that year, it encountered a major flood unseen in a century, which not only washed away 351 mu of good paddy fields but also destroyed almost all the paddy field canals. In the severe winter of that year, the Party branch and the cooperative management committee mobilized all members to launch a basic construction campaign centered on restoring water conservancy and building a village protection dam. After more than five months of arduous labor, more than 5,000 workdays were invested, a large stone dam was built to protect the village, four major canals were restored, and 24 new branch canals were opened, ensuring that more than 1,000 mu of paddy fields could be irrigated in a timely manner, and turning 600 mu of land irrigated only by clean water into land irrigated by both clean and floodwater, basically realizing water conservancy. This year, although it suffered from a severe drought, production still greatly increased.

Before cooperation, the planting area of ​​yam and corn accounted for about half of the total cultivated land, but they were all local inferior varieties. Even the corn in the paddy fields only yielded about 300 jin per mu. From 1955, the cooperative began to promote Golden Queen corn and superior yam varieties. By 1956, the planting area of ​​these two superior varieties accounted for 68.7% of the total cultivated land, basically realizing the high-yield crop system. This year, the 20 mu of high-yielding corn specially cultivated achieved a yield of 580 jin per mu. In addition, last year, based on local climatic conditions, we experimented with intercropping beans in dryland wheat and yam fields. This year, we intercropped 178 mu, increasing the average yield by 150 jin per mu. However, this is only the beginning in this regard.

As the saying goes: "Careful cultivation and meticulous planting also require fertilizer." Therefore, while expanding water conservancy and promoting superior varieties, we also paid great attention to increasing the application of fertilizer. The main methods for developing fertilizer accumulation are: First, implementing a three-fixed reward system that specifies the quantity, quality, and labor remuneration for fertilizer accumulation each season, as well as over-award and under-deduction. Second, for the night soil fertilizer of the members, the cooperative supplies the soil mat, and the fertilizer price is converted to the members. Third, the implementation of the fertilizer price advance payment method also encouraged the enthusiasm of the members to accumulate fertilizer. Therefore, fertilizer has increased year by year. In 1955, the average application of fertilizer per mu was 36 dan, which increased to 58 dan this year. The cooperative also purchased 38,000 jin of chemical fertilizer and cake fertilizer, expanding topdressing.

Past experience has proven that "two-izations" (water conservancy, high-yield crops) and "one-more" (more fertilizer) are the key to increasing production. In the future, as long as we grasp these three measures, and carry out land leveling on the existing slopes, and adopt water lifting and flood diversion methods to turn the existing 500 mu of dry land into flood-irrigated paddy fields, it is certain that by 1962, achieving the goal of 500 jin per mu is completely within reach.

### 五台山上也能亩产四百斤

　　五台山上也能亩产四百斤
　　山西五台县河北村劳动农业社主任　王新年
    也许有人以为这是奇谈，然而却是千真万确的事实：
    在“背靠石头大山，面临清水河滩；耕地很难扩大，经常遭受水患”的五台县河北村劳动农业社，今年每亩平均产量达到四百零一斤半。这不能不说是一个奇迹。
    这个山庄住着三百零四户人家，共一千一百六十九口人，土地一千五百八十亩，每人平均只有一亩三分多土地。1955年，全村办起了四个初级农业社，根据土地少、人力多和有水利资源的条件，大力进行水利基本建设。到1956年，四个初级社合并转成一个高级社。可是，这一年，遇到了一个百年来未有的大洪灾，不仅把三百五十一亩好水地冲没，而且把水地渠道几乎全部冲毁。当年严冬，党支部和社管理委员会便发动全体社员展开了以恢复水利和修筑护村坝为中心的基本建设运动。经过五个多月的艰苦劳动，投工五千余个，修成一条护村大石坝，恢复了四条大渠，新开了二十四条支渠，保证了一千多亩水地能适时灌溉，使六百亩清浇地变成了清、洪两浇地，基本上实现了水利化。今年，虽然又遭受了严重的旱灾，仍然大大增产。
    合作化前，山药、玉米的种植面积，占总耕地的一半左右，但都是当地劣种，即使水地玉米，每亩也只产三百斤上下。从1955年，合作社开始推广金皇后玉米和优种山药，到1956年，这两项优种作物播种面积，即占到总耕地的68.7％，基本上实现了高产作物化。今年，专门培植的二十亩高额丰产玉米，亩产达到五百八十斤。此外，去年还根据当地气候条件，试验了在旱地小麦和山药地内间种豆子，今年即间种了一百七十八亩，使每亩平均增产了一百五十斤。不过在这方面，还仅仅是开始。
    俗话说：“精耕细种，还得上粪”。因此，在扩大水利和推广优良品种的同时，也十分重视了增施肥料。开展积肥的主要办法是：一、实行按季规定积肥数量、质量和劳动报酬以及超奖、少扣的三定奖励制度。二、对社员的厕所肥，采取垫土由社供给，肥价折归社员。三、实行肥价款预支办法，也鼓舞了社员积肥的积极性。因此，肥料逐年增加，1955年，每亩地平均施肥三十六担，今年即增加为五十八担。社内还购买了化肥、饼肥三万八千斤，扩大了追肥。
    历年经验证明，“两化”（水利化、高产作物化）“一多”（多施肥）是增产的关键。今后，只要抓住这三项措施，再对现有坡地实行平整，采取提水、引洪办法，把现有的五百余亩旱地都变成洪浇水地，可以肯定，到1962年，实现亩产五百斤的指标是完全有把握的。
