The Ministry of Building Materials Industry and Affiliated Cement Design Institute
Hold Employee Representative Conference to Promote Rectification Movement
Leaders and Masses Closely Integrated, Solid Foundation Laid for Solving Problems

(Reported by our newspaper) The Ministry of Building Materials Industry and its affiliated Cement Design Institute have adopted the form of an employee representative conference for centralized airing of views and rectification, enabling close integration between leaders and the masses and promoting the rectification movement.

The employee representative conferences held by the Ministry of Building Materials Industry and the Cement Design Institute focused on a deep airing of views on the main problems existing in the ministry and the institute. Since the Ministry of Building Materials Industry entered the third stage of the rectification movement, although the basic problems have been aired, the airing of views on major issues has been insufficient and of low quality. In order to directly and systematically listen to the opinions of the masses on major issues (that is, opinions on the work of the leadership), the ministry leaders decided to hold an employee representative conference to enable representatives to systematically air their views on major issues from various perspectives.

The ministry's employee representative conference was held continuously for three days from November 14th to 16th. The vast majority of the ninety-two representatives who attended the meeting spoke, raising eighty-eight opinions on issues related to the implementation of national policies (including building the country through diligence and thrift, design work, scientific research, and technical policies); ninety-three opinions on institutions and personnel; and eighty-two opinions on living welfare. Because the representatives had extensively solicited opinions from the masses in their respective units before the meeting and made research preparations, the opinions raised by the representatives were more systematic, specific, and substantial, including not only criticisms but also suggestions. For example, some representatives criticized the irrational distribution of the cement industry, the increasing distance of cement transportation year by year, and the phenomenon of waste, while also proposing three improvement suggestions. Some representatives also put forward specific suggestions for unified arrangements to change the current problem of decentralized design of cement equipment. These systematic criticisms and suggestions are of great help to the ministry's leaders in examining and improving their work.

The employee representative conference also unified the understanding between superiors and subordinates on some important issues. At the employee representative conferences of the ministry and the institute, leaders of the ministry and the institute made special speeches on issues such as organizational structure, policies, work direction, and wages and welfare, which played a positive role in communicating the understanding between superiors and subordinates. During the airing of views, many people put forward opinions on the development direction of the ministry, requesting that it be resolved during the rectification stage. Because this issue involved a wide range, the ministry leaders had conducted research many times, but had not communicated it to all employees. At the employee representative conference, leading cadres gave a special report on the development direction of the ministry, and the representatives also provided information and opinions from various aspects. After the meeting, the representatives went to communicate with the masses separately, so that everyone had a correct understanding of the development direction of the ministry.

During the airing of views, the masses also put forward various opinions on the merger or separation of the two design institutes and two research institutes under the Ministry of Building Materials Industry. After research, the ministry leaders formulated a preliminary plan, but because they had not fully understood the situation and opinions of each institute, they had not finalized it. At the employee representative conference held by the ministry, the leaders analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of the merger and separation in detail, and the representatives conducted a full discussion, so that the plan was largely finalized after modification. After the meeting, the representatives conveyed the process of determining this plan to the masses, so that the divergent opinions reached a consensus.

While making suggestions to the leaders, the conference also enabled the exchange of opinions between various units. For example, at the employee representative conference of the ministry, some representatives criticized the bureaucracy of the ministry leaders on issues such as exploration work and labor protection, and also pointed out the responsibilities that the Geological Bureau and the Safety Technology Department should bear in these aspects, and exchanged opinions. In this way, finding out the causes of the problems from all aspects will facilitate future rectification work.

The Ministry of Building Materials Industry, especially the Cement Design Institute, also used the employee representative conference to vigorously carry out rectification. The rectification professional group of the Cement Design Institute reported to the representatives at the meeting on the first batch of rectification progress in production and business, political work, and living welfare, explaining the rectification situation and reasons. The representatives discussed the rectification report, conveyed it to the masses after the meeting, and solicited opinions from the masses. This repeated discussion and research made the rectification work both meet the needs of the masses and comply with the principles. For example, the masses raised in the airing of views that the club's movie ticket prices were high and requested a reduction. The rectification group accepted the opinions of the masses and decided to adjust the ticket prices, but some of the masses still had opinions and requested free admission. The rectification group reported to the representatives at the employee representative conference the accounting situation of the movie ticket price collection, and the representatives, after discussion, believed that the current ticket price was reasonable and that free admission would be detrimental to the country and should not be done. After the meeting, the representatives further conveyed and explained to the masses, and also obtained their consent. At the meeting, some representatives also criticized the egalitarianism of some people in the masses.

The employee representative conference of the Cement Design Institute has been held three times on November 27th, December 3rd, and 5th, and is preparing to continue to hold it, vigorously carrying out rectification through this conference form.

### 建筑材料工业部和所属水泥设计院  召开职工代表会议推动了整风运动  领导和群众紧密结合起来　解决问题有了稳固的基础

    建筑材料工业部和所属水泥设计院
    召开职工代表会议推动了整风运动
    领导和群众紧密结合起来　解决问题有了稳固的基础
    本报讯　建筑材料工业部和所属水泥设计院采取职工代表会议形式进行集中鸣放和整改，使领导和群众紧密结合起来，推动了整风运动。
    建筑材料工业部和水泥设计院召开的职工代表会议集中地对部和院存在的主要问题进行了一次深透的鸣放。建筑材料工业部转入整风第三阶段以来，虽然基本问题都已鸣放出来，但对重大问题鸣放还不够，且质量不高。部领导上为了直接地系统地听取群众在主要问题方面的意见（也就是领导工作方面的意见），决定举行职工代表会议，使代表从各个不同角度对重大问题系统地进行鸣放。
    部的职工代表会议从11月14日到16日连续举行三天。参加会议的九十二名代表绝大部分发了言，对执行国家方针政策方面的问题提出了八十八条意见（其中包括勤俭建国、设计工作、科学研究、技术政策等）；机构、人事方面的意见有九十三条；生活福利方面的意见有八十二条。由于代表在会前曾在本单位广泛征求群众意见，并作过研究准备，因此，代表们所提出的意见都较系统、具体、充实，不仅有批评，而且有建议。如有的代表对目前水泥工业地区分布不合理、水泥运输距离逐年增加和浪费现象提出了批评，同时提出三项改进建议。有的代表对改变目前水泥设备分散设计问题，也提出了具体的统一安排的意见。这些系统性的批评和建议对部领导上检查和改进工作都有很大帮助。
    职工代表会议还统一了上下之间对一些重要问题的认识。部和院的职工代表会议，都有部和院的领导人对组织机构、方针政策、工作方向以及工资福利等问题作了专门发言，这对沟通上下之间的认识起了积极的作用。鸣放期间，很多人对部的发展方向提出意见，要求在整改阶段加以解决。因为这一问题牵涉较广，部领导虽曾多次作过研究，但没有向全体职工进行传达。在职工代表会议上，领导干部对部的发展方向作了专题报告，代表们也提供了各方面的情况和意见，会后，代表又分头向群众进行传达，使大家对部的发展方向有了正确认识。
    在鸣放期间，群众对建筑材料工业部所属的两个设计院和两个研究院的合并或分设问题，也提出各种不同意见。部领导经过研究，制定了初步方案，但因为对各院的情况和意见还没有完全摸透，也没有最后确定下来。在部召开的职工代表会议上，领导上详细地分析了分合的利弊，代表们进行了充分的讨论，使这个方案经过修改之后大体确定下来。会后，代表们把确定这个方案的经过向群众作了传达，使分歧的意见达到统一。
    会议在对领导提出意见的同时，也使各单位之间交换了意见。如在部的职工代表会议上，有的代表就勘探工作和劳动保护方面的问题批评了部领导的官僚主义，同时也指出了地质局、安全技术处在这些方面应负的责任，交换了意见。这样，从各方面找出问题发生的原因，就便于今后的整改工作。
    建筑材料工业部特别是水泥设计院还运用职工代表会议大力进行整改。水泥设计院整改专业小组曾在会上就生产业务、政治工作、生活福利等方面的第一批整改情况，向代表作了报告，说明了整改的情况和理由。代表们对整改报告作了讨论，会后向群众作了传达，并且征求了群众意见。这样反复讨论研究，使整改工作既满足群众要求，又符合原则。如群众在鸣放中提出俱乐部电影票价较高，要求降低。整改小组接受了群众意见，决定对票价进行调整，但一部分群众仍有意见，要求实行免费。整改小组在职工代表会议上向代表报告了电影票价收费核算情况，代表经过讨论，认为目前票价合理，实行免费对国家不利，是不应该的。会后代表们再向群众传达解释，也得到了同意。会上，有的代表在发言中，还对群众中某些人的平均主义思想提出了批评。
    水泥设计院的职工代表会议已经在11月27日、12月3日和5日举行三次，并准备继续举行，通过这种会议形式大力进行整改。
