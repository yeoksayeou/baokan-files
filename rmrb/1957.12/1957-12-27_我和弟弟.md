My Younger Brother
Yu Qian

My younger brother is the youngest among us siblings. He didn't pass the entrance exam for middle school for two years after graduating from primary school. My older brother took him to the Northeast, saying that middle schools were easier to get into there, but he still failed. He wanted to work in a steel factory, but the family wouldn't let him and told him to study for another year and try again. But he resolutely refused to study and went home to farm.

Although my younger brother didn't want to study, he was very fond of handicrafts and did them quite well. He replaced all the wooden lattice windows at home with movable glass windows. He could also mend broken jars and basins. Neighbors would come to him for small jobs, and he earned their praise and my mother's favor.

However, I always thought that continuing his schooling was the right thing to do. This summer vacation, I planned to personally persuade him to continue his education.

As soon as I entered the house, I saw my younger brother facing the mountain wall, writing something in a notebook. When he saw me, he happily closed the notebook and jumped in front of me. "What are you writing?" I asked him. He said shyly, "Nothing!" I curiously walked to the mountain wall and saw that there was a thermometer hanging there. He was recording the temperature changes. I saw five sprayers on the ground and four wooden boards hanging on the wall, neatly filled with books.

After dinner, I asked my mother about my younger brother's situation in recent years. My mother said happily to me: "He's not so simple now. He's a technician in the commune, the director of the library, and also a member of the commune committee."

I had been home for five or six days, and I wanted to find time to have a good chat with my younger brother, but such an opportunity was hard to come by. During the day, he was busy working in the fields, and we had no time to chat. Although we ate together, it was only for a short time, and after dinner, we went our separate ways. In the evening, my younger brother would put down his rice bowl and go out, and I would be asleep by the time he came back. One day, we were irrigating the land when it started to rain lightly, so we stopped working and went home. I wanted to take this opportunity to talk to my younger brother. I went into his room and found that he was not there. I asked my mother, and she told me that he and a group of people had gone to the east of the river to compost green manure.

One evening, it was hot and stuffy. My younger brother was huddled under the kerosene lamp, looking intently at his notes with a serious face, flipping through books from time to time. I thought to myself: "What's this? My younger brother is using his head tonight. Could it be that he's been influenced by me and wants to study hard on his own?" I happily walked up to him and asked him, "What are you looking at?" He was startled and said, "I'm checking methods for treating corn borers. The corn is infested with corn borers, and using wettable 666 powder to irrigate it isn't effective." After a moment, he suddenly asked me as if he had found salvation: "Second Brother, do you think we dare use 1605 (note)?" This sudden question made me flustered. I didn't know anything about it. But I didn't want to admit that I didn't understand, so I irresponsibly said, "You can use it if it's effective." "But 1605 is too toxic. One drop can kill thirty-two people! I don't dare to use it," my younger brother said worriedly. "Just be careful and it'll be fine," I insisted. My younger brother looked at me as if he had received an enlightenment, and while putting away his notebook and books, he said, "I'll go ask the technical station tomorrow."

Before going to bed, I asked him where he went every night and why he came back so late. My younger brother smiled and replied shyly, "I'm giving agricultural technology classes to the junior middle school class for farmers. I'm not very good at it."

The next day at noon, my younger brother told me, "The comrades at the technical station said that 1605 cannot be used. 666 is the most effective. The concentration we mixed was a bit weak, and we didn't irrigate enough, so it wasn't very effective." Hearing this, my face flushed. I thought to myself: "What if he had listened to me and used 1605, and something had happened?"

This was an extraordinary vacation, and my younger brother gave me a vivid political lesson. Before leaving, my younger brother took me to the train station. I shook my younger brother's hand warmly, wanting to say something, but my throat seemed to be blocked. The train was about to leave. I suddenly remembered something and said to my younger brother, "Third Brother, after I get to Beijing, I'll assemble a crystal radio for you so you can hear the voice of the capital." The train slowly started moving, and my younger brother waved his hand and shouted, "No need! Our commune will be installing a broadcast next year!"

(Note) "1605" is a highly toxic insecticide.

    我和弟弟
    于潜
    弟弟是我们弟兄中最小的一个，他高小毕业后，两年都没有考上中学。哥哥把他领到东北，说那里的中学好考，可是他又没有考上。他想到钢铁厂去当工人，家里不让他去，让他复习一年再考。但他却坚决不读书了，回家种庄稼。
    弟弟虽不愿念书，但对手艺活却十分喜欢，做的还满精细。家里的木条窗栊，他都给换上活动的玻璃窗。缸呀，盆呀破了，他也能补起来。街坊邻居有些小活计也都来找他干。因而也讨得了邻人的夸奖和妈妈的喜欢。
    可是，我总是认为他该继续上学校才是正事。今年暑假回家，我打算要亲自劝劝他，让他继续上学。
    刚进了家门，便看到弟弟面对着山墙拿着个本子在写什么。他看见是我，高兴地把本子合上跳到我的面前。“你在写什么？”我问他。他靦覥地说：“没写什么！”我好奇地走到山墙前一看，噢！这里挂着一只温度表，他这是在记录温度的变化。看见地上放着五个喷雾器。吊在墙上的四块木板上，整整齐齐地摆满了书。
    吃完饭，我问起弟弟这几年的情况。妈妈愉快地对我说：“人家现在不简单了，是社里的技术员，图书馆的主任，还是社里的委员哩。”
    回家五、六天了，我想找个时间好好和弟弟聊聊，可是这样的机会实在难得。白天下地干活，没功夫闲聊，吃饭虽在一起，但时间很短，吃完了饭就各走各的。晚上，弟弟又是推下饭碗就出去，等他回来的时候我已熟睡了。有一天我们正在浇地，天蒙蒙地下起雨来，我们收工回了家。我想趁此机会找弟弟谈谈。进他的屋一看，弟弟不在了。一问妈妈，才知道他们一伙人去河东地沤绿肥去了。
    一天晚上，又热又闷，弟弟凑在煤油灯下，低沉着脸，精力集中地在看笔记，一会儿又翻翻书。我心想：“怎么，弟弟今晚上用起功来了，莫非是受我的影响，也要好好自学了。”我愉快地走到他跟前，问他：“看什么？”他楞了一下，说：“查查治钻心虫的方法。现在苞米生了钻心虫，用可湿性的666粉，灌了不见效。”停了片刻，他突然像得救似地问我：“二哥，你说，敢不敢用1605（注）。”这突如其来的问题使我很着慌。我一窍也不通。可是又不愿说不懂，于是便不负责任的说：“效力大就可以用。”“可是1605毒性太大，一滴就能毒死三十二个人！不敢用。”弟弟顾虑地说。“只要谨慎点就不要紧。”我坚持地说。弟弟像得到了启示似的，望了望我，一面收拾本子和书，一面说：“明天我去技术站问问。”
    临睡前，我问他每天晚上到那里去耍，到那样晚才回来。弟弟笑了一笑，不好意思地回答说：“给民校初中班讲农业技术课。咱也讲不好。”
    第二天中午，弟弟对我讲：“技术站的同志说，1605不能用。666最有效。咱们配的有点稀，灌的太少，所以效力不大。”听了这话，我的脸刷地红了。心想：“要是他听了我的话，用了1605，发生了问题怎么办？”
    这是一个不平凡的假期，弟弟给我上了生动的一堂政治课。临走，弟弟把我送到车站，我亲切地握着弟弟的手，想说句什么，可是嗓子像被什么给塞住了。车要开了。我突然想起来，对弟弟说：“三弟，到北京以后，我给你装一架矿石收音机，让你也能听到首都的声音。”车徐徐地开动了，弟弟摆着手喊：“不用啊！明年咱社里就要安广播了！”
    （注）“1605”是一种有巨毒的杀虫农药。
