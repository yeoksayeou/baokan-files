　　"All Men Are Brothers Within the Four Seas"
　　Li Shaobai
　　A French fishing boat, two days away from a Norwegian seaport, suddenly had a person on board who fell seriously ill. Through amateur radio contact, a doctor determined it was a case of food poisoning. An injection of serum was necessary within twelve hours to avoid danger. However, there was no serum on board. Thus, a struggle to save the lives of the eleven people on board began...
　　To fight for human life is a solemn theme. We have seen many excellent films on this subject, such as the Hungarian "For Fourteen Lives" and the Egyptian "Life and Death." However, the ideas revealed in these films on the same subject are not all the same. "All Men Are Brothers Within the Four Seas" expresses a great and lofty theme: the theme of peace, the theme of international friendship and cooperation. The film's author passionately describes how those kind people, regardless of country, race, political belief, or social status, carried out close unity, cooperation, and struggle to save the lives of a boatload of people! It proves that for the sake of peace, to prevent war, and to save more people from death, countries should be friendly, united, and coexist peacefully. Peace, give the world peace – this is the increasingly loud and powerful voice of people all over the world. The author expressed the people's voice, and therefore it can win the most sincere and enthusiastic welcome from people of all countries.
　　The French film "All Men Are Brothers Within the Four Seas" is not only lofty in thought but also beautiful in form. With outstanding artistic talent, the author vividly and persuasively depicts the world's people's desire for peace.
　　This is a vast subject: many characters – more than a dozen main characters, many events – people did a great deal of work to save the lives of these sailors; a large space – including several countries. If the author does not handle such a large subject well, it is easy to fall into chaos, unclear lines, or become a thrilling film that only hurriedly narrates events. However, the author's ingenious plot design and rigorous structural handling not only avoided these shortcomings but also maintained an extremely fresh and clear style.
　　The film can be divided into two major plot lines: one is the plot line on the fishing boat, which unfolds with the conflict between Zass and the Arab caused by food poisoning; the other is the plot line that takes place on land to save the lives of the fishermen, which unfolds with the conflict of trying to get the serum to the fishing boat within twelve hours. The author skillfully twists these two lines together through montage. The story begins on the boat, then turns to the land, and then the two intertwine. On the one hand, it shows the struggle of those kind people to save the lives of others; on the other hand, it also shows the impending fate of those on the boat. On shore, from Togo, Paris, to Berlin..., the serum gets closer and closer to the fishing boat; while on the boat, two are sick, four are sick, and finally only two are left... Life gets closer and closer to danger! In this way, the film grabs the audience's heart step by step, making the audience more and more anxious, more and more worried, and more and more suspenseful about the lives of those sailors. However, even in this case, as mentioned earlier, the author did not treat the work as a thriller. On the contrary, what the author strives for is the plausibility and lifelikeness of the plot. Why did the author spend a certain amount of film shooting the scene of that merchant from Togo swatting mosquitoes? Why write that his radio antenna is too short and needs to be repaired? Why write about the deep pain of the woman whose husband died? Why write that when the young man goes to send a telegram, he also takes the young man who went to see the boxing match with him, and then describes the young man waiting impatiently downstairs? An important reason is that life is detailed and concrete, so the author also tries to make the lives of the characters in the play more detailed, concrete, and complex. These descriptions in the film are undoubtedly effective, making the plot of the work as real and believable as if it happened in real life. At the same time, the author's arrangement of the plot is also very natural. In life, it is often like this, sometimes smooth, sometimes unlucky. Take taking a bus, for example, sometimes as soon as you arrive at the station, a bus arrives, as if it were prepared especially for you; while sometimes you need to wait for more than ten minutes. The author also arranges the plot in this way, for example: the young man quickly found the doctor's house, and the blind man quickly found an American through his daughter... But sometimes it is very difficult. The medicine box ultimately failed to catch the plane to Munich, the woman whose husband died, and the blind man himself never got through to Berlin on the phone... The occurrence and end of all these things are so natural. Here, we must mention the plot of the blind man's daughter and her lover. The author handles this plot very movingly, which is not only necessary for the lifelikeness of the film's plot but also helps to strengthen the rhythm of the film. The father asks his daughter to find an American who has acquaintances in Berlin in the hospital where she works. And this American – her lover, has already arrived. But in order to explain that she just went to find him, she leisurely spends fifteen minutes with her lover outside. This plot is slow on the surface, but in reality, it is tense. "Saving lives is like fighting fire," allowing no delay. Through the contrast between urgency and slowness, and the wonderful stroke of using slowness to set off urgency, the author further promotes the audience's eagerness, which is a very superb stroke.
　　Generally speaking, it is not easy to portray vivid, concrete, and unforgettable character images in such a vast subject. What is commendable is that all the characters that appear in this film are distinct personalities. The film's director once said that in this film, he "wants to show that everyone has a kind heart." We say he did it. In my opinion, the most vivid of these people is Zass. This image is portrayed vividly, concretely, and with a distinct personality. He has been poisoned by racism, he attributes the root cause of all the unlucky things to the arrival of an Arab black man on the boat, so he makes trouble for that black man everywhere. Even the ham he brought was poisonous, and he blamed it on the black man. He beat the black man. He is reckless, he doesn't believe that anyone will come to save them, and after the captain is poisoned and passes out, he starts the boat without authorization. He is confident and strong, he says to the young sailor Benzhi: "You will definitely be able to go back, don't worry, we sailors are tough guys, we won't die." But when he faces the radio to speak, he is so helpless and cannot answer. These are very vivid personality descriptions. In the end, he changed, the black man's brave and selfless behavior moved him, so that he and the black man formed a close friendship, when that black man jumped into the sea to salvage that package of serum, he started the boat so anxiously. This image undoubtedly has profound significance for those who have been poisoned by racial discrimination and nationalism. The black man, the author does not use much ink, but is also very vivid, is a kind, brave, and selfless image who can give everything for others. The author's characteristic of portraying characters is to be good at "adding the finishing touch," like an ink painter, who can outline an image in a few strokes, highlighting its characteristics. The woman whose husband died, the blind man, etc., are all highlighted with such strokes.
　　Here, we enthusiastically recommend "All Men Are Brothers Within the Four Seas" to the audience, because it is a very excellent film, which expresses lofty ideas with superb art, and shouts out the voice from the bottom of the hearts of people all over the world: "Long live peace and friendship!"

　　“四海之内皆兄弟”
　　李少白
    一艘法国渔船，在离挪威海港还有两天航程的海面上，船上突然有人患了急病。通过业余无线电的联系，由医生查明是一种食物中毒。十二小时内必须注射血清，方能免除危险。但是船上没有血清。于是，一场为拯救这只船上的十一个人的生命的斗争开始了……
    为人的生命而斗争，这是一个庄严的题材。关于这方面题材的优秀影片，我们看过不少，匈牙利的“为了十四条生命”，埃及的“生与死”，都是。但是这些相同题材的影片所揭示的思想，却不都是相同的。而“四海之内皆兄弟”则表现了一个伟大而崇高的主题：和平的主题，国际友谊与合作的主题。影片作者热情洋溢地描写了那些善良的人们为拯救一船人的生命，怎样不分国度、种族、政治信仰、社会地位，实行了亲密无间的团结、合作和斗争！它证明：为了和平，为了防止战争，使更多的人免于死亡，各国之间应该友好团结，和平共处。和平，给世界以和平——这是全世界人民越来越响亮、越来越有力的心声。作者表达了人民的这种心声，因而它能赢得各国人民最真诚、最热情的欢迎。
    法国影片“四海之内皆兄弟”不仅思想是崇高的，而且形式是优美的。作者以优异的艺术才华，把世界人民的和平的愿望，描写得如此生动，有说服力。
    这是一个庞大的题材：人物多——主要的人物就有十几个，事件多——人们为拯救这船人的生命做了许许多多的工作；空间大——包括了好几个国家。这样庞大的题材如果作者处理得不好，很容易陷入杂乱、脉络不清，或者变成一部只匆匆叙述事件的惊险影片。但是，作者精巧的情节设计和严整的结构处理，不但避免了这些缺点，而且保持着极其清新明朗的风格。
    影片可以分做两条大的情节线索，一条是渔船上的情节线索，这条线索，以由食物中毒引起的扎斯和那个阿拉伯人的冲突开展着；一条是发生在陆地上为拯救渔民的生命而斗争的情节线索，这条线索以争取十二小时之内将血清送到渔船上的冲突开展着。作者将这两条线索，通过蒙太奇手段，巧妙地拧在一起。故事由船上开始，然后转入地上，以后两者交错进行。一方面，展示了那些善良的人为了拯救别人的生命所作的斗争；一方面，也展示了那些船上的人即将来临的命运。岸上，由多哥、巴黎而柏林……，血清一次一次地更接近渔船；而船上，二个病了，四个病了，最后只剩下两个了……生命，一次一次地更接近危急！这样，影片一步紧一步地吸住了观众的心，使观众越来越焦虑，越来越着急，愈来愈悬念着那些水手们的生命。然而即使是在这种情况下，如前所说，作者也并没有把作品处理成为一个惊险故事。相反的，作者所竭力以求的是情节的合乎常情和生活化。作者为什么要花费一定的胶片拍下多哥那个商人打蚊子的镜头呢？为什么要写他的无线电的天线太短，需要修理呢？为什么要写那个死去丈夫的妇女的深沉的痛苦呢？为什么要写那个小伙子去送电报时，还要带上那个与他去看拳斗的年轻人，而又描写那个年轻人在楼下等候得不耐烦呢？一个重要的原因，就是生活是细致而具体的，因此作者也力图使剧中人物的生活细致些、具体些、复杂些。影片的这些描写无疑是有效果的，它使作品的情节像发生在真实生活中一样的真实、可信。同时，作者对情节的安排上，也十分自然。在生活中往往是这样的，有时顺利，有时倒霉。拿坐公共汽车来说吧，有时你一到站，就有车开来，好像是专为你预备的；而有时你又需要等上十几分钟。作者也是这样来安排情节的，比如：那个小伙子很快地找到了那个医生的家、那个双目失明的人托自己的女儿也很快地找着一个美国人……但是，有时又很困难。那只药箱终究没能赶上那班去慕尼黑的飞机，那个死去丈夫的妇女，那个双目失明的人自己始终没有打通给柏林的电话……这一切事情的发生和结束，都是如此的自然。这里不能不提一下那位瞎子的女儿与她的情人的那个情节。这个情节，作者处理得非常动人，这不仅是影片情节的生活化所要有的，同时也有助于加强影片的节奏。父亲叫女儿在她工作的医院里找一个在柏林能有熟人的美国人。而这位美国人——她的情人，早已来了。但是她为了说明是才去找来的，而与她的情人在屋外悠闲地消磨着十五分钟的时间。这个情节，表面上是缓慢的，但实际却是紧张的。“救命如救火”，不容一点耽搁。作者通过急缓对比，以缓衬急的妙笔，更推进了观众的急切心情，是十分精湛的一笔。
    一般地说，这样庞大的题材，是不容易刻划出生动具体、令人难忘的人物形象的。难能可贵的是，在这部影片里出现的都是个性鲜明的人物。影片导演曾说过，在这部影片里，他“要表现在每一个人身上都有着一颗善良的心”。我们说他做到了。我以为，这些人当中最生动的一个是扎斯。这个形象刻划得生动、具体、个性鲜明。他受了种族主义的毒害，他把产生一切不吉利事的根源都归咎于船上来了一个阿拉伯黑人，因而他处处找那个黑人的麻烦。甚至他带来的火腿有了毒，他也怪是那个黑人干的。他毒打那个黑人。他卤莽，他不相信有人会来救他们，在船长中毒昏过去之后，他擅自开动了船。他自信、刚强，他对小水手奔支说：“你一定能回去的，放心吧，咱们水手都是硬汉子，死不了。”但是，当他面对着无线电讲话时，他又是那样的束手无策，答不上话。这些，都是很生动的个性描写。最后他转变了，那个黑人的勇敢而无私的行为感动了他，使他和那个黑人结成了亲密的友谊，当那个黑人跳下海去打捞那包血清的时候，他那么焦急地开动了船。这个形象，对于那些受种族歧视和民族主义毒害的人无疑是有深刻的意义。那个黑人，作者着墨不多，但也非常生动，是一个善良、勇敢、为他人自己可以付出一切的忘我的形象。作者刻划人物的特点，是善于“画龙点睛”，像是一个水墨画家，几笔就能勾画出一个形象，突出其特征。死去了丈夫的女人，瞎眼的人等，都是用这样的笔触突现出来的。
    在这里，我们热情地把“四海之内皆兄弟”推荐给观众，因为它是一部非常优秀的影片，它以精湛的艺术表达了崇高的思想，喊出了全世界人民心底的呼声：“和平与友谊万岁！”
