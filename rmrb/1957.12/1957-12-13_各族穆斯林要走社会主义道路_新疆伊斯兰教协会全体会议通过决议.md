Muslims of All Nationalities Should Take the Socialist Road
Xinjiang Islamic Association Plenary Session Passes Resolution

Our newspaper, Urumqi, 10th dispatch: The second plenary session of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Islamic Association, lasting seven days, concluded on December 4th.

Religious figures at the meeting, after discussion, believed that under the care and education of the Party and the government in recent years, the socialist consciousness of many people in the religious community in the autonomous region has significantly improved, and in practice, they have also expressed their determination to follow the Communist Party on the socialist road. However, there are still a few people who place personal interests and religious interests above the state, and some even engage in anti-communist and anti-socialist activities under the cloak of religion. They sabotage agricultural collectivization, incite the masses to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, and undermine national unity and the unification of the motherland. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution calling on Muslims of all nationalities to resolutely support the leadership of the Party, take the socialist road, accept socialist education, abide by the Party and government's policies and laws, actively participate in the current upsurge of socialist education and production construction, and resolutely struggle against all words and deeds that are unfavorable to the people and to socialism, as well as anti-communist and anti-socialist elements who, under the guise of religion, undermine national unity and the unification of the motherland.

On the closing day, Lü Jianren, Secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, delivered a speech at the meeting. He called on all religious figures to draw a clear line between socialism and capitalism politically and ideologically, resolutely take the socialist road, continuously expand the progressive forces in the religious community, isolate and disintegrate a small number of anti-communist and anti-socialist elements, and mobilize Muslims of all nationalities to actively participate in the upsurge of socialist education and the upsurge of production construction.

　　各族穆斯林要走社会主义道路
    新疆伊斯兰教协会全体会议通过决议
    本报乌鲁木齐10日电　新疆维吾尔自治区伊斯兰教协会第二次全体委员会议，历时七天，于12月4日闭幕。
    会议的宗教界人士经过讨论，认为自治区宗教界几年来在党和政府的关怀教育下，很多人的社会主义觉悟有了显著的提高，在实际中也表示了跟共产党走社会主义道路的决心；但是还有少数人把个人利益、宗教利益放在国家之上，甚至还有人披着宗教外衣进行反共反社会主义的活动。他们破坏农业合作化，煽动群众反对共产党的领导，破坏民族团结和祖国的统一。会议一致通过决议，号召各族穆斯林坚决拥护党的领导，走社会主义道路，接受社会主义教育，遵守党和政府的各项政策法令，积极投入当前社会主义教育和生产建设的高潮中去，并向一切不利于人民，不利于社会主义言论和活动，以及披着宗教外衣，破坏民族团结和祖国统一的反共、反社会主义分子作坚决斗争。
    在闭幕的那一天，自治区党委书记吕剑人在会上讲了话，他号召全体宗教界人士从政治上和思想上划清社会主义和资本主义的界限，坚决走社会主义道路，不断扩大宗教界的进步力量，孤立和分化少数反共、反社会主义的分子，动员各族穆斯林积极投入社会主义教育高潮和生产建设高潮中去。
