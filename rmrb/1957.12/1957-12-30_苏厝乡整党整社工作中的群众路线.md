The experience of the Qunxing Agricultural Cooperative in Su厝 Township, Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, demonstrates that the key to successful Party rectification and commune consolidation lies in fully mobilizing the masses and continuing to engage in vigorous airing of views, big debates, and large-scale criticisms. At the same time, it is essential to address practical issues promptly and improve the style of Party members and cadres in accordance with the principle of "rectifying while correcting." Only in this way can we further strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses, promote the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives, and improve production.

    **The Masses Demand Vigorous Rectification and Improvement**

In the previous period of the socialist debate, Su厝 Township, in response to the demands of the masses, improved pressing issues related to cadre style and cooperative management. The results of rectifying while correcting encouraged the airing of views, promoted production, and reduced the contradictions between cadres and the masses.

However, the improvement of cadre style during the great debate was only the beginning of rectification and improvement. Generally, it did not involve the specific problems of individual cadres. The masses mostly did not thoroughly express their views on the style of Party members and cadres. At the same time, many major problems within the cooperative were not effectively resolved, and the masses urgently demanded their resolution. Therefore, after the great debate, it is necessary to focus on a thorough rectification and improvement based on the increased awareness of the masses.

    **Starting with Commune Consolidation to Improve All Aspects of Work**

Judging from the opinions raised by the masses during the great debate, issues such as cadre style, ideological problems, and economic problems are concentrated in the problems of the cooperative, and the problems of the cooperative are reflected in the Party. At the same time, what the masses urgently demand is the timely resolution of the existing problems in the cooperative, especially the financial cleanup. Therefore, to rectify the style of Party members and cadres, we should first start with commune consolidation, and commune consolidation should start with financial cleanup.

In commune consolidation, the following key issues should be addressed:

First, clean up and publicize finances. The financial situation of Qunxing Cooperative was characterized by uncleared "three-generation accounts" (mutual aid teams, elementary cooperatives, advanced cooperatives) and unsettled "three-layer accounts" (cooperative, brigade, team). The members said this was a "tangled mess" and urgently demanded a cleanup. The key to cleaning up finances is to follow the mass line, not to close the door and check the accounts. At first, some cadres with unclean hands feared that their problems would be exposed and attempted to obstruct the process. Some cadres also saw the confusion of the accounts and lacked confidence, fearing that they would be wrongly accused if they could not figure things out. However, the masses had great determination and strong confidence. They said, "Every transaction has its source, every movement has its path. It's easy to hide wrongdoing from one person, but hard to hide it from everyone. Eventually, everything can be clarified." Therefore, the cooperative announced detailed accounts of all income and expenditure to the members, who checked their own accounts with the cooperative item by item. Specialized representatives were selected to examine every account and every invoice of the cooperative and teams in detail. The problems found were discussed and resolved at a meeting of members' accounting representatives. Because the cooperative resolutely relied on the masses, it finally clarified this "tangled mess." A total of 32 people were found to have engaged in embezzlement and misappropriation, involving more than 1,400 yuan. More than 200 kinds of accounts were cleaned up and rectified.

Second, implement mutually beneficial policies, and change and adjust the organization of cooperatives and teams. This is also the most urgent requirement of the cooperative cadres and members. The Qunxing Cooperative is composed of five natural villages. The cooperative is large and has many members. Everything can only be carried out after the cooperative decides. The leadership cannot be timely. In addition, the sideline businesses of each brigade are different in quantity, and the land is different in quality. It is not easy for the members to understand the economic situation of the entire cooperative, and they all call it a loss, distrusting each other, so they urgently demand the division of the cooperative. Therefore, in order to benefit production and give full play to the superiority of the cooperative, it was decided to change and adjust the organization of the cooperative and teams, and adopt a joint cooperative form, with each brigade responsible for its own profits and losses economically.

Third, grasp the key to increasing production and correctly solve the consistency problem of being responsible to the higher authorities and being responsible to the lower authorities. In the past, in leading production, two biases were often made: one was to only be responsible to the higher authorities, not to be based on the actual situation, and to enforce the tasks of the higher authorities rigidly, committing subjectivism and commandism; the other was to accommodate the opinions of the masses, not to resolutely implement the tasks of the higher authorities, committing tailism. For example, raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer is one of the important keys to increasing production and income. In the past, the higher authorities also arranged to expand the winter planting area and increase the number of pigs raised, but because the higher authorities required all winter planting land to be planted with wheat, we only wanted to complete the winter planting task, and did not dare to propose planting some pig vegetables appropriately, or to propose effective measures to solve the feed problem. Therefore, the pig raising problem actually only stayed on the verbal level. This is a difficult problem for the working group and the Party branch in leading production. This time, the situation was reported to the leadership, and a meeting of old farmers was held to study it. After accounting, the leadership agreed to do so. The whole cooperative used 100 mu of land to plant pig vegetables, which can increase the number of live pigs by 600, which not only completed the winter planting task, but also guaranteed the feed needs for raising pigs. Finally, the problem was brought to the masses for discussion. The masses thought this method was very good and immediately took action.

Fourth, improve the work related to the lives of the masses. In the big airing of views, big debates, and rectification and improvement, the masses have put forward many opinions on various economic enterprises. We have all conveyed them to the relevant departments, and some units have already improved.

    **Combining Internal and External Factors, Open Door Rectification**

After the commune consolidation, the next question is how to win the masses to help the Party's rectification. Therefore, another airing of views, focusing on putting forward opinions to Party members and cadres, is completely necessary. Only by letting the masses put forward all the opinions can the cadres fully recognize their own shortcomings.

However, at that time, some comrades in the working group and the Party branch committee did not realize the importance of open-door rectification and had right-leaning thoughts. They underestimated the power of the masses and the leadership of the Party, and held a conciliatory attitude towards some Party members with serious shortcomings, fearing that the masses would put forward excessive opinions and the cadres would lie down and stop working; they thought that the rural situation was complicated, and would further airing of views cause chaos and isolate the cadres. Among the Party members and cadres, new worries also arose, fearing that the criticism of the masses would cause chaos, the cadres would have no prestige, and it would be difficult to work in the future. So they wanted to close the door for rectification as in the past. They said, "In the past, it was solved internally, now we call the masses to participate, and the masses know everything."

In view of these concerns, the leadership has always paid attention to ideological education from beginning to end. They repeatedly explained the significance of rectification to the cadres, so that they understood that only by fully listening to the opinions of the masses can we fully understand the shortcomings in our work, which is conducive to improving the style of cadres and consolidating the cooperative. At the same time, they made them understand that the cooperative belongs to everyone, the members are the masters of the cooperative, and we must consult with the masses in handling affairs, and accept the supervision of the masses in the movement, listen to the criticisms of the masses, and concentrate the wisdom of the masses, in order to improve ourselves, do a good job, and strengthen the relationship between cadres and the masses. They also explained to the cadres that since the handling of contradictions among the people, most of the opinions put forward by the masses are correct. The masses understand the truth and can distinguish right from wrong. We should resolutely believe in the majority of the masses and not be afraid of chaos.

Facts have proved that most of the opinions put forward by the masses are correct. They put forward a wide range of opinions, including the work style, lifestyle, cadre-mass relationship, illegal and undisciplined activities, corruption, deception and concealment of Party members and cadres, etc. Many things were unknown to the leadership in the past. The criticism of the masses is also very sharp, but well-intentioned. They criticized those Party members who lay down and stopped working, saying, "You are not aware of the good fortune you are in. What kind of Party member are you like this?" They criticized the shortcomings of some cadres, saying, "If you don't change, we will no longer elect you as cadres." Later, the cadres made a profound self-criticism and expressed their determination to correct their mistakes. The masses were very happy and said to the Party members, "In the past, you closed the door for rectification, and we had no place to put forward our opinions. It is very good to do this this time." This attitude of the masses to distinguish right from wrong also profoundly educated all Party members and cadres, so that they truly recognized the power of the masses, and reflected, "The criticism of the masses is like a mirror, which allows me to see my shortcomings." "The criticism of the masses is like a special medicine, which cures the disease."

Among the opinions put forward by the masses, some were rumors among the masses, lacking factual basis, and some were misunderstandings of certain things due to lack of comprehensive understanding. After these opinions were investigated, distinguished right from wrong, and appropriately explained to the masses, everyone was very satisfied. There were also a very small number of people with impure motives who took advantage of the airing of views to carry out activities everywhere, exaggerating the shortcomings of cadres, and attempting to overthrow the original cadres. We put forward these erroneous views in this summary for the masses to discuss. The masses quickly distinguished right from wrong, and gave those people a strong rebuttal, protecting the enthusiasm of the cadres.

    **Rely on Activists to Rectify the Party and the League**

In the great debate and the consolidation of the commune, the style of some Party members has been improved and they have gained the trust of the masses. However, from the perspective of the entire branch, and from the opinions put forward by the masses, the style of the Party members has not been thoroughly rectified, and some problems cannot be solved in the consolidation of the commune and must be put into the Party for resolution. Therefore, it is necessary to allocate a period of time after the consolidation of the commune, and conduct a thorough rectification of the Party's internal affairs in accordance with the Party's organizational principles and the conditions of Party members. At the same time, under the leadership of the Party, the work of rectifying the League is also carried out.

The work of rectifying the Party is carried out by relying on the Party branch and activists. Party members can be roughly divided into five types: 1. Good Party members who have always performed well and are supported by the masses; 2. Those who work actively, have no major problems, and can be transformed through education; 3. Those who have more serious shortcomings or mistakes, and have a tense relationship with the masses, but have basically solved the problem in the consolidation of the commune, put down their burdens, and perform well; 4. Those who have serious shortcomings and mistakes, and even illegal and undisciplined behavior, but are unwilling to make a deep examination and recognize their mistakes; 5. Those who have low political awareness, do not work, do not play a role, and do not meet the conditions of Party members. We mainly rely on the first three types of people to educate the latter two types of people. Through the rectification of the Party, the active ones are more improved, the passive ones are transformed, and the smooth progress of the rectification is promoted.

    **Implement the Class Line, and Democratically Re-elect Cadres**

The experience of Su厝 Township shows that after the great socialist debate and the rectification of the Party and the commune, the struggle between some well-to-do middle peasants and poor and lower-middle peasants for leadership in the cooperative is still very sharp. 56% of the original team leaders of Qunxing Cooperative were upper-middle peasants. They did not withstand the test of the wind and waves in grasping the direction, and they all showed wavering in implementing the cooperative's management policy and the Party's policy. After the great debate, those well-to-do middle peasants expressed that they wanted to take the socialist road, but they were not convinced by the leadership of the poor peasants. Therefore, when electing cooperative cadres, they still carried out activities everywhere, excluding the poor peasants, and attempted to continue to hold the leadership in each team. The leadership must fully estimate this situation in the election. Ignoring this point will lead to deviations.

In the election of cooperative cadres, an important experience and lesson of Qunxing Cooperative is that on the one hand, we must fully promote democracy, and on the other hand, we must closely rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants and resolutely implement the class line. These two principles must be closely combined and cannot be separated. At first, the leadership of the working group had a paralyzed mind, thinking that after the great debate and the rectification of the Party and the commune, the awareness of the masses had been improved, and it was no problem to establish the leadership advantage of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the cooperative. Therefore, in the masses, only one aspect of democratic election was publicized, and the conditions of the cadres were only put forward, but they did not dare to boldly publicize the class line, nor did they dare to boldly publicize that democracy must have leadership, and they did not pay attention to mobilizing the poor and lower-middle peasants in the election. As a result, some well-to-do middle peasants carried out activities everywhere to win over the masses. They exaggerated the shortcomings of the cadres and the poor peasants, and publicized, "Well-to-do middle peasants have rich production experience and more means of production, so it is better for them to be leaders than poor peasants." At an election meeting of a team, one person nominated, and others echoed in unison, passing it hastily, not giving the poor peasants a chance to speak. The meeting was completely controlled by them. Some even prepared three plans, and took out another one after we overturned one. Some members were not clear about the class line, only considering the technical aspects of production, not considering the political quality, and as a result, they were deceived by them and also echoed their opinions. As a result, in the election of team leaders and member representatives in some places, the advantage of the poor and lower-middle peasants was not guaranteed, and well-to-do middle peasants accounted for more than 40%. In some villages, even good Party members and good cadres lost the election.

The working group discovered this situation and aroused serious attention. It had to suspend the election work and go back to make up the lesson. First, a meeting of poor and lower-middle peasants was held in each village to conduct education on the class line and democratic centralism, and to deliberate on nominations. Then, with the same content, propaganda was carried out at the mass meeting, and a debate was launched to improve everyone's understanding, fully consult, and put forward a list of candidates. After this work, the situation completely changed, ensuring the advantage of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the leadership and representatives of the brigades and teams. Some team leaders who were upper-middle peasants also re-elected poor peasant deputies. On the other hand, attention was also paid to uniting the upper-middle peasants. Upper-middle peasants accounted for about one-third of all cadres.

Facts have proved that although the struggle in politics and ideology in the countryside has not ended after the great debate, only by resolutely relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants and first mobilizing them can the class line be correctly implemented. They account for the majority of the rural population. Mobilizing them will guarantee the election work.

The work of rectifying the Party and consolidating the commune in Qunxing Cooperative has made us deeply realize the importance of following the mass line. At the beginning of the rectification of the Party and the consolidation of the commune, we were clear about this point in our thinking, and we also realized this point when we launched the great socialist debate. However, in actual work, we do not always firmly believe in the majority of the masses, and from time to time we have right-leaning thoughts to varying degrees. Whenever this happens, the development of the work is hindered or lost. Therefore, constantly overcoming right-leaning thoughts, and resolutely relying on the masses, especially on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, is the primary key to achieving complete victory in the work.

    苏厝乡整党整社工作中的群众路线
    中共晋江县委工作组
    福建晋江县苏厝乡群星农业社紧接着粮食和合作化问题大辩论以后，进行了整党整社工作。苏厝乡的经验证明：搞好整党整社的关键，在于充分发动群众，继续进行大鸣大放大争；同时，要根据边整边改的精神，迅速处理实际问题，改进党员、干部的作风。只有这样，才能进一步密切党和群众的联系，促进农业合作社的巩固并搞好生产。
    群众要求大力整改
    在前一个时期的社会主义大辩论当中，苏厝乡根据群众的要求，对干部作风和合作社经营管理等方面的迫切问题，进行了改进。边整边改的结果，鼓励了放鸣，推动了生产，缩小了干部和群众之间的矛盾。
    但是，大辩论中干部作风的改进，只是整改的一个开端，一般还没有涉及到干部个人的具体问题，群众对党员、干部的作风问题大多还未彻底放出来，同时，合作社内部存在的很多主要问题，也都没有得到切实的解决，而群众又迫切地要求解决。因此，必须在大辩论过后，在群众觉悟提高的基础上，着重进行一次彻底的整改。
    从整社入手，改进各方面工作
    从大辩论中群众提出的意见看，干部作风问题、思想问题、经济问题等方面，集中表现在合作社的问题中，而合作社的问题又都反映到党内来，同时群众所迫切要求的，是及时解决合作社存在的问题，特别是清理财务问题。因此，要整顿好党员和干部作风，首先应从整社入手，而整社又首先要从清理财务入手。
    在整社中，主要解决下面几个问题：
    第一、清理和公开财务。群星社的财务情况是“三代账”（互助组、初级社、高级社）未清，“三层账”（社、大队、小队）未结。社员说这是“一团无头线”，他们迫切要求清理，清理财务的关键是走群众路线，而不是关门查账。起先，有些干部手脚不干净，怕自己的问题被揭发，企图加以阻挠；也有些干部看到账目混乱，缺乏信心，怕搞不清楚会受冤枉，但群众的决心很大，信心很强，他们说：“买卖有主，来去有路，作坏事易瞒一人，难瞒众人，最后总是可以搞清的。于是，社里便向社员公布各项收支细账，由社员逐笔核对自己与社来往账；推选专门代表详细检查社队的每一笔账目和每一张发票；对查出的问题，开社员查账代表会酝酿协商，进行解决。这个社由于坚决依靠群众，终于把这团“无头线”弄清了。共清出有贪污与挪用行为的三十二人，贪污和挪用款项一千四百多元，清理、整顿各种账目二百多宗。
    第二、贯彻互利政策，改变和调整社队组织。这也是社干部和社员最迫切的要求。群星社是五个自然村组成的，社大人多，一切大事社决定后才能进行，领导不能及时，加上各大队副业多少和土地好坏不同，社员不易了解全社经济情况，彼此都叫吃亏，互不信任，所以迫切要求分社。因此，为了有利生产、有利发挥合作社的优越性，就决定改变和调整社队组织，采取联社形式，在经济上由各大队自负盈亏。
    第三、抓住增产关键，正确解决对上负责和对下负责的一致性问题。过去领导生产时，经常犯了两种偏向：一是只管对上负责，不根据实际情况，硬性贯彻上级任务，犯了主观主义和强迫命令；一是迁就群众意见，不坚决贯彻上级任务，犯了尾巴主义。比如养猪积肥，是增产增收的重要关键之一。过去上级也布置要扩大冬种面积和增加养猪数量，但因为上级对冬种土地都要求种上大小麦，我们只为了完成冬种任务，没有也不敢提出适当种些猪菜，或提出有效措施解决饲料问题。所以养猪问题实际上只停留在口头上面。这是工作组和党支部在领导生产上的一个难题。这次把这个情况向领导上反映，并召开老农会研究，经过算账后，领导同意这样做，全社用一百亩地来种猪菜，可以增养生猪六百头，既完成冬种任务，又保证养猪的饲料需要，最后把这个问题提到群众中去讨论，群众认为这个办法很好，马上行动起来了。
    第四、改进有关群众生活方面的工作。在大放大鸣和整改中，群众对各经济企业部门提出不少意见。我们都已转达各有关部门，现在有些单位已经改进。
    内外结合，开门整风
    在整社以后，接着的问题是如何争取群众来帮助党的整风。所以再来一次放鸣，集中向党员和干部提意见，是完全必要的，只有让群众把所有的意见都提出来，才能使干部全面认识自己的缺点。
    但是，当时工作组和党支委中一些同志，没有认识到开门整风的重要性，存在着右倾思想。他们低估了群众的力量和党的领导力量，对一些有严重缺点的党员抱着迁就的态度，怕群众提意见过火，干部会躺倒不干；认为农村情况复杂，再放鸣会不会搞乱，干部会不会孤立。在党员、干部中，也产生了新的顾虑，怕群众批评会乱，干部没有威信，今后不好工作。所以想和过去一样，关门整风。他们说：“过去是内部解决，现在叫群众参加，屁股底都给群众知道了。”
    根据这些顾虑，领导上自始至终注意思想教育。在干部中反复说明整风的意义；使他们懂得：只有充分听取群众的意见，才能全面地认识我们工作中的缺点，有利于改进干部作风，有利于合作社的巩固。同时使他们懂得，合作社是大家的，社员都是社的主人，必须和群众商量办事，并在运动中接受群众的监督，听取群众批评，集中群众的智慧，才能提高自己，搞好工作，密切干部和群众的关系。还向干部说明：从处理人民内部矛盾以来，群众所提出的意见，绝大部分都是正确的，群众是懂得道理的，是能够分清是非的，我们应该坚决地相信群众的多数，不要怕乱。
    事实证明：群众提出的意见绝大部分都是正确的，他们提的意见范围很广，包括党员、干部的工作作风、生活作风、干群关系、违法乱纪、贪污腐化、欺骗隐瞒等等，有不少事情是过去领导上所不知道的。群众的批评也很尖锐，但是善意的。他们批评那些躺倒不干的党员说：“你是身在福中不知福，像你这样，还像什么党员？”批评有些干部的缺点说：“如再不改，我们就不再选你当干部了。”后来干部作了深刻的检讨，表示要下定决心改正错误，群众就很欢喜，对党员说：“过去你们关门整风，我们有意见没处提，这次这样做很好。”群众这种明辨是非的态度，也深刻地教育了全体党员和干部，使他们真正认识了群众的力量，反映说：“群众的批评像一面镜子，使我看清了自己的缺点”“群众的批评像特效药，药到病除。”
    在群众放出的意见中，也有少部分是群众中的传闻，缺乏事实根据，也有些是不了解全面，对某些事情发生误解。这些意见，经过查明，分清是非后，就向群众作适当的解释，大家都很满意。也有极少数动机不纯的人，利用放鸣机会到处活动，扩大干部缺点，企图搞垮原有干部。这些错误论调，我们在这段总结时提出来让群众讨论，群众很快就分清是非，给那些人进行有力反驳，保护了干部的积极性。
    依靠积极分子整党整团
    在大辩论和整社当中，有些党员的作风已经有了改进，并取得了群众的信任。但是，从整个支部来说，从群众提的意见来看，党员作风还没有得到彻底的整顿，而且，有些问题在整社中还不能解决，必须放到党内来解决。因此，必须在整社以后，划出一段时间，根据党的组织原则和党员条件，对党的内部进行一次彻底的整顿，同时，在党的领导下，也进行整团工作。
    整党工作是依靠党支部和积极分子去进行的。在党员中，大致可分为五种类型：1、一贯表现好，为群众所拥护的好党员；2、工作积极，问题不大，经过教育就可以转变过来；3、有较严重缺点或错误，和群众关系较紧张，但在整社中已经基本解决问题，放下包袱，表现还好；4、有严重缺点错误甚至有违法乱纪行为，但又不肯深刻检查，认识错误；5、政治觉悟低，不干工作，不起作用，不够党员条件。我们主要是依靠前三种人去教育后两种人，通过整党，使积极的更加提高，使消极的转变过来，促进整风的顺利进行。
    贯彻阶级路线，民主改选干部
    苏厝乡的经验表明：经过社会主义大辩论和整党整社以后，部分富裕中农在合作社中和贫农、下中农争夺领导权的斗争仍然很尖锐。群星社原来的小队长有56％是上中农担任的，他们在方向的掌握上，没有经受起风浪的考验，在贯彻合作社经营方针和党的政策上，都曾表现了动摇。经过大辩论以后，那些富裕中农表示要走社会主义道路，但他们并不服气贫农的领导，因此，在选举社干部时，他们仍然到处活动，排斥贫农，企图继续在各小队中把持领导权。这种形势，领导上在选举中是必须充分估计到的，忽视了这一点，就要出偏差。
    在选举社干部中，群星社一条重要的经验教训是：一方面要充分发扬民主，另方面要紧紧依靠贫农和下中农，坚决贯彻阶级路线。这两条原则必须紧密地结合起来，不能分开。起先，工作组领导上存在麻痹思想，认为经过大辩论和整党整社以后，群众的觉悟已经提高了，在合作社中树立贫农和下中农的领导优势不成问题了。因此，在群众中，只宣传民主选举一个方面，单提出干部的条件，而不敢大胆宣传阶级路线，也不敢大胆宣传民主要有领导，而且，在选举中也没有注意发动贫农和下中农。结果，一些富裕中农到处活动，争取群众。他们夸大干部和贫农的缺点，宣传说：“富裕中农生产经验丰富，生产资料多，比贫农当领导好”。在一个小队的选举会上，他们一个人提名，其他人同声附和，草草通过，不给贫农发言的机会，会议完全由他们掌握过去了。有的甚至准备了三个计划，在我们推翻一个后拿出另一个。有些社员对阶级路线不明确，只考虑生产技术方面，不考虑政治质量方面，结果被他们蒙蔽了，也附和他们的意见。结果有些地方在小队长和社员代表选举中没有保证贫农和下中农的优势，富裕中农占40％以上，有些村连好党员好干部也落选了。
    工作组发现了这个情况，才引起了严重注意，不得不把选举工作暂停下来，回过头来补课。先在各村召开贫农、下中农会议，进行阶级路线和民主集中制教育，酝酿提名，然后以同样的内容，在群众会上进行宣传，并展开了一次辩论，提高大家的认识，充分协商，提出候选人名单。经过这个工作，情况才完全改变，保证了贫农、下中农在大队小队领导和代表中的优势，有些小队领导有上中农担任的，也补选了贫农副职。另方面，也注意了团结上中农。全体干部中，上中农约占三分之一左右。
    事实证明，农村中虽然经过大辩论后，在政治上和思想上的斗争并未结束，只有坚决依靠贫农和下中农，首先把他们发动起来，才能正确地贯彻阶级路线。他们占农村人口的大多数，把他们发动起来，选举工作就有了保证。
    群星社整党整社工作，使我们深刻地体会到走群众路线的重要性。开始整党整社时，我们在思想上对这一点是明确的，在开展社会主义大辩论时，也体会到这一点。但是，在实际工作中却不是经常坚定地相信群众的多数，而程度不同地不时产生右倾思想。每当这样的时候，就使工作的开展受到了阻碍或损失。因此，不断克服右倾思想，坚决依靠群众，首先是依靠广大贫农和下中农，是取得工作完全胜利的首要关键。
