　　Welcoming Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein
　　Speech by Deputy Prime Minister He Long at the Airport

Respected Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein, Friends, Comrades:

　　We are very happy and honored that Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein and the Burmese Friendly Economic Delegation he leads have come to our country for a friendly visit at the invitation of our Premier Zhou Enlai. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I extend a warm welcome to the Deputy Prime Minister and other distinguished Burmese guests.

　　The Chinese people highly cherish the fraternal friendship that has long existed between the people of China and Burma. We are pleased that after both countries have shaken off the shackles of colonialism, this traditional friendship has developed further on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Leaders of the two governments have established close friendships and ties through frequent contact, thereby promoting the development of friendship between the two countries. This time, Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein is leading a delegation to visit our country to inspect our economic construction. Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe will also come for a friendly visit in a few days. They will also have cordial talks with our national leaders. There is no doubt that the friendly visits of the two Deputy Prime Ministers will further deepen mutual understanding and enhance our cooperation between our two countries.

　　Deputy Prime Minister, China is your close neighbor, and we sincerely hope that you will be as comfortable and happy during your visit as you would be at home.

　　Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Burma!

　  欢迎吴觉迎副总理
　　贺龙副总理在机场上的讲话尊敬的吴觉迎副总理阁下，朋友们，同志们：
    吴觉迎副总理和他率领的缅甸友好经济考察团应我国周恩来总理的邀请，前来我国进行友好访问，我们感到非常高兴和荣幸。我代表中国政府和中国人民向副总理阁下和其他缅甸贵宾们表示热忱的欢迎。
    中国人民十分珍视中缅两国人民之间久已存在的兄弟友谊。我们高兴地看到在两国摆脱殖民主义的束缚之后，这种传统友谊在五项原则的基础上有了更进一步的发展。两国政府领导人员通过频繁的接触已经建立了亲切的友谊和联系，从而促进了两国的友谊的发展。这次吴觉迎副总理率领代表团访问我国，考察我国的经济建设情况。几天以后吴巴瑞副总理也将前来进行友好访问。他们并将同我国国家领导人进行亲切晤谈。毫无疑问，通过两位副总理的友好访问必将进一步加深我们两国之间的互相了解并增进我们的合作。
    副总理阁下，中国是你们的亲戚邻邦，我们衷心地希望你们在访问期间能像在自己家里一样，过得舒适愉快。
    中缅两国人民的友谊万岁！
