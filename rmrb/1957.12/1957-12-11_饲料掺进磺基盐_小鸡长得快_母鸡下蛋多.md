　　Feed Mixed with Sulfonic Acid Salt
　　Chicks Grow Faster, Hens Lay More Eggs
　　Moscow, December 10 (Report from our newspaper) Feeding chicks with sulfonic acid salt (a byproduct produced during oil refining) makes chicks grow very quickly. This is the result of numerous extensive experiments conducted by scientists at Azerbaijan State University at a chicken farm in Baku. When the scholars added sulfonic acid salt to the feed for Russian-bred chicks, the weight of these chicks exceeded the normal standard by 20% to 25% within sixty days. If the feeding conditions were better, it could exceed 30%. When feed containing sulfonic acid salt is fed to hens, the egg production rate of the hens can increase by 20%. Currently, Soviet scientists are further experimenting with the precise amount of sulfonic acid salt to use in chicken feed.

　　饲料掺进磺基盐
    小鸡长得快　母鸡下蛋多
    本报莫斯科10日电用磺基盐（在石油提炼过程中生产出来的副产品）喂小鸡，小鸡成长得很快。这是阿塞拜疆国立大学科学家们在巴库一个养鸡场多次广泛试验的结果。学者们在俄罗斯种的小鸡喂养的饲料中，加上了磺基盐，结果在六十天内这种小鸡的体重就超过了普通标准20％到25％，如果喂养条件更好，就能超过30％。把含有磺基盐的饲料喂母鸡时，母鸡的产蛋率就可能增加20％。目前苏联科学家正在进一步试验用含磺基盐饲料喂鸡的准确数量。
