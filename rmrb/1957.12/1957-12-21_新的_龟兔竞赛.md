    A New "Tortoise and the Hare" Race
    Eisenhower does not admit that the American economy is in recession. He only believes that the American economy now needs to "take a break."
    This is truly a clever remark. However, the question immediately arises: Hasn't America admitted that it lags behind the Soviet Union in many areas? So why "take a break"? Already behind, and still "taking a break"! This is indeed a new "Tortoise and the Hare" race, and the American tortoise is destined to lose.

    新的“龟兔竞赛”
    艾森豪威尔不承认美国经济正在衰退。他只认为，美国经济现在需要“休息一番”了。
    这真是一种妙语。但是，问题马上来了：美国不是承认在许多方面落后于苏联了吗？那么为什么还要“休息”呢？已经落后，还要“休息”！这倒是一场新的“龟兔竞赛”，而美国乌龟是输定了。
