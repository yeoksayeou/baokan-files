    Telephone
  　Li Kunchun
    Ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling,
    The supply and marketing cooperative's phone is busy,
    Customers are waiting to buy goods in front of the door,
    The manager is sweating with anxiety.
    "What? What?
    As soon as the cadres go to the countryside,
    All the farm tools are sold out,
    There's nothing I can do, the stock is low,
    Customers are already lined up at the door."
              (Changsha, Hunan)

    电话
  　李昆纯
    叮铃铃，叮铃铃
    供销社里电话忙，
    门前顾客等着买货，
    经理急得汗直淌。
    “什么？什么？
    干部一下乡，
    农具全卖光，
    没法呀，存货少，
    门前顾客已经排成行。”
              （湖南长沙）
