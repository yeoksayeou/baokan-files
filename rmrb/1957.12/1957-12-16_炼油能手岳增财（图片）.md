　　Oil Refining Expert Yue Zengcai
    Yue Zengcai is the deputy foreman of Work Section One of the East Crude Oil Workshop at the Fushun Petroleum Plant No. 1. For the past eight years, he has actively participated in socialist emulation drives and has been continuously recognized as a labor model at the plant and city levels since 1952. He actively responds to the Party's call, organizing workers to learn advanced experiences. Not long ago, they made a guarantee that in the last two months of the first Five-Year Plan, they would increase crude oil production for the country by 400 tons; and for every ton of crude oil refined, they would use 1.5 tons less shale oil than originally planned.

　　炼油能手岳增财
    岳增财是抚顺石油一厂东原油车间一工段副工长，八年来，他一直积极参加社会主义竞赛，从1952年开始连续被评为全厂和市级的劳动模范。他积极响应党的号召，组织职工学习先进经验。不久以前，他们曾提出保证，要在第一个五年计划最后两个月里，为国家增产原油四百吨；每炼一吨原油比原计划少用一点五吨页岩。
