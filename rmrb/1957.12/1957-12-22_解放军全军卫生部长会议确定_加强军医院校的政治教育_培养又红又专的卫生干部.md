Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: At the All-Army Health Department Heads Conference, Lieutenant General Rao Zhengxi, Director of the General Logistics Department Health Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said on the 20th that political education must be strengthened in the military medical universities and all military medical schools in the troops, so that students can establish the idea of serving the socialist national defense construction wholeheartedly, and cultivate health cadres who are both red and expert who serve the troops.

　　Rao Zhengxi said that in the past, there were erroneous ideas of aiming too high and being unrealistic among students in military medical schools. Some students were unwilling to serve the soldiers in the troops after leaving school; some looked down on the veteran health cadres in the troops who had many years of experience and practical experience. This is very bad. In the future, we must strengthen political education in military medical universities and all colleges and schools of the troops to cultivate health cadres who are both red and expert who serve the socialist national defense construction wholeheartedly. Rao Zhengxi pointed out: To make students both red and expert, we must first conduct ideological education and transformation of professors and teachers in colleges and universities. In addition to organizing professors and teachers to conduct political studies, we must also make them frequently contact the troops, understand the situation of the troops, and truly become "role models."

　　Rao Zhengxi said that to train health cadres of the troops who are both red and expert, we must also carry out the education of the fine traditions of our army's health work in military medical schools, so that students can inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of our army's health work. In addition, in military medical schools, we must also implement the education of the principle of prevention first and serving the troops, and develop correct and excellent medical style.

　　The All-Army Health Department Heads Conference convened by the General Logistics Department Health Department opened in Beijing on the 5th and ended on the 20th. The conference studied the principle of prevention first in the health work of the troops, training cadres, streamlining the organization of the health departments of the troops, running health undertakings diligently and thriftily, developing national defense medical science undertakings, and implementing the policy of traditional Chinese medicine in the spirit of rectification.

    解放军全军卫生部长会议确定
    加强军医院校的政治教育  培养又红又专的卫生干部
    据新华社21日讯  中国人民解放军总后勤部卫生部部长饶正锡中将20日在全军卫生部长会议上说，要在部队的军医大学和所有军医院校中加强政治教育，使学生树立全心全意为社会主义的国防建设服务的思想，培养面向部队为兵服务的又红又专的卫生干部。
    饶正锡说，在部队军医院校的学生中，过去存在着好高骛远的错误思想。有些学生出校后不愿意到部队里为兵服务；有的到了部队里，瞧不起部队里经过多年锻炼、有实际工作经验的老卫生干部。这是很不好的。今后必须加强部队军医大学和所有院、校的政治教育，培养全心全意为社会主义的国防建设服务的又红又专的卫生干部。饶正锡指出：要使学生又红又专，首先就要对院校教授、教员进行思想教育与改造。这除了组织教授、教员们进行政治学习外，还要使他们经常接触部队，了解部队的情况，真正成为“为人师表”。
    饶正锡说，要培养又红又专的部队卫生干部，还要在军医院校中进行我军卫生工作优良传统的教育，使学生能继承与发扬我军卫生工作的优良传统。此外，在军医院校中，还要贯彻预防为主、面向部队为兵服务的方针的教育，养成正确的优良的医疗作风。
    总后勤部卫生部召开的全军卫生部长会议5日在北京开幕，20日结束。会上以整风的精神研究了部队预防为主的卫生工作方针、培养干部、紧缩部队卫生部门机构、勤俭办卫生事业、发展国防医学科学事业和贯彻中医政策等问题。
