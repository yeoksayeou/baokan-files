Reporting Victory to Six Hundred Million People
　　By our reporter Zhou Qingyu
　　It is no longer a new thing to see domestically manufactured airplanes soaring in the skies of our motherland. In 1954, I saw the completion of the first airplane, and in 1956, I saw jet planes being produced in batches. This year, seeing the birth of the "An-2" civilian aircraft gives me a particularly fresh feeling.
　　The "An-2" aircraft is not a helicopter, but its takeoff and landing are similar to a helicopter. It does not require a dedicated airport or runway, only a flat ground of 200 meters. When filled with gasoline, it can fly continuously in the sky for more than eight hours without landing. It can fly at an ultra-low altitude of five meters above the ground, and its fuel consumption is very low. It is very safe. In the event of engine failure, it can extend its slotted wings and drift down, landing in a predetermined location.
　　The "An-2" aircraft has many uses, and if slightly modified, its uses will be even greater. When large areas of farmland are plagued by pests, driving the "An-2" aircraft can spray insecticide powder on 30,000 to 40,000 mu of crops every day. In 1954, Dafeng County, Jiangsu, used this type of aircraft to spray 37,000 mu of cotton fields, increasing cotton production by a value of 360,000 yuan. The "An-2" aircraft is an aerial machine in modern agricultural machinery. On Soviet collective farms, a large number of aircraft are used for fertilization, pest and disease control, sowing, defoliation...
　　When industrial construction urgently needs to explore mineral resources, the "An-2" aircraft can undertake the task of aerial prospecting and general surveys, and it can survey 1,000 square kilometers in six hours. The "An-2" aircraft is an indispensable tool for surveying and protecting forests. When natural disasters occur in primitive forests, and manpower cannot extinguish them, driving this type of aircraft can quickly detect the disaster and extinguish the disaster. When mountain floods break out, river water rises sharply, and individual areas experience major floods, the "An-2" aircraft can take off and land on the water, airdrop supplies, and rescue people. In national defense sports activities, it can be used for parachuting; in remote mountainous areas, it is the best tool for transporting books and newspapers.
　　According to an engineer, trial production of this aircraft is a new test for China's aviation industry. The time is short, the workload is large, and the technical requirements are high, so it was not easy to achieve this task. However, when the workers understood its role in national economic construction, all their strength and wisdom surged like a fountain. They studied the process flow themselves, carried out process equipment themselves, the production commando teams expanded day by day, the new records created increased day by day, and the determination to overcome key difficulties became stronger and stronger, completing the trial production task a quarter ahead of schedule. This fully demonstrates the great creativity of the Chinese working class, and also demonstrates the improvement of China's aviation industry's technical level and the enhancement of its creative capabilities.
　　Now, the aviation industry of New China is moving towards a more advanced and more precise modernization. After the first aircraft flies out of the factory, more aircraft will follow, flying to remote mountainous areas, flying to the ocean of forests, flying to the Gobi Desert, and flying to the beautiful farms. Decades later, the skies of our motherland will be filled with various professional aviation networks, and our professional aircraft will soar in the sky like flocks of pigeons.

    向六亿人民报捷
    本报记者　周擎宇
    在祖国的天空，翱翔着自己制造的飞机，并不是什么新鲜事情了。1954年我看到了第一架飞机的制成，1956年又看到了喷气式飞机成批生产，今年我看到“安二”型民用飞机的诞生，却有十分新鲜之感。
    “安二”型飞机不是直升飞机，不过它的起飞和降落却同直升飞机差不多，不需要专门的机场和跑道，只要有一块二百公尺长的平坦地面就行了。它装满汽油可以在天空连续飞行八小时以上，不用着陆。它能够在距地面五公尺的超低空飞行，而且耗油量很少。它非常安全，在发动机万一发生故障的时候，它可以伸出自己的缝翼飘飞下来，降落在预定的地方。
    “安二”型飞机用途很大，如果略加改装，用途就更大。当大面积的农田发生虫灾的时候，驾驶“安二”飞机每天可以在三万到四万亩的庄稼上喷洒杀虫药粉。1954年江苏大丰县用这种飞机在三万七千亩的棉田上喷洒药粉，即增产棉花价值三十六万元。“安二”飞机是现代农业机械中的空中机械，在苏联的农庄里，拥有着大批的飞机，用来施肥、除病虫害、播种、落叶……。
    当工业建设迫切需要探明矿藏资源的时候，“安二”飞机就可以担负起航空探矿和普查的任务，在六个小时内它可以查清一千平方公里的地方。“安二”飞机是调查森林和保护森林不可缺少的工具。当原始森林发生自然灾、人力无法扑灭的时候，驾驶这种飞机能够很快发现灾情，扑灭灾害。当山洪暴发，河水猛涨，个别地区发生大水灾的时候，“安二”飞机可以在水上起飞和着落，空投物资，救护人民。在国防体育活动中，利用它跳伞；在偏僻的山区里，利用它传送书报，也是最好的工具。
    据一位工程师谈，试制这种飞机，是对我国航空工业新的考验。时间很短，工作量很大，技术要求又很高，实现这个任务本来是不容易的事情，然而当工人们明白了他对国民经济的建设作用，一切力量和智慧像喷泉一样涌出来了。他们自己研究工艺过程，自己进行工艺装备，生产突击队一天天扩大，创造的新纪录一天天增多，克服关键的毅力一个比一个强，提前一个季度完成了试制任务。这充分表现了中国工人阶级伟大的创造性，也表现了我国航空工业技术水平的提高，创造能力的增强。
    现在新中国的航空工业正在向着更先进、也更精密的现代化迈进，第一架飞机从工厂飞出去以后，接着会有更多的飞机飞出去，飞往偏僻的山区，飞往森林的海洋，飞往戈壁沙漠，飞往锦绣般的农庄。数十年后，祖国的天空将满布各种专业航空网，我们专业飞机将像鸽群一般高翔在天上。
