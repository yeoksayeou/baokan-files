Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 9th: Antara News Agency reported that Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio stated on the 8th that Indonesia does not intend to submit the West Irian issue to the United Nations for discussion next year. He pointed out that Indonesia has done this four times, but without result each time.

Subandrio made these remarks to reporters upon returning to Jakarta after attending this year's United Nations General Assembly discussion on the West Irian issue. He also said that Indonesia still believes that this dispute with the Netherlands can be resolved peacefully. However, it is now the Netherlands' turn to take the initiative to negotiate on this issue.

In answering reporters' questions, Subandrio stated that it would be inappropriate for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to interfere in the West Irian issue.

Mrs. Pujobuntoro, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Indonesian Parliament, told reporters today that the Netherlands' appeal to NATO for assistance is not surprising. However, it must be pointed out that no country can interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs.

Mrs. Pujobuntoro said that the actions currently taken by Indonesia are consistent with the purpose of abolishing the Round Table Conference agreements.

　　印度尼西亚外长表示
　　西伊里安问题不再提交联大
    新华社雅加达9日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约在8日表示，印度尼西亚明年不打算再把西伊里安问题提交联合国讨论。他指出，印度尼西亚已经这样做过四次，但是四次都没有获得结果。
    苏班德里约是在纽约参加了今年联合国大会关于西伊里安问题的讨论以后回到雅加达时对记者这样说的。他还说，印度尼西亚仍然认为可以用和平方式来解决同荷兰的这个争端。但是，现在是轮到荷兰采取主动来就这个问题进行谈判的时候了。
    在回答记者的问题时，苏班德里约表示，北大西洋公约组织如果也来干预西伊里安问题，那将是不适当的。
    印度尼西亚国会外交委员会主席普佐邦托罗夫人今天对记者说，荷兰向北大西洋公约组织求援并不令人惊异。但是必须指出，任何国家都不能干涉印度尼西亚的内政。
    普佐邦托罗夫人说，目前印度尼西亚所采取的行动同废除圆桌会议协定的目的是一致的。
