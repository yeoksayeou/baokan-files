　　Long Study Time, Low Living Allowance

　　I think the State Council's regulations (draft) on the length of apprenticeship and living allowances are inappropriate: the study time is too long, and the living allowance is too low.

　　In the old society, masters abused and exploited apprentices, were conservative, and were unwilling to teach their skills; in addition, apprentices at that time had low levels of education, mostly illiterate, or at most primary school level, so the apprenticeship period was only three years. However, in the new society, masters do not exploit apprentices, nor are they conservative with their techniques; apprentices also have much higher levels of education, some are high school graduates, and even the lower ones have higher primary school levels, so they learn techniques faster. Yet, the apprenticeship period is still stipulated to be three years which is too long. In the administrative departments, some trainees are fully capable from the beginning, and at most they only need a year. Therefore, I suggest that the State Council arrange the length of apprenticeship according to the nature of different types of work and the different levels of education of the apprentices. That is, the apprenticeship period for apprentices learning techniques should be: two to two and a half years for those with higher primary school education, and one to one and a half years for those with secondary school education; the apprenticeship period for apprentices learning administrative work should be: one and a half to two years for those with higher primary school education, and one to one and a half years for those with secondary school education. Moreover, those with excellent academic performance, who possess certain abilities, and obtain the qualifications of working people, can be employed in advance. Those with poor academic performance may have their study period extended appropriately.

　　In the old society, apprentices were mostly twelve or thirteen years old, and their families did not depend on them for living expenses. The boss provided food and clothing, and if they did well in their studies, their treatment could be increased, and they could be employed in advance. However, the living allowance stipulated in the draft only covers food, not clothing, and is only one or two yuan per month, without any provisions for increasing treatment and employing them in advance based on good academic performance. This is unreasonable. The treatment should be appropriately increased based on the work effect to encourage learning enthusiasm.

　　Divide the Apprenticeship Period into Three Stages

　　I think it is not perfect to rigidly stipulate that the apprenticeship period is three years, because everyone differs in terms of physiology, intelligence, and will, and the differences can be quite large in some cases. My suggestion is to divide the apprenticeship period into three stages, and the apprenticeship should be considered complete at the end of these three stages.

　　First, the mastery stage—from the beginning of the apprenticeship to being able to master the technique. The length of this time should be flexibly determined according to the apprentice's speed of learning, but the end of this stage does not mean that the learned technique is already proficient.

　　Second, the familiarity stage—from being able to master the technique to catching up with the master. The length of this stage should be uniformly stipulated according to the nature of the work.

　　Third, the understanding and application stage—from the proficient stage to being able to theoretically explain the technique, that is, until practice is combined with theory. The length of this stage should be uniformly stipulated according to the complexity of the technique.

　　I think that after going through these three stages (including ideological education time), the apprentice can become a worker who is good in skills, ideology, and health. Rigidly stipulating the years will cause apprentices to develop the idea of ​​looking forward to the expiration date.

　　Handicraft Apprentices Should Also Study for Three Years

　　I am a handicraft worker. I fully support the regulations on the apprenticeship period and living allowance announced by the State Council. In our handicraft workers' ranks, some apprentices think that handicrafts are simple and can be learned quickly. They do not seriously study the craft, and after learning a little bit, they think they have learned enough. They are self-righteous and have no respect for anyone, and even look down on the master. Some time ago, the Zhangjiakou City Sewing Cooperative and Pasteboard Cooperative had many returned or defective products, most of which were made by apprentices who had only studied for one or two years and had just graduated. Some apprentices hold the idea of ​​"becoming a third-grade worker in one year and an eighth-grade worker in three years" to learn the craft. As a result, they have not learned the craft well, but have developed a tendency to pursue wages and benefits and neglect politics, failing the country and the master's training, and harming themselves. Therefore, I think that stipulating the apprenticeship period as three years is also suitable for handicrafts. In this way, the master can systematically and step-by-step transmit the skills, and the apprentices have enough time to seriously learn the techniques. More importantly, within three years, apprentices can learn some of the excellent qualities that young people lack from the master, such as diligence, hard work, and simplicity.

　　Three Modification Opinions

　　In order to make the "Provisional Regulations (Draft) of the State Council on the Apprenticeship Period and Living Allowances for Apprentices in State-owned, Joint State-Private, Cooperative, and Individual Enterprises and Institutions" more perfect, I put forward three modification opinions.

　　First, the provisions for the apprentice living allowance standard are appropriate, but a sentence should be added: "During the Spring Festival each year, the unit can give an extra 12 yuan or less of pocket money according to the specific circumstances of the apprentice's study and life." This is in line with the traditional habits of our country in training apprentices, which can make the apprentices have a happy holiday and encourage their learning enthusiasm.

　　Second, change "must not be transferred to a formal worker or staff member before the expiration of the study period" to "generally not". In this way, according to the special needs of the country, after passing a strict examination, excellent apprentices can be selected to graduate early.

　　Third, it is right for enterprises to sign contracts with apprentices. However, apprentices are generally young, and the contract may have little binding force on them. Therefore, I suggest changing it to signing contracts with the parents or guardians of the apprentices. This can increase the sense of responsibility of parents or guardians, prompting them to strengthen education for apprentices, so as not to have the bias of sending their children to factories and then ignoring them. In case the apprentice is dismissed or suspended in the future for violating the contract, it will be easier to handle.

　　大家来讨论国务院公布的四项规定草案
    学习时间长，生活补贴低
    我认为国务院关于学徒工学习期限和生活补贴的规定（草案）不妥当：学习时间长了，生活补贴低了。
    旧社会里，师傅虐待、剥削徒弟，保守，不愿把手艺教给徒弟；加以那时候学徒的文化水平低，大多不识字，最高也不过小学程度，学习期限才三年。但是，在新社会里，师傅不剥削徒弟，也不保守技术了；徒工的文化水平也高得多了，高的是中学毕业，低的也有高小程度，学习技术快了，学习期限还要规定三年就长了。在行政部门的业务方面，有的练习生一开始就完全能够胜任，顶多也不过一年就会了。因此，我建议国务院，根据不同工种的性质、学徒不同的文化程度来安排学习期限。即，学习技术的学徒的学习期限规定为：具有高小程度的二年到二年半，中学程度的一年到一年半；学行政业务的学徒的学习期限规定为：具有高小程度的一年半到二年，中学程度的一年到一年半。而且，对学习成绩优良，具备了一定能力，取得劳动人民资格的，可提前任用。学习成绩不好的，学习期限可适当延长。
    在旧社会，学徒年龄大多十二、三岁，家庭生活根本不依靠它，老板管吃管穿，学习成绩好，还可增加待遇，提前任用。可是，草案规定的生活补贴，只管吃，不管穿，每月只有一、二块钱，又没有因为学习成绩好增加待遇和提前任用的规定。不合理。待遇应当根据工作效果给以适当提高，以鼓励学习积极性。

    把学徒期限分成三个阶段
    我觉得硬性规定学徒学习期限为三年不够完善，因为每个人在生理、智慧、意志等方面都有所不同，个别的还相差悬殊。我的建议把学徒期限分成三个阶段，这三个阶段结束，就算学习期满。
    第一、掌握阶段——从学徒开始到能掌握技术。这个时间长短，要根据学徒技术快慢灵活掌握，但这个阶段结束，并不等于学习的技术已经熟练。
    第二、熟习阶段——以能掌握到赶上老师傅。这个阶段时间的长短，应根据工作性质统一规定。
    第三、理解发挥阶段——从熟练阶段到能把那套技术从理论上阐述，即到实际与理论结合起来为止。这个阶段要根据技术的复杂程度统一规定时间的长短。
    我觉得徒工经过这三个阶段（包括思想教育时间），就可以成为技术好、思想好、身体好的工人。硬性规定年限，会使徒工产生盼期满的思想。

　　手工业学徒也要学三年
    我是一个手工业工作者。国务院公布的关于学徒的学习期限和生活补贴的规定，我完全拥护。在我们手工业者的队伍里，有些学徒工认为手工业简单，一学就会，不去认真的学习手艺，学到一点皮毛，就认为学得差不多了，自以为是，目中无人，连师傅也瞧不起。前些日子，张家口市缝纫社、袼褙社的返修品或次品很多，大部是才学了一二年的、刚出师的徒弟干的活。有些学徒则抱着“一年当个三级工、三年当个八级工”的念头来学手艺，结果手艺没有学好，却产生了追求工资福利而忽视政治的倾向，辜负了国家和师傅的培养，也害了自己。所以，我认为，学徒期限规定为三年，对手工业也是适合的。这样，师傅可以有计划、有步骤地传授本领，徒弟也有充分的时间认真地学技术。更重要的，在三年内徒工能够在老师傅身上学到一些年青人所缺少的优良品质，如勤劳、艰苦朴素等等。张家口市中蒙古营六道巷二号　雪　梅
    三点修改意见
    为了使“国务院关于国营、公私合营、合作社营、个体经营的企业和事业单位的学徒的学习期限和生活补贴的暂行规定（草案）”更加完善，我提出三点修改意见。
    第一，学徒生活补贴标准的规定是恰当的，但应增加一句：“每年春节时，所在单位可以根据学徒的学习、生活等具体情况，加发十二元以下的零用钱。”这是符合我国培养学徒的传统习惯的，可使学徒过一个快乐的节日，鼓舞他们的学习热情。
    第二，把“在学习期限未满以前，一律不得提前转为正式工人、职员”中的“一律”改为“一般”。这样，可以根据国家的特殊需要，经过严格考试合格，挑选优秀的学徒提前满师出徒。
    第三，企业同学徒之间订立合同是应该的。但学徒一般年纪轻，和他们订立合同，对他们的约束力可能较小。因此，我建议改为同学徒的家长或监护人订立合同比较好。这样可以提高家长或监护人的责任心，促使他们对学徒加强教育，不致产生把子弟送入工厂就不管了的偏向。万一将来学徒因违反合同而被辞退或停学时，也比较容易处理。
