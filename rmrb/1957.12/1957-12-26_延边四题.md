    Four Themes of Yanbian
    Zhang Tingyan
    Border Guards
    Every morning, before the sun rises, when the heavy fog still shrouds the earth, the “嗡…嗡…” of the engine, which awakens me, comes from the road. One after another, grass-green border guard vehicles break through the dense, milky-white morning mist, heading towards the rising sun. The tops of the car cabs and the border guards’ caps are filled with pine branches, looking like patches of verdant pine trees from afar.
    At this time, the sun slowly rises, reddening the faces of the border guards. I watch the speeding cars and wish them a successful day of exercises.
    In the evening, the rosy clouds are like watered-red silk, winding around the mountaintops, and dusk is about to fall. The “嗡…嗡…” of the engine comes again from the road, and the border guard vehicles head towards the brilliantly glowing west. Dust, grass stalks… cover the border guards; a trace of fatigue hangs on their dark red, shiny faces.
    Night falls, and the earth is about to sleep. I watch the speeding cars and say in my heart: People’s soldiers, you’ve worked hard!
    Riverside
    The river surface is only twenty meters wide, flowing past us glittering in the light, the river water is transparent and crystal clear.
    We took off our shoes, rolled up our trouser legs, and walked hand in hand into the river. Instantly, the river water froze our feet. As we walked further, the water covered our calves. The water was cold and our feet hurt, so we retreated.
    An old Korean woman came along carrying firewood on her back. As she walked past us, we saw that her face was already covered with wrinkles, and her black hair was streaked with silver.
    The old woman took off her shoes and rolled her trouser legs above her knees.
    “Old woman, the river is deep and cold…” I ran forward to stop her.
    “It’s alright,” the old woman smiled.
    The old woman walked into the river as if walking on a flat road; the river water reached her calves, the river water covered her knees…
    “Don’t go any further!” I almost shouted.
    However, the old woman steadily crossed the center of the river. The water became shallower, and her knees were exposed; the water became shallower, and her calves were exposed…
    The three of us exchanged glances, and in a moment of silence, we made a decision. We took off our shoes again, rolled up our trousers, and strode towards the center of the river. We felt that the river water was shallower than before, and warmer than before…
    Footsteps
    Treading on the rose-colored sunset glow, I climbed this small mountain. When I raised my eyes and looked around, I was astonished…
    Two months ago, I climbed this mountain top with a curious heart. At that time, the mountains were covered in lush greenery, fresh and vibrant; the blooming wildflowers, bright red, light yellow, crystal blue… nodded and smiled. I saw workers enthusiastically laying the foundation below the mountain, and the pounding songs floated to the top of the mountain. I thought: The severe cold is coming, and if the foundation is not laid well, work will have to stop…
    But today, the grass is withered, the leaves have fallen, the flowers have withered, and the first silver snow has fallen. The buildings below the mountain already stand before my eyes, the silver-gray school, the red workers’ dormitory, the gray department store… It’s as if they sprang from the ground overnight.
    The border city is advancing.
    I look at these buildings and hear the heroic footsteps of the motherland.
    Red Scarf
    Like every Sunday, the city is crowded with people.
    “Pedestrians use the sidewalk! Pedestrians…” A clear voice came from the road. I saw children with red scarves fluttering on their chests, maintaining traffic order at the crossroads.
    Red scarves are flying everywhere. On the road, red scarves replace the police; in the cinema, red scarves replace the attendants; in the park, red scarves replace the guides; in… Here, the red scarf has become an indispensable part of life.
    “Attention! Car going east!”
    In the cold wind, the red scarf flies even higher; in the silver snow, the red scarf appears even redder.

    延边四题
    张庭延
    边防军
    每当清晨，太阳还没有升起，浓重的雾霭还笼罩着大地的时候，唤我起床的“嗡……嗡……”的马达声，就从公路上传来。一辆辆草绿色的边防军的汽车，冲破浓重的乳白的晨雾，向着太阳出升的方向驶去。汽车驾驶室顶上、边防军的军帽上，插满了松枝，远远望去，像片片苍绿的松树。
    这时，太阳徐徐地升起，染红了边防军的脸。我望着奔驰的汽车，祝他们一天演习成功。
    傍晚，霞云像水红的绸子，萦绕在四周的山顶，暮色就要降临了。“嗡……嗡……”的马达声又从公路上传来，边防军的汽车，向着霞光灿烂的西方驶去。灰尘、草梗……沾满边防军一身；他们那黑红发亮的脸上，挂上了一丝倦容。
    夜幕拉下来了，大地就要入睡了。我望着奔驰的汽车，心里说：人民的战士，辛苦了！
    江边
    江面，只有二十公尺宽，在我们面前闪着光流过，江水透明，清澈见底。
    我们脱了鞋，卷起裤腿儿，手拉着手，走进了江水，登时，江水冻木了我们的脚，再往前走，江水没了腿肚子，水凉脚痛，我们退了回来。
    一位朝鲜族的老妈妈，背着柴禾走来，当她走过我们面前时，我们看到：她的脸上已堆上皱纹，黑发里掺着银丝。
    老妈妈脱下鞋，把裤腿卷过膝盖。
    “老妈妈，江水又深又凉……”我跑上前去阻拦。
    “不要紧。”老妈妈笑了。
    老妈妈走进了江水，像走在平路上一样；江水齐到了腿肚子，江水没了膝盖……
    “不要往前走了！”我几乎喊了出来。
    但是，老妈妈平平稳稳地越过了江中心，水浅了，膝盖露了出来；水浅了，腿肚子露了出来……。
    我们三个人的眼光碰到了一起，无语的瞬间做了决定，我们重新脱掉鞋，卷起裤子，大踏步地向江心走去，我们觉得江水比刚才浅了，比刚才温暖了。……
    脚步声
    踏着蔷薇色的晚霞，登上这座小山，当我举目四眺时，我吃惊了……
    两个月前，我怀着好奇的心登上了这座山顶。那时，遍山水绿，鲜润欲滴；盛开的野花，艳红的，淡黄的，晶蓝的……颔首微笑。我看到山下，工人们热情地打地基，夯歌飘到山顶。我想：严寒就要来了，地基打不好就要收工……
    而今天，草枯了，叶落了，花谢了，飞过了第一场银雪，山下的楼房已屹立在我的眼前，银灰色的学校，红色的工人宿舍，灰色的百货公司……真像一夜间从土里钻出来的一样。
    边疆的城市在前进。
    我望着这片楼房，听到了祖国豪迈的脚步声。
    红领巾
    和每个星期日一样，城市被人流挤满了。
    “行人走便道！行人……”清亮的嗓音从马路上传来，我看见在十字路口，胸前飘着红领巾的孩子们，在维持着交通秩序。
    到处飘着红领巾，在马路上，红领巾代替了警察；在电影院里，红领巾代替了服务员；在公园里，红领巾代替了向导；在……。这里，红领巾成了生活中必不可少的一部分。
    “注意啦！汽车东去！”
    在寒风中，红领巾飘得更高；在银雪中，红领巾显得更红。
