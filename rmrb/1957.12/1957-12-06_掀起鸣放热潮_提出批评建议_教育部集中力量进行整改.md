    Unleash a Tide of Airing Views, Offer Criticism and Suggestions
　　The Ministry of Education Concentrates Efforts on Rectification
    (Our Dispatch) Since entering the third stage of the rectification campaign on November 10th, the Ministry of Education (including four directly affiliated units such as the People's Education Press) has seen many staff members posting big-character posters, offering criticisms and suggestions on the shortcomings in the various tasks of the Ministry of Education. As of November 29th, one thousand two hundred and eight people had posted three thousand three hundred and three big-character posters, putting forward six thousand seven hundred and seventy-five opinions. These opinions mainly criticized the bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism in the work of the leaders of the Ministry of Education and various business departments and bureaus, as well as deviations in the implementation of policies and guidelines. For example, many big-character posters within the ministry criticized certain Party member vice-ministers for having serious bureaucratic work styles that were divorced from reality and the masses. The Party member vice-minister in charge of worker-peasant education never attended a meeting of the Worker-Peasant Education Bureau and rarely went down to inspect work. Individual Party member deputy directors routinely had their official seals signed and handled official documents by the chief secretary on their behalf. The Chinese language editors of the People's Education Publishing House criticized the Party member deputy director of the publishing house for not frequently going to the editorial office to provide specific leadership. Some big-character posters criticized the Ministry of Education for not sufficiently implementing the class line in school settings. Middle schools, especially high schools, were mostly concentrated in cities, and restrictions on farmers' children entering cities to attend school were too strict, resulting in a relatively slow increase in the proportion of worker-peasant children among students. In addition, many valuable opinions were put forward in the big-character posters regarding institutional aspects, Party and League work, cadre training, material welfare, and waste in the organs. These opinions also included proactive suggestions. For example, many comrades put forward specific plans on how to implement the class line in education work and streamline institutions in the future. Some comrades at the publishing house suggested separating the editorial department from the publishing section to allow the editors to concentrate on compiling textbooks.
    This high tide of airing views is inseparable from a series of preparatory work carried out before the launch of the movement. First, the ministry's leading group repeatedly carried out ideological mobilization based on the ideological situation of leading cadres and the masses during the preparation for entering the third stage. For example, the ministry's leading group convened meetings of Party member directors and deputy directors of bureaus, and many units convened meetings of Party member cadres above the section level, so that leading cadres had the ideological preparation to "burn themselves" and accept criticism. At the same time, it convened rallies of Party members and mass activists, and mobilization meetings of all staff members. Based on the ideological situation of the masses, it repeatedly dispelled concerns and called on Party members, League members, and activists to take the lead in airing their views. Through this series of mobilization efforts, all staff members ideologically clarified the nature, tasks, purpose, and requirements of the third stage of the rectification campaign, thereby unleashing a high tide of airing views. Secondly, the leaders' determination and sincere attitude encouraged the masses to air their views. At the mobilization meeting on November 10th, Minister Zhang Xiruo and Vice-Ministers Dong Chuncai and Chen Zenggu expressed their determination to rectify with a sincere attitude of self-criticism. This enabled many cadres to eliminate their concerns and break through face-saving to offer opinions to their superiors. According to preliminary statistics, the number of cadres at or above the level of director or deputy director of a bureau who have aired their views accounts for more than 70% of the number of cadres at the level of director or deputy director of a bureau participating in the movement. The number of cadres at the section or department level who have aired their views accounts for 91% of the number of cadres at the level of section or department head participating in the movement. 94% of general cadres have aired their views.
    Currently, all have entered a high tide of centralized rectification, and many departments and bureaus have announced rectification matters. The ministry's various special working groups are sorting out and researching the issues raised by everyone. Issues that can be resolved immediately will be resolved immediately. For example, some opinions regarding the organ's lifestyle that can be changed immediately have been resolved. As for more significant issues involving the Ministry of Education's guidelines, policies, business work, and task systems and institutions, they still need to be repeatedly studied before a decision can be made. The Ministry of Education's Rectification Leading Group is urging and inspecting the centralized rectification of various units and calling on everyone to continue to actively air their views.

    掀起鸣放热潮　提出批评建议
　　教育部集中力量进行整改
    本报讯　教育部（包括人民教育出版社等四个直属单位）自11月10日进入整风第三阶段以来，许多工作人员纷纷张贴大字报，对教育部各项工作中的缺点，提出批评和建议。截止11月29日，已有一千二百零八人贴出三千三百零三张大字报，提出意见六千七百七十五条。这些意见主要批评了教育部领导和各个业务司、局工作中的官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义现象和贯彻方针、政策方面的偏差。如部内不少大字报批评了某些党员副部长有严重的脱离实际、脱离群众的官僚主义作风，主管工农教育的党员副部长一次也没有去过工农教育局参加会议，也很少下去检查工作。个别党员副司长把自己的戳子，长期交给主任秘书代签处理公文。人民教育出版社的汉语编辑同志批评党员副社长不常到编辑室进行具体领导。有的大字报批评教育部在学校设置上贯彻阶级路线不够，中学特别是高中多集中在城市，对农民子弟进城上学限制太严，致使学生中工农子弟成分增长比较慢等。此外，大字报中对于机构方面，党、团工作，干部培养，物质福利以及机关中的浪费现象都提出了许多宝贵的意见。这些意见中也包括有积极性的建议，如不少同志对今后在教育工作上如何贯彻阶级路线和精简机构提出了具体方案。出版社有的同志提出编辑部和出版部分开，以便于编辑集中力量编好课本等。
    这次鸣放高潮是和运动开展前一系列的准备工作分不开的。首先，部的领导小组在进行转入第三阶段的准备工作中，根据领导干部和群众的思想情况，反复进行了思想动员。如部领导小组召开了党员司局长会议，不少单位召开了科以上党员干部的会议，使领导干部有引火烧身接受批评的思想准备。同时召开了党员和群众积极分子大会、全体工作人员的动员大会，根据群众的思想情况，一再解除顾虑，并号召党团员和积极分子带头鸣放。经过这一系列的动员工作，使全体工作人员在思想上明确了整风第三阶段的性质、任务、目的、要求，从而掀起鸣放的高潮。其次，领导的决心和诚恳的态度鼓舞了群众鸣放，在11月10日的动员大会上，张奚若部长、董纯才、陈曾固副部长都以诚恳的自我批评的态度，表示了整改的决心。这就使许多干部能消除顾虑，打破情面向顶头上司提意见。据初步统计，司局长级以上干部已鸣放的占参加运动的司局长级干部人数的70％以上，处科级干部已鸣放的占参加运动的处科长级干部的91％。一般干部中有94％的人进行了鸣放。
    目前，全部已投入集中整改的高潮中，不少司局宣布了整改事项。部的各个专题小组正在根据大家提出来的问题分别排队，进行研究。能马上解决的决定立即解决，如对机关生活方面能马上改的一些意见已进行解决。至于涉及到教育部的方针政策、业务工作和任务体制、机构等比较重大的问题，还需要经过反复研究，再作出处理决定。教育部整风领导小组正督促检查各单位集中整改并号召大家继续积极鸣放。
