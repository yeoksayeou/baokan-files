Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 11th: A grand meeting commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Guangzhou Uprising was solemnly held at the Guangzhou Uprising Martyrs' Cemetery on December 11th. Participants in the commemoration included Dong Biwu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and President of the Supreme People's Court, leading members of the Party, government, and military organs of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, people from all walks of life in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, and foreign guests, totaling more than 30,000 people.

The commemoration began with the solemn sounds of the Internationale and the national anthem. Representatives of Party, government, military, and people's organizations, as well as the heads of the consulates of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Vietnam, and Poland in Guangzhou, presented wreaths to the graves of the Guangzhou Uprising martyrs.

After Guangzhou Mayor Zhu Guang delivered the opening speech, Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Chen Yu, Governor of Guangdong Province, who had participated in the Guangzhou Uprising thirty years ago, spoke successively.

Tao Zhu pointed out in his speech that the Guangzhou Uprising, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, with the working class and revolutionary soldiers as the main force, was a heroic action determined to resist the betrayal of the revolution and the brutal rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries by force of arms. It was another bright banner of adhering to the revolutionary struggle erected before the people of the whole country after the Nanchang Uprising and the Autumn Harvest Uprising. However, this uprising, held in the heart of the South, where the power of the imperialist powers was very deep and the rule of the warlords was still very strong, inevitably suffered failure. This educated every Communist Party member and revolutionary that in the difficult situation where the revolution was at a low ebb, the revolutionary forces should advance to the countryside, establish armed base areas, accumulate and develop strength, encircle the cities from the countryside, and finally seize the cities. It was precisely in this way that Comrade Mao Zedong determined the path and the entire set of strategies and tactics that the Chinese revolution should take, turning the Chinese revolution from failure to victory.

Tao Zhu said that in commemorating the Guangzhou Uprising, we must cherish the fruits of the revolution that the revolutionary martyrs exchanged with their heads, resolutely safeguard the people's democratic power and the socialist system; we must learn from the lofty revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary martyrs who dared to sacrifice themselves, work diligently, and build a bright socialist future; we must follow the firm class stand of the revolutionary martyrs in hating all counter-revolutionary factions, mercilessly suppress counter-revolutionary elements who carry out sabotage activities and attempt to counterattack and restore the old order, and resolutely carry the struggle against the anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois reactionaries – the rightists – through to the end.

Chen Yu pointed out in his speech that although the Guangzhou Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government existed for only three days, and its program had not yet been fully implemented at that time, it had declared to the people of the whole country with iron-like facts: the Chinese people can only be completely liberated under the leadership of the Communist Party. Only the revolutionary people's power led by the Communist Party is the power that truly represents the interests of the broad masses of the people and serves the broad masses of the people wholeheartedly.

Chen Yu also said that in the Guangzhou Uprising and in the long-term revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people, the Soviet people gave us sincere and selfless assistance, and the blood of many Soviet comrades flowed together with the blood of the Chinese people. On the occasion of commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Guangzhou Uprising, we express our greatest gratitude and deepest condolences to the Soviet comrades who sacrificed themselves for the Chinese revolution. Olov, the consul of the Soviet Consulate in Guangzhou, also spoke at the commemoration meeting. He said that thirty years ago, the working class in Guangzhou raised the banner of struggle and established its own power, but the domestic reactionaries and their foreign protectors—British, American, Japanese, French, and other imperialists—drowned the Guangzhou Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government in the blood of the working people. In this massacre, they exposed their bestial hatred for the Chinese working class who were striving for the freedom and independence of their motherland. Only the Soviet Union understood the revolutionary actions of the working people of Guangzhou and their initial victory with warm sympathy.

Olov concluded by saying that in order to commemorate the staff members of the Soviet Consulate in Guangzhou who were killed by the counter-revolutionary forces under trumped-up charges after the failure of the Guangzhou Uprising, the Sino-Soviet Blood Friendship Pavilion was built in the Guangzhou Uprising Martyrs' Cemetery. This is a manifestation of the Chinese people's lofty internationalist feelings and deep respect for the Soviet Union. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks here on behalf of the Soviet people. At the end of his speech, Olov presented a red flag with the words "Dedicated to the Glorious Working Class of Guangzhou" on behalf of the Soviet Consulate in Guangzhou to the meeting.

The people who attended the commemoration finally visited the Guangzhou Uprising Martyrs' Cemetery and admired the Sino-Soviet Blood Friendship Pavilion.

While the commemoration was held, the actual situation of the meeting was broadcast to the general public of Guangzhou by the radio station, and leaflets of the commemoration were distributed to the citizens by plane.

　　纪念广州起义三十周年
    广东三万多人举行大会
    新华社广州11日电　广州起义三十周年纪念大会11日在广州起义烈士陵园隆重举行。参加纪念大会的，有中共中央政治局委员、最高人民法院院长董必武，广东省、广州市党、政、军领导机关负责人，广东省、广州市各界人士和外国来宾总共三万多人。
    纪念大会在奏国际歌和国歌的庄严的乐声中开始；参加大会的党、政、军、人民团体的代表和苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、越南、波兰等国驻广州领事馆负责人，向广州起义烈士墓献了花圈。
    在广州市长朱光致开会词以后，曾经参加三十年前广州起义的中共广东省委第一书记陶铸、广东省省长陈郁相继讲话。
    陶铸在讲话中指出，广州起义是在中国共产党领导下，以工人阶级和革命士兵为主力军，决心以武力反抗国民党反动派叛变革命和残酷统治的一次英勇的行动。它是继南昌起义和秋收起义之后，又一次在全国人民面前树立起来的一面鲜明的坚持革命斗争的旗帜。但这次起义在帝国主义列强势力十分深厚、军阀统治还很强大的南方心脏举行，不可避免的遭到了失败。这就教育了每个共产党员和革命者，在当时革命处于低潮的困难局势下，革命力量应该向农村进军，建立武装根据地，借以积蓄和发展力量，由农村包围城市，并最后夺取城市。毛泽东同志正是这样的确定了中国革命所应走的道路和整套的战略、策略，使中国革命由失败转向胜利。
    陶铸说，纪念广州起义，我们必须十分珍惜革命先烈以头颅换来的革命果实，坚决维护人民民主政权和社会主义制度；必须学习革命先烈勇于自我牺牲的崇高的革命精神，勤勤恳恳的工作，建设社会主义的美好未来；必须效法革命先烈那样仇恨一切反革命派的坚定的阶级立场，毫不留情地镇压进行破坏活动、企图反攻复辟的反革命分子，把对反党、反社会主义的资产阶级反动派——右派分子的斗争坚决进行到底。
    陈郁在讲话中指出，广州工农民主政府虽然只存在了三天，当时它的政纲没有来得及全部实现，但是，它已经用铁一般的事实向全国人民宣告：中国人民只有在共产党领导下才能彻底解放。只有共产党领导的革命的人民政权，才是真正代表广大人民利益的全心全意为广大人民服务的政权。
    陈郁还说，在广州起义中，在中国人民长期的革命斗争中，苏联人民给了我们诚挚的无私的援助，许多苏联同志的鲜血和中国人民的鲜血流在一起。纪念广州起义三十周年，我们向为中国革命牺牲的苏联同志致以最大的感激和最深切的悼念。苏联驻广州领事馆领事鄂洛夫也在纪念大会上讲了话。他说，三十年前，广州的工人阶级举起了斗争的旗帜，并建立了自己的政权，但是国内的反动派和他们国外的庇护者——英、美、日、法等帝国主义把广州工农民主政权溺杀在劳动人民的血泊中。在这次屠杀中，暴露了它们对于争取自己祖国的自由和独立的中国工人阶级有了野兽般的仇恨。只有苏联，才怀着热烈的同情，来理解广州劳动人民的革命举动以及他们最初的胜利。
    鄂洛夫最后说，为了纪念广州起义失败后被反革命势力以莫须有罪名杀害的苏联驻广州领事馆工作人员，而在广州起义烈士陵园建立了中苏血谊亭，这是中国人民的崇高的国际主义感情和对苏联深切尊敬的情谊的表现，我在这里代表苏联人民表示衷心的感谢。鄂洛夫在讲话结束时，代表苏联驻广州领事馆向大会献了一面写有“献给光荣的广州工人阶级”字样的红旗。
    参加纪念大会的人们最后参谒了广州起义烈士墓，并瞻仰了中苏血谊亭。
    在举行纪念大会的同时，大会的实况由广播电台向广州广大市民转播，并且由飞机向市民散发了纪念大会的传单。
