　　All Depends on Our Diligent Hands
　　By Our Correspondent　Yan Ling
　　"More public property will solidify cooperatives like reinforced concrete; otherwise, they will easily scatter like a pile of sand."
　　Many cooperative members and cadres sincerely hope that their cooperative will be like reinforced concrete, not a pile of sand. However, they don’t fully understand how to achieve this.
　　The total income of Yangliuqing Shuangqi Agricultural Cooperative this year is more than 420,000 yuan, an increase of nearly one-third compared to last year. When they initially formulated the income distribution plan, they only intended to extract 7% of the annual net income for the public accumulation fund. It was estimated that each member could receive an average of more than 170 yuan, nearly 36% more than last year. This was already a great improvement compared to last year (last year, the cooperative's total income was 320,000 yuan, with the public accumulation fund accounting for 3% of the total income). But, was it possible to further strengthen the cooperative's foundation?
　　In the great debate on the two roads, after the members recognized the superiority of the advanced cooperative, they further explored the reasons for increased production and transitioned into a great debate on production and construction. After initial discussions, everyone realized that public accumulation should be further expanded, and individual income of members did not need to increase so much at once. They initially decided to extract more than 13% of the net income for the public accumulation fund, reducing the average income of each member to about 150 yuan, which was still more than 19% higher than last year. According to the initial decision, the portion retained for agricultural tax, public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, plus the actual production expenses and management fees spent this year (including repayment of state loans), accounted for about 40% of this year's total income, and the portion directly distributed to members accounted for about 60%. They are still further refining their calculations to see if they can further expand public accumulation, planning to expand the retained portion to account for 45%-50% of the total income. By doing so, it is estimated that the income of members can still increase compared to last year.
　　This is good news. Upon hearing this, I went to this agricultural cooperative to investigate: How did the cooperative's public accumulation expand as the members' level of awareness increased?
　　What's going on here?
　　Following the canal, I found the Shuangqi Cooperative and its director, Wang Jingquan. After he understood my purpose, he took me to the newly built house next to their threshing ground to talk:
　　“The year before last, we were still a primary cooperative with twenty-eight households. At that time, every member worked very happily, and we ourselves felt that we were doing pretty well. However, compared with the past two years of running an advanced cooperative, especially compared with this year, the members felt that even though they worked hard back then, the increase in production and income was very limited. Now, they don't feel particularly tired, yet the increase in production and income is faster and greater than back then. We cooperative cadres feel more comfortable running this large cooperative with hundreds of households than when we ran the small cooperative. What's going on? …
　　“In the spring and summer, when some members of other cooperatives were fiercely demanding to withdraw from the cooperative, only one household in our cooperative withdrew. They were from a rich peasant background and left to do petty trading. Shuangqi Cooperative's high income has made it famous within a radius of dozens of miles. Many people want to move here to settle down, and many girls want to marry into our cooperative. It’s really good, that's not fake at all. But, how did things get so good in the past two years? How can we do better? Can we further increase production? In the past, even the members and some cadres of our cooperative couldn’t figure it out…”
　　Comrade Wang Jingquan was very interested in the topics I proposed and, once he started, talked enthusiastically. He said that the members were amazed and somewhat doubtful about the speed of production increase in recent years during the previous period of the great debate, and they almost didn't believe they were capable of such great achievements. Many members just felt that the advanced cooperative was good, with high output and high income, but they couldn't explain why for a while. Many members believed that since the cooperative's income was high, it should be distributed as much as possible to the members. Some members felt that this was not right. Therefore, the debate on production and construction unfolded following the "stubble" of the previous stage of the great debate.
　　Strength Used in the Right Place
　　“In the debate, everyone came to realize that the main reason for the increase in production was that the strength of the agricultural cooperative was used in the right place, turning barren and low-lying land into rice paddies, and dry land into irrigated land and vegetable gardens. Everyone calculated the accounts: alkali land and low-lying land where no crops grew in the past, when planted with rice, could yield several hundred catties per mu in the first year; later, the soil quality improved, and the yield could be further increased. Upland cotton, even with a bumper harvest, only yields more than two hundred catties of seed cotton per mu; converted into irrigated land, at least four hundred catties per mu can be harvested. A superior dry land field, even with a good harvest, generates income equivalent to just over thirty yuan a year; converted into a garden field, a mu of land can generate an annual income equivalent to five or six hundred yuan. …
　　“Speaking of the matter of turning low-lying land into rice paddies, some members didn't believe it at first! This year, we planted two hundred and fifty mu of rice in the eastern low-lying area (Jinxi Lowland), and the average yield in the first year was eight hundred catties of rice per mu. Of this, seventy mu averaged one thousand one hundred catties per mu. When we first started debating the reasons for the increase in production, the rice hadn't been harvested yet. Some people didn't believe it, so I suggested that they go to the fields to see for themselves. I first led them to the barren land that hadn't been planted with rice, where the ground was covered with a thick layer of white alkali, and walking on it was like walking on snow. I said: Look everyone, can this land grow crops? Many people said: This land, nothing can be harvested even if you plant it! I then led them to the side of our rice paddy. Separated by a ridge only two feet wide, on one side was the alkali wasteland, and on the other side was the rice paddy. When they saw the rice paddy, they said: Wow! This rice is really good! The member in charge of watering there told them: This rice paddy used to look the same as the alkali wasteland over there. … First, they looked at a patch of more than thirty mu, and then walked to the ridge where another piece of wasteland and rice paddy met. Some members stood on the ridge, looking at this side, looking at that side, lost in thought. Someone said: This place really grows rice! Someone said: After seeing this, I am convinced! An old man said: Where else is there? I still want to see it, the more I see it, the more I love it. We originally said we would only look for two hours, but in the end, we didn't come back until very late. …
　　“Thinking about the matter of planting rice, it's really infuriating! It’s so difficult to break the conservative thinking of some members. At the time of sowing and transplanting, no matter how many good words you said, some people still couldn't understand and cursed everywhere. After visiting the rice paddy, those members who used to curse all took the initiative to do self-criticism. Everyone unanimously agreed: Next year, we will expand the rice paddy by more than four hundred mu in the Lianhua Lake Lowland, and the first year's yield will be seven hundred catties per mu (the soil quality is not as good as Jinxi Lowland). Next year, the cooperative will harvest more than six hundred thousand catties of rice alone. We also discussed how much the yield of other crops could be increased, plot by plot. Averaging them together, the yield of grain per mu will definitely exceed four hundred catties. We also need to expand the irrigated land to further increase the yield of cotton. The big cities are asking us to supply more vegetables, so we also need to expand the garden land by another eighty mu. In order not to hinder the increase in grain production, the garden land cannot be expanded too much, so we need to find ways to make the existing garden land have harvests in all four seasons. In this way, what the members eat and use will be much better than what the rich middle peasants used to have. … At the meeting, as they talked and calculated, the members all smiled.”
　　Having Money is Not Enough, You Have to Know How to Spend It
　　Of course, just being happy is still empty. We also need to figure out how to expand rice paddies, irrigated land, and vegetable gardens, how to increase yields, and how to harvest an extra season. Comrade Wang Jingquan told me that the members debated these issues again. In the end, there was no other trick, we still have to build water conservancy, accumulate more fertilizer, and add some machinery and other equipment.
　　“Machines are really useful! Our production has expanded so much in the past two years, and the members don't feel as tired as they used to. What's the reason? We figured it out during the debate. The most important thing is to expand public accumulation and add machines. When we ran the primary cooperative, public accumulation was very small, we couldn't afford machines, and we couldn't afford to build water conservancy. Using a small waterwheel to irrigate the land, one person and one animal can't irrigate more than two mu of garden in a day. Last year, we bought a gas engine, and using it to pump water, we can irrigate thirty mu in a day, and it only takes one person to watch it. This year, we added three more gas engines, and also installed two electric pumping machines, and also bought some threshers and shellers. Each electric pumping machine can irrigate nearly one hundred mu in a day, and it still only requires one person to take care of it; it can also drive rice milling and shelling machines. In addition to pumping water, the gas engine can also drive a thresher to thresh rice and a straw cutter to cut grass, which is both more labor-saving and more productive than in the past. — The machines are constantly running, and people working next to the machines are also particularly energetic. Look, those people threshing rice on the field outside are working so happily!”
　　“Having money is not enough, you also have to know how to spend it. Last year, the total income was 320,000 yuan, and the cooperative's expenses were about 130,000 yuan, but not much public property was purchased. What about this year? The cooperative's total income increased by more than 100,000 yuan compared to last year, but expenses decreased by 30,000 yuan compared to last year, and much more public property was purchased than last year. At first, when talking about this issue at the debate meeting, everyone also found it quite strange. After discussing and analyzing, it turned out that the cooperative's fertilizer accumulation work was done too poorly last year, and too much money was spent on buying fertilizer. This year, the cooperative and the members raised more pigs and sheep, and accumulated more fertilizer, so fertilizer expenses were reduced, and most of the money was used for capital construction.
　　“Over there is our livestock farm…” Wang Jingquan pointed to the west of the threshing ground and took me there. There was a row of sheep pens, and several rows of pig pens, most of which were newly built this year. He said: Now, the cooperative and the members raise a total of more than two hundred pigs. The cooperative raises thirty-five sows, which can give birth to about five hundred piglets a year. There are now more than one hundred and thirty sheep, and some are pregnant and can give birth to sixty or seventy lambs before the Lunar New Year; next year, they can give birth to more than three hundred lambs. The cooperative and the members don't need to go elsewhere to buy piglets and lambs. There is also no shortage of feed. They have plenty of vegetable scraps, radish leaves, and sweet potato stalks, and there are also many wild grasses and wild vegetables in the area that can be used as feed.
　　After the debate, the members unanimously guaranteed: No fertilizer will be bought next year. Many people signed up to participate in the winter fertilizer accumulation team. They use various methods to accumulate more than forty cartloads of fertilizer a day (one cartload is about one thousand five hundred catties). This team will be active until the end of February next year, let's see how much fertilizer they can accumulate!
　　To the west of the newly built pigsty is a large pit filled with water, covered with dry lotus leaves. Wang Jingquan said to me: "You came late! In the summer, it's full of lotus flowers, so beautiful. This pit is more than ten mu in size, and for many years it has just been a stinky pit, which is only harmful to people and not beneficial. This year, we have electric pumping machines, and we pumped in good water and planted lotus roots. In the first year, we can harvest three thousand catties of lotus root per mu; fish can also be raised in the water. There are also sixty or seventy mu of barren land to the south, and we plan to plant grapes, apples, pear trees, and jujube trees next year….”
　　Where Does the Funding Come From?
　　"To further expand rice paddies and irrigated land, we need to add more pumping machines; to plant an extra season in the garden land, we need to add more than a thousand glass windows for warm greenhouses; to raise more pigs and sheep, we need to build more pens; if we produce more vegetables, the rubber-wheeled carts are not enough, so we need to add more; planting lotus roots, raising fish, and planting fruit trees all require investment. Where does the funding come from? This question was raised at the debate meeting, and the members argued again. Someone remembered that the National Bank gave us a loan of seven thousand yuan last year. At that time, the advanced cooperative had just been established, and this loan solved many of our problems. This loan has been repaid this year, and someone still wanted to apply for another loan. Most of the members disagreed. Someone said: Our cooperative's income has increased so much, we can't add any more burden to the country. Someone said: Let's calculate, how much interest do we have to pay for a loan of five thousand yuan a year! Someone said: When we were distributing the profits after the autumn harvest last year, everyone asked the cooperative to deduct less and distribute more, and as a result, after deducting the cooperative's expenses from last year, the cooperative didn't have much money left. Fortunately, we have a vegetable garden, and we often sell and spend the money every day. In this way, it's impossible to carry out any larger construction projects in a planned way. In the end, everyone unanimously agreed that the cooperative's retained portion this year should account for at least 40% of the total income. In this way, after deducting the actual expenses of more than 100,000 yuan this year, there will still be more than 60,000 yuan left, and the production construction in this winter and next spring will be easy to handle." All depends on our diligent hands!
　　When you have more money, you must not forget to be diligent and thrifty. To start a family and build a career, the most important thing is diligence, you must rely on your own labor. The cadres and members of the Shuangqi Cooperative have a firm grasp on this point. Many members have learned to do carpentry work, and this year they have also added members with blacksmithing skills. Wang Jingquan pointed to a large area of new houses and told me: "Dozens of warehouses, farm tool warehouses, and livestock sheds were all built with our own efforts! … Carts, seeders, plows, and harrows used to have to be repaired by others, which was expensive, inconvenient, and untimely. Now, we repair them whenever they break, and we make new ones whenever we need them, saving a lot of money!"
　　"To expand rice paddies, it's not enough to just have money to buy pumping machines, we also need to see if we have enough labor! — At the debate meeting, someone still doubted planting more rice and raised this question. We calculated it and found that we were indeed short of more than 30,000 workdays. What should we do? … If we mobilize the masses to find solutions, there's no problem that can't be solved. Everyone came up with a solution: There were still quite a few cases of loafing and absenteeism in the past; some members haven't fully exerted their strength, and some people aren't working as hard as they did when they were working individually! Someone said: If we continue to work like that in the future, we definitely won't have enough labor. Someone said: If everyone boosts their enthusiasm for building socialism, gets up a few minutes earlier every day, rests a few minutes later, and works half an hour more a day, eight hundred laborers can produce tens of thousands more workdays a year. As soon as this idea was put forward, many members shouted: 'This, we can do it!' … The members made suggestions during the great debate, asking the cooperative cadres to participate more in production; this, our cooperative cadres can also do!"
　　We walked along the canal again to see their electric pumping equipment. I found that on very steep river slopes (it seems that the slope is at least fifty degrees), they also planted kohlrabi, radishes, and other vegetables, which are growing quite well! — As long as our hands are diligent, how lovely can we make our land, how much nourishment can we create to make people's lives fuller! I seemed to see many pairs of strong and powerful hands again: Hands opening canals, hands dumping manure, hands threshing rice, hands picking cotton, hands sowing seeds, hands cultivating, … and many hands raised high in the members' congress, unanimously agreeing to increase the public accumulation fund from 3% to more than 13%, unanimously agreeing to increase the unit yield of grain to more than four hundred catties, five hundred catties. With these many diligent and powerful hands, how quickly can we advance our socialist cause! (Attached pictures)

　　全靠我们勤劳的双手
　　本报记者　燕凌
    “有了较多的公共财产，才会使合作社像钢骨水泥般地巩固起来，否则会像沙堆一样容易散掉。”
    许多社员和社干部也满心希望自己的社像钢骨水泥一样，而不是像一堆沙子。可是，他们却并不十分了解怎样才能做到这一点。
    杨柳青双旗农业社今年的总收入合四十二万多元，比去年提高了将近三分之一。他们在最初制订收益分配方案的时候，却只打算从全年纯收入中抽出7％做公积金；预计社员每人平均可以分一百七十多元，比去年多将近36％。这比起去年来，是已经大有改进了（去年这个社的总收入是三十二万元，公积金占总收入的3％）；可是，能不能把社里的家底铺得更厚一些呢？
    在两条道路的大辩论中，社员们认识了高级社的优越性以后，进一步追寻增产的原因，转入了关于生产建设的大辩论。经过初步辩论，大家认清了应该把公共积累更扩大一些，社员个人的收入不必一下子增加得这么多。他们初步决定从纯收入当中提取13％以上的公积金；社员每人平均收入减为一百五十元左右，比去年仍然提高了19％以上。按初步决定的数目，农业税、公积金、公益金加上今年实际花出的生产费和管理费（包括归还国家贷款），扣留部分大约占今年总收入的40％，直接分给社员的部分大约占60％。他们还在进一步精打细算，看能不能再多扩大一些公共积累，打算把扣留部分扩大到占总收入的45％—50％。这样做，估计社员的收入仍然可以比去年增加。
    这是一个好消息。听到这个消息，我就到这个农业社去访问：社里的公共积累是怎样随着社员觉悟水平的提高而扩大的？
    这是怎么回事？
    沿着运河走去，找到了双旗社，找到了社主任王景泉。他了解了我的来意，就把我带到他们的打谷场旁边新建的房子里谈起来了：
      “前年，我们还是个二十八户的初级社。那会儿，个个社员都干得挺欢，我们自己也觉着干得挺不错。可是，同办了高级社这两年比，特别是同今年比起来，社员们就觉得那会儿拚命地干，产量和收入增加得也很有限；这会儿也不觉得怎么累，产量和收入却比那会儿增加得又快又多。我们社干部办这个几百户的大社，也反而觉得比办小社的时候爽快一些。这是怎么回事？……
    “春天，夏天，别的社一些社员闹退社闹得顶凶的时候，我们社里只有一户退社的，是富农成分，退社做小买卖去了。双旗社收入多，在方圆几十里以内都出了名。很多人想搬到我们这里来落户，很多姑娘想嫁到我们社里来。好倒是真好，一点也不假。可是，到底这两年是怎么好起来的？怎样才能办得更好？还能不能更多地增加生产？过去，连我们社里的社员和一些社干部也弄不清楚。……”
    王景泉同志对于我提出来的访问题目很感兴趣，说开了头，就兴致勃勃地谈了下去。他说：社员们前一个时期在大辩论中怎样为这几年生产增加的速度而惊疑，简直自己也有点儿不相信自己怎么有这样大的本领；许多社员光觉得高级社好，产量高，收入多；为什么，却一时说不清。许多社员认为：既然社里的收入多，就应该尽量多分给社员。有些社员却感觉到这样做不对头。于是，关于生产建设的辩论就接着前一阶段的大辩论的“茬口”展开了。
      力量用到了正地方
    “在辩论会上，说来说去，大家都认识到了：增产的原因，最主要的是把农业社的力量用到了正地方，把荒洼地改成了稻田，把旱地改成了水浇地和菜园。大家算了一下账：过去什么庄稼也不长的碱地、洼地，种上稻子，头一年每亩就能收几百斤；往后土质越变越好，产量还能提高。旱地棉花，丰产了，一亩地也才收二百多斤籽棉；改成水浇地，一亩地至少收四百多斤。一亩拔尖的好旱地，收成好，一年的收入不过折合三十多元；改成园田，一亩地一年的收入能折合五六百元。……
      “说起洼地改稻田的事，起初有些社员还不相信呢！今年我们在东边的洼地（津西洼）种了二百五十亩稻子，头一年每亩平均就收了八百斤稻谷。这里边有七十亩，每亩平均收了一千一百斤。在刚开始辩论增产原因的时候，稻子还没有收割。有些人不相信，我就提议请他们去地里参观参观。我先把他们领到还没有种稻子的荒地上去，那里满地是多厚的一层白白的盐碱，走着就像走在雪地上一样。我说：你们大伙看看，这地能不能长庄稼？许多人说：这地，种什么也收不了！我就把他们领到我们的稻田旁边去。隔着两尺来宽的地埂子，一边就是碱荒地，一边就是稻田。他们一看见稻田，就说：嗬！这稻子真好！在那里管水的社员告诉他们：这稻田原先同那边的碱荒地是一个样子。……先看了三十多亩的一块，走到了另一边荒地和稻田交界的埂子上。一些社员站在埂子上，看看这边，看看那边，看得出神了。有人说：这地方真长稻子啊！有人说：我这一看，算服气了！一个老汉说：还有哪一块？我还想看看，越看越爱。本来说只看两个钟头，末了到天很晚才回来。……
    “想起种稻子的事，也真气人！一些社员的保守思想真难打破。播种的时候，插秧的时候，你把多少好话都说完了，有些人还是思想不通，到处骂街。参观稻田回来，那些过去骂街的社员，都自动检讨起来了。全体一致同意：明年要在莲花淀洼地再扩大稻田四百多亩，第一年每亩要收七百斤（土质不如津西洼）。明年，全社光稻谷就要收获六十来万斤。别的作物，也分开一段地一段地都讨论了可以提高多少产量。放在一起平均算，粮食每亩产量一定能够超过四百斤。还要扩大水浇地，把棉花的产量也再提高一步。大城市要求我们供应更多的蔬菜，园田也要再扩大八十亩。为了不妨碍增产粮食，园田不能扩大太多，要想办法使现有的园田一年四季都有收成。这样，社员们吃的、用的，就要比过去的富裕中农还要好得多。……在会上，说着，算着，社员们都笑了。”
      有钱，还得会花
    当然，光高兴，还是空的。还得弄清楚，到底怎样才能扩大稻田、水浇地和菜园，怎样才能提高产量，怎样才能多收一季。王景泉同志告诉我，社员们对这些问题又辩论了一通。说来说去，没有别的巧法，还是要兴修水利、多积肥料，还要增添一些机器和别的设备。
    “机器，真顶事啊！我们的生产这两年扩大了这么多，社员们还觉得不比过去累得慌，原因在哪儿？在辩论中间弄清楚啦，顶重要的一件事就是扩大公共积累，添了机器。办初级小社的时候，公共积累很少，买不起机器，修不起水利。用小水车浇地，一个人一头牲口一天浇不了二亩园。去年买了一个煤气机，用它抽水，一天能浇三十亩，也只要一个人看着它。今年，又添了三个煤气机，还装了两座电力抽水机，又买了些脱谷机、去壳机。电力抽水机每座一天能浇近一百亩，还是只需要一个人看管；它还能带舂米的去壳机。煤气机除了抽水还能带动脱谷机打稻子，还能带动铡草机铡草，都比过去又省力又出活。——机器不停地转，人在机器旁边做活也就特别加劲，你看，外边场上正在打稻子的那些人干得多欢！”
    “有钱也还得看会花不会花。去年，总收入是三十二万元，社里的开支大约十三万元，可是置买的公共财物却不多。今年呢？社里的总收入比去年增加了十来万元，开支却比去年减少了三万来元，置买的公共财物比去年多得多。起初，在辩论会上谈到这件事，大家也觉得挺奇怪。一讨论，一分析，原来是去年社里积肥工作做得太差，在买肥料方面用的钱太多了。今年，社里和社员们多养了猪羊，多攒了肥料，肥料开支少了，大部分钱都用到基本建设上了。
      “那边就是我们的养畜场……”王景泉指了一指打谷场西边，把我带到那里去。那里有一排羊圈，好几排猪圈，大部分是今年新建的。他说：现在，社里的和社员自己喂的总共有二百多头猪。社里养了三十五头母猪，一年大约能生五百头小猪。羊，现在已经有一百三十多头，有些正怀着胎，旧历年前还能生六七十头小羊；明年一年，能再生三百多头小羊。社里和社员都用不着到别处去买猪娃羊羔。饲料也不缺，他们有的是菜帮子、萝卜叶、山芋梗，当地还有不少野草野菜可以当饲料。
    社员们经过辩论以后，一致保证：明年一点肥料也不买。很多人报名参加冬季积肥队，他们用各种办法，一天能积肥四十多车（一车大约一千五百斤）。这个队要活动到明年2月底为止，看能积攒多少肥料！
    在新建的猪舍西边，是一大片水坑，水上满是干枯的荷叶。王景泉对我说：“你来晚啦！夏天满都是荷花，真好看。这个水坑有十几亩大，过去多少年来就只是臭水坑，对人光有害处没有好处。今年有了电力抽水机，灌进去了好水，栽上了藕，头一年每亩就能收藕三千斤；水里还可以养鱼。南边还有六七十亩荒地，明年打算栽上葡萄、苹果、梨树、枣树……。”
        资金从哪儿来？
    “要再扩大稻田、水浇地，就要再添置抽水机；园田要多种一季，就要再添一千来扇盖暖窖用的玻璃窗；再多养猪羊，还要多修圈；生产的菜多了，胶轮大车不够用，也要添置；种藕、养鱼、栽果树，也都得下本钱。资金从哪儿来？在辩论会上扯出了这个问题，社员们又争论起来了。有人想起来去年国家银行给我们贷款七千来元。那时候高级社刚办起来，这笔款子给我们解决了不少难题。这笔贷款今年已经还了，有人就还想再要求贷款。大多数社员不同意。有人说：我们社里收入增加了这么多，不能再给国家添负担。有人说：算算吧，贷五千元一年得出多少息呀！有人说：去年秋后分配的时候大家都要求社里少扣多分，结果扣了去年社里的消耗，社里就没剩下什么钱来。幸好有菜园子，今年常常是日卖日花。这样，要有计划地搞些比较大的建设就不行。最后，大家一致同意今年社里扣留部分至少占总收入的40％。这样，除掉今年实际消耗的十来万元，还有六万来元，今冬和明春的生产建设就好办了。”全靠勤劳的双手！
    钱多了也不能忘记勤俭。兴家立业，顶要紧的是勤，要靠自己的劳动。双旗社的干部和社员对这一点都掌握得很紧。许多社员学会了做木匠活，今年又添了有铁匠手艺的社员。王景泉指着一大片新房子告诉我：“几十间仓库、农具库、牲口棚，都是用我们自己的力量盖起来的！……车、耧、犁、耙，过去要找别人给修，又费钱，又不方便、不及时。现在，什么时候坏就什么时候修，什么时候需要新的就什么时候做，省钱省多啦！”
    “扩大稻田，光有钱买抽水机也不行，还得看劳动力够不够呀！——在辩论会上，有人对多种水稻还是怀疑，提出了这个问题。我们计算了一下，的确还缺三万多个工。怎么办呢？……发动群众想办法，就没有没办法的事。大家研究了出来：过去窝工、旷工的情形还是不少；有些社员的力气也还没有完全使出来，有的人还没单干的时候卖力气大呢！有人说：以后要还是那样干，劳动力的确是不够。有人说：要是大家都把建设社会主义的劲头鼓足，每天早起十几分钟，晚休息十几分钟，一个人一天多干半个小时，八百多个劳动力，一年就能多出几万个工。这个主意一拿出来，很多社员就喊了起来：‘这，能做到！’……社员们在大辩论中间提意见，要求社干部更多参加生产；这，我们社干部也能做得到！”
    我们又沿着运河走去，去看他们的电力抽水设备。我发现，在很陡的河岸斜坡上（看样子，坡度至少也有五十度），他们也种上了苤蓝、萝卜等等蔬菜，长得还挺不错呢！——双手只要勤劳，能使我们的大地变得多么可爱，能创造出来多少使人们的生命更加丰满的养料！我眼前仿佛又出现了许多双强壮有力的手：正在开渠的双手，正在倒粪的双手，正在打稻子的双手，正在拣棉花的双手，正在播种的双手，正在耕耘的双手，……还有在社员大会上高高举起的，一致同意把公积金由3％提高到13％以上的许多手，一致同意把粮食单位产量提高到四百斤、五百斤以上的许多手。有这许多许多勤劳的有力的手，能把我们的社会主义事业多么快地向前推进啊！（附图片）
