Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 28th - The first generating unit of Yunnan Province's largest automated thermal power plant, the Kunming Power Plant, began generating electricity on the 26th.

    The Kunming Power Plant was newly built to meet the needs of Yunnan's industrial construction and development. The entire project includes four generating units, with a total power generation capacity about 50% greater than the current total power generation of the entire Kunming power grid. Once fully installed and put into production, the shortage of electricity for industrial use in Kunming can be fundamentally changed. All the equipment for the power plant was designed and manufactured with the assistance of Czechoslovakia, and the entire production process is operated using instruments and buttons. Due to the high thermal efficiency of this power plant, it is estimated that it can save nearly 100,000 tons of raw coal per year compared to Kunming's existing old-fashioned power plants.
    Construction of the Kunming Power Plant began in May of last year. In the process of construction, the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" was implemented; in May of this year alone, a single adjustment to the construction project saved the state more than 1.8 million yuan in funds.

    昆明发电厂开始发电
    新华社昆明28日电　云南省最大的自动化火力发电厂——昆明发电厂第一机组26日开始发电。
    昆明电厂是为适应云南工业建设发展的需要而新建的。全部工程包括四个机组，总发电量比目前整个昆明电力网发电量的总和还大50％左右；全部安装完成投入生产以后，昆明工业用电不足的状况就可以根本改变。电厂的全部设备都是捷克斯洛伐克帮助设计和制造的，整个生产过程都使用仪表和电钮操纵。由于这个电厂的热效率很高，根据折算，每年可以比昆明现有的旧式电厂节省原煤近十万吨。
    昆明电厂是去年5月动工兴建的。在建设过程中，贯彻了多、快、好、省的方针；仅今年5月份一次调整建设项目，就为国家节省资金达一百八十多万元。
