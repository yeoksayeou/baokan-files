Xinhua News Agency, Guanzhuang, December 21st. The central state organs stationed in Guanzhuang convened a Workers' Representative Conference from the 19th to the 21st. Mobilizing the masses, they continued to focus on rectification to eliminate the chaotic situation in Guanzhuang. At the meeting, the resolution "Strengthen Unified Management of Guanzhuang Organs, Thoroughly Eliminate the Chaotic Situation in Guanzhuang" was unanimously passed.

More than 800 worker representatives and observers attended the meeting.

At the meeting, Su Jiguang, Director of the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry and Secretary of the Guanzhuang Party Committee, delivered a report entitled "We Must Mobilize and Fight to Eliminate the 'Free Kingdom' – the Chaotic Situation in Guanzhuang." He said that the "free kingdom" is a concrete manifestation of disorganization, indiscipline, and anarchism, and is incompatible with socialism. This chaotic situation is mainly manifested in: each acting on its own, disregarding the overall situation, such as adopting an irresponsible attitude of "pushing away if possible" and "dodging if possible" towards public undertakings; staff members of various units also look down on each other due to varying degrees of departmentalism; social order is chaotic, and illegal and undisciplined behaviors occur constantly. Su Jiguang analyzed that the main reasons for this chaotic situation are the bureaucracy of the leaders of various units, the long-standing tendency to neglect politics, and serious departmentalism.

In his report, Su Jiguang emphasized continuing to deepen airing views and debates, doing a good job in rectification, and launching a struggle against the tendency to neglect politics and against departmentalism.

Zeng Yifan, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council and leader of the Five-Person Working Group, also spoke at the meeting. The focus of his speech was concentrated on strengthening unified leadership and unified management; and strengthening political and ideological work. He said that in order to better adapt to the tasks of socialist construction in the future, the various state organs stationed in Guanzhuang, in addition to continuing to vigorously carry out rectification and overcome bureaucracy, should first gradually unify the issues that each unit should and can manage centrally, and eliminate the anarchic state of non-cooperation and each acting on its own between units. Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the political and ideological work of the Party, the Communist Youth League, the masses, and family members, and conduct socialist legal system education, discipline education, and collectivism education among the staff, and thoroughly overcome departmentalism and the tendency to neglect politics.

Lai Jifa, Minister of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, said in his speech at the meeting that he asked everyone to act together on the basis of unified understanding, to fight against bad people, bad deeds, and all undesirable phenomena, and resolutely transform Guanzhuang into an orderly and well-led new Guanzhuang.

At the meeting, the representatives unanimously agreed that the above reports and speeches helped them clearly understand the seriousness and harm of the chaotic situation in Guanzhuang, thereby increasing their confidence and determination to overcome these chaotic phenomena. Representatives from various units, in the spirit of strictly examining themselves and self-criticism, exposed many facts of neglecting political inclination and departmentalism, and put forward many suggestions for improvement to the meeting. The representatives also angrily exposed and accused some lawless, undisciplined, and morally corrupt bad elements, and demanded that the leadership deal with them seriously and conscientiously.

The meeting representatives, the presidents and vice-presidents of various design institutes and research institutes, also criticized at the meeting that their neglect of political work, right-leaning emotions, and serious departmentalism had caused superiors to imitate inferiors, making the entire Guanzhuang full of an atmosphere of not caring about politics and sectarianism, and also made various chaotic phenomena and illegal and undisciplined behaviors unable to be resolved and dealt with in a timely manner.

The representatives attending the meeting expressed great welcome to the spirit of self-criticism adopted by the responsible comrades of various institutes and offices at the meeting, and expressed that they would resolutely take action to eliminate these chaotic phenomena.

At the meeting, the "Resolution to Thoroughly Eliminate the Chaotic Situation in Guanzhuang" was unanimously passed. The resolution is as follows:

(1) Launch a struggle against the tendency to neglect politics and departmentalism, thoroughly change the chaotic situation of the "free kingdom" through the rectification movement, improve the socialist thinking of state organ staff, and further improve the work of state organs.

(2) Establish a patriotic health campaign committee, carry out a mass movement of "paying attention to hygiene and eliminating the four pests," and do a good job in the cleaning and sanitation of Guanzhuang.

(3) Rectify social order and resolutely crack down on criminals.

(4) In order to strengthen the relationship between the central government and local governments and the local people, formulate four covenants: (1) Exemplarily abide by and implement all policies, laws, regulations, and systems of the local government; (2) Protect the interests of the masses and shall not damage a single crop or break a single tree; (3) Respect local customs, especially the customs of the Hui people; (4) Participate in agricultural production voluntary labor in a planned and arranged manner. At the same time, formulate six covenants among the staff and family members: (1) Take good care of public property and cherish state property; (2) Love labor and live frugally; (3) Eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, and achieve "everyone pays attention to hygiene, every family loves cleanliness"; (4) Live in harmony with neighbors and strengthen unity and mutual assistance; (5) Strengthen family education for children and cultivate children's virtues of loving the people, loving science, loving the motherland, loving labor, and protecting public property; (6) Conduct education on unhealthy thoughts and bad behaviors among family members.

(5) Strengthen the leadership of organ work, overcome bureaucracy, adhere to centralization and unity, and oppose the phenomenon of decentralism. To this end, it is recommended that the administrative management, life management, public security and defense work, etc., of the units stationed in Guanzhuang under the Building Materials Industry Department system be unified and managed by the Design Administration Bureau, and a unified management system be established in a timely manner.

(6) In order to strengthen the education and upbringing of children, it is necessary to vigorously improve the management and education of the children's primary school and nursery, and resolutely implement the local government's teaching policy.

(7) Establish a staff amateur study committee to uniformly lead staff amateur study.

The meeting came to a temporary end on the afternoon of the 21st, and preparations are being made to continue the meeting when necessary in the future. Su Jiguang, on behalf of the presidium of the meeting, announced to the conference: (1) Request the worker representatives to return to their units, make good contact with the masses, supervise rectification, and promptly reflect the opinions and requirements of the masses to the presidium. (2) Require each unit to promptly raise major issues with commonality encountered in the continued rectification and future work, so as to resolve them by reconvening the Workers' Representative Conference. (3) Hope that the representatives will take the spirit of the conference back and implement it in the rectification and socialist education work, seek truth from facts to solve problems in work and ideology, strengthen unity among the organs, and improve the working relationship among the organs.

    管庄职工代表会议充满信心通过决议
    根除混乱现象  统一管理管庄
    新华社管庄21日电  驻在管庄的中央国家机关各单位，从19日到21日召开了职工代表会议。发动群众，继续集中整改，消灭管庄的混乱现象。会上，一致通过“加强管庄机关统一管理，彻底消灭管庄混乱现象”的决议。
    出席会议的职工代表和列席人员共八百多人。
    会上，建筑材料工业部设计管理局局长、管庄党委书记苏继光作了“我们要动员起来，为消灭‘自由王国’——管庄的混乱现象而斗争”的报告。他说，“自由王国”是无组织、无纪律、无政府状态的具体表现，是和社会主义不相容的。这种混乱现象主要表现在：各自为政，不顾整体，如对于公共事业都采取“能推就推”“能躲就躲”的不负责任的态度；各单位的工作人员之间也由于不同程度的本位主义思想作怪，互相看不起；社会秩序混乱，违法乱纪的行为不断发生。苏继光分析造成这种混乱现象的主要原因是各单位领导上的官僚主义以及长期存在着忽视政治的倾向和严重的本位主义思想。
    苏继光在报告中，强调继续深入鸣放，作好整改工作，向忽视政治倾向和本位主义思想开展斗争。
    国务院副秘书长、五人工作组组长曾一凡也在会上讲了话，他讲话的重点集中在加强统一领导，统一管理；加强政治思想工作等两个问题上。他说，为了更好地适应今后社会主义建设任务，驻在管庄的各个国家机关，除了继续大力进行整改，克服官僚主义外，首先把各单位应当和能够集中管理的问题，逐步的统一管理起来，消除各单位间互不协作，各自为政的无政府状态。其次要加强党、团、群众和家属的政治思想工作，向工作人员进行社会主义的法制教育、纪律教育和集体主义教育，彻底克服本位主义思想和忽视政治倾向。
    建筑材料工业部部长赖际发在会上讲话中，要求大家在统一认识的基础上，一齐行动起来，同坏人坏事和一切不良现象作斗争，坚决把管庄变成为一个有秩序、有领导的新管庄。
    会上，代表们一致认为以上的报告和讲话，帮助他们明确地认识了管庄混乱现象的严重性和危害性，从而增加了克服这些混乱现象的信心和决心。各单位的代表纷纷以严格检查自己和自我批评的精神，揭发了忽视政治倾向和本位主义思想的许多事实，并向会议提出了许多改进的意见和建议。代表们还愤怒地检举和控诉了一些违法乱纪、道德败坏的坏分子，并要求领导上严肃和认真地加以处理。
    会议代表、各设计院和研究院的院长和副院长，也都在会上批判了由于自己的忽视政治工作、右倾情绪和严重的本位主义思想，以致造成上行下效，使整个管庄充满着不关心政治的空气和宗派主义的情绪，并且还使得各种混乱现象和违法乱纪的行为，不能得到及时地解决和处理。
    到会代表们对于各院、处负责同志在会上所采取的自我批评精神，表示极大的欢迎，并表示将为消灭这些混乱现象而坚决行动起来。
    会上，一致通过了“彻底消灭管庄混乱现象”的决议。决议如下：
    （一）开展向忽视政治倾向和本位主义思想作斗争，通过整风运动彻底改变“自由王国”的混乱状况，提高国家机关工作人员社会主义思想，进一步改进国家机关工作。
    （二）成立爱国卫生运动委员会，开展“讲卫生、除四害”的群众性的运动，作好管庄的清洁卫生工作。

    （五）加强机关工作的领导，克服官僚主义，坚持集中统一，反对分散主义的现象。为此，建议凡是属于建筑材料工业部系统驻管庄单位的行政管理、生活管理、治安保卫工作等可以统一起来的，由设计管理局统一管理，并及时建立统一管理制度。
    （六）为了加强对少年儿童的教养，必须大力改进子弟小学和托儿所的管理教育工作，坚决贯彻地方政府的教学方针。
