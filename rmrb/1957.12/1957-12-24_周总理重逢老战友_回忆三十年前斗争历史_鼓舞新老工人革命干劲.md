Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 23rd: Premier Zhou Enlai held a discussion in Shanghai on the 22nd with over seventy veteran workers who participated in the "May Thirtieth" Movement and the three armed uprisings, over forty advanced producers, and senior officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai.

　　At the meeting, Premier Zhou recalled the history of the struggles of that time, encouraged everyone to inherit and carry forward the revolutionary traditions of the Shanghai working class, learn from the experiences and lessons of the struggles of that time, produce and work better, and build socialism well.

　　Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, Li Xuefeng, Minister of the Industrial Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, and Secretaries of the Secretariat Chen Pixian, Cao Diqiu, Wei Wenbo, Xu Jianguo, and Lieutenant General Wang Bicheng, Commander of the Shanghai Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Vice Admiral Tao Yong, Commander of the East China Sea Fleet, attended the symposium.

　　When the old comrades-in-arms of thirty years ago met Premier Zhou Enlai, many were too excited to speak. Premier Zhou shook hands with everyone and asked them how they were. Premier Zhou still recognized the faces of many people and said where they had worked together. Premier Zhou explained in detail the deeds, experiences, and lessons of the three armed uprisings of Shanghai workers and the struggles of Shanghai workers after the failure of the Great Revolution. He said: After thirty years, the situation in China has changed greatly, and the situation in the world has also changed greatly. Many of the people here today are comrades who have shared hardships in the past. We must tell the younger generation about the heroic sacrifices of the martyrs and the hard struggles of everyone, so that everyone can inherit the revolutionary traditions of Shanghai workers, not be afraid of difficulties, and build a socialist society well. Premier Zhou said: In the past few days, I have seen many young cadres from worker backgrounds in Shanghai. In them, I can still feel the kind of lively, hard-working, and fearless revolutionary spirit of the old generation of Shanghai workers, but they are more mature than we were in those days, because they grew up in the socialist era and have absorbed the experiences and lessons of long-term revolutionary struggles. Premier Zhou said to the young advanced producers: Today, I have invited you to listen to the memories of the past, and you will definitely become stronger. Now China has overthrown the rule of oppressors and exploiters, and you are living in a completely free world. As long as the old and new workers unite, the workers of the whole country unite, and the people of the whole of China unite, the Chinese working class, under the leadership of the Communist Party, will surely accomplish even more earth-shattering undertakings.

　　Shanghai veteran workers Qian Jianshi, Sun Changsheng, Di Fujin, Yang Fulin, Luo Jishou, Zhu Yingru, Qu Suzhen, Zhang Gencai, Gu Xishan, and others who participated in the "May Thirtieth" Movement and the three armed uprisings spoke at the meeting, telling many stories about working with Premier Zhou. Everyone excitedly expressed that they must carry forward the spirit of hard struggle in the past, better build a new socialist Shanghai, and use this to educate young people.

　　The symposium lasted for four hours.

　　Premier Zhou invited everyone to dinner. "Revolutionary Mother" Shi Xiaomei raised a toast to Premier Zhou on behalf of everyone. She also sang a revolutionary song popular among the workers.

　　In the evening, Premier Zhou watched a play with everyone. It was late at night when everyone reluctantly said goodbye to Premier Zhou.
