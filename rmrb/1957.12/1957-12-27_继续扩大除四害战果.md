Continuing to Expand the Achievements in the Eliminate the Four Pests Campaign

    Jishan County is a typical area in Shanxi Province for its patriotic health movement over the past few years. Over 50% of the villages in the county have maintained regular tidiness and cleanliness indoors, in courtyards, and on streets, ensuring that there have been no outbreaks of infectious diseases such as smallpox, typhoid fever, cholera, measles, and scarlet fever in the county for the past two years, and the incidence of other diseases has also decreased significantly. The people of the county have realized the benefits of eliminating the four pests and practicing hygiene, and are even more enthusiastic about carrying out the winter patriotic health movement. In the "Eliminate the Four Pests" campaign month that began at the end of November, they have achieved great results in the twenty-odd days up to early December. The county has eliminated more than 50,000 rats and 150,000 sparrows, and has blocked more than 30,000 rat holes. Fifty-nine villages have basically achieved the goal of being rat-free and sparrow-free. Now, the broad masses of the county are continuing to expand the achievements in eliminating the four pests and are striving to achieve their goal of eliminating all four pests in the county within five years.

    继续扩大除四害战果
    稷山县是山西省几年来爱国卫生运动的典型地区。该县已有50％以上的村庄做到室内、院内和街道上经常整齐清洁，保证了近两年来全县没有天花、伤寒、霍乱、麻疹、腥红热等传染病的发生，其他疾病的发病率也显著下降。全县人民体会到除四害、讲卫生的好处，对开展冬季爱国卫生运动更加起劲。他们从11月底开始的除四害突击月运动，到12月上旬的二十多天中，已获得了巨大的成绩。全县消灭老鼠五万多只，麻雀十五万多只，堵塞鼠洞三万多个，已有五十九个村基本上做到无鼠无雀。现在该县广大人民正在继续扩大除四害的成绩，为实现他们在五年内消灭全县四害的目标而努力。　　（黄德淑）
