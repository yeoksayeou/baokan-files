　　Fraternal Assistance
    By Our Correspondent Peng Fengye
    Recently, in the office of the Mongolian Government Building, the reporter interviewed Dulma, the First Vice Chairman of the Mongolian State Planning Commission, who recently returned from studying in the Soviet Union. She gave a general introduction to the strong assistance provided by the Soviet Union to Mongolia in terms of economy, technology, infrastructure construction, and cadre training.
    More than twenty years ago, the Soviet Union helped Mongolia establish a number of factories. These were the first new factories in Mongolian history, including the largest industrial combined factory currently. Since then, Mongolia has had a new industry, and a new working class has gradually grown up with it.
    In 1941, the meat processing complex was established in the capital with the help of the Soviet Union, and Mongolia began to have a food industry. Now, this factory is still gradually expanding. In various provinces, food factories for processing bread and butter have also been established one after another.
    The Mongolian grasslands are boundless. In the past, only the ancient post transportation was used to connect urban and rural people. Soviet experts and workers overcame all difficulties and helped Mongolia build more than a thousand kilometers of railways on the grasslands and deserts, connecting the herdsmen scattered on the grasslands with the cities, and promoting the development of economy, culture, and transportation. In particular, the opening of the railway connecting the capitals of Mongolia, China, and the Soviet Union, known as the "Road of Friendship," has brought extremely convenient conditions for further strengthening the close ties between the people of the three countries and the socialist countries.
    In the last two years, the Soviet Union has been helping the Mongolian people build eighteen industrial, agricultural, animal husbandry, and municipal construction projects. Among these construction projects, a factory with an annual output of 5,000 tons of refreshments and sweets has been built on the open space in Ulaanbaatar. A processing plant that can process 40 tons of fresh milk per day, using Mongolia's large amount of milk, is under construction. Four flour mills of varying sizes are being built in Ulaanbaatar, Choibalsan and other provinces and cities. After these flour mills are completed, coupled with the continuous increase in Mongolia's agricultural production, the current situation of grain imports will be gradually changed. The Nalaikh Coal Mine, currently the largest coal mine in Mongolia, which the Soviet Union is helping to build with manpower and machinery, can be put into production this winter or next spring. Now, more than 200 Soviet experts and technicians are working intensively inside and outside the mine with Mongolian and Chinese workers. This coal mine, with an annual output of 600,000 tons, will supply the production of factories and enterprises in the capital and the people's needs for the winter.
    According to the long-term plan for the construction of Ulaanbaatar, starting this year, the Soviet Union is helping to carry out several municipal construction projects. The residential area, expected to be completed by 1960, will reach 40,000 square meters, including 24 three-story buildings and 16 four-story buildings, which will accommodate 1,100 households. Construction has also begun this year on more than 60 kilometers of tap water pipelines, more than 70 kilometers of urban sewage pipelines, and more than 60 kilometers of heating supply equipment. These massive projects will be completed before 1972.
    In May of this year, after talks between the government delegations of Mongolia and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union again provided a loan of 200 million rubles on preferential terms to help Mongolia develop agriculture and animal husbandry well in the future three-year plan (1958-1960). Mongolia will use the loan to purchase thousands of tractors, harvesters, and trucks from the Soviet Union, import 10,000 purebred cattle and sheep from the Soviet Union, build six large-scale animal husbandry machinery stations, and set up 600 sets of wooden houses to settle 1,200 herding families on the grasslands. These aids provide a reliable material guarantee for Mongolia to increase livestock by 5.6% in the three-year plan, increase arable land by one and a half times, expand the feed base, develop pastoral production cooperatives, and gradually settle herdsmen.
    During the talks, the Soviet Union also decided to transfer the Petroleum Trust, the airport buildings and equipment in Ulaanbaatar and Sainshand, as well as several aircraft to Mongolia free of charge. The value of the petroleum enterprise alone reaches 300 million rubles. In addition, the Soviet Union also transferred the Soviet shares of the "Mongol-Soviet Joint Metal Stock Company" to Mongolia on preferential terms.
    Mongolia's factories and enterprises have thus developed from scratch with the help of the Soviet Union. Dulma said that when each factory and enterprise was built, almost all of the construction, from surveying and design to construction and installation, was assisted by Soviet experts and technicians, and almost all of the machines were supplied by the Soviet Union. Therefore, the technology is also the latest and most advanced. The Nalaikh Coal Mine under construction is fully automated from drilling, coal mining, coal loading, transportation, and unloading. In the past and present, the Soviet Union has sent many experts to help explore and investigate Mongolia's mining, agriculture, animal husbandry, and water conservancy. From next year, it will continue to send experts in industry, mining, agriculture, and animal husbandry to various parts of Mongolia to help with inspections.
    While helping with construction, Soviet experts also trained a large number of Mongolian technical staff. Dulma introduced that there are two ways to train Mongolian cadres. One is that Soviet experts use the method of apprenticeship, teaching while doing, so that they can master the technology. At the same time, training courses are held in relevant business departments, and experts teach courses to train them. The other method is to send high- and middle-level Mongolian technicians to study in Soviet factories and schools, sending as many as needed. The Vice Chairman said that there are now more than 1,000 people studying in Soviet higher and secondary specialized schools alone. The number of other engineers and interns who go to the Soviet Union to study has also increased compared to the past. Domestically, there are many examples of Mongolian workers learning from Soviet advanced experience to improve their technical level.
    Before the revolution, Mongolia, which was dominated by nomadic animal husbandry, had no working class. Now, the new working class accounts for about 27% of the country's population. Dulma vividly introduced the growth of Mongolian technical experts and workers, saying that in the past, Mongolia did not even have an accountant, but now it has its own economic experts; the only lama doctors in the past could not guarantee the health of the people, but after the revolution, more than 1,000 doctors who have mastered modern medical technology have been trained. When the industrial combined factory was built more than 20 years ago, Soviet experts helped with production there. Now, this largest combined factory that processes leather and fur, with an annual output of more than 150 kinds of products worth more than 46 million Tugriks, is entirely run by its own experts and domestic employees. In the early days of the construction of the young Mongolian railway transportation, almost all the technicians along the line were hired from the Soviet Union. Now, with the help of Soviet comrades, the vast majority of Mongolian railway workers have grown up. (Attached picture)

　　兄弟般的帮助
    本报记者　彭逢烨
    最近，在蒙古政府大厦的办公室里，记者访问了不久前从苏联学习回来的蒙古国家计划委员会第一副主席杜尔玛，她就苏联在经济、技术、基本建设和培养干部方面对蒙古的大力帮助，作了概括的介绍。
    二十多年以前，苏联帮助蒙古建立了一批工厂，这是蒙古历史上的第一批新工厂，包括目前规模最大的工业联合工厂。从此，蒙古有了新的工业，新的工人阶级也随着逐渐成长起来。
    1941年，肉类联合加工厂在苏联帮助下在首都建立，蒙古开始有了食品工业。现在，这个厂还在逐步扩大。在各个省，也相继建立了加工面包、奶油的食品工厂。
    蒙古草原无垠，过去，仅凭古老的驿运来联系城乡人民。苏联专家和工人们克服一切困难，帮助蒙古在大草原和沙漠上修建了一千几百多公里铁路，使分散在草原上的牧民和城市联结起来，促进了经济文化和交通运输的发展。特别是被称作“友谊之路”的连接着蒙、中、苏三国首都铁路的通车，对进一步加强三国人民和社会主义各国间的紧密联系，带来了极为方便的条件。
    在最近两年间，苏联帮助蒙古人民建设着十八个工业、农牧业和市政建设项目。在这些建设工程中，一个年产五千吨点心和糖果的工厂，已经在乌兰巴托市的空地上建立起来了。利用蒙古的大量的牛奶、每天能够加工四十吨鲜奶的加工厂正在兴建。在乌兰巴托、乔巴山等省市，开始兴建四个大小不等的面粉厂，这几个面粉厂建成后，配合蒙古农业生产的不断增涨，将逐步改变粮食进口的现状。苏联以人力和机器帮助兴修的蒙古目前最大的一个煤矿——那来河煤矿，今冬或明春就可以投入生产。现在，两百多名苏联专家、技术员，正和蒙古、中国工人紧张地在矿井内外工作。这个年产达六十万吨的煤矿，将供应首都工厂企业的生产和人民过冬的需要。
    根据乌兰巴托建设的远景规划，从今年开始，苏联帮助进行几项市政建设。预计到1960年竣工的住宅面积达四万平方公尺，其中包括二十四座三层楼房和十六座四层楼房，将容一千一百户居民。今年已经动工的还有长六十多公里的自来水管道、长七十多公里的市内下水道和六十多公里长的暖气供应设备，这几项工程浩繁，将要在1972年以前完成。
    今年5月，蒙苏两国政府代表团经过会谈，苏联又以优惠条件贷款两亿卢布，帮助蒙古在未来的三年计划（1958—1960年）中，很好地发展农牧业。蒙古将利用贷款，从苏联购买几千台拖拉机、收割机和载重卡车，从苏联进口一万头纯种牛、羊，兴建六个大型畜牧业机器站，并且设置六百套木结构房屋，使一千二百户牧民在草原上定居下来。这些援助，对蒙古在三年计划中增殖牲畜5.6％，增加耕地面积一倍半，扩大饲料基地，发展牧业生产合作社和使牧民逐步定居，提供了可靠的物质保证。
    会谈中，苏联还决定将石油托辣斯、乌兰巴托和赛音山达的飞机场建筑物、设备以及若干架飞机，无偿地移交给蒙古，仅石油企业的价值就达三亿卢布。此外，苏联还将“蒙苏合营金属股份公司”的苏联股份以优惠条件让给蒙古。
    蒙古的工厂企业就是这样在苏联的帮助下从无到有发展起来的。杜尔玛说，每一个工厂企业在兴建时，从勘测设计、施工到安装，几乎全部由苏联专家和技术人员来帮助建设，所有的机器，也几乎全由苏联供应的。因此，技术上也是最新的和先进的。兴建中的那来河煤矿，从打井、挖煤、装煤、运送、卸煤全都是自动化。过去和现在，苏联曾经派过很多专家来帮助勘探、考察蒙古的矿业和农牧、水利事业。从明年起，还要继续派遣工矿、农牧专家分赴蒙古各地帮助考察。
    苏联专家们在帮助建设的同时，还培养了大量的蒙古技术员工。杜尔玛介绍培养蒙古干部的方式有两种，一种是，苏联专家用带徒弟的办法，边作边教，使他们掌握技术。同时，在有关的企业部门开办训练班，由专家教课培养。另一种方式是派遣高中级的蒙古技术人员到苏联的工厂、学校学习，需要多少就派多少。这位副主席说，现在，仅在苏联高等和中等专科学校学习的就有一千多人。其他工程师、实习生前往苏联学习的也比过去增多了。在国内，蒙古工人们学习苏联先进经验，提高技术水平的事例是很多的。
    革命前，以游牧为主的蒙古是没有工人阶级的，现在，新的工人阶级已经占全国人口27％左右了。杜尔玛向我们生动地介绍蒙古技术专家和工人成长的经过说，过去的蒙古，连一个会计人员也没有，现在已经有了自己的经济专家；过去仅有的喇嘛医生，对人民的健康是不能保障的，革命以后，已经培养了一千多名掌握现代医学技术的医生了。二十多年前兴建工业联合工厂时，是由苏联专家在那里帮助进行生产，现在，这个年产一百五十多种产品、价值四千六百多万图格里克加工皮、毛的最大的联合工厂，完全是自己的专家和本国的职工在进行生产。年青的蒙古铁路运输，在建设初期，沿线技工几乎都是从苏联聘请来的。现在，在苏联同志的帮助下，绝大部分蒙古铁路工人已经成长起来了。（附图片）
