Xinhua News Agency, December 14th: People from all walks of life in the capital held a grand meeting at the CPPCC Auditorium this evening to enthusiastically support the Asian-African Solidarity Conference to be held in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, on December 26.

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese Asian Solidarity Committee and head of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, delivered a long speech at the meeting. His speech repeatedly aroused stormy and enthusiastic applause throughout the venue. In his speech, Guo Moruo elaborated on the significance of holding this Asian-African Solidarity Conference and especially expressed support for the peace proposals recently put forward by the Soviet government.

Guo Moruo affirmed that the Asian and African people's struggle for national independence and the defense of peace would be invincible. The dominant force is no longer the imperialist forces, but the united strength of socialist countries, nationally independent countries, and peace-loving people all over the world. If the imperialists dare to play with fire in any corner of Asia and Africa, dare to play with fire on the Syrian border, their fate will be the same as the invaders in Egypt and will suffer a shameful and miserable defeat, and even more miserably. If they dare to launch a third world war, it will be the demise of the entire capitalist system. (For the full text of the speech, see page 4)

The meeting was presided over by Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Asian Solidarity Committee. In his opening remarks, he said that the Asian-African Solidarity Conference is being held at a time when the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly united, the world's peace forces are extremely strong, and colonialism and imperialism are increasingly heading towards collapse. He believes that the convening of this conference will make new and significant contributions to promoting the friendly unity of the Asian and African peoples, opposing colonialism, striving for national independence, and safeguarding the just struggle for world peace.

Liu Ningyi said that the Chinese people have always been loyal to the cause of peace and friendship and resolutely opposed colonialism and imperialist aggression policies. Therefore, we warmly welcome and fully support the convening of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference.

Liu Ningyi said that the Chinese people are willing to stand together with the people of Asian and African countries forever, and are willing to stand together with all peace-loving and justice-upholding people in the world forever to strengthen unity and cooperation. We firmly support the peace proposals recently put forward by the Soviet government, and we will jointly strive for disarmament, for the prohibition of nuclear weapons, for further easing international tensions, for opposing imperialist aggression, and for world peace.

Bao Erhan, Director of the China Islamic Association and Deputy Head of the Chinese Delegation to the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, and Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, also spoke at the meeting.

In his speech, Bao Erhan said that opposing colonialism, opposing imperialism, striving for national independence and liberation, and defending world peace have become the common calls of all awakened nations in Asia and Africa. He pointed out that in the two years since the Bandung Conference, countries such as Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, and Ghana in the Near East and Africa have successively gained independence. The struggle against colonial oppression and for national independence is surging everywhere.

Bao Erhan said that the imperialists will not be reconciled to their failure, and they will not automatically withdraw from the throne of rule and give up their acquired interests. In particular, the American war bloc is pursuing its aggressive policies all over the world and is deliberately trying to sow discord in the unity of Asian and African countries, creating division and confrontation among Asian and African countries in order to achieve the goal of defeating them one by one. However, as long as we strengthen the unity between Asian and African countries, strengthen the unity of all peace-loving forces in the world, raise vigilance, and persist in resisting aggression, all the conspiracies of imperialism can be smashed.

Bao Erhan also specifically mentioned the Indonesian people's struggle to recover West Irian. He said that in this just struggle, the Chinese people will always be the loyal friends of the Indonesian people. He believes that no matter how many difficulties are experienced, this just struggle is bound to be victorious. Bao Erhan also expressed his firm support for the heroic struggle of the Algerian people and wished the Algerian people new victories in their future struggles.

In his speech, Chen Shutong, on behalf of the people of the capital, warmly bid farewell to the Chinese delegation that is about to go to Cairo to attend the Asian-African Solidarity Conference. He said that the Chinese delegation represents the Chinese people's desire for peaceful coexistence, unity, and friendship, and represents the strong will of the people of the whole country to oppose wars of aggression and their active support for the struggle of all oppressed nations against colonialism. We hope and firmly believe that our delegation will fully bring these wishes of our people to the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, and will bring back to us the fruits of the greater unity and friendship of the Asian and African peoples upon their return.

The meeting unanimously adopted the telegram from the conference to the Preparatory Committee of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference. (See page 4)

After the meeting, the Egyptian film "Port Said" and the color documentary "Ode to the Nile" filmed by Chinese filmmakers in Egypt were shown.

More than a thousand people from all walks of life in the capital attended tonight's meeting. Some foreign guests visiting Beijing were also invited to attend the meeting. (Attached picture)

　　中国人民同亚非人民永远在一起
    首都各界集会热烈支持亚非团结大会
    并完全赞同苏联政府提出的和平创议
    据新华社14日讯　首都各界人民今天晚间在政协礼堂举行盛大集会，热烈支持将于12月26日在埃及首都开罗召开的亚非团结大会。
    中国亚洲团结委员会主席、出席亚非团结大会中国代表团团长郭沫若在会上作了长篇讲话。他的讲话不断地引起整个会场上发出暴风雨般的热烈掌声。郭沫若在讲话中阐述了召开这次亚非团结大会的意义，并且特别表示支持苏联政府最近提出的和平建议。
    郭沫若肯定地指出，亚非人民争取民族独立和保卫和平的斗争将无往而不胜。现在占着绝对优势的已不再是帝国主义力量，而是社会主义国家和民族独立国家的人民和全世界爱好和平人民的团结力量了。帝国主义者如果敢于在亚非地区的任何一个角落玩火，敢于在叙利亚边境玩火，他们的命运必将同在埃及的侵略者一样遭到可耻的惨败，而且还要失败得更惨。如果他们敢于发动第三次世界大战，那就是整个资本主义体系的灭亡。（讲话全文见第四版）
    大会由中国亚洲团结委员会副主席刘宁一主持。他在致开会词中说，亚非团结大会是正当以苏联为首的社会主义阵营空前团结、世界和平力量无比强大、殖民主义和帝国主义日益走向崩溃的时候召开的，他相信这次会议的召开，将对促进亚非人民的友好团结、反对殖民主义和争取民族独立以及维护世界和平的正义斗争，作出新的巨大贡献。
    刘宁一说，中国人民一向忠于和平友好事业，坚决反对殖民主义和帝国主义侵略政策，因此，我们热烈欢迎和完全支持亚非团结大会的召开。
    刘宁一说，中国人民愿意和亚非各国人民永远站在一起，愿意和世界上一切爱好和平和主张正义的人们永远站在一起，加强团结合作。我们坚决支持苏联政府最近提出的和平建议，为裁减军备，为禁止核武器，为进一步和缓国际紧张局势，为反对帝国主义侵略和争取世界和平而共同奋斗。
    中国伊斯兰教协会主任、出席亚非团结大会中国代表团副团长包尔汉和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席陈叔通先后在大会上讲了话。
    包尔汉在讲话中说，反对殖民主义，反对帝国主义，争取民族独立解放和保卫世界和平，已经是亚非各个觉醒了的民族的共同呼声。他指出，在万隆会议召开后的两年多来，在中近东和非洲地区，如突尼斯、摩洛哥、苏丹、加纳等国家又先后获得了独立。反对殖民主义压迫、争取民族独立的解放斗争，到处风起云涌。
    包尔汉说，帝国主义者是不会甘心于他们的失败的，他们不会自动地退出统治宝座和放弃已得的利益。特别是美国战争集团，正在世界各地推行它们的侵略政策，并处心积虑地挑拨离间亚非各国的团结，制造亚非国家间的分裂对立，以达到各个击破的目的。但是，只要我们加强亚非国家间的团结，加强世界上一切爱好和平力量的团结，提高警惕，坚持反抗侵略，帝国主义的一切阴谋都是可以击破的。
    包尔汉还特别谈到印度尼西亚人民收复西伊里安的斗争。他说，在这一正义的斗争中，中国人民永远是印度尼西亚人民的忠实朋友。他相信，不管要经历多少困难，这一正义的斗争，是一定要胜利的。包尔汉还表示坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争，并且祝阿尔及利亚人民在今后的斗争中取得新的胜利。
    陈叔通在讲话中，代表首都人民热烈欢送即将前往开罗出席亚非团结大会的中国代表团。他说，中国代表团代表着六亿中国人民主张和平共处、团结友好的愿望，代表着全国人民反对侵略战争的坚强意志和对一切被压迫民族反对殖民主义斗争的积极支持。我们希望而且也坚信，我们的代表团一定会把我国人民这些愿望充分带到亚非团结大会上去，并且在回来时，把亚非各国人民更加团结友好的果实带给我们。
    大会最后一致通过了大会给亚非团结大会筹备委员会的电文。（见第四版）
    大会结束以后，放映了埃及影片“塞得港”和中国电影工作者在埃及拍摄的五彩纪录片“尼罗河颂”。
    出席今晚大会的，有首都各界人民一千多人。在北京访问的一些外国来宾也应邀出席了大会。（附图片）
