Newspaper Article Summary

    The process of young intellectuals accepting socialist transformation is a long-term and arduous struggle. Whether a person transforms well or not mainly depends on the level of consciousness and one's own efforts. Since ideological remolding is a fierce ideological struggle, it is not without pain. The extent of the pain also mainly depends on one's own level of awareness and the degree of effort. What should young intellectuals transform, and what should they establish? Generally speaking, it is to eliminate capitalism and promote proletarianism, that is, to eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology; to break with the capitalist stance and establish a socialist stance; to oppose taking the capitalist road and resolutely take the socialist road. This is the general trend and cannot be resisted by anyone. Socialist revolution and democratic revolution have fundamental differences. In the past, many people joined the Party and the League and participated in revolutionary work with the demands of the democratic revolution, which was progressive at the time. Now the situation has changed, it is the socialist revolution, so the ideology should also change accordingly. In the past, as long as there was the demand for democratic revolution, the war hurdle and the land reform hurdle were relatively easy to pass; now, it is necessary to have the demands of the socialist revolution and socialist consciousness to pass the socialist hurdle relatively smoothly. This is a major change in ideology. The socialist hurdle is hard to pass, but it must be passed, which requires us to be determined to transform ourselves.

### 社会主义关不好过，但必须过

    社会主义关不好过，但必须过
    青年知识分子接受社会主义改造的过程，是一个长期的、艰巨的斗争过程。一个人改造得好或不好，主要决定于自觉性的高低，决定于自己的努力。思想改造既是一场激烈的思想斗争，就不是没有痛苦的，痛苦的大小，也主要决定于自己觉悟的高低和努力的程度。青年知识分子应当改造什么，树立什么呢？总的说来，是灭资兴无，也就是说灭资产阶级思想，兴无产阶级思想；破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场；反对走资本主义道路，坚决走社会主义道路，这是大势所趋，是任何人也抗拒不了的。社会主义革命和民主主义革命有原则区别。过去有许多人抱着民主主义革命的要求入党入团，参加革命工作，这在当时是进步的。现在形势变了，是社会主义革命了，所以思想也应该跟着变。过去只要有民主主义革命的要求，战争关，土改关都比较好过；现在则必须有社会主义革命的要求，有社会主义的觉悟，才能比较顺利地通过社会主义这一关。这是一个思想上的大变化。社会主义关不好过，但又必须过，这就要求我们下定决心改造自己。（摘自1957年中国青年半月刊第二十三期安子文：“千锤百炼，改造自己”）
