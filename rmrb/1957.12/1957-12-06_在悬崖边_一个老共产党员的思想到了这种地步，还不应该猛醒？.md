　　At the Edge of the Cliff
　　Shouldn't an Old Communist Party Member Wake Up When His Thinking Reaches This Point?
　　By Our Correspondent Wang Qing
    In the Coal Industry Ministry building, among the countless dazibao (big-character posters) plastered all over the corridors, about a hundred mentioned one name: Zhang Wen.
    Who is Zhang Wen? What caused him to attract so much attention? What are the masses' opinions of him? What obvious weaknesses does Zhang Wen have in his thinking and work style? These are all questions.
    Better to Do One Less Thing Than One More
    Zhang Wen is currently the Deputy Director of the Coal Industry Ministry's Safety Supervision Bureau. The task of the Safety Supervision Bureau is to supervise and ensure the production safety of coal miners nationwide. As the person in charge of this bureau (there was no director before 1957), it cannot be said that Zhang Wen's responsibilities are not important. However, over the years, Zhang Wen has proven through his actions that he has failed the trust of the Party and the state.
    In his work, Zhang Wen is not conscientiously responsible for the revolutionary cause, but rather idles away his time, with no intention of doing anything. For example, when the bureau sometimes holds meetings, he sits alone reading the newspaper, neither analyzing the situation nor listening to the opinions of the masses. Before the meeting ends, he gets up to speak, and as a result, what he says is completely different from what everyone has been discussing, leaving everyone confused. He is unwilling to attend ministerial meetings, and when he sends someone to attend on his behalf, he refuses to implement the ministry's decisions upon their return. Once, the ministerial meeting decided that the Safety Supervision Bureau would be responsible for drafting instructions and regulations on safety procedures. Zhang Wen found it troublesome and disagreed, even losing his temper and saying, "Whoever wants to do it can do it, we're not doing it!" On another occasion, the ministry decided that the Safety Supervision Bureau should draft the "Coal Mine Accident Reporting Regulations," and Zhang Wen again disagreed. Because coal mines in various places urgently needed these regulations, many staff members in the bureau, out of a sense of responsibility for their work, had to avoid Zhang Wen and secretly work on them. Sometimes, when comrades held meetings to discuss work, if he discovered it, he would even break up the meeting. After the comrades drafted the regulations, Zhang Wen would keep them shelved for a long time, refusing to sign and issue them.
    The philosophy of life that it is better to do one less thing than one more has led Zhang Wen to adopt an extremely indifferent attitude towards his work. He has never seriously studied his work, nor has he proactively asked for instructions or reported to his superiors. Every day, he is carefree, smoking and reading newspapers in his office, and even chatting with people in various offices and departments during work hours, affecting the work. Over the years, under Zhang Wen's leadership, the Safety Supervision Bureau, from the bureau to the departments, has had no systematic plan, and its work has been in a state of drift and chaos for a long time.
      Who is "Too Naive"?
    Zhang Wen often liked to warn his subordinates in a lecturing tone: "Too naive!" What does this "too naive" refer to?
    There was a period of time when the Safety Supervision Bureau's work was not progressing, and many cadres were idle and bored. So, some people went to Zhang Wen to ask for work. Zhang Wen's response to the masses' enthusiasm for work was: "You are too naive!"
    Once, several cadres went down to the mines to investigate the causes of accidents. After returning, they reported to Zhang Wen, hoping to get his instructions to help solve the problems in their work; or to have Zhang Wen report to higher authorities and ask the ministry leaders to resolve them. This normal and legitimate request was also criticized. Zhang Wen lost his temper and said, "Doesn't the minister know about such accidents? Doesn't the Production Department know? You are really capable, too naive!" Again, "too naive."
    Last year, accidents occurred continuously at the Hegang Coal Mine, and several cadres in the bureau requested to go down for inspection. After obtaining the consent of Director Ma, they went to prepare for their trip. When they were at the Finance Department to collect money to buy train tickets, they encountered Zhang Wen; after Zhang Wen learned about this, it was the same old saying: too naive!
    The phrase "too naive," in Zhang Wen's mouth, is actually a synonym for shirking responsibility and venting dissatisfaction.
    Unusual "Business Trips"
    Zhang Wen sometimes goes down to inspect the work. However, in his own words, it is "taking a fleeting glance." In fact, he often does not even look at the "flowers."
    Not long ago, Zhang Wen took people to the Fengfeng Coal Mine to help establish a safety supervision bureau. He stayed in Fengfeng for more than ten days. The person in charge of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau had high hopes for the people from the ministry and requested to inspect the safety situation in the mines. However, Zhang Wen did not go; he stayed at the guesthouse sleeping and playing poker. The secretary of the Mining Bureau's Party Committee came to Zhang Wen to discuss the establishment of the bureau. Zhang Wen was engrossed in playing poker and had no interest in talking about work. The Party Committee secretary waited helplessly and left.
    From Fengfeng, Zhang Wen went to Jingxing Coal Mine. Here, he spent most of his time resting at the guesthouse. Of course, he also went to the mine, but in a hurried manner. After coming up from one mine, the mine director hoped to hear Zhang Wen's instructions on the work, but Zhang Wen asked the accompanying cadres to talk, while he leaned back on the sofa, closed his eyes, and rested. After getting up from the sofa, Zhang Wen proposed to see the newly installed fan. The mine immediately sent a car for transportation. However, he did not go to see the fan. Jingxing is Zhang Wen's hometown; near the fan, he got out of the car and went to a village to see old friends.
    In Jingxing, Zhang Wen also did another thing: he found many friends, spent a lot of money, and took time to erect stone tablets for his deceased father and younger brother.
    Returning to Beijing from Jingxing, Zhang Wen could neither report to his superiors nor give instructions to his subordinates. Idling, chatting, seeing friends, repairing graves..., what could he come up with?
    Zhang Wen's business trips did not help the work, nor did they help anyone. Because of this, the young people of the Safety Supervision Bureau, none of them wanted to go out with their Deputy Director Zhang.
    Tired of Party Life
    Zhang Wen is a Communist Party member with thirty years of Party membership. Under normal circumstances, he should be a strong revolutionary fighter, should actively participate in the activities of the Party organization, and should strictly and fully consciously fulfill the obligations of a Party member. But it is not so. He has no interest in political study, and rarely reads study documents, even during the prescribed study time. He is unwilling to attend Party meetings; he is tired of Party organizational life. Over the years, due to his insistence, the Party group meetings of the Safety Supervision Bureau mostly take up working hours – he is unwilling to "sacrifice" his spare time. He attends Party meetings often with a vexed mood, asking before the meeting: "What meeting is this again?" Saying in the middle of the meeting: "There is nothing great! It's still the same old thing!" "Who doesn't know who? There aren't that many opinions!" He sees serious meetings as the greatest burden.
    What best expresses his relationship with the Party is the issue of paying Party dues.
    For a long time, whenever Zhang Wen received his salary, he would take out a five-yuan bill from his salary bag and let the Party group leader and the trade union group leader "distribute" it: three yuan and five jiao for Party dues, and one yuan and five jiao for trade union dues. However, according to his income, according to regulations, five yuan is not enough: the Party dues are insufficient, and the trade union dues are also less. The Party group leader, of course, could not agree and went to him to ask him to pay the full amount. However, Zhang Wen was very unreasonable, and arguments occurred every time. For this matter, he even lost his temper with the Party group leader five times, he even said: "Paying Party dues is voluntary (?!)" "You are like capitalists collecting debts!"
  "In the past, we were oppressed by capitalists, now we are oppressed by the Communist Party!" ... Once, the argument became too excessive, and an ordinary staff member even wanted to take out money to pay Zhang Wen's Party dues in full!
    Zhang Wen! Are you still a Party member? What have you turned the Party into! A thirty-year-old Party member, with such terrible thinking, how do you understand the provisions of the Party Constitution, and how do you understand the obligations of a Party member?
      A Glimpse of Interests
    Since he is indifferent and bored with everything, what interests does Zhang Wen have? It may be hard to believe, but many people cannot answer. However, some people have uncovered some of his secrets.
    Turning to the "Coal Industry" monthly magazine, several consecutive issues have articles signed by Zhang Wen. However, people who know the inside story know that this is not from Zhang Wen's hand, but the result of the labor of other comrades in the Supervision Bureau. These comrades wrote articles and asked Zhang Wen to review them; Zhang Wen made very few revisions (one article only added four words, which were eventually deleted by the magazine editor), but added his name and forcibly divided the royalties. It was not until the third stage of the rectification movement began and the Coal Industry Ministry's Rectification Leading Group issued a notice that he returned the royalties.
    Signing his name on other people's articles, Zhang Wen is not just for dividing the royalties. When he went to Datong on a business trip, he even asked the local supervision bureau staff: "Have you seen my article?" Boasting triumphantly.
    Using the labor of others to exchange for enjoyment and reputation is not honorable, and this kind of interest is actually an extremely bad exploitative class ideology.
    One Foot Stepped Out of the Party's Door
    Zhang Wen came from a coal mining worker's background, and his father was also a coal mining worker. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1927, and once served as a Party underground liaison, county Party committee organization minister, director of the production section of the North China Coal Mining Administration, and deputy director of the Administration. In those tense and arduous days of struggle, he risked his life, working for the Party day and night; at the Coal Mining Administration, he also went deep into the front lines, studied production, and made achievements in his work. However, today, all this has not become a force to urge him to continue to move forward, he indulges in his seniority, good background, and having done some work for the Party, and relies on this to be complacent, to stagnate, and to be self-satisfied. Many comrades who once worked with him have made great strides forward with the development of the revolutionary cause. Instead of using this to motivate himself, he is full of complaints and complains about the organization. He has adopted an attitude of confrontation and contempt towards those leading comrades who have shorter Party membership than him. The Party discovered his series of mistakes, and in order to save him, had talked to him. The Party branch and the Party group had also held meetings for him, giving him criticism and education. However, all this did not make him wake up and repent; he refused help, resented the comrades who exposed his mistakes, and even lost his temper with the comrades, saying things like "You might as well say I am a counter-revolutionary, sent by Taiwan..."
    At this point, one of Zhang Wen's feet has already stepped out of the Party's door. What is the cause of the Party, where is the direction of advancement, how should one's life be used to be valuable, all this, Zhang Wen has lost the ability to distinguish? He has no ideals, and the lines between love and hate have also lost their clear boundaries in him. In this way, unwarranted conceit, endless complaints, coupled with the spread of the selfish and self-interested mold he has cast on himself, has completely made this man, who once came from the battle and has thirty years of Party membership, lose his vigor, and his political life has slowly withered.
    Zhang Wen's actions show that he is taking the final step towards the edge of the cliff. Who can save him, besides the Party, it is himself.

### 在悬崖边　一个老共产党员的思想到了这种地步，还不应该猛醒？

　　在悬崖边
　　一个老共产党员的思想到了这种地步，还不应该猛醒？
　　本报记者　王青
    煤炭工业部的大楼里，在贴满走廊的无数大字报中间，有百来张大字报都提到了一个人的名字：张文。
    张文是谁？是什么原因使他引起了这样多人的注意？群众对他有些什么样的看法？张文在思想上、作风上又有哪些明显的弱点？这些都是问题。
    多一事不如少一事
    张文现在是煤炭工业部安全监察局的副局长。安全监察局的任务是监督和保证全国煤矿工人的生产安全，作为这个局的负责人（1957年以前没有正局长），张文所担负的责任不能说不重要。可是，几年来张文用自己的行动证明，他辜负了党和国家的委托。
    在工作中，张文不是兢兢业业地对革命事业负责，而是饱食终日，无所用心。譬如，局里有时开会，他独自在一旁看报，既不分析情况，又不听取群众意见，会议结束前，他起立发言，结果他说的和大家谈的完全两回事，使大家莫名其妙。部务会议，他不愿意参加，派人去参加回来，对部的决定他又拒绝执行。有一次，部务会议决定关于保安规程的指示规程的编制问题，由安全监察局负责。张文嫌麻烦，不同意，并且大发脾气说：“谁愿干谁干，反正我们不干！”另一次，部决定安全监察局起草“煤矿事故报告规程”的工作，张文又不同意。由于各地煤矿急需这项规程，因此，局里的许多工作人员出于对工作的责任心，不得不避开张文而偷着干。有时同志们开会研究工作，被他发现了，他竟把会议驱散。等到同志们把这项规程草案拟出来以后，张文又长期积压，拒不签发。
    多一事不如少一事的人生哲学，使得张文对工作抱了极端的冷漠态度。他从来没有认真研究过工作，也没有主动地向领导请示和汇报过。每天，他逍遥自在，在自己的办公室吸吸烟，看看报，甚至工作时间内到处、科找人闲聊，影响工作。这些年来，安全监察局在张文的领导下，从局到处，没有系统的计划，工作长时期陷于自流而忙乱的状态。
      谁“太天真”
    张文常常爱用教训的口吻警告他的下属：“太天真！”这“太天真”指的是什么呢？
    安全监察局曾经有一段时间，由于工作没有开展，许多干部闲得发慌。于是有些人便去找张文要工作。对群众的这种工作热情，张文的答复却是：“你们太天真了！”
    一次，有几名干部下矿检查事故发生的原因，回来以后向张文汇报，希望能得到他的指示，帮助解决工作中的问题；或是由张文向上级汇报，转请部领导解决。这种正常而又正当的要求，同样遭到指责。张文大发脾气说：“发生这样的事故，部长不知道吗？生产司不知道吗？你们本事真大，太天真了！”又是“太天真”。
    去年，鹤岗煤矿连续发生事故，局里的几个干部要求下去进行检查。他们向马局长请示得到同意以后，便去准备行装。他们正在向财务司领钱要去买车票的时候，遇上了张文；张文知道这件事情以后，又是那句老话：太天真！
    “太天真”这句话，在张文口里，实际上是他推卸责任、发泄不满的代名词。
    不寻常的“出差”
    张文有时也下去检查工作。不过，用他自己的话说：那是“走马看花”。其实，他是连“花”也常常不看的。
    不久以前，张文带着人去峰峰煤矿帮助成立安全监察局。在峰峰，他共停留了十多天。峰峰矿务局的负责人对部里来人抱着很大的希望，提出了去矿井检查安全情况的要求。可是，张文并没有去，他住在招待所睡觉、打扑克。矿务局党委书记来找张文研究建局的问题，张文打扑克的兴趣正浓，那有心思谈工作，党委书记等得无可奈何地走了。
    从峰峰，张文又到了井陉煤矿。在这里，他的绝大部分时间也是在招待所休息。当然，他也去了矿井，但是行色匆匆。从一矿井上来，矿长希望听到张文对工作的指示，张文却让随从干部去谈，自己倒在沙发上，闭起双眼，休息起来。从沙发上起来，张文提出要去看新安装的风机。矿上立即派来了汽车代步。可是，他并没有去看风机。井陉是张文的故乡；在风机的附近他下了车，转到一个村庄去看老朋友去了。
    在井陉，张文还做了另一件事：找了很多朋友，花了不少钱，费了时间，为死去的父亲和弟弟立起了石碑。
    从井陉回到北京，张文既不能向领导汇报，也不能向下级作指示。闲住，聊天，看朋友，修坟墓……，他能够拿出些什么来呢？
    张文的出差对工作没有帮助，对任何人也没有帮助。就因为这个，安全监察局的青年们，谁也不愿意跟着自己的张副局长外出了。
    厌倦了党的生活
    张文是共产党员，有着三十年的党龄。按照一般的情况，他应当是一个坚强的革命战士，应当积极参加党组织的活动，应当严格地而且充分自觉地履行党员的义务。但是不然。他对政治学习没有兴趣，从来不大看学习文件，即使在规定的学习时间之内。党的会议，他不愿参加；党的组织生活，他感到厌倦。几年来，由于他的主张和坚持，安全监察局的党的小组会议，多是占用工作时间——他不肯“牺牲”自己的业余时间。他参加党的会议，常常带着烦躁的心情，开会之前问：“又开什么会？”开会中间说：“没有什么了不起的事！还不是那一套！”“谁还不了解谁，哪有那样多的意见！”严肃的会议，他看成了最大的负担。
    最能表现他和党的关系的，还是在交党费问题上。
    长期以来，张文每当领到薪金的时候，他就从薪金袋里抽出一张五元的钞票，让党小组长和工会小组长“分配”：三元五角交党费，一元五角交工会会费。但是，按照他的收入，按照规定，五元是不够的：党费不足，会费也少些。党的小组长当然不能同意，去找他让他缴足。可是，张文非常蛮横，每次都要发生争吵。为了这件事，他竟向党小组长发过五次脾气，他甚至还说：“交党费是自愿（？）！”“你们像资本家要账的一样！”
  “过去受资本家压迫，现在受共产党压迫！”……。有一次吵得太过份了，竟有一位普通工作人员要拿出钱来为张文垫足党费！
    张文！你究竟还算不算一个党员？把党看成了什么！三十年的老党员，竟在思想上这样糟糕，那你怎样理解党章的规定的，你又是怎样理解党员的义务的？
      志趣的一斑
    既然对一切都淡漠乏味，那么，张文有些什么志趣呢？说来也许不会相信，许多人竟不能作出答案。但是，有人也揭开了他的一些秘密。
    翻开“煤炭工业”月刊，连续几期上都有张文署名的文章。但是，了解内情的人们知道，这并不是出自张文之手，而是监察局其他同志劳动的结果。这些同志写了文章，请张文审阅；张文作了极少的修改（有一篇只加了四个字，最后还被刊物编辑删去了），却加上了自己的名字，并且强分稿费。一直到整风第三阶段开始，煤炭工业部整风领导小组发出通报以后，他才把稿费退了出来。
    在别人的文章上署名，张文还不止是为了分得稿费。在他去大同出差的时候，他竟问当地监察局的工作人员：“看到我的文章没有？”洋洋自得地炫耀自己。
    用别人的劳动来换取享受和名誉是不光荣的，这种志趣实际是一种极恶劣的剥削阶级思想。一只脚跨出了党的大门
    张文是煤矿工人出身，他的父亲也是煤矿工人。他在1927年参加中国共产党，曾经担任过党的地下交通员，县委组织部长，华北煤矿管理局生产处处长和管理局副局长。在那些紧张斗争艰苦时日里，他曾经冒着生命的危险，日日夜夜地为党工作；在煤矿管理局，他也曾深入现场，钻研生产，在工作中有所建树。可是，在今天这一切并没有成为督促他不断前进的力量，他陶醉于自己的资格老，出身好，为党作过些工作，并以此而自恃，而停滞不前，而故步自封。很多曾经和他在一起工作过的同志，随着革命事业的发展，大踏步前进了，他不是借以激励自己，而是牢骚满腹，抱怨组织。对那些党龄不如他长的领导同志，他竟采取了对抗和轻蔑的态度。党发现了他的一系列的错误，为了挽救他，曾经找他谈话，党支部和党小组也曾为他开会，给他以批评和教育。可是，这一切并没有使他猛醒悔悟；他拒绝帮助，怨恨揭发他的错误的同志，甚至对同志们大发脾气，说什么“你们不如说我是反革命，台湾派来的……”。
    到这里，张文的一只脚已经跨出了党的大门。什么是党的事业，哪里是前进的方向，一个人的生命应当怎样使用才有价值，这一切，张文已经丧失了辨别能力？他没有了理想，爱憎在他身上也失去了明显的界限。就这样，无端的自负，无穷的抱怨，加上自己在身上撒下的自私自利的霉菌的蔓延，就使得这个曾经从战斗中走过来的有着三十年党龄的人，完全丧失了朝气，政治生命慢慢地枯萎了下来。
    张文用自己的行为表明，他正在向悬崖之边跨出最后的一步。谁能来挽救他呢，除了党，就是他自己。
