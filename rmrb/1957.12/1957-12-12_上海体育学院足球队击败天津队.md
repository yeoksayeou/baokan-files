Xinhua News Agency, December 11th. The Tianjin team, which had been sailing smoothly in the National Football League A League, was defeated by the Shanghai Institute of Physical Education team with a score of 1-2 today in Shanghai, during the second-round December matches. This unexpected defeat has greatly threatened the team's hope of winning the league championship.

Although Tianjin team's center forward, Jin Changji, scored the first goal with a wonderful "bicycle kick" eight minutes into the second half, the team's subsequent attack was weak and the defense was negligent. Within eight minutes, from the fifteenth to the twenty-second minute, two inside forwards of the Shanghai Institute of Physical Education team successively kicked two goals from the same angle on the left side.

Another match held in Shanghai today was won by the Beijing team with a score of 3-1 against the Hongqi Sports Association team (the score in the first half was 2-0).

Currently, the Beijing team has become the team with the greatest hope of winning the league championship. They have achieved a record of five wins and three draws in eight matches in the second round, and are the only team that has not been defeated.

　　上海体育学院足球队击败天津队
    据新华社11日讯　在全国足球甲级队联赛中一帆风顺的天津队，今天在上海参加第二循环12月份的比赛时，以一比二败给了上海体育学院队。这场出人意料的败局，使这个队取得联赛冠军的希望，受到了很大的威胁。
    天津队中锋金昌吉在下半场八分钟时，虽然以一脚精彩的“倒钩”首开纪录，可是后来全队进攻不力，后卫又防守疏忽，在十五分钟到二十二分的八分钟内，竟被上海体育学院队的两个内锋，先后从左边同一个角度踢进了两个球。
    今天在上海举行的另一场比赛，是北京队以三比一胜红旗体育协会队（上半场的比数是二比零）。
    目前，北京队已经成为获得联赛冠军希望最大的一个队。他们在第二循环比赛中已经取得了八战五胜三平的战绩，是唯一没有败过的队。
