Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 6th (Reporter Zhu Zemin): Why do people have to queue to buy things? This question sparked a fierce debate among residents of Taipingzhuang Street in Nankai District, Tianjin, during the socialist education movement.

More than 400 households live on this street, and the majority of residents participating in the movement are housewives. During the airing of views and debates, the discussion invariably turned to the issue of queuing to buy things. Housewife Li Guizhen once brought up the queuing issue and said with dissatisfaction, "In the old society, we waited our turn to buy things, and in the new society, we still wait our turn. When will we ever get ahead?" This question quickly sparked debate among the housewives. Zhao Lianhui, a woman in her fifties, couldn't contain herself when she heard this. She said, "In the past, we waited our turn because we were poor; now we wait our turn because we are prosperous. During the period of enemy and puppet rule, my eldest daughter queued up in the middle of the night to buy millet that was full of rat droppings. People got sick from eating it, so I had to use it to stuff pillows. This happened more than ten years ago. Now we queue up to buy rice and meat. How can you say it's the same?"

When the emancipated working people recall queuing in the old society, they all have a bellyful of bitterness. During the Kuomintang rule, Liu Shuzhen's seven-year-old daughter queued up on a freezing winter night to buy corn flour. She froze all night and died of illness a few days later. At the debate, she said, "If my child were alive today, she would be seventeen years old. Would my daughter have died if this were now?" Housewife Xu Shufen recalled how her second son was beaten black and blue by puppet police when he queued up in the middle of the night to buy corn flour. She said with excitement, "In the past, queuing was torture for the poor. Now my family has an income of more than 200 yuan a month, and I queue up to buy meat. What a huge change!" Through this debate, everyone clearly saw the earth-shaking changes that have taken place in the new society.

After clarifying the difference between queuing in the old and new societies, some people still didn't understand why there is still queuing in socialist society. Housewife Zhang Guilan said at the debate, "In the past, you could buy meat even if you went in the middle of the night, but now it's gone after ten o'clock in the morning. This must mean that there are fewer goods than before." This was a new question: Is the queuing phenomenon caused by a decrease in the goods supplied today compared to the past? So everyone started a new debate. Tong Enrong, the director of the residents' committee and a retired veteran worker, calculated an account of meat consumption in front of everyone: During the period of enemy and puppet rule, his monthly salary was only enough for seven days of living. After work, he had to sell cigarettes to barely support the living expenses of his family of five or six. At that time, let alone eating meat, even giving the children cornmeal buns for the New Year's Eve was considered a treat. Now, with the salaries of his two sons plus his pension of more than 50 yuan, his monthly income is more than 200 yuan, and he can eat meat fifteen times a month. He said, "In the past, few people ate meat, but now even I eat meat fifteen times a month. Is there more or less meat now?" Housewife Zhu Shuzhen also calculated an account of cloth consumption. She said, "My husband used to have only one cotton-padded coat, but now he has four, and also a leather coat. My daughter-in-law wears corduroy pants. Is there less cloth now?"

After everyone calculated the detailed accounts, Zhang Guilan also understood: It's not that there are fewer goods, but that everyone is eating meat and wearing more clothes now. With so many people buying things, the queuing phenomenon appears. This precisely shows that people's lives are getting better day by day.

After everyone clarified the reasons for the queuing phenomenon today, they launched a discussion on "how to deal with the queuing problem." Many residents expressed that they should not create artificial tension. Many people examined the bad habit of "rushing to buy things," squeezing to buy things more when there are fewer goods. Aunt Cao Yunqing said at the debate, "The prices of goods are not increasing now, and you can buy them whenever you want. Why do you always have to squeeze and queue?" Many housewives also proposed specific solutions. Pan Xiuqing believed, "Rice and flour are essential, but brown sugar and meat are optional. If it's crowded, don't buy it; buy it when it's not crowded. If everyone does this, there will be fewer queues." Workers' family members Ni Chunfang and Xia Fenglan suggested that housewives should not buy grain in small quantities every day. They said, "Workers get their salaries in full amounts. If we buy grain in small quantities every day, it takes time and makes the stores look crowded. This is not good for managing daily life." So many people proposed three no-queuing principles: no queuing when there are many people, no queuing when there are few goods, and no queuing when you already have it at home. Now, the congestion and long queues in front of several cooperatives and stores on Taipingzhuang Street have become much less frequent.

### 过去是穷排队　现在是富排队  天津太平庄街居民认清了买东西为什么要排队

　　过去是穷排队　现在是富排队
    天津太平庄街居民认清了买东西为什么要排队
    据新华社天津6日电　新华社记者朱泽民报道：买东西为什么要排队？这个问题在天津南开区太平庄街居民开展社会主义教育运动时引起了一场激烈的辩论。
    这条街上住着四百多户人家，参加运动的绝大部分居民都是家庭妇女，在鸣放和辩论会上一扯就扯到买东西排队问题。家庭妇女李桂珍有一次提起排队的事不满意地说：“旧社会买东西挨个，新社会也挨个，什么时候才挨出个头来？”这个问题，很快引起家庭妇女们的辩论。五十多岁的赵连慧大娘一听就沉不住气了，她说：“过去是穷挨个，现在是富挨个。我大女儿在敌伪统治时期深更半夜排队买来的谷子，里面带着老鼠屎，人吃了就中毒，我只好用它装了枕头，这话有十多年了。现在挨个买大米、买肉，这怎么能说是一样呢？”
    提起旧社会的排队，翻身的劳动人民都有一肚子苦水。在国民党统治时期，刘淑贞七岁的女儿在数九寒天的夜里去排队买玉米面，一夜就冻坏了，没几天得病死了，她在辩论会上说：“孩子活着现在十七岁了，这要是在现在，我的闺女还能死吗？”家庭妇女徐淑芬回忆她的二儿子半夜排队买玉米面被伪警察打的鼻青脸肿的情况时，激动地说：“过去排队是穷人活受罪，现在我家一月收入二百多元，排队去买肉，这是多大的变化？”经过这场辩论大家都鲜明地看到了新社会所发生的翻天覆地的变化。
    闹清了新旧社会排队的不同，有的人还不明白：为什么社会主义还有排队的现象。家庭妇女张桂兰在辩论会上说：“过去半夜买肉也能买到，现在一过早晨十点就没有了，这一定是东西比过去少了。”这又是个新问题：今天供应的东西是不是比过去少了才造成了排队现象？于是大家又开展了辩论。居民委员会主任、退休老工人佟恩荣在大家面前算了一笔吃肉的帐：在敌伪统治时期，他一个月工资只够七天生活，下了班还得去卖烟卷，饥一顿饱一顿地维持着一家五、六口人的吃喝，那时候，别说吃肉，大年三十给孩子们吃口棒子面饽饽就算解了馋。现在，两个儿子工资加上他的五十多元养老金，每月收入二百多元，一个月能吃十五顿肉。他说：“过去吃肉的人少，现在连我一个月都吃十五顿肉，这是肉多了还是少了呢？”家庭妇女朱淑珍也算了一笔用布的帐，她说：“我丈夫过去只有一件棉袄，现在有四件，还有一件皮袄，儿媳妇穿灯心绒的裤子，这是布少了吗？”
    经过大家算细帐，张桂兰也明白了：并不是东西少了，而是现在大家都吃肉了，穿的也多了，买东西的人一多，就出现了排队现象。这正说明了人民的生活在一天天好起来。
    大家明确了现在产生排队现象的原因以后，又围绕“如何对待排队问题”展开讨论。很多居民表示不要制造人为的紧张。很多人检查了买东西“乱起哄”，东西越少越挤着买的不良作风。曹云清大娘在辩论会上说：“现在东西不涨钱，什么时候买都行，为什么总得挤着去排队？”很多家庭妇女还提出了具体办法。潘秀清认为：“米面不吃饿得慌，红糖和肉可吃可不吃，人挤的时候就不买，不挤再买，大家都这样，排队的就少了。”工人家属倪春芳和夏凤兰建议家庭妇女们以后别零买粮食，她们说：“工人工资发整的，我们天天零买粮食，又占工夫，又显着门市部总挤着是人，这样对过日子也计划不好。”于是很多人提出了三不排队：人多不排队、东西少不排队、家里有的不排队。现在，太平庄街几个合作社和门市部门前拥挤和排长队的情况已经很少了。
