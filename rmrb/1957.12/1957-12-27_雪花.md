    Snowflake
    Please select four small squares from these sixteen small squares and place a snowflake in each of them (the snowflakes in the picture are enlarged, the squares should be larger than the snowflakes), so that each row, column, and diagonal line has one snowflake.
  　How to make snowflakes:
    Use a circular piece of paper, fold it in half to form a semicircle, fold the semicircle into three equal parts, then fold it again (making the entire circle into twelve equal parts), and cut it with scissors as shown in the small picture to make a snowflake. It would be even more convenient to play with if you stick it on cardboard. You should make four identical snowflakes.
    This game can also be played using four other objects instead of snowflakes. (Attached image)

    雪花
    请你从这十六个小方格中，选出四个小方格，在里面各摆上一片雪花（图中是放大了的雪花，方格应该比雪花大），使每一横排、直行和两条对角线上都各有一片。
  　雪花的做法：
    用一块圆形纸，对面折成半圆形，将半圆折成三等分，对面折一次（使整个圆成为十二等分），照小图的样子用剪刀剪下就成了雪花。如果把它贴在硬纸上，玩起来就更方便。同样的雪花应该制四片。
    这个游戏，不用雪花而用四个别的东西代替，也可以玩。（附图片）
