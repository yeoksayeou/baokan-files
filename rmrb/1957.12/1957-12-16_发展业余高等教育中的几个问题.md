Our country has always attached great importance to the work of cultivating its own technical cadres from the working class. In recent years, in order to continuously strengthen the ranks of the working class's own technical cadres and to cultivate them into red experts without detaching them from their production and work posts, our country has established 180 amateur higher education institutions with 90,000 students. This learning method, which does not detach people from production and work, has been enthusiastically welcomed by the vast number of on-the-job cadres, teachers, and workers. Students participating in amateur higher education generally have high enthusiasm for learning, are able to overcome difficulties, persevere, and achieve relatively good results. According to the experience of running amateur higher education in recent years, whether it is a night school department or correspondence department attached to a higher education institution, or an independent amateur higher education institution run by a large factory or mine, or directly by a business department, it has cultivated many skilled specialized talents. Some students who graduated from amateur higher education institutions in the past few years have played a certain role in improving their professional level, whether in production and work posts or in government work.

According to preliminary research by the Ministry of Higher Education and various business departments, in order to basically complete the major political task of cultivating a strong scientific and technical cadre team of our own working class within the next ten to fifteen years, in addition to striving to implement the class line in regular higher education, it is also necessary to vigorously develop amateur higher education.

Amateur higher education in our country is still a relatively new endeavor, and we have accumulated little experience. At present, there are still many problems that urgently need to be solved.

First, the issue of implementing the class line in amateur higher education. In recent years, our amateur higher education work has only focused on training general on-the-job cadres, and has not well implemented the policy of opening the door to workers and peasants, focusing on training old cadres of worker and peasant origin. In many amateur higher education institutions, only the enrollment of undergraduate students has been emphasized, while not enough attention has been paid to running special classes for old worker and peasant cadres and enrolling old worker and peasant cadres with junior high school graduation or above. Some schools that have established special classes for old cadres have mostly failed to tailor their teaching to the characteristics of old cadres. We know that old cadres generally have rich work or production experience, they have been accustomed to the learning method of combining theory with practice for many years, they are relatively busy with work, and their foundation is relatively poor. Therefore, teaching methods should be diverse. The teaching plan for special classes needs to have its own characteristics, textbooks can be specially compiled, and teaching methods should also be adapted to the situation of old cadres. Only by conscientiously implementing the class line can we better train a group of skilled technical backbones of the working class.

Second, how to ensure the time for amateur study for the majority of students is an important issue in the current amateur higher education work. Party committees at all levels need to give full support and attention in this regard. In order to ensure that the students' amateur study time is guaranteed in a practical and reliable manner, time should be arranged reasonably. The number of class hours per week for night school undergraduates should not be less than nine, and the self-study time should not be less than nine hours. Correspondence undergraduates need at least sixteen to eighteen hours of self-study time per week, and the study for special classes for old cadres should be allowed to occupy a part of work time. In the future, we can also consider gradually establishing a part-work, part-study system (appropriately deducting a part of the students' wages), so that the time for amateur study can not only be guaranteed, but the length of study can also be shortened. For students participating in amateur higher education, it is even more important to cherish time and use all available time to study.

Third, the issue of faculty in amateur higher education institutions. The general situation at present is that the quantity is insufficient and the quality is low. Although many amateur higher education institutions have a part of full-time teachers, they account for a very small proportion of the teachers, and most of them are part-time teachers from higher education institutions and engineering technicians. In order to improve the quality of teaching, it is necessary to equip a team of full-time teachers of sufficient quantity, especially teachers for basic courses and basic technical courses. In the future, in addition to continuing to rely on the existing teachers and engineering technicians of higher education institutions, business departments, and factories and mines for part-time teaching, we should also appropriately supplement some outstanding university graduates to participate in teaching work. In this round of streamlining institutions and transferring personnel to lower levels in various regions, in addition to higher education institutions paying attention to supplementing a certain number of teaching backbones for their affiliated night school departments and correspondence departments, provinces and cities should also supplement teachers with teaching experience and leading backbones to the locally independently established amateur higher education institutions as much as possible, in order to strengthen leadership and improve quality.

In addition, issues such as the leadership relationship and funding of amateur higher education institutions should also be properly resolved according to the specific situation to adapt to the needs of the continuous development of amateur higher education. In the future, in order to enable the vast number of on-the-job cadres, industrial workers, agricultural cooperative cadres, and outstanding members with junior high school or high school education to better study science and technology and specialized business by using their spare time or occupying a part of their work time, in addition to large factories and mines and enterprises with conditions should hold amateur higher education as much as possible, higher education institutions across the country should also adapt to the urgent requirements of cultivating their own scientific and technical team of the working class, and take active measures to carry out correspondence education.

    发展业余高等教育中的几个问题
　　本报评论员
    我们国家对于培养工人阶级自己的技术干部的工作，一向是十分重视的。几年来，为了不断壮大工人阶级自己的技术干部的队伍，使他们在不脱离生产和工作岗位的情况下，培养成为红色专家，我们国家已经举办了业余高等学校一百八十所，在校学生已有九万人。这种不脱离生产和工作的学习方式，已经受到广大在职干部、教师和工人的热烈欢迎。参加业余高等学校学习的学员，一般学习热情都很高，能够克服困难，坚持下去，取得了比较优良的成绩。根据几年来办理业余高等教育的情况来看，无论是附设在高等学校的夜校部或函授部，还是大型厂矿举办的、或直接由业务部门办理的独立的业余高等学校，已经培养出不少熟练的专门人材。过去几年从业余高等学校毕业出来的一些学生，无论在生产工作岗位上或是机关工作中，对提高业务水平方面，都发挥了一定的作用。
    根据高等教育部和各业务部门的初步研究，为了在今后十年到十五年内，基本上完成培养一支强大的工人阶级自己的科学技术干部队伍的重大政治任务，除了在正规高等学校教育中努力贯彻执行阶级路线外，还必须大力发展业余高等教育。
    我国业余高等教育还是一项比较新的工作，积累的经验还很少，目前还有许多问题迫切需要解决。
    首先，关于在业余高等教育中贯彻执行阶级路线的问题。几年来，我们的业余高等教育工作只着重培养了一般在职干部，而没有很好地贯彻执行向工农开门的方针，着重培养工农出身的老干部。在许多业余高等学校中，都只强调了招收本科生，而对举办工农老干部特别班，招收具有初中毕业以上程度的工农老干部则注意的很不够。有些举办了老干部特别班的学校，也大多没能很好地针对老干部的特点进行教学。我们知道，老干部的工作或生产经验一般都比较丰富，他们多年来习惯于理论联系实际的学习方法，工作比较忙，基础比较差，因此，教学方式要多种多样。特别班的教学计划需要有它的特点，教材可以专门编写，教学方法也要适应老干部的情况。只有认真贯彻执行阶级路线，才能更好地培养出一批工人阶级自己的熟练的技术骨干来。
    第二，如何保证大多数学员的业余学习的时间问题，这是目前业余高等教育工作中的一个重要问题。各级党委在这方面需要给予充分的支持和重视。为了要使学员业余学习的时间得到切实可靠的保证，就要合理地安排时间。夜校本科每周上课时数不能少于九学时，自学时间也不能少于九学时，函授本科生每周自学时间至少需要十六到十八小时，老干部特别班的学习应该允许占用一部分工作时间。将来还可以考虑逐步建立半工半读的制度（适当地扣除学员一部分工资），这样业余学习的时间不但可以得到保证，学习年限也可以缩短。对于参加业余高等学校学习的学员来说，更要珍惜时间，利用一切可以利用的时间去学习。
    第三，关于业余高等学校的师资问题。目前一般的情况是数量不足，质量较低。虽然许多业余高等学校都有一部分专职教师，但是在教师中所占比例很小，大部分都是高等学校和工程技术人员兼课的。为了提高教学质量，配备一支足够数量的专职教师的队伍是很必要的，特别是基础课和基础技术课的师资。今后除了继续依靠高等学校、业务部门和厂矿企业的现有教师和工程技术人员兼课外，还应该适当地补充一些优秀的大学毕业生参加教学工作。在这次各地精简机构、人员下放中，除了高等学校应该注意为其附设夜校部、函授部补充一定的教学骨干外；同时各省市对当地独立设置的业余高等学校要尽可能补充具有教学经验的教师和领导骨干，以便加强领导、提高质量。
    此外，关于业余高等学校的领导关系和经费等问题，也应该根据具体情况妥善地解决，以适应业余高等教育的不断发展的需要。今后为使广大的在职干部、产业工人、农业合作社干部以及优秀的社员中具有初中或高中程度的人，利用业余时间或占用一部分工作时间，更好地学习科学技术和专门业务，除了有条件的大型厂矿、企业要尽可能举办业余高等教育外，全国各高等学校也要适应培养工人阶级自己的科学技术队伍的迫切要求，采取积极的措施开展函授教育。
