Recently, according to reflections from many regions, farmers planting certain economic crops is more profitable than planting food crops, but the agricultural tax burden ratio for economic crops appears to be too low compared with the agricultural tax burden ratio for food crops, and needs to be adjusted. At the same time, the expenditures of several urgently needed local public welfare undertakings are also increasing day by day. Therefore, local governments have requested to increase the agricultural tax surcharge ratio for certain economic crops to balance the burden and solve some of the actual local needs. In accordance with the principle in Item 4 of the Provisions on Improving the Financial Management System that "the agricultural tax surcharge in economic crop areas can be appropriately increased," the State Council agrees with these opinions of the local governments and now makes the following provisions:

(1) In areas where the planting of economic crops and horticultural crops is relatively concentrated and the profits exceed those of planting food crops by a large margin, the People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government may appropriately increase the agricultural tax surcharge ratio for these economic crops and horticultural crops, but the maximum shall not exceed 30% of the regular tax amount.

(2) For economic crops planted sporadically, economic crops planted in mountainous areas, economic crops that have just begun to be promoted, or economic crops that are relatively concentrated in planting but whose profits do not exceed those of food crops by much, the agricultural tax surcharge ratio should not be increased, or should be increased less.

	In order to encourage farmers, especially farmers in mountainous areas, to actively develop production, the "Regulations on Reduction and Exemption of Agricultural Tax for Newly Developed and Transplanted Mulberry Gardens, Orchards, Tea Gardens and Other Economic Forests" promulgated by the State Council on November 20, 1956, should be implemented for newly opened, newly reclaimed, and newly cultivated mulberry gardens, tea gardens, orchards, and other economic forests.

(3) The specific ratio of increasing the agricultural tax surcharge for economic crops, the scope of the increase, and the time of implementation shall be specifically stipulated by the People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government on the premise of not affecting the normal development of economic crops. If the People's Committees of some provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government believe that it is not necessary to increase, they may not increase it.

(4) In the work of increasing the agricultural tax surcharge ratio for economic crops, attention should be paid to proper arrangements, strengthening publicity, explaining the reasons to farmers, and not engaging in simple actions, so as to avoid hurting farmers' enthusiasm for economic crop production.

    国务院关于调整获利较大的经济作物的农业税附加比例的规定
    （一九五七年十二月七日全国人民代表大会常务委员会第八十七次会议通过）
    最近根据不少地区反映，农民种植某些经济作物比种植粮食作物获利较大，而经济作物的农业税负担比例，同粮食作物的农业税负担比例相比较，则显得过低，需要加以调整；同时，若干急需兴办的地方性公益事业的支出又日益增加，因此，地方政府要求提高某些经济作物的农业税附加比例，以平衡负担，并且解决地方的一部分实际需要。根据关于改进财政管理体制的规定第四项中“经济作物区的农业税附加可以酌量提高”的原则，国务院同意地方政府的这些意见，现在作如下规定：
    （一）种植经济作物和园艺作物比较集中而获利又超过种植粮食作物较多的地区，省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会对于这些经济作物和园艺作物的农业税附加比例可以酌情提高，但是最高不得超过正税税额的30％。
    （二）对于零星种植的经济作物、在山地种植的经济作物、刚开始推广的经济作物、或者种植虽然比较集中但是获利超过粮食作物不多的经济作物，农业税附加的比例不要提高，或者少提高一些。
    为了鼓励农民特别是山区农民积极发展生产，对于新开辟的、新垦复的和新栽培的桑园、茶园、果园以及其他经济林木，应当按照国务院1956年11月20日发布的“关于新辟和移植桑园、果园、茶园和其他经济林木减免农业税的规定”执行。
    （三）提高经济作物的农业税附加的具体比例，提高的范围和开始实行的时间，由省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会在不影响经济作物正常发展的前提下具体规定。如果有的省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会认为没有必要提高的，也可以不提高。
    （四）在提高经济作物的农业税附加比例这一工作当中，要注意妥善安排，加强宣传，对农民讲清道理，不要简单从事，以免伤害农民对经济作物生产的积极性。
