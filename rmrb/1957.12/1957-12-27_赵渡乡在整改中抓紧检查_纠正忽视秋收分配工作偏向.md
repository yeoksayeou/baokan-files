    Zhao Du Township Hastens Inspection During Rectification
    Correcting Deviation of Neglecting Autumn Harvest Distribution Work
    (Our dispatch) The Zhao Du Township Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jintang County, Sichuan Province, in the previous period was busy discussing the agricultural program, rectification, and production work, and relaxed leadership over the year-end accounting and distribution work. As a result, many problems existed in the distribution work that were not resolved in time: Thirty-one cooperatives had mostly not checked inventory, clarified actual output, or handled bonus and penalty issues related to contracted work and output; some cooperatives had not cleared labor work points. Puli Second Cooperative rented and damaged many farm tools of its members, and so far the cooperative cadres still do not know how much rent should be paid and compensated to whom. More than twenty cooperatives such as Zhonghe, Yongli, and Jialing have not yet determined how much public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, and reserve grain should be retained, without discussion and determination by all cooperative members.
    After the Zhao Du Township Party Branch conducted an in-depth inspection, it immediately convened a meeting of the directors and deputy directors of the thirty-one cooperatives, focusing on pointing out the serious deviation of generally neglecting distribution work at present, educating the cooperative cadres to recognize the importance of doing a good job in final accounting and distribution to encourage cooperative members' enthusiasm for labor and production, and consolidate the cooperatives, and requiring them to strengthen leadership over distribution work and quickly correct this deviation. After discussion, everyone agreed that "the key lies in strengthening leadership." It was decided to go back to clear assets, clear work points, and reconcile accounts with cooperative members. Issues such as public accumulation, mutual benefit policies, bonuses and penalties for contracted work and output, and care for poor households should also be studied in a timely manner and preliminary opinions should be put forward. At the same time, a major debate should be launched among the cooperative members on the following issues: Is it better for agricultural cooperatives to retain more and distribute less, or to distribute more and retain less? Is it better for cooperative members to invest more and borrow less, or to invest less and borrow more? Is it better to help solve the difficulties and achieve common prosperity for the "five guarantees" households, poor households, and those with less labor and more population, or to kick them out of the cooperative? How should the shortcomings in implementing mutual benefit policies be corrected and resolved? Through debate, raise awareness and finally make a decision. The cadres attending the meeting believed that only by mobilizing the masses could the final accounting and distribution work be done well, and all expressed that they would take immediate action after returning to the cooperatives.

    赵渡乡在整改中抓紧检查
    纠正忽视秋收分配工作偏向
    本报讯　四川金堂县赵渡乡，前段时期忙于讨论农业纲要、整改和生产工作，对全年的决算分配工作放松领导，以致分配工作中存在很多问题没有及时解决：三十一个社大都没有盘查库存、清实产量、处理包工包产的奖赔问题；部分社没有清理劳动工分。普利二社租用和损坏了社员很多农具，至今社干部还弄不清该付多少租金和赔偿给谁。中河、永利、加零等二十多个社对该提留多少公积金、公益金、储备粮，尚未经全体社员讨论确定下来。
    中共赵渡乡总支深入进行检查以后，立即召开了三十一个社的正副主任会议，着重指出当前普遍忽视分配工作的严重偏向，教育社干部认识搞好决算分配对鼓励社员劳动生产热情、巩固社的重要性，要求加强对分配工作的领导，迅速纠正这种偏向。经过讨论，大家一致认为：“关键在于加强领导”。决定回去清理资产，清理工分，和社员核对账目。对于公共积累、互利政策及包工包产的奖赔、贫困户的照顾等问题也要及时进行研究，并提出初步意见。同时还应在社员群众中对以下问题展开大辩论：农业社是多留少分好，还是多分少留好？社员多投资少借支好还是少投资多借支好？对五保户、贫困户、劳力少人口多的是帮助解决困难共同富裕好，还是踢出合作社好？贯彻执行互利政策中的缺点应如何改正解决？通过辩论提高认识，最后作出决定。与会干部认为只有发动群众，才能将决算分配工作作好，都表示回社后要立即行动起来。
