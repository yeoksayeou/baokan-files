    Shanxi Province Rich in Asbestos
    Shanxi Province has abundant asbestos reserves. According to existing data, the reserves in thirteen counties including Anyi and Xiaxian in southern Shanxi, Daixian and Hunyuan in northern Shanxi, and Zuoquan and Lishan in central Shanxi are considerable, with many outcrops. The area of dozens of square kilometers between Qingniankou and Xiaguan in Lingqiu County is entirely an asbestos mining area, with reserves of approximately 6,000 tons per square kilometer.
