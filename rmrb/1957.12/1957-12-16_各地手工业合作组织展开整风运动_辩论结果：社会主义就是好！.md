Xinhua News Agency, December 15th—More than 5,000 handicraft cooperatives (groups) in Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Jilin, Hebei, Shanxi, Gansu, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Fujian and other provinces and cities have launched rectification movements.

The cooperatives conducting extensive debates generally focus on the following issues: whether cooperatives are better than individual farming, whether socialism is better than capitalism; the relationship between the state and cooperatives, between cooperatives and members, between producers and consumers, and between industry and agriculture; the relationship between democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline; and whether or not to have Party leadership. Among these, the debates focus on the two roads of socialism and capitalism and the issue of Party leadership.

Since the second half of last year, due to the influence of spontaneous capitalist forces, a small number of members have privately engaged in "underground factories," and many people envied the speculative life of "earning three to four hundred yuan by just shaking their arms" and the so-called "free" life of individual households, demanding to withdraw from the cooperatives; a considerable number of members also lacked a clear understanding of the future of cooperation and were very confused ideologically. This situation became increasingly serious in the first half of this year. Cooperatives that have carried out extensive debates and criticized capitalist ideology have changed this chaotic situation and made the cooperatives more solid. In the past, many members in Guangzhou envied individual businesses for their so-called "five freedoms," namely: freedom of tax payment, freedom of product prices, freedom of quality standards, freedom of hiring workers, and freedom of wages. After debating the two roads, they realized that these "freedoms" are essentially capitalist exploitation behaviors that harm the interests of consumers and violate government policies and regulations, and therefore resolutely abandoned the capitalist road. Some members also summarized the seven major benefits of cooperatives, such as having a promising future, stable production and life for members, good learning conditions, and rapid improvement of technical skills, strengthening their confidence in taking the socialist road.

Whether in the debate stage or the rectification stage, the cooperatives have shown a new look in production. After the Yimin Ironware Cooperative in Chengguan, Xin County, Shandong Province launched a debate, the attendance rate reached 100%, eliminating phenomena such as lateness, early departure, and absenteeism. Member Wang Shilin said: "You won't know if you don't speak, and you won't penetrate wood if you don't drill it. This debate has clarified my mind, and the cooperative is my home." In the past, he complained of being tired after producing eight three-pronged hoes a day, but now he produces fifteen a day, and the defect rate has dropped from 20% to 3%. In the first half of the year, Tianjin No. 1 Tool and Farm Machinery Cooperative failed to complete its production plan for six consecutive months due to the ideological confusion and lax labor discipline of many members, but it launched a debate in July and overfulfilled the production plan in August. Cooperatives in the rectification stage generally made improvements based on the opinions raised by members during the airing of views, addressing shortcomings in cadre work style, production and financial management, wages and benefits, etc., which encouraged the production enthusiasm of the members.

    各地手工业合作组织展开整风运动
    辩论结果：社会主义就是好！
    据新华社15日讯　北京、天津、广州、吉林、河北、山西、甘肃、河南、湖北、湖南、广西、山东、江苏、福建等省市，已有五千多个手工业合作社（组）展开整风运动。
    进行大辩论的合作社，一般以下面几个问题作为辩论的中心：合作社好还是单干好，社会主义好还是资本主义好；国家和合作社、合作社和社员、生产者和消费者、工业和农业的关系；民主和集中、自由和纪律的关系；要不要党的领导等。其中又着重于社会主义和资本主义两条道路和党的领导问题的辩论。
    从去年下半年起，由于资本主义自发势力的影响，少数社员私自搞“地下工厂”，不少人羡慕那种“晃晃膀子也能赚个三二百块”的投机生涯和单干户的所谓“自由”生活，要求退出合作社；还有相当一部分社员对合作化的前途认识不清楚，思想很混乱。这些情况今年上半年发展的越来越严重。开展了大辩论和对资本主义思想进行批判的合作社，已经改变这种混乱局面，使合作社更加巩固了。广州市许多社员过去羡慕个体户的所谓“五大自由”，即：交税自由，产品价格自由，质量规格自由，雇工自由，工资自由，经过两条道路的辩论，认识到这些“自由”实质上是损害消费者的利益、违反政府政策法令的资本主义剥削行为，因而坚决唾弃了资本主义道路；有的社员还总结了合作社有前途远大、社员生产和生活稳定、学习条件好、技术水平提高的快等七大好处，坚定了走社会主义道路的信心。
    无论是处在辩论阶段或整改阶段的合作社，生产上都出现了新的面貌。山东莘县城关益民铁业社在开展辩论后，出勤率达到百分之百，消灭了迟到、早退、旷工等现象。社员王世林说：“话不说不知，木不钻不透，这一辩论心里亮堂了，合作社就是俺的家。”他过去每天生产八把三齿还叫累，现在每天生产十五把，次品率由20％下降到3％。天津第一工具农械社上半年因为不少社员思想混乱，劳动纪律松弛，曾经连续六个月没有完成生产计划，可是7月份展开辩论，8月份就超额全面地完成了生产计划。处在整改阶段的合作社，一般根据社员在鸣放中提出的意见，就干部作风、生产财务管理、工资福利等方面的缺点，作了改进，鼓舞了社员们的生产热情。
