　　University Students Should Have the Ambition of Revolutionaries
　　You Bin
    Recently, many university students have actively participated in physical labor such as helping farmers with production and cleaning classrooms and dormitories on campus during their spare time. Most people have learned from practice the glory and arduousness of labor, gained a lot ideologically, and felt happy and comfortable. However, a few students have been passive, considering it a burden and saying, "After participating in physical labor, I only feel tired and bitter and cannot see how it helps with ideological transformation."
    Hearing these words, one cannot help but ask: Why do some students constantly say "labor is glorious and great" but then complain about being tired and bitter when they actually participate in labor? This has a lot to do with students' views on fatigue and bitterness.
    Participating in physical labor is indeed more tiring and bitter, but the problem is not here, but in how to understand this fatigue and bitterness. For revolutionary students, feeling tired after labor should be considered progress, because in the past, students "couldn't distinguish between the five grains and didn't exercise their limbs," "couldn't lift with their shoulders or carry with their hands," and didn't know what labor tasted like at all. When they participate in labor and feel sore backs and aching muscles, as long as they recognize the meaning of labor, they will gradually appreciate the arduousness of labor, develop feelings for physical labor, and have a common language with the working people. In this way, they will usually cherish the fruits of labor, save state property, and consider the interests and demands of the working people. This is a great leap forward in the ideology of intellectuals. At the same time, how excited and happy they will be when they feel they have really done something for the working people! Then they will taste the real "sweetness" from the "bitterness." Conversely, those who only understand bitterness and fatigue literally, those who despise labor and the working people, those who only enjoy the fruits of others' labor, those who "do unto others what they do not want done to themselves," will only feel physical fatigue and mental pain in labor. They will not be able to obtain what they should obtain in labor—communist ideology and qualities—and they will not be able to discard what they should discard—bourgeois ideology (and these dirty thoughts must be discarded). Naturally, their minds are empty, and so-called "comfort" and "happiness" are only temporary illusions for them.
    Participating in physical labor can transform one's ideology, but it does not mean that as long as one participates in physical labor, one's ideology will definitely be transformed well. It is not as simple as dyeing something in a dye vat, where you can get a good dye job simply by jumping in. To transform one's ideology well in labor, one must have a correct understanding of physical labor, an urgent desire to transform one's ideology, and the ambition of a revolutionary to overcome all difficulties. Those who only seek shortcuts, who seek what suits their comfortable and easy tastes, will only be scared away by bitterness and fatigue, and the so-called "labor is glorious!" "serving the working people!" will also be empty words. This situation also occurred during the "December 9th" Movement. At that time, many students also embraced revolutionary enthusiasm, took off their student uniforms, put on peasant clothes, and embarked on the path of combining with workers and peasants. Most of them were wholeheartedly for the revolution, considering hardship as glory, and truly integrated with workers and peasants. However, a few people could not endure hardship and were paralyzed by the cruel class struggle. Thus, they longed for the comfortable life of their families, old ideas took over, and they finally broke away from the revolutionary ranks.
    At present, socialist university students in our country should start a new life, not only learning book knowledge well, but also learning to labor, and also combining with the workers and peasants. Of course, this will be more arduous, but it is the necessary path to becoming a working-class intellectual, and it is the training and test that revolutionary students must undergo. I think it is very meaningful to quote Chairman Mao here. Chairman Mao once said in 1939: "It does not count if some young people only talk about their belief in the Three People's Principles or Marxism." He also said: "The final dividing line between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing and put into practice combining with the workers and peasants." I think Chairman Mao's words are a guiding light for young students to embark on the path of thorough revolution, and a motto for every revolutionary young student.

### 大学生要有革命者的志气

　　大学生要有革命者的志气
　　友滨
    最近，许多大学生利用课余时间积极地参加了帮助农民生产和在校内打扫教室、宿舍等体力劳动。多数人从实践中体会到劳动的光荣和艰巨，思想上收获很大，心情愉快舒畅。但是少数学生表现消极，认为是一种负担，说：“参加体力劳动以后就是感到累、苦，不能体会对思想改造有什么帮助”。
    听到这些话以后，人们不禁要问：为什么有些学生平时口口声声地说：“劳动光荣、伟大”，而当他们真的参加劳动以后又喊累叫苦呢？这和学生对累和苦的看法有很大的关系。
    参加体力劳动是累一些、苦一些，不过问题不在这里，而在于怎样理解这种累和苦。对于革命学生来讲，劳动以后感到累应该说是一种进步，因为过去学生“五谷不分，四体不勤”，“肩不能挑，手不能提”，根本不知道劳动是什么滋味，当他们参加劳动以后，感到腰酸背疼，这时只要他们认识到劳动的意义，就会渐渐地体会到劳动的艰巨，对体力劳动有了感情，和劳动人民有了共同的语言，这样他们平时就会珍惜劳动果实，节约国家财产，就会考虑到劳动人民的利益和要求。这是知识分子思想上的一个大跃进。同时，当他们感到真正为劳动人民作了点事情的时候，那会多么兴奋和愉快！那时就会从“苦”中尝到真正的“甜”。相反地，那些只会从字面上来理解苦和累的人，那些轻视劳动、轻视劳动人民，只会享受别人劳动成果的人，那些把“己所不欲皆施之于人”的人，他们在劳动中只会感到肉体上的疲劳和精神上的痛苦。他们在劳动中应该得到的——共产主义思想和品质就不可能得到，应该丢掉的——资产阶级思想也不会丢掉（而这些肮脏的思想是必须丢掉的）。自然，他们思想上是空虚的，所谓“舒适”、“幸福”对他们只是一些暂时的假象罢了。
    参加体力劳动是可以改造思想的，但并不是说只要参加体力劳动就一定可以把思想改造好，这并不像在染缸里染东西一样简单，掉进去就能染好。要在劳动中改造好思想还必须对体力劳动有正确的认识，对改造思想有迫切的愿望，要有战胜一切艰难困苦的革命者的志气。而那些只想寻求捷径，寻求适合自己舒适、安逸口味的人，就只会被苦、累所吓跑，什么“劳动光荣呀！”“为劳动人民服务呀！”也是一句空话。这种情况在“一二·九”运动时期也曾经出现过，那时不少学生也抱着革命的热情，脱下学生装，换上农民服，走上了与工农相结合的道路，其中多数人是全心全意为了革命，以艰苦为光荣，真正和工农结合在一起了。而少数人吃不得苦，被残酷的阶级斗争吓得瘫软了，于是又留恋起家庭舒适的生活，旧的思想占了上风，终于脱离开革命的队伍。
    目前，我国社会主义的大学生，应该开始新的生活，不仅要学好书本知识，还要学会劳动，还要和工农民众相结合。当然，这样作会艰苦一些，但是这却是走向工人阶级知识分子的必经之途，是革命学生必须经受的锻炼和考验。我想在这里引用毛主席的话是很有意义的，毛主席在1939年曾经说过：“有些青年，仅仅在嘴上大讲其信仰三民主义，或者信仰马克思主义，这是不算数的”。又说：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合”。我想毛主席这句话是青年学生走上彻底革命道路的指路明灯，是每一个革命青年学生的座右铭。
