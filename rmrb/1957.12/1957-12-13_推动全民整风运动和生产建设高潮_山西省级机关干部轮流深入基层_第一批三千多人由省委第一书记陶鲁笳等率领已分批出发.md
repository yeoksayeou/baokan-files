Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 11th -- The first group of work teams from Shanxi Province's provincial-level leading 机关 to go to the countryside, mountains, and factories are now heading towards Jinan, Changzhi, and Yanbei areas, led by Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Secretaries of the Secretariat, Wei Heng and Wang Qian. This group of work teams consists of more than 3,200 people. As of now, more than 1,500 people have already departed, and the rest will depart successively before the 15th. These personnel will work in rural areas and factories for forty days before returning to their original 机关. Their purpose in going down is to participate in and promote the nationwide rectification movement that is being carried out throughout the province, and to promote the industrial and agricultural production and construction movement that is being carried out throughout the province; and to receive training from it, understand the situation at the grassroots level, so that they can do a good job in the rectification movement of the provincial-level leading 机关 after they return. From now until the end of March next year, most of the cadres in Shanxi's provincial-level 机关 will go down to work for forty days in batches and in turn.

The rural areas and factories and mines of Shanxi Province are in the midst of two upsurges: the nationwide rectification movement and the industrial and agricultural production and construction movement. The rectification movement of the provincial-level leading 机关 has generally entered the third stage, focusing on rectification and improvement. In order to closely link the rectification movement and the production and construction movement of the provincial-level leading 机关 with the grassroots level, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to this batch of cadres going to the countryside, mountains, and factories in batches. The Provincial Party Committee believes that this can enable the healthy development of the two movements of rectification and production. The Provincial Party Committee requires all cadres who go down to maintain close contact with the workers and peasants, learn from the workers and peasants, and understand the ideological situation and economic living conditions of the workers and peasants; at the same time, the Provincial Party Committee requires the cadres who go down to test the leadership's production arrangements and plans for next year in the mass movement, understand the potential strength, advanced experience, and existing problems in industrial and agricultural production; and extensively and deeply understand the opinions of the masses on the leadership.

Before the first batch of people going to the countryside, mountains, and factories set off on the 9th, Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, delivered a speech at the mobilization meeting. He asked everyone not to be guests after going down, not to act as imperial envoys, but to eat, live, and labor together with the masses from an emotional and ideological standpoint, to become one with them, and to use the actual current movement as a mirror to examine their own thoughts and styles.

    山西省级机关干部轮流深入基层
    第一批三千多人由省委第一书记陶鲁笳等率领已分批出发
    新华社太原11日电　山西省省级领导机关第一批下乡、上山、下厂工作团，正由中共山西省委第一书记陶鲁笳、书记处书记卫恒、王谦等率领，分别向晋南、长治和雁北等地区进发。这批工作团共有三千二百多人。到目前为止，有一千五百多人已经出发，其他的人员将在15日前陆续出发。这些人员将在农村、工厂工作四十天后回原机关。他们下去的目的，是参加并推动正在全省开展的全民整风运动，和推动正在全省开展的工农业生产建设运动；并从中受到锻炼，了解下情，以便回来后，搞好省级领导机关的整风运动。从目前到明年3月底，山西省级机关大部分干部都将分批轮流下去工作四十天。
    山西省农村和厂矿正处在全民整风运动和工农业生产建设运动的两个高潮当中。省级各领导机关的整风运动，已经普遍转入着重整改的第三个阶段。为了使省级领导机关和基层的整风运动、生产建设运动密切联系起来，中共山西省委十分重视这次干部的分批下乡、上山、下厂工作。省委认为这样可使整风和生产两个运动健康的发展。省委要求所有下去的干部要密切联系工农群众，向工农群众学习，了解工农群众的思想情况和经济生活状况；同时要求下去的干部在群众运动中检验领导部门明年的生产部署和计划，了解工农业生产中的潜在力量、先进经验和存在的问题；并且广泛深入了解群众对领导部门的意见。
    第一批下乡、上山、下厂人员在9日出发前，省委第一书记陶鲁笳在动员大会上讲了话。他要求大家下去后不要作客，不要当钦差大臣，要从感情上、思想上和群众同吃同住同劳动，打成一片，并且要把当前运动实际当作镜子来对照检查自己的思想和作风。
