    How to Get Out of a Dead End
    William Henderson, director of the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations, believes that the embargo policy implemented by the United States is ineffective, and can only show the United States' "irreconcilable hatred" towards New China, and cannot prevent the consolidation of New China. He advocates that "we must find a way to get out of the dead end to which our China policy has led us."
    However, Henderson also said: "It would be foolish for the United States to suddenly abandon its position," and that if the United States yielded without getting "compensatory benefits," it would cause a "major blow" to the "prestige" of the United States in Asia.
    This is really wishful thinking. The result of the United States' hostility towards China has put itself in a dead end, but now it wants China to give the United States "compensation" so that the United States can get out of the dead end. Mr. Henderson, you've miscalculated.

    怎样走出死路
    美国外交学会会议主任威廉·汉德逊，认为美国执行的禁运政策是无效的，只能表明美国对新中国的“不共戴天的仇视”，而不能阻止新中国的巩固。他主张“必须想办法从对华政策把我们引到的死路中走出来”。
    但是，汉德逊又说：“美国如果忽然放弃它的立场将是愚蠢的”，美国得不到“补偿性的好处就让了步的话”，将使美国在亚洲的“威望”，受到“重大的打击”。
    这真是异想天开。美国敌视中国的结果，使自己钻进了死路，现在却想叫中国给美国“补偿”，让美国从死路中走出来。汉德逊先生，你未免打错算盘了。
