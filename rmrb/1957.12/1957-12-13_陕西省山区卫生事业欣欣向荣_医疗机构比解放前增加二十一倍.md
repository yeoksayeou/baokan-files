Shaanxi Province's Mountainous Regions See Flourishing Healthcare
    Medical Institutions Increased Twenty-One Times Compared to Pre-Liberation

    (Our Dispatch) Healthcare in the mountainous regions of Shaanxi Province has seen great development.

    Shaanxi, besides the well-known and fertile Hanzhong Basin and Guanzhong Plain, is more than three-quarters mountainous. There are sixty-three counties that are entirely or mostly mountainous, with more than 7.9 million hardworking and brave people. Now, every county in the mountainous region has a health center, and most districts have district health stations. Counties like Xunyi and Linyou have achieved the goal of having a township health station or joint clinic in every township. The total number of health institutions in the mountainous regions is 856, twenty-one times more than before Liberation, with 1,725 beds and more than 5,700 medical personnel. In northern Shaanxi, there were only thirty-three medical personnel before Liberation; by the end of 1956, this number had grown to 1,699.

    In recent years, health departments at all levels in the mountainous regions have led the masses in carrying out various health initiatives, engaging in a arduous struggle against disease. About 80% of health and medical institutions have implemented a mobile medical system, regularly going deep into the high mountains and remote valleys to treat the masses and promote health knowledge. During the busy farming seasons, health workers deliver medicine to the fields and threshing grounds, wherever people are working, fully supporting production. To better serve the masses, many health institutions have adopted the practice of "providing consultations on market days and going to the countryside after the market," and have established various working systems suitable for the production and living habits of the masses. Most villages and agricultural cooperatives have established epidemic reporting networks and physician responsibility areas, so that outbreaks can be promptly controlled and treated. Since the launch of the patriotic health campaign to change customs and habits, many mountainous areas have presented a clean and refreshing appearance, and the living habits and housing conditions of the masses have gradually improved. The number of people who understand the importance of hygiene and cleanliness is no longer just a few individuals. After Liberation, acute infectious diseases such as plague, smallpox, and cholera have been brought under control; typhus and relapsing fever have also been basically eliminated; the incidence of common diseases such as measles and scarlet fever has been decreasing every year. In Yulin County, after vigorous prevention and treatment, the number of measles cases in the first half of 1957 was even less than the number of cases in one month during the same period in 1956. The Party and the government have also vigorously carried out prevention and treatment of endemic diseases and chronic infectious diseases that seriously endanger the health of the people. In the Huanglong Mountain area, the number of people suffering from "yellow water disease" reached more than 2,000 in 1948; this year, very few patients have been found. More than a dozen counties have used iodized salt to prevent and treat goiter. Prevention and treatment of Kashin-Beck disease is also being promoted as a key task. The province has also established three leprosy hospitals (villages), accommodating all scattered patients. Seventy-nine people have now recovered and been discharged from the hospital, basically controlling the spread of leprosy within the province.

    Currently, the counties in the mountainous regions are conducting comprehensive surveys of endemic diseases, consolidating and strengthening medical institutions at all levels, and carrying out winter patriotic health campaigns. Combining rectification with inspections, they are formulating work plans for next year, making the prevention and treatment of endemic diseases an important task for next year. The health administrative leading departments of Shaanxi Province are studying ways to strengthen healthcare in the mountainous regions, such as increasing the number of health cadres and medical equipment. The preliminary plan for 1958 is to increase the number of beds in the mountainous regions by 200, district health stations by 15, health and epidemic prevention stations by 3, maternal and child health centers by 3, establish 20 mobile medical teams, repair some mountain health centers and stations, add medical equipment, and expand the establishment of simple rural hospital beds.

　　陕西省山区卫生事业欣欣向荣
    医疗机构比解放前增加二十一倍
    本报讯　陕西省山区卫生事业有了很大的发展。
    陕西除了以富饶著称的汉中盆地和关中平原之外，山区占总土地面积的四分之三以上，全部和大部是山区的县共六十三个，有七百九十多万勤劳勇敢的人民。现在山区各县都有了卫生院，大部分区有了区卫生所，?阳、麟游等县，已达到乡乡有乡卫生所或联合诊所。山区卫生机构总数共八百五十六个，比解放前增加了二十一倍，病床一千七百二十五张，医务人员五千七百多名。陕北解放前只有三十三个医务人员，1956年底已发展到一千六百九十九人。
    几年来，山区各级卫生部门，领导群众开展各项卫生工作，同疾病作艰苦的斗争。大约有80％的卫生医疗机构都实行了巡回医疗制，经常深入高山深壑给群众治病，宣传卫生知识。每当农忙季节，卫生人员把医药送到地头、场畔，送到一切有人生产的地方，全力配合生产。很多卫生机构为了便利群众，都采取“逢集诊疗、背集下乡”，和建立了各种适合群众生产、生活习惯的工作制度。现在大部分村子和农业社都建立了疫情报告网和医师责任区，一旦发生疫情就能及时扑灭和治疗。移风易俗的爱国卫生运动开展以后，不少山区呈现一片整洁清新的景象，群众的生活习惯、居住条件也逐渐得到改善，懂得讲卫生爱清洁的人已不是个别的了。解放后，烈性传染病如鼠疫、天花、霍乱都先后得到控制；斑疹伤寒、回归热也基本消灭；过去常见的麻疹、猩红热发病率每年都在降低。榆林县的麻疹，经过大力防治以后，1957年上半年发病人数，比1956年同一时期内一个月的发病人数还少。党和政府对危害人民健康最严重的地方病和慢性传染病也大力进行了防治。黄龙山区的吐黄水病，1948年患病人数达二千多人，今年发现的病人已很少了。已有十几个县施用碘盐防治甲状腺肿。大骨节病的防治工作也正在重点推行。全省还建立了三个麻疯病院（村），收治了全部散在的病人，现在有七十九人痊愈出院，基本上控制了麻疯病在省境内的传染。
    目前山区各县正全面调查地方病，整顿和加强各级医疗机构，开展冬季爱国卫生运动；结合整风检查工作，制订明年的工作计划，将防治地方病作为明年的一项重要任务。陕西省卫生行政领导部门，为了进一步加强山区卫生工作，正研究充实山区的卫生干部、医疗设备等工作。1958年初步计划在山区发展病床二百张，区卫生所十五个，卫生防疫站三个，妇幼卫生所三个，建立巡回医疗队二十个，修缮一些山区卫生院、所，增添医疗器械，扩大建立乡村简易病床。
