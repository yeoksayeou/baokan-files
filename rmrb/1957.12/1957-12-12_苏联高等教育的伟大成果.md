　　Great Achievements of Soviet Higher Education
    Ye Liujin, Minister of Higher Education of the Soviet Union
    In his report at the celebration meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, when discussing the tasks and prospects of communist construction, pointed out that one of the factors that make the Soviet people believe that the communist construction plan can be successfully completed is that we have excellent cadres in all aspects of economic and cultural construction. The report stated: We now possess highly skilled cadres who are able to improve technology, continuously increase social labor productivity, continuously improve economic indicators in industry, construction, transportation, and agriculture, and successfully solve the most complex tasks in developing the national economy.
    To train a large number of proficient experts for all sectors of our construction is one of the great achievements of socialism.
    We are very pleased to see that the enormous achievements our country has made in higher education are commensurate with our socialist era, and they clearly demonstrate the superiority of socialism over capitalism.
    In pre-revolutionary Russia, there were only one hundred and five institutions of higher learning, with a student population of one hundred and twenty-seven thousand. Now, in the Soviet Union, there are seven hundred and sixty-seven institutions of higher learning (including correspondence and evening schools), with over two million students.
    Before the revolution, higher education was a privilege of the propertied classes. It was very difficult for the children of working people to enter institutions of higher learning. As for the working people in the minority regions of old Russia, higher education was simply unattainable. In the current territories of the Byelorussian, Lithuanian, Moldavian, Azerbaijani, Armenian, Kazakh, Uzbek, Turkmen, Tajik, and Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republics, there was not even a single institution of higher learning at that time. Now, these republics have one hundred and fifty-two institutions of higher learning, with approximately three hundred and twenty thousand students.
    In recent years, the distribution of institutions of higher learning has also undergone great changes. The state's concern for developing the productive forces of our country's eastern regions has determined the rapid development of existing institutions of higher learning and the establishment of new institutions of higher learning in these areas. In the Urals, western and eastern Siberia, the Far East, and the Central Asian republics, the network of institutions of higher learning is expanding. There are now two hundred institutions of higher learning in this area, compared to only four before the revolution. The number of students in 1957 increased by 60% compared to 1950, and by 2.2 times compared to 1940.
    The enormous scale of the development of higher education in the Soviet Union enables us to train a strong contingent of young Soviet intellectuals who are extremely loyal to the people in a relatively short historical period. In 1956, institutions of higher learning trained nearly two hundred and sixty thousand young experts. During the entire Soviet era, a total of three million eight hundred thousand specialized personnel have been trained, of which approximately one million are engineers.
    There are now more than six million specialized personnel with higher or secondary professional education in the Soviet national economy, which is thirty-two times more than in pre-revolutionary Russia.
    No capitalist country has ever had such a large-scale training of specialized personnel. At the same time, the extremely high speed of cadre training has determined the successful resolution of complex scientific and technological problems. This has caused concern in capitalist countries.
    Professor Thompson of Glasgow Technical College in Britain, when talking about the achievements of the Soviet Union in science and technology, concluded that this is "the result of the Soviet Union devoting most of its funds to education, especially higher technical education." He emphasized that the Soviet Union trains nine times more engineers than Britain, and almost twice as many per million people.
    U.S. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Folsom, when criticizing the current situation of American general education and the training of higher professional cadres, said that college students in Russian universities and specialized schools spend twice as many hours in class each year as American college students.
    Foreign observers call the artificial earth satellite the result of our education system and the victory of the Soviet system of training scientific and engineering cadres. In the foreign bourgeois press, especially in the American press, comparative analyses of the situations of secondary and higher education in the Soviet Union and the United States are now frequently made, and the task of catching up with the Soviet Union in this regard is proposed.
    Institutions of higher learning actively participate in scientific research and make significant contributions to the progress of science and technology in our country. In all the most important scientific fields, institutions of higher learning are studying many urgent problems with significant theoretical and practical significance.
    Mastering the peaceful use of atomic energy, manufacturing intercontinental ballistic missiles and the equipment for launching them are the greatest achievements of Soviet science and technology. The manufacturing and launching of the world's first two artificial earth satellites are outstanding victories of Soviet science and technology. Scholars in institutions of higher learning have made huge contributions to these greatest achievements of our time.
    The most important task of institutions of higher learning is to replenish the ranks of Soviet intellectuals with young intellectuals who have fully mastered specialized skills at a high level, are educated in the spirit of the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism, have broad social and political perspectives, are infinitely loyal to the cause of their motherland and the Communist Party, and are able to work tirelessly to consolidate the power of the socialist state.
    In recent years, the Party Central Committee has pointed out extremely important shortcomings in the planning of cadre training by specialty and by economic region, pointing out that the specialization of professional cadre training is too detailed. Much work has now been done to correct these shortcomings. The cadres now trained by institutions of higher learning are able to meet the requirements of the further development of science and technology.
    The distribution of institutions of higher learning is continuing to be vigorously improved in accordance with the national economic regions. In the past four years, forty new institutions of higher learning have been established in various economic regions. In the past three years, the number of admissions to institutions of higher learning in central cities has been greatly reduced, while the number of admissions to institutions of higher learning in our country's eastern regions has been expanded.
    Under the conditions of the rapid progress of science and technology and the achievements of general education, the problem of admissions to institutions of higher learning has become more urgent. Now, those who apply to institutions of higher learning must be required to have much more comprehensive preparation, that is, not only school knowledge of general education, but also production experience.
    Many young people who have graduated from middle school are now working in production and have acquired production skills. Such young people should become the basic source of our replenishment of personnel in institutions of higher learning. In 1957, we have already seen the important results of this direction. A large part of the first-year students in many institutions of higher learning are young people from the production front.
    The 20th Congress of the CPSU required institutions of higher learning to improve the quality of training young experts as much as possible, to bring the teaching process as close as possible to practice, and to greatly improve the scientific research work of institutions of higher learning.
    One of the most important tasks of institutions of higher learning is to improve the effectiveness of university students' production internships. Because, up to now, it still cannot guarantee that young experts receive the practical training they deserve. Under current conditions, it is entirely appropriate to propose that university students' production internships be carried out in the following way: that is, to let university students work directly on construction sites from the first year, gradually starting to learn how to independently complete the production tasks of intermediate workers, then the tasks of senior workers or junior technicians, and finally be able to independently lead certain sections. University students should also study a wide range of production issues, not only technical ones, but also including the organization and economics of production.
    As everyone knows, the work performance of any school, especially the performance of institutions of higher learning, depends entirely on the staffing of teachers. In recent years, the speed of development of our institutions of higher learning has been faster than the training of professors and teachers, especially faster than the training of cadres with high professional levels (doctors of science and professors). And now our institutions of higher learning, although they possess a strong scientific force, still lack this type of worker - doctors and professors. Hence, one of the most important tasks of institutions of higher learning is to conduct meticulous and systematic work in the next few years to improve the professional level of teachers in institutions of higher learning, thereby training the insufficient number of doctors and professors. This task can be accomplished under the conditions of fully unfolding the scientific research work of various teaching and research offices and laboratories in institutions of higher learning, and widely attracting all teachers and the best senior students to participate in scientific work.
    The recently implemented reform of the leadership form of the national economy and the establishment of economic zones undoubtedly promote the completion of these requirements. Strengthening the connection between institutions of higher learning and production, with the participation of the National Economic Commission, will be implemented much more smoothly, because the National Economic Commission can more fully consider the requirements of its own enterprises and also consider the working conditions of institutions of higher learning.
    In the process of institutions of higher learning increasingly approaching production, in addition to widely expanding correspondence and night universities, it is necessary to further improve the teaching of institutions of higher learning, so that it is increasingly directly combined with productive labor in production.
    The magnificent prospects for the economic and cultural development of the Soviet Union entrust us with better planning for the training of proficient cadres, in order to fully meet the needs of various sectors of the national economy and culture for experts. We must especially greatly strengthen the training of experts in physics, computer technology, electronics, semiconductor science, automation, long-distance mechanics, and many other new aspects of science and technology.

　　苏联高等教育的伟大成果
    苏联高等教育部部长　叶留金
    苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃庆祝会上的报告中谈到共产主义建设的任务与前景时指出，苏联人相信共产主义建设计划能顺利完成的因素之一，就是我们在经济和文化建设各方面有优秀的干部。报告中说：我们现在拥有业务水平很高的干部，他们能够改进技术、不断提高社会劳动生产率，不断提高工业、建筑业、运输业和农业中的经济指标，来成功地解决发展国民经济的最复杂的任务。
    为我们建设的各部门培养出为数众多的、精通业务的专家，是社会主义的伟大成果之一。
    我们非常欣慰地看到，我国在高等教育方面所达到的巨大成就是与我们的社会主义时代相称的，它们明显地表示出社会主义比资本主义的优越性。
    在革命前的俄国只有一百零五所高等学校，学生的数目是十二万七千人。现在在苏联有七百六十七所高等学校（函授与夜校在内），学生有二百多万人。
    革命前，高等教育是有产阶级的一种特权。劳动人民子弟进入高等学校是很困难的。至于旧俄的少数民族地区的劳动人民，高等教育对他们则根本是望尘莫及的。在目前的白俄罗斯、立陶宛、摩尔达维亚、阿塞拜疆、亚美尼亚、哈萨克、乌兹别克、土库曼、塔吉克、吉尔吉斯各加盟共和国的领土上，那时连一所高等学校也没有。现在，在这些加盟共和国中有一百五十二所高等学校，学生有三十二万人左右。
    近年来高等学校的分布情况也起了很大变化。国家对发展我国东部生产力的关怀，决定了这些区域内现有的高等学校的迅速发展和新的高等学校的建立。在乌拉尔、西部和东部西伯利亚、远东和中亚各共和国，高等学校网正在扩大。现在这一带有二百所高等学校，革命前则仅有四所。学生人数1957年比1950年增加了60％，比1940年增加了二点二倍。
    苏联高等教育发展的庞大规模，使我们能在较短的历史时期中培养出一支对人民极其忠诚的、年青的苏联知识分子的强大队伍。在1956年，高等学校培养出了将近二十六万青年专家，在整个苏维埃政权年代里，共培养出三百八十万专门人材，其中约一百万是工程师。
    在苏联国民经济中现在有六百万以上受过高等或中等专业教育的专门人材，这比革命前的俄国多三十二倍。
    任何一个资本主义国家在培养专门人材方面，从来也没有这样庞大的规模。同时，培养干部的极高速度就决定了复杂的科学技术问题的顺利解决。这引起了资本主义国家的忧虑。
    英国格拉斯哥工学院汤普森教授谈到苏联在科学技术方面的成就时，得出结论说：这是“苏联把大部分资金用于教育、特别是高等技术教育的结果。”他着重指出，苏联培养的工程师要比英国多九倍，如按每百万人中的数目计，则几乎多两倍。
    美国卫生、教育和福利部长弗尔逊在批评美国普通教育和培养高等专业干部的现状时说，俄国大学和专门学校里的大学生，每年的上课时数比美国的大学生多一倍。
    外国观察家把人造地球卫星称作是我们教育制度的结果，是苏联培养科学和工程师干部制度的胜利。在外国资产阶级报刊上，特别是在美国报刊上，现在经常对苏联和美国的中等和高等教育情况作比较分析，并提出在这方面赶上苏联的任务。
    高等学校是积极参加科学研究工作的，它对我国科学技术的进步有重大的贡献。在一切最重要的科学部门，高等学校都研究着许许多多有重大理论及实际意义的迫切问题。
    掌握了和平利用原子能，制造了洲际弹道火箭及使其发射的设备，是苏联科学和技术的最大成就。制造并发射了世界上头两颗人造地球卫星，是苏联科学技术的卓越胜利。高等学校的学者对当代这些最伟大的成就有巨大贡献。
    高等学校的最重要任务是，要用完全掌握了高等水平的专门业务、以马克思列宁主义伟大思想的精神教育出来的、具有广大社会政治眼光、对自己祖国和共产党的事业无限忠诚的、能够不倦地为巩固社会主义国家威力的青年知识分子，来补充苏维埃知识界的干部。
    近年来党中央委员会指出了在按专业和按经济地区培养干部规划中的极重要的缺点，指出培养专业干部时业务分得过细。现在为改正这些缺点已经做了许多工作。高等学校现在培养的干部是能够满足科学技术进一步发展的要求的。
    高等学校的分布情况，正在按照全国经济地区继续大力改进。最近四年来在各个经济地区新创办了四十所高等学校。近三年来，中央各城市高等学校的招生数目大为缩减，同时扩大了我国东部各高等学校的招生数目。
    在科学技术的飞跃进步和普通教育的成就的条件下，高等学校的招生问题就变得更加迫切。现在对投考高等学校的人必须要求有更全面得多的准备，即不仅要有普通教育的学校知识，而且要有生产经验。
    现在有许多中学毕业的青年在生产中工作，并已获得了生产技能。这样的青年应当成为我们高等学校人员补充的基本来源。1957年我们已经看到这个方向的重要成果。许多高等学校的一年级学生大部分是来自生产战线上的青年。
    苏共第二十次代表大会要求高等学校尽量提高培养青年专家的质量，尽量使教学过程同实际接近，大大改进高等学校的科学研究工作。
    高等学校最重要的任务之一就是要提高大学生生产实习的效果。因为到目前为止，它还不能保证青年专家得到应有的实际锻炼。在目前条件下，提出按下列办法来进行大学生的生产实习问题是完全适时的：即让大学生从一年级起就直接在工地上劳动，逐步地开始学会独立完成中级工人的生产任务，然后是高级工人或初级技术人员的任务，最后能独立领导一定的工段。大学生同时应当研究广泛的生产问题，不只是技术性的，并且也包括生产的组织和经济。
    众所周知，任何学校的工作成绩，尤其是高等学校的成绩，完全要依靠教师干部的配备。近年来我们高等学校发展的速度比教授教师干部的培养快，特别是比具有高等业务水平的干部（科学博士和教授）的培养快。而现在我们的高等学校，虽然拥有雄厚的科学力量，但仍然缺乏这一类的工作者——博士和教授。由此也就产生了高等学校的最重要任务之一：即在最近几年内要进行细致而系统的工作，以提高高等学校教师的业务水平，从而培养出博士和教授的不足之数。在全面展开高等学校各教研室和试验室的科学研究工作、广泛吸引全体教师和高年级最好的学生参加科学工作的条件下，这项任务是能够完成的。
    不久前实行的改组国民经济的领导形式和建立经济区，无疑地促进了这些要求的完成。加强高等学校同生产的联系，在国民经济委员会的参加下会实行得更加顺利得多，因为国民经济委员会既能够更充分地考虑到自己企业的要求，也能考虑到高等学校工作的条件。
    在高等学校日益接近生产的过程中，除去要广泛扩大函授和夜大学以外，需要进一步改进高等学校的教学，使它同生产劳动日益直接地在生产中结合起来。
    苏联经济和文化发展的壮丽前景，责成我们更好地筹划对精通业务干部的培养，以便充分满足国民经济和文化各部门对专家的需求。我们特别要大大加强培养物理学、计算机技术、电子学、半导体学、自动化、远距离机械学和其他许多科学技术新的方面的专家。
