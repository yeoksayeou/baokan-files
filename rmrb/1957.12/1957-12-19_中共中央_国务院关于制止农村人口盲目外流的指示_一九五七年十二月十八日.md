The blind influx of a large number of rural people into cities occurred last winter and this spring. Although various localities have separately dissuaded and repatriated them, it has not been fundamentally stopped. Since the beginning of autumn this year, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hebei and other provinces have experienced the phenomenon of blind outflow of rural population again. The guiding principle of our country's socialist construction is to develop industry and agriculture simultaneously on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. Agriculture occupies a very important position in our country's socialist construction. The large-scale outflow of rural population not only reduces the rural labor force, hinders the development of agricultural production and the consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives, but also increases the number of unemployed people in cities, which also brings many difficulties to various aspects of urban work. At present, the Party and the government are mobilizing a large number of cadres and middle school graduates in cities to go to the countryside and mountainous areas to engage in agricultural production. Of course, it is even more unacceptable to allow the blind inflow of rural population into cities. In order to prevent the blind outflow of rural population from continuing, the following instructions are now issued:

1.  In rural areas, ideological education for the masses should be strengthened. It should be explained that the development of agriculture is of great significance and that agricultural production has broad prospects; it should be explained that cities and industrial and mining areas no longer recruit personnel casually, and in the future, recruitment in rural areas should be planned and allocated through agricultural production cooperatives; it should be explained that blind outflow is harmful to oneself, to agricultural production, and to national construction. In the socialist education currently being carried out in rural areas, debates should be launched on this matter to raise the ideological awareness of farmers. At the same time, agricultural production and mountain development should be earnestly organized, and a large-scale movement of agricultural production and agricultural capital construction should be launched to increase the enthusiasm of farmers for production. In disaster areas, in particular, disaster relief work should be done well, and overall plans should be implemented, arrangements should be made household by household, and disaster victims should be organized to engage in production for self-rescue on the spot. Township people's committees and agricultural production cooperatives should earnestly dissuade rural people who attempt to leave, and should not issue certificates casually, allowing the blind outflow of rural population; those who do not engage in production, loaf around, like to run around, and induce others to go out should be severely criticized, and if they repeatedly refuse to mend their ways after education, they should be handed over to the agricultural production cooperative to supervise their labor.

2.  Along certain railway lines or transportation arteries, efforts to dissuade the blind outflow of rural population should be strengthened. In view of the fact that the blind outflow of rural population is most prevalent in the five provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Hebei, these areas should especially strengthen dissuasion and education work on this issue. Along the Beijing-Hankou, Tianjin-Pukou, Longhai, and Beijing-Shenyang railways, dissuasion agencies mainly composed of civil affairs departments and participated by public security, railway and other departments should be established at appropriate locations or stations. Dissuasion agencies can also be established at transportation hubs bordering provinces and other railway and highway stations, waterway terminals and ports where the rural population flows a lot. Along the way, persuasion and repatriation work should be carried out, and care must be taken to prevent farmers from moving too far or concentrating in cities, which would increase the difficulty of repatriation. Railway and transportation departments should strengthen the ticket inspection system at stations, ports, and on vehicles and ships, and strictly prohibit the phenomenon of riding trains and ships without tickets or buying short-distance tickets to ride long-distance trains and ships. Rural outflow populations riding trains and ships without tickets or owing tickets should be taken in and handed over to the nearest dissuasion agency, and after persuasion, they should be quickly sent back to their place of origin.

3.  In cities and industrial and mining areas, the rural population that has blindly flowed in must be mobilized to return to their place of origin, and begging and vagrancy must be strictly prohibited. Public security organs shall conduct strict household registration management in accordance with the urban household registration management regulations. In large cities with a large influx of rural population, civil affairs departments should set up shelters for temporary accommodation and send them back to their place of origin in a concentrated manner. During the accommodation, they can be organized to engage in labor production to earn their own travel expenses home. Those bad elements who swindle and deceive, undermine the rule of law, and disrupt public order shall be punished according to the circumstances, and those with serious circumstances shall be subject to re-education through labor or subject to criminal punishment according to law. The control of urban food supply should be strengthened, and acts of obtaining grain or buying and selling grain coupons without household registration or falsely reporting the population to fraudulently obtain grain should be prohibited, and serious circumstances should be punished. Leadership over the free market should be strengthened, and its scope should be strictly controlled. Unlicensed vendors and unlicensed vehicle transportation should be banned to prevent farmers from abandoning agriculture and engaging in commerce and speculation in cities.

4.  All enterprises, institutions, and agencies, troops, groups, schools, and other employing units shall not recruit workers or temporary workers without authorization. Any increase in workers or temporary workers required by each unit must be uniformly allocated or recruited through the local labor department. Temporary workers (including porters, babysitters, etc.) should be recruited in cities as a priority. If it is necessary to recruit in rural areas, the method of signing labor contracts with agricultural production cooperatives in nearby rural areas should be adopted. After the contract expires, the employing unit should directly send them back to their place of origin. Local labor departments and supervision departments should inspect and supervise the employment of personnel by employing units, and should strictly stop the phenomenon of unauthorized employment of personnel. Those who fail to comply with the prohibition should be punished.

5.  Those who have flowed into the local countryside from other places and have not yet been resettled should also be mobilized to return to their place of origin. However, for those who have flowed into some areas with more land, fewer people, and insufficient labor, if they are willing to settle there for a long time and engage in agricultural production, and have obtained or reissued certificates from the agricultural production cooperative where they originally belonged, they can be resettled by inserting them into the commune. For some farmers who voluntarily move to rural areas in other places to participate in agricultural production and settle down for a long time due to family and friends, if they hold a certificate from the original cooperative and have obtained permission from the newly joined cooperative, they can also be resettled locally.

6.  The repatriation of the rural outflow population should be carried out in the form of "one-time repatriation to home," and should not be transferred midway to avoid waste and prevent it from flowing back to the city midway. When repatriating a large number of rural outflow populations over long distances, the outflow area should send people to receive them, or the inflow area should send people to repatriate them.

7.  In carrying out this work, the relevant departments must cooperate closely. The five provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Hebei, as well as provinces and cities with a large influx of rural population, should form a specialized agency mainly composed of civil affairs departments and participated by public security, railway, labor, transportation, commerce, grain, supervision and other departments to be responsible for handling the large flows of rural population. The Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation should assist in mobilizing young people and women who have blindly flowed into cities to return to their hometowns. The trade union should educate employees to mobilize relatives who have blindly flowed into cities to return to their hometowns; and persuade employees to support and encourage relatives to engage in agricultural production with a correct attitude, and not to exaggerate urban life and attract rural people to go out.

It is hoped that the above instructions will be studied and implemented by the party committees at all levels and the local people's committees at all levels. Provinces, municipalities directly under the Central Government, prefectures, counties, and cities with large outflows and inflows of rural population should formulate specific measures for dissuasion and repatriation. Counties with large outflows of rural population should forward this instruction to the townships and organize cadres to discuss and implement it. The relevant departments of the Central Committee should issue instructions within their own business scope, instructing their affiliated units to implement them.

　　关于制止农村人口盲目外流的指示
    一九五七年十二月十八日
    去冬今春曾有大量农村人口盲目流入城市，虽经各地分别劝阻和遣送返乡，但是还没有能够根本制止。今年入秋以来，山东、江苏、安徽、河南、河北等省又发生了农村人口盲目外流的现象。我国社会主义建设的方针，是在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业和发展农业同时并举。农业在我国社会主义的建设中占有很重要的地位。农村人口大量外流，不仅使农村劳动力减少，妨碍农业生产的发展和农业生产合作社的巩固，而且会使城市增加一些无业可就的人口，也给城市的各方面工作带来了不少困难。目前党和政府正在动员城市中大批干部和中小学毕业生下乡上山，投入农业生产，当然更不能允许农村人口盲目流入城市。为了制止农村人口盲目外流的情况继续发生，现在作如下指示：
    一、在农村中，应当加强对群众的思想教育。说明发展农业的重要意义和农业生产有很广阔的前途；说明目前城市和工矿区都不再随便招用人员，今后在农村招用人员要通过农业生产合作社有计划地调配；说明盲目外流对本人、对农业生产、对国家建设都是有害的。在目前农村正在进行的社会主义教育中，应当就此展开辩论，提高农民的思想觉悟。同时应当认真地组织农业生产和山区开发，开展大规模的农业生产和农业基本建设的运动，提高农民的生产积极性。在灾区尤其应当做好救灾工作，实行全面规划，逐户安排，把灾民组织起来，就地生产自救。乡人民委员会和农业生产合作社对企图外流的农村人口应当切实加以劝阻，不得随便开发证明信件，放任农村人口盲目外流；对于那些不事生产、游手好闲、喜欢外跑并且引诱别人外出的人，应当严加批评，如果屡教不改，应当交农业生产合作社监督他们劳动。
    二、在某些铁路沿线或者交通要道，应当加强对于农村人口盲目外流的劝阻工作。鉴于农村人口盲目外流以山东、江苏、安徽、河南、河北五省为多，这些地区应当特别加强劝阻和有关这个问题的教育工作。在京汉、津浦、陇海、京沈等铁路沿线，应当选择适当地点或者车站设立以民政部门为主有公安、铁道等部门参加的劝阻机构，各省交界的交通要隘及其他农村人口流动甚多的铁路和公路车站，水运码头和港口，也可以设立劝阻机构，沿途进行劝说和遣送返乡的工作，务须注意不使农民流动太远或者集中城市，增加遣送返乡的困难。铁道交通部门，应当在车站、港口和车船中，加强查票制度，严禁无票乘车乘船或者买短途票强乘长途车船的现象；对无票或者欠票乘车乘船的农村外流人口，应当收容起来交就近的劝阻机构，经过劝说，迅速送回原籍。
    三、在城市和工矿区，对盲目流入的农村人口，必须动员他们返回原籍，并且严禁流浪乞讨。公安机关应当依照城市管理户口规则，进行严格户口管理。在农村人口流入较多的大城市，应当由民政部门设置收容所，临时收容，集中送回原籍；收容中可组织他们劳动生产，自挣回家路费。对于招摇撞骗、破坏法治、扰乱治安的坏分子，应当依照情节给予处罚，情节严重的予以劳动教养或者依法予以刑事处分。应当加强城市粮食供应的控制，对没有户口或者虚报人口冒领粮食或者买卖粮票的行为，应当予以禁止，情节严重的应当加以处罚。对自由市场应当加强领导，严格控制其范围。应当取缔无照商贩营业和无照车辆运输，防止农民弃农经商，进城从事商业投机活动。
    四、各企业、事业部门和机关、部队、团体、学校等一切用人单位，一律不得擅自招用工人或者临时工。各单位需要增加的工人或者临时工，必须通过当地劳动部门统一调配或者招收。临时工（包括搬运工、保姆等）应当尽先在城市中招收，如果必须在农村中招收，应当采用同就近农村的农业生产合作社签订劳动合同的办法招收，合同期满后，由用人单位直接送返原籍。各地劳动部门和监察部门应当对用人单位招用人员的情况进行检查监督，对擅自招用人员的现象，应当严加制止，不听制止的应当给予处分。
    五、对于由外地流入本地农村的人，尚未安置的，也应当动员他们返回原籍。但是，对于流入某些地多、人少、劳动力不足的地区的人，如果本人愿意在那里长期安家从事农业生产，并经他原来所在的农业生产合作社开发或者补发证明信件，可以采取插社安置的办法给予安置。对于某些农民因有亲朋关系，自愿移到别地农村参加农业生产长期安家的，如果持有原地合作社的证明信件，而又得新参加的合作社的许可，亦可以就地安置。
    六、遣返农村外流人口，应当实行“一次遣返到家”的办法，不要中途转送，以免造成浪费，并且防止中途流回城市。长途遣返大批农村外流人口的时候，流出地区应当派人接领或者由流入地区派人遣送。
    七、这一工作的进行，各有关部门必须密切配合。山东、江苏、安徽、河南、河北五省以及农村人口流入较多的省、市，在农村人口流动较多的时期，应当组成以民政部门为主有公安、铁道、劳动、交通、商业、粮食、监察等部门参加的专门机构，负责处理。共青团和妇联应当分别协助动员盲目流入城市的青年、妇女返乡。工会应当教育职工动员盲目流入城市的亲属返乡；并且劝说职工以正确态服支持和鼓励亲属安心农业生产，不要对城市生活作夸大的宣传，吸引农村人口外出。
    以上指示，希望各级党委、地方各级人民委员会研究执行。农村人口流出、流入较多的省、直辖市、专、县、市，应当订出劝阻遣送的具体办法。农村人口流出较多的县，应当将这一指示转发到乡，并且组织干部讨论贯彻执行。中央各有关部门，应当就自己的业务范围发出指示，责成所属单位执行。
