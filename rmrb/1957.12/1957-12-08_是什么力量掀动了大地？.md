　　What Force Shakes the Earth?
　　Qi Wenlin
    Many people believe that nothing in the world is more stable and quieter than the earth. However, this is an illusion. The People's Daily on the 6th published news of earthquakes in the western part of the Mongolian People's Republic and the northwestern part of our country. This fact tells us that the earth is not stable; it is trembling and roaring. When it gets angry, it can even cause the earth to split and mountains to collapse.
    In 1923, Tokyo, Japan, experienced an earthquake that damaged 500,000 buildings and killed more than 100,000 people. And that only happened in a matter of seconds!
    Where does this tremendous force that shakes the earth come from?
    Some say it is the will of God.
    We are all familiar with the myth of "Nuwa patching up the sky." It mentions that when Nuwa was refining stones to mend the sky, she captured four giant Ao turtles to carry the earth. When they became impatient with carrying it, they would turn over and stretch, and then the earth would shake.
    In foreign countries, there are similar legends. However, the Ao turtles are replaced by things like whales, elephants, or golden tortoises.
    Myth is, after all, not science. The cause of earthquakes must be answered by scientists. Modern science has confirmed that this force that shakes the earth is the result of dynamic activity inside the earth.
    The collapse of huge limestone caves underground can cause the earth to sink and mountains to collapse. This is a "collapse earthquake." Although these earthquakes occur quite often, they do not affect a wide area.
    Earthquakes can sometimes occur during volcanic eruptions. This is called a volcanic earthquake. When volcanoes are active, magma impacts the earth's crust and erupts outward. At this time, explosions often occur deep in the stratum, causing the earth to shake. Volcanic earthquakes can sometimes affect dozens of kilometers, but the affected area is limited to the vicinity of the volcano, and the frequency is not high.
    The kind of earthquake that can be strong and have a wide impact is a tectonic earthquake. This is mainly caused by the internal forces of the earth, which cause the strata to fracture. Most of the earthquakes that occur normally are of this type.
    Earthquakes mostly occur in areas where the earth's crust is relatively weak. The coasts of the Pacific Ocean and the area from the European Alps to the Asian Himalayas are areas in the world prone to earthquakes. Japan is the country most seriously threatened by earthquakes. On that small piece of land, there are an average of four earthquakes a day.
    Earthquakes vary in size. Usually, we divide earthquakes into twelve degrees. Minor tremors can only be slightly felt; severe earthquakes often cause great disasters.
    However, earthquakes also have a function: they reveal the secrets of the depths of the earth.
    When an earthquake occurs, the earth experiences a kind of wave, like ripples in the water, spreading in all directions. This is a seismic wave. When seismic waves pass through different substances, they are refracted and reflected like light. The seismic wave passes through the earth's core and comes to the surface, where it is recorded by a seismograph. Studying these recorded seismic waves can help us understand the conditions underground. It not only reports the structure of the earth to us, but also tells us where there are minerals.
    Although natural seismic waves are not under our control, people can create earthquakes—by exploding a small package of explosives underground.
    Finally, we should also mention that the world's first seismologist was Zhang Heng of the Eastern Han Dynasty in our country. He invented the world's oldest seismograph—the Houfeng Didong Yi (earthquake weathercock). This is something we can be proud of.

### 是什么力量掀动了大地？

　　是什么力量掀动了大地？
　　祁文霖
    许多人认为，世界上没有任何东西能比大地更稳重、更安静。然而，这是错觉。6日人民日报四版就刊载了蒙古人民共和国的西部和我国西北部发生地震的消息。这个事实告诉我们，大地并不安稳，她在颤栗着、咆哮着，当她发脾气的时候，竟会弄得地裂山崩。
    1923年，日本东京曾经发生了一次地震，损坏建筑物五十万座，死人十万以上。要知道，这不过是发生在几秒钟里的事！
    这种震撼大地的巨大的力量，是从哪儿来的呢？
    有人说，这是神的意志。
    我们都很熟悉“女娲补天”这个神话故事。其中提到，女娲娘娘在炼石补天的时候，曾经捉了四只巨鳌来驮着大地，当它驮得不耐烦的时候，就要翻翻身、伸伸懒腰，于是，大地就动撼起来了。
    在外国，也有类似的传说。不过，鳌鱼却换成了鲸鱼、大象、金龟之类的东西。
    神话毕竟不是科学。地震的原因，还得由科学家来回答。现代科学已经肯定，这种使大地撼动的力量，是地球内部动力活动的结果。
    地下巨大的石灰岩洞的崩塌，能使大地陷裂、山岳崩毁，这就是“陷落地震”。这种地震的次数虽不算少，但影响的范围并不大。
    火山爆发时，有时也会伴随着发生地震。这叫火山地震。火山活动的时候，岩浆冲击着地壳向外喷发，这时，地层深处时常产生爆炸，因而使大地发生震动。火山地震有时可以波及几十公里，但影响范围只限火山周围，而且次数也不多。
    能够发生强烈地震，而且影响范围较大的，是构造地震。这主要是由于地球的内力作用，引起地层断裂而形成的。平常所发生的地震，大多属于这一种。
    地震多半发生在地壳比较脆弱的地区。像太平洋的沿岸和从欧洲阿尔卑斯山到亚洲喜马拉雅山一带，是世界上容易发生地震的地区。日本就是受地震威胁最严重的国家，在那块不大的土地上，平均每天就有四次地震。
    地震有大有小，通常我们把地震分成十二度。微小的震动，人们只能稍有一些感觉；剧烈的地震，往往会造成很大的灾害。
    但是，地震也有一个作用，它泄露了地下深处的秘密。
    当地震的时候，大地发生了一种波动，就像水的波纹一样，传向四面八方，这就是地震波。地震波经过不同的物质时，也像光线一样发生折射和反射。地震波穿过了地心，来到地面上，地震仪就把它记录下来。研究这种记录下来的地震波，就能够帮助我们了解地下的情况。它不但向我们报告地球的构造，还告诉我们哪里有矿。
    天然的地震波虽然不受我们的控制，但人们可以制造地震——用一小包炸药在地下爆炸，也就行了。
    最后，我们还应该提到，世界上第一个地震学家就是我国东汉时代的张衡，他发明了世界上最古老的地震仪——候风地动仪。这是值得我们自豪的。
