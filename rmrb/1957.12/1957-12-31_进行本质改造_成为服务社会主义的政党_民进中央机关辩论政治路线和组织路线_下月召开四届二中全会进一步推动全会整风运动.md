    In-depth Essential Transformation: Becoming a Party Serving Socialism
    The Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy Debates Political and Organizational Lines
    The Fourth Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee Will Be Held Next Month to Further Promote the Rectification Movement of the Whole Association
    (Our newspaper reports) The rectification movement in the central organs of the China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD) has formed a mass upsurge of airing views. From the end of October to December 30, the masses put forward 1,091 opinions through various means, with an average of six big-character posters per cadre. The content of the opinions put forward by the masses is very broad. Some criticized the mistakes of the CAPD Central Committee in implementing guidelines and policies, demanding an in-depth examination of the association's political and organizational lines, as well as some work arrangements during the period of assisting the Party in rectification; some questioned and criticized by name the erroneous remarks made by leading comrades and cadres in the early stage of airing views, demanding an examination of their political stance; and many others put forward active criticisms and suggestions for improvement on leadership style, work systems, organizational structure, cadre policies, administrative management, and other aspects.
    The Rectification Leading Group of the CAPD Central Committee attached great importance to the opinions of the masses. Leaders such as Wang Shao'ao, Zhou Jianren, and Xu Guangping, vice chairmen of the Central Committee, attended meetings to carefully view the big-character posters and went deep into the groups to listen to the masses' airing of views. Secretary-General Yang Dongchun, Deputy Secretary-Generals Xu Boxin, Feng Binfu, and Ge Zhicheng also put up big-character posters, expressing their welcome to the masses' criticisms and their intention to conduct in-depth self-examination and transformation.
    In the past two months, the Rectification Leading Group has held three general cadre meetings, made mobilization reports on the rectification, and gradually dispelled the ideological concerns of the masses, enabling the movement to develop in depth. At the recently held cadre meeting, Yang Dongchun, director of the Rectification Office, made a summary of the previous stage of rectification. Yang Dongchun said that great achievements have been made in the rectification over the past month. The large number of opinions put forward by the masses are basically good and are of great benefit to transforming our stance, examining leadership thinking, and overcoming shortcomings in our work. In the past, the CAPD Central Committee lacked an atmosphere of criticism, but now it can put forward opinions face-to-face and back-to-back, which is the development of socialist democracy. However, the airing of views is not deep enough, and it is required to be broader and deeper. Yang Dongchun expressed that the CAPD Central Committee is determined to carry out the rectification thoroughly, burn the fire on itself, and completely transform the CAPD's political and organizational appearance. Yang Dongchun pointed out that the next stage of rectification in the CAPD Central Committee organs will be combined with the general rectification of the central leadership. Central leaders will participate in the study groups of the organs and will conduct special debates on major issues such as the association's political and organizational lines, the bourgeois nature of political parties, and the transformation of intellectuals. Yang Dongchun also announced that the Central Rectification Leading Group decided to establish three special groups to handle the opinions of the masses according to the nature of the problems, so as to rectify and reform simultaneously. Now, in accordance with the spirit of "picking up sesame seeds first and then embracing watermelons," 94 opinions put forward by the masses have been resolved in a timely manner. For issues involving larger issues that require careful study, such as the organizational system, work system, and personnel arrangements, it is planned to conduct special airing of views and resolve them after debate.
    At present, the rectification of the CAPD Central Committee organs has entered the stage of special airing of views and major debates. Starting from December 28, in combination with the actual problems revealed in the airing of views, a major debate has begun on the CAPD's political and organizational lines.
    (Our newspaper reports) The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy has decided to convene the Fourth Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee in Beijing in mid-January 1958.
    This meeting will discuss the gains and experiences of the CAPD Central Committee in the anti-Rightist struggle, the handling of Rightist elements, and will exchange experiences in carrying out general rectification, in order to further promote the rectification movement of the whole association. The meeting will also conduct debates on issues related to the essential transformation of the CAPD.

    进行本质改造　成为服务社会主义的政党
    民进中央机关辩论政治路线和组织路线
    下月召开四届二中全会进一步推动全会整风运动
    本报讯　中国民主促进会中央机关的整风运动，已形成一个群众性的鸣放高潮。从10月底到12月30日，群众通过各种方式，提出了一千零九十一条意见，平均每个干部贴了六张大字报。群众提出的意见内容非常广泛，有些批评了民进中央在执行方针政策上的错误，要求深入检查会的政治路线和组织路线，以及帮助党整风期间的一些工作布置；有些指名指姓地对领导同志及干部在鸣放初期发表的错误言论，提出质问和批评，要求检查政治立场；还有许多人对领导作风、工作制度、组织机构、干部政策、行政管理等方面，提出了积极的批评和改进意见。
    民进中央整风领导小组对群众的意见十分重视。中央副主席王绍鏊、周建人、许广平等领导人都到会仔细地观看了大字报，并深入小组听取群众鸣放。秘书长杨东蓴、副秘书长徐伯昕、冯宾符、葛志成也贴出大字报，表示欢迎群众提出批评，并要深入检查改造自己。
    近两个月来，整风领导小组已召开三次全体干部大会，作了整风的动员报告，逐步解除了群众思想顾虑，使运动得以深入展开。在最近召开的干部大会上，整风办公室主任杨东蓴作了前一阶段整风的小结。杨东蓴说，整风一个多月来已有很大成绩。群众提出的大量意见基本上是好的，对改造我们立场，检查领导思想，克服工作缺点大有好处。民进中央过去缺乏批评空气，现在能面对面、背对背地提出意见，这是开展了社会主义的民主。但是鸣放还不够深入，还要求放得更广更深。杨东蓴表示民进中央有决心把整风搞好搞透，把火烧到自己身上，彻底改造民进的政治面貌和组织面貌。杨东蓴指出下一阶段民进中央机关的整风和中央领导层的一般整风结合进行。中央领导人分别参加机关的学习小组，并将就会的政治路线与组织路线、资产阶级性政党及知识分子改造等重大问题，展开专题大辩论。杨东蓴并宣布中央整风领导小组决定成立三个专门小组，按问题性质来处理群众的意见，做到边整边改。现在已根据“先拣芝麻，后抱西瓜”的精神，及时解决了群众提出的九十四条意见。对牵涉较大，需要进行慎重研究的问题，如机构体制、工作制度、人事安排等，准备进行专题鸣放，辩论后解决。
    目前，民进中央机关的整改已转入专题鸣放和大辩论阶段。从12月28日起，已结合鸣放中揭发出来的实际问题，先就民进的政治路线和组织路线开始大辩论。
    本报讯　中国民主促进会中央常务委员会决定在1958年1月中旬在北京召开第四届中央委员会第二次全体会议。
    这次会议将讨论民进中央反右派斗争的收获和经验、对右派分子的处理等问题，并将交流开展一般整风的经验，以进一步推动全会整风运动。会议还将就有关民进本质改造问题进行辩论。
