Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 21st: The Chinese Communist Party members of the Tianjin East Asia Wool and Linen Textile Factory, during the rectification campaign, actively restored their original close relationship with the masses, extensively befriended non-Party members, greatly improved the relationship between the Party and non-Party members, and promoted production.

Since liberation, the East Asia Wool and Linen Textile Factory has recruited nearly three hundred Party members. Before joining the Party, these members had close ties with the masses and their closest friends. After joining the Party, many people maintained their original connections with the masses, but some, either because they were promoted to cadres or transferred to other jobs and had more social activities, had less contact with workers. More seriously, some people developed a sense of pride and complacency after joining the Party or becoming cadres, believing that the masses were backward in their thinking and were unwilling to approach the masses or even looked down upon them, thus becoming detached from the masses.

During the rectification campaign, employees criticized this situation, saying that these Party members were no longer warm and approachable after joining the Party and had become arrogant. Of the 21,536 opinions raised by the factory's employees, 36% concerned the ideological work style of leaders and Party members. Based on the opinions of the masses, the Party organization held a general meeting of all Party members in late November, made a report summarizing the opinions of the masses, and required Party members to deeply examine their shortcomings and mistakes and strengthen their ties with the masses. If each Party member could make five friends, all two thousand four hundred employees in the factory could be closely united around the Party to improve production together. The Party organization called on every Party member to extensively befriend non-Party members, first of all, to restore the original mass relationship.

After the meeting, a movement to "restore relationships" and "make friends" was widely launched. Many people took advantage of their days off or breaks to visit, hold small-scale heart-to-heart meetings, or conduct individual conversations. Searching for friends and visiting old acquaintances were seen everywhere. Zhang Guoxun, deputy secretary of the Party branch, and Qi Baoyuan, chairman of the trade union, had more than ninety good old friends in total, and each of them had restored relations with more than a dozen old friends. Luan Jiquan, the propaganda committee member of the Party branch who had recently joined the factory, examined his shortcomings to twelve workers and made new friends with them.

Through these activities, the relationship between the Party and the masses has greatly improved. Huang Hucheng, a maintenance worker and leader of the trade union group, had worked in the same workshop with Xu Enxin and Ling Xianben, also maintenance workers, before liberation. They also lived in Hedong and often went to and from work together. In 1952, they moved into the workers' new village and lived in the same courtyard. However, after Huang Hucheng joined the Party in 1953, he felt that he "couldn't talk to them" and forgot how his progress had come about, so he slowly became unwilling to approach his old friends. They did not interact even though they lived in the same courtyard, and rarely talked even though they worked in the same workshop. This time, Huang Hucheng realized his mistake and found his old friends to examine his erroneous thoughts, and their relationship became close again. In the past half-month, they have consulted each other on everything. Wang Guangsheng, director of the flax spinning workshop, was an old worker in the factory and had a good relationship with his colleagues. Later, he joined the Party and became a cadre, and he was so "busy" that he forgot the masses. This time, he held three heart-to-heart meetings with his old friends and examined his shortcomings of being detached from the masses. Old workers Zhang Youxing and Zhang Minglu were very touched and spoke from the heart. Zhang Minglu self-critically said: "It takes two hands to clap. Party members have the idea of being 'remarkable,' and I myself have the strange idea of 'don't flatter.' Now the director is examining himself to us. There has never been such a thing in the past. I deeply feel the greatness of the Party. This is a very good education for me, and I must also change my strange thinking." Someone else said: "If Guangsheng doesn't do a good job in the future, we will also be responsible." Song Zhiping, deputy director of the fine spinning workshop, and Wang Huailin, a member of the Party branch, have both made new friends with Zhao Youting and others. Zhao Youting is an old maintenance worker in the fine spinning workshop and has rich production experience, but Song Zhiping subjectively believed that he was backward and looked down on him, so even though they worked in the same workshop, he did not consult with him on matters. Therefore, Zhao Youting felt cold and his work enthusiasm was not well utilized. This time, Song Zhiping and Wang Huailin took the initiative to visit, examined their subjective shortcomings, and helped him solve his difficulties in life, which made the old worker very moved. He said: "I am sorry for you, I have not properly used my skills. I must work hard in production in the future to answer you." Since then, he has become active, constantly checking the machines or teaching people technology. He did not rest even though his right hand was injured at work. On the 18th and 19th, he continuously solved two key problems in production and improved product quality.

So far, 208 Party members in the factory have restored their original close relationships or made new friends with more than 840 non-Party members. Some branches have made contacting the masses a system. The political atmosphere in the factory has been very active recently, and everywhere is a scene of vitality. Some people who did not go to the Party branch in the past now go to the branch to talk about things.

The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that the experience of this factory is of universal significance and should be promoted. The Tianjin Daily published an editorial on the 18th entitled "Don't Forget the Contact with the Masses," believing that the spirit of the East Asia Wool and Linen Textile Factory in earnestly improving its relationship with the masses is worth advocating vigorously, and called on Party organizations in various units to combine the current rectification work to educate Party members to take various methods to further strengthen their close ties with the masses. The editorial also pointed out: Further strengthening ties with the masses cannot be just a "gust of wind" or "temporary expediency," but must stipulate certain systems and adhere to them regularly. Every Party member and cadre should always care about the masses, get closer to the masses in life and work, share weal and woe with the masses, breathe together, talk to them from the heart, help them solve difficult problems, and humbly learn from their strengths, listen to their criticisms and suggestions. Only through close contact in life and mutual assistance in work can we better achieve mutual concern and common progress in politics and ideology, and further unite and rely on the masses to better complete production and work tasks.

### 全体党员都同群众交朋友  东亚毛麻纺织厂朝气勃勃

    全体党员都同群众交朋友
    东亚毛麻纺织厂朝气勃勃
    本报特约新华社天津21日电  天津市东亚毛麻纺织厂的中共党员，在整风中积极恢复和群众原有的密切关系，广泛地和非党群众交朋友，大大改善了党和非党的关系，推动了生产。
    东亚毛麻纺织厂在解放以来共发展了近三百个党员。这些党员在入党前都和群众有着密切的联系，有着自己最亲密的朋友。在入党以后，许多人保持了和群众故有的联系，但也有些人或者因为提拔当了干部，或者调动了工作，社会活动较多，便和工人接触少了。更严重的是，有些人因为入党或当干部后滋长了骄傲自满的情绪，认为群众思想落后，不愿意接近群众甚至看不起群众，因而脱离了群众。
    在整风中，职工们对这种情况提出了批评，说这些党员入党以后不亲热了，架子大了。在全厂职工提出的二万一千五百三十六条意见中，有关领导人员和党员思想作风的占36％。根据群众的意见，党组织在11月下旬召开全体党员大会，综合群众意见作了报告，要求党员深刻检查自己的缺点和错误，加强同群众的联系。如果每一个党员能交五个朋友，就可以把全厂二千四百多人都紧密团结在党的周围，共同搞好生产。党组织号召每一个党员广泛同非党群众交朋友，首先要恢复原有的群众关系。
    会后，一个“恢复关系”、“交朋友”的运动就广泛地展开了。许多人都利用工休日或休息时间登门拜访，召开小型的谈心会或进行个别谈话。寻友，访旧，到处可见。党总支副书记张国勋、工会主席祁宝元二人共有九十多个相好的老朋友，各人已经分别同十几个老朋友恢复了关系。到厂不久的党总支宣传委员栾吉泉向十二个工人检查了自己的缺点，并和他们新交了朋友。
    经过这些活动，党群关系有了很大的改善。保全工人、工会小组长黄虎城同保全工人许恩信、凌先本，解放前就在一个车间做工，又都住在河东，经常一块上下班，1952年又一同搬进工人新村住在一个院里。但是黄虎城在1953年入党以后，因为自己感到“和他们说不到一块儿”，忘记了自己的进步是怎样来的，就慢慢不愿意接近老朋友，住在一个院里没有来往过，在一个车间工作，也很少交谈。这次，黄虎城认识到自己的不对，便找到老朋友检查了自己的错误思想，彼此的关系又密切了。近半个月来，他们有事都互相商量了。麻纺车间主任王广盛原是这个厂的老工人，哥儿弟兄很好，后来他入了党，又当了干部，就“忙”的把群众忘了。这回，他分别和老朋友举行了三次谈心会，向大家检查了自己脱离群众的缺点。老工人张有兴、张明录等都很感动，谈出了知心话。张明录自我检查说：一个巴掌拍不响，党员有“了不起”的思想，我自己也有“别巴结”的怪思想。现在主任向我们作检查，过去哪有这样的事，我深深感到党的伟大。这对我是一次很好的教育，我也要转变自个儿的怪思想。还有人说：“今后广盛做不好工作，咱们也要负责任。”细纱车间副主任宋治平和党支部委员王怀林，都同赵幼亭等新结成了朋友。赵幼亭是细纱车间的保全老工人，有丰富的生产经验，但是宋治平主观地认为人家落后，看不起人家，所以虽然在一个车间工作，有事也不和他商量。因此，赵幼亭感到冷淡，工作积极性没有很好的发挥。这次，宋治平和王怀林都主动登门拜访，检查自己的主观缺点，并且帮助他解决生活上的困难问题，使这位老工人非常感动。他说：我对不起你们，没有好好把技术发挥出来，今后一定要在生产上好好地干来回答你们。从此以后，他就积极起来了，每天不停地检查机器或者教人技术。右手因工受伤也不休息，在18、19日两天，还连续解决了生产中的两个关键问题，提高了产品质量。
    到目前为止，全厂已经有二百零八个党员同八百四十多个非党群众恢复了原有的亲密关系或新结为朋友。有的支部已经把联系群众定成制度。这个工厂近来的政治空气非常活跃，到处是一片生气勃勃的景象。有些过去不到党支部去的人，现在有事都要找支部谈了。
    中共天津市委认为，这个厂的经验具有普遍的意义，应该推广。18日的天津日报曾以“不要忘了同群众的联系”为题发表了社论，认为东亚毛麻纺织厂这种认真改善同群众关系的精神值得大力提倡，号召各单位的党组织结合当前的整改工作，教育党员采取多种多样的办法进一步加强同群众的密切联系。社论并且指出：进一步密切同群众的联系不能只是“一阵风”或“临时抱佛脚”，而必须规定一定的制度，经常坚持下去。每个党员和干部，应当时刻关心群众，从生活上和工作上同群众多多接近，同群众同甘苦，共呼吸，同他们讲知心话，帮助他们解决困难问题，并且虚心学习他们的长处，听取他们的批评和建议。只有通过生活上的接近，工作上的互助，才能更好地达到政治上思想上的互相关心，共同进步，进一步团结和依靠群众更好地完成生产和工作任务。
