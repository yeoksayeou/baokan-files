Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou Electric Dispatch: The four mu and seven li of experimental fields in Yancheng County, Henan Province, created a high-yield record this year, averaging 1,009 jin of flue-cured tobacco per mu.

　　This experimental field was cultivated by the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative of Liji Township, Yancheng County, under the specific guidance of the local agricultural technology extension station. The variety is a high-yielding, multi-leaf tobacco variety introduced from Yunnan. During the cultivation process, they carried out meticulous management work. During the rainy and windy seasons in spring, two timely transplantations were carried out to ensure full seedlings. Later, in view of the uneven growth of the tobacco seedlings, top dressing was applied to each plant in stages. In addition, pesticides were sprayed and soil was cultivated to seal the roots in a timely manner to prevent aphids and diseases. Therefore, the tobacco plants grew strongly, with a maximum of one hundred and twenty leaves per plant.

　　河南烤烟田一千零九斤
    据新华社郑州电  河南郾城县有四亩七分一厘试验田，今年创造了平均亩产烤烟一千零九斤的高产纪录。
    这块试验田是郾城县李集乡光明农业社在当地农业技术推广站的具体指导下培植的。品种是从云南引进的高产品种多叶烟。在培植过程中，他们进行了细致的管理工作。春季多雨和大风时节，进行了两次适时移栽，保证了全苗，以后又针对烟苗生长高低强弱不一的情况，分期逐株地挖穴施上追肥。此外，又适时地喷撒农药和培土封根，防止了蚜虫和病害，因此烟棵生长健旺，最多的每棵有一百二十片叶。
