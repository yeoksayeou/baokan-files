Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to reports, the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, labor unions, and other social organizations held a mass rally in Maebashi City on the 2nd, attended by 1,000 people. The meeting passed a resolution demanding a retrial of the Girard case. The resolution also demanded that the United States return the Soumagahara Firing Range in Gunma Prefecture (where American soldier Girard shot and killed Sakae Nakako) to the local residents.
    The Japanese Supreme Public Prosecutors Office and the Maebashi District Public Prosecutors Office simultaneously announced on the 3rd that the Japanese prosecutorial authorities had decided not to appeal the judgment made by the Maebashi District Court on the American murderer Girard, which was in effect an acquittal. According to Western news agencies, the U.S. military authorities in Japan have decided to send Girard back to the United States on the 6th.
    When answering reporters' questions, Hanaei Tadashi, the Prosecutor General of the Japanese Supreme Public Prosecutors Office, admitted that the decision by Japan not to appeal the Girard case was made in consideration of "international relations"; although Hanaei Tadashi himself also stated that he "regretted" the lenient sentence given to Girard by the Maebashi District Court.
    Sakai Kayoko, the daughter of the victim Sakai Nakako, was very dissatisfied with the prosecutorial authorities' decision. She said that in order to value human life, the Japanese side should file an appeal.
    Asanuma Inejirō, the Secretary-General of the Japanese Socialist Party, said that the Japanese judicial authorities' decision not to appeal the Girard case shows "the obsequious nature of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet."

　　日本公众要求重审哲腊德
　　检察当局竟决定不对杀人犯上诉
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：日本共产党、社会党、工会和其他社会团体2日在前桥市召开了有一千人参加的群众大会。会上通过决议，要求重新审判哲腊德案件。决议还要求美国把群马县相马原打靶场（美国兵哲腊德就是在这个打靶场上打死坂井奈加子的）归还给当地居民。
    日本最高检察厅和前桥地方检察厅3日竟然同时宣布，日本检察当局决定不对前桥地方裁判所对美国杀人犯哲腊德作出的实际上无罪释放的判决提起上诉。据西方通讯社报道，驻日美军当局已经决定在6日把哲腊德送回美国。
    日本最高检察厅总检事长花井忠在回答记者的问题时承认，日本作出不对哲腊德案件提起上诉的决定是考虑到“国际关系”；尽管花井忠本人同时表示，他对前桥地方裁判所对哲腊德的从轻判决“感到遗憾”。
    被害者坂井奈加子的女儿坂井佳代子对于检察当局的这一决定非常不满。她说，为了重视人命，日本方面应该提起上诉。
    日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎说，日本司法当局决定不对哲腊德案件提起上诉，表明“岸信介内阁的卑躬屈节的性质”。
