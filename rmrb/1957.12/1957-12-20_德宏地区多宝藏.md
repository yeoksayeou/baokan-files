    Treasures Abound in the Dehong Area
    After two years of prospecting, the Yunnan Geological Survey and Exploration Team of the Ministry of Geology has proven that the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province has very rich reserves of minerals such as lead, zinc, copper, iron, tungsten, mercury, and mica.
    The lead-zinc deposit in the central part of the Autonomous Prefecture has reserves of more than 20,000 tons; preliminary surveys of another lead-zinc deposit have proven reserves of more than 35,000 tons. (Liang Ping)
