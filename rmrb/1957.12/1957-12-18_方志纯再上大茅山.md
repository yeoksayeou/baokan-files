Xinhua News Agency report by Qi Huangshi:

　　On December 1st, Fang Zichun, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, led an advance team marching towards Mount Da Mao, reaching a village at the foot of the mountain - Huaqiao Village in Dexing County. Looking up from the foot of the mountain, Mount Da Mao was shrouded in mist, a vast expanse of white.

　　Mount Da Mao is located on the border of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, with 600,000 mu of reclaimable mountain land. From 1927 to 1931, Fang Zichun was the commander of the Third Division of the Tenth Army of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. He, along with comrades Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping, persisted in guerrilla warfare for four years in the Da Mao and Mopan Mountains of the Min-Zhe-Gan Soviet Area, experiencing countless thrilling battles. Today, he has once again led comrades of the advance team to build Mount Da Mao, where he once fought.

　　On the 2nd, it rained. In order to survey the conditions in the mountainous area, after having breakfast at the township people's committee, Fang Zichun, his hair streaked with gray, took a wooden staff and climbed the mountain with everyone along a path overgrown with weeds. Reaching halfway up the mountain, Fang Zichun said to the comrades: "In the past, we were forced onto Mount Da Mao by the enemy, but what about today? We are here to build a new mountain area. In the future, we must widen the roads so that large quantities of bamboo, wood, and medicinal materials that are not being harvested can be transported out." Along the way, everyone picked up pine cones, shiitake mushrooms, bamboo husks, and hardwoods. These are inexhaustible treasures of the mountainous area: one hundred catties of pine cones can yield forty catties of pine oil; rosin can be used as medicine and is also a raw material for military industry; shiitake mushrooms fetch a high price; bamboo husks are the best raw material for papermaking; and dogwood is also a specialty here. Fang Zichun said, "In the future, we must develop these aspects of production well. Next year, we will also develop ten thousand Angora rabbits here and try raising Xinjiang sheep. In short, we must vigorously develop anything that generates high income, requires little investment, has a wide range of uses, and is suitable for mountain production."

　　They want to open up a comprehensive agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery reclamation farm on Mount Da Mao.

　　The drizzle continued incessantly, and everyone's clothes were soaked through. They crossed the branch of Mount Da Mao - Mount Xiao Mao, and arrived at Louqian Village. They stayed here overnight.

　　The next day, after walking about thirty more li of mountain road, they arrived at Wufeng Cave, where eight comrades from the Jiangxi Provincial Forestry Department's Wufeng Cave Management Office lived. There are no residents here, no post office, and no telephone. The comrades from the forestry management office were suddenly informed that a group of cadres had been sent down here, and everyone felt extremely excited. As it was getting dark, two comrades from the provincial and county postal and telecommunications bureaus also arrived. They came to contact the advance team to prepare for the establishment of a postal and telecommunications network.

　　That night, everyone sat around a roaring fire with the farmers who were working for the forestry management office, chatting. The firelight illuminated everyone's smiling faces. Everyone talked about how, during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War period, this place was originally a village with more than thirty households. After the Red Army went down the mountain, the Kuomintang reactionaries' burning and killing left not a single house or family; hundreds of mu of land had been abandoned for more than twenty years. Today, these farmers from the old revolutionary base areas met Comrade Fang Zichun, who led the Red Army in persisting in guerrilla warfare thirty years ago, and they were all particularly cordial. Fang Zichun sat on a long bench with the farmers, asking questions with concern, from the lives of the commune members to the care for the families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled revolutionary soldiers, to the establishment of a comprehensive agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery reclamation farm invested in by the state and the future prospects of mountain area construction.

　　As Fang Zichun spoke, he held the farmers' hands and finally sang songs from the Land Revolution War period with everyone.

　　Revolutionaries advance
　　Workers, peasants and soldiers united
　　Ten thousand people with one heart
　　Eliminate warlords, kill corruption
　　Local tyrants must be wiped clean
　　Down with the Kuomintang
　　Eliminate the White Army...

　　The lyrics evoked everyone's memories and further inspired confidence in building the mountain area today.

　　After staying in Wufeng Cave for a day, they walked another forty more li of mountain road and arrived at Raoerdun. This is the seat of the district people's committee, with about two hundred households of residents. Fang Zichun visited several farmers' families and inspected the work of the district committee, health center, People's Bank office, supply and marketing cooperative, and other agencies. The next morning, just as they were about to depart, farmer Liu Shuisheng traveled from twenty li away with a basket of eggs to see Fang Zichun and invite Fang Zichun to his home. Fang Zichun received him and promised to visit his home after some time. It turned out that he was the ordinary farmer who, in the past, braved hardship and danger to save the life of Fang Zhimin's wife, Miao Min.

　　After bidding farewell to farmer Liu Shuisheng, Fang Zichun led the comrades of the advance team towards Wangshan to continue surveying and planning the Da Mao Mountain reclamation farm. (Attached pictures)

　　方志纯再上大茅山
    新华社记者　漆荒诗
    12月1日，中共江西省委书记方志纯率领的向大茅山进军的先遣队，到达了大茅山下的一个村庄——德兴县花桥村。从山下往上看，大茅山上雾气弥漫，一片白茫茫。
    大茅山位于浙赣两省的边境，可开垦的山地达六十万亩。1927年到1931年，方志纯曾经是工农红军第十军第三师的师长，他与方志敏、邵式平等同志在闽浙赣苏区的大茅山、磨盘山一带坚持过四年的游击战争，经历了无数次惊险的战斗。今天，他又带领先遣队的同志们来建设他曾经在这里战斗过的大茅山来了。
    2日，天雨。为了探测山区的情况，在乡人民委员会用过早餐后，头发斑白的方志纯手拿木杖，沿着一条杂草丛生的小路同大家一起上山。登到半山，方志纯和同志们说：“过去我们是被敌人逼上大茅山的，而今天呢？我们为了建设新山区。今后我们要把路修宽些，让大片的、无人采伐的竹木和药材都运出去”。大家一路拾起了松子、香菇、竹壳和硬木。这些都是山区取之不尽的财富：一百斤松子就可以榨松油四十斤，松香可以作药，还是军事工业的原料；香菇售价很高，竹壳是造纸最好的原料；还有梭子木也是这里的特产。方志纯说：“今后我们要很好的发展这些方面的生产。明年一年，还要在这里发展一万只安哥拉兔子，还要试养新疆绵羊。总之，收入多，投资小，用途广，适宜于山地生产的，我们都要大力发展”。
    他们要在大茅山开辟出一个农林牧渔综合垦殖场。
    细雨下个不停，大家的衣裤全湿透了。他们越过了大茅山的支脉——小茅山，到了楼前村。这一天天黑就住在这里。
    第二天，大约又走了三十多里的山路，就到了乌风洞，这里住着江西省林业厅乌风洞经营所的八个同志。这里没有一户居民，没有邮政，也不通电话。林业经营所的几个同志突然得知了一批干部下放到这里，每个人都感到无比的兴奋。到天快黑的时候，省、县邮电局的两位同志也赶到了，他们是来同先遣队联系，准备建立邮电网的。
    这天晚上，大家同为林业经营所出工的农民们围着一团熊熊大火谈天，火光映着每个人的笑脸。大家谈到，在第二次国内革命战争时期，这里原是住着三十多户人家的一个村庄，红军下山后，国民党反动派的烧杀使这里没有剩下一幢房子，一户人家；数百亩的土地已经荒废二十几年了。今天，这些革命老根据地的农民们又会见了三十年前领导红军坚持游击战争的方志纯同志，都特别亲切。方志纯和农民们坐在一条长凳上，关心地询问着，从社员的生活，谈到革命烈士的家属、革命残废军人的优抚情况，谈到要在这里建立一个由国家投资的农林牧渔综合垦殖场和今后山区建设的远景。
    方志纯一面谈着，一面拉着农民的手，最后和大家唱起了土地革命战争时期的歌曲。
    革命大家向前进
    工农兵联合
    万众一条心
    除军阀、杀贪污
    土劣要灭清
    打倒国民党
    消灭白色军……
    歌词唤起了大家的回忆，更鼓舞着对今天建设山区的信心。
    在乌风洞住了一天以后，又走了四十多里的山路，到了绕二墩。这里是区人民委员会所在地，居民约两百户。方志纯探望了几个农民的家庭，并检查了区委会、卫生所、人民银行办事处、供销社等机关单位的工作。第二天早上，正要出发的时候，农民刘水生从二十里路外的地方提了一篮子鸡蛋赶来看方志纯，要方志纯到他家中去。方志纯接待了他，答应了经过一些时候一定去他家。原来他就是过去不畏艰险，救了方志敏同志的爱人缪敏的生命的一个普通农民。
    送别了农民刘水生之后，方志纯率领先遣队的同志们向汪山进发，继续勘测、规划大茅山的垦殖场。（附图片）
