    Consolidate National Unification and Ethnic Unity
    Tibetan Cadres in Ganzi Criticize Local Nationalism

    (People's Daily News) At a symposium of ethnic minority party members and cadres convened by the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, attendees discussed Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report on the rectification movement and unanimously expressed their support for the report.

    At the meeting, Sangji Yexi (Tibetan), First Secretary of the Prefectural Party Committee, made an important speech on criticizing local nationalism. Sangji Yexi said: The Central Committee of the Party proposed carrying out rectification within the Party among ethnic minorities based on different situations, and conducting appropriate socialist education among the people. This instruction is completely timely, correct, and necessary. He said that currently, local nationalism has seen a new resurgence among many ethnic minorities. It reflects the struggle and resistance of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes among ethnic minorities in the face of the continuous victories of the socialist revolution. Rightists among ethnic minorities always wave the banner of ethnicity, appearing to defend so-called ethnic interests, when they engage in anti-Party, anti-socialist activities, divide ethnic unity, and undermine national unification. Local nationalists are essentially a part of the bourgeois rightists, rightists in ethnic clothing.

    After affirming the significant achievements made by the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in recent years under the leadership and care of the Party, Sangji Yexi said that, based on the situation reflected by some ethnic minority cadres recently, local nationalism in the Ganzi area has also seen a new resurgence, mainly manifested in the following aspects: First, disobedience to the leadership of the Party and failure to implement organizational resolutions. For example, some people would absent themselves from relevant meetings convened by the county Party committee without authorization; they would not conscientiously implement the resolutions of the county Party committee. Second, disrespect for the leadership of Han comrades and rejection of assistance from Han cadres, and they would use the pretext of autonomy to exclude Han cadres. Some people said: "We Tibetans are the masters, and the Han people should obey us in everything." They behaved in a special way in everything. Third, doubts and resistance to certain policies of the Party. A few people have an unclear understanding of the destructive activities carried out by rightists waving the banner of ethnicity, and even listen to rumors spread by counter-revolutionary elements. Fourth, when various desires of bourgeois individualism are not satisfied, they blame everyone and everything. Many people now do not study diligently, do not work hard, and make unreasonable demands for fame, status, grades, and treatment. Their lives are not difficult, but they demand public subsidies. When the leaders explain, they say: "You do not care about ethnic cadres." In addition, individual persons spread reactionary remarks, slander the Communist Party, and defame the policies of the Party, etc. Sangji Yexi finally said that the above situation shows that the ideological behavior of various kinds of bourgeois local nationalism among ethnic minority cadres is serious. If it is allowed to develop, it will be extremely dangerous for the ethnic group or individuals. In order to raise the class consciousness of cadres of all ethnic groups and improve their work style, the Prefectural Party Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, has decided to conduct socialist ideological education among all cadres. He called on everyone to be determined to participate in the study and to resolutely overcome bourgeois local nationalism, like the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and further strengthen ethnic unity. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they should strive to build a socialist motherland family with common prosperity for all ethnic groups.

    The ethnic minority party members and cadres who participated in the meeting unanimously believed in their speeches that the harmfulness of local nationalism is great, and they all felt that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report was very enlightening to them. Shana (Tibetan), Secretary of the Ganzi Prefectural Party Committee and Governor of the Autonomous Prefecture, said: To fundamentally end national oppression and exploitation, and to get rid of poverty and backwardness forever, we must unswervingly follow the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party, and resolutely oppose local nationalist ideas and behaviors that undermine national unity and undermine national unification. Chi Nai (Tibetan), Section Chief of the United Front Work Department of the Ganzi Prefectural Party Committee, said that local nationalist ideas and behaviors are not conducive to the unification of the motherland and the unity between ethnic groups, and are not beneficial to their own progress. Only by resolutely criticizing local nationalism and raising the socialist consciousness of cadres can we smoothly complete democratic reforms and socialist construction. Luo Tongda (Tibetan), Deputy County Head of Yajiang County, and Yixi Duoji (Tibetan), Director of the Propaganda Department of the Ganzi Prefectural Committee of the Communist Youth League, in addition to using concrete facts to illustrate the growth and harmfulness of local nationalism among some ethnic minority cadres in recent years, both believed that local nationalist ideas and behaviors are bourgeois anti-socialist ideas and behaviors, and therefore, socialist education must be carried out to oppose local nationalism and raise the socialist consciousness of the people.

    巩固祖国统一和民族团结
　　甘孜藏族干部批判地方民族主义
    本报讯　在中共甘孜藏族自治州委召开的少数民族党员干部座谈会上，自治州一级的和来自各县的少数民族党员干部讨论了邓小平同志关于整风运动的报告，并一致表示拥护这个报告。
    会上，州委第一书记桑吉悦希（藏）就批判地方民族主义作了重要发言。桑吉悦希说：党中央提出在少数民族中分别不同情况在党内进行整风，在人民中适当进行社会主义教育，这一指示是完全适时的、正确的和必要的。他说，目前许多少数民族中，地方民族主义思想有了新的滋长。它反映了少数民族中资产阶级和其它剥削阶级在社会主义革命不断胜利形势下的挣扎和反抗。少数民族中的右派分子，在进行反党、反社会主义、分裂民族团结和破坏祖国统一的时候，总是打着民族旗帜，以维护所谓民族利益出现的。地方民族主义者，实质上是资产阶级右派的一部分，是披着民族外衣的右派分子。
    桑吉悦希在肯定了甘孜藏族自治州在党的领导和关怀下几年来所取得的重大成就后说，根据最近少数民族干部中一部分人反映出来的情况看，甘孜地区地方民族主义同样有了新的滋长，主要表现在以下几个方面：一、不服从党的领导，不执行组织决议。如有些人对县委召开的有关会议，不愿意参加时就擅自缺席；对县委决议，不认真贯彻执行。二、不尊重汉族负责同志的领导，不接受汉族干部的帮助，并且借口自治权利，排斥汉族干部。有人讲：“我们藏族是当家作主的，汉人就应该一切服从我们。”他们处处表现特殊。三、对党的某些政策怀疑抵触。有少数人对打着民族旗帜的右派分子所进行的破坏活动，认识不清，甚至听信反革命分子的谣言。四、资产阶级个人主义的各种欲望得不到满足时，就怨天尤人。现在有不少人不虚心学习，不好好工作，无原则的闹名誉地位、级别待遇，他们生活上并不困难，却要求公家补助，领导上解释时，就说：“不关心民族干部”。此外，还有个别人散布反动言论，诬蔑共产党和诽谤党的政策等。桑吉悦希最后说，上述情况，说明少数民族干部中形形色色的资产阶级地方民族主义的思想行为是严重的，如果让它发展下去，对于本民族或个人都是极其危险的。为了提高各族干部的阶级觉悟，改进作风，州委根据中央和省委的指示精神，确定在全体干部中进行社会主义的思想教育。他号召大家下定决心，参加学习，一定要和全国各民族人民一样，坚决克服资产阶级地方民族主义，进一步加强民族团结，在中国共产党的领导下，为建设各民族共同繁荣的社会主义的祖国大家庭而努力奋斗。
    参加会议的少数民族党员干部在发言中一致认为，地方民族主义倾向的危害性是很大的，都感到邓小平同志的报告对自己启发很大。中共甘孜州委书记处书记、自治州州长沙纳（藏）说：我们要从根本上结束民族压迫和剥削，永远摆脱贫困和落后，就必须在共产党的领导下，坚定不移地走社会主义的道路，坚决反对破坏民族团结和破坏祖国统一的地方民族主义思想行为。中共甘孜州委统战部科长赤耐（藏）说，地方民族主义的思想和行为，不利于祖国的统一和民族间的团结，对于自己的进步也是没有好处的。只有坚决地批判地方民族主义，提高干部的社会主义觉悟，才能够顺利地完成民主改革和社会主义建设。雅江县副县长罗通达（藏）和共青团甘孜州委宣传部长益西多吉（藏），除用具体事实说明近年来某些少数民族干部的地方民族主义有了滋长及其危害性以外，都认为：地方民族主义的思想、行为，是资产阶级的反社会主义的思想和行为，因此必须开展社会主义教育，反对地方民族主义，提高人民群众的社会主义觉悟。
