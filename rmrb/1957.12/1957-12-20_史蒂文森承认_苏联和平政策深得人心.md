Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 18th - TASS reported: American Democratic Party leader Adlai Stevenson delivered a speech in Chicago, complaining that the Soviet Union's implementation of a friendly and peaceful cooperation policy has won it new friends. He believes that "the Soviet Union will soon be able to attract the people of all countries that do not belong to any camp to its side." He said that judging from the developments in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, the United States "will soon lose its position in economically underdeveloped countries."

Stevenson said that last week the Soviet Union "won another victory." "When we talk about transporting atomic weapons to Western Europe, the Soviet Union wrote letters calling for a ban on nuclear bombs and calling for peace." He urged the government to adopt a more flexible policy, abandon "excessive self-confidence and arrogance," to achieve the goals that the United States currently hopes to achieve through its "position of strength" policy.

    史蒂文森承认
    苏联和平政策深得人心
    据新华社19日讯　塔斯社纽约18日讯：美国民主党领袖史蒂文森在芝加哥发表演说，抱怨苏联执行友好与和平合作政策使它获得新朋友。他认为“苏联很快就能够把不属于任何阵营的各国人民吸引到自己一边”。他说，根据亚洲、中东和非洲的事态发展来判断，美国“很快就会丧失它在经济不发达国家中的地位”。
    史蒂文森说，上星期苏联“又一次获得了胜利”。“当我们谈论把原子武器运到西欧的时候，苏联写了呼吁禁止核弹和呼吁和平的信件”。他要求政府采取更灵活的政策，放弃“过份自信和自高自大”，来达到美国目前希望借“实力地位”政策来达到的那些目的。
