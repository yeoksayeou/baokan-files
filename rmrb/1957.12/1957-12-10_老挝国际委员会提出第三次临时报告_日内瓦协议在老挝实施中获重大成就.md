    The International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos recently submitted its third interim report to the two co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference. The report covers the period from July 1, 1955, to May 16, 1957.

    The report summarizes the work done by the International Commission during the aforementioned period in monitoring and supervising the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos. The report focuses on the political and military negotiations between the Royal Lao Government and the former Pathet Lao forces, as well as the Commission's efforts to promote negotiations between the two sides and, when negotiations encountered difficulties, to promote the continuation of negotiations in an atmosphere of understanding and harmony.

    Thanks to the efforts of both sides in Laos and the positive role played by the International Commission, the two sides in Laos have reached various agreements on the establishment of a coalition government, and a coalition government with the participation of former Pathet Lao personnel was established on November 19. This is a significant achievement in the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos. The Lao International Commission has reported the establishment of the coalition government to the two co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference.

    老挝国际委员会提出第三次临时报告
　　日内瓦协议在老挝实施中获重大成就
    本报讯　驻在老挝的国际监察与监督委员会最近向日内瓦会议两位主席提出了第三次临时报告。报告所述及的期间自1955年7月1日起到1957年5月16日止。
    报告综述了上述期间国际委员会在监察和监督日内瓦协议在老挝的实施方面所做的工作。报告着重谈到了老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队之间历次的政治和军事谈判的经过情况，以及委员会在促使双方进行谈判和在谈判发生困难时促使双方在谅解与和协的气氛中继续进行谈判等方面所做的工作。
    由于老挝双方的努力和国际委员会所起的上述良好的作用，老挝双方已经达成关于成立联合政府的各项协议，并且已经在11月19日成立了有前寮国战斗部队人员参加的联合政府。这是日内瓦协议在老挝实施中的一项重大成就。老挝国际委员会已经把联合政府的成立报告了日内瓦会议的两位主席。
