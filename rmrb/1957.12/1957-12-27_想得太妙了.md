A Note

According to the "Washington Post," the "Gaither Committee's" "top secret report" pointed out that in order to realize its crazy arms expansion and war preparation plan, the United States should immediately cancel the upper limit of public debt and study increasing taxes. At a meeting of the US National Security Council, two US financial giants, McCloy and Lovett, told Eisenhower that the US financial community "will give full support" to this plan because they believe that "the American public will bear this burden."

The big bosses of Wall Street, in order to pursue war profits, of course support the government's arms expansion plan, but on what basis do they believe that the American people are willing to "sweat, shed tears," and even "bleed" in order to make them rich? Isn't that thinking a little too cleverly!

    想得太妙了
    据“华盛顿邮报”透露，“盖瑟委员会”的“绝密报告”指出，为了实现它的疯狂的扩军备战计划，美国应当立即取消公债的最高限额，并研究增加税收。在美国国家安全委员会的一次会议上，麦克洛埃和罗维特两个美国金融巨头向艾森豪威尔表示，美国金融界对这个计划“将给予完全支持”，因为他们相信，“美国公众会承担这个负担”。
    华尔街的大老板们为了追求战争利润，当然支持政府的扩军计划，但是他们根据什么相信美国人民肯于为了使他们发财而“流汗、流泪”，甚至“流血”呢？这未免想得太妙了吧！
