Comrades:

On behalf of the Central Council of the United Trade Unions of Iran and all the workers of our country, I congratulate the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, and through you, the great Chinese working people who are building socialism.

Dear comrades and friends, the People's Republic of China has made tremendous progress and achievements in the economic, cultural, and political life of the country in just eight years. Our working class and people are rejoiced by these achievements you have made. China, once a backward country subjected to the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, has now become a prosperous socialist country, and in the near future, it will become a great industrial power.

Fellow Delegates! Your congress is convened after the great festival, the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, has just passed. The October Revolution, completed under the leadership of the great Lenin and the Bolshevik Party, opened a new era for human society. Comrade Mao Zedong said that the salvo of the October Revolution brought Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese people. Before your congress convened, as Comrade Liu Shaoqi mentioned in his congratulatory message, two important and historically significant events occurred in the world. These two events proved that the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is invincible, and proved the unity of the working class and progressive forces in maintaining world peace. The first great event was the successful launch of artificial earth satellites by the Soviet Union, and the second great event was the declaration of the meeting of the Communist and Workers' Parties of twelve socialist countries in Moscow and the peace manifesto of the meeting of the Communist and Workers' Parties of sixty-four countries.

Comrades, the enemies of socialism and instigators of new wars are very alarmed and uneasy about these two major events. The second artificial satellite launched by the Soviet Union had a small dog named Laika used for experiments. When Laika was flying in the sky, the enemies were barking madly on earth, saying that the Communist and Workers' Parties' declaration and the peace manifesto were a serious threat to the imperialist bloc. Why are they clamoring so much? This is because, first, there are cracks within the imperialist bloc, and there will never be true unity; second, due to the unity of the socialist camp and the alliance of the world's working class and peace forces, the imperialist bloc's conspiracies and adventures to launch war cannot succeed.

Despite Comrade Khrushchev's repeated proposals for peaceful competition, the imperialists are frantically continuing the arms race. They are keen on preparing for new wars, but this is accelerating their inevitable process of death. The old capitalist world is destined to collapse and perish. It must be replaced by a socialist society.

The terror and murder practiced in Algeria, the bombing of Yemen and Oman, the threat to Syria and Egypt with the Eisenhower Doctrine, the signing of the Baghdad Pact, and so on, cannot save imperialism from its demise, nor can they hinder the liberation movements of colonial countries and dependent countries.

As for my country, Iran, you probably already know that the reactionary forces of Iran, with the support of American and British imperialism, organized a coup in August 1953, establishing a regime favorable to imperialism in order to resell our country's oil resources to American and British monopoly capitalists. Imperialism wants to eliminate our nation's resistance and attempts to turn our country, which borders the Soviet Union for two thousand five hundred kilometers, into a springboard for their war, and to establish military bases there. The Iranian authorities have abandoned our national interests and joined the Baghdad Pact after the failure of the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt. Our government has accepted the Eisenhower Doctrine.

Due to the rule of imperialism, the lives of Iranian workers and people of all ethnic groups have become extremely miserable. A police system has been implemented in the country, and thousands of participating workers and patriots have been imprisoned in extremely harsh prisons and concentration camps, and dozens have been killed or tortured to death.

In Iran, the cost of living and the prices of necessities have risen by 150% in the past three or four years. Wages are meager, working hours in some enterprises have been extended to ten hours, democratic rights and trade union rights have been violated, and workers are only allowed to assemble with the consent of the police station and under police supervision.

As for foreign policy, due to unemployment, poverty, persecution, and so on, thousands of Iranians have left their homes and gone abroad in search of work and bread.

Thanks to the Soviet Union's correct policy of peaceful coexistence and the demands of the Iranian people, normal good-neighborly relations have been established between Iran and the Soviet Union in recent times, and these good-neighborly relations are likely to be further developed in the future. In terms of relations with the People's Republic of China, the Iranian ruling clique, following the instructions of American imperialism, still does not recognize the People's Republic of China. Although all the people of our country demand the establishment of diplomatic relations with China, no relations have been established to date. If a referendum were held on this issue, I believe it would be difficult to find one hundred people among the twenty million Iranians who would vote against it. As the Iranian proverb says, "Although the bat does not want to see the sun, the value and usefulness of the sun are not diminished by this." I believe that in the near future, under the pressure of the masses of people from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea, our government will be forced to recognize the real Chinese government and sever relations with the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan. I also believe that all of America's vassals, and even American imperialism itself, will be forced to recognize China with its six hundred million people under the pressure of the demands of the masses of people.

Finally, I congratulate the Chinese working class, which is completing the socialist revolution and repelling the attacks of the bourgeois rightists with the active participation of the broad masses of people and the extensive promotion of democracy.

I express my heartfelt gratitude for the meticulous reception we have received during this Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, and for the invitation to our trade union delegation to the "May Day" celebration. The time is not far off when you will send a delegation to visit our country and accept the gifts we send to you.

Long live the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions!

Long live the Chinese working class and working people - the builders of socialism!

Long live the international solidarity of the world's working class and its representative, the World Federation of Trade Unions!

### 伊朗统一工会中央理事会总书记  鲁斯塔致词

专栏：

    伊朗统一工会中央理事会总书记
    鲁斯塔致词同志们：
    我代表伊朗统一工会中央理事会和我国全体劳动者，向中国工会第八次全国代表大会，并通过你们向正在建设社会主义的伟大的中国劳动人民祝贺。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，中华人民共和国在短短的八年中，在国家的经济、文化和政治生活中有了巨大的发展，并取得了巨大的成就。我们的工人阶级和人民都为你们所取得这些成就而欢欣鼓舞。中国过去是一个遭受帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义压迫的落后国家，现在已变成了繁荣的社会主义国家，在不久的将来，它将成为伟大的工业强国。
    代表同志们！你们的代表大会是在伟大的节日，即伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年纪念日刚刚度过以后召开的。在伟大的列宁和布尔什维克党的领导下所完成的十月革命，给人类的社会开辟了新纪元。毛泽东同志说过，十月革命一声炮响，给中国人民送来了马克思列宁主义。在你们的代表大会召开以前，正如刘少奇同志在祝词中所谈到的，世界上发生了两件重要的、具有历史意义的大事。这两件大事证明了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量所向无敌，证明了维护世界和平的工人阶级的力量和进步力量的团结一致。第一件大事是苏联发射人造地球卫星的成功，第二件大事是在莫斯科举行的十二个社会主义国家的共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言，和六十四个共产党和工人党代表会议的和平宣言。
    同志们，社会主义的敌人和新战争的挑拨者对这两件大事感到十分惊惶不安。苏联发射的第二颗人造卫星有一个叫莱依卡的用来作试验的小狗。这个莱依卡在天上飞行的时候，敌人就在地球上狂吠，说什么共产党和工人党宣言、和平宣言是对于帝国主义集团的严重威胁。他们为什么如此叫嚣呢？这是因为，第一，帝国主义集团内部有裂痕，永远不会有真正的团结；第二，由于社会主义阵营的团结和世界工人阶级的力量与和平力量的联合，帝国主义集团发动战争的阴谋和冒险就不能得逞。
    尽管赫鲁晓夫同志再三地提出和平竞赛，但帝国主义者正在疯狂地继续进行军备竞赛。他们热中于准备新的战争，但却因此而加速了自己不可避免的死亡过程。旧的资本主义世界是注定要崩溃和灭亡的。它必定要被社会主义社会所代替。
    在阿尔及利亚实行的恐怖与谋杀，对也门和阿曼的轰炸，用艾森豪威尔主义来威胁叙利亚和埃及，签订巴格达条约，以及其他等等，都无法挽救帝国主义的灭亡，也不能阻挠殖民地国家和附属国人民的解放运动。
    至于我的祖国伊朗，大概你们已经知道，伊朗的反动势力在美英帝国主义的扶持下，于1953年8月组织了政变，建立了对帝国主义有利的政权，以便把我国的石油资源重新出卖给美英垄断资本家。帝国主义想消灭我们民族的反抗，企图把与苏联接壤二千五百公里的我国疆土变为他们的战争跳板，在那里建立军事基地。伊朗的当权者背弃我们的民族利益，在英、法、以侵略埃及冒险行动失败以后，参加了巴格达条约。我国政府接受了艾森豪威尔主义。
    由于帝国主义的统治，伊朗工人及各族人民的生活变得痛苦不堪。在国内实行了警察制度，成千上万的参加斗争的工人和爱国者都被关进了条件非常恶劣的监牢和集中营，有好几十人已被杀害或被酷刑折磨而死。
    在伊朗，最近三、四年来生活费用和生活必需品的价格上涨了150％。工资微薄，某些企业的工时延长到十小时，民主权利和工会权利遭到侵犯，工人只有经警察局同意并在警察的监视下才允许集会。
    至于对外政策，由于失业、贫困、迫害等等原因，使成千上万的伊朗人离乡背井，外出寻找工作和面包。
    由于苏联正确的和平共处政策和伊朗人民的要求，在最近期间建立了伊苏之间正常的睦邻关系，这种睦邻关系在今后还有可能得到进一步的发展。在同中华人民共和国的关系方面，伊朗统治集团听从美帝国主义的指示，至今还不承认中华人民共和国。虽然我国全体人民都要求与中国建立邦交，但迄今还没有建立任何关系。如果就这个问题举行全民投票，我相信在两千万伊朗人民中很难找出一百个投反对票的人。伊朗谚语说得好：“蝙蝠虽然不愿见太阳，但太阳的价值和用处并不因此而逊色。”我相信在不久的将来，在从波斯湾直到里海的人民群众的压力下，我国政府是会被迫承认真正的中国政府，断绝与台湾蒋介石集团的关系的。我还相信美国的一切附庸国、甚至美帝国主义本身在人民群众要求的压力之下，也将要被迫承认六亿人民的中国。
    最后，我祝贺中国工人阶级，它正在完成社会主义革命，在广大人民群众的积极参加和广泛发扬民主的条件下，击退了资产阶级右派分子的进攻。
    我对中国工会这次代表大会期间给予我们关怀备至的接待，以及“五一”节对我国工会代表团的邀请，表示衷心的感谢。你们派代表团到我们的国家去访问、并接受我们送给你们礼品的时候，已经不远了。
    中国工会第八次全国代表大会万岁！
    中国工人阶级和劳动人民——社会主义的建设者万岁！
    全世界工人阶级国际团结及其代表者世界工联万岁！
