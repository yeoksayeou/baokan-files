Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 10th: The Second Session of the First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in Guangdong Province, which opened on November 21st in Guangzhou, closed on the 5th. Six hundred and forty-three delegates attended the congress, and seven hundred and three people attended as observers. The meeting deemed this to be a very good revolutionary promotion conference. The congress reflected a new surge in the revolutionary enthusiasm of millions of people in the province.

The meeting pointed out that a revolutionary heroic spirit, rarely seen for more than a year, has reappeared at this congress. This spirit was particularly evident during the congress's discussion of the great leap forward in agricultural production. The many original planned targets of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee were repeatedly exceeded. The Provincial Committee was not very confident in increasing grain production by 2 billion jin next year, but the congress affirmed that it could be achieved, and resolved to prepare for next year's spring plowing in a fighting posture, and must strive for a much larger harvest than the previous year. The Provincial Committee originally hoped that the garrison could allocate 2 million workdays to support this year's winter production, but the garrison guaranteed that it could support 3 million workdays. In order to meet the new high tide of production, the Provincial Committee originally planned to transfer 160,000 cadres to go to the countryside and mountains, but the congress passed a resolution to send 180,000 cadres to lower levels. The Provincial Committee originally planned to increase grain yield per mu from 510 jin this year to 850 jin by 1967, but the congress passed 900 jin, striving to reach 1,000 jin, and put forward the slogan of striving for a "thousand-jin grain province". The investment in water conservancy, excluding the central government's investment, will be increased from the original plan of 50 million yuan to 60 million yuan by the province this year, and from 20 million yuan to 40 million yuan by various regions, totaling 100 million yuan. (The original five-year plan for the province and local areas was 400 million yuan, which has now been increased to 500 million yuan.) This revolutionary spirit could be seen when the Party Congress discussed and approved this year's winter production plan, next year's production plan, and the twelve-year development plan. The voices of shouting difficulties without taking action, which had been popular for a year and could still be heard until the previous period, are no longer heard now. The entire congress showed very abundant revolutionary enthusiasm.

The revolutionary spirit shown at this congress has also influenced and created an atmosphere of learning from the advanced, valuing the advanced, and despising conservatism and backwardness. The advanced indicators of advanced units and advanced figures, especially their specific experience in increasing production, were generally respected and valued at the congress. The examples of Xinhui, Yangjiang, Chenghai, and Xingning counties, especially Hailing Island, relying only on everyone's hands to build small-scale water conservancy projects on a large scale without relying on national loans or chemical fertilizers, and obtaining high output increases, were even more valued by everyone. The speeches of dozens of representatives who introduced advanced experiences at the congress were extremely popular, and the delegations also used two-thirds of the entire congress period to learn and study advanced production increase measures. This kind of learning, in turn, enhanced the revolutionary enthusiasm of the delegations, combining enthusiasm with specific measures to increase production.

The meeting believed that what appeared at the same time as the revolutionary spirit at the congress was the high degree of principle shown in settling accounts with localist errors. Localist errors within the Guangdong Provincial Party organization have seriously undermined the party's unity and harmed the party's interests over the past year. At the congress, the delegations resolutely supported the Provincial Committee's leadership in the struggle against localism, made serious condemnations of localism, and made corresponding resolutions. All of this gave the Provincial Committee greater determination and confidence to quickly and thoroughly eliminate the influence of localism within the party.

The meeting pointed out that the revolutionary spirit in production and the high degree of principle in anti-localism could appear simultaneously and concentratedly at this Party Congress were by no means accidental phenomena. It reflects a new high tide of revolutionary enthusiasm among the broad masses of people in Guangdong Province. All the speeches at the congress reflected that after the rural socialist education movement, the anti-rightist struggle among cadres, and the dissemination of the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of people, especially the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and the majority of party members, generated a high degree of enthusiasm for building socialism. The current rural landscape is completely new compared to a few months ago. Before the socialist education movement, about only 30% of the peasant masses in Guangdong Province resolutely took the socialist road, 40% to 50% were wavering, and 20% to 30% wanted to take the capitalist road. Now, the number of people who resolutely take the socialist road has increased to 70% to 80%, about 20% are still wavering, and only less than 5% resolutely want to take the capitalist road, and they are very isolated. Not only has the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants been unprecedentedly improved, but their enthusiasm for developing production, especially developing collective production, and doing a good job in capital construction has also been unprecedentedly high. The province's winter production targets have been broken through repeatedly, and the attendance rate has generally reached more than 90%. In the speeches of representatives from various regions, there are many vivid examples of farmers' enthusiasm far exceeding that of the commune cadres, and the commune cadres far exceeding the leadership organs of the county. The labor enthusiasm of the poor and lower-middle peasant masses is very high. As long as they are properly guided, they will break through the winter production targets of the leading organs as soon as they act. In the materials of the representatives' speeches, there are dozens of agricultural cooperatives whose actual winter production figures exceed the planned targets of the county leadership organs by one, four, or even eight or nine times. The province's plan to exceed 5 million mu in winter planting area compared to last year has been nearly completed (that is, the plan to plant 20 million mu in winter has completed 19 million mu).

The meeting believed that the reason why the representatives were so confident and sure when they put forward advanced indicators to the congress was obviously strongly influenced by the new high tide of the rural revolution. Similarly, the reason why the Party Congress was able to so resolutely support the Provincial Committee's leadership in the anti-localism struggle was also the result of the representatives' greatly improved communist consciousness after the rectification and anti-rightist movement. The reason why the congress was able to be held as a revolutionary promotion conference, organized production showed revolutionary enthusiasm, and anti-localism showed a high degree of principle was also due to the Provincial Committee's thorough criticism of right-leaning conservatism and localism in the party's leading ideology during this period, especially at this Party Congress.

The meeting believed that in recent years, a right-leaning conservative ideology has existed within the Guangdong Provincial Party organization in dealing with many issues, especially in dealing with rural work issues. Some people in the party have always adopted an attitude of distrust towards the party's leading role and the strong power of collective farmers. They expressed doubts about the great achievements of agricultural production, opposed the agricultural production policy with grain as the main focus, and criticized the revolutionary spirit of the province's farmers in carrying out farmland capital construction and technical reforms after collectivization, while blindly exaggerating individual shortcomings in their work. In the second half of last year, while correctly opposing subjectivism, bureaucracy, and coercion in the work, insufficient attention was paid to protecting the revolutionary enthusiasm of cadres and the masses (the First Session of the First Congress of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee, which was held in August last year, had this shortcoming). Since the second half of last year, serious right-leaning thoughts have also occurred on the issue of class struggle in rural areas, especially on the issue of collectivization and rural political and legal work. The above-mentioned right-leaning conservative thoughts within the party have, to varying degrees and at different times, contributed to unhealthy trends, dampened healthy trends, and played a role in pouring cold water on the revolutionary vigor and creativity of the broad masses of cadres and the masses, greatly increasing the conservative tendency of the party's leading organs and the broad masses of cadres to be tied up, hesitant, and afraid to boldly advance and boldly create, and have once caused serious harm to the work. If these shortcomings are not reversed, the revolutionary enthusiasm of cadres and the masses cannot be mobilized. The Provincial Committee of Guangdong thoroughly criticized right-leaning conservative thoughts during this period, especially at this Party Congress, and made correct conclusions on the issues that have been debated over the years, and the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of cadres and the masses were immediately developed. The vigorous atmosphere of winter production and the successful convening of this Party Congress are clear evidence.

The meeting emphasized that over the past year or so, the localism that has grown up among a small number of cadres in the Guangdong Provincial Party organization has more seriously damaged the party's unity and the party's interests. They expressed doubts and opposition to the central government's policy of "relying on the large army, relying on the southward army, and the southward cadres taking the lead"; attacked the land reform and the previous political movements, attempting to overturn the verdicts; expressed distrust of the Provincial Committee's correct leadership; and slandered the Provincial Committee's cadre policy as having "sectarianism". The localism of a small number of local cadres on Hainan Island was even more serious. They used all means, regardless of whether they were inside or outside the party, to collude with each other, fabricate materials, and undermine the party's unity, damage party-mass relations, and harm army-civilian relations. A very small number of localist elements on Hainan Island even colluded with class enemies in Lingao County to make trouble, conspiring to usurp the leadership of the party and the government. Therefore, thoroughly overcoming localism is the urgent task of the current Guangdong Provincial Party organization. The anti-localism struggle within the Guangdong Provincial Party organization has had a good start. The Provincial Committee believes that it can be completely resolved in a short period of time. Comrade Tao Zhu said in his concluding speech to the congress that as long as right-leaning conservatism and localism are reversed, the work of Guangdong Province will immediately show a new atmosphere. If it is said that in the past two years, especially in the past year, because these two problems have not been resolved, the energy has not been able to be exerted, and the leadership energy has been dispersed, then now the problem has been solved or will be solved immediately, and in the future, all the energy will definitely be used for work. The Party organization of Guangdong Province has been energetic in its past work, and now it should be a time to exert its energy even more.

The Second Session of the First Congress of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee passed a resolution and, in accordance with the same spirit, made specific arrangements for the work of the mass rectification movement, streamlining institutions, and developing production in mountainous areas (including hilly areas).

　　彻底批判党内右倾思想和地方主义
    广东鼓起革命英雄主义干劲
    党代会上提出争取粮食千斤省的响亮口号
    新华社广州10日电　11月21日在广州开幕的中共广东省第一届代表大会第二次会议，已于5日闭幕。参加大会的代表六百四十三人，列席七百零三人，在大会上发言的有一百五十九人。会议认为，这是一个开得很好的革命促进会。大会反映了全省千百万人民群众革命热情的新的高涨。
    会议指出，一年多来极少见到的革命英雄主义干劲在这次大会上又出现了。这股干劲在大会讨论农业生产大跃进时，表现得特别明显。中共广东省委的许多原订计划指标一再被突破。省委原来对明年增产粮食二十亿斤还不是很有把握的，但大会肯定可以实现，决心以战斗的姿态做好明年春耕前的一切准备工作，一定要争取一个比前年还大得多的大丰收。省委原希望驻军能抽出二百万个劳动日支援今年冬季生产，但驻军保证能支援三百万个劳动日。为了迎接生产新高潮，省委原计划抽调十六万干部下乡上山，但大会却通过了下放十八万干部的决议。省委原订到1967年时，每亩粮食产量由今年的五百一十斤，提高到八百五十斤，但大会通过的却是九百斤，争取达到一千斤，提出争取“粮食千斤省”的口号。投资水利的款项，除中央投资的不计外，在本年度省里决定从原计划的五千万元增加到六千万元，各地从二千万元增加到四千万元，以上共达一亿元。（五年省与地方原来计划为四亿元，现增加到五亿元。）党代表大会在讨论和通过今年冬季生产计划、明年生产计划和十二年发展计划时，都能看到这股革命干劲。流行了一年，直到前个时期还能听到的没有动手便喊叫困难的声音，现在听不到了。整个大会表现出革命热情非常充沛。
    在这次大会上表现出来的革命干劲，还影响和造成了向先进看齐、重视先进、鄙视保守落后的空气。先进单位先进人物的先进指标，特别是他们增产的具体经验，在大会上普遍地受到尊敬和重视。新会、阳江、澄海、兴宁等县，尤其是海陵岛，不靠国家贷款，不靠化学肥料，只凭大家一双手，大规模兴修小型水利，得到高额增产的榜样，更为大家所看重。在大会上介绍先进经验的几十个代表的发言受到极大的欢迎，各代表团还用整个大会期间的三分之二的时间，去学习和研究先进的增产措施。这种学习，又反转来增强了各代表团的革命干劲，使干劲和增产的具体措施相结合。
    会议认为，在大会上，和革命干劲同时出现的，是在清算地方主义错误时表现了高度的原则性。广东省党组织内的地方主义错误，一年来严重地破坏了党的团结，损害了党的利益。大会上，各代表团坚决地支持了省委领导的反地方主义斗争，各代表团对地方主义作了严正的谴责，并作出了相应的决议。这都给省委以更大的决心和信心，迅速、彻底地肃清地方主义在党内的影响。
    会议指出，生产上的革命干劲，反地方主义上的高度原则性，在这次党代表大会上能集中地同时出现，绝不是偶然的现象。它反映了广东省广大人民群众的革命热情的新高潮。大会上的所有发言，都反映出经过农村社会主义教育运动、干部中的反右派斗争和党的八届三中全会决议的传达，广大人民群众，尤其广大贫苦农民群众和多数党员，产生了的一股建设社会主义的高度热情。目前的农村面貌和几个月以前相比较，已经焕然一新。社会主义教育运动前，广东省农民群众中坚决走社会主义道路的大约只有30％，动摇的40％到50％，要走资本主义道路的20％到30％。现在坚决走社会主义道路的已增加到70％到80％，动摇的还有20％左右，坚决要走资本主义道路的只有5％以下，并且很孤立了。广大农民群众不仅社会主义觉悟空前提高，而且发展生产，特别是发展集体生产，搞好基本建设的积极性空前的高涨。全省今年冬季生产指标一再层层突破，出勤率一般都达到90％以上。各地区代表的发言中，都有许多农民积极性远远超过社干部，社干部又远远超过县领导机关的生动事例。贫苦农民群众的劳动热情非常高，只要引导得当，一行动起来便突破了领导机关的冬季生产指标。在代表发言的材料中，就有几十个农业社完成的冬季生产实际数字超过县领导机关计划指标一倍、四倍甚至八九倍的例子。今年全省冬种面积比去年超过五百万亩的计划已接近完成（即冬种两千万亩的计划已完成一千九百万亩）。
    会议认为代表们向大会提出先进指标时，所以那么自信那么有把握，很显然是受了农村革命新高涨的强烈影响的。同样的，党代表大会能这么坚决地支持省委领导的反地方主义斗争，也正是代表们经过整风反右派，大大提高了共产主义觉悟的结果。大会能够开成革命促进会，组织生产表现了革命干劲，反地方主义表现了高度的原则性，还由于省委的领导在这个时期，特别是这次党代表大会上，彻底批判了党内领导思想上的右倾保守和地方主义的缘故。
    会议认为，近年来，广东省党组织内在对待许多问题上，特别在对待农村工作问题上，存在着一种右倾保守思想。党内有一部分人对党的领导作用，对集体农民的强大力量总是采取不信任态度。他们对农业生产的巨大成绩表示怀疑，对以粮食为主的农业生产方针表示反对，对合作化后全省农民进行农田基本建设和技术改革的革命精神表示非议，而一味夸大工作中的个别缺点。去年下半年，在正确地反对工作中的主观主义、官僚主义和强迫命令的同时，对保护干部和群众的革命积极性注意不够（去年8月召开的中共广东省第一届代表大会第一次会议就有这个缺点）。去年下半年以来，在农村的阶级斗争问题上，特别是在合作化问题和农村政法工作问题上，也曾经发生了严重的右倾思想。上述党内右倾保守思想，都在不同时期不同程度上助长了邪气，挫伤了正气；都对广大干部和群众的革命朝气与创造性，起了泼冷水的作用，大大增加了党的领导机关和广大干部束手束脚、畏首畏尾、不敢大胆前进大胆创造的保守倾向；都曾经对工作起了严重的危害作用。不把这些缺点反掉，干部和群众的革命干劲便不可能发动起来。广东省委在这个时期，特别是这次党代表大会上，彻底批判了右倾保守思想，对历来争论的问题作出了正确的结论，广大干部和群众的革命热情和创造性便立刻发扬起来了。冬季生产的蓬勃气象和这次党代表会开得成功就是明证。
    会议强调指出，一年多来，广东省党组织内少数干部中滋长起来的地方主义，更严重地损害了党的团结和党的利益。他们对中央的“依靠大军、依靠南下大军、南下干部挂帅”的方针表示怀疑与反对；对土改和历次政治运动进行攻击，企图翻案；对省委的正确领导表示不信任；污蔑省委的干部政策有“宗派主义”。海南岛少数地方干部的地方主义，更为严重，他们不择手段，不分党内外，互相串连，捏造材料，破坏党的团结，破坏党群关系和军民关系。海南岛极少数地方主义分子，竟在临高县和阶级敌人勾结起来闹事，阴谋篡夺党和政府的领导权。因此，彻底克服地方主义，是当前广东省党组织的迫切任务。广东省党组织内的反地方主义斗争，已经有了一个良好的开端。省委相信能在短期内彻底解决。陶铸同志作大会总结发言时说，只要反掉了右倾保守和地方主义，广东省的工作将立刻出现新气象。如果说两年来，特别是近一年来，因为这两个问题没有解决，劲头施展不出，领导精力分散，那么，现在问题已经解决或就要立刻解决了，今后就一定能将所有的劲头用之于工作。广东省党的组织，在过去的工作中是有干劲的，现在应该是更大的发挥干劲的时候了。
    中共广东省第一届代表大会第二次会议通过了决议，还根据同一精神，作出了关于全民整风运动、紧缩机构、开发山区（包括丘陵区）生产等工作的具体部署。
