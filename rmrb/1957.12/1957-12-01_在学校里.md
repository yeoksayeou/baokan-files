　　Learning Foreign Languages
　　The Foreign Language Teaching and Research Group of Fujian Agricultural College has been expanding foreign language teaching year by year with the rapid development of the country's scientific endeavors and the vigorous development of the college, and has provided many favorable conditions to ensure the gradual improvement of foreign language teaching quality and the foreign language proficiency of students. In addition to Russian and English, a German class has been added this academic year. Currently, there are 21 Russian classes, 7 English classes, and 7 German classes. Russian and English classes are also divided into "fast classes" and "regular classes" according to students' foreign language proficiency, with different teaching progress. In addition, to help teachers improve their skills in their spare time, the teachers' Russian intermediate class, English class, and German class have continued to be offered, connecting to the progress of the previous semester. This semester, an elementary Russian class for faculty and staff has been added, using the "Russian Textbook" compiled by Renmin University of China, starting with language instruction. The total number of people in the college participating in foreign language learning is 783, including 718 students, accounting for over 83% of the total number of students in the college, and 65 faculty and staff members (not including those who are self-studying foreign languages).
　　
　　Scientific Research Oriented Towards Production
　　Sichuan Agricultural College is actively carrying out its scientific research work this year. As of the beginning of this term, of the 104 research topics in the college (excluding "Mountainous Area Agricultural Research"), 12 have been completed and 64 are in progress, accounting for 73% of all topics. This year, a total of 128 teachers are participating in the research, an increase of 77% compared to last year, accounting for 61% of the total number of teachers.

　　In the process of carrying out scientific research work, many teachers are able to adhere to the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, running science diligently and thriftily, making full use of existing equipment, and exploiting the potential of existing materials, working hard. Many teachers have worked tirelessly in the areas near Ya'an, or traveled long distances across mountains and rivers during holidays to collect and investigate research materials in places such as Lixian, Emei, Erlangshan, and Luding.

　　Thanks to the efforts of the teachers, some topics have now completed the research plan for this year, and have achieved certain results in production, teaching, and science. For example, "Regional Identification of Improved Wheat Varieties" has preliminarily determined that planting 51-Mai and Shannong 205 in Ya'an increases production by about 20% compared to the originally promoted variety 2419. Research on the introduction and cultivation of Jatropha curcas from wild species has shown that the oil content of Jatropha curcas is over 48% after analysis, providing important data for solving the country's oil source problem. Other studies, such as rice research, cotton experiments, swine fever, and schistosomiasis, have yielded certain results and are continuing to be tested.

　　在学校里
    学习外国语
    福建农学院外国语教研组随着国家科学事业的突飞猛进，随着学院的蓬勃发展，逐年来扩大了外国语的教学，并为保证逐步提高外语教学质量，提高学生外语水平提供了很多有利的条件。本学年除俄、英语外，增开了德语班，现共开了俄语二十一班，英语七班，德语七班，俄、英语还按学生外语程度，分别编为“快班”、“普通班”两种不同进度上课。此外，为了帮助教工业余进修，除教师俄语中级班、英语班、德语班，都分别衔接上学期的进度继续开课外，本学期增设教职员俄语初级班，采用中国人民大学编的“俄语教科书”，从语言开始讲授。全院参加外语学习的人数，共达七百八十三人，内学生七百一十八人，占在校学生总人数83％强，教工六十五人（不包括自学进修外语的人数）。
    科学研究面向生产
    四川农学院本年度的科学研究工作正积极开展中。迄至本期开学为止，全院一百零四个科研题目中（不包括“山区农业研究”）已经完成的有十二个，正在进行的有六十四个，共占全部题目的73％。今年参加研究的教师共一百二十八人，比去年增加了77％，为全体教师总人数的61％。
    在开展科学研究工作的过程中，不少教师都能本着增产节约，勤俭办科学的精神，尽量利用原有设备，发挥现有物资潜力，艰苦工作。许多教师都不辞辛苦地在雅安附近地区，或利用假期远道跋山涉水去理县、峨嵋、二郎山、泸定等地采集调查研究资料。
    由于教师们的努力，现在有的题目已完成了本年的研究计划，并在生产、教学和科学上取得了一定的成果。如“小麦良种区域鉴定”，已初步确定了雅安种植51麦、山农205比原来推广种2419增产20％左右。从野生种引栽的续随子的研究，经分析续随子含油量达48％以上，为解决国家的油源问题，提供了重要资料。其他如水稻研究、棉花试验、猪瘟喘气病、血吸虫病等的研究，都得到了一定的结果，并正在继续进行试验。
