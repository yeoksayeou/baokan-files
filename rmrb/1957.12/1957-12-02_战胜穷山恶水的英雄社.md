    Heroic Cooperative Defeats Barren Mountains and Rivers

    The Dashan Agricultural Cooperative is located in Lijiachaizhai Township, Yingnan County, Shandong, an old revolutionary base area. Because the territory is full of mountains and ridges, the cooperative's more than 6,000 mu of land is divided into small pieces. Among the relatively flat 1,000-plus mu of land, all are covered with stone slag, and the topsoil is only two or three inches thick. Each mu yielded only forty or fifty jin of wheat. Before liberation, more than seventy households in the township begged for food year-round. Local farmers described their lives as "poor people's three sticks - first herding sheep, then herding cattle, and then begging with sticks for a few years."

    After liberation, the farmers of Lijiachaizhai Township organized themselves and, under the slogan "Cut down ridges and fill in gullies, change the course of the river, and turn the land over," they leveled eleven ridges, filled in twenty-one large pits and three hundred water gullies, and consolidated more than one thousand scattered plots of land into more than one hundred large plots, expanding the cultivated land by 192 mu. They also carried out soil and water conservation work, taming the fierce mountain floods. In 1953, the average yield of grain per mu was 590 jin; 1956 was a year of rare major disasters, but the average yield per mu was still more than 550 jin. 60% of the cooperative members have reached the living standards of prosperous middle peasants.　　　　　　　(Xinhua News Agency manuscript) (Attached pictures)
　　1. Years of closing hillsides for afforestation have protected the land on both sides of the Dashan River from further erosion.
　　2. The cooperative has built thirteen reservoirs. This is a corner of the Dashan Reservoir on the north mountain.
    3. The cooperative built five irrigation ditches and underground waterways to bring the clear water of the Dashan River to the top of the ridge. This is a cooperative member using a waterwheel on the ridge to irrigate the land.
    4. Cooperative member Elder Ren Ping grew such a big radish for the first time in his life.

    战胜穷山恶水的英雄社
    大山农业社位于老革命根据地山东营南县厉家寨乡，由于境内山岭纵横，全社六千多亩土地被分割成瓢一块，碗一块。其中比较平展的一千多亩地，也都布满了石渣子，土层只有二、三寸，每亩地仅收麦子四、五十斤。解放前，全乡有七十多户常年讨饭。当地农民形容自己的生活是“穷人三根棍——先放羊，后放牛，再拉几年要饭棍”。
    解放后，厉家寨乡的农民组织了起来，在“劈岭填沟，让河水改道，叫土地翻身”的口号下，移平了十一个岭头，填平了二十一个大坑和三百多道水沟，把一千多块零碎土地整理成一百多块大片地，并扩大耕地一百九十二亩。又进行了水土保持工作，把凶猛的山洪驯服了。1953年平均亩产粮食五百九十斤；1956年是历史上少有的大灾年，平均每亩仍产粮五百五十多斤。全社已有60％的社员生活水平赶上了富裕中农。　　　　　　　刘正中摄（新华社稿）（附图片）
　　1、几年来的封山造林，保护了大山河两岸土地不再流失。
　　2、全社修了十三个水库。这是北山上大水库的一角。
    3、社里修了五道引水沟和地下水道，把大山河的清水引上岭头。这是社员在岭上车水浇地。
    4、社员任平老大爷有生以来第一次种出这样大的萝卜。
