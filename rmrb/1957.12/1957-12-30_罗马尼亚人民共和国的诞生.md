    The Birth of the People's Republic of Romania

    Ten years ago today, the liberated Romanian people overthrew the monarchy and declared Romania a People's Republic. From then on, the eighty-year rule of the Hohenzollern dynasty in Romania ended with the abdication of the last king, Michael; the people took control of all political power and struggled to realize the tasks of the second stage of the people's democratic revolution—the socialist revolution stage.

    The establishment of the first People's Republic in Romanian history is the brilliant achievement of the Romanian people's resolute struggle under the leadership of the working-class party. However, this qualitative change in the nature of political power was not accomplished through a revolutionary outbreak, but by the state apparatus itself on the basis of the victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution.

    To explain the characteristics of this revolutionary transformation, it is necessary to review the arduous struggle of the Romanian people in the first stage of the people's democratic revolution, namely the bourgeois democratic revolution stage.

    Before World War II, Romania was a constitutional monarchy. After 1940, when King Michael was in power, actual power fell into the hands of fascist soldiers, whose leader, Antonescu, became the head of state. The Antonescu regime violated national interests, brought Romania into the German fascist war against the Soviet Union, and brought profound disasters to the people.

    On August 23, 1944, inspired by the victorious advance of the Soviet army against German fascism, the Romanian people, under the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party (now the Workers' Party), launched an armed uprising, overthrew the Antonescu fascist dictatorship, and liberated Romania. However, in the early days of liberation, domestic reactionary forces were still quite strong, and bourgeois reactionaries still occupied many important positions in the government. The domestic economic structure had not undergone essential changes.

    In the early post-war period, the working masses, under the leadership of the Communist Party, established a broad united front and carried out a struggle to achieve democratic reforms and establish a truly democratic government. In the spring of 1945, the people's struggle finally achieved victory. On March 6, a democratic government headed by Dr. Petru Groza was formed by representatives of various parties and groups participating in the National Democratic Front.

    The National Democratic Front government had a solid democratic foundation and further developed the struggle against feudalism and imperialism. It implemented important democratic measures such as land reform, which were supported by the broad masses of the people. The parliamentary elections on November 19, 1946, further eliminated the influence of the reactionaries in the country's political life. With the domestic situation deteriorating rapidly, the people of the whole country unanimously demanded the abolition of the monarchy and the path to socialism. On December 30, 1947, King Michael finally signed the abdication decree. From then on, the last and largest pillar of the Romanian reactionary forces collapsed, and the People's Republic of Romania was born.

    On April 13, 1948, the first constitution of the People's Republic of Romania was adopted, summarizing the great achievements made by the Romanian people in the first stage of the revolution, and consolidating the people's democratic system established in Romania. The new constitution adopted on September 24, 1952 (the current constitution), marked the further development and consolidation of the Romanian people's democratic system.

    In the ten years since the establishment of the People's Republic of Romania, great progress has been made in politics, economy, and culture. Romania has transformed from a backward agricultural country into an industrial country with advanced agriculture and plays an important role in international life. Under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, the Romanian people are resolutely advancing along the road of building socialism and defending world peace.

    罗马尼亚人民共和国的诞生
    十年前的今天，解放了的罗马尼亚人民推翻了君主制度，宣布罗马尼亚为人民共和国。从此，霍享索伦王朝在罗马尼亚八十多年的统治，以末代国王米海依的退位而告终；人民掌握了全部政权，为实现人民民主革命第二阶段——社会主义革命阶段的任务而斗争。
    罗马尼亚历史上第一个人民共和国的成立，是罗马尼亚人民在工人阶级政党的领导下进行坚决斗争的光辉成果。但是，政权内容的这种质的变化不是通过革命爆发的形式，而是在资产阶级民主革命胜利的基础上由国家机构本身来完成的。
    为了说明这一革命变革的特点，需要回顾一下罗马尼亚人民在人民民主革命第一阶段，即资产阶级民主革命阶段的艰苦斗争。
    第二次世界大战以前，罗马尼亚是个君主立宪国家。1940年以后国王米海依在位时，实际政权落到法西斯军人手中，这些军人的首领安东尼斯库成了国家元首。安东尼斯库政权违背民族利益，使罗马尼亚参加了德国法西斯的反苏战争，给人民带来了深重的灾难。
    1944年8月23日，在苏联军队对德国法西斯胜利进军的鼓舞下，罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚共产党（即现在的工人党）的领导下，举行武装起义，推翻了安东尼斯库的法西斯独裁政权，使罗马尼亚获得了解放。但在解放初期，国内反动势力还相当强大，资产阶级反动派在政府中还窃据着许多重要的职位。国内经济结构也未发生本质上的变化。
    在战后初期，劳动群众在共产党领导下，建立了广泛的统一战线，进行了要求实现民主改革和建立真正民主政府的斗争。1945年春，人民的斗争终于获得胜利，3月6日，由参加民族民主阵线的各政党和团体的代表组成了以彼特鲁·格罗查博士为首的民主政府。
    民族民主阵线政府具有牢固的民主基础，进一步发展了反封建、反帝国主义的斗争。它实行了土地改革等重要的民主措施，受到了广大人民的拥护。1946年11月19日的议会选举进一步清除了反动派在国家政治生活中的势力和影响。在国内形势急转直下的情况下，全国人民一致要求废除君主制度，走社会主义的道路。1947年12月30日，国王米海依终于签署了退位诏书。从此，罗马尼亚反动势力的最后和最大的一个支柱崩溃了，罗马尼亚人民共和国诞生了。
    1948年4月13日，通过了罗马尼亚人民共和国的第一部宪法，总结了罗马尼亚人民在革命第一阶段所取得的伟大成就，巩固了在罗马尼亚建立的人民民主制度。1952年9月24日通过的新宪法（现行宪法），标志着罗马尼亚人民民主制度的进一步发展和巩固。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国成立十年来，在政治、经济和文化各方面都取得了巨大的进展。罗马尼亚已从一个落后的农业国变成拥有先进农
    业的工业国，在国际生活中起着重要作用。罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚工人党的领导下，坚决地沿着建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的道路前进。
