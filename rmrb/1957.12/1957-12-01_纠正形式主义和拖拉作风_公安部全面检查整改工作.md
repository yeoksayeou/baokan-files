    Correcting Formalism and Procrastination
　　Ministry of Public Security Conducts Comprehensive Inspection and Rectification Work
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch—To consolidate the achievements of the rectification work and to do the rectification work more effectively, all units under the Ministry of Public Security recently conducted a comprehensive inspection of this work.

    The Ministry of Public Security's inspection of the rectification work was mainly conducted at the enlarged meetings of the rectification leadership groups of its subordinate units. At the meetings, the handling of mass opinions and whether the corrections were thorough were checked item by item. Problems that were discovered were promptly criticized and corrected. The results of the inspection show that the rectification work of the Ministry of Public Security is basically normal. In the month after entering the third stage of the rectification campaign, the masses raised more than 4,900 criticisms and questions. Most of the problems that could be solved immediately were solved. Those that could not be solved immediately were also explained, and had already been included in special issues organized for mass discussion.

    Through this inspection, it was also found that some units had a procrastinating work style in the rectification, which resulted in some problems that could have been solved immediately not being solved in time. For example, cadres of the Tenth Bureau criticized the backlog of circulated documents during the "blooming and contending" period. The bureau's rectification leadership group accepted this opinion and decided that the bureau office should propose an improvement plan before November 4th. However, when inspected on the 13th, it was found that the office was dragging its feet and had not yet formulated a plan. The inspection also found that a few units only paid attention to ensuring that "every item was accounted for" in response to the opinions raised by the masses, but did not pay enough attention to whether the corrections were thorough. For example, when a unit transferred cadres to study, the masses requested in big-character posters that the cadres being transferred should complete the handover procedures before leaving their work. The rectification group of this unit thought the opinion was very good, and immediately urged the transferred cadres to complete the handover. However, in reality, the handover work was not done thoroughly, and the leadership did not check it in time. As a result, some materials urgently needed for work were not handed over, and the cadres had already left.

    The inspection also found that some units, when dealing with mass opinions, only vaguely expressed acceptance, without specific measures, and without designating specific personnel to be responsible, which affected the timely improvement of work. Cadres in one unit criticized the infrequent Party Day activities. The rectification group of this unit, in its reply, only said vaguely that "each branch should pay attention," without proposing specific opinions. This way of solving problems was actually equivalent to not solving them, and the masses had opinions. Recently, some cadres in this department have criticized the leadership for not focusing on professional study and hope that the leadership will seriously improve this. The leaders of the various units accepted everyone's opinions, but most of the units did not formulate specific measures. The cadres again expressed their hope that the leadership would seriously formulate specific measures and have long-term plans. It was only after two criticisms that this attracted attention. Now, the leadership of the Ministry of Public Security is formulating new plans based on the opinions of the masses.

    The inspection also found that although specific improvement plans were proposed for some problems, some units did not implement them effectively.

    Through repeated inspections, the leadership of each unit has grasped the rectification work more tightly than in the past. Many units have re-proposed improved methods for some problems. In the past, some units only paid attention to giving one answer for each opinion when dealing with mass opinions, or solving problems on a case-by-case basis. Now they have begun to conduct comprehensive research work to find the fundamental problems and solve them thoroughly, and pay attention to conducting ideological education for the masses in combination with rectification. In addition, the leadership of each unit has also strengthened the supervision and inspection of daily rectification work. Some units have established a card system to record the content of the opinions raised by the masses, the handling situation, and the handling date, which is convenient for supervision and inspection. The units of the Ministry of Public Security will announce the results of this inspection to the masses for everyone to supervise the rectification work. The Ministry of Public Security's inspection of the rectification work was conducted after the transition from general "blooming and contending" to topical "blooming and contending." It is planned to conduct a review of the rectification work after the topical "blooming and contending" has been carried out for a certain period.

    纠正形式主义和拖拉作风
　　公安部全面检查整改工作
    新华社讯　公安部所属各单位为了巩固整改工作的成果和更加切实做好整改工作，最近对这项工作进行了全面检查。
    公安部这次对整改工作的检查主要是在所属各单位整风领导小组扩大会上进行的。会上逐条检查了对群众意见的处理情况和改得是否彻底等问题。发现了问题都及时批评纠正。检查的结果，表明公安部的整改工作情况基本上是正常的。公安部在转入整风第三阶段后的一个月中，群众共提出四千九百多条批评意见和问题。能够马上改的问题绝大部分改了。不能够马上改的问题，也作了交代，并已列入专门问题组织群众讨论。
    通过这次检查，还发现有的单位在整改中有拖拉作风，结果使一些本来可以马上解决的问题没有及时解决。如十局的干部在鸣放中批评对传阅文件有积压的情况，局的整风领导小组接受了这个意见，并决定由局办公室在11月4日以前提出改进方案，可是在13日检查时，发现办公室拖拖拉拉还没有订出方案。在检查中还发现有少数单位只注意对群众提出的意见做到“件件有交代”，而对改的是否彻底却注意不够。如有一个单位调干部去学习时，群众在大字报上要求调去学习的干部在离开工作以前应把移交手续办理清楚，这个单位的整改小组认为意见很好，即督促调走的干部办理移交，可是在实际上移交工作做得不彻底，而领导上也没有及时检查，结果是一些工作上急用的材料没有移交，而干部已走了。
    在检查中还发现有的单位在处理群众意见时，只是笼统地表示接受，没有具体办法，也没有指定专人负责，以至影响及时地改进工作。有一个单位的干部对党日活动不经常提出批评意见。这个单位的整改小组在答复时，只是不痛不痒地说要“各支部注意”，没有提出具体意见，这种解决问题的办法实际上等于没有解决，群众是有意见的。最近这个部有些干部对领导上没有抓紧业务学习有意见，希望领导上认真加以改进，各单位领导上接受了大家的意见，但是大多数单位没有订出具体办法，干部们又提出意见，希望领导上切切实实订出具体办法，并要有长远计划。经过两次的批评，这才引起了重视。现在公安部领导方面正根据群众意见拟定新的计划。
    在检查中还发现有些问题虽然提出了具体改进方案，但是有些单位没有切实执行。
    通过反复检查，各单位领导方面对整改工作比过去抓得更紧。有许多单位对有些问题重新提出了改进的办法。过去有些单位在处理群众意见时只注意有一条答复一条，或者就问题解决问题，现在开始进行综合研究工作，找出根本的问题加以彻底解决，并注意在整改中结合对群众进行思想教育。另外，各单位领导上还加强了对日常整改工作的督促检查，有的单位建立了卡片制，纪录群众提出的意见内容、处理情况和处理日期等，这样便于督促检查。公安部各单位将要把这次检查结果向群众公布，让大家监督整改工作。公安部这次对整改工作的检查是在由一般鸣放转入专题鸣放后进行的。计划在专题鸣放到一定时期以后，再对整改工作进行复查。
