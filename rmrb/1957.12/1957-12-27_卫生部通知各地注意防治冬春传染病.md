The Ministry of Health issued a circular recently, requiring all provinces (autonomous regions) and cities to strengthen the prevention and control of infectious diseases in winter and spring.

The circular first pointed out: Recently, scarlet fever has been prevalent in Beijing and Tianjin. It is estimated that scarlet fever will have a major epidemic trend in various regions. Influenza may also re-emerge nationwide this winter and spring. Other diseases such as measles and epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis are also entering their peak seasons. Therefore, all local health departments are required to make specific arrangements in light of local conditions.

    I. Scarlet fever patients should be hospitalized and isolated for treatment as much as possible, and disinfection work should be done well; in rural areas where there are no hospitals, home isolation must also be achieved.
    II. In order to prevent the spread of influenza, if patients are found in large collective units, they should be immediately isolated for treatment. For sporadic patients in general residential areas, they may be required to isolate at home or wear masks to reduce the chance of transmission. Large gatherings should be restricted during widespread epidemics.
    III. Measles patients are generally isolated at home. Where conditions permit, community medical personnel should be organized to treat patients at home and strengthen nursing care.
    IV. In the case of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, isolation treatment should be strengthened when patients are found.
    V. In terms of smallpox prevention and treatment, areas where smallpox still occurs in a few places should carry out universal vaccination. In areas where it has generally been eliminated, the work of vaccinating at the prescribed age should be implemented.
    VI. All regions are required to strengthen epidemic reporting and conduct publicity and education in conjunction with the winter patriotic health campaign.

    卫生部通知各地注意防治冬春传染病
    本报讯　卫生部在最近发出通报，要求各省（自治区）市加强冬春季节传染病的防治工作。
    通报首先指出：近来在北京、天津二市猩红热流行，据估计：猩红热在各地将有大流行的趋势。流行性感冒今冬明春在全国各地也有再度流行的可能。其他如麻疹、流行性脑脊髓膜炎等亦到开始多发的季节。因此，要求各地卫生部门结合当地情况进行具体布置。
    一、对猩红热病人应尽可能入院隔离治疗，作好消毒工作；在没有医院的农村，亦要作到家庭隔离。
    二、为了预防流行性感冒的传扩，在大的集体单位发现病人后，应该立即进行隔离治疗，对一般居民区中散发的病人，可以要求他们在家隔离或带口罩，以减少传播机会。在广泛流行的时候，要限制大型集会。
    三、麻疹病人一般在家隔离。有条件的地方组织地段医务人员到病家治疗，加强护理。
    四、对流行性脑脊髓膜炎在发现病人时，要加强隔离治疗。
    五、在天花防治方面，少数仍有天花发生的地区，要进行普种牛痘，一般已经消灭的地区，应贯彻按规定年龄种痘的工作。
    六、要求各地加强疫情报告，并结合冬季爱国卫生运动进行宣传教育。
