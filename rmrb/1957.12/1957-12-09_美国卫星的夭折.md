Title: The Abortion of the American Satellite

The United States boasted the most and the earliest about launching satellites. Before the carrier rocket was even built, it was given the name "Vanguard," but it failed to launch time and time again. No wonder some people mocked it and said it should be called "Latecomer" (note). It is said that the American satellite failed to fly several times because the wind was too strong. This reason is not surprising. That bullet is so light and so small, wouldn't even a little wind blow it away? Finally, on a day when the wind was calm and the sun was shining, the little thing weighing four pounds finally left the ground, but unfortunately, it fell after only a few feet, making the gentlemen in Washington crestfallen. This kind of thing is certainly not glorious, because they made a complete fool of themselves in front of everyone. However, the president, who has just recovered from illness, doesn't need to blush. Just brag less about "advanced," "strength," and "powerful" in the future.
    Note: According to a Reuters dispatch from Bonn, "The American satellite already has a nickname in West Germany, 'Spätnik.' The word 'Spät' in German means 'late.'" (Attached image)

　　美国卫星的夭折
    池北偶发射卫星数美国吹嘘得最多最早，运载火箭还未造好先起了个名字“先锋号”，就是三番四次都发射不起来，难怪有人挖苦它应该叫做“迟到”（注）。据说美国卫星几次飞不起是因为风太大，这个理由说来也并不奇怪，那颗弹丸是这末轻又这末小，可不是大一点的风都会把它刮坏？总算找到了一个风和日畅的日子，四磅来重的小东西终于离开了地，可惜还到不了几英尺高就坠落了，弄得华盛顿的老爷们一个个垂头丧气。这种事情当然很不光采，因为在大伙儿面前出尽了丑态，不过刚刚病好的总统也用不着脸红，只要以后少吹什么“先进”、“实力”和“强大”。
    注：据路透社从波恩发出的电讯说，“美国卫星在西德已经有了一个绰号‘斯佩特尼克’。‘斯佩特’一字在德文中意为‘迟到’”。（附图片）
