Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 11th. On the eve of the 30th anniversary of the Guangzhou Uprising on December 11th, the "Guangzhou Daily" published an article from December 1st to 4th written by the Propaganda Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, entitled "The Guangzhou Uprising," providing a brief introduction to the Guangzhou Uprising. The article states that in order to salvage the achievements of the Great Revolution of 1924-1927 and to resist the counter-revolutionary massacre by the Kuomintang reactionaries, on December 11, 1927, Guangzhou workers, revolutionary soldiers, and other revolutionary masses, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, following the Nanchang Uprising and the Autumn Harvest Uprising, held the famous Guangzhou Uprising. At the beginning of the uprising, the Guangzhou Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government was established, and a revolutionary program was put forward. Counter-revolutionary forces, supported by imperialism, jointly counterattacked, and due to the disparity in strength between the enemy and ourselves, the uprising unfortunately failed on December 13th. From the beginning to the failure of the uprising, the brave Guangzhou workers and other revolutionary masses fought bloody battles with the counter-revolutionary forces for three consecutive days.

The article, after detailing the heroic struggles and achievements of the Guangdong working class during the revolutionary period of 1924 to 1927, said that just as the Northern Expedition was developing rapidly, Chiang Kai-shek, under the instructions of imperialism, launched a counter-revolutionary coup in Shanghai on April 12, 1927, massacring a large number of workers and Communists, and declared anti-communism. Following Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal, the counter-revolutionary faction in Guangdong also carried out a counter-revolutionary coup in Guangzhou on April 15th. In order to resist the counter-revolutionary terror of the betraying Kuomintang and to repel the rampant attacks of the big bourgeoisie, landlords, and their followers against the workers, the revolutionary workers of Guangzhou put forward the demand for an armed uprising.

After the Wuhan Kuomintang's anti-communism in July 1927, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an emergency meeting on August 7th. At this meeting, in order to save the revolution, the Party determined the general policy of armed resistance to the Kuomintang reactionaries' policy of massacre. On November 17, 1927, the Party Central Committee instructed the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to launch and expand armed uprisings in cities and villages to establish a workers' and peasants' democratic government. On November 26th, the Guangdong Provincial Committee passed a resolution to launch an armed uprising in Guangzhou, and on the 28th, it issued a public declaration calling for an uprising, actively supporting and leading the heroic demands and actions of the Guangzhou working class. After the Guangdong Provincial Committee decided to hold an uprising in Guangzhou, it immediately established a general headquarters to lead the uprising, with Comrade Zhang Tailei, a member of the Central Committee and Secretary of the Provincial Committee, as the general commander.

Soon, the scattered secret armed organizations of Guangzhou workers, such as the "Workers' Self-Rescue Team," the "Jianzi Team," and the "Hong Kong-Guangdong Strike Workers' Interests Maintenance Team," were reorganized into a unified leadership of the Red Guards. The uprising was originally scheduled for December 13th. However, Wang Jingwei, who was in Shanghai at the time, heard about the Guangzhou workers' preparations for an uprising and immediately made emergency arrangements. Under these urgent circumstances, the general headquarters of the uprising decided to advance the time to December 11th.

At 3:30 a.m. on December 11, 1927, on a night with a few stars, the Guangzhou working class and revolutionary soldiers held a heroic armed uprising. The uprising started from the Training Regiment, and soldiers from the Garrison Regiment also participated. Due to the bravery and decisiveness of the uprising masses and the rapid mobilization of the uprising troops, most of the city was occupied within two hours. The white terror of Guangzhou was transformed into a red revolutionary Guangzhou! With the victory of the armed uprising, at 6:00 a.m. on the 11th, the Guangzhou Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government (the regime known as the "Guangzhou Commune") was immediately established. As soon as the Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government was established, it immediately issued a declaration to the workers, peasants, and soldiers throughout the country and the proletariat of the world.

Workers throughout the city and some young students joined the uprising. By dawn, the number of participants had reached more than 20,000. From the evening of the 11th, thousands of armed workers and uprising soldiers, on the one hand, continued to mop up the remaining enemies and attack enemy strongholds that had not been captured, such as the headquarters of the Fourth Army; on the other hand, they cracked down on various counter-revolutionary forces supporting the remnants of the enemy in Hebei.

On the second day of the uprising—December 12th—the various counter-revolutionary forces (imperialist armies and navies, and the various warlord factions that originally hated each other—Zhang Fakui, Li Fulin, Xue Yue, etc.) were shocked by the victory of the workers', peasants', and soldiers' uprising and had united to desperately counterattack the revolutionary city of Guangzhou. On that day, 2,000 British troops, 400 French sailors, and more than 300 Japanese sailors were deployed in Shamian, while warships from the United States, Britain, France, and Japan patrolled the Pearl River to demonstrate against the uprising troops. Japanese warships even fired at the uprising troops. At this time, the armed forces of the uprising began to face serious difficulties.

At 2:00 p.m. on the 12th, Comrade Zhang Tailei attended the Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Congress in Xiguayuan and was attacked by a team of enemy soldiers who rushed from Dabeimen while returning to the general headquarters of the uprising by car, and unfortunately died in the shooting. The death of Comrade Zhang Tailei deprived the overall military situation of its leadership center. Although the enemy repeatedly counterattacked unsuccessfully that day, their reinforcements from various places were summoned one after another and continued to increase. Although the uprising troops fought fiercely all day long, they were surrounded by enemies on all sides by night.

Under this extremely unfavorable situation, in order to preserve the revolutionary armed forces, the general headquarters of the uprising decided that the main force of the uprising armed forces would withdraw to Dongshan in batches after 10:00 p.m. that night. After the main force of the uprising armed forces withdrew, the Red Guards and other uprising masses who remained in the city fought a desperate battle with the counter-revolutionary forces on their own.

On the third day of the uprising, December 13th, a large number of counter-revolutionary reinforcements arrived one after another, launching a large-scale counterattack on the revolutionary city of Guangzhou from all directions. At this time, some of the Red Guards and revolutionary workers and masses who had not withdrawn from Guangzhou, although in a situation where the enemy was numerous and we were few and the strength was disparate, still resolutely fought back in various ways. At this point, the vigorous Guangzhou armed uprising and the Guangzhou Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government, which had only been established for three days, suffered defeat under the joint attack of various counter-revolutionary armed forces several times larger than itself. The people of Guangzhou once again fell into the dark abyss of counter-revolutionary terror.

The counter-revolutionary forces reoccupied Guangzhou and immediately carried out an extremely barbaric massacre of the people of Guangzhou. According to the Kuomintang reactionaries themselves, the number of Communists and revolutionary masses who died in the few days after the failure of the uprising reached 5,700. In this counter-revolutionary massacre, the Soviet Consulate in Guangzhou, which had always been regarded as a thorn in the side by the imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries, was also attacked by counter-revolutionary troops. The Soviet Deputy Consul in Guangzhou and many other consulate staff members were also arrested and publicly shot on trumped-up charges related to the uprising. At that time, corpses were scattered everywhere in the streets and alleys, and the flesh and blood were blurred. Even those with a little conscience could not bear to witness it. The entire city of Guangzhou became a sea of blood for the working people. In this way, the martyrs of the Guangzhou Uprising used their blood to write a very magnificent and moving chapter in the history of the Chinese revolution, worthy of singing and weeping.

The article concludes by pointing out that the Guangzhou Uprising itself failed, but it did not completely fail. A part of the uprising troops transferred to the countryside to help and develop the peasant revolution. The Guangzhou Uprising and the facts after its failure once again proved that the working class must form a close alliance with the peasants. Without the active participation of the peasants and without a broad peasant revolution, it is impossible to achieve the victory of the Chinese revolution.

The Guangzhou Uprising was held under the situation of the failure of the Chinese revolution. At that time, in the face of the enemy's attack, "the entire Party organization needed a correct retreat, not a continued offensive; local armed struggles could only temporarily become a special form of defense." (Hu Qiaomu: Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China) Therefore, at that time, the "Guangzhou Uprising," which was carried out under the situation of the low tide of the Chinese revolution and the enemy's strength and our weakness, although the insurgents were unprecedentedly brave and resolute in their struggle, the result of long-term occupation of a large city like Guangzhou could not but fall into failure. The Guangzhou Uprising and its failure once again proved the long-term and cruel nature of the Chinese revolution; proved that the main form of the Chinese democratic revolution cannot take a peaceful form, but must be armed struggle; and proved that the Chinese revolution must first establish base areas in the countryside.

The Guangzhou Uprising is now thirty years old. Today's China is already a socialist China, but the fighting spirit of the heroes who participated in the Guangzhou Uprising thirty years ago and the heroic deeds of the dead martyrs still encourage the people of Guangzhou and the Chinese people, who are building a socialist motherland and safeguarding world peace, to advance victoriously.

The great deeds of the Guangzhou Uprising and the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the uprising will be immortal!

　　广州起义简况
    新华社广州11日电　在12月11日广州起义三十周年纪念前夕，“广州日报”从12月1日到4日连续刊载了中共广东省委宣传部编写的题为“广州起义”的文章，对广州起义作了扼要的介绍。文章说，为了挽救1924年至1927年大革命的成果，武装反抗国民党反动派的反革命屠杀，1927年12月11日，广州工人、革命士兵和其他革命群众，在中国共产党领导下，继南昌起义和秋收起义之后，举行了有名的广州起义。起义开始便建立了广州工农民主政权，提出了革命的政纲。反革命力量在帝国主义支持下联合反扑，由于敌我力量悬殊，到12月13日，起义便不幸失败了。从起义开始到失败，英勇起义的广州工人和其他革命群众与反革命势力一连血战了三天。
    文章在详细叙述了广东工人阶级在1924年至1927年的革命时期中进行英勇斗争及其成果后说，正当北伐战争迅速发展的紧要关头，蒋介石在帝国主义的指示之下，1927年4月12日在上海举行了反革命的政变，屠杀了大批的工人和共产党员，宣布了反共。继蒋介石叛变之后，4月15日广东的反革命派也在广州进行了反革命的政变。为了反抗叛变的国民党的反革命恐怖，打退大资产阶级、地主及其追随者向工人的猖狂进攻，广州的革命工人们提出了武装起义的要求。
    中国共产党中央在1927年7月武汉国民党反共以后，就在8月7日召集了紧急会议，党在这个会议上为了挽救革命，确定了武装反抗国民党反动派屠杀政策的总方针。党中央在1927年11月17日便指示中共广东省委要在城市和农村中发动和扩大武装起义，建立工农民主政权。11月26日广东省委通过了在广州发动武装起义的决定，并在28日发表了公开号召起义的宣言，积极支持和领导了广州工人阶级这一英勇的要求和行动。广东省委决定在广州举行起义之后，立即成立领导起义的总指挥部，由中央委员、省委书记张太雷同志担任总指挥。
    很快，广州各业工人分散的秘密武装组织“工人自救队”，“剑仔队”和“省港罢工工人利益维持队”等，改编为统一领导的赤卫队。起义的时间原定在12月13日。但是，当时在上海的汪精卫风闻广州工人准备起义的消息，立即作了紧急的部署。在这种紧急情况下，起义总指挥部便决定把时间提前在12月11日。
    1927年12月11日上午三时三十分，那是一个月明星稀的夜晚，广州的工人阶级和革命士兵举行了英勇的武装起义。起义是从教导团开始，警卫团的士兵也参加了起义。由于起义群众的英勇果敢和起义队伍的调动迅速，两小时后，即占领了全城大部分地区。白色恐怖的广州变成红色的革命的广州了！随着武装起义的胜利，11日上午六时，广州工农民主政府（即被称为“广州公社”的政权）马上建立起来了。工农民主政府一经成立，便立即发布告全国工农兵群众以及全世界无产阶级的宣言。
    全市工人和一部分青年学生纷纷参加起义。天亮以后，参加人数已达二万余人。从11日晚上起，几千个武装的工人和起义士兵，一方面继续扫荡残敌，进攻第四军军部等未攻下的敌军据点；一方面则打击反革命各种力量对河北残敌的支援。
    起义的第二天——12月12日，反革命的各种力量（帝国主义海陆军，原来互相仇视的各派军阀——张发奎、李福林、薛岳等）震惊于工农兵起义的胜利，已经联合起来，拼命的向革命的广州市实行反扑。当天，英国军队二千名、法国水兵四百名和日本水兵三百余名，在沙面布防，而美、英、法、日各国军舰则游弋珠江江上向起义队伍示威。日本军舰更向起义队伍射击。这个时候，起义的武装力量便开始处在严重困难的境地。
    12日下午二时，张太雷同志出席西瓜园工农兵大会后，乘车返起义总指挥部，受到从大北门窜来一队敌兵的袭击，不幸中弹牺牲。张太雷同志之死使全盘军事失却领导中心。当天敌军虽屡次反扑不成，但他们的各地援兵纷纷应调而来，有增无已，起义队伍虽拚死竟日激战，到当天夜间已经四面受敌。
    在这种十分不利的形势下，为了保存革命武装力量，起义总指挥部当天晚上决定起义武装的主力十时后分批向东山方面撤退。自起义武装的主力撤走后，留在市内的赤卫队与其他起义群众便单独和反革命势力作殊死战。
    起义的第三天，12月13日，反革命的大批援军纷纷到达，从四方八面向革命的广州市大举反扑。这时未曾退出广州的一部分赤卫队和革命工人群众虽已处于敌众我寡、力量悬殊的局面，仍坚决分途应战。至此，轰轰烈烈的广州武装起义和建立只有三天的广州工农民主政权，就在数倍于己的各种反革命武装力量的联合进攻下遭受失败。广州人民又重新堕入反革命恐怖的暗无天日的深渊里了。
    反革命势力重占广州，立即就对广州人民进行了极端野蛮的屠杀。据国民党反动派自己承认，仅在起义失败后几天中，共产党员和革命群众死难者便达到五千七百人。在这次反革命大屠杀中，一向被帝国主义和国民党反动派视为眼中钉的苏联驻广州领事馆也受到反革命军队的袭击，苏联驻广州副领事和其他馆员多人，也被强加以同起义有关的莫须有的罪名而逮捕起来并公开枪杀。当时，大街小巷到处尸体纵横，血肉模糊，稍有良心者也目不忍睹，广州全市竟变成劳动人民的血海了。就这样，广州起义的烈士们，用自己的鲜血替中国革命史写上了非常壮烈动人，可歌可泣的一章。
    文章最后指出，广州起义本身是失败了，但没有完全失败，起义队伍的一部分转移到农村里去，帮助和发展了农民革命。广州起义及其失败后的事实，又一次证明了工人阶级必须与农民结成密切的联盟。没有农民的积极参加，没有广泛的农民革命，要取得中国革命的胜利是不可能的。
    广州起义是在中国革命失败的形势下举行的。当时在敌人的进攻面前，“整个党的组织需要的是正确的退却，而不是继续的进攻；局部的武装斗争，暂时也只能成为一种特殊形式的防御。”（胡乔木：中国共产党的三十年）因此当时，在中国革命低潮、敌强我弱的形势下进行的“广州起义”，虽然起义者空前英勇和坚决斗争，但要长期占领广州这样的大城市，结果也就不能不陷于失败。广州起义及其失败，又一次证明了中国革命的长期性和残酷性；证明了中国民主革命的主要形式不能采取和平的形式，必须是武装斗争；证明了中国革命必须首先在农村建立根据地。
    广州起义到今天已经三十年了。今天的中国已经是社会主义的中国了，但是三十年前参加广州起义的英雄们的战斗精神和死难烈士的壮烈事迹，仍然鼓舞着正在建设社会主义祖国和维护世界和平的广州人民和中国人民胜利前进的步伐。
    伟大的广州起义的事迹和起义牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
