　　Marching into the Mountainous Areas
　　Wang Jingzhi, a veteran revolutionary, once tempered himself in the mountainous areas; the younger generation must march into the mountainous areas to accept the test. Iron muscles and bones are tempered by climbing mountains and crossing ridges; a strong will is tempered by enduring hardship and hard work. Accustomed to rain, snow, ice, and frost, accustomed to the scorching sun and raging winds, enduring thousands of hammerings and overcoming thousands of hardships and difficulties, only then can we have a spine that can withstand heavy pressure, iron shoulders that can bear heavy burdens, and be able to withstand risks! After a hundred battles on the battlefield, one can become a great general. If ore is not tempered by fire, how can it become steel? Warm rooms and lukewarm water can never make steel. Marxism-Leninism must be cultivated through struggle and labor, not decorated with rhetoric. Educated youth going to the countryside and mountainous areas is not using steel as wood, but turning scrap iron into steel through tempering. Rotten wood is afraid of the furnace fire, but iron is not afraid of the furnace! We must transform ourselves into peasants and share the hardships with them. Make river water flow up the mountains, green the barren mountains, conserve water and soil, eradicate water and drought disasters, create endless wealth, and turn poor mountains and valleys into immortal residences full of flowers and fruits. To sit back and enjoy ready-made blessings in a place of ease and comfort is the greatest shame; to sow happiness in the most difficult places is a noble aspiration!

　　向山区进军
　　汪静之革命老前辈曾经在山区锻炼；后辈要向山区进军，去接受考验。铜筋铁骨靠爬山越岭来磨练；坚强的意志靠吃苦耐劳来锻炼。受惯雨雪冰霜，受惯日毒风狂，熬过千锤百炼，克服千苦万难，才有顶得住重压的脊梁，才有挑得起重担的铁肩，才经得起风险！百战疆场，才能成大将。矿石不经过火炼，怎能够成钢？暖气房，温吞水，决炼不成钢。马列主义，要用斗争和劳动来培养，不是用辞句来装璜。知识分子下乡上山，不是钢材当木材用，是废铁不炼不成钢。是烂木头才怕炉火，是铁就不怕炉膛！要把自己化成农民，和农民一同劳苦。叫河水流上山顶，绿化荒山，保持水土，根绝水旱天灾，创造无穷财富，把穷山苦岭，造成花果满山的仙府。在安乐之场，坐享现成福，是莫大的耻辱；到最艰苦的地方去播种幸福，是崇高的抱负！
