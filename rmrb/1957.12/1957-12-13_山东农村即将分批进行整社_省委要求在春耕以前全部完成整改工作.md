Shandong Rural Areas to Undergo Rectification in Batches
    Provincial Party Committee Requires Completion Before Spring Plowing

    (Our dispatch) Shandong Province has summarized the pilot experience of grassroots rectification in rural areas. Based on the principle of "production and rectification proceed simultaneously," the province has determined the steps and methods for grassroots Party rectification and commune rectification in rural areas.

    From the preliminary experience of twenty-six communes in eleven townships, as summarized by the Provincial Party Committee at the pilot work conference last month, as long as rectification is arranged uniformly at the township level, it will not only not affect production, but will also greatly promote the production movement. In Licheng County, the work in pilot communes began with checking and arranging production, and making improvements based on the opinions voiced by the masses. Urgent problems in production and management were resolved in a timely manner, thus powerfully promoting the autumn harvest, drought resistance for wheat planting, and current water conservancy construction.

    In order to implement the central government's instructions, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee has put forward specific requirements for grassroots Party rectification and commune rectification: (1) Continue to examine and criticize capitalism, further strengthen the belief in taking the socialist road, and establish the spirit of hard struggle, perseverance, and indomitable overcoming of difficulties. (2) Overcome the work styles of coercion and commandism, undemocratic practices, not participating in labor, not caring about the well-being of the masses, and extravagance and waste. Establish the work style of proceeding from reality, presenting facts, reasoning things out, persuading people with reason, and consulting with the masses in everything. (3) Adjust the leadership composition of the Party and the communes, so that the Party branches and commune leadership are in the hands of outstanding and reliable Party and League members, establishing the core leadership of the Party and the advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants in the cooperatives. (4) Rectify the production management and financial management systems of the cooperatives, implement mutually beneficial policies, and resolve the legacy issues of joining the cooperatives.

    The Provincial Party Committee emphasized that in the rectification process, it is still necessary to resolutely, boldly, and thoroughly encourage the masses to speak out and air their views fully. Don't assume that because socialist education has already involved speaking out in the previous stage, there is no need to encourage further expression. At the same time, it is necessary to resolutely, thoroughly, and comprehensively rectify.

    The Provincial Party Committee urged Party committees at all levels not to miss the opportunity, and to promptly launch rectification in batches, striving to complete the rectification work comprehensively before spring plowing.

　　山东农村即将分批进行整社
    省委要求在春耕以前全部完成整改工作
    本报讯　山东省总结了农村基层整风试点经验，并根据生产整风两不误的精神，确定了农村基层整党、整社的步骤和做法。
    从上月省委在试点工作会议总结的十一个乡的二十六个社的初步经验看，只要在乡里统一安排整风，不仅不会影响生产，而且会大大地推动生产运动。历城县在试点社进行工作就是首先检查安排好生产，并根据群众鸣放的意见边整边改，及时解决生产上和经营管理上的迫切问题，因而对秋收、抗旱种麦及当前的水利建设都起了有力的推动作用。
    山东省委为了贯彻执行中央指示，提出具体的基层整党、整社要求：（1）继续检查批判资本主义，进一步坚定走社会主义道路的信念，树立艰苦奋斗、坚忍不拔、百折不挠克服困难的精神。（2）克服强迫命令、不民主、不劳动、不关心群众疾苦、铺张浪费作风，树立从实际出发、摆事实、讲道理、以理服人、遇事同群众商量的工作作风。（3）调整党、社的领导成分，使党支部和社的领导掌握在优秀可靠的党团员手中，树立党的领导核心和贫农、下中农在合作社中的优势。（4）整顿合作社的生产管理和财务管理制度，贯彻互利政策，解决入社遗留问题。
    省委强调各地在整改中仍然要坚决地、大胆地、彻底地大放大鸣，充分发动群众提意见，不要因为前一阶段社会主义教育已经鸣放了，而不再发动放鸣。同时，又要坚决地、彻底地、全面地整改。
    省委要求各级党委不要失去时机，整改应迅速分批展开，争取春耕以前能全面完成整改工作。
