Comrades, Friends:

    I now declare the Eighth National Congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions open.

    Since the Seventh National Congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, historical and profound changes have taken place in our country's social life. Our socialist revolution has achieved a basic victory, and our socialist construction has achieved great development. The first five-year plan for the development of the national economy has been completed and overfulfilled, laying a preliminary foundation for the development of modern industry and modern agriculture in our country. This year, a vigorous nationwide rectification movement has been carried out throughout the country, which has had a far-reaching impact on our country's social life, and a new upsurge in production has begun to emerge.

    The Eighth National Congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, convened under such circumstances, is of great significance.

    The vanguard of the Chinese working class—the Communist Party of China—has always been deeply concerned about our country's trade union movement, and our country's trade union movement has always advanced along the Party's correct line. Under the cultivation of the Party, the Chinese working class has a glorious tradition of diligence, bravery, and hard work, and the Chinese trade unions are in close contact with the masses and have played an important role in our country's revolution and construction.

    This congress will, in accordance with the spirit of the resolutions of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, sum up the experiences and lessons of our country's trade union work over the past four years; discuss and decide on the specific tasks of the national workers and trade unions during the period of the second five-year plan. This congress will revise the Constitution of the Chinese Trade Unions in accordance with the experience of the past few years and the current actual situation; and elect the Eighth Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

    Today, our most beloved Chairman Mao and the leading comrades of the Party and the state have personally come to attend our congress. On behalf of the congress, I would like to express our highest and warmest respect to our great leader and the leading comrades of the Party and the state.

    Also attending the congress today are representatives of various democratic parties in our country. The democratic parties have played an important role in our country's revolution and socialist construction. We express our respect to them.

    Today, representatives of various government departments and people's organizations are attending our congress. They have given us a lot of help in our work. We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to them.

    Attending our congress are also the delegation of the World Federation of Trade Unions headed by Comrade Saillant; the trade union delegation of our great ally, the Soviet Union; the trade union delegations from fraternal countries such as Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, Vietnam, and Yugoslavia; the trade union delegations from Asian countries such as Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, Iran, and Japan; the trade union delegations from Arab and African countries such as Egypt, Jordan, Sudan, and Mauritius, where the national independence movement is flourishing, as well as the delegation of the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions; the trade union delegations from European countries such as Austria, Finland, and France, and the trade union delegation from Australia; and the Argentine trade union delegation from Latin America, who have come from afar. The participation of so many countries' trade union delegations in our congress vividly demonstrates the friendship and support of the working classes of various countries for the working class of our country. We would like to extend a warm welcome and pay our brotherly respects to them.

    Next year, our country's second five-year plan for the development of the national economy will begin. Our country's working class will certainly be able to successfully complete this plan in accordance with the principle of building the country with diligence and thrift, and our country's trade unions will certainly be able to continue to play its important role.

    At present, the world situation is at a new and great historical turning point. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the forces of world peace have definitely surpassed the forces of the imperialist camp headed by the United States. We are full of victorious confidence in the bright and happy future of mankind. We will work together with the working class of the world to strive for world peace and the cause of human progress!

    We can fully expect that this congress will successfully complete its tasks.

    在中国工会全国代表大会上的开幕词
　　刘长胜同志们、朋友们：
    我现在宣布，中国工会第八次全国代表大会开幕。
    自从中国工会第七次全国代表大会以来，我国社会生活发生了历史性的深刻变化。我国社会主义革命已经取得了基本胜利，我国社会主义建设获得了巨大发展，发展国民经济的第一个五年计划已经完成和超额完成，给我国发展近代工业和近代农业奠定了初步基础。今年，全国各地开展了蓬蓬勃勃的全民性的整风运动，对我国社会生活发生了极为深远的影响，一个新的生产高潮，已经开始出现。
    在这样的情况下召开的中国工会第八次全国代表大会，有着重要的意义。
    中国工人阶级先锋队——中国共产党，对于我国工会运动，从来是亲切关怀的，我国工会运动，从来是沿着党的正确路线前进的。在党的培养下，中国工人阶级有着勤劳勇敢、艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，中国工会是联系群众的，在我国革命和建设事业中，是发挥了重要作用的。
    这次大会，要根据中国共产党第八次全国代表大会决议的精神，总结四年来我国工会工作的经验教训；讨论和决定全国职工和工会在第二个五年计划时期的具体任务。这次大会要根据几年来的经验和当前的实际情况，修订中国工会章程；选举中华全国总工会第八届执行委员会。
    今天，我们最敬爱的毛主席、党和国家的领导同志，亲自来参加我们的大会，我谨代表大会向我们伟大的领袖、党和国家的领导同志表示最崇高、最热烈的敬意。
    今天参加大会的还有我国各民主党派代表，各民主党派在我国革命和社会主义建设中起了重要作用。我们向他们表示敬意。
    今天，参加我们大会的，有政府各部门、各人民团体的代表，他们在工作中给了我们很多帮助，我们谨向他们表示衷心的感谢。
    参加我们大会的，还有以赛扬同志为首的世界工会联合会代表团；有我们伟大盟邦苏联工会代表团，有阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、朝鲜、蒙古、波兰、罗马尼亚、越南、南斯拉夫等兄弟国家工会代表团；有来自缅甸、锡兰、印度、印度尼西亚、伊朗、日本等亚洲国家的工会代表团，有来自民族独立运动正在蓬勃发展的埃及、约旦、苏丹、毛里求斯等阿拉伯和非洲各国的工会代表团以及阿拉伯工会国际联合会的代表团；有来自奥地利、芬兰、法国等欧洲各国的工会代表团和澳大利亚的工会代表团；有远道而来的拉丁美洲的阿根廷工会代表。这么多国家的工会代表团参加我们的大会，生动地表现了各国工人阶级对我国工人阶级的友谊和支持。我们谨向他们表示热烈的欢迎，致以兄弟的敬意。
    明年，我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划就要开始了。我国工人阶级一定能够本着勤俭建国的方针，胜利地完成这个计划，我国工会一定能够继续发挥它的重大作用。
    目前世界形势正处在一个新的伟大的历史转折点。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和世界和平的力量，已经确定地超过了以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的力量。我们对人类的光明和幸福的未来，充满了胜利的信心。我们要同全世界工人阶级一起，为世界和平和人类进步事业共同奋斗！
    我们完全可以预期，这次大会将会胜利地完成它的任务。
