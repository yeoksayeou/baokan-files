　　A Shot of Tranquilizer That Misses the Mark

    In order to investigate the reasons for the backwardness of the American missile program, the U.S. Senate Armed Services Subcommittee held a series of hearings. One after another, "authoritative" figures took the stage to express their opinions.

    Senator Lyndon B. Johnson, the Democratic leader of the U.S. Senate, who presided over the hearings, said that the United States had "lost" to the Soviet Union "in an important battle on the technical front."

    Then, Dr. Teller, the famous physicist known as the "father of the hydrogen bomb," admitted that the Soviet Union already possessed intercontinental missiles and had moved ahead of the United States in missile development; moreover, in his view, if both countries continued to develop missiles at their current pace, the Soviet Union would leave the United States far behind.

    The opinion that most "shocked" the American ruling group came from Allen Dulles, director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency; according to several senators who listened to the intelligence chief's opinion afterwards, he depicted "a bleak and shocking" picture, which, once revealed, would "shock and end the complacency" of American officials and the public.

    U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Quarles apparently believed that these opinions, which "exalted others' ambitions and diminished one's own morale," were harmful, and he felt it necessary to put on a brave face and talk big to calm people's minds. Thus, this U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense bragged regardless of the facts, openly saying that "on the whole today" the U.S. missile program was ahead of Russia, and that the U.S. intercontinental missile development plan was at least "on par" with Russia.

    Look how decisive! In a few words, everything such as "backwardness," "loss," and "bleak and shocking" scenes were swept away!

    Unfortunately, the experts under Quarles who were responsible for the missile program could not "keep pace" with him in adding luster to the U.S. missile program. Just the day after Quarles spoke, the launch test of the "Jupiter" missile failed again, and this "Jupiter" was only a medium-range missile!

    Quarles' shot of tranquilizer has missed the mark. The question is, when this U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense, who cannot pass as overweight even with a swollen face, receives the news of the failure of the "Jupiter" test, what method can he use to put his mind at ease? (Journey)

　　投空的定心丸
    为了追究美国导弹计划落后的责任，美国参议院军备小组委员会举行了一系列的意见听取会。一个接着一个的“权威”人士走上讲台，发表了他们自己的意见。
    主持这次意见听取会的美国参议院民主党领袖约翰逊说：“在技术方面的一场重要战斗中”，美国“输给”苏联了。
    接着，被誉为美国“氢弹之父”的著名物理学家泰勒博士承认苏联已拥有洲际导弹，在导弹发展方面已走在美国前面；而且，照他看来，如果两国都继续以自己目前的速度发展导弹，那末，苏联就要把美国撇在很远的后边。
    最使美国统治集团感到“震惊”的意见来自美国中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯；据听取了这个特务头子的意见的几个参议员事后表示，他描绘了“一副惨淡而使人震惊的”景象，一旦透露出去，就会使美国的官员们和公众“震惊而不再自满”。
    美国国防部副部长卡利斯显然认为以上这些“长他人志气、灭自己威风”的意见是有害的，他觉得有必要打肿脸充胖子，说一些大话来安定人心。于是，这位美国的国防部副部长就不顾事实地吹嘘起来了，他公然说“总的来说今天”美国的导弹计划是走在俄国的前面，至于美国的洲际导弹发展的计划至少同俄国“是一种并驾齐驱的情况”。
    瞧，多干脆！三言两语就把什么“落后”呀，“输了”呀，“惨淡而使人震惊”的景象呀等等都一扫而空！
    可惜，卡利斯手下那些负责导弹计划的专家们却不能同他“并驾齐驱”地为美国的导弹计划增光。就在卡利斯发言之后的第二天，“丘辟特”式导弹的发射试验又一次失败了，而这“丘辟特”式还仅仅是一种中程导弹呢！
    卡利斯的定心丸已经投空了。问题是这位打肿了脸还充不了胖子的美国国防部副部长在接到“丘辟特”式试验失败的消息的时候，又能用什么方法来使自己心安理得呢？　（旅）
