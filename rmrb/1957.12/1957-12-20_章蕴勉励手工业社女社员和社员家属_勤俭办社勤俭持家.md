Xinhua News Agency, December 19th: Zhang Yun, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, called on female members and family members of handicraft cooperatives to run cooperatives and manage households thriftily.

Zhang Yun delivered a speech today at the First Member Representative Congress of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives.

Zhang Yun said: Under the kind care and wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the cooperativization of handicrafts has been successfully completed, and handicraft production has been developed. This has opened up a broad path for women to participate in labor. Currently, there are 1.5 million women in handicraft cooperatives across the country, accounting for about 30% of the total number of members. After joining the cooperatives, thanks to the care and cultivation of the cooperative organizations and their own efforts, their socialist consciousness has been raised. They have humbly learned and studied technology, and their production capacity has also been improved, thus playing an important role in developing handicrafts and improving handicraft production. Many female members are outstanding inheritors of China's rich and colorful arts and crafts heritage of thousands of years. There are also many cooperatives organized by housewives, which are examples of "running cooperatives thriftily and serving thriftily," and are deeply praised by the masses in urban and rural areas. In the labor emulation campaigns, many female members have been评为 advanced producers. Because female members have demonstrated their role in production, their social status has been greatly improved. Many female members have taken on leadership positions in the cooperatives, and many female members have also been elected as people's representatives and members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). At the same time, the families of the vast number of handicraftsmen have also played a significant role in implementing the "Five Goods," managing households thriftily, encouraging members to take the road of cooperativization, and supporting members' production and labor, thereby also improving their social and family status and receiving social respect.

She continued: Our country has entered a new historical period. Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the people of the whole country are resolutely and confidently marching towards a strong socialist country. The responsibility of female members and family members of handicraft cooperatives lies in running cooperatives thriftily and managing households thriftily. If we achieve hard work and thrift, practice economy, and plan our household expenses in a planned way, achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results in production, and practice careful calculation, frugality, and thrift in consumption, then we will have fulfilled our responsibilities and made contributions to completing the above glorious and great task of building socialism, and at the same time achieved the unity of patriotism, love for the cooperative, and love for the family.

Zhang Yun hoped that female members and their families, together with all members, would actively participate in the struggle between the two roads of breaking capitalism and establishing socialism and the rectification movement currently underway throughout the country, further correct their political direction, unswervingly take the socialist road, consciously pass the socialist test, and more deeply understand the consistency of national interests, cooperative interests, and individual interests, and strive for victory and new achievements simultaneously from the production front and the ideological front.

Finally, she stated that women's federations must continue to maintain regular contact with cooperative organizations and care for the production and life of female members and their families in order to better exert the active role of female members and their families and make greater contributions to socialist construction.

    章蕴勉励手工业社女社员和社员家属
    勤俭办社勤俭持家
    新华社19日讯　全国妇女联合会副主席章蕴号召手工业合作社的女社员和社员家属勤俭办社和勤俭持家。
    章蕴今天在中华全国手工业合作社第一次社员代表大会上致词。
    章蕴说：在中国共产党和人民政府的亲切关怀和英明领导下，手工业合作化胜利完成，手工业生产得到发展，这为妇女开拓了一条宽广的参加劳动的道路。现在全国手工业合作社中有一百五十万妇女，约占社员总数30％左右。她们参加合作社以后，由于社组织的关怀、培养和自我努力，提高了社会主义觉悟；她们虚心学习，钻研技术，也提高了生产能力，从而在发展手工业和提高手工业生产上，起了重要的作用。许多女社员是我国几千年来丰富多彩的工艺美术遗产的优秀继承者。还有许多由家庭妇女组织起来的合作社，是“勤俭办社、勤俭服务”的范例，深得城乡群众的称赞。在劳动竞赛运动中许多女社员被评为先进生产者。由于女社员在生产上显示了作用，她们的社会地位大大提高了。许多女社员担任了社的领导工作，许多女社员还当选为人民代表和政协委员。同时，广大手工业者的家属们，在执行“五好”，勤俭持家，鼓励社员走合作化道路，支援社员生产劳动等方面也发挥了很大的作用，从而也提高了社会和家庭地位，受到了社会的尊敬。
    她接着说：我国已经进入一个新的历史时期。全国人民在党和人民政府的领导下，坚决而满怀信心地向着社会主义强国迈进。作为手工业合作社的女社员和社员家属的责任，就在于勤俭办社和勤俭持家。我们如果做到了勤劳生产，厉行节约，有计划地安排家务开支，在生产上做到多、快、好、省，在消费上做到精打细算、省吃俭用，那末，我们就是为完成上述光荣而伟大的建设社会主义的任务尽到了责任，作出了贡献，同时也达到了爱国、爱社、爱家的统一。
    章蕴希望女社员们和社员家属们，和全体社员一起，积极参加正在全国开展的破资本主义、立社会主义的两条道路的斗争和整风运动，进一步端正自己的政治方向，坚定不移地走社会主义道路，自觉地过好社会主义这一关，更深刻地认识国家利益、合作社利益、个人利益的一致性，从生产战线上和思想战线上同时争取胜利和新的成就。
    最后，她表示妇联组织一定要继续同合作社组织经常联系，关怀女社员和社员家属的生产和生活，以便更好地发挥女社员和社员家属的积极作用，在社会主义建设中作出更大的贡献。
