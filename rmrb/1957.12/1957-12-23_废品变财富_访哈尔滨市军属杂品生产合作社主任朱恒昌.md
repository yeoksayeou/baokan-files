    Turning Waste into Wealth
    —An Interview with Zhu Hengchang, Director of the Harbin Military Dependents Sundries Production Cooperative
    By Our Correspondent Sun Guang
    Near Binjiang Station, there's a place like this: the yard is piled high with all sorts of scrap copper and iron, dirty manure, broken burlap sacks, cloth scraps, weeds, broken wood, and countless other bits and pieces. Someone who doesn't know might think it's a scrap warehouse or a garbage dump, right? Wrong. This is the Harbin Military Dependents Sundries Production Cooperative, which "started from scratch without spending a penny." Because of its achievements in thrift and diligence, it was even named a model cooperative of the first rank in Harbin! One afternoon, I interviewed the cooperative's director, Zhu Hengchang—a delegate to the First National Congress of Members of the All-China Handicraft Cooperative.
    Zhu Hengchang said that the raw materials used by their cooperative for production are all kinds of waste discarded by factories. Last year alone, they used more than eighty kinds of waste materials to produce more than forty kinds of products. In 1955, they bought five tons of waste oil canvas gloves, which they boiled, washed, and took apart to make new gloves. The unusable scraps were sold to shoemakers to make shoe soles. Discarded old work clothes from factories were taken apart and washed. The large pieces were pieced together to make work uniforms, the smaller pieces were made into shoe covers, and the remaining strips of cloth were used to make floor brushes. The unusable cloth scraps were mashed and fluffed into sub-standard cotton for weaving blankets. They used waste iron scraps left over from iron factories to make parts for car horn cut-offs. The smaller iron scraps were made into hinges and bottle caps, and the rest were made into collar buttons, hairpins, and shoe eyelets. They washed, dyed, and sorted cotton covers, flax heads, and麻袋(mádài, bast bags) to weave sweaters, felt mats, and hemp knives. They also dug up a lot of sludge from the yards and ditches of the Harbin Woolen Mill, from which they picked out more than 10,000 *jin* of wool and manure. Agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Tianjin bought 410,000 *jin* of manure from them for fertilizer. If this is a sundries production cooperative, it’s better to say it’s a place that turns waste into wealth.
    The cooperative has only thirty-six members, four workshops, and four cadres—the director, accountant, purchaser, and warehouse keeper—all of whom are part-time. When you come to work, you can see an older person with an apron tied around their waist, either drying felt or sifting sheep manure with the members. Sometimes they also push a cart to deliver goods. This is the cooperative director, whom everyone calls Uncle Zhu, and the person who was talking to me. He is already sixty-three years old this year, but he works no less hard than a young man. In 1955, when the sundries cooperative had just been established, the cooperative didn't have much capital and had no money to buy a cart. Once, they needed to take the made report cards to be processed outside. Uncle Zhu thought that these things were not enough to pay for the cart fare, and he would not spend money if he could avoid it. So he carried the goods himself every day, and brought them back after finishing. When the members saw that Uncle Zhu was so old and still carrying the goods himself, they offered to take them after work and bring them back the next morning.
    Under Uncle Zhu's influence, thrift and diligence have become a good habit here. In 1955 and 1956, the cooperative never spent money on coal. Cooking oil clothes was done with rotten grass and broken wood chips picked out from the waste pile. Last year, administrative expenses amounted to only four hundred and twenty yuan (rent accounted for one-sixth). They also skimmed more than 300 *jin* of machine oil from the pots used to boil oil work clothes and gloves, so the oil used on the machines throughout the year did not cost any money. In Harbin in autumn, standing on the banks of the Songhua River is already bone-chilling, but the members are still washing dirty clothes in the river water, and no one complained. Is the cooperative unable to improve their working environment? No, the current cooperative is very different from when it was first established. In 1957, the cooperative accumulated more than 60,000 yuan, rented twelve factory buildings and a warehouse of more than 100 square meters. The machinery and equipment also went from nothing to something. Now there are eleven large and small pressing machines, one cotton gin, one sewing machine, and one loom. The average monthly income of each member has reached more than fifty yuan. But Uncle Zhu said: We are used to being thrifty. We started out like this, and we have always maintained the style of hard work and plain living. Now, the director's office is still the old desk and a few old benches from the past.
    They never forget the situation when the cooperative was first established. It was in early 1955 when the government called on military martyrs' families to "rely on their own efforts" and reduce government subsidies to military martyrs' families. Military dependents' representative Zhu Hengchang and two other military dependents organized the sundries production cooperative, "starting from scratch without spending a penny." The capital was borrowed from brother cooperatives, and they rented a few thatched houses and brought their own tools. At that time, because they could not buy waste materials, the three of them did not receive wages for three months. After formal production, each person earned only eight or nine *jiao* (tenths of yuan), now the average earning is more than fifty yuan. After joining the cooperative, the lives of handicraftsmen have also been guaranteed, and some no longer need government relief. The members said: If we run the cooperative according to this path, as long as everyone is united, we will definitely run the cooperative well.
    The members of this cooperative are all military dependents and martyrs' families. In terms of age, there are old men and women in their fifties and sixties, teenage girls, and disabled people. Only Li Xinghou is a skilled worker (seventh-grade fitter). At the beginning, they let young women follow Li Xinghou to learn skills in the small workshop, and the elderly and those with poor eyesight went to the riverbank to wash clothes. For more than three years, most of the members have learned several skills and can adapt to the ever-changing raw materials. Uncle Zhu used to study tailoring and lived in a dyeing workshop. Now he not only leads the entire cooperative, but is also a very good purchaser. The accountant of the cooperative is also wherever there is something to do. They often get up in the morning to market products, participate in production during the day, and write accounts at night. Some members are carpenters and tailors. After the nationwide campaign to increase production and practice economy, many factories have proposed to save cotton cloth, not to receive new work clothes, and to dismantle and wash the old ones themselves. In this way, the raw materials of the brush workshop will have difficulties. Uncle Zhu anticipated this situation in advance and suggested that the brush workshop be changed to a sheet metal workshop. The members learned the technology and quickly changed it. Now this workshop produces stoves, chimneys, kettles, dustpans and other more than ten kinds of products. The product quality is very good, the price is cheap, and it is very popular among consumers.
    Up to now, they have established contact with twenty-three factories in Harbin. In the future, their raw materials will be inexhaustible and inexhaustible.

    废品变财富
    ——访哈尔滨市军属杂品生产合作社主任朱恒昌
    本报记者  孙光
    在滨江站附近，有这样一个地方：院子里堆满各种各样的破铜烂铁，脏粪土，破麻袋片，布片，乱草，碎木头和数不清的破乱东西。不知道的人，也许以为这是一个废品仓库，或者是垃圾站吧？不。这是哈尔滨市“白手起家、一文不花”的军属杂品生产合作社，因为勤俭办社有成绩，还被评为哈尔滨市的一等模范社哩！ 一天下午，我访问了这个社的主任朱恒昌——出席中华全国手工业合作社第一次社员代表大会的代表。
    朱恒昌说，他们社生产用的原料，都是工厂扔掉的各种废物，去年一年，利用八十几种废料生产了四十多种产品。1955年，他们买了五吨废油帆布手套，回来用锅煮，用水洗，拆出整块的做成手套，把破烂不能用的卖给了制鞋工人做鞋底，工厂不要的破旧工作服，经过拆洗，他们把大块的拼成作业服，小块的做护脚鞋盖，剩下的布条子做成地板刷，把最后不能用的布头布角捣乱以后，弹成次棉花，织毯子，他们用铁工厂剩下来的废铁角子做汽车喇叭断电用的零件，再小的铁角做折页、瓶盖、剩下的做色扣、发卡和鞋眼。他们把棉花套、亚麻头、麻袋洗染整理，织成毛衣、毡垫和麻刀。他们还从哈尔滨毛织厂院子和阴沟里挖出许多污泥，从里面挑出一万多斤羊毛和粪土。天津郊区的农业生产合作社就从他们手里买去四十一万斤粪土做肥料。如果说这是个杂品生产社，倒不如说它是个变废物为财富的地方。
    合作社只有三十六名社员，四个车间，四个干部——主任、会计、采买和保管，都是半脱产的。上班的时候，你可以在院子里看到一个扎着围裙的上了年纪的人，不是在晒毡子就是和社员在一起筛羊粪，有时候也推着车子去送货，这就是人们都称作朱大爷的社主任，也就是跟我谈话的人。他今年已经六十三岁了，可是干起活来却不次于年青小伙子。1955年，杂品社刚刚成立不久，社里资金不多，没有钱买车，有一次需要把做的报卡子拿到外边加工，朱大爷想这点东西还不够付车钱的呢，能不花的钱就不花。于是他每天就自己背着货送去，做完再背回来。社员看见朱大爷这么大年纪还自己背着送货，都提出下班时自己带着送去，第二天早晨上班时再拿回来。
    在朱大爷的影响下，勤俭办社在这里已经成了一种很好的习惯。1955年和1956年，社里从来没有花钱买过煤，煮油衣服都是用从废物堆里挑出来的烂草和碎木片。去年一年支出的行政管理费用四百二十多元（房租费占六分之一）。他们还从煮油工作服、手套的锅里澄出三百多斤机器油，一年到头机器上使用的油就不用花钱买了。哈尔滨的秋天，站在松花江边已经是冷飕飕的了，但社员们还在江水里洗脏衣裳，谁也没闹情绪。难道社里没有能力把他们的工作环境改善得更好吗？不是，现在的合作社和刚成立时已经大不相同了。1957年，社里积累的资金就有六万多元，租了十二间厂房，一百多平方公尺的仓库，机器设备也是从无到有，现在有大小压力机十一台，弹棉机、缝纫机、织布机各一台；社员每人每月的平均收入已经达到五十多元。可是朱大爷说：我们勤俭惯了，从开始就是这样，现在还一直保持着艰苦朴素的作风。现在社主任的办公室，仍然是过去那张桌子和几条旧板凳。
    他们从来不忘刚成立社的情形。那是1955年初，政府号召军烈属“生产自救”，减经政府对军烈属的补助。军属代表朱恒昌和其他两个军属在一起组织起来的杂品生产社，“白手成家、一文没花”，资金是从兄弟社借来的，租了几间草房，自己拿工具。当时因为买不到废料，他们三个人三个月没要工资，正式生产以后，每人才挣八九角钱，现在平均挣五十几元。手工业者入社以后生活也有了保证，有的已经不要政府救济了。社员们说：按照这条道办社，只要大家齐心，准能把社办好。
    这个社的社员都是军属和烈属，从年龄来讲，有五六十岁的老头和老太太，有十几岁的姑娘，还有残废人。只有李兴厚一个人是技术工人（七级钳工）。开始，他们让年轻女同志跟着李兴厚在细小车间学技术，年纪大的和眼睛不好的都到江沿洗衣服。三年多来，大多数社员都学会几种本领，可以适应原料的千变万化。朱大爷原来学过裁缝，又住过染房，现在他不但领导着全社，而且还是个非常出色的采买员。社里的会计也是哪儿有事到哪儿，经常是早晨起来上市推销产品，白天参加生产，晚上写账。有的社员是木匠又是裁缝。全国开展增产节约运动以后，很多工厂都提出节约棉布，不领新工作服，旧的也自己拆洗，这样刷子车间的原料将会发生困难。朱大爷事先估计到这种情况，建议把刷子车间改为黑白铁车间，社员们学习了技术很快就改过来了。现在这个车间生产炉子、烟筒、水壶、簸箕等十几种产品，产品质量很好，价格便宜，很受消费者欢迎。
    到现在，他们已和哈尔滨市的二十三个工厂建立了联系，今后他们的原料将是取之不尽，用之不竭的。
