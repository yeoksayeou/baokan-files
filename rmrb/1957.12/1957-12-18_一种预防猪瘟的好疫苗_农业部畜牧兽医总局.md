　　Hog cholera rabbit-adapted attenuated vaccine is a good, low-cost, and easy-to-manufacture vaccine for preventing hog cholera. This vaccine was researched and trial-produced in 1956. In order to promote this vaccine, the Ministry of Agriculture has held two short-term training classes on hog cholera rabbit-adapted attenuated vaccine, and the trained cadres have taught this technology to veterinary staff in their respective regions. In the past two years, approximately 2,000 veterinary personnel across the country have mastered the vaccine production technology and have begun to promote its application on a large scale. As of the first half of 1957, a total of more than 1.32 million pigs in 339 counties and cities in 20 provinces (cities, and districts) had been preventively inoculated, with universally good results. At the National Hog Disease Prevention and Control Symposium held in August this year, it was determined that hog cholera would be basically eliminated nationwide during the Second Five-Year Plan period. The symposium believed that in order to prevent and control hog cholera, in addition to taking other measures, it is necessary to vigorously promote hog cholera rabbit-adapted attenuated vaccine and carry out preventive inoculations universally.

　　Currently, many regions in Liaoning, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Shandong, Henan, and Beijing are using hog cholera rabbit-adapted attenuated vaccine on a large scale for hog cholera preventive inoculation. According to incomplete statistics, counties in Liaoning Province have inoculated more than 2 million pigs with hog cholera rabbit-adapted attenuated vaccine, Jiangxi Province has inoculated more than 600,000 pigs, and Beijing has inoculated more than 55,000 pigs.

　　What are the benefits of using this vaccine?

　　First, it is safe to inject, provides rapid immunity, and has a long immunity period. According to a 1956 survey, the reaction rate of 273,600 pigs injected with this vaccine was 1.1%. Immunity was generated on the fourth day after injection, and the protection rate was 100%. The immunity period for weaned pigs is up to one and a half years, and for nursing pigs, it is up to nine months. If piglets are injected once after weaning, they can be free from hog cholera for life until they are fattened.

　　Second, the vaccine is easy to produce, can be produced locally, and is inexpensive. Generally, intermediate-level veterinary personnel can master the vaccine production technology after a short-term training of half a month. Veterinary personnel can carry the seed virus and, with rabbits and simple equipment for vaccine production, can produce vaccines in large quantities on-site to meet the needs of epidemic prevention. On average, each inoculated rabbit (weighing three to four catties) can have approximately three centimeters of lymph nodes and spleen, and thirty to fifty milliliters of heart blood taken, which can be made into a vaccine for preventing 300 pigs. The cost of preventing one pig with the vaccine is only a little over one fen, which is much cheaper than using hog cholera crystal violet vaccine. If hog cholera rabbit-adapted attenuated vaccine is used to prevent hog cholera in 100 million pigs nationwide annually, it can save 7 million yuan in vaccine costs and save 100 million live pigs needed to manufacture hog cholera crystal violet vaccine. In addition, it can save a lot of investment in manpower and materials.

　　Hog cholera rabbit-adapted attenuated vaccine has a very good effect on preventing hog cholera. If this vaccine is used for injection every year, 70% to 80% of the number of pigs raised each year can be immunized, and hog cholera can be eliminated after three to five years of continuous application.

　　一种预防猪瘟的好疫苗
    农业部畜牧兽医总局
    猪瘟兔化弱毒疫苗是一种效果好、成本低、制造简便的预防猪瘟的疫苗。这种疫苗是在1956年研究试制成的。为了推广这种疫苗，农业部先后举办了两次猪瘟兔化弱毒疫苗短期训练班，并由受训的干部在本地区的兽医工作人员当中传授这种技术。两年来全国各地已有约二千多兽医人员掌握了制苗技术，并已开始大量推广应用。截至1957年上半年，二十个省（市、区）的三百三十九个县、市共预防注射生猪一百三十二万多头，结果普遍良好。今年8月在全国防治猪病座谈会上，研究确定在第二个五年计划期间内，全国基本消灭猪瘟。座谈会认为，在防治猪瘟上，除采取其他措施外，要大力推广猪瘟兔化弱毒疫苗，普遍进行预防注射。
    目前辽宁、江西、广西、四川、浙江、湖南、山东、河南等省和北京市许多地区大量应用猪瘟兔化弱毒疫苗进行猪瘟预防注射。据不完全统计，辽宁省各县已用猪瘟兔化弱毒疫苗注射了二百多万头猪，江西省已注射六十多万头，北京市已注射五万五千多头。
    用这种疫苗的好处有那一些呢？
    第一、注射安全、免疫快、免疫期间长。据1956年调查，注射这种疫苗的二十七万三千六百头猪，反应率为1.1％，注射后第四天即产生免疫力，保护率为100％；免疫期，对断奶的猪达一年半，对哺乳的猪达九个月。如果仔猪断奶后，注射一针，一直到肥育猪就可以一生不感染猪瘟了。
    第二、制苗简易、就地生产、成本低廉。一般中级兽医人员经过半个月的短期学习，就可以掌握制苗技术。兽医人员带上种毒，只要有家兔和简单制苗用的设备，在现地就可大量生产疫苗，满足防疫需要。每只接种的家兔（体重三至四斤的）平均可采取淋巴结、脾脏约三公分，心血三十到五十毫升，可制成预防三百头猪用的疫苗，预防一次猪的疫苗成本费只需一分多钱，比应用猪瘟结晶紫疫苗要便宜很多。如果利用猪瘟兔化弱毒疫苗，全国一年预防猪瘟一亿头次，就能节约疫苗费七百万元，和节省十万万头制造猪瘟结晶紫疫苗所需的生猪。此外还能节约不少人力、物力的投资。
    猪瘟兔化弱毒疫苗预防猪瘟的效果很好，如果每年采用这种疫苗注射，每年使养猪数的70％—80％能得到免疫力，再连续进行三、五年就可以消灭猪瘟了。（附图片）
