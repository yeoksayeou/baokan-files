Xinhua News Agency, December 18th: The successful experience of Daquanshan, Shanxi Province, in water and soil conservation has been disseminated throughout the country. Many areas that promoted it earlier have already achieved significant achievements in mountain area construction, and a batch of new "Daquanshans" have emerged.

From 1953 to the present, Daquanshan has warmly received more than 34,400 visitors from seventeen provinces across the country. During their visit to Daquanshan, Zhang Fenglin and Gao Jincai, the creators of the Daquanshan experience, personally introduced the experience, led visits to the mountains, and sometimes used on-site demonstrations and discussions to answer difficult questions, enabling visitors to learn the basic experience of Daquanshan in the shortest time. They brought these experiences to vast areas from Heilongjiang in the north to Yunnan in the south, and from Anhui in the east to Qinghai in the west, where they gradually took root and blossomed.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Water Resources, and the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and other units also sent people to Daquanshan to visit, carefully learn from the experience, and guide the national water and soil conservation work.

Simultaneous with visits and training, the Daquanshan Agricultural Cooperative also responded to invitations from various regions and successively dispatched 42 person-times to Henan, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, and Yanbei and Xin County in Shanxi to specifically impart technical experience and help local water and soil conservation work.

    大泉山好经验传播全国
    据新华社18日讯  山西省大泉山水土保持成功经验已经传播到全国各地。许多推广较早的地区，在山区建设上已经获得显著成就，出现了一批新的“大泉山”。
    从1953年到现在，大泉山热情地接待了来自全国十七个省的三万四千四百多个参观者。客人们在大泉山参观期间，大泉山经验的创造者张枫林、高进才亲自介绍经验，带领上山参观，有时用实地表演和座谈，解答疑难问题，使参观人员在最短期间学习到大泉山的基本经验，并且通过他们把这些经验带到了北至黑龙江、南至云南、东至安徽、西到青海等广大地区去，在那里陆续开花结果。
    中国科学院、水利部和黄河水利委员会等单位，也在这个期间派人到大泉山参观，认真吸取经验，指导全国水土保持工作。
    与参观训练同时，大泉山农业社还应各地邀请，陆续派出四十二人次，分别到河南、河北、内蒙古和山西的雁北、忻县等地区，具体传授技术经验，帮助当地作水土保持工作。（附图片）
