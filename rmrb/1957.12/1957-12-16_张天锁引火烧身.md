　　Recently, the workers of the operation section of the Datong Power Plant have been saying that the section chief Zhang Tiansuo has changed. Even Master Du, who had wanted to leave the operation section some time ago because he was dissatisfied with Zhang Tiansuo's rude style, said: "I want to continue working in the operation section because Director Zhang has changed."

　　Zhang Tiansuo was originally an old technical worker at the Datong Power Plant. As early as 1954, he received the title of Shanxi Provincial Industrial Labor Model. This old worker with more than twenty years of experience had rebuilt the power plant with the workers on the ruins of enemy sabotage. He often appeared in the workshop before the work whistle sounded; in the evening, he always left the workshop after ten o'clock. He hoped to do every job well and let every worker learn well. However, his stiff, rude, and un-masses-oriented work style often made things worse and caused losses. He often reprimanded workers in the workshop and argued with them. The workers said behind his back: "Director Zhang can't get through a day without arguing." He was the same not only to the workers but also to the other leaders of the section.

　　Zhang Tiansuo knew his faults, but when the workers raised objections, or when he thought of these faults himself, he always felt that he was loyal to the Party and had not let the people down, so he forgave his own mistakes.

　　It was not until early October this year, after the plant's Party committee held several mobilization meetings on carrying out the rectification movement, that Zhang Tiansuo felt that he had to consider his own problems. He carefully recalled his work since he became the workshop director in 1952. At first, he didn't feel anything, but later, the more he thought about it, the more problems he found. The losses to production and the revolution caused by his personal subjectivism and commandism all came to the fore. His mood became heavier and heavier. After several days of consideration, he finally made up his mind: to correct his shortcomings properly.

　　On October 14, the Datong Power Plant held a plant-wide rectification mobilization meeting. Three hours after the meeting, more than a dozen big-character posters appeared in the "Blooming and Contending Garden." That day, Zhang Tiansuo also left the workshop earlier than usual to see the big-character posters. When he saw that there were seven big-character posters criticizing him, his heart suddenly jumped up and down, and his face turned pale. It turned out that some of these big-character posters criticized him for being "subjective," some said he was "stiff and rude," some complained that he "handled things unfairly," and some accused him of "patriarchal leadership." These opinions greatly exceeded Zhang Tiansuo's expectations. As he read the big-character posters, listening to the familiar sound of the machines coming from the factory building, he couldn't help but shed tears. Finally, he took out his notebook and copied the big-character posters one by one. When he walked towards the dormitory, it was almost midnight.

　　That night, Zhang Tiansuo didn't close his eyes all night. "Why do the workers have so many opinions about me?" he thought over and over again. He opened his notebook and carefully considered his work, item by item. At this time, he suddenly remembered the Party's call to "draw fire to ourselves," and remembered the mobilization report of the Party committee secretary, and his mood gradually calmed down. He realized that the reason why he was so impulsive in the face of the workers' opinions was still due to strong subjectivism. Thinking of this, he became more calm. As soon as dawn broke, he hurried to the factory, muttering all the way: Listen to the Party, and improve with everyone's help.

　　The upsurge of the workers' blooming and contending in the plant quickly appeared. Hundreds and thousands of big-character posters were posted, and the workers also frankly criticized the leaders in group meetings. The big-character posters criticizing Zhang Tiansuo also increased from seven to more than fifty, and the opinions increased to more than one hundred. At this time, Zhang Tiansuo no longer felt aggrieved, but felt remorse. He seemed at a loss in his work. Just as he was wandering at a crossroads, Party committee secretary Tang Ming had a talk with him. He encouraged him to bravely accept criticism and resolutely improve his style. The Party committee secretary told him that as long as he faced up to his mistakes and was determined to correct them, his work would be done well and the workers would understand. This conversation was like a key, which made Zhang Tiansuo's heart brighten. After returning, he wrote a big-character poster, asking the workers to give him more opinions, and guaranteeing to the workers that he would resolutely correct his mistakes. When he met the workers in the workshop, he asked them to give him opinions.

　　While soliciting more opinions from the workers, Zhang Tiansuo turned his promises into action. He convened a meeting of deputy directors to solicit opinions on improving leadership work, and established a five-person rectification group in the workshop to specifically study and handle the workers' opinions. After some workers criticized in a big-character poster that the switch on the boiler had been burned out for more than a year and no one had paid attention to it, he immediately discussed it with Deputy Director Li Jiatong, started to solve it, and also personally solved the problem of installing windbreak cloths according to the workers' opinions.

　　From carefully summarizing his own lessons, Zhang Tiansuo understood the power of the masses. Now, whenever he encounters any major problems, he always discusses them with everyone to find a solution. Both the soot blowers and the water watchers were dissatisfied with their work. According to the old methods, Zhang Tiansuo would definitely have lectured them. This time, however, he convened a discussion with the workers. At the meeting, he explained to the workers the reason why the soot blowers must be specialized and not rotated, and adjusted the water watchers according to the workers' opinions, and the result was that everyone was very satisfied. Master Du, who had shed tears because he had been reprimanded by him, recently reported to him that the drainage ditch had not been dug through in a week and that he had to find a way. Master Du thought that Zhang Tiansuo would definitely get angry again. As a result, Zhang Tiansuo was not only not angry, but also asked for his opinion, and the problem was solved very smoothly.

　　In the operation section, from the drivers, stokers, laboratory workers to the apprentices, everyone now recognizes that Director Zhang has changed, has become more amiable, always discusses things with everyone, and work is easier to do. However, Zhang Tiansuo said, "The Party called for drawing fire to ourselves, I only got a little toasty, I still have to make drastic changes!" (Special contribution to this newspaper)

　　张天锁引火烧身
　　新华社记者
    最近，大同发电厂运行分场的工人们都说分场主任张天锁变样了。连前一个时期因为不满意张天锁粗暴作风要求离开运行分场的杜师傅也说：“我要在运行分场干下去，因为张主任已经变了。”
    张天锁原是大同发电厂的老技术工人。远在1954年，他就得到了山西省工业劳动模范的称号。这位有二十多年工龄的老工人，曾经和工人们一道在敌人破坏的废墟上重建了电厂。他常在上班汽笛响以前，就出现在车间里；晚上，总是在十点以后才离开车间。他希望把每一件工作做好，让每一个工人都学好。但是，他的生硬、粗暴、不走群众路线的工作作风，常常把好事办坏，造成损失。他经常在车间里训斥工人，同工人吵架。工人们在背地里说：“张主任一天不吵就过不去。”他不仅对工人，对分场的其他领导人也一样。
    张天锁是知道自己的毛病的，但是当工人提出了意见，或者自己想到这些毛病时，总是觉得自己对党忠心耿耿，没有对不起人民的地方，于是就原谅了自己的错误。
    直到今年10月初，厂党委会作了几次关于开展整风运动的动员以后，张天锁才感到非考虑自己的问题不行了。他细细地回想了一下，自1952年担任车间主任以来的工作，起初还感不到什么，可是后来，越想问题越多。由于个人的主观主义、命令主义给生产、给革命带来的损失都涌现在眼前。他的心情越来越沉重，经过几天考虑，才下了决心：好好改正缺点。
    10月14日，大同发电厂召开了全厂整风动员大会。会后三小时，“鸣放园地”就出现了十几张大字报。这天，张天锁也比平常早些离开了车间来看大字报。当他看到批评他的大字报就有七张时，他的心顿时七上八下地跳起来，脸色刷白。原来这些大字报有的批评他“主观”，有的说他“生硬、粗暴”，有的埋怨他“办事不公平”，有的指责他“家长式领导”。这些意见大大超出了张天锁的估计，他读着大字报，听着由厂房里传来的熟悉的机器响声，不由得流了眼泪。末了，他掏出笔记本，把大字报一张一张抄下来。当他向宿舍走去的时候，已是将近午夜十二点的时候了。
    这天晚上，张天锁整夜没有合眼。“为什么工人对我有这么多的意见？”他翻来复去地想着。他翻开笔记本，一条一条地对照着自己的工作仔细地考虑着。这时候，他突然想起了党的“引火烧身”的号召，想起了党委书记的动员报告，心境就渐渐平静下来。发觉自己所以在工人的意见面前如此冲动，仍然是强烈的主观主义在作祟。想到这里，他更心平气和了。天刚蒙蒙亮，他就匆匆地走向工厂，一路上叨念着：听党的话，在大家帮助下改进吧。
    厂里工人鸣放高潮很快就出现了，大字报成百成千地贴出来，工人们在小组会上也坦率地批评领导。批评张天锁的大字报也由七张增加到五十多张，意见增加到一百多条。这时，张天锁已经再不感到委屈，而是感到悔愧了。他在工作上显得无所适从。正在他彷徨歧路的时候，党委书记唐明找他谈了一次话。鼓励他勇敢地接受批评，坚决地改进作风。党委书记告诉他，只要他正视自己的错误，决心改正，工作就会做好，工人也会谅解。这次谈话就像一把钥匙，使张天锁的心豁亮了。回去以后，他就写一张大字报，要求工人给他提更多的意见，并且向工人保证要坚决改正自己的错误。他在车间里见了工人，就要求他们提意见。
    张天锁在征求工人更多的意见的同时，就把自己的诺言变成行动。他召集副主任们开会，征求对改进领导工作的意见，成立了车间的五人整改小组，专门研究和处理工人的意见。有的工人用大字报批评了锅炉上的开关被烧毁一年多无人过问的状况后，他马上就和副主任李家童研究，着手解决，还根据工人的意见，亲自动手解决了挡风布的安置问题。
    张天锁从仔细总结自己的教训中懂得了群众的力量。现在他遇到什么重大问题，总是要和大家商量解决。吹灰工和看水工都对工作不满意，按往昔的办法，张天锁一定要教训他们一顿。这次，他却召集工人进行了一次讨论，会上向工人解释吹灰工必须专业化，不能轮流值班的原因，又根据工人的意见调整了看水工，结果大家很满意。曾经因为受他训斥而掉过泪的杜师傅最近向他反映，排水沟一周没挖通，得想法子。杜师傅以为张天锁一定又要生气。结果，张天锁不仅不生气，反而征求了他的意见，问题很顺利地解决了。
    在运行分场，从司机、司炉、化验工到学徒，现在都公认张主任变了，变得和气了，有事总是要和大家商量，工作也好做了。可是，张天锁却说，“党号召引火烧身，我只烤了一下，还得狠狠地改哩！”　（本报特约稿）
