　　This newspaper reports that the Finance and Economics Publishing House recently published a batch of books on agriculture suitable for cadres going down to the countryside and up to the mountains to participate in agricultural production.

　　"Farmers' Lives, Past and Present": This book selects and compiles ten typical surveys of agricultural production and farmers' lives from counties, townships, cooperatives, and several farming households representing various regions of the country (such as plain paddy fields, plain dry farming areas, and hilly and mountainous areas). Using a comparative method, this book describes two different living conditions in rural areas, past and present, with a large number of vivid and specific materials.

　　"Preliminary Experience in Reforming the Cultivation System": Reforming the cultivation system is one of the current measures to increase agricultural production. Over the past few years, various parts of the country have accumulated a lot of experience in the reform of the cultivation system, and this book is a collection of experience in this area. The book contains nineteen articles, roughly divided into three parts: the reform of the cultivation system, the development of double-cropping rice, and the expansion of the multiple cropping area.

　　"Farmland Water Conservancy" and "Fertilizer": Building farmland water conservancy and accumulating fertilizer are the central tasks of agricultural cooperatives across the country this winter and next spring. "Farmland Water Conservancy" introduces the construction methods and irrigation and drainage techniques of farmland water conservancy such as ponds, small reservoirs, irrigation canals, and well drilling, with detailed illustrations. "Fertilizer" focuses on the effects of fertilization on crops, the types, properties, and application methods of fertilizers.
