Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 1st. After a socialist debate, farm households in Dangchang County who had moved from the high mountains to live in valley villages have recently been moving back to their original mountain homes. In the Guanting and Shawan districts alone, more than 200 households have moved back to the mountains, including some who originally lived in the valley villages.

90% of the cultivated land in Dangchang County is mountainous, so most of the residents live on the mountains. After collectivization, in addition to farmers on the mountains establishing agricultural cooperatives, some cooperatives were jointly established by residents of the valleys and residents of the mountains. In these cooperatives, mountain residents were unwilling to live on the mountains, believing that living on the mountains was hard and had many difficulties, and that they could not earn as many work points as valley residents. They said, "Since we can earn work points whether we are on the mountain or down in the valley, why should we live on the mountain?" Many farm households moved down. However, this brought great difficulties to production. The cooperative members had to travel thirty or forty *li* to and from the mountain every day to cultivate the land, working before sunrise and after sunset, and still not accomplishing much. According to statistics from more than 200 farm households, more than 1,000 *mu* of land were left uncultivated due to their move down the mountain.

When the great debate on the grain issue was launched in the countryside, the issue of "going up the mountain and down the mountain" was raised in the above-mentioned types of agricultural cooperatives. Some cooperative members said: Most of our land is on the mountain. If people all move down, how can we increase grain production? Some cooperative members said: Mountain land produces potatoes. If we don't plant on the mountain, we can't eat stones instead of potatoes. The Guanting District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the debates in various agricultural cooperatives, summarized the ten great advantages of going up the mountain: less travel to cultivate the land, convenient field management, elimination of wasteland, large-scale accumulation of fertilizer, large-scale pig raising and cattle and sheep grazing, easy implementation of the field responsibility system, good work in mountain closure for afforestation and soil and water conservation, development of diversified economy, and ensuring the completion of the production increase plan. After the great debate, the cooperative members realized that moving down the mountain was wrong. At the same time, the agricultural cooperatives also paid attention to solving some of the difficulties of living on the mountain, such as repairing water cellars to solve the drinking water problem; adjusting houses to solve the housing problem; and implementing the system of contracting work and production to the team and rewarding fertilizer accumulation according to the scattered distribution of residences on the mountain.

After the debate, the cooperative members who had moved down the mountain gradually moved back up the mountain. More than 20 households in the Xingguang Agricultural Cooperative in Guanting District, who originally lived in the valley, also moved up the mountain to live.

　　从山上来　回山上去
　　宕昌县搬到河谷的农民认识上山十大好处
　　陆续搬回山上要把过去丢掉的宝贝找回来
    新华社兰州1日电　宕昌县从高山上搬到河谷村庄来住的农户，经过社会主义大辩论以后，最近又陆续搬回高山原住处去，仅官亭、沙弯等区，搬上山去的就有二百多户，其中还有些原来住在河谷村庄里的农户。
    宕昌县90％的耕地是山地，因此大部分居民住在山上。合作化以后，除了山上农民建立农业社以外，还有一部分合作社是河谷地居民和山上居民联合建立的。在这部分合作社里，山上的居民就不安心在山上居住，认为上山苦，困难多，不如山下居民挣的工分多。他们说，“既然山上山下都能得工分，为什么我们要在山上住？”许多农户就搬下来了。但是，这给生产带来了极大的困难，社员们每天上山种地，来回要走三、四十里路，两头不见太阳，还干不了多少活。按二百多农户统计，由于他们搬下山来，就荒了一千多亩地。
    农村展开粮食问题大辩论时，在上述类型的农业社里就提出了“上山下山”的问题。有的社员说：我们的地大部分在山上，人都下来了，怎样能增产粮食？有的社员说：山地出产洋芋，不种山地，总不能把石头当洋芋吃。中共官亭区委会曾根据各农业社的辩论，总结出上山的十大好处：种地少跑路，田间管理方便，能消灭荒地，能大量积肥，可以大量养猪和放牧牛羊，容易推行田间责任制，能做好封山育林和水土保持工作，能发展多种经济，能保证增产计划的完成。经过大辩论，社员们都认识到下山是不对的。同时各农业社也注意解决在山上居住的某些困难，如补修水窖，解决吃水问题；调整了房子，解决住的困难；根据山上居住分散的情况，实行了包工包产到组和积肥奖励制度。
    经过辩论后，下山居住的社员们就陆续搬上山去。官亭区星光农业社，原来在河谷住的二十多户，也随着搬上山去住。
