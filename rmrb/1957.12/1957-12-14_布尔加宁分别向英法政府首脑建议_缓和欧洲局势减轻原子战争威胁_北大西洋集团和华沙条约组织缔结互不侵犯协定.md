Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 13th: TASS Moscow, December 13th: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Bulganin, wrote a letter to British Prime Minister Macmillan, expressing concern about the current international situation. Bulganin wrote that "We believe that events are developing in a direction that endangers the cause of peace."

Bulganin's letter was delivered to the British Prime Minister on December 11th. The letter was published in Moscow newspapers today.

On behalf of the Soviet government, Bulganin proposed that the Soviet and British governments, together with the US government, undertake obligations not to use atomic and hydrogen weapons, and declare a cessation of all nuclear weapons testing from January 1, 1958, even if only for a period of two or three years.

Bulganin proposed reaching an agreement not to deploy any kind of nuclear weapons in West and East Germany. He pointed out that in addition to this agreement, if an agreement is also reached between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, then the governments of Poland and Czechoslovakia, as they have officially announced, will not produce or deploy nuclear weapons on their territory.

Bulganin proposed that member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and member states of the Warsaw Treaty Organization sign a non-aggression pact, and agree not to take any measures to undermine the independence of countries in the Near and Middle East, and not to resort to force in resolving issues related to the Near and Middle East.

Bulganin suggested taking a series of measures to improve and activate Soviet-British relations and contacts in all fields. Bulganin said that developing normal trade, without attaching any discriminatory restrictions, is in the vital interests of the British and Soviet peoples.

He continued, "We advocate that the Soviet and British countries fully develop peaceful cooperation and competition in science, technology, culture, art, education, and health."

Measures must also be taken to stop all propaganda in newspapers and radio stations that would cause distrust and mutual suspicion.

In his letter, Bulganin drew the British Prime Minister's attention to the fact that many politicians, social activists, and others are increasingly and firmly demanding an end to the arms race and the "Cold War," demanding an early display of wisdom, and demanding that we take the path of peaceful coexistence between countries. He said that if we proceed from the interests of safeguarding world peace, we must affirm with great certainty the coexistence of capitalist and socialist countries in the world today. Bulganin pointed out that we all cannot fail to take into account that all attempts to forcibly change this situation and disrupt the "status quo," and all attempts to forcibly change borders, will lead to tragic consequences.

Bulganin said that the Soviet government cannot fail to remind that now the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are formulating military plans and preparing for war, while at the same time propagating the idea that war is inevitable.

Bulganin said that some people are using the fact that the Soviet Union has intercontinental ballistic missiles, and even the fact that the Soviet Union has launched artificial earth satellites for scientific research, to frighten everyone. To this end, Bulganin reiterated the following facts: the Soviet Union has repeatedly proposed in the past, and still proposes now, to ban all types of nuclear weapons, stop manufacturing nuclear weapons, and completely destroy existing atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and various range rockets with nuclear warheads, including intercontinental rockets.

Bulganin said in his letter that if the Soviet Union is not subjected to aggression, the Soviet government does not intend to use any means of destruction.

Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: According to TASS Moscow, December 12th: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Bulganin, said in a letter to French Prime Minister Gaillard: "We still believe that one of the most important measures that can thoroughly improve the entire international situation, especially the European situation, is to conclude some form of non-aggression pact between member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and member states of the Warsaw Treaty Organization."

Bulganin believes that the conclusion of a non-aggression pact is particularly in line with "the interests of countries such as the Soviet Union and France, because history has proven that these two countries have inevitably been involved in all major military conflicts in Europe."

Bulganin's letter was delivered to the French Prime Minister on the 11th. The letter expressed deep concern about the intensified war preparations by member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

In his letter, Bulganin asked why France does not take the initiative to propose, at the upcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, suggestions aimed at easing international tensions and developing comprehensive peaceful cooperation between countries? Bulganin said that the Soviet Union is willing to support such an initiative and is willing to participate in any form of discussion (including direct contact with representatives of relevant countries) to discuss the most pressing issues of concern to the people of all countries.

Bulganin expressed his belief that, apart from those artificially created contradictions and the consequences of the policy of establishing exclusive military blocs, there are no conflicting interests between the Soviet Union and France. Bulganin pointed out that "whether it is past experience or the lessons of contemporary events, it shows that it is necessary to restore the historically significant friendship between our two countries."

Bulganin said that as for the Soviet Union, it deeply hopes that France will prosper and become strong; it hopes that it will occupy the position due to the great French people among the great powers.

The letter pointed out that the governments of countries possessing nuclear weapons—the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union—should announce their voluntary renunciation of the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons. At the same time, countries can reach an agreement to stop nuclear weapons explosion tests from January 1 next year, even if only suspending them for two or three years. The Soviet government proposed that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union abandon the placement of nuclear weapons in West and East Germany. If such an agreement can be reached, and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany and the government of the German Democratic Republic can also reach an agreement not to produce nuclear weapons and not to place nuclear weapons in Germany, then in this case, the governments of Poland and Czechoslovakia will also, as they have stated, undertake the obligation not to produce and not to place nuclear weapons in their own countries.

Bulganin concluded that in this way, a vast area without nuclear weapons can be established on the eastern border of France—in central Europe, thereby greatly reducing the threat of atomic war.

In order to normalize the situation in the Near and Middle East, Bulganin again suggested in the letter that an agreement be reached on the four countries not taking any actions to undermine the independence of countries in the region and not using force to resolve issues related to the Near and Middle East.

Bulganin requested that international relations necessary for peaceful life, such as international trade, should not be considered from a military point of view. Bulganin emphasized that this is the best and most reliable means of strengthening international trust.

Bulganin also believes that, in order to successfully solve current international problems together, direct contact between leaders of the Soviet Union and Western countries and meetings between representatives of socialist and capitalist countries are of great significance.

    布尔加宁分别向英法政府首脑建议
    缓和欧洲局势减轻原子战争威胁
    北大西洋集团和华沙条约组织缔结互不侵犯协定
    新华社13日讯　塔斯社莫斯科13日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁写信给英国首相麦克米伦。信中对目前的国际局势表示不安。布尔加宁写道，我们认为，事件在向着危害和平事业的方向发展。
    布尔加宁的信是12月11日交给英国首相的。这封信今天在莫斯科各报上发表。
    布尔加宁代表苏联政府建议苏联和英国政府同美国政府共同承担义务不使用原子武器和氢武器，并且宣布从1958年1月1日起停止各种核武器试验，开始时哪怕是为期两三年也好。
    布尔加宁建议就不在西德和东德境内配置任何种类的核武器一事达成协议。他指出，除了这项协定以外，如果德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国之间也达成协议，那末波兰和捷克斯洛伐克政府将像它们正式宣布的那样，不生产和不在本国领土上配置核武器。
    布尔加宁建议北大西洋集团成员国和华沙条约成员国之间签订互不侵犯协定，并且商定不采取任何破坏中近东国家独立的措施，和在解决同中近东有关的问题时不诉诸武力。
    布尔加宁建议采取一系列措施，改善和活跃苏联同英国在各方面的联系和接触。布尔加宁说，发展正常贸易，不附加任何歧视性限制，是符合英苏两国人民的切身利益的。
    他接着说，我们主张苏英两国在科学、技术、文化、艺术、教育和卫生等方面全力展开和平合作和竞赛。
    还必须采取措施，使报纸和电台停止一切会引起互不信任和互相猜疑心情的宣传。
    布尔加宁在信中提请英国首相注意，许多政治家、社会活动家和其他人士都日益坚决地要求结束军备竞赛和“冷战”，要求及早表现明智的态度，要求走各国和平共处的道路。他说，如果从保障世界和平的利益出发，就必须十分肯定地承认今天世界上资本主义国家和社会主义国家并存的局面。布尔加宁指出，我们大家不能不考虑到，想要强行改变这种状况和破坏“现状”的一切企图，想要强行改变疆界的一切企图都会得到悲惨的结局。
    布尔加宁说，苏联政府不能不提醒注意，现在北大西洋公约组织国家一面在制定军事计划和进行备战，一面在宣传战争是不可避免的思想。
    布尔加宁说，有人用苏联有洲际弹道火箭，甚至用苏联为科学研究而发射人造地球卫星这一事实来恫吓大家。为此布尔加宁再次强调指出下列事实，苏联过去曾一再建议，现在仍然建议禁止一切种类的核武器，停止制造核武器和完全销毁现有的原子弹、氢弹和各种射程的带有核弹头的火箭，包括洲际火箭在内。
    布尔加宁在信中又说，如果苏联不受到侵犯，苏联政府就不打算使用任何毁灭手段。
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科12日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在给法国总理盖伊阿的一封信中说：“我们仍旧认为，能够彻底改善整个国际局势、首先是欧洲局势的最重要的措施之一，就是在北大西洋公约组织成员国和华沙条约缔约国之间缔结某种形式的互不侵犯协定。”
    布尔加宁认为，缔结互不侵犯协定特别符合“苏联和法国这样一些国家的利益，因为历史证明，这两个国家曾经不可避免地卷入了欧洲历次大规模的军事冲突”。
    布尔加宁的这封信已经在11日递交给法国总理。信中对北大西洋公约组织成员国变本加厉地进行备战活动表示深切的不安。
    布尔加宁在信中问道，法国为什么不采取主动在即将举行的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议上提出旨在缓和国际紧张局势和发展各国之间的全面和平合作的建议呢？布尔加宁说，苏联愿意支持这种倡议，并且愿意参加任何形式的讨论（包括同有关国家代表直接接触），来商谈各国人民所关心的最迫切的问题。
    布尔加宁表示相信，除了那些人为制造的矛盾、建立排他性军事集团的政策的后果之外，苏法两国没有任何利益的矛盾。布尔加宁指出，“无论是以往的经验或是当代事件的教训，都说明必须恢复我们两国之间有历史意义的友谊”。
    布尔加宁说，至于苏联，它深切希望法国繁荣富强；希望它在大国之间占有伟大的法国人民理所应有的地位。
    信中指出，拥有核武器的国家——美国、英国和苏联政府应当宣布自愿放弃使用原子武器和氢武器。同时各国可以达成协议，从明年1月1日起停止核武器的爆炸试验，那怕暂停两三年也好。苏联政府建议，美国、英国和苏联放弃在西德和东德放置核武器。如果能够达成这种协议，并且德意志联邦共和国政府和德意志民主共和国政府也能够达成不生产核武器和不在德国境内放置核武器的协议，那末在这种情况下，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克政府也会像它们声明过的那样，承担在本国境内不生产和不放置核武器的义务。
    布尔加宁断定说，这样在法国东部边境——在欧洲中部就可以建立广大的无原子武器地区，从而在很大的程度上减轻原子战争的威胁。
    为了使中近东局势正常化，布尔加宁在信中再次建议，就四国不进行任何破坏这个地区各国独立的行动和不使用武力解决有关中近东的问题达成协议。
    布尔加宁要求对和平生活所必需的国际联系，如国际贸易，不要从军事观点出发来考虑。布尔加宁强调说，这是加强国际信任的最好和最可靠的手段。
    布尔加宁还认为，为了顺利地共同解决当前的国际问题，苏联同西方国家领导人的直接接触和社会主义国家同资本主义国家代表的会见具有很大的意义。
