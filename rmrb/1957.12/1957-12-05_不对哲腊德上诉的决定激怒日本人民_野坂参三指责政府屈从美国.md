    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 4th: The "Akahata" newspaper reported today that the Japanese Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office's decision not to appeal the case of American soldier Girard, who committed murder, has aroused widespread and strong dissatisfaction and anger among people of all strata in Japan.
    Nosaka Sanzō, First Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, pointed out that this decision proves that the Japanese prosecutorial authorities are subservient to the United States and have lost their autonomy.
    Nosaka also pointed out that the series of humiliating decisions by the Japanese judicial authorities are a concrete manifestation of the Kishida Nobusuke government's traitorous policy.
    Nosaka said, "We must strongly protest against this attitude of the Japanese government, and at the same time, we must mobilize public opinion and demand the abolition of the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' and 'Administrative Agreement' to eliminate the root of the trouble."
    Nomiya Masaru, Chairman of the National Liaison Council Against Military Bases in Japan, said that the decision of the Japanese prosecutorial authorities proves that the judicial power and autonomy of Japan are only formal. Nomiya Masaru called on the Japanese people to thoroughly investigate the responsibility of the Kishida Nobusuke government.
    Tanabe Makoto, Chairman of the Gunma Prefecture Local Council of Trade Unions of Japan, accused that this is the result of the Japanese prosecutorial authorities succumbing to American political pressure.

    不对哲腊德上诉的决定激怒日本人民
　　野坂参三指责政府屈从美国
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”今天报道，日本最高检察当局决定不对美国兵哲腊德杀人案件提起上诉的决定，引起日本各阶层人民普遍的强烈不满和愤怒。
    日本共产党第一书记野坂参三指出，这个决定证明日本检察当局屈从于美国，并且已经失去了它的自主性。
    野坂还指出，日本司法当局一连串的耻辱性决定是岸信介政府卖国政策的具体表现。
    野坂说，我们要向日本政府的这种态度提出强烈的抗议，同时要动员舆论，要求撤销日美“安全条约”和“行政协定”，来消除祸根。
    日本反对军事基地全国联络会议议长野沟胜说，日本检察当局的这一决定证明日本的裁判权和司法权的自主性只是形式而已。野沟胜号召日本人民彻底追究岸信介政府的责任。
    日本工会总评议会群马县地方评议会议长田边诚指责说，这是日本检察当局屈服于美国政治压力的结果。
