The experience of Gaoyang County in combining agriculture and sideline occupations

    While concentrating its main efforts on water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and winter wheat management, Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, has also developed sideline production. As a result, it has not only solved the current livelihood problems of the masses but also ensured sufficient funds to support water conservancy construction and the fertilizer accumulation movement. The reason why this county has been able to carry out agricultural and sideline production simultaneously in winter is mainly due to the solution of the following problems.
    Overall Arrangement, Strengthened Leadership
    Gaoyang County is a low-lying, flood-prone area that suffered from floods for three consecutive years from 1954 to 1956. Although there were no disasters this year, 43 cooperatives suffered from late water drainage last year, resulting in small sown areas. Some cooperatives even failed to plant crops at all, leading to severe food shortages. These cooperatives must make up for the shortfall by developing sideline production. Therefore, from the very beginning of the winter production campaign, the county party committee considered that if agricultural production did not achieve a leap forward, the county would never be able to overcome the food shortage. However, if only agriculture was considered and sideline production was ignored, not only would the livelihood of the members become a problem, but water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation would also be impossible to carry out, and it would even affect next year's spring plowing. Some township and cooperative cadres, however, believed that engaging in sideline occupations would affect the development of water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation work, while township and cooperative cadres in bumper harvest areas had the idea that they could get by without engaging in sideline occupations. Therefore, the county party committee educated them through meetings and by presenting facts and reasoning in a timely manner, enabling the vast number of township and cooperative cadres to realize that developing sideline production was part of organizing a great leap forward in production, thus strengthening leadership over sideline production. From the county to the cooperative and team levels, there were cadres managing this work at every level. The county party committee also clearly stated that 70% of the labor force in heavily affected cooperatives should be invested in sideline production, 10% in non-affected cooperatives, and 50% in lightly affected cooperatives. Each cooperative has made unified arrangements for agricultural and sideline production and labor in accordance with the spirit of the county party committee. For example, the Dongliuguozhuang Village Agricultural Cooperative allocated all 484 laborers in the cooperative to the two production fronts of agriculture and sideline occupations, determining that 70% of the skilled laborers would engage in sideline occupations, guaranteeing a daily income of 135 yuan, and 30% of the strong laborers would engage in water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, manure delivery, and wheat management. As a result, the completion of agricultural production tasks was guaranteed, and agricultural and sideline production were carried out without hindering each other.
    Taking into Account Both Large and Small, Opening Up Multiple Avenues
    The difficulty in sideline production this year is that there are fewer avenues, and the various business departments have the idea that since there was a good harvest this year, there is no need to engage in sideline occupations anymore. After discovering this problem, the county party committee vigorously implemented the spirit that economic departments should support sideline production, reversing the above ideas and making all departments actively support the development of sideline production. Under the leadership of the party committee, the Gaoyang Processing Station of the Textile Products Company and the County Handicraft Industry Cooperative held a meeting of cadres in charge of sideline production in early December to specifically study the issue of large cloth production, thereby vigorously promoting the development of the weaving industry. The Handicraft Industry Cooperative also sent cadres to Shijiazhuang, Hengshui, Tangshan and other processing units to purchase 50,000 kilograms of broken cloth strips, sweater edges, etc., solving the raw material problem for 18 cotton blanket weaving machines. The County Supply and Marketing Cooperative solved the difficulty of some people being unable to produce due to the lack of reeds by purchasing reeds locally, and sent people to the prefectural cooperative twice to solve the sales problem of saltpeter. The bank also provided timely loans of 3,300 yuan to support the development of sideline production by the masses. When developing sideline production, the policy of "taking into account both large and small, and opening up multiple avenues" was vigorously implemented. In addition to focusing on large-scale sideline production such as weaving and boiling saltpeter, which had raw materials, sales channels, and technology, Gaoyang County did not neglect small-scale sideline production. In the case of insufficient raw materials, the county mobilized the masses to find many production avenues. When there was no hemp for making ropes, the masses were vigorously mobilized to peel cotton stalks. According to incomplete statistics, more than 3,000 kilograms of cotton stalk peel had been peeled by December 20.
    Unified Work Points, Unified Dividends
    If the income of cooperative members engaged in sideline occupations belongs to them personally, the cooperative members engaged in agriculture will have opinions, especially in disaster-stricken cooperatives, where agricultural production will be impossible to carry out. In order to solve this problem, each cooperative adopted the following two methods: one is to deduct money in proportion to record work points for those engaged in sideline occupations; the other is to record work points according to quality and quantity, with bonuses for exceeding the quota. In fact, both of the above methods involve unified work points and unified dividends for agricultural and sideline occupations. In the past, members of the Shangban Village Agricultural Cooperative engaged in sideline occupations on their own, resulting in the failure to achieve labor planning and seriously affecting the development of water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movements. After discussing with the members, the cooperative committee stipulated that a method of deducting money to record work points would be adopted according to the different situations of different people. For example, among the 52 people weaving large cloth, 40% of the total income was handed over to the cooperative to record work points for 32 households with strong labor, high income, and low grain distribution after the autumn harvest; 25% of the total income was handed over to the cooperative to record work points for 13 households with average labor, income, and grain distribution; and 10% of the total income was handed over to the cooperative to record work points for six households with fewer people, less labor, and daily income and food. Each yuan was recorded as one work point, and they participated in the unified distribution of agricultural and sideline occupations. In the past, the income from sideline occupations of the Xiangliankou Village Minli Agricultural Cooperative was also entirely personal. As a result, they did not obey the team's labor allocation, and the cooperative members engaged in agriculture could not get money and felt constrained, so they had opinions and were not enthusiastic about production. After research by the cooperative committee and through consultation with the cooperative members, it was decided that the income from large-scale sideline production such as rubber tire transportation, burning small kilns, and weaving native cloth would all be handed over to the cooperative to record work points, while the income from medium-sized sideline occupations such as sweeping saltpeter would all be handed over to the team to record work points, and the income from small-scale production such as spinning would belong to the cooperative members individually. A pre-payment was made every seven days, and they participated in the unified distribution of agricultural and sideline occupations. As a result, the cooperative members engaged in agricultural and sideline occupations became active in production, with 419 laborers involved in sideline occupations, generating a daily income of 323 yuan. In addition to solving the pocket money of all 1,670 people in the cooperative and the problem of some cooperative members buying grain, more than 4,000 bricks were purchased, 19 waterwheel frames were made, 130 yuan was spent on sinking wells, and some sideline production tools were added. By December 20, more than 9,000 yuan had been accumulated. More than 300 laborers were invested in agriculture, completing the accumulation of 8,500 carts of fertilizer, digging 14 brick wells, irrigating more than 300 mu of wheat fields for the first time, delivering 3,100 carts of manure, and hauling 5,400 carts of soil. In order to stimulate the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members, the Dongliuguozhuang Village Agricultural Cooperative implemented the method of "fixed quota production and excess reward" according to the opinions of the masses, which greatly improved the production enthusiasm of the masses. Of the 98 weaving machines in the cooperative, 96 have been activated, and generally, people weave cloth by hanging lamps in the morning and evening. Among them, 27 double-shift machines have been running day and night. The output and quality have also been greatly improved.

    高阳县农业副业结合的经验
    河北省高阳县在集中主要力量开展水利、积肥和小麦越冬管理的同时，搞起了副业生产，因此，不仅解决了群众目前生活问题，而且还保证了足够的资金支持了水利建设和积肥运动的开展。这个县所以能够做到冬季农、副业生产同时开展，主要是解决了以下几个问题。
    全面安排  加强领导
    高阳县是个低洼易涝地区，从1954年到1956年连续三年遭受水灾。今年仍然无灾，但有四十三个社由于去年撤水较晚，播种面积小，甚至有的社根本就没有种上庄稼，这些社缺粮很多，必须通过开展副业生产来加以弥补，因此，从冬季生产运动一开始，县委就考虑到：如果农业生产上不来个跃进，就永远不能摆脱缺粮状况，但是只顾搞农业忽视了副业生产，不仅社员的生活要成问题，就是水利积肥也无法开展，甚至会影响明年春耕生产。而有些乡、社干部却认为搞副业会影响水利、积肥工作的开展，丰收地区的乡、社干部又有不搞副业也过得去的思想。于是，县委便通过会议及时的摆事实讲道理的方法进行了教育、使广大乡、社干部都认识到了开展副业生产是组织生产大跃进的一部分，因而加强了对副业生产的领导。从县到社、队层层都有干部管理这项工作。县委并明确提出：重灾社投入副业生产的劳力占70％，非灾社投入副业生产的劳力占10％，轻灾社投入副业生产的劳力占50％。各社都根据县委这个精神，对农副业生产与劳力统一进行了安排。如东留果庄村农业社将全社四百八十四名劳力分别配置在农副业两条生产战线上，确定70％的有技术的劳力搞副业，保证了每日收入一百三十五元，30％的壮劳力搞水利、积肥、送粪和小麦管理。这样，安排的结果，保证了农业生产任务的完成，作到了农副业生产两不误。
    大小兼顾　广开门路
    今年副业生产中的困难是门路较少，而各企业部门又存有今年丰收了不须要再搞副业的思想，县委查觉到这一问题后，便大力贯彻了经济部门要支持副业生产的精神，扭转以上思想，使各部门积极支持副业生产的开展。纺织品公司高阳加工站和县手工业联社，在党委的领导下，于12月初召开了负责副业生产的干部会，专门对大布生产问题作了研究，从而有力地推动了织布业的开展。手工业联社并派出干部到石家庄、衡水、唐山等地加工单位收购了五万斤破碎布条子、绒衣边等，解决了十八台织棉毯机子的原料问题。县供销社通过就地收购坑苇，解决了部分群众因无苇不能生产的困难，并两次派人到专区社联系解决了皮硝的销路问题。银行也及时贷出了三千三百元的贷款，支持群众副业生产的开展；开展副业生产时，大力贯彻了“大小兼顾、广开门路”的方针。高阳县除突出地抓住了有原料、有销路、有技术的织布、熬火硝等大宗副业生产外，同时，对小宗副业生产也没有忽视，在原料不足的情况下，发动群众找到了很多生产门路。打绳没麻，就大力发动群众剥棉秸皮，据不完全统计到12月20日已剥棉秸皮三千多斤。
    统一记工　统一分红
    社员搞副业的收入如果归个人所有，搞农业的社员就会有意见，特别是受灾社，农业生产就会无法进行。为了解决这个问题各社采取了以下两个办法：一个是搞副业的按比例抽钱记工；一个是按质按量记工，超额奖励。以上两种办法实际都是农副业统一记工统一分红。商板村农业社在以前由于社员搞副业自搞自有，致使劳力规划不能实现，严重地影响着水利，积肥运动的开展，该社社委会同社员商量后，规定了根据不同人的不同情况，采取了抽款记工的办法。例如，织大布的五十二个人中，对其中劳力强、收入大、秋后分粮少的三十二户，抽总收入的40％交社记工；对劳力、收入、分粮一般的十三户抽总收入的25％记工，对人少劳力少日挣日食的六户抽总收入的10％记工，每一元记一个工，参加农副业统一分红。湘连口村民利农业社以前搞副业的收入也是全部归个人，由于这样，他们不服从队里的劳力支配，搞农业的社员分不到款，手头感到死巴，因此，有意见，生产不积极，经过社委会研究，并通过和社员们商量，确定：胶皮车搞运输、烧小窑、织土布等大型副业生产收入、全部交社记工，中型副业：如扫皮硝等副业全部归队记工，纺线等小型生产收入归社员个人，实行每七天一预支，参加农副业的统一分红，这样，搞农副业的社员生产都积极了，投入副业的劳力达四百一十九人，日收益三百二十三元，除解决了全社一千六百七十个人的零花钱和部分社员买粮外，还买了四千多块砖，打水车架子十九个，锥井花了一百三十元，添置了一部分副业工具，到12月20日还积累下九千多元。投入农业的劳力达三百多人，完成积肥八千五百车、打砖井十四眼，三百多亩麦田还浇了头水，送出粪三千一百车，拉土五千四百车。东留果庄村农业社为了激发社员的生产积极性，根据群众的意见实行了“定额生产、超额奖励”的办法，更大大提高了群众的生产积极性，全社九十八张织布机，已有九十六台活动了起来，一般作到了早晚挂灯织布，其中还有二十七台双班机子都达到了昼夜不停。产量质量也都有很大提高。
