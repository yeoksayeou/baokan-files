Physical Labor is the Inevitable Path for Intellectuals' Ideological Remolding
Beijing Petroleum Institute Students Launch an Ideological Debate and Achieve Important Gains

(Our Dispatch) Beijing Petroleum Institute recently launched a school-wide debate on physical labor, which has been a vivid lesson in socialist ideological education.

The Question is Raised

This semester, Beijing Petroleum Institute organized more frequent voluntary labor. Most students actively participated, but many felt that engaging in voluntary labor was a waste of time. In addition, many students had ideological disagreements with cadres and intellectuals going to the countryside to participate in productive labor, and university graduates directly participating in industrial and agricultural production labor, exposing a lot of thinking that belittled workers and peasants and belittled labor. At that time, the school Party committee believed that clarifying this issue through debate among students was of great significance for cultivating a new type of working-class intellectual. Therefore, a mass debate on participating in physical labor was launched at the Beijing Petroleum Institute.

Mobilizing the Masses to Expose Thoughts

At the beginning of the debate, a difficulty was encountered: the masses were afraid to boldly expose their thoughts. In order to solve this problem, Party and Youth League organizations, through various means such as general meetings, radio broadcasts, and school publications, repeatedly emphasized to the masses that the debate on participating in physical labor was an internal matter of the people, and was a contradiction of a fundamentally different nature from the struggle against the rightists. Everyone could only improve their ideological awareness by boldly exposing their thoughts, putting forward arguments, and launching debates. Many Youth League branches also discussed issues such as "Is it necessary to expose thoughts?" in response to specific problems in their classes, dispelling the concerns of Youth League members. At the same time, Party and Youth League organizations also provided individual assistance to some students, repeatedly mobilizing them to boldly expose their thoughts. For cadres, the institute leaders focused on mobilizing them to participate in the debate as debaters, helping them to recognize that the process of the debate was also a process of their ideological remolding, emphasizing that key members should take the lead, first by exposing their thoughts realistically and actively participating in the debate. After the cadres' thinking was clarified, the atmosphere in the classes greatly improved, and even the people who usually didn't like to talk spoke their minds. Everyone exposed their thoughts and actively participated in the debate, and the debate unfolded enthusiastically.

Choosing Good Debate Topics

After the masses' concerns were basically eliminated, all kinds of arguments were exposed among the students. At the beginning, some people proposed that participating in physical labor was the only way for intellectuals to remold their ideology, but this argument was quickly refuted. In the process of refuting this argument, two different opinions emerged: one was that participating in physical labor was the necessary path for the current ideological remolding of intellectuals; the other was that there were multiple paths for the current ideological remolding of intellectuals, and it was not necessarily necessary to participate in labor. They insisted that theoretical study played a decisive role in the ideological remolding of intellectuals. Others emphasized that as long as a person had the subjective desire to improve their ideology, they could improve it regardless of which path they took. Labor was only a means, a way, which could be used or not.

At this time, many topics were presented to everyone. The institute Party committee selected a topic from the questions raised by the masses that they were most concerned about and that was enlightening, specific, and able to reflect the essence of the problem: "Is physical labor the inevitable path for the current ideological remolding of intellectuals?" After this topic was raised, a debate upsurge quickly formed.

The Debate Unfolds

In the process of heated debate, the "inevitable path" faction and the "non-inevitable path" faction quickly formed. Initially, quite a few people supported the "non-inevitable path" faction, and the "non-inevitable path" faction also organized a group of people with the same arguments to prepare separately, brewing and discussing. Their arguments became more systematic and complete, so they dared to stick to their opinions. In the early stage, the "non-inevitable path" faction had always been in the upper hand. During this period, the speeches of the "inevitable path" faction did not match the arguments of the "non-inevitable path" faction, and seemed empty and weak, like making small reports. After losing several battles, the students of the "inevitable path" faction also organized themselves into several groups, preparing rebuttals against the specific arguments of the "non-inevitable path" faction. They actively studied documents, collected practical materials, and looked for various reference books to arm themselves, so their arguments became full and powerful.

At the debate, representatives from both the "inevitable path" faction and the "non-inevitable path" faction took the stage to speak. When the speeches were wonderful, they often won applause from their supporters. There were often many people offstage who raised questions and rebuttals with notes, forming a situation of mutual response between the stage and the audience. After repeated debates two or three times, the opinions of the "inevitable path" faction became more and more powerful, completely gaining the upper hand, and fewer and fewer people insisted on the "non-inevitable path" faction, losing the battle.

The Gains of the Debate

After many large and small debates, most students felt that they had gained a lot ideologically.

First of all, everyone felt that the assessment of the current state of intellectuals was clearer, realizing that the saying that "the position problem of most students has been basically solved" was incorrect. Many students said, "We college students lack the workers' and peasants' hatred for the enemy, and our trust in and love for the Party is also not enough. On the contrary, we look down on workers and peasants and have distance from them." Thus, they realized the necessity for intellectuals to betray their original class position and remold their ideology. Secondly, everyone also clarified that intellectuals must be transformed into working-class intellectuals, and it is not enough to only ask to be a patriotic scientist. They must take the road of integrating with workers and peasants, put down the airs of intellectuals, and thoroughly remold their original class position and class feelings. Thirdly, everyone also realized that the current historical period is different from the era of Lu Xun. At that time, revolutionary intellectuals participated in the revolutionary movements of workers and peasants, thereby gaining remolding. However, the main content of the current revolutionary movement is to build socialism, so current intellectuals must devote themselves to the labor of building socialism in order to integrate with workers and peasants and gain remolding. Many students also initially realized that physical labor cannot be replaced by other methods for ideological remolding.

After a month and a half of debate, most students have realized the importance of participating in physical labor, feeling that the direction is clear, the path is specific, the confidence in remolding is enhanced, and the enthusiasm for participating in voluntary labor is also improved.

    体力劳动是知识分子思想改造必经之路
    北京石油学院学生展开思想大辩论取得重要收获
    本报讯　北京石油学院最近在全校学生中开展了关于体力劳动的大辩论，这是生动的社会主义思想教育的一课。
    问题提出来
    这学期北京石油学院组织了较经常的义务劳动，大部分学生积极参加了，但不少学生认为搞义务劳动浪费时间。另外，许多学生对干部和知识分子下乡参加劳动生产，大学毕业生直接参加工农业生产劳动等问题，思想上也搞不通，暴露出来不少轻视工农、轻视劳动的思想。当时，学校党委认为在学生中辩论清楚这一问题，对培养新型的工人阶级知识分子有着极重要的意义。因此，在北京石油学院里掀起了一场关于参加体力劳动的群众性的大辩论。
    发动群众暴露思想
    辩论开始，首先遇到了一个困难：群众不敢大胆暴露思想。为了解决这个问题，党和团的组织通过大会动员、广播、校刊等多种方式，在群众中反复强调了关于参加体力劳动的大辩论是人民内部的问题，和反右派斗争是两种根本不同性质的矛盾，每个人只有大胆暴露思想，摆出论点，开展辩论才能提高思想觉悟。不少共青团支部还针对班上的具体问题讨论了“有必要暴露思想吗？”等问题，解除了团员的顾虑。同时，党和团的组织还对一些学生进行了个别帮助，反复动员他们大胆暴露思想。对于干部，院领导上着重动员他们以一个辩论者的身份参加辩论，帮助他们认识大辩论的过程，也是他们思想改造的过程，强调提出骨干分子带头，首先是实事求是的暴露思想积极参加辩论会。干部思想明确以后，大大扭转了班上的气氛，连平时最不爱说话的人也谈出了心里的话。大家纷纷暴露思想，积极投入了辩论，争论热烈地展开了。
    选择好辩论的题目
    群众顾虑基本解除以后，学生中形形色色的论点都暴露出来了。开始时，有人提出参加体力劳动是知识分子思想改造唯一的方法，这论点很快被驳倒了。在驳斥这一论点的过程中，出现了两种不同的意见：一种是认为参加体力劳动是当前知识分子思想改造的必经道路；一种是认为当前知识分子思想改造的道路是多条的，不一定非参加劳动不可。他们坚持：理论学习对知识分子的思想改造起决定作用。还有人强调一个人只要主观上有改造好思想的愿望，不管通过那条道路都能改造好，劳动只是一种手段，一种方式，可以通过它，也可以不通过它。
    这时，在大家面前摆出了很多题目，院党委从群众提出的问题中选择了一个群众最关心又带有启发性，既具体，又能反映问题实质的题目，——“体力劳动是不是当前知识分子思想改造的必经之途”。这个题目提出来以后，辩论热潮很快就形成了。
    辩论展开了
    “必经派”和“非必经派”在热烈的争论过程中，很快地形成了两派，起初拥护“非必经派”的人相当多，“非必经派”还组织了一批和他们论点相同的人分头作准备，酝酿、讨论，他们的论点更系统更完整了，所以他们敢于坚持自己的意见。在初期，“非必经派”一直占了上风，这时期，“必经派”的讲话和“非必经派”的论点对不准口径，仿佛作小报告，显得空洞无力。打了几次败仗以后，“必经派”的学生也组织起来，分成几个小组，针对“非必经派”的具体论点准备反驳。他们主动地钻研文件，收集实际材料，找各种参考书，武装自己，这样他们的论据就充分有力了。
    在辩论会上，“必经派”和“非必经派”都有代表上台发言，当发言精彩时往往赢得拥护者的掌声。台下常有许多人用字条提出质问和反驳，形成台上、台下相互呼应的局面。经过反复辩论两三次以后，“必经派”的意见愈辩愈有力，完全占了上风，坚持“非必经派”的人愈来愈少，输下阵来。
    辩论的收获
    经过多次的大小型辩论会以后，大多数学生感到思想上收获很大。
    首先，大家对当前知识分子面貌的估计感到更清楚了，认识到“多数学生目前立场问题已经基本上解决了”这种说法是不对的。许多学生说，“我们大学生缺乏工农对敌人的恨，对党的信任和热爱也很不够，相反地却看不起工农，有距离”。从而认识到知识分子背叛原来阶级立场、改造思想的必要性。其次，大家还明确了知识分子必须改造成为工人阶级知识分子，只要求作一个爱国的科学家是不成的。必须走和工农结合的道路，放下知识分子的架子，彻底改造自己原有的阶级立场和阶级感情。第三，大家还认识到目前的历史时期，和鲁迅的时代是不同的。那时的革命知识分子参加工农的革命运动，从而得到了改造，可是当前革命运动的主要内容是建设社会主义，所以当前知识分子要投身于建设社会主义的劳动中，才能和工农结合，才能得到改造。许多学生还初步体会到体力劳动对思想改造是其他方式所不能代替的。
    经过一个半月的辩论，大多数学生已经认识到参加体力劳动的重要意义，感到方向明确了，道路具体了，改造的信心增强了，参加义务劳动的热情也提高了。　（刘彬）
