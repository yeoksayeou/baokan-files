Good Labor at the Foot of Tian Shou Mountain
——A Record of Labor Education at Beijing No. 83 Middle School
By our reporter Dai Yue
　　At the foot of Tian Shou Mountain in Changping District, the capital, stands a school building with beautiful scenery – Beijing No. 83 Middle School. Currently, one thousand and sixty-two students are studying happily here.
　　This beautiful school was originally a dilapidated old temple, surrounded by tombs, with only a few households nearby. After liberation, in order to take care of rural children attending middle school, the government built the school on these ruins. In 1953, the school had only two rows of classrooms and more than three hundred students, without even a toilet. The yard was uneven, and the whole yard was flooded when it rained, leaving students with no place to move around. Students had to climb slopes and detour around pits when going to class, and they would step into mud pits if they were not careful when going out in the evening.
　　Teachers assigned here were not content with their work; students who were admitted to this school were also dissatisfied with the environment. The school work was chaotic, and student discipline was poor. In early 1953, the Education Section of the Tongxian Special District of Hebei Province sent Comrade Xue Tian to serve as the school principal. He was not daunted by the difficulties he faced.
　　In the spring of 1954, Principal Xue and the teachers studied the school building work together. Based on the situation at the time, the only way to change the school environment was to mobilize all teachers and students to take action. However, some teachers and students did not agree with this idea. Some teachers said: We are here to teach, not to participate in labor; some students said: We are here to learn culture, not to be slaves for the school. Principal Xue conducted revolutionary tradition education among all teachers and students in response to this wrong thinking, and influenced others with practical actions. When it came to school construction labor, he always carried the largest basket of soil and did the heaviest work; in terms of professional work, in addition to undertaking the administrative work of the principal, he also served as the head teacher of two classes and took charge of political classes for one class. Therefore, he worked from five or six in the morning until eleven or twelve at night every day. The principal's selfless working spirit greatly moved the teachers and students and inspired the labor enthusiasm of all teachers and students, and no one complained anymore.
　　This school, with an area of ​​nearly 3.2 million square meters, except for the classrooms and dormitories built by workers, the ancillary facilities, playground, toilets, gardens, leveled yard, greening, etc. were all built by teachers and students themselves. Through school construction labor, students developed labor habits and established correct labor concepts.
　　Student participation in physical labor has become a common practice. During extracurricular activities, students can be seen everywhere automatically chopping the wood used for heating in winter into pieces and sweeping the yard. Female students sew clothes, mend socks, and help cooks wash dishes and vegetables. Each class has a fertilizer pit. After dinner, students take manure baskets everywhere to pick up manure and collect grass for fertilizer, which is used for the school's garden or sent to the agricultural cooperative. In this school, the slogan "Do one good thing for the collective" can be heard everywhere, and practical actions of "Do one good thing for the collective" can be seen everywhere. For example, in order to respond to the country's call for diligence and thrift in running schools, the coal briquettes used for heating in winter were made by the students in their spare time. This alone saved the country more than 120 yuan in labor costs.
　　Students also regularly participate in some social labor. The school has established close ties with agricultural cooperatives. When the agricultural cooperatives have a lot of work and are too busy, they notify the school to support them, and students often go to the agricultural cooperatives to participate in labor. During the high tide of agricultural cooperation, the neighboring Jingwentun Agricultural Cooperative of No. 83 Middle School dug canals, but the labor force was insufficient, so more than 1,000 teachers and students from the entire school braved the heavy snow to help the agricultural cooperative dig canals. This autumn, the rice on both sides of the canals was harvested abundantly, and the agricultural cooperative invited the students to be guests, and the members cordially entertained them. Through this incident, the students received practical education and truly realized the superiority of agricultural cooperation.
　　Most of the students here are from rural areas, and most of them rely on scholarships to attend school. In the past, each class spent an average of about 120 yuan per month on scholarships. After several years of labor training, the students have established a correct labor attitude. Therefore, in the past one or two years, more than 70% of the students in the school have gone to cities or agricultural cooperatives to work during the winter and summer vacations, and some students have contracted the school's toilets and some simple odd jobs. These students who participate in labor earn an average of 40 to 50 yuan per year, which can solve personal tuition and living expenses. Students automatically do not want scholarships, so scholarships have been reduced by about 50% compared with the past.
　　Labor education has laid a good foundation for students to participate in production labor in the future. This summer vacation, more than 20% of the students in No. 83 Middle School who did not go on to higher education happily participated in agricultural production.

　　天寿山麓好劳动
　　——记北京八十三中的劳动教育
　　本报记者　戴月
    在首都昌平区天寿山脚下，有一所风景秀丽的校舍——北京八十三中学。现在，有一千零六十二名学生在这里愉快的学习。
    这所幽美的学校原来是一座破烂不堪的老爷庙，周围是坟墓，附近只有几家住户。解放后，政府为了照顾农村子弟上中学，就在这个废墟上建设了学校。1953年学校只有两排教室和三百多名学生，连个厕所也没有。院子里坑洼不平，一下雨满院子是水，学生也没有活动的地方。上课时学生要爬岗绕坑，晚间出门时稍不注意脚就会踩在泥坑里。
    被分配到这里来的教师不安心工作；考到这个学校来的学生也不满意这里的环境。学校工作很混乱，学生纪律也不好。1953年初，河北省通县专区教育科派薛天同志到这里来担任校长工作，他并没有被眼前的困难吓倒。
    1954年春，薛校长和教师一起研究建校工作，根据当时情况，只有发动全体师生动手改变学校环境。可是有一部分师生思想不通。有的教师说：我们是来教书的，不是来参加劳动的；有的学生说：我们是来学文化的，不是来给学校当奴隶的。薛校长针对这种错误思想在全体师生中进行革命传统教育，并且以实际行动影响别人。当建校劳动的时候，他总是用最大的筐抬土，作最重的活；在业务工作方面，他除了担负校长的行政工作以外，还担任了两个班的班主任工作，担负一个班的政治课。因此，他每天从早晨五、六点钟工作到晚上十一、二点钟。校长这样忘我的工作精神，使教师学生都很受感动，鼓舞了全体师生的劳动热情，再也没有人发牢骚了。
    这所面积近三百二十万平方公尺的学校，除了教室和宿舍是工人盖的以外，附属设备、操场、厕所、园地、平整院子、绿化等等都是师生自己建设的。经过建校劳动，学生们养成了劳动习惯，树立了正确的劳动观念。
    学生参加体力劳动已经形成了风气。在课外活动时间里，到处可以看到学生们自动的把冬天升火用的木头劈成碎片，扫院子。女同学们缝衣服、补袜子、帮助厨师洗碗、洗菜，每个班都有一个积肥坑，同学们吃过晚饭就拿着粪筐到处拾粪、拾草积肥，供学校园地用或者送给农业社。在这所学校里，到处可以听到“为集体作好一件事”的口号，到处可以看到“为集体作好一件事”的实际行动。例如他们为了响应国家勤俭办学的号召，冬天取暖用的煤球就是同学们在课余时间作的，仅这一项就给国家节省工钱一百二十多元。
    同学们还经常参加一些社会劳动。学校和农业社建立起了密切的关系，农业社活多忙不过来时，就通知学校支援他们，学生经常到农业社参加劳动。在农业合作化高潮时，八十三中的邻居——井文屯农业社开水渠，劳动力不够，全校一千多名师生冒着大雪去帮助农业社开水渠。今年秋天，渠道两旁的水稻得到丰收，农业社请学生们去作客，社员亲切地招待他们。通过这件事情，同学们受到一次实际教育，真正体会到了农业合作化的优越性。
    这里的学生大部分是来自农村，多数学生靠助学金上学，过去每月每班平均支出助学金一百二十元左右。经过几年来的劳动锻炼，学生树立了正确的劳动态度，因此，近一两年在寒暑假期间，全校有70％以上的学生到城市或到农业社里作工，还有些学生把学校的厕所和一些简单的杂活包下来。这些参加劳动的学生，每人每年平均收入四、五十元，可以解决个人学费和生活费用，学生自动不要助学金，因此助学金比过去降低了50％左右。
    劳动教育给学生将来参加生产劳动打下了良好的基础。今年暑假，八十三中20％以上没有升学的学生都愉快的参加了农业生产。
