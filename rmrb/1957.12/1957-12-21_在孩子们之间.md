    Among Children
    Di Bai
    Five-year-old Mingming and three-year-old Pingping are always quarreling. They often fight over a cloth doll, an empty oil can, or even a piece of paper, both of them red-faced, shouting loudly: "Mine! Mine!"
    The children weren't like this before. Pingping stayed with her grandmother in her hometown for more than a year. Mingming missed Pingping very much and often said, "When will Pingping come back? It would be so nice to play with Pingping!" Sure enough, when Pingping came back, they were extremely affectionate. Mingming gave all his toys and picture books to Pingping to play with. After two months, the situation gradually changed, and they quarreled and fought over toys more fiercely day by day. What's going on? When did the concept of "Mine! Mine!" stubbornly take root in the children's young minds?
    One night, the quarrel started again. Mingming angrily snatched a picture book from Pingping and said, "This is mine... Mom bought this for me!" Pingping couldn't win and cried aggrievedly. A little later, Mingming was concentrating on building a small house, putting a cloth doll inside. When Mingming wasn't paying attention, Pingping grabbed the cloth doll and ran away, shouting, "This is mine, Grandma made this for me!" She plunged into her grandmother's arms. They were each playing on a bed, teasing each other while playing: "I have a toy car, building blocks..., you don't!" "I have colored clay, picture books..., you don't!" They crawled into bed and still raised their heads to argue face to face. Pingping said, "I have a grandma!" Mingming didn't show weakness either, saying, "I have a mom! And I have a dad!"
    The children's last few words of argument suddenly enlightened me, and I gradually understood what was going on.
    When Pingping first came back, I liked her very much. As time went on, I began to feel that she had been spoiled by her grandmother, liked to be pampered, was picky about food, and didn't listen to me very much. I felt that Pingping was not as likable as Mingming. I often took Mingming out alone to see a movie or buy something. Grandma, on the other hand, always felt that Pingping was wronged, so she secretly stuffed biscuits and candies for Pingping. I favored Mingming, and Grandma favored Pingping. There was a gap between the adults, and from then on, the children couldn't play together. At first, when they were grabbing toys, I patiently said a few words, but later I became impatient and thought of a simple solution: "You play separately! No one is allowed to take anyone else's things from now on!" This not only didn't solve the problem, but made the quarreling more and more fierce.
    That night, I explained this to Grandma and discussed with Grandma to set an example ourselves, treat each child fairly and reasonably in all aspects of life, and not be partial. We should have a consistent attitude towards the children's shortcomings and try to guide the children to consciously recognize their mistakes.
    One Sunday, I remodeled an old wooden box into a toy and book box, and also pasted some colored pictures on the outside. I asked Mingming and Pingping to find their hidden toys and books, sort them out, and put them in. I asked them, "Whose are these toys and books?" "Mine!" "Mine!" they answered抢着. I shook my head and said, "No! They are everyone's. These toys and books were bought by Mom and Dad for the three of you (there is also a one-year-old younger brother) to play with. Whoever wants to play can take them, and they must be put back after playing. The older brother is older, so he should look after the toy box and help his younger sister play. When Pingping grows up a little, she will also take turns looking after the toy box. Do you think this is good?" "Good!" they both answered in unison, and quickly started to put the toys and picture books neatly into a common toy box.
    From then on, the children rarely quarreled. They played together harmoniously, no longer grabbing toys. Mingming sometimes even acted like an older brother, seriously telling Pingping the stories in the picture books. As they played, they often burst into bursts of clear laughter.

    在孩子们之间
    荻白
    五岁的男孩明明和三岁的女孩萍萍，总是在一起吵个不停。他们常常为了互相争夺一个布娃娃，空油盒，甚至是一张纸，两个人都涨红了脸，大声叫嚷：“我的！我的！”
    以前，孩子们可不是这个样子。萍萍跟奶奶回老家住了一年多，明明很想萍萍，常常念叨说：“萍萍多咱回来呀？我跟萍萍一块玩多好！”果然，萍萍回来的时候，他们俩亲热得了不得，明明把玩具和小人书全送给萍萍玩。过了两个月，情况渐渐变了，他俩一天比一天凶地吵闹和争夺玩具。这是怎么回事呢？“我的！我的！”这个概念什么时候顽强地扎在孩子们幼小的头脑里去的呢？
    一天晚上，吵闹又开始了。明明气呼呼地从萍萍手里抢下来一本小人书，说：“这是我的……这是妈妈给我买的！”萍萍争不过就委曲地哭了。一会儿，明明正专心一意地搭小屋，里边放个布娃娃。萍萍乘明明不注意的当儿，一把抱走了布娃娃，一边跑一边嚷：“这是我的，这是奶奶给我做的。”一头扎进奶奶的怀里。他俩一人在一个床上玩，一边玩一边不住地挑逗：“我有小汽车、小积木……，你没有！”“我有五色土、小人书……，你没有！”他俩钻进被窝还仰起头来对着脸打嘴仗。萍萍说：“我有奶奶哪！”明明也不示弱地说：“我有妈妈！我还有爸爸！”
    孩子们最后几句争吵的话，使我的脑子突然明亮了一下，慢慢地我想清楚这是怎么回事了。
    萍萍刚回来，我挺喜欢她。日子长了，我开始觉得她跟奶奶惯了，好撒娇，吃饭时挑这拣那，也不大听我的话，我从心里觉得萍萍不如明明讨人喜欢。我常单独带着明明出去看个电影或买点东西。奶奶呢，老觉着萍萍受了委屈，就偷偷地塞点饼干、糖果给萍萍。我袒护明明，奶奶袒护萍萍，在大人中间有了一条沟，从此孩子们也玩不到一块了。起先，当他们抢玩具时，我还耐心地说几句，后来就不大耐烦了，想了一个简单的办法：“你们分开玩！以后谁也不许拿谁的东西！”这不但不能解决问题，反而吵得愈来愈凶了。
    这天晚上，我把这个道理讲给奶奶听，和奶奶商量好要自己做出榜样，在生活的各个方面公平合理地对待每个孩子，不偏爱。对孩子的缺点要有一致的态度，尽量诱导孩子自觉地认识错误。
    一个星期天，我把旧木箱改制成一个玩具和图书箱子，外面还贴了一些彩色图片。我叫明明和萍萍把自己藏的玩具和图书找出来，整理好，放进去。我问他们：“这些玩具和图书是谁的？”“是我的！”“是我的！”他俩抢着回答。我摇着头说：“不对！是大家的。这些玩具和图书是爸爸妈妈买给你们三个人（还有一个一周岁的小弟弟）玩的。谁玩谁拿，玩完了一定放回去。哥哥年纪大，要看着玩具箱，帮助妹妹玩。等萍萍长大一点，也轮班看着玩具箱。你们说这样好不好？”“好！”他俩都齐声回答，并且很快地动起手来，把玩具和小人书整齐地放到一个公有的玩具箱里去了。
    从此，孩子之间很少吵闹了。他们融洽地在一起玩着，再也不抢玩具了，明明有时还摆着一副哥哥的模样，认真地给萍萍讲小人书上的故事。他们玩着，玩着，常常发出一阵阵清脆的笑声。
