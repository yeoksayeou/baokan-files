    Enriching Children's Lives
    Chen Qimin
    The environment children live in from an early age is the family, and they are particularly fond of and familiar with everything about the family. As children grow up, they gradually become interested in things outside the family, always wanting to see this and see that, asking to know more. This is a manifestation of children's desire for knowledge, and it also shows that children are interested in things in life. Parents should pay attention to this manifestation of children, broaden their horizons, and enrich their lives.
    There are many ways to enrich the content of children's lives. In the family, various activities can be organized: such as providing children with appropriate toys to play with, telling them stories, teaching children to draw, taking children to plant flowers and plants, and also taking children out for outings and visits, etc. These activities must be suitable for the children's age characteristics and should take into account their level of acceptance.
    Here, I will talk about how to take children out for outings.
    On Sundays, when parents are on vacation, children can go out with their parents to see and learn many new and interesting things, leaving a deep impression, and they will often recall them later. At the same time, it is of great benefit to their physical health and intellectual development.
    Where should parents take their children? During holidays, taking children to the park is a very good environment. Children come into contact with the beautiful natural world in the park. Through the correct guidance of their parents, children can appreciate the beauty and loveliness of nature, and cultivate their interest in nature. During the outing, children's attention can be drawn to the scenery of the four seasons. In spring, observe the newly grown buds on the trees; in summer, appreciate various flowers and plants; in autumn, explain to the children why the leaves of the trees have fallen; why the scenery changes in winter, and so on. Playing in the children's playground for a while is also something that children are interested in.
    The zoo is also a place that children like. Under the guidance of adults, they can directly and carefully observe the appearance characteristics of various animals, and leave a correct and profound impression of their images. After seeing various animals, it can help children understand the animals mentioned in pictures or stories, such as tigers, elephants, foxes, wolves, etc.
    Taking children to parks or zoos not only enriches knowledge, but is also an effective means of cultivating children's love for the motherland.
    Taking children to the streets is also a good opportunity to enrich children's knowledge and make them aware of social phenomena. For example, when taking children for a walk on the street, you can tell them which side pedestrians should walk on, how to cross the road, how traffic police direct vehicles and pedestrians, and so on. These are all very ordinary things, but they are fresh and need to be learned for children. More importantly, through these, children can be educated to abide by public order and social morality, and develop the habit of consciously abiding by discipline.
    Parents should not let their children run wild when taking them to the streets. For example, on Sunday, the children happily go out with their parents, but the parents are always busy buying things for themselves, and they have walked through several streets without paying attention to the children. The children see some interesting things, but the parents are very unconcerned or even interrupt or stop them. The children's requests are not met, so they have to follow their parents aimlessly. Even if they see some new things in the future, they will not care about them. In this way, children will feel that there is no gain in going out, which will affect their desire for knowledge.
    The places where children are taken should be places that are good for them and can enrich their knowledge, and the content that children can understand should be selected. For example, when parents are looking for a tailor shop, they can take them to see the situation of the sewing workers and tell them how the worker uncles sew the cloth into a new piece of clothing. When children know how clothes are made, they will cherish their clothes more and respect the labor of the worker uncles more.

    丰富孩子的生活
    陈其敏
    孩子从小生活的环境是家庭，他们对家庭的一切是特别的亲切和熟悉。孩子慢慢地长大了，逐渐地对家庭以外的事也发生了兴趣，他们总想看看这个、看看那个，要求知道更多的事情。这是孩子求知欲的表现，同时也说明孩子对生活中的事物感到了兴趣。父母要重视孩子这种表现，扩大他们的眼界，丰富孩子们的生活。
    要丰富孩子生活的内容，办法很多。在家庭里，可以组织各种活动：如供给孩子适当的玩具作游戏，给他们讲故事，教孩子画画，带孩子种植花草，也可以带孩子出外游玩和参观等等。这些活动都必须适合孩子的年龄特点，要考虑到他们接受的程度。
    这里谈谈怎样带孩子出外游玩。
    星期日父母休假了，孩子们跟着父母出外，可以看到和知道许多新的有趣的东西，留下深刻的印象，以后还会经常回忆起来。同时，对他们的身体健康和智力发展都是有很大好处的。
    父母带孩子上哪里去呢？在休假日，带孩子去公园是很好的环境。孩子在公园里和优美的自然界接触，通过父母的正确指导，孩子们可以体会到自然界的美丽、可爱，培养他们对大自然的兴趣。在出游的过程中，可以启发孩子注意四季的景象。在春季，观察树上新长出来的嫩芽；夏天欣赏各种花草；秋天给孩子们讲解为什么树的叶子落了；冬季的景色为什么变了等等。到儿童游戏场上玩一会，也是孩子们感到兴趣的事。
    动物园也是孩子喜欢的地方。他们在成年人指导下能直接的、仔细的观察各种动物的外形特征，对它们的形象留下正确而深刻的印象。看了各种动物，可以帮助孩子理解图片上或故事中讲到的动物，譬如老虎、象、狐狸、狼等。
    带孩子上公园或动物园等地方去，不但可以丰富知识，同时还是培养孩子热爱祖国的有效手段。
    带孩子上街，也是丰富孩子的知识，使孩子认识社会现象的良好机会。例如，带孩子在街上走，可以告诉孩子行人应该在那边走，怎样过马路，交通警察怎样指挥着车辆和行人，等等。这些都是极平常的事，但是对孩子们来说是新鲜的、需要学习的。更重要的是通过这些可以教育孩子遵守公共秩序和社会道德，养成自觉的遵守纪律的习惯。
    父母们带孩子上街不能放任不管。例如，星期日孩子高高兴兴地跟着父母出去了，但是父母们老是忙着给自己买东西，走遍了几条街也没有理孩子。孩子看到了一些有兴趣的东西，但是父母很不关心甚至打断或阻拦他们。孩子的要求没有满足，只好无目的地跟着父母走，以后他们虽然看到了一些新事物也毫不关心了。这样孩子会感到出去了没有什么收获，以致影响了他们求知的欲望。
    带孩子去的地方，应该是对孩子有好处的、能丰富知识的地方，而且要选择孩子所能理解的内容。如父母要去找缝衣店时，可以带他们去看看缝纫工人的情形，告诉他们工人叔叔怎样把布缝成一件新衣服。孩子们知道了衣服是怎样做成的，他们就会格外爱惜自己的衣服，更加尊重工人叔叔的劳动。
