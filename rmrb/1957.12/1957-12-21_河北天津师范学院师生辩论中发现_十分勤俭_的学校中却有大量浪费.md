Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 20th. Teachers and students of Hebei Tianjin Normal College recently launched a heated debate on the issue of running the school thriftily.

This school is considered to have the worst conditions among the six universities in Tianjin, with crowded buildings and relatively simple equipment. Although the library has a collection of 270,000 books, it only has two small reading rooms. The school has no heating, and most toilets do not have flushing systems... and so on. Under these circumstances, a considerable number of teachers and students believe that "our school is frugal to the extreme" and "there is no room for saving," and some even think that this school does not resemble a university at all, advocating merging it with other universities.

However, according to revelations during the 放放 (fangfang, "letting go") period, massive waste exists everywhere in this school, which is considered to be already "extremely frugal." Many big-character posters sharply criticized the bloated organization and overstaffing. Yang Hui and other students from the Chinese Department pointed out: "Our college has 408 faculty and staff members, but 218 are non-teaching staff. This phenomenon is unreasonable." All second-year students of the Russian Language program in the Foreign Languages Department wrote in a big-character poster: "Look at the Foreign Languages Department, the ratio of teachers to students is two to one; there are few students and many teachers, and many people have nothing to do." The library has a collection of 270,000 books, but only 50,000 are circulating. Some books have been bought for more than a year but still have not been cataloged, and some books have even disappeared. The rare book "Nan Hua Da Cheng," worth 1,200 yuan, "disappeared" a year ago and was only recently found in a pile of scattered books in the book depot. The library originally had a "Si Ku Bei Yao" worth more than 4,000 yuan, but the purchasing staff did not know about it and bought another copy; teachers in the History Department also bought a copy. The Physical Education Research Office only has eight teachers, but it subscribes to as many as 56 kinds of magazines and pictorials, including 22 foreign language pictorials and magazines. The waste of water and electricity is also astonishing, with the whole college consuming an average of 150 pounds of water per person per day. The school's public bathhouse is not only free for teachers and students of the college, but even relatives and friends can enjoy free treatment there. As for the waste caused by not cherishing public property, it is too much to count.

During the debate, many people believed that this situation not only caused material losses but also fostered individualism and a lack of concern for public property among teachers and students. For example, the Fine Arts Department once went to Beijing to buy plaster statues, which only required one person, but eight people went, and the reimbursement for travel expenses and subsidies alone amounted to more than 100 yuan. Some students used scholarships to buy high-end cosmetics, watch movies, and eat and drink extravagantly. Most people believe that the poor conditions of the school are a fact, but they do not affect the quality of learning. Mu Jiaqi, a professor in the Fine Arts Department, said: "In the past, the Yan'an Lu Xun Academy of Arts used branches instead of easels, and if there were no charcoal sticks, everyone went to burn them. In such difficult circumstances, many outstanding talents were cultivated. Now our conditions are many times better than in the past." This vivid contrast gave everyone a profound education. Many teachers and students connected the economic and political significance of running schools thriftily, believing that "building the country thriftily and running schools thriftily" is an indispensable part of building our country into a socialist nation.

After the debate, the atmosphere of running the school thriftily began to take shape. Teachers in the Education Department decided to merge offices and hand over the three rooms vacated to the school. After discussion by all the teachers, the Fine Arts Department decided to merge three offices, saving two stoves, which would save three tons of coal this winter; and a special person will be assigned to study and draft student painting material supply methods, model use methods, and book and material purchase plans to eliminate waste and loopholes in expenditure. All the teachers also cleaned out the backlog of drafting instruments, painting tools, pigments, etc., from the warehouse, worth nearly 10,000 yuan, and they also found a precious Song Dynasty porcelain from the pile of rubbish. As each department has drafted a saving plan, the school's expenditure on books and magazines next year will be reduced from more than 17,000 yuan this year to more than 6,000 yuan. Many students with better economic situations who received scholarships also voluntarily requested to reduce their scholarships.

### 河北天津师范学院师生辩论中发现  “十分勤俭”的学校中却有大量浪费

    河北天津师范学院师生辩论中发现
    “十分勤俭”的学校中却有大量浪费
    新华社天津20日电  河北天津师范学院师生员工最近对勤俭办学问题展开了一场热烈的辩论。
    这个学校在天津六所高等学校中被认为是条件最差的，房屋拥挤，设备也比较简陋。图书馆虽有藏书二十七万册，但只有两个小阅报室。学校没有暖气，大部分厕所没有抽水马桶……等等。在这种情况下，有相当一部分师生认为“我们学校勤俭到家了”、“不存在节约问题”，有的人甚至认为这个学校不像个高等学校，主张并到别的高等学校去。
    但是根据鸣放中的揭露，这所被认为已经“十分勤俭”的学校却到处有大量的浪费。很多大字报尖锐地批评了机构臃肿，人浮于事现象。中文系学生杨辉等人提出：“我院教职员工有四百零八人，但是非教学人员就有二百一十八人，这种现象不合理。”外文系俄文专业二年级全体学生在大字报中写道：“请看外文系，师生比例二比一；学生少，先生多，不少人闲着没事做”。图书馆藏书二十七万册，但流动的只有五万册，有的书买了一年多还编不出书目来，有的书甚至不翼而飞。价值一千二百元的绝版书“南画大成”在一年前竟然“失踪”，最近才从书库的零散书堆里找出来。图书馆原有一部价值四千多元的“四库备要”，但是采购人员竟然不知，又买了一部；历史系教师也买了一部。体育教研室只有八个教师，订阅的杂志画报竟达五十六种之多，其中有二十二种外文画报杂志。水、电等的浪费也是惊人的，全院平均每人每天消耗一百五十磅水。学校的公共浴室，不但本院师生能免费洗澡，连亲戚朋友都可以在那里享受免费待遇。至于不爱惜公物造成的浪费更多到无法统计。
    在辩论中，很多人认为，这种情况不仅造成了物质上的损失，而且在师生中滋长了个人主义、不爱惜公共财产等坏思想。例如美术系有一次到北京买石膏像，只要一个人就够了，结果去了八个人，光是报销车费、补贴费就一百多元。有的学生拿助学金买高级化妆品，看电影，大吃大喝。大多数人认为，学校条件差是事实，但是并不影响学习质量。美术系教授穆家麒说：“过去延安鲁迅艺术学院用树枝代替画架，没有炭条，大家去烧。在那样的艰苦环境下，培养出了许多优秀人才。现在我们的条件比过去不知好多少倍。”这种生动的对比，更给大家以深刻的教育。许多师生联系到勤俭办学的经济意义和政治意义，认为“勤俭建国、勤俭办学”是把我国建成一个社会主义国家不可缺少的一条。
    经过辩论，这个学校勤俭办学的风气开始树立起来。教育系教师决定合并办公室，把腾出来的三间房子交给学校。美术系经过全体教师讨论，决定合并三间办公室，节省两个炉子，今冬就能节省三吨煤；并且由专人研究和起草学生绘画材料供应办法、模特儿使用办法、图书资料购买计划，以杜绝经费开支上的浪费和漏洞。全体教师还从仓库里清理出积压的制图仪器、绘画用具、颜料等，价值近万元，他们还从破烂堆里找出了一件珍贵的宋瓷。由于各系都草拟了节约办法，这个学校明年的书报杂志经费将从今年的一万七千多元减少到六千多元。不少经济情况较好而领取助学金的学生，也自动提出要求退减助学金。
