    Concrete Manifestation of Socialist Democracy
    Soviet People Elect New Judges and Jurors
    (Our Moscow Dispatch, December 15) Today, the election of people's courts was held in the cities and villages of twelve Soviet republics (the other three republics will hold elections on the 27th of this month).
    Thousands upon thousands of polling stations for the election of people's courts opened their doors at six o'clock this morning, welcoming working people to exercise their rights as citizens and elect the social activists they love as people's judges and jurors of the people's courts.
    The Soviet People's Court is a product of the victory of the October Revolution. Over the years, the People's Court has done a great deal of work and achieved remarkable achievements in consolidating the socialist system, educating people to abide by state laws, observe social public order, observe labor production discipline, and protect people's right to work and rest. Due to the continuous consolidation of the Soviet social system and the continuous improvement of the people's material living standards and communist moral standards, abiding by state laws has become a common practice, and criminal acts have been greatly reduced. For example, in the Russian Federal Republic, criminal acts in 1956 were reduced by two-thirds compared with 1947, and this situation was particularly significant in industrial cities such as Sverdlovsk and Chelyabinsk. Moreover, during the same period, the ratio of criminal cases to civil cases has changed, and the number of people committing criminal cases has decreased. For example, in 1947, civil cases in the Russian Federal Republic accounted for 64% of the total number of cases, while in 1956, civil cases accounted for 81.6%. The mass election of the Soviet People's Court is a concrete manifestation of the Soviet democratic system, and the Soviet people have always regarded the mass election of the People's Court as a major event in social and political life. Working people are welcoming the election day with increased enthusiasm for labor production.
    In order to widely promote democracy, election work in various places began to be prepared a month ago, and candidates were carefully selected, and extensive publicity was carried out. For example, propagandists and candidates of the Russian Federal Republic have made 34,917 reports on the work of the People's Court to the electoral masses.
    Today, the people of Moscow, like the people all over the Soviet Union, have been going to the 1,763 polling stations distributed in various districts of the city to vote since early morning. Today, the city of Moscow will elect 185 people's judges and 13,875 jurors.

    社会主义民主的具体表现
    苏联人民选举新法官和陪审员
    本报莫斯科15日电　今天苏联十二个加盟共和国城乡举行了人民法院选举（另有三个共和国将于本月27日举行）。
    成千上万的人民法院选举投票站，从清晨六时就打开了大门，迎接劳动人民前来行使自己的公民权利，把自己所爱戴的社会积极分子选为人民法院的人民法官和陪审员。
    苏维埃人民法院是十月革命胜利的产物。多年来，人民法院在巩固社会主义制度，教育人们遵守国家法律、遵守社会公共秩序、遵守劳动生产纪律和保护人民的劳动和休息权利方面进行了巨大工作，取得了显著成就。由于苏维埃社会制度的不断巩固，人民物质生活水平和共产主义道德水平的不断提高，遵守国家法律已成风气，犯罪的行为已大大减少。如俄罗斯联邦共和国在1956年比1947年的犯罪行为减少了三分之二，这种情况尤以斯维尔德洛夫斯克、车里雅宾斯克这些工业城市更为显著。而且，在同时期内，刑事案件和民事案件的比例有了变化，犯刑事案件的人次越来越少了。如1947年，俄罗斯联邦共和国的民事案件占全部案件总数64％，而在1956年，民事案件占到81.6％。苏联人民法院的群众性选举，是苏维埃民主制度的具体表现，苏联人民一向认为人民法院的群众选举是社会政治生活中的一件大事。劳动人民以提高劳动生产热情来迎接选举日。
    为了广泛地发扬民主，各地选举工作都在一个月之前就开始作准备，认真地推选候选人，进行了广泛的宣传。如俄罗斯联邦共和国的宣传员与候选人向选举群众先后作了三万四千九百一十七次关于人民法院工作的报告。
    今天，莫斯科的人民与全苏各地的人民一样，从清早起陆续到分布在全市各区的一千七百六十三个选举站投票。今天，莫斯科市将要选出一百八十五个人民法官，一万三千八百七十五个陪审员。
