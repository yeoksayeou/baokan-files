Xinhua News Agency, December 24th -- A new major achievement in China's aviation industry: China's own multi-purpose civil aircraft, the "An-2" model, has been successfully manufactured.

　　The "An-2" is the first civil aircraft manufactured by China itself. The successful manufacture of this aircraft marks a significant development in China's civil aviation industry. Through the manufacturing of this aircraft, China has initially mastered the technology of manufacturing faster and larger civil aircraft.

　　The "An-2" aircraft has a wide range of uses and can be used by various sectors of the national economy. After leaving the factory, this aircraft can be used as a transport aircraft, passenger aircraft, ambulance aircraft, and for training parachutists without any modifications; with slight modifications, it can be used for agriculture, such as fertilizing, sowing, pest control, and forest protection; it can also be used for geological surveys, atmospheric exploration, and aerial photography. If the existing landing gear is replaced with skis or pontoons, it can also fly in the snow in northern China or take off and land on water.

　　This aircraft has excellent take-off and landing performance and can take off and land in fields and small landing strips. This aircraft is equipped with various instruments for night flight and blind flight, making it safe and reliable to use. The "An-2" aircraft has a larger carrying capacity compared to similar aircraft.

　　During the manufacturing process of this aircraft, engineering and technical personnel and workers displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, overcame various difficulties in manufacturing, and completed the manufacturing task a quarter ahead of schedule.

　　On December 22nd, the National Provisional Appraisal Committee appraised this aircraft. The person in charge of the Provisional Appraisal Committee said that the quality of this aircraft is good and meets the original design requirements. Relevant departments of the Central Government also sent personnel to participate in the appraisal ceremony, expressing satisfaction with the manufacture of this aircraft and congratulating the employees.

    我国航空工业新的重大成就
    第一架多种用途民用飞机诞生
    新华社24日讯　我国航空工业上又一新的重大成就——我国自己制造的一种多种用途的民用飞机——“安二”型飞机制造成功。
      “安二”型飞机是我国自己制造的第一架民用飞机。这架飞机的制造成功，标志着我国民用航空工业的重大发展。通过这架飞机的制造，我国便初步掌握了制造速度较高的和型别较大的民用飞机的技术。
    “安二”型飞机的用途很广，国民经济的各个部门都可以使用。这种飞机出厂后，不需要作任何改装就可以作为运输机、客机、救护机和训练跳伞运动员用；稍微作一些改装，就可以用于农业，如施肥、播种、灭虫和防护森林等；还可以用来进行地质勘测、大气探测和空中摄影。如果把现在用的起落架改换成雪橇或者浮筒，它也可以在我国北方雪地飞行或水上起落。
    这种飞机起飞和着落性能很好，可以在田野和很小的降落场上起飞和着落。这种飞机装有夜航和盲目飞行用的各种仪表，使用安全可靠。“安二”型飞机和同类型的飞机相比载重量大。
    这架飞机在制造过程中，工程技术人员和工人们发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，克服了制造中的各种困难，提前一个季度完成了制造任务。
    本月22日，国家临时鉴定委员会鉴定了这架飞机。临时鉴定委员会的负责人说，这架飞机的质量良好，符合原设计的要求。中央各有关部门也派员参加了鉴定仪式，对这架飞机的制造表示满意，并向职工们祝贺。（附图片）
