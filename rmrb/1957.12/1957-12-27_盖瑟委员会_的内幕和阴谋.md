Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 26th: A shocking propaganda campaign revolving around the so-called secret report of the "Gaither Committee" is continuing in the United States. From newspaper reports, it can be seen that this report, which advocates a frenzied arms race, is an episode in the behind-the-scenes struggle within the upper echelons of the government and the American financial-industrial groups over fundamental issues of government economic and military policy. This struggle is caused by conflicting interests among different monopoly capital groups regarding the amount of US military expenditure and the distribution of military orders, as well as different evaluations of the economic and political consequences of the very serious inflation.

When the "Gaither Committee" began its work, serious open and covert struggles had already broken out within the American ruling group on economic and military policy issues. The capitalist groups most closely tied to obtaining huge military orders, and who are most concerned with maintaining international tensions and the "Cold War" for this purpose, expressed dissatisfaction with some of the measures taken by the Eisenhower administration under the influence of former Treasury Secretary Humphrey. These measures included implementing the so-called "balanced budget" policy, declaring inflation as "public enemy number one," and limiting direct military spending to a certain level (38 billion US dollars).

This "balanced budget" policy relies on the support of the majority of the American bourgeoisie. Business newspapers such as "Journal of Commerce," "The Wall Street Journal," "Barron's Weekly," "The Wall Street Magazine," and "The Commercial and Financial Chronicle," as well as the bank bulletins of "First National City Bank of New York" and "Guaranty Trust Company," all demanded that the government "observe standards" in terms of total expenses and military expenses, and take measures to prevent inflation, which contains dangerous social-economic consequences. They said that the current military expenditure is fully capable of ensuring the proper American military situation, as long as this sum is spent "economically and reasonably."

Military speculators and militarists decided to use the "Gaither Committee" to vigorously promote a "special military spending plan."

The "Gaither Committee" submitted a report to President Eisenhower immediately after the Soviet Union launched its first artificial satellite. It believed that this moment was particularly favorable for achieving the committee's political goals. Newspapers said that the report was discussed at a meeting of the National Security Council on November 7th, and "financial leaders" McCloy and Lovett (former US Secretary of Defense) were invited to attend the meeting. According to journalist Roberts, they had advised President Eisenhower to endorse the "special action plan" provided by the "Gaither Committee."

The group of militarists and military speculators gathered around this committee clearly believed that they could only achieve complete victory in the contest against the supporters of the "balanced budget" policy if they could use the "secret" report to influence the broader American bourgeoisie.

The congresses convened by various American capitalist organizations (including the National Association of Manufacturers) in November and December showed that the majority of the American bourgeoisie opposed the "special plan" and opposed excessive government spending, as this would further exacerbate the already critical inflation. In this situation, the members of the "Gaither Committee" believed that "it is necessary to sound the alarm in the United States" to awaken Americans from their "happy dreams." They believed that even publishing a portion of their secret report could play this "warning" role.

However, as can be seen from newspaper reports, the issue of publishing the "Gaither Committee" report caused divisions within the Eisenhower administration. Some government officials were concerned that publishing this propaganda tool – the report – would cause excessive panic among Americans. In addition, this report would become a very valuable material for the leaders of the Democratic Party, who have been condemning the Republican government for years, saying that the so-called "balanced budget" implemented by the Republican government restricts the expansion of the American military machine. They intended to use this report to confirm their condemnation of the government.

The warmongering group did not wait for the government to decide to publish the "Gaither Committee" report, and had already "privately" decided to clamor about this report in the newspapers.

The issue of using the report to conduct appropriate "education" of American public opinion was discussed at an informal meeting of a group of capitalists on December 10th. This meeting was held at the home of former Undersecretary of Defense, Foster, a member of the "Gaither Committee" who led the committee during Gaither's illness. This meeting was ostensibly called a "banquet," and attendees included Rockefeller, the publisher of several newspapers and "Look" magazine, Cowles, Paul Nitze, and some experts in creating "public opinion." US Vice President Nixon also attended the meeting. It is clear that a plan to "publicize the Gaither Committee report" was formulated at the meeting.

The results of the meeting were quickly apparent. Information about the contents of the "Gaither Committee" report began to "seep" into newspapers in increasing amounts, accompanied by commentaries meticulously crafted with the full skill of modern American advertising.

Finally, several Democratic congressmen demanded that the report be made public. The "Washington Post," "New York Herald Tribune," and "The Christian Science Monitor" also advocated publishing the report.

According to newspaper reports, it was also decided at the meeting at Foster's home to establish a permanent "alarm group" whose mission was to keep the country in a state of "constant unease." "The New York Times" reporter pointed out that the purpose of this group is to sound the alarm throughout the country and explain that "money and comfort must be sacrificed to consolidate national defense." The core of this group of panic-mongers and war hysterics is the members of the "Gaither Committee" and its many "advisers" who participated in drafting the report. The head of the entire group remains Foster.

It is no accident that this big capitalist plays such a role. During World War II, when Foster worked in the Quartermaster Corps of the Department of the Army, he established close ties with many military suppliers. After the war, Foster served in the Truman administration as Assistant Secretary of Commerce, head of the "Economic Cooperation Administration," and Undersecretary of Defense. In 1953, Foster was elected as the full-time chairman of the "Chemical Industry Association," composed of large factory owners and industrialists. He is currently the vice chairman of "Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation," which is fulfilling huge military orders. This company belongs to the sphere of influence of the Rockefeller consortium. According to "New York Times" commentator Crocker, Foster recently delivered a speech at an officers' gathering in which he expressed the view of launching a "preemptive war" against the Soviet Union.

The "Foster Group" has allies in the government and in Congress. According to American newspapers, Vice President Nixon is very close to this group. It is also said that a large portion of senior officials in the State Department, headed by Dulles, agree with the group's goals. Foster can fully expect to receive support from the Pentagon (US Department of Defense). Although the capitalists who joined the "Foster Group" are "orthodox Republicans," it is Democrats rather than Republicans who are the most active and vocal in Congress.

The activities of the "Gaither Committee" show what kind of tricks the United States is using to create "public opinion" on the issue of war and peace. "Chicago Daily Tribune" recently pointed out the connection between the members of this committee and military supplies, saying: "When this group gathers, the drums of war will sound."

### “盖瑟委员会”的内幕和阴谋

    “盖瑟委员会”的内幕和阴谋
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社纽约25日讯：围绕着所谓“盖瑟委员会”的秘密报告而展开的骇人听闻的宣传运动正在美国继续着。从报纸的报道中可以看出，这个鼓吹疯狂备战的报告是政府和美国金融工业集团上层分子内部在政府经济和军事政策的根本问题上幕后斗争的一个插曲。这一斗争是由于不同垄断资本集团在美国的军事开支数额问题和军事定货分配方面的利害冲突以及由于对十分严重的通货膨胀所产生的经济和政治后果的不同评价态度而引起的。
    在“盖瑟委员会”开始工作的时候，美国统治集团内部就已经在经济和军事政策问题上发生了严重的公开的和暗中的斗争。同取得巨额军事定货利害关系最密切的，和为此目的最关心保持国际紧张局势和“冷战”的资本家集团，对于艾森豪威尔政府在前财政部长汉弗来的影响下采取的一些措施表示不满，这些措施就是实行所谓“平衡预算”政策，宣布通货膨胀为“第一号敌人”和把直接军事开支限制在一定的水平内（三百八十亿美元）。
    这种“平衡预算”的政策依靠着美国资产阶级的多数的支持。“商务日报”、“华尔街日报”、“拜龙”周刊、“华尔街”杂志、“商业金融纪事报”这些商界报纸以及“纽约第一国家银行”的银行公报和“保证信托公司”的公报，都要求政府在总的费用和军事费用方面“遵守尺度”，并且采取措施来防止包含着危险的社会—经济后果的通货膨胀。它们说，目前的军费完全能够保证应有的美国军事状况，只要是“节省和合理地”花费这笔款项。
    军事投机者和军国主义者决定利用“盖瑟委员会”来为“特别军费计划”大肆宣传。
    “盖瑟委员会”在苏联发射出第一颗人造卫星后马上向艾森豪威尔总统提出报告，它认为，这个时刻对达到这个委员会的政治目的特别有利。报纸说，这个报告11月7日在国家安全委员会的会议上进行了讨论，“金融界领袖”麦克洛埃和罗维特（美国前国防部长）应邀参加了这次会议。据记者罗伯茨说，他们曾经劝告艾森豪威尔总统赞同“盖瑟委员会”提供的“特别行动计划”。
    集合在这个委员会周围的军国主义者和军事投机者集团显然认为，他们只有在有可能利用“秘密”报告来对更广大的美国资产阶级发生影响的时候，才能在对“平衡预算”政策的拥护者的较量中获得完全胜利。
    美国各资本家组织（其中包括全国制造商协会）在11月和12月召开的代表大会表明，美国资产阶级的多数反对“特别计划”，反对政府支出过大，因为这样会使本来就已经危急的通货膨胀更加紧张。在这种情况下，“盖瑟委员会”的委员认为，“需要在美国敲起警钟”，以便使美国人从“快乐的迷梦”中惊醒。他们认为，即使公布他们的秘密报告的一部分也可以起到这种“警告”的作用。
    但是，从报纸消息中可以看出，关于公布“盖瑟委员会”的报告的问题在艾森豪威尔政府中引起了分歧。一些政府官员担心，公布这个宣传工具——报告——会在美国人中引起过分的惊惶。除此以外，这个报告会成为民主党的领袖们的一个非常宝贵的材料，这些人多年来都在谴责共和党政府，说共和党政府执行的所谓“平衡预算”限制着美国军事机器的扩大。他们打算利用这个报告来证实他们对政府的谴责。
    黩武主义集团不等到政府决定公布“盖瑟委员会”的报告，就已经“私下”决定环绕着这个报告在报上大肆叫嚣。
    关于利用报告对美国舆论进行应有的“教育”的问题在12月10日一批资本家的非正式会议上进行了讨论，这次会议是在“盖瑟委员会”的成员、曾在盖瑟患病期间领导委员会的前国防部副部长福斯特的家中举行的。这次会议表面上说成是一个“宴会”，出席会议的有洛克菲勒，几家报纸和“展望”杂志的发行人柯尔斯、保罗·尼兹和一些编造“舆论”的大专家。出席会议的还有美国副总统尼克松。很清楚，在会议上制定了“宣传盖瑟委员会报告”的计划。
    会议结果很快就可以看出来了。关于“盖瑟委员会”报告的内容的消息开始愈来愈多地“渗入”报纸，并且带有以现代美国广告的全副本领精心制造的评论。
    最后，若干民主党议员要求报告公开发表。主张发表这个报告的还有“华盛顿邮报”、“纽约先驱论坛报”和“基督教科学箴言报”。
    据报纸报道，在福斯特家的会议上还决定建立一个常设的“警号小组”，它的使命是使国家处于“经常不安”的状态。“纽约时报”记者指出，这个小组的目的就是向全国敲起警钟，并说明“为了巩固国防必须牺牲金钱和安乐”。这一群制造惶乱和战争歇斯底里的人的核心就是“盖瑟委员会”的委员和它的很多参加起草报告的“顾问”。整个集团的头目仍然是福斯特。
    这个大资本家扮演这样的角色不是偶然的。在第二次世界大战期间，当福斯特在陆军部军需部门工作的时候就同许多军用物资供应商建立了密切的联系。战后，福斯特在杜鲁门政府里担任过商务部部长助理、“经济合作总署”负责人和国防部副部长。1953年福斯特被选为大工厂主和产业家组成的“化学工业协会”的专职会长。他现在担任完成着巨额军事定货的“奥林·梅提森化学公司”的副董事长。这一公司属于洛克菲勒财团的势力范围以内。据“纽约时报”的评论员克罗克报道，福斯特不久前在一个军官集会上演说时就发表了对苏联发动“先发制人的战争”的观点。
    “福斯特集团”在政府中和在议会中都有同盟者。据美国报纸报道，副总统尼克松同这个集团关系很密切。还有人说，以杜勒斯为首的国务院的很大一部分高级官员都赞同这个集团的目的。福斯特完全可能指望得到五角大楼（美国国防部）的支持。虽然加入“福斯特集团”的资本家是“正统的共和党人”，但是在议会中表现最积极、叫喊得最凶的与其说是共和党人，倒不如说是民主党人。
    “盖瑟委员会”的活动表明，美国正在利用什么样的诡计在战争与和平的问题上制造“社会舆论”。“芝加哥每日论坛报”不久前在指出这个委员会的成员同军事供应的联系时说：“当这批人集合的时候，战鼓就要响起来了。”
