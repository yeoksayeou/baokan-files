Paris News: As letters protesting the NATO high-level meeting's planning of atomic war preparations poured into the Palais de Chaillot from all over France, workers and patriots sent an increasing number of delegations to city halls, the National Assembly, and parliamentary reception rooms to express the people's opposition to NATO's intensified nuclear arms race. Communist and Socialist parliamentarians in the Paris region received numerous delegations.

Forty prominent French figures who recently published an appeal calling for a parliamentary debate on NATO's war preparation plans held a press conference at the Hôtel Lutetia on the evening of the 17th. Speakers at the conference unanimously emphasized the dangers inherent in the plan to establish rocket launch sites on French territory.

London News: Thirteen British Labour Party MPs submitted a motion to the House of Commons on the 18th protesting Prime Minister Macmillan's acceptance of the U.S. plan to establish four medium-range missile bases in Britain.

Reports indicate that after Macmillan returns to London from Paris, the House of Commons is scheduled to hold a major debate on foreign policy on the 20th. Labour leaders have already met to prepare.

Berlin News: The Rostock City Council of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and the Suhl District Committee of the National Front of the German Democratic Republic sent telegrams to the NATO Paris Conference, protesting the U.S.'s intention to store weapons of mass destruction in Western Europe and demanding negotiations with socialist countries in the spirit of the Peace Manifesto of the Communist and Workers' Parties Conference.

The trade union organization of the Berlin Treptow electrical factory, representing the factory's 10,000 employees, protested the U.S.'s establishment of U.S. atomic bases in Western Europe.

Eighty-four professors and lecturers at the University of Heidelberg in West Germany jointly issued an appeal to West German Chancellor Adenauer on the 18th, opposing the establishment of rocket launch sites on West German territory and demanding disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. Twenty-one professors and lecturers at the Hanover Teacher Training College issued a declaration protesting the transformation of West Germany into an American atomic base.

Many local councils in West Germany passed resolutions protesting NATO's atomic armaments plans and opposing the establishment of rocket bases in West Germany.

West German Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer criticized the Adenauer government's atomic armaments policy at a press conference in Bonn. He called for a foreign policy debate in the Bonn Bundestag.

Religious figures in West Germany have also participated in the protest movement against atomic armaments policies. Catholic writer Thomas published an open letter protesting West Germany's establishment of atomic armaments. Newspapers reported that prominent West German religious figure Niemöller, in an interview with a reporter from "Libération" in Paris, advocated the establishment of a "militarily neutral zone in Central Europe where no atomic weapons are stored."

Members of the international anti-war organization in Essen, the central city of the Ruhr region in West Germany, passed a resolution demanding a halt to atomic weapons testing, prohibiting the storage of atomic weapons and rockets in West Germany, and prohibiting the equipping of the West German army with such weapons.

Large-scale demonstrations were held in Forlì, La Spezia, and Genoa. Mass protest meetings were held in Correggio and Guastalla. Youth organizations in Rome posted slogans on walls opposing the establishment of missile bases in Italy.
