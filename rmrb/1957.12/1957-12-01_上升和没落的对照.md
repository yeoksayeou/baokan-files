Contrast of Rise and Fall
　　Gu Si
　　The Meeting of International Proletarian Solidarity
　　The representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of sixty-four countries, gathered in Moscow to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Revolution, recently held a meeting, and the Communist and Workers' Parties of twelve socialist countries also held another meeting. Both meetings issued declarations of great significance.
　　In the history of the international communist movement, for the first time, representatives of so many countries' Communist and Workers' Parties, representing an unprecedentedly huge international proletarian vanguard, gathered in the capital of the Soviet Union, the center of the international communist movement, to sincerely discuss the most pressing issues of the current international situation and the international communist movement, and issued a sacred call to the people of the world to strive for a better future with such confidence. This is an event of great significance. It symbolizes the great leap forward of the international communist movement in the past forty years, embodies the great international solidarity of the communist movement, and demonstrates the relationship between the fraternal parties based on the unity of Marxist-Leninist ideology and the principles of proletarian internationalism. The convening of these two meetings and the publication of the great revolutionary declarations will have a profound influence and a great encouraging effect on further strengthening the solidarity of the international proletariat and promoting the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism, for the defense of peace and for socialism.
　　The declarations of both meetings pointed out that the balance of power in the world today has undergone fundamental changes. Because the forces of socialism and peace have already gained a decisive advantage, war can be prevented and peace can be maintained. "Let countries with different social systems compete with each other in the development of peaceful science and peaceful technology in the future." - This solemn call issued by the representatives of the sixty-four countries' Communist and Workers' Parties is a just challenge to the old world and a powerful mobilization to the working people of the world.
　　After the two declarations were published, they have caused widespread repercussions internationally. They are not only enthusiastically supported by the people of socialist countries, but also welcomed by the people of the world who love peace and social progress, and strive for national independence and democratic freedom. Even some bourgeois news commentators in the West cannot but admit the great significance of the declaration. For example, the British "Daily Telegraph" believes that the Moscow meeting and its declaration show that the socialist camp is "vigorous". United Press reporter Shapiro saw the victorious conviction expressed in the declaration, and sighed: "International communism has now formed an arrogant front, showing unlimited confidence in riding the wind and waves to the future."
　　The New Development of Imperialist Contradictions
　　While the international proletariat is commemorating its historic festival with great solidarity, the imperialist camp is full of life-and-death contradictions. The infighting between the three major imperialist powers, the United States, Britain, and France, over the so-called "Tunisian arms incident" is one of the latest examples in this regard.
　　Although France was forced to recognize Tunisia's independence more than a year ago, it does not actually want to give up its colonial interests there, and at the same time, it does not want to see the formation of an anti-colonial alliance between North African countries. Therefore, it wants to continue to maintain its control over Tunisia and incorporate it into a so-called "North African joint defense" system dominated by France, in order to stabilize the seriously shaken position of French colonialism in North Africa.
　　On the other hand, the United States has long wanted to intervene in this region. As early as World War II, the United States occupied Tunisia under the name of "aid", and subsequently established military bases there. After the war, American monopoly capital strengthened its infiltration and gained huge oil interests. After the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt suffered a disastrous blow, Washington was even more eager to try and gradually deepen its involvement. Its long-term plan is to form a "North African Federation" and a "Mediterranean Group" under the control of the United States, thereby establishing hegemony in the Mediterranean and North African regions.
　　As for Britain, although it had to give up its position as the overlord of the Middle East colonial camp to the United States after suffering a disastrous defeat in the Suez incident, it is always trying to make a comeback. The serious setbacks of the Eisenhower Doctrine in the Middle East and the disintegration of France's colonial system in North Africa are considered by it to be rare opportunities.
　　The Tunisian arms incident occurred against this background.
　　In order to continue to maintain control over Tunisia, France stipulated that only it could handle the supply of weapons to Tunisia, and stipulated conditions for the supply of weapons that violated Tunisian sovereignty. This is obviously unacceptable for a sovereign country that is striving for complete independence. As a result, France suddenly interrupted the supply of weapons to Tunisia in August.
　　Two months ago, the United States and Britain had already been engaging in behind-the-scenes activities, trying to expand their infiltration into Tunisia through arms supplies, paving the way for further infiltration into North Africa. At that time, France was in urgent need of American and British "understanding" on the Algerian issue and support in the United Nations General Assembly, and needed American loans to overcome its financial difficulties. American and British imperialism believed that the time had come and could not wait. Therefore, the United States notified France on the 13th about the supply of weapons to Tunisia, and on the 14th, the United States, in order to exert pressure, interrupted the negotiations on financial assistance between the United States and France, and the next day, it and Britain each urgently airlifted a batch of pre-prepared weapons to Tunisia.
　　It can be seen from the specific practices adopted by the United States and Britain in this unilateral action that their real purpose is to both squeeze out France's colonial forces and prevent the continued upsurge of the North African national independence movement.
　　The weapons transported were only a small number of so-called "symbolic" weapons, and more weapon supplies would be conditional on Tunisia's implementation of the strategic plans of the United States and Britain, that is, to ensure that Tunisia is dependent on the imperialist bloc and to carry out activities for the establishment of the "North African Group" planned by the United States and Britain. This action was planned as early as the Washington talks between Eisenhower and Macmillan. This time, taking advantage of France's urgent need for help from the United States and Britain, they immediately acted, making France unable to resist.
　　After the incident, public opinion in Paris was in an uproar, believing that this was an act of betrayal against "allies" and a step for the United States and Britain to jointly divide the spheres of influence in the Western world. The French government formally protested to the United States and Britain. From the capitals of other member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, there were also calls expressing dissatisfaction with the actions of the United States and Britain. Then, Pineau visited Washington, Macmillan visited Paris, and the three parties bargained. The uproar caused by the United States, Britain, and France over the issue of arms supply to Tunisia has not completely subsided. Their contradictions are becoming more complicated and profound around the upcoming summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
    The Struggles of American Imperialism
　　The crisis caused by the Soviet artificial satellites in the imperialist camp, and the depth of this crisis, is vividly demonstrated in the panicked reaction of Western countries, especially the United States. American newspapers are full of frustrated cries: "The United States has been defeated," "American prestige has declined," "Deterrence has been shattered," "The Cold War policy has gone bankrupt," ... "Anxiety," "Frustration," "Shock," "Surprise," - many such words are used to describe Washington's reaction. One American commentator summarized the chaotic situation in one sentence: "A national crisis." Public opinion has attacked the government for "dereliction of duty," and there have been calls in Congress to investigate "the reasons for American backwardness" and to hold accountability. Commentators who are more calm have come to more calm conclusions. Lippmann said: "When the launch of the Soviet artificial satellite revealed that we are far from being powerful, our prestige and influence have been greatly shaken." Harsch pointed out that the United States has passed through the "historical period" when it could run rampant, and the future will be "a world in which the United States will gradually be surpassed in proportion and quantity." In short, the American paper tiger has been exposed, and the "free country" group headed by the United States is facing the danger of further division.
　　In order to ease this serious crisis in the imperialist camp, Eisenhower and Macmillan held emergency consultations. One of their main conclusions was: It is necessary to find ways to restore the "unity" and "confidence" of the West. According to this plan, imperialism loudly trumpets the "mutual reliance" of Western countries.
　　The summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is said to be discussing the issue of strengthening "unity" and "cooperation." But in fact, the United States, in "cooperation" with Britain, has already formulated a plan for this meeting, the main purpose of which is to "make each ally substantially sacrifice national sovereignty." To be more specific, the United States will further control Western countries, while giving Britain a second-class partner status. The initial disclosure of this plan has already caused "dissatisfaction" and "shock" among the "allies" in Western Europe. Paris was the first to express its opposition to the United States and Britain wanting to "take the most advantageous position for themselves, while leaving an inappropriate position for France." German newspaper commentaries stated that West Germany "does not want to be defeated at the upcoming summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization next month." At the weekly meeting of the permanent structure of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, representatives of some other countries also expressed "anxiety." These facts are the best irony of the "cooperation" and "unity" of the imperialist camp.
　　In order to reassure people and prevent the development of centrifugal tendencies, the United States is also vigorously boasting of its so-called "strength." Various speakers have come out to talk about the American missile and satellite "plans." The strategic air force, which is becoming increasingly obsolete in the rocket age, has been brought out for a performance. The plan to provide medium-range missiles to "allies" has been widely publicized, although even Dulles admits that the United States will not have such things that can be used until the end of next year at the earliest. The American president has also selected to start a series of speeches from the historically significant day of the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution to cheer up the imperialist camp.
　　It can be seen from a series of speeches delivered by Eisenhower that the American ruling group still wants to maintain international tension as much as possible and further accelerate the arms race. Military spending has been decided to be greatly increased, and the slogan of "less butter, more guns" has been officially put forward by official spokespersons. The American ruling group is still attempting to use the bankrupt "position of strength" policy to save the American crisis, but this is only a pitiful illusion.

　　上升和没落的对照
    顾思
    无产阶级国际团结的会议
    云集在莫斯科参加庆祝伟大十月革命四十周年的六十四国共产党和工人党的代表，在不久前举行了会议，同时十二个社会主义国家的共产党和工人党还举行了另一次会议。这两个会议都分别发表了意义重大的宣言。
    在国际共产主义运动史上，第一次有这样多国家的共产党和工人党的代表，代表着空前巨大的国际无产阶级先锋队伍，聚集在国际共产主义运动的中心苏联的首都，真诚地讨论了当前国际局势和国际共产主义运动中最迫切的问题，如此满怀信心地向全世界人民发出了争取美好未来的神圣号召。这是一个具有伟大意义的事件。它象征了国际共产主义运动在过去四十年间的巨大跃进，体现了共产主义运动的伟大的国际团结，表明了各兄弟党之间建立在马克思列宁主义思想的一致和无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上的关系。这两个会议的召开和发表的伟大的革命宣言，对于进一步加强国际无产阶级的团结，推进全世界人民反对帝国主义、保卫和平和争取社会主义的斗争，将产生深远的影响和巨大的鼓舞作用。
    两个会议的宣言都指出了当前世界力量的对比已发生了根本的变化。由于社会主义和和平的力量已经占有确定的优势，因此战争可以被制止，和平可以维护住。“让社会制度不同的国家今后在发展和平科学、和平技术方面彼此展开竞赛吧。”——六十四国共产党和工人党代表会议发出的这个庄严的号召，是对旧世界的一个正义的挑战，也是对全世界劳动人民的一个强有力的鼓动。
    两个宣言发表以后，在国际上已引起了广泛的反响。它们不仅为社会主义国家人民所热烈拥护，而且受到全世界爱好和平和社会进步、争取民族独立和民主自由的人民的欢迎。连西方某些资产阶级的新闻评论，也不能不承认宣言的重大意义。例如，英国的“每日电讯报”认为，莫斯科的会议及其宣言说明，社会主义阵营是“生气勃勃”的。合众社的记者夏皮罗看到了宣言所表现的胜利信念，慨叹地说：“国际共产主义现在又结成一条目空一切的阵线，表现了乘风破浪向未来前进的无限信心。”
    帝国主义相互矛盾的新发展
    当国际无产阶级以伟大的团结来纪念它的历史性节日的时候，在帝国主义阵营里，却充满着你死我活的矛盾。美英法三大帝国主义在所谓“突尼斯武器事件”上展开的一场钩心斗角的斗争，是这方面最新的例证之一。
    法国虽然在一年多以前被迫承认了突尼斯的独立，实际上却并不想放弃它在那里的殖民利益，同时又不愿看到北非国家之间结成反殖民主义的联合，因此想继续保持对它的控制，并把它纳入一个以法国为主的所谓“北非共同防御”体系，以稳定法国殖民主义在北非严重动摇的地位。
    另一方面，美国早想插足这一地区。早在第二次大战时，美国曾借“援助”之名占领过突尼斯，此后并在那里建立了军事基地。战后，美国垄断资本又加强渗入，取得了巨大的石油利益。在英法侵略埃及遭到惨重打击后，华盛顿更是磨拳擦掌，步步深入。它的长期计划是在美国的控制下形成一个“北非联邦”和“地中海集团”，从而确立在地中海和北非地区的霸权。
    至于英国，在苏伊士事件中遭受惨败后虽然不得不把中东殖民阵营的霸主地位让给美国，但是它却无时不企图卷土重来。艾森豪威尔主义在中东遭到严重挫折和法国在北非的殖民体系的趋于瓦解，被它认为是难得的时机。
    突尼斯武器事件就是在这个背景下发生的。
    为了继续对突尼斯保持控制，法国规定了只能由它来包办对突尼斯的武器供应，并为武器供应规定了违反突尼斯主权的条件。这对于一个正在努力争取完全独立的主权国家，显然是无法接受的。这样，法国突然于八月中断了对突尼斯的武器供应。
    两个月以前，美国和英国就已经在进行幕后活动，想通过武器供应来扩大渗入突尼斯，为进一步扩大渗入北非铺平道路。那时，法国正急需美英在阿尔及利亚问题上的“谅解”和在联合国大会上的支持，并需要美国的贷款以度过财政难关。美英帝国主义认为时机已到，迫不及待。于是，美国在13日就供应突尼斯武器事照会法国，14日，美国为施加压力，就中断了美法关于财政援助的谈判，第二天就和英国各自紧急空运了一批事先准备好的武器至突尼斯。
    从美英采取这个片面行动的具体做法可以看出，它们的真实目的是既要排挤法国的殖民势力，又图防止北非民族独立运动的继续高涨。
    运去的武器只是所谓“象征性”的微少数量，更多的武器供应将以突尼斯执行美英的战略计划为条件，也就是确保突尼斯依附于帝国主义集团，并为成立美英所策划的“北非集团”进行活动。这次行动是早在艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦的华盛顿会谈中就策划好的，这次趁法国急切有求于美英的时候，就立即行动，使法国无法招架。
    事情发生之后，巴黎方面舆论大哗，认为这是对“盟国”背信弃义的行为，是美英共谋瓜分西方世界势力范围的步骤。法国政府向美英正式表示了抗议。从北大西洋公约集团其他成员国首都，也纷纷发出对美英行动表示不满的呼声。接着，比诺访问了华盛顿，麦克米伦访问了巴黎，三方面进行了讨价还价。美英法之间在突尼斯武器供应问题上掀起的轩然巨波尚未完全平息。围绕着不久即将举行的北大西洋集团首脑会议，他们之间的矛盾正在更趋复杂化和深刻化。
        美帝国主义的挣扎
    苏联的人造卫星在帝国主义阵营中引起的危机，其深刻程度，在西方国家特别是美国的惊惶失措的反应中生动地表现出来。美国报纸上充满了沮丧的呼号：“美国被击败了”、“美国声誉低落了”、“威慑粉碎了”、“冷战政策破产了”、……。“忧虑”、“沮丧”、“震动”、“吃惊”、——许多这类字眼被用来形容华盛顿的反应。一个美国评论员把混乱的情况概括成一句话：“一个全国性的危机。”舆论纷纷攻击政府“失职”，国会里发出了一片要求调查“美国落后的原因”并追究责任的呼声。头脑比较冷静一点的评论员们得出了比较冷静的结论。李普曼说：“当发射苏联人造卫星的事件暴露出我们远远不是强有力的时候，我们的威信和影响大大地动摇了。”哈希指出，美国已经渡过了可以横行霸道的“历史时期”，今后将是“一个美国将逐渐地在比重上和数量上被超过的世界”。总之，美国纸老虎戳穿了，以美国为首的“自由国家”集团面临着进一步分裂的危险。
    为了缓和帝国主义阵营的这个严重危机，艾森豪威尔同麦克米伦进行了紧急会商。他们得出的一个主要结论是：必须设法恢复西方的“团结”和“信心”。按照这个打算，帝国主义大声鼓吹西方国家的“互相依靠”。
    北大西洋公约国家首脑会议据说就是要讨论加强“团结”和“合作”的问题。但是实际上，美国在英国的“合作”下，已经为这个会议拟定了一项计划，其主旨是“使每个盟国都要在实质上牺牲国家主权”。具体一点说，由美国更进一步控制西方国家，而给英国一个二等伙伴的地位。这个计划的初步透露，就已经在西欧的“盟国”中间引起了“不满”和“震惊”。巴黎首先表示反对美英想“把最有利的地位据为己有，而把一个不适当的地位留给法国”。西德的报纸评论表示，西德“不希望在下月北大西洋公约组织最高级会议上拜下风”。在北大西洋公约组织常设机构的每周例会上，其他一些国家的代表也表示了“忧虑”。这些事实正是对帝国主义阵营的“合作”和“团结”的最好的讽刺。
    为了安定人心，制止离心倾向的发展，美国还大事夸耀它的所谓“实力”。各种发言人都出来大谈美国的导弹和卫星“计划”。在火箭时代日渐陈旧的战略空军被拿出来进行表演。向“盟国”提供中程导弹的计划被广泛宣传，虽然连杜勒斯也承认，最早在明年底以前，美国还不会有可以应用的这种东西。美国总统还选定了从十月革命四十周年这个有历史意义的日子开始，发表一系列的讲话，给帝国主义阵营打气。
    从艾森豪威尔接连发表的一系列演说中可以看出，美国统治集团仍想尽可能保持国际紧张局势，并进一步加速军备竞赛。军费已决定大大增加，“少些牛油、多些大炮”的口号被官方发言人正式提了出来。美国统治集团仍企图用破产了的“实力地位”政策来挽救美国的危机，只是可怜的幻想而已。
