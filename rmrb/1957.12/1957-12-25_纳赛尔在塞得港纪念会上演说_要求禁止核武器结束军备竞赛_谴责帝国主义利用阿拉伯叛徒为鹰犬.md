    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 24th: Egyptian President Nasser said in Port Said on the 23rd: "The storage of atomic weapons, rockets, and hydrogen bombs in Europe and Turkey is a threat to us."

    He delivered a one-hour speech at a rally held at the Port Said stadium to celebrate the first anniversary of the withdrawal of the British and French invading forces from Port Said. He said that the Egyptian people, who have experienced war, are now calling on the world to commit to permanent peace in the world and the Middle East. He demanded a ban on nuclear weapons and called on all governments to end the Cold War and the arms race. He said: "Let us strive to eliminate the roots of war from the world, especially colonialism, national oppression, and racism."

    Nasser said: "Our victory in Port Said has brought significant results. We have victoriously defended our independence." He also said that this war was the first true victory of Arab nationalism.

    Nasser said that the psychological warfare waged by imperialism after the failure of armed aggression against Egypt, and the attempts to isolate Egypt and cut off its food supply, were aimed at eradicating "the ideas of demanding freedom, independence, and Arab nationalism." In this struggle, imperialism used their agents and traitors in the Arab world.

    Nasser said that the imperialists had employed Mortada al-Maraghi, the Minister of Interior during the reign of deposed Egyptian King Farouk, and Hussein al-Houli, a former royal family member currently in Beirut, to carry out subversive activities against Egypt. They attempted to recruit officers within Egypt to plot a coup. They contacted an Egyptian patriotic officer, Assam Eddine Mahmoud Khalil, who worked in the intelligence services. In the past year, these traitors gave this officer a total of 162,000 pounds as funds for engaging in conspiracy activities, but this officer handed the money over to the Egyptian government.

    Nasser announced that he was donating this money to Port Said and its people. He said this was "nationalizing the imperialist conspiracy," just as the Suez Canal Company was nationalized. He said that Officer Khalil had been awarded a medal of merit.

    Nasser expressed regret that some major powers are still adopting aggressive methods. He accused France of continuing to use NATO weapons to attack Algeria; he condemned some major powers for completely disregarding the rights of the Palestinian people. He expressed support for the right to self-determination of the people of Cyprus and Indonesia's struggle to liberate West Irian, as well as the struggle of the African people for the right to survival, equality, freedom, and independence.

    纳赛尔在塞得港纪念会上演说
    要求禁止核武器结束军备竞赛
    谴责帝国主义利用阿拉伯叛徒为鹰犬
    据新华社开罗24日电　埃及总统纳赛尔23日在塞得港说：“在欧洲和土耳其贮藏原子武器、火箭和氢弹是对我们的一个威胁。”
    他在塞得港运动场上向庆祝英法侵略军撤出塞得港一周年的大会发表了历时一小时的演说。他说，曾经经历过战争的埃及人民现在向全世界呼吁致力于世界和中东的永久和平。他要求禁止核武器，并且要求所有的政府结束冷战和军备竞赛。他说：“让我们努力从世界上消除战争根源，特别是殖民主义、民族压迫和种族主义。”
    纳赛尔说：“我们在塞得港的胜利带来了重大的成果。我们胜利地保卫了我们的独立。”他还说，这次战争是阿拉伯民族主义第一次真正的胜利。
    纳赛尔说，帝国主义在武装侵略埃及失败之后进行的神经战和企图使埃及孤立、断粮的斗争，目的在于铲除“要求自由、独立和阿拉伯民族主义的思想”。在这场斗争中，帝国主义利用了他们的代理人和阿拉伯世界的叛徒。
    纳赛尔说，帝国主义者曾经雇用了埃及被废黜的国王法鲁克统治时期的内政大臣马尔塔达·毛鲁吉、前皇族成员、目前在贝鲁特的侯赛尼·扈利对埃及进行颠复活动。他们企图在埃及内部招募军官来策划政变。他们同一个埃及爱国军官、在情报机关工作的阿萨姆·埃迪奈·马穆德·哈利勒接洽。在过去一年中，这些叛徒一共给这个军官十六万二千镑作为从事阴谋活动的费用，可是这个军官把这笔钱交给埃及政府了。
    纳赛尔宣布把这笔钱赠送给塞得港及其人民。他说，这是“把帝国主义阴谋收归国有”，正如把苏伊士运河公司收归国有一样。他说，军官哈利勒已经被授予功劳勋章。
    纳赛尔对于有些大国仍然采取侵略手段表示遗憾。他指责法国继续在使用北大西洋公约组织的武器进攻阿尔及利亚；他谴责有些大国根本无视巴勒斯坦人民的权利。他表示支持塞浦路斯人民的自决权和印度尼西亚解放西伊里安的斗争，以及非洲人民争取生存权利和平等、自由、独立的斗争。
