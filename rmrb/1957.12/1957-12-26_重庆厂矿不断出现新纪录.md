    Chongqing Factories and Mines Constantly Achieve New Records
    (Our Chongqing dispatch, December 25th) A new production upsurge is forming in Chongqing's factories, mines, enterprises, basic construction, and transportation departments. In November, the total output value of sixty-five key factories and mines increased by 15.79% compared to the same period last year, exceeding the plan by 8.29%. Currently, more than forty units have completed their annual state plans ahead of schedule.
    Recently, new production records have been continuously emerging in various factories and mines. The open-hearth furnace workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company recently created the highest production record since the furnace was opened in 1954. Workers in the assembly workshop of Chongqing Machine Tool Factory are able to overfulfill their quota every day, becoming a workshop that is "red all day long." In the cotton workshop of the Southwest First Silk Textile Factory, 70% of the machines have exceeded the December production quota; 40% of the silk reeling machines in the silk reeling workshop have produced unprecedented high-grade silk. Tianfu Coal Mine had failed to complete the state plan from January to July this year. After launching the rectification campaign in September, it overfulfilled the production plan every month. Workers in the No. 1 and No. 3 mines created a total of 158 new production records in November.
    This new production upsurge has a more solid foundation than the advanced producer movement in early 1956. First, the broad masses of workers and staff have received profound education in the rectification movement, and their class consciousness and labor enthusiasm have been unprecedentedly high. Second, many factories and mines have solved many key production problems in the entire factory and workshops during the rectification and reform period, removing many obstacles in production. Third, the democratic atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism during the rectification movement has been unprecedentedly promoted. The work style of Party, government, and trade union cadres has greatly improved.
    Recently, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed leading cadres of various factories and mines to actively organize and lead this new production upsurge. The main problem at present is that a small number of leading cadres in some enterprises have insufficient understanding of the emergence of the new production upsurge and have not seriously organized and led it. The Municipal Committee instructed all factories and mines to quickly change this situation. (Ding Fan, Li Ce)

    重庆厂矿不断出现新纪录
    本报重庆25日电　重庆各厂矿企业和基本建设、交通运输部门新的生产高潮正在形成。11月份六十五个重点厂矿的总产值比去年同期增长15.79％，超过计划8.29％。目前，已经有四十多个单位提前完成了全年国家计划。
    近来，各厂矿企业不断出现生产新纪录。重庆钢铁公司大型平炉车间最近创造了1954年开炉以来的最高生产纪录。重庆机床厂装配车间的工人每天都能超额完成定额工作量，成为日日“满堂红”的车间。西南第一丝纺厂制棉车间已经有70％的车台突破了12月份的生产定额；立缫车间40％的车台出现了空前未有的高级丝。天府煤矿今年一至七月份一直没有完成国家计划，9月份开展整风运动以后，月月超额完成生产计划，一、三井工人在11月份共创造生产新纪录一百五十八人次。
    这次新的生产高潮比1956年初的先进生产者运动具有更踏实的基础。第一、广大职工群众在整风运动中受到了深刻的教育，阶级觉悟和劳动热情空前高涨。第二、许多厂矿企业在整改期间解决了许多全厂和车间的重大生产关键问题，扫除了生产上的重重障碍。第三、整风期间批评和自我批评的民主空气空前发扬。党、政和工会干部的作风有了很大的进步。
    最近，中共重庆市委指示各厂矿企业领导干部积极组织和领导这一新的生产高潮。当前主要问题是某些企业中的少数领导干部对新的生产高潮的出现认识不足，没有认真加以组织领导。市委指示各厂矿迅速改变这一情况。　　　　　　　（丁帆、李策）
