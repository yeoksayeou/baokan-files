Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 1st: Since its liberation, Romania has received multifaceted assistance from the Soviet Union in its socialist construction.

　　Up to July of this year, the Soviet Union had supplied Romania with complete sets of equipment for fifty-six industrial enterprises. The Soviet Union also supplies Romania with a large amount of industrial raw materials every year. Last year, Romania's imports of iron ore from the Soviet Union accounted for 75% of all iron ore imports, coke accounted for 60%, steel plates accounted for 75%, and all imported pig iron was supplied by the Soviet Union. This year, the Soviet Union has already supplied Romania with more than 300,000 tons of coke, 450,000 tons of iron ore, 350,000 tons of steel, and 13,000 tons of non-ferrous metals, etc.

　　Thanks to the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, Romania's machine-building industry has developed rapidly. Before liberation, this industrial sector could only supply less than 5% of the machinery and equipment needed by domestic industry, but now 60% of the machinery in the country is manufactured domestically. In addition, many products of Romania's machine-building industry have been sold far and wide to countries along the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

　　Romania's main industrial sector, the oil industry, has also received enormous assistance from the Soviet Union. Since liberation, the Soviet Union has supplied Romania with a great deal of drilling, refining and other equipment. With the help of Soviet experts, this industrial sector has also adopted the most advanced Soviet geophysical prospecting methods, rapid drilling methods, and rational oil extraction methods. With these Soviet assistance, Romania has discovered thirty-three new oil-bearing structures, fifty-two oil and gas seepages in recent years. At present, the country's proven oil reserves have doubled compared to 1950, and oil production has increased from 3.83 million tons in 1947 to 10.92 million tons last year.

　　Not long ago, the Soviet Union helped Romania build Romania's first atomic reactor, providing favorable conditions for Romania's peaceful use of atomic energy.

　　Currently, Romania is also building huge chemical fertilizer factories, synthetic rubber factories, hydropower stations, thermal power stations, textile factories, etc. with the help of the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 1st: Poland, after its liberation, received comprehensive and selfless assistance from the Soviet Union and has transformed from a country severely damaged by war into an industrial nation. In terms of industrial output per capita, Poland has surpassed Italy and is almost on par with France.

　　In the past thirteen years, the Soviet Union has helped Poland build twenty-four large and medium-sized industrial enterprises, distributed throughout the country's provinces. These enterprises were all designed by the Soviet Union and equipped with Soviet machinery, and their scale and novelty of equipment are unprecedented in Polish history.

　　The Lenin Metallurgical Combine, which began construction on a barren field six years ago, has already produced nearly one million tons of steel for People's Poland this year. When this enterprise is fully completed, it will produce 1.5 million tons of steel annually, exceeding Poland's pre-war annual national steel production. This enterprise is entirely equipped with modern Soviet machinery. An American steel expert, after visiting this enterprise recently, also believed that the United States today has very few such automated steel plants. In the northeast suburbs of Warsaw, the huge Warsaw High-Quality Steel Smelting Plant, with world-class technology, is under construction. It will be put into production in the next few months, producing the first batch of high-quality steel for the Polish national economy. In addition, there is the Warsaw Small Car Factory with a production capacity of 30,000 cars per year, the Lublin Truck Factory, Poland's first modern aluminum factory, and agricultural machinery manufacturing plants which have already been built. The Warsaw Electric Heating Plant, one of the largest electric heating plants in Europe, is also under construction.

　　According to the long-term Soviet-Polish economic agreement, the Soviet Union has always supplied Poland with the most important industrial raw materials. For example, the iron ore needed by Poland's steel industry is mainly supplied by the Soviet Union. Poland's textile industry receives tens of thousands of tons of cotton from the Soviet Union every year, and the chemical industry cannot do without Soviet raw materials. It can be said that in the past thirteen years, there has not been a single industrial sector in Poland that has not received assistance from the Soviet Union. In addition, the Soviet Union has also trained many experts for Poland. From 1951 to 1956 alone, more than 1,000 Polish experts interned in the Soviet Union.

　　From 1944 to 1948, the Soviet Union aided Poland with a total of 2.8 million tons of grain, saving the Polish people from starvation in the face of severe war damage. Last November, as a result of talks between the Soviet and Polish governments, the Soviet Union agreed to supply Poland with 1.4 million tons of grain and a long-term loan of 700 million rubles. In addition, the Soviet Union also agreed that the outstanding portion of Soviet loans borrowed by Poland before November 1, 1956 (approximately 2 billion rubles) did not need to be repaid. This once again proves the Soviet Union's brotherly sincere and selfless assistance to Poland.

    兄弟国家情同手足
　　罗波两国得到苏联巨大援助
    新华社布加勒斯特1日电罗马尼亚自从解放以来，在社会主义建设事业中获得了苏联的多方面的援助。
    到今年7月为止，苏联已经供应了罗马尼亚五十六项工业企业的成套设备。苏联每年还供应罗马尼亚大批工业原料。去年，罗马尼亚从苏联进口的铁矿砂占全部进口铁矿砂的75％，焦炭占60％，钢板占75％，进口的生铁全部是苏联供应的。今年，苏联已经供应了罗马尼亚三十多万吨焦炭、四十五万吨铁矿砂、三十五万吨钢材和一万三千吨有色金属等。
    由于苏联的无私援助，罗马尼亚的机器制造业获得了迅速的发展。解放前，这个工业部门仅能供应国内工业所需的机器设备不到5％，而现在，全国工业的60％的机器都是本国制造的了。此外，罗马尼亚机器制造业的许多产品已经远销到大西洋和印度洋沿岸的国家。
    罗马尼亚的主要工业部门石油工业也得到了苏联的巨大帮助。解放以后，苏联供给了罗马尼亚许多钻探、炼油等设备。这个工业部门还在苏联专家的帮助下采用了苏联最先进的地球物理勘探法、快速钻井法和合理的采油法等。在苏联的这些援助下，罗马尼亚近年来发现了三十三个新的储油结构、五十二处油苗和沼气苗。目前全国已经探明的石油蕴藏量比1950年增加了一倍，石油产量已经由1947年的三百八十三万吨提高到去年的一千零九十二万吨。
    不久以前，苏联帮助罗马尼亚建成了罗马尼亚的第一座原子反应堆，为罗马尼亚的和平利用原子能的工作提供了有利条件。
    目前，罗马尼亚还正在苏联帮助下建设巨大的化学肥料工厂、人造橡胶工厂、水电站、热电站、纺织工厂等。
    新华社华沙1日电　波兰在解放以后得到了苏联的全面无私的援助，已经从一个受到战争严重破坏的国家变成一个工业国。在按人口计算的工业产量方面，波兰已经超过意大利，而和法国差不多。
    过去十三年中，苏联帮助波兰建设了二十四个大、中型的工业企业，分布在全国各省。这些企业都是由苏联设计并且用苏联机器装备起来的，它们的规模之大，装备之新，都是波兰历史上从来没有过的。
    六年前开始在一片荒原上建设的列宁冶金联合企业今年已为人民波兰生产了近百万吨钢。这个企业完全建成后，每年将生产一百五十万吨钢，超过波兰战前每年全国的钢产量。这个企业完全是用苏联现代化的机器设备装备起来的。一位美国钢铁专家不久前在参观这个企业时，也认为今天的美国极少如此自动化的钢铁厂。在华沙东北郊，正在建设具有世界第一流技术水平的巨大的华沙优质钢冶炼厂。它将在最近几个月内投入生产，为波兰国民经济生产第一批优质钢。此外已经建成的有设备能力年产三万辆汽车的华沙小汽车工厂、卢布林卡车工厂、波兰第一个现代化的制铝工厂、农业机器制造厂等。正在建设的还有欧洲最大的电热厂之一的华沙电热厂。　　根据波苏长期经济协定，苏联一直供给波兰最重要的工业原料，如波兰钢铁工业所需的铁矿砂，就主要是靠苏联供应的，波兰纺织工业每年从苏联获得数万吨棉花，化学工业也离不了苏联的原料。可以说，十三年来，波兰没有一个工业部门没有得到过苏联的援助。此外，苏联还为波兰培养了许多专家。仅在1951年到1956年期间，就有一千多名波兰专家到苏联实习。
    从1944年到1948年，苏联共援助了波兰二百八十万吨粮食，使波兰人民在严重的战争破坏情况下免于饥饿。去年11月，波苏两国会谈的结果，苏联又答应供给波兰一百四十万吨谷物和七亿卢布的长期贷款。此外，苏联还同意波兰在1956年11月1日以前所借的苏联贷款未偿还部分（约二十亿卢布）可以不必偿还。这又一次证明了苏联对波兰的兄弟般的真诚无私的援助。
