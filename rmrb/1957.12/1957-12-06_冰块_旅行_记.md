A Record of Ice Cube’s "Journey"
　　He Xing
    During the hot summer this year, Li Shaoyan, the deputy chief of the administrative section of the Li Yingzi Mine of the Huainan Coal Mine, went to Jinan on a business trip. After eating a cup of ice cream, he felt refreshed. Thinking of the issue of heatstroke prevention and cooling at the mine, he quickly went to the Jinan Ice Factory and spent 2.5 yuan to buy two large blocks of ice, to be sent to Huainan for cooling.

    Buying ice was easy, but the railway transportation became a headache for this section chief. He used straw sacks and wooden boxes, sweating profusely, but the ice still kept melting. So he bought some sawdust to fill the box, but the water still kept flowing. What to do? The section chief thought hard and finally came up with a brilliant idea: put two more iron boxes outside the wooden box, and then he felt relieved and entrusted the goods to the transportation station to be sent to Jinan Railway Station, beginning the long journey. The freight dispatcher was happy for him for the ingenious method he had thought of for heatstroke prevention and cooling. Back at the hotel, he wrote a registered letter to the mine reporting the situation. After the letter was sent, he thought that the mail might be too slow, so he rushed to the post office to send a telegram to the mine, reporting "Ice cubes have been shipped, quickly send a car to Caijiagang Station to pick them up." These two blocks of ice traveled from Jinan to Huainan, crossed Mount Tai and Niutou Mountain, passed through Yanzhou and Xuzhou, crossed the Huaihe River Iron Bridge, transferred from the Jinpu Railway to the Huainan branch line, and after two days and two nights, traveled more than 1,200 li, finally arriving at Caijiagang Station. The comrades at Caijiagang Station opened the freight car and were shocked, asking the person picking up the goods: What "strange cargo" are you transporting that made the whole carriage full of water? The person picking up the goods opened the box, but could not find an answer, because besides the water-soaked wood shavings and rice straw, there was nothing else in the box.

    Section Chief Li took dozens of receipts to the finance section for reimbursement. Packaging fees, wooden box fees, iron box fees, sawdust fees, label fees, transportation station fees, train transportation fees, loading and unloading fees, handling fees, service fees, registered mail postage, telegram fees... totaling 159.96 yuan.

    The incident happened in July. The kind-hearted head of the finance section thought it would be difficult to refuse, so he silently reimbursed the full amount and charged it to the cost of coal. If it hadn't been for the rectification campaign in the enterprise this time, with everyone speaking out freely, no one would have known about such a strange thing!

　　冰块“旅行”记
　　鹤兴
    今年炎热的夏天，淮南煤矿李郢孜一矿行政科副科长李绍严出差到济南，在吃完一杯冰淇淋后，觉得一身凉快，他想起了矿上的防暑降温问题，便赶快跑到济南制冰厂，花了二元五角钱买了两大块冰砖，送到淮南来降温。
    买冰倒很容易，但是铁路运输却伤了这位科长的脑筋，他又用草包又装木箱，累得汗流满面，但是冰还是不停的流水。于是他又买了一些锯末填在箱中，但水仍然流个不停。怎么办呢？这个科长左思右想，最后终于想到了一条妙法，在木箱外面再套上两个铁皮箱，这才心安意得地把这个货托运输站运到济南车站，开始了长途旅行。货运出了他为他在防暑降温中所想的天才办法而感到高兴，回到旅馆，写了一封挂号信向矿上报告情况。信发出后，他又考虑到邮递太慢，又赶忙奔赴邮局向矿里拍了一个电报，报告“冰块已经发运，速派汽车到蔡家岗车站拉运”。这两块冰从济南到淮南，越过了泰山和牛头山，经过了兖州和徐州，渡过了淮河大铁桥，从津浦干线转入淮南支线，过了两天两夜，走了一千二百多里，终于来到了蔡家岗车站。蔡家岗车站的同志打开货物车，大吃一惊，问提货人：你们运的什么“奇怪的货物”弄得一车厢都是水。提货人打开箱子，并没有找到答案，因为箱子里除了被水浸湿的木屑和稻草以外，再也找不到什么。
    李科长拿了几十张单据到财务科报销。包装费、木箱费、铁箱费、锯末费、标签费、运输站运输费、火车运输、装卸费、搬运费、服务费、挂号信邮资、电报费、……共计一百五十九元九角六分。
    事情发生在7月份，好心肠的财务科长认为情面难违，不声不响，如数报销、打入煤炭成本。若不是这次企业中开展整风，大放大鸣，把它揭露出来，大家还不知道会有这样的奇事呢！
