The True Face of American Protection of Dutch Colonialists
　　Liang Shu

On the issue of Indonesia's demand to restore sovereignty over West Irian, the United States once put on a pose of "just" "mediator". Back in March of last year, Dulles told reporters in Jakarta that he "wanted to take an impartial neutral stance" on the West Irian issue. Recently, when the UN General Assembly voted on the West Irian issue proposal, the US representative abstained, and Dulles also called it a "neutral" performance.

However, this clumsy disguise of the United States cannot deceive people.

People know that when the UN General Assembly voted on the West Irian issue proposal, the United States had already gathered its partners and formed a majority vote advantage, thereby rejecting the proposal to negotiate on the West Irian issue. Now, when the Indonesian people are launching a struggle with vigorous practical actions to liberate West Irian, the American mask has been torn off. It has taken steps to openly interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs. On December 5, US State Department spokesman White said: US Ambassador to Indonesia, Allison, may have issued a "resolute warning!" to the Indonesian government. Subsequently, the US Embassy, ​​together with the British and Australian Embassies, exerted pressure on Indonesia, ostensibly to play a "moderating role" in the situation. "Moderate" what? To ease the blow suffered by the Dutch colonial forces.

Looking back at the historical facts of the West Irian issue, the vicious face of American colonialism can be seen more clearly.

The reason why the Netherlands was able to continue to occupy West Irian after Indonesia gained independence was primarily because it received support from the United States. When the two military actions funded by the United States to eliminate the newly born Indonesia failed, the Netherlands had to hold "round table conference" negotiations with Indonesia in The Hague. This negotiation was conducted under the direct intervention and manipulation of the United States. The meeting decided to postpone the "transfer issue" of West Irian, to which Indonesia had a natural right, for another year, and the Netherlands has since refused to negotiate. This is the origin of the West Irian issue.

At that time, the American representative Cochrane, who intervened in the dispute between the Netherlands and Indonesia, was a veteran in American conspiracies in Indonesia. He served as the Consul General in Batavia (i.e., Jakarta) in the 1920s. Cochrane became the US Ambassador to Indonesia after the "round table conference". A year later, when negotiations were held in The Hague, according to the "round table conference" agreement, to "transfer" West Irian to Indonesia, Cochrane went to The Hague and openly stated that the US State Department did not agree with Indonesia's "straightforward" demands. It was reported that Cochrane also promised the Dutch government that the United States would fully support it if Indonesia used force. In 1954, US representative to the Geneva Conference, Under Secretary of State Smith, met with Dutch Foreign Minister Luns and once again affirmed US support for the Netherlands. According to Agence France-Presse: "They insisted that West Irian should be supervised by the Netherlands."

In 1955, when Masjumi's Harahap served as the Indonesian Prime Minister, Dulles promised Dutch Foreign Minister Luns that the United States would help the Netherlands by putting pressure on the Harahap cabinet. At that time, Indonesian newspapers exposed the conspiracy of the United States and the Netherlands to turn West Irian into a military base of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

In May of last year, when President Sukarno visited the United States, Dulles openly and formally announced that the United States did not intend to support Indonesia on the West Irian issue.

The United States has not only repeatedly expressed its support for Dutch colonial rule over West Irian, but also provided material assistance to the Dutch authorities entrenched in West Irian. Indonesian parliamentarian and member of the West Irian Executive Board, Papale, revealed that the United States had supplied a batch of amphibious aircraft to the Netherlands for suppressing the national movement of the West Irian people demanding reunification with their motherland.

The consistent US support for the Dutch occupation of West Irian fully exposes it as the center of world reactionary forces and a bastion of maintaining colonialism. Without the support of US imperialism, it would be impossible for the Netherlands, a country in Western Europe with a population of only eleven million, to maintain its aggression against Indonesia, a major Asian country with a population of eighty-two million.

The main reason why the United States supports the Dutch colonialists is that it tries to maintain the colonial system, and it is extremely hostile to the struggles of Asian and African countries for freedom and independence. "New York Times" commentator Baldwin even insulted Indonesia, saying that it "is not a country" "in the full sense of the term nation." And the US support for the Dutch occupation of West Irian is also a prelude to its undermining of Indonesian independence. As Indonesia's "Pendorong Daily" said: "West Irian is a gun pointed at the heart of Indonesia by the Netherlands and the United States." Facts have proved that the United States has continuously instigated and participated in subversive activities against Indonesia.

Supporting the Dutch occupation of West Irian is also a component of the US plan to prepare for aggressive war in Asia. According to Reuters, after the United States launched the Korean War, Truman met with MacArthur on Wake Island and agreed that a solid military base should be established in West Irian, and this point was notified to the Dutch government. Therefore, the Netherlands has repeatedly given the United States assurances to establish military bases in West Irian in order to obtain continued US support. "New York Times" commentator Baldwin also revealed that the United States coveted the strategic position of West Irian. He pointed out that agreeing to Indonesia's recovery of West Irian "is strategically insane."

It can be seen that the ambition of the United States on the West Irian issue is extremely vicious. However, due to the rising national liberation movements of the Asian and African people and the increasing unpopularity of colonialism, the United States has to adopt more cunning and covert means when carrying out colonial aggression. The reason why the United States wants to pretend to be a fair "mediator" is to try to please both sides in order to reap the benefits and squeeze out the interests of the old-fashioned colonialists and expand its own sphere of influence. In recent years, while supporting Dutch colonial rule over West Irian, the United States has been squeezing out Dutch colonial interests in West Irian step by step. According to statistics, US investment in the West Irian oil industry has risen to 60%. The United States is also extracting other minerals in large quantities, including uranium.

Ridiculously, some American newspapers, such as the "New York Post," are still boasting: "The United States has used diplomatic means very skillfully on the West Irian issue." But facts prove that no matter how eloquent the United States is, it cannot cover up its vicious colonial face in West Irian. The Indonesian people know who their friends are and who their enemies are. "Gemini Newspaper" asked people not to be "deceived" by the US tactics, "The United States cannot help Indonesia get back West Irian." With the support of peace-loving and just humanity all over the world, the Indonesian people will surely be able to restore their sovereignty over West Irian.

　　美国庇护荷兰殖民者的真面目
　　梁恕
    在印度尼西亚要求恢复对西伊里安主权的问题上，美国曾经装出一副“公正”的“调解人”的姿态。去年3月间杜勒斯在雅加达就曾对记者表示，在西伊里安问题上，他“想采取一种不偏不倚的中立立场”。最近在联大表决西伊里安问题的提案时，美国代表弃权，杜勒斯也把它称为“中立”的表现。
    但是，美国这种拙劣的伪装，是迷惑不了人的。
    人们知道，当联大表决西伊里安问题提案时，美国已经纠集了它的伙伴，形成了占多数票的优势，从而否决了就西伊里安问题进行谈判的提案。现在当印度尼西亚人民以有力的实际行动为解放西伊里安展开斗争的时候，美国假面具就撕破了。它采取了公开干涉印度尼西亚内政的步骤。12月5日，美国国务院发言人怀特说：美国驻印度尼西亚的大使艾利逊，可能已经对印度尼西亚政府提出了“毅然的告戒！”随后，美国大使馆更联合了英国和澳大利亚大使馆对印度尼西亚施加压力，而美其名是要对局势起一种“缓和作用”。“缓和”什么？缓和荷兰殖民势力所受到的打击。
    回顾一下西伊里安问题的历史事实，更可以清楚地看出美国殖民主义的凶恶面目。
    荷兰所以能够在印度尼西亚取得独立之后，仍然侵占着西伊里安，首先是由于它得到美国的支持。当美国资助荷兰企图消灭新生的印度尼西亚的两次军事行动遭到失败后，荷兰不得不和印度尼西亚在海牙举行“圆桌会议”的谈判。这次谈判是在美国直接的干预和操纵之下进行的。这次会议决定把印度尼西亚享有当然权利的西伊里安的“移交问题”，留到一年之后再行谈判，而荷兰从此一直拒绝谈判。这就是西伊里安问题的由来。
    在那个时候，干预荷兰和印度尼西亚争端的美国代表柯契伦，是一个美国在印度尼西亚进行阴谋活动的老手。他曾在二十年代担任驻巴达维亚（即雅加达）总领事。柯契伦在“圆桌会议”以后就担任了美国驻印度尼西亚的大使。一年以后，按照“圆桌会议”协定在海牙谈判把西伊里安“移交”给印度尼西亚的时候，柯契伦到了海牙，他公开表示美国国务院不同意印度尼西亚所提出的“直率”的要求。据报道，柯契伦还答应荷兰政府，如果印度尼西亚使用武力的时候，美国将全力支持它。1954年美国参加日内瓦会议的代表、副国务卿史密斯曾经同荷兰外长伦斯会谈，又一次肯定了美国对荷兰的支持。据法新社报道：“他们坚持西伊里安应为荷兰所监督”。
    1955年，当马斯友美党人哈拉哈普担任印度尼西亚总理的时候，杜勒斯曾经答应荷兰外长伦斯，美国将通过对哈拉哈普内阁施加压力来帮助荷兰。当时印度尼西亚报纸揭露了美国、荷兰企图把西伊里安变成东南亚条约组织的军事基地的阴谋。
    去年5月，当苏加诺总统在美国访问的时候，杜勒斯更公然正式宣布：在西伊里安问题上，美国不打算支持印度尼西亚。
    美国不仅一再表示支持荷兰对西伊里安的殖民统治，而且对盘踞在西伊里安的荷兰当局也给予物资上的支援。印度尼西亚国会议员、西伊里安执行局委员帕帕勒就曾揭露，美国已经把一批水陆两用飞机供给荷兰，用于镇压西伊里安人民要求合并于祖国的民族运动。
    美国对荷兰侵占西伊里安的一贯支持，充分暴露它是世界反动势力的中心，维护殖民主义的堡垒。如果没有美帝国主义的支持，远在西欧的人口只有一千一百万的荷兰是决不可能保持对拥有八千二百万人口的亚洲大国印度尼西亚的侵略行为的。
    美国之所以支持荷兰殖民者，主要原因在于它力图维护殖民制度，它对亚非各国争取自由独立的斗争是十分仇视的。“纽约时报”评论员鲍德温甚至侮辱印度尼西亚“从国家一词的充分意义来说”，“并不是一个国家”。而美国支持荷兰侵占西伊里安的行动，也就是它破坏印度尼西亚独立的前奏。正如印度尼西亚的“推动者日报”所说：“西伊里安是荷兰和美国指向印度尼西亚心脏的一支枪”。事实证明，美国不断地指使和参与了对印度尼西亚进行的颠覆活动。
    支持荷兰侵占西伊里安，也是美国在亚洲准备侵略战争计划的一个组成部分。据路透社报道，美国发动朝鲜战争以后，杜鲁门曾到威克岛和麦克阿瑟会晤，同意应该在西伊里安建立强固的军事基地，并且把这一点通知了荷兰政府。因此荷兰也就一再给予美国在西伊里安建立军事基地的保证，以便取得美国的继续支持。“纽约时报”评论员鲍德温也曾经透露美国垂涎西伊里安的战略地位。他指出：同意印度尼西亚收回西伊里安“就是在战略上发了疯”。
    由此可见，美国在西伊里安问题上的野心是十分恶毒的。但是，由于亚非人民民族解放运动日益高涨，殖民主义日益不得人心，美国在进行殖民侵略时也不得不采取更为狡猾和隐蔽的手段。美国之所以要装扮成公正的“调解人”是企图两面讨好，以便渔翁得利，排挤老牌殖民主义者的利益，扩展自己的势力范围。近年来，美国在支持荷兰对西伊里安殖民统治的同时，已经一步步地排挤了荷兰在西伊里安的殖民利益。据统计，在西伊里安的石油企业中美国的投资已上升到占60％。美国还在大量开采其他矿产，其中包括铀。
    可笑的是，美国有些报纸，如“纽约邮报”，还在吹嘘：“美国在西伊里安问题上的外交手段使用得很技巧”。但事实证明，不管美国如何花言巧语，它对西伊里安的凶恶的殖民面貌是掩盖不住的。印度尼西亚人民知道谁是他们的朋友，谁是他们的敌人。“宝石报”要求人们不要为美国的手腕所“迷惑”，“美国不可能帮助印度尼西亚要回西伊里安”。在全世界爱好和平和正义的人类支持下，印度尼西亚人民一定能够恢复对西伊里安的主权。
