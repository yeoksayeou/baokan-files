Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 1st: President Nasser said on November 30th that any aggression against one Arab country would be an aggression against the entire Arab world.

Representatives from various countries attending the Arab Chamber of Commerce, Agriculture, and Industry Conference in Cairo paid their respects to President Nasser at the Presidential Palace after the conference's closing. Nasser told the representatives, "Arab unity will always be victorious, despite attempts to oppose it."

The Egyptian President said: "Arab nationalism is extremely necessary to protect Arabs from aggression and plunder. The victory of Arab nationalism will thwart all the conspiracies of those who covet Arab wealth, land, and freedom."

Nasser said that Arab nationalism is now realizing its ideals—the unity, strength, independence, freedom, and improved living standards of Arab countries.

Xinhua News Agency, December 1st: TASS, Paris: "Le Figaro" published on November 30th the second article by Max Clos commenting on the reasons for the serious failure of Western policies in Arab countries. Based on his personal observations, Clos pointed out that in Arab countries, the idea of liberation is becoming increasingly deeply rooted.

Clos pointed out that all of America's proposals for "aid" to Arab countries are attached with various political conditions that insult the national dignity of Arabs, while "the Russians do not mention any conditions." Clos believes that "the reason for the failure of American policy is precisely this." He pointed out that Soviet policy attracts the hearts of the people of Arab countries, which is the main success of the Soviet Union, and this success is "much more important than supplying weapons or concluding economic agreements."

　　纳赛尔警告侵略者不要乱动
　  强调阿拉伯团结将永远胜利
    新华社开罗1日电　纳赛尔总统11月30日说，对一个阿拉伯国家的任何侵略，将是对整个阿拉伯世界的侵略。
    参加在开罗举行的阿拉伯商会、农业和工业会议的各国代表在会议闭幕后到总统府向纳赛尔致敬。纳赛尔对代表们说，“阿拉伯团结将永远是胜利的，尽管有人企图反对它。”
    埃及总统说：“阿拉伯民族主义对于保护阿拉伯人不受到侵略和掠夺是极其必要的。阿拉伯民族主义的胜利将挫败那些贪图阿拉伯财富、土地和自由的人的一切阴谋。”
    纳赛尔说，阿拉伯民族主义现在正在实现它的理想——阿拉伯国家的团结、强大、独立、自由和生活水平的提高。
    据新华社1日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：“费加罗报”11月30日刊载了马克斯·克洛评论西方国家政策在阿拉伯国家遭到严重失败的原因的第二篇文章。克洛根据他亲身所见，指出在阿拉伯国家中，要求解放的思想愈来愈深入人心。
    克洛指出，美国的一切“援助”阿拉伯国家的建议都附带有各式各样的侮辱阿拉伯人的民族尊严的政治条件，而“俄国人却不提任何条件”。克洛认为，“美国政策之所以失败正是由于这个缘故”。他指出，苏联政策吸引了阿拉伯国家的人心，这是苏联的主要成功，而这种成功“比起供应武器或者缔结经济协定重要得多”。
