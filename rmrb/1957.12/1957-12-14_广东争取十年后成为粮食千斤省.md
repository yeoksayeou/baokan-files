Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 12th. What specific measures should be taken to strive to achieve the goal of becoming a grain province producing 1,000 jin per mu in ten years? The Second Session of the First Guangdong Provincial Party Congress has focused on studying this important issue.

The conference basically approved the draft of Guangdong's twelve-year agricultural development plan. According to this draft plan, in the next ten years, the average grain yield per mu in Guangdong Province should be increased from the current 510 jin to 900 jin, striving to reach 1,000 jin, and the total output should be increased from 24.5 billion jin to 43.2 billion jin, striving to reach 48 billion jin; the sugarcane yield per mu should be increased from 5,500 jin to 10,000 jin, and the total output should be increased from 7.96 billion jin to 50 billion jin; the social inventory of pigs should be increased from 8.1 million heads to 30 million heads, with an average of four heads per household; the province's tropical and subtropical crops will develop rapidly; the entire province will be greened; and the output of aquatic products will be increased from 580,000 tons to 2.5 million tons, equivalent to the total output of the country this year; basically eliminate the four pests. Among these indicators, grain production is of decisive significance. The policy of focusing on increasing grain production in agricultural production in the next ten years must be adhered to.

All the delegates to the conference were encouraged by this revolutionary plan and enthusiastically discussed what specific measures to take to achieve this plan, especially the grain target. Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, said in his summary that whether this plan can be realized depends on whether we can cross a "barrier" during the Second Five-Year Plan period, that is, whether we can basically eliminate droughts and ordinary floods, basically achieve three crops a year, completely transform backward fields, fully implement advanced agricultural technology reforms, and obtain reliable and sufficient fertilizer sources; and whether we can ensure a stable agricultural production situation, so that grain crops can reach an average yield of 700 jin per mu by 1962, striving to reach 800 jin. If these requirements are met, then there will be a solid foundation for striving to become a grain province producing 1,000 jin per mu by 1967.

Tao Zhu especially emphasized the importance of doing a good job in water conservancy construction. He said that since liberation, agricultural production in Guangdong Province has generally been relatively stable, but it is not very stable, and every year a considerable number of areas still experience natural disasters of varying degrees. In the speeches of the delegates to the conference, it was also believed that for agricultural production to be very stable, it is first necessary to see whether the water conservancy barrier has been passed well. If the water conservancy barrier is passed well, production will be very stable, increasing production will be rapid, and work will be very active; the morale of the masses will be high, and the cooperatives will be relatively consolidated. Wherever the water conservancy barrier has not been passed, not only is agricultural production very unstable, but the work is very passive, and most of the cooperatives are not consolidated. In his summary, Tao Zhu said that of the 45 million mu of paddy fields in the province, about 85% currently have irrigation equipment, but most of them have drought resistance capacity of less than 30 days, and about 5 million mu of paddy fields are subject to varying degrees of water and drought disasters every year. In addition, there are still more than 7 million mu of "fields relying on the sky" without water conservancy equipment in the paddy fields, which cannot grow two crops of rice. Tao Zhu said that the current task is to require that within the next five years, all paddy fields have a drought resistance capacity of more than 40 days, and to transform 7 million mu of "fields relying on the sky" into paddy fields with water conservancy equipment within two or three years, so that the current 12 million mu of dry land have simple irrigation equipment (currently, only 3 million mu of dry land have simple irrigation equipment that can be watered). The method is to get water from the river, get water from the sky, and get water from the ground, comprehensively plan, and focus on building small-scale water conservancy projects (combined with large and medium-sized water conservancy projects). Xingning, Chenghai, Xinhui, Yangjiang and other counties, Hailing District of Yangjiang County, Pingtian Agricultural Cooperative of Hepu County, and Qiaotou Township of Wanning County are all examples of well-repaired water conservancy projects, and are all worthy of learning from throughout the province. Some counties, districts, and townships rely solely on building large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, and rely on the state to provide money for water conservancy, instead of using the method of mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses to do water conservancy themselves, which is not right. For large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, the state has already made a grand investment plan, and all localities should also immediately make comprehensive plans, with counties and large townships as units, and actively mobilize the masses to build small-scale water conservancy projects with the greatest enthusiasm. The conference has initially decided that in addition to agricultural cooperatives, Guangdong Province will raise at least 400 to 500 million yuan in funds to invest in water conservancy construction during the Second Five-Year Plan period. During this period, the first secretaries of party committees at all levels must personally grasp water conservancy.

In his summary, Tao Zhu also emphatically mentioned the importance of three crops a year and expanding the multiple cropping index. He said that this is a basic measure to enable Guangdong Province's agricultural production to achieve high output. Guangdong is blessed with a warm climate and can grow crops in all seasons, with very few areas with frost, and the frost period is very short. Therefore, to increase production, in addition to increasing the yield per unit area, it is necessary to make full use of the land and expand the multiple cropping index as much as possible. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, on the basis of doing a good job in water conservancy and developing fertilizer sources, we must change the remaining 6 million mu of single-crop fields and nearly 2 million mu of one-and-a-half-crop fields (i.e., intercropping between two seasons) into double-crop fields; about 37 million mu of fields in the province can be winter-planted. Last year, 15 million mu have been winter-planted. This winter, it is planned to expand 5 million mu on this basis, and expand another 13 million mu by 1962. If this is done, at least 4 billion jin of grain can be increased, which is equivalent to increasing the yield per mu by about 90 jin. That is to say, the existing yield of 510 jin per mu is increased to 600 jin. The facts in recent years have also clearly shown that the reason why Guangdong Province achieved a huge achievement of increasing grain production by 2 billion jin last year is because the expansion of winter planting and the change of farming system increased nearly 1 billion jin of grain. This year, the increase in production plan has not been completed, in addition to natural disasters, changing to economic crops and excessive private plots, etc., it is because the winter planting area has been reduced by nearly 5 million mu compared with last year, and the change of plowing has not been actively carried out, and some areas have even abandoned what has already been changed.

In the conference speeches, it was also mentioned more that the role of transforming backward fields and comprehensively implementing new agricultural technology reforms in increasing production. The current low-yielding fields with an output of less than 400 jin in Guangdong Province are probably no less than 10 million mu. If we seize the opportunity to improve the soil, increase fertilizer application and improve cultivation methods in two or three years, and can increase the average output to 600 jin per mu by 1967, this item alone can increase production by 2.5 billion jin. There are probably another 30 million mu of fields in the province that can be used to make articles in terms of technological reform. If all these fields can fully implement the advanced experience of Chaoshan, deep plowing and fine cultivation, and achieve a complete set of new cultivation technologies centered on small-plant dense planting, then it is entirely possible to increase the average yield per mu by 150 jin in five years, which can increase production by another 4.5 billion jin. Adding all of the above items together, by 1962, the average yield per mu of 48 million mu of grain crop cultivated land in the province will exceed 700 jin, striving to reach 800 jin, which is guaranteed. The problem now is that everything depends on human effort, and the above measures must be resolutely implemented.

The meeting decided to immediately organize a blitz movement to prepare for spring plowing production, and in a fighting posture, do a good job in preparing for all spring plowing production in the two months before spring plowing, in order to achieve a greater harvest than in 1956 next year, and to make a good start for the Second Five-Year Plan. The meeting required party committees at all levels to concentrate all possible manpower, financial resources, and materials to do a good job in agricultural production, and the party committee secretaries, especially the first secretaries, must delve into production and become experts, have ideals, have methods, not complain, not talk emptily, and be a foolish old man who can indeed move mountains. Leading cadres at all levels should have their own demonstration fields. Now there are already several thousand-jin counties in the province, and the number of thousand-jin townships and thousand-jin communes is even greater. Huiyang has created high-yielding fields with a yield of nearly 2,500 jin per mu this year, and all localities should strive to have high-yielding fields with a yield of 3,000 jin per mu next year. All localities must have high-yielding demonstration teams, communes, and townships for various crops, cultivate typical examples, grasp them tightly, continuously improve them, and gain experience to promote the general. This is a very important method of leading production, and party committees at all levels must do it seriously. We should transfer stronger cadres from the downsized cadres to the townships and communes to effectively strengthen the leadership of agricultural production, and the work of all departments should also obey the needs of agricultural production tasks and cooperate with agricultural production to carry out departmental work. The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Guangdong have decided to participate in labor in the cooperatives during the spring busy season next year, and it is estimated that 3 million workdays will be contributed throughout the year.

　　广东争取十年后成为粮食千斤省
    省委第一书记陶铸指出：如果在第二个五年计划期间基本上消灭旱灾和普通水灾，做到一年三熟，全部改造落后田和实行技术改革，使粮食达到亩产七百斤到八百斤，那么，到一九六七年争取成为粮食“千斤省”就有了牢靠的基础。
    新华社广州12日电  采取那些具体措施，来争取在十年后实现粮食“千斤省”的奋斗目标？中共广东省第一届代表大会第二次会议，曾经着重地研究了这个重大问题。
    这次会议基本上通过了广东省的十二年农业发展规划草案。根据这个规划草案，在今后十年内，广东省粮食平均每亩产量要由现在的五百一十斤提高到九百斤，争取达到一千斤，总产量由二百四十五亿斤提高到四百三十二亿斤，争取达到四百八十亿斤；甘蔗亩产量由五千五百斤提高到一万斤，总产量由七十九点六亿斤达到五百亿斤；猪的社会存量由八百一十万头提高到三千万头，平均每户四头；全省热带、亚热带作物将飞跃发展；全省将实现绿化；水产品产量由五十八万吨提高到二百五十万吨，相当于今年全国的总产量；基本上消灭四害。在这些指标中，粮食生产带有决定意义。今后十年农业生产以增产粮食为中心的方针必须坚持。
    大会全体代表受到这个革命计划的鼓舞，曾经热烈地讨论了采取什么具体措施来实现这个计划，特别是粮食指标的问题。省委第一书记陶铸在总结时说，能否实现这个计划，这要看我们在第二个五年计划期间能否跨过一道“关”，也就是能否做到基本上消灭旱灾和普通水灾，基本上做到一年三熟，全部改造落后田，全面实行先进的农业技术改革，获得可靠的充足的肥源；能否以此保证农业生产趋于稳定的局面，使粮食作物到1962年达到平均亩产七百斤，争取达到八百斤。这些要求达到了，那末，到1967年争取成为粮食“千斤省”就有了牢靠的基础。
    陶铸特别强调搞好水利建设的重要意义。他说，解放以来，广东省农业生产一般是比较稳定的，但也不是很稳定，每年仍有相当数量的地区出现不同程度的自然灾害。大会代表的发言中，也都认为农业生产要做到很稳定，首先要看水利这一关过好了没有，过好水利这一关，生产很稳定了，一切就好办。发言所举的事实证明，几年来凡是集中力量，以最大的决心与毅力解决了水利问题的社、乡、县，农业生产就很稳定，增产就很快，工作就很主动；群众情绪高，合作社也就比较巩固。凡是没有过水利关的，就不仅农业生产很不稳定，工作很被动，而且合作社大都不巩固。陶铸在总结中说，全省四千五百万亩水田，目前约有85％有灌溉设备，但大多数的抗旱能力在三十天以下，每年有五百万亩左右的稻田要受到不同程度的水旱灾害。此外，水田中仍有七百多万亩没有水利设备的“望天田”，不能种两季水稻。陶铸说，现在的任务就是要求在今后五年内，做到所有水田都具有四十天以上的抗旱能力，两三年内变七百万亩“望天田”为有水利设备的水田，做到使现在的一千二百万亩旱地都有简单的灌溉设备（目前有简单灌溉设备可以浇水的旱地只有三百万亩）。办法是向河要水，向天要水，向地要水，全面规划，以兴办小型水利为主（结合大、中型水利工程）。兴宁、澄海、新会、阳江等县，阳江县的海陵区，合浦县的平田农业社，万宁县的桥头乡，都是修好水利的榜样，都值得全省学习。有些县、区、乡还单纯靠修大、中型水利，靠国家拿钱办水利，不是用发动群众、依靠群众自己搞水利的办法是不对的。对于搞大、中型水利工程，国家已经作了宏伟的投资计划，各地也要立即做出全面规划，以县与大乡为单位，积极发动群众以最大的积极性来搞小型水利。大会已经初步决定除农业社以外，在第二个五年计划期内，广东省要至少自筹四亿到五亿元资金投到兴修水利方面去。在这期间，各级党委第一书记必须亲自抓水利。
    陶铸在总结时也强调地提到了一年三熟与扩大复种指数的重要性。他说，这是使广东省农业生产达到高额产量的基本措施。广东得天独厚，气候温暖，四季能种农作物，有霜的地区很少，而且霜期很短。因此，要做到增产，除了提高单位面积产量之外，就需要尽量利用土地，扩大复种指数。在第二个五年计划期内，我们要在搞好水利与开辟肥源的基础上，使现在尚存的六百万亩单造田和近二百万亩一造半的田（即两季间作）改为双造田；全省共约三千七百万亩田可以冬种，去年已冬种一千五百万亩，今冬计划在这个基础上扩大五百万亩，到1962年再扩大一千三百万亩。做到了这些，就可以至少增产粮食四十亿斤，即等于提高每亩产量约九十斤。也就是说，由现有的每亩产量五百一十斤提高到六百斤。几年来的事实也很清楚地说明：去年广东省所以能取得增产粮食二十亿斤的巨大成绩，就是由于扩大冬种和改变耕作制度，这两项共增产近十亿斤的粮食。今年没有完成增产计划，除了自然灾害、改种经济作物和自留地过多等原因之外，就是由于比去年缩小了近五百万亩的冬种面积和改翻耕没有积极进行，有些地区还把已经改的放弃了。
    大会发言中还较多地提到，改造落后田和全面地实行新的农业技术改革对于增产的作用。广东省目前产量在四百斤以下的低产田，大约不下一千万亩，如果在两三年内抓紧改良土壤、增施肥料和改善栽培方法，到1967年能平均提高到每亩六百斤，只这一项就可以增产二十五亿斤。全省大约还有三千万亩田可以在技术改革方面做文章。这些田如果能全部实行潮汕的先进经验，深耕细作，做到以小株密植为中心的全套栽培新技术，那末在五年内每亩平均产量增加一百五十斤是完全可能的，这样就又可以增产四十五亿斤。把以上各项全部加起来，到1962年，全省四千八百万亩粮食作物耕地平均亩产量超过七百斤，争取达到八百斤，是有把握的。现在问题是在于事在人为，要坚决地实现上述措施。
    会议决定立即组织一个准备春耕生产的突击运动，以战斗的姿态在春耕前的两个月内搞好一切春耕生产的准备工作，以便在明年取得一个比1956年更大的丰收，为第二个五年计划开一个很好的头。会议要求各级党委集中一切可能的人力、财力、物力来搞好农业生产，党委书记特别是第一书记必须钻到生产中去，变成专家，要有理想，有办法，不叫苦，不空谈，要做确实能够移山的愚公。各级领导干部都要有自己的示范田。现在全省已经有好几个千斤县，至于千斤乡，千斤社为数更多。惠阳今年已创造出亩产近二千五百斤的高产田，明年各地应争取有亩产三千斤的高产田出现。各地必须做到有各种农作物高产的示范队、社、乡，培养典型，抓住不放，不断提高，取得经验，以推动一般。这是非常重要的领导生产的方法，各级党委要认真做好。应该从下放的干部中抽调较强的下放到乡、社去，切实加强农业生产的领导，各部门的工作也都要服从农业生产任务的需要，配合农业生产去进行部门工作。驻广东的人民解放军部队已经决定在明年春忙期间，到合作社参加劳动，全年预计要出三百万个工。
