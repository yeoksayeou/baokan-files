　　It is necessary to publicize that housework is also glorious
    Editor: A large number of cadres have been sent to factories and rural areas. At the same time, it is also very necessary to mobilize a small number of female comrades who are not suitable for outside work to return home to do housework. However, there is great resistance in this regard. Some people think that engaging in housework is unpromising and backward. For example, the wife of a section chief in our office has five children. She used to work as a female worker in a factory and has been out of work for a long time. Last year, she insisted on participating in work. Later, the office introduced her to a factory as an ordinary worker with a monthly salary of 38 yuan. Her two older children were already in primary school (teenagers), and two children were sent to the office's nursery, with a total monthly fee of 38 yuan (excluding the 20 yuan subsidy per child from the public). The youngest child was sent to the factory's nursery. The wife lives in the factory, and the husband is now studying and lives at school. Only two children who go to school are left at home without anyone to take care of them. In this case, it is impossible to fulfill the parents' responsibility to educate their children. Therefore, everyone believes that she should resign and return home, but when she was mobilized to return home, she firmly opposed it.
    I suggest that during this period, in conjunction with the transfer of cadres, we should also focus on publicizing that housework is also glorious. We should criticize those who despise housework and explain the relationship between housework and the overall national construction by introducing typical figures, so that everyone can have a correct understanding of housework in the new society.

### 需要宣传家务劳动也是光荣的

　　需要宣传家务劳动也是光荣的
    编辑同志：下放干部中有很大一部分到工厂和农村去了，同时对少数不适合出来工作的女同志，动员回家从事家务劳动，也是很必要的。但这方面的阻力很大，有些人认为从事家务劳动没有出息，是落后的。例如我们机关有个科长的爱人，有五个小孩，过去曾在工厂做过女工，现已长期脱离工作了，去年就坚持要求参加工作。后来机关就把她介绍到某工厂当普通工人，每月工资三十八元，她两个大孩子已上小学（十几岁），二个小孩送机关托儿所，每月交费共三十八元（公家每个小孩补贴二十元不在内），最小的小孩送入工厂托儿所。女方在工厂住，男方现在学习，在学校住，家里只留下二个上学的孩子无人照管，在这种情况下，就无法尽到父母教育子女的责任。所以大家都认为她应退职回家，但当动员她回家时，她却坚决反对。
    我建议，在这时期结合干部下放，同时应该着重宣传家务劳动也是光荣的。对那些轻视家务劳动的想法应予批判，并通过对典型人物的介绍，说明家务劳动和整个国家建设的关系，使大家对新社会的家务劳动有正确的认识。
