Xinhua News Agency, December 12th. The Sino-Myanmar Friendship Association held a grand gathering at the Capital Theater on the evening of December 12th to welcome the Deputy Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, U Ba Swe, and Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein, as well as all members of the Burmese Friendship Delegation and the Burmese Friendship Economic Observation Group.

The venue was decorated with the national flags of China and Myanmar and a huge golden welcome banner. The platform was filled with flowers. At exactly 7 o'clock, the two Deputy Prime Ministers and their wives, along with other distinguished Burmese guests, ascended the platform accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and others. Amidst thunderous and enthusiastic applause from the audience, the distinguished guests accepted flowers presented by young women from the capital.

Among those attending tonight's welcoming rally were Vice Premier He Long, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation Shi Liang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Chinese Ambassador to Myanmar Yao Zhongming, and representatives from all walks of life in the capital, totaling more than 1,200 people.

After a welcoming speech by Zheng Zhenduo, President of the Sino-Myanmar Friendship Association, Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe and Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein were invited to speak at the meeting. In their speeches, they unanimously emphasized the need to further strengthen Burmese-Chinese friendship on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, with the people of both countries working side by side to defend world peace. Their speeches repeatedly drew prolonged and enthusiastic applause from the audience.

In his speech, Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe said that the friendship between Myanmar and China is by no means just the friendship between two ordinary friendly countries, but rather the friendship between two related countries. The people of Myanmar have regarded the Chinese people as their own brothers for thousands of years, and the people of the two countries have been relatives since ancient times. Now, Myanmar and China, having experienced a painful past and become new independent countries, have a friendly relationship that is more developed and consolidated than in the past.

He said that the people of Myanmar and China, who are striving to build their respective new countries, are urgently demanding peace and, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, are working side by side to defend world peace.

Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe also said that the friendship between Myanmar and China and the people of the two countries is based on mutual trust. Therefore, no matter what conspiracies and threats exist, they cannot undermine the friendship between Myanmar and China.

In his speech, Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein used many historical facts to illustrate that the interests of Myanmar and China have been closely related throughout history. Whenever the Chinese people were happy and prosperous, the people of Myanmar were also happy and prosperous; and when the Chinese people suffered oppression and encountered difficulties, the people of Myanmar also suffered oppression and encountered difficulties.

Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein said that a brand new era has now begun. China has become a united and strong country with a rapidly developing economy; Myanmar is now also an independent country, and Myanmar and China are no longer afraid of any imperialism. Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein hoped that the friendship between Myanmar and China could be further developed on the basis of the Five Principles.

Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein also emphasized that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have not only been supported by Asian and African countries, but also by the majority of countries in the world.

In his welcoming speech, President Zheng Zhenduo warmly praised the important contributions made by the two Deputy Prime Ministers in striving for the independence and autonomy of the Burmese people, strengthening the solidarity of Asian and African countries, safeguarding world peace, and promoting Sino-Myanmar friendship. He said, "In order to further consolidate and strengthen Sino-Myanmar friendship, we are willing to work together with our Burmese friends."

At the welcoming rally, President Zheng Zhenduo presented flags and gifts to the distinguished guests on behalf of the Sino-Myanmar Friendship Association.

After the welcoming rally, the guests watched the Peking Opera "The Carp Spirit." After the performance, the two Burmese Deputy Prime Ministers, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and others, went on stage to meet with the actors, and the distinguished guests also presented the actors with flower baskets and flowers.

　　中缅两国的友谊是亲戚国家的友谊
    中缅友协盛会欢迎缅甸两位副总理
    新华社12日讯　中缅友好协会12日晚在首都剧场举行盛大集会，欢迎缅甸联邦副总理吴巴瑞和副总理吴觉迎，以及缅甸友好代表团和缅甸友好经济考察团的全体人员。
    大会会场上悬挂着中缅两国国旗和巨幅的金字欢迎标语，主席台前布满鲜花，七时正，两位副总理和他们的夫人以及缅甸其他贵宾们由周恩来总理等陪同登上主席台。在全场雷鸣般的热烈掌声中，贵宾们接受了首都女青年献给他们的鲜花。
    出席今晚欢迎大会的有贺龙副总理、李济深副委员长、国防委员会副主席张治中，全国妇联副主席史良、外交部副部长章汉夫、中国驻缅甸大使姚仲明和首都各界代表人士等共一千二百多人。
    在中缅友好协会会长郑振铎致欢迎词后，吴巴瑞副总理和吴觉迎副总理应邀在会上讲话。他们在讲话中一致强调要在和平共处五项原则的基础上进一步加强缅中友谊，两国人民并肩保卫世界和平。他们的讲话不时引起会场经久不息的热烈掌声。
    吴巴瑞副总理在讲话中说，缅中两国的友谊决不是两个普通的友好国家的友谊，而是两个亲戚国家的友谊。缅甸人民上千年前就把中国人民看做是自己的同胞兄弟，两国人民自古以来就结成了亲戚。现在，经历了痛苦的过去而成为新的独立国家的缅中两国，它们之间的友好关系已比过去更加发展和巩固。
    他说，正在努力建设各自的新国家的缅中两国人民都迫切要求和平，并且根据和平共处的五项原则，正在并肩为保卫世界和平而努力。
    吴巴瑞副总理还说，缅中两国和两国人民的友谊是基于相互间的信任，因此，不论任何阴谋和威胁，都不能破坏缅中两国之间的友谊。
    吴觉迎副总理在讲话中用许多历史事实说明了缅中两国的利益在历史上是休戚相关的，每当中国人民幸福和繁荣的时候，缅甸人民也就幸福和繁荣；而当中国人民蒙受压迫和遭遇困难的时候，缅甸人民也就蒙受压迫和遭遇困难。
    吴觉迎副总理说，现在，一个崭新的时代开始了。中国已经成为一个团结的、经济正在日益发展的强大国家；缅甸现在也是一个独立的国家，缅中两国再也不怕任何帝国主义了。吴觉迎副总理希望缅中两国的友谊在五项原则的基础上能得到更进一步的发展。
    吴觉迎副总理还着重指出，和平共处的五项原则，不仅得到亚洲和非洲国家的拥护和支持，而且得到世界上大多数国家的拥护和支持。
    郑振铎会长在欢迎词中热情地赞扬了两位副总理在争取缅甸人民的独立自主、加强亚非各国团结、维护世界和平与促进中缅友好等方面所作出的重要贡献。他说：“为了更进一步巩固和加强中缅友好，我们愿意和缅甸朋友们共同努力。”
    在欢迎大会上，郑振铎会长代表中缅友好协会向贵宾们献旗、赠礼。
    欢迎大会结束后，宾主一起观看了京剧“追鱼”。在演出以后，两位缅甸副总理由周总理等陪同，登台同演员们会见，贵宾们还向演员们赠送了花篮和鲜花。
