Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 17th. The largest thermal power plant in China, the Liaoning Power Plant, officially broke ground on the 16th.

On the afternoon of the 16th, when Jiang Guogui, the director of the engineering office responsible for building the power plant, issued the order to commence construction, the motors of all the machinery on the construction site roared into life. Huge excavators swung their iron arms, and rows of earth-moving trucks and dump trucks shuttled back and forth.

On the morning of the 16th, a groundbreaking ceremony was held at the construction site. Representatives of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the director of the Shenyang Infrastructure Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, and the director of the Shenyang Electric Power Bureau all congratulated the commencement of construction of the Liaoning Power Plant at the meeting, and encouraged all employees to resolutely implement the construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economical throughout the entire construction process.

According to plan, this huge power plant will be fully completed and put into production in May 1961; the first generating unit will begin generating electricity in May 1960.

This power plant is being built to solve the problem of insufficient industrial power consumption in the Northeast power grid. During the First Five-Year Plan, more than ten power plants were newly built and expanded in Northeast China, and the power generation capacity increased significantly. However, the development speed of the electric power industry still lags behind the development of other industrial construction, and the power supply is still very tight. In view of this situation, the state has specifically included the construction of the Liaoning Power Plant as an additional project to the First Five-Year Plan. After this power plant is put into production, it will powerfully guarantee the industrial and agricultural development of Northeast China in the Second Five-Year Plan.

The German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia will supply a complete set of automated high-pressure and high-temperature equipment for this large-scale power plant. The entire design of the factory was carried out by Chinese designers under the guidance of experts from the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia. In order to build this power plant, the employees of the construction unit began preparing for construction in January of this year. Thanks to the hard work of all employees over the past year, all necessary preparations have now been completed.

    保证东北地区工农业发展的需要
    辽宁发电厂破土开工
    新华社沈阳17日电　我国最大的火力发电厂——辽宁发电厂，在16日正式破土开工。
    16日下午，当承建这座电厂的工程处主任姜国贵发布了开工的命令以后，工地上所有机械的马达声顿时轰鸣起来，一台台巨大的挖土机挥舞起铁臂，成列的运土汽车和翻斗车也穿梭似的奔驰起来。
    16日上午，工地上举行了开工典礼大会。中共辽宁省委代表、电力工业部沈阳基建局局长、沈阳电业局局长等，都在会上祝贺辽宁发电厂开工建设，并勉励全体职工在整个施工过程中坚决贯彻多、快、好、省的建设方针。
    按照计划，这座巨大的发电厂将在1961年5月全部建成投入生产；1960年5月第一台机组即将开始发电。
    这座发电厂是为了解决东北电力网工业用电不足问题而建设的。在第一个五年计划中，东北地区共新建和扩建了十多个发电厂，发电能力有了很大的增加。但是电力工业的发展速度仍然赶不上其他工业建设的发展，电力供应仍很紧张。根据这种情况，国家特地将辽宁发电厂的建设列为第一个五年计划的追加项目。这座电厂投入生产后，将有力地保证东北地区在第二个五年计划中的工农业发展。
    民主德国和捷克斯洛伐克将对这座规模宏大的发电厂供应全套的自动化的高压高温设备。工厂的全部设计是在民主德国和捷克斯洛伐克专家的指导下，由我国设计人员自行设计的。为了建设这座电厂，承建单位的职工从今年1月就开始进行施工准备工作。经过全体职工一年来的辛勤劳动，目前已经完成了一切必要的准备工作。
