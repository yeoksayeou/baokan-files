    Self-Registration, Public Discussion, Leadership Approval, Unified Arrangement
　　Shanghai's Various Agencies to Transfer 140,000 Cadres Downwards
    This newspaper reports from Shanghai on the 30th: Shanghai has preliminarily decided to transfer 140,000 cadres from the Party committees and government agencies at both the municipal and district levels, people's organizations, schools, and enterprises and institutions to the countryside and grassroots levels to participate in labor production or grassroots work.

    In recent days, a revolutionary upsurge of demanding to go to the countryside and to the grassroots to participate in labor has formed in many agencies in Shanghai. Among the cadres in each unit who requested to go to the countryside to work, there are leading cadres at all levels, including district party secretaries, bureau directors, ministers, division chiefs, office directors, and section chiefs.

    The young people in the various agencies appear the most active in this revolutionary upsurge, and they account for a large proportion of the number of people applying to go to the countryside. Two-thirds of the cadres of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, including responsible cadres such as Propaganda Minister Yuan Donglin and Deputy Minister Zhao Jiegang, have already submitted applications.

    The first batch of 3,000 to 4,000 cadres to be transferred downwards in Shanghai this time will be transferred in batches from some agencies and schools, using the method of self-registration, public discussion, leadership approval, and unified arrangement. On the 26th, Shanghai Fudan University approved and announced the list of the first batch of 118 teachers and staff members who requested to go to the countryside. It is estimated that the work of transferring 140,000 people will be completed around the end of February next year.

    自报公议　领导批准　统一安排
　　上海各机关将下放干部十四万
    本报上海30日电　上海市已初步决定从市区两级党委与政府机关、人民团体、学校以及企业与事业单位，抽调干部十四万人，下放到农村和基层，参加劳动生产或基层工作。
    这些天来，上海许多机关里已形成要求下乡和下基层参加劳动的革命浪潮。各单位要求下乡劳动的干部中，包括有区委书记、局长、部长、处长、办公室主任、科长等各级领导干部。
    各机关的青年们在这个革命浪潮中显得最积极和活跃，他们在申请下乡的人数中占着很大的比例。共青团上海市委机关已经有三分之二的干部，包括宣传部长袁东林，副部长赵介纲等负责干部在内提出了申请。
    上海市这次下放的干部第一批三、四千人，将在部分机关学校内采取自报公议、领导批准、统一安排的办法，分批下放。上海复旦大学在26日已批准公布了第一批要求下乡的一百一十八个教师员工的名单。十四万人的下放工作预计在明年2月底左右完成。
