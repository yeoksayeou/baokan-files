    Becoming a New Commune Member
    Xie Zhiyi
    No longer preparing for work early in the morning,
    Just hoping the team leader invites me to the fields.
    The calluses on my hands are now thick,
    Swinging a hoe instead of wielding a pen.
    When I first came, I couldn't help but complain of leg pain and backache,
    Now carrying water is a breeze.
    Participating in labor production is so blissful,
    The new commune member wholeheartedly wants to become an old commune member.

    当上了新社员
    谢之一
    早起不再准备去上班
    只盼队长邀我去下田
    掌上的茧已经磨得厚厚
    抡起镢头代替舞笔杆
    乍来时说不出腿痛腰酸
    现在担水走路一溜烟
    参加劳动生产多幸福
    新社员一心想当老社员
                  （山东莒南）
