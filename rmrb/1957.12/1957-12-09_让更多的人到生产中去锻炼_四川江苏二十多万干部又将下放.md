　　Let More People Go to Production to Temper Themselves
　　Sichuan and Jiangsu to Send Another 200,000+ Cadres Down to the Countryside

　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 8th: (Shao Tingjun reporting) Sichuan Province will send down 200,000 to 250,000 cadres.

　　Before June of next year, Sichuan Province will send another 120,000 to 170,000 cadres down to the countryside, mainly to the agricultural labor front. Combined with the 80,000+ cadres already sent down since the beginning of this year, the total number of cadres sent down from local and centrally-stationed units in the province will reach 200,000 to 250,000.

　　This plan was decided at the enlarged meeting of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee held from the end of November to the beginning of December. Based on the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the meeting carefully examined and studied the situation of the rectification movement in the province. The meeting believed that although the province has done a lot of work in streamlining institutions and sending cadres down to the countryside since the beginning of this year, it is still far from enough. According to the materials reflected by all parties since the rectification movement, there are still too many people detached from production in the organs at all levels above the county level and the management and service personnel of enterprises and institutions, and they can be greatly reduced. Before this meeting, the opinions put forward by some provincial-level organs and regions also illustrated this situation. For example, the departments of industry, transportation, and agriculture proposed that the cadres that can be sent down account for 30% to 40%+ of the existing staffing. Cities and special districts such as Chongqing, Chengdu, and Luzhou also proposed that the number of cadres sent down accounts for more than 30% of the existing staffing. Therefore, the meeting required that 30% of the cadres of organs at all levels in the province should be sent down, and the administrative management personnel sent down by enterprises and institutions at all levels should account for 31.2% to 34.3% of the personnel detached from production. In order to strengthen the construction of mountainous areas, the meeting also required that the cadres sent down from Chengdu and Zigong should go to Ya'an and Xichang special districts as much as possible; the cadres sent down from Chongqing should go to Dazhou, Fuling and Wanxian three special districts.

　　The meeting also studied in detail the problems existing in the work of sending cadres down to the countryside. It required that all localities must vigorously do political and ideological work and organizational work, and fully explain the great significance of participating in production to the cadres. Leading cadres at all levels should personally take action to understand the ideological situation of all personnel (including family members) on participating in physical labor and the actual difficulties of the personnel sent down to the countryside in various ways, and earnestly study and help solve them.

　　Since the beginning of this year, Sichuan Province has sent down more than 80,000 cadres, most of whom have directly participated in labor production. These cadres have played an active and backbone role in improving the operation and management of agricultural cooperatives and developing production.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 8th: Jiangsu Province has sent down more than 78,000 cadres to production posts and grassroots work posts. Among them, there are more than 30 department- and bureau-level cadres and more than 270 division-level cadres who have been sent down to the grassroots. This was said by Hui Yuyu, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in his report "On the Issue of Sending Cadres Down to the Countryside" at the Second Session of the Third Congress of the Chinese Communist Party of Jiangsu Province held on the 5th.

　　After summarizing the work achievements of sending cadres down to the countryside, Hui Yuyu pointed out that the work of sending cadres down to the countryside by party and government organs, institutions, and enterprise departments above the county level had progressed slowly not long ago, and there were not many who were directly sent down to production posts.

　　In his report, Hui Yuyu put forward specific tasks and requirements for the work of sending cadres down to the countryside in Jiangsu Province in the future. The Provincial Party Committee has initially determined that 130,000 cadres will be sent down throughout the province, and it is estimated that this number may be exceeded, requiring that it be basically completed before the end of February next year. The streamlining targets for each region and system are roughly: a 30% reduction in administrative staffing, including a 35% to 50% reduction in provincial-level organs, a 40% reduction in regional and special organs, a 35% to 50% reduction in each city, and a 15% to 20% reduction in county-level staffing; a 50% reduction in enterprise and institutional staffing.

### 让更多的人到生产中去锻炼　四川江苏二十多万干部又将下放

    让更多的人到生产中去锻炼
　　四川江苏二十多万干部又将下放
    本报特约新华社成都8日电邵挺军报道：四川省下放干部将达二十万到二十五万人。
    四川省到明年6月以前将再下放干部十二万人到十七万人，其中主要是下乡、上山到农业劳动战线上去。再加上今年初以来已经下放的八万多人，全省地方和中央驻省单位下放的干部将共达二十万到二十五万人。
    这个计划是11月底到12月初举行的中共四川省委扩大会议决定的。这次会议根据中共八届三中全会的精神，认真地检查和研究了全省整风运动的情况。会议认为今年以来全省虽在紧缩机构和下放干部方面作了不少工作，但还很不够。从整风以来各方面反映的材料看，目前全省县以上各级机关脱离生产人员、企业事业单位的管理人员和服务人员仍然过多，还可以大大减少。这次会议前，一些省级机关和地区提出的意见，也都说明了这一情况。例如工业、交通、农业等厅提出，可以下放的干部占现有编制人员的30％到40％多。重庆、成都、泸州等市和专区，提出下放干部的人数也都占现有编制人员的30％以上。因此，会议要求全省各级机关干部应下放30％，各级企业和事业单位下放的行政管理人员，应占脱产人员的31.2％到34.3％。为了加强山区建设，会议还要求成都、自贡两市下放的干部，应尽量到雅安、西昌两专区；重庆市下放的干部，应到达县、涪陵和万县三个专区。
    会议还详细地研究了下放干部工作中存在的问题。要求各地必须大力做好政治思想工作和组织工作，充分向干部说明参加生产的重大意义。各级领导干部应亲自动手，采取各种方式了解全体人员（包括家属）对参加体力劳动的思想情况，和下放人员的实际困难，并认真研究帮助解决。
    今年年初以来，四川省已下放了八万多干部，他们大部都直接参加了劳动生产。这批干部在农业社里对改进社的经营管理、发展生产起了积极和骨干作用。
    新华社南京8日电　江苏省已有七万八千多名干部下放到生产岗位和基层工作岗位。其中下放到基层的部、厅长级干部有三十多名，处长级干部有二百七十多名。这是中共江苏省委书记惠浴宇代表省委在5日举行的中共江苏省第三届代表大会第二次会议上作的“关于下放干部问题”的报告中说的。
    惠浴宇在总结了下放干部的工作成绩后指出，不久前县以上党政机关、事业和企业部门下放干部的工作进展迟缓，直接下放到生产岗位的还不多。
    惠浴宇在报告中对今后江苏省下放干部的工作提出了具体任务和要求。省委初步确定全省下放干部十三万名，估计可能超过这个数字，要求在明年2月底以前基本完成。各地区、各系统的紧缩指标大体是：行政编制减30％，其中省级机关减35％到50％，地专机关减40％，各市减35％到50％，县级减15％到20％；企业事业编制减50％。
