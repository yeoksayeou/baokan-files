At the Eighth National Congress of Trade Unions of China
Speech by Nikola Tsaichev, Secretary of the Central Council of Trade Unions of Bulgaria

Dear Comrades,

I am very pleased to have the opportunity, on behalf of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and all Bulgarian workers, to extend our heartfelt congratulations to your Eighth National Congress and the great fraternal Chinese workers.

We believe that your sincere invitation demonstrates respect for our small country and the Bulgarian trade unions. We believe that this invitation expresses the desire to further consolidate the militant unity of the international working class and peace among the peoples of all countries.

The Central Council of Trade Unions of Bulgaria is pleased to note that the respect and concern of the Bulgarian working class for your beautiful country and people is growing. Your achievements not only make us happy and proud, but also make us more confident that our common cause of building socialism and defending our achievements from imperialist aggression is beyond doubt.

We are firmly convinced that we, together with you, are united in the indestructible socialist camp headed by the powerful Soviet Union, the liberator and selfless defender of our people.

Comrade Delegates, the victorious completion and overfulfillment this year of your first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, as well as the cooperativization of agriculture and handicrafts, demonstrate that you have acquired a solid foundation for a more rapid development of the socialist economy. Of course, all this is primarily due to the tremendous socialist labor enthusiasm displayed by the heroic and modest Chinese working class, under the leadership of the glorious and wise Chinese Communist Party headed by our beloved comrade and leader, Chairman Mao Zedong.

We firmly believe that in the next five-year plan, the great Chinese working class will surely achieve new and greater achievements in socialist economic and cultural construction, thereby further improving its own living conditions.

We have learned from the experience of the Soviet Union and our own that it is difficult to lay the foundations of socialism in countries like ours, which have suffered economic backwardness due to the betrayal of bourgeois governments and the evils of imperialist countries.

For the Bulgarian workers, under the leadership of the Communist Party, after being liberated from fascist rule and the brutal exploitation of capitalism, it is important to accelerate the increase of labor productivity, reduce product costs and practice strict economy. This is not easy. We are now overcoming the difficulties. However, there is no other more practical and effective way to improve life. The Bulgarian workers understand this.

Advancing along the correct path of socialist development, and with the help of the Soviet big brother and other socialist countries, our industrial output has increased about six times; heavy industry output has increased thirteen times; machine manufacturing output has increased twenty-eight times; electricity production has increased more than eight times; and daily necessities output has increased more than three times. Agriculture has also been basically cooperativized.

Illiteracy among adults has been eliminated. One in six of us is studying, and one in every two hundred and thirty-one is studying in higher education institutions.

The state is very concerned about the health of the working people and implements free medical care.

In 1956, nearly 20% of the workers rested in trade union sanatoriums and recuperation homes, paying only one-third of the total cost of the recuperation tickets. This year, the situation has improved even more.

In November of this year, the People's Assembly, based on the suggestions of the trade unions, passed a new social security law. This law increased the amount of social security benefits, while lowering the required length of service for workers in certain types of work to receive social security benefits. The People's Assembly also made certain revisions and supplements to the labor legislation, thereby further improving the living conditions of the workers.

Our working people express their gratitude for all this, gratitude to our people's government, trade unions, and especially the Bulgarian Communist Party.

We are now widely mobilizing the enthusiasm for socialist construction in order to increase our national wealth faster, thereby further improving our material and cultural life.

Dear Comrades, please allow me once again to thank you for inviting us to participate in your congress. From your congress, we will certainly be able to learn a lot of experience. At the same time, I sincerely extend my fraternal congratulations to you and assure you that we will always be faithful to the cause of socialism, peace, and the solidarity of the international working class.

Long live the Chinese working class and the Chinese trade unions!

Long live the great People's Republic of China!

Long live the militant unity and unification of the working class of the world!

Long live world peace!

    在中国工会第八次全国代表大会上
    保加利亚工会中央理事会书记尼古拉·蔡契夫致词亲爱的同志们：
    我感到非常高兴，能够有机会代表保加利亚人民共和国工会中央理事会和保加利亚全体职工，向你们第八次全国代表大会和伟大的兄弟般的中国职工同志们致以衷心的祝贺。
    我们认为，你们的诚挚的邀请，表现了对我们这样一个小国和保加利亚工会的尊重。我们认为，这个邀请表达了这样的愿望，即进一步巩固国际工人阶级战斗的团结和各国人民之间的和平。
    保加利亚工会中央理事会高兴地指出：保加利亚工人阶级对你们美好的国家和人民的尊重及关心正在日益增长。你们的成就不仅使我们感到高兴和骄傲，而且使我们更加相信，我们建设社会主义和保卫我们的成果不受帝国主义侵犯的共同事业，是不容置疑的。
    我们深信不疑：我们和你们一起团结在以我国人民的解放者和无私的保卫者——强大的苏联为首的牢不可破的社会主义阵营之中。
    代表同志们：今年你们发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的胜利完成和超额完成，以及农业和手工业的合作化，表明了你们已经具备了更加迅速发展社会主义经济的稳固基础。当然，所有这一切，首先是由于英勇的、谦逊的中国工人阶级，在以亲爱的同志和领袖毛泽东主席为首的光荣和英明的中国共产党领导下，发挥了巨大的社会主义劳动积极性的结果。
    我们坚决相信，在下一个五年计划中，伟大的中国工人阶级在社会主义经济和文化建设方面，一定会取得新的更大的成就，从而进一步改善自己的生活状况。
    我们从苏联和自己的经验中了解到，在我们这样一些由于资产阶级政府的叛卖和帝国主义国家的罪恶而造成经济落后的国家中，要建立社会主义的基础，会遇到许多困难。
    对于在共产党领导下的保加利亚工人来说，从法西斯统治和资本主义残酷剥削下获得解放以后，重要的是加速提高劳动生产率、降低产品成本和厉行节约。这是不容易的。我们现在正在克服着困难。但是，没有其他更切实有效的改善生活的道路。保加利亚的职工是懂得这一点的。
    沿着社会主义发展的正确道路前进，并且在苏联老大哥和其他社会主义国家的帮助下，我国工业产量增加了约六倍；重工业的产量增加了十三倍；机器制造业的产量增加了二十八倍；电力生产增加了八倍多；日用品产量增加了三倍多。农业也已经基本上合作化了。
    成年人中的文盲已经消灭。我们每六个人中就有一个人在学习，每二百三十一人中就有一人在高等学校学习。
    国家非常关怀劳动人民的健康，实行了免费医疗。
    1956年有将近20％的职工在工会休养所和疗养院里休养，他们仅缴付休养券全部费用的三分之一。今年这方面的情况更加改善了。
    今年11月间，人民议会根据工会的建议通过了新的保证金法。这个法令增加了保证金的数额，同时对某些工种的工人领取保证金的必要工龄的要求降低了。人民议会还对劳动立法作了某些修改和补充，从而使职工的生活状况更加改善了。
    我国劳动人民对所有这一切表示非常感谢，感谢我们的人民政权、工会，特别是保加利亚共产党。
    现在我们正在广泛地调动社会主义建设的积极性，以便更快地增加我国的财富，从而进一步改善我们的物质和文化生活状况。
    亲爱的同志们：请允许我再一次地感谢你们邀请我们参加你们的代表大会。从你们的代表大会中，我们一定能够学习到许多经验。同时，我衷心地向你们致以兄弟般的祝贺，并且向你们保证，我们将永远忠实于社会主义、和平和国际工人阶级团结的事业。
    中国工人阶级和中国工会万岁！
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    全世界工人阶级的战斗团结和统一万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
