New Victory for the Principle of Self-determination
By a commentator of this newspaper

    The recent passage of the proposal regarding the Cyprus issue by the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly is another new proof of the rising anti-colonialist forces.
    This proposal affirms that the people of Cyprus should enjoy the right to self-determination, and hopes that "further negotiations and discussions" will be carried out in line with this aim. This points out the correct principle that should be followed in resolving the Cyprus issue, which is an important improvement compared to the vague reference to seeking a "peaceful, democratic, and just solution" by the previous General Assembly.
    The reason why the Cyprus issue has not been resolved for a long time is that the British imperialists, for their own colonial interests, have stubbornly refused to recognize the right to self-determination of the Cypriot people. In the ten months after the last UN General Assembly passed a resolution on the Cyprus issue, although Britain released Archbishop Makarios and proposed various deceptive "autonomy" plans, fundamentally, it still insisted on maintaining its colonial rule over Cyprus, and denied the national aspiration of the Cypriot people to demand self-determination.
    At this session of the United Nations General Assembly, Britain carried out a number of activities, trying to get the Political Committee to pass only a vague proposal again, avoiding talking about the principle of national self-determination. However, despite the opposition of the colonial countries, the proposal finally passed by the Political Committee pointed out that "the right of self-determination applies to the people of Cyprus." This is a victory for the anti-colonial forces. It has morally bankrupted Britain's colonial policy towards Cyprus in the face of world opinion.
    During the discussion in the Political Committee, US representative Lodge tried his best to help Britain, and argued that the Cyprus issue did not need to be resolved by the United Nations, and demanded "quiet diplomacy" by the parties concerned, wanting to avoid the United Nations General Assembly from carrying out the tasks stipulated by the Charter on the Cyprus issue. People know that the United States has recently been actively planning to place Cyprus under the control of the North Atlantic Group, turning it from a British colonial area into a base for the United States to carry out colonial expansion in the Middle East. For this purpose, the United States has played many tricks, pretending to be an impartial "mediator." The discussion in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly and the fact that the United States abstained from the vote clearly show the people of Cyprus that the schemers in Washington are by no means their friends either.

　　自决原则的新胜利
　　本报评论员
    最近联合国大会政治委员会通过了关于塞浦路斯问题的提案，是反殖民主义力量日益高涨的又一个新的证明。
    这个提案肯定塞浦路斯人民应当享有自决权，并且希望本着这个宗旨来“进一步进行谈判和讨论”。这就为解决塞浦路斯问题指出了应当遵循的正确原则，比起上届大会笼统地提到寻求一个“和平、民主和公正的解决办法”来，是一项重要的进步。
    塞浦路斯问题之所以长期不能得到解决，原因就是英国帝国主义者为了自己的殖民利益，一直顽固地拒绝承认塞浦路斯人民的自决权利。在上届联合国大会通过关于塞浦路斯问题的决议之后，时间过了十个月，英国虽然释放了马卡里奥斯大主教，并且提出这样那样欺骗性的“自治”方案；但是，万变不离其宗，它仍然坚持保持对塞浦路斯的殖民统治，而否认塞浦路斯人民要求自决的民族愿望。
    在这届联合国大会上，英国曾经进行了不少活动，想使政治委员会仍旧只通过一个含糊其辞的提案，对民族自决原则避开不谈。但是，不顾殖民国家的反对，政治委员会最后通过的提案指出“自决权适用于塞浦路斯人民”。这是反殖民主义力量的一个胜利。它使得英国对塞浦路斯的殖民主义政策在世界舆论前面遭到了道义上的破产。
    美国代表洛奇在政治委员会讨论中曾经竭力为英国帮腔，并且主张塞浦路斯问题不必由联合国来解决，要求有关方面进行“静悄悄的外交”，想这样来避免联合国大会对塞浦路斯问题执行宪章规定的任务。人们知道，美国最近积极策划把塞浦路斯置于北大西洋集团的控制下，使它从英国的殖民统治地区变为美国在中东进行殖民扩张的一个据点。为了这个目的，美国玩弄了不少手法，装作公正的“调解人”的样子。联合国大会政治委员会上的讨论和美国在表决时弃权的事实，清楚地向塞浦路斯人民表明，华盛顿的阴谋家也决不是他们的朋友。
