The Experience of Daqu Township in Running a Farmer's Spare-time Middle School
中共山西安邑县委会 (CCP Shanxi Anyi County Committee)

How It Was Established

Daqu Township is a township in Anyi County, Shanxi Province, with a relatively good working foundation. As early as 1953, some villages in this township established elementary agricultural cooperatives. By 1956, the entire township had merged to establish an advanced agricultural cooperative - the Friendship Cooperative. Because the agricultural cooperative was relatively well managed, the first year of advanced collectivization showed the superiority of collective management. The living standards of the cooperative members were significantly improved. Last year, 95% of the cooperative members increased their income, and 82% of the cooperative members improved to the living standards of middle peasants.

With the improvement of the living standards of the cooperative members, their cultural life and cultural level also improved relatively quickly. At present, the entire cooperative has 259 knowledge youth in the township, accounting for 39% of the total number of youth in the cooperative. The vast majority of these young people are graduates of elementary and middle schools in the past two or three years. After returning to their hometowns, most of them participated in production, and at the same time, their desire for learning and further education was very strong. Before last year, although many people insisted on self-study and some villages established self-study groups, the results were not significant due to the lack of organization and leadership. Because the desire to learn could not be satisfied, most of the senior elementary school graduates were not content to participate in production in the township after last summer vacation. Some cried because they failed the school entrance exams; some went out to find work several times; some often quarreled with their parents; some were loafing around and not working properly... Many people directly asked the Party and Communist Youth League branches: "You should find ways to organize us to study, don't let us waste our time at home." The principal of the local elementary school also suggested to the township to establish a spare-time middle school.

Based on these situations, in the autumn of last year, the Party, government, Communist Youth League organizations, and agricultural cooperative of Daqu Township decided that the agricultural cooperative would run a spare-time junior middle school (hereinafter referred to as "spare-time middle school"). Before the school was established, the conditions for establishing the school were analyzed, a school establishment plan was formulated, teachers were hired, a school office was established, and the study courses, study time, and study address were determined. After enrollment and examinations, 84 students were admitted.

In the early days of the school, the students' enthusiasm for learning was very high. Every time a class was held, more than 90% of the students attended. However, due to the excessively broad standards for admitting students, the students' cultural levels were inconsistent, and because the students' family economic conditions were not analyzed when they were admitted, only half of the students in the school could regularly persist in learning. Faced with this situation, the school office made timely adjustments. Students with excessively low levels and families lacking labor were allowed to drop out, and the remaining 47 students who could persist in learning were reorganized into classes and groups. In this way, the spare-time middle school persisted according to plan.

What Kind of People to Cultivate?

What kind of people should the spare-time middle school cultivate? This was a question that Daqu Township had been grappling with throughout the process of establishing the spare-time middle school.

In the early days of the school, it was vaguely proposed that the purpose of running the spare-time middle school was to organize senior elementary school graduates to study and cultivate successors for the agricultural cooperative. However, the hopes and requirements of all parties for running the spare-time middle school were diverse. From the perspective of the agricultural cooperative, it was required that the spare-time middle school cultivate technical talents and active participants in cultural and recreational activities, and educate students to work hard. From the perspective of parents, those with better economic conditions hoped that their children would attend the spare-time middle school to make up for their lessons in preparation for further education; those with poorer economic conditions let their children attend the spare-time middle school in order to preserve their original knowledge and learn some production skills. Among the students, the majority wanted to continue their education through tutoring in the spare-time middle school; about half wanted to study to make it easier to find a job or become township or cooperative cadres in the future; only a few were for the purpose of working better. However, the school did not seriously analyze and study these situations, and was not clear enough about the direction, tasks, and principles that should be grasped in running the spare-time middle school. Therefore, in the spring of this year, when the students saw the news in the newspaper that most of this year's middle and elementary school graduates could not be promoted to higher grades and that cadres were being sent down to the countryside, ideological confusion immediately occurred, and their enthusiasm for learning suddenly declined. Some township and cooperative cadres also doubted the role of running the spare-time middle school, saying, "Middle school students are going back to production, so what's the point of us running a spare-time middle school?" As a result, the leadership of the spare-time middle school was relaxed. Later, because most of the students still wanted to run it, and the county committee also instructed that it must be run well, it continued to persist.

After this twist, the higher authorities gave instructions again, and the township, cooperative, and school office all began to study the question of "What kind of school should the spare-time middle school be?" After more than half a year of exploration, it was initially clarified that the farmer's spare-time middle school is a form of organizing knowledge youth in the township to carry out spare-time cultural learning. It is different from ordinary middle schools, as well as farmer's spare-time technical schools and various training classes. It should be closely integrated with production, and through spare-time classroom teaching and self-study, in four or five years, raise the cultural level of existing young people who are equivalent to senior elementary school graduates to a level roughly equivalent to junior middle school graduates in several major subjects such as Chinese and mathematics, and learn common agricultural science and technology knowledge as much as possible according to the local production needs, so as to cultivate them into new-style farmers with culture and play a greater pioneering role in building a new socialist countryside.

With the direction and tasks clarified, specific problems were also easier to solve. For example, teaching content, teaching time, teaching methods, etc., all had principles to follow. These principles are: spare-time, voluntary, thrifty, and serving production.

Teaching Content and Teaching Time

In the early days of the school, because the direction and tasks were not clear, the study courses were arranged according to the main courses of ordinary middle schools. In the summer of this year, in order to combine with production, the courses were set as three subjects: literature, arithmetic, and botany, combined with learning some agricultural technical knowledge. From the perspective of teaching effectiveness and student requirements, these courses were basically appropriate.

Now, with the development of the spare-time middle school, the study courses for three to four years have also been preliminarily determined, namely: the first year is four subjects: Chinese, arithmetic (including abacus), biology, and agricultural technology; the second year is four subjects: Chinese, algebra, biology, and agricultural technology; the third year is three subjects: Chinese, physics and chemistry, and agricultural technology. Political classes are held in all grades, and the school affairs committee, Party, and Communist Youth League responsible cadres give lectures on policies and current affairs in conjunction with the central work from time to time.

The study time basically grasped the principle of spare-time learning. Because the students of the spare-time middle school are distributed in villages far and near, it is impossible to carry out classroom learning entirely during non-production time. Therefore, according to the principle of "study more when not busy, study less when slightly busy, and take a break from school when very busy," they once occupied part of the production time for classroom learning. In the winter of last year, there was a class every three days, each time for six hours. In the spring, it was shortened to four hours in the morning. In the summer, it was shortened to three and a half hours. During the Spring Festival, spring plowing and sowing, and wheat harvesting, there were vacations of 20 days, 15 days, and 30 days respectively.

With this arrangement, students who live relatively close to the school can still participate in half a day of labor in the village after each class. Students who live relatively far from the school often have to waste a whole day. In order to solve this problem, the agricultural cooperative stipulated that spare-time middle school students can participate in labor in the 50 mu of experimental fields near the school. In this way, students who live relatively far from the school can also work for half a day every time they have class.

Conducting classroom learning during production time has a certain impact on students' participation in production, but as long as the students are mobilized to seize the time to work actively, they can basically achieve both production and learning without delay. The four spare-time middle school students (three males and one female) in Wangjiaying Village completed a total of 902.8 work points in six months this year. Compared with the four senior elementary school graduates of the same labor force who did not attend the spare-time middle school, each person averaged only twelve fewer working days.

How to Teach and Learn

According to the needs of the courses, the spare-time middle school hired a total of three teachers. These three teachers have a high cultural level (university graduates), and their lectures are also relatively patient, and they are basically competent for the teaching tasks. The school especially emphasized the preparation work for teachers: before each class, the three teachers spend more than an hour studying and preparing the content of the text, teaching methods, and difficult problems that students may raise. In terms of teaching methods, a five-ring teaching method is generally adopted.

Since the spare-time middle school is cultivating new-style farmers with culture, it is necessary to emphasize the teaching principle of applying what is learned, so it is necessary to pay special attention to explaining the principles clearly, connecting with reality, and guiding practical application when giving lectures. For example, when teaching Chinese, in addition to teaching textbooks, special attention should be paid to training students to write; when teaching mathematics, students should be guided to learn how to apply certain principles of arithmetic in production. Therefore, students actually applied the calculation methods of "area," "volume," and "percentage" when measuring land area, calculating work points for canal repair, and usually calculating production ratio figures. When teaching plants, the plant teacher made even better use of the favorable conditions in the countryside to carry out object teaching and field teaching.

In addition, since the classroom teaching time in the spare-time middle school is short, it is necessary to guide students in spare-time self-study. Since the establishment of the school, self-study groups have been established by village. Through self-study groups, old lessons are reviewed, homework is worked out, and students with poor grades are helped to learn.

Teacher Remuneration and School Funding Issues

The issue of teacher remuneration in the township's spare-time middle school is resolved based on the principles of "who goes to school, who pays," "how much is missed, how much is compensated," and "teachers and students do not suffer losses." Since the establishment of the school, the three teachers have received a total of 1,020 work points, with each student bearing an average of 46 points. The work points earned by the teachers and the work points paid by the students are allocated quarterly by the school office, the cooperative's welfare section, and the finance section.

School funding expenditures are resolved by the agricultural cooperative's public welfare fund and the income from students' voluntary labor. Since the school was established, in the spirit of running the school thriftily, a total of 80 yuan has been spent to purchase desks, textbooks, reference books and newspapers, chalk, and paper. The average monthly teaching cost is about three yuan.

Leadership Issues

The spare-time middle school is run by the agricultural cooperative, and the school office is composed of responsible cadres and teachers from the Party, government, Communist Youth League, and cooperative departments. The principal is the Party branch propaganda committee member and the agricultural cooperative's political deputy director, and the dean of teaching affairs is the township cultural and educational director and the Communist Youth League branch propaganda committee member. It is stipulated that a school affairs meeting is held once a month to study the overall work of the school; a teaching affairs meeting is held every half month to study the teaching work. The daily work of the school is the responsibility of the dean of teaching affairs.

The township's Party and Communist Youth League organizations pay special attention to the ideological education of teachers and students. In the early days of the school, the school equipment was relatively simple, there were no desks or chairs, and the classrooms were not fixed, which made many students greatly dissatisfied and shaken their confidence in learning. At this time, the Party and Communist Youth League branches cooperated with the school office to explain to the students the facts of a school in Kunming running the school arduously and the stories of the Red Army's Long March and the heroic struggle of the female hero Liu Hulan, and carried out the education of hard learning and running the school thriftily for the students. In the spring of this year, many students' thoughts were confused because they could not go on to higher education. In response to the students' thoughts, the Party branch systematically explained to the students the People's Daily editorial and the county committee's propaganda outline on labor education, explained the principles and tasks of primary and secondary school education, the relationship between learning and labor, etc., and criticized some wrong ideas, stabilizing the students' emotions. In peacetime, the Party branch also regularly gave political classes to students, conducting current affairs and policy education.

The students in the spare-time middle school are all knowledge youth, so it is also important to strengthen the work of the Communist Youth League. In addition to assigning the propaganda committee member to participate in the leadership of the school office, the Communist Youth League Daqu Township General Branch also established a temporary Communist Youth League group in the spare-time middle school to actively assist the Party branch in carrying out ideological education for students, assist teachers in improving teaching work, and guide students in spare-time self-study. Of the nine self-study groups in the school, the group leaders of seven groups are Communist Youth League members.

Preliminary Harvest

Since its establishment, the spare-time middle school in Daqu Township has achieved remarkable results.

First of all, through classroom teaching and spare-time self-study, not only has the original cultural knowledge been consolidated, but also the Chinese, arithmetic, botany and other courses of the first semester of the first grade of junior middle school have been systematically studied, and the students' Chinese, arithmetic level and agricultural production technical knowledge have been significantly improved.

Secondly, the students of the spare-time middle school have become a shock force to promote the production and work of townships and cooperatives. The "Spare-time Middle School Youth Shock Team" is a mobile force of the agricultural cooperative. Whenever there are urgent production tasks, the cooperative sends them to various production teams to support them. During the wheat harvest this year, the Spare-time Middle School Shock Team helped the Xifeng Village Production Team to harvest 105 mu of wheat. They are also a fresh force in propaganda work, literacy work, and various central tasks. A total of 24 students in the school have served as technicians, team secretaries, volunteer teachers, literacy tutors, news readers, and bulletin board members.

Even more significant is that through the study and labor education in the spare-time middle school, the thoughts of the vast majority of students have changed. They have seen the socialist future of the countryside from the new atmosphere of their own township and cooperative. Those who used to say "there is no future in the countryside" and went out to find work several times now say "I can work and study in the countryside, and I won't leave even if you drive me away." Those who used to call labor bitter now see the fruits of their labor and have feelings for labor, and have initially developed labor habits. According to statistics, 47 students in the spare-time middle school have worked a total of more than 3,500 workdays in six months this year. Wang Bingqian, Zhao Yunping, Li Yingcao and other 14 people were also awarded the title of labor model by the cooperative and the team this year. Therefore, many cooperative members praised the students of the spare-time middle school as "good cooperative members who are capable of both literary and martial arts."

　　大渠乡办农民业余中学的经验
    中共山西安邑县委会
    怎样成立起来的
    大渠乡是山西省安邑县工作基础较好的一个乡。早在1953年，这个乡的部分村就建立了初级农业社，到1956年，全乡合并建立了一个高级农业社——友谊社。由于农业社经营比较好，高级合作化第一年就显示了集体经营的优越性。社员的生活水平有了显著的提高。去年，全社有95％的社员增加了收入，有82％的社员提高到了中农的生活水平。
    随着社员生活水平的提高，社员的文化生活和文化水平也提高得比较快。目前，全社共有在乡知识青年二百五十九人，占到全社青年总数的39％。这些青年绝大多数是近二、三年的完小和中学的毕业生。他们回乡以后，大都参加了生产，同时对学习要求和升学要求十分强烈。去年以前，虽然有不少人坚持自学，有些村建立了自学小组，但是因为缺乏组织领导，收效不大。由于学习要求不能满足，在去年暑假以后，大部分高小毕业生不安心在乡生产。有的因为考不上学校痛哭流涕；有的几次外出找工作；有的时常同家长吵架；有的吊儿郎当不好好劳动……不少人直接向党、团支部要求：“你们应当想法组织我们学习，不要让我们在家荒废了。”本乡完小校长也向乡里提出建立业余中学的建议。
    根据这些情况，去年秋季，大渠乡的党、政、团组织和农业社确定：由农业社举办一所业余初级中学（以下简称业中）。在建校以前，分析了建校条件，制定了建校计划，选聘了教师，建立了校部，确定了学习课程、学习时间和学习地址，经过招生、考试，吸收了八十四名学生。
    建校初期，学生的学习情绪十分高涨，每次上课，到班学生达到90％以上。但是，由于录取学生的标准过宽，学生文化程度不一致，又由于吸收学生时没有分析学生家庭的经济条件，因此，全校仅有一半学生能够经常坚持学习。面对这种情况，校部及时进行了整顿。准许了程度过低和家中缺少劳动力的学生退学，把余下能够坚持学习的四十七名学生重新编班划组。这样，业中就按计划坚持下来了。
            培养什么人？
    业余中学培养什么样的人？这是大渠乡在建立业中过程中一直纠缠的一个问题。
    建校初期，曾经笼统地提出过举办业中的目的是组织高小毕业生学习，为农业社培养接班人。但是，各方面对举办业中的希望和要求则是多种多样的。从农业社来说，要求业中培养技术人才和文娱活动的积极分子，教育学生好好劳动。从家长来说，经济情况较好的，希望孩子上业中补习功课，以备升学；经济情况较差的，让孩子上业中则是为了保住原有的学识，再学些生产本事。学生中想通过在业中补习，继续升学的占大多数；想通过学习，便于将来出去找工作、当乡社干部的占一半左右；只有少数人是为了更好地劳动。但是，学校没有认真地分析研究这些情况，对举办业中的方向、任务和应当掌握的原则不够明确。因此，到今年春季，当学生们看到报上发表了今年大部分中、小学毕业生不能升学和干部下放的消息以后，马上发生了思想混乱现象，学习情绪顿时下降。有些乡、社干部也怀疑举办业中的作用，说什么“中学生都要回来生产，咱还举办业中做甚？”因而放松了对业中的领导。后来由于多数学生还要求办，县委也指示一定要办好，才继续坚持下去。
    经过这一个波折，上级又给了指示，乡、社和校部都开始研究“究竟要把业中办成什么样？”的问题，经过半年多的摸索，初步明确了农民业余中学是组织在乡知识青年进行业余文化学习的一种形式。它不同于普通中学，也不同于农民业余技术学校和各种训练班。它应当紧密结合生产，通过业余课堂教学和自学，在四、五年时间内，在语文、数学等几门主要科目上，把现有相当于高小毕业的青年的文化水平提高到大致相当于初中毕业的水平，并且尽可能地根据本地生产需要学习到普通的农业科学技术知识，从而培养他们成为有文化的新式农民，在建设社会主义新农村中发挥更大的先锋作用。
    方向、任务明确了，具体问题也就好解决了。如教学内容、教学时间、教学方法等等，都有了应当遵循的原则。这些原则就是：业余、自愿、勤俭、服务于生产。
        教学内容和教学时间
    建校初期，由于方向、任务不明确，学习课程是按照普通中学的主要课程安排的。到了今年夏季，为了结合生产，课程就定为文学、算术、植物学三门，结合学习一些农业技术知识。从教学效果和学生要求来看，这些课程基本上是合适的。
    现在，随着业中的发展，又初步确定了三年到四年的学习课程，即：一年级为语文、算术（包括珠算）、生物、农业技术四门，二年级为语文、代数、生物、农业技术四门，三年级为语文、理化、农业技术三门，政治课在各年级都有，不定期的由校务委员、党、团负责干部结合中心工作讲政策、时事。
    学习时间基本上掌握了业余学习的原则。由于业中的学生分布在远近不同的村里，要完全在非生产时间进行课堂学习是不行的。因此，他们根据“不忙多学，小忙少学，大忙放学”的原则，曾占了一部分生产时间进行课堂学习。在去年冬季，是每三天上课一次，每次六小时。在春季，缩短为上午四小时。到夏季，又缩短为三个半小时。在春节期间、春耕播种期间和收麦期间，分别放假二十天、十五天和三十天。
    这样安排，离学校比较近的学生每次上课以后，回村还能参加半天劳动。离学校比较远的学生，则往往要耽误一整天时间。为了解决这一问题，农业社规定业中学生可以在学校附近的五十亩实验田里参加劳动。这样离学校比较远的学生，每逢上课那天，也能劳动半天了。
    在生产时间进行课堂学习对学生参加生产是有一定影响的，但是只要动员学生抓紧时间积极劳动，基本上能达到生产学习两不误。王家营村四个业中学生（三男一女），今年六个月内，共做工分902·8分，与同等劳力的四个未上业中的高小毕业生比较，每人平均仅少做十二个劳动日。
            怎样进行教和学
    根据课程需要，业中共聘请了三名教师。这三名教师有较高的文化水平（大学毕业），讲课也比较耐心，基本上能胜任教课任务。学校对教师特别强调了备课工作：三个教师每次上课前，都用一小时以上的时间对课文内容、教学方法、学生可能提出的疑难问题进行研究准备。教课方法上，一般地都采用了五连环的教学方法。
    由于业中是培养有文化的新式农民，因此反映在教学上就必须十分强调学以致用的教学原则，因此讲课的时候要特别注意讲清原理，联系实际，引导实用。如教语文的时候，除教授课本以外，特别注意锻炼学生写作；教数学的时候，要引导学生学会在生产中运用算术的某些原理。因此，学生们在测量土地面积的时候，在修渠计算工分的时候，以及平时计算生产比例数字的时候，都实际运用了“面积”、
  “体积”、“百分比”的计算方法。植物教师在教植物时，更运用了农村的有利条件，进行实物教学和田间教学。
    此外由于业中课堂教学时间少，必须指导学生业余自习。业中从建校起，就以村建立了自学小组，通过自学小组，复习旧课，演算作业，帮助程度差的同学学习。
        教师报酬和学校经费问题
    该乡业余中学的教师报酬问题，是本着“谁上学，谁出钱”、“误多少、补多少”、“老师学生互不吃亏”的原则解决的。建校以来，三个教师共得工分一千零二十分，每个学生平均负担四十六分。教师所得的工分和学生所付的工分，每季由校部、社的福利股和财务股负责调拨。
    学校经费开支则是由农业社公益金和学员义务劳动所得来解决。自从办校以来，本着勤俭办校的精神，共开支八十元，购买了书桌、教科书、参考书报和粉笔、纸张等。平均每月教学费用三元左右。
                领导问题
    业中是由农业社主办的，校部则由党、政、团、社等部门的负责干部和教师组成。校长由党支部宣传委员、农业社政治副社长担任，教导主任由乡文教主任和团支部宣传委员担任。规定每月召开一次校务会议，研究学校全面工作；每半月召开一次教务会议，研究教学工作。学校的日常工作，则由教导主任负责处理。
    乡的党、团组织特别注意教师和学生的思想教育工作。建校初期，学校设备比较简陋，没有桌凳，教室也不固定，不少学生对此大为不满，学习信心动摇。这时，党团支部配合校部向学生讲解了昆明某校艰苦办校的事实和红军长征、女英雄刘胡兰艰苦斗争的故事，向学生进行了艰苦学习，勤俭办校的教育。今年春天，很多学生因为不能升学思想发生了混乱。党支部针对学生的思想，系统地向学生讲解了人民日报的社论和县委发的关于劳动教育宣传提纲，讲解了中小学教育的方针、任务，学习和劳动的关系等，并且批判了一些错误思想，稳定了学生的情绪。在平时，党支部还定期给学生上政治课，进行时事政策教育。
    业中的学生都是知识青年，因此加强团的工作也很重要。共青团大渠乡总支除指派宣传委员参加校部的领导以外，还在业中建立了团的临时小组，积极协助党支部对学生进行思想教育，协助教师改进教学工作，并且指导学生进行业余自学。全校共九个自学小组，有七个小组的组长是由共青团员担任的。
                初步收获
    大渠乡的业余中学建立以来，已获得显著的成绩。
    首先，经过课堂教学和业余自学，不仅巩固住了原有的文化知识，而且系统学习了初中一年级第一学期的语文、算术、植物等课程，学生的语文、算术程度和农业生产技术知识有了显著提高。
    其次，业中学生已经成为推动乡、社生产和工作的突击力量。“业中青年突击队”是农业社的机动力量，每逢有紧急的生产任务，社里就派他们到各生产队去支援。今年麦收的时候，业中突击队就帮助西冯村生产队突击割麦一百零五亩。他们又是宣传工作、扫盲工作和各项中心工作上的一支生力军。全校已经有二十四个学生分别担任着技术员、队书记、义务教员、扫盲辅导员、读报员、板报员等职务。
    更显著的是，经过业中学习和劳动教育，绝大多数同学的思想发生了变化，他们从本乡本社的新气象中看到了农村的社会主义前途。过去说“农村没前途”，几次出外找工作的人，现在说“在农村能劳动，能学习，再撵我走我都不走了”。过去叫劳动苦的人，现在看到自己的劳动果实，也对劳动有了感情，初步养成了劳动习惯。据统计，四十七名业中学生今年在六个月里，一共作了三千五百多个劳动日。王秉谦、赵云屏、李营草等十四人，今年还荣获社和队的劳动模范的称号。因此，许多社员称赞业中学生是“能文能武的好社员”。
