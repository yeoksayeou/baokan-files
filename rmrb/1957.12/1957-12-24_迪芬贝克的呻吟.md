Notes

    Diefenbaker's Groan

    Canadian Prime Minister Diefenbaker, upon returning to Ottawa, lamented at a parliamentary session reporting on the NATO Paris conference. He stated that the military "burden of expenses will become increasingly heavy, to the point that neither this generation nor future generations will be able to bear it." For a nation's Prime Minister to both possess the self-awareness and be compelled to accept his country's unbearable military expenditure, it is evident that being a small partner tied to the chariot of a war bloc is a bitter experience.

    Diefenbaker's sigh reflects the mood of many member states within NATO. These nations now suffer from a common and dangerous ailment: military expenditure bloat.

    However, groaning is futile. To cure this ailment, one must prescribe the correct remedy. The prescription is: stop the arms race and achieve peaceful coexistence. There are no other miracle cures.

### 迪芬贝克的呻吟

    迪芬贝克的呻吟
    加拿大总理迪芬贝克刚回到渥太华，就在众议院报告北大西洋集团巴黎会议情况的会上叫苦了。他说，军事“费用的负担会越来越沉重，以至不论是现在这一代或是后代都将担负不起”。作为一个国家的总理，既有自知之明，而又必须接受自己国家力不胜任的军费负担，可见作为一个被缚在战争集团战车上的小伙计是很苦的。
    迪芬贝克的叹息反映了北大西洋集团许多成员国的心情。这些国家现在患着一种共同的危险的疾病：军费肿胀症。
    但是，呻吟是没有用的。要治好这种病，就得对症下药。方单是：停止军备竞赛，实现和平共处。其它的灵丹妙药是没有的。
