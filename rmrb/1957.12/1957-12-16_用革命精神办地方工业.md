    Run Local Industry with Revolutionary Spirit

    The Zhejiang Daily published an editorial on the 11th, which stated:

    The example of Jiaxing Paper Strip Factory overcoming all difficulties and running the enterprise diligently and frugally is a good example worthy of learning.

    When some of our comrades mention engaging in industry, they reach out to higher authorities for money, machinery, and technical personnel, as if it is impossible to run industry without meeting these requirements. Of course, it would be a good thing if the state had a large amount of funds, machinery, and technical strength to meet the needs of local areas. The problem is that our country is not yet wealthy enough. In order to accelerate the country's socialist construction, we need to use the limited funds and machinery first in the most urgent places. Our local industry, in addition to the state investing within the limits of its strength and in accordance with the overall plan, requires us to do everything possible to overcome difficulties and start from scratch. We should inherit the glorious fighting spirit of the Party's "revolution with broadswords and earthen guns" and "defeating imperialism and its running dogs with millet and rifles" to engage in local industry and overcome the difficulties we encounter today on the road of socialist construction.

    What Jiaxing Paper Strip Factory is worth learning is its consistent adherence to the principle of running the enterprise diligently and frugally. They not only overcame many difficulties to start the enterprise, but even when the enterprise developed, they still adhered to the fine tradition of careful calculation and cherishing every bit of wealth. The vast majority of employees in all industrial and mining enterprises in the province have generally improved their socialist awareness greatly through the education of the production increase and economy campaign over the years, and therefore are basically able to handle affairs in accordance with the spirit of running enterprises diligently and frugally. However, there are still some people who think that "with a large family and a large business, it doesn't matter if you spend a little more," pursuing extravagance and emphasizing so-called "standardization," wasting a lot of state funds.

    Building the country with diligence and thrift, running enterprises with diligence and thrift, running cooperatives with diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift are our long-term policies for building socialism. Not only should enterprises with many difficulties adhere to this policy, but enterprises with good conditions should also adhere to this policy; not only should we adhere to this policy now, but we should also adhere to this policy in the future. This is the fundamental path for our country to become prosperous and strong.

### 用革命精神办地方工业

    用革命精神办地方工业
    浙江日报在11日发表了一篇社论，社论里说：
    嘉兴纸筋厂克服一切困难，勤俭办企业的事例，是值得学习的良好榜样。
    我们有不少同志一提起搞工业，就伸手向上边要钱、要机器、要技术人员，好像不满足这些要求，就无法办工业似的。当然，国家如果有大量的资金、机器和技术力量来满足地方的要求，未尝不是好事。问题是，我们国家目前还不富裕，为了加快国家的社会主义建设，需要把不宽裕的资金、机器，首先用于最迫切需要的地方。我们地方工业，除国家在力量许可的范围内，按照整个计划投资外，就需要我们自己千方百计，克服困难，白手起家。我们应该继承党“大刀土枪闹革命”、“小米加步枪”打败帝国主义及其走狗的光荣战斗精神，来搞地方工业，来克服今天在社会主义建设道路上所碰到的困难。
    嘉兴纸筋厂值得学习的是一贯坚持勤俭办企业的方针。他们不仅克服了重重困难，把企业兴办起来；即使在企业有所发展时，他们还是坚持精打细算、珍惜点滴财富的优良作风。本省所有工矿企业绝大部分职工，经过历年来增产节约运动的教育，社会主义觉悟一般都有很大提高，因而基本上是能够按照勤俭办企业的精神来办事的。但是，也还有些人认为“家大业大，多花一点没啥”，追求铺张阔绰，强调所谓“正规化”，浪费了国家许多资金。
    勤俭建国，勤俭办企业，勤俭办合作社，勤俭办一切事业，是我们建设社会主义的长远方针。不仅困难多的企业应该坚持这个方针，条件好的企业也应该坚持这个方针；不仅当前应该坚持这个方针，将来也要坚持这个方针。这是我国走向富强的根本道路。
