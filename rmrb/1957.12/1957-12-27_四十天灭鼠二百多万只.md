Frontline of Eliminating the Four Pests

    Two Million Rats Eradicated in Forty Days
    Fuzhou City launched a winter campaign to eliminate pests and protect grain. From October 25th to December 5th, in forty days, the city captured more than 2,020,000 rats.
    After listening to the live broadcast of the mobilization meeting to realize the National Program for Agricultural Development, people from all walks of life in Fuzhou City became unprecedentedly enthusiastic about eliminating the four pests, and many active rat catchers emerged. Zhang Bolong, the head of Taijiang District, took the lead actively. The medical staff in the district went all out, working early and late, going deep into households to set up mousetraps, and running to the suburbs to dig rat holes. In just over a month, the district captured more than 980,000 rats. Yuanyang Elementary School mobilized students to combine extracurricular activities, taking hoes and brooms to the field ridges and pond banks to dig rat holes, and launched a rat-catching competition, capturing more than 20,000 rats. Hengyu Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs used the spare time of production to thoroughly turn over haystacks and dig rat holes, also capturing more than 17,000 rats.

    四十天灭鼠二百多万只
    福州市开展冬季除害保粮运动，从10月25日至12月5日的四十天中，全市捕到二百零二万多只老鼠。
    福州市各阶层人民收听了实现农业发展纲要动员大会实况广播后，除四害积极性空前高涨，出现了不少捕鼠积极分子。台江区区长张伯龙积极带头。该区医务人员全力以赴，起早摸黑，深入各户布设鼠夹，跑到郊外挖鼠洞，仅在一个多月时间，全区就捕了九十八万多只老鼠。远洋小学发动学生结合课外活动，带着锄头、扫帚到田塍、塘埂挖鼠洞，开展捕鼠竞赛，捕了二万多只老鼠。郊区横屿农业社利用生产空隙时间，全面翻草堆、掘鼠洞，也捕了一万七千多只老鼠。
