　　The Basis for Negotiation
　　By a Commentator of this Newspaper

    The United Nations General Assembly has adopted a proposal on the Algerian question, requesting France and Algeria to "conduct preliminary negotiations in a spirit of effective cooperation." People hope to see such negotiations begin quickly and lead to a peaceful resolution of the Algerian question.

    To immediately conduct negotiations to peacefully resolve the Algerian question is not only in the interests of the Algerian people but also in the national interests of France. However, for a long time before this, French colonialists, who believed in the power of the gun, stubbornly refused to do so. They sophistically argued that the Algerian National Liberation Front was not qualified to be a negotiating party, insisting that negotiations could only take place after a ceasefire and elections. This closed the door to negotiations and blocked the path to a peaceful resolution.

    During the discussions in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, French Foreign Minister Pineau repeatedly reiterated this colonialist fallacy. However, apart from representatives of a few countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom who supported France, the vast majority of countries' representatives sternly condemned France's colonialist policy in Algeria in their speeches. Colonialists were in a very isolated position at the meeting. Compared to the previous General Assembly, anti-colonialist sentiment and strength have grown significantly. Seven countries, including Argentina and Spain, had put forward a proposal to extricate France, but withdrew it because they saw the situation was unfavorable. At the same time, on the battlefield in Algeria, French colonialists were also in a very embarrassing situation. The Algerian people's national liberation war has expanded to the whole country, and the National Liberation Army's all-out offensive launched in commemoration of the third anniversary of the armed struggle has left the French colonial army beaten everywhere and exhausted. The balance of international forces, the war situation in Algeria, and the moral pressure of the whole world have forced French colonialists to consider new countermeasures.

    After the adoption of the proposal by the United Nations General Assembly, Pineau's reflection of France's attitude towards negotiations gives people no reason to be optimistic. If French colonialists continue to disregard the will and national rights of the Algerian people, negotiations will lack a foundation for success.

    The Algerian National Liberation Front has already expressed a clear attitude towards the proposal adopted by the United Nations General Assembly: agreeing to negotiate a peaceful solution based on the independence of Algeria. Recognizing the Algerian people's right to national independence is a necessary foundation for negotiations. Only on this basis can negotiations achieve a reasonable result. The "solution consistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter" mentioned in the proposal adopted by the United Nations General Assembly should only mean that the Algerian people's desire for independence is respected.

　　谈判的基础
　　本报评论员
    联合国大会就阿尔及利亚问题通过了一项提案，要求法国和阿尔及利亚双方“本着有效合作的精神进行预备谈判”。人们希望看到这种谈判能够迅速开始，并且导致阿尔及利亚问题的和平解决。
    立即进行谈判来和平解决阿尔及利亚问题，这不仅符合阿尔及利亚人民的利益，也符合法国的民族利益。但是，在此以前的长时间内，迷信于大炮发言权的法国殖民主义者却一直横蛮地拒绝这样做。他们强词夺理地说阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线没有资格作为谈判的一方，坚持只有在停火—选举以后才可能进行谈判。这就关死了谈判的大门，也就堵死了和平解决的道路。
    在这次联合国大会政治委员会的讨论中，法国外交部长比诺还不止一次地重复这种殖民主义的谬论。但是，除了美国、英国等少数国家的代表为法国帮腔以外，绝大部分国家的代表在发言中严正地谴责了法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民主义政策。殖民主义者在会上处于非常孤立的地位。比起上一届大会来，反殖民主义的情绪和力量又有了明显的增长。阿根廷、西班牙等七国曾经提出了一个提案来为法国解脱，也因为看到形势不对而撤回了。同时，在阿尔及利亚的战场上，法国殖民者也处于狼狈不堪的境地。阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放战争已经扩大到全国范围，民族解放军为纪念武装斗争三周年全面发动的攻击战，使法国殖民军到处挨打，疲于奔命。国际力量的对比，阿尔及利亚的战争形势，以及全世界道义的压力，使得法国殖民主义者就不得不考虑新的对策。
    在联合国大会的提案通过以后，比诺所反映的法国对谈判的态度使人没有理由乐观。法国殖民主义者如果仍然无视阿尔及利亚人民的意志和民族权利，谈判就缺乏成功的基础。
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线对联合国大会通过的提案已经表示了明确的态度：同意谈判一项在阿尔及利亚取得独立基础上的和平解决办法。承认阿尔及利亚人民的民族独立权利，这是谈判所必须有的基础。只有在这个基础上，谈判才能得到合理的结果。联合国大会通过的提案中提到的“符合于联合国宪章的宗旨和原则的解决办法”，只应当是意味着阿尔及利亚人民要求独立的愿望得到尊重。
