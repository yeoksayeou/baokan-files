    Modern Cave Dwellers
    Matera is the capital of Matera Province in southern Italy, with a population of less than 30,000. According to official Italian figures, about 8,000 of Matera's 30,000 residents are homeless and have nowhere to live, so they have to live in 1,700 caves of various sizes near the city, becoming modern cave dwellers.
    As early as May 1952, in order to save face, the Italian government announced a ban on the slum caves of Matera and prohibited people from living there. The Italian government also built some simple houses and asked the cave dwellers to move in, but the rent for these houses was unaffordable for the cave dwellers, and the few who moved in complained bitterly. The Italian government originally intended to use the construction of simple houses as a means of solving the unemployment problem, but these few houses are now almost completed, but the intensification of the unemployment problem has increased rather than decreased. Therefore, the cave dwelling problem still cannot be solved.

    现代的穴居人
    马特拉城是意大利南部马特拉省的首府，人口不到三万。据意大利官方公布的数字，马特拉城的三万居民里约有八千人没有房屋，无处栖身，只得住在该城附近一千七百个大大小小的山洞里，成了现代的穴居人。
    早在1952年5月，意大利政府为了装点门面，宣布取缔马特拉城的贫民洞窟，禁止人们前往居住。意大利政府并建造了若干简陋的住宅，要求穴居人迁入，但是这些住宅的租金是穴居人所担负不起的，少数迁进去了的人也叫苦不迭。意大利政府本来想利用建筑简陋住宅作为解决失业问题的一个手段，现在这些为数不多的住宅已经快要全部完工了，可是失业问题的尖锐化有增无减。因此，穴居问题还是不能解决。
