    Building Water Conservancy Projects, Conserving Water and Soil, Overcoming Drought
    Gansu Transforms from Grain-Deficient Province to Grain-Surplus Province
    (Our Dispatch) The people of Gansu have been actively building water conservancy projects for years, changing the face of drought and ensuring increased grain production, achieving great success. The historically grain-deficient province has been transformed into a grain-surplus province.
    More than half of the counties in Gansu Province (more than fifty counties) are threatened by varying degrees of drought, among which twenty-nine counties are particularly prone to "nine droughts in ten years." Soil erosion is also severe, with soil erosion in the Yellow River basin within the province reaching 2.1 million square kilometers. In the past, people's lives were extremely impoverished.
    After liberation, during the land reform movement, the Party began to lead the masses in repairing existing water conservancy facilities, improving management systems and irrigation methods, and building some new water conservancy projects. In 1954, the Provincial Party Committee put forward the call to "build water conservancy projects, conserve water and soil, and change the drought-stricken face of Gansu," which was enthusiastically supported by the people of all ethnic groups. Especially after the realization of agricultural cooperativization and the implementation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), a huge upsurge in building water conservancy projects and conserving water and soil was launched among the masses.
    Party organizations at all levels in Gansu, relying on the masses and focusing on small-scale water conservancy projects, and paying attention to the mass line in their work, have given fuller play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses in building water conservancy projects. With resolute labor spirit, the masses have tried every means to store rainwater from the sky, dig out groundwater, and divert water from rivers, creating many amazing feats. For example, the masses in Baijiashan, Wushan County, relying on their own strength, cut through mountains and filled gullies, building a 60-li-long Dongliang Canal, diverting river water to the high mountains at an altitude of 1,912 meters above sea level. The project was extremely arduous.
    After several years of fighting drought, the irrigated area in Gansu Province has expanded from 6.89 million mu in 1952 to more than 15 million mu, exceeding the total area of water conservancy projects built in the past 2,000 years. On average, each agricultural person has more than one mu of watered land and irrigated land. Because the threat of drought has been reduced, grain production has greatly increased. Because dry land has been turned into watered land or irrigated land, the output has generally increased by three or four times, and some even as high as seven or eight times. Many places have seen "thousand-jin mu." The total grain output of the province increased by one time from 1952 to 1956. Although there was a drought this year, and it did not even rain for several months in some places, the total grain output still reached 10.3 billion jin, enough for the people of the province to eat for one year and four months. The average grain possession per person in the province increased from 507 jin in 1952 to 735 jin (including feed and seeds). Thus, a historically grain-deficient province has become a grain-surplus province. At the same time, the average annual income of each farmer increased from 77 yuan in 1952 to 110 yuan in 1957. When implementing the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on launching large-scale farmland water conservancy construction and manure accumulation movements this winter and next spring," the Provincial Party Committee requested all localities to conscientiously complete the task of irrigating 3.5 million mu of land and conserving water and soil over 20,000 square kilometers. It requires drought-stricken areas to strive to have 1.5 mu of irrigated land per person, or 1 mu of irrigated land plus 2 mu of flood land or sand-covered land, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, to ensure that each person has a grain output of 1,000 jin in normal years and no less than 500 jin in drought years.
    Now, the movement to build water conservancy projects in Gansu Province is rapidly developing. The water conservancy projects built in Pingliang, Huating, Longde, Zhenyuan, Tianshui, Qingshui, Qin'an, Zhangjiachuan, Lixian, Liangdang, Wushan, Yongchang, Jinta, Zhuanglang, Tongwei, Huichuan, and Xiahe seventeen counties and cities have achieved the requirements of being numerous, fast, good, and economical. In more than fifty days, a total of 940,000 mu of new irrigated land has been built. In addition to making up for the unfinished water conservancy construction tasks in 1957, the 1958 tasks were completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target, with many counties overfulfilling one-half to one time of the 1958 tasks. Although many of the water lands built this time are on high mountains and Gobi deserts, the quality is generally very good, and irrigation is carried out while building.
    In nearly two months, Gansu Province has built 2.46 million mu of new water land. In addition to completing the tail-end projects of 1957, it completed 2.14 million mu of the 1958 task, accounting for 61.2% of the 1958 task.

### 兴修水利　保持水土　战胜干旱  甘肃由缺粮省变成余粮省

    兴修水利　保持水土　战胜干旱
    甘肃由缺粮省变成余粮省
    本报讯　甘肃人民连年积极兴修水利，改变干旱面貌，保证粮食增产，已取得巨大的成就，历史上的缺粮省已经变成了余粮省。
    甘肃全省有半数以上的县（五十多县）受到程度不同的干旱威胁，其中二十九个县，更是“十年九旱”。水土流失也很严重，仅境内黄河流域水土流失的面积即达二百一十万平方公里。过去人民的生活极为贫困。
    解放后，在土地改革运动中，党就着手领导群众整修原有的水利设备，改进管理制度和灌溉方法，并兴修了一部分水利。1954年，省委提出“兴修水利，保持水土，改变甘肃干旱面貌”的号召，获得各族劳动人民热烈拥护。特别在实现农业合作化，和贯彻执行了全国农业发展纲要（草案）以后，在群众中就掀起了规模巨大的兴修水利、保持水土的热潮。
    甘肃各级党组织依靠群众以小型水利为主，和工作中注意走群众路线，更充分发挥了群众兴修水利的积极性、创造性。群众以坚毅的劳动精神，想尽一切办法，把天上落下的水蓄起来，把地下的水挖出来，把河里的水引上来，创造许多惊人的事迹。例如武山县柏家山的群众，在高山大岭中，靠自己的力量，劈山填沟，修了一条六十华里长的东梁渠，把河水引上拔海一千九百一十二公尺的高山。工程十分艰巨。
    甘肃群众经过几年与干旱的斗争，现在全省灌溉面积已由1952年的六百八十九万亩，扩大到一千五百多万亩，超过了历史上二千多年来兴修水利面积的总和，农业人口每人平均有一亩多水地和水浇地。因为干旱威胁减少，粮食产量大大提高。因旱地变为水地或水浇地，一般产量都提高三、四倍，有的高达七、八倍。很多地方出现了“千斤亩”。全省粮食总产量从1952年到1956年，增长了一倍。今年虽然遭了干旱，有的地方甚至几个月未落雨，但是粮食总产量仍然达到一百零三亿斤，足够全省人民吃一年四个月。全省人口，平均占有粮由1952年的五百零七斤，增长到七百三十五斤（包括饲料、种子在内）。至此，一个历史上缺粮省变成了余粮省。同时每个农民平均年收入由1952年的七十七元，到1957年增加到一百一十元。省委在贯彻中共中央和国务院“关于今冬明春大规模地开展兴修农田水利和积肥运动的决定”时，要求各地认真完成灌溉面积三百五十万亩和水土保持二万平方公里的任务。要求干旱地区在第二个五年计划期内，争取每人有一亩半水浇地，或一亩水浇地加二亩洪水地或铺砂地，以保证在正常年景每人有一千斤粮食产量，旱年不少于五百斤。
    现在，甘肃省兴修水利的运动正在迅速开展。平凉、华亭、隆德、镇原、天水、清水、秦安、张家川、礼县、两当、武山、永昌、金塔、庄浪、通渭、会川和夏河十七个县、市兴建的水利工程达到了又多、又快、又好、又省的要求。在五十多天时间内，共新修了水地九十四万亩，除补足1957年未完成的水利建设任务外，还提前超额完成了1958年任务，许多县超额完成1958年任务的一半到一倍。这次所修的水地虽然有许多在高山和戈壁滩上，但是质量一般都很好，做到了边修边灌溉。
    在将近两个月里，甘肃全省新修水地二百四十六万亩，除完成1957年的尾欠工程外，并完成1958年任务二百一十四万亩，占1958年任务的61.2％。
