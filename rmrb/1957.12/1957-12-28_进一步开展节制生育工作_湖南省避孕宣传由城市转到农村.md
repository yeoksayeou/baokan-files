    Further Promote Birth Control Work
    Hunan Province Shifts Family Planning Propaganda from Cities to Rural Areas
    (Our newspaper reports) Birth control propaganda and guidance are currently being vigorously carried out in Hunan Province, gradually shifting from urban areas to rural areas. Throughout the province's ninety-five counties and cities, with the exception of a few ethnic minority areas and mountainous regions, family planning propaganda and guidance organizations have generally been established. A large number of propaganda and guidance personnel have been trained, and various methods such as small mobile exhibitions, seminars, and home visits have been widely adopted for propaganda. These campaigns have yielded good results.
    In order to further carry out family planning work throughout the province, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hunan Provincial People's Committee jointly issued "Instructions on Further Promoting Birth Control Work" on November 1st. The instructions required all medical institutions in the province, wherever conditions permit, to set up contraception clinics for guidance and to conduct propaganda to the masses at any time. It also required all localities to continue to complete the training of cadres, in principle, each agricultural cooperative with more than 150 households should train one midwife and one director of the women's representative meeting. The instructions also required local health departments and pharmaceutical companies to closely cooperate to ensure the supply of contraceptives and medicines to meet the needs of the people.

    进一步开展节制生育工作
    湖南省避孕宣传由城市转到农村
    本报讯　节制生育的宣传和指导工作，目前正在湖南省深入开展，逐步由城镇转入到农村。全省九十五个县市除少数民族地区和山区外，一般都成立了节育宣传指导机构，训练了大批宣传和指导骨干，广泛地采用了小型流动展览会、座谈会、家庭访问等各种各样的方式进行宣传。这些宣传已经收到良好的效果。
    为了在全省范围内进一步开展节育工作，中共湖南省委、湖南省人民委员会在11月1日联合发出：“关于进一步开展节制生育工作的指示”，要求全省各地医疗机构，凡是有条件的，都必须设置避孕门诊指导，并且随时向群众进行宣传；要求各地继续完成训练干部的工作，原则上一百五十户以上的农业社每社要训练接生员、妇女代表会主任各一名；要求各地卫生部门和医药公司密切联系，做好避孕工具和药品的供应工作，满足人民群众的需要。　（麓安）
