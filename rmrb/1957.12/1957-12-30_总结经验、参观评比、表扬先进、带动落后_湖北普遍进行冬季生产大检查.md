Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 29th: Hubei Province is universally conducting winter agricultural production inspections, promptly summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, and overcoming shortcomings. The characteristics of Hubei Province's winter production this year are: early start, large scale, and full of vigor. Currently, millions of men and women are投入投入 into the winter production upsurge every day, with an attendance rate generally reaching over 80% of the total labor force.

However, according to inspections, there are still many problems that urgently need to be solved in the high tide of winter agricultural production in Hubei Province. The most prominent problem is that the development of the movement is still unbalanced and incomplete. In some advanced counties, there are still about 15% of townships and cooperatives that lack vigor and have serious conservative thinking, and about 5% of the townships and cooperatives are dead spots. The incompleteness is mainly manifested in the fact that some areas only focus on water conservancy construction and manure accumulation, while field management and sideline production, which are of great significance for next year's production leap forward, are either not the responsibility of anyone or are completely ignored. In some places, leaders have set these tasks against water conservancy construction and manure accumulation. Individual district committees even forbid farmers from engaging in sideline occupations. Some areas only pursue the quantity of water conservancy projects, ignoring the issue of project quality. According to inspections, the quality of most of the water conservancy projects built this year is good, with about 90% being up to standard, but about 10% are of poor quality, and some individual projects have not even achieved the expected results. Subjectivism and bureaucratism on the part of leaders in a few areas have also hindered the normal development of the production upsurge. According to an analysis by relevant departments in Hubei Province, the main reason for the above problems is leadership issues. Wherever leaders have conservative ideas, production vigor is insufficient; incomplete production is because leaders have one-sided thinking and lack comprehensive arrangements for the labor force, only focusing on the central work and losing sight of the whole picture; in addition, some area leaders are not modest in learning from others and work blindly, causing them to make mistakes that others have already solved; furthermore, the poor mass work foundation and the failure to carry out socialist education well in some areas are also reasons why the winter production movement has not been carried out well.

According to the instructions of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, most areas of the province have adopted the method of combining leadership with the masses since mid-December to inspect winter production. In the inspection, the masses were mobilized to summarize experiences, visit and evaluate, commend the advanced, and lead the backward. This method combines discovering problems and solving problems, with good results. In Nanzhang County, the progress of one hundred and thirty-one agricultural cooperatives in jointly building a large canal was very unbalanced. The relevant leaders organized cadres above the level of team leader from these cooperatives to visit and evaluate, and selected advanced units and individuals. As a result, those backward cooperatives quickly became active. Xiangyang County's Nizui Township originally planned to build a canal and subjectively proposed the slogan "Open mountains when encountering mountains, and break ridges when encountering ridges." Following this slogan would require 80,000 workdays. After visiting and learning from the experience of other places, they changed it to "Circumvent mountains, bypass ridges," which only requires 20,000 workdays, and the masses are very satisfied. In order to overcome the problem of incomplete leadership, some counties have proposed improving tools, increasing work efficiency, and actively reducing some obviously oversized plans that cannot be completed this year, and comprehensively arranging the labor force, with water conservancy and manure accumulation as the center, to promote the comprehensive development of winter production. Currently, Wang Renzhong, the first secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and other responsible cadres have gone to the countryside to help various places solve specific problems and lay a solid foundation for next year's production leap forward.

    总结经验、参观评比、表扬先进、带动落后
    湖北普遍进行冬季生产大检查
    据新华社武汉29日电　湖北省各地正普遍进行冬季农业生产大检查，及时总结推广先进经验，克服缺点。湖北省今年冬季生产的特点是：动手早、规模大、劲头足。目前，每天有数百万男女劳动力投入冬季生产热潮，出勤率一般都达到全部劳动力的80％以上。
    但是，据检查，湖北省冬季农业生产高潮中仍然存在着不少急待解决的问题。最突出的问题是运动的发展还不平衡、不全面。一些先进县中仍有15％左右的乡、社劲头不足，保守思想严重，而且还有5％左右的乡社是死角。不全面主要表现在一些地区只重视兴修水利和积肥，对明年生产大跃进有重要意义的田间管理和副业生产，无人负责或完全被忽视，有的地方领导上把这些工作与兴修水利、积肥对立起来，个别区委甚至不准农民搞副业。某些地区只追求水利工程的数量，忽视工程质量的问题，仍然存在。据检查，今年修的水利工程质量大部分是好的，90％左右合格，但仍有10％左右质量差，甚至有个别工程没有达到预期效果。少数地区领导上的主观主义和官僚主义也妨碍了生产高潮的正常发展。据湖北省有关部门分析，产生上述问题的主要原因是领导问题。凡是哪里领导上有保守思想，那里生产劲头就不足；生产不全面则是因为领导思想上有片面性，对劳动力缺乏全面安排，只抓了中心工作，丢了全面；还有些地区领导上不虚心向别人学习，盲目地干，致使别人早已解决的问题，他们还犯了错误；此外，某些地区由于群众工作基础差和没有很好进行社会主义教育，也是冬季生产运动开展不好的原因之一。
    根据中共湖北省委的指示，全省大部地区从12月中旬开始，采用了领导与群众相结合的方法，对冬季生产进行了检查。在检查中发动群众总结经验，参观评比，表扬先进，带动落后。这种方法使发现问题和解决问题相结合，收效很好。南漳县一百三十一个农业合作社在合修一条大渠中，进度很不平衡。有关领导方面组织这些社队长以上干部参观评比，选出先进单位和人物，这样一来，那些落后社迅速积极起来。襄阳县泥嘴乡原来计划修一条渠，并且主观主义地提出了“逢山开山、逢岗破岗”的口号，根据这个口号去做需要八万个工，经过参观学习别处的经验后，改为“逢山盘山，逢岗绕岗”，只要二万工就够了，群众都很满意。为了克服领导不全面的问题，有的县已提出改良工具，提高工效，主动收缩一些显然今年不能完成的过大的计划，全面安排了劳动力，以水利积肥为中心把冬季生产推向全面发展。目前，中共湖北省委第一书记王任重等负责干部都已下乡，帮助各地具体解决问题，使明年的生产大跃进建立在可靠的基础上。
