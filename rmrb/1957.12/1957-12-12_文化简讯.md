　　Ming and Qing Dynasty Paintings Exhibited at the Palace Museum
    The painting gallery of the Palace Museum recently exhibited famous paintings from the Ming and Qing dynasties. There are over 400 works on display this time. Except for a few pieces, such as Zhou Chen's "Spring Mountain Outing" and Yuan Jiang's "Penglai Immortal Island," which have been exhibited before, two-thirds of the works have never been exhibited before. These newly added paintings are mostly masterpieces. Among the Ming dynasty paintings are Wang Lü's "Mount Hua," Dai Jin's "Three Visits to the Thatched Cottage," Lü Ji's "Antarctic Immortal," Wu Wei's "Wuling Spring," Xu Wei's "Ink Grapes," Wen Zhengming's "Snow Mountain," and Qiu Ying's "Secluded Life in Peach Blossom Spring." Qing dynasty paintings include Zhu Da's (Bada Shanren) "Willow Creek Bathing Birds," Daoji's "Cloud Mountain" and "Cai Shi Ji" diptych, Wu Li's "Fuchun Daling" (four pieces), Hua Yan's "Eight Hundred Longevity," Zheng Xie's (Banqiao) "Orchids and Bamboo," as well as many excellent works by famous painters such as Liu Jue, Xie Shichen, Dong Qichang, Chen Hongshou, Mei Qing, Yun Shouping, Wang Hui, Wang Yuanqi, Zhao Zhiqian, Ren Xiong, and Ren Yi.
    Lü Ji of the Ming dynasty was famous for his flower and bird paintings. His "Autumn Pond Lotus and Heron" and "Osmanthus and Chrysanthemum with Mountain Birds," exhibited last year, were well received by the audience. The "Antarctic Immortal" exhibited this time has simple brushstrokes and a vivid image, making it a rare and excellent painting. "Ink Grapes" is Xu Wei's representative work, with its ink flowing freely. Qiu Ying's "Secluded Life in Peach Blossom Spring" is a rare treasure with its meticulous brushwork.
    The Palace Museum has a large collection of Ming and Qing dynasty paintings, and it will rotate the exhibits from time to time during the exhibition period. (Tian Wenxiu)
    New Films Recently Produced
    The Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio has recently completed many new films. Among them, "Cooperativization is Very Good" refutes the slanders of landlords, rich peasants, and rightists who vilified cooperativization with the facts of the bumper harvest of the Jinxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing after its establishment. "Welcome Friends from the Festival" records the visit to China of youth representatives from 25 countries, including the United States and West Germany, who participated in the 6th World Youth Festival. "National Track and Field Games" records the track and field competition held in Nanjing in October this year, including the actual performance of Zheng Fengrong, the athlete who set the world record for women's high jump. In addition, there is also the short film "Conquering the Flood Peak," reflecting the people of Harbin building dikes to prevent floods.
    In addition to the black-and-white films "Transforming Low-Lying Areas" and the newsreel special "Rectification While Reforming, Cadres Sent Down," which are currently being produced, there are also color documentaries "Congratulations" (recording the actual situation of Chairman Mao leading the Chinese government delegation to Moscow to attend the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution), "Art Troupes from Various Countries in China," "Song of Mount Everest," "Sanmenxia," and the wide-screen large-scale color documentary "1957 National Day".

    Opening of Tianjin Wide-Screen Cinema
    Tianjin's first wide-screen cinema has opened. The projection area of this wide screen is 12 meters wide and 4.7 meters high, and it is slightly curved. Behind the screen and inside the surrounding walls of the audience seating area, there are more than 20 loudspeakers, forming a three-dimensional sound transmission network. Various sounds can come from different directions with the movements of the characters on stage, distinguishing between up, down, left, right, far, and near. For example, when showing battle scenes, the entire venue is filled with the sound of gunfire, giving the audience a sense of being on the battlefield. This wide-screen cinema can accommodate more than 900 audience members per show.

　　故宫博物院展出明清绘画
    故宫博物院绘画馆最近展出明、清两代的著名绘画。这次展出的作品有四百多幅，除周臣的“春山游骑图”、袁江的“蓬莱仙岛图”等少数作品曾经展出过外，有三分之二的作品都是过去没有展出过的。这些新增加的画品，大多是佳作。明代画品中有王履的“华山图”，戴进的“三顾草芦图”，吕纪的“南极老人图”，吴伟的“武陵春图”，徐渭的“墨葡萄图”，文徵明的“雪山图”，仇英的“桃园高隐图”。清代画品中有朱耷（八大山人）的“柳溪浴禽图”，道济的“云山图”、“采石矶图”对幅，吴历的“富春大岭图”等四幅，华岩的“八百遐龄图”，郑燮（板桥）的“兰竹图”，以及著名画家刘珏、谢时臣、董其昌、陈洪绶、梅清、恽寿平、王翬、王原祁、赵之谦、任熊和任颐等许多优秀作品。
    明代吕纪以花鸟画著名，去年展出他的“秋塘荷鹭图”和“桂菊山禽图”，受到观众的好评；这次展出的“南极老人图”，用笔简略，形象生动，是一幅少见的好画。“墨葡萄图”，墨气淋漓，是徐渭的代表作。仇英的“桃园高隐图”，笔调细致，是一件难得的珍品。
