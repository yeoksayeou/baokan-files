    Some small ideas:
    Want to know how to make rubber shoes more durable? Then you must first understand the conditions under which rubber shoes are most easily damaged. Rubber shoes that have just been washed and placed in the sun to bake will become hard and brittle after a long time; if you put wet rubber shoes next to a coal stove to bake, the rubber will become soft and sticky; if the rubber shoes are stained with oil or decaying matter, they will also easily become brittle and cracked. These phenomena all show that the performance of rubber will change and lose its toughness and elasticity when exposed to light, heat, and oxidation. This change is called rubber aging. And oxidation is the main cause of rubber aging.
    In order to make rubber shoes durable, we must pay attention to keeping the rubber shoes clean. Because greasy and unclean objects easily cause rubber to oxidize and crack. If washing rubber shoes, they should be dried in a dark and ventilated place. Never put them in the sun or bake them near a stove, and do not put them in a damp place. This can greatly extend the life of rubber shoes. (Lun)

    能使胶鞋耐穿些吗？
    你想知道怎样使胶鞋耐穿吗？那么先要了解胶鞋在什么情况下最容易坏。刚洗干净的胶鞋放在阳光下曝晒，久后就会发现胶鞋变硬而脆裂了；如果将湿的胶鞋放在煤炉边烤，那么胶会变软而发粘；若是胶鞋上沾有油污或腐败物，也易发脆而龟裂。这些现象都说明，橡胶受了光、热和氧化作用，性能会发生变化，失去坚韧性和弹性。这种变化称为橡胶的老化。而氧化作用又是橡胶老化的主要原因。
    为了使胶鞋耐穿，我们就必须注意保持胶鞋的清洁。因为油腻和不洁物容易使橡胶发生氧化而龟裂。如果洗胶鞋，应该把它放在阴暗通风处晾干，千万不要放在阳光下晒或火炉边烤，也不要放在潮湿的地方。这样就可以大大地延长胶鞋的寿命。　（伦）
