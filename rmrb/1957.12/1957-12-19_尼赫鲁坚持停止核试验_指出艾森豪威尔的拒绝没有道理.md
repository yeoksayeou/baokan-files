Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 18th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, in his speech concluding the foreign policy debate in the People's House of Parliament on the 17th, expressed his disagreement with the reasons given by US President Eisenhower for refusing to stop nuclear explosion tests.

Eisenhower, in a recent letter to Nehru, stated that the US government was unwilling to stop nuclear explosion tests due to fear of a "surprise attack."

Nehru said that he did not see any connection between Eisenhower's fear of a surprise attack and stopping nuclear explosion tests. He further stated: "I personally don't see why the possibility of a surprise attack would increase after stopping nuclear (explosion) tests."

He also said that he personally believed that "at present, or in the foreseeable future, no government or people of any country want war. If that is the case, then within this period, any possible factors for a surprise attack are very small, not to mention the fact that a surprise attack can be carried out with or without tests."

He also said that he also supported reaching a comprehensive agreement on disarmament, but his current call was that a first step should be taken, and then the next step would follow. He emphasized that stopping nuclear explosion tests should be the first step in disarmament.

In his speech, Nehru also reiterated India's support for Indonesia's claim to West Irian.

### 尼赫鲁坚持停止核试验  指出艾森豪威尔的拒绝没有道理

　　尼赫鲁坚持停止核试验
    指出艾森豪威尔的拒绝没有道理
    据新华社新德里18日电　印度总理尼赫鲁17日在国会人民院结束外交政策辩论的讲话中，表示不同意美国总统艾森豪威尔提出的拒绝停止核爆炸试验的理由。
    艾森豪威尔在最近给尼赫鲁的回信中曾经表示，美国政府是由于害怕“突然袭击”而不愿停止核爆炸试验。
    尼赫鲁说，他看不出艾森豪威尔对突然袭击的恐惧和停止核爆炸试验这两者之间有什么联系。他又说：“我个人看不出为什么在停止核（爆炸）试验以后，突然袭击的可能性会增加。”
    他还说，他个人相信，“在目前，或者在可以预见的将来，没有一个国家的政府和人民希望战争。如果是这样的话，那么在这个时期内，发生突然袭击的任何可能因素都是很小的，且不提这个事实：突然袭击是在无论有没有试验的情况下都可以进行的。”
    他还说，他也赞成就裁军达成全面的协议，但是他当前的呼吁是：应该先采取一个步骤，而后下一步骤就会随之而来。他强调应以停止核爆炸试验作为裁军的第一个步骤。
    尼赫鲁的讲话中，还重申印度支持印度尼西亚对西伊里安的要求。
