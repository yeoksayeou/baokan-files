The Eight of Them

The People's Daily published a news item on November 27th about eight cadres from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League who were sent to work in the Hongxing and Wuyi Agricultural Cooperatives in Ping顺 County, Shanxi Province, and were selected as excellent members. Many readers are concerned about their work and living conditions. The following is a recent letter from these eight comrades. Editor:
    We eight people, responding to the call of the Party, arrived at a village in the Taihang Mountains—Yangwei Township—on September 30th, and were assigned to participate in labor in six production teams of the Hongxing and Wuyi Agricultural Cooperatives.
    In these two months or so, we have received warm welcomes and meticulous care from the Party, government organizations, and the masses here. What is most unforgettable to us is that on the day we arrived here, it was already dark, and the villagers had worked for a day, without even eating dinner. Five or six hundred people, men, women, old and young, went two or three miles out of the village, beating gongs and drums to greet us. When we broke our hands for the first time, the cooperative members felt more pain than if they had broken their own hands, asking us if our hands were better when they saw us. Especially recently, the two cooperatives selected us as excellent members, which made us even more uneasy, feeling unworthy. We have not yet obtained farmer qualifications, so how can we be worthy of being excellent members? All of this has encouraged our labor enthusiasm and determination to overcome difficulties. We know that the masses welcome, care for, and encourage us in this way because they love the Party. As old man Song Jinqun said, "The Party has not forgotten the people in the mountainous areas. Today, it has also sent cadres to eat, live, and work with us. Chairman Mao is truly wise and great."
    We participated in autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, basic farmland water conservancy construction, afforestation, and manure accumulation. Through these labors, we changed the mistaken view we had before coming here that agricultural production is simple and only requires strength, and at the same time, we improved our labor ability. When we harvested grain for the first time, although the production team sent experienced old farmers to teach us the basic movements of how to hold the knife, grasp the grain, and cut, when we started to work, the sickle would not listen to our commands, not only failing to meet the quality requirements of grasping the ears and cutting low stubble, but also exhausting us with sweat all over our faces, and within half an hour, our hands were covered with blisters. Once, we went to dig radishes with the cooperative members, thinking it was a simple matter, just using a hoe to dig them out, but when we started digging, we damaged many radishes. We couldn't even do the simple task of pouring water into the vat. Not only could we not pour it in like the villagers without putting down the carrying pole, but even if we put down the carrying pole and used both hands to lift a bucket of water to pour it in, water would splash all over the ground. As for carrying two bundles of grain weighing a hundred pounds or so and walking five or six miles on mountain roads without resting in between, we didn't even dare to try. The ridiculous thing was that we followed behind empty-handed, still afraid of falling into the mountain沟里, and sometimes our hands had to help our feet. Comrades sighed and said, "You really have to learn everything, even walking." When we first arrived, not to mention working, just climbing five or six miles of mountain roads to get to the fields every day was already exhausting, and after working for a day, we felt exhausted, with sore backs and legs. But we did not bow our heads to difficulties. If we didn't know how to do something, we humbly learned from the farmers. If we didn't have enough physical strength, we gritted our teeth and exercised. Now our physical strength has greatly increased, and we can carry a load of a hundred pounds or so continuously for half a day. Recently, we went to the county to attend a meeting, walked forty miles of mountain roads, and didn't feel tired at all. Comrades jokingly said that after returning to Beijing, we won't have to take the bus to go to the city on Sundays anymore. We deeply realized that transforming oneself through labor is not a difficult thing for people with perseverance, but it is not an easy thing for people with weak will. Labor is a pleasant thing for working people who have labor habits, but it is indeed an arduous process for intellectuals who do not have labor habits.
    The masses' excellent qualities of hard work and frugality are worth learning from. For example, even though there is enough grain to eat, they generally add some bran and vegetables; when eating cabbage, not only are the outer old leaves not discarded, but even the roots are pickled into pickles; children as young as three or four years old know how to eat every grain of rice in their bowls; and during the autumn harvest, every grain of grain that falls on the ground is picked up. We realized that only those who labor understand the meaning of frugality the most. Compared with the living conditions in the organs, we really feel ashamed. Live wells cannot be dug here, and the water for drinking and use is all rainwater that has been accumulated. The water for the whole village is stored in an open-air pond. When we first arrived, this was the biggest threat to us who were used to tap water. When we saw the villagers cherishing water so much, and after we carried a few loads of water, we also learned to cherish water, using one or two bowls of water per person per day to wash our faces, leaving the water to wash our hands after returning from work, and then using it to mix coal. Therefore, we deeply realized that it is really necessary for people like us who have never been to the countryside since childhood and have been pampered in the city to go to a difficult environment to train and transform ourselves.
    We are determined to continue to train and transform ourselves through labor and not bow our heads to any difficulties. In order to live up to the expectations of the Party and the masses, we will ensure that we do the following in the upcoming winter and spring production and democracy upsurges and in our future lives:
    1. Go all out, and in the five-month agricultural production upsurge this winter and spring, march towards nature together with all the cooperative members with the spirit of splitting mountains and overturning seas, and the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains. Ensure that male comrades work 130 days in five months, striving to work 120 labor days, and female comrades work 120 days, striving to work 70 labor days. Humbly learn production techniques and gradually improve our labor ability.
    2. Actively participate in the socialist ideological education movement to be educated ourselves. Learn work experience from grassroots cadres, and do some work within our capabilities without excessively affecting labor.
    3. Further improve relations with the households we live with, so that they regard us as members of their own families. Use our spare time to help the households grind grain, carry water, and sweep the yard. At the same time, we must contact more cooperative members and learn from the excellent qualities of the people in the mountainous areas of loving the Party, loving the collective, being diligent and brave, and being hardworking and simple.
    4. Continue to eat and live with the villagers, and never be special in any way. Do not cook or buy things to eat ourselves. Except for expenses such as subscribing to newspapers, our living expenses will not exceed the level of middle peasants.

　　他们八个人
    11月27日的人民日报上，登载了团中央的八个下放干部在山西省平顺县红星、五一农业社被评为优秀社员的新闻，很多读者都关心他们的劳动和生活情况，下面是这八位同志最近的来信。编辑同志：
    我们八个人，响应了党的号召，于
  9月30日来到了太行山上的一个村庄——扬威乡，被分配在红星、五一两个农业社六个生产队里参加劳动。
    在这两个多月中，我们受到了这儿党、政组织和群众热烈的欢迎和无微不至的照顾。最使我们难忘的是：我们来到这儿那天，天已黑了，老乡们劳动了一天，晚饭也没吃，男女老少五、六百人，敲锣打鼓出村二、三里去迎接我们；当我们第一次劳动把手磨破了的时候，社员们比磨破了自己的手还心疼，见面就问手好了没有；特别是最近两社又把我们评为优秀社员，更使我们心情不安，感到当之有愧，我们还没取得农民资格，怎么够得上优秀社员呢？这一切都鼓舞着我们的劳动热情和克服困难的决心。我们知道，群众所以对我们这样的欢迎、关怀和鼓舞，是因为他们热爱党。正如宋进群老大爷所说的：“党没有忘记山区人民，今天还派干部来和我们同吃、同住、同劳动，毛主席真是英明伟大。”
    我们参加了秋收，秋耕，农田水利基本建设，植树造林和积肥等劳动。通过这些劳动，改变了下来前认为农业生产简单，有力气就行的错误看法，同时也提高了劳动能力。当第一次割谷时，虽然生产队派了有经验的老农教我们如何握刀、抓谷、下刀等基本动作，但动手一干，镰刀说什么也不听使唤，不仅达不到抓穗割、留茬低的质量要求，而且累得满头大汗，不到半小时就把手磨了许多大泡。有一次我们和社员一同去刨萝卜，心里想这事简单，用镢刨出来就行了，可是动手一刨，把许多萝卜都刨坏了。甚至连往缸里倒水的简单事我们也不会，不但不能像老乡们那样不放下扁担往里倒，就是把扁担放下用两手提一桶水倒，还溅的满地是水。至于担百来斤重的两捆谷走上五、六里山路，中间不能休息的话，我们连试也没敢试。可笑的是，我们空着手在后边跟着走，还怕跌到山沟里，有时手还得帮脚的忙。同志们感叹地说，真是什么都得学，连走路也得学。初来时，不用说干活，每天上地爬五、六里山路，已经累得喘不上气来，劳动一天回来后，感到精疲力尽，腰酸腿疼。但我们没有向困难低头，不会的就虚心向农民学习，体力不够就咬紧牙关锻炼。现在我们体力大大增强了，百来斤重的担子，已能连续担上半天了。最近我们到县里去开会，走了四十里山路，一点没感到累，同志们开玩笑的说，回北京后，星期天进城再不用坐公共汽车了。我们深深体会到，在劳动中锻炼改造自己，对有毅力的人不是什么困难的事；但对意志薄弱的人来说也不是一件容易的事。劳动对有了劳动习惯的劳动人民是件愉快的事；但对没有劳动习惯的知识分子来说，也的确是个艰苦的过程。
    群众艰苦朴素的优良品质是值得我们学习的。如粮食本来够吃，但一般还要掺些糠菜；吃洋白菜时，不仅外边的老叶不丢掉，而且连菜根也腌成咸菜吃；三、四岁的小孩也懂得把碗里的饭吃的一粒不剩；秋收时把掉在地里的粮食，都一粒粒的拾回来。我们体会到只有劳动的人才最懂得节约的意义。和机关的生活情况对比，我们真是感到惭愧。这儿打不出活水井，吃的用的都是积存起来的雨水，全村的用水都积存在一个露天大水池里。初来时，对我们这些用惯自来水的人是个最大的威胁，当我们看到老乡们那样珍惜用水，在我们担了几担水之后，也懂得爱惜用水了，每天两个人用一、两碗水洗脸，洗后留下劳动回来洗手，然后再用它合煤。从而我们深深体会到，像我们这些从小没有到过农村，在城市里养娇了的人，实在有到艰苦环境中锻炼改造的必要。
    我们决心继续在劳动中锻炼和改造自己，不向任何困难低头。为了不辜负党和群众对我们的期待，保证在今冬明春生产、民主两大高潮和今后生活中，作到如下几点：
    一、鼓足劲头，在今冬明春五个月的农业生产高潮中，以劈山倒海、愚公移山的精神，和全体社员一起向大自然进军。保证在五个月中，男同志出勤一百三十天，争取做到一百二十个劳动日，女同志出勤一百二十天，争取做到七十个劳动日；虚心学习生产技术，逐步提高劳动能力。
    二、积极参加社会主义思想教育运动，使自己受到教育；向基层干部学习工作经验，在不过多影响劳动的情况下，主动做一些力能胜任的工作。
    三、进一步和住户搞好关系，使他们把我们看成是自己家里的人，利用劳动空闲时间，帮助住户推碾、担水、扫院子；同时要与更多社员联系，学习山区人民热爱党、热爱集体、勤劳勇敢、艰苦朴素的优良品质。
    四、继续和老乡们同吃同住，一切绝不特殊，不自己做或买东西吃，除订报等费用外，生活不超过中农水平。
