    A Poem Distorting "Hundred Schools of Thought Contending": A Critique of "Record of Ninety-Nine Schools Contending"
    Dai Bojian
    I believe that "Record of Ninety-Nine Schools Contending," written by Mu Dan and published on page eight of the People's Daily on May 7th of this year, is a bad poem. Although the author used obscure writing, it cannot conceal the distrust and dissatisfaction it reveals towards the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and the Rectification Movement.
    Early May was shortly after the Party issued the directive on the Rectification Movement, instructing that "rectification" be carried out throughout the Party and that "contention" and "blooming" be further developed. However, the author used deception to "criticize" certain people for not "contending" or "blooming" freely, and secretly attacked the Rectification Movement. It was as if telling people that the Communist Party was not determined to carry out rectification, and that "contention" was merely a formality, "like rain on dry ground." The title of the poem is "Record of Ninety-Nine Schools Contending," implying that "contention" only involved "ninety-nine schools," a group of people, while those who should truly be contending were "little soldiers" excluded from the "ninety-nine schools." Therefore, in the author's pen, "contention" becomes such a scene: this one is "without insight," that one is "half true and half false," but the Chairman gives these people "awards" and "support." Apart from this, there is only the "echoing," "fake advancing," and "inseparable" "battle of words." People want to ask why "contention" is so dull? The author says it is because the "Chairman" who "only waits to draw conclusions" seems redundant, and he stubbornly insists on his own way and controls the meeting. "If someone unfortunately mentions a fact that is clearly different from the authoritative opinion," then although it has been stated "do not label," it is still pointed out that "Comrade so-and-so has a problem with their position." After the author's distortion, the so-called "contention" is, of course, a deceptive guise.
    The scene the author has drawn for "Hundred Schools of Thought Contending" is clear at a glance. Through this portrayal of the "contention" meeting, what people see is a suppressed political life, lack of freedom of speech, and the ability to only speak opinions that are consistent with "authority." But, does this have anything to do with the Party's policy of "Hundred Schools of Thought Contending"? Isn't this a deliberately crafted picture distorting reality? Why are those who agree with the leaders all "echoes"? Why are those who speak of "principles" all "fake advancing"? We must also ask the author, what kind of people are those "little soldiers who do not contend" that you are referring to? What truths and facts have you and they been "suppressed" from speaking? What truths and facts do you have that cannot see the light of day in our socialist society? "Record of Ninety-Nine Schools Contending" was published when right-wing elements were launching a large-scale attack against the Party under the guise of airing their views, which cannot but make one suspect the author's true motives.

### 一首歪曲“百家争鸣”的诗  对“九十九家争鸣记”的批评

    一首歪曲“百家争鸣”的诗
    对“九十九家争鸣记”的批评
    戴伯健
    今年5月7日人民日报八版上刊登的穆旦所写的“九十九家争鸣记”，我认为是一首不好的诗。作者尽管用了隐晦的笔法，但是也不能掩饰它所流露出来的对党的“百家争鸣、百花齐放”的方针和整风运动的不信任和不满。
    5月上旬，正是党发表整风指示不久，指示在全党范围内进行“整风”，进一步开展“争鸣”和“齐放”。可是作者却鱼目混珠地借“批评”某些人不敢放手“鸣”、“放”，对整风运动暗施冷箭。像是在告诉人们：共产党整风并无决心，“争鸣”只不过走走形式，“雨过地皮湿”。诗的题目是“九十九家争鸣记”，暗示“争鸣”只是“九十九家”，是一伙子人，而真正应该鸣的，却是被排斥在“九十九家”之外的“小卒”。因此，在作者的笔下“争鸣”就变成这样的情景：这个“毫无见识”，那个“半真半假”，但主席却给这些人以“奖励”和“支持”。除此而外，就剩下“应声虫”、“假前进”的“难分难解”的“舌战”。人们要问为什么“争鸣”这样沉闷？作者说就是因为那个“单等作结论的”看起来是多余的“主席”，他一意孤行，把持会议。“有谁不幸提到一个事实，和权威意见显然不同”，于是虽然表白过“不要扣帽子”，但是还是指出了“某同志立场很有问题”。经过作者这样的丑化，所谓“争鸣”，当然是一个骗人的幌子了。
    作者为“百家争鸣”勾画的情景，是一目了然的。通过这次“争鸣”会的写照，人们看到的，是受压抑的政治生活，言论不自由，只能讲与“威权”一致的意见。可是，这难道与党“百家争鸣”方针有半点相干吗？这难道不是作者别有用心地制造出来的一幅歪曲现实的图画吗？为什么同领导人意见一致的人都是“应声虫”呢？为什么说“原则”话的人都是“假前进”呢？我们还要问作者，你究竟所指的那些“不鸣的小卒”又是什么样的人？你和他们究竟被“压抑”了哪些话不能说出来？究竟你们有什么真理与事实，不能够在我们的社会主义社会里见天日呢？“九十九家争鸣记”发表的时候，正是右派分子在鸣放的幌子下向党大肆进攻的时候，这就不能不令人怀疑作者的真实动机了。
