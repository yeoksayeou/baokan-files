Xinhua News Agency, December 8th dispatch: According to TASS, New York, December 7th: U.S. Vice President Nixon stated on the evening of December 6th at the U.S. National Association of Manufacturers convention that America's military budget will significantly increase next year, and taxes will absolutely not be lowered. He also said that if a balanced budget cannot guarantee the necessary amount for military purposes, the U.S. will not hesitate to run a budget deficit to cope with military expenditures.

Nixon acknowledged the historical victory of Soviet science and technology. He said, "Many Americans in the past predicted with a strange confidence that we would naturally and forever be in the leading position in terms of economic progress, military power, and scientific invention. But two satellites tell us that this was not the case in the past, and it will not be the case in the future."

In view of the great appeal of the idea of peaceful coexistence to the American people, Nixon mentioned a statement by Khrushchev: The capitalist world and the socialist world should engage in peaceful competition. Nixon said, "All Americans would welcome an even broader peaceful competition than Mr. Khrushchev advocates." He boasted that they would compete in "the entire field of human aspirations."

But he then used his own fabricated so-called "dangers" to intimidate the participants of the convention. He said that the "total danger" threatening the United States is "enormous," and that this "danger" is a "war composed of many aspects such as military, political, economic, and psychological," a "total war" that requires the United States to "make a full determination."

　　尼克松黯然承认美国不成
　　但又拼命鼓吹搞军事竞赛
    据新华社8日讯　据塔斯社纽约7日讯：美国副总统尼克松6日晚间在美国全国制造商协会代表大会上说，明年美国的军事预算将大大增加，捐税绝对不会降低。他又说，如果预算平衡保证不了军事目的的必需数额，美国将不惜以预算出现赤字来应付军事开支。
    尼克松承认苏联科学技术的历史性胜利。他说：“许许多多美国人在过去以一种古怪的信心预言：我们在经济进步、军事威力和科学发明等方面自然而然地将永远居于首位。而两个卫星告诉我们，过去不是这样，将来也不会是这样。”
    鉴于和平共处思想对美国人有很大的吸引力，尼克松提到赫鲁晓夫说的一句话：资本主义世界和社会主义世界应该进行和平竞赛。尼克松说：“全体美国人会欢迎比赫鲁晓夫先生主张的更加广泛的和平竞赛。”他吹嘘要在“人类的愿望的整个领域中竞赛”。
    但是他接着又用他自己捏造的所谓“危险”来恫吓代表大会的参加者。他说，威胁美国的“总的危险是巨大的”，这种“危险”是“由军事、政治、经济、心理等许多方面构成的战争”，是需要美国“下定全部决心的总体战争”。
