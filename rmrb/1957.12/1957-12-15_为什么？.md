Why?

    Why does a candle flame go out with a puff, while a stove fire burns even stronger when fanned?

    When a candle burns, it is mainly because the wick absorbs the melted wax oil, vaporizing it into steam, which then comes into contact with the air and burns. When wind blows, the melted wax vaporizes rapidly. This vaporization absorbs heat from the surroundings, causing the unmelted wax to cool down quickly. At the same time, the wind blowing on the candle's wick causes the flame to sway, preventing it from continuing to raise the temperature of the wax around it. As a result, the wax solidifies. Once the wax solidifies, it means that there is no more wax oil to supply the wick for continued absorption, so the candle flame goes out.

    Household stoves use coal or wood as fuel. These fuels do not volatilize faster due to wind, so they do not extinguish like candles. On the contrary, fanning the flames causes the air to flow faster, providing more oxygen to the stove. The carbon dioxide and water vapor left over from burning in the stove are more easily removed, so the fire burns even stronger when fanned.

    Why can you add almost a full bowl of soup to a bowl of rice when you put the rice in first and then add the soup, but you can only add a little rice if you put the soup in first and then add the rice?

    Originally, there is a lot of air trapped inside the rice grains. If you put the rice in first and then pour in the soup, the soup rises gradually from the bottom of the bowl, expelling a large amount of air, so a lot of soup can be added. If you put the soup in first and then add the rice grains, the water immediately surrounds the rice grains, preventing the air from escaping, so not much rice can be added, and the soup in the bowl will overflow.

    Why does an aluminum pot become dull and grey over time?

    This is because the aluminum pot comes into long-term contact with oxygen in the air, and a layer of opaque aluminum oxide film forms on the surface. The bright, white aluminum pot will then turn grey. If you scrub it with alkaline water or ash water, the aluminum oxide can be removed, and the aluminum pot can return to its original luster. This is because alkali and ash are alkaline in water and can dissolve the aluminum oxide film. However, we should not frequently scrub aluminum pots with alkaline water or ash water, because although the aluminum oxide film appears dull and unsightly, it is very strong and can prevent further oxidation of the aluminum inside. If you keep scrubbing it, the aluminum pot will continue to oxidize, and therefore be more easily damaged. (Hong)

    Why is stir-fried salt less prone to moisture absorption and has less of a bitter taste?

    Salt is not bitter and does not absorb moisture. These annoying characteristics are due to its closest companion - magnesium chloride. Table salt is made of sodium chloride, which also contains a lot of magnesium chloride. This is like putting sugar in fried rice noodles, people always say: "These fried rice noodles are sweet." In fact, the fried rice noodles themselves are not sweet, but because sugar is added. However, chemists are the most impartial witnesses, they cleared salt of this injustice and told people that magnesium chloride will collapse when heated. How does it collapse? Magnesium chloride turns into hydrogen chloride and magnesium oxide when heated. Hydrogen chloride is a gas and is immediately released. Magnesium oxide is a white powder that is not easily soluble in water, so it does not taste bitter. (Mingfen)

专栏：为什么？

　　为什么？
    为什么烛火一吹就灭，而炉火却愈扇愈旺？
    蜡烛燃烧，主要是由于灯芯吸收熔化了的蜡油，把蜡油挥发成蒸汽，这些蒸汽与空气接触，就燃烧起来。当风吹来时，熔化了的蜡就迅速挥发；而蜡的挥发，又吸收了周围的热量，使还没有来得及挥发的那部分熔蜡很快冷却下来。同时，由于风吹在蜡烛的灯芯上，使烛火摇摆不定，不能继续提高烛火周围蜡的温度，因此蜡就冷凝起来了；蜡一冷凝，也就等于再没有蜡油可以供给灯芯继续吸收，所以烛火熄灭。
    家用的炉子，用的燃料是煤块或木柴。这些燃料并不会因为有风而加快它的挥发，当然也就不会像蜡烛那样熄灭。相反，用扇子扇动，会使空气流动得更快，供给炉子的氧气更多，炉内烧剩下来的二氧化碳和水汽更易被赶掉，因此炉火是愈扇愈旺。
                                （其）
    为什么先盛饭后加汤，一碗饭几乎可以加进去一碗汤；若是先盛汤后加饭，能加进去的饭却很少？
    原来，在饭块内有很多的空气藏着。若是先盛饭后倒汤，则汤由碗底逐渐升起，将大量空气排出，所以能装入很多汤。若是先装好汤，后放入饭块，则水马上包围了饭块，使空气跑不出来，因而装不了多少饭，碗内的汤就要漫出来了。（周宏兴）
    为什么铝锅放久了会变得颜色灰暗？
    这是由于铝锅在空气中与氧气长期接触，外表生了一层不透明的氧化铝薄膜，洁白光亮的铝锅就会变成灰暗色。假如用碱水或炉灰水擦洗，氧化铝就可除去，铝锅又能回复原来的光泽。因为碱和炉灰在水中都具有硷性，能把氧化铝薄膜溶去。不过，我们不应经常用硷水或炉灰水去擦洗铝锅，因为氧化铝薄膜虽然显得灰暗不好看，但却十分坚固，能够防止内部铝的继续氧化。如果不断擦洗，铝锅就会不断地氧化，因此也就更易损坏了。　（洪）
    炒过的食盐为什么不易还潮而且苦味也减少？
    盐本来是不苦的，也不会还潮。这些被人讨厌的性格，都是它的最亲密的同伴——氯化镁的罪恶。食盐的成份是氯化钠，其中也含有很多氯化镁。这就像炒米粉拌了糖一样，人家总是说：“这炒米粉是甜的。”其实炒米粉本身并不甜，而是放了糖的缘故。可是化学家是最公平的证人，他们把盐受的这份冤枉给澄清了，并且告诉人们氯化镁在加热后就要垮台的。它怎样垮台呢？氯化镁加热就变成氯化氢和氧化镁。氯化氢是气体，随即放出；氧化镁是白色粉末，这种粉末不易溶于水，所以吃起来也不感到苦。　（鸣芬）
