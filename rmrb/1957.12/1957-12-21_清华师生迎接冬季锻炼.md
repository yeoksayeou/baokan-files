Tsinghua University Faculty and Students Welcome Winter Exercise

    (Our report) To actively promote winter physical exercise, the Student Union of Tsinghua University recently held a school-wide meeting of student sports cadres. President Jiang Nanxiang and Professor Ma John both spoke at the meeting.

    Jiang Nanxiang said at the meeting that we are running a socialist university, and we must cultivate young people to become talents with socialist consciousness and mastery of their profession. At the same time, they must also be physically fit and able to work, socialist builders.

    Jiang Nanxiang encouraged everyone to actively participate in exercise. He said that every student should strive to work for the motherland for fifty years after graduation. Old age is the season of harvest. The older you get, the richer your knowledge and experience will be. But if you want to harvest in old age, you must sow in your youth. Therefore, everyone should actively participate in physical exercise. Tsinghua University has very experienced sports instructors, a relatively long and good sports tradition, and the equipment is not bad. Therefore, Tsinghua University is fully capable of carrying out physical exercise.

    Professor Ma John, based on his own personal experience, pointed out the importance of carrying out physical exercise to the students at the meeting.

    清华师生迎接冬季锻炼
    本报讯  为了积极开展冬季体育锻炼，清华大学学生会最近召开了全校学生体育干部大会。蒋南翔校长和马约翰教授都在会上讲了话。
    蒋南翔在会上说，我们办的是社会主义大学，要培养青年成为具有社会主义觉悟、掌握业务的人材，同时还必须是体魄健全的、能劳动的社会主义建设者。
  蒋南翔鼓励大家踊跃参加锻炼。他说，每个同学都要争取在毕业后为祖国工作五十年。老年是丰收的季节，年纪越大，知识、经验也就越丰富，但要想在老年丰收，就必须在青年时代播种，所以，大家要积极参加体育锻炼。清华大学有很有经验的体育指导，有比较悠久和良好的体育传统，设备也不差，因此清华大学完全有条件把体育锻炼开展起来。
    马约翰教授在会上，以他自己的亲身体会，向同学指出了开展体育锻炼的重要性。
