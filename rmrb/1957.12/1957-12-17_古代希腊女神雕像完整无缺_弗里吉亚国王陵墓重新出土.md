　　An ancient Greek goddess marble statue dating back more than 1,700 years was recently unearthed in farmland near Erez, not far from Gaza.

　　The statue is of a mythical creature with the torso and feet of a lion, and the wings and beak of a griffin. When unearthed, the statue was almost undamaged, with the lion's torso, snake tail, and wings all intact. At the goddess's feet was a wheel of fortune.

　　In central Italy, some ancient steles from the Etruscan kingdom (before the Roman Empire) dating back more than 2,000 years have been discovered in the past, and for generations, archaeologists have been unable to decipher the enigmatic inscriptions on the steles. Recently, Professor Glori of Italy announced that he has developed a method for deciphering them. He first uses a mathematical rule to identify the numbers in the inscription, then applies this rule to the mysterious Etruscan letters. He says he can use this method to translate the inscriptions on a monument.

　　Not long ago, near Gordium in Turkey, a group of archaeologists opened the large tomb believed to be that of Gordius, one of the most accomplished kings of the ancient Phrygian Empire.

　　About 2,700 years ago, Phrygia, ruled by Gordius, was the largest empire in Asia Minor. However, during the reign of his son Midas, the Phrygians were ravaged by the Cimmerians. Midas, in shame, is said to have committed suicide by drinking bull's blood.

　　From the tomb were not only discovered the remains of King Gordius, but also three bronze pots of high artistic skill, and other items.

### 古代希腊女神雕像完整无缺  弗里吉亚国王陵墓重新出土

　　古代希腊女神雕像完整无缺  弗里吉亚国王陵墓重新出土
    离加沙不远的埃雷兹附近耕地上，最近发掘出一个一千七百多年前的希腊女神的大理石雕像。
    这个石像是神话中躯干和足像狮子而羽翼和嘴像鹰鹫的雌性怪兽。掘出时，石像几乎毫无损毁，狮子的躯干、蛇尾和翅膀都很完整。女神的足下还有个命运的轮盘。
    过去在意大利中部发现了一些二千多年前（罗马帝国以前）的伊特鲁里亚古国的古碑，若干世代以来考古学家都无法辨认碑上像谜一样的碑文。最近意大利的格洛里教授宣布研究出一种辨认的方法。他首先以一种数学规律来辨认碑文的数字。然后把这个规律应用于伊特鲁里亚神秘的字母。他说，他用这种方法能把一块纪念碑上的碑文翻译出来。
    不久前在土耳其戈尔迪乌姆附近，一批考古学家掘开了据说是古代弗里吉亚帝国最有作为的国王之一戈尔迪乌斯的大坟窟。
    大约二千七百年前，戈尔迪乌斯统治的弗里吉亚是小亚细亚最大的帝国。但是，他儿子米达斯在位时，弗里吉亚人遭到麦里亚人的蹂躏。米达斯羞愧之下，据说喝牛血自杀。
    这次从墓中不仅发现了戈尔迪乌斯王的遗骸，而且还发现了有很高艺术技巧的三件青铜锅等。
