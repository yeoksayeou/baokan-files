　　Good Conditions and Bad Conditions

　　Leading the production struggle, like conducting other struggles, requires a good analysis of both subjective and objective conditions. How to utilize various conditions to maximize production effectiveness is greatly related to the leader's ideological understanding and subjective efforts.

　　Huangyan, where natural conditions are not very good, has achieved a much greater increase in production than Pingyang County, which has better natural conditions, because the local leaders exerted subjective efforts. Funing County, Hebei Province, does not have good natural environment and production conditions, but it reached the 400-jin target required by the National Agricultural Development Program ten years ahead of schedule this year. Some counties with natural conditions no worse than theirs have not yet reached it.

　　Recent inspections of production achievements in various regions over the two years since cooperativization have provided many such facts: some areas with poor natural conditions and backward production have made leaps and bounds in production due to great enthusiasm. They have surpassed some areas with superior natural conditions and higher original production levels, not only in terms of growth rate but also in terms of unit yield.

　　Those who emphasize objective conditions while neglecting subjective efforts always have various reasons. Some, whose objective conditions are already quite good, still complain and attribute the slow increase or decrease in production in their areas to objective conditions. Because they cannot see the favorable aspects of the objective conditions, they cling to the unfavorable aspects and exaggerate them, considering these unfavorable factors to be unchangeable.

　　Others are complacent because they possess superior conditions. They believe they are "blessed by nature" and can stay ahead of others by following the usual routine, but the result is that they fall far behind. Conversely, some areas with poor natural conditions are unwilling to lag behind. They fight against poor mountains and bad waters with revolutionary spirit and achieve victory as a result.

　　"Under certain conditions, bad things can lead to good results, and good things can also lead to bad results." Today, as we plan for future production, isn't Chairman Mao's famous saying above worth pondering repeatedly?

### 好条件与坏条件

    好条件与坏条件
    领导生产斗争同进行其他斗争一样，要善于分析主客观各方面的条件。而如何运用各种条件，使它能发挥增产的效能，却同领导者的思想认识和主观努力有极大关系。
    自然条件并不很好的黄岩，由于当地领导者发挥了主观的努力，因而增产效果就大大超过了自然条件比他们好的平阳县。河北省抚宁县自然环境和生产条件并不好，却在今年提前十年达到了全国农业发展纲要要求的四百斤指标。而一些自然条件不比他们坏的县份，却还没有达到。
    在最近各地检阅合作化后两年来的生产成绩当中，提供了不少这样的事实：一些自然条件不好、生产落后的地区，由于干劲大生产上有了跃进式的发展，它们不但在增产速度上、而且在单位产量水平上，把一些自然条件优越、原来生产水平较高的地区远远抛在后面。
    好强调客观条件而忽视主观的努力的人，总有各种理由。有些自己的客观条件本来已经是相当不错了，却还要怨天尤人，把自己地区增产缓慢或减产的原因，归咎于客观条件。这种人因为看不见客观条件中的有利方面，就死抓住客观条件中的不利方面大事夸张，而且把这些不利的因素看得是无法改的。
    另有些人因为自己握有优越条件而自满。以为自己“得天独厚”只要按部就班地迈脚步，就可以走在别人的前面，可是结果却远远地落在人家的后面。相反地，一些自然条件坏的地区，却不甘落后，他们以革命精神，同穷山恶水奋战，结果就取得了胜利。
    “在一定的条件下，坏的东西可以引出好的结果，好的东西也可以引出坏的结果。”今天，当我们规划未来的生产的时候，毛主席的上面这句名言，难到不值得我们反复玩味吗？
