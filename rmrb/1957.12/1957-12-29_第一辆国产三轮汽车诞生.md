The first domestically produced three-wheeled vehicle was test-driven on the streets of Shanghai on the 28th. This three-wheeled vehicle, made entirely from domestically produced materials, was produced through the collaboration of the Shanghai Internal Combustion Engine Electrical Appliance Factory, the Shanghai Automobile Chassis Factory, and the Shanghai Automobile Decoration Factory, with the cooperation of many smaller factories.

This vehicle was designed independently by absorbing the advantages of various automobiles and combining them with the specific transportation conditions in China. It is small, light, quick, and flexible, and can carry a load of one ton. It is equipped with a new 30-horsepower gasoline engine that consumes little fuel, costing only three cents per kilometer in fuel expenses. The vehicle is also equipped with special shock absorbers, allowing it to travel on rough roads. During the test drive on the 28th, the vehicle was driven at full power, running very smoothly without any swaying. The day before the official test drive, the vehicle underwent a climbing test. Carrying twenty-one people, it successfully climbed from the ground floor of the assembly plant along a fifteen-degree slope to the top of the third floor.

    第一辆国产三轮汽车诞生
    本报上海28日电　第一辆国产三轮汽车，28日在上海马路上试车。这辆完全采用国产原料制成的三轮汽车，是由上海内燃机配电厂、上海汽车底盘厂、上海汽车装修厂三家工厂为主，组织许多小工厂协作制成的。
    这辆汽车是吸收多种汽车的优点，结合我国交通运输的具体情况自行设计的，小巧、轻快、灵活，能载重一吨。车上装有三十匹马力的新型汽油发动机，耗油少，每公里的燃料费用只要三分钱。车上还装有特别的避震器，能在崎岖不平的道路上行驶。在28日试车的时候，车子开足了马力，走得很稳健，一点也不摇摆。正式试车的前一天，这辆汽车曾经作了一次爬坡试验。它载着二十一个人，从装车厂的底层，沿着十五度的坡道顺利地爬上了三层楼顶。
