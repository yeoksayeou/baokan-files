Xinhua News Agency dispatches: Since launching the competition to catch up with the United States in per capita production of meat, milk, and oils in recent years, the Soviet Union has made significant achievements in this regard.
    Soviet milk production is not only likely to catch up with the United States in per capita production in 1958, but may also exceed it.
    In 1956, the total milk production in the Soviet Union reached 49.2 million tons, an increase of 13.9 million tons compared to 1950; while the total milk production in the United States in 1956 was 57.7 million tons, only an increase of 4.5 million tons compared to 1950. On a per capita basis, milk production in the Soviet Union increased by 26% during this period, while in the United States it decreased by 2%. In the first half of this year, milk production in Soviet collective farms and state farms increased by 26% compared to the same period last year, and by one and a half times compared to the first half of 1953. At this rate of growth, it is expected that the total milk production in the Soviet Union this year will exceed that of the United States. Currently, three Soviet republics already have milk production that significantly exceeds that of the United States on a per capita basis.
    The rapid increase in total milk production in the Soviet Union is the result of the increase in the number of dairy cows and the continuous increase in milk yield per cow in recent years. Last year, the number of dairy cows in the Soviet Union increased by approximately five million compared to 1953, and in the first half of this year, it increased by 6% compared to the same period last year. In the first half of this year, the average milk yield per cow in Soviet collective farms and state farms almost doubled compared to the first half of 1953.
    Many regions in the Soviet Union are also successfully fulfilling their guarantees to catch up with the United States in per capita production of major livestock products in recent years. Many collective farms have already completed their guarantees for meat and milk production ahead of schedule this year.
    The Soviet Union's targets for catching up with the United States in meat and milk are to produce an average of 42 quintals of meat (net weight) and 141 quintals of milk per 100 hectares of agricultural land.
    Since launching the competition to catch up with the United States in per capita production of meat, milk, and oils in recent years, many regions in the Soviet Union have achieved significant successes. Collective farms in the Kreyzhopol District of Vinnytsia Oblast produced 101 quintals of meat per 100 hectares of agricultural land in the first ten months of this year, equivalent to two and a half times the total for last year. Collective farms in the Chadyr-Lunga District of the Moldavian Republic produced 66.6 quintals of meat per 100 hectares of land in the first ten months of this year, while the total for last year was only 34 quintals. Collective farms and state farms in the Lithuanian Republic produced 54% more milk in the first eight months of this year than in the same period last year, and the Belorussian Republic increased by 43%.
    The Kirov Collective Farm in the Chadyr-Lunga District originally guaranteed to produce 110 quintals of meat per 100 hectares of land in 1957, but it produced 115.5 quintals in the first ten months of this year. This collective farm only produced 40.9 quintals of meat per 100 hectares of land last year, and only about 20 quintals in 1955. This farm recently reconsidered its potential and decided to raise its guarantee for next year to 150 quintals of meat per 100 hectares of land.
    The Zhdanov Collective Farm in Kyiv Oblast produced 102.1 quintals of meat and 393.7 quintals of milk per 100 hectares of agricultural land in the first ten months of this year. The farm's guarantees for this year are 100 quintals of meat and 400 quintals of milk, respectively. In the first ten months of this year, the farm's meat production increased by 1.3 times compared to the same period last year, and milk production increased by 90%.
    The Budyonny Collective Farm in Odessa Oblast produced more than 120 quintals of meat per 100 hectares of agricultural land in the first nine and a half months of this year, exceeding the full-year guarantee. This farm is expected to produce 200 quintals of meat per 100 hectares of agricultural land by the end of this year.

### 苏联出现赶上美国的竞赛高潮　牛奶产量按人口计算明年可能超过美国

　　苏联出现赶上美国的竞赛高潮
　　牛奶产量按人口计算明年可能超过美国
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：自从展开争取在最近几年内在按人口计算肉类、牛奶和油脂的生产方面赶上美国的竞赛以后，苏联在这方面已经取得了显著的成就。
    苏联的牛奶生产不仅有可能在1958年在按人口平均计算的产量方面赶上美国，而且还可能超过美国。
    1956年苏联牛奶总产量达到了四千九百二十万吨，比1950年增加了一千三百九十万吨；而美国在1956年牛奶总产量是五千七百七十万吨，只比1950年增加四百五十万吨。按人口平均计算，苏联在这个期间牛奶产量增加了26％，而美国却下降了2％。今年上半年，苏联集体农庄和国营农场的牛奶产量比去年同期增加了26％，比1953年上半年增加了一倍半。按照这种增长速度，预料苏联今年牛奶的总产量将超过美国。现在，苏联已经有三个加盟共和国的牛奶产量按人口平均计算大大超过了美国。
    苏联牛奶总产量的迅速增加是由于最近几年来奶牛头数的增长和每头奶牛的挤奶量不断提高的结果。去年苏联的奶牛比1953年增加了约五百万头，今年上半年又比去年同期增加了6％。今年上半年，苏联集体农庄和国营农场每头奶牛的平均挤奶量几乎比1953年上半年增加了一倍。
    苏联许多地区也正在顺利地完成在最近几年内在按人口平均计算的主要畜产品产量方面赶上美国的保证。已经有许多集体农庄在肉类和奶类生产上提前完成了今年的保证。
    苏联在肉类和牛奶方面赶上美国的指标是在每一百公顷农业用地上平均生产四十二公担肉类（净重）和一百四十一公担牛奶。
    自从展开争取在最近几年内在按人口计算肉类、牛奶和油脂的生产方面赶上美国的竞赛以后，苏联许多地区取得了显著的成就。文尼萨州克雷饶波尔区的集体农庄在今年头十个月内，在每一百公顷农业用地上生产了一百零一公担肉类，相当于去年全年的两倍半。摩尔达维亚共和国的恰迪尔—伦格区的集体农庄今年头十个月在每一百公顷土地上生产了六十六点六公担肉类，而去年全年只有三十四公担。立陶宛共和国的集体农庄和国营农庄今年头八个月生产的牛奶比去年同期增加了54％，白俄罗斯共和国增加了43％。
    恰迪尔—伦格区的基洛夫集体农庄原来保证在1957年在每一百公顷土地上生产一百一十公担肉类，但是它在今年头十个月内就生产了一百一十五点五公担。而这个集体农庄去年每一百公顷土地只生产了四十点九公担肉类，1955年只生产了二十公担左右。这个农庄最近重新考虑了自己的潜力，决定把明年的保证提高到每一百公顷土地生产一百五十公担肉类。
    基辅州日丹诺夫集体农庄今年头十个月每一百公顷农业用地生产了一百零二点一公担肉类、三百九十三点七公担牛奶，这个农庄今年的保证分别是一百公担肉类和四百公担牛奶。今年头十个月，这个农庄的肉类产量比去年同期增加了一点三倍，牛奶产量增加了90％。
    敖德萨州布琼尼集体农庄今年头九个半月在每一百公顷农业用地上生产了一百二十公担以上的肉类，超额完成了今年全年的保证。这个农庄到今年年底每一百公顷农业用地预计将生产二百公担肉类。
