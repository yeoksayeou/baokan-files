Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 2nd. All Indonesian workers employed in Dutch enterprises throughout Indonesia today held a twenty-four-hour general strike to express their determination to recover West Irian.

In Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, Dutch banks, the Royal Dutch Shipping Company, the offices of the five major Dutch trading houses, and all Dutch enterprises and shops, large and small, were closed today. Indonesian workers raised red flags in front of the gates of these Dutch enterprises, indicating that the strike was underway.

The strike was conducted in an orderly manner. Some workers stayed in the enterprises to prevent acts of sabotage.

Today, no Dutch-language newspapers were published in Jakarta. All eight Dutch-language daily newspapers in Indonesia have been banned from publication. The Indonesian Minister of Information has announced, based on the decision of the Cabinet meeting on December 1st, that all Dutch-language newspapers and periodicals are prohibited from publication and circulation in Indonesia. All films with Dutch-language explanations are prohibited from being shown. This decision has already been implemented.

The Minister of Information also announced that, starting from December 2nd, Royal Dutch Airlines aircraft will not be allowed to land or stay in Indonesia. All of the company's aircraft in Indonesia have been ordered to leave Indonesia as soon as possible.

This series of measures taken against Dutch enterprises was adopted at yesterday's Cabinet meeting. The Indonesian government had previously announced that if the West Irian issue is not resolved in the United Nations, the Indonesian government would take further action.

The National Committee of the All-Indonesian Central Trade Union Organization has sent a telegram to the World Federation of Trade Unions, requesting trade unions in all countries to boycott Dutch sea and air transport around the world.

    印度尼西亚人民决心收复西伊里安
　  荷兰企业雇用工人总罢工
    雅加达的荷兰公司和商店都紧闭了门窗
    新华社雅加达2日电　在印度尼西亚全国各地的荷兰企业中工作的全部印度尼西亚工人今天举行二十四小时总罢工，以表示他们要收回西伊里安的决心。
    在印度尼西亚首都雅加达，荷兰的银行、荷兰皇家轮船公司、荷兰五大洋行的办事处以及一切大大小小的荷兰企业和商店今天都紧闭了门窗，印度尼西亚工人们在这些荷兰企业的大门前升起了红旗，表示罢工正在进行。
    罢工进行得很有秩序。有些工人守在企业里，以防止破坏活动的发生。
    今天，雅加达没有荷兰文报纸出版。全印度尼西亚八家荷兰文日报都被禁止出版。印度尼西亚情报部长已经根据内阁12月1日会议的决定，宣布禁止一切荷兰文报纸和刊物在印度尼西亚出版和流通。所有用荷兰文说明的影片都被禁止放映。这个决定已经开始执行。
    情报部长还宣布，从12月2日开始，不准荷兰皇家航空公司的飞机在印度尼西亚降落或停留。这家公司在印度尼西亚的全部飞机被命令尽快离开印度尼西亚。
    对荷兰企业采取的这一系列的措施都是在昨天的内阁会议上通过的。印度尼西亚政府前已宣告，如果西伊里安问题在联合国得不到解决，印度尼西亚政府就要采取进一步的行动。
    全印度尼西亚工会中央组织全国委员会已经打电报给世界工会联合会，要求各国工会在世界各地对荷兰的海空交通工具进行抵制。
