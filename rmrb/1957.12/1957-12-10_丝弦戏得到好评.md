    Silk String Opera Receives Acclaim
    The Shijiazhuang Silk String Opera Troupe gave its final performance in the capital on the 8th. This was the first time the Silk String Opera, which has a history of over 400 years in Hebei Province, has been performed in the capital. Its strong atmosphere of peasant life and its simple, unrestrained style have been well received by audiences.
    Silk String Opera is a relatively ancient local opera genre popular in the folk areas of Hebei Province. It has more than 600 plays and more than 500 musical tunes. Farmers in the Shijiazhuang area use "nine melodies and eighteen tunes, seventy-two hums" to describe the richness of Silk String Opera tunes.
    This Silk String Opera Troupe has performed seven plays in the capital since November 16, including "The Empty Seal Box," "Little Erjie's Dream," "Tuning the Bandit," "The White Jade Cup," and "Chasing the Son-in-Law." The Chinese Dramatists Association also held a symposium to discuss the art of Silk String Opera. Many audience members wrote letters to the troupe, thanking the artists for performing such an excellent opera genre in Beijing. Some drama workers and famous actors published their impressions of Silk String Opera in newspapers and periodicals after watching it.

    丝弦戏得到好评
    石家庄市丝弦剧团8日在首都作了最后一次公演。这是河北省有四百多年历史的丝弦戏第一次在首都演出。它的浓厚的农民生活气息和纯朴、奔放的风格，受到观众的好评。
    丝弦戏是流传在河北省民间的一个比较古老的地方剧种，共有六百多个剧目、五百多支音乐曲牌，石家庄一带的农民以“九腔十八调，七十二哼哼”来形容丝弦曲牌的丰富。
    这个丝弦剧团11月16日起在首都已先后演出了“空印盒”、“小二姐做梦”、“调寇”、“白玉杯”和“赶女婿”等七个剧目。中国戏剧家协会还召开了一次座谈会，对丝弦戏进行艺术上的探讨。有许多观众写信给剧团，感谢艺人们在北京演出了这样优秀的剧种。有些戏剧工作者、著名演员在报刊上发表了他们对丝弦戏的观后感。
