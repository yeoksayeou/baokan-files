　　Learn from the Typical Examples of High-Yielding Cotton!
　　This year, China has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of cotton. The total output of ginned cotton is expected to reach 32.8 million dan, exceeding the target of the First Five-Year Plan by 100,000 dan. This year, in various cotton-growing areas, a large number of high-yield typical examples have emerged on a large scale, which has never happened before. In five counties and cities, including Cixi in Zhejiang, Macheng and Guangji in Hubei, Shijiazhuang in Hebei, and Dunhuang in Gansu, the average cotton yield per mu reached more than 100 jin of ginned cotton. According to statistics from Hubei Province alone, there are more than 1,500 agricultural cooperatives with an average yield of more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and approximately 1,017,000 mu of cotton fields with a yield of more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. In addition, there are six high-yielding counties with an average yield of more than 80 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and forty counties with more than 60 jin. The emergence of these large-scale high-yield cotton achievements has changed the situation in the past where only a few small plots of cotton fields were high-yielding under the conditions of small-scale peasant economy, while the production level of general cotton fields was very low, and it shows that there is still great potential for increasing the yield per unit area of cotton.
　　The National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) puts forward the goal of striving to achieve an average yield of 40, 60, 80, and 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu in different regions within ten years. Next year, China will enter the period of the Second Five-Year Plan. In order to meet the growing needs of socialist construction and people's lives, we must continue to strive for continuous increase in cotton production in the future. This year's bumper cotton harvest and the creation of a large number of typical examples of high yield have laid a good foundation for increasing cotton production next year; we should widely summarize and promote advanced experience in increasing production and actively promote a great leap forward in cotton production next year.
　　There are many typical examples of large-scale high-yield cotton. The bumper cotton harvest in Macheng County, Hubei Province, and Xinye County, Henan Province, this year are two clear examples. In Macheng County, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu was 33 jin in 1950, 52 jin in 1955, 60 jin in 1956, and suddenly leaped to 103 jin in 1957, an increase of 70% compared with 1956, more than double the unit yield in 1950; it achieved the target of an average yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu put forward in the National Agricultural Development Program ten years ahead of schedule. Xinye County was originally a low-yield cotton area, with an average yield of only a dozen jin of ginned cotton per mu in the past. In 1955, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu was 14.42 jin, which increased to 33.67 jin in 1956 and jumped to 53 jin in 1957. The yield in 1957 increased by 63.5% compared with 1956, and more than two and a half times compared with 1955. Xinye County has leaped from a historical low-yield cotton area to become one of the cotton-producing counties with the highest unit area yield of cotton in Henan Province. There are similar examples in other cotton-producing areas. Many examples of leap-forward production increases in various regions provide good role models for all parts of the country to learn from.
　　In cotton-growing areas where cotton fields are relatively concentrated and the original yields are relatively high, we should learn from the experience of Macheng County, Hubei Province. How did Macheng County leap to become a high-yield county with a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu? The main reason is not good natural conditions, but the strong leadership of the Party. The Macheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China adhered to the style of going deep into the masses and into the production process, mobilized the masses to comprehensively formulate production increase plans, and insisted on implementing the plans through mass movements. Cadres engaged in experimental fields, took the lead in learning technology, and led production through production. Therefore, they were able to find the key to increasing production based on the conditions and characteristics of cotton production in their region, adhere to the implementation of comprehensive technical improvements, and carry out unremitting struggles against natural disasters such as drought, flood, and pests. They adopted the leadership method of "grasping both ends to drive the middle," constantly going deep into the production process, spreading advanced experience on the spot through organizing visits, comparisons, cotton field rankings, and organizing forces to support backward areas, so that the backward could quickly catch up with the advanced. In this way, not only a few cotton fields increased production, but also comprehensive production increase was achieved. There are currently about 50 million mu of cotton fields in the country with relatively concentrated and high yields. The conditions are generally similar to those in Macheng, and some are even better than those in Macheng. The example of Macheng County proves that in this type of cotton-growing area, even though the original yield is already relatively high, it is still possible to achieve a leap-forward production increase.
　　In scattered low-yield cotton areas, it is also possible to quickly change to high-yield areas. Xinye County, mentioned earlier, belongs to this type of situation. The main experience of the great leap forward in cotton production in Xinye County is that the county, township, and society all assigned special personnel to strengthen the leadership of cotton production, so that cotton, which accounts for a small proportion of various crops in the local area, has special personnel responsible at all levels. They rationally adjusted the distribution of cotton fields throughout the county, and appropriately concentrated the cotton fields in each agricultural cooperative, established cotton production professional teams, and strengthened the management of cotton fields. They also transferred cotton-planting experts from areas with high cotton yields to low-yield areas to conduct technical guidance, and at the same time adopted various methods to cultivate a large number of cotton-planting technicians to strengthen technical guidance and change the backward situation of cotton production technology. There are currently about 20 million mu of scattered low-yield cotton areas in the country, scattered in more than 600 counties. The example of Xinye County proves that in this type of cotton-growing area, even though the conditions are poor, it is entirely possible to achieve a great leap forward in production; and because the original yield is low, there is more potential for increasing production.
　　In recent years, the situation of cotton production increase in various regions can be roughly divided into three types: the first type is that cotton production has increased rapidly; the second type is that production has generally increased but the speed is not fast; and the third type is that production has increased very slowly or even decreased. In order to enable cotton to generally increase production greatly throughout the country next year, the first type of region must continue to increase production, and the second and third types of regions must break the situation of slow or stagnant production increase and learn from the first type of region. This year, there are many typical examples of high-yield in various cotton-growing areas with different conditions throughout the country. We should analyze their different conditions and practices, carefully summarize them, find out their successful experiences in leadership methods, technical measures, and management, widely exchange these experiences, and promote them. Promoting these advanced experiences can not only provide correct ways to increase production and working methods for various regions, but also effectively break the conservative ideas or complacency that exist among some cadres and the masses. In 1956, the widespread promotion of the experience of large-scale high-yield cotton in Xinjiang and Cixi, Zhejiang, played a significant role in breaking conservative ideas and improving cotton production technology; the reason why cotton achieved a leap-forward production increase this year is inseparable from the role played by the promotion of these advanced experiences.
　　In order to promote a great bumper cotton harvest next year, all regions must fight against conservative tendencies on the basis of summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, fully mobilize the masses, and formulate specific production increase plans for next year at all levels. In high-yield cotton areas, we should expand the large-scale high-yield demonstration of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and plan the units and area to reach 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu next year by county, township, agricultural cooperative, or production team. In order to achieve the goals stipulated in the draft National Agricultural Development Program in stages and batches, the area requiring 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu nationwide will be expanded to more than 15 million mu next year. Regions with lower yield levels can also formulate large-scale demonstration plans according to the requirements of 80, 60, or 40 jin per mu, respectively. When formulating plans, we must oppose empty slogans and mobilize the masses to discuss the specific conditions and measures for realizing the plan in the local area. For example, how much fertilizer to apply, how to prevent and control diseases and insect pests, strengthen drought prevention and drainage, and improve technology. Only when various measures are discussed well can the goals of the plan be achieved. Next year, the state will fully supply cotton-growing areas with medicines and machinery for pest control, and increase the supply of chemical fertilizers to cotton-growing areas, which will add favorable conditions for a great bumper cotton harvest next year. Of course, agricultural cooperatives should not unilaterally rely on state supply, but should make their best efforts to fully utilize the existing human and material resources in rural areas. This year's bumper cotton harvest has greatly increased the income of cotton-growing areas. Under this circumstance, agricultural cooperatives should appropriately increase production investment in cotton fields, actively improve the production conditions of cotton, and prepare funds as soon as possible to purchase improved agricultural tools, pest control medicines and machinery, and commercial fertilizers needed for cotton production next year. The specific measures of agricultural cooperatives to ensure production increase must be effectively incorporated into the production plan.
　　In order to promote a great bumper cotton harvest next year, all regions should take action now and prepare for production increase next year in winter. We must strengthen the basic construction work of drought prevention and drainage in cotton-growing areas, increase fertilizer accumulation in cotton fields, and at the same time seize the time to do a good job in winter plowing, winter irrigation, and cotton seed preparation in cotton fields. On the one hand, we must seize the work of increasing production in the main cotton-growing areas and vigorously cultivate high-yield and guaranteed-yield cotton production bases, and on the other hand, we must strengthen the leadership and support for low-yield cotton areas. In relatively concentrated and high-yield cotton areas, the area of cotton fields should generally be stabilized; in scattered low-yield cotton areas, the cotton fields should be appropriately adjusted in accordance with the principle of adapting to local conditions and appropriate concentration. We must drive comprehensive production increase through large-scale key demonstrations.
　　Through the socialist education movement in rural areas, through the publicity and discussion of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), the socialist awareness and enthusiasm for increasing production of farmers have been greatly improved. The further consolidation of agricultural cooperation, this year's bumper cotton harvest, and the creation of many large-scale high-yield experiences in various regions are all extremely favorable conditions for realizing a great bumper cotton harvest next year. At present, a new upsurge in agricultural production increase has emerged in the vast rural areas. Striving for a great bumper cotton harvest next year is one of the specific contents of the new upsurge in agricultural production increase. Leading organs and agricultural cooperatives at all levels in cotton-growing areas should seize the opportunity, fully utilize all favorable conditions, and make all preparations for realizing a great bumper cotton harvest next year as soon as possible.

　　向棉花高额丰产的典型看齐
    今年我国的棉花空前丰收。预计全国皮棉总产量可达到三千二百八十万担，超额十万担完成了第一个五年计划的指标。今年在各个不同的棉区，都涌现了大量的过去从未有过的大面积的丰产典型。浙江的慈溪、湖北的麻城、广济、河北的石家庄、甘肃的敦煌等五个县市，平均每亩棉花产量达到皮棉一百斤以上。据湖北一省的统计，今年棉花平均单位面积产量在皮棉一百斤以上的农业合作社就有一千五百多个，亩产皮棉一百斤以上的棉田共约一百零一万七千亩。此外，全国还有平均产量超过每亩皮棉八十斤的丰产县六个，超过六十斤的丰产县四十个。这许多大面积的棉花丰产成绩的出现，改变了过去在小农经济条件下仅有零星小块棉田丰产，而一般棉田生产水平很低的局面，并且显示了提高棉花的单位面积产量还有很大的潜力。
    全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）对于今后棉花增产提出了十年内按不同地区分别达到平均亩产皮棉四十斤、六十斤、八十斤、一百斤的奋斗指标。明年我国就要进入第二个五年计划时期。为了社会主义建设和人民生活不断增长的需要，我们还必须争取棉花在今后不断地增产。今年棉花的丰收和普遍大量的丰产典型经验的创造，给明年的棉花增产打下了很好的基础；我们应该广泛地总结和推广先进的增产经验，积极地推动明年棉花生产的大跃进。
    棉花大面积丰产的典型是不少的。湖北省麻城县和河南省新野县今年棉花大丰收，就是两个显明的例子。麻城县1950年全县棉花平均亩产皮棉三十三斤，1955年平均亩产皮棉五十二斤，1956年平均亩产皮棉六十斤，1957年一下子跃进到平均亩产皮棉一百零三斤，比1956年提高了70％，超过1950年的单位产量二倍以上；提前十年实现了农业发展纲要提出的平均亩产一百斤皮棉的指标。新野县原来是一个低产棉区，历来棉田平均亩产量只有十几斤皮棉，1955年每亩平均皮棉产量是十四点四二斤，1956年提高到三十三点六七斤，1957年跃进到五十三斤。1957年比1956年提高了63.5％，比1955年提高了二倍半以上。新野县已由一个历史性的低产棉区，一跃而成为河南省棉花单位面积产量最高的产棉县之一。像这样的例子，其他产棉区也有。各个地区实现跃进增产的许多事例，为全国各地提供了很好的学习榜样。
    在棉田比较集中、原来产量较高的棉区，应该学习湖北麻城县的经验。麻城县是怎样一跃而成为亩产百斤皮棉的高产县呢？主要原因不是自然条件好，而是党的领导强。中共麻城县委坚持了深入群众、深入生产过程的作风，发动群众全面制订增产规划，又通过群众运动坚持实行规划。干部搞试验田，带头学习技术，以生产领导生产。因此，他们能够根据本地区棉花生产的条件和特点，找出增产关键，坚持实施综合性的技术改进，对旱、涝、虫害等自然灾害进行了不懈的斗争。他们采取“抓两头带动中间”的领导方法，不断地深入生产过程，通过组织参观，评比，棉田排队，当场传播先进经验，并组织力量支援落后地区，使落后的迅速赶上先进的。这样，就不只是少数棉田增产，而做到了全面增产。全国现有棉田比较集中产量较高的棉区，共约五千多万亩，条件一般和麻城相差不多，有些比麻城的条件更好。麻城县的事例证明，在这一类棉区，虽然原来的产量已经是比较高的了，也仍然可以跃进增产。
    在分散的低产棉区，也可以迅速地改变为高产地区。前面所说的新野县就属于这一种情况。新野县棉花生产大跃进的主要经验是：县、乡、社都指定专人加强对棉花生产的领导，使得在本地各项作物中占比重较小的棉花，层层有专人负责。他们在全县范围内合理地调整了棉田的分布，并且在各个农业社内把棉田适当集中起来，设立棉花生产专业队，加强棉田的经营管理。他们还从棉花产量较高的地区抽调植棉能手，到低产地区进行技术辅导，同时采取各种方法大量培养植棉技术人员，加强技术指导工作，改变棉花生产技术落后的情况。全国现有分散低产棉区约二千多万亩，分散在六百多个县。新野县的事例证明，在这一类棉区，虽然条件较差，实现生产大跃进也是完全可能的；而且因为原来的产量低，就有更多的增产潜力。
    近几年来各个地区棉花增产的情况，大体上可以分为三种类型：第一种是棉花产量提高得很快的；第二种是一般增产而速度不快的；第三种是增产很慢甚至反而减产的。为了使明年全国棉花能够普遍地大增产，第一类地区要继续增产，第二类、第三类地区要打破增产缓慢或停滞的局面，向第一类地区看齐。全国各个条件不同的棉区，今年都有不少高额丰产的典型。应该分析它们的不同的条件和作法，认真地进行总结，找出他们在领导方法、技术措施、经营管理等方面的成功经验，广泛地交流这些经验，并且加以推广。推广这些先进的经验，不仅可以给各地提供正确的增产途径和工作方法，而且可以有效地打破一些干部和群众中存在的保守思想或自满情绪。1956年全国普遍推广了新疆和浙江慈溪等地的棉花大面积丰产经验，对于打破保守思想，提高棉花生产技术，就起了显著的作用；今年棉花所以获得跃进增产，和推广这些先进经验所起的作用是分不开的。
    为了推动明年棉花大丰产，各地要在总结和推广先进经验的基础上，同保守倾向作斗争，充分发动群众，层层制定明年的具体的增产规划。在高产的棉区，应该扩大百斤皮棉的大面积丰产示范，按县、乡、农业社或生产队分别规划出明年达到百斤皮棉的单位和面积。为了分期分批达到全国农业发展纲要草案所规定的目标，全国明年要求亩产百斤皮棉的面积将扩增到一千五百万亩以上。产量水平较低的地区，可以分别按照亩产八十斤、六十斤或四十斤的要求也分别订出大面积示范的计划。制订计划的时候必须反对空喊高调，必须发动群众讨论当地实现规划的具体条件和具体措施。例如，增施多少肥料，如何防治病虫，加强防旱排涝，改进技术等。只有把各种措施讨论好，规划的目标才能达到。明年国家将对棉区充分供应治虫的药械，并且增加一部分化学肥料供应棉区，这就为明年的棉花大丰产添加了有利的条件。当然，农业社也不要片面地依赖国家供应，而应当自己作最大的努力，充分利用农村中现有的人力物力。今年棉花大丰收，棉区收入大大增加，在这种情况下，农业社就应该适当地增加棉田的生产投资，积极改善棉花的生产条件，及早准备资金，以便购买明年棉花生产所需要的改良农具、治虫药械和商品肥料。农业社保证增产的各项具体措施，都要切实地订到生产规划中去。
    为了推动明年棉花大丰产，各地现在就应该行动起来，在冬季就为明年的增产作好准备。要加强棉区防旱排涝的基本建设工作，增积棉田肥料，同时抓紧时间，做好棉田的冬耕、冬灌和棉种准备等工作。一方面必须抓紧主要棉区的增产工作，大力培养高产保收的棉产基地，同时也必须加强对低产棉区的领导和支援。在比较集中而高产的棉区，棉田面积一般地应该稳定下来；在分散低产的棉区，应该本着因地制宜、适当集中的原则，适当地调整棉田，要通过大面积的重点示范，带动全面增产。
    通过农村社会主义的教育运动，通过农业发展纲要（修正草案）的宣传和讨论，农民的社会主义觉悟和增产积极性已经大大地提高了。农业合作化的进一步巩固，今年棉花的大丰收和各地许多大面积的丰产经验的创造，都是明年实现棉花大丰产的极有利的条件。目前，广大的农村已经出现农业增产的新高潮。争取明年棉花大丰产，是农业增产新高潮的具体内容之一。棉区各级领导机关和农业社，应该紧紧地掌握时机，充分运用各项有利条件，及早为实现明年的棉花大丰产做好一切准备工作。
