Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: As the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) top-level meeting to plot nuclear war preparations takes place, the public in many European countries has launched waves of protests. Public opinion in these countries also strongly opposes equipping NATO member states' armed forces, particularly West Germany's, with nuclear and rocket weapons.

The wave of public protest in Germany against NATO's atomic armament plans at the Paris conference is surging.

The working people in various districts of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) have passed numerous resolutions demanding the establishment of a nuclear weapon-free zone in Central Europe. People from all walks of life in one district held many conferences, passing nearly one hundred such resolutions. The Gera District Council of the German Democratic Republic forwarded the Communist and Workers' Parties' Peace Manifesto and the People's Chamber's proposal to the Bavarian State Parliament of West Germany, requesting its support for the demands of the peace forces in Germany.

Various women's and youth groups and peace organizations in West Germany opposed to compulsory military service have participated in this widespread movement against atomic armament.

The West German "Bavarian Peace Movement Action Organization" submitted an appeal on December 16 to the West German delegation attending the NATO Paris conference, resolutely protesting against equipping the West German "Bundeswehr" with nuclear and rocket weapons and opposing the establishment of rocket bases in West Germany.

Ehler, Deputy Chairman of the Social Democratic Party's parliamentary group in the West German Bundestag, delivered a radio address on December 15. He said that the atomic arms race has reached such a dangerous level that continuing it would "lead to disaster." Ehler believes that NATO should re-evaluate the path it is taking. Ehler believes that the German unification issue can only be gradually resolved by taking measures to halt the arms race and conclude a supervised disarmament agreement. Ehler also advocated discussing Bulganin's letter at the NATO Paris conference.

West German Social Democratic Party Vice Chairman Mellis opposed the arms race at a Social Democratic Party conference in Dortmund. He accused the West German government of deliberately concealing from the public the plan for the NATO meeting to make decisions on the establishment of atomic rocket launch sites.

The Seine Provincial Peace Council of France issued a statement again protesting the authorities' prohibition of working people from holding demonstrations during the NATO summit. The statement called on working people to send delegations to meet with city councilors and members of the National Assembly, asking them to express the residents of Paris's districts' desire for peace to the French government and all foreign delegations attending the meeting at the Palais de Chaillot. The Peace Council also suggested that working people directly send telegrams and letters to the heads of government of all countries participating in the NATO conference for this purpose.

Italian public opinion is deeply concerned about the government authorities listening to the United States' opinions and turning Italy into an atomic rocket depot. Newspapers representing different political factions have called for abandoning the plan to deploy atomic rockets in Italy as soon as possible and embarking on the path of easing international tensions.

The Socialist Party's organ, "Avanti!," wrote that turning Italy into an American atomic strategic base means that Italy will in the future be nothing more than "a pawn in the international arena, which will not only gain nothing but will only lose everything."

The Communist Party's organ, "Unità," severely criticized the plan to deploy American rockets on Italian territory.

The bourgeois newspaper "Il Giorno," published in Milan, worried that blindly following the United States would lead Italy onto a dangerous path. The newspaper said, "Equipping the West German armed forces with atomic weapons is the prelude to a new disaster. At the same time, withdrawing troops from Europe is the only way to let the world feel a sense of relief."

The Dutch Peace Council issued an appeal to the Dutch people regarding the flight of American bombers carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs over the Netherlands, calling on them to unite and launch a powerful movement to oppose the new insane behavior of the NATO aggressive bloc.

    反对北大西洋集团准备核战争
    欧洲公众掀起抗议浪潮
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：在策划核战争准备的北大西洋集团最高级会议举行的时候，欧洲许多国家的公众纷纷掀起了抗议的浪潮，这些国家的舆论界也强烈反对用核武器和火箭武器装备北大西洋集团成员国军队，尤其是西德的军队。
    德国公众抗议北大西洋集团巴黎会议原子备战计划的浪潮在高涨。
    民主德国各专区劳动人民通过许许多多决议，要求在欧洲中部建立不存放原子武器的地区。有一个专区的各界人民举行许多大会，通过了将近一百个这样的决议。民主德国的格拉专区议会把共产党和工人党和平宣言和人民议院的建议转给西德巴伐利亚州议会，并且要求它支持德国和平力量的主张。
    西德反对义务兵役制的各个妇女和青年团体以及和平团体都参加了这个广泛的反对原子备战的运动。
    西德“巴伐利亚和平运动行动组织”16日向参加北大西洋集团巴黎会议的西德代表团提出呼吁书，坚决抗议用核武器和火箭武器装备西德“国防军”并且反对在西德建立火箭基地。
    西德社会民主党联邦议院党团副主席埃勒15日发表广播演说。他说，原子军备竞赛已经达到这样危险的程度，要是再继续下去就要“导致灾祸”。埃勒认为，北大西洋集团应重新估计它所走的道路。埃勒认为，只有在采取措施停止军备竞赛和缔结有监督的裁军协定的情况下，德国统一问题才能逐渐解决。埃勒还主张在北大西洋集团巴黎会议上讨论布尔加宁的信。
    西德社会民主党副主席梅利斯在多特蒙德举行的社会民主党会议上反对军备竞赛。他指责西德政府故意向公众隐瞒这次北大西洋集团会议要对建立原子火箭发射基地问题作出决定的计划。
    法国塞纳省和平理事会发表声明，再次抗议当局禁止劳动人民在北大西洋公约组织最高级会议开会期间举行示威游行。声明号召劳动人民派代表团去见市议员和国民议会议员，请他们向法国政府和在夏乐宫参加会议的所有外国代表团表达巴黎各区居民渴望和平的意愿。和平理事会还建议劳动人民为此直接打电报和写信给参加北大西洋公约组织会议的各国政府首脑。
    意大利舆论界对政府当局听从美国意见、要把意大利变为原子火箭仓库的做法深感不安。代表不同政治派别的报纸都呼吁趁早放弃在意大利安置原子火箭的计划，而走上缓和国际紧张局势的道路。
    社会党机关报“前进报”写道，把意大利变为美国的原子战略基地，意味着意大利将来不过是“国际角逐场中的一名小卒，它不但一无所获，而且只会把一切输光”。
    共产党机关报“团结报”严厉抨击在意大利领土上配置美国火箭的计划。
    在米兰发行的资产阶级报纸“日报”担心盲目追随美国会把意大利引上危险的道路。这家报纸说，“用原子武器装备西德武装力量是新灾难的序幕。而同时把军队撤出欧洲，是让世界能够感到如释重负的唯一办法”。
    荷兰和平理事会就带有原子弹和氢弹的美国轰炸机在荷兰上空飞行一事，向荷兰人民发表了呼吁书，号召他们团结起来，展开强大的运动，反对北大西洋公约侵略集团新的疯狂行为。
