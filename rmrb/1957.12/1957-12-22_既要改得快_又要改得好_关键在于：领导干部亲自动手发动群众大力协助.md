To Reform Quickly and Well
The Key Lies in Leading Cadres Taking the Lead and Mobilizing the Masses for Vigorous Assistance
By our commentator

The general rectification work of state organs is nearing completion. During this period, because the leading cadres of many units had the determination to rectify and adopted the mass line method, they carried out concentrated rectification, so in a very short period, they solved 70%, 80%, or even more than 90% of the opinions raised by the masses. Judging from the progress, it was rapid, ensuring quantity; judging from the content, the problems were generally solved correctly, ensuring quality. This achieved the standard of being both fast and good, creating favorable conditions for further rectification.

However, facts also show that in a few units, the rectification work is not satisfactory. Some are carried out behind closed doors, with slow progress; others pursue quantity and ignore quality. These two situations, especially the latter, demonstrate an extremely unserious attitude towards the rectification movement and the opinions of the masses.

The Ministry of Communications recently inspected the rectification work of the Highway Bureau under its jurisdiction. As of the 14th, the Highway Bureau had rectified 1,448 items, accounting for 57% of the total number of opinions from the masses. Judging from the quantity, it is not too small, and the opinions raised by the masses regarding the canteen work, file work, and business trip issues of staff members have indeed been seriously resolved. However, among the problems that have been solved, some problems have not actually been solved, or the solutions are very incomplete. First, of the 602 criticisms made by the masses against leading cadres above the section chief level, although those criticized all expressed acceptance of the criticism from the masses, it was not each person criticized who personally expressed this attitude to the masses, but rather the rectification office of the bureau summarized and simply announced it. This approach cannot express the sincerity of the individual, nor can it satisfy the demands of the masses. Second, although the problem is considered solved, it is either not solved perfectly or is very inappropriate. One type is inconsistent with the original intention of the person who raised the opinion. For example, an engineer suggested that engineers were being used improperly, causing some people to be uneasy about their work. In his opinion, he also mentioned that the leadership placed his desk at the door, exposed to the cold wind. Obviously, this engineer was criticizing the leadership's improper use and lack of respect for engineering and technical personnel, but the leadership's handling method was only to change the position of the engineer's desk. Another type is answering irrelevant questions. For example, someone suggested restoring the intermodal transport method once used in East China (setting up transfer stations), and the reply was that there is already intermodal transport (connecting various means of transportation), but these are two different things. Still another type is making a big issue into a small one. For example, someone suggested vigorously promoting alternative fuel vehicles and other advanced experiences. These belong to relatively important technical policy issues that require careful study, but a general attitude was expressed, replying "will pay attention in the future." Someone criticized a section's leadership for being busy and chaotic. This type of problem could be addressed immediately, but it was postponed to be "resolved when discussing the organizational system," and this type of response was also counted as having addressed the opinions of the masses. In addition, the unit made "empty promises" to resolve problems that it could not solve. In the process of handling opinions, there was also a phenomenon of mutual buck-passing between sections.

It is not difficult to see that this method of rectification by the Highway Bureau is not good. First, because some problems are not solved thoroughly or appropriately, work cannot take a leap forward after the rectification movement; second, because in general, only some individual problems are solved on a case-by-case basis, and there is no inspection and resolution from the leadership's perspective, the leadership's thinking may remain the same after the rectification movement. It should be pointed out that our rectification movement is not for show, not simply for making some percentage statistics, but requires practical results, requiring the improvement of work, improvement of style, and improvement of thinking through the rectification movement. In the process of rectification, the problems that have been solved should be statistically recorded with numbers to check the progress of rectification. However, each number must represent a solid rectification content, and cannot be used to fill the ranks. If one only pursues numbers and the increase in percentages without regard to quality, the practical significance of rectification is lost.

In the rectification movement, the problems raised by the masses should be solved quickly, but speed alone is not enough. While seeking speed, we must also ensure quality, must reform well, thoroughly, and correctly. Otherwise, formally it has been reformed, even very quickly, but in fact it has not been reformed, or it has been reformed very poorly. The so-called reforming well and reforming correctly means reforming in a realistic manner, neither satisfying wrong demands without principle, nor perfunctorily dealing with them. Reforming realistically requires earnestly analyzing and studying the opinions of the masses, immediately reforming what can be reformed immediately, boldly reforming; explaining the reasons to the masses for what cannot be reformed immediately, and reforming after mature research; explaining the incorrect opinions, and not adopting the approach of accepting everything. The reason why the Highway Bureau's rectification work has the phenomenon of filling the ranks is precisely because it seeks speed without seeking quality, only cares about quantity without caring about quality, and lacks a realistic attitude.

According to the experience of many units in state organs, the rectification work is done both quickly and well, depending on two main methods. One is that leaders take the lead, that is, the top leader takes charge; the other is to mobilize the masses for rectification, fully following the mass line. The Highway Bureau did not well accept these experiences. The leaders did not personally grasp the overall rectification work, but pushed some problems that should have been solved by the bureau to the sections, and did not fully mobilize the masses for rectification. The rectification work was mainly undertaken by a few people in the rectification office. Due to the lack of participation and help from leaders, and the failure to vigorously and fully mobilize the masses, some comrades in charge of rectification work in some sections did not have enough confidence in the rectification work, but were "dealing with it while worrying."

The rectification situation of the Highway Bureau should not continue and should be immediately reversed. The Ministry of Communications has decided that the Highway Bureau will conduct a review and launch a mass review upsurge. This measure is completely correct and timely.

    既要改得快  又要改得好
    关键在于：领导干部亲自动手发动群众大力协助
    本报评论员
    当前国家机关的一般性整改工作即将告一段落。在这个时期，由于许多单位的领导干部具有整改决心，采取群众路线方法，进行了集中整改，所以在很短时期内，解决了群众所提意见总数的百分之七十、八十甚至九十以上。从进度看，是迅速的，保证了数量；从内容看，问题解决得一般是正确的，保证了质量。这样就达到了又快又好的标准，为下一步深入整改创造了有利的条件。
    但是，也有事实说明，在少数单位中，整改工作是不能令人满意的。有的关门整改，进度迟缓；有的追求数量，忽视质量。这两种情况特别是后一种情况，表现了对整风运动、对群众意见的极不严肃态度。
    交通部最近对所属公路总局的整改工作进行了检查。到14日为止，公路总局已改一千四百四十八条，占群众意见总数的57％。从数量看，并不算太少，而且对群众在食堂工作、档案工作、工作人员出差问题等方面提出的意见，也确实作了认真的解决。但是，在已解决的问题中间，有些问题实际上并没有解决，或者解决的很不彻底。其一，群众对科长以上领导干部提出的批评意见六百零二条，虽然被批评者都曾表示接受群众的批评，但不是由每一个被批评者亲自向群众表示这种态度，而是由局整风办公室综合归纳简单公布的。这种作法既不能表达本人的诚意，也不能满足群众的要求。其二，问题虽算解决了，但解决的不完满或是很不恰当。其中一类是与提意见者的本意不相符合。如一位工程师提出对工程师的使用不当，以致有人不安心工作。在他的意见中，又提到领导方面把他的办公桌安置在门口，喝西北风。显然，这位工程师是对领导方面对工程技术人员的使用不当和尊重不够提出批评，而领导方面的处理办法却只是把这位工程师的桌子掉换了一下位置。另一类是答非所问。如有人建议恢复华东地区曾用过的联运办法（设立转运站），答复现在已有联运（各种运输工具衔接运输），其实这是两回事。再一类是大事小办。如有人建议大力推广代燃车以及其他先进经验，这些是属于比较重大的技术政策问题，需要慎重研究，却一般性表示态度，答复“今后注意”。有人批评一个处的领导工作忙乱，这类问题，目前本可着手解决，却推到“讨论机构体制时解决”，并且把这类答复也算作对群众意见已作处理。此外，本单位本来不能解决的问题开下了解决的“空头支票”。在处理意见过程中，处与处之间也有互相推诿的现象。
    不难看出，公路总局的这种整改方法是不好的。第一，由于有些问题解决的不彻底，不恰当，整风运动过后，工作不可能跃进一步；第二，由于一般多是就事论事地解决一些个别问题，而没有从领导角度进行检查和解决，整风运动过后，领导思想可能依然故我。应该指出，我们的整风运动，不是为了作给人看的，不是单纯为了作些百分比的统计，而是要求切实的效果，要求通过整风运动改进工作，改进作风，提高思想。在整改过程中，对于已解决的问题，应当用数字作出统计，用来检查整改的进度。但是，每个数字必须代表一项扎扎实实的整改内容，而不能滥竽充数。如果仅仅追求数字，追求百分比的增加而不顾质量，就失去了整改的实际意义。
    在整风运动中，对群众提出的问题，应该解决的快，但是，光快是不够的。在求快的同时，还必须保证质量，必须改得好，改得彻底，改得正确。否则，形式上是改了，甚至改得很快，其实并没有改，或是改得很差。所谓改得好，改得正确，就是要实事求是地改，既不是无原则地满足错误的要求，更不是敷衍了事，草率应付。实事求是地改，必须切实分析和研究群众的意见，能立即改的就立即改，大胆改；不能立即改的向群众说明理由，留待研究成熟以后改；对不正确的意见则进行解释，而不能采取一概包下来的作法。公路总局在整改工作中所以出现滥竽充数现象，正是由于求快而不求好，只顾数量而不顾质量，缺乏实事求是的态度的缘故。
    根据国家机关许多单位的经验，整改工作作得既快又好，取决于两个主要的方法。一是领导者亲自动手，也就是第一把手挂帅；一是发动群众进行整改，充分走群众路线。公路总局却没有很好地接受这些经验，领导者没有亲自抓全局性的整改工作，而是把一些应由局解决的问题也推到处去解决，更没有充分发动群众进行整改，整改工作主要由整风办公室的少数人担负。由于缺乏领导者的参与和帮助，没有大力充分发动群众，因此有的处担任整改工作的同志对整改工作也没有足够的信心，而是“一面处理，一面担心”。
    公路总局的整改状况是不应该继续下去的，应该立即加以扭转。交通部已经决定公路总局进行复查，并且在全部掀起一个群众性复查高潮。这一措施是完全正确的及时的。
