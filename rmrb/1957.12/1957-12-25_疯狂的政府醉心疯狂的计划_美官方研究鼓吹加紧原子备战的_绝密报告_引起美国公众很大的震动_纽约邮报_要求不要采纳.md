Xinhua News Agency, 24th Dispatch from Washington: The U.S. government is preparing to accelerate its atomic arms race program based on the so-called "Gaither Committee" top-secret report. It is revealed that this report was discussed at the National Security Council meeting convened by U.S. President Eisenhower on the 23rd.

The "Gaither Committee" was an organization composed of a group of major U.S. monopoly capitalists and government officials, established at Eisenhower's request to study the U.S. military situation. Recently, this committee, using the excuse that the Soviet Union's scientific achievements have made the United States a "second-rate country," put forward an extremely crazy plan advocating war preparations.

According to an article by the famous American commentator Drew Pearson published in the "Washington Post," Vice President Nixon has instructed that certain contents of the report be disclosed in order to garner support for it. Pearson pointed out that the central idea of this report is to advocate that the United States launch a "preemptive" war.

Talking about the specific content of the report, Pearson said that the report vigorously advocates increasing the "initial operational capability" of the U.S. "intermediate-range missiles" to four times its current target, and increasing the capability of "intercontinental missiles" to almost ten times. The report also suggests "more widely dispersing" and "strengthening" the "attack force" of the Strategic Air Command.

Here, the authors of the report have obviously forgotten that the U.S. intercontinental missiles are still in the initial testing stage, and even intermediate-range missiles have not yet been successfully tested. Moreover, officials predict that even if the tests are successful, production will not begin until a year and a half later.

The report also advocates increasing military spending by $20 billion over five years, peaking in 1961, making that year's military spending $5 billion higher than the current level of more than $38 billion.

According to a White House announcement on the 21st, the U.S. government has collected the reactions of senior government officials to the "Gaither Committee's" top-secret report for President Eisenhower's consideration. At the same time, relevant government departments and agencies will also study the main contents of the report, including the analysis, views, and recommendations in the report.

It is reported that the "Gaither Committee's" report has caused great shock among the American public. The "New York Post" pointed out in an editorial on the 19th that the arms expansion plan proposed by the committee is "crazy." The editorial pointed out that it can be seen from the committee's report that "preventive war is being considered as a countermeasure to get rid of the scientific and foreign policy difficulties the United States has fallen into." The editorial condemned that "the U.S. government has not been able to plan another way out besides war. But if its foreign policy bankruptcy (as demonstrated in Paris this week) can only lead it to consider launching the final conflict of mankind, it is unimaginable." The newspaper demanded that the government not adopt the "Gaither Committee's" plan.

### 疯狂的政府醉心疯狂的计划  美官方研究鼓吹加紧原子备战的“绝密报告”  引起美国公众很大的震动  “纽约邮报”要求不要采纳

    疯狂的政府醉心疯狂的计划
    美官方研究鼓吹加紧原子备战的“绝密报告”
    引起美国公众很大的震动  “纽约邮报”要求不要采纳
    新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府正在准备根据所谓“盖瑟委员会”的绝密报告来加紧原子备战计划。据透露，在23日美国总统艾森豪威尔召开的国家安全委员会会议上，曾经讨论了这个报告。
    “盖瑟委员会”是在艾森豪威尔的要求下由美国一批大垄断资本家和政府官员组成的研究美国军事情况的一个机构。这个委员会最近借口苏联的科学成就使美国沦为“二等国家”，提出了一个极为疯狂的鼓吹备战的计划。
    据“华盛顿邮报”刊载的美国著名评论员德鲁·皮尔逊的一篇文章说，为了争取对这个报告的支持，副总统尼克松已经授意把这个报告的某些内容加以透露。皮尔逊指出，这个报告的中心思想是：鼓吹美国发动“先发制人”的战争。
    谈到报告的具体内容，皮尔逊说，这个报告竭力主张把美国的“中程导弹”的“初步作战能力”提高到目前目标的四倍，把“洲际导弹”的能力增加到差不多十倍。报告还建议把战略空军司令部的“攻击力量”予以“更广泛的分散”和“加强”。
    在这里报告的作者显然忘记了美国的洲际导弹还在初步试验阶段，而即使中程导弹也还没有试验成功，而且，官方预料即使试验成功，也要在一年半以后才能开始生产。
    这个报告还主张在五年期间内增加军费开支二百亿美元，并以1961年为顶点，使这一年的军费比目前三百八十余亿美元的水平增加五十亿美元。
    据白宫21日宣布，美国政府已经把政府高级官员们对“盖瑟委员会”的绝密报告的反应收集起来，供艾森豪威尔总统考虑。同时，政府各有关部门和机构也将对报告的主要内容，包括报告中的分析、看法和建议进行研究。
    据报道，“盖瑟委员会”的报告在美国公众中已经引起很大的震动。“纽约邮报”在19日社论中指出，这个委员会提出的扩军计划是“疯狂”的。社论指出，从委员会报告可以看出，“正在考虑用预防性战争来作为摆脱美国已经陷入的那种科学上和外交政策上的困难处境的对策”。社论谴责“美国政府一直没有能计划出战争以外的另一个办法。但是如果它的外交政策的破产（像本星期在巴黎表明的那样）只能引导它去考虑发动人类最后的冲突，这是不可想像的”。这家报纸要求政府不要采纳“盖瑟委员会”的计划。
