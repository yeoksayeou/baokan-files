The fifty-one university graduates from the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who were assigned to participate in labor in the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Shanghai, wrote a letter to Premier Zhou Enlai on the 23rd, expressing their determination to follow Premier Zhou's instructions: consciously and persistently adhere to labor training and self-transformation, cultivate a labor viewpoint and a mass viewpoint, and fundamentally transform themselves into scientific workers who are both red and expert.

Premier Zhou Enlai visited them at the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative on the 22nd and answered their questions such as "Why should intellectuals participate in physical labor training?" and "What does it mean to be transformed into a working-class intellectual?".

In their letter to Premier Zhou, the university graduates said: Since we came to Shuguang Cooperative, we have only known how to work with the farmers for more than two months, but how to transform ourselves through labor training is still an unresolved issue. Your talk pointed out the direction for us to participate in labor and transform ourselves. We deeply remember what you said: "Intellectuals must undergo long-term training, especially labor training, to cultivate a mass viewpoint and a labor viewpoint, so that physical labor and mental labor are combined, and collective wisdom and individual talents are combined." We must comprehensively learn the noble qualities of the farmers, not only learn the farmers' production knowledge and labor experience, but also learn the farmers' spirit of hard work and frugality, truly integrate with the farmers in terms of thoughts and feelings, and fundamentally transform our bad habits.

In their letter to Premier Zhou, they also said: We once had doubts about participating in labor training: Should it be three months or six months? How can we be considered transformed? Now we understand: participating in labor is not for obtaining a "labor graduation certificate." To be transformed into a working-class intellectual is not determined by any exam or leadership approval, but by the masses' approval. We must consciously train ourselves for a long time, and we must seriously adhere to physical labor now and in the future, comprehensively learn the noble qualities of the working people, and establish contact with the Shuguang Cooperative after returning to the Academy of Sciences, and go to the fields to work again at any time, so as to transform ourselves into working-class intellectuals who wholeheartedly serve the working people.

    上海参加劳动的大学生写信给周总理
    决心坚持劳动锻炼和自我改造
    中国科学院上海办事处分配在上海郊区曙光农业社参加劳动的五十一名大学毕业生，23日写信给周恩来总理，表示决心遵照周总理的指示：自觉地长期地坚持劳动锻炼和自我改造，培养劳动观点和群众观点，从本质上改造自己成为又红又专的科学工作者。
    周恩来总理曾在22日到曙光农业社探望他们，并且回答了他们提出的“知识分子为什么要参加体力劳动的锻炼”和“怎样才算改造成工人阶级的知识分子”等问题。
    大学毕业生们给周总理的信中说：我们来到曙光社以后，两个多月来只知道与农民一起劳动，可是对如何通过劳动锻炼来改造自己，还是一个没有解决的问题。你的谈话给我们指出了参加劳动改造自己的方向。我们深深记住你所讲的：“知识分子要经过长期的锻炼，特别要经过劳动锻炼，培养起群众观点和劳动观点，使体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合，集体的智慧和个人的才能相结合。”我们要全面学习农民的高贵品质，不仅学习农民的生产知识和劳动经验，还要学习农民的艰苦朴素和勤俭节约的精神，真正地从思想感情上和农民打成一片，从本质上改造自己的坏习气。
    他们给周总理的信中还说：我们曾经对参加劳动锻炼发生过疑问：劳动三个月还是六个月呢？怎样才算改造好了呢？现在我们明白了：参加劳动不是为了取得一纸“劳动毕业证书”，要改造成为工人阶级知识分子，不是通过什么考试或领导批准来决定的，而是要由群众来批准。我们一定要自觉地长期地锻炼自己，现在和今后都要认真坚持体力劳动，全面学习劳动人民的高贵品质，回到科学院以后，也要和曙光社建立联系，随时再下地劳动，由此把自己改造成为全心全意为劳动人民服务的工人阶级知识分子。　　　　　　　　（新华社）
