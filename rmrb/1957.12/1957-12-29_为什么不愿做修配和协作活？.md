Why are People Unwilling to Do Repair, Parts and Collaboration Work?
	Kong Sang
The Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industry's unwillingness to do repair, parts and collaboration work has resulted in: some factories having their plans to manufacture new products fall through because no one helped them modify their machines; some factories having their product quality severely affected, even leading to work stoppages and reduced production, because no one helped them repair their equipment; and because socialist industry abandoned this position, capitalism took advantage of the gap, developing many "underground factories."

Unwillingness to do repair, parts and collaboration work is not unique to Tianjin, nor is it limited to local industry! Haven't many state-owned mechanical and electrical factories experienced similar situations? On the one hand, they are "underfed" and plead with the central government for tasks; on the other hand, no one is doing the repair work for other industrial sectors, forcing them to ask the state for investment to build additional repair factories and workshops; and many factories waste a lot of manpower and time due to squabbles over collaborative tasks.

There are many reasons for the shortcomings in repair, parts and collaboration work. Some are subjective, and some are objective; some are the responsibility of higher-level leading organs, and some are the responsibility of lower-level organs and enterprises. However, a very important common ideological reason is that some comrades dislike repair and collaboration work because it is troublesome, labor-intensive, generates low output value, and yields low profits, making it difficult to show results; while producing batch-processed regular products is easier to manage, allows for faster growth in output value, and enables faster technological progress, making it seem more "promising" than doing repair work. To put it more deeply, this kind of thinking means only considering one's own development, without thinking about the fact that everyone should and needs to develop; only thinking about promoting oneself, without thinking about promoting others at the same time.

Of course, the desire to develop faster, to hand over more profits to the state, and to learn and master new technologies, this kind of enthusiasm and motivation should be affirmed. Without this drive, we cannot promote China's production and construction in a faster, better, and more economical way. The fact that Tianjin's mechanical and electrical industry increased from manufacturing fifty-four kinds of products to eight hundred kinds of products in five years is of great benefit to the country. Criticizing them for being unwilling to do repair work and collaboration work is not intended to negate this enthusiasm. However, giving full play to the enthusiasm and motivation of one's own system must have a prerequisite, and that is the overall interests of the country. Things that can promote a region, a department, or an enterprise should certainly be done; things that can promote the entire country should be done even more. There are also times when it seems to meet the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical from the perspective of a region, a department, or an enterprise, but from a national perspective, it may hinder or offset the development of other regions, other industries, and other factories, to a certain extent playing a counterproductive role. Such things are not truly more, faster, better, and more economical. In this case, we must sacrifice local interests to seek overall interests. In a word, when implementing the general line of building socialism by going all out, aiming high and achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results, on the one hand, we must be resolute, active, and energetic, opposing the conservative tendency of shrinking back; on the other hand, we must always remember that more, faster, better, and more economical must proceed from the overall interests of the country, preventing and opposing local viewpoints, departmentalism, and regionalism.

    为什么不愿做修配和协作活？
    孔桑
    天津市机电工业局不愿意做修配和协作活，得到的结果是：有的工厂因为没有人帮助改装机器，使制造新产品的计划落空了；有的工厂因为没有人帮助修配设备，严重地影响了产品质量，甚至停工减产；因为社会主义工业放弃了这个阵地，还被资本主义钻了空子，发展了许多“地下工厂”。
    不愿意做修配和协作活，岂止天津一个地方存在，又岂止地方工业存在！许多国营机电工厂不也有过这种情形吗？一方面“吃不饱”，向中央争任务；一方面其他产业部门的修配活没人干，不得不向国家要投资来另外建设修理厂、修理车间；不少工厂因为协作任务扯皮，不知道浪费了多少人力和时间。
    造成修配和协作工作中的缺点，原因很多。有主观原因，也有客观原因；有该由上级领导机关负责的，也有该下级机关和企业负责的。但是其中有一个很重要的共同的思想原因，就是有些同志嫌修配和协作活麻烦、费工、产值小、利润低，不容易显出成绩；而做成批的正规产品，生产管理比较简便，产值增长得快，技术进步快，比干修理活有“出息”。这种思想，再说得深一点，就是只想到自己的发展，而没有想到大家都应当、都需要发展；只想到促进自己，而没有想到同时也要促进别人。
    当然，愿意发展得快一些，愿意多给国家上缴些利润，愿意学习和掌握新技术，这种积极性和上进心是应当肯定的，没有这股劲头，就不能多快好省地促进我国的生产建设事业。天津的机电工业在五年中从制造五十四种产品增加到八百种产品，这对国家有很大的好处，批判他们不愿做修配活和协作活，并不是要把这种积极性也反掉。但是，发挥本系统的积极性和上进心，必须有一个前提，这就是国家的整体利益。能够促进一个地区、一个部门、一个企业的事情，固然要干；能够促进整个国家的事情，就更要干。有些时候还有这样的情形：从一个地区、一个部门、一个企业来看，似乎合乎多快好省的要求，但从全国来看，却可能妨碍或抵消了其他地区、其他产业、其他工厂的发展，在一定程度上发生促退的作用。像这样的事情，就不是真正的多快好省，在这种情形下，就要牺牲局部的利益来谋取整体的利益。一句话，在贯彻执行多快好省的方针时，一方面要坚决、积极、有干劲，反对畏缩不前的保守倾向；另一方面，也要时时记住多快好省要以国家的整体利益出发，防止和反对局部观点、本位主义和地方主义。
