　　The Friendship Coal Mine Under Construction
　　By Our Correspondent　Peng Fengye
    We have visited the Nalaihe Coal Mine twice already. This, Mongolia's largest coal mine—the Friendship Coal Mine—is changing so fast, looking different every year, and will soon be officially put into production.
    Last winter, on a snowy day, we arrived here for the first time. The coal mine base under construction was covered in white snow, and in the severe cold of minus twenty or thirty degrees, the workers were working hard. At that time, Comrade Ganbuzhabu, the director of the Coal Mine Administration, received us in a temporary office. The room was not big, crowded with people, and everyone listened with great interest as he explained the past and future of the mine based on a rough sketch. At that time, a pair of new vertical shafts were being excavated underground, and we could only visit some auxiliary projects on the ground.
    This year, winter came a little later, but Nalaihe, with its higher terrain, had already experienced snowfall. In the early winter, when the coal mine project was nearing completion, we visited it again.
    The Nalaihe Coal Mine is located east of Ulaanbaatar, more than forty kilometers away, and is connected to the Mongolian capital by a narrow-gauge railway. This is the earliest railway built in Mongolia, a dedicated line for transporting coal from Nalaihe. We drove along this railway, and on the right, another broad-gauge railway snaked across the grassland, which is the "Friendship Railway" connecting the capitals of Mongolia, China, and the Soviet Union. The newly built coal mine has constructed a dedicated line connecting to this main line, preparing to transport coal to the capital, as the original narrow-gauge railway can no longer handle this transportation task.
    The highway sandwiched between the two railways is also being renovated. The construction project of a section of asphalt road and a highway bridge is a Chinese aid project to Mongolia, and Chinese workers are working tirelessly.
    The Nalaihe Coal Mine had sporadic mining operations before the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution. After the revolution, the coal mine belonged to the state and was mined manually and with some machinery to supply the people. Due to the development of urban construction and industrial production in Mongolia, the demand for coal gradually increased. Therefore, with the help of Soviet experts, after surveying and designing, the construction of a pair of automated coal mine vertical shafts began here in 1955. This is the coal mine we are now going to visit.
    The entire construction process of the coal mine fully embodies the fraternal friendship of socialist countries helping each other. From surveying, designing, construction to installation, all projects of the coal mine were carried out under the direct assistance of Soviet experts, and the complete set of equipment was also supplied by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union provided Mongolia with a loan of more than one hundred million rubles for the construction of the coal mine.
    In 1955, hundreds of Chinese workers came here and helped build ground facilities according to the agreement between the two countries. The beautiful coal mine building in front of us and the construction of dozens of workers' dormitories were all undertaken by them. Now, these buildings are rising one by one from the grassland, and the workers' dormitories composed of thirty-odd buildings occupy tens of thousands of square meters of the original desolate grassland. These new houses, like the buildings in the Mongolian capital, are painted in beautiful colors on the outside, reflecting the blue clear sky. From a distance, it is a beautiful new mining village.
    The director led us to visit the upper floor of the coal mine building. This is the workers' bathroom, which occupies almost an entire floor. The inner room has shower stalls and faucets, and the outside is a locker for clothes. Each room is uniform in style and well-equipped.
    The underground project has not been fully completed. However, the director gave us an opportunity to visit and led us down the mine. We changed into moisture-proof clothes for going down the mine, put on safety helmets, and took a skip down the mine in batches.
    The mine is more than one hundred meters deep. The electric lights in the mine have not been installed yet, but the miner's lamps carried by each person can make things clear. At the bottom of the well, there are countless horizontal channels radiating inward. These are transportation lanes, and the rails have been laid. We walked along the rails towards a horizontal lane. The roadway was wide and high, and the walls were plastered with cement. Along the way, we could encounter workers pushing cars loaded with soil towards us at any time. The lights illuminated each other's faces, and everyone greeted each other kindly.
    Working in the mine are Mongolian workers, as well as Soviet comrades and Chinese workers. They have formed a deep friendship in their work. At the end of a lane, workers were digging soil. A Soviet comrade, acting as a technical guide, asked the workers to use an automatic excavator to dig soil for us to see. The Mongolian workers skillfully operated the machine, fully excavating a car of soil. In another lane, we met Chinese workers. The Ma Defu team here completed an outstanding task before our National Day, advancing fifty-two meters in one month, which was about twenty meters more than the usual depth. Speaking of this, Comrade Director expressed great satisfaction. This mine is about to be connected to the transportation lane of another mine. The Mongolian workers on that side are extending towards here, and the Chinese workers on this side are advancing towards the other side. When they are connected, they will also hold a meeting in the mine.
    The underground passages are winding and turning, and we can't even tell the direction as we walk. The transportation lane has not yet reached the coal seam, and we have not seen the coal, but the director said that we are welcome to visit again when it is put into production.
    Coming up from the mine, we noticed a towering large iron tower on the No. 1 well. This was installed by Chinese workers with the help of Soviet engineers. The workers were not originally in this industry, but thanks to the guidance of experts, they finally completed it. For this, the mine also held a celebration meeting for them.
    The director told us that the coal mine has reserves of more than 40 million tons, and the designed capacity of this pair of vertical shafts is 600,000 tons per year. In this way, this coal mine can be mined for about seventy years.
    What is the progress of the coal mine project currently? To answer this question, Comrade Danbadarja, who is responsible for the production plan, and a Soviet expert led us to the office and told us that the entire mine project is divided into three parts. The current situation is: 84.3% of the mine shaft part has been completed, 94.3% of the construction part, and 81.6% of the installation part. The materials used for the construction of the entire mine, just the rebar and steel, amounted to 3,000 tons, and 10,000 tons of cement, all of which were transported from the Soviet Union. Now, the workers are working actively to strive for completion by the end of this year.
    The Mongolian workers who are working in this modern coal mine have grown up under the training of Soviet experts, and they have gradually mastered production technology. Danbadarja told us that the new miners are trained in three ways: Soviet experts teach the workers to master technology while working by the method of apprenticeship; in addition, short-term training courses are held in the coal mine, and experts guide the study; the third method is to send interns to Soviet coal mines for production internships every year. In this way, more than one thousand Mongolian miners who are needed for production have been trained, and by the time it is officially put into production, the technicians who operate more than two hundred machines will also be trained.
    Walking out of the coal mine building, we lingered and circled around the mining area. The atmosphere of intense work and the fraternal friendship of common cooperation among the workers of the three countries left us with a deep and unforgettable impression.

　　建设中的友谊煤矿
　　本报记者　彭逢烨
    我们已经两次去过那来河煤矿了，这个蒙古目前最大的煤矿——友谊的煤矿，变化真快，一年一个样子，不久就要正式投入生产了。
    去年冬天，在下雪的日子里，我们第一次到了这里。建设中的煤矿基地被白雪掩盖着，在零下二、三十度的严寒里，工人们一个劲的劳动着。那时，煤矿管理局局长冈布扎布同志在一间临时的办公室里接待了我们。这个屋子不大，挤满了人，大家满有兴致的听他按着一张草图讲解这个矿的过去和未来。那时，正在往地下挖掘一对新的竖井，我们还只能在地上参观一些附属工程。
    今年的冬天来得迟些，但是地势较高的那来河早就降雪了。我们在煤矿工程就要结束的初冬，又一次访问了它。
    那来河煤矿在乌兰巴托的东边，距离四十多公里，有一条窄轨铁路连接蒙古首都。这是蒙古最早修筑的一条铁路，是那来河的运煤专用线。我们沿着这条铁路坐汽车前行，在右边，另一条宽轨铁路蜿蜒在草原上，那就是连接蒙、中、苏三国首都的“友谊铁路”。新建的煤矿已修筑了专用线连接这条干线，准备把煤运往首都，原来的窄轨铁路已经担负不了这运输任务了。
    夹在两条铁路中间的公路，也正在翻修。其中的一段柏油路和一座公路大桥的兴建工程，是中国援助蒙古的建设项目，中国工人们在不停地施工。
    那来河煤矿，早在蒙古人民革命胜利前就有人作过零星开采，革命胜利后，煤矿属于国家所有，曾经用人工和部分机械开采，供给人民使用。由于蒙古城市建设和工业生产的发展，需要煤的数量也逐步增多，于是，在苏联专家的帮助下，经过勘测设计，从1955年起开始在这里兴建一对自动化的煤矿竖井，这就是现在我们要参观的煤矿。
    整个煤矿的建设过程，充分体现了社会主义国家相互帮助的兄弟情谊。煤矿从勘测、设计、施工到安装，各项工程都是在苏联专家的直接帮助下进行的，全套设备也是苏联供应的，苏联为此贷给蒙古一亿多卢布，作为兴建煤矿的费用。
    1955年，几百个中国工人来到这里，他们根据两国协议，帮助修建地面工程。眼前这个漂亮的煤矿大楼和几十幢职工宿舍的建筑工程，都交由他们兴建。现在，这些楼房一座座的从草原上升起来了，三十几座楼房组成的职工宿舍，占据了原来荒凉草原的几万平方公尺面积。这些新房，像蒙古首都的楼房一样，外表都涂着美丽的颜色，映着蓝色的晴空，远远看去，真是一座漂亮的矿工新村。
    局长领我们在煤矿大楼的上层参观。这是工人们的洗澡间，几乎占去一层楼，里屋按着淋浴斗篷水龙头，外边是放衣服的柜子，每间的样式一律，设备很周全。
    井下工程还没有全部完工。但是局长给我们一个参观的机会，领我们下矿井去。我们换过防湿的下井衣服，带上保险帽子，便分批坐滑车往井下去。
    矿井深一百几十公尺，井下的电灯还没有装好，凭着每个人携带着的矿工用灯也能看个明白。井底四周有无数横道向里边辐射，这是运输道，铁轨已经铺设好了。沿着铁轨我们向一条横道走去，巷道又宽又高，道壁涂着水泥。在途中，随时可以遇到工人们推着装土的车子迎面而来，灯光照见彼此的面孔，大家亲切地互相招呼。
    在井下工作的有蒙古工人，还有苏联同志和中国工人。他们在工作中结成了深厚的友谊。在一个巷道的顶端，工人们正在挖土，作为技术指导的苏联同志，让工人们用自动掘土机挖土给我们看，蒙古工人们熟练地操纵着机器，满满地掘起一车土来。在另一个巷道里，我们遇见了中国工人。在这里的马得福小组，在我国国庆节前完成了一项出色的任务，他们在一个月内打进五十二公尺，比平常的深度多了二十公尺左右，说起这件事来，局长同志表示很满意。这个矿井就要和另一个井的运输道连接起来了，在那边的蒙古工人往这里伸延，这边的中国工人向对方前进，打通的时候，他们还要在井下会师呢。
    地下道曲曲弯弯的，走着走着我们连方向也分辨不清了。运输道还没有接着煤层，我们未看到煤，但是局长表示投入生产的时候，欢迎我们再去参观。
    走上井来，我们注视到一号井上的一座高耸的大铁塔，这是在苏联工程师的帮助下，由中国工人安装的。工人们原来不是做这一行的，但是由于专家的指导，终于完工了。为此，矿里还为他们举行了一个庆祝会。
    局长告诉我们说，煤矿的蕴藏量达四千多万吨，这一对竖井的设计能力，每年能够开采六十万吨。这样，这个煤矿可以开采七十年左右。
    目前，煤矿工程的进度怎样呢？为了回答这个问题，负责生产计划的丹巴达尔加同志和一位苏联专家，把我们领到办公室里，告诉我们说，全矿工程分三个部分，到现在完成的情况是：矿井部分已完成84.3％，建筑部分94.3％，安装部分81.6％。全矿建设所用的材料，仅钢筋、钢材就达三千吨，水泥一万吨，都是从苏联运来的。现在，工人们正积极劳动，争取今年年底完工。
    在这个现代化的煤矿里劳动着的蒙古工人，是在苏联专家培养下成长起来的，他们已经逐步地掌握了生产技术。丹巴达尔加告诉我们，新生的矿工是从三个方面来培养的：苏联专家们用带徒弟的办法，一边工作，一边就教会工人们掌握技术；另外，在煤矿开办短期训练班，由专家指导学习；第三个办法是每年派实习生到苏联的煤矿去进行生产实习。就这样，已经培养了生产需要的一千多名蒙古矿工，到正式投入生产时，操纵两百多台机器的技术人员也都培养起来了。
    走出煤矿大楼，我们留恋地在矿区四周回巡，这里洋溢着紧张工作的气氛，洋溢着的三国职工共同协作的兄弟情谊，给我们留下了深刻难忘的印象。
