    Stomach Warming Bag

    The weather is getting colder, and comrades with chronic stomach problems will experience stomach pain with the slightest exposure to cold or careless eating. Patients who apply a "stomach warming bag" have greatly suppressed their stomach pain. We have been trying this stomach warming bag for more than a year, and its effect is good, so we are introducing it here.

    The method of making a stomach warming bag is very simple: take 1.4 feet of white cloth, cut according to the style and size of the attached diagram (can be appropriately reduced or enlarged according to individual physique), then spread an appropriate amount of cotton, scatter a small amount of Chinese medicine powder on the cotton, put it in the bag and sew it up. The medicine in the bag should be changed every two weeks.

    The Chinese medicine prescription is as follows: 1 qian of cloves, 1 qian and 5 fen of galangal, 1 qian and 5 fen of pepper, 1 qian and 5 fen of cinnamon, ground into fine powder. (Yan An)

    胃暖袋
    天气越来越冷，老胃病的同志稍一受凉或饮食不慎就会引起胃痛。患者敷用“胃暖袋”后，胃痛都大大的抑止了。这种胃暖袋，我们已经试用了一年多，它的效果是良好的，所以介绍出来。
    胃暖袋的做法很简便：取白布1.4尺，照附图样式和尺寸裁剪（根据个人体格可适当缩小或放大一些），然后铺上适量的棉花，把中药末少许散在棉花上，装进袋内缝起即成。袋内的药，两周换一次。
    中药的配方如下：丁香1钱、高良姜1钱5分、胡椒1钱五分、官桂1钱5分，磨成细粉末。（晏安）
