Xinhua News Agency reported that pastoral areas such as Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Gansu are steadily carrying out the movement of mutual aid and cooperation in animal husbandry. As of the end of October this year, these four regions had established 1,763 livestock production cooperatives, with member herdsmen accounting for more than 23% of the total number of households in pastoral areas; at the same time, 9,469 mutual aid groups of various types have been developed, laying the foundation for establishing cooperatives. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has 1,078 livestock cooperatives, with member households accounting for 40.48% of the total number of livestock households. On the Inner Mongolia grasslands, 85.7% of herdsmen are now participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations.

The livestock production cooperatives in various regions have demonstrated great superiority in developing production. This year, the grasslands have suffered from varying degrees of drought, floods, or livestock epidemics, but the livestock of the vast majority of livestock cooperatives have still increased. Most cooperatives have enabled 80% to 90% of their members to increase their income and improve their lives. In areas where natural disasters were more severe, the losses of livestock cooperatives were much smaller than those of herdsmen outside the cooperatives. According to a survey of eight cooperatives in Haibei and Haixi Autonomous Prefectures of Qinghai Province, the average production of livestock cooperatives increased by 57.84% compared to last year. The highest increase was in the Sujitan No. 5 Cooperative in Menyuan County, which increased by 105%, and the lowest increase was also more than 33%. Among the 119 cooperative members in the eight cooperatives, 115 households increased their income, of which 11 households increased their income by more than 100%. The Defuxilite Cooperative had an average net income of 1,158 yuan per household, with the household that received the most receiving 3,050 yuan, and the household that received the least receiving 537 yuan.

Livestock cooperatives in various regions have generally improved their livestock breeding management and grazing methods. They uniformly manage livestock, implement grazing in separate groups and combined groups according to species, size, male and female, strength and weakness, assign dedicated personnel to be responsible, and use grasslands in a planned way according to different seasons. Many livestock cooperatives have focused on breeding and lambing, preventing and controlling livestock epidemics, and actively building sheds and repairing pens to ensure that large livestock have pens and small livestock have sheds; at the same time, they have stored a large amount of fodder for winter and spring. Therefore, they have enhanced their ability to resist natural disasters and greatly increased the net growth rate of livestock.

The development of the movement of mutual aid and cooperation in animal husbandry is prompting the broad masses of herdsmen to gradually change their nomadic lives of moving with the water and grass. Members of many livestock cooperatives have built houses, dug wells, and built canals on the grasslands, building their own homes. The livestock mutual aid and cooperation organizations in Inner Mongolia also planted 1.2 million mu of feed crops this year, which can harvest 10 million jin of grain feed, which has never happened on the grasslands before. In the Altai and other historically grain-deficient pastoral areas of Xinjiang, many livestock cooperatives have implemented settled residence and engaged in agricultural production concurrently. Now, they are not only self-sufficient in grain, but also have surpluses. Some livestock cooperatives in Qinghai are also trying to plant pasture and vegetables in settled areas, preparing to establish feed bases. The implementation of settled nomadic life by livestock cooperatives in various regions has not only provided better living conditions for the elderly, pregnant women, and children, but is also conducive to carrying out cultural studies. Now, many reading groups, literacy classes, and primary schools have appeared in various pastoral areas, and some livestock cooperatives have also established clubs, libraries, and maternal and child health stations, etc., which have attracted the attention of the broad masses of herdsmen.

### 稳步开展畜牧业互助合作运动  广大牧民由游牧生活逐步定居

    稳步开展畜牧业互助合作运动
    广大牧民由游牧生活逐步定居
    据新华社讯　内蒙古、新疆、青海和甘肃等牧区，正在稳步地开展畜牧业互助合作运动。截至今年10月底，这四个地区已经建立了一千七百六十三个牧业生产合作社，入社牧民占牧区总户数23％以上；同时发展了九千四百六十九个各种类型的互助组，为办社打下基础。新疆维吾尔自治区已有一千零七十八个牧业社，入社牧户占总牧户40.48％。在内蒙古草原上，现在有85.7％的牧民参加了互助合作组织。
    各地牧业生产合作社在发展生产方面，显示了巨大的优越性。今年草原上遭到不同程度的旱、涝或畜疫等灾害，但绝大多数牧业社的牲畜仍有增加，多数社使80％到90％的社员增加收入，改善了生活。在自然灾害比较严重的地方，牧业社的损失也比社外牧民小得多。据青海省海北、海西两个自治州八个社的调查，牧业社平均比去年增产57.84％，最高的亹源县苏吉滩五社增产105％，最低的社也增产33％以上。八个社的一百一十九户社员有一百一十五户增加收入，其中十一户增加收入一倍以上。德夫西里特社平均每户净得一千一百五十八元，分得最多的户是三千零五十元，分得最少的户也达五百三十七元。
    各地牧业社在牲畜饲养管理和放牧方法上普遍有了改进。他们对牲畜统一经营，按种类、大小、公母、壮弱实行分群放牧和合群放牧，固定专人负责，并且根据不同季节有计划地使用草场。许多牧业社抓紧了配种接羔、防治畜疫等工作，还积极搭棚修圈，作到大畜有圈，小畜有棚；同时大量贮备过冬过春的饲草。因此，增强了抗御自然灾害的能力，大大提高牲畜的纯增率。
    畜牧业互助合作运动的发展，正在促使广大牧民逐步改变逐水草而居的游牧生活。许多牧业社的社员们在草原上盖房舍、打井、修渠，建设了自己的家园。内蒙古的畜牧业互助合作组织，今年还种植了一百二十万亩饲料作物，可以收获一千万斤粮食饲料，这是草原上从来没有过的事。在新疆的阿勒泰等历史上缺粮的牧区，很多牧业社实行定居兼营农业生产，现在粮食不但自给自足，还有余存。青海有些牧业社也正在定居地试种牧草、蔬菜，准备建立饲料基地。各地牧业社实行定居游牧以后，不仅使老人、孕妇、儿童有了较好的生活条件，还有利于开展文化学习。现在，各牧区出现了许多读报组、识字班和小学校，有些牧业社还设立了俱乐部、图书室和妇幼保健站等等，吸引了广大牧民的注意。（附图片）
