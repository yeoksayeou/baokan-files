Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 4th: The heroic deeds of the Da Shan Agricultural Cooperative in Junan County, Shandong Province, which, with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountain, split ridges, filled gullies, and led water up the mountain to change the impoverished face of the mountainous area, have become a good example for agricultural cooperatives in the Linyi Special Zone where the cooperative is located.

Since November, the Da Shan Cooperative has received more than 15,000 visitors from the Yimeng Mountain area, the Lunan Plain, and the eastern coastal areas.

After visiting, these county, district, township, and cooperative cadres have increased their confidence in doing a good job in winter production and increasing crop yields. Li Xisi, the Party branch secretary of the Li Guanzhuang Township in Mengyin County, originally had no confidence in completing the plan to produce an average of 400 jin of grain per mu next year. After visiting and learning from the experience of the Da Shan Cooperative, he believed that the 400-jin grain production plan could not only be completed but also greatly exceeded. Yang Xuelin of the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Cangshan County always thought that the disaster situation this year was serious and that winter production would not be easy to carry out before the visit. Now this view has also changed, and he plans to add another 900 mu of deep plowing and ten water wells. People who originally doubted the achievements of the Da Shan Cooperative are now completely convinced. Wei Jianting, a model agricultural laborer in Cangshan County, said before the visit that the Da Shan Cooperative has "three mountains and five ridges and two rivers," while we have "nine ridges, two rivers, and eight gullies." Their conditions are better than ours, and such deeds are not rare. Now he feels that he is a laggard and said that he will mobilize the masses well after returning to the cooperative and catch up.

When leaving, the visitors always said excitedly that the Da Shan Cooperative is a good school for promoting the great leap forward in production.

　　山东许多农业社派人参观大山社
    新华社临沂4日电  山东省莒南县大山农业社以愚公移山劲头，劈岭填沟引水上山，改变山区贫瘠面貌的英雄事迹，已成为这个社所在的临沂专区各农业社学习的好榜样。
    11月以来，大山社已经接待了来自沂蒙山区、鲁南平原和东部沿海地区的一万五千多名前来参观访问的客人。
    这些县、区、乡、社干部经过参观访问后，对搞好冬季生产，提高农作物产量增强了信心。蒙阴县李官庄乡支部书记李锡泗，原来对完成明年平均每亩产粮食四百斤的计划没有信心，在参观并学习了大山社的经验后，认为四百斤的产粮计划不仅可以完成，而且可以大大超过。苍山县前进农业社杨学林在未参观前，总认为今年灾情重，冬季生产不好开展，现在这种看法也改变了，准备再增加九百亩深翻地和十眼水井。原来对大山社成绩抱怀疑的人，现在已口服心服了。苍山县农业劳动模范魏建亭，参观前曾说大山社有三山五岭两条河，我们是九岭两河八道沟，他们的条件比我们好，那样的事迹不稀罕；现在却觉得自己是个落伍者，表示回社后好好发动群众，迎头赶上。
    参观的人们在临走时，总是激动地说大山社是一所推进生产大跃进的好学校。
