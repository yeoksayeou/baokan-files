　　Shenyang Farm Implement Factory Trial-Produces a Batch of New Products
　  Fertilizer Spreaders and Potato Planters Will Appear in the Motherland's Fields
    (Our Dispatch) The Shenyang Farm Implement Factory is designing twelve new types of agricultural machinery; of the thirty-six new products proposed by the First Ministry of Machine Building for trial production nationwide next year, six are here. Among the twelve new products trial-produced by this factory, the design work for five new products, including a 120-row tractor-drawn harrow, a livestock-powered ten-row notched paddy field harrow, a fertilizer spreader, a ten-meter tractor-drawn harrow, and a ten-horsepower gas engine, is nearing completion.
    The design of the fertilizer spreader is basically complete, based on measurements taken from the latest model of fertilizer spreader from Czechoslovakia. It resembles a sprinkler truck in appearance, and the spreading width reaches five meters. This machine spreads fertilizer much more evenly than manual spreading. The newly designed 120-disc tractor-drawn harrow has a width of 16.6 meters, which can increase efficiency three times compared to a 41-disc tractor-drawn harrow. Among these new products, the potato planter is something that China has not manufactured in the past. It is designed in imitation of the Soviet potato planter. With this machine, three people working for a day can plant eight hectares of potatoes, and it's square planting. Currently, square planting of potatoes in our country requires five people, two horses, and a cultivator; even then, they can only plant one hectare a day.
    The ten-horsepower gas engine, which the factory independently designed based on the specific situation of a lack of power in rural areas, has already had some drawings put into production. This machine burns for eight hours on a single filling of coal, and only uses more than 300 jin of coal every ten hours. It can also burn coke or hardwood firewood.
    In order to do a good job in the design and trial production of these twelve new products, the factory has transferred technical personnel and established a trial production workshop.

　　沈阳农具厂试制一批新产品
　  祖国原野上将出现撒肥车和土豆播种机
    本报讯　沈阳农具厂正在设计十二种新式农业机械；第一机械工业部提出的明年全国试制的三十六种新产品，在这里就有六种。这个厂试制的十二种新产品当中，一百二十行机引耙、畜力十行缺口水田耙、撒肥车、十米机引耙、十马力煤气机等五种新产品的设计工作已经接近收尾。
    撒肥车的设计已经基本完成，这是根据捷克斯洛伐克最新型号的撒肥车测绘的。外形和洒水车相似，撒肥的宽度达五公尺，用这种机器比人力扬粪要均匀得多。新设计的一百二十片的机引耙的宽度为十六点六公尺，比起机引四十一片耙来，效率可提高三倍。在这些新产品里，土豆播种机是我国过去没有制造过的，这是模仿苏联的土豆播种机设计的，用这台机器，三个人工作一天，就可以播种八垧地土豆，而且是方形播种。目前我国方形播种土豆，需要五个人、两匹马、一个铲趟机；这样一天也只能播种一垧。
    这个厂根据目前农村缺乏动力的具体情况自行设计的十马力煤气机，部分图纸已经投入生产。这种机器添一次煤就烧八小时，每十小时用煤量才三百多斤，而且烧焦炭也行，烧硬木柴也行。
    这个厂为了做好这十二种新产品的设计和试制工作，已经抽调技术人员，成立了试制工段。
