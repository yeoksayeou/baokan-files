    Six Units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences are Unhygienic
    Residents' Committee Posts Big-Character Poster Criticizing Them
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Zujia Street Residents' Committee in Beijing posted a big-character poster criticizing six units, including the Material Supply Bureau of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, for being unhygienic.
    The Material Supply Bureau, Administrative Bureau, Institute of Psychology, Institute of Minority Languages, Yellow River Exploration Team, and Information Research Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences are all located in Duanwangfu Alley, Xisi District. The sanitation of these units has been poor for several years, and nearby residents have many complaints. This year, the Xisi District Patriotic Health Campaign Committee inspected the area twice and criticized them. After the launch of the Beijing winter "Eliminate the Four Pests and Promote Hygiene" campaign, the Residents' Committee sent people to inspect on December 14th and found garbage and sputum everywhere. Eight rooms were inspected and found to be in a chaotic state, with many people not making their beds, and piles of smelly socks and shirts on the beds. Some people even put bowls, chopsticks, and shoes together. The cooks were also unclean, with long fingernails, and their white clothes were almost black. There were rat holes in the kitchen, but no rat-catching tools, and the vegetable basins were covered in dirt. The Residents' Committee made a severe criticism after the inspection. However, these units paid no attention to it. When the Residents' Committee visited again on December 16th and 23rd, the situation remained the same.
    On December 24th, the Residents' Committee posted a big-character poster at the entrance of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, demanding that they quickly change this unhygienic situation.

    科学院六单位不讲卫生
    居民委员会贴大字报批评
    本报讯　北京祖家街居民委员会贴大字报，批评中国科学院器材局等六个单位不讲卫生。
    中国科学院所属的器材局、管理局、心理研究所、少数民族语言研究所、黄河勘探队和情报研究室等六个单位，都设在西四区端王府夹道。这个机关的卫生状况几年来一直不好，附近居民很有意见。今年西四区爱国卫生运动委员会曾两次去那里检查，对他们提出批评。北京市冬季“除四害、讲卫生”运动开展后，居民委员会在12月14日派人检查，见院里还是到处是垃圾和痰。查了八个房间，也都乱七八糟，很多人不叠被，床上臭袜子、臭衬衣一大堆。有的人甚至把碗、筷和鞋袜放在一起。炊事员也不干净，指甲很长，白衣服穿得快成黑的了。厨房里有鼠洞，但没有扑鼠工具，菜盆上土也不少。居民委员会检查后，又提出严厉批评。但这些机关还是不理会。到12月16日和23日居民委员会去看时，情况照旧，一点没动。
    24日居民委员会在科学院门口贴了张大字报，要求他们赶快改变这种不卫生状况。
