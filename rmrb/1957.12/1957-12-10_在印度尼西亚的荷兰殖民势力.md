　　Dutch Colonial Forces in Indonesia
　　Liang Shu
    Indonesia is currently engaged in a large-scale struggle to reclaim West Irian, with workers employed by Dutch enterprises staging a general strike and the Indonesian government taking over some Dutch businesses. This demonstrates the strong will of the Indonesian people to firmly uphold national independence and sovereignty and oppose Dutch colonial forces.

    For many years, the reason Dutch imperialism has been able to occupy a not-insignificant position among capitalist countries is largely due to its exploitation of the Indonesian people. Before World War II, income from Dutch investments in Indonesia accounted for 14% of its total national income. The dividends paid by the Dutch East India Company during its existence were 36 times its capital (6.5 million guilders). To date, the total foreign capital in Indonesia amounts to 63 billion guilders, of which Dutch capital accounts for 63.5%, reaching 40 billion guilders. According to last year's estimates, the annual profit of foreign capital is 25%, or 15 billion guilders. This amount is equal to the total revenue stipulated in last year's Indonesian national budget.

    According to materials from the "Indonesian National United Bank" in 1956, there are eight foreign banks in Indonesia with a total capital of approximately 650 million guilders, of which Dutch capital accounts for 75%. In addition, five major foreign firms occupy a monopolistic position in Indonesia's economic life.

    In terms of agricultural enterprises, the majority of arable land is occupied by plantations owned by foreign monopolistic organizations. Dutch capital holds the largest power, with an investment of approximately 24 billion guilders, owning 669 plantations with a total area of over 1.1 million hectares. Of the more than 300,000 tons of rubber produced by foreign-funded plantations in 1953, the Dutch "Amsterdam Trading Company" alone accounted for more than 85,000 tons.

    In the mining industry, Indonesia's mining industry mainly involves the extraction of oil and tin, with investments of approximately 11.2 billion guilders. According to a 1954 report in the "Indonesian Torch" newspaper, Indonesia's annual exports of oil at that time amounted to 2 billion guilders in foreign exchange, but the Indonesian government only received 200 million guilders, with the rest going to foreign companies, most of which was obtained by the "Bataaf Petroleum Company" with Dutch and British capital. The "Billiton Joint Mining Company," jointly operated by Dutch capital and the Indonesian government, controls all tin production. One of the methods used by the Dutch to control tin production in Indonesia after the war was to not repair tin smelters and send the tin ore to the Netherlands and the United States for refining. According to experts, Indonesia loses at least 1 billion guilders annually in terms of tin prices through this method, while the Netherlands profits by 1 billion guilders as a result.

    Indonesia is a country composed of more than 3,000 islands. Inter-island shipping is of great significance. Currently, 70% of the transportation volume is controlled by the Dutch Royal Shipping Company. In Indonesia's ocean shipping business, the Dutch "Java Shipping Company," "Rotterdam Shipping Company," and "Netherlands Shipping Company" also occupy a monopolistic position.

    In terms of civil aviation, between 1945 and 1949, it was completely monopolized by "KLM Royal Dutch Airlines." In 1950, the Indonesian government and this company jointly formed "Garuda Indonesian Airways," but according to the agreement, "KLM Royal Dutch Airlines" could still obtain huge benefits and receive remuneration for providing "assistance" in technical aspects.

    Indonesia has 7,332 kilometers of railways. The railways formerly belonging to the Dutch colonial "government" have been nationalized, but more than 2,900 kilometers of railways still belong to Dutch capital and are operated by the Indonesian government railway bureau through rentals with huge amounts of funds. According to a report by Antara News Agency last year, the annual rent payment is 5 million Dutch guilders.

    After the war, American capital in Indonesia increased significantly. Before the war, American capital amounted to approximately US$210 million. Now, according to a report in the Jakarta "People's Daily," American investment has increased to US$350 million, second only to the Netherlands. Britain has retreated to third place. American capital is mainly invested in oil extraction, originally US$100 million, and recently increased by another US$80 million. Not long ago, "Texaco" also applied to the Indonesian government for permission to allow 500 "technical personnel" and "experts" to enter the country. American oil companies transport large quantities of crude oil produced back to the United States. In 1952, crude oil shipped to the United States reached 600,000 tons, and in the first eleven months of 1954, it increased to 1.6 million tons.

    Before the war, tin ore shipped to the United States accounted for 38%, but after the war, it increased to 60%. Including transshipments from the Netherlands to the United States, the total is 65%. In addition, iron vanadium soil and raw materials for aluminum production are also objects of American plunder.

    Last year, the US Department of Commerce expressed more interest in investing in Indonesia and published a document called "Investment in Indonesia" as promotional material for American investors.

    For many years, the United States has colluded with the Netherlands to engage in subversion and division activities in Indonesia, creating the "Republic of South Maluku" and the "Islamic State of Indonesia" conspiracies, attempting to rebuild colonial rule in Indonesia. The Netherlands dares to continue to forcibly occupy West Irian because it has the support of the United States. The United States abstained from voting on the West Irian issue in the UN General Assembly, but this cannot conceal this fact. Recently, the US State Department openly threatened the Indonesian government, saying that Indonesia's struggle against Dutch colonial forces would cause Indonesia to suffer the same "harm" as the Netherlands. This is a blatant act of interference in Indonesia's internal affairs, further exposing the true face of American support for Dutch colonialism.

    However, the Indonesian people's struggle to safeguard national independence cannot be intimidated by American and Dutch imperialism. As long as the Indonesian people are united, they will surely be able to recover West Irian, achieve the integrity of their territorial sovereignty, and achieve complete economic independence.

### 在印度尼西亚的荷兰殖民势力

　　在印度尼西亚的荷兰殖民势力
　　梁恕
    印度尼西亚正在展开声势浩大的收回西伊里安的斗争，荷兰企业雇用的工人举行总罢工，印度尼西亚政府接管了一些荷兰企业。这是印度尼西亚人民坚决维护民族独立主权、反对荷兰殖民势力的坚强意志的表现。
    多少年来，荷兰帝国主义所以能在资本主义国家当中占有一个不算小的地位，在极大的程度上是由于它吸吮着印度尼西亚人民的膏血。在第二次大战前，荷兰在印度尼西亚投资的收入占它国民收入总额的14％。东印度公司在它存在的期间所支付的股息等于它股本（六百五十万盾）的三十六倍。到目前为止，在印度尼西亚的全部外国资本共六百三十亿盾，其中荷兰资本占63.5％，达四百亿盾。据去年的估计，外国资本每年的利润是25％，即一百五十亿盾。这个数目等于去年印度尼西亚国家财政预算案所规定的总收入。
    据1956年“印度尼西亚民族联合银行”的材料，在印度尼西亚有八家外国银行约共有资本六亿五千万盾，其中荷兰的资本占75％。另外还有五大洋行在印度尼西亚经济生活中占有垄断地位。
    在农场企业方面，大部分的可耕地被外国垄断组织的种植场所占有。荷兰资本占有最大的势力，投资约二百四十亿盾，拥有六百六十九个种植场，总面积达一百一十多万公顷。1953年外资种植场生产的三十多万吨橡胶中，荷兰的“阿姆斯特丹商业公司”一家就占了八万五千多吨。
    矿业方面，印度尼西亚的矿业主要是石油和锡的开采，投资约达一百一十二亿盾。据1954年“印度尼西亚火炬报”的消息说，当时印度尼西亚每年输出的石油共达二十亿盾外汇，但印度尼西亚政府只获得二亿盾，其余都归外国公司所有，而其中大部分为荷英资本的“巴达夫石油公司”所得。由荷兰资本和印度尼西亚政府合营的“勿里洞联合矿业公司”控制着全部锡矿生产。战后荷兰控制印度尼西亚锡矿生产的方法之一，是不修复炼锡炉，把锡矿送到荷兰和美国去提炼。据专家估计，通过这种方法，印度尼西亚在锡价方面每年最少亏损十亿盾，而荷兰则由此获利十亿盾。
    印度尼西亚是一个由三千多个岛屿组成的国家。岛际航运具有重要意义。目前有70％的运输量，由荷兰皇家轮船公司所掌握。在印度尼西亚的远洋航运事业中，荷兰的“渣华轮船公司”、“鹿特丹轮船公司”、“荷兰轮船公司”等也占有垄断地位。
    民用航空方面，在1945至1949年间完全为“荷兰皇家航空公司”所垄断。1950年，印度尼西亚政府和这家公司合组“印度尼西亚鹰记航空公司”，但根据协定，“荷兰皇家航空公司”仍然可以取得巨大的利益，并因在技术方面提供“援助”而获得酬劳费。
    印度尼西亚有全长七千三百三十二公里的铁路，以前属于荷兰殖民“政府”的铁路已经收归国有，但仍有二千九百多公里的铁路属于荷兰资本，由印度尼西亚政府铁路局以巨额资金租来经营。据去年安塔拉通讯社报道，每年支付的租金达五百万荷盾。
    战后，美国资本在印度尼西亚有了显著的增加。战前美国资本约达二亿一千万美元，现在据雅加达“人民日报”的报道，美国的投资已增至三亿五千万美元，仅次于荷兰而占第二位。英国退居第三位。美国资本主要是投放在石油开采方面，原来是一亿美元，最近又增加了八千万美元。不久前“德士古石油公司”还向印度尼西亚政府申请允许五百名“技术人员”和“专家”入境。美国石油公司把生产出来的原油大量运回美国，1952年输往美国的原油达六十万吨，1954年的十一个月里面更增为一百六十万吨。
    战前锡矿输往美国的占38％，而战后已增加到60％。加上由荷兰转口到美国的，共为65％。此外铁钒土和制铝的原料也是美国掠夺的对象。
    去年美国商业部曾经表现了向印度尼西亚投资的更多的兴趣，发表了一份叫做“在印度尼西亚的投资”的文件，作为向美国投资家宣传鼓吹的资料。
    美国多年来一直同荷兰串通一气，在印度尼西亚从事颠复和分裂活动，制造“南摩鹿加共和国”和“印度尼西亚伊斯兰国”阴谋，企图在印度尼西亚重建殖民统治。荷兰敢于继续强占西伊里安，就是由于得到美国的支持。美国在联大表决西伊里安问题时弃权，并不能掩盖这个事实。最近美国国务院又公然威胁印度尼西亚政府说，印度尼西亚反对荷兰殖民势力的斗争将使印度尼西亚受到同荷兰所受到的同样的“伤害”，这是干涉印度尼西亚内政的明目张胆行为，进一步暴露了美国支持荷兰殖民主义的真面目。
    但是，印度尼西亚人民维护民族独立的斗争是美、荷帝国主义所吓不倒的。只要印度尼西亚人民团结一致，他们必然能够收回西伊里安，取得领土主权的完整，并且在经济上取得完全的独立。
