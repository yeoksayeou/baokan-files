New Uses for Manure
By our reporter Cao Baoming

Using Manure to Replace Petroleum

A few days before the Spring Festival, the intermediate study group of the Central-South Building Materials Experiment Institute was studying the documents of the Communist Party's "Eighth National Congress." Several places in the documents mentioned that China's oil production was not high, and that the oil industry should be vigorously developed in the future. Naturally, technician Liu Ping said:

"Is there a way to increase oil production and supply it to the countryside? My relatives from the countryside say that besides big meetings, they lack oil for lighting at night for study sessions and small meetings."

"The oil problem can be solved," Engineer Jiang Zigang immediately replied.

"How to solve it?"

"Use manure to replace petroleum!"

Manure can replace petroleum? Unexpectedly, forty-two-year-old engineer Jiang Zigang would joke like this. Everyone laughed for a while, and then it passed.

However, two nights later, Hu Taishan, an administrative cadre who had studied chemistry, asked Engineer Jiang: "You said the other day that you could use manure to replace petroleum, is that true? What's the basis for that?"

A Twenty-Year-Old Experience

"Of course, it's true." Jiang Engineer then talked about an experience from twenty years ago: In 1936, he was studying at the Zhen De Senior Industrial School at the Daye Lime Kiln. There were no electric lights in the town, and it was very inconvenient to study at night. At this time, a Japanese student named Weng who had studied abroad set up a "Natural Gas Training Institute" in Hankou and advertised in the newspaper: "Use cattle and horse manure to light lamps." The school sent him and a classmate named Chen to study. Sure enough, methane gas (biogas) could be drawn from a closed manure pond to light lamps, and the lamp head was similar to an ordinary gas lamp. In three months, Mr. Weng only taught them general operations and did not explain the principle of manure producing methane. In particular, some "medicine powder" had to be mixed into the first cell of manure to produce biogas, but Mr. Weng always refused to say what these "medicine powder" were called, and only wanted them to pay him to buy it, at several yuan a bottle. However, after the school used this method, one manure pond lit more than 30 lamps, and only one lamp was needed for a classroom of twenty or thirty people. They usually just occasionally added some fresh manure and used it until the Japanese invasion of Hubei in 1938. For the next twenty years, Jiang Zigang, who studied civil engineering, always worked in the city and didn't pay attention to this matter. Hu Taishan said:

"Now it's different from the old society. The puppet government didn't think about the peasants and didn't pay attention to this matter. Now the countryside has realized cooperation, and it is going to further realize agricultural modernization. If this method can be used in the countryside, it must be very good."

They immediately went to Liu Ping to discuss it. The three of them were determined to solve the fuel problem for lighting and power in the countryside and serve rural construction.

"Strongly Support, Handle Seriously"

However, after they found the principle of manure producing methane gas from "Brewing Science" and that the "medicine powder" added by Mr. Weng was baking soda, lime, and other alkaline substances, a problem arose: the experiment required funding and time! Their experiment institute was specializing in testing building materials, which was different in nature, and at the same time, the tasks were very heavy. What to do? The three of them discussed it for a long time and decided to write a letter to the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, asking the Provincial Committee for support.

Just over a week after their letter was sent, the General Office of the Provincial Committee replied with a letter: Your suggestion has been transferred to the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences for research. Please contact the Science Branch. When Jiang Zigang went to contact the Science Branch, the Science Branch had already replied to the Provincial Committee, believing that the suggestion had a scientific basis and agreed to the experiment. In early April, Li Shichun, deputy director of the Hubei Provincial Industrial Department's laboratory, personally came to them and said that the Provincial Committee wanted the Industrial Department to organize this experiment and asked them to draw up an experimental plan. When they drafted the plan and applied for 750 yuan in experimental funding, Director Xu of the Industrial Department immediately instructed: "Strongly support, handle seriously." and allocated the funds to the Central-South Building Materials Experiment Institute, asking them to manage it.

The support of the Party and the government encouraged everyone involved in this experiment. The work in the institute was very busy, so the concrete workers in the institute went to help them build the fermentation tank in the early morning, evening, and on Sundays. Jiang Zigang and Hu Taishan (Liu Ping had been transferred) also personally went to support the formwork, tie the rebar, and move bricks. After the pool was built, the Wuhan Military Region's Milk Farm sent them cow dung. On June 27, they struck a match, and the gas lamp fueled by biogas was lit. They immediately wrote a report to the Provincial Industrial Department, asking them to come and see, and prepared to do a power experiment.

"This is a Big Problem!"

As soon as the experiment started, they had a question: "The fertilizer is used for lighting, and there is no fertilizer for the fields. How to solve this contradiction?" Jiang Zigang had no solution either. Because in the past, they had always discharged the fermented manure as sewage. During the experiment, someone next to them said: "Farmers go to bed early and get up early. Having lights is good, but they can do without them. Spending hundreds of yuan to build such a pool and light a few lamps, the farmers may not welcome it." "This biogas lamp has been tried before, but no one has done it since. There must be a problem in it. Otherwise, it wouldn't be lost." Coincidentally, when they sent the experimental results to the Industrial Department, Li Shichun, who was responsible for this issue, was away on a business trip to the Northeast, and the matter was backlogged for more than a month without anyone taking care of it. The leaders of the experiment institute ordered them: "Make an experimental summary for the Industrial Department. If they want to continue the experiment, continue to do it; if they don't want to continue, then close the shop."

These questions, especially the contradiction between using it as fuel and agricultural fertilizer, how to solve it? Coincidentally, at this time, the Changjiang Daily published an article from the Soviet "Youth Technology" magazine entitled "Bioenergy Power Station." This article talked about using manure, weeds, dead branches, and other wastes to produce methane gas for power generation; the fermented organic fertilizer can also increase crop yields by 25%-30%.

Being able to generate electricity from manure and increase crop yields, the Soviet article gave their experimental work a broad vision and strengthened their confidence.

In early September, several directors of the Industrial Department came to see this experiment in person. Then, Wang Renzhong, the first secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee, and secretaries Zhang Pinghua, Zhao Xinchu, and Deputy Governor Liu Jisun all came.

When they heard that this work could solve the problem of power in the countryside and increase agricultural production, they all said: "This is a big problem!" Secretary Zhang Pinghua, who was in charge of the industrial front, also told Jiang Zigang: "The method is simple, and it solves the problem. We must strongly support it. What difficulties do you have? Raise them, and we will solve them immediately."

On September 6, the Hubei Provincial People's Committee invited Jiang Zigang and Hu Taishan to a meeting, and the directors of the Industrial Office and the Agricultural Office, the director of the Industrial Department, the director of the Agricultural Department, and the director of the Planning Commission all personally participated. At the meeting, the People's Committee decided to establish a special "Bioenergy Utilization Research Group" and allocate 30,000 yuan for large-scale experiments. With the strong support of the government, they used biogas to replace gasoline to start the water pump on October 14. On December 2, they also drove the generator, lit up the electric lights. The available nitrogen in the fermented manure was also increased by more than five times.

This experiment immediately aroused interest from all sides. Six special districts, four cities, and two counties in Hubei Province sent people to learn this technology and went back to start experiments, preparing to promote it. The Central Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Land Reclamation, the Ministry of Urban Services, and the Ministry of Chemical Industry all decided to send people to study it.

Preparing for Promotion in the Countryside

When the reporter visited the experimental site in mid-December, he met Cai Zhengyu, a farmer from the nearby Xingxing No. 1 Cooperative. As soon as the valve was opened, the gas lamp and the electric light came on one after another, the gas for boiling water was ignited, and the water pump outside the door sprayed out a stream of water. Cai Zhengyu heard that the gas drawn from this manure pond could boil a pot of water in fourteen minutes. He didn't quite believe it, so he took out a piece of paper and put it on the green flame. The paper immediately caught fire. When the valve was closed, the paper could not be lit. He immediately excitedly stroked the pipe guiding the biogas and asked a series of questions: "How much gas can be produced from a load of manure?" "How much gas can start the water pump?"...

Engineer Jiang told us: "Comrade Grelier from the Soviet Union sent us his unpublished manuscript, which systematized us theoretically and clarified the direction of further research. We are still studying three aspects of the problem: First, to study various data, such as how much biogas is generated by a certain amount of manure, etc. Second, Comrade Grelier's book says that the gas can be compressed in bottles to start cars and tractors. The Wuhan Oxygen Plant is preparing to do this experiment, so that the cost of installing pipes over long distances can be reduced. Third, to build various structures of fermentation tanks in Nanhu, using rammed earth instead of reinforced concrete, and using bamboo pipes instead of iron pipes and rubber pipes, so that the cost of basic construction can be further reduced, in order to promote it in the countryside."

    大粪有了新用途
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    用粪便代替石油
    春节前几天，中南建筑材料试验所的中级学习组，正在学习共产党的“八大”文件。文件中有几处提到我国石油产量不多，今后要大力发展石油工业。很自然，技术员刘平就谈到：
    “能不能想出个办法使石油产量增加，普遍供应农村？我的亲戚从乡里来说，农村除了开大会外，夜里学习和开小会，都缺油点灯。”
    “石油的问题可以解决。”工程师姜子钢马上应了一句。
    “怎么解决？”
    “用粪便代替石油！”
    粪便能代替石油？想不到四十二岁的工程师姜子钢还会这样开玩笑，大家嬉笑一阵便过去了。
    但是，两天后的晚上，学过化学的行政干部胡太山却去问姜工程师：“你前天说用粪便代替石油，是不是真的？有什么根据？”
    二十年前的一段经历
    “当然是真的。”姜工程师接着便谈了二十年前的一段经历：1936年，他在大冶石灰窑振德高级工业学校读书，镇上没有电灯，晚上自习很不方便。这时，有个姓翁的日本留学生在汉口办了个“天然瓦斯传习所”，并在报上登广告：“用牛马粪点灯”。学校就派他和姓陈的同学来学习。果然，在一个密闭的粪便池里，真能引出甲烷气体（沼气）来点灯，灯头跟普通的煤气灯差不多。三个月里，姓翁的只教给他们一般操作，不讲粪便产生甲烷的原理。特别是第一窖粪里要掺些“药粉”进去才能出沼气，而姓翁的始终不肯讲这些“药粉”叫什么名字，只要他们拿钱向他购买，好几元一瓶。不过，当学校用这办法后，一个粪池点了三十多盏灯，二三十人的教室只用一盏灯就行了。他们平常只是偶尔加点新鲜的粪便进去，便用到1938年日本进攻湖北为止。以后二十年中，学土木建筑的姜子钢始终在城市里工作，对这件事没在意。胡太山说道：
    “现在跟旧社会不同。伪政府没替农民着想，不注意这事。现在农村实现了合作化，又要进一步实现农业现代化，如果能将这个办法用在农村，一定很好。”
    他们马上去找刘平商量。三人决心要为农村解决照明和动力的燃料问题，为农村建设服务。
    “大力支持，认真办理”
    但是，当他们从“酿造学”中找到粪便产生甲烷气体的原理和姓翁的所掺的“药粉”是小苏打、石灰等碱性物质后，却发生了问题：试验需要经费和时间！他们试验所是专门试验建筑材料的，性质不一样，同时任务又很繁重。怎么办呢？他们三人商量了很久，决定写信给中共湖北省委，请省委支持。
    他们的信刚送走一个多星期，省委办公厅就回了一信：你们的建议已转中国科学院武汉分院研究。请你们同科学分院联系。当姜子钢去联系时，科学分院已回复省委了，认为建议有科学根据，同意试验。4月上旬，湖北省工业厅化验室副主任李士春亲自找他们来了，说省委要工业厅组织这次试验，请他们订个试验计划。当他们编出计划，申请七百五十元试验经费时，工业厅徐厅长马上批示：“大力支持，认真办理。”并将款拨给中南建筑材料试验所，请他们掌握。
    党和政府的支持鼓舞了参与这次试验的每一个人。所里的工作很忙，所里的混凝土工人便在一早一晚和星期天，去帮助他们修建发酵池。姜子钢和胡太山（刘平已调走）也亲自去支壳子板，扎钢筋和搬砖头。池子修好了，武汉军区牛奶场又送给了他们牛粪。6月27日，他们擦燃一根火柴，用沼气做燃料的气灯便点亮了。他们马上给省工业厅写了个报告，请他们来看看，并准备做动力试验。
    “这是个大问题！”
    试验刚开始，他们就发生了一个疑问：“肥料给照明用了，没肥田的了，这矛盾怎么解决？”姜子钢也没有办法。因为他们过去都是将发酵后的粪便当做污物排除掉了。在试验中，旁边又有人说：“农民早起早睡，有灯固然好，没灯也可以。搞几百块钱修这么个池子，点几盏灯，农民未必欢迎。”“这沼气灯过去有人搞过，以后又没人搞了，里面一定有问题。不然不会失传。”碰巧，他们送试验结果去工业厅时，负责这个问题的李士春出差去东北了，把事情积压了一个多月没人管。试验所的领导干部便吩咐他们：“做个试验总结给工业厅，他们如要继续试验，就继续做；如果他们不继续搞了，就收摊子。”
    这些问题，特别是做为燃料和农业肥料的矛盾问题，怎么解决？碰巧这时长江日报登了苏联“青年技术”杂志一篇题叫“生物能发电站”的文章。这篇文章谈到用粪便、杂草、枯树枝等废物制造甲烷气体来发电；发酵后的有机肥料还能提高农作物的收成25％—30％。
    能用大粪发电，还能提高农作物产量，苏联的文章给他们的试验工作提示了广大的远景，坚定了他们的信心。
    9月初，工业厅的几个厅长亲自来看这个试验了。接着，湖北省委第一书记王任重和书记张平化、赵辛初、副省长刘济荪都来了。
    当他们听说这个工作既能解决农村的动力问题，又能提高农业生产，都说：“这是个大问题！”分工领导工业战线的书记张平化还向姜子钢讲：“方法简单，又解决问题，我们要大力支持。你有什么困难？提出来，我们马上解决。”
    9月6日，湖北省人民委员会邀请姜子钢、胡太山去开会，工业办公室和农业办公室主任、工业厅长、农业厅长和计划委员会的主任都亲自参加了。会上，人委决定成立专门的“生物能利用研究组”，并拨款三万元进行大规模的试验。在政府的大力支持下，他们在10月14日就用沼气代替汽油，将抽水机发动了。12月2日，又将发电机带动了，亮起了电灯。发酵后的粪便的速效氮也提高了五倍多。
    这个试验立即引起了各方面的兴趣。湖北省六个专区、四个市和两个县都派人来学习这项技术，回去就着手试验，准备推广。中央农业部、农垦部、城市服务部、化工部都决定派人来研究。
    为在农村推广作准备
    记者12月中旬去试验现场参观的时候，正遇上附近的星星一社的农民蔡正余在那里。气门一开，气灯和电灯先后亮了，烧水的气体燃了，门外的抽水机就哗哗地喷出一股激水。蔡正余听说这粪便池里引出的气体能在十四分钟内烧开一壶水，有些不相信，拿出一张纸到绿色的火焰上去点，纸马上就着火了。当气门关闭后，纸就点不着了。他立刻兴致勃勃地抚摸着引导沼气的管子，提了一连串的问题：“一担粪能出多少气体？”“多少气体能发动抽水机？”……
    姜工程师告诉我们：“苏联格列尔同志将他尚未出版的著作手稿送来了，使我们在理论上系统化了，也明确了进一步研究的方向。我们还在研究三个方面的问题：一是研究出各种数据，如若干粪便发生多少沼气等等。二是格列尔同志的著作上讲，能将气体压缩在瓶内发动汽车和拖拉机，武汉制氧厂正准备来做这项试验，这样就能减少远距离的安装管子的费用。三是在南湖建设各种结构的发酵池，用三合土代替钢筋混凝土，用竹管代替铁管和胶管，使基本建设费用进一步降低，以便在农村中推广。”（附图片）
