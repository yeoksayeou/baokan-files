　　Culture Goes to the Countryside
　　Liu Feng
    Recently, some cadres who have been sent to the countryside have shown enthusiasm and a willingness to work hard in production. They are determined to improve production, learn agricultural techniques, and strive to temper and transform themselves through labor production. Although these comrades cannot match the villagers in production, they can take the initiative to take on heavy work, endure hardships, and have indeed developed some strength. Some cadres who have been sent down, not wanting to fall behind, have even engaged in competitions with commune members in labor production, comparing the quality and speed of their work. Some cadres who have been sent down have become known throughout the commune and township for their good work shortly after arriving, and their deeds are praised by everyone. On the part of the villagers, they are unwilling to let the cadres who have been sent down do heavy work, always assigning them lighter tasks and advising them to rest more, fearing that they will be overworked. They can be said to be extremely concerned, even more so than they are for their own children.

    The peasants are concerned about the health and progress of the cadres who have been sent down, but they also hope that the cadres will engage in some mental labor and contribute some culture and knowledge, whether in terms of political thought or commune business. For example, accounting work in the commune, medical work, literacy work, recreational activities, researching production techniques, water conservancy and irrigation, fertilizers, soil, as well as explaining the Forty Articles Program, assisting in rectifying the commune, the Party, and the League, writing rectification bulletins, conducting investigations and research, and organizing materials, etc. For these things, the cadres sent to the countryside should unreservedly cooperate with the commune members to do a good job in some mental labor, which is also an unavoidable responsibility.

    Since it is intellectual cadres who are being sent down, in addition to labor production, they should of course also give play to their own specialties, combine them with their original work, and contribute their culture and knowledge. It is not right for some comrades to emphasize that they are here for labor production and refuse the requests of the commune and peasants, unwilling to do the work that is within their capabilities and needed.

    If we combine the characteristics of the cadres who have been sent down and let everyone give full play to their strengths, this will make everyone feel more useful, and their knowledge and talents can be fully utilized. Only in this way can we truly improve relations with the masses and take root, blossom, and bear fruit among the masses. In this way, we will naturally understand the significance, joy, and prospects of production work in the countryside.

    The task of the cadres sent to the countryside is arduous and great. Everyone should not only provide support in agricultural production, but also bring culture and knowledge to the countryside, greatly expand cultural work in these areas, and create a surge of enthusiasm.

    We hope that the cadres sent to the countryside, on the premise of focusing on tempering and transforming themselves through labor production, will combine the urgent needs of the peasants and their own specialties to properly arrange work outside of production. In this way, they will not only be educated in labor production, but also temper and transform themselves by combining theory with practice, experiencing the knowledge and experience that is not found in books or learned in offices.

　　文化下乡
　　刘丰
    最近下放到农村的一些干部在生产上都比较热情肯干，都有决心搞好生产，学习农业技术，努力在劳动生产中锻炼和改造自己。这些同志虽然在生产上顶不上老乡，可是都能主动挑重活干，吃苦耐劳，力气也的确练出一把来了。有的下放干部不甘落后，在劳动生产上还和社员展开竞赛，比劳动的质量和速度。有的下放干部刚来不久就以劳动好而在全社全乡知了名，他们的事迹为大家颂扬。在老乡方面也都是不肯让下放干部干重活，总是挑轻便的活来分配，劝大家多休息，唯恐给累坏了。还安慰那些心急好强的同志，说：“我们也不是一两年干出来的。”真可以说是关心备至，超过了对自己子女的爱护。
    农民是关心下放干部的健康和进步的，可是农民却也希望下放干部搞一些脑力劳动，拿出一些文化和知识来，不管是政治思想方面的还是社里业务方面的。例如社里的会计工作，医务工作，扫盲工作，文娱活动，研究生产技术，水利灌溉、肥料、土壤，以及讲解四十条纲要，帮助整社、整党、整团，编写整风简报，作调查研究和整理材料等等的事。这些事，下乡的干部应该义不容辞地协同社员搞好一些脑力劳动，这也完全是无可逃避的责任。
    既然是知识分子干部下放，除劳动生产外当然也应发挥自己的特长，结合自己原来的业务，贡献出自己的文化和知识。有些同志一味地强调自己是来劳动生产的，拒绝社里和农民对自己的要求，不愿意做那些力所能及而又需要的工作，这就不对了。
    如果结合下放干部的特点，各展其所长，这就使大家更感到大有用武之地，自己的知识和才干，才可以充分发挥出来，也只有这样才能真正搞好和群众的关系，在群众中生根开花结果。这样自然也就会了解到在农村中生产工作的意义、乐趣和前途。
    下放干部的任务是艰巨而伟大的。大家不仅仅要做到在农业生产上的支援，而且要使文化和知识下乡，大大开展这些地区的文化工作，造成一个热潮。
    愿下放的干部，在以劳动生产锻炼改造为主的前提下，结合农民的迫切需要和自己的特长，好好安排一下生产以外的工作。这样就既在劳动生产中受到教育，又理论结合实际地锻炼和改造了自己，体会到书本上所没有，机关里学不到的知识和经验。
