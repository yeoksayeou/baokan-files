Dear Chinese Comrades!

On behalf of the 3.5 million members of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude for your kind invitation to attend the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, and offer my warm, comradely congratulations to this glorious congress.

As representatives from Asian countries have said, it is a fact that Japan and China have deep and inseparable ties, both historically and geographically.

Just look at each other's faces. Who is Chinese and who is Japanese? It's almost impossible to tell the difference.

And look at each other's languages. Although the pronunciation is different, the characters that form the basis of the languages are the same. Moreover, in terms of lifestyle, isn't it the same to eat rice with chopsticks? This is the result of the Japanese nation absorbing and developing Chinese culture.

In this way, China and Japan have many things in common, but there is one difference. As is well known, this is the difference in social systems. The former Japanese militarism oppressed you—our dear brothers—and caused you suffering.

Dear comrades! I have listened very carefully to your opinions from factories and mines. In your reports and opinions, there are sorrowful cries from people who have been tortured by militarists. When I heard those words, I was filled with apologies and, at the same time, when I thought that my current situation was the same as yours in the past, I felt infinite hatred for the militarists.

Please think about the situation of the Japanese workers who are suffering from the persecution of Japanese monopoly capital and are still fighting. From there, you will inevitably feel the mutual concern of workers that transcends national borders.

You have achieved a glorious social system through many difficult struggles. I feel the enthusiasm and vigor for New China on your faces. This is because you have built your own country with your own strength.

We Japanese workers, now groaning under the plunder of international and domestic monopoly capital, suffer from poor working conditions with a large number of unemployed, and fear "dead ashes."

This may seem incredible to people in your socialist country, but we are fighting against layoffs and against capitalists' movements to increase labor intensity and improve productivity. In order to break the shackles of labor conditions that are obviously harsh internationally and improve our lives, we are tirelessly fighting for wage increases, the establishment of a minimum wage system, and the recovery of the right to strike that has been deprived of civil servants and workers in public enterprises.

At the same time, in order to prevent the tragedy of the atomic bomb from happening again, we are also fighting against military bases in Sunagawa, Okinawa, and other places, and striving for peace.

Specifically, we are reorganizing our battle lines and preparing to launch a spring struggle between February and March next year, using large-scale strikes to confront monopoly capital.

Under these circumstances, we are paying attention to the development of socialism in your country and are willing to learn various experiences from it.

Therefore, we must continue to interact with each other.

It has become common sense that Japanese workers often pass through China when returning home from any country. This is formed by the close friendship with everyone in China and the enthusiasm to learn from China.

It is very difficult to invite Chinese guests to Japan. But in any case, as a result of the struggle of Japanese workers and people, the matter of inviting you to Japan is progressing successfully. Although it is near the end of the year, there are still five delegations, including a mechanical worker delegation, visiting Japan. We also plan to invite a Chinese coal miner delegation to visit Japan in January next year.

In this way, we believe that the great power of the struggle of Japanese workers and people will surely promote the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan.

Dear Chinese comrades! You have made great progress in the revolution and are embarking on the Second Five-Year Plan.

We believe that the cornerstone of socialism in your country is undoubtedly a great contribution to world peace and human happiness.

How much encouragement your progress is to the Japanese working class!

In this sense, we heartily congratulate your Eighth National Congress on achieving brilliant achievements through free and lively discussions.

Finally, I would like to once again thank you for your kind invitation to attend the conference, and in order to repay the significance of the solidarity of representatives from all countries, I shout:

Long live the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions!

Long live the friendship and unity of the workers and people of China and Japan!

Long live world peace and unity!

    日本工会总评议会副议长
    藤冈三男致词亲爱的中国同志们！
    我谨代表日本工会总评议会三百五十万会员，对你们邀请我们参加这次中国工会第八次全国代表大会的友谊，表示衷心的感谢，同时对这个光辉的大会，致以同志般的热烈的祝贺。
    正如亚洲各国代表所说，无论从历史上、从地理上来看，日本和中国之间都有着不能分离的深厚关系，这是事实。
    请看看彼此的面容，谁是中国人，谁是日本人，简直相像得分不清楚。
    再看看彼此的语言，发音虽然不同，但是成为语言基础的文字却是相同的。不仅如此，在生活方面，用筷子吃米饭，不也都是相同吗？这是日本民族吸取了中国文化而发展的结果。
    这样，本来中国和日本是有很多方面相同了，但是有一点不同，如所周知，这就是社会制度不同。已往的日本军国主义欺压你们——亲爱的兄弟，并使你们遭受苦难。
    亲爱的同志们！我对你们来自工厂和矿山的意见，十分注意地倾听了。在你们的报告和意见中，出现了被军国主义者折磨过的人们的悲痛呼声。我听到那些话的时候，真是充满了抱歉的心情，同时想到现在自己的处境是和你们从前一样的时候，感到对军国主义者无限的憎恨。
    请你们想一想在遭受着日本垄断资本的迫害，现在还在战斗着的日本工人的状况吧，从那里必然会感觉到工人那种超越国境的互相关怀。
    你们经过许许多多艰苦的斗争，取得了光辉的社会制度。我感觉你们的脸上有着对新中国的热情和朝气。这是因为你们是用自己的力量建设起来了自己的国家。
    我们日本工人，现在在国际的和国内的垄断资本的掠夺下，呻吟于拥有大量失业者的恶劣的劳动条件中，对“死灰”恐惧着。
    这在你们社会主义国家的人来看，也许是不可思议的，但是我们正在反对解雇，反对资本家的加强劳动强度的提高生产率运动。为了打破在国际上来说也显然是苛刻的劳动条件的桎梏，从而提高生活，我们不倦地进行着增加工资、制定最低工资制、夺回公务员和公共企业工人被剥夺的罢工权利的斗争。
    与此同时，我们为了不让原子弹的悲剧重演，还进行着反对砂川、冲绳等地的军事基地和争取和平的斗争。
    具体说来，我们正在修整战线，准备在明年2月至3月间展开春季斗争，用大规模罢工对抗垄断资本。
    在这种形势下，我们注视着贵国社会主义的发展，并且愿意从中吸取各种经验。
    因此，我们要继续互相来往。
    日本工人无论到哪一个国家去，回国时常常要经过中国，这已成为常识。这是由对中国各位很亲密和想学习中国的热情形成的。
    邀请中国各位到日本去，是非常困难的。但是不论怎样，日本的工人和人民斗争的结果，邀请你们到日本去的事，正在成功地进行着。现在，虽然已近年末，但是还有机械工人代表团等五个代表团在访问日本。我们也计划在明年1月邀请中国煤矿工人代表访问日本。
    这样，我们相信，日本工人和人民的斗争的巨大的力量，必将促使中、日邦交的恢复。
    亲爱的中国同志们！你们取得了革命的伟大进展，并且在着手实行第二个五年计划。
    我们相信，贵国社会主义奠定了基石，无疑是对世界和平和人类幸福的很大贡献。
    你们的进步，对日本工人阶级是多么大的鼓舞啊！
    在这种意义上，我们衷心祝贺你们第八次全国代表大会，通过自由而活泼的讨论，取得光辉的成就。
    最后，我再一次感谢你们邀请我们参加大会的友谊，并且愿意在报答各国代表的团结的意义上，高呼：
    中国工会第八次全国代表大会万岁！
    中、日两国工人和人民的友好与团结万岁！
    世界和平与团结万岁！
