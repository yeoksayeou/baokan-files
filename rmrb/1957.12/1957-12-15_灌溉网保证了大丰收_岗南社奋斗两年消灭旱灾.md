　　Irrigation Network Guarantees a Bumper Harvest
　　Gangnan Cooperative Struggles for Two Years to Eliminate Drought
　　The Gangnan Agricultural Cooperative, located in a hilly area with extremely poor water conservancy facilities, has created a miracle under the correct leadership of the Communist Party, relying on the hands of its members. In the second year after collectivization, this agricultural cooperative had already eliminated drought ahead of schedule. The total grain output has increased more than threefold compared to before liberation.
　　In the Past, Gangnan Township Suffered from Famine Year After Year
　　The Gangnan Cooperative, with 957 member households, is located at the foot of Crow Mountain in the northeast of Langxi County, Anhui Province. The cooperative has more than 14,000 mu of farmland, including more than 13,000 mu of paddy fields. In previous years, this area suffered from drought nine years out of ten. The lives of the farmers were very hard. Although the original 430-plus ponds and dams in the cooperative could irrigate 40% of the paddy fields, their ability to resist drought was very poor because the ponds and dams were small and could not store much water. This portion of paddy fields also could not be completely guaranteed a harvest. The rest of the farmland, except for a very small number that relied on drawing water from Crow Mountain, depended entirely on “heaven for harvest.” In the severe drought of 1934, 60% of the farmland in this area yielded nothing, and more than 70% of the farming households fled to other places to escape the famine.
　　After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the farmers here vigorously developed farmland water conservancy, comprehensively renovated the existing pond and dam projects, and also built a batch of new pond and dam projects, initially changing the original situation of small ponds and lack of water for irrigation in farmland. However, before the establishment of the cooperative, land was privately owned, and labor was scattered, making it impossible to carry out comprehensive planning and construction. In 1954, the year with the most rainfall, more than 2,000 mu of terraced fields and embanked fields in this cooperative still suffered from drought.
　　Cooperative Strength is Strong, Linking into an Irrigation Network
　　In the spring of 1956, the Gangnan Advanced Agricultural Cooperative was established. The newly established cooperative immediately faced a severe spring drought, the ponds and dams were dry, and there was no water for transplanting rice seedlings. At this time, the higher authorities called for "vigorous water storage and drought resistance for rice transplanting." The cadres and members of the agricultural cooperative immediately devoted themselves to the fight against drought. The drought resistance project started with the renovation of the diversion ditch of the Nanchong Pond. In less than eight days, this diversion ditch, which was thirteen li long, was widened and deepened, allowing the Nanchong Pond, which had never been fully filled before, to be filled with a pond of water. Then, the Hefei Pond production team opened a diversion ditch eight li long, bypassing four small hilltops, to divert water to the Longxu Pond. The entire cooperative quickly set off an unprecedented upsurge in opening ditches to divert water and storing water to prevent drought. From upstream to downstream, from main canals to branch canals, from branch canals to small canals, in just two months, forty-nine main canals with a total length of one hundred and eight li were opened, linking the cooperative's fifty-seven large ponds into an irrigation network. In this way, the original stagnant water ponds became flowing water ponds, and water lifting irrigation became gravity irrigation. The irrigated area increased from the original 5,000-plus mu to 12,100-plus mu, of which more than 5,500 mu became gravity irrigation, guaranteeing harvests even without rain.
　　Thanks to the construction of the irrigation network, the cooperative achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in 1956. This made the enthusiasm of the members for water conservancy construction even higher. In the winter of last year and the spring of this year, the male and female members of the cooperative, in addition to comprehensively renovating the original irrigation ditches, also built a new batch of ponds and dams and ditches, increasing the irrigated area of the irrigation network to 13,800 mu. Channels as dense as spider webs run through all the land of the Gangnan Cooperative, not only eliminating the original “relying on heaven for harvest” paddy fields, but also converting more than 260 mu of dry land into paddy fields. So far, more than 90% of the cooperative's farmland can be guaranteed not to suffer from drought even without rain for fifty days.
　　Make High Mountains Bow Their Heads, Make Rock Layers Give Way
　　The construction of the Gangnan Cooperative's irrigation network is the result of overcoming tremendous difficulties over the past two years. When the cooperative formulated its agricultural plan in 1955, the first provision stipulated "completely eliminate drought within three years." At that time, some township cadres expressed doubts about this provision. Especially in the planned project of opening a diversion ditch from Xiaobaimiao to Longxutang, it was necessary to cross four hilltops and twenty-nine valleys to divert water to irrigate the fields. Many township and cooperative cadres and members raised objections. They believed that since ancient times, they had never seen water able to cross mountains. However, due to the suffering of severe droughts and encouraged by the high tide of collectivization, under the direct leadership and support of the township party branch, the members overcame conservative ideas, worked together with one heart, and successfully completed this arduous project. Before construction started, there was neither technical guidance nor instruments, but after careful investigation and repeated research by cooperative cadres and veteran farmers, the engineering plan for opening ditches and diverting water was finally determined. In the construction, they adopted the method of opening ditches around the mountains and digging high without digging low, which not only overcame the difficulties of insufficient technical conditions in the construction, but also ensured that most of the channels were opened in accordance with the requirements. When the channel project encountered rock layers, the members exerted even more tenacious perseverance, chiseling through the hard rocks piece by piece, so that the water in the channels flowed smoothly. When encountering mountain valleys and low-lying areas, they used the method of building earth overpasses to divert the water from this mountain to another mountain. The irrigation network was built successfully under such difficult circumstances.
　　Green Mountains Reflect Green Water, Gangnan Rice is Fragrant
　　The irrigation network has enabled this cooperative, which has very poor land, to win two bumper harvests in a row. In 1956, the total grain output of the cooperative was more than 4.17 million jin. This year, the total grain output of the cooperative increased to 4.35 million jin, more than three times higher than the total output before liberation. The average yield per mu increased to 306 jin, an increase of nearly two times compared to the average yield of 107 jin per mu in 1953 before the irrigation network was built. Last year was the first year after the establishment of the cooperative, and 85% of the members had already increased their income. This year, more than 90% of the members have increased their income. Now, 78% of the poor peasant households in the cooperative have risen to the living standards of prosperous middle peasants. Except for seventeen households enjoying the "five guarantees," all the others in the cooperative have been transformed from grain-deficient households to grain-surplus households.
　　The originally bare Crow Mountain has become a new green after several years of forest protection and afforestation. Green mountains reflect green water, and Gangnan Township has become a place of beautiful scenery. In the past, whenever there was a drought, it was very difficult for residents to even get drinking water. Now, the ponds and dams are always full of water, guaranteeing the irrigation of the cooperative's farmland and the drinking water for the members. At present, the members of the Gangnan Agricultural Cooperative are actively building water conservancy projects for 1958. They plan to renovate more than 160 ponds and dams and build two new reservoirs. The members are full of confidence and are striving to achieve the target of 800 jin of grain per mu stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

　　灌溉网保证了大丰收
    岗南社奋斗两年消灭旱灾
    位于丘陵地区、水利设备极差的岗南农业社，在共产党的正确领导下，依靠社员自己的双手，创造了奇迹。在合作化后的第二年，这个农业社已提前消灭了旱灾。粮食总产量比解放前增产三倍多。
    过去岗南乡，连年遭灾荒
    拥有九百五十七户社员的岗南社在安徽省郎溪县东北乌鸦山脚下。全社有一万四千多亩田地，其中水稻田一万三千多亩。往年这个地方十年九旱，农民生活很苦，原来全社四百三十多口塘坝虽能灌溉40％的水稻田，但是由于塘坝小，蓄水量不多，抗旱能力很差，这一部分水稻田也不能完全保收。其余的农田除了极少数依靠接引乌鸦山的山水灌溉外，都是“靠天收”。1934年大旱，这个地方60％的田地颗粒无收，有70％以上的农户外出逃荒。
    解放后，这里的农民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，大力发展农田水利，全面整修了旧有塘坝工程，还兴建了一批新的塘坝工程，初步改变了原来塘坝小、农田缺水灌溉的状况。可是在办社以前，土地私有，劳力分散，无法进行全面规划、全面兴修。1954年是雨水最多的一年，这个社还有二千多亩台田、塝田受了旱灾。
    合作力量强，联成灌溉网
    1956年春，岗南高级农业社成立了。大社刚建立，就面临着严重的春旱，塘坝干涸，无水插秧。这时上级号召“大力蓄水，抗旱插秧。”农业社的干部和社员们立即投入抗旱斗争。抗旱工程首先是从整修南冲塘引水沟开始。不到八天工夫，这条全长十三里的引水沟就开宽挖深了，使从来没有蓄过满水的南冲塘蓄满了一塘水。接着，鹤飞塘生产队又开通了一条八里长、绕着四座小山头的引水沟，把水引到龙须塘。全社很快掀起了一个空前未有的开沟引水、蓄水防旱的热潮。从上游到下游，从干渠到支渠，从支渠到小渠，不过两个月的工夫，就开通了四十九条全长一百零八里的主要沟渠，把全社五十七个大塘联成一个灌溉网。这样原来的死水塘变成了活水塘，提水灌溉变成了自流灌溉。灌溉面积由原来五千多亩增加到一万二千一百多亩，其中有五千五百多亩变成了自流灌溉，不雨也能保收。
    由于建成了灌溉网，1956年全社获得空前大丰收。这样，社员们兴修水利的积极性更高。去冬今春这个社的男女社员除全面地整修了原有的灌溉沟渠外，又新建了一批塘坝和沟渠，使灌溉网的灌溉面积增加到一万三千八百亩。密如蛛网的渠道，贯穿着岗南社全部土地，不仅原来“靠天收”的水稻田消灭了，还使二百六十多亩旱地也改成了水田。至此，全社已有90％以上的田地能保证五十天不下雨也不受旱。
    要高山低头，要岩层让路
    岗南社灌溉网的建成，是两年来战胜巨大困难的结果。这个社在1955年制订农业规划时，第一条规定“三年内彻底消灭旱灾”，当时就有个别乡干部对这一条表示怀疑。特别是在计划开小白庙到龙须塘引水沟的工程，必须翻过四个山头、二十九个山凹，才能把水引过去灌田。曾有不少乡、社干部和社员提出反对。他们认为自古以来，也没有见过水能够翻山越岭的。可是社员们由于经历过严重旱灾的痛苦，在合作化高潮的鼓舞下，在乡党支部的直接领导和支持下，克服了保守思想，同心协力，胜利完成了这项艰巨的工程。在开工之前，既没有技术指导，又没有仪器，可是经过社干部和老农细致的查勘和反复研究，终于确定了开沟引水的工程计划。在施工中，他们采取环山开沟、挖高不挖低的办法，不仅克服了施工中技术条件不足的困难，而且使绝大部分的渠道都开得合乎要求。在渠道工程遇到岩层的时候，社员们更发挥了坚韧不拔的毅力，把坚硬的岩石一块一块地凿通，使渠道流水畅通无阻。遇到山谷洼地，就用筑土渡糟的方法把这座山的水引到另一座山上去。灌溉网就是在这样困难重重的情况下修建成功的。
    青山映绿水，岗南稻米香
    灌溉网使这个土地十分贫瘠的社接连赢了两个大丰收。1956年全社粮食总产量四百一十七万多斤，今年全社粮食总产量提高到四百三十五万斤，超过解放前总产量三倍以上，平均每亩产量增长到三百零六斤，比兴修灌溉网以前的1953年平均每亩产一百零七斤增产近二倍。去年是办社后的第一年，全社已有85％的社员增加了收入，今年增加收入的社员有90％以上。现在全社已有78％的贫农户，上升到富裕中农的生活水平，全社除十七户五保户外，其余已全部由缺粮户变成了余粮户。
    原来光秃秃的乌鸦山经过几年来的护林造林，已是一片新绿。青山映绿水，岗南乡已变成一个风景美丽的地方。过去，每逢天旱，居民连吃水都十分困难，现在，塘坝总是蓄满着水，保证着全社农田灌溉和社员的吃水。目前，岗南农业社的社员们，正积极兴修1958年度的水利工程，他们计划整修一百六十多处塘坝，新建两个水库。社员们满怀信心，为提前实现全国农业发展纲要规定每亩产粮八百斤的指标而努力。
