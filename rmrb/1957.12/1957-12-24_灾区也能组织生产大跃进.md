(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Henan Province's farmers in disaster areas, after several months of arduous struggle, have quickly recovered their vitality. Currently, just like non-disaster areas, they have launched a production and construction upsurge centered on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation.

Many agricultural cooperatives in the disaster areas of Shangqiu, Kaifeng, Xuchang, and Xinxiang organized mass debates on issues such as "Can disaster areas organize a Great Leap Forward in production?" and "Can agricultural production construction and disaster relief both be done well?" This ignited the production enthusiasm of the peasant masses, leading to the formulation of comprehensive plans for long-term farmland water conservancy construction and winter agricultural and sideline production, adapting to local conditions, in order to fundamentally eliminate disasters. Farmers in the disaster area of Fengqiu County put forward the battle slogan: "Grit our teeth and fight hard for three to five years, transform saline-alkali depressions into fertile land, and transform annual disasters into seasonal harvests!" Daqiao Agricultural Cooperative in Weishi County, a cooperative that suffered heavy disasters year after year, formulated a five-year farmland water conservancy construction plan based on the principle of water storage as the main focus. The plan aims to achieve an average yield of 1,000 catties per mu by 1962, based on this year's grain yield of 357 catties per mu. In the recent short period of just over a month, the three disaster-stricken counties of Yanjin, Yuanyang, and Fengqiu have already transformed more than 83,700 mu of depressions.

Sideline production in the disaster areas has also been launched. Currently, about 1.45 million people are participating in sideline production, accounting for 20% of the labor force in the disaster areas. According to statistics from August to the end of November, more than 20 million yuan has been earned from sideline production.

At present, the winter housing for disaster victims has been basically resolved, and the difficulties in clothing, food, and other aspects have also been properly addressed.

    灾区也能组织生产大跃进
    据新华社讯　河南省灾区农民经过几个月的艰苦奋斗，迅速恢复了元气，目前和非灾区一样，掀起了以兴修水利和积肥为中心的生产建设热潮。
    商丘、开封、许昌和新乡等灾区许多农业社曾就“灾区能否组织生产大跃进”、“农业生产建设、生产救灾能不能都搞好”等问题，组织群众展开大鸣、大放、大辩论，激发了农民群众的生产热情，从而因地制宜地制订出长远的农田水利建设和冬季农副业生产的全面规划，以便从根本上消除灾害。封丘县灾区农民提出了“咬紧牙关苦战三、五年，变盐碱洼地为良田，变年年受灾为季季丰收”的战斗口号。尉氏县大桥农业社是个连年重灾社，根据以蓄为主的治水方针，制订出了五年的农田水利建设规划，计划在今年亩产三百五十七斤粮食的基础上，到1962年达到平均亩产一千斤。延津、原阳、封丘等三个受灾县，在最近短短的一个多月内已经改造洼地八万三千七百多亩。
    灾区的副业生产也开展起来了。目前各地参加副业生产的约有一百四十五万人，占灾区劳力的20％。据8月到11月底的统计，已从副业生产中收入二千多万元。
    现在，灾民过冬的住所已经基本解决，衣、食等方面的困难也都得到妥善解决。
