Xinhua News Agency Report: The United States' plan to establish missile bases in its European member states through the upcoming North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit has aroused strong opposition from people in Western and Northern European countries.

    Paris News: A group of French Communist parliamentarians submitted a proposal to the Secretariat of the National Assembly on December 7, demanding that the National Assembly determine its position on the issue of "peace or war" on the eve of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting.
    On the same day, Parisian newspapers published an appeal to people from all walks of life by a group of well-known French political activists, opposing the storage of nuclear weapons on French territory. Radical Socialist Party member of parliament, Ernu, also wrote to the French Minister of Defense to question him about the American plan to establish atomic bases in France, asking him to explain when and in what manner the French government granted this right to the United States.
    Professor Lavarenne of the Faculty of Law of the University of Paris recently wrote an article in the "International Forum" weekly, criticizing the American plan to establish missile bases in France as a criminal act against the French people. The author said, "If we agree to set up American rockets in France, this will be a shameful trampling on our national sovereignty. France, Britain, and Germany will be reduced to the ranks of the undisputed vassal states of the United States, such as Puerto Rico and the Philippines."
    Düsseldorf News: The West German Peace Committee published a blue book on December 7 regarding the West German people's struggle against atomic armament. The blue book recorded various statements, resolutions, and appeals made by people in West German scientific, political, trade union, and religious circles between April 1 and November 25 this year regarding opposition to the storage of nuclear weapons in West Germany and opposition to equipping the West German army with atomic weapons. On the eve of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Paris meeting, the West German Peace Committee used these documents to prove that the overwhelming majority of the West German people oppose any kind of atomic armament.
    Rome News: The Secretariat of the Italian National Peace Council issued a statement opposing the plan to establish missile bases in Italy. The statement emphasized that this practice of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is incompatible with the interests of world peace and the interests of Europe and Italy. Italy must reject this "dangerous policy."
    The Italian National Peace Council issued this statement because of news that Italian Foreign Minister Bella had recently assured Dulles during negotiations in Washington that Italy "does not particularly oppose" the establishment of North Atlantic Treaty Organization missile bases on its territory.
    Oslo News: The Norwegian Communist Party published a statement in "Freedom News" on December 7, calling on the people to unite and put forward the following demands: "No foreign bases are allowed on Norwegian soil! No rockets, atomic weapons, or hydrogen weapons are allowed to be transported to Norway! Ban all kinds of nuclear weapons! Strive to ease international tensions! Strive for peace and peaceful coexistence between all peoples!"

    西欧和北欧各国公众
　　不许美国在欧洲建立导弹基地
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国准备通过即将举行的北大西洋集团首脑会议在欧洲成员国设置导弹基地的计划，引起了西欧和北欧各国人士的强烈反对。
    巴黎消息：法国一批共产党议员7日向国民议会秘书处提出一项议案，要求国民议会在北大西洋集团会议开会前夕确定自己在“和平还是战争”问题上的立场。
    同一天，巴黎各报发表了法国一批著名政治活动家致各界人士的呼吁书，反对在法国领土上储存核武器。激进社会党议员艾尔努也就美国计划在法国建立原子基地的事写信质问法国国防部长，要他说明法国政府是在什么时候以什么方式给予美国这种权利的。
    巴黎大学法学院教授拉维尔涅最近在“国际论坛”周刊上著文抨击美国在法国设立导弹基地的计划是对法国人的犯罪行为。作者说，“假如我们同意在法国设置美国火箭，这就是可耻地践踏我们的国家主权。法国、英国和德国将降低到美国的不折不扣的附庸国波多黎各和菲律宾之列。”
    杜塞尔多夫消息：西德和平委员会7日发表了关于西德人民反对原子军备斗争的蓝皮书。蓝皮书中记载了西德科学界、政界、工会和宗教界人士在今年4月1日到11月25日之间所发表的关于反对在西德存放核武器以及反对用原子武器装备西德军队的各项声明、决议和呼吁书。在北大西洋集团巴黎会议开会的前夕，西德和平委员会用这些文件证明：压倒多数的西德人民是反对任何种类的原子军备的。
    罗马消息：意大利全国和平理事会秘书处发表声明，反对在意大利境内建立导弹基地的计划。声明强调说，北大西洋集团的这种做法是同全世界和平的利益以及欧洲和意大利的利益不相容的。意大利必须拒绝这种“危险政策”。
    意大利全国和平理事会发表这个声明，是因为有消息说，意大利外交部长贝拉最近在华盛顿同杜勒斯举行谈判时曾经向对方保证，意大利“并不特别反对”在它的境内建立北大西洋集团的导弹基地。
    奥斯陆消息：挪威共产党7日在“自由报”上发表声明，号召人民团结起来提出下列要求：“在挪威土地上不许建立任何外国基地！不许运火箭、原子武器和氢武器到挪威来！禁止各种核武器！争取缓和国际紧张局势！争取和平和各国人民之间的和平共处！”
