　　The five bureaus and departments of agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy in Jiangxi Province, along with most of the directly affiliated institutions and enterprises of these bureaus and departments, have entered a high tide of comprehensive rectification and airing of views since December 16th. Cadres of the Department of Agriculture continued airing their views on Sunday without taking a break, while employees of the Department of Water Conservancy worked overnight to write big-character posters. According to statistics from December 17th to 23rd, the departments and bureaus have already posted 539 big-character posters.

　　The characteristics of this airing of views are: the scope and nature of the opinions are relatively broad and profound; more significant problems in areas such as leadership style, professional work, and guiding principles and policies are being exposed compared to before; and more criticisms that specifically name names and suggest research are being made. According to incomplete statistics from the five departments and bureaus, including the Department of Agriculture, a total of 2,597 opinions of various types were put forward by the 740 people who participated in the airing of views from December 17th to 23rd, of which criticisms and opinions on leadership style and work accounted for more than 50% of the total number of opinions. All but two of the cadres above the level of section chief in the Department of Water Conservancy have been named in criticisms.

　　While the high tide of airing of views arrived rapidly, the rectification work of the departments and bureaus has also made rapid progress. All units can promptly classify and sort out the opinions put forward by the masses and carry out rectification according to the principle of "pick up the sesame seeds first, then hug the watermelon," so the progress is relatively fast. The processing of opinions on the 20th alone accounted for 56.5% of the total number of opinions from the masses. Due to the leading role of the leadership and the implementation of the mass line method, the quality of rectification is generally guaranteed. When the masses of the Meteorological Bureau raised concerns about poor environmental sanitation, Deputy Director Yang personally joined the masses in cleaning the toilets the next morning. When cadres of the Department of Water Conservancy pointed out the urgent need to strengthen technical guidance work during the current high tide of farmland water conservancy construction, the leadership immediately began to organize personnel to conduct research and find solutions. The departments and bureaus not only promptly processed and responded to the opinions raised during this airing of views, but also seriously addressed the issues that remained to be resolved from the previous airing of views and some opinions transferred from other departments. The masses are generally satisfied with the handling of these issues.

　　The leaders of the departments and bureaus have also paid special attention to the major issues raised by the masses regarding professional work and guiding principles and policies, and the relevant departments have been tasked with studying and proposing solutions, which will be addressed and improved through more airing of views and debates among the masses.

    江西省农业林业水利各单位
    鸣放热烈　整改迅速
    本报讯　江西省农业林业水利等五个厅、局和大部分厅、局的直属事业、企业单位，自12月16日起，转入了全面整改鸣放的高潮。农业厅干部星期日不休假继续鸣放，水利厅职工连夜赶写大字报，根据本月17日至23日的统计，各厅局已贴出大字报五百三十九张。
    这次鸣放的特点是：意见的范围和性质比较广泛和深刻，对领导作风、业务工作、方针政策等方面的重大问题揭露比以前较多，指名指事的批评和研究建议性的意见较多。据农业厅等五个厅局不完全统计，自17日至23日参加鸣放的七百四十人共提出各类意见二千五百九十七条，其中对领导作风和工作方面的批评意见占意见总数50％以上。水利厅科处长以上的干部除了两人外，都已被指名批评。
    鸣放高潮迅速到来的同时，各厅局的整改工作也有迅速的进展。各单位对群众所提的意见都能及时分类排队，按照“先拣芝麻，后抱西瓜”的原则进行整改，因此进度较快。20日一天所处理的就占群众意见总数的56.5％。由于领导带头和贯彻群众路线方法，一般都保证了整改的质量。气象局群众提出环境卫生不好，杨副局长在第二天清晨就亲自和群众一起打扫厕所。水利厅干部提出当前兴修农田水利高潮，迫切需要加强技术指导工作，领导上立即着手组织人员进行研究解决。各厅局不仅对这次鸣放的意见及时进行了处理答复，而且认真处理前次鸣放时尚待处理解决的问题和其他部门转来的一些意见。群众对这些问题的处理普遍感到满意。
    对群众提出的业务工作、方针政策方面的重大问题，各厅局领导也都特别加以重视，并由有关部门研究提出处理方案，将通过群众更多的鸣放辩论，加以处理改进。
