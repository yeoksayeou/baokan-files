　　Laibin County Launches Large-Scale Water Conservancy Project; Thousand-Year-Old Drought to Be Conquered
    Guangxi Daily Editorial Calls for Learning from Laibin Experience and Striving to Eliminate Drought in the Province Within Three Years
    This newspaper reports that Laibin County, a famous drought-stricken area in Guangxi Province, will basically eliminate drought by next year. This is the goal set by the county for this winter and next spring's water conservancy work. A magnificent farmland water conservancy construction movement is now underway.
    Laibin County plans to expand the irrigated area by 530,000 mu through water conservancy construction this winter and next spring, of which 300,000 to 350,000 mu will have drought resistance capabilities of more than 50 days. After the completion of this plan, the area of ​​water-retaining paddy fields with drought resistance of more than 50 days in the county will increase to about 90% of the total area of ​​paddy fields in the county. In order to complete this plan, the entire county, united as one, contributes strength, money, and materials, and generally starts work ahead of schedule, with a momentum far exceeding that of the spring of 1956. According to statistics, as of November 22, the county has already started construction on 81 water conservancy projects. The irrigation area of ​​these projects is more than 414,000 mu, accounting for more than 77% of the planned area. More than 30,000 farmers in the county have been working on water conservancy projects.
    Laibin is a famous drought-stricken area in Guangxi Province with extremely poor water conservancy infrastructure, vast dry land, sparse forests, and irregular rainfall. Historically, every autumn and winter, when there is a shortage of water, about half of the 1,524 villages in the county do not even have enough drinking water for people and livestock. Water is often used three times: first for washing faces, then for washing clothes, and then for feeding livestock. Of the 770,000 mu of paddy fields in the county, only more than 50,000 mu are water-retaining fields with drought resistance of more than 50 days. "Fields that depend on the sky" account for 640,000 mu and often experience reduced yields due to drought. By the winter of 1955, the county had only about 90,000 mu of water-retaining fields. After cooperativization, water conservancy construction has achieved great development. In the past two years, water conservancy projects have been built to expand the irrigated area by more than 400,000 mu of land (a small part of which has been renovated), of which 210,000 mu have drought resistance of more than 50 days, increasing the county's water-retaining fields from 50,000 mu in the past to 300,000 mu. As a result of large-scale water conservancy, the county suffered an unprecedented drought in 1956, but grain production increased by more than 20% compared to 1955.
    As early as 1955, when cooperativization was just realized, the county party committee proposed that water conservancy should be regarded as the fundamental key to developing agricultural production. The secretary took action, the entire party was mobilized, and the masses were vigorously led to build water conservancy projects. Aiming at the thinking of some cadres and the masses who believed that "the mountains are poor and the water is exhausted, there is no water source; the people's lives are hard, and there is no strength to build water conservancy," the leaders put forward slogans such as "There is water in the mountains, water in the rivers, and water in the springs" and "Mobilize all manpower, exert all material resources, utilize all financial resources, and tap all potential" to mobilize the broad masses. In the winter of 1956, many areas were at a low ebb in water conservancy construction, but Laibin still maintained the greatest momentum and set off a high tide of the water conservancy movement. In the past two years, 40% to 50% of the labor force in the county has participated in water conservancy construction every winter and spring, and because of relying on the masses, it has truly achieved spending less money, doing more things, and ensuring good quality. Last winter and this spring, the county only spent more than 400,000 yuan of state funds to build water conservancy projects that originally required more than 3 million yuan to build.
    At present, according to incomplete statistics, the county's agricultural cooperatives have raised more than 210,000 yuan in water conservancy funds. More than 5,000 farmers in Qianjiang, Fenghuang, and Guxi districts also brought their own food, oil, and salt to build water conservancy projects. The Niujiaotang farmers in Qingling District also proposed: Rely on the mountains near the mountains, rely on the water near the water, rely on their own efforts, raise funds themselves if the funds are insufficient, burn lime themselves, take sand from the river, cut stone slabs themselves, and weave mud baskets themselves, and save as much as possible. The Chenxiang District originally required more than 100,000 yuan to complete the water conservancy task of building and irrigating 15,000 mu of land. Now, the farmers are willing to use labor to top up the investment, and it only takes an investment of 8,000 yuan to complete the construction. Dabaoxiang in Nansi District used to rely on others' support to build canals, divert river water, and achieve a bumper harvest. Now, the farmers in this township say: "We will support others for twelve years." The entire township has transferred many people to help build the Zhangcun Reservoir in Gao'an and Aotang townships, more than 20 li away, with their own food.
    This newspaper reports that on the 25th of last month, Guangxi Daily published an editorial on the great achievements and experience of Laibin County in building farmland water conservancy, calling on the entire province to learn from the example of Laibin County, with the greatest determination, rely on the masses, and basically eliminate drought within three years.
    The editorial said that under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of Laibin County, with a vigorous revolutionary spirit and an indomitable and strong will, have been building water conservancy projects on a large scale since the winter of 1955. After another winter this year, the thousand-year-old drought will be basically conquered, agricultural production will have a greater leap forward, and the lives of farmers will also have a greater improvement. This fact has given the people of the whole province infinite confidence and strength.
    In the two years after cooperativization, the farmers of Laibin County broke through all kinds of difficulties and built more than 1,000 water conservancy projects, achieving reservoirs in every district and ponds and dams in every township. Due to the rapid development of water conservancy construction, the total grain output of the county in 1956 increased by 63% compared with 1952. In 1957, the county changed from a grain-deficient area to a grain self-sufficient area for the first time. This summer, the county comprehensively planned the water conservancy construction of 180 townships and proposed the combat program of "attacking this year, finishing next year, and eliminating ordinary drought in paddy fields in two years." The county originally planned to build 350,000 mu of water conservancy projects this winter and next spring, but the agricultural cooperatives reported that it would be expanded to more than 500,000 mu.
    The editorial said that if every county in the province can eliminate drought in the shortest possible time like Laibin, and ensure that all 24 million mu of paddy fields in the province have water for irrigation, this condition alone can increase the average yield per mu by about 150 jin, and more than 2 billion jin of grain will be produced every year.
    The editorial believes that in Guangxi, no matter which region, as long as there is determination, drought can be basically eliminated within three years. With the addition of one or two years of finishing work, water conservancy irrigation on existing cultivated land can be close to completion. Some comrades regard the elimination of drought as a matter of a fairly distant future. But with examples like Laibin, we have confidence. Laibin was able to basically eliminate drought in three years even with a very weak water conservancy foundation and very harsh natural conditions. Most areas in the province originally had better natural conditions and better water conservancy foundations than Laibin. Can't we basically eliminate drought in three years? Xincheng, Liujiang, Luocheng, Huanjiang and other counties originally planned to eliminate drought in three to five years, but after the leading cadres of these counties visited Laibin, their thinking was immediately liberated, and they were all confident in eliminating drought in one year.
    In the water conservancy construction movement, to keep the masses' enthusiasm high for a long time and persist until victory, the key lies in the leadership's firm determination.
    Laibin's experience also shows that only by closely relying on the strength of the masses, using the methods of the mass line, and implementing the policy of "collectives running and public assistance" with a focus on building small and medium-sized water conservancy projects, can we set off one high tide after another in water conservancy construction, and can we complete water conservancy construction plans in a more numerous, faster, better, and more economical way. Laibin's experience proves that there is an inexhaustible wisdom and inexhaustible strength in the masses. As long as the masses are liberated from the shackles of conservative thinking, and the masses realize that nature can be understood and transformed, and realize the direct connection between water conservancy construction and improving their own lives, then anything can be done and any difficulties can be overcome. What if there is no money? The masses will save money and raise funds themselves. What if there is no material data? The masses said: "There is labor, there is everything." "Poor people are not poor in ambition," "We must rely on our own hands to compete with God." What if there are no technicians? "The construction site is a school, and the project is a textbook."
    Those comrades who cannot see the wisdom of the masses, cannot see the strength of the masses, and only stretch their hands to the state, should take a good lesson in the mass line from Laibin's experience. (Attached picture)

　　来宾全县大兴水利　千年苦旱将被征服
    广西日报社论号召学习来宾经验，争取全省三年内基本上消灭旱灾
    本报讯　广西省著名的苦旱地区来宾县，将在明年内基本上消灭旱灾，这是这个县规定的今冬明春水利工作的目标，现在一个规模壮阔的农田水利建设运动，正在展开。
    来宾县计划今冬明春兴修水利扩大灌溉面积五十三万亩，其中抗旱能力在五十天以上的占三十万亩到三十五万亩。完成这一计划以后，全县抗旱五十天以上的保水田将增加到占全县稻田总面积的90％左右。为了完成这一计划，全县上下，万众一心，有力出力，有钱出钱，有物出物，普遍提前动工，劲头之大远远超过1956年春天。据统计，到11月22日止，全县已经动工的水利工程达八十一处，这些工程的灌溉面积是四十一万四千多亩，占计划数的77％以上。全县出工修水利的农民已达三万多人。
    来宾是广西省著名的苦旱地区，水利基础极差，旱地辽阔，加上境内山光岭秃，林木稀少，雨水不调，历史上每到秋冬缺水季节，全县一千五百二十四个村庄中就有一半左右连人畜饮水都不够，往往一水三用：先洗脸，再洗衣，再喂牲畜。全县七十七万亩稻田中，抗旱五十天以上的保水田只五万多亩，“望天田”占六十四万亩，经常因为干旱减产。到1955年冬天，全县保水田不过九万亩左右。合作化后，水利建设获得了巨大的发展。两年来兴修的水利扩大灌溉面积四十多万亩田（有一小部分是修缮的），其中抗旱五十天以上的达二十一万亩，使全县保水田从过去的五万亩增至三十万亩。大兴水利的结果，全县在1956年虽然遭到空前大旱，粮食却比1955年增产20％以上。
    还在1955年刚刚实现合作化的时候，县委就提出应该把修水利当作发展农业生产的根本关键，书记动手，全党动员，大力领导群众兴修水利。针对部分干部和群众认为“山穷水尽，没有水源；群众生活苦，没有力量修水利”的思想，领导上提出“有山就有水，有河就有水，有泉就有水”和“动员一切人力，发挥一切物力，利用一切财力，挖掘一切潜力”等口号，发动了广大群众。1956年冬天，许多地区兴修水利处于低潮，但在来宾仍然保持了最大的劲头，掀起了水利运动高潮。两年来，每年冬春全县参加修水利的劳动力都达40％—50％，而且由于依靠群众，真正做到了花钱少，办事多，质量好。去冬今春，全县只花国家的四十多万元，就修成了原来需要三百多万元才能修成的水利。
    目前，据不完全统计，全县农业社已自筹水利经费二十一万多元。迁江、凤凰、古昔等区五千多农民还自带粮食、油盐去修水利。青岭区牛角塘农民还提出：近山靠山、近水靠水，自力更生，资金不足自己筹，石灰自己烧，沙子河里要，石片自己打，泥箕自己编，尽量节约。城厢区原来要十多万元才能完成兴修灌溉一万五千亩的水利任务，现在，农民愿意用劳动力顶投资，只要投资八千元就可修成。南泗区大宝乡，过去靠别人支援，修了水渠，引来河水，获得丰收。现在这个乡农民说：“要我们支援别人十二年，我们也干。”全乡已抽调许多人自带伙食到二十多里外的高安、鳌塘乡去帮修樟村水库。
    本报讯　上月25日广西日报就来宾县在兴修农田水利上的巨大成就和经验发表社论，号召全省学习来宾县的榜样，以最大的决心，依靠群众，在三年内基本上消灭旱灾。
    社论说，来宾县人民在党和政府的领导下，以朝气蓬勃的革命精神，百折不回的坚强意志，从1955年冬起，大兴水利，再经过今年一个冬天之后，千年干旱将要被基本上征服，农业生产将要有更大的跃进，农民生活也将有更大的改善，这个事实给了全省人民以无限的信心和力量。
    合作化后的两年里，来宾县农民冲破万重困难，兴修水利工程一千多处，做到区区有水库，乡乡有塘坝。由于水利建设的突飞猛进，1956年全县粮食总产量比1952年增加63％。1957年这个县第一次由缺粮变为粮食自给。今年夏季这个县全面规划了一百八十个乡的水利建设，提出“今年突击，明年扫尾，两年消灭稻田普通旱灾”的战斗纲领，县里原计划今冬明春兴修水利三十五万亩，农业社自报扩大到五十多万亩。
    社论说，如果全省每一个县都能像来宾一样，在最短时间内消灭旱灾，保证全省两千四百万亩水田有水灌溉，单只这一个条件，平均每亩一般就可增产一百五十斤左右，每年就要多打粮食二十多亿斤。
    社论认为，在广西来说，无论那一个地区，只要有决心，大体上都可以在三年内基本上消灭旱灾，再加上一年或二年的扫尾工作，现有耕地上水利灌溉，就可以接近全部完成。有的同志把消灭旱灾看成是相当遥远的将来的事情。但是有了来宾这样的事例，我们就有了底了。来宾在水利基础十分薄弱和自然条件十分恶劣的情况下，尚且能够在三年时间内基本消灭旱灾，全省大部分地区原来自然条件比来宾强，水利基础比来宾好，难道还不能够在三年内基本消灭旱灾吗？忻城、柳江、罗城、环江等县，原来计划要三年至五年才能消灭旱灾，但这些县的领导干部到来宾参观以后，他们的思想立即解放了，他们都有把握一年消灭旱灾。
    在兴修水利运动中，要使群众长期保持着高涨热情，一直坚持到胜利，关键在于领导上有坚定不移的决心。
    来宾的经验还说明了：只有紧紧依靠群众的力量，运用群众路线的方法，执行“社办公助”以兴修中小型水利为主的方针，才可能掀起一个又一个的水利建设高潮，才可能又多、又快、又好、又省地完成水利兴修计划。来宾的经验证明，群众中才有取之不竭的智慧，用之不尽的力量，只要把群众从保守思想的束缚中解放出来，使群众认识到大自然可以理解、可以改造，认识到兴修水利和自己改善生活的直接联系，就什么事情都办得到，什么困难都能克服。没有钱怎么办？群众就自己省吃俭用筹措资金。没有物质资料怎么办？群众说：“有劳力就有一切。”“人穷志不穷”，“要靠自己的双手和天老爷比高低”，没有技术人员怎么办？“工地就是学校，工程就是教材”。
    那些看不见群众智慧，看不见群众力量，只把双手伸向国家的同志，应该从来宾的经验中好好地补习群众路线的一课。（附图片）
