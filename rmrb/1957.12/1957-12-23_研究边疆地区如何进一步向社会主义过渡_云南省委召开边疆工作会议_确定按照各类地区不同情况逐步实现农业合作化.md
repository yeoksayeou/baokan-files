Studying How to Further Transition to Socialism in Border Areas
Yunnan Provincial Party Committee Convenes Border Work Conference
Determining to Gradually Realize Agricultural Cooperativization According to Different Situations in Various Regions

(Our report) The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee convened a border work conference from December 12th to 20th. Attending the meeting were 146 cadres at the prefectural, county, and district levels from the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, and remote areas such as Simao, Lijiang, and Lincang. The meeting summarized the achievements made in production cooperation and mutual assistance in border areas over the past year and focused on discussing how to further transition to socialism in border areas.

In the border ethnic minority areas of Yunnan, with a population of two million, the enthusiasm of the masses for production has soared to unprecedented heights in the past year or so, and agricultural production has greatly developed. While vigorously developing production, the mutual aid and cooperation movement has been steadily carried out, and 2,077 elementary agricultural cooperatives have been established, with 62,404 peasant households joining the cooperatives, accounting for 21.9% of the total number of households in areas where land reform has been completed. This year, more than 90% of the cooperatives increased production, with some increasing production by 50% to 100%. As a result, the socialist consciousness of the peasants has been further enhanced, and the unity among ethnic groups has been strengthened.

Border areas are different from general inland areas. Although land reform has been carried out, it is not thorough. Moreover, since the border areas are ethnic minority areas, agricultural cooperativization in border areas must fully consider the special circumstances of these areas. The Provincial Party Committee believes that in areas where semi-socialist cooperativization has been basically realized and where cooperativization has developed to account for more than 50% of peasant households, the current main task is to concentrate efforts on running the existing agricultural cooperatives well, earnestly improving the management of agricultural cooperatives, vigorously developing production, and striving to surpass the production level of local wealthy middle peasants within three to five years. While running the existing cooperatives well, actively carry out the work of establishing cooperatives in empty villages and gradually transfer cooperatives on the basis of continuously increasing production, striving to realize agricultural socialist cooperativization in about two years. In Dehong, Shuangjiang, Honghe, Xishuangbanna, Lancang and other places where the proportion of cooperativization is not large and have gone through the pilot stage of establishing cooperatives, they should be developed in stages and batches according to conditions while running existing cooperatives well; when the conditions are ripe, they should organize a leap forward, striving to fully realize agricultural socialist cooperativization in four to five years.

In order to further consolidate and expand the position of existing agricultural cooperatives, the Provincial Party Committee believes that cooperatives must be established on a reliable class basis, that is, to truly rely on poor and lower-middle peasants to unite middle peasants, establish the superiority of poor and hired peasants, and at the same time, continuously demonstrate superiority in production. In order to help agricultural cooperatives expand their production capacity, in the future, special subsidies for border areas will be mainly used to support agricultural cooperatives in carrying out agricultural capital construction and gradually promote technological reform, thereby helping agricultural cooperatives lay a solid foundation in production. In terms of agricultural production, the Provincial Party Committee believes that all localities should resolutely develop grain crops as the foundation, develop diversified operations in accordance with local conditions, and comprehensively develop production. Border areas are no exception to paying attention to water conservancy construction, increasing fertilizer application, and other measures, and gradually realizing the reform of the cultivation system, changing dry land to paddy fields, changing single-cropping to double-cropping, and changing sloping land to terraces, according to the characteristics of different regions.

In order to ensure a smooth transition to socialism in ethnic minority areas, socialist education should also be carried out in different ways among Party and state cadres and the entire people, and emphasis should be placed on opposing bourgeois nationalism, that is, opposing Han chauvinism and local nationalism, and cultivating communist cadres of all ethnic groups.

    研究边疆地区如何进一步向社会主义过渡
    云南省委召开边疆工作会议
    确定按照各类地区不同情况逐步实现农业合作化
    本报讯  中共云南省委于12月12日至20日召开了边疆工作会议。参加这次会议的有德宏傣族景颇族自治州、红河哈尼族彝族自治州、迪庆藏族自治州、西双版纳傣族自治州、怒江傈僳族自治州及思茅、丽江、临沧等边远地区的地、县、区三级干部共一百四十六人。会议总结了一年来边疆地区在生产合作互助方面所取得的成绩，并着重地讨论了在边疆地区如何进一步向社会主义过渡的问题。
    云南二百万人口的边疆民族地区，一年多来，广大群众的生产积极性空前高涨，农业生产有了很大发展，在大力发展生产的同时，稳步地开展了互助合作运动，先后建立了二千零七十七个初级农业合作社，入社农户六万二千四百零四户，占已完成土地改革区总户数的21.9％。今年90％以上的社增加了生产，其中部分社增产50％至100％。因而也进一步地提高了农民的社会主义觉悟和增强了民族之间的团结。
    边疆地区不同于一般内地，虽然经过了土地改革，但不彻底，又由于边疆是少数民族地区，因此，边疆地区农业合作化就要充分考虑到这类地区的特殊情况。省委认为，在已经基本实现半社会主义合作化和合作化已发展到占农户50％以上的地区，当前的主要任务是集中力量办好现有的农业社，认真改善农业社的经营管理，大力发展生产，争取在三、五年内超过当地富裕中农的生产水平。在办好现有社的情况下，积极开展空白村寨的建社工作，并在不断增加生产的基础上逐步转社，争取在两年左右实现农业社会主义合作化。在合作化所占比重还不大和经过试点办社阶段的德宏、双江、红河、西双版纳、澜沧等地，应在办好现有社的同时，根据条件分期分批地发展；到条件已经成熟时，就组织跃进，争取在四、五年内全面实现农业社会主义合作化。
    要使现有农业社进一步巩固和扩大自己的阵地，省委认为必须把合作社建立在可靠的阶级基础上，即切实依靠贫雇农和下中农团结中农，树立起贫雇农优势，同时还要从生产上不断地显示优越性。为了帮助农业社扩大生产能力，今后边疆特殊补助款将重点用于扶持农业社进行农业基本建设，逐步推进技术改革，从而帮助农业社在生产上奠定可靠的基础。在农业生产方面，省委认为各地应坚决以发展粮食作物为基础，因地制宜地开展多种经营，全面地发展生产。边疆也毫不例外地要注重兴修水利、增施肥料等措施，并逐步实现耕作制度的改革，根据不同地区的特点，分别改旱地为水田，改单季为复种，改坡地为梯田等。
    为了保证边疆民族地区顺利地过渡到社会主义，还要在党和国家机关干部和全体人民群众中采用不同的方式分别进行社会主义教育，并应着重反对资产阶级民族主义，即反对大汉族主义和地方民族主义，培养各民族的共产主义干部。
