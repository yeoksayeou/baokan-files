Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: The Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions continued on December 5th. Ten delegates and thirteen foreign guests invited to attend the congress spoke and delivered addresses at the meeting.

    Qi Tinghan (Chairman of the Trade Union of Factory 53) introduced in detail the experience of the trade union organization of Factory 53 in promoting and leading a new production upsurge based on the principles of extensive airing of views, full-scale debate, and thorough reform. Their initial approach to leading this production upsurge was: (1) Overcoming the passive sentiment of some cadres who were waiting for the upsurge to appear; (2) Fully utilizing the forms of workers' representative assemblies and production meetings to absorb the broad masses in enterprise management and establish a new atmosphere of solving problems independently; (3) Carrying out diverse small-scale competitions based on production characteristics; (4) Relying on and leveraging the role of veteran workers, advanced producers, and activists; (5) Continuing to carry out mass-based comprehensive debates, relying on the masses to overcome conservative thinking in leadership, implementing the spirit of rectification alongside reform, and further promoting the arrival of a new upsurge.

    Five representatives from five trade union organizations in Ceylon delivered congratulatory messages to the congress, conveying the friendship of the Ceylonese workers to the Chinese workers.

    A. Aziz, Chairman of the Ceylon Democratic Workers' Congress, said that your achievements have won the admiration of all who care about human happiness. We hope that you will be able to accomplish your great tasks well. Your victory will strengthen the confidence of the people of Asia and Africa, making them believe that only the socialist system can save them.

    K.M.P. Mendis, Chairman of the Ceylon Federation of Trade Unions, said that he had attended the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions held in 1953, where the representatives of the Chinese workers discussed the First Five-Year Plan. After listening to the report of this congress, he knew that the First Five-Year Plan had been overfulfilled. Mendis said that the various Ceylonese delegations that had visited China at various times were deeply impressed by the tremendous progress that China had made in a short period.

    Vidyasagara, representative of the Ceylon Labor Union, said that Chinese workers have taken this great country into their own hands and are working hard to build a new society on the ruins of the old. In our hearts, you occupy a special place of affection, because your victory and your achievements are a source of inspiration for all of us Asians.

    J. Jayawardana, representative of the Ceylon Independent Industrial and General Workers Union, said that the victory of the Chinese working people has always been a source of great strength to inspire us. The brotherly invitation to the various trade unions in Ceylon has facilitated representatives of the Ceylonese working class to come to China and learn many valuable experiences in the trade union movement. After his address, Jayawardana presented gifts to the congress. All the delegates applauded warmly to express their gratitude.

    Perera, representative of the Ceylon Port Workers Union, in his congratulatory message, recounted in detail the long-standing friendly relations between Ceylon and China, and the history of the Ceylonese people's struggle for independence. He also expressed his hope to receive help in their progress.

    Zhang Sixiao (coal miner and national advanced producer from Fengfeng Coal Mine, Hebei Province) said in his speech that in the Second Five-Year Plan, we must produce more coal to develop industry and support our farmer brothers to produce more grain.

    Wang Xiuying (worker of the Hao Jianxiu team of Qingdao State No. 6 Cotton Mill) reported to the congress on the production achievements of the Hao Jianxiu team over the past few years. He said that the team had comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan every year for the past five years.

    Zheng Ren (Deputy Director of the National Salt Industry Trade Union Work Committee) said in his speech that during the Second Five-Year Plan, the state has put forward higher requirements for salt production, and we must work hard to complete this arduous task.

    Fr. Kacha, Secretary of the Central Council of Czechoslovak Trade Unions, said in his address, and when he said "No force can destroy the sincere friendship between us, and no force can destroy the cooperation and friendship between our people and the Soviet people," the audience responded with warm applause.

    Vehri Rantanen, Second Chairman of the Central Federation of Finnish Trade Unions, paid tribute to the congress on behalf of the Executive Committee of the Central Federation of Finnish Trade Unions.

    Benoît Frachon, General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labour of France, delivered a speech expressing his tribute to the Chinese working class. He said that in France, we have a common goal with the proletariat all over the world, but the tasks of the trade union are different from yours. We must fight against the ruling class who hate peace and hate socialism. The General Confederation of Labour of France believes that fighting against all obstacles to unified action is our main task. After his address, Frachon presented the congress with a banner and a precious gift: the "National Salvation Times," published in Paris by some members of the Chinese Communist Party between 1934 and 1937 to promote the Chinese revolutionary movement. A French comrade who was responsible for distributing the newspaper at that time overcame many difficulties to preserve a copy, and now this comrade entrusted Frachon to give the newspaper he had saved to the congress as a souvenir. Liu Zihui, the executive chairman, thanked the French worker brothers for their congratulations on behalf of the congress, saying that these gifts proved that the Chinese workers and the French workers have a long-standing fighting friendship.

    Rudi Haiponel, member of the Presidium of the Free German Trade Union Federation, extended warm congratulations to the congress. He said that we highly value the experience you have accumulated during the Chinese socialist revolution, which creatively enriches Marxism-Leninism and flexibly applies Marxist dialectics in the specific conditions of your country. He said that in the struggle against West German militarism and revanchism, German workers are realizing their great task - striving for the reunification of Germany and making it a peaceful, democratic, and anti-imperialist country, and ensuring peace in Europe. When German workers are fighting, we believe that we will get the support of workers in Europe and all over the world. Haiponel presented the congress with gifts such as film projectors.

    Xia Shuzhang (member of the Guangzhou Education Trade Union Committee, professor of Sun Yat-sen University) said that educational trade unions bear a greater responsibility for cultivating the ranks of intellectuals of the working class. At present, the main problem in the intellectual circles is to further strengthen self-reform, carry out socialist revolution ideologically, and pass the socialist test well.

    Dange, representative of the All-India Trade Union Congress, said in his address that he brought to the Chinese working people the greetings of goodwill, love and friendship of the Indian working people. He also congratulated the congress on behalf of the All-India Trade Union Congress and its General Secretary Dange. He was convinced that this congress of the Chinese Trade Union would provide beneficial experience for the work of the Indian Trade Union.

    Zhang Zhiyuan (Vice Chairman of the Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions) introduced the main situation of the work of the Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions in his speech. He said that we plan to seriously correct various shortcomings in our work through rectification, change our work style, more closely connect with the masses, mobilize and organize the workers and staff of the province to deeply carry out socialist competitions, and strive to complete the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    Jono, General Secretary of the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union Federation, said in his address that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese workers and the entire people have made great achievements. At present, Indonesian workers and people of all strata are carrying out the struggle to eliminate the remnants of Dutch colonial forces - the struggle to liberate West Irian. Indonesian workers thank the Chinese workers for their firm attitude in supporting the liberation of West Irian, and call on workers of all countries to condemn the Dutch colonialists for endangering Indonesian national independence. When he spoke, all the representatives stood up and applauded warmly twice to express their support for the struggle of Indonesian workers and people of all strata to liberate West Irian.

    Huang Minwei (Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Electrical Industry Trade Union) said in his speech that during the Second Five-Year Plan, the development speed of China's power industry will be faster and the construction scale will be larger. Faced with such a grand and arduous task, the organizations at all levels of the Electrical Industry Trade Union must mobilize the workers and staff to extensively and deeply carry out socialist competitions, and complete and overfulfill the Second Five-Year Plan in a more, faster, better and more economical way.

    Đuro Salaj, Chairman of the Central Council of the Confederation of Trade Unions of Yugoslavia, conveyed the respect of the Yugoslav trade unions to the Chinese working class and all the people in his speech. He said that we sincerely hope to better understand the Chinese trade union movement, so that the trade unions of China and Yugoslavia can establish closer cooperative relations and further deepen and expand mutual understanding. After his address, Salaj presented gifts to the congress.

    Yan Chunhong (process engineer and model worker of Tianjin Bicycle Factory) said in his speech that in the future, he must follow the teachings of the Party, unite all the engineering and technical personnel of the factory, humbly learn from advanced experience, work hard to study politics to improve his awareness, and help young workers improve their skills to meet the needs of production development.
