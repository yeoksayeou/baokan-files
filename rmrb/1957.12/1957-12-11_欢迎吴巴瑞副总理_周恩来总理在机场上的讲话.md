    Welcoming Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe
    Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Airport
    Respected Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe, Your Excellency: Friends, Comrades:
    We are very pleased to welcome the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense of the Union of Burma, U Ba Swe, His Excellency, and his wife, as well as other Burmese friends who have come with him. We are deeply honored that you have graciously accepted the invitation of the Chinese government to visit China on a friendly basis.
    Since gaining independence, China and Burma, through the joint efforts of the two governments and peoples, have seen a significant increase in traditional friendship between the two countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In this regard, His Excellency U Ba Swe has made admirable contributions. During his tenure as Prime Minister of the Union of Burma in December 1956, His Excellency U Ba Swe invited me and Vice Premier He Long to visit Burma. Later, His Excellency U Ba Swe accepted the invitation of the Chinese government to attend the Sino-Burmese Border Residents' Get-Together held in Mangshi, China, further strengthening the friendship between the two peoples. Today, we are very happy to have the opportunity to reciprocate His Excellency U Ba Swe's kindness in Beijing.
    Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, the Chinese people warmly welcomed Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein to our country a few days ago. Today, we welcome Your Excellency's visit with the same warm feelings. We believe that the simultaneous visits of two outstanding Burmese political activists to our country will make the bonds of friendship between our two neighboring countries even closer. Let us shout:
    Long live the "Pauk Phaw" (brotherly) friendship between the people of China and Burma!

    欢迎吴巴瑞副总理
    周恩来总理在机场上的讲话尊敬的吴巴瑞副总理阁下：朋友们，同志们：
    我们以十分愉快的心情，欢迎缅甸联邦副总理兼国防部长吴巴瑞阁下和他的夫人以及同来的其他缅甸朋友们。你们盛情接受中国政府的邀请来中国作友好访问，中国政府和中国人民深感荣幸。
    中国和缅甸在获得独立以后，由于两国政府和人民的共同努力，两国之间的传统友谊在和平共处五项原则的基础上有了显著的增进。在这方面，吴巴瑞阁下曾经作出了令人钦佩的贡献。吴巴瑞阁下在1956年12月担任缅甸联邦总理期间，邀请我和贺龙副总理访问缅甸。以后，吴巴瑞阁下接受了中国政府的邀请，出席了在中国芒市举行的中缅边民联欢大会，进一步加强了两国人民的友谊。今天我们能够有机会在北京答谢吴巴瑞阁下的这种隆情厚意，感到十分高兴。
    副总理阁下，中国人民几天以前曾经热烈地欢迎吴觉迎副总理阁下来我国访问。今天，我们又以同样热烈的情绪欢迎阁下的来访。我们相信，缅甸两位卓越的政治活动家同时访问我国，将使我们两个邻国之间友谊的纽带更加紧密。让我们高呼
    中缅两国人民的“胞波”（兄弟）友谊万岁！
