Xinhua News Agency, December 4th—Through resolute struggle, cadres of the Ministry of Supervision recently exposed a rightist element, Wang Han, who had long infiltrated the Party and usurped the positions of Deputy Minister and Deputy Secretary of the Party Leadership Group in the Ministry of Supervision. This struggle is a major victory achieved by supervisory organs nationwide on the anti-rightist struggle front.

Rightist Wang Han had been a member of the Party for twenty-five years. He consistently distorted and opposed Marxism-Leninism, attacked socialism, and praised capitalism. For several years, in his work at the Ministry of Supervision, he colluded with rightist elements Peng Da, Chen Dazhi, and others, forming an anti-Party clique headed by him, opposing the instructions and resolutions of the CCP Central Committee and the Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Supervision regarding supervisory work. They attempted to seize leadership of the supervisory organs, place them above the Party and government, and use them as tools against the Party and socialism. Now his reactionary face has been completely exposed.

When the rectification campaign began, Wang Han thought his opportunity had come. He spread dissatisfaction with the Party Leadership Group everywhere, slandered other members of the Party Leadership Group, and engaged in sowing discord. He also instigated members of his anti-Party clique to launch wild attacks on the Party Leadership Group during the period of "blooming and contending," falsely claiming that "the Party Leadership Group is a paper tiger, easily punctured." His aim was to use the rectification campaign to topple the Party Leadership Group and seize leadership of the Ministry of Supervision, in order to implement his set of anti-Party proposals.

After the anti-rightist struggle, Wang Han openly sabotaged the anti-rightist struggle in order to shield his anti-Party clique, going to great lengths to defend several rightist elements within the Ministry of Supervision. When the Second Division of the Ministry of Supervision criticized the anti-socialist statements of rightist Peng Da, Wang Han immediately sensed that he would be difficult to hide. He tried every means to protect Peng Da, saying: "Those who truly curse their mothers (referring to cursing the Communist Party and socialism) are not necessarily poisonous weeds. Isn't there Jiao Da in the Dream of the Red Chamber? Jiao Da curses very fiercely, but he is a loyal servant of the Jia family." When the rectification leadership group of the Ministry of Supervision determined Peng Da to be a rightist, Wang Han immediately tipped off Peng Da, talking secretly into the night, telling Peng Da about the process of determining him a rightist. On August 13, at an enlarged meeting of the ministry leadership group to discuss the Central Committee's instructions on the anti-rightist struggle and to study the deployment of the anti-rightist struggle in the Ministry of Supervision, Wang Han openly challenged the Party Leadership Group at this meeting, flew into a rage, and threatened: "If you classify me as a rightist (Wang Han had not been classified as a rightist at the time), I won't come to the meeting tomorrow." That evening, he wrote a letter to the Party Leadership Group to threaten them.

For a long time, Wang Han frequently spread fallacies against Marxism-Leninism, slandered revolutionary teachers and leading comrades of the Party Central Committee, advocated the abolition of class struggle, promoted compromising ideas, and distorted the theory of Party building. When the Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Supervision was studying the "Eighth National Congress" documents, Wang Han distorted the Party's general line during the transition period, believing that after the change in the ownership of the means of production, the transition period was over. That is to say, after capitalist industry and commerce implemented joint state-private ownership, class struggle would cease, and the bourgeoisie would not need to be transformed. The Party Leadership Group criticized his fallacy, but he did not take it seriously and continued to spread it everywhere. He also viciously attacked the various social reform movements led by the Party, saying that the various social reform movements "always start by opposing the right and end by opposing the left, and in the end, nothing is achieved." He believed that the struggle against the landlord class during the land reform was excessive and should have been more moderate, and he harbored resentment for his landlord family being struggled against.

Wang Han greatly distorted and slandered the Marxist-Leninist theory of Party building. He fabricated rumors, saying that Lenin only united with traitors like Trotsky and did not wage struggle against them. He distorted Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "On Inner-Party Struggle" into "On Inner-Party Compromise" and frequently spread this fallacy among cadres, using it to prevent criticism of undesirable tendencies within the Party, attempting to abolish ideological struggle within the Party. He viciously slandered the history and class background of the great revolutionary teachers and leading comrades of the Party Central Committee, and under the guise of opposing the theory of sole class origin, he advocated that Party members should not be developed from those with good class backgrounds, but should absorb intellectuals from exploiting class backgrounds who had not been transformed into the Party, and even advocated bringing some people with unclear political history and who had not been strictly vetted into the Party. In particular, he consistently undermined the Party's democratic centralism, was not bound by Party discipline, often treated Party meetings as clubs for chatting and gossiping, arbitrarily distorted the Party's policies and violated Party resolutions. His words and actions were an attempt to abolish the basic principles of Lenin's theory of Party building and to transform the working class party with bourgeois ideology.

Wang Han attacked the socialist system in many ways. He could not stand anything about socialist New China, negated the achievements of our socialist construction, slandered the work of the various ministries of the State Council as "a complete mess," and attacked our country's plans for developing the national economy as either "rash advances" or "rash retreats." He also said that the current university education and construction projects were not as good as before liberation, thereby praising the old society and belittling the new society. He greatly admired Huang Shaohong's anti-socialist remarks and boasted about Huang Shaohong everywhere. He himself also spread the fallacy that the socialist system had a dark side. In order to negate the superiority of the socialist system, he often praised the political, economic, and cultural and educational systems of capitalism among young cadres. Wang Han's worship of the United States was also extremely serious. He insisted on using the American bourgeois scholar Dewey's "Decimal Classification" to organize the archives of the supervisory organs, opposing the State Archives Bureau's regulations on organizing the archives of state organs. He boasted that the American missiles were "brilliant," praised the sound management and excellent products of capitalist factories and mines, and even insisted on buying American milk powder for his children.

For several years, Wang Han has consistently opposed the instructions and resolutions of the CCP Central Committee and the Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Supervision on some fundamental issues of supervisory work, attempting to implement his set of supervisory work proposals that were opposed to the Party, wanting to place the supervisory organs above the Party and government. He insisted that the contradiction between the supervisory organs and the supervised departments was irreconcilable, and that if the supervisory organs belonged to someone, they could not supervise that person. He believed that the supervisory organs should not only regularly and comprehensively check the implementation of state plans, resolutions, and orders, but also check the formulation of state plans and resolutions, believing that only in this way could they grasp "major problems of paramount importance and hit the key points"; he opposed the supervisory organs checking accidents and cases of illegal and dereliction of duty, as well as handling citizen complaints, believing that these tasks were "trivial and insignificant." He even advocated "treating people with virtue" for those who seriously violated laws and discipline. He firmly advocated engaging in "ex-ante supervision" and having a "supreme sword," which meant having the power to suspend payments and impose fines on financial and economic departments; he opposed the supervisory organs relying on Party and government leaders at all levels and the broad masses to carry out their work, slandering the mass line as "abstract," believing that the mass line did not solve the problem in supervisory work. On the issue of the system, he insisted on a vertical leadership system and insisted on having the authority to manage supervisory cadres at all levels; he opposed the central government's decision to change the system of supervisory departments to dual leadership. He also consistently opposed strengthening the political and ideological leadership of supervisory organs and opposed supervisory cadres studying Marxism-Leninism, saying "without business, there is no politics, business is politics," he also tried his best to control the overall work of the Ministry of Supervision by adjusting the organization and division of labor of the leadership.

In order to realize the above-mentioned anti-Party proposals, Wang Han and his anti-Party clique consistently adopted a double-dealing approach in their daily work, agreeing in person and opposing behind their backs to the instructions and resolutions of the Central Committee and the Party Leadership Group, and often opposed the Party Leadership Group. Especially before and after the Sixth National Supervisory Work Conference last year, Wang Han tried his best to oppose the Central Committee's decision on dual leadership and the resolutions of the Sixth National Supervisory Work Conference. When this conspiracy failed, he spread rumors everywhere, saying that the Sixth National Supervisory Work Conference did not solve the problem, that it was a "deflated conference," that it "increased the burden on cadres, that dual leadership brought many disasters to the supervisory organs, and that the supervisory organs were about to collapse," and so on.

Wang Han and his anti-Party clique also frequently attacked others and elevated themselves, slandering members of the Party Leadership Group as not understanding business, that this one was not good, and that one was not good either. They echoed each other and praised each other. Wang Han boasted that "Peng Da is an expert in industrial supervision work, an all-rounder"; Peng Da boasted that "Wang Han is a talented person, the only one in the Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Supervision who is familiar with business, and the Ministry of Supervision cannot do without Wang Han." Wang Han boasted that "Chen Dazhi is capable"; Chen Dazhi also said that "Wang Han is talented, when he first came to the People's Supervisory Commission of the State Council, he put forward opinions one after another, and now he is suppressed and cannot play a role." Peng Da, Chen Dazhi even boasted that Wang Han should be elected as a member of the Central Committee and even hinted that he should be the Minister of Supervision. Wang Han also cultivated some people and attacked some people among the cadres, in an attempt to expand his anti-Party clique.

The anti-Party activities of Wang Han and his anti-Party clique in supervisory work caused great confusion in the thinking of supervisory cadres, especially supervisory cadres in the industrial and transportation systems, and caused great resistance to the Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Supervision in implementing the Central Committee's instructions and decisions, causing serious harm to supervisory work.

Wang Han's series of anti-Marxist-Leninist, anti-socialist words and actions were based on a set of extremely reactionary ideological logic. He also frequently used relativism and sophistry to reverse black and white, confuse right and wrong, and defend his anti-Party activities. In order to insist on ex-ante supervision and oppose the Central Committee's instructions on ex-post inspection, he said that "ex-ante is ex-post, there is no absolute distinction between ex-ante and ex-post." In order to insist on implementing vertical leadership and oppose the Central Committee's decision on dual leadership, he said that "dual and vertical have their own advantages and disadvantages, it is difficult to say whether dual is better or vertical is better." He also frequently spread fallacies such as "the more abstract, the more concrete, the more concrete, the more abstract," "no matter what, it means to take care of everything," and "if the problem is not solved, the problem is solved," in order to create confusion and negative emotions among cadres.

Wang Han's anti-Party activities have been going on for a long time. As early as when he was doing underground work in northern Hubei, he did not implement the instructions of the higher Party committee and violated the principles of secret work, causing serious damage to the underground Party organization and causing significant losses. When he was doing political work in the army, he cultivated some young intellectual cadres with bad ideological character, attacked veteran worker-peasant cadres, and engaged in factional activities against the Party and leadership. He also opposed the local Party committee and government, seriously divorced himself from the masses, infringed on the interests of the masses, and caused serious adverse effects on the Party and the army. When he was working in the Central and Southern Supervisory Committee, he also spread many rumors about the Central and Southern Bureau of the CCP Central Committee.

Wang Han also blindly pursued a bourgeois lifestyle, becoming corrupt and degenerate.

After rightist Wang Han was exposed, the anti-rightist struggle in the Ministry of Supervision formed an unprecedented climax. From October 31 to November 6, and from November 25 to 27, the Ministry of Supervision successively held sixteen staff meetings to struggle against Wang Han, posted more than 1,100 big-character posters exposing and criticizing Wang Han's anti-Party words and deeds, and held an exhibition of evidence of Wang Han's serious irresponsibility and deliberately creating chaos in his work. In addition to sending people to attend the meetings to struggle against Wang Han, the supervisory bureaus of the central industrial and transportation departments also organized supervisory cadres to go to the Ministry of Supervision to see big-character posters and Wang Han's exhibition of evidence. They were extremely indignant at Wang Han's anti-Party words and deeds and expressed their determination to fight Wang Han to the end with the comrades of the Ministry of Supervision and resolutely eliminate the ideological confusion caused by Wang Han and his anti-Party clique among supervisory cadres. Everyone believed that the exposure of Wang Han, this rightist element, was not only a major victory in the anti-rightist struggle of the Ministry of Supervision, but also a major victory for supervisory organs nationwide. In the face of a large amount of evidence, Wang Han had to admit that his "crimes were profound, his soul was ugly, and he was a rightist element who was against the Party, against the people, and against socialism."

　  监察机关反右派斗争取得重大胜利
　　彻底斗倒反党分子王翰
    新华社4日讯　监察部的干部经过坚决的斗争，最近挖掘出一个长期混在党内窃取监察部副部长、党组副书记职务的右派分子王翰。这个斗争是全国监察机关在反右派斗争战线上所取得的重大胜利。
    右派分子王翰入党二十五年之久，他一贯曲解和反对马列主义，攻击社会主义，赞扬资本主义。几年来，他在监察部工作中，同右派分子彭达、陈达之等人勾结起来，形成了以他为首的反党集团，反对中共中央和监察部党组关于监察工作的指示和决议，企图夺取监察机关的领导权，把监察机关置于党和政府之上，利用监察机关作为反党反社会主义的工具，现在他的反动面目已完全暴露出来。
    整风开始，王翰认为时机来到，到处散布对党组的不满情绪，诽谤党组其他成员，进行挑拨离间；并且策动他的反党集团分子，在鸣放期间大肆攻击党组，诬蔑“党组是纸老虎，一戳就破”。他的目的是企图利用整风，搞垮党组，夺取监察部的领导权，以便实现他的一套反党主张。
    反右派斗争以后，王翰为包庇他的反党集团，竟公开破坏反右派斗争，极力为监察部的几个党内右派分子辩护。当监察部第二司批判右派分子彭达的反社会主义言论时，王翰即察觉到他难以隐藏下去，千方百计地包庇彭达，他说：“真正骂娘的人（指骂共产党和社会主义），不一定是毒草。红楼梦不是有个焦大吗？焦大是骂得很凶的，但他是贾府的忠实奴才。”当监察部整风领导小组确定彭达为右派分子后，王翰立即向彭达通风报信，密谈到深夜，将确定彭达为右派分子的经过情况告许彭达。8月13日，部领导小组扩大会议讨论中央关于反右派斗争的指示和研究监察部反右派斗争的部署时，王翰在这个会议上，竟公然向党组挑战，大发脾气，威胁说：“你们把我划成右派了（当时并未把王翰划为右派），明天我不来参加会了。”当晚又给党组写信进行威胁。
    长期以来，王翰经常散布反对马克思列宁主义的谬论，诽谤革命导师和党中央的领导同志，主张取消阶级斗争，宣传妥胁思想，歪曲建党学说。王翰在监察部党组学习“八大”文件时，歪曲党在过渡时期的总路线，认为在生产资料所有制改变以后，过渡时期就结束了。这就是说，资本主义工商业实行公私合营以后，阶级斗争就息灭，资产阶级不需要进行改造。党组批评了他的这一谬论，他不以为然，仍到处散布。并且恶毒地攻击党所领导的历次社会改革运动，说历次社会改革运动“总是一开始反右，最后反左，结果是什么名堂也搞不出来”。他认为改革土地制度时对地主阶级的斗争过火了，应该温和一些，并对自己的地主家庭被斗心怀不满。
    王翰对马克思列宁主义的建党学说，大肆进行歪曲和诬蔑。他造谣说，列宁对托洛茨基等叛徒只是团结，不进行斗争。他把刘少奇同志的“论党内斗争”歪曲成“论党内妥协”，并且经常在干部中散布这一谬论，借此阻止在党内向不良倾向开展批评，企图取消党内思想斗争。他恶毒地诽谤伟大的革命导师和党中央的领导同志的历史和阶级出身，并且以反对唯成分论为幌子，主张发展党员不要找成分好的，而要吸收那些未经改造的剥削阶级出身的知识分子入党，甚至主张把一些政治历史不清、未经严格审查的人也拉进党内来。尤其是他一贯地破坏党内民主集中制，不受党的纪律约束，经常把党的会议当成吹谈聊天的俱乐部，任意地歪曲党的方针政策，违背党的决议。他的这些言行，是企图取消列宁主义建党的基本原则，而以资产阶级的思想来改造工人阶级的政党。
    王翰多方地攻击社会主义制度。他对社会主义的新中国的一切都看不惯，否定我国社会主义建设的成绩，诬蔑国务院各部的工作是“一塌糊涂”，攻击我国发展国民经济计划不是“冒进”就是“冒退”。他还说，现在的大学教育和建筑工程都不如解放以前，以此歌颂旧社会，贬低新社会。他对黄绍竑的反社会主义言论十分赞赏，并到处替黄绍竑吹嘘。他自己也散布社会主义制度有阴暗面的谬论。他为了否定社会主义制度的优越性，经常在青年干部中赞扬资本主义的政治、经济和文化教育制度。王翰的崇美思想也极为严重。他坚持要用美国资产阶级学者杜威的“图书十进分类法”来整理监察机关的档案，反对国家档案局关于整理国家机关档案的规定。他吹嘘美国的导弹“高明”，赞扬资本主义的厂矿企业经营完善和产品的优美，甚至连他的小孩吃奶粉也一定要买美国货。
    几年来，王翰一贯反对中共中央和监察部党组关于监察工作一些根本性问题的指示和决议，企图贯彻他的与党对立的一套监察工作主张，想把监察机关置于党和政府之上。他硬说监察机关与被监督部门的矛盾是不可调和的，监察机关从属于谁，就不能监督谁。他认为监察机关不仅要经常地全面地检查国家计划和决议、命令的执行情况，而且要检查国家计划和决议的制定，认为只有这样作，才能抓住“有头等意义的大问题，打中要害”；他反对监察机关检查事故和违法失职的案件以及处理公民控诉工作，认为这些工作是“鸡毛蒜皮，意义不大”。他甚至对严重违法乱纪分子，主张“爱人以德”。他坚决主张搞“事先监督”，要有“上方宝剑”，这也就是说要有对财经部门行使停止支付、罚款等权力；反对监察机关依靠各级党政领导和广大群众进行工作，诬蔑群众路线是“抽象”的，认为监察工作走群众路线不解决问题。在体制问题上，他坚持要搞垂直领导，坚持要有管理各级监察干部的权限；反对中央关于监察部门体制改为双重领导的决定。他还一贯反对加强监察机关的政治思想领导，反对监察干部学习马列主义，说什么“没有业务那有政治，业务就是政治”，他还费尽心机地企图以调整机构和领导分工来达到控制监察部的全盘工作的目的。
    王翰及其反党集团为了实现上述的反党主张，在日常工作中一贯地采取阳奉阴违的两面手法，对中央和党组的指示和决议，当面同意，背后反对，经常和党组闹对立。特别是去年第六次全国监察工作会议前后，王翰竭力反对中央关于双重领导的决定和第六次全国监察工作会议的决议。他的这一阴谋未能得逞，就到处散布流言蜚语，说第六次全国监察工作会议没有解决问题，是“泄气会”，“给干部增加包袱，双重领导给监察机关带来许多灾难，监察机关快要垮台”等等。
    王翰及其反党集团还经常打击别人，抬高自己，诬蔑党组成员不懂业务，这个不行，那个也不行。他们一呼一应，互相吹捧。王翰夸耀“彭达是工业监察工作专家，是全才”；彭达则吹嘘“王翰是才子，监察部党组成员中唯有王翰熟悉业务，监察部离开王翰不行。”王翰夸耀“陈达之能干”；陈达之也说“王翰有才华，初来前政务院人民监察委员会时一套套的发表意见，现在受压抑不能发挥作用。”彭达、陈达之甚至吹嘘王翰应该当选中央委员，并且暗示应该当监察部长。王翰还在干部中拉拢一些人，打击一些人，企图扩大他的反党集团。
    王翰及其反党集团在监察工作上的反党活动，使监察干部，特别是工业、交通系统的监察干部思想上发生了很大混乱，使监察部党组在贯彻中央的指示和决定时，遭到了极大的阻力，给监察工作造成了严重的危害。
    王翰这一系列的反马列主义、反社会主义的言行，是有他一套极端反动的思想逻辑为基础的。他并且经常用相对主义和诡辩的方法来颠倒黑白，混淆是非，为他的反党活动进行辩护。他为了坚持搞事先监督，反对中央关于事后检查的指示，就说“事先就是事后，事先事后没有绝对区别”。他为了坚持实行垂直领导，反对中央关于双重领导的决定，就说“双重、垂直各有利弊，双重好，还是垂直好，很难说”。他还经常散布“越抽象就越具体，越具体就越抽象”、“什么都不管，也就什么都管了”、“不解决问题，问题也就解决了”等谬论，以此在干部中制造混乱和消极情绪。
    王翰的反党活动是由来已久的。他早在鄂北作地下工作时，就不执行上级党委的指示，违反秘密工作的原则，使地下党的组织遭到严重破坏，造成重大损失。他在军队作政治工作时，拉拢一些思想品质不好的青年知识分子干部，打击工农老干部，进行反党反领导的宗派活动。他还同地方党委和政府闹对立，严重地脱离人民群众，侵犯人民群众的利益，给党和军队造成了严重的不良影响。他在中南监察委员会工作时，对中共中央中南局也散布了许多流言蜚语。
    王翰还一味追求资产阶级的生活方式，腐化堕落。
    右派分子王翰被挖出后，监察部的反右派斗争形成了前所未有的高潮。10月31日至11月6日，11月25日至27日，监察部连续召开了十六次斗争王翰的全体工作人员大会，张贴了揭发批判王翰反党言行的大字报一千一百多张，并举办了王翰在工作中严重不负责任、故意制造混乱的罪证展览会。中央工业、交通部门的监察局除派人参加斗争王翰的大会外，还组织监察干部到监察部看大字报和王翰的罪证展览会。他们对王翰的反党言行极为愤慨，表示要与监察部的同志一道和王翰斗争到底，坚决肃清王翰及其反党集团在监察干部中造成的思想混乱。大家认为，王翰这个右派分子被揭露，不仅是监察部反右派斗争的重大胜利，而且是全国监察机关的重大胜利。王翰在大量罪证面前，不得不承认自己“罪恶深重，灵魂丑恶，是反党反人民反社会主义的右派分子”。
