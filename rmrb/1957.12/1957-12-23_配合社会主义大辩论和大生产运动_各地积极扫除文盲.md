Xinhua News Agency, December 21st - Various rural areas are actively carrying out literacy campaigns in coordination with the socialist great debate and the winter great production movement.

According to the plans proposed by seventeen provinces and cities including Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shandong, and Hubei, this winter and next spring, 44.42 million to 47.32 million illiterate peasant farmers will participate in literacy school learning. Among them, twelve provinces and cities plan to eliminate illiteracy for 4.35 million to 4.8 million people this winter and next spring. Hunan Province, while actively organizing illiterate peasant farmers to enroll in school, plans to cultivate 100 key literacy townships and 1,000 key literacy cooperatives within two years. Key townships are required to basically organize illiterate people aged 14 to 50 to enroll in school within two years, with a student retention rate of over 70%, and to eliminate illiteracy in the entire township within three to four years. Key cooperatives are required to basically organize all illiterate people to enroll in school this year, with a student retention rate of 80%, and to basically eliminate illiteracy within three years.

Before launching the literacy campaign this winter, more than half of the provinces and cities across the country, combined with the characteristics of this year's rural areas, successively held literacy work conferences or peasant cultural education conferences, and issued instructions for literacy work. Counties and townships also made full preparations.

The areas where literacy work is currently carried out well have proven that as long as it can be closely coordinated with the socialist great debate and the rural great production movement, literacy work can be carried out well. In Hou Lizhuang Township, Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, during the socialist great debate, the question was raised: "Is it good to be literate, or is it good to be an illiterate?" After the debate, the masses composed a jingle: "It's really good to be literate, you can read books and newspapers, you know the major events, guidelines and policies of the country, and you will no longer be deceived by landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements!" The masses also put forward the slogan "The earth is the blackboard, the field is the classroom, and production and learning keep up." In Suiping County, Henan Province, some production team leaders or teachers in the literacy school formed propaganda and debate groups with students. While conducting the socialist great debate, they carried out guaranteed teaching and learning or self-study before and after the meetings. Guangxi Province proposed methods for seizing learning time such as "learn every other evening when there is a meeting, learn every evening when there is no meeting," "learn before small meetings, learn in the fields during production," etc. In the farm township of Hong'an County, Hubei Province, on the construction site of thirty waterwheels, methods such as "sticking characters on each waterwheel" and "hanging blackboards under the work sheds" were adopted for study during rest time, so that 4,703 students in 218 literacy schools also persisted in learning during the great production.

This year, the educated youth and cadres sent to lower levels in rural areas have become a strong literacy army. More than half of the literacy teachers in many places are graduates of senior primary schools and cadres sent to lower levels. In Wu Xiang County, Shanxi Province, because there are more literate people, it is possible to carry out a flexible and decentralized people-run education movement of assigning people, households, teams, cooperatives, and townships according to different literacy targets. In Jianli County, Hubei Province, each township trained 2,777 literacy teachers. Now some townships have reached the point where every team has a teacher, and the general townships have also reached the point where 80% of the teams have a teacher.

After several years of literacy work, the proportion of illiterate people in rural areas has gradually decreased. In many areas, the proportion of illiterate farmers has decreased from more than 80% in the past to about 70%. The proportion of illiterate farmers in Beijing, Shanxi, Jilin and other provinces and cities has decreased to below 60%.

### 配合社会主义大辩论和大生产运动  各地积极扫除文盲

    配合社会主义大辩论和大生产运动
    各地积极扫除文盲
    据新华社21日讯  各地农村正配合社会主义大辩论和冬季大生产运动，积极开展扫盲工作。
    根据河北、河南、山西、山东、湖北等十七个省市所提出的规划，今冬明春将有四千四百四十二万到四千七百三十二万农民文盲参加民校学习，其中有十二个省市准备在今冬明春扫除文盲四百三十五万到四百八十万。湖南省在积极组织农民文盲入学的同时，准备在两年内培养一百个扫盲重点乡，一千个扫盲重点社。重点乡要求在两年内把十四至五十岁的文盲基本上组织入学，学员巩固率达到70％以上，三、四年内扫除全乡文盲；重点社要求在今年内把文盲基本上都组织入学，学员巩固率达到80％，三年内基本上扫除文盲。
    在今冬开展扫盲工作以前，全国半数以上的省市结合着今年农村的特点，先后召开了扫盲工作会议或农民文化教育会议，并且发出了扫盲工作的指示。各县、乡也作了充分准备。
    目前扫盲工作开展得好的地区证明，只要能够紧密地配合社会主义大辩论和农村大生产运动，扫盲工作是能够开展得好的。山东省寿张县后李庄乡在社会主义大辩论时，出了个题目是：“有文化好，睁眼瞎好？”辩论以后，群众编了个顺口溜：“识了字真正好，能看书会看报，国家大事、方针政策都知道，再不受地主富农、坏分子的欺骗了！”群众还提出了“大地当黑板，田间当课堂，生产学习紧跟上”的口号。河南省遂平县有的以民校中的生产队长或教师为主，把学员组成宣传辩论小组，一面进行社会主义大辩论，一面在会前会后开展包教保学或自学。广西省提出“有会隔晚学，无会晚晚学”“小会会前学，生产地里学”等抓学习时间的办法。湖北省红安县农场乡在三十架水车车水的工地上，采用了“车车贴字”和“工棚底下挂黑板”等办法，在休息时间学习，因而有二百一十八所民校的四千七百零三个学员在大生产中也坚持了学习。
    今年，各地农村中的知识青年和下放干部成了一支强有力的扫盲大军。很多地方的扫盲教师有一半以上是高小毕业生和下放干部。山西省武乡县由于识字的人多了，所以有可能根据不同的扫盲对象，开展灵活的分散的包人、包户、包队到包社、包乡的民教民运动。湖北省监利县由各个乡集训了扫盲教师二千七百七十七人，现在有的乡已经达到队队有教师，一般乡也达到80％的队有教师。
    经过几年来的扫盲工作，农村文盲的比例已经逐渐下降。很多地区农民中的文盲由过去的80％以上下降到70％左右。北京、山西、吉林等省市农民中的文盲已经下降到60％以下。
