Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 6th: Under the arrangement of the U.S. military authorities, the American soldier Girard, who shot and killed a Japanese woman, left Japan today on a U.S. military transport ship from Yokohama for the United States, taking with him the blood debt he owed to the Japanese people. Girard also took his Japanese wife, whom he married after committing the murder.

Girard had been sentenced by the Maebashi District Court in Japan to three years' imprisonment, suspended for four years. The Japanese public angrily condemned this verdict, which succumbed to American pressure, and generally demanded that Girard be appealed. However, the Japanese prosecution authorities finally decided on December 3 not to appeal Girard's case.

    新华社6日讯　东京消息：在美军当局的安排下，枪杀日本妇女的美国兵哲腊德，今天带着他对日本人民欠下的血债在横滨乘美军运输船离开日本前往美国。哲腊德还带走了他在犯杀人罪以后娶的日本籍妻子。
    哲腊德曾经被日本前桥地方裁判所判处徒刑三年，缓期四年执行。日本公众愤怒地指责这种屈服于美国的压力的判决，并且普遍要求对哲腊德上诉。但是，日本检察当局终于在12月3日决定不对哲腊德上诉。
