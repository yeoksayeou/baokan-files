    Remembering Brother Hong Shen
    Tian Han

    When "Not Afraid to Die" was being shown and scenes of insulting Chinese people appeared, Mr. Hong stood up and began an impassioned speech to the audience, arousing their national indignation. Many people shouted "Refund!", "We don't want to see it!" and "Down with imperialist films that insult Chinese people!" Sure enough, the foreign manager immediately interfered and dragged Mr. Hong to the manager's office. Comrades Zhang Shu, Jin Yan, and Liao Mosha followed him in, protecting Mr. Hong while opposing the foreign manager. Comrades Jin Yan and Zhang Shu were quite strong, and although Comrade Liao Mosha was less strong, his fighting spirit was high. When the foreign manager was wrestling with Mr. Hong, they also hit back hard at the foreign manager. Comrade Liao Mosha said he punched the foreign manager's leg several times. The foreign manager originally wanted to have Mr. Hong detained by the Public Works Department, but under the pressure of the angry crowd, fearing it would affect the future business of the Grand Theatre, he finally released Mr. Hong.

    When the "August 13th" Anti-Japanese War began and Shanghai organized the Drama Circle Salvation Performing Arts Troupe, Mr. Hong put in a great deal of effort. During the activities of the Second Salvation Performing Arts Troupe on both the north and south banks of the Yangtze River, Mr. Hong was both the head of the troupe, the playwright, and an actor, launching anti-Japanese propaganda regardless of fatigue. At the Third Department of the Political Department of the Military Commission in Wuhan, Mr. Hong, under the leadership of the Party, participated in organizing and training ten Anti-Japanese Drama Troupes, leaving a huge practical impact on in-depth anti-Japanese propaganda and the cultivation of revolutionary literary and artistic cadres. On the eve of the Changsha fire, Mr. Hong, following the instructions of Comrade Zhou Enlai, was responsible for arranging the evacuation of the staff of the Third Department, protecting progressive forces. When we returned to Changsha from Hengyang to fight the fire, using the former site of the Hunan Finance Department as a base, Mr. Hong assisted the Party in directing several Anti-Japanese Drama Troupes and other progressive literary and artistic forces to participate in the disaster relief movement for hundreds of thousands of citizens. Not only was the distribution of millions of yuan in relief funds praised as unprecedentedly clean and effective, but also, based on understanding the spirit of leadership, absorbing the wisdom of the masses, and strengthening preparatory measures, hundreds of thousands of citizens gathered in four or five squares safely received relief funds without any major accidents or losses. In these places, Mr. Hong demonstrated tremendous organizational and administrative talents.

    We must also not forget some of the moving scenes in Guilin. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, progressive cultural figures who stayed in Hong Kong entered the mainland one after another, gathering first in Guilin. Based on the materials and impressions of the returning comrades, I wrote "Goodbye, Hong Kong," which was directed by Mr. Hong and had already obtained a license and was about to be performed. The Kuomintang Central Special Agents, through the hands of Qiu Changwei, temporarily banned the play. Mr. Hong and Brother Ouyang Yuqian tried every means to save it, but to no avail. So Mr. Hong decided to carry out a struggle to expose the true colors of the reactionaries. After performing one scene, under the surveillance of on-site puppet military police, he went to the outside of the stage and explained the reason for the play being banned to the audience. He raised the license and said to everyone, "Comrades, 'Goodbye, Hong Kong' only expresses the Chinese people's anger at Japanese imperialism and their demand for persisting in the Anti-Japanese War and persisting in democracy. Such a play should be allowed, and the government has allowed it. This is the government's license for this play! The New China Theater Company, a poor organization, has invested all its manpower and resources in performing this play, and now it is suddenly and resolutely not allowed to be performed, and all the manpower and resources have been wasted. But we have to obey the government, and the following scenes have to be stopped. Thank you to the audience for your support and trust in 'New China.' Some tickets were pre-sold, and now the money has been prepared, so please comrades, return your tickets in an orderly manner."

    Mr. Hong spoke so sadly and restrainedly that the audience left with indignation and sympathy. Most of the people tore up their tickets to protest by not getting a refund.

    This is where you can best see Brother Hong Shen's true feelings.

    In 1928, when the South China Society was invited by the Guangdong Drama Research Institute, sponsored by Comrade Ouyang Yuqian, to perform in Guangzhou, Brother Shen and I lived upstairs in the Guanyin Mountain residence, and we had the opportunity to talk intimately in bed. What I still cannot forget is his discussion of the thought process of changing his studies to drama in the United States. He studied in the United States after graduating from Tsinghua University, initially studying ceramics. He also had some talent and originally wanted to make a difference in the industry after returning to China, that is, he wanted to be a pioneer of Chinese capitalism. Later, he had contact with the Jian family of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, served as the company's agent in the United States, and also served as the company's secretary after returning to China, which specifically illustrates this line of thought of his.

    忆洪深兄
    田汉
    在“不怕死”开映到出现侮辱华人的场面的时候，洪先生站起来了，他对观众开始激昂地演说，鼓动观众的民族义愤，许多人喊“退票！”，“我们不要看！”以及“打倒帝国主义侮辱中国人的影片！”等等。洋经理果然马上来干涉了，把洪先生扭到经理室，张曙、金燄、廖沫沙等同志也跟着进去，一面保护洪先生，一面反对洋经理。金燄、张曙同志是有些气力的，廖沫沙同志气力虽小，斗志却强，在洋经理扭打洪先生的时候，他们也狠狠地回击洋经理，廖沫沙同志说他在洋经理腿上打了好几拳。洋经理本来是要找工部局拘押洪先生的，但在愤怒群众的压力下，怕影响大光明今后的营业，终于把洪先生释放了。
    在“八·一三”抗战开始，上海组织戏剧界救亡演剧队的时候，洪先生出了很大的力。救亡演剧二队在长江南北岸活动中，洪先生又是团长，又是编剧，又是演员，不顾劳瘁，展开抗战宣传；在武汉军委政治部三厅，洪先生又在党的领导下参加组织训练十个抗敌演剧队，留下了深入抗战宣传，培养革命文艺干部的巨大实际影响；在长沙大火前夜，洪先生秉承周恩来同志的指示，负责安排三厅工作人员的撤退，保护进步力量。及至我们由衡阳折回长沙救火，以火后的湖南财政厅旧址做根据地，洪先生协助党指挥几个抗敌演剧队和其他进步文艺工作力量，投入对数十万市民的救灾运动，不只是发放千百万元赈款被誉为空前廉洁和有效，而且在体会领导精神、吸取群众智慧、加强准备措施的基础上使集合在四五个广场中的数十万市民群众安然领到赈款，没有发生什么重大事故、遭受什么损失。在这些地方，洪先生发挥了巨大的组织才能和行政才能。
    也不能忘记我们在桂林的一些动人的场面。太平洋战争爆发后，留香港的进步文化人纷纷进入内地，首先集合在桂林。我根据归国同志的材料和观感写成了“再会吧，香港”，由洪先生导演，已经取得许可证，就要开演了。国民党中央特务通过丘昌渭的手临时禁止了这个戏。洪先生和欧阳予倩兄多方设法进行了挽救，但是没有效果。于是洪先生决心进行揭露反动派面目的斗争。他在演出一场之后在临场伪军警的监视下走到幕外，对观众说明戏被禁止的原委，他举起许可证对大家说：“同志们，‘再会吧，香港’只不过表达了中国人民对日本帝国主义的愤怒，和要求坚持抗战，坚持民主。这样的戏是应该被许可的，政府也许可了，这是政府对这个戏的许可证！新中国剧社这个穷团体为了演出这个戏投下了所有的人力物力，现在忽然又坚决不让演了，人力物力都白费了。但是我们得服从政府，以下几幕戏只好停下来了。感谢观众们对‘新中国’的支持和信任，有的票子还是预售的，现在钱已经设法准备好了，请同志们有秩序地退票吧。”
    洪先生说得那样沉痛而有节制，观众们怀着义愤和同情出场，绝大部分的人把票子都撕碎了，以不退票表示抗议。
    这种地方最能看出洪深兄的真情实感。
    在1928年南国社受欧阳予倩同志主办的广东戏剧研究所的邀请到广州公演的时候，深兄和我同住在观音山寓所楼上，我们有抵足谈心的机会。至今还不能忘记的是他谈起在美国改学戏剧的思想经过。他由清华留美，最初是学陶磁科的。他也有些干才，原想归国之后在实业方面有所施展，就是说想做一个中国资本主义的一员闯将吧。他后来跟南洋兄弟烟草公司简家有联系，担任过该公司在美国的代理人，回国后也任过公司的秘书，就具体说明他这一条思想线索。
