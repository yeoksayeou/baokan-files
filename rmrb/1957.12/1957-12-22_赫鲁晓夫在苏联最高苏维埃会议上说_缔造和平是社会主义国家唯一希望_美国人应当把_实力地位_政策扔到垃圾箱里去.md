Xinhua News Agency, December 21st dispatch from Moscow: TASS reported from Moscow that Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU and Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, spoke at the December 21st meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

    Khrushchev first spoke about the results of the Moscow meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries. He said that this meeting summarized the experience of the international communist and workers' movement and had great significance in the cause of striving for peace.

    When talking about the position of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia at the Moscow meeting, Khrushchev said that the representatives of that country signed the Peace Declaration. This was a major step forward in strengthening relations between fraternal parties. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia did not participate in the meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries. This shows that there are still differences on some ideological and political issues. However, the main thing is that these differences are getting smaller and smaller.

    Khrushchev emphasized that the enemies attempt to diminish the role of the Soviet Union in the revolutionary workers' movement and undermine its prestige, but they have not and will never succeed, just as no one can undermine the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties.

    Khrushchev pointed out that the consistent policy pursued by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries is to strengthen friendly relations between all countries, and to strengthen relations based on peaceful coexistence between countries with different political systems. He said, we want to advise the Americans: please throw your notorious "position of strength" policy into the trash can of history. Let us recognize the current reality and not interfere in the internal affairs of others. Contentious issues must be resolved through peaceful negotiations, not war.

    Khrushchev said that the victory of this or that social system is not determined by rockets and atomic bombs. The superiority of a social system will be proved by whether it creates better living conditions for the people. Socialist countries do not want to force anyone to accept their views; they have only one hope, and that is to create peace.

    Khrushchev then pointed out that Western countries have described all the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union on the issue of disarmament as propaganda. He said that this is indeed propaganda, but it is propaganda for peace, "We are willing to hear such peace propaganda from Western countries every day and every hour."

    When talking about the issue of disarmament, Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union has advocated in the past and still advocates a complete and unconditional ban on atomic weapons, the destruction of atomic weapon stockpiles, and a substantial reduction in armed forces and armaments, with the establishment of international supervision over these. Khrushchev expressed regret that all the proposals made by the Soviet Union on these issues had been rejected by Western countries. He said that the reason for not reaching an agreement was that the atmosphere of the London talks was very abnormal. There, the representatives of four Western countries were opposing one Soviet representative. At the same time, the representatives of Western countries used negotiations as a cover, creating the illusion that some results had been achieved in the negotiation process in order to confuse the public.

    Khrushchev commented on the United Nations resolution on the establishment of a new Disarmament Committee, saying that the Soviet Union will not participate in this committee because the balance of power within it is no different from the past, and the majority of seats in this committee will be occupied by capitalist countries. He said that the Soviet Union cannot agree to a policy where one side completely disregards the interests of the other.

    Khrushchev expressed regret over the fact that the recent United Nations meeting not only rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to establish a Disarmament Committee comprising all members of the United Nations, but also rejected Albania's amendment. He also pointed out that it cannot be considered normal to deliberately entangle the issue of disarmament with the resolution of unresolved political issues such as the German question.

    Khrushchev then talked about the recent NATO Paris meeting. He said that the representatives of the governments of the countries participating in this meeting were forced to talk about peace. The current situation forces them to do so. The declaration and communiqué adopted by the meeting stated that the participants intended to promote peace. Khrushchev pointed out that since this is the case, the issue of concluding a treaty of non-aggression between the Warsaw Pact member states and the NATO member states should be resolved. If this decision is made, it will be a good start and will be in the interests of all peace-loving people.

    Khrushchev pointed out that the heads of government of the countries participating in NATO said that they do not expect war and that they are taking measures only to defend against aggression. Khrushchev said that, however, no one has threatened Western countries, so this means that a good situation for consolidating peace is taking shape.

    Khrushchev continued by saying that in the future, the Soviet Union will also strive to stop the "Cold War" and the arms race. He said that the Soviet Union does not conceal the fact that if a disarmament agreement cannot be reached, then it will improve all kinds of the latest weapons. Khrushchev emphasized here that the Soviet Union will do so to a limited extent, so as not to overburden the Soviet budget, not to overburden the economy, and not to burden the people by spending a lot of money for this purpose.

    Regarding the issue of setting up ballistic missile launch bases and launch sites on the territories of various countries, Khrushchev said that under modern technological conditions, no aggressor can avoid retaliation. He welcomed the position of Norway and other countries in refusing to set up rocket weapons and atomic weapons bases on their territories. Khrushchev expressed surprise at the behavior of certain countries (including Italy and Turkey) that advocated establishing military bases on their territories. He said that in the event of war, atomic bases and rocket launch sites will become extremely attractive targets. Speaking here, Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union is not using these words to scare anyone, but to warn of the terrible danger facing all countries that allow the establishment of rocket weapons and atomic weapons bases on their territories.

    Khrushchev said that the establishment of atomic bomber bases by the United States on the territories of other countries is first and foremost a serious threat to the people of those countries where such bases are located. He said that the so-called "protective flights" of atomic bombers over the territories of these countries could have tragic consequences. Because any technology can malfunction, and then these countries will become victims of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons in peacetime. The public in all countries should do everything possible to end this adventure.

    Finally, Khrushchev expressed his belief that the upcoming 1958 will bring achievements in easing international tensions. He said that the Soviet government will do its utmost to completely or even partially eliminate the "Cold War" in this year.

    赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上说
    缔造和平是社会主义国家唯一希望
    美国人应当把“实力地位”政策扔到垃圾箱里去
    新华社21日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏共中央第一书记、苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃21日会议上发了言。
    赫鲁晓夫首先谈到了各国共产党和工人党代表莫斯科会议的结果。他说，这次会议综合了国际共产主义运动和工人运动的经验，它在争取和平的事业中有重大的意义。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟在莫斯科会议上的立场的时候说，这个国家的代表签署了和平宣言。这在加强兄弟党的关系方面是前进了很大的一步。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟没有参加社会主义国家共产党和工人党会议。这说明，在若干意识形态问题和政治问题上还存在着分歧。然而主要的是，这些分歧越来越小了。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，敌人企图降低苏联在革命工人运动中的作用和破坏它的威信，然而他们却没有、而且永远也不会得逞，正像没有人能够破坏共产党和工人党的团结一样。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家所一贯执行的方针是：加强一切国家之间的友好关系，加强以政治制度不同的国家和平共处为基础的关系。他说，我们要忠告美国人：请把你们那种声名狼籍的“实力地位”政策扔到历史的垃圾箱里去吧。让我们承认目前的现实情况，不要干涉别人的内政。争执问题不能通过战争、而必须通过和平谈判来解决。
    赫鲁晓夫说，这种或那种社会制度的胜利不是由火箭和原子弹决定的，社会制度的优越性将由是否为人们创造更好的生活条件来证明。社会主义国家不想强迫任何人接受自己的观点，它们只有一个希望，这就是缔造和平。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，西方国家把苏联就裁军问题发表的一切主张都说成是宣传。他说，这的确是宣传，不过这是在宣传和平，“我们愿意每日每时从西方国家那里听到这种和平宣传”。
    在谈到裁军问题的时候，赫鲁晓夫说，苏联过去主张、现在仍然主张全面地、无条件地禁止原子武器，销毁原子武器储备，主张大大裁减武装部队和军备并且对这些建立国际监督。赫鲁晓夫对苏联就这些问题提出的全部建议都遭到西方国家的拒绝一事表示遗憾。他说，所以没有达成协议，是因为伦敦谈判的气氛很不正常。在那里，有四个西方国家代表在反对一个苏联代表。同时，西方国家的代表们用谈判作幌子，造成一种在谈判过程中取得了某些结果的假象来混淆视听。
    赫鲁晓夫对联合国关于建立新裁军委员会的决议作了评价，他说，苏联将不参加这个委员会，因为其中的力量对比和过去没有不同，而且这个委员会中的大部分席位将被资本主义国家所占有。他说，苏联不能同意一方完全无视另一方利益的政策。
    赫鲁晓夫对以下的事实表示遗憾：最近一次联合国会议不仅否决了苏联关于建立一个包括联合国全体会员国的裁军委员会的建议，而且还否决了阿尔巴尼亚的修正案。他并且指出，不能认为故意把裁军问题同解决像德国问题这种悬而未决的政治问题纠缠在一起的做法是正常的。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到了最近举行的北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议。他说，这个会议参加国的政府的代表被迫谈到了和平。目前的局势迫使他们这样做。会议通过的宣言和公报说，会议的参加者打算促进和平。赫鲁晓夫指出，既然如此，华沙条约参加国同北大西洋公约组织参加国之间缔结互不侵犯条约的问题应当得到解决。如果作出这个决定，那将是一个良好的开端，并且将符合一切爱好和平人民的利益。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，参加北大西洋公约组织的国家的政府首脑说，他们不指望战争，他们采取措施只是为了防御侵略。赫鲁晓夫说，然而，谁也没有威胁西方国家，这么说来，这也就意味着巩固和平的良好局面正在形成。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，就是在将来苏联也要力求制止“冷战”和军备竞赛。他说，苏联毫不讳言，如果裁军协议不能达成，那么它就要改进各种最新式的武器。赫鲁晓夫在这里强调说，苏联在这方面将做到适可而止，以便不致使苏联的预算负担过重，不致使经济负担过重，不致由于把大量经费用于这个目的而使人民负担过重。
    关于在各国领土上设置弹道火箭发射基地和发射场的问题，赫鲁晓夫说，在现代的技术条件下，任何一个侵略者都不可能避免遭到报复。他欢迎挪威和其他国家拒绝在本国领土上设置火箭武器和原子武器基地的立场。赫鲁晓夫对某些国家（其中包括意大利和土耳其）主张在本国领土上建立军事基地的行为表示惊奇。他说，在战争中，原子基地和火箭发射场将成为极吸引人的目标。谈到这里，赫鲁晓夫说，苏联并不是拿这些话来吓唬任何人，而是提出警告：允许在本国领土上建立火箭武器和原子武器基地的一切国家，面临着多么可怕的危险。
    赫鲁晓夫说，美国在别国领土上建立原子轰炸机基地，这首先对这些境内有这种基地的国家的人民是一种严重威胁。他说，原子轰炸机在这些国家领土上空作所谓“保卫飞行”可能带来悲惨的后果。因为任何技术都可能出毛病，到那时，这些国家在和平时期都会成为原子武器和氢武器的牺牲品。各国公众应该竭尽全力来结束这种冒险。
    最后，赫鲁晓夫表示相信，即将到来的1958年将在缓和国际紧张局势方面带来成就。他说，苏联政府将尽最大努力来在这一年完全地或者即使是局部地消除“冷战”。
