    Xu Maoyong Incites Xiaopinwen Writers to Oppose the Party
    Shan Bai
    Xu Maoyong’s "The New Crisis of Xiaopinwen," written under the pseudonym Hui Chun (April 11, "People's Daily"), not only opposed some of the fundamental principles of our Party’s consistent advocacy of rectification within the people, but also insidiously incited Xiaopinwen writers. He used a provocative method, attempting to get them to use Xiaopinwen to oppose the Party and the people together.
    This rightist element, in an alarmist manner, said that Xiaopinwen is facing a "crisis of extinction" because socialist society has many "constraints" on Xiaopinwen. He opposed all these "constraints" and ridiculed them to his heart's content.
    When Xiaopinwen is used as a weapon of criticism within the people, it may encounter resistance from bureaucracy, dogmatism, and sectarianism. This is a kind of constraint and should be opposed. However, Xiaopinwen itself may also have errors and shortcomings, either the facts are inaccurate, or the position and attitude are incorrect, or the motives are impure, or the effect of the criticism is not conducive to socialism or the people. When such Xiaopinwen is met with counter-criticism, it should not complain about the environment, but rather examine itself. This is a "constraint" on Xiaopinwen itself. This self-"constraint" prevents Xiaopinwen from fully exerting its power, or even causes adverse consequences. Can the responsibility for this be pushed to the criticized party? Should there be "freedom" to scold and satirize at will, "freedom" from correct counter-criticism, "freedom" to harm the Party and the people and weaken socialism? If the "freedom" and "democracy" that Xu Maoyong demands are such "freedom" and "democracy," then he has reason to say that our society is "unfree" and "undemocratic."
    We all know that socialist society practices socialist democracy, which is a democratic system that is conducive to the consolidation and development of the new society, and is democratic centralism, not bourgeois "democracy," or petty-bourgeois anarchist "democracy." Abandoning centralism and only wanting "democracy" is not the democracy that our people need; opposing the leadership of the Party and only wanting individual "freedom" is not the freedom that our people need.
    However, what Xu Maoyong demands is precisely this kind of "democracy" and "freedom" in quotation marks. He opposes the idea that when criticizing shortcomings within the people, one must stand on the position of the people, the position of the working class, must adopt the attitude of treating illnesses to save people, and must follow the method of "unity—criticism—unity." He opposes these, and he mocks us for demanding "moderation and peace," demanding "no side effects," saying that doing so will cause Xiaopinwen to lose its "sharp characteristics."
    We do not generally oppose "sharpness." Criticism within the people can also be sharp and acute, but it is harmful and useless to talk about sharpness and acuteness abstractly, apart from the issue of position and attitude. Setting aside class stand, regardless of whether the object is the enemy, a friend, or ourselves, and generally demanding sharpness and acuteness will lead to a major mistake of confusing the enemy and ourselves, and there will be a danger of standing on the side of the enemy.
    Socialist democracy is a means to build a socialist society. Therefore, when implementing socialist democracy and carrying out criticism within the people, the issue of effect should be considered. If criticism has side effects that are not conducive to socialism, why can't we demand to avoid these side effects? Is demanding to avoid harming the interests of the people and the country a kind of "constraint" and "unfreedom" and "undemocratic"?
    To put it bluntly, what Xu Maoyong demands is nothing more than the extreme individual freedom of the bourgeoisie. He opposes requiring Xiaopinwen to avoid one-sidedness; he opposes Xiaopinwen being reviewed by newspaper and magazine editorial departments before publication; he opposes the simplification and clarification of Xiaopinwen's language; he opposes Xiaopinwen only acting as "penicillin" for junior cadres. On the contrary, he advocates that Xiaopinwen can only "highlight a certain aspect" and should not strive for comprehensiveness; he describes the editorial department's careful handling of manuscripts and carrying out editorial work under the leadership of the Party as: "being overly cautious" and "soliciting opinions from all kinds of people"; he advocates that authors have the right to "add a little knowledge that may not be known to everyone" in Xiaopinwen in order to engage in innuendo and personal attacks; he advocates that Xiaopinwen's spearhead should be directed at leading cadres and the Party. In a word, he advocates that Xiaopinwen become a weapon against the Party and the people!
    The words "socialist democracy" occasionally appear in Xu Maoyong's article, but he actually firmly opposes all the specific principles and methods of implementing socialist democracy. Is this considered supporting socialist democracy? Isn't this using socialist democracy as a guise, but actually opposing it, and attempting to replace socialist democracy with bourgeois democracy?
    The penultimate sentence of "The New Crisis of Xiaopinwen" is: "Authors and readers should influence each other, promote each other, so that the vast number of readers who have materials will also slowly learn to write." Obviously, after Xu Maoyong wantonly distorted and undermined the principles of criticism and self-criticism within the people, he further incited the readers here. He called on them to write Xiaopinwen like him, and smuggle in "a lot of materials" in Xiaopinwen, that is, what Xu Maoyong calls "knowledge that may not be known to everyone," to slander and attack our new society. How sinister is the intention of the rightist element Xu Maoyong!

### 徐懋庸煽动小品文作者反党

    徐懋庸煽动小品文作者反党
    山柏
    徐懋庸用回春的笔名所写的“小品文的新危机”（4月11日“人民日报”），不仅反对了我们党历来所主张的在人民内部进行整风的一些根本原则，而且向小品文作者进行了阴险的煽动。他用激将的办法，企图使他们一起利用小品文来反党反人民。
    这个右派分子耸人听闻地说，小品文面临着“消亡的危机”，原因是社会主义社会对小品文有许多“束缚”。对这些“束缚”，他一概反对，并且尽情地加以讥刺。
    小品文在作为人民内部批评的武器时，可能遭遇到官僚主义、教条主义、宗派主义的阻力。这是一种束缚，应该反对。但是小品文本身也可能有错误和缺点，或者事实不确，或者立场态度不对，或者动机不纯，或者批评的效果不利于社会主义，不利于人民，当这样的小品文遭到反批评时，就不能埋怨环境，而是要检查自己了。这是小品文本身的“束缚”，这种自我的“束缚”使小品文不能充分发挥它的力量，甚至造成不良后果。这能够把责任推到被批评者的方面去吗？难道应该有随意乱骂乱讽刺的“自由”，有不受正确的反批评的“自由”，有损害党和人民以及削弱社会主义的“自由”吗？如果徐懋庸所要求的“自由”和“民主”是这样的“自由”和“民主”，那么他是有理由说我们的社会是“不自由”“不民主”的。
    我们都知道，社会主义社会所实行的是社会主义民主，是有利于新社会的巩固和发展的民主制度，是民主集中制，而不是资产阶级的“民主”，或者小资产阶级的无政府主义的“民主”。抛开集中，只要“民主”，就不是我们人民所需要的民主；反对党的领导，只要个人“自由”，就不是我们人民所需要的自由。
    但是，徐懋庸所要求的恰恰就是这种带引号的“民主”和“自由”。他反对在批评人民内部的缺点时，必须站在人民的立场上、工人阶级的立场上，必须抱着治病救人的态度，必须遵循“团结——批评——团结”的方法。他反对这些，他嘲笑我们这样做是要求“中正和平”，要求“不生副作用”，这样做会使小品文失去“锋利的特点”。
    我们并不一般地反对“锋利”，人民内部的批评也可以锋利，也可以尖锐，但离开了立场和态度的问题，抽象地谈锋利和尖锐，是有害无益的。撇开阶级立场，不问对象是敌是友是我，笼统地要求锋利和尖锐，就会铸成敌我不分的大错，就会有站到敌人的立场上去的危险。
    社会主义民主是一种手段，是为了建设社会主义社会。因此，实行社会主义民主，进行人民内部的批评时，是应该考虑效果问题的。如果批评而有不利于社会主义的副作用的话，为什么不能要求避免这种副作用呢？要求避免损害人民和国家的利益，能说是一种“束缚”和“不自由”、“不民主”吗？
    拆穿了讲，徐懋庸所要求的无非是资产阶级的极端的个人自由。他反对要求小品文避免片面性；他反对小品文在发表前要经过报刊编辑部的研究；他反对小品文的文字通俗化，明朗化；他反对小品文只给小干部充当“盘尼西林”。相反地，他主张小品文只能“突出某一面”，不能力求全面；他把编辑部慎重处理稿件、在党的领导下进行编辑工作说成是：“一味小心”，“征求各色人等的意见”；他主张作者有权在小品文里“加一点未必是大家知道的知识”，以便含沙射影，进行人身攻击；他主张小品文的矛头指向领导干部，指向党。一句话，他主张小品文成为反党反人民的武器！
    徐懋庸的文章里偶然也出现“社会主义民主”字样，可是他实际上坚决地反对实行社会主义民主的一切具体的原则和方法，这算是拥护社会主义民主吗？这难道不是用社会主义民主做幌子，而实际反对它，企图用资产阶级民主来代替社会主义民主吗？
    “小品文的新危机”的末了第二句话是：“作者和读者要在相互影响之下，彼此促进，以致拥有材料的广大读者也慢慢地学会了写。”很明显，徐懋庸在肆意歪曲和破坏人民内部的批评和自我批评原则之后，在这里进一步地向读者进行了煽动，他号召他们要像他那样地写小品文，在小品文里偷运“大量材料”，即徐懋庸之所谓“未必是大家知道的知识”，来诽谤和攻击我们的新社会。右派分子徐懋庸的用心是多么险恶呀！
