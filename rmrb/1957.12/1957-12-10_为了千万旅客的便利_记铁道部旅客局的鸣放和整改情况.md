For the Convenience of Millions of Passengers
　　——A Record of the Blooming and Contending and Rectification of the Ministry of Railways Passenger Bureau
　　By our reporter Mu Yang
    “How is the rectification in railway transportation progressing? What improvements have been made in passenger service?” This is a question raised in a letter to the Ministry of Railways by someone who frequently travels by train on official business.
    In fact, how many people aren’t concerned about this issue? In 1956, there were 251 million train passengers; this year, it will certainly exceed 300 million. Hundreds of millions of passengers, and even more relatives and friends of passengers, aren’t they all, to varying degrees, concerned about this issue?
    In recent years, the development of railway passenger transport has basically met the needs of passengers. The number of passenger trips transported by railways nationwide this year will be nearly 3.5 times that of 1949. During this period, the speed of passenger trains on many lines has also been greatly increased. The service situation for passengers' travel lives is even more different than in the past. However, at the same time, these aspects also still have some problems that need to be improved.
      Where are the Problems?
    What are these problems? Just look at the opinions raised by the comrades of the Ministry of Railways Passenger Bureau during this blooming and contending.
    The first problem revealed by everyone is that, under the condition of large passenger flow, some passengers cannot buy tickets and board trains in a timely manner. This situation mostly occurs during holidays or when large-scale meetings are held.
    Can this situation be changed or at least improved by using existing conditions? After reading the following big-character posters, you will get the answer.
    At present, some passenger trains, such as the 65/66 passenger trains between Beijing and Baotou, sometimes only have eleven carriages attached when there are many passengers due to insufficient prior understanding of the situation, making it impossible for some passengers at intermediate stations to board the train in a timely manner. However, according to regulations and the actual traction capacity of the locomotive, this train can have thirteen carriages attached. This problem can obviously be solved "as long as the changes in passenger flow can be understood in advance." In addition, in order to meet passenger transport needs, the Ministry of Railways once converted some covered freight cars into simple passenger cars. In the past, some places used simple passenger cars because there were few cabooses (the rear car used by the conductor, which is very short) on freight trains, directly affecting passenger transport. This year, the Ministry of Railways explicitly prohibited this practice. However, after the Ministry order was issued, the Dispatching Section of the Transportation Bureau did not consult with the Passenger Bureau and approved the Beijing Railway Administration to continue using simple passenger car carriages. Official cars are exclusively for senior state cadres on official business. Hanging an official car on a passenger train means dropping a passenger car that can carry about a hundred people. Therefore, the State Council has promulgated relatively strict restrictions. However, the Ministry of Railways itself has not strictly implemented the regulations, and the scope of use of official cars is quite wide. This is both wasteful and affects passenger transport.
    The speed of passenger trains still has a lot of potential to be tapped. This is the second problem revealed by everyone. Some railway administrations, due to one-sided emphasis on the importance of freight transport, have affected the speed of passenger trains. Now, the 62nd passenger train from Guangzhou to Wuhan has to stop six times on the way, waiting for freight trains to arrive at the station or pass before it can continue. If these trains are not carrying very urgent materials, it is obviously abnormal to repeatedly stop thousands of passengers to wait for them to pass. Also, the most unsatisfactory thing is the temporary passenger trains added when passenger flow suddenly increases. In the past, the Transportation Bureau was afraid of disrupting the original operating schedule, so it usually allowed these types of passenger trains to run according to the operating schedule of freight trains, often excessively increasing passengers' travel time. This year, during the summer vacation, passengers on the 361st and 362nd temporary passenger trains from Beijing to Shanghai spent four days from boarding to getting off the train, which reduced the utilization rate of passenger trains and wasted passengers' time.
    The railway department has not been able to fully utilize existing conditions to give more care to passengers' travel lives. On this issue, everyone also has many opinions.
    "The dishes on the dining car are expensive and of poor quality," which is a common view of many people. Where is the problem? Originally, the prices of dishes on the dining car were calculated according to the prices at the train's originating station. The originating station is generally a large city with higher prices, while many non-staple foods used on the dining car, such as chicken, duck, fish, meat, and eggs, are bought from intermediate stations where prices are lower, which creates the problem of low cost and high selling price. Another reason for the high price of passenger dishes is the poor management system. Train crew members are uniformly charged two jiao per meal when they eat on the dining car. In principle, they should only eat food of equivalent price. However, now some dining car staff members are too lazy and give them more expensive passenger dishes, such as chicken, duck, fish, and meat. This inevitably affects the price and quality of passenger dishes and harms the interests of passengers.
    In addition, passengers will encounter more difficulties in the cold and windy winter in the north. Because the station buildings are not used as much as possible to serve passengers, passengers have to wait in the square outside the station, where they have to endure the cold. Some stations, such as Tai'an Station in Shandong, unilaterally emphasized saving coal, so they did not light the stoves in the waiting room last year even in very cold weather. This year, the Jinan Railway Administration once planned to save coal by reducing the temperature inside the car to below the standard temperature. Some passenger cars also cannot maintain sufficient temperature inside the carriage because they have single-layer windows; at the same time, a batch of new-type passenger cars that can emit their own heat are running on some lines in the south. This is the result of blindly allocating vehicles without considering specific conditions.
　  Find a Way to Solve it Immediately
    The comrades of the Passenger Bureau not only revealed these unreasonable phenomena on behalf of the vast number of passengers, but also enthusiastically put forward many feasible or referential improvement opinions. The rectification leading group of the Passenger Bureau is also working hard to improve in the spirit of rectifying and reforming simultaneously.
    Making it possible for as many passengers as possible to board the train in a timely manner under the condition of large passenger flow has become an important aspect of the rectification work of the Passenger Bureau. To this end, they are preparing to strengthen the work of understanding passenger flow in advance to eliminate the phenomenon that some trains still do not have enough carriages attached when there are many passengers. The problem of official cars affecting some passengers' ability to board the train in a timely manner has been strictly restricted by the Passenger Bureau with the help of the Ministry's Rectification Leading Group. The phenomenon of excessive use of official cars will not occur in the future.
    In order to shorten the time passengers spend bumping along the way, the comrades of the Passenger Bureau have also spent a lot of thought. A big-character poster posted by Comrade Zhao Quanming and others said that after test runs this winter, the Beijing Railway Administration can increase the train speed by an average of 2.1 kilometers per hour on the basis of the original speed. The line quality of this bureau is not much better than that of other bureaus. Therefore, Comrade Zhao Quanming and others believe that other bureaus should also organize test runs and find ways to improve. The rectification leading group of the Passenger Bureau accepted this suggestion and is now organizing forces to conduct test runs between Beijing and Shenyang and between Beijing and Shanghai. The original express train from Beijing to Shenyang took fourteen hours, but according to preliminary test run results, it is estimated that it may be shortened to twelve hours in the future. They are also studying solutions to other problems that affect the speed of passenger trains.
    In terms of caring for passengers' food and warmth, everyone has also put forward many improvement opinions from their own perspectives. On the one hand, they stopped some practices that harmed the interests of passengers, such as rejecting the Jinan Railway Administration's plan to reduce the temperature inside the car to save coal, and at the same time, they also dug up many plans that both meet the principle of diligence and thrift in building the country and meet the requirements of passengers. For example, in order to solve the problem of insufficient waiting rooms in many stations, Comrade Cai Shaoyuan consulted the data on the utilization of houses in railway stations across the country. The total area of station buildings in railway stations across the country is more than 592,000 square meters, and less than half of it is currently directly used to serve passengers. Many rooms are occupied by institutions that do not necessarily have to work in the station. These types of rooms can be completely adjusted to be waiting rooms. Whether it is inside the car or in the waiting room, as long as you think from a positive perspective, you can find ways to ensure passengers' warmth and save coal. Someone suggested at a symposium: In the northeast, some stations build fire walls between office rooms and waiting rooms, saving some stoves and ensuring a certain temperature. Someone suggested that the single-layer window carriages on the northern lines should be swapped with the new-type carriages on the southern lines. The leading group of the bureau is studying this suggestion.
    After repeated research by everyone, and with improvements already made, there are also another batch of problems related to passenger service. In the past, it was stipulated that children traveling for free should not occupy seats. This is impossible in practice and unnecessary, because very few passengers compete with children for seats. In the past, it was stipulated that passengers could carry two poultry with them. Although this facilitated a small number of passengers, it hindered the environmental sanitation of more passengers. Now, they have changed these regulations.
    In this way, as of November 30, the rectification leading group of the Passenger Bureau has processed more than 91% of the opinions put forward by everyone. In addition, they are preparing to organize debates on some issues that cannot be solved temporarily or by this unit alone, such as dining car food prices and passenger fares, in order to gather wisdom and seek reasonable solutions. Once these problems are also solved, the saying "It's good to be at home for a thousand days, but it's difficult to go out for a moment," which was widely circulated in the old society, will gradually be forgotten by railway passengers. By then, all train passengers will embark on their journeys more happily.

　　为了千万旅客的便利
　　——记铁道部旅客局的鸣放和整改情况
　　本报记者　穆扬
    “铁路运输方面的整改进行的怎样？对旅客服务方面，改进了些什么？”这是一位因公常乘火车的人，在写给铁道部的信中提出的问题。
    其实，关心这个问题的何止一个人？1956年，火车旅客有二亿五千一百万人次；今年肯定将超过三亿人次。亿万名乘客，还有为数更多的旅客的亲友，不是都或多或少地会关切这个问题吗？
    几年来，铁路客运事业的发展，基本上满足了旅客乘车的需要。今年全国铁路运送的旅客人次，将近1949年的三点五倍。在这个期间，许多线路的客车行驶速度，也大大地提高了。对于旅客的旅途生活服务情况，更是今非昔比。但是与此同时，也正是这几个方面，也都还存在一些问题，需要改进。
      问题在哪里？
    这是些什么问题呢？只要看一看铁道部旅客局的同志们在这次鸣放中提出的意见就够了。
    大家揭发出来的第一个问题，是在客流量较大的情况下，有一部分旅客不能及时买票乘车。这种情况多半发生在节日假期，或是召开大型会议的时候。
    利用现有条件，能不能改变或至少是改善这种情况呢？看过这样几张大字报，就会得到答案。
    目前，有的旅客列车，如北京——包头间的65、66次旅客列车，由于事先了解情况不够，有时在旅客很多的情况下，仍然只挂十一辆车厢，使中途站的一部分旅客，不能及时乘车。而这列客车，按规定和机车的实际牵引能力，是可以挂十三辆车厢的。这个问题，显然“只要能够事先了解客流的变化情况就可以得到解决。还有，铁道部为了满足客运需要，曾把一部分带棚货车改为简易客车。过去，有些地方因为货车的守车（车长公用的尾车，车厢很短）少，就拉用简易客车，直接影响客运。今年铁道部曾明令禁止这种作法。但是车务局调度科在部令下达后，没有同旅客局商量，批准北京铁路管理局继续拉用简易客车车厢。公务车，是专供国家高级干部出差公用的。旅客列车挂一辆公务车，就得甩掉一辆可乘百人左右的旅客车厢。因此，国务院曾颁布过比较严格的限制规定。但是，铁道部本身却没有严格执行规定，使用公务车的范围相当宽。既浪费，又影响了客运。
    旅客列车的行车速度，还有许多潜力没有发挥出来。这是大家揭露出来的第二个问题。有些铁路管理局，由于片面强调货物运输的重要性，影响了旅客列车的速度。现在从广州到武汉的第62次旅客列车，在途中就要停下六次，等待货车到站或通过后，才能继续前进。这些列车的物资，如果不是非常急要的，一定要千百名旅客一再地停下来，等它们通过，显然也是不正常的。还有，最不能使人满意的，是在客流量突然增多时增开的临时客车。过去，车务局怕打乱原有的运行计划，通常总是让这类客车按货车的运行时刻开行，往往会过多地增加旅客的旅行时间。今年暑期由北京开往上海的361次、362次临时客车，旅客们从上车到下车，前后就用了四天的时间，这样就降低了旅客列车的利用率，也浪费了旅客的时间。
    铁道部门还没能充分利用现有条件，对旅客的旅途生活给予更多的关怀。在这个问题上，大家的意见也不少。
    “餐车上的客菜，价高质差”，这是许多人的共同看法。问题在哪里呢？原来，餐车上的菜价，都是按照列车始发站的价格计算的。始发站一般是大城市，菜价较高，而餐车上用的许多副食品，如鸡、鸭、鱼、肉、蛋等，是从价格较低的中途站买的，这就产生了成本低，卖价高的问题。客菜贵的另一个原因，是管理制度不善。列车乘务人员在餐车用饭，统一规定每餐收费两角。按说，他们只应吃价格相当的饭菜。但是，现在有些餐车工作人员贪图省事，却给他们成本较高的客菜吃，如鸡、鸭、鱼、肉等。这必然影响客菜价格和质量，损害了旅客的利益。
    此外，北方的冬季天寒风冷，旅客们会遇到更多的困难。由于没有尽可能用车站房舍来为旅客服务，旅客们在站外广场上候车，就得挨冷受冻。有的车站，如山东泰安车站，为了片面地强调节约用煤，去年在很冷的天气还不生候车室的炉子。今年，济南铁路管理局还曾经打算以把车内温度降低到标准温度以下的办法，来节约煤炭。还有些客车，由于是单层车窗，车厢内不能保持足够的温度；而与此同时，在南方的一些线路上，却行驶着一批可以自己放送暖气的新型客车。这是没有考虑具体条件，盲目调拨车辆的结果。
　  找到办法立即解决
    旅客局的同志们不但设身处地代广大旅客揭发了这些不合理的现象，并且热情地提出了许多可行的、或是可供参考的改进意见。旅客局整风领导小组，也正本着边整边改的精神，努力改进着。
    在客流量较大的情况下，尽量使更多的旅客能够及时乘车，这已成为旅客局整改工作的一个重要方面。为此，他们正准备加强事先了解客流情况的工作，以消除在旅客较多的情况下，有些列车仍不挂足应挂车厢数的现象。影响一部分旅客及时乘车的公务车问题，旅客局在部整风领导小组帮助下，已经拟订了严格的限制条件。使用公务车过多的现象，今后就不会再发生了。
    为缩短旅客在旅途中的颠簸时间，旅客局的同志们也花费了不少思考。赵全铭等同志贴出的一张大字报说，北京铁路管理局今冬在试车后，行车时速在原有的基础上，可以平均提高二点一公里。这个局的线路质量，并不比其他局好得太多。因此，赵全铭等同志认为，其他局同样应该组织试车，设法改进。旅客局的整风领导小组接受了这个意见，现在正组织力量，在北京——沈阳间、北京——上海间进行试车。北京到沈阳，原来的快车需走十四小时，据初步试车结果，估计将来有可能缩短为十二小时。其他一些影响客车速度的问题，他们也正在研究解决办法。
    在体贴旅客的温饱方面，大家也都设身处地提出了许多改进意见。一方面，他们制止了一些损害旅客利益的作法，如否决了济南铁路管理局降低车内温度的节煤计划，同时还挖掘出许多既符合勤俭建国方针，又能满足旅客要求的方案。比如，为解决许多车站候车室不够用的问题，蔡绍源同志翻阅了全国各火车站房屋利用情况的资料。全国各火车站站房的总面积是五十九万二千多平方公尺，现在直接用来为旅客服务的，还不到二分之一。许多房舍都被一些不一定非在站内办公的机构占用了。这类房间，是完全可以调整作候车室的。不管是车内或是候车室，只要从积极方面着想，都可以找出既能保证旅客温暖，又能节约用煤的办法。有人在一次座谈会上提出：在东北地区，有些车站在办公用房和候车室之间生火墙，节约了一部分炉子，又能保证一定温度。有人建议，把北方线路上的单层车窗的车厢，同南方线路上的新型车厢对调一下。这项建议，局的领导小组正在研究中。
    经大家反复研究，并且已经作了改进的，还有有关旅客服务方面的另外一批问题。过去规定：免费乘车的儿童，不得占用席位。这在事实上是办不到的，也是不必要的。因为同儿童争座位的乘客毕竟极少。过去规定：旅客可以随身携带两只家禽。这虽然便利了一小部分旅客，却妨碍了更多旅客的环境卫生。现在，他们已经改变了这些规定。
    就这样，截止11月30日，旅客局整风领导小组对大家提出的意见，已经处理了91％以上。此外，有些一时或本单位不能单独解决的问题，如餐车菜价、旅客票价等，他们正准备组织辩论，以便集思广益，求得合理解决。一旦这些问题也得到解决，旧社会广泛流传的“在家千日好，出门一时难”这句谚语，就要渐渐地被铁路旅客们忘怀。到那时候，所有的火车乘客，都将更愉快地踏上旅途。
