Xinhua News Agency, Paris. The Franco-Chinese Friendship Association held its national congress at the Gujon Hall in Paris from December 1st to 3rd. The congress sent a telegram to the Chinese people congratulating China on its brilliant achievements and expressed its utmost efforts to urge the French government to recognize the People's Republic of China.

    The chairman of the association, Professor Jean Dresch of the University of Paris, gave a report on the work of the Franco-Chinese Friendship Association. Many delegates emphasized in discussing this report that France must recognize the People's Republic of China and that developing cultural and economic relations between the two countries is very important.

    Those who spoke at the conference included Senator Leo Hamon, General Paty, Madame Farge, and Ms. Langion, Assistant Director of the Cultural Relations Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

    At the end of the meeting, a new National Committee consisting of sixty-five members was formed, including Georges Auclair (writer, journalist), Jean Dresch, Vercors, Madame Farge, Madame Lucie Fauré, Mongeville, and Hamon.

    The congress, in the name of the Franco-Chinese Friendship Association, sent a telegram to the Chinese people expressing its brotherly friendship with the Chinese people and congratulating them on their achievements in construction.

    The telegram stated that the Franco-Chinese Friendship Association first hopes that the unhelpful silence that still separates France and China in terms of official relations can be eliminated, so that the two countries can hold fruitful talks. The Franco-Chinese Friendship Association is dealing with its national authorities to make its efforts more effective.

    The telegram said that the association firmly hopes that the days of restoring friendship will begin in the coming year, and the association will do its utmost to ensure that this moment arrives as soon as possible.

    In addition to representatives of local branches of the Franco-Chinese Friendship Association, the Anglo-Chinese Friendship Association, the Association for the Development of Italian-Chinese Relations, the Belgian-Chinese Association, and the Tunisian-Chinese Association also sent representatives to congratulate the congress.

    On November 30th, the congress screened Robert Menegoz's large-scale documentary about China at the Entrepot Hall.
