    Three Anhui Opera Troupes Go to the Countryside and Mines
    (Our News) Three state-owned opera troupes in Anhui Province are going to the countryside and mines to perform for workers and peasants. The first team of the Anhui Huangmei Opera Troupe went to Lujiang County in early December for a month of performances, dedicating most of its time to performing for workers and peasants in rural areas and mines. The main actors in this team include Yan Fengying, Zhang Yunfeng, Wang Shaomei, and Ding Yuquan. They brought with them excellent traditional repertoire beloved by the masses, such as "Road Encounter" and "Husband and Wife Watching Lanterns." The Anhui Luju Opera Troupe recently also sent out a performance team including Ding Yulan, Sun Bangdong, and Bao Zhiyuan, carrying excellent repertoire such as "Divorcing Dingxiang" and "Bai Yu Lou," to perform for peasants and cadres participating in agricultural production at the Jiashan Pinghu Farm. After performing at the Huainan Coal Mine, the Anhui Drama Troupe recently went to the Xianghongdian Reservoir to perform for workers, while also performing for nearby peasants. They brought with them the lyrical comedy "The Cuckoo is Calling Again" and three one-act plays about the anti-Rightist struggle: "Alien," "Headless Fly," and "Dark Clouds Cannot Block the Sun."
    Many actors participating in the tour expressed that they would overcome all difficulties to complete the performance tasks; during the performances, they would actively participate in agricultural production, learn from workers and peasants, transform their own thoughts and feelings, and strive to train themselves to become literary and art workers of the working class.
