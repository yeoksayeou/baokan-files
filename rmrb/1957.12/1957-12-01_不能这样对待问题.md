The masses of the Hubei Provincial Highway Bureau revealed the following fact during the venting of opinions: The State Council stipulates that overtime work on statutory holidays should be paid extra wages. The personnel of the Security Section of the Highway Bureau worked as usual during holidays without receiving wages. The Finance Section asked Director He how to solve the problem. Director He actually made the following instruction: "This problem is difficult to solve, it is best not to solve it."

Not to mention that this problem is not difficult at all, because there are clear regulations from the State Council that can be followed. Even if it is really "difficult," one should not bow down in the face of difficulties, but should show revolutionary spirit to solve the problem. As a leader, how can Director He use the method of "it is best not to solve it" to solve this problem?

　　不能这样对待问题
    湖北省公路厅群众在鸣放中，揭露了这样一个事实：国务院规定法定假日加班应该加发工资。公路厅保卫科人员在例假日照常工作未领工资，财务科请示何厅长如何解决，何厅长竟作了这样的批示：“此问题难得解决，最好不解决为妥”。
    且不说这个问题根本不难，因为已有国务院明文规定，照办即可。就是真“难”的话，也不能在困难面前低头，而应该拿出革命精神来解决问题。何厅长作为一个领导者，怎么能用“最好不解决为妥”的办法来解决这个问题呢？
