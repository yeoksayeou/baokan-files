From the countryside poetry

    Water is coming!
    A cheer,
    The stream flows into the ditch heading towards the fields,
    The crowd resounds with earth-shattering gongs and drums!
    Those who can sing begin to sing high-pitched songs;
    Those who can dance begin to dance joyful dances.
    Men, women, old, young,
    Feet jumping non-stop, hearts beating non-stop!
    A child scoops up a ladle of clear water,
    Like a scattering of pearls in the sunlight,
    Who doesn't want to taste this sweet water!
    So much happiness is blended within.

    水来了
  　崔鹏
    水来了！
    一声欢呼，
    溪水流进奔向田野的水沟，
    人群里响起了震天的锣鼓！
    会唱的唱起了高亢的歌；
    会跳的跳起了欢乐的舞。
    男的，女的，老的，少的，
    脚跳个不住，心跳个不住！
    孩子扬起一瓢清水，
    阳光里像飞起一片珍珠，
    谁不想尝尝这甜甜的水呵！
    在里面融合着多少幸福。
