    The first group of 163 people from Shanghai First Medical College who participated in agricultural physical labor have arrived at agricultural cooperatives in the eastern suburbs of Shanghai, preparing to engage in physical labor for more than half a year. The majority of those going to the countryside this time are graduates of this year, as well as lecturers, teaching assistants, technicians, nurses, and administrative staff who have worked for many years. Chen Gongjie, who studied ophthalmology, had people looking for her to treat their eyes as soon as she arrived in the countryside.

    上海第一医学院第一批参加农业体力劳动的一百六十三人，已到上海东郊的农业社，准备从事半年以上的体力劳动。这次下乡绝大部分是本届毕业生，还有工作多年的讲师、助教、技术员、护士和行政人员。陈公洁是学眼科的，她刚到农村就有人找她看眼。
