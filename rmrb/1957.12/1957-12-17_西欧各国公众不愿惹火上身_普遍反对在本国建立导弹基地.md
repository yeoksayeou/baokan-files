Xinhua News Agency dispatches: "The interest of people on the European continent in the issue of setting up nuclear missile bases on their territory is about the same as a homeowner's interest in the government setting up an ammunition depot in their basement." This is a witty remark from a recent London dispatch published by the "Washington Post". The author of the dispatch pointed out that conversations with officials and ordinary people in some countries on the European continent revealed that people are not enthusiastic about the American nuclear missile base plan. The dispatch also stated that due to the emergence of long-range missiles, more and more people believe that the European continent may be able to avoid being drawn into war. Therefore, many ordinary citizens ask: "Why set up missile bases here and invite retaliation?"

Recent developments have confirmed the statement in this dispatch. With the convening of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit, the movement of the public in Western European countries against the establishment of American missile bases and the storage of nuclear weapons in their countries is continuing to expand.

A group of French parliamentarians and writers issued an appeal on the 14th, calling on French people to write to their representatives, requesting the National Assembly to debate the issue of setting up missile launch pads and atomic bombs in France, and asking the parliamentarians to propose proposals that could ease international tensions.

French newspapers continue to express concern about the American plan to force the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to accept the establishment of missile launch bases on their territory. The influential "Le Monde" said, "France hopes that the use of rocket weapons will not depend solely on the decisions of the American military command." "France-Soir" said that a very important issue for the French government is: "Who will hold the power to 'press the button' to launch rockets."

The West German public is increasingly expressing opposition to the deployment of atomic and rocket weapons in West Germany. According to the results of a survey of 100,000 people conducted by the "Emnid" public opinion research institute published by the West German "Die Welt" on the 14th, 73% of the people oppose equipping the West German army with atomic weapons, and 74% oppose the establishment of rocket bases in West Germany.

Leaders of the West German Free Democratic Party wrote to West German Chancellor Adenauer and President Heuss, advocating the establishment of a zone without atomic weapons in Central Europe and the phased withdrawal of foreign troops from German territory.

Norway's "Dagbladet" published an editorial opposing the American plan to deploy rockets and atomic weapons on Norwegian territory. The newspaper said that the majority of the Norwegian people demand that the Norwegian government not change its policy on the issue of bases. The Norwegian people are unwilling to be at the forefront of the battle line and are unwilling to become the main target of atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and super rockets.

### 西欧各国公众不愿惹火上身  普遍反对在本国建立导弹基地

    西欧各国公众不愿惹火上身
    普遍反对在本国建立导弹基地
    本报综合报道  据新华社讯：“西欧大陆上的人对于在他们的国土上设置核导弹基地这个问题的兴趣，就跟一个房主对于政府要在他的地下室里设置一个弹药库的兴趣差不多。”这是“华盛顿邮报”最近刊载的一篇伦敦通讯的警句。通讯的作者指出，他在西欧大陆上一些国家里同官员和老百姓谈话的结果证明，人们对美国的核导弹基地计划并不热心。通讯又说，由于远程导弹的出现，有愈来愈多的人认为西欧大陆有可能避免卷入战争。因此许多普通公民问道：“为什么要在这里设置导弹基地而招致反击呢？”
    最近的事态证实了这篇通讯的说法。随着北大西洋集团首脑会议的召开，西欧各国公众反对在本国建立美国导弹基地和储存核武器的运动正在继续扩展中。
    法国一批议员和作家14日发表呼吁书，呼吁法国人写信给议员，要求国民议会辩论在法国设置导弹发射台和原子弹的问题，并且要求议员们提出可以使国际紧张局势趋向缓和的提案。
    法国报纸对于美国打算强迫北大西洋集团各成员国接受在它们领土上建立导弹发射基地的计划继续表示不安。有影响的“世界报”说，“法国希望，火箭武器的使用不要仅只取决于美国军事指挥部的决定”。“法兰西晚报”说，对法国政府来说，一个非常重要的问题是：发射火箭的“按电钮的权力将操在谁的手里”。西德公众越来越广泛地表示反对在西德安置原子武器和火箭武器。据西德“世界报”14日发表的“艾姆尼德”民意调查所对十万人进行调查的结果，73％的人反对西德军队装备原子武器，74％的人反对在西德建立火箭基地。
    西德自由民主党领导人写信给西德总理阿登纳和总统豪斯，主张在中欧建立不设置原子武器的地带，并且分阶段撤退在德国境内的外国军队。
    挪威的“日报”发表社论，反对美国在挪威领土上配置火箭和原子武器的计划。报纸说，大多数挪威人民要求挪威政府不改变关于基地问题的政策。挪威人民不愿意处在战线的前沿，不愿成为原子弹、氢弹和超级火箭的主要目标。
