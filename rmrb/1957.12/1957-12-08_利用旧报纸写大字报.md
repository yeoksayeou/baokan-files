　　Using Old Newspapers to Write Big-Character Posters
　　To the Editorial Staff:
　　Recently, big-character posters have been plastered everywhere in organizations, factories, schools, and rural areas across the country. Big-character posters have become one of the most powerful forms of "blooming" and "contending." According to statistics, each unit (regardless of size) now posts thousands or hundreds of big-character posters, and after a few days, they are torn down and replaced with new ones. If we calculate this on a national scale, this kind of consumption is astonishing. In order to streamline and save resources, I suggest that all units writing big-character posters should try to use old paper (such as newspapers) and low-grade paper (such as oiled paper), and use less or no high-grade paper (such as kraft paper, fancy paper). In addition, each unit can prepare more blackboards as venues for airing opinions.

### 利用旧报纸写大字报

　  利用旧报纸写大字报编辑同志：
    最近一个时期，全国各地的机关、工厂、学校、农村，到处都贴满了大字报，大字报已成了“鸣”、“放”的最有力的一种形式。据统计，现在各单位（不论大小）贴出的大字报动辄数千、百张，而且，过不几天，又撕去，重贴上新的。如以全国来统计，这种消耗是很惊人的。为了精简节约，我建议各单位写大字报，应该尽量利用旧纸张（如报纸）和低级纸张（如油光纸），少用或不用高级纸张（如牛皮纸、刊花纸）。另外各单位可以多制备一些黑板，作为鸣放园地。
