　　Culture Enters the Mountainous Areas
　　——A Record of Literacy Work in Yao County
　　Hu Yutian
    Yao County in Shaanxi Province is a mountainous area. In the past, 90% of the farmers here were illiterate. In recent years, literacy work here has developed rapidly. In sixty-five villages across the county, young people can now recognize between 1,500 and 3,000 characters, and these villages have essentially become youth-illiteracy-free villages.

　　Culture is a Key to Open Doors
    Literacy work in Yao County began in the winter of 1951. Over the years, fifty-six folk schools throughout the county have persisted in year-round study. However, literacy was still not widespread. During the high tide of agricultural cooperativization in 1955, many villages met the conditions for establishing cooperatives, but they were delayed in doing so because they could not find accountants. At this time, the county party committee called on all cadres in the county to take up literacy work and put forward the slogan: "Everyone should grasp literacy, everyone should learn culture, and turn poor mountains into rich mountains; culture is the key to open doors." That winter, the county mobilized more than 1,500 primary school teachers and middle and primary school students to carry out a large-scale cultural propaganda movement during the winter vacation, in coordination with government cadres. The county established eight large literacy propaganda teams, each with sub-teams, and each sub-team with groups, with each team dividing up areas and assigning responsibilities. In addition to propaganda through blackboards, loudspeakers, and reading groups, youth meetings, women's meetings, and old people's forums were held to widely publicize the benefits of learning culture. Leaders at the county, district, and township levels also gave reports to everyone. After such mobilization, the masses generally understood the importance of learning culture.

    A great upsurge in learning culture was set off, with more than 34,000 young and middle-aged illiterate and semi-illiterate people in the county enrolling in school, accounting for more than 90% of the enrollment. In order to consolidate and develop the work, twenty-one townships across the county established literacy associations, and agricultural cooperatives established branches and 167 youth literacy classes, with a total of 7,000 people participating. At the same time, more than 800 backbone folk school teachers were trained centrally at the county level. County leaders also stipulated that whichever place a cadre went to, they would serve as the political instructor of the folk school in that place, teaching political classes to the students on schedule; every cadre should report on the literacy work in their area after returning from working in the countryside. The deputy county head and the head of the Culture and Education Section also personally went to villages such as Zhangjiabao to give political classes to the folk school students. Because this series of work was done well, in the past two years, 85% of the 487 year-round folk schools in the county have been able to persist in year-round study.

    Learning Doesn't Stop, Spring, Summer, Autumn or Winter
    Farmers in Yao County learn culture regardless of the seasons. Whether it is the depths of winter or the heat of summer, no matter how busy they are with work, it has not stopped the enthusiasm of the farmers to learn. The forms of their learning are also diverse, including field literacy groups, alleyway literacy boards, delivering literacy to the door, passing on literacy, kang-head groups, and family literacy boards. In terms of teaching, there is mobile teaching and cultural support, etc. In terms of guaranteeing teaching and learning, slogans such as "Relatives teach relatives, neighbors teach neighbors, and close friends teach close friends" are put forward. The learning method is to learn what you do, and do what you learn. The students also hold the attitude of "learn a word, grow a wisdom," and their learning enthusiasm is very high. Hou Fulin, a student at the Fujia Yuan village folk school, studies very hard, and for more than two years, he has practiced writing every night. In half a year, he finished more than 30 thick notebooks. Now, he can write fluent small regular script and large characters, and can also write very coherent articles. He also frequently contributes to newspapers. A middle-aged couple in Lishuwan Village, Zhaojin District, were initially unable to remember things in class and were very worried. The two came up with ways to supervise each other and memorize things by division of labor, overcoming the difficulties in learning. Many students learn regardless of time, place, day, or night. In the literacy movement, many office cadres, teachers, and students have automatically come to support it greatly. For example, the 42 senior Young Pioneers of Zhaojin Township Elementary School, in addition to teaching their parents, brothers, and sisters, also used half an hour every day to teach 48 people on the street. Team member Zhang Aimin taught one person to recognize 124 characters in one month. The teachers and students of the Liulin District Complete Primary School also organized a "Teaching Team," carrying large blackboards while helping farmers with field production, teaching the members to read. As a result, many farmers were able to recognize many characters even during the busy farming season.

    More than 500 role models in running schools, teaching, and learning have emerged in the folk schools. Among these many people, there are elderly, young, male, and female. Sun Bingjun, a teacher at the Qiancao Village Folk School, is responsible for literacy work in seventeen villages of all sizes within a radius of twenty li. Despite the long distance, high mountains, and the dispersed locations of the students, he carried a large blackboard every other day, regardless of the weather, to teach everywhere. He persisted in this for four years, turning a completely illiterate village into a cultural village. Pei Chaoxing, a teacher in Nansima Village, Yaoqu Township, saw that Xiangshulin Village had no cultural teacher, so he took a few cold buns every day after finishing work in the field and went to teach for an hour before returning to teach his own villagers' folk school class. Yin Jishan, from Baijiazhuang, Shigou Township, in order to support the farmers of Baishupo Village in learning culture, crossed the mountains every night and rushed back the next morning until he had personally trained a teacher. These many people who resolutely marched toward culture added great confidence and strength to the masses in learning culture.

    Every Household Has Cultured People
    After seven years of continuous study, a new scene has emerged in the countryside of Yao County. Now, more than 1,800 agricultural cooperative directors, captains, accountants, technicians, literacy teachers, newspaper readers, and librarians and club managers in the county are all graduates of folk schools. At present, each township has a cultural station, each agricultural cooperative has a library and reading room, and each library has three or four hundred books and picture story books. Each production team also has three or four local newspapers and magazines. The county also has more than thirty mobile book bags, bringing many new books to farmers in various places every month. More than 3,000 blackboards and many mimeographed small bulletins are updated with new content on schedule along with the production movement. Sixty-seven farmer amateur theatrical troupes perform everywhere in coordination with various movements. The seven amateur theatrical troupes in Shigou Township have people who can compose clapper ballads, tell stories, and perform operas. They can sing independently during festivals or at large meetings, temple fairs, and gatherings. During the major production campaign this spring, they performed self-written plays such as "Learning Culture" and "Couples Learning Literacy." When publicizing the "unified purchase and sale" policy, their performances of plays such as "Grain" were praised by the masses everywhere. During the Spring Festival last year, the folk school students of Xipo Village organized a 50-member folk school student singing team, and when they arrived in Yao County City, no less than 10,000 people watched.

    People have more culture, know more principles, and have broader knowledge, so new technologies can be spread quickly. Zhangdu Agricultural Cooperative in Shigou Township used to have very few literate people, and no one knew how to use new agricultural implements. Now, twenty-one people in the cooperative have become experts in mastering double-wheeled double-furrow plows. The members of the Xiaoyi Agricultural Cooperative could not accept new agricultural technologies in the past, but after learning culture, they bought a new book, "Qu Yaoli's Cotton Planting Experience," this year. The members mixed the seeds, kept seedlings, and pruned the branches according to the methods in the book, resulting in more than 100 mu of cotton exceeding the highest yield in previous years. The members of the Yaoguang Agricultural Cooperative saw Wang Baojing's corn high-yield experience in the newspaper, carefully studied the characteristics of the local soil and climate, and conducted experiments. As a result, each mu yielded 1,300 jin, more than 50% higher than in previous years.

    In recent years, walking through the fields of Yao County, you can see literacy boards everywhere. In every family, you can see literacy boards. At the entrance of the village, at the crossroads, on big trees, on gates, and in toilets, there are new character boards everywhere, waiting for you to learn. Every day after dinner, when you stand on any high ridge and look around, you can see strings of lanterns and torches wriggling all over the mountains and fields, as the members sing various songs and go to folk schools to learn. Now, Yao County is truly "every family has college students, and every household has cultured people." Culture has greatly changed the face of the mountainous area here, and culture has brought untold benefits to the farmers. People are no longer blind men. In the Yao County literacy plan, it is also planned that by the end of May 1959, all young and middle-aged farmers in the county will basically get rid of illiteracy. At that time, it can become a cultural county.

　　文化进入了山区
　　——记耀县的扫盲工作
　　胡玉田
    陕西省耀县是个山区，过去这里90％的农民都是文盲。近几年来，这里的扫盲工作飞快发展，全县已经有六十五个村的青年，都认识一千五百字到三千字，这些村庄基本变成青年无盲村了。
　　文化是敲门砖
    耀县的扫盲工作，是从1951年冬天开始的。几年来，全县有五十六个民校，坚持了常年学习。可是，识字的人还不普遍。1955年农业合作化高潮的时候，许多村庄建社的条件都具备了，但因为找不到会计，迟迟不能建社。这时县委就号召全县干部都抓起扫盲工作来，并提出这样的口号：“人人抓扫盲，个个学文化，要把穷山变富山，文化便是敲门砖。”这年冬天，全县动员了一千五百多名小学教师和中小学学生，利用寒假期间，配合政府干部，展开了一次规模很大的文化宣传大运动。全县成立了八个扫盲宣传大队，每个大队下面设分队，分队下面设组，各队划片包干，每人分工负责。除通过黑板报、传话筒、读报组进行宣传以外，还召开了青年会、妇女会、老人座谈会，普遍宣传学文化的好处。县、区、乡各级领导干部还分别向大家作了报告。经过这样动员以后，群众普遍都知道了学文化的重要意义。
    学文化的大高潮掀起来了，全县有三万四千多个青、壮年文盲、半文盲报名入学，占入学人数的90％以上。为了做好巩固和发展工作，全县二十一个乡，都成立了扫盲协会，又在各农业社成立了分会和一百六十七个青年扫盲班，共吸收了七千人参加，同时在县上集中训练 了八百多名骨干民校教师。县领导并规定全县干部，谁到哪个地方，谁就担任哪个地方民校的政治教员，按期给学员教政治课；每个干部下乡工作归来，都要汇报自己所在地区的扫盲工作情况。副县长和文教科科长，也都亲自到张家堡等村，给民校学员讲政治课。因为这一系列的工作做得好，近两年来，全县四百八十七个常年民校，85％都能坚持常年学习。
    学习不分春夏秋冬
    耀县农民学文化，是不分春夏秋冬的。不管是数九寒天，不论是炎热的夏天，不管工作再忙，都没有阻挡住农民们学习的热情。他们学习的形式，也是多种多样的，有地头识字组，巷道识字牌，送字上门，传递识字，炕头组，家庭识字板等。在教学方面，有巡回教学，文化支援等等。在包教保学方面，提出：“亲教亲，邻教邻，知心人教的知心人”等口号。学习方法是，做啥学啥，学啥做啥。学员也都抱着“学一字，长一智”的态度，学习情绪很高。符家塬村民校学员侯福林，学习十 分努力，二年多来，每晚练习写字。半年内就写完了三十多个很厚的笔记本子。现在，他已能写得一手流利的小楷和大字，也能写很通顺的文章了。他还经常给报社投稿。照金区梨树湾村一对壮年夫妇，起初上课记不住，很发愁，俩人便想出互相监督，分工死记等办法，克服了学习上的困难。许多学员都是不分时间、地点，不分白天、黑夜地学习。在扫盲运动中，许多机关干部和教师、学生，都自动大力来支援，如照金乡小学的四十二个高年级少先队员，除包教自己的父母兄弟姐妹外，每天还利用半个小时的功夫，在街上包教了四十八个群众。队员张爱民在一月内，就包教一个人识到一百二十四个字。柳林区完小师生，还组织了一个“包教大队”，在农民们田间生产的时候，提着大黑板，一面帮助生产，一面教社员识字。这样做的结果，使很多农民在农忙的时候，也能识到许多字。
    在民校里，出现了五百多个办学模范、教学模范、和学习模范人物。这许多人物中，有老年、有青年、有男有女。前槽村民校教师孙炳俊，他负责方圆二十里路内的十七个大小村庄扫盲工作。在路远、山高，学员住的又分散的情况下，他隔天背上大黑板，不管天热天冷，不管刮风下雪，到各处去教学，这样坚持了四年，一直把一个完全文盲村，变成了文化村。瑶曲乡南司马村教师裴朝兴，看到相书林村没有文化教师，他每天从地里收工回来，就揣上几个冷馍，自动去教学一点钟，然后再回来给本村民校上课。寺沟乡白家庄阴吉善，为支援柏树坡村农民学文化，每天晚上翻过山去，第二天麻麻亮赶回来，一直到亲手培养出教师为止。这许多坚决为文化进军的人们，给群众学习文化增添了很大的信心和力量。
    户户都有文化人
    经过七年来的不断学习，耀县的农村里，出现了一片新的景象。现在全县的一千八百多名农业社主任、队长、会计、技术员、扫盲教师、读报员、图书和俱乐部管理员，都是民校毕业的学员。目前各乡都有了文化站，各农业社都有了图书阅览室，每个图书室，都有图书、连环画三、四百本。每个生产队，也都有当地三、四种报刊。全县还有三十多个流动图书包，每月给各地农民带来很多新书。三千多张黑板报和许多油印小快报，随着生产运动，按期更换着新的内容。六十七个农民业余剧团，配合各种运动，到处演出。寺沟乡的七个业余剧团，里边有人能编快板，能说书，能演戏，每到年节或是逢到开大会、庙会、集会的时候，都能单独演唱。今春生产大突击的时候，他们演出自己编写的“学文化”、“夫妻识字”等戏。在宣传“统购统销”政策的时候，他们演出的“粮食”等戏，到处受到群众的称赞。去年春节的时候，西坡村民校学员，组织了五十个民校学员歌唱队，到耀县城里时，观看的人不下一万多。
    人们有了文化，道理知道的多，见识也广了，新的技术也就能很快地传播开来。寺沟乡张都农业社，原来识字的人很少，新农具来了没人会用，而现在全社有二十一人，都成了掌握双轮双铧犁的能手。孝义农业社的社员们，过去接受不了新农业技术，学了文化后，今年却买来了“曲耀离种棉经验”新书。社员们按照书本上的办法拌种、留苗、整枝，结果一百多亩棉花，超出历年来的最高产量。耀光农业社的社员们在报上看到了王保京的玉米丰产经验，仔细研究了当地土壤、气候的特点，进行了试验，结果每亩产一千三百斤，高出往年50％多。
    这几年来，走过耀县的田野，到处可以看到地头识字牌。在每个家庭，都看到识字板。村口、十字街口、大树上、门楼上、厕所里，随处都有生字板，等你学习。每天吃过晚饭的时候，当你站在随便一个高坎上四望，只见一溜带串的灯笼、火把，在满山遍野蠕动，社员们唱着哼着各种歌曲，去民校学习。现在，耀县真是“家家都有大学生，户户都有文化人”。文化已大大改变着这里山区的面貌，文化给农民们带来了说不尽的好处，人们再也不当睁眼瞎了。在耀县扫盲规划中还打算在1959年5月底，使全县所有青壮年农民，都基本摆脱文盲状态。那时候，就可以变成一个文化县了。
