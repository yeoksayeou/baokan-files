　　Places Where Every Township Has a Telephone

　　Apart from the islands scattered along the coast, every township in the rural areas of Dalian suburbs, Jin County, and Lushun in Lüda City now has one to several telephones. Many agricultural cooperatives also have telephones in their offices for direct communication with the city. Wired broadcasting networks have been gradually established in the rural areas of Jin County and Lushun, with almost every agricultural and fishing cooperative having loudspeakers. Some agricultural cooperatives have even installed loudspeakers in the homes of their members. The rural areas in this region also possess over 14,000 radio receivers, averaging one receiver for every 35 people.

　　The Dalian Marine Meteorological Observatory forecasts weather changes via telephone and broadcast, enabling farmers and fishermen to prepare for cold, wind, or rain early on. After installing sixty large broadcasting loudspeakers in the coastal fishing villages of Lushun, messages are immediately broadcast loudly in the event of strong winds or heavy rain, recalling fishing boats operating at sea.

　  乡乡有电话的地方
    旅大市除了散布在沿海的岛屿外，现在大连郊区、金县、旅顺等地农村，每个乡都已经装上一台到几台电话。许多农业社的办公室也有电话直接同城市通话。金县、旅顺农村有线广播网已逐步建立起来，差不多每个农业社、渔业社都有喇叭筒。有些农业社在社员家里都装上一个喇叭筒。这一带农村还拥有一万四千多架无线电收音机。平均三十五人中就有一架收音机。
    大连海洋气象台通过电话和广播预告天气变化情况，使农民和渔民能够及早作好防寒、防风或是防雨等准备工作。在旅顺沿海渔村安装了六十个广播大喇叭筒后，遇到大风大雨时，便立刻大声广播消息，招回在海面上捕鱼的渔船。
