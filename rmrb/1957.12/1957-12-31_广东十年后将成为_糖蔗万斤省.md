Guangdong to Become a "10,000-Jin Sugar Cane Province" in Ten Years

    (Our dispatch) Guangdong Province has decided to do everything possible to strive to increase the average sugar cane yield per mu in the province from 5,500 jin in 1956 to 10,000 jin in ten years, and the total output from 7.96 billion jin to 50 billion jin, transforming it into a "10,000-jin sugar cane province."

    According to the analysis of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the potential for sugar cane production in Guangdong Province is still very large, and it is entirely possible to achieve a "10,000-jin sugar cane province." Before liberation, in 1949, the yield per mu of sugar cane in the province was only 3,000 jin, but this year it has reached 6,000 jin, an increase of more than double. In the next ten years, as long as it increases by 400 jin each year, it can reach 10,000 jin. Now, Chao'an and Chenghai have already emerged as two "10,000-jin sugar cane counties" and hundreds of "10,000-jin sugar cane cooperatives" in the province. Dongchong Cooperative in Dongguan County has also created high-yield records of 12,000 jin to 25,000 jin over large areas.

    In order to achieve this goal, Guangdong Province plans to develop sugar cane production by increasing the yield per unit area and expanding the planting area through land reclamation, gradually turning low-yield fields with the greatest potential for increasing production into high-yield fields; opening up fertilizer sources to ensure the application of 3,000 to 5,000 jin of organic fertilizer per mu; striving to basically popularize superior cane varieties such as "Taiwan Sugar 134" and "India 419" before 1962, and comprehensively implement various measures to increase production. In the future, in addition to continuing to consolidate and improve the production of the existing old sugar cane areas such as the Pearl River Delta and the Chaoshan Plain, the province has decided to establish new sugar cane producing areas in Zhanjiang and Hepu Special Districts and Hainan Island, which have subtropical conditions.

    Now, farmers in various sugar cane producing areas throughout the province are actively carrying out preparatory work for cultivation. The provincial agricultural department has sent sugar cane experts and senior technical cadres to the new producing areas for surveying, and the Provincial People's Committee has also decided to issue sugar cane production loans of 7.5 million yuan this winter and next spring to help farmers purchase land reclamation tools, seedlings, and other expenses.

### 广东十年后将成为“糖蔗万斤省”

    广东十年后将成为“糖蔗万斤省”
    本报讯　广东省决定想尽一切办法，争取在十年后全省糖蔗平均亩产由1956年的五千五百斤达到一万斤，总产量由七十九亿六千万斤达到五百亿斤，变成“糖蔗万斤省”。
    根据中共广东省委的分析，广东省糖蔗生产潜力还很大，实现“糖蔗万斤省”是完全可能的。在解放前1949年全省糖蔗的亩产只有三千斤，但到今年已达到六千斤，增长了一倍以上。今后十年只要每年递增四百斤就可以达到一万斤。现在全省已经出现了潮安、澄海两个“糖蔗万斤县”和数百个“糖蔗万斤社”。东莞县东冲社也创造了大面积的一万二千斤至二万五千斤的丰产纪录。
    为了实现这个目标，广东省准备从提高单位面积产量和开荒扩大种植面积来发展糖蔗生产，把增产潜力最大的低产田逐步变成高产田；开辟肥源，保证每亩施有机肥料三千至五千斤；争取在1962年以前基本上普及“台糖134号”、“印度419号”等优良蔗种，和全面贯彻各种增产措施。今后全省除了继续巩固和提高现有的珠江三角洲、潮汕平原等糖蔗老区的生产以外，决定在具有亚热带条件的湛江、合浦专区和海南岛建立新的糖蔗产区。
    现在全省各个糖蔗产区的农民已积极进行备耕工作，省农业部门已派出糖蔗专家和高级技术干部到新的产区进行勘查，省人民委员会也决定在今冬明春发放糖蔗生产贷款七百五十万元帮助农民购买开荒工具、种苗等费用。
