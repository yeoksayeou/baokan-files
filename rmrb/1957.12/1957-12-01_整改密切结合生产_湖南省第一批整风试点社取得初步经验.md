Rectification Closely Integrated with Production
    Initial Experiences Gained by the First Batch of Rectification Pilot Communes in Hunan Province

    (Our report) The first batch of eight hundred rectification pilot communes in Hunan Province has now largely entered the rectification phase. Because these communes paid attention to rectification and reform while simultaneously conducting the great airing of views, great blooming of contending thoughts, and great debates, they closely integrated production and rectification work. Rectification has promoted current production and encouraged the airing of views and debates.

    The experience of the pilot communes demonstrates that emphasizing rectification during the rectification movement can achieve the goals of improving work and promptly promoting production, without causing the rectification movement to become detached from production. The Qingshan Agricultural Cooperative in Hongshi Township, Shaoyang County, originally had very poor labor management. Some production team leaders were irresponsible, cooperative members could not find work, and few women participated in labor. After the rectification began, cooperative members raised many opinions in this regard. The cooperative committee immediately studied and improved labor management. In addition to educating the production team leaders to conscientiously assume their responsibilities, it also implemented a "three-guarantee" system for winter planting based on the current production situation, and made specific arrangements for women's participation in labor. In addition, it also promptly addressed issues such as the unreasonable allocation of work points for cattle herding and the failure to distribute pig feed to households. This closely integrated rectification and production.

    The experience of the pilot communes also demonstrates that emphasizing rectification during the rectification movement can make the masses more willing to offer opinions, speak their minds freely, and actively participate in debates. At the beginning of the airing of views in the Zhongchangchongpu Cooperative in Xinshao County, some cooperative members, while offering opinions, were also observing whether the leadership had the sincerity and determination to improve their work. After learning about this situation, the work team cadres and cooperative leaders decided to immediately improve the work that could be improved at that time. As a result, the relationship between the Party and the masses and between cadres and the masses was further improved, and the cooperative members were more willing to offer opinions. Some people raised that the division of production teams and farming areas was unreasonable. The cooperative quickly studied and dealt with such matters. During the airing of views, the cooperative handled fourteen major issues and fifty local issues. It was precisely because of this that a climax of great airing of views and great blooming of contending thoughts was formed in the cooperative.

    Some cooperatives have summarized a lot of experience in rectifying and improving simultaneously. The cadres of the Cishan Agricultural Cooperative in Hengnan saw that the masses had put forward many opinions, and it was indeed difficult to improve them all at the same time. Therefore, during the airing of views, the cooperative chose to improve the things that were of great importance to the current production or rectification first, and explained to the masses that the others would be improved later. At the same time, improving work was not a simple matter. Some things could not be solved by a few people talking about them. The cooperative also paid attention to the mass line, letting everyone offer ideas and find solutions, and put forward constructive suggestions for improving work. No matter how the work was improved, attention was paid to doing things according to the policies, avoiding the tendency of correcting the bias in one area while another bias appeared. Therefore, the improved work has been supported by the masses.

　　整改密切结合生产
    湖南省第一批整风试点社取得初步经验
    本报讯　湖南省第一批八百个整风试点社，现在大部分已进入整社阶段。这些社由于在大鸣大放大争的同时，注意了进行整改，因而使生产和整风工作密切地配合起来，整风推动了当前的生产，鼓舞了鸣放和辩论。
    试点社的经验证明，在整风中重视整改，就可以达到改进工作，及时推动生产的目的，而不致使整风与生产脱节。邵阳县红石乡的青山农业社，原来劳动管理很差，有的队长不负责，社员找不到事做，妇女出工的很少。整风开始后，社员们在这方面提了许多意见。社委会便马上研究改进劳动管理。除教育生产队长认真负起责任外，并根据当时的生产情况，把冬种进行了“三包”，对妇女的出工也作了具体安排。另外，对社里看牛工分订得不够合理，生猪饲料土没有分到户等问题，也及时作了处理。这就使整风和生产密切地配合起来了。
    试点社的经验也证明，在整风中重视整改，才能使群众更乐于提意见，畅所欲言，并愿意积极地参加辩论。新邵县中长冲铺社在鸣放开始时，有一部分社员虽然一边提意见，但一边又在观察领导上是不是有改进工作的诚意和决心。工作组干部和社领导了解这一情况后，便决定把当时能改进的工作立即改进。这样一来，党群、干群关系进一步改善了，社员们也更愿意提意见了。有的人认为生产队和耕作区划分得不合理，也提了出来。而社里对这样的事情也很快进行了研究、处理。仅在鸣放中这个社就处理了全社性的大事十四件，局部性的事五十件。正由于这样，社里的大鸣大放也形成了高潮。
    边整风、边改进，有些社总结出了不少经验。衡南赐山农业社的干部见到群众提的意见很多，要同时齐头并进来改进确实有困难。于是在鸣放时社里便选择与当前生产或整风有重大关系的事先改，其他的则向群众说明，稍迟一下一定改。同时，要改进工作也并不是一个简单的事情，有些事情并不是几个人一说就可解决的。这个社还注意走群众路线，让大家出主意、想办法，提出改进工作的建设性的意见。不论改进任何工作，都注意按政策办事，避免了纠正这一方面的偏向又出现了另一方面的偏向。因而，改进的工作都得到了群众的拥护。
