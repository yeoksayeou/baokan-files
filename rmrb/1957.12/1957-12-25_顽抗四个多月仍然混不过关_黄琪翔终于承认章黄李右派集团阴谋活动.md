Xinhua News Agency, 24th. The China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party Central Rectification Leading Committee held consecutive enlarged rectification meetings in mid-December to further expose and criticize the anti-Communist and anti-socialist crimes of rightist Huang Qixiang.

Since his anti-Communist and anti-socialist true colors were exposed in July this year, rightist Huang Qixiang has stubbornly resisted for more than four months, refusing to confess his anti-Communist and anti-socialist crimes and the conspiratorial activities of the Zhang (Bojun)-Huang (Qixiang)-Li (Boqiu) rightist clique, attempting to muddle through. After continuous struggle at the enlarged meeting, Huang Qixiang, after his two-faced tactics were thoroughly exposed, finally had to admit some of the exposed crimes and the conspiratorial activities of the Zhang-Huang-Li rightist clique, expressing his willingness to turn over a new leaf.

Many facts revealed at the meeting showed that Huang Qixiang was an extremely cunning rightist ringleader who was good at using two-faced tactics. He was extremely hostile to the socialist system and launched venomous attacks on it. He fabricated the slander that "it is difficult for democratic personages to work in the government," and said that this "is a problem of the system." He hypocritically said that "socialism is good," but then said: "We must also give the people practical things. If they cannot survive now, there will be problems." He also said: "Now there are some unpleasant things, including political work and cultural life, ... work seems to be forced, and we have to live this way." He often promoted a capitalist lifestyle. Huang Qixiang opposed the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops after the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary, and insisted that exposing the subversive activities of American imperialism in Hungary "is unfair." Huang Qixiang opposed our country's people's democratic dictatorship, and he slandered that China is now undemocratic, and attacked the people's dictatorship over the enemy. He believed that the crushing of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was making a mountain out of a molehill, and that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries created distrust between people, and it is unnecessary to understand everything for a little thing."

Huang Qixiang openly opposed the leadership of the Communist Party, saying that "the Communist Party monopolizes everything and is undemocratic." Like Zhang Bojun and others, he opposed the joint instructions issued by the Party and the government, saying that the establishment of offices by the State Council above the various ministries was a violation of the constitution. He also slandered and insulted the leading cadres of the Communist Party and the state, and attempted to abstract the Party's leadership with the absurd argument of "accepting the Communist Party's leadership does not mean accepting the leadership of Communist Party members," using the pretext of not accepting the leadership of Party members to actually negate the Communist Party's leadership.

It was revealed at the meeting that Huang Qixiang occupied an extremely important position in the Zhang-Huang-Li rightist clique, playing an important role in uniting the rightists, bewitching and attracting the middle, and attacking progressives. He also played an important role in planning and implementing the Zhang-Huang-Li rightist clique's organizational policy of malignant development. He personally went out to solicit senior intellectuals to join the China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, and hindered some senior intellectuals from applying to join the Communist Party, saying: "If you join the Communist Party, you may not be able to bear some organizational discipline constraints. It is more appropriate to participate in democratic parties." Until the anti-rightist struggle began this year, on June 10, he also issued an official document to the organization of the China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party in Tianjin, which stated: "In order to adapt to the needs of the situation, your meeting will proceed to develop as soon as possible on the basis of mobilizing members to help the CCP rectify and expand mass contacts," "I hope to fully grasp the favorable conditions of the current situation and further carry out work." At the beginning of the anti-rightist struggle, Huang Qixiang used various methods to try to protect Zhang Bojun from muddling through.

Many people pointed out in their speeches that Huang Qixiang usually did not speak much and rarely expressed opinions directly, but he was very good at using covert methods to arrange and plan, and fan the flames. For example, at a symposium on the principle of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, Huang Qixiang did not say a word at the beginning, and only when the meeting had been going on for a while and had been in a cold state for a long time did he suddenly raise that someone had ranked the Jiusan Society ahead of the China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, saying that from this material, "we can study and study, whether this is the Communist Party's idea of big party and small party?" to provoke the relationship between the Communist Party and the China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party. Some of the reactionary remarks made by Huang Qixiang were also cleverly disguised. In a report, he once said, "Imperialists ridicule us for being undemocratic. Judging from our shortcomings, it needs to be improved." He even affirmed that the imperialists' slander of us was a fact.

The meeting also exposed the two-faced tactics that Huang Qixiang played in his false self-criticism at the fourth session of the National People's Congress in July this year. In that self-criticism, Huang Qixiang shamelessly said that he
“In the past twenty years, his thoughts have never left the Communist Party for a moment, and even in the most difficult days, I have never been able to leave the Communist Party;…” But the fact is completely the opposite: Huang Qixiang was a warlord and long depended on Chen Cheng. On June 18, 1938, he published a notorious essay "Combat and China" in the Hankou Dagongbao, in which he attacked the Communist Party and the revolutionary base areas, saying: "The so-called partisan strife and opposition in politics is a headache to mention, and local regimes are like separatists, making it impossible for unified government orders to be smoothly implemented." The article also nauseatingly praised Chiang Kai-shek as "an oriental giant commonly respected by people all over the world," fervently wanting to "support a leader and a government." During the era of the Old Political Consultative Conference, when the domestic democratic movement was surging, he served as Chiang Kai-shek's head of the military delegation to West Germany. On the eve of the liberation, he was summoned back to China by Chiang Kai-shek and traveled between Nanjing, Taiwan, and Hong Kong; after he arrived in Beijing in 1949, he also clamored that he "wanted to return to Hong Kong." These are his twenty years of ugly reactionary history, and prove that his so-called not being able to leave the Communist Party for a moment is completely a lie.

At the beginning of this enlarged meeting, Huang Qixiang's attitude was very bad. Although he had to admit that his anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds were impossible to hide, and that the Zhang-Huang-Li rightist clique existed, he did not confess specific facts, and also adopted a sophistical and defensive attitude, which aroused great indignation among the participants. It was not until later, after the exposure and criticism of Ji Fang, He Shikun, Xu Binru, Zhuang Mingyuan, Fang Rongxin, Hu Yihe and others, that he had to bow his head in the face of a large number of facts and confessed some reactionary words and deeds. He admitted that "after 1956, with Zhang Bojun as the head, there was a Zhang-Huang-Li rightist clique formed by me and Li Boqiu." They "all believed that the international and domestic situation was about to change, and the Communist Party could not handle it alone," so they "did everything possible to grasp the leadership of the China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party. Using the China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party as a legal organization to carry out illegal activities, engaging in core leadership within the China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, uniting the backward, and attacking the progressives," admitting that they "tampered with the political and organizational lines of the China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party from the aspects of thought, speech, and action, turning a political party that should serve socialism into a political party that serves capitalism," "used the opportunity of the CCP's rectification to launch an attack on the Party and socialism, causing extremely bad influence in society." He also admitted that he did indeed carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities with hidden two-faced tactics.

### 顽抗四个多月仍然混不过关  黄琪翔终于承认章黄李右派集团阴谋活动

    顽抗四个多月仍然混不过关
    黄琪翔终于承认章黄李右派集团阴谋活动
    新华社24日讯　中国农工民主党中央整风领导委员会在12月中旬连续举行整风扩大会议，进一步揭发和批判右派分子黄琪翔的反共反社会主义罪行。
    右派分子黄琪翔自从他的反共反社会主义真面目在今年7月被揭露以后，四个多月来一直负隅顽抗，拒不交代他的反共反社会主义的罪行和章（伯钧）黄（琪翔）李（伯球）右派集团的阴谋活动，企图蒙混过关。经过扩大会议的连续斗争，黄琪翔在他的两面派手法被彻底揭破以后，终于不得不承认被揭露的一些罪行和章黄李右派集团的阴谋活动，表示愿意重新作人。
    会上揭露出来的许多事实说明，黄琪翔是一个极端狡猾的善于使用两面手法的右派头子。他极为敌视社会主义制度，并且对社会主义制度进行了恶毒的攻击。他捏造出所谓“民主人士难以在政府工作”的谰言，并说这“是制度问题”。他假惺惺地说“社会主义是好的”，但是接着却说：“也要给人民实际的东西，目前活不下去，就会有问题”。他还说：“现在是有些不愉快，包括政治工作文化生活各方面，……工作好像是被迫似的，非这样生活不可”。他经常宣扬资本主义生活方式。黄琪翔反对苏联在匈牙利反革命暴乱后出兵，并且硬说揭露美帝国主义在匈牙利进行颠复活动“是不公平的”。黄琪翔反对我国的人民民主专政，他诬蔑中国现在不民主，并攻击人民对敌人的专政。他认为粉碎胡风反革命集团是小题大作，“肃反运动造成了人与人之间的不信任，为了一点事就到处了解没有必要”。
    黄琪翔露骨地反对共产党的领导，他说“共产党包办一切，不民主”。他和章伯钧等一样反对党和政府发布联合指示，说国务院在各部之上设立办公室是违背宪法的。他还污蔑辱骂共产党和国家的领导干部，并以“接受共产党的领导，不等于接受共产党员的领导”这种荒谬的说法，企图把党的领导抽象化，以不接受党员的领导为幌子，来实际否定共产党的领导。
    会上揭露，黄琪翔在章、黄、李右派集团中居于极其重要的地位，在团结右派、迷惑拉拢中间、打击进步方面扮演着重要的角色，在策划和贯彻执行章、黄、李右派集团恶性大发展的组织方针上，也起着重要的作用。他曾亲自出马拉高级知识分子参加农工民主党，并阻挠有的高级知识分子申请参加共产党，他说：“入了共产党，一些组织纪律的约束，也不一定受得了，还是参加民主党派比较合适”。直至今年反右派斗争开始以后，他在6月10日还签发了一件公文给天津市农工民主党的组织，上面写道：“为了适应形势需要，你会在发动成员帮助中共整风、扩大群众联系的基础上，应从速进行发展”，“希望充分把握当前形势有利条件，进一步开展工作”。在反右派斗争刚开始的时候，黄琪翔曾使用了种种办法企图保护章伯钧蒙混过关。
    会上许多人在发言中，都特别指出黄琪翔平时言语不多，很少正面发表意见，但却非常善于用隐蔽手法布置策划，煽风点火。如在某次座谈长期共存、互相监督方针的会上，黄琪翔开始一言不发，直到会议进行到一段时候冷场了很久时，他才突然提出有人把九三学社排在农工民主党前面，说是从这个材料，“可以研究研究，这是否是共产党有大党小党的思想？”借以挑拨共产党和农工民主党的关系。黄琪翔发表的一些反动言论，也都巧妙地加以伪装，他在一次报告中曾说过，“帝国主义讥讽我们不民主，以我们的缺点来看，是需要改进。”竟然肯定帝国主义对我们的污蔑是事实。
    会上还戳穿了黄琪翔今年7月在全国人民代表大会第四次会议上假检讨中玩弄的两面派手法，黄琪翔在那次检讨中恬不知耻地说是他
  “二十年间，思想上没有一时一刻离开共产党，即令在最艰苦的日子里，我也从来不忍离开共产党；……”但是事实却完全相反：黄琪翔是一个军阀，长期依附陈诚。1938年6月18日他在汉口大公报上发表了一篇臭名远扬的“战斗与中国”的论文，文中攻击共产党和革命根据地说：“政治上所谓党派的倾轧与对立，提起来令人头痛，地方政权形同割据，使统一政令不能顺利推行。”文中并令人作呕地吹捧蒋介石是“全世界人士所共同崇敬的一个东方巨人”，狂热地要“拥护一个领袖、一个政府”。当旧政协时代，国内民主运动高涨，他却担任了蒋介石驻西德的军事代表团团长，解放前夕又奉蒋介石电召回国，往来于南京、台湾、香港之间；1949年他到北京以后还扬言“要回到香港去”。这些就是他二十年间丑恶的反动历史，并证明他的所谓一时一刻不忍离开共产党完全是谎言。
    黄琪翔在这次扩大会议开始的时候，态度表现得甚为恶劣。他虽然不得不承认自己的反共反社会主义言行是无法掩饰的，承认章黄李右派集团是存在的，但却不交代具体事实，还采取了狡辩抵赖的态度，这些都引起了与会群众极大的愤慨。直到后来，经过季方、何世琨、徐彬如、庄明远、方荣欣、胡一禾等人的揭露和批判，他才不得不在大量事实面前低下头来，交代了一些反动言行。他承认“在1956年以后，以章伯钧为首，有我和李伯球形成了章黄李右派集团”。他们“都认为国际国内形势要变，共产党一党搞不下去了”，因而“尽一切办法把农工民主党的领导权掌握在手里。利用农工民主党这个合法组织，进行非法活动，在农工民主党内搞核心领导，团结落后，打击进步”，承认他们“是从思想、言论、行动上篡改了农工民主党的政治路线与组织路线，把应该为社会主义服务的政党变成了为资本主义服务的政党”，“利用中共整风的时机，向党向社会主义进行了进攻，在社会上造成了极坏的影响”。他还承认自己确实是以隐蔽的两面派手法进行反党反社会主义的活动。
