　　A Muddled Account
　　In a speech advocating for intensifying the arms race, Nixon told the American people: "We must remember that no matter how much we like to reduce taxes and improve living standards, it will make no difference if we cannot enjoy it." At the same time, he pointed out that since they must engage in "defense efforts," it is impossible to reduce taxes.
　　Thus, Nixon presented the American people with such a muddled account: To enjoy the benefits of reducing taxes and improving living standards, they must engage in arms expansion and war preparation; but to engage in arms expansion and war preparation, they cannot hope to reduce taxes.
　　Of course, in the shrewd calculations of American arms dealers, this is one plus one equals two.

    一笔混账
    尼克松在鼓吹加紧军备竞赛的一次谈话中，向美国人民说：“我们一定要记住，不管我们多么喜欢减低捐税和提高生活水平，这将没有什么区别，假如我们不能享受的话。”同时，他又指出，既然要从事“防御努力”，就不可能减低捐税。
    于是，尼克松摆在美国人民面前的就是这样一笔混账：要想享受减低捐税和提高生活水平的好处，就必须从事扩军备战；而要扩军备战，又不能希望减低捐税。
    当然，在美国军火商人的精明的算盘上，这是一加一等于二。
