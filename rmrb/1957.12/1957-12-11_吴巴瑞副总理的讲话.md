Speech by Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe

Dear and respected Premier Zhou Enlai, friends:

Today, my wife, all members of the delegation and I express our heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese government, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, for their kinship-like welcome. Just as close relatives who have traveled far bring deep feelings when visiting relatives, we also bring the deep feelings of the Burmese people to all the Chinese people from Burma.

Just now, my good friend, Premier, said that this year is a particularly frequent year for friendly exchanges between China and Burma. This can be best proved by my joint visit to China with Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein.

Although I have not been to China, I have long heard that China has achieved great achievements in construction since liberation. Now, I have the opportunity to personally prove this, and for this, I express my gratitude once again for this invitation.

Dear Premier, you just described the friendship between Burma and China as an unceasing flow of water. This metaphor is very suitable for expressing the friendship between our two countries, so I would like to add to it.

Burma and China are neighbors, and the two countries have a long border. Because of this, we have frequent exchanges. The border residents of the two countries interact with each other and form kinship. The territories of Burma and China are connected, and the people of the two countries share the water of the same river. For example, the Salween River originates in China and then flows into the sea via Burma. The Burmese brethren in China drink the water of this river first, and then the Burmese people can drink the water of this river. Therefore, the people of our two countries can be called ethnic groups who share the same water. The situation of the Ruili River is also the same. Therefore, the people of our two countries not only share the same water, but also live closely together on the same land. Therefore, we call the Chinese "Pauk-Phaw" (brethren), which is not without basis.

Premier has already said that the friendship between Burma and China did not arise today. Due to the proximity of the two countries, exchanges and friendship have further developed. There are almost no differences of opinion between the two countries. In ancient times, when transportation was underdeveloped, we were able to have very close exchanges. In the new era of scientific development, there is no doubt that our exchanges will be even more frequent. I firmly believe that through these close exchanges, our relationship will develop further and become closer.

As I mentioned, the friendship between our two countries is not only caused by geographical and historical reasons, but also by our shared destiny. As Premier has said, for many years, the people of our two countries have experienced an era in which they could not determine their own destiny. Therefore, we understand each other's feelings and demands. Due to our shared destiny, we are driven to think about our respective countries and nations, follow our own habits and preferences, take our own path, and carry out our own work. We do not interfere in each other's internal affairs and carry out peaceful construction. Our country is very backward because it has lost its right to self-determination for many years. Coupled with the destruction of World War II, it has made things worse, and it is even more necessary for us to carry out construction.

Therefore, our two countries should not be satisfied with the current close and friendly relations, but continue to work hard to make the relations between the leaders, classes, scholars and other aspects of the two countries closer, and strive to establish a lasting friendship like the unceasing flow of water mentioned by Premier.

The whole world is watching the exchanges between our two countries. Therefore, I hope to use the facts to show that the relationship between our two countries can be a model of close relations.

Under the guidance of the Five Principles, let us form a fraternal friendly relationship, regardless of large or small nationalities, large or small countries, or skin color.

Now, in this new era, we are building our own countries according to our respective specific conditions.

Therefore, our relationship can be mutually understanding and know each other's demands.

Secondly, as Premier said just now, the cultures of our two countries are very close, and we have a common desire for peace and support the Five Principles. Our two countries have accepted the principle that, despite different political views and economic structures, cooperation is still possible between countries. Our two countries have also accepted the principle that international disputes can be resolved through peaceful consultation.

Although this is my first time to China, I feel that I am in my own relatives' home because of the very deep friendship between our two countries.

This time, due to time constraints, I cannot visit more places in China, nor can I make more new friends. Therefore, I am not satisfied with this visit. In order to accept the Premier's invitation again, in order to better learn from China, and in order to make more new friends, I plan to visit China again. Similarly, I would also like to invite Chinese leaders, including the Premier, to visit Burma at a time they deem appropriate.

Finally, let us all raise our glasses together:

To the health of Premier Zhou Enlai and the Chinese leaders,
To the longevity of Chairman Mao Zedong,
To the lasting friendship between Burma and China, cheers!

### 吴巴瑞副总理的讲话

1957-12-11
第4版()
专栏：

　　吴巴瑞副总理的讲话亲爱的、尊敬的周恩来总理阁下：诸位朋友们：
    今天，我和我的夫人及全体团员，对以周恩来总理为首的中国政府的如亲戚般的欢迎表示衷心的感谢。正如远来的至亲带着深厚感情去探亲一样，我们也从缅甸带来了缅甸人民对全体中国人民的深厚感情。
    刚才，我的好友总理阁下说，今年是中缅两国友好往来特别频繁的一年，关于这一点，可从这次我与副总理吴觉迎共同访问中国得到最好的证明。
    我虽然没有到过中国，但是我早已听说中国在解放后的建设已经获得巨大的成就。现在，我已经有机会亲自来证明这一点，为此，我对这次的邀请表示再一次的感谢。
    亲爱的总理阁下，阁下刚才又以切不断的流水来形容我们缅中两国的友谊，这个比喻很适合于表达我们两国的友谊，所以我想再加以补充。
    缅甸和中国是邻邦，两国有很长的边界相接，由于这样，我们之间的来往很频繁。两国的边民相互往来，结成了亲戚关系。缅中两国疆土相连，两国人民共饮一条江的水。比如，萨尔温江是发源于中国，然后经缅甸流入大海。在中国的胞波们，首先饮了这条江的水，而后缅甸人民才能饮到这条江的水。因此，我们两国人民是可以称为共饮一种水的民族。瑞丽江的情况也是如此。所以，我们两国人民不但共饮一种水，而且在同一块土地上亲密的共同居住在一起。因此，我们称呼中国人是胞波，并不是没有任何根据的。
    总理阁下已说过，缅中友谊不是今天才产生的。由于两国的邻近而相互间的来往和友谊有了进一步的发展。两国之间几乎没有意见分歧。在交通工具不发达的古代，我们既然能够很密切地来往，而在科学发达的新时代里，毫无疑问我们的来往一定更加频繁。我深信通过这些密切的来往，我们之间的关系是会更加发展和密切。
    正如我所提到的，我们两国的友谊不仅是地理和历史上的原因所造成的，共同的命运也造成了我们两国的友谊。如总理阁下所讲过的，许多年来，我们两国人民经历了不能决定自己命运的时代。因此，我们互相了解对方的感受和要求。由于共同的命运，促使我们为了我们各自的国家民族着想，按自己的习惯和爱好，走自己的道路，进行自己的工作。不互相干涉内政，并进行和平建设。我们的国家由于许多年来失掉了自决权，而非常落后。又加上第二次世界大战的破坏，使我们祸上加祸，而更有必要来进行建设。
    因此，我们两国应该不满足于目前亲密的友好关系，而继续为两国的领袖之间、阶层之间、学者之间等各方面的关系，更加密切而努力，为建立像刚才总理阁下所说的切不断的流水般的持久友谊而努力。
    全世界在观望着我们两国之间的交往。因此，我希望以事实来表示我们两国的关系是可以示范的亲密关系。
    让我们在五项原则的指导下，不分大民族和小民族，不分大国和小国，不分肤色的黑白，结成亲兄弟般的友好关系。
    现在，我们又在这个新的时代里，根据各自的具体情况，建设自己的国家。
    所以，我们的关系才能够相互谅解，并且知道相互间的要求。
    其次，正如刚才总理阁下所说的，我们两国的文化是很接近的，而且有共同的和平愿望，并支持五项原则。我们两国已经接受了这样的原则，即：在国与国之间，尽管政治主张不同，经济结构不同，仍然可以合作。我们两国还接受了这样的原则，即国际间的争端是可以通过和平协商的办法来解决。
    虽然我这次到中国来是第一次，但是由于我们两国的友谊非常深厚，使我感到我现在是在自己亲戚家里一样。
    这一次，由于时间的关系，我不可能在中国多访问一些地方，同时也不可能多结识一些新朋友。因此，我对这次的访问是不满足的。为了接受总理的再次邀请，为了能够更好的学习中国，为了结识更多的新朋友，我打算再次来中国访问。同样地，我也愿意邀请包括总理在内的中国领袖们，在他们认为适当的时机到缅甸访问。
    最后，让我们大家共同举杯：
    为周恩来总理和中国领袖们健康，
    为毛泽东主席长寿无疆，
    为缅中两国的持久友谊，干杯！
