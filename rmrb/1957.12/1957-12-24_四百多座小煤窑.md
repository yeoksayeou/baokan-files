    More Than Four Hundred Small Coal Mines
    As of mid-November, Shanxi Province had restored a total of 440 small coal mines this year, increasing coal production by 789,710 tons.
    The restoration of small coal mines has solved the problem of coal shortages in some areas. For example, Shanyin County used to be a coal-deficient area, and all civilian fuel was transferred from Ningwu and other counties. This year, three small coal mines were restored, which not only fully met the needs of the county, but also can supply neighboring counties. (Ma Dengke, et al.)

    四百多座小煤窑
    山西省截至11月中旬为止，今年全省共恢复了小煤窑四百四十座，增产煤炭七十八万九千七百一十吨。
    小煤窑的恢复，解决了缺煤地区的烧煤问题，如山阴县过去是个缺煤区，民用燃料全部由宁武等县调来，今年恢复了三座小煤窑，不仅完全满足了本县需要，还可以供应邻县。　（马登科等）
