    Energetic People
    Shi Yuzhong
    In the courtyard of the Beijing People's Machinery Factory, there is an open space. Although it is not large, hundreds of workers engage in sports activities there every day after work. Playing basketball, wrestling, kicking shuttlecock, jumping rope… you name it.
    Look, a group of workers are walking over with a ball. They take off their coats, do some warm-up exercises, and then divide into two teams to play basketball. These people are not young, but they are as lively as tigers. Look at the old worker and Beijing Model Laborer, Zhu Tanlin, jumping, turning and shooting, so light and accurate; the thirty-four-year-old Huang Chuanzhong’s layup is so coordinated and graceful. They are all members of the "Seasoned" basketball team.
    More and more people are participating in sports activities. The female worker Liu Guomin and her companions are jumping rope, the worker Zhu Yongcheng is doing a handstand backflip on the parallel bars, and the strongmen Hu Qinglu and He Shijie are wrestling on the ground in wrestling suits, neither being able to throw the other. A burst of laughter came from the Second Workshop. It turned out that the thirty-eight-year-old old worker and section chief Hu Xiangkui was kicking shuttlecock with everyone. They carry out their activities in the open space next to the machines, single-foot kicks, double-foot kicks, turn kicks, reverse-foot kicks, two-person kicks, collective kicks… the variety is extreme.
    In the spring of 1954, the factory held a basketball competition, and the teams from each workshop were all made up of young lads. The old workers didn't even have a chance. Zhang Wenhua, the thirty-eight-year-old deputy director of the factory, who has always loved sports, organized all the old workers in the factory who loved sports and formed the "Seasoned" basketball team. Its meaning is that even when you are old, you still have to exercise.
    One day, the "Seasoned" team competed against the factory team. Deputy Director Zhang Wenhua kept shooting the ball into the basket, and he became the scoring ace of the "Seasoned" team. They finally defeated the factory team with a score of forty-six to forty-four. From then on, the "Seasoned" team established prestige among the masses. Under its influence, more and more young workers, and also more and more old workers, appeared on the sports field of the Beijing People's Machinery Factory.

    朝气蓬勃的人们
    施毓忠
    北京人民机器厂的院子里，有一块空地，虽然不大，但是，每天下工以后，却有数以百计的工人在那里进行体育活动。打篮球、摔跤、踢毽子、跳绳……什么都有。
    看，一伙工人提着球走过来了，他们脱去外衣，做了一些准备活动后，分成两队打起篮球来，这些人的年纪都已经不小了，但是他们活动起来却像生龙活虎似的。看，老工人、北京市劳动模范朱谈林的跳起转身投篮，是那样的轻巧而准确；三十四岁的黄传忠的三步上篮的姿势多么协调和优美，他们都是“老炼”篮球队队员。
    参加体育活动的人，越来越多了。女工刘国敏和她的同伴正在跳绳，工人朱永成在双杠上来了个倒立后空翻，大力士胡庆禄、何士杰穿着摔跤衣在地上扭来扭去，谁也摔不倒谁。一阵欢笑声从第二车间传送出来，原来三十八岁的老工人、工段长扈相奎正在和大家踢毽子，他们的活动就在机器旁边的空地上进行，单足踢、双足踢、转身踢、反足踢、双人对踢、集体踢……花样多极了。
    1954年春季，厂里举行篮球竞赛，各个车间代表队全都由一些年青小伙子组成，老工人连份儿都没有。一向爱好体育运动的三十八岁的老工人、副厂长张文华，把厂里所有爱好运动的老工人组织在一起，成立了“老炼”篮球队。它的意思就是年纪老了还要进行锻炼。
    一天，“老炼”队和厂代表队进行比赛，副厂长张文华不断地往篮里投球，他成了“老炼”队的得分能手。他们终于以四十六比四十四战胜了厂代表队。从此，“老炼”队在群众中树立了威信。在它的影响下，北京人民机器厂的运动场上，不但越来越多地出现了青年工人，也越来越多地出现了老工人。
