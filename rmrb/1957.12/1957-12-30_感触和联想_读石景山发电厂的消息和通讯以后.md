    Feelings and Associations
    ——After Reading News and Reports from the Shijingshan Power Plant
    Chen Zhiyan
    It may be too early to fully assess the enormous achievements and far-reaching impact of this nationwide rectification movement, but one thing is certain: the ideological outlook of millions of people has changed during the movement, and socialism is closer to everyone. This change will become a huge driving force for promoting progress in all aspects of work.

    Not long ago, some people had doubts and various concerns about the socialist mass education method of "speaking out freely, airing views fully, and holding great debates." Now, countless facts have shattered these doubts and concerns.

    The excessively high bonus and welfare standards of the Shijingshan Power Plant were a recognized and thorny problem in the past. "Once it's up, can it come down?" It was indeed a difficult matter to handle. However, the method of "speaking out freely, airing views fully, and holding great debates" not only solved this problem but also killed two birds with one stone. Through debate, the ideological outlook of the masses also underwent tremendous changes, and socialist thinking rose. Reader comrades, you will feel this point when you read the report "Young People are More Adorable."

    Socialism means "upstairs and downstairs, electric lights and telephones." Some time ago, such a simple but somewhat misguided saying was popular in some rural areas. This simplistic understanding of socialism contains an element of treating future ideals as present realities. This kind of thinking exists not only among peasants but also among workers. Didn't some workers at the Shijingshan Power Plant say, "Workers produce to create wealth for the country, so why should we pay rent for housing?"

    Socialism, of course, means happiness and prosperity, meaning that everyone eats well, dresses well, and lives well. This is the fundamental goal that we communists strive for throughout our lives. But this beautiful vision will not come in an instant. It requires us to achieve this goal after long-term hard work and the creation of a strong material foundation. And in a country like ours, which is both poor and blank, it cannot be done in the short term. At one time, we did not talk about this enough, and there were also shortcomings in certain systems, which caused some people, especially some young workers, to have illusions, treating long-term ideals as immediate demands, believing that all welfare should be covered by the state and should be continuously improved, which is called socialism. This is actually an incorrect understanding of the current relations of production and distribution. If we really do this, socialism cannot be ultimately established.

    But as long as we bring this issue to the masses for debate, things will become clear. Isn't the example of the Shijingshan Power Plant like this? However, we must also pay attention in the actual handling process to ensure that the living standards of the old workers are not inappropriately reduced.

    Everything becomes clearer after comparison. Since liberation, especially in the first Five-Year Plan, we have done many good things for the masses. Without calculating the national total, the six accounts calculated by the workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant in the debate are enough to show that only the people's government cares most about the vital interests of the people. And what was it like before liberation? This is familiar to many workers. A comparison reveals the truth. But before the debate, some people at the Shijingshan Power Plant also said this: "What era was the past? What era is the present? Comparing the present with the past is looking backward and driving in reverse." This statement is only half true. Indeed, we have always looked forward and never backward. Our aspirations are very lofty. Compared with the brilliant prospects of future communism, the achievements we have already made can be said to be insignificant. But we will not forget what kind of life Chinese workers lived before liberation. Only by thinking about the past and comparing it with the present can we inspire us to forge ahead courageously.

    Those who say that comparing with the past is "looking backward and driving in reverse" are mostly young people who grew up after liberation. It can be said that they have no or little experience of the painful lives of workers in the old society. As long as the old workers patiently compare and calculate for them, and let them see the hard and simple lives of their peasant brothers, their thinking will be easily straightened out. The thinking of many young workers at the Shijingshan Power Plant has changed in this way.

    In socialist society, there are also contradictions among the people. The contradiction between individual interests and the collective and national interests is one of the manifestations of this internal contradiction. Its essence is the contradiction between accumulation and consumption distribution, which is a very complex and broad issue. Precisely because of this, it was not easy to convince people at once to reduce the excessively high bonus and welfare standards at the Shijingshan Power Plant. But because we are a socialist country, the working class is the master of the country, and the fundamental interests of the working class are completely consistent with the interests of the country, as long as we trust the majority of the masses, put the issues out in the open for the masses to debate, rather than using coercive methods, the problem can be solved. Chairman Mao said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People":

    "The contradictions of capitalist society are manifested in fierce antagonism and conflict, manifested in fierce class struggle. Such contradictions cannot be resolved by the capitalist system itself, but can only be resolved by socialist revolution. The contradictions of socialist society are another matter. On the contrary, they are not antagonistic contradictions, and they can be continuously resolved through the socialist system itself." The fact is that the method of "speaking out freely, airing views fully, and holding great debates" during the rectification movement has solved many problems that were considered difficult to solve in the past. And only under the socialist system can there be such a high degree of extensive democracy. Isn't this also very obvious?

    感触和联想
    ——读石景山发电厂的消息和通讯以后
    陈之衍
    现在就来全面估价这一次全民整风运动的巨大成果和它的深远影响，可能还为时过早，但是有一点可以确定：千百万人的思想面貌在运动中发生变化，社会主义离每个人更近了。这个变化将成为推动各方面工作前进的巨大动力。
    就在不久以前，有的人对大鸣大放大辩论这个社会主义的群众性的教育方法还发生怀疑，还存在各式各样的顾虑，现在无数事实把这种怀疑这些顾虑统统打破了。
    石景山发电厂的奖励和福利标准过高，这在过去是一个公认的棘手的问题。“上去了还能下来吗？”事情确实不大好办。可是大鸣大放大辩论不仅把这个问题解决了，而且一箭双雕，通过辩论，群众的思想面貌也起了极大的变化，社会主义的思想上升了。读者同志们，你们读一读“年青人更加可爱了”这篇通讯就会感觉到这一点。
    社会主义就是“楼上楼下，电灯电话”。前些时，在一些农村里流行着这样一种朴素的但是有某种错觉的说法。这种对于社会主义的简单理解，包含着一种把将来的理想当作眼前的现实的因素。这种思想不仅在农民中间有，在工人中间也有。石景山发电厂有的工人不是这样说吗：“工人生产是给国家创造财富，为什么住房子还要收房租？”
    社会主义当然就是意味着幸福和繁荣，意味着人人吃得好、穿得好、住得好，这是我们共产党人毕生为之奋斗的根本目标。但是这种美景并不是转瞬即到的，它需要我们经过长期的艰苦劳动，创造了强大的物质基础之后，才能达到这个目标。而在我们这样一个又穷又白的国家里，更不是短期内所能办到的。有一个时候，我们在这方面讲得很不够，在某些制度上也有缺点，因此就使得有些人特别是一部分青年工人产生错觉，把长远的理想也当成眼前的要求，以为一切福利都应当由国家包下来，而且应当不断地提高，这才叫社会主义。这实际上是对目前生产和分配关系的不正确的理解。如果真的这样做，社会主义就不能最终建立起来。
    但是只要我们把这个问题拿到群众中去辩论，事情就会弄明白，石景山发电厂的例子不正是这样吗？不过我们也要注意在实际处理的过程中，要照顾到不要不适当地降低了老工人的生活水平。
    任何事情一经过对比就容易看得清楚。解放以后特别是在第一个五年计划中，我们为群众办了许许多多的好事，不必算全国的总账，就从石景山发电厂的工人在辩论中算的六笔账，也足以说明只有人民的政府才最关心人民群众的切身利益。而解放以前是怎样呢？这是许许多多工人都熟悉的，一比就比出个究竟。可是石景山发电厂在辩论以前也有人这么说：“过去是什么时代？现在是什么时代？拿现在和过去比，就是向后看，就是开倒车”。这话只有一半道理。确实我们从来就是向前看而不向后看的，我们的志向远大得很，已有的成就和将来共产主义的光辉远景比较起来，可以说是微不足道的。但是我们也不会忘记解放以前我国工人过的是什么样的生活，只有想想过去，比比现在，才能激励我们奋勇前进。
    说和过去比就是“向后看，开倒车”的人，多半是在解放以后成长起来的年轻人，可以说他们对旧社会工人的痛苦生活是没有感受或者感受不深的。只要老工人耐心地给他们比比算算，再让他们亲眼看看农民兄弟的艰苦朴素的生活，他们的思想就容易通了。石景山发电厂许多青年工人的思想正是这样改变的。
    在社会主义社会里也存在着人民内部的矛盾。个人利益与集体、国家利益的矛盾正是这种内部矛盾的表现形式之一。它的实质是积累和消费的分配的矛盾，这是一个很复杂、牵涉面很广的问题。正因如此，所以石景山发电厂要把过高的奖励和福利标准降下来，就不是一下可以说通的。但是因为我们是社会主义国家，工人阶级是国家的主人，工人阶级的根本利益和国家的利益完全一致，只要我们相信群众的大多数，把问题摆开来让群众争辩，而不是用强迫的办法，问题就可以得到解决。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中说：
    “资本主义社会的矛盾表现为剧烈的对抗和冲突，表现为剧烈的阶级斗争，那种矛盾不可能由资本主义制度本身来解决，而只有社会主义革命才能够加以解决。社会主义社会的矛盾是另一回事，恰恰相反，它不是对抗性的矛盾，它可以经过社会主义制度本身，不断地得到解决”。事实正是这样，整风中间大鸣大放大辩论解决了许多历来认为很难解决的问题。而只有在社会主义制度下，才能有这种高度的、广泛的民主，这不也是很显然的吗？
