Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 12th: Moscow newspapers published on December 12th a letter from the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Bulganin, to the President of the United States, Eisenhower, dated December 10th.

In this letter, Bulganin suggested to the US President that the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Great Britain jointly undertake the obligation not to use nuclear weapons, and to cease all experimental explosions of nuclear weapons from January 1, 1958, even if only for a period of two or three years.

Bulganin also suggested that the governments of the USSR, the United States, and Great Britain jointly reach an agreement: not to deploy any kind of nuclear weapons on German territory—whether West or East Germany.

In the letter, Bulganin suggested formulating a joint proposal and submitting it to the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the member states of the Warsaw Treaty for discussion. This joint proposal would advocate signing a non-aggression pact between these two blocs in some form. In order to normalize the situation in the Middle East, let us agree not to take any steps to undermine the independence of the countries in this region, and let us not use force to resolve issues concerning the Middle East.

Bulganin suggested that the Soviet Union and the United States conclude a treaty and declare that both countries firmly advocate the development of friendship and peaceful coexistence between the two countries. Bulganin concluded by saying that we believe that direct contact between national leaders is of great significance, as it can help reach a consensus on major international issues. We, for our part, are prepared to agree to direct meetings between leaders of major powers to discuss the issues mentioned in this letter and other issues that the participants of the meeting deem necessary to discuss.

　　布尔加宁写信向艾森豪威尔建议
    承担禁用核武器义务
    同意大国领导人直接会谈
    据新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科12日讯：莫斯科各报12日发表了苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁12月10日给美国总统艾森豪威尔的一封信。
    布尔加宁在这封信中向美国总统建议苏联、美国和英国的政府共同承担不使用核武器的义务，并且从1958年1月1日起停止各种核武器的试验性爆炸，开始时那怕是为期两三年也好。
    布尔加宁还建议苏、美、英三国政府共同达成协议：不在德国境内——无论是西德或是东德——配置任何种类的核武器。
    布尔加宁在信中建议拟定一个联合建议，并提交北大西洋联盟成员国和华沙条约成员国讨论，这个联合建议就是主张用某种形式签订这两个国家集团互不侵犯的协定。为了使中近东局势正常化，让我们约定，不采取任何破坏这个地区的国家的独立的步骤，并且让我们不使用武力解决有关中近东问题。
    布尔加宁建议苏美两国缔结一个条约，并且宣布两国坚决主张在两国之间发展友谊与和平共处的关系。布尔加宁最后说，我们认为国家领导人的直接接触具有重大的意义，这样做能够有助于在重大的国际问题上取得一致看法，我们这方面也准备同意大国领导人的直接会见，以便讨论这封信里提到的问题以及会见参加者认为需要讨论的其他问题。（布尔加宁给艾森豪威尔的信全文见第五版）
