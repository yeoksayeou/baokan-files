Notes

    The Sound That Cannot Be Taken Away
    When British Foreign Secretary Lloyd was expounding the theory of "mutual dependence" in the House of Commons on the 20th, someone in the public gallery stood up and shouted, "The policy of mutual dependence is an act of treason!" This unknown British person was immediately "taken away."
    Lloyd seems to have "won." But may I ask Mr. Lloyd: can you "take away" the millions of British people who oppose war and demand an independent policy from the British Isles?

    带不走的声音
    英国外交大臣劳埃德20日在下院高谈“互相依赖”论调的时候，公共旁听席上有人起来大声疾呼：“互相依赖政策是卖国行为！”这位不知名的英国人竟立即被“带走”了。
    劳埃德似乎是“胜利”了。可是请问劳埃德先生：你能够把千百万反对战争、要求奉行独立政策的英国人从英伦三岛都“带走”吗？
