　　Our Peasants Live a Civilized Life
　　An Account of the Sun Village, a Hygiene Model Village in Shanxi Province
    By our correspondent Lin Wei

    When people talk about the countryside, they probably associate it with flies crawling on food and bowls, garbage everywhere inside and outside the houses and on the streets, the stench emanating from human, livestock, and poultry excrement, and sleepless nights due to mosquito, fly, flea, louse, and bedbug bites...

    These things seem difficult to change because: first, peasants must raise livestock, chickens, ducks, and pigs, and they must collect fertilizer; second, the countryside lacks sewers and running water, and productivity and people's incomes are not as high as in the cities; one could find several other reasons.

    But the facts prove that, under the leadership of the Communist Party, this situation can be completely changed. Peasants can also live a civilized and hygienic life. Jishan County in Shanxi Province is a clear example.

    The rural areas of Jishan County are like ordinary rural areas. Most of the houses are made of adobe, and the ground inside and outside the houses and on the streets is all earth. The peasants also raise livestock, chickens, and pigs, and they also collect manure. But now, more than half of the villages are very clean and meet the standards of hygiene model villages. In this county, from the city to the outside, from the plains to the plateau, people rarely encounter dirty villages. The villages here are generally tidy and comfortable. Sun Village, which belongs to Dongjiazhuang Township, is praised by all visitors.

      Sun Village is so beautiful and refined
    The willow groves surrounding the village give people a refreshing and pleasant feeling. The main streets and small alleys in the village are flat and smooth. The middle of the street is slightly higher and the sides are slightly lower, just like roads in a city. Even after a long drought, when the nearby highways have several inches of dust, the roads in the village remain smooth and clean because members of the agricultural cooperative sweep the streets in sections every morning. There are also special women's street sweeping teams responsible for sweeping the squares, stages, or intersections that are no one's specific responsibility. If livestock happens to leave manure while passing by, someone will immediately clean it up. At the crossroads, people have built small flower beds with bricks and planted various flowers. Along the sides of the streets, there are public toilets and brick garbage bins every so often. The toilets generally have clean wooden lids, and the pits are sprinkled with alum or 666 powder, or bitter tree bark and roots are placed in them, and some are even padded with soil, so even in the height of summer, not a single maggot will grow. The soil near the pit toilets is regularly and thoroughly replaced by the production team, and the old soil is taken away for fertilizer. The pupae and eggs are all dug out, so flies cannot be born as a result. The garbage bins have lids on top and doors on the sides. Each household pours the swept garbage into the bin from above, and the people from the production team open the door from the side and dig out the garbage to fertilize the fields. The streets here are thus kept clean year-round.

    The farmhouses along both sides of the streets have courtyards that are plastered inside and out until they are smooth, shiny, and neat. The lower half of the outside walls is whitewashed with lime. In the courtyards, no matter which house you go to, it is very bright and clean. Almost all the courtyards have flowers or trees planted in them. There are clean stone tables in the courtyard, where the peasants eat their meals on hot days. If there is a toilet in the corner of the yard, it is often like the public toilets on the street, without maggots or odors, and the pit opening has a lid. Those who raise chickens have built neat chicken coops; in addition, fences are tied with sorghum stalks to limit the chickens' daytime activities and prevent them from running around and defecating indiscriminately. The chicken coops are cleaned once a day and are very clean. Those who raise pigs keep them in pens. The pens are padded with clean soil, which is changed daily by the housewives or others so that there is no odor at all.

    Here, every home has bright windows and clean tables. The walls, kangs (heated platforms), floors, stoves, and tables, benches, boxes, and cabinets are all spotless. The roofs and beams are also often cleaned. The mouths of the kitchen stoves are covered with iron sheets. The kitchens and bedrooms are separate, so there is no smoky black soil inside the houses. Many families also paint the walls white and bright. Bowls, chopsticks, spoons, and food are covered with gauze or cloth towels. There are porcelain or earthenware jars on the floor to be used as spittoons, and no one spits on the floor. Every home has thermos bottles to prevent people from drinking unboiled water. The windows have screens for air circulation.

    When the peasants get up early in the morning, the first thing they do is wash their faces, brush their teeth (everyone has a toothbrush), and sweep; they clean everything inside and out, then eat and go to the fields. They all take thermos bottles with them to the fields. When they come back from the fields, they all wash their faces, and those who sweat use wet towels to wipe their bodies and remove the smell of sweat. Young men and women also change their clothes when they come back from the fields, just like factory workers. Older people are not very particular about being pretty, but they also clean up their clothes. Everyone's clothes are washed frequently, and there is no dirt on the collars or sleeves. People who come to visit Sun Village will feel embarrassed if their collars are not clean. For epidemic prevention, everyone here has a mask ready. The fingernails are also often cut very clean. Women all have sanitary napkins. Lice and lice eggs cannot be found in the hair of women and children.

    In the livestock farms of the agricultural cooperative's production teams, many livestock have to urinate and defecate every day, but there is no odor. Some visitors held handkerchiefs in their hands, ready to cover their mouths, but later found that this preparation was unnecessary. The livestock troughs are wiped clean immediately after use and covered with straw curtains. The places where the livestock lie are often padded with several inches of fine soil (there cannot be soil clumps). As soon as the livestock leave in the morning, someone immediately cleans the pen and replaces the soil. If the livestock come back to feed at noon, the soil must be replaced immediately in the afternoon after they leave. The manure and soil removed from the pen are placed in specially prepared manure pits with new soil, and the production team members take it away as fertilizer at any time. When the livestock go out and return, the keepers wipe their bodies clean, ensuring there is no soil, and sometimes they have to boil water to wash them.

    People living in Sun Village do not have to worry about flies bothering them when they eat in the summer, whether they are inside the house or in the yard. When young children fall asleep, they do not need to cover their faces with cloth because there will be no flies crawling on them. Every household has fly swatters, but they are actually rarely used. Some people leave leftover watermelon rinds in the yard or on the street, and they can wait for two or three hours without seeing a single fly. At night, there is no need to hang mosquito nets because there are no mosquitoes. Moreover, there is no harassment from fleas, bedbugs, lice, or rats. People who come here to spend the summer may be more comfortable than in some cities. Even the cattle and dogs here are not bitten by gadflies or dog flies. A comrade from the Shanxi Health Department stayed in a hotel in Houma this summer and could not sleep because of mosquito and flea bites. Later, when he visited Sun Village, he exclaimed with great emotion: "The hotel in Houma is not as good as the pen in Sun Village." This is not an exaggeration.

    Practicing hygiene has become a habit for all residents of Sun Village. A staff member came to the village with dysentery and was advised by the villagers to return to the county for treatment. When the influenza epidemic spread this spring, the village implemented "no visiting relatives, no going to market, everyone wears a mask." If someone from another village came, they were politely persuaded to leave and asked to come back after the epidemic had passed. When apricot sellers came to the village in the summer, primary school students saw rotten apricots in his basket. They persuaded him to throw them into the garbage bin and only sell good apricots. There are many such things.

    The Party and the government's concern for the health of the peasants
    Perhaps the residents here have a tradition of hygiene? No. Before 1952, people here, like elsewhere, often did not wash their feet or clothes, excrement was everywhere, and there were as many mosquitoes, flies, fleas, and rats as in other villages. Plagues and epidemics occurred every year, and many people died prematurely from epidemics.

    The reason why the people here have been able to build such civilized and progressive living habits is first and foremost because of their economic liberation. The land reform, especially the agricultural production cooperatives, freed people from the lives of worrying about food and clothing and excessive poverty that they had before. At the same time, the Party and the People's Government of Jishan County also paid special attention to the health of the people. In 1952, they combined the propaganda against germ warfare with large-scale hygiene and epidemic prevention education for the peasants and took many measures to improve rural hygiene and health. After the agricultural cooperation in 1955, they systematically strengthened this work. In addition to the county hospital, there are market town hospitals. Each township has several agricultural cooperatives jointly establishing health clinics, and each natural village has health rooms, midwifery stations, etc., of the agricultural cooperatives. These mass health organizations are responsible for medical treatment, as well as various epidemic prevention measures, hygiene propaganda and education, and leadership inspection. These health organizations are familiar with the health conditions of each village and even the health conditions of each resident. They make a health card for each resident and also register women's menstrual periods and pregnancy dates so that the agricultural cooperative can assign appropriate farm work according to each person's health status, such as pregnant women and breastfeeding women, and women during menstruation, are assigned to work near the village and light work. Doctors from the health organizations go to the villages and cooperatives at any time to inspect, treat, and examine, and they are available at any time for emergencies. These health personnel universally publicize and explain scientific hygiene knowledge to the residents of each village, so that people understand the roots of disease and methods of disease prevention, break superstitions, and break the bad habit of seeking gods instead of seeking medical treatment. The Party and government leadership organs of the county and various systems also actively support and assist in this work, so that it can be effective.

    In Sun Village, hygiene propaganda and education are carried out particularly deeply and meticulously. As early as the early days of the patriotic hygiene movement in 1952, the village used the tragic story of Zhang Yinhe, an old man who sought gods instead of seeking medical treatment and did not pay attention to hygiene, resulting in the deaths of two children from epidemics, as a typical example to educate the masses about hygiene. Later, this story was adapted into a Puju opera and spread widely. In reading groups, civil schools, primary schools, Communist Youth League member classes, and mass meetings, hygiene was promoted everywhere as a way to prevent disease. At the same time, Party members, League members, teachers, students, and health workers were organized to take the lead in demonstration, midwives were organized to help the elderly and widowed clean up, female League members were organized to wash clothes and quilts for bachelors, health competitions were launched between groups, households, and people, good deeds were commended at any time, and everyone was organized to visit and learn from each other, inspected every ten days, and persevered. Any shortcomings in each household are included in the next hygiene convention, which is posted on the door, and then inspected according to the convention to overcome the shortcomings.

    After the cooperation in 1955, the requirements of the "Agricultural Development Program," such as "eliminating the four pests," further encouraged the peasants. That winter, the health station trained more health workers and midwives for each production team; organized three cleaning teams; universally carried out hygiene knowledge education on diet, personal hygiene, indoor and outdoor hygiene, and childcare for housewives; carried out scientific feeding hygiene knowledge education for more than ten keepers; opened regular hygiene classes in primary schools; the village ran night schools for adults on agricultural technology and hygiene science knowledge; formulated family hygiene rules for housewives; and established feeding hygiene systems for keepers. In order to provide the masses with increased scientific knowledge, the health station also borrowed microscopes from the hospital for the masses to see bacteria and insect eggs.

    These many tasks have fundamentally changed the old view of "life and death are destined" among the broad masses. Old women threw Guanyin Bodhisattvas into the river, and they began to pay attention to the hygiene of diet and environment like young people. Anyone who does not pay attention will be persuaded or criticized by others. Now, over the years, practicing hygiene has indeed become a new habit, a new tradition, and a new way of life for the masses here. People who want to discover the shortcomings here can sneak into the village, into the farmhouses, or into the livestock farms at any time, but few people get the opposite impression.

    The concept of the "rural" landscape left over from Chinese history has to be completely changed from here on.

            Economic Calculations
    Is it possible to delay production and labor by doing hygiene work so seriously and meticulously? Absolutely not. Hygiene work takes time, but diseases used to take more of people's time than now, and people's spirits are of course much better when they sleep without mosquito bites. If you are not sick, the attendance rate will of course increase. Regular sweeping will also increase fertilizer. Since 1955, due to the universal implementation of new midwifery methods, pregnancy examinations, and labor protection measures, there have been no more cases of childbirth deaths, miscarriages, or work-related injuries. Plagues and infectious diseases have never occurred. Even when the influenza epidemic and chicken plague spread around the surrounding villages this spring, not a single person or chicken in this village got sick. The attendance rate of agricultural cooperative members here is often 100%. In the past, people lacked knowledge of feeding hygiene, and twelve livestock died in 1953. But since improving feeding in 1955, none of the 170 livestock in the village have been sick or missed work. They are all fat and have shiny fur, and 23 young livestock have also been bred. The hygiene campaign in 1955 increased the amount of fertilizer in the whole village, and in 1956, wheat fields were generally top-dressed two or three times. The average wheat yield per mu in the whole village increased from 120 jin in 1955 to 202 jin. In 1955, 90 households lacked food, and since 1956, every household has had surplus grain. In addition to working conditions and natural conditions, the health of people and livestock and the increase in fertilizer have also played a major role.

    Does this cost a lot of money? No, Jishan County does not spend more money on medical prevention than other counties. The organizational expenses of mass health care come partly from the public welfare funds of agricultural cooperatives, partly from pharmaceutical profits, and partly from the health care fees of 3 to 5 jiao per person per year. Family and personal hygiene is nothing more than a thermos bottle, a spittoon, a fly swatter, sanitary napkins, a little lime or powder soil... All of this does not cost much money. Ordinary cooperative members can afford it, but they simply did not have this habit before.

    The treatment of medical personnel will be evaluated by the masses every year, and their work enthusiasm is very high. They are not worried that they will lose their jobs if there are no patients. On the contrary, the better the hygiene work is done and the fewer the patients, the more income the agricultural cooperative will have, and the better the treatment and life of these medical personnel will be. The absurd phenomenon in the capitalist world where doctors hope there are more patients does not exist here.

　　我们的农民过着文明的生活
　　记山西省的一个卫生模范村——太阳村
    本报记者　林韦
    人们一谈到农村，大概都会联想到食物和碗筷上爬着苍蝇，房里房外和街道上到处垃圾，人畜和家禽的粪便发散着臭味，蚊、蝇、蚤、虱和臭虫咬得睡不着觉……。
    这些好像是很难改变的，因为：第一，农民必须喂养牲口，喂养鸡、鸭、猪，必须弄肥料；第二，农村没有下水道，自来水，生产力和人民收入都不如城市；还可以找出若干别的理由。
    但事实却证明，在共产党领导下的农村，这种状况是完全可以改变的。农民同样可以过文明卫生的生活。山西省稷山县就是一个明显的例子。
    稷山县的农村同一般农村一样，房屋大多数是土坯造成的，屋里屋外和街道上都是土地，农民也喂养牲口喂养鸡、猪，也弄粪，但是现在有一半以上的村庄都非常干净，合于卫生模范村的标准。在这个县里，从城里到城外，从平地到高原，人们很少能遇到肮脏不堪的村庄，这里一般村庄都是整洁和舒畅的。董家庄乡所属的太阳村，更为一切参观者所称道。
      太阳村是这样漂亮讲究
    绕村一周的杨柳树丛林，使人感觉到清爽宜人。村里大街小巷，都是平整而光洁的。街道中间稍高两旁稍低，完全像是城市中的马路。在久旱不雨，附近公路上有了几寸厚的尘土时，村里的道路，仍然光洁如常，因为每天清早都有农业合作社的社员们分段洒扫，还有专门的妇女扫街队负责洒扫三不管的广场、戏台或道口。偶尔有牲口在走过时拉了粪，马上就有人来收拾干净。在十字路口，人们用砖头砌了小小的花坛，种植着各种花卉。街道两旁，隔不多远就有一个公共厕所和砖砌的垃圾箱。厕所普遍有干净的木盖，坑里都洒了苦矾或六六六药粉，或者放了苦树皮苦树根，有的还垫了土，所以即使在盛夏也不会生一条蛆。坑厕附近的土，由生产队定期彻底去旧换新，拿去作了肥料。虫蛹和卵都被挖净，苍蝇也因此不能出生了。垃圾箱上面有盖，旁面有门，每个农户把扫到的垃圾都由上面倒进箱里，生产队的人们就从旁边开门把垃圾挖走，用来肥田。这里的街道，就这样保持了长年的清洁。
    街道两旁的农舍，院墙里外都泥得又光又滑又整齐，墙外面的下半截还用石灰粉得雪白。在农家院里，随便走到哪一家，都是非常光亮整洁的。几乎所有的院落都栽着花，或种了树。院里有干净的石桌，热天农民们就在这石桌上开饭。院角有厕所的，往往像街道上的公共厕所一样，没有蛆虫，没有臭味，坑口有盖。养鸡的，都盖了整齐的鸡窝；另外用高粱秆扎了篱笆，给鸡子的白天活动限定了范围，不许乱跑乱拉。鸡舍每天清理一次，都很干净。养猪的，猪都在圈里。圈里垫着洁净的土，由家庭主妇或其他的人每天换新土，不让它有一点臭气。
    这里，家家都是明窗净几的。墙壁、炕上、地下、锅头和桌凳箱柜，都一尘不染。屋顶和大梁也时常打扫得干干净净。厨房炉灶的口上，都有铁片遮着。厨房和卧室都是分开的，所以屋子里面没有烟熏的黑土，许多人家还把墙粉刷得白亮。碗、筷、匙子和食物，都用纱布或布巾遮盖着。地下都有瓷罐或瓦罐，当痰盂用，没有人在地上吐痰。家家有暖水瓶，防止人们喝生水。窗户上都有纱窗流通空气。
    农民们一清早起来，首先是洗脸、刷牙（人人都有牙刷）、洒扫；把里里外外都搞干净，然后吃饭、上地。上地的时候都带着暖水瓶。上地回来，都要洗脸，身上出汗的要用湿巾擦身体，去除汗味。青年男女从地里回来还要换衣服，像工厂的工人一样。年纪大的人不大讲究漂亮，但是也要把衣服收拾干净。所有居民的衣服都经常洗，连领子、袖子上也没有污垢。去太阳村参观的人如果自己领子不干净，他会感到难为情的。为了防疫，这里每个人都准备有口罩。指甲也经常剪得很干净。女人们都有月经带。在妇女和孩子们的头发里，虱子和虱卵是找不到的。
    在农业合作社的生产队的喂畜场，许多牲畜每天都要大小便，但是没有臭气。有的参观者手里拿着手绢准备捂嘴，但是后来都发现这个准备是不必要的。牲口的食槽，用过马上就有人擦拭干净，用草帘盖上。牲口的卧处，时常垫有好几寸厚的细土（不能有土块）。早晨牲口走了，马上有人出圈换新土。午间牲口如果回来喂，下午牲口走了同样要马上出圈换新土。出圈的粪土，用新土拍在特备的粪坑里，随时由生产队员当肥料弄走。牲口外出和归来，饲养员要把它们的身体扫擦干净，不能有土，有时候还要烧水洗涤。
    在太阳村生活的人，夏季吃饭的时候，不管摆在屋里院里，都不用耽心蝇子来骚扰。小孩子睡着了，也用不着拿布遮脸，因为不会有蝇子来爬他们的。家家户户都有蝇拍，实际上却很少用到它。有的人把吃剩的西瓜皮放在院里或街上，等上两三个钟头等不到一只苍蝇。晚间睡觉，也用不着挂蚊帐，因为没有蚊子。而且跳蚤、臭虫、虱子、老鼠的骚扰也没有。人们来这里过夏，也许比在某些城市还舒服些。甚至这里的牛和狗，也没有牛虻和狗蝇来咬它们。山西卫生厅有一个同志今年夏天在候马住店，蚊子、跳蚤咬得睡不成。后来到太阳村参观时大发感慨说：“候马的店，不如太阳村的圈。”这不是夸张。
    讲卫生在太阳村已经成为所有居民的习惯。有一个工作人员带着痢疾病来村，被村民劝回县里治疗去了。在今春流行性感冒蔓延的时候，这个村实行了“不串亲，不赶集，人人戴口罩”。别村有人来了，就婉言劝走，请他在疫病过去以后再来。夏季卖杏的来村，小学生见他篮子里有烂杏。就劝他扔到垃圾箱里去，只卖好杏，这种事情很多。
    党和政府对农民健康的关怀
    也许这里的居民原来就有讲卫生的传统吧？不。这里在1952年以前，人们也和别处一样，经常不洗脚，不洗衣服，粪便随处都是，蚊、蝇、蚤、鼠也和别的村庄一样多。瘟疫流行病年年不断，不老而死于疫病的人很多。
    这里的人民所以能够建设起现在这样文明进步的生活习惯，首先是因为经济上的翻身。土地改革尤其是农业生产合作化，使人们摆脱了从前愁吃愁穿、过度贫困的生活。同时，稷山县的党和人民政府也特别注意人民的健康，他们在1952年就结合反细菌战的宣传，大规模地对农民进行了卫生防疫教育，采取了许多改进农村卫生和健康状况的措施。1955年农业合作化以后，更系统地加强了这方面的工作。县医院之外有集镇医院，各乡都有几个农业社联合设立的保健站，各自然村都有农业社的保健室、接生站等等。这些群众性的保健机构负责医疗，同时也负责各种预防疫病的措施、卫生方面的宣传教育和领导检查。这些保健机构熟悉各村的卫生状况以至各个居民的健康状况。它们给每个居民做一个健康卡片，同时登记妇女的月经期和怀孕日期，使农业社能按照各人健康状况分配适当的农活，如孕妇与喂奶妇女，经期妇女，分配给近地活和轻活。保健机构的医生随时到各村各社巡视和治疗、检查，有急病随请随到。这些卫生人员向各村居民普遍宣传讲解科学卫生常识，使人们懂得得病的根源和防病的方法，破除迷信，破除求神不求医的恶习。县的党政领导机关和各系统，也都积极支持和协助这方面的工作，使它能够取得成效。
    在太阳村，卫生的宣传教育做得特别深入而细致。远在1952年爱国卫生运动初期，这村就把村民张银和老头求神不求医、不讲卫生，以致两个孩子都死于疫病的悲惨故事作为典型事例来教育群众讲卫生。以后又把这故事编成蒲剧普遍传播。在读报组，民校，小学校，青年团团员课和群众大会上，到处宣传讲卫生可以防疾病。同时组织党、团员和教师、学生、卫生人员带头示范，组织接生员帮孤寡老人打扫，组织女团员给单身汉洗衣被，开展组与组、户与户、人与人的卫生竞赛，随时表扬好的，组织大家互相参观学习，十天一检查，坚持不懈。各户有什么缺点，就订入下次卫生公约，贴在门上，以后按公约检查，克服缺点。
    1955年合作化以后，“农业发展纲要”所提出的“除四害”等要求更鼓舞了农民。这年冬天，保健站为各生产队训练了更多的保健员和接生员；组织了三个清扫队；普遍对家庭妇女进行了关于饮食、个人、室内外和保育等方面的卫生知识教育；对十多个饲养员进行了科学的饲养卫生知识教育；小学里开了定期的卫生课；村里为成年人办了农业技术和卫生科学知识的夜校；在家庭妇女中制定了家庭卫生守则；在饲养员中订饲养卫生制度。为了供群众增长科学知识，保健站还从医院借显微镜来，让群众看细菌，看虫卵。
    这许许多多的工作，使广大群众从根本上改变了“死生有命”的老看法。老太婆把观世音菩萨扔到河里去了，她们开始像青年人一样注意饮食和环境的卫生。谁不注意，就会受到旁人的规劝或批评。现在，年长日久，讲卫生在这里的确已经成了群众的新习惯，新传统，新的生活方式。想要发现这里的缺点的人们，可以随时偷偷地闯进村里，闯进农舍或养畜场，但是很少有人得到相反的印象。
    中国历史上所遗留下来的关于“农村”面貌的概念，从这里起要彻底改变了。
            经济的计算
    把卫生工作做得这样认真而细致，是不是有可能贻误生产劳动呢？决不。卫生工作需要花费时间，但是疾病在从前花费人们的时间不知要超过现在多少，睡觉没有蚊虫咬，人们精神当然好得多。不生病，出勤率当然会增加。经常扫除，肥料也会增加。这个村从1955年到现在，由于普遍实行新法接生，孕期检查和劳动保护办法，过去那些生孩子死人、孕妇流产的现象以至工伤事故，都没有了。瘟疫和传染病也从未发生。就是今年春天流行性感冒和鸡瘟蔓延四周村庄的时候，这个村子也没有一个人一个鸡发病。这里农业社社员的出勤率经常是百分之百。过去人们缺少饲养卫生知识，1953年还死过十二头牲口。但是自从1955年改善饲养以来，全村一百七十头牲口没有一头生病误工，一头头膘肥毛光，还繁殖了二十三头幼畜。1955年的卫生运动使全村肥料增多，1956年麦田普遍追肥二、三次，全村小麦亩产量由1955年的一百二十斤增至二百零二斤。1955年还有九十户缺粮，1956年以来户户有余粮。除了工作条件和自然条件以外，人畜健康和肥料增多也起了重大作用。
    这要不要花费很多的钱呢？也不要，医疗预防方面，稷山县并不比别的县花钱多。群众性的保健的组织费用，一部分来自农业社的公益金，一部分是医药利润，还有群众一人一年三角到五角钱的保健费，家庭和个人卫生，无非是一个暖水瓶，一只痰盂，一把蝇拍，月经带，一点石灰或粉土……。所有这些，都花不了几个钱。普通社员都花得起，只是从前没有这种习惯罢了。
    医疗人员的待遇要由群众逐年评定，他们的工作积极性都很高。他们并不耽心没有了病人自己会失业，相反的，卫生工作搞得越好，病人越少，农业社收入越多，这些医疗人员的待遇和生活也就越好。资本主义世界那种医生希望病人多的荒谬现象，在这里是没有的。
