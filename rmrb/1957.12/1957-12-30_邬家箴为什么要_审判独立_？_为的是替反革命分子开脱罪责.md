Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 28th. All cadres of the Zhejiang Provincial Higher People's Court and the Department of Justice have thoroughly exposed and criticized the anti-Party crimes of Wu Jiazhen, a rightist element within the Party, Deputy President of the Provincial Higher People's Court, and Deputy Secretary of the Party Leadership Group in recent months.

The large amount of facts that have been revealed prove that Wu Jiazhen's anti-Party activities were planned and programmatic. Under the banner of "judicial independence," he opposed the Party's leadership over the People's Courts, claiming that the Party Committee's leadership over the court could only be "principled" leadership on guidelines and policies, and could not interfere in cases that had a direct and significant relationship with the Party's guidelines and policies. If it did interfere, it would be "interfering with the independent trial of the court."

In order to realize his ambition to usurp the province's judicial power, Wu Jiazhen formed an anti-Party alliance with another rightist element within the Party, Liu Gengsheng, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division. They resisted the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, openly scolded the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee, and incited the masses to be dissatisfied with the Party. On the one hand, they clamored to the Provincial Party Committee that "the Provincial Party Committee can authorize the President to be responsible for leading the work of the court on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee," and on the other hand, they tried their best to uglify, embarrass, and squeeze out the President within the court, attempting to force the President to "step down."

Wu Jiazhen attempted to implement a "revolution" in the People's Courts using bourgeois legal concepts. He appointed his confidant, the rightist element Liu Gengsheng, to draft a "Several Provisions on the Division of the Scope of Judicial Work Authority" (draft), proposing that the President and presiding judges of the court were not in a leadership relationship with the collegial panel handling specific cases, and could not approve cases handled by the collegial panel. He touted this reactionary program everywhere as "revolutionary measures" and "the most advanced experience," and vigorously promoted the "superiority" of the President and presiding judges not approving cases.

Wu Jiazhen also viciously attacked the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, and tried his best to exaggerate the general shortcomings and individual errors of the struggle against counter-revolutionaries, openly slandering that opposing right-leaning thought in the 1955 suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement "actually played the role of coercion and command." He advocated that in investigating cases, only "errors must be corrected" should be grasped, and it was not necessary to consider "counter-revolutionaries must be suppressed," clamoring that "the errors of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement cannot be found to the bottom," and accusing the Provincial Party Committee of "not having much enthusiasm" for checking cases. He also forced the leader of the Provincial Court's Five-Person Group for the Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries to make a self-criticism at the Party Leadership Group meeting, accusing him of "not attending to his proper duties."

In order to exonerate counter-revolutionary elements and criminals, Wu Jiazhen often put forward the so-called "presumption of innocence" and "trial favoring the defendant" in handling cases, advocating that no matter what kind of major counter-revolutionary elements or criminals they were, as long as the judgment had not become legally effective, the first consideration in the trial should be from the aspect of "innocence," and they could only be called "defendants," not criminals. In the trial of cases, it was necessary to focus on the favorable side of the "defendant," and find various excuses to exonerate or mitigate the defendant's guilt. He also consistently emphasized that for cases where direct evidence could not be obtained, no matter how complete the indirect evidence was, he expressed suspicion, and openly put forward the slogan of "rather let go by mistake."

Wu Jiazhen also often boasted about the anti-communist ringleader Huang Shaohong, saying that Huang was a "progressive element." He also said, "He understands the law," advocating that there should also be a democratic person like Huang Shaohong in the court's adjudication committee. When Huang Shaohong launched vicious attacks on the Party, Wu Jiazhen applauded and cheered for him, saying that Huang Shaohong's opinions were all "facts." At the same time, he and Song Yunbin, the leader of the Zhejiang rightists, also echoed each other, launching a major offensive against the Party.

It was not accidental that Wu Jiazhen embarked on the road of anti-Party and anti-socialism and became a shameful traitor. As early as the War of Resistance Against Japan, he had a serious sense of personal authority, consistently opposed leadership, and often spread emotions of dissatisfaction with the Party. After liberation, during his tenure as director of the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Department, he openly reached out to the Party for position, treatment, and material enjoyment. In 1955, because Wu Jiazhen had historical problems and was investigated by the organization, he felt that he had suffered a great shame, and he became alienated from the Party and finally degenerated.

### 邬家箴为什么要“审判独立”？  为的是替反革命分子开脱罪责

    邬家箴为什么要“审判独立”？
    为的是替反革命分子开脱罪责
    新华社杭州28日电　浙江省高级人民法院和司法厅的全体干部在最近几个月来，彻底揭发和批判了党内右派分子、省高级人民法院副院长、党组副书记邬家箴的反党罪行。
    已经揭露的大量事实证明：邬家箴的反党活动是有计划、有纲领的。他打着“审判独立”的招牌，反对党对人民法院的领导，说什么党委对法院只能是方针政策上的“原则”领导，不能过问一些和党的方针政策有直接重大关系的案件，过问了就是“干涉法院的独立审判”。
    邬家箴为了实现其篡夺全省审判大权的野心，竟同党内另一右派分子、刑庭庭长刘更生结成反党联盟。他们抗拒省委领导，公开谩骂省委负责同志，煽动群众对党不满。他们一方面向省委叫嚣“省委可以授权院长代表省委负责领导法院工作”，一方面又在法院内部对院长尽量丑化、刁难、排挤，企图赶院长“下台”。
    邬家箴企图用资产阶级法律观点对人民法院实行“革命”。他指定他的亲信——右派分子刘更生起草了一个有关“审判工作职权范围划分的若干规定”（草案），提出法院的院长和庭长对具体办案的合议庭不是领导关系，不能审批合议庭办的案件。他到处吹嘘这个反动纲领是“革命措施”、“最大的先进经验”，并大肆宣扬院、庭长不审批案件的“优越性”。
    邬家箴还恶毒地攻击肃反运动，极力夸大肃反斗争的一般缺点和个别错误，公开污蔑1955年肃反运动中反对右倾思想“实际上起到强迫命令的作用”，他主张查案中只抓“有错必纠”，不必考虑“有反必肃”，叫嚣“肃反运动的错误摸不到底”，指责省委对检查案件工作“劲头不大”。他还在党组会上逼令省法院肃反五人小组组长检讨，指责他“不务正业”。
    邬家箴为了替反革命分子和犯罪分子开脱罪责，经常在办案中提出所谓“无罪推定论”和“审判有利被告论”，主张不论对什么样重大反革命分子或犯罪分子，只要判决没有发生法律效力，在审理时都应首先从“无罪”方面来考虑，只能称之为“被告”，不能当作罪犯，在审判案件时要着重考虑对“被告”有利的一面，找出种种借口为被告开脱或减轻罪责。他还一贯强调对不可能取得直接证据的案件，不管间接证据如何完备，也表示怀疑，公开提出“宁可错放”的口号。
    邬家箴还经常为反共头子黄绍竑吹嘘，说黄是个“进步分子”。还说，“他是懂法的”，主张在法院审判委员会里也要有个像黄绍竑那样的民主人士。当黄绍竑向党进行恶毒攻击时，邬家箴就为之拍手喝采，说黄绍竑的意见都是“事实”。同时他与浙江右派头目宋云彬也互相呼应，大举向党进攻。
    邬家箴走上反党、反社会主义的道路，成为可耻的叛徒不是偶然的。远在抗日战争时期，他就因个人权威思想严重，一贯对抗领导，经常散布对党不满的情绪。解放以后，在浙江省公安厅任处长期间，曾公然向党伸手要地位、要待遇、要物质享受。1955年由于邬家箴有历史问题被组织上审查，他认为受到了莫大耻辱，对党离心离德，终于蜕化变质。
