　　Children's Mouths and Hands
　　Shu Ze
    Adults should always pay attention to the mouths and hands of young children. If a child's mouth and hands are not clean, it can cause many kinds of diseases and even affect the child's overall health.
    There is a Chinese saying, "Illness enters through the mouth." In fact, not only can unhygienic food cause disease, but poor oral hygiene can also cause disease.
    One of the most common dental diseases in five- or six-year-old children is tooth decay, also commonly known as "worm teeth." This dental disease is not caused by teeth being eaten by worms. The cause of tooth decay is damage to the calcium in the teeth. Children's teeth are most vulnerable to calcium damage shortly after baby teeth fall out and permanent teeth grow, so tooth decay is most likely to occur at this time. How is calcium damaged? First, it is due to a lack of calcium and vitamin D in the body; second, it is due to the teeth being frequently stimulated by lactic acid. In order to prevent a lack of calcium and vitamin D in the body, attention should be paid to giving children foods rich in calcium (such as milk, soy milk, eggs, bone broth, etc.). Ultraviolet rays can enable the body to produce vitamin D, so it is especially important to get plenty of sunshine. In order to avoid stimulating the teeth with lactic acid, attention must be paid to oral hygiene. Food residue that remains in the teeth for a long time will be broken down by bacteria into lactic acid, which will slowly damage the teeth. Sugar is most easily broken down into lactic acid, so children who eat too much sugar are prone to tooth decay.
    When tooth enamel is damaged, it initially loses its luster and the teeth become rough; as the damage goes deeper, cavities form. When there is a hole in the tooth, the nerve is exposed, and toothache will be felt whenever eating something too cold, too hot, or sour. If the damage goes deeper and the cavity penetrates to the pulp, it will cause pulpitis. In addition, unclean teeth can also cause gingivitis (gum) with pus. Gingival abscesses and pulpitis are both very unpleasant diseases, not only causing tooth problems, but also causing diseases in other parts of the body because the bacteria's toxins are absorbed by the blood. Dental diseases can also directly affect the respiratory and digestive tracts, causing bronchitis and gastritis.
    How to keep teeth clean? The most important methods are brushing teeth and gargling. Children can start brushing their teeth at the age of five. At first, children cannot brush by themselves, and parents can help them brush. It is best to brush twice a day, once in the morning and once before going to bed at night. It is not necessary to use toothpaste when brushing teeth; refined edible salt can also be used. The method of brushing teeth is very important. In order to brush away the residue in the teeth, it is not useful to brush the teeth horizontally. When brushing the upper teeth, brush from top to bottom, and when brushing the lower teeth, brush from bottom to top. The inside and occlusal surfaces of the teeth should also be brushed. This brushing method does not take much time and can brush the teeth very clean.
    The cleanliness of the toothbrush itself is also very important. If children throw their toothbrushes around and make them very dirty, they may easily bring dirty things into their mouths when brushing their teeth, causing oral inflammation or dental diseases. After each use of the toothbrush, the bristle end should be placed upwards in the mouthwash cup. Never place the bristle end downwards. Because if the bristle end is downwards and placed in the mouthwash cup, ventilation is poor, and the wet bristles are not easy to dry, which can easily breed bacteria. All of these should be noted.
    In order to prevent food residue from remaining in the mouth, children should also be educated to chew more when eating. This will allow saliva to be fully secreted, which will rinse the mouth. At the same time, drinking some soup or water after meals can also help clean the mouth.
    Now, let's talk about children's hands.
    As everyone knows, intestinal parasitic diseases are a common disease in children. The most common is ascariasis. Children with ascariasis not only have stomachaches, but also can cause anemia and malnutrition. How is ascariasis contracted? It is because they eat ascaris eggs. The vegetables we usually eat often have ascaris eggs on them. If the vegetables are not washed cleanly and cooked thoroughly, the ascaris eggs are not killed, and people can get ascariasis if they eat them. Therefore, attention should be paid to not letting children eat raw vegetables. But children's hands can also spread ascariasis.
    Children like to play with dirt. If the nails are long and not cut, dirt will be hidden in the nail seams. If we randomly pick up a piece of dirt from the street and send it to the laboratory for examination, it is easy to find ascaris eggs. It is conceivable that if children grab dirt with their hands and then use their dirty hands to pick up things to eat, they may eat ascaris eggs into their stomachs.
    We mentioned ascariasis only as an example. In fact, there are many similar examples. Enterobiasis is also a common disease in children. This disease is also related to children's hands. Children's hands can not only bring pinworm eggs from the outside into their mouths, but also bring the eggs excreted by pinworms from their intestines back into their mouths. Children's unclean hands can also transmit enteritis and dysentery. In short, all diseases related to diet are also related to unclean hands.
    In this regard, adults should help children do two things. The first thing is to urge children to wash their hands before eating, so that children develop this habit. The second thing is to often check children's fingernails, and if the nails are long, cut them short for them.
    "Brush your teeth in the morning and evening, wash your hands before meals, trim your nails often, and don't put dirty things in your mouth." Adults should always remember these words and pay attention to children's mouths and hands, which is of great benefit to children's health.

### 孩子的口和手

　　孩子的口和手
　　书泽
    大人应该经常注意小孩子的一张口和两只手。如果小孩子的口腔和手不干净，就会引起很多种疾病，甚至会影响小孩子整个身体的健康。
    中国有句俗话，“病从口入”。其实，不仅饮食不合卫生要求可以引起疾病，口腔保护不好也能引起疾病。
    五、六岁的孩子最容易得的一种牙病，叫做龋齿，普通也叫做“虫牙”。这种牙病不是因为牙齿被什么虫子吃坏了引起的。龋齿的原因是牙齿的钙质受到损害。小孩子在乳齿脱落、恒齿才生出来以后不久，牙齿的钙质最容易受到损害，所以这时候也最容易发生龋齿。钙质怎样会受到损害呢？第一，是身体内钙质和维生素丁的不足；第二是牙齿经常受到乳酸的刺激。为了防止体内钙和维生素丁的缺少，应该注意给小孩子吃些富于钙质的食物（如牛乳，豆浆，蛋类，用骨头熬汤等）。紫外线可以使身体产生维生素丁，所以多接近阳光也特别重要。为了避免牙齿受到乳酸的刺激，那就要注意口腔的清洁。食物的残渣长久存在牙缝里，会被细菌分解成为乳酸，使牙质慢慢变坏。糖最容易分解成为乳酸，所以小孩子吃糖太多，容易发生龋齿。
    牙质受到破坏，最初是失去了光泽，牙变得粗糙了；再向深处破坏，就成为空洞。牙齿有洞，神经露在外面，每当吃了太冷、太热的东西，或者酸的东西，会感到牙痛。如果再向深处破坏，牙洞穿通到牙髓，会引起牙髓发炎。此外，牙齿不清洁还可以引起齿龈（牙肉）发炎蓄脓。齿龈蓄脓和牙髓发炎都是很讨厌的疾病，不仅牙齿发生障碍，而且由于细菌的毒素被血液吸收，可以引起身体其他部分的疾病。牙齿有病还可以直接影响到呼吸道和消化道，引起气管支炎和胃炎。
    怎样保持牙齿的清洁呢？最主要的办法是刷牙和漱口。小孩子到了五岁，可以开始刷牙。起先，小孩子自己不会刷，父母可以帮助他刷。最好每天刷两次，早晨一次，晚间睡觉以前一次。刷牙不一定要用牙膏，用精制的食盐也可以。刷牙的方法非常重要。为了把牙缝里的残渣刷掉，用牙刷横着刷是没有什么用处的。刷上牙的时候应该从上往下刷，刷下牙的时候应该从下往上刷，牙齿的内侧和交合面，也要刷一刷。这样的刷法并不费时间，而且可以把牙刷得很干净。
    牙刷本身的清洁也很要紧，小孩子如果把牙刷到处乱丢，弄得很脏，刷牙的时候反而容易把脏东西带到口腔里面，引起口腔发炎，或者牙齿生病。牙刷每次用过之后，应该把有毛刷的一头朝上，放在漱口杯里，千万不要把有毛刷的一头朝下。因为，有毛刷的一头如果朝下，放在漱口杯里，通风不畅，湿的毛刷不容易干，就容易滋生细菌。这些，都应该注意。
    为了使食物残渣不致存在口内，还应该教育小孩子吃饭要多多咀嚼。这样才能使唾液充分分泌，对口腔起到冲洗的作用。同时，饭后喝点汤或者水，也可以帮助清洁口腔。
    现在，再谈谈小孩子的两只手。
    大家都知道，肠子的寄生虫病，是小孩子很容易得的一种病。最多见的是蛔虫病。小孩子有了蛔虫病，不光肚子痛，还会引起贫血和营养不良。蛔虫病是怎么得的呢？是因为吃了蛔虫卵。平常我们吃的蔬菜上面，常常有蛔虫卵，如果蔬菜洗得不干净，煮得不透，蛔虫卵没有煮死，人吃了就能得蛔虫病。所以应该注意不要让孩子吃生菜。可是小孩子的两只手也能传播蛔虫病。
    小孩子是喜欢玩泥土的。如果指甲长了没有剪，指甲缝里就会藏着泥土。假如我们把街上的泥土，随便拣来一块，送到化验室，检查一下，那是很容易发现蛔虫卵的。可想而知，小孩子用手抓了泥土，再用脏手拿东西吃，就可能把蛔虫卵吃到肚子里去。
    我们提到蛔虫病，不过是举了一个例子。同样的例子，其实还有很多。蛲虫病也是小孩子容易得的一种病。这种病也和小孩子的两只手有关系。小孩子的两只手不仅可以把外面的蛲虫卵带到自己口里去，而且可以把自己肠子里蛲虫排出的卵，重新带到口里去。小孩子的手不清洁还能传染肠炎和痢疾。总而言之，一切和饮食有关系的疾病，也都和手的不清洁有关系。
    在这方面，大人应该帮助孩子做两件事。第一件事：是督促小孩子在吃东西以前一定要洗手，使小孩子养成这种习惯。第二件事是常常检查小孩子的手指甲，如果指甲长了，就要替他剪短。
    “早晚要刷牙，饭前要洗手，指甲经常剪，脏东西不入口。”大人要经常记住这几句话，经常注意小孩子的口和手，对于小孩子的健康是有很大好处的。
