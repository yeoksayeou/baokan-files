    Talking about "Red and Expert"
    Li Zi
    In the discussion of "Red" and "Expert," the meaning of "Red" should first be clarified. What is "Red"? Comrade Liu Shaoqi clearly told us in his "Speech at the Meeting of All Circles in Beijing Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution": "Our state workers and various experts should be determined to transform themselves, wholeheartedly serve the workers and peasants, serve socialism, and put personal interests within the collective interests of the masses, rather than above the collective interests of the masses. This is what it means to be a Red expert." Does being both Red and expert mean that every expert must simultaneously be a political activist or a political theorist? No. It is difficult for an expert to be simultaneously a political activist or a political theorist, and only a very few people can meet that requirement. The "Red" we are talking about today is to solve the problem of whom to serve.
    Is it possible not to serve anyone? Some say they are "nobly" doing science for the sake of science. This statement itself is unscientific. What is it to say that a scientist gives what he researches to science? If Watt's steam engine were only kept on a high shelf and not used for science and not allowed to be used by the people, would that be possible? In the past, anything a scientist researched was either given to capitalists for patenting (of course, he himself would gain fame and fortune) or to serve the people. The absurd theory of "science for the sake of science" was concocted by the bourgeoisie to deceive people. The purpose of this slogan is to separate experts from the masses. After the experts are separated from the masses, they can use fame and fortune to buy them off and make them serve them. "Science for the sake of science" is a deceptive slogan used by capitalists to make experts serve capitalists through the experts' personal fame and fortune. Today, what prevents some experts from accepting the slogan of "both Red and expert" is the bourgeois ideology of personal fame and fortune.
    Some say "Red" is good, but it takes too much time, and "Red" will affect "Expert." This view that puts Red and Expert in opposition is an isolated and one-sided way of looking at the problem. To transform oneself into a Red expert, it is inevitable to attend more meetings and read more documents in the initial stage of the transformation. In the short term, this may take some time and affect the amount of time spent reading professional books. However, as long as one has the determination to serve the people, what follows is the improvement of our working methods and thinking methods. A person who wholeheartedly serves the people, under the guidance of dialectical materialism, studies diligently and practically, and will achieve more and faster achievements in science. At the same time, watching the construction undertakings of 600 million people leaping forward at high speed, the people encourage us and support us, and we will have infinite confidence and determination to move forward. Red does not hinder expert. Putting Red and Expert in opposition is caused by looking at the problem in an isolated and one-sided way. On the contrary, Red is of great help to Expert.
    Is it excessive to ask experts to have a stand of serving the people? The people have the right to ask the experts to clarify this issue. Whoever is unwilling to be determined to transform themselves, abandon the bourgeois ideology of personal fame and fortune, and become an expert serving the people, the people will also be determined not to want this expert. The 600 million people must not spend money for a long time to support some experts who work for "personal interest," "science for the sake of science," and "science for personal fame and fortune." The theories of "expert first, then red" and "division of labor between red and expert" are, in the final analysis, nothing more than various pretexts for not being determined to transform oneself into an expert serving the people.
    The motherland is advancing. We believe that after this great debate between Red and Expert, more experts will emerge to serve the people of the motherland and the construction undertakings of the motherland with the spirit of "willing to be an ox for the children."

### 谈谈“红与专”

    谈谈“红与专”
    李梓
    在“红”与“专”的讨论中，首先应该明确“红”的意义。什么是“红”？刘少奇同志“在北京各界庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年大会上的讲话”中明确地告诉我们说：“我们的国家工作人员和各种专家都应当下定决心改造自己，全心全意为工人农民服务，为社会主义服务，把个人利益放在大众的集体利益之中，而不是放在大众的集体利益之上，这就是红色专家”。又红又专是不是说要每一个专家同时是政治活动家或政治理论家呢？不是的。要一个专家同时又是一个政治活动家或政治理论家，那是困难的，只有极少数的人可以达到那样的要求。今天所说的“红”，就是解决为谁服务的问题。
    有没有可能不为任何人服务？有人说他是“高尚地”为科学而科学。这句话本身就不科学。一个科学家把自己研究出来的东西交给科学。这是什么话？如果瓦特的蒸气机只束诸高阁不为科学服务，不许人民使用，那可能吗？过去一个科学家研究出来的任何东西，不是交给资本家去专利（当然自己也就有了名有了利）就是去为人民服务。“为科学而科学”这种怪论，是资产阶级编造出来骗人的。这个口号的目的在于使专家们脱离群众，在专家们脱离群众以后，他们就可以用名利把专家收买起来为他们服务。“为科学而科学”是资本家通过专家们的个人名利来使专家为资本家服务的骗人口号。在今天，阻碍某些专家接受“又红又专”的口号的是资产阶级个人名利思想。
    有人说“红”很好，但是太费时间，“红”会影响到“专”。这种把红与专对立起来的看法，是孤立的片面的看问题的方法。改造成为一个红色专家，在改造的初期，不可避免地要多参加一些会议，多阅读一些文件。这样在眼前来说，也许是花了一些时间，影响到更多看一些专业书籍。但是，只要自己有了为人民服务的决心，随之而来的是我们的工作方法，思想方法上的改进。一个全心全意为人民服务的人，在辩证唯物主义思想的指导下，联系实际、艰苦钻研，在科学上他将更多更快地取得成就。同时，眼看着六亿人民的建设事业在飞速跃进，人民鼓舞着我们，支持我们，我们也就会有无限信心和决心，努力前进。红并不妨碍专。把红与专对立起来，那是孤立地片面地看问题的方法造成的。恰恰相反，红对专是有很大帮助的。
    要求专家们有为人民服务的立场，这难道是过分的吗？人民有权利要求专家们把这个问题明确起来。谁不愿意下决心改造自己，放弃资产阶级个人名利思想，成为为人民服务的专家，人民也就下决心不要他这个专家。六亿人民决不能长期地花钱来养活一些为“个人兴趣”、“为科学而科学”、“为个人名利而科学”的专家。什么“先专后红”论、“红专分工”论，归根结蒂，不过是没有决心改造自己成为为人民服务的专家的各种托词而已。
    祖国在前进。我们相信经过这一场红与专的大辩论，将会出现更多的专家以“俯首甘为孺子牛”的精神来为祖国的人民，祖国的建设事业服务。
