    What are the Problems in Rural Production and Rectification?

    Currently, a winter production upsurge has been universally launched in the vast rural areas of our country, and the work of Party rectification and commune rectification is also being carried out in many areas. This newspaper published an editorial on December 4 entitled "Promote Production and Rectification Simultaneously," which discussed these two aspects. Now we urgently need to understand the situation in these two areas. For example, what is the ideological state of cadres and the masses during the production upsurge? What new manifestations are there of right-leaning conservative thought? How does it affect current production? Is the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations good? Is there a phenomenon of abandoning sideline occupations? In terms of Party rectification and commune rectification, what major issues have the members of the commune raised during the "blooming and contending"? What are their urgent demands? We hope to receive reports reflecting these aspects in various forms of reporting. In addition to this, we also hope to obtain various reports reflecting the rich and colorful new life in the countryside from various aspects.　　Editor

    农村生产、整社中有些什么问题？
    目前，我国广大农村普遍地掀起了冬季生产高潮，整党整社工作也在不少地区展开。本报12月4日曾发表了“生产整社两不误”的社论，谈到这两方面的问题。现在我们很需要了解这两方面的情况。比如，在生产高潮中，干部和群众的思想状况如何？右倾保守思想有哪些新的表现？对当前的生产影响如何？农副业的结合好不好？是否有丢掉副业的现象？在整党整社方面，社员群众鸣放中提出些什么重大问题？有什么迫切要求？等等。这些，都希望能用各种报道形式反映给我们。除此以外，我们还希望得到从多方面反映农村丰富多采的新生活的各种报道。　　编者
