County Party Secretary - Farm Implement Expert

Since the beginning of autumn this year, Jinping County, Sichuan Province, has experienced a long period of sunny weather with no rain, making the soil hard and dry. It has been difficult to complete the autumn ploughing tasks using old ploughs. Double-wheeled, double-furrow ploughs were available, but farmers did not know how to use them and had put them away as "scrap."

Comrade Wu Zhenjiang, Secretary of the Jinping County Party Committee, learned about this situation and personally went to Dunzai Township to learn how to use the double-wheeled, double-furrow plough. After learning, he opened a farm implement expert training class there and personally taught fifty-nine farm implement experts from various townships and communes. The farm implement experts from various communes went from being unfamiliar with the double-wheeled, double-furrow ploughs to being proficient, and they were able to plough more than twenty dan of land per day, increasing efficiency by two to three times compared to using old ploughs, which greatly promoted the progress of autumn ploughing. Leaders of rural work greatly need to have the spirit of Comrade Wu Zhenjiang: grasping the important links in production and personally taking the lead in doing it. In this way, production will definitely be improved.

    县委书记——农具手
    今年入秋以后，四川省锦屏县久晴无雨，田土干硬，用旧犁耕作很难完成秋耕任务。这里双轮双铧犁是有的，因为农民不会用，当作“废品”放起来了。
    中共锦屏县委书记吴振江同志知道了这个情况，就亲自到敦在乡去学习使用双轮双铧犁。学会了，就在那里开了个农具手训练班，亲手把各乡社的五十九个农具手都教会了。各社的农具手使用双轮双铧犁由不熟到熟练，每天能犁二十多担田，比使用旧犁的效率提高了二至三倍，大大推进了秋耕的进度。农村工作的领导者，很需要有吴振江同志这样的精神：抓住生产的重要环节，亲自带头干起来。这样，生产就一定能搞好。
