    Remembering the Lessons, But Not Losing Confidence
    ——On the Prevention and Control of Swine Fever
  　Zhao Qi
    Swine fever generally prevails in winter and spring. For most areas, now is the season of its spread. It is one of the most serious infectious diseases of pigs. Without preventing and eradicating this epidemic, it will be difficult to develop hog production. This year, Meishan County in Sichuan Province paid attention to this problem early on and organized three epidemic prevention teams to go to Xiang'er Township, where swine fever was severe last winter, to carry out swine fever prevention work, vaccinating 80% of the pigs in the township. This is very necessary.
    Swine fever has always been a major enemy of the pig farming industry. This spring, several provinces lost one million pigs due to its prevalence. We must not forget this lesson. Of course, remembering this lesson does not mean that we should not raise more pigs. It is wrong to generate any negative emotions from this lesson. From what we see now, most areas do not have negative emotions, and the enthusiasm for developing hog production is high everywhere. Many areas have made great efforts in breeding piglets, collecting feed, repairing pens, and accumulating manure. This is a prosperous atmosphere. But we must not forget another important task: preventing swine fever. Some farmers are still unwilling to raise more pigs precisely because they were scared by the past swine fever outbreaks. Only by doing a good job in epidemic prevention can we eliminate this "fear" and raise more pigs. And only by doing a good job in epidemic prevention can the increase in the number of pigs raised be reliable.
    We must not let the mention of swine fever "dampen" the enthusiasm for developing pig farming. We must have the determination and confidence: set a deadline, take action, and eliminate this major enemy!

    不忘教训，也不失信心
　　——谈防治猪疫
  　赵起
    猪瘟一般在冬春流行，就多数地区说，现在正是蔓延的季节。它是猪传染病当中危害最严重的一种病。不防治和扑灭这种疫病，生猪生产就很难发展。四川省眉山县今年及早注意了这个问题，组织了三个防疫组到去年冬季猪瘟流行严重的象耳乡进行猪瘟预防工作，把全乡80％的猪都注射了防疫针。这样做很有必要。
    猪疫历来是养猪业的大敌，今年春天有几个省就因为它的流行而死了一百万头猪。这个教训，我们不能忘记。当然，不忘记这个教训，决不是说不要再多养猪了。从这教训中产生任何消极情绪都是不对的。现在看来，大部分地区并没有消极情绪，各地发展生猪生产的劲头很大。不少地区在繁殖小猪、搜集饲料、修圈积肥等方面都作了很大的努力。这是兴旺气象。但是不能忘记另一件重要工作：预防猪疫。有些农民现在仍然不愿多养猪，正是因为让过去的猪瘟吓怕了。做好防疫工作，才能消除这种“怕”的心理，更多养猪。也只有做好防疫工作，养猪头数的增长才是可靠的。
    千万不可一提起猪瘟来，发展养猪事业的热情就“冷了半截”。要有这样的决心和信心：定出期限来，行动起来，消灭这个大敌！
