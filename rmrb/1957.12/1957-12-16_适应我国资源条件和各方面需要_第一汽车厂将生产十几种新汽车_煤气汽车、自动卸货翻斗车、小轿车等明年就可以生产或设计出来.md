To Adapt to China's Resource Conditions and Various Needs

First Automobile Works Will Produce More Than Ten New Cars

Gas-powered cars, automatic unloading dump trucks, and sedans can be produced or designed next year

(Our Newspaper's dispatch) Reporter Chen Ji reports: The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant recently formulated a plan to produce more than ten new types of automobiles and modified automobiles in the next five years, striving to transform the First Automobile Works from a single-product automobile manufacturer into a multi-product automobile manufacturer as soon as possible.

The plan of the First Automobile Works is proposed according to China's current resource conditions and the diverse needs of China's transportation. Since China's current gasoline production is insufficient, it is very necessary to use gas as the power for automobiles. Gas is not only easy to supply but also cheap; in the past, some areas used gas-powered cars, and the results were good. The First Automobile Works plans to produce several different types of gas-powered cars in the next five years. A gas-powered car that will be launched next year will use the F-type combustion chamber engine successfully tested by the Automobile and Tractor Research Institute, with a gas generator attached. In the future, it will also produce a car that can use bituminous coal, anthracite, charcoal, coke, etc., as fuel. This car can also be driven by gasoline. In addition, it is also planned to design a gas-powered car with a special gas storage tank, which can use natural gas as power.

According to China's different requirements in various aspects, the First Automobile Works plans to produce some multi-purpose automobiles. For example, three-axle off-road vehicles, automatic unloading dump trucks, and tractors that can tow huge equipment. These three types of vehicles can be produced next year. The First Automobile Works also plans to produce more chassis and engines for other factories to modify into various types of buses.

The sedan that the First Automobile Works will design next year is a sedan with four cylinders, six seats, and a generous appearance. This sedan drives fast, saves fuel, and is very stable. In the future, this sedan can also be modified into ambulances and touring cars. In addition, this factory also plans to use existing diesel engines to assemble automobiles.

Producing multi-variety automobiles is a sign of the First Automobile Works' development to a new stage. The First Automobile Works has been officially put into production for only a little over a year, but under the leadership of the Party and with the help of Soviet experts, it quickly mastered the production technology of the Liberation brand automobile and also explored some experience in designing new automobiles. This year, it designed an improved version of the Liberation brand automobile. In order to use domestic steel as much as possible, some product designs have also been effectively modified. These tasks are a good exercise for all factory workers. Recently, the Party Committee of the First Automobile Works convened a mobilization meeting, requiring all factory workers to take immediate action, give full play to the existing equipment capacity of the entire factory, promote enthusiasm and creativity, and strive to complete this glorious and arduous task with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    适应我国资源条件和各方面需要
    第一汽车厂将生产十几种新汽车
    煤气汽车、自动卸货翻斗车、小轿车等明年就可以生产或设计出来
    本报讯　记者陈迹报道：第一汽车制造厂最近制定了今后五年内生产十几种新型汽车和变形汽车的规划，争取提早把第一汽车厂由一个单一品种的汽车制造厂改造成为一个多品种的汽车制造厂。
    第一汽车厂的这个规划，是根据我国目前的资源条件和我国交通运输多方面的需要提出的。由于我国目前汽油生产不足，利用煤气作为汽车的动力就十分必要。煤气不但供应不困难，而且便宜；过去有些地区使用过煤气汽车，效果也不错。第一汽车厂准备在五年内生产好几种不同类型的煤气汽车。明年即可问世的一种煤气汽车，采用汽车拖拉机研究所试验成功的F型燃烧室发动机，附有煤气发生装置。今后还要生产一种能够以烟煤、无烟煤、木炭、焦炭等作为燃料的汽车，这种汽车也可以用汽油开动。另外还准备设计一种带有特殊的储气罐的煤气汽车，这种汽车能够利用天然煤气作为动力。
    根据我国各方面不同的要求，第一汽车厂计划生产一些具有多种用途的汽车。例如三轴越野汽车，能够自动卸货的翻斗车，能够牵引巨大设备的牵引车。这三种车明年就可以生产出来。第一汽车厂还准备多生产些底盘、发动机，供其他工厂改装成各种各样的公共汽车。
    第一汽车厂明年就要设计出来的小轿车，是一种有四个汽缸、六个座位、外貌大方的小轿车。这种小轿车行驶起来很快，不费油，又很平稳。将来利用这种小轿车，还可以改装成救护车、旅行车。此外，这个厂还打算采用现成的柴油发动机来装配汽车。
    生产多品种汽车，是第一汽车厂发展到一个新阶段的标志。第一汽车厂正式投入生产只有一年多的时间，但是在党的领导下，在苏联专家的帮助下，很快掌握了解放牌汽车的生产技术，同时也摸索到一些设计新汽车的经验。今年曾经设计出一种解放牌改进型的汽车。为了尽量采用国产钢材，也有成效地修改了一些产品设计。这些工作对于全厂职工是个很好的锻炼。最近，中共第一汽车厂党委会召开了动员大会，要求全厂职工立即行动起来，充分发挥全厂现有设备能力，发扬积极性和创造性，争取又多又快又好又省地完成这一光荣而艰巨的任务。
