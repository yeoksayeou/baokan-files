　　The Power and Determination of the Working Class
　　— On the Opening of the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions
　　By Our Correspondent Fan Rongkang
    The Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions has opened.
    Only a little more than four years have passed between the Seventh and Eighth National Congresses of Chinese Trade Unions. Four years is merely a brief instant in human history, and not a very long period in the history of the Chinese workers' movement. But how profound have been the changes our country has undergone in these short four years! Four years ago, the victory of the socialist revolution was still a distant prospect of struggle; today, the socialist revolution has not only achieved basic victory economically, but also, after the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts has also achieved a decisive victory. The history of class exploitation in our country for thousands of years has been basically ended by our generation. The socialist system that our people have dreamed of, bled, and sacrificed for for so many years has been basically established. Four years ago, we had just embarked on the construction road of the First Five-Year Plan; today, the First Five-Year Plan has been completed and overfulfilled, thousands of new factories have been put into production, we have our own airplanes, automobiles, ships, locomotives, and various machine tools, and all sectors of the national economy have undergone tremendous development. Now, the larger-scale Second Five-Year Plan is summoning us to advance towards new heights. A powerful socialist China with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture is growing day and night through our arduous labor. How profound have been the changes in the world situation in these short four years! Human history has entered a new turning point favorable to socialism. "The East Wind prevails over the West Wind," and the strength of socialism and the forces striving for peace, democracy, and national liberation have clearly surpassed the strength of the imperialist aggressive camp. Humanity is advancing towards a bright future.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the great vanguard of the Chinese working class, the Chinese trade unions have made significant contributions to building our country into a prosperous and strong socialist nation. Our trade union is now a powerful organization with more than 16.3 million members. Within its 157,000-plus grassroots organizations, 100,000-plus various working committees, and 1.41 million trade union groups, there are 3.89 million activists, leading the broad masses of workers and staff in striving to complete the national plan. Over the past four years, the tide of socialist emulation has swept the country. Among the vast number of workers and staff, 2.6 million advanced producers have emerged, putting forward 4.56 million rationalization proposals. Right here in this venue, among the more than 1,000 official delegates and alternate delegates, there are many outstanding organizers of socialist emulation, sowers of advanced ideas and advanced experiences. Look! Isn't that Wei Wenfeng, the Party Secretary of the Shenyang Smelting Plant? A few years ago, when he took over the Shenyang Smelting Plant from the Kuomintang, how many difficulties did he encounter! The entire plant couldn't find a smelting expert. The only one called a "copper smelting expert," Chen Lian'gao, had only taken the opportunity of transporting ore to peep at some sporadic operations of Japanese workers in the smelting furnace room. Under Chen Lian'gao's command, the first trial smelting failed, and the second trial smelting also failed. This loyal old worker broke down and cried beside the smelting furnace. Today, this factory, which could only produce crude copper of little industrial use when it was operated by the Japanese, is now producing a large amount of electrolytic copper with international standards, and the increase in production is incomparable. In these earth-shaking changes in the Shenyang Smelting Plant, the trade union correctly implemented the Party's policies and played a significant role in all aspects of the enterprise's work and the lives of the workers. After the annual plan is issued, the Party mobilizes the masses to discuss it through the trade union, tapping potential, and the plan targets are usually raised. In the process of implementing the plan, the Party organizes competitions through the trade union, summarizes and promotes advanced experiences, and a large number of advanced producers usually emerge. Wei Wenfeng said: "These have become the rules of enterprise life." Yes, which enterprise's life isn't this boiling? In Shanghai, the new production records that appeared last year, each higher than the last, have not yet faded from people's memories. Today, third-grade youth worker Song Wanqing surpasses cutting expert Sheng Li; tomorrow, Sheng Li throws Song Wanqing's new record behind him again. Today, young female worker Pu Yuzhen surpasses the famous labor model Huang Baomei; tomorrow, Huang Baomei walks ahead of Pu Yuzhen again. In this never-ending tide of competition, as newspapers and radio stations constantly report these daily refreshed new records, how many people are rising up to catch up! Our production, our construction cause, relies on the leadership of the Party, on the trade union's many specific and meticulous ideological work and organizational work, and on the vast number of workers and staff's production enthusiasm and creativity, advancing step by step.
    Right here in this venue, among the more than 1,000 official delegates and alternate delegates, there are also many activists in production and trade union work who emerged during the labor competitions of the First Five-Year Plan. Look! Isn't that Bao Qiying, the saleswoman of the Manzhouli City Department Store, a first-class labor model? This Mongolian girl is only eighteen years old this year. Five years ago, when our country just started implementing the First Five-Year Plan, Bao Qiying was still a little girl. But today, people have elected her to attend the workers' class congress. She is the new blood of the working class. Li Shuzhen, a textile worker and trade union group leader from Tianjin No. 1 State-owned Cotton Mill, a representative from Tianjin, although she has been working for more than ten years, is still only a twenty-five-year-old young person. She is not tall and wears glasses. At first glance, she looks like a female student, an ordinary good daughter of a mother. Who knows how much this ordinary trade union group leader has worried and worked to improve production and promote the unity of the group? A female worker named Zhang Yaochun was a new worker who liked to play, loved to dance, had a big temper, and no one could control her. Li Shuzhen was not bothered, she repeatedly talked to her, and was not discouraged when she was rebuffed. Zhang Yaochun had no place to live, so she let her live in her own home and talked deeply every night. Zhang Yaochun finally made progress and became an activist in the trade union and the leader of the Communist Youth League group. A female worker with the same name and surname as Li Shuzhen, everyone called her Little Li Shuzhen, always dozed off during production, failed to complete the plan every month, and did not participate in collective life such as political study. Li Shuzhen knew that Little Li Shuzhen's backwardness was caused by family discord and heavy housework. She and the activists of her group repeatedly talked to Little Li Shuzhen and Little Li Shuzhen's husband and mother-in-law, helping them to improve their family relations. On Sunday, more than a dozen trade union members paid for soap, needles, and thread out of their own pockets, divided into groups, and went to Little Li Shuzhen's home together, rolled up their sleeves and washed the quilts in Little Li Shuzhen's home and wiped the windows clean. Who has ever seen such an enthusiastic person! Little Li Shuzhen's family has been harmonious since then, and Little Li Shuzhen herself has actively strived to make progress and later became an advanced producer. In August last year, the production quality of the group suddenly declined. Why? Li Shuzhen found that the girls were getting older year by year, and from some time on, a gust of "dating" had blown. In the workshop and dormitory, several people often crowded together to talk privately: "Do you have one?"
  "How's yours going?" Love concerns the happiness of everyone, and the trade union cannot stand idly by. Thus, an enthusiastic but somewhat shy forum began. There were introductions to the experience of finding a partner: what kind of partner should workers choose? There were introductions to the experience of arranging life after marriage: how to take care of children without affecting production? There were also narrations of their ideals, hoping that others would introduce them to partners. Problems discussed privately were also brought to the meeting. They understood each other more deeply and were more united. Li Shuzhen's group is only one of the 1.41 million trade union groups in our country. People live in these warm groups, constantly carrying out self-education, urging themselves to contribute greater strength to the country's construction cause.
    The source of the strength of the Chinese trade unions, the source of the strength of the Chinese working class, is due to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. When Comrade Mao Zedong and other responsible comrades of the CPC Central Committee and the Central People's Government stepped onto the rostrum, the entire venue stood up, and cheers thundered, with applause lasting for a long time. Chairman Mao stood in the middle of the rostrum, initially applauding with everyone, and then waving his hands, asking everyone to sit down. But everyone couldn't sit down. People's eyes were fixed on the rostrum, their hearts flew to the rostrum, and applause sent up to the rostrum. Unable to stop, Chairman Mao applauded with everyone again. At this time, the eyes of many people gleamed with excited tears. The minds of more than a thousand people resonated with one thought: Dear Chairman Mao! Dear Communist Party! We, the sons and daughters of the working class, stand before you. It is you who led us, after a long period of revolutionary struggle, to establish the People's Republic of China. It is you who led us, after all the hardships, to achieve the great achievements of socialist revolution and socialist construction. We, the sons and daughters of the working class, swear to you: we will always follow you. According to the direction you point out, the working class will always stand on the front line of the battle.
    When Comrade Liu Shaoqi delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, another climax appeared in the venue. Countless applause interrupted Comrade Liu Shaoqi's congratulatory speech, indicating that the Chinese working class resolutely supports the Party's call. Especially when Comrade Liu Shaoqi said, "The basic task of our working class and our people in the next ten to 15 years is, on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, to implement the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industries, modern agriculture and modern science and culture," when he said, "In 15 years, the Soviet Union's industry and agriculture may catch up with or surpass the United States in terms of the output of the most important products, and we should strive to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in the same period," the applause was even more enthusiastic and lasting, and people's faces could not hide the excitement in their hearts. The prospect of fifteen years summons us to advance heroically. We will never fail the Party's expectations, we will leave the imperialist countries far behind in the peaceful competition between socialism and capitalism. (Attached pictures)

　　工人阶级的力量和决心
　　——记中国工会第八次全国代表大会开幕
　　本报记者　范荣康
    中国工会第八次全国代表大会开幕了。
    从中国工会第七次全国代表大会到第八次全国代表大会，这中间只过了四年多的时间。四年，在人类的历史上只是一个短促的瞬间，在中国工人运动的历史上也只是一个并不很长的时期。但这短短的四年里，我们国家经历了多么深刻的变化呵！四年前，取得社会主义革命的胜利，还只是一个奋斗的远景，今天，社会主义革命不但已经在经济上取得基本胜利，而且经过全民整风和反右派斗争，在政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命也已经取得决定性的胜利。我国几千年来阶级剥削制度的历史，已由我们这一代宣告基本结束了。多少年来，我们的人民梦寐以求的，为之流血牺牲的社会主义制度，已经基本上建立起来了。四年前，我们还刚刚踏上第一个五年计划的建设大道；今天，第一个五年计划已经完成和超额完成了，千百个新的工厂已经投入生产，我们有了自己制造的飞机、汽车、轮船、火车头和各种各样的机床，国民经济的各个部门都有了巨大的发展。现在，规模更大的第二个五年计划又在召唤我们朝着新的高度前进。一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义的强大中国，正在我们的艰苦劳动中日夜成长。在这短短的四年里，世界形势也发生了多么深刻的变化呵！人类的历史已经进入一个有利于社会主义的新的转折点。“东风压倒西风”，社会主义的力量和争取和平、民主、民族解放运动的力量，已经明显地超过了帝国主义侵略阵营的力量。人类正朝着光明的未来前进。
    中国的工会，在中国工人阶级的伟大的先锋队——中国共产党的领导下，为把我们的国家建设成为一个繁荣富强的社会主义国家，贡献了重大的作用。我们的工会，现在是一个拥有一千六百三十多万会员的强大的工会了。在她的十五万七千多个基层组织、十万多个各种工作委员会和一百四十一万个工会小组中，有三百八十九万名积极分子，带动着广大职工群众，为完成国家计划而奋斗。四年来，社会主义竞赛的浪潮席卷全国。广大职工中涌现出二百六十万名先进生产者，提出了四百五十六万件合理化建议。就在这个会场里，在一千多名正式代表和候补代表中，就有许许多多社会主义竞赛的优秀的组织者，他们是先进思想和先进经验的播种者。看！那里坐着的，不是中共沈阳冶炼厂的党委书记魏文风吗？几年前，当他从国民党手中把沈阳冶炼厂接收下来的时候，遇到多少困难呵！全厂找不出一个冶炼的能手。唯一被称为“炼铜专家”的陈连高，只是借了搬运矿石的机会，到过冶炼炉房，窥伺过日本工人一些零星的操作情况。就在陈连高的指挥下，第一次试炼失败了，第二次试炼又失败了。这位忠心耿耿的老工人哭倒在冶炼炉旁。如今，这个在日本人经营的时候只能生产在工业上用途不大的粗铜的工厂，已经大量生产具有国际水平的电解铜了，产量的提高更是不可同日而语。在沈阳冶炼厂的这些翻天复地的变化中，工会正确地执行了党的方针，在企业工作的各个方面和工人生活的各个方面，起了重大的作用。年年计划下达以后，党通过工会发动群众讨论，挖掘潜力，照例要把计划指标提高。在实现计划的过程中，党通过工会组织竞赛，总结和推广先进经验，照例会涌现出大批先进生产者。魏文风说：“这些，已经成为企业生活的规律了”。是的，哪一个企业的生活不是这样的沸腾着？在上海，去年出现的一个比一个更高的生产新纪录，至今仍未在人们的记忆中褪色。今天，三级青工宋万庆赶过切削能手盛利，明天，盛利又把宋万庆创造的新纪录丢在后面。今天，青年女工浦玉珍赶过了著名的劳动模范黄宝妹；明天，黄宝妹又走在浦玉珍的前面。在这永无了期的竞赛浪潮中，当报纸和广播电台不断地报道这些日日刷新的新纪录时，有多少人在奋起直追呵！我们的生产，我们的建设事业，正是依靠着党的领导，依靠着工会的许多具体细致的思想工作和组织工作、依靠着广大职工的生产积极性和创造性，节节前进。
    就在这个会场里，在一千多名正式代表和候补代表中，也有许许多多在第一个五年计划期间的劳动竞赛中出现的生产上和工会工作中的积极分子。看！那里坐着的不是满洲里市百货公司的营业员，一等劳动模范包奇英吗？这位蒙古族姑娘今年才十八岁。五年前，当我们的国家刚开始实行第一个五年计划的时候，包奇英还完完全全是一个小女孩。但今天，人们选她出席了工人阶级的代表大会。她是工人阶级中新的血液。天津市的代表，天津国棉一厂的纺织女工、工会小组长李淑珍，虽然已经有十几年的工龄，但也还只是一个二十五岁的青年人。她个子不高，戴着一副眼镜。一眼看去，满像一个女学生，一个普普通通的妈妈的好女儿。有谁知道，这位寻常的工会小组长，为了搞好生产，搞好小组的团结，操了多少心，做了多少工作？一个叫张耀春的女工，是刚进厂的新工人，贪玩、爱跳舞，脾气大，谁也治不了她。李淑珍不嫌烦，三番五次地找她谈心，碰了壁，也不泄气。张耀春没有地方住，她让她住在自己的家里，夜夜深谈。张耀春终于有了进步，成为工会的积极分子，团的小组长。一个和李淑珍同名同姓的女工，大家叫她小李淑珍的，生产时老是打瞌睡，月月完不成计划，政治学习等集体生活也不参加。李淑珍知道小李淑珍的落后，是由于家庭不和，家务劳动繁重造成的。她和她的小组的积极分子一次又一次地找小李淑珍和小李淑珍的丈夫、婆婆谈话，帮助他们搞好家庭关系。星期日，十几名工会会员自己掏钱买了肥皂、针、线，分成小组，一齐到小李淑珍家中，捥起袖子就把小李淑珍家中的被子拆洗了，玻璃窗擦得一干二净。谁见过这样热心的人！小李淑珍的家庭从此和睦了，小李淑珍自己也积极争取进步，后来成为先进生产者。去年8月间，小组的生产质量忽然下降了。为什么呢？李淑珍发现姑娘们一年比一年大了，不知从什么时候起，刮起了一阵“搞对象”的风。车间里、寝室里，常常几个人挤在一起私下交谈：“你有没有？”
  “你那个怎么样？”爱情，关系着每一个人的幸福，工会不能袖手旁观。于是，一个大家兴致勃勃又有点羞羞答答的座谈会开始了。有介绍找对象的经验的：怎样的对象才是工人应该选择的对象？有介绍安排婚后生活的经验的：怎样才能带好孩子又不影响生产？也有叙说自己的理想，希望别人给介绍对象的。私下交谈的问题也拿到会议上来谈了。彼此之间了解得更深，团结得更亲密了。李淑珍小组，只是我国一百四十一万个工会小组中的一个。人们在这些充满着温暖的小组里生活着，不断地进行着自我教育，鞭策着自己为国家的建设事业付出更大的力量。
    中国工会的力量的源泉，中国工人阶级的力量的源泉，乃是由于中国共产党的领导。当毛泽东同志、中共中央和中央人民政府的其他负责同志走上主席台的时候，全场起立，欢呼声雷动，掌声历久不息。毛主席站在主席台的中间，始而同大家一起鼓掌，继而摆着双手，请大家坐下。但大家坐不下去。人们的眼睛盯着主席台，心飞向主席台，掌声送上主席台。欲罢不能，毛主席又同大家一起鼓起掌来。这时候，多少人的眼里闪着激动的泪花。一千多人的心里共鸣着一个思想：亲爱的毛主席！亲爱的共产党！我们，工人阶级的儿女，站在您的面前。是您领导我们，经过了长期的革命斗争，建立了中华人民共和国。是您领导我们，经过了千辛万苦，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成绩。我们，工人阶级的儿女，向您宣誓：我们永远跟着您走。按照您所指的方向，工人阶级永远会站在战斗的最前线。
    当刘少奇同志代表中共中央向大会致祝词时，全场又出现了一个高潮。无数次的掌声打断了刘少奇同志的祝词，表明中国工人阶级坚决拥护党的号召。特别是当刘少奇同志说到“我国工人阶级和我国人民在今后十年到十五年内的基本任务，就是要在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行工农业同时并举的方针，把我国建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国”的时候，说到“在十五年后，苏联的工农业在最重要产品的产量方面可能赶上或者超过美国，我们应当争取在同一时期，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国”的时候，掌声更是热烈、持久，人们的脸上掩饰不住心内的激动。十五年后的远景召唤我们英勇地前进。我们决不辜负党的期望，我们要在社会主义和资本主义的和平竞赛中，把帝国主义国家远远抛在后面。（附图片）
