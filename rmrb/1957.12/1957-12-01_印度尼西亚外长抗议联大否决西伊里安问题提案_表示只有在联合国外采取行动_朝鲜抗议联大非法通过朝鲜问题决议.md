Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly, in its plenary meeting on the 29th, rejected the joint proposal by eighteen Asian-African countries and Bolivia requesting the Netherlands and Indonesia to resume negotiations on the West Irian issue. This proposal had been passed by a majority vote in the Political Committee, but it failed to obtain the two-thirds majority required for the passage of a proposal in the plenary meeting.

　　Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio stated after the vote that since the meeting had rejected this proposal for peaceful negotiations, Indonesia would "have to take action outside the United Nations."

　　He said that since reconciliation was not possible, his government "might take steps which might not contribute to good relations with the Netherlands." He said Indonesia "will now continue to shoulder its responsibilities with a clear conscience until we achieve complete Indonesian national sovereignty, including West Irian."

　　Indonesian representative to the United Nations, Sastroamidjojo, stated before the vote on the proposal that preventing peaceful negotiations to resolve the colonial issue of West Irian would have dangerous consequences. Sastroamidjojo accused the Netherlands of consistently being unwilling to hold negotiations to peacefully resolve this long-standing political dispute. He said that according to current information, the Dutch, in addition to increasing their naval power in and around the waters of West Irian, are also preparing other military actions. He said that in the current international situation, the implications and consequences of this development are clearly dangerous.

　　On the same day, the plenary meeting passed the proposal on the Korean question submitted by the United States and eleven other countries. This proposal reiterated the need to unify Korea based on the conditions put forward by the United States and other countries that invaded Korea.

　　Before the vote on the proposal, Soviet representative Sobolev spoke at the meeting, accusing the United States of obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean question. He pointed out that the United States deliberately wants South Korea to continue to serve as a base for the stationing of American troops to threaten the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and China. Sobolev said that the Korean question cannot be resolved without the participation of representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He reiterated the proposals such as direct negotiations between North and South Korea and the convening of an international conference of relevant countries.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 30th dispatch: A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today saying that as a result of pressure from the United States, the 12th United Nations General Assembly unilaterally discussed the Korean question without the participation of representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and passed a resolution on the Korean question, thus grossly violating the provisions of the United Nations Charter.

　　The statement said that the outcome of this UN General Assembly's discussion of the Korean question, which once again passed such a resolution, shows that the US ruling clique is unwilling to resolve the Korean question fairly and continues to use the United Nations to achieve its goal of permanently dividing Korea.

　　The statement pointed out that the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that the resolution on the Korean question passed by the 12th UN General Assembly this time, like some of the previous resolutions on the Korean question passed by the UN General Assembly, is completely illegal, and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea cannot recognize it.

　  印度尼西亚外长抗议联大否决西伊里安问题提案
　　表示只有在联合国外采取行动
　  朝鲜抗议联大非法通过朝鲜问题决议
    据新华社30日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会在29日全体会议上，否决了十八个亚非国家和玻利维亚联合提出的要求荷兰和印度尼西亚就西伊里安问题重新举行谈判的提案。这个提案曾经在政治委员会以过半数的多数票获得通过，而在全体会议表决时，没有获得通过提案所需要的三分之二多数票。
    印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约在会议表决之后表示，既然会议否决了这个建议和平谈判的提案，印度尼西亚“只好在联合国外采取行动”。
    他说，既然和解没有可能，他的政府“可能采取那些可能无助于对荷兰的良好关系的步骤”。他说，印度尼西亚“现在将问心无愧地继续担负自己的重任，直到我们取得印度尼西亚国家包括西伊里安在内的全部主权为止。”
    印度尼西亚出席联合国代表沙斯特罗阿米佐约在提案表决前发言指出，阻遏和平谈判解决西伊里安这样的殖民地问题将会产生危险的后果。沙斯特罗阿米佐约指责荷兰一直不愿意举行谈判以和平解决这个长期悬而未决的政治争论。他说，根据目前消息，荷兰人除了增加他们在西伊里安海面及其周围的海军力量以外，还正在准备其他军事行动。他说，在目前国际情况下，这种事态发展的含意和后果显然是危险的。
    同一天，全体会议通过了美国等十一国关于朝鲜问题的提案。这个提案重申要根据美国和其他侵略朝鲜国家提出的条件来统一朝鲜。
    在表决提案之前，苏联代表索波列夫在会上发言，指责美国阻碍朝鲜问题的和平解决。他指出，美国蓄意要南朝鲜继续作为驻扎美国军队的基地，来威胁朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中国。索波列夫说，没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加，朝鲜问题不可能得到解决。他重申应该由南北朝鲜之间举行直接谈判、召开有关国家的国际会议等项主张。
    据新华社平壤30日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省发言人今天发表声明说，由于美国施加压力的结果，第十二届联合国大会在没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加的情况下片面地讨论了朝鲜问题，并且通过关于朝鲜问题的决议，这样就粗暴地违反了联合国宪章的规定。
    声明说，这次联合国大会讨论朝鲜问题的结果，再一次通过了这样的决议，这种情况说明美国统治集团不愿意公正解决朝鲜问题，并且继续利用联合国来达到永久分裂朝鲜的目的。
    声明指出，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为，第十二届联合国大会这次通过的关于朝鲜问题的决议也像联合国大会以前通过的关于朝鲜问题的一些决议一样，完全是非法的，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府不能予以承认。
