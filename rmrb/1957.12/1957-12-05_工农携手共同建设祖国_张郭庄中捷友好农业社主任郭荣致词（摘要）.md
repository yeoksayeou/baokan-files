　　Workers and Peasants Join Hands to Build the Motherland
　　Speech by Guo Rong, Director of the Zhangguozhuang Sino-Czech Friendship Agricultural Cooperative (Excerpt)
    For the past two years, the peasants in the suburbs of the capital, together with peasants across the country, under the leadership of the working class and its party, the Chinese Communist Party, have made tremendous achievements in realizing agricultural collectivization, developing agricultural production, and increasing yield per unit area. These achievements have not only inspired our enthusiasm for production, but, more importantly, have further consolidated the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class. We peasants will forever follow the Communist Party and the elder brother workers, joining hands to build our great socialist modernized industrial and agricultural power.
    In order to realize the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), the members of the Zhangguozhuang Sino-Czech Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative are determined to run the cooperative diligently and frugally, work hard, and catch up with or exceed the production and living standards of local well-to-do middle peasants within two or three years. In fact, 50% of our members have already caught up with or exceeded them in terms of living standards.
    All members of the Sino-Czech Friendship Agricultural Cooperative have expressed their willingness to emulate the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains to build water conservancy projects. Making "high water bow its head and river water climb the mountains" is no longer a slogan but a practical action. Currently, our cooperative is experiencing a vibrant winter production campaign. Building on this year's bumper harvest, our production is also developing rapidly. In a few years, we will turn the barren slopes of our cooperative into pastures, dry land into vegetable fields, and slopes into orchards, completely changing the face of the countryside. Our hard work requires the strong support of our elder brother workers, and even more the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao.

　　工农携手共同建设祖国
　　张郭庄中捷友好农业社主任郭荣致词（摘要）
    两年以来，首都郊区的农民和全国农民一道，在工人阶级及其政党中国共产党的领导下，为实现农业合作化和发展农业生产，以及提高单位面积产量等方面，已经取得了巨大的成就。这些成就的取得不仅鼓舞了我们的生产积极性，重要的是更加巩固了工人阶级领导下的工农联盟。我们农民永远跟着共产党走，跟着工人老大哥走，共同携起手来建设我们伟大的社会主义现代化的工业和农业的强国。
    为了实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的要求，张郭庄中捷友好农业生产合作社的社员有决心在两三年的时间里，勤俭办社，艰苦奋斗，赶上或者超过当地富裕中农的生产和生活水平。事实上我们现在已经有50％的社员在生活水平上赶上或者超过了他们。
    中捷友好农业社的全体社员纷纷表示要拿出愚公移山的干劲兴修水利。要使“高水低头、河水上山”已经不是口号而是实际行动了。目前我们社里正掀起热火朝天的冬季大生产运动，在今年丰收的基础上，我们的生产也是日新月异地发展着。几年以后使我们社的荒坡变成牧场，旱地变成菜田，坡地变成果园，彻底改变农村的面貌。我们的辛勤劳动，需要工人老大哥的大力支援，更需要党和毛主席的指引。
