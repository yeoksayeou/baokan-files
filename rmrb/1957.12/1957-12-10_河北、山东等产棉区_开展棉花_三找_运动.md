Cotton Producing Areas in Hebei, Shandong, etc.
Launch Cotton "Three Searches" Campaign

    This newspaper reports that cotton-producing areas in Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces are currently conducting a cotton "Three Searches" campaign. According to incomplete statistics from over 1,700 agricultural cooperatives in the Handan, Xingtai, and Shijiazhuang regions of Hebei Province, more than 1.7 million catties of fallen cotton, "eyelash" cotton, and stiff-boll cotton have been found in more than 500,000 mu of cotton fields. In Gaotang County, Shandong Province, 98 agricultural cooperatives had picked over 700,000 catties of seed cotton by October 31. Local experiences have proven that approximately three catties of seed cotton can be found per mu of cotton field. If all 80 million mu of cotton fields across the country were thoroughly picked clean, the nation could increase its seed cotton yield by over 240 million catties; at a price of two jiao per catty, agricultural cooperatives could increase their income by more than 48 million yuan.

    Due to the abundant cotton harvest this year, some cotton farmers do not prioritize picking these scattered cotton remnants. Some cotton farmers say, "Picking these cotton scraps isn't worth the work points." Others say, "You can't pick all the cotton, just as you can't catch all the fish." In fact, this statement is incorrect. For example, the Leijiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Shulu County, Hebei Province, organized female laborers to clean more than 1,400 mu of cotton fields in three days, finding a total of more than 4,200 catties of cotton.

    This year, the Jiayu County Farm in Hubei Province had 203 mu of cotton fields and removed the cotton stalks early to plant winter crops. However, they discovered that each cotton stalk still had an average of three to four cotton bolls. They then dried the cotton stalks in sheds and ended up collecting more than 10,000 catties of seed cotton, an average of more than 50 catties of seed cotton per mu.

    The county has 16,000 mu of cotton fields and has comprehensively implemented measures such as drying and re-picking cotton stalks, as well as collecting remaining cotton bolls in the fields, which will allow for an additional 800,000 catties of seed cotton to be collected.

### 河北、山东等产棉区　开展棉花“三找”运动

　　河北、山东等产棉区
　　开展棉花“三找”运动
    本报讯　河北、山东等产棉区，目前正在开展棉花“三找运动”，据河北省邯郸、邢台、石家庄三个专区一千七百多个农业社的不完全统计，在五十多万亩棉田里找出了落地棉、“眼睫毛”，僵瓣棉共一百七十多万斤。山东高唐县有九十八个农业社，截至10月31日止共拾摘籽棉七十多万斤。各地经验证明，每亩棉田大约可找出三斤左右的籽棉。全国八千多万亩棉田，如果都做到摘干拾净，国家就可以增加籽棉二万四千多万斤；以每斤二角计算，农业社就可以增加四千八百多万元的收入。
    由于今年棉花获得了丰收，有些棉农不重视收摘这些零星棉花。有的棉农说：“拾摘这些棉花不够工分钱。”有的说：“摘不净的棉花，捉不尽的鱼。”其实这种说法是错误的，例如河北省束鹿县雷家庄农业社，组织妇女劳力在三天内就清理了一千四百多亩棉田，共找出四千二百多斤棉花。　（任善基）
    湖北嘉鱼县农场今年有二百零三亩棉田，提早拔去棉秸，种上了冬播作物。但他们发现每株棉秸上平均都还有三—四个棉桃，于是就将棉秆棚晒着，结果又捡籽棉一万多斤，平均每亩多捡了籽棉五十斤。
    该县有一万六千亩棉田，已全面推行了棉秆翻晒和重捡棉花以及收拾田间残落的棉桃等措施，将可再捡籽棉八十万斤。
