　　How to Improve the Construction System?
　　Jun Qian
　　Recently, many comrades have been discussing the issue of improving the construction system. Many comrades believe that the construction system needs to be improved, and the current multi-headed, departmental leadership has caused a lot of waste and unreasonable phenomena. I completely agree with this opinion. Multi-headed departmental leadership does have many shortcomings: First, construction forces cannot be arranged uniformly, nor can they achieve relative stability in a certain area, and long-distance two-way transfers are frequent, resulting in significant waste. Second, base planning and construction cannot be carried out in a unified manner, and current and long-term needs are not easily combined. Third, construction machinery and other equipment are managed separately by various departments, which cannot be used reasonably, resulting in very low utilization rates. Fourth, each system has its own set of rules and regulations, especially inconsistencies in wage and welfare provisions, which cause a lot of complaints among employees and affect unity.
　　From the above situation, the current construction system does need to be improved. As for how to improve it, everyone does not have a consistent view. We believe that the best approach should be to delegate some construction enterprises to the management of provinces and cities, and at the same time establish a unified ministry for managing construction projects in the central government (excluding mining, water conservancy, post and telecommunications, seaports, railways, and highways). Construction units undertaking national key engineering construction tasks should be under the dual leadership of the central competent ministry and the provincial and municipal Party committees.
　　Our reasons are as follows: First, it is better for the central competent construction ministry to contact various industrial ministries, organize project sequencing, issue tasks, organize material supply, apply for and allocate materials, organize foreign orders, and balance and adjust important machinery. Second, the construction of key projects is more complex, and some larger issues are difficult to resolve within the scope of a province or city, and it is impossible for each province and city to have corresponding technical capabilities and material foundation; solving special or important technical problems in construction, promoting major advanced experiences, and organizing other aspects of support all need to be done by the central competent department. Third, if large-scale metallurgical enterprises, chemical enterprises, large power grids, large power stations, oil mining enterprises, large and precision machinery factories, military factories, and other technically complex factories are still managed by the central industrial ministries, then the new construction, expansion, or renovation projects of this type of enterprise should be managed by the central competent construction ministry. It would be very difficult for provinces and cities to manage this type of project alone. This is because, after the factory construction task is determined, it is necessary to determine the overall progress, have various plans and designs, and organize various preparatory work. After construction starts, it is also necessary to organize various coordination efforts (design, construction, material supply, scientific research, etc.). Would it be better for each industrial department to contact all relevant provinces and cities, or to contact a unified construction department? Obviously, the latter approach is much better. At the same time, the construction department has companies that undertake comprehensive construction and installation tasks. Since undertaking industrial construction tasks and implementing industrialized construction, these companies have become the overall planners and organizers of various specialized construction projects. In recent years, they have also accumulated some experience and have certain technical equipment. These general contracting companies responsible for national key projects are also better led by the central competent construction ministry. Fourth, the major balancing of construction forces within the country will still exist in the future.
　　The four tasks mentioned above should be the responsibility of the central competent construction ministry; it is also essential for provinces and cities to strengthen their leadership over industrial construction units. In recent years, provinces and cities have conducted comprehensive ideological and policy leadership over construction units, and in the future, they can strengthen the following aspects of leadership: leading coordination and cooperation in various aspects within their jurisdiction, conducting balance and dispatching, conducting regional planning; managing cadres; supervising construction plans and engineering quality, and so on.
　　In summary, our opinion is: generally delegate construction enterprises, and implement dual leadership for enterprises undertaking national key engineering construction tasks. Establish a unified construction management ministry in the central government, and establish unified engineering administrations according to the distribution of projects; this type of administration accepts the dual leadership of the provincial and municipal Party committees and the central competent ministry; the central competent construction ministry is responsible for handling matters that are more difficult for provinces and cities to handle. We believe that this organizational form and division of leadership is more reasonable.
　　Some comrades advocate that all construction enterprises should be delegated to the management of provinces and cities. Under the current circumstances, implementing this approach would have many difficulties and would cause some new contradictions. This can be seen from the previous analysis.
　　In addition, some comrades advocate that each industrial ministry should operate its own construction business. According to the Soviet Union's many years of experience and our own past experience, taking the old road of self-operation is not appropriate. Self-operation will further form multi-headed leadership; self-operation is most likely to develop a supply system mentality, making it impossible for construction enterprises to better implement the principles of economic accounting; self-operation is also detrimental to stabilizing professional construction forces, improving technology, accumulating experience, and improving enterprise management. As for saying that self-operation can reduce "buck-passing" and be more convenient, etc., these cannot be reasons why self-operation is necessary. Because there are only two reasons for "buck-passing" between Party A and Party B: one is an ideological problem, and the other is a problem of coordination and cooperation in work. These problems can all be solved by strengthening the work in all aspects.

### 建筑体制怎样改进？

　　建筑体制怎样改进？
    均千
    最近不少同志在谈论改进建筑体制的问题。许多同志都认为建筑体制需要改进，目前这种多头的条条领导造成了很多浪费和不合理的现象。我完全同意这个意见。多头的条条领导的确有许多缺点：第一、施工力量不能统一安排，也无法在一定地区取得相对的稳定，远距离的相向调动很多，浪费很大。第二、不能统一地进行基地规划和基地建设，目前和长远的需要也不容易结合。第三、施工机械及其他设备由各部门分别掌管，不能合理使用，利用率很低。第四、各系统都有自己的一套规章制度，特别是工资福利方面的规定不一致，使职工相互意见很多，影响团结。
    从上述情况来看，目前的建筑体制确实需要改进。至于怎样改进，大家还没有一致的看法。我们认为，最好的办法应该是：下放一部分建筑企业，交省市管理，同时在中央建立一个统一的管理建筑工程的部（不包括矿井、水利、邮电、海港、铁路、公路）。担任国家重点工程建设任务的施工单位，由中央主管部和省市委实行双重领导。
    我们的理由是这样的：第一、联系各工业部，组织工程排队，下达任务，组织物资供应，申请和调拨材料，组织国外订货，平衡和调整重要机械等工作，由中央主管建筑的部去做比较好。第二、重点工程的建设比较复杂，有些较大的问题在一个省、市的范围内难以解决，每个省市也不可能都有相应的技术力量和物质基础；解决施工中特殊的或者重要的技术问题，推广主要的先进经验，组织其他方面的支援等工作，都需要由中央主管部门来做。第三、如果大型的冶金企业、化工企业、大电力网、大电站、石油采矿企业、大型和精密机械工厂、军事工厂以及其他技术复杂的工厂仍归中央各工业部管理，那末，这一类企业的新建、扩建或改建工程，由中央主管建筑的部管理就比较好。这一类工程由省市单独管理是困难很多的。这是因为，建厂任务确定以后，要确定总进度，要有各种规划和设计，要组织各项准备工作，动工以后还需要组织各项配合工作（设计、施工、材料供应、科学研究等）。这么多工作，由各工业部门向有关的所有省市联系好呢，还是统一地向一个建筑部门联系好呢？显然，采取后一种方法要好得多。同时，建筑部门有一种担负全面建筑安装任务的公司。这种公司自从担负工业建筑任务和实行工业化施工以来，已经成为各种专业施工的总规划人和组织者了。这几年，它们也积累了一些经验，有了一定的技术装备。这种担任国家重点工程的总包公司，也以归中央主管建筑的部领导为好。第四、建筑力量在全国范围内的大的平衡工作，今后仍然存在。
    上面所谈的四项工作，应该由中央主管建筑的部负责；省、市加强对工业建筑单位的领导也十分必要。这几年，省、市已经对建筑单位进行了全面的思想领导和政策领导，今后还可以加强以下几个方面的领导工作：在所辖区域内领导各方面的协作配合，进行平衡调度，进行区域规划；管理干部；监督施工计划和工程质量，等等。
    总起来讲，我们的意见是：一般建筑企业下放，担负国家重点工程建设任务的企业实行双重领导。在中央建立统一的管理建筑的部，根据工程分布情况，按区域建立统一的工程管理局；这种管理局接受省、市委和中央主管部的双重领导；中央主管建筑的部负责办理省、市比较难办的事情。我们认为，这种组织形式和领导分工是比较合理的。
    有的同志主张建筑企业全部下放，由省、市管理。在目前情况下，实行这一作法，有不少困难，而且会引起一些新的矛盾。这从前面的分析中就可以看出来。
    另外有些同志主张由各工业部自营建筑业务。根据苏联多年的经验和我们自己过去的体会，走自营的老路是不妥当的。自营会更加形成多头领导；自营最容易发展供给制思想，使建筑企业不能很好地贯彻经济核算的原则；自营对固定建筑专业力量、提高技术、积累经验、改善企业管理也是不利的。至于说自营可以减少“扯皮”，使用方便等等，也不能成为必须自营的理由。因为甲乙双方“扯皮”不外两种原因：一是思想问题，一是工作中的协作配合问题。这些问题都是可以通过加强各方面的工作而得到解决的。
