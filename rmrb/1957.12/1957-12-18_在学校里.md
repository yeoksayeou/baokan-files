    At School
    Building the Campus
    Two thousand faculty, staff, and students from Shanghai First Normal College are building the campus. The president, Party secretary, professors, and students are all moving bricks, stones, and mortar together. Some people continued to work on the construction site even after developing blisters on their hands. Some students posted a big-character poster after labor, saying, "We hope to participate in physical labor frequently and learn from the workers and peasants." Currently, the college has made a rule to set aside a certain amount of time every Friday for faculty and students to participate in physical labor. (Yu)
    Sweeping the Streets at Midnight
    Students from Beijing No. 2 Middle School enthusiastically participate in physical labor. Students in Class 3 of Senior Grade 2 once helped the sanitation team sweep the streets, going to sweep at 1:30 in the morning. Although it was very cold that day, everyone worked vigorously. After they finished sweeping Wangfujing Street, they also went to sweep Donghuamen and Nanheyan streets, completing the task ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota. Students in Class 1 of Senior Grade 3 worked as salespersons at Xinhua Bookstore and washed trolley cars at the trolley company. Students in Junior Grades 1 and 2 also served at the Children's Cinema and Red Star Cinema. Students in Class 8 of Junior Grade 3 and several classes of Senior Grade 1 also participated in the construction of the Dongdan District Youth Shooting Range.
    The physical labor of the students at this school is organized and guided by the Labor Department of the student union. As early as mid-September, all faculty and students of No. 2 Middle School used their holidays to help the Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative harvest corn. During that labor, they generally requested to participate in physical labor frequently to train themselves. Under everyone's request, the Labor Department of the student union was established. (Zhang Juemin)
    Helping Farmers
    More than nine hundred faculty, staff, and students from Quanjiao Middle School and Quanjiao Normal School in Anhui Province went to the Shuguang, Nanping, and Qingchun Agricultural Cooperatives to help farmers with production. After five days of labor, they treadled waterwheels to irrigate more than 160 mu of farmland and beat earth clods on more than 80 mu. All faculty, staff, and students demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and responsibility in their work. Quanjiao Normal School formulated four labor disciplines, requiring everyone to strictly abide by the various disciplines of the agricultural cooperative, take good care of production tools, obey the command of the production team, and complete the tasks assigned by the production team on time, with good quality, and in the required quantity. By doing so, they not only left a good impression on the commune members but also greatly boosted the commune members' production enthusiasm. Everyone received a profound labor education in the fight against drought and rush-planting campaign, strengthening their labor viewpoint.

    在学校里
    修建校园
    上海第一师范学院两千多师生员工修建校园。院长、党委书记、教授和学生们一起搬砖石和泥灰，有的人手上磨出了泡还坚持在工地上。有些学生在劳动过后贴出一张大字报，上面说，“我们希望经常参加体力劳动，向工农学习。”目前，这个学院已作出规定，每周星期五抽出一定时间，给师生参加体力劳动。（余）
    半夜扫街
    北京市二中学生踊跃参加体力劳动。高二（三）班学生有一次帮助清洁队扫大街，半夜一点半钟就去扫。虽然那天很冷，但是大家干得很起劲。他们扫完了王府井大街，还去扫东华门和南河沿的街道，提前并超额完成了任务。高三（一）班的学生到新华书店做售货员，到电车公司洗刷电车。初一和初二的学生，还到儿童电影院和红星电影院服务。初三（八）班和高一几个班的学生还参加了修建东单区青年靶场的劳动。
    这个学校学生的体力劳动，是由学生会的劳动部组织和指导的。还在9月中旬，二中全体师生就利用假日帮助星火农业社收割玉米。在那次劳动中，他们普遍要求能经常参加体力劳动来锻炼自己。学生会劳动部就在大家的要求下成立了。（张觉民）
    帮助农民
    安徽省全椒中学和全椒师范学校九百多师生员工，到曙光、南屏、青春等农业社去帮助农民生产。经过五天的劳动，他们车水浇田一百六十多亩，打土块八十多亩。全体师生员工在劳动中表现了高度的热情和责任心。全椒师范学校订出了四项劳动纪律，要求大家严格遵守农业社的各项纪律，爱护生产工具，服从生产队指挥，按时按质按数完成生产队交给的任务。他们这样做了，不但给社员们留下了良好的印象，而且大大鼓舞了社员们的生产情绪。大家在抗旱抢种运动中，受到了一次深刻的劳动教育，加强了劳动观点。
