Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 4th dispatch: Many American newspapers believe that the Soviet Union has taken the lead in military strength.

The "Washington Post" published an article by the famous commentator Drew Pearson on November 29, saying that the United States is currently facing an "unquestionable and unpleasant" fact: the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in modern weaponry. He said that CIA Director Allen Dulles has repeatedly submitted reports to the White House on this issue, which, coupled with "other authoritative sources," has made it possible to make such a "definite statement."

Pearson said that the "unvarnished" facts about the comparison of military strength between the United States and the Soviet Union are as follows: (1) In terms of nuclear energy, "The Soviet Union, which detonated its first atomic bomb four years later than the United States, has actually caught up with the United States in terms of nuclear weapon firepower today." (2) In the manufacturing of atomic rockets capable of space flight, "The Soviet Union is also running ahead of the United States." (3) Air Force – "Numerically speaking, the Soviet Union today possesses the largest air force in the world," and in terms of "air force weapons, it has been able to match the finest achievements of the United States." As for intercontinental jet bombers and fighters, the Soviet Union also has more than the United States, and it is believed that their quality is also superior to that of the United States.

Pearson said that the Soviet army is equipped with rockets, trained in atomic warfare, and is highly mobile. It can match the U.S.'s vaunted five-unit atomic division. As for naval power, in just a few years, the Soviet Union has leapt to second place in the world.

Pearson had also published an article in the same newspaper on the 28th, saying that due to the Soviet Union's military strength, the United States "will be defeated" when fighting the Soviet Union. The United States would be "lucky" to be able to destroy five or six Soviet cities in a war.

The "New York Times" has also recently published articles discussing the Soviet Union's superiority over the United States in missiles. The article said that some people in the United States believe, based on estimates from the intelligence agency, that the Soviet Union already possesses a large number of medium-range missiles, which can eliminate most of the aircraft stationed at American overseas military bases. It will take at least many months before the United States can deploy "retaliatory forces" at these bases. As for intercontinental missiles, the Soviet Union has successfully tested them, but the American "Atlas" intercontinental missile has failed several times in testing.

According to an estimate by the American rocket expert Braun on the 2nd, it will take at least five years for the United States to catch up with the Soviet Union in the development of long-range missiles and space tools, and it must also make "sacrifices that the United States has not yet begun to make."

Durham, chairman of the Congressional Atomic Energy Committee, spoke on the 1st about the "inadequacy" of the United States' plan to develop atomic energy. He pointed out that in this regard, the technological progress of the Soviet Union is a "serious challenge" to the United States "militarily" and "psychologically."

　　美国报刊纷纷为实力政策报丧
　　承认在军事方面东风压倒西风
　　苏联的核武器、导弹和空军等都超过美国
    新华社4日讯　华盛顿消息：美国许多报刊认为，在军事力量方面，苏联已经走在美国的前面。
      “华盛顿邮报”11月29日刊载了著名评论员德鲁·皮尔逊的一篇文章说，美国目前面临的一个“不容置疑和不愉快”的事实是，苏联在现代化武器方面超过了美国。他说，中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯就这个问题向白宫接二连三地提出了报告，这加上“其他权威性的消息来源”，已经使人可以作出这样“肯定的言论”。
    皮尔逊说，关于美苏军事力量对比的“没有包糖衣”的事实有下列一些：（一）在核能方面，“比美国迟四年爆炸第一颗原子弹的苏联今天在核武器火力方面实际上已经追上美国”。（二）在能够作空间飞行的原子火箭的制造方面，
  “苏联也跑在美国的前面”。（三）空军——
  “在数字上讲，苏联今天拥有世界上最大的一支空军”，并且在“空军武器方面已经能够同美国最优良的成就并驾齐驱”。至于洲际喷气轰炸机和战斗机，苏联也比美国多，而且据认为质量也胜过美国。
    皮尔逊说，苏联的陆军配备着火箭，受过原子战争的训练，具有高度的机动性。它可以同美国所吹嘘的五单位原子师匹敌。至于海军力量，在不多几年间，苏联已经跃升为世界第二位。
    皮尔逊28日还曾经在同一家报纸上发表文章说，由于苏联的军事力量，美国同苏联作战时“将要打败仗”。美国在战争中能够摧毁五六座苏联城市就算是“幸运的了”。
      “纽约时报”最近也发表文章，谈论苏联在导弹方面胜过美国的情况。文章说，美国一些人士根据情报局的估计认为，苏联已经拥有大量的中程导弹，它可以消灭驻在美国海外军事基地的大部分飞机。最少要过许多个月，美国才可以在这些基地上布置“还击的力量”。至于洲际导弹，苏联已经试验成功，但是美国的“阿特拉斯”洲际导弹几次试验都已失败。
    据美国火箭专家布劳恩2日估计，美国要在远程导弹和空间工具的发展方面赶上苏联，至少将需要五年时间，而且还必须作出“美国还没有开始作”的“牺牲”。
    国会原子能委员会主席达拉姆1日谈到美国发展原子能的计划“不充分”的问题。他指出，在这方面，苏联的技术进步在“军事上”和“心理上”对于美国都是一个“严重的挑战”。
