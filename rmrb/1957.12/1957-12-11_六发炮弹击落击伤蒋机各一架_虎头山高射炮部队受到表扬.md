Xinhua News Agency, 10th - The Air Force Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued a circular on the 7th, commending the anti-aircraft artillery that shot down and damaged Chiang Kai-shek's planes in the air battle over Tiger Head Mountain on the Fujian Front.

    The circular said that the anti-aircraft artillery on Tiger Head Mountain on the Fujian Front of the Chinese People's Liberation Army shot down and damaged one Chiang Kai-shek F-84 aircraft with only six shells in just thirty-two seconds from the time of firing to the time of stopping on the morning of November 24.

    The circular said that the anti-aircraft artillery units stationed in the coastal areas of Fujian shot down and damaged six Chiang Kai-shek planes in November. In addition to the results achieved by the Tiger Head Mountain anti-aircraft artillery, Chiang Kai-shek's planes harassing Dongshan, Weitou, Meihua, and Huangqi Peninsula were damaged by our anti-aircraft artillery four times.

    The circular pointed out that the achievement of these results is due to the fact that commanders at all levels attach great importance to coastal defense preparations, all officers and soldiers diligently study combat techniques, and maintain constant vigilance, thereby using agile and accurate tactical movements to strike at the Chiang Kai-shek planes that come to harass us.

    新华社10日讯　中国人民解放军空军部队首长于7日发出通报，表扬在福建前线虎头山对空作战中击落、击伤蒋机的高射炮兵。
    通报说，中国人民解放军福建前线虎头山上的高射炮兵，在11月24日上午只用六发炮弹、从开火到停火前后只经过三十二秒钟，击落和击伤蒋军F——84型飞机各一架。
    通报说，驻福建沿海地区的高射炮兵部队，在11月份中先后击落、击伤蒋军飞机六架。除虎头山高射炮兵取得的战果外，骚扰我东山、围头、梅花和黄歧半岛等地的蒋机，被我高射炮兵击伤四架。
    通报指出，这些成绩的取得，是由于各级指挥员十分重视沿海的战备工作，全体官兵刻苦地钻研作战技术，并时刻保持警惕性，因此以敏捷和准确的战术动作，打击了前来骚扰的蒋机。
