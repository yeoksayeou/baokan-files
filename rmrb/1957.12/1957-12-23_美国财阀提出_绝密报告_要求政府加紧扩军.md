Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 22nd: The "Washington Post" published on December 20th a "top secret report" submitted to the US National Security Council by an organization called the "Gaither Committee." This report, using the pretext of the Soviet Union's astonishing achievements in science and technology, advocated that the United States should greatly strengthen its military expansion and war preparation plans. The report stated that due to the continuous growth of Soviet military and economic power and the shortcomings of the United States in military and scientific programs, the United States is gradually becoming a "second-rate country" and "facing the most serious military crisis in recent history." The report demanded that the United States greatly strengthen its "preparation for limited wars."

The "Gaither Committee" is a committee composed of a group of entrepreneurs, financiers, scientists, former military personnel, and government officials, headed by Gaither, the former president of the Ford Foundation. Its report was written on the orders of the White House, and the report was submitted four days after the Soviet Union launched its second artificial satellite.

The report divides the US military expansion plan into "top priority tasks and secondary priority tasks." The report said that the "top priority task" for the United States at present is to greatly increase military spending from now until the end of 1970, peaking in 1960 and 1961, increasing military spending by 8 billion US dollars annually from the current 38 billion US dollars. The "secondary priority task" is to allocate another 5 billion US dollars annually to the civil defense shelter program in the next few years.

The report said that the US military plan should focus on "offensive forces" and "greatly strengthen the preparation for limited wars."

The report stated that under the circumstances of military expansion, the US government will not be able to consider tax cuts, the current national debt ceiling must be quickly removed, and the method of increasing taxes should be studied. The report also called for reorganizing the Department of Defense, re-planning the military command system, and the current roles and tasks of the three services.

    美国财阀提出“绝密报告”
    要求政府加紧扩军
    据新华社22日讯  华盛顿消息：“华盛顿邮报”12月20日发表了一个叫做“盖瑟委员会”的组织向美国国家安全委员会提出的一份“绝密报告”，这份报告借口苏联在科学技术方面的惊人成就而鼓吹美国要大大加强扩军备战计划。报告说，由于苏联军事和经济力量的不断增长以及美国在军事和科学计划方面的缺点，美国正在逐渐沦为“二等国家”，“面临着在最近的历史上最严重的军事危机”。报告要求美国要大大加强“有限度战争的准备”。
    “盖瑟委员会”是以前福特基金会主席盖瑟为首的一批企业家、金融家、科学家、前军方人士和政府官员组成的委员会。它的报告是奉白宫的命令编写的，报告在苏联发射第二颗人造卫星后第四天提出。
    报告把美国的扩军计划分为“头等优先任务和二等优先任务”。报告说，美国目前要做的“头等优先任务”是从现在到1970年年底大大增加军费开支，并从1960年和1961年为高峰，使军事开支比目前的三百八十余亿美元每年增加八十亿美元。“二等优先任务”是在今后若干年内每年再拨给民用防避室计划五十亿美元。
    报告说，美国的军事计划要侧重“进攻力量”方面，要“大大加强进行有限度战争的准备”。
    报告说，在扩军的情况下，美国政府将不可能考虑减税，目前的国债最高限额必须很快予以取消，增税的办法应该予以研究。报告还要求改组国防部，重新计划军队指挥系统和三军当前的作用和任务。
