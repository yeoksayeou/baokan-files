Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 16th: The Qingshui River Agricultural Cooperative and Qishi Agricultural Cooperative in Liling County, Yanghua Agricultural Cooperative in Liuyang County, Yangwuqiao Agricultural Cooperative in Hengnan County, Hongmiao Agricultural Cooperative in Qianyang County, Anfu Agricultural Cooperative in Nan County, Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Leiyang County, and Dongshan Collective Farm in Xiangxiang County, all of Hunan Province, which have achieved high grain yields, jointly issued a proposal to agricultural cooperatives throughout the province at the Hunan Provincial Socialist Agricultural Construction Activists Representative Conference on the 11th, calling for the achievement of high grain yields. The proposal was immediately supported by nearly a thousand agricultural cooperative representatives attending the conference, and many agricultural cooperative representatives issued letters of challenge.

The proposal stated that after listening to the reports of responsible comrades from the province and the experiences of representatives of socialist agricultural construction activists from various regions in achieving high grain yields, we have enhanced our ideological understanding and strengthened our determination to achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production next year. Based on the production in 1957, five of our eight cooperatives will achieve an average grain yield of over 1,000 jin per mu in 1958, two cooperatives will reach over 1,300 jin per mu, and the highest, Qishi Cooperative in Liling County, will reach 1,650 jin. The total output of the eight cooperatives will increase by 30% to 50% compared to this year.

When discussing the measures to achieve the above targets, the proposal stated: Four of our eight cooperatives have basically eliminated drought and flood disasters. Through large-scale water conservancy projects this winter, the remaining four cooperatives will also basically eliminate general drought and flood disasters. Currently, members are turning small ponds into large ponds, dry ponds into water ponds, abandoned shallow ponds into fertile fields, changing winding rivers into straight rivers, and turning small ports into large ports. This can expand fertile land by 140 mu and increase grain production by 90,000 jin. At the same time, we also plan to add two water pumps and build two new sluice gates.

Our eight cooperatives have decided that in 1958, the average fertilizer application per mu will be 374 dan, an increase of 1.2 times compared to this year. Currently, approximately 4 million dan of fertilizer have been accumulated, ensuring that over 7 million dan will be accumulated before the Spring Festival. We will do a good job in dredging ditches, draining water, and topdressing the 33,271 mu of green manure that have been planted, with each mu producing 6,000 to 7,000 jin of fresh grass. The number of pigs will increase from 16,444 this year to 33,643, an average of 5.7 pigs per household.

The proposal particularly emphasized increasing the multiple cropping index of farmland: In 1958, none of the 28,375 mu of paddy fields in our eight cooperatives will be single-season. The area of double-season rice will decrease from 11,244 mu to 7,569 mu, and the area of triple-season rice will increase from 16,913 mu to 20,806 mu. Double-cropping rice will expand from 19,195 mu this year to 24,606 mu, accounting for 87% of the total farmland, ensuring that the fields are never idle and the countryside remains green year-round.

At the same time, in 1958, the transplanting of early, mid-, and late-season rice will be advanced by two to three days compared to this year, and all will be densely planted with small seedlings of 77, 67, and 66 cun instead of the current 88 cun. Early and mid-season rice seedlings will be sprayed with pesticide once or twice, and late-season rice seedlings will be sprayed with pesticide two or three times. In order to adapt to the early sowing and transplanting of early rice and the late ripening and harvesting of late rice, to avoid lodging of green manure fields due to strong winds, we will appropriately change to planting double-cropping japonica rice. A season of late rice will also be planted in wheat fields, rapeseed fields, and grass seed fields.

The proposal concluded by calling on all members of agricultural cooperatives throughout the province to take active action and strive for a high grain yield.

Many representatives from various agricultural cooperatives who did not immediately respond stated that they would take the proposal back to their respective cooperatives for discussion and decision, and would immediately respond to this friendly competition.

    湖南农业建设积极分子的豪情壮志
    八个农业社发出粮食丰产倡议书
    千名代表热烈响应　决心实现高产指标
    新华社长沙16日电　湖南省获得粮食高额产量的醴陵县清水江农业社、企石农业社和浏阳县杨花农业社、衡南县扬武桥农业社、黔阳县红庙农业社、南县安福农业社、耒阳县红星农业社、湘乡东山集体农庄，11日在湖南省社会主义农业建设积极分子代表会议上，联合向全省农业社发出为实现粮食高额丰产的倡议书。当场就得到出席大会的近千名农业社代表的支持，并有许多农业社代表发出了应战书。
    倡议书说，我们听了省里各负责同志的报告和各地社会主义农业建设积极分子代表介绍粮食丰产的经验以后，提高了思想认识，坚定了为实现明年农业生产大跃进的决心。我们八个社，在1957年的生产基础上，1958年将有五个社粮食亩产量平均达到一千斤以上，两个社达到一千三百斤以上，最高的醴陵县企石社将达到一千六百五十斤。八个社的总产量，将比今年增加三成到五成。
    倡议书在谈到实现上述指标的措施时说：我们八个社已有四个基本上消灭了水旱灾害，通过今冬大修水利，其余四个社也将基本消灭一般的水旱灾害。现在，社员们正在变小塘为大塘，变干塘为水塘，废浅塘为良田，改弯河为直河，变小港为大港。这样可扩大良田一百四十亩，能增产粮食九万斤。同时，我们还准备添置抽水机两部，新建水闸两座。
    我们八个社决定：1958年平均每亩施肥三百七十四担，比今年增加一点二倍。目前已积肥约四百万担，保证春节前积肥七百多万担。对已种植的三万三千二百七十一亩绿肥，做好疏沟排水和追肥工作，每亩可产鲜草六七千斤。生猪将由今年的一万六千四百四十四头发展到三万三千六百四十三头，平均每户养五点七头。
    倡议书特别强调提高田地复种指数：1958年，我们八个社的二万八千三百七十五亩稻田，已经没有一年一熟的，一年二熟的将由一万一千二百四十四亩降到七千五百六十九亩，一年三熟的将由一万六千九百一十三亩扩大到二万零八百零六亩。双季稻由今年的一万九千一百九十五亩扩大到二万四千六百零六亩，占总田亩的87％，做到四季不闲，田野长青。
    同时，1958年早、中、晚稻都将比今年提早两三天插秧，并一律由今年的八十八寸改为七十七、六十七、六十六寸的小蔸密植。早、中稻秧田喷药一两次，晚稻秧田喷药两三次。为了适应早稻早播早插，晚稻迟熟晚收，以避免自肥田青风倒禾，适当改种双季粳稻。小麦田、油菜田、草子田，也都要种一季晚稻。
    倡议书最后号召全省所有农业社社员，一道积极行动起来，为争取粮食高额丰产而奋斗。
    当场有许多没有应战的各个农业社代表表示将把这倡议书带回各社，讨论决定后立即响应这个友谊竞赛。
