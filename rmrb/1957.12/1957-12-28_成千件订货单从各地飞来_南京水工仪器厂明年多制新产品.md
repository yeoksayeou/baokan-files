Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 27th: The state-owned Nanjing Hydraulic Instrument Factory will produce a large number of new products to support large-scale water conservancy construction throughout the country. Recently, the factory sent order forms to more than 4,000 customers across the country, proposing to produce, trial-produce, and design 56 new products in 1958. By mid-December, the factory had successfully trial-produced 15 new products and put them into production one after another. Among them, most are hydrological instruments needed for the current construction of farmland water conservancy. The 26 new products that the factory has begun to design are all instruments that China could not manufacture in the past and are relatively precise. China's first plankton instrument in 1958 will also be produced in this factory. In addition, in order to meet the sporadic needs of water conservancy construction units across the country, the factory will increase production of 21 small new products. From October to now, telegrams and letters from all over the country requesting the factory to supply hydraulic instruments have been flying in by the thousands from the Northwest Plateau, the Yellow River flood area, river construction sites, and the sea. All factory workers are working day and night to carry out the design, trial production, and various production preparations for new products.

The state-owned Nanjing Hydraulic Instrument Factory was established and developed along with China's water conservancy construction. In the past two years, not only has the variety of new products increased year by year, but also the planning capacity and product quality have gradually improved. Last year, most of the factory's new products were imitations and surveys. Now it undertakes the design and manufacture of hydraulic instruments required by water conservancy units across the country. From August to October this year, the factory sent working groups to visit 207 water conservancy construction units in 19 provinces across the country. The new products designed and manufactured in 1958 were proposed based on the requirements of users across the country.

    成千件订货单从各地飞来
    南京水工仪器厂明年多制新产品
    据新华社南京27日电　国营南京水工仪器厂将出产大量新产品，支援全国各地大规模的水利建设。最近，这个厂向全国四千多个订户发出订货单，提出在1958年中生产、试制和设计五十六种新产品。12月中旬，这个厂已试制成功十五种新产品，并陆续投入生产。其中，多是当前兴修农田水利所需要的水文仪器。这个厂已经开始设计的二十六种新产品，都是我国过去不能制造和较精密的仪器。1958年我国第一部浮游生物仪也将产自这个工厂。此外，这个厂为满足全国各地水利建设单位的零星需要，特增产二十一种小型新产品。从10月份开始至现在，各地要求这个厂供应水工仪器的电报、信件，从西北高原、黄泛区、江河工地和海面上数以千计地飞来，全厂职工正夜以继日地进行新产品的设计、试制和生产的各项准备。
    国营南京水工仪器厂是随着我国水利建设而创建和发展起来的。两年来不仅年年增产新品种，而且计划能力和产品质量也逐渐提高。去年这个厂的新产品多是仿造和测绘的，现在它承担了全国水利单位所需水工仪器的设计和制造任务。今年8至10月，这个厂曾派工作组分别访问了全国十九个省二百零七个水利建设单位。1958年所设计、制造的新产品，就是根据全国用户的要求提出的。
