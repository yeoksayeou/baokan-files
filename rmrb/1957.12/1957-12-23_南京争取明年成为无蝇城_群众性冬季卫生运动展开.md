Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 22nd: The Nanjing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee calls on all citizens and cadres in government offices to work together this winter to eliminate 300,000 sparrows and 300,000 rats each, and 3,300 catties of fly pupae, striving to make Nanjing a fly-free city next year and a "Four-No's" city within five years.

These days, within Nanjing city, one can see groups of people beating gongs and drums, engaging in patriotic health propaganda and cleaning work everywhere. Tens of thousands of Young Pioneers, holding red flags, are on the streets urging pedestrians not to spit indiscriminately. Both urban and suburban areas have organized report meetings and mobilization rallies.

Nanjing's hygiene models and activists in eliminating the "four pests" have played a leading role in this campaign. In addition to introducing their experiences in eliminating the "four pests" to the masses, they have also motivated the people around them to actively participate in the patriotic health movement. Residents of Wulaocun, a national-level hygiene model area, have already carried out a thorough cleanup, with every household taking action to eliminate the four pests. Lu Dama, a national-level hygiene model, took the lead in leading residents to thoroughly clean the area where she lives.

Nanjing's winter patriotic health campaign began around December 15th, with the end of this month being a concentrated stage focusing on eliminating mosquitoes and flies. (Attached Photo)

    南京争取明年成为无蝇城
    群众性冬季卫生运动展开
    据新华社南京22日电  南京市爱国卫生运动委员会要求全市人民和机关干部一起动手，在今年冬天消灭雀、鼠各三十万只，灭蝇蛹三千三百斤，争取南京在明年成为无蝇城，五年内成为“四无”城。
    这几天，南京城内，到处可以看到敲锣打鼓、成群结队的群众在进行爱国卫生的宣传和清洁工作。成千上万的少先队员手执红旗在街上劝阻行人不要随地吐痰。城区和郊区都组织了报告会和动员大会。
    南京市的卫生模范和除“四害”积极分子在这次运动中都发挥了带头作用。他们除向群众介绍自己的除“四害”经验外，还带动周围群众积极投入爱国卫生运动。全国甲等卫生模范地区五老村的居民已举行了一次彻底大扫除，家家户户动手除四害。全国甲等卫生模范鲁大妈带头率领居民对她居住的那个地区进行了彻底清扫。
    南京市的冬季爱国卫生运动是本月15日左右开始的，到本月底为以灭蚊、蝇为重点的突击阶段。（附图片）
