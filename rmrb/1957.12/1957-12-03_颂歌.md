Ode
Ouyang Yuqian

Across ten thousand miles of space, two stars have flown one after the other.
In the serene Moon Palace, someone gently knocks at the door.
Laughing at the Cowherd and Weaver Girl, thousands of years seem but a moment,
While the Soviet Union, in forty autumns, has achieved countless great deeds!
Opening a new era for the world, creating boundless wealth for humanity!
Chinese sons and daughters, young and graceful, their school years not yet full.
Upright and spirited, with soaring ambition, following in the footsteps of Comrade Ding.
The Party steers the helm, the beacon of Marxism-Leninism lights the way.
Breaking through thousands of difficulties, dispelling countless clouds and mists,
Marching straight towards the truth, never hesitating or looking back.
Youth displays wisdom, creation relies on both hands,
See the bright red flag shining over the Divine Land, flowers blooming and wheat flourishing everywhere!

　　颂歌
　　欧阳予倩太空万里，先后两星飞渡。月府清幽，有人轻轻扣户。笑牛女千载悠悠如故，苏联四十春秋，便伟绩丰功无数！开世界之新纪元，创人类无穷财富！中华儿女，年少翩翩，学龄未满三五。挺拔英姿，轩昂志气，随定阿哥步武。党在掌舵领航，马列主义的灯塔照路。冲破千种艰难，驱散万重云雾，直向真理迈进，决无徘徊瞻顾。青春逞智慧，创造凭双手，看红旗明艳照神州，遍地花开麦秀！
