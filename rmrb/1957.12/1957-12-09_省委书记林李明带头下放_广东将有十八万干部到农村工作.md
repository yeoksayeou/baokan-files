    Provincial Party Secretary Lin Liming Takes the Lead in Transferring Downward
    Guangdong to Send 180,000 Cadres to Work in Rural Areas
    Special dispatch from our newspaper, Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 8th. Lin Liming, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and fifty department and bureau chiefs from provincial-level organizations and above will be transferred downward. The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has also decided to simultaneously transfer 180,000 cadres to directly participate in production or work at the grassroots level.
    The Provincial Party Committee announced this decision at the Guangdong Provincial Party Congress, which concluded on the 5th. The Party Congress also called on every Communist Party member, Communist Youth League member, and revolutionary worker in the province to take the lead in going to the mountainous areas and Hainan Island. Currently, many cadres from provincial-level organizations, Guangzhou City, and special districts such as Shaoguan and Shantou are actively discussing registration, and some have already registered, requesting to be transferred downward.
    Guangdong's large-scale transfer of cadres is a major measure to realize agricultural production plans and build a new socialist countryside. According to the recently revised Guangdong agricultural construction plan, by 1967, grain production per mu should reach 900 jin, striving to reach 1,000 jin, becoming a "1,000-jin province." Various cash crops and animal husbandry will also experience several-fold growth. To realize this grand plan, the province's cadre force must be reallocated. Of the 180,000 cadres transferred this time, 150,000 will directly participate in labor production, most of whom will be transferred to mountainous areas and cooperatives lacking labor, and some will go to farms, forestry farms, orchards, livestock farms, aquatic product breeding farms, and agricultural product processing factories; the remaining 30,000 will also be transferred to grassroots units such as townships and communes to strengthen the leadership of agricultural production. Provincial party and government organs will select fifty deputy ministers and department/bureau chiefs or higher to transfer to the organs of the district, special district, and county to participate in leadership work. Provincial Party Secretary Lin Liming has decided to take the lead and go to Hainan Island to strengthen leadership work there. Among the transferred cadres, there are many backbone personnel with rich practical work experience and strong capabilities, but there are also a considerable number of young intellectuals who have not undergone rigorous class struggle tests, have not participated in or have rarely participated in physical labor, and some leading cadres who lack practical work experience. After these cadres undergo physical labor or grassroots work training, they will become a strong cadre force capable of withstanding risks in building socialism.
    Guangdong's large-scale transfer of cadres is also a revolutionary step in implementing the rectification campaign. According to the materials revealed during the rectification campaign, the phenomena of overstaffing, large organizations, and excessive layers in Guangdong's various levels of organs are quite serious. According to statistics, non-productive personnel in the organs account for 2.1% of the province's total population. The Guangdong Provincial Committee believes that this is the fundamental reason why the leading organs become detached from reality and the masses, leading to bureaucratism. This time, the Provincial Committee has made the greatest determination to resolutely shrink the organization and streamline staffing with revolutionary means. It has been initially determined that the Provincial Party Committee organs will merge and consolidate several departments, such as culture and education, finance and trade, politics and law, and border defense, and many of the Provincial People's Committee's organs will also be greatly reduced and merged. The targets for streamlining personnel are: 30% to 40% for provincial-level organs, 22% for district and special district levels, and 15% to 20% for county-level (including districts that have not yet been abolished). Some departments of the provincial-level organs (such as the agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy systems) have also determined that most of the technical personnel should be transferred to the counties and cooperatives to better integrate with production practice.
    Currently, Guangdong is seizing the favorable opportunity of rectification and socialist education to carry out in-depth publicity and mobilization, further resolve the leadership's determination, and open up the cadres' thinking. The relevant departments are making arrangements for the cadres who are transferred to production and preparing production conditions. The Guangdong Provincial Committee requires striving to complete the plan to transfer 180,000 cadres before the spring plowing next year, so that the transferred cadres can catch up with spring plowing production.

### 省委书记林李明带头下放　广东将有十八万干部到农村工作

    省委书记林李明带头下放
　　广东将有十八万干部到农村工作
    本报特约新华社广州8日电中共广东省省委书记林李明和五十个省级机关的厅局长级以上干部将下放。中共广东省委还决定同时下放十八万名干部，直接参加生产或到基层工作。
    在5日结束的中共广东代表大会上，省委宣布了这个决定。党代表大会并号召全省每一个共产党员、共青团员和革命工作人员，都应当带头到山区去，到海南岛去。目前，省级机关、广州市和韶关、汕头等专区的许多干部，正在纷纷酝酿报名，有的已经报名，要求下放。
    广东大批下放干部，是实现农业生产规划、建设社会主义新农村的一项重大措施。根据最近修改了的广东农业建设规划，到1967年，亩产粮食要达到九百斤，争取达到一千斤，成为千斤省。各种经济作物和畜牧业也将有几倍的发展。为了实现这个宏伟的规划，全省的干部力量必须重新调配。此次下放的十八万名干部，就有十五万人直接参加劳动生产，其中大部分下放到山区和缺乏劳动力的合作社去，一部分到农场、林场、果木园、畜牧场、水产养殖场、农产品加工厂去；其余三万名也将下放到乡、社等基层单位，加强农业生产的领导。省级党政机关将抽调五十名副部长和厅局长以上的干部下放到地、专和县的机关参加领导工作。省委书记林李明决定带头去海南岛，以加强该地领导工作。在下放的干部中，有不少是有丰富的实际工作经验和能力较强的骨干，但也有相当一部分是没有经过严格的阶级斗争考验，没有或很少参加过体力劳动的青年知识分子，和一部分缺乏实际工作锻炼的领导干部。这些干部经过体力劳动或基层工作的锻炼后，将成为建设社会主义的一支经得住风险的坚强的干部队伍。
    广东下放大批干部，也是贯彻整风的一个革命的步骤。根据整风中揭露的材料，广东省各级机关人浮于事、机构庞大、层次过多的现象相当严重。据统计，机关非生产人员占全省人口总数的2.1％。广东省委认为，这是领导机关产生脱离实际脱离群众的官僚主义的根本原因。此次省委已下最大的决心，一定要以革命手段，狠狠地紧缩机构，精简编制。初步确定：省委机关将裁并文教、财贸、政法、边防等几个部，省人委的许多机构也将大大裁减和合并。紧缩人员的指标：省一级机关为30％到40％，地、专一级为22％，县一级（包括尚未撤销的区）为15％到20％。省级机关有的部门（如农林水系统），还确定将大部分技术人员下放到县和合作社去，以便更好地和生产实际结合起来。
    目前，广东各地正着手抓紧整风和社会主义教育的有利时机，开展深入的宣传动员，进一步解决领导的决心，打通干部思想。各有关部门正在为下放生产的干部进行安排，准备生产条件。广东省委要求在明年春耕前争取完成下放十八万名干部的计划，使下放干部能赶上春耕生产。
