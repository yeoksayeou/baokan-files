Drafting Plans for Rectification

　　Recently, twenty-one members of the Chinese Communist Party committee in Wangcheng County, Hunan Province, each drafted a rectification plan to go deep among the masses and into reality. The plans were very detailed and specific. Each member planned to do three hundred labor work points next year, and all planned to strive to become experts in a certain aspect of production within a certain period of time. Some people plan to go down to establish high-yield experimental plots to gain experience in high yield and learn and master agricultural technical knowledge; some plan to go deep into pig farms to strive to become pig-raising experts within a year; some want to learn aquaculture, and some want to learn the cultivation techniques of economic crops such as tea trees and orange trees… In short, judging from the plans, the Wangcheng County Party committee members are determined to change their past leadership style of being divorced from reality and go deep down to participate in production and lead production.

　　During the rectification campaign, the masses may raise many opinions about each leader. Faced with the many opinions raised by the masses, how to rectify them and where to start? Perhaps not every leader has a clear idea. A better way is to analyze and study, grasp the core of the masses' opinions, and then formulate specific rectification plans, and do them step by step according to the plans, so that the problems can be corrected more thoroughly. Therefore, the practice of the Wangcheng County Party Committee is worth promoting.

　  订出计划进行整改
    湖南望城县二十一个中共县委委员，最近每个人都订了一个深入群众、深入实际的整改计划。计划订得很详细、很具体。每个委员都计划明年要做三百个劳动工分，都计划争取在一定时间内在生产的某一方面成为内行。有的人准备下去建立千斤丰产试验丘，一方面取得丰产经验，一方面学习掌握农业技术知识；有的人计划深入生猪饲养场，争取一年内成为养猪能手；有的要学会水产养殖，有的要学会茶树、桔子树等经济作物的栽培技术……。总之，从计划看来，望城县的县委委员们，是决心转变过去脱离实际的领导作风，深入下去，参加生产、领导生产的。
    整风期间，群众可能对每一个领导者都会提出不少意见。面对着群众提出的许许多多的意见，究竟怎样来改，从何着手呢？可能并不是每一个领导者都心中有数的。较好的办法，就是经过分析研究，抓住群众意见的核心，然后订出具体的整改的计划，按照计划踏踏实实地做去，毛病就有可能改得比较彻底。因此，望城县委的做法就值得提倡。
