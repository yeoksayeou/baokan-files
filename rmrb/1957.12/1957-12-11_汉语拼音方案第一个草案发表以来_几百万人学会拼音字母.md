    Since the Publication of the First Draft of the Hanyu Pinyin Scheme, Millions of People Have Learned the Pinyin Alphabet

    (Our dispatch) Since the first draft of the Hanyu Pinyin Scheme (namely the original draft) was published by the Chinese Writing Reform Committee in February of last year, millions of people have learned the Pinyin alphabet and are using this scientific phonetic tool to learn Putonghua.

  Since March 1956, Putonghua pronunciation training classes organized by various provinces, cities, and counties have mostly been using the Pinyin alphabet as a tool for teaching and pronunciation correction. Those who originally used the Zhuyin alphabet are also concurrently learning or making up for the Pinyin alphabet. According to statistics from sixteen provinces and cities, 27,493 teachers have already learned the Pinyin alphabet in Beijing pronunciation training classes. To help people learn the Pinyin alphabet, various places have published many Pinyin reading materials. After the Putonghua pronunciation broadcasting teaching lectures held by the Central and various provincial People's Broadcasting Stations in 1956 used the Pinyin alphabet to write teaching materials, more than 2.5 million copies have been distributed. In Beijing, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hubei, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, and other places, a total of 32 kinds of Putonghua textbooks, reading materials, reference books, etc., published using the Pinyin alphabet, have been issued, with a circulation of 2.2 million copies.

    From March to the end of last year, the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, together with some agencies, troops, schools, and cultural centers in Beijing, jointly organized 38 Pinyin alphabet experimental classes, with 3,480 people participating in the learning. Generally, as long as they study for eight to sixteen hours, at most no more than twenty hours, they can understand Putonghua reading materials annotated and spelled with the Pinyin alphabet. Some people can also use the Pinyin alphabet to annotate short Chinese passages with Beijing pronunciation, or use it for taking notes, because the Pinyin alphabet is easy to check and convenient for work.

    In areas where the difference between the local dialect and Beijing pronunciation is large, learning Putonghua with the Pinyin alphabet has also achieved good results. Because the Pinyin alphabet is an alphabet that analyzes phonemes, it is easy to see where the differences between local pronunciation and Beijing pronunciation lie, which is conducive to helping memorize Beijing sounds and correct local dialects.

    汉语拼音方案第一个草案发表以来
    几百万人学会拼音字母
    本报讯　汉语拼音方案的第一个草案（即原草案）在去年2月由中国文字改革委员会发表以来，已有几百万人学会了拼音字母，并且利用这种科学的记音工具学习普通话。
  1956年3月以后，各省市县办的普通话语音训练班，大都试用拼音字母作为教学、正音的工具，原来使用注音字母的，也兼习或补习拼音字母。据十六个省市统计，已经在北京语音训练班中学会拼音字母的教师有二万七千四百九十三人。为了帮助人学习拼音字母，各地出版了许多拼音读物。1956年中央和各省人民广播电台举办的普通话语音广播教学讲座用拼音字母写成教材以后，已经发行二百五十多万册。在北京、浙江、江苏、湖北、广西、四川、云南等地用拼音字母出版的普通话教材、读物、参考书等计有三十二种，发行二百二十万册。
    中国文字改革委员会从去年3月到年底，同在北京的一些机关、部队、学校、文化馆等合办了三十八个拼音字母试验班，有三千四百八十人参加了学习。一般只要学习八个到十六个小时，至多不过二十来个小时，就能看懂用拼音字母注音、拼写的普通话读物。部分人还可以用拼音字母给汉字短文拼注上北京语音，或者用来记笔记，因为拼音字母便于检查，对工作方便。
    在方言和北京语音差别较大的地区，用拼音字母学习普通话，也获得较好成绩。因为拼音字母是分析音素的字母，容易看出地方语音和北京语音差别的所在，有利于帮助记忆北京音和改正方言。
