Comrade Representatives! Dear Friends!

Please allow me to extend the warm greetings of the Confederation of Trade Unions of Yugoslavia to you, and through you, to the Chinese working class and all the people who are deeply and sincerely sympathized with by the Yugoslav people.

The long-term revolutionary struggle, the great determination to sacrifice oneself for the establishment of a regime of the working people, the enormous efforts to transform a backward country into an industrially developed country, and the loyalty to the cause of peace, have linked our two peoples and the working class together and brought us closer.

You probably already know how our people have been watching your decades of revolutionary struggle filled with trials, hardships, and courage. Although our two countries are far apart, we are happy for every achievement you make. We know that this has great significance for the fate of the world, especially for the fate of Asia. We understand the role of the populous Chinese people embarking on the road of socialist construction.

At the same time, China's example is proof to us of the powerful forces unleashed during large-scale social transformation. Because your country is now engaged in a resolute struggle to build a new socialist society in a shorter period of time without going through a hundred years.

We in Yugoslavia are also solving major problems of historical, social, economic, political, and cultural development through socialist revolution and socialist construction. Our experience has convinced us that in a period of great change, people who bear such huge tasks are liberating unprecedented internal forces, which under other conditions are buried.

Therefore, we warmly hope to learn more about the Chinese trade union movement as much as possible, establish closer cooperative relationships, and deepen and expand mutual understanding.

We came to this congress first and foremost with this desire, with this desire for international solidarity.

Whether from the experience of others or from our own experience, we know clearly that trade unions are the most mass organizations of the working class, which occupies a leading position in modern society. It plays an extremely important role in the cause of socialist transformation. Needless to say, the tasks of our trade union organizations are not simple and not easy. At the same time, every society has many internal contradictions in the transition from capitalism to socialism, and also produces many serious problems that must be solved by the trade unions. All these affect the complexity of trade union work, but also affect the particularity of the nature and role of trade unions. The current characteristic of the world is that the significance of trade unions is constantly increasing in a wide social scope. At the same time, due to the imbalance of social development and the difference in social structural forms, trade unions also have increasingly new and unique characteristics.

In Yugoslavia in recent times, profound changes have taken place in the nature, role, and working methods of trade unions—these changes have occurred after the implementation of worker committees within enterprises and the implementation of the social autonomy system, one of the important principles of our social structure. In view of the fact that the workers' committee is not only a manifestation of the change in the management method of the national economy, a manifestation of the direct producers themselves replacing the administrative leadership organs, but also a qualitative leap in the development of socialist social relations, expanding the basic power of the workers. Therefore, trade unions should inevitably adapt to this change. Some people believe that the role of trade unions will be weakened and reduced under these conditions, but our opinion is the opposite. Our experience points out that autonomous organs and trade unions cannot be replaced, and practice also prompts us to seek new functions of trade unions and move forward along the road of continuously expanding the activities of these institutions. This is not only conducive to realizing the management power of workers, but also conducive to ensuring the material, socio-economic, cultural requirements and needs of the working class.

The variable development of our trade unions requires us to understand the experiences of other countries as comprehensively as possible. This is one of the important conditions for successfully overcoming difficulties and enriching the experience of the international trade union movement.

I believe that the leaders of the Chinese trade unions will agree with my opinion that the connection between us is beneficial and fruitful to both parties. All the conditions are available, mainly because both parties have expressed their willingness to further continue our cooperation, continue to freely exchange opinions, and more creatively connect them with the most important issues of modern mankind, especially the international workers' movement. These issues are: easing the tension in relations between countries, disarmament, peaceful utilization of atomic energy, carrying out the anti-colonialist struggle, assisting economically backward countries, improving the living standards of the working people, protecting social rights, bringing trade union organizations closer to each other in the broadest world scope, guaranteeing the basic power of producers, implementing the principle of true pay according to work, guaranteeing democratic rights, etc. There is no doubt that these issues and this form of cooperation, in a broad sense, are not only the direct interests of the international trade union movement and the international struggle for socialism, but also, indisputably, beneficial to the trade unions of our two countries.

Finally, I would like to express my happiness at being able to visit your country, and congratulate you on achieving further success in the arduous and historically significant, and the most noble cause that our generation can shoulder, the cause of building a classless and free socialist society.

### 南斯拉夫工会联合会中央理事会主席  萨拉伊致词

　　南斯拉夫工会联合会中央理事会主席
    萨拉伊致词代表同志们！亲爱的朋友们！
    请允许我向你们，并且通过你们，向南斯拉夫人民寄予深切和真挚同情的中国工人阶级与全体人民，转达南斯拉夫工会联合会的热烈敬礼。
    长期的革命斗争，为争取建立劳动人民政权而自我牺牲的伟大决心，将落后国家改造为工业发达的国家的巨大努力，对和平事业的忠诚，将我们两国人民与工人阶级联结起来，并且使我们接近了。
    你们大概已经知道，我国人民是如何注视着你们数十年来充满了考验、艰难和果敢的革命斗争。尽管我们两国相离很远，但是我们对你们的每项成就都感到高兴。我们知道，这对全世界的命运，特别是对亚洲的命运有着巨大的意义。我们了解走向社会主义建设道路的、人口众多的中国人民的作用。
    同时，中国的榜样对我们来讲，是在大规模的社会改造过程中解放了强大力量的证明。因为你们的国家现在正进行着坚决的斗争，争取在较短的时期内而无需经过一百年就建成新的社会主义社会。
    我们南斯拉夫现在也正在通过社会主义革命和社会主义建设来解决历史、社会、经济、政治及文化发展的重大问题。我们的经验使我们相信，在伟大的变革时期里，肩负着如此巨大任务的人民正在解放着空前的内部力量，在其它条件下，这种力量是被埋没着的。
    因此，我们热烈地希望尽可能更好地了解中国的工会运动，建立更紧密的合作关系，加深和扩大相互了解。
    我们来参加这次大会首先就是本着这种愿望，本着我们这种要求国际团结的愿望的。
    我们不论从别人的经验或自己的经验中都清楚地知道，工会是现代社会中处于主导地位的工人阶级最具有群众性的组织。它在社会主义改造事业中起着极重要的作用。不言而喻，我们工会组织的任务是不简单的，是不容易的。同时，每一个社会由资本主义过渡到社会主义时，都有很多的内部矛盾，并且也产生许多必须由工会参加解决的严重问题。所有这些都影响到工会工作的复杂性，同时也影响到工会性质和作用的特殊性。目前世界的特点是：工会的意义在广泛的社会范围内不断地增长。同时，由于社会发展的不平衡，社会结构形式的不同，工会也具有愈来愈新的独特的特点。
    最近一个时期在南斯拉夫，工会的性质、作用及工作方法等方面都发生了深深的变化——这些变化是在企业内部实行工人委员会，实行我国社会结构的重要原则之一的社会自治制度之后发生的。鉴于工人委员会不仅是国民经济管理方式起了变化的表现，是直接生产者本人代替了行政领导机关的表现，而且也是社会主义社会关系发展中的质的跃进，扩大了工人的基本权力的表现。因此，工会不可避免地应当适合这种变化。有人认为在这种条件下工会的作用会削弱和缩小，我们的意见相反。我们的经验指出，自治机关和工会是不可能被代替的，而实践也促使我们来寻求工会的新的职能，沿着不断扩大这些机构的活动的道路前进。这不仅有利于实现工人的管理权力，而且也有利于保证工人阶级在物质、社会经济及文化方面的要求和需要。
    我国工会变动性的发展要求我们尽可能地全面了解其它国家的经验。这是顺利克服困难和丰富国际工会运动经验的重要条件之一。
    我相信中国工会的领导人员会同意我这样的意见，即我们之间的联系对双方都是有益和有成效的。一切条件都具备了，主要是双方都表示了愿望，希望进一步继续我们的合作，继续自由交换意见，更创造性地把它们和现代人类的、特别是和国际工人运动中最重大的问题联系起来。这些问题就是：缓和各国关系上的紧张状态，裁减军备，和平利用原子能，进行反殖民主义的斗争，援助经济落后国家，提高劳动人民生活水平，保卫社会权利，在最广泛的世界范围内使工会组织相互接近，保证生产者的基本权力，实行真正的按劳付酬原则，保障民主权利等。毫无疑问，这些问题和这种形式的合作，就广义而言，不仅是国际工会运动和争取社会主义的国际斗争的直接利益，而且，不容争辩地，对我们两国工会也都有好处。
    最后，我想向你们表示我能有机会访问你们国家的高兴心情，祝贺你们在艰巨的、同时有着历史意义的、我们这一辈人所能肩负的最崇高的事业中，在建设没有阶级的、自由的社会主义社会的事业中，取得进一步的成就。
