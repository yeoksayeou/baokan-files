    Chongqing Districts' People's Committees
    Seriously Handle Opinions of Factory and Mine Workers

    (By our newspaper) Chongqing's district People's Committees have conscientiously addressed opinions raised by factory and mine workers regarding various aspects of the government's work.

    During the "blooming and contending" period, workers in Jiulongpo District submitted over four thousand suggestions to the district People's Committee, covering finance, economics, culture, education, health, and cadre work style. The district People's Committee immediately assigned eighteen cadres to form four working groups to handle these suggestions. For example, workers reflected that vegetable prices were too high and buying vegetables was inconvenient. The district People's Committee implemented negotiated pricing in all vegetable markets, established more vegetable stalls, and strengthened market management. Based on the opinions of workers at the Chongqing Power Plant, additional pork supply points were set up near the plant. According to the suggestions of workers, the Nan'an District People's Committee instructed commercial departments to strictly prohibit the practice of bundling ducks and preserved eggs with eggs and pork when the public purchased them, a practice that had aroused widespread opposition from the masses. It was also stipulated that temporary pork supply points should be added during the three days when workers received their salaries, or during festivals, and the rice selling time should be extended to reduce queuing, crowding, and wasting workers' time. During the rectification period, Chongqing Third Steel Company invited the Jiangbei District commercial departments to jointly formulate a plan to improve market management, non-staple food supply, and the service attitude of canteen staff. To ensure vegetable supply and stabilize prices, the commercial departments, in addition to dispatching cadres to strengthen market management and educate farmers and vendors to refrain from raising prices and selling inferior goods, also signed supply and sales contracts with nearby agricultural cooperatives, stipulating prices.

    The district People's Committees have also addressed issues raised by workers regarding the blind influx of farmers into cities, marriage registration, and grain supply.

    重庆各区人民委员会
    认真处理厂矿职工的意见
    本报讯  重庆各区人民委员会认真处理了厂矿职工提出的有关政府各项工作的意见。
    九龙坡区职工在鸣放期间给区人委提出了包括财经、文教、卫生以及干部作风等四千多条意见。区人民委员会立即抽调十八个干部，组成四个工作组，分别加以处理。例如，职工们反映，蔬菜的价格偏高，买菜不方便。区人民委员会在各菜市场实行议价，增设了菜站，加强市场管理。根据重庆发电厂职工的意见，在这个厂附近增设了猪肉供应点。南岸区人民委员会根据职工的意见，指示商业部门在群众购买鸡蛋、猪肉时，严格禁止搭配鸭子、皮蛋。这件事曾引起广大群众的反对。并且规定在职工发薪的三天内，或节日，增设临时的猪肉供应点，延长售米时间，以减少排队、拥挤，浪费职工时间的现象。重庆第三钢铁公司在整改期间邀请江北区商业部门共同拟定改进市场管理，副食品供应，食堂人员服务态度的方案。为了保证蔬菜供应，稳定价格，商业部门除抽调干部加强市场管理，教育农民、小贩不许哄抬价格，以劣充好外，并和附近农业社签订了供销合同，规定了价格。
    各区人民委员会对职工提出的关于农民盲目流入城市，婚姻登记，粮食供应等问题，也都作了处理。
