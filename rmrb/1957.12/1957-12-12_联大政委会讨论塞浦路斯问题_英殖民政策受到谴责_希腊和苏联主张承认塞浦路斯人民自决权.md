Xinhua News Agency, December 11th: TASS, New York reports: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee began discussing the Cyprus issue on December 9th.

    British representative Noble, at the morning meeting, repeated the old tune of colonial powers, portraying the matter as if the root of the Cyprus issue was not the struggle between British imperialism and the Greek residents of Cyprus against colonial enslavement, but a dispute between Greece and Turkey. Britain, he claimed, was merely trying to ensure that the legitimate interests of "all parties concerned" were respected in this dispute.
    Noble also emphasized Britain's "strategic interests" in Cyprus.
    Greek Foreign Minister Averoff spoke next. He stated that, according to materials from Britain's most recent population survey, Greeks constitute 80% of the Cypriot population. He emphasized that Turkey, which has no connection to the Cyprus issue, was forcibly brought in by Britain to obstruct the achievement of a solution favorable to the Cypriot people.
    Averoff stressed that the United Nations General Assembly could not refuse to support the national demands of the Cypriot people, otherwise it would be tantamount to allowing colonial enslavement to continue.
    The Greek representative cited facts to prove that Britain had not implemented the recommendations of the 11th session of the United Nations General Assembly regarding the creation of a peaceful and free atmosphere necessary for resolving the Cyprus issue.
    Referring to Britain's proposal for "negotiations," the Greek representative said that in order for the negotiations to succeed, Britain must recognize the Cypriot people's right to self-determination. He pointed out that the "constitution" and autonomy proposed by Britain were merely a guise for maintaining the colonial system.
    The Greek representative formally submitted a proposal expressing concern that no progress had been made in resolving the Cyprus issue and hoping "to allow the Cypriot people the opportunity to determine their future by exercising their right to self-determination." He called on all representatives to support this proposal.
    Soviet representative Pevy spoke at the afternoon meeting. He emphasized that the British authorities spare no effort to maintain the colonial regime in Cyprus at any cost, and have taken measures of persecution against Cypriot patriots and the entire Cypriot people for this purpose. Pevy said that the British ruling clique has been trying to turn Cyprus into its base in order to safeguard the interests of British monopoly capital in the Middle East.
    Pevy said that world public opinion insists on an end to the atrocities in Cyprus, the abolition of all emergency laws, the release of political prisoners, and the restoration of all democratic rights to the Cypriots.
    Pevy accused the British government of failing to take the necessary measures to promote a peaceful solution to the Cyprus issue based on the recognition of the Cypriots' inalienable right to self-determination. He also exposed various Western conspiracies, such as the attempt to divide Cyprus into Greek and Turkish parts while retaining British military bases on the island, and granting Cyprus "independence" under the protection of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. These are related to plans to turn the island of Cyprus into a military base and nuclear base. At the same time, the United States is also bent on establishing its own air force and missile bases in Cyprus in order to use the island of Cyprus to implement its aggressive plans in the Middle East formulated according to the Eisenhower-Dulles Doctrine.
    Pevy finally emphasized that recognizing the Cypriot people's right to self-determination is the only realistic path that can lead to the resolution of the Cyprus issue. It is impossible to expect the freedom-loving Cypriot people to agree to decisions made behind their backs and against their vital interests.
    Turkish representative Sarper also spoke at the afternoon meeting. He adopted a position of defending British colonialism.

### 联大政委会讨论塞浦路斯问题  英殖民政策受到谴责  希腊和苏联主张承认塞浦路斯人民自决权

    联大政委会讨论塞浦路斯问题
    英殖民政策受到谴责
    希腊和苏联主张承认塞浦路斯人民自决权
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会9日开始讨论塞浦路斯问题。
    英国代表诺布耳在上午会议上重弹殖民国家的老调，他把事情说成好像塞浦路斯问题的根源不是英国帝国主义和反对殖民奴役的塞浦路斯的希腊居民之间的斗争，而是希腊和土耳其之间的纠纷，而英国在这场纠纷中似乎只是在尽力使“一切有关方面”的合法利益都受到尊重。
    诺布耳还强调英国在塞浦路斯保有“战略利益”。
    希腊外交大臣阿维罗夫接着发言。他说，根据英国最近一次人口调查的材料，希腊人占塞浦路斯居民80％。他强调指出，同塞浦路斯问题没有任何关系的土耳其，被英国生硬地拉进来，以阻挠取得有利于塞浦路斯人民的解决办法。
    阿维罗夫着重指出，联合国大会不能拒绝支持塞浦路斯人民的民族要求，否则这就等于允许殖民奴役继续存在。
    这位希腊代表列举一些事实来证明英国并没有执行联合国大会第十一届会议关于创造解决塞浦路斯问题所必需的和平自由气氛的建议。
  希腊代表谈到英国的“谈判”建议时说，为了使谈判取得成就，英国必须承认塞浦路斯人民的自决权利。他指出，英国提出的“宪法”和自治不过是保持殖民主义制度的幌子。
    希腊代表正式提出了一项提案，提案对塞浦路斯问题的解决没有获得任何进展表示耽心，并且希望“让塞浦路斯人民有可能利用自己的自决权来确定自己的前途”。他呼吁全体代表支持这个提案。
    苏联代表佩维在下午会议上发言。他着重指出，英国当局不惜以任何代价来保持在塞浦路斯的殖民主义政权，并且为了这个目的而对塞浦路斯爱国人士和全体塞浦路斯人民采取了迫害手段。佩维说，英国统治集团一直竭力要把塞浦路斯变为自己的根据地，以维护英国垄断资本在中近东的利益。
    佩维说，全世界的舆论都坚持要求停止在塞浦路斯的暴行，废除各项紧急法，释放政治犯，恢复塞浦路斯人的一切民主权利。
    佩维指责英国政府没有采取必要的措施来促使塞浦路斯问题在承认塞浦路斯人有不可剥夺的自决权的基础上获得和平解决。他并且揭露了西方的种种阴谋，例如，企图在保留岛上的英国军事基地的条件下把塞浦路斯分为希腊部分和土耳其部分，给予塞浦路斯在北大西洋公约组织保护下的“独立”等等。这些都同变塞浦路斯岛为军事根据地和原子基地的计划有关。同时，美国也一心想在塞浦路斯建立自己的空军基地和导弹基地，以便利用塞浦路斯岛来实现根据艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯主义制订的在中近东的侵略计划。
    佩维最后强调说，承认塞浦路斯人民的自决权，是可能导致解决塞浦路斯问题的唯一的现实道路。根本不可能期待爱好自由的塞浦路斯人民会同意背着它做出的和违背它的切身利益的决议。
    在下午会议上发言的还有土耳其代表萨佩尔。他采取了维护英国殖民主义的立场。
