Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou Electric Dispatch: Zhejiang Province has initially determined to transfer more than 100,000 cadres to labor production posts and grassroots work posts, and currently about 40,000 cadres have already been transferred downward. This was stated by Huo Shilian, Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in a report to more than 1,000 leading cadres and key members of provincial-level organs on the 20th.

Huo Shilian said that the provincial-level organs and all county-level and higher organs in the province are actively carrying out the work of transferring cadres downward. Cadres in the provincial-level organs are forming a surge of enthusiasm for registering to go up the mountains and down to the sea to settle down and engage in labor production. Many units have formulated plans for streamlining institutions and transferring cadres downward, preparing to transfer 40% to 60% of all cadres. The downward transfer of cadres should be thorough, not layered. He also requested that the work of streamlining institutions and transferring cadres downward be completed within the next six months.

Among the 40,000 cadres transferred downward by Zhejiang Province in the first half of this year, more than 13,000 have been directly transferred to production posts. Among them, there are 328 cadres at the division-chief level or above, and 2,353 county-level cadres, most of whom are the backbone of leading cadres at all levels. After their downward transfer, they have strengthened and enriched the leadership work at the lower and grassroots levels, especially at the county and township levels. Across the province, 3,082 transferred cadres have served as township Party branch secretaries and township heads, and 87 have served as county Party committee secretaries and county heads.

    浙江初步确定下放十万干部
    新华社杭州电　浙江省初步确定下放十万名以上的干部到劳动生产岗位和基层工作岗位，目前已经下放的干部有四万名左右。这是中共浙江省委书记霍士廉20日向省级机关一千多名领导干部、骨干分子所作的报告中说的。
    霍士廉说，目前省级机关和全省县以上机关正在积极进行干部下放工作，省级机关干部正在形成报名要求上山下海安家落户进行劳动生产的热潮，很多单位已制订出紧缩机构、下放干部的方案，准备下放的干部占全体干部的40％到60％。下放干部要一放到底，不要层层下放。他还要求紧缩机构、下放干部的工作要在今后半年内完成。
    浙江省今年上半年已经下放的四万名干部中，有一万三千多人直接下放到生产岗位。其中处长级以上干部有三百二十八人，县级干部二千三百五十三人，他们大多是各级领导干部中的骨干。他们下放后都加强和充实了下层、基层特别是县和乡两级的领导工作，全省下放干部担任乡党支部书记、乡长的就有三千零八十二人，担任县委书记、县长的有八十七人。
