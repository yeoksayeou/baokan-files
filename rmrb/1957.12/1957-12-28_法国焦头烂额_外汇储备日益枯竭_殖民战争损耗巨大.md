Xinhua News Agency, December 28th -- A United Press dispatch from Paris on the 22nd stated that as 1957 draws to a close, "France is at the most distressing crossroads since the end of the Indochina War."

The message pointed out that the longest government crisis since the end of World War II (thirty-six days) only ended in early November, and now, "prices are ominously rising again, foreign exchange reserves are dwindling, and the Algerian war continues to drain its vitality."

The message said: "To successfully overcome the foreign exchange crisis, France is striving to secure a loan of 400 million U.S. dollars. The cause of this crisis is that before October, France's imports were as high as one and a half times its exports. However, unless the situation of spending 1.7 billion U.S. dollars annually on the Algerian war can be stopped, it will be difficult for France to obtain this loan."

The message continued to point out that the Algerian war is still continuing unrestrained. France's powerful "police measures" cannot suppress the armed resistance in Algeria. "Four hundred thousand French youths are still performing the arduous task of 'pacification' without returning to their classrooms and workshops," while the Algerian national liberation struggle has received extensive support. Among the 300,000 Algerians in Paris, Lille, Marseille, and other places, many are "donating funds or actively participating in activities."

### 法国焦头烂额  外汇储备日益枯竭  殖民战争损耗巨大

    法国焦头烂额
    外汇储备日益枯竭
    殖民战争损耗巨大
    新华社28日讯　合众社22日从巴黎发出的一条电讯说，在这1957年即将结束之际，“法国正处在印度支那战争结束以来最使人焦头烂额的十字路口”。
    这条消息指出，第二次世界大战结束以来最长的一次政府危机（三十六天）在11月初才告结束，而现在，“物价又在不祥地上涨，外汇储备日益枯竭，阿尔及利亚战争仍旧在损伤着它的元气”。
    消息说：“为了顺利渡过外汇上的危机，法国正在竭力争取一笔四亿美元的贷款。造成这一危机的原因是由于10月份以前法国的进口数一直高达出口数的一倍半。但是，除非每年在阿尔及利亚战争中耗费十七亿美元的情况能够停止，否则法国将很难得到这笔贷款。”
    消息接着指出，然而阿尔及利亚战争仍然毫无节制地在继续进行。法国的强力“警察措施”并不能把阿尔及利亚的武装反抗镇压下去。“四十万法国青年仍然在执行着‘绥靖’的苦差事，而没有回到他们的教室和工作房”，而阿尔及利亚民族解放斗争却得到广大的支持，在巴黎、里尔、马赛等地的三十万阿尔及利亚人中，许许多多人都“捐助经费，或者积极参加活动”。
