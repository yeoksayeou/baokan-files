Welcoming a New Upsurge in National Soil and Water Conservation
——Notes from the Second National Soil and Water Conservation Work Conference
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhao Qi

Is the area of soil erosion in China today more than twice the size of France? Can such a large area of erosion be basically controlled in the next ten years? Representatives from various regions gave affirmative answers in their speeches at the Second National Soil and Water Conservation Work Conference. Twenty-three exemplary reports were inspiring. Representatives from Gansu stated their intention to promote 10,000 "Dengjia Forts" next year, while the Tai'an Prefecture in Shandong Province aimed to promote four "Mang Rivers" within three years. The Yanbei Prefecture in Shanxi Province requested that every one of its 1,500 agricultural cooperatives should have a "Daquan Mountain."

Dare to Think Big, Work Practically

Wushan County in Gansu Province, which saw the emergence of 109 "Dengjia Forts" this year, presented a brilliant five-year plan to the conference: to basically achieve afforestation throughout the county next year; to basically achieve water conservancy by 1959; to basically control soil and water loss by 1960; and to basically achieve electrification by 1962. Once this plan is completed, the county will have an average of more than 2,000 jin of grain per person, and other income, mainly from forests and orchards, will reach more than 100 yuan, with the people's living standards exceeding those of well-to-do middle peasants by two to three times. The county magistrate, when talking about their guiding ideology, said: "We closely combine daring to think big with being realistic."

Not Come Down the Mountain Until the Mountain is Healed

"We are determined to use the same determination as in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to complete the task of harnessing all 913 barren mountains in the county next year, and to lay the foundation for the complete completion of all river management projects in the county by 1960." This was the determination expressed by the county magistrate of Yuxian County in Henan Province to the conference. The county has decided that the county party secretary, the county magistrate, and ten county-level cadres will each lead 783 cadres, carrying their luggage up the mountains, and will not come down until the mountains are healed. The county has also accepted the request from the people in the plains area to support the mountainous areas and has organized volunteer shock brigades, with more than 8,000 people now on the mountains. Their slogans are: three guarantees (guarantee of the mountain top, guarantee of quality, guarantee of time), ten brings (grain coupons, cooking utensils, tools, stonemasons, blacksmiths, carpenters, tree seeds, doctors, teachers, books), and one assurance (completion of the task). To heal the barren mountains, the masses in this county have already invested more than 80,000 yuan themselves.

The Situation Promotes Progress

Representatives from various regions believe that the conditions for launching a larger-scale soil and water conservation movement are ripe. These conditions are: agricultural cooperation has been achieved; the socialist education movement is being carried out in rural areas; the promulgation of the Forty Articles of the National Programme for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft); the great upsurge in production has begun; there is rich experience in soil and water conservation; a nationwide wave of cadres going to the countryside and up the mountains is rising; and, in particular, more and more new records of achieving "four, five, eight" have been achieved, and without doing a good job in soil and water conservation, there is no way to catch up. Some representatives from some regions reviewed their past erroneous thinking of not paying enough attention to soil and water conservation, especially some representatives from southern regions reviewed their complacency of thinking that soil erosion in the south was "not serious" and that there was nothing to do in soil and water conservation.

Gao Jincai's Ideal

Gao Jincai, who has made significant contributions to soil and water conservation, is now the director of the nationally renowned Daquan Mountain Agricultural Cooperative. His typical speech at this conference was warmly welcomed by representatives from various regions. He also announced to the conference the action slogan of the Daquan Mountain Agricultural Cooperative for the next five years: "Turn barren mountains into orchards, turn slopes and gullies into good farmland, eat bread and wear silk, have milk and honey as everyday meals, apples in the gullies will never be sold out, cooperative members will not worry about eating and wearing, there will be cultural entertainment and a library, and women in the plains must go up the mountains." The changes in Daquan Mountain show that by relying on cooperatives and combining the current and long-term interests of the masses, soil and water conservation will form a lasting and conscious mass movement.

Let the bare mountain slopes, which have been bare for thousands of years, be re-clothed in green; let the mountain ponds and reservoirs shine like stars in the sky; let the belts of trees form arrays and spread all over the mountains and fields; let fish-scale pits, contour trenches, check dams, field ridges, water cellars, terraces, and canals be interwoven into a net of heaven and earth. At that time, from the watershed to the slopes and gullies, from the tributaries to the great rivers, from the deep mountains, shallow mountains to the hills, plains, and low-lying areas, every drop of water must be stored, and every inch of soil must be retained, so that water and soil will always serve production and benefit the people.

This is Gao Jincai's ideal, and it is also the ideal of all participants and the people of the whole country.

    迎接全国水土保持新高潮
    ——第二次全国水土保持工作会议散记
    新华社记者　赵奇
    我国现有水土流失面积，比法国面积大一倍还多？在今后十年内，能不能够将这样大的流失面积基本控制起来呢？各地代表在第二次全国水土保持工作会议上的发言作了肯定的答复。二十三个典型报告激动人心，甘肃代表表示要在明年推广一万个“邓家堡”，山东泰安专区要在三年内推广四条“漭河”，山西雁北专区要求一千五百个农业社社社出现“大泉山”。
    大胆地想，实事求是地干
    在今年一年内出现一百零九个“邓家堡”的甘肃武山县，向会议提出了灿烂的五年规划，明年基本实现全县绿化；1959年基本实现水利化；1960年基本控制水土流失；1962年基本实现电气化。这个规划完成后，全县每人平均有粮食二千多斤，以林木、果园为主的其他收入将达一百元以上，人民生活水平将超过富裕中农两三倍。该县县长谈到他们的领导思想时说：“我们是把大胆地想和实事求是紧密结合起来的。”
    不治好山不下山
    “坚决用抗美援朝那样的决心，明年完成全县九百一十三座荒山的治理任务，为1960年彻底完成全县所有河道治理工程打下基础。”这是河南禹县县长向会议表示的决心。该县已经决定，县委书记、县长各一人和十个县级干部，分头带领七百八十三个干部背上行李上山，山不治好不下山。这个县还接受平原地区人民支援山区的要求，组织志愿突击队，现在已有八千多人上山，他们的口号是：三包（包山头、包质量、包时间）、十带（粮票、炊具、工具、石匠、铁匠、木匠、树种、医生、老师、书本）和一保证（完成任务）。为治好荒山，现在这个县的群众已经自己投资八万多元。
    形势促人前进
    各地代表认为开展规模更大的水土保持运动的条件已经成熟，这就是：农业已经合作化；农村进行的社会主义教育运动；农业发展纲要（修正草案）四十条的发布；生产大高潮已经开始；有丰富的搞水土保持的经验；全国干部下乡上山的浪潮风起云涌；特别是实现“四、五、八”的新纪录越来越多，不搞好水土保持，就没法赶上去。有些地区的代表在会上检查了过去对水土保持不够重视的错误思想，特别是有些南方地区的代表检查了认为南方水土流失“不严重”，认为水土保持没啥可搞的自满情绪。
    高进才的理想
    对水土保持事业有重大贡献的高进才，现在是闻名全国的大泉山农业社的社长，他在这次会议上的典型发言，受到各地代表的热烈欢迎，他向会议还宣布了大泉山农业社今后五年的行动口号：“干山变成花果山，坡沟变成好良田，吃面包、穿丝棉，牛奶蜂蜜家常饭，沟里苹果卖不完，社员不愁吃和穿，文化娱乐图书馆，川内妇女要上山。”大泉山的变化，说明了依靠合作社，把群众当前利益和长远利益结合起来，水土保持就会形成持久的自觉的群众性运动。
    让千百年来光秃的山坡重新穿上绿色的衣裳；让山塘、水库像满天繁星一样地闪灼发光；让绿荫成阵的林带漫山遍野；让鱼鳞坑、水平沟、谷坊、地埂、水窖、梯田、渠道交织成天罗地网。那时，从分水岭到坡沟，从支流到大河，从深山、浅山到丘陵、平原、洼地，杯水必蓄，寸土必留，使水和土永远为生产服务，为人民造福。
    这是高进才的理想，也是所有与会者和全国人民的理想。
