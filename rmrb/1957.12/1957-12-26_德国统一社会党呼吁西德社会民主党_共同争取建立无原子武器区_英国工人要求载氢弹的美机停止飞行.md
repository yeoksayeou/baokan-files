Xinhua News Agency, December 25th - According to a Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA) report from Berlin on December 24th: The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany has written to the Social Democratic Party of West Germany regarding the results of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Paris meeting. The letter suggests taking joint steps to realize the plan for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe.

The letter points out that the NATO Council meeting in Paris adopted, in principle, a resolution on establishing nuclear weapon and rocket weapon storage depots and rocket launch sites in Western European countries—including West German territory. This practice will make the reunification of Germany impossible. At the same time, the letter also points out the danger to West German residents of equipping the West German army with nuclear weapons and establishing rocket bases in West Germany. The letter states that, in order to implement a practical policy, it is necessary to prevent West Germany from being armed with atomic weapons and to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, including the two Germanys, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. This would be a major contribution to easing international tensions and safeguarding peace in Europe.

The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany points out that the Soviet Union's willingness to reach mutual understanding and the suggestions made by Bulganin in his letter to Chancellor Adenauer have aroused widespread reaction among the world public.

All circumstances prove that as long as the workers' parties and various organizations in Germany establish cooperation, there is now a practical possibility in West Germany to launch a large-scale mass movement to defend peace.

The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany suggests that the Social Democratic Party of Germany jointly and proactively organize mass rallies throughout Germany to discuss the issue of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe.

The letter was signed by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

Xinhua News Agency, December 25th - According to TASS, London, December 24th: The British public continues to oppose American planes carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs flying over British airspace.

The Executive Committee of the United Patternmakers Association demanded on the 23rd that these dangerous flights be stopped immediately.

The Scottish Mineworkers' Union has called on the Scottish Committee of the Labour Party and the Supreme Council of the Scottish Trades Union Congress to convene a special meeting to oppose the flight of American bombers in Britain and the establishment of rocket weapon bases in Britain.

One hundred and nine representatives from the Yorkshire coal mining area, representing 138,000 miners, unanimously passed a resolution calling for a high-level conference aimed at stopping the testing of hydrogen weapons.

The prominent British peace movement activist, the Dean of Canterbury, Johnson, published an article in the "Daily Worker" advocating that Western countries not reject the peace proposals put forward by the Soviet Union.

Johnson wrote: We cannot allow planes carrying bombs that are sufficient to destroy us and destroy the whole world to circle over our heads. We should do everything possible to eliminate this deadly threat.

    德国统一社会党呼吁西德社会民主党
    共同争取建立无原子武器区
    英国工人要求载氢弹的美机停止飞行
    新华社25日讯　据德意志通讯社柏林24日消息：德国统一社会党中央委员会就北大西洋集团巴黎会议的结果写信给德国社会民主党。这封信建议为实现欧洲无原子武器地区的计划而采取共同步骤。
    这封信指出，北大西洋公约组织理事会巴黎会议通过了关于在西欧各国——其中包括在西德领土上建立原子武器和火箭武器储存库和火箭发射基地的原则性决议，这种做法将使重新统一德国成为不可能。同时信中还指出以核武器装备西德军队和在西德建立火箭基地对于西德居民的危险。信中说，为了要执行切合实际的政策，必须阻止以原子武器武装西德，并且在中欧建立包括两个德国、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克在内的无原子武器地区。这将是对缓和国际紧张局势和保障欧洲和平的重大贡献。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会指出，苏联表示愿意达成互相谅解的态度和布尔加宁在给阿登纳总理的信中所提出的建议在世界公众中引起普遍的反应。
    一切情况证明，只要工人的政党和全德的各种组织建立合作，现在在西德也有实际的可能来展开保卫和平的大规模群众运动。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会建议德国社会民主党共同主动地在全德范围内组织群众集会来讨论在欧洲建立无原子武器地区的问题。
    在信上签名的是德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希。
    据新华社25日讯　据塔斯社伦敦24日讯：英国公众继续反对带着原子弹和氢弹的美国飞机在英国上空飞行。
    英国翻砂工人联合会执行委员会23日要求立刻停止这种危险的飞行。
    苏格兰矿工工会要求工党苏格兰委员会和苏格兰职工大会最高委员会召开特别会议，反对美国轰炸机在英国飞行和在英国建立火箭武器基地。
    拥有十三万八千名矿工的约克郡煤矿区的一百零九位代表一致通过一项决议，要求举行目的在于停止试验氢武器的高级会议。
    著名英国和平运动活动家坎特伯雷教长约翰逊在“工人日报”上发表文章，主张西方国家不要拒绝苏联所提出的有关和平的建议。
    约翰逊写道：我们不能允许那些携带着足以毁灭我们和毁灭全世界的炸弹的飞机在我们头顶上盘旋。我们应该尽一切力量来消除这种致命的威胁。
