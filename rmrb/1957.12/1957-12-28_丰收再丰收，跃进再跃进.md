Can we develop agricultural production at a faster pace? This is a major question facing the people of the whole country, especially agricultural cadres and peasant masses. During the First Five-Year Plan, China's agricultural production made great progress, and the total output value of agriculture and sideline industries, the total grain output, and the total cotton output all successfully completed the plan. However, compared with the needs of national construction and people's livelihood, the development speed of China's agriculture still lagged behind. In the first three years of the First Five-Year Plan, we mainly relied on the small-scale peasant economy for agricultural production, and the growth rate could not but be slow; in the latter two years, although the small-scale peasant economy was basically transformed into a cooperative economy, the time was still short, experience was still lacking, and the original production conditions could not be significantly changed in time, so the growth rate was still subject to many restrictions. What about the future? The situation will be very different. More than 97% of farmers have joined agricultural production cooperatives, and have gained considerable experience in collective management; after the nationwide rectification campaign and the consolidation of societies and the Party, most agricultural cooperatives have been further consolidated and improved. In the past two years, most agricultural cooperatives have also accumulated more production funds than in the past, and have undertaken some basic construction. The state's support for agriculture, especially industry's support for agriculture, is also increasing day by day. During the Second Five-Year Plan, chemical fertilizers, pesticides and agricultural machinery will increase much more than in the past. These are all new and favorable conditions for increasing agricultural production. At the same time, China's natural conditions are generally good. Even some factors that are currently considered unfavorable will be turned into favorable factors through our efforts. It is fully expected that during the Second Five-Year Plan, China's agricultural production growth rate will be much faster than during the First Five-Year Plan. The Draft National Agricultural Development Program requires that in the next ten years, in different regions, the unit area yield of grain should be increased to 400, 500, and 800 jin per mu, respectively, and the unit area yield of cotton should be increased to 40, 60, 80, and 100 jin per mu, respectively. We should have the confidence to complete this great task as scheduled or ahead of schedule, except for a very small number of regions with special circumstances. We should also have the ambition to strive to raise the unit area yield of various major crops in China to the highest level in the world in fifteen years or more.

This is an extremely glorious task. This task is arduous, but it is also achievable. During the First Five-Year Plan, despite the fact that 1956 was a year with relatively serious disasters, and 1957 also had many disasters, and only two years had passed since the realization of cooperation, a large number of glorious pioneers had already emerged throughout the country: 69 counties and cities distributed in 14 provinces and cities reached or exceeded the targets of 400, 500, and 800 jin of grain per mu as stipulated in the Draft National Agricultural Development Program ten or eleven years in advance (of which 4 counties reached the target in 1956, but did not reach it in 1957 due to disasters); of these, the grain yield per mu in 8 counties and cities reached more than 1,000 jin. As for the number of townships and societies that reached 400, 500, and 800 jin, there were even more. According to incomplete statistics from 13 provinces, there were 25,806 agricultural societies. There are already 5 counties and cities where cotton production has exceeded the highest target of the program (100 jin of ginned cotton per mu).

Of course, it is by no means an easy task to have all counties and cities in the country reach the targets stipulated in the program in ten years. As it seems now, realizing a great leap forward in agricultural production and gradually realizing the program targets is not without ideological obstacles. In many cadres and masses, there is still right-leaning conservative thinking. These people underestimate the favorable conditions and overestimate the difficult factors. They believe that agricultural production is limited by natural conditions and the current level of technology, and can only be gradual, not a leap forward; or they believe that other places can leap forward, but their own place cannot. What is the truth? Haven't the above-mentioned 69 counties and cities, and 25,806 agricultural cooperatives already leaped forward? The question of whether or not to leap forward no longer exists in fact, but only in the minds of some people. Natural conditions do have a great impact on agricultural production, so the Agricultural Development Program stipulates three different targets for three different regions; it also explains that in high-altitude and cold mountainous areas and particularly barren areas, appropriate targets can be stipulated separately. These are all in order to take care of different natural conditions. However, we cannot sit and wait for the blessings of heaven, but should strive to transform nature, restrict nature, and utilize nature to master the initiative in increasing grain production in our own hands.

There are many such examples: two regions are closely adjacent to each other, and the natural conditions are basically the same, but due to the different degree of subjective effort, the results in production are very different. This year, the grain yield per mu of cultivated land in Anguo County, Hebei Province, was 464 jin, while the grain yield per mu of cultivated land in Dingxian County this year was only 283 jin, a difference of 180 jin. In Pingyang County in the coastal plain of Zhejiang Province, the natural conditions are superior to those of Huangyan and Wenling, but this year's grain yield per mu in Huangyan and Wenling has reached 800 jin, an increase of 43%-65% in five years, while Pingyang County only has 615 jin, nearly 200 jin lower than Huangyan and Wenling, an increase of only 14% in five years. There are also some counties where the grain yield per mu of cultivated land has decreased compared with 1952 during the Five-Year Plan period. For example, in Jilin Province, the output of nine counties and cities including Dehui and Dongfeng in 1957 was lower than the level of the previous years before 1953; in Heilongjiang Province, the output of ten counties and cities including Qinggang, Tonghe, and Yian in 1957 was only equivalent to 69% or less of the output in 1952; in Hebei Province, the output in 1957 was lower than that in 1952 in 24 counties and cities including Longyao and Gu'an; and in Zhejiang Province, 12 counties including Yiwu and Jinhua experienced year-on-year declines in output from 1953 to 1956.

Why is it that the agricultural production in some counties has not only not leaped forward in the past few years, but has increased very little or even decreased in output? The reasons are of course multifaceted, but the most fundamental problem is that the leaders in these regions have serious right-leaning conservative ideas. Either they are blindly inferior, thinking that the local production conditions are too poor, and lack the determination and perseverance to transform nature, they just follow the rules and regulations, and do things according to the past "conventional" methods, and dare not take major reforms in production, and are helpless in the face of natural disasters. Or they are blindly complacent, thinking that local production has increased year after year, the potential has been tapped again and again, and the tricks have been found again and again, and the increase in production has reached the limit; under the guidance of this kind of thinking, they are not eager to make progress, unwilling to learn from the experience of other regions, and unwilling to further conduct in-depth investigation and research to find potential. The leaders in these regions should compare the typical examples of advanced regions, thoroughly and carefully examine the reasons for the slow or even reduced production in their own regions, find the key to the leap forward in local production, and muster up their strength to resolutely implement various effective measures to increase production, unaffected by any disturbances.

As the old saying goes, "Nothing is difficult in the world for those who set their minds to it." What we are doing is a revolutionary cause, and what we need most is revolutionary optimism and the heroic spirit of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." We want to transform human society, transform nature, and at the same time transform ourselves. Without revolutionary ambition, nothing can be accomplished. The cause of revolutionary construction is to transform the real world, and the old things will always stubbornly oppose the emergence and development of new things with inertia. Therefore, in the process of transformation, right-leaning conservative thinking is always present and needs to be fought with great strength. We must constantly and regularly oppose right-leaning conservative thinking in order to move forward victoriously and realize a great leap forward in production. Of course, when implementing any measure to increase production, we must use the mass line method of work, and not adopt the method of coercion and command. The reason why advanced and new things have great vitality is precisely because they meet the requirements and will of the broad masses; only when the broad masses recognize its superiority can the new things grow vigorously.

The pioneers who reached or exceeded the targets of the program ten or eleven years in advance have already set a good example for other regions in the country. Their achievements and experience have brought people strong confidence and effective methods for realizing the National Agricultural Development Program. Are the natural conditions and economic foundation of these counties and cities particularly good? No! From a regional perspective, they are found everywhere from Fushun in Liaoning and Funing and Lulong in northern Hebei in the north to Chaozhou and Shantou in Guangdong in the south, Dunhuang and Zhangye in Gansu in the west, and Huangyan and Wenling along the coast of Zhejiang in the east; some of them used to be high-yielding grain areas in the plains, and some of them were barren mountainous areas in the past; some of them are located in rainy and warm areas with an annual rainfall of 2,000 millimeters, and some are located in rainy and cold areas with an annual rainfall of only 300 to 400 millimeters. There are many places with the same, similar, or even better natural and economic conditions than some of these counties and cities. Why did only they reach the program targets ten or eleven years in advance? The reason cannot be found in objective conditions, but must be found in human factors. Their natural conditions are different, but the human conditions are roughly the same.

One of the common laws of the pioneers is to resolutely and fully rely on and utilize the superior conditions of agricultural cooperation and pay close attention to the consolidation of cooperatives. The flowers of socialism bloom luxuriantly, and the fruits of socialism are abundant. If we do not fully rely on and utilize the superior conditions of cooperation, it is unimaginable to obtain an average yield of 400, 500, 800, and 1,000 jin per mu on hundreds of thousands of mu of cultivated land in a county. Without agricultural cooperation, it is of course impossible to achieve such a goal; after realizing agricultural cooperation, if we relax the consolidation and improvement of agricultural societies, it is also impossible to achieve such a goal.

Their second common law is that the secretary takes action, the whole Party is mobilized, ideological work is done well, and the masses are relied on closely. The leaders in these regions regard agricultural production as the first-line combat task. In Anguo County, Hebei Province, secretaries from the county party committee to the rural branch are responsible for grasping production, and party committees at all levels have devoted four-fifths of their efforts to going deep into the grassroots level and grasping production. Cadres at the county, district, and township levels in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, are all under the unified leadership of the party committee, and are responsible for their respective tasks and are responsible to the end. In the process of developing production, especially at the beginning of formulating the plan for a leap forward in production, they also encountered various kinds of conservative thinking. They were not corroded by these conservative ideas, but overcame the many conservative ideas with a magnificent revolutionary spirit and meticulous persuasion work. The leaders in these regions adhered to the leadership style of going deep into reality and the mass line method of work. After thorough investigation and research, they found out the local family assets, summarized the experience of the masses, found the key to increasing production, and then worked with the masses to determine measures to increase production targeting these keys, relied on the strength of the masses to implement them, and stuck to the end. Many of them worked with old farmers to set up experimental fields, paid attention to discovering and cultivating typical examples, multi-point demonstrations, organized visits, mobilized all aspects of strength, and spread the most effective experience. In this way, the whole Party was united, top and bottom were united, and they persisted to the end to realize the production plan, and did not waver under various difficult circumstances.

They also have a striking common feature: in unfavorable natural conditions, they do not succumb to and are not discouraged, but give full play to their subjective initiative to overcome nature. Their experience proves that basic construction to change production conditions is the key to increasing production. They carried out a large amount of basic construction, fundamentally improved the local production conditions, and on this basis, actively changed the farming system and improved farming techniques according to local conditions.

Regions that have reached or exceeded the targets of the program should "go one step further," increase grain and industrial raw material production for the country, and set a better example for other regions. It may not be easy for high-yield areas to increase grain production by tens of percent to one time in a short period of time. However, these regions, due to their relatively abundant financial and material resources and rich production experience, can still steadily and continuously increase production as long as appropriate measures are taken. Shantou Prefecture in Guangdong, with an average grain yield of more than 800 jin per mu in the whole region, has already set the target of 1,000 jin per mu during the Second Five-Year Plan and 1,100 jin per mu during the Third Five-Year Plan; Zunhua County in Hebei, with an average yield of more than 400 jin per mu in the whole county, has also set the target of 460 jin per mu in 1958 and 800 jin per mu in 1962. This spirit of overcoming all difficulties, moving forward bravely, and constantly advancing should be advocated in every region without exception.

Grain production is the foundation of agricultural production. With enough grain, there will be no problem of grain and technical crops competing for land, and cotton, flue-cured tobacco, sugar beets, and oil crops can be further increased. With enough grain, there will be no problem of people and livestock competing for grain, and animal husbandry can also develop faster. Therefore, in the struggle to realize the Agricultural Development Program, we must focus on achieving the "four, five, eight" targets and strive for a comprehensive upsurge in agricultural production. The leaders in each region should seriously summarize the typical experience of their local areas and widely disseminate it; they must mobilize the masses to learn from the glorious pioneers and humbly learn from the experience of other places. Each region must use the revolutionary spirit to carry out the agricultural production and construction movement in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. It is time to move forward by leaps and bounds, don't hesitate any longer, take out all your strength and leap forward!

### 丰收再丰收，跃进再跃进

    丰收再丰收，跃进再跃进
    能不能以更快的速度发展农业生产呢？这是摆在全国人民特别是农业干部和农民群众面前的一个重大问题。第一个五年计划期间，我国的农业生产有很大的进展，农业和副业的总产值、粮食总产量和棉花总产量都胜利地完成了计划。但是，同国家建设和人民生活的需要相比较，我国农业的发展速度还是落后了一步。在第一个五年计划期间的前三年，我们主要依靠小农经济进行农业生产，增产速度不能不是缓慢的；在后二年，小农经济虽然基本上变成了合作经济，可是因为时间还短，经验还少，原有的生产条件还来不及进行重大的改变，所以增产速度还受到不少限制。今后呢？情况就会大不相同。97％以上的农民加入了农业生产合作社，并且已经取得了相当丰富的从事集体经营的经验；经过全民整风和整社、整党之后，大部分农业社更进一步巩固和提高了。两年中间，大部分农业社也已经积累了较过去为多的生产资金，有了一些基本建设。国家对于农业的支援，特别是工业对农业的支援也日益增加。在第二个五年计划期间，化学肥料、农药械和农业机器将比过去增加很多。这些都是农业增产的新的有利条件。同时，我国的自然条件一般说来是比较好的。即或现在认为是不利的某些因素，经过我们的努力，也将变成有利因素。完全可以预计，在第二个五年计划期间，我国农业增产速度将会比第一个五年计划期间快得多。全国农业发展纲要草案要求：在今后十年内，在不同地区，把粮食的单位面积产量分别提高到每亩四百斤、五百斤、八百斤，把棉花的单位面积产量分别提高到每亩四十斤、六十斤、八十斤、一百斤。我们应该有这样的信心，除了极少数情况特殊的地区外，如期或者提前完成这个伟大的任务。我们还应该有这样的雄心，争取在十五年或者更多一些时间内把我国各种主要作物的单位面积产量提高到世界上最高的水平。
    这是一个极其光荣的任务。这个任务是艰巨的，也是可以完成的。第一个五年计划期间，尽管1956年是灾情比较重的年份，1957年也有不少灾害，而且实现合作化也只有两年的时间，在全国各地已经出现了一大批光荣的先行者：分布在十四个省市的六十九个县、市提前十年或十一年达到或超过了全国农业发展纲要草案规定的亩产粮食四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的指标（其中有四个县在1956年达到，1957年因受灾未达到）；其中有八个县市的粮食亩产量达到了千斤以上。至于达到四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的乡、社，就更多了。据十三个省的不完全统计，就有二万五千八百零六个农业社。棉花产量超过纲要最高指标（亩产一百斤皮棉）的已经有五个县、市。
    当然，在十年当中使全国全部的县、市都达到纲要规定的指标，毕竟不是容易的事情。就现在看来，实现农业生产大跃进，逐步实现纲要指标，并不是没有思想障碍的。在不少干部和群众中，还存在着右倾保守思想。这些人对有利条件估计不足，对困难因素考虑过多。他们认为农业生产受自然条件和当前技术水平的限制，只能渐进，不能跃进；或者认为别的地方可以跃进，而自己这个地方就不能跃进。事实究竟是怎样的呢？上述的六十九个县市、二万五千八百零六个农业合作社，不是已经跃进了吗？能不能跃进的问题，在事实上已经不存在了，只不过在一些人的头脑中还存在着罢了。自然条件对农业生产确有很大的影响，所以农业发展纲要就三种不同的地区规定了三种不同的指标；同时说明在高寒山区、土地特别瘠薄的地区，可以另行规定适当的指标。这都是为了照顾不同的自然条件。但是，我们不可坐待老天爷的恩赐，而应该努力改造自然，限制自然，利用自然，把提高粮食产量的主动权掌握在自己手里。
    有许多这样的事例：两个地区紧紧相邻，自然条件基本相同，只是由于主观上努力的程度不同，而生产上的结果有很大的差别。河北省安国县今年粮食耕地亩产四百六十四斤，而定县今年粮食耕地亩产只有二百八十三斤，相差一百八十斤。浙江省滨海平原的平阳县，论自然条件优于黄岩、温岭，但是今年每亩粮食产量，黄岩、温岭都达到了八百斤，五年增产43％—65％，而平阳县只有六百一十五斤，低于黄岩、温岭近二百斤，五年仅增长14％。也还有这样一些县份，在五年计划期间，每亩耕地的粮食产量，反而较1952年降低了。如吉林省就有德惠、东丰等九个县市1957年的产量低于1953年以前几年的水平；黑龙江省有青冈、通河、依安等十个县市1957年的产量只相当于1952年产量的69％以下；河北省1957年的产量低于1952年的有隆尧、固安等二十四个县市；浙江省义乌、金华等十二个县从1953年到1956年年年减产。
    为什么有些县几年来农业生产不但没有跃进，而是增产很少甚至产量降低了呢？原因当然是多方面的，但是最根本的问题，是这些地区的领导者有严重的右倾保守思想。或者是盲目自卑，认为当地生产条件太差，又缺乏改造自然的决心和毅力，他们只是按部就班，按过去的“常规”办事，不敢在生产上采取重大的改革，在自然灾害的面前束手无策。或者是盲目自满，认为当地连年增产，潜力挖了又挖，窍门找了又找，增产已经到顶了；在这种思想指导下，他们上进心不切，不愿学习其他地区的经验，也不愿再进一步深入地调查研究，寻找潜力。这些地区的领导者，应该对照先进地区的典型事例，深入地仔细地检查本地增产不快甚至减产的原因，找出本地生产跃进的关键，鼓起劲来，把各项有效的增产措施坚决贯彻到底，不受任何风吹草动的影响。
    古语说：“世上无难事，只怕有心人。”我们干的是革命的事业，对于我们来说，最最需要的是革命的乐观主义，是“愚公移山”的英雄气概。我们要改造人类社会，改造大自然，同时也要改造我们自己。没有革命的志气，什么事也做不成。革命的建设的事业，就是要变革现实世界，而旧事物总要顽强地以惰性反对新事物的出现和发展。因此，在变革的过程中，右倾保守思想是经常存在的，需要用很大的力量同它进行斗争。必须不断地、经常地反对右倾保守思想，才能胜利前进，才能实现生产大跃进。当然，在贯彻执行任何增产措施的时候，都必须运用群众路线的工作方法，而不能采取强迫命令的办法。先进的新生的事物之所以有巨大的生命力，正因为它符合广大群众的要求和意志；新事物只有让广大群众认识了它的优越性，它才能蓬蓬勃勃地生长起来。
    提前十年或十一年达到了甚至超过了纲要指标的先行者，已经给全国其他地区作出了良好的榜样。他们的成绩和经验，给人们带来了实现全国农业发展纲要的坚强信心和有效办法。这些县市的自然条件和经济基础是不是都是特别好的呢？不是！从地区来看，北起辽宁的抚顺和河北北部的抚宁、卢龙，南至广东的潮州、汕头，西起甘肃的敦煌、张掖，东至浙江沿海的黄岩、温岭，东南西北到处都有；它们有些过去是平原的高产粮区，有些则是过去的贫瘠的山区；它们有些处于年雨量二千公厘的多雨温暖的地带，也有些处于年雨量只有三百到四百公厘的少雨寒冷地带。与它们的自然条件、经济条件相同、相似或者比它们之中的一些县市的条件要好得多的地方多得很，为什么只有它们提前十年、十一年达到纲要指标呢？这原因不能从客观条件中去找，而要从人为的因素中去找。它们的自然条件各不相同，人为的条件却大致相同。
    先行者的共同规律之一是坚决地充分地依靠和运用了农业合作化的优越条件，对合作社的整顿巩固工作密切注意。社会主义之花开得繁盛，社会主义之果也就结得丰硕。如果不充分依靠和运用合作化的优越条件，要在一个县的几十万亩耕地上获得平均亩产四百斤、五百斤、八百斤、一千斤的高额产量，是不能想像的事。没有农业合作化，要达到这样的目的固然不可能；实现了农业合作化以后放松了农业社的巩固和改进，要达到这样的目的也不可能。
    它们的第二条共同规律是书记动手，全党动员，做好思想工作，紧紧依靠群众。这些地区的领导者，把农业生产列为第一线的战斗任务。河北省安国县从县委到农村支部都是书记负责抓生产，各级党委并拿出了五分之四的力量深入基层，掌握生产。湖北省孝感县的县、区、乡各级干部，都在党委的统一领导下，分工负责，包干到底。在发展生产的过程中，特别是制订生产跃进的规划之初，他们也曾碰到各式各样的保守思想。他们没有受这些保守思想的腐蚀，而是以雄伟的革命气魄和细致的说服工作，战胜了重重的保守思想。这些地区的领导者坚持了深入实际的领导作风和群众路线的工作方法。他们经过充分的调查研究，摸清了当地的家底，总结了群众的经验，寻找出增产的关键，然后又同群众在一起针对这些关键定出增产措施，依靠群众的力量贯彻执行，一竿子插到底。他们之中有许多人同老农一起搞试验田，注意发现和培养典型，多点示范，组织参观，调动起各方面的力量，传播了最有效的经验。这样，就做到了全党一致，上下一致，为实现生产规划坚持到底，在各种困难情况下都不动摇。
    它们还有一个显著的共同的特点：在不利的自然条件下，不是屈服、气馁，而是发挥最大的主观能动性去战胜自然。它们的经验证明：改变生产条件的基本建设是增产关键之中的关键。它们进行了大量的基本建设，从根本上改善了当地的生产条件，并且在这基础上积极地因地制宜地改变耕作制度和提高耕作技术。
    已经达到或者超过了纲要指标的地区，应该“更上一层楼”，给国家增产更多的粮食和工业原料，给别的地区作出更好的榜样。高产区也许不容易在短时期内把粮食产量提高百分之几十到一倍。但是，这些地区由于财力物力比较充裕，生产经验比较丰富，只要措施得当，仍然可以稳定地继续不断地提高产量。全区平均亩产粮食八百多斤的广东汕头专区，已经定出在第二个五年计划期间亩产一千斤，第三个五年计划期间亩产一千一百斤的指标；全县每亩平均产量超过四百斤的河北遵化县，也定出了在1958年亩产四百六十斤，1962年亩产八百斤的指标。这种排除万难、一往无前、不断前进的精神，应该在每一个地区无例外地加以提倡。
    粮食生产是农业生产的基础。有了足够的粮食，就不会发生粮食和技术作物争地的问题，棉花、烤烟、甜菜和油料作物也就可能进一步增产。有了足够的粮食，也就不会发生人、畜争粮的问题，畜牧业也可以发展得更快。因此，在实现农业发展纲要的斗争中，要以达到“四、五、八”指标为中心，争取农业生产的全面高涨。每个地区的领导者都应该认真总结当地的典型经验，广泛传播；都要发动群众向光荣的先行者看齐，虚心学习外地的经验。每个地区，都要用革命的精神，又多又快又好又省地开展农业生产建设运动。是大踏步前进的时候了，不要再迟疑了，拿出全副力量向前跃进！
