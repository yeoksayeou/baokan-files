Talking about the Dance Drama "The Magic Lotus Lantern"
　　Xia Jing

　　The dance drama "The Magic Lotus Lantern" is adapted from a classical Chinese play, and it was recently performed by the Central Experimental Opera House. Creating national dance drama forms based on tradition is the right path. It is not easy to embark on this path, because in our country, dance dramas with national characteristics have not been completely handed down. Unlike European ballet, which has hundreds of years of history and can be completely inherited and continuously improved, if what we are asking for is a relatively complete art work with a truly national style, it really needs to go through a difficult creative process. But this is not terrible. The new history requires us to open up the road. We can imagine that in the near future, a more complete national dance drama will surely appear. The performance of "The Magic Lotus Lantern" has made a gratifying start.

　　From this performance of the dance drama "The Magic Lotus Lantern", we can see that our dancers are exploring this path. From the selection of the story, the form of the dance, costumes, and sets, they are all learning from our classical drama. The actors' skills and the director's design also show many novel things. However, we cannot help but regret that it still lacks the unique style of "dance drama" that is obviously different from other drama genres, which mainly involves the style issue of dance techniques and the cooperation with music.

　　In the play, we see that some of our classical dance movements have been inherited, but at the same time, foreign ballet movements are mixed in, which affects the unity and completeness of its style. This is not to say that we cannot absorb foreign things, but how to absorb them. Our classical dance is very beautiful and colorful. In our many classical dramas, we can still see some wonderful dance movements that have not been completely buried, like diamonds in the gravel still shining with their light. For example, the "stepping on stilts" technique in Sichuan Opera is somewhat similar to "ballet". Isn't its graceful dance posture matched with Chinese gongs and drums charming? "The Fairy Scattering Flowers" is almost entirely dance movements, and requires quite superb dance skills. This shows that there are many treasures to learn from our traditional dance art.

　　In the dance drama "The Magic Lotus Lantern", we can see the mixing of Chinese classical dance movements with Western ballet movements, as well as Chinese ancient folk dance with modern folk dance, losing characteristic movements, giving us a feeling of inconsistent styles. The combination between them shows that there are still great cracks, and it has not yet melted into a unified style. This issue probably involves what the basic movements of Chinese classical dance are, and also involves how to absorb foreign dance art. Because these problems have not been well resolved in the dance drama "The Magic Lotus Lantern," it significantly affects the vocabulary of the dance drama—that is, the dance movements—which appears relatively poor. In particular, the male lead's movements appear monotonous and ordinary, unable to express rich emotions with colorful movements. The female lead's movements are also not very varied. What limits the variety of movements? Is it simply a technical problem? I don't think so. It is the issue of the characteristics of the movements, the style of dance techniques. We know that dance, in addition to having the most fundamental relationship with music, its dance posture—including its expression, posture movements—must be rich in national sentiments and national habitual movements to form a dance style with national characteristics. Especially in classical dance, it must also have its era characteristics. And dance technique must be a product of dance style. Techniques that are separated from a certain style are only pure techniques.

　　The dance drama "The Magic Lotus Lantern" lacks a unified and complete style, not only because of the dance movements, but also because of the lack of coordination with the music. An orchestra composed entirely of Western instruments, although it can also play some Chinese-style melodies, is ultimately unable to express Chinese flavor, especially the ancient charm. This is likely very relevant to the selection of national musical instruments, because the timbre of the instruments themselves has a representativeness, and the sound of a nation naturally has the characteristics of a national sentiment. Music is the soul of dance. It expresses the mental state, emotions, and atmosphere of the dance. Its style and sentiment strengthen the rhythm of the dance. In dance drama, music must also cooperate with the thematic requirements of the dance drama. However, the music in the dance drama "The Magic Lotus Lantern" lacks this kind of expressiveness, lacks distinct Chinese national characteristics, which cannot but greatly detract from the "national dance drama."

　　Dance must have a clear musical rhythm to suit the requirements of the dance character. In the dance drama, music does not only play a role in setting off the atmosphere, but it must also have significant changes in each chapter to explain the development of the plot. It must also give the dance a strong and clear rhythm, giving the dance a strict requirement for the beat. In the Soviet dance drama "Swan Lake", we see this example; the actions and music are seamless. With the development and changes of the plot, each chapter of the music has a clear difference, and each character dance (such as Spanish dance or Polish dance) also has a significantly different style. And the theme music of the play leaves a deep impression. All these characteristics are clearly not well done in the dance drama "The Magic Lotus Lantern."

　　In addition, in the dance drama "The Magic Lotus Lantern", we also feel that the set is relatively redundant, not very suitable for the requirements of the dance drama. The costumes are not rich enough in character characteristics. The scene arrangement is not concise enough. The purpose of the dance movements is not clear enough, etc. But these aspects have obviously been done well, and it is relatively easy to improve them more satisfactorily. However, the issue of dance style and music cooperation is a basic principle issue on our road of dance drama creation, which needs to arouse everyone's concern and discussion.

　　Let us happily accept the historical task that our predecessors have not completed. This is very glorious!

    谈谈舞剧“宝莲灯”
    夏静
    舞剧“宝莲灯”是根据我国古典剧改编的，中央实验歌剧院最近上演了它。在传统的基础上创造民族形式的舞剧，是一条正确的道路。走向这条道路是不容易的，因为在我国，富有民族色彩的舞剧还没有被完整的流传下来，它不像欧洲的芭蕾舞已有数百年的历史，可以完整地继承下来而日益加以精益求精。如果我们所要求的舞剧是比较完整的，真正具有民族风格的艺术作品，确实还需经过一段艰苦的创作历程。但这并不可怕，新的历史要求我们来开辟道路，我们可以设想不久的将来，定会出现比较完整的民族舞剧。“宝莲灯”的上演，已经作了可喜的开端。
    从这次舞剧“宝莲灯”的演出，可以看到我们的舞蹈工作者正在摸索着走向这条道路，从故事的采取，舞蹈的形式，服装，布景等都在向我国的古典剧学习；演员的技巧，导演的设计，也都表现了许多新颖的东西。但，我们还不能不遗憾的说，它还缺少应与其它剧种显然有别的“舞剧”所独具的风格，其中主要是舞蹈技巧上的风格问题及与音乐合作的问题。
    剧中，我们看到继承了一些我国古典舞蹈动作，但同时掺杂了外国芭蕾舞动作，这就影响到它的风格的统一和完整。这不是说不可以吸取外国的东西，而是在于如何吸取的问题。我国的古典舞蹈是十分优美多采的，在我们的许多古典剧中，都还可以看到一些没有被完全埋没的精彩的舞蹈动作，如像乱砂石中的钻石还闪耀着它的光芒。如川剧中的“踩蹻”技巧方法就有些儿类似“芭蕾”，它的优美的舞姿配合中国的锣鼓，不是很迷人的吗？“天女散花”，几乎全部是舞蹈动作，而且需要相当高超的舞蹈技巧。这都说明从我们的传统舞蹈艺术中，有很多可借鉴的宝藏。
    在舞剧“宝莲灯”中，我们可以看出中国的古典舞动作与西洋的芭蕾舞动作、以及中国的古代民间舞与现代民间舞之间的掺杂混合，失去了富有特征性的动作，使我们产生格调不一的感觉，它们之间的结合看得出还有很大的裂痕，还没有融化成统一格调的东西。这个问题恐怕涉及到什么是中国古典舞蹈的基本动作问题，也同样涉及到如何吸收外来的舞蹈艺术的问题。由于这些问题，在舞剧“宝莲灯”中还未获得很好的解决，就相当地影响到舞剧的语汇——即舞蹈动作，显得比较贫乏。特别是男主角的动作，显得单调平凡，无法用多采的动作来表现丰富的情感。女主角的动作同样也是变化不多。是什么限制了动作的多采？单纯是技巧问题吗？我看不是，而是动作的特征性的问题，舞蹈技巧的风格问题。我们知道，舞蹈，除了与音乐有最根本的关系外，而舞姿——包括它的表情，身段动作，必须富有民族的情调，民族的习惯动作，才能形成富有民族色彩的舞蹈风格。特别是在古典舞蹈中，还必须具有它的时代特征。而舞蹈技巧还必须是舞蹈风格的产物，脱离一定风格的技巧，只不过纯是技巧而已。
    舞剧“宝莲灯”缺乏统一完整的风格，除舞蹈动作的原因之外，与音乐不协调有很大关系；以全部西洋乐器所组成的管弦乐队，虽然也能奏出一些中国式旋律的曲调，但究竟无力表现中国的风味，特别是古色古香的气息。这在民族乐器的选用上想是非常有关的问题，因为乐器的音色本身即有一种代表性，一个民族的乐音自然富有一个民族情调的特征。音乐是舞蹈的灵魂，它表现了舞蹈的精神状态，情感，气氛，它的风格和情调，加强舞蹈的节奏感，在舞剧中的音乐还必须配合舞剧的主题要求。然而在舞剧“宝莲灯”中的音乐却缺乏这方面的表现力，缺乏鲜明的中国民族色彩，这就不能不使“民族舞剧”大大减色。
    舞蹈，必须有鲜明的音乐节奏，才能适于舞蹈性格的要求。在舞剧中的音乐不止起着烘托气氛的作用，它还必须在每一章节中有着显著的变化，来说明剧情的发展，它还必须给舞蹈强烈而鲜明的节奏，给舞蹈的节拍规定了严格的要求。在苏联舞剧“天鹅湖”中，我们就看到这种范例；动作与音乐之间是无隙可乘的。随着剧情的发展变化，音乐的每一章节即有显明的不同，而每一性格舞蹈（如西班牙舞或波兰舞），它的音乐亦有显著不同的风格。而剧的主题音乐却给人留下深刻的印象。所有这些特点，在舞剧“宝莲灯”中，显然是做得很不够的。
    其它，在舞剧“宝莲灯”中，我们还感到布景比较冗赘，不十分适于舞剧的要求。服装还不够富于人物特征。场面安排上还欠简洁。舞蹈动作的目的性不够明确等。但这些方面显然是已经作得不错的了，要改进得更圆满一些是比较容易做到的。而舞蹈的风格与音乐的合作的问题却是我们在舞剧创作道路上的基本原则问题，是需要引起大家关怀和探讨的问题。
    让我们高兴地来接受前人未完成的历史任务吧，这是十分光荣的！
