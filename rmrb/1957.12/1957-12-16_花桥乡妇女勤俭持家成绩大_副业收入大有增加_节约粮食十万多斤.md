Xinhua News Agency report: Women in Huaqiao Township, Wengan County, Guizhou Province, have greatly increased their income and saved a lot of grain and cotton cloth after implementing the policy of thrift and diligence in managing their households.

In the past year, women in Huaqiao Township have actively participated in collective labor in agricultural cooperatives and have used their spare time to develop sideline production. Now, each household has raised one pig and more than ten chickens and ducks, and has also harvested 160,000 jin of vegetables from their private plots, achieving complete self-sufficiency in food, vegetables, feed, and pocket money. As a result, this year, the 957 cooperative member households in the township have received an average of 56 yuan per household from these sideline incomes alone, an increase of more than 71% over last year; they have also saved more than 200,000 jin of grain to sell to the state. Cooperative members' loans from the state have decreased compared to the past, while the money deposited in credit cooperatives has increased by 21% compared to last year.

Last year, Huaqiao Township had increased grain production, and a general phenomenon of extravagance and waste appeared in the lives of cooperative members. Everyone only ate refined grains and not coarse grains, used grain to feed pigs and chickens, etc., and weddings and daughter's marriages were also very extravagant, wasting more than 70,000 jin of grain in total. This spring, the Huaqiao Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party led housewives in launching a campaign to save grain, reduce expenses, and oppose extravagance and waste, and the atmosphere of thrift began to be established. On the basis of raising their political awareness, every household automatically formulated comprehensive plans for developing household sideline occupations, saving cotton and grain, and reducing expenses. For example, arranging grain consumption according to the agricultural season, generally stipulating that coarse grains are eaten in winter, miscellaneous grains in summer, and rice in spring and autumn; advocating eating brown rice and improving cooking techniques, etc. More than 100,000 jin of grain have been saved. In terms of saving cloth, the slogan "new for three years, old for three years, patching and mending for another three years" was put forward, and 400 more zhang of cotton cloth were also used.

　　花桥乡妇女勤俭持家成绩大
    副业收入大有增加　节约粮食十万多斤
    新华社讯　贵州省瓮安县花桥乡妇女贯彻勤俭持家的方针后，收入比过去大大增加，并且节约了许多粮食和棉布。
    花桥乡的妇女近一年来积极参加农业社的集体劳动，并且利用空余时间开展副业生产，现在每户已喂了一头生猪和十多只鸡鸭，还在自留地里收获十六万斤蔬菜，做到了食粮、蔬菜、饲料和零用钱完全自给。这样，今年全乡九百五十七户社员，仅以上几项副业收入，平均每户就分得五十六元，比去年增加71％多；还节约了二十多万斤粮食卖给国家。社员们向国家的贷款比过去减少了，而存入信用社的钱则比去年增加了21％。
    花桥乡去年粮食获得增产，社员生活中普遍出现了铺张浪费现象。大家只吃细粮，不吃粗粮，用粮食喂猪、鸡等，结婚、嫁女儿也很铺张，共浪费粮食七万多斤。今春，中共花桥乡支部领导家庭主妇展开了节约粮食、节省开支、反对铺张浪费的工作，勤俭的风气才开始树立起来。她们在政治觉悟提高的基础上，家家户户自动订出发展家庭副业、节约棉粮、减少开支的全面计划。如按照农事季节安排用粮，一般地规定冬季吃粗粮、夏季吃杂粮，春秋两季吃大米；提倡吃糙米，改进煮饭技术等。节约的粮食已有十万多斤。在节约用布方面，提出了“新三年、旧三年、补补连连穿三年”的口号，也少用了棉布四百多丈。
