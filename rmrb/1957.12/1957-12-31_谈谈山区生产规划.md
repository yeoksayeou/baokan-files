On Mountain Area Production Planning
Gu Yue

"Nine harvests in a year: spring brings medicinal herbs, summer yields apricot kernels, spring and autumn are for wool, white dew brings fruit, a series of harvests from the large fields, pine nuts in between, sideline income from weaving baskets, winter begins with firewood and logging, deep winter brings hunting." This folk song circulating among the people in the mountainous areas of Hebei Province vividly illustrates the richness and diversity of production in these regions, and the wide range of avenues for the people to increase their income. This demonstrates that production in mountainous areas should not be singular but diversified, integrating agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations to develop a variety of economic activities.

How can we rationally develop the resources of mountainous areas and effectively develop a diverse economy? A crucial first step is to formulate an active yet reliable mountain area production plan, based on the spirit of overall planning and comprehensive development. Article 17 of the National Agricultural Development Outline (Revised Draft) stipulates: "Special districts, counties, townships, and agricultural cooperatives in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas should all formulate long-term mountain area production plans to rationally use land and promote the overall development of production." The experiences and lessons of mountain area production in the past few years have also taught us that because there are many avenues for production and great potential for increasing production in mountainous areas, without a comprehensive production plan to guide production, blindness and one-sidedness will occur. It will be impossible to rationally utilize the land and other resources of the mountainous areas, to effectively overcome the contradictions between agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations, and therefore impossible to comprehensively develop the mountain area economy.

What should a mountain area production plan include? Whether for a region or a cooperative, a mountain area production plan should include the following main aspects:

1.  Land Use Planning. This is the foundation of a mountain area production plan. This plan must be carried out in accordance with the principle of adapting to local conditions to achieve the goal of rational land use. That is to say, under the principle of fully utilizing land fertility and maintaining water and soil, based on various conditions such as ground slope, soil layer thickness, soil fertility, vegetation cover and growth, degree of soil erosion, population density, and amount of cultivated land, the land suitable for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and other production uses, as well as village, road, and special purpose land, should be rationally arranged.

2.  Agricultural Planning. In order to fully utilize areas designated for agricultural development, specific plans should be made for crop types (grain crops, annual or perennial cash crops), acreage, and yields, and various measures to increase production, such as breeding improved varieties, applying more fertilizer, improving techniques, improving soil, and preventing pests, diseases, birds, and animal damage, should be proposed.

Grain production is the foundation of all production. In areas with a small population and wasteland suitable for reclamation, cultivated land should be expanded without damaging water and soil conservation to actively increase grain production, striving for grain self-sufficiency and having surplus grain for famine preparedness. In areas with high mountains, steep slopes, less cultivated land, and a large population, emphasis should be placed on increasing yield per unit area, striving for partial or even complete grain self-sufficiency.

3.  Forestry Planning. Developing forestry in mountainous areas can not only supply the timber and other forestry products needed for national construction and people's lives, greatly increasing the income of the people in mountainous areas, but also prevent soil erosion and reduce natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and frost damage. Therefore, every mountainous area should have an active plan for developing forestry production. In the planning, on the one hand, the existing forest resources should be inventoried, and specific measures for forest protection, fire prevention, pest and disease control, silvicultural renewal, and harvesting and utilization should be proposed. On the other hand, based on the situation of barren mountains and wastelands suitable for afforestation, targets for afforestation and closing hillsides for afforestation should be set. In the afforestation plan, the types of forests, tree species, seed collection, seedling cultivation, management methods, afforestation methods, and the order of afforestation should also be clearly specified.

4.  Animal Husbandry Planning. Developing animal husbandry is an important measure to increase animal power and fertilizer, ensure the supply of meat, milk, fur, and other animal products, and increase farmers' income. When planning, the types, quantity, and development progress of livestock must be determined based on topography, pasture area, water, soil, and other conditions. At the same time, good arrangements should be made for breeding improved varieties, eliminating epidemics, cultivating pasture, implementing rotational grazing, hay cutting, and management systems.

5.  Water Conservancy Planning. Doing a good job in water and soil conservation and building water conservancy projects are important measures to reduce flood and drought disasters and ensure increased agricultural production. In the planning of water conservancy construction in mountainous areas, combined with river basin planning, clear provisions should be made for projects to expand irrigation, such as opening canals, building dams, and constructing small reservoirs, and for measures for water power utilization, as well as water and soil conservation projects such as drinking water for people and livestock, retaining mud and sediment, and building gully dams and ponds, based on specific conditions.

6.  Local Specialty and Sideline Production Planning. There are many avenues for production in mountainous areas, and each region and cooperative should plan for the development of various specialties (such as tussah silk, rosin, tung oil, cork, raw lacquer, baked rubber, etc.) and other sideline production (such as collecting medicinal herbs, raising aquatic products, raising silkworms, beekeeping, gathering firewood, hunting, papermaking, firing kilns, etc.) based on the characteristics of different mountainous areas. The plan should indicate the direction and steps of development, as well as specific measures to improve quality and increase output.

7.  Labor Force Planning. The population in mountainous areas is generally sparse, and in the comprehensive development of mountain area production, the labor force will be insufficient. This makes it particularly necessary to make plans for the labor force needed for various production and construction projects according to the labor force situation, in order to ensure that various production increase targets can be effectively implemented and successfully completed.

8.  Transportation Planning. To promote the exchange of materials and the development of mountain area production, plans should be made for local roads and transportation tools according to needs and possibilities.

9.  Other Planning. In the next few years, local leading organs and cooperatives need to make corresponding plans for new village construction, finance and trade, supply and marketing cooperation, culture and education, health care, and other aspects in mountainous areas, based on the characteristics and development requirements of mountainous areas.

Mountain area production planning is a comprehensive task that includes various productions. It requires the unified planning of party and government leading organs, as well as close cooperation between agricultural, forestry, water conservancy and other departments. In the planning process, the masses should be mobilized to do it themselves, and cadres should actively help, providing guidance and assistance in technical work such as surveying, calculating, and drawing planning maps. Only by combining the opinions of the masses with scientific guidance can the production plan become the program for the people in mountainous areas to develop production and the goal of long-term struggle.

Mountain area production planning should include both a long-term plan for ten to fifteen years and a short-term plan for the next one or two years. It should not only conform to the long-term needs of national economic development, but also solve the urgent problems that need to be solved in the current production and life of the masses. The planning scheme should not only have active and reliable development targets for various productions, but also have practical and feasible specific measures to ensure the realization of the targets.

According to statistics as of June this year, 9,000 mountain area townships across the country have initially carried out mountain area production planning. Making a mountain area production plan is only the beginning of building a mountain area. What is more important is how to strive to realize the plan. After six townships including Sangpan and Shitoupo in Lushan County, Henan, carried out planning, the party branches of each township quickly adopted publicity and education measures to eliminate ideological obstacles for the masses, and led 17 cooperatives to formulate annual plans, 16 cooperatives to formulate seasonal plans, and 10 cooperatives to formulate overproduction plans for production teams. The township and cooperative leaders also listened to the opinions of the masses and revised inappropriate targets, so the masses were very motivated, and the results of various productions were also very prominent. If this spirit can be maintained, the plans of these townships and cooperatives are entirely possible to realize. However, some comrades have taken an unserious attitude towards production planning. Some townships and cooperatives in some areas have implemented a part of the planning scheme that they considered appropriate, but for other parts, they have neither implemented nor revised them. This attitude of course cannot make the plan continue to play a role in guiding production and inspiring the masses to move forward. There are also some townships and cooperatives that do not have enough understanding of planning, or because the planning scheme is divorced from reality, they regard planning as a one-shot deal and do not implement it at all. What is the use of such a plan?

Now, agricultural cooperatives in various places are launching a mass debate on the production and construction issues of their own cooperatives, in conjunction with the discussion of the National Agricultural Development Outline (Revised Draft). Townships and cooperatives that have not yet formulated mountain area production plans should formulate their own production plans on the basis of this debate. Townships and cooperatives that have already carried out planning should also review and revise their own production plans in accordance with the spirit of the National Agricultural Development Outline (Revised Draft) in order to remove unrealistic or inappropriate parts of the plan and supplement places that are not comprehensive enough, so that the production plan can play an active role in the great cause of developing mountainous areas and building mountainous areas in the future.

    谈谈山区生产规划
    谷岳
    “一年竟有九个秋：春暖花开药材秋，入了暑伏杏核秋，春秋两季羊毛秋，到了白露水果秋，接二连三大田秋，当中夹着松籽秋，割条编筐副业秋，立冬割柴伐木秋，数九隆冬打猎秋。”这是河北省山区群众中流传着的一段民谣。从这首歌谣的描绘中可以看到，山区的生产内容是多么丰富多采，山区人民增加收入的途径是多么广阔。这说明，山区的生产不应该是单一化，而应该是多样化，应该是农、林、牧、副业相结合，发展多种经济。
    怎样才能合理地开发山区的资源，有效地发展山区多种经济呢？首先一个重要事情，就是根据统筹兼顾、全面开发山区的精神，因地制宜地制定一个积极而可靠的山区生产规划。全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）第十七条规定：“山区、半山区的专区、县、乡和农业合作社，都应当制定较长期的山区生产规划，合理地使用土地，促进生产的全面发展。”过去几年山区生产当中的经验教训也告诉我们：由于山区的生产门路很多，增产潜力很大，如果没有一个全面的生产规划去指导生产，生产中就会发生盲目性和片面性，就不可能合理地利用山区的土地和别的资源，不可能有效地克服农、林、牧、副业之间的矛盾，因此也就不可能全面地发展山区的经济。
    山区生产规划包括哪些内容呢？不论一个地区也好，一个合作社也好，山区生产规划都应该包括下面几个主要方面：
    1、土地利用规划。这是山区生产规划的基础。这项规划必须根据因地制宜的原则去进行，达到合理利用土地的目的。这就是说，要在充分发挥地力、保持水土的原则下，根据地面坡度、土层厚薄、土质肥瘦、植物复被和生长情况、水土流失程度以及人口密度、耕地多少等各种条件，将宜农、宜林业、宜牧用地和其他生产用地，以及村庄、道路用地和特种用地，分别加以合理安排。
    2、农业规划。为了充分利用划为发展农业的地区，要对农作物种类（粮食作物、一年生或多年生经济作物）、面积、产量进行具体规划，并且提出繁殖良种、增施肥料、改进技术、改良土壤、防止病虫鸟兽害等各项增产措施。
    粮食生产是各项生产的基础，在人口不多、有荒地适于开垦的地区，应该在不破坏水土保持的条件下扩大耕地面积、积极增产粮食争取粮食自给，并有余粮备荒。在山高坡陡、耕地较少、人口较多的地区，应该着重提高单位面积产量，争取粮食部分以至全部自给。
    3、林业规划。在山区发展林业，不仅可以供应国家建设和人民生活所需要的木材和其他林业产品，大量增加山区人民的收入，而且可以防止水土流失，减免水旱风霜等自然灾害。因此每个山区都应有发展林业生产的积极规划。在规划中，一方面要查清现有森林资源，并提出护林防火、病虫害防治、抚育更新和采伐利用等具体措施，另一方面要根据宜林的荒山荒地的情况，定出造林、封山育林的指标。在造林规划中对于林种、树种、种子采集、苗木培育、经营方式、造林方法、造林的先后次序等，也都要明确规定。
    4、畜牧规划。发展畜牧业是增加畜力和肥料，保证肉、乳、皮毛等畜产品供应，增加农民收入的重要措施。在规划的时候，必须根据地形、牧场面积、水土等条件，规定牲畜的种类、数量和发展进度。同时，对于繁殖良种、消灭疫病、培植牧草、实行轮牧、割草、管理制度也要很好地安排。
    5、水利规划。作好水土保持，兴修水利，是减免水旱灾害，保证农业增产的重要措施。在山区的水利建设的规划中，要结合河流的流域规划，对于开渠、筑坝、修小水库等扩大灌溉的工程和水力利用措施，以及人畜饮水、拦泥留淤、修筑谷坊和池塘等水土保持工程，都应该根据具体情况作出明确规定。
    6、土特产与副业规划。山区的生产门路很多，各个地区和各个合作社都应该对于发展各种特产（如柞蚕、松香、桐油、栓皮、生漆、烤胶等）和其他副业生产（如采集药材、养殖水产、养蚕、养蜂、打柴、打猎、造纸、烧窑等）根据不同的山区特点加以规划。在规划中，应当指出发展的方向、步骤和提高质量、产量的具体措施。
    7、劳动力规划。山区人口一般比较稀少，在全面发展山区生产当中，劳动力将感不足。这就特别需要按照劳动力的情况分别作出各项生产建设所需要的劳动力的规划，以保证各项增产指标能够切实执行和胜利完成。
    8、交通运输规划。为促进物资交流和山区生产的发展，要根据需要和可能，对当地的各种道路与交通运输工具作出规划。
    9、其他规划。今后若干年内山区的新村庄建设、金融贸易、供销合作、文化教育、卫生医疗等方面，需要各地领导机关和合作社根据山区的特点和发展要求，作出相应的规划。
    山区生产规划是包括各项生产的综合性工作，它要求党政领导机关的统一筹划，也要求农业、林业、水利等部门密切合作。在规划过程中，要发动群众自己去做，干部积极帮助，在勘测计算和绘制规划图等技术工作方面给予指导和协助。只有把群众的意见和科学的指导结合起来，生产规划才能成为山区人民发展生产的纲领和长期奋斗的目标。
    山区生产规划中，既要包括十年至十五年的远景计划，也要包括近一、二年的近期计划，既要服从国家发展经济的长远需要，又要解决群众当前生产生活中迫切需要解决的问题。在规划方案中既要有积极可靠的各项生产的发展指标，又要有保证实现指标的切实可行的具体措施。
    根据截至今年6月的统计，全国已有九千个山区乡初步进行了山区生产规划。作出山区生产规划仅仅是建设山区的开端，更重要的是如何努力实现规划。河南鲁山县桑盘、石头坡等六个乡进行规划以后，各乡党支部迅速采取了宣传教育措施，解除群众的思想障碍，领导十七个社定出了年度计划，十六个社定出了季节计划，十个社定出了生产队的超产计划，各社开展了劳动竞赛。乡、社领导方面并且倾听群众意见，将不合适的指标作了修改，所以群众劲头很大，各项生产成绩也很突出。如果这种精神能够坚持下去，这些乡、社的规划是完全可能实现的。但是，也有部分同志对生产规划采取了不严肃的态度。有些地区的乡、社把规划方案中认为合适的一部分执行了，对于其他部分，既未执行，也未修改，这种态度当然不可能使规划继续发挥指导生产、鼓舞群众前进的作用。还有一些乡、社对规划认识不足，或者因为规划方案脱离实际，规划完了就算完事大吉，根本没有执行。这样的规划有什么用处呢？
    现在各地农业合作社正在结合对全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的讨论，展开关于本地本社生产建设问题的群众性大辩论。凡是没有制定山区生产规划的乡、社，应该在这次大辩论的基础上，制定出本乡、本社的生产规划。已经进行过规划的乡、社，也应该根据农业发展纲要（修正草案）的精神，审查和修订自己的生产规划，以便去掉规划中不切实际的或不妥当的部分，补充不够全面的地方，这样才能使生产规划在今后开发山区、建设山区的伟大事业中发挥积极的作用。
