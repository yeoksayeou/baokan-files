    Peking University Holds Anti-Waste Exhibition

    (Our newspaper dispatch) To support the discussions among students on opposing waste and promoting hard work, plain living, and thrift, the Peking University Communist Youth League Committee and Student Union held an "Anti-Waste Exhibition." The exhibition exposed the phenomena of waste in the school concerning food, water and electricity, instruments, books, furniture, sports equipment, clothing, and other aspects.

    The exhibition displayed examples of wasting food and carelessly discarding it. Damaged instruments and specimens filled the entire exhibition room. Many thermometers and test tubes were broken, and specimens were incomplete. The Physics Department alone damaged more than 300 instruments in a little over a year, of which 26 valuable ones were worth 5,700 yuan. This not only caused losses to the state but also created difficulties for teaching. The library lost 3,019 books in more than three years. The exhibition room also contained beds without bed boards, and tables and benches without tops or legs. From this summer vacation to now, more than 200 tables and 400 to 500 benches have been damaged, and the value of the lampshades broken in the past two years has reached more than 3,000 yuan. There were also found quilts, sweaters, suitcases, bicycles, etc., and there were hundreds of pens in the lost and found office that no one claimed. (Chang Li)

    北京大学举办反浪费展览会
    本报讯　为了配合学生中的反对浪费，提倡艰苦朴素勤俭节约的讨论，北京大学团委会和学生会举办了“反浪费展览会”。这个展览会揭发了学校在粮食、水电、仪器、图书、家具、体育用品、衣物等方面的浪费现象。
    展览会里陈列了浪费粮食，随便丢弃食物的实例。被损坏的仪器和标本，摆满了整个展览室。不少温度计、试管断头折腰，标本残缺不全。仅物理系在一年多时间内就损坏仪器三百多件，其中二十六件贵重的就值五千七百元。这不仅给国家造成了损失，也给教学带来了困难。图书馆在三年多的时间内竟遗失了图书三千零十九册。展览室里还放着没有床板的床，没有桌面、凳面或腿的桌子和凳子。从今年暑假到现在，就损坏了二百多张桌子和四、五百张凳子，而近二年内被打破的灯罩价值达三千元之多。这里还有拣来的棉被、毛衣、皮箱、自行车等等，光钢笔就有上百枝放在招领室没有人领。　（常立）
