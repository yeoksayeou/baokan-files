Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: Khrushchev’s speech at the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Supreme Soviet’s resolution on the foreign policy of the Soviet government, and Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko’s speech have become the focus of attention for newspapers in the United States and European countries.

The U.S. State Department refused to comment on December 21 on the peace initiatives of the Supreme Soviet and government leaders of the Soviet Union, but U.S. newspapers all used large headlines to report on the resolution on foreign policy, Khrushchev’s report, and Gromyko’s statement from the recently concluded Supreme Soviet session.

Associated Press correspondent Rogers in Washington reported: "U.S. officials are treating the proposals of the Supreme Soviet session for an international conference and summit meeting on disarmament with great coldness." However, the reporter believes that "this preemptive negative answer is by no means the final answer." Rogers wrote that before Dulles "may be the most difficult problem in his life - the Soviet Union has launched a broad offensive to ensure peaceful coexistence, while America's allies are showing signs of wavering."

The "New York American Journal" published a report from the International News Service quoting "the opinions of Western diplomats" that Khrushchev's call in his report to maintain the status quo in relations between East and West was very "important." "Western diplomats believe that Khrushchev's speech on maintaining the status quo has very significant meaning."

The "New York Times" published a report from its Washington correspondent Ken W. Claiborne, under official instructions and with obvious inflammatory intent, which quoted "Washington diplomats" and rehashed the old tune that the Soviet proposals were "propaganda." However, Claiborne's report still revealed Washington's obvious anxiety caused by the Soviet Union's "continuing movement to strive for peaceful coexistence."

Many British newspapers unanimously advocated quickly accepting the Soviet proposals and holding a summit meeting.

The British Cooperative Party's newspaper, "Reynolds News," condemned the adventurous military plans of the North Atlantic group leaders, advocated promptly adopting the Soviet proposal to convene a special session of the UN General Assembly to discuss disarmament issues, and adopting the Soviet proposal to hold a high-level meeting to discuss the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe and the Near East issue.

Bevan, in an editorial in the "World News" on the 22nd, called for "world politicians to gather together to discuss ways to reach an agreement." Bevan pointed out: American leadership over the West "will prove to be a disaster for all of us. It must be resisted."

The "Sunday Express" said in an editorial that the demand to hold summit talks with Russia is the irresistible desire of the overwhelming majority of the country.

Even the extreme right-wing British newspapers, although with some reservations, also advocated negotiating with the Soviet Union.

The French "Sunday Weekly" emphasized the Soviet government's proposal to convene a special session of the UN General Assembly or an international conference to discuss disarmament issues, as well as the Soviet and American representatives holding talks before a broader meeting of the heads of government of capitalist and socialist countries. The newspaper pointed out that some commentators believe that the Soviet Union attaches greater importance to direct talks between Soviet and American leaders than the foreign ministers' meeting proposed by the participants of the recent North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council. The newspaper added: "Many commentators believe that the two speeches at the Supreme Soviet session (Gromyko's and Khrushchev's speeches) are the basis for continued negotiations between East and West."

Bonn's "Sunday World" in West Germany emphasized in its report that "forty-eight hours after the end of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Paris Conference, the Soviet government proposed implementing a policy of easing tensions as a response." "Sunday World" and "Bonn Review" both emphasized that Khrushchev advocated prohibiting war as a means of resolving international disputes.

Italian newspapers paid great attention to the resolution on the Soviet government's foreign policy adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. "Unità" pointed out that Khrushchev's speech and Gromyko's statement very clearly showed the Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people's fervent desire for peace. "Il Messaggero" believes that the resolution of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union means that the Soviet Union has rejected the negotiation conditions put forward by the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, but "the door to negotiations has not been closed."

The Swedish "Stockholm News" supported the proposal to convene a great power conference in an editorial.

In publishing detailed summaries of Khrushchev's speech, Danish newspapers particularly pointed out that Khrushchev said that Denmark and Norway were correct in assessing the current situation when they refused to deploy rocket bases on their territories.

    西方舆论重视苏联和平呼吁
    认为应该接受赫鲁晓夫和葛罗米柯的倡议
    美国官方人士内心充满焦虑故意表示冷淡
    本报综合报道　据新华社23日讯：赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上的发言、最高苏维埃关于苏联政府外交政策的决议和苏联外交部长葛罗米柯的发言，成为美国和欧洲国家报纸的注意中心。
    美国国务院21日拒绝评论苏联最高苏维埃和政府领导人的和平倡议，但是美国各报都用大号标题报道了有关刚闭幕的苏联最高苏维埃会议关于外交政策的决议、赫鲁晓夫的报告和葛罗米柯的声明的消息。
    美联社驻华盛顿记者罗杰斯报道：“美国官方人士非常冷淡地对待”苏联最高苏维埃会议提出的就裁军问题召开国际会议和最高级会议的建议。但是记者认为，“这种预先否定的回答绝不是最后的回答。”罗杰斯写道，在杜勒斯的面前出现的“可能是他一生道路上最困难的问题——苏联为了保证和平共处展开了广泛的进攻，同时美国的盟友又表现出动摇”。
    “纽约美国人日报”登载了国际新闻社引用“西方外交家的意见”的消息说，赫鲁晓夫在报告中呼吁保持东西方之间关系的现状，这是很“重要的”。“西方外交家认为赫鲁晓夫维持现状的发言，具有非常巨大的意义”。
    “纽约时报”刊登了驻华盛顿记者肯华赛受官方指使的带有显然煽动性的报道，这个报道引用“华盛顿外交人士”的话，重弹了所谓苏联的建议是“宣传性”的老调。但是肯华赛的报道仍然透露了华盛顿由于苏联“将继续争取和平共处的运动”而引起的明显的焦虑。
    英国许多报纸一致主张赶快接受苏联的建议，举行最高级会议。
    英国合作党机关报“雷诺新闻”谴责北大西洋集团首脑们执行冒险的军事计划，主张从速采纳苏联关于召开联合国大会特别会议来讨论裁军问题的建议，并且采纳苏联关于举行高级会议的建议，以便讨论在欧洲中部建立无原子武器地区问题和近东问题等。
    比万22日在“世界新闻报”社论中要求“世界政治家聚集一堂来商议达成协议的方法。”比万指出：美国对西方的领导“将证明是我们全体的灾难。必须对它进行抵抗”。
    “星期日快报”在社论中说，和俄国举行最高级谈判的要求，是全国占压倒多数人的不可抗拒的愿望。
    英国极右翼的报纸虽然有所保留，但是也主张同苏联谈判。
    法国“星期周报”着重指出苏联政府关于召开联合国大会特别会议或国际会议讨论裁军问题的建议，以及在资本主义国家和社会主义国家政府首脑举行更广泛会议以前苏联和美国代表举行会谈的建议。报纸指出，某些评论家认为，比起最近北大西洋公约组织理事会的参加者所提出的外长会议，苏联更重视苏美领导人的直接会谈。报纸补充说：“许多评论家认为，最高苏维埃会议上的两个演说（葛罗米柯和赫鲁晓夫的演说）是东西方间继续谈判的基础”。
    西德波恩“星期日世界报”在报道中强调指出，“北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议结束了四十八小时以后，苏联政府建议实行缓和紧张局势的政策作为回答”。“星期日世界报”和“波恩评论”都强调指出，赫鲁晓夫主张禁止战争作为解决国际争论问题的手段。
    意大利各报对苏联最高苏维埃通过的关于苏联政府外交政策的决议给予很大注意。“团结报”指出，赫鲁晓夫的发言和葛罗米柯的声明极其明显地表明了共产党、苏联政府和苏联人民满怀要求和平的热望。“报信者报”认为，苏联最高苏维埃的决议意味着苏联拒绝了北大西洋公约组织理事会巴黎会议所提出的谈判条件，可是“谈判的大门并未关上”。
    瑞典“斯德哥尔摩新闻”在社论中支持召开大国会议的主张。
    丹麦各报在刊载赫鲁晓夫发言的详细摘要中，特别指出赫鲁晓夫说到丹麦和挪威拒绝在自己领土上配置火箭基地是正确估计到当前局势。
