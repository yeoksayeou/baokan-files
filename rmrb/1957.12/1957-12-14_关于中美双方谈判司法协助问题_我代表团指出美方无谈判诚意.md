Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, December 12th: The Chinese delegation participating in the Sino-US ambassadorial talks issued the following press communique to the press on December 12th:

    At the 73rd meeting of the Sino-US ambassadorial talks held this morning, the Chinese representative suggested that China and the United States hold negotiations on the issue of judicial assistance.

    On September 3, 1957, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California sent a letter to the Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China, requesting judicial assistance in the case of "United States v. John W. Powell, Sylvia C. Powell, and Julian Schuman" currently being heard in the aforementioned court. The requested judicial assistance included helping the defendants' lawyers collect testimonies from Chinese witnesses in China. Because there is no agreement on judicial assistance between China and the United States, and the aforementioned request was not submitted through diplomatic channels in accordance with international practice, the Chinese Ministry of Justice had to return the original request to the US court. However, the Chinese Ministry of Justice indicated that if the Chinese and US governments agreed to conclude an agreement on judicial assistance, the aforementioned request could be considered. To date, the US authorities have not contacted China regarding judicial assistance in this case. However, according to newspaper reports on November 20, 1957, the US State Department has issued a valid passport to a lawyer representing one of the defendants in the Powell case to travel to China in order to collect testimonies.

    In view of this case and other cases that may arise in the future involving either country requesting judicial assistance, the Chinese government has taken the initiative to suggest that China and the United States hold negotiations to reach an agreement on the issue of providing judicial assistance to each other on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

    At this morning's meeting, the United States refused to give any consideration to China's draft proposal. It is the United States that is requesting judicial assistance, but now it refuses to discuss the proposal on this issue. This is a very regrettable matter.

    The following is the full text of the Chinese proposal: Statement (Draft) of the Agreement Between Ambassadors of the People's Republic of China and the United States of America on Judicial Assistance Negotiations, December 12, 1957. Ambassador Wang Bingnan, representing the Government of the People's Republic of China, and Ambassador Johnson, representing the Government of the United States of America, have agreed to announce:

    In order to provide each other with judicial assistance on the basis of equality and mutual benefit , the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the United States of America deem that it is necessary to reach an agreement on the issue of judicial assistance between the two countries. The two governments have decided to appoint experts to begin negotiations to discuss the substance and specific arrangements of an agreement on judicial assistance between the two countries.

### 关于中美双方谈判司法协助问题  我代表团指出美方无谈判诚意

    关于中美双方谈判司法协助问题
    我代表团指出美方无谈判诚意
    新华社日内瓦12日电　参加中美大使级会谈的中国代表团12月12日向报界发表新闻公报如下：
    在今天上午举行的中美大使级会谈第七十三次会议上，中国代表建议中美两国举行关于司法协助问题的谈判。
    在1957年9月3日，美国加利福尼亚北区区法院致函中华人民共和国司法部，要求对目前在上述法院中审理的“美国对约翰·威·鲍惠尔、锡尔维亚·坎·鲍惠尔和朱利安·舒曼”的控诉一案予以司法协助。所要求的司法协助包括帮助被告律师在中国收集中国证人的证词。由于中美两国之间没有关于司法协助的协定，而且上述的要求并不是根据国际惯例通过外交途径提出的，因此中国司法部不得不把原来的要求退回美国法院。但是，中国司法部表明，如果中美两国政府同意缔结一项关于司法协助的协定，对上述要求可以予以考虑。迄今美国当局还没有就这个案件的司法协助同中国方面进行接触。但是根据1957年11月20日的报纸消息，美国国务院已经发给鲍惠尔案中的一个被告律师赴中国旅行有效的护照，以便在中国收集证词。
    鉴于这个案件和将来可能发生的牵涉到两国中任何一国要求司法协助的其他案件，中国政府主动建议中国和美国举行谈判，以便就在平等互惠基础上彼此给予司法协助问题达成协议。
    在今天上午的会议上，美国拒绝对中国的建议草案给予任何考虑。要求给予司法协助的是美国方面，但是现在它又拒绝讨论关于这个问题的建议。这是十分遗憾的事情。
    以下是中国建议全文：中华人民共和国和美利坚合众国大使1957年12月12日关于司法协助谈判的一致协议的声明（草案）。王炳南大使代表中华人民共和国政府，约翰逊大使代表美利坚合众国政府协议宣布：
    为了在平等互惠基础上彼此给予司法协助，中华人民共和国政府和美利坚合众国政府认为有必要就两国司法协助问题达成协议。两国政府决定指派专家开始谈判，讨论两国司法协助协议的实质和具体安排。
