Young People are More Lovable Now
By our reporter Lu Chaoqi

I visited the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant once in late September. When I went again at the end of November, I was astonished to discover how much the plant had changed in two months! The management structure had been streamlined; the leadership style had changed; previously, employees lived in public housing without paying rent, water fees, or furniture fees, but now they were all charged; previously, everyone had a haircut subsidy of 25 cents per month, but now it was gone; previously, family members received free medical treatment, but now they paid; ... However, I felt that the biggest change was in the thinking of the workers, especially the young workers. Many people had changed so much that they were almost unrecognizable.

Liu Guilan Became Redder
I want to start with the changes in Liu Guilan.

Liu Guilan is a female fitter in the repair workshop and the propaganda committee member of the Communist Youth League branch. In the early stages of the rectification movement, she had many incorrect ideas. For example, the factory showed movies twice a week, and sometimes even an extra show on Sundays, but she was not satisfied, saying, "Why not add a play?" The workers' representative assembly agreed to charge rent and water fees for public housing, but she was also dissatisfied, saying, "This costs money, that costs money, it's better not to get a promotion!"

In early October, Liu Guilan participated in a rural visit organized by the factory, visiting the three villages of Xiyingfang, Wanggezhuang, and Manjinyu in Laishui County, Hebei Province. These three villages were all old revolutionary base areas, and most of the farmers had fought against the Japanese and the Kuomintang, shedding blood and sweat for the revolution. Now, the villagers were extremely motivated to build socialism, giving the best grain to the state, and both men and women were building reservoirs day and night. In Xiyingfang Village, Liu Guilan asked a middle-aged woman, "Is 360 catties of grain a year enough to eat?" The woman said, "It depends on how you eat. You can add some vegetables or eat some porridge during the slack season. Before liberation, not to mention 360 catties, we didn't even have 100 catties! Now, when we produce grain, we can't just think about eating it ourselves, we also have to support the country in building socialism!"

That night, Liu Guilan tossed and turned, unable to sleep. She thought to herself, the villagers made contributions to the revolution in the past, and now they not only don't ask the state for this or that, but they also think about the country in everything. I, a worker who only entered the factory in 1951, my contribution to the country is not as great as the villagers, and my life is better than the villagers, but I still reach out to the state for this and that, never satisfied. After returning to the factory, she said to everyone, "In terms of hard work and frugality, in terms of socialist consciousness, some of our workers, including myself, are falling behind the peasants!"

Since then, Liu Guilan has had a more correct view of many issues. At the debate on welfare issues, she became an active advocate for collecting rent, collecting water fees, and abolishing unreasonable benefits such as haircut subsidies. She felt that showing movies three times a week was too much and asked to reduce it to twice. In production, she not only became more conscientious and responsible than before, but also bravely criticized those who turned off the machines before the end of the shift and didn't work even half a minute extra. Many workers said, "Liu Guilan has 'reddened'."

This Can't Go On
It wasn't just Liu Guilan who had "reddened." When I visited for the first time, the workers were debating the question of whether or not to compare the current life with the past.

Most of the older workers advocated making the comparison. They said, "Don't be afraid of not knowing the goods, just be afraid of not comparing them. If you don't compare the current life with the past, you won't know how happy today's life is." However, some young workers opposed this view. They said, "What era was the past? What era is the present? Comparing the present with the past is looking backward, it's going in reverse!" Some people even said to the older workers, "You keep talking about comparing with the past, who told you to be unlucky and born at the wrong time!"

The young repair worker Jia Hongyin was also against the comparison. He became more and more particular about food, and the more money he had, the less he had enough. In 1951, when he first came to the factory from the countryside, he earned sixteen yuan a month. In addition to his own food and pocket money, he could send three yuan back home. Later, he was promoted to third-grade worker and earned forty-six yuan a month, but he didn't even have money to buy clothes. Now he is promoted to fifth-grade worker and earns ninety yuan a month. After sending thirty yuan home, the remaining sixty yuan supports a family of three, and he spends it all every month, sometimes not even enough. When he first heard that rent was going to be collected, he was dissatisfied, saying, "Working for the country, and still collecting rent?"

After listening to the report on the rural visit, he, like many young people, thought about a question: "The lives of the peasants are not as good as ours, why are they so satisfied and have no complaints?" Someone told him, "It's very simple, as the saying goes, 'Once the wound is healed, the pain is not forgotten.' Having suffered in the past makes them feel that today's life is not easy to come by, and that today is really very different from the past..."

Jia Hongyin thought about these words, and then thought about the changes in his own life in recent years, and was greatly surprised: before, he couldn't spend sixteen yuan a month, but now he couldn't spend ninety yuan a month, wasn't his life a little corrupt? Later, in a symposium, he said, "Of course we have to compare with the past. If we don't compare, there will be no end to the demands on life, only comparing who eats well and wears well, and not using our minds properly in production, this can't go on!"

Since then, Jia Hongyin has really started to live a frugal life. In the past, he didn't think it was tasty if he didn't smoke good cigarettes, but now he thinks cheaper ones are also tasty; and he has started to save money in the bank. In the past, he had echoed the opinions of some apprentices, saying that "a living allowance of twenty-eight yuan a month is too little," but now he says to the apprentices, "When I was an apprentice, I couldn't spend sixteen yuan a month, and you get twenty-eight yuan, is it still too little?"

Don't Try to Shake My Will
Like Jia Hongyin, many young workers began to live a simple life, and this became a trend. In the past, some young workers always ate Grade A or Grade B dishes in the cafeteria. If they didn't have enough money, or if they were late, and could only buy Grade C or Grade D dishes, they would feel very embarrassed and hide in a corner where people wouldn't notice them to eat. Now, the situation is just the opposite. The number of people buying Grade A and Grade B dishes is decreasing day by day, and the number of people buying Grade C and Grade D dishes is increasing day by day. The workers of Boiler Team A and Electrical Team A have also made a pact to maintain a frugal life, urging each other not to eat Grade A dishes and to eat fewer Grade B dishes. In the electrical laboratory, there is a young worker named Zhang Zhongxin who has insisted on not eating Grade A or Grade B dishes for a month. One day, a comrade deliberately bought him a Grade A dish, but he firmly refused. He said, "Don't try to shake my will! Grade C and Grade D dishes are also of good quality!" A young repair worker named Li Guoshun also posted a big-character poster saying, "I have decided to reduce my daily food expenses from seven jiao to five jiao, and donate 3% of my salary to support agricultural construction for three years." He asked the leadership to help him with this matter.

According to the workers' demands, the cafeteria sells only coarse grains and vegetarian dishes for two days a week, which is very popular. According to the survey, the average daily income of the cafeteria in September was 375 yuan, in October it was 316 yuan, and in November it was 273 yuan, with the lowest day being only 201 yuan. The turnover of some stores that specialize in serving the factory has also decreased significantly. The turnover of the supply and marketing cooperative's non-staple food has dropped from more than 28,000 yuan per month to more than 14,000 yuan.

Frugal and thrifty householders are also respected among family members. Many workers have gone to the district people's committee office to request a reduction in the grain supply. Many people buy more coarse grains and less fine grains. A worker named Feng Enlu, with a family of eight, has an average monthly income of less than 8.5 yuan per person, and has long received subsidies from the trade union. Everyone felt that this was right, and he took it for granted. However, recently he asked the trade union to stop giving him subsidies, saying, "We can't rely on the state to solve all our difficulties, we can get through it if we are a little hardship." He built a wood-burning stove himself, and let his wife and children go up the mountain to pick up firewood.

Must Work Hard
In October, the factory organized workers to visit the Jingxi Coal Mine, the joint state-private Xinghua Drilling Machine Factory, the Dadong Medical Equipment Factory, and the local state-owned Metal Crafts Factory. Like visiting the countryside, the workers received another vivid education in running enterprises with diligence and thrift. Many workers compared their own working conditions and work attitude with those of other factories and mines, and felt very ashamed.

Chen Ruihua, an electrical testing worker who graduated from a secondary technical school, said: "In the past, I always thought that I couldn't learn anything by participating in manual labor, and I didn't want to do it. This time, I saw that the coal miners worked all day in that humid, sunless underground environment, the working conditions were worse than ours, and the labor intensity was greater than ours, but their work enthusiasm was higher than ours. For example, during the Spring Festival, some workers had already bought train tickets and were preparing to go home. But on the way, they heard the mine broadcast that the supply of civilian coal was insufficient, and the state called for increased coal production, so they automatically refunded their tickets. You see, what people think about is not 'what to get' or 'what to ask from the state,' but how to create more wealth for the state and help the country overcome difficulties. This has been a profound education for me. Now that I have been assigned to do the work of scraping grates, I must work hard."

Xia Gangyi, a young repair worker, often turned off the machines before the end of the shift and ran as soon as the quitting whistle sounded, not working even half a minute extra without overtime pay, until the early stages of the rectification movement. After visiting the coal mine, he said: "People's wages are lower than ours, and when they work, they don't have fresh air or sunshine, but their enthusiasm is very high. What about us? We don't lack anything, we just lack the working-class ideology!" Since then, his work attitude has changed greatly. When he doesn't finish his work at the end of the shift, he continues to work for another ten or twenty minutes, without caring about overtime pay. After hearing the report on visiting the local state-owned Metal Crafts Factory, the electrical repair workers examined themselves and said: "People regard broken temples as paradise, and their products are sold to twenty-four countries. We are just the opposite, we regard paradise as a broken temple. We have everything in the laboratory, but we put it away in a mess, lose it, break it, and when we need it, we can't use it, so we ask to buy new ones." They quickly cleaned up all the tools and instruments neatly, and also requested not to add the new instruments that they had requested from the leadership at the beginning of the venting, and to repair the old ones for use themselves.

Three Months of Rectification is Better than Three Years
Like Chen Ruihua and Xia Gangyi, there are many people who have raised their awareness and changed their style in the rectification movement. In September, in the early stages of the factory's venting, a worker released the opinion at a group meeting that "low-pressure boilers are like hell," and asked the leadership to improve working conditions. After the opinions of the group meeting were publicized, they were quickly opposed by many workers. They refuted that it was possible to suggest appropriate improvements to the working conditions of low-pressure boilers, but they could not be compared to hell. Before liberation, that was hell, and now it is much better than before. However, many young people agreed with the saying "low-pressure boilers are like hell," saying things like "working now is only missing the whip compared to the past!" and "working in low-pressure boilers is suffering!" Now, these voices are no longer heard, and learning from small and medium-sized factories to run enterprises with diligence and thrift, doing dirty work, and doing hard work has become the mainstream of the workers' thinking. Many coals were leaked in the Lian Tiao furnace every day. In the past, no one cared about it, and good coal and ash were washed away together with water. Now, when they find leaked coal, everyone rushes to carry it back to burn. It is estimated that at least one hundred tons of good coal can be saved a month.

A comrade said: "Three months of rectification is better than three years." This sentence is well said.

    年青人更可爱了
    本报记者　陆超祺
    我在9月底曾经访问过一次北京石景山发电厂。11月底再度去时，我吃惊地发现，这个厂在两个月之间起了多么大的变化啊！管理机构紧缩了；领导作风转变了；以前职工住公家房不收房租，不收水费和家具费，现在都收了；以前每人每月有二角五分钱的理发津贴，现在没有了；以前家属治病不花钱，现在花了；……。然而，我感到变化最大的，是工人特别是青年工人的思想。许多人变得简直认不出来了。
    刘桂兰变红了
    我想从刘桂兰的变化讲起。
    刘桂兰是修理车间的女钳工，共青团支部宣传委员。在整风初期，她有很多不正确的想法。比如厂里每星期放映二次电影，有时候星期天还加演一场，但她不满足，说：“为什么不加演一次话剧？”职工代表大会同意职工住公家房收房租、水费，她也不满意，说：“这也要钱，那也要钱，还不如不升级哩！”
    10月初，刘桂兰参加了工厂组织的农村访问团，访问河北省涞水县西营房、王各庄和满金峪三个村。这三个村都是老革命根据地，大部分农民都扛过枪打日本、打国民党，为革命流过血，流过汗。现在老乡们建设社会主义的干劲顶大，打了粮食拣好的交公粮，男的女的，不分白天黑夜地修水库。在西营房村，刘桂兰问一位中年妇女：“一年三百六十斤粮食够不够吃？”这位妇女说：“看你怎样吃法，在农闲的时候加点菜，或者吃点稀的就够了。解放以前，别说三百六十斤，连一百斤也没有啊！现在打粮食不能只顾自己吃，还得支援国家建设社会主义哩！”
    这夜刘桂兰翻来复去睡不好觉。心想，人家老乡过去对革命有功劳，现在不仅不向国家要这样要那样，还处处为国家着想。我，一个1951年才进厂的工人，论对国家的贡献，不如老乡大，论生活，比老乡好，还伸手向国家要这要那，老不知足。回厂后她跟大伙儿说：“论艰苦朴素，论社会主义觉悟，咱们有些工人，连我在内，可掉在农民后头了！”
    从此，刘桂兰对许多问题都有比较正确的看法了。在关于生活福利问题的辩论会上，她变成一个宣传收房租，收水费，取消理发津贴等不合理待遇的积极分子。她觉得一个星期放三次电影太多了，要求减少两次。在生产上，不仅比以前认真负责了，而且对那些不到点就关车，多半分钟也不干的人，也勇敢地提出批评。许多工人都说：“刘桂兰‘红’起来了。”
    这样下去还了得
    “红”起来的，何止刘桂兰一个人？我第一次去访问的时候，工人中正在争论这样一个问题：该不该拿现在的生活跟过去的比？
    一般老工人都是主张比的。他们说：“不怕不识货，只怕货比货。不拿现在的生活同过去比，就不会知道今天生活的幸福。”但是，有些青年工人却反对这种看法。他们说：“过去是什么时代？现在是什么时代？拿现在同过去比，就是向后看，就是开倒车！”有的人甚至当着老工人面说：“你们开口闭口就是比过去，谁叫你们倒霉，生的不是时候！”
    青年检修工人贾洪银也是反对比的。他越来越讲究吃，钱越多越不够花。1951年，他刚从农村进厂时，一个月挣十六块钱，除自己吃饭零用外，还可以给家里寄三块回去。后来升为三级工，每月挣四十六元钱，自己添衣服的钱都没有了。现在升为五级工，每月挣九十块钱，除寄给家里三十元，剩下的六十元，养三口人，月月花光，有时还不够用。开始听说要收房租，他不满意，说：“给国家干活，还收房租？”
    听了访问农村的报告以后，他像许多青年人一样，想着一个问题：“农民的生活不如我们的好，为什么他们很满意，没有怨言？”别人告诉他：“很简单，俗话说，‘好了疮疤忘不了痛’过去受苦受难，就觉得今天的生活来得不容易，觉得今天跟过去真大大不同了……”
    贾洪银想想这些话，又想想自己几年来生活的变化，不禁大吃一惊：以前一个月十六元用不完，现在一个月九十元不够用，可不是生活有点腐化起来了？以后，在一次座谈会上，他说：“当然得跟过去比。不比，对生活的要求就没个完，光比谁吃得好，穿得好，思想不好好用在生产上，这样下去还了得！”
    从此，贾洪银真的过起俭朴的生活来了。以前，他不吸好烟就觉得不够味，现在吸便宜点的也觉得够味了；而且开始在银行里存起钱来。过去，他曾附和一些徒工的意见，说“一个月二十八元生活补贴太少了，”现在，他对徒工说：“我学徒的时候，一个月十六块钱还用不完，你们拿二十八块钱，还少吗？”
    别想动摇我的意志
    同贾洪银一样，许多青年工人开始过起朴素的生活来了，并且形成了风气。过去，有些青年工人在食堂里吃饭，总是吃甲菜或乙菜，要是钱不够，或者去晚了，只能买丙菜或丁菜，竟然觉得很难为情，躲到人们不注意的角落里去吃。现在情形刚好相反。买甲菜和乙菜的人一天比一天少，买丙菜和丁菜的人一天比一天多。锅炉甲班和电气甲班的工人，还订了保持俭朴的生活公约，互相督促，不吃甲菜，少吃乙菜。电气实验室有个叫张忠信的青工，已经坚持了一个月不吃甲、乙菜，有一天，有一位同志故意代他买个甲菜，他坚决不要。他说：“你别想动摇我的意志！丙菜、丁菜质量也不低呀！”有个叫李国顺的青年检修工人，还贴了一张大字报，说“我决定把每天的伙食费从七角降到五角，每个月献出3％的工资支援农业建设，献三年。”他要求领导上协助他办理这件事。
    食堂根据工人们的要求，每周有两天只卖粗粮和素菜，很受欢迎。据调查，9月份食堂每天平均收入三百七十五元，10月份为三百十六元，11月份为二百七十三元，最低的一天只有二百零一元。专门为工厂服务的一些商店的流水额也显著下降，供销合作社副食品流水额已由每月二万八千多元降到一万四千多元。
    在家属中，凡是勤俭持家的也受到尊敬。不少工人都跑到区人民委员会办事处去，要求降低粮食供应量。不少人多买粗粮，少买细粮。有个叫做冯恩禄的工人，一家八口，每人每月平均收入不到八元五角，长期受工会的补助。大家都觉得这是应该的，他也习以为常了。但是，最近他却要求工会停止给他补助，他说：“有困难不能都依赖国家解决，艰苦点就过去了。”他自己砌了一个烧柴的炉灶，让妻子、孩子上山捡柴烧。
    一定好好干
    10月间，厂里组织工人参观京西煤矿，参观公私合营兴华钻探机厂、大东医疗器械厂和地方国营金属工艺厂。像参观农村一样，工人们又受到一次生动的勤俭办企业的教育。许多工人都把自己的劳动条件和劳动态度跟别的厂矿相比，觉得很惭愧。
    中等技术学校毕业的电气试验工人陈瑞华说：“我过去老认为参加体力劳动学不到什么，不愿干。这次看见煤矿工人们整天在那潮湿的没有阳光的地下干活，劳动条件比我们差，劳动强度比我们大，可是人家的劳动热情却比我们高。例如春节，有的工人已买好火车票，准备回家。但在路上听到矿里广播民用煤供应不足，国家号召增产煤，就自动把车票退了。你看，人家脑子里想的，不是要‘取得什么’或者‘向国家要什么’，而是想办法多给国家创造财富，帮助国家克服困难。这给我的教育太深刻了，现在分配我去做刮炉排的工作，我一定好好干。”
    青年修理工夏刚义，直到整风初期，还是常常不到点就关车，下班气笛一响就跑，不发加点费，多半分钟也不干。参观煤矿回来后，他说：“人家工资比咱们低，干活的时候没新鲜空气，没阳光，干劲顶大。咱们呢？什么也不缺，就是缺点工人阶级思想！”从此，他的劳动态度大变，下班的时候活没干完，再继续干它十分二十分钟，也不计较加点费了。电气检修工人听了参观地方国营金属工艺工厂的报告以后，检讨说：“人家把破庙作天堂，产品行销二十四个国家。咱们刚好相反，把天堂当作破庙，实验室里样样都有，可是我们乱放一气，丢的丢，坏的坏，需要的时候用不着，就要求买新的。”他们很快把所有的工具仪器收拾得整整齐齐，在鸣放初期要求领导上添置的新仪器，也要求不添置了，自己修理旧的来用。
    整风三月胜过三年
    像陈瑞华、夏刚义一样，在整风中提高觉悟，改变作风的人很多。9月间，工厂鸣放初期，有个工人在小组会上放出“低压锅炉像地狱”的意见，要求领导上给改善劳动条件。小组会的意见公布后，很快就受到很多工人的反对。他们驳斥说，建议适当改进低压锅炉的劳动条件是可以的，但不能比作地狱，解放以前那才是地狱，现在已经比以前好得多了。但是，也有不少青年人赞同“低压锅炉像地狱”的说法，说什么“现在的劳动比过去只差鞭子打！”什么“在低压锅炉工作就是受苦、受难、受罪！”现在，这种声音听不到了，向中小厂学习勤俭办企业，干脏活，干累活，已经成为工人的思想主流。练条炉里，每天都漏掉许多煤，过去谁也不管，任凭好煤和灰一起被水冲走。现在，发现有漏掉的煤，大家都抢着抬回来烧。据估计，一个月至少可以节省一百多吨好煤。
    有位同志说：“整风三月，胜过三年”。这句话讲得真好。
