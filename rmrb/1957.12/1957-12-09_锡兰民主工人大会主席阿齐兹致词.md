Chairman, brothers, and friends:

	On behalf of the Ceylon Democratic Workers' Congress and its 160,000 members scattered in factories and localities throughout the country, I extend congratulations to the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions. Through you, we express our good wishes of solidarity and friendship to the working class and people of this great country. I also take this opportunity to express our solidarity and friendship with the working class all over the world. Representatives of the working class from all over the world are now gathered in this great Beijing to attend this congress.

	Our trade union organization thanks the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for inviting us to attend the meeting of our Chinese brothers. This gives us not only the opportunity to see your country and its development, but also the opportunity to understand and learn about the great experiment of the socialist way of life. Your achievements have won the admiration of all those who care about human well-being. The progress you have made in such a short period of time has made us more convinced that the socialist system can not only solve the material welfare of the people, but also solve their cultural and spiritual improvement. Every line of Comrade Lai Ruoyu's report expresses your method and attitude in understanding and handling problems. I congratulate you on achieving working-class democracy. You are concerned about the material interests of the workers in completing the task of developing production, and also rely on the consciousness and sense of responsibility of the workers and the people of the whole country. This is commendable. The worker-peasant alliance you have formed in a country of 600 million people is beneficial to all mankind. We hope that you will successfully complete your great tasks. Your victory will strengthen the confidence of the people of Asia and Africa, and make them believe that only the socialist system can save them.

	Imperialism is in the process of dying. As its end draws nearer, it has to resort to all kinds of artificial respiration. It is not only desperate, but also clearly shows that it is. Last month, an international labor organization regional meeting was held in New Delhi, and strangely enough, it was called the Asian Regional Meeting. Which countries attended this meeting as part of Asia? It turned out to be Britain, France, Portugal, the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand. I hope you will not misunderstand that I am trying to change geography, and don't be surprised that even the United States of America is considered part of Asia and participated in this meeting as a formal member. But China was not allowed to participate. According to the imperialists, China is not part of Asia. Sometimes, desperation can make people blind, and imperialism actually refuses to face the existence of 600 million Chinese people, who account for a quarter of the world's population and more than half of Asia's population. In this way, China is excluded from world affairs, and even from Asian affairs, due to the tricks and manipulations of Western imperialism. However, no matter what means they take to exclude China, China's train of progress is clearly moving forward.

	No matter what the United States does, no matter what the International Labor Organization does, the Chinese people are still building and solving their problems at a fast speed.

	Chinese brothers, we people from underdeveloped regions cannot compare with your speed of construction and degree of organization in the past few years. But we can assure you that we cherish the same aspirations as you, and you can count on us to move forward hand in hand with you in the common struggle against imperialism.

	Regarding the relationship between Ceylon and China, the people of our country have always adopted a friendly attitude towards the Chinese people. The people of Ceylon have always loved and admired the Chinese people.

	Our country was one of the first countries to recognize New China. Our country was the first to break through trade barriers, regardless of the intimidation of our rubber customers—the imperialists, and conduct rubber and rice trade with you. Since the Bandaranaike government came to power in Ceylon in 1956, the relations between the two governments of China and Ceylon have always been established on a normal basis. We have not only established diplomatic relations with China, but also lifted restrictions on travel between Ceylon and China. Now, Chinese friends can freely visit our country, and we can also enjoy the hospitality of Chinese friends without reservation. Our people regard the Chinese people as the bastion of the Asian continent. The heroic struggle of the Chinese people to drive imperialism out of their land will always be admired. The struggle against imperialism will always be considered a common cause.

	Based on these circumstances and reasons, I congratulate you at this congress. Long live China! May the Chinese people and the people of all countries hold high the torch together and advance for the freedom of all countries and the liberation of all mankind!

### 锡兰民主工人大会主席阿齐兹致词

    锡兰民主工人大会主席阿齐兹致词主席，兄弟们，朋友们：
    我谨代表锡兰民主工人大会和它的散布在全国各个工厂和各个地方的十六万会员，向中国工会第八次全国代表大会表示祝贺。我们通过你们，向这个伟大国家的工人阶级和人民表达我们的团结和友谊的良好愿望。我也利用这个机会表达我们对全世界工人阶级的团结和友谊。全世界工人阶级的代表现在聚集在这个伟大的北京，参加这次大会。
    我们的工会组织感谢中华全国总工会邀请我们参加中国兄弟们的会议。这使我们不仅有机会来看一看你们的国家和它的发展，而且也使我们有机会了解和学习关于社会主义生活方式的伟大实验。你们的成就赢得了所有关心人类幸福的人们的钦佩。你们在这么短促的时期内所取得的进步，使我们更加相信社会主义制度不仅能够解决人民的物质福利问题，而且也能够解决他们在文化上和精神上提高的问题。赖若愚兄弟的报告的每一行字都表达了你们认识问题和处理问题的方法、态度。我祝贺你们实现了工人阶级民主。你们一方面关心工人在完成发展生产任务时的物质利益，同时也依靠工人和全国人民的觉悟和责任感。这一点是值得称赞的。你们在六亿人口的国家中所结成的工农联盟，对全人类都是有益的。我们希望你们能很好地完成你们的伟大的任务。你们的胜利将加强亚洲和非洲人民的信心，使他们相信，只有社会主义制度才能够使他们得救。
    帝国主义是处在垂死的过程中。在它的末日越来越近的时候，它不得不借助于各种各样的人工呼吸。它不仅是绝望的，而且明白表现出确是如此。上月中，在新德里举行了一次国际劳工组织的区域会议，很奇怪的是，它叫做亚洲区域会议。是哪些国家作为亚洲的一部分出席这个会议呢？原来是英国、法国、葡萄牙、荷兰、澳大利亚和新西兰。我希望你们不会误会，认为我要改变地理，同时不要奇怪，连美利坚合众国也被算作亚洲的一部分，以正式会员的资格参加这次会议。但是中国却没有被允许参加。根据帝国主义者的说法，中国并不是亚洲的一部分。有些时候，绝望往往会使人变成瞎子，帝国主义竟然拒绝正视占世界人口四分之一和占亚洲人口一半以上的中国六亿人民的存在。这样，由于西方帝国主义的诡计和操纵，就把中国排斥在世界事务之外，甚至排斥在亚洲事务之外。但是，不管他们采取任何手段来排斥中国，中国的进步列车显然还是在向前奔驰。
    不管美国怎么做，不管国际劳工组织怎么做，中国人民还是以快速度进行建设和解决他们的问题。
    中国兄弟们，我们从不发达地区来的人们，实在无法和你们过去几年来的建设速度、组织程度相比。但是我们可以向你们保证，我们怀抱着和你们相同的愿望，你们可以指望我们和你们在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中手牵着手地向前迈进。
    对于锡兰和中国的关系，我国人民对中国人民始终采取友好的态度。锡兰人民对中国人民始终是热爱和钦佩的。
    我们国家是第一批承认新中国的国家之一。我们国家是第一个不顾我们橡胶的顾客——帝国主义者的恐吓而冲破贸易障碍，和你们进行橡胶和大米交易的国家。自从1956年班达拉奈克政府在锡兰执政后，中锡两国政府之间的关系就始终建立在正常的基础上。我们不仅和中国建立了外交关系，也取消了在锡兰和中国之间旅行的限制。现在，中国朋友能够自由地访问我国，我们也能够毫无保留地享受中国朋友的款待。我们人民把中国人民看作亚洲大陆的堡垒。中国人民把帝国主义从自己的土地上赶走的英勇斗争，将永远受到敬佩。反帝国主义的斗争将永远被认为是一个共同的事业。
    我根据这些情况和原因，在这次代表大会上向你们祝贺。愿中国万岁！愿中国人民和世界各国人民一起高举火炬，为一切国家的自由和全人类的解放前进！
