Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 28th (TASS dispatch): "New York Times" Washington correspondent Reston reported that although Secretary of State Dulles said the government is studying how to respond to a series of recent Soviet peace proposals, many indications suggest that "there are some fundamental disagreements among (American) government leaders and with NATO allies on how to answer Moscow's disarmament proposals."

It is said that the President's advisor on disarmament issues, Stassen, firmly advocates that Dulles draft new disarmament proposals to submit to the President for review. He advocates that Dulles should be more proactive in establishing direct contact with the Soviet Union to reach an agreement on limiting armaments. However, Dulles expressed disagreement with this proposal.

Reston said that Stassen accused Dulles of rejecting the Soviet proposal to establish a permanent disarmament committee including all members of the United Nations. Dulles said that such an institution would be too large for negotiations, while Stassen said that the Soviet proposal stipulates that the US and the Soviet Union can conduct bilateral consultations, if both parties are willing.

Reston wrote: "While the government is 'studying' how to answer Bulganin's letters, there is no doubt that those who support Stassen, who believe that negotiations with the Soviet Union to discuss disarmament proposals may be effective, are divided on this issue with those who support Dulles."

Reston also said that differences of opinion also exist between some allied government leaders and Dulles. "Some allied leaders have expressed their willingness to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union to discuss various issues, including Bulganin's proposal to conclude an agreement on not stationing nuclear weapons in a wide area of Central and Western Europe." He said, "After Christmas, Western allies may reach some new compromise agreement on how to act, while formulating a response to Bulganin's other proposals. However, at present, those who support Dulles and are not enthusiastic about negotiating with Moscow have the upper hand."

Reston also said that differences of opinion exist among leaders in the State Department on how to treat Soviet peace initiatives.

    如何对待苏联的和平倡议
    史塔生同杜勒斯争吵
    美国的“盟国”负责人也和杜勒斯有分歧
    据新华社29日讯　塔斯社纽约28日讯：“纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者赖斯顿报道，虽然国务卿杜勒斯说，政府正在研究如何答复苏联最近提出的一系列和平建议，但是许多方面都表明，“（美国）政府领导人之间以及同北大西洋公约组织盟国之间在如何回答莫斯科的裁军建议问题上都有着某些基本的分歧”。
    据说，总统的裁军问题顾问史塔生坚决主张杜勒斯拟定新的裁军建议，提交总统审核。他主张杜勒斯要更加主动和苏联建立直接接触，以便就限制军备问题达成协议。但是杜勒斯对这个主张却表示不同意。
    赖斯顿说，史塔生指责杜勒斯拒绝苏联提出的关于建立一个包括联合国全体成员国在内的常设裁军委员会的建议。杜勒斯说，对于谈判来说，这样的机构显得太大，而史塔生说，苏联的建议中规定苏美两国可以进行双边磋商，只要双方愿意的话。
    赖斯顿写道：“当政府正在‘研究’如何回答布尔加宁的信件的时候，毫无疑问，那些拥护史塔生的、认为同苏联举行关于讨论裁军建议的谈判可能有效果的人，同拥护杜勒斯的人在这个问题上发生了分裂。”
    赖斯顿还说，一些盟国政府负责人同杜勒斯之间也存在着意见分歧。“一些盟国负责人表示愿意开始同苏联谈判，来讨论各方面的问题，其中包括布尔加宁提出的缔结关于在中、西欧广大地区内不存放核武器的协议的建议。”他说，“圣诞节之后，西方盟国之间可能就如何行动问题达成某种新的折衷协议，同时拟定好对布尔加宁其他建议的答复。不过在目前，是那些拥护杜勒斯的、不热心于同莫斯科谈判的人占上风。”
    赖斯顿还说，在国务院领导人之间，对于如何对待苏联的和平倡议也存在着意见分歧。
