Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 23rd. Tens of thousands of railway construction workers, with a high sense of responsibility to the country and the people, overcame the severe diseases of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway with heroic spirit, ensuring the quality of the line met design standards.

According to materials obtained from recent scientific appraisals using vibrators on the entire line, the quality and stability of the tracks in both the northern and southern sections have reached excellent and good levels, respectively. Currently, the speed of trains on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is roughly equivalent to that of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, running at about 50 kilometers per hour. The throughput capacity of the line is also gradually increasing. So far this year, the freight volume has increased more than twofold compared to 1956, the initial period of disease treatment.

The sections of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway with diseases were concentrated in the more than 360 kilometers between Baoji and Guangyuan. The geology and topography of this section are extremely complex. There are seismic zones and ancient landslide and collapse areas. The geological structure has been damaged, and the rocks along the line are severely weathered, with abundant rainfall and groundwater. These latent adverse geological factors are the main root causes of the large number of diseases. In addition, certain design and construction deficiencies of the construction department also contributed to the occurrence of diseases. Since the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway entered this section in 1954, a total of 2,136 large and small disease work sites of various types, such as hillside slides, natural collapses, debris flows, and flash flood scour, have been discovered here. A serious case such as the collapse of the Dujiaba hillside, resulted in a single collapse of 100,000 cubic meters of earth and rock, pushing the railway tracks into the heart of the Jialing River, which temporarily interrupted the line.

In the past two years, the design and construction departments involved in building this railway have invested enormous technical resources to fight for improving the quality of the line. Collapse Treatment Committees and on-site design teams were formed in both the northern and southern sections to specifically handle the design and construction of disease work sites. Even after the north and south sections were connected and the entire line was opened to traffic in July last year, more than 50,000 workers remained on the line to treat the diseases. They used 30 drilling rigs and thousands of large and small mechanical equipment to adopt various treatment plans for different diseases. In the Fengzhou to Guangyuan section alone, the amount of earth and stone involved in the slope brushing project to protect the hillsides on both sides of the line from collapsing reached 3.7 million cubic meters. This amount of earth and stone could be used to build a city wall 5 meters high, 10 meters wide, and 74 kilometers long. In order to eliminate the harm of mountain water and groundwater to the lines in Baishui River, Matiawan and other places, the workers drilled vertical wells and built horizontal tunnels, up to tens of meters deep, in the nearby mountains or on the surface, and then supplemented them with masonry, discharging hundreds of tons of groundwater every day, thereby protecting the stability of the roadbed.

Now, the disease work sites on the entire line have been basically completed. Ming tunnels have been repaired or retaining walls have been built in the collapsed sections; drainage ditches and blind ditches have been built in places where water disasters have occurred; the weathered rocks on the mountain tops threatened by large collapses have been removed to restore stability to the mountain tops; and groups of protective structures can be seen in the severely diseased areas such as Tanjiachuang.

The Ministry of Railways attached great importance to and promptly adopted measures to treat the diseases. In April 1955, after Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan led Chinese and Soviet railway experts to inspect the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, he immediately ordered Chief Engineer of the Engineering General Bureau Chen Zhijian and Chief Engineer of the Design General Bureau Lin Shibo to form a team, and also absorbed relevant Soviet experts to participate, in the second half of 1955 to the Baoji-Chengdu Railway line, in coordination with the person in charge of design, construction, etc., to conduct a detailed inspection and proposed a plan for radical treatment; In April 1956, Zhang Jingzhi, Director of the Engineering General Bureau, was sent to lead other cadres and the Ministry of Railways construction consultant Zaqandaev to inspect the Baoji-Chengdu line, and many major design and construction issues were resolved on the spot; Subsequently, Chen Zhijian, Lin Shibo, and others went to the Baoji-Chengdu line again to inspect the work. In May 1957, Vice Minister of Railways Lü Zhengcao, Wu Jingtian, Director of the Design General Bureau Liu Changhan, and the heads of the Engineering General Bureau and the Infrastructure Bureau, inspected the project quality on the Baoji-Chengdu line for the last time.

At present, after the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has been treated for diseases, the entire line has been completely renewed, and passenger and freight transportation has been unimpeded. The most severely diseased section of the line also withstood the test of unprecedented torrential floods and rainstorms this year, which have not occurred in more than 20 years, and no major collapses or long-term interruptions in traffic occurred.

    数万筑路英雄战胜沿线严重病害
    宝成铁路畅通无阻
    新华社成都23日电　数万名筑路职工本着对国家和人民高度负责的精神，以英雄的气概战胜了宝成铁路的严重病害，使线路的质量达到了设计标准。
    根据最近在全线线路上利用震动器进行科学鉴定所得的材料，证明南北两段的线路质量和稳固程度，已经分别达到了优良和良好的等级。现在宝成铁路运行车辆的速度已同成渝铁路大致相等，每小时行驶五十公里左右；线路的通过能力也正在逐步提高，今年到目前为止的货运量，比整治病害初期的1956年增加了两倍多。
    宝成铁路发生病害的地段，集中在宝鸡到广元的三百六十多公里之间。这一段的地质地形极其复杂，这里有地震区和古老的滑坡、坍方地带，地质构造受到了破坏，同时沿线岩石风化严重，降雨量和地下水也很多。这些潜伏着的地质不良因素，是造成大量病害发生的主要根源；加上修建部门某些设计和施工的不当，也助长了病害的产生。从1954年宝成铁路施工进入这一地段以后，在这里先后发现了山坡滑动、自然崩坍、流石流泥、山洪冲刷等多种类型的大小病害工点二千一百三十六处。严重的如杜家坝山坡坍塌，一次就坍下十万方土石，把铁路钢轨推到嘉陵江的江心，曾使线路行车暂时中断。
    最近两年里，修建这条铁路的设计部门和施工部门投入了庞大的技术力量，为改善和提高线路的质量而斗争。南北两段都组成了坍方处理委员会和现场设计组，专门处理病害工点的设计、施工等问题。即使在去年7月南北接轨全线贯通以后，这条铁路仍然有五万多工人继续留在线路上整治病害。他们使用了三十台钻探机和数千部大小机械设备，针对不同病害，采取各种处理方案。仅凤州到广元段，为保护线路两旁的山坡不致坍塌，所进行的刷方工程的土石方数量即达三百七十万方。这些土石方可以修筑成一条高五公尺、宽十公尺、长七十四公里的城墙。为解除白水江、马蹄湾等线路遭受山体水和地下水的侵害，职工们在附近山体或地表上打直井、修横洞，深达数十公尺，然后加以补砌，每天泄出上百吨的地下水，从而保护了路基的稳定。
    现在，全线的病害工点已经基本整治竣工。原来坍塌的地段，修好了明洞或砌了挡土墙；在水患为害的地方，修了排水沟和盲沟；有大塌方威胁的山头，采取削掉山头风化石的方法，使山顶恢复稳定；在谈家庄等病害严重的地段，可以看到成群的防护建筑物。
    铁道部非常重视并及时地采取了整治病害的措施。1955年4月，铁道部部长滕代远率领中苏两国铁路专家视察宝成路以后，随即令工程总局总工程师陈志坚、设计总局总工程师林诗伯等组成小组，并且吸收有关苏联专家参加，在1955年下半年到宝成路沿线，协同主管设计、施工的负责人等，进行详细检查，提出了根治的计划；1956年4月又派工程总局局长张静之，率领其他干部和铁道部施工顾问扎岗达也夫等到宝成线检查，并且就地解决了不少设计、施工等重大问题；随后，陈志坚、林诗伯等再度到宝成线检查工作。1957年5月，铁道部副部长吕正操、武竞天和设计总局局长刘昌汉，以及工程总局、基建局负责人，最后又一次到宝成线检查了工程质量。
    目前，宝成铁路经过整治病害以后，全线面貌已焕然一新，客货运输已经做到畅通无阻。病害最严重的一段线路，在今年还经受了二十多年来未有的特大洪水和暴雨的考验，没有发生大坍塌和较长时间中断行车的现象。
