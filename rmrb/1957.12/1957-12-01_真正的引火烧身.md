Truly Setting Oneself on Fire
　　Shi Yitao

　　Mobilizing the masses to speak out freely and fully is to enable the leadership to conduct major rectification and major reforms. There is a very vivid saying about the relationship between the two, called "setting oneself on fire." Now, the great fire of the masses—that is, speaking out freely and fully—has already been burning vigorously, but the leadership's self-immolation—that is, major rectification and major reforms—in some units is still far behind.

　　Naturally, the problems raised by the masses in their speaking out are numerous and complex, and it is practically impossible to solve them in a relatively short period of time. They must be dealt with appropriately, according to their urgency and importance. However, some leading cadres are not lagging behind the speaking out due to such reasons, but for other reasons. The reason is that these leading cadres are afraid of pain, hesitating and lingering in the face of the fire, and have not yet made up their minds to truly throw themselves into the flames to be tempered.

　　Therefore, when the great fire of the masses' speaking out burns on them, these people adopt an attitude of not listening and not seeing. For example: Many opinions were given to the leaders at the level of directors and deputy directors in the big-character posters of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry. However, very few leading cadres above the level of directors and deputy directors read the big-character posters. Therefore, the masses reflected: "This is bureaucracy in the rectification campaign." In the rectification and reform, leading cadres should set themselves on fire, but these people cannot even talk about "watching the fire from the other side of the river," they have not even "watched" it, how can they talk about "setting themselves on fire"?

　　Some people have "watched the fire," but only "watched" it, and have not gone to the fire to "set themselves on fire." Specifically, they have not taken effective solutions to the problems raised by the masses. It is said that the leading cadres of some units in Fushun City adopted such an attitude towards the opinions expressed by the masses: they laughed off the "small problems" raised by the masses, thinking that "there is nothing worth paying attention to"; the problems raised by the masses regarding the style of leadership were considered "long-term problems" that "cannot be seen immediately." In this way, despite the vigorous speaking out of the masses, the real effect of rectification and reform can be imagined.

　　After speaking out freely and fully, it must be followed by major rectification and major reforms. The situation of not setting oneself on fire without being set on fire may be maintained temporarily, but it cannot be maintained forever. Since the masses dare to speak out freely and fully and criticize the shortcomings of the leadership's work, they will certainly urge those leaders who are unwilling to touch their own pain points to face up to their own shortcomings and mistakes. I hope these comrades will make up their minds and catch up! After this tempering, they will gain new improvements.

### 真正的引火烧身

　　真正的引火烧身
　　石一迢
    发动群众大鸣大放，是为了使领导上能够大整大改。两者之间有个很形象的说法，叫做“引火烧身”。现在，群众的大火——就是大鸣大放——已经蓬蓬勃勃地烧起来了，领导上的烧身——就是大整大改——有些单位却还远远地落在后面。
    自然，群众鸣放出来的问题，千头万绪，事实上不可能在较短的时间内——解决，必须分别缓急轻重，进行适当的处理。可是，有些领导干部并不是由于这样的原因，使自己和自己所领导的单位落在鸣放后面，而是另有别的原因在。这个原因就是这些领导干部害怕痛苦，在火的面前犹豫、徘徊，还没有下决心真正的投入到烈火中受到锻炼。
    于是，当着群众鸣放的大火烧到自己身上来的时候，这些人却采取了一种有耳不听、有目不视的态度。比如：建筑材料工业部的大字报中，给司局长级的领导干部提了很多意见。但是，司局长以上的领导干部看大字报的却寥寥无几，因此群众反映说：
  “这是整风中的官僚主义”。在整改中，领导干部应当引火烧身，这些人却连“隔岸观火”都谈不到，连“观”都没有“观”一下，怎么能谈得到“烧身”呢？
    有些人虽然“观火”了，但仅止于“观”而已，并没有到火中去“烧身”。具体说来，就是没有针对群众提出来的问题，进行确实有效的解决。据说，抚顺市有些单位的领导干部，对群众鸣放出来的意见就采取了这样的态度：群众提出的“小问题”，付之一笑，认为“没有什么值得注意的”；群众提出的关于领导作风方面的问题，又认为是“长期问题”，“马上表现不出来”。这样一来，尽管群众轰轰烈烈的鸣放，但真正整改的效果也就可想而知了。
    大鸣大放之后，必须继之以大整大改。不引火而不烧身的情况，也许可以暂时保持，但决不能永远地保持下去。群众既然敢于大鸣大放，批评领导工作的缺点，也一定会督促那些不愿触及自己痛处的领导人正视自己的缺点和错误。希望这些同志痛下决心，赶上来吧！经过这一番锻炼，将会使自己获得新的提高。
