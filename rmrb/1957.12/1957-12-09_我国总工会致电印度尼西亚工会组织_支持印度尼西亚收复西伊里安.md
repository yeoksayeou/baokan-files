Xinhua News Agency, December 8th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram on December 8th to the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union Federation, forwarded to all Indonesian trade union organizations and Sudibjo, Chairman of the Action Committee for the Liberation of West Irian, expressing firm support for the struggle of the Indonesian people and workers for the liberation of West Irian.

The telegram stated: "The United Nations General Assembly, manipulated by Western colonial countries, unreasonably rejected the proposal jointly put forward by eighteen Asian-African countries and Bolivia to seek a reasonable solution to the West Irian issue through Dutch-Indonesian negotiations. This is not only another instance of the United Nations violating its own Charter and abandoning its due responsibilities, but also condones the aggressive behavior of the Dutch colonialists, endangering Indonesian national independence and Asian peace. The Chinese workers and people are deeply indignant about this.

The recovery of West Irian is the sacred national right of the Indonesian people to strive for territorial sovereignty and integrity. Responding to President Sukarno's call, the patriotic boycott movement launched by people of all strata across the country against the colonialists is entirely just. The Indonesian worker brothers have once again demonstrated the working class's lofty patriotic enthusiasm and determination, and are driving out the remnants of Dutch colonialism entrenched on Indonesian territory. Your struggle has not only won the universal sponsorship and active support of people of all strata in Indonesia, but has also received the broadest sympathy and support from workers around the world and all peace-loving and freedom-loving people. The Chinese trade unions firmly support the just actions taken by the Indonesian people and workers to liberate West Irian and safeguard peace, and extend our highest respect to the Indonesian people and workers who are struggling."

    电报说：“联合国大会在西方殖民国家操纵下，无理否决了十八个亚非国家和玻利维亚联合提出的通过荷—印谈判求得合理解决西伊里安问题的提案，这不但是联合国又一次的违背了自己的宪章和放弃了自己应尽的责任，而且是放纵了荷兰殖民者的侵略行为，危害着印度尼西亚民族独立和亚洲和平。中国工人和人民对此感到十分愤慨。
    收复西伊里安是印度尼西亚人民争取领土主权完整的神圣的民族权利。响应苏加诺总统的号召，全国各阶层人民一致奋起进行的反对殖民者的爱国抵制运动是完全正义的，印度尼西亚工人兄弟再一次表现了工人阶级崇高的爱国主义热情和决心，正在驱逐盘踞在印度尼西亚领土上的荷兰殖民主义者的残余势力。你们的斗争不仅获得了印度尼西亚国内各阶层人民的普遍赞助与积极支持，而且也得到了全世界工人和一切爱好和平与自由的人民最广泛的同情与支持。中国工会坚决支持印度尼西亚人民和工人为解放西伊里安与维护和平所采取的正义行动，并向正在斗争中的印度尼西亚人民和工人致以崇高的敬意。”
