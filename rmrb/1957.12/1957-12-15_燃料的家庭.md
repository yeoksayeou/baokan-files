　　The Fuel Family
　　Gao Shiqi

　　In the fuel family, there are all sorts of characters, most of whom are engaged in combustion as a profession. According to their different personalities, they can be divided into three "houses": these are solid fuels, liquid fuels, and gaseous fuels.

　　In the solid fuel house, there are five brothers:

　　The eldest brother is called Wood. It grows in the forest, and lumberjacks cut it down. It is an important member of construction projects, and it is also the master of manufacturing various wooden objects. It can also make paper. Using it as fuel cannot be said to be a waste, but in rural areas and small cities, people still use it to cook and keep warm. It crackles in the fireplace, appearing very majestic, but in an instant, it turns into ashes.

　　The second brother is Anthracite, which is the hardest kind of coal. People call it "black gold." Its home is in the mine, and miners dig it out, transporting it to factories in train after train. Because it doesn't produce much smoke when it burns, and it doesn't leave much residue, people like to use it. It is also a useful industrial raw material. Chemists can use it to manufacture many new chemical products, such as various beautiful dyes, fragrant spices, and medicines.

　　The third brother is called Bituminous Coal. It also comes from the mine. When it burns, it emits a lot of smoke and leaves a lot of rocks and residue, which people hate. It should be prohibited from being used in urban residential areas. However, because it is produced in large quantities and is relatively cheap, it is mostly used in factories and locomotives.

　　The fourth brother is called Lignite. Its skin is like tree bark, and its whole body is brown. Like bituminous coal, it is also a king of smoke. In various parts of Europe, people cannot find the second and third brothers and have to use it as fuel.

　　These coal brothers all have a very ancient history. They are the remains of ancient animals and plants buried in the strata for countless years without air, slowly changing over time. Therefore, today we often find the shapes of ancient animals and plants on coal blocks.

　　Peat is their fifth brother. In the history of material change, it is younger than coal and not yet mature. Its appearance sometimes resembles lignite, and sometimes it resembles rotten wood. It was originally the incarnation of rotten plants. When burning, it emits a lot of smoke like lignite, so its burning value is very poor, but in places lacking coal, people have to use it to fill the gap.

　　Wood's son is Charcoal. It is obtained by burning wood in a furnace without air. The gas generated by burning wood is a useful chemical raw material. After releasing these gases, what remains is charcoal. Putting charcoal in a charcoal basin to start a fire makes it look radiant and very lovely. In the south where there is no heating equipment, it is used for heating. Although it has no flames, it often emits a colorless, odorless, and poisonous gas—carbon monoxide, which is very dangerous. If it is burned indoors, attention must be paid to it.

　　Bituminous coal's son is Coke. It is also obtained by burning bituminous coal in a furnace without air. It is relatively pure carbon, emitting light blue flames. Its workplace is in blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces, and it is a master of smelting iron and steel. Sometimes, it is also used in ordinary residences. The by-products of burning bituminous coal include coal tar and coal gas, which are valuable chemical industrial raw materials.

　　Now we come to the liquid fuel house. The famous figures in this house are kerosene and gasoline. They are both extracted from the petroleum family. Their main workplaces are in factories, cars, and airplanes. When they burn, they emit strong light and heat, and they are very easy to catch fire. Carelessness often leads to explosions.

　　Finally, we come to the gaseous fuel house. This is the famous coal gas and natural gas. Natural gas's old home is in mines and oil wells. Romania is the kingdom of natural gas. Zigong in Sichuan, China, is also a world-famous natural gas producing area. Generally speaking, natural gas must be refined to remove its impurities before it can be transported to where it is needed.

　　What about coal gas? As mentioned earlier, it is a by-product of coking furnaces. If we spray some water on hot coke, we can also get coal gas. Coal gas is the cleanest fuel. It emits a strong blue flame. It follows a certain route—through the gas pipe—to our kitchen. It is very convenient to light a fire, but it is also easy to catch fire and cause explosions. Coal gas poisoning accidents also occur easily, and we must be vigilant.

　　In the work of combustion, all fuels are inseparable from oxygen. Oxygen is the supporter of combustion. Without oxygen, there is no combustion phenomenon. Therefore, when talking about fuel, we must mention the contribution of oxygen.

　　In the work of combustion, we must pay close attention to heating. Every fuel has its ignition point. It will not burn if it does not reach its ignition point. For example, we cannot use matches and waste paper to burn coal blocks, but only wood chips.

　　Fuel is the food of industry. Without fuel, machines cannot start, and all industries will come to a standstill. In socialist construction, fuel bears a very important responsibility.

　　Now winter is coming, and the supply of fuel will become tight as the cold increases. Therefore, I have specially introduced all the characters in the fuel family one by one. We must pay more attention to cherishing them.

### 燃料的家庭

　　燃料的家庭
　　高士其
    在燃料的家庭里，有各样各色的人物，它们大半都是以燃烧为职业的。依照它们不同的性格，可以分为三大“房”：这些就是固体燃料、液体燃料和气体燃料。
    在固体燃料那一房，有五个兄弟：
    大哥名叫木材，它生长在树林中，是伐木工人把它砍伐下来的。它本是建筑工程中的重要成员，它也是制造各种木器的主人，它还会造纸。用它当燃料不能说不是一种浪费，但是在乡村和小城市里，人们还不断用它来烧饭和取暖，在壁炉里“必剥必剥”地响，显得十分威风，但顷刻之间，就化成灰烬了。
    二哥是无烟煤，这是最硬的一种煤，人们称呼它为“黑色的金子”。它的家住在矿山，矿工们把它挖掘出来，一列车一列车的运到工厂里去。因为它燃烧起来没有什么烟，而且也没有多少残渣，人们都喜欢用它。它也是一种有用的工业原料，从它的身上，化学家可以制造许多新的化学产品，例如各种美丽的染料、芬芳的香料和药品等。
    三哥叫做烟煤，它也是从矿山来的，它燃烧起来，会放出大量的烟，而且留下许多石块和残渣，人们都讨厌它。应当禁止它在城市住宅区使用。但是，因为它的产量多，又比较便宜，所以在工厂里和火车头上多用它。
    四弟唤做褐煤，它的皮肤像树皮一样，全身都是褐色，它和烟煤一样，也是发烟的大王。在欧洲各地人们找不到二哥和三哥，不得不用它来作燃料。
    这些煤的弟兄们，都有一段很古老的历史，它们都是远古时代动植物的残骸埋藏在地层下面，不见空气，已经有多少万万年之久，慢慢地变化而成。所以在今天，我们还时常在煤块上面，发现古代动植物的形状。
    泥炭是它们的五弟，在物质变化的历史中，它比煤年青，还不大成熟，它的外貌有时候很像褐煤，有时候又像枯烂的木头，它原来是枯烂植物的化身。在燃烧的时候，它和褐煤一样，放出很多烟，因而它的燃烧价值很差，但在缺少煤的地方，也只好用它来充数了。
    木材的儿子是木炭，它是把木材放在没有空气的炉子里燃烧而得来的。燃烧木材所发生的气体，是有用的化学原料。把这些气体放走以后，剩下来的就是木炭了。把木炭放在炭盆里生起火来，红光满面，非常可爱。在没有暖气设备的南方，都是用它来取暖。它虽然没有火焰，但是时常放出无色无味而有毒的气体——一氧化炭，这是很危险的，如果在室内燃烧，不能不加以注意。
    烟煤的儿子是焦炭，也是把烟煤放在没有空气的炉子里燃烧而得来的。它是比较纯净的炭，放出浅蓝色的火焰，它的工作场所，是在高炉和平炉，它是熔铁炼钢的能手。有的时候，在普通住宅里也用得着它。燃烧烟煤的副产物，还有煤焦油和煤气，这些都是宝贵的化学工业原料。
    现在我们讲到液体燃料那一房。这一房的著名人物就是煤油和汽油，它们都是从石油家里提炼出来的，它们的办公地点主要的是在工厂里、在汽车和飞机上。它们燃烧起来，能发出强烈的光和热，而且很容易着火，不小心往往会引起爆炸。
    最后，我们走到气体燃料那一房。这就是鼎鼎大名的煤气和天然气了。天然气的老家是在矿井和油井里。罗马尼亚是天然气的王国。我国四川的自流井，也是世界闻名的天然气产地。一般说来，天然气必须经过提炼，去掉它的杂质，才可以输运到需要的地方去。
    煤气呢？前面已经说过，它是炼焦炉里的副产物。如果我们在烧热的焦炭上喷一些水，也可以得到煤气。煤气是最干净的燃料，它会发出强烈的蓝色的火焰，它沿着一定的路线——通过煤气管，来到我们的厨房，点起火来，非常方便；但也容易走火，引起爆炸，煤气中毒的事故也很容易发生，我们不能不提高警惕。
    在燃烧的工作中，一切燃料都离不开氧气。氧是燃烧的支持者，没有氧就没有燃烧的现象。所以在谈燃料的时候，不能不提到氧的功绩。
    在燃烧的工作中，我们必须密切注意加热。每一种燃料都有它的着火点，不到它的着火点，是烧不起来的。例如：我们不能用火柴和废纸来烧煤块，而只能用木片。
    燃料是工业的粮食，没有燃料机器就不能开动，一切工业就要停顿。在社会主义建设中，燃料所负的责任是非常重大的。
    现在冬天来到了，燃料的供应，会随着寒冷的增加而紧张起来。所以我特地把燃料家庭里各种人物都一一介绍出来，对于它们，大家还必须加意爱护。
