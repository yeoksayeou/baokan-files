Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 28th: Representatives of various African colonies attending the Asian-African Solidarity Conference held a press conference in Cairo. At the press conference, they condemned the imperialist oppression of their countries and introduced the struggles of the people of these countries for independence.

    Hassan Dahni, the representative of Kenya, said: "From 1943 to the present, the British have killed tens of thousands of Kenyan patriotic heroes. Many leaders of national movements have been tortured in torture chambers. Families of patriotic heroes have been machine-gunned. The British colonialists have used all their strength to try to keep Kenya in their hands in order to exploit Kenya's wealth and people." He said, "We ask the Asian-African Solidarity Conference to support our people's right to independence."

    Dr. Moumie, the representative of Cameroon and chairman of the Cameroon People's Union, said: "We ask the Asian and African countries to rise up to protect the people of Cameroon, and we demand that our country be merged into a whole. At present, the British and French authorities dominate everything in our country, and they hinder the revival of Cameroon. The people of Cameroon are enslaved and oppressed. However, they are fighting for the independence of their country."

    Ali Rasheed, the representative of Zanzibar, said that the British authorities had prohibited Ali Mohsin, the leader of the Zanzibar Nationalist Party, and four other members of the party from attending the conference. Ali Rasheed said: "The people of Zanzibar strongly protest against these actions of the British." He pointed out that the Zanzibar delegation will raise the issue of supporting the people of Zanzibar in their struggle for independence at the conference.

    Ali Omur, chairman of the Uganda Student Union, said: "The people of Uganda resolutely demand that their country enjoy independence and be liberated from British rule. Britain is trying to form a federation of Uganda, Kenya and Tanganyika in order to control them. When the King of Uganda opposed this, the British drove him out of Uganda."

    The representative of Somaliland emphasized at the press conference: "The people of Somaliland demand that all imperialist troops withdraw from the territory of their country and that the various parts divided by the Italians, French, and British be linked together as a whole."

    Maurice Rasa Vafra, the representative of Madagascar, said: "French colonialists are rampant in Madagascar today. However, we demand independence, and we hope to start negotiations on this issue immediately."

    非洲各殖民地代表要求民族独立
    一致谴责帝国主义的奴役和压迫暴行
    新华社30日讯　塔斯社开罗28日讯：参加亚非团结大会的非洲各殖民地的代表在开罗举行了记者招待会，他们在记者招待会上谴责了帝国主义对他们国家的压迫，并且介绍了这些国家的人民争取独立的斗争。
    怯尼亚的代表哈桑·达尼说：“从1943年到现在，英国人杀害了成千上万的怯尼亚爱国志士。许多民族运动的领袖在刑讯室中受尽折磨。爱国志士的家属遭到机关枪扫射。英国殖民者用尽一切力量企图把怯尼亚抓在自己手中，以便剥削怯尼亚的财富和人民。他说，“我们要求亚非团结大会支持我国人民的独立权利。”
    喀麦隆代表、喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米博士说：“我们要求亚非国家起来保护喀麦隆的人民，我们要求把自己的国家合并成一个整体。现在，英国和法国当局在我国主宰一切，它们阻碍喀麦隆的复兴。喀麦隆的人民是被奴役和受压迫的。但是，他们正在为争取自己国家的独立而斗争。”
    桑给巴尔代表阿里·拉希德说，英国当局禁止桑给巴尔民族党的领袖阿里·莫辛和这个政党的其他四位党员出席这次大会。阿里·拉希德说：“桑给巴尔岛的人民群众坚决抗议英国的这些行动”。他指出，桑给巴尔岛代表团将在大会上提出关于支持桑给巴尔岛人民争取独立的问题。
    乌干达学生联合会主席阿里·奥姆尔说：“乌干达人民坚决要求自己的国家能享受独立，从英国统治下解放出来。英国企图把乌干达、怯尼亚和坦噶尼喀组成联邦，以便加以控制。当乌干达国王反对这件事的时候，英国人就把他赶出了乌干达。”
    索马里兰的代表在记者招待会上强调指出：“索马里兰的人民要求一切帝国主义的军队从自己国家的领土上撤退，并且把被意大利、法国和英国人为分裂开来的各个部分联结成一个整体”。
    马达加斯加的代表摩里斯·拉萨·瓦弗拉说：“法国殖民者今天在马达加斯加横行。但是，我们要求独立，我们希望立即就这个问题开始进行谈判。”
