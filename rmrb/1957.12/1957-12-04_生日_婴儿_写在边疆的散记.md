　　Birthday · Baby
    ——Notes from the Frontier
　　Gu Gong
    Birthday
    Today is "Golden Gyun Mami"'s [Note] birthday. The Tibetan road-building workers are all dressed in festive attire. The men wear leather hats embroidered with gold thread, and the women wear colorful scarves. They all gather on the grassy area by the river and sit down in circles.

    A couple who just got married at the construction site snuggle closely together. The man holds the woman's working hand and gently pats his own palm. The woman turns the man's face towards her and whispers something in his ear.

    A Tibetan woman wraps a three-month-old baby in a gray blanket. The baby opens its big, black, crystal-like eyes, gazing at this cheerful, warm world. A soldier peels a piece of candy and puts it in the baby's little mouth.

    There are also two little model workers who came with their parents to build the road. They are very popular with the soldiers, and everyone teases and chases them. The boy's velvet hat with a red string on top falls off. As he bends down to pick it up, three soldiers hug him at the same time. But the girl is still nimbly dodging and flashing! The little red button hanging on her ear is also fluttering and shaking back and forth! …

    The meeting begins. The commander—also the regiment commander—stands up and talks about the heroic deeds and glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army, as well as their determination to build Kangzang and defend the frontier… The deputy commander stands up and announces the conditions for meritorious service, announces the list of those who have won red flags, and announces the wages that each person should receive…

    At this time, the two little model workers, with serious faces, walk straight to the commander's front, beaming with joy, and proudly display the dazzling red flags. At this time, the Tibetan woman holding the baby, and the newlywed couple holding hands, all walk to the deputy commander's front and take over stacks of silver dollars. They also throw the silver dollars on the stones, listening with smiles to the crisp sound…

    After the meeting, the workers still gather on the grass for a long time, and red flags and colorful skirts are fluttering everywhere; loud songs are everywhere…
        In our arms
        We hold many silver dollars
        These are the sweat drops of our labor
        Bringing us joy...
        In our hearts
        We hold much joy
        This is the birthday of Golden Gyun Mami
        Bringing us poems...
      [Note] Golden Gyun Mami: means the soldier who opened the chains; that is, the People's Liberation Army.

    Baby
    A six-month-old baby has a thin belt tied around its waist, and the other end of the belt is tied to a straight green poplar tree. The baby crawls around on the carpeted ground alone, happily chasing one or two rolling walnuts.

    The baby's mother is a strong young woman. Half a year ago, she rushed to the road construction headquarters with her round belly. She insisted on participating in the road construction, no matter how many mouths tried to persuade her, no matter how many hands refused her, she remained unchanged: she must participate in road construction.

    Half a month later, she strapped her newborn baby to her back and silently joined the crowd to work. At first, others took away her iron shovel, but she picked up another one; others snatched her carrying pole, but she snatched another one.

    She loves the baby growing on her back; she also loves the road gradually extending under her feet. When she was commended, she received a red flag, and she proudly stuck this red flag on her baby's swaddling clothes.

    Now, this section of road is almost completed, and the Tibetan road-building workers are using her baby's pet name to name this section of the road; but she is using the place name of this section of the road as her baby's name.

　　生日·婴儿
    ——写在边疆的散记
　　顾工
    生日
    今天是“金君玛米”〔注〕的生日，筑路的藏族民工都穿着节日的盛装，男的戴着绣满金线的皮帽，女的披着五颜六色的彩巾，都聚到河边的草坝子上，一圈一圈地坐下了。
    有对在工地上才结婚的夫妇，亲密地依偎在一起，男的挽着女的劳动的手，轻轻地拍着自己的手心；女的用手把男的脸扭过来，附在他耳上轻轻地说着什么。
    有个藏族妇人，用灰色的毯子包裹着一个三个月的婴儿，婴儿睁大黑晶晶的眼，张望着这快活的温热的世界。一个战士剥了一颗糖，塞在婴儿的小嘴里。
    还有一对随父母一起来修路的小劳动模范，最受战士的欢迎，大家引逗着他俩，追逐着他俩。男孩子头上那顶钉着红头绳的绒帽掉了，他在弯身拾取的时候，被三个战士同时抱住了；但那个女孩子还是灵活地躲啊！闪啊！挂在她耳朵上的那颗小红钮扣，也在来回地飘啊！晃啊！……
    大会开始了，指挥长——由团长兼任，他站起来讲了讲解放军的英雄业迹，光荣传统，以及建设康藏、保卫边疆的决心……。副指挥长站起来宣布了立功条件，宣布了获得红旗的名单，宣布了每个人应该获得的工资……。
    这时，那对小劳动模范，已经绷紧了脸，笔端笔正地走到指挥长的面前，红着欢喜的脸，亮开了耀眼的红旗。这时，那个抱着婴儿的藏妇，手挽着手的新婚夫妇，都走到副指挥长的面前，接过了一叠叠银元。他们还把银元丢到石块上，笑嘻嘻地听着那清脆的声响……。
    散会以后，民工们仍然聚在草坝上久久不散，到处都是飘展的红旗，到处都是飘展的彩裙；到处都是响亮的歌声……。
        在我们的怀里
        揣着很多的银元
        这是我们劳动的汗珠
        带来的喜欢……
        在我们的心里
        揣着很多的喜欢
        这是金君玛米的生日
        带来的诗篇……
      〔注〕金君玛米：就是打开锁链的军人；就是解放军。
    婴儿
    一个六个月的婴儿，腰上拴着一根细带子，带子的另一头，拴在一棵直挺挺的青杨树上。婴儿独自在铺着毛毯的地上爬来爬去，快活地追逐着一两颗滚动的核桃。
    婴儿的母亲，是位健壮的少妇，她在半年前，捧着那圆圆滚滚的大肚子，急急忙忙地赶到了筑路指挥部，她吵着嚷着一定要参加修路，多少张嘴劝她，多少双手拒绝她，但她仍然毫不变挂：修路，一定要参加修路。
    半个月后，她把才生的婴儿扎在背上，便闷声不响地混进人群中干起活来了。起初，别人把她的铁铲夺掉，但是她又拾起另一把；别人把她挑土的扁担抢过去，但是她又抢过另一根。
    她爱在她背上的渐渐成长的婴儿；她也爱在她脚下渐渐延伸的公路。在评功的时候，她获得一面红旗，她就自豪地把这面红旗插在她婴儿的襁褓上面。
    现在，这段公路已经快要完成了，筑路的藏族民工们就拿她婴儿的乳名，来命名这段公路；但是她却把这段公路的地名，来作为她那婴儿的命名。
