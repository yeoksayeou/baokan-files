Xinhua News Agency, Kunming Telegram: "Work hard for ten years to build a new socialist countryside," this is the common determination of all the representatives at the Second Session of the First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Yunnan Provincial Committee, which closed on the 10th.

　　This meeting was held in conjunction with the provincial four-level cadre meeting. Starting from November 21st, the meeting studied the documents of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. In the spirit of rectification, it adopted the methods of extensive airing of views, free expression, and great debates to examine the various tasks of the province, focusing on agriculture, over the past year. During the meeting, more than 1,500 big-character posters were put up, raising more than 9,800 opinions, seriously criticizing right-leaning conservative ideologies within the Party. On the basis of unified understanding, the meeting determined the plan for a great leap forward in agricultural production next year and the development of agricultural production over the next ten years.

　　The meeting considered that during the First Five-Year Plan period, the province's grain output increased by 41%, and this year, despite extremely abnormal climate and rainfall conditions, output still increased by about 6%, which is a significant achievement. However, right-leaning conservative thinking was a prominent tendency on the agricultural production front this year. Basic water conservancy construction retreated compared to last year, and the planned planting area and output of major cash crops were not fulfilled. Major production increase measures such as changing the cultivation system, promoting new agricultural tools, and improving cultivation techniques were not carried out as resolutely and effectively as last year. The meeting believed that this is precisely a reflection of the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads on the agricultural production front. Some comrades, after the high tide of cooperativization, lowered their class vigilance and were not good at constantly adhering to the use of proletarian ideology to overcome bourgeois ideology and the conservative ideology of small producers. Furthermore, they underestimated the development speed of agricultural productive forces after cooperativization, one-sidedly emphasizing certain difficulties in the process of advancement, and even wavering and succumbing, which could not but affect the growth of the total value of agricultural production this year. The meeting pointed out that the force of habit of the bourgeoisie and small producers is the social root of this right-leaning conservative thinking. Therefore, adhering to the steadfastness of socialist principles, continuously resolving the struggle between the two roads through socialist great debates in the countryside, and correctly handling the contradiction between the advanced and the backward, and overcoming the conservative thinking of small producers, have become the fundamental guarantee for consolidating agricultural cooperatives and rapidly developing agricultural productive forces.

　　The meeting believed that in the province's more than 11,000 cooperatives, after the past three months of airing of views and debates, the socialist atmosphere in the countryside is becoming increasingly strong, and the appearance of places where the airing of views is thorough has been completely renewed. At present, 90% of the cooperatives in the province have been basically consolidated or relatively consolidated, and cadres have also accumulated experience in leading production. In addition, Yunnan Province has superior natural conditions and great production potential. As long as we criticize the capitalist tendencies of wealthy peasants and overcome right-leaning conservative thinking under the leadership of the Central Committee, give full play to the superiority of the cooperative system, fully mobilize the masses, and cadres take the lead in working hard, it is entirely possible to usher in a great leap forward in production next year and realize the revised draft of the National Program for Agricultural Development.

　　The meeting determined that next year's grain output should increase by 8.8% compared to this year; the output per unit area should increase from 341 jin this year to 361 jin; the production of live pigs should reach 6.8 million heads; and other major cash crops such as flue-cured tobacco, sugarcane, and cotton, as well as mountain forest products, animal husbandry, and sideline production, should also have high-speed growth, so that the total value of agricultural and sideline production in the province next year will increase by 13.5% compared to this year.

　　The meeting analyzed Yunnan's specific situation and believed that the main measures to increase agricultural production should focus on water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, deep plowing and careful cultivation, expanding multiple cropping, and increasing labor efficiency. Therefore, we should immediately launch a winter production upsurge centered on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, and ensure the completion of the plan to increase irrigation and improve 4 million mu of water conservancy construction next year. In the spirit of changing customs and habits, we must ensure that people have toilets, pigs have pens, and cattle and horses have stables, so that fertilizer application will increase by 20% next year. The meeting also believed that we should give full play to Yunnan's unique natural conditions, develop cash crops and mountain forest products, vigorously develop the border areas, and systematically migrate and reclaim wasteland, work hard, and help the people of all ethnic minorities develop their economies.

　　The meeting also made a rough plan for production development over the next ten years: it is estimated that by 1967, the cultivated land will reach 54 million mu, with a total output of 28 billion jin; cash crops and subtropical crops will develop to 16 million mu; and the number of pigs will develop to 20 million heads. In this way, in conjunction with the development of industry during the next two five-year plans, the historically economically backward face of Yunnan will be fundamentally changed.

　　The meeting believed that the guarantee for realizing the above-mentioned plan is the leadership of the Party and the strengthening of political and ideological work in the countryside. To this end, we must carry out the nationwide rectification movement to the end, and take the struggle between the two roads, the struggle to overcome bourgeois ideology and the backward ideology of small producers with proletarian ideology, as the fundamental content of the Party's political and ideological work in the countryside throughout the entire transition period. At the same time, we must greatly improve and strengthen rural propaganda work, and advocate that cadres go deep into production to become "experts." The meeting declared with infinite confidence that by working hard for ten years, we will definitely be able to build a new socialist countryside.

### 十年内根本改变云南落后面貌  省党代表大会充满无限信心批判右倾思想

　　十年内根本改变云南落后面貌
    省党代表大会充满无限信心批判右倾思想
    新华社昆明电　“苦干十年，建设好社会主义的新农村，”这是10日闭幕的中共云南省第一届代表大会第二次会议全体代表的共同决心。
    这次会议是和省的四级干部会议接连着举行的。从11月21日开始，会议学习了党的八届三中全会的文件，本着整风的精神采取大鸣大放大辩论的方式，对全省一年来以农业为主的各项工作进行了检查。会议期间，贴出了一千五百多张大字报，提出了九千八百多条意见，严肃地批判了党内右倾保守思想，在统一认识的基础上，确定了明年农业生产大跃进和今后十年农业生产发展的规划。
    会议认为，全省在第一个五年计划期间，粮食产量增加41％，今年虽然在气候、雨量极不正常的情况下，仍然增产约6％，成绩是显著的。但是右倾保守思想却是今年在农业生产战线上的突出倾向。水利基本建设较去年退缩，主要经济作物的种植面积和产量都没有完成计划；改变耕作制度，推广新式农具，改进耕作技术等项主要增产措施都不如去年进行得坚决有力。会议认为，这正是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争在农业生产战线上的反映。而某些同志在合作化高潮以后，阶级警惕性降低了，不善于经常地坚持以无产阶级思想克服资产阶级思想和小生产者的守旧思想，另外对合作化后农业生产力的发展速度估计不足，片面强调前进中的某些困难，甚至动摇屈服，这就不能不影响到今年农业生产总值的增长。会议指出，资产阶级和小生产者的习惯势力，正是这种右倾保守思想的社会根源，因此，坚持社会主义原则的坚定性，通过农村中的社会主义大辩论，以不断解决两条道路的斗争，并且正确地处理先进和落后的矛盾，克服小生产者的守旧思想，就成为巩固农业社和迅速发展农业生产力的根本保证。
    会议认为，在全省一万一千多个合作社中，经过已往三个月来的鸣放辩论，农村社会主义空气正在日益浓厚，凡是鸣放深透的地方，面貌都已焕然一新。目前，全省的合作社中，90％的社已基本巩固或比较巩固，干部也积累了领导生产的经验，加以云南省有着优越的自然条件，生产潜力很大，只要在中央的领导之下，批判富裕农民的资本主义倾向，克服右倾保守思想，充分发挥合作化制度的优越性，充分发动群众，干部带头苦干，掀起明年的生产大跃进和实现农业发展纲要修正草案是完全可能的。
    会议确定了明年的粮食产量应比今年增产8.8％；单位面积产量应由今年的三百四十一斤提高到三百六十一斤，毛猪生产应达到六百八十万头，其它烤烟、甘蔗、棉花等主要经济作物和山林特产、畜牧业、副业也都应有高速度的增长，使明年全省的农副业总产值比今年增长13.5％。
    会议分析了云南的具体情况，认为农业的主要增产措施，应以水利、积肥、深耕细作、扩大复种和提高劳动率为中心。因此目前应立即掀起以水利、积肥为中心的冬季生产高潮，保证完成在明年增灌和改善四百万亩水利建设的计划；以移风易俗的精神，做到人必有厕所，猪必有圈，牛马有厩，使明年施肥量增加20％。会议还认为，应该充分运用云南特有的自然条件，发展经济作物和山林特产，努力开发边疆，有计划地移民开荒，艰苦奋斗，帮助各少数民族人民发展经济。
    会议还对今后十年的生产发展作了轮廓的规划：预计到1967年耕地将达到五千四百万亩，总产量二百八十亿斤；经济作物和亚热带作物发展到一千六百万亩；猪发展到二千万头，这样，配合今后两个五年计划期间工业的发展，云南历史上经济落后的面貌将得到根本的改变。
    会议认为，实现上述计划的保证是党的领导和加强在农村中的政治思想工作。为此，必须将全民性的整风运动贯彻到底，把两条道路的斗争，把以无产阶级思想克服资产阶级思想和小生产者的落后思想的斗争，作为整个过渡时期党在农村政治思想工作的根本内容。同时要大大地改进和加强农村宣传工作，提倡干部深入生产成为“内行”。会议以无限的信心宣告，苦干十年，就一定可以建设好社会主义的新农村。
