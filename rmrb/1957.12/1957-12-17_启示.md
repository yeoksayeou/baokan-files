　　Enlightenment
    Here is the news that Wang Xinnian, the director of the Hebei Village Labor Agricultural Cooperative in Wutai County, Shanxi Province, told us: a mu of land on Mount Wutai can also yield 400 jin. This is a very ordinary piece of news, because similar news has been reported in other regions; but it is also an extraordinary miracle, because such a yield record has never appeared in this place before.
    In this bitterly cold mountainous area of "backing onto rocky mountains and facing the clear water river beach," which is frequently threatened by water and drought disasters, after the realization of cooperativization, people only promoted "two-izations" and "one-more," and this year the average yield per mu reached 401 and a half jin. And this, as Comrade Wang Xinnian said, is "just the beginning." What does this show? It shows that the potential for production in this mountainous area – the potential of people and the potential of nature – is still endless!
    In these extraordinary days, miracles are constantly appearing. How many things that were impossible in the past are now being done, and the dreams of the working people for thousands of years are gradually becoming a reality. At present, if people only think according to old rules, thinking that what has never happened in the past can never happen today, then they will certainly not be able to guide the movement forward, and may even become an obstacle to progress.
    Those comrades who are accustomed to looking backward may get some enlightenment from this ordinary news from Mount Wutai!

　　启示
    这里是山西五台县河北村劳动农业社主任王新年告诉我们的消息：五台山上也能亩产四百斤。这是一平平常常的消息，因为类似这样的消息别的地区也有过；但这又是一个不寻常的奇迹，因为这样的产量纪录在这个地方还从来没有出现过。
    在这个“背靠石头大山，面临清水河滩”经常遭受水旱灾害威胁的苦寒山区，在实现了合作化以后，人们只是在这里推行了“两化”、“一多”，今年平均亩产就达到了四百零一斤半。而这，正如王新年同志说的，这不过“仅仅是开始”。这说明什么呢？说明这里的山区，生产的潜力——人的潜力和自然的潜力，还是无穷无尽的呢！
    在这不平常的日子里，奇迹正在不断出现。有多少过去根本办不到的事，今天却办到了，劳动人民千百年的梦想，正在逐步变成现实。当前，人们的脑子如果只是按老规矩去思想，认为过去从来没有过的，今天便也不可能有。那他一定不能指导运动前进，甚至成为前进的障碍。
    那些惯于向后看的同志，从五台山这个平常的消息里，也许会得到一点启示！
