Remembering Brother Hong Shen
Tian Han

Editor's Note: The "Collected Works of Hong Shen" has recently been published in succession by the China Drama Publishing House. The complete works are divided into four volumes, totaling approximately 1.5 million words, including Comrade Hong Shen's important plays and essays. This is the preface written by Comrade Tian Han for the collected works.

On the afternoon of August 22, 1955, because I was about to travel to South China, I was rushing to write an article and finishing up some work at the office when I suddenly received a call from the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Liaison, saying that Mr. Hong Shen wanted to talk to me, Yang Hansheng, and Xia Yan. Knowing that Brother Shen's condition had worsened, I was very nervous. Because I couldn't find Brothers Yang and Xia at the moment, I went to Tieshi Zi Hutong and invited Comrade Ouyang Yuqian to rush to No. 10 Xiaoxiguan Hutong, Shijin Garden. Brother Shen was sleeping on a rattan bed in the living room, with Sister-in-law Hong at his side, and a female nurse was arranging to give him a painkilling injection.

Mr. Hong was very excited to see us. I asked about the reason for the invitation. He said that his illness might be terminal. His wife worked very diligently in the Beiying Film Printing Factory and was known as a "model worker," which put his mind at ease. What he was worried about was his daughters, Hong Gang and Hong Tong. They were both doing well in school, but they were still young and needed care in all aspects. He especially hoped that I would help them politically so that they could grow into strong revolutionary fighters. I agreed to this. I advised him not to be too nervous about his illness. Since the doctor had proved that it was not cancer (this was of course to comfort him), but a general lung disease, given his physique and today's medical conditions in Beijing, there was a solution. "Treating illness is also a fierce struggle, and we must not be defeated spiritually first," I said. I also jokingly mentioned that he had exaggerated his illness several times in the past, saying that the doctor had declared his stomach illness serious, that he could only live for two more years, and that he only had one year left, but later he lived for many more years, and his stomach illness was finally cured. I also talked about how in 1937, he led the Anti-Japanese War Drama Troupe No. 2 from Nanjing across the Yangtze River to the war zones around Xuzhou and Zhengzhou. At that time, the war situation was tense, and working in the war zone meant the possibility of danger at any time. Therefore, he held my hand tightly and said, "Shouchang, goodbye. This is the last time we will part. Take care of yourself." These tragic lines still lingered in my ears, but less than three months later we met again in Wuhan. Brother Shen smiled happily as he recalled the situation that day.

Mr. Hong was a person of rich emotions, but also a very rational and objective person. He also had a wealth of scientific knowledge and understood the seriousness of his illness. Pointing to the books on the shelf, he said to me, "Give some of these books to Yuqian, and some to you." I felt very sad when I heard this. Yuqian smiled and said, "Just talk nonsense."

The nurse was about to start the injection, and he urged us to leave, so we honestly came back. Later, I really regretted that I didn't take this opportunity to talk to him more about important artistic ideas, nor was I able to help him solve the organizational problems that he had been asking for for a long time. This was a great loss for us and for himself.

A day or two later, Mr. Hong's condition worsened, and he was moved from his home to the Soviet Red Cross Hospital. On the second day of his admission, I bought several pots of fresh flowers on Chongwenmen Avenue to see him. He was in good spirits that day and quickly walked out of the ward to personally call Sister-in-law Hong. I originally wanted to discuss some issues that day, but Mr. Hong talked about his brothers visiting him the day before, and he seemed a little emotional, so I didn't go on.

The next day, I hurriedly accompanied the Albanian cultural delegation on a plane to Guangzhou and did not see him again. It is said that he had asked An E about me: "When will Shouchang be back?" An E said, "Probably in half a month." He didn't say anything.

On the third day in Guangzhou, I was having dinner with the Albanian delegation in the restaurant downstairs at the Ai Qun Hotel when Comrade Ding Bo, the director of the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Culture, handed me an urgent telegram from Zhang Guangnian. Brother Shen had passed away! Only a day or two after leaving him, I could never see him again. I cried.

I told the Albanian friends about Brother Hong Shen's life and the loss of his death to all of us. Some of them also knew him and were as shocked and saddened as we were!

I had wanted to write an article or a poem to mourn Brother Hong Shen, but I had never been able to write it. I had led representatives from the theatrical community and accompanied Sister-in-law Hong to sweep his grave, but this was far from expressing my sorrow.

On August 29th last year, I gave a report to more than 1,500 literary and art workers at the Shanghai Grand Theater. When I told them that it was the first anniversary of Mr. Hong's death, the whole audience stood up to observe a moment of silence for Mr. Hong. Brother Hong Shen's early theatrical activities were mainly in Shanghai, and the people of Shanghai were particularly familiar and close to Mr. Hong. It is natural that they felt particularly lost and saddened by Mr. Hong's death.

The most politically charged of Brother Hong Shen's activities in Shanghai was the incident of making a scene at the Grand Theater for Lo Ke's "Unfraid of Death" ("Shanghai Express"). Lo Ke's film insulted the Chinese people from the standpoint of colonialists. Mr. Hong was very indignant after seeing this film. He came to me at No. 41 Rihui Lane, the South China Society, to discuss it, saying that he had arranged to speak at the cinema and asked the audience not to watch it. He estimated that this would inevitably cause interference from the foreign manager of the cinema and the patrol room. But he had already talked to the lawyer of the Star Film Company, and if he was arrested, he would ask him to appear in court to defend him. Mr. Hong only felt that it was weak to make trouble alone, and no one would report the news if something happened. I very much agreed with his plan of action and found several comrades from the society to go with Mr. Hong to help him, namely the musician Zhang Shu, the famous film actor Jin Yan, and the young reporter Liao Mosha (now the Minister of Education of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China).

    忆洪深兄
    田汉
    编者注：“洪深文集”最近由中国戏剧出版社陆续出版，全书共分四册，约一百五十万字，内收洪深同志重要剧作及论文。这是田汉同志为文集写的代序。
    1955年8月22日的午后，因为将要到华南旅行，我正在赶写一篇文章，并结束一下机关的工作，忽然接到对外文化联络局的电话，说洪深先生找我和阳翰笙、夏衍两同志去谈谈。知道深兄病况转坏，我心里很紧张，因一时找不到阳、夏两兄，我去铁狮子胡同邀了欧阳予倩同志赶到什锦花园小细管胡同十号，深兄正睡在客堂里的藤床上，洪师母也在侧，女护士正安排给他打止痛针。
    洪先生见我们来了很兴奋。我问起见邀的原因，他说他的病可能不起，他的夫人在北影洗印厂服务得很勤慎，有“模范工作者”之称，他很放心，所不放心的是他的女儿——洪钢、洪铜。她们在学校里成绩都很好，只是年纪还小，无论在那一方面都还需要照顾的，他特别希望我在政治上给她们以帮助，使她们成长为坚强的革命战士。这我答应了。我劝他对于他的病不要过于紧张。大夫既证明不是癌（这当然是安慰他的），而是一般的肺病，以他的体质，以今天北京的医疗条件，是完全有办法的。“治病也是一场激烈的斗争，我们精神上不要先被击败了。”我说。我还笑着提起他早年几次夸大他的病况，说医生宣告过他的胃病严重，只能再活两年，而他只剩一年好活了，但后来他又活了好些个两年，胃病也终于好了。又谈起1937年他领着救亡演剧二队由南京渡江到徐州、郑州一带战区工作，那时战局紧张，到战地工作，随时有发生危险的可能。因此，他曾紧紧握住我的手说：“寿昌，再见。这是我们最后一次分手了，愿你保重。”这种悲壮的台词还留在我的耳朵里，可是不到三个月我们又在武汉见面了。深兄想起当日的情况也愉快地笑了。
    洪先生是一个感情丰富的人，但也是一个挺理智、挺客观的人，他又有极丰富的科学常识，明白自己病体的严重情况，指着架子上的书对我说：“这些书有些送给予倩，有些送给你。”我听了十分黯然。予倩笑着说：“你姑妄言之吧。”
    护士要开始打针，他催我们走，我们就老实地回来了。后来我真是失悔，没有趁这个时候多跟他谈一些重要的艺术思想上的问题，也没有能帮助他解决他要求已久的组织问题，这对我们、对他自己都是很大的损失。
    隔了一两天，洪先生病体更重，就从他家里搬到苏联红十字医院去了。我在他入院的第二天，在崇文门大街买了几钵鲜花去看他。那天他精神还好，很快地便走出病房，亲给洪师母打电话。这一天我原想接触一些问题的，洪先生谈起前一天他兄弟来看他的事，似乎有些激动，我就没讲下去了。
    第三天我匆匆陪阿尔巴尼亚文化代表团乘飞机到广州去了，没有再去看他。据说他曾向安娥问起过我：“寿昌什么时候转来？”安娥说：“可能在半个月后。”他就不作声了。
    到广州的第三天，我陪阿尔巴尼亚代表团在爱群饭店楼下餐厅进餐，广州市文化局局长丁波同志交给我一封张光年同志发来的急电。深兄逝世了！才离开他一两天，我跟他真是永不能见面了，我哭了。
    我把洪深兄的生平和他的死给我们大家的损失告诉阿尔巴尼亚朋友们，他们有的也认识他，都跟我们一样的震悼！
    曾经想写文章、写诗哭洪深兄，但一直没有能写；曾经领戏剧界代表们，也曾陪洪师母去扫过他的墓，但这还远远不能表达我的哀感。
    去年8月29日我在上海大舞台向一千五百多位文艺工作者做报告，当我告诉他们那天正是洪先生逝世周年忌的时候，全场都起立为洪先生默哀。洪深兄早期的戏剧活动主要是在上海，上海人民对洪先生是特别熟悉的、亲密的。他们对洪先生的死感到分外的损失和悲痛是很自然的。
    洪深兄在上海的活动中政治性最强的一次应该是为罗克的“不怕死”（“上海快车”）而大闹大光明影戏院的事件了。罗克这部片子站在殖民主义者的立场侮辱中国人民，洪先生看了这部片子之后非常愤慨，他到日晖里四十一号南国社来找我商量，说他安排去影院讲话，要观众不要看。他估计：这样一定会引起影院外国经理和巡捕房的干涉。但他已经跟明星公司的律师谈过了，一旦被捕，请他出庭辩护。洪先生只是感到一个人去闹，势力单薄，出了事没人报信。我非常同意他的这一行动计划，找了几位社员同志跟洪先生去，顺便助他的威，那是音乐家张曙，电影名演员金焰和青年记者廖沫沙（今中共北京市委教育部长）三位。  （未完，待续）（附图片）
