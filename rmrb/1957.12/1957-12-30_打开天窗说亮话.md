    Speaking Frankly
    Question: Over the past two months, the development of the international situation seems to give the impression that since the publication of the two declarations of the Moscow Conference, although the Soviet Union has taken many major measures to stop the Cold War and realize peaceful coexistence, a small group of monopoly capitalists in power in the United States, in order to continue to obtain huge profits from the arms race, have not only not taken a step towards the road of peaceful coexistence, but have repeatedly attempted to incite a new round of arms expansion and war preparation. The ruling faction in the United States is indeed afraid of peaceful competition. In this light, isn't the Soviet Union's sincerity in striving for peace just a one-sided effort, and is it unlikely to be realized?
    Answer: The above view has its reasons. All monopoly capitalists will not consider the life and death of the people in order to make war fortunes. Once the international situation eases, they will not only have no profits, but also face an accelerating economic crisis. This is stated very bluntly in the "Gaither Committee" report in the United States: "Economists generally believe that the total national output should generally increase by about 1% to 2% per year over a long period of time. However, this is not happening now, and the Treasury is entering a period of declining revenues. Therefore, new funding (editor's note: referring to the huge military spending for expanding armaments) should restore the normal growth rate of the total output, thereby providing revenue for the Treasury." Here, we should also add a sentence, namely: "Thereby also filling the pockets of arms dealers." This is the social root cause of the war preparations that have been stirred up inside the United States at a time when the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union have taken powerful steps to realize peaceful coexistence. From this point of view, the group of monopoly capitalists represented by the ruling faction in the United States will not accept the policy of peaceful coexistence from the perspective of their class interests.
    However, we must also see the other side of the matter. That is, the fate of the world no longer depends on the will of imperialism and monopoly capitalists. Without going too far back, just looking at a few things that have happened recently is clear.
    The Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Group was originally intended by the United States, in collusion with Britain, to use the launch of the Soviet artificial satellite as an excuse to tighten the reins and drive the partners of the North Atlantic Group onto the road of a new arms race. However, contrary to expectations, as soon as the meeting opened, it had to change the agenda and discuss Bulganin's peace proposals and the issue of disarmament.
    Immediately following the Paris meeting, a headwind arose in the United States, blowing up a frenzy of war preparations. The secret report of the "Gaither Committee" revealed that the original instigators intended to use the excuse of the "Soviet threat" to scare the people at home into willingly tightening their belts and supporting a huge arms expansion plan. However, things did not develop as smoothly as they thought. In recent days, the trend of American public opinion has been increasingly strongly demanding negotiations with the Soviet Union. As the American "Newsweek" said in its December 30th issue: There is a pressure both inside and outside the United States to hold a summit meeting. The well-known American commentator Lippmann published an article in the "New York Herald Tribune" on the 25th, advocating that the US government negotiate with the Soviet Union. He said: "If the United States stubbornly pursues a policy of refusing to negotiate, its position in the world will suffer incalculable, and possibly irreparable, losses." And the "Gaither Committee" plan was denounced by the "New York Post" as a crazy plan. Voices from different strata strongly demanded the resignation of Dulles, who opposed East-West negotiations. The "New York Post" published an editorial entitled "Why Dulles Should Resign"; the American "United Mine Workers Journal" pointed out in an editorial: "We don't want to keep saying it, but Dulles should resign." Because people have seen the terrible disasters that a new war will bring, the policy of insisting on the Cold War and arms expansion has completely lost popular support. The tendency to advocate peaceful coexistence has developed among some members of the American bourgeoisie, and this tendency has also developed within the North Atlantic Group.
    Now, the Asian-African Solidarity Conference being held in Cairo represents the invincible will of two-thirds of the world's population. The representatives who spoke unanimously issued loud calls for peace, for the immediate prohibition of nuclear weapons, and against imperialism.
    What should be especially taken into account is the powerful strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union: the solid unity manifested through the Moscow meeting of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the socialist countries, and the fact that the Soviet Union far surpassed the United States in rocket weapons, as manifested by the Soviet Union's launch of two artificial satellites, all made it impossible for imperialism to do whatever it wanted. Even if imperialism is unwilling in every way, it cannot but seriously treat the Soviet Union's peace initiatives. The general trend and the will of the people, even if imperialism is unwilling to bow its head and admit defeat and lay down its butcher knife; even if monopoly capitalists do not give up the pursuit of high profits and continue to put up stubborn resistance, making things difficult, they will eventually be unable to resist the advance of the cause of peace.
    Therefore, speaking frankly: "Peace can only be strived for, and cannot be obtained by begging." Only the increasing strength of the socialist camp and the further development of the struggle of the people of the world for peace will force the imperialist group headed by the United States to accept negotiations, stop the Cold War, reduce armaments, and accept peaceful coexistence.

    打开天窗说亮话
    问　两个月以来，国际形势的发展，似乎给人这样一种印象：自从莫斯科会议两大宣言发表以后，纵有苏联为停止冷战、实现和平共处，采取了许多重大的措施。可是美国当权的一小群垄断资本家，为了继续从军备竞赛中获取巨额利润，不但没有向和平共处的道路上迈进一步，反而一再企图煽动新的扩军备战。美国的当权派确是害怕和平竞赛的。这样看来，苏联争取和平的一片真诚，也只是剃头担子一头热，岂不是难望实现？
    答　上面这种看法，有它一面的理由。所有的垄断资本家，为了发战争财，是不会考虑人民死活的。一旦国际局势缓和下来，他们不但会利润无着，并且还会面临加速到来的经济危机。这一点，在美国“盖瑟委员会”报告中说得很露骨：“经济学家们普遍认为，全国总产值在一段长时间内一般每年应增加1％到2％左右。可是现在没有发生这种情况，并且财政部正进入收入不断减少时期。因此，新的经费（编者按：指的就是扩充军备的巨额军费）应该使总产值恢复正常的增长率，从而为财政部提供收入”，这里还应该补上一句，就是：
  “从而也可以大饱军火商的私囊”。这就是当着以苏联为首的社会主义国家采取了实现和平共处的有力步骤的时候，美国内部却煽起了备战狂的社会根源。从这一方面来看，美国当权派代表的一群垄断资本家，从他们的阶级利益出发，是不会接受和平共处方针的。
    但是，我们还要看到事情的另一面。那就是世界的命运，已不再取决于帝国主义和垄断资本家的意志了。远的不去说它，只看最近发生的几件事就清楚了。
    北大西洋集团的巴黎会议，原来是美国勾结英国，满想借口苏联人造卫星上天的由头，勒紧缰绳，把北大西洋集团的伙伴们赶上新的军备竞赛的道路。可是，事与愿违，会议一开，却不得不改变议程，讨论了布尔加宁的和平建议，讨论了裁军问题。
    紧接着巴黎会议，美国国内出现了一股逆风，吹起备战狂想曲。“盖瑟委员会”秘密报告透露，始作俑者原来打算借口“苏联威胁”，吓住国内人民，情愿勒紧腰带，支持一个庞大的扩军计划。可是，事情的发展，也并不像所想的那样顺利。近几天来，美国舆论的倾向，却是越来越强烈地要求同苏联谈判，如12月30日一期的美国“新闻周刊”说：美国国内外都出现了一种举行最高级会谈的压力。美国著名评论员李普曼25日在“纽约先驱论坛报”上发表文章，主张美国政府同苏联谈判。他说：“如果美国固执地实行拒绝谈判的政策，它在世界上的地位将受到难以估计的、可能是无法挽救的损失。”而“盖瑟委员会”的计划，被“纽约邮报”斥为疯狂的计划。来自不同阶层的呼声，强烈地要求反对东西方谈判的杜勒斯下台。“纽约邮报”发表了“为什么杜勒斯应该下台”的社论；美国“联合煤矿工人报”在社论中指出：“我们不想老是这么说，但是杜勒斯该下台了。”由于人们看到了新的战争将会带来可怕的灾害，坚持冷战和扩军备战的政策，已经完全丧失人心。主张和平共处的倾向，已经发展到美国资产阶级一部分人士中去，这种倾向，也发展到北大西洋集团的内部。
    现在，正在开罗举行的亚非团结大会，代表了全世界三分之二的人口不可屈的意志。发言的代表们，一致发出要求和平，要求立即禁止核武器，反对帝国主义的响亮呼声。
    尤其要估计到的，就是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营力量强大：通过社会主义各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议所表现出来的牢固的团结，通过苏联发射两个人造卫星所表现出来的苏联在火箭武器方面远远地超过了美国的事实，都使得帝国主义再也不能为所欲为了。即使帝国主义虽然一万个不愿意，但是，却不能不认真对待苏联的和平创议。大势所趋，人心所向，纵然帝国主义不甘心低头认输，放下屠刀；垄断资本家不放弃追逐高额利润，继续作出顽抗，使好事多磨，但是，他们终将抵不住和平事业的前进。
    因此，打开天窗说亮话：“和平只能争取，不能哀求而得。”只有社会主义阵营力量的日益强大，全世界人民要求和平的斗争越加发展，才会迫使以美国为首的帝国主义集团接受谈判，停止冷战，裁减军备，接受和平共处。
