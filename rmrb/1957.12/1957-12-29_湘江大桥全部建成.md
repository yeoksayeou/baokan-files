Xinhua News Agency, Hengyang, 28th—The Hengyang Xiangjiang River Bridge has been fully completed. The bridge acceptance committee announced yesterday that the quality of the steel beam section and the highway bridge deck is rated as excellent, meeting national design standards, and can be officially handed over to the state for use. The Hengyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Guangzhou Railway Administration of the Ministry of Railways have decided to hold a traffic opening ceremony on the 29th.

This bridge is the second dual-purpose railway and highway bridge built in New China after the completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. After it opens to traffic, it will not only connect the Xiang-Gui Railway and the Jing-Guang Railway in southern China, but also link the southern Hunan highway network.

From surveying and design to steel beam manufacturing and construction, this bridge was undertaken by China's bridge builders themselves under the guidance of Soviet experts; all building materials were also manufactured by relevant factories in China. Most of the engineering and technical personnel and workers who participated in the bridge construction were new forces cultivated at the Yangtze River Bridge construction site. Many bridge-building experiences of the Yangtze River Bridge have blossomed and borne fruit here for the first time. For example, the adoption of advanced construction experience such as continuous beam and cantilever assembly methods has saved a large amount of steel and wood. The entire bridge cost less than five million yuan, saving more than 500,000 yuan compared to the original plan.

Construction of this bridge started in September 1955. It was suspended for eight months to support the Yangtze River Bridge. It only took one year and eight months to complete the construction. However, in the past, the Kuomintang hired so-called American experts to build a single railway bridge here, which took eight years. It was completely destroyed during the War of Resistance Against Japan not long after it was opened to traffic. (Attached picture)

### 湘江大桥全部建成

    湘江大桥全部建成
    新华社衡阳28日电　衡阳湘江大桥已经全部建成。大桥验收委员会昨天宣布，大桥钢梁部和公路桥面质量总评是优良，符合国家设计标准，可以交给国家正式使用。中共衡阳市委和铁道部广州铁路管理局决定在29日举行通车典礼。
    这座桥是继武汉长江大桥通车后新中国修建的第二座铁路公路两用双层大桥，通车后不仅把我国南部湘桂路和京广路连成一起，而且也把湘南公路网串连起来。
    这座桥从勘测设计、钢梁制造到施工，都是在苏联专家指导下由我国桥梁建设者自己担负的；全部建筑器材也都由我国有关工厂制造。参加建桥的工程技术人员和工人，大部分是长江大桥工地培养出来的新生力量。长江大桥的许多建桥经验，第一次在这里开花结了果。例如，采用连续梁和悬臂式拼装法等先进施工经验，就节省了大量的钢材和木材。整个桥的造价不到五百万元，比原计划节约五十多万元。
    这座桥是1955年9月开工的，中间因为支援长江大桥曾经停工八个月，实际只有一年零八个月就修成了。可是过去国民党请了所谓美国专家在这里单修一道铁路桥，却花了八年时间；它通车不久，便在抗日战争期间全部炸毁了。（附图片）
