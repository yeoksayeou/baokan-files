Today, veteran footballers will appear at Xian Nong Tan
(Our newspaper reports) The final match of the National Football League Division A in the Beijing-Tianjin region – Tianjin team versus the "August 1st" team – is scheduled to take place at 2:30 PM today at Beijing's Xian Nong Tan Stadium. Before this competition, there will be a veteran football team match between the Jinghua team and the Drama and Film United Team.

The Jinghua team's players average 38 years of age, and the Drama and Film United Team is not much younger, averaging over 30 as well.

The Drama and Film United Team is composed of actors from the China Peking Opera Theatre, Beijing Peking Opera Troupe, Central Experimental Opera House, Beijing Film Studio's Film Actors Troupe, and other units. Among them are Peking Opera actors Qiu Shengrong and Li Zongyi, who are very familiar to Beijing audiences, Liu Liu, an actor from the film "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," and Chen Hua and Mi Rong, who played the Howling Celestial Dog in the dance "The Lotus Lantern." The oldest players on the team are center forward Qiu Shengrong and defenders Li Zongyi and Chang Rongzeng, all of whom are over forty. The youngest players are forward Mi Rong and goalkeeper Wang Chunxi, who are both twenty-five or twenty-six years old. Most of them are members of the Ministry of Culture's football representative team, and six of them have been awarded the title of National Third-Level Athlete. Li Zongyi, Mi Rong, Li Jian (forward), Liang Hao (defender), and others were members of the Beijing Municipal Football Representative Team in 1952.

The Drama and Film United Team was recently established and will play a leading role in promoting mass sports activities in the drama and film circles.

    今日先农坛上足球老将出马
    本报讯　全国足球甲级队联赛京津区最后一场比赛——天津队对“八一”队，定今日下午二时半在北京先农坛体育场举行。在这场竞赛前，还有一场老将足球队比赛，由京华队对剧影联队。
    京华队队员平均年龄三十八岁，剧影联队也不小，平均也在三十以上。
    剧影联队是由中国京剧院、北京京剧团、中央实验歌剧院、北京电影制片厂电影演员剧团等单位的演员组成的，其中有北京市观众最为熟悉的京剧演员裘盛戎和李宗义，有影片“智取华山”的演员刘柳，也有在舞蹈“宝莲灯”中扮演哮天犬的陈华和米戎，这个队年岁最大的队员是中锋裘盛戎、后卫李宗义和常荣增，他们都已经四十开外了，年纪最小的前锋米戎，守门员王春喜也都已经二十五、六了。他们大部分是文化部足球代表队的队员，而且有六个人获得了国家三级运动员称号，李宗义、米戎、黎鉴（前锋）梁灏（后卫）等在1952年还是北京市足球代表队队员。
    剧影联队是不久前刚成立的，它将在戏剧和电影界开展群众性体育运动中起带头作用。
