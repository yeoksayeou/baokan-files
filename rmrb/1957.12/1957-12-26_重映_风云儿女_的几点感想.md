    Some Thoughts on the Re-release of "Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm"
    Xu Xingzhi

    In 1931, the "September 18th Incident" launched by Japanese militarists shocked the awakening of the Chinese nation, and a surging wave of anti-Japanese movements swept across the land of China, igniting a fierce revolutionary flame of national salvation.

    The film "Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm" is a progressive film that reflects how passionate young people at that time were moved by patriotic sentiments, abandoned abnormal romantic relationships, and went to the front lines of the anti-Japanese national salvation movement.

    As the film's theme song – "The March of the Volunteers" – reveals, the film's theme is a call to all Chinese people "who do not want to be slaves" to rise up! "Build a new Great Wall with their flesh and blood!" to resist the enemy's invasion and defend the survival of the motherland. At that time, as depicted in the film, thousands upon thousands of passionate young people abandoned their families, left their wives and children, and went to the forefront of the anti-Japanese national salvation movement.

    At that time, the Chinese Communist Party called on the whole nation to unite and carry out the just struggle for anti-Japanese national salvation, while the Kuomintang reactionaries implemented a policy of anti-communism, surrender, and compromise, and stood against the people. Due to the disastrous defeat of the five encirclement campaigns against the red areas, the reactionaries further strengthened the white terror in the white areas. Following the brutal murder of five cultural martyrs, including Hu Yepin, Tian Han and Hua Han (Yang Hansheng) were arrested and imprisoned. Because the bloodstains of the predecessors were not yet dry, everyone was worried about the safety of these two comrades. Thus, a widespread rescue movement was launched in Shanghai's cultural circles, including performances and productions of the two comrades' plays and films.

    At that time, many of our comrades had already infiltrated film companies. In fact, China's progressive film industry was directly or indirectly carrying out activities under the leadership of the Party; especially the new "Diantong Film Company," which was directly under the leadership of the Party for film production. The film script "Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm," written by Comrade Tian Han before his imprisonment, was divided into scenes by Comrade Xia Yan. Then, the task of directing was assigned to me, and the task of composing music was assigned to Comrade Nie Er. We undertook this dual task of external resistance and internal struggle under the direct leadership and supervision of the Party.

    However, the film was produced in an extremely harsh political environment: domestic reactionaries, in order to extinguish the revolutionary flames in the film and drama circles, sent fifty or sixty secret agents to Shanghai to sabotage the progressive film and drama cause, track and persecute the responsible comrades in the film and drama circles, and do everything possible to obstruct and attack the newly established Diantong Film Company. In order to find out our connection with Comrade Xia Yan, the reactionaries did not hesitate to send two secret agents to Diantong Company: a senior secret agent acted as a secretary, and another low-level secret agent carried a pistol every day, conducting despicable stalking, reconnaissance, and intimidation of our work and actions. However, this did not destroy the Party's film cause. We continued to persist in the struggle until Diantong Company was forced to dissolve.

    In addition to the political environment, the production conditions at that time were also very rudimentary. Because it was still a transition period from "silent" to "sound," the domestic "Sanyou-style recorder" used for "Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm" was still in its initial stage. Moreover, I was originally a painter, completely ignorant of film directing. The photographer, Comrade Wu Yinxian, was an amateur photographer and a novice who was handling a movie camera for the first time. Therefore, we did not achieve the due results in the expressive forms of film art, in the structure of film montage, and in the techniques of film directing.

    From the perspective of the script, the plot and characters of "Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm" are relatively thin. The poet Xin Baihua (played by Yuan Muzhi) and the girl A Feng (played by Wang Renmei), due to the superb and mature performances of the two artists, the characters' personalities still appear simple and natural. However, the role of Mrs. Shi (played by Tan Ying), due to the actor's stiff performance and poor makeup, enhanced the mediocrity of the character's personality. In the director's handling, he also failed to enrich them.

    In short, from today's requirements for the people's film cause, the film "Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm" played a certain role in the propaganda and mobilization for the anti-Japanese national salvation, but there are serious shortcomings in the quality of film art. As the director of this film, even though twenty-two years have passed, I still bear a heavy burden on my shoulders. However, on the other hand, I am infinitely delighted to see that its theme song, "The March of the Volunteers," broke through the limitations of the film and gained widespread popularity. During the Anti-Japanese War, it not only became a household name of national salvation song, but also became a bugle call to promote, encourage and organize the Chinese people to rise up and resist Japan. Even many revolutionary martyrs, before being brutally murdered by the enemy, often sang "The March of the Volunteers" and calmly went to their death. From this, we can know its great power.

    After liberation, "The March of the Volunteers" became the provisional national anthem of the People's Republic of China. Although the past days of suffering are gone forever, its ideal of inspiring the Chinese people to unite and build a socialist motherland has not become obsolete. Nie Er, this outstanding son of the Chinese people, the great singer, will live forever with the People's Republic of China, and his name and his songs will be immortal.

    重映“风云儿女”的几点感想
    许幸之
    1931年，日本军国主义者所发动的“九一八”事变的炮声，震惊了中华民族的觉醒，于是在全中国的国土上，卷起了风起云涌的抗日运动的浪潮，燃烧起轰轰烈烈的革命救亡的烽火。
    “风云儿女”这部电影，就是反映当时的热血青年，为爱国主义的思想感情所激动，抛弃不正常的恋爱关系，走向抗日救亡前线去的一部进步影片。
    正如影片的主题歌——“义勇军进行曲”所揭示的那样：影片的主题思想是号召全中国“不愿意做奴隶的人们”，起来！“把自己的血肉筑成新的长城”！抵抗敌人的侵略，保卫祖国的生存。当时，就像影片所描写的，千千万万的热血青年抛弃家庭，离妻别子，走向抗日救亡的最前线。
    当时，中国共产党号召全民团结起来，进行抗日救亡的正义斗争，而国民党反动派却执行着反共投降的妥协政策，与人民为敌。反动派由于对红色区域五次围剿的惨败，更加强了对白色区域的白色恐怖。随着文化界的五位烈士胡也频等被残杀之后，田汉和华汉（阳翰笙）两同志被捕入狱。由于前人的血迹未干，人人都在担心他们两个同志的生命安全，于是在上海文化界发起了一次广泛的营救运动，包括对两位同志的剧作和电影的演出与制作在内。
    当时，我们许多同志已经渗透到电影公司去，实际上中国的进步电影事业，已直接或间接地在党的领导之下进行活动；尤其是新型的“电通影片公司”，更是直接在党的领导下进行拍片的。田汉同志在入狱以前写好的“风云儿女”电影剧本，由夏衍同志进行分幕之后，便把导演的任务分配给我，而把作曲任务分配给聂耳同志。我们便在党的直接领导和监督之下，担负了这个对外抗战、对内斗争的双重任务。
    然而，影片是在极端恶劣的政治环境下进行摄制的：国内反动派为了扑灭电影、戏剧界的革命火焰，曾经派了五、六十个特务来到上海，对进步的电影、戏剧事业进行破坏。对电影、戏剧界的负责同志进行追踪和迫害。而对新生的电通影片公司，则极尽阻挠和打击之能事。反动派为了探寻我们和夏衍同志的联系，不惜派了两个特务到电通公司来：一个高级特务充当秘书，另一个低级特务则每天身上挂着手枪，对我们的工作和行动进行卑鄙的跟梢、侦察和恐吓。然而，这并没有能摧毁党的电影事业，我们仍继续坚持斗争，一直到电通公司被迫解散为止。
    除了政治环境之外，当时的制作条件也是十分简陋的。因为当时还是从“无声”到“有声”的过渡时期，“风云儿女”所使用的国产“三友式录音机”还在草创阶段。再加上我是一个学画的出身，对于电影导演完全是个门外汉。摄影师吴印咸同志是一个业余摄影家，还是第一次掌握电影摄影机的生手。因此，在电影艺术的表现形式上，在电影蒙太奇的结构上，以及在电影导演的手法上，都没有取得应有的成绩。
    从剧本的角度来看，“风云儿女”的故事情节和人物形象都比较单薄，诗人辛白华（袁牧之饰）和少女阿凤（王人美饰），由于两位艺术家的精湛而圆熟的表演，人物性格还显得朴素而自然，可是施夫人（谈瑛饰）一角，由于演员的表演生硬和化妆的恶劣，却增强了人物性格的平庸。而在导演的处理上，也没有能把它们丰富起来。
    总之，从今天对于人民电影事业的要求看来，“风云儿女”这部影片，在对抗日救亡的宣传鼓动的意义上是起了一定的作用的，但在电影艺术的质量上却存在着严重的缺点。作为这部影片的导演，虽事隔二十二年，我肩上依旧担负着沉重的负担。然而，我另一方面却又看到它的主题歌“义勇军进行曲”突破了电影的局限，获得广泛的流行而感到无限欢欣。在抗日战争时期，它不仅成为家喻户晓的救亡歌曲，而且成为宣传、鼓舞和组织中国人民起而抗战的号角了。甚至有好多革命志士，在遭遇敌人残杀之前，往往高唱着“义勇军进行曲”而从容就义，从这里我们就可以知道它的巨大的力量了。
    解放以后，“义勇军进行曲”又成为中华人民共和国的代国歌，虽然已往的苦难的日子一去不复返了，但作为鼓舞中国人民万众一心，建设社会主义祖国的理想并未过时。聂耳，这个中国人民优秀的儿子，伟大的歌手，将和中华人民共和国一起永生，他的名字将和他的歌曲永垂不朽。
