Moscow Dispatch from our newspaper, December 1st. The recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Youth League decided to improve the work of the Young Pioneers. The Soviet Young Pioneer organization has existed for thirty-five years, and has conducted extensive communist ideological education among the broad masses of Soviet children. It has achieved great success in helping children develop their intellectual and physical abilities in many ways, and in attracting children to actively participate in social public welfare undertakings and social construction.

In order to further strengthen the work of the Young Pioneers and cultivate Soviet children to become active builders of communism, the Central Committee of the League has decided that it is necessary to overcome the phenomenon that some Young Pioneer organizations in the past did not care about major domestic and international political events, and to overcome the phenomenon of treating the work of the Young Pioneers as indistinguishable from school teaching work, so that the work of the team is limited to activities within the school circle, and is divorced from social and political life. In the future, on the basis of continuing to carry out communist ideological education of patriotism and internationalism, the methods and methods of the Young Pioneers will be further improved to make it more closely connected with social life. Young Pioneer organizations at all levels in the Soviet Union must first establish regular contact with labor production units, so that Young Pioneers can carry out labor production internships in factories, state farms, and collective farms, and often organize meetings with advanced producers.

The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League also made specific provisions for further strengthening children's sports, recreational and other activities.

    苏联共青团中央决定
　　加强对少先队员劳动生产教育
    本报莫斯科1日电　最近举行的苏联共产主义青年团中央全会，决定改进少年先锋队工作。苏联少先队成立至今已经三十五年，少先队在广大苏联儿童中进行了广泛的共产主义思想教育。它在多方面帮助儿童发展智力、体力，吸引儿童积极参加社会公共福利事业和社会建设方面取得了巨大成就。
    为了进一步加强少先队工作，为培养苏联儿童成为共产主义积极建设者，团中央决定今后必须克服从前部分少先队不关心国内外重大政治事件的现象，克服把少先队的工作与学校教学工作无区别地看待，使队的工作仅仅限于学校圈子内活动，脱离了社会政治生活的现象。今后，将在继续进行爱国主义和国际主义的共产主义思想教育基础上，进一步改进少先队的工作方式方法，使它更紧密地联系社会生活。全苏各级少先队组织首先要使基层少先队组织同劳动生产单位建立经常联系，使少先队员能够在工厂、国营农场、集体农庄进行劳动生产实习，经常组织与先进生产者会见。
    共青团中央全会同时还作出了进一步加强儿童体育、文娱等方面活动的具体规定。
