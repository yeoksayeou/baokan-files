    This Method Has Been Changed
    When we saw the criticism "Can This Method Be Changed?" published on page 8 of the People's Daily on November 27th, our bureau was holding a business meeting. We conducted an investigation at the meeting regarding the facts listed in the article (the stationmaster of Shaodong County Bus Station also attended the meeting). We believe that the mechanical practice of making a family of three travel on three separate buses shows a serious lack of a mass perspective. This illustrates that the cadres at Shaodong Station lacked a deep understanding of the spirit of the regulations (the regulations do not stipulate that only one ticket can be purchased per person), and our bureau's ideological education work for employees was also insufficient. During this rectification campaign, we have made some changes to the ticket sales method in light of the special circumstances of intermediate stations. We now stipulate that each person can purchase three to five tickets at a time. If a family or companions need to travel on different buses due to different departure times, the station has the obligation to explain to the passengers on the same bus and make adjustments, to minimize the occurrence of separated travel.

### 这办法改了

    这办法改了
    当我们看到11月27日人民日报第八版登的“这办法能不能改？”的批评的时候，恰值我局在开业务例会，我们就文内所列事实在会议上进行了检查（邵东县汽车站站长也参加了会议）。我们认为，把一家三人分作三次车走的机械行事的作法，是严重地缺乏群众观点。这说明了邵东站的干部对制度（制度上并没有只准一个人买一张票的规定）的精神缺乏钻研，我局对职工的思想教育工作也做得不够。在这次整风运动中，我们针对中途站的特殊情况，将售票办法作了一些改变，规定每人一次可购买三到五张。如遇一家人或同伴因车次不同而有分次乘车的情况，车站有义务向同车旅客解释，进行调整，尽量减少发生分开乘车的情况。
