    Reported by our newspaper: The Second Science Symposium held at Tsinghua University, which opened on November 23rd, is currently deeply engaged in a large-scale debate on the two paths in scientific research.

    At the first plenary session of this Science Symposium, Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Higher Education, encouraged everyone to launch a struggle between the two lines in scientific research and to resolutely advance along the socialist road. Vice-President Liu Xianzhou made a report. He reviewed the new progress in scientific research at the school since the First Science Symposium last year and refuted the fallacy of "things are worse now than before" spread by the rightist Qian Weichang with the actual situation of scientific research conducted over the past year. He emphatically analyzed that the most fundamental problem existing in the work over the past year was the question of two paths, namely the struggle between the socialist line and the capitalist line. He criticized the purpose, planning, organization, and discipline of scientific research work, the connection between theory and practice, the relationship between teaching work and scientific research, cadre policy, and running science diligently and thriftily in six aspects, combined with the shortcomings and errors in the school's work. Liu Xianzhou proposed that in the future, the Party's leadership should be strengthened, the socialist ideology in scientific research work should be established through the展开 of a large-scale debate on the two paths, the study of advanced Soviet experience should be strengthened, administrative leadership and organizational work should be improved, and the material conditions of scientific research work should be improved to further carry out scientific research work.

    In recent days, all teachers at Tsinghua University have held four or five discussions on Liu Xianzhou's report, and gave speeches at the general meeting on December 7th. In the discussion, everyone began to extensively and deeply examine and criticize the problems existing in the past scientific research work, especially the bourgeois individualist thought and the direction of theory detached from practice. Teachers from the Radio Department exposed the capitalist line in scientific research advocated by the rightist Qian Weichang, who repeatedly advocated the idea of purely "catering to individuals" regardless of the needs of national construction, advocated finding research topics from the literature of capitalist countries, and used personal fame and gain to lure teachers to advance towards this kind of "science." These ideas found a market among some teachers and had a serious corrosive effect. Teachers of the Hydraulic Engineering Department are criticizing the bourgeois ideas spread by the rightist Huang Wanli.

    At present, the discussions in various departments are gradually deepening, and a second general meeting for speeches will be held soon. Everyone believes that the struggle between the two lines in scientific research work is serious and must thoroughly criticize the bourgeois path of scientific research.

    At this Science Symposium, teachers also submitted 104 academic reports, read 92 papers in nine groups, and more than 1,000 people from more than 200 fraternal schools, industrial departments, and research institutions participated in the academic discussions of each group.

    在清华大学举行的第二次科学讨论会上
    展开科学研究两条道路的辩论
    本报讯　清华大学举行的第二次科学讨论会在11月23日开幕以来，目前正在深入展开科学研究工作中两条道路的大辩论。
    在这次科学讨论会的第一次全体会议上，高等教育部部长杨秀峰勉励大家展开科学研究工作上两条路线的斗争，并坚决沿着社会主义道路前进。副校长刘仙洲作了报告。他回顾了学校自去年第一次科学讨论会以来科学研究工作新的进展，用一年多来科学研究开展的实际情况驳斥了右派分子钱伟长所散布的“今不如昔”的谬论。他着重分析了一年来工作中存在的最根本的问题是两条道路问题，即社会主义路线与资本主义路线的斗争。他就科学研究工作的目的性、计划性、组织性及纪律性，理论联系实际，教学工作和科学研究的关系，干部政策，勤俭办科学等六个方面，结合学校工作中的缺点和错误进行了批判。刘仙洲提出，今后应该加强党的领导，通过展开两条道路的大辩论，确立科学研究工作中的社会主义思想，加强学习苏联先进经验，改进行政领导和组织工作，以及改善科学研究工作的物质条件等，进一步开展科学研究工作。
    连日来，清华大学全体教师都对刘仙洲的报告进行了四五次讨论，并在12月7日进行大会发言。在讨论中，大家开始广泛和深入地检查批判了过去科学研究工作中存在的问题，特别是资产阶级个人主义思想和理论脱离实际的方向。无线电系教师揭露了右派分子钱伟长所宣扬的科学研究上的资本主义路线，他口口声声提倡不顾国家建设需要的单纯“就人”的主张，提倡从资本主义国家的文献中找研究题目，并且用个人名利引诱教师向这种“科学”进军。这些思想在有些教师中找到了市场，起了严重的腐蚀作用。水利系教师正在批判右派分子黄万里所散布的资产阶级思想。
    目前，各系的讨论正在逐步深入开展，最近还将进行第二次大会发言。大家认为，科学研究工作中两条路线的斗争是严重存在着的，必须彻底批判资产阶级的科学研究道路。
    在这次科学讨论会上，教师们还提出了一百零四篇学术报告，分九个组宣读了九十二篇论文，有二百多个兄弟学校、产业部门和研究机关的一千多人参加了各个分组的学术讨论会。
