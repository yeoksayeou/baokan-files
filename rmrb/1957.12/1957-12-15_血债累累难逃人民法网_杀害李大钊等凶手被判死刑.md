Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 14th: The counter-revolutionary criminal Wang Zhennan, who murdered revolutionary martyrs Li Dazhao, Hu Yepin, and others, was sentenced to death on the 13th by the Shanghai First Intermediate People's Court.

In 1927, while serving as a judge in the pseudo-Beijing Higher Court, Wang Zhennan actively participated in the plot to murder Li Dazhao, one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party, and others. As a representative of the Higher Court, Wang Zhennan served as a judge on a specially formed temporary court, conducting several "joint trials" of Li Dazhao and 29 others. He jointly decided to sentence Li Dazhao and 19 others to death, and Xie Guangpei and 9 others to prison terms, resulting in the heroic sacrifice of Li Dazhao and other martyrs on April 28 of the same year.

In 1931, while serving as the Chief Prosecutor of the Second Branch of the pseudo-Jiangsu Higher Court in Shanghai, Wang Zhennan prosecuted Hu Yepin (alias Jiang Wenhan), Rou Shi (i.e., Zhao Shaoxiong), Feng Keng (i.e., Feng Meiling), Li Weisen, Yin Fu (i.e., Bai Mang), and 13 others for "endangering the Republic of China." He handed over revolutionary young writers such as Hu Yepin, Rou Shi, Feng Keng, Li Weisen, and Yin Fu to the pseudo-Songhu Garrison Command in Longhua for secret execution. In 1934, Wang Zhennan again prosecuted Communist underground workers Kuang Huian and three others, who were eventually sentenced to death. In 1933, Communist underground workers Ou Zhiguang, Zhang Yushan, Yuan Youfang, and two others were prosecuted and sentenced to death by the pseudo-court. Wang Zhennan also personally informed the pseudo-court by letter to execute Ou and the others within three days of receiving the document, and thus the five were murdered.

During the thirty-five years before liberation, Wang Zhennan consistently acted as an executioner, cruelly murdering revolutionary martyrs in the reactionary judiciary. According to verifiable records, he directly persecuted as many as 180 Communist Party members and non-Party revolutionary patriots, of whom 34 were killed.

This blood-soaked murderer concealed his criminal history after liberation and refused to confess. The People's Government legally arrested him in December 1955. After multiple interrogations and in the face of overwhelming evidence, Wang Zhennan was finally forced to admit his crimes. The Shanghai First Intermediate People's Court held a public trial on the 13th, attended by 650 people, and sentenced Wang Zhennan to death in accordance with the law.

    杀害李大钊等凶手被判死刑
    新华社上海14日电　杀害李大钊、胡也频等革命烈士的反革命罪犯王振南，13日已由上海市第一中级人民法院判处死刑。
    王振南1927年在北京任伪京师高等审判厅推事时，积极参与谋害中国共产党创始人之一李大钊等人。王振南以高等审判厅代表的身份担任临时组成的特别法庭的法官，几次对李大钊等三十人进行“会审”，并共同决定判处李大钊等二十人死刑，谢光沛等十人徒刑，致李大钊等先烈于同年4月28日壮烈牺牲。
    1931年，王振南在上海任伪江苏高等法院第二分院首席检察官时，对胡也频（化名蒋文翰）柔石（即赵少雄）、冯铿（即冯梅岭）、李伟森、殷夫（即白莽）等十八人以“危害民国罪”起诉，并将胡也频、柔石、冯铿、李伟森、殷夫等革命青年作家交给龙华伪淞沪警备司令部秘密杀害。1934年，王振南又对共产党地下工作人员邝惠安等四人进行起诉，最后邝等都被处死刑。1933年，共产党地下工作人员欧志光、张玉山、袁友芳等五人被起诉到伪法院判处死刑，王振南还亲自函告伪法院在文到3日内执行，欧等五人遂即被害。
    王振南在解放前的三十五年中，在反动的司法界一直充当虐杀革命烈士的刽子手。据有案可查的，直接受王振南迫害的共产党员和非党革命志士即达一百八十人之多，被杀害的有三十四人。
    这个血债累累的凶手，解放后仍隐瞒罪恶历史，拒不坦白。人民政府在1955年12月依法将他逮捕后，经过多次审讯，在大量的证据面前，王振南才不得不认罪，上海市第一中级人民法院13日举行了有六百五十人参加的公开审判，依法判处王振南死刑。
