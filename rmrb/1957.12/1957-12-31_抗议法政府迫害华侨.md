    Protest Against the French Government's Persecution of Overseas Chinese
    To the Editor:
    Having learned from the newspapers that the French government recently closed down the overseas Chinese publication "Qiaozhong" (Overseas Chinese Masses) newspaper, arrested our students studying in France without cause, illegally searched their residences, and finally unreasonably ordered the "Qiaozhong" newspaper editor Shen Yun to leave the country, we are very indignant at the French authorities' persecution of our French overseas Chinese and lodge a serious protest against the unreasonable behavior of the French authorities.
    "Qiaozhong" newspaper is a legal publication that was legally registered with the French Ministry of the Interior. After publication, it was sent to the French side for review on schedule. The content was purely to report on the construction of the motherland and news of overseas Chinese, and it never interfered in France's internal affairs. Now it has been brutally destroyed, which fully exposes the essence of the so-called democracy and freedom of the French government, and also seriously hinders the development of friendship between the people of the two countries.
    We all returned from studying in France and have a deep friendship with the overseas Chinese in France. We are very sympathetic to the oppression of the overseas Chinese and extremely indignant at the unreasonable actions of the French government.
    The legitimate rights and interests of our overseas Chinese are not allowed to be unreasonably violated, and the people of the motherland fully support their just struggle.

    抗议法政府迫害华侨
    编辑同志：
    从报纸上得悉法国政府最近封闭了华侨刊物“侨众”报，无故逮捕我国留学生，非法搜查他们的住宅，最后竟无理勒令“侨众”报编辑沈云三出境。我们对法国当局这种迫害我国旅法侨民的行为，甚为愤慨，并向法国当局的无理行为提出严重抗议。
    “侨众”报是依法曾向法国内政部申请登记的合法刊物，出版后皆按期寄送法方审查，内容纯系报道祖国建设情况和侨胞消息，从未干预法国的内政；今竟横遭摧残，这就充分地暴露了法国政府所谓民主自由的实质，也严重地妨害了两国人民间友谊的发展。
    我们都是从法国留学回来的，和旅法侨胞有深厚的友情，对这次侨胞们的横被压迫，十分同情；对法国政府的无理行动，极为愤慨。
    我侨胞正当的权益是不容许被人无理侵犯的，祖国的人民全力支持他们正义的斗争。
