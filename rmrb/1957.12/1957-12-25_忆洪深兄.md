    Remembering Brother Hong Shen
    Tian Han
    After the Xinhai Revolution, the situation was still chaotic. Brother Hong Shen, feeling the unrest of the country and changes in his family, was unable to sleep for quite some time alone overseas. Firstly, his spiritual pain had nowhere to be placed. Secondly, he felt that the people of the motherland, who were still in a state of semi-awakening, needed to be encouraged and enlightened through the most accessible art form, drama. Thus, he abandoned his dream of becoming a ceramics expert and became a student of Professor Baker, a drama expert.
    After returning to China, he worked at the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company and independently founded a theater troupe, staging "Zhao Yanwang," which was influenced by O'Neill but mainly exposed the evils of warlord infighting.
    It was at this time that I met Brother Hong Shen through the introduction of Comrade Ouyang Yuqian. He also joined the Drama Association of Ying Yunwei and others through Yuqian's introduction, directing Wilde's "Lady Windermere's Fan," laying the initial foundation for Chinese spoken drama in terms of acting and directing. After "Second Dream," Mr. Hong Shen withdrew from the Drama Association and joined the Nanguo Society, becoming our leading force. In our times of difficulty, he even gave us some material support with a plan. He gave our cause tremendous encouragement.
    Because Mr. Hong Shen taught at Fudan University for a long time, students influenced by him organized the Fudan Drama Society under his leadership. In this famous university drama society, he was not only a director and consultant but also an actor. He personally played Rostand's "Cyrano de Bergerac."
    Mr. Hong Shen was very serious about artistic creation, but he was also an actor with no airs at all. There is a saying in the old Chinese opera world: "Rescuing a performance is like putting out a fire." In the face of urgent need, he was a "firefighter" who disregarded everything. After the Nanguo Society returned from its public performance in Guangzhou, it lost some of its main actors. When it reorganized and performed at the Shanghai Ningbo Fellow Association, it was attacked by liberals. It was already two hours before the show, and the main actor of "Returning South" suddenly refused to come for some excuse. The show could not be performed, but tickets could not be refunded. When Mr. Hong Shen learned about this, he resolutely accepted the script and put on the costume. He was not familiar with many lines, but with the help of several prompters, and relying on his many years of stage experience, he managed to cope with this lyrical little play. When people praised his courage, he said, "Such an impromptu performance is not to be taken as an example. But an actor who does not announce the reason in advance and does not find a replacement is an act of harming the drama movement, which is even more not to be taken as an example. I am risking my artistic life to protest against this kind of behavior."
    Mr. Hong Shen lived an orderly and planned life. He was as serious and responsible about scholarship and teaching as he was about artistic work. After the Japanese imperialists surrendered, I lived in his home in Jiangwan, Fudan University, for some days. I usually got up not late every day, but Mr. Hong Shen usually got up at five o'clock every day. He liked to use a typewriter to make detailed notes when reading books, and he also used a typewriter for outlines of articles and speeches. You could hear the clattering sound from his study early in the morning and late at night.
    He loved the people, loved his friends, and loved his wife and children. But when the War of Resistance against Japan turned against us around the time of the Southern Anhui Incident, and the Kuomintang reactionaries began to attack the Communist Party and destroy progressive forces, Mr. Hong Shen was filled with grief and indignation. He took a large amount of sleeping pills in an attempt to commit suicide with his family. Fortunately, he was discovered early, and Mr. Hong Shen and his family were rescued. This incident aroused concern from people in various parts of Nanyang, who sent letters to comfort him. Because of our close relationship, some people mistakenly thought it was my incident.
    After liberation, he had been working so actively for the Party and the people. In December 1954, he led the Chinese cultural delegation to East Germany, Poland, and Hungary to sign cultural agreements. In Poland, doctors discovered that he had lung cancer and telegraphed our government. The Party allowed Mr. Hong Shen to return to China in February of the following year. When he returned to China, just before the convening of the National People's Congress, Mr. Hong Shen, leaning on his illness, also went to Wuxi and Changzhou to inspect the countryside. Later, his condition gradually worsened, cancer cells developed, severely pressing on the nerves, and the pain was unbearable for ordinary people. People who did not understand him worried about his suicide, but Mr. Hong Shen did not. He said to his wife, "I want to fight against the disease, and I also want to see the Yellow River clear. I also want to strive to join the Party." Indeed, he wrote a letter on his sickbed requesting to join the Party.
    Thirty years of brotherly exchanges with Brother Hong Shen cannot be summarized in a few thousand words. He was an enthusiastic cultural warrior in the national democratic revolution. He approached the Party and did many outstanding jobs under the Party's leadership. He also fell ill in the Party's cultural diplomacy work. The Party had also persuaded him to return to his original profession from the troublesome foreign affairs work. Therefore, Mr. Hong Shen directed "Forty Years of Wishes" and "Fascist Bacteria" for the China Youth Art Theatre, and he also planned to pick up the pen to create again. If he had not been deprived of his life by an incurable disease, Mr. Hong Shen would not have disappointed us.
    Some outstanding cultural figures in the national democratic revolution reveal their bourgeois faces and cannot pass the test in the socialist revolution stage, but the level of consciousness that Brother Hong Shen has already reached fully guarantees that he can become a socialist warrior, because he has consistently supported the Party, respected and demanded the Party's leadership; he has consistently supported socialism, he would rather die, rather commit suicide with his family in the old society, but in the new socialist society, he stubbornly wanted to live and fought against the disease until his death!
    I should carefully analyze Mr. Hong Shen's works, understand the era he was in and the spirit he represented from his art, and absorb its experience and inspiration. Some people may say, "We still lack the key." But understanding Mr. Hong Shen's character is the best key to understanding Mr. Hong Shen's works.

    忆洪深兄
    田汉
    辛亥革命后，时局仍然很混乱，洪深兄有感于国事的蜩螗和家庭的变故，他只身在海外曾经好一些时候不能睡觉。一来他的精神痛苦无法寄托，二来感到还在半觉醒状态的祖国人民需要通过最容易接近的戏剧艺术加以振作启发，这样他就舍弃陶磁专家的梦想，做了名戏剧家倍克教授的学生。
    回国之后，他一面在南洋兄弟烟草公司任职，一面独立成立剧社，演出受奥尼尔的影响、但主要暴露军阀混战恶果的“赵阎王”。
    我跟洪深兄正是在这时候通过欧阳予倩同志的介绍认识的。他也同样以予倩的介绍参加应云卫兄等的戏剧协社，导演王尔德的“少奶奶的扇子”，奠定了中国话剧表导演艺术方面初步的规模，“第二梦”以后，洪先生退出戏剧协社参加了南国社，成为我们的领导力量，在我们困难的时候他甚至还曾经有计划地给了我们一些物质支持。是他给了我们的事业以极大的鼓励。
    由于洪深先生长期在复旦大学任教，受他的影响的学生在他的领导下组织了复旦剧社。在这个著名的学校剧社里，他也不只是导演、顾问，而且是演员，他曾亲自演过洛斯丹的“西哈诺”。
    洪先生对艺术创造是十分严肃的，但他同时又是一个最没有架子的演员，中国老戏界有一句话叫“救场如救火”，在急迫的需要前面他正是一位披发缨冠，不顾一切的“救火员”。南国社从广州公演回来，失去了它一些主要演员，当它重整阵容在上海宁波同乡会演出时，又遭受了自由主义者的进攻。已经是开戏的前两个小时了，“南归”的主要演员忽然以某些口实不来了，戏无法演出，但又不能退票。洪先生知道了，竟毅然接受了这个剧本，扮上了。许多台词他不熟，在几位提词者的帮助下，靠着他多年的舞台经验，居然把这个抒情的小戏对付下来了。当人们称羡他的勇气的时候，他说：“这样的急就章是不足为训的。但演员事前不宣布理由，擅自不到，也不找代理人，是对戏剧运动的谋害行为，更不足为训，我这样拼着我的艺术生命上去，只是表示对这种行为的抗议。”
    洪先生平日生活得有条理、有计划。对做学问，对教学工作如同他对艺术工作一样十分认真负责。在日本帝国主义者投降后，我在江湾复旦大学的他的家里住过一些日子。我每天起床不算晚，但洪先生每天通常是五点钟就起来了。他看书爱用打字机做细致的记录，做文章和讲演的提纲也常用打字机，每天黑早和深夜都可以听得到从他书斋透出的哒哒哒的声音。
    他爱人民，爱朋友，也爱妻子、儿女。但当皖南事变前后抗战形势逆转，国民党反动派开始向共产党进攻，摧残进步力量的时候，洪先生无限悲愤，曾服用大量安眠药，企图举家自杀。幸而发觉得早，洪先生和他的家人被救转来了。这次事件曾引起南洋各地人士的关心，纷纷来信慰问他。由于我们的亲密关系，当时还有人误传是我的事。
    在解放后，他一直为党为人民工作得那样积极。1954年12月他率领中国文化代表团到民主德国、波兰、匈牙利去签订文化协定。在波兰的时候，医生发现他有肺癌，电告我国政府，次年2月党就让洪先生回国了。他回国的时候，正当人大召开之前，洪先生还扶着病到无锡、常州一带视察农村。后来他的病情逐渐严重，癌细胞发展，严重压迫到神经，痛苦非常人所堪，不了解他的人忧虑他自杀，但洪先生不，他对他的夫人说，“我要向病魔斗争，还要看到黄河水清，我还要争取入党。”的确，他在病床上曾写过一封信请求入党。
    跟洪深兄三十年来兄弟般的交往不是几千字所能概括的。他是一位民族民主革命中热情的文化战士。他靠近党，在党的领导下做过许多出色的工作。他也是在党的文化外交工作中病倒的。党也曾劝他由烦剧的对外工作中回到他的本业。因此洪先生替青艺导演过“四十年的愿望”和“法西斯细菌”，他还计划再拿起创作的笔。要不是被不治之症夺去了他的生命，洪先生是不会使我们失望的。
    有一些在民族民主革命中出色的文化人一到社会主义革命阶段就暴露出他的资产阶级面目，过不了关，而洪深兄所已经达到的觉悟水平却完全保证他能够成为一个社会主义的战士，因为他始终一贯地拥护党，尊重和要求党的领导；他一贯拥护社会主义，他在旧社会宁愿死，宁愿举家自杀，而在社会主义新社会，他执拗地要活下去，至死与病魔奋斗！
    我应该细致分析一下洪先生的作品，从他的艺术了解他所处的时代和他所代表的精神，吸取它的经验和灵感。可能有人说：“我们还缺少钥匙”。但懂得洪先生的为人便是理解洪先生的作品的最好钥匙。
    请允许我就写到这里吧。
