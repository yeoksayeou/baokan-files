Speech by Ichikawa Fukuhei, Chairman of the All-Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions

    On behalf of the All-Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, and express my sincere gratitude to the leaders and delegates who invited our Japanese trade union representatives to attend this conference, as well as to all Chinese workers for their brotherly and profound friendship. Not only Japanese workers, but also workers in Asia, the Arab world, and around the globe, are concerned about your conference and wish it success.

    Brave Chinese workers! We Japanese workers sing the praises of your great achievements under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, becoming the core of the Chinese people, resolutely breaking the shackles of imperialism, and taking your destiny into your own hands. It inspires our struggle, and we must learn from its experience. Following the great October Socialist Revolution completed by the Soviet people forty years ago, your great achievements are of worldwide and historical significance, and no one can undermine them. It further enhances the prestige of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Your country has become a consolidated and powerful nation.

    The strengthening of the socialist camp and the recent rapid advances in science and technology are gradually turning the beautiful hopes of all mankind into reality. The successful launch of artificial satellites by the Soviet Union and the completion of the Yangtze River Bridge in China are examples. The consistent peace policy of China and the Soviet Union has undoubtedly deepened the understanding among the people of all countries. We in Japan also regard it as a backing, actively making the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs and the movement to demand the removal of US military bases a movement of the entire people.

    Other Japanese representatives have already spoken about the current issues of the Japanese working class, so I will omit them. However, I must talk about my impressions of the conference.

    To be honest, Chairman Lai Ruoyu's report deeply moved me. The report reviewed past work, boldly pointed out shortcomings in the work, and put forward the great future direction with confidence and clarity. What particularly moved me was this passage in the report: "The Chinese working class, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, and with the support of the working class of the world and all peace-loving people, will surely build our country into a great, prosperous, and powerful socialist country!" We hope that this matter will be realized and achieve brilliant achievements. There are no national boundaries between workers' friendships. Let us work together more and more closely in the future and move towards a common goal.

    I wish the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions success!

    Long live the consolidated unity of the workers of China and Japan!

    Achieve the international unity of workers all over the world!

    全日本产业别工会会议议长
    市川福平致词
    我谨代表全日本产业别工会会议，向中国工会第八次全国代表大会致以衷心的祝贺，向邀请我们日本工会代表来参加这次大会的负责人和各位代表以及全中国工人的兄弟般的温暖而深厚的友谊，致以衷心的感谢。不仅日本工人，而且亚洲、阿拉伯以及全世界工人，都很关心你们的大会，并且预祝大会成功。
    勇敢的中国工人们！我们日本工人为你们在中国共产党领导下，成为中国人民的核心，坚决打断了帝国主义的枷锁，把自己的命运掌握在自己手里的伟大业绩而歌颂。它鼓舞着我们的斗争，我们要学习它的经验。继四十年前苏联人民完成了的伟大的十月社会主义革命之后，你们的伟大业绩是具有世界性的，历史意义的，任何人也不能破坏它。它进一步提高了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威信。你们的国家已经成为巩固的强国。
    社会主义阵营的加强和在科学技术方面最近的长足进步，使全世界人类美好的希望逐步变成了现实。苏联发射人造卫星的成功和中国长江大桥的建成，就是例子。中、苏两国一贯的和平政策，毫无疑问，加深了各国人民的了解。我们日本也把它当作靠山，积极地使禁止原子弹、氢弹运动和要求撤掉美军基地运动等等成为全体人民的运动。
    关于日本工人阶级当前的各种问题，其他日本代表已经谈过，我就省略了。但是，我一定要谈谈关于大会的感想。
    赖若愚主席的报告，老实说，使我受到深深的感动。报告检查了过去的工作，大胆地指出了工作上的缺点，并且满怀信心地、极为明确地提出了今后的伟大方针。特别使我受到感动的是报告中的这一段：“中国工人阶级和全国人民一起，在中国共产党的领导下，在苏联和其他兄弟国家的无私援助下，在全世界工人阶级和一切爱好和平人民的支持下，一定能够把我国建设成为一个伟大的繁荣富强的社会主义国家！”我们希望此事实现，获得光辉的成就。工人之间的友谊是没有国境的。让我们今后日益紧密携手，向共同目标前进。
    祝中国工会第八次全国代表大会成功！
    中日两国工人巩固的团结万岁！
    实现全世界工人的国际统一！
