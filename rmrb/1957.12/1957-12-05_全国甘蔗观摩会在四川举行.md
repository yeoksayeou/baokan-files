To exchange and summarize experiences in dryland sugarcane cultivation, the Ministry of Agriculture held a sugarcane high-yield observation meeting in Sichuan in mid-November. Attending the meeting were representatives from eight major sugarcane-producing provinces and regions across the country, as well as over a hundred national model workers, advanced sugarcane growers, experts, and professors. The observation meeting will organize a tour group to visit five agricultural production cooperatives in Neijiang and Yibin prefectures, including "Guangrong," which have achieved large-scale high yields, as well as sugarcane experimental stations. Experienced old farmers from the agricultural cooperatives will conduct on-site demonstrations for the tour group. The observation meeting will adhere to the spirit of learning from each other's strengths to overcome weaknesses, exchange experiences, and formulate sugarcane yield-increasing technical measures suitable for the characteristics of various natural environments.
