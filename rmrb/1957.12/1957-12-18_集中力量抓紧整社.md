Concentrate Forces and Grasp Firmly the Rectification of Communes

"What issues should be emphasized during the comprehensive rectification campaign in rural areas?" The Shaanxi Daily published an editorial on December 14 entitled "Rural Rectification Should Concentrate Forces on Rectification and Improvement," urging leaders at all county levels to pay serious attention to grasping rectification and improvement.

Why should we focus on grasping rectification and improvement? The editorial analyzes that: First, through the previous period of the great debate on the two roads, the arrogance of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements has been shattered, the capitalist thoughts and activities of some well-to-do peasants have been curbed, and the broad masses of peasants and rural cadres have received a relatively profound socialist education, and their political awareness has generally improved a step further. Especially on issues such as grain and collectivization, they have distinguished between right and wrong on major issues, and their confidence and determination to take the socialist road have been further strengthened. This provides favorable conditions for focusing on rectification and improvement. Second, with the progress of the high tide of agricultural production, to make the high tide of production last, not only does practical work urgently require us to improve the management and administration of agricultural cooperatives and improve the leadership style of cadres, but also, as can be seen from the experience of rectification trials in various places, the opinions expressed by the peasant masses are mostly requests for us to improve our work and improve our ideological style. If we do not grasp rectification and improvement firmly, it will inevitably affect the continued voicing of opinions by the peasant masses and the subsequent distinguishing of right and wrong, and affect the production enthusiasm of the peasant masses. Third, after the full airing of views, concentrating the main forces on grasping rectification and improvement not only fully demonstrates our spirit of "correcting ourselves before correcting others," and sincerely accepting the opinions of the masses, but also can give full play to the collective spirit of the peasants and their sense of ownership in caring for agricultural cooperatives, which is more conducive to uniting the broad masses of peasants and preparing ideologically for the next stage of the great debate. Therefore, the current comprehensive rectification in rural areas, after the full airing of views, should adopt the spirit of "boldly rectifying, resolutely rectifying, and thoroughly rectifying," welcome the criticisms of the masses with a cordial and comradely attitude, accept all their correct opinions, and seize the opportunity to rely on the strength of the masses to vigorously rectify the work style and improve the work.

The editorial points out that many cadres in some areas still do not understand the above significance deeply or thoroughly. Some regard the comprehensive rectification in rural areas as the same as the previous rectification of cooperatives, thinking that it is enough to "solve a few specific problems" or "criticize a few troublemakers." Some are afraid of "trouble," afraid of offending people, and afraid of affecting production, and their determination for rectification and improvement is not great, their confidence is insufficient, and they lack sufficient ideological preparation. These all show that some cadres do not clearly understand the purpose of rural rectification and the current needs, and lack sufficient understanding of the necessity of the peasant masses helping us to rectify. The opinions expressed by the peasant masses are mainly to help us rectify the organization and rectify the work style, which are not only fundamentally different from the nature of the right-wing elements' rampant attacks on the Party, but also different from the clamoring of some well-to-do middle peasants. Therefore, there is no need and should not be to adopt a great debate approach first, concentrating the main forces to criticize the wrong opinions of the peasants after the peasant masses have fully aired their views; instead, we should first happily rely on the strength of the masses, accept correct opinions and suggestions, and vigorously improve our work style. Naturally, the peasant masses will inevitably express some wrong remarks during the full airing of views. If these wrong remarks are not clarified, they will hinder the rectification of cooperatives and production. Of course, debates should be conducted under the principle of benefiting the rectification of cooperatives and production to distinguish right from wrong. If they are only general wrong remarks, do not rush to criticize or debate them, but leave them for the next period to launch a debate.

### 集中力量抓紧整社

    集中力量抓紧整社
    “在农村全面整风过程中，应该着重抓什么问题呢？”陕西日报在12月14日以“农村整风应集中力量抓整改”为题发表社论，要求各县领导上要严正注意抓紧整改。
    为什么要着重抓紧整改呢？社论分析说：第一，通过前一时期的两条道路大辩论，地主、富农、反革命分子、坏分子的嚣张气焰被打垮了，一部分富裕农民的资本主义思想和活动被制止了，广大农民群众和农村干部受到了一次比较深刻的社会主义教育，政治觉悟普遍提高了一步，特别在粮食、合作化等问题上，分清了大是大非，走社会主义道路的信心和决心更加坚定了。这为着重整改提供了有利条件。第二，随着农业生产高潮的进展，要把生产高潮持久下去，不但实际工作迫切要求我们改进农业社的经营管理，改进干部领导作风，而且从各地整风试办经验看出，农民群众鸣放出的意见，绝大部分是要求我们改进工作，改进思想作风，如果不抓紧整改，势必要影响农民群众继续鸣放和以后的明辨是非，影响农民群众的生产积极性。第三，在大鸣大放之后，集中主要力量抓紧整改，不仅充分表现我们“先正己，后正人”，诚恳接受群众意见的大公无私精神，而且更能充分地发挥农民的集体主义精神和关心农业社的主人翁感，就更有利于团结广大农民群众，为后一阶段的大辩论作好思想准备。因而目前农村全面整风，在经过大鸣大放后，就应以“大胆地改，坚决地改，彻底地改”的精神，用亲切的同志的态度，欢迎群众的批评，接受他们一切正确的意见，并趁热打铁，依靠群众的力量，狠狠地整顿作风，改进工作。
    社论指出：不少地区的干部对上述意义还理解得不深不透。有的把农村全面整风和以往整社一样地看待，认为只要“解决几个具体问题”或“批判几个捣蛋人”就行了。有的怕“麻烦”，怕得罪人，怕影响生产，对整改的决心不大，信心不足，缺乏足够的思想准备。这些都说明一部分干部对农村整风的目的和当前的需要认识不清，对农民群众帮助我们整风的必要缺乏足够的认识。农民群众鸣放出的意见，主要是帮助我们整顿组织、整顿作风，不仅与右派分子向党猖狂进攻的性质有根本的不同，而且也不同于一部分富裕中农的叫嚣。因此，就不需要也不应该在农民群众大鸣大放之后，先采用大辩论方式，集中主要力量批评农民中的错误意见；而是应该先痛快地依靠群众力量，接受正确的意见与建议，狠狠地改进我们的工作作风。自然，农民群众在大鸣大放中，一定会放出一些错误的言论，如果不澄清这些错误言论，会妨碍整社和生产，那当然就要在有利于整社和生产的原则下，进行辩论，分清是非。如果只是一般的错误言论，就不要急于去批驳、辩论，留待后一个时期展开辩论。
