To effectively prevent the phenomenon of rushing to spend money at the end of the year, the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee recently approved and forwarded the "Report on Preventing Hasty Spending at the End of the Year" from the Sichuan Provincial Department of Finance, requiring all localities to take measures as soon as possible, and instructing the finance and supervision departments to organize forces to conduct key in-depth inspections.

The Department of Finance listed some examples in the report, indicating that there are signs of rushing to spend money at the end of the year. For example, the Yangjiaping Stadium in Chongqing City has been completed, and the Chongqing Municipal Sports Commission found that there was surplus funding, so it planned to use it to beautify the environment. Since the fourth quarter, collective purchasing power in Chengdu has increased significantly. Some industrial, health, and school units have purchased X-ray machines, microscopes, refrigerators, and steel wire beds in large quantities. Some have submitted huge order plans to electrical appliance and pharmaceutical companies. The pharmaceutical company alone sold 182 microscopes in October, exceeding the fourth quarter sales plan by 82%. Some units are also preparing to convert dormitories built with self-raised funds into projects completed with budgetary investments, in order to reduce year-end surpluses within the budget.

To this end, the Provincial Department of Finance put forward the following measures in the report: (1) Uncompleted capital construction projects this year should actively strive to complete the planned tasks on the premise of ensuring quality, resolutely preventing hasty construction and hasty spending, resulting in waste and losses; surplus funds from completed projects and other undertakings are not allowed to be used; projects originally listed in 1958 must not encroach on this year's surplus funds; if it is indeed necessary to start construction this year ahead of schedule, it should be arranged uniformly by the Provincial Planning Commission and treated as an investment appropriation for 1958. (2) All instruments, equipment, office supplies, and books required by all government departments and units next year, except for those already stipulated or approved, must not be purchased in advance this year or prepay orders. Instruments and equipment that have been included in this year's plan but have not yet been purchased should also be strictly reviewed, and those that can be bought or not bought should be stopped immediately in the spirit of thrift. (3) All capital construction funds or other expenditures that are not included in the budget must not be converted into expenditures within the budget. (4) Finance departments and enterprise and institutional departments at all levels must strictly control year-end appropriations, and appropriately reduce the fund balances of user units on the premise of not affecting the normal progress of business plans. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen the inspection of the fund use plans of various units, and correct problems in a timely manner to ensure the economical use of funds.

Currently, in the spirit of both rectification and work, the Provincial Department of Finance has organized inspection teams to go to the Provincial Department of Industry, the Department of Education, the Department of Health, and the Bureau of Culture to conduct key investigations.

    四川省人民委员会采取措施
    防止和纠正突击花钱的现象
    本报讯　为了切实防止年终赶花钱的现象，四川省人民委员会最近批转了四川省财政厅“关于防止年终赶花钱的报告”，要求各地及早采取措施，并责成财政、监察部门组织力量，重点深入进行检查。
    财政厅在报告中列举了一些事例，说明目前已有年终赶花钱的迹象露头。例如重庆市杨家坪运动场已完工，重庆市体育运动委员会发现资金有余，就准备用来美化环境。成都市第四季度以来，集体购买力已有很大的增长，部分工业、卫生单位和学校，大批购买X光机、显微镜、冰箱以及钢丝床等，有的向交电、医药公司提出庞大的要货计划，仅医药公司在10月份就售出显微镜一百八十二台，超出第四季度销售计划的82％。还有的单位准备把自筹资金建成的宿舍，转作预算投资完成的工程，以减少预算内年终结余。
    为此，省财政厅在报告中提出以下办法：（一）本年度基本建设未完工程，应在保证质量的前提下，积极努力完成计划任务，坚决防止突击赶工和突击花钱，造成浪费损失；已完工程和其它事业结余的资金，一律不准动用；原列在1958年的工程项目，不得挤占本年结余资金；确需在今年提前施工的，应经省计划委员会统一安排，作为1958年的投资拨款。（二）一切机关单位明年所需的器具设备、办公用品和书刊等，除已有规定或经过批准以外，一律不得在今年提前购置或预付订款。虽已列入今年计划，尚未购置的器具设备亦应严加审查，凡属可买可不买的，应本节约精神立即停止购置。（三）凡是列入预算以外的基本建设资金或其它支出，一律不得转作预算以内的支出。（四）各级财政机关和企业、事业主管部门，必须严格控制年终拨款，并在不影响事业计划正常进行的前提下，适当压缩用款单位的资金余额。同时，还必须加强对各单位用款计划的检查，发现问题，及时纠正，以保证资金的节约使用。
    目前，省财政厅本着整风、工作两不误的精神，已组织检查小组，分赴省工业厅、教育厅、卫生厅和文化局等四个单位重点进行了解。
