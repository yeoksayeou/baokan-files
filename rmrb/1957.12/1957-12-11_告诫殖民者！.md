A Warning to Colonialists!
    By a Commentator of this newspaper

    After the United Nations General Assembly rejected the proposal on the West Irian issue, the nationwide movement of the Indonesian people to recover West Irian is further rising. Under the leadership of the Indonesian government, the Indonesian people have decided to wage a struggle outside the United Nations to resolve the West Irian issue. In recent days, the people and patriotic forces across Indonesia have taken action. All Indonesian workers working in Dutch enterprises held a general strike; people in various parts of Indonesia launched a boycott movement against Dutch colonialists; and the Indonesian government has also taken over some Dutch enterprises that have been sucking the blood of the Indonesian people for many years. At the same time, Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio stated that if the Netherlands does not initiate the resumption of negotiations to discuss the status of West Irian, Indonesia will sever diplomatic relations with the Netherlands.

    These actions by the Indonesian people show that their determination to recover West Irian is unwavering. The Indonesian people can no longer tolerate the Dutch colonialists continuing to occupy their territory. West Irian must be returned to Indonesia. "Give me back my land!" This is the unanimous and sacred demand of the Indonesian people.

    However, to this day, the Dutch colonialists not only refuse to hold negotiations with Indonesia but continue to send warships to West Irian. The Dutch government has also held an "emergency meeting" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to discuss the situation in Indonesia, attempting to rely on the power of Western colonial countries to jointly interfere in and suppress the patriotic movement of the Indonesian people. At the same time, Western colonial countries such as the United States openly support the Dutch colonialists. A spokesman for the US State Department stated that the United States might "warn" Indonesia to "act carefully." US news agencies have used various distortions and propaganda to intimidate the Indonesian people, saying that if the Indonesian people resolutely oppose the Dutch colonialists, Indonesia's economy will "collapse."

    But the Western colonialists' calculations are wrong. Now is no longer the time when Asian people listen to the "warnings" of Western colonialists. It is the US and Dutch colonialists who need to be "warned." The Indonesian government was forced to take patriotic actions because the Dutch government refused to resume negotiations and the United Nations General Assembly failed to fulfill its duties, which is entirely reasonable. The Chinese people, together with the people of Asia and Africa, and the vast people of the world, sympathize with and support the just struggle of the Indonesian people. The cause of justice is bound to win, and it is not others who are collapsing, but precisely all colonial forces in Asia and Africa!

　　告诫殖民者！
    本报评论员
    在本届联合国大会否决了关于西伊里安问题的提案以后，印度尼西亚人民要求收复西伊里安的全国性运动正在进一步高涨中。在印度尼西亚政府的领导下，印度尼西亚人民决定在联合国以外展开斗争来解决西伊里安问题。这些天来，印度尼西亚全国人民和爱国力量已经行动起来。在荷兰企业中工作的全体印度尼西亚工人举行了总罢工；印度尼西亚各地人民对荷兰殖民者展开了抵制运动；印度尼西亚政府并且接管了一些多少年来吮吸印度尼西亚人民膏血的荷兰企业。同时，印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约声明说，如果荷兰不倡议恢复谈判来讨论西伊里安的地位问题，印度尼西亚就将同荷兰断绝外交关系。
    印度尼西亚人民的这些行动表明，他们要求收复西伊里安的决心是坚定不渝的。印度尼西亚人民再不能容忍荷兰殖民者继续霸占他们的领土了。西伊里安必须归还印度尼西亚。“还我河山！”这就是印度尼西亚人民的举国一致的神圣要求。
    可是直到今天，荷兰殖民者不但拒绝同印度尼西亚举行谈判，反而继续向西伊里安增派军舰。荷兰政府并且让北大西洋集团开了一个“紧急会议”来讨论印度尼西亚局势，企图依仗西方殖民国家的势力，共同干涉和镇压印度尼西亚人民的爱国运动。同时，美国等西方殖民国家公然替荷兰殖民者撑腰。美国国务院发言人表示美国可能要“告诫”印度尼西亚“小心行事”。美国通讯社更用种种歪曲宣传来恫吓印度尼西亚人民，说什么印度尼西亚人民如果坚决反对荷兰殖民者，印度尼西亚的经济就要“崩溃”。
    但是西方殖民者的算盘打错了。现在已经不是亚洲人民听命于西方殖民者的“告诫”的时候了。须要“告诫”的倒是美、荷殖民者。印度尼西亚政府因荷兰政府拒绝恢复谈判和联合国大会不能履行其职务而被迫采取爱国行动，这是完全合理的。中国人民和亚非各国人民一起，和全世界广大人民一起，同情和支持印度尼西亚人民的正义斗争。正义的事业是一定要胜利的，正在崩溃的不是别人，恰恰是在亚洲和非洲的一切殖民势力！
