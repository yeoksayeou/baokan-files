Notes

    Anderson's "Compassion"
    The so-called United Nations "Special Committee on the Hungarian Problem," illegally established under the planning of the United States, recently issued a statement by the committee's "Chairman," Anderson, in order to remind the world not to forget its existence.

    Without avoiding the suspicion of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, Anderson openly "demanded" that the Hungarian government "adopt the highest humanitarian standards" in dealing with the counter-revolutionary rioters in the October incident last year. Without any sympathy for the real victims of the October incident, but with great compassion for the murderers and thugs who do not blink an eye, Anderson, this humanitarian, is even more shameless than the Western countries' "dog-humanitarians" who "protested" against the Soviet Union putting "Laika" in an artificial satellite.

    安德生的“慈悲”
    在美国策划下非法成立的所谓联合国“匈牙利问题特别委员会”，为了提醒世人不要忘却它的存在，最近由这个委员会的“主席”安德生发表了一项声明。
    安德生不避干涉他国内政之嫌，公然“要求”匈牙利政府“采用最高的人道水平”来对待去年十月事件中的反革命暴乱分子。对十月事件的真正受害者毫无同情之心，而对那些杀人不眨眼的凶手暴徒却大发慈悲，安德生这位人道主义者比那些“抗议”苏联把“莱伊卡”放在人造卫星中的西方国家的“狗道主义”者还不要脸。
