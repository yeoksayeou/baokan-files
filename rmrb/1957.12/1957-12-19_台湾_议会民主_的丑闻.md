　　Scandal of Taiwan's "Parliamentary Democracy"
　　Gu Fan
　　December in Taiwan presents a desolate, terrifying, and chaotic year-end scene. Shops in various towns and cities are closing down daily before the New Year. The Kuomintang's military police and secret agents have begun winter martial law. What feels particularly noisy is the Chiang Kai-shek group's active preparation in Taiwan's counties and cities for staging the ugly farce of "electing the fourth session of county and city councilors."

　　According to the regulations of the Chiang Kai-shek group, Taiwan has a "Provincial Assembly" and "County and City Councils," whose members are nominally "democratically elected." These councilors serve three-year terms. The Provincial Assembly members were already re-elected in April of this year. The election of the fourth session of county and city councilors will take place in mid-January next year. Currently, the Chiang Kai-shek group has established "election offices" in twenty-one counties and cities in Taiwan, preparing to elect one thousand and twenty-five county and city councilors.

　　American propaganda agencies frequently tout this "parliamentary politics" in Taiwan, claiming it is "true American-style democracy." Currently, individuals in various counties and cities in Taiwan participating in the "election" to become councilors are actively seeking and running around, currying favor and hosting banquets. Several restaurants in Taipei City have been packed recently, with booming business, and most of their patrons are those participating in the "councilor election." They invite batches of Kuomintang bureaucrats and politicians for banquets every day, to grease the wheels. There are also batches of loafers participating in "election campaign groups," whom Taiwanese society calls "election scalpers," who are also among those invited to restaurants. In addition, to make the "campaign activities" more lively, the Kuomintang instructs each councilor candidate to come up with all sorts of gimmicks. Some have installed paper-made cannons on their campaign vehicles, indicating that they will frequently "fire cannons" after being elected as councilors. Others are holding signs that say "Please vote for me" and are trying to win people over everywhere.

　　According to materials revealed by Taiwanese newspapers, those who are currently councilors in Taiwan or participating in the next election are a group of bureaucratic compradors and feudal landlords, or their clerks and lackeys. Among these people are managers, lawyers, and consultants of Taiwanese bureaucratic capitalist enterprises, feudal landlords and the landlords' "land agents," as well as gangsters and political brokers. Councilors can be divided into three categories: "professional councilors" who make a living by being councilors, "business councilors" who use their position as councilors to develop their private businesses, and "status councilors" who use their councilor status to maintain their private property. These councilors, for their own interests, also form feudal groups such as the "Eighteen Elder Brothers Group."

　　It is estimated that in recent years, it costs about 50,000 Taiwan dollars in activity expenses to become a provincial councilor in Taiwan. To become a county or city councilor, it costs about 20,000 Taiwan dollars. 20,000 Taiwan dollars can buy 12,000 catties of rice in Taipei City. People who become councilors not only want to recoup their costs but also want to seize great profits. Therefore, the Taiwanese people call councilors "locusts." Taiwanese newspapers say that Taiwanese councilors like to establish "project teams" because "first, they can go to restaurants; second, they can see what the market is like and where there are opportunities to make money; third, they can make a lot of investigation fees." Taiwanese councilors also like to organize "inspection tours." For example, in October of this year, the Taiwan Provincial Assembly formed a "public enterprise inspection tour." Nominally, the councilors were divided into groups to "inspect" various factories, enterprises, and companies; in reality, they were "robbing each other," because those Kuomintang officials in charge of Taiwan's "public enterprises" are corrupt, and they inevitably have to share a portion of the embezzled money with the councilors who come to "inspect."

　　The Taiwanese people also call these councilors "piglet councilors" because their "duty" is actually just to be accomplices and hangers-on for the Chiang Kai-shek group's "administrative authorities at all levels." On October 1st, the Taiwan Provincial Assembly passed 159 cases submitted by the Chiang Kai-shek group's Taiwan Provincial Government in two hours. On October 28th, the Taipei City Council passed more than 170 proposals in two hours, averaging about three proposals every two minutes. Taiwanese newspapers called this opening a "special express train" on orders and said: "It is easy to imagine the councilors raising their hands in a hurry."

　　Taiwanese piglet councilors are lively and energetic when they participate in "project teams," "inspection tours," or various opportunities to collect money, but they are not interested in attending council meetings and often simply go to restaurants and brothels during meeting times. Taiwan's "New Life Daily" once published a scene of the Taipei County Council holding a general meeting on November 8th, excerpted as follows:

　　"The ninth meeting of the third session of the Taipei County Council entered its second day yesterday. Because the councilors did not attend enthusiastically, the venue was deserted. It was not until 11:00 AM that the legal quorum was barely reached, and the meeting was convened with a bell. The agenda yesterday was to continue to conduct work inquiries with ten units in the county, presided over by Speaker Bai and Deputy Speaker Li respectively. Because the councilors were listless and spoke sporadically, the meeting was only held for more than ten minutes in the morning before it was adjourned for lunch. Although the meeting started on time at 1:30 PM in the afternoon, the councilors soon slipped out of the venue one by one, leaving only a dozen councilors leaning crookedly in their seats, and the desolation made the voters sitting in the audience shake their heads. In total, only a few councilors, such as Zhuo Hongyi, spoke yesterday. The inquiries they raised were mostly trivial issues..."

　　This news from "New Life Daily" vividly depicts the ugliness of Taiwan's "American-style parliamentary democracy."

　　In the previous "councilor elections," you couldn't find one in ten Taiwanese residents who voluntarily went to vote. The creation of piglet councilors is actually handled entirely by the Kuomintang. Rigging and cheating in "elections" has become an open secret. Whoever spends more money and has evil forces can become a piglet councilor and have the opportunity to blackmail, which is also well known in Taiwan. Therefore, there are two folk songs in Taiwan: "The parliament gate is wide open, those with money but not qualified (议会大门八字开，有议无元(员)不进来) cannot enter." (Xinhua News Agency)

### 台湾“议会民主”的丑闻

　　台湾“议会民主”的丑闻
　　古凡
    12月的台湾，出现了一片萧条、恐怖和混乱的残年景色。各市镇每天都有商店在年关前倒闭。国民党的军警特务开始冬令戒严。使人感到闹哄哄的，是蒋介石集团在台湾各县市积极准备上演“选举第四届县市议员”的丑剧。
    按照蒋介石集团的规定，台湾设有“省议会”和“县市议会”，其中的议员名义上都是“民主选举”的。这些议员的任期为三年。省议员已经在今年4月间改选。第四届县市议员将在明年1月中旬选举。现在，蒋介石集团在台湾二十一个县市都已经成立了“选举事务所”，准备选举出一千零二十五名县市议员。
    美国宣传机构经常为台湾这种“议会政治” 吹嘘，说这是“美国式的真正的民主”。现在，台湾各县市参加“竞选”当议员的人物，正在到处钻营奔走，拉拢请客。台北市有几家酒楼，近来座无虚席，生意兴隆，主顾大部分是那些参加“议员竞选”的人。他们天天请一批批的国民党官僚、政客饮宴，疏通关系。还有一批批参加“助选团”的二流子，台湾社会上把他们叫做“选举黄牛”，也在被请上酒家之列。此外，为了使“竞选活动”热闹一些，国民党指使各议员候选人要出各种各样的噱头。有人在竞选宣传车上装上了纸扎的大炮，表示当选为议员后要经常“放炮”。还有人拿着“请投我一票”的牌子，到处笼络人。
    根据台湾报纸透露的材料，台湾正在当议员或参加竞选下届议员的人，都是一群官僚买办和封建豪绅，或是他们的师爷、狗腿之类。这些人中间，有台湾官僚资本企业的经理、律师和顾问，有封建地主和地主的“土地代书人”，还有流氓和政治掮客。议员中又可分为靠当议员成家立业的“职业议员”，借当议员机会发展私人事业的“事业议员”，靠议员地位来维护私人产业的“地位议员”这三大类。这些议员为了利害关系，互相间又组成“十八大哥集团”等封建团体。
    据估计，近年在台湾要当一名省议员，要花大约台币五万元的活动费。要当一名县市议员，要花大约台币二万元的活动费。台币二万元在台北市可购买一万二千市斤稻谷。当上了议员的人，不光要捞回成本，而且要攫取大利。因此，台湾人民把议员称做“蝗虫”。台湾报纸说，台湾的议员们最喜欢成立“专案小组”，因为“一来有得上酒家；二来可以看看行情，哪儿有捞的机会；三来可以大捞调查费。”台湾议员们还喜欢组织“考察团”。例如今年10月间，台湾省议员就组成了“公营企业考察团”，名义上，各议员是分组到各工厂、企业、公司去“考察”；实际上，却是去“以黑吃黑”，因为那些负责主管台湾各“公营企业”的国民党官员，是无官不贪的，免不了要分一份赃款给前来“考察”的议员们。
    台湾人民还把这些议员叫做“猪仔议员”，因为他们的“职责”实际上只是给蒋介石集团的“各级行政当局”帮凶和帮闲。10月1日，台湾省议会在两个小时内通过了蒋介石集团台湾省政府等提交的案件一百五十九件。台北市议会在10月28日两小时内通过了提案一百七十多件，平均约二分钟通过三件议案。台湾报纸称为这是奉命开“特别快车”，并且说：“议员先生们举手匆忙，己可想见一斑。”
    台湾猪仔议员们遇到参加“专案小组”、“考察团”或各种搜刮钱财的机会，个个生龙活虎，但对参加议会的会议都不感兴趣，往往干脆在开会时间上酒家，逛妓院。台湾“新生报”曾登载台北县议会在11月8日举行大会的情景，抄录如下：
      “台北县议会三届九次大会，昨日进入第二天。因为议员们出席不甚踊跃，会场冷冷清清。直至上午十一时，始勉强凑足法定人数，摇铃开会。昨日议程系继续向县内十单位进行工作询问，仍由白议长及李副议长分别主持。因议员诸君有气无力，发言零零落落，故上午仅开会十余分钟，即宣布休息午餐。下午虽然依时于一时三十分开会，但不久议员们又一个个溜出会场，只剩下十几个议员七歪八斜地靠在位子上，其冷落的情形，直令坐在旁听席上的选民大摇其头。综计昨日发言的议员，仅有卓宏义等寥寥几个人。其所提询问，亦多为一些七零八碎的问题。……”
    “新生报”这条消息，活生生地描画出台湾“美式议会民主”的丑态。
    在历次“议员选举”中，台湾居民自动前去投票的，十人中找不到一人。猪仔议员的产生，实际上由国民党一手包办。在“选举”中弄虚作假，已经成为公开的秘密。谁出钱多，有恶势力，谁就能当上猪仔议员，就有机会敲诈勒索，这在台湾也是众所周知的事。因此，台湾有两句民谣：“议会大门八字开，有议无元（员）不进来”。（新华社）
