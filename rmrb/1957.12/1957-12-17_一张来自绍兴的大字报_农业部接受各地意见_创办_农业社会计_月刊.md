At the National Agricultural Cooperative Financial Accounting Work Conference held in 1955 and the agricultural cooperative financial work forum held in eleven provinces in July of this year, representatives from various regions have all raised the opinion of running such a publication, and the Ministry of Agriculture has received many letters from various regions reflecting this opinion over the years. Now, the inaugural issue of "Agricultural Accounting" has been compiled and will be available to readers on New Year's Day 1958. The inaugural issue contains a total of twenty articles, including the opening remarks "Conscientiously Do a Good Job in the Financial Management of Agricultural Cooperatives," which were written by Vice Premier of the State Council Deng Zihui.

    农业部接受各地意见  创办“农业社会计”月刊
    据新华社讯　农业部12日贴出了一张来自浙江省绍兴县的大报字，对农业部在整风运动中接受各地农业社会计工作人员的要求，决定立即创办一个名叫“农业社会计”的月刊，表示极大的欢迎。
    这个月刊的主要任务是传播各地农业社有关财务管理、会计工作、收益分配和会计辅导工作等方面的经验和情况。
    这张大字报是从正在举行的绍兴县铁清区第十六次全体农业社财务会计大会上寄来的，有一百二十一个人在上面签了名。大字报说，当他们看到要创办这个刊物的传单的时候，大家都欢欣鼓舞，并且深信这对提高他们的财务会计工作一定会有极大的帮助。他们还表示，今后一定要积极写稿，来支持这个刊物。
    目前，全国农业社的会计员有一百多万、会计辅导员有两万多，各个农业社生产队的记工员的人数则更多。很长时间以来，他们都有创办一个交流农业社会计业务工作经验刊物的要求。在1955年举行的全国农业社财务会计工作会议和今年7月间举行的十一省农业社财务工作座谈会上，各地的代表都提出过要办这样一个刊物的意见，几年来农业部收到各地的来信中，反映这种意见的也很多。现在，“农业社会计”的创刊号已经编排好，1958年元旦就可和读者见面。登在创刊号上的文章共有二十篇，其中“认真做好农业社的财务管理工作”的发刊词，是由国务院副总理邓子恢撰写的。
