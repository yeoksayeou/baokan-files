Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th (TASS) - The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union passed a resolution on the work of Soviet trade unions at its plenary meeting held from December 16th to 17th, believing that all work of Soviet trade unions must be greatly improved.

    This resolution was passed based on the report made by Grishin, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, at the plenary meeting.

    The resolution pointed out that the reorganization of industrial and construction management in the Soviet Union has achieved initial results. The Soviet Union can and must increase the production of industries of decisive significance by one to two times in the next fifteen years, ensure a rapid upsurge in agriculture in the next few years, and greatly improve the living standards of the working people.

    The Central Committee plenary meeting pointed out that the Soviet Union already has favorable conditions to solve the main economic task of the Soviet Union—to catch up with and surpass the largest capitalist countries, including the United States, in terms of per capita product output.

    The resolution of the CPSU Central Committee, when discussing strengthening the role of trade unions in economic construction, pointed out that socialist competition and production meetings are some forms of attracting the working people to participate in production management. The resolution pointed out that it is appropriate to hold regular production meetings in enterprises and construction sites. The resolution also pointed out the need to strengthen the work of trade unions in carrying out rationalization and invention movements.

    The resolution said that Soviet economic organs must consider the opinions of trade union committees when studying current labor and life issues. Since the work of the State Labor and Wages Committee of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union directly affects the vital interests of employees, it is stipulated that the most important issues should be jointly decided by this committee and the Presidium of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions.

    The resolution attaches great importance to the issue of further improving the labor and living conditions of employees. The resolution believes that this is an extremely important task of the trade unions. In the past five years alone, the state has allocated more than 11 billion rubles to existing enterprises for labor protection and safety technology expenses.

    The Central Committee plenary meeting believes that, taking into account the latest scientific and technological achievements, supplementary measures to establish labor safety conditions in mining, metallurgy, chemical enterprises and other production sectors must also be stipulated in the 1959-1965 long-term plan for national economic development.

    Trade unions should actively assist in completing large-scale construction and cultural construction work, strengthen the influence on the work of commercial and public catering enterprises, and improve social insurance and social security undertakings.

    In terms of improving the organizational work level of Soviet trade unions, the CPSU Central Committee plenary meeting resolution believes that it is appropriate to expand the functions of factory trade union committees and grant them the power to participate in the formulation of enterprise production plans and financial plans. Factory trade union committees also have the right to supervise the observance of labor laws and the implementation of collective contracts, have the right to express their opinions on the qualifications of candidates nominated for economic leadership positions, and have the right to disallow the dismissal of employees without the consent of the trade union committee.

    The resolution said that the CPSU Central Committee plenary meeting believes that Soviet trade unions should continue to activate their international activities in the future, focusing their main efforts on overcoming the division in the international workers' movement and trade union movement and striving for united action to prevent new war threats, striving to stop the testing of nuclear weapons and completely prohibit such weapons, improving the living and working conditions of the working class, and striving for the democratic freedom of all peoples.

    The resolution pointed out that the task of Soviet trade unions is to actively promote the consolidation of the World Federation of Trade Unions, attach importance to further strengthening brotherly ties and cooperation with trade unions in China and other socialist countries, and exchange work experience and experience in participating in national construction, economic construction, and cultural construction.

    苏联工会工作要根据国家经济任务进行改善
    争取十五年内把生产力提高一至二倍
    新华社19日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科18日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会在12月16日到17日举行的全体会议通过了一项关于苏联工会工作的决议，认为必须大大地改善苏联工会的所有工作。
    这项决议是根据全苏工会中央理事会主席格里申在全体会议上所作的报告通过的。
    决议指出，苏联工业和建设管理的改组工作，已经获得初步成效。苏联可以而且必须使具有决定意义的工业部门的生产在今后十五年内增加一、两倍，保证农业在最近若干年内得到急剧高涨和大大提高劳动人民的生活水平。
    中央全会指出，苏联已经具备了良好的条件来解决苏联的主要经济任务——在按人口计算的产品产量方面赶上和超过包括美国在内的最大的资本主义国家。
    苏共中央全会的决议在谈到加强工会在经济建设中的作用时指出，社会主义竞赛和生产会议是吸引劳动人民参与生产管理的一些形式。决议指出，定期召开企业和建筑工地上的生产会议是适宜的。决议还指出了加强工会在开展合理化和创造发明运动方面的工作的必要性。
    决议说，苏联的经济机关在研究当前的劳动和生活问题时，必须考虑工会委员会的意见。由于苏联部长会议国家劳动和工资问题委员会的工作直接涉及职工的切身利益，因此规定，最重大的问题要由这个委员会和全苏工会中央理事会主席团共同决定。
    决议很重视进一步改善职工的劳动和生活条件的问题。决议认为，这是工会的一项极为重要的任务。仅在过去五年中，国家给现有企业拨出的劳保和安全技术费用就达一百一十亿卢布以上。
    中央全会认为，考虑到最新的科学和技术成就，在1959—1965年国民经济发展远景计划中还必须规定在采矿、冶金、化学企业和其他生产部门中建立劳动安全条件的补充措施。
    工会应当积极协助完成大规模的建设和文化建设工作，加强对商业和公共饮食企业工作的影响，改进社会保险和社会赡养事业。
    在提高苏联工会组织工作水平方面，苏共中央全会决议认为扩大工厂工会委员会的职能、给予它们参加制订企业生产计划和财政计划的权力，是适宜的。工厂工会委员会还有权对劳动法的遵守情况和集体合同的执行情况进行监督，有权对被提名担任经济领导职务的人的候选资格发表自己的意见，有权在未经工会委员会同意时不允许解雇职工。
    决议说，苏共中央全会认为，苏联工会今后仍然应当使自己的国际活动活跃起来，把主要力量用于克服国际工人运动和工会运动的分裂现象并且争取一致行动来防止新战争威胁，争取停止试验核武器和完全禁止这类武器，改善工人阶级生活和劳动条件，争取各国人民的民主自由。
    决议指出，苏联工会的任务是积极促进世界工会联合会的巩固，重视进一步加强同中国和其他社会主义国家工会的兄弟联系和合作，互相交流工作经验和参加国家建设、经济建设和文化建设的经验。
