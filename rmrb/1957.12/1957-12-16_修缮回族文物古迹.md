    Repairing Hui Ethnic Group Cultural Relics and Historic Sites
    The Fujian Provincial Bureau of Culture recently allocated more than 6,000 yuan to help repair the earliest Hui ethnic group cultural relics and historic sites in China: the Quanzhou Qingjing Mosque and the Tombs of the Three Sages and Four Sages. The repair project has now begun, and relevant departments in Quanzhou and representatives of the Hui residents have jointly established a "Commission for the Repair of Islamic Relics" to be responsible for the repair work.
    The Quanzhou Qingjing Mosque, also known as the Kirin Mosque, together with the Guangzhou Huaisheng Mosque and the Hangzhou Phoenix Mosque, are known as the three major ancient Islamic mosques along the coast of China. This mosque was built in the second year of Dazhong Xiangfu in the Song Dynasty (1008 AD), and has a history of more than 940 years. It has a unique style of ancient Arab mosque mixed with ancient Chinese architecture. The Three Sages and Four Sages were disciples of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad who came to Quanzhou from southern Arabia in the fifth year of Wude in the Tang Dynasty (622 AD) to preach. They were buried in Lingshan after their deaths, and their tombs still exist today.

    修缮回族文物古迹
    福建省文化局最近拨款六千多元，帮助修缮我国最早的回族文物古迹——泉州清真寺和三贤四贤坟。现在修缮工程已经开始，泉州市有关部门和回族居民代表还联合成立了“回教遗迹修建委员会”，负责修缮工作。
    泉州清真寺即清净寺，又名麒麟寺，和广州怀圣寺、杭州凤凰寺合称为我国沿海三大古伊斯兰教寺。这个寺建筑于宋朝大中祥符二年（公元1008年），至今已有九百四十多年的历史，具有阿拉伯古代寺院混合我国古建筑的独特风格。三贤四贤是穆斯林至圣穆罕默德的门徒，在唐朝武德五年（公元622年），由阿拉伯南部来泉州传教，死后葬在灵山，至今坟墓尚在。
