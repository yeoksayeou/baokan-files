　　Western Observers Discuss the Paris Conference
    Many Feel Pessimistic About the Future of the North Atlantic Group
    Kennan Advocates Not Overly Strengthening the Atlantic Group
    Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, George F. Kennan, warned the West in a radio address on the evening of the 15th not to over strengthen the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, lest it damage the chances of easing the danger of a full-scale war through peaceful negotiations, although he said that the North Atlantic Treaty nations must maintain their strength.
    Kennan, who was once one of the designers of American foreign policy, said on the eve of the opening of the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic military group: The West should not expect the conference table of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to provide the basic strength on which the security of the Western world must rely. He also said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's top-level meeting cannot play a decisive role in resolving international problems.
    Kennan said that the crisis currently facing the West is not one that can be dealt with by direct use of weapons. Only by not taking open military action can the West prevail in this crisis, or rather, can the West overcome this crisis.
    Kennan warned people not to immediately think that all the letters sent by the Soviet government leaders to Western countries in recent weeks are insincere. Kennan said, "It is useless to think that merely strengthening the North Atlantic Treaty Organization can provide the necessary atmosphere and background for negotiations with the Soviet Union."
    Kennan advocated that the West put aside the method of solving problems by military means and build its security on earnestly striving to do constructive things.
    Lippmann Believes That the United States' Position in the "Alliance" Has Greatly Declined
    American columnist Walter Lippmann recently published an article in the "Washington Post" saying that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has encountered "difficulties" because the Soviet Union broke the U.S. monopoly on the atomic bomb in 1949 and because of the recent Soviet lead in rockets and missiles. He said: "This is a completely new situation, very different from the situation when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was established. It is under this changed situation that the current crisis has unfolded."
    Lippmann said that when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was established nearly ten years ago, Western European countries regarded the strength of the United States as a "guarantee." However, "from 1949, when the Soviet Union first mastered the atomic bomb, the U.S. guarantee became less and less significant."
    The commentator said: By the 1950s, especially in the months shortly before the famous 1955 Geneva summit conference, there was no longer any certainty that our allies could escape destruction in the event of a major war. It was precisely this that produced a rising tide of what we call neutralism. In fact, neutralism is a force that reduces the likelihood of getting involved in a world war. However, during this period (certainly before this autumn), there was still a belief among our allies that the territory of the United States on the mainland was not easily attacked. Based on this belief, it was believed that the strength of the United States would be relied upon to deter "aggression" with the threat of massive retaliation.
    He went on to say: "Since the confirmation that the Soviet Union has moved ahead of the United States in the military art of rockets and missile inventions, this belief, if not shattered, has at least been severely damaged. As for the newer weapons of war, it has become clear that this country will only be able to catch up with the Russians after a considerable number of years of serious effort."
    Lippmann said that in the changed situation, "we are no longer the patron state of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."
    French "Le Monde" Points Out That Member States Harbor Different Dreams
    The Paris newspaper "Le Monde" commented on the speeches given by Eisenhower, Gaillard, and Burke at the opening meeting of the North Atlantic Group's top-level conference on the 16th, pointing out that these speeches "did not contain anything truly novel."
    The newspaper's editorial wrote: "The initial intentions of the various delegations are clearly divergent. In the United States' view, the main issue is to restore the strategic balance that has been disrupted by the Soviet Union's manufacture of intercontinental weapons. Britain hopes to consolidate its special position second only to the United States, while Gaillard is very concerned with seeking ways to make people respect France's main interests both inside and outside the alliance—especially its interests in North Africa. Adenauer will strive to strengthen political and economic activities. ... Menderes hopes to win the agreement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries to restore the 1947 plan to divide Palestine. ... The Scandinavian countries will express opposition to any action that expands the power of the North Atlantic Alliance or changes the nature of this alliance." The editorial believes that "this series of messy problems is quite contradictory," and in order to reach a "minimum agreement," "there needs to be a spirit of equality. But in a group composed of members unequal to each other, it is difficult to achieve equality."
    "Le Monde" also pointed out that the Soviet proposals are attracting increasing attention from the delegations of the North Atlantic Group. The newspaper believes that the North Atlantic Group's top-level conference should strive to negotiate with the Soviet Union. Otherwise, this group will "get nothing and will be forced to reduce its influence in the world." The newspaper said: At the meeting currently being held, "the mood calling for negotiations with the East is growing."
    West German "Die Welt" Says Military Group Can Hardly Guarantee Western Superiority
    The influential West German bourgeois newspaper "Die Welt" published an editorial on the 16th saying that at the Paris conference, "the leaders of the North Atlantic Group are attempting to inject new vitality into their alliance," "but before the meeting began, there were not many signs that they had learned anything from their mistakes."
    The editorial pointed out that in order to prompt Western leaders to come to Paris for a grand gathering, "often such a driving force is needed: fear." This meeting, like the North Atlantic Group itself, was produced under the "driving force of fear," which makes the North Atlantic Group play only a "passive role" in the face of Soviet superiority.
    The editorial pointed out that it is a "big mistake" to think that relying on the North Atlantic Group can "guarantee Western superiority." The "tragic consequences" of this mistake "have become clearer day by day."
    The editorial also emphasized that the North Atlantic Group cannot coordinate the "political interests" of Western countries.
    The editorial pointed out: "This meeting, despite saying some words about strengthening Western goals and ideals, and despite reaching new agreements on military cooperation, cannot solve any political problems." (Xinhua News Agency)

### 西方观察家议论巴黎会议  对北大西洋集团前途多感悲观

　　西方观察家议论巴黎会议
    对北大西洋集团前途多感悲观
    凯南主张不要过分加强大西洋集团
    前美国驻苏联大使乔治·弗·凯南15日晚上在一次广播演说中警告西方不要太多地加强北大西洋公约组织，以免损害通过和平谈判来缓和一次全面战争的危险的机会，虽然他说北大西洋公约国家还必须保持自己的实力。
    这位曾经一度是美国外交政策设计人之一的凯南在北大西洋军事集团巴黎会议开幕前夕说：西方不要指望北大西洋公约组织的会议桌给西方世界的安全提供所必须依靠的基本力量。他并且说北大西洋公约组织最高级会议并不能在解决国际问题方面发生决定性作用。
    凯南说，西方目前面临的危机并不是一个直接使用武器就能对付得了的危机，只有不采取公开的军事行动，才能使西方在这一危机中得胜，或者说，才能使西方渡过这一危机。
    凯南警告人们不要立刻认为最近几个星期中苏联政府领导人向西方国家发出的所有信件是没有诚意的。凯南说，“如果以为只要单单加强北大西洋公约组织就可以为同苏联举行的谈判提供必要的气氛和背景的话，那是没有用的”。
    凯南主张西方把用军事手段解决问题的办法搁在一边，而把西方的安全建立在认真努力做建设性的事情上。
    李普曼认为美国在“联盟”中地位大落
    美国专栏作家李普曼最近在“华盛顿邮报”发表文章说，由于苏联在1949年打破了美国对原子弹的垄断以及最近苏联在火箭和导弹方面的占先，北大西洋公约组织已经遇到了“难题”。他说：“这是一个全新的局面，较之北大西洋公约组织成立时的情形已大不相同，也就是在这种改变了的局势下，展开了目前的危机。”
    李普曼说，在将近十年前北大西洋公约组织成立的时候，西欧国家还把美国的力量当作是一种“担保”。但是，“从1949年苏联第一次掌握了原子弹开始，美国的担保就变得愈来愈不算什么了。”
    这位评论员说：到了五十年代，特别是在著名的1955年日内瓦最高级会议前不久的几个月里，已不再有任何把握一旦发生一场大战时我们的盟国能够免遭毁坏。正是这一点产生了一种我们简称之为中立主义的上涨的潮流。实际上，中立主义是一种减少卷入世界大战的可能性的动力。但是，在这个时期内（当然是在今年秋季以前），我们盟国中间仍旧有这样一个信念，那就是美国在大陆上的领土是不易遭受攻击的。基于这种信念，人们相信，要靠美国的力量，以大规模报复的威胁来制止“进攻”。
    他接着说：“由于证实了苏联在火箭的军事艺术及导弹发明上已经走在美国前头，这种信念即使没有粉碎，至少已经受到严重的损伤。至于更新的战争武器，已经表明，这个国家只有经过相当年数的认真努力以后才可能同俄国人并驾齐驱。”
    李普曼说，在改变了的局势下，“我们不再是北大西洋公约组织的施主国了。”
    法国“世界报”指出各成员国同床异梦
    巴黎“世界报”16日在评论艾森豪威尔、盖伊阿和伯克在北大西洋集团最高级会议的开幕会议上发表的演说时指出，这些演说“没有包含任何真正新颖的东西”。
    这家报纸的社论写道：“各国代表团一开头所抱的意向，显然是有分歧的。在美国看来，主要的问题在于恢复由于苏联制造出洲际武器而被破坏的战略平衡。英国希望巩固它仅次于美国的特殊地位，而盖伊阿考虑得很多的是寻求使人们在联盟内外尊重法国的主要利益——特别是它在北非的利益——的方法。阿登纳将争取加强政治上和经济上的活动。……曼德列斯希望争取北大西洋公约组织各国同意恢复1947年瓜分巴勒斯坦的计划。……斯堪的纳维亚各国则将表示反对扩大北大西洋联盟的权力和改变这个联盟性质的任何行动。”社论认为：“这一系列乱七八糟的问题是相当矛盾的”，而为了达成“最低限度的协议”，“那就需要有一种平等精神。可是在一个由彼此之间不平等的成员所组成的团体里，要实现平等是困难的”。
    “世界报”还指出，苏联的建议正在引起北大西洋集团中各国代表团越来越大的注意。报纸认为，北大西洋集团最高级会议应该争取同苏联进行谈判。否则这个集团就会“什么也得不到，并且将被迫缩小它自己在全世界的影响”。报纸说：在目前正在举行的会议上，“要求同东方谈判的情绪正在增长”。
    西德“世界报”说军事集团难保西方优势
    西德有影响的资产阶级报纸“世界报”16日发表了一篇社论说，在巴黎会议上，“北大西洋集团的领袖们企图给他们的联盟注射新的活力”，“但是，在会议开始以前没有很多迹象表明，他们已经从错误中学到了什么”。
    社论指出，为了促使西方领袖们到巴黎来作大聚会，“常常是需要这样一种推动力：恐惧”。这次会议同北大西洋集团本身一样，都是在“恐惧的推动力”之下产生的，这使得北大西洋集团在苏联的优势面前只能起到一种“消极性的作用”。
    社论指出，以为依靠北大西洋集团就可以“保证西方的优势”，这是一个“很大的错误”。这个错误的“悲剧性的后果已经一天比一天明显”。
    社论还强调说，北大西洋集团不能协调西方各国的“政治利益”。
    社论指出：“这次会议尽管会说一些加强西方目标和理想的话，尽管也会在军事合作方面达成新的协议，但是，却不可能解决任何一种政治问题。”（新华社）
