    Let Wind Power Serve Production
    (Our report) The fact that wind, which harms agricultural production, is being tamed to serve agricultural production is a new phenomenon that has emerged in the Baicheng Special District of Jilin Province for more than a year.

    The Baicheng area has historically suffered from wind, sand, and drought disasters. Although 1956 was a year of bumper harvests, the average yield per hectare in Baicheng County was only about 1,000 kilograms. To combat wind, sand, and drought, the entire special district has dug more than 33,000 wells over the past few years, but there are still difficulties in water lifting. In July of last year, the Jilin Provincial Planning Commission and the Baicheng Special District Water Conservancy Office began to trial-produce and promote windmills. A windmill with a diameter of five meters can irrigate 44 hectares of dry land and 10 hectares of paddy fields, drain 210 hectares of waterlogged land, and provide drinking water for more than 11,600 livestock per year. The water output of windmills is about 20% more than that of a Liberation-style waterwheel pulled by a horse, and a windmill only costs more than 150 yuan, which is cheaper than using a coal-fired engine or a gas engine. Therefore, it is welcomed by farmers. At the beginning of this year, 50 windmills have been promoted throughout the special district, and a preliminary plan is to supply another 500 windmills next year.

    让风力为生产服务
    本报讯　让危害农业生产的风驯服地为农业生产服务，这是吉林省白城专区一年多以来出现的新鲜事。
    白城地区历来受风沙和干旱的灾害，1956年是大丰收年，白城县每公顷的平均产量也只有一千公斤左右。为了抗御风沙和干旱，全专区几年来已经打三万三千多眼井，可是在提水方面仍然有困难。去年7月，吉林省计划委员会和白城专署水利处开始试制和推广风车。一台直径五公尺的风车全年可浇旱田四十四公顷、灌溉水田十公顷，排内涝二百一十公顷，还可供给一万一千六百多头牲畜饮水。用风车提水，出水量比一匹马拉的解放式水车约多20％，而且一台风车只需一百五十多元，比使用锅驼机、煤气机都便宜，因此受到农民的欢迎。今年年初，全专区已经推广了风车五十台，初步计划明年再供应五百台。
