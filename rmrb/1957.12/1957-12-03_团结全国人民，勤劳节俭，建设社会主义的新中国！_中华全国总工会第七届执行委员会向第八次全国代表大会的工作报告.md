Comrades,

I am entrusted by the Seventh Executive Committee to report on the work of the trade unions to the Eighth National Congress. Please review it.

I. Overview of Trade Union Work Over the Past Four Years

Since the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Trade Unions in 1953, more than four years have passed. During this period, our country has undergone a great historical transformation. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese working class and the people of the nation have achieved the basic victory of the socialist revolution. In 1956, agriculture and handicrafts were collectivized, and capitalist industry and commerce were transformed into joint state-private enterprises, thus achieving the basic victory of the socialist revolution in the economic field. In 1957, the counter-revolutionary rightist elements were defeated, and the rectification movement was carried out among the people, thus achieving new victories in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. The history of class exploitation in China, which has lasted for thousands of years, has thus come to an end.

During these more than four years, our socialist construction has achieved brilliant results. The basic tasks and main indicators of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, which began in 1953, have now been completed or overfulfilled. The total industrial output value of the first Five-Year Plan was completed at 109.5% of the planned target in 1956, and the total industrial output value in 1957 will reach 230% of that in 1952. As the center of the first Five-Year Plan, the basic construction of industry, calculated by investment, will complete 106% of the plan over five years. Although agricultural production suffered two serious natural disasters in 1954 and 1956, the total grain output in 1956 reached the level planned for 1957 in the first Five-Year Plan. Transportation, finance, trade, and cultural and educational undertakings have also developed significantly. On the basis of the great development of the national economy, the material and cultural lives of the workers and the people have also improved accordingly.

In the socialist revolution and socialist construction, the Chinese working class has been at the forefront of the struggle. Under the leadership of its great vanguard, the Communist Party of China, it has fought bravely alongside the people of the nation, demonstrating boundless courage, diligence, and contributing its wisdom and strength.

The facts prove that the Chinese working class, together with the people of the nation, can overcome all obstacles and difficulties on the road ahead and can shoulder the tasks of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and will certainly achieve a thorough victory. The plot of the bourgeois rightists to overthrow the leadership of the working class and the socialist system has failed; any reactionary forces that attempt to drag the Chinese people back to the old path of slavery and exploitation are doomed to fail.

As a mass organization of the working class, the trade unions have, over the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, carried out extensive ideological and organizational work among the workers, raising their level of consciousness and organization. The trade unions have played a significant role in socialist transformation and socialist construction.

The Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Trade Unions, in accordance with the Party's general line for the transitional period, formulated the policy for trade union work during the construction period. This policy is: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, to unite and educate the workers, to continuously raise the level of consciousness and organization of the workers, to consolidate the alliance between workers and peasants, to unite the people of all strata, to actively fulfill the national construction plan, and on the basis of developing production, to gradually improve the material and cultural lives of the working class and the people, and to struggle for the gradual realization of the industrialization of the country and the transition to a socialist society."

Over the past four years, the trade unions have been working in accordance with this policy.

To complete and overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, the trade unions have mobilized the workers to widely and deeply carry out socialist competition. In 1953, ideological education was conducted among trade union cadres to focus on production, strengthening the leadership of the competition. In 1954 and 1955, a socialist competition centered on improving technology, improving technology, learning, and mastering new technologies was launched, which greatly promoted the work of summarizing and popularizing advanced experience and organizing rationalization suggestions. In 1956, in the high tide of socialist revolution and socialist construction, in response to the Party Central Committee's call to build socialism in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical, a nationwide advanced producer movement of unprecedented scale was launched, which promoted the collective spirit of the workers and advanced the competition. Over the past four years, 2.6 million advanced producers have emerged among the workers nationwide, 4.56 million rationalization suggestions have been proposed, and tens of thousands of advanced experiences have been popularized, greatly improving labor productivity.

In private enterprises, the trade unions, in accordance with the Party's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, organized the workers to carry out comprehensive supervision. From the second half of 1955 to the first half of 1956, with the advent of the high tide of agricultural and handicraft cooperatives, the trade unions widely mobilized the masses to assist the government in promoting the implementation of the policy of joint state-private enterprises, helping the state representatives to inventory assets, determine funds, arrange personnel, and reorganize the economy, ensuring the smooth completion of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and rapidly developing the production of joint enterprises.

The trade unions have conducted communist education among the workers. In 1953 and 1954, the Party's general line for the transitional period and the consolidation of labor discipline were vigorously promoted nationwide; in 1955, through the rectification movement, the policy of rectification and the consolidation of proletarian dictatorship were educated; in 1956, in the high tide of socialist revolution and socialist construction, education was conducted on socialist revolution and the building of socialism in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical; in this year's rectification movement and the struggle against the rightist elements, communist education and education on increasing production and saving, building the country thriftily, and opposing the capitalist road have been and are being conducted on a larger scale and at a deeper level among the broad masses of workers. In organizing the workers to study culture and technology, the trade unions have also done a lot of work. Currently, more than 5 million workers are participating in part-time cultural studies, and even more are participating in technical studies and scientific lectures. These have had a good effect on raising the socialist consciousness and cultural and technical level of the workers. The trade unions have also made great efforts to improve the material and cultural lives of the workers. Over the years, the trade unions have assisted the government in implementing the Party's and the state's labor and wage policies, reforming the wage system, and raising wage standards. The wage level of workers in 1956 was 37% higher than in 1952. The total wage fund in 1952 was 6.7 billion yuan, and it is expected to reach 14.8 billion yuan in 1957, more than doubling. With the development of production, the workforce has rapidly expanded. Over eight years, the state has solved the employment problem for 13 million people, increasing the number of employed people by an average of 1.6 million per year. The nearly 4 million unemployed people left over from the old society have been basically settled. In labor protection work, the trade unions have assisted and supervised enterprise administration to improve working conditions and strengthen safety production. Over five years, the state has allocated 2.9 billion yuan for labor protection. The scope of labor insurance and free medical treatment has been continuously expanded, relieving the difficulties of birth, old age, illness, death, injury, and disability for the vast majority of workers. It is estimated that during the first Five-Year Plan period, the supplementary wages and various welfare expenses paid by state organs, enterprises, and public institutions amount to 9.6 billion yuan, accounting for 19.2% of the total wage, and if the part enjoyed by workers in the state's expenditure on social education, health, and social welfare is added, it reaches more than 25% of the total wage. The number of beds in the sanatoriums operated by the trade unions has reached more than 25,000, and there are 8,200 nurseries and lactation rooms at the grassroots level. In addition, relying on the strength of the workers and their families, 1,774 nurseries and kindergartens have been established in the workers' residential areas. Over five years, the state has invested in the construction of 80 million square meters of workers' housing. The cultural and artistic activities and sports of the workers in their spare time have also developed significantly. Compared with the hard life of hunger and cold endured by the workers before liberation, this is a world of difference.

The organizational construction of the trade unions has also made significant progress over the past few years. Currently, we have more than 16.3 million members and 3.89 million activists. In production, labor and wages, labor protection, labor insurance, living welfare, culture and education, sports, women workers and family members, trade union finances, and other aspects, we have accumulated a lot of work experience. Through various activities and undertakings, the trade unions have established close ties with the broad masses of workers and have become a strong social force for educating the masses and building the motherland.

The policy formulated by the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Trade Unions is completely correct. Under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the people's government, we have achieved great success by adhering to this policy. Of course, there are still shortcomings and errors in our work, and these shortcomings and errors must be thoroughly exposed and overcome in the great rectification movement that is currently underway. We must cultivate our country's working class into a more united, organized, disciplined, and culturally and technically advanced fighting force; we must develop our trade unions into true educators of millions of people and builders of a new life.

II. Current Tasks of the Trade Unions

The successful completion of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy has laid a good foundation for the industrialization and modernization of Chinese socialism. Our task is to, on this basis, strive to develop industry, actively support agriculture, and concentrate our efforts on implementing the second Five-Year Plan, which is about to begin.

The basic construction scale of the second Five-Year Plan will be large, and the speed of production development will also be fast. The total industrial output value and basic construction investment of the second Five-Year Plan will both be about double that of the first Five-Year Plan. Agriculture, handicrafts, transportation, finance, trade, and cultural and educational undertakings will all develop accordingly.

The experience of the implementation process of the first Five-Year Plan shows that the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry is completely correct. On the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, the development of industry and agriculture must be carried out simultaneously. Because industry and agriculture influence and promote each other, the working class not only directly shoulders the great and arduous task of developing industry and building modern industry in our country but also shoulders a very important task in developing agriculture, implementing the Outline for Agricultural Development (Draft for Revision), and building modern agriculture in our country. We must produce more chemical fertilizers, agricultural machinery, water conservancy equipment, transportation tools, pesticides, medicines, and daily necessities for the peasants.

The working class of our country and the people of the nation must continue to be diligent and thrifty, strive for increased production, practice economy, and study hard to successfully carry out the tasks of the second Five-Year Plan. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Thrifty management... should be the guiding principle for all economic undertakings. Thrifty management of factories, thrifty management of stores, thrifty management of all state-owned and cooperative enterprises, thrifty management of all other undertakings, and everything should follow the principle of thrift." This is our guiding principle.

To implement the above guiding principle and complete our current and the entire second Five-Year Plan's great tasks, the working class must continuously improve itself in terms of ideology, politics, and professional skills. The trade unions must unite and educate the broad masses of workers to maximize the initiative and creativity of the working class. The nationwide rectification movement that is currently underway is the best method to arouse the socialist initiative and creativity of the masses.

Since the rectification movement, factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and schools nationwide have widely adopted the forms of big-character posters, discussion meetings, and debate meetings, and in a short period of time, have formed a high tide of speaking out, debating, and rectifying and reforming. In this movement, many erroneous ideas have been thoroughly criticized, and right and wrong have been distinguished. At the same time, many phenomena of bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism in our work have been fully exposed, and these shortcomings and errors are being overcome with the strength of the masses.

In the rectification movement in factories, mines, and enterprises, the broad masses of workers are engaged in heated discussions and debates on issues such as the socialist or capitalist road, the relationship between developing production and improving living standards, personal interests and national interests, democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline, and workers and peasants. This is a very profound self-education of the masses. Through this self-education, the socialist consciousness of the workers has shown unprecedented improvement.

In the work of factories, mines, and enterprises, there have been some problems that have not been properly solved for a long time; some problems often encounter difficulties in handling and have been pending for a long time. However, in the rectification movement, through presenting facts and reasoning, many of these problems have been properly solved or are being solved by unifying understanding.

Through the rectification movement, the style of leadership has been significantly improved, and the relationship between the leadership and the workers, between production workers and engineering and technical personnel and management personnel, and between old and new workers has been greatly improved, greatly strengthening the unity of the working class.

In the rectification movement, the political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers have reached an unprecedented height. Many factories, mines, and enterprises that started the rectification movement earlier and did it better have already seen a high tide of mass production. In these units, a large number of new advanced producers have emerged, and they, together with the broad masses of workers, have created outstanding production achievements, proposed a large number of rationalization suggestions, solved many key technical problems in production, rapidly improved labor productivity, and excellently completed the state plan.

In summary, after the rectification movement, a large number of enterprises have begun to show a new face.

The facts prove that the rectification movement is a good method for mobilizing the workers and the people of the nation to carry out the socialist revolution and socialist construction; it is a good method for the masses to conduct self-education and raise their level of consciousness; it is a good method for correctly handling contradictions among the people and strengthening unity among the people; it is a good method for improving enterprise management and promoting the development of production. This is a major development of the Party's mass line. We must take this method as a regular working method in the future. In this way, we can fully rely on the strength and wisdom of the masses to confidently guarantee the successful completion of the second Five-Year Plan.

The trade unions are a mass organization of the working class. For the trade unions, the most important thing is to earnestly implement the Party's mass line and maintain close ties with the masses. Therefore, the trade unions must actively participate in the rectification movement, assist the Party in carrying out the rectification movement to the end, and implement the rectification method in all activities of the trade unions.

The trade unions must seriously study and gradually handle the opinions and criticisms of the workers on the work of the trade unions and actively assist the administrative leadership in seriously studying and gradually handling the opinions and criticisms of the workers on the work of the administration.

III. Persist in Democratic Centralism and Broadly Mobilize Workers to Participate in Enterprise Management

The fundamental principle of socialist enterprise management in our country is democratic centralism. Our enterprises are under the unified management of the state, with unified planning, unified systems, and a unified leadership system. Within the enterprise, there are strict discipline and centralized command. These are necessary. However, this high degree of centralized management is built on the conscious foundation of the broad masses of workers. In our enterprises, the workers enjoy full democratic rights. This democratic right is particularly prominent in the rectification movement.

Our centralism is centralism based on democracy; our democracy is democracy under centralized guidance. Such democratic centralism can combine the experience and wisdom of the leadership with the experience and wisdom of the broad masses of workers, can make hundreds of thousands of people act under a unified will, give full play to labor enthusiasm and creativity, consciously abide by management systems, and maintain labor discipline. If there is only centralism and no democracy, it is not only impossible to achieve true centralism but will also cause the leadership to become detached from the masses and reality, foster bureaucratism, which is incompatible with the nature of socialist enterprises. On the other hand, if there is only democracy and no centralism, it will lead to an anarchic state, disperse the troops, relax morale, and harm socialist interests, which is also incompatible with the nature of socialist enterprises.

The management work of our enterprises has always followed this principle. In terms of specific experience, it has been developed and improved over several years.

In the early days of liberation, factory management committees and workers' representative congresses were established in state-owned enterprises; labor-management consultation committees and production and cost reduction committees were established in private enterprises; democratic management committees were established in joint state-private enterprises. These forms played a significant role in giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers at that time. The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, held in 1956, summarized the experience of enterprise management over the past few years and decided to implement a leadership system in enterprises that combines collective leadership with personal responsibility, with the Party committee as the core. After the Eighth National Congress of the Party, to more effectively implement the mass line and expand and improve democratic life in enterprises, based on past experience, it was decided to trial the system of workers' representative congresses under the leadership of the Party committee in enterprises. Based on the experience of this period, the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party further affirmed this system. The implementation of this system is a further development of the activation of democratic life in enterprises, the play of the supervisory role of the masses, and the attraction of the masses to participate in enterprise management. It will make the labor discipline and centralized command of enterprises have a more solid mass foundation.

Since the rectification movement, factories, mines, and enterprises have, through big-character posters, discussion meetings, and debate meetings, quickly created an unprecedented broad and profound democratic movement in a short period of time. In units that have boldly mobilized the masses to speak out, debate, and rectify and reform, the various contradictions within the enterprise can be thoroughly exposed; various problems can find the most appropriate solutions through collective wisdom; the shortcomings and errors in the leadership work of the enterprise and some erroneous views of the workers can be effectively corrected and solved through the extensive development of criticism and self-criticism. On such a basis of speaking out, we can create a political situation within the enterprise that is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, and both has a unified will and individual comfort, lively and active. This political situation is a basic condition for the rapid development of our socialist cause.

We must closely combine the rectification method with the system of workers' representative congresses. In this way, the workers' representative congresses can fully play their active role.

The workers' representative congress is an organization for workers to participate in enterprise management, supervise enterprise administration, and strengthen self-education among workers. It has clearer and broader democratic rights than the workers' representative congresses in the early days of liberation. The workers' representative congress not only has the right to listen to the director's work report, review the enterprise's production, financial, technical plans, and labor and wage plans, and make various suggestions but also has the right to review and discuss the expenditure of various funds related to the living and welfare of workers within the enterprise, and make resolutions under the condition of not violating the instructions and orders of higher authorities. When necessary, it can suggest to higher management authorities to change certain instructions and orders and remove certain enterprise leaders. However, it is not an autonomous organ of the enterprise. It must, under the unified planning and unified leadership of the state, and under the condition of not interfering with the director's exercise of the powers granted by the state, correctly exercise the above rights according to the principle of democratic centralism. Its task is to fully reflect and correctly concentrate the opinions and demands of the masses, help and supervise the enterprise administration to continuously improve the production management of the enterprise and the work related to the welfare of workers, fully carry out criticism and self-criticism, enhance the unity of all workers, and ensure the correct implementation of state plans, policies, and laws and regulations.

The preparation and convening of the workers' representative congress, and the supervision of the implementation of the resolutions of the workers' representative congress, are the responsibilities of the trade unions. The trade unions should actively take on these responsibilities and maintain close ties with the representatives of the workers' representative congress, regularly listen to the opinions of the representatives on various aspects of work, and promptly submit these opinions to the relevant parties for handling. The trade unions should educate and organize all workers to strive to implement the resolutions of the congress and report to the workers' representative congress on the situation of various work items undertaken by the trade unions during the recess, and listen to the criticism and opinions of the congress.

Here, one point should be mentioned: in the rectification movement, the trade union small groups have played a significant role. Many discussion meetings and debate meetings were conducted using the meetings of trade union small groups. The experience of the rectification movement once again proves that the trade union small group is the most important and regular place for workers to conduct self-education and is also a basic organization of the workers' representative congress.

In summary, the combination of unified leadership and the mass line is our democratic centralism. By adhering to such democratic centralism, we can closely connect the leadership with the masses, correctly handle the contradictions within the enterprise, strengthen the labor discipline of the workers, and better complete the state plan.

IV. Push the Socialist Competition to New Heights

Over the past few years, socialist competition has developed significantly and accumulated a lot of experience. The trade unions must seriously summarize these experiences and sustainably and continuously carry out the new high tide of production and construction that has emerged.

Socialist competition is a mass production competition and a mass savings competition; it is a mass production and savings movement of mutual learning, mutual assistance, making up for each other's shortcomings, and common progress; it is a mass production and savings movement in which advanced producers help backward producers to reach the advanced level, and backward producers strive to learn from advanced producers, and advanced producers strive to become more advanced.

The most important link in organizing socialist competition is to continuously handle the contradictions between the advanced and the backward. The gap between advanced enterprises and ordinary enterprises, and between advanced producers and ordinary producers, is very large, and the contradictions between the advanced and the backward are always present. As long as we can gradually raise ordinary enterprises and ordinary producers to the advanced level, we can greatly improve labor productivity. Comrade Liu Shaoqi, in his congratulatory message to the National Conference of Advanced Producers in 1956, pointed out: "The people are the creators of history. The history of human society, ultimately, is the history of production, the history of producers. Production is always in a state of development and change, and new production technologies are constantly replacing old production technologies. Therefore, in any era, in any production sector, there are always a few relatively advanced producers who use relatively advanced production technologies and create relatively advanced production quotas. Subsequently, more and more producers learn their technologies and reach their quotas, until finally, the production level that was originally a few advanced individuals becomes the production level of the whole society, and social production is improved." Under the socialist system, every advanced enterprise and advanced producer not only should maintain and improve their own advanced level but also should strive to help ordinary enterprises and ordinary producers to reach the advanced level. Every ordinary enterprise and ordinary producer should strive to learn from advanced enterprises and advanced producers and strive to raise their production level to the level of the advanced. Every production leader must adhere to the mass line in production work, strongly support advanced producers, and help ordinary producers. Only by closely combining production leaders, advanced producers, and ordinary producers, and continuously consolidating and expanding the ranks of advanced producers, can we accelerate the development of production.

To organize socialist competition, we must guide the masses to continuously improve technology, improve technology, learn, and master new technologies; we must guide the masses to continuously learn business, familiarize themselves with business, and be proficient in business; we must plan and lead the learning of advanced experience from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, summarize and popularize the advanced experience of our country; organize rationalization suggestions, carry out mass mutual teaching, mutual learning, and mutual assistance activities, and take various measures to strive to improve the technical level and business level of the broad masses of workers. Only in this way can we rapidly improve labor productivity and work efficiency. Simply increasing labor intensity, relying on overtime to rush production, or not taking effective measures to popularize advanced experience and improve the technical level and business level of workers, is impossible to make the competition develop sustainably and healthily.

To organize socialist competition, we must rely on old workers and give full play to their active role in production. We must educate new workers to learn from old workers and respect the opinions of old workers; at the same time, we must also educate old workers to cherish new workers, help new workers quickly familiarize themselves with production and master technology, and continuously improve themselves, so that new and old workers can unite and move forward together.

To organize socialist competition, we must actively give play to the role of engineering and technical personnel and staff and make them closely unite with the workers. The trade unions should organize engineering and technical personnel and staff to frequently go deep into the workshops, go deep into the masses, patiently listen to the opinions of the masses, promptly handle the rationalization suggestions of the masses, help the masses overcome production difficulties, and together with the masses study and solve the key problems in production. In socialist competition, we must overcome the tendency to not believe in the masses, not rely on the masses, and not pay attention to concentrating the experience and wisdom of the masses to improve management and increase production.

To organize socialist competition, we must combine material rewards with ideological and political education. In socialist competition, material rewards are needed, and it is wrong to not have material rewards, but it is more important to rely on the political consciousness of the masses. Detaching from ideological and political work and emphasizing material incentives one-sidedly will easily lead the masses to pay attention only to personal interests and not to national interests. On the other hand, emphasizing ideological and political work while neglecting necessary material rewards will not make the masses care about their labor achievements from a material interest perspective. Both are detrimental to production.

To organize socialist competition, we must adopt appropriate forms according to the development of production in each period and the practice of the masses. Many forms that have been adopted in the past have been effective, and some are still very effective now. Here, it is particularly worth mentioning the conference of advanced producers. The conference of advanced producers is a good form of summarizing and exchanging advanced experience, praising, encouraging, and improving advanced producers, and mobilizing advanced producers to lead ordinary producers to complete the production plan. The trade union organization should institutionalize and sustain the good conference of advanced producers. Various mass production activities are generally carried out through small groups, so doing a good job in small group work is very important at any time.

To organize socialist competition, we must take the completion and overfulfillment of the state plan as the goal. Enterprise leaders should explain the state plan to the workers and organize discussions to make the state plan understood by the broad masses and, as far as possible, absorb the opinions of the masses to modify and supplement the plan. In the process of completing the state plan, we should also continuously discover and solve the weak links in production, support the rationalization suggestions of the masses, and solve the key problems in production. Not paying attention to guiding the masses to discuss the state plan, not paying attention to concentrating the wisdom of the masses, not paying attention to studying and solving the key problems in production, and pursuing the form of competition in isolation from the state plan and the needs of production will inevitably lead to formalism.

All the above experiences are what should be adhered to and applied in the future in organizing socialist competition.

Socialist competition must implement the guiding principle of thrift in building the country, thrift in managing enterprises, and thrift in all undertakings, that is, the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical.

Under our socialist system, the accumulation of funds mainly relies on the diligence and thrift of the people of the nation. Wasting the construction funds of the state is wasting the blood and sweat of the people. Saving one cent more can increase the construction strength of the state by one cent. We must make every cent of the state's funds used for basic construction play its due role. The workers in the basic construction engineering departments should regard saving the use of state funds as an unshirkable responsibility and insist on the principle of thrift in all aspects. Thrift is glorious, and waste is shameful, which should become a new custom and new morality. To resolutely fight against all phenomena of wasting state funds should be the responsibility of every citizen, especially every worker.

All workers in the raw material production departments should think of all possible ways to produce more raw materials for the state, strive to meet the needs of state construction and people's lives. All workers in the processing departments should, on the premise of ensuring quality, think of all possible ways to save raw materials and reduce the consumption quota of raw materials. All workers in enterprise units should also assist the administration in striving to improve management and save the use of working capital and reduce costs. Every worker should fight against all phenomena of wasting state property and not cherishing state property.

The workers in the departments of agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, education and health, scientific research, surveying and design, and geological exploration should implement the principle of "less money, more work" and strive to save the expenditure of various undertakings and fight against any phenomena of wasting state manpower, financial resources, and material resources to ensure the smooth completion of the plans of each undertaking. The workers in all undertaking units should assist the administrative leadership in formulating the reasonable standards of personnel and quotas for each undertaking, overcome the phenomena of high personnel and quota standards, seriously clean up and fully utilize the existing inventory materials and equipment. All undertaking units with the task of financial income as stipulated by the state should actively organize income according to the regulations of higher authorities. The method of not collecting what should be collected and requiring the state to increase subsidies is wrong.

In the past few years, the quality of many of our construction projects and industrial products has been continuously improving, and the variety of products has been continuously increasing, but some construction projects and industrial products are not like this. Not paying attention to improving quality and improving quality, producing substandard and defective products, is the greatest waste of state property. Not paying attention to increasing varieties will not be able to meet the needs of state construction and people's lives, affecting the speed of state construction and the improvement of people's lives. All workers should actively think of ways to improve product quality, increase product varieties, and ensure project quality.

Comrade Mao Zedong has long said: "While achieving increased production and savings, we must pay attention to the safety, health, and indispensable welfare of the workers; if we only pay attention to the former and neglect or slightly neglect the latter, that is wrong." In the past few years, we have achieved significant results in implementing this instruction, and work-related injuries and equipment accidents have been reduced year by year. However, in some industrial departments and some enterprises, work-related injuries and equipment accidents are still not few, and occupational diseases are still quite serious. Therefore, in the process of completing the task of increased production and savings, we must pay special attention to doing a good job in safety and health work, and we must run through the entire process of socialist competition with the specific organizational work and ideological work related to safety and health. In this way, we can definitely reduce accidents, reduce occupational diseases, improve the health of workers, and ensure the smooth development of socialist competition.

The trade unions must seriously summarize these experiences and sustainably and continuously carry out the new high tide of production and construction that has emerged.

Socialist competition must implement the guiding principle of thrift in building the country, thrift in managing enterprises, and thrift in all undertakings, that is, the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical.

Under our socialist system, the accumulation of funds mainly relies on the diligence and thrift of the people of the nation.

Therefore, in the process of completing the task of increased production and savings, we must pay special attention to doing a good job in safety and health work, and we must run through the entire process of socialist competition with the specific organizational work and ideological work related to safety and health. In this way, we can definitely reduce accidents, reduce occupational diseases, improve the health of workers, and ensure the smooth development of socialist competition.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 1st.

In ensuring quality, ensuring safety, and practicing thrift, we must strive to improve labor productivity and accelerate the progress of engineering projects as much as possible. We aim to complete each engineering project ahead of schedule and put it into production. We must also strive to increase the quantity of products, producing more high-quality, affordable goods for the country. Focusing solely on quantity and speed while neglecting quality and economy, or focusing solely on quality while neglecting economy, will result in significant losses for construction and production. Conversely, focusing solely on quality and economy while neglecting quantity and speed will hinder the pace of national construction. Therefore, in socialist competition, we must fully implement the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical."

In summary, whether in existing enterprises, new enterprises, expanded enterprises, basic construction enterprises, or other production and service units, there is still great potential. The idea that all tricks have been found and all potential has been exhausted is wrong. In industrial and agricultural production, basic construction, transportation, finance, and trade, we must seriously implement the Party's policies of building the country through thrift, managing enterprises through thrift, and conducting all affairs through thrift. Based on the situation and experience of each sector, especially the experience of the rectification movement, we must rely on the enthusiasm of the masses inspired by this rectification movement to fully launch the socialist competition of increasing production and saving resources.

V. From a comprehensive perspective, gradually improve the living conditions of workers

Caring for the people's livelihood is always important. Officials who do not care about the people's hardships must be opposed. However, the improvement of workers' living conditions must be based on the development of production and the improvement of labor productivity. It can only be gradual and cannot be too much or too fast. Additionally, the increase in workers' wages and benefits should be lower than the increase in labor productivity. Only in this way can social reproduction and employment be continuously expanded.

When considering workers' wages and benefits, we must start from the perspective of the six hundred million people, from the perspective of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and from the perspective of developing social production. Any practice that hinders unity and production must be corrected.

Before 1952, there was a period when we emphasized the people's livelihood issues one-sidedly while neglecting production. After correcting this error, there was another period when we neglected the people's livelihood issues. In 1956, we seriously reviewed the error of neglecting the people's livelihood issues, assisted the government in implementing wage reforms, and concentrated on solving some of the people's livelihood problems. These measures were basically necessary and appropriate. However, there were also shortcomings. In wage reforms, the wages of apprentices, odd-job workers, ordinary workers, and other workers whose labor was closer to that of peasants were relatively high, which caused dissatisfaction among the peasants. Some young workers, compared to older workers, were promoted too quickly, which caused dissatisfaction among the older workers. In terms of living and welfare, the scope of subsidies for the hard-pressed was too wide, leading to the growth of an incorrect mentality of relying solely on the state in some workers; we did not do enough to organize the masses to solve some problems that the masses could solve themselves; and we did not integrate political and ideological education work well. Therefore, after the nationwide rectification debate, it is necessary to gradually improve and adjust labor wages and labor insurance benefits in a planned manner.

The recent regulations drafts issued by the State Council regarding workers' wages and benefits are beneficial to the people of the whole country and to the cause of socialism, which means they are beneficial to the working class. The living standards of workers should not be too far removed from those of peasants. We workers cannot only look at immediate and local interests; we must see the long-term and overall interests. We workers must support the State Council's measures.

The state spends a considerable amount each year on workers' living expenses, including labor insurance fees, medical and health fees, education and cultural fees, welfare fees, and enterprise reward funds. Generally, these funds have been used appropriately. However, due to the lack of consideration by the trade union leadership, there have been instances of waste and extravagance because they did not fully consult with the masses. The main problem now is how to use these funds more rationally, making every penny count, and doing as much as possible for the masses without increasing expenses. This requires the trade union to work with the enterprise administration to formulate welfare plans for each period. When formulating welfare plans, investigations and research should be conducted, the opinions of the masses should be listened to, and based on needs and possibilities, proposals should be made to the workers' congress for discussion and decision-making, placing the welfare work under the supervision of the masses, and effectively combating bureaucratism.

Organizing workers to solve some problems they can handle themselves is of great significance in improving workers' living conditions. The trade union must educate the workers and their families to be thrifty, frugal, and practice economy, increasing savings and planning their lives. The trade union must also organize workers and their families to foster a spirit of mutual aid and love, establishing and strengthening mutual aid savings societies; setting up nurseries and kindergartens, and under possible conditions, organizing workers' families to engage in poultry farming, pig farming, sewing, laundry, knitting, and vegetable gardening. These are good ways to save expenses, increase income, and improve workers' living conditions, and should be promoted.

When handling workers' living-related demands, the trade union must conduct investigations and research, analyze specific situations, and treat them differently, strengthening political and ideological education for workers. For workers' reasonable demands, we must provide support and help the administration solve them appropriately as soon as possible. For workers' unreasonable demands, or even if they are reasonable but cannot be met at the moment, we must educate workers to consider the overall interests, correctly understand the relationship between living standards and production. It must be understood that national interests are the common interests of the people of the whole country, and personal interests must serve national interests. All individualism that ignores national and collective interests while only considering personal interests is wrong, and the actual result will be harmful to one's own interests. Ignoring workers' demands and shirking responsibilities is wrong; blindly supporting workers' demands without analysis is also wrong. The trade union must link the resolution of workers' living problems with political and ideological education, using the correct handling of each problem to raise workers' socialist awareness.

The trade union must actively participate in the formulation and implementation of national policies and laws regarding labor wages, labor insurance, and benefits. Before these policies and laws are determined, the trade union must go deep among the masses, conduct investigations and research, discover problems, reflect the masses' emotions, thoughts, and demands, actively propose suggestions, and assist the Party and the state in better concentrating the opinions of the masses. After these policies and laws are determined, the trade union must actively propagate and explain them to the workers, guiding the masses to consciously implement them, and fighting against all phenomena that violate these policies and laws.

To better handle workers' living problems, the following specific issues must also be noted:

In recent years, the trade union has done a lot of work in the area of labor wages. However, there are still many problems in wage work, and some aspects of the wage system are not practical enough. The reward system also has some aspects that are not reasonable enough. In wage issues, both egalitarianism and excessive disparity must be opposed. At the same time, the actual living standards of the majority of the people in the country must be considered. Therefore, based on the overall actual situation, according to the principle of paying according to work, helping the government and enterprise administration to improve the wage system according to local conditions remains an important task of the trade union.

In recent years, the trade union and enterprise administration have carried out work to prevent diseases and injuries, significantly reducing the incidence of diseases among workers; organized workers and their families to rely on their own strength to solve many living problems; and established recreational homes, sanatoriums, clinics, workers' canteens, health canteens, nurseries, and lactation rooms, helping workers solve many living difficulties that they could not solve on their own. Establishing these institutions is necessary. However, there are still many shortcomings in these institutions, especially the existence of waste. The trade union should work with the enterprise administration to strengthen this aspect of work, adapt to local conditions, improve management, combat waste, and mobilize the staff of these service departments to implement the principle of serving production and serving the people, effectively running these institutions.

Regarding the housing problem for workers, during the first five-year plan period, the state has invested in the construction of eighty million square meters of housing. However, due to the rapid increase in the number of workers, housing is still tight. To ease the housing tension for workers, in addition to the state's planned construction according to its capabilities, the trade union should, in places with conditions, organize workers to adopt self-building or self-building with public assistance to build part of the housing. At present, special attention should be paid to helping workers' families who can settle in the countryside to return to the countryside as much as possible. Settling in the countryside not only reduces personal expenses and the burden on the city but also allows workers' families to participate in agricultural labor, increase income, and make it easier for children to find jobs. Our countryside is a socialist countryside with a broad future. Workers' families living in the countryside, as long as they have the ability to work, should actively participate in agricultural production and, together with the peasant brothers, strive to build a beautiful and happy new countryside.

Disease and too many children are important reasons for the difficulties in the lives of some workers, so family planning and health work are also important issues in improving workers' living conditions. The trade union must organize workers and their families to work hard on the patriotic health campaign, improve environmental hygiene. This not only prevents diseases, promotes the health of workers and their families, and ensures that workers can attend work regularly but also avoids increasing expenses due to illness, affecting family life. Planned childbearing is also an urgent need for workers and their families. The trade union must vigorously promote family planning and work with relevant departments to advance this work.

VI. Strengthen political, cultural, and technical education for workers, and organize workers' cultural and sports activities

Under the leadership of the Party, the Chinese working class has experienced two revolutions and several political movements, fully demonstrating its revolutionary qualities in this year's anti-rightist struggle and rectification movement, defending the socialist system and the Party's leadership. The ideological and organizational situation of the Chinese working class is basically good.

Among the current 120 million industrial workers, only 35% are old workers from before liberation. Among the 65% of new workers, more than half are from peasant, student, and urban poor backgrounds, and the vast majority are young, full of vitality, eager to learn, and easily accept new things. However, they have a relatively strong petty-bourgeois ideology. Among the new workers, about 3% are from former landlords, rich peasants, capitalists, old military and police, and vagrant elements, and their class exploitation consciousness and bad habits are quite serious.

Therefore, the trade union must, through the rectification movement and socialist education, raise the awareness and organizational level of the working class. For a small number of individuals from exploitative classes, thorough ideological remolding is necessary. For a very small number of anti-socialist elements, hooligans, delinquents, and those who seriously violate laws and discipline, resolute struggle is necessary, and they must be constantly reformed. Those who do not reform should be supported by the administration to be expelled, to purify the ranks of the working class.

The central content of socialist education, according to the instructions of the Party's Eighth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee, should be: "On the leading position and leading responsibility of the working class in the socialist revolution and construction, on the political tasks of the working masses under the dictatorship of the proletariat. To make the working masses understand: under the leadership of the Communist Party, they must continuously raise their awareness, strengthen organization and discipline, enhance internal class unity; they must carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle, maintain the noble quality of selflessness, work hard, be thrifty, and with their exemplary role, lead the people of the whole country to struggle for the completion of socialist construction."

The basic method of conducting socialist education is criticism and self-criticism. In addition, methods such as regular political reports on current affairs, organizing workers to recall and compare, holding revolutionary history lectures and revolutionary achievements exhibitions, and praising good people and good deeds while opposing bad people and bad deeds can be used to educate workers to inherit the revolutionary traditions of the working class and cultivate workers' communist morality.

When carrying out the above work, attention should be paid to the characteristics of female workers and workers' families.

Among the trade union members, there are educators, journalists, artists, scientists, and medical workers. They are indispensable forces in socialist construction. From an economic position, they are part of the working class, but from a social background and ideology, most of them still belong to the category of bourgeois intellectuals. Through various political movements, especially through the anti-rightist struggle, they have made different degrees of progress politically. Some have become leftists, supporting the socialist system; most are in an intermediate state, they can agree with or do not oppose socialism, but they have long been influenced by bourgeois ideology, and it will take a long time for them to truly become intellectuals of the working class. Transforming intellectuals from the old society and cultivating new intellectuals, building a team of intellectuals of the working class, is a serious task for our people.

To transform intellectuals from the old society and make them truly become intellectuals of the working class, the trade union should strengthen ideological and political work for engineering and technical personnel, strengthen the work of education, medical, and other trade unions, especially their grassroots work. The trade union should pay attention to continuing the system of combining mental and physical labor that has already begun, and better organize the cooperation between intellectuals and manual laborers. The trade union should also give necessary care to the working and living conditions of intellectuals.

While strengthening the political and ideological education of workers, we must also pay constant attention to organizing workers' cultural and technical learning, improving workers' cultural and technical level.

Improving workers' technical level mainly relies on mutual teaching and learning among the masses. At the same time, we should widely promote apprenticeship contracts, advanced experience schools, technical research associations, technical mutual aid contracts, and the performances of advanced producers. Young workers should respect old workers, learn from them humbly, and study hard to become skilled workers.

For workers of different trades, the trade union should assist the administration in setting up specialized and comprehensive part-time technical training classes, teaching technical theory, and exchanging technical operation experience. In places with better conditions, part-time technical schools should also be established to systematically teach technical knowledge and train a large number of workers who master technology.

The trade union should vigorously organize workers to study culture. Workers who are still illiterate or semi-illiterate should generally raise themselves to the level of primary or junior high school graduates within the next five years.

The work of part-time cultural and technical teachers should be respected, and the trade union should give them practical help and support. They themselves should love their work and work diligently for the workers.

The trade union should effectively run various cultural undertakings and actively organize workers' cultural activities. It should continue to improve and enrich the activities of trade union libraries and clubs, give full play to the role of film projection teams, improve the socialist ideological and artistic level of workers' part-time literary and artistic activities, overcome some unhealthy phenomena and wasteful practices that still exist in this area, and further strengthen leadership and improve work.

Mass sports should be promoted, and the phenomenon of championshipism should be overcome. The equipment needed for sports, except for a few centralized venues, should be as simple as possible, and as much as possible should be solved by the masses themselves.

VII. Strengthen trade union construction and maintain close ties with the masses

The trade union must continuously strengthen its ties with the broad masses of workers, which is the basic condition for doing all trade union work well. Only when the trade union truly connects with the masses, communicates with them, and is trusted by them, can it truly guide the masses forward and become a genuine school of communism.

The most important link in trade union construction is ideological construction and the continuous improvement of work style. Through rectification, the correct line of the Party's trade union movement must be firmly implemented, and all forms of revisionism in the trade union movement must be resolutely fought. Through rectification, the ties with the broad masses of workers must be strengthened, and bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism must be effectively overcome.

Since national liberation, there have been two major debates among trade union cadres regarding the fundamental principles of trade union work. The first was after the completion of the democratic revolution and the establishment of a people's democratic government led by the working class nationwide, the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions had different opinions on how to define the principles and tasks of trade union work. This was resolved during the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions from 1951 to 1953. The second was after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, when some comrades had doubts and wavered regarding the fundamental principles and tasks of trade union work during the construction period. This was resolved during the current rectification movement. The common issue in both debates was first, whether the trade union should accept the leadership of the Party; second, whether the trade union should take production as the center, and how to correctly handle the relationship between developing production and improving workers' living conditions. The facts have proven that as long as the correct line of the Party's leadership of the trade union movement is adhered to, the relationship between the trade union and all aspects will be relatively normal, and the masses can be united around the Party to advance victoriously. Conversely, if the leadership of the Party is abandoned, politics is abandoned, production is neglected, and living issues are emphasized one-sidedly; if unity is neglected and the contradictions between the trade union and the administration are emphasized one-sidedly, the relationship between the trade union and all aspects will be out of balance, and the trade union will fall into the quagmire of economism and syndicalism, inevitably alienating the masses.

Since the rectification movement, rightist elements of the bourgeoisie have also launched vicious attacks on the trade union, attempting to make the trade union deviate from the socialist direction and the leadership of the Communist Party. The absurd statements and reactionary attempts of the rightists have been resolutely repelled by the broad masses of workers and trade union cadres.

Our trade union work is progressing under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and various levels of Party committees, along the correct line. The relationship between the trade union organizations at all levels and the masses is basically good and trusted by the masses. However, the trade union still has serious phenomena of bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism in many aspects, which are detached from reality and the masses. During this rectification movement, the masses of workers have made many criticisms of the trade union, indicating that there are still serious shortcomings in the work of the trade union, including the work of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has many shortcomings in closely connecting with lower-level organizations and the masses of workers, in systematically checking work, conducting investigations and research, and summarizing experiences, etc. We should seriously study the criticisms and suggestions of the masses, resolutely improve our leadership work, and through this rectification movement, further strengthen our ties with the masses.

To improve leadership work and strengthen ties with the masses, we should appropriately reform the trade union cadre team. Most trade union cadres are active, enthusiastic, hardworking, and connected with the masses. However, our cadre team still has many weaknesses. Although many of our cadres have grown up from the ranks of workers and are familiar with production and connected with the masses, some of them have been away from production for a long time, do not pay attention to connecting with the masses, and have developed bureaucratic tendencies. Some cadres are transferred from other sectors, and although they have undergone revolutionary tempering and have more experience in mass work, they generally lack industrial production knowledge and a deep understanding of the living and ideological conditions of workers. Some cadres are directly from schools and lack production knowledge and the ideological feelings of the working class. Therefore, we must resolutely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, organize cadres to participate in physical labor. Only in this way can our cadres better enrich their production knowledge, temper their class consciousness, enhance their class feelings, overcome non-proletarian thinking, and cultivate a work style of closely connecting with the masses and proceeding from reality. This is an effective way to reform the style of cadres, improve the quality of cadres, and overcome bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism. It is impossible to imagine that a trade union cadre without production knowledge, who does not understand the living, ideological, and emotional conditions of workers, and lacks the language of the masses, can educate workers and lead them to engage in socialist construction.

In minority areas, attention should be paid to cultivating trade union cadres from minority backgrounds and strengthening national unity education.

Currently, the trade union leadership organizations have overlapping structures, are too large, have too many details, and have too many redundant personnel, which have become serious obstacles to work progress. Due to the different distribution and development of industry and the different work foundations in various regions, the organizational forms of the trade union do not need to be uniform nationwide and from top to bottom. Each region should, based on the actual situation, proceed from the convenience of connecting with the masses and deepening work, and realistically adjust the organizational forms of the trade union. The organizational forms of industrial trade unions in various local areas should be adapted to local conditions, and the division and establishment of industrial trade union organizations should not be completely the same from top to bottom. The division and adjustment of industrial trade unions in various provinces and cities should mainly be determined by the provincial and municipal trade union federations under the leadership of the provincial and municipal Party committees. The leadership organizations of the trade union at all levels should truly become lean and flexible, with fewer personnel and higher efficiency. Existing cadres should be largely transferred down or participate in physical labor or grassroots work. Financial management and business management powers should also be appropriately delegated to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of local trade unions and grassroots organizations. The trade union work in various local areas and enterprises should be carried out under the direct leadership of the local Party committees and enterprise Party committees. Of course, this does not mean that the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the National Committees of Industrial Trade Unions is not important or does not need to be strengthened. Rather, it is a requirement to delegate some things that should not be centrally managed, so that the leadership organizations can better concentrate their efforts on investigations and research and the summary of experiences, and seriously study and solve major problems in the trade union movement. Only in this way can the role of the trade union leadership organizations be better played.

The trade union work in counties and towns has done a lot of work and accumulated a lot of experience in recent years, but the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has not paid enough attention to this aspect of work. The workers in counties and towns are close to the countryside and most of them directly serve the countryside. Doing a good job for this part of the workers is of great significance for the development of agricultural production and the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. Especially after the Party Central Committee proposed the policy of "while giving priority to the development of heavy industry, developing industry and agriculture simultaneously," the work of county and town trade unions has become even more important. In the future, we should actively strengthen this aspect of work.

The leading cadres of the trade union should frequently visit the masses for inspections and work. The leadership organizations of the trade union at all levels should regularly report their work and finances to the masses and take responsibility for handling the letters and visits from the masses. The organizations of the trade union at all levels must pay attention to strengthening the life of grassroots groups, making the groups truly a place for workers to educate themselves through criticism and self-criticism.

Activists are the bridge connecting the trade union with the masses, and many of the trade union's work is realized through their efforts. Currently, among our 3.89 million activists, the vast majority are active, enthusiastic, full of vitality, hardworking, and have played a major role in various activities. However, there are still shortcomings in our work with activists. Among the activists, there are still some who, due to a lack of work methods or the existence of other practical difficulties, have not yet fully played their role. Therefore, caring for activists, training and cultivating activists, continuously consolidating and expanding the team of activists, improving their work abilities, and fully playing their role should be an important and ongoing task of the trade union.

VIII. Strengthen the unity of the international working class and consolidate world peace

The Communist Party of China has always taught us that we must strengthen the unity of the Chinese working class with the working class of the whole world, and we must unite all possible forces in the world. The great victory of our socialist revolution and socialist construction is inseparable from the help of the great Soviet Union and other brother countries, and it is inseparable from the support of the working class of the whole world, as well as from the just struggle of all peace-loving people in the world. We express our gratitude for their help and support, and we extend a warm welcome to the delegation of the World Federation of Trade Unions led by Comrade S. I. Yanan and friends from various countries participating in this conference.

Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other brother countries, and at the same time learning from the working class of all countries in the world, is of great significance for our socialist construction.

Since the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Trade Union, the friendly exchanges between our trade union and trade unions of various countries in the world have developed greatly. The Chinese Trade Union has received 301 trade union delegations from 60 countries, totaling 1,982 visitors; during the same period, the Chinese Trade Union has also sent 149 delegations totaling 900 people to visit 28 countries. Through these mutual visits and exchanges, the Chinese Trade Union has established close friendly relations with the trade unions of many countries in the world.

During this period, we have exchanged friendly delegations and advanced producer delegations with the trade unions of various socialist countries. These activities have not only played an active role in mutual learning, exchanging experiences, helping national construction, and consolidating and developing the friendship between the working people of socialist countries but also have great significance for the cause of international working-class unity.

During this period, the Chinese Trade Union has also, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference, established and strengthened friendly relations with the trade unions of various countries in the Asia-Africa region through mutual visits. The Chinese working class has always sympathized with and supported the anti-colonial and national independence struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

During this period, the friendly exchanges between the Chinese Trade Union and the trade unions of various capitalist countries have also developed to a considerable extent. The Chinese working class also cares for and supports the struggle of the peoples of capitalist countries to defend world peace, oppose aggressive wars, defend trade union rights, and oppose monopoly capital.

The trade unions of various countries, although their situations and political views are different, still have common demands, which are to defend world peace, oppose imperialism, oppose colonialism, oppose monopoly capital, defend trade union rights, and struggle for improved living conditions and demand friendly cooperation among the working class of the whole world. In the struggle to achieve the above common demands, the friendly and united relationship between the Chinese Trade Union and the trade unions of various countries is developing.

In the process of developing international trade union friendly unity, the Chinese Trade Union has encountered many difficulties and obstacles. We have, based on the principles of equality, voluntariness, mutual respect, seeking common ground while reserving differences, and friendly consultation, patiently conducted practical contacts and exchanges, repeatedly expressed our sincere desire for friendly unity, increased mutual understanding and respect through actual contacts, and sought unity and cooperation in common demands. The split of international trade union organizations and the isolation of exchanges between trade unions of various countries have indeed caused some doubts and misunderstandings. Sincere, friendly actual contacts will gradually eliminate many doubts and misunderstandings. Although some trade unions have different political views from us, they can still cooperate friendly under common demands. Therefore, we are convinced that the unity of the international trade union movement, which is desired by the broad masses of workers in various countries, will ultimately be realized.

Currently, the forces for world peace are continuously developing and growing. Recently, the conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties of twelve socialist countries held in Moscow, and the subsequent conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties of sixty-four countries held in Moscow, and the two declarations issued by these two conferences with great historical significance, have shown unprecedented unity in the world communist movement. The political and economic strength of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union is increasingly strong, the Soviet Union has successfully launched two artificial satellites, and scientific and technological achievements are astonishing, the balance of power between the two camps has reached a new turning point; the anti-colonial and national independence struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are unprecedentedly high, the struggle of the working class and all peace-loving peoples in capitalist countries to oppose the exploitation of monopoly capital, oppose war, and defend peace is developing; the contradictions between imperialists are expanding, and American imperialism is increasingly isolated. All these show that the forces of the new world have surpassed the forces of the old world, and the international situation is more favorable for the people of the whole world to strive for lasting peace and oppose aggressive wars. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Now it is not the case of the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind, but the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind." However, the policy of arms expansion and war preparation of the imperialist group led by American imperialism still threatens world peace. American imperialism is vilely carrying out subversive activities and armed provocations in the Middle East, attempting to use the threat of war to intimidate and strike the national independence movements of the Arab countries. The bloody massacres by British and French colonialists in Oman and Algeria are still intensifying. We must sympathize with and support Egypt, Syria, Oman, and other Arab countries, as well as Algeria, and other countries and peoples struggling for national independence and self-determination.

American imperialism is still continuing to occupy our territory of Taiwan, and we must struggle to consolidate national defense and liberate Taiwan.

American imperialism and its aggressive group, ignoring the just demands of the people of the world who love peace for the reduction of armaments, the cessation of the production and use of nuclear weapons, and the immediate cessation of nuclear weapon tests, are obstructing and sabotaging in various ways, and are unwilling to reach an agreement on the above issues. We must unite with the working class of the whole world and all peace-loving peoples to oppose the production, testing, and use of nuclear weapons, oppose war, and defend lasting world peace.

We must also continue to strengthen the unity between the countries of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, especially continue to consolidate and strengthen the great, unbreakable unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. The consolidation of the unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is a strong bastion for defending world peace.

Our Party and country's foreign policy is completely in line with the interests of the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country. We firmly support the Party and country's foreign policy.

The Chinese Trade Union is willing to continue to work hard in the international trade union movement to fulfill its due responsibilities. We will, based on the spirit of the resolutions adopted by the Fourth World Trade Union Congress, continue to strengthen and develop the friendship and ties between the Chinese Trade Union and the trade unions of various countries in the world, and promote the unity of the international trade union movement.

Comrades! The Chinese working class must be vigilant and work hard, with their exemplary actions, unite the people of the whole country, unite all possible forces at home and abroad, strive hard, and build the country through thrift. We believe that the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other brother countries, and with the support of the working class of the whole world and all peace-loving peoples, will definitely be able to build our country into a great, prosperous, and strong socialist country!

Long live the great People's Republic of China!

Long live the Chinese working class!

Long live the great unity of the people of the whole country led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live the great unity of the working class of the whole world!

Long live peace!

    团结全国人民，勤劳节俭，建设社会主义的新中国！
    ——中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会向第八次全国代表大会的工作报告——
    赖若愚同志们！
    我受第七届执行委员会的委托，向大会作工会工作报告，请大会予以审查。
      一、四年来工会工作概况
    自从1953年中国工会第七次全国代表大会以来，已经有四年多了。在这四年多的时间里，我国社会经历了具有历史意义的伟大变革。中国工人阶级和全国人民在中国共产党的领导下，取得了社会主义革命的基本胜利。1956年我国的农业和手工业实现了合作化，资本主义工商业实现了公私合营，在经济战线上取得了社会主义革命的基本胜利；1957年粉碎了资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻；同时，在全民中进行整风运动，从而在政治战线和思想战线上取得了社会主义革命的新胜利。我国几千年来的阶级剥削制度的历史，从此宣告基本结束。
    在这四年多的时间里，我国的社会主义建设有了辉煌的成就。从1953年开始的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的基本任务和主要指标，现在已经完成或超额完成。第一个五年计划的工业总产值已经在去年完成了计划指标的109.5％，1957年的工业总产值将要达到1952年的230％。作为第一个五年计划中心的工业基本建设，按投资额计算，五年合计将完成计划的106％以上。农业生产虽然遭受了1954年和1956年两次严重的自然灾害，但是以粮食总产量来说，1956年已经达到第一个五年计划规定的1957年的水平。交通运输、金融贸易、文化教育事业也相应地有了很大的发展。在国民经济巨大发展的基础上，我国职工和全体劳动人民的物质生活和文化生活也有了相应的改善。
    在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，中国工人阶级站在斗争的最前列。它在自己伟大的先锋队——中国共产党的领导下，同全国人民一起，进行了英勇的斗争，表现了无限的勇敢和勤劳，贡献了自己的智慧和力量。
    事实证明：中国工人阶级同全国人民一起，完全能够战胜前进道路上的一切障碍和困难，完全能够把社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业担当起来，并且必然取得彻底的胜利。资产阶级右派企图推翻工人阶级的领导、推翻社会主义制度的阴谋已经失败了；任何反动势力企图把中国人民拖回到被奴役、被剥削的老路上去的阴谋，都是注定要失败的。
    做为工人阶级群众性组织的工会，过去几年中间，在党的领导下，对职工群众进行了巨大的思想工作和组织工作，提高了职工群众的觉悟程度和组织程度。工会在社会主义改造和社会主义建设中发挥了重大的作用。
    中国工会第七次全国代表大会根据党在过渡时期的总路线，规定了建设时期工会工作的方针，这个方针就是：“在中国共产党的领导下，联系并教育工人群众，不断地提高工人群众的觉悟程度和组织程度，巩固工农联盟，团结各阶层人民，积极地完成国家建设计划，并在发展生产的基础上，逐步地改善工人阶级和全体劳动人民的物质生活与文化生活，为逐步实现国家的工业化与过渡到社会主义社会而斗争。”
    四年以来，工会正是遵照着这个方针来进行工作的。
    为了完成并争取超额完成发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，工会动员职工群众广泛而深入地开展了社会主义竞赛。1953年，在工会干部中间，进行了面向生产的思想教育，加强了竞赛的领导。1954年和1955年，开展了以提高技术、改进技术、学习和掌握新技术为中心内容的社会主义竞赛，使总结和推广先进经验、组织合理化建议的工作有了很大的发展。1956年，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的高潮中，为了响应党中央提出的又多、又快、又好、又省地进行社会主义建设的号召，在全国范围内开展了规模空前的先进生产者运动，发扬了职工群众的集体主义精神，推动了竞赛的前进。四年来，在全国职工群众中涌现出二百六十万先进生产者，提出了四百五十六万件合理化建议，推广了成千成万的先进经验，大大地提高了劳动生产率。
    在私营企业中，工会根据党对资本主义工商业利用、限制和改造的政策，发动职工群众实行了全面的监督。1955年下半年到1956年上半年，随着我国农业合作化和手工业合作化高潮的到来，工会广泛地发动了群众，协助政府推动资本家接受了公私合营的方针，帮助公股代表清点资产、核定资金、安排人员、改组经济，保证了资本主义工商业社会主义改造的顺利完成，使合营企业的生产得到了迅速的发展。
    工会向职工群众进行了共产主义教育。1953年和1954年，在全国范围内大张旗鼓地进行了党在过渡时期总路线的教育和巩固劳动纪律的教育；1955年，通过肃反运动进行了肃反政策和巩固无产阶级专政的教育；1956年，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的高潮中，进行了社会主义革命和又多、又快、又好、又省地建设社会主义的教育；在今年的整风运动和反击资产阶级右派的斗争中，在更大范围和更深刻的程度上，向广大职工群众进行了并且进行着反对资本主义道路的社会主义教育，以及增产节约、勤俭建国的教育。在组织职工群众进行文化技术学习方面，工会组织也做了许多工作。目前参加业余文化学习的职工共有五百多万人，参加技术学习和科学知识讲座的为数更多。这些，对于提高职工群众的社会主义觉悟和文化技术水平，都产生了良好的效果。工会在改善职工群众的物质生活和文化生活方面，也做了巨大的努力。几年来工会协助政府贯彻执行了党和国家的劳动工资政策，改革了工资制度，提高了工资标准。职工的工资水平1956年比1952年提高了37％。工资总基金1952年是六十七亿元，预计1957年将达到一百四十八亿元、比1952年增长了一倍多。随着生产的发展，职工的队伍迅速扩大。八年来，国家解决了一千三百万人的就业问题，平均每年增加就业人数一百六十多万。旧中国遗留下来的近四百万失业人员，已经基本上得到了安置。在劳动保护工作方面，工会协助和监督企业行政改善了劳动条件，加强了安全生产工作。五年内国家用于劳动保护的拨款共有二亿九千万元。劳动保险和公费医疗的实施范围不断扩大，解除了广大职工生、老、病、死、伤、残的困难。预计第一个五年计划期间，国家机关、企业、事业单位支出的附加工资和各项福利费用共计九十六亿元，为工资总额的19.2％，如果加上国家用于社会的文教，卫生和社会福利等经费中职工享受的部分，就达到工资总额的25％以上。工会举办的疗养院的床位已达两万五千多张，基层单位的托儿所和哺乳室已达八千二百个。此外，还依靠职工和职工家属自己的力量，在职工住宅区举办了一千七百七十四个托儿站和幼儿园。五年来，国家投资建筑的职工住宅共八千万平方公尺。职工群众的业余文化艺术和体育活动，也有了很大的发展。这同解放前职工所过的饥寒交迫的生活比较起来，简直有天壤之别。
    工会的组织建设这几年来也有了很大的进步。目前我们已经有一千六百三十多万会员，三百八十九万积极分子。在群众生产、劳动工资、劳动保护、劳动保险、生活福利、文化教育、体育运动、女工家属、工会财务等方面，都积累了许多工作经验。通过各种活动和各种事业，工会同广大职工群众建立了密切的联系，成为教育群众、建设祖国的坚强的社会力量。
    中国工会第七次全国代表大会所规定的方针是完全正确的。我们遵循着这一方针，在党的领导下，在人民政府的支持下，已经取得了巨大的成就。当然，在我们工作中还是存在着缺点和错误的，这些缺点和错误都要在当前正在进行着的伟大的整风运动中，从各个方面彻底地予以揭露和克服。我们必须把我国的工人阶级队伍培养成为一个有觉悟、有组织、有纪律、有文化技术的更加坚强的战斗队伍；把我国工会造就成为真正的千百万人的教育者，新生活的建设者。
      二、工会的当前任务
    发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的胜利完成，已经给我国社会主义工业化和农业现代化打下了良好的初步基础。我们的任务就是要在这个基础上，努力发展工业，积极支援农业，集中力量来执行即将开始的第二个五年计划。
    第二个五年计划的基本建设规模将是大的，生产发展的速度也将是快的。第二个五年计划的工业总产值和基本建设投资额，都比第一个五年计划增长一倍左右。农业、手工业、交通运输业、金融、贸易以及文教事业，都要有相应的发展。
    第一个五年计划执行过程的经验说明，优先发展重工业的方针是完全正确的。在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业和发展农业必须同时并举。因为工业和农业是相互影响、相互促进的。因此，工人阶级不仅在发展工业、建设我国现代工业方面直接肩负着伟大而艰巨的任务，而且在发展农业、实现农业发展纲要（修正草案）、建设我国现代农业方面也肩负着极重大的任务。我们必须为农民生产更多的化学肥料、农业机械、水利设备、运输工具、杀虫药剂、医药用品和生活资料。
    我国工人阶级和全国人民，必须继续克勤克俭、努力增产、厉行节约、刻苦学习，才能顺利地执行第二个五年计划的任务。毛泽东同志说：“勤俭经营……应当是一切经济事业的方针。勤俭办工厂，勤俭办商店，勤俭办一切国营事业和合作事业，勤俭办一切其它事业，什么事情都应当执行勤俭的原则。”这就是我们的方针。
    为了贯彻执行上述方针来完成我们当前和整个第二个五年计划的伟大任务，工人阶级必须从思想上、政治上、业务能力上不断地提高自己。工会必须团结和教育广大职工群众，最大限度地发挥工人阶级的积极性和创造性。目前正在开展着的全民性的整风运动，就是激发群众的社会主义积极性和创造才能的最好的方法。
    整风运动以来，全国厂矿企业、机关、学校，普遍地采用了大字报、座谈会、辩论会等形式，在很短的时间内，就形成了大鸣大放、大争大辩和大整大改的高潮。在这个运动中，彻底地批判了许多错误思想，分清了大是大非，同时也充分揭露了我们工作中存在着的许多官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义现象，并且依靠群众的力量正在克服着这些缺点和错误。
    在厂矿企业的整风运动中，广大职工对于社会主义或者资本主义两条道路的问题，对于有关发展生产与改善生活、个人利益与国家利益、民主与集中、自由与纪律、工人与农民等等关系问题，正在进行着热烈的讨论和辩论。这是一种极为深刻的群众性的自我教育。经过这种自我教育，职工的社会主义觉悟表现出空前的提高。
    在厂矿企业的工作中，有一些问题长期没有得到适当的解决；有些问题往往在处理上发生困难，因而积压很久。可是在整风运动中，经过摆事实、讲道理，对许多这样的问题，统一了认识，使这些问题得到了适当的解决，或者正在解决。
    经过整风运动，领导作风已有显著的改善，在领导人员同工人群众之间，在生产工人同工程技术人员、管理人员之间，以及新老工人之间的关系都有了很大的改善，大大地加强了工人阶级的团结。
    在整风运动中，广大职工的政治热情和劳动热情，空前高涨。许多整风运动开始较早、进行较好的厂矿企业，已经出现了群众性的生产高潮。在这些单位，涌现出大批新的先进生产者，他们和广大职工群众创造了优异的生产成绩，提出了大量的合理化建议，解决了许多生产技术上的关键问题，迅速地提高了劳动生产率，出色地完成了国家计划。
    总之，经过整风运动，大量的企业开始出现了崭新的面貌。
    事实证明，整风运动是动员职工群众和全国广大人民进行社会主义革命和进行社会主义建设的好方法；是群众进行自我教育，提高觉悟程度的好方法；是正确处理人民内部矛盾，加强人民团结的好方法；是改善企业管理，促进生产发展的好方法。这是党的群众路线的一个重大发展。我们必须把这种方法，做为今后经常的工作方法。这样，我们就可以充分依靠群众的力量和智慧，有把握地保证第二个五年计划的胜利完成。
    工会是工人阶级的群众组织。对工会来说，最重要的问题就是认真地贯彻执行党的群众路线，密切地联系群众。因此，工会必须积极地参加整风运动，协助党把整风运动进行到底，并且把整风的方法贯彻到工会工作的各种活动中去。
    工会必须认真研究和逐步处理职工群众对工会工作的意见和批评，积极协助行政领导认真研究和逐步处理职工群众对行政工作的意见和批评。
    三、坚持民主集中制，广泛地吸引职工群众参加企业管理
    我国社会主义企业管理工作的根本原则是民主集中制。我们的企业是在国家的统一管理之下的，它有统一的计划、统一的制度、统一的领导系统。在企业内部，有严格的纪律和集中的指挥。这些都是必需的。可是这种高度的集中管理是建筑在广大职工自觉的基础之上的。在我们的企业里，职工群众享有充分的民主权利。这种民主权利，在整风运动中突出地表现出来了。
    我们的集中是民主基础上的集中；我们的民主是集中指导下的民主。这样的民主集中，才能使领导的经验和智慧同广大职工群众的经验和智慧结合起来，才能使千百万人在统一的意志下行动起来，发挥劳动积极性和创造性，自觉地遵守管理制度，维护劳动纪律。只要集中，不要民主，不仅不能达到真正的集中，而且会使领导脱离群众，脱离实际，滋长官僚主义，那是同社会主义企业的性质不相容的。反之，只要民主，不要集中，就会形成无政府状态，就会涣散队伍，松懈斗志，损害社会主义的利益，这也是同社会主义企业的性质不相容的。
    我国企业的管理工作，一直是遵循着这个原则的。而在具体经验方面，则是经过几年的发展，日益完善起来的。
    解放初期，在国营企业里，曾经建立过工厂管理委员会和职工代表会议；在私营企业里，曾经建立过劳资协商会议和增产节约委员会；在公私合营企业里，曾经建立过民主管理委员会。这些形式，在当时对发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性，都起了重大的作用。1956年中国共产党第八次全国代表大会，总结了几年来企业管理的经验，确定了在企业中实行以党委为核心的集体领导和个人负责相结合的领导制度。党的八次代表大会以后，为了更加切实地贯彻执行群众路线，扩大和健全企业的民主生活，根据过去的经验，确定在企业中试行党委领导下的职工代表大会制度。根据这一时期的试点经验，党的八届三中全会上更肯定了这一制度。这一制度的推行，是活跃企业中的民主生活、发挥群众监督作用，吸引群众参加企业管理的进一步发展，它将会使企业的劳动纪律和集中指挥有更加巩固的群众基础。
    整风以来，厂矿企业经过出大字报，开座谈会和辩论会，大鸣大放大争，摆事实，讲道理，在一个短时间内，迅速地造成了空前广泛而深刻的民主运动。凡是放手发动群众大鸣大放大争大改的单位，企业的各种矛盾就能够得到彻底的揭露；各种问题由于集思广益，就能够找到最妥当的解决办法；企业领导工作中的缺点和错误以及职工群众的某些错误观点，由于批评和自我批评的广泛开展，也就能够有效地加以纠正和解决。在这样一个大鸣大放的基础上，我们就有可能在企业内部造成一种“又有集中又有民主的，又有纪律又有自由的，又有统一意志、又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的政治局面”。这种政治局面，正是促进我国社会主义事业迅速发展的一个基本条件。
    我们必须把整风方法同职工代表大会制度紧密结合起来。这样，职工代表大会才能够充分发挥它的积极作用。
    职工代表大会是职工群众参加企业管理、监督企业行政、加强职工自我教育的组织。它较之解放初期的职工代表会议具有更明确更广泛的民主权利。职工代表大会不仅有权利听取厂长的工作报告，审查企业的生产、财务、技术计划和劳动工资计划，提出各项建议，而且有权利审查和讨论企业内部有关职工生活福利各项经费的开支，在不违反上级机关的指示、命令的条件下作出决议。在必要的时候，它可以向上级管理机关建议改变某些指示、命令和撤换某些企业领导人员。可是，它并不是企业的自治机关，它必须在国家的统一计划和统一领导下，在不妨碍厂长行使国家赋予他的职权的条件下，按照民主集中制的原则来正确地行使上述的权利。它的任务是充分反映和正确集中群众的意见和要求，帮助并且监督企业行政不断地改善企业生产管理和有关职工福利的工作，充分开展批评和自我批评，增强全体职工的团结，以保证国家计划和政策、法令的正确执行。
    准备和召集职工代表大会，监督职工代表大会决议的贯彻执行，都是工会的责任。工会应当积极地把这些责任担当起来，并且密切联系职工代表大会的代表，经常听取代表们对各方面工作的意见，把这些意见及时地提交有关方面加以处理。工会应当教育和组织全体职工努力实现大会的决议，并且向职工代表大会报告关于闭会期间由工会负责进行的各项工作的情况，听取大会的批评和意见。
    在这里，有一点应当提到：在整风运动中，工会小组发挥了很大作用。许多座谈会和辩论会，是运用工会小组会进行的。整风运动的经验又一次证明，工会小组是职工进行自我教育的最重要最经常的场所，也是职工代表大会的一个基础组织。
    总之，统一领导和群众路线相结合，就是我们的民主集中制，坚持这样的民主集中制，就能够密切领导同群众的联系，正确地处理企业内部的矛盾，加强职工群众的劳动纪律，更好地完成国家计划。
    四、把社会主义竞赛推向新的高涨
    几年以来，社会主义竞赛有了很大发展，积累了很多经验，工会必须认真地总结这些经验，把目前出现的生产建设新高潮巩固而持久地开展起来。
    社会主义竞赛是群众性的增产竞赛和节约竞赛；是互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短、共同提高的群众性的增产节约运动；是组织先进者帮助落后者达到先进水平，落后者努力向先进者学习，先进者争取更加先进的群众性的增产节约运动。
    组织社会主义竞赛的最重要的环节，就是不断地处理先进同落后的矛盾。先进企业同普通企业、先进生产者同普通生产者的距离是很大的，先进同落后的矛盾是经常存在的。只要我们善于把普通企业和普通生产者逐步地提高到先进水平，就可以大大地提高劳动生产率。刘少奇同志在1956年对全国先进生产者代表会议的祝词中指出：“人民群众是历史的创造者。人类社会的历史，归根结底，是生产的历史，是生产者的历史。生产是永远处在发展变动的状态中的，新的生产技术不断地代替着旧的生产技术。因此，在任何时代，在任何生产部门中，总是有少数比较先进的生产者，他们采用着比较先进的生产技术，创造着比较先进的生产定额。随后，就有愈来愈多的生产者学会了他们的技术，达到了他们的定额，直至最后，原来是少数先进分子的生产水平就成为全社会的生产水平，社会生产就提高了。”在社会主义制度下，每一个先进企业和先进生产者，不但应当保持和提高自己的先进水平，而且要努力帮助普通企业、普通生产者也能够达到先进的水平。每一个普通企业、普通生产者都应当努力向先进企业学习、向先进生产者学习，努力把自己的生产水平提高到先进者的水平。每一个生产领导者都必须坚持生产工作中的群众路线，大力支持先进生产者，帮助普通生产者。只有使生产领导者、先进生产者和普通生产者紧密地结合起来，不断地巩固和扩大先进生产者的队伍，才能够加速生产的发展。
    组织社会主义竞赛，必须引导群众不断地提高技术、改进技术、学习和掌握新技术；必须引导群众不断地学习业务、熟悉业务、精通业务；必须有计划地、有领导地学习苏联及其他兄弟国家的先进经验，总结和推广我国的先进经验；组织合理化建议，开展群众性的互教、互学、互助运动，采取各种办法努力提高广大职工群众的技术水平和业务水平。只有这样，才能迅速地提高劳动生产率和工作效率。单纯地提高劳动强度，依靠加班加点突击生产，或者不采取有效措施推广先进经验和提高职工的技术水平、业务水平，是不可能使竞赛持久而健康地发展下去的。
    组织社会主义竞赛，必须依靠老工人，充分发挥他们在生产中的积极作用。我们必须教育新工人向老工人学习，尊重老工人的意见；同时也必须教育老工人爱护新工人，帮助新工人迅速地熟悉生产、掌握技术，并且不断提高自己，使新老工人团结一致，共同前进。
    组织社会主义竞赛，必须积极地发挥工程技术人员和职员的作用，并且使他们同工人紧密地团结起来。工会应当组织工程技术人员和职员经常地深入车间，深入群众，耐心地听取群众意见，及时地处理群众的合理化建议，帮助群众克服生产上的困难，同群众一起研究和解决生产中的关键问题。在社会主义竞赛中，必须克服那种不相信群众，不依靠群众，不注意集中群众的经验和智慧去改善管理、提高生产的倾向。
    组织社会主义竞赛，必须把物质奖励同思想政治教育结合起来。在社会主义竞赛中，物质奖励是需要的，不要物质奖励是不对的，但是更重要的是依靠群众的政治觉悟。脱离思想政治工作，片面地强调物质刺激，就容易引导群众只注意个人利益而不很注意国家利益。反之，只强调思想政治工作而忽视必要的物质奖励，就不能使群众从物质利益上关心自己的劳动成果。二者都是对生产不利的。
    组织社会主义竞赛，必须根据各个时期生产的发展，根据群众的实践，采取恰当的形式。过去所采取过的许多形式，都是起了作用的，有些现在还是很有作用的。在这里，特别值得指出的是先进生产者会议。先进生产者会议是总结和交流先进经验，表扬、鼓励和提高先进生产者，以及动员先进生产者带动普通生产者完成生产计划的一种很好的形式。工会组织应当把开好先进生产者会议形成制度，坚持下去。各种群众生产活动一般是通过小组去进行的，因此，作好小组工作，不论什么时候，都是十分重要的。
    组织社会主义竞赛，必须以完成和超额完成国家计划为目标。企业领导者应当把国家计划向职工群众作必要的交代，并且组织讨论，使国家计划为广大群众所了解，并尽量吸收群众意见，修改和补充计划。在完成国家计划的过程中，还应当不断地发现和解决生产中的薄弱环节，支持群众的合理化建议，解决生产中的关键问题。不重视引导群众讨论国家计划，不重视集中群众的智慧，不注意研究和解决生产中的关键问题，脱离国家计划和生产的需要，孤立地追求竞赛的形式，就必然会发展形式主义。
    所有以上这些经验，都是今后在组织社会主义竞赛中应当坚持和运用的。
    社会主义竞赛必须贯彻执行勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业的方针，即又多、又快、又好、又省的方针。
    在我们的社会主义制度下，资金的积累主要依靠全国人民的勤劳节俭。浪费国家的建设资金，就是浪费人民的血汗。多节约一分钱，就可以为国家多增加一分建设力量。我们要使国家用于基本建设的每一分钱，都发挥它应有的作用。基本建设施工部门的职工，都应当把节约使用国家资金作为义不容辞的责任，在一切方面坚持节约的原则。节约光荣，浪费可耻，应当成为一种新风气、新道德。向一切浪费国家资金的现象作坚决的斗争，应当是每一个公民特别是每一个职工的责任。
    一切原材料生产部门的职工，应当想尽一切办法为国家生产更多的原材料，努力满足国家建设和人民生活的需要。一切加工部门的职工，在保证质量的前提下，应当想尽一切办法节约原材料，降低原材料的消耗定额。一切企业单位的职工还应当协助行政努力改善经营管理，节约使用流动资金、降低成本。每一个职工都应当向一切浪费国家资财、不爱护国家资财的现象作斗争。
    农林、水利、文教卫生、科学研究以及勘测设计、地质勘探等事业单位的职工，都应当贯彻执行“少花钱、多办事”的原则，努力节约各项事业费用的开支，同任何浪费国家人力、财力和物力的现象作斗争，以保证各该项事业计划的顺利完成。一切事业单位的职工都应当协助行政领导制定各该事业的合理的定员定额标准，克服那些定员定额标准偏高的浪费现象，认真清理和充分利用现有的库存材料和设备。凡是国家规定有财政收入任务的事业单位，这些单位的职工还应当协助行政领导按照上级规定积极组织收入。应收不收，而要求国家增加拨款补助的办法，是错误的。
    过去几年，我们的许多建设工程和工业产品的质量是在不断地提高着，产品品种也在不断地增加着，可是还有一些建设工程和工业产品并不如此。不注意提高质量，改进质量，出现次品和废品，这就是对国家财产的最大浪费。不注意增加品种，就不能满足国家建设和人民生活的需要，就会影响国家的建设速度，影响人民生活的改善。所有职工都应当积极地想办法，为提高产品质量、增加产品品种和保证工程质量而努力。
    毛泽东同志早就说过：“在实现增产节约的同时，必须注意职工的安全、健康和必不可少的福利事业；如果只注意前一方面，忘记或稍加忽视后一方面，那是错误的。”过去几年，我们在执行这个指示中，已经获得重大成就，工伤事故、设备事故已经逐年有所降低。可是在某些工业部门和某些企业中，工伤事故和设备事故仍然不少，职业病仍然相当严重。因此，在实现增产节约任务的过程中，必须十分注意搞好安全卫生工作，必须把有关安全卫生的具体组织工作、思想工作贯串到整个社会主义竞赛的全部过程中去。这样，就一定可以减少事故，减少职业病，增进职工的健康，保证社会主义竞赛的顺利发展。
    在保证质量、保证安全、厉行节约的基础上，必须努力提高劳动生产率，尽可能地加快工程进度，争取每一个工程项目提前竣工和投入生产；尽可能地提高产品数量，为国家制造出更多的物美价廉的产品。只注意多和快，而忽视好和省，或者只注意好，而忽视省，就会给建设和生产带来巨大的损失。相反的，只注意好和省，而忽视多和快，就会影响国家的建设速度。所以在社会主义竞赛中，必须全面地贯彻又多、又快、又好、又省的方针。
    总之，不论原有企业、新建企业、改建扩建企业、基本建设企业以及其他生产、事业单位，都有很大的潜力，那种认为窍门找绝、潜力挖光的思想是错误的。工农业生产方面、基本建设方面、交通运输业方面、金融贸易方面，都应当认真贯彻执行党的勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业的方针，根据各自的情况和经验、特别是整风运动的经验，依靠这次整风运动所鼓舞起来的群众积极性，把增产约节的社会主义竞赛全面地开展起来。
      五、从全局出发，逐步改善职工生活
    关心群众生活在任何时候都是重要的。不关心群众疾苦的官僚主义，是必须反对的。但是，职工生活的改善，必须建立在发展生产、提高劳动生产率的基础上，只能是逐步的，不能太多太快。并且职工工资福利的提高，应当低于劳动生产率的提高。只有这样，才能不断地扩大社会再生产，扩大社会就业。
    当我们考虑职工工资福利的时候，必须从六亿人口出发，从巩固工农联盟出发，从发展社会生产出发。一切有碍团结、有碍生产的做法都是必须纠正的。
    1952年以前，我们曾经有一个时期，片面地强调了群众的生活问题，而放松了生产。在纠正了这种错误之后的某一个时期内，又忽视了生活问题。在1956年，我们认真地检讨了忽视群众生活问题的错误，协助政府进行了工资改革，比较集中地解决了一些群众生活上的问题。这些，基本上都是必要的、适当的。但是缺点也是有的。在工资改革方面，学徒工、勤杂工、普通工以及其他和农民劳动比较接近的工人，工资比较高了一点，农民是有意见的；一部分青年工人同老工人比较，升级快了一点，老工人是有意见的。在生活福利方面，困难补助的面宽了一些，以致在某些工人中滋长了单纯依赖国家的不正确思想；我们对于组织群众自己的力量解决一些群众自己可能解决的问题做得很不够；同政治思想教育工作结合得也很差。因此，经过全民整风大辩论之后，对劳动工资、劳保福利有计划地、逐步地进行一些改善和调整是必要的。
    国务院最近公布的有关职工工资福利的几个规定草案，都是对全国人民有利、对社会主义事业有利的，也就是对工人阶级有利的。工人的生活不应当和农民生活距离太远。我们工人阶级不能只看眼前和局部的利益，应当看到长远和全局的利益。我们工人阶级应当拥护国务院的这些措施。
    国家每年用于职工生活方面的劳动保险费、医疗卫生费、文教费、福利费以及企业奖励基金，都是为数相当大的。过去，这些经费一般地都还用得恰当。但是，有些工作由于工会的领导机关考虑得不够周到，没有和群众充分商量，铺张浪费现象也是存在的。目前的主要问题，就是如何更合理地使用这些经费，使每一分钱都发挥应有的作用，尽可能在不增加开支的条件下，为群众多办一些应当办的事情。这就需要工会协同企业行政，制定各个时期的福利规划。在制定福利规划的时候，应当经过调查研究，倾听群众意见，根据需要和可能，提出方案交职工代表大会讨论，作出决议，把生活福利工作置于群众的监督之下，有效地克服官僚主义。
    组织职工的力量，解决自己可能解决的某些问题，对改善职工生活有着重要的意义。工会必须教育职工群众及其家属，精打细算，勤俭持家，厉行节约，增加储蓄，有计划地安排生活。工会还必须组织职工及其家属，发扬互助友爱精神，举办多种多样的互助互济事业——建立和健全互助储金会；举办托儿站和幼儿园，在可能的条件下，组织职工家属从事养鸡、养猪、缝纫、洗衣、针织、种菜等副业生产。这些都是节省开支，增加收入，改善职工生活的好办法，应当加以提倡。
    工会在处理职工有关生活的要求时，必须调查研究，具体分析，分别对待，加强对职工的思想政治教育工作。对于职工合理的要求，我们必须给以支持，并且帮助行政尽快地予以适当解决。对于职工不合理的要求，或者虽然合理可是一时办不到的要求，我们必须教育职工从整体利益出发，正确地认识生活和生产的关系。必须了解，国家利益是全国人民的共同利益，个人利益必须服从国家利益。一切不顾国家利益和集体利益、而只顾个人利益的个人主义都是错误的，实际结果都将是危害自己的利益。对群众要求不加理睬、敷衍塞责，是不对的；对群众要求不加分析、盲目支持，也是不对的。工会必须把解决职工生活问题和思想政治教育紧密联系起来，通过每一个问题的正确处理，提高职工的社会主义觉悟。
    工会必须积极参与国家关于劳动工资、劳保福利等政策法令的制定和执行。在这些政策法令确定以前，工会必须深入群众，调查研究，发现问题，反映群众的情绪、思想和要求，积极地提出建议，协助党和国家更好地集中群众的意见。在这些政策法令确定以后，又必须积极地向职工群众进行宣传解释，引导群众自觉地执行，并且向一切违反这些政策法令的现象作斗争。
    为了更好地处理职工的生活问题，还必须注意以下几个具体问题：
    几年来，工会在劳动工资方面，做了很多工作。但是，目前工资工作中还存在不少问题，工资制度的某些方面还不够切合实际，奖励制度的某些方面还不够合理。在工资问题上，既要反对平均主义，又要反对过分悬殊。同时，又要考虑到全国大多数人民的现实生活水平。因此，从全面的实际情况出发，根据按劳付酬原则，帮助政府和企业行政因地制宜，进一步改善工资制度，仍然是工会的重要任务之一。
    几年来，工会和企业行政开展了防病防伤工作，显著地降低了职工的发病率；组织职工和职工家属依靠自己的力量，解决了许多生活上的问题；同时举办了业余休养所、疗养院、医疗所、职工食堂、保健食堂、托儿所、哺乳室等事业，帮助职工解决了许多依靠个人力量不可能解决的生活困难问题。举办这些事业是需要的。可是，在这些事业中，还存在着不少缺点，特别是存在着浪费现象。工会应当协同企业行政加强这方面的工作，因地制宜，改善管理，克服浪费，并且发动这些服务部门的职工贯彻为生产服务、为群众服务的方针，切实办好这些事业。
    关于职工住宅问题，第一个五年计划期间，国家虽然已经投资建设了八千万平方米，但是由于职工人数的迅速增加，住宅仍然是紧张的。为了缓和职工住宅的紧张情况，除了国家根据可能有计划地增建以外，工会应当在有条件的地方，组织职工采取自建或者自建公助的办法建筑一部分住宅。在目前情况下，特别要注意帮助那些能够在乡村安家的职工家属尽可能回乡安家。在乡村安家，不仅可以减少个人开支，减少城市负担，还可以使职工家属参加农业劳动，增加收入，使子女就业比较方便。我们的农村是社会主义的农村，有着广阔的发展前途。在农村居住的职工家属，凡有劳动能力的，都应当积极参加农业生产，并且同农民兄弟一道，为建设美好幸福的新农村而努力。
    疾病和子女过多，是一部分职工生活发生困难的重要原因，所以计划生育和卫生工作，也是改善职工生活的重要问题。工会必须组织职工群众及其家属努力搞好爱国卫生运动，改善环境卫生。这不仅可以防止疾病，增进职工及其家属的健康，使职工本人能够经常地出勤生产，而且可以不因疾病增加开支，影响家庭生活。有计划地生育也是职工和职工家属的一个迫切要求。工会必须大力宣传计划生育，协同有关方面推进这个工作。
      六、加强对职工的政治、文化、技术教育、组织职工的文化、体育活动
    我国工人阶级在党的领导下，经历了两次革命和几次政治运动的锻炼和考验，在今年的反右派斗争和整风运动中，又一次充分表现了自己的革命品质，捍卫了社会主义制度和党的领导。我国工人阶级队伍的思想状况和组织状况基本上是好的。
    在现有一千二百万产业工人中，只有35％是解放前的老工人。在65％的新工人中，有一半以上是农民、学生、城市贫民出身的，他们绝大部分是青年，有朝气，肯学习，容易接受新事物。但是小资产阶级思想作风比较浓厚。新工人中还有3％左右是原来的地主、富农、资本家、旧军警和游民分子，他们的剥削阶级意识和坏习气相当严重。
    因此，工会必须通过整风运动和社会主义教育，提高工人阶级的觉悟程度和组织程度。对于少数剥削阶级出身的分子，要进行彻底的思想改造。对于极少数的反社会主义分子、流氓、阿飞和严重违法乱纪分子，必须进行坚决的斗争，经常地改造他们，屡教不改的，应当支持行政给予开除处分，以纯洁工人阶级的队伍。
    社会主义教育的中心内容，按照党的八届三中全会的指示，应当是：“关于工人阶级在社会主义革命和建设事业中的领导地位和领导责任问题，是在无产阶级专政下工人群众的政治任务问题。要使工人群众懂得：必须在共产党领导下，不断提高自己的觉悟，加强组织性和纪律性，增强阶级内部的团结；必须发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，保持大公无私的高贵品质，努力生产，克勤克俭，以自己的模范作用，带动全国人民，为完成社会主义建设而斗争。”
    进行社会主义教育的基本方法是批评与自我批评，此外，还可以采用定期进行时事政治报告、组织工人回忆对比、举办革命历史讲座和革命事迹展览，以及表扬好人好事、反对坏人坏事等方法，教育职工继承工人阶级的革命传统，培养职工的共产主义道德。
    在进行上述这些工作的时候，应当适当照顾女职工和职工家属的一些特点。
    工会会员中有教育工作者、新闻出版工作者、文艺工作者、科学技术工作者、医务工作者，他们是社会主义建设不可缺少的力量。从经济地位上讲，他们是工人阶级的一个组成部分，但从社会出身、意识形态上讲，他们中间的多数还属于资产阶级知识分子的范畴。经过历次政治运动，特别是经过反右派斗争，他们在政治上有了不同程度的进步。有一部分人已经成为左派，他们拥护社会主义制度；多数人处于中间状态，他们可以赞同或者并不反对社会主义，但是他们长期地承受了资产阶级思想的熏陶，要真正变成工人阶级的知识分子，还需要长时间的自我改造。改造从旧社会过来的知识分子，培养新的知识分子，建立一支工人阶级的知识分子队伍，是我国人民的一个严重任务。
    为了改造旧社会过来的知识分子，使他们真正成为工人阶级的知识分子，工会应当加强对于工程技术人员的思想政治工作，加强教育、医务等工会的工作，特别是它们的基层工作。工会应当注意把目前已经开始实行的脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的制度坚持下去，更好地组织知识分子和体力劳动者的合作。对于知识分子的工作条件和生活条件，工会也应给予必要的关怀。
    在加强职工思想政治教育的同时，还必须经常注意组织职工的文化技术学习，提高职工的文化技术水平。
    提高职工的技术水平，主要依靠群众的互教互学。同时，也要广泛推行师徒合同、先进经验学校、技术研究会、技术互助合同以及先进生产者的表演等好办法。青年工人应当尊重老工人，虚心向老工人学习，刻苦钻研，使自己成为一个技术熟练的工人。
    对于不同工种的工人，工会应当协助行政分别地开办专业性和综合性的业余技术训练班，讲授技术理论，交流技术操作经验。在条件比较好的地方，还应当有计划地开办业余技术学校，系统地讲授技术知识，培养大批掌握技术的工人。
    工会要大力地组织职工学习文化。现在还是文盲或半文盲的职工，一般地都应当在今后五年内，把自己提高到初小或高小毕业的程度。
    业余文化技术教师的工作应当受到尊重，工会应当给他们以实际的帮助和支持。他们自己则应当热爱自己的工作，兢兢业业地为工人服务。
    工会要切实地办好各种文化事业，积极地组织职工的文化活动。要继续改进和充实工会的图书馆、俱乐部的活动内容，发挥电影放映队的作用，提高职工的业余文艺美术活动的社会主义的思想性和艺术性，要克服目前在这方面还存在着的一些不健康现象，以及脱离实际和浪费的现象，进一步加强领导，改进工作。
    应该开展群众性的体育运动，克服锦标主义现象。体育运动所需要的设备，除了少数集中的场所以外，要力求简易，并且要尽可能依靠群众自己的力量去解决。
      七、加强工会建设、密切联系群众
    工会必须不断地加强同广大职工群众的联系，这是搞好工会一切工作的基本条件。工会只有真正地联系了群众，同群众息息相通，为群众所信赖，才能够切实地引导群众前进，才能真正成为共产主义的学校。
    工会建设的最重要的环节是思想建设和不断地改进工作作风。要通过整风，坚定不移地贯彻党的工会运动的正确路线，同工会运动中形形色色的修正主义进行坚决的斗争。要通过整风，认真地加强同广大职工群众的联系，切实地克服官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义的现象。
    全国解放以来，在工会干部中，对工会工作的根本方针问题，曾经有过两次重大的争论。第一次，是在完成了民主革命、在全国范围内建立了工人阶级领导的人民民主政权以后，全总领导上对于工会工作的方针任务如何规定，发生了分歧，这就是1951年到1953年中国工会第七次全国代表大会期间所解决的问题。第二次，是在基本上完成了生产资料所有制的社会主义革命的情况下，一部分同志对于建设时期工会工作的根本方针任务，发生了怀疑动摇，这就是最近在整风运动中所解决的问题。两次争论的共同问题，第一是工会要不要接受党的领导的问题；第二是工会应不应当以生产为中心，以及如何正确处理发展生产和改善职工生活的关系问题。事实证明，凡是坚持了党对工会运动的正确路线，工会同各方面的关系就比较正常，就能够把群众团结在党的周围胜利前进。反之，如果脱离党的领导，脱离政治，忽视生产，片面地强调生活问题；忽视一致，片面地强调工会和行政的矛盾，工会同各方面的关系就会失调，工会就会陷于经济主义和工团主义的泥坑，就必然脱离群众。
    整风运动以来，资产阶级右派分子对工会也进行了恶毒的进攻。他们企图使工会脱离社会主义方向，脱离共产党的领导。右派分子的荒谬言论和反动企图，遭到广大职工和工会干部的坚决回击。
    我们工会的工作是在中国共产党中央和各级党委的领导下，沿着正确路线前进的。工会各级组织同群众的关系基本上是好的，是为群众所信赖的。可是，工会在许多方面还存在着严重的脱离实际、脱离群众的官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义现象。在这次整风运动中，职工群众对工会提出了不少批评，这说明工会工作——包括全国总工会的工作在内，还存在着严重的缺点。全国总工会在密切地联系下级组织和职工群众方面、在系统地检查工作、调查研究、总结经验等等方面都有不少缺点。我们应当认真研究群众的批评和建议，坚决改进自己的领导工作，经过这次整风运动，进一步密切同群众的联系。
    要改善领导工作，密切同群众的联系，就应当适当地改造工会干部的队伍。绝大部分工会干部是积极热情，努力工作，联系群众的。可是，我们的干部队伍还有不少弱点。虽然我们有许多干部是从工人群众中生长起来的，是熟悉生产、联系群众的，但是其中一部分人长期脱离生产，不注意联系群众，滋长了官僚主义作风。有一部分干部是转业来的，他们经过革命的锻炼，也有较多的群众工作经验，可是一般地缺乏工业生产知识，缺乏对职工生活状况、思想状况的深刻了解。还有一部分干部是直接从学校来的，他们更缺乏生产知识，缺乏工人阶级的思想感情。因此，我们必须坚决响应党中央的号召，组织干部参加体力劳动。只有这样，我们的干部才能更好地丰富生产知识，锻炼阶级意识，增强阶级感情，克服非无产阶级思想，养成密切联系群众、从实际出发的工作作风。这是改造干部作风、提高干部质量、克服官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义的有效办法。不可能设想，一个工会干部没有生产知识，不了解职工的生活、思想和感情，缺少群众语言，而能够教育职工，并且引导职工去进行社会主义建设。
    在少数民族地区，应当注意培养少数民族出身的工会干部，加强民族团结的教育。
    目前工会领导机关组织重叠，机构庞大，头绪繁多，人浮于事，已经成为工作前进的严重障碍。由于各个地区工业的分布情况、发展情况和工作基础不同，工会的组织形式不必强求全国一致、上下一致。各个地区应当根据实际情况，从便于联系群众、便于深入工作出发，实事求是地进行调整。各地方产业工会的组织形式必须因地制宜，各个产业工会组织范围的划分和产业工会组织的设立，上下不一定完全相同。各省、市产业工会的组织如何划分和调整，主要应当由省、市工会联合会在省、市党委领导下研究确定。工会各级领导机关，都要真正做到精干灵活，人员少，效率高。现有的干部应当大量下放，或者参加体力劳动，或者参加基层工作。财务管理、事业管理的权力，也应当适当下放，以充分发挥地方工会和基层组织的积极性。各地方、各企业的工会工作，都必须在当地党委和企业党委的直接领导下进行。当然，这并不是说全国总工会和产业工会全国委员会的领导就不重要了，就不需要加强了，而是要求把一些不该集中管理的事情下放，使领导机关能够更好地集中力量，进行调查研究和总结经验，能够认真地研究和解决工会运动中的重大问题。这样，才能更好地发挥工会领导机关的作用。
    县镇工会几年来做了不少工作，积累了不少经验，可是过去全国总工会对这方面的工作注意得不够。县镇的职工靠近农村，多数直接为农村服务，做好这一部分职工的工作，对于发展农业生产和巩固工农联盟有着重大意义。特别是在党中央提出“在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业和发展农业同时并举”的方针以后，县镇工会工作就更为重要了。今后，应当积极地加强这方面的工作。
    工会的领导干部，应当经常深入群众进行访问、检查工作。工会各级领导机关，都要定期地向群众报告工作、报告财务，负责地处理群众的来信来访。工会各级组织都必须注意健全基层的小组生活，使小组真正成为职工进行自我教育——批评和自我批评的场所。
    积极分子是密切工会同群众联系的桥梁，工会的许多工作都是要通过他们的努力去实现的。目前我们的三百八十九万积极分子中，绝大部分都是积极热情，朝气蓬勃，努力工作，在各种活动中发挥了重大作用的。可是我们对积极分子的工作还是有缺点的。在积极分子队伍中，还有一部分人，或者是由于缺乏工作办法，或者是由于存在其他实际困难，还没有切实发挥作用。因此，关心积极分子，培养训练积极分子，不断地巩固和扩大积极分子的队伍，提高他们的工作能力，充分发挥他们的作用，就应当成为工会经常的重要工作之一。
      八、加强国际工人阶级的团结，巩固世界和平
    中国共产党经常教导我们，必须加强中国工人阶级同全世界工人阶级的大团结，必须团结国际上一切可能团结的力量。我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，是同伟大的苏联及其他兄弟国家的帮助分不开的，是同全世界工人阶级的援助分不开的，也是同全世界一切爱好和平的人们的正义斗争分不开的。我们对于他们的帮助和支持表示无限的感谢，对于以赛扬同志为首的世界工联代表团和来自世界各国的参加这次会议的朋友们，表示热烈的欢迎。
    学习苏联和各兄弟国家的先进经验，同时还要向全世界各国工人阶级学习，这对于我国社会主义建设事业有着重大意义。
    中国工会第七次全国代表大会以来，我国工会同世界各国工会之间的友好来往有了很大的发展。中国工会接待了来自60个国家的301个工会代表团，来宾达1，982人；在同一时期，中国工会也派遣了149个代表团共900人到28个国家访问。通过这些相互访问、相互了解的活动，中国工会同全世界许多国家的工会建立了密切的友好联系。
    在这个期间，我们曾经同各社会主义国家的工会相互交换了友好代表团和先进生产者代表团。这些活动不仅对于相互学习、交流经验、帮助国家建设以及巩固和发展社会主义国家劳动人民之间的友谊，起了积极的作用，而且对于国际工人阶级的团结事业，有着重大的意义。
    在这个期间，中国工会还根据和平共处的五项原则和万隆会议的精神，同亚非地区的各国工会通过相互访问建立并加强了友好关系。中国工人阶级对于亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的反殖民主义和维护民族独立的斗争，始终寄以同情和支持。
    在这个期间，中国工会同各个资本主义国家工会的友好往来也有了相当的发展。中国工人阶级对于资本主义国家的人民保卫世界和平、反对侵略战争、保卫工会权利、反对垄断资本的斗争，同样给以关怀和支持。
    各国工会虽然各自的处境和政治主张有所不同，但是还有共同要求，这就是保卫世界和平，反对帝国主义，反对殖民主义，反对垄断资本，保卫工会权利，争取改善生活条件和要求全世界工人阶级友好合作。在实现上述共同要求的斗争中，中国工会同各国工会团结友好的关系正在发展着。
    中国工会在发展国际工会友好团结的道路上，曾经遇到过许多困难和阻挠。我们本着平等、自愿、相互尊重、求同存异、友好协商的原则，耐心地进行实际的联系和接触，一再表示我们真诚要求友好团结的愿望，在实际接触中增进相互了解、相互尊重，谋取在共同要求方面的一致行动和相互配合。国际工会组织的被分裂，各国工会之间相互来往的被隔绝，的确造成了一些疑虑和误解。真诚的朋友般的实际接触，会使许多疑虑、误解逐渐消除。尽管有些工会在政治主张方面和我们不尽相同，但是在共同要求下还是可以友好合作的。因此，我们深信，世界各国广大职工群众所愿望的国际工会运动的团结，终究是要实现的。
    目前世界和平的力量正在不断地发展和壮大。最近，在莫斯科召开的十二个社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议，以及随后召开的六十四国共产党和工人党代表会议，和这两个会议发表的两个具有重大历史意义的宣言，显示了世界共产主义运动空前未有的团结。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的政治经济力量日益强大，苏联已经成功地发射了两颗人造卫星，科学技术获得惊人的成就，两大阵营力量的对比已经处在新的转折点；亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民反对殖民主义和维护民族独立的斗争空前高涨，资本主义国家的工人阶级和一切爱好和平的人民，为反对垄断资本的剥削、反对战争、保卫和平的运动日益发展；帝国主义相互之间的矛盾日益扩大，美帝国主义日益孤立。所有这些，都说明新世界的力量已经超过旧世界的力量，国际形势更加有利于全世界人民争取持久和平、反对侵略战争。正如毛泽东同志所说的：“现在不是西风压倒东风，而是东风压倒西风。”可是，以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团的扩军备战政策，还威胁着世界和平。美帝国主义正卑鄙地在中东地区进行颠覆活动和武装挑衅，企图用战争威胁来恐吓和打击阿拉伯各国人民的民族独立运动。英、法殖民者在阿曼、阿尔及利亚的血腥屠杀，还在加紧进行。我们必须对正在进行英勇斗争的埃及、叙利亚、阿曼等阿拉伯国家及阿尔及利亚，以及其他为争取和维护民族独立而斗争的国家和人民，给以同情和支援。
    美帝国主义还继续霸占着我国领土台湾，我们必须为巩固国防、解放台湾而斗争。
    美帝国主义侵略集团不顾全世界爱好和平人民关于裁减军备、停止生产和使用核武器、立即停止试验核武器的正义要求，多方进行阻挠和破坏，不愿就上述问题达成协议。我们必须同全世界工人阶级及一切爱好和平的人民团结起来，反对生产、试验和使用核武器，反对战争，保卫世界持久和平。
    我们还必须继续全力加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国之间的团结，特别是继续巩固和加强中苏两国人民牢不可破的伟大团结。中苏两国人民的巩固团结，是维护世界和平的坚强堡垒。
    我们的党和国家的对外政策是完全符合我国工人阶级和全国人民利益的。我们坚决支持党和国家的对外政策。
    中国工会愿意在国际工会运动中继续努力地担当起自己应尽的一分责任。我们将本着第四次世界工会代表大会所通过的决议的精神，继续加强和发展中国工会同世界各国工会之间的联系和友谊，促进国际工会运动的团结。
    同志们！中国工人阶级必须戒骄戒躁，兢兢业业，以自己的模范行动，团结全国人民，团结国内外一切可能团结的力量，艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国。我们相信，中国工人阶级和全国人民一起，在中国共产党的领导下，在苏联和其他兄弟国家的无私援助下，在全世界工人阶级和一切爱好和平人民的支持下，一定能够把我国建设成为一个伟大的繁荣富强的社会主义国家！
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国工人阶级万岁！
    以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的全国人民大团结万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    全世界工人阶级大团结万岁！
    和平万岁！
