The Central Committee entrusted the Political Bureau to formulate and take all necessary measures to implement the principles put forward in these two declarations into the activities of the party and into national and social life, and to ensure that the vast working people of Hungary are mobilized to actively support their realization.

	The resolution went on to say that, according to these two declarations, the Central Committee regards the struggle to defend peace as the primary task. The Party should unite all those in the country who are willing to defend peace more closely, strengthen ties with all peace-loving forces in the world, and strive to establish good relations with the people of all countries with different social systems. We resolutely oppose the destructive and aggressive activities of international imperialists who threaten human peace, and oppose their open incitement to war and activities that undermine peace.

In order to build socialism, to defend peace, and to oppose bourgeois ideology, we oppose the despicable attacks on Marxism-Leninism and the revisionist views that create the main danger in the country, and oppose the dogmatic and sectarian views that hinder the development of the party. In this struggle we are united, and we must continue to strengthen our solidarity with the first socialist country in the world, the leading socialist country - the great Soviet Union, as well as with all socialist countries, all fraternal communist parties, workers' parties, and the international working class.
