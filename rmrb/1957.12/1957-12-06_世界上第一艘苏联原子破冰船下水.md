Xinhua News Agency, Leningrad, 5th December. The "Lenin" nuclear-powered icebreaker was launched today. The important stage of building the world's first nuclear-powered icebreaker on the slipway has come to an end.

　　This future flagship of the Soviet icebreaker fleet has a displacement of 16,000 tons. It is 134 meters long, 27.6 meters wide at its widest point, and has a draft of 9.2 meters. This nuclear-powered ship, which will cross the Arctic, can reach a speed of 32 kilometers per hour on ice-free seas. It can easily break through ice layers 2 meters thick while sailing.

　　The equipment in the ship's engine room was manufactured by approximately 500 enterprises. The main engine of the nuclear-powered icebreaker has a power of 44,000 horsepower (currently, the world's largest American icebreaker, the "Glacier," has a power of 22,000 horsepower).

　　The trans-Arctic nuclear-powered icebreaker is capable of independent navigation for many months without calling at ports.

　　Current icebreakers need to carry more than 2,000 tons of fuel for long-distance voyages, and their voyages from base cannot exceed one month. The nuclear-powered icebreaker consumes only a few centimeters of nuclear "fuel" per day and night. The heat energy emitted by the nuclear reactor turns the water in the icebreaker's steam generator into high-pressure steam. The high-pressure steam then drives the steam turbine generator. The powerful electric motor, which obtains current from the generator, turns the propeller shaft of the ship.

　　Above the engine room where the nuclear reactor is installed is the "power station." The dispatcher in charge of the ship's power plant only needs to determine the thermal regime of the reactor, which can be automatically executed by specialized instruments.

　　The captain can control the ship's navigation from the pilot house or upper bridge through automatic devices, giving it the necessary speed and direction. This greatly increases the ship's flexibility in navigating seas with complex ice conditions.

　　There are approximately one thousand cabins above and below the icebreaker's deck. Each crew member lives in a cabin for one or two people. The designers and builders of the icebreaker designed absolutely reliable protective equipment to protect the crew from radiation hazards.

### 世界上第一艘苏联原子破冰船下水

　　世界上第一艘苏联原子破冰船下水
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社列宁格勒讯：“列宁号”原子破冰船已于今天下水。世界上第一艘原子破冰船在船台上建造的重要阶段已经结束。
    苏联破冰船队这艘未来的旗舰的排水量为一万六千吨。船长一百三十四公尺，船身最宽的地方为二十七点六公尺，吃水九点二公尺。这艘将横越北极的原子船在未结冰的海面上每小时速度可达三十二公里。它在行驶中可以轻而易举地铲开二公尺厚的冰层。
    这条船机舱内的设备是由约五百个企业参加制造的。原子破冰船主要发动机的功率为四万四千马力（目前世界最大的美国破冰船“冰河号”的功率为二万二千马力）。
    泛北极原子破冰船能够许多月不停靠港口独立航行。
    现在的破冰船，如要作远程航行，就要带两千多吨燃料，而且离开基地的航期还不能超过一个月。原子破冰船一昼夜只消耗几十公分核“燃料”。原子反应堆所发出的热能使破冰船蒸汽发生器中的水变成高压蒸汽。高压蒸汽再推动汽轮发电机。从发电机获得电流的强大的电动机就使船的推进器轴转动起来。
    在安装原子反应堆的机舱的上面设有“动力岗”。管理船上动力装置的调度员只需要确定反应堆的热工制度，他所确定的制度可以由专门的仪器自动执行。
    船长可以从领航室或上层舰桥通过自动装置操纵船的航行，使它具有必要的速度和方向。这就大大提高船在冰情复杂的海面上航行的灵活性。
    破冰船甲板上下约有一千个船舱。船员每一个人或两个人住一个船舱。破冰船的设计师和建造者设计了绝对可靠的保护设备，保护船上人员不受辐射危害。
