Respected President of the China-Myanmar Friendship Association, Mr. Zheng Zhenduo, dear friends led by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai:

Like meeting our own relatives again, the friendly delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein and myself have been warmly welcomed everywhere in China, and we feel unspeakable joy.

The welcome of the Chinese people to us is very warm. Although we came to China during the cold season, we do not feel the cold because of this warmth.

In my opinion, the friendship between Myanmar and China is by no means the friendship between two ordinary friendly countries, but the friendship between two related countries.

When we look back at the history of our two countries, we can see that Myanmar and China have always been friendly to each other in history. For more than two thousand years, we have always been friendly to each other except for two or three insignificant things that happened. And even the two or three insignificant things I just mentioned were just like very small matters between brothers.

After reviewing the history of our two countries, let us look at the geographical relationship between our two countries. As the Chinese saying goes, our two countries are truly "mountains connected to mountains, waters connected to waters." The people of the two countries living in this place where "mountains are connected to mountains and waters are connected to waters" have formed relatives since ancient times. We in Myanmar also have a saying similar to that in China, that is, "living on the same land and drinking water from the same river." Myanmar and China are countries that "live on the same land and drink water from the same river."

Because of this, we Burmese have regarded the Chinese people as our "Pauk-phaw" for thousands of years. "Pauk-phaw" means siblings born of the same mother. Since ancient times, the people of Myanmar and the people of China have not been strangers to each other, but relatives. Therefore, we are not just ordinary friendly countries, but countries like relatives.

Now, let us look at the current situation. Our two countries have both experienced painful pasts and become new independent countries, and we are in a new era. We are now working hard to build our own new countries. Thanks to the foresight of the leaders of the two countries, our friendly relations have become more developed and consolidated than in the past. I believe that in this new era, our friendly relations will be further consolidated and developed.

The people of Myanmar and China both urgently demand world peace, and we are now working side by side for world peace. Our two countries agree on the principle that regardless of differences in ideology and social systems, regardless of the size of the country, the size of the nation, and the color of the skin, any country can coexist peacefully. It is based on this principle that our two countries are working side by side to defend world peace.

Together with your country's visionary leaders, we are working hard to further develop friendly relations between the two countries. For example, we must continue to further develop friendly relations between leaders of the two countries, soldiers, writers, scholars, and people from all walks of life. We must further develop trade between the two countries and expand cultural exchanges to further strengthen the friendship between the two countries.

The friendship between our two countries and the people of our two countries is based on mutual trust. Therefore, no conspiracy or threat can destroy the friendship between us.

As I said at the airport when I arrived in your country's capital, the people of our two countries are not only friends, but also relatives. At that time, I asked everyone to allow me to call you "Pauk-phaw". Now, when I meet you dear friends here, please allow me once again to call you "Pauk-phaw".

I wish you all, "Pauk-phaw", good health!

Long live Myanmar-China friendship!

May Myanmar and China work side by side for peace in Asia and the world!

### 吴巴瑞副总理的讲话

　　吴巴瑞副总理的讲话敬爱的中缅友好协会会长郑振铎先生，以中国周恩来总理为首的亲爱的朋友们：
    我和吴觉迎副总理所率领的友好代表团，像重新见到自己的亲戚一样，在中国到处都受到热烈的欢迎，我们感到说不尽的欢喜。
    中国人民对我们的欢迎非常温暖。虽然我们来到中国的时候，正是严寒的季节。但是，由于这种温暖，我们并不感到天气寒冷。
    依我来看，缅中两国的友谊决不是两个普通的友好国家的友谊，而是两个亲戚国家的友谊。
    当我们回顾我们两国的历史时，我们就可以看到，缅中两国在历史上是一贯互相友好的。在两千多年中，我们两国除了曾经发生过两三件微不足道的事情以外，我们之间始终是友好的。并且，即使是我刚才所说的那两三件微不足道的事情，它不过是好像兄弟之间的很小的事情而已。
    在回顾我们两国的历史之后，我们再来看看我们两国的地理关系。正如中国的俗语说，我们两国在地理上真是“山连山，水连水”。而在这“山连山，水连水”的地方居住着的两国人民，自古以来就结成了亲戚。我们缅甸也有一句同中国差不多的俗语，这就是“在同一块土地上居住，同喝一条河流的水”。我们缅中两国，就是这种“在同一块土地上居住，同喝一条河流的水”的国家。
    正因为这样，我们缅甸人上千年以来就把中国人民看做是自己的胞波。胞波就是同母所生的同胞兄弟的意思。自古以来，缅甸人民和中国人民就不是陌生的相处，而是亲戚般的相处。因此，我们就不是一般的友好国家，而是亲戚般的国家。
    现在，我们再来看看目前的情况。我们两国都已经经历了痛苦的过去而成为新的独立国家，处在一个新的时代里，我们现在都正在努力建设各自的新国家。由于两国领导人的远见，我们的友好关系已经比过去更加发展和巩固。我相信，在这个新的时代里，我们的友好关系还将得到进一步的巩固与发展。
    缅中两国人民都迫切要求世界和平，并且我们现在正并肩为世界和平而努力。我们两国都同意这样的原则，即不论思想意识、社会制度有何不同，不论国家大小、民族大小和肤色的黑白，任何国家都可以和平共处。就是根据这样的原则，我们两国正在并肩为保卫世界和平而努力。
    我们和贵国的有远见的领导人一起，都在为两国友好关系的进一步发展而努力。譬如，我们要继续在两国领导人之间，军人、作家、学者等各方面人士之间，进一步发展友好关系。我们要进一步发展两国贸易，扩大文化交流，以进一步加强两国的友谊。
    我们两国和两国人民的友谊是基于相互间的信任，因此，不论任何阴谋和威胁，都不能破坏我们之间的友谊。
    正如我在到达贵国首都时在机场上所说过的，我们两国人民不仅是朋友，还是亲戚。那时，我就请大家允许我把你们称为胞波。现在，当我在这儿和各位亲爱的朋友见面时，请你们再一次允许我把你们称呼为胞波。
    祝各位胞波健康！
    缅中友好万岁！
    祝缅中两国并肩为亚洲和世界和平而努力！
