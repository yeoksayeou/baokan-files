Kingdom of Yemen

The Kingdom of Yemen is located in the southwest of the Arabian Peninsula, at the gateway of the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean. It covers an area of approximately 195,000 square kilometers and has a population of approximately five million. The vast majority are Arabs who adhere to Islam. The capital is Sana'a.

In the mostly desert Arabian Peninsula, Yemen is a rich place. Due to abundant rainfall and fertile land, agricultural products are abundant, giving it the name "Arabian Paradise." The people of Yemen are mainly engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. Yemen's coffee is world-renowned and is its main export. In addition, leather and grapes are also important export commodities. Yemen is also rich in mineral resources.

Yemen's abundant resources and its strategically important position have long attracted the aggressive ambitions of imperialists. In history, Yemen was twice occupied by the Turks. The Yemeni people have continuously launched armed struggles to oppose colonial oppression and defend their sovereignty and independence. After the First World War, Yemen finally got rid of Turkish rule and established an independent country.

Western colonialists have constantly invaded Yemen. In 1839, Britain forcibly occupied Aden, a territory of Yemen, and later expanded the occupied territory and placed the southern region of Yemen under its "protection," calling it the so-called "protectorate." In 1934, Britain forced Yemen to sign the unequal Treaty of Sana'a. The treaty stipulated that within forty years, the two sides should establish a joint planning committee to determine the boundaries between Yemen and the so-called Aden "protectorate"; before the boundaries were determined, both sides should maintain the status quo of the boundaries on the date the treaty was signed. In this treaty, Britain deliberately did not determine the boundaries in order to further encroach on Yemeni territory.

In order to realize its conspiracy to completely control Yemen, the British colonialists twice carried out shameful subversive activities in Yemen. In January 1948, Britain instigated Yemeni traitors to assassinate King Yahya of Yemen. Three months later, the eldest son of the deceased king, namely the current King Ahmed of Yemen, led his troops in a counterattack and restored the regime. In March 1955, Britain colluded with the then Foreign Minister Abdullah to launch a coup, forcing King Ahmed to abdicate. However, Crown Prince Badr of Yemen led tribal troops supporting the king to quell the rebellion and restore order. In August 1949, Britain used threats and inducements to demand that Yemen recognize Britain's further plunder of Yemeni territory and its right to exploit oil in Yemeni territory. Yemen rejected this unreasonable demand, and Britain then forcibly occupied the Shabwa oil-producing area of Yemen. Since 1951, despite repeated protests from the Yemeni government, Britain has begun to extensively build strategic highways, military airports, and other military facilities in the undefined border areas, and connected the newly built refinery in Aden with the highway between the Shabwa oil-producing area.

In 1956, after the failure of the British invasion of Egypt, it launched an armed invasion of Yemen, bombing Yemeni cities and villages and massacring peaceful residents. In August of this year, Britain launched continuous attacks on the southern region of Yemen. The Yemeni people have launched a heroic and unyielding struggle against the British invaders to defend their independence and freedom.

Britain's aggression against Yemen has aroused widespread anger among the people of the world, especially the people of Asian and African countries. The final communique of the Asian-African Conference held in April 1955 stated: "The Asian-African Conference supports Yemen's position on the issue of Aden and the southern Yemeni region called the protectorate, and calls on the parties concerned to achieve a peaceful settlement of this dispute."

After the Second World War, American colonial forces tried to infiltrate Yemen. In 1946, the United States seized Yemen's oil exploitation rights with a loan of one million US dollars. British and American imperialists are engaged in fierce competition for Yemen's oil and markets.

Yemen is a member of the United Nations. The Yemeni government actively pursues a foreign policy of peace and neutrality, opposes colonial aggression, opposes the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and develops friendly relations with all countries.

In August 1956, the Yemeni government announced its recognition of our country. Now, Crown Prince, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defense of Yemen, Badr, is visiting our country at the invitation of Premier Zhou, which will greatly strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries.

    也门王国
    也门王国位于阿拉伯半岛西南部，扼红海通印度洋的咽喉。面积约十九万五千平方公里，人口约五百万。绝大部分是阿拉伯人，信奉伊斯兰教。首都是萨那。
    在多沙漠的阿拉伯半岛上，也门是一个富饶的地方。由于雨量较多，土地肥沃，因此农产品丰富，有“阿拉伯乐园”之称。也门人民主要从事农业和畜牧业。也门的咖啡闻名世界，是它主要的出口货。此外，皮革和葡萄也是重要的出口物资。也门的矿藏也很丰富。
    也门的丰富资源和它在战略上的重要地位，早就引起了帝国主义者的侵略野心。在历史上，也门曾两度被土耳其人侵占。也门人民为反对殖民主义压迫，保卫自己的主权和独立，曾不断地展开武装斗争。第一次世界大战后，也门终于摆脱了土耳其的统治，建立了独立的国家。
    西方殖民者不断地对也门进行侵略。1839年，英国强占了也门的领土亚丁，以后又把侵占的领土扩大，并把也门南部地区置于它的“保护”之下，称为所谓“保护地”。1934年，英国迫使也门同它签订了不平等的萨那条约。条约规定，在四十年内，双方应成立一个联合的计划委员会，以确定也门和所谓亚丁“保护地”之间的疆界；在未确定以前，双方应保持条约签订日的边界现状。在这个条约中，英国故意不确定疆界，以便进一步蚕食也门的领土。
    英国殖民者为了实现完全控制也门的阴谋，曾经两度在也门制造可耻的颠覆活动。1948年1月，英国指使也门的内奸谋杀了也门国王亚哈雅。三个月后，故王长子即现在也门国王艾哈迈德率兵反攻，恢复了政权。1955年3月英国又勾结当时的外交大臣阿卜杜拉发动政变，强迫国王艾哈迈德退位，但是，也门王太子巴德尔率领支持国王的部落军队平服了叛乱，恢复了秩序。英国在1949年8月又用威胁利诱的手段要求也门承认英国对也门领土的进一步掠夺和在也门领土上开采石油的权利，也门拒绝了这种无理要求，英国便以武力强占了也门的沙波尔石油产区。自1951年以来，英国不顾也门政府的一再抗议，在未定界地区开始广泛地修筑战略公路、军用机场和其它军事设施，并把英国在亚丁新建的炼油厂和沙波尔石油矿区之间的公路联接起来。
    1956年，英国侵略埃及战争失败后，便对也门发动了武装侵略，轰炸也门的城市和乡村，屠杀和平居民。今年8月间，英国又对也门南部地区不断发动了进攻。也门人民为捍卫独立和自由，对英国侵略者展开了英勇不屈的斗争。
    英国对也门的侵略，引起了全世界人民、特别是亚非各国人民的普遍愤怒。1955年4月举行的亚非会议最后公报中表示：“亚非会议支持也门在亚丁和被称为保护国的也门南部地区问题上的立场，并要求有关方面获致这一争端的和平解决”。
    第二次世界大战后，美国殖民势力力图渗入也门。1946年，美国以一百万美元的贷款攫取了也门的石油开采权。英美帝国主义者为了争夺也门的石油和市场，进行着剧烈的竞争。
    也门是联合国的会员国。也门政府积极奉行和平中立的外交政策，反对殖民主义的侵略，反对“艾森豪威尔主义”，同各国发展友好关系。
    1956年8月，也门政府宣布承认我国。现在也门王太子、副首相兼外交和国防大臣巴德尔应周总理邀请来我国访问，将大大加强两国友好关系。（胡真）（附图片）
