The name of Xie Zhongjie was not on the first list of cadres to be sent down announced by the Tianjin Steel Plant. After work, Xie Zhongjie returned home and lay on the bed, pondering with a heavy heart.

Xie Zhongjie is twenty-six years old this year. After graduating from high school, he went to work at the Tianjin Steel Plant in 1951. In October 1956, he was promoted to Deputy Chief of the Technical Education Section, acting as the Chief. His wife, Zhou Wenhui, works in the plant's laboratory. Both of them are members of the Communist Youth League. The Youth League branch mobilized its members to respond to the Party's call to "go to the countryside, go to the labor front." Both of them submitted applications to the plant's Party committee requesting to be sent down to production labor for training. However, their names were not on the first list of cadres to be sent down. Zhou Wenhui thought that if she couldn't be sent down this time, she would consider it later. Xie Zhongjie was a little puzzled: because when the downsizing of the organization and sending down of cadres was being discussed, everyone believed that the Technical Education Section could be eliminated, most of the cadres in the section could be sent down, and a small number of cadres and technical education work could be merged into the Cadre Section. He felt that his application to go down to participate in production labor was very appropriate, but why wasn't he on the announced list of cadres to be sent down?

His mother saw that he was so unhappy, but she couldn't figure out what was going on. When she saw her daughter-in-law coming in, she walked away. His wife understood his concerns and advised him to talk to the Party Secretary in detail tomorrow.

The next day, after a detailed conversation, the Party Secretary agreed to Xie Zhongjie being sent down. Now, Xie Zhongjie's difficulty is: how to get through to his mother? Because since his father passed away when he was two years old, his mother had worked hard to raise him, send him to school, and wholeheartedly hoped that he would become someone important and accomplish great things, only wishing him to rise higher and higher. How could she agree to him being sent down to participate in production labor? He had not dared to mention his application to be sent down to his mother all these days. But now, he had to. Back home, Xie Zhongjie said very shyly to his mother: "Mom! I have applied to be sent down to production labor for training, and the Party Secretary of the plant has agreed,..."

"Don't lie to me, I don't believe it!" His mother said unhappily and turned away. Xie Zhongjie felt that he couldn't say anything more now, so he would take his time later.

In order to meet the needs of the plant's expansion, the Tianjin Steel Plant sent more than a hundred cadres down to the plant's Second Branch this time. The plant held a grand farewell meeting. Xie Zhongjie and other cadres who were approved to be sent down expressed their determination at the meeting to undergo good training and transformation in production labor. After the meeting, Xie Zhongjie rushed home and shouted loudly to his mother as soon as he entered the house: "Mom! The plant held a meeting today to see us off! I'm going to the workshop to work tomorrow. Look, the plant gave me a certificate of merit, and the comrades also put a glorious flower on me! I have to quickly write a letter to my aunt in Wuhan to tell her the good news, right?"

His mother saw the certificate of merit and the glorious flower, and knew that the matter of being sent down was true. She lowered her face and said, "Don't anger me! There are many cadres living in this courtyard, but I haven't heard of anyone else being sent down. It must be because you are useless that you were sent down. You still have the nerve to write a letter to your aunt! Are you deliberately making me lose face? You are not allowed to write!"

After that, Xie Zhongjie's mother ignored him for several days in a row. No matter how he explained, she didn't want to listen.

After the cadres were sent down to the Second Branch, the Second Branch held a warm welcome meeting. The Party General Branch also gathered the newly sent-down cadres for a meeting and asked them what difficulties they had. Xie Zhongjie said: "I don't have any other difficulties, but the steel wire on the 24-inch machine weighs fifty or sixty kilograms, and I'm worried that I can't lift it." A comrade told him: "It doesn't matter. Although a coil of steel wire weighs fifty or sixty kilograms, as long as you are not afraid of getting dirty and not afraid of getting tired, and you try a few more times, you can learn to use skill to unload and load it." Xie Zhongjie returned to the work section with the attitude of trying again. When it was almost time to get off work, Master Yang took out a "Wire Drawing Operation Regulations" and handed it to Xie Zhongjie, saying: "I copied this myself. I have a low level of education, and my handwriting is not good, but you can read it, memorize it, and think about it when you work, and it will be more convenient to work. Give it back to me after you're done reading it." Xie Zhongjie went back and seriously read the operating regulations.

One day after work, there was a power outage, and they couldn't work. Master Yang took Xie Zhongjie to the side of the 24-inch machine and disassembled the machine to explain the structure of the machine to him, and taught him how to scrub, how to check, and how to turn it on and off. He understood the structure and usage of this machine, and he also tried to lift the coil of steel wire weighing fifty or sixty kilograms, and he was actually able to lift it. He was extremely happy.

Under the patient guidance of Master Yang and the help of other worker comrades, because Xie Zhongjie was willing to put in effort, willing to use his brain, and worked hard, he was able to master the operations of pressing the tip, grinding the tip, loading and unloading steel wire, etc., in less than a month, and he could also make original records of various steel wire products.

Someone asked Master Yang: "How is Xie Zhongjie doing?" Master Yang replied: "Xie Zhongjie is really a good apprentice. The workers in our wire drawing section generally reflect that: 'This sent-down section chief cadre really has a drive!' Some of those who came to be apprentices after graduating from junior high school last year originally thought they were 'underappreciated' and 'had no future,' and they were very uneasy about their work, and they were picky about their work; now, they say: 'Xie Zhongjie is a high school graduate, and he has also been a deputy section chief, and he works very hard as an apprentice. What else do we have to be underappreciated?' So they are more active in their work than before."

At home, Xie Zhongjie has undergone great changes. When he used to work in the section, he didn't talk much when he came home every day. After eating, he just read books and newspapers, listened to the radio, and went to bed. Now, every day when he comes home, he excitedly tells his mother and wife about the things in their work section: how good the veteran workers and worker comrades are to him; what he learned today; what kind of work he can do again; etc. His wife shares the joy he brings back from production labor. At first, his mother just listened to him silently, without saying a word. Later, she heard the sound of cars and gongs and drums sending cadres down to the countryside and factories from outside every day; she also saw that several cadres in their courtyard were also sent down to workshops to participate in production; Zhou Wenhui's brother-in-law, Luan Quanxun, an engineer from the Civil Construction Design Institute, also came to their home to congratulate Xie Zhongjie, and Luan Quanxun said that he had also applied to be sent down and asked to work as a construction worker; The aunt in Wuhan also wrote to ask if Xie Zhongjie and his wife had applied to be sent down. Xie Zhongjie's mother was originally worried: would her son's salary be reduced if he was sent down? Would they not be able to live in the cadre dormitory anymore? However, it has been almost a month, and the salary is still the same, and they have not heard that they have to move. These things gradually made her realize that: sending cadres down is a new rule of the country, and participating in production labor is a new atmosphere in the new society. In addition, these days, she saw her son: talking and laughing when he came home; his appetite had more than doubled from before; his body was also stronger than before; his yellow face also had a red glow; and he was also willing to help with housework. Therefore, she gradually became happy too. Now, she urged her son to write a letter to his aunt instead. The son deliberately asked: "What should I write in the letter?" She said: "You should write that you have been approved to be sent down to be a worker, that your body has been strengthened, and that your young master airs have been removed, and that you are not as lazy as before."

    下放的喜讯
    本报记者  钟林
    天津钢厂第一次宣布的下放干部名单中，没有谢忠诫的名字。下班以后，谢忠诫回到家里就往床上一趟，心事重重地沉思起来。
    谢忠诫今年二十六岁。他在高中毕业后，1951年到天津钢厂工作，1956年10月被提升为技术教育科副科长，代行科长职务。他的妻子周文慧在本厂化验室工作。他俩都是共青团员。团支部动员团员响应党的“到农村去，到劳动战线上去”的号召，他俩都向厂的党委会提出了要求下放到生产劳动中去锻炼的申请书。可是，第一次宣布的下放干部名单中，没有他俩的名字。周文慧认为自己这次不能下放，那就以后再说。谢忠诫却有点纳闷：因为在酝酿紧缩机构、下放干部的时候，大家都认为技术教育科可以取消，科内大部分干部可以下放，小部分干部和技术教育工作，可以合并到干部科去。他感到自己申请下放去参加生产劳动是很合适的，但为什么宣布的下放干部名单中没有自己呢？
    他的母亲见他这样不高兴，也摸不清怎么回事，见着媳妇进来，她就走开了。妻子了解他的心事，劝他明天去找党委书记详细谈一谈。
    第二天，经过一番详细的交谈以后，党委书记同意谢忠诫下放了。现在，谢忠诫感到困难的是：怎样打通母亲的思想呢？因为自从他父亲在他两岁的时候去世以后，母亲费尽心血把他抚养长大，供他上学，一心指望他出人头地做一番大事，只愿他步步高升，哪会同意他下放去参加生产劳动呢？这些日子他一直没有敢跟母亲提起申请下放这件事。但是，现在不提不行了。回到家里，谢忠诫很腼腆地向母亲说道：“妈！我申请下放到生产劳动中去锻炼，厂里党委书记已经同意了，……”
    “你别骗我，我不信！”母亲很不高兴地说了这么一句话，扭头就走开了。谢忠诫感到现在没法再说下去了，那就以后慢慢来吧。
    天津钢厂为了适应本厂扩建的需要，这次把一百多个干部下放到本厂的二分厂去。厂里隆重地举行了欢送大会。谢忠诫和其他一些获准下放的干部，都在大会上表示了要在生产劳动中好好进行锻炼和改造的决心。散会以后，谢忠诫奔回家里，一进屋子就对母亲大声喊道：“妈！厂里今天开大会欢送我们啦！我明天就要下车间做工去了。你看，厂里发给我一张奖状，同志们还给我挂上光荣花咧！我得赶紧写封信给在武汉的姨妈报个喜吧？”
    母亲看到奖状和光荣花，知道下放的事情是真的了。把脸一沉，说道：“你别气我啦！这个院里住着好些干部，也没听说别人有谁下放，一定是你不中用才下放了，还好意思给姨妈写信哩！你存心给我丢脸呀？不许写！”
    这以后，谢忠诫的母亲一连好几天都不大答理他。任他怎么解释，她连听也不愿听。
    下放干部到了二分厂，二分厂里举行过热烈的欢迎大会以后，工段长把谢忠诫带领到拉丝工段，走到二十四吋车旁边，工段长指着一位工人给他介绍道：“这是杨孝华同志，你就跟他学拉丝”。谢忠诫紧紧握着杨孝华的手道：“杨师傅，希望你多多指教我吧！”杨孝华说：“别客气，咱们互相学习吧”。接着，杨孝华把小组里其他两个工人给谢忠诫作了介绍。
    第二天，谢忠诫提前来到工段里，一看，杨师傅和那两位工人也来到了。杨师傅拿了一套工作服，告诉谢忠诫如何穿着，特别嘱咐他要把袖口和鞋带绑扎好，以免被机器挂上，一个工人腾出一只存放工作服的木箱子，叫他下班后暂且先用。后来，这位工人又找了废木料作了一只箱子，送给他存放工作服。杨师傅告诉他一些必须注意的安全事项，并且对他说：“你刚来，别着急，先看看再插手，机器转得很快，钢丝的劲也很大，你可不能乱摸乱动，以免发生危险”。
    谢忠诫站着看了一会儿，杨师傅又对他说：“我们干活都是站着干的，一站就站它八小时；你站不惯，累了可以坐下歇歇，慢慢锻炼锻炼就站得惯了”。谢忠诫说：“不要紧，用不着休息，让我先学学站它八小时吧”。杨师傅笑了。他很高兴这个新来的徒弟的这种决心。
    看了半天，谢忠诫有点憋不住了，他想插手学干活。杨师傅就教他把钢丝穿进模子压尖和把钢丝在砂轮上磨尖的操作方法。学干这个活，得先学把钢丝弯成N字形。谢忠诫的手都疼得不能马上伸直了，却还没有学会。第二天学会了，杨师傅立即表扬了他，并且告诉他压尖要如何压，才不会把钢丝压扁，磨尖要如何磨，才不会把钢丝磨起飞刺。他看到杨师傅和别的工人在拉钢丝的时候，钢丝在他们手里好像很驯服，但钢丝在他手里就不驯服。杨师傅告诉他：“钢丝落子朝那边转，你也拎着钢丝朝那边转，它就听你的了”。这些活初看起来好像很简单，但作起来并不简单，不仅要用力气，还要懂一定的技术才能作啊！
    这天，厂里的领导同志去看望下放到车间的干部们，二分厂的党总支又召集刚下放的干部们开会，问他们有什么困难。谢忠诫说：“别的困难我倒没有，二十四吋车上的钢丝有五、六十公斤重，我耽心抱不动”。有个同志告诉他说：“不要紧，一盘钢丝虽然有五、六十公斤重，但像你这样的身体，只要不怕脏、不怕累，多试几回，学会用巧劲就能卸也能上了”。谢忠诫抱着再试试看的态度回到工段里。到快下班的时候，杨师傅掏出一本“拉丝操作规程”来交给谢忠诫说：“这是我自己抄下来的，我文化水平低，字写得不好，但你可以看看，把它背熟，干活的时候再寻思寻思，干起来就更方便了。你看完了再还给我吧”。谢忠诫回去就认真读起操作规程来。
    有天上班后，停电了，不能干活。杨师傅把谢忠诫带到二十四吋车盘旁边，把机器拆卸开来，给他讲解机器的构造情形，并且教他如何擦洗、如何检查和如何开关等等。他明白了这个机器的构造和用法，还试着抱了一下那盘有五、六十公斤重的钢丝，结果居然能够抱得起来，他真高兴极了。
    在杨师傅的耐心指教和其他工人同志的帮助下，由于谢忠诫肯出力气，肯动脑筋，勤学苦练，所以不到一个月的功夫，他已经能够掌握压尖，磨尖，上、卸钢丝等活的操作了，而且可以作各种钢丝产品的原始记录了。
    有人问杨师傅：“谢忠诫干得怎么样？”杨师傅回答说：“谢忠诫可真是个好徒弟。我们拉丝工段的工人们普遍反映说：‘这个下放的科长干部真有股干劲呀！’去年在初中毕业后来当学徒的，有的人原来认为‘屈才’，‘没前途’，工作很不安心，干起活来挑肥拣瘦；现在，他们说：‘人家谢忠诫是高中毕业生，还当过副科长，当起学徒来也干得很起劲，咱们还有什么可屈才的？’所以他们干活也比从前积极了”。
    在家里，谢忠诫可是有了很大的变化。从前在科里工作的时候，他每天回家说话也不多，吃了饭只是看看书报，听听收音机就睡觉。现在呀，每天回到家里，他就兴高采烈地对母亲和妻子讲他们工段里的事：老师傅和工人同志们对他怎么好呀；他今天又知道了点什么呀；又会干了点什么活呀；等等。妻子分享着他在生产劳动后带回来的愉快。起初，他母亲只是默默地听着他讲，一点也不做声。后来，她天天听到外面传来的欢送下放干部下乡、下厂的汽车喇叭声和锣鼓声；又看到他们住的院子里也有好几个干部下放到车间参加生产；周文慧的姐夫、民用建筑设计院的工程师栾全训，也到他们家里来向谢忠诫祝贺，而且栾全训说他也申请下放了，要求去作建筑工人；在武汉的姨妈也来信问谢忠诫夫妇是不是申请下放了。谢忠诫的母亲原来耽心：儿子下放是不是就要减薪？干部宿舍是不是也不能住了？可是，快一个月了，工薪仍然照旧，也没有听说要他们搬家。这些，使她逐渐认识到：干部下放是国家的新规矩，参加生产劳动是新社会的新风气。加上这些天来，她看到儿子：回家后有说有笑；饭量比从前增加了一倍多；身体也比从前结实多了；发黄的脸上也有红光了；也肯帮着干家务活了。于是，她也逐渐变得高兴起来了。现在，她反而催促儿子给他姨妈写信了。儿子故意问道：“信上都写些什么呢？”她说：“你就写你得到批准下放去当了工人，身体锻炼得强健起来了，少爷架子也整掉了，不像从前那样懒了”。
