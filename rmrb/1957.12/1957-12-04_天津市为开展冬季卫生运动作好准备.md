　　Tianjin Prepares for Winter Hygiene Campaign

　　(Our report) Tianjin’s winter patriotic hygiene campaign is gradually moving from planning to action. Many districts and units in Tianjin are actively preparing for the launch of the winter patriotic hygiene campaign.

　　Most streets in Tianjin's Hongqiao, Chengxiang, Xinhua and other districts have trained a large number of Red Cross members and Red Cross health workers. Red Cross societies and community clinics in various streets are organizing members and medical personnel to conduct winter hygiene campaign propaganda to residents through home visits, reading newspapers, holding picture exhibitions and lectures. Activists from Wandezhuang, Liuhe Market, and Wumalu Street are going deep into households at night to centrally exterminate overwintering mosquitoes and flies with medicines. They have also organized hygiene supervision teams to dissuade residents from indiscriminately dumping garbage and sewage.

　　In mid-November, the Tianjin Municipal Health and Epidemic Prevention Station, the Red Cross, and the Science Popularization Association held a rat-catching training class for key personnel, with more than 350 people participating. Now, each district, street, and unit has a group of rat-catching personnel. At present, Tanggu, Nankai and other districts have conducted rat density surveys in key streets.

　　Recently, the Tianjin Patriotic Hygiene Campaign Committee and the Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy also organized more than 60 people including township chiefs, commune directors, and production team leaders from some townships and communes in the suburbs to visit the fixed fertilizer accumulation site of the perennial fertilizer accumulation team in Dagaozhuang Township, Southern Suburb, to prepare for doing a good job in rural environmental sanitation in conjunction with the fertilizer accumulation campaign.

　　Currently, Tianjin is conducting a large-scale publicity campaign against spitting everywhere. Cadres from more than 100 medical and health institutions are using Sundays to conduct publicity against spitting everywhere in busy areas, and have also printed a large number of publicity materials, which are distributed to streets, factories, enterprises, government offices, schools and other units.

    天津市红桥、城厢、新华等区的大部分街道已经训练了大批的红十字会员和红十字卫生员。各个街道的红十字会和地段门诊部正组织会员和医务人员采用入户访问、读报、举办图片展览和讲座等方式，向居民进行冬季卫生活动的宣传。万德庄、六合市场、五马路街的积极分子，利用晚上深入各户用药物集中杀灭越冬蚊蝇。他们还组织了卫生监督小组，劝阻居民不要随地滥倒垃圾和污水。
    11月中旬，天津市卫生防疫站、红十字会、科学普及协会举办了一次捕鼠骨干训练班，有三百五十多人参加学习。现在各区、街，各单位都有了一批捕鼠骨干。目前，塘沽、南开等区已经在重点街道进行了鼠的密度调查。
    最近，天津爱国卫生运动委员会和市农林水利局还组织了郊区部分乡、社的乡长、社主任和生产队长等六十多人，参观了南郊区大高庄乡常年积肥队的固定积肥场，为结合积肥运动搞好农村环境卫生工作作好准备。
    目前，天津市正大规模开展不随地吐痰的宣传活动。一百多个医疗卫生机构的干部利用星期天到热闹区进行不随地吐痰的宣传，并且还印制了大量的宣传品，散发到各街道、工厂企业、机关、学校等单位。
