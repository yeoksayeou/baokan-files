Folding Furniture

    The Harbin Joint Public-Private Songhua River Furniture Factory has recently successfully trial-produced four-in-one folding furniture. This furniture consists of four pieces: a wardrobe, a single wooden bed, a three-drawer desk, and a folding chair. Its characteristics are that it is lightweight and flexible, and can be folded into one piece, making it easy to move. The wardrobe can hang clothes and store bags, and has shelves for placing books and documents. There is a drawer in the upper left corner of the cabinet for office supplies, etc. All the internal shelves are removable. After removing the shelves, the wooden bed, desk and folding chair can all be placed inside the cabinet. The single wooden bed folds into a handbag style, and the folding chair can be loaded into the bed after folding. The lower legs of the desk can lie under the desktop. The above four pieces of furniture are placed together side by side and put into the cabinet to become one piece. The four pieces of furniture weigh ninety-six kilograms.
    This furniture is beautiful in style and inexpensive, making it most suitable for people with unfixed work locations such as those in remote construction, field surveys, and military officers. (Attached pictures)
