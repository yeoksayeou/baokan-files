    Natural Conditions of Three Regions

    Region north of the Yellow River, Qinling Mountains, Bailong River, and the Yellow River (within Qinghai): The land is vast, with a total cultivated area of over 730 million mu, and there are large areas of reclaimable wasteland. The climate in the whole region is generally not bad. North of the Great Wall, the annual growing season is 120 to 170 days, basically one crop per year; in the Liaodong Peninsula and south of the Great Wall, the growing season is about 200 days, generally three crops in two years. The annual rainfall in this region is: about 600 mm in Northeast China, about 630 mm in eastern Hebei, less than 200 mm in Xinjiang, and an average of about 400 mm in other regions.

    The vast majority of cultivated land in the region is planted with food crops such as wheat, corn, millet, sorghum, and soybeans, and some are planted with cotton, flax, sugar beets, etc.

    Region south of the Yellow River and north of the Huai River: This region is the plain area between the Yellow River and the Huai River, with a cultivated area of more than 290 million mu. The climate in the whole region is warm and rainfall is abundant. The annual growing season is more than 220 days, and the annual rainfall is about 600 mm. Basically, there are three crops in two years, and in some areas, five crops in three years and two crops in one year.

    The food crops planted in this region are roughly the same as in the 400-jin region, and the main cash crops are cotton and flue-cured tobacco. The yield of flue-cured tobacco here accounts for more than half of the total national output of flue-cured tobacco.

    Region south of the Huai River, Qinling Mountains, and Bailong River: This region has about 620 million mu of cultivated land. It is the place with the highest temperature and the most rainfall in the country. In the Yangtze River basin, the annual growing season is 250 to 300 days, the rainfall is about 1,000 mm, and there are two or three crops a year; in the area south of the Nanling Mountains, there is almost no frost all year round, the annual rainfall is 1,500 mm to 2,000 mm, and there are basically three crops a year.

    This region has a rich variety of crops. In addition to the main crop of rice, there are also corn, potatoes, wheat, etc.; jute, ramie, sugarcane, cotton, flue-cured tobacco, rapeseed, tea, and silk are also produced here. In addition, rubber, kapok, kenaf, coffee, lemongrass, coconut and many tropical fruits are also produced here.

    三种地区的自然条件
    黄河、秦岭、白龙江、黄河（青海境内）以北地区：土地辽阔，耕地总面积有七亿三千多万亩，并有大面积可垦荒地。全区气候一般不坏，长城以北地区，全年生长期一百二十天至一百七十天，基本上一年一熟；辽东半岛和长城以南地区，生长期二百天左右，一般两年三熟。这个地区年降雨量：东北地区约六百毫米（公厘），河北东部约六百三十毫米，新疆不到二百毫米，其他地区平均四百毫米左右。
    全区耕地绝大部分种植小麦、玉米、谷子、高粱、大豆等粮食作物，部分种植棉花、亚麻、甜菜等。
    黄河以南，淮河以北地区：这个地区是黄河、淮河之间的平原地带，耕地面积两亿九千多万亩。全区气候温暖，雨量较多，全年生长期在二百二十天以上，年降雨量六百毫米左右。基本上是两年三熟，部分地区三年五熟和一年二熟。
    这个地区种植的粮食作物和四百斤地区大致一样，经济作物主要是棉花和烤烟。这里的烤烟产量占全国烤烟总产量的一半以上。
    淮河、秦岭、白龙江以南地区：这个地区耕地约六亿两千多万亩。它是全国气温最高、雨量最多的地方。长江流域年生长期二百五十天到三百天，降雨量约一千毫米，一年两熟或一年三熟；五岭以南地区几乎终年无霜，年雨量一千五百毫米到二千毫米，基本上是一年三熟。
    这个地区农作物种类丰富，除主要作物水稻以外还有玉米、薯类、小麦等；黄麻、苎麻、甘蔗、棉花、烤烟、油菜籽、茶叶、蚕丝等这里也都出产。此外，这里还生产橡胶、木棉、番麻、咖啡、香茅、椰子和许多热带果品等。
