Wuhan Iron and Steel Construction Project Enters New Stage
    Installation Begins on No. 1 Blast Furnace, Twenty Stories High
    (Our Wuhan Dispatch) Correspondent Xiao Ding reports: Installation of the Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 1 Blast Furnace began on the morning of the 16th.
    That day, the weather was clear. The group of workers led by crane operator Jiang Xinhe, who had previously set a new national hoisting record, were working intensely early in the morning on the two-meter-high, more than ten-meter-diameter furnace ring that was about to be lifted. At 10:15 AM, with a whistle from Jiang Xinhe, the 73-meter-high tower crane, following the movement of his green signal flag, lifted the furnace ring, weighing more than 28 tons, off the ground and raised it slowly. When this behemoth rose to more than ten meters, it slowly crossed the blast furnace platform and entered its designated position within the blast furnace body. At 10:45 AM, it was placed in its standard position.
    Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 1 Blast Furnace is currently our country's largest and most technologically advanced blast furnace. Once completed next year, it will be able to produce enough iron each day to manufacture 100,000 double-wheeled double-furrow plows. Its total installation volume is more than 5,000 tons, and the furnace shell has a total of twenty-two rings, equivalent to the height of a twenty-story building. The installation centerline cannot deviate by more than two centimeters.
    The blast furnace site began installation preparations in May. With the help of Soviet expert Okun, a 40-ton tower crane was installed, and a welding training class was established. In the assembly of the blast furnace shell, the workers in the Jiang Xinhe group adopted the method of "one steel plate, three ropes" to balance the lifting force, which increased the work efficiency from assembling one ring in a day and a half to assembling one ring in just over five hours. Zhu Shouju, a riveter with thirty years of experience, boldly suggested using "iron bolt tension" to align the seams of the two rings of steel plate, ensuring that the assembly quality met the standards.
    To ensure that No. 1 Blast Furnace is put into production in 1958, more than ten other projects, including the hot blast stove, gas cleaning chamber, iron-tapping yard, and steam blower station, are also under construction simultaneously. Surrounding No. 1 Blast Furnace, the No. 1 and No. 2 coke ovens, the concentrator, the sintering plant, and the Daye Iron Mine are all under intense construction. (Attached picture)

### 武钢建设工程进入新阶段  二十层楼高的一号高炉开始安装

　　武钢建设工程进入新阶段
    二十层楼高的一号高炉开始安装
    本报武汉电　通讯员萧定报道：武钢一号高炉已于16日上午开始安装。
    这天，天气晴朗，曾经创造全国吊装新纪录的起重工江新河领导的小组工人，一大早就在即将起吊的两公尺高、十公尺多直径的炉圈上紧张劳动。十点一刻，江新河哨声一响，七十三公尺高的塔式吊机便随着他的绿色指挥旗，将这个二十八吨多重的炉圈吊离地面，徐徐上升。当这个庞然大物升到十多公尺高的时候，便缓慢地越过高炉平台，进入高炉本体位置。十点三刻，便按照它的标准地位落位了。
    武钢一号高炉是我国目前最大的、技术装备最新的高炉。它在明年建成后，每昼夜生产的铁可以制造十万部双轮双铧犁。它的整个安装量有五千多吨，炉壳共有二十二圈，相当于二十层楼高，而安装的中心线不能相差两个糎。
    高炉工地从5月份起便开始了安装准备工作。他们在苏联专家奥坤的帮助下，安装了四十吨的塔式吊机；开办了电焊工训练班。在拼装高炉炉壳中，江新河小组工人为了使吊装力量平衡，采用一块钢板三根绳吊的办法，使工效由一天半拼一圈提高到五个多小时拼一圈。具有三十年经验的铆工朱寿菊大胆地建议用“铁栓拉力”对准两圈钢板接缝的办法，使拼装质量达到标准。
    为了保证一号高炉1958年投入生产，还有热风炉、煤气净尘室、出铁场、蒸气鼓风机站等十多个工程项目同时施工。环绕一号高炉的一、二号焦炉、选矿厂、烧结厂、大冶铁矿等都在紧张施工。（附图片）
