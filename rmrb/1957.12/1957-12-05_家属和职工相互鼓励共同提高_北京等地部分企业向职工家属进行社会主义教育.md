　　Families and Employees Encourage Each Other to Improve
　  Some Enterprises in Beijing and Other Places Conduct Socialist Education for Employees' Families

    This newspaper reports that planning socialist education for employees' families who live in concentrated areas during the rectification movement has attracted attention in some factories and mines and has achieved good results.

    Party committees of some state-owned factories and mining enterprises in Beijing and Tangshan conducted education for family members while educating employees; when organizing employees to speak out freely and fully, they also mobilized family activists to offer opinions to leaders; when organizing employees for major debates, they also selected some issues related to families to debate among family members. As a result, many confused thoughts and erroneous ideas of employees and their families were clarified in the debates. Many factories in Beijing conducted thorough deliberation and discussion among family members regarding cadre transfer to lower levels, streamlining of institutions, and other work. Transferred cadres from the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Beijing State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1, and No. 2 have received strong support from employees' families.

    Some factories in Qiqihar City include the education of employees' families in the plans of the Party Committee's Rectification Office, under the unified leadership and arrangement of the Party Committee. Some factories have established a socialist education group for employees' families within the Rectification Office. They have realized that this unified leadership has many benefits: first, it can mobilize families to help the enterprise rectify; second, it can enable families and employees to encourage and improve each other; third, it can enable families to play a leading role among ordinary women, influencing women from other social strata with their exemplary actions. One hundred and twenty-five families from the Qiqihar No. 2 Machine Tool Plant participated in the great blooming and contending, putting forward 160 opinions in three days, most of which were correct.

    When the Chongqing State-owned Jialing Machinery Factory educated employees' families, in addition to making thorough preparations, repeatedly delivering mobilization reports, and eliminating ideological concerns, it also paid attention to giving play to the organizational role of the family committee, helping the family committee organize two teams, clarifying the division of labor, taking into account both daily work and carrying out socialist education.

    At present, many enterprise leaders still do not attach enough importance to the education of employees' families. Some enterprise party committees rely on the street party committees to carry out the education of employees' families living in concentrated areas in the factory, resulting in the abandonment of leadership, which is detrimental to the rectification of the enterprise. For example, some family members of the Tangshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Railway Repair Plant went to the homes of workers who wrote big-character posters to make a scene when they saw that the big-character posters criticized their husbands. Some technicians and staff actively supported the transfer of cadres to lower levels in the factory and signed up to participate in labor, but because their families disagreed, they publicly backed down. Although these situations were remedied afterwards, they took a detour for the work.

### 家属和职工相互鼓励共同提高  北京等地部分企业向职工家属进行社会主义教育

　　家属和职工相互鼓励共同提高
　  北京等地部分企业向职工家属进行社会主义教育
    本报讯　在整风运动中有计划地向集中居住的职工家属进行社会主义教育，已经在部分厂矿中引起注意，并且取得了良好的效果。
    北京和唐山两地有些国营厂矿企业的党委，在向职工进行社会主义教育的时候，也向家属群众进行了教育；组织职工大鸣大放的时候，也发动家属积极分子向领导人员提意见；在组织职工大辩论的时候，也选择一部分与家属有关的问题到家属群众中去辩论。这样做的结果，许多职工和家属的糊涂思想、错误观念，都在大辩论中同时得到了澄清。北京许多工厂对干部下放，紧缩机构等工作，都在家属中进行了充分的酝酿和讨论。北京石景山钢铁厂、北京国棉一厂和二厂的下放干部，都得到了职工家属有力的支持。
    齐齐哈尔市有些工厂，把职工家属的教育工作放在党委整风办公室的计划之内，由党委统一领导，统一安排。有的厂在整风办公室内设立一个职工家属社会主义教育小组。他们体会到这种统一领导的好处很多：第一、可以动员家属帮助企业整风；第二、可以使家属和职工能互相鼓励，互相提高；第三、可以使家属在一般妇女中起带动作用，以自己的模范行动，影响其它阶层的妇女。齐齐哈尔机床二厂一百二十五户家属参加大鸣大放，三天内提出了一百六十条意见，绝大部分都是正确的。
    重庆国营嘉陵机器厂对职工家属进行教育的时候，除了充分准备、反复作好动员报告、消除思想顾虑而外，还注意到发挥家属委员会的组织作用，帮助家属委员会组织两套班子，明确分工，既照顾到日常工作，又开展了社会主义教育。
    目前，还有不少的企业领导人员对职工家属的教育工作还没有足够的重视，有些企业党委把在工厂集中居住的职工家属教育工作依赖街道党委去做，结果，放弃了领导，对企业的整风不利。如唐山钢铁厂、铁路修理厂有的家属看到大字报上批评了自己的丈夫，就到写大字报的工人家里去大吵大闹，有的技术人员和职员在工厂里积极拥护干部下放，并且报名参加劳动，因为家属不同意，也就当众打了退堂鼓。这些情况，虽然事后做了补救，但对工作来说却走了一段弯路。
