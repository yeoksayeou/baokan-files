Editorial: Guarantee the Smooth Deployment of 500,000 Horsepower of Drainage and Irrigation Machinery to the Countryside

　　The National Conference on Farmland Drainage and Irrigation Machinery and Agricultural Mechanization has delivered inspiring news: In 1958, at least 500,000 horsepower of power machinery will be transported to the countryside. This figure is almost equal to the current total of drainage and irrigation power machinery nationwide.

　　Having 500,000 horsepower of power machinery go to the countryside within a year is an unprecedented feat in China's drainage and irrigation endeavors, and a significant measure to promote the early realization of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). The landscape of our country's water conservancy work will therefore undergo a significant change. It will powerfully promote a nationwide upsurge in farmland water conservancy construction on an unprecedented scale. We can imagine that this machinery will play a huge role in irrigating farmland, drawing water up mountains, transforming dry land into paddy fields, and draining waterlogged areas, providing a strong guarantee for increased grain and cotton production.

　　Having 500,000 horsepower of power machinery go to the countryside within a year is also a leap forward in agricultural technology in our country, which will have a profound impact on changing the backward state of agricultural technology. The most realistic step and the main content of agricultural mechanization in our country at present is to promote farmland drainage and irrigation machinery. Tens of thousands of farmers mastering the technology of operating this batch of power machinery will also create favorable conditions for further implementation of agricultural mechanization in the future.

　　However, it is not a simple matter to ensure that so much power machinery is well-produced, well-supplied, and well-used. In order to ensure the smooth deployment of this 500,000 horsepower of drainage and irrigation machinery to the countryside, all relevant departments need to make significant efforts.

　　For the employees of the machinery industry sector, producing 500,000 horsepower of power machinery to send to the countryside is a glorious task to support the peasant brothers in realizing the Forty Articles for Agricultural Struggle. In order to successfully complete this task, it is necessary to implement the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical," and, on the basis of ensuring quality, complete the production plan on schedule and in quantity.

　　In the past, the output of general factories in the spring was often relatively low. However, the production task of drainage and irrigation machinery in the spring of next year accounts for a large proportion of the whole year, and 200,000 horsepower of power machinery needs to be produced from January to April. This requires the employee comrades to enthusiastically devote themselves to the new high tide of industrial production, fully exert their enthusiasm and creativity, and strive not to miss the farming season and produce a large number of drainage and irrigation machinery in a timely manner. Enterprise leaders need to properly arrange and organize production. The central and provincial/municipal departments concerned also need to strive to ensure the supply of raw materials and collaborative parts, so as to create the necessary conditions for enterprises to smoothly complete their plans.

　　It is not enough to just strive not to miss the farming season. More importantly, it is necessary to implement the technical conditions formulated by the conference and earnestly ensure product quality. If the product quality is poor and cannot be used during the tense drainage and irrigation season, or if there are many problems during use, then what is lost is definitely not the value of a machine, but rather it hinders the completion of the task of increasing grain and cotton production in the vast countryside, and it will affect the confidence of farmers in using machinery in the future. Some people think that since it is so urgent and the quantity is so large, it seems that the quality standards can be lowered a bit. This idea of "not washing the mud off the radishes because they are pulled out quickly" is absolutely unacceptable. The Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Factory supplied 1,336 gas engines to eighteen provinces, but because the product structure was unreasonable and the manufacturing quality was poor, 834 units have already been requested to be returned by the user units. Therefore, I hope that the employee comrades in the industrial sector must ensure: Every machine made must be guaranteed to be worth its use.

　　After 500,000 horsepower of power machinery goes to the countryside, approximately 100,000 operators will be needed. The number of drivers trained by various provinces now is far from meeting this need. In particular, the development of drainage and irrigation machinery in 1958 will focus on gas engines, but rural areas in various parts of our country generally lack experience in using gas engines. Past experiences in various places have shown that in order to give full play to the role of agricultural machinery, it is necessary to do a good job in training machinery operators in advance. In Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, due to the serious personnel training work, only one of the 28 gas engines had problems in use; in Xinxiang Prefecture, because this work was neglected, only nine of the 30 gas engines could operate normally. This is a clear contrast. Therefore, the water conservancy departments of each province and city should immediately take action to absorb rural demobilized soldiers, transferred cadres, and young students participating in agricultural production, and hold a large number of training courses to train personnel to use drainage and irrigation machinery on the spot. Factories that produce power machinery should actively assist in terms of teachers and teaching materials. In addition to teaching basic knowledge about operation and maintenance, the training course should also have sufficient on-site operation time, so that students can master the techniques of operation, disassembly, maintenance, and repair of general failures. In order to speed up the training of machinery operators, provinces and cities can first train teachers, and then run training courses at all levels; or the water conservancy department can send personnel to factories and pumping stations for internships, and conduct training using the method of master teaching apprentice.

　　The work of supplying complete sets of machinery is also very important. In addition to arranging production in complete sets, the supply department needs to pay more attention to specifically organizing the supply of power machinery with water pumps, transmission belts, and other equipment in complete sets according to the usage in various places. While actively trying to quickly supply machinery, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels should conscientiously take on the task of supplying complete sets.

　　The matter is not over when the machinery goes to the countryside. What is most needed at that time is to establish a timely repair system. If this work is not well organized, the machinery will often be forced to stop working due to a small malfunction. In establishing a repair system, the following things need to be done: Under the unified arrangement of the local Party and government, fully organize and utilize the existing repair forces, expand the repair scope of automobile repair shops, tractor repair stations, farm tool repair stations, and handicraft cooperatives, so that they can comprehensively repair various types of machinery; mobilize state-owned and local industrial departments and non-industrial departments' repair workshops to actively participate in the repair work without affecting their own tasks; gradually establish a rural machinery repair network, so that they can carry out minor repairs, medium repairs, and supply of accessories on the spot. Faced with tens of thousands of drainage and irrigation machines used by tens of thousands of agricultural cooperatives scattered across the countryside, it is impossible to do without a large and in-depth repair force in the countryside.

　　Now the time is very tight. It is hoped that the relevant departments will be mobilized urgently, cooperate closely, and jointly complete this glorious and arduous task.

### 保证五十万马力排水灌溉机械顺利下乡

　　保证五十万马力排水灌溉机械顺利下乡
    全国农田排灌机械及农业机械化会议传出振奋人心的消息：1958年至少将有五十万马力的动力机械运往农村。这个数字几乎等于目前全国排水灌溉动力机械的总和。
    一年内有五十万马力的动力机械下乡，是我国排水灌溉事业上空前的壮举，也是促进全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）早日实现的一个重大措施。我国水利工作的面貌因此将有显著的改变。它将有力地促进全国农村掀起一个规模空前的兴修水利的高潮。我们可以想见，这些机械对于灌溉农田、引水上山、变旱地为水田、排泄内涝地区积水，将发挥巨大的作用，粮棉增产将会得到有力的保证。
    一年内有五十万马力的动力机械下乡，也是我国农业技术上的一个跃进，对于改变农业技术落后状况将有深远的影响。当前我国农业机械化的最现实的步骤、最主要的内容，就是推广农田排水灌溉机械。成千上万的农民掌握了操纵这批动力机械的技术，也就为今后进一步推行农业机械化创造了有利的条件。
    但是，要使这么多的动力机械生产好、供应好、使用好，却不是一件简单的事情。为了使这五十万马力的排水灌溉机械顺利下乡，各个有关部门都需要作一番重大的努力。
    对于机械工业部门的职工来说，生产五十万马力的动力机械送往农村，是支援农民兄弟实现四十条农业斗争纲领的光荣任务。为了胜利完成这一任务，就要贯彻多快好省的方针，在保证质量的基础上，如期、如数地完成生产计划。
    过去，一般工厂每年春季的产量往往是比较低的。明年春季排水灌溉机械的生产任务却占了全年较大的比重，在1至4月份就需要生产出二十万马力的动力机械。这就需要职工同志们热烈地投入新的工业生产高潮，充分发挥积极性和创造性，争取不误农时，及时把大批排水灌溉机械生产出来。企业的领导人员需要妥善地安排和组织生产。中央和省、市有关部门也需要努力保证原材料、协作件的供应，为企业顺利完成计划创造必要的条件。
    仅仅争取不误农时还不够，更重要的是要贯彻执行会议制定的技术条件，切实保证产品质量。如果产品质量低劣，到紧张的排水灌溉季节不能使用，或者使用时毛病百出，那末，受损失的就决不是一台机器的价值，而是妨碍广大农村粮棉增产任务的完成，并且会影响今后农民使用机械的信心。有人认为，既然要得这么急，数量又这么多，似乎可以把质量标准降低一些。这种“萝卜快了不洗泥”的想法是十分要不得的。天津内燃机厂供应给十八个省的一千三百三十六台煤气机，因为产品结构不合理，制造质量低劣，已经有八百三十四台被使用单位要求退货。因此希望工业部门的职工同志们一定要做到：造一台机器就要保证顶一台用。
    五十万马力的动力机械下乡以后，约需十万名左右的使用人员。现在各省训练的司机数量远不能适应这一需要。特别是1958年发展排水灌溉机械以煤气机为主，而我国各地农村一般都还缺乏使用煤气机的经验。过去各地的经验说明，要使农业机械充分发挥作用，必须事先作好训练机械使用人员的工作。河南省许昌专区由于认真进行了人员训练工作，二十八台煤气机只有一台在使用中发生问题；新乡专区因为忽视了这项工作，三十台煤气机中能正常运转的只有九台。这就是一个鲜明的对比。因此，各省、市水利部门应该立即行动起来，吸收农村的转业军人、下放干部和参加农业生产的青年学生等，大量举办训练班，就地训练使用排水灌溉机械的人员。生产动力机械的工厂应该在师资、教材等方面积极加以协助。训练班除了教授关于操作、维修的基本知识以外，还要有足够的实地操作时间，以便使学员能够掌握操作、拆卸、维护以及修理一般故障的技术。为了加速训练机械使用人员，还可以由省、市先训练教员，然后逐级开办训练班；或者由水利部门派遣人员到工厂和抽水机站实习，用师傅带徒弟的方法进行训练。
    机械配套供应工作也很重要。除了布置生产应该成套以外，供应部门更需要注意根据各地的使用情况，具体组织动力机械同水泵、传动带以及其他器材的配套供应。各级供销合作社在积极设法迅速供应机械的同时，应该认真把配套供应任务担负起来。
    机械下了乡，事情还没有完。到那时最需要的是及时建立修理系统。这一工作组织不好，往往会使机械发生一点小故障便被迫停工。在建立修理系统方面，需要作这样几件事：在当地党政统一安排下，充分组织和利用现有的修理力量，扩大汽车修理厂、拖拉机修理站、农具修理站、手工业合作社等的修理范围，使它们能综合修理各种机械；动员国营和地方工业部门以及非工业部门的修理车间，在不影响本身任务的情况下，积极参加修理工作；逐步建立农村机械修理网，使它们能就地进行小修、中修和配件的供应。面对着几万个农业合作社分散使用的千万台排水灌溉机械，没有广大的、深入到农村的修理力量是不行的。
    现在时间已很紧迫。希望各有关部门紧张动员起来，密切协作，共同来完成这一光荣而艰巨的任务。
