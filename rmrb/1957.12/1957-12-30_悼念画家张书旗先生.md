In Memory of Painter Zhang Shuqi
Ai Zhongxin

　　The sad news came from across the Pacific that the Chinese painter Zhang Shuqi unfortunately passed away in San Francisco, USA, on August 18 of this year due to stomach cancer. Mr. Shuqi was my teacher. By the Jialing River, we spent day and night together. What happened eighteen years ago is still vivid in my mind.

　　Mr. Shuqi, a native of Pujiang, Zhejiang, specialized in flowers, birds, and feathers. In his early years, he followed the style of Ren Bonian. Whenever he obtained authentic works, he would repeatedly copy and study them. His copies were so good that they could almost be mistaken for the real thing. Through careful copying, he absorbed the excellent techniques of his predecessors. At the same time, he diligently sketched from life, drawing inspiration from nature, and mastered the ability to represent objects accurately. Therefore, his art did not fall into clichés and had its own unique features. His modeling tended towards simplicity, and his coloring aimed for brilliance. In terms of artistic conception and flavor, his work may have seemed slightly less refined, but it possessed a fresh and lively atmosphere. Critics often saw this as a shortcoming, while the audience generally appreciated it. The characteristic of his art was that it was less about pursuing antiquity and more about approaching the people. This style, which appealed to both refined and popular tastes, was the reason why his works were widely circulated and loved.

　　I particularly liked his paintings of broad bean flowers. Very few people have ever painted broad bean flowers. Every time the broad bean flowers bloom, I think of Mr. Shuqi. What saddens me is that I have never received any news from him since we parted ways. When the news finally arrived, it was to say that he had passed away. From 1941 until now, Mr. Shuqi resided in the United States for a long period of time. His art was very popular among the local overseas Chinese. In recent years, he fell ill and knew that he would not recover. He compiled his paintings from over the years into a book of feathers and birds, but the flower album could not be completed. Before his death, he wrote to a friend in China saying, "I regret infinitely that I could not see the prosperous and flourishing liberated motherland." "What I am most concerned about is that the motherland's future is infinitely bright and becoming increasingly prosperous and strong. I fear I will not be able to witness it, and I have not been able to contribute to the people and the motherland. I am afraid I am dying too early." This shows his ardent love for the motherland.

　　Mr. Shuqi did not return to China early enough, and he ultimately failed to see the vigorous scene of New China, which became a lifelong regret. Friends in the domestic art circle are fully capable of understanding his regretful state of mind and offering their sympathy. Only those who personally participate in the great socialist construction can truly appreciate the joy and excitement of living in the liberated motherland, and therefore can deeply understand Mr. Shuqi's infinite regret.

    悼念画家张书旗先生
    艾中信
    从太平洋彼岸传来噩耗，国画家张书旗不幸于今年8月18日以胃癌不治，在美国旧金山逝世。书旗先生是我的老师，嘉陵江边，我们曾朝夕相处，十八年前往事，至今历历在目。
    书旗先生，浙江浦江人，工花卉翎毛。在他的早年，宗法任伯年，每得真迹，必反复临摹研习，其临本几能乱真。从精心的临摹，他接受了前人的优秀技巧，同时他又刻苦写生，取法于自然，掌握了应物象形的能力，所以他的艺术能不落窠臼而有独到之处。造型宁趋平易，设色务求绚丽，论意境风味，其淡雅似觉稍逊，却别有新鲜活泼的气息；论者莫不以为憾，而观众莫不以为喜。他的艺术特征，与其说失之高古，还不如说接近人民，这种雅俗共赏的风格是使得作品广泛流传为人们所喜爱的原因。
    我最喜他所作蚕豆花，从来很少有人画蚕豆花；每当蚕豆花开，我就想起书旗先生。使我黯然的是别来从未得到消息；待消息传来，却说人已作古。自1941年至今，书旗先生长时期旅居美国，其艺术颇受当地侨胞欢迎。年来患病，自知不起，乃抱病编纂其历年画稿成翎毛一册，花卉册竟未能完成。他在去世前，曾致书国内友人说：“解放了的祖国繁荣旺盛，未能一睹，遗憾无穷”“所耿耿者，祖国前途无限光明，日臻富强，恐难目睹，又未能为人民祖国尽一分力量，未免死得太早耳”，可以概见他对祖国热烈的眷恋。
    书旗先生没有及早回国，终于不能看到新中国的蓬勃景象，而成为终身憾事。国内美术界的朋友们是完全能够了解他的悔恨的心境而寄与同情的。只有亲身参与伟大社会主义建设的人们才能真正体会到生活在解放了的祖国的愉快和兴奋，因此也能深刻的体会到书旗先生的无穷遗恨。
