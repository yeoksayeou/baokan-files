　　Sisters-in-Law Reconcile
　　Wang Chuangji
    Last night at our village's debate meeting, we refuted Zheng Caiwa, who had speculated and resold 2,000 jin of grain; and we reconciled Lan Cao and Shu Xian, two sisters-in-law. This reconciliation between the two sisters-in-law was truly an unexpected gain for us.
    For about half a year, although they ate from the same pot and sometimes carried a bucket of water together, they didn't speak to each other, nor did they look at each other directly. What was the reason? Even the village's biggest gossip couldn't say for sure.
    As the debate meeting was proceeding heatedly, unexpectedly, Lan Cao, who was usually stubborn, aloof, and rarely spoke to people, suddenly shouted in a loud voice:
    "Captain, I want to speak!"
    She was so excited that her face was flushed and her voice trembled:
    "Sister-in-law, I ask you, how many jin of wheat did you and your husband sell to Caiwa? Why haven't you confessed yet?"
    Shu Xian never expected that at a time when all eyes were on Caiwa, her sister-in-law would suddenly strike her like a thunderclap. Her face suddenly turned pale and she became embarrassingly awkward. At this time, everyone in the audience was watching this usually quiet and gentle daughter-in-law. After a long while, she finally spoke:
    "Sister-in-law, are you... asking me?"
    "Yes, I'm asking you, you must speak truthfully."
    Shu Xian seemed to wake up suddenly from a daze. She said sternly:
    "I swear in front of everyone in the village: If I have ever stolen a single grain from home, I am not human!..."
    Lan Cao felt a sharp pain in her heart upon hearing these words. She grabbed Caiwa's chest and roared hoarsely:
    "Did you hear that? In February and March, you took out a sack from my house and said it was used by my brother's wife and her husband when they secretly sold grain to you. What are you up to?"
    Only then did people understand that the two sisters-in-law had become enemies because of this.
    Caiwa, unable to argue his way out, finally admitted:
    "This spring, in order to get grain to sell, I stole a sack from her house and fabricated those words to deceive Lan Cao into believing it. She was afraid of being at a disadvantage during the division of the family property, so she stole 150 jin of wheat from home three times and sold it to me..."
    Shu Xian hurriedly said before Caiwa could finish:
    "I know, my sister-in-law was originally a good person, she was deceived by you, Caiwa. Everyone, see how poisonous this capitalist weed, Caiwa, is!"
    There was a buzz of discussion in the crowd, expressing agreement with Shu Xian's words. Shu Xian's husband also stood up and said:
    "Sister-in-law, don't be sad. You did a good thing at the debate meeting. From now on, you two sisters-in-law should reconcile."
    Lan Cao grabbed Shu Xian's arms, her eyes filled with tears, unable to speak...

### 妯娌和好

　　妯娌和好
　　王创基
    昨晚我们村的辩论会上，驳倒了投机倒把卖粮两千斤的郑财娃；和好了兰草和淑贤两妯娌。这妯娌俩的和好，真是我们意外的收获。
    大概半年多了，她俩虽然在一个锅里吃饭，有时还同抬一桶水；可是互相不说话，也不正眼地瞧一下。是什么原因呢？连村里最爱小广播的人也说不出个究竟来。
    辩论会正进行得热烈的时候，没有想到那个性情执拗孤癖、见人很少说话的兰草忽然高喉咙大嗓门地喊道：
    “队长，我发言！”
    她激动得满脸通红说话颤慄：
    “娃他婶，我问你，你和你男人卖给了财娃多少斤麦子，为啥还不坦白？”
    淑贤万没想到正是众目睽睽矛头指向财娃的时候，嫂子会突然像一声迅雷朝她击来。她骤然脸色泛白、茫茫尴尬起来。这时全场人都注视着这个平时娴静温和的媳妇，好一会功夫她才说出话来：
    “嫂嫂，你……是问我吗？”
    “是问你，你得说良心话。”
    淑贤像从昏迷中猛醒过来，她声色俱厉地说：
    “我当着全村人的面赌咒：我要是偷过家里一颗粮食，我就不是人！……”
    兰草听了这话心里一阵刺疼，她一把抓住财娃的胸襟嘶哑地吼道：
    “你听见了没有？你二、三月拿出我家一条口袋说那是我兄弟媳妇两口偷偷糶给你粮食时用的。说他们存心要分家，你这是捣什么鬼？”
    人们这才明白两妯娌成冤家，原来是因为这么回事。
    财娃狡辩不过去，才承认了：
    “今春为弄到粮食贩卖，我偷了她家一条口袋，捏造了那些话骗得兰草相信了。她怕分家时吃亏，便三次从家里偷出一百五十斤小麦卖给我……。”
    淑贤没等财娃说完便急急地说：
    “我知道，我嫂嫂原是个好人，她是被你财娃哄坏了的。大伙看财娃这根资本主义的草多毒啊！”
    人群里一阵纷纷议论，表示赞成淑贤的话。淑贤的丈夫也站起来说：
    “嫂嫂，不要难过，你在辩论会上做了一件好事，从此，你们妯娌俩该和好了。”
    兰草一把拉住淑贤的双臂，两眼泪汪汪地说不出话来……。
