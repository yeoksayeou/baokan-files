　　Why Does Soda Ash Turn to Powder Over Time?

　　The chemical composition of household soda ash is sodium carbonate containing ten molecules of crystal water. In the air, it can automatically lose its crystal water and turn into powdered anhydrous sodium carbonate. This phenomenon is called weathering in chemistry. The way to prevent it from turning into powder is to isolate it from the air and put it in a bottle or earthenware jar and seal it tightly. However, whether sodium carbonate contains crystal water or not has little effect on steaming馒头 (mantou, steamed buns) or washing clothes, so even if it is soda ash powder, it doesn't matter much.

　　碱块放久了为什么会变成粉末
    家用碱块的化学成份是含有十个分子结晶水的碳酸钠。它在空气中可以自动的丢去结晶水，而变成没有结晶水的粉末状碳酸钠。这种现象在化学上叫作风化作用。防止它变成粉末的方法，就是使它与空气隔绝，把它放在一个瓶子或陶罐内盖严就行了。不过碳酸钠含不含结晶水，对我们蒸馒头或洗衣服等影响不大，所以即或是碱末也没有多大关系。　（单）
