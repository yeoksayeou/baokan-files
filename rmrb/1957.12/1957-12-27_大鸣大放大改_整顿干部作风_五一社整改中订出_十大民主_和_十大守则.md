Great Exhortation, Great Airing of Views, Great Transformation: Rectifying Cadre Work Style
"Ten Democractic Rights" and "Ten Rules of Conduct" Formulated During the Rectification in the "May First" Cooperative

(Our report) According to the *Liaoning Daily*, the "May First" Agricultural Cooperative in Fuyu Township, Gaiping County, mobilized its members to greatly exhort and air their views, conducting a serious review and rectification of the work style of cooperative cadres and formulating ten rules of conduct for cadres, thereby strengthening the relationship with the masses.

The "May First" Cooperative used the method of great exhortation and airing of views to rectify the work style of cadres. Initially, both members and cadres had many concerns. In order to enable members to speak freely, cadres expressed their willingness to listen to criticism in front of the members. Subsequently, various forms such as large meetings for airing views, small discussion groups, individual heart-to-heart talks, and door-to-door visits were used to mobilize members to "speak their minds." After several days, members raised a total of one hundred and twenty-six opinions to the cadres, of which thirty-eight related to work style, sixty-seven related to production management, and twenty-one related to handling general affairs. Members criticized the cooperative director for not paying attention to livestock breeding, resulting in the death of twenty-seven animals in two years. They criticized the Party branch secretary for taking advantage of the cooperative by taking planks home for personal use.

After the members greatly exhorted and aired their views, the cadres' thinking was relatively confused. Some complained and expressed dissatisfaction behind their backs. The Party branch promptly convened an enlarged meeting to educate cadres to have a correct attitude towards the criticism from the masses. Finally, each opinion raised by the masses was analyzed and studied one by one. The results showed that out of the one hundred and twenty-six opinions, sixty-four were correct, accounting for 50.7%; fifty-five were doubtful or misunderstandings requiring verification, accounting for 44%; and only seven were malicious attacks, accounting for 5.3%. After this analysis, many cadres realized their shortcomings and launched criticism and self-criticism. Strict criticism and education were carried out on those cadres whose mistakes were serious and who were not clearly aware of them. The cooperative accountant said: "It seems that it is not that the masses have no conscience, but that we really have shortcomings and should make a self-criticism to the masses." The Party branch and the cooperative management committee classified and sorted the members' opinions, formulated rectification plans for some problems that could not be solved immediately, and proposed rectification methods for the problems that could be solved and that the members were most concerned about, and communicated these to the members in various forms. At the same time, the verification team established by the members reported the results of the account verification to the members based on the members' doubts about the accounts.

As a result of the "May First" Cooperative's actions, not only were right and wrong distinguished, but the cadres were also relieved of their burdens. Seeing that the cadres seriously examined their shortcomings, the members also automatically made self-criticisms.

On the basis of the improved relationship between cadres and the masses, the adjustment of cadres and the election of new cooperative leadership institutions began. In order to do a good job in the election, a concentrated and democratic education was carried out among the members and cadres. At that time, after the great exhortation and airing of views, some members were still afraid that the cadres would not be willing to be democratic in the future and feared retaliation; some cadres were also afraid that the members would be difficult to lead in the future and that it would be difficult to handle affairs if they talked about democracy. In light of this situation, the cadres discussed: What is democracy under leadership? Is it good to talk about democracy to get things done? The members discussed: Do we need leadership after the cooperative is rectified? What if the cadres are afraid that the members are difficult to lead? What is the relationship between the members and the cooperative and the cooperative cadres? After discussion, the cadres realized that running the cooperative well must rely on the masses, and they cannot stand above the masses. They must discuss everything with the masses. Similarly, the masses also realized that people cannot walk without a head, and birds cannot fly without a head. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, socialism cannot be built. Without cadres, the cooperative cannot do a good job in production. On this basis, the members put forward four criteria for electing cadres: resolutely support socialism, be able to conscientiously implement the Party's line and policies; be active in work and have a certain leadership ability; be fair in handling affairs and have a democratic style; love labor and have certain production experience. As a result of the election, out of the fifteen cooperative and team cadres in the whole cooperative, only three were not re-elected because their mistakes were relatively serious and their determination to correct them was not great, while the remaining twelve were re-elected.

After the election, discussions on "How to be a good cadre" and "How to be a good member" were launched among the cadres and the masses respectively. After repeated discussions, the cadres formulated "Ten Democratic Rights" and "Ten Rules of Conduct for Cadres." The members formulated "Ten Rules of Conduct for Members" to express their attitudes to each other and make promises to each other. The relationship between cadres and the masses became closer.

The "Ten Democratic Rights" for cadres are: democratic planning; democratic technology; democratic business management; democratic quotas; democratic "three guarantees"; democratic labor planning; democratic finance; democratic distribution; democratic rewards and punishments; democratic re-election of cadres. The "Ten Rules of Conduct" for cadres are: serve the masses wholeheartedly and run the cooperative diligently; overcome departmentalism and establish collectivist ideology; promote democracy and discuss things with the masses; work must be done in accordance with the cooperative's charter and resolutely implement the resolutions of the management committee and the members' representative assembly; actively participate in labor and cultivate the concept of loving the country, loving the cooperative, loving the family, and loving labor; do not embezzle, do not use public funds, and do not take advantage of the cooperative; cultivate the habit of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily and managing the family diligently and thriftily; care about the hardships of the masses and solve the difficulties of the masses in life and production in a timely manner; be fair in handling affairs and vigorously carry out criticism and self-criticism; strengthen learning and constantly improve ideological awareness and the ability to run the cooperative.

Through this rectification of cadre work style, the "May First" Cooperative greatly improved the awareness and leadership level of the cooperative cadres. Many cooperative cadres seriously participated in production and leadership production. Some cadres worked more than twenty working days in the month of rectification, which was more than they did in the past three months.

    大鸣大放大改　整顿干部作风
    五一社整改中订出“十大民主”和“十大守则”
    本报讯　据辽宁日报报道：盖平县富裕乡五一农业合作社发动社员群众大鸣大放，对社干部工作作风进行了一次认真的检查和整顿，制定了干部十项守则，密切了与群众的关系。
    五一社用大鸣大放方法整顿干部作风。开始时无论是社员或干部都有许多顾虑。为了能使社员畅所欲言，干部都当着社员表示了听取批评的态度。随后用大会鸣放，小会座谈，个别谈心，登门访问等多种形式，发动社员“说心里话”。这样经过几天之后，社员共给干部提出了一百二十六条意见，其中属于作风方面的有三十八条，属于生产管理方面的有六十七条，属于处理一般事务的有二十一条。社员批评社主任对牲畜饲养工作不重视，两年来死了二十七头牲口。批评支部书记占社的便宜，往家里私自拿板子。
    社员大鸣大放后，干部的思想是比较混乱的，有的背后发牢骚，表示不满。党支部及时召开了扩大会议，教育干部对群众批评要有正确态度，最后又对群众所提出的意见逐条地进行分析研究，结果证明在一百二十六条意见中，正确的有六十四条，占50.7％，怀疑或误解须查证的有五十五条，占44％，属于恶意攻击的只有七条，占5.3％。经过这样分析以后，许多干部认识到自己的缺点，展开了批评和自我批评，对那些错误严重而又认识不清的干部进行了严格的批评教育。社会计说：看来不是群众没良心，而是我们真有缺点，应该向群众检讨。党支部和社管委会根据社员意见进行了分类排队，对一些不能马上解决的问题制定了改正方案，对能够解决的、社员最关心的问题，提出了改正办法，运用各种形式向社员交代。与此同时，由社员成立的查对组，根据社员对账目怀疑的问题，把查对的结果向社员作了报告。
    五一社这样作的结果，不仅分清了是非，而且也使社干部放下了包袱，社员看到干部严肃地检查了自己的缺点，也自动地作了自我批评。
    在干群关系已经有了改善的基础上，开始调整干部，选举新的社领导机构。为了作好选举工作，在社员和干部中进行了一次集中与民主的教育。当时经过大鸣大放后，有的社员还怕干部今后不肯讲民主，怕打击报复；在干部中也怕今后社员不好领导，怕讲民主不好办事等顾虑。根据这种情况，在干部中讨论：什么是有领导的民主？讲民主好不好办事？在社员中讨论：整社后要不要领导？干部怕社员不好领导怎么办？社员同社、社干部是什么关系？经过讨论，干部认识到办好社必须依靠群众，不能站在群众之上，有事一定得和群众商量；同样群众也认识到，人无头不走、鸟无头不飞，没有共产党领导就不能建设社会主义，合作社没有干部就搞不好生产。在这个基础上，社员提出四项选举干部的标准：坚决拥护社会主义，能认真贯彻执行党的方针政策；工作积极，并有一定领导能力；办事公道，作风民主；热爱劳动，有一定生产经验的人。选举的结果，全社十五名社队干部，只有三名因错误比较严重，改正决心不大因而落选以外，其余十二名都连选连任。
    选举后，又分别在干部和群众中展开“如何当个好干部”和“如何当个好社员”的讨论。经过反复讨论，干部订了“十大民主”和“干部十大守则”。社员订了“社员十大守则”互相表示态度，彼此提出保证，干部和群众之间的关系更加密切了。
    干部的“十大民主”是：计划民主；技术民主；经营管理民主；定额民主；“三包”民主；劳动规划民主；财务民主；分配民主；奖惩民主；改选干部民主。干部的“十大守则”是：全心全意为群众服务，兢兢业业办好合作社；克服本位主义，树立集体主义思想；发扬民主，有事与群众商量；工作必须按社章办事，坚决贯彻执行管委会、社员代表大会决议；积极参加劳动，养成爱国、爱社、爱家、爱劳动的观念；不贪污，不占用公款，不占社的便宜；要养成勤俭办社，勤俭持家的风气；关心群众疾苦，及时解决群众生活和生产中的困难；办事公道，大力开展批评与自我批评；加强学习，不断提高思想觉悟和办社能力。
    五一社通过这次整顿干部作风，大大地提高了社干部觉悟和领导水平，许多社干部做到了认真参加生产领导生产。有些干部在整社的一个月作了二十多个工作日，比过去三个月作的还多。
