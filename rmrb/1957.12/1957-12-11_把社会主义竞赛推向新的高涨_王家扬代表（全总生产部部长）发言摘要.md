The experience of the past four years tells us that under the leadership of the Party, trade union organizations continuously enhance the awareness and organizational level of the working masses, mobilize and organize them to carry out socialist emulation campaigns and advanced producer movements. This is a fundamental method for realizing the Party's policy of building the country diligently and frugally, running enterprises diligently and frugally, and handling all undertakings diligently and frugally, fulfilling and overfulfilling national plans, and it is also the regular central task of trade union organizations. We must conscientiously adhere to and apply the basic experience of socialist emulation in practical work, and through the rectification movement, push the socialist emulation to a new height.

During the rectification movement, in many factories and mines, after extensive airing of views, debates, and discussions, the political awareness of the broad masses of workers has been greatly improved, and their labor enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly high; labor discipline has been greatly strengthened, and phenomena such as disobedience to production commands, violation of operating procedures, and lateness and early departure have been greatly reduced. A large number of rationalization proposals have been put forward, new records have been continuously achieved, labor productivity has been significantly improved, and a large number of new advanced producers and advanced collectives have emerged, enabling many units to excellently complete the national plan.

The Northwest No. 2 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory put forward 207 rationalization proposals in 25 days in November. The six rationalization proposals put forward by the employees of Dalian Shipyard aimed at key production problems have created more than 22,000 yuan of wealth for the state. The No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel produced 379 new records of rapid steelmaking in October. Since the launch of the rectification movement in 18 coal mines in Shanxi Province, production tasks have been increasing month by month, and the Datong and Xishan coal mines, which have always been backward, have undergone fundamental changes. Facts show that a new upsurge in production and construction is beginning to emerge.

The new production upsurge will not arise all at once, but will take shape with the in-depth development of the rectification movement. The general rule is that the more fully the masses are mobilized, the more thoroughly the views are aired, and the more vigorously the work is improved, the higher the enthusiasm of the workers will be. Therefore, trade union organizations must, under the leadership of the Party, carry out the rectification movement to the end, and through the rectification movement, invigorate the democratic life of enterprises and vigorously improve work. The experience of many units proves that rectification work does not only rely on a few leading cadres, but more importantly, it mobilizes and organizes the workers and leading cadres to solve problems together. In the rectification movement, the masses have drawn a good conclusion based on their own experience: "We are not afraid of problems and key issues, but only afraid that the leaders do not follow the mass line." Only by combining the leadership with the masses and implementing the Party's mass line can all problems be effectively solved. Methods such as big-character posters, debates, group meetings, production meetings, and technical research meetings are all good methods for concentrating the wisdom of the masses, pooling efforts, improving work, and running enterprises well.

Due to the different times when rectification began in various regions and units, and the different specific conditions, the formation of the production upsurge will vary. Generally, it is led by a few advanced workers, gradually becoming a mass movement of the majority; promoted by a few relatively advanced departments and units, and then forming an upsurge in the entire enterprise or region. The development of the movement is always from the few to the many, from the local to the whole. Therefore, trade union organizations must coordinate with the enterprise administration to summarize and disseminate the experiences of advanced units and advanced regions; be good at using typical examples to promote the overall situation, and from the innovative achievements in production, initiate a comprehensive production upsurge. At present, many enterprise leaders are doing just that, thereby promoting the rapid arrival of the production upsurge. Any neglect of the innovations of the masses and any neglect of support for emerging things will hinder the development of production and the progress of enterprises. The experience of organizing socialist emulation campaigns over the past few years tells us that there is a consolidation process from the discovery of advanced experience to the summarization and promotion of advanced experience. In the process of promotion, advanced experience will continue to develop and improve. On the new basis, continue to discover, summarize, promote, consolidate, rediscover, resummarize, repromote, and reconsolidate. This is a cyclical process, which is the process of continuous improvement of labor productivity.

Accompanying the production upsurge, a large number of rationalization proposals will inevitably emerge. Therefore, improving the work of rationalization proposals, timely handling the rationalization proposals put forward by the masses, and giving rewards in accordance with national regulations are of great significance for further encouraging the labor enthusiasm of the working masses and solving key production problems.

During the rectification movement, many old workers played a significant role in improving enterprise management, solving key production problems, discussing the relationship between developing production and improving life, the relationship between national interests and personal interests, the relationship between promoting democracy and observing labor discipline, and the relationship between workers and farmers. In the future, we still need to continue to attach importance to giving full play to the role of old workers.

Organize various competition activities through various means according to production needs. The "Five Goods" competition launched in Shenyang during the production upsurge, the advanced team competition in Tianjin, the quality improvement competition in the construction system, etc., are all good. All regions and enterprises should organize competitions in forms that the masses like, according to their own conditions. Holding advanced producer representative meetings plays a significant role in promoting the development of the competition. Therefore, all enterprises should, according to their specific circumstances, form a system of holding advanced producer representative meetings regularly and persist in it.

Comrades, as long as we carry out the rectification movement that is currently underway to the end under the leadership of the Party, the labor enthusiasm of the workers will inevitably be higher. Vigorously rectify work, earnestly summarize and absorb our own experiences and lessons, strengthen the specific organization and leadership of the competition, utilize all favorable factors, and eliminate various obstacles, a new production upsurge will surely come.

　　把社会主义竞赛推向新的高涨
    王家扬代表（全总生产部部长）发言摘要
    四年来的经验告诉我们：工会组织在党的领导下，不断地提高职工群众的觉悟程度和组织程度，动员和组织职工群众开展社会主义竞赛，开展先进生产者运动，是发挥广大职工群众的积极性和创造性实现党的勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业的方针，完成和超额完成国家计划的根本方法，也是工会组织的经常的中心任务。我们必须认真地在实际工作中，坚持和运用社会主义竞赛的基本经验，通过整风运动，把社会主义竞赛推向新的高涨。
    在整风运动中，许多厂矿企业，经过大鸣大放、大争大辩，广大职工的政治觉悟大大提高，劳动热情空前高涨；劳动纪律大大增强，不服从生产指挥、违犯操作规程、迟到早退等现象大大减少。合理化建议大量增加，新纪录不断出现，劳动生产率显著提高，涌现出大量新的先进生产者和先进集体，使许多单位出色地完成了国家计划。
    国营西北第二棉纺厂在11月的25天内就提出了207件合理化建议。大连造船公司职工针对生产关键提出的六件合理化建议，就为国家创造出二万二千多元的财富。鞍钢第一炼钢厂10月份就创造了379次快速炼钢的新纪录。山西省18个煤矿开展整风以来，生产任务月月上升，过去历来落后的大同、西山煤矿已经有了根本转变。事实表明，一个新的生产建设高潮正在开始出现。
    新的生产高潮不会是一轰而起的，它将随着整风的深入发展而形成。一般的规律是：群众发动得充分，鸣放得彻底，狠狠地改进工作，职工群众的积极性就会高涨起来。因此，工会组织就必须在党的领导下，把整风运动进行到底，通过整风运动，活跃企业的民主生活，狠狠地改进工作。不少单位的经验证明：整改工作不仅仅依靠少数领导干部去做，更重要的是发动和组织职工群众和领导干部共同来解决问题。在整风运动中，群众根据自己的亲身体验得出一个很好的结论：“不怕问题和关键，只怕领导不走群众路线”。只有领导和群众相结合，贯彻执行党的群众路线，才能有效地解决一切问题。大字报、辩论会、小组会、生产会议以及技术研究会等方法，都是集中群众智慧，群策群力，改进工作，办好企业的好方法。
    由于各地、各单位整风开始早晚不同，具体条件不同，生产高潮形成的早晚将会不同。一般的是由少数先进工人带头，逐渐变成多数人的群众运动；由少数较为先进的部门和单位的推动，而后形成整个企业或地区的高潮。运动的发展总是从少数到多数，从局部到全体。因此，工会组织就必须协同企业行政，很好地总结、传播先进单位和先进地区的经验；善于运用典型推动全盘，从点点滴滴的生产上的创举掀起全面的生产高潮。目前不少企业的领导人，正是这样做了。因而，推动了生产高潮的迅速到来。任何忽视群众的创举，忽视对新生事物的支持，都会阻碍着生产的发展和企业的进步。几年来组织社会主义竞赛的经验告诉我们，从发现先进经验到总结推广先进经验，有一个巩固的过程，在推广过程中，先进经验又会不断的发展和完善。在新的基础上继续发现、总结、推广、巩固，再发现、再总结、再推广、再巩固，这是一个循环的过程，也就是劳动生产率不断提高的过程。
    伴随着生产高潮而来的，必然会涌现出大量的合理化建议。因此，改进合理化建议工作，及时处理群众提出来的合理化建议，并且按照国家规定给予奖励，这对进一步鼓舞职工群众的劳动热情解决生产关键有着重要的意义。
    在整风运动中，许多老工人对于改进企业管理、解决生产关键，讨论发展生产与改善生活的关系、国家利益和个人利益的关系、发扬民主和遵守劳动纪律的关系、工人和农民的关系等问题的自我教育中，发挥了重大作用。今后，我们仍需要继续重视发挥老工人的作用。
    根据生产需要，通过多种多样的办法，组织各种竞赛活动。沈阳市在生产高潮中开展的五好竞赛，天津的先进小组竞赛，建筑系统中的提高质量竞赛等等，都是好的。各地区、各企业都应该根据自己的情况，采取群众所喜爱的形式，来组织竞赛。开好先进生产者代表会议，对于推动竞赛的发展有着重大作用。因此，各企业都应该根据自己的具体情况，把定期召开先进生产者代表会议形成制度，坚持下去。
    同志们，只要我们在党的领导下，把目前正开展着的整风运动进行到底，职工的劳动热情必然会更加高涨。狠狠地整改工作，认真地总结和吸取自己的经验教训，加强对竞赛的具体组织领导，利用一切有利因素，扫除各种障碍，一个新的生产高潮必然来到。
