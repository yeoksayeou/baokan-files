Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Staff members of the Propaganda Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a series of meetings to thoroughly expose the vicious face of Chen Xiuliang, a rightist element within the Party.

Chen Xiuliang is the former Deputy Director of the Provincial Propaganda Department. According to the numerous materials that have been exposed, Chen Xiuliang, who has always called herself an "old revolutionary," was originally an extremely right-wing element within the Party, utterly poisonous, who was full of revisionist thought, covered in sores of the exploiting class, and who was anti-Party, anti-people, anti-Soviet, anti-people's democratic dictatorship, and anti-socialist.

Chen Xiuliang came from a family of landlords and merchants. Although she joined the Party during the Great Revolution, she has always maintained extremely serious bourgeois individualistic ideas and work styles because she has long neglected the transformation of her ideological stand. Therefore, she embarked on a path that ran counter to the cause of the Party and the people very early on.

People revealed: Chen Xiuliang has always held deep-seated hatred for the Party and has viciously attacked the Party whenever she had the opportunity. At the first meeting of the Second Congress of the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee held last year, she was the most ferocious "hitman" attacking the previous Provincial Committee, completely denying the achievements of the previous Provincial Committee's work, and maliciously describing the Party's internal life as a mess, even slandering the responsible comrades of the Provincial Committee as "emperors." At that time, she also went to Haining County to participate in the county's Party Congress, where she slandered and attacked the county committee and grassroots leaders, deliberately undermining the unity of the Party, and maliciously provoking the relationship between local and non-local cadres in the county. She also often slandered that there was "no right or wrong, no distinction between loyalty and treachery" within the Party. She boasted about herself, saying: "I have worked enthusiastically and loyally for the Party all my life, but two-thirds of the time in the past thirty years I have been carrying a burden." The implication was that the Party was indiscriminate and unfair. She tried her best to attack and slander the Party's policy of eliminating counter-revolutionaries, exaggerating individual shortcomings in the movement and describing it as "adopting subjective, arbitrary, and crude methods against the political lives of cadres" and "a concrete manifestation of bad work style." She also described the Party's investigation of the history of individual Party members who shared her views as "political persecution."

Chen Xiuliang also tried her best to oppose the Party's leadership over the work of the government. She repeatedly spread rumors, saying: "The biggest problem now is the lack of separation between the Party and the government" "The county is replacing the government with the Party, and the province is the same."

She also opposed the Party's policy of having secondary and primary school graduates participate in agricultural labor. She openly told many people: "My daughter will not participate in agricultural production. If she fails to get into university, I would rather hire a tutor." At the same time, she also opposed the Party committee's implementation of this policy. In the first half of this year, when the Science Division of the Provincial Propaganda Department proposed actively organizing a group of urban graduates to participate in agricultural production, she openly opposed this suggestion.

Chen Xiuliang often used her position as Deputy Director of the Provincial Propaganda Department to spread her anti-Marxist-Leninist arguments and revisionist viewpoints. She opposed counties running spare-time political schools, opposed colleges and universities running Marxist-Leninist night universities, and opposed people studying Marxist-Leninist classics. She believed that "classic works are a rope that binds people's thinking." She also opposed the establishment of a theoretical education team. In her lectures, she spread a large number of revisionist poisonous weeds: she denied the existence of classes in Chinese society; she also openly spread the fallacy that China could "peacefully grow into socialism." She said: "The argument that peacefully growing into socialism has been criticized in the Soviet Union and is not suitable for the Soviet Union, but the situation in China is different." She also described the Party as a joint political association of various classes. She often praised the reactionary views of some revisionist elements abroad.

During the great storm in May of this year, Chen Xiuliang's reactionary face was exposed even more clearly. She echoed the right-wing elements outside the Party, advocating "tearing down the wall that confuses the contradictions between the enemy and ourselves and the contradictions among the people." The meaning was that everything was a contradiction among the people, and everything could be let go. There should be no distinction between the enemy and ourselves, nor should there be any distinction between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds. If a distinction were to be made, it would be the "wall." When some students of Zhejiang Normal College opposed political and ideological education and opposed the examination of Marxist-Leninist courses and sent representatives to the Provincial Propaganda Department to petition, Chen Xiuliang not only did not criticize them, but agreed, saying: "Examining Marxism-Leninism according to the questions is dogmatism," and immediately agreed to change the political examination to "investigation." In this way, she fueled the evil trend of opposing political and ideological education in various universities in Zhejiang at that time.

After the anti-rightist struggle began, she defended many rightist elements, saying that this one was not a rightist and that one was not a rightist, trying her best to obstruct the development of the anti-rightist struggle.

After the exposure at the conference, people unanimously believed that Chen Xiuliang's anti-Party and anti-socialist ideological behavior was historical. As early as the later period of the Great Revolution, she held serious defeatist sentiments about the Chinese revolution and began to degenerate politically into a revisionist. She once wrote the materials of the Great Revolution into a novel, describing the heroic struggle of the Party as a desperate, futile, and subjectivist sacrifice, portraying the leaders of the Party as tyrannical people, portraying the workers as selfish, timid, and fearful people, and portraying the Party cadres as blind followers and wavering elements, who were all unclear about the direction and had no confidence in the revolutionary cause.

Her bourgeois decadent ideas also made her increasingly degenerate. For example, she often said: "It is better to do one less thing than to do one more thing, and it is better to have nothing to do than to do one less thing." Under the guidance of this idea, she often did not do her job, did not go to the office to work, and even refused to meet with subordinates when they came to her. When someone asked her to give a lecture, she openly said: "I will not speak without money." Every time after finishing a lecture, she asked her secretary to urge for the lecture fee. The worst thing was that Chen Xiuliang still tried her best to quibble and resist in the face of the conclusive facts that had been exposed, and refused to bow her head and confess her guilt. The Committee of the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Propaganda Department has decided to publicize all her materials to cadres as materials for negative education.

### 满脑子修正主义思想　混身是剥削阶级脓疮　陈修良五毒俱全疯狂反党

　　满脑子修正主义思想　混身是剥削阶级脓疮
　　陈修良五毒俱全疯狂反党
    新华社专稿　中共浙江省委宣传部工作人员最近连续举行大会，彻底揭露了党内右派分子陈修良的凶恶面貌。
    陈修良是前省委宣传部副部长，从揭发出来的众多的材料来看，过去一向自称为“老革命”的陈修良，原是一个满脑子修正主义思想、混身长着剥削阶级脓疮的反党、反人民、反苏、反人民民主专政、反社会主义的五毒俱全的党内极右派分子。
    陈修良出身于地主兼商人的家庭，虽在大革命时期就已入党，但因长期不注意自己的思想立场的改造，所以一直保持着极为严重的资产阶级个人主义的思想作风，很早就走上了与党和人民事业相背的道路。
    人们揭露：陈修良一贯对党抱着刻骨的仇恨，一有机会就恶毒地向党进攻。在去年举行的中共浙江省第二届代表大会第一次会议上，她是攻击前届省委最凶猛的“打手”，完全否认前届省委的工作成绩，并且恶意地把党内生活描写成一团糟，甚至污蔑省委负责同志是“皇帝”。那时她还曾到海宁县参加了县的党代表大会，对县委和基层领导进行了污蔑和攻击，有意破坏党的团结，并且恶毒地挑拨该县本地干部和外地干部之间的关系。她还经常污蔑党内“没有是非、忠奸不分”。她吹嘘自己说：“一生热情忠诚为党工作，但是三十年中有三分之二时间背着包袱。”意思就是说党是是非不分的和不公平的。她竭力攻击和污蔑党的肃反政策，夸大肃反运动中的个别缺点，把它说成是：“对干部的政治生命采取主观武断、粗暴手段”，是“恶劣作风的具体表现”。她还把党审查个别和她气味相投的党员的历史说成是“政治陷害”。
    陈修良还竭力反对党对政府工作的领导，她不止一次地造谣说：“现在最大的问题是党政不分”“县里是以党代政，省里也是这样。”
    她还反对党所提出的中小学毕业生参加农业劳动的政策，她公开地对好多人讲：“我的女儿不参加农业生产，考不上大学宁可请家庭教师。”同时，她还反对党委执行这一个政策。今年上半年，省委宣传部科学处提出积极组织一批城市毕业生去参加农业生产时，她公开反对这个意见。
    陈修良经常利用省委宣传部副部长的职位，散布她的反马克思列宁主义的论调和修正主义的观点。她反对各县举办业余政治学校，反对大专学校开办马克思列宁主义夜大学，反对人们学习马列主义经典著作。她认为“经典著作是一条绳子，束缚人的思想。”她也反对建立理论教育队伍。她在讲课中散布了大量修正主义的毒草：她否定中国社会有阶级的存在；还公开散布中国可以“和平长入社会主义”的谬论。她说：“和平长入社会主义这个论点在苏联是受到批判的，不适宜苏联，但中国情况就不一样。”她又把党说成像一个各阶级的联合政治协会。她对国外的一些修正主义分子的反动论点也常常加以赞扬。
    在今年5月的大风浪时期，陈修良的反动面目暴露得更加明显了。她和党外的右派分子互相呼应，主张“要拆敌我矛盾与人民内部矛盾混淆不清的墙。”意思是说一切都是人民内部矛盾，不管什么都可以放，不应分敌我也不要分什么香花和毒草，如果要加以区别的话那就是“墙”。当浙江师范学院部分学生反对政治思想教育、反对马克思列宁主义课程考试而派代表到省委宣传部请愿时，陈修良不仅未加批驳，反而同意说：“按题考试马列主义是教条主义，”因而立即答应把政治考试改为“考查”。这样，就助长了当时浙江各高等学校中反对政治思想教育的歪风。
    当反右斗争展开以后，她又为不少右派分子辩护，说这个不是右派，那个也不是右派，竭力阻挠反右斗争的开展。
    经过大会的揭发，人们一致认为陈修良的反党反社会主义的思想行为是有历史性的。早在大革命后期，她就对中国革命抱着严重的失败主义的情绪，在政治上开始堕落为修正主义分子。她曾把大革命时期的材料写成小说，把党的英勇斗争描写成绝望的、无谓的、主观主义的牺牲，把党的领导者写成是蛮横无理的人，把工人描写成为自私自利、胆小怕事的人，把党的干部描写成为盲从分子、动摇分子，他们对于革命事业都是不明方向和毫无信心的。
    她的资产阶级的腐朽思想也使她日益堕落。如她常说：“工作多一事不如少一事，少一事不如没有事。”在这种思想指导下，她经常不做工作，不到办公室办公，甚至下级找到她时也拒不接见。当有人请她讲课时，她公开说：“没有钱我是不讲的”。每次讲完课，就叫秘书替她催要讲课费。最恶劣的是，陈修良在被揭露的确凿的事实面前还百般狡赖顽抗，不肯低头服罪。中共浙江省委宣传部机关委员会已决定把她的全部材料向干部公布，作为反面教育的材料。
