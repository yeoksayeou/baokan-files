Changchun Blizzard Disrupts Traffic
    City Leaders Take the Lead in Clearing Snow
    (Our report) Changchun — From the evening of the 16th to the 18th, Changchun experienced a heavy snowfall, rare in recent years. Coupled with gale-force winds of level eight or nine, snowdrifts in some areas of the streets reached two meters in thickness, severely impacting the city's traffic. The trolleybus line to the Changchun First Automobile Works was blocked by snow, and service was suspended on the morning of the 18th, preventing nearly ten thousand workers residing in the city from arriving at work on time.

    The Changchun Municipal People's Committee issued an emergency notice, calling on all municipal organs, factories, military units, schools, and residents to clear the snow. Song Jiehan, First Secretary of the Changchun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, along with more than six hundred cadres from the Municipal Committee, the Municipal People's Committee, and other units, braved the blizzard to clear snow along a six-kilometer route. After five or six hours of struggle, the trolleybus finally resumed service at around 3:00 PM.

    长春暴风雪交通受阻
    市负责干部带头清扫积雪
    本报讯  16日晚至18日，长春市降落了一场几年来少有的大雪，加上八、九级的大风，街道上有些地方积雪厚达两公尺，严重地影响了市内交通的运行。通往长春第一汽车制造厂的电车，因积雪阻路，18日晨停止了通行，致使近万名居住在市内的职工不能按时上班。
    长春市人民委员会发出紧急通知，号召全市机关、工厂、部队、学校和居民清扫积雪。中共长春市委第一书记宋洁涵和市委、市人民委员会等单位的六百多名干部，冒着暴风雪，在六公里长的路线上清扫积雪。经过五六小时的搏斗，电车终于在下午三时许开始通行。
