    A "Bus" That Doesn't Sell Tickets
    One Saturday evening, I was waiting for a bus at the Baishiqiao station in the western suburbs to go home. Passengers formed a long queue, and one bus after another drove straight past because they were full, without even stopping. Some stopped, but only a few people squeezed on.

    Suddenly, a small jeep with a trailer stopped in front of us, and the driver shouted:
    "Anyone going to Xiyuan can get in!"

    Then, people jumped into the car one by one.

    The car stopped at each bus stop, and people got off one after another. They didn't give the driver "fare," but they all expressed their heartfelt gratitude: "Thank you!" "Thank you very much!"

    The driver didn't answer, just nodded with a smile, as if returning the greeting, and as if he didn't think there was anything special about his actions!

    If this matter is said to be ordinary, it really "isn't anything," he just did a good deed that he could do. But I think he did a good deed that he could do, but that many people haven't done.

    不卖票的“公共汽车”
    一个星期六的傍晚，我在西郊白石桥车站候车回家，乘客排成了一列长队，一辆辆的公共汽车因客满而匆匆地直驶过去，连停也不停；有的虽停，也只挤上了几个人。
    突然，一辆带着挂斗的小吉普在我们面前停住了，司机同志喊着：
    “谁到西苑，可以上车！”
    接着，人们就一个个地跳上了汽车。
    汽车按着公共汽车站一站一停，人们先后都下车了，他们没有给司机同志“车钱”，但都说出了衷心感激的话：“谢谢您！”“那就谢谢您了！”
    司机同志没有答话，只是微笑的点点头，表示答礼，又好像认为他的行为没有什么！
    这件事要说是平常，的确也“没有什么”，他只是做了他所能做的一件好事。但我认为，他做了他可以做、而好多人还没有做的一件好事。
                （北京紫竹院冯家玲）
