　　Measures Beneficial to Construction
　　I believe that the Draft Interim Regulations on Apprenticeship Terms and Living Allowances are measures beneficial to China's construction endeavors.
　　Our factory recruited about two thousand new workers in 1956, most of whom came from rural areas. After starting work, their lifestyles completely changed within a year due to their relatively high wages. Because the technical requirements for them were low and they were promoted too quickly, many looked down on the veteran workers. In the ×× unit of our factory, a young man was promoted to a third-grade apprentice less than three months after joining the factory. He immediately changed into khaki clothes and refused to wear his cotton shoes and clothes anymore. After being promoted to a second-grade worker in six months, he wore leather shoes, and in less than a year, he was wearing wool serge, and occasionally had a feast in the snack bar. When his family wrote to him asking for money, he wrote back saying, "I haven't been working for long, and my salary is not high, and I still owe people money... I hope you can help me..." Who would have thought that excessive wages harmed him.
　　From a technical point of view, a young man in our factory (who joined in 1956) was assigned to a relatively simple process to learn. Because the work was simple, he could basically operate independently in less than three months. Once, when the master asked him to wipe the machine tool, he said, "I came here to learn technology, who will wipe the bed for you?" He openly left. Five months later, he completed his apprenticeship. At this time, he said to the master, "What's so great about you? You've been working for years and you're only at the fourth grade!" This example proves that shortening the apprenticeship period and providing high living allowances are not beneficial to the workers or the country. Therefore, the State Council's regulations on extending the apprenticeship period and providing appropriate living allowances during the learning period are reasonable.

　　The Problem is Solved
　　The Draft Interim Regulations on Vacation and Wage Treatment for Workers and Staff Returning Home to Visit Relatives once again embody the superiority of the socialist system.
　　The workers of our Harbin Turbine Factory are all excitedly discussing it. Many comrades in our factory come from all over the country, far away from their hometowns, away from their parents, wives, and children, working for the socialist construction cause. Because they live far away from home, it is difficult for them to go home to visit relatives. Therefore, many comrades apply to the factory for dormitories in order to bring their families over. This will increase the urban population, tighten the supply of materials, and reduce agricultural production forces. In the future, the implementation of the home visit system will solve this problem.

　　The Family Life of Apprentices Must Be Considered
　　The Draft Interim Regulations on Apprenticeship Terms and Living Allowances is good because it pays attention to improving the quality of new workers. But I think we should also fully consider the family life of the apprentices. Among the apprentices who joined the factory in 1956, some do have family burdens, and if the new regulations are implemented, their family life will become difficult. Therefore, I suggest that the apprentices recruited in 1956 be given promotion exams according to the original regulations, or that those who are really in financial difficulty be given appropriate subsidies to stabilize their learning mood.

　　大家来讨论国务院公布的四项规定草案
　  有利于建设事业的措施
    关于学徒学习期限和生活补贴暂行规定草案，我认为是有利于我国建设事业的措施。
    我们厂1956年招收了约二千新工人，其中大部分是从农村出来的。参加工作后，由于他们的工资偏高，不到一年时间，有些人就完全改变了生活方式。由于对他们的技术要求低，提升太快，不少人看不起老工人。我厂××单位，有个青年是来厂不到三个月升为三级学徒后，他就全换上卡叽衣服，再也不想穿那双棉布鞋和衣服了；六个月升为二级工以后，他穿上了皮鞋，不到一年的时间他穿起毛哔叽来了，不时还在小吃部大吃一顿。他家里来信要他寄点钱回去，他却给家里写信说“我工作不久，工资不多，还欠上了别人的账，……希能帮我解决……”。谁想到这是过多的工资害了他。
    从技术上看，我厂有个青年（1956年进厂的），来厂后分配在一道较简单的工序上学习，由于工作简单，不到三个月他基本上可以单独操作了。有一次师傅要他擦机床，他说：“我是来学技术的，谁给你擦床子呀？”他公然走了。五个月后，他出了师，这时，他对师傅说：“你有什么了不起呀？搞几年才四级！”从这个例子看，可以证明学徒学习期限短，生活补贴高了，对工人、对国家都没有好处。所以国务院规定的学徒延长学习时间和在学习期间适当的给于生活补贴是合理的。

    难题解决了
    关于工人、职员回家探亲的假期和工资待遇暂行规定草案，又一次地体现了社会主义制度的优越性。
    我们哈尔滨汽轮机厂的职工都在兴奋地议论着。我们厂中很多同志来自祖国四面八方，远离家乡，远离自己的父母妻儿，为社会主义的建设事业工作着。由于离家较远，很难回家探亲。因此，有许多同志向工厂申请宿舍，以便把家属接来。这样，就会使城市人口增加，物资供应紧张，又削减了农业生产力量。将来实行回家探亲制度以后，就可以解决这个难题了。

    要考虑徒工的家庭生活
    徒工学习期限和生活补贴的暂行规定草案，注意到提高新工人的质量，是好的。但我认为也应当充分考虑徒工的家庭生活情况。1956年进厂的徒工中，有的人确实有家庭负担的，按照新规定执行，家庭生活就发生困难。所以我建议在1956年招收的徒工，按原规定晋级考试，或者适当的给家庭实在困难的人以补助，以安定他们的学习情绪。
