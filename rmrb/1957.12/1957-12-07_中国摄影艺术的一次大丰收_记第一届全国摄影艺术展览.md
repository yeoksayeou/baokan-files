　　A Great Harvest of Chinese Photographic Art
　　——On the First National Photographic Art Exhibition

    The First National Photographic Art Exhibition, sponsored by the Chinese Photographic Society, with the enthusiastic participation of over eight hundred photographers and photography workers, and with the strong support of all parties, has recently met with the public after serious and conscientious evaluation. The three hundred and twenty-one works exhibited here are some of the most carefully crafted masterpieces of our country's photographers in recent years, and also an unprecedented great harvest in the Chinese photographic art world.

    The First National Photographic Art Exhibition is a flower blooming amidst the "Hundred Flowers Blooming," and also a fruit of the "Hundred Flowers Blooming." The Party's literary and artistic policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" has played a decisive role in the prosperity of our country's photographic art creation, encouraging the creative enthusiasm of photographers, pointing out the path of art serving socialism, and leading our country's photographic art cause to a new historical stage, making photographic art a flower of socialism.

    The First National Photographic Art Exhibition is rich and colorful. The works here, like poems, tell people that our country is a great country, with beautiful rivers and mountains, abundant resources, and that our people love labor, love peace, and the country's construction is advancing rapidly and thriving. Many works profoundly reflect our great motherland's socialist construction and socialist transformation movement, reflecting people's happy lives. Shi Shaohua's "Steel Ingot," Yuan Ling's "Ten Thousand People Rejoicing," Wang Wenxi's "Harvest," and Wang Zhiyuan's "Ancient Tree Saplings" are all excellent works. The author of "Steel Ingot" used photographic perspective to create a strong contrast between the huge steel ingot and people, with several oblique rays of light showing the magnificent atmosphere of the factory building, and the entire picture shows the steel ingot production even more magnificent, making people feel that building socialism must rely on heavy industry as its foundation. "Ten Thousand People Rejoicing" shows millions of people celebrating the great victory of our country's socialist transformation. "Ancient Tree Saplings," through a group of innocent and lively children jumping and playing under ancient cypress trees, symbolizes the new life of our era.

    Many works here profoundly and delicately express people's inner world, express the character of the new era and the new relationship between people. Li Zhongkui's "At the Marriage Registration Office," Cai Shangxiong's "Excellent Breeder Peng Guiying," Li Yifang's "Let Me Try Too," etc., are also several good works. The authors of these works used close-up techniques to portray the simple images and characters of the protagonists. "At the Marriage Registration Office" captures the moment when an ethnic minority girl is registering for marriage, expressing all her emotional changes at that time. She is shy, tightly biting her silk scarf, and her eyes reveal joy, purity, and happiness. This kind of emotional expression is only possible after the elimination of national oppression and the true liberation of women.

    In addition, Wang Yibo and Ke Fu's "Crossing the Road," Lü Houmin's "Chairman Mao in the Factory," Zhou Xiao and Gao Changfu's "Delivering Water," Cao Guijiang and Lü Xiangyou's "Helping Villagers Collect Nets," and Tie Mao's "Great Friendship" and other works vividly reflect the new relationship between people in the new society. From these new relationships, it can be seen that in our country, people are establishing a new moral atmosphere, and unity, friendship, mutual assistance, love for the country, and love for the people have become the virtues of our people.

    There are also works by Hong Kong photographers. Zhang Guangliang's "Forced Demolition" strongly reflects that the working people of Hong Kong are working under the drive of clubs, forced to tear down their own homes with their own hands. After seeing these works, people will feel happy and proud to live in a new China.

    The works in the First Photographic Exhibition are very broad in subject matter and diverse in style. In addition to works reflecting the real lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, there are also a considerable number of portraits, still lifes, landscapes, flowers, and works featuring birds, beasts, fish, and insects. Cai Junsan's "Sweetness," Xue Zijiang's "Lively Guanxian," Huang Xiang's "After the Rain in Huangshan," etc., are excellent works of this kind. The old photographer Cai Junsan's "Sweetness" is a good work. He used skillful photography techniques and a unique style to express the rich southern specialty of our country - tangerines. "After the Rain in Huangshan" is a very good landscape photograph. The author used the lingering mist after the rain to show the front and back layers of the scenery, depicting our country's beautiful rivers and mountains even more magnificent and colorful.

    The works in this photographic exhibition have a high level in terms of photographic techniques, such as the use of light, the control of color tones, darkroom production, and composition. In particular, the works of some old photographers have their own unique features in expressing the texture of objects or rich layers, which are very worthy of young photographers to learn from. In particular, the works of photographers from Hong Kong and Macao and overseas Chinese photographers make the subject matter and form of this exhibition more rich and diverse.

    The First National Photographic Art Exhibition is a great review of our country's outstanding photographic works and a beginning for further prosperity of photographic art creation. Through the exhibition of these works and the exchange of creative experiences, this new art flower will grow more vigorously and bloom more beautifully in our socialist garden!

　　中国摄影艺术的一次大丰收
　　——记第一届全国摄影艺术展览
　　陈勃
    中国摄影学会主办的第一届全国摄影艺术展览，在八百多位摄影家、摄影工作者的踊跃参加下，在各方面的大力支持下，经过严肃认真的评选之后，最近和大家见面了。这里展出的三百二十一幅作品，是我国摄影家们近年来的一部分精心杰作，也是中国摄影艺术界一次空前未有的大丰收。
    第一届全国摄影艺术展览，是“百花齐放”中开放的一朵花，也是“百花齐放”的一个果。党的“百花齐放”的文艺方针，对我国摄影艺术创作的繁荣起了决定性的作用，它鼓舞了摄影家们的创作积极性，指出了艺术为社会主义服务的道路，它把我国的摄影艺术事业引向一个新的历史阶段，使摄影艺术成为社会主义的花朵。
    第一届全国摄影艺术展览，是丰富多采的。这里的像诗篇一般的作品告诉人们：我国是一个伟大的国家，江山秀丽，物资丰富，我国的人民热爱劳动，热爱和平，国家的建设一日千里，欣欣向荣。这里有许多作品深刻地反映了我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造运动，反映了人们的幸福生活。石少华的“钢锭”、袁苓的“万民欢腾”、王文西的“丰收”和王志渊的“古树幼苗”等，都是一些很好的作品。“钢锭”的作者利用了摄影的透视，把巨大的钢锭和人作了强烈的对比，远远几条斜射的光线，表现了厂房的宏伟气魄，整个画面把钢锭生产显示得更加伟大壮观，使人觉得，建设社会主义必须依靠重工业做基础。“万民欢腾”表现了千百万群众正在为我国社会主义改造的伟大胜利而欢庆。“古树幼苗”，通过一群天真活泼的儿童在古柏树下的欢跳，象征我们时代的新生。
    这里有许多作品深刻而细腻地表现了人们的内心世界，表现了新时代的人物性格和人与人之间的新的关系。李仲魁的“在结婚登记处”、蔡尚雄的“优秀饲养员彭桂英”、李义芳的“我也来试试”等，也是几幅很好的作品。这些作品的作者以特写的手法，刻画了各个主人公的纯朴的形象和性格。“在结婚登记处”，抓取了一位民族姑娘在结婚登记时的一瞬间，表现了她当时的全部情感的变化，她羞答答，嘴唇紧紧地咬住自己的绢巾，在她的眼睛里流露出愉快、纯洁和幸福。这种感情的流露，只有在解除了民族压迫，在妇女真正得到解放以后才有可能。
    另外，王一波、柯复的“过马路”、吕厚民的“毛主席在工厂里”、周虓、高常福的“送水”、曹桂江、吕相友的“助民收网”和铁矛的“伟大的友谊”等作品，生动地反映了新社会人和人之间的新的关系。从这些新的关系里可以看出，在我们的国家里，人们正在树立一种新的道德风气，团结、友爱、互助、爱国家、爱人民，已经成为我国人民的美德。
    这里还有香港摄影家们的作品。张光亮的“强拆”，强烈地反映出，香港的劳动人民在棍棒的驱使下进行着工作，他们被迫用自己的双手拆毁自己的家室。看了这些作品，人们都会为自己生活在新中国而感到幸福和自豪。
    第一届摄影展览的作品，题材十分广泛，风格也是多样的。除了反映工农兵现实生活题材的作品以外，也有相当数量的人像、静物、风光、花卉，以及鸟兽鱼虫等作品。蔡俊三的“甜蜜”、薛子江的“热闹的灌县”、黄翔的“黄山雨后”等就是这类作品中的佳作。老摄影家蔡俊三的“甜蜜”是一幅好作品，他以纯熟的摄影技巧，独特的风格，表现了我国丰富的南方特产——蜜柑。“黄山雨后”是一幅很好的风景照片，作者利用雨后尚存的薄雾，表现了景物的前后层次，把我国的锦绣河山描绘得更加瑰丽多姿。
    这一届摄影展览的作品，在摄影技巧上，如光线的运用，色调的控制，暗房制作，构图等各方面，都有着较高的水平。特别是一些老摄影家的作品，他们在表现实物的质感或丰富的层次上，都各有独到之处，很值得年轻的摄影工作者学习。特别是港澳摄影家和海外侨胞摄影家的作品，使这次展览的题材和形式更加丰富多样。
    第一届全国摄影艺术展览，是我国优秀摄影作品的一次大检阅，也是进一步繁荣摄影艺术创作的一个开端。通过这次作品的展出和创作经验的交流，这支新的艺术花朵，在我们社会主义的大花园里，还将长得更旺盛，开得更鲜艳！
