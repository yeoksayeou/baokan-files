　　Over a Thousand Coal Gas Engines Shipped to Henan
　  Tianjin Tractor Plant Handles Both Manufacturing and Repair
    (Our dispatch) To support farmland water conservancy construction, the state-owned Tianjin Tractor Factory has already produced more than 1,400 coal gas engines for Henan this year. Recently, it signed a contract with the agricultural department of Henan Province to produce another 8,000 four-horsepower coal gas engines for the province next year.
    The Tianjin Tractor Factory produces two types of coal gas engines, the 24A model and the 410M model, which were successfully trial-produced in July by modifying gasoline engines. The 24A coal gas engine has been in mass production since August, with a planned production of 1,600 units this year. Before trial-producing the coal gas engine, the factory sent people to the countryside to conduct research and investigation, and the produced coal gas engines can generally meet the current needs of the countryside. The characteristics are light weight, easy to move; abundant fuel sources, burning coal and charcoal are both possible; and low price, with each three-and-a-half horsepower coal gas engine selling for only a little over 1,100 yuan. This type of coal gas engine can be used by rural areas to drive waterwheels and water pumps, as well as to engage in agricultural and sideline product processing such as cotton ginning and flood drainage. After the machines were shipped to the countryside, the factory, in the spirit of being responsible to the end, sent technicians and veteran workers to the sales locations in Henan several times to help the local agricultural departments train personnel in the use of coal gas engines. To solve the problem of repairing coal gas engines after they are damaged and replacing parts, the factory also set up temporary service stations in Zhengzhou and other places to help farmers gradually master and repair the machines.
    More than 1,000 coal gas engines that the factory has already shipped to rural Henan are generally in good working order. A three-and-a-half horsepower coal gas engine can irrigate an average of 35 mu of farmland per day, basically achieving full design efficiency.

　　千余台煤气机运到河南
　  天津拖拉机厂既管制造又管修理
    本报讯　为了支援农田水利建设，国营天津拖拉机制造厂今年已经为河南生产了一千四百多台煤气机，最近又同河南农业部门签订合同，要在明年再为这个省生产八千台四马力的煤气机。
    天津拖拉机制造厂生产的煤气机有24A型和410M型两种，是今年7月份用汽油机改装试制成功的。24A型煤气机从8月份起就开始大批生产，今年计划生产一千六百台。这个厂在试制煤气机之前，就曾派人到农村进行了调查研究，生产出的煤气机一般能适应目前农村的需要。特点是重量轻，可以随便移动；燃料来源充足，烧煤、烧木炭都可以；价钱便宜，三个半马力的煤气机每台只售一千一百多元。这种煤气机可供农村用来带动水车、水泵，并可以用来从事轧花等农副产品加工和排涝工作。这个厂在机器运往农村以后，还本着负责到底的精神，曾先后几次派技术人员和老工人到河南销售地点帮助当地农业部门训练使用煤气机的人材；为了解决煤气机损坏以后的修理问题和零件的替换，这个厂还在郑州等地设立了临时服务站，以便帮助农民逐渐掌握和修理机器。
    这个厂已经运到河南农村的一千多台煤气机，使用情况基本良好。三个半马力的煤气机每天平均可以灌溉农田三十五亩，基本上达到全部设计效率。
