    An Easy-to-Understand Science Article
    I read the article "Artificial Satellites and Radio Electronics" on page seven of your newspaper on November 24th, which greatly increased my knowledge. First of all, I want to thank the author, Comrade Chen Fangyun, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Institute of Electronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He not only introduced the significant importance of the Soviet Union's launch of artificial Earth satellites, but also explained the relationship between artificial satellites and radio electronics in an easy-to-understand way. This is one of the best articles I have recently seen in the newspapers introducing Soviet artificial satellites. Moreover, at the end of the article, he gave easy-to-understand explanations of specialized terms such as "frequency," "Doppler effect," "radar," "ionosphere," "shortwave," and "ultra-shortwave," which helps in understanding the entire article.
    I suggest that our experts and professors should preferably attach annotations when writing scientific articles to facilitate learning for general readers.　Hebei Jingxing　Zhang Huai

    Welcome the Revised Supplement
    After seeing the news of the revision of the supplement, some people here felt disappointed, saying that the revised supplement would publish fewer literary works. I also love reading the literary works in the supplement, but I didn't feel that way after reading it. Because its content is more extensive, it will surely gain more readers and become a close friend to more people. These past few issues of the supplement have proven to us that it conveys voices from all aspects of society, helping us hear the footsteps of the motherland's progress from one side. It also helps us gain some scientific and health knowledge and common sense about family education in our daily lives. Therefore, I warmly welcome the revised supplement.

    After the revision of your newspaper's supplement, the content is richer than before, and it feels particularly warm and intimate to read. In particular, the short article "How Do Children's Mistakes Arise?" is even more approachable, and ordinary housewives can understand it. Such meaningful articles can guide people's daily lives.

    Hope Newspaper and Periodical Article Abstracts Can Be More Timely
    Your newspaper often publishes abstracts of articles from national newspapers and periodicals, which is very beneficial to readers. However, I believe that the abstracts should be compiled and published as timely as possible.
    Looking through the "Newspaper and Periodical Article Abstracts" column in your newspaper in November, most of them were published late. For example, "The Philosophical Significance of the Launch of Artificial Earth Satellites" and "The Achievements of Soviet Science are the Achievements of the Party's Leadership and the Socialist System" published on November 24th were selected from the "New Construction" magazine published on November 3rd and the "Liberation Daily" of November 6th; "The Party Can Lead Everything" published on November 23rd was selected from the "Hubei Daily" of November 2nd; "Intellectuals Can Only Be Transformed Through Labor Training" on November 19th was selected from the "Liberation Daily" of November 1st. These are all quite far from the original publication time.

    Report on the Activities of People from All Walks of Life Supporting Agriculture
    Recently, after your newspaper continuously published the two editorials "Mobilize the Whole People, Discuss the Outline for Agricultural Development, and Launch a New Upsurge in Agricultural Production" and "Everyone Comes to Support Agriculture," the broad masses of people have become more concerned about and attached more importance to agriculture. However, the newspaper's coverage of the activities of people from all walks of life enthusiastically supporting the development of agriculture is insufficient. Besides reporting on some cadres going to the countryside for production, there is very little else. We hope that the newspaper will report more on the following situations: How do the masses who are not engaged in agricultural production and rural work understand the relationship between the development of agriculture and themselves? What have they said they will do for the development of agriculture? Have they already started doing it? What ideological gains have they made in the great discussion of agricultural development? In short, it is necessary to expand the scope of reporting on agricultural issues, and not be limited to "formulating plans" and "achieving indicators."

　　读者、作者、编者
    一篇通俗易懂的科学文章
    我看到你报11月24日七版：“人造卫星和无线电电子学”一文，使我增加了许多知识。首先要感谢作者——中国科学院电子学研究所筹委会副主任陈芳允同志，他不仅介绍了苏联发射人造地球卫星的重大意义，而且还通俗地说明了人造卫星和无线电电子学的关系，这是我最近看到报纸上介绍苏联人造卫星的一篇好文章，而且文末还对“频率”、“都卜勒效应”、“雷达”、“电离层”、“短波”、“超短波”、等专门名词，作了通俗的解释，有助于学习全篇文章。
    我建议，我们的专家和教授在写科学文章时，最好附上注解，以便一般读者学习。　河北井陉　张怀
    欢迎改版后的副刊
    看到副刊改版的消息后，我们这里曾有人感到失望，据说是因为改版后的副刊，文艺作品就会登得少了。我也是很爱看副刊上的文艺作品的，但我看了以后并没有这种感觉。因为它的内容更广泛了，一定能获得更多的读者，成为更多的人们的知心好友。这几期副刊已经向我们证明，它传达了来自社会各方面的声音，帮助我们从一个侧面听到了祖国前进的脚步。它也帮助我们获得了一些日常生活中的科学卫生知识和家庭教育方面的常识等等。所以，我热烈地欢迎改版后的副刊。

    你报的副刊改版以后，内容比以前丰富了，而且读起来使人感到分外亲切。特别是“孩子的错误是怎样产生的？”那篇短文，更是平易近人，一般家庭妇女都能看懂，像这样有意义的文章，能够指导人民日常的生活。

    报刊论文摘要希望更及时些
    你报经常刊登全国各报刊的论文摘要，对于读者是很有好处的。但我认为摘编应当尽可能及时些。
    翻看一下11月份的你报“报刊论文摘要”一栏，其中大部分都登晚了一些，如11月24日刊出的“人造地球卫星发射的哲学意义”和“苏联科学成果是党的领导和社会主义制度的成就”是选自11月3日出版的“新建设”杂志和11月6日的解放日报；11月23日刊出的“党能够领导一切”是选自11月2日的湖北日报；11月19日“知识分子只有通过劳动锻炼，才能得到改造”是选自11月1日的解放日报。这些都与原文的发表时间相距较远。

    要报道各阶层人民支援农业的活动
    最近你报连续发表了“发动全民，讨论农业发展纲要，掀起农业生产的新高潮”和“大家都来支援农业”两篇社论以后，广大群众对农业更加关心，更加重视了。但是，报纸对于各阶层人民热烈支持发展农业的活动报道不够。除了报道一些机关干部下乡生产以外，其他就很少了。我们希望报纸多多报道这样的情况：没有从事农业生产和农村工作的群众怎样认识发展农业和自己的关系？他们表示要为发展农业做些什么？是不是已经开始做了？他们在发展农业的大讨论当中有什么思想收获？总之，要扩大农业问题的报道范围，不要局限于“制定规划”，“达到指标”上面。
