    Producing Whatever Agriculture Needs as Much as Possible
    Yuxi Prefecture Actively and Frugally Develops Industry

    (Our newspaper's reporter Chen Yongjin reports) Before 1952, the twelve counties of Yunnan's Yuxi Prefecture only had two small generators with a generating capacity of 20 kilowatts, and a total of ten workers. Even horseshoes had to be transported from other places. Although there were rich coal mines here, tobacco was cured using charcoal. Before liberation, there was a gun-making furnace here, because there were many bandits. Now, Yuxi Prefecture has initially formed a small industrial network, and the coal and iron produced, in addition to meeting local needs, can also be transferred to other places.

    In the past two or three years, Yuxi Prefecture has established more than seventy local factories and mines, plus grain processing plants, numbering no less than a hundred. Among them are iron smelters, coal mines, automobile and horse-drawn carriage repair shops, small hardware manufacturing plants, coking plants, asbestos plants, logging plants, wineries, sugar mills, printing plants, brick and tile factories, and so on, covering twenty-seven industries, with more than seven thousand industrial workers. In order to develop local industry, they also paid special attention to the development of the machine industry. Now the entire prefecture has forty machine tools. (During Long Yun's rule, the Kunming Machine Tool Factory only had eighteen machine tools, two fewer than the current Yuxi Iron Factory.) Now the prefecture's machine industry can manufacture sugar cane juicers, threshers, water pumps, water gates, mountain plows, and other agricultural implements. In a word: they manufacture whatever agriculture needs as much as possible themselves. In order to meet the needs of farmers' lives, Yuxi Prefecture has also established some consumer goods factories, such as candy factories, salted fish processing plants, and pickled vegetable factories.

    Yuxi Prefecture's local factories are established according to the resource conditions of each county. For example, Jiangchuan is a rapeseed producing area, so an oil pressing plant was established in Jiangchuan. For example, Xinping County, located in deep mountain valleys, has forests, iron ore, and camphor, so a logging plant, a small iron smelter, and a camphor manufacturing plant were established there. Sugar mills have been established in places that produce sugarcane. Now the power generation capacity of the Yuxi area is 900 kilowatts. A small industrial network has been initially formed in Yuxi Prefecture.

    The development of local industry in the Yuxi area has been led by the Yuxi Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China. In the development of agricultural cooperation, the Yuxi Prefectural Committee deeply felt that without a corresponding local industry, agricultural development would be affected. For example, in the planting of sugarcane, in the past two or three years, the area of sugarcane in the entire region has developed to more than 40,000 mu. If the traditional method of sugar extraction is used, it would take a year to extract all the sugarcane produced in one year, which would reduce the sugar content of the sugarcane. To solve this problem, sugar cane juicers are needed. Where do sugar cane juicers come from? Buying them from other places is too expensive because of the long distance, and farmers cannot afford them. At the same time, it is difficult to buy so many sugar cane juicers from other places. The only way is to manufacture them ourselves. Manufacturing machines requires iron. How to solve the iron problem? Transporting it from outside is too expensive and also very difficult. Thus, it is necessary to mine ore from the mountains ourselves and use indigenous methods to smelt iron. Some counties in the Yuxi area are mostly economic crop areas that grow flue-cured tobacco. In the past, less flue-cured tobacco was planted, and charcoal was mostly used for curing tobacco. Now the planting area of flue-cured tobacco has developed to 300,000 mu. If charcoal is still used for curing, the trees on the mountains will be cut down in one or two years. Therefore, they actively opened four coal mines. I asked the responsible comrades here how much money was spent on opening these four coal mines? They said that it was mainly cadres taking the lead, building a few shacks and starting to work, with limited money spent. After the coal was mined, there were no roads, so they mobilized the masses to build roads themselves. The salted fish factory in Jiangchuan was established without any money from the state.

    When building factory buildings, they made do with whatever was available; when purchasing machines, they mostly purchased old machines. In order to purchase old machines and broken machines, they sent people to some old factories in Shanghai to investigate. Some old factories used old machine tools as clothes drying racks, and some factories piled old machine tools in warehouses for several years with no one taking care of them. Comrades in some factories sold broken machines to them as scrap iron. These old machine tools and scrap iron, when they got them, were repaired and became good again.

    The Yuxi Iron Factory is a typical factory established in accordance with the principle of running enterprises diligently and frugally. This factory was only established last year, but it has already manufactured enough sugar cane juicers for the entire region. If this kind of sugar cane juicer was transported from other places, it would cost more than 9,000 yuan per unit, but they manufactured it for only more than 3,000 yuan per unit. In the past, the farmers here used oxen to pull the mill to extract sugar, and the sugar extracted was called "cow dung sugar," which was cheap, but could not be sold. Since it was changed to machine extraction, the sugar has become very good yellow sand sugar, and each hundred jin of sugarcane yields 20% more sugar. The masses reflected: as long as we have sugar cane juicers, we are willing to plant sugarcane. Yuanjiang, which is rich in sugarcane, installed three sugar cane juicers last year, and plans to install thirteen more this year. The power equipment for the sugar cane juicers are all modified from broken automobile engines, and can also be used for rolling cotton, milling rice, and pumping water. The engine of a sugar cane juicer in Yuanjiang only rested for three days in half a year. This iron factory manufactured a large number of threshers, rice milling machines, and peanut shelling machines. The rice milling machine can mill more than 30,000 jin of rice per day, which is more than 20,000 jin more than those bought from other places. Now, this factory is trying to manufacture water turbines and sluice gates to meet the needs of rural water conservancy development. The water turbines they are trying to manufacture can generate electricity as long as there is a drop of two meters of water. This type of water turbine generator can be widely used in Yuxi and other places in Yunnan.

    The most prominent problem that Yuxi Prefecture feels in the development of local industry is the lack of senior technical personnel. When more complex machines break down, they have to be transported to Kunming for repair, and some machines take a long time to repair. Now, after connecting with each other, they have found old workers scattered in the countryside and technicians in industrial schools.

    The second problem is the lack of transportation capacity, which cannot transport pig iron, coal, flue-cured tobacco, and sugar out in time. In order to remedy the lack of transportation capacity, they have developed two thousand horse-drawn carriages. However, because the road is long, the cost is still very high. They also need a certain number of automobiles.

    Third, these local industries are all relatively small in scale. They are very busy during the busy farming season, and some factories have no work to do during the slack farming season. For example, the Huani sugar factory, although it can obtain a profit of more than 100,000 yuan a year, only operates for three months a year. They plan to take two measures to solve this problem: 1. Enable these workers to master multiple technologies and produce multiple products; 2. Concentrate workers during production, and disperse workers to agricultural cooperatives to do farm work when not producing.

    农业需要什么就尽可能地生产什么
    玉溪专区积极勤俭地发展工业
    本报讯  记者陈勇进报道：1952年以前，云南玉溪专区十二个县才有两个发电能力二十瓩的小发电机，共有十个工人。马掌钉也要从外地运来。这里虽然有丰富的煤矿，可是烤烟却烧木炭。解放前，这里有个造枪炉，那是因为这里的土匪多。现在，玉溪专区已初步形成了一个小型的工业网，生产的煤和铁，除了满足本地需要外，还可以外调。
    在最近两三年里，玉溪专区建立了七十多个地方工厂和矿山，加上粮食加工厂，不下百个。其中有炼铁厂、煤矿、汽车马车修配厂、小五金制造厂、炼焦厂、石棉厂、伐木厂、酿酒厂、榨糖厂、印刷厂、砖瓦厂等等二十七个行业，共有七千多产业工人。他们为了发展地方工业，还特别注意发展机械工业。现在全专区有四十部机床。（龙云统治时期的昆明机床厂才有十八部机床，比现在玉溪铁工厂还少两部。）现在专区的机械工业能制造榨糖机、打谷机、抽水机、水闸、山地步犁等农具。一句话：农业需要什么，他们就尽可能地自己制造什么。为了满足农民生活的需要，玉溪专区也建立了一些消费品工厂，如糖果厂、咸鱼加工厂、酱菜厂等。
    玉溪专区的地方工厂，是按各县的资源条件建立的。如江川是油菜的产地，就在江川建立榨油厂。如深山夹谷中的新平县有森林，有铁矿，有樟脑，就在那里建立伐木厂、小型炼铁厂和樟脑制造厂。在那些出产甘蔗的地方都建立了榨糖厂。现在玉溪地区的发电能力有九百瓩。一个小型的工业网已在玉溪专区初步形成了。
    玉溪地区的地方工业是在中共玉溪地委的领导下发展起来的。玉溪地委会在农业合作化的发展中，深切地感到没有相适应的地方工业，农业的发展就受到影响。比如种植甘蔗，近两三年来全区的甘蔗发展到四万多亩，如果用过去的土法榨糖，一年出产的甘蔗要一年时间才能榨完，这就使甘蔗的糖分减少。要解决这个问题，就需要榨糖机。榨糖机从哪里来呢？到外地买，因路程远，价格太贵，农民买不起，同时外地也难买到这么多榨糖机。唯一的办法就是自己制造。制造机器需要铁，铁怎样解决呢，从外面运来价格太贵，也很困难。这样，就需要自己从山上挖矿石，用土法炼铁。玉溪地区的一些县，多是种植烤烟的经济作物区，过去种植的烤烟少，烤烟时多用木炭。现在烤烟种植面积发展到三十万亩，再用木炭烤，一两年就会把山上的树木砍光。因此他们积极地开了四个煤矿。我曾询问这里的负责同志，开这四个煤矿用了多少钱？他们说，主要是干部带头，搭几个窝棚就干起来了，用钱有限。开采了煤，没有公路，他们就动员群众自己修公路。江川的咸鱼厂，国家一个钱没拿就建立起来了。
    在建立厂房时，他们因陋就简；在购买机器时，他们也多是购买旧机器。为了购买旧机器、破机器，他们派人到上海的一些老工厂里去摸底子。有些老工厂把旧机床作洗衣服架子，有的厂把旧机床堆在仓库里好几年没人管。有些工厂的同志把破机器当废铁卖给他们。这些旧机床、废铁，到他们手里，修理修理又成了好的了。
    玉溪铁工厂是按照勤俭办企业的方针建立起来的一个典型工厂。这个厂去年才建立起来，但已制造了够全区榨糖用的榨糖机。这种榨糖机如果从外地运来，要九千多元一台，他们制造的才三千多元一台。过去，这里的农民榨糖，用牛拉磨榨，榨出的糖叫牛粪糖，价钱虽便宜，但卖不出去。自从改成机器榨糖后，糖都成了很好的黄沙糖了，每百斤甘蔗还多出20％的糖。群众反映：只要有了榨糖机，我们就乐意种甘蔗。盛产甘蔗的元江，去年安装了三台榨糖机，今年打算再安装十三台。榨糖机的动力设备都是用破汽车的发动机改装的，还可用来轧棉花、碾米、抽水。元江有台榨糖机的发动机，半年里面只休息了三天。这个铁工厂制造了大批的打谷机、碾米机、花生剥壳机。碾米机每天能碾三万多斤米，比外地买来的多碾二万多斤。现在，这个厂正在试制水轮机和水闸，以满足农村发展水利的需要。他们试制的水轮机，只要有两公尺水的落差，就可以发电。在玉溪和云南的其他地方，可以广泛地使用这种水轮发电机。
    玉溪专区在发展地方工业中感到最突出的问题，是缺乏高级技术人员。比较复杂的机器坏了，还要运到昆明修理，有些机器修理的时间很长。现在他们经过串连，已找到散布在农村的过去的老工人，在工业学校里找到了技师。
    第二个问题是运输力量不足，不能及时地把生铁、煤、烤烟、糖运出去。为了补救运输力量的不足，他们已发展了两千辆马车。不过因为路较远，成本还很高。他们还需要一定数量的汽车。
    第三、这些地方工业规模都比较小，农忙时很忙，农闲时有的厂就没有活干。如滑泞糖厂，一年虽然可获得利润十万多元，但一年只开工三个月。他们打算采取两个办法来解决这个问题：一、使这些工人掌握多种技术，生产多种产品；二、生产时就集中工人，不生产时就把工人分散到农业社里做农活。
