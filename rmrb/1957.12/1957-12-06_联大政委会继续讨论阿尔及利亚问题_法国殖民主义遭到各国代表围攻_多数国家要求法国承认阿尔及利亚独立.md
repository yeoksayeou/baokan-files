    Soviet representative Sobolev said in his speech that the debate on the Algerian issue once again clearly showed the seriousness of the situation in Algeria. French Foreign Minister Pineau's speech proved that the French government still intends to use force to solve the Algerian issue.

Sobolev concluded by saying that the Soviet Union advocates an immediate cessation of military operations in Algeria and a peaceful resolution of the issue.

    Tunisian representative Slim said that the French "Basic Law" cannot solve the Algerian issue at all. He said that now is the time for France to abandon its erroneous notions and hold negotiations with Algerian leaders.
    Representatives from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Pakistan, Libya, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Albania, Yemen, Ghana, Afghanistan, Sudan, Romania, Belarus, Japan, Hungary, Nepal, and Jordan also spoke at the meetings on the 3rd and 4th, condemning French colonialism and supporting Algeria's desire for independence.

    联大政委会继续讨论阿尔及利亚问题
　　法国殖民主义遭到各国代表围攻
　  多数国家要求法国承认阿尔及利亚独立
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：联合国大会政治委员会3日和4日两天举行会议，继续讨论阿尔及利亚问题。许多国家谴责法国的殖民主义，支持阿尔及利亚的独立要求。
    摩洛哥代表拉腊基在发言中要求法国同阿尔及利亚进行谈判，他指出，法国只有和阿尔及利亚进行谈判才能解决问题。
    苏联代表索波列夫在发言中说，对于阿尔及利亚问题的辩论再次清楚地表明阿尔及利亚局势的严重性。法国外交部长比诺的发言证明，法国政府还打算用武力来解决阿尔及利亚问题。索波列夫指出，阿尔及利亚的军事行动最近已经越出阿尔及利亚领土之外。阿尔及利亚问题成了复杂的国际问题。他说，在这种情况下，联合国的责任就是要竭尽一切努力来制止阿尔及利亚战争。索波列夫最后说，苏联主张立即停止阿尔及利亚的军事行动和和平解决这个问题。
    埃及代表法齐说，法国必须承认阿尔及利亚人民的自决权，这种权利是不能以“凭空捏造的法律根据”来剥夺的。法齐说，给阿尔及利亚自由的时刻已经到来。
    印度尼西亚代表阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约谴责殖民国家力图使殖民主义已经被判处了的无可更改的死刑缓期执行。
    印度代表梅农说，印度愿意帮助寻求阿尔及利亚问题的解决办法，但是它决不能放弃殖民地人民独立的原则。
    突尼斯代表斯陵说，法国的“根本法”根本不能解决阿尔及利亚问题。他说，现在是法国放弃它的错误观念而同阿尔及利亚领袖们举行谈判的时候了。
    在3日和4日两天会议上发言谴责法国殖民主义、支持阿尔及利亚独立愿望的还有波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫、巴基斯坦、利比亚、乌克兰、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、也门、加纳、阿富汗、苏丹、罗马尼亚、白俄罗斯、日本、匈牙利、尼泊尔和约旦等国家的代表。
