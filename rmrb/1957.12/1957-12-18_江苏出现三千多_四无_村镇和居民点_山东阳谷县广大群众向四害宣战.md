Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 17th: More than three thousand eight hundred and sixty "four-without" villages and settlements (free of rats, flies, mosquitoes, and sparrows) have appeared in Jiangsu Province.

The mass patriotic health campaign in Jiangsu Province has not only seen new development in urban areas, but has also been widely carried out in rural areas. Over the past two years, the province has caught more than 8.82 million rats, 11.98 million sparrows, collected more than 2.48 million sparrow eggs, and dug up more than 1.337 million catties of pupae. Last year, combined with the health campaign, 853 million dan of garbage fertilizer were accumulated, supporting agricultural production.

Due to the significant reduction in mosquitoes and flies, the seasonal incidence rate in Jiangsu Province has decreased significantly. Compared to 1955, the incidence rate of typhoid and paratyphoid fever in 1956 decreased by 35%, and the incidence rate of epidemic typhus decreased by 52.7%. From January to September 1957, compared to the same period in 1956, the incidence rate of dysentery decreased by 29.9%, and the incidence rate of typhoid and paratyphoid fever decreased by 36.5%.

Through the patriotic health campaign, a new atmosphere of cleanliness and hygiene has emerged in many cities, counties, and villages in Jiangsu Province. Wangyu Village in Ganyu County is a small market town in a mountain gully. Before the health work was carried out, there was a folk saying: "The ditches can never be filled, and the stones can never be carried away." Ditches and ponds of sewage were everywhere, pigs were not kept in pens, and the stench was overwhelming. After two years of health work, the dirty streets have been transformed into clean and smooth streets. Residents have established a cleaning and hygiene system of a major cleaning every five days, which has been adhered to for two years. Wulaocun in Nanjing has worked hard to eliminate the four pests and improve environmental hygiene for several years, and has maintained the glorious title of a model of hygiene from 1952 to the present.

In order to promote the patriotic health movement to a new upsurge, many areas in Jiangsu Province have launched a winter health campaign, and the province-wide winter four pests elimination campaign will be fully launched before New Year's Day next year.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 17th: One hundred and four agricultural cooperatives in Yanggu County, Shandong Province, have launched a mass movement to eliminate the four pests in conjunction with winter production.

Within ten days of declaring war on the four pests at the beginning of December, members of these agricultural cooperatives have already caught more than 11,000 rats and sparrows, and eliminated a large number of overwintering remnant flies. More than 500 teachers and students of Yanggu Normal School in Shandong Province used their spare time to conduct reconnaissance during the day and capture at night, and caught more than 2,000 rats and sparrows and a large number of remnant flies in six days. Many doctors from the Health Workers Association of Jiangmiao District also actively took the lead in catching rats and sparrows, and spread the experience of eliminating the four pests. Cangzi District and Jiangmiao District, which have done a better job in eliminating the four pests, have recently caught more than 3,000 rats and sparrows. More than a dozen villages, including Wangyuan, Cuizhuang, Sanjiaosi, and Hanzhai in these two districts, have basically achieved being free of rats and sparrows.

Many agricultural cooperatives have also carried out a three-cleanliness campaign of indoor cleanliness, courtyard cleanliness, and cleanliness around the village in conjunction with the winter manure accumulation movement. Many townships and agricultural cooperatives also used medicated powder or sawdust to fumigate houses, and universally dug toilets, pig pens, and stinky ditches to eliminate breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies. In addition to catching rats and sparrows, twelve villages, including Dabu, Jiaohai, Xiaomihunzhen, and Shatuji in Yanggu County, have also assigned special personnel to sweep the streets and clean toilets and pig pens, striving to basically achieve the "four-without" model villages of no mosquitoes, no flies, no sparrows, and no rats in 1958.

Many agricultural cooperatives in Yanggu County have attached great importance to the work of eliminating the four pests in the past two years. From January to early December this year, the county has eliminated more than 170,600 rats and sparrows, dug up more than 1,300 catties of fly pupae, and accumulated more than 149,800 carts of manure in conjunction with the major sanitation campaign.

　　江苏出现三千多“四无”村镇和居民点
    山东阳谷县广大群众向四害宣战
    新华社南京17日电　江苏省出现三千八百六十多个无鼠、无蝇、无蚊、无雀的村镇和居民点。
    江苏省的群众爱国卫生运动，不仅在城镇有了新的发展，而且在农村也普遍开展。全省两年来共捕鼠八百八十二万多只，捕雀一千一百九十八万多只，掏雀蛋二百四十八万多个，挖蛹一百三十三万七千多斤。去年结合卫生运动还积聚垃圾肥料八亿五千三百万担，支援了农业生产。
    由于蚊蝇大大减少，江苏省季节性发病率已显著下降。以1956年同1955年比，伤寒、副伤寒发病率下降35％，斑疹伤寒发病率下降52.7％。1957年1—9月份同1956年同期比，痢疾发病率下降29.9％，伤寒、副伤寒发病率下降36.5％。
    江苏省不少市县和乡村通过爱国卫生运动，出现了讲究清洁卫生的新风气。赣榆县汪于村是一个山沟中的小集镇，在卫生工作开展前，有过这样一句民谚：“填不尽的水沟，挑不尽的石头。”到处污水沟塘，猪不归圈，臭气冲天。经过两年的卫生工作，肮脏的街道变成了清洁平滑的街道，居民订立了五天一次大扫除的清洁卫生制度，两年来一直坚持。南京市五老村几年来努力除四害，改善环境卫生，从1952年到现在一直保持卫生模范的光荣称号。
    为了将爱国卫生运动推向新高潮，江苏全省已有不少地区掀起了冬季卫生运动，全省冬季除四害运动将在明年元旦前全面展开。
    新华社济南17日电　山东省阳谷县的一百零四个农业社结合冬季生产，掀起了群众性消灭四害运动。
    这些农业社的社员们从12月初向四害宣战后的十天内，已捕捉老鼠、麻雀一万一千多只，消灭了大量过冬残蝇。山东省阳谷师范学校的五百多名师生利用课余时间，采取白天侦察、晚上捕捉的办法，六天内就捕老鼠、麻雀二千多只和大量残蝇。姜庙区卫生工作者协会的许多医生也积极带头捕鼠捕雀，传播消灭四害的经验。消灭四害较好的仓子区和姜庙区，最近又捕捉老鼠、麻雀三千多只，这两个区的王园、崔庄、三教寺、韩寨等十多个村已基本达到无鼠无雀。
    许多农业社还结合冬季积肥运动开展了屋内洁、院内洁和村庄周围洁的三洁大扫除。有不少的乡和农业社还用药粉或锯末熏房屋，普遍挖了厕所、猪圈和臭水沟，消灭蚊蝇的孳生地。阳谷县的大布、焦海、小迷魂阵和沙土集等十二个村庄，除了捕鼠捕雀以外，还确定了专人打扫街道，清理厕所、猪圈，争取1958年基本上达到无蚊、无蝇、无雀、无鼠的四无模范村。
    阳谷县的许多农业社近两年来都很重视消灭四害的工作，从今年1月份到12月上旬，全县已消灭老鼠、麻雀十七万零六百多只，挖蝇蛹一千三百多斤，结合卫生大扫除积粪十四万九千八百多车。
