　　Look, Everyone…
　　-- Attempting to Draft Explanatory Text for the Exhibition Comparing Liu Jiemei's Life Then and Now
　　Yan Ling
    One: Image
    Look, everyone, this is Liu Jiemei. Draped in tattered pieces of cloth, leaning on a long dog-beating stick, a broken basket hanging from his arm, a ragged straw hat on his head, dressed in rags, and barefoot. Behind him is a mottled, crooked, and dilapidated wall. This was the image of Liu Jiemei eight or nine years ago. Look at his face, why is he so dejected?
    Look, this is also Liu Jiemei. A gold pen in his pocket, a watch on his wrist, leather shoes on his feet, and his clothes spotless. Behind him is a tile-roofed house with lace curtains on the windows. Liu Jiemei's life has changed greatly, yet he still has a gloomy face; what is on his mind, why is he still so dissatisfied?
    Look, this is still Liu Jiemei, the Liu Jiemei of eight or nine years ago. His right hand still holds a stick, and his left hand holds a broken gourd. He squats listlessly, leaning against the stone lion at the landlord's gate. Perhaps his stomach is rumbling? He lowers his head, what is he thinking?
    Look, this is Liu Jiemei again, the most recent Liu Jiemei. He stands tall, holding his own child in his left arm, so affectionate towards the child, shaking a "rattle drum" in his right hand, his eyes full of joy. Is he smiling at the child, or is he smiling at you? Why is he so happy?
    These two large photographs and two statues, placed together, seem very unharmonious, yet seem very harmonious. What are they telling each other?
    This exhibition displays all of Liu Jiemei's innermost thoughts, let it answer you!
    Liu Jiemei himself is at this exhibition, let him answer you!

    Two: Childhood
    A carrying pole, weighing down the shoulders of Liu Jiemei's father. Two broken baskets, hanging on either end. One end held their entire family property; the other end was Liu Jiemei's "cradle."
    Liu Jiemei had not been in the world for many days when, like this, he was carried by his parents to wander outside. Leaving the suffering of Huanggang, they threw themselves into the suffering of Xishui. They became tenant farmers for the landlord Gao Bisheng, and after paying the rent each year, they had to beg for food in the surrounding villages. In windy days and snowy days, little Liu Jiemei followed his mother from door to door, miserable and wretched, year after year.
    After looking at these pictures, you may as well look at the newly taken photos over there. Look, how fat those two children are! Wearing brand-new rubber shoes on their feet and embroidered clothes on their bodies. They are Liu Jiemei's children, their faces and bodies full of joy. What are they saying, sitting carefree at the village entrance? Why are they pointing into the distance with their little fingers? Are they wondering why the commune's haystack is so big, or have they seen the water conservancy team's little red flag planted on the hillside? They have no idea that their father, at their age, was wandering somewhere!
    Over there, a large collection of furniture is displayed, colorful clothes hang on the wall, pairs of leather shoes and rubber shoes, and quilts and mattresses, one after another. The wooden child's stroller and cradle are painted red, shiny and bright. On the cradle is a photograph, a photograph of the broken bamboo basket in which Liu Jiemei slept as a child!

    Three: Bloodstains
    Blood, bright red blood! In 1930, one day in the first month of the lunar year, Liu Jiemei shed blood at the gate of the landlord Gao Bisheng.
    Little Liu Jiemei followed his mother to beg for food. The landlord's vicious dog darted out and bit Liu Jiemei's leg several times. Liu Jiemei fell to the ground. Blood flowed on the ground. Liu Jiemei cried.
    The landlord's henchman also rushed out, grabbed little Liu Jiemei's arm, lifted him high, and threw him far away. He roared fiercely: "During the New Year, you are not allowed to cry at the master's gate!" One of Liu Jiemei's arms was crippled. The gourd in Liu Jiemei's hand was broken.
    Liu Jiemei's mother, with tears in her eyes and swallowing her anger, was forced to sweep away the bloodstains on the ground. -- Bloodstains can be swept away; but who can sweep away the hatred in the heart?
    Look here! Here is the very gourd. The gourd was broken, mended, and used for so many years! -- A broken gourd can be mended; but who can mend a broken heart?
    Now you are seeing blood for the second time at this exhibition. Do you remember whose blood you saw the first time?
    It was the blood of Liu Jiemei's uncle, Liu Yicheng. Liu Yicheng worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord Liu Qingzhou. One summer, Liu Qingzhou forced Liu Yicheng to dig a half-mile-long ditch in one night; the next day, he forced him to draw water in the steepest place. Liu Yicheng coughed up blood. Blood flowed where he was drawing water. His body weakened, and his wages were reduced. A young, strong life was squeezed dry by the landlord; after working as a long-term laborer for seven and a half years, he died of exhaustion!
    Look here! These are all the possessions that this young hired farmhand exchanged for a lifetime of blood and sweat: three pieces of tattered clothing patched and re-patched, a ball of worn-out wadding, and a piece of broken mat. How many times has sweat soaked through these clothes? Think about why the sleeves are so badly torn? How many nightmares did this young hired farmhand have in this ball of worn-out wadding? And how did he tragically end his short life on this piece of broken mat?
    Look further back, there is more blood behind!
    That is not blood painted on paper, that is real blood, that is blood that flowed in July of this year!
    Look, this is a bloodstained shirt, a bloodstained knife. The bloodstained shirt was worn by Li Hongzhen, the wife of a production team leader of the Huangtugang Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing; the murder weapon was used by Liu Depu, a local tyrant landlord from the same place.
    Not long after vicious right-wing elements in the city shouted "Kill the Communists," Liu Depu frantically brandished the murder weapon and ran to the home of the production team leader Huo Bin. Only because Huo Bin had told this landlord element, who had joined the cooperative, not to be lazy, only because Huo Bin loved his agricultural cooperative!
    The blood of the working people flowed before liberation. How many martyrs sacrificed their blood and lives to ensure that the working people would no longer shed blood!
    How can we tolerate the blood of the working people flowing today?
    How can we, like Liu Jiemei not long ago, forget the days of bloodshed?

　　你们看……
　　——试为刘介梅今昔生活对比展览会拟几段解说词
　　燕凌
    一、形象
    你们看，这就是刘介梅。披着支离破碎的布片，扶着长长的打狗棒，胳膊上吊着破篮子，头上顶着破草帽，一身褴褛，两脚光光。在他背后，是斑斑驳驳歪歪斜斜的一堵烂墙。八九年前的刘介梅，就是这样一幅形象。你们看看他的脸，他为什么那么懊丧？
    你们看，这也是刘介梅。金笔插在口袋，手表戴在手腕，脚上蹬着皮鞋，衣服一尘不染。背后是瓦屋，窗子上挂着花窗帘。刘介梅的生活已经大改变，他却还是哭丧着脸；他究竟有些什么心事，还是那么不满？
    你们看，这还是刘介梅，还是八九年前的刘介梅。右手还是一根棍子，左手拿着一个破瓢。少气没力地蹲着，身子在地主家门口的石狮子上靠着。他肚子里也许正在咕咕叫吧？他低着头，在想些什么？
    你们看，这又是刘介梅，最近的刘介梅。他挺立着，左手抱着自己的孩子，对孩子那样亲，右手摇着“卜浪鼓”，眼睛里充满着欢欣。他是对孩子笑呢，还是对你笑呢？他为什么那么高兴？
    这两幅大照片和两座塑像，摆在一起，似乎很不谐调，却又似乎十分谐调。它们在互相诉说着一些什么？
    这个展览会上就陈列着刘介梅的全部心事，让它回答你吧！
    刘介梅本人就在这个展览会上，让他回答你吧！
    二、童年
    一根扁担，压上了刘介梅的父亲的肩。两个破筐，挂在两端。一头，是他们的全部家产；另一头，就是刘介梅的“摇篮”。
    刘介梅刚来到世上没有多少天，就这样，让父母带着流浪在外边。离开了黄冈的苦难，又投进了浠水的苦难。他们给地主高弼生当了佃户，每年交了租子就得四乡讨饭。大风天，大雪天，小小的刘介梅跟着母亲挨门串，凄凄惨惨，一年一年又一年。
    看了这几幅图画，不妨再看看那边新照的几张相。你看，那两个孩子长得多胖！脚上穿着崭新的胶鞋，身上穿着绣花的衣裳。他们是刘介梅的孩子，满脸满身喜气洋洋。他们无忧无虑地坐在村头说些什么？为什么用小小的手指头指着远方？是奇怪社里的稻草堆为什么那么大，还是又看见水利队的小红旗插上了山岗？他们哪知道父亲在他们这样的年纪，正在什么地方流浪？
    那边各式各样的家具摆了一大片，花花绿绿的衣服挂满墙，皮鞋胶鞋一双又一双，被子褥子一床又一床。木制的小孩坐车和摇篮，红色的油漆又光又亮。摇篮上又放着一张照片，照片上正是刘介梅小时候睡过的破箩筐！
    三、血迹
    血，鲜红的血！1930年，正月里的一天，在地主高弼生的大门口，刘介梅流了血。
    小小的刘介梅跟着母亲去要饭。地主的恶狗窜了出来，在刘介梅的腿上狠狠地咬了几口。刘介梅跌倒在地上。血，流在地上。刘介梅哭了。
    地主的狗腿子也窜了出来，抓住小刘介梅的胳膊高高提起，摔得远远的。恶狠狠地吼着：“大正月里，不许在老爷门口哭！”刘介梅的一只胳膊残废了。刘介梅手里的瓢，摔破了。
    刘介梅的母亲含着泪忍着气被逼迫着打扫地上的血迹。——血迹，可以扫掉；心头的仇恨，谁能扫掉它？
    看这里！这里摆着的就是那个瓢。瓢破了，缝起来，又用了多少年！——破瓢，可以缝补；破碎了的心，谁能缝起来？
    现在你们在这个展览会上第二次看到血。你们还记得第一次看到的是谁的血吗？
    那是刘介梅的叔父刘义成的血。刘义成给地主刘青州做长工。一年夏天，刘青州逼着刘义成一夜挖成半里长的一条水沟；第二天，又逼着他在地势最陡的地方车水。刘义成吐血了。血，流在他正在车水的地方。身体弱了，工资减了。一个年轻的强壮的生命，被地主榨干了；当了七年半长工，累死了！
    看这里！这些就是这个青年雇农用一生的血汗换来的全部财产：补了又补的三件破衣服，一团败絮，一片破席。这些衣服，浸透过多少次汗水？想想看，为什么那袖子破得特别厉害？在这团败絮中，这个青年雇农做过多少恶梦？在这片破席上，他又怎样悲惨地结束了他短促的一生？
    往后面看吧，后面还有血！
    那不是画在纸上的血，那是真的血，那是流在今年7月的血！
    看，这是一件血衣，一把染血的刀。血衣是北京郊区黄土冈农业社的一个生产组长的妻子李洪珍穿的；凶器是同一个地方的恶霸地主刘德璞用的。
    正在城里的凶恶的右派分子高喊“杀共产党”之后不久的一天，刘德璞疯狂地挥舞着凶器跑到了生产组长霍斌家里。只因为霍斌曾经叫这个入了社的地主分子不要偷懒，只因为霍斌爱自己的农业社！
    劳动者的血，流在解放以前。多少先烈曾经为了使劳动者不再流血而献出了热血和生命！
    怎能容忍劳动者的血流在今天？
    怎能像不久以前的刘介梅那样淡忘了流血的日子？
