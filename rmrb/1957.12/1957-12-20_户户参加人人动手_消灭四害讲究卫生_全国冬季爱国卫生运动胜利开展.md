　　Households Participate, Everyone Takes Action: Eliminate the Four Pests and Emphasize Hygiene
　　National Winter Patriotic Health Campaign is Successfully Launched

　　(Our Newspaper) News: The winter patriotic health campaign, centered on eliminating the four pests, with the participation of every household and the action of everyone, has been vigorously launched throughout the country. Provinces such as Anhui, Sichuan, Shanxi, Liaoning, Zhejiang, and Guizhou, which started their arrangements and mobilizations earlier, have been promoting the campaign to the masses since November. Some urban and rural areas have already seen a high tide and achieved great results. Provinces and cities (regions) such as Beijing, Shaanxi, Hubei, Guangxi, Hebei, and Xinjiang, which recently made arrangements and mobilizations, have also been actively taking action since the beginning of this month with a fighting spirit, and have been reporting victories everywhere. For example, Bengbu City, Anhui Province, launched a mass campaign to eliminate the four pests in a concentrated month-long effort starting on November 2nd. Statistics up to November 30th showed that the city eliminated more than 260,000 rats, more than 7,000 sparrows, 51.2 million mosquitoes and flies, and more than 2,000 catties of maggots and pupae. The total number of rats killed was equivalent to 105% of the city's total rat extermination for the entire year last year. Many touching events emerged during the campaign. Yan Xuezheng, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, took the lead, and the entire bureau staff took action, capturing more than 2,300 rats and more than 90,000 mosquitoes and flies in the first seven days. The city's Young Pioneers also actively participated in the campaign. Primary school student Rong Jiulong caught more than 30,000 flies in ten days. Now, within a 20-30 li radius of the city suburbs, it is not easy to find field mouse burrows. In Chengdu, young people eliminated more than 14,000 rats, more than 1.76 million mosquitoes and flies, and more than 3,000 sparrows in the first ten days of action. Zhenlai County, Jilin Province, launched a concentrated campaign to eliminate the four pests from late November. In more than 20 days, more than 1.77 million rats were captured, and three rat-free villages and seven villages with few rats (no more than five rat holes per hundred houses) emerged. During the concentrated campaign, 224 rat-catching experts emerged throughout the county. Six hundred and twenty-four students from the Second Complete Primary School in Dongping Township participated in the campaign and captured more than 107,000 rats in total. Xu Fuqu, a 14-year-old sixth-grade student, captured more than 2,000 rats alone and was rewarded by the government. The Huoqiying Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing, which has accumulated rich experience in catching sparrows, formed a sparrow-catching commando team composed of 20 young people. They competed with adults in the campaign and captured 5,800 sparrows in 20 days. After the masses in various places took action, with the large-scale elimination of overwintering mosquitoes and flies and rats and sparrows, and the improvement of environmental and personal hygiene, one "four-without" village after another emerged, and the appearance of every village changed.

　　This year's winter patriotic health campaign is being carried out on the basis of the patriotic health campaigns of the past few years. The masses have generally improved their hygiene standards, accumulated rich experience, and emerged with many model units, which are all favorable conditions. In particular, due to the publicity and implementation of the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee, the Party and government leaders at all levels in various places attach importance to the campaign, seize the favorable opportunity of winter, issue instructions and notices, organize forces, exchange experiences, and the broad masses have a deep understanding of the importance of eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, improving health standards, and realizing the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), and ensuring the smooth development of the entire socialist construction cause. With the methods of eliminating the four pests, they are enthusiastically throwing themselves into the campaign, ensuring the successful development of the campaign.

　　In this campaign, Party and government leaders at all levels in various places, according to the specific conditions of their localities, have put forward specific tasks and adopted various measures. For example, Shandong Province put forward the requirement to concentrate efforts to eliminate overwintering mosquitoes and flies and rats and sparrows, and achieve that each county has a "four-without" or "three-without" unit.

　　Shaanxi Province designated December 15th to January 15th of next year as the Winter Patriotic Health Campaign Month, combining it with a major cleanup to eliminate the four pests. Liaoning Province mobilized the masses to carry out a concentrated campaign to dig up wild rats before the ground froze to eliminate wild rats, and combined threshing, turning over granaries, and overturning stacks to exterminate domestic rats. Anhui Province decided to launch three concentrated campaigns throughout the province this winter and next spring: launch a month-long campaign to eliminate the four pests before New Year's Day to eliminate overwintering mosquitoes and flies, scoop up maggots, dig up pupae, and eliminate rats and sparrows; around the Spring Festival, combine it with the masses' habit of "sweeping away the dust" to carry out a major cleanup campaign; and carry out a concentrated campaign of about two weeks between March and April of next year to universally dig up pupae, kill residual and newborn mosquitoes and flies and their larvae, and take out sparrow eggs and capture young sparrows. In areas with endemic diseases, such as Yangzhou City, Jiangsu Province, the central content of carrying out the campaign is to do a good job in environmental sanitation, eliminate the four pests, eliminate schistosomiasis, and do a good job in manure management. Advanced units that have already eliminated the four pests have also put forward requirements and specific measures to further improve health standards.

　　In order to ensure the in-depth implementation and regularity of the campaign, Beijing, Henan, Sichuan and other provinces and cities have closely combined the elimination of the four pests, attention to hygiene with the production of industrial and mining enterprises, and winter water conservancy construction and manure accumulation. Health departments at all levels have also organized forces to go deep among the masses to provide technical guidance.

    户户参加人人动手　消灭四害讲究卫生
    全国冬季爱国卫生运动胜利开展
    本报讯　户户参加、人人动手的以除四害为中心的冬季爱国卫生运动，已在全国各地蓬勃地开展起来。布置动员较早的安徽、四川、山西、辽宁、浙江、贵州等省，从11月份起到目前止，运动已普遍地推行到群众中去。有些城乡已出现了高潮，获得了很大的成绩。最近布置动员的北京、陕西、湖北、广西、河北、新疆等省市（区），从本月初旬起，群众也以战斗的姿态，积极地行动起来，处处告捷。如安徽省蚌埠市从11月2日开始掀起群众性的除四害运动突击月，到11月30日统计，全市就消灭了老鼠二十六万多只，麻雀七千多只，蚊蝇五千一百二十万个，蛆蛹二千多斤。其中灭鼠总数相当于去年全市全年灭鼠总数的105％。在运动中涌现出很多动人的事例。市公安局长严学政带头，全局工作人员行动起来，在开始的七天中捕鼠二千三百多只，蚊蝇九万多只。全市少先队员也都积极参加运动，小学生戎九龙于十天中即捕蝇达三万多只。现在在市郊二三十里范围以内，已不容易找到田鼠洞。成都市青少年在开始行动起来的十天内，就消灭了老鼠一万四千多只，蚊蝇一百七十六万多个，麻雀三千多只。吉林省镇赉县从11月下旬开展突击除四害运动，二十多天中就捕鼠一百七十七万多只，出现了三个无鼠屯，七个少鼠屯（每百间房屋内不超过五个鼠洞）。全县在突击运动中涌现了捕鼠能手二百二十四人。东屏乡第二完全小学六百二十四人参加运动，共捕鼠十万七千多只，六年级学生十四岁的徐复衢一个人就捕鼠二千多只，受到政府的奖励。积累有丰富捕雀经验的北京市郊区火器营农业社，由二十名青少年组成的捕雀突击队，他们在运动中和成年人比赛，在二十天内就捕雀五千八百只。各地群众行动起来以后，随着大量越冬蚊蝇和鼠雀的被消灭，环境卫生和个人卫生的改进，一个接一个的四无村相继出现，村村面貌改观。
    今年冬季爱国卫生运动由于是在过去几年爱国卫生运动的基础上开展，群众的卫生水平有了普遍的提高，积累了丰富的经验，涌现出很多模范单位，这些都是有利条件。特别是由于党的三中全会精神的宣传贯彻，各地各级党政领导方面对运动重视，紧紧地抓住冬季的有利时机，分别颁发指示、通知，组织力量，交流经验，广大群众深刻认识到除四害、讲卫生、提高健康水平和实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），保证整个社会主义建设事业顺利发展的重要意义，又有了除四害的办法，都热情的投入运动，保证了运动胜利的开展。
    在这次运动中，各地各级党政领导同志根据当地的具体情况，都提出了具体的任务，采取各种措施。如山东省提出的要求是集中力量消灭过冬蚊蝇和鼠雀，达到每县有一个四无或三无的单位。
    陕西省划定从12月15日到明年1月15日为冬季爱国卫生运动月，结合大扫除以消灭四害。辽宁省动员群众在封冻前进行一次挖野鼠的突击活动，消灭野鼠。并结合打场、翻仓、倒垛以扑灭家鼠。安徽省决定今冬明春在全省范围内开展三次突击运动：在元旦以前开展一次除四害突击月运动，消灭越冬蚊蝇、捞蛆、挖蛹、消灭鼠雀；春节前后，结合群众“扫尘”习惯，开展一次大扫除运动；明年3、4月间开展两周左右突击活动，普遍挖蛹、捕杀残留和新生蚊蝇及其幼虫，掏麻雀蛋并捕捉幼雀。有地方病的地方，如江苏省扬州市就以搞好环境卫生、除四害和消灭血吸虫病、做好粪便管理工作作为开展运动的中心内容。已经消灭了四害的先进单位，也都提出了进一步提高卫生水平的要求和具体措施。
    为了保证运动的深入贯彻和经常化，北京、河南、四川等省市，都把除四害、讲卫生和工矿企业的生产，及冬季兴修水利、积肥等生产工作密切地结合起来。各级卫生部门并组织力量，深入群众进行技术指导。
