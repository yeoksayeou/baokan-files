    "Satellite Hairstyle"
    Since the Soviet Union launched its artificial satellite, a "satellite hairstyle" has become popular among women in West Germany. This hairstyle won an award at a competition in Frankfurt. The illustration shows a delicate small motor hidden in the woman's hair, causing the "satellite" model on her head to rotate continuously. It is said that wearing such a small machine on the head does not cause any discomfort.

    “卫星发式”
    自苏联发射人造卫星后，西德妇女兴起了一种“卫星发式”。这种发式曾在法兰克福的比赛会上获得奖状。图示：在女人头发里藏有一个精致的小发动机，使她的头上的“卫星”模型不断地转着圈子。据说，在头上按装着这么一套小机器并没有使人感到有什么不舒服。
