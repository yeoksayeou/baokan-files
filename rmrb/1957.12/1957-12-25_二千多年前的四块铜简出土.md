Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, December 24th. The Anhui Province Cultural Relics Survey Team recently collected four bronze slips unearthed from Qiujia Garden, Jiuli Township, Shouxian County, Shuangqiao District, dating back over two thousand years, bearing the inscription "Grand Marshal Shao Yang Defeated Jin at Xiangling." According to archaeologists, this is a startlingly important discovery in Chinese archaeology. These four bronze slips have inscriptions inlaid with gold wire. Three of the bronze slips have nine lines of inscriptions, with eighteen characters per line, while the other has ten lines, also with eighteen characters per line. The slips unearthed in China from over two thousand years ago were all made of bamboo or wood, with the most characters on each piece being only a few dozen, and mostly handwritten. Bronze slips with gold-inlaid characters and inscriptions of over one hundred characters are extremely rare.

The survey team also collected massive bronze artifacts from the early Western Zhou Dynasty, such as *zun*, *dan*, *gu*, *jue*, *li*, and from the Spring and Autumn Period, such as *ding*, *yan*, Long and Tiger Pattern *zun*, and Taotie Pattern *zun*, from Funan County and Tongguanshan. Among them, the Long and Tiger Pattern *zun* and Taotie Pattern *zun* are magnificent in shape and exquisite in their patterns, especially the dragon and tiger reliefs on the Long and Tiger Pattern *zun*, which are lifelike. The shape and patterns of the *ding* are distinct from those of Western Zhou bronzes. These bronzes are also of great significance for studying Chinese bronze culture.

In addition, the survey team also discovered more than fifty Neolithic sites in Shouxian County and collected many cultural relics. Neolithic sites and cultural relics were also discovered this year in Jianggong Mountain, Wuhu.

    二千多年前的四块铜简出土
    新华社合肥24日电　安徽省文物普查队最近在寿县双桥区采集到这个县的九里乡丘家花园出土的二千多年前的“大司马邵阳败晋于襄陵”的铜简四块。据考古学家谈，这是我国考古学上惊人的重要发现。这四块铜简上面有用金丝错嵌的铭文，其中三块铜简上都有铭文九行，每行十八字，另一块铭文十行，也是每行十八字。我国现已出土的二千多年前的书简，都是用竹木制成，每片文字多的仅数十字，而且多是书写的；铜制而且金丝嵌字、铭文达一百字以上的简，非常罕见。
    这个普查队还在阜南县、铜官山两地采集到西周早期的尊、单、觚、爵、鬲和春秋时期的鼎甗、龙虎纹尊、饕餮纹尊等巨大铜器。其中龙虎纹尊，饕餮纹尊造型雄伟，花纹精致，特别是龙虎纹尊上的龙虎浮雕，栩栩如生。鼎的形状和花纹，与西周铜器都别具风格。这些铜器对于研究我国青铜器文化，也具有重大意义。
    另外，普查队还在寿县发现新石器时代遗址五十多处，采集到许多文物。芜湖蒋公山今年也曾发现新石器时代的遗址和文物。
