Deepen Propaganda Everyone Take Action
Beijing Eliminates the Four Pests and Emphasizes Hygiene

This newspaper reports that Beijing is carrying out a winter campaign to "eliminate the four pests and emphasize hygiene." Starting from December 3rd, the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee successively convened mobilization meetings for the winter campaign to "eliminate the four pests and emphasize hygiene" in residential areas, service industries, schools, the food and beverage industry, municipal-level government offices, and central government offices. Responsible comrades from the Beijing Party and government delivered mobilization reports at each mobilization meeting. Deputy Mayor Wang Kunlun and others also went to the suburbs to mobilize farmers to participate in the campaign. At the mobilization meeting for central government agencies and military systems, Zeng Yifan, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council, requested that central-level state organs must accept the leadership of municipal and district health departments and accept the supervision and inspection of sanitation work by street offices during the Patriotic Health Campaign. During the mobilization process, the city vigorously launched publicity activities. The Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee produced 130,000 copies of propaganda materials, including texts and cartoons, erected huge propaganda boards at important street intersections, and distributed pictures of pest elimination to various districts for touring exhibitions in various streets. Starting from the 7th, 40 cinemas began to show slides on "Eliminating the Four Pests and Emphasizing Hygiene," and a propaganda team composed of blind artists went to the suburbs to sing quyi programs about hygiene. Starting from the 12th, broadcast propaganda vehicles went to densely populated areas in various districts to conduct publicity, and suburban wired broadcasting stations also broadcast special programs on "Eliminating the Four Pests and Emphasizing Hygiene" for 15 minutes every day. Various districts also held small-scale photo exhibitions, using street blackboards, shop windows, and posters to promote to the masses.

So far, most districts in Beijing have formulated specific work plans for the winter campaign to "eliminate the four pests and emphasize hygiene," and have implemented the plan requirements at the grassroots level. Districts such as Xisi and Dongsi mobilized neighborhood committee directors, members, and team leaders to discuss the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) to increase confidence in doing a good job in the winter campaign to "eliminate the four pests and emphasize hygiene." After a series of mobilization arrangements and various forms of publicity and education, many areas have taken active action.

Xuanwu District launched the work of poisoning rats with "Antu" throughout the district on December 2nd. More than 37,000 households have been treated for the first time, accounting for more than 62% of the total number of households in the district. The street offices of Yao'er Hutong, Tianqiao, and Zixin Road in this district have done the best job in poisoning and killing rats. A total of more than one million grains of poisoned bait mixed with "Antu" were distributed in the district, and 16% of the poisoned bait was eaten by rats. More than 2,200 poisoned rats were found dead outside the burrows in the district. At the same time, residents also used clamps and other tools to capture more than 1,600 rats. The district is now preparing to carry out the second poisoning and rat extermination work. Residents in Dongdan District caught more than 2,100 rats in the first week of December. Farmers and residents in Wanshou Temple Township in Haidian District all carried out a thorough cleaning. A large number of overwintering flies and mosquitoes were eliminated during the cleaning. More than 40 agricultural production teams in Dongran Village Township in Haidian District have established four-pest elimination and capture teams. After two weeks of blitz, the township eliminated more than 16,000 sparrows, more than 4,000 rats, and a large number of flies and mosquitoes. The Huoqiying in this township can hardly see any sparrows anymore. Tiancun, Gucheng and other townships in Shijingshan District used the method of fumigation with 666 powder in more than 1,000 houses to eliminate a large number of overwintering flies.

　　深入宣传　人人动手
    北京市除四害讲卫生
    本报讯　北京市开展冬季“除四害、讲卫生”运动。从12月3日起，北京市爱国卫生运动委员会连续召开了居民、服务行业、学校、饮食行业、市级机关和中央机关等系统冬季“除四害、讲卫生”运动动员大会。北京市有关党、政负责同志，分别在各次动员大会上作了动员报告。王昆仑副市长等并到郊区，动员农民参加运动。在中央机关和军事系统动员大会上，国务院曾一凡副秘书长要求中央级国家机关，在爱国卫生运动中，必须接受市、区卫生部门的领导，接受街道办事处对卫生工作的监督检查。在动员过程中，全市大张旗鼓地展开了宣传活动。北京市爱国卫生运动委员会制作了十三万份文字和漫画等宣传材料，在各重要街口上树起巨大的宣传牌，并发给各区除四害图片，在各街道巡回展览。从7日开始，四十家电影院着手放映“除四害、讲卫生”幻灯片，由盲艺人组成的宣传队，到各郊区去演唱关于讲卫生的曲艺节目。从12日开始，广播宣传车到各区人口密集的地方进行宣传，郊区有线广播站每天也有十五分钟播送“除四害、讲卫生”的特别节目。各区还举行小型图片展览，利用街头黑板报、商店橱窗和张贴标语等各种方式向群众展开宣传。
    到目前止，北京市的大部区都制订了冬季“除四害、讲卫生”运动的具体工作计划，并且把计划要求贯彻到基层。西四、东四等区发动居民主任、委员、组长等，讨论全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），以增加搞好冬季“除四害、讲卫生”运动的信心。经过一系列的动员布置和各种各样的宣传教育，许多地区已经积极行动起来。
    宣武区从12月2日就在全区开展了用“安妥”毒鼠工作。作了第一次投药的有三万七千多户，占全区户数的62％以上。这个区的鹞儿胡同、天桥和自新路等街道办事处的投药灭鼠工作做得最好，全区共投了一百多万粒拌了“安妥”的毒饵，16％的毒饵被老鼠吃掉。全区发现有二千二百多只中了毒的老鼠死在鼠洞外边。同时，居民们还用夹子等工具捕捉了一千六百多只老鼠。该区现在正准备进行第二次投药灭鼠工作。东单区的居民在12月的第一周内，都捕到二千一百多只老鼠。海淀区万寿寺乡的农户和居民住户，全部进行了一次清洁大扫除。扫除中消灭了大量过冬的苍蝇、蚊子。海淀区东冉村乡四十多个农业生产队，都成立了除四害捕打队。全乡经过两个星期的突击，共消灭了一万六千多只麻雀，四千多只老鼠和大量的苍蝇、蚊子。这个乡的火器营，已经基本上看不到麻雀了。石景山区田村、古城等乡，在一千多间房子里，用六六六药粉烟熏的方法，消灭了大量的过冬苍蝇。
