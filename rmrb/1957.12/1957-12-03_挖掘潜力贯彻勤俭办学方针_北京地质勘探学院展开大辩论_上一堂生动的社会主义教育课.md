　　Digging Potential, Implementing the Guiding Principle of Building the Country and Running Schools Through Diligence and Frugality
　  Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration Launches Major Debate, Providing a Vivid Lesson in Socialist Education

　　(Our report) The Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration, focusing on the principle of "building the country diligently and thriftily, running schools diligently and thriftily," has launched a debate on specific issues that urgently need to be resolved, such as books, specimens, production internships, teaching equipment, and saving coal and electricity.

　　The issue of books and specimens was the first to be revealed during this major debate. Due to the Party committee's full mobilization of the masses, a "book return movement" and a "major specimen inspection" climax were launched in a short period of one or two weeks, returning more than 13,000 books and properly handling a large number of stockpiled specimens.

　　Regarding the issue of saving coal and electricity, the discussion among the students was the most enthusiastic and profound, resulting in the greatest ideological gains. At a student forum held by the student union, the central issues of the big-character posters' discussion on saving coal and electricity over the past three weeks were concentrated. By criticizing the incorrect views and attitudes of a very few individuals towards evening self-study, distinguishing right from wrong, and clarifying the correct attitude and methods for handling problems, the socialist enthusiasm of the masses was greatly enhanced, leading this debate into a new stage of specifically resolving practical problems.

　　Currently, many classes, in order to achieve the target of 90 kilowatts of electricity per hour, are using the attitude of "masters of the institute, successors of the country" to actively use their brains and take action. They have proposed more and more effective constructive suggestions for saving all national resources that can be saved and tapping all potential that can be tapped. The fourth class of the second-year special class of metal geophysics, after several discussions and inspections in the class, found many loopholes in the current method of allocating self-study classrooms. They suggested re-adjusting the self-study classrooms to plug these loopholes. The whole class also passed four guarantees and resolutions on saving coal and electricity and proposed to all students in the institute to have one lamp per room, not to turn on the heating in student dormitories except in particularly cold weather, to insist on winter sports, and not to sleep in.

　　Big-character posters also put forward opinions and proposals on reclaiming the school's wasteland, greening the campus, and overcoming food waste. A big-character poster entitled "Hoping that the Administration Section and the Teaching Equipment Section Will Follow the Example of the Library" posted in the former General Affairs Department's "Mingfang Garden" revealed many unreasonable practices in the use of public property in the past. For example, four purchasing staff in the supply section each had a pair of rubber boots, a leather coat, and a velvet hat, which were worn when going out for procurement. However, last winter, these four people did not go out for procurement, but they wore public leather coats every day. Someone suggested to the equipment section that they should not be returned, allowing them to be used for a long time. In addition, there were cases of borrowing public raincoats for five years without returning them, and arbitrarily moving public furniture, causing chaos in the distribution.

　　In terms of teaching, everyone debated issues such as exercise classes and examinations. The first class of the second-year special class of petroleum geophysics believed that the math exercise class teacher did not explain the problems clearly in class, and the requirements were not clear. Students did not understand, and after class, the impression was sometimes hazy, and the gains were small. They asked the instructors to strengthen their sense of responsibility and clarify the purpose of each exercise class. The fifth class of the fourth grade of the hydrogeology department proposed that exam questions in the past were always in the order of the lecture topics, with major questions being major topics and minor questions being minor topics, so that students would memorize the notes whenever they took the exam; professional courses and other courses with more content need a longer review time; the evaluation of exam results should be combined with usual performance; and regulations should be established for dealing with lateness, leave, and early departure. At the beginning of the major debate, the sports team opened a battlefield in the "Mingfang Garden" and boldly revealed the erroneous guiding ideology of the teaching of the instructor Zhao Jinlong and the style of championism.

　　Currently, the rectification movement of the Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration will shift to focusing on rectifying learning discipline and revising and implementing examination procedures, launching a major ideological debate.

### 挖掘潜力贯彻勤俭办学方针  北京地质勘探学院展开大辩论　上一堂生动的社会主义教育课

　　挖掘潜力贯彻勤俭办学方针
　  北京地质勘探学院展开大辩论　上一堂生动的社会主义教育课
    本报讯　北京地质勘探学院围绕着“勤俭建国、勤俭办校”的方针，对图书、标本、生产实习、教学设备及节约煤电等迫切需要解决的具体问题展开了辩论。
    图书和标本的问题，是这次大辩论中最先揭发出来的问题。由于党委充分发动了群众，因而在短短的一两周内便掀起了一个“还书运动”和“标本大检查”的高潮，使一万三千多本图书还了家，大批积压的标本得到适当的处理。
    关于节约煤电的问题，这次在同学中讨论得最为热烈和深刻，因而思想收获也是最大的。在学生会召开的学生座谈会上，集中反映了三周以来，大字报有关节约煤电讨论的中心问题，通过对极个别人对待晚自习问题的不正确看法和态度的批判，分清是非，明确了正确处理问题的态度和方法，从而大大地提高了群众的社会主义积极性，把这一辩论引向具体解决实际问题的新阶段。
    目前，许多班级，为了达到每小时用电九十瓩的指标，正以“学院的主人翁，国家的接班人”的姿态，开动脑筋，积极行动起来，为节约一切可能节约的国家资财，挖掘一切可能挖掘的潜力，而提出了更多和更有效的节约煤电的建设性建议。金属物探二年级特别班四班的同学，经过了班上多次讨论和检查，发现现行分配自习教室的方式有不少漏洞，他们建议重新调整自习教室以堵塞这些漏洞。全班还通过四项节约煤电的保证和决议，并向全院同学提出一室一灯，除特别严寒外，学生宿舍起床和睡觉全部不开暖气，坚持冬季体育锻炼，不睡懒觉等倡议。
    在大字报上还提出了开垦学校荒地、绿化校园和克服浪费粮食等意见和倡议。在原总务处鸣放园地上贴的一张题为“希望行政科、教学设备科向图书馆看齐”的大字报，揭发了过去有很多公物在使用上的不合理做法。如供应科四名采购员每人一双胶靴、一件皮衣、绒帽，这些东西是外出采购时穿的。可是去年一冬天，这四人也未外出采购，但是他们天天穿着公家的皮大衣，有人向设备科提出也不收回，任他们长期使用。此外，还有借用公家雨衣五年未还的，有随便搬用公家家俱造成分配上的紊乱状况等等。
    在教学方面，大家对习题课和考试考查等问题展开辩论。石油物探系二年级特别班一班认为数学习题课老师在课堂上提问题没有交代清楚，要求目的也不明确，同学听不懂，下课后印象有时是茫茫然，收获很少，要求指导老师加强责任感，明确每一节习题课的目的性。水文系四年级五班提出，考试题目过去总是按照讲课的标题顺序，大题就是大标题，小题就是小标题，使同学每当考试就照笔记背；专业课和内容较多的其他课需要有较长复习时间；考试成绩的评定要结合平时；迟到、请假、早退应定出处理的规章制度等。体育代表队在大辩论一开始，就在鸣放园地上开辟了战场，对赵金龙指导教师在教学上的错误指导思想，和锦标主义的作风进行了大胆的揭露。
    目前，北京地质勘探学院的整风运动，将转入以整顿学习纪律，修订和贯彻考试考查规程为中心，展开思想大辩论。
