Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 21st: After inspecting the current rural work, the person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China gave important instructions to relevant staff on the 18th on how to organize and lead the winter production upsurge.

The person in charge of the Provincial Party Committee said: After the Provincial Party Congress and the Four-Level Cadre Meeting, about 700,000 laborers are now engaged in water conservancy construction every day throughout the province, and the manure accumulation campaign is also underway. The main task now is to further mobilize the masses, promote their enthusiasm, and set off a winter production upsurge throughout the province. Therefore, we must pay attention to some dead spots and mobilize the masses from all aspects to promote those areas that think their enthusiasm is already high, but is actually far from enough. We must educate everyone to compare with the good, to compare with the advanced, not to compare with history. He said that by the end of the year or the beginning of next month, the movement should be pushed to a second peak, mainly to exchange experiences, commend and introduce the advanced, so that the movement can avoid detours. We must commend good experiences where one worker can do the work of two, and one yuan can be used as two. At the same time, we must also publicly criticize those individuals, cooperatives, townships, and counties that are not energetic enough, numb, claim to be advanced, but are lagging behind others.

The person in charge of the Provincial Party Committee said: We must implement the general line of "more, faster, better, and more economical." The "more, faster, better, and more economical" policy is unified. However, there should be a focus in guidance. It is not accurate to only talk about expanding the irrigated area by so many mu. It should be explained: first, how much water is available; second, how much land can be irrigated; third, how much labor was used; fourth, how much money was spent; fifth, what is the quality. Of course, we must look at the natural conditions of each place, and we cannot compare generally, but we cannot just talk vaguely about how many mu can be irrigated without calculating "better" and "more economical." Therefore, water conservancy design should pay attention to minimizing the inundation of farmland. And the most important thing is to be good at organizing labor. If organized well, efficiency can be increased by one or two times. Money and labor are limited resources, which must be valued and not wasted. We must prevent waste that may occur when enthusiasm rises.

The person in charge of the Provincial Party Committee said: The fertilizer problem, like water conservancy, also requires "more" and "faster." At the beginning of next month, we will introduce some major experiences, summarize the methods suitable for plains or mountainous areas, and conduct experiments in several counties next spring to see how much effect grass ash, green manure, barnyard manure, and old mud walls actually have. The province should also actively develop chemical fertilizers, especially nitrogen fertilizer. Because the later it gets, the more difficult the fertilizer situation becomes, and it is imperative to develop chemical fertilizers.

The person in charge of the Provincial Party Committee said that in winter production, in addition to water conservancy and manure accumulation, we should also pay attention to sideline occupations and processing of minor spring crops, and allocate a certain amount of manpower to discuss the Forty Articles of the Development Program. Preparations for spring plowing should also be made early. Therefore, all levels should organize command posts to lead winter production, make full use of telephone conferences, organize supervision and inspection, send work teams to help exchange experiences, and strengthen production guidance for border minority areas. Cadres transferred from agencies should arrive at their production posts as soon as possible.

### 教育群众比先进不比历史  领导冬季生产中要注意改变那些以先进自居的死角

    教育群众比先进不比历史
    领导冬季生产中要注意改变那些以先进自居的死角
    据新华社昆明21日电  中共云南省委负责人在检查了当前农村工作后，18日对有关工作人员就如何组织和领导冬季生产高潮问题，作了重要指示。
    省委负责人说：省的党代表大会和四级干部会议以后，现在全省每天约有七十万劳动力投入水利建设，积肥运动也正在展开。当前的主要任务是要进一步发动群众，发扬群众的积极性，在全省范围内掀起冬季生产的高潮。因此，必须注意一些死角，从各方面发动群众，推动那些自以为积极性已经很高而其实还很不够的地区，必须教育大家要和好的比，要比先进，不要比历史。他说，到年底或下月初，应该把运动推向第二个高峰，主要是交流经验，表扬和介绍先进，使运动少走弯路。要表扬那些一个工能顶两个工的，一块钱能顶两块钱用的好经验。同时，也要公开批评那些劲头不足，麻木不仁，自己讲先进、比别人就落后的个别的人、社、乡和县。
    省委负责人说：必须贯彻执行多快好省的方针，“多快好省”的方针是统一的。但是，指导上要有重点。如果只讲扩大灌溉面积多少亩，就不准确。应该说明：一，有了多少水，二，能灌多少田，三，用了多少工，四，花了多少钱，五，质量如何。当然要看各地的自然条件，不能一般的比，但也不能笼统地只讲能灌多少亩，而不计算好和省。因此水利设计，要注意尽量少淹田地。而最重要的是要善于组织劳动力，组织得好，效率可以提高一、二倍。钱和劳动力都是有限的资源，必须宝贵，不能浪费，要防止积极性一起来，可能出现的浪费。
    省委负责人说：肥料问题，和水利一样，也要求多和快。下月初，就要介绍一些主要的经验，把那些适合于平地或山区的办法加以总结，明春就在若干县内试验，看草灰、绿肥、厩肥、老土墙泥，究竟起多大的作用。省里还要积极发展化学肥料，特别是氮肥。因为愈到后来，肥料就愈有困难，非发展化学肥料不可。
    省委负责人说，冬季生产中，除了水利和积肥，还应当注意到副业和小春加工，并要分出一定力量来讨论发展纲要四十条。春耕工作也要早作准备。因此，各级都要组织指挥部领导冬季生产，充分利用电话会议，要组织督促和检查，派工作队下去帮助交流经验，并应加强对边疆少数民族地区的生产指导。机关下放的干部，应当及早到达生产岗位。
