    Guangdong Newly Opens Over 30,000 Mu of Tea Gardens
    This year, Guangdong Province has opened up more than 32,000 mu of barren mountains and wasteland into tea gardens. These tea gardens are being sown successively, and new tea can be picked in about three to four years.
    Since the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a decision in September this year to vigorously promote mountain production, the tea farmers' enthusiasm for production has been even higher. Tea industry cooperatives have organized manpower to survey the terrain, climb over mountains and ridges, and cultivate and plant.
    In order to support tea farmers' production, the Provincial Department of Agriculture has specially transferred more than 1,000 dan of famous tea seeds such as "Yunnan Pu'er" and "Raoping Narcissus". Relevant departments in Panyu, Lingshan and other counties have also allocated 210,000 yuan in loans to help farmers with financial difficulties.
    Last year, the tea planting area in Guangdong Province was 160,000 mu, and now it has reached more than 192,000 mu, which is more than 30,000 mu higher than the highest level of 1933 before the War of Resistance Against Japan. (Li Shaoqiu)

    广东新辟茶园三万多亩
    今年广东省已经有三万二千多亩荒山荒地开辟成了茶园。这些茶园正在陆续播种，大约三、四年后即可采摘新茶。
    今年9月，中共广东省委发布了大力繁荣山区生产的决定后，各地茶农生产热情更加高涨，茶业社纷纷组织人力，翻山越岭地去勘察地形，开垦种植。
    为了支援茶农生产，省农业厅特地调进了一千多担“云南普洱”，“饶平水仙”等名贵茶叶种子，番禺、灵山等县有关部门还拨出了二十一万元贷款，帮助资金困难的农民。
    广东省去年茶叶种植面积有十六万亩，到现在已达到十九万二千亩以上，比抗战前1933年最高水平还要超过三万多亩。（李少球）
