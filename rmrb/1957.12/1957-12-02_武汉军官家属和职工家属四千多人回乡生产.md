　　Wuhan (By Our Reporter) More than 4,000 family members of military officers stationed in Wuhan and staff members in Wuhan, comprising 2,125 households, have already returned to their hometowns.

　　Party committees at all levels have attached great importance to mobilizing family members to return to their hometowns for production, and have organized forums for military officers, staff members, and their families to discuss the matter. Comrade Ji Yan, the wife of the principal of a certain military school, said: "I joined the revolution in 1942. During the difficult years of war, I never bargained about any decision made by the Party. This time, the Party is calling on the family members of military personnel to return to their hometowns for production and employment. I resolutely respond to the Party's call and return to production." Chu Xiuzhi, the wife of a military officer in a certain unit, was originally a model producer at home and was later named a "Five-Good" model family member after coming to the unit. After hearing the news about mobilizing family members to return to their hometowns for production, she took the initiative to discuss the matter with her husband and decided to return to her hometown for production.

　  武汉军官家属和职工家属四千多人回乡生产
    本报讯　驻武汉部队的军官家属和武汉职工家属，已经有二千一百二十五户还乡，约四千多人。
    各级党委对动员家属回乡生产十分重视，分别组织了军官、职工和家属座谈会，进行讨论。某军事学校校长的爱人姬宴同志说：“我1942年就参加革命了，在艰苦战争的岁月中，对党的决定，我从来没讲过任何价钱。这次党又号召随军家属还乡生产，劳动就业，我坚决响应党的号召，回到生产中去。”某部军官的家属褚秀芝原在家里是一级生产模范，到部队后又被评为“五好”模范家属。她这次听到动员家属还乡生产的消息后，就主动和爱人商量，决心回乡生产。
