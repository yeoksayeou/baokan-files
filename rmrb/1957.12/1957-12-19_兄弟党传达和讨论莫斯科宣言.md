　　乔治乌—德治向党积极分子讲话
    莫斯科宣言具有伟大理论和实际意义
Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 18th: A conference of Party activists from the city of Bucharest and the Bucharest region was held in the Romanian capital on the 16th to discuss the declaration and peace manifesto of the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries. Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, delivered a report at the meeting.

Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej said that the conference of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries proved that these fraternal parties hold consistent views on the basic theoretical and practical issues of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The declaration adopted at the conference has invaluable theoretical and practical significance for the Communist and Workers' parties of all countries. It gives a clear direction to the forces opposing imperialism and fighting for democracy and socialism.

Our party fully agrees with the declaration of the conference of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries. The personal experience of the Romanian people proves that the cooperation between socialist countries and the Soviet Union's multifaceted fraternal assistance to Romania have greatly helped the Romanian people's socialist construction, enabling them to achieve tremendous achievements in the economic, social, and cultural development of the country in the shortest possible time.

The experience of the people of all countries building socialism shows that the solidarity of the socialist camp is a guarantee of the independence and sovereignty of socialist countries. Further strengthening this solidarity is entirely in the national interests of these countries.

In his report, he also pointed out the importance of opposing revisionism and dogmatism. He said that the Moscow Declaration emphasizes that revisionism is the main danger at the present stage. The activities of the Nagy traitor group clearly demonstrate how revisionists in the socialist camp are trying to oppose the principles of socialism. They abandoned the Marxist-Leninist doctrine of class struggle at the decisive juncture of the transition from capitalism to socialism. The Moscow Declaration's criticism of revisionism is a valuable contribution to protecting the purity of Marxist-Leninist doctrine. Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej finally said that Party organizations and members should widely bring these documents to the masses.

The attendees welcomed and fully agreed with the two declarations with excitement and encouragement.

　　兄弟党传达和讨论莫斯科宣言
    乔治乌—德治向党积极分子讲话
    莫斯科宣言具有伟大理论和实际意义
    据新华社布加勒斯特18日电　罗马尼亚首都16日召开了布加勒斯特市和布加勒斯特州的党积极分子会议，讨论社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言和和平宣言。罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会第一书记乔治乌—德治在会上作了报告。
    乔治乌—德治说，社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议证明，这些兄弟党在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的基本理论和实践问题上的观点是一致的。会议所通过的宣言，对各国共产党和工人党都有非常珍贵的理论和实际意义。它给了反对帝国主义、争取民主和社会主义的力量以明确的方向。
    我们党完全同意社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言。罗马尼亚人民的亲身经验证明，社会主义国家之间的合作和苏联对罗马尼亚多方面的兄弟援助在很大程度上帮助了罗马尼亚人民的社会主义建设，使他们能够在最短的时期内在国家的经济、社会和文化发展中取得巨大的成就。
    正在建设社会主义的各国人民的经验表明，社会主义阵营国家的团结是社会主义各国的独立和主权的保证。进一步加强这种团结完全符合这些国家的民族利益。
    他在报告中还指出了反对修正主义和教条主义的重要意义。他说，莫斯科宣言中强调指出了修正主义是现阶段的主要危险。纳吉背叛集团的活动，清楚地证明了社会主义阵营中的修正主义分子怎样竭力反对社会主义的原则。他们在从资本主义向社会主义过渡的决定性关头放弃了马克思列宁主义关于阶级斗争的学说。莫斯科宣言对修正主义的批判是对保护马克思列宁主义学说的纯洁的一个宝贵贡献。乔治乌—德治最后说，党的组织和党员应当把这些文件广泛地带到群众中去。
    到会者以兴奋鼓舞的心情表示欢迎和完全同意这两个宣言。

    他的发言中有很大一部分谈到莫斯科会议通过的两个宣言。他说，反对新战争准备和保卫和平——就是这两个文件的共同点。
    志贺义雄继续说，共产党和工人党代表会议证明：世界上有足以保卫和平和抗击那种挑拨战争的企图的力量。
    他最后说，爱好和平的日本人民全心全意地欢迎这两个历史性的文件，日本共产党将竭尽力量向一切正直的人们传达这两个文件，并且使日本人民更加紧密地团结起来，为争取和平和民族独立而斗争。
