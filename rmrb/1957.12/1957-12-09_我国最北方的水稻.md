　　China's Northernmost Rice
　　By Our Correspondent Kang Weizhong
　　Heilongjiang Province's agricultural production plan requires that within the next ten years, one million hectares of paddy fields be developed. Coupled with other measures to increase production, it is entirely possible to increase the average yield per mu from the current 192 jin to the "Forty Articles" requirement of 400 jin by 1967.
    It is commonly thought that rice is only a crop of the South. The actual situation is not like that. In Heilongjiang Province, the northeasternmost part of China, paddy fields are being developed on a large scale. In this province, from the river-entwined and mountainous Mudanjiang area in the south, to the Heilongjiang River bordering the Soviet Union in the north in Heihe and Huma counties, from the low-lying areas along the Songhua and Nenjiang rivers in the west, to the remote foothills of the Lesser Khingan and Wanda Mountains in the east, almost every county and township in the province cultivates paddy fields.
    According to historical records, during the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty, a Korean farmer named Cui Zhuzhang reclaimed wasteland and trial-planted paddy fields in Ningguta (now Ning'an County) in southern Heilongjiang Province. This broke the "mystery" that rice could not be grown in the cold regions of Northeast China, and farmers began to collect seeds and plant paddy fields everywhere. However, planting paddy fields requires water for irrigation. In the old society, farmers did not have the resources to build water conservancy projects. Each household could only plant three or five mu along river ditches, lakes, or in waterlogged areas, drawing water for irrigation nearby. It is no wonder that the development of rice in Heilongjiang before liberation was as slow as a tortoise. In 1944, the year with the highest rice development in the province, the sown area was only 110,000 hectares. After liberation, the Party and the government understood the farmers' urgent demands for developing rice and took several measures to encourage farmers to plant rice, such as providing preferential treatment in water conservancy construction and agricultural tax rates (no tax for three years of reclamation, the same tax rate for paddy fields and dry land). After the establishment of advanced agricultural cooperatives throughout the province in 1956, the development of rice increased dramatically and linearly; in that year, 124,000 hectares were developed (bringing the total to 290,000 hectares), exceeding the total rice development in the forty years before liberation.
    The development of rice depends on water conservancy projects. In that year, 1,021 ponds and dams were built, and more than 200 main irrigation canals were constructed. Five reservoirs were also built in Ning'an, Gannan, Muling, Shangzhi, Tonghe and other counties. More than 500 mechanical pumping irrigation stations were built and equipped with 700 pumps for irrigation. In 1957, water conservancy construction saw new developments. The large-scale construction of water conservancy projects resulted in rice crops spreading throughout the province. Lanxi, Wangkui, Zhaozhou, Zhaoyuan and other counties, which had never grown rice, began to plant rice; even Sunwu and Xunke, located on the Sino-Soviet border at 53 degrees north latitude, successfully trialed rice cultivation, and the local people ate rice they had grown for the first time.
    Rice is a high-yield and stable-yield crop. In normal years, the yield per hectare is around 7,000 to 8,000 jin, which is two to three times higher than the output value of dry land crops. Taking the Mudanjiang area, which grows a large amount of rice, as an example, the area planted 82,600 hectares of rice this year, accounting for 14% of the total area of food crops, with a rice yield of 73,000 tons. The increase in production from paddy fields alone increased the unit area yield of grain per hectare in the entire area by 252 jin. Last year, the rice sown area in Yilan County accounted for 14% of the total area of food crops, but the rice yield accounted for 30% of the total output of food crops, and the farmers' income from rice accounted for more than 40% of the total agricultural income. These are based on the average rice yield of a region. If we look at a cooperative, the rice yield and the income of the members would be even greater. For example, the Hongguang Cooperative and the Ailu Cooperative in Wuchang County, the Hongqi Cooperative in Zhaoyuan County, and the Qin俭 Cooperative in Acheng County all have rice yields of around 10,000 jin per hectare. In particular, the Hongguang Cooperative in Wuchang County, due to continuous bumper harvests of rice, has accumulated more than 90,000 yuan in public funds, sold 63 million jin of grain to the state (last year), and distributed nearly 4 yuan per labor day (which is two to three times higher than the income of ordinary cooperatives). The members of this cooperative have more than enough to eat and wear every year, with one sewing machine for every three families; 80% of the members have savings. All the members of this cooperative have basically reached or exceeded the living standards of well-to-do middle peasants.
    With the rapid expansion of rice acreage, some new difficulties and problems have also emerged. The most important is the contradiction between the labor-intensive and time-consuming nature of rice cultivation and the lack of existing labor and animal power. According to the current cultivated area, the province averages three hectares of land per laborer (equivalent to 45 mu), and the labor force is already feeling insufficient; while rice cultivation requires more meticulous cultivation techniques and stricter operation quality, and the labor spent on one mu of rice is equivalent to two or more mu of dry land crops. This further adds to the difficulty of insufficient labor. To solve this problem, on the one hand, it is necessary to fully utilize the potential of the existing labor force, and on the other hand, it is also necessary to gradually add small agricultural machinery to replace human labor as possible. The Qiezixiang Cooperative in Boli County grows both paddy and dry land (with a small proportion of rice). This spring, most of the male labor force was transferred to reclaim wasteland and plant paddy fields, while at the same time, the crops in the large fields (autumn fields) were urgently in need of hoeing, and the situation was quite tense. This cooperative mobilized women to hoe, and as a result, all corn, millet, sorghum, and other crops were hoeed, achieving a comprehensive bumper harvest of both paddy and dry land. The Wuchang Hongguang Cooperative is a rice cooperative that has always lacked labor, but because it has purchased a large number of agricultural machinery in recent years—prime movers (11 units), water pumps (10 units), rice milling machines (7 units), and seeders, etc.—to replace human labor, the cooperative is relatively well-staffed in all seasons except during the period of cultivating and weeding. These facts fully demonstrate that under the current level of rice development, the problem of insufficient labor can still be solved. However, in the long run, with the development of rice throughout the province, the problem of insufficient labor should be appropriately solved by relying on immigrants from other places, and at the same time, the mechanical cultivation of state-owned farms and tractor stations should also be utilized in a planned manner.
    According to the provisions of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), the planting area of rice in my country, starting from 1956, is required to increase by another 250 million mu within twelve years. Southern China has long been the main rice-producing area, so the large-scale development of paddy fields in the north in the future is of great significance. The situation of rice cultivation in Heilongjiang Province proves that it is possible to develop rice on a large scale in northern China. In terms of the natural conditions of Heilongjiang Province, although the climate here is cold, the annual frost-free period is still 100 to 140 days, while the growth period of rice actually only requires 80 to 100 days. Not only is there very fertile land here (the vast majority is black calcium soil), but there are also incredibly rich water conservancy resources. The total annual runoff of rivers and lakes can reach 93.6 billion cubic meters. If 50% of this water can be controlled and utilized, three million hectares of paddy fields can be developed. Recently, according to the spirit of the National Agricultural Development Program and in combination with the conditions of the province, Heilongjiang Province has formulated a ten-year rice field development plan (draft) for Heilongjiang Province: it is required to develop a total of one million hectares of rice fields within ten years, that is, by 1967, the rice field area in the province will reach 1.25 million hectares. If this plan is realized, it will be possible to increase grain production by four to five million tons in the province. According to the current cultivated area of seven million hectares in Heilongjiang Province, this measure alone can increase the yield per mu by 100 jin on average; at the same time, coupled with other agricultural production increase measures, it is entirely possible to increase the average unit area yield per mu in Heilongjiang Province from the current 192 jin to the 400 jin required by the Forty Articles.

　　我国最北方的水稻
　　本报记者　康伟中
　　黑龙江省的农业生产规划要求，在今后十年内发展稻田一百万公顷，再加上其他增产措施，到1967年，全省每亩平均产量由现在的一百九十二斤提高到“四十条”要求的四百斤，是完全可能的。
    一般人常常认为：水稻仅仅是南方的农作物。实际情况却不是这样。在我国最东北部的黑龙江省，就大量发展着稻田。在这个省份中，南至河流缭绕、山脉纵横的牡丹江地区，北至中苏边疆的黑龙江畔的黑河和呼玛县，西至地势低洼的松花江和嫩江两岸，东至小兴安岭和完达山脉的偏僻山麓，几乎全省每县每乡都种植有稻田。
    据历史记载：在清朝宣统年间，朝鲜族农民崔柱章在黑龙江省南部的宁古塔（即现在的宁安县）开荒试种稻田。从此揭破了东北寒冷地带不能种植水稻的“谜”，农民开始到处收集种子种植稻田。但种植稻田，首先需要引水灌溉。在旧社会，农民没有力量兴修水利，一家一户只能在河沟边湖泊旁，或在涝洼地，种植三亩五亩，就近取水灌溉。这就难怪解放前黑龙江的水稻的发展速度像乌龟爬行那样慢了。1944年是全省水稻发展最高的一年，播种面积也仅仅有十一万公顷。解放后，党和政府了解农民对发展水稻的迫切要求，并采取若干措施，鼓励农民种植水稻。如在兴修水利、农业税率（垦荒三年不纳税、水田和旱田同一个税率）等方面给予了优待。1956年全省农业高级合作化之后，水稻的发展急剧地直线上升；这一年全省发展了十二万四千公顷（连原有稻田，总数达到二十九万公顷），超过了解放前四十年水稻发展的总和。
    水稻的发展有赖于兴修水利。这一年，兴修塘坝有一千零二十一处，主要灌溉干渠有二百多条，并在宁安、甘南、穆棱、尚志、通河等县兴建了五座水库。兴建的五百多处机械抽水灌溉站，也配备了七百台抽水机进行灌溉。1957年的水利建设，又有了新的发展。大举兴修水利的结果，使水稻作物遍及了全省。过去一向没有种植水稻习惯的兰西、望奎、肇州、肇源等县开始种植水稻；就是位于北纬五十三度的中苏边疆的孙吴、逊克等地，也试种稻田成功，当地人民第一次吃到了自己栽培的稻米。
    水稻是高产和稳产作物。一般年景，每公顷水稻产量都在七、八千斤左右，比旱田作物产值高出二、三倍。以种植水稻较多的牡丹江专区为例，全区今年种植水稻八万二千六百公顷地，占粮食作物总面积的14％，稻子产量达到七万三千吨。仅因水田的增产，就使全区每公顷的粮食单位面积产量增加了二百五十二斤。依兰县去年水稻播种面积占粮食作物总面积的14％，但水稻的产量却占整个粮食作物产量的30％，而农民对水稻的收入占农业总收入的40％以上。这都是以一个地区水稻平均产量情况来看的，如果以一个合作社来看，那水稻的产量和社员的收入就更多了。如五常县的红光合作社、爱路合作社，肇源县的红旗合作社，阿城县的勤俭合作社，它们种植的水稻，每公顷产量都在万斤左右。特别是五常县的红光合作社，由于水稻连年获得丰收，积累了九万多元的公积金，向国家卖出了六千三百万斤粮食（去年），每个劳动日分得了近四元的收入（这比一般合作社收入高出二、三倍）。这个合作社的社员每年吃穿都有余，每三家有一台缝纫机；80％的社员都有存款。这个合作社的全部社员，基本上达到或超过了富裕中农的生活水平。
    随着水稻面积的迅速扩大，也出现了一些新的困难和问题。最主要的是水稻耕作费工费时和现有劳畜力缺乏之间的矛盾。按现有耕作面积，全省平均每个劳力负担三公顷地（合四十五市亩），劳动力已感不足；而种植水稻要求耕作技术更加细致，作业质量更加严格，一亩水稻花费的劳力相当于两亩或更多的旱田作物。这更增添了劳动力不足的困难，为了解决这个问题，一方面需要充分发挥现有劳动力的潜力，另一方面也需要根据可能，逐步增添小型农业机械，代替人力。勃利县茄子乡合作社，是水旱田兼种（水稻比重小），今春绝大部分男劳动力抽调出来开荒种水田，而当时大田（秋田）作物又急于铲趟，情况相当紧张。这个社就深入发动妇女铲趟，结果全部包米、谷子、高粱等作物都铲趟，作到了水旱田全面丰收。五常红光合作社，是个水稻合作社，一向劳动力不足，但由于几年来置备了大批农业机械——原动机（十一台）、水泵（十台）、制米机（七台）和点播机等，代替了人力，结果这个社除中耕除草期间劳动力稍感紧张外，其余季节劳力都比较充足。这些事实，充分说明了在目前水稻发展水平的情况下，劳动力不足的问题还是可以设法解决的。但从长远看，随着全省水稻的发展，劳动力不足问题，还是要适当依靠外地移民来解决，同时也要有计划地利用国营农场和拖拉机站的机械代耕。
    根据全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的规定，我国水稻的种植面积，从1956年起，在十二年内，要求再增加二亿五千万亩。我国南方早已是主要水稻产区，因此，将来大量发展北方的稻田，具有重大意义。黑龙江省种植水稻的情况证明，在我国北方是可以大量发展水稻的。就黑龙江省的自然条件来说，尽管这里气候寒冷，但每年的无霜期仍有一百天到一百四十天，而水稻的成长期实际只需要八十天到一百天。这里不仅有非常肥沃的土地（绝大多数是黑钙土），而且还有丰富无比的水利资源。河流和湖泊年总径流量可达到九百三十六亿公方。这些水量如果能控制利用50％，就可以发展稻田三百万公顷。最近，黑龙江省根据全国农业发展纲要的精神，结合本省的条件，已经制定出黑龙江省今后十年稻田发展规划（草案）：要求在十年内共发展稻田一百万公顷，即到1967年全省稻田面积达到一百二十五万公顷。如果实现了这个计划，就有可能在全省内增产粮食四、五百万吨，按黑龙江省现有耕地面积七百万公顷计算，光这一项措施，平均每亩即可提高产量一百斤；同时再加上其他农业增产措施，黑龙江省每亩平均单位面积产量由现在的一百九十二斤提高到四十条所要求的四百斤，是完全可能的。
