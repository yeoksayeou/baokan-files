    Seriously Treat the Criticisms of the Masses
　　Ji Xichen
    "The masses say what they think, and the government corrects its shortcomings. This is true socialist democracy!" This is the consistent comment of the farmers in Zhao Du Township, Jintang County, on the rectification work.

    During the airing of views in this township, many suggestions and criticisms were made regarding the work of various Party and government departments. The Jintang County Party Committee, in conjunction with the rectification campaign, not only seriously and humbly studied these opinions and immediately improved what could be improved, but also, the heads of various departments, in coordination with the rectification work of the grassroots organizations, personally went to all the people's representatives of Zhao Du Township to review, explain, and clarify the various opinions raised by the masses, item by item. After the meeting, it was widely conveyed and discussed in various villages. This spirit of seriously treating the criticisms of the masses and resolutely improving the work has won the enthusiastic support and praise of the people throughout the township.

    Going to the places where the masses have opinions to answer them is a good way to promote the in-depth development of rectification work. What are its advantages? First, the responsible persons personally go to the grassroots level to directly review, answer, and explain the problems to the masses, which not only strengthens the connection between the leadership and the masses, but also puts the rectification work directly under the supervision of the masses, truly turning the criticisms and suggestions of the masses into the driving force of the rectification work. Second, it enhances the masses' sense of ownership. Humbly reviewing, carefully investigating, and realistically analyzing all opinions of the masses, large and small, and truly achieving "each item has an explanation, and each matter has a resolution," is in itself a profound education on democratic centralism for the masses. Third, the masses see that the leadership "admits mistakes and corrects them" and takes the lead in self-criticism, which boosts morale and strengthens confidence, thereby continuing to put forward many new criticisms and suggestions, so that the grassroots rectification work progresses along a healthy path from the very beginning.

    严肃对待群众的批评
　　纪希晨
    “群众有啥意见说啥，政府有啥缺点改啥，这才真是社会主义的民主嘛！”这是金堂县赵渡乡农民对整改工作的一致评论。
    这个乡在鸣放中，对于党政各部门工作提了许多建议和批评。金堂县委机关结合整风，不仅认真虚心的研究了这些意见，能改进的立即加以改进，而且，各部门负责人还配合基层组织的整改工作，亲自出面向赵渡乡全体人民代表，对于群众提出的各种意见，逐条逐件的加以检讨、交代和说明，会后，各村还普遍作了传达和讨论。这种严肃对待群众批评，坚决改进工作的精神，博得了全乡人民的热烈拥护和赞誉。
    那里群众有意见，就到那里去解答，是推动整改工作深入发展的好方法。它有那些好处呢？一、负责人亲自出面到达基层，直接向群众检讨解答说明问题，不仅密切了领导和群众的联系，而且还可使整改工作，直接置于群众的监督之下，把群众的批评建议，真正变成整改工作的动力。二、提高了群众主人翁的感觉。对群众大小意见都虚心检讨，认真调查，并加以实事求是的分析，真正做到“件件有交代，事事有着落”，这件事本身就是对群众的一次深刻的民主集中制的教育。三、群众看到领导上“知错就改”，带头检讨，鼓舞了情绪，增强了信心，从而继续提出了许多新的批评和建议，使基层整改工作一开始就沿着健康的道路前进。
