　　Encourage Less Travel Home
　　Regarding the issues of visiting relatives' leave and travel expense subsidies, I think it can be modified as follows: For those who visit relatives once a year, subsidize one-fifth of the round-trip travel expenses; for those who visit relatives once every two years, subsidize two-fifths; for those who visit relatives once every three years, subsidize three-fifths; for those who visit relatives once every four years, subsidize four-fifths; for those who visit relatives once every five years, all travel expenses will be borne by the administrative side. Regarding the granting of leave time, regardless of the distance and length of service, it can be calculated as two weeks, and the round-trip travel time will not be included in the leave.
　　Doing so can encourage employees to travel home less, which is beneficial to production.

　　Avoid Personnel Flow
　　I support the draft provisional regulations on employees returning home to visit relatives. However, the issue of employees returning home to visit relatives should also be fundamentally resolved. One solution is to try to avoid personnel flow and make every effort to obtain materials locally. In the past few years, many employees from the Kailuan Coal Mine were transferred to the Northeast and Central China to support construction there. However, many similar employees were transferred to Kailuan from other regions, truly a massive movement across the country. For the needs of national construction, the transfer of employees is necessary and must be obeyed. However, if the labor organization department uses its brains more and reduces unnecessary transfers or shortens the transfer distance without affecting construction, it will be very beneficial to the country and the employees themselves.

　　Save on Visiting Relatives' Travel Subsidies
　　The State Council has issued the provisional regulations (draft) on the holidays and wage treatment for workers and staff returning home to visit relatives, which fully demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system. In order to make this regulation more complete and to encourage the vast number of employees to work in the remote border areas of the motherland far from their hometowns, I would like to offer some suggestions for revising Article 5 of the regulations.
　　Article 5 stipulates that when the round-trip transportation expenses for returning home to visit relatives exceed one-half of the employee's monthly hourly wage standard, the administrative side will subsidize one-half of the excess. According to this calculation, the farther away from the hometown and the more inconvenient the transportation in the area, the more travel expenses the individual pays, and the more subsidies the state provides. This still does not solve the problem for employees in areas far from their hometowns with inconvenient transportation.
　　How can we make the subsidy more reasonable and in line with the spirit of thrift? My opinion is: If the transportation expenses account for less than 60% of the employee's monthly salary, no subsidy will be given; if it exceeds 60%, most or all of the excess will be subsidized by the state. The state can save a sum of money to increase the subsidy ratio for employees with higher transportation expenses. This will not have a big impact on employees who are closer to their hometowns and will stimulate employees to leave their hometowns and participate in socialist construction in remote areas.

　　Visit Relatives After Two Years of Work
　　After reading the "State Council's Provisional Regulations (Draft) on the Holidays and Wage Treatment for Workers and Staff Returning Home to Visit Relatives," I deeply appreciate the meticulous care that the Party and the government provide for the lives of employees. It is truly a blessing to be a working person today! However, there are some places in the regulations that are worth studying and improving. For example, Article 2 of the draft says that employees who have worked for one year can enjoy the treatment for returning home to visit relatives. I think this needs to be revised. Because newly employed workers have not been away from home for long, it is better for them not to go back for the time being from the perspective of doing a good job. There are fifty-eight holidays in a year, and after deducting the three weeks for visiting relatives, there are only nine months of actual working time. Such a short period of time is probably not enough for them to become familiar with their work. Therefore, I suggest that newly employed workers should not start to enjoy the treatment for returning home to visit relatives until after two years.

　　大家来讨论国务院公布的四项规定草案
    鼓励少回家
    关于探亲假期和路费补助问题，我认为可以这样修改：一年探亲一次的，补助往返路费的五分之一；二年探亲一次的，补助五分之二；三年探亲一次的，补助五分之三；四年探亲一次的，补助五分之四；五年探亲一次的，路费全部由行政方面负担。关于给假时间，可以不分路途远近和年限，均以两个星期计算，其往返旅程不计算在假期内。
    这样做，可以鼓励职工少回家，有利于生产。

    避免人员对流
    我拥护关于职工回家探亲的暂行规定草案。但还应从根本上来解决职工回家探亲的问题。解决办法之一是：设法避免人员对流，竭力就地取材。前几年，开滦煤矿好些职工调到东北、华中等地区去支援那儿的建设，但是，又有不少同类职工从别的地区调到开滦来，真是天南地北大变动。为了国家建设的需要，职工的调动是必要的，必须服从的。然而，如果劳动组织部门多用点脑筋，在不影响建设的前提下，少作无谓的调动，或者缩短调动距离，对国家、对职工本人都很有好处。

    节约探亲路费补贴
    国务院颁发了关于工人、职员回家探亲的假期和工资待遇的暂行规定（草案），充分说明了社会主义制度的优越性。为了使这个规定更加完善，并使这个规定能鼓励广大职工在远离家乡的祖国边远地区工作，对规定的第五条提出一些修改意见。
    第五条规定，回家探亲往返车船费超过本人月计时工资标准二分之一的时候，由行政方面补助超过部分的二分之一。按这样计算，就是离家乡愈远，在交通愈不方便的地区，本人支出的旅费愈多，国家补助也愈多。这对在远离家乡、交通不便地区的职工还是不能解决问题。
    怎么样使补助更加合理，又符合节约的精神？我的意见是：车船费占本人月工资60％以内，可不给予补助，超出60％的，超出部分大部分或全部由国家补助，国家可节约一笔钱，用来增加车船费支出较多职工的补助比例。这对离乡较近的职工影响不大，又能刺激职工远离家乡到边远的地区参加社会主义建设。

    参加两年工作  再回家探亲
    读了“国务院关于工人、职员回家探亲的假期和工资待遇的暂行规定（草案）”以后，深深体会到党和政府对职工生活的照顾是无微不至的，在今天作一个劳动人民真是幸福！但，规定中有些地方，有值得研究、改进的。比如：草案第二条说，参加工作一年的职工就可以享受关于回家探亲的待遇，我认为需要修改。因为新参加工作的职工离家还不久，从搞好工作看，还是暂时不回去的好。一年当中，有假节日五十八天，再除去回家省亲的三个星期，只有九个月的实际工作时间了。时间这么短，恐怕他们的业务都还不熟悉呢。因此，我建议新参加工作的职工，要两年以后才开始享受回家探亲的待遇。
