Xinhua News Agency, Zhoushan, 24th -- The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in the Zhoushan area, including naval and land forces, bravely rescued fishermen who were hit by a powerful storm, safely rescuing over nine hundred fishermen who had fallen into the water and over three hundred fishermen who were drifting with the wind on damaged wooden boats.

On the afternoon of December 12th, due to the strengthening of a low-pressure system over the Yellow Sea, more than 60,000 fishermen working in the Zhoushan fishing grounds were suddenly hit by a force 8-9 gale, with winds sometimes reaching force 12. The lives of the fishermen at sea and the safety of their boats were seriously threatened. At this time, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in the Zhoushan area immediately mobilized urgently, assisting local Party and government organs in fully engaging in rescue work. More than ten naval vessels immediately weighed anchor and left port as soon as the typhoon entered the Zhoushan fishing grounds, braving the raging winds and waves to go to the scene for rescue. During the rescue, officers and soldiers disregarded their own lives, bravely rescued more than 1,200 fishermen who had fallen into the water or were in danger, and took off their own clothes to give to the fishermen who had fallen into the water. The army units stationed in the Zhoushan area dispatched medical teams to the fishing grounds on the same day to treat the injured fishermen. The officers also enthusiastically donated more than 4,300 yuan in cash to help the affected fishermen. The Shengshan garrison troops also vacated houses for the affected fishermen to live in. The army and navy units stationed in Zhoushan and Shanghai also sent more than 1,000 cotton-padded clothes, more than 100 cotton quilts, 300 catties of bread, and many life jackets and lifebuoys to the affected fishermen.

In order to commend and thank the heroic acts of the People's Liberation Army Zhoushan land and naval forces in bravely rescuing the fishermen affected by the disaster, the Zhejiang Provincial Party and government organs sent a delegation on the 22nd to express their condolences to the naval vessel units. The Zhoushan Fishing Ground Command also presented banners to the naval vessel units participating in the rescue and relief operations on behalf of more than 60,000 fishermen from Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces.

With the help and care of the Party and government organs and the stationed troops, the fishermen in the Zhoushan fishing grounds avoided serious losses in the storm, overcame the powerful disaster, and have quickly organized themselves to regroup and put themselves into production. They are preparing to produce 1.7 million dan of fish to make up for the losses caused by the disaster.

    人民子弟兵一切为人民
    舟山驻军冒大风暴抢救渔民
    一千二百多渔民脱险并得到亲切关怀
    新华社舟山24日电　中国人民解放军驻舟山地区的海、陆军部队奋勇抢救遭受强大风暴袭击的渔民，使九百多落水渔民和三百多乘着被风暴打坏的木船随风漂流的渔民安全脱离了险境。
    本月12日下午，由于黄海上空低气压的加强，正在舟山渔场生产的六万多渔民突然遭到八至九级大风的袭击，而且有时风力强达十二级。海上渔民的生命和船只的安全受到严重的威胁。这时，驻舟山地区的人民解放军部队立即紧急动员起来，协助当地党政机关全力投入抢救工作。海军的十多艘舰艇在台风一侵入舟山渔场的时候，就立即起锚离港，冒着狂风巨浪，开赴现场进行抢救。在抢救中，官兵们不顾生命危险，奋勇救起了一千二百多名落水和陷入险境的渔民，并且脱下自己的衣服给落水的渔民穿。驻舟山地区的陆军部队当天就派出了医疗队，前往渔场为受伤渔民治疗。军官们还热情地捐出现金四千三百多元，救济受灾渔民。嵊山守备部队也腾出房子让受灾渔民居住。驻舟山和上海的陆、海军部队，还给受灾的渔民送来一千多件棉衣、一百多条棉被、三百斤面包和许多救生衣、救生袋等物资。
    为了表彰和感谢人民解放军驻舟山陆、海军部队奋勇抢救遭灾渔民的英勇行为，浙江省党政机关22日派出了慰问团，到海军舰艇部队进行慰问。舟山渔场指挥部也代表来自江苏、山东、浙江、福建四省的六万多渔民，赠送锦旗给参加抢险救生的海军舰艇部队。
    舟山渔场的渔民们在党政机关和驻军的帮助和关怀下，在风暴中避免了严重的损失，战胜了强大风灾之后，已经迅速组织起来，重整旗鼓投入生产。他们准备生产一百七十万担鱼，来弥补受灾损失。
