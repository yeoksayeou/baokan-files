Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Deng Zihui, Director of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a concluding report at the symposium on animal husbandry production in pastoral areas.

In his concluding report, Deng Zihui first discussed China's achievements in developing animal husbandry. He said that China's animal husbandry has made great progress in recent years, and the achievements are tremendous. This year, the number of large livestock such as cattle, horses, mules, and donkeys has reached 84.27 million head nationwide, an increase of 40% compared with 1949, 10.6% compared with 1952, and more than 12.7 million head compared with 1935, the year with the highest number before liberation. The number of sheep and goats has reached 97.69 million, an increase of 130% compared with 1949, 58% compared with 1952, and more than 35.1 million compared with 1937, the year with the highest number before liberation. The development of pigs has also exceeded the highest level before liberation and the levels of 1949 and 1952, reaching more than 125 million head this year.

Deng Zihui said that the development of animal husbandry has played a significant role in the development of the entire national economy. First, it provides power for agricultural production. At present, there are 52.51 million draught animals nationwide, and more than 98% of farmland relies on animal power for plowing. Inner Mongolia and various pastoral areas supply a large number of draught animals every year to support agricultural production. Second, it provides the main source of fertilizer for agricultural production. Third, it provides power for the transportation industry. According to statistics, there are 737,000 draught animals nationwide specifically used for transportation, and even more are used for transportation as a secondary purpose. Animal power accounts for a large proportion of freight volume in both plains and mountainous areas. Fourth, it provides a large amount of raw materials such as wool and hides for light industry and handicrafts. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 84.12 million sheepskins and 267,000 tons of wool have been provided in the past eight years. Fifth, it provides meat, milk, dairy products, and other foods for urban and rural residents. Sixth, it has accumulated funds and foreign exchange for the country. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the state collected 1.82 billion yuan in slaughter tax and livestock transaction tax. During this period, if the livestock products exported by the state were all exchanged for steel, they could be exchanged for 2.79 million tons. Seventh, it increased the income of people in pastoral areas and improved their lives. According to statistics, in the first four years of the first Five-Year Plan period, the average annual income from animal husbandry in the national income reached 6.24 billion yuan, accounting for 11.5% of the total value of agricultural and sideline production.

Deng Zihui said that another achievement of animal husbandry work is that a number of socialist and semi-socialist animal husbandry production cooperatives and joint state-private ranches have been established in some pastoral areas on the basis of basically completing democratic reforms. In agricultural areas, animal husbandry has basically achieved collective ownership along with agriculture. Pastoral areas in Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Gansu, and other places have established 1,763 animal husbandry production cooperatives, 92 joint state-private ranches, and 9,469 mutual aid teams. These mutual aid and cooperative organizations and joint state-private economic units have generally demonstrated their superiority in production and have accumulated a set of experiences in running animal husbandry cooperatives and joint state-private ranches, creating conditions for actively and steadily realizing the socialist transformation of pastoral areas.

State-owned ranches under ownership by the whole people have also developed. There are now 639 state-owned ranches nationwide, 129 of which are located in the four major pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Qinghai. These ranches have become a strong base for the development of animal husbandry in pastoral areas, playing a demonstrative role in the promotion of fine breeds of livestock and the management of collective animal husbandry.

He said that preliminary achievements have also been made in basic construction in animal husbandry. In recent years, the number of animal husbandry work stations has increased to 3,700, and the number of high- and middle-level animal husbandry and veterinary cadres has increased to more than 16,000. Rinderpest has been basically eliminated, and diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease have also been controlled. Some progress has been made in livestock breed improvement, and nearly 4 million head of improved hybrid horses and sheep have been bred nationwide.

Deng Zihui pointed out that these achievements are mainly due to the correctness of the central government's guidelines and policies, the attention paid to animal husbandry work by the pastoral area party committees, the efforts of animal husbandry work cadres, and the mobilization of the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses. The assistance of Soviet experts and the research and creation of Chinese scientific workers have also played a great role. The state has given great support to animal husbandry, investing 150 million yuan and issuing a large number of loans, purchasing a large number of livestock and livestock products, and supporting animal husbandry production.

Deng Zihui also spoke about the existing problems in China's animal husbandry production. He said that although China's animal husbandry has made great progress, the number of various livestock has not reached the targets of the first Five-Year Plan. Only sheep are close to completing the plan, reaching 98.1% of the planned number.

He pointed out that the net increase rate of large livestock has decreased in the past two or three years. The number of large livestock in 1957 was even less than in 1956. In particular, the number of donkeys has been declining since 1955, decreasing by 1.8 million head in 1957 compared with 1954, and 1.245 million head less than the highest year before liberation. In 1957, the number of horses increased by 140,000 head compared with 1956, and the number of water buffalo increased by 150,000 head; however, the number of yellow cattle decreased by 1.12 million head, mules decreased by 4,000, and donkeys decreased by 430,000. Offsetting the increases and decreases, the number of large livestock in 1957 decreased by 1.3 million head compared with 1956.

As a result of the decline in the net increase rate of livestock and the reduction in existing livestock, the burden on draught animals in agricultural areas has increased. In Hebei Province, each draught animal supported an average of 37.6 mu of cultivated land in 1952, which increased to 41.9 mu in 1957. In Jilin Province, the area of cultivated land supported by each draught animal in 1957 also increased by 41% compared with 1954. A serious situation among the existing draught animals is that there are many old and disabled animals, many strong animals, and few young animals. According to statistics in Hebei Province, young animals account for only 6% of the total number of large livestock, old and disabled animals account for 31%, and strong animals account for 63%. There are too few young animals, and when the strong animals become old and disabled, the number of draught animals to replace them will decrease, seriously affecting agricultural production.

Deng Zihui pointed out that the reasons why animal husbandry production is not stable enough are, from the perspective of pastoral areas, first, natural disasters. Severe droughts in spring and summer and heavy wind and snow in winter affect the development of animal husbandry. Second, only natural water sources and grasslands are used, and basic construction in water and grass has not been carried out on a large scale. Due to the limitations of water and grass, when the number of livestock in an area reaches a certain level, it cannot continue to develop, or even declines. Basic construction such as fences and sheds has not kept up, and they cannot resist wind and snow. Third, the work of exchanging and adjusting livestock has not been done well enough. Livestock in pastoral areas cannot be sold, and some are left to fend for themselves, while agricultural areas feel a shortage of draught animals. Although the price policy is basically reasonable when adjusting livestock, there are still unreasonable aspects in the price differences between purchasing and sales, regions, and breeds, which cannot play a role in encouraging production. Fourth, technical support for pastoral areas is not enough, and epidemic prevention work and the supply of fine breeding bulls have not fully kept up. Fifth, livestock product processing industries are too far from pastoral areas, and it is difficult to transport livestock products used as raw materials outward, which affects production. Sixth, and most importantly, the socialist transformation of animal husbandry in pastoral areas has not been completed, and the fragility of animal husbandry production still exists. In this way, the cyclical decline of livestock in pastoral areas every ten to twelve years still plays a significant role.

From the perspective of agricultural areas, the reasons for the shortage of draught animals and the excessive number of young animals are, first, insufficient attention. In the past few years, there has been a certain degree of emphasis on agriculture and disregard for animal husbandry from top to bottom in agricultural areas. There is insufficient understanding of the interdependent relationship between agriculture and animal husbandry. Some areas have overestimated mechanization too early and have not fully recognized that livestock is the main driving force for our agricultural production for a considerable period of time, so they have relaxed animal husbandry work. Second, in the process of realizing agricultural cooperativization, we did not foresee enough that the rules that originally governed the small-scale peasant economy would change and lose their effect, and we failed to summarize in a timely manner a set of effective methods to protect and breed draught animals adapted to the new situation of the collective economy. Third, in many areas, the valuation of draught animals entering the cooperative was too low, only strong animals were wanted and not young animals, or members were not allowed to raise large livestock, which also had a negative impact. Fourth, agricultural cooperatives have not done a good job in the feeding and management of livestock. In the beginning, some places concentrated feeding excessively, which did not work well. Later, the implementation of feeding by teams, households, and yokes played a great role. Of course, there is no need to change the original feeding methods if they are relatively reasonable, but in some places, some cooperatives should implement decentralized feeding, but the cadres' thinking is not clear, and they have not implemented it well. Fifth, the contradiction between the use of draught animals and the protection of pregnant and lactating animals in agricultural cooperatives has not been well resolved, and no specific system and reward methods have been formulated for breeding young animals in terms of feeding management and breeding and pregnancy protection. Sixth, the work of adjusting livestock has not been done well enough. The old system of livestock transportation and sales has been broken, and the new system has not been fully established. Various places have been in a state of prohibition of transportation for a long time, and the work of adjusting and transporting livestock has stagnated; in some places, the prohibition of slaughter is too strict, and old and disabled livestock that should be slaughtered cannot be slaughtered, which affects the increase of livestock. In addition, the problem of insufficient feed in some areas has not been resolved, which is also an important reason for the decline in livestock.

Next, Comrade Deng Zihui talked about the future direction and tasks of animal husbandry development.

He said that the areas in China that engage in animal husbandry can be roughly divided into three types. One type is the northern grassland pastoral area, one type is the southern mountainous pastoral area, and the other type is the general agricultural area.

The grassland pastoral area mainly includes Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Gansu, Xinjiang, northwestern Sichuan, and other regions. The characteristics of these regions are: more than 90% are inhabited by ethnic minorities, who have engaged in animal husbandry for generations and have rich experience, which is an advantage, but the people's cultural level is low, and there are some bad customs and habits that affect the development of animal husbandry; the progress of democratic reform and socialist transformation varies in different pastoral areas. Under the current relations of production and technology, animal husbandry production still has fragility and instability; although the commodity nature of animal husbandry production is very large, the inconvenient transportation and sparse population have an impact on the development of animal husbandry. Therefore, the guiding principle for developing animal husbandry production in grassland pastoral areas is: to actively develop animal husbandry on the basis of actively and steadily carrying out socialist transformation, gradually change nomadic grazing to settled grazing, implement a combination of agriculture and animal husbandry (first of all, feed production), engage in sideline production such as livestock product processing, and develop a diversified economy centered on animal husbandry.

Mountainous pastoral areas include provinces south of the Yangtze River and in the Yangtze River basin. The guiding principle for developing animal husbandry production in these areas is: on the basis of striving for self-sufficiency in grain and oil, and under the principle of not destroying soil and water conservation, actively develop animal husbandry and develop a diversified economy combining agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations.

Deng Zihui pointed out that regardless of grassland pastoral areas or mountainous pastoral areas, their tasks are: not only to develop livestock, but also to transfer livestock out; not only to supply meat and livestock products, but also to provide draught animals and working animals to places in agricultural areas with insufficient animal power.

The task of developing animal husbandry in general agricultural areas is: to gradually achieve self-sufficiency or partial self-sufficiency in the required livestock.

After discussing the issue of socialist transformation in pastoral areas, Deng Zihui talked about the issue of production and construction in pastoral areas. He said that gradually increasing the net increase rate of livestock is the basic key to expanded reproduction in pastoral areas. The net increase rate of livestock should reach 8%-10% per year. In order to ensure that this net increase rate is achieved, we should increase the livestock reproduction rate, improve the survival rate, and achieve guaranteed mating, guaranteed pregnancy, guaranteed birth, and guaranteed survival; the livestock transferred out should account for a certain proportion; the consumption rate of livestock should also be controlled to a certain extent, and the most fundamental thing is to reduce disaster deaths.

He pointed out that an important link in increasing the net increase rate of livestock is to strengthen the basic construction work of animal husbandry. First of all, we must carry out water conservancy construction in pastoral areas. With water, there will be grass, and with sufficient water and grass, animal husbandry can develop. Second, we must do a good job in grassland protection, cultivation, improvement, and management. On the basis of cooperativization, we must appropriately adjust the scope and rights of grassland use, and implement rotational grazing in a planned way to facilitate the growth of pasture. Third, we must gradually promote settled grazing, combine agriculture and animal husbandry, and plant feed and grain crops for the consumption of herdsmen. Fourth, in order to improve the net increase rate, we must promote grazing in separate groups, improve the composition of livestock herds, increase the proportion of breeding females of the right age, and breed on schedule. We must also build sheds and pens, store grass and prepare materials, and eliminate animal pests to reduce losses. We must advocate thrift among herdsmen and reduce the consumption of livestock. In addition, we must improve livestock breeds, strengthen epidemic prevention work, train animal husbandry and veterinary cadres, and enhance technical guidance.

Regarding the issue of developing animal husbandry in agricultural areas, Deng Zihui said that first of all, we must loudly appeal to all localities to recognize the interdependent relationship between agriculture and animal husbandry. If the current phenomenon of reduced draught animals and disregard for young animals is not changed, it will be a great threat to agricultural production. In order to gradually achieve self-sufficiency or the majority of self-sufficiency in the required livestock in agricultural areas, while vigorously developing agricultural production, we must also vigorously develop animal husbandry. Not only should agricultural cooperatives raise livestock, but every member's family can raise a certain number of livestock. Large livestock should be mainly raised by the cooperative, but members should be allowed to raise them privately; small livestock should be mainly raised privately, as long as members do not hinder collective production, and should not be blindly restricted. All agricultural cooperatives should strive to raise breeding bulls themselves, protect females, guarantee mating, guarantee pregnancy, guarantee birth, guarantee survival, gradually breed, rely on their own efforts, and gradually solve the problem of insufficient animal power. In order to protect the existing draught animals, agricultural cooperatives should improve the feeding management and use system, and should vigorously promote the system of feeding, using, and combining teams, households, and yokes. This is the best system. Wherever there are still serious problems in the feeding management of draught animals and a reasonable solution has not been found, it should be discussed with members and this method or other reasonable improvement methods should be adopted. In addition, agricultural cooperatives should also establish various reward systems to promote livestock raising and livestock loving work.

Deng Zihui said that an important way for agricultural areas to achieve livestock self-sufficiency should be for each province to establish livestock bases in mountainous areas at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels, and vigorously breed them in order to meet the needs of agricultural areas within the province, prefecture, and county. In addition, agricultural areas that cannot be fully self-sufficient or that urgently need to supplement draught animals should be vigorously supplied by pastoral areas; state-owned farms have a number of strong livestock and should be sold at appropriately reduced prices to support agricultural production in the vicinity.

Solving the difficulty of insufficient grass and feed is an urgent problem to be solved in the development of animal husbandry in agricultural areas, and he also gave instructions in this regard. Deng Zihui focused on praising Jilin Province's method of reserving a certain feed base according to draught animals, saying that this is the most fundamental measure to ensure the supply of draught animal feed and ensure the health and breeding of draught animals, and it should be vigorously promoted in various places.

Regarding economic work related to animal husbandry, Deng Zihui also gave detailed instructions. He said that the management of draught animals, working animals, young animals, and meat animals should be unified. The city service department and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives have reached an agreement and should convene a meeting of relevant personnel immediately to discuss unified management methods and procedures, and establish purchasing, sales, transportation agencies, and grass and feed stations, mule and horse shops, etc., with reference to the historical flow direction of draught animals, in order to adjust livestock as soon as possible. In the livestock purchasing work, we must implement the principle of subordinating to production, the purchasing specifications must be adapted to local conditions, and must also refer to historical habits so that they can adapt to the normal elimination rules of livestock; purchasing departments must also go deep into areas with inconvenient transportation and more livestock to purchase, and avoid concentrating purchasing work in areas along transportation lines; purchasing in pastoral areas must have a certain proportion to maintain the net increase rate in production areas. Purchasing prices must also be reasonable, and a minimum protection price must be stipulated to ensure that livestock farmers benefit, and the phenomenon of suppressing grades and prices must be overcome.

He said that in order to promote the development of animal husbandry, livestock product processing enterprises should be transferred to pastoral areas, and the transportation industry in grassland and mountainous pastoral areas should also be gradually developed.

Deng Zihui concluded by saying that "strengthening leadership and comprehensive planning" is the key to developing animal husbandry. To this end, each locality must have the secretary in charge, strengthen the Party committee's leadership over animal husbandry, and have a special agency to manage this work. It is also necessary to formulate plans for the development of animal husbandry for five years, ten years, and the current year. This plan should not only include the number of large and small livestock to be developed, but also the quantity of livestock and livestock products to be supplied.

He said that the primary task this winter and next spring is to protect livestock so that they can safely pass the winter. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient draught animals in some agricultural areas, a certain number of draught animals should be transferred from Inner Mongolia and pastoral areas in southern provinces before the spring plowing next year to supply them. Relevant departments should treat the work of adjusting draught animals as an important political task and ensure its completion.

    加强领导　全面规划　发展畜牧业
    邓子恢在畜牧业生产座谈会上谈今后发展畜牧业的方针
    北方草原牧区：应在积极而又稳步进行社会主义改造的基础上发展畜牧业，逐步改游牧为定居放牧，实行农牧业结合，兼营畜产品加工业等副业生产，发展以牧业为中心的多种经济；
    山地牧区：应在争取粮食自给的基础上，在不破坏水土保持的原则下，积极发展畜牧业，发展农林牧副业相结合的多种经济；
    一般农业区：要逐步做到所需牲畜自养自给或部分自给。
    新华社19日讯　中共中央农村工作部部长、国务院副总理邓子恢在牧区畜牧业生产座谈会上作了总结报告。
    邓子恢在总结报告中首先谈到了我国发展畜牧业的成绩。他说，我国的畜牧业几年来有了很大发展，成绩是巨大的。今年全国牛、马、骡、驴等大牲畜已经发展到八千四百二十七万头，比1949年增加40％，比1952年增加10.6％，比解放前数量最高的1935年增加一千二百七十多万头；绵羊、山羊已经发展到九千七百六十九万只，比1949年增加130％，比1952年增加58％，比解放前数量最高的1937年增加三千五百一十多万只。猪的发展也超过了解放前的最高水平和1949、1952年的水平，今年已有一亿二千五百多万头。
    邓子恢说，畜牧业的发展对整个国民经济的发展起了重大作用。首先，为农业生产提供了动力。目前，全国耕畜达五千二百五十一万头，98％以上的农田都靠畜力翻耕。内蒙古和各牧业区每年都供应很多耕畜来支援农业生产。第二，为农业生产提供了主要肥源。第三，为运输业提供了动力。据统计，全国专供交通运输用的役畜达七十三万七千头，兼作运输用的更多，无论平原、山区，畜力运输载货量所占的比重都很大。第四，为轻工业、手工业提供了大量的毛、皮等原料。据不完全统计，八年来共提供羊皮八千四百一十二万张，羊毛二十六万七千吨。第五，为城乡人民提供了肉食和奶、奶制品等食品。第六，给国家积累了资金和外汇。在第一个五年计划期间，国家征收的屠宰税和牲畜交易税即达十八亿二千万元。在此期间，国家出口的畜产品如果都换钢材，可换二百七十九万吨。第七，增加了牧区人民收入，改善了生活。据统计，在第一个五年计划期间的前四年，在国民收入中畜牧业收入平均每年达六十二点四亿元，占农副业总产值的11.5％。
    邓子恢说，畜牧业工作的另一成绩，是部分牧业区在基本完成民主改革的基础上建立了一批社会主义和半社会主义的畜牧业生产合作社和公私合营牧场。在农业区的畜牧业已经和农业一起基本上实现了集体所有制。内蒙古、青海、新疆、甘肃等地的牧业区已经建立牧业生产合作社一千七百六十三个，公私合营牧场九十二个，互助组九千四百六十九个，这些互助合作组织和公私合营经济单位，一般的在生产上都显示了优越性，并且积累了一套举办牧业合作社和公私合营牧场的经验，为积极而又稳步地实现牧业区的社会主义改造创造了条件。
    全民所有制的国营牧场也有了发展。现在全国共有国营牧场六百三十九个，其中有一百二十九个在内蒙古、甘肃、新疆和青海等四大牧区。这些牧场已经成为牧区发展畜牧业的有力基地，对优良种畜的推广和集体畜牧业的经营管理等工作，起了示范作用。
    他说，在牧业基本建设上也取得了初步成就。几年来畜牧工作站已经发展到三千七百处，高、中级的畜牧兽医工作干部增加到一万六千多人。牛瘟已经基本消灭，口蹄疫等病害也得到了控制。畜种改良工作有了一定的成绩，全国改良杂交的马、羊已近四百万头。
    邓子恢指出，这些成绩的获得，主要是由于中央方针、政策的正确，牧区党委对畜牧工作的重视，畜牧工作干部的努力，动员了广大群众的积极性和创造性；苏联专家的帮助和我国科学工作人员的研究创造也起了很大作用；国家对畜牧业给予了很大支援，除投资一亿五千万元外，还发放了大批贷款，大量收购了牲畜和畜产品，支持了畜牧业生产。
    邓子恢也谈到了我国牧业生产中现存的问题。他说，我国的畜牧业虽然有很大发展，但各种牲畜的数量都没有达到第一个五年计划的指标，只有羊接近完成计划，达到了计划数的98.1％。
    他指出，两三年来大牲畜的纯增率降低，1957年大家畜的头数还少于1956年，特别是驴的数量从1955年起一直下降，1957年比1954年减少一百八十万头，比解放前最高年份少了一百二十四点五万头。1957年马比1956年增加十四万头，水牛增加十五万头；但黄牛则减少一百一十二万头，骡子减少四万匹，驴减少四十三万头。增减相抵，1957年比1956年减少大牲畜一百三十万头。
    牲畜纯增率下降和原有牲畜减少的结果，农业区耕畜的负担加重了。河北省每头耕畜1952年平均负担三十七点六亩耕地，1957年增加到四十一点九亩。吉林省1957年每头耕畜负担的耕地面积也比1954年增加41％。在现有的耕畜中还有一个严重的情况是：老残多，壮畜多，幼畜少。据河北省统计，幼畜只占大牲畜总数的6％，老残畜占31％，壮畜占63％。幼畜太少，等壮畜变为老残之后，就将减少接替的耕畜，严重地影响农业生产。
    邓子恢指出，畜牧业生产还不够稳定的原因，从牧业区来说，首先是自然灾害。春夏的严重干旱和冬季的大风大雪都影响畜牧业的发展。第二是只是利用自然的水源和草原，还没有大量地进行水草方面的基本建设。由于受水草限制，在一个地区牲畜发展到一定数量的时候，便不能继续发展，甚至下降；在圈棚等基本建设方面也没有赶上去，不能抵抗风雪。第三是牲畜交流调剂工作做得不够，牧区的牲畜卖不出去，有些自生自灭，农业区又感耕畜不足。在调剂牲畜的时候，虽然价格政策基本合理，但在购销、地区、品种之间的差价上还有不够合理的地方，不能起鼓励生产的作用。第四是对牧区技术支援不够，防疫工作和供应优良种公畜等工作还没有完全跟上去。第五是畜产品加工业距离牧区太远，当作原料的畜产品向外运输困难，影响生产。第六，也是最重要的，是牧区的畜牧业社会主义改造还没有完成，牧业生产的脆弱性仍然存在。这样，牧区牲畜十年到十二年的周期性下降的规律还起着不小的作用。
    从农业区来说，产生耕畜不足、幼畜过少的原因，首先是重视不够。过去几年，在农业区从上到下存在着不同程度的重农轻牧的思想，对农牧业的依存关系认识不足，有些地区对机械化估计的过早，没有充分地认识到在相当长的时期内牲畜是我们农业生产的主要动力，因此放松了畜牧工作。第二，在实现农业合作化的过程中，我们对于原来支配小农经济的规律起了变化失去作用这一点预见不够，未能及时总结出一套适应集体经济新情况的保护和繁殖耕畜的有效办法。第三，不少地区耕畜入社作价偏低、只要壮畜不要幼畜或不允许社员饲养大家畜，也起了不良的影响。第四，农业社对牲畜饲养管理工作还做得不够好。开始有些地方过分集中饲养，养得不好，后来实行分队、分户、分犋喂养，曾起了很大作用。原来的饲养办法比较合理的，当然不必再改变，但是，有些地方有些合作社应该分散喂养的，而干部思想上还不通，没有很好的执行。第五，农业社中耕畜役使和保护母畜孕畜的矛盾，未能很好解决，对于繁殖幼畜也没有从饲养管理和配种保胎方面订出一定的制度和奖励办法。第六，对牲畜的调剂工作做得不够好。牲畜运销的旧的系统已经打断，新系统还没有完全建立，各地长期停留于禁运状态，牲畜的调剂贩运工作陷于停滞；还有的地方禁宰过严，确实该宰的老残畜不能宰杀，这都影响牲畜的增殖。此外，有些地区饲料不足问题还未解决，也是牲畜下降的重要原因之一。
    接着，邓子恢同志谈到了今后畜牧业发展的方针和任务。
    他说，我国经营畜牧业的地区，大体上可分三种类型。一类是北方草原牧区，一类是南方山地牧区，再一类是一般农业区。
    草原牧区主要是内蒙古、青海、甘肃、新疆、川西北等地区。这些地区的特点是：90％以上都是少数民族居住，他们世世代代经营畜牧业，有丰富经验，这是优点，但人民文化水平较低，还有些不良风俗习惯，对牧业发展有影响；各个牧区民主改革、社会主义改造的进度不同，在目前的生产关系和技术条件下，畜牧业生产还存在着脆弱性和不稳定性；畜牧业生产的商品性虽然很大，但交通不便，地广人稀，对畜牧业的发展不无影响。为此，草原牧区发展畜牧业生产的方针是：在积极而又稳步地进行社会主义改造的基础上积极发展畜牧业，逐步改游牧为定居放牧，实行农牧业结合（首先是饲料生产）兼营畜产品加工业等副业生产，发展以牧业为中心的多种经济。
    山地牧区包括长江以南和长江流域各省，这些地区发展畜牧业生产的方针是：在争取粮食、油料自给有余的基础上，在不破坏水土保持的原则下，积极发展畜牧业，发展农林牧副业相结合的多种经济。
    邓子恢指出，不论草原牧区和山地牧区，它们的任务是：不仅要发展牲畜，而且要外调牲畜，不仅要供应肉食和畜产品，而且要对农业区畜力不足的地方提供耕畜和役畜。
    一般农业区发展畜牧业的任务是：要逐步做到所需牲畜自养自给或部分自给。
    邓子恢在谈了牧区社会主义改造的问题以后，又谈到了牧区的生产建设问题。他说，逐步提高牲畜纯增率是牧区扩大再生产的基本关键。牲畜每年纯增率要求达到8％—10％。为了保证达到这个纯增率，应该增加牲畜繁殖率，提高成活率，做到保配、保胎、保生、保活；外调的牲畜应有一定的比例；对牲畜的消费率也应有一定的控制，而最根本的是要减少灾害死亡。
    他指出，提高牲畜纯增率的重要环节，是加强牧业的基本建设工作。首先，要进行牧区的水利建设，有水才有草，水草充足，牧业才能发展。第二，要做好草原保护、培育、改良和管理工作。在合作化的基础上要适当调整草原的使用范围和权利，要有计划地轮牧，以利牧草的生长。第三，要逐步推行定居放牧，农牧结合，种植饲料和牧民消费的粮食作物。第四，为了提高纯增率，要推行分群放牧，改进畜群构成，提高适龄母畜的比例，按期配种，还要修盖棚圈，贮草备料，消灭兽害，以减少损失。对牧民要提倡节俭，减少牲畜的消费。此外，还要改良畜种，加强防疫工作，培养畜牧兽医干部，增强技术指导力量。
    关于农业区发展畜牧业的问题，邓子恢说，首先要大声疾呼，让各地认识农牧业的相互依存关系，当前耕畜减少、不重视幼畜的现象如不改变，对农业生产就是一个很大威胁。为了在农业区逐步做到所需牲畜自养自给或大部自给，在大力发展农业生产的同时，还要大力发展畜牧业，不仅农业社要养牲畜，社员家家都可饲养一定数量的牲畜。大牲畜以社养为主，但应允许社员私养；小牲畜要以私养为主，只要社员不妨害集体生产，不要盲目限制。各农业社都应争取自养种公畜，保护母畜，保配、保胎、保生、保活，逐步繁殖，自力更生，逐渐解决畜力不足问题。为了保护现有耕畜，农业社应该改善饲养管理和使用制度，应该大力推广分队、分户、分犋喂养、养用合一的制度。这是一种最好的制度。凡是耕畜饲养管理目前还存在着严重问题，还没有找到合理解决办法的地方，应该同社员研究，采用这种办法或者其他合理的改进办法。此外，农业社还要建立各种奖励制度，以推动养畜爱畜工作。
    邓子恢说，农业区达到牲畜自给的一个重要办法，应该是各省在山区建立省、专区、县的牲畜基地，大力繁殖，以便满足省、专区、县内农业区的需要。此外，不能全部自给或当前急需补充耕畜的农业区，要由牧区大力供应；国营农场有一批壮畜，应适当降价出售，就近支援农区生产。
    解决草料不足的困难，是发展农业区畜牧业的一个急需解决的问题，他在这方面也做了指示。邓子恢着重赞扬了吉林省按耕畜留一定饲料基地的办法，他说这是保证耕畜饲料供应、保证耕畜健壮繁殖的最根本措施，要各地大力推广。
    关于同畜牧业有关的经济工作，邓子恢也作了详细指示。他说，耕畜、役畜、幼畜和肉畜的经营要统一起来，城市服务部和全国供销合作总社已经取得一致意见，应即召开有关人员会议，商讨统一经营办法和手续，并参照耕畜历史流转方向建立购销转运机构和草料站、骡马店等，以便尽速地调剂牲畜。在牲畜的采购工作上要贯彻服从生产的原则，收购规格要因地制宜，并要参照历史习惯，使能适应牲畜正常的淘汰规律；采购部门还要深入交通不便、牲畜较多的地区去收购，避免收购工作集中于交通沿线地区；在牧区收购要有一定比例，以保持产区的纯增率。收购价格也要合理，要规定最低保护价，保证养畜户有利，要克服压级压价现象。
    他说，为了促进畜牧业的发展，畜产品加工企业应该下放到牧区，还要逐步发展草原牧区和山地牧区的交通运输事业。
    邓子恢最后说，“加强领导，全面规划”是发展畜牧业的关键。为此，各地要书记负责，加强党委对畜牧业的领导，并要有专门机构专管这个工作。还要订出五年、十年和当年发展畜牧业的规划，这个规划不仅要有发展大小牲畜的头数，还要把供应牲畜和畜产品的数量包括进去。
    他说，今冬明春的首要工作是保护牲畜安全过冬。为了解决部分农业区耕畜不足的困难，在明年春耕以前要从内蒙古和南方各省牧区调一定数量的耕畜予以供应，有关部门应当把调剂耕畜的工作当做一项重要的政治任务，保证完成。
