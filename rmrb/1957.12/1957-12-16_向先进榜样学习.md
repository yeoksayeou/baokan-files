    Learn from Advanced Role Models
    The Liaoning Daily published an editorial on the 12th titled "Learn from Advanced Role Models and Make Greater Contributions in the New Upsurge of Industrial Production." The following is a summary:
    Wang Hengcheng, a famous coal miner from Benxi Coal Mine, and the team he led, completed the work planned for April 1960 in November 1957. Their brilliant labor achievements demonstrate the heroic spirit of the working class, as well as their intelligence, creativity, and noble qualities.
    In our country's socialist construction, tens of thousands of advanced producers and advanced units are constantly emerging. If each of us on our respective posts catches up quickly, learns from their work attitude and creative spirit, and makes the outstanding achievements we should, socialist construction will advance by leaps and bounds.
    The reason why Wang Hengcheng and other advanced producers can create advanced production records is mainly because they have a high degree of production enthusiasm. This surging labor enthusiasm and initiative are based on advanced thinking. This advanced thinking is the class consciousness and sense of responsibility of the masters of the country. Advanced producers can correctly combine the interests of the country with their personal interests, and thus can continuously make outstanding achievements in production or work.
    To make great achievements in production or work, we must also have advanced technology and advanced working methods. Wang Hengcheng and his team often pay attention to learning and studying technology. Their learning is creative, able to combine with production practice, and apply the advanced experience of others on the basis of their own experience, constantly enriching and developing advanced experience. We must learn their spirit of studying diligently, assiduously learn advanced technology and business, and improve our own production and work capabilities.
    In order to make greater achievements in production and work, we must also be good at cooperating and working with comrades around us. Only with unity and mutual assistance between comrades, and everyone working together, can we do things better. All the comrades in Wang Hengcheng's team are closely united from life to production, helping each other, especially the technically skilled and advanced helping the technically less skilled and backward, so that the technology of the whole team has reached an advanced level.
    To remain advanced in production forever and make the greatest contribution to socialist construction, we must also learn the valuable qualities of Wang Hengcheng's team in being modest and prudent. Wang Hengcheng's team has been repeatedly named advanced producers and has been continuously praised and rewarded. However, they did not treat the honor given to them by the Party and the people as a burden; on the contrary, they cherished this honor and regarded it as a driving force to motivate them to move forward, always modestly learning and improving their technology, and learning from the advanced experiences of others. Therefore, they have always maintained their honor and advanced further on the basis of their progress.

    向先进榜样学习
    辽宁日报在12日发表了题为“向先进榜样学习，在工业生产新高潮中作出更大的贡献”的社论。摘要如下：
    著名的本溪煤矿工人王恒成和他领导的小组，在1957年11月，已经做完了1960年4月份的工作。他们的光辉的劳动成就，显示了工人阶级的英雄气魄，显示了工人阶级的聪明智慧、创造性和高贵品质。
    在我国社会主义建设当中，不断涌现出成千上万的先进生产者和先进单位。如果我们每个人都在自己的岗位上，急起直追，学习他们的劳动态度和创造精神，做出应有的卓越的成绩，那么，社会主义建设就会飞跃前进。
    王恒成和其他先进生产者所以能创造先进的生产纪录，主要是因为他们有高度的生产积极性，而高涨的劳动热情和积极性，是以先进思想做基础的。这个先进思想就是主人翁的阶级觉悟和责任感。先进生产者们能够把国家的利益和个人的利益正确地结合起来，因而能在生产或工作上不断做出卓绝的成绩。
    在生产或工作上要做出巨大成绩，还要有先进的技术和先进的工作方法。王恒成和他领导的小组经常注意学习和钻研技术。他们的学习是创造性的，能够结合生产实际，在自己的经验基础上运用别人的先进经验，不断地充实、发展先进经验。我们要学习他们的钻研精神，刻苦学习先进技术和业务，提高自己的生产和工作能力。
    为了在生产和工作上做出更大的成绩，我们还要善于和自己周围同志合作共事，只有同志间的团结互助，大家一齐努力，我们才能把事情做得更好。王恒成小组的全体同志从生活到生产都能紧密团结，互相帮助，特别是技术高的、先进的帮助技术低的、落后的，因而使全组的技术都达到了先进水平。
    要在生产上永远保持先进，为社会主义建设做出最大的贡献，我们还要学习王恒成小组虚心谨慎的可贵品质。王恒成小组先后多次被评为先进生产者，不断地受到表扬奖励，但是，他们并没有把党和人民给他们的荣誉当做包袱背起来；相反，他们珍重这个荣誉，把它当做激励自己前进的动力，一直虚心学习提高技术，学习别人的先进经验。因此，他们一直保持住荣誉，在前进的基础上再前进。
