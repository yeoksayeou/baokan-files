Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 10th: According to TASS, the head of the Egyptian cultural workers delegation, Egyptian Minister of National Guidance Fathi Radwan, delivered a televised broadcast speech in Moscow on December 8th. The Egyptian delegation is visiting the Soviet Union at the invitation of the Soviet Ministry of Culture. Radwan said that in the Soviet Union, we have been received with sincere friendship and cordial hospitality. This is particularly gratifying, because the Egyptian people's struggle is not only a struggle for their own rights and national independence, but in fact also a struggle for the liberation of weak nations. Radwan said that we are very pleased to hear that the Soviet Union hopes to strengthen relations with Egypt. The cooperation between the people of Egypt and the Soviet Union is neither imposed nor pursuing any political or economic purpose, but is free cooperation.

    埃及文化代表团团长拉德温说
    埃苏合作是自由合作
    据新华社10日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：埃及文化工作者代表团团长、埃及国家指导部长法西·拉德温12月8日在莫斯科发表电视广播演说。埃及代表团是应苏联文化部的邀请访问苏联的。拉德温说，在苏联，我们受到了真诚友好和亲切的招待。这是特别令人高兴的，因为埃及人民的斗争不仅是争取自己权利和民族独立的斗争，实际上也是争取解放弱小民族的斗争。拉德温说，我们很高兴地听到，苏联期望加强同埃及的关系。埃及和苏联两国人民的合作既不是强加的，也不是追求任何政治目的或者经济目的，而是自由的合作。
