    The Play "A Gallery of Ugly Characters"
    Soviet Drama Expert Ge·Ni·Guli Yefu
    Recently, I watched the Experimental Drama Theater's performance of "A Gallery of Ugly Characters," which left a very deep impression on me. I feel that this performance is of extremely great significance.
    First of all, I would like to point out that this play is very much in line with current requirements and has a high degree of realism. The struggle against right-wing elements is still going on fiercely, and the theater has already been able to produce a complete and mature play to reflect this struggle. This example powerfully demonstrates that the notion that artistic creation cannot keep up with the pace of life and that artistic creation must lag behind the progress of reality is absurd. The Experimental Drama Theater convincingly proves that stage art has every right to be an active participant in the current phenomena of social life, and it can powerfully intervene in the political situation and put forward its own evaluations with significant educational significance. Moreover, the theater also proves that this evaluation can have not only ideological value but also artistic value. This performance by the Experimental Drama Theater is not only fresh and realistic in terms of content, but also very interesting and infectious in form, making it easy for the audience to accept. All of this shows that the theater has not failed its title in the slightest. In the field of art, it often happens that new content will generate new art forms, as long as the content is reflected through genuine creation. This is the case here. And this is true not only for the script itself, but also for the theater's director.
    In modern Chinese drama, the purely comedic genre has not been sufficiently promoted. However, in recent years, the first batch of interesting political comedy scripts have appeared, such as Ai Mingzhi's "Happiness," Lao She's "Looking West to Chang'an," He Qiu's "Before the New Director Arrives," and so on. Although these scripts are different, they can all be classified into this genre. The script "A Gallery of Ugly Characters" not only continues in this direction, but also strengthens the political theme, expressing the theme through powerful satire and employing the techniques of popular comedy and farce, thereby endowing this genre with new qualities. The script uses ridicule to expose, and the drama uses ridicule to educate the audience's consciousness, and it adopts the boldest and sharpest comedic techniques. I think the drama has a legitimate right to do so. This tradition of expressing serious political themes in sharp and exaggerated comedic form can be found in folk comedies (including Chinese ones) in any country. As for Western European professional theaters, the brilliant example of Aristophanes' comedies in the fifth century BC has inherited this tradition.
    The realism of the script "A Gallery of Ugly Characters" is not only reflected in its theme and plot; the images of the heads of various right-wing political groups in the script, such as the editor, the American-educated professor, the unpopular actress, and the young hooligan, accurately reflect today's political struggle. Each character is correctly portrayed, and they are depicted based on concrete figures in reality, while also reflecting the typical figures of various negative phenomena in society that have been exposed in this political struggle. I don't understand Chinese and must rely on translation to understand. Although I only grasped a portion of the lines, I clearly felt that the lines were written based on real-life materials, and the dialogue between the characters correctly reflected the views and arguments that can be encountered every day in today's practice of ideological struggle. Undoubtedly, all of this is an advantage of the script, which is why it was immediately selected by several theaters. This is completely understandable. Of course, this does not mean that the script has no shortcomings. The dramatic structure of the script is by its nature close to the genre of political commentary, in which some individual scenes are permeated with the overall theme and the same plot. Therefore, the script can be divided into three main parts, which can be roughly titled: "The Conspiracy of Monsters and Demons," "Beating Drums in Unison," and "Deserved Punishment." I feel that the author is most successful in the first part, where the nature of the events and characters is expressed through relatively typical and sharp phenomena. In the second part, the tactics of the conspirators, who attempt to deceive those with wavering positions and incite them, are interestingly portrayed. This point is also very correct and typical. However, here it gives the impression that the "tricks" played by these cunning people are too naive and too incompetent, and therefore not dangerous at all. Of course, I may not be right, because as mentioned above, I only grasped a portion of the lines. But the further it goes, the more one feels that all of this small group of people is helpless, so the script seems to be "using a cannon to shoot sparrows" to some extent. I think the author made his characters fail too quickly and easily. I think it would be more interesting and realistic if, before this failure, he increased the illusion of their success and their illusory victory, continuing the thread of "dreaming of eating immortal fruit" that was so vividly expressed at the end of the first act. In the third part, these unfortunate fools are not so much exposed by others as they expose themselves, retreating from their positions in a panic. It might be better if the exposure were expressed through action rather than through dialogue, and if it occurred precisely when these "heroes" were reveling in their fanciful victory. Using the method of posting big-character posters to achieve this may be appropriate, because big-character posters played a great role in this political movement, and at the same time could provide great possibilities for this exposure to have the sharp "comic" elements of political cartoons. The role of the positive character Wang Shiquan in the script is written very poorly and conceptually. His appearance is purely for the sake of the plot, but he himself does not have the thoughts and feelings to resist the philosophy of life of those negative characters who follow the tide. Perhaps removing this role would also be possible. There is no need to embody public opinion through him in the script, because public opinion is a force that will inevitably lead to the failure of this small group of vicious political conspirators. If this role must be added, then it should be developed more deeply. These shortcomings that I have raised regarding the larger aspects of the script in no way detract from its artistic value and ideological realism, because this script is a first attempt at a very needed and very timely genre. The fact that several stage scripts have already appeared based on this script best proves this.
    I think the Experimental Drama Theater's creation is an artistically innovative initiative.

    话剧“百丑图”
    苏联戏剧专家　格·尼·古里也夫
    最近我看了实验话剧院演出的“百丑图”，给了我很深刻的印象。我感到这次演出具有极其重大的意义。
    首先我想指出的，这个戏非常符合当前的要求，具有高度的现实性。反对右派分子的斗争还在激烈进行，而剧院已经能拿出完整而成熟的戏来反映这一斗争。这个例子有力地说明了那些认为艺术创作不能赶上生活节拍、艺术创作一定落后于现实进展的说法，是荒谬的。实验话剧院令人信服地证明了，舞台艺术完全有权成为社会生活中当前各种现象的积极参与者，它可以有力的干预政治局势，提出自己的具有重大教育意义的评价。并且剧院还证明了，这个评价不仅可以有思想价值，而且还可以有艺术价值。实验话剧院的这次演出不仅从内容上来说是新鲜的现实的，而且从形式上来说也很有趣和富于感染力。使观众很容易接受。这一切都说明：话剧院丝毫没有辜负自己的称号。艺术事业中经常有这样的情形：新的内容会产生新的艺术形式，只要这个内容是通过真正的创作反映出来的。这里也是这样。而且不仅对剧本本身来说是如此，就是对剧院导演来说也是如此。
    在现代中国戏剧中，纯粹的喜剧体裁还没有得到足够的推广，不过，近几年来出现了第一批有趣的政治喜剧体裁的剧本；像艾明之的“幸福”、老舍的“西望长安”、何求的“新局长到来之前”等等这些剧本虽然各有不同，但都可以归入这类体裁。剧本“百丑图”不仅继续了这个方面，并且其中的政治主题也加强了，剧本通过有力的抨击的形式表现了主题，运用了通俗喜剧和闹剧的手法，从而赋于这种体裁以新的素质。剧本用嘲笑来揭露，戏剧以嘲笑来教育观众的意识，并且采用了最大胆而尖锐的喜剧手法。我想，戏剧在这方面是有合法权利的。这种用尖锐夸张的喜剧形式表现严重的政治主题的传统在任何国家的民间笑剧（包括中国在内）中都可以找到。至于说西欧的专业剧院，那么纪元前五世纪的阿里斯托芬喜剧的辉煌范例中，就已继承了这个传统。
    剧本“百丑图”的现实性不仅表现在它的主题和情节上，剧本所有各式各样右派政治集团的头目形象：编辑、美国大学毕业的教授、不吃香的女演员、年青的阿飞，正确地反映了今天的政治斗争。每一个人物都得到了正确的刻画，他们是根据现实中的具体人物描绘出来的，同时也反映了这次政治斗争过程中所揭露出来的社会上各种恶劣现象的典型人物。我不懂中文，必须依靠翻译才能听懂。虽然只领会了一部分台词，我也明显的感到台词是根据生活的材料写成，并且人物间的对话也正确的反映了今天思想斗争的实践中每天都可以遇到的那些看法和主张。毫无疑问，这一切都是剧本的优点，因此它立刻就被几个剧院选中。这是完全可以理解的。当然这也并不是说剧本没有缺点。剧本的戏剧结构就其性质来说近乎政治评论体裁，在这种体裁里有些单独的戏都是贯穿着总的主题和同一情节的。因此剧本可以分为三个主要部分，大致可以加上这样的标题：“牛鬼蛇神的阴谋”、“擂鼓齐放”和“罪有应得”。我感到作者最成功的是第一部分，这里的事件和人物性质都是通过比较典型和尖锐的现象表现出来的。在第二部分中，很有趣的表现了阴谋家的策略，他们企图蒙蔽那些立场不坚定的人们，向他们点火。这一点也很正确，很典型。但是这里却使人产生了一种印象，这些诡计多端的人所玩弄的“把戏”未免太幼稚了，太低能了，因此根本就不危险，我说得当然不一定对，因为上面已经提到过，我只领会了一部分台词。但是越到后面越使人感到，所有这一小撮人都是束手无策的，这样剧本在某种程度上来说就好像是在“用大炮轰麻雀”了。我觉得作者过于迅速而轻易地使他的人物遭到了失败。我想，如果在这个失败之前增加他们成功的假象和他们的虚幻的胜利，继续着第一场节尾时所十分鲜明地表现出来的“梦想吃仙果”这条线索的话，那么就会更有趣，更真实些。在第三部分中这些倒霉的笨家伙与其说是被人揭穿的，还不如说是他们自己在揭露自己，自己仓惶失措地退出阵地。如果揭露不是通过对话，而是通过行动来表现，并且恰好发生在这些“英雄们”陶醉于异想天开的胜利的时候，那么也许要好得多。利用贴大字报的方法来达到这一点，可能是恰当的，因为大字报在这次政治运动中起了很大的作用，同时还能提供极大的可能使这个揭露通过政治漫画具有表现的尖锐的“喜剧”成分。剧本中正面人物王士铨这个角色写得非常贫乏和概念化，他的出现纯粹是为了情节服务的，但他本身却没有和那些反面人物随波逐流的生活哲学相抗衡的思想感情。也许去掉这个角色也可以。不必在剧本中借他来体现社会舆论，因为社会舆论本来就是一种力量，必然会使这一小撮穷凶极恶的政治阴谋家遭到失败的。如果一定要加这个角色的话，那么应该把它发展得更深刻些。我对剧本的大的方面所提出的这些缺点丝毫也不抹煞它的艺术价值和思想的现实意义。因为该剧本是一种十分需要和十分适时的体裁的初次尝试。目前根据这个剧本已经出现了好几种舞台脚本，就最好地证明了这一点。
    实验话剧院的创作，我觉得是艺术上的一件具有革新意义的创举。
