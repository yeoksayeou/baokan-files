　　We Saw the Benefits of Going to the Mountains
　　By Our Correspondents　Yu Ming, Yu Feng
    They Have Already Settled Down
    As the red sun rose, we took a car from Xuan City in southern Anhui to Zhouwang Farm. Not long after leaving the city heading south, undulating hills and mountains appeared before us. Their slopes were not steep, and the terrain was not high, yet they were all undeveloped lands, with only a few scattered small pine trees and withered grass growing on them. We looked anxiously out of the car, hoping to see the first group of people who came to the mountains this year to develop these lands as soon as possible. The car passed through a high ground, and a group of fat pigs flashed past the car. At this time, two young people sitting behind us suddenly broke the silence in the car and began to talk. One asked, "Aren't those pigs from the farm?" The other then said, "They've been out grazing for a long time, really hardworking!" We looked back and faintly saw a man in a cadre uniform leading the pigs in front, and a young woman driving the pigs behind. The two comrades saw that we were paying attention to this, and told us that the cadre had come to the farm this spring to participate in production with them, and the woman behind was his family member. They pointed to the hills and mountains outside the car window and said that these had already been划进into the farm's operating area, and the farm was more than one hundred miles around! They also said that they had patrolled these undeveloped areas when they checked for wild animals on summer nights. They spoke these words particularly loudly, as if they were proud of this heroic labor, and as if they were deliberately telling us that they were also people of the farm.
    The car arrived at Yangliupu, forty miles from Xuan City. After introductions, we learned that their names were Cao Youhe and You Guoxing. They enthusiastically led us to the farm office. These five miles also passed through several hills and mountains, but the scene was different from what we had already seen. The land cleared on the slopes and tops of the hills was flat and tidy. People in cadre uniforms were working in piles here and there. Some were digging peanuts, some were carrying sweet potatoes, and tobacco and radishes were everywhere. Some were also building houses. We heard that dozens of cadres had already built thatched huts at their own expense and brought their families over.
      New Farm　New Laborers
    When we arrived at the farm, we felt particularly refreshed. Here, Tian Zhi Ze, the Deputy Director of the Department of Commerce, became the farm director. Managers of various commercial companies at the provincial, special district, and county levels became the captains and leaders of the various operating areas. They and the cadres transferred from the finance and trade system are now all laborers on the farm. This farm was entirely created by these seven hundred cadres with their own hands. They responded to the call of the Party this spring and went to the mountains. In just a few months, the appearance of the mountainous areas and themselves has undergone great changes. The farmers here only used the relatively low-lying land for farming, but those hills and mountains, which were many times larger, were sleeping there. The farmers believed that these lands could not grow good crops. As soon as these cadres went to the mountains, they broke this notion. They turned barren mountains into treasure mountains. They reclaimed more than six thousand acres of land in a few months. Now is the first autumn harvest on the farm, and we saw that every laborer on the farm was beaming with joy. On the land that people used to think could not grow crops, they harvested more than 1,500 catties of sweet potatoes per acre in more than 1,000 acres of land, and nearly 200 catties of peanuts per acre in another more than 1,000 acres of land. Radishes as thick as bowls are still growing. Although the farm laborers are still wearing cadre clothes, they are carrying sweet potatoes and peanuts weighing more than 100 catties, and they are no different from ordinary farmers. Their families also began to participate in labor on the farm. They are carefully selecting sweet potatoes and peanuts in the fields full of them, preparing them for storage.
    In the rabbit farm, we saw more than two hundred snow-white, fine-haired superior breed young rabbits. Those who used to work in banks, department stores, and supply and marketing cooperatives are now raising them here. We saw these comrades serving them in the rabbit farm all day long, feeding them for a while, checking for diseases for a while, and cleaning the rabbit cages again and again. At first, rabbits died, but later, because they mastered the habits of rabbits, they not only stopped the deaths, but also fed the rabbits very healthy. There are already more than three hundred breeding pigs on the pig farm. Those cadres who used to sit in offices are now rolling up their trouser legs, wearing straw sandals, carrying pig manure, and mixing pig feed, and they all seem very natural and happy. They said, how wonderful it would be to raise herds of big fat pigs in the barren mountains!
    In the Caijiaxiang operating area, these new-type agricultural laborers carried out fresh and very meaningful experimental work. Here in Qingfeng Mountain and Huatuo Ridge, they planted mulberry trees for developing sericulture, tung oil trees for producing tung oil, Eucommia ulmoides trees for making rubber, and oil tea trees for producing edible oil. They also planted valuable medicinal materials such as Atractylodes macrocephala, Rehmannia glutinosa, and Codonopsis pilosula. Now these have all been successfully tested. Large areas of mulberry gardens have appeared in the barren mountains. The mulberry trees have grown to more than two meters high. The tung trees they planted stretch for nearly two thousand acres. As the saying goes, "If you have four tung trees in your family, your descendants will never be poor." How can such a large area of tung trees not be pleasing! Valuable medicinal materials such as Atractylodes macrocephala and Rehmannia glutinosa are also growing well. The most striking thing is the large area of Eucommia ulmoides trees. It has grown to more than two feet high. If you pick a leaf and tear it open, you can see strands of胶质gelatinous substance, which is very tough. The masses call it "silk cotton tree", which is an important industrial raw material. These economic forests and medicinal materials are very novel. Their successful trial planting has greatly encouraged the people on the farm's enthusiasm for the construction of mountainous areas.
    The fruits of their labor in half a year are very considerable. In the process of creating these achievements, people have also undergone major changes. Comrade Cha Fude, Deputy Secretary of the Farm Party Committee, said: When the farm was first established this spring, because food and accommodation were difficult, and most people had not participated in physical labor, their thoughts were relatively chaotic. Some pretended to be sick and did not produce, some left without saying goodbye, and some made a lot of noise to the leaders. However, after the Party's education, the actual training of labor, and the influence of leading cadres taking the lead in production, more than 90% of the people have settled down. At first, many people were afraid that they could not do heavy physical labor, but now no one cares about this anymore. Fan Xiufu was unwilling to participate in labor when he first came to Xuan City. He made trouble from the team to the farm and to the county, saying that his leg was sick and painful, and he asked to resign. Under the influence of the Party's education and most comrades, he has now changed and actively participates in labor. When we met him, he was buying straw for the operating area from other places. His bare feet were covered with mud after the rain. We asked him, "Does your leg still hurt?" He said, "Now that my thinking is clear, my leg doesn't hurt anymore." We asked him, "Have you settled down now?" He said, "If I didn't settle down, would I be building a thatched hut here?" It turned out that he was also one of those who built a house at his own expense to settle down.
          A Miniature of Southern Anhui Mountainous Area
    One evening, we talked with Wu Yu, Liu Zhenhua and other responsible persons. Comrade Wu Yu was originally the manager of the Provincial Electric Company. He was forty-six years old. When he heard that the farm needed people this spring, he applied to the leadership seven times before coming to this glorious position. After coming to the farm, he has been taking the lead in production. Liu Zhenhua, Deputy Director of the Office of the Department of Commerce, is also over fifty years old this year. He also took the initiative to come to develop the mountainous area this spring. During the Southern Anhui Incident, he was captured by the enemy and suffered torture in the concentration camp. After escaping, he persisted in the arduous struggle in the Yangtze River area. His body was very bad, but he was unwilling to squat in the office. He was the one who led the first group of cadres to step on the ice and snow to develop the mountainous area.
    Comrade Liu Zhenhua introduced the farm's long-term plan in detail.
    He said: "The farm's policy is to focus on forestry and animal husbandry, and agriculture will be used to support animal husbandry. In 1958, according to the成林interval period of five years for picking tung seeds, eight years for picking oil tea, and fifteen years for cutting Eucommia ulmoides stems and leaves, the entire farm will plant 10,000 acres of tung trees, interplant 10,000 acres of oil tea, and transplant 1,000 acres of Eucommia ulmoides. By 1962, Eucommia ulmoides will be planted to more than 2,000 acres. After more than ten years, the products of these trees will not only supply the urgent needs of national construction, but will also be literally money-spinning trees! It is enough to pick at least two catties per tree after tung trees bear seeds in 1962, and the income will be equal to the salaries of all the staff in the office now. As for Eucommia ulmoides, the value of the胶胶rubber produced per acre after fifteen years of成林 forest will be even greater." He said excitedly: "Eucommia ulmoides is still planted like this. When it grows up, it is cut down for胶rubber production, and it will grow again by itself, and it will grow more and more as it is cut. This is really benefiting future generations!"
    "In addition to the above economic forests, a large number of mulberry trees, tea trees, Ulmus davidiana trees and palm trees will also be planted. Various excellent varieties of apples, pears, peaches, loquats, oranges and grapes, jujube trees, etc. will also be planted in the forest for more than 2,000 acres, as well as a large number of timber forests. By 1962, more than 18,000 acres of barren mountains will really be green trees and flowers and fruits all over the mountains."
    "By 1962, the farm will raise 35,000 pigs, 3,000 cattle, and also raise a large number of rabbits, sheep, bees and silkworms. In addition to ensuring self-sufficiency in food, the tens of thousands of acres of crops will mainly be used to solve the feed problem. These cultivated lands will also be planted with ramie, flue-cured tobacco, cotton, peanuts, etc."
    "By 1962, the valuable medicinal materials planted on the farm, such as Paeonia lactiflora, Atractylodes macrocephala, Rehmannia glutinosa, chrysanthemum, Chaenomeles speciosa, Codonopsis pilosula, etc., will reach more than 1,000 acres." He finally said: "By 1962, Zhouwang Farm will process various products produced by itself. There will be small silk and麻hemp textile factories, tea preliminary processing factories, vermicelli processing factories, food processing factories, and medicinal material processing factories. At that time, machine noises will be heard everywhere in this barren mountain. At that time, the number of people on the farm will double compared to now. There will be something to do all year round. All the families on the farm will be able to participate in production, and it will also be of great benefit to the vast local farmers."
    After Comrade Liu Zhenhua finished talking about the future of this barren mountain, he said meaningfully: "I am old, and I really hope that it can be realized soon." In fact, not only old people are eager to see this beautiful mountainous area, but how many young people on the farm are dreaming about it! This long-term plan has become the driving force for encouraging the farm laborers to work enthusiastically.
    After we left Zhouwang Farm, we continued to visit southern Anhui. We saw that Xuan City was only the beginning of entering the mountainous area of southern Anhui. The deeper we went into the mountainous area of southern Anhui, the more we felt the urgent need for the development of the mountainous area, and the more we felt the great significance of the successful trial planting of economic forests and medicinal materials and the development of animal husbandry in Zhouwang Farm. The vision of Zhouwang Farm is no less than creating a microcosm for the future of the entire mountainous area of southern Anhui. The mountainous area of southern Anhui was originally beautiful and rich. If someone goes to the mountains to carefully transform the entire mountainous area like Zhouwang Farm, changes the large areas of miscellaneous trees into money-making trees such as tung trees, oil tea, Eucommia ulmoides, mulberry trees, tea trees, etc., and removes the weeds all over the mountains and plains, and plants various medicinal materials and economic crops, then it will become more beautiful and richer.

　　我们看到了上山的好处
　　本报记者　于明　于风
    他们已经安家落户
    红日初升，我们从皖南宣城乘汽车去周王农场。出城南行不久，连绵起伏的丘陵山岗便出现在眼前。它们的坡度不大，地势也并不高，然而却都是没有被开发利用的土地，上面只稀稀落落长着一些小松树和枯草。我们焦急地向车外张望，希望快点看到今年第一批上山来开发这些土地的人们。汽车从一段高地经过，路旁一群肥猪一晃便落在车后，这时，坐在我们座后的两个青年忽然打破车里沉默，谈论起来，一个问道：“这不是场里的猪吗？”一个接着便说：“他们这早就出来放了，真干！”我们朝车后一望，隐隐看到前边领猪的是一个穿干部服的男人，后面赶猪的是一个年青妇女。那两个同志看到我们注意这件事，便告诉我们，那个干部是今春到农场来和他们一起参加生产的，后边的妇女就是他的家属。他们指着车窗外的丘陵山岗说，这些都已经划进农场作业区了，农场周围有一百多里地哩！还说，他们在夏夜巡查野兽时，连这些未开发的地方都转过了。他们对这些话说得特别响亮，好像是在为这种豪迈的劳动骄傲，又像是在故意告诉我们，他们也是农场的人。
    汽车到了离宣城四十里的杨柳铺，彼此作了介绍，我们才知道他们的名字叫做曹友和、尤国兴。他们兴致勃勃地领我们到农场办公室去。这五里路也经过几个丘陵山岗，但是情景和已走过的不一样，坡地上、岗顶上被开出的土地平平整整，穿干部服劳动的人这里一堆那里一堆，他们有的正在刨花生、有的正在挑送山芋，烟叶、萝卜还满地都是。他们还有的在盖房子，我们听说有几十个干部已经自己出钱盖起草屋，把家属都接来了。
      新的农场　新的劳动者
    到了农场，我们特别感到新鲜。在这里，商业厅副厅长田之泽当了农场场长，省、专、县各种各样商业公司的经理，变成了各作业区的队长和组长，他们和财贸系统抽调来的干部，现在都是农场的劳动者，这个农场完全是这七百多干部用自己的双手创建起来的。他们在今春响应党的号召上了山，仅仅几个月，就使山区的面貌和他们自己本身发生了很大的变化。这里的农民只利用了比较低平的土地种田，但是那些比这大过不知道多少倍的丘陵山岗地，却在那里沉睡着。农民认为这些土地长不出好庄稼来。这些干部一上山，便把这种观念打破了，他们把荒山变成了宝山。他们几个月便开垦了六千多亩土地。现在正是农场第一个秋收，我们看到农场劳动者个个喜笑颜开，他们就在过去人们认为不能长庄稼的土地上，在一千多亩的地里，每亩收获一千五百多斤山芋，在另一千多亩的地里每亩收获了花生近二百斤。碗口粗的萝卜还正在生长着。农场劳动者虽然穿的还都是干部衣服，但是每人挑起百多斤重的山芋、花生，却和一般农民没有多少分别了。他们的家属也在农场开始参加劳动，她们在堆满山芋、花生的场地上精心地挑选着，准备入仓。
    在养兔房里，我们看到有二百多只雪白细毛的优种仔兔，在这里饲养它们的有原在银行工作的，有在百货公司和供销社工作的。我们看到这些同志整天在兔房里服侍着它们，一会儿喂食了，一会儿检查疾病了，一次又一次地打扫兔笼。最初兔子还有死亡，后来因为他们掌握了兔子的习性，不但制止了死亡，而且把兔子喂得很健康。在猪场里已经有三百多头种猪了，那些原来是坐机关的干部，现在挽起裤脚、穿着草鞋，挑猪粪，拌猪食，都表现得很自然愉快。他们说，在荒山上饲养出成群的大肥猪来，那有多么好啊！
    在蔡家巷作业区，这些新型的农业劳动者，进行了新鲜而有很大意义的试验工作。他们在这里的青峰山和华佗岭栽上了发展蚕丝的桑树、生产桐油的油桐树、能够制橡胶的杜仲树、能产食油的油茶树，他们还种了贵重的药材白术、生地、党参等。现在这都试验成功了。荒山上出现了大片的桑园，桑树长得已有两公尺高，他们栽的桐树连绵近两千亩，俗话说：“家有四棵桐，子孙万代不怕穷”，这样大面积的桐树怎能不逗人喜欢！贵重药材白术、生地等也长得很好。最引人注意的是那大片的杜仲树，它已长得有二尺多高，把它的叶子摘下一片来撕开，便可看到一丝一丝的胶质，很是坚韧，群众都称它为“丝棉树”，是重要的工业原料。这些经济林木和药材是十分新奇的，它们的试种成功，大大鼓舞了农场的人们对山区的建设热情。
    他们在半年里劳动的成果，是十分可观的。创造这些成果的过程中，也使人发生了重大的变化。农场党委副书记查富德同志说：在今年春天农场刚一成立时，因为食宿都较困难，绝大多数人又没有参加过体力劳动，所以思想比较混乱，有装病不生产的，有不辞而去的，有向领导大吵大闹的。但是经过党的教育，劳动的实际锻炼，领导骨干亲自带头生产的影响，90％以上的人，都安定下来了。最初很多人都怕自己作不了重体力劳动，现在没有人再顾虑这一点了。樊秀富从宣城刚来时，不愿意参加劳动，他从队里一直闹到场里，县里，说他腿有病，发痛，要求退职。他在党的教育和大多数同志的影响下，现在也转变过来，积极参加劳动了。我们见到他时，他正从外地为作业区买稻草回来，在雨后两只赤脚上沾满了泥，我们问他：“现在腿还痛吗？”他说：“现在思想通了，腿也不痛了。”我们问他：“现在安定下来了吗？”他说：“不安定下来，我还在这里盖草屋？”原来他也是自己出钱盖屋安居落户的一个。
          皖南山区的缩影
    一个晚间，我们和吴裕、刘镇华等负责人谈话。吴裕同志原是省交电公司的经理，已四十六岁，今春听到农场需要人时，向领导申请了七次，才来到这个光荣的岗位上。他来农场后，一直带头生产。商业厅办公室副主任刘镇华，今年也五十多岁了，他也是今春主动要求来开发山区的一个。他在皖南事变时，被敌人捉去在集中营受尽了折磨，逃出后，又在沿江一带坚持了艰苦的斗争。身体很坏，但他却不愿意蹲在机关里，他是率领第一批干部踏着冰雪到这里来开发山区的人。
    刘镇华同志详细介绍了农场的远景规划。
    他说：“这个农场的方针，是以林牧业为主，农业将用来支持畜牧业。全农场在1958年按照五年采桐籽，八年摘油茶，十五年刈割杜仲茎叶的成林间隔期，将栽桐树一万亩，间种油茶一万亩，移栽杜仲一千亩，到1962年，杜仲将栽到二千多亩。十几年后，这些林木的产品不但可以供应国家建设急需，而且简直都是摇钱树！只是桐树到1962年结籽后，每棵最少采摘二斤，所得就可抵上现在全场人员在机关所得的工资了。至于杜仲，在十五年成林后，每亩产胶的价值就更大了。”他兴奋地说：“杜仲还是这么种树，长大了，砍掉制胶，自己还会再长起来，而且是越砍越发的多，这真是为子孙万代造福！”
    “除了以上几种经济林，还将栽种大量桑树、茶树、乌?树和棕树。在林木中还将栽种各种优良品种的苹果、梨树、桃树、枇杷、橘子和葡萄、枣树等二千多亩及大量用材林。到1962年，一万八千多亩的荒山就真的绿树成林，花果满山了。”
    “农场到1962年将饲养生猪三万五千头，牛三千头，还将饲养大量的兔子、羊、蜜蜂和蚕。成万亩的农作物，除保证自给食用外，将以解决饲料为主。这些耕地中还要种植苎麻、烤烟、棉花及花生等。”
    “到1962年农场种植的贵重药材白芍、白术、生地、菊花、宣木瓜、党参等将达千余亩。”他最后说：“到1962年周王农场将自己加工自己所出产的各种产品，这里将有小型丝麻纺织厂、茶叶初制厂、粉丝加工厂、食品加工厂、药材加工厂等。那时，这荒山里就会到处听到机器响动了。那时全场的人比现在增加一倍，一年四季也有事做，全场家属也都能参加生产，对当地广大农民也将有很大好处。”
    刘镇华同志谈完这个荒山的远景后，意味深长地说：“我的年龄大了，我真希望它能很快实现。”其实，不只老年人急于要求看到这种美丽的山区，全场有多少青年人作梦也在想着它哩！这个远景规划已成为鼓舞全场劳动者热情劳动的动力了。
    我们离开周王农场后，继续在皖南访问。我们看到宣城县只不过是进入皖南山区的开始，越深入皖南山区，便越发感到山区的急待开发，越发感到周王农场试种经济林、药材成功，及发展畜牧业的重大意义了。周王农场的远景，不啻为皖南整个山区的将来制造了一个缩影。皖南山区原来就是美丽的、富裕的，如果有人上山来把整个山区像周王农场一样精心改造，把那大片大片的杂树改变成像桐树、油茶、杜仲、桑树、茶树等的摇钱树，把那满山遍野的杂草除掉，种上各种各样的药材和经济作物，那么它将会变得更美丽、更富裕。
