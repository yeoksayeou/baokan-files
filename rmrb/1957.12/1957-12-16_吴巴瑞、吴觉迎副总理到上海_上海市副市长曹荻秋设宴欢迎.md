This place, one of the earliest occupied by imperialism, was once full of all kinds of evils. However, now Shanghai has cleared away the evils and become a city of the new socialist era. I cannot but like this, I cannot but feel honored to be a guest here, and I cannot but admire the people of Shanghai who are building socialism. Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe also announced that he would come to Shanghai again soon to inspect the construction of this city.
