Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch from Cape Canaveral: The "Vanguard" rocket, carrying America's first experimental satellite, was launched on the 6th and rose only a few feet before falling back to the ground and exploding.

The American authorities originally decided to launch this experimental satellite, weighing only 1.5 kilograms, on November 4th, but repeatedly postponed it until 16:45 Greenwich time on the 6th (more than two months after the Soviet Union launched its first artificial satellite). The U.S. Department of Defense announced that two seconds after the rocket was launched, the first stage lost thrust, the rocket somersaulted, fell headfirst back onto the launch pad, and exploded. People hiding in heavily walled protective rooms saw the rocket enveloped in flames after a puff of smoke. The first and second stages of the rocket were completely destroyed, and the third stage rocket, which contained the artificial satellite, fell down without burning. The launch pad was severely damaged. Fortunately, there were no casualties.

Smith, representing the "Vanguard" rocket launch headquarters, announced the launch failure, saying that it usually takes six weeks of round-the-clock work to prepare for a three-stage rocket launch. A spokesman for the Department of Defense in Washington said it would take about thirty days to conduct another test.

Dr. Hagen, the person in charge of the American satellite launch program, held a press conference more than two hours after the accident. He announced the news with a gloomy face. He said, "We have conducted a detailed study of all the records at hand, but so far, no one can be sure of the cause of this failure. For safety's sake, a careful examination of the third-stage rocket itself cannot be carried out yet."

Dr. Hagen also complained to reporters that he personally felt that the United States should not have disclosed too much information about this launch in advance, but others rejected him. He said that because of too much publicity, the public had become disoriented and could not see that this launch was only a test.

Hagen said that a new test would be carried out as quickly as possible, but he would not say when the test would be conducted.

Furthermore, the failure of the American satellite launch caused a stock market slump in New York, which is estimated to have caused a drop of more than 1.2 billion yuan in the prices of various stocks on the New York Stock Exchange.

　  新华社7日讯　卡纳维拉尔角消息：运载美国第一个试验性人造卫星的“先锋号”火箭，6日在发射后上升到离开地面才几英尺高就落回地面爆炸烧毁。
    美国当局原来决定在11月4日发射这个实际重量只有一点五公斤的试验性卫星，但是一而再再而三地推迟到6日（离苏联发射第一个人造卫星两个多月）的格林威治时间十六时四十五分才发射。美国国防部宣布，当火箭发射出去两秒钟以后，第一级火箭丧失了推力，火箭翻起跟斗，头朝东落回发射台，发生了爆炸。躲在重重厚壁保护室里的人们在一阵烟柱以后看见火箭被包围在燃烧的火焰中。火箭的第一级和第二级已全部烧毁，装着人造卫星的第三级火箭掉了下来没有烧坏。发射台遭到严重破坏。所幸尚未造成伤亡。
    代表“先锋号”火箭发射总部宣布发射失败消息的史密斯说，通常情况下，需要昼夜不停的六个星期的时间准备一次三级火箭的发射。华盛顿国防部的发言人则说，大约需要三十天的时间才能再进行下一次试验。
    美国发射人造卫星计划的负责人哈根博士在事故发生后两个多小时举行了记者招待会。他脸色阴沉地宣布了这个消息。他说：“我们已经对手头的所有记录进行了详细的研究，但是到目前为止，没有一个人能肯定地知道造成这次失败的原因。为了安全起见，现在还不能对三级火箭本身进行仔细的检查。”
    哈根博士还对新闻记者抱怨说，他个人认为美国事前对这次发射的消息不应公开过多，但是其他人驳回了他。他说，由于公开得太多，公众已迷失了方向，看不到这次发射只是试验。
    哈根说，将尽可能快地再进行新的试验，可是他不肯说什么时候再进行试验。
    又讯：美国发射卫星失败后，引起了纽约股票的跌风，估计使纽约证券交易所各种股票牌价下跌了十二亿多元。
