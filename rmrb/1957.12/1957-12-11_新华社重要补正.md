Xinhua News Agency Important Correction

A significant correction to the Xinhua News Agency report released on the 9th, titled "Central State Organs' Rectification Has Achieved Important Political and Economic Results" (see page one of this newspaper on the 10th), concerning the Ministry of Coal Industry converting over 20,000 temporary workers into permanent employees. The original report was inaccurate. The following correction is made: The original text in the eighth paragraph, "This regulation caused many practical problems in the work and increased the contradictions between new and old workers. Now, with the approval of the leadership, it has been decided to convert these temporary workers into permanent employees," is deleted and replaced with the following content: "The Ministry of Coal Industry believes in the discussion that temporary workers must not be converted into permanent employees. This is the correct current national regulation, which must be seriously implemented. Considering the special circumstances of underground production in the coal industry, under the circumstances of heavy mining tasks and long-term labor shortages, especially considering the safety conditions underground, long-term employment of temporary underground workers cannot stabilize production, affects technical proficiency, and is not conducive to safe production underground. Therefore, with the approval of the relevant leading organs, it has been agreed to treat it as a special issue, converting a portion of temporary workers with relatively long working hours and skilled techniques into permanent employees."

Also, regarding the handling of the 65 representative offices of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in Beijing mentioned in this report, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has now decided to abolish all these offices. This is a correction.

    新华社重要补正
    本社9日发的“中央国家机关整改已取得重要的政治、经济的效果”一稿（见10日本报第一版）中，关于煤炭部将二万多临时工改为正式工的问题，报道不确切。特作如下补正：原稿中第八段“这个规定在工作中发生了许多实际问题，并且增加了新老工人的矛盾。现在经过领导的批准，已经决定将这些临时工转为正式工”一段删除，改为以下内容：“煤炭部在讨论中认为，临时工不得转为正式工，这是目前国家的正确规定，必须认真贯彻执行。由于考虑到煤炭工业井下生产的特殊情况，在采掘任务繁重而劳动力长期不足的情形下，特别是考虑到井下安全条件，长期雇用临时井下工人，不能固定生产，影响技术熟练，对井下安全生产不利。因此经有关领导机关的批准，同意当作特殊问题处理，将一部分工作时间比较长、技术熟练的临时工转为正式工。”
    又此稿中提到冶金工业部六十五个驻京办事处的处理问题，现在冶金部已决定全部撤消这些办事处，特此补正。
