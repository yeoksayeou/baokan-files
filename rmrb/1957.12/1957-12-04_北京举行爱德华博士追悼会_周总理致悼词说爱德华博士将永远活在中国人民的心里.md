Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd. A memorial service for Dr. Kotnis, the former leader of the Indian Medical Mission to China and Vice-Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, was solemnly held at the Tao Ran Ting Funeral Home in Beijing on the morning of December 3rd.

　　The hall was decorated with solemnity. In the center of the hall hung a portrait of Dr. Kotnis. Beside his urn, and inside and outside the hall, were hundreds of wreaths presented by Premier Zhou Enlai, Indian Ambassador to China R.K. Nehru, Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling, Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo, Marshal Peng Dehuai, Marshal Ye Jianying, Marshal Liu Bocheng, and relevant departments and organizations. In front of the portrait, sandalwood was burned according to Indian custom, and people came in an endless stream to pay their respects to the portrait of Dr. Kotnis, bidding farewell to this good friend of the Chinese people.

　　The memorial service began with funeral music. Premier Zhou Enlai, Ambassador Nehru, and Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling, as chief mourners, presented wreaths in front of the portrait, burned incense, and paid their respects with folded hands. Then, all those present observed three minutes of silence.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a eulogy at the memorial service. He said, "We express our condolences with grief for Dr. Kotnis, and extend our heartfelt sympathy to his family in India."

　　Premier Zhou Enlai said, "As early as 1938, Dr. Kotnis forged a deep friendship with the Chinese people. At that time, the Chinese people were engaged in a difficult war of resistance against Japan. Dr. Kotnis led the Indian Medical Mission to China, treating the wounded and rescuing the dying in the anti-Japanese base areas, and selflessly serving the vast number of soldiers and civilians. Dr. Dwarkanath Kotnis even gave his precious life. The great Indian people and their excellent son, Dr. Kotnis, provided such noble and valuable support to the Chinese people, which we will never forget. Dr. Kotnis will live forever in the hearts of the Chinese people."

　　Premier Zhou Enlai concluded by saying that the Chinese people will continue to make every effort to strengthen the great friendship between the Chinese and Indian people. This is the best way for us to commemorate Dr. Kotnis.

　　Ambassador Nehru then spoke. He said that Dr. Kotnis's spirit of sacrifice and his death in China set a great example for us to emulate, an example that further promotes the traditional friendship and cooperation between India and China. The importance of this friendship is even more significant today. Dr. Kotnis never forgot the friendship between India and China until his last breath. When we commemorate Dr. Kotnis, we should use the same love and enthusiasm to strengthen the friendship between India and China. This is not only necessary for our two countries, but also beneficial for Asia and the whole world. Ambassador Nehru said that the Chinese brothers and sisters of Dr. Kotnis did everything possible to save his life, and Premier Zhou Enlai in particular showed great concern for Dr. Kotnis's condition. He expressed his gratitude on behalf of the Indian people.

　　Before the speeches by Premier Zhou and Ambassador Nehru, Chen Hansheng, Vice-President of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, also spoke. He said that Dr. Kotnis was a very sincere and close friend of the Chinese people. People from all walks of life in our country expressed their deep condolences after learning of his death. He said, "Respected peace fighter, more people will work hard for the cause to which you have dedicated so much energy; dear friend, the flowers of Sino-Indian friendship irrigated by your blood and sweat will bloom even more brilliantly."

　　At the end of the memorial service, Chen Hansheng, Vice-President of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, personally escorted by Premier Zhou Enlai, Ambassador Nehru, Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling, and others, placed Dr. Kotnis's urn in the hearse. Dr. Kotnis's urn will be temporarily placed in the Indian Embassy in China and will then be transported back to India.
