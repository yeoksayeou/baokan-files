Xinhua News Agency, London, December 20th: A debate on foreign policy was held in the British House of Commons today. The resolutions of the NATO summit and the Conservative government's policy of abandoning British sovereignty and succumbing to the U.S. nuclear arms buildup were attacked by Labour and Conservative MPs.

    The leader of the Conservative Suez rebel group, Hinchingbrooke, to Labour cheers, said the government should postpone the establishment of U.S. missile bases in Britain. He called for a limited withdrawal of troops from East and West Germany and negotiations with the Soviet Union.

    Hinchingbrooke said, "Many agents of the United States, distributed throughout the world and in our country, are cruelly depriving us of our independence, conspiring against our empire and undermining our overseas military strongholds, and are now dragging us into the European death trap within NATO which they have created to deal with their chosen enemy."

    He said: The principle of forming alliances should be to gain greater security for oneself, but now Britain is clearly risking unilaterally protecting the security of the United States.

    He said to cheers: "I very much doubt whether, if we happened to be at war with some South American country, the United States would allow us to set up hydrogen bomb rockets off the coast of Louisiana."

    He also said that he did not think Britain had much of a future in NATO. NATO itself must be reorganized to rebuild the independence of its member states.

    Labour's Shadow Foreign Secretary Bevan said in his speech: The Paris Conference only increased the number of nuclear warheads controlled by the United States and missile bases under U.S. control in Western Europe.

    Bevan stressed that Britain should not "give up British sovereignty in order to increase the sovereignty of another country."

    He said that the situation of American bombers carrying hydrogen bombs patrolling overhead twenty-four hours a day was "a state of mobilization that is only one step away from war itself." He said the whole country was demanding an end to this state. He said, "The country also demands that if Britain provides any facilities to any foreign country in the future, these facilities must be under the full political control exercised by the British people through the British government.

    British Prime Minister Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Lloyd defended the government's attitude at the Paris Conference.

    At the end of the debate, Labour's motion of no confidence in the government's foreign policy was defeated by 289 votes to 251. The government only gained a majority of 38 votes, with five Conservative independent MPs abstaining.

### 英国工党和保守党议员  抨击政府放弃主权屈从美国

    英国工党和保守党议员
    抨击政府放弃主权屈从美国
    据新华社伦敦20日电  英国下院今天就外交政策举行辩论。北大西洋公约组织最高级会议的决议和保守党政府放弃英国主权而屈从于美国的核备战计划的政策受到工党和保守党议员的抨击。
    保守党苏伊士问题反叛集团的领袖欣琴布鲁克在工党的喝采声中说道，政府应当推迟在英国建立美国导弹基地的时间。他要求有限度地从东德和西德撤军和同苏联举行谈判。
    欣琴布鲁克说，“美国分布在全世界以及我国的许多代理人正在残酷地剥夺我们的独立，阴谋反对我们的帝国和破坏我们在海外的军事力量据点，而现在又在北大西洋公约组织内把我们拖上他们为了对付他们所选定的敌人而制造的欧洲的死亡之车。”
    他说：缔结联盟的原则应该是使自己得到更大的安全，而现在英国显然是在冒险来单方面地保护美国的安全。
    他在喝采声中说道：“我非常怀疑，如果我们碰巧同某个南美国家发生了战争，美国是否会让我们在路易斯安那沿海设置氢弹火箭。”
    他还说，他认为英国在北大西洋公约组织中并没有什么前途。北大西洋公约组织本身一定要改组以便重建它的成员国的独立。
    工党影子内阁外交大臣比万在他的演说中说：巴黎会议只是给西欧增加了由美国控制的核弹头和在美国控制下的导弹基地。
    比万强调，英国不应当“为了增加另一个国家的主权而放弃英国的主权”。
    他说，载有氢弹的美国轰炸机二十四小时都在头上巡逻这种情况是“跟战争本身只差一步的动员状态”。他说，全国都要求结束这种状态。他说，“全国还要求，如果英国再向任何外国提供任何设备的话，这些设备必须处于英国人民通过英国政府所实行的充分政治控制之下。
    英国首相麦克米伦和外交大臣劳埃德为政府在巴黎会议上采取的态度辩护。
    辩论结束时工党对政府外交政策所提出的弹劾动议以二百八十九票对二百五十一票被否决。政府只获得了三十八票的多数，有五名保守党独立派议员弃权。
