Farmer brothers, throw yourselves wholeheartedly into the upsurge of increased production!
　　The working class is your strong backing.
　　Quick Production, Quick Transport
　　Shanghai Workers Supply Large Quantities of Equipment to Farmer Brothers
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 1st: On the eve of a new upsurge in national rural production, Shanghai, which has always been closely connected with the countryside, is once again showing a busy scene of supporting agricultural production.

　　Shanghai workers, who have supported farmers with a large amount of means of production in previous rural production movements, are now working hard to manufacture tools and equipment for rural water conservancy construction. Huge water pumping machines, tiny tacks and lead wires, mud shovels and iron hoes for digging ditches, and handcarts for loading river mud are being rushed out in batches.

　　The Shanghai Machine Factory, which stands on the bank of the Huangpu River, has recently begun to focus on the production of water pumping machines for rural use. In the factory's square, large and small finished products that have been inspected are neatly arranged. Two horizontal water pumps with a three-foot three-inch outlet diameter are about to be transported to the rural areas of Hunan; these are specially designed for large irrigation areas without power sources, with an output of more than two tons per second. In the Jiangtong Machine Factory, which specializes in the production of gate opening and closing machines, workers have just manufactured a batch of small opening and closing machines for rural Jiangsu and immediately started the production of another type of opening and closing machine, which can flexibly open and close water dam gates weighing ten tons.

　　In order to adapt to the characteristics of China's vast territory and many varieties of crops, workers at the Shanghai Agricultural Machinery Factory are working hard to trial-produce five new types of agricultural machinery, ranging from small ones worn on the body to large ones powered by machines. The Fengsong No. 2 green fodder shredder, produced for the first time by Hongji Iron Factory, is now about to enter the assembly stage.

　　In the laboratories of the Shanghai working stations of the Institute of Plant Physiology and the Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, scientists are also busy for the countryside. In the Shanghai Chemical Industry Research Institute, which specializes in the research of chemical fertilizers, scientific workers have successfully trial-produced three new chemical fertilizers, namely phosphorus-nitrogen mixed fertilizer, potassium-nitrogen mixed fertilizer, and steel slag, after countless experiments. They worked with technicians from the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company and found that as long as the steelmaking operation method is slightly changed, the steel slag originally discarded by the steel plant can become a good phosphorus fertilizer. If 8,000 tons of steel slag from the Shanghai Steel Plant are used as fertilizer throughout the year, it is estimated that grain production can be increased by 100 million catties.

　　Workers on the transportation lines are also working hard to transport the means of production to the countryside as quickly as possible. When ocean-going merchant ships carrying fertilizer powder sailed into Shanghai Port to berth, dock workers immediately loaded and unloaded them, and inland river ships and trains quickly carried them away, not allowing the fertilizer powder to be delayed in the warehouse. Since the fourth quarter, more than 38,400 tons of fertilizer powder have been imported by Shanghai Port to supply the rural areas.

### 快生产　快运输　上海工人把大批器材供给农民兄弟

    农民兄弟们，全力投入增产高潮吧！
　　工人阶级是你们有力的后盾
　　快生产　快运输
　　上海工人把大批器材供给农民兄弟
    据新华社上海1日电　在全国农村新的生产高潮到来的前夜，一向同农村息息相通的上海，又呈现出支援农业生产的忙碌景象。
    曾经在历次农村生产运动中支援了农民大批生产资料的上海工人，现在又在紧张地为农村的水利建设制造工具和器材。庞大的抽水机器，细小的元钉、铅丝，开沟挖渠用的泥锹、铁锄，以及装运河泥的手推车等，正在一批批地赶制出来。
    矗立在黄浦江滨的上海机器厂，最近已开始着重生产农村用的抽水机器。工厂的广场上，齐整地排列着大大小小经过检验的成品。有两台出水口径三尺三寸大的卧式抽水机，即将运往湖南农村；这是专为没有电源的大面积灌溉区设计的，每秒钟的出水量有两吨多。在专门生产闸门启闭机的江通机器厂，工人们刚刚为江苏农村制造了一批小型启闭机以后，立刻又开始另一种启闭机的生产，这种机器能够灵便地开闭十吨重的水坝闸门。
    为了适应我国地区辽阔、农作物品种众多的特点，上海农业药械厂的工人正在紧张地试制小到挂在身上，大到用机器发动的五种新式农械。宏记铁工厂头一次生产的风送二型青饲料切碎机，现在快要进入装配阶段。
    在中国科学院植物生理研究所和昆虫研究所上海工作站的实验室里，科学家们也在为农村而忙碌。在专门研究化学肥料的上海化学工业研究院里，科学工作者经过无数次试验，已经在最近试制成功了磷氮混合肥料、钾氮混合肥料和钢渣等三种新的化学肥料。他们同上海钢铁公司技术人员一道研究，发现只要稍为改变一下炼钢的操作方法，炼钢厂原来丢弃的钢渣，就可成为一种很好的磷肥。如果全年选用上海炼钢厂八千吨钢渣当肥料，估计可以增产粮食一亿斤。
    运输线上的工人们，也在为尽速地把生产资料运往农村而紧张劳动。当载运肥田粉的远洋商船驶进上海港泊岸的时候，码头工人立刻进行装卸，内河轮船和火车又很快地载运而去，不让肥田粉在仓库耽搁停留。第四季度以来，由上海港进口供应农村的肥田粉已有三万八千四百多吨。
