The declining imperialist nation of Spain has recently urgently deployed thousands of troops to Ifni, attacking the Ifni people from land, sea, and air, because the Ifni people are demanding liberation from Spanish colonial rule and return to Morocco.

Ifni is located in southern Morocco, bordering the Atlantic Ocean to the west, covering an area of 741 square miles, with a population of approximately 40,000. This crescent-shaped area was originally part of the territory of the independent Kingdom of Morocco in North Africa.

As early as the end of the 19th century, Spain began to invade Morocco along with other colonial countries. When France forcibly signed the "Treaty of Fez" with Morocco in 1912, making Morocco a French protectorate, France then signed a spoils-sharing treaty with Spain, stipulating that the narrow northern region of Morocco and the southern Ifni region should be assigned to Spain.

Since France recognized the independence of Morocco in March 1956, the Moroccan government has declared that its current primary task is to recover the areas still occupied by Spain and achieve national unity. To this end, the Moroccan government held negotiations with the Spanish government. On April 7, 1956, the two countries jointly issued a statement announcing that the protectorate system of 1912 was no longer the basis of relations between the two countries, and recognizing the independence and full sovereignty of Morocco. However, Spain has consistently refused to return the cities of Ceuta and Melilla in northern Morocco and the Ifni region in southern Morocco to Morocco. At the end of July last year, Spain instead dispatched 1,500 troops to station in Ifni, where it established borders, attempting to occupy it permanently.

In September of this year, Morocco and Spain held negotiations on the issue of returning Ifni and other places to Morocco, but the negotiations had to be interrupted because Spain insisted on its control over Ifni. Crown Prince Moulay Hassan of Morocco once pointed out that the colonialists are clinging to this place because it is located at Morocco's gateway to the Sahara, and this region is of economic and strategic importance.

Since Morocco won its independence from France in 1956, the people of Ifni have held many parades and demonstrations demanding liberation from Spanish colonial rule and integration into Morocco. However, the Spanish colonialists, who unreasonably controlled Ifni, constantly deployed troops and have been violently suppressing the legitimate demands of the local residents. There have been many bloody conflicts between Ifni residents striving to merge with Morocco and the Spanish colonial army.

### 伊夫尼人民的起义

　　伊夫尼人民的起义
    没落的帝国主义国家西班牙最近几天内紧急增调了数千名军队到伊夫尼，从陆海空三方面向伊夫尼人民进攻，因为伊夫尼人民要求解脱西班牙殖民统治，归还到摩洛哥。
    伊夫尼位于摩洛哥南部，西濒大西洋，幅员七百四十一平方英里，居民约有四万余人。这块新月形地带，原是北非独立的王国摩洛哥的领土的一部份。
    早在十九世纪末叶，西班牙就开始和其它殖民国家一道对摩洛哥进行侵略。当法国在1912年以武力强迫摩洛哥签订“非斯条约”，使摩洛哥成为法国的保护国以后，法国跟着便同西班牙签订了一项分赃条约，规定把摩洛哥北部狭长地区和南部的伊夫尼划归西班牙。
    自1956年3月法国承认摩洛哥独立以后，摩洛哥政府即宣布其当前首要任务是收回仍为西班牙割据的地区，实现全国统一。摩洛哥政府为此同西班牙政府进行了谈判。1956年4月7日，两国共同发表了声明，宣布1912年的保护制不再是两国关系的基础，承认摩洛哥的独立和充分主权。但是，西班牙一直拒绝把摩洛哥北部的休达市、美利拉市和摩洛哥南部的伊夫尼区交还给摩洛哥。去年7月底，西班牙反而调遣了一千五百名军队驻扎在伊夫尼，在那里设立地界，企图永远占据。
    今年9月，摩洛哥和西班牙曾就伊夫尼等地归还摩洛哥问题进行了谈判，但是由于西班牙坚持对伊夫尼的控制权，谈判不得不中断。摩洛哥王储侯赛尼曾经指出，殖民主义者抓住这里不放，是因为它位于摩洛哥通向撒哈拉的大门，这个地区具有经济上和战略上的重要性。
    自1956年摩洛哥从法国手中赢得了独立以后，伊夫尼人民就曾多次游行示威，要求解脱西班牙殖民统治，并入摩洛哥。但是，无理地控制着伊夫尼的西班牙殖民者，不断调配兵力，一直用暴力镇压当地居民的正当要求。争取同摩洛哥合并的伊夫尼居民同西班牙殖民军之间已经发生过多次流血冲突。
