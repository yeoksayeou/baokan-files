According to the Vietnamese newspaper "Nhan Dan": Currently, the late rice harvest in Northern Vietnam is nearing completion. Many areas have achieved unprecedented bumper harvests, with rice growing even better than in the bumper year of 1956. Some counties in Yen Bai province, which have historically had low yields, and the Huong Son, Huong Khe, Can Loc, and Duc Tho counties in Ha Tinh province, have all significantly broken historical records for late rice this year. For example, in Duc Tho county, some fields that previously yielded only six "dan" of late rice per hectare are now yielding eighteen "dan", and some fields that previously yielded only eight "dan" per hectare are now yielding twenty-one "dan". In Thai Binh province, famous as the "granary" of the Red River Delta, some areas have achieved late rice yields as high as 55 to 58 "dan" per hectare. The late rice yields in the Vinh Linh area near the 17th parallel and in some mountainous regions of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region have also reached the bumper level of 1956.

    越南北方各地晚稻喜庆丰收
    本报讯　据越南“人民报”消息：目前，越南北方各地的晚稻即将全部收割完毕。好些地方获得空前未有的丰收，稻子长得比丰收的1956年还要好。一向产量较低的宜安省的一些县份和河静省的香山、香溪、干禄、德寿等县，今年晚稻都大大地突破了历史上最高纪录，例如德寿县有些田往年每公顷只收六担晚稻，今年却收了十八担，有些田往年每公顷只收八担，今年却收了二十一担。以红河三角洲“谷仓”闻名的太平省，有些地方每公顷晚稻产量竟高达五十五担至五十八担。十七度线附近的永灵区以及越北自治区的一些傍山地区的晚稻产量，也都达到了1956年丰产水平。
