　  Reprint of "Draft Collection of Song Huiyao"
    "Draft Collection of Song Huiyao" is the best material for studying the institutions and systems of the Song Dynasty. The Song Dynasty revised the Huiyao of the dynasty a total of ten times, but because the volumes were vast, they were not all published, and therefore gradually lost. During the Jiaqing period of the Qing Dynasty, Xu Song recorded it from the "Yongle Encyclopedia", obtaining approximately 500 volumes. In 1933, the Peking Library photoprinted the "Draft Collection of Song Huiyao" based on Xu's original, but only 200 copies were printed at the time, and it was not widely circulated. Now, in order to facilitate scholars' research, Zhonghua Book Company has recently reprinted it according to the Peking Library version, with two pages of the original book combined into one, a total of eight volumes in 16mo format, estimated to be published before the end of the year. The content of the book is divided into sections according to the nature of historical facts, including Imperial Lineage, Empresses and Consorts, Ritual and Music, Clothing, Ceremonial System, Veneration of Confucianism, Calendrical Calculations, Auspicious Omens and Anomalies, Official Posts, Elections, Taoism and Buddhism, Food and Goods, Criminal Law, Military Affairs, Regional Geography, and Foreign Peoples, etc. Approximately 70% to 80% of the materials are beyond the various chronicles of the History of the Song Dynasty, and can be said to be a deep well of the institutions and systems of the Northern and Southern Song Dynasties.

　  "Newly Revised and Corrected Dream Pool Essays"
    The book "Newly Revised and Corrected Dream Pool Essays" annotated by Hu Daojing has recently been published by Zhonghua Book Company.

Shen Kuo was a scholar with extensive knowledge and rich life experience in politics, diplomacy, and military affairs. Therefore, this notebook almost summarizes his profound insights on science and art, and reflects the various situations of the Northern Song Dynasty, which was at the forefront of national contradictions and class struggles. Scholars have always valued this cultural heritage in terms of academic value and historical materials. (Qian Yang)
    The works of Yu Zhengxie, a great scholar of the Qing Dynasty

The scope of argumentation of these two books includes classics, history, geography, philosophers, medical theory, astronomy, Buddhist scriptures, Taoist canons, as well as ancient artifacts, systems, and social customs, with extensive citations and careful textual research. These two books will soon be published by the Commercial Press.

　  重印“宋会要辑稿”
    “宋会要辑稿”是研究宋代章典制度的最好材料。宋代修本朝会要前后共十次，但是因为卷帙浩繁，没有全部刊行，所以陆续的遭到散失。清嘉庆年间，徐松从“永乐大典”中录出，约得五百卷。1933年北京图书馆曾就徐氏原本影印成“宋会要辑稿”，但是当时仅印了二百册，流传不广。现在为了学者们研究方便起见，中华书局最近根据北京图书馆本以原书两页合一面重印，共十六开本八册，估计年底前可出版。该书内容就史实性质分为帝系、后妃、礼乐、舆服、仪制、崇儒、运历、瑞异、职官、选举、道释、食货、刑法、兵、方域、蕃夷等部分，约有十分之七八的材料，超出于宋史诸志以外，可以说是两宋章典制度的渊海。　（于）
