    Standing Up
    By our special correspondent Xu Chi
    In January 1953, I came to Anshan and walked onto the construction sites of the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel.
    The large rolling mill was under construction in winter. In the alleyways built with straw mats, civil engineering workers pushed small iron carts, running in formation, pouring the heated concrete into various foundations.
    At that time, the factory buildings were like metal nets spread out in the high sky. Riveters rode on steel beams, using a trumpet-shaped funnel to receive the red-hot rivets thrown up from below. Fitters were dealing with tens of thousands of anchor bolts. The construction site was chaotic and tense, like thousands of troops attacking a position. At the center of the position, on the foundation of the rolling mill, a red flag fluttered.
    At that time, the heating furnace of the seamless steel pipe plant was being bricked, with furnace builders drilling around inside. I saw the electric wires in the main electrical room, a myriad of them, and also saw many machines never seen or heard of, and countless roller conveyors, imagining the magical scenery of the factory's mechanization and automation.
    The other item of the three major projects, the No. 7 blast furnace, was still a pile of scrap iron at that time. Looking up from its bottom, it was as deep as looking up at the dome of the Temple of Heaven in the Temple of Prayer for Good Harvests. The No. 6 blast furnace was filled with scrap iron, like two solid iron mountains. The Nos. 9 and 5 blast furnaces were leaning to one side. At that time, the No. 8 blast furnace was nearing completion. I once climbed to the top of the furnace and looked out over the entire Anshan Iron and Steel Company.
    This was a company that had been paralyzed for several years, with most of its chimneys not smoking. It was beginning to awaken, to move, and to try to stand up.
    But that was when the Five-Year Plan had just been announced. The builders of the three major projects all admitted that they didn't yet know how to do such large projects. Could we industrialize? Some people were very confident. Others felt茫然, waiting to see developments, to see the facts...
    In December 1957, I came to Anshan Iron and Steel again. Re-visiting the old place, the mood was different. Five years had passed. The three major projects were long completed. Anshan Iron and Steel had also been built up: the exciting fact that could be seen at first glance. Facts speak loudest.
    I couldn't wait to drive to the blast furnace company, and as soon as I entered, I saw Manager Bai and Assistant Wang Wentao. Manager Bai was tall, standing in front of you like a blast furnace. Wang Wentao was still the same agile, resolute, and energetic person as five years ago. I still remember those unforgettable nights when he took me to see the No. 8 blast furnace being baked.
    At that time, he was full of confidence. Now his tone is even more different.
    "You see, all nine big blast furnaces are smoking," he said, "We also went to Benxi to renovate two big blast furnaces. In the past few years, we could only repair one a year. In the past two years, we can repair two a year."
    "Next year, we will be unemployed," Manager Bai said, jokingly, "All that is left of the project are two boilers. We will be unemployed soon."
    Five years ago, I met cadres like him who were transferred from the prefectural and county party committees to industry and were feeling苦闷because they couldn't get into it and couldn't pick it up. But now he was complaining that there was no work to do. I said, "Go to Wuhan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel!"
    Wang Wentao said, "We have already sent a team to Wuhan Iron and Steel. But our strength can also be divided to work on the blast furnaces of two iron and steel joint enterprises, not counting the support for Wuhan Iron and Steel."
    "Hold on," I said, "These years you have been renovating projects, not building new ones!"
    "No, this year's No. 3 blast furnace is newly built. The old furnace was completely dismantled and built from the bottom to the top. Construction started in February and production started in July, wasn't that fast? Because we adopted the latest welding blast furnace technology, it's fast and saves money, and we use Г AMMA rays to check it, so the quality is good..."
    Wang Wentao spoke eloquently, talking about how they have a whole set of processes for installing new automated blast furnaces, and taking out a process card from his pocket to show me.
    This means that they can now construct according to the process card. The technical strength has grown to such an extent, which was completely unexpected.
    But Manager Bai also said: "What has grown is not only the construction strength. The characteristic of the No. 3 blast furnace is that it is completely domestic equipment. The drawings are from the Anshan Iron and Steel Design Institute, and the equipment is self-made by the Mechanical General Plant and the Metal Structure Company."
    "But, what about the unemployment problem?" I retorted.
    Manager Bai laughed, "Exceeding England in fifteen years! Not only will we not be unemployed, but we will also recruit soldiers and buy horses, and step up training. Wuhan, Baotou... large, medium and small blast furnaces, there is work everywhere!"
    Wang Wentao also led me to the site, walked onto the No. 3 blast furnace, and praised its beautiful welded furnace shell. Standing on the blast furnace of the steel plant, it felt like being in a deep mountain valley. All around were towering black peaks, and the sun could not shine in. At this time, several blast furnaces were discharging iron at the same time, flowing down golden, splashing springs, radiating light.
    The next day, I ran to Dagushan.
    In early 1953, I visited this mine. At that time, ore raw materials were transported by train to the Anshan Iron and Steel ore dressing plant.
    Now, layers of factory buildings have been built at the foot of the once desolate mountain. Director Chen of the Dagushan Ore Dressing Plant Comprehensive Construction Site asked a dispatcher (who used to be at the seamless construction site) to take me to see it.
    I really wanted to see this factory because I had seen the first ore dressing five years ago and got a terrible impression. At that time, the first ore dressing was equipment left by Japanese imperialism. Walking in the factory building, it descended layer by layer. The factory building was dark, and the dust was as thick as fog. There were sewage ditches everywhere, flowing into sewage pools. It gradually felt like the eighteenth level of hell. At that time, Anshan Iron and Steel had many equipment and factories left over from the capitalist world, which gave people an unpleasant impression.
    Now, the scene of the Dagushan Ore Dressing Plant is completely different. The factory buildings are exceptionally spacious, very bright, with automated equipment, controlled by lights and signals, and everything is well organized.
    Hong Zhengfang, the dispatcher, proudly told me:
    "The ore dressing plant is in its third phase of construction, and the first and second phases have already been put into production. The third phase is already in trial operation. The first and second phases were all ordered from abroad. During the second phase of construction, there were also three Soviet experts in mechanical installation, electrical installation, and pipelines to guide us. But all the equipment in the third phase is self-made. During construction, we did it ourselves, and the experts only came to inspect it when the time came."
    As we spoke, we arrived at the ball mill. Several people were squatting near the bearing, observing the test run of this heavy machine. The dispatcher glanced at it and said, "The bearing is not very good. In the past, we would have to find Soviet experts again. Now we are looking for Comrade Shen from the bearing group. He followed the bearing experts for two years. We can solve this kind of problem ourselves."
    This dispatcher was wearing a leather coat, with his hands in front of his chest. An ordinary person suddenly said extraordinary things:
    "From design, equipment, construction, to production, we can do it now. We don't have to be扶一步,走一步 like before. Anshan Iron and Steel has stood up, and our industry has stood up." As he said this, he did not raise his voice, but said it quite lightly, with only a slight excitement, as if he was just saying something not very rare, although he was still very happy to say it.
    But this is indeed a major historical fact. Five years, only five years, our industry has stood up.
    I followed him to the second steelmaking plant, the newly built coke oven, the Mechanical General Plant, etc. Everywhere was the same situation. I told Manager Zhao, the person in charge of Anshan Metallurgical Construction General Company, what the dispatcher said, and he also agreed with this view. He was still the same as five years ago, not tall, with a slightly dark complexion. But he completed the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel in one go. He will complete the entire iron and steel joint enterprise project. Now, the amount of work is much more, but he is not as busy and nervous as before. The comprehensive construction sites below all have commanders who can fight independently.
    This morning, I went to the site with him for a walk. We arrived at the second medium plate factory. Entering the factory building, he explained: "Two heating furnaces, then the roller conveyor, then the rolling mill, until the shearing machine," then smiled, "All rolling mills are about the same. Starting from large-scale, seamless, we made one, then another. After making more, it naturally becomes less difficult. This factory is also self-designed and self-made equipment. As soon as the equipment arrives, it is installed, and the experience of 'pre-installation' of large-scale and seamless is no longer used. At that time, it was for learning, and now we have learned it."
    Manager Zhao told me that there are a total of forty-eight major construction projects in Anshan Iron and Steel. Thirty-seven of them will be completed by the end of the year. This will complete the construction of the first five-year plan. But the great construction is still in progress.
    He also wanted to take me to see a construction site.
    In the car, I asked: What are the signs that our industry can stand up? He said that he had not considered such a question. But perhaps it can be said that one of the signs is whether we can self-make heavy machinery and precision machinery, and the main thing is whether we can self-make heavy machinery. Then, blast furnaces, open hearth furnaces, coke ovens, rolling mills, etc., we can all self-make them now. Yes, our industry can be said to have stood up.
    Just as he was saying this, the car made a turn. I saw a great factory emerging in front of me and exclaimed, "Such a long factory building!"
    The manager smiled. "Still under construction. I'll tell you how long it will be in a moment."
    We crawled into a tunnel and came out in the middle of two factory buildings. Half of it was already in production, with the furnace fire red. Half of it was in test operation, with large and small units rumbling, and the responsible engineer waving a small green flag.
    The longest factory building I have seen is the general assembly workshop of the First Automobile Factory. But this factory building is much longer. It took us half a day to finish seeing it.
    But another factory appeared in front of us. That was a construction site, under construction in winter. After leaving the factory building, we walked onto the scaffolding of the construction site. In a moment, we were on the high-altitude platform.
    We could no longer see the alleyways built with straw mats. Now, instead of the previous warm shed method, we use the heat storage method and the electric heating method. Manager Zhao pointed out to me various insulation templates, and also told me about this foundation and that foundation. We walked from the platform to another foundation.
    After passing there, we walked from the platform scaffolding again, far away from the original factory. At the end of the platform scaffolding, the manager stretched out his arm and pointed to the vast wilderness, where, where, at the excavator (hundreds of meters away) is the end of this factory building, from there, another factory building is connected down, all the way to that small house with smoke far away... All of this can be built by the end of next year.
    What a great construction site!
    When Manager Zhao pointed out like this, I remembered Manager Wang of Wuhan Iron and Steel (also from Anshan Iron and Steel) who had also pointed and划脚 us at the high point of the thermal power station, talking about the layout of the Wuhan Iron and Steel plant area. I told this to Manager Zhao, and he said:
    "Yes, Wuhan Iron and Steel is very big!"
    Wuhan Iron and Steel is very big, but judging from the situation in Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel will also be built very quickly.
    The fact is this: Anshan Iron and Steel has been built into one of the world's greatest iron and steel joint enterprises. Anshan Iron and Steel has stood up. Our industry, after such five years, can also be said to have stood up. What happens after standing up? After standing up, naturally, we take big strides forward.
    Recalling the beginning of the first five-year plan now, it seems like only yesterday, but in the blink of an eye, it has been successfully completed, and we have arrived at the beginning of the second five-year plan. Time flies like an arrow, this is true. This is a good saying. This saying means that we have a preliminary foundation for building a strong socialist country.

    站起来了
    本报特约记者　徐迟
    1953年1月，我曾来到鞍山，走上鞍钢的三大工程的建设工地。
    大型轧钢厂在冬季施工。一条条用草席搭起的巷道中，土建工人推着小铁车，列队飞跑，把车里的加热混凝土浇灌到各种各样的基础中去。
    那时，厂房像张开在高空中的金属网。铆工骑在钢梁上。用一个喇叭筒接纳底下抛上来的火红的铆钉。钳工们在和千万只地脚螺丝打交道。工地零乱、紧张，像千军万马在攻打阵地。阵地中心的轧钢机基础上，一面红旗飘扬。
    那时，无缝钢管厂的加热炉正在砌砖，筑炉工在里面钻来钻去。我看见主电室里的电线，千头万绪，还看见许多见所未见、闻所未闻的机器和无数的辊道，缅想着这座工厂的机械化自动化的神奇的风光。
    三大工程的另外一项，七高炉，当时还是一堆烂铁。从它的炉底仰望，好像在祈年殿里仰望天坛的圆顶一样深邃。六高炉炉膛中盛载着满满的废铁，像两座实心的铁山。九、五高炉，东倒西歪。那时，八高炉已接近完工。我曾爬上炉顶，眺望整个鞍山钢铁公司。
    这是一个瘫痪了几年的公司，大半烟囱未冒烟。它开始在苏醒，在动弹，在试图站起来。
    但那是在五年计划刚刚宣布的时候。三大工程的建设家全都承认，他们还不会干这样大的工程。我们能不能工业化？有的人信心很高。有的人却感到茫然，要等着看发展，看事实……
    1957年12月，我又来到了鞍钢。旧地重游，心情却不同。五年已经过去了。三大工程早完了。鞍钢也已经建设起来：第一眼就能看出这使人激动的事实。事实是最有发言权的。
    我急不及待地驰车去高炉公司，一进门就看见了白经理和助理王文涛。白经理个儿大，站在你面前，就像一座高炉。王文涛却还是五年前那副灵巧、坚决和精力弥漫的样子。我还记得那些个难忘的夜晚，他带着我去看八高炉烘炉。
    当时的他就满怀信心。现在的口气更不一样。
    “你看，九座大高炉都冒烟了”，他说，“我们还到本溪去改建了两座大高炉。前几年，一年只能修一座。这两年，一年能修两座。”
    “明年，我们要失业了，”白经理说，开玩笑似的，“全部工程只剩有两座锅炉。我们马上就要失业了。”
    五年前，我遇到过他这样的从地委县委会转工业的干部正为钻不进去和拿不起来感到苦闷。而他现在却在埋怨没有活儿干了。我说，“到武钢，包钢去！”
    王文涛说，“我们已经送出一支队伍到武钢去了。但是，我们的力量还可以分开来搞两个钢铁联合企业的高炉，支援武钢的不算。”
    “且慢，”我说，“这些年你们都是改建工程，并不是新建！”
    “不然，今年的三高炉就是新建性质。旧炉子拆光了，从底下一直筑到顶。2月开工，7月生产，快不快？因为我们采用了最新式的焊接高炉的技术，又快又省钱，用Г AMMA射线进行检查，质量又好……”
    王文涛滔滔不绝的讲着，讲他们安装新型自动化高炉有一整套的工艺过程，说着从衣兜里掏出一本工艺卡给我看。
    这是说，他们现在能按照工艺卡施工。技术力量已经成长到了这样的程度，这是完全没有想到的。
    但是，白经理又说：“成长的不仅是施工力量。三高炉的特点，完全是国产设备。鞍钢设计院的图纸，机械总厂和金属结构公司自制的设备。”
    “可是，失业问题怎末办？”我顶他一句。
    白经理笑了，“十五年超过英国！非但不会失业，还要招兵买马，加紧训练。武汉，包头……大中小型高炉，到处都有活儿！”
    王文涛又带领了我去现场，走上三高炉，看焊接炉缸，赞扬它的美观。站立在炼铁厂的高炉上，好像置身在深山幽谷里。四面八方都是黑色的高耸的山峰，太阳都照不进来似的。这时，有几座高炉同时在出铁，流下金色的飞溅的泉水，光芒四射。
    第二天，我跑到大孤山。
    1953年初，我去看过这座矿山，那时矿石原料用火车往鞍钢的选矿厂运。
    现在，重重叠叠的厂房已建立在当年荒凉无比的山脚。大孤山选矿厂综合工地的陈主任让一个调度员（当年是在无缝工地的）带领我去看。
    我很想看一看这个厂是由于我看过五年前的一选矿，得到了可怕的印象。当时的一选矿是日本帝国主义留下的设备。在厂房中走，一层层下降。厂房很暗，尘土如雾之浓。到处污水沟，汇入污水池。渐渐觉得它像十八层地狱。当时鞍钢有许多从资本主义世界里残留下来的设备和厂子，给人不愉快的印象。
    现在，大孤山选矿厂的景象完全不同了。厂房异常宽敞，十分光亮，自动化的设备，灯火信号操纵，一切井然有序。
    洪正芳，那个调度员，很骄傲的告诉我：
    “选矿厂三期施工，第一、二期早已投入生产。第三期已经在试车。一二期全部是国外定货。二期施工时，还有机装、电装和管道三位苏联专家来指导。但是三期的全部设备是自制的。施工时，我们自己干，专家只是到时候来检查。”
    说话间，我们来到了球磨机旁边。有几个人蹲在轴承的地方观察这台重型机器的试运转。调度员瞧了一下说，“轴承不太好。要在以前，又要找苏联专家了。现在找的是轴承组那个姓沈的同志。他跟了轴承专家两年。这一类的问题，我们都能自己解决了。”
    这个调度员披着一件皮大衣，手插在胸前，一个平常的人突然说出了不平常的话来：
    “从设计，设备，施工，到生产，我们现在都行了。再不用像前些时候的扶一步，走一步了。鞍钢已经站起来了，我们的工业已经站起来了。”他说着，并没有提高他的声音，说得相当轻描淡写，只微有激动，好像他只是说了一桩并不怎末希罕，虽然他还是很高兴说的一桩事。
    但是，这确实是一个重大的历史事实。五年，仅仅五年，我们的工业已经站起来了。
    跟着我到了第二炼钢厂，新建的焦炉，机械总厂等处。到处都是同样的情况。我把调度员的话告诉了鞍山冶金建筑总公司的负责人、赵经理，他也同意这个看法。他还是五年前的模样，个子不高，面容微黑。可是，他把鞍钢的建设一口气干下来了。他将干完一整个钢铁联合企业的工程。现在，工程量是多得多，但他不像先前的又忙又紧张了。下面的综合工地都有能独立作战的指挥员。
    这个早晨，我跟他到现场去走一圈。我们到了第二中板厂。进了厂房，他作说明：“两个加热炉，然后是辊道，然后是轧钢机，直到剪断机，”于是笑了，“所有的轧钢厂都差不多。从大型，无缝开始，我们做了一个，又一个。做得多了，自然就不困难了。这个厂也是自己设计，自己制造的设备。设备一来就安装，再不采用当年大型、无缝的‘预安装’的经验。那时为了学习，现在已经学会了。”
    赵经理告诉我，鞍钢建设的大项目共四十八项。年底前完成三十七项。这便完成了第一个五年计划的建设。但伟大的建设仍然在进行中。
    他还要带领我去看一个工地。
    在车里，我发问：什么是我们的工业能够站起来的标志？他说他没有考虑过这样的问题。但也许可以说，标志之一是能否自制重型机器和精密机器，更主要的在于能否自制重型机器。那末，高炉，平炉，焦炉，轧钢机等等，我们已经都能自制了。是的，我们的工业可以说已经站起来了。
    正说着，汽车一拐弯。我看见前面涌现一个伟大的厂子，叫起来，“这末长的厂房！”
    经理微笑。“还在建设中。一忽儿我告诉你它将有多长。”
    我们钻进一条地道，出来是在两个厂房建筑的中间。那半边已经在生产，炉火通红。这半边正在试车，大小机组正在隆隆转动，负责的工程师手拿小绿旗儿挥动。
    我所看到的最长的厂房是第一汽车厂的总装配车间。但这个厂房长得多多了。我们走了半天才把它看完。
    但是前面又出现了另一个厂。那是一个工地，正在冬季施工。走出了厂房，我们走上工地的跳板。一忽儿我们已在高空平台上。
    我们却看不到一条条用草席搭起的巷道了。现在不用以前的那个暖棚法，而用蓄热法电热法。赵经理指给我看各种保温模板，还告诉我这个基础，那个基础的。我们从平台上走过去，又到了另外的基础。
    过了那里，又从平台跳板上走过去，离原来的那个厂子已很远了。到了平台的跳板的尽头，经理伸出手臂，向辽阔的原野指去，那儿，那儿，在挖土机那儿（几百公尺之外）是这个厂房的尽头，从那里，另有个厂房连着下去，一直到远远的冒气的那个小屋那儿……明年年底，这一切都可以建成了。
    何等伟大的一个工地呵！
    赵经理这样指指点点的时候，我想起武钢的王经理（也是从鞍钢去的）也曾经在热电站的高处给我们指手划脚的讲武钢的厂区的布置。我把这告诉了赵经理，他说：
    “是呵，武钢很大！”
    武钢很大，但从鞍钢的情况来看，武钢也将很快很快的建成的。
    事实就是这样：鞍钢已经建设成为世界最伟大的钢铁联合企业之一。鞍钢已经站起来了。我们的工业，经过这样的五年，也可以说，已经站起来了。站起来之后怎样？站起来之后，自然是大步迈进。
    如今回忆第一个五年计划的开始，仿佛还是昨日之事，但一转眼间，它已经胜利完成了，来到了第二个五年计划的更始之时。光阴如箭，这话不假。这话可说得好。这话就是说，我们已经有了建成为一个社会主义强国的初步基础了。
