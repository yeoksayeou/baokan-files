How to Be a Socialist Physicist?
A Debate Among Students of the Physics Department of Nankai University

(Reported by our newspaper) Recently, students in many departments and classes of Nankai University have launched a major debate on the issue of "Redness and Expertise."

Second-year students of the Physics Department first launched a debate on what constitutes "Redness." Some people said: Supporting socialism is "Redness," and they further extrapolated: The vast majority of today's college students are already "Red." Their reasoning is: "Only a small number of rightists oppose socialism; we all support socialism!" Other students proposed: The standard of "Redness" is: not only to have a "firm working-class stand, a communist worldview, and noble morality, but also to be proficient in Marxism-Leninism," to be able to "correctly and keenly analyze events happening at home and abroad and in the surrounding life," and to "foresee the development of things." However, after these students put forward such a standard, they quickly added that most people "will never reach" such a standard, and it is only our "goal to strive for." Both of these opinions were refuted by the majority of students. They believe that the so-called "Redness" is to be a working-class intellectual, and its most important symbol is "having a firm working-class stand" and "serving the people wholeheartedly." As long as we resolutely transform ourselves, we will gradually become a firm fighter in the army of working-class intellectuals. The idea that one can never achieve "Redness" in a lifetime actually means being unwilling to demand oneself with working-class ideology.

Some students proposed: Studying physics is different from studying social sciences; their nature and objects are different—social scientists want to transform people, while natural scientists want to transform nature, so the standards of Redness should also be different. This view was refuted. Everyone pointed out that the so-called "more expertise, less Redness" is actually a disguised way of saying "only expertise, no Redness." Because "more expertise" to what extent, and "less Redness" to what extent? There is no standard or limit to this. "Only expertise, no Redness" and "more expertise, less Redness" are essentially wanting "expertise" and not "Redness." They believe: "The standard of 'Redness' is the same for college students of all departments: 'Can it be said that physicists can not firmly stand on the working-class position, and not firmly take the socialist road?'" These students believe that it is inappropriate to separate the study of physics from the study of other sciences.

Someone said: "First expertise, then Redness" is not good, I don't adopt it, but "first expertise, then Redness" is possible. These people's argument is: Our country has some old bourgeois experts who have been reformed. These views were immediately opposed by some students, who believed that this view violates historical conditions. The vast majority of students affirmed that in our society, "first expertise, then Redness" is unfeasible, and "both Red and expert" is the best.

### 怎样做社会主义的物理学家？  南开大学物理系学生在辩论中

    怎样做社会主义的物理学家？
    南开大学物理系学生在辩论中
    本报讯　南开大学的许多系和班的学生，最近都开展了“红与专”问题的大辩论。
    物理系二年级学生首先展开了什么叫做“红”的辩论。有些人说：拥护社会主义就是“红”，他们还进一步引伸：今天的大学生绝大部分都已经“红”了。他们的理由是：“反对社会主义的只是少数右派分子，我们都拥护社会主义！”另外一些同学提出：“红”的标准是：不但要有“坚定的工人阶级立场、共产主义人生观和高尚的道德，而且要精通马克思列宁主义”，能“正确、敏锐地分析国内外和周围生活中发生的事件”，并“预见事物的发展”。但是这些同学提出了这样的标准后，就赶快补充说：这样的标准大多数人“永远达不到”，它只是我们的“奋斗目标”。这两种意见都受到了大多数同学的反驳。他们认为，所谓“红”就是做工人阶级的知识分子，而它的最主要标志就是“有坚定的工人阶级立场”，“全心全意为人民服务”。只要我们坚决改造自己，我们一定会逐步成为工人阶级知识分子大军中的一个坚定战士。那种认为一辈子也达不到“红”的说法实际上是不愿意以工人阶级思想来要求自己。
    有的同学提出：学物理不同于学社会科学的，它们的性质和对象都不同——社会科学家要改造人，而自然科学家要改造自然，因此红的标准也就应该有所不同。这样观点受到了反驳。大家指出，所谓“多专少红”实际上是“只专不红”的变相提法。因为“多专”究竟多到什么程度，“少红”又少到什么程度？这里面没个标准也没个界限。“只专不红”和“多专少红”本质上都是要“专”不要“红”。他们认为：“红”的标准对于无论是哪系的大学生都是一样的：“难道可以说物理学家就可以不坚决站稳工人阶级立场，不坚定地走社会主义道路么？”这些同学认为把学物理的跟学其它科学的割裂开来是不恰当的。
    有人说：“先专后红”不好，我不采取，但“先专后红”是可能的。这些人的论据是：我国有已被改造了的一些旧的资产阶级专家。这些论点立即受到一些同学的反对，认为这种观点是违反历史条件的。绝大多数同学肯定，在我们这个社会里，“先专后红”是行不通的，“又红又专”是最好的。
