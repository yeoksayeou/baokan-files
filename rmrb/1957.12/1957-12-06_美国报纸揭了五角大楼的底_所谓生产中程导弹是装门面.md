Xinhua News Agency, December 5th. TASS, New York, December 3rd: New York "Daily News" military editor, Glenn, reported from Washington that Defense Secretary McElroy stated in a Congressional committee on November 27th that he had ordered the "immediate" manufacture of "Jupiter" and "Thor" intermediate-range ballistic missiles for the armed forces; this statement is either "self-deception or a clumsy trick." Glenn said that the facts prove that the "Thor" intermediate-range missile is still being tested by "Douglas Aircraft Company," and generally only two missiles can be manufactured per month.

Glenn said that the situation of the "Jupiter" missile manufactured by the army at the Redstone Arsenal in Alabama by a group of German scientists led by Dr. Wernher von Braun is "slightly better, but there is not much hope either."

    美国报纸揭了五角大楼的底
　　所谓生产中程导弹是装门面
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社纽约3日讯：纽约“每日新闻”军事编辑格林从华盛顿报道说：国防部长麦克艾罗伊11月27日在国会委员会中声明说，他已经下令“立刻”为武装部队制造“丘辟特”式和“雷神”式中程弹道导弹；这种说法不是“自欺欺人、就是玩弄拙劣的手法”。格林说，事实证明：“雷神”式中程导弹还在由“道格拉斯飞机公司”试制中，并且一般每月只能制造两枚。
    格林说，以韦尔纳·布劳恩博士为首的一批德国科学家在亚拉巴马州红石兵工厂为陆军制造的“丘辟特”式导弹的情况“稍微好一点，但是希望也不大”。
