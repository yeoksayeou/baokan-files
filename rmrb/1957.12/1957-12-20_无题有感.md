　　Thoughts on a Titleless Piece
　　Zhong Huai
　　Being "ruthless" towards rightists is easy to do, because rightists are our enemies. But being "ruthless" towards one's own shortcomings and mistakes is not so easy, because shortcomings and mistakes, though not good, are, after all, "one's own"!

　　Only the truly courageous can be "ruthless" to themselves. This courage does not come from anything else, but from selflessness.

　　A relatively responsible Party cadre in a unit in Shanghai, facing criticism from the masses during the rectification campaign, actually said: "Those who have made criticisms of me in previous movements have not been good people!" With "I" as the center, anyone who makes criticisms of "me" is not a good person. How can we hope that such a person, who cannot forget "I," will bravely invite fire upon himself and ruthlessly correct "my" shortcomings and mistakes?

　　In Taiyuan, there was a Communist Party member engaged in theoretical propaganda work. When his wife, who worked in a hydro-electric installation company, was approved by the leadership to go to the countryside, instead of encouraging her to happily embark on the labor front, he ran to the company in a menacing manner and questioned: "What are the reasons for your approval?" He even threatened: "We who do theoretical work receive special care from the higher authorities..."

　　May I ask this "theoretical worker": Is the "special care" the higher authorities give you a detachment of theory from practice?

    对右派要“狠”，是容易做到的，因为右派是我们的敌人。对自己的缺点和错误要“狠”，就不那么容易了，因为缺点和错误虽说不好，毕竟是“自己的”呵！
    唯大勇者才能做到对自己的“狠”。这勇气不是来自别的，而是来自无私。
    上海某单位一个比较负责的党员干部，在整改中面对着群众的批评，竟说：“历次运动中对我提意见的人都不是好人！”以“我”为中心，凡对“我”提意见的就不是好人。像这样不能忘“我”的人，怎能希望他勇敢地引火烧身，狠狠地改掉“我”的缺点和错误呢？
    太原有一个从事理论宣传工作的共产党员，当着他的在水电安装公司工作的妻子被领导批准下乡的时候，不但不去鼓励她愉快地走上劳动战线，反而跑到公司里气势凶凶地质问：“你们是根据什么理由批准的？”甚至威胁说：“我们搞理论工作的，上级有特殊照顾……”。
    敢问这位“搞理论工作的”：上级对于你们的“特殊照顾”，难道是理论和实践的脱节？
