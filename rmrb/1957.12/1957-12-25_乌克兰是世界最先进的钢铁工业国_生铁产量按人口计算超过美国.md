Ukraine is the World's Most Advanced Steel Industrial Nation
	Pig Iron Production Per Capita Exceeds the United States
	(Our Moscow Dispatch, December 24th) Calculated on a per capita basis, the Ukrainian Republic's production of pig iron already exceeds that of the United States, and its steel production already exceeds that of the United Kingdom, France, and West Germany. This once again proves the superiority of the socialist system. In 1956, Ukraine's pig iron production reached 424 kilograms per capita, which is 21 kilograms more than the United States, 73 kilograms more than West Germany, 151 kilograms more than France, and 153 kilograms more than the United Kingdom, ranking first in the world. Steel production per capita was 24 kilograms more than West Germany, 59 kilograms more than the United Kingdom, and 161 kilograms more than France, second only to the United States and ranking second in the world.
	Forty years ago, the steel production of capitalist countries in Western Europe such as Britain and France was much more developed than that of the Ukrainian Republic. Before the October Revolution, there were 32 blast furnaces in Ukraine, with an average volume of 420 cubic meters per furnace. However, 80% of the pig iron was produced with investment from foreign capitalists. After the victory of the October Revolution, Ukraine, like other republics of the Union, began large-scale economic construction. By 1940, 53 blast furnaces had been built in Ukraine, with an average volume of 688 cubic meters per furnace. The number of open-hearth furnaces also increased from 64 in 1913 to 135. During the Second World War, most of these open-hearth furnaces and blast furnaces were destroyed. After the war, Ukraine began a huge economic recovery and construction. By the end of 1956, 33 new giant blast furnaces and 88 open-hearth furnaces had been built, making it one of the most advanced industrialized countries in the world. Its pig iron production accounts for 48% of the total production of the entire Soviet Union, steel accounts for 37.7%, and steel products account for 38.8%.
	Currently, Ukraine's steel industry and other industrial sectors are continuing to develop at a rapid pace.
	Due to the mining of new iron ore mines in Krivoy Rog and Kerch, Ukraine's annual pig iron production will reach 24 million tons, and its annual steel production will reach 25 million tons during the Sixth Five-Year Plan.
	Coal in Ukraine has always occupied an important position in the total coal production of the Soviet Union. In the future, in addition to continuing to expand the mining of the Donbass coalfield, the Lviv-Volyn coalfield will be developed. This coalfield will produce 5 million tons of coal annually in three years. The coalfields in Kirovograd and Chernihiv Oblasts are also being rapidly developed, and 13.5 million tons of coal will be produced here annually by 1960. Therefore, by the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, Ukraine's annual coal production will reach 190 million tons.
	High-quality oil is also very abundant in Ukraine, and new oil wells are constantly being discovered. By 1960, oil production will be doubled compared to 1955.

### 乌克兰是世界最先进的钢铁工业国  生铁产量按人口计算超过美国

    乌克兰是世界最先进的钢铁工业国
    生铁产量按人口计算超过美国
    本报莫斯科24日电　按人口平均计算，乌克兰共和国生铁的产量已超过美国，钢的产量已超过英国、法国、西德。这又一次证明了社会主义制度的优越性。1956年乌克兰生铁的产量，按人口平均计算已达四百二十四公斤，即比美国多二十一公斤，比西德多七十三公斤，比法国多一百五十一公斤，比英国多一百五十三公斤，而居世界第一位。钢的产量按人口平均计算比西德多二十四公斤，比英国多五十九公斤，比法国多一百六十一公斤，仅次于美国而占世界第二位。
    四十年前，西欧的英法等资本主义国家的钢铁生产，都比乌克兰共和国发达得多。十月革命前，乌克兰境内建有三十二座高炉，每座高炉的平均容积为四百二十立方公尺。但其中80％的生铁是由外国资本家投资生产的。十月革命胜利后，乌克兰和其他加盟共和国一样，开始了大规模的经济建设。到1940年在乌克兰建起了五十三座高炉，每座高炉的平均容积为六百八十八立方公尺。平炉也由1913年的六十四座增为一百三十五座。第二次世界大战时期，这些平炉和高炉绝大部分遭到了破坏。战后，乌克兰开始了巨大的经济恢复和建设。到1956年底，新建起三十三座巨型高炉、八十八座平炉，跃为世界上最先进的工业化国家之一。它的生铁的产量占全苏整个生产的48％，钢占37.7％，钢材占38.8％。
    目前，乌克兰的钢铁工业和其他工业部门正以飞快速度继续发展。
    由于克里沃洛什和凯尔契两地新铁矿的开采，乌克兰在第六个五年计划内生铁的年产量就能达到二千四百万吨，钢的年产量将达二千五百万吨。
    乌克兰的煤在整个苏联煤产量中一直占重要地位。今后除了继续扩大开采顿巴斯煤田外，将开发里沃夫—沃立斯基煤田。这个煤田在三年后每年可产煤五百万吨。基洛夫格勒和契尔尼高夫州的煤田也在迅速开采中，到1960年这里每年可产煤一千三百五十万吨。因此，到第六个五年计划结束时，乌克兰煤的年产量可达一亿九千万吨。
    质量优良的石油在乌克兰蕴藏也非常丰富，新的油井不断发现。到1960年石油产量将比1955年增加两倍。
