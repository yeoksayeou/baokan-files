Explanation on the Draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme
Chinese Writing Reform Committee

I. Why is it necessary to formulate and implement a Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme?

Formulating and implementing a Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is one of the main tasks of the current writing reform work.

The purpose of the current writing reform work is to facilitate people's learning and use of Chinese characters, gradually unify the pronunciation of Chinese characters and unify the Han nationality language, so that our language and writing can be better mastered by the people and better serve our socialist construction, rather than abolishing Chinese characters. As for the question of whether Chinese characters need and are suitable for fundamental reform, that is, reforming Chinese characters into phonetic writing, it is a matter of a different nature and does not fall within the scope of the current writing reform. It should not be confused with the task of the current writing reform.

The tasks of the current writing reform are: (1) to simplify Chinese characters to facilitate the teaching and application of Chinese characters; (2) to promote Mandarin Chinese with Beijing pronunciation as the standard to gradually unify the Han nationality language; (3) to formulate and implement a Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme to annotate Chinese characters, help teach Chinese characters, unify pronunciation, and promote Mandarin Chinese.

Chinese characters do not show pronunciation on the surface (that is, the pronunciation of phonetic characters cannot be accurately judged from the surface), and they must be memorized one by one, which is one of the reasons why Chinese characters are difficult to learn. The ancients used "direct pronunciation" and "fanqie" to mark the pronunciation of Chinese characters, but these two methods require knowing many Chinese characters first, so they are not suitable for beginners. The creation of phonetic symbols was a major step forward in the phonetic notation of Chinese characters, but it still has shortcomings in terms of recognition, writing, and application. Now, the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme draft uses internationally accepted Latin letters to annotate Chinese characters, and it can also be used to teach Mandarin Chinese, which is a further step forward than phonetic symbols.

This set of letters is an important tool to help teach Chinese characters and promote Mandarin Chinese. The promotion of this set of phonetic alphabets will play an active role in promoting the improvement of the cultural level of the broad masses of the people in our country and the promotion of the standard pronunciation of Chinese throughout the country. When ethnic minorities in our country create and reform their own ethnic scripts, they can use the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme as a common foundation and use it to directly learn Chinese, which is conducive to mutual learning and communication among people of all ethnic groups. Scientific and technical terms and symbols, as well as foreign transliterations, can also be written with this set of letters.

In addition, language workers can also use this set of phonetic alphabets to study and experiment with further reforms of Chinese characters.

From these aspects, the formulation and implementation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme are necessary.

II. The Production Process of This Draft

The research and advocacy of the Chinese phonetic alphabet has a long history in our country, dating back more than sixty years from the end of the Qing Dynasty. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese Writing Reform Association was established, and later the Chinese Writing Reform Research Committee was established to engage in the simplification of Chinese characters and the research of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme. In December 1954, the State Council established the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, inviting experts to study and draft a Chinese character simplification plan and a Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme. In October 1955, at the National Writing Reform Conference, the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, in addition to proposing a draft of the Chinese character simplification plan, made a report on the drafting of the phonetic alphabet scheme and distributed several draft schemes to solicit opinions from the representatives attending the meeting.

In February 1956, the Chinese Writing Reform Committee published the "Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme (Draft)" (this is the initial draft, hereinafter referred to as the original draft), requesting the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the CPPCC committees of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions to discuss it, and at the same time published it in newspapers and periodicals to publicly solicit opinions from all aspects of the country. In early March, the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the CPPCC held an enlarged meeting for discussion, and after the meeting, a group discussion was held, attended by 162 members of the National Committee of the CPPCC, members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and people from the fields of culture, education, science, and technology in Beijing. From March to April, 22 provinces, 3 cities, 2 autonomous regions, 26 provincial-level cities, 4 counties, and 1 autonomous prefecture organized discussions in CPPCCs across the country, with the participation of more than 10,000 people. When the local CPPCCs held discussions, in addition to the local CPPCC members, they also invited members of the National Committee of the CPPCC and deputies to the National People's Congress in the locality, heads of local cultural and educational departments and people's organizations, Chinese language teachers in primary and secondary schools, and people who have studied languages and writing to participate. Departments closely related to the phonetic alphabet, such as postal and telecommunications, navy, railways, and blind education, have conducted special discussions on the original draft. In addition, from February to September 1956, the Chinese Writing Reform Committee received more than 4,300 written opinions from people from all over the country and overseas Chinese.

According to the above opinions, the Chinese Writing Reform Committee put forward its revised opinions on the original draft in August 1956 and submitted them to the State Council for review. In October, the State Council established the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Review Committee to review it. Over the past year, the Review Committee has held five meetings, many seminars, and invited 178 representatives from the language, education, literature, art, news, publishing, science and technology, translation circles, as well as troops and people's organizations in Beijing to hold seminars, and at the same time solicited opinions in writing from 100 language workers in 39 cities outside Beijing. After repeated discussions and consultations, the Review Committee proposed the "Revised Draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme" in October 1957. After discussion by the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the CPPCC, it was adopted by the 60th plenary meeting of the State Council on November 1 and prepared to be submitted to the next meeting of the National People's Congress for discussion and approval, and it was decided to publish it in the newspaper as the "Draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme" so that the people of the whole country would know about it in advance.

III. Some Explanations on the Content of the Draft

The main features of this Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme draft (hereinafter referred to as the new draft) passed by the State Council are: it only uses 26 internationally used Latin letters, without adding new letters; it adopts four sets of double letters (double letters have simplified writing methods); the initials ㄐ (ji), ㄑ (qi), and ㄒ (xi) use three dedicated letters, so that the entire scheme basically has no allophonic variations; the system is relatively neat, and it is convenient to learn and apply. Of course, people have put forward various different requirements for the phonetic alphabet scheme from different perspectives, and it is difficult to meet these requirements at the same time. Therefore, the new draft will not make everyone feel satisfied. But it can be said that because it reflects the opinions of the majority of participants in the discussion and is relatively close to the traditional usage of Latin letters in our country, it is easier to promote.

This new draft mainly consists of an alphabet table, an initial table, and a final table. In addition, it also stipulates the usage of tone and separation symbols. The Chinese characters annotated under each initial in the initial table only use its initial when spelling, not its final.

Compared with the original draft published by the Chinese Writing Reform Committee in 1956, the new draft has been revised in several aspects. The issues that once caused heated discussions on the arrangement of letters have been resolved through these revisions. The following is a brief explanation of these revisions:

1. The writing of the initials ㄓ (zhi), ㄔ (chi), and ㄕ (shi)
	In the original draft, ㄓ ㄔ ㄕ were written as ẑ ĉ ŝ. These new letters were not welcomed, and there were some inconveniences in practical use. The original draft stipulated that zh ch sh should be used as substitutes. The new draft uses the substitutes as the official writing method, that is, uses zh ch sh as ㄓ ㄔ ㄕ. The advantage of these three sets of double letters is that they conform to general habits, and the system is neat when compared with z c s, which is very convenient for teaching.

2. The writing of 兀 (wu)
	In the original draft, 兀 was written as ŋ (for example, "浪" (lang) was written as laŋ), with ng as a substitute. Now, this new draft does not use new letters, so 兀 is also written as ng ("浪" is written as lang).
	In this way, the new draft uses a total of four sets of double letters (zh ch sh ng), so some syllables are longer to write than in the original draft, but the average length of syllables does not exceed three letters. These four sets of double letters can be abbreviated as ż ċ ṡ ŋ when annotating Chinese characters, shortening the spelling.

3. The writing of the initials ㄐ (ji), ㄑ (qi), and ㄒ (xi)
	In the original draft, ㄐ ㄑ ㄒ were written as j q x (for example, "基欺希" (ji qi xi) were written as ʗi qi xi), where ʗ is a borrowed Russian letter. At the same time, this letter is easy to confuse with other letters when writing, so the new draft changes to use j. ㄐ ㄑ ㄒ could also be used g k h or zh ch sh to兼职变读(jianzhi biandu) (that is, use gi ki hi or zhi chi shi to represent "基欺希" (ji qi xi)). Both of these allophonic variations have a certain basis, each with its advantages and disadvantages, but allophonic variations are not as good as no allophonic variations. The new draft uses j q x to represent ㄐ ㄑ ㄒ ("基欺希" is written as ji qi xi), so all initials have no allophonic variations.

4. j, w changed to y, w
	Since j is changed to a letter representing ㄐ (ji), the j in the original draft is changed to y in the new draft. The letters y and w have the effect of making the syllables of polysyllabic words clear, so they are still retained. In the new draft, "大娘" (daniang) is written as daniang, and "丹阳" (Danyang) is written as danyang, and the two are never confused. But if there is only i and y is not retained, then "大娘" and "丹阳" would both be written as daniang, and the separation symbol would have to be used to distinguish them. As a result, there would be unclear syllable differentiation or too many separation symbols.

5. The writing of the final ㄩ (yu)
	In the original draft, ㄩ was written as y (for example, "吕" (lü) was written as ly). In the new draft, y has been used to replace j in the original draft, so ü is used as ㄩ ("吕" is written as lü). The two dots above ü can be omitted in most cases and will not be confused with u. ㄐㄩ (ju), ㄑㄩ (qu), ㄒㄩ (xu) are all written as ju qu xu; only when they are after n and l can the two dots not be omitted (for example, "女" (nü) is written as nü, "吕" (lü) is written as lü), but there are very few such characters. If there is no ü on the typing and telegraph equipment, yu can be used instead ("女, 吕" are written as nyu, lyu).

6. The writing of the finals of syllables such as "知, 资"
	In the original draft, the finals of syllables such as "知, 蚩, 诗, 日, 资, 雌, 思" were written as ɿ (for example, "知" (zhi) was written as tɿ, "资" (zi) was written as tsɿ), with i as a substitute. The new draft uses the substitute as the official writing method ("知" is written as zhi, "资" is written as zi). The historical origin of this final is ㄧ (yi), and now ㄧ (yi) in Beijing pronunciation does not appear after zh ch sh r, nor does it appear after z c s, so using i to also represent this final will not be confused with ㄧ (yi).

7. Some revisions to the final spelling
	au (ao), iau (yao) in the original draft are changed to ao, iao in the new draft to avoid confusing au with an when writing. (In the original draft, "高, 桥" (gao, qiao) were written as gau, qiau, which were easy to confuse with "干" (gan) and "钳" (qian). The new draft writes them as gao, qiao, which will not be confusing.)
	ung, yng in the original draft are changed to ong, iong in the new draft to make the word form clear. iong is more in line with the actual pronunciation than yng. (For example, in the original draft "公, 兄" (gong, xiong) were written as gung, xyng. The new draft changes them to gong, xiong.)
	The spelling of ㄧㄡ (you), ㄨㄟ (wei), ㄨㄣ (wen) is changed in the new draft to use iou, uei, uen as the basic form, but when a consonant is added in front, they are all written as iu, ui, un (for example, "牛, 归, 论" (niu, gui, lun) are written as niu, gui, lun). The basic form is more in line with the actual pronunciation, and the abbreviation makes the spelling shorter.
	The new draft stipulates that when ㄝ is used as a syllable alone, it is written as ê. In Beijing pronunciation, "诶" (ê), which is a word indicating greeting or agreeing, is the only character where ㄝ becomes a syllable alone.

8. Revision of tone symbols
	The rising tone symbol is changed from bottom left to top right in the new draft. The neutral tone symbol has been canceled.

9. Revision of the separation symbol
	The separation symbol "′" (pointed downward) in the original draft is changed to "'" (curved small apostrophe) in the new draft. In the new draft, the separation symbol is only used when a syllable starting with a, o, or e is confused with the preceding syllable, so the chance of it appearing is very small.

10. The original draft only stipulated the pronunciation of the letters, but did not stipulate the names of the letters. In order to facilitate naming, it is necessary to stipulate the names of the letters. The names of the phonetic alphabet stipulated in the new draft refer to the names of letters in various countries using Latin letters, and also take into account the characteristics of Chinese and practical convenience.

　　关于汉语拼音方案草案的说明
    中国文字改革委员会
    一、为什么要制定和推行汉语拼音方案？
    制定和推行汉语拼音方案是当前文字改革工作的主要任务之一。
    当前文字改革工作的目的，是为了便利人民学习和使用汉字，逐步统一汉字读音和统一汉民族语言，使我们的语言和文字能够更好地为人民掌握，更好地为我国社会主义建设服务，而不是废除汉字。至于汉字是否需要和是否适宜进行根本改革的问题，就是把汉字改革成为拼音文字的问题，是另一种性质的问题，不属于当前文字改革的范围，不应该与当前文字改革的任务混淆起来。
    当前的文字改革的任务是：（1）简化汉字，以便利汉字的教学和应用；（2）推广以北京语音为标准音的普通话，以逐渐统一汉民族语言；（3）制定和推行汉语拼音方案，用来为汉字注音，帮助教学汉字、统一读音和推广普通话。
    汉字在字面上看不出读音（就是形声字的读音也不能从字面准确地判断），必须一个个记，这是汉字难学的原因之一。古人曾经用“直音”和“反切”来标汉字的音，但是这两种办法都要先认识许多汉字，因此初学文字的人不能适用。注音字母的产生是汉字标音的一大进步，但是它在辨认、书写和应用方面还有缺点。现在汉语拼音方案草案采用国际通行的拉丁字母来为汉字注音，并且可以用来教学普通话，就比注音字母又前进了一步。
    这一套字母是帮助教学汉字和推广普通话的重要工具。这一套拼音字母的推行，对于我国广大人民文化水平的提高和汉语标准语音在全国的推广，将要起积极的促进的作用。我国少数民族在创制和改革自己的民族文字的时候，可以把汉语拼音方案作为共同的基础，并且可以利用它来直接学习汉语，这就有利于各族人民之间的互相学习和沟通。科学技术上的术语和符号以及对外译音，也可以用这套字母来书写。
    此外，语文工作者还可以用这套拼音字母研究和实验中国文字的进一步改革。
    从这几方面来说，汉语拼音方案的制定和推行都是必要的。
    二、这个草案的产生经过
    汉语拼音字母的研究和提倡，在我国有很长的历史，从清末算起也已经有六十多年了。1949年中华人民共和国成立以后，成立了中国文字改革协会，后来又设立中国文字改革研究委员会，从事汉字简化和汉语拼音方案的研究。1954年12月，国务院设立中国文字改革委员会，邀集专家研究和拟订汉字简化方案和汉语拼音方案。1955年10月，在全国文字改革会议上，中国文字改革委员会除了提出汉字简化方案草案以外，曾就拼音方案的拟订工作作了报告，并且分发几种方案草稿，征求到会代表的意见。
    1956年2月，中国文字改革委员会发表“汉语拼音方案（草案）”（这是最初的草案，以下简称原草案），提请政协全国委员会和政协各省、市、自治区委员会讨论，同时在报纸刊物上发表，公开向全国各方面征求意见。3月初，政协全国委员会常务委员会召开扩大会议进行讨论，会后并举行分组座谈会，参加的有在京政协全国委员会委员、人大常委会委员和文教、科技方面人士162人。从3月到4月，全国各地政协中组织了讨论的有22个省、3个市、2个自治区、26个省辖市、4个县和1个自治州，参加的人数在一万以上。各地政协在讨论的时候，除了当地的政协委员以外，还邀请了在当地的政协全国委员会委员和人大代表，当地文教部门和人民团体的负责人，大中小学的语文教师和对语言文字有研究的人参加。邮电、海军、铁道、盲人教育等同拼音字母关系比较密切的部门都对原草案进行了专门的讨论。此外，从1956年2月至9月，中国文字改革委员会收到全国各地各方面人士以及海外华侨的书面意见4300多件。
    中国文字改革委员会根据以上各方面的意见，在1956年8月提出了对于这个原草案的修正意见，送请国务院审核。10月，国务院设立汉语拼音方案审订委员会加以审议。一年来，审订委员会开过五次会议，多次座谈，并邀请过在北京的语言、教育、文艺、新闻、出版、科技、翻译各界以及部队和人民团体的代表178人举行座谈，同时向京外39个城市的100位语文工作者书面征求意见。经过反复讨论和磋商，审订委员会在1957年10月提出“汉语拼音方案修正草案”，经政协全国委员会常务委员会的扩大会议讨论，11月1日由国务院全体会议第60次会议通过，准备提请全国人民代表大会下次会议讨论和批准，并且决定作为“汉语拼音方案草案”登报公布，让全国人民事先知道。
    三、关于草案内容的一些说明
    国务院通过的这个汉语拼音方案草案（以下简称新草案）的主要特点是：它只用26个国际通用的拉丁字母，不增加新字母；采用四组双字母（双字母有省写法）；声母ㄐ（基）ㄑ（欺）ㄒ（希）用三个专用字母，使整个方案基本上没有变读；系统比较整齐，学习和应用都很方便。当然，人们从不同的角度对拼音方案提出了种种不同的要求，要同时满足这些要求是很困难的，因此，新草案也不会使每个人都觉得满意。但是可以说，由于它反映了参加讨论的大多数人的意见，跟拉丁字母在我国的传统用法也比较接近，它比较容易推行。
    这个新草案主要由字母表、声母表和韵母表构成，另外还规定了声调和隔音这两种符号的用法。声母表中每个声母下面所注的汉字，在拼音的时候，只用它的声母，不用它的韵母。
    同1956年中国文字改革委员会发表的原草案相比，新草案已经作了几点修正。关于字母安排上曾经引起热烈讨论的问题，通过这些修正都得到了解决。下面是关于这些修正的简要说明：
    1、声母ㄓ（知）ㄔ（蚩）?（诗）的写法
    原草案中ㄓㄔ?写作???，这些新字母不为人所欢迎，在实用上也有一些不便。原草案规定用zh　ch　sh作为代用式，新草案就用代用式作为正式写法，就是以zh　ch　sh作为ㄓㄔ?。这三组双字母的好处是符合一般习惯，而且同z　c　s对照起来系统整齐，教学上有很大方便。
    2、兀（唔）的写法
    原草案中兀写作?（例如“浪”写作la?），以ng作为代用式。现在这个新草案不用新字母，因此兀也写作ng（“浪”就写作lang）。
    这样，新草案一共采用四组双字母（zh　ch　Sh　ng），因此有些音节写起来比原草案要长些，但是音节的平均长度不超过三个字母。这四组双字母在汉字上注音，可以省写作????，使拼式缩短。
    3、声母ㄐ（基）ㄑ（欺）ㄒ（希）的写法
    原草案中ㄐㄑㄒ写作j　q　x（例如“基欺希”写作　чi　q　i
　xi），其中ч是借用的俄文字母，同时这个字母在书写上容易跟别的字母相混，因此新草案改用j。ㄐㄑㄒ本来也可以用g　k　h或zh　ch　sh来兼职变读（就是用gi　ki　hi或zhi　chi　shi来表示
  “基欺希”），这两种变读法都有一定的根据，各有利弊，但是变读总不如不变读好。新草案用j　q　x表示ㄐㄑㄒ（“基欺希”就写作ji　qi　xi），全部声母就没有变读。
    4、j，w改为y，w
    由于j改作表示ㄐ（基）的字母，所以原草案里的j新草案改为y。y，w这两个字母有使多音节词的音节分明等作用，所以仍旧保留了。在新草案中，“大娘”写作daniang，“丹阳”写作danyang，二者决不混淆。但是如果只有i，不保留y，那末“大娘”“丹阳”都写成daniang，只好用隔音符号来加以区分。结果会产生音节区分不明或者隔音符号出现过多的现象。
    5、韵母ㄩ（迂）的写法
    原草案中ㄩ写作y（例如“吕”写作ly），新草案中y已经用来代替原草案里的j，因此采用ü作ㄩ（“吕”写作lü）。ü上面的两点在极大多数场合可以省去，不会跟u相混。ㄐㄩ（居）ㄑㄩ（区）ㄒㄩ（虚）一律写作ju　qu　xu；只有在n，l后面不能省去两点（例如“女”写作nü，“吕”写作lü），但是这类字是很少的。打字和电报设备上如果没有ü，可以用yu代替（“女、吕”写作nyu，lyu）。
    6、“知、资”等音节的韵母的写法
    原草案中“知、蚩、诗、日、资、雌、思”等音节的韵母写作?（例如“知”写作?，“资”写作?），以i为代用式。新草案就以代用式为正式写法（“知”写作zhi，“资”写作zi）。这个韵母的历史来源是ㄧ（衣），而现在北京语音里ㄧ（衣）不在zh　ch　sh　r后面出现，也不在z　c　s后面出现，用i兼表这个韵母不会跟ㄧ（衣）相混。
    7、韵母拼法的一些修正
    原草案里的au（熬），iau（腰）新草案改为ao，iao，避免书写时au同an相混。（原草案“高、桥”写作gau，qiau，容易同“干”gan，“钳”qian相混，新草案写作gao，qiao，就不会混淆了。）
    原草案里的ung，yng新草案改为ong，iong，使词形清楚，iong比yng更符合实际语音。（例如原草案“公、兄”写作gung，xyng，新草案改为gong，xiong。）
    ㄧㄡ（忧）、ㄨ?（威）、ㄨㄣ（温）的拼法新草案改为以iou，uei，uen为基本式，但是前面加声母的时候一律写成iu，ui，un（例如“牛、归、论”写作niu，gui，lun）。基本式更符合实际语音，省写法使拼式简短。
    新草案规定：ㄝ单独作为音节的时候写成?。北京语音里，ㄝ单独成为音节的只有“诶”这一个字，它是表示招呼或答应的语气词。
    8、声调符号的修正
    阳平符号新草案改为从左下向右上。取消了轻声符号。
    9、隔音符号的修正
    原草案里的隔音符号“′”（尖头向下）新草案改为“’”（弯头小撇）。隔音符号在新草案中只在a，o，e开头的音节跟前面的音节发生混淆的时候使用，出现的机会很少。
    10、原草案只规定字母的发音，没有规定字母的名称。为了便于称呼，有规定字母名称的必要。新草案规定的这套拼音字母的名称，是参考了使用拉丁字母各国的字母名称，并且考虑了汉语的特点和实用的方便拟订出来的。
