　　Soviet Union Creates New Method to Prevent Metal from Rusting
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Soviet scientists have created a new method of using ultrasound to give metal anti-corrosion properties. Using this method, rust can be removed from pipes and various equipment more simply, quickly, and economically, and ships can be protected more reliably, making the hull resistant to corrosion.
    The operation is as follows: a steel plate with thick rust is placed in a small sink. An ultrasonic vibrator is placed on top. Under the action of strong ultrasonic vibration, a layer of brown precipitate "flows down" from the steel plate, and this process ends after a few minutes. At this time, the steel plate has become very clean and shiny.
    Experiments have shown that metal that has been subjected to ultrasonic vibration will not rust for a certain period of time, even when placed in a highly corrosive solution.

　　超声波的新用途
　　苏联创造防止金属生锈新方法
    据新华社讯　苏联科学家创造了一种利用超声波来使金属具有抗腐蚀能力的新方法。利用这种方法能够更简单、更快、更经济地清除管道和各种设备的铁锈，更可靠地保护轮船，使船身不受腐蚀。
    操作过程是：把长有厚锈的钢板放入一个不大的水槽里。在上面安放一个超声波振动器。在强力的超声波振动的作用下，一层棕色的沉淀就从钢板上“流下”，经过几分钟这一过程即告结束。这时，钢板已变得十分洁净和闪闪发光了。
    实验证明，受过超声波振动作用的金属，在一定时间内，甚至放在腐蚀性很强的溶液中也不会生锈。
