　　Community Director Old Kuang Uncle found the accountant early in the morning, wanting to personally check an account; at the same time, he needed to call the township to ask the Party Secretary for instructions on a "brain-racking" problem. The Third Production Team proposed using walking plows to harvest peanuts. The reason was: this area is all sandy soil, and the peanuts are planted in clumps. Just one pass with a walking plow would turn all the peanuts out, without losing a single one. This would be more labor-saving and faster than digging them up clump by clump with hoes. However, Old Kuang Uncle thought this was impossible. He had farmed all his life and had never seen peanuts harvested this way. Therefore, he called the Township Party Secretary first thing in the morning to help him deal with this complex matter. But the phone always said, "The Secretary is not here," which annoyed him greatly:
　　"This new Secretary is really strange! I've called several times looking for him, but I just can't find him!"
　　"What's the new Secretary like?" the accountant asked.
　　"Who cares what he's like, he's just a bureaucrat! Otherwise, why hasn't he come to our community after three days of being here!"
　　Old Kuang Uncle looked at the top of the accountant's head and said:
　　"Quick, use the abacus to calculate it again. I'll call Yangzhuangzi Community, maybe the Secretary is there!"
　　At this moment, two people came in one after the other. One was a middle-aged man dressed in all black. Seeing that the two people in the room were busy, he quietly sat on the long bench. The other was Old Man Yang, a "Five Guarantees" household in the community. He was eighty years old and walked in shakily.
　　"Hey, Director, how's the—matter going?"
　　"What matter? Oh, the vegetable planting? That's just not going to work!"
　　"Ha! I knew you wouldn't want to part with that little bit of money." The old man said humorously, "I'm so old, and the community provides me with the 'Five Guarantees,' I'm grateful to the government. But I feel bad when I'm idle! I can still manage to tidy up the vegetable garden, especially since our community still has to go to the city to buy vegetables."
　　"Uncle Yang, don't ramble on! Buying vegetable seeds... Hello, hello! Is this Yangzhuangzi? Is the Secretary there? No? This—where has he run off to, he must have gone up to the sky!" He threw down the receiver in annoyance, and then explained to the old man, "Yes, buying vegetable seeds, building fences... these all cost money!"
　　"See, I told you, you just don't want to spend it..."
　　At this moment, a young man suddenly came in, rushing at the Community Director and shouting:
　　"Director! The Third Team's method of harvesting peanuts is really good. They'll finish everything today, and they'll plant autumn wheat tomorrow! But for us, it will take another five days to dig them all up."
　　Before the Community Director could finish listening, he picked up the phone again.
　　"What are you yelling about! Aren't I trying to find the Township Party Secretary to discuss it? The Third Team is just trying to be fancy, trying to make extra money! See if the Party Secretary doesn't criticize them!"
　　The middle-aged man sitting on the long bench stood up, wanting to say something, but was blocked by Old Kuang Uncle, who was holding the receiver to his ear with both hands:
　　"Comrade, don't be in a hurry, if you have something to say, sit there and wait!"
　　After saying that, he yelled into the phone again. The middle-aged man glanced at him, smiled, and then turned back to pull the young man who had just come in:
　　"Let's go, we'll go to the peanut field and take a look."
　　As they were leaving the room, the middle-aged man turned back and said to Old Man Yang:
　　"Old Uncle, we'll solve the vegetable planting issue tonight, I don't think there will be any problems."
　　The Community Director was still on the phone, ignoring the middle-aged man.
　　All day long, Old Kuang Uncle couldn't find the Party Secretary on the phone. It wasn't until he received a call from the township saying that the Secretary wouldn't be back today that he helplessly put down the receiver. At this time, the middle-aged man who had come in the morning returned. Old Kuang Uncle waved his hand at him unhappily, telling him to wait a little longer. But a burst of shouting from the young men and women came from the yard:
　　"Secretary Chen, guess how many peanuts we harvested?"
　　The middle-aged man turned around to greet them. The young man who had come in the morning emerged from the crowd, beaming:
　　"Secretary Chen, with the walking plow, we can complete the task tomorrow! The day after tomorrow, we can also plow the land and sow wheat!"
　　At this moment, Community Director Old Kuang Uncle stared blankly at the middle-aged man, surprised, wondering: Could this be the Township Party Secretary?
　　Secretary Chen walked over and warmly shook his hand:
　　"Comrade Kuang Baohe, let's go to the home of the 'Five Guarantees' household, Old Man Yang. He's old and doesn't walk well. Let's listen to his ideas about planting vegetables. You know, this way, the problem of the community members eating vegetables in the winter can be completely solved!"

    找乡委书记
    袁小泉
    社主任老匡叔一早便把会计找来，他要亲自查一笔账；一面还要打电话给乡里，向党委书记请示一个“伤脑筋”的问题。第三生产队提出了要用步犁出花生。理由是：这一带都是砂地，花生又都是撮秧子的，只要用步犁一趟，花生都翻了出来，一个也不丢。这样比用镐头一撮撮去刨，又省工，收活又快。但是老匡叔认为这不可能，他种了一辈子地，从来没有看见过这样出花生。所以，一清早就打电话找乡委书记，帮他处理这件复杂的事。可是电话里却总传来“书记不在”，这使他很恼火：
    “这个新来的书记真怪！打了几次电话找他，就是找不到！”
    “新来的书记什么样？”会计问。
    “管他什么样，反正也是个官僚主义！要不，来了三天了，他怎么就不到咱们社里来！”
    老匡叔看了看会计那脑瓜顶说：
    “你快用算盘再打一遍，我给杨庄子社打个电话，书记也许在那里！”
    这时，外面先后进来两个人。一个是穿着一身黑的中年人。他看到屋里两个人都忙着，不声不响地坐在长凳上。一个是社里的五保户杨老大爷，他八十岁了，颤巍巍地走进来。
    “呶，主任，事——怎么样啦？”
    “什么事？噢，种菜的事？那怎么能成！”
    “哈！我就知道你舍不得那点钱。”老头很有风趣地说：“我这么大年纪，社里给我‘五保’，我感谢政府。可我闲着就不好受！收拾一下菜园子还干得了，何况咱社里吃菜还得进市去买。”
    “杨大叔，不要叨咕啦！买菜子……喂，喂！杨庄子吗？书记在不在你那里？没有？这——他跑到那去啦，想必是上了天！”他没好气地扔下耳机，又向这老头解释：“是啊，买菜子，夹篱障子……这都得要钱哪！”
    “看，我说是不是，你就舍不得……”
    这时，突然进来个小伙子，楞头楞脑地冲着社主任嚷道：
    “主任！人家三队出花生的办法就是好嘛。今天全部干完，明天人家就种秋麦了！可我们，再有五天也刨不完。”
    社主任没等他说完，又拿起来电话
    “你吵什么！我这不是在找乡党委书记商量吗？三队尽出花样，想外快！看党委书记不批评他们才怪！”
    那个坐在长凳上的中年人站起来，向前去想说些什么，但被双手捧着耳机的老匡叔挡住了：
    “同志，别忙，你有什么事情，先坐那等等再说！”
    说完，他便又向着电话里嚷起来。那个中年人看了他一眼，笑了笑，便不再说什么，回头拉过刚进来的小伙子：
    “走，我们到花生地里去看看。”
    他们临出屋子，那中年人还回过身来向杨老头说：
    “老大爷，种菜的事，晚上我们解决，我想不会有问题的。”
    社主任一直在打电话，没有理会这个中年人。
    一直到晚上，老匡叔也没有从电话里找到党委书记。直到接到乡里的电话，说是书记今天没有回来，他才无可奈何地放下耳机。这时上午来过的那个中年人回来了，老匡叔不高兴地向他摆摆手，让他再等一会。可是院子里传来的一阵青年和姑娘们的喊声：
    “陈书记，你猜我们出了多少花生？”
    这个中年人转过身来迎接他们。上午来的那个小伙子从人群里冒出来，喜气洋洋地说：
    “陈书记，用步犁，明天我们就可以完成任务！后天我们也可以翻地种麦了！”
    这时，社主任老匡叔直呆呆地看着这个中年人，惊讶地估量着：难道这个就是乡党委书记吗？
    陈书记走过去，亲热地握住他的手：
    “匡保和同志，我们到五保户杨大爷家去吧，他年纪大，不好走路。关于种菜的事，咱们听听他的办法。要知道，这样一来，社员们冬天吃菜的问题，就完全可以解决了！”
