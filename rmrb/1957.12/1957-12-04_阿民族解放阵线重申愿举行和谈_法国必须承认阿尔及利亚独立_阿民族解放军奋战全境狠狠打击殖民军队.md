Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: Tunis dispatch: The Algerian "National Liberation Front" organ "El Moudjahid" published on December 1st an editorial on the Tunisian-Moroccan mediation proposal, saying that the Algerian National Liberation Front is willing to negotiate with the French government to seek a way to peace, but it will never accept any other solution except for the unconditional recognition of Algerian independence.

Prague dispatch: Rabi Bouhali, secretary of the Algerian Communist Party, said in an interview with the editor of "Rude Pravo" that the serious intensification of the war is the characteristic of the current situation in Algeria.

Referring to the so-called Algerian "Fundamental Law" recently passed by the French National Assembly, Bouhali emphasized that the purpose of passing this law is not to solve the Algerian problem, but to use it as an excuse for the French representatives to ask the current United Nations General Assembly to postpone the discussion of the Algerian problem again. He said that the "Fundamental Law" does not recognize the existence of an Algerian state and its sovereignty, and it will make colonial rule even worse than it is now.

Algiers dispatch: While the United Nations General Assembly is meeting to discuss the Algerian issue, the French army is intensifying its military operations against Algerian patriots. At the same time, the Algerian National Liberation Army is also launching attacks throughout Algeria, inflicting heavy blows on the French colonial army.

New York dispatch: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued to discuss the Algerian issue on the 2nd. Saudi Arabian representative Shukairy pointed out in his speech that the French suppression of the Algerian national liberation movement is "an important part of imperialism's actions in North Africa."

Shukairy demanded that France unconditionally recognize Algerian independence, recognize an Algerian provisional government to immediately begin negotiations with France, release political prisoners, and implement a ceasefire.

He also accused Britain of forming an "evil alliance" with France, attempting to jointly prevent the United Nations from taking effective action on the Algerian issue and the Cyprus issue on the next agenda.

Sri Lankan representative Gunawardene said that France's so-called "pacification of Algeria" policy is not achieving its goal. He demanded that France accept the mediation proposal of the King of Morocco and the President of Tunisia.

British representative de Stain and Italian representative Piziani adopted a position of maintaining French colonialism in their speeches.

French Foreign Minister Pineau said at a press conference after the meeting that the French government will continue its "pacification work" and refuse to negotiate with the Algerian National Liberation Front.

    阿民族解放阵线重申愿举行和谈
    法国必须承认阿尔及利亚独立
    阿民族解放军奋战全境狠狠打击殖民军队
    本报综合报道　据新华社3日讯：突尼斯消息：本月1日出版的阿尔及利亚“民族解放阵线”机关报“圣战者报”就突尼斯—摩洛哥的斡旋建议发表社论说，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线愿意同法国政府进行谈判，以谋求导致和平的方法，但是除了无条件地承认阿尔及利亚独立以外，它决不接受任何其他解决办法。
  布拉格消息：阿尔及利亚共产党书记拉比·布哈利向“红色权利报”编辑发表谈话说，战争严重地趋于尖锐化是目前阿尔及利亚局势的特点。
    谈到法国国民议会最近通过的所谓阿尔及利亚“根本法”，布哈利强调指出，通过这个法案的用意不是要解决阿尔及利亚问题，而是为了作为法国代表要求本届联合国大会再度延期讨论阿尔及利亚问题的一个借口。他说，“根本法”不承认有阿尔及利亚国家及其主权的存在，它将使殖民主义统治变得比现在还要坏。
    阿尔及尔消息：在联合国大会开会讨论阿尔及利亚问题的时候，法军加紧对阿尔及利亚的爱国者采取军事行动。同时，阿尔及利亚民族解放军也在阿尔及利亚全境发动攻击，给法国殖民军以沉重的打击。
    纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会2日继续讨论阿尔及利亚问题，沙特阿拉伯代表舒凯里在发言中指出，法国镇压阿尔及利亚民族解放运动是“帝国主义在北非的行为的一个重要部分”。
    舒凯里要求法国无条件承认阿尔及利亚独立，承认一个阿尔及利亚临时政府以便立即开始同法国谈判，释放政治犯，并且实行停火。
    他还指责英国同法国结成“邪恶的同盟”，企图联合阻止联合国在阿尔及利亚问题以及列在下一议程上的塞浦路斯问题上采取有效行动。
    锡兰代表古纳瓦地尼说，法国采取的所谓“绥靖阿尔及利亚”的政策是达不到目的的。他要求法国接受摩洛哥国王和突尼斯总统的调解建议。
    英国代表德斯坦和意大利代表皮齐阿尼在发言中采取了维护法国殖民主义的立场。
    法国外交部长比诺会后在记者招待会上表示，法国政府将继续它的“绥靖工作”，拒绝同阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线进行谈判。
