　　The Birth of Little "Jinpu"

　　On November 16th, when the 16th Direct Express train passed the Yanzhou station, a train attendant on duty came to report that a pregnant woman in the lower berth of seat number five in the third hard-berth carriage was about to give birth. Immediately, the train crew sprang into action. The head train attendant ordered the announcer to ask if any passengers on the train could provide assistance with the delivery. Some train attendants fetched the first-aid kit, while others brought the maternity package, and quickly vacated a room in the soft-berth carriage to set up a "delivery room," moving the pregnant woman inside.

　　More than ten minutes passed, but no one volunteered to help. For the sake of the safe birth of the new life, the head train attendant and the carriage attendant on duty went separately to inquire among the passengers.

　　Later, a comrade from the Teaching and Research Section of Military Health at the Second Military Medical University in Shanghai was found in the hard-berth carriage. He said modestly, "I am responsible for teaching and research and am not very proficient in obstetrics. If no one else is available to deliver the baby, I am willing to help in an emergency."

　　Soon after, a military doctor with the rank of captain arrived, followed by a lieutenant; by this time, all those with some medical knowledge had gathered at the entrance of the "delivery room."

　　In haste, a makeshift obstetrics room was set up: on the table were placed carefully sterilized obstetric instruments: rubber gloves, scissors, forceps, sanitary paper, doctor's gowns, caps, masks, and baby clothes. The train attendants were busy preparing a washbasin and boiling water.

　　At 7:49 p.m., the train's loudspeaker announced to all passengers: "A healthy boy with bright eyes, black hair, and a plump body has been safely born." All the passengers laughed with joy. The head train attendant, who was off duty, gave up his rest time to bathe the little baby and make him clean. The dining car waiter immediately brought a bowl of hot sugar-boiled eggs to the mother.

　　The mother, with a grateful smile, named her child "Jinpu" to commemorate the happy birth of this new life on the people's train. (Chunzu, Wujin Road, Shanghai)

### 小“津浦”的诞生

    小“津浦”的诞生
    11月16日，十六次直达快车过了兖州站的时候，一个值班列车员走来报告说：三号硬席卧车五号下铺有位孕妇要生产了。于是，乘务人员全忙开来了。主任列车员命令播音员，向全列车乘客征询乘客中谁可以来助产。列车员们有的拿药箱，有的拿产包，一方面赶紧让出软席卧铺的一个房间，布置成“临产室”。把孕妇抬进去。
    十几分钟过去了，不见有人来应征。为了新生命安全诞生，主任列车员又和车厢值班列车员分头到乘客中去征询。
    后来在硬席卧车内，找到了一位上海第二军医大学卫勤教研室的同志，他很谦虚地说：“我担任的是教研工作，对产科方面不精，假使真没人接生，我愿意去救急”。
    不多时又找来了一位军医大尉，后面跟了一个少尉；这时凡懂得一点医务方面的人，都聚集在“临产室”门口了。
    仓促间，也设备起了一个产科室：桌上放着经过严密消毒的产具：橡皮手套、剪刀、钳子、卫生草纸、大夫衣帽、口罩、婴儿衣。列车员们忙碌着准备好洗浴盆和开水。
    下午七点四十九分，车上播音器向全列车乘客报喜：“一个活仑仑眼睛，黑黑头发，身体胖胖的男孩子已经平安地诞生了。”所有乘客全都轻快地欢笑起来。已下班的主任列车员放弃了休息时间。把这个小宝贝洗得干干净净，餐车服务员，马上把一碗热烘烘的糖烧鸡蛋端给产妇。
    产妇含着感激的微笑，为孩子取名“津浦”，纪念这个新生命在人民列车上的幸福诞生。（上海武进路纯祖）
