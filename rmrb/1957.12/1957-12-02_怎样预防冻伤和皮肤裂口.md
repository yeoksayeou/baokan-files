　　How to Prevent Frostbite and Skin Cracks
　　Xue Wen
    Frostbite and skin cracks are two of the most common skin problems in winter. Although they are not serious diseases, they can cause a lot of pain. Anyone who has had frostbite knows that it is painful and itchy, and very uncomfortable. Cracked hands or feet make it inconvenient to work and walk.
    Frostbite mainly occurs in the extremities such as hands, feet, ears, and nose. These parts are far from the heart, and blood flow is slow and easily blocked, so they are more prone to frostbite. In the affected area, blood vessels constrict first when exposed to cold, so the skin appears pale and feels cold. If frozen for too long, the nerves that control blood vessel contraction are affected, and the blood vessels will expand and become congested. The accumulation of blood forms hard, itchy lumps. Because the blood accumulated here is venous blood, which contains more carbon dioxide, the skin turns from red to purple. At this point, first-degree frostbite has formed.
    For first-degree frostbite, as long as you pay attention to keeping warm, it can gradually dissipate and return to normal after a few days. If not handled properly, it can continue to deteriorate and develop into second- and third-degree frostbite. The characteristic of second-degree frostbite is that blood circulation disorders are more severe, and blisters occur. By the time it reaches the third degree, blood circulation is completely cut off, the skin turns dark red or black, and eventually becomes gangrenous and falls off. Some people have their fingers, toes, or ears frozen off in this way.
    How to prevent frostbite?
    First of all, we should know that the occurrence of frostbite is closely related to a person's health. Therefore, to prevent frostbite, we must pay attention to maintaining the health of the whole body, establish a good lifestyle, and exercise regularly. Secondly, pay attention to keeping warm, especially the protection of hands, feet, and ears. Third, boots and shoes should fit well, preferably slightly larger, to avoid squeezing the toes and hindering blood circulation. Shoes and socks should be kept dry frequently, and the openings of sock straps and gloves should not be too tight. Fourth, avoid squatting or sitting for long periods of time. If the nature of the work requires squatting or sitting for a long time, you should also move around frequently to promote blood circulation.
    Skin cracks mainly occur on the hands and feet, and sometimes on the face.
    Skin cracks are related to the nature of the skin. People with oily skin are less likely to develop cracks; people with dry skin are more likely to develop cracks.
    Working conditions are also closely related to skin cracks. Some jobs that require constant contact with water often wash away skin oils, making the skin prone to cracking. Frequent outdoor work in winter makes skin oils easily evaporate, also making it prone to cracking.
    It is not difficult to prevent skin cracking in winter. Paying attention to the following things is very effective.
    1. Use soap with less alkali and less irritation for washing hands and face. 2. Reduce the number of times you wash your face and hands appropriately in winter. Under normal circumstances, washing your face once in the morning and evening each day, and washing your hands before meals and after using the toilet is sufficient. 3. After washing your hands and face, it is best to apply some skin-protecting ointment. Lard or peanut oil also have the same effect. 4. Vitamin A has the effect of preventing dry skin, so in winter you should eat more foods rich in vitamin A, such as rapeseed, carrots, sweet potatoes, old pumpkins and other vegetables, as well as oranges, persimmons and other fruits.

　　怎样预防冻伤和皮肤裂口
　　学文
    冻伤和皮肤裂口，是皮肤在冬季最容易发生的两种毛病。这虽然不是什么严重的疾病，但是它给人造成的痛苦可也不小。生过冻伤的人都知道，又痛又痒，很不好受。手上或脚上裂了口，作事、走路都不方便。
    冻伤主要发生在手、脚、耳朵、鼻子这些肢体末梢部分。这些部分离心脏远，血液因流动缓慢容易阻滞，所以比较容易发生冻伤。受冻的部分，血管遇冷先行收缩，因而皮肤显得苍白，摸起来冰凉。如果冻得时间过长，使管理血管收缩的神经受到影响，血管就要扩大充血，由于血液的积聚而成为又硬又痒的硬块。因为积聚在这里的血液是静脉血，含的碳气较多，皮肤也就由红色变成了紫色。这时，便形成了第一度的冻伤。
    对第一度冻伤，只要注意保温，几天之后就可以渐渐消散，恢复常态。如果处理不好，继续恶化下去，可以发展为第二度和第三度冻伤。第二度冻伤的特点是，血液循环障碍更加严重，发生水疱。到了第三度时，血液循环完全断绝，皮肤变成暗红或黑的颜色，最后成为坏疽而脱落下来。有的人就这样冻掉了手指、足趾或耳朵。
    怎样预防冻伤？
    首先我们应当知道，冻伤的发生和人的健康情况是密切相关的。所以要预防冻伤，必须注意保持整个身体的健康，建立良好的生活制度，经常锻炼身体。其次要注意保温，特别应注意手、脚、耳朵的保护。第三、靴鞋要合脚，最好是稍微肥大一些，以免挤压脚趾，妨碍血液循环。鞋袜要经常保持干燥，袜带和手套的口都不要过紧。第四、要避免长时间蹲着或坐着。如果工作性质需要长时间蹲或坐，也要时常活动活动，促进血液的循环。
    皮肤裂口，主要发生在手部和脚上，脸上有时也能发生。
    皮肤裂口和皮肤的性质有关。多脂性的皮肤，发生裂口的较少；皮肤干燥的人，就比较容易发生裂口。
    劳动情况与皮肤裂口也很有关系。有些需要不断和水接触的工作，皮脂经常被洗掉，皮肤就容易裂口。冬季经常从事室外劳动，皮脂容易挥发，也容易裂口。
    要预防皮肤在冬季开裂并不难，能注意以下几件事就很有效。
    一、洗手、洗脸应选用含碱少、刺激性小的肥皂。二、在冬季应把洗脸洗手的次数适当地减少。在一般情况下，每天早晚各洗一次脸，饭前便后洗次手也就可以了。三、手脸洗过之后，最好擦一些保护皮肤的油膏。猪油或花生油，也有同样的效果。四、甲种维生素有防止皮肤干燥的作用，所以冬季应当多吃些富有甲种维生素的食品，如油菜、胡萝卜、白薯、老倭瓜等菜蔬，以及橘子、柿子等水果。
