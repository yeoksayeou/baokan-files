Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 11th December. Anhui Province is currently vigorously rectifying the province's relatively poorly managed "three types" of agricultural cooperatives. In the process of rectification, these agricultural cooperatives have universally mobilized the masses for extensive airing of views and big debates, thereby resolving some long-standing problems within the cooperatives and resolutely improving their work.

Anhui Province currently has 1,685 "three types" of cooperatives, accounting for approximately 10% of the province's total number of agricultural cooperatives. Currently, 1,635 "three types" of cooperatives are undergoing rectification, accounting for 97% of the total number of "three types" of cooperatives. More than 8,500 cadres have gone to the countryside to assist them in carrying out the rectification work.

During the rectification process, various localities convened members' meetings, women's meetings, elderly people's forums, and field meetings, using various methods to mobilize the masses to boldly offer opinions to the leadership. Currently, the masses have basically aired their views thoroughly. Among the adults who participated in the airing of views, approximately 90% have already offered opinions to the agricultural cooperative leadership. These opinions cover all aspects, including the work style of cooperative cadres, business management, and financial systems.

After the extensive airing of views, various localities immediately began to rectify while simultaneously debating. According to the recent key inspection of over one hundred "three types" of cooperatives by the CPC committees of Lu'an, Wuhu, and three other prefectures, it appears that the rectification of more than seventy of these cooperatives has been relatively thorough. These cooperatives have seen improvements in the work style of cadres. Some "three types" of cooperatives have vigorously cleared up financial accounts during the rectification process. The Liu Yang Township Liu He Cooperative in Taihu County specifically organized an account clearing team to clear up and publicize various accounts. The Nanping Cooperative in Yi County not only promptly publicized the accounts but also dealt with the accountant Pan Qinghuang, who had embezzled more than one hundred yuan, and established a strict financial approval system. In the re-election of cooperative cadres in Anle Cooperative in Feidong County, the class line was implemented. Before the re-election, among the 73 production team leaders and above in the cooperative, 42 were poor and lower-middle peasants, 28 were middle peasants, and 3 were upper-middle peasants. After the re-election, among the 76 cooperative cadres above the production team leader level, 58 were poor and lower-middle peasants, and 18 were middle peasants.

The rectification work has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of cooperative members to take the socialist road. Before the rectification of the Nüshan Cooperative in Jiashan County, among the 756 households of cooperative members, 26 households resolutely demanded to withdraw from the cooperative, and 18 households had already withdrawn. Now, the 18 households have returned to the cooperative, and those who originally requested to withdraw have also stated that they will no longer withdraw. Originally, only 760 people participated in production in this cooperative. After the rectification, this number increased to 1,760 people, and the attendance rate reached 100%. This year, wheat was planted quickly and well.

According to the inspection by the five prefectural committees, it was also discovered that the rectification of a small number of "three types" of cooperatives was not thorough enough. The various prefectural committees have now issued specific instructions, requiring various localities to strengthen their leadership over these cooperatives, study the situation of these cooperatives, and ensure that work is thoroughly improved during the rectification process and that the problems that existed in the past are resolved.

　　安徽大力整顿三类社
    普遍发动群众大鸣大放大辩论  狠狠改进社内长期存在的问题
    新华社合肥11日电　安徽省目前正大力整顿全省办得比较差的三类社。这些农业社在整社中普遍发动群众大放大鸣大辩论，从而解决了社内一些长期存在的问题，狠狠地改进了工作。
    安徽省现有一千六百八十五个三类社，约占全省农业社总数的10％。现在正在进行整顿的三类社有一千六百三十五个，占三类社总数的97％。有八千五百多个干部下乡帮助他们进行整顿工作。
    各地在整社中召开了社员会、妇女会、老年人座谈会、田头会，用各种方式发动群众大胆向领导提意见，目前群众基本上鸣放透了。参加鸣放的成年人中，有90％左右已经向农业社领导上提了意见。这些意见包括社干部作风、经营管理、财务制度等各个方面。
    大鸣大放之后，各地即一边辩论，一边大力整改。据中共六安、芜湖等五个地委最近对一百多个三类社进行重点检查的结果看来，其中有七十多个社整改是比较彻底的。这些社在干部作风上有了改进。有些三类社在整社中大力清理了财务账目。太湖县刘羊乡六合社专门组织了清账小组，清理和公布了各种账目。黟县南屏社不仅及时地公布了账目，还对贪污一百多元的会计潘庆煌作了处理，并建立了严格的财务审批制度。肥东县安乐社在改选合作社干部中，贯彻了阶级路线，改选前全社七十三名生产队长以上干部中，贫农、下中农四十二名、中农二十八名、上中农三名。改选后的七十六名生产队以上的社干部，贫农、下中农是五十八名，中农十八名。
    整社工作大大地鼓舞了社员走社会主义的积极性。加山县女山社在整社前，全社七百五十六户社员中坚决要求退社的有二十六户，已退出的有十八户，现在十八户又重新回到社里来，原来要求退社的也都表示不再退社了。这个社原来只有七百六十人参加生产，整社后增加到一千七百六十人，出勤率达到百分之百，今年麦子种得又快又好。
    据五个地委的检查，也发现有少数三类社整改还不够彻底。各地委现已发了专门指示，要求各地加强对这些社的领导，研究这些社的情况，一定要在整社中彻底改进工作，解决过去存在的问题。
