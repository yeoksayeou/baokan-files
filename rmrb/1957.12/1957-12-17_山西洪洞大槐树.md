Shanxi Hongdong Old Pagoda Tree
　　Lǚ Jianzhong

　　Ask me where my ancestors came from,
　　From the old pagoda tree in Hongdong, Shanxi.
                                    ——North China Folk Saying

　　At dusk, I stood alone under the old pagoda tree, with the solemn Martyrs' Pavilion above my head and the quiet Fen River at my feet. The Lüliang Mountains across the Fen River stood like a giant in the fiery red sunset glow.

　　A train pulling out of Hongdong Station broke the tranquility of the twilight, and passengers leaned out of the windows, gazing affectionately at this ancient pagoda tree. The train left behind thick smoke, which rolled and changed colors continuously in the sky above the old pagoda tree, adding a thought-provoking scene to this place full of mythological legends.

　　This old pagoda tree is not only familiar to the people of Shanxi, but also often remembered by the people in the provinces along the Yellow River, such as Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi. Legend has it that in the late Yuan Dynasty, residents in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River mostly died from natural disasters and wars under the cruel rule of foreign races, resulting in scorched earth for thousands of miles. At that time, the Hongdong area of Shanxi was peaceful and densely populated. The government used the area under the old pagoda tree of Guangji Temple as a gathering place to conscript local residents to migrate to other provinces, rebuilding their homes in those barren areas. People bravely departed from here, deeply remembering this old pagoda tree that provided thick shade. Therefore, among the residents in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, there have always been these two affectionate sayings: "Ask me where my ancestors came from, from the old pagoda tree in Hongdong, Shanxi."

　　The people who emerged from under the old pagoda tree have now lived in the Yellow River basin for several dynasties. They are often proud of the courageous spirit of their ancestors who went to foreign lands and conquered difficulties. In order to realize their ancestors' desire to establish a happy life on the banks of the Yellow River, they irrigated the land there with blood and sweat for generations, yet struggled and sighed in the miserable days of Yellow River flooding, hunger, and cold. Until after liberation, with the start of the historic initiative to harness the Yellow River, the banks of the Yellow River shone brightly. The tamed Yellow River flowed through the wilderness, filled with laughter and the clamor of builders everywhere.

　　I remember once, at dawn in early autumn, on the banks of the Yellow River near Zhengzhou, Henan, the lights in the rows of tall buildings had not yet been extinguished, but the morning glow had already reflected on the rolling Yellow River water. I passed through a temporary workers' shed made of white canvas, fluttering in the wind, and walked to the tree-lined river embankment. Several Yellow River water conservancy engineers were discussing the legends of the old pagoda tree in Hongdong with great interest. An old stonemason with a wrinkled face recounted how, in a great famine year during the Yuan Dynasty, his ancestors came to Xingyang County from under the old pagoda tree, lived in a cave, and later worked with the few local survivors to cultivate land. Another young man took out a photo of the "Ancient Old Pagoda Tree Site" in Hongdong from his notebook to show everyone. He said that the photo was bought from Hongdong County by his grandfather before liberation through a friend. In his childhood, his grandfather often looked at the photo of the ancient pagoda tree, already dead but still standing so tall, and told him that this ancient pagoda tree was the third one replanted since the Ming Dynasty. Time flew by, and through many vicissitudes, the Yellow River was still not tamed, and the people's lives were still miserable and bleak. ... Therefore, after graduating from high school, he participated in the Yellow River harnessing project according to the wishes of his deceased grandfather. The ideals that his ancestors could not realize will be realized in the hands of his young generation today.

　　People of the Yellow River basin, I want to tell you now about the changes under the old pagoda tree you cherish. I climbed onto the Guangji Temple platform next to the old pagoda tree and looked around. There are newly built railways and factories, and coal mines under development. The people around him are engaged in peaceful labor and living a happy socialist life. Just listen to the names of those agricultural production cooperatives: Old Pagoda Tree, East is Red, Rainbow Light, Heroic Fire, Steel… These agricultural cooperatives are like stars in the sky, and like the myriad rays of light spraying out from under the old pagoda tree. Since the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program, these agricultural cooperatives have become even more active. The members work happily on the banks of the Fen River during the day, and gather under the loudspeakers to listen to the radio at night. At this moment, the surroundings are so quiet, but I seem to hear the roar of the red portable boiler of the Steel Agricultural Cooperative, and I seem to hear the joyous clamor of the members of the Heroic Fire Agricultural Cooperative debating the ten-year long-term plan.

　　The people under the old pagoda tree and the people in the Yellow River basin are constantly encouraged by the mutual victories they see in the newspapers and hear on the radio. Recently, they have also been seeking some practical connections. Not long ago, Hongzhao County sent their "Old Pagoda Tree Puju Opera Troupe" to the Yellow River basin to meet the people they cherished. Wherever the "Old Pagoda Tree Opera Troupe" went, there were cheers and praises, and people everywhere used the affectionate term "home opera troupe" to receive them.

　　The fiery red sunset glow gradually turned into a purplish-red color. Over there, a light and melodious song came from the threshing ground of the Old Pagoda Tree Agricultural Cooperative. I stepped lightly into the Martyrs' Pavilion on the earthen hill. Six stone tablets stood tall in front of me. I immediately saw the two moving lines of poetry on the first stone tablet:

　　Annihilating enemies and exterminating bandits is truly heroic
　　Heroes emerge from the ancient cave of Hongya

　　These two lines of poetry immediately brought my thoughts back to the years of "no land without war, no day without gunfire." Some almost disappeared but familiar distant memories made me feel particularly close to the inscriptions on the stone tablets about the heroic deeds of the people of Hongdong in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Self-Defense War. Look, the anti-mopping-up struggle, the anti-suppression struggle, the anti-grain-snatching struggle, the anti-trench-digging struggle, the anti-enslavement struggle, the anti-feudal struggle, the anti-puppet-traitor struggle... This is a strong condemnation of imperialism and feudalism that brought endless disasters to the motherland, and also a hymn to a series of earth-shattering struggles led by the Party and the people in an entire revolutionary era. In those long years, where on both sides of the Fen River had not been stained with the blood of martyrs? Under this old pagoda tree that people cherish, when had there been a day of peace? Thinking of this, one cannot help but feel the preciousness of the current peaceful life.

　　I walked out of the Martyrs' Pavilion with reluctance and admiration. The surroundings were still so quiet. When dusk began to envelop the old pagoda tree, the ten thousand lights of Hongdong City and the bright moon rising behind Mount Huo returned light to the earth. (Attached Picture)

　　山西洪洞大槐树

　　问我祖先来何处，山西洪洞大槐树。
                                    ——华北民谚
    傍晚，我独自站在大槐树底下，头上是肃穆的烈士亭，脚下是静静的汾河，汾河对岸的吕梁山像一个巨人似地挺立在火红的晚霞里。
    一列从洪洞车站开出来的列车突破了黄昏的宁静，旅客们从窗口探出头来亲切地望着这棵古槐。列车留下来浓烟，在大槐树上空翻滚着，不断变幻着色彩，给这个富有神话传说的地方增添了一种引人沉思的景色。
    这大槐树不仅山西人民熟识他，冀鲁豫陕等省沿黄河流域的人们也常常怀念着他。相传元朝末年，黄河中下游居民在异族残酷统治下，大多死于天灾兵祸，成了赤地千里的局面。那时山西洪洞一带山河宁静，人烟稠密，官家便以这广济寺大槐树下为集散地，征集当地居民迁往他省，在那些荒芜地带重建家园。人们从这里勇敢地去了，却深深记住这棵浓荫蔽日的大槐树。因此在黄河中下游居民中一直流传着这样两句亲切的话：“问我祖先来何处，山西洪洞大槐树。”
    从大槐树底下挺身走出的人们现在已经在黄河流域生活过几个朝代了，他们经常以自己的祖先那种奔赴异乡，征服困难的勇敢精神而自豪。为了实现祖先在黄河边上建立幸福生活的愿望，他们世世辈辈用血汗灌溉着那里的土地，却又世世辈辈在那黄水泛滥，饥寒交迫的惨苦日子里挣扎、叹息。直到解放以后，随着根治黄河这一历史创举的兴工，黄河边上大放光明了，那被驯服了的黄水流过的原野上到处是欢笑，到处是建设者的喧闹声。
    记得有一次，一个初秋的黎明，河南郑州一带黄河边上那一排排高大建筑物的电灯光还没有熄灭，朝霞却已经映照着那滚滚的黄河水了。我穿过一片迎风抖动着的，用白帆布搭起的临时工棚，走到那绿柳成荫的河堤上，几个黄河水利工程人员在津津有味地谈论着关于洪洞大槐树的传说。一个满脸皱纹的老石工讲述着在元代一个大荒年里，他的祖先如何从大槐树底下来到荥阳县，住在一个山洞里，后来又如何和当地少数幸免于死的人们在一起开荒种田。另一个年轻人从他的笔记本里拿出一张洪洞“古大槐树处”的照片给大家看，他说这照片是解放前他的祖父托朋友从洪洞县城里买来的。他幼年时候，祖父常常看着照片上那棵已经死去的，但还是那样挺拔的古槐告诉他，这古槐已经是从明朝以来重栽的第三棵了。光阴飞逝，几经沧桑，可是黄河水依然不肯驯服，人们的日子依然凄楚悲凉。……因此他高中毕业以后，就按照他死去的祖父的愿望，参加了治理黄河工程。他的先人们没有能够实现的理想今天要在他这年青的一代的手里实现了。
    黄河流域的人们，现在我要告诉你们的，却是你们所怀念着的大槐树底下的变化。我登上大槐树身旁的广济寺平台四处眺望，周围有的是新修的铁路、工厂，有的是正在开发的煤矿，他周围的人们都在进行着和平劳动，过着幸福的社会主义生活。只要听一听那些农业生产合作社名子吧：大槐树、东方红、虹光、雄火、钢铁……这些农业社像是满天的星星，又像是从大槐树下喷射出来的万道光芒。自从全国农业发展纲要公布以后，这些农业社就更活跃起来了，社员们白天在汾河岸上愉快地劳动，夜晚又聚拢在扩音器下听广播。此刻，四周是那样的宁静，但我却仿佛又听到了钢铁农业社那红色的锅驼机在轰鸣，我耳边仿佛又在沸腾着雄火农业社社员们在辩论十年远景规划时那种欢乐的喧嚷声。
    大槐树底下的人们和黄河流域的人们不断被从报纸上看到的和从广播里听到的相互的胜利消息所鼓舞。近来，他们又在寻觅一些实际的联系了。不久前洪赵县曾派出了他们的“大槐树蒲剧团”到黄河流域去和他们所怀念着的人们见面，“大槐树剧团”到了哪里，那里就是一片欢呼声、赞扬声，人们到处用“老家的剧团”这个亲昵的称呼来接待他们。
    火红的晚霞渐渐变成了绛紫色。那边大槐树农业社的打谷场上传来一阵轻悠的歌声。我轻步踏进那边土岗上的烈士亭，六块石碑魁梧地站在我的面前，我一眼就看见第一支石碑上那两行动人的诗句：
    歼敌灭寇实壮烈
    洪崖古洞出英雄
    这两句诗一下子又把我的思绪带回到那“无地无战争，无日无枪声”的年月里去了。一些差不多已经消失了的但又很熟悉的遥远的记忆，使我对石碑上铭刻着洪洞人民在抗日战争和自卫战争当中的壮烈事迹的碑文感到特别亲切。看吧，反扫荡斗争，反清剿斗争，反抢粮斗争，反挖壕斗争，反奴化斗争，反封建斗争，反伪顽斗争……这是对给祖国带来无穷灾难的帝国主义、封建主义的强烈控诉，也是对党领导人民在整整一个革命时代里进行的一系列的、惊天动地的斗争的赞歌。在那漫长的岁月里，这汾河两岸何地不曾染过烈士的鲜血？这被人们怀念着的大槐树下又何曾一日安宁？想到这里，就不能不使人越发感到眼前的和平生活的可贵了。
    我怀着留恋、崇敬的心情走出了烈士亭，四周依然是那样宁静。当暮色开始笼罩着这大槐树的时候，那边洪洞城的万盏灯火，和那霍山背后升起来的一轮明月，又还给大地以光明。（附图片）
