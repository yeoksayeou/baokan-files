Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, December 22nd: A group of Chiang Kai-shek clique elements hiding in Hong Kong and Macau are acting as pirates on the routes between Hong Kong and Macau, constantly looting merchant ships, seeking wealth and murdering people for several years, causing serious losses to the shipping industry in Hong Kong and Macau.

According to newspaper reports, the Chiang Kai-shek group's pirate organizations in Hong Kong and Macau have recently become more active. On December 15th, a motorized sailboat sailing from Macau to Hong Kong was hijacked by pirates. The boat owner, Ma Dai, was beaten and robbed of more than 500 Hong Kong dollars. On the evening of the 14th, the cargo ship "Hai Li" sailing from Hong Kong to Macau was chased by pirates. On the 12th, a regular cargo ship "Si Da" was also attacked by two pirate ships on its way from Macau to Hong Kong. "Si Da" and the pirates fought for 20 minutes before narrowly escaping. On May 31st, this cargo ship was attacked by pirates, and two crew members were injured by the pirates. On October 11th, two irregular cargo ships sailing from Macau to Hong Kong were also hijacked by pirates. One of them, along with the ship and cargo, was looted and has not been found to this day. According to incomplete statistics, in the past six months alone, more than ten Hong Kong and Macau merchant ships have been attacked and looted by pirates of the Chiang Kai-shek group. On May 31st alone, three cargo ships sailing from Macau to Hong Kong were attacked. In addition to the aforementioned "Si Da" being victimized, all the goods on the "Dong Xing Long" were looted, and the "Xin Shun Li" narrowly escaped after a fierce gun battle.

According to disclosures by some shipping industry figures in Macau, from 1950 onwards, the Chiang Kai-shek army stationed in the Wanshan Islands frequently used Chiang's gunboats to intercept Hong Kong and Macau merchant ships and extort so-called "protection fees." After the liberation of the Wanshan Islands, a group of remnants of the Chiang army fled to some small islands near Hong Kong and Taipa and Coloane in Macau, and continued to carry out organized robberies on the Hong Kong-Macau routes. It is revealed that these Chiang gang pirates often openly use the names of the so-called "Sixteenth Detachment of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army of Guangdong Province of the Ministry of National Defense of China" or "Certain Guerrilla Team" to loot merchant ships.

According to newspaper reports, the pirates who rob on the Hong Kong-Macau routes are under the command of the Chiang Kai-shek group. In December 1954, the "Jin Tai Fa" ship sailing from Hong Kong to Macau was hijacked, and eight crew members were pushed into the sea. The pirates also hijacked the ship to Kinmen Island. Because of encountering wind on the way, it was intercepted by Hong Kong police when it sailed back to Hong Kong. The pirate Lin Shun confessed in the Hong Kong court that they "are guerrillas from Kinmen, ordered to intercept ships at sea in Hong Kong and send the intercepted ships to Kinmen." Lin Shun also confessed that they used Hong Kong as a pirate den for the Chiang Kai-shek group. He said that the ship "Jin Hai" they used for robbery sailed out from the Cheung Sha Wan sea area of Hong Kong to carry out robbery. Some of the weapons on the ship were transported off the ship from Aberdeen, Hong Kong, and his own pistol was usually hidden in a wooden house in Cheung Sha Wan.

According to disclosures by some people familiar with the situation in Hong Kong, the Chiang Kai-shek group's pirate organizations in Hong Kong and Macau have close relations with the American spy agencies in Hong Kong. The weapons used by the pirates are all American-made new-style light machine guns and Thompson guns. After the pirates looted merchant ships, they often received rewards from the American spy agencies in Hong Kong in the name of seizing so-called "pro-communist materials."

The pirate acts committed by the Chiang Kai-shek group on the Hong Kong-Macau routes have aroused great anger among Hong Kong and Macau shipping merchants. Some Hong Kong shipping merchants pointed out that some of the current pirate nests are located on some small islands near Hong Kong, and some pirate ships are sometimes openly berthed on the sea off Cheung Chau and Aberdeen, Hong Kong, and obtain supplies in Hong Kong. Therefore, the Hong Kong British authorities should take some practical measures to ensure the safety of maritime transportation.

    真正的海盗行径！
    国民党集团分子连年劫掠商船谋财害命
    航商极为愤怒香港英国当局应采取措施
    新华社香港22日电  一批匿居香港和澳门的蒋介石集团分子在港、澳间的航线上充当海盗，几年来不断劫掠商船，谋财害命，使港、澳航运界遭受严重损失。
    据报纸报道，蒋介石集团在港澳的海盗组织最近又趋于活跃。本月15日，一艘从澳门开往香港的机动帆船被海盗截劫，船主马带被殴打，还被劫去港币五百多元。14日晚上，由香港开往澳门的“海利号”货船，曾被海盗追击。12日，一艘定期货轮“四达号”从澳门开往香港途中，也被两艘海盗船袭击，“四达号”和海盗枪战了二十分钟才侥幸逃脱。5月31日，这艘货轮曾受海盗袭击，两个船员被海盗击伤。10月11日，也有两艘从澳门开往香港的不定期货轮遭受海盗截劫，其中一艘连船带货被劫去，到现在还找不到踪影。据不完全统计，单是最近半年，港澳商船被蒋介石集团的海盗袭击和洗劫的就在十艘以上。其中5月31日一天就有三艘由澳门开往香港的货轮受到袭击，除上述的“四达号”受害外，“东兴隆”号全部货物被洗劫，“新顺利”号则在激烈的枪战后侥幸逃脱。
    据澳门一些航运界人士揭露，从1950年起，当时盘踞在万山群岛的蒋介石军队，就经常用蒋军炮艇来拦劫港澳商船，并勒收所谓“保护费”。万山群岛解放后，一批蒋军残余分子分别逃匿到香港附近的一些小岛和澳门的氹仔、路环等地，继续有组织地在港澳航线上行劫。据揭露，这些蒋帮海盗经常公开用所谓“中国国防部广东省反共救国军第十六中队”或“某某游击队”的名义来劫掠商船。
    据报纸报道，在港澳航线上行劫的海盗是接受蒋介石集团的指挥的。1954年12月，有一艘从香港开往澳门的“金泰发”轮被劫，八个船员被推下海中，海盗还将这艘船劫往金门岛，因为中途遇风，在驶回香港时被香港警察截获。海盗林顺在香港法庭上供认，他们“是金门的游击队，奉命到香港海上截查船只，把截得的船送往金门去”。林顺并供认他们利用香港作为蒋介石集团的海盗窠穴。他说，他们用来行劫的船只“金海号”是从香港长沙环海面开出去行劫的，船上的一部分武器是从香港仔运送下船，他本人的手枪平日藏放在长沙环一间木屋里。
    另据香港一些熟悉情况的人士揭露，蒋介石集团在港澳的海盗组织和香港的美国特务机构有着密切的关系，海盗所使用的武器都是美国制造的新式轻机关枪和汤姆生枪，海盗们劫掠商船后常以所谓缴获“资共物资”的名义，从香港美国特务机构里领到奖赏。
    蒋介石集团在港澳航线上所干的海盗行径，已经引起港、澳航商的极大愤怒，香港一些航商指出，海盗目前的部分窠穴是设在香港附近的一些小岛上，有些海盗船有时还公然泊在长洲和香港仔的海面上，并在香港取得给养。因此，香港英国当局应该采取一些实际措施，来保障海面航运的安全。
