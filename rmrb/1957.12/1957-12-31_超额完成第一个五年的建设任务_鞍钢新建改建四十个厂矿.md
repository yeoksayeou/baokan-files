Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 30th. During the first Five-Year Plan period, Anshan Iron and Steel Company overfulfilled its construction and reconstruction tasks. To date, the company has successively built and rebuilt forty large-scale factories and mines, equipped with modern technology, and put them all into production. In addition, several projects above the quota limit have been partially completed and put into production, and many original factories and mines have undergone technological transformation, resulting in major product output such as ore, pig iron, steel ingots, steel, and coke increasing threefold to fourfold compared to 1952.

	After five years of large-scale construction, no dilapidated industrial buildings can be seen in the Anshan Iron and Steel factory area. The production capacity of the company's main production units is developing at a rate of more than 30% increase annually.

	Due to the completion of dozens of new projects and the great achievements in technological transformation, the backward and outdated enterprise appearance left to Anshan Iron and Steel by the Japanese imperialist rule has been greatly changed. It is now able to produce many kinds of high-grade steel.

    超额完成第一个五年的建设任务
    鞍钢新建改建四十个厂矿
    据新华社鞍山30日电　第一个五年计划期间，鞍山钢铁公司超额完成了新建和改建的任务。到目前为止，这个公司已先后有新建和改建的四十个规模巨大的厂矿，用近代化技术装备起来，并全部投入了生产。另外，还有几个限额以上的工程部分建成并开工生产，许多原有的厂矿进行了技术改造，使矿石、生铁、钢锭、钢材和焦炭等主要产品的产量，分别增长为1952年的三倍到四倍。
    经过五年来大规模的建设，现在的鞍钢厂区里已见不到废弃破烂的工业建筑物。这个公司的主要生产单位的生产能力，都以每年递增30％以上的速度发展着。
    由于几十项新工程的建成和技术改造的巨大成就，日本帝国主义统治时期遗留给鞍钢的落后陈旧的企业面貌，已大大改观。它现在已能生产很多种高级钢材。
