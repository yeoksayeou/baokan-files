    Vigorously Develop Various New Resources and Actively Develop the Food Industry
    Wang Yizhi, Assistant Minister of Food Industry
    During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the food industry developed rapidly. However, due to the gradual improvement of people's living standards, the demand for various foods has greatly increased, and various foods still cannot meet the needs of the people. At present, a new upsurge in industrial and agricultural production is forming in our country, and it will continue to develop. It can be predicted that in the future, on the basis of continuous production development, people's demand for various foods will increase even more and become more urgent. In order to appropriately meet the needs of the people, the food industry should vigorously develop various new resources and actively develop food industry production, while saving industrial grain as much as possible and being conducive to increased grain and cotton production. To this end, all departments must comprehensively utilize existing resources and use various substitute raw materials as much as possible; all enterprises must implement diversified operations.
    The food industry department has great potential in the utilization of existing resources. The technical and economic indicators of major products vary greatly within the same industry. For example, in the soy sauce industry, the national average raw material utilization rate is about 40% to 50%, with a difference of 10% between the highest and lowest. If the existing raw material utilization rate is increased by 10%, one-quarter or one-fifth more soy sauce can be produced, saving the country 100 million jin of grain annually. The sugar production rate of local sugar mills is as high as 10.5% and as low as about 3%. If the experience of adding water and pressing in Fujian Province can be promoted nationwide, and the majority of backward sugar mills can catch up with the advanced ones, the average sugar production rate can be increased by 0.7%, which would increase the country's local sugar production by 12,000 tons per pressing season.
    More importantly, there are still many valuable resources that have not been utilized or are underutilized. For example, cities across the country produce 1.3 million tons of rice bran annually, and every 100 jin of bran can produce 12 jin of rice bran oil, but very little is currently utilized. If it can all be utilized, more than 100,000 tons of rice bran oil can be produced annually. These rice bran oil can be used to produce 200,000 tons of soap and recover more than 9,000 tons of glycerin. This would save some of the edible oil currently used in the soap industry. More than one million tons of soybeans are used as livestock feed annually in urban and rural areas across the country. If soybean cake powder is used instead of soybeans as feed, more than 100,000 tons of soybean oil can be produced annually. According to incomplete statistics nationwide, the annual output of soy sauce is 900,000 tons, of which about 150,000 tons of soybeans are used. If soybean cake is used instead of soybeans to make soy sauce, then the country can increase oil production by 18,000 tons annually.
    Vigorously developing new resources can not only increase the output of the food industry and save the country a lot of industrial grain, but also produce a large amount of high-quality feed for agricultural cooperatives, increase the income of agricultural cooperatives, and thus increase the strength of agricultural cooperatives to invest in agriculture, closely combining the development of the food industry with the development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery production. The full utilization of new resources by the food industry is of great significance in promoting production in mountainous areas. For example, next year's plan to use 100,000 tons of acorns instead of dried melon and grain for wine making is estimated to save more than 70,000 tons of dried melon and grain, which can increase farmers' income by about 12 million yuan and increase national accumulation by more than 48.6 million yuan. The country produces more than 4 million tons of acorns annually. If the utilization can be expanded year by year, the country can save at least hundreds of thousands of tons, or even more than one million tons, of dried melon and grain annually. There are many raw materials that can replace dried melon and grain for wine making across the country, such as black dates, persimmons, wild grapes, hawthorns, and so on. If they can be actively utilized, the output of white wine and fruit wine can also be greatly increased. There are many kinds of oil crops that have not been widely utilized across the country. The planned purchase of cocklebur, seepweed seeds, and ailanthus seeds this year is about 100,000 tons, which can increase farmers' income by 12 million yuan. If they can all be utilized this winter and next spring, calculated at an average oil yield of 17%, it can increase the production of vegetable oil by 17,000 tons, which is equivalent to the oil yield of more than 120,000 tons of soybeans. At the same time, 65,000 tons of oil cake can also be produced. If half of it is mixed with silage to feed pigs, 382,000 pigs can be raised. The annual output of pork can be 10,100 tons, and 764,000 tons of pig manure fertilizer can be produced. Pig manure fertilizer plus 325,000 tons of cake fertilizer can increase grain production by 108,900 tons. Mountainous areas have a large number of fruits (especially substandard fruits and fallen fruits) that have not been utilized. It is estimated that the country produces 1.7 million tons of citrus, apples, peaches, plums, apricots, grapes, persimmons, etc. annually, of which substandard fruits and fallen fruits account for at least 5% to 10% of the total output, which is 85,000 tons to 170,000 tons. If they can be utilized separately and in a timely manner, a large number of dried fruits, juices, jams, pectins, fruit vinegars, fruit wines, etc. can be produced separately. Unfortunately, this wealth is still largely wasted. The relevant departments of the food industry, agriculture, urban services, and supply and marketing cooperatives have the responsibility to comprehensively plan and utilize them in a planned and step-by-step manner.
    The raw materials of the food industry are mostly agricultural products, some of which are not easy to store for a long time or the output is not large. In addition, many food factories inappropriately carry out specialized production, only producing one product, which brings many difficulties to industrial production, that is, the seasonality of production is very large, and the factory cannot operate all year round. For example, in the sugar and egg product industries, they are basically operating for half a year and stopping for half a year, and there is a serious waste of equipment and labor. This unreasonable phenomenon must be gradually overcome in a planned manner. Experience has proved that as long as all employees establish the idea of building the country with diligence and thrift, and the leaders use their brains and find more ways to implement diversified operations and engage in part-time production, they can fully utilize equipment capacity and labor. For example, egg factories can also operate starch, milk substitutes, dried fruits, dehydrated vegetables, winter vegetables, etc., so that the production period can be extended from five or six months to more than ten months each year, basically achieving all-year-round production. Another example is the alcohol workshop of a sugar factory. In addition to using molasses to produce alcohol, it should also use acorns and other raw materials locally to produce alcohol, so as to achieve all-year-round operation. Sugar factories can also consider trying one or two feasible part-time productions (such as concurrently operating sugarcane and beet farms, etc.) in order to create experience and find suitable part-time avenues, so as to gradually achieve all-year-round production within a certain period of time in the future. The beer, wine, and fragrance industries also have similar situations, and they should also actively create experience and implement part-time production.
    There are difficulties in utilizing new natural resources. For example, mountain and wild raw materials are relatively scattered, and there are certain difficulties in collecting, storing, and transporting them; there are also difficulties in purchasing prices, transportation costs, and business management. Factories lack technical experience, and the product rate may not temporarily reach the ideal indicators, or even may not reach the original quality standards; raw material consumption quotas and processing costs may be too high. But these difficulties can be overcome.
    In order to encourage farmers to actively collect mountain resources and various wild resources, it is necessary to rationally stipulate purchase prices and implement the policy of pricing according to quality and grading. Tax reductions and exemptions should also be appropriately granted within a certain period of time depending on the situation to ensure that the factory does not lose money.

    大力开发各种新资源，积极发展食品工业食品工业
    部部长助理　王毅之
    在第一个五年计划期内，食品工业有了较快的发展。但
  由于人民生活的逐步改善，对各种食品的需要量大大增加，各种食品仍不能满足人民的需要。目前，我国工农业的新生产高潮正在形成，而且将会持久地发展下去。可以预料，今后人民生活在生产不断发展的基础上，对各种食品的需要量将更加增多，更加迫切。为了适当满足人民的需要，食品工业应该在尽可能地节省工业用粮，并有利于粮棉增产的原则下，大力开发各种新的资源，积极发展食品工业生产。为此，各部门就要综合利用现有的各种资源，尽量使用各种代用原料；各个企业要实行多种经营。
    食品工业部门在现有资源的利用方面存在着巨大的潜力。主要产品的技术经济指标，在同一行业中存在着高低过分悬殊的现象。例如酱油工业，全国平均原料利用率为40％至50％左右，高低相差10％。如将现有原料利用率提高10％，即可多产酱油四分之一或五分之一，全年即可为国家节约粮食一亿斤。土糖产糖率高的达10.5％，低的只有3％左右，若能在全国范围内推广福建省加水压榨的经验，使大部落后的糖坊赶上先进的糖坊，平均提高产糖率0.7％，每个榨季即可为国家增产土糖一万二千吨。
    尤其重要的是，目前还有许多有价值的资源还没有被利用或者利用得还很少。例如全国城市中全年共产米糠一百三十万吨，每百斤糠可产糠油十二斤，但现在利用的还很少。若能全部利用，每年可以增产糠油十余万吨。用这些糠油，可以生产肥皂二十万吨，回收甘油九千吨以上。这样就可以把现在用于肥皂工业的部分食用油脂节约下来。全国城乡每年用作喂牲畜的大豆在一百万吨以上，如果以豆饼粉代替大豆做饲料，每年就可以产豆油十余万吨。据全国不完全统计，酱油年产量九十万吨，其中用大豆约十五万吨，如果用豆饼代替大豆做酱油，那末全年就可以为国家增产油脂一万八千吨。
    大力开发新资源，不但可以增加食品工业产量，为国家节约大量工业用粮；并且可以为农业社生产大量的优质饲料，增加农业社的收入，从而增加农业社对农业投资的力量，把食品工业的发展和农、林、渔、牧业生产的发展密切结合起来。食品工业充分地利用新资源，对推动山区生产具有很大的意义。例如明年计划利用十万吨橡子代替瓜干和粮食酿酒，估计可节约瓜干和粮食七万多吨，约可增加农民收入一千二百万元，增加国家积累四千八百六十余万元。全国年产橡子四百余万吨，如能逐年扩大利用，每年至少可以为国家节省瓜干和粮食数十万吨，甚至百万吨以上。全国各地可以代替瓜干和粮食酿酒的原料还很多，如黑枣、柿子、山葡萄、山红果等等。若能积极利用，也可以大大增加白酒和果酒的产量。全国尚未普遍利用的各种油料很多，今年计划收购的苍耳子、盐蒿子、椿树子等约十万吨，可增加农民收入一千二百万元，今冬明春若能全部利用，按平均出油率17％计算，可增产植物油一万七千吨，约相当于十二万多吨大豆的产油量。同时还可以生产油饼六万五千吨。以一半掺和青储饲料养猪，可养猪三十八万二千头。全年可产猪肉一万零一百吨，猪粪肥七十六万四千吨。猪粪肥加上饼肥三十二万五千吨，共可增产粮食十万八千九百吨。山区有大量的果品（尤其是次果和落果），尚未利用。估计全国每年产柑桔、苹果、桃、李、杏、葡萄、柿子等一百七十万吨，其中次果和落果最少占总产量的5％到10％，也就是八万五千吨至十七万吨。若能分别及时利用，就可以分别生产大量果干、果汁、果酱、果胶、果醋、果酒等。可惜这笔财富至今仍有大量浪费。食品工业、农业、城市服务、供销合作社等有关部门有责任全面加以规划，有计划、有步骤地加以利用。
    食品工业的原料由于多是农产品，有些不易长期储存或者产量不多，加上不少食品工厂不适当地进行专业化生产，只生产一种产品，给工业生产带来了不少困难，即生产的季节性很大，工厂不能长年开工。如制糖、蛋品两个行业，大体上都是半年开工半年停工，设备和劳动力都有严重的浪费。这种不合理现象，必须有计划地逐步加以克服。经验证明，只要全体职工树立起勤俭建国的思想，领导上多动脑筋多想办法，实行多种经营，进行兼业生产，就能充分利用设备能力和劳动力。例如蛋厂可以兼营淀粉、代乳粉、果干、脱水蔬菜、冬菜等，这样每年就可把生产期由五、六个月延长到十个月以上，基本上做到全年开工生产。又如糖厂的酒精车间，除利用糖蜜生产酒精外，还应就地利用橡子等原料生产酒精，做到全年开工。糖厂也可以考虑试行一两种切实可行的兼业生产（如兼营甘蔗甜菜农场等），以创造经验，寻找适宜的兼业门路，以便在今后一定时期内，逐步做到全年开工生产，啤酒、葡萄酒、芳香等行业也有类似情况，也应积极创造经验，实行兼业生产。
    利用新的自然资源是有困难的。例如山区和野生原料比较分散，采集、保管、运输有一定困难；收购价格、运输费用、经营管理也有困难。工厂缺乏技术经验，产品率可能暂时达不到理想的指标，甚至可能达不到原来的质量标准；原料消耗定额和加工成本可能过高。但这些困难都是可能克服的。
    为了鼓励农民积极采集山区资源和各种野生资源，需要合理地规定收购价格，贯彻按质论价和分等论价的政策。在税收方面也应分别情况在一定时期内酌予减免，以保证工厂不亏本。
