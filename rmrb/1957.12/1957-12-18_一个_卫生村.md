    A "Sanitation Village"

    Xingbazhan Village in Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, known as a "sanitation village," has not had a single case of infectious disease in the past four years, and general illnesses are also rare.

    The village's experience in sanitation work was presented at the recent CCP Zhejiang Provincial Congress. Hunan and Zhejiang provinces have also organized visiting groups to tour the village.

    Xingbazhan Village has now controlled the occurrence of infectious diseases and achieved basically no mosquitoes, no sparrows, no rats, and greatly reduced flies. The village is clean everywhere, every household is clean, and everyone practices good hygiene. No garbage heaps or foul sewage can be seen in front of or behind the houses. Adults and children change clothes frequently and wash them diligently. The kitchen, toilet, pigsty, and cattle pen are all clean and tidy. People can enjoy the cool of summer nights without fans to drive away mosquitoes, and stored grain is not gnawed by rats. All the farmers in the village are healthy, and since 1954, there has not been any infectious disease. When several villages around this village were plagued by infectious diseases such as diphtheria, measles, and pertussis, not a single person became infected and sick because all the villagers did a good job in prevention.

    Xingbazhan Village has a set of practical and feasible environmental and personal hygiene rules. For several years, they have insisted on a major cleaning once a week. Men, women, old, and young all work together, overturning vats and jars, removing weeds, dredging ditches, filling in depressions, and even scrubbing clean the cracks in doors and walls. The entire village has also implemented fecal management, with all manure pits covered. At the same time, new wells and water ponds have been opened, ensuring that drinking water and water for other uses are separated.

    Currently, the village is carrying out work such as separating humans and livestock, separating ponds for different uses, and eliminating overwintering mosquitoes and flies, striving to become a village free of mosquitoes, flies, rats, sparrows, and diseases in 1958.

    一个“卫生村”
    被称为“卫生村”的浙江省金华县邢八染村，四年来没有发生过传染病，一般疾病也很少发生。
    这个村的卫生工作经验，曾在最近举行的中共浙江省代表会议上介绍。湖南和浙江全省还组织了参观团到这个村去参观。
    邢八染村现在已经控制了传染病的发生和做到基本无蚊、无雀、无鼠，苍蝇也大为减少。村子里处处清洁、户户干净、人人卫生。屋前屋后都看不见垃圾堆和臭污水，大人小孩衣服勤换勤洗，厨房、厕所、猪栏、牛栏都很清洁整齐。夏夜乘凉不用扇子赶蚊子，收下粮食也没有老鼠咬。全村农民个个身体健康，从1954年到现在，没有发生过任何传染病。当这个村子周围的几个村都流行白喉、麻疹、百日咳等传染病时，由于全村农民做好预防工作，没有一个感染生病。
    邢八染村有一套切实可行的环境卫生和个人卫生制度。几年来一直坚持一星期一次大扫除。男女老少一齐动手，翻缸倒钵，铲除杂草，疏通阳沟，填平洼地，连门缝板壁都洗刷干净。全村又实行粪便管理，粪池全部加盖。同时新开了吃水井、用水池，做到吃水用水池塘分开使用。
    目前这个村正在开展人畜分居，分塘用水，消灭越冬蚊蝇等工作，争取1958年做到无蚊、无蝇、无鼠、无雀、无疾病的村庄。
