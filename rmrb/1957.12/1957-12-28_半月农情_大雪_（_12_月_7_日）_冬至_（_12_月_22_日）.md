Bi-Weekly Agricultural Situation
"Heavy Snow" (December 7th) - "Winter Solstice" (December 22nd)

During the half-month period from "Heavy Snow" to "Winter Solstice," the northeastern region, Shandong, the Huaibei Plain, and the hilly areas of southern Jiangsu experienced significant rainfall and snowfall. In southern Heilongjiang, eastern Liaoning, and the hilly areas of Shandong, the snowfall in mid-December was ten times greater than in the same period last year. Since the beginning of winter, there had been little rain or snow, so this heavy snowfall will greatly benefit agricultural production in these areas next year.

There was no snowfall in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, and most parts of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Hebei in early and mid-December.

During this half-month, the temperature in northern Northeast China ranged from -20 to -25 degrees Celsius; in Hebei, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, it ranged from 1 degree Celsius to -5 degrees Celsius; and on Hainan Island, it was generally above 20 degrees Celsius. There is a large difference between the north and south.

Strengthening field management of summer-harvested crops remains an important agricultural activity in many areas. From the situation in this phase, winter wheat and rapeseed are growing well in most areas. However, due to higher temperatures since the beginning of winter, winter wheat and rapeseed in some areas are showing premature bolting and budding. Early flowering of broad beans and peas has also occurred in some individual areas. Pests in some summer-harvested crop fields are also appearing earlier than in previous years due to the warmer weather. In Dongkou, Cili, Chenxi, Mayang, Hengyang and other places in Hunan Province, many rapeseed fields have been infested with aphids.

Generally speaking, around the "Winter Solstice" is the season for applying winter fertilizer to summer-harvested crops in most areas. While applying fertilizer, many areas also cleaned the ditches in wheat and rapeseed fields and combined cleaning the ditches with earthing up around the roots.

Winter irrigation in the northern wheat-producing areas has basically ended, and the application of urine to wheat fields is still underway. According to statistics from Shandong Province in mid-December, over 9.2 million mu of land has been top-dressed with fertilizer and urine, which is six times more than in the same period last year.

The harvesting this year in Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang and other provinces finished earlier than in previous years, and many areas completed this task before the snowfall in mid-December.

Some parts of southern China are still harvesting crops. Most of the three million mu of sweet potatoes in Fujian Province were harvested before the "Winter Solstice." Although sweet potatoes in Fujian were affected by drought this year, the harvest is generally good.

During this period, Guangdong, Fujian and other places are in the peak season for harvesting sugarcane. This year's sugarcane harvest in Fujian and Sichuan is relatively good. The average yield per mu in Fujian can still reach 7,000 jin; this year, many agricultural cooperatives in the Neijiang area of Sichuan Province have achieved yields of 10,000 jin of sugarcane per mu. Some farmers in the sugarcane-producing areas immediately protected the old sugarcane roots after harvesting.

After the "Winter Solstice," the temperature in northern areas will gradually decrease, and the warm climate in southern areas will also change. Many areas have made preparations to protect livestock through the winter before this solar term. In order to ensure that all 8,300 draft cattle in the county safely survive the winter, Jiangpu County in Jiangsu Province held a meeting of model representatives for livestock protection in mid-December and formulated a livestock protection system.

Some pastoral areas should also further carry out disaster prevention, winter survival, weight maintenance, and pregnancy preservation work from this stage onwards. Pastures and herdsmen in Qinghai Province have generally made preparations for lambing and raising lambs.

### 半月农情  “大雪”（12月7日）——“冬至”（12月22日）

    半月农情
    “大雪”（12月7日）——“冬至”（12月22日）
    “大雪”到“冬至”这半个月里，东北地区、山东、淮北平原和江南丘陵地区雨雪较多。黑龙江南部、辽宁东部和山东丘陵地区12月中旬的降雪量比去年同一时期多十倍。入冬以来雨雪稀少，这场大雪对上述地区明年的农业生产将有很大好处。
    山西、陕西、甘肃等省和内蒙古、新疆、河北大部地区在12月上、中旬没有降雪。
    在这半个月，东北北部的气温摄氏零下二十度到二十五度；河北、山西、陕西等地摄氏一度到零下五度；海南岛一般在二十度以上。南北相差很大。
    加强夏熟作物田间管理仍是许多地区的一项重要农事活动。从这一阶段情况看，多数地区的冬麦、油菜生长良好。但是入冬以来气温较高，部分地区的冬麦和油菜有提前拔节、抽苔现象。提早开花的蚕豆、豌豆，个别地区也有出现。一些夏熟作物田里的害虫，也因为天暖比往年发生的早。湖南省的洞口、慈利、辰溪、麻阳、衡阳等地不少油菜田已发生蚜虫。
    就多数地区说，“冬至”前后正是给夏熟作物追施腊肥的季节。不少地区在追肥的同时，还清理了麦田、油菜田的畦沟和结合清理畦沟壅根培土。
    北方麦产区的冬浇基本结束，向麦田浇尿仍在进行中。据山东省12月中旬的统计，追肥浇尿九百二十多万亩，比去年同期多了六倍。
    辽宁、吉林、黑龙江等省今年的打场的结束时间比往年提前，许多地区都在12月中旬下雪以前作完了这件事情。
    我国南部的一些地方还在收获作物。福建省的三百万亩甘薯大部在“冬至”以前收了回来。福建的甘薯今年虽然受到干旱的侵袭，但是收成一般不错。
    在这个阶段里，广东、福建等地正是收割甘蔗的盛期。今年福建、四川的甘蔗收成较好。福建全省平均亩产量仍能达到七千斤；四川省内江专区今年出现了很多亩产万斤蔗的农业社。蔗区的农民，有些在收蔗以后紧接着保护了老蔸。
    ※  ※  ※
    “冬至”以后，北方地区的气温将要逐渐下降，南方地区的温暖气候也将有改变。许多地区已在这个节令以前进行了保护牲畜过冬的准备工作。江苏省江浦县为了争取全县八千三百多头耕牛全部安全过冬，在12月中举行了护畜模范代表会，制定了护牛制度。
    一些牧区，也要从这个阶段起进一步开展防灾过冬、保膘保胎工作。青海省的牧场和牧民一般都作好了接羔育羔的准备。
