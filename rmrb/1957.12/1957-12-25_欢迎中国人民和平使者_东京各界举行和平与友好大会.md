Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 24th: More than two thousand Tokyo citizens and representatives from various circles held a "Peace and Friendship" rally at Kyoritsu Auditorium on the evening of the 23rd to welcome the Chinese Red Cross delegation.

The delegation entered the venue amidst thunderous applause. More than forty Japanese civic groups presented flowers to the delegation. Seventeen organizations presented souvenirs to the delegation. At the meeting, Tokyo Kuni Shrine handed over the souvenir presented to Premier Zhou Enlai to the delegation.

上条贡, Speaker of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting, saying that although diplomatic relations between Japan and China have not yet been restored, the friendly sentiments that have grown up in the long history of the past will not disappear. The economic and other exchanges between the two countries in recent years are the best proof of this.

上条贡 expressed the hope to create more opportunities for friendship and goodwill between Japan and China, so that Japan and China can restore normal relations of free exchanges as in the past.

大谷莹润, Chairman of the Committee for the Commemoration of Chinese Martyrs, said: The work of the Japanese side in returning the remains of the Chinese martyrs means repentance for the war, which should be done by the Japanese government. However, the Japanese government uses the excuse of not restoring diplomatic relations to not assist in this cause. Therefore, this work has been carried out by Japanese people's organizations. 大谷 said that the Japanese people firmly believe that in order not to repeat the mistakes Japan made in the past, and to further strive for world peace and happiness, the Japanese people must resolutely join hands with the Chinese people to work together.

李德全, the head of the delegation, said at the meeting that the delegation was warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in Japan during its visit to various parts of Japan, and deeply felt the profound friendship of the Japanese people towards the Chinese people. As many Japanese friends have said, today, the demand for Sino-Japanese friendship and the early restoration of normal relations between the two countries has become an increasingly high-pitched public opinion of the Japanese people. She said that the Chinese people are willing to restore the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and further develop and consolidate it under the new circumstances.

She then pointed out that the current international situation has undergone fundamental changes, with the forces of peace surpassing the forces of war, and the East wind prevailing over the West wind. Such an international situation is conducive to the establishment of friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence between the Chinese and Japanese people.

She narrated the situation of China's socialist construction and the goals of future struggle. She pointed out that although some imperialist countries do not like and do not recognize China, no force in the world can stop the path forward of the 646 million Chinese people. She said that under such circumstances, the conspiracy of certain imperialist countries and their followers to create "two Chinas" is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. She said that the United States' occupation of China's territory of Taiwan not only threatens China's security at any time, but also threatens peace in the East.

廖承志, the deputy head of the delegation, spoke at the meeting. He first pointed out that the international environment in which China and Japan are located has undergone fundamental changes compared with three years ago. Today, the hopes of American warmongers are difficult to realize. This favorable international environment strengthens our confidence in defending lasting peace. He said that after visiting various parts of Japan, the delegation deeply felt that the feelings of the people of Japan and China for friendship are more deeply rooted than three years ago. The tree of friendship planted on such a foundation cannot be blown down by any typhoon. He also said that at the same time, China's domestic construction has also achieved initial success, and economic and cultural exchanges between China and Japan will be further developed in the future. He pointed out that the delegation visited Japan in such an international and domestic atmosphere, which further strengthened our confidence in Sino-Japanese permanent friendship, peaceful coexistence, and maintaining world lasting peace.

The meeting ended with the audience singing "Tokyo-Beijing" in unison.

    欢迎中国人民和平使者
    东京各界举行和平与友好大会
    据新华社东京24日电　东京二千多市民和各界代表23日晚上在共立讲堂举行“和平与友好”大会，欢迎中国红十字会代表团。
    代表团在雷动般掌声中走进会场。四十多个日本民间团体向代表团献了花。十七个单位向代表团赠送纪念品。东京久国神社在会上把赠给周恩来总理的纪念品交给了代表团。
    东京都议会议长上条贡在会上致欢迎词说，日中两国的邦交虽然还没有恢复，但是，在过去悠久的历史中成长起来的友好情感是不会消失的。最近几年来两国之间的经济以及其他各方面的交流往来，就是最好的证明。
    上条贡表示，希望更多地创造日中两国友好亲善的机会，使日中两国能够恢复像过去那样自由来往的正常关系。
    中国人殉难者慰灵实行委员会委员长大谷莹润说：日本方面送还中国殉难烈士遗骨的工作意味着对战争的忏悔，这应该是日本政府做的事情。可是日本政府以没有恢复邦交为借口不协助这种事业。因此，一直由日本人民团体来进行这项工作。大谷说，日本人民深信，为了不重复日本过去犯过的错误，并且进一步争取世界和平和幸福，日本人民必须与中国人民坚决携起手来共同努力。
    代表团团长李德全在会上说，这次代表团访问日本各地，受到日本各界人民热烈欢迎，深切体会到日本人民对中国人民的深厚友谊。正如许多日本朋友们所说的，今天，要求中日友好，要求早日恢复两国正常关系已经成为日本人民的日益高涨的舆论。她说，中国人民愿意在新的情况下，恢复中日两国人民的传统友谊并且进一步加以发展与巩固。
    她接着指出，目前国际形势发生了根本的变化，和平力量超过了战争势力，东风压倒了西风。这样的国际形势对于中日两国人民建立友好合作、和平共处的关系是有利的。
    她叙述了中国社会主义建设的情况以及今后奋斗的目标，她指出，尽管有些帝国主义国家不喜欢并且不承认中国，但是世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡六亿四千六百万中国人民前进的道路。她说，在这种情况下，某些帝国主义国家及其追随者企图制造“两个中国”的阴谋，这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。她说，美国侵占中国的领土台湾，不仅随时威胁着中国的安全，同时也威胁着东方的和平。
    代表团副团长廖承志在会上讲话。他首先指出，中日两国所处的国际环境同三年前比起来有了根本性变化。今天美国好战分子的希望很难实现了。这种有利的国际环境增强了我们保卫持久和平的信心。他说，代表团在访问日本各地以后深深地感到日中两国人民要求友好的感情比三年前更加根深蒂固了。在这样基础上栽植起来的友谊之树是任何台风也吹不倒的。他还说，在这同时，中国国内的建设也初步取得成就，今后更要发展中日两国之间的经济文化交流。他指出，在这样的国际和国内的气氛中代表团访问了日本，使我们更增强了中日永久友好、和平共处和维护世界持久和平的信心。
    大会在全场齐唱“东京—北京”的歌声中结束。
