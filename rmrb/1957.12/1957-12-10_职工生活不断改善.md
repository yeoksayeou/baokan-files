Workers' living standards are constantly improving
    With the development of industrial and agricultural production, the lives of the broad masses of workers in our country are constantly improving.

　　Labor Employment
    In recent years, the scope of labor employment for workers has expanded. In the seven years from liberation to 1956, the number of workers in the country increased by 16.1 million. If we deduct the personnel from private enterprises that were transformed into state-owned or joint state-private enterprises, and rural cadres, the total number of newly employed workers in the country was 13 million, with an average of about 1.8 million people employed each year. The growth rate of labor employment is unprecedented in old China's history and rare in the world.

　　Wage Income
    Workers' wage income has been continuously increasing. In the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan period, the total wages of workers nationwide increased by 6.9 billion yuan, more than double the amount in 1952. The average monetary wage per worker nationwide was 446 yuan in 1952, which increased to 610 yuan in 1956, an increase of nearly 37% in four years, with an average annual increase of 8.2%, a very rapid growth rate. The actual average wage has also increased significantly. Compared to 1952, the actual wage level of workers in 1956 increased by 27.6%, an average annual growth of 6.3%.

　　Working Conditions
    The state pays great attention to protecting the safety and health of workers in the production process. In the production process, necessary safety devices are installed for the dangerous parts of mechanical operation, boilers, pressure vessels, and electrical equipment. In high-temperature operations and workplaces with toxic substances, ventilation, exhaust, insulation, airtightness, or mechanization measures are generally adopted. From 1953 to 1956, the state spent a total of more than 290 million yuan on improving labor protection facilities. In recent years, workers' working conditions have greatly improved, and the frequency of worker injuries has gradually decreased. If the frequency of worker injuries in 1953 is taken as 100; it was 83.76 in 1954; 79.22 in 1955; and 55.08 in 1956.

　　Living Conditions
    Workers' housing conditions have also improved significantly. From 1952 to 1956, the state built residential areas covering 73.89 million square meters, an average of 3.06 square meters of housing built for each worker (calculated based on the number of workers in 1956). Some local trade union organizations also worked with enterprise administrations to help workers build housing using the "self-construction with public assistance" method. In 1956 alone, 1,678 factories and mines across the country implemented the "self-construction with public assistance" method, with a total of 2.52 million square meters of new housing built throughout the year, and more than 60,000 workers moved into new homes. According to incomplete statistics, the railway, coal mining, and textile industrial systems have helped workers build more than 2.453 million square meters of housing, solving the housing problems of more than 81,000 worker households.

　　职工生活不断改善
    随着工农业生产的发展，我国广大职工群众的生活不断改善。
　　劳动就业
    几年来，工人劳动就业面扩大了。从解放到1956年的七年中，全国共增加职工一千六百一十万人，如果扣除私营企业转为国营和公私合营企业的人员和乡村干部，全国新就业的职工人数共有一千三百万人，平均每年就业人数约为一百八十万人。劳动就业人数的增长速度，是旧中国历史上所没有过的，在世界各国也是少有的。工资收入
    工人的工资收入，不断有所增长。在第一个五年计划时期的前四年中，全国职工工资总额共增加了六十九亿元，1956年为1952年的两倍多。全国职工每人平均货币工资1952年是四百四十六元，1956年提高到六百一十元，四年共提高了近37％，平均每年提高8.2％，增长的速度是很迅速的。实际平均工资也有很大的提高。1956年和1952年比较，职工实际工资水平提高了27.6％，平均每年增长6.3％。
　　劳动条件
    国家对于保护劳动者在生产过程中的安全和健康，寄予极大的关怀。在生产过程中，机械运转的危险部分，锅炉、受压容器、电气设备等都安设了必要的安全装置；在高温作业和有有毒物质的工作场所，一般都采取了通风排气、隔热、密闭化或者机械化等措施。从1953年到1956年，国家用于改善劳动保护设施的经费共有二亿九千多万元。几年来，职工劳动条件有很大改善，职工的负伤频率逐渐下降。如以1953年职工的负伤频率为一百；1954年为八十三点七六；1955年为七十九点二二；1956年为五十五点零八。
　　居住条件
  职工的住宅条件也有了很大的改善。1952年到1956年，国家兴建的住宅面积达七千三百八十九万平方公尺，平均为每一职工（以1956年职工人数计算）兴建的住宅达三点零六平方公尺。有些地区的工会组织还和企业行政一起，用“自建公助”的办法，帮助职工建筑住宅。仅1956年一年，全国就有一千六百七十八个厂矿企业推行了“自建公助”的办法，全年新建的住宅面积共达二百五十二万平方公尺，有六万多名职工搬进了新房。据不完全的统计，铁路、煤矿、纺织三个产业系统已经帮助职工自建了二百四十五万三千多平方公尺住宅，解决了八万一千多户职工的居住问题。
