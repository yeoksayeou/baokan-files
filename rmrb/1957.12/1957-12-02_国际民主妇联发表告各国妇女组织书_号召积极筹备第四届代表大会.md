Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 1st: The Secretariat of the International Democratic Women's Federation issued here on November 30th an open letter from the Executive Bureau of the International Democratic Women's Federation to women's organizations and members of all countries, calling for active preparations for the Fourth Congress of the International Democratic Women's Federation.

The open letter stated: The preparation for the Fourth Congress of the International Democratic Women's Federation, scheduled to be held at the end of May next year, will be carried out in a period filled with great hope. During this period, the forces of peace will be further strengthened, the confidence of the people of the world in their own power to prevent war will be further expanded, and the policy of strength will become increasingly unpopular.

The open letter pointed out that, however, hotbeds of war still exist, and the arms race has reached a dangerous stage. In many countries, living standards have declined. The physical and mental health of young people is being poisoned by an atmosphere that glorifies power and war.

The open letter pointed out that all these situations require women to have the highest vigilance and require them to actively participate in work to defend peace, promote international understanding and friendship, defend and expand their rights, and enable their children to obtain happiness. The letter stated that the leading bodies of the International Democratic Women's Federation proposed "The Role and Responsibilities of Women in the Modern World and the Tasks of the International Democratic Women's Federation" as the main agenda of the Fourth Congress.

　　国际民主妇联发表告各国妇女组织书
　　号召积极筹备第四届代表大会
    据新华社柏林1日电　国际民主妇女联合会书记处11月30日在这里发表了国际民主妇联执行局致一切国家妇女组织和会员的公开信，号召积极展开国际民主妇联第四届代表大会的筹备工作。
    公开信说：定在明年5月底举行的国际民主妇联第四届代表大会，它的筹备将在一个充满巨大希望的时期中进行。在这个时期中，和平力量将进一步加强，世界人民对他们自己的阻止战争力量的信心将进一步扩大，而实力政策将越来越不得人心。
    公开信指出，但是，战争温床仍然存在，而军备竞赛已经达到了一个危险的阶段。在许多国家中，生活水平是降低了。青年们的身心健康受到颂扬强权和战争的气氛的毒害。
    公开信指出，所有这些情形都要求妇女具有最高的警惕，要求她们积极地参与工作，以保卫和平，促进国际谅解和友好，保卫和扩大她们的权利和使她们的子女获得幸福。信中说，国际民主妇联领导机构建议以“妇女在现代世界中的作用和责任以及国际民主妇联的任务”作为第四届代表大会的主要议程。
