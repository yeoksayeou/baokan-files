　　Support Indonesia's Just Struggle

　　Since the current session of the United Nations General Assembly, manipulated by the imperialist bloc, unreasonably rejected the joint proposal of eighteen Asian-African countries and Bolivia demanding that the Netherlands renegotiate with Indonesia on the West Irian issue, Indonesia's struggle to recover West Irian has entered a new climax. With the active support of the people across the country, the Indonesian government has taken a series of measures, such as taking over Dutch-owned enterprises in Indonesia. Currently, people from all walks of life in Indonesia are launching a massive movement against Dutch colonialism. This fully demonstrates the will and strength of the Indonesian people to fight for the realization of their national territorial integrity and sovereignty.

　　West Irian is an integral part of the legitimate territory of the Republic of Indonesia. Whether from a geographical, historical, political, economic, or ethnic relationship perspective, it has an inseparable connection with the rest of Indonesia. Before World War II, West Irian was included in the territory of "Dutch East Indies" and was one of the administrative regions of "Dutch East Indies." However, when the Netherlands negotiated the issue of "transfer of sovereignty" with Indonesia at the end of 1949, it refused to transfer West Irian, continued to implement colonial rule in West Irian, and used this area as a base for organizing and supporting the subversion of the Republic of Indonesia. The Indonesian government has consistently strived to resolve the West Irian issue through negotiations, but due to the Dutch government's deliberate occupation of West Irian, each negotiation ended without result. Finally, in 1952, the Dutch government even declared its refusal to hold further negotiations with Indonesia on the West Irian issue.

　　After the Netherlands refused to negotiate, Indonesia submitted the West Irian issue to the United Nations more than once, requesting the United Nations to urge the Netherlands to resume negotiations. However, under the control of the imperialist bloc, the United Nations repeatedly rejected Indonesia's proposals. Therefore, after the current session of the United Nations General Assembly once again rejected the proposal on the West Irian issue, it is entirely justified and reasonable for the Indonesian government and people to take practical measures to safeguard national independence and sovereignty in order to strengthen the struggle to recover West Irian. Facts have once again proved that the United Nations is unreliable. As long as the United Nations organization is still under the control of the imperialist bloc, it cannot play a role in safeguarding the independence of countries and world peace. Harsh facts show that the realization of the demand for the recovery of West Irian is not determined by the United Nations but by the struggle of the Indonesian people themselves. As President Sukarno pointed out in a recent speech in Surabaya: "This issue must be resolved here in Indonesia, not in Washington, The Hague, or the United Nations."

　　For their own colonial interests, the US and British ruling groups have adopted various means to support the Netherlands' occupation of West Irian. Now they are wantonly slandering, instigating, and intimidating the legitimate measures taken by the Indonesian government against Dutch colonialists and the patriotic actions taken by the Indonesian people to support the government, and are actively engaged in conspiracies of interference. The Permanent Representative Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization held a special meeting on December 7 to discuss the so-called "situation in Indonesia," which is a blatant interference in Indonesia's independence and sovereignty. In particular, the United States has this time torn off its mask of feigned "neutrality" on the West Irian issue and openly come forward to defend Dutch colonial interests. The US Ambassador to Indonesia, Allison, has twice expressed his "concern" about the situation in Indonesia to the Indonesian government in person, warning Indonesia to "act with caution," and insisted that Americans in Indonesia also felt "threatened." Dulles openly and arrogantly demanded at a press conference on December 10 that the actions of the Indonesian government should be "restrained." Dulles also dispatched Maine, the chief of the Southwest Pacific Section of the State Department and an important figure in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, to Jakarta to conduct so-called "intelligence gathering" activities. US news agencies and newspapers have also fabricated rumors that Indonesia's economy may be "paralyzed" and that internal "chaos and division" will be caused, creating excuses for further interference.

　　The reason why the United States wants to interfere arbitrarily in Indonesia's struggle to recover West Irian is because it has obvious ambitions for West Irian. The United States regards West Irian as a source of its overseas profit-grabbing; 60% of West Irian's oil exploitation is controlled by US monopoly capital. More importantly, the United States regards West Irian as an important military base for itself and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in the Southwest Pacific. As early as 1952, the United States obtained the consent of the Netherlands and obtained priority in establishing military bases in West Irian. According to the Indian "Delhi Times," last year the Dutch government agreed that the armed forces of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization jointly use the naval base built near Sorong Port in West Irian. Therefore, the United States, proceeding from its aim of instigating aggressive wars, has repeatedly opposed the return of West Irian to Indonesia, which firmly implements an independent and autonomous policy and does not participate in military blocs. Baldwin, a military commentator for the "New York Times," once bluntly said that for the United States to agree to Indonesia's recovery of West Irian "would be strategically insane."

　　The interference activities of imperialist countries have aroused great indignation among the Indonesian people. The Indonesian embassies in the United States and the United Kingdom have successively issued statements opposing the interference of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other countries in Indonesia's struggle against Dutch colonialism. The Indonesian news agency accused the United States' actions of being "an unreasonable interference in Indonesia's firm measures against the Netherlands to shatter the shackles of colonialism." The "East Star" newspaper in Jakarta appropriately pointed out that "the attitude of the United States shows that it has become a protector of the Netherlands."

　　The Indonesian people's struggle to strive for their sovereignty and territorial integrity and defend national independence is not isolated. This struggle is part of the Asian-African people's struggle against colonialist oppression and for peace. The people of Asian and African countries and peace-loving people all over the world stand on the side of the Indonesian people. The Chinese government and people firmly support the just struggle of the Indonesian government and people. In the joint statement issued by the premiers of China and Indonesia in April 1955, it was affirmed that they expressed deep sympathy and support for the efforts of either country to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Premier Zhou Enlai recently expressed the Chinese people's sympathy and support for the Indonesian people once again in a conversation with a reporter from the Indonesian Antara News Agency. Although the Indonesian people's struggle against colonialism and to safeguard national independence will encounter various difficulties and setbacks, we believe that the Indonesian people, with the support of the people of the world, strengthening national unity, and resolutely carrying out the struggle, will surely be able to smash the imperialist conspiracy of interference, and will surely be able to strive for the return of West Irian to the embrace of the motherland.

### 支持印度尼西亚的正义斗争

　　支持印度尼西亚的正义斗争
    自从本届联合国大会，在帝国主义集团的操纵下，无理否决了十八个亚非国家和玻利维亚联合提出的要求荷兰就西伊里安问题同印度尼西亚重新谈判的提案以后，印度尼西亚收复西伊里安的斗争进入了一个新的高潮。印度尼西亚政府在全国人民的积极支持下，采取了接管荷兰在印度尼西亚的企业等一系列的措施。现在印度尼西亚各阶层人民正掀起一次声势浩大的反对荷兰殖民主义的运动。这充分显示出印度尼西亚人民为实现自己国家领土和主权完整的要求而斗争的意志和力量。
    西伊里安是印度尼西亚共和国合法领土的一部分。无论从地理上、历史上、政治上、经济上和民族关系上来看，都同印度尼西亚其余部分有着不可分割的联系。在第二次世界大战之前，西伊里安曾被包括在“荷属东印度”的版图内，是
  “荷属东印度”的行政区域之一。但是，当1949年底荷兰同印度尼西亚谈判“移交主权”问题时，却拒绝移交西伊里安，继续在西伊里安实行殖民统治，并利用这个地区作为组织和支持颠覆印度尼西亚共和国的基地。印度尼西亚政府一贯争取以谈判方式解决西伊里安问题，但是由于荷兰政府蓄意霸占西伊里安，以致每次谈判均无结果。最后，荷兰政府在1952年竟然宣布拒绝再就西伊里安问题和印度尼西亚举行谈判。
    印度尼西亚在荷兰拒绝谈判以后，曾经不止一次将西伊里安问题提交联合国，要求联合国敦促荷兰恢复谈判。但是，联合国在帝国主义集团的把持下，一再否决了印度尼西亚的提案。因此，当本届联合国大会又一次否决了关于西伊里安问题的提案之后，印度尼西亚政府和人民采取了维护民族独立和国家主权的实际措施，以加强收复西伊里安的斗争，这是完全正当的和合理的。事实又一次证明，联合国是靠不住的，只要联合国组织仍在帝国主义集团的控制之下，它就不能发挥维护各国独立和世界和平的作用。严酷的事实表明，实现收复西伊里安的要求，不是决定于联合国而是决定于印度尼西亚人民自己的斗争。正如苏加诺总统最近在泗水发表的演说中所指出的：“这个问题要在印度尼西亚这里解决，而不是在华盛顿、海牙或者是联合国解决”。
    美英统治集团为了自身的殖民利益，采取各种方式支持荷兰对西伊里安的霸占。现在它们对印度尼西亚政府所采取的反对荷兰殖民主义者的正当措施和印度尼西亚人民所采取的支持政府的爱国行动，横加诽谤、挑拨和恫吓，并且积极进行干涉的阴谋活动。北大西洋集团常任代表理事会于12月7日举行特别会议，讨论所谓“印度尼西亚的局势”问题，这是对印度尼西亚独立和主权的露骨的干涉。特别是美国，这一次更撕下了它在西伊里安问题上伪装“中立”的假面具，公开出面维护荷兰的殖民利益。美国驻印度尼西亚大使艾利逊曾两次向印度尼西亚政府当面表示对印度尼西亚的局势感到“忧虑”，警告印度尼西亚要“小心行事”，并硬说在印度尼西亚的美国人也感受到了“威胁”。杜勒斯在12月10日的记者招待会上公然狂妄地要求印度尼西亚政府的行动应该“克制”。杜勒斯还派遣了东南亚条约组织的重要人员、国务院西南太平洋科的科长麦恩到雅加达去进行所谓“搜集情报”的活动。美国的通讯社和报刊也大肆捏造印度尼西亚的经济可能“瘫痪”、内部将引起“混乱和分裂”等谰言，为进一步的干涉制造借口。
    美国所以要蛮横地干涉印度尼西亚收复西伊里安的斗争，是因为它对西伊里安抱有明显的野心。美国把西伊里安作为它在海外掠夺利润的一个来源，西伊里安的石油开采量的60％控制在美国垄断资本的手里。更主要的，美国把西伊里安当作它和东南亚条约组织在西南太平洋的重要军事基地。早在1952年，美国就得到荷兰的同意，取得了在西伊里安建立军事基地的优先权。据印度“德里时报”的揭露，去年荷兰政府已同意东南亚条约组织的武装部队共同使用建立在西伊里安梭弄港附近的海军基地。因此，美国从它策动侵略战争的目的出发，一再反对西伊里安归还给坚决执行独立自主和不参加军事集团政策的印度尼西亚。“纽约时报”军事评论员鲍德温曾经露骨地说，美国要同意印度尼西亚收回西伊里安，“就是在战略上发疯了”。
    帝国主义国家的干涉活动已经引起了印度尼西亚人民的极大愤慨。印度尼西亚驻美国和英国的大使馆已先后发表声明，反对北大西洋公约组织和其他国家干涉印度尼西亚反对荷兰殖民主义的斗争。印度尼西亚通讯社指责美国的行动是“对印度尼西亚为粉碎殖民主义的枷锁而对荷兰采取坚定措施的无理干涉”。雅加达的“东星报”恰当地指出，“美国的态度表明它已经成为荷兰的保护者”。
    印度尼西亚人民争取自己主权和领土完整、保卫民族独立的斗争不是孤立的。这个斗争是亚非各国人民反对殖民主义压迫和争取和平运动的一部分。亚非各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民都站在印度尼西亚人民一边。中国政府和人民坚决支持印度尼西亚政府和人民的正义斗争。中国和印度尼西亚两国总理在1955年4月发表的联合声明中就确定，他们对两国中任何一国维护自己主权和领土完整的努力表示深切的同情和支持。周恩来总理最近在同印度尼西亚安塔拉通讯社记者的谈话中，又一次表示了中国人民对印度尼西亚人民的同情和支持。印度尼西亚人民反对殖民主义和维护民族独立的斗争尽管会遇到种种困难和曲折，但是，我们相信，印度尼西亚人民，在全世界人民的支持下，加强民族团结，坚决进行斗争，一定能够粉碎帝国主义的干涉阴谋，一定能够争取西伊里安重返祖国的怀抱。
