Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 26th: Japanese representative Professor Ikuo Yasui said at the first plenary session of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference on the afternoon of the 26th that the United States is turning many of its bases in Japan into bases for preparing for atomic warfare. He suggested that the conference issue a strong appeal to the world demanding the prohibition of nuclear weapons. He suggested urging governments to immediately and unconditionally ban nuclear weapons, and to oppose the transportation of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles to Asian and African countries.

Professor Yasui Ikuo requested that the Fourth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament be held in August 1958, the anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He also suggested efforts to promote a meeting of the heads of government of Asian and African countries in the near future.

Yasui Ikuo is the Director-General of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. In his report entitled "Let Us Strengthen the United Action of Asian and African People to Ban Nuclear Weapons," he said: "On Okinawa Island, which is under American rule, 'Nike' missile bases used with atomic warheads have already been established, and missiles have been equipped."

He denounced Dulles' so-called "limited atomic war" plan advocated in a recent issue of "Foreign Affairs," and pointed out that "This situation in Japan is not only a serious danger to the Japanese people, but also a great threat to world peace, especially to the security of Asia." He said that the purpose of this plan of the United States "is primarily to explode atomic and hydrogen bombs over the heads of colored people."

Professor Yasui Ikuo, in introducing Japan's anti-nuclear weapons movement, said that as of December 10, 1957, more than 34 million Japanese people had signed petitions demanding the prohibition of hydrogen and atomic bombs.

    日本代表建议大会向全世界发出呼吁
    促使各国政府立即禁止核武器
    据新华社开罗26日电　日本代表安井郁教授26日下午在亚非团结大会第一次全体会议上说，美国正在把它在日本的许多基地变为准备原子战争的基地。他建议大会向全世界发出要求禁止核武器的强烈呼吁。他建议敦促各国政府立即无条件禁止核武器，并且反对把核武器和弹道导弹运到亚非国家去。
    安井郁教授要求在1958年8月广岛和长崎遭受原子弹轰炸周年纪念日举行第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会。他还建议努力促使亚非国家的政府首脑在最近的将来举行会议。
    安井郁是日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长。他在他的题为“让我们加强亚非人民争取禁止核武器的一致行动”的报告中说：“在美国统治下的冲绳岛已经建立了和原子弹头一起使用的‘奈克’导弹基地，并且已经配备了导弹。”
    他斥责了杜勒斯在最近一期“外交季刊”上鼓吹的所谓“有限原子战争”的计划，并且指出，“日本的这种情况不仅对日本人民是严重的危险，而且对世界和平、特别对亚洲的安全也是莫大的威胁。”他说，美国这种计划的目的，“首先是要在有色人民的头上爆炸原子弹和氢弹”。
    安井郁教授在介绍日本的反对核武器运动时说，到1957年12月10日为止，签名要求禁止氢弹和原子弹的日本人民已经达到三千四百多万人。
