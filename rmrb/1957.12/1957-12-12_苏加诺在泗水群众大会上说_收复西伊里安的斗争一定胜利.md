Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 11th. A mass rally of hundreds of thousands of people supporting the struggle to recover West Irian was held in Surabaya, Indonesia, this morning. Indonesian President Sukarno addressed the rally, saying that the struggle to recover West Irian is a just struggle. A just struggle is bound to be victorious.

In his speech, Sukarno once again stated that the place to wage the struggle to recover West Irian is not in Washington, but in Indonesia. The liberation of Indonesian territory, West Irian, must rely on the strength of the Indonesian people themselves.

Sukarno said that in the United Nations, Indonesia did not get two-thirds of the total votes, but Indonesia received the support of forty-two countries, whose populations account for half of the world's total population.

Sukarno also emphasized that with the support of the People's Republic of China, which has a population of 600 million, outside the United Nations, the strength supporting the struggle of the Indonesian people is even greater.

President Sukarno called on the Indonesian people to carry out the struggle to liberate West Irian under the unified leadership of the government.

The ambassadors of the People's Republic of China, Yugoslavia, India, Afghanistan, and Malaya to Indonesia were invited to attend the conference. These countries have expressed their support for the struggle of the Indonesian people.

    苏加诺在泗水群众大会上说
    收复西伊里安的斗争一定胜利
    新华社雅加达11日电　印度尼西亚泗水市今天早上举行一个有数十万人参加的支持收复西伊里安的斗争的群众大会。印度尼西亚总统苏加诺在会上发表演讲说，收复西伊里安的斗争是一个正义的斗争。正义的斗争是一定胜利的。
    苏加诺在演讲中再一次说明，进行收复西伊里安斗争的地方不是在华盛顿，而是在印度尼西亚，解放印度尼西亚的领土西伊里安，要依靠印度尼西亚人民自己的力量。
    苏加诺说，在联合国，印度尼西亚得不到总票数的三分之二，但是，印度尼西亚获得了四十二个国家的支持，这些国家的人口占世界总人口的一半。
    苏加诺还强调指出，得到联合国以外的有六亿人口的中华人民共和国的支持，支持印度尼西亚人民的斗争的力量就更大了。
    苏加诺总统要求印度尼西亚人民在政府的统一领导下进行解放西伊里安的斗争。
    应邀参加大会的有中华人民共和国、南斯拉夫、印度、阿富汗和马来亚等国的驻印度尼西亚大使。这些国家曾经表示支持印度尼西亚人民的斗争。
