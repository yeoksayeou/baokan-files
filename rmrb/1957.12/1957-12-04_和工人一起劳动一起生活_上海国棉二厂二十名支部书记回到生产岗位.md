Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 3rd: The Chinese Communist Party Committee of Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 2 recently approved the request of all workshop Party branch secretaries, allowing them to return to their production posts as non-detached branch secretaries.

　　The twenty workshop branch secretaries of this factory made this request at a symposium convened by the factory's Party committee on November 30th. These branch secretaries were originally production workers, and they deeply felt that after leaving production to focus solely on Party affairs, their connection with the masses was not as close as it was before they left production. During the rectification movement, the masses raised many sharp opinions about the Party organization and full-time Party affairs cadres, many of which criticized the branch secretaries' ideological style of being detached from the masses. When the factory Party committee convened the workshop branch secretaries to discuss how to improve branch work, many branch secretaries reflected: Before we left production, we went to work and got off work with the workers, ate and labored together, and the workers were willing to tell us what they were thinking; after we left production, we had fewer opportunities to get close to the masses, and it was difficult to hear their heartfelt words. Some said: Once the branch secretary leaves production, the work that some administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres and branch committee members should do is often pushed to the branch secretary. In this way, the collective leadership role of the branch committee and the organizational role of the entire Party cannot be well-developed, and the Party's combat effectiveness will be weakened. They unanimously believed that to improve the Party's political and ideological work, branch secretaries should return to the masses, return to production, and labor and live with the masses.

　　Now, all the Party branch secretaries of the workshops in the State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 2, except for a few individuals who need to be delayed slightly due to work needs, most of the branch secretaries will return to their production posts this week. Ma Yongxian, the branch secretary of the fine yarn workshop of the third spinning workshop, who participated in production as an oiler as early as November 29th, was welcomed by all the workers in the workshop. The Party branch committee members and Party group leaders of this workshop all expressed that they would work together to do a better job of the branch's work in the future.

### 和工人一起劳动一起生活  上海国棉二厂二十名支部书记回到生产岗位

　　和工人一起劳动一起生活
    上海国棉二厂二十名支部书记回到生产岗位
    新华社上海3日电　上海国棉二厂的中共党委，最近批准全体车间党支部书记的请求，让他们回到生产岗位上去做一个不脱产的支部书记。
    这个厂的二十个车间支部书记是在11月30日工厂党委召开的一次座谈会上提出这个请求的。这些支部书记原来都是生产工人，他们深深感到脱离生产专做党务工作以后，和群众的联系不如脱产以前那样密切了。在整风运动中，群众对党组织和专职的党务干部提出了许多尖锐的意见，其中很多意见就是批评支部书记脱离群众的思想作风。工厂党委在召集车间支部书记讨论怎样改进支部工作的时候，许多支部书记反映：以前没有脱产时，我们和工人一起上班下班，同吃同劳动，工人有什么思想都肯告诉我们；脱离生产以后，和群众接近的机会少了，他们的知心话也难得听到了。有的说：支部书记一脱产，往往有些行政、工会、团干部和支部委员们应做的工作也推给支部书记，这样，支部委员会的集体领导作用和全党的组织作用不能很好发挥，党的战斗力就会减弱。他们一致认为：要改进党的政治思想工作，应当让支部书记回到群众中去，回到生产中去，和群众一起劳动，一起生活。
    现在，国棉二厂所有车间的党支部书记，除了个别人因为工作需要稍缓下去以外，绝大多数支部书记都将在本周内回到生产岗位。早在11月29日就参加生产当了加油工的三纺工场细纱车间支部书记马永贤，受到全车间职工的欢迎，这个车间的党支部委员、党小组长都表示今后要共同把支部工作搞得更好。
