Anguo and Boye

By our reporter Jin Feng

"Originally sister counties, why so far apart?
One will cross the Yellow River, the other still halfway there!
Whip the horse and gallop, the future is within reach;
Procrastinate and procrastinate again, and you'll end up on the banks of the Yangtze!"

The above doggerel was composed during the bumpy bus ride back after my recent trip to Anguo and Boye, reflecting on what I had seen and heard in the two counties. If the reader wants to know the details, please listen to the following explanation.

(1) About to cross the Yellow River – 464 catties, still halfway there – 240 catties

Anguo and Boye are both located in the central part of Hebei Province. The two counties are closely adjacent, Anguo in the west and Boye in the east, and the terrain is very flat. The Xiaoyi River runs across the northern part of both counties; the Sha River, Zi River, Xiaotang River, and Xiaoqing River flow through the southern part of Anguo, converging into the Zhulong River, which flows into the southern part of Boye. Both counties are cotton-producing areas, with one-third of the land planted with cotton, mostly concentrated in the yellow sandy loam soil in the north. The terrain there is slightly higher, making it susceptible to spring drought. The terrain in the southern part of the two counties is low-lying, with black, sticky, and fertile soil, suitable for growing grain. However, it is also prone to autumn floods. The average annual rainfall is around 600 mm, mostly concentrated in July and August, so spring drought and autumn flood phenomena are very likely to occur. Grain production is not high, and they have historically been grain-deficient counties. The first year of the Five-Year Plan – 1952 – was a bumper year. Anguo's grain yield per mu was 330.9 catties, and cotton (lint) yield per mu was 45.6 catties; Boye's grain yield per mu was 334.9 catties, and cotton yield per mu was 57.4 catties; both grain and cotton yields were at the middle and upper levels in Hebei Province. In 1954 and 1956, there were floods, and both counties were severely affected, with very little harvest. The years 1953 and 1955 were also not strong, and the harvests were not large. In these four years, the grain and cotton yields of the two counties were not as good as in 1952, and the state had to allocate tens of millions of catties of grain every year.

From the above simple situation, it can be seen that Anguo and Boye are very similar in terms of natural conditions – soil, geology, climate, terrain, rivers, crops, and even production levels and historical evolution. They are a pair of sister counties with extremely similar destinies, except that Anguo has a slightly larger area and a slightly larger population. Anguo has a cultivated area of 567,000 mu and a population of over 240,000. Boye has a cultivated area of over 375,000 mu and a population of over 145,000. In the past five years, they have together endured the heavy blow of "three disasters in five years" and have jointly reached the final year of the Five-Year Plan.

In 1957, the situation changed drastically!

Anguo County's grain yield per mu this year is 464.9 catties, an increase of 40.4% over the highest historical yield in 1952. It has reached the target of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ten years ahead of schedule, changing the historical face of grain deficiency. Previously, the state had to supply 20 to 30 million catties of grain every year, but this year it sold 26 million catties of surplus grain to the state. The cotton yield is 50 catties per mu, an increase of about 9% compared to 1952.

Boye's cotton is growing well, with 60 catties per mu, which also meets the requirements of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program. However, the grain yield is only 240 catties per mu, about 30% lower than in 1952, and the state still needs to supply 20 million catties of grain this year.

Two adjacent counties, with roughly the same production conditions and similar historical situations, why is one grain yield per mu about to cross the Yellow River and reach the target of 500 catties per mu, while the other is still far from the 500-catties mark?

(2) In the face of the countercurrent…

The story has to start in 1956.

In the spring of 1956, with the advent of the high tide of cooperativization, Anguo and Boye, like many other places in the country, set off a high tide of agricultural production centered on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation. Anguo dug 187 mechanized wells and more than 4,500 brick wells. Boye also dug 10 mechanized wells and more than 3,000 brick wells. Both counties accumulated more than 10,000 catties of fertilizer per mu.

Unexpectedly, in the autumn of 1956, a flood washed away thousands of newly dug wells in Anguo and Boye, destroyed thousands of newly purchased waterwheels, submerged hundreds of thousands of mu of crops, and collapsed tens of thousands of houses. Tens of thousands of disaster victims were homeless, and hundreds of thousands of disaster victims lacked food and clothing.

In the first year of cooperativization, facing such a cruel blow, a small typhoon blew up in the countryside, and some wavering rich middle peasants clamored that cooperativization had no superiority, that the leadership in 1956 had been rash, that water conservancy had been rash, and that fertilizer accumulation had also been messed up... Landlords and rich peasants took the opportunity to carry out extensive activities, jointly cursing and attacking the leadership of the Communist Party. They also added the responsibility for the irresistible natural disasters to the head of the Communist Party. At that time, some opportunists also echoed them. The masses were ideologically confused, the cadres were passive and pessimistic, and agricultural production suffered serious difficulties.

In the face of such a countercurrent, should we bravely move forward, or should we retreat timidly?

The leaders of Anguo County chose the first path. They clarified right and wrong from the viewpoint of class analysis, clarified the confused thinking, and unified the party's understanding of the work in 1956: the achievements were huge and main, the shortcomings were secondary and could be overcome (mainly that some agricultural technology reform measures were not adapted to local conditions, there were some coercive orders in the work, and the production targets were too high and unrealistic, etc.); and they made all the cadres firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party, relying on the strength and wisdom of the masses, the cooperative could be consolidated, the disaster could be overcome, and production would surely leap forward. They concentrated the strength of the whole party, organized the masses, and launched production; at the same time, they carried out in-depth political and ideological education extensively inside and outside the party, and forcefully put forward the political mobilization slogan of "Don't bow your head, don't be afraid of difficulties, get up when you fall, straighten your back and keep working, work happily last year, and keep working this year" to the whole party and the whole people. In political mobilization, special attention was paid to relying on backbones. The Anguo County Committee of the Communist Party of China issued more than 2,000 letters to old cadres and old party members who had experienced the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, inspiring them to recall past struggles, compare them with today's difficulties, and asking them to stand at the forefront of the masses and lead the masses to overcome difficulties. The broad masses were widely educated on the superiority of advanced cooperativization, and through recollection and comparison, everyone's confidence in overcoming disasters and striving for bumper harvests was strengthened. Through summarizing the work, more than 3,000 old party members, old cadres, and socialist activists were commended, and 140 cadres with negative work attitudes and 270 rich middle peasants with wavering emotions were educated and criticized. Through this series of work, the positive forces of all aspects were mobilized, and the enthusiasm and courage of the broad masses of cadres and the masses were boosted. After recalling the scenes of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Lu Panxin and other old party members from Nanloudi Village said indignantly: "At that time, we tucked our heads in our waists and never bowed our heads in front of the enemy. Now we must never fall down in the face of the flood!" Zheng Laoquan, Chen Ruinian and other 170 old party members in Yucun Township expressed their attitude, saying: "We still have to work like we did when we were digging tunnels in the past!" Because the leadership of Anguo County was firm and clear in its thinking and forged ahead bravely, they not only led the county to successfully overcome the disaster, but also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in 1957 in the midst of difficulties.

Unfortunately, the leaders of Boye County were not like this. They could not resist the impact of the countercurrent. When the rumor of "rash advance in 1956" came from various places, they did not maintain a clear head and mistakenly regarded the cries of only some wavering rich middle peasants as the opinion of the masses. They were dragged back by backward thinking. When formulating this year's production targets and various production measures, they only paid attention to the difficult aspects of production in the disaster area and underestimated the potential of the masses. The production targets were set low (the grain yield per mu was only 220 catties, while Anguo's target this year was 400 catties), and the measures to increase production were not specific. Especially when criticizing some deviations that occurred in the production upsurge of 1956, the enthusiasm of the masses was dampened. A misconception was created among cadres and the masses that "the more stable the production, the better." This has caused production to stagnate. Some cooperatives originally had water conservancy conditions, and the masses also asked to increase production, but the cadres relaxed their leadership and reduced production.

(3) Two different situations

Under the guidance of two different leadership ideologies, the production in Anguo and Boye this year showed two different situations.

First of all, in terms of wheat sowing and management. Because last year's flood was serious, in order to shorten the disaster period and strive for a bumper harvest, the provincial and regional committees decided that each county should first grab a handful and plant more wheat. Anguo County put forward the call to "overcome all difficulties and complete the wheat planting task more, faster, and better." The county mobilized 120,000 laborers and completed the rush planting of 260,000 mu of wheat fields in 25 days. During the tense period of wheat planting, in the riverine area in the south, the water was still surrounding the villages, and the livestock could not go down to the ground; in order to save time, the areas where the land was wet and difficult to cultivate were completely hoed and ploughed by human power. Around the Spring Festival, another upsurge of rolling and harrowing wheat, covering manure, and irrigating urine was launched to strengthen wheat field management. In early April, there was a heavy snowfall, and the wheat was generally damaged by freezing, pouring cold water on the production enthusiasm of the masses. The masses said: "Snow in February, the wheat is瘪 (bie - shriveled), let alone snow in March (according to the lunar calendar)?" The leadership visited old farmers, sought experience, and affirmed that as long as they followed up with water and fertilizer and strengthened management, the wheat could be guaranteed a bumper harvest; at the same time, they organized and mobilized the masses to launch an upsurge of anti-disaster and production protection centered on topdressing, watering, and deep hoeing. In less than half a month, 174,000 mu of high and dry wheat land was universally rushed and watered once, and 100,000 mu of low and wet wheat land was universally hoeed once or twice. In order to comprehensively increase production, a campaign to rush to manage "secondary wheat" (part of the wheat planted in low-alkali land and poorly grown) was vigorously launched, and fertilizer was universally applied and watered to 80,000 mu of secondary wheat throughout the county in six days. During the wheat booting period, 200 catties of human manure and urine were poured per mu. As a result, wheat land that could only harvest 50 or 60 catties per mu in previous years achieved an average yield of 125 catties per mu this year. More than 260,000 mu of wheat fields throughout the county were topdressed two to three times and watered three to five times, achieving an average yield of 162 catties per mu.

Boye County also planted 190,000 mu of wheat. However, due to the right-leaning conservatism of the leadership's thinking, they only saw the difficulties in front of them and were busy dealing with the difficulties in front of them. Although they also wanted to grab a handful in wheat planting, they only wanted to solve the problem of spring rations in their minds. Therefore, they only attached importance to the leadership of sideline production and did not concentrate their attention on agricultural production. The quantity of wheat planted was not small (almost 70% of the total grain arable land), but the quality was very poor. In many places, wheat was planted without turning the land, resulting in reduced wheat production. More than 70,000 mu of secondary wheat were not strengthened management, resulting in only 30 to 50 catties per mu. After the snow in April, the wheat seedlings were severely hit, but the work of topdressing, insect removal, and watering did not keep up. In many places on the border between Anguo and Boye, wheat fields were next to each other. Anguo's wheat had large ears and plump grains, and grew heavily. Boye's wheat, however, grew sparsely. The people said, "Look at the wheat in Anguo, why does our wheat grow like that?" When it came to harvesting, the wheat harvest order in Boye was also very bad, some people even robbed and stole, and a lot was lost on the ground. An elementary school teacher picked up six dou of wheat during the holidays. In this way, Boye planted 190,000 mu of wheat this year, but only harvested 170,000 mu, with only 90 catties per mu (140 catties in 1952). The wheat alone reduced production by more than 10 million catties compared to 1952.

The leaders of Anguo County were not frightened by the fallacy of "the work in 1956 was a rash advance," and still insisted on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation. This spring, the county carried out a universal inspection of all water wells and waterwheels, and a total of 287 mechanized wells were dredged and repaired, 3,870 brick wells were repaired, 420 cone wells were repaired, 4,730 waterwheels were repaired, 204 water pumps were installed, and 343 new waterwheels were purchased. At the same time, more than 81,000 mu of land was leveled, and the area for irrigation was restored and expanded to 417,400 mu. This played a paramount role in this year's drought resistance, production protection, and ensuring bumper harvests. This year, the total sporadic rainfall was only more than 200 mm. In order to ensure the autumn harvest, Anguo County successively carried out the "Drought Resistance Assault Ten Days," "Hard Work Forty Days," and a continuous watering assault campaign for nearly 100 days, and the autumn crops were matured entirely by manpower and animal power. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, the masses were mobilized to carry out regular fertilizer accumulation work, and the quality was emphasized, reaching 10,000 catties of fertilizer per mu.

Boye County did not dare to mention water conservancy this year after inspecting the "rash advance" in the spring. More than half of the 3,000 wells dug in 1956 were damaged, and they were not repaired this spring. No new wells were dug at all. Many waterwheels were smashed and destroyed, and they were not repaired in time, let alone buying new ones. The land that had been flooded was not leveled either. Therefore, after the drought occurred this year, the leadership was completely in a passive position. It lacked water wells and waterwheels to fight the drought. The land that had already grown crops could not be leveled, and it was not easy to water. As a result, the major autumn crops – corn, sorghum, summer sweet potatoes, and millet – all suffered reduced production. Boye also accumulated less fertilizer, with an average of only 4,000 catties per mu, which was much less than Anguo.

In addition, Anguo selected improved varieties for 70% of the crops throughout the county, ensuring increased production. Outstanding examples include multi-spike sorghum, which increased production by an average of 107%. Planting more high-yield crops – sweet potatoes – also played an important role in increasing production. More than 123,000 mu of sweet potatoes were planted throughout the county, accounting for 15.2% of the grain crop area, and the total output reached more than 79.9 million catties (converted to grain), accounting for 49% of the total grain output. Expanding the replanting area also had a significant effect on increasing production. This year, Anguo's replanting index reached 142%. Summer-sown crops were planted on 90% of the wheat fields, and the average production increased by 60% from the first crop. The county also eliminated 14,000 mu of idle land, increasing grain by more than 4 million catties.

The varieties of wheat in Boye were uneven, especially too few high-yield crops were planted, and only 30,000 mu of sweet potatoes were planted, only a quarter of Anguo's. In terms of cotton, Boye has grasped it relatively tightly, so there is a record of 60 catties per mu.

(4) Accept experience and lessons, and make a great leap forward in production next year

Now, on the basis of this year's increased production, Anguo requires a grain yield of 550 catties per mu next year, striving for 650 catties, and a cotton yield of 80 catties per mu. Their slogan is: "Cross the Yellow River and head for the Yangtze." A production upsurge centered on water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and wheat field management, which is more in-depth than in 1956, has already appeared. The county party secretaries have gone to the countryside. The fields are full of lights at night. Waterwheels are turning, mechanized wells are being dug, and the soil in the fields is being turned more than a foot deep. Every night, there are 60,000 to 70,000 men and women hoeing their happy tomorrow with big hoes.

Boye County is also speeding up to catch up. Their production targets for next year are: a grain yield of 450 catties per mu and a cotton yield of 70 catties per mu. The main measures are: changing to high-yield crops and developing water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation. The potential for changing to high-yield crops is great. Next year, the area of sweet potatoes will increase from 30,000 mu this year to 70,000 mu, and the area of millet will increase from 20,000 mu to 40,000 mu. It is also necessary to plant 21,000 mu of multi-spike sorghum. In terms of water conservancy, 200 mechanized wells and 1,000 brick wells will be dug, 70,000 mu of low-lying land will be transformed, the Xiaoyi River will be dredged, enclosure fields will be built, embankments will be built, drainage ditches and water storage pits will be dug, and a pumping station will be built on the Zhulong River, striving to achieve water conservancy throughout the county next year. The accumulation of fertilizer should reach 2.6 million carts, an average of 7,000 catties per mu. It is also necessary to improve the soil, pull sand to cover alkali, vigorously promote improved varieties, and do a good job in wheat management and winter irrigation. The masses are very busy with production, digging wells, repairing canals, pulling manure, and watering wheat. The leadership still thinks that it is grasping tightly and is prepared to be scolded. But the masses are so busy and so tired, and they are still very satisfied, saying: "This is what it should be like. It would have been right to have such a strong momentum this spring!" They also criticized the county party committee: "If we had worked hard this spring and repaired the old wells, our grain would not be 240 catties, but at least 300 catties!"

Judging from the current situation, Anguo's momentum is still greater than Boye's. This can be seen from the progress of water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, watering wheat, and hoeing wheat in the two counties, as well as from the comparison of the labor force mobilized for winter production in the two counties. Anguo currently mobilizes more than 115,000 laborers every day, with an attendance rate of more than 100% (the county has more than 108,000 laborers), while Boye only mobilizes 77.6% of the labor force.

Writing here, the reader should be fully aware of the content of the doggerel at the beginning. Boye really needs to work harder to catch up with Anguo. Otherwise, when Boye catches up to the Yellow River, Anguo, this agile steed, will let go of its four hooves again and gallop towards the Yangtze River. However, Anguo must also be vigilant and look around to see if there is another sister quietly stepping up its efforts and surpassing it at a rapid pace next year!

    安国和博野
    本报记者　金凤
    “本是姊妹县，相去何太悬？
    一将跨黄河，一尚滞途半！
    快马加鞭赶，前途差可及；
    蹉跎复蹉跎，又抵长江岸！”
    上面这首打油诗，是我最近去了一趟安国和博野，在归途的颠簸的公共汽车上，追思着两个县的见闻而诌的。读者欲知详情，且听下文分解。
    （一）将跨黄河——四百六十四斤，尚滞途半——二百四十斤
    安国和博野，都在河北省的中部。二县紧相邻接，安国在西，博野在东，地势都很平坦。孝义河横贯两县北部；沙河、滋河、小唐河、小清河流贯安国南境，汇集为潴龙河，流入博野南部。二县都属产棉区，各有三分之一土地植棉，多集中在北部的黄沙壤土。那里地势略高，易受春旱威胁。二县南部地势洼下，土质黑粘而肥沃，宜于种粮。但又易遭秋涝。每年平均降雨量都在六百公厘左右，大多集中在7、8月份，所以春旱秋涝的现象极易形成。粮食产量不高，历来都是缺粮县。五年计划的头一年——1952年是丰收年，安国粮食亩产三百三十点九斤，棉花（皮棉）亩产四十五点六斤；博野粮食亩产三百三十四点九斤，棉花亩产五十七点四斤；粮棉产量各属河北省的中、上等水平。1954年和1956年都闹水灾，两县都是重灾区，庄稼收成很少。1953和1955年年景也不强，收成也不多。这四年二县的粮棉产量都不及1952年，每年都需国家调拨进好几千万斤粮食。
    从以上简单的情况可以看出：安国和博野无论从自然条件——土壤、地质、气候、地形、河流、种植作物以至生产水平、历史沿革都相仿佛，它们是命运极其相似的一对姊妹县，除了安国面积略大，人口略多。安国有耕地面积五十六万七千亩，人口二十四万多。博野耕地面积三十七万五千多亩，人口十四万五千多人。在过去五年中，它们一起承受了“五年三灾”的沉重打击，共同走到五年计划的最后一年。
    1957年，情况起了绝大的变化！
    安国县今年粮食亩产四百六十四点九斤，比历史上最高产量的1952年提高了40.4％，提前十年达到全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）指标，改变了历史上的缺粮面貌。以前每年要国家供应两三千万斤粮食，今年卖给国家余粮二千六百万斤。棉花每亩产五十斤，比1952年提高9％左右。
    博野棉花生长得不错，每亩六十斤，也达到农业发展纲要修正草案的要求。而粮食每亩只产二百四十斤，比1952年低30％左右，今年仍需国家供应粮食二千万斤。
    两个紧邻的县份，生产条件大体相同，历史情况也差不多一样，为什么一个粮食亩产量将要跨过黄河达到亩产五百斤的指标，而另一个离五百斤还差一大半路程呢？
    （二）在逆流面前……
    事情还得从1956年说起。
    1956年春天，随着合作化高潮的到来，安国和博野和全国许多地方一样，掀起了以水利、积肥为中心的农业生产高潮。安国打机井一百八十七眼，打砖井四千五百多眼。博野也打了十眼机井，三千多眼砖井。二县积肥每亩都在万斤以上。
    不料1956年秋季一场洪水，把安国和博野新打的几千眼水井冲垮了，新买的几千架水车冲毁了，几十万亩庄稼被淹没，几万间房屋被冲倒。几万灾民无家可归，几十万灾民少吃无穿。
    合作化的头一年，碰上这样残酷的打击，农村中吹起一股小小的台风，一些动摇的富裕中农吵吵嚷嚷起来了：合作化没有优越性，1956年的领导冒进了，水利冒进了，积肥也搞糟了……地主富农乘机大肆活动，一起谩骂和攻击共产党的领导。他们把难以抗拒的天灾的责任也加到共产党的头上。那时候，一部分机会主义者也随声附和。群众思想混乱，干部消极、悲观，农业生产遭到严重的困难。
    在这样一股逆流面前，是奋勇前进，还是怯弱地退却呢？
    安国县的领导选择了第一条道路。他们用阶级分析的观点弄清了是非，澄清了混乱思想，统一了全党对1956年工作的认识：成绩是巨大的，主要的，缺点是次要的，是能够克服的（主要是有些农业技术改革措施没有因地制宜，工作中有些强迫命令，生产指标过高不切实际等）；并且使全体干部坚定地相信：在党的领导下，依靠群众的力量和智慧，合作社能够巩固，灾荒能够战胜，生产也一定能够跃进。他们一面集中了全党力量，组织群众，发动生产；一面在党内外广泛开展了深入的政治思想教育，向全党全民有力地提出了“不低头，不怕难，跌倒了爬起来，挺起腰板再干，去年干的欢，今年接着干”的政治动员口号。在政治动员中特别注意依靠骨干。中共安国县委发出了二千多封给经历过抗日战争和解放战争的老干部、老党员的信，启发他们回忆过去的斗争，对比今天的困难，要求他们站在群众前头，带领群众战胜困难。对广大群众则广泛进行了高级合作化优越性的教育，通过回忆对比，坚定大家战胜灾荒，争取丰收的信心。又通过总结工作，表扬了三千多名老党员、老干部和社会主义积极分子，对于消极工作的一百四十名干部和二百七十名有动摇情绪的富裕中农则进行了教育和批判。通过这一系列的工作，调动起各方面的积极力量，鼓起了广大干部和群众的干劲和勇气。南楼底村卢盘欣等老党员回忆了抗日战争的情景后，激愤地说：“那时脑袋掖在腰里，在敌人面前没有低过头，现在在水灾面前绝不能倒下去！”渔村乡郑老权、陈瑞年等一百七十多名老党员表示态度说：“还得像过去钻地洞时那样干！”安国县由于领导思想坚定明确，勇往直前，他们不仅领导全县胜利度过灾荒，而且在困难中争取到了1957年的空前丰收。
    可惜的是博野县的领导不是这样。他们挡不住逆流的冲击。当各地传来那股“冒进了”的谣风时，他们没有保持住清醒的头脑，错误地把只是一部分动摇的富裕中农的叫喊，当作群众的意见。他们被落后的思想拉住了。在制订今年的生产指标及各种生产措施的时候，只注意了灾区生产的困难方面，低估了群众的潜力。生产指标订得既低（粮食亩产只二百二十斤，安国今年的指标就是四百斤），增产措施也不具体。尤其在批判1956年生产高潮中产生的一些偏差时，挫伤了群众的积极性。在干部和群众中造成了这样一种错觉，就是“生产愈稳愈好”。这就使得生产陷于停滞不前的状态。有些合作社本来有水利条件，群众也要求增产，干部却放松领导而减了产。
    （三）两种不同的情况
    在两种不同的领导思想的指导下，安国和博野今年的生产就出现了两种不同的情况。
    首先是小麦的播种和管理方面。由于去年水灾严重，为了缩短灾期，争取丰收，省、地委都决定各县先抓一把，多种小麦。安国县提出了“克服一切困难，多、快、好地完成种麦任务”的号召，全县发动了十二万名劳力在二十五天内完成了二十六万亩麦田的突击播种。种麦紧张时期，在南部沿河地区，水还围着村子，牲口下不去地；为了争取时间，对地湿难耕的地区完全用人力耠地拉耧。到春节前后，又掀起了轧、耙小麦，盖粪、灌尿等加强麦田管理高潮。到了4月初，下了一场大雪，小麦普遍遭到冻害，给群众的生产热情泼了一盆凉水。群众说：“二月雪，麦子瘪，何况三月（按旧历）雪呢？”领导上一面访老农，找经验，肯定提出只要跟上水、肥，加强管理，麦子就能保住丰收；一面组织发动群众掀起了以追肥、浇水、深锄为中心的反灾保产高潮。不到半月，对十七万四千亩高旱麦地普遍突击浇了一水，对十万亩洼湿麦地普锄了一至二遍。为了全面增产，又大力发动了突击管理“次麦”（一部分种在洼碱地、生长不良的小麦）运动，六天中对全县八万亩次麦普遍追了肥，浇了水。在小麦孕穗时期，每亩又浇了二百斤人粪尿。结果历年只能收五、六十斤的小麦地今年获得平均亩产一百二十五斤的产量。全县二十六万多亩麦田，作到了追肥二次到三次，浇麦三水到五水，获得了平均亩产一百六十二斤的收成。
    博野县也种了十九万亩小麦。但是由于领导思想的右倾保守，只看到眼前的困难，忙着应付眼前的困难，虽然也想在种麦上抓一把，但思想上只是为了解决春天的口粮问题，因而只重视副业生产的领导，没有将注意力集中于农业生产。种麦的数量不少（几乎占全部粮食耕地的70％），质量却很差。许多地方没有翻地就硬插耧耩麦，造成小麦减产。七万多亩次麦，也没有加强管理，以致每亩只收三十斤到五十斤。4月下雪以后，麦苗受了严重打击，但是追肥、除虫、浇水的工作都没有赶上去。在安国和博野接界的许多地方，麦田挨着麦田，安国的小麦穗大粒肥，长得沉甸甸的。博野的小麦却长得稀稀松松。老百姓都说：“看人家安国的麦子，为啥咱们麦子长成那样？”到收割的时候，博野的麦收秩序又很不好，有些人连抢带偷，丢失在地上的很多。一个小学教员在假期就拾了六斗麦子。这样，博野今年种了十九万亩小麦，只收了十七万亩，每亩只收九十斤（1952年收一百四十多斤）。仅仅小麦这一项就比1952年减产一千多万斤。
    安国县的领导没有被“1956年工作冒进了”的谬论所吓倒，仍然坚持搞水利，搞积肥。今年春季，全县对所有的水井、水车普遍进行检查，共掏修机井二百八十七眼，修复砖井三千八百七十眼，锥井四百二十眼，修好水车四千七百三十架，安装抽水机二百零四台，购置新水车三百四十三辆。同时平整土地八万一千多亩，恢复和扩大浇地面积四十一万七千四百亩。这对今年的抗旱保产、保证丰收，起到了头等重要的作用。今年全年只零星降雨二百多公厘。为了确保秋收，安国县先后开展了“抗旱突击旬”、“艰苦奋斗四十天”和连续浇水近百天的突击运动，全凭人力和畜力浇熟了秋作物。在积肥方面，发动群众开展了经常性的积肥工作，并强调了质量，达到每亩施肥万斤。
    而博野县在今年春天检查了“冒进”，开展水利就不敢提了。1956年打的三千多眼井，多一半坏了，今年春天就没有抓紧修理。新井完全没打。水车砸毁了不少，也没及时修起，更没有买新的。大水冲过的土地，也没有平整。于是，在今年旱象发生以后，领导就完全陷于被动。要抗旱缺乏水井，缺乏水车。已长了庄稼的土地，不能平整，也不好浇水。于是大秋作物——玉米、高粱、夏薯、谷子都减了产。博野积肥也不多，每亩平均只有四千斤，比安国少一大半。
    另外，安国全县有70％的作物选用了优良品种，保证了增产。突出的如多穗高粱，平均增产107％。多种高产作物——甘薯，对增产也起了重要作用。全县种甘薯十二万三千多亩，占粮食作物面积的15.2％，而总产量竟达到七千九百九十多万斤（折粮食），占粮食总产量的49％。扩大复种面积的增产效果也很显著。今年安国复种指数达到142％。90％的麦田种了夏播作物，两茬比一茬平均增产60％。全县又消灭闲地一万四千亩，增加粮食四百多万斤。
    博野的小麦品种不齐，特别是高产作物种得太少，甘薯才种了三万亩，只有安国的四分之一。在棉花方面，博野抓得还是比较紧，因此出现了亩产六十斤的丰产纪录。
    （四）接受经验和教训，明年生产大跃进
    现在，安国在今年增产的基础上，要求明年粮食亩产五百五十斤，争取六百五十斤，棉花亩产达到八十斤。他们的口号是：“跨过黄河，奔向长江”。一个比1956年更深入的以水利、积肥、麦田管理为中心的生产高潮已经出现了。县委书记都下乡去了。夜晚田野里满地是灯。水车在转着，机井在打着，地里的土翻出一尺多深。每夜有六七万男女，在用大镐一镐镐地锄着他们幸福的明天。
    博野县也正在快马加鞭赶上去。他们明年的生产指标是：粮食亩产四百五十斤，棉花亩产七十斤。主要的措施是：改种高产作物和开展水利和积肥。改种高产作物的潜力很大，明年甘薯将由今年的三万亩增加到七万亩，谷子由二万亩增到四万亩，还要种多穗高粱二万一千亩。在水利方面，要打机井二百眼，砖井一千眼，改造七万亩洼地，疏浚孝义河，筑围田，打埝，挖排水沟和蓄水坑，在潴龙河建扬水站，争取全县明年实现水利化。积肥要达到二百六十万车，每亩平均七千斤。还要改良土壤，拉沙盖碱，大力推广优良品种，做好小麦管理和冬灌等。群众生产紧张得很，又是打井、修渠，又是拉粪、浇麦。领导上还以为抓得紧了，准备挨骂。可是群众这么忙，这么累，还很满意，说：“这才像个样子。今年春天劲头要这么足就对了！”还批评县委：“咱们春天那会要下狠劲，修修旧井，咱们粮食就不是二百四十斤，少说也得打三百斤！”
    从现在情况来看，安国的劲头比博野还是大一些。这从两县水利、积肥、浇麦、锄麦的进度，两县冬季生产出动的劳动力的比较上都可以看出来。安国现在每天出动劳力十一万五千多人，出勤率100％以上（全县劳力十万八千多人），而博野还只出动劳力77.6％。
    写到这里，读者对于开头那首打油诗的内容，当能完全了然。博野确实还须加一把劲，才能赶上安国。否则，当博野赶到黄河边时，安国这匹矫捷的骏马，又会放开四蹄，奔向长江去了。但是，安国也须警惕地四望，在它周围是不是又有另一个姊妹在悄悄地加劲，明年飞速地超越过它而前进啊！
