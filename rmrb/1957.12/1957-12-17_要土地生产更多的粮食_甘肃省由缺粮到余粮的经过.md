To Make the Land Produce More Grain
The Transformation of Gansu Province from Grain-Deficient to Grain-Surplus
Zhang Ming
Great Leap Forward

Gansu was originally a grain-deficient province, but now it has become a grain-surplus province.

This year, during the spring and autumn seasons, the Gansu region suffered a considerable degree of drought, but the farmers of Gansu, under the leadership of the Party and the government, still achieved a small bumper harvest. According to statistics, the total grain output of the province this year is 10.3 billion jin. Based on a rural and urban population of over 14 million, the average person can have 735 jin of grain; if 2 billion jin of seeds and feed are deducted, the average person still has 592 jin. This means that the grain harvested this year is enough for the people of the whole province to eat for one year and four months.

Compared with the impoverished lives of the people of Gansu before liberation, this is truly a Great Leap Forward. At that time, the province's population was not as large as it is now, but there were always more than a million disaster victims every year. 1949 was considered the biggest harvest year, but the total grain output was only more than 4.6 billion jin, averaging just over 416 jin per person. Even if all the seeds and feed were eaten, it still would not reach the current food ration standard, not to mention that most of the grain at that time was concentrated in the hands of landlords and rich peasants. If the harvest year was like this, the poverty and suffering brought to the peasants in the lean years was even more profound.

In the eight years after liberation, the annual grain output in the Gansu region has almost risen in a straight line. Taking the total output of 1950 as the base, the annual rate of increase during the economic recovery period averaged more than 12%. During the first Five-Year Plan, the annual growth rate averaged more than 23%.

During the first Five-Year Plan, Gansu Province produced a total of 43.1 billion jin of grain, exceeding the original plan by more than 14%. The yield per mu increased from 107 jin to 176 jin. The harvest situation in the five years was: one bumper year, three average years (or slightly better), and one lean year. But this kind of good and bad year is fundamentally different from the good and bad year before liberation. At that time, the grain output in a bumper year was not high, while a lean year meant hunger and death. The current bumper year is truly "grain overflowing the granaries," and a major disaster year can be turned into a minor disaster year, and a minor disaster year can become an average harvest year. In 1953, Gansu was a major disaster year, but it harvested more than 6 billion jin of grain, 1.4 billion jin more than the bumper harvest of 1949. The days of Gansu farmers eating "bran and vegetables for half a year" are long gone.

The Benefits of Cooperativization

Gansu was originally a poor province, and the peasants' family wealth was very meager. After the land reform, the peasants were allocated land, but the means of production were still very lacking. Gansu has a lot of land and few people, and there is a serious shortage of labor. Approximately, each laborer has to bear fourteen mu of arable land, so the farming is extensive, and the yield per unit area is very low. More than 70% of Gansu is mountainous, and it takes a lot of effort to carry out farmland capital construction. This is why the peasants who were liberated from feudal exploitation actively demanded to be organized.

In the first year after cooperativization, 1956, the people of Gansu won a bumper harvest. This year, a total of 10.9 billion jin of grain was produced, an increase of 31.8% over the previous year. More than 90% of the province's more than 19,000 agricultural cooperatives increased production, and more than 80% of the members increased their income.

Some people attempted to deny the superiority of cooperativization, saying that "the bumper harvest of 1956 was due to favorable weather conditions." Facts speak louder than words. 1949 was the year with the most favorable "weather," but that year was 6.3 billion jin less than this year. This year's "weather" was not favorable, but the grain output still reached 10.3 billion jin.

Vivid Leadership

After agricultural cooperativization, the people of Gansu, under the leadership of the Communist Party, systematically launched a struggle against nature. At the Gansu Provincial Party Congress held in the summer of 1955, the correct direction of the Gansu Party's leadership in agricultural production was affirmed. That is: grasp the characteristics and key factors for increasing production in various places, master the laws of various changes, make overall, local, and item-by-item plans, promptly and deeply check the implementation of the plans, overcome difficulties, and strive to overfulfill the task of increasing production. At that time, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China divided the province into eight types of areas: large-scale water conservancy areas, arid and rain-deficient areas, high-mountain rain-abundant areas, plateau hilly areas, ethnic minority mixed areas, pastoral areas, forestry areas, and urban suburban areas. Each type of area was required to master different key factors for increasing production according to local conditions.

The terrain within Gansu is complex, and the climate varies greatly from place to place. The annual rainfall in Minxian and other places reaches more than 600 millimeters, while Dunhuang and other places have only 45 millimeters. When the northern and western regions are still in the ice and snow, the southern regions are already warm and blooming. The complex natural conditions have both advantages and difficulties for agriculture. For example, the province has a wide variety of crops, with wheat, rice, millet, and potatoes, and can grow cotton and hemp, as well as raise silkworms, which is its advantage. However, Gansu has more natural disasters, including drought, hail, floods, insects, sandstorms, and frost, especially drought, which poses the greatest threat. In the Yellow River irrigation area in the north and the snow water irrigation area in the Hexi Corridor, they basically do not rely on rainfall. "No water, no agriculture" applies there. As for the twenty-seven counties and cities in the central region, they are famous arid mountainous areas, where the annual rainfall is only 70 to 300 millimeters, and most of it is concentrated in the autumn. Soil erosion is also very serious. According to historical records, from 1645 to 1906, a total of 114 droughts occurred in 261 years, an average of one every two years. The local saying is "nine droughts in ten years." This situation brings great difficulties to the reform of agricultural production in Gansu. However, when people understand the objective reality, grasp its characteristics, and take correct leadership methods and struggle measures, great potential can be tapped in agricultural production. It is based on this understanding that the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has adopted the method of zonal leadership, enabling all types of areas to increase production.

The central link in the reform of agricultural production in Gansu is the struggle against drought. In this regard, the people of Gansu have many excellent traditions. During the Qin and Han dynasties, many canals were built in Yinchuan and Hexi; terraced fields were built in the mountainous areas of Longdong and Longnan long ago; the wooden waterwheels several meters high rotating on the banks of the Yellow River were invented by people in the Ming Dynasty; and the sand-covered fields in the arid areas of central Gansu have a history of more than a hundred years. The people of Gansu have inherited these inherent good experiences for production. Their slogan is: Let the high mountains give way, let the river water go up the plateau, and use the water in the sky, on the ground, and underground to benefit the people!

The people of Gansu have shown great revolutionary spirit in fighting drought and building water conservancy projects. Thanks to the efforts of farmers and cadres throughout the province, nearly 9 million mu of irrigated land have been added after liberation. If each mu increases production by 150 jin of grain, a total of about 1.2 billion jin of grain can be increased. Plus, soil and water conservation alone can increase grain production by more than 2 billion jin. Take the Yangwayao Agricultural Cooperative in Gaolan County, which is arid, as an example. In four years, this agricultural cooperative, which has never had irrigated land, has developed to more than 1,100 mu of paddy fields, with an average of more than 1.2 mu of paddy fields per person. This year, this area encountered a small drought, and the cooperative still received more than 480,000 jin of grain, of which paddy fields accounted for one-sixth of the total cultivated area, but the harvest accounted for half. This year, the average person in the cooperative can have more than 560 jin of grain. If there were no more than 1,000 mu of paddy fields, the grain occupied per person could only reach 300 jin.

After liberation, Gansu also expanded the cultivated area by 8.68 million mu and carried out a series of reforms in agricultural production technology, which are also important reasons for becoming a grain-surplus province.

Struggle on the Ideological Front

Although there are many reasons for the achievements of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in the Gansu region, from the perspective of ideological guidance, it is mainly due to the continuous struggle against right-leaning conservative ideas inside and outside the Party.

In the autumn of 1955, Gansu Province universally studied Chairman Mao's report on agricultural cooperativization and criticized right-leaning conservative ideas. A situation of great change and Great Leap Forward appeared in the Gansu region, and agricultural cooperativization increased from 9.6% of peasant households joining the cooperative to more than 90%.

The main manifestation of the right-leaning conservative ideas in the Gansu region at that time was the "Gansu backwardness theory." People who held this view advocated that everything should be done "slowly," for fear of "rashly advancing" and causing trouble. There was a period when some cadres and masses in arid areas lacked confidence in changing the arid conditions, and in high-mountain and rain-abundant areas, pessimistic sentiments of "high mountains and deep gullies" were also expressed. But when these incorrect ideas were criticized, the enthusiasm for fighting against nature came.

In the central region, there were 550 arid townships, and in a few years, 150 of them changed their arid conditions. In the high-mountain and rain-abundant areas, the former saying was "harvest the mountains in drought, harvest the rivers in flood, and harvest the mid-mountain if it is neither drought nor flood," but now they have put forward the slogan "Strive to harvest the mountains and rivers together."

　　要土地生产更多的粮食
    甘肃省由缺粮到余粮的经过
　　张鸣
    大跃进
    甘肃原来是一个缺粮的省份，但现在已经变成了余粮省。
    今年春秋间，甘肃地区遭受了相当程度的旱灾，但甘肃的农民在党和政府的领导下，仍然取得了一个小丰年。据统计，今年全省粮食总产量是一百零三亿斤，按城乡人口一千四百多万计算平均每人可以有七百三十五斤粮食；如果扣除二十亿斤籽种和饲料，平均每人还有五百九十二斤。这就是说，今年收获的粮食足够全省人民吃一年零四个月的。
    对比解放前甘肃人民的贫困生活，这真是一个大跃进。那时全省人口没有现在多，但每年总有百多万灾民。1949年算得上最大的丰收，而粮食总产量只有四十六亿多斤，按人口平均每人不过四百一十六斤，即使把籽种和饲料都吃掉，仍然达不到现在的口粮标准，何况那时的粮食多半集中在地主富农手里。丰收年如此，歉收年给农民带来的贫困和痛苦，就更加深重了。
    解放后的八年间，甘肃地区粮食年产量几乎是直线上升的。以1950年的总产量为基数，在经济恢复时期，每年上升的速度平均是12％多。在第一个五年计划内，每年增长的速度平均达到23％以上。
    甘肃省在第一个五年计划内共生产粮食四百三十一亿斤，超过原计划的14％多，每亩产量由一百零七斤提高到一百七十六斤。五年中收成情况是：一丰、三平（或偏丰）、一歉。但这种丰歉年景和解放前的丰歉年景是根本不同的。那时丰收年粮食产量并不高，而歉收年却意味着饥饿和死亡。现在的丰收年才真正是“粮食满囤”，而大灾年可以化为小灾年，小灾年能够变成平收年。1953年甘肃是个大灾年，但却收获了六十亿斤以上的粮食，比大丰收的1949年还多收十四亿斤。甘肃农民们“糠菜半年粮”的日子早就一去不复返了。
    合作化带来的好处
    甘肃原来是个穷省，农民的家底非常薄。土地改革以后，农民分到了土地，但生产资料仍然很缺乏。甘肃地多人少，劳动力严重不足，大约每个劳动力要负担十四亩耕地，因此耕作粗放，单位面积产量很低。甘肃70％以上的地区是山区，要进行农田基本建设，必须花很大的力量。这就是从封建剥削下解放了的农民积极要求组织起来的原因。
    合作化后的第一年，1956年，甘肃人民就赢得了一个大丰收。这一年共生产粮食一百零九亿斤，比上年度增产31.8％。全省一万九千多个农业社，90％以上增产，80％以上的社员增加了收入。
    有些人企图否认合作化的优越性，说什么“1956年的大丰收是由于天时关系”。事实胜于雄辩。1949年是“天时”最利的一年，可是那一年比这一年却相差六十三亿斤粮食。今年的“天时”并不利，而粮食产量依然达到一百零三亿斤。
    生动的领导
    农业合作化以后，甘肃人民在共产党的领导下，有计划地向大自然展开了斗争。1955年夏天召开的甘肃省党代表会议上，曾经肯定了甘肃党领导农业生产的正确方向，这就是：抓住各地特点和主要增产关键，掌握各种变化规律，作出总体的、各地和各项的规划，及时深入地检查计划的执行，克服困难，努力争取超额完成增产任务。当时中共甘肃省委将全省分为大型水利区、干旱缺雨区、高山多雨区、高原丘陵区、民族杂居区、牧业区、林业区和城市郊区等八类地区，要求每类地区要因地制宜地掌握不同的增产关键。
    甘肃境内地形复杂，各地气候悬殊很大。岷县等地年雨量达六百多公厘，而敦煌等地却只有四十五公厘。当北部和西部地区还处在冰天雪地的时候，南部地区已经春暖花开了。自然情况复杂，对农业的影响既有好处，也有困难。比如全省农作物品种繁多，麦、稻、谷、薯样样俱全，能种棉麻，也能养蚕，这就是它的好处。但是，甘肃的自然灾害比较多，严重的有旱、雹、洪、虫、风沙、霜冻等天灾，尤其是旱灾威胁最大。在北部引黄灌溉区和河西走廊雪水灌溉区，基本上都不靠天雨，那里是“无水即无农业”；至于中部二十七个县、市范围内，则是有名的干旱山区，那里年雨量只有七十到三百公厘，而且大都是集中在秋季。水土流失现象也很严重。据历史上记载，自1645年到1906年的二百六十一年中，共发生旱灾一百一十四次，平均每二年有一次。而道地的说法却是“十年九旱”。这种情况给甘肃农业生产改革带来非常大的困难。不过当人们认识了客观实际，掌握了它的特点，并采取了正确的领导方法和斗争措施以后，农业生产上就会挖掘出巨大的潜力。中共甘肃省委正是基于这种认识而采取了分区领导的方法，使各类地区都能增产。
    甘肃农业生产改革上的中心环节是向干旱作斗争。在这方面甘肃人民有着许多优良的传统。秦汉时代，银川和河西地区就兴修了不少渠道；陇东陇南山区老早就有了梯田；黄河边上转动着的几丈高的木轮水车是明朝人发明的；中部干旱地区的铺砂田已经有百多年的历史。甘肃人民继承了这些固有的良好经验进行生产。他们的口号是：让高山让路，河水上塬，把天上、地面和地下的水都利用起来，为人民造福！
    甘肃人民在兴修水利与干旱作斗争方面，表现了极大的革命精神。由于全省农民和干部的努力，解放后全省共增加水地近九百万亩，如以每亩增产一百五十斤粮食计算，共可增产粮食约十二亿斤，再加上水土保持一项，就可增产粮食二十多亿斤。以干旱的皋兰县阳窊窑农业社为例，四年时间，这个一直没有水地的农业社发展到一千一百多亩水田，平均每人有水田一亩二分多。今年这一带遇到小旱灾，全社还收入了四十八万多斤粮食，其中水地占总耕地面积的六分之一，而收获却占一半。今年全社平均每人可有五百六十多斤粮食。假若没有这一千多亩水地，每人占有的粮食只能达到三百来斤。
  　解放后甘肃还扩大耕地面积八百六十八万亩，在农业生产技术上进行了一系列的改革，这也都是变成余粮省的重要原因。
    思想战线上的斗争
    甘肃地区社会主义革命和社会主义建设取得成就的原因虽然很多，但从思想指导上来说，主要是由于同党内外的右倾保守思想进行了不断的斗争。
    1955年秋天甘肃省普遍学习了毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告，批判了右倾保守思想，甘肃地区出现了大变革大跃进的局面，农业合作化由入社农户的9.6％达到90％以上。
    甘肃地区当时的右倾保守思想的主要表现是“甘肃落后论”，有这种观点的人，主张一切都要“慢慢来”，惟恐“冒进”出乱子。曾有一个时期，有些干旱地区的干部和群众对于改变干旱面貌缺乏信心，在高山多雨地区，也流露过“山大沟深”的悲观情绪。但当这种不正确的思想受到批判以后，和大自然作斗争的劲头就来了。
    在中部地区有五百五十个干旱乡，几年时间就有一百五十个改变了干旱面貌。在高山多雨地区，从前是“天旱收山，天涝收川，不旱不涝收半山”，但现在他们提出的口号却是“争取山川一齐收”。
