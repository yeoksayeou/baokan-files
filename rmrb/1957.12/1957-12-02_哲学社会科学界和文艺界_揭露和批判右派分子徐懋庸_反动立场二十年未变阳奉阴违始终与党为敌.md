Xinhua News Agency, December 1st: The Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Writers Association jointly convened a meeting from November 26th to 29th to expose and criticize the rightist Xu Maoyong within the Party. More than 300 people attended the meeting, including workers in philosophy and social sciences, literary and art workers, teachers from universities and colleges in the capital, and staff members from relevant newspaper and magazine editorial departments. Zhou Yang, Pan Zinian, Xia Yan, Liu Baiyu, Zheng Xin, Hou Wailu, Li Fanfu, Chen Xiaoyu, Ge Luo, Guan Feng, and more than 20 others spoke at the meeting. Prior to this, the Institute of Philosophy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences had held several meetings to expose and struggle against Xu Maoyong.

According to the revelations from previous meetings, from November of last year to August of this year, Xu Maoyong published nearly one hundred anti-Party and anti-socialist articles in newspapers and magazines in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places. In these articles, Xu Maoyong, under the guise of opposing sectarianism, bureaucratism, and dogmatism,肆无忌惮地attacked the leadership of the Communist Party and slandered Marxism-Leninism. He污蔑that the new society was undemocratic and called on people to rise up and fight for "democracy" with the spirit of "sacrificing oneself for righteousness"; he described the leading cadres of the Party as "ignorant and incompetent" and "bureaucrats" who relied solely on "status" to exercise leadership. He believed that there was almost no difference between the bourgeoisie and the working class in China at present, and advocated seeking common ground rather than differences between the two, believing that seeking differences was sectarianism. He said that there was a phenomenon of "a new dynasty brings its own courtiers" within the Communist Party, and that the Party's organizations at all levels had become large and small sectarian groups. He believed that anyone who insisted on a class standpoint and a class analysis method was a "dogmatist." He described all the socialist ideological education carried out by the Party among the people, especially the youth, as "dogmatism." He tried his best to create the impression that the people of China, especially intellectuals and young people, had not yet been liberated and were being persecuted by so-called "bureaucrats," "sectarians," and "dogmatists" everywhere, to the point where they were easily blamed. Almost all of his articles were filled with intense hostility towards the Party and the people, and he used every possible means of scolding, provoking, and slandering.

On the other hand, Xu Maoyong held a praising attitude towards the bourgeoisie. He tried his best to beautify the bourgeoisie, saying that the bourgeoisie supported socialism just like the proletariat; that bourgeois elements had already been proletarianized, and that the bourgeoisie could grasp the truth just like the proletariat.

Xu Maoyong opposed the Party's literary and artistic line and promoted the bourgeois literary and artistic line. He not only wrote a large number of anti-Party essays, but also created a set of "theories" in an attempt to turn essays with a glorious combat tradition into weapons against the Party and the people. He said that essays were unwilling to serve as "penicillin" only for small cadres, and advocated that the main target of essays should be leading cadres. He advocated using the methods of fighting against the enemy to fire at the Party and the people.

Xu Maoyong's anti-Party behavior has its historical roots. He himself admitted that his participation in revolutionary work was "opportunistic," and said that "what he has pursued in his life is personal fame, status, enjoyment, etc."

As early as 1936, he secretly wrote an extremely恶劣letter to Mr. Lu Xun behind the backs of the underground organizations of the Communist Party in Shanghai's cultural circles, causing losses to the cause of the Party and the people. In 1941, when he was working in the Taihang Mountain Anti-Japanese Base Area, he openly opposed the Party's leadership over literary and artistic work.

After liberation, during his tenure as Vice President of Wuhan University, he seriously undermined the Party's policy of winning over, uniting, and transforming intellectuals,排斥 and打击teachers he was dissatisfied with,鬧independent of the Party, and at the same time implemented personal leadership in his work, suppressed democracy, and disregarded organization. Because of the serious mistakes he had committed, the Party gave him a public warning, and he was administratively dismissed from his post. However, Xu Maoyong did not accept the Party's education, nor did he learn from his mistakes. After he left Wuhan University and was transferred to the Fifth Intermediate Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, he not only did not correct his mistakes, but continued to engage in non-organizational activities, opposed leadership, and shielded counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, in November 1955, he was again placed on probation within the Party for one year. At that time, although he admitted his mistakes, made a self-criticism, and expressed his willingness to "start anew," later facts showed that this was nothing but deception. At this time, he was transferred to work at the Institute of Philosophy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Not only did he not truly accept the work assigned to him by the Party, but he began to write his anti-Party essays, which were published under the pseudonyms "Huichun," "Fuxian," and "Tiqiu." By March and April of this year, when the bourgeois rightists' attacks became more and more rampant, he believed that the time was ripe, so he threw out his anti-Party essays in greater quantities, nakedly revealing his anti-Party face.

Xu Maoyong is a class异己element who混进 the Party. For nearly twenty years, the Party has continuously educated him, repeatedly pointed out his mistakes, and helped him to correct them, but he has always refused to abandon his bourgeois stand, was ostensibly compliant but opposed in his heart, and was hostile to the Party, so that at the juncture of the socialist revolution, he finally degenerated into a bourgeois rightist.

At the meeting on the 28th, the heads of the editorial departments of "People's Daily" (page 8), "People's Literature," "Literary Gazette," and "China Youth" and other newspapers and magazines, in their speeches, made self-criticisms for not promptly seeing the seriously anti-Party nature of Xu Maoyong's articles and publishing them, and criticized Xu Maoyong's articles published in these newspapers and magazines.

　　哲学社会科学界和文艺界
　　揭露和批判右派分子徐懋庸
　　反动立场二十年未变阳奉阴违始终与党为敌
    新华社1日讯　中国科学院哲学社会科学部和中国作家协会，在11月26日到29日联合召开了揭露和批判党内右派分子徐懋庸的会议，出席会议的有哲学社会科学工作者、文学艺术工作者、首都各高等学校的教师、各有关报刊编辑部的工作人员等三百余人。周扬、潘梓年、夏衍、刘白羽、郑昕、侯外庐、李凡夫、陈笑雨、葛洛、关锋等二十余人先后在会上作了发言。在这以前，中国科学院哲学研究所曾举行多次会议，对徐懋庸进行了揭发和斗争。
    根据历次会议的揭露，徐懋庸从去年11月到今年8月，在北京、天津、上海、武汉等地的报刊上发表了近一百篇反党、反社会主义的文章。在这些文章里，徐懋庸假借反对宗派主义、反对官僚主义和反对教条主义的名义，肆无忌惮地攻击共产党的领导，毁谤马克思列宁主义。他污蔑新社会不民主，号召人们以“杀身成仁”的精神起来争“民主”；他把党的领导干部描写成是一些“不学无术”、只靠“地位”来实行领导的“官僚主义者”。他认为当前我国资产阶级和工人阶级几乎已经没有区别，主张在两者之间求同而不应当求异，认为求异就是宗派主义。他说：在共产党内存在着“一朝天子一朝臣”的现象，在他笔下共产党的各级组织竟成了大大小小的宗派集团。他认为，凡是坚持阶级立场和阶级分析方法的就是“教条主义”。他把党在人民群众中，特别是青年中进行的社会主义思想教育一律说成是“教条主义”。他竭力企图造成这样一种印象：好像我国人民、特别是知识分子和青年，迄今尚未获得解放，他们到处受到所谓“官僚主义者”、“宗派主义者”和“教条主义者”的种种迫害，以至动辄得咎。几乎在他所有的文章里都充满了对党对人民的强烈的敌意，极尽谩骂挑拨诽谤之能事。
    另一方面，徐懋庸对资产阶级却抱着颂扬的态度，他竭力美化资产阶级，说资产阶级是和无产阶级一样的拥护社会主义；说资产阶级分子已经无产阶级化了，说资产阶级和无产阶级一样可以掌握真理。
    徐懋庸反对党的文艺路线，宣扬资产阶级的文艺路线，他不仅写了大量的反党杂文，而且制造出一套“理论”，企图把具有光荣战斗传统的杂文变成反党反人民的武器。他说小品文不愿意只给小干部充当“盘尼西林”，而主张小品文的锋芒主要应对准领导干部。主张用对敌斗争的办法，来向党和人民开火。
    徐懋庸的反党行为是有他的历史根源的。他自己承认，他的参加革命工作，是“投机取巧”，他说他“一生所追求的，是个人的名誉地位、享受等等。”
    早在1936年，他背着当时共产党在上海文化界的地下组织，擅自写了一封极为恶劣的信给鲁迅先生，给党和人民的事业，造成了损失。1941年，他在太行山抗日根据地工作，曾公开反对党对文艺工作的领导。
    解放后他在担任武汉大学副校长的时期，严重的破坏了党的争取、团结、改造知识分子的政策，排斥、打击他所不满的教师，对党闹独立性，同时在工作中实行个人领导，压制民主，目无组织。由于他所犯的错误严重，党曾给他以当众警告的处分，行政上则给以撤职的处分。但是，徐懋庸没有接受党对他的教育，没有从错误中吸取教训，当他离开武汉大学，调到中共中央第五中级党校工作以后，不但没有改正自己的错误，而且仍然进行非组织活动，反对领导，包庇反革命分子，所以在1955年11月又受到留党察看一年的处分。当时他虽然承认了错误，作了检讨，表示愿意“重新做人”，但是后来的事实表明这不过是一种欺骗，就在这个时候，他调到了中国科学院哲学研究所工作，他不仅没有真正接受党分配给他的工作任务，而且开始写他的反党杂文，用“回春”、“弗先”、“梯丘”等化名发表。到了今年3、4月间，资产阶级右派的进攻越来越猖狂的时候，他认为时机已到，就更大量地抛出了他的反党杂文，赤裸裸地显出了他的反党面目。
    徐懋庸是混进党内来的阶级异己分子。近二十年来，党不断的教育他，屡次的指出他的错误，帮助他改正，但是他始终不肯放弃他的资产阶级立场，阳奉阴违，与党为敌，以致在社会主义革命的关口终于堕落为资产阶级右派分子。
    在28日的会议上，“人民日报”第八版、“人民文学”、“文艺报”、“中国青年”等报刊编辑部的负责人，在他们的发言中，曾就自己没有及时看出徐懋庸的文章的严重反党性质而予以发表，作了自我批评，并对徐懋庸发表在这些报刊上的文章，进行了批判。
