　　Pingyang Huangyan contrast is sharp

　　One has poor natural conditions, but great enthusiasm and high grain yield

　　One has good natural conditions, but little enthusiasm and low grain yield

　　(Our newspaper dispatch) According to Zhejiang Daily news: Pingyang and Huangyan counties in the coastal plain area of Zhejiang have basically the same cultivated land area and the amount of land cultivated by each laborer. Pingyang also has 54 mm more annual rainfall than Huangyan, 15 more frost-free days, and Pingyang's average annual temperature is 1.1 degrees higher than Huangyan's. In other aspects such as drought resistance, Pingyang's conditions are also better than Huangyan's. However, the rate of grain yield increase in the two counties has varied greatly in recent years. In 1952, Huangyan's grain yield per mu was 489 jin, and Pingyang's was 540.1 jin, with Pingyang being higher than Huangyan. Last year, Huangyan was 734.5 jin, and Pingyang was 576.4 jin, with Huangyan exceeding Pingyang. This year, Huangyan continues to maintain its leading position, with Pingyang's average yield per mu expected to be 599 jin and Huangyan's yield per mu expected to be 809 jin.

　　What exactly is hindering the increase in grain production in Pingyang?

　　The main reason is that Pingyang County did not grasp the main keys to increasing production, such as fertilizer, water conservancy, and changing the cropping system, in leading production. Although they were generally working on these, they were not as good as Huangyan.

　　The low level of fertilization in Pingyang is the most important reason for the low yield. In Pingyang County, early and late rice are generally only fertilized four to five times, and the amount of fertilizer applied each time is not large. 40% of the county's 300,000 mu of sweet potatoes are not fertilized. The reason for the low fertilization level is the backward winter production and the neglect of raising pigs for manure accumulation. About 40% of the winter fallow land in Pingyang County is left idle, with some districts having as much as 70%. Of the county's more than 700,000 mu of paddy fields, only more than 70,000 mu were planted with green manure last year, with an average of only one mu of green manure per ten mu of land. The county only raised 90,000 pigs last year, 5,000 fewer than in 1952, with an average of only one pig per eleven mu of land. Moreover, the habit of not keeping pigs in pens in some places has not been changed. Therefore, the shortage of fertilizer is becoming increasingly serious. The reason for this phenomenon is that the county party committee did not grasp it firmly enough and lacked enthusiasm. For example, last year it was proposed to expand the planting of green manure to 140,000 mu, but due to the conservative thinking of the county party committee and its lack of determination, only more than 70,000 mu were planted.

　　Huangyan's approach to accumulating fertilizer is very different from Pingyang's. Huangyan has maintained the area planted with green manure at around 400,000 mu in recent years, and this year it planted 420,000 mu, accounting for about 80% of the paddy field area. The number of pigs raised also greatly exceeds that of Pingyang, with an average of one pig raised per four and a half mu of land. With more green manure and more pig manure, the grain yield is naturally higher.

　　In terms of water conservancy, Pingyang has good water conservancy conditions, but its enthusiasm for building water conservancy is far less than that of Huangyan. Huangyan has built nearly 10,000 agricultural water conservancy projects in the past five years, including 1,345 this year alone, greatly improving irrigation conditions. Pingyang's leading cadres, however, believe that there is no good water conservancy to build; cadres in mountainous areas want to build large-scale water conservancy, believing that small-scale water conservancy cannot solve the problem. "Large ones cannot be built, and small ones are unwilling to build." This has once again relaxed water conservancy work.

　　Changing the cropping system requires conditions, such as a relatively sufficient source of water, fertilizer, etc. But it must also have enthusiasm and overcome conservative thinking. Huangyan's high grain yield is also the result of their resolute overcoming of conservative thinking and vigorously changing the cropping system. From 1953 to this year, intercropping rice converted to continuous cropping rice accounted for 38.7% of the paddy field area in Huangyan County, single-season rice converted to double-season rice accounted for 11.65%, two crops converted to three crops accounted for 32.02%, and green manure intercropped with barley accounted for 13.4%. The annual land utilization rate reached 226.85%. Although Pingyang has great potential for changing the cropping system, the leadership has not considered it from the perspective of achieving the "800 jin" target. Based on the existing conditions, it is certain that the county can plant 350,000 to 400,000 mu of continuous cropping rice, and most of the 200,000 mu of single-season rice in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas can also grow a second crop of autumn sweet potatoes, which can increase grain production by 400 to 500 jin per mu. However, the county planted 350,000 mu of continuous cropping rice last year, and this year it originally planned to maintain the original area, but the result of implementation was reduced to more than 250,000 mu, accounting for only about 30% of the total paddy field area.

　　Pingyang's climate conditions are good, and the production season should be the earliest, but this is not the case in reality. Huangyan, which has a later season, dares to loudly propose and achieve no more than five "gates" (preparatory tillage does not pass the vernal equinox gate, early rice transplanting does not pass the beginning of summer gate, late rice transplanting does not pass the major heat gate, green manure sowing does not pass the frost's descent gate, and winter planting does not pass the beginning of winter gate). Pingyang lacks such enthusiasm. Early rice starts transplanting early, but transplants slowly, and less than half is transplanted by the beginning of summer; late rice transplanting is delayed until seven to ten days after the major heat; red clover sowing is delayed by six or seven days after the frost's descent; and the sowing of wheat and barley cannot be completed until ten days after the minor snow. Dragging on like this season after season makes it impossible to make full use of favorable natural conditions. Although the Pingyang County Party Committee has also called on cadres to seize the season, it only requires seizing the production season of the masses' old habits, such as "wheat is planted near the end of the year, and rape is planted for two years (planted inside and outside the year)," which cannot be said to be promoting advanced methods but only accommodating backward ones.

　　Due to the Pingyang County Party Committee's lack of enthusiasm, lack of determination, and satisfaction with general production leadership in striving to achieve the "800 jin" target ahead of schedule, it has also affected the enthusiasm and creativity of district and township cadres in leading production.

　　At the same time, the county party committee has not done a good job in timely summarizing and promoting advanced experience. In various production measures, the county lacks clear banners and cannot come up with convincing examples to educate cadres, so as to overcome the conservative thinking of cadres and boost their enthusiasm. On the contrary, the county party committee still has a certain degree of conservative thinking. For example, in expanding the planting of green manure last year, the county party committee believed that farmers lacked the habit and did not dare to promote it boldly.

　　In order to catch up with Huangyan, Pingyang has now preliminarily formulated the county's future production plan and put forward corresponding measures for production this winter and next spring. For example, the original plan was to expand the planting of green manure to 210,000 mu, but it can now be completed to 270,000 mu; the number of pigs raised has also developed to 160,000, and will be increased to 300,000 next year; this winter and next spring, a "hundred reservoirs and thousand ponds" water conservancy construction campaign will also be launched to build more than 100 reservoirs. The county party committee has also decided to comprehensively summarize and promote advanced experience, grasp the advanced, set up banners, and mobilize all cadres to carry out a major debate to clarify the reasons for the low yield, find the key to increasing production, break the conservative thinking of district and township cadres, boost their enthusiasm, and then fully mobilize and rely on the masses to launch a new production upsurge.

　　平阳黄岩对比鲜明
    一个自然条件差，但干劲大，粮食产量高
    一个自然条件好，但干劲小，粮食产量低
    本报讯　据浙江日报消息：浙江沿海平原地区的平阳和黄岩两县，耕地面积和每个劳动力负担耕作的田亩基本上相同，年雨量平阳还比黄岩多五十四公厘，无霜期也比黄岩多十五天，年平均温度平阳也比黄岩高一度一，其它在抗旱力等方面，平阳的条件也比黄岩好。但是，两个县几年来粮食产量增长幅度却相差悬殊。1952年，黄岩粮食亩产量是四百八十九斤，平阳是五百四十点一斤，平阳比黄岩高。去年，黄岩是七百三十四点五斤，平阳是五百七十六点四斤，黄岩超过了平阳。今年，黄岩继续保持领先的地位，预计平阳平均亩产五百九十九斤，黄岩亩产八百零九斤。
    究竟是什么原因阻碍着平阳的粮食增产速度呢？
    主要原因是平阳县在领导生产中没有抓住肥料、水利和改变耕作制度等主要的增产关键。他们虽然一般地也在抓，但比起黄岩来，就显得差劲。
    平阳施肥水平低是产量不高的最主要原因。平阳县早、晚水稻一般只施肥四至五次，每次施肥的数量也不多。全县三十万亩番薯有40％不施肥。施肥水平低的原因是冬季生产落后和忽视了养猪积肥。平阳全县冬闲田约有40％，有的区多到70％。全县七十多万亩水田，去年只种草子七万多亩，平均十亩田只有一亩草子。全县去年只养猪九万头，比1952年还少养五千头，平均十一亩田地才有一头猪。而且有些地方养猪不关栏的习惯仍旧未改。因此，缺肥现象日益严重。形成这种现象的原因，是由于县委抓的不牢，劲头不足。如去年提出扩种绿肥十四万亩，由于县委存在保守思想，态度不坚决，结果只种下七万多亩。
    黄岩对积肥的做法就和平阳大不相同。黄岩这几年种草子的面积一直保持在四十万亩左右，今年种了四十二万亩，占水田面积的80％左右。养猪数量也大大超过平阳，平均四亩半田养一头猪。绿肥多、猪肥多，粮食产量当然高。
    在水利方面，平阳的水利条件好，但修水利的劲头却远不如黄岩。黄岩五年来修了近一万处农田水利工程，光今年就修了一千三百四十五处，大大改善了灌溉条件。平阳领导干部却认为没有什么水利好修；山区的干部要修大型水利，认为小型水利不能解决问题。“大的办不了，小的不愿办。”这样就又把水利工作放松了。
    改变耕作制度要有条件，如比较充足的水源、肥料等等。但也必须要有劲头，要克服保守思想。黄岩粮食产量高，也是他们坚决克服了保守思想，大力改变耕作制度的结果。从1953年到今年，黄岩全县间作稻改连作稻占水田面积38.7％，单季稻改双季稻占11.65％，二熟改三熟占32.02％，草子间作大麦占13.4％。全年土地利用率达到226.85％。平阳改变耕作制度的潜力虽然很大，但领导上却没有从实现“八百斤”的要求来考虑。根据现有条件，全县种三十五万到四十万亩连作稻是有把握的，山区和半山区的二十多万亩单季稻，大部分还可多种一熟秋番薯，每亩可增产四、五百斤粮食。但是，全县去年种连作稻三十五万亩，今年原计划维持原来面积，执行结果却缩小到二十五万多亩，只占水田总面积30％左右。
    平阳气候条件好，生产季节应该是最早的，但实际并不如此。季节较迟的黄岩，他们敢于响亮地提出和做到不过五个“关”（备耕不过春分关，早稻插秧不过立夏关，晚稻插秧不过大暑关，绿肥播种不过霜降关，冬种不过立冬关）。平阳就缺乏这样的劲头。早稻开始插秧早，但插得慢，到立夏还插不到一半；晚稻插秧要到大暑后七至十天；红花草子播种要过霜降六、七天；大小麦播种要到小雪后十天才能结束。这样一季拖、季季拖，就不能充分利用有利的自然条件。平阳县委虽然也号召干部要抓季节，但只要求抓群众旧习惯的生产季节，比如“小麦种年边，油菜种两年（年里种到年外）”，这不能说是推广先进而只能说是迁就落后。
    由于平阳县委领导上对争取提早实现“八百斤”劲头不足、决心不大、满足于一般化的生产领导。也就影响了区、乡干部领导生产的积极性和创造性。
    同时县委对及时总结和推广先进经验也做得较差，在各项生产措施中，全县没有鲜明的旗帜，拿不出有说服力的典型来教育干部，以克服干部的保守思想，鼓起劲头。相反，县委尚存在一定程度的保守思想，如去年扩种绿肥，县委就认为农民缺少习惯，不敢大胆推广。
    为了赶上黄岩，现在平阳已初步订出全县今后生产规划，并提出今冬明春生产上的相应措施。如原计划扩种绿肥二十一万亩，现可完成二十七万亩；养猪也发展到十六万头，明年要增加到三十万头；今冬明春还要开展一个“百库千塘”的兴修水利运动，要造一百多个水库。县委也决定全面总结推广先进经验，抓先进，树立旗帜，发动全体干部开展大辩论，辩明产量不高的原因，找出增产关键，打破区、乡干部的保守思想，鼓起劲头，然后充分发动和依靠群众，掀起新的生产高潮。（附图片）
