　　The U.S. Boosts the Chiang Gang
　  Is Transferring Tactical Missile Air Force Squadrons to Taiwan
    Xinhua News Agency, December 4th: Singapore dispatch: U.S. Pacific Air Forces Commander Carter told reporters in Singapore on the 3rd that the U.S. is transferring tactical missile air force squadrons to Taiwan.
    Carter said that this action by the U.S. is to increase the fighting power and "internal strength" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique.
    It has been previously reported that the U.S. had announced that it would transfer an air force unit equipped with "Matador" tactical missiles to Taiwan. The advance team of this unit arrived in Taiwan in May of this year.
    Carter, who is about to travel to Malaya, Australia, New Zealand, and other places, said that the U.S. Air Force has "always been very interested" in bases in Southeast Asia. He also said that it is "not impossible" for the U.S. Air Force to obtain bases in Malaya.
