    This stadium is located in Tiexi District, Shenyang. Tiexi District is a densely populated area for workers in Shenyang, and the construction of the stadium here provides convenient activities for the workers.

    The stadium has a total area of 40,000 square meters, with relatively complete field equipment and various sports equipment. The field has a 400-meter running track, as well as basketball, volleyball, and tennis courts, a standard soccer field, and complete gymnastic equipment.

    这个体育场在沈阳铁西区。铁西区是沈阳市工人们聚居的地区，体育场修建在这里，工人们活动很方便。
    这座体育场总面积为四万平方公尺，场地设备和各种体育运动器材，都比较完整。场内有四百公尺跑道，还有篮、排、网球场地和一个正规的足球场地，还有完整的各种体操设备。此外，还专设有两座灯光球场，到夜晚还可以进行篮、排球比赛。
    沈阳市工会联合会为了广泛开展全市职工冬季体育活动，今冬将把这个体育场全部浇成冰场，并准备了六百多双冰鞋，以便租借给职工同志们使用。
