Why aren't freshly dug sweet potatoes sweet?
    New sweet potatoes that come on the market in the autumn are never as sweet and palatable as those that have been stored in a cellar. What is the reason for this? After sweet potatoes have been placed in a cellar for a period of time, the starch within them undergoes hydrolysis due to the suitable temperature and humidity of the cellar. The starch then turns into glucose, which is sweet, so cellar-stored sweet potatoes are particularly sweet.

　  为什么新刨出的白薯不甜？
    秋天新上市的白薯，总不如入过窖的白薯甜美适口。这是什么原因呢？白薯在地窖内放置一段时间，其中的淀粉由于地窖的温度和湿度合适而产生了水解作用，淀粉就变成有甜味的葡萄糖，所以入过窖的白薯分外的甜。
