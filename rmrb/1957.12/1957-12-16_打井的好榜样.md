    Good Example of Well-Drilling
    Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, conducted an inspection of the 3,834 brick wells that were completed this year. The results of the inspection were: 72% had a water depth of 10 to 15 feet, a little over 26% had a water depth of 7 to 10 feet, and the remaining had a water depth of about 5 feet. What do these results indicate? They indicate that none of the 3,800-plus wells are useless.
    In the high tide of water conservancy construction, people often pursue the quantity of projects and neglect the quality of the projects. In the production upsurges of the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956, there were such lessons. Some areas drilled wells that were only for show.
    In order to eliminate the threat of drought to agricultural production, more wells should be drilled. However, while completing a large quantity, the quality must also be ensured. Pingyuan County has set a good example for everyone in this regard this year, with both quantity and quality guaranteed.

    打井的好榜样
    山东平原县对今年已打成的三千八百三十四眼砖井进行了检查，检查的结果是：水深十尺到十五尺的占72％强，水深七尺到十尺的占26％多，其余的水深五尺左右。这个结果说明什么呢？说明三千八百多眼井，没有一个废品。
    在兴修水利的高潮当中，人们往往由于追求工程数量而忽视了工程质量。1955年冬季和1956年春季生产高潮里，就有过这样的教训，有些地区打的井是“看井”。
    为了消灭农业生产上的干旱威胁，应当多打井，但是在完成数量多的同时还要保证质量好。平原县今年在这方面给大家树立了好的榜样，既有数量，也保证了质量。
