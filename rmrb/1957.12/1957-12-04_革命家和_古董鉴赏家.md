　　Revolutionaries and "Antique Appraisers"
　　Huang Yu
    When being sent to lower levels for labor, some people said: "Strengthening the study of political theory can also lead to progress, it is not necessary to go to the countryside and mountains." Those who said this were merely using the excuse that studying theory can also lead to progress to evade going to the countryside and mountains and reject ideological remolding.
    Our Party attaches great importance to the study of political theory. Many cadres of worker and peasant origin, after studying Marxism, progressed from the ideas of trade unionism and economism to communist ideas. For many intellectuals, their progress often begins with exposure to Marxist works. The class struggle of the proletariat only has its true life after the advent of Marxism. "Once theory grips the masses, it becomes a material force." (Marx) However, studying political theory is not the only medicine for bourgeois intellectuals to remold their thinking, let alone a panacea. If it were a panacea, why were some intellectuals who had specialized in the study of political theory for several years still bourgeois rightists during the initial period of the rectification campaign's "Great Blooming and Contending"? Some, though not rightists, still wavered left and right and were unclear about right and wrong on key issues. When Ge Peiqi issued counter-revolutionary remarks, workers with little literacy immediately smelled its thoroughgoing reactionary nature; while some intellectuals only felt that he was "a little off" on individual issues. This is the issue of different class standpoints and class feelings: those workers have clear-cut love and hate, and although they do not have a high level of theoretical sophistication, they can see at a glance who is the enemy, who is a friend, and who is a comrade. Lu Xun said: "Although the common people do not read poetry and books, do not understand historical methods, and do not understand seeking flaws in jade or finding the Dao in dung, they can see from the general situation, distinguish between black and white, and distinguish between right and wrong, which is often something that clear-headed and enlightened scholar-officials cannot achieve." ("Title Undecided" Draft Nine)
    For intellectuals from exploiting classes, the proletarian standpoint and class feelings cannot be obtained overnight; acquiring it is a long process. The great revolutionary writer Lu Xun was previously only an evolutionist, a revolutionary democrat, and a rebellious son and renegade official of the gentry class. He eventually became a staunch fighter of the proletariat. In addition to his long-term and serious study of scientific literary theory and Marxism, he also actively approached the leadership of the Party and participated in and led the struggle on the cultural front. Lu Xun experienced countless great life waves and had extremely rich life experiences.
    Many of our intellectuals, especially young intellectuals, have neither experienced life waves like Lu Xun nor have Lu Xun's life experience, and are unwilling to go deep among the workers and peasants and into practical struggles like revolutionaries. Can they become revolutionaries simply by reciting some Marxist theory?
    "When intellectuals have not integrated with the revolutionary struggle of the masses, and when they have not resolved to serve the interests of the masses and combine with the masses, they often have tendencies towards subjectivism and individualism, their thoughts are often empty, and their actions are often wavering." (Mao Zedong: "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party") Because the labor mode of intellectuals is individual, they always exhibit arrogance and despise the masses to varying degrees before they thoroughly establish a communist worldview; they often demand egalitarianism from above, while exhibiting special treatment from below; they often want only democracy and not centralism, want only freedom and not discipline; they are either boastful, or frivolous, or fanatical, or extreme, or sentimental, or listless, or depressed, or pessimistic. This series of problems cannot be solved simply by reading a few Marxist works.
    Marxism comes from class struggle and the struggle for production, and it itself requires returning to the masses. Those who say "studying political theory can also lead to progress, and there is no need to go to the countryside and mountains," even if they have read a lot of Marxist works and their work performance is good, it is only because there is no conflict with their personal interests. When they are asked to go to the countryside and mountains, the individualism in the depths of their souls is exposed. Chairman Mao called those who treat Marxism only as an antique for personal enjoyment "antique appraisers." This kind of person has nothing in common with a revolutionary, cannot withstand the revolutionary storm, and often goes against the revolution. This is worth deep vigilance.

　　革命家和“古董鉴赏家”
　　黄郁
    在下放干部的时候，有人说：“加强政治理论学习，同样可以进步，不一定非下乡上山不可的。”说这话的，不过以学习理论也可以进步为幌子，逃避下乡上山、拒绝思想改造而已。
    我们党是极其重视政治理论学习的。很多工农出身的干部，在学习马克思主义后，便由工联主义、经济主义的思想进到共产主义思想。很多知识分子，他们的进步往往是由接触马克思主义著作开始的。无产阶级的阶级斗争也只在有马克思主义后才有它的真正的生命。“理论一旦把握着大众，就要变成物质的力量。”（马克思）但学习政治理论，却不是资产阶级知识分子进行思想改造的唯一的药，更非万应灵药。如果它是万应灵药，为什么在整风初期的大鸣大放中，一些专门研究政治理论已经好几年的知识分子，却仍然是资产阶级右派？有的虽非右派，但在节骨眼的问题上，左右摇摆，是非不清。葛佩琦发出反革命言论时，识字不多的工人立刻嗅出了它的彻头彻尾的反动性；而有些知识分子只感到他在个别问题上“有点不对头”而已。这就是阶级立场阶级感情不同的问题：那些工人爱憎分明，虽未有高深的理论水平，却能一眼看出谁是敌人、谁是朋友、谁是同志。鲁迅说过：“老百姓虽然不读诗书，不明史法，不解在瑜中求瑕，屎里觅道。但能从大概上看，明黑白，辨是非，往往有决非清高通达的士大夫所可几及之处的。”（“题未定”草九）
    无产阶级的立场和阶级感情，对于出身于剥削阶级的知识分子来说，决非一朝一夕所能获得的，获得它是一个长期的过程。伟大的革命作家鲁迅，先前也只是进化论者、革命民主主义者、绅士阶级的逆子贰臣，他最后成为无产阶级的坚强斗士，除了他长期认真研究科学的文艺理论、学习马克思主义外，还积极地靠拢党的领导，参加并且领导了文化战线上的斗争。鲁迅是经历了无数次巨大的生活波涛，有着极其丰富的生活经验的。
    我们很多知识分子，特别是知识青年，既未经历过鲁迅那样的生活波涛，也无鲁迅那样的生活经验，又不愿像革命者那样深入工农群众、深入实际斗争，难道只背诵一些马克思主义理论，便能成为革命者？
    知识分子“在其未和群众的革命斗争打成一片，在其未下决心为群众利益服务并与群众相结合的时候，往往带有主观主义和个人主义的倾向，他们的思想往往是空虚的，他们的行动往往是动摇的。”（毛泽东：“中国革命和中国共产党”）由于知识分子的劳动方式是个人的，因此在他们彻底建立共产主义世界观之前，总在不同程度上表现出自高自大，轻视群众；他们往往对上要求平均主义，对下则表现特殊；他们往往只要民主、不要集中，只要自由、不要纪律；他们或虚夸、或浮骄、或狂热、或偏激、或温情、或萎靡、或消沉、或悲观。这一系列，仅靠看几本马克思主义著作是不能解决问题的。
    马克思主义从阶级斗争、生产斗争中来，它本身就要求回到群众中去。那些说“学习政治理论也可以进步，不必下乡上山”的人，即便马克思主义著作看的不少，工作表现不错，那也只因为和他们个人利益没有发生矛盾。要他们下乡上山，他们灵魂深处的个人主义便暴露出来了。这种把马克思主义只当作徒供玩好的古董的人，毛主席称他为“古董鉴赏家”。这种人和革命家毫无相同之点，经不起革命的风浪，往往同革命背道而驰。这是值得深深警惕的。
