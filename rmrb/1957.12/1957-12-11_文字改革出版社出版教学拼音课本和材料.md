    The Chinese Character Reform Publishing House
    Publishes Teaching Pinyin Textbooks and Materials
    (Our Newspaper) In order to meet the needs of the broad masses of people in learning the "Draft Plan for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet," the Chinese Character Reform Publishing House has recently published the following seven kinds of teaching Pinyin textbooks and materials.
    "Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Textbook." From the textbook, readers can learn the initials, finals, and Mandarin Chinese syllables of the "Draft Plan for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet," as well as the more commonly used Chinese characters to which each syllable belongs. In the "Analogy" section of Chinese characters in each lesson, a considerable number of compound words are listed in the order of level tone, rising tone, falling-rising tone, and falling tone.
    "Table of Common Chinese Characters with Pinyin (First Draft)." This table collects three thousand nine hundred and eighty-six relatively common Chinese characters. Arranged by syllable and four tones, it contains the standard pronunciation and spelling of nearly four thousand Chinese characters, making it very convenient to check.
    "Chinese Syllable Table." This table has four parts: an alphabet table; a syllable table; an initial and final table; and a comparison table of the initials and finals of the "Draft Plan for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet" with the Zhuyin symbols, Gwoyeu Romatzyh, and Latinxua Sin Wenz.
    "Draft Plan for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet - Alphabet Table" and "Draft Plan for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet - Initials and Finals Table" are both wall charts.
    "Cut-out Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Draft Plan Letter Cards" are printed with lowercase regular script phonetic letters. These cards can be used as a teaching aid for beginners to practice recognizing letters and Pinyin.
    "Wall Chart of Common Character Pinyin Table." In the table, the vertical rows are initials, and the horizontal rows are finals. The intersection of the vertical and horizontal rows forms individual squares. Chinese characters with the same pronunciation are printed as a group in the corresponding squares. The homophones in each square are further divided into five positions according to the five tones of level tone, rising tone, falling-rising tone, falling tone, and neutral tone.
