　　More Long-Term Planning, Expand Public Accumulation
　　Red Sun Cooperative Passes Autumn Harvest Distribution Great Debate
　　Sell More Surplus Grain, Keep More Public Accumulation
　　(Our Newspaper News) The Red Sun Agricultural Cooperative in Guangning County, Guangdong Province, organized a great debate on the issue of autumn harvest distribution during the harvesting of late-season rice. As a result of the debate, the entire cooperative unanimously agreed that, in addition to ensuring the completion of the task of paying public grain and selling surplus grain, they would sell an additional 15,000 jin of surplus grain, deduct 7% for public accumulation, and have an average household income of 203 yuan, an increase of 10% compared to last year.
　　Red Sun Cooperative is a production-increasing cooperative. The cooperative members first started a debate on how to handle the surplus grain after fulfilling the state's tasks. Upper-middle peasant Feng Zhaorong believed that with increased production, they should eat more, and the surplus grain should be distributed according to work points. However, poor peasant Chen Jiajin immediately objected. He said, "Our cooperative's grain ration has increased every year, and last year's standard of 500 jin of retained grain per person was already very good. The surplus grain should be sold to the state." Poor peasant Chen Zhilin also agreed, saying, "We wouldn't have been able to increase production without the state's support." He listed the fact that the state had given the cooperative loans of 6,000 yuan this year alone, supplied 10,000 jin of commercial fertilizer, and more than 200 jin of insecticide powder, proving that they should sell more grain to the state. However, some people suggested: We just need to ensure the completion of the task, and the rest is the government's business; the government will have its own way to solve it. Before the words were finished, they were immediately opposed by the majority of people. Poor peasant Chen Qun said, "The government is ours, and we must also rely on ourselves for solutions. When our cooperative suffered from a flood and reduced production in 1954, the government supported us with more than 20,000 jin of rice and a loan. Wasn't this transferred from production-increasing areas? Now that our production has increased, we should sell more surplus grain to support disaster areas." Thus, it was unanimously agreed to sell an additional 15,000 jin of surplus grain this year.
　　Then, the topic turned to public accumulation. Upper-middle peasant Chen Xingjin believed that public accumulation should be kept at most 1%. Poor peasant Chao Ying objected, believing that public accumulation could expand production and truly improve the lives of cooperative members. He said: Weren't the more than ten mu of fields in Dakengzhou able to increase the yield from 400 jin per mu to more than 800 jin per mu because a canal was built with the cooperative's public accumulation! Finally, it was unanimously agreed that, based on production needs and possibilities, 5% of the net income would be deducted for public accumulation and 2% for public welfare funds, for a total of more than 3,900 yuan for next year's expanded production expenses.

### 红太阳社通过秋收分配大辩论　多卖余粮多留公积金

    多从长远打算　扩大公共积累
　　红太阳社通过秋收分配大辩论
　　多卖余粮多留公积金
    本报讯　广东省广宁县红太阳农业社在收割晚造水稻的时候，组织了一次关于秋收分配问题的大辩论。辩论结果，全社一致通过除了保证完成缴公粮、卖余粮的任务外，又多卖余粮一万五千斤，扣除公共积累7％，平均每户收入二百零三元，比去年增加了10％。
    红太阳社是一个增产社。社员们首先对完成国家任务后的余粮怎么处理的问题展开了争论。上中农冯召荣认为增产了就应该多吃一点，余粮应按工分分配。可是贫农陈家金马上提出反对。他说：“我们社年年口粮都有增加，去年每人五百斤的留粮标准已经很不错了。多余的粮食应该卖给国家。”贫农陈芝林也同意这样做，他说：“我们如果没有国家的支援就增不了产。”他列举出今年国家单给该社的贷款就有六千元，供应商品肥一万斤，杀虫粉二百多斤的事实，证明应当多卖点粮食给国家。可是有些人又提出：我们保证完成任务就行了，其他是政府的事，政府自有办法解决。话还没有说完，就马上遭到多数人反对，贫农陈群说：“政府是我们的，办法也要靠我们。1954年我们社受水灾减产的时候，政府就支援了二万多斤大米和一笔贷款，这不是增产地区调来的吗？现在我们增了产就应该多卖余粮，支援灾区。”于是一致通过今年晚造多卖余粮一万五千斤。
    接着，话题就转到了公共积累上面来。上中农陈行金认为公共积累最多留1％就够了。贫农超英提出反对，认为公共积累可以扩大生产，真正的改善社员生活。他说：大坑洲十多亩田不就是因为用社的公积金修建了一条水渠，每亩产量才由四百斤提高到八百多斤吗！最后一致通过根据生产需要和可能，在纯收入中扣除公积金5％，公益金2％，共提出了三千九百多元作明年扩大生产费用。　（李咏璇）
