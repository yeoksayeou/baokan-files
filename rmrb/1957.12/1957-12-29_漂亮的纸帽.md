    Pretty Paper Hats
    The New Year is coming soon. When you go to a costume party, you always want to dress up beautifully. Now, we introduce four types of homemade hats (see the bottom right picture). Everyone can make them themselves, which saves money and adds to the festive atmosphere.

    The raw materials for making these paper hats are very simple. You only need a few sheets of thicker white paper, colors, and pens, or various glossy colored papers. When making them, first draw according to the graphics, then cut them out with scissors, and then paste them into the shape of a hat with glue. If you use thick cardboard, you must first spray it with water. After it is damp, it will be soft and easy to fold into various shapes. Then, paint various beautiful colors on the cardboard, or use colored paper to paste various patterns, and a hat you love will be made.

    There are many different forms of hats, and everyone has different preferences. Let us create our own favorite paper hats for the New Year's party. (Ying) (Attached picture)

    漂亮的纸帽
    新年快要来到了。当你去参加化装舞会的时候，总希望把自己打扮得漂漂亮亮的。现在介绍四种自制的帽子（见右下图），大家可以自己动手来做，既省钱，又能增加节日的欢乐气氛。
    做这些纸帽的原料很简单，只用几张较厚的白纸、颜色和笔，或是用各种带光的色纸也可以。做时，先按照图形画好，然后用剪刀剪下，再用浆糊贴成帽子的形状。若用厚纸板做，须先喷水，俟潮湿后，它便柔软而容易折成各种形状。然后在硬纸板上涂上各种美丽的颜色，或用色纸裱糊各种花纹，一顶你心爱的帽子就做成了。
    帽子的形式是多种多样的，各人的喜爱也有所不同。让我们自己来创造自己心爱的新年晚会的纸帽吧。　（颖）（附图片）
