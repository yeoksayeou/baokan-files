　　Editor's Notes:
　　At present, a massive upsurge in production and construction is unfolding vigorously throughout the country. Laborers on the agricultural front are battling nature with unparalleled enthusiasm and boundless creativity, extracting more grain from the land. The initiative issued by these eight agricultural cooperatives in Hunan, aiming to achieve high yields of grain, fully expresses the determination and confidence of these pioneers in realizing a great leap forward in agricultural production next year.
　　From a nationwide perspective, inspired by the Agricultural Program, most regions have a clear direction and people are advancing vigorously. However, we must also see that some regions, due to vague directions and slow actions, are still dragging their feet and moving forward slowly. To achieve a nationwide great leap forward in production, we must accelerate these slower paces so that they can catch up with the advanced ranks. The initiative of the eight agricultural cooperatives in Hunan is a timely and creative move to drive everyone forward in unison.
　　Members of agricultural cooperatives! Respond to this enthusiastic initiative, participate in this friendly competition, and let everyone march forward in unison!

　　步伐一致地前进！
    目前，声势浩大的生产建设高潮，正在全国汹涌澎湃地展开。农业战线上的劳动者，正以无比的热情和无穷的创造力在和大自然搏斗，向土地索取更多的粮食。湖南这八个社发出的为实现粮食高额丰产的倡议书，充分表示了这些先行者对于实现明年农业生产大跃进的决心和信心。
    从全国范围来看，在农业纲要的鼓舞下大部地区已经有了明确的方向，人们正在生气勃勃地大踏步地前进；但是，我们还要看到，另有些地区由于方向模糊，动作迟缓，还在拖着有气无力的步子，缓缓地前进。要实现全国范围的生产大跃进，就一定要加速这些缓慢的步伐，使它们能赶上先进的行列。湖南八个社的倡议，正是带动大家一致前进的一项适时的创举。
    农业合作社的社员们！响应这个热烈的倡议，参加这个友谊的竞赛，让大家步伐一致地向前迈进！
