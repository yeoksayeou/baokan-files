Xinhua News Agency, December 25th: The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation sent a telegram congratulating the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, which opened in Cairo on the 26th. The text of the telegram is as follows: Asian-African Solidarity Conference:

    The Chinese youth and students welcome the convening of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference with great excitement and extend warm congratulations to the conference. We are pleased to see that after the Bandung Asian-African Conference, the unity and cooperation of the Asian-African people in the struggle to defend peace and oppose colonialism has undergone new development. As the future generation of the countries, the Asian-African youths and students have always stood heroically at the forefront of the struggle against colonialism, safeguarding national independence and sovereignty, and defending world peace. The Asian-African Student Conference in May 1956 was successfully held under the light of the Bandung spirit. The Asian-African youths will also make their own contributions to the cause of friendship and unity among Asian-African youths.
    The Chinese youth and students place earnest hopes on your conference, hoping that the conference will make an important contribution to further promoting the friendly unity of the Asian-African people. We sincerely wish the conference success.
              All-China Youth Federation
                All-China Students' Federation
