Xinhua News Agency, 20th -- In the Antarctic scientific exploration work involving eleven countries, Soviet scientists have achieved a new success. On December 16, the "Vostok" scientific station was established near the South Geomagnetic Pole, a place never before reached by humans. By land, it is more difficult to reach than the South Pole.

In early October, a Soviet scientific expedition consisting of twenty-seven scientists, with ample supplies and instruments, left the Soviet Antarctic scientific research base, "Mirny." After more than two months of effort, they crossed the snowfields where blizzards roared all day, established the "Komsomolskaya" auxiliary station along the way, trekked 1,400 kilometers, overcame countless difficulties, and finally reached their destination. On December 16, a grand flag-raising ceremony was held at the Soviet Union's new Antarctic scientific station. A bright red Soviet flag fluttered in a vast, silvery-white world. After arriving in this area, Soviet scientists immediately began scientific observation work and established regular radio communication with the "Mirny" Antarctic Observatory.

According to the International Geophysical Year plan, the "Vostok" scientific station will conduct regular scientific observations in meteorology, atmosphere, solar radiation measurement, glaciers, geomagnetism, ionosphere, and aurora, among other areas, this winter.

The Soviet exploration ship "Ob'" has recently arrived at "Mirny." In addition to carrying Soviet scientific workers, the "Ob'" also carried more than 4,000 tons of supplies and equipment. Another exploration ship, "Kooperatsiya," left the Soviet Union in early November to go to Antarctica. The ship is carrying more than one hundred and sixty scientific workers, as well as a large amount of supplies, scientific equipment, and transportation.

American scientists in Antarctica have been treated coldly by the US government. Paul Siple, the leader of the American Antarctic scientific base, said in early December that he had not received instructions from Washington regarding future work for a long time, which put him in a dilemma. He said dejectedly that if he did not receive such instructions in eight weeks, he would abandon all of the United States' scientific bases in Antarctica.

Accidents have also occurred continuously at the American scientific base in Antarctica. Since a helicopter accident occurred in mid-July, on October 26, another aircraft was forced to land on the Antarctic continent due to a malfunction. The seven people on board were trapped in the vast snowfield and unable to return to base. The US base sent planes to rescue them, but failed twice in a row. They were finally rescued in mid-November.

The British expedition crossing Antarctica is progressing. The exploration ship "Shackleton" suffered damage at the end of November in the Antarctic sea after colliding with ice floes.

Three Japanese scientists in Antarctica spent six days in late October climbing Botnnuten Peak, about 1,600 meters above sea level, near Harald Prince Bay. It is said to be the first time people have climbed this peak.

    南极美国科学家遭到政府的冷待
    杜费克说可能放弃全部科学基地
    新华社20日讯  在有十一个国家参加的南极科学考察工作中，苏联科学家又获得了一项新的成就，12月16日在人迹从来没有到过的南地磁极附近建立了“东方”科学站。这是南极大陆上距离海岸最远的地方。从陆路走，比到达南极点要困难得多。
    10月上旬，一个由二十七个科学家组成的苏联科学考察队，带着充分的给养和仪器，离开了苏联在南极的科学考察基地“和平村”。他们经过了两个多月的努力，穿过了暴风雪终日咆哮的雪原，在途中建立了一个“共青团”辅助站，他们跋涉了一千四百公里的路程，克服了无数困难，终于到达了目的地。12月16日这一天，在苏联新的南极科学站举行了隆重的升旗仪式。一面鲜红的苏联国旗，飘扬在一片白茫茫的银色世界上。苏联科学家到达这个地区后，立即开始了科学观测工作，并且同“和平村”南极观测站建立了定期的无线电联系。
    根据国际地球物理年的计划，“东方”科学站将在今冬对气象、大气、日光辐射测定、冰川、地磁、电离层和极光等各方面进行定期的科学观测。
    苏联考察船“鄂毕号”最近已经到达“和平村”。“鄂毕号”除了载来苏联科学工作者以外，还载来了四千多吨给养和装备。另一艘考察船“合作号”也已经在11月上旬离开苏联，前往南极。船上载着一百六十多个科学工作者以及大量给养、科学设备和运输工具。
    美国在南极的科学工作者遭到了美国政府的冷遇。美国南极科学基地的领导人杜费克在12月上旬说，他长时期来一直没有接到华盛顿关于将来工作的指示，这使他处在进退维谷的境地。他丧气地说，如果在八星期中还得不到这种指示的话，他将要放弃美国在南极的全部科学基地。
    在南极的美国科学基地上，还连续不断地发生了事故。自从7月中旬发生过一次直升飞机事故后，10月26日，一架飞机又因故障被迫降落在南极大陆上。机上七个人被困在茫茫的雪原上无法回返基地。美国基地曾派飞机前往营救，接连两次都没有成功，一直到11月中旬，才把他们救出来。
    英国横渡南极的考察队正在前进。考察船“沙克尔敦号”在11月底在南极海面上曾因碰撞浮冰而遭受损伤。
    日本在南极的三个科学工作者在10月下旬用六天的时间，爬上了哈拉德王子海湾附近的拔海约一千六百公尺的博脱奴登山峰。据说这是人们第一次登上这个山峰。
