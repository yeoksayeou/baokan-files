　　Water, Silk, and Friendship
    ——Two or Three Things About Uzbekistan
    Zhang Qing
    Not long ago, I visited the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, known as the "Land of White Gold" for its abundant cotton production. Its beautiful legends, simple customs, and sincere friendship left me with unforgettable impressions.
    The weather here is hot and dry, and in the past, water was extremely precious. Therefore, people often used it to symbolize eternal friendship and steadfast love. There is a myth about love and water that reflects the friendly traditions of ancient China and Central Asia.
    It is said that once upon a time, there was a young Chinese prince named Fa Han De, who, according to divine revelation, went to Central Asia to seek a beautiful maiden. He endured countless hardships in the boundless deserts and grasslands and finally met Queen Shi Lin, who was as beautiful as a celestial being. The queen was extremely distressed because she could not bring water into her country. Fa Han De led the queen's subjects in building a long canal, bringing life to the grasslands and deserts. The people, who had long suffered from drought, were grateful to the Chinese prince, and Queen Shi Lin also fell in love with the young man who had opened the river. The great fifteenth-century Uzbek poet Navoi wrote this legend in his immortal poem.
    The Uzbek people, who have struggled against drought for generations, have achieved brilliant victories in the Soviet era. Now, countless canals nourish the land of Uzbekistan. The Uzbek Republic's cotton production accounts for two-thirds of the entire Soviet Union's. In 1913, it only produced 518,000 tons of cotton, but this year it guarantees to deliver 3 million tons of cotton to the motherland.
    However, some customs still show the Uzbek people's deep affection for water. There is a saying here: the dust of May can bury people. But in the past, no one was willing to sprinkle water on the ground. Only during the melon festival in August, people would eat melons and sprinkle a few bowls of water on the ground to express their feelings. Now the dust is not as rampant as it used to be, but every August, every household still celebrates the melon festival, and large buckets of water are poured into the streets, forming small rivers along the way, where children play to their heart's content.
    Uzbek men like to sit in teahouses. I often go to teahouses as well. I have noticed that when local people pour tea, they only pour a little bit each time, just enough to cover the bottom of the bowl. An old man told me that this is a custom left over from the past, when water was extremely precious. Now, the reason for this is not because of a shortage of water, but to show respect to the guest.
    The Uzbek Republic is also famous for its sericulture, and its silk production accounts for half of the entire Soviet Union's. In the eastern part of the Republic, on the fertile Fergana Plain, I visited the homes of some collective farmers who raise silkworms.
    The Fergana Plain in early summer is very beautiful. Cotton seedlings, mulberry groves, and alfalfa paint the land in lush green. The red silk dresses of the women in the fields reflect the May sunshine, like fiery red flowers blooming in the green fields.
    It is said that during the Tsarist era, most of the silk from Uzbekistan was shipped to France or Italy. Women mostly wore coarse cloth clothing, and if they wanted to wear silk, they had to pay a high price to buy foreign goods. Now, silk is woven into beautiful satin in local factories, and the price is not much more expensive than cotton cloth. Women in silkworm-raising families mostly wear large red and green silk dresses, woven with cloud patterns, and wear small black vests on top. The old people said with a smile, "The October Revolution has dressed our Uzbek women even more beautifully."
    People attach great importance to silkworm rearing. When the weather gets hot, many collective farm members build sheds more than ten feet high in their yards, and people sleep under the sheds at night, also to free up the houses for raising silkworms. Inside the house, silkworms eat mulberry leaves on wooden racks divided into two or three layers, and a thermometer hangs on the rack, with the top of the mercury column always staying around twenty-three degrees.
    When I said goodbye to the Fergana Plain, a female chairman of a collective farm gave me an Uzbek-style soft satin red shirt and told me a story circulating in Uzbekistan: In ancient times, a Chinese princess married the Uzbek king, and several thousand bolts of silk were her dowry. The princess distributed it to the people. In order to be able to wear beautiful clothes forever, people began to raise silkworms...
    "If this is a gift, then it is given to the Chinese people, thanking them for passing on sericulture to us."
    I hugged her tightly, for the infinite affection represented by the precious gift.

### 水·蚕丝·友情——乌兹别克斯坦二三事

　　水·蚕丝·友情
    ——乌兹别克斯坦二三事
    张擎
    不久以前，我访问了因盛产棉花而被誉为“白金之国”的苏联乌兹别克共和国。它的美丽的传说、淳朴的习俗和真挚的友情，给我留下了难忘的印象。
    这里天气燥热，在过去，水是异常珍贵的，因此人们常拿它来比喻永恒的友谊和坚贞的爱情。有一个关于爱情和水的神话，反映了古代中国和中亚的友好传统。
    据说从前中国有个青年王子名叫法汉德，根据神的启示，到中亚细亚去寻访一位美丽的姑娘。他在无边的沙漠和草原上历尽千辛万苦，终于遇到了天仙般的石琳女王。女王正因为无法把水引进她的国土而万分苦恼。法汉德率领女王的臣民，修了一条长长的运河，给草原和沙漠带来了生命。久为干旱所苦的人们都感激中国王子，女王石琳也爱上了这位开河的少年。十五世纪乌兹别克斯坦的伟大诗人诺瓦伊，曾把这个传说写在他不朽的诗篇里。
    世世代代同干旱作斗争的乌兹别克人民，在苏维埃政权年代里取得了辉煌的胜利。现在，无数条河渠哺育着乌兹别克斯坦的土地。乌兹别克共和国的棉花产量占全苏联的三分之二。1913年它只产棉五十一万八千吨，今年它保证要交给祖国三百万吨棉花。
    但是，至今还有些习俗表现了乌兹别克人对于水的深厚感情。这里有句俗语：五月的尘土可以埋人。但是在从前，谁也舍不得用水泼地，只有在八月瓜节的时候，人们一边吃甜瓜，一边洒几碗水在地上，聊表自己的心意。现在尘土已不像过去那样猖狂肆虐，可是每逢八月，家家户户照例要过瓜节，大桶的水泼到街上，沿路汇成小河，孩子们就在水边尽情地嬉戏。
    乌兹别克斯坦的男人喜欢坐茶馆。我也常到茶馆去坐。我发现本地人倒茶时，每次只倒一点点，浅浅地刚盖着碗底。一位老人告诉我，这是从前遗留下来的习惯，那时水是异常珍贵的。现在所以还是这样，倒不是因为缺水，而是表示对客人的尊敬。
    乌兹别克共和国的养蚕业也很有名，蚕丝产量占全苏联的一半。在共和国东部，在富饶的费尔干平原上，我访问了一些养蚕的集体农民的家庭。
    初夏的费尔干平原是十分美丽的。棉芽、桑林和苜蓿把大地染成一片翠绿。田野上妇女们的红色绸衫映着五月的阳光，就像盛开在绿色原野上的火红花朵。
    据说在沙皇时代，乌兹别克斯坦的蚕丝大部分运销法国或意大利。妇女们大都是粗衣布服，要穿绸料，就得出高价买外国货。现在，蚕丝就在当地工厂织成了漂亮的绸缎，价钱比棉布贵不了多少。养蚕人家的妇女们大都穿着大红大绿的绸衫，上面织着云字花纹，外面套着黑色小坎肩。老人们笑着说：“十月革命把我们乌兹别克斯坦的女人打扮得更漂亮了。”
    人们对养蚕是很重视的。天气热了，很多集体农庄庄员的院子里都搭着一丈来高的凉棚，人们晚上就在凉棚下睡觉，同时也是为了把屋子腾出来养蚕。在屋子里，蚕在分成两、三层的木架上吃着桑叶，架上挂着温度表，水银柱的顶端总是停留在二十三度上下。
    当我向费尔干平原告别的时候，一位集体农庄女主席送给我一件乌兹别克式的软缎红衫，同时讲了一个流传在乌兹别克斯坦的故事：古代中国一位公主嫁给了乌兹别克王，几千匹绸缎是她的嫁妆。公主把它分给了人民。人们为了永远能够穿到漂亮衣服，就开始养蚕了……。
    “如果说这是礼物的话，那末它是送给中国人民的，感谢他们把养蚕业传给了我们。”
    我紧紧地拥抱她，为了那珍贵的礼物所代表的无限深情。
