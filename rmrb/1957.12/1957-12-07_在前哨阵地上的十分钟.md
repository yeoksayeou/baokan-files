　　Ten Minutes on the Outpost
　　By Yu Yiting, a soldier of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers

　　"Good! One more time!" A colonel and a major were competing in a test of strength. The colonel lost the first time, and the comrades were cheering for their leader. So, the colonel gripped the major's hand again and the competition restarted. It looked as if the colonel's hand couldn't take it, but he gritted his teeth and held on! The comrades were laughing and shouting as they watched this tense test of strength. This colonel was our deputy director, and his hair was almost white, but his straight back showed the unique military bearing of this veteran of the Long March. His weather-beaten face always gave people a kind and approachable feeling. Whether they were officers or soldiers, they were willing to approach him and say a few words to him.

　　"No! One more time!" This was the powerful support of the comrades after the colonel lost the second time. This invigorated the colonel, who wanted to compete with the major for the third time. So, two strong hands were tightly clasped together again. You might think that this major, who had won twice in a row, was a young and strong lad? No, he was also a veteran, and had been in the army for twenty-four years! A long underground struggle and a life of intense revolutionary war made his appearance very inconsistent with his forty-two years of age. His face was full of wrinkles, and his hair had begun to fall out. At first glance, the major's age would not even be younger than the colonel's.

　　The colonel finally lost the third time. Panting, he said with a smile, "If I didn't have a bone missing, I might have won three times in a row!" As he spoke, he rolled up the sleeve of his right hand. In that instant, what appeared before the comrades' eyes was the huge, wrinkled scar below the elbow of the colonel's right hand, where a bone was missing! In that minute, the colonel's right arm, which was missing a bone, brought the comrades into those days and nights of battle, and no one spoke.

　　I don't know which mischievous fellow, perhaps to break this uncomfortable silence, said to the leader, "Comrade Director, if your right hand doesn't work, use your left hand to compete!" The colonel said with a smile, "The left hand doesn't work either!" As he spoke, he rolled up the sleeve of his left hand and pointed to his elbow, saying, "Look, this isn't complete either!" Wasn't it? Half of the joint was missing!

　　This small slice of life happened during the ten-minute break of the general meeting on the afternoon of November 1, 1957, at the outpost defending the motherland and world peace.

　　在前哨阵地上的十分钟
    志愿军某部　喻一挺
    “好！再来一次！”一位上校和一位少校正在比赛握力。第一次上校失败了，同志们在替自己的首长助威。于是，上校同志又握住了少校的手，又重新比赛起来了，眼看着上校的手吃不住劲了，但只见他一咬牙，抵住啦！同志们都在欢笑着、喊着看这场紧张的握力比赛，这位上校，是我们的副部长，他头发都快苍白了，但挺直的腰干，显示着这位经过二万五千里长征的老战士的特有的军人风度，他那张饱经风霜的脸始终给人以和蔼可亲的感觉，不管是军官或士兵都愿意和他接近，愿意和他说几句话。
    “不行！再来一次！”这是同志们在上校第二次比赛失败后的有力的支援的呼声。这使上校同志又抖擞起精神，要和少校同志作第三次比赛。于是，两只有力的手又紧紧的握在一起了。你也许以为这位连胜两次的少校同志是一位年青力壮的小伙子吧？不是的，这也是一位老战士，他入伍已经二十四年了！长期的地下斗争生涯和紧张的革命战争生活使他的面貌和他那四十二岁的年龄很不相称，满脸皱纹，头发都开始脱落了。猛一看，少校的年龄甚至不会比上校小。
    上校终于第三次失败了。他喘着气，笑着说：“要不是少了一根骨头，说不定我还可以连中三元呢！”他一面说着，一面卷起右手的衣袖，在这一刹那，出现在同志们眼前的是上校同志右手肘下那一块凹进去的四周起皱的巨大的伤疤！在这一分钟里，上校同志那缺少了一根骨头的右臂把同志们带进了那战斗的白天和黑夜，没有一个人说话了。
    不知是那一个调皮鬼，也许是为了打破这难受的沉默吧？对首长说：“部长同志你右手不行用左手来比吧！”上校同志笑着对他说：“左手也不行啊！”说着，他卷起了左手的衣袖，指着肘说：“你看，这也不完全啊！”不是吗？关节已经有半个没有了！
    这个小小的生活片断，发生在1957年11月1日下午大会休息的十分钟里，地点是在保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的前哨阵地上。
