Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe's Speech

Respected Premier Zhou Enlai and dear friends:

Today, my wife, the delegation I lead, and I are about to leave China. As we bid farewell to you all, although we are about to leave lovely China, our hearts remain with you.

From the moment we set foot on Chinese soil, the Chinese leaders and the Chinese people have given us a very warm welcome and reception, just like relatives. Therefore, we do not feel like we have arrived in a foreign country at all, but rather as if we have arrived at the home of relatives and friends. Although the weather in China is cold, due to the warm and cordial reception of the Chinese people, we do not feel cold at all; on the contrary, we feel warm.

From the time we arrived in China until now, as we are about to leave, our elder brother, dear Premier Zhou Enlai, and other leaders have given us a very kind reception. At the same time, local leaders have also given us a warm, relative-like reception, and the people of various places have welcomed us like relatives and "Pauk Phaws." We will never forget all of this.

From the time of our ancestors, the Burmese people have regarded the Chinese people as their relatives and "Pauk Phaws." During this visit, we have personally seen that the Chinese people also regard us as friendly relatives and "Pauk Phaws." The friendly relationship between our two countries is not an ordinary friendly relationship, but a kinship-like friendly relationship, and the friendly relationship between the peoples of the two countries is also a kinship-like relationship. This is something that no one can deny.

As I said just now, the friendly relationship between our two countries and peoples is not the relationship of ordinary friendly countries, but a kinship-like friendly relationship. Moreover, the friendship between our two countries is based on the Five Principles and mutual understanding, and therefore it is becoming increasingly consolidated. We are working side by side for the common interests of the peoples of both countries and for peace in Asia and the world.

Our visit to China this time is very short. Just as we were becoming good friends, we are about to leave. I would very much like to make some visits and inspections in China. I hope to see you again, at which time you will no longer be my new friends but my old friends, and at that time, I will also meet more new friends. For this reason, I will visit China again soon and inspect the construction of advanced China.

Now, we are about to leave. At this time, our hearts are full of reluctance, and I will bring back the friendship of the Chinese people.

The friendship between our two countries is solid, and I believe that Myanmar and China will work together side by side for the consolidation of peace in Asia and world peace.

### 吴巴瑞副总理的讲话

　　吴巴瑞副总理的讲话敬爱的周恩来总理和各位亲爱的朋友：
    今天我和我的夫人和我率领的代表团就要离开中国了。在我们和大家分别的时候，虽然我们快要离开可爱的中国，但是我们的感情却仍然和你们在一起。
    在我们一踏上中国的土地后，中国的领导人和中国人民就像亲戚一般地给我们非常温暖的欢迎和接待，因此，我们一点也不感到是到了外国，而完全好像到了亲戚和朋友家里一样。虽然中国的天气是寒冷的，但是由于中国人民亲切而温暖的接待，我们不但不感到寒冷，相反，却感到温暖。
    从我们到达中国的时候开始，一直到现在离开为止，我们的老大哥，亲爱的周恩来总理和其他领导人，给我们非常亲切的接待。同时，各地领导人也给我们温暖的亲戚般的接待，各地人民也像亲戚和“胞波”一样欢迎我们。对所有这些，我们是决不会忘记的。
    从我们祖先开始，缅甸人民就把中国人民当作自己的亲戚和“胞波”一样看待。在这次访问中，我们亲眼看到中国人民同样的把我们看成是友好的亲戚和“胞波”。我们两国之间的友好关系，不是一般的友好关系，而是亲戚般的友好关系，两国人民之间的友好关系，也是亲戚般的关系。这点，是谁也不能否认的。
    正如我刚才所说的，我们两国和人民的友好关系，不是普通友好国家的关系，而是亲戚般的友好关系，不仅如此，我们两国之间的友谊，还是建筑在五项原则和相互了解的基础上，因此就日益巩固。我们并正在并肩为两国人民的共同利益、为亚洲和世界和平而奋斗。
    这次我们到中国访问的时间很短，正当我们刚成为好朋友的时候，我们就要离开了。我是很想在中国作一些访问和考察的。我希望再一次和诸位相见，那时你们不再是我的新朋友而将是我的老朋友了，那时，我也将认识更多的新朋友。为此，我在不久后将再次来中国访问，并考察先进的中国的建设情况。
    现在，我们就要离开了。这时候，我们心里充满着惜别的心情，我将把中国人民的情谊带回去。
    我们两国的友谊是巩固的，我相信缅中两国将并肩为亚洲和平和世界和平的巩固而共同奋斗。（附图片）
