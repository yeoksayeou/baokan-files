Artificial Abortion is Harmful
Song Hongzhao

Artificial abortion, also called scraping the uterus, is a surgical method to remove the early embryo. Because this is a method of forcibly terminating pregnancy, it is different from natural abortion and has many disadvantages.

Currently, some female comrades do not understand the harm of artificial abortion enough. They think that contraception is too troublesome, so it is easier to go to the hospital for artificial abortion after pregnancy. Therefore, they insist on asking doctors to perform artificial abortion again and again, which is very dangerous.

First of all, only part of the operation of artificial abortion can be performed under visible light, and the rest is mostly operated through the feeling obtained by the instrument. Therefore, if the pregnant woman's uterus size, depth, position and inclination are slightly abnormal, or the operator's skills are not skilled enough, it will cause damage to the uterus or bleeding and infection due to incomplete scraping.

Second, during pregnancy, all important organs of women undergo great changes to adapt to the growth of the embryo. Artificial abortion—suddenly removing the embryo—prevents many changes in the important organs from adapting, and they must be quickly readjusted in a very short period of time. If the adjustment is not timely, the function of the organs may be disordered. Therefore, even if there is no danger at the time of the operation, many complications may occur after the abortion. Common symptoms include menstrual disorders, breast atrophy, decreased libido, long-term inability to recover physical strength, and unexplained dull pain in the lower abdomen. The more times artificial abortion is performed, the more opportunities for illness occur, and some are ineffective after a long period of treatment.

Third, after artificial abortion, if the body health is not affected, you can get pregnant again in a few months. If you have another artificial abortion at this time, one more operation will mean one more danger and one more pain. If you do not have an artificial abortion again, you will still have a child, and you will suffer one more pain and take one more risk in vain.

Of course, if a woman suffers from certain diseases, continued pregnancy will worsen the condition or even affect her life. At this time, although there is a danger in performing artificial abortion, the harm caused by continued pregnancy is less. In this unavoidable situation, artificial abortion can sometimes be used.

In order to properly solve the problem of regulating fertility, we can only use contraception, which is both reliable and safe, while artificial abortion is not worth the loss.

### 人工流产害处多

　　人工流产害处多
　　宋鸿钊
    人工流产、又叫做刮子宫，就是用手术的方法把早期的胚胎取下来。由于这是一种强制中断妊娠的方法，和自然流产不一样，害处很多。
    目前有些女同志对人工流产的害处还了解不够，她们认为避孕太麻烦，不如等有了孕再去医院进行人工流产比较省事，因此一次又一次坚持要求医生进行人工流产，这是很危险的。
    首先，人工流产这种手术的操作，只有一部分能在目力看得见的情况下进行，其余多是通过器械所得的感觉而操作的。因此，如果孕妇的子宫大小、深浅、位置和斜度等稍有异常，或操作者技术不够熟练，就会发生损伤子宫或因刮不净而造成流血和感染等危险。
    第二，在怀孕的时候，妇女全身各重要器官都起着很大的变化，以适应胚胎的生长。而人工流产——突然把胚胎取去，则各重要器官的许多变化就无法适应，必须在极短期内迅速重行调整，如调整不及就有发生器官功能紊乱的可能。因此，人工流产即使在手术当时没有发生危险，而流产以后，还可能发生许多并发症。其中常见的有月经不调、乳房萎缩、性欲减退、体力长期不能恢复，以及下腹无名隐痛等症状。人工流产的次数愈多，则发病的机会也愈多，有的经过很久也治疗无效。
    第三，人工流产以后，如果身体健康不受影响，过不了几个月，还可以再受孕。此时如果再做人工流产，多一次手术就多一次危险，也多一次痛苦。如不再行人工流产，则仍然有了孩子，徒然多受一次痛苦和多冒一次危险。
    当然，如果妇女患有某些疾病，继续妊娠将使病情恶化或甚至影响生命，此时进行人工流产虽有危险，但是比起继续妊娠时将发生的害处要小些。在这种不得已的情况下，有时也可采用人工流产。
    为了妥善地解决调节生育的问题，我们只有用避孕的方法，才是既可靠又安全，而人工流产是得不偿失的。
