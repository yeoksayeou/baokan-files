Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, December 17th: Fang Zhi, a special agent boss of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, is currently engaged in political activities in Hong Kong that are hostile to and oppose the new China.

The special agent boss Fang Zhi arrived in Hong Kong on the 11th under the guise of the so-called "General Relief Association for Mainland Disaster Compatriots." It was announced that the purpose of his visit was to "assist the Hong Kong government in relief work." According to newspaper revelations, the special agent organization headed by Fang Zhi—the so-called "General Relief Association for Mainland Disaster Compatriots"—has established special agent organizations called "Refugee Autonomous Associations" in the urban areas of Hong Kong and Kowloon, as well as in the suburbs of Tsuen Wan, Ma On Shan, and Tiu Keng Leng. Fang Zhi has been in contact with the responsible persons of these special agent organizations in recent days, and has also been in extensive contact with "people from all walks of life" in Hong Kong, especially with Xie Bochang and Yin Zhizhong of the "Kowloon General Chamber of Commerce" and other "industrial and commercial figures" who openly support the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

According to Hong Kong newspaper reports, Fang Zhi was one of the masterminds behind the Kowloon riots in October of last year and the Tsuen Wan massacre. During the Kowloon riots, he used the name of the "General Relief Association for Mainland Disaster Compatriots" to allocate 150,000 Hong Kong dollars to "comfort" the Chiang Kai-shek clique's special agents in Hong Kong.

Fang Zhi, a special agent boss of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, has frequently come to Hong Kong in recent years to carry out criminal activities. In August and September of this year, after Fang Zhi and Zheng Yanfen, another special agent boss of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, came to Hong Kong one after the other, a large-scale smuggling case of American-made military supplies that shocked Hong Kong and Kowloon occurred. The Hong Kong "Insider News" published an editorial on the 13th, pointing out that Fang Zhi and his so-called "General Relief Association for Mainland Disaster Compatriots" are "using relief as a pretext to create disasters in reality" and "doing everything that is inhumane and violates conscience."

People here generally suspect what relationship the British authorities in Hong Kong, led by Grantham, have with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and why they are so tolerant of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's special agent boss openly engaging in political activities in Hong Kong that are hostile to and oppose the new China.

### 九龙暴乱事件幕后主谋之一  特务头子方治又到香港活动

    九龙暴乱事件幕后主谋之一
    特务头子方治又到香港活动
    新华社香港17日电　蒋介石集团的特务头子方治目前正在香港进行敌视和反对新中国的政治活动。
    特务头子方治是以所谓“大陆灾胞救济总会”的名义在11日到达香港的。据宣布，他此来的目的是“协助香港政府从事救济工作”。据报纸揭露，方治主持的特务机构——所谓“大陆灾胞救济总会”，在香港、九龙市区和荃湾、马鞍山、调景岭等郊区都设有名为“难民自治会”的特务组织。方治连日来都和这些特务组织的负责人员联络，并且同香港的“各界人士”广泛接触，同公开支持蒋介石集团的“九龙总商会”的谢伯昌、尹致中等“工商界人士”的联络尤为密切。
    据香港报纸揭露，方治是去年10月九龙暴乱事件及血洗荃湾大惨案的幕后主谋之一。在九龙暴乱事件中，他曾以“大陆灾胞救济总会”的名义拨款十五万元港币来“慰问”在香港的蒋介石集团特务分子。
    蒋介石集团的特务头子方治近年来时常来香港进行罪恶活动，今年8、9月间，方治和蒋介石集团的另一个特务头子郑彦棻先后来过香港之后，轰动港九的大规模偷运美制军火案就发生了。香港的“内幕新闻报”13日曾发表社论，指出方治和他的所谓“大陆灾胞救济总会”是“假救济之名，行造灾之实”，“尽做些没有人性，违背良心”的勾当。
    这里的一般人士怀疑，以葛量洪为首的香港英国当局究竟同蒋介石集团有什么关系，为什么这样容忍蒋介石集团的特务头子在香港公开进行敌视和反对新中国的政治活动。
