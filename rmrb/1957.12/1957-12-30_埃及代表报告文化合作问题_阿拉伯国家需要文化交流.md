Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 27th: Egyptian writer Dr. Taha Hussein stated at the afternoon plenary session of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference on the 27th that "Egypt believes in free culture and believes that culture should be collected from all its sources. Egypt urgently hopes to restore the ancient cultural heritage of Arabs and Muslims, and hopes to spread the culture of other countries' people to all regions of the Arab world."

In his report on cultural cooperation, Hussein said that Egypt's cultural cooperation with the world can be traced back to the Pharaonic era of ancient Egypt and has continued through the subsequent Roman and Muslim eras. He also mentioned Egypt's contribution to maintaining and disseminating Arab culture.

Dr. Hussein said that Arab countries have made great efforts to restore and maintain the Arabic language, despite imperialist attempts to undermine these efforts. He added that Arab countries are currently competing to restore the cultural heritage of Muslims and Arabs, and to make Arabic a language of science, culture, and philosophy. He also said, "Egypt, like the people of Asian and African countries, also hopes to learn from each other and exchange knowledge." He mentioned that many foreign students are currently studying at Egyptian universities, and more than 3,000 Egyptian teachers are teaching in other countries.

    埃及代表报告文化合作问题
    阿拉伯国家需要文化交流
    新华社开罗27日电　埃及著名作家塔哈·侯赛尼博士在亚非团结大会27日下午全体会议上说，“埃及相信自由的文化，并且认为文化应该从它的一切来源来搜集。埃及迫切希望恢复阿拉伯和穆斯林的古代文化遗产，并且希望把其他国家人民的文化传播到阿拉伯世界各个地区。”
    侯赛尼在他所作的关于文化合作的报告中说，埃及同全世界的文化合作可以上溯到公元前埃及的法老时代，并且在随后的罗马和穆斯林时代一直继续了下来。他还提到了埃及对维护和传播阿拉伯文化的贡献。
    侯赛尼博士说，阿拉伯国家在恢复和维护阿拉伯语言方面作了很大的努力，尽管帝国主义企图破坏这种努力。他又说，阿拉伯国家目前正在竞相恢复穆斯林和阿拉伯的文化遗产，以及使阿拉伯文成为科学、文化和哲学的语言。他还说，“埃及和亚非各国人民一样，也希望互相学习和交流知识。”他提到目前有许多外国学生在埃及大学学习，有三千多个埃及教师在其他国家任教。
