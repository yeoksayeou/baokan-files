Comrade Chairman and fellow delegates:

First, on behalf of our organization—the Central Trade Union of the Republic of Indonesia—I would like to express our gratitude to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for inviting us to attend this conference, our gratitude to the Chinese government for its warm welcome, and our heartfelt thanks for the warm hospitality I have received during my stay in Beijing.

Second, having personally listened to the congratulatory speech made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the work report made by Comrade Lai Ruoyu on behalf of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, many of the issues raised require serious study, because many of these issues, and the solutions to many practical problems, are ones we have not yet encountered. Therefore, I should humbly and sincerely learn more from our Chinese worker brothers, whether it is in formulating ways to solve practical problems, or in practical experience regarding leadership methods, criticism and self-criticism, and self-education. I am deeply convinced that under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and following the guidelines expounded by Comrade Lai Ruoyu, you will achieve success in your future work of building China. The completion of your aforementioned tasks is the result of the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the superiority of socialism, combined with the revolutionary, fighting, frugal, and tested traditions and qualities of the Chinese people, who have rich experience and humility. I am deeply convinced that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the tasks of realizing the Second Five-Year Plan, as put forward by Comrade Zhou Enlai at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, will achieve good results.

Third, I fully agree with what Comrade Liu Shaoqi and Comrade Lai Ruoyu said at the conference, and with the principles of the Chinese people in international relations as expounded in the resolutions of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, especially in developing friendly relations between Asian and African countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Countries should provide mutual assistance in the struggle for national independence against colonialism, and strengthen ties between workers around the world on the principles of proletarian international solidarity, equality, and opposition to great-nation chauvinism. This is also your policy.

Fourth, I feel it is necessary to briefly introduce here the current demands and basic tasks of the Indonesian people, in order to promote mutual understanding and strengthen proletarian international solidarity. At present, the Indonesian people are engaged in an arduous struggle to eliminate and end colonialism and feudalism in Indonesia, especially in its economy, which is in line with the requirements of the August 1945 Revolution. At present, the Indonesian people are waging a fierce struggle to liberate the territory of Indonesia—West Irian—which is occupied by the troops of Dutch imperialism. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution refusing to accept the proposal put forward by Asian and African countries, hoping that the Dutch government would be willing to negotiate with the Indonesian government on the West Irian issue. After this, the Dutch government sent a large number of troops to West Irian and the borders of Indonesia.

At present, the Indonesian people are preparing to liberate West Irian, which is occupied by the Netherlands. The day before I left Indonesia, all Indonesian workers working in all Dutch enterprises (including members of the Central Trade Union of All Indonesia, the United Trade Union of Indonesian Civil Rights, the Central Trade Union of the Republic of Indonesia, the Federation of Indonesian Trade Unions, the Indonesian Trade Union Federation, the Indonesian Islamic Trade Union, the All Indonesian Muslim Trade Union, etc.) went on a five-minute strike. Now, I have heard that Indonesian workers have carried out the second phase of action, and they have carried out a continuous twenty-four-hour strike in all Dutch enterprises. The Indonesian people are now actively resisting the Dutch. In short, the Indonesian people are united in the struggle to liberate West Irian.

I believe that the Chinese workers and the workers of the world who love independence and oppose colonialism will surely support our struggle to destroy colonialism in Indonesia and liberate the Indonesian territory of West Irian, which is occupied by Dutch imperialists. Your support will surely strengthen the common struggle against colonialism and to defend world peace.

Thank you.

Long live the Chinese workers as the leading class!

Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

Long live the close friendship between Chinese workers and Indonesian workers!

Long live the solidarity of workers around the world!

Long live the socialist countries and the people's democratic countries!

Long live world peace!

    印度尼西亚共和国中央职工会代表
    哈沁·达利夫致词尊敬的主席同志和各位代表：
    首先，我代表我们的组织——印度尼西亚共和国中央职工会——向邀请我们前来参加这个大会的中华全国总工会表示感谢，对中国政府的热烈欢迎表示感谢，并对我在北京期间所受到的亲切款待，表示衷心感谢。
    其次，我亲自听到了刘少奇同志代表中国共产党中央委员会所作的祝词和赖若愚同志代表中华全国总工会执行委员会所作的工作报告，对其中的许多问题需要认真研究，因为许多问题，以及对许多实际问题的解决，都是我们所未曾遇到过的。因此，我应当虚心诚意地多多向中国工人兄弟学习，不论是拟定解决实际问题的方式，或者是在关于领导方法、批评和自我批评、自我教育等方面的实际经验。我深信：在中国共产党中央委员会的领导下，并遵循着赖若愚同志所阐述的方针，你们在今后建设中国的工作中是会取得成就的。你们上述任务的完成，是中国共产党的领导，社会主义的优越性，同具有丰富经验和虚心的中国人民的革命的、战斗的、勤俭的、经得起考验的传统和品质相结合的结果。我深信：在中国共产党的领导下，周恩来同志在中国共产党第八次代表大会上所提出的实现第二个五年计划的任务，将会取得良好的成就。
    第三，我完全同意刘少奇同志、赖若愚同志在大会上讲的，以及中国共产党第八次代表大会决议中所阐述的关于中国人民在国际关系方面的方针，特别是在和平共处五项原则的基础上发展亚非国家的友好联系。各国在民族独立斗争中应该进行互助来反对殖民主义，并在无产阶级国际团结的原则，在平等和反对大民族主义的原则的基础上，加强全世界工人之间的联系。这也是你们的方针。
    第四，我觉得有必要在这里略为介绍一下印度尼西亚人民当前的要求和基本任务，以便相互了解和加强无产阶级的国际团结。目前印度尼西亚人民正在为消灭和结束在印度尼西亚的、尤其是在它的经济方面的殖民主义和封建主义而进行艰苦的斗争，这是符合1945年8月革命的要求的。目前印度尼西亚人民正在为解放被荷兰帝国主义军队占领着的印度尼西亚的领土——西伊里安而展开剧烈的斗争。联合国大会通过决议，拒绝接受亚非国家所提出的希望荷兰政府愿意同印度尼西亚政府就西伊里安问题进行谈判的建议。在这之后，荷兰政府派了大量军队前往西伊里安和印度尼西亚的邻境。
    目前印度尼西亚人民正在准备解放被荷兰所占领的西伊里安。当我离开印度尼西亚的前一天，在所有的荷兰企业中工作的全体印度尼西亚工人（包括全印度尼西亚中央职工会、印度尼西亚民权统一工会、印度尼西亚共和国中央职工会、印度尼西亚职工会联合会、印度尼西亚工会联合会、印度尼西亚伊斯兰教工会、全印度尼西亚穆斯林工会等工会的会员）进行了五分钟的罢工。现在，我听说印度尼西亚工人已进行了第二阶段的行动，他们在所有的荷兰企业中进行了连续二十四小时的罢工。印度尼西亚人民现在正在积极地抵制荷兰人。总而言之，印度尼西亚人民正在团结一致地为解放西伊里安而斗争。
    我相信，热爱独立和反对殖民主义的中国工人和全世界工人，必将支援我们为摧毁在印度尼西亚的殖民主义和解放被荷兰帝国主义者所占领的印度尼西亚领土——西伊里安而进行的斗争。你们的支援一定会增强反对殖民主义和保卫世界和平的共同斗争。
    谢谢。
    作为领导阶级的中国工人万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
    中国工人和印度尼西亚工人之间的亲密友谊万岁！
    全世界工人团结万岁！
    社会主义国家和人民民主国家万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
