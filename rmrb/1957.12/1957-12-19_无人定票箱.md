    "Unmanned Ticket Booking Box"
    My friend and I were strolling along Zhongshan Road. Inadvertently, we saw a crowd of people gathered in front of the Trust Company Square, and we were curious to join in the fun. Upon closer inspection, it turned out that everyone was attracted by a red wooden box hanging on the wall – the "Unmanned Ticket Booking Box" – and were discussing it. It was recently set up by the Shijiazhuang Railway Station to facilitate ticket purchases for passengers. It is said that one was also set up at the People's Bank of China office on Jiefang Road. The box states that passengers who need to buy train tickets only need to write down the date, train number, destination, number of tickets, and their detailed address on a note and drop it into the ticket booking box. The station will then deliver the tickets to the passengers. Furthermore, the box also indicates that it will be opened twice a day. (Shijiazhuang Chen Baoxin)

    “无人定票箱”
    我和朋友在中山路上蹓跶。无意间，看到信托公司广场前挤了一堆人，我们也好奇地过去凑个热闹。走近一看，原来大家都是被挂在墙上的一个红色木箱——“无人定票箱”吸引着，并且议论纷纷。它是石家庄车站新近为了便于旅客买票乘车而设置的，据说在解放路人民银行办事处也设置了一个。箱子上说明，需要买火车票的旅客，只要用一张便条，写明自己准备乘坐火车的日期、车次、到达站名、车票张数和本人详细住址，投入订票箱内，车站就可以把车票送到旅客手里。并且，箱上还说明了每天开箱两次。　（石家庄　陈宝新）
