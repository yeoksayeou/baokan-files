    Debate on the Research Object of National Economic History

    The question of the research object of national economic history has recently sparked debate in economic circles.

    The second issue of Economic Research in 1957 published Sun Jian's paper, entitled "The Object, Method, and Task of National Economic History." The author disagrees with the view of П·И·Lyashenko, the author of Soviet National Economic History, namely: "The object of national economic history is to study the development of production, to study the new and old alternations of production methods over thousands of years, and to study the development of productive forces and people's relations of production." Because: productive forces belong to the technical aspect of production, and production technology is the object of investigation by other sciences; the purpose of national economic history's investigation of productive forces is only to explain the evolution of production relations; national economic history is a science with class nature and party spirit, while productive forces have no class nature.

    This paper aroused the interest of researchers of national economic history. Before this paper was published, discussions were held in the National Economic History Teaching and Research Offices of Renmin University and Peking University respectively, and most people still supported Comrade Lyashenko's point of view.

    The fourth issue of the Journal of Humanities of Northeast People's University in 1957 published Shao Jingxun's paper "The Object, Task, and Method of National Economic History." The article on the one hand criticized Comrade Lyashenko's definition as "appearing general and vague" and "unable to express the national and specific nature of national economic history research"; at the same time, it basically supported his argument, believing: "His affirmation that the study of national economic history is both the study of production relations and the study of productive forces is correct." Shao Jingxun believes that national economic history is the history of the economic activities of the entire people, especially the vast majority of working people in the country, the most important of which is to discuss the history of the occurrence and development of productive forces in industry and agriculture and production relations in industry and agriculture, that is, it should study the history of the occurrence and development of social production methods, which requires a comprehensive study of productive forces and production relations and their interrelationships. The discussion of productive forces and production relations should "not be biased."

    关于国民经济史研究对象的争论
    关于国民经济史研究的对象问题，近来在经济学界引起了争论。
    1957年第二期经济研究发表了孙健的论文，题目是“国民经济史的对象、方法和任务”。作者不同意苏联国民经济史的作者П·И·勒雅申柯的见解，即：“国民经济史的对象，乃是研究生产的发展，研究数千百年来新旧更替的生产方式、研究生产力与人们生产关系的发展。”因为：生产力属于生产的技术方面，生产技术是其他科学考察的对象；国民经济史考察生产力，其目的只是为了说明生产关系的演变；国民经济史是一门具有阶级性、党性的科学，而生产力是没有阶级性的。
    这篇论文引起了国民经济史研究者的兴趣。这篇论文还未发表前，在人民大学和北京大学国民经济史教研室都分别举行过讨论，大多数人仍然支持勒雅申柯同志的论点。
    1957年第四期东北人民大学人文科学学报发表了邵敬勋的“国民经济史的对象任务和方法”的论文。文中一方面批评了勒雅申柯同志所下的定义，“显得笼统和一般化”，“不能表达出国民经济史研究的国别性和具体性”；同时又基本上支持了他的论点，认为：“他肯定国民经济史的研究，既是研究生产关系而又研究生产力的，这点是正确的。”邵敬勋认为，国民经济史就是全国人民，特别是占全国最大多数劳动人民的经济活动史，其中最主要的要论述工农业的生产力与在工农业中生产关系发生发展的历史，即应当研究社会生产方式发生发展的历史，这就必须对生产力与生产关系及其相互关系作全面的研究。生产力与生产关系的论述，是“不能有所偏废的”。
