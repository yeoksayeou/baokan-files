An Admonition to Mr. Gaitskell: Attend to Your Own Domestic Affairs!
By Our Staff Commentator

British Labour Party leader Gaitskell has recently developed a sudden interest in the Taiwan issue. At a press conference on December 10, while advocating that the United Nations should recognize the People's Republic of China, he actually "suggested" that Taiwan be placed under United Nations "trusteeship" for a period, and then hold a "referendum" to determine the status of Taiwan. What does this mean? This can only be seen as Mr. Gaitskell repeating the clichés of those who attempt to create "two Chinas."

Taiwan is part of Chinese territory, and there is simply no question of "trusteeship" here. Gaitskell's "suggestion" actually denies the sacred sovereignty of the Chinese people over Taiwan and attempts to use the so-called "trusteeship" method to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, thereby creating a situation of "two Chinas." However, the Chinese people have long solemnly declared that any plan to create "two Chinas," whether it comes from the United States, Britain, or any other country, we firmly oppose.

Everyone knows that the current abnormal state of Taiwan is caused by the American military occupation. This should not be difficult for anyone with a little common sense to understand. The Chinese government and people have never recognized the illegal occupation of our territory Taiwan by the United States. We have always believed that American troops should withdraw from Taiwan; the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair and should be resolved by the Chinese people themselves. We Chinese people do not want to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and we firmly oppose anyone interfering in our internal affairs. We are determined to liberate Taiwan. If Mr. Gaitskell is a man of the times, he should know that he has no say in this matter. Similarly, if he is a man of the times, he should pay more attention to his own domestic affairs. Now the British public strongly opposes the United States turning Britain into its arsenal and missile base. What is Mr. Gaitskell's opinion on this issue? Some people in the British ruling group admit that the United States has the right to do so and are willing to give their national sovereignty to others. If Mr. Gaitskell holds the same view as those who betray the interests of the British people, he is, of course, free to do so. But if he also wants the Chinese people to cede their national sovereignty to the Americans like some people in the British ruling group, then that is too much and overestimating himself. We Chinese people and the people's government will never do this. We know how to safeguard our national territorial sovereignty. This is our own business. Here, we would like to advise Mr. Gaitskell, you should mind your own business and pay more attention to your own domestic affairs!

　　奉劝盖茨克尔先生：还是多管点自己家里的事吧！
　　本报评论员
    英国工党领袖盖茨克尔最近突然对台湾问题发生了兴趣。在12月10日的记者招待会上，他一边主张联合国应该承认中华人民共和国，一边竟“建议”把台湾交给联合国“托管”一个时期，然后举行“公民投票”来决定台湾的地位。这是什么意思呢？这只能认为盖茨克尔先生是在重复那些企图制造“两个中国”的陈词滥调。
    台湾是中国领土的一部分，这里根本不发生什么“托管”的问题。盖茨克尔的“建议”实际上是否认了中国人民对台湾的神圣主权，而企图利用所谓“托管”的办法，阻止中国人民解放台湾，从而造成“两个中国”的局面。可是，中国人民早就严正声明，任何关于制造“两个中国”的计划，不论是来自美国，还是来自英国或者任何其他国家，我们都坚决反对。
    谁都知道，台湾现在的不正常状态，是由于美国的军事占领而造成的。对于任何一个稍具常识的人来说，这一点应该是不难理解的。中国政府和人民从来也没有承认美国对我国领土台湾的非法占领。我们一直认为，美国军队应从台湾撤退；台湾问题是中国的内政，应由中国人民自己来解决。我们中国人民不想干涉别国的内政，也坚决反对任何人干涉我国的内政。我们是一定要解放台湾的。盖茨克尔先生如果是个识时务的人，该知道他在这个问题上是没有发言权的。同样的，如果他是个识时务的人，他倒应该多管点自己国内的事情。现在英国广大公众强烈反对美国把英国变为它的军火库和导弹基地，盖茨克尔先生对这个问题有什么意见呢？英国统治集团中的一些人承认美国有权这样做，并甘心情愿地把自己的国家主权让给别人。盖茨克尔先生如果也抱着同这些背叛英国人民利益的人一样的见解，当然有他的自由。可是他如果也想叫中国人民也像英国统治集团中某些人那样把自己国家的主权让给美国人，那就太过份了，太不自量了。我们中国人民和人民的政府永远不会这样做。我们是懂得应该怎样来维护自己国家的领土主权的。这是我们自己的事情。在这里，我们很想奉劝盖茨克尔先生，你还是少管别人的事，而多管点自己家里的事情吧！
