Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The failure of the United States to launch a satellite has become the subject of ridicule and satire in the commentaries of most newspapers around the world.

Some British newspapers specifically published cartoons and skits on the subject. "A blow to American prestige" and "a serious failure for the Americans" are the evaluations of most British newspapers regarding the failed US satellite launch.

Even some newspapers that usually speak for the United States believe that this failure is not only a scientific failure, but also a political one. The *News Chronicle*, under the headline "Failure Discourages America," published the news of the failed satellite launch.

		Washington Should Become More Humble

All Paris newspapers prominently published news of the failed US satellite launch with large headlines, and sharply pointed out in their commentaries the fact that the US is far behind the Soviet Union.

*Le Figaro* pointed out that "the Republican government has suffered a national and international failure" and that there was "too much pointless boasting" in the United States.

*L'Aurore* published an open letter from Robert Bonni to Dulles, asking the US government to learn from the failure of this satellite launch, to become more "humble" and to reconsider its policy towards its Western European allies. The letter stated, "For years you have insisted that only Americans can decide the fate of the world. You do not consider anyone, especially your allies. Your foreign policy has brought chaos to many regions, committed countless mistakes and suffered one failure after another." The letter went on to say that this American failure shows that "despite all the good conditions in the United States, it is not a country that is absolutely dominant in all aspects." Diplomats believe that the failed US satellite launch may have a "dark" impact on the upcoming NATO summit.

		Not Only Two to Zero, But Also Five Hundred to Zero

German newspapers published extensively on the failed US satellite launch and related commentary. *Neue Rhein Zeitung* wrote that the explosion of the US carrier rocket was "an event too serious to be ignored."

The Hamburg newspaper *Die Welt* wrote in an editorial that, from October 4th, the result of the space race was not only two to zero (two Russian satellites, and the US has none), but also five hundred to zero (the weight of the Russian satellite is five hundred kilograms, while the US has zero). The article went on to say that satellite technology is rocket technology. The Soviet Union possesses super rockets, therefore they have super satellites. The Americans have not yet possessed such rockets, so they cannot have their own satellites in space.

		The Main Reason for American Failure is Political

The Italian newspaper *L'Unità* emphasized in an article that this failure was not only due to technical reasons, but mainly due to serious political and social reasons. The victory of Soviet science and technology is the result of the socialist system, and not a purely "lucky," "temporary" and "accidental" achievement obtained through "a fortunate coincidence of various circumstances."

Geneva newspapers on the 7th also prominently reported with large headlines on the failed US satellite launch. *La Suisse* believes that this setback "is a serious failure for the United States."

Athens' morning and evening newspapers both published the news of the failed US satellite launch with large headlines. *I Vradyni* believes that the US government has suffered another major failure. The direct result of this failure will be an increase in the Soviet Union's prestige and reputation on the international stage and an increase in neutralist tendencies in other countries around the world. This is a devastating blow to the credibility of the United States around the world.

		Confidence in American Science Utterly Collapses

Danish newspapers emphasized in large headlines that "the US satellite launch suffered a horrific defeat." *Berlingske Tidende* wrote that the United States, which only a few months ago was confident of its dominance in world technology, has now been surpassed and left behind by Soviet rocket science. Therefore, the distance is not shrinking, but growing. The newspaper pointed out that this failure shattered all hopes of launching a satellite before the Paris meeting of the NATO Council. The psychological impact it has on the NATO heads of government meeting cannot be underestimated. Confidence in the scientific and technological conditions of the United States has completely collapsed.

Sweden's *Dagens Nyheter* wrote: "World news reporters invited by the Americans to watch the satellite launch instead became witnesses to this disastrous defeat. This defeat once again powerfully demonstrated that the Russians have a very great advantage."

		The United States is a Backward Country Compared to the Soviet Union

Japan's *Yomiuri Shimbun* published a commentary in its afternoon edition on the 7th stating that the failure of the US satellite launch proves that there is a huge gap between the US and the Soviet Union in terms of scientific strength. In this space age, the United States is a backward country compared to the Soviet Union.

*Yomiuri Shimbun* published a cartoon depicting an injured "Uncle Sam" limping away from a pile of smoking "Vanguard" rockets. The newspaper said that the failed US satellite launch was an "unprecedented disgrace" and a "Pearl Harbor of American science." At the same time, the American failure "makes the Soviet satellite launch even more meaningful and important."

*Tokyo Shimbun* commented on the failed US satellite launch: Since the end of World War II, the United States has acted like an emperor in every move it makes (including the recent action of forcing the mayor of Naha, Okinawa to resign), but in reality, its true scientific level is far inferior to that of the Soviet Union.

		American Self-boasting Ends in a Great Embarrassment

Egyptian newspapers on the 7th prominently published news of the failed US satellite launch with large headlines. Many newspapers also pointed out that this failure was a new blow to American prestige.

*Al-Masaa*'s editorial said, "The American satellite exploded, and the American scientific and technological reputation in the world exploded with it." It also said, "Compared to the Soviet Union in terms of intercontinental rockets and artificial moons, the imperialist West, led by the United States, is backward." The successful Soviet satellite launch proves that the Soviet social system has made it the world leader in scientific and technological progress in a short period.

The newspaper also believes that this American failure "will strengthen the position of active neutrality."

*Al-Ahram* also pointed out that this American failure was a "fatal" blow to American prestige. It also said that American boasting of its "superior propaganda, once again ended with a great embarrassment of its own making."

### 美国发射卫星失败成天下笑柄　各国舆论纷纷嘲讽美国落后和威信扫地

　　美国发射卫星失败成天下笑柄
　　各国舆论纷纷嘲讽美国落后和威信扫地
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国发射卫星失败成为世界各国大多数报刊在评论中嘲弄和讽刺的题材。
    某些英国报纸特地为此刊登了漫画和小品文。“对美国威信的打击”、“美国人的严重失败”是大多数英国报纸对美国这次发射人造地球卫星失败的估价。
    甚至一些平日替美国说话的报纸也认为这次失败不仅是科学性质的失败，也是政治性质的失败。“新闻纪事报”在“失败使美国灰心丧气”的大标题下刊登了发射人造卫星失败的消息。
      华盛顿应该变得谦逊些
    巴黎所有报纸都在显著地位以大字标题登载了美国发射人造地球卫星失败的消息，并且在评论中尖锐地指出了美国大大落后于苏联的事实。
    “费加罗报”指出，“共和党政府遭到了全国性的和国际性的失败”，在美国“无谓的叫嚣太多了”。
    “震旦报”发表了罗伯·博尼写给杜勒斯的一封公开信，要求美国政府从这次发射卫星的失败中吸取教训，变得“谦逊”些，并且重新考虑它对西欧盟国的政策。信中说，“多年来你们一直断言只有美国人才能决定世界的命运。你们不把任何人看在眼里，特别是你们的盟国。你们的外交政策给许多地区带来了混乱，犯了数不清的错误，遭到了接二连三的失败”。信中接着说，这次美国的失败说明，“尽管美国有种种良好条件，但是它并不是在各方面都居于绝对主导地位的国家”。外交人士认为，美国发射卫星失败可能对即将召开的北大西洋集团首脑会议产生“阴暗”影响。
  不仅是二比零，并且是五百比零
    西德各报大量刊载有关美国发射人造地球卫星失败的消息和评论。“新莱因报”写道，美国运载火箭的爆炸是“严重到不容忽视的事件”。
    汉堡“世界报”在社论中写道，从10月4日起，宇宙空间竞赛的结果，不仅是二比零（俄国两个卫星，美国连一个也没有），并且是五百比零（俄国卫星的重量是五百公斤，而美国是零）。文章接着写道，卫星技术就是火箭技术。苏联拥有超级火箭，因此他们有超级卫星。美国人迄今还不曾拥有这种火箭，因此他们也就不能在宇宙空间中有自己的卫星。
    美国的失败主要是政治原因
    意大利“团结报”在一篇文章中强调指出，这次失败不仅是由于技术上的原因，更主要的是由于严重的政治和社会原因。苏联科学技术的胜利是社会主义制度的结果，而不是什么由于“各种情况幸运的巧合”而获得的纯粹是“侥幸的”、“暂时的”和“偶然的”成就。
    日内瓦的报纸7日也在显著的地方以大字标题报道了关于美国发射人造卫星失败的消息。“瑞士报”认为这次失利“是美国的严重失败”。
    雅典的晨报和晚报都以大字标题刊登了美国发射人造地球卫星失败的消息。“新闻报”认为，美国政府又遭到了一次极大的失败。这一失败的直接结果将是苏联在国际舞台上威信和声望的增长和世界其他国家中立主义倾向的增长。这是对美国在全世界威信的毁灭性的打击。
    对美国科学的信心彻底崩溃
    丹麦各报在大字标题中强调指出，“美国发射卫星遭到了骇人听闻的惨败”。“贝林时报”写道，仅仅在几个月以前还自信在世界技术中占统治地位的美国，现在被苏联的火箭科学越过并抛在后边了。所以这个距离现在不是在缩短，而是在增长。报纸指出，这次失败打破了要在北大西洋公约组织理事会巴黎会议以前发射人造卫星的一切希望。它对北大西洋集团政府首脑会议所造成的心理影响是不可以轻视的。对美国的科学和技术条件的信心是彻底崩溃了。
    瑞典的“斯德哥尔摩新闻”写道：“应美国人邀请来观看卫星发射的世界新闻人士反而成了这次惨败的目睹者。这次惨败再一次特别有力地表明了俄国人具有非常大的优越性”。
    美国比起苏联是个落后国家
    日本“读卖新闻”在7日的下午版上发表评论说，美国发射人造卫星失败，证明美国和苏联在科学力量方面存在巨大的距离。在这个空间时代里，美国同苏联相比是一个落后的国家。
    “读卖新闻”刊载了一幅漫画，画着一个受伤的“山姆大叔”一瘸一拐地从一堆正在冒烟的“先锋”火箭的旁边走开。这家报纸说，美国发射人造卫星失败是“空前丢脸”的事，这是“美国科学上的珍珠港事件”。同时，美国的失败“使俄国发射卫星成功这件事更加意味深长和重要”。
    “东京新闻”就美国发射人造卫星失败这件事发表评论说：第二次世界大战结束以后，美国的一举一动（包括最近强使冲绳岛那霸市长去职的行动）俨如皇帝，但是实际上它真正的科学水平远远不如苏联。
  美国的自我吹嘘以大出丑而结束
    埃及各报7日都在显著地位用大标题发表了关于美国发射人造地球卫星失败的消息。许多报纸还指出，这次失败是对美国威信的新的打击。
    “晚报”的社论说，“美国的卫星爆炸了，美国在世界上的科学和技术声誉也跟着爆炸了。”它还说，“在洲际火箭和人造月亮方面同苏联比较，以美国为首的帝国主义西方是落后的。”苏联成功地发射人造卫星这件事证明，苏联的社会制度在短期内使它在科学和技术进展方面，成为世界第一了。
    这家报纸还认为，美国的这一失败“将加强积极中立政策的地位”。
    “金字塔报”也指出，美国这次失败是对美国威信的“致命”打击。它还说，美国吹嘘自己“优越的宣传，再一次以自己表演了一件大丑事而宣告结束”。
