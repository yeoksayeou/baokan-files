Xinhua News Agency report: According to TASS, the world's first 44,000-horsepower atomic icebreaker and some new 26,000-horsepower icebreakers will soon join the Soviet Arctic fleet. The world's longest Arctic route will become a major transportation artery for the Soviet Union to transport large quantities of national economic goods in the coming years. This was stated by Bukhanov, one of the leaders of the Soviet Northern Sea Route Administration, on the eve of the 25th anniversary (December 17) of the establishment of the administration.

Bukhanov said that the Soviet Arctic route is the shortest route connecting the European part of the Soviet Union and the Far East. Sailing along this route will shorten the journey by about one-half compared to sailing along the southern sea route. For example, the distance from Arkhangelsk to Vladivostok is 10,600 kilometers via the Arctic route, while sailing along the southern sea route through the Suez Canal requires a voyage of 24,400 kilometers.

Currently, the Soviet Union has hundreds of ships carrying hundreds of thousands of tons of goods along the Arctic route every year. In the past 25 years, Soviet transportation in the Arctic Ocean has increased approximately ninefold, while the cargo throughput of Arctic Ocean ports has increased fifteenfold.

Many new seaports have been opened along the Arctic coast. These places have now become industrial and cultural centers, and deposits such as diamonds, gold mines, and coal mines have also been discovered in these areas. Abundant timber resources have also been extensively developed.

Bukhanov also spoke about the scientific research work carried out by the Soviet Union in the Arctic. He said that the opening of the Arctic route is the result of years of systematic research conducted by Soviet scientists in the central Arctic. In recent years, the scale of this research has been particularly large. A series of high-latitude aircraft explorations were carried out, and seven drifting ice scientific stations and more than one hundred permanent polar scientific stations were established. In twenty-five years, Soviet polar scientists have conducted nearly four hundred scientific explorations. Many of these explorations have gained world renown. More than one hundred new geographical names have appeared on the map of the Soviet Arctic. At present, there is no area in the Soviet Arctic where scientists are not working.

    原子破冰船即将开始工作
    参加世界最长的北极航运
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社报道：世界上第一艘四万四千马力的原子破冰船和一些两万六千马力的新破冰船很快就要参加苏联北极船队中航行。世界上最长的北极航路，在最近几年内即将成为苏联输送大批国民经济货物的运输干线了。这是苏联北方海运管理局领导人之一布哈诺夫在这个管理局成立二十五周年（12月17日）前夕说的。
    布哈诺夫说，苏联在北极的航路，是把苏联欧洲部分和远东联接起来的最短路线。沿着这条线路航行，将比沿着南方海路航行要缩短二分之一左右的路程。例如从阿尔汉格尔前往海参崴，走北极航路时路程是一万零六百公里，而沿南方海路通过苏伊士运河前去，却要航行两万四千四百公里。
    目前，苏联每年有数百艘船只运载着数十万吨货物沿着北极航线航行。在过去的二十五年中，苏联在北冰洋的运输约增加了九倍，而北冰洋各港口的货物吞吐量则增加了十五倍。
    北冰洋沿岸开辟了许多新的海运港口。这些地方现在已经变成了工业和文化的中心，在这些地区还发现了金刚石、金矿和煤矿等矿藏。丰富的木材资源也得到了大量的开发。
    布哈诺夫还谈到了苏联在北极进行的科学研究工作。他说，北极航路的开拓，是苏联科学家多年来在北极中部进行系统研究的结果。近年来，这种研究的规模特别巨大。进行了一系列的飞机高纬度探测，并且建立了七个浮冰科学站和一百多个常设的极地科学站。在二十五年中，苏联的极地科学家们共进行了将近四百次的科学探测。其中很多次的探测获得了世界声誉。在苏联北极的地图上出现了一百多个新的地理名称。目前苏联的北极，没有一个地区没有科学家在工作。
