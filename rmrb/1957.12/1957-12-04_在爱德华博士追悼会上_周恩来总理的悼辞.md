Eulogy by Premier Zhou Enlai at Dr. Edward's Memorial Service

Your Excellency Ambassador Nehru, Comrades, Friends:

Our beloved friend of the Chinese people, Dr. Edward, has departed from us forever. We express our sorrow for him and extend our sincere condolences to his family in distant India.

As early as 1938, Dr. Edward forged a deep friendship with the Chinese people. At that time, the Chinese people were engaged in a difficult War of Resistance Against Japan. Dr. Edward led the Indian Medical Team to China to aid in the war effort, healing the wounded and rescuing the dying in the anti-Japanese base areas, selflessly serving the vast numbers of soldiers and civilians. Dr. Kotnis, a member of the medical team, even gave his precious life. The great Indian people and their outstanding son, Dr. Edward, provided such noble and valuable support to the Chinese people, which we will never forget. After the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, Dr. Edward was always very concerned about the development of New China in all aspects. This time, Dr. Edward, despite his fatigue, accepted the invitation of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association to visit China, fully demonstrating the friendship and love of the Indian people and himself for the Chinese people. Unfortunately, due to his old age and frailty, he ended his precious life in China. Although Dr. Edward has left us, he will forever live in the hearts of the Chinese people.

Dear friend Dr. Edward, rest in peace! The Chinese people will continue to make every effort to strengthen the great friendship between the people of China and India. This is the best memorial to Dr. Edward.

    在爱德华博士追悼会上
    周恩来总理的悼辞尼赫鲁大使阁下：同志们、朋友们：
    中国人民敬爱的朋友爱德华博士同我们永别了。我们怀着悲痛的心情对他表示悼念，并且向他远在印度的家属表示亲切的慰问。
    早在1938年，爱德华博士就同中国人民结成了深厚的友谊。当时，中国人民正在进行艰苦的抗日战争，爱德华博士率领了印度援华医疗队，在中国抗日根据地救死扶伤，忘我地为广大军民服务，医疗队队员柯棣华医生甚至献出了他宝贵的生命。伟大的印度人民和他们的优秀儿子爱德华博士对中国人民的这种崇高和珍贵的支援，是我们永远不会忘记的。中国人民革命胜利以后，爱德华博士一直十分关怀新中国在各方面的发展。这次，爱德华博士不辞劳累，应中印友好协会的邀请来中国访问，充分地表现了印度人民和他本人对中国人民的友好和热爱。但是，不幸因为他年老体衰在中国最后结束了他宝贵的生命。爱德华博士虽然离开了我们，但是，他将永远活在中国人民的心里。
    亲爱的朋友爱德华博士，安息吧！中国人民将会继续尽一切努力来加强中印两国人民之间的伟大友谊。这是我们对爱德华博士最好的纪念。（附图片）
