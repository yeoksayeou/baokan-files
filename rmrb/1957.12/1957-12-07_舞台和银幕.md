		Stage and Screen
		"A Gallery of Ugly Types" Presents a Hundred Ugly Faces
		Rightists Reveal Their True Colors
	The vigorous and momentous anti-Rightist struggle has given everyone a profound education. The "A Gallery of Ugly Types," written by Yang Huasheng and others, exposing the ugly faces of rightists, currently being performed by the Experimental Drama Theater of the Central Academy of Drama and the China Pingju Theater, brings an even more vivid and graphic education to the audience in the capital.
	The "A Gallery of Ugly Types" performed by the Experimental Drama Theater, through the director's meticulously designed and unique techniques, the actors' exaggerated yet realistic performances, and the concise, distinctive stage art and musical accompaniment, harmoniously forms a colorful, stylized satirical cartoon, leaving a fresh and unforgettable impression on the audience. It is a satirical comedy worth watching.
	The performance of "A Gallery of Ugly Types" by the China Pingju Theater allows Pingju-loving audiences to quickly see the faces of rightists through the dramatic form they are familiar with.
	"A Gallery of Ugly Types" was first performed in Shanghai in the form of a Shanghai opera; now, many drama troupes in various cities and some theatrical forms suitable for reflecting real life are also staging this play. (Shu)
		Subtle and Profound "Evidence"
	The Soviet film "Evidence" is adapted from the stage play of the same name by the writer Shirvato. The story takes place in Baku during the old Russian era: An oil magnate, in order to seize other people's property and achieve the goal of monopolizing all oil wells, shamelessly steals a piece of evidence held by his own daughter. This piece of evidence was obtained by his daughter from her lover. In order to pledge allegiance to her love, and to protest her father's shameless behavior, after the evidence is destroyed by her father, this girl also ends her life with a gun! The story structure is not complicated, but the description is subtle and moving. Through this film, we can clearly see the profit-seeking nature of the bourgeoisie, and how bourgeois family relationships are submerged in pure egoism and monetary relations. (Fang)
		Li Ersao on the Screen
	The film "Li Ersao Remarries," adapted from the novel of the same name by Wang Anyou and performed by the Shandong Lü Opera Troupe, is a good film. Its distinct local flavor and simple performances are what attract me the most. The story is familiar to everyone: a young widow, Li Ersao, lives a lonely life without joy; although she is busy from morning till night, she not only does not receive comfort or kind words from her mother-in-law "Fearless of Heaven," but also suffers from her刁难 (difficulties) and insults. She wants to marry the young farmer Zhang Xiaoliu, with whom she is in love, but not only does her mother-in-law obstruct and sabotage this, but she herself is also bound by old ideas, fearing "what people will say." After some twists and turns, Li Ersao finally marries Zhang Xiaoliu.
	The story takes place in the Shandong countryside. In the film, from the natural scenery, the layout of the courtyards and rooms, and other environmental atmospheres, to the characters' every word and action, all give people a real and intimate feeling. The actress Lang Xianfen, who plays Li Ersao, portrays Li Ersao's diligence, kindness, and complex emotions in difficult circumstances very well. Wang Junying's portrayal of Aunt Zhang makes people feel honest and amiable.
	What feels lacking is that some difficult-to-understand Shandong dialects have not been changed into Mandarin. (Zhang Rang)

　　舞台和银幕
　  “百丑图”里百丑出
    右派分子现原形
    轰轰烈烈的反右派斗争给了每一个人深刻的教育。中央戏剧学院实验话剧院和中国评剧院，正在上演杨华生等编剧、揭露右派分子丑恶面貌的“百丑图”，更带给首都观众生动的形象教育。
    实验话剧院演出的“百丑图”，经过导演精心设计的独特手法，演员夸张但又真实的表演，以及简洁、富有特色的舞台美术和音乐伴奏，合谐地组成一副多彩的、风格化的讽刺漫画，给观众留下了新鲜、难忘的印象。是一出值得一看的讽刺喜剧。
    中国评剧院“百丑图”的演出，使得爱好评剧的观众也能迅速地通过自己所熟悉的戏剧形式，看到右派分子的面貌。
    “百丑图”首先是在上海用滑稽剧形式演出的；现在，许多城市的话剧团体和某些适合反映现实生活的剧种也都在上演这出戏。　（树）
　　细腻、深刻的“证据”
    苏联影片“证据”是根据作家希尔瓦托的同名舞台剧改编摄制的。故事发生在旧俄时代的巴库：一个石油工业主，为了夺取别人的财产，以达到垄断所有油井的目的，竟无耻地去偷窃一份掌握在自己女儿手中的证据。这份证据是他的女儿从自己的爱人那儿得来的。为了誓忠于自己的爱情，为了抗议父亲的无耻行径，当证据被自己的父亲销毁了以后，这个女孩子也用枪结束了自己的生命！故事结构并不复杂，然而描叙却是细腻动人的。通过这部影片，我们可以清楚地看出资产阶级唯利是图的本性，以及资产阶级的家庭关系是如何被淹没在单纯的利己主义和金钱关系里。（方）
    银幕上的李二嫂
    根据王安友的同名小说改编、由山东吕剧团演出的电影“李二嫂改嫁”，是一部好影片。它的鲜明的地方色彩和朴实的表演，最吸引我。故事是大家熟悉的：一个年轻寡妇李二嫂，生活孤单，没有乐趣；虽然整天从早忙到晚，非但得不到婆婆“天不怕”的安慰和好言语，反而受到刁难和辱骂。她想和情投意合的青年农民张小六结婚，不但婆婆从中阻挠和破坏，而且自己也被旧思想束缚住，深怕“人言可畏”。经过一些风波，李二嫂终于和张小六结婚了。
    故事发生在山东农村。影片里，从自然景色、院落屋室的布置等环境气氛，到人物的一言一行，都给人以真实、亲切的感觉。扮演李二嫂的演员郎咸芬，把李二嫂的勤劳、善良，在艰难处境中的复杂心情演得很好。王俊英扮演的张大娘，让人觉得忠厚、可亲。
    感到不足的是：一些不易懂的山东土话没有改成普通话。　（张让）
