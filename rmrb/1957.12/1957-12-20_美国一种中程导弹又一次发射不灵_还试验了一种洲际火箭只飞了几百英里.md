Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 19th: Another U.S. medium-range missile test has suffered a setback. The Department of Defense announced on the 18th that it launched a "Jupiter" medium-range missile at the Cape Canaveral test site in Florida, but due to "technical difficulties," the missile did not complete its intended range.

The "Jupiter" medium-range missile is a 1,500-mile range missile manufactured by the Army, and it has had several failed tests in the past.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington: The U.S. Department of Defense announced that after two failed tests of the "Atlas" "intercontinental rocket," another test launch was conducted on the 17th at the Cape Canaveral test site in Florida. Minutes after the launch, the Department of Defense claimed that the rocket flew "several hundred miles" and landed in the "predetermined area." (Attached picture)

This is the moment when the American "Vanguard" rocket was launched on December 6th. The rocket exploded in a cloud of smoke and crashed to the ground only a few feet from its launch pad. This picture was originally published in the "New York Times," and the caption of the newspaper was "Failure."

    美国一种中程导弹又一次发射不灵
    还试验了一种洲际火箭只飞了几百英里
    新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：美国中程导弹试验又一次遭到挫折。国防部18日宣布，它在佛罗里达州卡纳维拉尔角试验场发射了一枚“丘辟特”式中程导弹，但是由于“技术困难”，这枚导弹并没有飞完预定的射程。
    “丘辟特”式中程导弹是陆军制造的射程一千五百英里的导弹，它以前也曾经有好几次试验失败。
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国国防部宣布，“阿特拉斯”式“洲际火箭”经过两次试验失败以后，17日又在佛罗里达州卡纳维拉尔角的试验场进行一次试验发射。在发射出去后几分钟，国防部宣称，火箭飞了“数百英里”，落在“预定地区”。（附图片）
    这是美国“先锋号”火箭在十二月六日发射时的一刹那的情景，火箭离开它的发射台不过几呎，就爆发一阵浓烟，坠地而毁。这幅图片原载“纽约时报”，该报的说明标题是“失败”。
