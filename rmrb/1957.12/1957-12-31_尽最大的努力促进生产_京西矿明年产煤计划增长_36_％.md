Strive to Promote Production

Jingxi Mine's Coal Production Plan to Increase by 36% Next Year

(Our newspaper dispatch) Reporter Ye Jianyun reports: Using a promoting spirit, considering the maximum limit of increased production, and making the greatest effort to deal with the 1958 production plan. This is the profound understanding gained by the Jingxi Mining Bureau recently when discussing and arranging next year's production tasks.

As with the situation encountered in previous years when formulating plans, the leadership of this mine did not have a clear understanding at the beginning of what kind of plan could be considered both active and reliable. The state assigned the mine a 1958 production target of 2.85 million tons of raw coal, which is 870,000 tons more than this year's planned output, and 500,000 tons more than this year's actual production. The party and administrative leaders of the Mining Bureau, taking into account the national coal supply situation, readily accepted this task. At the time, in their view, this target was neither conservative nor radical. Because compared with the actual production in 1957, it represents a growth of 21%. Arranging production at this rate, of course, cannot be said to be inactive. In terms of reliability, 1957 was a year in which the state plan was overfulfilled by 370,000 tons, and some mines even completed their annual production tasks two months ahead of schedule. Although the growth rate next year is large, the production potential is also not small, and it is still possible to complete the task.

In order to have a clear understanding of the situation, in early November, they organized some technical personnel and business management personnel to "investigate." They analyzed the actual production in 1957 and the geological data of various production sites for next year, and also learned about the preparations for next year's production. The result of the investigation further confirmed that the target of 2.85 million tons was reliable and active. When investigating and calculating, some people suggested that the output in 1958 might reach 3 million tons, and the Party Committee attached importance to this opinion. However, most people said that 2.85 million tons was already the maximum limit for increasing production. In order to make the plan stable and reliable, people did not focus on considering the figure of 3 million tons.

In mid-November, the Party Committee of the Mining Bureau decided to hand over the 1958 plan to the masses for discussion. At that time, the decision to launch mass discussions on the plan was based on the following needs: First, it is indeed a major event to increase coal production by 500,000 tons, and this major event cannot be accomplished without mobilizing the masses. Second, in the current production, there are still many key production problems that have not been solved, and we want to use this mass discussion of the plan as a mobilization to solve key production problems and launch a production upsurge. Although the slogan of increasing production to 3 million tons without increasing personnel was also put forward at that time, it was only regarded as a target figure to strive for.

The mass discussion has not yet ended today. More than 18,000 people participated in this discussion. The discussion shows that the output of the Jingxi Mining Bureau's mines in 1958 will not be 2.85 million tons, but 3 million tons, and it may even reach 3.2 million tons. Calculated based on the actual production in 1957, the growth rate reaches 36%. In the discussion, the broad masses of workers not only have an active and enthusiastic promoting spirit, but also seek truth from facts. For example, when the Fangshan Mine discussed the production target of the mine, the state assigned them a production task of 420,000 tons. After a preliminary estimate, they felt that this figure was conservative and took the initiative to change it to 500,000 tons. Later, Soviet experts came to the mine to help them conduct a detailed inspection and proposed that the annual output could reach 800,000 tons. The Deputy Chief Engineer of the Bureau was very surprised when he heard this number. However, the workers were calmly analyzing the various favorable and unfavorable factors in production. Everyone believes that the favorable conditions are that the workers have great enthusiasm after the rectification campaign; the unfavorable conditions are that the organization of labor is flawed, there is still a lack of some transportation equipment, and a transportation line must be built. These unfavorable factors can be completely overcome as long as the greatest efforts are made and the relevant leading departments provide appropriate assistance. The workers proposed that in addition to requesting the leadership to supply some coal trucks and put the newly built transportation line into production as soon as possible, all other difficulties can be solved by the mine itself. The workers said: An annual output of 800,000 tons is a bit difficult, but what production is not difficult!

When discussing the plan, the miners not only accounted for their own mine, but also for the country. The miners in the Qingshuijian mining area said that the key to increasing coal production and reducing production costs here is to add two more electric locomotives. Two locomotives require 60,000 yuan. After solving this problem, we can produce 30,000 to 50,000 tons more coal, and the cost of each ton of coal can be reduced by one yuan. The money saved from increasing production and reducing costs will be hundreds of thousands of yuan.

In this situation, the Party Committee of the Mining Bureau held several consecutive meetings. The meeting unanimously agreed that in dealing with the state's 1958 planned output target, it was not enough to implement the promoting spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical results. In the future, enterprises must fully implement the promoting spirit, and must correctly treat the masses' demands for increased production. To achieve this, on the premise of paying attention to safe production, the enterprise’s favorable and unfavorable factors should be fully analyzed. Comrade Wang Qiufang, Secretary of the Party Committee, also believes that since the rectification campaign, enterprises need to take big strides forward, and there is currently a full possibility of this. The great enthusiasm shown by the masses in discussing the state plan is a spur to our failure to dare to take bold steps. The Party Committee proposed to the cadres of each group: Use the spirit of promotion, consider the maximum increase in production, and make the greatest efforts to build next year's plan on a basis that is both advanced and reliable.

Many facts that have emerged in various mines have proved that the call made by the Party Committee of the Mining Bureau is correct. Due to rain leakage in each mining area of the Mentougou Mine, the production task has been very small. This year's planned output is only 285,000 tons, and the state needs to subsidize 500,000 yuan in terms of cost. The 1958 plan is to increase it to 490,000 tons. In order to achieve this goal, they have taken the following measures: The annual rainfall in the Mentougou area is 800 mm, and the maximum rainfall is 1200 mm, and the rainy season is concentrated in June and August. In order to overcome natural difficulties, they first decided to do a good job in waterproofing as soon as possible. In January and February next year, they will start to work on Zhashan Gully, blocking surface loopholes, and tidying up drainage channels. Secondly, 90% of the annual output task is concentrated on production before and after the rainy season. In this way, even if the waterproofing project fails, it will not affect the annual output. Thirdly, adjust the order of layered coal mining, mining low-layer coal before the rainy season, and mining high-layer coal during the rainy season. In this way, not only can the increased production plan be guaranteed, but also subsidies can be avoided and profits can be earned to be handed over to the state. This method of arranging production according to natural conditions and production laws is being widely adopted by various mines in Jingxi.

The national plan production target for the Jingxi Mining Bureau next year is set at 3 million tons, and the increased production and cost saving target is set at 3.2 million tons. In the mass discussion, after investigation and calculation by the workers, it was believed that it was also possible to reach 3.7 million tons. Whether the above indicators can continue to rise has not yet been concluded. However, a mood of moving forward with big strides fully shows that they are treating the state plan for 1958 with an active spirit.

### 尽最大的努力促进生产  京西矿明年产煤计划增长36％

    尽最大的努力促进生产
    京西矿明年产煤计划增长36％
    本报讯　记者叶剑韵报道：用促进的精神，考虑增产的最大限度，尽最大的努力，来对待1958年的生产计划。这是京西矿务局最近在讨论安排明年生产任务的时候获得的深切体会。
    像历年订计划所碰到的情况一样，这个矿的领导上对制定一个什么样的计划才算积极可靠，一开始认识并不是那么清楚的。国家下达给这个矿的1958年产量指标是年产二百八十五万吨原煤，比今年的计划产量多八十七万吨，比今年的生产实绩多五十万吨；矿务局党和行政的领导人员考虑到全国煤炭供应情况，很干脆地接受了这个任务。当时，在他们看来，这个指标是既不保守又不冒进的。因为和1957年的生产实绩相比较，增长了21％。用这样的速度安排生产，当然不能说是不积极。在可靠性方面，1957年是超额三十七万吨完成国家计划的一年，有些矿还提前两个月完成了全年生产任务。明年增长率虽大，生产潜力也不小，完成任务还是有把握的。
    为了做到心中有数，11月初，他们就组织了部分技术人员和企业管理人员去“摸底”。分析今年的生产实绩和明年各个生产场地的地质资料，又了解了明年生产的各项准备工作。摸底的结果，进一步证实了二百八十五万吨的指标是可靠的，也是积极的。在摸底算账的时候，有人曾提出1958年的产量有可能达到三百万吨，党委会重视了这个意见；但是多数人的说法是：二百八十五万吨已经是增产的最大限度了。为了使计划稳妥可靠，人们没有着重去考虑三百万吨这个数字。
    11月中旬，矿务局党委会决定把1958年的计划交给群众讨论。当时考虑发动群众讨论计划是由下列需要决定的：第一、要增加五十万吨煤，确是一件大事，不发动群众，就办不了这件大事；第二、在目前的生产当中，还有不少生产关键没有解决，想把这一次群众性的讨论计划作为解决生产关键，掀起生产高潮的一次动员。当时虽然也提出了要求在增产不增人的情况下，把产量提高到三百万吨的口号；但仅把它看作是一个争取数字。
    群众讨论到今天还没有结束。参加这次讨论的有一万八千多人。讨论的情况表明，京西矿务局所属各矿1958年的产量，不是二百八十五万吨，而是三百万吨，还有可能达到三百二十万吨。按1957年生产实绩计算，增长率达到36％。在讨论当中，广大职工不仅有一股积极热情的促进精神，而且也是实事求是的。如房山矿在讨论本矿产量指标时，国家分配给他们的生产任务是四十二万吨，他们初步一估算，觉得这个数字保守了，即主动改为五十万吨。后来苏联专家到矿上来帮他们做了一次详细的检查，提出了年产量可以达到八十万吨的意见。局里的副总工程师听到这个数字很惊讶。但是职工们却在冷静地分析生产上的各种有利因素和不利因素。大家认为，有利条件是经过整风，职工干劲很大；不利的条件是劳动力的组织有缺点，还缺少一部分运输工具，还要搞好一条运输线路。而这些不利因素，只要尽最大的努力，有关领导部门作适当的帮助，是完全可以克服的。职工们提出除了要求领导上供应部分运煤车和新建的运输线路提早投入生产以外，其他一切困难都可以由本矿自行解决。职工们说：年产八十万吨是有些吃力，但是，生产哪有不吃力的事呢！
    矿工们在讨论计划的时候，不仅为本矿算了账，而且也替国家算了账。清水涧采区的矿工们说，我们这里多出煤、降低生产成本的关键是再增加两台电机车。两台机车需要六万元，解决了这个问题以后，我们就可以多出三万到五万吨煤，每吨煤的成本可以降低一元，增产节约下来的钱，就有几十万元。
    在这样的情况下，矿务局党委会连续开了好几次会议。会上一致认为：在对待1958年国家计划的产量指标方面，贯彻多快好省的促进精神是不够的。今后企业要全面贯彻促进的精神，就必须正确对待群众的增产要求。要做到这一点，在注意安全生产的前提下，应当充分地分析企业的有利因素和不利因素。党委书记王秋芳同志也认为：整风以来，企业需要跨大步子向前跃进，目前也完全有这种可能；群众讨论国家计划所表现出来的巨大热情，就是对我们不敢大胆迈步的一种鞭策。党委向各组干部提出：要用促进的精神，考虑最大限度地增产，要尽最大的努力，使明年的计划建筑在既先进又可靠的基础上。
    目前各矿出现的许多事实证明，矿务局党委会提出的这个号召是正确的。门头沟矿各采区由于雨季漏水，产量任务一直很小，今年的计划产量只有二十八万五千吨，成本方面要国家贴补五十万元。而1958年的计划要提高到四十九万吨。为了实现这个目标，他们采取了下列措施：门头沟地区的常年雨量是八百公厘，最大的雨量是一千二百公厘，而雨季是集中在6、8两个月。为了克服自然困难，他们首先决定及早做好防水工程。明年1、2月份就开始动手闸山沟，堵表层的漏洞，整理排水渠道。其次，把全年90％的产量任务集中在雨季前后生产，这样万一防水工程失效，也不致影响全年的产量。再次，调整分层采煤的秩序，雨季前采低层煤，雨季采高层煤。这样，不仅可以保证完成增产计划，而且可以不要补贴，争取有利润上交给国家，这种根据自然条件和生产规律安排生产的作法，京西各矿正在普遍采用。
    京西矿务局明年的国家计划生产指标确定为三百万吨，增产节约指标定为三百二十万吨。在群众讨论中，职工们经过摸底算账，认为也有可能达到三百七十万吨。上述指标能否继续上升，至今还没有结论。不过一股大踏步向前迈进的情绪，充分说明了他们是在用积极的精神对待1958年的国家计划的。
