    The long-awaited "Draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme" has been published, which is a historically significant event in our people's cultural life. It will have a profound impact on the future development of culture and science in our country. When my comrades and I saw this draft in the trenches on the Korean front, we were all overjoyed and told each other the news.
    I was illiterate before the age of thirteen. Although I attended school for three years while working part-time, after a year of apprenticeship, I was still semi-literate. After joining the revolution, I continued my cultural studies, but at that time, we were in the tense stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and we were constantly fighting, so it was not easy to learn well. In 1945, I accidentally bought a small dictionary with Latin phonetic alphabet annotations in a market town. I learned the pronunciation of the Latin phonetic alphabet from the small dictionary. From then on, I mastered the pinyin tool and regarded it as a treasure. In just a few months, I learned more than two thousand characters, far more than the total I had learned in the previous few years. The Latin pinyin tool thus quickly helped me escape illiteracy. In the following twelve years, this tool continued to serve me well, and besides continuing to help me recognize characters, it also brought me many benefits in daily study, work, and life.
    I used to work as a code translator. Telegrams are very time-sensitive, but because Chinese characters have too many characters and strokes, they cannot be directly transmitted using telegraphic symbols. They must be translated using Arabic numerals or Latin letters as intermediaries before they can be sent. Now that we have the Chinese pinyin alphabet, we can use pinyin letters as abbreviation symbols.
    I used the Latin pinyin alphabet to study Russian on my own on the Korean front. Because I basically mastered the common knowledge of pinyin, I did not take detours in pronunciation and grammar. The pinyin tool also helped us enrich our knowledge. In the past, during a battle, the soldiers captured several bottles of medicine, all labeled in Latin. Although I had not studied it, I still used the pinyin methods I had learned to spell out the sounds of "penicillin."
    I am from Jiangsu, and I speak with a heavy local accent. The comrades I worked with could not understand me. Later, I used the pinyin alphabet to correct my pronunciation. Soon, I mastered the correspondence between dialect and Mandarin, and I could correct my pronunciation by analogy. Now, no one can misunderstand me when I speak.
    It is difficult to write down all the benefits that have come since I learned the pinyin alphabet. I think from the fragmentary introduction above, it can already be seen that the pinyin alphabet is a very important tool, and learning it will bring us many conveniences. Therefore, not only those who are currently studying culture need it, but also intellectuals who have already mastered the written language cannot be without it. It can also be said that the pinyin alphabet is the tool of tools. As the ancient saying goes, "If a craftsman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." This saying is very true.
    I wholeheartedly support this draft and hope that it will quickly blossom among the masses and bring more benefits to the socialist construction of the motherland. Below are two limericks I have written using the Chinese pinyin alphabet I just learned:
    拼音方案公布了，　Pinyin fang’an gongbuliao，
    工农战士齐欢笑。　Gongnong zhanshi qi huanxiao。
    赶快掌握新武器，　Gankuai zhang’o xin－wuqi，
    攻占文化大碉堡。　Gongzhan wenhua da－diaobao。
    The pinyin scheme is announced,
    Workers, peasants and soldiers laugh together.
    Quickly master the new weapon,
    To capture the great cultural bunker.
    拼音工具效力高，　Pinyin gongju xiaoli gao，
    扫盲识字它是宝，　Saomang shizi ta shi bao，
    学习外文它是桥，　Xuexi wai－wen ta shi qiao，
    你如不信试试瞧。　Ni ru bu xin shi shi qiao。
    The pinyin tool is highly effective,
    It is a treasure for eliminating illiteracy,
    It is a bridge for learning foreign languages,
    If you don't believe it, try it and see.

### 拼音工具给我带来的好处

    拼音工具给我带来的好处
    中国人民志愿军  管谦
    久已渴望的“汉语拼音方案草案”公布了，这是我国人民文化生活中具有历史意义的一件大事。它将对我国今后文化、科学的发展发生深远的影响。当我和我的战友们在朝鲜前线的山沟里看到这个草案的时候，大家都喜出望外地相互奔告。
    我在十三岁以前是个文盲，以后虽然半耕半读上了三年学，但经过一年的学徒生活以后，仍然是个半文盲。参加革命以后，又进行文化学习，可是当时处在抗日战争的紧张阶段，经常战斗，也不容易学好。1945年在一个集镇上我偶然买到一本用拉丁拼音字母注音的小字典，我在小字典上学会了拉丁拼音字母的发音。从此以后，我就掌握了拼音工具，把它当作怀中之宝。不几个月，我就学会了两千多个字，远远超过我以前几年所学的总和。拉丁拼音工具就是这样迅速地使我摆脱了文盲状态。在以后的十二年中，这个工具还经常为我服务，除了继续帮我识字以外，在日常学习、工作和生活等方面也给我带来了很多好处。
    我曾经做过译电工作。电报是非常讲究时间性的，但由于汉字数量和笔划太多太繁，不能用电讯符号直拍，必须用阿拉伯数字或拉丁字母作媒介，经过翻译才能拍发。现在我们有了汉语拼音字母，就可以应用拼音字母作为省略符号。
    我在朝鲜前线利用拉丁拼音字母自修俄文，由于我基本上掌握了拼音常识，在发音和学习文法中没有走弯路。拼音工具还帮助我们丰富知识。过去在一次战役中，战士们缴获了几瓶药品，上面都是拉丁文，我虽没有学过，但运用自己学过的拼音方法，同样也拼出了“配尼西林”几个音。
    我是江苏人，讲话乡土音很重，和我在一块工作的同志都听不懂我的话。后来我就利用拼音字母纠正自己的读音，不久我就掌握了方言和普通话的对应关系，就能举一反三地改正读音。现在我说话，再没有人听不懂了。
    要把我学会拼音字母后带来的好处一下子都写出来是有困难的。我想从上面零碎的介绍中，已经可以看出拼音字母是个很重要的工具，学会以后，会给我们带来许多方便。因此，不仅正在学习文化的人需要它，就是已经掌握文字工具的知识分子也不能缺少它。也可以这样说，拼音字母是工具中的工具，古语说：“工欲善其事，必先利其器”。这话说得很对。
    我衷心拥护这个草案，并希望它很快地在群众中开花，为祖国社会主义建设带来更多的好处。下面是我用刚学过的汉语拼音字母来拼写的两首打油诗：
    拼音方案公布了，　Pinyin fang’an gongbuliao，
    工农战士齐欢笑。　Gongnong zhanshi qi huanxiao。
    赶快掌握新武器，　Gankuai zhang’o xin－wuqi，
    攻占文化大碉堡。　Gongzhan wenhua da－diaobao。
    拼音工具效力高，　Pinyin gongju xiaoli gao，
    扫盲识字它是宝，　Saomang shizi ta shi bao，
    学习外文它是桥，　Xuexi wai－wen ta shi qiao，
    你如不信试试瞧。　Ni ru bu xin shi shi qiao。
