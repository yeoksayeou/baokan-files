Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Liang reports: During the rectification and improvement stage of the Great Blooming and Great Contending, staff members of the central industrial departments have made strict and sharp criticisms of many wasteful phenomena in construction that violate the principle of diligence and thrift in building the country. Many examples in the mass criticism profoundly illustrate that many wasteful phenomena are largely caused by bureaucracy and subjectivism. Therefore, it is of great significance for the central industrial departments, which bear the enormous responsibility of national industrial construction, to strive to overcome bureaucracy and subjectivism in their work for national construction.

Planning is the basis of construction work. However, due to insufficient consideration beforehand and repeated changes afterward, many wasteful incidents have occurred. Big-character posters from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry criticized the situation where the expansion project of Daye Steel Plant has been underway for four years but has not yet been completed. This project has suffered significant losses due to multiple changes in the plan and revisions to the general layout. Waste on railways, docks, etc., alone amounted to more than 3 million yuan. The Paper Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry, with the approval of the ministry, decided to expand the bleaching workshop of the Guangzhou Paper Mill. At that time, the designers believed that this was not cost-effective and repeatedly raised their opinions to the Paper Industry Administration Bureau, but they were not adopted. Last year, the project was completed, but the Paper Industry Administration Bureau suddenly decided not to bleach the paper. Therefore, this expansion workshop has not been put into production to this day. It not only wasted the efforts of the designers but also tied up more than 600,000 yuan of construction funds. In 1954, the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications decided to move a highway cadre school in Jiangmen City, Guangdong Province, to Wuhan City and allocated 400,000 to 500,000 yuan to buy houses and furniture in Wuhan. However, only two months after the school moved to Wuhan, the Highway Bureau decided to merge it with a highway cadre school in Chongqing, leaving a branch school in Wuhan. As a result, much waste was created in terms of housing and furniture.

Many big-character posters also exposed and criticized many subjective problems in design work. Some designers at the Paper Design Institute of the Ministry of Light Industry, in the design of a paper mill project, had no design basis at all. Relying only on a photograph of an American beater, they decided to adopt this equipment and carry out the design. After the design was completed, it was not tested or experimented with, and orders were placed in large quantities from abroad based on their own design drawings. It has now been found that the beater manufactured domestically using this design drawing is completely unusable; and the batch of orders from abroad has already started manufacturing and cannot be salvaged.

In terms of construction, cases of waste caused by proceeding solely from subjective wishes, without considering objective conditions, needs, and possibilities, can be found in all industrial departments. Big-character posters from the Second Ministry of Machine Building criticized the ministry for lacking a comprehensive analysis of the objective possibilities at the time when formulating the construction plan for the first quarter of 1956 (such as the design drawings for some major projects not yet being available). The targets were set too high, and different requirements were not put forward for different regions. As a result, individual regions had to build more welfare projects such as dormitories and guest houses in order to complete the plan. As a result, when the design drawings for the main projects came out in the second quarter, the supply of building materials could not keep up, resulting in a large amount of idle work. The ministry's plan to complete 18% of the investment target in the first quarter only achieved 13.76%.

Big-character posters from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry criticized the following event: The ministry planned to build a prestressed concrete pipe factory for the construction project of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex to manufacture concrete pipes to replace some of the cast iron pipes and steel pipes, which could save 90% of the steel materials. Before the factory construction plan had been formally approved in writing, the person in charge of the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry who went to the local area to understand the situation agreed to start construction. Later, the State Construction Commission, considering that there was already a concrete pipe factory in Hanyang, asked the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry to quickly submit an economic comparison plan for building the factory. However, before the plan was finalized, the Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation, affiliated to the Construction Bureau, transported the large quantities of building materials that had been shipped to the site out again, refilled the excavated earthwork, and transferred away the technical personnel who had been gathered from various units. Finally, after studying the economic comparison plan for building the factory, the Construction Commission approved the establishment of the new factory. As a result, the construction department reorganized and not only spent more money but also delayed the factory construction time by three and a half months.

Due to bureaucracy and subjectivism, the unrealistic nature and excessively high standards of waste caused in the construction of schools, the development of scientific research, and other non-productive construction have also been severely criticized by the masses. The Ministry of Food Industry bought a large car and a very beautiful small car for a secondary technical school in Nanjing. Because it was too conspicuous to drive out, it had to be parked in the warehouse. The internal equipment and furniture of many scientific research departments are overly elaborate. For example, the furniture used by the Beijing Petroleum Refining Research Institute of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry is made of precious wood from the Xiaoxing'an Mountains in Northeast China—ash wood. The research and experiment personnel sit on very beautiful leather-covered swivel chairs with springs. The steel rulers used for measurement by the Paper Design Institute of the Ministry of Light Industry could have been domestic steel rulers worth about 200 yuan, but they ordered high-grade invar baseline rulers worth 10,000 yuan from West Germany. A big-character poster from the Ministry of Construction Engineering criticized a hospital built by the Central and Southern Construction Engineering Administration Bureau, affiliated with the ministry, in Wuhan for being too large and having too good equipment. This hospital has 300 beds, but the utilization rate is only 30%. A nursery established by the bureau last year with an investment of tens of thousands of yuan is too high-end and too expensive. In addition to charging each child 25 yuan, the public has to subsidize each child about 20 yuan to cover the expenses.

Some of the reasons for the occurrence of the above-mentioned wasteful phenomena cannot, of course, all be attributed to bureaucracy and subjectivism. In the past, there was a lack of experience, and some waste was unavoidable. In order to gain construction experience, a certain price must be paid. However, big-character posters from many departments point out that if our staff, especially leading cadres, can delve into their work, start from the overall situation, from the principle of diligence and thrift in building the country, and conduct thorough investigations and studies in combination with the conditions of various aspects when determining the plan, scale, equipment, etc., for each project, much waste can be reduced or avoided.

The heads of the central industrial departments welcome and accept these positive and strict criticisms from the masses. Many departments have established special groups to conduct in-depth inspections of the various causes of waste in construction work, based on the Party Central Committee's principle of building the country with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and adopting the method of combining leadership and the masses, with great blooming, great contending, great rectification, and great improvement, in order to find ways to effectively overcome bureaucracy and subjectivism in construction work. The Ministry of Electric Power Industry has listed the issue of how to implement the principle of diligence and thrift in building the country as a "big watermelon" in the rectification and improvement process. During the upsurge of the Great Blooming and Great Contending, the Infrastructure Construction Bureau, affiliated with the ministry, adopted a suggestion from a big-character poster and immediately reviewed the overseas ordering plan for all construction machinery for next year within four days, preventing stockpiling and saving the country 1.1 million yuan.

### 中央各工业部门大字报发挥威力  火烧建设事业中的大浪费

    中央各工业部门大字报发挥威力
    火烧建设事业中的大浪费
    本报特约稿　新华社记者王良报道：在整改阶段的大鸣大放中，中央各个工业部门的工作人员，对建设工作中许多违背勤俭建国方针的浪费现象，提出了严格的尖锐的批评。群众批评的许多事例深刻地说明，有许多浪费现象在很大程度上是由于官僚主义和主观主义造成的。因此，担负着国家工业建设巨大责任的中央各个工业部门，努力克服工作上的官僚主义和主观主义，对国家建设有十分重大的意义。
    计划工作是建设工作的依据。但是由于事先考虑不周，事后屡次变动，造成了不少的浪费事例。冶金工业部的大字报批评大冶钢厂扩建工程已经进行四年尚未完工的情况。这个工程因方案多次变动，总布置图改来改去，损失很大。仅铁路、码头等等的浪费就有三百多万元。轻工业部造纸工业管理局，经过这个部的批准，决定扩建广州造纸厂的漂白车间。当时，设计人员认为这样做不合算，一再向造纸局提出意见，但是没有被采纳。去年，这项工程竣工了，可是，造纸局忽然又决定纸张不漂白了。因此，这个扩建车间至今没有投入生产。它不仅白白浪费了设计人员的心血，还积压了建设资金六十多万元。交通部公路总局在1954年决定把广东省江门市的一个公路干部学校迁到武汉市，拨出了四、五十万元在武汉买了房子和家具。但是在这个学校迁到武汉以后仅仅两个月，公路总局又决定它和重庆一个公路干部学校合并，在武汉留下一个分校。结果，在房子和家具方面，造成了许多浪费。
    许多大字报还揭露和批判了在设计工作中的许多主观主义毛病。轻工业部造纸设计院某些设计人员，在一项造纸厂工程的设计中，根本没有任何设计依据，只凭美国打浆机的照片，就决定采用这种设备并进行设计；设计好以后，又没有经过试制和试验，就根据自己设计的图纸向国外大批定货。现在发现，国内采用这个设计图制造出来的打浆机，根本不能用；而在国外的那批定货，已经开始制造，无法挽救了。
    在施工方面，只从主观愿望出发，不考虑客观条件，不考虑需要和可能因而造成浪费的事例，在各个工业部门都可以找到。第二机械工业部的大字报批评这个部在制定1956年第一季度的施工计划时，对当时客观的可能性缺乏全面的分析（如有些主要工程项目设计图纸还没有出来），指标订得过高，同时对不同地区也没有提出不同的要求。因而个别地区为了完成计划，只好多建宿舍、招待所等福利项目。结果到第二季度当主要工程项目的设计图纸出来后，建筑材料供应不上，造成大量窝工。这个部要求第一季度完成投资指标18％的计划，执行结果仅达到13.76％。
    冶金工业部的大字报批评这样一件事：这个部计划为武汉钢铁联合企业的建设工程建设一座预应力混凝土制管厂，制造混凝土管，以代替一部分铸铁管、钢管，这样可以节约90％的钢铁材料。在这个厂的建厂方案还未经书面审批前，到当地了解情况的冶金部建筑局负责人就同意开工，后来国家建设委员会考虑到在汉阳已经有一个混凝土制管厂，要冶金部迅速提出建厂的经济比较方案。但是在方案未定以前，建筑局所属的武汉冶金建筑总公司就把已经运到现场的大批建筑材料外运，把已经开挖的土方重新填回去，并调走了从各单位集中来的技术人员。最后，经过对建厂经济比较方案的研究，建委批准建立这个新厂。结果，施工部门重整旗鼓，不仅多花了钱，而且使建厂时间拖后了三个半月。
    由于官僚主义和主观主义，在建设学校、发展科学研究事业以及其他非生产性建设方面，造成的不切合实际、标准过高等等的浪费，也受到了群众的严厉批评。食品工业部在南京一个中等技术学校已经买了一辆大汽车，又买了一辆很漂亮的小汽车，因为坐出去太显眼，只好停放在仓库里。许多科学研究部门的内部设备、家具等等过分讲究。如石油工业部北京石油炼制研究所用的家具是用东北小兴安岭名贵的木料——水曲柳做成的，研究试验人员坐的是很漂亮的用皮做的弹簧转椅。轻工业部造纸设计院测量用的钢尺，只要价值二百元左右的国内造的钢尺就可以了，但却向西德定购了价值达万元的高级的铟钢基线尺。建筑工程部一张大字报批评这个部所属的中南建筑工程管理局在武汉建设的一个医院，规模过大，设备过好。这个医院拥有三百张床位，但是利用率仅30％。这个局去年投资几万元建立的一个托儿所，因为设备太高级，费用太大，除了要向每个托儿收费二十五元以外，公家对每个儿童还要补贴二十元左右才够开支。
    发生上面这些浪费现象的原因，有一些当然还不能够把账全都记在官僚主义和主观主义上面。过去没有经验，有些浪费是不可避免的，为了取得建设的经验，还必须付出一定的代价。但是，许多部门的大字报都指出：如果我们的工作人员，特别是领导干部，能够深入钻研业务，在确定每一项工程的方案、规模、设备等等的时候，都从整体出发，从勤俭建国的方针出发，并结合各个方面的条件好好地进行调查研究，有许多浪费是可以减少或避免的。
    中央各个工业部门的负责人，欢迎和接受群众这些积极的严格的批评。许多部门都成立了专门的小组，根据党中央提出的多快好省的勤俭建国的方针，采取领导与群众相结合的大鸣大放大整大改的方法，对建设工作上造成浪费的各种原因进行了深入的检查，以便找出办法，有效地克服建设工作中的官僚主义和主观主义。电力工业部把如何执行勤俭建国方针这个问题列为整改中的一个“大西瓜”。这个部所属的基建总局在大鸣大放高潮中，采纳了一张大字报上的建议，立即在四天之内审查了明年全部施工机械的国外订货计划，防止了积压，为国家节约了一百一十万元。
