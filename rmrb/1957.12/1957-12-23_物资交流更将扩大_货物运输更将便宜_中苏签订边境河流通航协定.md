    Material Exchange to Expand Further, Cargo Transportation to Become Cheaper
    China and the Soviet Union Sign Border River Navigation Agreement
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 22nd: On December 21st in Moscow, representatives of the Chinese and Soviet governments signed an agreement regarding merchant ship navigation on the border rivers and lakes connected to the border between China and the Soviet Union.
    The navigable distance on the border rivers and lakes connected to the border between China and the Soviet Union stretches for thousands of kilometers. Material exchange between China and the Soviet Union (especially between Northeast China and the Soviet Far East, as well as between Xinjiang China and the Kazakh Republic of the Soviet Union) still relies on water transportation. Therefore, the Chinese and Soviet governments, based on the principle of equality, unanimously agreed that merchant ships of both sides can freely navigate on the Heilongjiang River, the Songhua River, the Kara-Irtysh River, and Lake Xingkai, and that measures will be taken to ensure that the shipping enterprises of both countries can participate satisfactorily in such transportation.
    The signing of this agreement is a manifestation of the further development of friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. It foreshadows that material exchange between China and the Soviet Union will be further expanded and that cargo transportation will become cheaper and more rational. This will greatly benefit the people of both countries.
    The negotiations were conducted in an atmosphere of friendship and mutual understanding. Zhu Lizhi, Plenipotentiary Representative of the State Council of China and Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications, and Shashkov, Plenipotentiary Representative of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and Minister of River Transport of the Russian Federation, signed the agreement. The agreement will take effect upon ratification by both parties.

    中苏签订边境河流通航协定
    新华社莫斯科22日电  中国和苏联两国政府代表12月21日在莫斯科签订了关于中苏两国边境上以及与边境相通的河流和湖泊商船通航的协定。

    这项协定的签订是中苏两国友好合作进一步发展的表现，它预示着中苏两国的物资交流将更加扩大，货物运输将更便宜和合理。这对两国人民都有很大好处。
    这次谈判是在友好和互相谅解的气氛下进行的。在协定上签字的有中国国务院全权代表、交通部副部长朱理治，苏联部长会议全权代表、俄罗斯联邦河运部部长夏什科夫。协定将在双方批准后生效。
