Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 16th: The 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly closed on the 14th.

　　At the plenary closing meeting, the representatives reviewed the recommendations of the Political Committee on the question of peaceful coexistence among nations and unanimously adopted the resolution by a vote of seventy-seven to zero.

　　The full text of the adopted resolution is as follows:

　　"The General Assembly,

　　Considering the urgency and importance of consolidating international peace and developing peaceful neighborly relations among all countries, regardless of their differences or the stage and nature of their political, economic and social development,

　　Recalling that the fundamental objectives of the Charter include maintaining world peace and security and friendly cooperation among nations,

　　Recognizing the need to promote these objectives and develop peaceful and tolerant attitudes among nations based on mutual respect, mutual benefit, non-aggression, mutual respect for sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity, and non-interference in internal affairs, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, and to achieve the purposes and principles of the Charter.

　　Affirms the need to expand international cooperation, ease tensions, and resolve differences and disputes between countries through peaceful means.

　　Requests all countries to make every effort to consolidate international peace, develop friendly cooperative relations, and resolve disputes in accordance with the peaceful methods prescribed in the Charter and set forth in this resolution."

　　Kuznetsov, head of the Soviet delegation, spoke at the closing meeting and evaluated the work of the 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly.

　　He said that although the session had not fully completed its tasks, it was necessary to point out some of its positive aspects.

　　First, the General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution on such an important issue as peaceful coexistence among nations. The General Assembly's discussion of the threat of military aggression against Syria was undoubtedly of positive significance. This discussion was an important factor in preventing a military offensive against the Syrian people, thereby making an important contribution to maintaining peace in the Middle East and the world. However, it is regrettable that the session did not make any practical resolutions on the issue of disarmament, which is of concern to the whole world.

　　The meeting also approved the resolutions of the various committees that had concluded their work. At this point, the 12th session completed the agenda items it should have discussed and should be closed. However, US representative Lodge, with the help of General Assembly President Munro and the so-called "Special Envoy on the Hungarian Question" Wan Wai-ye Kang, made trouble by re-raising the so-called "Hungarian Question."

　　Lodge spoke as the defender of the traitors of the Hungarian people. He said that if the United States deemed it "necessary," it would request a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the issue again. Obviously, Lodge realized that his provocative behavior would not be supported by the majority of UN member states, and he did not formally propose a motion.

　　Next to speak was Soviet representative Sobolev, who pointed out that the US representative was once again attempting to use the UN General Assembly to intensify the "Cold War" and strain international relations, which was clearly contrary to the purposes of the United Nations.

　　Hungarian representative Szik retaliated against the US representative's provocative attacks. He said that the Hungarian government firmly opposed any discussion of the so-called "Hungarian Question" by the UN General Assembly and considered such discussion to be interference in Hungary's internal affairs.

　　Lodge's provocation failed, and the 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly finally closed at 8:05 p.m. local time.

　　联合国大会第十二届会议闭幕
    库兹涅佐夫对会议的工作做了正确的评价
    洛奇在最后一分钟仍想煽动冷战遭到抨击
    据新华社16日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会第十二届会议已经在14日闭幕。
    在全体闭幕会议上，代表们审查了政治委员会关于各国和平共处问题的建议，并且以七十七票对零票一致通过了这个决议案。
    通过的决议全文如下：
      “大会，
    考虑到巩固国际和平和发展各国之间的和平睦邻关系而不管这些国家的分歧或者它们的政治、经济和社会发展的阶段和性质有何不同的迫切性和重要性，
    忆及宪章的基本目标中有维护世界和平和安全以及各国之间进行友好合作，
    认识到有必要遵照宪章的规定来促进这些目标和发展各国之间以互相尊重、互利、互不侵犯、互相尊重主权、平等、领土完整、互不干涉内政为基础的和平和容忍态度，以及实现宪章的宗旨和原则。
    确认有必要扩大国际合作、缓和紧张局势、通过和平方法来解决国与国之间的分歧和纠纷。
    特要求所有国家尽一切努力来巩固国际和平，发展友好合作关系，并且按照宪章所规定的和本决议所提出的和平方法来解决纠纷。”
    苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫在闭幕会议上发言，对联合国大会第十二届会议的工作做了评价。
    他说，本届会议虽然没有全部完成它的任务，但是必须指出它的某些肯定方面。
    首先，大会就各国和平共处这样重要的问题一致通过了决议。大会讨论了对叙利亚的军事侵略的威胁问题，这毫无疑问是有积极意义的。这次讨论是制止对叙利亚人民进行军事进攻的一个重要因素，从而对维护中近东和世界和平作出了重要贡献。但是，本届会议对于全世界都关心的裁军问题没有做出切实的决议，对这一点不能不表示遗憾。
    会议还批准了已经结束工作的各个委员会的各项决议。至此，第十二届会议完成了它应该讨论的各项议程，应当闭幕。但是美国代表洛奇利用大会主席孟罗和所谓“匈牙利问题特使”旺·威泰耶康的效劳，进行了捣乱，重新提出所谓“匈牙利问题”。
    洛奇以匈牙利人民叛徒的辩护人身份发言。他说，如果美国认为“有必要的话”，它将要求召开联合国大会特别会议再来讨论这个问题。显然洛奇意识到他的挑衅行为得不到大多数联合国会员国的支持，他没有正式提出提案。
    接着发言的是苏联代表索波列夫，他指出，美国代表又一次企图利用联大来加强“冷战”和使国际关系紧张，而这显然是同联合国的宗旨相违背的。
    匈牙利代表西克回击美国代表的挑衅性的攻击。他说，匈牙利政府坚决反对联大对所谓“匈牙利问题”作任何讨论，并且认为这种讨论是对匈牙利内政的干涉。
    洛奇的挑衅没有得逞，联合国大会第十二届会议最后在当地时间晚上八时零五分闭幕。
