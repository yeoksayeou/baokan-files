    New Year's Eve Thoughts
    Liang Ruhui
    1957 was an extraordinary year, and 1958 will be an even more extraordinary year.
    The Second Five-Year Plan begins tomorrow. 1958 unveils the prelude to even larger-scale construction.
    Catching up with Britain in fifteen years begins tomorrow. 1958 sounds the bugle for competition with imperialism.
    Tempered in the crucible of the 1957 struggle, we will enter 1958 with full confidence and heroic strides.
    "The sound of firecrackers dispels the old."
    This New Year's Eve, let's think about: What "old" should we dispel?
    I remember when I was a child during the New Year, I would help the adults wipe the old bronze ware on the offering table with a dry cloth. The bronze ware was originally shiny, but over time, it accumulated a lot of dust or grease and had long become dull. It had to be scrubbed with ash to reveal its luster again.
    This makes me think that many of us should wipe our thoughts. In the past seven or eight years, we have been lax in enduring hardship and accustomed to comfort, living in tall buildings and no longer eating dry rations and millet. Over time, our thoughts, like old bronze ware, have become covered with dust, even moldy and rusty.
    Example one: An old cadre who has participated in the revolution for twenty years, in recent years, due to the gradual decline of revolutionary will, showed unstable stand and displayed a sense of excessive mildness in the anti-Rightist struggle; showed irresponsibility and complacency in his work; and finally, showed moral depravity in his life.
    Example two: A writer, originally grew up in the Liberated Areas and had written some good works; but after entering a big city and living in a Western-style house, traveling in cars, making several suits of Western clothes, and buying an overcoat for eight hundred yuan, he never thought of going among the working people again, so naturally there were no more works.
    These are two examples, but also two mirrors. These two people may have many differences, but they have one thing in common: their minds are contaminated with the germs of bourgeois decadent thoughts.
    "Jade that is not carved cannot become a useful object," let alone something that is moldy and rusty!
    Without dispelling the "old," there can be no renewal.
    Look, what kind of burden has history placed on our shoulders! We must not only complete tasks that predecessors have never done before, but also realize dreams that predecessors never dared to dream of!
    What we need is the drive to make mountains bow and rivers give way, the socialist drive! What we oppose is sighing and groaning, and following old ways and being lazy!
    What we need is to transform the negative into the positive, find solutions from unfavorable situations, and work diligently! What we oppose is shouting about difficulties, fearing failure, or standing aside pointing fingers, making empty remarks, and not taking action!
    Sing and move forward, the future belongs to us!

    除夕随感
    梁汝怀
    1957年是不平常的一年，1958年是更不平常的一年。
    第二个五年计划，从明天就开始。1958年揭开了更大规模建设的序幕。
    十五年赶上英国，从明天就开始。1958年吹响了同帝国主义竞赛的号角。
    在1957年斗争的洪炉里锻炼出来的，将满怀信心，以豪迈的脚步勇往直前，跨入1958年。
    “爆竹一声除旧”。
    今年除夕，不妨想一想：除什么“旧”？
    记得小时候过年时，要帮大人用一块干布擦供桌上的旧铜器。铜器原是亮闪闪的，天长日久，沾上不少灰尘或油腻，早就黯然失色了。非得用灰擦一下，才又显出光泽来。
    由此我想我们许多人，该去擦一下思想。这七八年来，疏于艰苦，习于安乐，住在高楼大厦，早就不吃干粮小米了，一来二去，思想就像旧铜器一样沾上尘土，甚至发了霉，生了锈。
    例子之一：有一位参加革命二十年的老干部，几年来，由于革命意志日渐衰退，在反右派斗争中表现了立场不稳，温情主义；在工作上表现不负责任，得过且过；最后，在生活上也表现道德败坏。
    例子之二：有一位作家，原是在解放区长大的，也写过一些好作品；可是进了大城市住进洋房，出入坐汽车，西装一做好几套，大衣一件八百元，终日莳花养鱼，再也不想到劳动人民中去，自然也就没有作品了。
    这是两个例子，但也是两面镜子。这两个人也许有许多不同之处，但有一点是共同的：思想里都沾上了资产阶级腐朽思想的霉菌。
    “玉不琢，不成器”，何况是发了霉、生了锈的！
    不除“旧”，不能更新。
    瞧一瞧吧，历史把什么样的担子放在我们肩上了啊！我们不仅要完成前人所未有过的事业，而且要实现前人所根本不敢做的梦想！
    我们需要的，是要高山低头、河水让路的干劲，社会主义干劲！我们反对的是唉声叹气，因循怠惰！
    我们需要的，是化消极为积极，从不利中找出办法，埋头苦干！我们反对的是喊困难，怕失败；或是站在一旁指手划脚，空发议论，而不动手去做！
    高歌前进吧，未来是属于我们的！
