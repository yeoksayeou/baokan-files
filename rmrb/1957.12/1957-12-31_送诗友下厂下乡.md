    Seeing Off Poetry Friends Going Down to Factories and Countryside
    Zang Kejia
    Several of my poetry-writing friends have gone down to factories and the countryside, one after another.

    Comrade Ruan Zhangjing was the first to go, and he is in "Baotou Steel," where he has successively published some poems reflecting the great construction. We expect him to write works even more excellent than "Zhanghe River Water," and this expectation will not be disappointed.

    Comrade Yan Chen has now arrived on the Songhua River. I happened to meet him a few days before he left. Although it was brief, I heard the joy of returning to his hometown in his cheerful conversation. Comrade Yan Chen once went to Korea and brought back anti-US, aid-Korea poems that were well received by readers. This time, going deep into the struggle life, he is sure to have a fruitful harvest.

    When Comrade Tian Jian came to say goodbye, we had a cordial heart-to-heart talk under the bright light. He spoke of his plan for "ten long poems." This trip to the countryside is a favorable condition for completing his poetry creation. In the past year or two, Comrade Tian Jian has often gone down to life. He has been to Inner Mongolia and Kunming. Each time he goes down, he gains a lot. Each time he comes back, his life has more new things, and his poems have added some new flavor. Comrade Tian Jian is very simple. When he was in Yan'an, he worked in the countryside for a considerable period of time, with a sheepskin towel wrapped around his bald head. He was a good worker and also a good poet. Now, he is going back to the countryside again. When he walked out of my house, he tightly shook my hand and said, "When spring blossoms, come to my place as a guest. You like the countryside very much."

    As I write this short farewell article, Comrade Li Ji is probably already back at his Yumen Oil Mine. It was here that he wrote many beloved poems. His foothold is in the Northwest. When he told me that he was going to Yumen, Sanbian, and the Qaidam Basin..., my small house suddenly became vast, and my heart seemed to want to fly.

    I listened to him talking about his writing plan for a long poem: how a young child went through thousands of mountains and rivers and grew up in the revolutionary ranks. In terms of form, he also wants to write it in a way that everyone can understand when it is read aloud, while maintaining its artistic level, like "Jiao Erjin." I am waiting for the birth of "Jiao Erjin" from Comrade Li Ji's pen, and at the same time, I hope he will forgive me for revealing his creative plan. On the eve of his departure, he entrusted someone to send me two red beans he brought back from Guangdong. Comrade Li Ji, in the days when we are separated, I will often think of the long days we spent together in Zhan Shan, Qingdao, and I will often think of everything about you.
    Seeing these poetry friends going deep into life one after another (of course, not just these four), my emotions are very agitated, and I cannot calm down for many days. I think that these few have all been tempered in the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an and are walking ahead of me. Today, the motherland has entered the era of socialism, everything is advancing by leaps and bounds, and everything is changing. In order to temper and transform themselves, in order to integrate more closely with the workers and peasants, and in order to make their colorful pens bloom, they have once again gone deep into factories and the countryside. I will naturally think of myself. I have received very little revolutionary training in the past, and there are some petty-bourgeois remnants in my thoughts and feelings. These things unconsciously pop up at a certain time, on a certain occasion. The erroneous article "Denying Relatives" (published in the People's Daily supplement on May 3rd) was because I failed to analyze the problem with the thinking of the working class. Taking making friends as an example, in our new society, the primary condition for making friends is to have the same goals and aspirations, that is, to stand on the same revolutionary front. If we deviate from the class stand and simply pursue "the warmth of friendship," that is wrong. It has been eight months since I wrote that article, but I still feel heartbroken when I think about it. It is easy to say "stand firm on the class stand," but it is very difficult to make the activation of one's own thoughts and feelings naturally arise from class instinct. How to transform oneself is a problem for every intellectual, and it is even more urgent for me. In recent years, I feel that my thoughts and feelings have undergone considerable changes, and my senses are not too slow to new things, so I am often moved and aroused by a kind of passion. However, lacking a deep understanding of the life of struggle, one's own thoughts and feelings also lack a solid foundation. In recent years, I have been restricted by illness, and not only can I not go deep into life, but even a cursory observation requires a lot of effort. I am unwilling to do so, but I have no choice but to do so, and my heart is painful. Especially after seeing off these poetry friends who are often together, this pain is even more aggravated for a while. However, I will temper myself, transform myself, and improve myself in work and study.

    As their friend, I naturally have a feeling of reluctance to part. However, we are still closely connected. In the future, we will replace the joy of face-to-face talks with reading each other's new works. Even if we cannot write poems temporarily, we only need to think that everyone is living in the torrent of battle, and we will feel infinitely comforted.

### 送诗友下厂下乡

    送诗友下厂下乡
    臧克家
    写诗的朋友们，有好几位已经先后下厂下乡了。
    阮章竞同志走在最前头，他在“包钢”，已经陆续地发表了一些反映伟大建设面貌的诗篇了。我们期待着他写出比“漳河水”更优秀的作品来，这个期待是不会落空的。
    严辰同志，现在已经到了松花江上。他走的头几天，曾经碰到过，虽然为时匆匆，但我从他欢笑的谈吐里，听到了如归故乡的快乐心情。严辰同志，曾经到过朝鲜，带回来的抗美援朝诗篇，受到了读者的欢迎，这一次深入到斗争生活里去，一定是会丰收的。
    田间同志，来辞别的时候，在明亮的灯光下，我们曾经亲切地谈心。他说着他“十个长诗”的计划。这次到农村里去，对于完成他的诗创作是一个有利的条件。这一、二年来，田间同志时常下到生活里去，他到过内蒙古，到过昆明，每次下去，收获都不少。每次回来，他的生活里多了些新的东西，他的诗里也增添了一些新的情味。田间同志是很朴素的，在延安的时候，他有一段不短的时间在乡村里工作，光光的头上包一条羊肚子毛巾，他是一个很好的工作人员，他也是一个很好的诗人。现在，他又要回到农村去了。走出我的房子的时候，他紧紧地握住我的手说：“春暖花开的时候，到我那里去作客去吧，你是很喜欢农村的。”
    在我写这篇送别的短文的时候，李季同志大概已经回到他的玉门油矿了。就是在这里，他写过许多令人喜爱的诗篇。他的安身立命之处是西北，当他向我说着，他将要到玉门，到三边，到柴达木盆地……，我的小房子，一时变得海阔天空，我的心好似要飞起来似的。
    我听他说着他的长诗的写作计划：一个年轻的孩子，怎样走过了千山万水，在革命队伍里锻炼成长。他在形式方面，也要写得念出来人人能听懂，同时保持它的艺术水平，像“焦尔金”那样。我在等待着李季同志笔下“焦尔金”的诞生，同时希望他原谅我泄露了他的创作计划。临行前夕，他托人送给我他从广东带回来的两颗红豆，李季同志呵，在我们分手的日子里，我会常常想到我们在青岛湛山一同度过的那些长长的日子，我也会常常想到你的一切。看着这些诗友们一个又一个深入到生活里去（当然不止他们四位），我的情感是很激动的，好多天不能平复。我想，他们这几位，都曾经在延安的革命圣地受过锻炼，走在我的前边。今天，祖国进入了社会主义的时代，一切都在突飞猛晋，一切都在变化着。他们为了锻炼、改造自己，为了使自己更密切地和工人农民打成一片，为了使自己的彩笔生花，又深入到工厂、乡村里去。我自然会想到我自己。我过去受到的革命锻炼很少，在思想情感里面存在着一些小资产阶级的残余，这些东西，不自觉地在某个时间，某一场合，突然冒出头来。我写过“六亲不认”（载5月3日人民日报副刊）的错误文章，就是因为没能够用工人阶级思想去分析问题。就以交友而论，在我们的新社会里，交朋友的首要条件是志同道合，也就是站在一条革命战线上，如果离开了阶级立场，单纯的去追求“友情的温暖”，那是错误的。现在离开我写那篇文章的时间已经八个月了，但一想起来，还是痛心不已。说一句“站稳阶级立场”容易，真的使自己的思想情感的发动，自然的出乎阶级本能，那就是一件十分困难的事情了。如何改造自己，这是每一个知识分子的问题，它对我更是迫切。这些年来，自己觉得思想情感都有了不小的变化，对于新鲜事物，感觉也还不迟钝，因而时常被打动，引起一种激情。但是，缺乏对斗争生活的深入，个人的思想情感也就缺少一个巩固的基础。这些年来，被疾病管制着，不但不能深入生活，就是走马看花也得费力挣扎。不甘如此，但又不得不如此，我的心是痛苦的。特别在送走了这些时常在一起的诗友们以后，这种痛苦一时就更加重起来。但是，我是要在工作中，在学习中，锻炼自己，改造自己，提高自己的。
    作为我的朋友，他们走了，当然有一种惜别之感。但是，彼此还是紧紧地联系着的。今后，彼此会以读到对方的新作代替面谈的快乐，即使暂时写不出诗来，彼此只想到大家都生活在战斗的激流中，心里也就无限快慰了。
