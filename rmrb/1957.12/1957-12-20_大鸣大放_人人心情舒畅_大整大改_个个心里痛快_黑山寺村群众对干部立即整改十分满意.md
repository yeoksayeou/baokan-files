Great Blooming and Contending Make Everyone Feel Happy; Great Rectification and Reform Make Everyone Feel Satisfied
Heishansi Village Masses Are Very Satisfied with the Immediate Rectification of Cadres

(Reported by this newspaper) In the rectification movement in Heishansi Village, Zhuolu County, Hebei Province, after mobilizing great blooming and contending, immediate rectification was carried out, and the masses were very satisfied.

After the great blooming and contending in this village, by November 25th, a total of 736 opinions of various kinds had been put forward. Among them, 650 were correct and needed to be resolved immediately; 55, while correct, could not be resolved immediately; and 31 needed to be debated by the masses. Of the 650 opinions that needed to be resolved, 95% had been resolved by December 3rd. After these problems were expressed, most of the masses were most concerned about whether these opinions could be resolved quickly. Based on this situation, the village branch immediately shifted to rectification. The village and commune cadres first dealt promptly with more than 80 problems raised by the commune members, such as the commune cadres not participating in labor, the undemocratic work style, and the chaotic labor distribution, which caused waste of manpower. Among them, the issue of team cadres occupying too many work points was the most and largest concern of the masses. The commune immediately deducted the 9,831 work points that had been over-occupied by the 36 team cadres, making the autumn harvest distribution fair and reasonable. The commune and team cadres all expressed their guarantee to participate properly in productive labor in the future. Regarding the issues of production, operation and management, and financial management raised by the commune members, the commune management committee also studied and handled them one by one, and the commune cadres made a review and explanation at the meeting of commune member representatives.

In order to thoroughly improve their work, the village and commune cadres adopted the method of full consultation between cadres and the masses to solve the difficult problems related to the work that the masses raised, and concentrated the wisdom of the masses to solve them. Many commune members, seeing that the cadres had not only reviewed their own shortcomings and mistakes, but also trusted the masses so much, actively helped the commune cadres to find ways to solve the problems. Originally, the commune thought that the problem of the commune members' proposal that there was a shortage of forty pack animals was difficult to solve, but after consultation with the masses and mobilizing everyone to find ways, the commune members of each production team repaired broken baskets and used sacks to load manure, solving the difficulty of transporting manure. Many commune members also automatically went to the mountains to cut branches, preparing to weave baskets. Through everyone contributing ideas and everyone finding solutions, the masses solved 390 problems themselves, accounting for 60% of the problems that should be solved immediately in the whole village. The masses were very satisfied with this, and they said: "Great blooming and contending make everyone feel happy; great rectification and reform make everyone feel satisfied!"

After rectification, the enthusiasm of the masses for production has also increased. The canal excavation project, which had been suspended after the snow, has now started again. The number of people working in the whole commune has increased three times compared to before the snow. All 156 livestock in the village have been put into manure transportation. The village is now mobilizing the masses to launch a debate on the erroneous remarks that were expressed by the masses.

    大鸣大放　人人心情舒畅  大整大改　个个心里痛快
    黑山寺村群众对干部立即整改十分满意
    本报讯　河北省涿鹿县黑山寺村在开展整风运动中，发动大鸣大放以后，立即进行整改，群众非常满意。
    这村经过大鸣大放，到11月25日，共提出各种意见七百三十六条。其中正确的，需要马上解决的有六百五十条；问题提的虽然正确，但不能马上解决的有五十五条；需要交群众辩论的有三十一条。需要解决的六百五十条意见中，到12月3日，已有95％得到解决。这些问题鸣放出来以后，多数群众最关心的是这些意见能不能很快得到解决。村支部根据这个情况，立即转入整改。村、社干部首先对社员提出的社干部不参加劳动，作风不民主，劳力支配太乱，造成窝工浪费等八十多个问题及时进行了处理。其中群众意见最多最大的是队干部多占工分问题，社里马上把三十六个队干部多占的九千八百三十一个工分减去，使秋收分配达到了公平合理。社、队干部都表示保证今后好好参加生产劳动。对社员提出的生产经营管理、财务管理等问题，社管理委员会也逐条进行了研究处理，社干部并在社员代表大会上进行了检查交代。
    村、社干部为了彻底地改进工作，对群众提出的属于工作中需要改进的困难问题，采取了干部和群众充分协商的办法，集中群众的智慧加以解决。许多社员见到干部既检查了本身的缺点错误，又这样相信群众，都积极帮助社干部想办法，解决问题。原来社里认为社员提出的缺少四十副驮的问题不好解决，但经过与群众协商，发动大家想办法，各生产队社员修补了破筐和用口袋装粪，解决了送粪的困难。许多社员还自动上山割条子，准备编筐。经过人人出主意，个个想办法，群众自己解决了三百九十个问题，占全村应该马上解决的问题的60％。这样作群众十分满意，他们说：“大鸣大放，人人心情舒畅；大整大改，个个心里痛快！”
    整改以后，群众生产积极性也提高了，原来在雪后停工的开渠工程，现在又动了工，全社比雪前出工人数增加了三倍。全村一百五十六头牲口，已全部投入送粪。对群众鸣放出的错误言论，现在正发动群众展开辩论。
