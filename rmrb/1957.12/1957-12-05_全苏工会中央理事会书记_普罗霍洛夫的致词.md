Comrades,

　　Allow me, on behalf of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and the millions of workers and intellectuals organized within the Soviet trade unions, to extend warm fraternal greetings to the delegates of the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions and to all the working people of your great socialist construction nation!

　　The Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions holds great significance in the lives of the people of the People's Republic of China. At this congress, you will not only summarize the work of the Chinese trade unions over the past four years, but also the achievements of the Chinese working class, under the glorious leadership of its Communist Party, in the heroic labor of profoundly transforming its country.

　　The Chinese people have achieved tremendous success in all aspects of socialist construction, and the whole world bears witness to these achievements. The working people of the People's Republic of China are successfully realizing the tasks put forward by the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China—to vigorously develop production, increase the country's productive forces, and build China into a powerful socialist industrial nation.

　　China is already capable of manufacturing its own automobiles, airplanes, modern machine tools, and machinery. The production of steel and iron has increased many times over, and the output of various industrial products has also increased. Agricultural production has also seen great development, all of which makes us sincerely happy. The whole world rejoices in the achievements made by the People's Republic of China in developing people's culture, and in the elimination of illiteracy among millions of workers and peasants in the era of the people's regime.

　　The Chinese trade unions have become the most mass-based organization of the working people, and they have made outstanding contributions to China's socialist construction. The Chinese trade unions are faithful executors of the policies of the Chinese Communist Party. They encourage the working people to strive to fulfill and overfulfill the national economic plan, to discover and utilize production potential, to resolutely strive to adopt new technologies, to promote the experience of advanced producers, to care for meeting the growing material and cultural needs of workers and staff, and to educate workers and staff to adopt a communist attitude toward labor. The resolute struggle of the Chinese trade unions against bureaucracy and against the bourgeois rightists who attempted to prevent the People's Republic of China from taking the socialist road is of great significance.

　　The Chinese trade unions actively participate in the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions, tirelessly fight for the unity of international trade unions, and for enhancing the unity of the working people of all countries, thereby earning a high reputation in the international labor movement. The Chinese trade unions resolutely safeguard world peace, uphold the trade union rights and democratic rights of the working people, and consistently assist the people of countries fighting against colonialism for their national independence. They are faithful to the great Marxist-Leninist principle of proletarian internationalism.

　　Comrades! The achievements made by the Chinese working people in the economic and political fields have shown the whole world how great achievements can be made in economic and cultural construction by people who have freed themselves from capitalist and colonial oppression. This convincingly proves the incomparable superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, and the powerful vitality of Marxist-Leninist ideas.

　　The great achievements of the Chinese people are the result of the victory of the people's revolution. It should be said that the victory of the people's revolution is one of the most important transformations in human history, and a glorious milestone on the victorious road that began with the October Socialist Revolution forty years ago. People's China has firmly embarked on the path of socialist development and has become a huge force in socialist countries' cooperation.

　　The era in which the Soviet Union was an isolated island in the capitalist world has passed. Socialism has gone beyond the confines of one country and become a world system. The people of a series of European and Asian countries are advancing along the path of socialist construction together with the Soviet Union and China. The socialist camp is growing stronger and more consolidated, and the future belongs to the socialist camp.

　　The increasingly declining capitalist system is experiencing an ever-deepening crisis. The colonial system is collapsing, and both the contradictions between various monopoly capital groups and the contradictions between various capitalist countries are becoming increasingly acute. Conversely, the world socialist system has set an example to the world of the close-knit, truly equal, and selfless cooperation of socialist countries, an example of rapid economic development based on mutual assistance and the vigorous development of science and culture, and an example of people who have become masters of their own country after shaking off capitalist oppression exercising their talents.

　　The aim of socialist society is to maximize the satisfaction of the people's growing needs. It is precisely for this purpose that socialist countries want to develop the productive forces and increase the wealth of their countries. In 1956, the production of socialist countries increased more than threefold compared to 1937. There is no capitalist country in the world that has been able to secure so much welfare for the working people in such a short historical period as socialist countries. At present, the socialist system already possesses a highly developed industrial base, and socialist countries have the possibility of further rapidly developing their economies and continuously raising the living standards of the working people.

　　The working people of the whole world are increasingly recognizing the tremendous superiority of the socialist path of development. The figures for the increase in production and the improvement in the living standards of the people in socialist countries, the great construction of China, and the successful launching of artificial earth satellites by the Soviet Union, all illustrate this point.

　　The historically significant achievements of socialist countries have aroused the working people of the whole world to fight for their social liberation and have promoted the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of colonial and dependent countries. At present, the forces of democracy and progress have grown stronger than ever before. The world communist movement and the workers' movement have developed and been tempered in struggle and have become a huge force.

　　In order to find a way out of the deepening internal contradictions and to hinder the victorious advance of the forces of democracy and socialism, the imperialists are stepping up the arms race to promote the aggravation of the international situation and are preparing for war against socialist countries.

　　Under this situation, the task of the trade union movements of our two countries is to vigorously promote the further consolidation of the socialist camp; to strive for the continuous upsurge of the national economies of our two countries and the continuous enhancement of our economic strength; and to consolidate and develop the friendship of all nationalities.

　　The fraternal friendship and close cooperation between the peoples of the Soviet Union, China, and all socialist countries are a powerful fortress of world peace and a guarantee of their happy future. This friendship and cooperation are a model of genuinely equal relations between countries, an equality based on the desire to help each other in realizing the great goals of building socialism and communism.

　　Comrades! Not long ago, the Soviet Union and progressive humanity throughout the world joyfully celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. The summary of our country's socialist development shows that the Soviet Union has now become a powerful industrial country.

　　Our country has already ranked second in the world in terms of industrial development. Now, we already possess all the necessary conditions to strive to solve a basic economic task in the shortest historical period, that is, to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of the per capita output of industrial products. Under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party, which holds high the victorious banner of the October Revolution and the banner of Marxism-Leninism, the Soviet people have already won this great victory in the construction of socialism.

　　The Soviet trade unions have also made a great contribution to winning this victory. In our country, it is a huge force that has a good influence on all aspects of the country's production and social life. The role played by the Soviet trade unions in the economic and cultural construction of our country is growing day by day.

　　Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet trade unions are organizing the working people to fight for the further strengthening of our country's power. At the same time, the Soviet trade unions are also concerned with meeting the growing material and cultural needs of workers and staff, and consistently advocate friendship between all countries and the strengthening of the international solidarity of trade unions.

　　In response to the call in the "Letter to All the People of the Soviet Union" issued by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, the Soviet trade unions are redoubling their efforts to strive for a new upsurge in the national economy and to win new victories in the construction of communism.

　　Comrades! The achievements made by the working people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries are extremely great. The historically significant declaration of the meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries held in Moscow from November 14 to 16, 1957, is a vivid manifestation of the powerful strength of the socialist camp.

　　The concluding remarks of the declaration inspire the working people of the whole world with hope and confidence in our happy future. It points out that the working class and people of all countries, under the leadership of their Communist and Workers' Parties, "will surely be able to overcome all obstacles on the road forward and achieve new and great victories for the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism on a world scale."

　　However, we are by no means satisfied with the achievements we have already made, and we still have much to do.

　　The Peace Manifesto adopted by the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties is an appeal to all workers and peasants, to all men and women, and to all good people in the world.

　　The Peace Manifesto calls on people to maintain a high degree of vigilance against the conspiracies of warmongers and to fight more actively for peace.

　　Further mobilizing all our forces to strive for a new upsurge in our country's culture and economy, and striving for the unity of the world trade union movement to safeguard peace and security in all countries—this is the guiding principle of our Soviet trade union activities.

　　Allow me to wish the Chinese trade unions and all the Chinese people new and great achievements in the cause of socialist construction. Allow me, on behalf of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, to assure the Congress that the Soviet trade unions will continue to work for the common progress of our two countries towards new victories on the basis of close fraternal unity.

　　The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions has entrusted our delegation to deliver greetings to the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions on behalf of the Soviet trade unions.

　　Please allow me to read out the full text of the greetings:

　　Greetings to the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions

Dear Comrades and Friends!

　　The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions extends warm fraternal greetings to the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions on behalf of all Soviet workers and staff.

　　The Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions is convened at a time when the trade unions have achieved great success in their work. Under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese trade unions are successfully solving the task of inspiring the working people to fight for the completion of the great socialist construction, and are carrying out great work in educating workers and staff and meeting their daily life needs.

　　All the Soviet people celebrate with excitement the great achievements made by the Chinese working people in the era of the people's regime. Six hundred million Chinese people are closely united around the Chinese Communist Party, and are advancing confidently along the road of building a free, prosperous, and socialist China. China is building its own powerful industry, completing the historically significant transformation of agriculture, and carrying out great work in developing culture.

　　From the example of China, which suffered from the exploitation and plunder of foreign capitalists for hundreds of years, the people of the world can see how great achievements can be made by people who have overthrown imperialist oppression and seized power.

　　Now, great People's China is a growing and huge force in international life.

　　The People's Republic of China is a huge force in the great socialist camp, and it has made a great contribution to the cause of defending world peace.

　　Faithful to the principles of proletarian internationalism, the Chinese trade unions actively promote the consolidation of friendship between the peoples of all countries, develop contacts with the working people and trade unions of all countries, and carry out effective work in the World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　The Chinese and Soviet trade unions are actively developing and consolidating the unbreakable friendship and close cooperation between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. This is of inestimable significance for the cause of peace, for the cause of socialism and communism.

　　Let us continue to work to consolidate the friendship between the trade unions and the working people of our two countries—a factor in the prosperity of our two fraternal peoples and a reliable fortress of peace.

　　The Soviet trade unions wish the Chinese trade unions further great achievements in the cause of socialist construction and in all-round activities for the benefit of the working people.

　　Long live the Chinese working class and its fighting organization—the All-China Federation of Trade Unions!

　　Long live the eternal friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union!

　　Long live the unbreakable unity of the great socialist camp—the guarantee of socialist and communist construction and world peace in our two countries!

All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions

### 全苏工会中央理事会书记　普罗霍洛夫的致词

专栏：

　　全苏工会中央理事会书记
　　普罗霍洛夫的致词同志们：
    请允许我代表全苏工会中央理事会、代表组织在苏联工会中的千百万工人和知识分子向中国工会第八次全国代表大会的代表，向你们建设社会主义的伟大国家的全体劳动人民，致以热烈的兄弟般的敬礼！
    中国工会第八次全国代表大会在中华人民共和国人民的生活中具有很重大的意义。在这次大会上，不仅要总结四年来中国工会的工作，而且要总结中国工人阶级在自己的光荣的共产党领导下对自己的国家顺利地进行着极深刻的改造的英勇劳动的成果。
    中国人民在社会主义建设的各个方面都取得了巨大的成就，全世界就是这些成就的见证人。中华人民共和国的劳动人民正在顺利地实现中国共产党第八次全国代表大会所提出的任务——大力地发展生产、提高国家的生产力，将中国建设成为强大的社会主义工业国。
    中国已经能够自己制造汽车、飞机、现代化的机床、机器，钢和铁的产量都提高了许多倍，各种工业品的产量也都提高了。农业生产也有了很大的发展，所有这些，都使我们衷心感到高兴。全世界都为中华人民共和国在发展人民文化中所取得的成就而欢欣鼓舞，都为在人民政权的年代里扫除了千百万的工人农民文盲而欢欣鼓舞。
    中国工会已经成为劳动人民最具有群众性的组织，它对中国的社会主义建设事业作出了卓越的贡献。中国工会是中国共产党的政策的忠实执行者，它鼓舞劳动人民为完成和超额完成国民经济计划、发掘和运用生产潜力而奋斗，坚决地争取采用新技术，推广先进生产者的经验，关心满足职工日益增长的物质和文化生活的需要，教育职工以共产主义的态度对待劳动。中国工会反对官僚主义和反对企图阻止中华人民共和国走社会主义道路的资产阶级右派分子的坚决斗争，具有很重大的意义。
    中国工会积极地参加世界工会联合会的活动，不倦地为国际工会的统一，为增进各国劳动人民的团结而斗争，从而在国际工人运动中赢得了很高的威信。中国工会坚决地维护世界和平，维护劳动人民的工会权利与民主权利，一贯援助为争取自己的民族独立而反对殖民主义的国家的人民。它忠实于伟大的马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级国际主义的原则。
    同志们！中国的劳动人民在经济和政治方面所取得的成就，已向全世界表明，摆脱了资本主义和殖民主义压迫的人民在经济和文化建设方面能够取得多么伟大的成就。这令人信服地证明了，社会主义制度比资本主义制度具有无可比拟的优越性，证明了马克思列宁主义思想具有强大的生命力。
    中国人民所取得的伟大成就，是人民革命胜利的结果。应当说，人民革命的胜利是人类历史上一个最重大的转变，是从四十年前十月社会主义革命开始的胜利道路上的光荣的里程碑。人民中国坚定地走上了社会主义发展的道路，并且成为社会主义国家合作中的一支巨大力量。
    苏联作为资本主义世界中的一个孤岛的时代已经过去了。社会主义已经超出了一个国家的范围而成为一个世界体系。一系列的欧洲和亚洲国家的人民，正同苏联和中国一起沿着社会主义建设的道路前进。社会主义阵营在强大和巩固中，未来是属于社会主义阵营的。
    日益衰落的资本主义制度经历着愈来愈深刻的危机。殖民主义制度在崩溃，无论是各个垄断资本集团之间的矛盾也好，或者是各个资本主义国家之间的矛盾也好，都在日益尖锐化。相反地，世界社会主义体系却向全世界作出了社会主义国家亲密无间、真正平等和大公无私的合作的榜样，作出了在互相帮助以及科学、文化蓬勃发展的基础上迅速发展经济的榜样，作出了摆脱资本主义压迫成为国家主人的人们发挥自己才能的榜样。
    社会主义社会的目的是最大限度地满足人民日益增长的需要。正是为了这个目的，社会主义国家要发展生产力，要增加自己国家的财富。1956年社会主义国家的生产比1937年增加了三倍多。在世界上，没有任何一个资本主义国家能够像社会主义国家那样，在短短的历史时期内为劳动人民谋取了这样多的福利。目前，社会主义体系已经拥有高度发展的工业基础，社会主义国家有可能进一步迅速地发展自己的经济，不断地提高劳动人民的生活水平。
    全世界劳动人民愈来愈认清了社会主义发展道路的巨大优越性。社会主义国家生产提高的数字和人民生活水平提高的数字，中国的伟大建设以及苏联成功地发射了人造地球卫星等，所有这些都说明了这一点。
    社会主义国家具有历史意义的成就，唤起了全世界劳动人民为争取自己的社会解放而奋斗，推进了殖民地和附属国家人民的反帝国主义斗争。目前，民主和进步的力量已经空前地壮大起来。世界共产主义运动和工人运动在斗争中得到了发展和锻炼，成为一支巨大的力量。
    帝国主义者为了寻找摆脱日益加深的内部矛盾的出路，阻挠民主与社会主义力量的胜利前进，正在加紧军备竞赛以促成国际形势的尖锐化并且准备反对社会主义国家的战争。
    在这种形势下，我们两国工会运动的任务就是：大力促进社会主义阵营的进一步巩固；为我们两国国民经济的不断高涨、经济力量的不断增强而奋斗；巩固与发展各族人民的友谊。
    苏联、中国和所有社会主义国家人民间的兄弟友谊与亲密合作是世界和平的强大堡垒，是它们幸福的未来的保证。这种友谊与合作是国家之间的真正平等关系的典范，这种平等关系是建立在为实现建设社会主义和共产主义的伟大目标而互相帮助的愿望的基础上的。
    同志们！不久以前，苏联和全世界的进步人类欢欣鼓舞地庆祝了伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年。我国社会主义发展的总结表明，苏联现在已成为强大的工业国家。
    我们的国家在工业发展方面已经居于世界第二位。现在，我们已经拥有一切必需的条件以争取在最短的历史时期内解决一个基本的经济任务，即在按人口计算的工业品的产量方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。在高举着十月革命胜利旗帜和马克思列宁主义旗帜的光荣的共产党的领导下，苏联人民已经在社会主义的建设中赢得了这一伟大的胜利。
    对于这一胜利的赢得，苏联工会也作了巨大的贡献。在我国，它是对于国家的生产与社会生活各个方面起着良好影响的巨大力量。苏联工会在我们国家的经济和文化建设中所起的作用，正在日益增长。
    苏联工会在共产党的领导下，正在组织劳动人民为进一步加强我们国家的威力而斗争，同时，苏联工会还关心满足职工的日益增长的物质需要和文化需要，并且一贯地主张各国人民友好，主张加强工会的国际团结。
    为了响应苏联最高苏维埃为纪念十月革命四十周年所发布的“告苏联全体人民书”中的号召，苏联工会正在加倍努力争取国民经济的新高涨，争取在共产主义的建设中获得新的胜利。
    同志们！苏联、中华人民共和国及其他社会主义国家的劳动人民所获得的成就是极其巨大的。1957年11月14日至16日在莫斯科召开的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的具有历史意义的宣言，就是社会主义阵营的强大力量的鲜明表现。
    宣言的结束语以对我们幸福未来的期望和信心，鼓舞着全世界的劳动者。它指出，各国的工人阶级和人民在自己的共产党和工人党的领导下“一定能够战胜前进道路上的一切障碍，使和平、民主、社会主义事业在世界范围内取得新的伟大的胜利”。
    然而，我们决不满足于已经取得的成就，我们还必须做许多事情。
    共产党和工人党代表会议所通过的和平宣言，是向一切工人和农民的呼吁，向一切男人和妇女的呼吁，向全世界所有的善良的人们的呼吁。
    和平宣言号召人们对战争挑拨者的阴谋保持高度的警惕性，更积极地为争取和平而斗争。
    进一步动员我们所有的力量去争取我国的文化与经济的新高涨，争取世界工会运动的统一以保障各国的和平与安全，这就是我们苏联工会活动的方针。
    请允许我预祝中国工会和全体中国人民在社会主义建设事业中获得新的、巨大的成就。请允许我代表全苏工会中央理事会向代表大会保证，苏联工会今后仍然要为我们两国在亲密无间的兄弟般的团结的基础上共同走向新的胜利而努力。
    全苏工会中央理事会委托我们代表团代表苏联工会向中国工会第八次全国代表大会致祝词。
    请允许我宣读祝词的全文：
　　向中国工会第八次全国代表大会的祝词亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    全苏工会中央理事会代表全体苏联职工向中国工会第八次全国代表大会致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    中国工会第八次全国代表大会是在工会工作获得了巨大的成就的时候召开的。中国工会在光荣的中国共产党的领导下胜利地解决着鼓舞劳动人民为完成伟大的社会主义建设而斗争的任务，实行着教育职工和满足他们日常生活需要的伟大工作。
    全体苏联人民以兴奋的心情庆祝中国劳动人民在人民政权的年代里取得的巨大成就。六亿中国人民紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，满怀信心地沿着建设自由、繁荣的社会主义中国的道路前进。中国正在建设自己的强大的工业，完成有历史意义的农业改造，进行发展文化的巨大工作。
    从中国受过上百年外国资本家的剥削和掠夺这一先例中，全世界人民可以看到，推翻了帝国主义压迫和掌握了政权的人民，能够取得如何巨大的成就。
    现在，伟大的人民中国是国际生活中日益增强的巨大力量。
    在伟大的社会主义阵营中，中华人民共和国是一支巨大的力量，它在保卫世界和平的事业中作出了伟大的贡献。
    忠实于无产阶级国际主义原则的中国工会积极地促进各国人民友谊的巩固，发展与各国劳动人民和工会的联系，在世界工会联合会中进行着具有显著成效的工作。
    中国工会和苏联工会正在一样积极地发展与巩固中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊和亲密无间的合作。这对和平事业，对社会主义和共产主义事业有着不可估量的意义。
    让我们继续为巩固我们两国的工会和劳动人民之间的友谊——我们两国兄弟人民繁荣的因素与和平的可靠堡垒——而努力。
    苏联工会祝中国工会在社会主义建设事业中，在为劳动人民谋福利的全面活动中，进一步获得更大的成就。
    中国工人阶级和它的战斗组织——中华全国总工会万岁！
    中苏两国人民永恒的友谊万岁！
    我们两国社会主义和共产主义建设和世界和平的保证——伟大的社会主义阵营牢不可破的团结万岁！
                          全苏工会中央理事会　1957年12月4日
