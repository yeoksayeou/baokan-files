Xinhua News Agency, December 13th. The friendship between China and Burma, which permeated Beijing during the visit of Burmese Federal Deputy Prime Ministers U Ba Swe and U Kyaw Nyein, reached a new peak at the grand banquet held tonight by Burmese Ambassador to China U Hla Maung.

At the banquet held tonight by the Burmese Ambassador to welcome the two Burmese Deputy Prime Ministers and their wives, Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe repeatedly announced in his speech that Burma would never join any imperialist bloc, any military bloc, or any bloc opposed to the People's Republic of China, and was determined to defend world peace shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese people. Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein also repeatedly congratulated the further development and consolidation of Sino-Burmese friendship on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and congratulated the friendly coexistence of all Asian and African countries and countries around the world. Their speeches were repeatedly interrupted by applause that resounded throughout the hall. Ambassador U Hla Maung also expressed his deep hope for further strengthening the friendship between the two countries at the beginning of the banquet.

Throughout the venue, enthusiastic applause welcomed Premier Zhou Enlai's passionate wishes for friendship between the two countries. Premier Zhou regarded the simultaneous visit of the two Burmese Deputy Prime Ministers to China as an extraordinary gathering in the history of exchanges between the two countries. He believed that "the result of the two distinguished guests' visit to China has greatly advanced the mutual understanding and trust between the two governments and peoples."

Premier Zhou said: "The ever-developing friendly relations between our two countries not only conform to the interests of the two peoples but also conform to the interests of the unity of Asian and African countries. The development of the international situation proves that the unity of Asian and African countries is one of the important factors in maintaining world peace. We have been and will continue to use our friendship as an example to strengthen the unity of Asian and African countries, strengthen the cause of world peace, and prevent attempts to create division and provoke war from succeeding."

Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe gave three impromptu speeches at the banquet. He said: "In the current atomic age, only by living together peacefully according to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence can all countries achieve world peace."

"Now, the whole world is demanding peace and increasingly supporting the Five Principles. Those warmongers who oppose peaceful coexistence are gradually losing the support of the people, will be besieged by the people, and will eventually come to the road of destruction. China and Burma should become examples in implementing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. They should also become examples in friendship between the two countries." In his speech, he also excitedly called Premier Zhou Enlai the founder of Sino-Burmese friendship and the originator of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and wished Premier Zhou to make more important contributions to world peace.

Premier Zhou Enlai thanked Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe for his praise. He said that this should be attributed to all the Chinese people because, without the people, the leaders of our country could not do anything. Premier Zhou Enlai proposed a toast to the health of Burmese Prime Minister U Nu and Indian Prime Minister Nehru, the initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, to the health of President Sukarno, the supporter of the Bandung Conference, and also to the good health of Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe and Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein.

At this moment, the banquet hall of the Beijing Hotel became extraordinarily lively, and everyone, Burmese guests, Chinese people from all walks of life, and diplomats from various countries, drank all the Maotai wine in their glasses.

At the banquet, Premier Zhou also announced good news to everyone: Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe has agreed to come to China again next year for a longer visit to various places. Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe confirmed Premier Zhou Enlai's words in his subsequent speech. The Burmese Deputy Prime Minister said that he would come to China again next year for a longer visit, to meet his old Chinese friends again, and to get to know more new Chinese friends. At this time, the whole audience expressed their sincere welcome to Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe's visit to China again with lasting applause.

The two Burmese Federal Deputy Prime Ministers and Premier Zhou Enlai, Deputy Prime Ministers Peng Dehuai, He Long, and Chen Yi sat at a banquet table. This table became the center of the entire banquet hall filled with unlimited friendship. The two Deputy Prime Ministers and Ministers of Defense, U Ba Swe and Peng Dehuai, who sat opposite each other, walked around the round table several times to warmly embrace each other. Deputy Prime Minister Peng Dehuai said to Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe: "As long as our two countries trust each other and understand each other, we will always be friends."

In an atmosphere full of peaceful coexistence and friendly unity, the banquet continued until 10:30 p.m. Among the more than 300 guests attending the Burmese Ambassador's banquet today were also Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen and Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Burhan Shahidi, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Ye Jianying and Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian, President of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association Zheng Zhenduo, and Chinese Ambassador to Burma Yao Zhongming.

All members of the Burmese Goodwill Delegation and the Burmese Goodwill Economic Inspection Group attended the banquet.

    吴巴瑞副总理在缅甸大使宴会上宣布
    决心同中国人民并肩保卫和平
    吴觉迎副总理祝贺中缅友谊进一步发展
    新华社13日讯　缅甸联邦副总理吴巴瑞和吴觉迎访问中国期间洋溢在北京的中缅两国友谊，在今晚缅甸驻中国大使吴拉茂举行的盛大宴会上达到了一个新的高峰。
    在今晚缅甸大使为欢迎两位缅甸副总理和他们的夫人而举行的宴会上，吴巴瑞副总理在讲话中一再宣布，缅甸决不参加任何帝国主义的集团、任何军事集团和任何与中华人民共和国相对立的集团，决心要和中国人民并肩保卫世界和平。吴觉迎副总理也一再地祝贺中缅友谊在五项原则的基础上进一步发展和巩固，祝贺整个亚非国家和世界各国的友好相处。他们的讲话不时被响彻全场的掌声打断。吴拉茂大使在宴会开始时也对进一步加强两国友谊表示了深厚的希望。
    整个会场上以不断的热烈掌声欢迎周恩来总理对两国友好的激情祝愿。周总理把这次两位缅甸副总理的同时访问中国看做是两国交往史上一次极不平凡的聚会。他认为，“两位贵宾访问中国的结果，使两国政府和人民的相互了解和信任又大大前进了一步。”
    周总理说：“我们两国之间日益发展的友好关系不仅符合两国人民的利益，而且符合亚非国家团结的利益。国际局势的发展证明，亚非国家的团结是维护世界和平的重要因素之一。我们已经而且将继续用我们的友谊作为榜样，加强亚非国家的团结，加强世界和平的事业，使得制造分裂和挑起战争的企图不能得逞。”
    吴巴瑞副总理在宴会上曾三次即席讲话。他说：“在当前的原子时代，各国只有根据五项原则，和平共处，才能够得到世界和平。”
      “现在，整个世界都要求和平，日益支持五项原则。那些反对和平共处的战争贩子，已逐渐失去人民的支持，将遭到人民的围攻，最后走到灭亡的道路。中缅两国在执行五项原则方面要成为范例。在两国友好方面也要成为范例。”他在讲话中还十分激动地把周恩来总理称为建立缅中友好和创始五项原则的奠基人，祝周总理对世界和平做出更重要的贡献。
    周恩来总理感谢吴巴瑞副总理对他的赞扬。他说，这应归功于全体中国人民，因为，没有人民，我们的国家的领导人是作不出任何事情来的。周恩来总理提议为和平共处五项原则的倡议者，缅甸的吴努总理和印度的尼赫鲁总理的健康，为万隆会议的支持者苏加诺总统的健康，也为吴巴瑞副总理和吴觉迎副总理的身体健康，干杯。
    这时，北京饭店的宴会大厅里，异常地活跃起来，所有的人，缅甸贵宾，中国各方面的人士和各国的使节，都饮尽了自己杯里的茅台酒。
    在宴会上，周总理还向大家宣布了一个好消息：吴巴瑞副总理已经答应明年再来中国，到各地作较长时间的访问。吴巴瑞副总理在随后的致词中，证实了周恩来总理的话。这位缅甸副总理说，他明年要再一次到中国作更长时间的访问，再一次会见他的中国老朋友，并且结识更多的中国新朋友。这时候，全场以经久不息的掌声表示热诚地欢迎吴巴瑞副总理再一次来到中国。
    两位缅甸联邦副总理和周恩来总理、彭德怀、贺龙、陈毅副总理坐在一张宴会桌上。这张桌子成了整个洋溢着无限友情的宴会厅里的中心。对面相坐的两国副总理兼国防部长吴巴瑞和彭德怀，几次绕过圆桌站到一起，热烈拥抱。彭德怀副总理对吴巴瑞副总理说：“只要我们两国互相信任，互相了解，我们就会永远友好。”
    在充满和平共处与友好团结的气氛中，宴会一直进行到夜晚十时半。今天出席缅甸大使宴会的三百多位客人中，还有李济深、陈叔通副委员长，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，国防委员会副主席叶剑英、张治中，外交部副部长张闻天，中缅友好协会会长郑振铎，中国驻缅甸大使姚仲明。
    缅甸友好代表团和缅甸友好经济考察团的全体人员都出席了宴会。
