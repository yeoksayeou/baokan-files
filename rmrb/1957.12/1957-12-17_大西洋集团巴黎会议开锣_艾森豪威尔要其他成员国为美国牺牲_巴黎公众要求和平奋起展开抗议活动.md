Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: Amidst the shifting balance of power between the world's two major camps, the North Atlantic Group Council's high-level meeting opened in Paris on the morning of the 16th, fraught with contradictions. The long-anticipated purpose of the meeting is to address the crisis within this aggressive bloc and to intensify the nuclear arms race.

The Chairman of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Ministerial Meeting, Luxembourg Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Mr. Burke, delivered the opening address. He acknowledged the significant achievements of the Soviet Union in science and technology, as reflected by the launch of artificial satellites. However, he used this as a pretext to urge Western countries to intensify their preparations for war. He stated that the current task of the high-level meeting is to "establish a military force that maintains the West's military advantage, and to adapt the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to current needs in terms of rocket weapons, the selection and production of armaments, and the resulting strategy."

Eisenhower then delivered a speech. He portrayed the great achievements of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp in benefiting humanity as a "challenge" to the North Atlantic nations, arguing that the West could no longer afford to be "complacent" in the current situation. To spur the North Atlantic Group countries to intensify their war preparations, he particularly emphasized the need for them to "work together" and endure "sacrifices." He stated that in the past, countries believed that sovereign nations could "live an independent and selfish national life, without the need for mutual assistance in planning and effort," which he considered a "mistaken concept."

Eisenhower concluded by stating that the North Atlantic nations should strive for "common decision-making, common efforts, and common sacrifices," but he acknowledged that "no task is more difficult than this."

French Prime Minister Gaillard, in his speech, also believed that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should "seek to adapt to the new situation." However, he argued that now is not the time to make final decisions on "adopting new institutions and new procedures."

Following Gaillard's speech, the meeting was adjourned and resumed in a closed session that afternoon.

In the lead-up to the meeting, U.S. President Eisenhower held talks with French Prime Minister Gaillard on the evening of the 15th. It was revealed that the two sides engaged in intense bargaining during these talks. The French side insisted that unless the United States guarantees recognition of France's special status in North Africa and Algeria, France would take "extremely reserved attitude towards assuming obligations" on the unpopular issue of establishing missile bases. However, the U.S. side only expressed "understanding of France's difficulties" and "recognition that France has very important interests in North Africa," while refusing to accept that "France should have veto power in dealing with U.S. relations with Tunisia and Morocco." At the same time, Eisenhower also refused to give France a definite assurance that the United States would no longer ship weapons to Tunisia.

Prior to this meeting, Gaillard also held talks with West German Chancellor Adenauer on the morning of the 15th. According to the Associated Press, "the purpose of this meeting was clearly to strengthen France's bargaining position (with the United States)," and during the meeting, Gaillard and Adenauer "discovered a common ground for opposing the Anglo-American dominance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

British Prime Minister Macmillan had lunch with Adenauer on the 15th and held talks lasting three and a half hours. It was revealed that the issues they discussed included the dispute between West Germany and Britain over the maintenance costs of British troops stationed in West Germany, as well as the issue of establishing missile bases in West Germany.

Meanwhile, despite the various "precautionary" measures and prohibitions taken by the French authorities, the public in Paris stepped forward to express their opposition to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's plans to step up war preparations and to the establishment of American missile bases on French territory.

When Eisenhower arrived at Orly Airport on the 14th, French patriots distributed numerous leaflets along the route from the airport to Eisenhower's residence, condemning the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's war preparations. They also released balloons with various slogans into the air, including "Disarmament," "Long Live Peace," "No Weapons for Adenauer," and so on. Many anti-war slogans were also written on the walls of buildings and bridges in Paris.

The U.S. Embassy in Paris is already under the "protection" of the French police to prevent protests from the French public.

　　大西洋集团巴黎会议开锣
    艾森豪威尔要其他成员国为美国牺牲
    巴黎公众要求和平奋起展开抗议活动
    本报综合报道　据新华社16日讯：在世界两大阵营力量对比发生新转折的形势下，北大西洋集团理事会最高级会议16日上午在矛盾重重中宣布开幕。会议的早经透露的目的，是要应付这个侵略集团的危机和加紧核军备竞赛。
    北大西洋公约组织部长会议主席、卢森堡首相兼外交大臣伯克致开幕词。他一方面承认苏联发射人造卫星所反映的苏联在科学技术方面的巨大成就，另一方面以此为借口鼓吹西方国家要加紧备战。他说，目前最高级会议的任务就是要“建立一个保持西方军事优势的军事力量，并且在火箭武器、选择和生产军备以及随之而来的战略方面使得北大西洋公约组织适应当前的需要。”
    艾森豪威尔接着发表演说。他把苏联和整个社会主义阵营造福人类的伟大成就说成是对北大西洋各国的“挑战”，认为在目前情况下西方不能再有“自满”。为了鞭策北大西洋集团的各国加紧备战，他特别强调要求它们“共同努力”和忍受“牺牲”。他说，过去各国认为凡是主权国家就可以“过一种独立的、自私的国家生活，而不需要在计划和努力方面互助配合”，这是一种“错误的概念”。
    艾森豪威尔最后说，北大西洋各国应当做到“共同决定、共同努力和共同牺牲”，但是他承认，“没有什么任务比这个更困难的了”。
    法国总理盖伊阿在发言中也认为北大西洋公约组织要“设法适应新的形势”。但是他认为，目前并不是对于“采取新的机构和新的程序作出最后决定的时候”。
    在盖伊阿发言后，会议宣布休会，并在当天下午开始举行秘密会议。
    在会议前夕，美国总统艾森豪威尔15日晚间同法国总理盖伊阿进行了会谈。据透露，在这次会谈中双方进行了激烈的讨价还价。法国方面坚持，除非美国保证承认法国在北非和阿尔及利亚的特殊地位，否则，法国在政治上不得人心的建立导弹基地的问题上，“将对承担义务采取极大的保留态度”。但是，美国方面只表示“理解到法国的困难”和“认识到法国在北非有非常重要的利益”，而拒绝接受“在处理美国同突尼斯和摩洛哥之间的关系问题时让法国握有否决权”。同时，艾森豪威尔也拒绝就美国不再运送武器给突尼斯的问题向法国作出肯定的保证。
    在这次会谈以前，盖伊阿还在15日早上同西德总理阿登纳举行了会谈。据美联社说，“这次会谈的目的显然是要加强法国（向美国）讨价还价的地位”，而在会谈中，盖伊阿同阿登纳“发现了反对美英统治北大西洋公约组织的共同基础”。
    英国首相麦克米伦同阿登纳15日共进了午餐和进行了长达三小时半的会谈。据透露，他们讨论的问题包括西德同英国在驻西德英军维持费用问题上的争执以及在西德建立导弹基地的问题。
    另一方面，尽管法国当局采取了各式各样的“戒备”措施和禁令，巴黎的公众还是挺身出来，表示反对北大西洋公约组织会议布置加紧备战的计划，反对在法国领土上设置美国导弹基地。
    当艾森豪威尔14日抵达奥利机场时，法国爱国人士在艾森豪威尔由机场去寓所的路上散发了许多传单，谴责北大西洋公约组织的备战活动。他们还向空中放出了带着各种标语的气球，这些标语包括“裁军”，“和平万岁”，“不要给阿登纳武器”等等。在巴黎建筑物的墙上和桥梁上也写上了许多反对战争的标语。
    巴黎的美国大使馆已经处在法国警察的“保护”之下，以防止法国公众的抗议活动。
