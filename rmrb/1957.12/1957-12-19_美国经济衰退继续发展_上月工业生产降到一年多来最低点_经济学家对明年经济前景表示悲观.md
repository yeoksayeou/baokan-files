Xinhua News Agency, New York, 18th: The U.S. industrial production level in November fell to its lowest point in sixteen months.
    The Federal Reserve System Administration's recently released production index for November was 139 (with the 1947-1949 average as 100), a decrease of three points from October, seven points from November of last year, and eight points from the highest level in U.S. history (December of last year).
    The further decline in the production index reflects the continued development of the recession in the U.S. economy. The steel industry's operating rate has now fallen to 69.4%, the lowest level since December 1954 (excluding the period of the major steelworkers' strike in 1956). Automobile sales are also sluggish. As of December 1, inventories of new and used cars reached over 510,000 vehicles, an increase of 100,000 vehicles compared to a year earlier. Statistics from the oil industry show that despite massive cuts in domestic production, oil is still accumulating. The copper industry has announced reductions in copper mining.
    Rail freight and retail trade have also declined. According to a report from the U.S. Department of Commerce, retail trade volume in November further declined compared to October, with the sales volume of durable consumer goods, household goods, and furniture declining the most.
    With the continuous decline in economic activity, the wave of layoffs is currently sweeping the country, and the number of unemployed is constantly increasing. In October of this year, the number of unemployed in the United States was 2.5 million, an increase of 400,000 compared to the same period last year. By November, the number of unemployed had jumped to 3.2 million.
    American economists and capitalists are pessimistic about the U.S. economic outlook. Some believe that the economic recession will continue to develop in 1958, or at least in the first half of 1958.
    Emerson Schmidt, chief economist of the U.S. Department of Commerce, pointed out at an economic discussion held on the 15th with more than a dozen important representatives from the U.S. business community that the current economic recession is at least as severe as the recessions of 1949 and 1954. He predicted that the gross national product in 1958 would decrease by thirty to fifty billion U.S. dollars, and the entire U.S. economy would not rise in 1958.

　　美国经济衰退继续发展
    上月工业生产降到一年多来最低点
    经济学家对明年经济前景表示悲观
    据新华社18日讯　纽约消息：美国11月份的工业生产水平下降到十六个月来的最低点。
    联邦储备系统管理局最近发表的11月份生产指数是一百三十九（以1947—1949年平均数为一百）比10月份下跌了三点，比去年11月下跌了七点，比美国历史上的最高水平（去年12月）下跌了八点。
    生产指数进一步下跌反映了美国经济中出现的衰退现象在继续发展。钢铁工业开工率现在降低到69.4％，这是1954年12月以来的最低水平（1956年钢铁工人大罢工时期除外）。汽车销售也不景气，到12月1日为止，新旧车的存货达到五十一万多辆，比一年以前增加了十万辆。石油工业的统计表明，尽管大量削减国内的产量，但是石油仍然有积存。冶铜工业宣布减少铜矿的开采。
    铁路货运和零售贸易也有下跌。据美国商务部报告，11月份的零售贸易量比10月份进一步下降，其中以耐用消费品、家庭用品和家具的销售量下降得最多。
    随着经济活动的不断下降，目前解雇工人的浪潮正席卷全国，失业人数不断增加。今年10月份美国的失业人数是二百五十万人，比去年同期增加了四十万人。到11月份，失业人数便一跃而增加到三百二十万人。
    美国经济学家和资本家对美国的经济前景表示悲观，有些人认为，经济衰退将在1958年继续发展，或者至少在1958年上半年要继续发展。
    美国商务部首席经济学家爱默生·施密特15日在美国企业界的十多个重要代表举行的经济讨论会上指出，目前的经济衰退至少同1949年和1954年的衰退一样严重。他预料1958年的国民生产总值会下降三十到五十亿美元，整个美国经济在1958年不会上升。
