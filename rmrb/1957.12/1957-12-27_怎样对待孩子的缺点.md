How to Treat Children's Shortcomings
　　Cong Yinpu

　　Parents all have a common desire: to hope that their children are obedient, sensible, polite, and don't fight, and that they will grow up to be useful people to the motherland. In order to educate their children well, many parents have exhausted all kinds of methods to patiently educate their children and have achieved good results. However, parents' attitudes towards their children are different.

　　One mother described her seven-year-old boy like this, she said: "I can't do anything with this child, Xiaolin, I really want to send him to the police station for labor reform. I get so angry when I mention him that I shiver, I don't give him food to eat, clothes to wear, and even beat him severely, but he's not afraid of anything. When he hits someone and people come to complain, I beat him, and he goes to their house to act like a rogue, lying on their bed, smashing their windows, no one dares to provoke him."

　　Why did Xiaolin become such an unruly and rude child? Who should be responsible for this? Of course, we cannot blame this seven-year-old child. Children have self-esteem from an early age, and they demand that adults treat them in the same way as they treat adults, respecting, loving, and caring for them. If adults are unfair or rude to him, he will feel very uncomfortable and feel injustice in his heart. This will not only cause the child's resentment and resistance, but also allow him to learn the same attitude from the adults' attitude towards him to treat others. Children who are often beaten are always the ones who love to fight among their peers. Xiaolin is also like this. Xiaolin's confrontation with his mother is precisely because his mother beats him, scolds him, gives his younger siblings good food and clothes, but doesn't give them to him. Therefore, the child's actions are often inconsistent with his mother's requests. When others told his mother that Xiaolin was fighting with others again, this mother neither clarified the situation, distinguished right from wrong, nor explained to the child why he shouldn't fight with others, and without asking any questions, she raised her hand to hit him. The child did not understand why he was being beaten, so he developed a strong rebellious psychology. After enduring the physical pain, he ran out to smash other people's windows and lay on other people's beds to act like a rogue, deliberately making his mother angry. The child's psychology is understandable. He repays his mother's rudeness with a rebellious attitude. This creates an adversarial emotion between the mother and the child, even generating mutual hatred, making the child's character rough and unruly.

　　To make children develop the habit of being obedient and respecting their parents, parents must adopt a patient and persuasive attitude towards their children's shortcomings and respect their children's personality. Corporal punishment not only cannot enable children to distinguish right from wrong, but on the contrary, it will cause children to develop a fearful and resistant psychology, reduce the prestige of the educator, and bring great physical and mental pain to the child. Not using corporal punishment on children does not mean giving up educating them, or that there is no need to have strict requirements on children. Of course, children should be educated when they make mistakes, but they should not be humiliated. They should be patiently explained the rationality of adults' demands on him, enlighten the child's self-esteem, and make him feel that he has done something wrong. The kindergarten teacher's attitude towards Xiaolin is different from his mother's. Once, the mother dragged Xiaolin all the way from the river outside the city to the kindergarten, scolding and yelling all the way. The child's shoes and pants were covered in mud, and he struggled, cried, and shouted. When the teacher took him over, took off his shoes and socks, and let him stand on the clean wooden board, Xiaolin stopped crying immediately. The teacher asked him in a gentle tone: "What did you go to the river for?" He said: "I went to catch fish." She asked again: "Did you get any fish?" He widened his eyes and said happily: "Yes, lots of them!" The teacher said: "You like catching fish, but you should tell your mother clearly. Your mother is afraid that you will fall into the river and drown. Look how anxious your mother is, and if you make your mother sick, won't you feel bad? In the future, if you like to do something, tell the adults, and your mother won't be anxious." Later, with the help of the kindergarten teacher, Xiaolin's mother realized her mistake and changed her attitude towards the child. As a result, Xiaolin's behavior at home showed new improvements, not only could he listen to his mother, but he could also help his mother with chores.

　　What do these facts tell us? This shows that children deeply understand how adults treat them, and decide whether or not they are willing to listen to adults.

    怎样对待孩子的缺点
  　丛荫蒲
    做父母的都有一个共同的愿望：希望自己的孩子是一个听话、懂事、有礼貌、不打架的好孩子，长大了能成为对祖国有用的人。为了把孩子教育好，很多做父母的想尽了各种办法耐心地对孩子进行教育，收到了良好的效果。但是，父母对待孩子的态度是不同的。
    有一位妈妈这样叙述自己一个七周岁的男孩子，她说：“小林这孩子我算没办法管，真想把他送到派出所劳动改造去。我一提起他，就气得打哆嗦，我不给他吃饭，不给他穿衣，甚至狠狠地打他，不管怎样他都不怕。他打了人，人家来告状，我打他，他就到人家家里去耍赖，躺在床上，砸碎人家的玻璃，谁都不敢惹他。”
    为什么小林会变成这样一个蛮横粗暴的孩子呢？这究竟要由谁负责呢？当然，我们不能责怪这个七岁的孩子。孩子从小就有自尊心，他们要求成人对待他的态度要和对待大人一样，尊重他、爱他、关心他。如果大人对他不公平或是粗暴，他就会非常难受，心里感到不平。这样，不仅会引起孩子的愤恨和反抗，同时他还会从大人对他的态度中学会了同样的态度去对待别人。经常挨打的孩子，总是在同伴中爱打架的孩子。小林也是这样。小林和妈妈对抗正是因为妈妈打他、骂他，给弟弟妹妹吃好的穿好的而偏偏不给他。所以孩子的行动常常是和妈妈的要求不一致的。当别人来告诉他妈妈小林又和别人打架的时候，这位妈妈既没有弄清情况，分清是非，也没有给孩子讲清楚为什么不应该和别人打架的道理，不问青红皂白举手就打，孩子并不了解为什么挨打，因此产生了强烈的反抗心理，在他忍受了肉体的疼痛以后，跑出去砸碎别人的玻璃，躺到别人床上去撒赖，故意引起母亲生气，孩子的心理是可以理解的。他以反抗的态度回报妈妈对他的粗暴无礼，这样在妈妈和孩子之间就形成对立的情绪，甚至产生了彼此的怀恨心情，使孩子的性格变得粗暴、蛮横。
    要使孩子养成听话和尊重父母的习惯，做父母的必须对孩子的缺点采取耐心说服的态度，尊重孩子的人格。体罚，不但不能使孩子明辨是非，相反的会使孩子产生畏惧和反抗的心理，降低教育者的威信，给孩子身体上、精神上带来莫大的痛苦。不体罚孩子，并不是放弃了对孩子进行教育，或者不需要对孩子有严格的要求。孩子犯了错误，当然要进行教育，但不应当凌辱他们，要耐心地对他们讲解大人对他提出要求的合理性，启发孩子的自尊心，使他自己感到这件事做得不对。幼儿园的老师对待小林的态度，和他妈妈是不同的。有一次，妈妈从城外河里把小林一直拖到幼儿班，连吵带骂。孩子的鞋上裤子上满是泥，他挣扎着大哭大叫。当老师把他接过来，给他脱下了鞋袜让他站在干净的木板上，小林马上不哭了。老师用缓和的口气问他：“你到河里干什么去了？”他说：“摸鱼去了。”又问：“有没有鱼？”他瞪大眼睛愉快地说：“有，多着呢！”老师说：“你喜欢摸鱼，可是应该跟妈妈讲清楚，妈妈怕你掉在河里淹死，你看妈妈多着急，把妈妈急病了你不难受，以后喜欢做什么事告诉大人，妈妈就不着急了。”以后小林的妈妈经过幼儿班老师的帮助，认识到自己的错误，转变了对孩子的态度，于是小林在家庭里的行为有了新的表现，不但能听妈妈的话，还能帮助妈妈做事。
    这些事实告诉我们什么呢？这说明了孩子深刻地体会到大人对他态度如何，而决定他是不是愿意听大人的话。
