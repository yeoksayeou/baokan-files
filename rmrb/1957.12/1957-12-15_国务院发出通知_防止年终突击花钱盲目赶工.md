Xinhua News Agency, December 14th—State Council Notice Regarding Preventing and Correcting the Phenomenon of Year-End Rush Spending and Blind Rush Work.

　　In the past, year-end was often a time when rush spending and blind rush work easily occurred. Some localities and departments, seeing that they could not spend all the money in their budgets, would use various improper methods to rush to spend the money. Some production and capital construction units, seeing that they could not complete their plans, would blindly rush work, causing many losses and wastes to the state. This phenomenon, which violates financial regulations and capital construction management systems, has significantly decreased this year compared to previous years, thanks to the nationwide campaign to increase production and practice economy and the all-people rectification campaign. However, in recent days, the phenomena of rush spending and neglecting project quality have been continuously emerging, which is not permissible. In order to prevent and correct this phenomenon, the State Council stipulates:

　　(1) No agency, organization, enterprise, or institution may use surplus funds in their budgets to rush to purchase unnecessary or non-urgent furniture, equipment, devices, and office supplies, nor may they use disguised forms such as advance payments to spend money ahead of schedule.

　　(2) No capital construction unit may blindly rush or hasten work simply because the capital construction plan cannot be completed, or even falsely report project progress and fraudulently claim project funds. Any capital construction expenditure that has already been resolved with extra-budgetary funds may not be changed to reimbursement from the budget simply because there are surpluses in the budgetary funds.

　　(3) No region, department, or unit may arbitrarily increase wages or promote employees' ranks simply because the originally determined total wage amount for the region, department, or unit has not been used up; nor may they arbitrarily raise welfare standards and increase expenditures simply because there are surpluses in the welfare fund.

　　(4) Financial, banking, and other appropriation supervision agencies and cash management agencies should strengthen the control of year-end appropriations and cash management. State supervisory agencies should pay attention to strengthening supervision and inspection in this area, and pay attention to exposing and correcting phenomena that violate discipline, waste funds, and disregard project quality. People's committees at all levels and the central departments in charge should, in conjunction with the rectification movement, conduct criticism, education, and handling of the aforementioned phenomena that occur in their respective regions and departments, and those with serious cases should be brought to discipline.

　　国务院发出通知
    防止年终突击花钱盲目赶工
    新华社14日讯　国务院关于防止和纠正年终突击花钱盲目赶工现象的通知。
    过去每到年终，就容易发生突击花钱和盲目赶工的现象，有些地方和部门，看到预算上的钱花不完，就用各种不正当的方法赶着把钱花掉，有些生产和基本建设单位看到计划完不成，就盲目的赶工抢工，给国家造成许多损失和浪费。这种违反财政制度和基本建设管理制度的现象，今年在全国开展增产节约运动和全民整风运动的基础上，已经比往年有了显著的减少。但是近几天来，突击花钱、忽视工程质量的现象又在不断地出现，这是不能容许的。为了防止和纠正这种现象，国务院规定：
    （一）无论任何机关、团体、企业、事业单位不得用预算多余的资金，赶着购买不需要或者不急需的家具、器材、设备和办公用品，也不得用预付订货等变相形式提前花钱。
    （二）任何基本建设单位不得因为基本建设计划不能完成，就盲目抢工、赶工，甚至虚报工程进度，冒领工程款项。凡是已经用预算外资金解决了的基本建设支出，不得因为预算内的资金有长余，就改为向预算内报销。
    （三）任何地区、任何部门和单位不得因为本地区、本部门、本单位原定的工资总额没有用完，就随便增加工资，提升职工级别；不得因为福利基金有长余，就随便提高福利标准，增加开支。
    （四）财政、银行等拨款监督机关和现金管理机关，应当加强年终拨款的控制和现金管理。国家监察机关应当注意加强这一方面的监督和检查，注意揭发和纠正违反纪律、浪费资金、不注意工程质量的现象。各级人民委员会和中央各主管部门，对于本地区、本部门发生的上述现象，应当结合整风运动，进行批评、教育和处理，严重者应当绳之以纪律。
                十二月十四日
