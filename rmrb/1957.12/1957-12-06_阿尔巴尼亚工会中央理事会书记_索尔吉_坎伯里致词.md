Dear comrades and friends!

　　The Central Council of Trade Unions of Albania has entrusted me to extend the warmest fraternal greetings to you, the representatives of the Congress, and through you to all the workers of China, and to wish you new achievements in the socialist construction of your motherland.

　　Your Congress is a major event in the world trade union movement, because the Chinese working class is actively fighting for the solidarity of the working class, and for those great goals for which the working class of the world has struggled in the past and is struggling now. The fact that more than 30 delegations from all over the world are participating in this Congress shows that the working classes of all countries are watching China's socialist development with great concern. At the same time, this is a manifestation of our solidarity, a manifestation of the further consolidation of our solidarity, the necessity of which was once again emphasized at the Fourth World Trade Union Congress.

　　We know that our Chinese brothers have achieved great successes under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and we are overjoyed by these achievements, because we regard these achievements as our common achievements. In distant Albania, we feel the enormous strength of China and its spirit of building socialism. We learn from your experience; your work and your achievements inspire us.

　　China and Albania are geographically far apart; our two countries are located at the two poles of the socialist camp. However, such a long distance between us also makes us happy, because it shows that socialist countries have a very vast territory. But it can also be said that we are very close to each other. I am not referring here to the Tu-104 jet, which can shorten this distance. I say we are close because we have common ideas, because we are comrades with the same goals, because we are fighting together for the construction of socialism, for peace, for the unity of the working class, and for social progress. Great friendship has connected our two countries. Both of our countries are members of the great socialist family headed by our great brother, the Soviet Union. We understand that unity is our strength. Not only do we understand this, but our enemies understand it too. Therefore, the strengthening of unity and cooperation between socialist countries and the strengthening of the unity of the world workers' movement terrifies them. Therefore, they try every possible means to undermine this unity. However, the overall situation is not developing according to their logic, their wishes, and their plans. Our unity is unbreakable, our strength is enormous, and our friendly cooperation is being consolidated day by day.

　　Albania recently celebrated the thirteenth anniversary of its liberation. Albania has undergone fundamental changes in this short period. Many foreigners know that Albania is a poor country in the mountains where people wear straw sandals, but it is also a country of brave people who hold weapons. Yes, our people have had to rise up to fight against all kinds of aggressors, and they have taken up swords to pave the way for their history. But the times have changed, and the goals for which the Albanian people took up arms in the past have been achieved. Now, in Albania, people with new aspirations and new prospects have grown up.

　　This new force awakened by our revolution will transform Albania into a country with a strong economy and a cultured country. In these thirteen years, Albania's industrial production has increased fourteen times, agricultural collectivization has been completed, and the people's cultural and material living standards have improved. At the same time, the number of the working class has increased sixfold.

　　Albania is an example and symbol of the fraternal cooperation between socialist countries, and a proof of the selfless assistance given by the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries. Albania proves that when the people of small countries control their own destiny, and when the country is led by a Marxist-Leninist party, they can accomplish great things.

　　Dear friends, please allow me to congratulate you on your achievements in the noble cause of socialist construction and in the struggle for peace and progress. Please allow me to present you with a small gift on behalf of the workers of Albania, as a symbol of our great proletarian friendship.

　　Long live the Chinese working class and the glorious and long-tested Chinese Communist Party!

　　May the unbreakable friendship of the socialist family be increasingly consolidated and prosperous!

　　Long live the unity of the working class of the world!

### 阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会书记　索尔吉·坎伯里致词

　　阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会书记
　　索尔吉·坎伯里致词亲爱的同志们、朋友们！
    阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会委托我代表阿尔巴尼亚工人向你们，代表大会的代表们，并且通过你们向全中国的工人们，致以最热烈的兄弟般的敬礼，预祝你们在自己祖国的社会主义建设中获得新的成就。
    你们的代表大会是世界工会运动中的一件大事，因为中国工人阶级正在积极地为工人阶级的团结，为全世界工人阶级过去和现在所奋斗的那些伟大目标而斗争。来自世界各国的三十多个代表团参加了这次代表大会，这件事情本身说明了各国工人阶级是以极其关怀的心情注视着中国的社会主义的发展。同时，这也是我们团结的一种表现，是我们的团结进一步巩固的表现，这种团结的必要性在世界工会第四次代表大会上曾经再一次被强调地指出过。
    我们知道中国的兄弟们在以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党的领导下获得了巨大的成就，我们为这些成就而感到欢欣鼓舞，因为我们把这些成就看作是我们共同的成就。我们在遥远的阿尔巴尼亚感觉到了中国的巨大力量和它的建设社会主义的气概。我们学习你们的经验；你们的工作和你们的成就鼓舞着我们。
    中国和阿尔巴尼亚在地理上相距很远，我们两国位于社会主义阵营的两极。然而，在我们之间相隔的这样遥远的距离，也同样使我们感到高兴，因为它说明了社会主义国家有着非常辽阔的幅员。但也可以说，我们彼此又离得很近。我这里所说的不是指因为有了能缩短这一距离的图——104喷气式飞机。我说我们离得很近，是因为我们有共同的思想，是因为我们是目标一致的同志，是因为我们共同在为建设社会主义、为争取和平、为工人阶级的团结、为社会的进步而斗争。伟大的友谊已经把我们两国连接在一起。我们两国都是以我们伟大的兄弟苏联为首的社会主义国家大家庭中的成员。我们懂得团结就是我们的力量。关于这一点，不仅我们懂得，就是我们的敌人也懂得。因此，社会主义国家间的团结和合作的加强，世界工人运动的统一的加强，使得他们极端恐惧。所以，他们千方百计地破坏这种团结。然而，整个形势并不是按照他们的逻辑，他们的愿望和他们的计划发展的。我们的团结是牢不可破的，我们的力量是巨大的，我们的友好合作正在日益巩固。
    阿尔巴尼亚不久前庆祝了自己解放十三周年的纪念。阿尔巴尼亚在这短短的时期内已起了根本的变化。很多国外的人都知道，阿尔巴尼亚是一个在山地上、人民脚穿草鞋的贫穷的国家，但是它又是手持武器的勇敢的人民的国家。是的，我国人民曾经不得不起来进行反对各种侵略者的斗争，他们曾经拿起宝剑为自己的历史开辟了道路。但现在的时代已经变了，过去阿尔巴尼亚人民拿起武器进行斗争的目标已经达到了。现在，在阿尔巴尼亚成长了有着新的愿望和新的前途的人们。
    我国革命所唤起的这种新力量，会把阿尔巴尼亚变成为一个具有强大经济的国家，一个有文化的国家。在这十三年中，阿尔巴尼亚的工业生产量增长了十四倍，农业集体化已经完成，人民的文化和物质生活水平提高了。同时，工人阶级的人数增加了六倍。
    阿尔巴尼亚是社会主义国家之间进行兄弟合作的结果的榜样和标志，是苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家给予大公无私的援助的证明。阿尔巴尼亚证明了，当小国家的人民掌握了自己的命运，当这个国家是由马克思列宁主义的政党领导时，他们就能作出伟大的事业。
    亲爱的朋友们，请允许我祝贺你们在社会主义建设的崇高事业中，在争取和平和进步的斗争中获得成就。请允许我代表阿尔巴尼亚的工人赠送给你们一个小小的礼品，作为我们伟大的无产阶级友谊的象征。
    中国工人阶级和光荣的久经考验的中国共产党万岁！
    祝社会主义大家庭的牢不可破的友谊日益巩固和繁荣！
    全世界工人阶级团结万岁！
