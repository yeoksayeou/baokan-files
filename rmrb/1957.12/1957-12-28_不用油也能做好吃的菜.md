It's difficult for many people to cook without oil. However, it is possible to make delicious dishes with little or no oil. Meat shreds, slices, and cubes stir-fried without oil are even more tender than those stir-fried with oil, and fish and shrimp braised without oil are not only soft and tender but also flavorful. Now, here are two methods for braising fish without oil:

    Milky Soup Crucian Carp
    Buy half a pound of live crucian carp and half a pound of Chinese cabbage or four ounces of green radish. Clean the live fish and blanch it in a pot of boiling water until it changes color, then remove. Cut the Chinese cabbage into thin, long pieces (or shred the green radish thinly). Pour two large bowls of water into a pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the fish, along with crushed ginger, and wait for the soup to turn milky white. Then add the Chinese cabbage or radish shreds, cooking wine, and salt, and cook for three to five minutes until done.

    Braised Crucian Carp in Soy Sauce
    Buy one pound of fresh crucian carp, scale, gut, and clean it. Blanch the fish in a pot of boiling water until it changes color, then remove. Then place the wok over low heat and add various seasonings: soy sauce, sweet bean sauce, salt, vinegar, cooking wine, scallions, ginger, sugar, etc. Add a little water and place the fish in the wok. After the fish has taken on color, add more water (the amount of water should not be too much or too little, just enough to almost submerge the fish). Bring to a boil twice over high heat, then simmer over low heat to reduce the sauce, turning the fish over. After two or three minutes, return to high heat to thicken the sauce. The fish prepared this way is as delicious as fish braised with oil.

    不用油也能做好吃的菜
    周华章
    不用油做菜，很多人都感到困难。不过，少用油或不用油也可以做出好吃的菜。不用油炒出来的肉丝、肉片、肉丁比用油炒的还要嫩，不用油烧的鱼、虾不但软嫩而且入味。现在写出两种不用油烧鱼的方法：
    奶汤鲫鱼
    买活鲫鱼半斤、白菜半斤或青萝卜四两。把活鱼收拾后，放在滚开的水锅中一烫，变色后捞出。白菜切成细长块（如用青萝卜则切细丝）。盛两大碗水，放在大火上坐开，把鱼放入，同时放进拍过的姜块，俟汤变成乳白色时，放进白菜或萝卜丝、料酒和盐，煮三、五分钟，就熟了。
    红烧鲫鱼
    买新鲜鲫鱼一斤，去鳞、开膛、洗净，把鱼放入滚水锅中一烫，变色就捞出，然后把炒勺坐在文火上，放入各种作料——酱油、甜面酱、盐、醋、料酒、葱、姜、白糖等，稍加一点水，把鱼放入；等鱼上色后，再加水（水不宜过多，也不能过少，以将要淹到鱼为限），在大火上煮两开后，再放文火上烤汤，并把鱼翻转，二三分钟后，再放到大火上收汤。这样做出的鱼和用油烧的鱼一样好吃。
