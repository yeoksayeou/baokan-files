    One Hundred and Eighty Silver Dollars
    The news that Zhang Luoxin, a "five-guarantee household" in Dacaogzhuang, Ningjin County, Hebei Province, generously invested one hundred and eighty silver dollars to support water conservancy construction caused a sensation in the area dozens of miles around Ningjin County.
    Zhang Luoxin is sixty-six years old, and his wife is fifty-nine years old. From the age of sixteen, when Zhang Luoxin first learned to hoe the ground, he worked desperately to earn money. He couldn't bear to eat or wear good clothes all year round, and he saved the money he earned bit by bit. Even during the great flood of 1917, he ate tree bark, dug wild vegetables, and ate bran cakes, but he couldn't bear to touch the money.
    The old man's money was kept very carefully. He used small urns to hold the money and built them into the adobe wall, never letting anyone know, not even his wife was very clear about it. But now, he happily donated it to the cooperative. Why? Listen to his own explanation:
    "Since our village established the advanced cooperative, my wife and I have become 'five-guarantee households'. The cooperative takes care of us so thoughtfully, sweeping snow when it snows, carrying water when it rains, sending noodles when we have no noodles, and giving us cotton clothes when we have no cotton. Someone takes care of everything.
    "Thinking about the past suffering and looking at the present blessings, we are old, unable to work, but we have food, clothing, shelter, and money to spend. People's hearts are made of flesh, who can not be moved! The cooperative calls for investment in well digging, so tell me, how can we not invest!? What's the use of keeping these dead things! Investing the silver in the cooperative makes me feel even happier. First, my wife and I have shown our hearts and added strength to the cooperative; second, it also lets those who say cooperatives are terrible see that the cooperative members are of one heart with the cooperative."

    一百八十元银洋
    河北省宁晋县大曹庄五保户张洛信老俩口为支持水利建设慷慨投资银洋一百八十元的消息，轰动了宁晋县方圆几十里的地区。
    张洛信现年六十六岁，老伴五十九岁。从十六岁上张洛信刚会锄地起，他就拚命地下地干活赚钱。他一年到头舍不得吃也舍不得穿，把挣得的钱一点一滴地积存起来，就是民国六年大水灾的时候，他吃树皮、挖野菜、吃糠团子，也舍不得动这些钱。
    老头的钱是收藏得很严的，他把钱用小瓮盛着垒在坯墙里，从来不让别人知道，就是连他的老伴也不太清楚。可是，现在他却高高兴兴地献给社里了，为什么呢？听听他自己的解释吧：
    “自从俺村一建立了高级社，俺老俩口子就成了五保户啦。社里照顾俺真周到，下雪扫雪，下雨担水，没面送面，没棉花给衣裳穿，什么都有人管。
    “想想过去的苦，看看现在的福，老了，不能动了，倒有吃、有穿、有住、有钱花。人心是肉的，谁能不感动呢！“社里号召打井投资，你说，咱能不投嘛！？撂着这点死物顶什嘛用！把银子投到社里，我心里更痛快了，一来俺老俩掏出了各人的心，为社里加了一把力；二来也让那些说合作社糟的人看一看社员同社是一条心。”
