Xinhua News Agency, December 17th -- According to preliminary statistics from the National Agricultural Work Conference: This year, the average per-mu grain yield of sixty-five counties and cities has reached the grain production increase targets of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). Among them, twenty-nine counties and cities respectively reached the targets of 400 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin last year, and the other thirty-six counties and cities reached them this year.

　　In areas north of the Yellow River, Qinling Mountains, and Bailong River, nineteen counties and cities have reached and exceeded the 400-jin target this year. They are: Zunhua, Funing, Lulong, Leting, Gaocheng, Zhengding, Xinle, Anguo, Luancheng, Xingtai (city), and Shijiazhuang (city) in Hebei Province; Xi'an (city) in Shaanxi Province; Dunhuang, Zhangye, Linze, and Linxia (city) in Gansu Province; Meng County and Anyang (city) in Henan Province; and Tianjin. Among them, the average per-mu yield of Xi'an City and Anyang City has reached 500 jin and 600 jin respectively.

　　In areas south of the Yellow River and north of the Huai River, Huang County in Shandong has reached the 500-jin target. The average per-mu grain yield of Huang County reached 633 jin last year (this newspaper reported 599 jin in February this year, which included soybeans in the calculation). Although it suffered a rare drought this year, the per-mu yield was still 511 jin.

　　In areas south of the Huai River, Qinling Mountains, and Bailong River, forty-five counties and cities have reached and exceeded the 800-jin target. They are: Chenghai, Chao'an, Jieyang, Chaoyang, Puning, Nan'ao, Raoping, Lianping, Fengshun, Shantou (city), Foshan (city), and Chaozhou (city) in Guangdong Province; Longxi, Haicheng, Changle, Nan'an, Yunxiao, Fuzhou (city), and Zhangzhou (city) in Fujian Province; Cixi, Wenling, Huangyan, and Wenzhou (city) in Zhejiang Province; Anqing (city) in Anhui Province; Xiaogan, Huangpi, Xishui, Macheng, Hong'an, Xinzhou, Yunmeng, Dawu, Guangji, Hanchuan, and Hanyang in Hubei Province; Pixian, Xinfan, Xindu, Wenjiang, Guanghan, Mianzhu, Shuangliu, Neijiang (city), and Chengdu (city) in Sichuan Province; and Yiliang in Yunnan Province. Among them, the average per-mu yield of counties such as Chenghai, Chao'an, Jieyang, Chaoyang, Puning, Nan'ao, and Xiaogan, Pixian has reached or exceeded 1,000 jin. The average per-mu grain yield in the Shantou area of Guangdong Province has also reached 800 jin this year.

　　Cixi, Macheng, Guangji, Dunhuang, and Shijiazhuang, five counties and cities that have respectively reached the grain yield target this year, have also simultaneously reached the target of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

　　In addition, in various provinces and cities, many agricultural production cooperatives have achieved average per-mu grain yields of 400 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin on large areas of high-yield fields. According to very incomplete statistics from the National Agricultural Work Conference, more than 25,700 such agricultural cooperatives have emerged nationwide this year. At the same time, in various regions, the grain output of many counties, cities, and agricultural cooperatives is approaching the requirements of 400 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin this year.

　　Some of the above-mentioned areas that have achieved the grain production targets of the Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule were originally rich and high-yield grain areas, while others were originally barren and low-yield grain areas (such as Lianping County and Zunhua County). Some have better natural conditions, while others have suffered relatively severe natural disasters (such as Xiaogan County, Macheng County, and Huang County). It is only because they have earnestly implemented various effective production increase measures in light of local conditions and waged a tenacious struggle against various disasters and difficulties that they have achieved high yields.

　　农业纲要三项粮食指标  六十五个县市分别达到
    两万多个农业社实现纲要目标
    据新华社17日讯　据全国农业工作会议初步统计：今年已有六十五个县、市的粮食每亩平均产量，分别提前达到了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的粮食增产指标。其中，有二十九个县市去年就分别达到了四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的指标，另外三十六个县市是今年达到的。
    在黄河、秦岭、白龙江以北地区，今年达到和超过四百斤指标的有十九个县市。它们是：河北省的遵化、抚宁、卢龙、乐亭、藁城、正定、新乐、安国、栾城、邢台（市）、石家庄（市）；陕西省的西安（市）；甘肃省的敦煌、张掖、临泽、临夏（市）；河南省的孟县、安阳（市）和天津市。其中西安市和安阳市的每亩平均产量，已经分别达到了五百斤和六百斤。
    在黄河以南、淮河以北地区，达到五百斤指标的是山东的黄县。黄县去年的粮食每亩平均产量就达到了六百三十三斤（本社今年2月间报道为五百九十九斤，是把大豆包括在内计算的），今年虽然遭受了历史上少有的旱灾，每亩产量还有五百一十一斤。
    在淮河、秦岭、白龙江以南地区，达到和超过八百斤指标的有四十五个县市，它们是：广东省的澄海、潮安、揭阳、潮阳、普宁、南澳、饶平、连平、丰顺、汕头（市）、佛山（市）、潮州（市）；福建省的龙溪、海澄、长乐、南安、云霄、福州（市）、漳州（市）；浙江省的慈溪、温岭、黄岩、温州（市）；安徽省的安庆（市）；湖北省的孝感、黄陂、浠水、麻城、红安、新洲、云梦、大悟、广济、汉川、汉阳；四川省的郫县、新繁、新都、温江、广汉、绵竹、双流、内江（市）、成都（市）；云南省的宜良。其中的澄海、潮安、揭阳、潮阳、普宁、南澳、孝感、郫县等县的每亩平均产量，已经达到或超过了一千斤。广东省汕头专区粮食平均每亩产量，今年也达到了八百斤。
    今年粮食每亩产量分别达到指标的慈溪、麻城、广济、敦煌和石家庄五个县市，同时达到了亩产皮棉百斤的指标。
    另外，各省、市都有不少农业生产合作社的大面积丰产田的粮食平均亩产量分别达到了四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的要求。据全国农业工作会议极不完全的统计，这样的农业社全国今年已出现了两万五千七百多个；同时，各地还有不少县、市和农业社的粮食产量，今年已经分别接近了四百斤、五百斤和八百斤的要求。
    上述提前实现农业发展纲要（修正草案）粮食生产指标的地区，有些原来就是富饶高产粮区，有些原来却是贫瘠的低产粮区（如连平县、遵化县等），有些自然条件较好，有些却遭受了比较严重的自然灾害（如孝感县、麻城县、黄县等），只是由于他们针对本地特点，认真地贯彻了各项有效的增产措施，与各种灾害、困难进行了顽强的斗争，才获得了高额丰产。
