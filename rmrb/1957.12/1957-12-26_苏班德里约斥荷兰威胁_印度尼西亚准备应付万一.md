Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 25th. Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio, on December 24th, commented on the report made by Dutch Foreign Minister Luns in the Dutch Parliament, saying that if the door to negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands is tightly closed, the Indonesian government needs to make appropriate preparations to deal with all possibilities.

He said that the Indonesian government does not solely rely on negotiations to resolve the dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands.

As previously reported, Luns, on the 23rd in the Dutch Parliament, slandered Indonesia's actions to recover West Irian and threatened that the basis for negotiations between the Netherlands and Indonesia "has become very narrow."

    苏班德里约斥荷兰威胁
    印度尼西亚准备应付万一
    新华社雅加达25日电　印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德约12月24日就荷兰外交大臣伦斯在荷兰议会所作的报告发表谈话说，如果在印度尼西亚和荷兰之间举行谈判的门被严密地关闭，印度尼西亚政府需要作适当的准备来应付一切可能性。
    他说，印度尼西亚政府并不单纯依靠谈判来解决印度尼西亚同荷兰的争执。
    前已报道，伦斯23日在荷兰议会上曾经污蔑印度尼西亚为收复西伊里安而采取的行动，并且威胁地说，荷兰同印度尼西亚进行谈判的基础“已经变得非常狭窄了”。
