    To the Preparatory Committee of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference in Cairo:
    Representatives of people from all circles in the capital of China solemnly held a meeting in Beijing on December 14 to support the Asian-African Solidarity Conference.
    The Chinese people express their heartfelt support and warm congratulations to the Asian-African Solidarity Conference which is about to be held in Cairo, the capital of Egypt. This conference is being held at a time when the Asian and African people have achieved significant victories in their struggle for national independence and in defense of world peace, and it will be a grand gathering of Asian and African countries to strengthen peace, friendship and unity against colonialism.
    We firmly believe that this conference will, on the basis of the Bandung Spirit and the Five Principles, further promote closer unity and cooperation among the Asian and African people, and will join hands with the people of the world to make new contributions to opposing colonialism and safeguarding national independence, to enhancing friendly relations between the Asian and African countries and the countries of the world, and to striving for lasting world peace.
    We wish the conference a complete success!
