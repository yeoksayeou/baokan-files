Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: Following the French authorities' unreasonable order to shut down the "Overseas Chinese Masses" newspaper, published by our compatriots in Paris, on August 30th, they illegally arrested the newspaper's editor on September 13th. It is now learned that the French police recently, under the order of the French Ministry of Interior, have expelled Shen Yun-san, a Chinese student in France and former editor of the "Overseas Chinese Masses" newspaper, ordering Shen to leave French territory by the end of this year. The French authorities' disregard for public condemnation and continued adoption of such unreasonable measures, which are detrimental to the friendship between the Chinese and French people, have aroused great public indignation and are being closely watched.

    法当局不顾舆论谴责
    非法驱逐“侨众”报编辑
    新华社30日讯　继8月30日法国当局无理勒令我国侨胞在巴黎出版的“侨众”报停刊后，9月13日又非法拘捕该报编辑人。现悉法国警局最近又奉法国内政部令，驱逐我留法学生、原“侨众”报编辑沈云三，限本年底令沈离开法国境。法国当局不顾舆论谴责，继续采取这种有损中、法两国人民友谊的无理措施，已引起公众极大愤慨并予密切注视。
