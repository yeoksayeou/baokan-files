　　Revolutionary Mother, Frugality Model
　　Tian Qing, Huan Xin
　　On November 5th, in Zengjia Agricultural Cooperative, Baisha Township, Ji'an County, Jiangxi Province, an eighty-year-old white-haired woman was invited to attend the provincial representative conference of workers' family members as a model of diligence and thrift. This old woman is Mother Kang Xiuyu, the mother of Comrade Zeng Shan, a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
    Although this old woman is already eighty years old, she is still busy in the agricultural cooperative every day watering vegetables, picking mung beans, and mending old clothes. Speaking of which, there is an interesting story. As early as November 1949, at the beginning of the nationwide liberation, when Comrade Zeng Shan was still working in Shanghai, he tried to bring his mother to Shanghai for a reunion. However, after spending only a New Year's Day and Spring Festival with her son in Shanghai, the old woman began to miss the countryside again. She said, "Everyone is so busy, and I'm the only one idle. That won't do!" Comrade Zeng Shan tried to persuade her to stay a few more days, but she said, "Your eldest sister-in-law and third sister-in-law will be busy with spring plowing and silkworm raising. I can go back and help!" She insisted on returning to the countryside. The old woman's frugality and thrift have been going on for more than just a day or two. As early as around the time of the Red Army's Long March, many people in the old woman's family had joined the revolution. Her mother-in-law, husband, eldest son, third son, and second daughter-in-law were all killed, forced to death, or fatally injured by the reactionaries because of the revolution. One of the houses they lived in was also burned down. At that time, due to the persecution by the reactionaries, the family's situation was very difficult. After covering Comrade Zeng Shan's escape, the old woman was imprisoned five times and extorted nearly two thousand silver dollars in "fines" by the Kuomintang reactionary government, which truly led to the family's ruin and heavy debt. The family (besides her and two daughters-in-law, there were also five grandchildren) relied on the eldest daughter-in-law's long-term labor and firewood gathering, and the third daughter-in-law's needlework and silkworm raising to survive. Each person could only eat six or seven taels of rice per day, and every meal consisted only of vegetable leaves and no rice. They had no quilts. Comrades sent them two old cotton quilts, but one was snatched away by the Kuomintang army. At that time, she and her two daughters-in-law relied on each other to survive these difficult years. One year during the Spring Festival, the whole family killed a chicken. The third daughter-in-law saved two chicken legs for the old woman to eat, but the old woman thought that the eldest daughter-in-law had suffered from malaria for a long time and was in poor health, so she gave them to the eldest daughter-in-law. The eldest daughter-in-law saw that the third sister-in-law was also sick and thin, so she gave them to the third sister-in-law. The third sister-in-law couldn't eat them, so they passed them around in a circle, and finally, the whole family gathered around the stove and ate the chicken together. It was by living such a frugal life that they survived the difficult years of the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War.
    In the years of victory, the old woman did not diminish her thrifty nature in the slightest. In the cooperative, she came up with many ways to develop agricultural and sideline production (especially household sideline production). By last year, the number of pigs raised in their home had increased from two to four, and the number of chickens had increased from twenty to more than thirty. The gardens in front and behind the house were also planted with vegetables and melons. Silkworms were a sideline that they had been engaged in for many years and had always persisted in. Now, in her family, in addition to the eldest daughter-in-law and an adopted granddaughter (her five grandchildren died one after another in the days of displacement) participating in cooperative labor and earning 163 yuan (including subsidies for family members of revolutionary martyrs), sideline income is a large item. They can earn 246 yuan a year just from selling pork, eggs, vegetables, and silk. Added to this year's purchase of a sow and a female rabbit to breed piglets and rabbits, the income is even greater. By October alone, the income had already exceeded last year by 100 yuan.
    In June of last year, the eldest sister-in-law heard that raising rabbits was very profitable, so she discussed buying a pair of rabbits to raise with the old woman. But after a few days, one was bitten to death by a dog. After pairing it with another, it was bitten to death by a dog again a few days later. At this time, everyone's enthusiasm for raising rabbits cooled down by half, but the old woman was not discouraged at all. At the family meeting, she calculated the accounts for everyone, saying that there were several benefits to raising rabbits: first, they don't eat grain; second, they save effort; third, they can give birth to four or five litters a year, with at least four or five in each litter, so the development prospects are great; fourth, rabbit fur can also be sold for money. In this way, everyone's enthusiasm for raising rabbits was encouraged again.
    In addition to this, the old woman is also a master at saving grain and cotton cloth. When it comes to improving living standards, she never forgets the level of the past difficult years. During this year's great debate on the grain issue, some people shouted that there was not enough grain to eat, so the old woman used her own experiences to debate with those people. The old woman often used the motto "think of the difficulty of getting every grain of rice" to educate her two daughters-in-law. Under her supervision and encouragement, they came up with many ways to mix coarse grains and vegetables to make food.
    Last year, her family's 126 feet of cloth coupons were only used for 63 feet, mainly for making clothes for the two daughters-in-law and adopted granddaughter. As soon as this year's cloth coupons were issued, the young adopted granddaughter, Mingfeng, clamored for the third sister-in-law to make her a flowered dress. The third sister-in-law said, "Go ask grandma!" When Little Mingfeng found the old woman, the old woman stroked Little Mingfeng's head, smiling and saying, "We'll make it next year. None of us will make any clothes. We'll save the money to repair the house. Do you want to live there?" Mingfeng said, "Yes, but my clothes are torn." The old woman quickly said, "That's easy, I'll mend them for you." This wasn't just talk. The old woman had good eyesight and could thread a needle without wearing glasses. She often mended clothes for her adopted granddaughter, and sometimes helped her daughters-in-law with some needlework so they could be busy with the cooperative's affairs. As for her own shoes, socks, and clothes, they were always neatly mended. A few years ago, Comrade Zeng Shan gave her two pairs of socks. She only took out one pair to wear on holidays and wore the old ones on weekdays. After wearing them for a few years, she only wore out one pair. Now, that other pair of new socks is still there.

　　革命母亲　勤俭模范
　　田青　焕新
  11月5日，江西省吉安县白沙乡曾家农业社里，有一位八十岁的白发老太太，作为勤俭持家的模范，被邀请出席了省职工家属代表大会。这位老太太就是中共中央委员曾山同志的母亲康秀玉老太太。
    这位老太太现在虽然已是八十岁的高龄了，在农业社里，每天还忙着浇菜蔬、拣绿豆、缝补旧衣。说起来，还有这样一段有趣的事。早在1949年11月，全国解放之初，当曾山同志还在上海工作的时候，曾山同志就曾想办法来接老太太到上海去团聚，但是，老太太在到上海才与儿子共度了一个元旦和春节，就又记挂起农村来了。她说：“大家都很忙，就是我一个人闲着，不行！”曾山同志便劝他多住几天，但她说：“你老大嫂和老三嫂就要忙春耕、养蚕了，我回去还可以帮个忙哩！”她坚持着又回到了农村。老太太过日子克勤克俭，已非一朝一日。早在红军长征前后，老太太家里已有很多人参加了革命，她的婆婆、丈夫、大儿子、三儿子和二媳妇都是因革命被反动派杀害、逼死或伤重致命的，住的房子也被烧了一栋，当时由于反动派的迫害，家庭的境遇是非常困难的。老太太在掩护曾山同志脱险以后，先后坐了五次监狱，被国民党反动政府敲榨了近两千元银洋的“罚款”，真是弄得倾家荡产、负债累累。一家人（除了她和两个媳妇外，还有五个孙儿孙女）就靠大媳妇做长工、砍柴，三媳妇做针线、养蚕来维持。每人每天只能吃上六、七两米，餐餐只见菜叶不见饭；没有被盖，同志们给他们送来两床旧棉絮，还被国民党军队抢走一床。当时，她和两个媳妇几乎是相依为命地撑持着度过了这个艰难的岁月。有一年过春节，全家杀了一只鸡，三媳妇把两个鸡腿留下来送给老太太吃，老太太想到大媳妇打了很久疟疾，身体不好，便又让给大媳妇吃，大媳妇看到老三嫂也病瘦了，便又让给老三嫂吃，老三嫂那里吃得下，传了一个圈圈，最后，还是全家大小一齐围在灶边吃掉了这只鸡。就是靠这样克勤克俭地过日子，她们度过抗日战争和解放战争中的艰苦岁月。
    在胜利的岁月里，老太太仍不稍减她那勤俭的本性。在社里，她对发展农副业生产（特别是家庭副业生产）想了很多办法。到去年，她们家里养猪已由两头增加到四头，鸡也由二十只增加到三十多只；屋前屋后的园子里，也都种满了蔬菜、瓜果；桑蚕更是她们搞了多年而一直坚持着的副业。现在，她家里除大媳妇和一个养孙女（她的五个孙儿、孙女都在颠沛流离的日子里先后死去）参加社里劳动，收入一百六十三元（包括烈属补助工在内）外，副业是很大一项收入，每年仅卖出猪肉、鸡蛋、小菜、蚕丝就可收入二百四十六元。加上今年买了一头母猪、一只母兔来繁殖小猪、小兔，收入就更多了，仅仅到10月，收入就已超过去年一百元。
    去年6月间，老大嫂听说养兔的出息大，便和老太太商量了买一对兔来养。可是不几天就被狗咬死一只，配上一只，过几天，又被狗咬死了。这时，大家养兔的心肠都冷了半截，可是，老太太一点也不灰心。在家庭会上，她给大家算账，说养兔有几大好处：第一、不吃粮食；第二、省功夫；第三、每年可生四、五窝，每窝至少有四、五只，发展前途大；第四、兔毛也可以卖钱。这样，大家养兔的劲头又被鼓动起来。
    除此之外，老太太还是节约粮食、节约棉布的能手。对改善生活，她从不忘记过去艰苦岁月的水平。在今年的粮食问题大辩论中，有人叫喊粮食不够吃，老太太便用自己经过的事情同那些人展开辩论。老太太常以“一粥一饭当思来处不易”的格言来教育两个媳妇，在她的督促和鼓励下，她们想出很多掺合杂粮和菜类做饭的方法。
    去年她们全家的一百二十六尺布票，却只用了六十三尺，主要是给两个媳妇和养孙女做衣服。今年的布票一发下来，小养孙女明风又吵着要老三嫂给做花衣服，老三嫂说：“你去问婆婆吧！”当小明风找到老太太时，老太太抚着小明风的头边笑边说：“明年做吧，我们大家都不做，把钱积起来修理房子，你住不住？”明风说：“住，可是我的衣服破了。”老太太连忙说：“这还不容易，我来给你补”。这不是说着玩的，老太太的眼力好，不用戴眼镜可以穿花针，她确实常给养孙女缝缝补补的，有时还帮着媳妇料理一些针线，让她们去忙社里的事。至于她自己的鞋、袜、衣服更是经常补得整整齐齐的。前几年，曾山同志送给她两双袜子，她只是在节日里拿出一双来穿一穿，平时都穿旧的。穿了几年，只穿旧了一双，现在，她那另一双新袜子，还仍然在那里放着。
