Xinhua News Agency, December 7th:  Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun said at the meeting of the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions this afternoon that after three Five-Year Plans, or a little longer, China will be built into a strong socialist country, and when the fourth Five-Year Plan is further completed, China may catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products. He also pointed out that in the output of industrial products such as coal, machine tools, cement, and chemical fertilizers, China will definitely be able to surpass Britain's level in fifteen years.

Li Fuchun pointed out that changing China's industry from its current situation of lagging far behind Britain to catching up with or surpassing Britain in fifteen years is a great, glorious, and extremely arduous task for the Chinese working class and all the people. After analyzing in detail the possibility of China rapidly building a strong socialist country and catching up with or surpassing Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years, he said that although we will still encounter difficulties, as long as we mobilize all positive factors, utilize all favorable conditions, tap all potential forces, and adhere to the principle of building the country through diligence and frugality, we will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties.

Li Fuchun's report to the conference was titled "On the Achievements of China's First Five-Year Plan and the Tasks and Policies of Socialist Construction in the Future." In this report, he explained in detail the enormous development of China's entire national economy during the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan and the tasks and policies of socialist construction in the future.

Li Fuchun said that relying on the efforts of the working class and the entire people of the country, China's First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy has been completed and overfulfilled. During the First Five-Year Plan period, China has not only established a socialist political and economic system but has also established the initial foundation for socialist industrialization. However, he pointed out that China has not yet been built into a socialist country and is still in a period of transition. We are still facing the serious task of further consolidating and developing socialism economically, politically, and ideologically, namely, the task of building China into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

Li Fuchun said that to achieve this task, in addition to carrying the socialist revolution through to the end and achieving the complete victory of socialism over capitalism, the main task in socialist construction is to build a basically complete industrial system in China, complete the National Agricultural Development Program, and complete the long-term plan for scientific development. The development of the national economy during the Second Five-Year Plan should implement the policy proposed by the Party Central Committee of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously, on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry. This is the correct path to realize China's socialist industrialization.

Li Fuchun said in the last part of his report that we have already achieved the victory of the First Five-Year Plan, and on the basis of this victory, and on the basis of the victory of the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, a new upsurge of socialist construction of a more magnificent scale is forming. We believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese working class will certainly be able to unite the people of the whole country to undertake the new and arduous task of socialist construction, and will certainly be able to victoriously build China into a great, prosperous, and strong socialist country.

Before Li Fuchun gave his report, five representatives spoke at the conference this afternoon.

Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said in his speech at the conference that the tasks of China's trade unions in future international activities are enormous. China's trade unions must, in accordance with the resolutions passed by this conference, use all favorable factors, unite all forces that can be united, work hard, and strive to promote the unity and solidarity of trade unions.

Jiang Tao (Director of the Labor Protection Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions) pointed out in his speech that in order to effectively implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee that "trade union organizations should organize the masses to supervise and assist the administration in doing a good job in labor protection," trade union organizations at all levels should combine the rectification movement, strive to overcome shortcomings in their work, continue to strengthen ideological and organizational construction of mass labor protection work, and assist enterprise administrations in strengthening regular accident prevention work. At the same time, it is necessary to mobilize various social forces to jointly study and solve several key issues in safety production.

Zhang Tianmin (Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Construction Trade Union) said in his speech that in launching socialist competitions among employees, the construction trade union organizations at all levels must educate employees to comprehensively implement the policy of achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results, and greet the Second Five-Year Economic Construction Plan with a hundredfold confidence, and usher in a great new upsurge in production and construction.

Yang Fuzhen (weaving worker at the State-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory) reported in her speech on her achievements in completing production plans on a monthly basis during the First Five-Year Plan, and introduced the experience of her trade union group.

Wang Jiong (Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions) expressed his opinions on the issue of the mass line in trade union work based on some situations in the enterprise rectification in Beijing. Wang Jiong emphasized that in the daily activities of the trade union, employees should be widely attracted to directly participate in certain affairs of the trade union and make decisions on issues, so that the solution of problems has a stronger mass base.

Today's conference ended at 5:30 p.m. There will be a recess tomorrow.

    第一个五年计划胜利完成
    十五年赶上英国工业水平
    李富春在工会代表大会上谈我国建设的成就和远景
    据新华社7日讯　国务院副总理李富春在中国工会第八次全国代表大会今天下午举行的会议上说，经过三个五年计划或者更多一点的时间把我国建成一个社会主义强国，并且进一步完成第四个五年计划的时候，我国就有可能在钢铁和其它重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国。他并且指出，在煤炭、机床、水泥、化学肥料等工业品的产量方面，十五年后我国肯定能够超过英国的水平。
    李富春指出，在十五年后把我国的工业从现在远远落后于英国的状况改变为赶上或超过英国的状况，这是我国工人阶级和全体人民一个伟大的光荣的和十分艰巨的任务。他在详细分析了我国能够迅速建成社会主义强国和十五年后在钢铁和其他重要工业产品产量方面赶上或超过英国的可能性以后说，虽然我们还会遇到困难，但是只要我们动员一切积极的因素，利用一切有利的条件，发掘一切潜在的力量，坚持勤俭建国的方针，我们就一定能够战胜一切困难。
    李富春向大会作的报告，题目是“关于我国第一个五年计划的成就和今后社会主义建设的任务、方针”。他在这个报告中详细说明了我国在执行第一个五年计划中整个国民经济的巨大发展和今后社会主义建设的任务和方针。
    李富春说，依靠全国工人阶级和全体人民的努力，我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划已经完成和超额完成。在第一个五年计划期间，我国不但已经确立了社会主义的政治制度和经济制度，同时建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础。但是他指出，我国还没有建成社会主义，还处在过渡时期，我们还面临着从经济上和从政治上、思想上进一步巩固和发展社会主义的严重任务，即把我国建设成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国的任务。
    李富春说，实现这个任务，除了必须把社会主义革命进行到底，取得社会主义对资本主义的彻底胜利以外，在社会主义建设方面，主要的就是要在我国建成一个基本上完整的工业体系，完成全国农业发展纲要，完成科学发展的远景规划。在第二个五年计划期间国民经济的发展，应当贯彻执行党中央提出的在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，这是实现我国社会主义工业化的正确道路。
    李富春在报告最后说，我们已经取得了第一个五年计划的胜利，在这个胜利的基础上，在全民整风和反右派斗争的胜利的基础上，一个规模更加壮阔的社会主义建设的新的高潮正在形成。我们相信，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，我国工人阶级一定能够团结全国人民担当起新的艰巨的社会主义建设任务，也一定能够胜利地把我国建成一个伟大的富强的社会主义国家。
    李富春作报告以前，有五位代表在今天下午的大会上发言。
    中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜在大会的发言中说，我国工会今后国际活动的任务是巨大的，我国工会必须根据这次大会所通过的决议，利用一切有利的因素，团结一切可以团结的力量，努力工作，为促进工会的统一团结而斗争。
    江涛（全国总工会劳动保护部部长）代表在发言中指出，为了切实执行党中央提出的“工会组织应当组织群众监督协助行政做好劳动保护工作”的指示，工会各级组织应结合整风运动，努力克服工作中的缺点，继续加强群众劳动保护工作的思想建设和组织建设，协助企业行政加强经常性的预防事故工作。同时要动员各种社会力量，共同研究和解决几个安全生产方面的关键问题。
    张天民（中国建筑工会全国委员会主席）代表在发言中说，建筑工会各级组织在发动职工开展社会主义竞赛中，必须教育职工全面贯彻执行又多又快又好又省的方针，以百倍的信心，迎接第二个五年经济建设计划，掀起一个伟大的生产建设新高潮。
    杨富珍（国营上海第一棉纺织厂织布工人）代表在发言中，报告了她在第一个五年计划中按月完成生产计划的成绩，并且介绍了她所在的工会小组工作的经验。
    王炯（北京市工会联合会主席）代表根据北京市企业整风中的一些情况，就工会工作的群众路线问题，发表了意见。王炯强调说，在工会的日常活动中，应该广泛吸引职工群众直接参与工会的某些事务，决定问题，使问题的解决更具有群众基础。
    今天的大会在下午五时三十分结束。明天休会一天。
