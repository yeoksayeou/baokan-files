    When Beijing Enters 1958

    On New Year's Eve, people often like to stay by the radio, waiting for the New Year's bell, and then everyone congratulates each other. But have you ever thought about whether all parts of the world enter the New Year at the same moment? Maybe you'll say that since we're all on the same planet, of course we should celebrate the New Year at the same time. However, that's not the case. When we in Beijing hear the New Year's bell, it's still just New Year's Eve in Moscow, and even later in Greenwich, England. This is a truly fascinating question.

    In our lives, there's also this: no matter how accurate your watch is, if you take a train from Beijing to Moscow, you'll find that the time on your watch differs from Moscow time by five hours. In newspapers and on the radio, we often see or hear "Beijing Time," "Moscow Time," and so on. These things seem a bit complicated, but the principle is very simple.

    Before the invention of clocks, our ancestors used sundials to calculate time. When the shadow on the sundial pointed directly north, it was noon. In terms of clock time, that would be twelve o'clock. The Earth is constantly rotating from west to east, so noon comes earlier in places east of the Earth than in places west. For example, when the sun is directly south of Beijing, it's noon in Beijing. But if it's noon in Beijing, the sun hasn't reached the south in Xi'an yet. This kind of time, determined solely by the relationship between the sun and one's own location, is called local time. Beijing has Beijing's local time, and Shanghai has Shanghai's local time.

    A long time ago, many large cities in the world had their own time. At that time, there wasn't much political, economic, or cultural exchange between them, so people didn't feel any inconvenience. However, with the development of society, the difficulties caused by the different times used in different places became increasingly apparent. For example, if you take a train from Shanghai to Xi'an, you have to adjust your watch according to the local time every time the train travels a certain distance. How troublesome!

    People use time zones to solve this problem. We divide the Earth into 360 equal parts according to the circumference, and each part is called one degree of longitude. According to general practice, the international line passing through the Greenwich Observatory in England is called zero degrees, and it is divided into 180 degrees east and west. The Earth rotates once every twenty-four hours, which means that every degree of longitude difference is a four-minute difference; every fifteen degrees of longitude difference is a one-hour difference. People divide the 360 degrees into twenty-four equal parts, which are the current twenty-four time zones. The area from 7.5 degrees west to 7.5 degrees east of Greenwich, England, is the starting point of the time zone, called the central zone. Then, west and east, starting from 7.5 degrees, every fifteen degrees is considered a time zone. In addition to the central zone, there are East Zone 1, East Zone 2, up to East Zone 12; West Zone 1, West Zone 2, up to West Zone 12 (in fact, East Zone 12 is also West Zone 12). It is also stipulated that within the same time zone, the time of the middle of the time zone is used as the standard time.

    This is really much more convenient. No matter where you go, as long as you don't leave the time zone you're in, you don't need to adjust your watch. You only need to adjust your watch when you cross a time zone, and it's just a one-hour adjustment. Because adjacent time zones are one hour apart in time. If you go from here to another time zone to the east, you have to set your watch forward one hour; if you go to an adjacent time zone to the west, you have to set your watch back one hour.

    Standard time is calculated from the meridian passing through the Greenwich Observatory in England. China is east of Greenwich. According to the calculation of one time zone every fifteen degrees, the central and coastal areas of our country belong to East Zone 8. And our East Zone 8 uses the local time of 120 degrees east longitude as the standard time. Because the time used in Beijing is the time of 120 degrees east longitude, for the sake of convenience, we call it "Beijing Time." This is the time commonly used in vast areas of the country (except Xinjiang and Tibet). However, "Beijing Time" is not the true local time of Beijing, because Beijing's geographical location is 116 degrees and 22 minutes, so the Beijing Time currently used nationwide differs from the true local time of Beijing by 14 minutes and 24 seconds.

    Once you understand what "Beijing Time" is, "Moscow Time," "Pyongyang Time," and "Greenwich Time" are also easy to understand. Why different parts of the world do not enter the New Year at the same time naturally ceases to be a problem.

    Moscow is in East Zone 2, so in theory it should be six hours slower than Beijing time. However, since 1930, the Soviet government, in order to cultivate the habit of early rising among the people, has generally advanced clocks by one hour, so in fact Moscow time is now five hours behind Beijing time. When it is noon in Moscow, it is already 5 p.m. here.

    Pyongyang is to our east, belonging to East Zone 9, and they use the local time on 135 degrees east longitude as the standard time. Because it is our neighboring zone to the east, it is only one hour different, when it is noon here, it is exactly 1 p.m. there.

    Because international radio and air traffic are becoming increasingly developed, there must be a global standard time, which is "World Time." Usually, Greenwich Time is considered the world's standard time. Greenwich and we are eight time zones apart, so naturally there is an eight-hour difference in time. 8 p.m. in Greenwich is exactly equivalent to 4 a.m. here before dawn.

### 当北京进入一九五八年的时候

    当北京进入一九五八年的时候
    除夕这天夜里，人们常常喜欢守在收音机旁边，等着新的一年的钟声，然后，大家互相祝贺一番。可是你想过没有，是不是世界各地全是在这一个时刻里进入新的一年里呢？也许你会说，既然同在这个地球上，当然要同时过年了。但是，事实不是这样。当我们在北京听到新年的钟声的时候，在莫斯科还不过是大年除夕，在英国格林威治更要晚的多，这实在是个饶有趣味的问题。
    在我们的生活中，还有这样的事：不论你的表有多准，要是从北京坐火车到莫斯科，你就会发现，自己的表上的时间和莫斯科的时间差了五小时。在报纸上、广播里也常常看到或听到“北京时间”，“莫斯科时间”等等。这些，看起来有些复杂，其实道理很简单。
    在钟表发明以前，我们的祖先是用日晷（日规）来计算时间的。日晷上的影子正指向北面的时候，就是正午。要是说钟表上的时间，就是十二点。地球在一刻不停地从西向东旋转着，所以在地球上东面的地方的正午，就比西面地方的正午来得早些。譬如太阳在北京的正南方的时候，北京就是正午了。可是如果这时候在西安，太阳还没有到正南呢。这种只以太阳和自己地方的关系来定出的时间，就叫地方时间。北京有北京的地方时间，上海有上海的地方时间。
    很早以前，世界上很多大城市都有自己的时间。这在当时，彼此间在政治、经济、文化上的往来还不多，人们倒也没感到有什么不方便。然而，随着社会的发展，由于各地使用的时间互不相同所引起的困难就越来越显著了。比方说，你从上海乘火车到西安，火车每跑一段路程，你就要按照当地的时间来校正一下自己的表。这有多么麻烦！
    人们用划分时区的办法，来解决这个麻烦。我们按照圆周把地球分成了三百六十等分，每一等分就叫经度一度。根据一般的习惯，把通过英国格林威治天文台的国际线叫做零度，向东向西各分成一百八十度。地球每转一周需要二十四小时，这就是说，每差经度一度，就要差四分钟；每差经度十五度，就要差一小时。人们把三百六十度平分成二十四个等分，这就是现在的二十四个时区。从英国格林威治向东向西各七度半的区域是时区的起点，叫做中区。然后，向西向东即再从七度半的地方算起，每隔十五度的地区就算做一个时区。除中区而外，就是东一区、东二区，直到东十二区；西一区、西二区、直到西十二区（实际上，东十二区，也就是西十二区）。并且规定，在同一时区里，都以本时区中间地方的时间做为标准时间。
    这样一来，实在是方便多了。不论是走到哪里，只要不出你所在的这个时区，就用不着再对表了。只有在跨过时区的时候，对一下表就可以了，而且一拨就是一小时。因为相邻的时区，在时间上都是相差一小时。如果从我们这儿到东面的另一时区去的时候，要把表拨快一小时；若是到西面相邻的时区，就要把表拨慢一小时。
    标准时间是以通过英国格林威治天文台的经线算起的。我们中国在格林威治东面。按每隔十五度为一时区计算，我国中部及沿海地区都属于东八区。而我们这个东八区，是以东经一百二十度的地方时间为标准时间。因为北京所用的时间是东经一百二十度的时间，为了称呼方便，我们就叫它“北京时间”。这就是全国广大地区（新疆、西藏除外）所通用的时间。不过，“北京时间”并非是真正的北京的地方时间，因为北京的地理位置是一百一十六度二十二分，因而现在全国通用的北京时间和真正的北京的地方时间还相差十四分二十四秒。
    弄清了什么叫做“北京时间”以后。“莫斯科时间”，“平壤时间”，“格林威治时间”也就好理解了。为什么世界各地不是在同一个时间里进入新的一年自然也就不成什么问题了。
    莫斯科在东二区，照理应比北京时间慢六小时。但自1930年起，苏联政府为着养成人民早起的习惯，普遍将时钟拨快一小时，因此实际上现在莫斯科时间比北京时间晚五小时。当莫斯科中午的时候，我们这里已经是下午五点钟了。
    平壤在我们东面，属东九区，那儿把东经一百三十五度上的地方时间做为标准时间。因为是我们东面的邻区，所以只相差一小时，我们这儿中午的时候，他们那儿正好是下午一点。
    由于现在国际无线电和航空交通日益发达，所以全世界必须有一个标准时间，也就是“世界时间”。通常格林威治时间就被认为是世界上的标准时间。格林威治和我们还有着八个时区的距离，自然在时间上也就有八小时的差别。格林威治晚上八点钟，正好相当于我们这里黎明前的四点钟。
