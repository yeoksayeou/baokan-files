　　"God" No Longer Blesses America
　　Cui Qi
    The rulers of America often say: the twentieth century is the "American Century," and America has the "mission to lead the world."
    But who exactly gave the American rulers this "mission"? The answer is: "God."
    Truman said: "We have finally undertaken the leadership task that Almighty God arranged for us in the last generation." (Speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, July 1952)
    Dulles said: Americans "have a sense of responsibility in the world, believing that their obligation is to help people everywhere become what God intended them to be and do the work God intended." (Speech at the Illinois Manufacturers Association in Chicago, December 1955)
    In short, in the eyes of people like Truman and Dulles, Americans are inherently "God's chosen people."
    Since they are "God's chosen people," of course they must be "superior" and "advanced" in everything. No matter what, America should be "number one in the world." The "New York Times" believes that "America's belief" has always been this: "This country... must always be the first and the best in every important aspect of endeavor." America's "strength" is "number one in the world." America's science, technology, culture, and education are "number one in the world." Even sports are no exception. American journalist Roy Considine, who recently visited Comrade Khrushchev, said that the Soviet athletes' victories in the Olympic Games were completely "unexpected" for Americans, "because we have become accustomed to the view that America wins in these competitions."
    Indeed, "habit" is a stubborn thing. But, after all, there is another thing in the world that is more powerful than habit.
    One day in early October, just as the heroes of Washington were celebrating the weekend in their most accustomed atmosphere, an event occurred on Earth that they were most unaccustomed to: the first artificial satellite was launched from Soviet soil (rather than from the "world's number one" American soil)! "Ignorant and illiterate (Russian) peasants who have essentially just emerged from primitive conditions" ("New York Times" quote) actually ran ahead of "God's chosen people"! In the words of British scientist Arthur Clarke, "Since Saturday, America has become a second-rate country."
    According to past habits, when American rulers encounter this kind of unaccustomed thing, they can seem to get away with everything by shouting "We don't recognize it!" a few times. But, that doesn't work now. The first red moon rose, and then the second red moon rose. They seem to be a pair of angels of peace. They don't need the U.S. State Department's "recognition," they don't need Mr. Dulles's visa, and they don't need to go anywhere to get their fingerprints taken to travel around America and around the world day and night. Every dusk, how many people want to see their light on the horizon! Every night, how many families want to hear their singing on the radio! This is really terrible for the gentlemen of the "Un-American Activities Committee": the whole world is listening to "Communist propaganda!" But can you put all the residents of the earth on the blacklist?
    The facts have finally changed some Americans' "habits." Some American scientists and commentators have had to admit that the Soviet Union is advanced in science and technology, and also advanced in national education, and that the United States is lagging behind. Some American newspapers even admitted that the Soviet launch of artificial satellites marked the bankruptcy of America's "policy of strength." "Stone's Weekly" said, "The cornerstone of American post-war policy collapsed overnight." The "Christian Science Monitor" said that the era of American hegemony has passed.
    But why exactly is America lagging behind? Those who regard themselves as "God's chosen people" are most afraid to answer this question. They are afraid to draw conclusions about social system issues. They want to cover up the essence of this question with all sorts of absurd answers.
    The answer of Detroit evangelist Billy Graham is one of the most absurd. He said desperately: the appearance of the Soviet artificial satellite seems to prove that the "end of the world" for mankind has arrived. It is said that this is because "God" no longer blesses America and will also punish it.
    We do not intend to discuss religious beliefs here. However, the "God" who "blesses" the likes of Dulles has lost his power, which no one can deny. The so-called "end of the world" is of course nonsense. Today, mankind is facing an infinitely bright and vast future, and mankind's confidence in conquering nature and hope for building a better social life are rising to unprecedented heights with the Soviet artificial satellites! But for those fanatical executors of the "policy of strength" and dreamers of the "American Century," it is another matter: the Soviet artificial satellites have indeed pronounced their doomsday!

### “上帝”不再保佑美国了

　　“上帝”不再保佑美国了
　　崔奇
    美国的统治者经常说：二十世纪是“美国世纪”，美国负有“领导世界的使命”。
    可是究竟是谁给了美国统治者这种“使命”呢？答案是：“上帝”。
    杜鲁门说：“我们终于担负起了万能的上帝在上一代就给我们安排好了的领导任务。”（1952年7月在芝加哥民主党代表大会上的演说）
    杜勒斯说：美国人“在世界上有责任感，相信他们的义务是在一切地方帮助人们成为上帝所指定的人和做上帝指定的工作。”（1955年12月在芝加哥伊利诺斯制造商协会的演说）
    总之，在杜鲁门和杜勒斯这些人看来，美国人天生就是“上帝的选民”。
    既然是“上帝的选民”，当然处处都要比别人“优越”和“先进”了。不管什么事情，美国都应该“世界第一”。“纽约时报”认为，“美国的信念”一向就是这样：“这个国家……在每一个努力的重要方面永远必须是第一的和最好的。”美国的“实力”，是“世界第一”的。美国的科学技术和文化教育，是“世界第一”的。就连体育运动，也不能例外。最近访问过赫鲁晓夫同志的美国记者罗·康西丁说：苏联运动员在奥林匹克运动会中得到的胜利，对于美国人是完全“意外”的，“因为我们已经习惯于美国在这些竞赛中取得胜利的看法了”。
    的确，“习惯”是顽强的东西。但是，世界上毕竟还有另一种东西，它比习惯的力量更强大。
    10月初的一天，正当华盛顿的英雄豪杰们在他们最习惯的气氛中欢度周末的时候，地球上发生了一件他们最不习惯的事件：第一个人造卫星从苏联的土地上（而不是从“世界第一”的美国土地上）升起了！“本质上还只是刚刚从原始的条件下脱胎出来的无知的不识字的（俄国）农民”（“纽约时报”语），居然跑到“上帝的选民”前边去了！用英国科学家阿瑟·克拉克的话说：“从星期六起，美国已经成了第二流的国家”。
    按照过去的习惯，美国统治者遇到这一类的不习惯的事情，只要大喊几声“不承认！”也就似乎可以万事大吉。但是，现在不行了。第一颗红色月亮升起了，第二颗红色月亮又升起了。她们好像是一对和平的天使。她们不需要美国国务院的“承认”，不需要杜勒斯先生的签证，也不需要到什么地方去按指印，就可以日日夜夜周游美国，周游世界。每个黄昏，有多少人想在天边看见她们的光芒！每个夜晚，有多少个家庭想在收音机里听到她们的歌唱！这对于“非美活动委员会”的老爷们说来，实在太可怕了：全世界都在听信“共产主义的宣传！”但是难道能够把地球上的全体居民都列入黑名单吗？
    事实终于改变了一些美国人的“习惯”。美国有些科学家和评论家不得不承认，苏联在科学技术方面是先进的，在国民教育方面也是先进的，美国是落后了。有一些美国报刊并且承认，苏联发射人造卫星标志着美国“实力政策”的破产。“斯通周刊”说：“美国战后政策的基石一夜之间就崩溃了。”“基督教科学箴言报”说，美国称王称霸的时代已经过去。
    但是，究竟为什么美国落后了呢？以“上帝的选民”自居的人们是最害怕回答这个问题的。他们害怕得出关于社会制度问题的结论。他们想用各种各样荒唐的答案来掩盖这个问题的本质。
    底特律布道员毕利·格雷姆的答案，就是最荒唐的一个。他绝望地说：苏联人造卫星的出现，仿佛证明人类的“世界末日”降临了。据说，这是因为“上帝”已经不再保佑美国了，而且还要惩罚它。
    我们在这里不打算谈论宗教信仰问题。但是，“保佑”杜勒斯之流的“上帝”已经失灵，这却是任何人都不能不承认的了。所谓“世界末日”降临，当然是胡说。今天，人类正面对着无限光明辽阔的未来，人类征服自然的信心和建设美好社会生活的希望，正在随着苏联人造卫星而上升到前所未有的高度！但是，对于那些“实力政策”的狂热执行者和“美国世纪”的幻想家来说，却是另外一回事：苏联人造卫星的确宣判了他们的末日！
