    Long Live the Great Solidarity of the Asian and African Peoples
    The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference of great historical significance is scheduled to open today in Cairo, the capital of Egypt. This is the largest non-governmental gathering in Asian-African history. Our people have sent a delegation headed by Guo Moruo, a famous Chinese peace advocate, to participate. Today, we Chinese people, together with the people of Asian and African countries, warmly celebrate the opening of the conference and sincerely wish it success!
    More than forty countries and regions from Asia and Africa, with a total population of about two-thirds of mankind, have sent representatives to participate in this conference. Although the people of these countries and regions differ in their social systems, ideologies, and customs, we all share common experiences and aspirations. The vast majority of the people of Asia and Africa have suffered or are suffering from the oppression, enslavement, and exploitation of imperialism, and have tasted the pain and torment of colonialism. This shared experience and plight connect the hearts of the Asian and African peoples. To strive for and safeguard independence and freedom, to consolidate world peace, and to promote friendly relations between all peoples are the common demands of the Asian and African peoples. It is precisely because of this that the 1.8 billion people of Asia and Africa can unite ever more closely and can support and help each other in the common struggle for independence, peace, and friendship. The convening of this Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference demonstrates in a concentrated way that the scale of Asian-African people's solidarity has reached a new peak.
    The convening of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference is the result of the continued development of the Bandung spirit. For more than two years, the Bandung spirit has had a tremendous and profound impact on Asia and Africa and in vast regions of the world. On the basis of the continuous upsurge of national independence movements after the Second World War, the struggle of the Asian and African peoples against colonialism has achieved a series of new victories. Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia, Ghana, and Malaya have declared independence. In Algeria, Oman, Yemen, Cyprus, Kenya, Cameroon, Uganda, and Ifni, despite the barbaric armed aggression and suppression by imperialism, the flames of the anti-colonialist struggle are still burning fiercely. In particular, the great victory of the Egyptian people in resisting the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel last year, the heroic struggle of the Syrian people to crush the aggression threat from the United States and Turkey this year, and the recent large-scale patriotic movement launched by the Indonesian people to recover West Irian most powerfully demonstrate that the Asian and African peoples have stood up and the days when imperialist colonialists could run rampant are gone forever. The anti-colonialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples has become an irresistible historical trend of our times. We believe that the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference will continue to carry forward the Bandung spirit, raise the banner of independence and freedom even higher, and encourage the Asian and African peoples to advance from victory to victory.
    The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference is also a grand gathering to defend world peace. The Asian and African peoples deeply know that the struggle for national independence and the struggle for world peace are inseparable. Colonialism is the breeding ground for war, and imperialism always uses war to maintain and promote its colonial system; eliminating colonialism means eliminating a source of war and strengthening the forces of peace. At the same time, after shaking off the colonial shackles, the most urgent demand of many Asian and African countries is to be able to build their own countries, develop their economies and cultures, and consolidate their national independence in a peaceful international environment. Therefore, the Asian and African peoples firmly support peace and oppose war. The greatest interest of the Asian and African peoples is peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between countries, and it is no accident that the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit were born on our Asian-African soil. Today, we are pleased to see that the number of countries and peoples who agree with peaceful coexistence is constantly increasing, and the peaceful areas in Asia and Africa are constantly expanding.
    For several years, the Asian and African peoples have actively participated in the struggle to safeguard world peace and have made significant contributions to the cause of world peace and international cooperation. In addition to the Bandung Conference, the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference held in Beijing in 1952, the Asian Countries Conference held in Delhi in 1955, the three international conferences against nuclear weapons held in Japan since 1955, the World Peace Council held in Colombo in 1957, and the grand gatherings of Asian-African students, writers, legal workers, etc., have all powerfully promoted the development of the world peace movement. Encouraged by the Bandung spirit, economic and cultural exchanges between Asian and African countries are also constantly expanding. All of these indicate that the Asian and African peoples have become a powerful force for peace on the international stage. We can fully expect that the convening of this Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference will further strengthen the solidarity and friendship of the Asian and African peoples and further promote the struggle of the Asian and African regions and the people of the world for peace.
    Of course, the imperialists will not be reconciled to their failures in Asia and Africa. At present, whether in the Far East, the Middle East, or Africa, the imperialist bloc headed by the United States is still using military, political, and economic means, adopting overt or covert methods, to desperately pursue colonial aggression policies, threatening and infringing upon the independence and peace of Asian and African countries everywhere. The recently concluded Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization also proves that the Western colonial countries are unwilling to lay down their butcher knives, and they collude with each other to still try to tightly put the colonial shackles on the heads of the Asian and African peoples. These colonial countries are plotting to create division and antagonism in the Asian and African regions, using ethnic disputes to undermine the unity of the Asian and African peoples, and achieve their aggressive purposes. At the same time, we cannot fail to see that in many regions of Asia and Africa, especially in Africa, there are still millions of people under Western colonial rule, living an extremely miserable life of slavery. They are subjected to humiliation and discrimination by Western colonialists, and their blood continues to flow. Therefore, in order to completely smash the heinous colonial system, to consolidate peace in Asia, Africa, and the world, and to promote friendly cooperation between all peoples, the Asian and African peoples need to strengthen solidarity and strengthen our common struggle.
    At the time of the convening of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, we are particularly encouraged by the fact that the overall world situation is very favorable to us, the Asian and African peoples. Today, a new and fundamental turning point has emerged in the balance of international forces. The forces of the socialist countries, the nationally independent countries, and the peace-loving people of the world have overwhelmed the forces of imperialism. The advantage belongs to us, and the future belongs to us. As long as the Asian and African peoples unite more closely and better unite with all peace-loving forces in Europe, America, and Australia, our strength will be even greater and our victory will be more guaranteed. What imperialism fears most is the unity of peace-loving forces, so it does not hesitate to use the most despicable methods to provoke and divide the friendly relations between the peoples of Asian and African countries. However, throwing a handful of sand cannot block the sun. Let us shout: Long live the great solidarity of the Asian and African peoples! Long live the great solidarity of the people of the world!

### 亚非人民大团结万岁

    亚非人民大团结万岁
    具有重大历史意义的亚非团结大会定于今天在埃及首都开罗开幕。这是亚非历史上规模最大的一次民间性的集会。我国人民已经派遣了以我国著名和平人士郭沫若为首的代表团前往参加。今天，我们中国人民同亚非各国人民一起，热烈欢呼大会开幕，并衷心预祝大会成功！
    派出代表参加这次大会的包括亚非四十多个国家和地区，它们的总人口约占全人类的三分之二。虽然这些国家和地区的人民在社会制度、意识形态和语言风俗等方面各有差异，但是我们大家却有着共同的经历和共同的愿望。亚非绝大部分的人民都曾经遭受过或者正在遭受着帝国主义的压迫、奴役和宰割，备尝殖民主义的痛苦和折磨。这种共同的经历和遭遇使亚非人民的心连在一起。争取和维护独立自由，巩固世界和平，促进各国人民之间的友好相处，是亚非人民的共同要求。正是因为这样，亚非两大洲十八亿人民能够日益紧密地团结起来，并且能够在争取独立、和平、友好的共同斗争中互相支持，互相帮助。这次亚非团结大会的召开，集中地显示了亚非人民团结的规模已经达到一个新的高峰。
    亚非团结大会的召开，是万隆精神继续发展的结果。两年多以来，万隆精神已经在亚非两洲以及世界广大地区发生了巨大的深刻的影响。在第二次世界大战后民族独立运动不断高涨的基础上，亚非人民反殖民主义的斗争又获得一系列新的胜利。苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯、加纳和马来亚已经宣布独立。在阿尔及利亚、阿曼、也门、塞浦路斯、怯尼亚、喀麦隆、乌干达和伊夫尼等地方，尽管帝国主义实行野蛮的武装侵略和镇压，但是那里的反殖民主义斗争的烽火仍然在猛烈地燃烧着。特别是去年埃及人民抗击英、法和以色列侵略者所得到的伟大胜利，和今年叙利亚人民为粉碎美国和土耳其的侵略威胁而进行的英勇斗争，以及最近印度尼西亚人民为收复西伊里安而发起的声势浩大的爱国运动，最有力地说明了亚非人民已经站起来了，帝国主义殖民者横行霸道的日子已经一去不复返了。亚非人民反殖民主义的斗争，已经成为我们时代的不可抗拒的历史潮流。我们相信，亚非团结大会将继续发扬万隆精神，更高地举起独立自由的旗帜，鼓舞亚非人民从胜利走向胜利。
    亚非团结大会也是保卫世界和平的盛大集会。亚非人民深深知道，争取民族独立的斗争和争取世界和平的斗争是分不开的。殖民主义是战争的温床，帝国主义总是用战争来维持和推行它的殖民制度；消灭殖民主义，也就是消灭战争的一个根源，并加强和平的力量。同时，许多亚非国家在挣脱了殖民枷锁以后，最迫切的要求就是能够在一个和平的国际环境中建设自己的国家，发展自己的经济和文化，巩固自己的民族独立。因此，亚非人民是坚决拥护和平和反对战争的。亚非人民的最大利益就是各国和平共处和友好合作，著名的和平共处五项原则和万隆精神诞生在我们亚非的土地上并不是偶然的。今天，我们高兴地看到，赞成和平共处的国家和人民正在不断增多，亚非两洲的和平地区正在不断扩大。
    几年以来，亚非人民积极参加了维护世界和平的斗争，对世界和平与国际合作事业作了重大的贡献。除了万隆会议以外，1952年在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，1955年在德里召开的亚洲国家会议，1955年以来在日本举行的三次反对核武器的国际大会，1957年在科仑坡举行的世界和平理事会，以及亚非学生、作家、法律工作者等等的盛大集会，都有力地推动了世界和平运动的发展。在万隆精神的鼓舞下，亚非各国之间的经济与文化交流也在不断扩大。所有这些都表明，亚非人民已经成为国际舞台上的一支强大的和平力量。我们完全可以预期，这一次亚非团结大会的召开，将会进一步加强亚非人民的团结和友谊，并进一步推进亚非地区以及全世界人民争取和平的斗争。
    当然，帝国主义者们对于他们在亚非地区的失败是不会甘心的。目前，不论在远东，在中东，还是在非洲，以美国为首的帝国主义集团，仍然在利用军事的、政治的和经济的种种手段，采取公开的或者隐蔽的方式，拼命推行殖民侵略政策，到处威胁和侵犯亚非国家的独立和和平。刚刚结束的北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议也证明，西方殖民国家是不愿意放下屠刀的，它们相互勾结仍然企图把殖民枷锁紧紧地套在亚非人民的头上。这些殖民国家正阴谋在亚非地区制造分裂和对立，利用民族纠纷来破坏亚非人民的团结，实现他们的侵略目的。同时，我们不能不看到，在亚非的许多地区，特别是在非洲，至今还有千百万人民处于西方殖民统治之下，过着极端悲惨的奴隶生活。他们备受西方殖民者的凌辱和歧视，他们的血一直在流着。因此，为了彻底粉碎万恶的殖民制度，为了巩固亚非和世界的和平，为了促进各国人民之间的友好合作，亚非人民还需要加强团结，加强我们的共同斗争。
    在亚非团结大会召开的时候，我们特别感到鼓舞的是，整个世界局势对我们亚非人民是十分有利的。今天国际力量的对比已经出现新的根本转折点。社会主义国家和民族独立国家的人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的力量，已经压倒了帝国主义的力量。优势是属于我们的，未来是属于我们的。只要亚非人民更加紧密地团结起来，并且同欧洲、美洲以及澳洲一切爱好和平的力量更好地联合起来，那末我们的力量就更加强大，我们的胜利就更加有保障。帝国主义最害怕的就是爱好和平力量的团结一致，因此它不惜用最卑鄙的办法来挑拨和分化亚非各国人民的友好关系。但是，扬起一把沙土，是挡不住太阳的。让我们高呼：亚非人民大团结万岁！世界人民大团结万岁！
