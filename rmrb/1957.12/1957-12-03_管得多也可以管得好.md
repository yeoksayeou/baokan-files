　　Han Zizhen, the deputy manager of the Tianjin Purchasing and Supplying Station of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation, was very unamenable to criticism from the masses. During this "blooming and contending" period, the masses offered him 200 opinions, and he felt that only one was correct, while the other 199 were not. Moreover, he felt that the one correct opinion was only valid because of the excessive changes in leadership, which made it difficult to manage, seemingly implying that he had no subjective responsibility. Furthermore, he grumbled, saying, "The more things one manages, the more opinions the masses have."

　　Is it really the case that "the more things one manages, the more opinions the masses have"? No. The issue is not whether one manages many things, but whether one manages them well. If one manages many things and manages them well, the masses will have few or even no opinions. Conversely, even if one manages few things but manages them poorly, the masses will have opinions, and possibly many. A leader who is good at relying on the masses and pooling their wisdom will definitely manage well, even if they manage many things.

　  管得多也可以管得好
    中国医药公司天津采购供应站副经理韩子珍，对群众批评很不虚心，这次鸣放中群众对他提了二百条意见，他认为只有一条对，其余一百九十九条都不对。而那一条对的也是因为领导变化太多，不好掌握，似乎他主观上并没有责任。而且他还发牢骚说：“管事多了群众意见就多”。
    真是“管事多了群众意见就多”吗？不是的。问题不在管的事多不多，而在管的好不好。管得多如果管得好，群众意见就少甚至会没有意见，相反，事情即使管得少但管得不好，群众也会有意见而且可能很多。一个领导者，如果善于依靠群众，集中群众的智慧，即使事情管得很多，也一定管得很好。
