　　Patriotic Health Campaigns Should Be Regularized
　　——On the Experience of Hygiene Work in the Shanyin Road First Residential District, Hongkou District, Shanghai
　　Shen Songxi
　　The Shanyin Road residential district in Hongkou District, Shanghai, is a residential area. It has a total of 666 households, with 3,593 residents, including 980 children under the age of ten. Residents come from all social strata, with workers and staff accounting for about 70%. Before liberation, there were four public garbage bins in the Shanyin Road alleyways. Because no one managed them, garbage piled up in front of every household, uncovered and attracting flies. Drains were blocked, and the situation of urinating and defecating everywhere, spitting everywhere, littering, and dumping sewage was also very serious. In summer and autumn, mosquitoes and flies bred, and diseases were rampant. Parents were often indifferent when their children had upset stomachs, and some people even said, "Money can't buy diarrhea in June." After liberation, due to the launch of the patriotic health campaign and the elimination of the four pests, the masses' hygiene awareness improved, and every household actively took action to improve environmental and personal hygiene. Since 1956, households have no longer needed mosquito nets, and many families have adopted serving chopsticks and spoons or separate eating. They regularly maintain the ground free of sputum, drains unblocked, and no debris outside the garbage bins. Adults and children have generally developed good hygiene habits.

　　Because of emphasizing hygiene, residents also pay attention to epidemic prevention work. There have been no cases of diphtheria for three years. Last year, during the measles epidemic, all 124 patients survived because they were well cared for. Because residents are active in the patriotic health campaign and have achieved remarkable results, it was rated as a model unit in the city, and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government also issued a certificate of merit.

　　The reason why the patriotic health campaign in Shanyin Road has been successful in recent years is the result of the extensive, in-depth, and regular propaganda work of the Patriotic Health Committee.

　　The leading cadres of this district's residents' committee have always attached great importance to carrying out the patriotic health campaign. Under a unified plan, they adopted the method of "division of responsibility by block, contract responsibility by group" (dividing the more than twenty groups in the entire residential district into eight large blocks, each with a member of the residents' committee and a women's committee member as the person in charge), clearly proposing that "everyone is responsible for hygiene propaganda," and cadres actively participated in propaganda work.

　　In carrying out propaganda activities, in addition to mobilizing and deploying the hygiene work tasks for each period through various meetings and written and oral propaganda, they also used various methods to conduct regular propaganda in combination with other work and the daily life of the masses.

　　In terms of combining with other work for propaganda, they came up with various methods and combined with various central movements, such as combining the propaganda of new-style delivery and maternal and child health when publicizing the Marriage Law; combining the propaganda of breaking superstitions such as "immortal water" and "incense ash" when publicizing the banning of reactionary secret societies; combining the propaganda of paying attention to hygiene, reducing diseases, saving medical expenses, participating in savings, improving life, health, and happiness when publicizing patriotic savings; combining the propaganda of stepping up rat extermination to prevent rats from biting wires and causing fires when publicizing simple fire prevention.

　　In these propaganda efforts, because the combination was very natural, and through couplets, rhymes, and other languages and forms that are easily accepted by the masses, the results were very good. They not only did a good job in hygiene work but also did a good job in other work. For example, when celebrating the "March 8th" International Women's Day and promoting the "Five Goods," they combined it with promoting the close relationship between paying attention to hygiene, eliminating the four pests, and the "Five Goods." In the propaganda, they clearly told women that if they did not pay attention to hygiene and their families were often sick, seeing a doctor and taking medicine would be stressful and costly, so they could not be said to have "arranged family life well." If their children had "two lines of snot, rolled around on the ground, were filthy, and had dirt under their fingernails," how could they talk about "educating children well."

　　When promoting "good family and neighborhood unity" and "good education of children," they also composed a couplet:

　　"Unite with neighbors starting from patriotic health to eliminate the four pests
　　Educate children with communist moral qualities first"

　　When publicizing that women should use hot porridge, hot rice, hot dishes, hot soup, and enthusiasm to "encourage relatives to work well and study well," it was explained that if this "five goods" woman striving for the "Five Goods" did not pay attention to hygiene and the four pests were rampant in her home, if flies were found in the hot soup and rat droppings were found in the hot rice, how could her relatives be healthy. The women in the alleyways were very interested in these propaganda efforts and were willing to accept them. Even the two shops, Dachang Sauce Shop at No. 49 Shanyin Road and Zuiyuan Hotel at No. 51, who used to be on non-speaking terms due to hygiene and children's problems, gradually corrected their erroneous attitudes of letting their children go after receiving propaganda, corrected their habits of not paying attention to cultivating children's hygiene, and everyone became friendly again.

　　Another example: In the autumn of 1956, when mobilizing residents to donate winter clothes and exchange foreign currency, the Patriotic Health Campaign Committee combined it with mobilizing residents to launch a surprise rat extermination campaign. At that time, in order to ensure the thorough implementation of rat extermination work and leave no dead corners, the slogan "Clear out the bottom of the box" was put forward, and a three-sentence rhyme that was easy for the masses to remember was compiled:

　　"Every household clears out the bottom of the box, and the disaster victims have winter clothes";
　　"Clear out the bottom of the box and feel the bottom of the bag, are there any foreign shares or foreign currency?";
　　"Every household clears out the bottom of the box, and attention should be paid to catching rats and blocking holes, eliminating dead corners and eliminating the four pests, and not forgetting hygiene work." Residents heard that "clearing out the bottom of the box" had so many benefits, and everyone went back to take action. As a result, more than 1,000 pieces of winter clothing and more than 1,000 yuan in lieu of clothing were raised. Many families cleared out foreign currency and stocks from the bottom of the box. Some families took advantage of the "clearing out the bottom of the box" to carry out a thorough cleaning of the corners, and also blocked more than 50 rat holes and caught the small rats in the box.

　　In terms of combining with residents' daily life habits for propaganda, they were also carried out flexibly according to the person and the matter. For example, for the unhygienic phenomena of raising chickens in the alleyways and "spitting everywhere," a couplet consisting of thirty characters was written on blackboards, big-character posters, and patriotic health calendars to publicize to residents.

　　"Spreading bacteria and spreading lung disease, spitting everywhere is really dangerous
　　Wasting food and attracting flies, raising chickens in the alleyways is unhygienic"

　　When residents saw this, they generally felt that it was "just what they wanted." Through propaganda, they were able to achieve "no sputum on the ground." And the few families who raised chickens consciously slaughtered the chickens for food and thoroughly rinsed the chicken-raising areas.

　　Another example: Wang Xiuying, a woman from No. 34 Sidali, one day, her child had leftover rice, and she insisted that he eat it. After learning about this incident, the cadres of the Patriotic Health Committee promoted: "Eating at a fixed time and in a fixed amount helps normal digestion, not only ordering grain accurately but also being healthy." "Eating not too much, digestion is normal; gobbling it down damages the stomach and intestines; getting stomach disease is very painful; chewing slowly and swallowing slowly increases nutrition."

　　They also adopted the form of symposiums to carry out hygiene propaganda. They held housewives' symposiums, at which they invited women to exchange experiences in eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene in managing their families. During the Dragon Boat Festival, they also invited elderly people to hold a festival tea party. The old gentlemen talked about the benefits and experiences of eliminating the four pests at the meeting.

　　In addition to carrying out general written propaganda, they also carried out propaganda through various methods such as "Patriotic Health Calendar," "Four Pests Elimination Quiz Game," "Inspection Results Announcement Form," and "Patriotic Health Four Pests Elimination Work Annual Record Form." For example, the Patriotic Health Calendar used the calendar format, writing a small report on hygiene work every day. The content included hygiene model deeds, introductions to hygiene knowledge, small literary works, four pests elimination achievements, climate forecasts, etc. Since June 1, 1953, three sets of calendars have been issued every day and hung at the entrances of the three lanes, never missing a deadline. Not only were the residents of the alleyways educated, but also the passers-by were very interested.

　　Riddles, arithmetic, fill-in-the-blank questions, and other questions were used to invite residents to participate in the test. More than 600 copies were issued at one time, and more than 580 answers were received, with most scores above 80 points. Residents were very interested in this and often the whole family participated in the test. Cai Jiezhen from No. 25 Sidali not only participated with her whole family but also invited relatives and friends to participate.

　　Shanyin Road Primary School has more than 500 students. Because the schoolyard is small, students use the alleyways as extracurricular activity areas. While residents cleaned the alleyways, elementary school students used chalk to scribble everywhere and threw waste everywhere, causing frequent disputes between the school and residents over environmental hygiene. After the Patriotic Health Campaign Committee cooperated with the school leaders to carry out hygiene education for the elementary school students, the elementary school students actively took action to maintain environmental hygiene and automatically served as small hygiene propagandists. The innocent children, with their crisp and pleasant voices, shouted "Uncle, please don't spit everywhere!" which would make the adults blush and sincerely accept their opinions. (Image attached)

　　爱国卫生宣传要经常化
　　——记上海市虹口区山阴路第一居民区的卫生工作经验
　　沈颂熙
    上海市虹口区山阴路居民区是一个住宅区。共有居民六百六十六户，三千五百九十三人，其中十岁以下儿童九百八十人。居民包括各个阶层，职工约占70％。解放前，山阴路里弄有四只公共垃圾箱，因无人管理，家家门前都堆放垃圾，没遮没盖，招引苍蝇。阴沟堵塞，随地大小便，随地吐痰，乱抛废物，乱泼污水的情况也很严重。一到夏秋季节，蚊蝇丛生，疾病流行。孩子吃坏了肚子，家长往往漫不经心，有的人还说：“有钱难买六月泻”。解放后，由于开展爱国卫生运动和除四害，提高了群众的卫生水平，家家户户都积极动手搞好环境卫生和个人卫生。自1956年以来，各户已用不着张蚊帐，很多人家都采用公筷公匙或分食吃。经常保持地上无痰迹，阴沟畅通，垃圾箱外无粒屑，大人孩子普遍养成了良好的卫生习惯。
    由于讲卫生，居民对于防疫工作也很重视，白喉病例已经三年没有发生，去年在麻疹流行时，一百二十四个患者由于护理得好，没有一个死亡。因为居民对爱国卫生运动积极，成绩显著，曾被评定为全市模范单位，上海市人民政府还发给了奖状。
    山阴路几年来的爱国卫生运动，所以做得好，这是爱国卫生委员会宣传工作做得广泛、深入和经常的结果。
    这个区居民委员会的领导干部，对开展爱国卫生运动一直是很重视的。他们在统一计划下，采取“分块负责，小组包干”的办法（把全居民区二十多个小组分为八个大块，每块有居民委员会委员和妇女委员各一人作为负责人），明确提出“卫生宣传，人人有责”，干部都积极地参加宣传工作。
    在开展宣传活动中，他们除去通过各种会议和文字、口头宣传等方式，动员布置每个时期的卫生工作任务以外，还利用各种方式，结合其他工作和群众的日常生活进行经常性的宣传。
    在结合其他工作宣传方面，他们想出多种办法，结合各项中心运动，如在宣传婚姻法时，结合宣传新法接生和妇幼卫生；宣传取缔反动会道门时，结合宣传破除“仙水”、“香灰”等的迷信；在宣传爱国储蓄时，结合宣传讲究卫生，减少疾病，节省医药费用，参加储蓄，改善生活，健康幸福；在宣传简易防止火险时，结合宣传要加紧打鼠，以防鼠咬电线，引起火灾。
    在这些宣传中，由于结合得很自然，又通过联语、顺口溜等易为群众接受的语言和形式，效果都很好，既做好了卫生工作，也做好了其他工作。如在庆祝“三八”国际妇女节宣传“五好”时，结合宣传讲卫生，除四害和“五好”的密切关系。在宣传中对妇女讲清楚，要是不讲卫生，家人多病，看病吃药，劳神伤财，就说不上“家庭生活安排好了”，要是孩子们“两行鼻涕，打滚满地，混身肮脏，指甲藏泥”，那里还谈得上“教育子女好”。
    在宣传“家庭邻居团结好”、“教育子女好”时，还编出一幅联语：
    “团结邻居从爱国卫生消灭四害做起
    教育子女以共产主义道德品质为先”
    在宣传妇女要以热粥、热饭、热菜、热汤和热心“鼓励亲人工作好，学习好”时，就说明要是这位争取“五好”的“五热”妇女不注意卫生，家中四害猖獗，热汤里捞出了苍蝇，热饭里发现了鼠屎，她的亲人如何能健康。里弄妇女听到这些宣传很感兴趣，很乐意接受。甚至像山阴路四十九号大成酱酒店和五十一号醉园大酒店两户店铺，从前因为卫生问题和孩子问题闹得对面不讲话，自接受宣传以后，两户家长就逐步的端正了放任子女的错误态度，纠正了不注意培养儿童卫生的习惯，大家又重归于好。
    又如1956年秋季发动居民劝募寒衣和兑换外币时，爱国卫生运动委员会就结合着发动居民突击捕鼠。当时为了保证捕鼠工作彻底贯彻，不留死角，就提出了“清箱底”的口号，并编出群众易记的三句顺口溜：
    “家家户户清箱底，灾民身上有寒衣”；
    “清清箱底摸袋底，可有洋股与外币”；
    “家家户户清箱底，捕鼠堵洞要注意，消灭死角除四害，卫生工作不忘记。”居民听到“清箱底”有那么多的好处，大家都回去行动起来。结果募集了寒衣一千余件，代金一千余元，不少人家从箱底里清出了外币和股票，有些人家，趁着“清箱底”的便，进行了四角打扫，还堵塞了鼠洞五十几个，捉住了箱子里的小老鼠。
    在结合居民日常生活习惯进行宣传方面，也都因人因事而灵活进行。如对里弄养鸡和“随地吐痰”的不卫生现象，就以三十个字组成一副对联，写在黑板报、大字报和爱国卫生日历上向居民宣传。
    “散布细菌传开肺病随地吐痰真危险
    浪费粮食招引苍蝇里弄养鸡不卫生”
    居民看到了，都有“正合我意”之概。通过宣传，更能做到“地上无痰迹”。而几户养鸡的人家，也就自觉地宰鸡作食，彻底冲洗了养鸡场地。
    再一个例子：四达里三十四号妇女王秀英，一天，孩子吃剩了饭，她硬要他吃下去。爱国卫生委员会的干部了解这一事例，就宣传：“吃饭定时定量，帮助消化正常，不但订粮准确，而且身体健康。”“食不过量，消化正常；狼吞虎咽，损伤胃肠；得了胃病，痛苦非常；细嚼缓咽，增加营养。”
    他们还采取座谈会的形式进行卫生宣传，召开过的有主妇座谈会，在会上请妇女们交流当家除四害、讲卫生的经验。过端阳节时，他们也曾请老年人来开佳节茶会。老先生们在会上谈了消灭四害的好处和经验。
    他们除去进行一般的文字宣传以外，还通过“爱国卫生日历”、“除四害测验游戏”、“检查成绩公布表”、“爱国卫生除四害工作年度纪录表”等各种方式进行宣传。如爱国卫生日历，是用日历方式，每天编写一小段关于卫生工作的报道。内容有卫生模范事迹，卫生常识介绍，小文艺，除四害成绩，气候预告，等等。自1953年6月1日开始，每天出三组日历，分挂在三条弄口，从不脱期。不但里弄居民受到教育，即来往行人也很感兴趣。
    以谜语、算术、填充问答等问题请居民参加测验。一次发卷六百余份，收到答案五百八十余份，得分大都在八十分以上。居民对此很感兴趣，往往全家参加测验。四达里二十五号蔡洁贞除全家参加外，还请亲友来参加。
    山阴路小学有学生五百余人，因为校院小，学生都是以里弄为课外活动场地。居民们一面把里弄打扫清洁了，小学生一面就用粉笔东涂西抹，废物到处乱抛，因为环境卫生，学校和居民时常发生纠纷。爱国卫生运动委员会配合学校领导对小学生进行了卫生宣传教育以后，小学生都积极行动起来保持环境的卫生，自动地担任卫生小宣传员。天真的孩子们，以清脆悦耳的声音，喊一声“叔叔，请您不要随地吐痰！”就会使大朋友感动得面红耳赤，衷心地接受意见。（附图片）
