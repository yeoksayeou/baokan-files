　　Daily Production of 90,000 Jin of Brown Sugar
　　Anqing Sugar Factory Commences Production

　　(Our Newspaper) News: The newly built Anqing Sugar Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Anhui Province, has recently commenced production.

　　The Anqing Sugar Factory produces 90,000 jin of brown sugar daily, with a production period of 120 to 150 days per year. It is the first sugarcane sugar factory in Anhui Province and also the first modern sugar factory in the temperate region of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. When the Anqing Municipal Party Committee proposed building this sugar factory, it was met with opposition from many people, and even some experts expressed doubts, arguing that sugarcane could only be produced in tropical or subtropical regions, while Anqing was a temperate region, and building a sugar factory based on sugarcane cultivation had no theoretical basis. After two or three years of sugarcane trial planting, the results were very good, with the sugar content of the sugarcane averaging 12%, and reaching as high as 13.7%, comparable to that of Guangdong Province, a sugar-producing region. The yield per unit area reached 20,000 jin per mu in good cases, which is rare even in Guangdong. The biggest difficulty due to the short frost-free period in the temperate zone was the sugarcane preservation problem, which has also been resolved after researching and experimenting with three or four methods.

    日产红糖九万斤
　  安庆糖厂开工生产
    本报讯　安徽省新建地方国营安庆糖厂已于最近开工生产。
    安庆糖厂日产九万斤红糖，一年生产一百二十到一百五十天。它是安徽省第一座甘蔗糖厂，也是长江中下游温带地区第一座现代化糖厂。安庆市委倡议建设这个糖厂时曾遭到许多人的反对，甚至一些专家也表示怀疑，理由是甘蔗只能生产在热带或亚热带，安庆是温带地区，种甘蔗建糖厂没有理论根据。经过两三年来试种甘蔗，效果很好，甘蔗的含糖份平均达12％，高至13.7％，与产糖的广东省比较也不相上下。单位面积产量每亩好的达到两万斤，这个产量在广东也是少有的。温带无霜期短，最大的困难是甘蔗保藏问题，经过研究试验三、四种方法，也得到解决。
