Weightlifting Competition Held Among Four Beijing Institutes and Schools
	Zhao Qingkui Breaks Four National Records

	(Our Newspaper) Beijing Institute of Geology and Exploration, Beijing Institute of Physical Education, Beijing Petroleum Institute, and Tsinghua University held a friendly weightlifting competition among the four institutes and schools on the afternoon of the 15th. Chen Jingkai, Huang Qianghui, Zhao Qingkui, and two other members of the national weightlifting team were invited to give exhibition performances.

	After more than four hours of competition, the Beijing Institute of Physical Education won the championships in five weight classes: flyweight, bantamweight, lightweight, middleweight, and light heavyweight, and won first place in the overall team score. The Beijing Institute of Geology and Exploration and Tsinghua University won second and third place in the overall team score, respectively.

	In this exhibition performance, the five athletes of the national weightlifting team broke seven national records. Among them, Zhao Qingkui alone broke all four records in the light heavyweight class with a press of 127.5 kg, a snatch of 122.5 kg, a clean and jerk of 167.5 kg, and a total score of 417.5 kg. This score is 27.5 kg more than the total score of 390 kg he created not long ago in the National Weightlifting Competition held in Guangzhou, equivalent to the total score of 417.5 kg of the American George, who won third place in the light heavyweight class at the 16th Olympic Games. In the history of weightlifting in our country, no athlete has ever lifted this weight.

	Chen Jingkai broke the national records for the clean and jerk (137.5 kg) and total score (330 kg) in the bantamweight class. Huang Qianghui's snatch of 110 kg also broke the national record for the snatch in the middleweight class.

	During the competition, Chen Jingkai and Huang Qianghui repeatedly explained the postures and essentials of weightlifting movements to some weightlifting athletes.

	The "Teacher and Staff Home" of the Beijing Institute of Geology and Exploration, which can accommodate more than 1,000 people, was crowded with students from the four institutes and schools who loved weightlifting on the afternoon of the 15th. They repeatedly applauded and cheered for the athletes participating in the competition.

    北京四院、校举行举重比赛
    赵庆奎破四项全国纪录
    本报讯　北京地质勘探学院、北京体育学院、北京石油学院和清华大学在15日下午举行了一场四院、校的举重友谊比赛。国家举重队的陈镜开、黄强辉、赵庆奎等五人应邀前往作了表演比赛。
    经过四个多小时的比赛，北京体育学院夺得了最轻级、次轻级、轻量级、中量级和次重级的五个项目的冠军，获得了团体总分第一名，北京地质勘探学院和清华大学分别获得了团体总分的第二、第三名。
    国家举重队的五名运动员在这场表演比赛中，打破了七个项目的全国最高纪录，其中赵庆奎一人就以推举一百二十七点五公斤、抓举一百二十二点五公斤、挺举一百六十七点五公斤和总成绩四百一十七点五公斤打破了轻重量级的四项全部纪录，这个成绩比他不久以前在广州举行的全国举重比赛中创造的三百九十公斤的总成绩还多了二十七点五公斤，相等于十六届奥运会轻重量级第三名美国人乔治的四百一十七点五公斤的总成绩。在我国的举重史上，还没有一个运动员能举起这个重量。
    陈镜开以挺举一百三十七点五公斤和总成绩三百三十公斤打破了次轻级的这两个项目的全国纪录，黄强辉的抓举一百一十公斤也打破了中量级抓举的全国纪录。
    在比赛中，陈镜开、黄强辉曾多次对一些举重运动员讲解举重动作的姿势、要领。
    能容纳一千多人的北京地质勘探学院的“教工之家”15日下午被四个院、校的爱好举重的学生挤得水泄不通，他们曾一再地为参加比赛的运动员鼓掌助威。
