    Apprentice Term and Subsidies are Just Right
    Disagreeing with Wang Rong's Opinion
    Comrade Wang Rong believes that the apprenticeship period stipulated by the State Council is too long and the living allowance is too low (see page two of this newspaper on December 10). I disagree with his opinion.
    Comrade Wang said that in the new society, masters are not conservative, and apprentices have a higher cultural level than before liberation. This is a fact. However, we cannot shorten the learning period just because we have these favorable conditions. The cultural level of senior elementary school and middle school is still not up to the needs of national construction and production development. The state requires a worker not only to theoretically understand a technology but also to use it proficiently. The state also requires workers to have the noble qualities of the working class. To meet these requirements, three years of study and practice are necessary.
    Is the apprentice's living allowance low? I don't think it's low; it's much better than the life of apprentices in the old society. China has a large population, and the current economy is still backward, so it is not right to demand very high living allowances. For the sake of long-term interests in the future, it is beneficial to the country and individuals to be a little more hardworking and have a smaller living allowance now.
    In short, I think the State Council's regulations are just right.

    学徒期限和补贴恰到好处
    不同意王熔意见
    王熔同志认为国务院规定的徒工学习期限长了，生活补贴低了（见12月10日本报二版）。我不同意他的意见。
    王同志说，在新社会里，师傅不保守，徒工文化水平又比解放前的高。这是事实。但是，不能因为有了这些有利条件就可以缩短学习期限。高小和中学的文化程度，也还是赶不上国家建设和生产发展的需要的。国家要求一个工人，不仅要从理论上懂得一门技术，还要熟练地运用。国家还要求工人具有工人阶级的高贵品质。要达到这些要求，非有三年的学习和锻炼不可。
    徒工的生活补贴是不是低呢？我看不低，比旧社会的徒工生活不知好多少。我国人口多，目前的经济还落后，要求很高的生活补贴也是不对的。为了今后的长远利益，目前艰苦一点，生活补贴少一点，对国家对个人都是有好处的。
    总之，我认为国务院的规定正恰到好处。
