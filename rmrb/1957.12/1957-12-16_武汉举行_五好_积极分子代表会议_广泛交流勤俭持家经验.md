Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, The city of Wuhan held its first "Five-Good" activist representatives meeting from the 9th to the 11th of December. The meeting mobilized women throughout the city to actively implement the policy of building the country and managing households through diligence and thrift, and to deeply promote the "Five-Good" activities.

During the meeting, the representatives widely exchanged experiences in frugal housekeeping. Pi Yanqun, a representative of the "Five-Good" collective unit from the Democratic Jiuli Family Group of the Wuchang No. 1 Paper Mill, reported on the gains made by the group in carrying out the "Five-Good" activities. She said: This group has sixteen households. Before promoting the "Five-Good" principles, almost every family had no financial plan, and debt and usury were rampant. Couples, mothers-in-law and daughters often quarreled because of this. After promoting the "Five-Good" principles, all members of the group began to learn to plan their lives and live within their means. Over the past two years, the phenomenon of debt has been completely eliminated, and most people have developed the habit of saving thriftily. Significant achievements have also been made in saving grain, coal, water, and electricity. Statistics from June to August alone show that the entire group saved 137 jin of grain and 350 jin of coal, while living a better life than before. Relationships between families and neighbors have also improved, ensuring that employees do not have absences from production and can rest well when they return home. Zhang Xin, director of the Transportation Department of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, introduced how he and his wife, Zhou Lianfen (an official of the Municipal Women's Federation), jointly managed household affairs well.

For more than two years, he has been working with his wife to make life plans, jointly manage household affairs, and educate their children. Not only do they work well, but they also live a frugal and happy family life. Li Chunpei, a frugal housekeeping expert, also introduced how she continues to adhere to frugal housekeeping while constantly improving her living standards. Her husband's salary has increased significantly in recent years. Based on the increase in salary, she appropriately improved their living conditions and increased some entertainment and food expenses, but still maintained a hard-working and simple lifestyle, saving as much grain, cotton cloth, coal, water, and electricity as possible. She often had surplus grain and cotton cloth coupons to hand in, making sure not to spend a penny recklessly or waste anything.

Li Erzhong, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the meeting and gave a report. He called on everyone to raise their socialist ideological awareness, promote the "Five-Good" principles deeply and widely, and establish more socialist families. Li Dongqing, director of the Wuhan Municipal Women's Federation, also gave a report at the meeting.

    新华社武汉电　9日到11日武汉市举行了第一次“五好”积极分子代表会议，动员全市妇女积极贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭持家的方针，深入开展“五好”活动。
    会议期间，代表们广泛地交流了勤俭持家的经验。“五好”集体单位代表皮艳群在会上报告了武昌第一纸厂民主九里家属小组开展“五好”活动的收获。她说：这个小组有十六户，在推行“五好”以前，几乎家家用钱都没有计划，欠债和借高利贷的现象很严重，夫妻、婆媳和母女之间也经常因此吵架。推行“五好”以后，全组的人都开始学会了有计划地安排生活，量入为出。两年多来，已完全消除了欠债的现象，大部分人还养成了节约储蓄的习惯。在节约粮、煤、水、电方面也取得了不少成绩，仅今年6月到8月的统计，全组就节约了一百三十七斤粮食和三百五十斤煤，生活却比以前过的好。家庭之间、邻里之间关系也变好了，保证了职工生产不缺勤、回家也能休息好。中共武汉市委交通部干部处处长张信介绍了他和爱人周莲芬（市妇联干部）共同搞好家务的情况。
    两年多来，他一直和爱人一起订生活计划，共同管理家务、教育子女。他们不仅工作得好，家庭生活也过得俭朴、愉快。勤俭持家能手李春培也介绍了她如何在不断提高生活水平的条件下，继续坚持勤俭持家的情况。她的丈夫在近年来工资有了不少增长，她根据工资增加的情况，适当地改善了生活，增加了一定的文娱费和伙食费，但仍然保持着艰苦朴素的作风，尽量地节省粮、棉布、煤、水和电，粮和棉布票经常都有节余上缴，做到了不乱花一个钱，不浪费一点东西。
    中共武汉市委书记李尔重到会作了报告，他号召大家提高社会主义思想觉悟，深入、广泛地推行“五好”，建立更多的社会主义家庭。武汉市妇联主任李冬青也在会上作了报告。
