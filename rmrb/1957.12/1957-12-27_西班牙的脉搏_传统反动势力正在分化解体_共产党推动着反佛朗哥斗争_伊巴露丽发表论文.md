Xinhua News Agency, December 26th dispatch from Paris: The Paris weekly "New France" recently published an article by Dolores Ibárruri, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Spain, on the Spanish political situation and the party's policies, entitled: "How to Accelerate Franco's Collapse?"

The article first points out that the contradiction between the needs of the current Spanish political system and social development has reached the point where not only opposition forces are demanding democratic reforms, but also within the ruling group, there are certain obvious signs indicating that it is no longer possible to rule in the same way as before.

In the hope of continuing to maintain his dictatorship, Franco is striving to unite various traditional reactionary forces with the prospect of a monarchy. However, these forces are undergoing a process of internal division and disintegration, and they no longer have a mass base among peasants and the petty bourgeoisie, because the masses have already moved in a progressive direction. Therefore, "attempts to rely on the most decadent forces for a deathbed struggle have no hope of success."

The article points out that, for the above reasons, the Communist Party's call for the unity of all anti-Franco forces has been extremely well received in all social classes and strata in Spain. The trend advocating that the right and left wings reach an understanding to promote the transition from fascism to political freedom and peace is rising.

At the same time, the article points out that there are still considerable obstacles to reaching an agreement between the right and left wings to oppose Franco. This is because: First, some of the opposition to the Franco regime are wavering, fearing the consequences of Spain's democratic development, and have not yet broken decisively with Franco; Second, some people are trying to exclude the Communist Party and reach an agreement with the non-communist left, thereby preserving the fundamental interests of large monopoly groups and large landowners; Third, some Socialist Party leaders have adopted an anti-national and anti-democratic attitude, and in their view, the main enemy is not Franco but the Communist Party.

In response to this situation, the article puts forward the tasks of the Communist Party of Spain. It says that the Communist Party will currently strive to achieve the following goal: a peaceful transition to democracy, and the realization of bourgeois democratic reforms in Spain. It advocates that all anti-Franco forces reach a political agreement and consult with each other, while each party and group will maintain its own face and independence.

The article then points out that the entire process of unity of the broad anti-Franco forces that are developing in Spain is by no means a spontaneous phenomenon, but is driven by the working class, which is promoting and leading the movement of all anti-Franco forces in the country with its own struggle. The article says that, for this reason, the Communist Party of Spain has always emphasized the need to strive for the unity of the working class.

    西班牙的脉搏
    传统反动势力正在分化解体
    共产党推动着反佛朗哥斗争
    伊巴露丽发表论文
    据新华社26日讯　巴黎消息：巴黎“新法兰西”周刊不久前刊载了一篇西班牙共产党总书记伊巴露丽论西班牙政局和党的政策的文章，题目是：“怎样加速佛朗哥的崩溃？”
    文章首先指出，目前西班牙政治制度和社会发展的需要之间的矛盾已经到了这种程度：不仅反对力量要求民主改革，而且在统治集团内部的高级人士中也出现了某些明显迹象，表明已经不可能用原来的方式照常进行统治。
    由于希望继续维持独裁统治，佛朗哥正力求用君主制度的前景来团结各种传统反动势力。但是，这些势力的内部正在经历着分化和解体的过程，而且它们在农民和中小资产阶级中已经不再有群众基础，因为群众已经向进步的方向前进。因此，“想依靠最腐朽的力量作垂死挣扎的尝试，丝毫没有成功的希望”。
    文章指出，由于上述原因，共产党要求一切反佛朗哥力量团结起来的呼吁在西班牙一切社会阶级和阶层中得到了极为良好的反应。主张右派和左派取得谅解以促成由法西斯主义向政治自由与和平过渡的潮流正日益高涨。
    同时，文章指出，在右派和左派取得协议来反对佛朗哥方面，目前也仍然存在着相当大的障碍。这是因为：一、佛朗哥政权的反对派中有一部分人动摇不定，他们畏惧西班牙民主发展的后果，因而还没有同佛朗哥断然决裂；二、有些人试图排斥共产党而同非共产党左派达成协议，从而保全大垄断集团和大地主的根本利益；三、某些社会党领导人采取了反民族反民主的态度，在他们看来，主要敌人不是佛朗哥而是共产党。
    文章针对这种情况，提出西班牙共产党的任务。它说，共产党在目前将努力要求达到下面这个目标：向民主和平过渡，在西班牙实现资产阶级民主改革。它主张，一切反佛朗哥的力量达成政治协议，彼此进行协商，而同时每个党派和集团又将保持自己的面貌和独立。
    文章接着指出，在西班牙国内正在发展着的广大反佛朗哥力量的团结的整个过程，绝不是一种自发现象，而是以工人阶级作为原动力的，工人阶级正在以自己的斗争推动着和领导着全国一切反佛朗哥力量的运动。文章说，为此，西班牙共产党一直强调必须争取工人阶级的团结。
