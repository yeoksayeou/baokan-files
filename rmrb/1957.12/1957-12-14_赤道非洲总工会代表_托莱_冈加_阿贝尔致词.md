Comrades, dear brothers:

    From this platform, I extend my warmest congratulations to all the representatives on behalf of the workers of Equatorial Africa. This congratulation is not the usual greeting between two comrades meeting at a crossroads. The congratulations I express here have a profound meaning. Because in the history of our country, this congratulation has forged new friendships. In fact, this is the first time that Equatorial Africa has sent a representative to China to participate in such a conference. I take this opportunity to thank the organizers of this important event, the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, for their thoughtful consideration in inviting me to attend this conference on behalf of such a small country. First of all, on behalf of my country, I thank the Chinese people for their warm and cordial hospitality. If I was a few days late in attending this great gathering, dear comrades, please forgive me. This was due to climatic conditions: the plane could not take off in Prague and Moscow due to fog.

    Regarding the main purpose that brings us together in Beijing, Chinese representatives and guests, please don't think that I will talk to you about socialism. The workers of Equatorial Africa are not allowed to know the word socialism, although a few of them are trying hard to understand it. They are not even allowed to mention the word, because they risk losing their lives. To give you a typical example: although this conference very much hoped to see Comrade Julien Boukambou, Secretary-General of the General Confederation of Labor, attend in person, and despite his good wishes and great desire to visit this great and beautiful country with a population of 600 million, he was unable to come. Because the government refused to issue him a visa. In fact, getting a visa is very easy, but when it comes to a member of a democratic organization, it is absolutely impossible!

    I admit that I do not know what life was like for the Chinese people during the foreign occupation. But I tell you, dear comrades, that the oppression suffered by the workers of Equatorial Africa today is so brutal that it is manifested in every aspect: white people live in areas with paved roads and electric lights; black people live in areas full of mud and without lights. As for wages, it is even more shameful. A black African who is very familiar with his work and has eight to ten years of experience can only get the highest position of foreman, and his salary is only 10,000 francs. A white person who often does not work due to lack of skills, pretends to be supervising, and gets 60,000 to 80,000 francs at the end of the month, not to mention the additional housing, car, and water and electricity costs provided. Among the clerks, a white girl who has only worked for fifteen days and spends all day dressing up gets a salary of 30,000 to 40,000 francs. A black accountant, who has worked for five to seven years and has to support five or six young children, gets a salary of 12,000 to 15,000 francs. These examples are too numerous to mention, and they happen every day. You cannot imagine how surprised I was when I heard at this conference that your wages are increasing year by year. Our wages have been completely frozen since 1952.

    Today, the crisis in our country has lasted for more than five years, and two-thirds of the workers are unemployed, and therefore lack housing and food, etc.

    Many children wander the streets. You may ask me: why don't they go to school? Poor children, they may have been to school, but for one reason or another, they had to drop out. This is the simple situation. I am introducing it very simply, because it would not be enough to say it all day long. I was also going to talk about the suffering of the people of Equatorial Africa under French rule.

    In terms of struggle, although our movement is still very young, it is advancing by leaps and bounds thanks to the experience gained by comrades who have been invited to developed countries such as the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and the great China where I am now. Thanks to the material assistance given to us by the World Federation of Trade Unions, we publish a small newspaper, "Solidarity," to educate the masses.

    Our greatest victory was the passage of the Overseas Labor Code in the French National Assembly. Here, I must pay tribute to the French Communist Party, which made a huge contribution to this victory. Since the birth of this precious document, the people of Equatorial Africa have enjoyed the benefits of family allowances. Several decrees have been signed or are being signed.

    The people of Black Africa are aware of their struggle tasks. With these social improvements, and under the teaching of workers in industrialized countries like yours, they hope that one day they will be able to talk about socialism and Marxism-Leninism with you, just like you.

    Long live the solidarity of workers all over the world!

    Long live world peace and the friendship of the people of all countries!

    Long live the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions!

    Please allow me now to present a gift to the conference. This gift is very meager, but it has a very special meaning. My gift is small, the gift is my heart.

    Thank you.

### 赤道非洲总工会代表  托莱—冈加·阿贝尔致词

    赤道非洲总工会代表
    托莱—冈加·阿贝尔致词亲爱的同志们，亲爱的兄弟们：
    我在这个讲坛上，代表赤道非洲工人向全体代表致以最友好的祝贺。这个祝贺，不是平常两个同志在十字路口见面时的寒暄。我在这里所表示的祝贺，有深刻的意义。因为在我国历史上，这个祝贺结成了新的友谊。事实上，这是赤道非洲第一次派代表来中国参加这样的大会。我趁此机会，感谢这一重大事情的组织者中华全国总工会执行委员会，感谢它周到地考虑到邀请我在这里代表这样一个小国家出席这次大会。我首先是代表我的国家，感谢中国人民对我的热情和亲切的招待。如果我参加这次伟大的集会晚了几天，亲爱的同志请原谅我，这是因为，气候条件的关系：由于有雾，飞机不能在布拉格和莫斯科起飞。
    关于使我们在北京集会的主要目的，中国的代表们和各位来宾们，我得告诉你们，不要以为我会同你们谈社会主义。赤道非洲的工人是不允许知道社会主义这一个字的，尽管他们当中有少许几个人正极力想认识它，他们甚至连提这一个字都不行，因为有失去生命的危险。我举一个典型的例子：虽然这次代表大会很希望看到总工会书记朱利安·布加布同志亲自来参加，尽管他有很好的愿望，非常想访问这个拥有六亿人口的伟大而美丽的国家，但是，他不能来。因为政府拒绝发给他签证。其实，领到签证是十分容易的，但当涉及到一个民主组织的成员时，那就绝对不行！
    我承认我不知道中国人民在外国占领时期的生活情况。但我告诉你们，亲爱的同志们，目前赤道非洲工人所遭受的压迫是如此的粗暴，它表现在各个方面：白人住在有柏油路和电灯的地区；黑人住在尽是烂泥和没有灯光的地区。至于说到工资，这更令人感到羞耻。一个非常熟悉他的工作、有八年到十年工龄的黑种非洲人，他所能得到的最高职务是工头，而所得的工资只有一万法郎。一个由于没有技术而经常不工作的白人，他装作是在进行监工的样子，到月底就拿六万到八万法郎，而且另外供给的住宅、汽车和水电的费用还不算在内。在职员中，一个才工作十五天、而且整天都只忙于打扮的白种姑娘，她所得的工资是三万到四万法郎。而一个黑种人的会计员，工作了五年到七年，还要养活五、六个小孩子，所得的工资却是一万二千至一万五千法郎。这些例子不胜列举，而且都是每天实际发生的事情。你们不能想像，当我在这次大会上听到你们的工资逐年增加时，我是多么的吃惊。我们的工资从1952年起就完全被冻结了。
    到今天，我们国土上的危机已经延续了五年以上，三分之二的工人没有职业，因而也就缺乏住房和食物等等。
    许多儿童在城里游荡。你们会问我：为什么他们不上学呢？可怜的孩子们，他们可能进过学校，但是由于这种或那种理由，他们不得不停学。这就是简单的情况。我介绍的非常简单，因为要全说了的话，一整天的时间也不够。我本来还要谈谈法国统治下的赤道非洲人民的遭遇。
    在斗争方面，虽然我们的运动还非常年轻，但是由于被邀请到过发达的国家，如苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚和现在我所来到的伟大中国的一些同志们所获得的经验，它们在大踏步地前进着。由于世界工联给予我们物质援助，我们出版了一种小报纸“团结报”来教育群众。
    我们获得的最大的胜利，是在法国国民议会中通过了海外地区的劳工法典。在这里，我应该向法国共产党致敬，它对这个胜利作了巨大的贡献。自从这个宝贵的文件诞生以后，赤道非洲的人民就享受着家庭补助金的好处。好几种法令已经签订或正在签订中。
    黑非洲的人民认识到了他们的斗争任务。随着这些社会性的改进，在你们实行工业化国家工人的教导下，他们希望有一天，也能像你们一样地同你们在一起谈社会主义和马克思列宁主义。
    全世界工人团结万岁！
    世界和平和各国人民的友谊万岁！
    中国工会第八次全国代表大会万岁！
    请允许我现在向大会献礼。这个礼物很菲薄，但是，它有非常特殊的意义。我的礼物很小，这个礼物就是我的心。
    谢谢。
