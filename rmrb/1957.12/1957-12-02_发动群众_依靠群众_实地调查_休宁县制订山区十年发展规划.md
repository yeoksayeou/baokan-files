Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 30th -- Xiuning County, Anhui Province, mobilized the masses and formulated a ten-year plan for developing mountainous area production from the bottom up. This plan requires that by 1967, the county's forest land area will be expanded from the current 1,080,000 mu to 2,020,000 mu; grain output will increase from more than 120 million jin to more than 260 million jin; the number of large livestock such as cattle, horses, donkeys, and mules will increase from more than 15,600 to more than 84,300; the number of pigs will increase from 74,000 to 164,000; and the total output value of other sideline production will increase from more than 1.96 million yuan to more than 4.21 million yuan. After the implementation of this plan, the average annual net income per person in the county will increase from 113 yuan to 219 yuan.

Xiuning County is a mountainous county with abundant land and resources but a small population. In addition to grain crops, it is rich in bamboo, wood, tea, livestock, and hundreds of kinds of local specialty products. At present, there are still more than 1 million mu of land in the county suitable for planting trees and tea, lying barren; the potential of the land that has been utilized has not been brought into play, and some utilization is unreasonable, causing soil erosion. There are many small local specialty products in the mountainous areas, and some have not yet been developed. Mountainous areas have abundant feed and natural pastures, and there is great potential for developing animal husbandry.

Based on these conditions, the plan requires the implementation of the policy of focusing on the development of forestry (including tea) in mountainous areas. By 1965, all barren mountains and wastelands should be greened, more than 700,000 mu of timber forest should be developed, "oil crops on the mountains" should be promoted, more than 100,000 mu of oil tea and more than 30,000 mu of tung trees should be planted, and fruit trees should be vigorously developed. Continue to reclaim barren tea gardens, and open up 30,000 mu of new tea gardens, with output increasing from more than 35,000 dan this year to more than 120,000 dan by 1967. Grain production, based on the characteristics of the mountainous areas with little arable land, focuses on increasing the yield per unit area, and appropriately developing arable land area while maintaining soil and water. The plan requires that by 1962, the average yield per mu of cultivated land will be increased from the current 499 jin to 808 jin, and to 997 jin by 1967. In order to ensure the completion of grain production targets, individual plans have been made for soil and water conservation and water conservancy projects, and carrying out manure accumulation work.

In terms of developing animal husbandry, the plan requires that by 1967, each household will raise an average of two cattle and nearly four pigs. It will also tap the potential of various small local specialty products and sideline production such as papermaking and lime burning, expand varieties, and increase the total output value by one time by 1967.

When carrying out the ten-year plan for mountainous area production, Xiuning County vigorously mobilized the masses. Mountainous farmers almost ran all over every hillside in the county, conducted on-the-spot surveys, and put forward many opinions. Throughout the entire planning process, it has been repeatedly discussed by the masses, so the planning is relatively detailed, and the masses also have confidence in completing the various targets in the plan. At present, the county's farmers have begun to take action, and the task of collecting more than 30,000 jin of oil tea, tung oil, and pine seeds needed for forestry development has been overfulfilled. Now they are collecting fir seeds. In order to open up tea gardens, farmers have picked more than 70,000 jin of tea seeds. Production activities such as afforestation and tea planting have been carried out ahead of schedule. In order to increase grain output and expand the multiple cropping index, more than 60,000 mu of mid-season crops have been sown throughout the county, which is nearly doubled compared with last year. The earthwork planned for water conservancy projects throughout the county this year exceeds the total earthwork done since liberation.

　　休宁县制订山区十年发展规划
    新华社合肥30日电　安徽省休宁县发动群众，自下而上地制订出发展山区生产的十年规划。这个规划要求到1967年，全县林地面积由现有一百零八万多亩扩大到二百零二万多亩；粮食产量由一亿二千多万斤增加到二亿六千多万斤；牛、马、驴、骡等大牲畜由一万五千六百多头增加到八万四千三百多头；猪由七万四千头增加到十六万四千头；其他副业生产总值由一百九十六万多元增加到四百二十一万多元。这个规划实现后，全县每人全年平均纯收入将由一百一十三元增加到二百一十九元。
    休宁县是个山区县，地多人少，物产丰富，除粮食作物外，盛产竹木、茶叶、牲畜及数百种土特产品。目前这个县还有一百多万亩适合种树、植茶的土地荒芜着；已利用的土地潜力也没有发挥，有的利用不合理，造成水土流失。山区的小土特产很多，有的现在还没有经营起来。山区饲料多，有天然牧场，发展畜牧业也有很大潜力。
    根据这些条件，规划要求贯彻山区以发展林业（包括茶叶）为主的方针，到1965年把荒山荒地全部绿化，发展用材林七十多万亩，提倡“油料上山”，增植油茶十万亩，油桐三万多亩，大力发展果树；继续垦复荒茶园，并开辟新茶园三万亩，产量由今年的三万五千多担到1967年增加到十二万多担。粮食生产根据山区宜耕地少的特点，着重提高单位面积产量，在保持水土的原则下适当发展耕地面积。规划要求在1962年把耕地平均每亩产量由现在的四百九十九斤提高到八百零八斤，到1967年增加到九百九十七斤。为保证完成粮食生产指标，对水土保持和水利工程、开展积肥工作等措施，都作了单项规划。
    在发展畜牧业方面，规划要求到1967年平均每户养牛二头，养猪近四头。并挖掘各种小土特产和造纸、烧石灰等副业生产的潜力，扩大品种，到1967年把总产值提高一倍。
    休宁县在进行山区生产十年规划时，大力发动了群众，山区农民几乎跑遍了全县每一个山坡，实地进行了踏查，并提出了很多意见。在整个规划过程中，都反复经过群众讨论，所以规划得比较细致，群众对完成规划中的各项指标也有了信心。目前全县农民已开始行动起来，为发展林业需要的三万多斤油茶、油桐、松树种籽的采集任务，已超额完成。现在又正在采集杉树种。为开辟茶园，农民们已采摘了茶籽七万多斤。造林、种茶等生产活动都已提前进行。为提高粮食产量，扩大复种指数，全县现已播种了午季作物六万多亩，比去年扩大了近一倍。今年全县计划兴修水利工程的土方，超过了解放几年来所作土方的总和。
