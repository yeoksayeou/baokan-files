　　Fog
　　Autumn Wind
　　In the autumn and winter seasons, when you open the door early in the morning and look outside, you often see a vast fog, enveloping the earth like an ocean. Experienced people will say, "Today will be good weather."
　　So, how is fog formed? It, like clouds, is formed by water vapor in the air condensing into tiny droplets. Those floating high in the sky become clouds, and those suspended near the ground become fog. You could say that clouds are fog in the sky, and fog is clouds on the ground; they are "two-in-one" natural phenomena.
　　However, considering their environment and the weather they reflect, clouds and fog are clearly different. Clouds are formed by unstable weather conditions, with rising air currents cooling and condensing, so cloudy weather often brings rain. As the ancients said, "Clouds bring rain," which is the idea. Fog, on the other hand, exists only near the ground and does not require rising air currents for its formation. The weather is stable, so foggy days are often clear and bright. The proverb "Seven fogs, nine clear days" is very accurate.
　　There are many causes of fog, and various types. The most common type in winter is called "radiation fog." It is formed because the sky is clear and cloudless at night, allowing the ground to cool rapidly without obstruction. The air near the ground is also affected, its temperature decreasing, and some of the water vapor condenses. Therefore, to create radiation fog, there must be a clear night with few clouds, allowing the ground to radiate heat quickly, affecting the temperature of the lower air layer and creating a "temperature inversion" [Note]. This maintains the stability of the air flow and prevents convection. Secondly, the air must be very humid, containing a large amount of water vapor. Furthermore, there must be an appropriate weak wind; the wind cannot be too strong, nor can it be completely absent. If it is too strong, it will destroy the temperature inversion; if there is no wind, the fog droplets will fall to the ground. At the same time, there must be a large amount of fine dust in the air, so that water vapor can condense around the dust particles. Only when these conditions are met can radiation fog form.
　　Radiation fog is generally densest in the morning, because this is the coldest time of the day and night, and the amount of water vapor condensing is at its greatest. When the sun rises and the ground warms, the air rises, breaking the temperature inversion, and the fog disappears, followed by clear, good weather. Therefore, there is a proverb that says it well: "Morning fog, sunshine breaks the belly" (meaning the weather will be sunny and warm). In fact, this kind of morning radiation fog is precisely the product of sunny weather.
　　Another common type is "advection fog." It is formed when warm, moist air flows horizontally over a cold surface, causing the temperature to decrease and the water vapor to condense into fog. It does not require as many conditions as radiation fog and does not necessarily appear at a specific time, generally occurring more often during the day.
　　In addition, a blurry, indistinct fog is often seen in river valleys and lake areas, which is a "steam fog" with a unique cause. It is not formed by the cooling of the air, but by the increase of water vapor in the air. When lifting the lid of a pot while cooking, white smoke rises, which is actually a small-scale steam fog. On the surface of rivers and lakes, due to sunlight during the day, the water temperature rises, and a large amount of water vapor flies into the air, also forming steam fog.
　　There are other types such as "expansion fog" and "mixing fog," but because the principles are complicated and not commonly seen, they will not be described further. However, once the causes of fog are understood, short-term weather changes can be grasped.
　　[Note] The atmospheric temperature generally decreases gradually from bottom to top. If a situation of cold below and warm above occurs, it is called a "temperature inversion," or "temperature increase with altitude."

　　雾
　　秋风
    在秋冬的季节里，当你早起开门外望的时候，往往会看到茫茫大雾，如洋似海地笼罩着大地，有经验的人就说：“今天又是好天气”。
    那么，雾是怎样生成的呢？原来它和云一样，都是由于空气中的水蒸气，遇冷凝成的小水滴，飘浮在高空的就成云，悬浮在地面上的便是雾。也可以说云是高空的雾，雾是地面上的云，它们是“两位一体”的自然现象。
    但是，就它们存在的环境和反映出来的天气来看，云和雾则又是显然不同的。云是在天气不稳定，气流上升冷却凝结而成的，所以有云的天气多阴雨。古人云：“云腾致雨”就是这个道理。而雾仅存于地面，生成时不需要空气的对流上升，天气是稳定的，所以有雾天多晴明。谚语“七雾九晴”说的是很对的。
    雾的成因很多，种类不一。我们冬季最常见的一种叫“辐射雾”。它是由于夜晚天空晴朗无云，地面散热无阻而很快冷却，近地面空气也因受到影响而温度降低，一部分水蒸气凝结而成的。所以，要造成辐射雾就必须是晴夜少云，地面能迅速放热，影响低处空气层温度的降低，造成一种“逆温现象”〔注〕，这样，可以保持气流的稳定而不致上下对流；其次是空气必须很潮湿，含有大量的水蒸气；再者，要有适当的弱风，风不能过大，也不能完全没有。过大则使逆温破坏，无风则使雾滴落地。同时，空气中也要有大量的微尘存在，使水蒸气能围绕着尘埃进行凝结。只有当这些条件具备时，才能形成辐射雾。
    辐射雾一般在早晨最浓，因为这是一昼夜中气温最低的时候，水蒸气凝结量最多。当日高地暖，气流上升，打破了逆温现象，雾就随之消失，接着是晴朗好天。所以有个谚语说得很中肯：“清早雾，晒破肚”（言其天晴日暖）。实际上这种清晨的辐射雾，正是晴天的产物。
    常见的另一种是“平流雾”。它是湿暖空气在水平流动经过冷地面的时候，因温度降低而凝结成雾。它不要求像辐射雾那样多的条件，出现的时间也不一定，一般多在白天。
    此外，在河谷湖沼地带，也常见到一种模糊不清的雾，这是一种成因特殊的“蒸气雾”。它不是由于空气的冷却，而是由空气中的水蒸气增加而形成的。做饭时掀起锅盖，白烟上冒，实际上就是一种小型的蒸气雾。在河湖的水面上，由于白天受阳光照射，水温增高，大量水蒸气飞向空中，也形成了蒸气雾。
    其他尚有“膨胀雾”、“混合雾”等多种，因道理繁琐，且不常见，不再赘述。但是当知道了雾的成因之后，就可以掌握短时期内的天气变化了。
    〔注〕大气温度本是自下而上逐渐递减的，如果出现了下冷上暖的局面，叫做“逆温现象”，或者叫“温度逆增”。
