    A New "Trojan Horse" for Aggression in the Middle East
    The United States is Again Manufacturing an "Umbrella Organization"
    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 6th -- Syrian public opinion condemns the United States for instigating the establishment of a group called the "Umbrella Organization."
    According to United Press International, the establishment of this organization is to strengthen the ties between NATO, the Baghdad Pact countries, and other so-called "free countries." Israel will also participate in this organization that the United States is creating.
    Jabri, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Syrian Parliament, said on the 5th that the "Umbrella Organization" is another imperialist organization being manufactured by imperialists led by the United States. He said that although the United States' pursuit of its imperialist plans has repeatedly failed, it still harbors this idea, which I regret. He hopes that the Arabs will carefully watch this new trick.

    侵略中东的新“木马计”
　  美国又在制造“雨伞组织”
    据新华社大马士革6日电　叙利亚舆论谴责美国策动建立一个名为“雨伞组织”的集团。
    据合众社消息说，建立这个组织是为了加强北大西洋公约组织和巴格达条约国家以及其他所谓“自由国家”之间的联系。以色列也将参加美国正在创立的这个组织。
    叙利亚议会外交委员会主席贾布里5日说，“雨伞组织”是以美国为首的帝国主义者正在制造的又一个帝国主义组织。他说，虽然美国推行它的帝国主义计划一再遭到失败，但是它却仍旧怀着这种想法，我对此感到遗憾。他希望阿拉伯人小心地注视这个新的诡计。
