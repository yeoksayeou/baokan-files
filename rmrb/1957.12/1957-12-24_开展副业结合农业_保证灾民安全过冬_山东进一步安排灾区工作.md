Developing Sideline Occupations Combined with Agriculture to Ensure Disaster Victims Can Safely Survive the Winter
Shandong Further Arranges Disaster Area Work

    (Our newspaper's dispatch) The Party and government leaders at all levels in Shandong Province are taking ensuring the safe winter passage of disaster victims as an urgent task at present.

    After the southern regions of Shandong suffered from floods unseen in a century this year, the resettlement work for 1.5 million disaster victims has basically concluded. The People's Government has distributed relief funds and grain, and supported disaster areas in replanting 5.2 million mu of late autumn crops, repaired and built 1.28 million houses, and promptly carried out socialist education. Therefore, the disaster victims have high confidence in overcoming the disaster. According to statistics from mid-November, nearly 13,000 agricultural cooperatives in severely affected areas have formulated plans for self-salvation through production. Sideline production has been widely launched in disaster areas, but at present, the self-salvation through production movement is not well-developed in a few areas; the unified purchase and sale work has not kept up; the distribution of relief funds is not timely and the allocation is not reasonable enough; not all collapsed houses have been repaired; there are still epidemic diseases in disaster areas; and draft animals are weak and forage is insufficient. To this end, the leading departments of Shandong Province have taken the following measures:

    (1) Party and government leaders at all levels are instructed to quickly organize forces, with the agricultural cooperative as a unit, to check the situation of food rations, housing, winter clothing, diseases, and livestock feeding household by household in disaster areas, and solve problems in a timely manner to ensure that disaster victims can eat, have housing, wear cotton clothes, and safely survive the winter.

    (2) Self-salvation through production should be combined with the development of sideline production and winter water conservancy, manure accumulation, soil improvement, and livestock protection production movements.

    (3) The work of issuing grain purchase and sales certificates should be carried out quickly to ensure timely supply, and the distribution of relief funds should be carried out conscientiously.

    (4) Patriotic hygiene and epidemic prevention education should be carried out universally, and epidemic prevention and hygiene work should be done well. A number of medical teams have now been organized to go to disaster areas.

    (5) Strengthen leadership, give play to the role of production and disaster relief organizations, clarify division of labor, strengthen the responsibility system, and keep abreast of the disaster situation in a timely manner. Continue to strengthen socialist political and ideological education for disaster victims and carry out extensive debates. (Xiao Yan)

    开展副业结合农业　保证灾民安全过冬
    山东进一步安排灾区工作
    本报讯　山东省各级党政领导正把保证灾民安全过冬作为当前的一项紧要任务。
    山东南部地区今年遭到百年未遇的洪水侵害后，一百五十万灾民的安置工作，已基本上结束。人民政府发放了救济款、粮食，并支援灾区补种了五百二十万亩晚秋作物，修复和新建一百二十八万间房屋，及时进行了社会主义教育，所以，灾民战胜灾荒的信心很高。据11月中旬统计，重灾区有近一万三千个农业社已订出生产自救计划。灾区的副业生产已普遍开展起来，但目前还有少数地区生产自救运动开展得不好；统销工作跟不上；救济款发放不及时和分配不够合理；倒塌房屋尚未全部修复；灾区还有疫疾；耕畜瘦弱及饲草不足等。为此，山东省领导部门已采取以下措施：
    （一）责成各级党政领导，迅速组织力量，以社为单位，在灾区逐户检查口粮、住房、寒衣、疾病、牲畜饲养等方面情况，发现问题，及时解决，保证灾民都能吃上饭，住上房，穿上棉衣，安全过冬。
    （二）应使生产自救同开展副业生产与冬季水利、积肥、改良土壤、保护耕畜等生产运动相结合。
    （三）迅速进行粮食统销发证工作，保证及时供应，并切实作好发放救济款工作。
    （四）普遍进行爱国防疫卫生教育，作好防疫卫生工作。现已组织了若干医疗队前往灾区。
    （五）加强领导，发挥生产救灾组织的作用，明确分工，加强责任制，及时掌握灾情。继续对灾民加强社会主义的政治思想教育，开展大辩论。　（萧彦）
