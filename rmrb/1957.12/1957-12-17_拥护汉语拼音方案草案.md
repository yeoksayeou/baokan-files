　　Supporting the Draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme
　　Easy to Learn, Easy to Write
　　The draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme has been published, which is a great joyous event in the cultural life of the people nationwide. The publication of this draft will play an active role in improving Chinese language teaching in schools, promoting Mandarin Chinese, and eliminating illiteracy.
　　After the Chinese Writing Reform Committee published the first draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, our Xisi District Cultural Center, with the strong support of the District People's Committee, successively organized fifteen Chinese phonetic alphabet experiment classes, with more than seven hundred participants, including government cadres, literacy teachers, and workers, most of whom had elementary and junior high school education levels. After twenty hours of learning, more than 96% of the people basically mastered the Chinese phonetic alphabet tool. Literacy teacher Wang Huizhen learned the phonetic alphabet in only eighteen hours. Literacy teacher Qian Mengjie not only learned the phonetic alphabet herself, but also taught it to her husband and children. She often used the phonetic alphabet to write notes on the bulletin boards in parks and cinemas. Therefore, the Chinese phonetic alphabet is a scientific writing tool that is easy to learn, easy to write, and easy to master. I enthusiastically support the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme and am willing to make the greatest possible effort in promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet.

　　Vigorously Promote
　　After seeing the draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme and the articles by Mr. Wu Yuzhang and Mr. Li Jinxi in the "People's Daily," we were all very happy and fully support this draft.
　　The draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is very suitable for the current needs of the broad masses and is easy to learn. It will play a significant role in annotating Chinese characters, promoting Mandarin Chinese, and eliminating illiteracy. Soon we will be graduating, and after returning to our respective provinces and cities, we must vigorously promote the draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, so that everyone knows about it and can learn it.

　　Helping My Spouse Learn
　　I warmly welcome the publication of the new draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme and fully agree with the revisions to the original draft. The draft's explanation states, "Promoting the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is used to annotate Chinese characters, help teach Chinese characters, unify pronunciation, and promote Mandarin Chinese." This is very necessary. Take the eight people in our room as an example, there are seven different tones. If you say he doesn't understand, he says you don't understand. Such lack of unified language directly affects the expression of thoughts and feelings and the exchange of experiences, and it also directly affects the ability of the Chinese language and writing to be better grasped by the people and to better serve our country's socialist construction. I often don't speak because others don't understand me, and I don't discuss things with comrades that I should, which directly affects the growth of knowledge. I am determined to learn the phonetic alphabet and learn Mandarin Chinese well. Now I have asked a classmate who speaks Mandarin to be my teacher.
　　I am also glad that I once again have a reason to persuade my family to learn culture. My spouse often refuses to learn culture and the phonetic alphabet because of the poor reading, writing, and usage of certain characters in the past draft. The new draft does not have these shortcomings, so she has no excuse. My confidence in helping her learn culture is even greater.

### 拥护汉语拼音方案草案

　　拥护汉语拼音方案草案
    容易学、容易写
    汉语拼音方案草案已经公布了，这是全国人民文化生活中的一件大喜事。这个草案的公布，对改进学校语文教学，推广普通话和扫除文盲，都将起积极的推动作用。
    中国文字改革委员会发表了第一个汉语拼音方案草案以后，我们西四区文化馆在区人民委员会的大力支持下，先后组织了十五个汉语拼音字母试验班，共有机关干部、扫盲教员和工人等七百多人参加学习，这些人大都具有小学和初中的文化水平。通过二十个小时的学习，96％以上的人基本上掌握了汉语拼音字母这套工具。扫盲教员王慧珍仅十八个小时，就学会了拼音字母。扫盲教员钱孟杰不仅自己学会了拼音字母，而且也教会了她的爱人和孩子。她在公园和电影院的留言板上，常用拼音字母来写留下的话。所以说，汉语拼音字母是一套易学、易写而又容易掌握的科学的文字工具。我热烈地拥护汉语拼音方案，并愿在汉语拼音字母的宣传工作中，作出最大限度的努力。
        北京市西四区文化馆　孙学玉
    大力宣传
    我们在“人民日报”上，看到了汉语拼音方案草案和吴玉章、黎锦熙先生的文章后，都非常高兴，完全拥护这个草案。
    汉语拼音方案草案很适合当前广大群众的需要，而且便于学习。它对汉字注音、推广普通话和扫除文盲都将起很大的作用。不久我们就要结业了，回到各省市以后，我们一定要大力宣传汉语拼音方案草案，使每个人都知道，并且能学会它。
          普通话语音研究班　屈庆富
    帮助爱人学习
    我热烈欢迎汉语拼音方案新草案的公布，完全同意对原草案的修正。草案说明所说，“推行汉语拼音方案，用来为汉字注音，帮助教学汉字、统一读音和推广普通话。”这是很必要的。就以我们房间八个人来说，就有七个不同的声调，你说他不懂，他说你不懂。这样语言不统一，直接影响着思想感情的表达和经验的交流，也直接影响着使汉语和文字能更好地为人民所掌握，更好地为我国社会主义建设服务。我经常因自己说话别人不懂而不说，该和同志们研究的没有研究，这就直接影响着知识的增长。我决心学会拼音字母，学好普通话。现在我已请会说普通话的同学当先生。
    我还感到高兴的是，我再次有理由说服我的家人去学文化。我的爱人常以过去草案中某些字的读、写、用法不好而不学文化，不学拼音。新草案没有这些缺点，她没理由了。我帮助她学习文化的信心更大了。
