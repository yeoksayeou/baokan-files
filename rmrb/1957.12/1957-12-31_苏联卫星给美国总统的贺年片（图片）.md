    A New Year's Card from the Soviet Satellite to the American President
    Hua Junwu (drawing) Yuan Shuipai (poem)
    Respected Mr. President: Happy New Year!
    Wishing the American people happiness in the new year,
    Wishing American generals would behave themselves.
    Wishing you, Mr. President, good luck in the new year,
    And not be as crestfallen as you were in 1957.
    May your satellites also go to heaven next year,
    And not be defeated by the "Vanguard" again.
    Wishing humanity to compete in peaceful creation,
    And no longer waste wealth on the arms race.
    We welcome our American little brother,
    To come and live with us in the sky as well.
    The idea of peaceful coexistence is not only popular all over the world,
    Along the way, we encountered meteoroids from outer space,
    They all said it has spread throughout the entire galaxy.
    —Your faithful Sputnik brothers

    苏联卫星给美国总统的贺年片
    华君武画  袁水拍诗
    尊敬的总统先生：恭贺新禧！
    祝美国人民新年幸福，
    祝美国将军们安分守己。
    祝您总统先生新年运气好，
    不再像1957年那样垂头丧气。
    愿你们的卫星来年也能上天，
    别再给“先锋”号弄得一败涂地。
    祝人类在和平创造上争奇斗胜，
    不再在军备竞赛上耗费财力。
    我们欢迎我们的美国小弟弟，
    也来到空中和我们生活在一起。
    和平共处的思想不仅流行世界各地，
    一路上我们碰到天外飞来的流星，
    都说它已经传遍了整个银河系。
    ——你忠实的斯普特尼克两兄弟
