Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 1st: Cadres from provincial-level organs in Shandong Province and the cities of Jinan and Qingdao are actively mobilizing their family members to return to the countryside for production. As of mid-November, over 1,100 family members of staff from provincial-level and Jinan city-level organs have returned to their hometowns and enthusiastically joined the agricultural labor front. Another 2,700 plus have expressed their intention to return to the countryside for production by the Spring Festival at the latest. On November 23rd, Party and mass organizations in Qingdao held a grand meeting to bid farewell to 148 households of cadres' family members returning to the countryside for production.

In mobilizing cadres' family members to return to the countryside, all organs have fully conducted debates to ensure the family members return consciously and voluntarily. At the same time, many leading cadres have taken the lead and set an example. Li Delin, Deputy Minister of the Culture and Education Department of the Jinan Municipal Party Committee, recently mobilized his own younger sister to return to the countryside. Wang Lianke, Deputy Director of the Personnel Department of the Provincial Department of Commerce, originally planned to move his entire family to Jinan. Recently, he not only cancelled this plan but also sent his wife, who was originally living in Jinan, back to the countryside.

    山东省级机关干部
　　动员家属回乡生产
    新华社济南1日电　山东省省级机关和济南、青岛两市的机关干部纷纷动员家属回乡生产。到11月中旬止，省级和济南市级机关已有工作人员家属一千一百多人先后还乡，愉快地走上了农业劳动战线；另有二千七百多人表示至迟在春节前回乡生产。青岛市党群机关在11月23日举行大会，欢送一百四十八户干部家属回乡生产。
    各机关在动员干部家属回乡中都充分开展辩论，使回乡家属自觉自愿。同时，许多领导干部都以身作则，起了带头作用。中共济南市委文教部副部长李德霖，不久前动员自己的妹妹回到农村。省商业厅人事处副处长王连科，原打算把全家搬到济南来住，最近他不仅取消了这一打算，而且还把他原来住在济南的爱人也送回了农村。
