    "Unchangeable" System
    He Huaxin, Customer of the Xia Gong Fu Canteen, Beijing

    Recently, it is said that under the guidance of the Beijing Food Company, some canteens have implemented a new system: waiters charge customers immediately after delivering the food. It is also said that the reason for implementing this new system is that some customers used to slip away without paying in the confusion after eating. In this way, those who want to sneak away naturally cannot, which can be said to be the only advantage of the new system. However, new problems have arisen. The time waiters spend on charging, calculating bills, and making change is much more than the time they spend on serving food. Customers are anxiously shouting, and the food in the kitchen is getting cold, but it cannot be served. As a result, arguments between customers and waiters have increased, and the order is even more chaotic. Customers suggested they change this method, but the waiters said that the food company wanted it this way, and they were not willing either, but it couldn't be changed.
    Since there have been people who have slipped away without paying, I dare not advise the food company to blindly trust the majority of customers, because the minority is indeed contained within the majority. However, I believe that many solutions can be devised. The implementation of a method should be weighed for its advantages and disadvantages. Is the advantage greater, or is the disadvantage greater? If it is not possible to seek perfection, then the one with greater advantage and smaller disadvantage should be chosen. In my opinion, this new system is more disadvantageous than advantageous.
    I am not opposed to trying any new method in order to find the correct solution, even if it proves to be harmful after the trial. It is precisely because we do not know its advantages and disadvantages that we conduct the trial! But once the trial proves it to be bad, we must immediately find a way to change it. The idea of "cannot be changed" is wrong. We Chinese have a saying that "no matter how useless a person is, he cannot be allowed to be憋死 (die from holding in urine)." Are the comrades in those canteens and the leaders of the food company really going to be limited to death by this bad method?
    I would like to see the change of this method, especially the overcoming of this "cannot be changed" thinking.

### “变不得”的制度

    “变不得”的制度
    北京霞公府食堂顾客　何华新
    最近，据说是在北京市食品公司的指导下，有些食堂实行了一种新制度：服务员把饭端给顾客以后，立即收费。又据说，所以实行这种新制度，是由于过去有些顾客吃饭以后，趁混乱不开钱，就溜掉。这样，想溜的人自然是溜不掉了，这可说是新制度的唯一好处。然而，却发生了新的问题，服务员花在收费、算账、找账的时间，要比花在端饭上的时间多得多。顾客急得哇哇叫，厨房里的饭也都放冷了，就是端不出。于是顾客同服务员之间的争吵增多了，秩序更加混乱了。顾客建议他们改变这方法，服务员却说是食品公司要这样的，他们也并不愿意，然而变不得。
    既然有过不开钱溜掉的人，我也就不敢奉劝食品公司盲目的信任顾客中的多数。因为少数确实也包含在多数之中的。然而，我却认为办法可以想出许多种，一种办法的实行，又该权衡其利害，是利大呢还是害大？倘不能求全，也该取其利大弊小者，依我看这种新制度是弊大利小的。
    我又不反对为了找到正确的办法而试用任何新办法，即使经过试行证明它是有害的也好，正因为不知其利弊才作试行的呀！但一经试验证明其不好以后，便须立即设法改变，“变不得”的思想是不对的。我们中国人有句俗话，说是“人再没有出息，也不能叫尿蹩死”。难道那些食堂的同志以及食品公司的领导者，就真的要被这种坏办法限死吗？
    我愿意看到这办法的改变，尤其是这“变不得”的思想的克服。
