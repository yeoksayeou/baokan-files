　　Ifni Insurgents Advance on Capital
    Morocco Protests Spanish Violation of Territorial Waters

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: According to reports, the Ifni uprising people continue to make progress in their fight against the Spanish colonial army. The Ifni uprising army communique, published on the 9th in the Moroccan Independence Party's organ "Al Alam," stated that the uprising people are taking advantage of their victories to expand their positions on the outskirts of the capital, Sidi Ifni, and are preparing to launch an attack on this last major stronghold controlled by the Spanish colonialists at any time.
    The communique also stated that since December 1st, the Ifni uprising people have killed a total of 190 Spanish colonial officers and soldiers, wounded dozens, and captured 19 in battle.
    After suffering successive defeats, the Spanish colonial army is continuously retaliating against the peaceful residents of Ifni. The Spanish Air Force has been bombing residential areas in the liberated areas of Ifni for days.
    On December 8th, the Moroccan government dispatched a Royal Army carrying dozens of artillery pieces to the southern Moroccan port of Agadir to strengthen local defenses in order to cope with possible provocations by the Spanish army.
    Sources say that because Ifni itself has no port, the Spanish colonial army is attempting to force a landing at the Moroccan port of Agadir in order to transport reinforcements and supplies to Sidi Ifni, the capital city forty miles south that is surrounded by the Ifni uprising people. It is reported that eight Spanish warships patrolled outside the port of Agadir all day on the 7th, and five more were added on the 8th. Currently, the Moroccan Royal Army has taken up positions and is monitoring the movements of the Spanish fleet.
    On the 7th, the Moroccan government ordered the Moroccan ambassador to Madrid to lodge a strong protest with the Spanish government regarding the Spanish warships' violation of Moroccan territorial waters.
    However, the Spanish government, enraged by the blows of the Ifni uprising people, not only ignored Morocco's protest, but also sent a note to the Moroccan government on the 8th, threatening to take "all necessary measures" against Morocco if it continues to aid the Ifni insurgents.
    Prince Moulay Hassan read a speech delivered to the nation by the King of Morocco, who is currently visiting the United States, on the radio on the evening of the 9th. In his speech, he accused the Spanish fleet's action of violating Moroccan territorial waters as "infringing upon recognized national rights." The King of Morocco called on the people to remain calm in the face of Spain's "actions infringing upon us" and demanded that the people leave the entire Ifni issue to him to resolve.

### 伊夫尼义军进迫首都  摩洛哥抗议西班牙侵犯领海

　　伊夫尼义军进迫首都
    摩洛哥抗议西班牙侵犯领海
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：伊夫尼起义人民在反抗西班牙殖民军的战斗中继续获得进展。9日刊登在摩洛哥独立党机关报“旗帜报”上的伊夫尼起义军公报说，起义人民正在乘胜扩大它在首府西迪·伊夫尼外围的阵地，准备随时发动对西班牙殖民者控制下的这个最后主要据点的进攻。
    公报还说，自从12月1日以来，伊夫尼起义人民在战斗中总共打死西班牙殖民军官兵一百九十人，打伤数十人，俘虏十九人。
    西班牙殖民军在接连遭到挫败后，正在不断对伊夫尼和平居民滥施报复。西班牙空军连日轰炸伊夫尼已解放地区内的居民点。
    摩洛哥政府8日派遣一支王室陆军携带数十门大炮前往摩洛哥南部港口阿加迪尔增强当地防务，以便应付西班牙军队可能的挑衅。
    有消息说，由于伊夫尼本身没有港口，西班牙殖民军企图在阿加迪尔这个摩洛哥港口实行强迫登陆，以便把援兵和物资运往四十英里以南被伊夫尼起义人民包围的首府西迪·伊夫尼。据报道，7日有八艘西班牙军舰在阿加迪尔港外巡逻了一整天，8日又增加了五艘。目前摩洛哥王室军队已经进入阵地，正在监视西班牙舰队的动静。
    摩洛哥政府已经在7日命令摩洛哥驻马德里大使就西班牙军舰侵犯摩洛哥领海事向西班牙政府提出强硬抗议。
    但是，在伊夫尼起义人民打击下老羞成怒的西班牙政府不但不理会摩洛哥的抗议，反而在8日照会摩洛哥政府，威胁说要对摩洛哥“采取一切必要措施”，假如摩洛哥继续援助伊夫尼起义者。
    穆莱·哈桑王储9日晚间在广播中宣读了正在美国访问的摩洛哥国王向全国发表的一篇演讲词。他在演讲中指责西班牙舰队侵犯摩洛哥领水的行动是“侵犯了公认的国家权利”。摩洛哥国王号召人民在面临西班牙“侵犯我们的行动”的时候保持冷静，并且要求人民把全部伊夫尼问题留给他自己去解决。
