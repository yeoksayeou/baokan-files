　　Unbelievable!

    Good News
    "Ha! Good news!" Old Xia burst into the room, walking and shouting. He immediately waved the newspaper, reporting like a propagandist, "Today, the State Council issued interim regulations on retirement, resignation, home visits, and apprentice subsidies."
    Before he could finish, everyone swarmed around. One newspaper wasn't enough! Someone suggested buying a few more. Little Yao volunteered to buy them.
    Little Yao was too late, and the newspapers for the day were sold out.
    "Borrow one first!" someone suggested again. "We can skip eating, but we have to read the newspaper first. Quick, quick, who—who will do their duty?" But no one paid attention to anyone else's words; everyone just concentrated on reading. Everyone's necks seemed a little longer than usual, and their heads bumped into each other from time to time.
    Naturally, the draft interim regulations on home visit leave became the focus of reading.
    "Now it further proves that my opinion is very correct," Old Cheng said as happily as if he had won a battle. "I said long ago that discussing problems should be based on facts, and individual interests should be combined with national interests..."
    "Great minds think alike, that's what we thought too," someone chimed in.

    Recalling a Month Ago's Debate
    Speaking of the matter of home visit leave, our group had countless debates on it as early as the beginning of the rectification campaign. Thinking back to the debates at that time, it was quite interesting.
    Although most of the comrades in the group had their spouses with them, most of them wanted to go back to their long-separated socialist hometowns for a visit. Little Liu and Little Wang were the first to propose fourteen days of leave each year. They listed four major reasons:
    First, Soviet workers have holidays every year, and the socialist system is supposed to care for workers. We are also socialist, so it can't be different.
    Second, the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau and the Railway Bureau have annual leave. We are all born of the same mother, and all fingers are flesh.
    Third, everyone has some private matters throughout the year, and giving fourteen days of leave a year doesn't count for much.
    Fourth, if no leave is given, fourteen days' wages should be added as an encouragement. If you are afraid of affecting work, then spend some money.
    Although most comrades did not completely agree with their opinions, they did not have any objections, seeming to feel that it made sense, but also that the reasons were not sufficient.
    "I say, discussing problems should be based on facts, and individual interests should be combined with national interests," Old Cheng said somewhat excitedly. "Let's compare! Let's compare with the Soviet Union's first five-year plan! We only see their good life now, but we have never thought of their initial hard days. A society without exploitation is a socialist system, and it doesn't necessarily mean that socialism requires fourteen days of leave. People on ships and trains don't have Sundays off, but we have Sunday rest, which finger isn't flesh? There are—hey, let's say a little less—there are at least 20 million workers in China. If each person has fourteen days a year, it's almost seventy or eighty thousand people not working for a year. In addition, a large number of people have to work as substitutes. This is no small amount! And you say it doesn't count for much. This—this is simply the thinking of a spendthrift. Ha! Don't be angry, Little Wang, Little Liu, I'm quick to speak and quick to anger, just making an analogy... Besides, if workers who don't take leave are paid an additional fourteen days' wages each year, the state will have to spend about 600 million yuan more each year. How many Yangtze River bridges can be built with that! Of course, special circumstances should be taken care of, but as for how to take care of them, I don't have a good idea yet."
    "That's what I think too. The country is currently facing difficulties. When the conditions are right in the future, stipulating annual leave is still possible," Old Xia was the first to agree with Old Cheng's opinion.
    "That's how it is, yes, it's right in principle, but this is a practical problem!" Little Liu and Little Wang were still a little unconvinced. "How to solve this practical problem?"
    "Once the principle is understood, the practical problem will be easy to solve, do you think I'm right?" The young Comrade Xiao Zhong opened his mouth. "I say, there must be a sense of propriety in everything we say and do. Those who live in the city and whose spouses live with them should not ask for any home visit leave. Those who are newly married should, in principle, be given an opportunity for reunion, and wages should not be deducted during the leave. The specific method is for the leaders to first investigate and see who can and cannot. For example, like me, my family is all in Hankou, so there is no need. If you have parents in the countryside, you can send them more money for living expenses, and they will be very happy. Communicating frequently is the same as seeing them! When socialist construction is good, everyone can also travel to the Soviet Union at their own expense, not to mention visiting relatives."
    "Right! Right! Little Zhong is right! If individuals have too many difficulties, the country will have difficulties." Everyone said this idea was good.
    "That's what I think too. Parents in the countryside will be well taken care of. The main thing is to meet. In fact, if you are more filial to your parents and strive to be a model at work, your parents will also be honored!" Old Yang said, "If you are not filial to your parents and do not work hard, what's the point of a dry home visit? If the country is not well built, the elderly parents will not enjoy the benefits either!"
    Everyone was silent for a moment.
    "Do your four major reasons need to be retained?" Old Xia said to Little Liu with a smile.
    "Oh! What's the point of mentioning that?" Little Liu said a little embarrassed, "Of course, I only saw myself and didn't see the socialist whole. I thought it was a very correct opinion, but it happened to be wrong. If everyone hadn't made it clear, I would have always thought that socialism meant comparing eating, comparing dressing, and comparing playing, and I would have forgotten to increase production and practice economy!"
    A month ago, the comrades in our group were guessing like this. No one expected that the government would handle these issues so quickly and so thoroughly, and even submit the draft interim regulations.

    Scored 100 Points on the Spot
    Old Xia said, "Look, not only are wages not deducted for home visits, but if the wages are low and the transportation costs exceed one-half of the hourly wage standard, the administration will also subsidize one-half of the excess. This amount is quite considerable!"
      "Really, I really didn't expect it," Little Zhong said to Old Xia while pondering, "I originally considered this point too, but I thought it wasn't very timely, so I didn't bring it up. I always thought that not deducting wages for home visits was already taking care of us, how can we still ask the state to take money to subsidize the excess travel expenses? How can this reflect the thinking of the working class? I really never expected that the Party and the government would be so considerate and caring for the workers."
    "Everyone should read this draft interim regulation more, and we will discuss it later," Old Cheng reminded everyone, "You can still express any opinions you have."
    "With such thoroughness, what other opinions are there?" Little Liu replied very simply. "I do have an opinion, which is that I have some opinions about myself." Little Wang said humorously, "Seven or eight years after liberation, my head is still filled with a lot of bad thoughts for personal gain. Old Cheng, you have to give me a lot of guidance on how to combine theory with practice in the future!"
    "Let's help each other," Old Cheng said with a smile. "I ask you, is it reasonable to pay two cents for a transportation vehicle?"
    "Of course it should be!" Little Wang replied with a smile.
    "Then why is that?" Old Cheng asked again with a smile.
    "Why, the transportation vehicle itself is a welfare, and charging two cents each time is five cents cheaper than the public bus, which is a welfare. We should pay for the ride with the wages we receive. If the state has to pay for everything, socialism cannot be built ahead of schedule, which will affect everyone, right?" Little Wang said confidently.
    "Ah! You're still asking me to guide you, Little Wang's combination with reality is not bad! You scored 100 points on the spot, you're an excellent student!" Old Cheng said while gesturing.
    The whole room was immersed in laughter.

    好消息
    “呵！好消息！”老夏连走带叫地闯进屋来。他马上将报纸一扬，像个宣传员似的报告说：“今天有国务院颁布的退休退职、返家探亲和学徒补贴等暂行规定。”
    没等他说完，大家唰的一声都围拢过来了。一份报纸怎么够看呢！有人提议多买几张来。小姚自告奋勇去买了。
    小姚迟了一步，当天的报纸卖光了。
    “先借一张来嘛！”又有人在提议了，“饭不吃可以，报总得要先看。快快快，谁——谁尽点儿义务好不好？”可是谁也没有理会谁的话，大家只是聚精会神地看。每个人的脖子似乎比平时长了一点，脑袋瓜儿不时地撞着。
    很自然的，回家探亲假期的暂行规定草案成了读报的中心。
    “现在更加证实我的意见是非常的正确”，老程好像打了一个胜仗似的那么高兴说：“我早就说，讨论问题要实事求是，个人利益要和国家利益结合起来……”。
    “英雄所见略同，我们还不是这样想的。”不知是谁这么顶了一句。
    回忆一个月前的争论
    提到回家探亲假期这件事，我们小组早在整风开始就开展过无数次的争论。想起当时的争论，也还是怪有味的。
    虽说小组的大多数同志的爱人都在身边，但多数人都想回到久别的社会主义的家乡走走。小刘和小王首先提出每年要有十四天假期。他们列出了四大理由：
    第一，苏联的工人每年都有假期，社会主义制度就是要关心工人。我们也是社会主义，就不能两样。
    第二，长江航务局、铁路局有年休假期，同是一个娘生的，个个指头都是肉。
    第三，一年到头谁都有点儿私事，一年给十四天休假也算不了什么。
    第四，如果不给休假期，就应加发十四天工资作为鼓励，怕影响工作嘛，那就花点儿钱也行。
    大多数同志虽然并不完全同意他俩的意见，但是也没有什么反对意见，似乎感到有理，又似乎感到理由不那么充足。
    “我说呀，讨论问题要实事求是，个人利益和国家利益要结合起来。”老程有点激动地说：“比吧！和苏联的第一个五年计划的时候比吧！只看到现在人家的生活好，就不曾想到人家开头的艰苦日子。没有剥削的社会制度就是社会主义制度，未必有十四天假期才算社会主义哪。人家在轮船上、火车上没得星期天，我们有星期天休息，哪个指头不是肉呢？全中国就有——哎，少说一点吧也有二千万职工，每人每年十四天的话，就差不多是七八十万人一年不做工作。另外还得要一大批人来代班。这笔账不小呀！还说算不了什么。这——这简直就是败家子的思想。呵！莫生气呀小王、小刘，我是心快嘴快，打个比喻呀。……再说，不休假的人每年加发十四天工资，国家每年要多开支六亿元左右哩。要造几座长江大桥啊！当然，有特殊情况的应当有个照顾，至于怎么个照顾法，我还没有个好主意。”
    “我也是这么个想法，目前国家有困难，等到以后有了条件，规定年休假还是可以的。”老夏首先赞同老程的意见。
    “话是这么说，不错，从道理上讲是对的，可是这是实际问题啊！”小刘、小王仍有点不服输，“怎样来解决这个实际问题呢？”
    “道理上弄通了，实际问题就好办了，你们看我说的对不对？”年轻的小钟同志开了腔：“我说呀，说话做事总得有一个分寸。家住在本市的、爱人和自己同居的就不应当要什么探亲假期。刚结婚的，照道理应该让他（她）们有个团圆的机会，假期中间最好不要扣工资。具体的怎么办，由领导上先调查一下，看哪些人可以，哪些人不可以。比如像我，我一家都在汉口，就没有那个必要。有爸爸妈妈在乡下的，你可以多寄点钱给他们作生活费，他们可高兴啦，时常通通信，不等于见了面一样吗？社会主义建设好了，大家还可以到苏联作自费旅行哩，别说探亲了。”
    “对！对！小钟说的对！个人有困难，照顾多了，国家就有困难。”大家都说这个意见好。
    “我也是这样想的，有父母在乡下的都会有人照顾得很好，主要的是见见面。其实多孝敬一些父母，在工作上争取当模范，父母也光彩啦！”老杨说：“不孝敬父母，不在工作上努力，干巴巴的探亲，有什么意思呢？国家建设不好，老父老母也享不到福啊！”
    大家沉寂了片刻。
    “你们的那四大理由需不需要保留呢？”老夏笑着对小刘说。
    “哦！还提那干什么？”小刘有点不大好意思，说：“当然哪，只看到我个人，看不到社会主义整体，自己认为是很对的意见，恰巧是错误的。不是大家说清楚，我总是以为社会主义嘛，就是要比吃比穿比玩，就忘了增产节约哪！”
    一个月以前，我们小组的同志就是这样猜测着。谁也没有想到：政府处理这一些问题这样快，这样周到，连暂行规定草案都上报了。
    当场考了一百分
    老夏说：“你们看，回家探亲不仅不扣工资，工资少、车船费超过计时工资标准二分之一的，行政还要补贴那超过部分的二分之一，这笔钱算算很可观哩！”
      “真的，的确没有想到”，小钟一面在思索什么，一面对老夏说：“我原来也考虑到这一点，但想想不大合时，所以没有提出来。我总认为回家探亲不扣工资已经是照顾了，还要国家拿笔钱出来贴超出的旅费，怎么能体现出工人阶级的思想呢？真是千想万想，想不到党和政府对职工这样的体贴和关怀。”
    “这个暂行规定草案大家还要多看看，以后还要讨论呢”，老程提醒大家说：“有什么意见，还是可以发表”。
    “这样周到还有什么意见？”小刘回答得很干脆。“意见倒有一个，就是对自己有点意见。”小王诙谐的说：“解放了七八年，脑袋瓜儿里还装了不少的为个人打算的坏思想，以后关于理论联系实际怎么个联法，老程同志要多多指教才好！”
    “还是大家互相帮助嘛，”老程笑着说。“我问你，乘交通车付费二分合不合理？”
    “这当然是应该的呀！”小王边笑边答。
    “那又为什么呢？”老程又笑着问了一句。
    “为什么呀，交通车本身就是福利，每次收费二分比公共汽车便宜五分就是福利。我们拿了工资就该付乘车费。什么都要国家花钱，社会主义就不能提前建成，这对每个人都有影响，对不对？”小王满有把握的说。
    “啊！还客气要我指教哩，小王的联系实际不坏呀！当场就考了一百分，算优等生啦！”老程边说边比划着。
    整个房间浸没在哄笑声里。
