    Strive for Ideological Harvest
    Zhang Luo
    Where does knowledge come from? It comes from labor. However, if intellectuals do not directly participate in physical labor, only believe they have knowledge, and forget their origins, look down on workers and peasants, and do not integrate with workers and peasants, how can they wholeheartedly serve the people? To wholeheartedly serve the people, it is necessary to carry out ideological remoulding. How to carry out ideological remoulding? Is it possible without physical labor? Students at the Beijing Petroleum Institute, after a major debate, answered: The current ideological remoulding of intellectuals must go through physical labor. Our country is carrying out socialist construction, and productive labor practice is the most important and most fundamental content of social practice. Only through physical labor can intellectuals cultivate a mass perspective and a labor perspective, can physical labor and mental labor be combined, can collective wisdom and individual talents be combined, and can they wholeheartedly serve the people.
    In organizing the debate on labor issues, the Beijing Petroleum Institute paid attention to understanding students' ideological situation, dispelling ideological concerns, and purposefully selecting appropriate debate topics. Therefore, the debate unfolded smoothly and vividly, giving everyone a lesson in socialist ideological education. This approach is relatively good. In other institutions of higher learning, it is also possible to proceed from reality and organize debates like this to conduct socialist ideological education for students and strive for ideological harvest.

    争取思想上的丰收
    张罗
    知识是从哪里产生的？是从劳动中产生的。可是，如果知识分子不直接参加体力劳动，只认为自己有知识，而忘掉了本源，看不起工农，不同工农结合，这样如何能全心全意为人民服务？要全心全意为人民服务，那就必须进行思想改造。如何进行思想改造呢？不通过体力劳动行不行呢？北京石油学院学生经过大辩论，这样答复道：当前知识分子的思想改造必须经过体力劳动。我国正在进行社会主义建设，生产劳动实践是社会实践中最主要的最基本的内容。只有通过体力劳动，才能使知识分子培养起群众观点和劳动观点，才能使体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合，才能使集体的智慧和个人的才能相结合，才能全心全意为人民服务。
    北京石油学院在组织关于劳动问题的辩论中，注意了解学生思想情况，解除思想顾虑，有目的地选择恰当的辩论主题，所以辩论顺利展开，生动活泼，使大家受到了一课社会主义思想教育。这种做法是比较好的。在其他高等学校里，也可以从实际出发，像这样来组织辩论，向学生进行社会主义思想教育，争取思想上的丰收。
