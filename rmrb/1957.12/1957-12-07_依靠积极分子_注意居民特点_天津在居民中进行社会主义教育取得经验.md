Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 6th: Xinhua News Agency reporters Shi Jian and Zhu Zemin report: Tianjin's pilot work in carrying out socialist education movement among street residents has basically ended and initial experience has been gained.

    Under the leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the district committees of each district, and the people's committees of each district, Tianjin has conducted pilot work for the socialist education movement in twenty-five neighborhood committees in nine districts since mid-October. These areas include different types such as those where the working people live in concentrated areas, those where residents of all classes live, and those where industrialists and businessmen live. Based on the initial experience of the pilot project, the following links must be firmly grasped in carrying out the socialist education movement among street residents.

	First conduct socialist education for activists
	So that they learn the working methods of the mass line

    First, socialist education should first be carried out among street activists, mobilizing them to carry out airing of views and debates, improving their understanding, and enabling them to learn the working methods of the mass line.

    Since there are many street residents who are scattered, and of all classes; there are few street workers and cadres who are not very familiar with the situation; and activists, including residents' committee directors, members, group leaders, women's representatives, etc., many of whom have been engaged in street work for several years, have relatively close ties with the masses, and are familiar with the situation, it is very important to rely closely on activists to lead the socialist education movement of residents. All the pilot projects in the city first conducted socialist education among more than 1,000 activists. Mobilize them to speak freely and say what they want. According to statistics from 464 activists from 13 neighborhood committees, more than 2,000 opinions were put forward during the airing of views. Most of these opinions are correct. Some incorrect opinions have been basically clarified after debate. Most of the activists have been tempered, raised their awareness, and enhanced their ability to distinguish between right and wrong through airing of views and debates. On this basis, a core group to lead the movement was formed by street cadres and activists, relying on activists to mobilize the masses. Facts have proved that activists have played a great role in enlightening the broad masses of residents to actively participate in airing of views and debates.

	Adopt a variety of methods for publicity and explanation
	Eliminate residents' concerns and set off a climax of airing views

    Second, adopt various methods to repeatedly and thoroughly carry out publicity and explanation, eliminate various specific ideological concerns among residents, and mobilize residents to speak freely and say what they want.

    Many street residents were very active in the early stage of airing of views, but many residents also had concerns. Many working people reflected: "Without the leadership of the Party, how could we have such a good life today," and felt that there was nothing to offer; some held a forgiving attitude towards the shortcomings of the cadres, thinking that "the current cadres are so amiable, it is still not enough! Small shortcomings are not worth mentioning." Some were afraid of retaliation and offending the cadres. Some were afraid that their opinions would not work. Some young women were reluctant to express their opinions in front of many people. Some capitalists, small business owners and families of senior intellectuals mistakenly believed that carrying out socialist education among street residents was to launch an anti-rightist struggle.

    In order to eliminate these concerns, the districts generally mobilized repeatedly by the deputy district head, the director of the street office, etc., explained in simple terms the significance and purpose of carrying out socialist education, and went deep into households to visit, and carried out publicity and explanation for various specific concerns of residents. Responsible cadres of the district and street also expressed to the residents their determination to accept criticism from the masses; if there is any retaliatory behavior, the district people's committee will definitely support the residents. At the same time, in order to facilitate residents to air their views, various forms such as courtyard meetings, group meetings, individual receptions, and suggestion boxes were flexibly adopted. When mobilizing residents to air their views, they were also enlightened to start with the problems of daily life, and then relate to their understanding of national policies.

    After the above steps, a climax of airing of views was set off among the residents. According to preliminary statistics from various residents' committees, more than 10,000 criticisms and suggestions were put forward, covering all aspects from daily life, the work style of street cadres, the management style of commercial departments, public utilities to national policies, basically reaching a deep and thorough level, laying the foundation for carrying out a great debate.

	Adopt the method of recalling comparisons to launch debates
	Cannot mechanically use the experience of institutions and schools

    Third, after the airing of views is thorough, residents are mobilized to launch debates in light of the specific characteristics of street residents.

    According to the universal problems raised in the airing of views, the content of the debate mainly focuses on the tight supply and queuing problems of certain market materials, the grain and cloth planned supply policy, democratic life, changes in social atmosphere, and social security. In addition, debates were also launched separately on the more prominent problems revealed in the airing of views in different regions. For example, in areas where families of industrialists, businessmen, and handicraftsmen live, the superiority of public-private partnerships and cooperativization was debated. In some areas, there were more people flowing into the city from rural areas, so the issues of employment and returning home to produce were debated. Among housewives, the issues of the equal glory of housework and thrift and diligence in managing the household were also debated.

    Since most of the residents participating in the movement in the streets are housewives, with low levels of education and lack of the habit of criticism and self-criticism, the methods of carrying out debates in institutions and schools should not be mechanically used, and the mutual confrontation of different opinions should not be emphasized, nor can one only talk about general principles. The method of debate should be lively and flexible. In the pilot project, the districts generally adopted methods such as chatting, recalling comparisons, detailed accounting, and letting the liberated households talk about their experiences, presenting facts and reasoning to make residents distinguish between right and wrong. The masses, through the comparison of the old and new societies, are in fact receiving education on the two roads, which is mass criticism and self-criticism. For example, when debating the tight supply and queuing problems of certain materials, some people pointed out that queuing in the old society is the same as queuing in the new society, and many residents pointed out that this is fundamentally different. Some old ladies recalled the queuing situation before liberation. At that time, they queued to buy sweet potato flour, bean cakes, and corn flour mixed with hair. Sometimes they could not buy anything even after queuing for a day. When they were so hungry that they had no choice, they ate rotten vegetable scraps and grain husks. At that time, some people had to queue with their children of a few years old in order to be able to buy food, and as a result, the child became ill from the cold and died tragically. Many people talked about queuing after liberation to buy pork, brown sugar, and even sugar-fried chestnuts and movie tickets. Through these vivid comparisons, the residents were very moved, and many people realized that "without the suffering of the past, you would not know the sweetness of today, and the improvement of today's life is brought about by the Communist Party." During the pilot project in Hedong District, a survey was conducted on more than 300 households in a street, and it was found that the average monthly income of residents in the entire street was 16.2 yuan per person, with the highest being 30 yuan and the lowest being 8 yuan. Residents of Taipingzhuang Street in Nankai District clarified the changes in eating meat and clothing before and after liberation by calculating detailed accounts, specifically explaining that their lives had improved. Through these vivid and specific facts, the residents hated the old society even more and further recognized the superiority of the socialist system. This method of recalling comparisons is not only applicable to the working people whose lives have improved, but also to other classes. For example, some family members of capitalists, in connection with the changes in the status of women before and after liberation, the husband's political status, and the children's future, and small business owners in connection with the changes before and after cooperativization, also clarified that only by following the socialist road can there be a bright future.

    Systematically conduct positive publicity and education
    Consolidate the results already achieved in the debate

    Fourth, after the debate, it is necessary to conduct systematic socialist education from a positive perspective, so that residents can link the changes in their personal economic life with the country's socialist construction, in order to consolidate and improve residents' socialist consciousness. In carrying out positive education, the benefits of building the country with diligence and thrift, managing the household with diligence and thrift, and the national planned supply are generally explained systematically, as well as how to correctly treat the employment problem and the significance of housework. Some streets also discussed the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) and the Regulations on Penalties for Public Security Administration, etc. After these positive education, the education received by residents in the debate has been further improved.

    The spirit of rectification and reform should be implemented throughout the entire process
    Fifth, the spirit of rectification and reform must be implemented throughout the entire process of airing of views, debate, and positive education. Therefore, it is necessary to do a good job in the ideological work of cadres, educate cadres in districts, streets, and relevant departments to believe in the majority of the masses, humbly listen to criticisms from the masses, and seriously and conscientiously treat the opinions of the masses. For some shortcomings that can be corrected immediately, they should be corrected in a timely manner; for those that cannot be resolved for a while, a responsible explanation should also be made to the residents. Some retail stores have shortcomings in their management style, and the service attitude of salespersons is not good, so they used big-character posters to express their determination to correct them to the residents, and some store leaders also made self-criticisms to the residents. This further improved the enthusiasm of residents to participate in airing of views and debates.

　　依靠积极分子  注意居民特点
　　天津在居民中进行社会主义教育取得经验
    新华社天津6日电　新华社记者石坚、朱泽民报道：天津市在街道居民中进行社会主义教育运动的试点工作已经基本结束，并且取得初步经验。
    天津市从10月中旬开始，在中共天津市委、各区区委和各区人民委员会领导下，在九个区的二十五个居民委员会中进行了社会主义教育运动的试点工作。这些地区包括劳动人民集中居住的、各阶层居民都有的、工商业者聚居的等不同类型。根据试点的初步经验，在街道居民中开展社会主义教育运动，必须抓紧以下几个环节。
　　先对积极分子进行社会主义教育
　　使他们学会群众路线的工作方法
    第一，首先在街道积极分子中开展社会主义教育，发动他们开展鸣放和辩论，提高他们的认识，使他们学会群众路线的工作方法。
    由于街道居民多、分散，各阶层都有；街道工作干部少，对情况不很熟悉；而积极分子，包括居民委员会主任、委员、小组长、妇女代表等，很多人已从事街道工作好几年，同群众有比较密切的联系，情况熟悉，因此紧密依靠积极分子来领导居民的社会主义教育运动就十分重要。全市各个试点首先在一千多名积极分子中进行了社会主义教育。发动他们大鸣大放，畅所欲言。仅据十三个居民委员会四百六十四名积极分子的统计，在鸣放中共提出意见两千多条。这些意见，大部分是正确的。一些不正确的意见，经过辩论，基本上得到澄清。大部分积极分子经过鸣放和辩论，受到了锻炼，提高了觉悟，增强了辨别是非的能力。在这个基础上，由街道干部和积极分子组成领导运动的核心小组，依靠积极分子发动群众。事实证明，积极分子在启发广大居民积极参加鸣放和辩论等方面，发挥了很大作用。
　  采取多种方式进行宣传解释
　  消除居民顾虑掀起鸣放高潮
    第二，采取各种方式反复深入地进行宣传解释，消除居民中的各种具体思想顾虑，发动居民大鸣大放。
    许多街道居民在鸣放初期表现十分积极，但是也有不少居民存在着顾虑。许多劳动人民反映：“没有党的领导，哪有今天这样好的生活”，认为没有什么意见可提；有的对干部的缺点抱着原谅的态度，认为“现在的干部多么和气，还不知足！小小的缺点，也值不得提。”有的怕打击报复，怕得罪干部。有的怕提了意见不起作用。有些年轻的妇女不愿当着很多人面前发表意见。部分资本家、小业主和高级知识分子的家属，错误地认为在街道居民中进行社会主义教育就是开展反右派斗争。
    为了消除这些顾虑，各区一般都由副区长、街办事处主任等反复进行动员，通俗地讲明进行社会主义教育的意义和目的，并且深入到户访问，针对居民的各种具体顾虑进行宣传解释。区、街的负责干部还向居民表示接受群众批评的决心；如有打击报复行为，区人民委员会一定为居民撑腰。同时，为了便于居民鸣放，灵活采取了院会、片会、个别接待、意见箱等各种形式。在发动居民鸣放时，又启发他们由日常生活的问题谈起，进而联系到对国家政策的认识。
    经过上述步骤，在居民中掀起了大鸣大放的高潮。据各居民委员会初步统计，共提出一万多条批评、建议，从日常生活、街道干部作风、商业部门的经营作风、公用事业到国家政策，各方面的意见都有，基本上达到深透程度，为开展大辩论打下了基础。
　  采取回忆对比的方法展开辩论
  　不能机械搬用机关学校的经验
    第三，在鸣放深透以后，针对街道居民的具体特点，发动居民展开辩论。
    根据鸣放中提出的带有普遍性的问题，辩论的内容以市场某些物资供应紧张和排队问题、粮和布计划供应政策、民主生活、社会风气的改变以及社会治安等问题为主。此外，在不同的地区对鸣放出来的比较突出的问题，也分别展开了辩论。如工商业、手工业家属聚居的地区，辩论了公私合营、合作化的优越性。有些地区从农村流入城市的人口较多，就辩论了就业、还乡生产问题。在家庭妇女中还辩论了家务劳动同样光荣和勤俭持家等问题。
    由于街道居民中参加运动的大多是家庭妇女，文化水平低，又缺乏批评和自我批评的习惯，因此不应该机械搬用机关、学校开展辩论的方式，不要强调不同意见互相交锋，也不能光讲大道理。辩论的方式应该生动灵活。各区在试点中一般采取了漫谈、回忆对比、算细帐、由翻身户讲自己的体验等方式，摆事实、讲道理，使居民明辨是非。群众通过新旧社会的对比，事实上就是受到了两条道路的教育，就是群众性的批评和自我批评。例如在辩论某些物资供应紧张和排队问题时，有人提出旧社会排队新社会也同样排队，许多居民就指出这根本不同。有些老大娘回忆起解放前的排队情况，那时排队买的是山芋面、豆饼、掺头发丝的玉米面，有时排一天也买不到，饿的没有办法就吃烂菜帮、谷皮子；那时有的人为了能买到粮食，不得不和自己几岁的小孩一同去排队，结果孩子竟冻病惨死。许多人谈到解放后排队买的是猪肉、红糖，甚至是糖炒栗子、电影票。通过这些活生生的对比，居民们非常感动，许多人认识到“没有过去的苦，不知道今天的甜，今天生活的改善都是共产党带来的。”河东区在试点中对一个街三百多户居民进行了调查，发现全街居民平均每人每月收入为十六点二元，最高的三十元，最低的也有八元。南开区太平庄街居民通过算细帐，弄清楚了解放前后吃肉、穿衣的变化情况，具体地说明了生活有了改善。居民们通过这些生动具体的事实，更加痛恨旧社会，进一步认识到社会主义制度的优越性。这种回忆对比的方法，不仅对于生活得到改善的劳动人民适用，对于其他阶层也同样适用。例如有些资本家家属联系到解放前后妇女地位的变化、丈夫有了政治地位、子女有了前途，小业主联系到合作化前后的变化等，也明确了只有走社会主义的道路才有光明的前途。
    系统地进行正面宣传教育
    巩固辩论中已获得的成果
    第四，经过辩论以后，必须从正面进行系统的社会主义教育，使居民把个人经济生活的变化和国家的社会主义建设联系起来，以巩固和提高居民的社会主义觉悟。在进行正面教育中，一般都系统地讲解了勤俭建国、勤俭持家、国家计划供应的好处，如何正确对待就业问题，家务劳动的意义等。有些街道还讨论了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）和治安管理处罚条例等文件。经过这些正面教育，居民在辩论中所受到的教育就进一步得到提高。
　  整个过程中要贯彻边整边改精神
    第五，在鸣放、辩论以及正面教育的整个过程中，必须贯彻边整边改的精神。因此，必须作好干部的思想工作，教育区、街和有关部门的干部相信群众大多数，虚心听取群众批评，严肃认真地对待群众意见。对一些能立即改正的缺点，要及时加以改正；对一时不能解决的，也要向居民做负责的交代。有些零售店经营作风有缺点，售货员服务态度不好，就用大字报向居民表示了改正的决心，有的商店负责人还向居民作了检讨。这样就进一步提高了居民参加鸣放和辩论的积极性。
