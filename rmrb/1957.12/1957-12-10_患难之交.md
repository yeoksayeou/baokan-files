　　Friends in Need
　　By Our Correspondent Hu Jibang

　　Hungarian-Soviet friendship suffered some damage last year. This year, a large-scale Hungarian-Soviet Friendship Month movement has been launched across the country centered around the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution. One of the characteristics of this movement is the promotion of the revolutionary traditions of Hungarian-Soviet friendship. The visit of the Soviet Old Bolshevik delegation in October became the prelude to the unfolding of this movement.

　　To commemorate the inseparable ties between the Hungarian working people and the Great October Revolution, the Military History Museum specially organized the exhibition "Hungarian Internationalist Veterans in the Great October Revolution and Civil War." During the October Revolution, there were 500,000 Hungarian prisoners of war in Russia, nearly 100,000 of whom, inspired by Lenin's internationalism in the tide of the October Revolution, joined the Red Army and became revolutionary fighters. On the opening day of the exhibition, more than 300 Hungarian Red Army veterans and Soviet officers were invited to meet. They had shed blood, performed meritorious service, and received awards in each other's countries for the common revolutionary cause. During the counter-revolutionary riots last October, some people with ulterior motives called the Soviet army's brotherly support "intervention." This fallacy is a slander against the historical origin of the two countries' revolutionary friendship. The fact is that the people of the two countries have long forged obligations of life and death together.

　　The Hungarian Red Army veterans who attended came from factories and rural areas, and they were very excited to talk to each other about the past. An old worker used the Russian he had learned forty years ago to talk to a Soviet officer who had participated in the liberation of Hungary twice about Lenin and Kun Béla's personal speeches to more than 40,000 Hungarian prisoners of war in Samara in the winter of 1917. He said that at that time, the Mensheviks regarded the prisoners of war as representatives of the enemy country and demanded retaliatory measures, while Lenin regarded them as his comrades in arms and called on them to join the Red Army. In 1918, Lenin came to Samara again to preside over the meeting. At that time, he was already a Red Army soldier who had participated in several battles and served as Lenin's temporary guard. In early 1919, Lenin personally received more than 4,000 of the best Hungarian Red Army fighters, praised and thanked them for their bravery, and told them to plant this revolutionary flag further afield. Soon, the Hungarian veteran returned to Hungary to engage in revolution.

　　Another veteran, named Frankó, was in his sixties, with an honest face, dressed in simple peasant clothes, and wearing medals from the Hungarian and Soviet governments on his chest. In 1921, he made meritorious service in Ukraine for his bravery in combat. On the second day of the Hungarian riots last year, he organized reliable forces in the village, attacked the enemy, arrested the counter-revolutionary leaders, disbanded the counter-revolutionary organizations in the village, and helped defend two nearby villages. This year, he made another contribution in the struggle to suppress counter-revolution.

　　A dignified and kind old woman with white hair also attracted everyone's attention. She was Mrs. Kun Béla, who had recently returned from the Soviet Union for the first time at the invitation of the government. Kun Béla was the organizer of the Hungarian prisoner of war movement, one of the founders of the Hungarian Communist Party, and the leader of the Soviet Republic. He unfortunately died in 1937. Many veterans present had engaged in revolution with Kun Béla. Mrs. Kun Béla said that they had not seen each other for thirty-eight years since the failure of the revolution in 1919 and their exile abroad, and this great festival evoked many exciting recollections for them. Currently, she is writing memoirs about Kun Béla's revolutionary activities.

　　The veterans considered this meeting to be one of the most glorious commemorations of their later years.

　　Another feature of the Hungarian-Soviet Friendship Month is the love of the working class and peasants for the Soviet army. In early November, the whole country, both urban and rural, was swept into the climax of commemorating the October Revolution. This climax was expressed not in hanging lanterns and colored streamers or singing and dancing carnival, but in a general expression of gratitude to the Soviet army and commemoration of the martyrs. Meetings with the Soviet army and flower offerings to the martyrs' tombstones formed a spontaneous mass movement.

　　The Soviet army helped the Hungarian people restore security and order day and night at this time last year, and this year they are no less busy than last year. Comrades from the Soviet Military Affairs Office said: "Now we are busy with get-togethers day and night. Some days, all personnel are simply sent out." Some residents even sent invitations from afar. For example, residents of Szolnok invited three Soviet officers who had helped them suppress the counter-revolutionaries last year to be guests. After they went, they were immediately surrounded by enthusiastic masses. All villages or factories near which Soviet troops were stationed regarded inviting Soviet troops as their main wish. Some one or two dozen households put together a meal in one family and jointly invited several Soviet soldiers to dine together. When the "Hungarian Chemical Factory" held a celebration, they also invited Soviet soldiers. Because the car broke down on the way, the guests were more than an hour late, but more than 400 workers, with urgent anxiety, ran from the venue to the road to wait, watching every car that passed by, afraid that something had happened or that they had found the wrong address. Speaking of the contact with the Soviet army, the relationship between the Csepel workers and the Soviet army is the closest. They jointly organized a trip on the Danube River with one or two thousand people in the summer. During the Friendship Month, the Soviet army attended every factory's commemoration meeting, and when the Soviet army held a celebration meeting in the barracks, they also invited Hungarian comrades. To express the working class's commemoration of the Soviet army martyrs, the Csepel Automobile Factory automatically raised funds to build a new monument. The construction of Soviet army martyrs' monuments in various places has also become a spontaneous mass movement during this Friendship Month. On the eve of the festival, some monuments that were damaged by counter-revolutionaries last year have been rushed to repair, and residents have automatically participated in the flower offering and memorial ceremonies.

　　The employees of the "May 1st" Textile Factory issued a call this summer to take care of the nearby Soviet army martyrs' cemetery. People are sent to the tomb every day in rotation to offer flowers. On November 7th, more than 4,000 workers participated in the flower offering memorial ceremony, and the workers sang a requiem for the martyrs. Hungarian military police and workers' self-defense forces guarded the martyrs, and female workers read letters to the martyrs' families with tears in their eyes.

　　Some factories, institutions, and agricultural production cooperatives wrote letters to the families of the Soviet army martyrs, inviting them to be guests in Hungary. The parents, brothers, and sisters of martyr Merkulov were invited to Hungary to sweep the tomb this time. When they first arrived, the family members were very sad because they had lost the most beloved child in the family, but when they left, the martyr's mother said: "Now I see Hungary's achievements in the past year and the working people's enthusiastic reception of our family, which makes us fully believe that our son's blood has not been shed in vain, and our pain has been alleviated a little."

　　The third feature of the Hungarian-Soviet Friendship Month is that intellectuals also actively participated in friendship activities. On the eve of the festival, the amazing news of the Soviet Union launching an artificial satellite stunned some intellectuals with pro-American ideas, and people who generally did not have preconceived ideas were delighted.

　　During this Friendship Month, the Soviet Union sent artists with high accomplishments, such as Maretskaya, the lead actress of "Mother," and pianist Chak, violinist Kogan, dancers and singers from the Moscow Grand Theater, and famous actors from the National Circus. Some performed jointly with the Hungarian side, and some performed alone, all with very good results. The Soviet Film Week had more than 400,000 viewers in five days. Armenian female singer Darukhanova sang famous songs from all over the world to the audience in six languages.

　　In late November, a Health Week and a Justice Week were held here, which was a major event. Not only did famous Hungarian doctors, scholars, and jurists participate in this event, but the Soviet Union also sent experts and leaders to give special reports. A delegation of Soviet national education workers is also coming to Hungary for a visit. In addition, a series of exhibitions were held, such as the Soviet Book Publishing Exhibition, which featured more than 40 Russian translations of Hungarian classical and modern works. The "Atomic Energy for Peaceful Uses" exhibition and the Soviet Fifteen Republics Exhibition, which were held recently, have aroused the interest of a large audience. A Soviet Drama Development History Exhibition is also being prepared.

　　During the Friendship Month, Hungarian academic circles visited the Soviet Union frequently.

　　In short, the scope of this Hungarian-Soviet friendship activity is very broad, covering almost all departments of cultural and educational life. Therefore, it has greatly accelerated the differentiation process in intellectual circles. General prejudices against the Soviet Union are gradually being eliminated, and ideological feelings have moved a big step closer to the Soviet Union.

　　患难之交
　　本报记者　胡济邦
    匈苏友谊去年曾一度遭受破坏。今年围绕着庆祝伟大十月革命四十周年，在全国各地展开了一个规模宏大的匈苏友好月运动。这次运动中的特点之一是发扬了匈苏革命传统的友谊。十月间苏联老布尔什维克代表团的访问，成了这次运动展开的序幕。
    军事历史博物馆为纪念匈牙利劳动人民和伟大十月革命的血肉关系，特地组织了“伟大十月革命和内战时期的匈牙利国际主义老战士们”展览会。十月革命期间，在俄国境内有五十万匈牙利战俘，其中将近十万人在十月革命浪潮中因受到列宁国际主义的感召而参加了红军，成为革命战士。展览会开幕那一天邀请了三百多位匈牙利老红军和苏联军官们会见。他们都为共同的革命事业在彼此的国家内流过血，立过功，受过奖。在去年10月反革命暴乱期间，有些别有用心的人把苏军的兄弟支援叫做
  “干涉”，这种谬论是对两国革命友谊历史渊源的诬蔑。事实是两国人民之间早已结下生死与共的义务。
    到会的匈牙利老红军们有的来自工厂，有的来自农村，他们十分兴奋地彼此谈着往事。一位老工人用他四十年前学到的俄语同一位两次参加过匈牙利解放的苏联军官谈起1917年冬天列宁和孔贝拉亲自到沙马拉对四万多名匈牙利战俘的讲话的情形。他说，当时孟什维克把战俘看作敌国的代表，要求采取报复手段，而列宁则把他们看作是自己的战友，号召他们加入红军。1918年列宁又一次来到沙马拉主持会议。那时他已经是参加过几次战斗的红军战士，担任过列宁的临时警卫员。1919年初，列宁亲自接见了四千多名匈牙利最优秀的红军战士，对他们的英勇善战表示赞扬和感谢，并且叫他们把这面革命的旗帜插到更远的地方去。不久，这位匈牙利老战士就回匈牙利搞革命了。
    另一位老战士叫弗朗柯，已上六十岁的年纪，一张忠厚的脸，穿着质朴的农民服装，胸前佩带着匈苏两国政府的勋章。1921年，他在乌克兰因作战英勇立了功。去年匈牙利暴乱发生的第二天，他就组织起了村内可靠的力量，向敌人进攻，逮捕了反革命头子，解散了村里的反革命组织，并且还帮助保卫了附近两个村庄。今年在镇压反革命的斗争中又立了一次功。
    会上一位庄严慈祥的白发苍苍的妇人，也引起大家的注意，她是孔贝拉夫人，最近应政府的邀请，第一次从苏联回来。孔贝拉是匈牙利战俘运动的组织者，匈牙利共产党的创始人之一，苏维埃共和国的领导者，1937年不幸牺牲。在场的许多老战士都和孔贝拉一起搞过革命。孔贝拉夫人说，自从1919年革命失败流亡国外，他们已有三十八年不见了，这个伟大的节日引起了他们许多兴奋的回顾。目前，她正在写著有关孔贝拉革命活动的回忆录。
    这个会见，老战士们认为是他们晚年时代一个最光辉的纪念。
    匈苏友好月的另一特点是工农群众对苏军的热爱。11月上旬，全国城乡都卷入纪念十月革命的高潮，这个高潮的表现不是悬灯结彩，歌舞狂欢，而是普遍表示对苏军的感谢和对烈士的纪念。同苏军会见和向烈士墓碑献花形成了一个自发的群众运动。
    苏军去年此时日夜帮助匈牙利人民恢复安全秩序，今年的忙碌程度也不下于去年。苏联军务处的同志说：“现在是日夜忙于联欢会见，有些天简直全部人员都派空了。”有些居民还从远地寄来请帖，如索尔诺克城的居民邀请去年帮他们镇反有功的三位苏联军官前去作客，他们去了之后，马上就被群众热情地包围起来。凡附近驻有苏军的村庄或工厂，都以邀请苏军作为自己的主要愿望。有的一、二十户人家，凑在一个家庭里，联合邀请几位苏联战士一同聚餐。“匈牙利化学工厂”开庆祝会时也邀请了苏联战士，因汽车在途中发生故障，客人迟到一个多小时，但四百多工人怀着迫切不安的心情都从会场跑到马路上等候，注视着从眼前驶过的每辆汽车，深怕出了事或找错了地址。谈到和苏军的联系，要算切佩尔工人和苏军关系最为密切，他们在夏天就联合组织过一千几百人的多瑙河上的旅行。在友好月，苏军出席了每个工厂的纪念会，苏军在兵营中举行庆祝会时，也邀请了匈牙利同志。为了表示工人阶级对苏军烈士的纪念，切佩尔汽车制造厂自动集资修建新的纪念碑。各地修建苏军烈士纪念碑，也成为这次友好月中的群众自发运动。节日前夕，有些地方被去年反革命打坏的纪念碑，都已赶修起来，居民们自动参加了献花和追悼典礼。
      “五一”纺织厂的职工，今年夏天就发出看护附近苏军烈士公墓的号召。每日派人轮流到墓上献花。在11月7日那天，四千多个工人参加了献花追悼典礼，工人们为烈士合唱安息的挽歌。匈牙利的军警和工人自卫队为烈士们守卫，女工们含着眼泪宣读给烈士家属的书信。
    有些工厂、机关和农业生产合作社向苏军烈士的家属们纷纷写信，邀请他们来匈牙利作客。梅尔库列夫烈士的父母、兄妹这次应邀来匈牙利扫墓。初到时，家属们十分悲伤，因为他们失去了全家最心爱的孩子，但在离开时烈士的母亲说：“现在我看到匈牙利一年来的成就和劳动人民对我们一家的热情接待，使我们完全相信：我们儿子的血不曾白流，我们的痛苦也减轻一些了。”
    匈苏友好月的第三个特点是知识分子也积极参加了友好活动。在节日前夕，苏联放射人造卫星这个惊人的消息，使一些有崇美思想的知识分子目瞪口呆，一般不抱成见的人都感到欢欣鼓舞。
    在这次友好月里，苏联派来了有高度修养的艺术家，如“母亲”的主角玛列茨卡雅和钢琴家查克，小提琴家柯岗，莫斯科大戏院的舞蹈家和歌唱家，国家马戏院的名演员。有的和匈方合演，有的单独演出，都获得非常好的效果。苏联电影周五天之内就有四十多万观众。亚美尼亚女歌唱家达鲁哈诺娃以六种语言给观众们演唱了世界各地的名歌。
    11月下旬，此间举行了保健周和司法周，这是一件大事。这个活动不仅有匈牙利著名的医生、学者和法律学家参加，苏联也派来了专家和领导人作专题报告。苏联的国民教育工作者代表团也要来匈牙利访问。此外，还举办了一系列的展览会，如苏联书籍出版展览会，会上展出的匈牙利古典和现代著作的俄译本就有四十多种。日前举办的“原子能和平用途”展览会、苏联十五个加盟共和国展览会等等，都引起了广大观众的兴趣。现在还在准备一个苏联戏剧发展史展览会。
    在友好月中，匈牙利学术界访苏活动十分频繁。
    总之，这次匈苏友好活动的面非常广，几乎包括文教生活的各个部门。因此大大加速知识界的分化过程，一般对苏联的偏见已在逐渐消除中，思想感情向苏联靠近了一大步。
