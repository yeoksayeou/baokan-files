Old Workers Speak Their Minds

    After the State Council announced the provisional regulations (draft) regarding the study period and living allowances for apprentices, the workers of the Minhe Oil Extraction Team of the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau held a discussion. Everyone expressed great satisfaction, especially the old workers who felt sincerely happy.

    Many old workers said that in the past, the apprenticeship period was too short, promotions were too fast, and treatment was too high, which made many young workers arrogant and complacent, extravagant in their lives, causing disunity between new and old workers, and also affecting worker-peasant relations. Old worker Wang Ruiting said: When I was an apprentice in the old society, as soon as I entered the factory, I had to cook, sweep the floor, wipe the table, and take care of the master and his wife’s children. I didn’t learn anything. In the fourth year, I served the master, and in the fifth year, I only earned four or five yuan. Today’s apprentices are promoted several levels in half a year after entering the factory, and their wages are more than what I earned after working for more than ten years in the old society. Old worker Jiang Xusheng, who is over fifty years old, said: Rapid promotion is not good for the apprentices themselves. Last year, our team recruited a group of apprentices from Shanghai in May. By the time of the wage reform in October, one or two dozen of them had been promoted to level three, earning more than sixty yuan per month. Take Liu Changbao, for example, a young man of seventeen or eighteen, who was promoted to level three less than half a year after joining the team. He smokes "Daqianmen" cigarettes every day and struts around like a young master in the old society. Jin Chenchang was promoted to level three and also ate and drank extravagantly, spending twenty or thirty yuan a month on food, and going to restaurants on Sundays for a few drinks to improve his life. If others advise them to be thrifty, they argue righteously, saying: "I earned the money." This discussion also had a great educational effect on the young apprentices. They also believe that this regulation is completely reasonable.

    老工人说了心里话
    国务院关于学徒的学习期限和生活补贴的暂行规定（草案）宣布后，我们青海石油勘探局民和采油队的工人，进行了一次讨论，大家表示非常满意，特别是老工人从内心里感到高兴。
    许多老工人说，过去学徒学习期限过短，升级太快，待遇过高，使许多青年工人骄傲自满，生活铺张浪费，造成新老工人不团结，也影响工农关系。老工人王瑞亭说：我在旧社会当学徒时，一进厂就先给师傅师母做饭、扫地、擦桌子、抱孩子，什么也没学到；第四年头为师傅效劳，第五年头才挣四、五元钱。今天的徒工进厂半年就是好几级，工资比我在旧社会干了十几年的还多。五十多岁的老工人蒋旭升说：学徒升级太快对他本人也不利。我们队去年5月份从上海招收来的一批学徒，到10月份工资改革时就有一二十个升为三级，每月拿六十多元。就拿刘长豹来说吧，十七八岁的小青年，来队不到半年，升了三级，每天嘴里含着大前门香烟，大摇大摆，跟旧社会里的大少爷一样。金晨昌升了三级，也大吃大喝，每月伙食费二三十元，星期日还要下馆子喝几杯，改善改善生活。别人要是劝他们节俭点，他们还理直气壮地说：“钱是我挣来的”。这次讨论，对青年徒工也起了很大的教育作用。他们也认为这个规定完全合理。
