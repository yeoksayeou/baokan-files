Building Dormitories Can Still Be Cheaper

In recent years, the cost of housing built with state investment has been continuously reduced. The national average cost per square meter of construction area was 69 yuan in 1953, 70 yuan in 1954, 60 yuan in 1955, and 42 yuan in 1956. From 1953 to 1956, the national average decreased by about 40%. According to calculations by a design department in Shenyang, the cost per square meter of construction area for three-story residential buildings with roughly the same usage was 125 yuan in 1952, 122 yuan in 1953, 80 yuan in 1954, 50 yuan in 1955, and 59 yuan in 1956. The cost in 1956 was only 47.2% of the cost in 1952. The cost of brick and wood bungalows was generally 70 yuan per square meter in 1952, but now it only costs 40 to 50 yuan.

From the current situation in various regions, the possibility of further reducing housing costs is still very large. For example, in Qiqihar City, the cost per square meter of construction area for most of the brick and wood bungalow residences currently being built is over 40 yuan. However, a factory in Fularji is currently building brick and wood bungalows with a budgeted cost of only 33 yuan (36 yuan including the kang and stove). In Shenyang City, the cost per square meter of construction area for three-story mixed-structure residential buildings currently under construction is generally around 60 yuan. However, a mechanical factory in this city is building three-story mixed-structure residential buildings this year with a cost of only 47.8 yuan per square meter, about 20% lower than the general cost.

According to relevant analysis, in North and Northeast China, material costs account for the largest proportion of housing costs, about 70%. Therefore, reducing material costs is the central issue for further reducing housing costs. By lowering housing construction standards and adopting advanced designs, material consumption can be reduced. For example, the indoor clear height can be reduced from about 3 meters to 2.6 meters to 2.4 meters. For every 10 centimeters the indoor clear height is reduced, the cost can be reduced by about 2%. Using local materials and adopting inexpensive substitute materials can also save material costs. For example, replacing heating with a kang can reduce the cost by 4 to 6 yuan per square meter.

Indirect costs generally account for about 15% of housing costs. By streamlining institutions, rationally organizing construction, reducing idle labor, and reducing expenditures on hiring temporary workers, housing costs can also be greatly reduced. (Zhang Chengbo)

### 盖宿舍还能便宜

　　盖宿舍还能便宜
　　几年来，国家投资兴建的住宅造价不断降低。全国平均每平方公尺建筑面积的造价，1953年是六十九元，1954年是七十元，1955年是六十元，1956年是四十二元；从1953年到1956年，全国平均降低了40％左右。据沈阳一个设计部门计算，使用上差不多的三层楼房住宅，每平方公尺建筑面积的造价，1952年为一百二十五元，1953年为一百二十二元，1954年为八十元，1955年为五十元，1956年为五十九元；1956年的造价仅为1952年造价的47.2％。砖木平房的造价，1952年一般要七十元一平方公尺，现在只要四、五十元。
    从目前各地的情况来看，进一步降低住宅造价的可能性还是很大的。例如，齐齐哈尔市目前建设的砖木平房住宅，每平方公尺建筑面积的造价大部分都在四十元以上；而富拉尔基一个工厂今年正在建设的砖木平房，预算造价仅为三十三元（加上火炕和锅台为三十六元）。沈阳市目前建设的混合结构的三层住宅，每平方公尺建筑面积的造价一般在六十元左右；但是这个市的一个机械工厂，今年建设的三层混合结构的住宅，每平方公尺造价只有四十七点八元，比一般造价约低20％。
    据有关方面分析，在华北和东北地区，住宅造价中材料费占的比重最大，约占70％左右。因此，降低材料费用是进一步降低住宅造价的中心问题。通过降低住宅建筑标准和采用先进设计，可以减少材料消耗量。例如室内净高可以由三公尺左右降低到二点六公尺至二点四公尺，室内净高每降低十公分，造价就可以降低2％左右。就地取材和采用廉价代用材料，也可以节省材料费用。例如用火炕代替暖气，每平方公尺的造价就可以降低四元到六元。
    间接费在住宅造价中一般约占15％左右。通过紧缩机构、合理组织施工，减少窝工和雇用临时工人等支出，也可以使房屋造价大大降低。（张澄波）
