　　Atlantic Partners' Centrifugal Tendencies Strengthen
    American Officials Deeply Uneasy

    (Comprehensive report from this newspaper) Xinhua News Agency reported: Some political figures in Washington are deeply uneasy about the neutralist sentiments displayed by some European countries at the recent North Atlantic Group meeting.

    Republican leader of the U.S. Senate, Knowland, said that one aspect of the Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting made him very uneasy, and that was the tendency towards neutralism that he discovered in the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    Senator Mansfield, in discussing the "achievements" of the Paris Conference, said: He was "not at all surprised" that some members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization opposed the United States immediately establishing missile bases on their territory. However, he said: "What surprises me is that the American delegation was completely unprepared for this reaction."

    Reuters' Washington dispatch said that some senior officials in Washington said on the evening of the 18th that the United States' allies were pushing the United States too hard and too fast on the road to new negotiations with the Soviet Union. The dispatch said: The reaction of Western European countries to Bulganin's proposals for peaceful coexistence had "overshadowed" the United States' originally prepared plans for intensified war preparations, and Eisenhower and American officials were therefore "somewhat alarmed." The US government is increasingly feeling that "the United States cannot prevent contact between the West and the Soviet Union."

    "New York Times" reporter Middleton reported from Paris that military and diplomatic personnel of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization believe that Norway and Denmark's unwillingness to provide their territory to the United States as a base for nuclear weapons is "the most serious event of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting." The reporter said, "This event revealed the political weakness of the northern flank of the Atlantic alliance."

    Middleton quoted some political figures from the American and British delegations as saying that he was worried that the attitudes of Norway and Denmark "would encourage the strong neutralist factions in these countries."

    The "New York Times" Washington correspondent wrote, "The European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's demands for negotiations with the Soviet Union have greatly frustrated government officials..."

    Furthermore, according to U.S. Representative Wayne Hays on the 17th, Eisenhower's prestige in Western Europe has declined significantly in recent months. Hays led a four-member House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee that recently traveled to Europe, the Near East, and Africa for six weeks.

　　大西洋伙伴离心倾向增强
    美国官员深感不安
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：华盛顿的一些政界人物对于近两天北大西洋集团会议上表现出来的一些欧洲国家的中立主义情绪深感不安。
    美国参议院共和党领袖诺兰说，大西洋公约组织会议的一个方面使他非常不安，这就是他发现在北大西洋公约组织成员国中有中立主义的趋势。
    参议员曼斯菲尔德在议论巴黎会议的“成就”时说：他对某些北大西洋公约组织成员国反对美国马上在它们的土地上建立导弹基地这件事“丝毫不感到奇怪”。但是，他说：“我感到奇怪的是，美国代表团对于这个反应竟然全无思想准备。”
    路透社的华盛顿消息说，华盛顿的某些高级官员18日晚上说，在同苏联进行新的谈判这条路上，美国的盟国把美国催逼得太紧和太快。这条消息说：西欧国家对布尔加宁的和平共处建议的反应使美国原来准备好的加紧备战计划“黯然失色”，艾森豪威尔和美国官员因此“有些惊慌”。美国政府已经愈来愈强烈地感到“美国不能防止西方同苏联的接触”。
    “纽约时报”记者密德尔顿自巴黎报道，北大西洋公约组织的军人和外交家认为，挪威和丹麦不愿意把自己的领土供给美国作核武器的基地这件事，是“北大西洋公约组织理事会会议的最严重的事件”。这位记者说，“这件事显露了大西洋联盟北翼的政治弱点”。
    密德尔顿引用了美国和英国代表团的一些政治人物的话，他担心，挪威和丹麦的态度“会鼓励这些国家中强有力的中立派”。
    “纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者写道，“北大西洋公约组织欧洲成员国要求和苏联谈判，使政府人士十分沮丧……”。
    又据美国众议员威恩·海斯17日说，最近几个月来，艾森豪威尔在西欧的威信已经大大下降。海斯领导了一个由四人组成的众议院外交小组委员会，这个委员会最近在欧洲、近东和非洲作了为时六星期的旅行。
