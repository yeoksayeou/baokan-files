    Meeting with Ulanova
    Mei Lanfang
    In 1935, when I visited the Soviet Union for the first time, I met the outstanding ballet performer Ulanova and saw her "Swan Lake." Seventeen years later, in 1952, during the Sino-Soviet Friendship Month, she came to China for a visit, and I saw her wonderful ballet again. That time, she also visited the Chinese Opera School in the capital. While the students were practicing in the rehearsal hall, I specifically introduced the process of learning Chinese classical opera to her. Our students performed "The Tale of the White Snake" for her, and in the end, everyone took a photo together on the stage.
    Soviet dramatists admire the virtual movements of riding horses, rowing boats, going upstairs, and crossing bridges in Chinese opera, as well as the varied gestures. During the Sino-Soviet Friendship Month festivities, I entertained the Soviet literary and art circles with a performance of "Drunken Beauty." When I finished the performance and was removing my makeup, Ulanova came backstage to thank me, saying, "I really like the gestures in Chinese opera. Even though 'Drunken Beauty' wears court attire with long sleeves covering her hands, the occasional glimpses of your hands have such a strong and intoxicating appeal." She held my hand and looked at it carefully, finally saying, "Your hands are still just like those of ordinary actors; there's no secret."
    At the end of 1952, on my way back from attending the World Peace Congress in Vienna, I passed through Moscow and was entertained by the Soviet Peace Committee, spending the New Year of 1953 there. When I got off the train, the first thing I saw was Comrade Ulanova walking through the crowd to greet me, expressing her appreciation for my hard work and congratulating me on my victorious return from the World Peace Congress. They escorted me into a car. Later, a Soviet reporter who could speak Chinese told me, "In recent years, Comrade Ulanova has paid special attention to her physical rest in order to maintain the integrity and fullness of her performances. Therefore, she rarely goes to train stations and airports to welcome guests. This time, coming to the station to welcome Mr. Mei shows the depth of your friendship."
    In November 1957, our Chinese labor delegation went to Moscow and, immediately after getting off the plane, attended the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. We heard the congratulatory messages from Soviet leaders and representatives of fraternal countries, as well as from our Chairman Mao, all of which elaborated on the significant benefits the October Revolution brought to humanity. These resounding voices struck the heartstrings of everyone. On the reviewing stand in Red Square, we saw the magnificent and heroic strides of socialist advanced workers. The diverse rockets in the ranks attracted all the spectators. We also saw the Soviet artificial satellite, a sister to the first artificial satellite, now on display in the planetarium. During such a solemn, grand, and joyous festival, in addition to collective activities like meetings and visits, we also took time out of our busy schedules to visit the homes of our friends in the Soviet literary and art circles. We were warmly received at the home of the hospitable director of the Puppet Theater, Obraztsov, and at the home of the writer Polevoy. Simonov also took time out of his busy schedule to join us at Polevoy's house, and there were several poetic literary gatherings filled with friendship and joy. In this short article, I want to focus on my reunion with Ulanova.
    At a party, I saw another short ballet by Ulanova. Her exquisite performance can be described as "her face like the bright moon, her body like a light breeze." It reminded me of what is said in ancient Chinese books about Zhao Feiyan, who could perform dances on the palm of a hand. Although it is impossible to see this ancient dance, it seemed to appear before us today.
    Another day, she performed a large ballet, "The Red Poppy." I didn't know about it beforehand and couldn't find a ticket at the last minute. I expressed my desire to visit her through the reception unit. After contacting her, we arranged to meet at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. I heard that she still frequently practiced on the stage of the theater, probably because she didn't want to give up a day of practice, so she received guests there.
    Let me take this opportunity to introduce the artistic life of ballet dancers. Ballet is a difficult artistic labor. All the strength of the body is concentrated on the toes, which is even more strenuous than the stilt-walking (支蹻) in Chinese classical opera's female roles (花旦). Diet and sleep must be strictly controlled to maintain standard weight. In the past Sino-Soviet Friendship Month, when the Soviet cultural delegation came to China for a visit, most of the delegation members came by train, but Ulanova took a plane. It is said that if she lived on a train for ten consecutive days, eating and sleeping, her weight would increase, and she would be unable to practice, which would not be suitable for her. The artistic age of ballet dancers is generally between thirty and forty years old. Ulanova has long surpassed this age, which is a miracle. The Soviet people respect her as a national treasure, and it is not accidental.
    The year before last, another famous Soviet ballet dancer, Lepeshinskaya, came to China for a visit. I visited her at the Beijing Hotel and talked about some ballet performance techniques. She told me that her main purpose in coming to China with the cultural delegation was for travel and sightseeing, not for performing. However, she spent several minutes every morning and evening practicing basic ballet movements because if she missed practice during the month-long visit to China, it would be a loss in terms of her art.
    Ulanova once said, "At the beginning of my dance career, technique occupied my main attention, taking up most of my time and energy. However, this training was never aimed at acrobatics, but rather at improving technique, mastering more stage movements, and achieving a continuous and natural transition of movements, like the flow of water. With this ability, one can express great emotions, and dance will be generalized and poetic."
    When we see Ulanova performing, we not only appreciate her outstanding dance technique, but also feel that, through this technique, she poetically expresses people's sincere and profound emotions.
    On a clear morning, Tian Han, Lao She, Yang Hansheng, Wang Kun, and I went to the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. Ulanova stood by the stairs, welcoming us into the reception room.
    I gave her a copy of "Chinese Opera Costume Patterns" printed in color, and she was very happy. While reading it, she said to me, "The patterns are rich, and the colors are bright. Chinese printing art has progressed." She added, "After performing, reading this kind of book about opera art can adjust my spirit and restore my fatigue."
    I also gave her a photograph, a joint picture of Jiang Miaoxiang, Bao Jiu, and me in "Broken Bridge." She pointed to Qing'er, played by Bao Jiu, and said, "This is your son. When your grandson grows up in the future, it will be even more meaningful for three generations of your family to perform a play together. Artists in the new era do not grow old."
    Comrade Tian Han gave her a red folding fan with a poem written on it, praising her performance in the ballet "The Red Poppy." She thanked him and asked if I had seen the play. I said, "I didn't see your masterpiece that day because I couldn't find a ticket at the last minute. I'm very sorry." She talked about her experience in rehearsing "The Red Poppy," which is based on a Chinese story and has recently been revised and staged.
    Finally, we expressed our hope that she could visit China again in 1959 for our tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. She smiled and said, "I would like to come and celebrate this festival with the Chinese people."

    和乌兰诺娃的会见
    梅兰芳
    1935年，我第一次访苏的时候，见到杰出的芭蕾舞表演艺术家乌兰诺娃，就看过她的“天鹅湖”。十七年后，1952年中苏友好月，她到中国来访问，我又看到了她的精采的舞剧，那一次她还参观了首都的中国戏曲学校，当学生在排演场练工的时候，我向她具体地介绍了中国古典戏曲演员学艺的过程，我们的学生表演白蛇传给她看，最后大家一起在舞台上照了相。
    苏联的戏剧家都欣赏中国戏里面虚拟的骑马、划船、上楼、下桥的动作，以及多变的手势。在中苏友好月的联欢日子里，我招待苏联文艺界，演出“醉酒”。当我演毕卸装时，乌兰诺娃到后台向我道乏，她说：“我非常喜欢中国戏里的手势，像‘醉酒’虽然穿的是宫庭服装，有长袖掩盖着双手，但是您偶尔有几个露手的动作是那么有着强烈的、醉人的吸引力。”她拉着我的手仔细地看，最后她说：“您的手，还是和一般演员的手差不多，没有什么秘密。”
    1952年的岁末，我从到维也纳参加世界和平大会的归途中经过莫斯科，受到苏联保卫和平委员会的招待，度过了1953年的新年。下车的时候，首先看到乌兰诺娃同志在人丛中走到我的面前，向我道辛苦，并祝贺我参加世界和平大会的胜利归来，她们送我上了汽车。事后苏联的一位能说中国话的记者告诉我：“近年来乌兰诺娃同志为了保持她的表演的完整饱满，对于身体的休养，特别注意，因此轻易不到车站和机场迎送宾客，这次到车站来欢迎梅先生，可以看出你们友谊的深厚。”
    1957年11月，我国劳动人民代表团到莫斯科，下了飞机就参加苏联最高苏维埃庆祝十月革命四十周年的会议，听到了苏联领导同志和兄弟国家的代表们，还有我们毛主席的祝词，对于十月革命为人类造福的重大意义都作了精进的阐发，这些响亮的声音，打到每一个人的心弦上。在红场观礼台上，看到了社会主义先进工作者的壮阔雄伟的步伐，行列中的多种多样的火箭，吸引了所有的观礼者。我们还看到了苏联的人造卫星，这与第一颗人造卫星是姊妹，现在陈列在天文馆里。在这样庄严、隆重、狂欢的节日里，大家除了开会、参观的集体活动之外，我们还忙里偷闲到苏联文艺界的朋友的家庭里作客，在好客的木偶剧院院长奥帕拉兹卓夫家里，在作家波列伏依家里，受到他们亲切的招待。西蒙诺夫同志在百忙中也赶到波列伏依家和我们叙首，还有几次富有诗意的文酒小会，都充满了友好与欢乐。在这篇短文里我想着重谈谈我再次和乌兰诺娃的会见。
    在一次晚会上，我又看到乌兰诺娃的一个短的舞剧，她的精湛的表演，可以说是“状如明月、体似轻风”。使我想起中国古书上所说的赵飞燕能作掌上舞，但无从看到这种古代的舞蹈，今天仿佛出现在我们的面前了。
    另一天她演一个大型舞剧“红罂粟花”，事先我没有知道，临时找不到入场券，我通过接待的单位表示要访问她，经过联系后，约定在莫斯科大剧院见面。我听说她还经常到大剧院的舞台上练工，大约她不愿放弃一天的练习，所以在那里会客。
    我顺便在这里介绍一下芭蕾舞演员的艺术生活。芭蕾舞是一种艰苦的艺术劳动，全身的力量都集中在脚尖上，比到中国古典戏曲里面花旦的支蹻，还要吃力，饮食睡眠，都须严格控制，保持体重的标准。在前几年中苏友好月，苏联文化代表团到中国来访问，大部分团员是坐火车来的，乌兰诺娃却乘坐了飞机，据说，如果接连在火车上生活十天，吃了睡，睡了吃，一则体重会增加、二来就无法练工，对于她是不相宜的。芭蕾舞演员的艺术年龄，一般在三十到四十岁之间，乌兰诺娃早已超过了这个年龄，这是一个奇迹，苏联人民尊之为国宝，不是偶然的。
    前年另一位苏联的芭蕾舞名演员列彼辛斯卡娅到中国来访问，我到北京饭店拜访她，谈了些关于芭蕾舞的表演技术问题。她告诉我，这次随着文化代表团到中国来访问，主要是游历、参观，并不表演，但她每天早晨和晚上，都要花上几十分钟的时间来练习芭蕾舞的基本动作，因为一个月的访华期间，如果缺工不练，在艺术上是一种损失。
    乌兰诺娃曾经说过：“我开始舞蹈生涯之初，技术占了我的主要注意力，占了我绝大部分的时间和精力，但是这种锻炼绝不是朝着杂技的方面发展，而是要提高技术、掌握更多的舞台动作，从动作的连续性和自然的衔接，好像流水一般的转变，具备了这样的能力，才能表现出伟大的感情来，舞蹈才会是概括化并富有诗意的。”
    当我们看到乌兰诺娃表演时，我们不仅欣赏她的卓越的舞蹈技术，而且感觉到，通过这种技术，诗意地表现出人的真挚而深邃的感情。
    在一个清朗天气的上午，我和田汉、老舍、阳翰笙、王昆等几个人到了莫斯科大剧院，乌兰诺娃站在楼梯边欢迎我们走进会客室。
    我把带来的一本彩色套印的“中国戏曲服装图案”送给她，她非常高兴，一边阅看，一边对我说：“图案丰富，色彩鲜明，中国的印刷艺术进步了。”她又说：“当表演完毕，阅看这种有关戏曲美术的书籍，能够调剂精神、恢复疲劳。”
    我又送她一张剧照，是我和姜妙香、葆玖三人合摄的“断桥”。她指着葆玖所扮的青儿说：“这是你的儿子，将来你的孙子长大了，祖孙三代合演一出戏，更有意味，新时代的艺术家是不老的。”
    田汉同志送她一把红色面子的折扇，上面写着一首诗，是歌咏她表演的“红罂粟花”舞剧的，她道了谢，问我看过这出戏没有？我说：“那天因为临时找不到入场券，没有看到你的拿手好戏，非常遗憾。”她谈了些关于排演“红罂粟花”的经验，这个戏是以中国故事为题材的，最近又经过一次修改才上演的。
    最后，我们表示希望她能在1959年我们开国十周年的纪念日，再到中国来访问，她笑着说：“我愿意来和中国人民一同庆祝这个节日。”
