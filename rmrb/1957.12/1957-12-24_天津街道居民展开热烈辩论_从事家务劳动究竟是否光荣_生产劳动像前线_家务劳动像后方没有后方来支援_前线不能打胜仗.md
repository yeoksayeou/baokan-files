Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 22nd: Is engaging in housework glorious? Residents in Tianjin's streets have recently launched a debate on this issue during socialist education.

Some housewives held incorrect views about housework during the Great Leap Forward. For example, some young and middle-aged women believed that "being a housewife is eating exploitative food; it is only glorious to earn money oneself," and some also thought that "housewives only hold children and cook, which is the most useless," and "men can be models for doing work, making great contributions to the country; housewives make no contributions to the country." Many street housewives launched debates on these issues.

The debate focused on questions such as "Is there any future in housework?" and "Does housework have anything to do with building socialism?" The housewives of the Shenjiatai Residents Committee in Nankai District were particularly enthusiastic when discussing these issues. Wang Yuzhen's family of three has a monthly income of just over 30 yuan, which is not very wealthy, but she is able to make ends meet and live comfortably. During the debate, she said: "Who says there is no future in housework? From morning to night, we housewives rely on taking care of the family. As the saying goes: 'If you don't plan, you will be poor.' We not only cook and take care of children, but we have to consider everything, or how can we live?" Everyone also talked about the role of many housewives in this residents' committee. For example, Aunt Li Guifang's son is a weaver and an advanced producer, and her daughter-in-law also works. After the two went to work, Li Guifang took care of their children for them and took good care of them, so that their son and daughter-in-law could work with peace of mind. Aunt Feng Xiuzhen's daughter is a knitting worker. Feng Xiuzhen not only arranges her life well, but also takes good care of her daughter's eating and sleeping, so that her daughter is in good spirits after going to work every day. She has also become an advanced producer in the factory because of her good work performance. These facts have made many people realize that housework and productive labor are like the rear and the front lines. Without good support from the rear, the front lines cannot win battles.

After this debate, everyone believed that doing a good job in housework, especially saving grain, coal, cloth, water, and electricity, and saving more, is the greatest contribution housewives can make to socialism. Many housewives have made plans to be diligent and thrifty in managing their homes. Chen Xianglan, who was originally unwilling to be a housewife and unwilling to participate in social activities, not only made a plan to be diligent and thrifty in managing her home after the debate, but also actively participated in street social work.

    天津街道居民展开热烈辩论
    从事家务劳动究竟是否光荣
    生产劳动像前线　家务劳动像后方没有后方来支援　前线不能打胜仗
    新华社天津22日电　从事家务劳动是否光荣？天津市的街道居民最近在社会主义教育中对这个问题展开了辩论。
    有些家庭妇女在大鸣大放中对家务劳动有不正确的看法。例如有些青壮年妇女认为“当家庭妇女是吃剥削饭，自己赚钱才光荣”，也有的认为“家庭妇女除了抱孩子就是做饭，最没出息”、“男人做工可以当模范，对国家贡献大；家庭妇女对国家没有贡献。”很多街道的家庭妇女便就这些问题开展了辩论。
    辩论集中在“家务劳动有没有出息？”、“家务劳动和建设社会主义有没有关系？”这样几个问题上。南开区沈家台居民委员会的家庭妇女们在讨论这些问题时特别起劲。王玉珍一家三口人每月收入三十多元，并不富余，但她能精打细算，日子过得很松快。她在辩论时说：“谁说家务劳动没出息？从早到晚，挑家过日子全靠咱们家庭妇女，俗话说：计划不到就受穷，咱们不光做饭看孩子，哪一件事都要考虑到，要不然日子怎么过？”大家还谈到这个居民委员会中很多家庭妇女的作用，例如李桂芳大娘的儿子是织布工、先进生产者，儿媳妇也做工，两人上班以后，李桂芳就替他们看孩子，照管得非常好，使儿子、媳妇都能安心生产。冯秀珍大娘的女儿是针织工，冯大娘不但安排好过日子，还照顾好女儿吃、睡，使女儿每天上班后精神愉快，还因为工作成绩好当了工厂的先进生产者。这些事实使很多人认识到：家务劳动和生产劳动就像后方和前线一样，没有后方很好的支援，前线就不能打好仗。
    经过了这一场辩论，大家认为搞好家务劳动特别是节约粮、煤、布、水、电和多储蓄，就是家庭妇女对社会主义最大的贡献。许多家庭妇女制订了勤俭持家的计划。原来不愿意当家庭妇女也不愿参加社会活动的陈香兰经过辩论后，不但订了勤俭持家计划，并且更积极地参加了街道社会工作。
