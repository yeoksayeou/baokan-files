　　The world's first nuclear-powered icebreaker being built by the Soviet Union will be launched within this year. This will be another great contribution of the Soviet Union to world science. Recently, the reporter accompanied the Chinese Labor People's Delegation on a visit to this icebreaker under intense construction.

　　The icebreaker is being built by a famous shipyard with a long history, located on the banks of the Neva River in Leningrad. Factory Party Secretary Orlov and Engineer Balabanov accompanied us on the visit. We walked towards the nuclear-powered icebreaker along the factory grounds filled with deafening sounds of steel hammering and welding machines. We saw this behemoth from afar. It was like a high-rise building under construction, surrounded by dense scaffolding. The exterior of the hull had already been painted. The ship's name "Lenin" was written prominently on the bow in Russian and English.

　　In order to enable us to have a good visit, the enthusiastic hosts first gave us a general introduction to the characteristics of this nuclear-powered icebreaker before entering the noisy site. The icebreaker is 134 meters long, 27.6 meters at its widest point, has a draft of 9.2 meters, a displacement of 16,000 tons, and 44,000 horsepower. It can travel at 18 knots per hour and can break through ice layers two meters thick without much effort. Because this icebreaker is powered by an atomic boiler, it does not need to store the heavy fuel necessary for ordinary ships to travel long distances, and can therefore sail at sea for 400 consecutive days without docking. Ordinary icebreakers can only sail at sea for about two months without docking at most.

　　Subsequently, we stepped onto the deck of the icebreaker by climbing the scaffolding ladder. The first thing that caught our attention was that this ship did not have the chimney indispensable for ordinary ships, because it does not need to burn ordinary fuel, so the chimney is of course dispensed with.

　　The hosts first led us to the stern of the ship. The deck at the stern is a flat area, which is for the take-off and landing of two helicopters. An auxiliary power station is installed inside the stern. We walked slowly towards the middle of the ship. Looking from the deck to the interior of the ship, we saw only a field of scaffolding and dazzling sparks of electric welding. The engineer told us that this is where the heart of the icebreaker is located - the place where the atomic boiler is installed. The atomic reactor here generates a large amount of heat energy, which turns water into high-pressure steam, which drives the turbo generator. Only 45 centimeters of "nuclear fuel" is needed per day and night.

　　During the visit, the hosts also introduced us to the characteristics of various equipment on the ship. Each cabin on the icebreaker accommodates only one or two people. There are 900 rooms of various kinds on the ship, including a bakery, club, music room, library and scientific research room. The lighting equipment uses fluorescent lamps. There is also a moderate artificial climate inside the ship.

　　Then the hosts directed our attention to the bow of the ship. There are restaurants and warehouses there. In addition to storing food for the crew to eat for more than a year, the warehouse can also store fuel for other ships working with the icebreaker. We listened to the engineer's introduction as we walked towards the bow of the ship. At this time, we found that the height difference between the bow and the stern was very large. It turned out that the highest point of the bow was about 20 meters above the water surface, which is equivalent to the height of a five- or six-story building. It is said that this is to meet the needs of icebreaking work.

　　We stood on the towering bow, facing the cold wind from the Neva River and overlooking Leningrad. From here, Leningrad looks extraordinarily beautiful and great.

　　This ship not only has many outstanding advantages, but more importantly, it will open a new era in the history of human transportation. The host told us that the world's first nuclear-powered icebreaker will be launched within this year. After launching, internal installation work will continue. We were puzzled, why is the installation work not completed before launching? The engineer smiled and used a metaphor, saying that the shipyard's slipway is just like a baby's cradle. When the baby can walk a little, the mother will not let him sleep in the cradle, so as to free up the cradle to welcome the second baby. Everyone laughed after hearing his words, and felt even more excited. We believe that we will soon see the second "baby", and he will be stronger and more lovable than the first.

### 参观世界上第一艘原子破冰船

　　参观世界上第一艘原子破冰船
　　新华社记者　沈一鸣
    苏联正在建造的世界上第一艘原子破冰船将在今年年内下水。它将是苏联对世界科学的又一巨大贡献。记者最近随中国劳动人民代表团参观了这艘正在紧张建造中的破冰船。
    承造这艘破冰船的，是列宁格勒濒临涅瓦河的一家有悠久历史的著名造船厂。工厂党委书记奥尔洛夫和工程师巴拉巴诺夫陪同我们参观。我们沿着充满了震耳欲聋的钢铁敲击声和电焊机声的工厂场地向原子破冰船走去。老远我们就看到了这个庞然大物。它像一座正在建造的高层建筑物，四周搭满了密密层层的脚手架。船体外部已经油漆完毕。船头上用俄文和英文写着醒目的船名“列宁”。
    热情的主人为了使我们能很好地参观，在进入嘈杂的现场之前，先给我们概括地介绍了这艘原子破冰船的特点。破冰船长达一百三十四公尺，最宽的地方达二十七点六公尺，吃水九点二公尺，排水量是一万六千吨，有四万四千马力，每小时能驶十八浬，可以不费多大力气破除两公尺厚的冰层，由于这艘破冰船是用原子锅炉来发动的，因此它无须贮备普通船只远航所必需的重量很大的燃料，就可以一连四百天不靠岸在海上航行。普通的破冰船顶多只能在海上不靠岸航行两月左右。
    随后，我们就踏着脚手架的梯子登上了破冰船的甲板。首先使我们注意到的是这艘船没有一般轮船所不可缺少的烟囱，这是因为它不需要烧普通燃料，当然烟囱就免去了。
    主人们先把我们引向船尾。船尾的甲板是一块平坦的场地，它是供两架直升飞机升降用的。船尾内部装有辅助发电站。我们慢慢向船的中部走去。从甲板上向船的内部看去，只见一片脚手架和耀眼的电焊火花。工程师告诉我们说，这里是破冰船的心脏所在——安装原子锅炉的地方。这里的原子反应堆产生出大量热能，把水变成高压蒸气，使涡轮发电机发动起来。一昼夜只需要用四十五公分的“核燃料”。
    在参观过程中，主人们还向我们介绍了这艘船上各种设备的特点。破冰船上每个房舱都只住一两个人。船上一共有各种各样房间九百个，包括面包房、俱乐部、音乐室、图书馆和科学研究室。照明设备用的是日光灯。船内还有适度的人工气候。
    接着主人们把我们的视线引向船头。那里设有餐厅和仓库。仓库里除了可以储备供船上工作人员食用一年多的粮食外，还可以为随同破冰船工作的其他船只贮备燃料。我们一面听着工程师的介绍一面向船头走去。这时发现船头和船尾的高度相差很大。原来船头的最高点离水面约达二十公尺，相当于五、六层楼房的高度。据说，这是为了适应破冰工作的需要。
    我们站在巍峨的船头上，迎着涅瓦河上袭来的寒风眺望列宁格勒。从这儿望去，列宁格勒显得分外美丽、伟大。
    这艘船不仅有许多突出的优点，更重要的是它将要为人类交通运输的历史打开新纪元。主人告诉我们，这艘世界上第一艘原子破冰船年内就要下水。下水以后还将继续进行内部安装工作。我们感到不解，为什么安装工作没有最后完成就下水呢？工程师笑着打比喻说，造船厂的船台正好像婴儿的摇篮，等到婴儿稍能走路时，母亲就不让他睡摇篮了，以便腾出摇篮迎接第二个婴儿。听了他的话大家都笑了，也更感到兴奋。我们相信，不久以后我们就会看到第二个“婴儿”，而且他会比第一个更加壮实，更加可爱。
