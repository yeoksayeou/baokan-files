To my dear brothers:
　　Please allow me, on behalf of the National Council of the Central All-Indonesia Workers' Union, to express my deepest gratitude to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for giving me the opportunity to attend this glorious Congress.
　　It is indeed a great honor for me to be able to meet and have cordial conversations with Chinese brothers—representatives elected and trusted by the Chinese workers, who have rich experience in struggle—on behalf of the Central All-Indonesia Workers' Union. I hope that through all the brothers, I can convey the fraternal respect of the Indonesian workers to the Chinese workers.
　　Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese workers and the entire people have achieved tremendous achievements. The Central All-Indonesia Workers' Union firmly believes that the Chinese workers and the entire people will achieve greater new achievements in socialist transformation and construction. These achievements will not only continue to change the face of China, transforming it from a backward country into an advanced and powerful country in industry and agriculture, will constantly improve the material and cultural living standards of the people, but will also continuously enhance the prestige of socialist countries, and give new impetus to the people of the world, especially those who are struggling to eliminate the outdated remnants of colonialism.
　　Indonesian workers have drawn many experiences from the experience of the Chinese people's liberation struggle. They combined these experiences with the Indonesian people's own national struggle experience, which further promoted the development of the Indonesian people's struggle to strengthen its national independence. Currently, Indonesian workers and people of all strata are fighting to eliminate the Dutch colonial forces. Dutch colonialism still controls Indonesia's economy and still occupies part of the legitimate territory of the Republic of Indonesia, namely West Irian.
　　The struggle for the liberation of West Irian is now in a new development. The Indonesian government has repeatedly tried to resolve the West Irian issue peacefully through the United Nations. Due to the stubborn attitude of the Dutch colonialists, these peaceful efforts have always been frustrated.
　　As the brothers know, the Indonesian government's recent final efforts in the United Nations have again been frustrated. In this way, the United Nations has been used by international imperialists and condoned the Dutch colonialists' occupation of West Irian, turning West Irian into a military base that endangers Indonesia's national independence and world peace, especially Asian peace. The Indonesian government has now expressed its clear attitude, that is, to resolve the West Irian issue through other channels besides the United Nations. This path has already begun. At the call of the Indonesian government, Indonesian workers have held several general strikes in Dutch enterprises. A general boycott of Dutch interests has begun. Indonesian workers support President Sukarno's statement, which emphasizes that if efforts to resolve the West Irian issue in the United Nations are frustrated, measures should be taken against Dutch economic forces.
　　Twelve years ago, when Indonesia declared independence, Dutch colonialists launched two large-scale and barbaric military aggressions in an attempt to strangle the young Republic of Indonesia, but these military aggressions were defeated.
　　Now, the position of the Republic of Indonesia is more consolidated, and the international situation has also undergone tremendous changes. The struggle of the Indonesian people is not isolated. The great victory of the Egyptian people's struggle against the Anglo-French-Israeli military aggression not long ago and the solidarity and courageous attitude shown by the Syrian people in dealing with the provocative actions of the American imperialists have greatly encouraged the Indonesian workers and people. Standing with the Indonesian workers and people are the growing and consolidating international workers' movement, the freedom- and peace-loving Asian-African countries and people, and the socialist countries and people. Therefore, Indonesian workers firmly believe that by strengthening the unity of the people and international support, all measures of Dutch colonialism will be defeated.
　　In order to strengthen the struggle to liberate West Irian, Indonesian workers call on all workers in all countries to condemn any measures taken by Dutch colonialists that endanger Indonesia's national independence and world peace, and hope to take boycott actions against maritime and air transport used by the Netherlands to strengthen its economic and military position in Indonesia.
　　Indonesian workers value and appreciate international support from any aspect for the Indonesian national struggle.
　　Indonesian workers value and appreciate the firm attitude of Chinese workers in supporting the liberation of West Irian. May the friendship between the Indonesian people and the Chinese people be further strengthened.
　　Long live the Chinese workers!
　　Long live the friendship between the Indonesian people and the Chinese people!

### 全印度尼西亚中央职工会总书记  约诺致词

    全印度尼西亚中央职工会总书记
    约诺致词亲爱的兄弟们：
    请允许我以全印度尼西亚中央职工会全国理事会的名义，对中华全国总工会使我有机会参加这个光荣的代表大会，表示万分的感谢。
    我能够代表全印度尼西亚中央职工会同中国兄弟们——具有丰富斗争经验的中国工人选出来的和被信任的代表们——相识和亲切交谈，确实是一种很大的荣誉。我希望通过全体兄弟们把印度尼西亚工人的兄弟般的敬意转达给中国工人。
    在中国共产党的领导下，中国工人和全体人民已经取得了巨大的成就。全印度尼西亚中央职工会深信，中国工人和全体人民将在社会主义改造和建设中取得更大的新的成就。这些成就不仅将继续改变中国的面貌，使它从落后的国家变成为在工业和农业方面先进和强大的国家，将不断地提高人民的物质和文化生活水平，而且也将不断地提高社会主义国家的声誉，并且给予世界人民，特别是正在为消灭已经过时的殖民主义残余而斗争的人民以新的推动力。
    印度尼西亚工人从中国人民解放斗争的经历中吸取了许多经验。他们把这些经验同印度尼西亚人民自己的民族斗争经验结合起来，就进一步地促进了印度尼西亚人民为了加强它的民族独立的斗争的发展。目前，印度尼西亚工人和其他各阶层人民正在为清除荷兰殖民势力而斗争。荷兰殖民主义者仍控制着印度尼西亚的经济，而且仍然占领着印度尼西亚共和国的一部分合法领土，即西伊里安。
    争取西伊里安的解放的斗争，目前正处于新的发展中。印度尼西亚政府曾经一再设法通过联合国以和平方式来解决西伊里安问题。由于荷兰殖民者的顽固态度，这些和平方式的努力始终遭到挫折。
    正如兄弟们所知道的，印度尼西亚政府最近在联合国的最后努力又遭到了挫折。这样一来，联合国就已被国际帝国主义者所利用，并放纵荷兰殖民者占据西伊里安，把西伊里安变为一个危害印度尼西亚民族独立和世界和平首先是亚洲和平的军事基地。目前印度尼西亚政府已经表示了它的明确态度，即通过联合国以外的其他途径来解决西伊里安问题。这个途径已经开始进行。在印度尼西亚政府的号召下，印度尼西亚工人已经在荷兰企业中举行了数次的总罢工。对荷兰利益的总抵制已经开始了。印度尼西亚工人支持苏加诺总统的声明，该声明强调说：如果在联合国解决西伊里安问题的努力遭到挫折，那就应当对荷兰的经济势力采取措施。
    十二年前，当印度尼西亚宣布独立时，荷兰殖民主义者进行了两次大规模的和野蛮的军事侵略，企图扼杀年青的印度尼西亚共和国，但是这些军事侵略都遭到了失败。
    现在，印度尼西亚共和国的地位更加巩固了，国际形势也发生了巨大的变化。印度尼西亚人民的斗争并不是孤立的。埃及人民不久以前击败英、法、以军事侵略的斗争的伟大胜利和叙利亚人民在对付美帝国主义者的挑衅行为中所表现的团结和勇敢的态度，都大大地鼓舞了印度尼西亚工人和人民。同印度尼西亚工人和人民站在一起的，是日益扩大和巩固的国际工人运动、热爱自由与和平的亚非国家和人民以及社会主义国家和人民。因此，印度尼西亚工人深信，通过加强人民的团结和国际支援，荷兰殖民主义的一切措施都将会被击败。
  为了加强解放西伊里安的斗争，印度尼西亚工人呼吁一切国家的所有工人谴责荷兰殖民主义者危害印度尼西亚民族独立和世界和平的任何措施，并且希望对荷兰用于加强它在印度尼西亚的经济和军事地位的海运和空运采取抵制行动。
    印度尼西亚工人重视和感谢来自任何方面的、对印度尼西亚民族斗争所表示的国际支援。
    印度尼西亚工人重视和感谢中国工人支持解放西伊里安的坚决态度。祝印度尼西亚人民和中国人民的友谊进一步加强。
    中国工人万岁！
    印度尼西亚人民和中国人民的友谊万岁！
