All-India Trade Union Congress Delegate
Tangalama's Address

Comrade Chairman:

I bring to the Chinese working people the greetings of goodwill, enthusiasm, and friendship from the Indian working people.

On behalf of the All-India Trade Union Congress and its General Secretary, Comrade Dange, I extend congratulations to the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions.

The great achievements of the Chinese working class in the past historical struggles and in the present period have inspired the Indian working class. We express our gratitude for this. We have learned that this congress will discuss and decide on the specific tasks of the Chinese trade unions during the Second Five-Year Plan. We are confident that it will provide beneficial lessons for our trade union work.

The Indian working class must wage a struggle to win trade union rights and improve living conditions, while at the same time helping with the country's construction work. The correctness of this dual task has been sufficiently demonstrated in the results of the general election in early 1957, with several prominent trade union leaders being elected to the state and central legislatures. In Kerala, a state government including trade union leaders has already been formed.

Our country is currently in the second year of its Second Five-Year Plan. The basic problem facing the Indian working class is the implementation of this plan and the victorious completion of this plan.

As predicted by the Fourth World Trade Union Congress, the problems faced by countries that have already achieved political independence are also the problems faced by the Indian working class. Imperialists are making every effort to undermine this plan. The Indian working class and the Indian people will surely triumph in this struggle.

The Indian people and the Indian government, led by Nehru, are committed to peace based on the Five Principles.

The sincere sympathy expressed by the Chinese people for the death of Dr. Edward, one of India's esteemed sons, is yet another proof of the love and care between us.

I once again congratulate the congress.

Long live the Chinese working class!

Long live the solidarity of the working classes and peoples of India and China!

Long live the solidarity of the international working class!

The people of China and India are brothers!

Long live world peace!

    全印工会大会代表
    唐加马里致词主席同志：
    我给中国劳动人民带来了印度劳动人民的善意、热情与友谊的问候。
    我代表全印工会大会和它的总书记丹吉同志，向中国工会第八次全国代表大会祝贺。
    中国工人阶级在过去的具有历史意义的斗争和在目前时期已经取得的伟大成就，鼓舞了印度工人阶级。我们对此表示感谢。我们得知，这一次代表大会将讨论和决定中国工会在第二个五年计划期间的具体任务。我们确信，它将给我们的工会工作以有益的经验教训。
    印度工人阶级必须进行争取工会权利和改善生活条件的斗争，同时又必须帮助国家的建设工作。这个双重任务的正确性已经在1957年初的大选的结果中得到充足证明，有几个著名的工会领导人被选入邦与中央的议会。在克拉拉邦，已经成立了包括工会领袖在内的邦政府。
    我们国家目前正处在第二个五年计划的第二年。印度工人阶级面临的基本问题就是实现这个计划和胜利完成这个计划。
    正如世界工会第四次代表大会所预料的，已经获得政治独立的国家所面临的问题也就是印度工人阶级所面临的问题。帝国主义者正在竭力企图破坏这个计划。印度工人阶级和印度人民在这场斗争中一定会胜利。
    印度人民和以尼赫鲁为首的印度政府致力于以五项原则为基础的和平。
    中国人民对印度可敬的儿子之一爱德华博士的逝世所表示的真挚同情，又一次证明了我们之间的友爱和关怀。
    我再一次祝贺大会。
    中国工人阶级万岁！
    印度与中国的工人阶级和人民的团结万岁！
    国际工人阶级团结万岁！
    中印人民是兄弟！
    世界和平万岁！
