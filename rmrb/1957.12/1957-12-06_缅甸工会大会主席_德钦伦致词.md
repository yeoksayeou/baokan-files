Chairman, fellow delegates:

　　Please allow me, on behalf of the entire working class of Burma, to extend friendly and solidarity greetings to you—the Chinese delegates attending the historic 8th National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions—and, through you, to the entire Chinese working class.

　　The Burmese working class is deeply honored to have received the invitation from the Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to send friendly representatives to the 8th National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, and we express our heartfelt gratitude.

　　For centuries, China and Burma have been friendly neighbors, living together in close harmony, a clear historical fact. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, proposed and established by the Prime Ministers of China and Burma, have further consolidated the friendship already established between the two countries.

　　In particular, the friendly unity between the Chinese and Burmese working classes is developing and strengthening year by year. No enemy can destroy or undermine this friendly unity. The Burmese working class resolutely safeguards the unity between the workers of China and Burma, and strives to prevent and thwart any harmful acts that undermine this unity.

　　Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese working class bravely overcame many difficulties and underwent arduous revolutionary struggles before achieving the victory of liberation. This is not only a victory for the world's working class but also a great victory for the oppressed working class of all Asia, and it has also contributed to the peace and security of the Asian people by destroying the foundations of the colonial system's rule and exploitation in vast areas of Asia for many centuries.

　　The history of the new China, which has achieved victory for the working class, is undergoing many unprecedented and astonishing changes. We see new political, economic, and social systems constantly achieving successes and victories. You are safeguarding your independence, peace, and justice with national unity. The fraternal Burmese working class rejoices in the victory of the Chinese working class. We firmly believe that your efforts, your experience, and your new victories will continue to be extremely beneficial to the Burmese working class.

　　We are especially grateful that we have learned from you valuable experiences and examples in establishing working-class unity, which is of great significance to the working class, and in defending the rights of trade unions, while you have made tremendous efforts to safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

　　The entire Burmese working class heartily congratulates you on your rapid victories in various undertakings to actively build a new socialist society in a short period.

　　Please accept this gift from the Burmese working class, symbolizing solidarity and friendship, in commemoration of the friendly unity between the working classes of China and Burma.

　　May the 8th National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions be successful!

　　Long live the Chinese working class!

　　Long live the unity of the workers of China and Burma!

　　Long live the unity of the workers of the world!

　　Long live world peace!

　  缅甸工会大会主席
　　德钦伦致词主席、各位代表：
    请允许我代表缅甸全体工人群众向你们——出席具有历史意义的中国工会第八次全国代表大会的中国代表们，并且通过你们向中国全体工人群众致以友好和团结的祝贺。
    缅甸工人群众非常荣幸地接到中华全国总工会主席邀请我们派遣友好的代表参加中国工会第八次全国代表大会的请帖，谨表示衷心的感谢。
    几百年以来，中缅两国一直是友好的邻邦，亲密相处，这是明显的历史事实。中缅两国总理提出和确定的国际关系的基本原则——五项原则，更加巩固了两国之间已经建立起来的友谊。
    特别是，中国工人群众和缅甸工人群众之间的友好团结正在逐年发展和巩固。任何敌人都不能摧毁和破坏这种友好团结。缅甸工人群众坚决地维护中缅两国工人的团结，尽力防止和粉碎破坏团结的任何危害行为。
    中国工人阶级在中国共产党的正确领导下，英勇地克服了许多困难，经历了艰苦的革命斗争，然后取得了解放的胜利。这不仅是世界工人阶级的胜利，也是亚洲全体被压迫工人阶级的伟大胜利，并且由于它摧毁了许多世纪以来殖民主义制度在亚洲广大土地上的统治和剥削的基础，从而也为亚洲人民的和平和安全作出了贡献。
    工人阶级取得了胜利的新中国的历史，正在发生着许多空前惊人的变化。我们看到新的政治、经济和社会制度不断地获得了成就和胜利。你们正以全民族的团结维护着自己的独立、和平和正义。兄弟般的缅甸全体工人群众为中国工人阶级的胜利而欢呼。我们坚信，你们所作的努力、你们的经验和你们的新的胜利，对缅甸工人群众一直具有极其有益的作用。
    特别使我们感激的是，我们从你们那里学到建立对工人阶级具有重要意义的工人阶级的团结，和保卫工会权利的可贵的经验和榜样，同时你们对保卫亚洲和世界和平作了巨大的努力。
    缅甸全体工人群众衷心地祝贺你们，在积极建设社会主义新社会的各项事业中，能在短期内迅速获得胜利。
    请接受缅甸工人群众为纪念中缅两国工人阶级的友好团结而赠送的表达团结和友好精神的礼物。
    祝中国工会第八次全国代表大会成功！
    中国工人阶级万岁！
    中缅两国工人团结万岁！
    世界工人团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
