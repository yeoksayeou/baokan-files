　　Fewer People, More Housing Shortage?
    What is the Reason?
　　Please Reply, Shenyang Railway Bureau

　　Since the liberation of Shenyang, the leading organs of the Shenyang garrison have shared a building with the Shenyang Railway Bureau. Based on the situation in recent years, it has been very suitable, and both parties have had enough rooms. However, recently, according to our management department, the Shenyang Railway Bureau, under the pretext of expanding the bureau after the abolition of railway sub-bureaus nationwide, wants to take back the rooms we are currently using and instead have the railway bureau spend more than 3.2 million yuan to build a new building for us elsewhere. In this way, both parties will exclusively use a large building, which of course will be very convenient.

    However, we saw on November 21st in the Liaoning Daily: "According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th...After the abolition of railway sub-bureaus, in addition to the newly established bureaus, the existing bureau's organizations will not only not expand, but will also be streamlined, and various departments will be appropriately merged. The management personnel of the bureau (including those from abolished sub-bureaus) will be reduced by 30% to 50%." Therefore, we believe that the Shenyang Railway Bureau's approach is inconsistent with the facts reported in the newspaper. Even if the personnel increase, considering the current situation where departments are mobilizing family members to return to their hometowns and cadres are being sent to lower levels during rectification, the Shenyang Railway Bureau can completely accommodate the existing rooms by making some adjustments. Is it not a waste to ask us to build another large building? This is contrary to our current policy of building the country through diligence and frugality. We know that this expenditure is equivalent to the total value of one year's labor for 15,000 farmers, which can support the lives of more than 53,000 people for a year. Such a large amount of expenditure cannot be ignored. We do not know where this expenditure will be paid from and whether it has been approved by the national construction department?

    Even if this expenditure is paid from the Ministry of Railways' own profits or enterprise funds, it is inappropriate. If the Ministry of Railways' profits and enterprise funds are excessive, they can be turned over to the state as funds for national economic construction, investing in industrial construction and agricultural construction. This is much more beneficial to the country than building unnecessary non-productive buildings.

### 人越少房越缺  是何缘故？请沈阳铁路管理局答复

　　人越少房越缺
    是何缘故？
　　请沈阳铁路管理局答复
    沈阳驻军领导机关从沈阳解放以来，就和沈阳铁路管理局合用一座楼房。根据几年来的情况看，是十分合适的，双方房间都够用。但最近据我们管理部门讲，沈阳铁路管理局借在全国撤销铁路分局后扩大管理局为名，要将我们现用的房间要去，另由铁路局拿出三百二十余万元让我们在其他地方盖新房。这样，两家都独用一座大楼，当然是很方便的。
    但我们于11月21日辽宁日报上看到：“据新华社北京20日电……撤销铁路分局以后，除新增设几个管理局外，现有管理局的机构不仅不扩大，而且还要加以紧缩，各个部门还要适当合并，管理局机关的管理人员（包括撤销分局在内）要减少30％到50％。”因此，我们认为沈阳铁路管理局的做法与报上所载的事实不符。退一步说，即使人员增加，根据现在各部门在整改中动员家属还乡，干部下放的情况看，沈阳铁路管理局将现有房间很好地调整一下，也是完全可以容纳得下的。要我们另建大楼，岂不是浪费吗？这是与我们当前勤俭建国的方针相违背的。我们知道，这笔经费相当于一万五千个农民一年劳动的总值，可供五万三千多人生活一年。这样大的一笔经费，是不可忽视的。我们不知道这笔经费将由何处开支，是否经过国家建设部门批准？
    这笔经费要是由铁道部自己的利润或企业基金内支付，也是不应当的。如果铁道部的利润和企业基金过多，可以上缴国家，作为国家经济建设资金，投入工业建设和农业建设上去。这比建设不必要的非生产性的大楼，对国家有利得多。
