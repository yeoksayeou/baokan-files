Notes

    The Sorrow of a "Hooked Fish"
    Recently, the Philippines' financial economy has fallen into serious difficulties again. The Philippines has surpassed New York to become the place with the highest cost of living in the world. Although the Philippine authorities have adopted "belt-tightening" measures, the situation has not improved but has become more serious.
    Faced with this cruel reality, the Governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines, Mr. Cuaderno, admitted that an important reason for the economic difficulties was "the unfavorable trade with the United States and the excessive import of luxury goods from the United States." In a word, it is suffering from the United States.
    For many years, the Philippines has been receiving "aid" from the United States, but facts have proved that this "aid" is just a bait. The Philippines' current situation is drawing the sorrow of a "hooked fish."

    “上钩的鱼”的悲哀
    近来菲律宾的财政经济又陷于严重的困难境地。菲律宾已经超过纽约而成为世界上生活费用最高的地方。菲律宾当局虽然采取了“勒紧裤带”的措施，但是情况不但没有好转，反而更加严重了。
    在这个残酷的现实面前，菲律宾中央银行行长卡德诺承认，经济困难的重要原因是“同美国贸易处于不利地位，同时从美国输入过多的奢侈品”。一句话，就是受了美国的害。
    多年以来，菲律宾一直接受美国“援助”，但事实证明，这种“援助”不过是一种钓饵。菲律宾今天的处境正画出了一条“上钩的鱼”的悲哀。
