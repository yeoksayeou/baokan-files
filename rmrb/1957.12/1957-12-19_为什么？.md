Why?

　　Why does milk go sour?
　　Fresh milk is a fragrant, sweet, and nutritious food. However, if milk is left for a long time, it tastes sour and contains white, lumpy solids, making it unappetizing. To understand why milk turns sour, you first need to know what substances it contains. The average composition of milk is as follows:
    Water　87％
    Casein (a type of protein) 3.3％
    Milk fat　4.0％
    Lactose　5.0％
    Minerals　0.7％
    Milk turns sour because of the action of microorganisms that invade it. The seeds of these microorganisms are called enzymes. Enzymes are everywhere in the air, dust, saliva, and unclean things. When the environment is suitable (such as a certain temperature), these seeds grow and reproduce in the milk, turning the lactose into lactic acid. This change is called milk fermentation. Lactic acid is a sour-tasting liquid, so the milk turns sour. After the milk turns sour, the casein also coagulates into lumps, so white solids precipitate. Keeping milk clean or refrigerated can prevent the growth and reproduction of enzymes, delaying the time it takes for milk to sour and spoil. Boiling the milk kills all the microorganisms in it, so the milk can also be kept longer. (Lun)
    Why are frozen persimmons thawed in cold water?
    Persimmons are one of the inexpensive and nutritious fruits of winter. When the weather is very cold, the persimmons you buy are often frozen solid. How do you thaw frozen persimmons? Impatient people may want to put the frozen persimmons in hot or warm water to thaw them. But experienced people will tell you that persimmons thawed in this way don't taste good. First, they are neither cold nor hot, so they are not refreshing; more importantly, the persimmon skin is a semi-permeable membrane, and the water outside can seep into the persimmon through the skin, so the persimmon is not as sweet as it was originally.
    To thaw frozen persimmons, it is best to soak them in cold water. This not only thaws them quickly but also tastes good. Because the freezing point of persimmons is much lower than the freezing point of water, when you put persimmons in cold water, the water around the persimmons also drops in temperature and freezes into ice. This ice shell protects the persimmons, preventing water from seeping in; on the other hand, it can also continuously conduct heat from the water to the persimmons, so the persimmons thaw quickly and taste good.

专栏：为什么？

　　为什么？
　　牛奶为什么会变酸
    鲜牛奶是具有芬香甜味，营养丰富的东西。但是，牛奶放久了，就觉得有酸味，并且还有白色块状的固体，很难吃。要知道牛奶怎么变酸了？先得知道牛奶中含有那些物质。牛奶的平均成份如下：
    水　87％
    酪素（一种蛋白质）3.3％
    乳油　4.0％
    乳糖　5.0％
    矿物质　0.7％
    牛奶变酸，是因为一种微生物侵入奶内，发生作用的结果。这种微生物的种子称做酶。酶在空气中、尘土中、吐沫中以及不洁的东西上到处都有。此类种子当环境适宜时（如一定温度等），就在奶中生长繁殖，将乳糖变成乳酸。这种变化叫做乳类发酵。乳酸是一种具有酸味的液体，所以牛奶也就变酸了。牛奶发酸后，酪素也随着凝结成块，所以有白色固体沉下。保持牛奶的清洁或冷藏，可以防止酶的生长繁殖，推迟牛奶发酸变质的时间。把牛奶煮开，将牛奶中的一切微菌都杀死，牛奶也可以放得久些。　（伦）
    冻柿子为什么要用凉水化
    柿子是冬季既便宜又富营养的水果之一。在天气很冷的时候，买来的柿子常常是冻得硬崩崩的。怎样使冻柿子化开呢？性急的人也许想把冻柿子放在热水或温水里化。但是有经验的人会告诉你，这样解冻后的柿子不好吃。一则是不冷不热吃着不爽口；更重要的是柿子皮是个半透膜，外面的水能通过表皮渗入柿子内，柿子就不像原来那么甜了。
    要想将冻柿子化开，最好是将它浸在冷水里。这样不但解冻快，而且味道好。因为柿子冻结的温度比水结冰的温度低得多，将柿子放入冷水后，柿子周围的水也随着降低了温度，以致结成了冰。这冰壳一方面保护着柿子，阻止了水的渗入；另一方面还能继续不断将热由水传导给柿子，所以柿子很快就解冻了，而且味道也好。　（黄春辉）
