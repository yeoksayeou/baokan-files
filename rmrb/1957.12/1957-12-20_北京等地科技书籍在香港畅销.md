Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, December 19th: Science and technology books published in Beijing and other places are welcomed in Hong Kong. According to the Hong Kong Commercial Press, the general distributor of natural science and applied technology books, in recent years, the variety of science and technology books sold from Beijing to Hong Kong has increased nearly two times compared with before 1949, reaching more than 5,000 kinds.

Hong Kong workers welcome the worker loose-leaf learning materials and books on applied technologies such as automobile construction and repair published in Beijing and other places. Many farmers and people engaged in farm work are very interested in the agricultural technology and poultry farming pamphlets published in Beijing and other places. The bookstores that sell these books are often unable to meet the demand. After the successful launch of the Soviet artificial satellite, books published in Beijing and other places introducing artificial satellites, rockets, and atomic energy were very popular in Hong Kong.
