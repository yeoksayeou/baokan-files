Xinhua News Agency, London, December 16th:
　　Bulganin's letters to Western governments have had a very strong impact on the British public. Many British newspapers sharply criticized the United States for lacking any political creativity and merely wanting to turn Western Europe into its missile base.
　　Today's "News Chronicle" published the results of a public opinion poll showing that British people, regardless of party affiliation, generally believe that top-level East-West talks are more important than a nuclear arms race. Of the opinions received by this newspaper from Conservative, Labor, and Liberal party members participating in the poll, 85% favored Western leaders meeting with Soviet leaders to discuss outstanding differences. They advocated not allowing the United States to have rocket bases in Britain or West Germany, not allowing American planes carrying hydrogen bombs to patrol, and demanded the withdrawal of foreign troops from East and West Germany.
　　The Sunday newspaper "Reynolds News" strongly urged that Bulganin's proposals not be rejected, and that talks with the Soviet Union be initiated to prepare for a top-level meeting. It said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting is working on a hopelessly short-sighted plan. The purpose of this meeting is purely military, but what is more urgently needed now is new political consideration.
　　The "Times," in an editorial entitled "Weapons Are Not Everything," agreed with George Kennan's view that Western countries should abandon their persistent view that the response to communism is primarily military. Kennan also called on the heads of Western governments meeting in Paris to spend more time and talent discussing the endless competition in political and economic aspects.
　　The Conservative Party's "Daily Mail" said in today's editorial that if European countries allow the United States to establish missile launch sites, they are automatically accepting the risk of war. It said that Western European countries will ask the United States if it has any suggestions to deal with Bulganin's proposals. Bulganin's proposals are extremely tempting to Western European countries.
　　Frank Cousins, General Secretary of Britain's largest trade union, the Transport and General Workers' Union, spoke on the television "Question and Answer" program, supporting Bulganin's proposal to establish a zone in Central Europe where no atomic weapons are stored. He said, "If there is anything that can ease tensions, we should adopt it."

### 苏联和平倡议激动英国人心  民意测验表明大多数人主张东西方会谈

　　苏联和平倡议激动英国人心
    民意测验表明大多数人主张东西方会谈
    新华社伦敦16日电　布尔加宁给西方各国政府的信件对于英国公众有非常强烈的影响，许多英国报纸尖锐抨击美国缺乏任何政治创见，而只是在想把西欧变成它的导弹基地。
    今天的“新闻纪事报”公布的民意测验结果表明，不分政党的英国人民普遍认为东西方的最高级会谈比核军备竞赛更为重要。这家报纸从保守党、工党和自由党那里收到的参加民意测验的人的意见中，有85％赞成西方领袖同苏联领袖会晤来讨论悬而未决的各种分歧。他们主张不让美国在英国或者西德拥有火箭基地，不许载有氢弹的美国飞机巡逻，并且要求从东西德撤出外国军队。
    星期日报纸“雷诺新闻”竭力要求不要拒绝布尔加宁的建议，而着手同苏联会谈以准备最高级会议。它说，北大西洋公约组织会议正在一个毫无希望的目光短浅的计划上工作。这个会议的目的纯粹是军事性的，但是目前更加迫切需要的是新的政治上的考虑。
    “泰晤士报”在以“武器并非一切”为题的一篇社论中表示同意乔治·凯南的看法，凯南认为，西方国家应当摆脱他们那种死抱着不放的看法，认为对共产主义的答复主要是军事性的。凯南还要求在巴黎举行会议的西方各国政府首脑以更多的时间和才智来讨论在政治和经济方面作无穷无尽的竞赛。
    保守党的“每日邮报”今天的社论说，如果欧洲国家允许美国建立导弹发射基地，它们就是自动地接受了战争的危险。它说，西欧国家将会问美国是否有建议来应付布尔加宁的建议。布尔加宁的建议对西欧国家是极有诱惑力的。
    英国最大的工会——运输与不熟练工人工会总书记弗兰克·卡曾兹在电视“问与答”节目中发表演说，支持布尔加宁提出的关于在中欧建立一个不贮存原子武器的地区的建议。他说：“如果有什么足以缓和紧张局势，我们就应当采纳它。”
