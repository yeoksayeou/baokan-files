Notes

    Land of Happiness and Scorched Earth

    In his Christmas address, Eisenhower said that he "hoped the world would become a better land of happiness for everyone."

    However, at the NATO summit a few days earlier, he forced the American missile base plan on the people of Western Europe as a Christmas gift. This plan, as some newspapers in Western Europe have pointed out, will turn Western Europe into scorched earth for the sake of American interests.

    The people of Western Europe, as the American President said in his Christmas address, do indeed hope to live in a "better land of happiness." To achieve this goal, they will first strengthen their struggle against the American missile base plan that threatens to turn Western Europe into scorched earth.

    乐土和焦土
    艾森豪威尔在圣诞节祝词中说，他“希望世界总得成为大家的更美好的乐土”。
    但是，在几天以前的北大西洋集团首脑会议上，他却把美国的导弹基地计划作为圣诞节礼物硬塞给西欧人民。这个计划，正如西欧国家的一些报纸所指出的，将使西欧因为美国的利益而变成焦土。
    西欧人民的确像美国总统在圣诞节祝词中所说的那样，都希望生活在“更美好的乐土”上。为了达到这个目的，他们首先将加强斗争，来反对使西欧有变成焦土危险的美国导弹基地计划。
