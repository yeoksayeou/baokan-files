    据新华社13日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科12日讯：苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅12日设宴招待以叙利亚副总理兼国防部长阿泽姆为首的叙利亚政府代表团。
    马利诺夫斯基和阿泽姆在宴会上相互致词。
    马利诺夫斯基在讲话中说，最近的事件表明，叙利亚人民在争取自己的自由和独立的正义斗争中，并不是孤独的，他们有着全世界爱好和平的人民和苏联人民作他们的忠诚无私的朋友。苏联人民高兴的是，苏叙两国人民的友好关系正在一天天巩固和发展，而这种友好关系是符合两国人民的利益，符合巩固中近东的和平和安全的利益的。
    阿泽姆在讲话中感谢苏联在巩固叙利亚经济和国防上所给予的帮助。他说，在土耳其军队集结在我国边境的惊恐不安的日子里，我们也相信你们的同情和友谊。
    阿泽姆又说，我们不希望我们的国家成为帝国主义侵略者的基地或通行地。现在叙利亚人民和叙利亚军队在阿拉伯人民争取自由和民族独立的斗争中走在斗争的最前面。在我们的斗争中我们不是孤立的。
