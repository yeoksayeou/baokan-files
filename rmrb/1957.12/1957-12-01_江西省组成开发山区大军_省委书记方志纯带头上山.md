Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 29th - A mighty army to develop mountainous areas in Jiangxi Province has been organized, and the vanguard, led by Fang Zichun, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, has recently departed for the mountains. This first group of cadres includes twenty-two directors and deputy directors of departments and bureaus, such as Lai Shaoyao, Deputy Director of the Industrial and Transportation Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, and Peng Zhenxing, Director of the Forestry Department of the Provincial People's Committee. They will respectively serve as the directors or Party Committee Secretaries of the twelve comprehensive agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery reclamation farms and forestry, animal husbandry, and agricultural reclamation farms that are about to be established. The vanguard also includes a large number of cadres such as section chiefs and division chiefs.

The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee have held many meetings in succession in recent days to study the comprehensive development of mountainous areas and the march into mountainous areas. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have decided to immediately begin establishing five comprehensive agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery reclamation farms and seven forestry, animal husbandry, and agricultural reclamation farms throughout the province. Each farm will operate on approximately 100,000 mu of land and will be staffed with 300 to 500 cadres. The tasks of the reclamation farms are to comprehensively develop mountainous areas, develop diverse mountain production in accordance with local conditions, and be responsible for supporting and guiding the production of surrounding agricultural cooperatives and forestry cooperatives, becoming the core force in building economically, culturally, progressive, and prosperous mountainous areas.

At the same time, a wave of enthusiasm for going up the mountains has been set off in provincial-level agencies and enterprises in Jiangxi. Big-character posters saying "March into the Mountains" and "Settle Down in the Mountains" are plastered on the walls of various agencies and units, expressing the determination of the vast number of cadres to develop and build the mountainous areas. According to statistics from twenty-eight provincial-level agencies, more than 80% of the total number of cadres have signed up to go to the countryside and the mountains to participate in labor.

After the vanguard reaches the mountainous areas, more than 5,000 cadres in the follow-up troops will successively depart for the mountainous areas.

　　省委书记方志纯带头上山
    新华社南昌29日电　江西省开发山区的大军已经组成，先头部队在中共江西省委书记方志纯率领下最近已经开往山区。这批首先上山的干部中，包括中共省委工业交通部副部长赖绍尧和省人民委员会林业厅厅长彭振兴等二十二个正副厅长和局长。他们将分别担任即将建立的十二个农林牧渔综合垦区场和林牧农垦区场的场长或党委书记。先头部队中还包括有处长、科长等大批干部。
    中共江西省委和江西省人民委员会这几天连续召开了许多会议，研究全面开发山区和向山区进军的问题。省委与省人民委员会决定，立即着手在全省建立五个农林牧渔综合垦区场和七个林牧农垦区场。每个场的经营范围在十万亩土地左右，配备干部三百名到五百名。垦区场的任务是：全面开发山区，因地制宜地发展山区多种生产，并且负责扶持和指导周围农业合作社和林业合作社的生产，成为建设社会主义的经济上文化上进步繁荣的山区的核心力量。
    与此同时，江西省级机关和各企业单位已掀起了上山的热潮。“向山区进军”、“到山区去安家落户”的大字报，贴满了各机关各单位的墙壁，表达了广大干部开发山区和建设山区的决心。据省级机关二十八个单位的统计，报名下乡上山参加劳动的干部，占干部总数的80％以上。
    在先头部队到达山区之后，后续部队的五千多名干部，将陆续开往山区。
