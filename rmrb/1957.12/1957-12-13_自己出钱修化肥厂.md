　　The agricultural cooperatives in nine counties of the Suining Special District in Sichuan Province have decided to pay for the construction of a chemical fertilizer plant with an annual output of 10,000 tons themselves. The state will provide some financial assistance to the agricultural cooperatives and provide technical assistance.
　　When the news of the approval for the construction of the factory was released, the farmers were very excited. The agricultural cooperatives in Shehong County decided to contribute 350,000 yuan this year, and six agricultural cooperatives, including Zheng Sheng, Beidi, and Xinsheng in Santai County, also decided to withdraw 13,000 yuan from the public accumulation fund to support the construction of the factory. The site of the factory has been determined to be within Shehong County, and the state has sent engineering and technical personnel to conduct surveys and designs, and is working intensively on construction preparations.

　　自己出钱修化肥厂
    四川遂宁专区九个县的农业社，决定自己出钱修建一座年产万吨的化学肥料厂。国家特补助农业社部分资金，并在技术上给以援助。
    当上级批准建厂的消息传出后，农民们非常兴奋。射洪县全县农业社决定在今年内拿出三十五万元资金，三台县铮胜、北地、新生等六个农业社也决定在公积金里抽出一万三千元去支援建厂。这个厂的厂址确定在射洪县境内，国家已派出工程技术人员前去勘查设计，并在紧张地进行施工准备工作。
