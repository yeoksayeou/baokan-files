　　整社后的新气象
    辽宁省义县先进农业社，在以粮食问题为中心的两条道路的大辩论之后，即转入了整社工作。这个社根据社员对干部和社的经营管理提出的意见和建议，首先整顿了干部的思想作风，并根据民主办社、勤俭办社的方针，订立了各项制度，改进了经营管理工作。
    经过整社。这个社出现了前所未有的新气象：干部作风转变了，干群关系更密切了，社员的生产热情更为高涨，劳动出勤率由过去的40％增加到90％以上。合作社更加巩固了。（附图片）
　　整社后，社干部都分别到各生产队参加生产领导生产。这是社主任郑江（前）和社员一起搬运石头修水库。
　　整社后，社员们“爱社如家”的思想大大提高了。这头牲口的腿有毛病，饲养员陈殿发（后）嘱咐社员使用时要注意。　新华社记者
