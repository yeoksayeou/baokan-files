Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Indonesian people's struggle to recover West Irian is a just struggle, and a just struggle is bound to be victorious. In this just struggle, the Chinese people will always be the loyal friends of the Indonesian people.

Premier Zhou met with Suwito, a reporter from the Indonesian Antara News Agency stationed in Beijing, on the evening of the 12th and had a conversation with him.

In his conversation with Suwito, Premier Zhou first expressed his condolences once again regarding President Sukarno's escape from danger. The Premier said: This assassination plot was not only aimed at President Sukarno himself, but also at all patriotic forces in Indonesia that cherish national interests. The conspirators did not succeed this time, but the organizers and supporters of this conspiracy fully exposed their ferocious faces. The Indonesian people will surely learn a lesson from this incident, become more vigilant, and more firmly fight to safeguard national interests.

Premier Zhou said: The recent issue of West Irian once again proves that as long as the United Nations continues to be manipulated by the imperialist bloc, it cannot play its due role and will inevitably lose its prestige more and more. Although Indonesia's just demands did not receive the support of a two-thirds majority at the United Nations General Assembly, in terms of population, the vast majority of the world stands on Indonesia's side. President Sukarno said well at the mass meeting in Surabaya yesterday (11th) that the Indonesian people’s struggle to recover West Irian is a just struggle, and a just struggle will surely be victorious.

Premier Zhou said: The Indonesian government's recent actions to take over Dutch enterprises in Indonesia are legitimate and reasonable. According to news reports, the US government is exerting pressure in an attempt to make the Indonesian government abandon this action. From this, we can see what the so-called "neutrality" adopted by the United States when the United Nations General Assembly voted on the West Irian issue was all about. News also reports that the North Atlantic Group will discuss the actions taken by the Indonesian government, based on its own sovereignty, against Dutch enterprises in Indonesia at its upcoming meeting. From this, we can not only see the nature of the North Atlantic Group, but also further recognize the nature of all military blocs led by the United States.

Premier Zhou finally said: The struggle against colonialism and to safeguard national independence is an arduous and tortuous struggle. However, we believe that no matter what kind of hardships and twists and turns, they will not scare the Indonesian people. On the contrary, they will make the Indonesian people stronger. In this just struggle, the Chinese people will always be the loyal friends of the Indonesian people.

    周恩来总理向印度尼西亚记者说
    收复西伊里安的斗争一定胜利
    中国人民永远是印度尼西亚人民的忠实朋友
    新华社13日讯　周恩来总理说，印度尼西亚人民收复西伊里安的斗争是正义的斗争，正义的斗争是一定要胜利的。在这个正义的斗争中，中国人民永远是印度尼西亚人民的忠实朋友。
    周总理在12日晚间接见了印度尼西亚安塔拉通讯社驻北京记者苏维多，同他进行了谈话。
    周总理在同苏维多的谈话中，首先对于苏加诺总统的脱险，再一次表示慰问。总理说：这一次暗害的阴谋，不仅针对着苏加诺总统本人，而且是针对着印度尼西亚国内一切珍视民族利益的爱国力量。这一次阴谋者没有得逞，但是这一阴谋的主持者和支持者却充分暴露了他们的凶恶面貌。印度尼西亚人民一定会从这一事件中得出教训，更加提高警惕，更加坚定地为维护民族利益而斗争。
    周总理说：最近在西伊里安问题上再一次证明，只要联合国继续在帝国主义集团的操纵下，它就不能发挥它应起的作用，并且不可避免地越来越丧失它的威信。印度尼西亚的正义主张虽然没有在联合国大会上得到三分之二多数的支持，但是，就人口来说，全世界的绝大多数是站在印度尼西亚这一边的。苏加诺总统昨天（11日）在泗水的群众大会上说得好，印度尼西亚人民收复西伊里安的斗争是正义的斗争，正义的斗争是一定会胜利的。
    周总理说：印度尼西亚政府最近采取的接管在印度尼西亚的荷兰企业的行动，是正当的、合理的。根据消息报道，美国政府正在施加压力，企图使印度尼西亚政府放弃这一行动。从这里，我们可以看出，联合国大会对西伊里安问题进行表决的时候，美国采取的所谓“中立”究竟是怎么一回事。又有消息报道说，北大西洋集团在即将举行的会议上将讨论印度尼西亚政府根据自己的主权对印度尼西亚国内的荷兰企业所采取的行动。从这里，我们不仅可以看出北大西洋集团的性质，而且也可以进一步认识到美国所主持的一切军事集团的性质。
    周总理最后说：反殖民主义和维护民族独立的斗争，是艰苦和曲折的斗争。但是，我们相信，不论甚么样的艰苦和曲折，都吓不倒印度尼西亚人民，相反的，却会使印度尼西亚人民锻炼得更加坚强。在这个正义的斗争中，中国人民永远是印度尼西亚人民的忠实朋友。
