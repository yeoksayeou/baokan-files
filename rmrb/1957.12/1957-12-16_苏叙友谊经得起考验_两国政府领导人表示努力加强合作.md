Xinhua News Agency, December 15th dispatch from Moscow: The Soviet government held a reception in the Kremlin on the 14th to welcome the Syrian Arab Republic government delegation headed by Deputy Prime Minister Azem.
    Attending from the Soviet side were Bulganin, Mikoyan, Kosygin, Pervukhin, and other government officials.
    Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting. He first pointed out that the visit of the Syrian Arab Republic government delegation to Moscow and the talks held here would help further strengthen the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and Syria.
    Bulganin said that the unshakable and solid friendship between the Soviet Union and Syria has been tested. In the difficult days of the Syrian people, when they faced the conspiracies of international imperialism and the threat of foreign intervention, the Soviet Union gave Syria firm support.
    Azem, the head of the Syrian government delegation, delivered a reply. He said, "We will never implement policies that violate our national interests. We will never allow others to turn our territory into military bases or unobstructed passages for imperialism. The friendship between Syria and the Soviet Union will be conducive to consolidating peace in our region."
    Azem concluded by saying, "We understand the letters the Soviet Union has sent to some countries, and we fully support the Soviet Union's proposals and suggestions regarding disarmament and ensuring the security of all countries."
Xinhua News Agency, December 14th dispatch from Moscow: Syrian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tarazi, held a reception on the 13th for the Syrian government delegation currently visiting the Soviet Union.
    Soviet leaders Bulganin, Mikoyan, Pervukhin, Shvernik, and others attended the reception.
    Soviet Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mikoyan, said in his speech at the meeting that when the aggression against Egypt failed last year, the old colonialist countries, Britain and France, suffered defeat, and when the plan to invade Syria failed, it should be said that the new colonialist, the United States, suffered defeat. The American ruling group created a theory of a Near East "vacuum" and tried its best to replace the old colonialist countries there, but the result was a complete failure.
    Mikoyan expressed his hope that a free Syria, dedicated to peace and peaceful cooperation with other countries and peoples, would become more consolidated and prosperous.

　　苏叙友谊经得起考验
    两国政府领导人表示努力加强合作
    据新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府14日在克里姆林宫举行招待会，欢迎以副总理阿泽姆为首的叙利亚共和国政府代表团。
    苏联方面出席作陪的有：布尔加宁、米高扬、柯西金、别尔乌辛以及其他政府负责人员。
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在会上致欢迎词。他首先指出，这次叙利亚共和国政府代表团的访问莫斯科和在这里举行的会谈将有助于进一步加强苏叙两国的友谊和合作。
    布尔加宁说，苏叙两国的不可动摇的、巩固的友谊是经过了考验的。在叙利亚人民困难的日子里，当他们面临国际帝国主义的阴谋和外国干涉的威胁的时候，苏联曾经给予叙利亚以坚决的支持。
    叙利亚政府代表团团长阿泽姆致答词。他说，我们永远也不会执行违背我国民族利益的政策。我们决不允许别人把我们的国土变成军事基地或帝国主义通行无阻的过道。叙苏两国的友谊将有利于巩固我们这一地区的和平。
    阿泽姆最后说，我们了解了苏联写给一些国家的信，我们完全支持苏联关于裁军和保障各国安全的主张和建议。
    据新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：叙利亚驻苏联大使塔拉齐13日为正在苏联访问的叙利亚政府代表团举行了招待会。
    苏联领导人布尔加宁、米高扬、别尔乌辛、什维尔尼克等出席了招待会。
    苏联部长会议副主席米高扬在会上讲话说，去年对埃及的侵略遭到破产的时候，老牌的殖民主义国家英国和法国遭到了失败，而在侵略叙利亚的计划破产的时候，遭到失败的应该说是新牌的美国殖民主义。美国统治集团制造出一种近东“真空”的理论，极力想在那里取代老牌的殖民主义国家，可是结果一败涂地。
    米高扬表示，希望致力于和平和同其他国家和人民和平合作的、自由的叙利亚更加巩固和繁荣。
