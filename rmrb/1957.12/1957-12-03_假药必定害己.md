Like itinerant quacks selling fake medicine, French Foreign Minister Pineau, on November 27th, during the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee discussion on the Algerian issue, vigorously touted the French government's proposed "Basic Law" as an effective solution to the Algerian problem.

The fundamental issue in Algeria is the issue of national independence, while the "Basic Law" stipulates that Algeria is an indivisible part of France, fundamentally denying the Algerian people's right to independence. The so-called "political reforms" stipulated in the "Basic Law" to be carried out in Algeria are merely a deception. This kind of "Basic Law" can only block the path to a peaceful resolution.

The French government's rush to get the National Assembly to pass this "Basic Law" at this time is aimed at dealing with the discussion at the United Nations General Assembly. In this regard, France has already reached a deal with the United States and Britain in advance, with the US and Britain promising to support France in the discussion. Therefore, as soon as the "Basic Law" was passed in the French National Assembly, British representative Noble immediately described this in the UN General Assembly's Political Committee as "progress" having been made on the Algerian issue, and portrayed resolving the Algerian issue as France's business, opposing the UN General Assembly's interference in France's colonial behavior.

If the Algerian issue were originally France's internal affair, French colonialists and their American and British accomplices would not need to be so flustered. In reality, as the head of the Syrian delegation, Zeineddine, said, the issue of Algerian independence is no longer just a matter of rights, but has become a matter of fact. Now, the Algerian people have actually controlled vast areas of Algeria. Their firm goal is Algerian national liberation. The Algerian National Liberation Front has declared that without guaranteeing the Algerian people in this regard, the Algerian people will not stop fighting. The deceptive fake medicine of "ceasefire-elections" cannot fool them.

For France, relying on the deceptive fake medicine of the "Basic Law" and the treacherous support of the US and Britain to overcome the crisis can never have good results. The war will continue, the financial straits will become more severe, the government's crisis will deepen, and the US and Britain will be able to further manipulate France. In the end, Algeria will still gain independence.

    假药必定害己
    像贩卖假药的江湖郎中一样，法国外交部长比诺11月27日在联合国大会政治委员会讨论阿尔及利亚问题时，竭力吹嘘法国政府拟订的“根本法”是解决阿尔及利亚问题的有效办法。
    阿尔及利亚的根本问题是民族独立问题，而“根本法”规定阿尔及利亚是法国的不可分割的一部分，就根本否定了阿尔及利亚人民有独立的权利，“根本法”所规定的要在阿尔及利亚进行一些所谓“政治改革”，也只是骗局而已。这种“根本法”只能堵塞和平解决的道路。
    法国政府在这个时候要求国民议会匆匆通过这个“根本法”，目的是为了应付联合国大会的讨论。在这方面，法国同美英两国事先已谈成一笔交易，美英答应在讨论中给法国以支持。所以，“根本法”刚刚在法国国民议会得到通过，英国代表诺布尔在联大政治委员会上马上就把这说成是阿尔及利亚问题已经“取得进展”，并把解决阿尔及利亚问题说成是法国的事，反对由联合国大会来干涉法国的殖民行为。
    如果阿尔及利亚问题本来就是法国的内部问题，法国殖民主义者以及他们的美英同道就用不着这样慌张了。实际上，正如叙利亚代表团团长宰尼丁所说，阿尔及利亚独立问题已经不仅是权利问题，而且已成为一个事实问题。现在，阿尔及利亚人民已经实际上控制了阿尔及利亚的广大地区。他们的坚定目标是阿尔及利亚民族解放。阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线已经声明，不在这方面给予阿尔及利亚人民以保证，阿尔及利亚人民就不会停止战斗。“停火—选举”这种骗人的假药，不可能使他们上当。
    对于法国来说，依靠“根本法”这种骗人的假药和美英的心怀叵测的支持来度过危机，绝不可能有什么良好的结果。战争将延续下去，财政的窘境将益趋严重，政府的危机会加深，美英将能进一步摆布法国。而到头来，阿尔及利亚仍然要获得独立的。
