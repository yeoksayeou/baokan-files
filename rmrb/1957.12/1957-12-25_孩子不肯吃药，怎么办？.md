    What to do if your child refuses to take medicine?
    Hu Ziru
    When a baby gets sick, the mother is very worried and hopes that he will recover quickly! But the baby refuses to take medicine. As soon as he sees his mother bringing the medicine, he cries and fusses, and no amount of coaxing works. What to do? The mother frowns.
    I am a nurse and the mother of three children, and I have experienced this situation many times, so I have some small experiences to share with mothers and aunts for reference.
    The children who refuse to take medicine mentioned here mainly refer to young children and infants under the age of four or five. It is impossible to reason with them completely; threats and coercion are also ineffective. Because as a result of forced feeding, most of the medicine that has just been taken will immediately be vomited out of the mouth of the crying and struggling child.
    Why doesn't the child want to take medicine? I think the reasons are roughly the following two: First, they usually hear from adults how bad the medicine tastes, or see the strange looks of others frowning and grimacing when taking medicine, or even be threatened with "If you don't listen, I'll give you an injection and medicine"; second, the child has taken bitter medicine himself. In this way, a fear of taking medicine is slowly formed in the young mind, and from then on, at the sight of medicine, he will have a conditioned reflex and avoid it.
    It can be seen that adults should first set an example by not complaining about the bitterness of the medicine in front of their children, and of course, they should not use injections and medicine as a means of intimidation. If you usually have time to play with your child, while teaching him various knowledge, you can also appropriately give him a correct understanding of getting sick and taking medicine through role-playing games or storytelling, etc., dispel his fears, and encourage him to bravely accept medical treatment such as taking medicine and injections.
    Unfortunately, if the child really gets sick (children get sick more often than adults), then try to find ways to reduce the bitter taste and unpleasantness of the medicine as much as possible. Here are a few specific methods that can be tried:
    1. For general medicinal powders and tablets, mix them with an equal or small amount of white sugar. Tablets can be crushed into small pieces or into powder. For very young children, the medicine can be dissolved in sugar water and fed.
    2. Oily medicines, such as cod liver oil and castor oil, can be dripped onto a small cup of fruit juice, a small spoonful of porridge, or a small piece of food (such as steamed bread, biscuits, etc.) and eaten together.
    3. Medicines with a particularly bitter taste, such as Aureomycin and Chloromycetin (both medicinal powders), their bitter taste can spread in the water, so even if they are dissolved in sugar water and drunk, they are still extremely bitter. This can only be done by wrapping the medicine in sugar: Put half a teaspoon of white sugar, bury the medicine in the middle (do not mix), pour it into the mouth, and quickly wash it down with boiling water or sugar water. In this way, the medicine is swallowed before it has a chance to release its bitter taste in the mouth. If the child is too young to swallow, you can do this: boil white sugar with water to make syrup, take half a teaspoon, then wrap the medicine in the middle, do not mix it, feed it to the child and then give him sugar water to drink.
    It should also be noted that do not mix medicine in front of the child, so as not to cause adverse stimulation. After the child has taken the medicine, it is best to immediately divert his attention with a strong temptation, so as to prevent him from still thinking about the bitter taste of the medicine and causing nausea and vomiting.

    孩子不肯吃药，怎么办？
    胡自如
    宝宝生了病，妈妈直着急，多么盼望他赶快健康起来啊！可是宝宝不肯吃药，一见妈妈拿药来喂，就又哭又闹，怎么哄也不行。怎么办呢？妈妈皱眉了。
    我是个护士，又是三个孩子的妈妈，多次经历过这种情形，因此也有了一些小小的经验，写出来给妈妈、阿姨们参考。
    这里所说的不肯吃药的孩子，主要是指四、五岁以下的幼儿和婴孩。对他们说道理，不能完全接受；威吓和强制也不行。因为强灌硬塞的结果，刚服下的药多半就会立刻从正在哭闹和挣扎着的孩子口中呕吐出来。
    孩子为什么不肯吃药呢？我想原因大致不外乎以下两个：一是日常从大人那里听到药如何难吃、或者看过别人服药时皱眉裂嘴的怪模样，甚至受到过“再不听话，给你打针吃药”的恐吓；二是孩子自己吃过苦药。这样，幼小的心灵就慢慢地形成了怕吃药的心理，以后一见药，就条件反射，远而避之。
    可见，大人们首先就该以身作则，不能在孩子面前吃药嫌苦，当然更不应该把打针吃药用作恐吓的手段。平日如果有时间同孩子玩，在给孩子讲各种知识的同时，也可以适当地通过扮演式的游戏或讲故事等方式，讲一些关于生病吃药的正确认识，解除他恐惧害怕的心理，鼓励他勇敢地接受吃药、打针的医疗。
    不幸孩子真的生了病（孩子得病机会比大人多得多），那末，就尽量想方设法减轻药的苦味和难吃程度吧。有这样几个具体办法可供试行：
    一、一般的药粉药片，可用等量或少量白糖拌在一起吃。药片可砸成几小粒或砸成粉。太小的孩子，可把药溶在糖水里喂。
    二、油类药物，如鱼肝油、泻油等，可滴在小杯果子水、小匙稀饭或小块食物（如馒头、饼干等）上一起吃。
    三、味道特别苦的药，如金霉素、合霉素（均药粉），它们的苦味能散发在水里，因此即使用糖水溶解来喝，仍然极苦。这只有采取糖包药的办法：盛半茶匙白糖，把药埋在当中（不要拌和），倒进口内，赶紧用开水或糖水冲下，这样，药还没有来得及在嘴里散发苦味就被吞下去了。如果孩子太小不会吞，可以这样：把白糖加水煮成糖浆，盛半茶匙，再把药裹在当中，也不要拌和，喂给孩子吃后再喝糖水。
    还要注意的是：不要当着孩子面调药，以免引起恶性刺激。等孩子吃完药，最好立即用强烈的诱惑力转移他的注意力，以免他还在想着药的苦味而引起恶心、呕吐。
