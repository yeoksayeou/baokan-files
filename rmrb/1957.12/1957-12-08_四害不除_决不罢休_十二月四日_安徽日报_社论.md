Rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes are animals that pose a serious threat to the people. Rats and sparrows constantly steal and waste large quantities of grain and damage crops. Field rats also often dig holes and build nests in field ridges, pond banks, and dikes, damaging farmland irrigation. Rats, flies, and mosquitoes are also carriers of many acute and highly infectious diseases, which can lead to the spread and prevalence of the most harmful diseases to the people. Therefore, in order to develop agricultural production and protect the people's health, it is necessary to resolutely eliminate the four pests.

Since the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) in 1956, our province has successively launched seven patriotic health campaigns centered on eliminating the four pests, eliminating a large number of rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes. A number of streets, villages, and a large number of "four-free granaries" with basically no four pests have emerged, greatly improving environmental hygiene and reducing the prevalence of diseases, to a certain extent changing the past bad customs and habits. Now that the new National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) has been promulgated, based on nearly two years of practical experience, we believe that the task of eliminating the four pests put forward in the Agricultural Development Program is not only completely correct and necessary, but also completely possible to complete or complete ahead of schedule as long as we are willing to work hard.

In order to gradually realize the task of eliminating the four pests stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program, the Provincial People's Committee has decided that the province should continue to launch a patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests this winter and next spring, based on the existing achievements in eliminating the four pests. This movement is now gradually being carried out in various places and has achieved initial results. We must win a complete victory in this movement.

In order to ensure the smooth and healthy development of the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests this winter and next spring, various localities should first put forward different requirements in a timely manner according to different times and different objects. Whether in rural or urban areas (the purpose of hitting sparrows is to protect crops, so it is limited to rural areas. Sparrows in cities and forest areas may not need to be eliminated – People's Daily Editor), from now until before New Year's Day, one month should be used to carry out a concentrated campaign, focusing on eliminating overwintering mosquitoes and flies, combined with eliminating rats and sparrows; around the Spring Festival, combined with the masses' habit of sweeping dust, another month-long concentrated campaign should be carried out, mainly to catch sparrows and exterminate rats, block rat holes, destroy sparrow nests, dig out fly pupae, and continue to eliminate hibernating mosquitoes and flies; after the spring thaw, in March and April, another one to two weeks of concentrated activities should be carried out to universally dig out pupae, kill residual and newly born mosquitoes and flies and larvae, and destroy sparrow eggs, catch young sparrows, and continue to eliminate rats. In all activities during the above periods, attention should be paid to combining dredging ditches, filling in pits and depressions, draining sewage, removing weeds, cleaning up garbage, mudding tree holes and eaves holes, strengthening the management of toilets, and improving environmental hygiene, so that the four pests do not have a breeding and栖息 place. And through these tasks, gradually form a good atmosphere of every family loving cleanliness and everyone paying attention to hygiene. Secondly, throughout the entire movement, we must always adhere to the work of mobilizing and organizing the masses, pay attention to using various propaganda forces, carry out propaganda and education in light of the ideological situation of the masses, help the masses understand the serious harm of the four pests and the great significance of eliminating the four pests, so that the movement reaches the degree of being known to every household, deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, every family mobilizing, and everyone taking action. We should also pay attention to imparting methods of eliminating the four pests to the masses, especially to give play to the wisdom of the masses, and timely summarize and popularize effective methods and experiences of eliminating the four pests that have been widely adopted by the masses, so as to make the elimination of the four pests achieve twice the result with half the effort. We should organize inspections and comparisons, and timely commend and reward advanced units and model figures emerging in the movement, and summarize and popularize their experience, and timely expose and criticize backward units that do not pay attention to the elimination of the four pests, so as to promote everyone to take action. In addition, local food companies and other relevant supply and marketing departments should cooperate with the work of eliminating the four pests, actively purchase sparrows and rat skins, and promptly supply the tools and medicines needed for eliminating the four pests; relevant health and scientific research institutions should also go deep into the masses, sum up experience, and guide the masses to carry out health and the work of eliminating the four pests.

This winter and next spring is the time when the first five-year plan ends and the second five-year plan begins. All aspects of work are very tense, especially in rural areas, where an unprecedented large-scale water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation movement is underway, and the task is even more arduous. Therefore, health and the work of eliminating the four pests must be closely centered on and combined with the current central work. All localities should make unified plans for the central work and health and the work of eliminating the four pests, and make proper arrangements for manpower and time, so that neither the central work is affected by health and the work of eliminating the four pests, nor the central work is only taken care of while squeezing out health and the work of eliminating the four pests, but the two are organically combined.

Paying attention to hygiene and eliminating the four pests is an arduous and long-term task of changing customs and habits, and requires a spirit of hard work and perseverance. However, some people now have right-leaning emotions towards the elimination of the four pests and lack vigor. This is a manifestation of insufficient understanding of the harm of the four pests and the importance of eliminating the four pests, and irresponsibility to national construction and the people's health. We must quickly and thoroughly overcome this right-leaning emotion, make up our minds, muster our strength, and carry out activities to eliminate the four pests with revolutionary enthusiasm, creating a higher tide of eliminating the four pests than in 1956. Some people also think that the work of eliminating the four pests and hygiene is "the same old thing," so they are not very active, which is also wrong. The problem is not "the same old thing," but whether the four pests have been eliminated. If the four pests are not eliminated, the disaster will not end, so we must come up with "the same old thing" until the four pests are exterminated. Hygiene needs to be emphasized every day, and everyone should pay attention to it. The four pests need to be eliminated every day. If they are not completely eliminated in one day, we will not give up.

The people of the whole province should act together and march towards the four pests!

### 四害不除　决不罢休——十二月四日“安徽日报”社论

　　四害不除　决不罢休
    ——十二月四日“安徽日报”社论
    老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子是对人民有严重危害的动物。鼠雀经常地大量地盗食粮食，糟踏农作物，野鼠还常常在田埂、塘埂、圩堤上打洞做窝，破坏农田水利，而鼠蝇蚊又是多种急性烈性传染病的传播者，可以使许多危害人民最厉害的疾病得以流行和蔓延。因此，为了发展农业生产，保障人民健康，必须坚决消灭四害。
    自1956年全国农业发展纲要（草案）公布以后，我省已经先后开展了七次以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，消灭了大量鼠雀蝇蚊，出现了一批基本无四害的街道、村庄和大批的“四无粮仓”，大大改善了环境卫生，减少了疾病流行，在一定程度上改变着过去不良的风俗习惯。现在新的全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）已经公布，根据过去近两年的实践经验，我们认为农业发展纲要所提出的除四害的任务不仅是完全正确和必要的，而且只要我们肯努力，完成或提前完成这个任务也是完全可能的。
    为了逐步实现农业发展纲要规定的除四害任务，省人民委员会已经决定全省在过去除四害已有成绩的基础上，继续在今冬明春开展一次以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动。现在这一运动正在各地逐步开展起来，并取得初步成绩。我们必须取得这个运动的彻底胜利。
    要使今冬明春以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动得以顺利健康的发展，各地应该首先根据不同时间和不同对象及时提出不同要求。不论农村、城市（打麻雀是为了保护庄稼，所以限于农村，在城市里和林区的麻雀可以不要消灭——人民日报编辑部），从现在起到元旦以前，应以一个月的时间开展一次突击活动，着重消灭过冬蚊、蝇，结合消灭鼠、雀；在春节前后，结合群众的扫尘习惯，再开展一个月的突击运动，主要是捕雀灭鼠，堵塞鼠洞，捣毁雀窠，挖掘蝇蛹，继续消灭蛰伏蚊蝇；春季化冻之后，3、4月间，再开展一至二周的突击活动，普遍挖蛹，扑杀残留和新生的蚊蝇及幼虫，并毁雀蛋，捉幼雀，继续消灭老鼠。在以上各个时期的各项活动中，都要注意结合疏通沟渠，填平坑洼，排除污水，铲除杂草，清理垃圾，泥实树洞和房檐孔洞，加强对厕所的管理，改善环境卫生，不使四害有一个孳生和栖息的场所。并通过这些工作，逐步形成家家爱干净、人人讲卫生的良好风尚。其次，在整个运动中要始终坚持发动和组织群众的工作，注意运用各种宣传力量，针对群众思想情况，进行宣传教育，帮助群众认识四害的严重危害性和除四害的重大意义，使运动达到家喻户晓，深入人心，家家动员，人人动手的程度。还应该注意向群众传授除四害的方法，特别要发挥群众智慧，及时总结和推广在群众中已经广为采用的有效的除四害的方法和经验，以使除四害收到事半功倍的成效。要组织检查评比，对于运动中涌现出来的先进单位和模范人物，要及时表扬、奖励，并总结和推广他们的经验，对不重视除四害的落后单位，要及时揭露、批评，以推动大家动手。此外，各地食品公司和其他有关供销部门要配合除四害工作，积极收购麻雀、鼠皮并及时供应除四害所需要的工具和药物；有关卫生和科学研究机构也应深入群众，总结经验，指导群众进行卫生和除四害工作。
    今冬明春正是第一个五年计划结束和第二个五年计划开始的时候，各方面的工作都很紧张，尤其是农村，正在开展一个空前规模的兴修水利和积肥运动，任务更是繁重。因此，卫生和除四害工作必须紧紧围绕并结合当前中心工作来进行。各地应该对中心工作和卫生、除四害工作统一加以筹划，对人力、时间进行妥善安排，既不要因卫生和除四害工作影响中心工作，也不要只顾中心工作而挤掉卫生和除四害工作，而是使两者有机地结合起来。
    讲卫生、除四害是一项艰巨的长期的移风易俗的工作，要有一股子干劲和坚持下去的精神。可是现在有些人对除四害怀有右倾情绪，劲头不足。这是对四害的害处和除四害的重要性认识不足，对国家建设、对人民健康不负责任的表现。我们一定要迅速地彻底地克服这种右倾情绪，下定决心，鼓足劲头，用革命热情开展除四害活动，造成一个比1956年更高涨的除四害热潮。还有些人认为除四害和卫生工作是“老一套”，因而积极性不高，这也是不对的。问题不在于“老一套”，而在于四害除了没有。四害不除，祸患未已，就必须来个“老一套”，直到四害被灭绝为止。卫生需要天天讲究，人人讲究，四害需要天天动手除，一天不除尽，一天不罢休。
    全省人民一起行动起来，向四害进军！
