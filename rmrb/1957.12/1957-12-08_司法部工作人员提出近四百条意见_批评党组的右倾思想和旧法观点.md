Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch: Ministry of Justice staff members, in the course of the great blooming and contending, sharply criticized certain right-leaning thoughts and old legal viewpoints manifested in the work of the Ministry of Justice Party Group.

From November 26th to December 5th, the Ministry of Justice posted 816 big-character posters. The Ministry of Justice Party Group also convened an enlarged meeting to solicit opinions from cadres on the work of the Party Group. Various units also held discussion meetings for universal blooming and contending. Currently, the staff of the Ministry of Justice have put forward 3,294 suggestions in big-character posters and discussion meetings, of which 393 are about opposing right-leaning thought and old legal viewpoints.

Regarding opposition to right-leaning thought, several big-character posters pointed out that the Ministry of Justice's 1957 work plan placed the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in a secondary position, which was a serious manifestation of right-leaning thought. Big-character posters also criticized a vice-minister for saying in his article "Correctly Handling Disputes and Cases Among the People" that the court's main task in the future was to handle contradictions among the people, neglecting the fundamental issue that the court is an instrument of the dictatorship, resulting in insufficient emphasis on the dictatorship. Some people also pointed out that some documents issued by the Ministry of Justice did not state that robbers and thieves were targets of the dictatorship, which was also a manifestation of right-leaning thought. Some cadres also criticized the Ministry of Justice for its right-leaning thought in the work of reviewing wrongly decided cases, "only paying attention to checking errors, not paying attention to checking omissions, only checking the left, not checking the right."

Some people pointed out that the reason why right-leaning thought in the work of the Ministry of Justice Party Group has existed for a long time is that mistakes in work are not openly criticized and not promptly checked. For example, when the Ministry of Justice implemented the Court Organization Law, it did not emphasize the task of dictatorship stipulated by the Court Organization Law, and mistakenly described all the systems stipulated by the Court Organization Law as "democratic systems," which affected some judicial cadres' vague understanding of the nature of the People's Court. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly criticized this right-leaning thought, but the Ministry of Justice Party Group only made corrections in an internal publication and did not conduct open criticism so that all cadres could jointly learn a lesson. One cadre pointed out that failure to conduct an open self-criticism on this matter is to oppose right-leaning thought with right-leaning thought, so right-leaning thought has existed for a long time. One big-character poster also pointed out that the right-leaning thought in the work of the Ministry of Justice has existed for a long time because it does not understand the situation below and does not understand the enemy's situation.

Many people pointed out that right-leaning thought and old legal viewpoints are closely related, and attention should also be paid to opposing old legal viewpoints when opposing right-leaning thought. Big-character posters criticized a manuscript written by Zhang Guoxiang for describing law as "norms of people's behavior," eliminating the class nature of law, which is an old legal viewpoint. The big-character poster emphasized that this manuscript was reviewed by the person in charge and suggested that the person in charge examine his old legal viewpoint. Another big-character poster said that after the central government raised the issue of intellectuals, some political and legal colleges and universities extensively recruited unreformed old legal personnel in society, with the result that old legal ideas are rampant everywhere in schools, which is very harmful to our training of cadres. This big-character poster also said that the Ministry of Justice knew that some political and legal colleges and universities were doing this, but it did not manage it well, and it hopes that the leadership will examine it.

The Ministry of Justice Party Group is conducting an in-depth examination of the opinions raised by the masses regarding opposition to right-leaning thought and old legal viewpoints. Some leading cadres who have been criticized have publicly expressed their acceptance of criticism to the masses.

### 司法部工作人员提出近四百条意见　批评党组的右倾思想和旧法观点

    司法部工作人员提出近四百条意见
　　批评党组的右倾思想和旧法观点
    新华社6日讯　司法部工作人员在大鸣大放中，尖锐地批评了司法部党组工作中表现出的某些右倾思想和旧法观点。
    从11月26日到12月5日止，司法部已贴出大字报八百一十六张。司法部党组同时召开扩大会，征求干部对党组工作的意见。各单位也开座谈会，普遍鸣放。现在司法部工作人员在大字报和座谈会上已提出三千二百九十四条意见，其中有三百九十三条是关于反对右倾思想和旧法观点的意见。
    在反对右倾思想方面，有几张大字报提出，司法部1957年工作计划中，把镇压反革命放在次要地位，这是右倾思想的严重表现。大字报还批评一位副部长在他写的
  “正确处理人民内部的纠纷和案件”一文中，说法院今后主要工作是处理人民内部矛盾，忽视了法院是专政工具这一根本问题，以至对专政强调不够。有些人还提出，在司法部发出的一些文件中，没有说明抢劫犯、盗窃犯是专政对象，也是右倾思想的表现。有些干部还批评了司法部在复查错案工作上
  “只注意查错，不注意查漏，只查左，不查右”的右倾思想。
    有人提出司法部党组工作上的右倾思想长期存在的原因是在工作上有了错误不公开批判和不及时检查。如司法部在贯彻法院组织法时，对法院组织法规定的专政任务强调不够，并且错误地把法院组织法规定的各项制度都说成“民主制度”，以至影响一些司法干部对人民法院的性质有了模糊的认识。中共中央及时批评了这种右倾思想，而司法部党组只是在一个内部刊物上作了修正，没有进行公开批判，使全体干部共同接受教训。有一干部提出，这件事不进行公开检讨，是以右倾思想反对右倾思想，所以右倾思想长期存在。有一张大字报还提出，司法部工作上的右倾思想存在已久，原因是不了解下情，不了解敌情。
    许多人提出，右倾思想和旧法观点有密切的关系，在反对右倾思想时也要注意反对旧法观点。大字报批评张国祥写的一篇稿件中，把法律说成是“人们行为的规范”，取消了法律的阶级性，这是旧法观点。这张大字报强调指出，这篇稿件是经过负责人审查的，建议这位负责人检查一下旧法观点。还有一张大字报说，在中央提出关于知识分子问题以后，有些政法院校在社会上大肆收容没有改造的旧法学人员，其结果是旧法思想在学校到处泛滥，这对我们培养干部有很大的危害。这张大字报还说，有些政法院校这样做，司法部是知道的，但并没有好好管起来，希望领导上检查一下。
    司法部党组对群众提出的关于反对右倾思想和旧法观点的意见，正在作深入检查。有些被批评的领导干部已公开向群众表示接受批评。
