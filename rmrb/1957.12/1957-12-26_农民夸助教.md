　　Farmers Praise Assistant Teacher
　　One early winter morning, two women members of the Longfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative, Zhang Yuanji and Jiang Renbi, were cutting pigweed on the hillside, praising the cooperative's new member - Wu Dongliang, an assistant teacher from Southwest Agricultural College. Zhang Yuanji said to her companion, "He does housework even better than my old Jiang." The old Jiang that Zhang Yuanji mentioned is her husband, Jiang Juelun, the deputy director of the Longfeng Agricultural Cooperative.
　　Wu Dongliang arrived in the countryside at the end of September and settled in Jiang Juelun's home. He has made rapid progress and is very popular with the farmers. Jiang Juelun is very busy with the work of the agricultural cooperative, and his wife has to work in the fields, so she has little time to take care of housework. After Wu Dongliang arrived, he got up every day at the crack of dawn to help the family light the fire and cook, cleaning the floor spotlessly. Then he went to work in the fields with Jiang Juelun. When he returned home, he carried water, washed dishes, and took care of the children. Once, Zhang Yuanji returned home late after collecting firewood. Wu Dongliang even ran up the mountain to meet her and helped her carry the firewood all the way home. Zhang Yuanji showed a kind and grateful smile when she talked about this. Wu Dongliang participated in agricultural production during the busy season of autumn plowing and sowing. He participated in the rush harvest of late rice during the day and attended the great debates at night. Wu Dongliang worked with Jiang Juelun, and when he did something wrong, Jiang Juelun helped him correct it. After each debate, Jiang Juelun always expressed his views on certain issues and studied them with Wu. Wu Dongliang also helped Jiang Juelun revise or copy some manuscripts.
　　When Wu Dongliang first arrived at Jiang's home, he felt strange and lonely. At first, he just worked silently in the fields, not talking to anyone. When he returned home, he couldn't find anything to do, so he stood alone at the door looking at the mountain scenery. He thought that he had come to work and train in response to the Party's call, so how could he continue like this? He was determined to put down his airs and humbly ask the farmers for advice. When he worked, he chose the dirtiest jobs, such as applying manure, and he also went to the street with the cooperative members to buy rice bran to feed the pigs. When there were no meetings at night, Wu Dongliang also ran to show slides to the farmers five miles away, acting as his own narrator. After a period of labor practice, the cooperative members said that Old Wu no longer had the airs of an intellectual when he walked and ate.
　　Lan Chunbi, the Party Secretary of Longfeng Township of the Chinese Communist Party, said that she once saw a farmer's back but could not tell who it was. She went around to the front and found that the farmer was Wu Dongliang.

### 农民夸助教

    农民夸助教
    一个初冬的早晨，龙凤农业生产合作社两个妇女社员张元吉和江仁碧在山坡上一边打猪草，一边夸奖社里的新社员——西南农学院助教吴栋梁。张元吉向她的同伴说：“他做家务事比我家老蒋还得行”。张元吉说的老蒋就是她的丈夫龙凤农业社副主任蒋爵伦。
    吴栋梁从9月底下乡，在蒋爵伦家落户，进步很快，很受农民欢迎。蒋爵伦担任农业社的工作很忙，他的爱人又要上地做活，料理家务的时间少。吴栋梁来了以后，每天天刚发白就起床，帮助这家人生火、做饭，把地打扫得干干净净，然后和蒋爵伦一起去田间劳动。回到家里，他就挑水、洗碗、带孩子。有一次，张元吉打柴很晚才回家，吴栋梁还跑到山上去接她，帮她把柴一直背到家里。张元吉一谈起这件事就流露出亲切、感激的笑容。吴栋梁下乡参加农业生产时，正是秋耕秋种繁忙的季节。他白天参加抢收晚稻，晚上参加大辩论。吴栋梁同蒋爵伦在一起干活，他做得不对时，蒋爵伦就帮助他纠正。每次开辩论会以后，蒋爵伦总要把自己对某些问题的看法谈出来同吴一起研究。吴栋梁也帮助将爵伦修改或誊写一些文稿。
    吴栋梁初到蒋家时，曾经感到陌生和寂寞。起初在田里做活只是闷着头干，跟谁也不讲话，回到家找不到事干，就一个人站在门口看山景。他想到自己是响应党的号召来劳动锻炼的，怎么能够就这样下去呢？他下定决心放下架子，虚心地向农民请教。他干活时就挑选上粪等过去认为最脏的活路干，又同社员们一起挑着箩筐上街去买喂猪的米糠。晚上不开会时，吴栋梁还跑到五里路以外去给农民放映幻灯，自己当解说员。经过一段时期的劳动实践，社员们都说老吴走路吃饭都没有知识分子的架子了。
    中共龙凤乡的党委书记蓝春碧谈到她曾看到一个农民的背影，但总也辨别不出是谁，直绕到前面去，才发现这个农民就是吴栋梁。
