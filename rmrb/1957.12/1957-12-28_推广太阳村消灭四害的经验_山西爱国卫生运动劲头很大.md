Promoting the Experience of Sun Village in Eliminating the Four Pests
Shanxi's Patriotic Health Campaign is Full of Vigor

(Our newspaper dispatch) Shanxi Province's winter patriotic health campaign, centered on eliminating the four pests, has been fully launched. Many areas have put forward slogans such as "Learn from Sun Village" and "Emulate Sun Village." Nineteen townships in ten counties, including Daren and Hequ, have also made guarantees that the four pests will be basically eliminated in two years at the earliest and five years at the latest. After comrades from the Hongduan Township Health Station in Hongzhao County visited Sun Village, they immediately made a plan and, on November 19, mobilized 769 laborers from the Xingxing and Xingliang agricultural cooperatives to engage in a movement to clear garbage and accumulate fertilizer. After renovating toilets, they dug up 1.2 million catties of latrine soil for fertilizer accumulation in three days, renovated 23 streets, and accumulated 2.22 million catties of fertilizer, enough to fertilize 669 mu of farmland. Jiaocheng, Fenyang, and other places have also successively organized people to visit Sun Village and cultivated several key areas. For example, the hygiene work in Dayinghong Township, Jiaocheng, is very well done. In order to have more Dayinghongs in the county, the county organized a county-wide grand tour on December 7, followed by a vigorous movement.

A feature of this movement is the strong support from Party and government leaders in various places. For example, the Jinan Special District organized a inspection team of more than 40 people to go deep into ten counties, including Linyi, to supervise and guide. As early as November, the Xin County Special District also convened a meeting in batches in Dingxiang, Hequ, and other regions, gathering the heads of the health sections and heads of epidemic prevention stations from all seventeen counties in the special district to deploy the winter patriotic health campaign. The county Party secretaries and county heads of some counties also personally broadcast to the entire county to promote the movement.

The vice-county head of Jishan County, an advanced area in health work, personally led 102 people to go deep into five market towns, thirteen townships, and 185 natural villages, combined with production inspections to conduct a comprehensive inspection of health work in various places, and selected four special model villages, 87 first-class model villages, and 78 second-class model villages. These advanced areas not only have good health work, but also outstanding production work, which has greatly encouraged and promoted the further development of the patriotic health and agricultural production movement in the county. Several villages, such as Taihao and Zhaidian, are approaching the level of Sun Village. The county will also hold a county-wide model evaluation and awarding conference at the end of December and plans to concentrate all medical personnel in the county to conduct a grand debate on whether the patriotic health movement can be carried out and whether it increases or hinders production, in order to unify thinking, clarify understanding, and lay the foundation for further in-depth development of the movement.

Another feature of this movement is the great determination of leaders and the great enthusiasm of the masses in various places. For example, Qixian not only held a meeting of more than 700 people, but also put forward specific plans, deciding to make the current health model village, Pusang Village, catch up with Sun Village within one year. The county plans to eliminate the four pests ahead of schedule in six years through one year of pilot projects, four years of concentrated effort, and one year of finishing touches. Currently, Tunliu County has created several "four-without" villages. Dong Ligao Village, which has basically eliminated sparrows, has also held a mobilization meeting. Now this village is preparing to hold a model conference to push the movement to a climax. The masses are very enthusiastic. In the winter cultural, educational, and health meeting in Anyi County alone, 56 townships, cooperatives, schools, institutions, and health stations put forward more than 30 challenges and responses. The masses used the following words to describe the development of the local health movement: "Production and health are being carried out on a large scale, Party, government, and cooperative cadres are setting an example, each person accumulates fifty dan of fertilizer, and hygiene sweeping accounts for half. Through this great movement, sparrows and mice will be eliminated completely."

### 推广太阳村消灭四害的经验  山西爱国卫生运动劲头很大

    推广太阳村消灭四害的经验
    山西爱国卫生运动劲头很大
    本报讯　山西省以除四害为中心的冬季爱国卫生运动已经全面展开，许多地区提出了“学习太阳村”，“向太阳村看齐”的口号。大仁、河曲等十个县的十九个乡还提出了保证，最快的在两年，最慢的在五年内要把四害基本消灭。洪赵县红段乡保健站的同志参观了太阳村后，立即作出了规划，并且在11月19日发动了星星、星亮两个农业社的七百六十九个劳动力投入了清扫积肥运动。经过整修厕所，在三天内就挖茅土积肥一百二十万斤，整修街道二十三条，积肥二百二十二万斤，可肥田六百六十九亩。交城、汾阳等地也先后组织人到太阳村参观，并且培养了几个重点。如交城大营洪乡的卫生工作就搞得很好，为了使全县出现更多的大营洪，该县在12月7日组织了全县性的大参观，接着就轰轰烈烈地开展了运动。
    这次运动的一个特点是得到各地党政领导的有力支持，例如，晋南专区组织了四十多人的检查队深入到临猗等十个县进行督促指导。忻县专区也早在11月份就分批在定襄、河曲等地区召集全专区十七个县的卫生科长和防疫站长开会，布置开展冬季爱国卫生运动。有的县的县委书记和县长还亲自向全县广播，以推动运动进行。
    卫生工作先进地区——稷山县的副县长亲自出马，带领一百零二人深入到五个集镇、十三个乡、一百八十五个自然村，结合检查生产对各地的卫生工作进行了全面检查，并且评出了特等模范村四个，甲等模范村八十七个，乙等模范村七十八个。这些先进地区不但卫生工作搞得好，而且生产工作也搞得很突出，对全县人民进一步开展爱国卫生和农业大生产运动起了很大的鼓舞和推动作用。有几个村如太郝、翟店等村都将接近太阳村的水平。该县在12月底还将召开全县的评模奖模大会，并且计划集中全县的医务人员，就以爱国卫生运动能否开展，是增加生产还是妨碍生产为题，进行一次大辩论，以统一思想，明确认识，为进一步深入地开展运动打下基础。
    这次运动的另一个特点是各地领导决心大，群众劲头足。如祁县不但召开了七百余人的会议，而且还提出了具体规划，决定要使现在的卫生模范村——蒲桑村在一年内赶上太阳村。全县打算通过一年试点、四年抓、一年扫尾等步骤，在六年内要提前把四害消灭光。目前，屯留县已经创造出好几个四无村，该县已基本消灭了麻雀的东李高村还召开了动员大会。现在这个村正准备召开模范大会，把运动推向高潮。群众劲头很大，仅安邑一县在冬季文教卫生会议中，就有五十六个乡、社、学校、机关和保健站，提出了挑战和应战书三十余份。群众用这样几句话来形容当地卫生运动开展情况：“生产卫生大开展，党政社干来示范，每人积肥五十担，卫生扫除顶一半，通过这次大运动，麻雀老鼠要消灭完。”
