Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 30th. The Romanian Grand National Assembly held a celebration meeting on the morning of December 29th to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Romanian People's Republic (December 30th).

    Romanian state leaders Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Groza, and Stojka, members of the Grand National Assembly, advanced producers, people from scientific and cultural circles, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Romania attended the celebration meeting.

    Stojka, Chairman of the Romanian Council of Ministers and member of the Political Bureau of the Workers' Party Central Committee, delivered a report at the meeting on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. He focused on the great achievements of the People's Republic over the past decade, and pointed out that these achievements were obtained by the workers and peasants under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party and the People's Government. Stojka said that the People's Republic is the most democratic form of state in Romanian history. Today, the socialist component in the Romanian national economy has already taken a dominant position.

    Stojka said that since 1948, the annual plans have all been completed. This year's total industrial output has increased to 4.2 times that of 1948. In the past ten years, the output of consumer goods industry and food industry has increased by 2.5 times and 2 times respectively, the output of chemical industry has increased by 6 times, and the output of machinery manufacturing industry has increased by 7 times. Stojka said that in agriculture, more than 1.3 million peasant households across the country have joined collective farms, agricultural production cooperatives and co-farming societies. In recent years, the total harvest of grain and the harvest of major crops have exceeded the pre-war level. However, the increase in agricultural production still lags behind the development of industry and the growing needs of residents. Stojka emphatically pointed out that the important tasks of the Party, the government and the entire people are: to strive to increase agricultural production, especially to increase the commodity agricultural production of socialist components in agriculture. In order to carry out the agricultural cooperation movement, political work should continue to be carried out among the peasants.

    Stojka then talked about the improvement of people's lives. He pointed out that due to the improvement of the wage system, the increase of subsidies for families with many children and pensions, and the abolition of the compulsory sales system of agricultural products, residents increased their income by 4.8 billion lei (Romanian currency) in 1957 alone. The state has built 2.5 million square meters of housing for the working people.

    When talking about foreign policy, Stojka said that if Romania only had diplomatic relations with 23 countries in 1947, it has now established diplomatic relations with 40 countries. We pursue a foreign policy of peace and peaceful coexistence with countries with different social systems. Friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union, China and other socialist countries has promoted the achievements of Romania's socialist construction in all aspects.

    Stojka also said that we hope that the Balkan countries will establish friendly relations. The possibility of establishing such a relationship exists.

    庆祝罗马尼亚人民共和国成立十周年
    罗马尼亚议会举行庆祝大会
    斯托伊卡报告国家十年来建设的成就
    据新华社布加勒斯特30日电  罗马尼亚大国民议会12月29日上午举行庆祝会，庆祝罗马尼亚人民共和国成立十周年（12月30日）。
    参加庆祝大会的有罗马尼亚国家领导人乔治乌—德治、格罗查、斯托伊卡，大国民议会议员们，先进生产者，科学文化界人士和各国驻罗马尼亚外交使节。
    罗马尼亚部长会议主席、工人党中央政治局委员斯托伊卡在大会上作了关于人民共和国成立十周年的报告。他着重谈到了人民共和国成立十年来的巨大成就，并且指出这些成就是工人、农民在罗马尼亚工人党和人民政府的领导下获得的。斯托伊卡说，人民共和国是罗马尼亚历史上最民主的一种国家形式。今天罗马尼亚国民经济中的社会主义成分已经占居优势。
    斯托伊卡说，从1948年以来，每年的年度计划都全部完成。今年的工业总产量增加到1948年的四点二倍。在过去十年中，消费品工业和食品工业的产量分别提高了两倍半和两倍，化学工业的产量提高了六倍，机器制造业的产量提高了七倍。斯托伊卡说，在农业方面，目前全国已经有一百三十多万户农民加入了集体农庄、农业生产合作社和共耕社。近几年来，全国谷物的总收获量和主要农作物的收获量都超过了战前水平。但是，农业生产的增加仍然落后于工业的发展和居民日益增长的需要。斯托伊卡着重指出，党、政府和全体人民的重要任务是：为提高农业生产、首先是为提高农业中社会主义成分的商品农业生产而斗争。为了开展农业合作化运动，还应当继续在农民中进行政治工作。
    斯托伊卡接着谈到人民生活改善的情况。他指出，由于改进工资制度、提高对多子女的家庭的补助和养老金，以及取消农产品义务交售制，仅在1957年，居民就增加了四十八亿列伊（罗币）的收入。国家为劳动人民建筑的住宅有二百五十万平方公尺。
    在谈到外交政策时，斯托伊卡说，如果说在1947年罗马尼亚只同二十三个国家有外交关系，那么，现在它已经同四十个国家建立有外交关系。我们奉行着和平和不同社会制度的国家和平共处的外交政策。同苏联、中国及其他社会主义国家的友好合作促进了罗马尼亚社会主义建设各方面的成就。
    斯托伊卡还说，我们希望巴尔干各国建立友好关系。建立这种关系的可能性是存在的。
