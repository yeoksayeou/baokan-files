    The Forestry Area Needs Medical Personnel

    I am a forest management worker, and I spend five or six months of the year in the sparsely populated, vast forests on the frontier of our motherland. Sometimes our work sites are hundreds of miles away from villages, and even farther from cities. Due to the different climatic conditions in the vast forests, illnesses occur frequently. Although we have a doctor in our forest management team, it is not enough to meet the needs. Therefore, I hope that the health department will allocate more medical personnel to the frontier forestry areas. This will not only solve our medical problems, but also allow medical personnel to undergo practical training.

    林区需要医务人员
    我是森林经理工作者，一年中有五、六个月的时间是在祖国的边疆，人烟稀少的大森林里生活。有时我们的工作地点距离村庄好几百里，距离城市那就更远了。由于大森林里的气候条件不同，经常发生疾病。在我们的森林经理大队里虽有了医生，但还不能满足需要。因此，我希望卫生部门多分配一些医务人员到边疆的林区来。这样不但可以解决我们的医疗问题，同时，也可以使医务人员经受实际锻炼。
