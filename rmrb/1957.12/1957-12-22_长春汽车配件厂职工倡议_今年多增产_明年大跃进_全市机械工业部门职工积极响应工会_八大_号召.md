    长春汽车配件厂职工倡议
    今年多增产  明年大跃进
    全市机械工业部门职工积极响应工会“八大”号召
    本报讯  长春汽车配件厂职工积极响应工会“八大”的号召，最近向全市机械工业部门的职工提出倡议：争取今年年底更好地完成生产计划，在明年做出更大的生产成绩。
    这个厂保证在提前一个月零三天完成今年国家计划的基础上，争取到今年年底再为国家增产九十万元的财富；1958年要给国家创造更多的财富，总产值要比1957年提高31％，产品出厂价格要比1957年降低30％以上；并且要积极试制新产品，完成1958年试制一百二十种新产品的任务，以便满足国家多方面的需要，并使本厂由生产单一车型配件，过渡到生产多种车型的配件。
    这一倡议得到全市二十多个机械工厂的热烈响应。长春度量衡厂的职工，保证完成今年生产计划，到年底再增产八万元财富；同时要制订好1958年的生产计划，在生产总值方面比今年提高5.8％，劳动生产率提高2.45％，并要试制六种新产品。
    长春市机械工业部门的职工为了促进明年生产的大跃进，正在紧张地、创造性地劳动着。长春汽车配件厂已经着手进行一百多种新产品的试制工作。老工人于景明在试制工作中认真贯彻多快好省的方针，钻研各种操作方法，大大缩短了试制期限，并节约了大量优质钢材。
