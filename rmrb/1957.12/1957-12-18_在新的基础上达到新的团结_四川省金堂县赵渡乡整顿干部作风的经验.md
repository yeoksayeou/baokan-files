Unleashing Thorough Expression, Saying Everything Clearly

After distinguishing the major rights and wrongs of the two roads, how to correctly handle the contradictions between cadres and the masses and usher in a new upsurge in production was the most concerning issue for the masses in Zhaodu Township, Jintang County, Sichuan Province. Although the vast majority of the township's 689 commune and team cadres were good and had achieved results in their work, many of them still had shortcomings and errors in their ideology, work style, and work methods. In the previous period of vigorous airing of views, the masses' opinions mainly focused on the two roads, with little mention of cadre work style issues. Therefore, when it turned to vigorous rectification and reform, rectifying cadre work style became the most pressing demand of the masses.

In view of this situation, the General Branch of the Communist Party of China in Zhaodu Township decided to continue to let go and mobilize the masses for vigorous airing of views in order to allow the masses to say everything clearly. However, this policy initially encountered a lot of resistance. Some cadres were afraid that the opinions of the masses would reduce their prestige, making it difficult to work in the future. Some felt wronged, thinking, "We eat our own food and wear our own clothes, but we are still being rectified," and adopted a negative attitude of coping. Cadres with serious shortcomings and errors were afraid of being punished and unable to step down. Although the masses supported vigorous airing of views, they were afraid that it would only be talk and no action, and that cadres would retaliate. A few ideologically backward people were afraid of being criticized as "typical examples."

In response to this situation, in addition to repeatedly explaining the principles and policies of the rectification movement inside and outside the Party, the Party General Branch also emphasized that debating major issues of right and wrong could not replace improving work, and that only by earnestly rectifying and reforming could the results of socialist education be consolidated. At the same time, the leadership repeatedly expressed its determination to the masses, guaranteeing no retaliation.

On the basis of raising the awareness of cadres and the masses, a vigorous airing of views centered on cadre work style began. Most of them started with criticism of cadres' daily minor work attitudes and democratic styles, and then gradually delved into the exposure of major problems such as cadres' selfishness, embezzlement, theft, and violations of laws and discipline. At this time, face-to-face forms such as general meetings, small meetings, and symposiums could no longer meet the needs of the masses. Therefore, various cooperatives adopted diverse forms such as door-to-door visits and individual conversations to allow the masses to say what they wanted to say but had not yet said. In such a vigorous atmosphere of democracy, a second upsurge of airing views was rapidly launched. Whether in the fields, on the roadside, or at home, people were comfortably talking about their innermost thoughts. In the township's 31 agricultural cooperatives, more than 2,400 households of members offered 2,836 non-repetitive opinions on cadre work style issues alone. The most frequent opinions from the masses were about cadres' undemocratic work styles and cadres' selfishness. These two types of opinions accounted for more than 75% of the total opinions. Opinions exposing cadres' embezzlement and theft accounted for 6.8%, and other opinions criticizing cadres for not caring about the difficulties of the masses and harming the interests of the masses accounted for 18.4%. These criticisms were like thousands of mirrors, not only helping cadres recognize their mistakes, but also helping cadres find the direction for correcting their shortcomings and errors.

Investigation and Research, Verifying the Facts

In order to seriously and solemnly handle the criticisms of the masses and ensure that every matter was explained and every case was settled, the rectification and reform groups established by each cooperative with the Supervisory Committee as the core and the participation of mass representatives played a great role under the leadership of the Party organization. In order to ensure that criticism did not harm the enthusiasm of cadres but could truly achieve the purpose of educating and improving cadres, after systematically sorting out and summarizing the opinions of the masses, they repeatedly identified, investigated, and verified each opinion, so that each criticism had facts, evidence, and was neither exaggerated nor minimized, but appropriate.

The identification results proved that after the training of the two-road struggle, the masses' political awareness had generally improved, and the correct and basically correct opinions accounted for 94.5%. A small number of incorrect opinions were mostly caused by hearsay and rumors. In order to distinguish right from wrong, clarify the truth, and distinguish responsibilities, the cooperative management committees and rectification and reform groups of various cooperatives universally convened meetings to identify opinions with the participation of the individuals concerned. At the meeting, those who were criticized were not only allowed to speak freely and debate, but also those few cadres who still did not admit their mistakes in the face of conclusive evidence were criticized. They were helped to further correct their attitudes and recognize their mistakes, so that they were convinced both in their hearts and in their words.

Zhu Juchang, the poor peasant director of the Supervisory Committee of Jialing Second Cooperative, originally stored 4,000 catties of oranges from the cooperative at his home in order to protect public property. However, when he sold oranges from his private plot, he was misunderstood by many people, and rumors spread that he was stealing and selling oranges from the cooperative. Some even openly called him a "thief." This difficult-to-defend unjust case dragged on for more than a year until this rectification, after multi-party verification, the truth was clarified, and the knot that had not been untied for a long time was untied.

For opinions suspected and misunderstood by the masses, after investigation and verification, the rectification and reform group gave explanations to the masses, eliminating the masses' doubts. Some were caused by the superiors' short time for arranging work, tight tasks, and not many specific methods explained, so the working group, on behalf of the superiors, assumed the responsibilities that should be borne. For problems belonging to the collective leadership of the cooperative management committee, the representatives of the cooperative management committee conducted inspections. For the personal opinions of cadres, all those that were correct and basically correct were educated to accept them humbly and conduct sincere self-examination.

Sincere Self-Criticism, Actively Going Down the Steps

Facts have proved that it is relatively easy to make cadres listen to the criticism of the masses, but it takes a lot of hard work to make them recognize their mistakes and publicly admit their mistakes to the masses. The most important thing here is to educate cadres to believe that the majority of the masses can distinguish right from wrong; shortcomings and errors cannot be covered up; only by actively and sincerely examining and correcting their own shortcomings and errors can they gain the understanding of the masses.

Huang Zhifu, a work recorder of Kangle Cooperative, selfishly altered work points and refused to admit his mistakes, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses. The production team had decided to deduct seven working days from him. This time, he took the initiative to make a profound self-criticism at the general meeting. Because he made a good self-criticism and was young, the masses not only forgave his mistakes, but also cancelled the original punishment.

In solving these problems, many cooperatives adopted flexible methods of differentiating and solving them separately according to the nature and scope of the problems. Problems that were of a cooperative-wide nature and common to the majority of the masses were reviewed at the meeting of cooperative members; problems that were partial and involved a small number of people were reviewed at the production team meeting or at a symposium of some people; individual or private opinions were resolved by apologizing at the door or through individual conversations.

Wu Tongsheng, a member of the Shili Lao Cooperative, was beaten by production team leader Guo Changhao last winter for being naughty and scolding people. Since then, the two had become enemies. This time, Guo Changhao personally apologized to him and reviewed his mistakes. Wu was deeply moved, and the two reconciled again.

After the cadres took the initiative to conduct self-criticism, many people automatically launched criticism of some erroneous remarks in the airing of views that slandered and abused cadres; heated debates were also launched on whether the cadres had achieved anything in their work and whether they needed to be led. Through debate, the advantages and disadvantages of cadres were comprehensively and correctly evaluated, and the achievements of cadres in their work were affirmed. The masses realized that cadres should not only be boldly criticized to help them correct the shortcomings and errors in their work, but also see their advantages and achievements, and warmly love, understand, and encourage them.

Guo Wanen, director of Zhonghe Second Cooperative, worked hard, missed many working days, and had difficulties in life. The members said, "Director Guo works for us, we can't let him go hungry." They automatically proposed to subsidize him with 40 more working days.

Improving Work, Consolidating Results

After the universal improvement of cadre awareness, they all regarded the criticisms of the masses as the driving force for improving their work style and work methods. Many problems that had not been solved for a long time were solved this time because the cadres relied on the masses. According to incomplete statistics, 2,049 of the 2,696 opinions put forward by the masses in the township have been corrected. This spirit of rectification and reform of correcting and doing things as they are said not only boosted the political enthusiasm of the masses, but also further strengthened the unity between cadres and the masses.

In the past, Zhonghe Second Cooperative's cadres had undemocratic work styles, made decisions on major issues without consulting the members, did not make financial accounts public, and overspent without the approval of the members, causing serious estrangement between cadres and the masses. For these problems, the members put forward 741 opinions in the airing of views, which were later studied and summarized into 85 items, and now 68 items have been resolved. The masses generally reflected, "If we rectify in this way, cadres and the masses will be of one mind, and even barren land can be turned into gold."

In order to consolidate the results of rectification and reform organizationally and institutionally, after full deliberation, the cooperatives universally and democratically elected new leading organs, ensuring the leading advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants. 90% of the original cooperative and team cadres were re-elected as cadres because they had seriously reviewed and resolutely corrected their mistakes and had regained the trust of the masses. All the cadres of Zhonghe Lao Cooperative expressed excitedly at the mass meeting that they would never disappoint the trust of the masses and would definitely run the cooperative well. Many cooperatives have also established new work methods and work systems that meet the requirements of the masses.

In rectifying cadre work style, because the principle of "unity – criticism – unity" has been consistently implemented, both cadres and the masses have received extremely profound education. Cadres are more concerned about the masses, and the masses are more caring for cadres. In this atmosphere of democracy and unity, many moving new phenomena have emerged. When Tang Jiayong, director of Zhonghe Lao Cooperative, discovered that the house of Wen Hongshun, a poor household, was dilapidated, he immediately helped him repair the house and helped him obtain a loan to develop hairy pigs. Under the leadership of cadres, a winter production upsurge was launched in the township, accumulating 4 million catties of fertilizer and preparing to immediately start construction on two ditches that can irrigate more than 5,000 mu of land in order to welcome a bumper harvest next year.

　　在新的基础上达到新的团结
    ——四川省金堂县赵渡乡整顿干部作风的经验
    纪希晨　郑青　张玉秋
    鸣深放透　把话说净
    分清两条道路的大是大非之后，如何正确处理干部和群众的矛盾，掀起新的生产高潮，是四川省金堂县赵渡乡群众最关心的问题。全乡六百八十九个社队干部虽然绝大多数是好的，工作有成绩的，但是，他们之中，有不少人在思想作风、工作方法等方面，还存在一些缺点和错误。前一时期大鸣大放群众意见主要集中在两条道路方面，对于干部作风问题也涉及得很少。因此，转入大整大改的时候，整顿干部作风成了群众最迫切的要求。鉴于这种情况，中共赵渡乡总支部为了让群众把话说净，决定继续放手发动群众，大鸣大放。但是这一方针，开初却遇到不少抵触。有的干部怕群众提了意见降低威信，今后工作不好做；有的感到委屈，“吃自己，穿自己，还要挨整”，抱着消极应付态度；缺点错误严重的干部则怕受处分，怕下不了台。群众虽然赞成大鸣大放，但怕只说不改；怕干部打击报复；个别思想落后的怕当“典型”批判。针对这个情况，党总支部除在党内外反复交代整风的方针政策，还着重说明辩论大是大非，不能代替改进工作，只有认真整改，才能巩固社会主义教育的成果。同时，领导上一再向群众表明决心，保证不打击不报复。在提高干部和群众认识基础上，开始了以干部作风为中心的大鸣大放。他们大多先从干部日常的较小的工作态度、民主作风批评起，进而逐步深入到干部自私自利、贪污盗窃、违法乱纪等重大问题的揭露。在这个时候，大会、小会、座谈会等面对面的形式，已经不能适应群众的要求。因此，各个社采取了登门拜访、个别谈话等多样形式，让群众说出想说但还没有说出的话。在这样一种蓬勃的民主空气里，迅速地掀起了第二个鸣放高潮。无论在田间、路边、屋头，人们都心情舒畅地叙说着自己的心头话。全乡三十一个农业社二千四百多户社员，仅对干部作风问题就提出了二千八百三十六条不重复的意见。群众意见最多的是干部作风不民主和干部的自私自利。两类意见占了意见总数的75％以上，揭露干部贪污盗窃的意见占6.8％，其他如批评干部不关心群众疾苦、损害群众利益的意见占18.4％。这些批评像千百面镜子，不仅帮助干部认识自己的错误，而且也使干部找到了改正缺点错误的努力方向。
    调查研究　核对事实
    为着认真严肃处理群众的批评，做到事事有交代，件件有着落，各社以监察委员会为核心，吸收群众代表参加成立的整改小组，在党组织领导下发挥了很大作用。为使批评既不伤害干部积极性，又能真正达到教育提高干部的目的，他们在系统整理、归纳群众意见之后，对每条意见都反复进行了鉴别、调查和核对，使每件批评都做到：有事实、有证据、不夸大、不缩小、恰如其分。鉴别结果证明：经过两条道路斗争的锻炼，群众政治觉悟普遍有了提高，所提意见中，正确和基本正确的意见占94.5％。少数不正确的，则多是由于道听途说，和以讹传讹的传闻所引起的。为着辨明是非，弄清真相，分清责任，各社的社管会和整改小组，普遍召开了有本人参加的鉴别意见的会议。在会上，不但允许被批评者畅所欲言，进行辩论；而且，对于少数在证据确凿面前仍不承认错误的干部，进行了批评。帮助他们进一步端正态度，认识错误，做到口服心服。嘉陵二社监察主任贫农朱居昌，原为保护公共财物，曾把社里四千斤广柑保存在自己家中，但当他出卖自留果树的广柑时，却被许多群众误会，传闻为偷卖社里的广柑，有的甚至公开喊他为“贼娃子”。这件难辩的冤案，拖了一年多，直到这次整改，经过多方对证，才弄清了真相，解开了长久没有解开的疙瘩。
    对于群众怀疑误解的意见，经过调查对证，由整改小组向群众作了解答，消除了群众的疑虑。有些由于上级布置工作时间短、任务紧、具体办法交代不多而引起的，则由工作组代表上级，承担起应负的责任。属于社管会集体领导方面的问题，由社管会的代表进行了检查。对于干部个人的意见，凡是正确和基本正确的，则教育他们虚心接受，诚恳检查。
    诚恳检讨　主动下楼
    事实证明：要使干部倾听群众的批评是比较容易的，但要使他们认识错误并公开向群众承认错误，却需做许多艰苦的工作。这里最重要的是：要教育干部，相信群众多数是会明辨是非的；缺点错误是包不住的，只有主动地诚恳地检查和改正自己的缺点错误，才能取得群众的谅解。康乐社记工员黄志富，自私自利涂改工分，不承认错误，引起群众很大不满，生产队曾决定给予他扣工七个劳动日的处分。这次，他主动地在大会上作了深刻的检讨，群众因为他检讨得好，年纪又小，不但原谅了他的错误，而且取消了原来的处分。
    在解决这些问题时，许多社按照问题的性质和范围的大小，采取了区别对待和分散解决的灵活方法。属于全社性和多数群众的共同问题，在社员大会上进行检讨；属于局部的、少数人的问题，在生产队会或部分人座谈会上进行检查；属于个别的或私人之间的意见，则用登门道歉、个别交谈解决。十里老社社员巫同生因为调皮骂人，去冬被生产队长郭昌浩打了一顿，从此两人变成了冤家对头，这次郭昌浩亲自向他道了歉，检讨了自己的错误，巫深受感动，两人又重新和好。
    干部主动检讨以后，对于鸣放中一些诬蔑漫骂干部的错误言论，许多群众自动地互相展开了批评；对于干部工作有无成绩，要不要领导，也展开了热烈的辩论。通过辩论，全面正确估价了干部的优缺点，肯定了干部工作中的成绩。使群众认识到：对于干部既要大胆批评，帮助他们改正工作中的缺点错误，同时又要看到他们的优点和成绩，热情的爱护、体谅、鼓舞他们。中和二社主任郭万恩刻苦工作，误工多，生活困难，社员说：“郭主任为我们工作，我们不能让他饿饭。”自动提出多补助他四十个劳动日。
    改进工作　巩固成果
    干部觉悟普遍提高以后，都把群众的批评当作改进工作作风和工作方法的动力。许多长期没有得到解决的问题，这次由于干部依靠了群众，都得到了解决。据不完全统计，全乡群众提出的二千六百九十六条意见，已有二千零四十九件得到了改正。这种随提随改、说到做到的整改精神，不仅鼓舞了群众的政治热情，而且进一步加强了干部和群众的团结。从前中和二社由于干部作风不民主，决定重大事情不和社员商量，财务账目不公开，不通过社员超额借支，致使干部和群众造成严重的隔阂。对于这些问题，鸣放中社员提出了七百四十一条意见，后来研究、归纳为八十五件，现在已经有六十八件得到了解决。群众普遍反映说：“照这样整改，干部群众就能一条心，那怕黄土不变金。”
    为了从组织上制度上巩固整改成果，经过充分酝酿，各社普遍民主选举了新的领导机构，保证了贫农、下中农的领导优势。90％的原有社队干部，由于他们认真检讨并坚决改正错误，都重新取得了群众的信任，当选为干部。中和老社全体干部兴奋激动地在群众大会上表示决不辜负群众委托，一定要把社办好。许多社还建立了适合群众要求的新的工作方法和工作制度。
    在整顿干部作风中，由于始终如一地贯彻了“团结——批评——团结”的原则，无论干部和群众都受到了极为深刻的教育。干部更加关心群众，群众更加爱护干部。在这种民主团结的气氛中，出现了许多动人的新气象。中和老社主任唐家永，当他发现贫困户温洪顺房子破烂的时候，立刻帮助他修补了房屋，同时帮他贷款发展了毛猪。在干部带动下，全乡掀起了冬季生产高潮，共积肥四百万斤，并准备立即动工，兴修能灌溉五千多亩的两条水沟，以迎接明年大丰收。
