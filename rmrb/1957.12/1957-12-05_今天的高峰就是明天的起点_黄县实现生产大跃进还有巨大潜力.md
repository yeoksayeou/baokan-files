Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 3rd: Do regions that have already met the agricultural development program's revised draft grain yield targets still have potential for increased production? Can production still leap forward? Leaders at all levels in Huang County and the people of the entire county, after a great debate on production, gave an affirmative answer to this question: today's peak is tomorrow's starting point. Recently, the Huang County Party Committee formulated an agricultural production plan that sets the goal of reaching 700 jin per mu unit area in the county in 1958, 800 jin in 1959 or 1960, and guaranteeing that Huang County will be transformed into a "1000-jin county" by 1962. Their slogan is: Our land is in the Yellow River basin, but our yields will match those south of the Yangtze River!

This production plan has a broad mass base. According to a recent understanding by the County Party Committee, the targets planned by each township have already exceeded the requirements of the county-level plan, but the targets proposed by each agricultural cooperative are even more aggressive than the township plans.

Huang County is one of the counties with the highest grain yield in Shandong Province. In recent years, the majority of farmers have had a relatively strong mindset that production has reached its peak. After a great debate on production recently, the farmers focused on seeing the tremendous superiority of collectivization reflected in production, and the many production miracles that have continuously emerged. Especially in this autumn's severe drought, the farmers of the county completed the sowing plan for 460,000 mu of wheat on land that was two to three feet deep in drought. Now, seeing the wheat seedlings growing fully and vigorously, even stronger than last year's wheat seedlings, they are unanimously convinced that collective farmers, under the leadership of the Party, have immense potential to achieve a great leap forward in production.

Jiang Songshan, Secretary of the Huang County Party Committee, said with full confidence: Through the water conservancy construction campaign this winter and next spring, more than 440,000 mu of farmland in the plains area of Huang County can be fully irrigated, and the degree of water conservancy in mountainous areas will also reach 64%. By 1960, all dry land in the county will be eliminated. At the same time, there is still untapped potential in raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer. In terms of production technology, there are also many successful experiences that need to be widely promoted. Therefore, as long as organizations at all levels strengthen their leadership, it is entirely certain that the county's planned production increase targets can be achieved.

### 今天的高峰就是明天的起点  黄县实现生产大跃进还有巨大潜力

　　今天的高峰就是明天的起点
    黄县实现生产大跃进还有巨大潜力
    据新华社济南3日电　已经提前达到农业发展纲要修正草案粮食产量指标的地区还有没有增产潜力？还能不能使生产跃进？黄县的各级领导和全县人民经过生产大辩论，对这个问题作了肯定的回答——今天的高峰就是明天的起点。最近，中共黄县县委制定的农业生产规划确定：1958年全县的单位面积产量要达到七百斤，1959年或1960年达到八百斤；到1962年保证把黄县变成千斤县。他们的口号是：土地在黄河流域，产量向长江以南看齐！
    这个生产规划有着广泛的群众基础。据中共县委最近了解，各乡规划的指标已经突破了县一级规划的要求，但各农业社提出的指标比乡的规划更为积极。
    黄县是山东省粮食产量最高的一个县，近年来广大农民有着比较浓厚的增产到顶的思想。最近经过生产大辩论后，农民们集中地看到了合作化表现在生产上的巨大优越性，和连续出现的许多增产奇迹。特别是在今秋的大旱中，全县农民在干旱二、三尺深的土地上完成了四十六万亩小麦播种计划，现在又看到麦苗长得又全又旺，比去年的麦苗还强，一致信服了集体农民在党的领导下实现生产大跃进有着巨大潜力。
    中共黄县县委书记姜松山满怀信心地说：黄县通过今冬明春的水利建设运动，平原地区的四十四万多亩耕地可以全部水利化，山区水利化的程度也将达到64％。到1960年，全县所有旱田将被全部消灭。同时，养猪积肥还有潜力没有挖掘；在生产技术方面，也有很多成功的经验有待于普遍推广。因此，只要各级组织加强领导，实现全县规划的增产指标是完全有把握的。
