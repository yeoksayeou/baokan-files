　　“Almost” and “Far From It”
　　Wang Pu
    Currently, a theory of "almost" has emerged in some factories and mines that have only recently begun rectification. Some leaders of enterprises, seeing that the number of mass opinions handled has reached 70%-80%, believe that the rectification is "almost" complete. This is not necessarily the case. Some enterprises that have undergone review have found that while the quantity is "almost" there, the quality is "far from it." For example, some issues that the masses are quite concerned about, but which the leadership considers to be "trivial," are overlooked; some problems that could have been solved immediately are labeled "under study" or "to be resolved later" and set aside; some units handle problems crudely and carelessly, leading to one mistake after another, and creating some farcical situations of irrelevant answers and illogical statements due to bureaucracy and subjectivism; an even more common phenomenon is that problems are solved piecemeal on a case-by-case basis, but the root causes of the shortcomings are not eliminated, and many major problems in the enterprise have not yet been addressed for research and resolution.
    In the initial stage of rectification, insufficient thoroughness in improvement is not surprising. What is worth being vigilant about is the "almost" theory. If enterprise leaders carry out rectification with such a view, they will end up cooking "half-cooked rice."
    It is not difficult to prevent "half-cooked rice"; as long as the enterprise leaders have the determination to "set fire to themselves" and thoroughly rectify, and tirelessly mobilize the masses to repeatedly conduct reviews.
    For the higher-level leading organs of enterprises, it is necessary to set up a "checkpoint" to prevent units that fail to rectify effectively from passing the test. The three standards proposed by the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, which stipulate that rectification must meet these standards before moving on to the great debate, is a good approach.

　　“差不多”和“差得多”
　　王朴
    目前，在部分开始整改不久的厂矿企业中出现了一种“差不多”论。有些企业的领导人员只看到处理群众意见的数字达到70％—80％，便认为整改得“差不多”了。其实未必。有些经过复查的企业就发现：在数量方面“差不多”了，在质量方面却“差得多”。例如，有些群众相当关心，但是领导人员认为是“鸡毛蒜皮”的问题被忽略了；有些本来可以马上解决的问题，被贴上“研究处理”、“以后解决”等标签搁在了一边；有的单位处理问题粗糙草率，以致错上加错，又闹出一些答非所问、文不对题等官僚主义、主观主义的笑话；更加普遍的现象是就事论事，零敲碎打地解决了一些问题，但是产生缺点的根源没有消除，企业中的许多重大问题还没有着手去研究解决。
    在整改初期，改进不够彻底本不足怪。值得警惕的是“差不多”论。如果企业的领导者抱着这样的观点进行整改，那就会煮成“夹生饭”。
    要防止“夹生饭”也不难；只要企业的领导人员有敢于“引火烧身”、彻底整改的决心，不厌其烦地发动群众反复进行复查。
    对于企业的上级领导机关来说，需要设立一道“关卡”，不让整改不力的单位蒙混过去。中共辽宁省委提出三项标准，规定整改达到这些标准才能转入大辩论，就是个好办法。
