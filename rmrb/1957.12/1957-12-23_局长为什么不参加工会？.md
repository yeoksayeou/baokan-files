    Why Doesn't the Bureau Chief Join the Trade Union?
    There are many problems with the trade union at the Wenzhou Forest Industry Bureau in Zhejiang. Regarding trade union activities, the trade union group meetings were only held three or four times in 1957. The trade union chairman is concurrently the chief of the storage and transportation section. He has never made a trade union work plan or written a work report. The deputy director (political deputy) in charge of trade union work has asked the trade union chairman several times to request the higher-level trade union to stop trade union activities.
    Looking at the organizational work, there are still 24 people (23% of the total) who meet the requirements to join the trade union but have not. Most of them are eager and actively apply to join the organization, but they cannot join because no one cares. A few are unwilling to join, especially leading cadres. For example, He Jianfeng, the director and Party group secretary of the Forest Industry Bureau, has not yet joined the trade union. Song Hong, the deputy director of the branch bureau, a member of the Party group, the Party general branch secretary, and in charge of trade union work, has also not joined.
    Regarding the payment of trade union dues, more than 90% of the members now do not pay dues. For example, Wang Yansheng, the deputy section chief of the Party member secretarial section (responsible for labor competitions), said to the person collecting dues: "Why should I pay dues for joining the trade union? What benefits has your trade union provided? It would be better to use this money to make a few clothes to wear." Therefore, the masses are discussing this: some say that if the bureau chief, section chiefs, and Party member cadres view the trade union this way, how can the trade union be successful? Some say: if our Forest Industry Bureau's trade union is like this, how can the increase production and practice economy movement be carried out? Some say: Party members and League members have organizational life to live, but we just wander the streets every day.
    I believe that in a unit, especially a production enterprise like ours, where Party members and League members account for 30%, and non-Party and non-League members account for 70%, relying on the trade union, a mass organization, to promote this movement has special significance at this time when we are launching the advanced producer movement. I hope that our Party member leaders will quickly correct their views on the trade union, effectively lead the trade union work, and actively play the role of the trade union organization.

### 局长为什么不参加工会？

    局长为什么不参加工会？
    浙江温州森林工业局工会存在着不少问题。就工会活动来说，1957年工会小组会只开过三、四次。工会主席由储运科长兼任，从来没有订工会工作计划，也没有写过工作报告。管工会工作的副局长（政治副职），曾几次要工会主席去向上级工会要求停止工会活动。
    就组织工作看，还有二十四人（占总人数的23％）是有条件可以加入工会而没有参加的。其中极大部分是要求迫切，积极申请参加组织的，只因无人关心而不能参加。有少数是不愿意参加的，特别是领导干部。如森工局局长、党组书记何剑峰同志至今未参加工会，分局副局长、党组组员、党总支书记并负责管工会工作的宋洪同志，也没有参加。
    就缴工会会费来看，现在90％以上的会员不缴会费。如党员秘书科副科长汪演生同志（负责劳动竞赛），对收会费的人说：“参加工会要缴什么会费呀，你们工会搞了哪些福利？这钱倒不如做几件衣服穿穿来得好。”因此群众议论纷纷：有的说局长、科长、党员干部这样看工会，工会还搞得好吗？有的说：我们森工局工会是这样，增产节约运动如何开展呢？ 有的说：党团员有组织生活可过，我们天天逛马路。
    我认为，一个单位，尤其是我们这样的生产企业单位，党团员占30％，还有70％是非党团群众，在目前开展先进生产者运动之际，依靠工会这个群众性的组织，去推动这个运动是有特殊意义的。我希望我们的党员领导同志迅速端正对工会的看法，切实把工会工作领导起来，积极发挥工会组织的作用。
