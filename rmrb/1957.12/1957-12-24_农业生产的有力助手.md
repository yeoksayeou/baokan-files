A Powerful Helper in Agricultural Production
By our reporter, Wen Ying

In the winter of 1951, eight poor carpenters in Shangzhuang District, Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, organized an agricultural tool production cooperative. Later, some blacksmiths and bamboo workers were added, and they signed agricultural tool supply contracts with agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams.

However, at that time, some cooperative members, in order to earn more wages, simply engaged in shoddy work. A large shovel should have been nailed with fifty-three iron nails, but one member only nailed forty. In addition, because he did not hammer the iron forcefully, the farmers found that after using it for a short time, several corners were missing, and the iron shovel separated from the wooden handle. A member named Yang Zhengshou, greedy for more and faster work, made the paddles for waterwheels uneven in thickness and length. Farmers shook their heads when they saw them, and no one wanted the products. Naturally, there was no money to buy raw materials, and the production was difficult to maintain. Life in the cooperative at that time was very hard. Three broken houses without doors and windows were used as workshops during the day and dormitories at night. One cooperative member described the situation in the cooperative at that time as: "The wind sweeps the floor, the moon lights the lamp, the bedding is too heavy to lift, and the pillow (wood) can kill a person." Cooperative member Xu Zhonghua said: "Working alone gets more wages and better food. Suffering in the cooperative is not as good as going home." In this way, members withdrew from the cooperative one by one, and it looked like the cooperative was about to collapse.

Just at this moment, the district supply and marketing cooperative sent Jin Juxiang to the cooperative to be the director. Before leaving, the district committee instructed: The cooperative can only be run well if it serves agricultural production.

As soon as Jin Juxiang entered the cooperative, he talked to the members. At that time, there were two members in the cooperative, one named Chen Dekuan and one named Tan Guiyi. These two people were determined to keep the cooperative running. They said: In the old society, you worked to death when you were busy and had nothing to do when you were idle. It was really "when the rape flowers are yellow, blacksmiths are kings; when the snowflakes fall, blacksmiths starve." How many craftsmen were not hungry sometimes and full sometimes? Now, with the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as the products produced are good and the plans are accurate, it is really "there is work to do every day, and every season is spring." Jin Juxiang and these members discussed and decided to first criticize the idea of shoddy work and only seeking immediate interests. One member made seven wooden shovels, which were crooked and unusable. Everyone held a meeting with him to calculate the losses: If the wooden shovels cannot be used, the agricultural cooperative will not want them, and the cooperative will waste labor and stockpile funds; if they are sold to the agricultural cooperative sloppily, they will break down in a few days, the agricultural cooperative will suffer losses, and they will no longer want agricultural tools made by the cooperative, and the agricultural tool cooperative will not be able to continue. As a result of everyone's calculations, they all felt that only if the products were good and the farmers welcomed them could the cooperative be run well. If they only cared about earning more money in the short term and did not care about the quality of the products, it would be like killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. Therefore, the slogan "Bad products do not leave the door" was put forward at the meeting, and the method of "guaranteed return and exchange" was stipulated. The problem of shoddy work began to be gradually eliminated.

However, it was not enough to simply overcome the problem of shoddy work. More importantly, it was necessary to understand what farmers really wanted, how much they wanted, and when they wanted it.

They thought of various ways to find out what the farmers needed. Sometimes, they took advantage of the opportunity of the district holding a meeting of agricultural cooperative member representatives to invite old farmers to the warehouse and workshop to appraise the products and ask the old farmers for advice. Sometimes, the members took agricultural tools to visit the farmers. To make a sickle, they went to the countryside four times to ask farmers for their opinions. After careful investigation and research, they figured out the needs of the agricultural cooperatives. How many punting poles and scoop shovels does a farm boat need in a year? How many paddles and cart chains does a waterwheel need in a normal year, and how many does it need in a drought or flood year? Agricultural cooperatives that grow more wheat and less rice need paddles and cart chains later; sickles are needed more in spring and less in autumn; nail rakes used by semi-laborers should be lighter, and those used by full-laborers should be heavier; after collectivization, not only in spring and summer but also in autumn and winter, agricultural tools need to be added. … After understanding this clearly, the agricultural tools produced were said to be easy to use by the farmers, and the cooperative's production also developed more and more.

They not only supplied new agricultural tools to the farmers but also went to the countryside to repair old agricultural tools for the farmers. According to calculations, this year alone, the members repaired a total of 506 boats, more than 400 waterwheels, and more than 3,000 pieces of large and small agricultural tools for the agricultural cooperatives, saving the agricultural cooperatives more than 3,400 yuan.

Now, the Shangzhuang District Agricultural Tool Production Cooperative is responsible for the supply of agricultural tools to four townships and seventy agricultural cooperatives. The cooperative's workshops, dormitories, and warehouses have been expanded to forty-two rooms, the lives of the members have been greatly improved, and the cooperative's public accumulation has increased to more than 26,000 yuan. Jin Juxiang and his companions have confirmed this conclusion from their own experience: Implementing the policy of serving agricultural production is the firm and unwavering direction of handicrafts cooperatives.

    农业生产的有力助手
    本报记者　文英
    1951年冬天，江苏盐城县尚庄区八个穷木匠组织了一个农具生产社，后来又增加了一些铁工和竹工，同农业生产社和互助组订立了农具供应合同。
    但是，当时有一些社员为了多拿工资，竟一味粗制滥造。打大锹本来应当钉五十三只铁钉，有个社员却只钉四十只，再加上没有用力锤铁，农民买回家用不了多久，就缺了好几个口，铁锹和木把子分了家。有个社员叫杨正寿，贪多图快，打出来的水车上用的柫板，不是薄厚不匀，就是长短不一，农民见了直摇头，产品没人要。自然就没有钱买原料，弄得生产很难维持下去。当时社里的生活很苦，三间没有门窗的破屋，白天当工场，晚上当宿舍。有个社员描写那时社里的情景是：“风扫地、月点灯、抬不动的地铺、砸死人的枕头（木头）”。社员胥中华说：“单干工资多、吃得好，在社里受苦不如回家好。”就这样一个个地退了社，眼看合作社就要垮台。
    就在这个当儿，区供销社把金巨祥派到了这个社，让他当主任。临走时区委指示：一定要为农业生产服务，才能把社办好。
    金巨祥一进合作社，就找社员们谈心。那时社里有两个社员，一个叫陈德宽、一个叫谭贵宜，这两个人决心要把社办下去。他们说：在旧社会是忙起来干死，闲起来没事。真叫做“菜花黄、铁匠师傅称霸王，雪花落地、铁匠师傅饿肚皮”。耍手艺的有哪个不是饥一顿、饱一顿。如今有共产党的领导，只要生产的东西好，计划做得准，真是“天天有活干，四季皆春天”。金巨祥和这些社员商量的结果，决定先批判那种粗制滥造只图眼前利益的思想。有个社员做了七把木锨，七歪八斜不合用，大家就开会和他算损失账：木锨不能用，农业社不要，社里浪费了劳动力又积压了资金；马马虎虎卖给农业社，用不了几天就坏了，农业社受了损失，以后就不再要社里做的农具了，农具合作社就没法办下去。大家算账的结果，都感到只有产品好，农民欢迎，合作社才能办好，要是只图眼前多拿钱，不顾产品好坏，就好比杀鸡取卵。于是就在会上提出“坏货不出门”的口号，规定了“包退包换”的办法，粗制滥造的毛病开始一步步地消除了。
    可是，仅仅克服粗制滥造的毛病还不够，更重要的是要了解农民到底要什么，要多少，什么时候要。
    他们想了多种多样的方法去摸农民需要的底。有时趁着区里开农业社社员代表大会的机会，邀请老农到仓库、工场来鉴定产品，向老农请教。有时社员们拿着农具去访问农民。打一张镰刀，就下乡四次去请农民提意见。经过细致的调查研究工作，他们把农业社的需要摸清楚了。一条农船一年要用几根篙子、几把戽锨；一辆水车在一般年景要用多少柫板、多少车链子，旱涝年景要用多少；种麦多、种稻少的合作社，柫板、车炼子要得晚些；镰刀春天要得多、秋天要得少；半劳动力用的钉钯要轻一些，全劳动力用的要重些；合作化后，不但春天、夏天要添农具，秋天、冬天也要添农具。……这样了解清楚后，生产出来的农具农民都说好用，社里的生产也越发展了。
    他们不仅给农民供应新农具，还下乡给农民修理旧农具。现在计算起来，今年一年，社员们一共给农业社修理了五百零六只船，四百多辆水车，三千多件大小农具，使农业社节省了三千四百多元。
    现在，尚庄区农具生产社担负着四个乡、七十个农业社的农具供应工作。社内的工场、宿舍、仓库，已扩大到四十二间，社员的生活有了很大的改善，社里的公共积累已增加到二万六千多元。金巨祥和他的同伴从亲身体验中证实了这个结论：贯彻为农业生产服务的方针，这是手工业合作社坚定不移的方向。
