Dear Comrades!

	Allow me, on behalf of the Central Council of Czechoslovak Trade Unions and the entire working people of Czechoslovakia, to extend our heartfelt, warm, and comradely greetings to the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, and to the heroic people of your beautiful and rich country.

	The working people of Czechoslovakia hold deep affection for the Chinese people, admire the heroism, revolutionary enthusiasm, humility, and love of labor of the Chinese people, and follow with great interest everything that happens in your great country.

	The People's Republic of China and the Czechoslovak Republic are reliable pillars of the socialist camp in the East and the West. Although the two countries are far apart, an unbreakable friendship based on common interests and common goals binds us together.

	We, the working people of our country, are infinitely pleased that the Chinese people, after freeing themselves from imperialist oppression, have achieved great successes through selfless labor under the wise leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and its faithful assistant, the Chinese Trade Unions. We watch with admiration the rapid development of the national economy, science, and culture of the People's Republic of China, and the improvement of your people's living standards. We admire and rejoice in your socialist construction, such as the Baotou industrial center, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the Changchun First Automobile Plant, and the magnificent Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, which for the first time in history connects southern and northern China; we are delighted with your road construction, especially the construction of roads in Tibet and other places. The working people of your country have demonstrated great initiative in the various socialist construction projects, and there is no doubt that your trade union activities have played a significant role in this regard. Dear Comrades, we sincerely congratulate you on your achievements!

	We in Czechoslovakia have already achieved very good results in the development of our national economy, which has made it possible to improve the living standards of our people.

	However, the needs of the people are constantly increasing. To meet these needs, it is necessary to further develop the national economy and socialist construction.

	It is natural that difficulties, shortcomings, and various problems will be encountered in the process of socialist construction. However, these are by no means shortcomings of the system, but rather shortcomings in the path of progress and rapid economic development. We mainly overcome these shortcomings through socialist education and by transforming people's outdated consciousness. We are carrying out these tasks under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and with the active participation of the trade unions. Currently, our people are discussing the proposals put forward by the Czechoslovak Communist Party on improving leadership and improving the system of managing the state and the national economy.

	Workers, farmers, intellectuals, and all working people in our country are putting forward opinions and suggestions on increasing production and labor productivity. Their suggestions are all aimed at completing socialist construction in our country as soon as possible. Our trade unions are also actively participating in this nationwide discussion.

	Our trade unions are using all their strength, through their political, educational, and organizational work, to actively help solve national economic problems, and are making full use of their extensive rights to thoroughly overcome shortcomings and bureaucratic remnants.

	We are attracting an increasingly broad range of working classes to actively participate in socialist construction, while paying special attention to combining construction tasks with concern for the people. In this regard, the rich experience accumulated by the Soviet trade unions under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party has given us very valuable help. This experience is a source of learning for us and a support for us to complete the tasks of socialist construction.

	Dear Comrades! The friendly ties between the trade unions of China and Czechoslovakia have a long tradition. For our common interests, we will further strengthen and expand the friendship and cooperation between our two peoples. No force can destroy our sincere friendship with each other. No force can destroy the cooperation and friendship between our people and the Soviet people, nor can it destroy our people's fraternal love for the Soviet people.

	We are willing to join you, in the spirit of the Fourth World Trade Union Congress, to extend our hands to cooperate with all trade union organizations in the world, to fight for the improvement of the economic and social status of the working people, to protect trade union rights and democratic freedoms, to fight for the prohibition of the production and use of weapons of mass destruction, to fight for disarmament, and to defend and consolidate world peace.

	Dear Comrades! On behalf of millions of working people in our country, we salute the glorious and great Chinese people, a bulwark of progress, socialism, and peace!

	We salute your country—the initiator of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence among nations. Our people fully support these five principles and, together with you, are tirelessly striving to realize them.

	The working people of Czechoslovakia fully support the struggle of the Chinese people and all progressive humanity to restore the legitimate rights and status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. We resolutely oppose the imperialist bloc, especially the US imperialism, and all their conspiracies to obstruct the restoration of the People's Republic of China's due position in the United Nations for the benefit of their own aggressive forces.

	We wish your congress success, and wish your trade unions and all the Chinese people new and great achievements in the cause of building socialism.

	Long live the unbreakable friendship between the working people of China and Czechoslovakia!

	Long live the international solidarity of the working people of the world!

	Long live world peace!

    捷克斯洛伐克工会中央理事会书记
    弗·卡哈致词亲爱的同志们！
    请允许我代表捷克斯洛伐克工会中央理事会和捷克斯洛伐克全体劳动人民，向中国工会第八次全国代表大会，向你们美丽富饶的国家的英雄人民致以衷心的、热烈的、同志的敬礼。
    捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民对中国人民怀着深切的情谊，对中国人民的英雄主义、革命热情、谦逊和热爱劳动的精神感到钦佩，并且以极大的兴趣注视着你们伟大的国家所发生的一切事情。
    中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国是社会主义阵营在东方和西方的可靠支柱，虽然两个国家相距很远，但是有着共同利益和共同目的的牢不可破的友谊把我们连结在一起。
    中国人民摆脱了帝国主义压迫以后，在光荣的中国共产党和它的忠实助手——中国工会的英明领导下，以忘我的劳动获得了伟大的成就，我国劳动人民对这点感到无限高兴。我们怀着赞扬的心情注视着中华人民共和国国民经济各个部门、科学和文化的飞跃发展和你们人民生活水平的提高。我们为你们的社会主义建设，像包头工业中心、鞍山钢铁公司、长春第一汽车厂，以及有史以来第一次把中国南方和北方连结成一起的巨大的武汉长江大桥的建设，感到钦佩和高兴；我们为你们的公路建设，特别是西藏等地公路的建设感到欢欣。你们国家的劳动人民在社会主义的各项建设中发挥了巨大的积极性，毫无疑义，你们的工会活动在这方面也起了重大的作用。亲爱的同志们，我们衷心地祝贺你们的成就！
    我们捷克斯洛伐克在发展国民经济的事业中已经取得了非常良好的成绩，这为提高人民的生活水平提供了可能。
    但是，人民的需要在不断地提高着。为了满足这些需要，要求进一步发展国民经济和社会主义建设。
    在社会主义建设过程中会遇到困难，产生缺点和各种问题，这是很自然的。但是，这绝不是制度上的缺点，而是前进道路上和经济迅速发展中的缺点。我们主要是用社会主义教育和改造人们的陈旧意识的方法来克服这些缺点。我们这些工作是在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下和在工会的积极参加下进行的。现在我国人民正在讨论捷克斯洛伐克共产党提出的关于改进领导和改进管理国家和国民经济制度的建议。
    我国工人、农民、知识分子和全体劳动人民正在提出关于提高生产和劳动生产率的意见和建议。他们的建议都是为了在我国尽快地完成社会主义建设。我国工会也正在积极参加这个全民性的大讨论。
    我国工会运用自己的全部力量，通过自己的政治、教育和组织工作，积极地帮助解决国民经济问题，充分利用自己的广泛权利来彻底克服缺点和官僚主义残余。
    我们吸引越来越广泛的劳动阶层积极参加社会主义建设，同时我们特别注意将建设任务同对人民的关怀结合起来。在这方面，苏联工会在苏联共产党的领导下所积累的丰富经验给了我们非常宝贵的帮助。这一经验是我们学习的源泉，是对我们完成社会主义建设任务的支援。
    亲爱的同志们！中捷两国工会的友好联系有着悠久的传统。为了我们的共同利益，我们将进一步加强和扩大我们两国人民的友谊与合作。没有任何力量能够破坏我们相互之间的真诚友谊。没有任何力量能够破坏我们的人民和苏联人民的合作与友谊、能够破坏我们的人民对苏联人民的兄弟般的爱戴。
    我们愿意同你们在一起，本着世界工会第四次代表大会的精神，伸出手来同世界上一切工会组织合作，为改善劳动人民的经济和社会地位、为保护工会权利和民主自由而斗争，为禁止生产和使用大规模毁灭性武器而斗争，为裁减军备、保卫和巩固世界和平而斗争。
    亲爱的同志们！我们代表我国数百万劳动群众向进步、社会主义及和平的巩固堡垒——光荣伟大的中国人民致敬！
    我们向你们国家——世界各国人民和平共处五项原则的倡议者——致敬。我国人民完全支持这五项原则，并且同你们一起为实现五项原则而不倦地奋斗。
    捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民完全支持中国人民和一切进步人类争取恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权力和地位的斗争。我们坚决反对帝国主义集团，首先是美帝国主义为了本国侵略势力的利益而阻碍中华人民共和国在联合国中恢复应有地位的一切阴谋。
    我们祝你们的代表大会成功，祝你们的工会和全体中国人民在建设社会主义的事业中取得新的巨大成就。
    中捷两国劳动人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    全世界劳动人民的国际团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
