Xinhua News Agency, Nanping, 28th. Liu Baitao, Chairman of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway Acceptance and Transfer Committee, announced at the signing ceremony for the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway acceptance and transfer on the 28th that the entire Yingtan-Xiamen Railway project has been constructed to a high standard and meets the design specifications, allowing for a one-time transfer for national use. The Ministry of Railways has decided to commence official operations from New Year's Day, 1958.

The signing ceremony for the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway acceptance and transfer was held at 9:00 a.m. on the 28th in Nanping City, Fujian Province. Liu Baitao reported on the acceptance of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway and provided an overall assessment of the project's quality. He then stated that the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway main line is 697.7 kilometers long. Adding the Lai (Zhou) Nan (Ping) branch line of 24.2 kilometers and the Zhangzhou branch line of 11.3 kilometers, the total length is 733.2 kilometers, making it a major transportation artery to the southeast coast of the motherland. The area along the line is densely forested and rich in mineral resources. The completion of this railway is of great significance economically and for national defense. The entire project was massive, but the officers and soldiers of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the staff of the construction, design, and infrastructure units displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm, overcame all the difficulties of "moving mountains and filling seas," and completed the track laying for the entire line (except for the Zhangzhou branch line) in just twenty-two months. The railway was handed over to the state for official operation within thirty-four months, setting a new record for the speed of new railway construction in our country. Moreover, the average cost per kilometer of the project was only 505,000 yuan, which is much lower than the cost of other newly built railways in mountainous areas. He expressed his highest respect on behalf of the State Acceptance and Transfer Committee to all the officers and soldiers of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and all the staff of the construction, design, and infrastructure units who participated in the construction of the railway.

After Liu Baitao's speech, all members of the State Acceptance and Transfer Committee signed the "General Report on the Acceptance and Transfer of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway." Representatives of both the transferring and receiving parties expressed their agreement with the State Acceptance Conclusion in their speeches.

    通向东南沿海的交通大动脉
    鹰厦路元旦正式通车
    据新华社南平28日电　鹰厦铁路验收交接委员会主任委员刘白涛28日在鹰厦铁路验收交接签字仪式上宣布：鹰潭—厦门铁路全线工程施工质量良好，达到设计标准，可以一次移交国家使用。铁道部决定从1958年元旦起，办理正式营业。
    鹰厦铁路验收交接签字仪式，28日上午九时在福建省南平市举行。刘白涛报告了关于鹰厦铁路的验收情况和对鹰厦铁路的工程质量总评。他接着说，鹰厦铁路干线全长六百九十七点七公里，加上莱（州）南（平）支线二十四点二公里、漳州支线十一点三公里，总长七百三十三点二公里，是通向祖国东南沿海的交通大动脉。沿线森林密布，矿藏很多。这条铁路的建成，在经济上和国防上都有重大意义。全线工程浩大，但是，这条铁路施工、设计和基建单位的全体官兵和职工发挥了高度劳动热情，克服了“移山填海”的一切困难，在短短的二十二个月就完成了全线铺轨通车（漳州支线除外），三十四个月内就交付国家正式运营，创造了我国新建铁路速度的最高记录。而且，全线平均每公里工程造价只有五十点五万元，比其他山区新建铁路工程造价低廉得多。他代表国家验收交接委员会向参加筑路的中国人民解放军铁道兵全体官兵和施工、设计、基建各单位的全体职工致崇高的敬意。
    刘白涛讲话以后，国家验收交接委员会全体委员分别在“鹰厦铁路验收交接总报告”书上签了字。交方和接方代表在讲话中一致表示同意国家验收结论。
