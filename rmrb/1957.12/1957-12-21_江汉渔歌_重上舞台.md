    "Jianghan Fisherman's Song" Returns to the Stage
    "Jianghan Fisherman's Song" is a Peking Opera with a patriotic spirit. It depicts a historical story of Cao Yanyue, the prefect of Hanyang in the Southern Song Dynasty, uniting with fishermen to resist the invasion of the Jin people. The old fisherman Ruan Fucheng and his daughter Ruan Chunhua are distinct characters and are two relatively successfully portrayed figures. Some touching and inspiring plots interspersed in the middle once moved thousands of audiences.
    This play was written by Tian Han in 1937, and its performance was persecuted by the Kuomintang at that time. After it was staged in Beijing in 1950, it was suspended for a period of time because the characters in the play were somewhat inconsistent with the historical facts. Recently, the Second Troupe of the China Peking Opera Theatre has reorganized and restaged it, and it has met the audience with a new look. (Feng)

    “江汉渔歌”重上舞台
    “江汉渔歌”是一出具有爱国主义精神的京剧。它描叙了南宋汉阳太守曹彦约联合渔民协力抗御金人侵略的一段历史故事。剧中的老渔民阮复成和他的女儿阮春花形象鲜明，是刻划得比较成功的两个人物，中间穿插的一些可歌可泣的情节，曾经感动过成千的观众。
    这出戏是田汉在1937年写的，当时演出还受到国民党的迫害。1950年在北京上演后，因考虑到剧中人物和历史的真实情况有些出入，就停演了一个时期。最近，中国京剧院二团加以整理重排，以新的面目和观众见了面。（枫）
