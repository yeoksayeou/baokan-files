Can Advanced Producers Be Cancelled?

In the big-character posters for the rectification campaign at the Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory, there were some debates about advanced producers. Here is part of it:

　　Cancel all advanced producers!
　　Zhang Shou Zeng

　　I suggest to the leadership that all the advanced producers in our factory from the third quarter onwards be cancelled. Why do I say this? In my opinion, the few advanced producers have no effect at all and cannot lead by example at all; we still rely on the comrades' own initiative. Why do I say this? The working class leadership has improved its awareness and become the masters of the house. It's ridiculous to say that relying on a few advanced comrades can get the work done well. You say learn from them, but what are you learning? Are you learning technology or culture from them? You say that the advanced can lead the backward, but how can they lead the backward? You also say that the advanced can help the backward to improve production, but which backward comrade has been led well by the advanced producers in our entire factory and in each workshop?

　　Please think about it, leaders, is it reasonable to cancel them? It's unreasonable to divide the blood and sweat of the majority of working people among a few advanced comrades for them to enjoy, and in the end, they get to act like they're doing us a favor. In my opinion, it would be most appropriate to put the money for these advanced producers into bonuses, so that everyone can enjoy it. This would improve production and increase work efficiency! …

　　Only with the advanced can we lead the backward
　　Bai Zong Qin

　　I was very angry and indignant after reading your big-character poster. You say that advanced producers have no effect. Let me ask you: How much of a role did the dust extraction device created by Comrade Hu Sibei play in the health of all our employees! Are you saying that this was the result of backwardness? You also say that advanced producers cannot lead the backward. Let me ask you, since 1953, the number of advanced producers in our factory has increased several times. Are you saying that this was not led by advanced producers? Was this also led by backwardness? [The big-character posters of Tang Cheng and Zhang Huilan said: "Comrade Liu Tiecheng of our factory used his brains to come up with a solution. Originally, glass tube strips had to be cut with raw materials. After his improvement, strips cut from mouth material could be used. Because of Liu Tiecheng's improvement, this method was promoted to all work sections, and all work sections produced according to this advanced method. This is the advanced leading everyone and accumulating wealth for the country. Isn't this the achievement of the advanced?"]

　　You also say that it is unreasonable to divide the blood and sweat of the working people among a few people for them to enjoy, and it would be more reasonable to put it into bonuses for everyone to enjoy. I think what you said is purely fallacious. Why should the rewards earned by advanced producers for their labor [Editor's note: The rewards referred to here may be part of the bonuses received by advanced producers for inventions, creations, or over fulfilling production, but the value created by advanced producers is actually much greater than this part of the bonus.] be enjoyed by everyone? It is truly reasonable for whoever labors to enjoy the fruits of their labor. Moreover, advanced producers are not designated by any leader; they create advanced conditions with their own wisdom and hard work and are publicly recognized by everyone. They have made great contributions to the people, and the people must give them a certain price. Let me ask you, why is this unreasonable? What thoughts and intentions are you harboring when you say this?

### 先进生产者能取消吗？

　　先进生产者能取消吗？
    在北京光华木材厂整风的大字报中，有一些关于先进生产者的辩论。这里是其中的一部分：
    一律取消先进生产者！
  　张寿增
    建议领导，把咱们厂的先进生产者自第三季度与今后的一律取消。为什么这样说呢？依我说，最少数的先进生产者人物一点作用不起，根本就带动不起来，还是依靠同志们自觉。为什么这样说？工人阶级领导觉悟提高，当家作主啦，依靠少数的同志先进就能把工作搞好了，我说这真有点好笑。你说向他们学习，可又学习什么呢？是向他们学技术还是学文化？你说他先进带动落后，又怎样能带动落后？你又说先进能帮助落后搞好生产，可是咱们全厂及各个车间的先进生产者人物又把那一位落后的同志带动好了呢？
    请领导想想看，是否取消合理？只把多数劳动人民同志血汗分给少数先进同志来享受，我看这不合理，临完还让他们便宜卖乖。依我看，可以把这先进生产者的钱，放入奖金里最适当，让大家来享受，这样倒能搞好生产提高工作效率！……
    有先进才能带动落后
  　白宗勤
    我看了你的大字报非常气忿不平，你说先进生产者不起作用，我问你一下：胡四辈同志创造的抽尘器对我们全体职工的身体健康起了多大的作用！难道说，这是落后起的作用吗？你又说，先进生产者带动不了落后，我问你，从1953年到现在，我厂先进生产者增加了好几倍，难道说这不是先进生产者带动起来的？这也是落后带动起来的吗？〔唐澄、张惠兰的大字报说：“我厂刘铁成同志由于开动脑筋想办法，原来玻璃管条要用原材配锯，经过他改进后，只要在口料上裁下来的条就可以用了。由于刘铁成的改进，把这个办法推广到各工段，各工段都照这先进的办法来生产。这就是先进带动大家，给国家积累了财富，这难道不是先进者的成绩吗？”〕
    你还说，只把劳动人民同志血汗分给少数人享受不合理，应当放到奖金里让大家享受才合理。我认为你说的话，纯粹是谬论，先进生产者劳动所得到的报酬〔编者按：这里所指的报酬，可能是先进生产者由于发明创造或者超额完成生产所得到的一部分奖金，先进生产者所创造的价值，实际比这部分奖金大的多。〕为什么应当让大家来享受呢？谁劳动出来谁享受这才真正合理。再说先进生产者并不是那位领导指定的，他是以自己的智慧和辛勤劳动创造先进条件、由大家来公认的。他给人民创造了大量贡献，人民就要给他一定的代价。我问你，为什么这不合理呢？你抱着什么思想、企图、这样说呢？
