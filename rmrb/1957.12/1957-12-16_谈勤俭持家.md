　　Talking about Diligent and Frugal Housekeeping
　　Zhi Fei

　　While building the nation through diligence and frugality, we should also practice diligent and frugal housekeeping. The reason is simple: the family is a unit of society, and the individual is a member of the family. If someone in our society today lives poorly, or if a family is not managed properly, it adds trouble to the government. This is because today's people's government is fully responsible for every family, and of course, every individual.

　　It's not just that poor household management causes trouble for the government; more importantly, our socialist construction is underway. To transform the poverty and backwardness left over from old China into a prosperous and strong new society requires saving and accumulating wealth. This is not a simple task that can be accomplished overnight, meaning it requires a considerable amount of time and a difficult process. Every one of us has this responsibility.

　　While building the nation through diligence and frugality is the task of the entire people, diligent and frugal housekeeping has special significance for women comrades. Simply put, it's domestic labor, which is one of our excellent Chinese traditions. In terms of diligence, laboring families since ancient times have been characterized by "men plowing and women weaving." The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl in novels and dramas are the most common symbol. In addition to labor, household affairs must also be handled well. Today, domestic labor has even greater social significance because it is the grassroots work of building the nation through diligence and frugality.

　　There's no need to shy away from the fact that some women, especially intellectuals, have always looked down on physical labor, especially domestic labor, considering it trivial and unworthy of their attention. Some even consider it base and lacking in ambition, dismissing household management as something for "busybody" women. This is obviously incorrect thinking. Truly working-class families value "oil, salt, firewood, rice, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea." These seven things are indispensable to life.

　　Diligent and frugal housekeeping does not mean not eating or wearing clothes. Its spirit is to oppose waste and to live within one's means, with the goal of arranging family life well. We resolutely oppose the "rich for three days, poor for half a month" kind of unplanned lifestyle. As the saying goes, "Eating won't make you poor, dressing won't make you poor, it's poor planning that makes you poor." This is indeed based on experience. In family life, the most important thing is to have a plan. We see that many model examples of diligent and frugal housekeeping start with careful calculation.

　　If every family can be diligent and frugal, they will not only save on expenses for electricity, coal, grain, and cloth, but also increase the supply of industrial raw materials for the country. This directly affects the cause of building socialism. The ancients said, "The people's livelihood lies in diligence; diligence leads to abundance." "Abundance" means not lacking. Only through diligence can there be harvests. It is also said: "Frugality is sufficient for use," and "Frugality does not deprive others." "Sufficient for use" means not being insufficient; "does not deprive others" means not wanting to exploit others. Only through frugality can there be a steady flow. These words still have meaning today, especially the "does not deprive others" aspect, which is deeply meaningful. It affirms that one must first be diligent and frugal to be able to eliminate exploitative thoughts. The opposite of this is extravagance, which is having unlimited desires. Naturally, this will lead to exploitative thoughts.

　　Why do we hope that every woman can practice diligent and frugal housekeeping? Because it not only makes family life happier but also contributes to building the nation through diligence and frugality. This is a great and glorious historical task.

　　谈勤俭持家
　　知非
    勤俭建国，同时应该勤俭持家。理由很简单：家庭是社会的组成单位，个人是家庭的成员，我们今天的社会，某一个人生活得不好，某一个家庭处理得不妥当，都是给政府添麻烦。因为今天的人民政府对于每一家，当然包括每一个人，是完全负责的。
    家庭生活处理不好，给政府添麻烦，还不算；更重要的：咱们的社会主义的建设事业，正在开展，要把旧中国遗留下来的贫困落后状态，改变成为繁荣富强的新社会，就需要省吃俭用，积累资财，并不是一蹴而就的简单事情，也就是说还需要一段相当时间和艰苦过程，我们每一个人都有这个责任。
    勤俭建国既是全国人民的任务，勤俭持家，对女同志来说更有特殊意义。简单地说，就是家务劳动，这正是我们中国优良传统之一。从勤劳方面说，自古以来的劳动家庭，必然是“男耕女织”，小说戏剧中的牛郎织女，便是最普通的象征。除了劳动之外，还要把家庭事务处理好。在今天家务劳动就更具有社会意义，因为它是勤俭建国的基层工作。
    不必讳言，也有少数妇女，特别是妇女中的知识分子，一向轻视体力劳动，尤其看不起家务劳动，认为是家庭琐事，不屑去作，更有认为是下贱的，是没有出息的，把操持家务说成是婆婆妈妈的事，这显然是不正确的思想。真正劳动人民的家庭，莫不重视“油盐柴米酱醋茶”，开门七件事，是生活中必不可少的东西。
    勤俭持家，并不是不吃饭不穿衣，它的精神是反对浪费，是量入为出，其目的是把家庭生活安排好。我们坚决反对有些人所过的“富三天、穷半月”那种漫无计划的生活，俗话说：“吃不穷，穿不穷，计算不到就得穷”，这确是经验之谈。在家庭生活中，最主要的是要有计划，我们看许多勤俭持家的模范事例，她们都是从精打细算入手。
    每一个家庭若能勤俭，她们不止节省了用电、用煤、用粮、用布的开支，并且还为国家增加了工业原料，这便直接影响到建设社会主义的事业。古人说：“民生在勤，勤则不匮”，不匮是不缺乏，只有勤劳才有收获。又说：“俭以足用”、“俭则不夺人”，足用是不至于不够；不夺人是不想剥削人。只有俭省才能够细水长流。这些话在今天还有它的意义，尤其是“不夺人”的意味深长，它肯定必须先能勤俭，才有可能去掉剥削思想，它的反面是奢侈，是怀着无限度的欲望，这样，很自然地会产生剥削思想。
    我们为什么希望每一个妇女都能勤俭持家？因为它不只是使家庭生活过得更幸福，同时还有助于勤俭建国，这是伟大光荣的历史任务。
