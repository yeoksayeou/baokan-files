In the Schools

    The Peking Agricultural University Drama Club, with the care and support of all parties, has achieved certain results, and has successively performed dramas such as "Night in the Borderland," "The Competition Between Seedlings," "The Manager and the Swindler," "The Grapes are Rotten," "Put Down Your Whip," "Such Love," and "Growing Up in Struggle." The drama club also held a Lu Xun memorial meeting, a poetry recital, and invited actors from the Children's Theater to perform at the school, which was well received by the students.
    Recently, in order to cooperate with socialist ideological education, they have selected "An Odd Fellow" and "Promotion" for rehearsal.
    In terms of recitation, they are rehearsing Pushkin's fairy tale poem drama "The Fisherman and the Goldfish." Shandong Kuaishu and crosstalk performances are also in preparation. (Zhu Baiqing)
