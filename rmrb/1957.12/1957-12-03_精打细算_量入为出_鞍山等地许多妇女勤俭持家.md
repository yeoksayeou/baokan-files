Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 2nd: Many women in the cities of Anshan, Fushun, Lushun-Dalian, and Yingkou have achieved considerable success in managing their households thriftily.

Currently, many families in these regions have established household income and expenditure plans based on the principle of "living within means and careful calculation." Many women have devised specific methods for saving grain, coal, water, and electricity. At the same time, they deposit the money saved in banks. According to statistics from Yingkou City for the first half of the year alone, total savings reached 1,229,000 yuan, an increase of more than 50% compared to the same period last year. Li Guiqing, a staff member's family member from Dongzhan Street in the city, has a family of five. Her husband's monthly salary is 57 yuan. Thanks to her careful calculations, not only does the whole family live well, but she can also save six jin of grain each month and has twelve yuan in regular savings. According to statistics from Anshan City, women in the city saved more than 150,000 jin of grain in July and August alone, and women in the city have saved more than 14,000 tons of coal in the past six months. In Fushun City, two residential groups on Jianshe Street, after modifying their stoves, can save an average of 2,850 jin of coal per month.

Women in the four cities of Anshan, Yingkou, and others have also actively participated in diversified sideline production such as raising chickens, pigs, and growing vegetables, increasing household income. In Yingkou City, more than 3,000 households are engaged in sideline production such as weaving mats and pasting boxes, with an average monthly income of about 20 yuan per household.

    精打细算　量入为出
　　鞍山等地许多妇女勤俭持家
    新华社沈阳2日电　鞍山、抚顺、旅大和营口四个市的许多妇女勤俭持家获得了不少成绩。
    目前，这些地区的许多家庭都订立了“量入为出，精打细算”的家庭收支计划，许多妇女创造了节约粮、煤、水、电的具体办法，同时把节省下来的钱，存到银行里去。仅据营口市上半年的统计，储蓄总额达一百二十二万九千元，和去年同期比较，增加了50％还多。这个市东站街的职工家属李桂卿，家有五口人，丈夫每月的工资是五十七元，由于她精打细算，不但全家生活过得不错，每月还能节约六斤粮，还有十二元的定期储蓄。据鞍山市的统计，七、八月全市妇女共节约粮食十五万多斤，近半年来全市妇女节约用煤一万四千多吨。抚顺市建设街有两个居民小组把炉子改装后，每月平均能节约煤二千八百五十斤。
    鞍山、营口等四个市的妇女还积极参加了养鸡、养猪、种菜等多种多样的副业生产，增加了家庭收入。营口市从事织席、糊盒副业生产的就有三千多户，每户每月平均收入二十元左右。
