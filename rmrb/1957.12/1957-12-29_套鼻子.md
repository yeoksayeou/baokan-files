The way to play is to hold the long handle of the human head model with one hand, and through various movements, put the ring tied with a thin string onto the long nose.

    套鼻子
    “套鼻子”，是苏联国民教育展览会上展出的儿童玩具之一（见上图）。这件玩具在展览会上展出时，是用塑料做成的。如果大家有兴趣，可以用薄木板做人头模型，套鼻子的圈圈用藤子或粗铅丝做都行。玩的方法，是用一只手拿着人头模型的长柄，通过各种动作，把细长线拴住的圈圈套到长鼻子上去。这种玩具，可以锻炼孩子们动作的准确性，同时也可以培养孩子们的耐性。（附图片）
