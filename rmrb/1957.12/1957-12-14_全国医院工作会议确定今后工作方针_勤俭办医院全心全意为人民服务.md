Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: The National Hospital Work Conference was held in Beijing from the 2nd to the 12th. More than 400 people attended the meeting, including directors of health bureaus from various provinces (autonomous regions) and cities, as well as presidents and technical experts from various types of hospitals.

The conference affirmed the tremendous achievements of hospital work since liberation. It was believed that with the restoration and development of the national economy, hospitals across the country have not only developed and improved in cities and coastal areas, but have also seen greater development in industrial and mining enterprises, vast rural areas, and ethnic minority regions. Hospital work is oriented towards industrial and agricultural production and the broad masses of working people, fundamentally changing the nature of hospitals in old China, which served a small number of ruling classes.

Based on the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, this conference clarified that the future direction of hospital work is to run hospitals diligently and thriftily, and to establish a medical attitude of serving the people wholeheartedly. The conference believes that consolidating the leadership of the Communist Party over hospital work, strengthening political and ideological work in hospitals, and implementing the Party's various guidelines and policies are the keys to running hospitals well. Therefore, the conference made a special report on political work in hospitals and conducted a heated discussion. The conference pointed out that for hospital work, diligence means actively exerting initiative, continuously improving the quality of medical care, and serving patients diligently and conscientiously; thrift, on the one hand, means conservation, and on the other hand, means fully utilizing the existing human and material resources of medical and health institutions. Diligence and thrift do not mean lowering quality, nor does it mean simplifying everything. The boundary is to proceed from the 600 million people and serve the people wholeheartedly.

The conference discussed issues such as reforming the medical system and facilitating people's access to medical care. The conference believes that implementing a three-shift outpatient system in the morning, afternoon, and evening is a good way to facilitate patients, tap potential, and change service attitudes. It should be gradually implemented in cities, but the methods do not need to be uniform. In rural areas, it is required to provide medical treatment as soon as patients arrive and to conduct mobile medical services. Hospitals and grassroots medical institutions in urban and rural areas should gradually develop simple beds, under the condition of ensuring the quality of medical care, to meet the needs of the broad masses.

The conference also discussed the issue of expanding prevention and using hospitals as the center to guide local and industrial and mining hygiene and prevention work. It was believed that hospital work must implement the principle of combining health work with mass movements, and medical personnel should go to the masses, publicize health and birth control knowledge, and guide the masses to carry out patriotic health campaigns. Furthermore, it was believed that hospitals and sanatoriums should be gradually handed over to local unified management. The conference also discussed the issues of uniting Chinese and Western medicine and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and further clarified that this is a matter of the path of hospital work in our country, which must be further and correctly implemented.

    全国医院工作会议确定今后工作方针
    勤俭办医院全心全意为人民服务
    新华社13日讯　全国医院工作会议2日到12日在北京举行。参加会议的有各省（自治区）、市卫生厅局长和各类医院的院长、技术专家共四百多人。
    会议肯定了解放以来医院工作的巨大成绩，认为，随着国民经济的恢复和发展，全国医院不仅在城市和沿海地区有所发展和提高，在工矿企业、广大农村和少数民族地区有更大的发展；医院工作面向工农业生产、面向广大劳动群众，从根本上改变了旧中国医院为少数统治阶级服务的性质。
    这次会议根据中共中央三中全会的精神，明确了今后医院工作的方针是勤俭办医院，树立全心全意为人民服务的医疗态度。会议认为，巩固地树立共产党对医院工作的领导，加强医院中的政治思想工作，贯彻党的各项方针政策，是办好医院的关键。因此，会议对医院政治工作问题作了专题报告，进行了热烈的讨论。会议指出：对医院工作来说，勤就是积极发挥能动性，不断提高医疗质量，勤勤恳恳，为病人服务；俭，一方面是节约，一方面就是充分发挥医药卫生机构现有人力、物力的作用。勤俭不是降低质量，也不是一切从简，界限就是从六亿人民出发，全心全意为人民服务。
    会议讨论了改革医疗制度，便利人民就医等问题。会议认为，实行上午、下午、晚上三班门诊制度，这是便利病人，发挥潜力，改变服务态度的好办法，在城市里要逐步实行，但方式不必强求一律；在农村里要求作到随到随诊，巡回医疗等。各地城乡的医院和基层的医疗机构中，在保证医疗质量的条件下，应当逐步发展简易病床，以适应广大群众的要求。
    会议还讨论了扩大预防，以医院为中心指导地方和工矿的卫生预防工作的问题，认为医院工作必须贯彻卫生工作和群众运动相结合的原则，医务人员应该走向群众，宣传卫生、节育的知识，指导群众开展爱国卫生运动。并且认为医院和疗养院应逐步交地方统一管理。会议也讨论了团结中西医和学习苏联先进经验的问题，更明确了这是关系到我国医院工作的道路问题，必须进一步正确地贯彻。
