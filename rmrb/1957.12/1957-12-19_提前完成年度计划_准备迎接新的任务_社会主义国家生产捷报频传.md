    Fulfilling Annual Plans Ahead of Schedule: Preparing to Greet New Tasks.
    Socialist Countries Frequently Report Production Successes.
    Soviet Union
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th] As the year draws to a close, good news of various economic regions in the Soviet Union fulfilling their 1957 production plans ahead of schedule and exceeding their quotas has been pouring in. So far, economic regions such as Moscow City, Moscow Oblast, Leningrad, Kiev, Belarus, Kalinin, Odessa, Lviv, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Smolensk have successively completed their annual production plans one month or half a month ahead of schedule, exceeding their quotas.
    This year, the enthusiasm of workers and staff in factories and enterprises across the Soviet Union has been particularly high in the socialist production competition commemorating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, so the achievements obtained are also very great. In particular, the achievements made in vigorously adopting advanced technologies, making full use of resources, exploring potentials in many aspects, and improving labor productivity are even more remarkable. This year, factories in economic regions such as the Urals, Ukraine, Siberia, and Moscow manufactured hundreds of new types of highly productive and extremely precise machines. This year, almost all factories in the Soviet Union installed various advanced technology machines.
    This year's all-Soviet socialist production competition has been very successful in increasing output, improving labor productivity, and reducing production costs. The Moscow Oblast economic region completed the state plan half a month ahead of schedule, exceeding its quota, and its total output increased by 10% compared to last year. The Belarusian economic region completed its production plan twenty days ahead of schedule, and its total output increased by 17% compared to last year.
    These achievements are primarily due to the implementation of industrial management reforms. Because after the establishment of economic administrative regions in various localities, management is closer to production, enabling rapid resolution of production problems and full utilization of production potential and production enthusiasm.
    Romania
    [Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest] Many industrial and mining enterprises in Romania have already fulfilled and exceeded the annual plans stipulated by the state for this year.
    According to newspaper reports, more than 120 enterprises in counties such as Stalin, Prahova, Constanța, Baia Mare, etc., have already completed their annual plans ahead of schedule. In the heavy industry sector, metallurgical factories, tractor and automobile factories, and coal mines in Hunedoara and Reșița have also completed their annual plans. The Stalin City Tractor Factory completed its annual plan forty days ahead of schedule, saving more than 10 million lei and increasing labor productivity by 5.6%.
    "Scînteia" newspaper, in analyzing the reasons why many enterprises completed their annual plans ahead of schedule, said that this is mainly because these departments adopted advanced production methods in their work and fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses.
    Poland
    [Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw] Many enterprise departments in Poland have completed their production plans for this year ahead of schedule. In the mining industry, three iron mines in the Częstochowa area are the first enterprises in the country to complete their annual plans. By the end of this year, they will have overproduced approximately 24,000 tons of iron ore for the country. Polish miners mined more than 900,000 tons of coal for the country in the first eleven months of this year, and they created the highest monthly coal production record of the year in November.
    Good news of production has also come from provinces such as Krakow, Poznan, Gdansk, and Bydgoszcz. Enterprises in Krakow that completed their annual plans ahead of schedule include the Krakow Steel Mill and the "Skawina" Aluminum Factory.
    Albania
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tirana] According to a report by the Albanian Telegraph Agency, more than 70% of enterprises in Albania have completed their annual plans for this year ahead of schedule. Currently, news of the working people achieving new successes is constantly coming from various places.
    Some enterprises completed their annual plans one or two months ago, including enterprises in the steel industry, cement industry, soil improvement, construction industry, and machine tractor stations.
    These achievements of the Albanian working people are the result of large-scale socialist labor competitions.

　　提前完成年度计划　准备迎接新的任务
    社会主义国家生产捷报频传
    苏联
    本报莫斯科18日电　在接近年终之时，苏联各经济区提前超额完成1957年生产计划的捷报纷纷传来。到目前为止已有莫斯科市、莫斯科州、列宁格勒、基辅、白俄罗斯、加里宁、敖德萨、里沃夫、拉脱维亚、立陶宛、爱沙尼亚、斯摩林斯克等经济区先后提前一个月或半个月超额完成了全年生产计划。
    今年，全苏各地工厂企业的职工在纪念十月革命四十周年的社会主义生产竞赛中劲头特别大，所以获得的成绩也很大。尤其是在大力采用先进技术、充分利用资源、多方面发掘潜力和提高劳动生产率等方面，所取得的成就更为显著。在这一年里乌拉尔、乌克兰、西伯利亚、莫斯科等经济区的工厂制造出数百种新型的具有高度生产能力和极精密的机器。这一年差不多全苏所有工厂都安装了各式先进技术的机器。
    今年的全苏社会主义生产竞赛在增加产量、提高劳动生产率和减低生产成本三个方面很有成绩。莫斯科州经济区提前半月超额完成了国家计划，它的总产量比去年提高了10％。白俄罗斯经济区提前二十天完成了生产计划，总产量比去年提高了17％。
    这些成就首先是由于实现了工业管理改革。因为各地成立了经济行政区后，管理接近了生产，能迅速解决生产中的问题，充分发挥生产潜力和生产积极性。
    罗马尼亚
    据新华社布加勒斯特电　罗马尼亚有许多工矿企业已经提前和超额完成了国家所规定的今年年度计划。
    据报纸消息，在斯大、彼林特什蒂、康斯坦萨、巴雅、马雷等州，已经有一百二十多个企业单位提前完成了年度计划。在重工业部门方面，洪尼多阿拉、雷希察的冶金工厂、拖拉机和汽车工厂以及煤矿等也已完成了年度计划。斯大林城的拖拉机工厂提前四十天完成了年度计划，节约了一千多万列依，劳动生产率提高了5.6％。
    “火花报”在分析许多企业单位提前完成年度计划的原因时说，这主要是由于这些部门在劳动中采取了先进生产方法，充分地发挥了群众的积极性。
    波兰
    据新华社华沙电　波兰有许多企业部门提前完成了今年的生产计划。在采矿业方面，切斯托霍伐等地区的三个铁矿是全国最先完成全年计划的企业。到今年年底，它们将为国家超额生产大约二万四千吨铁矿砂。波兰的矿工们在今年头十一个月内为国家多开采了九十多万吨煤，他们在11月份创造了今年月采煤量的最高纪录。
    克拉科夫、波兹南、革但斯克、比得哥煦等省也传来了生产捷报。克拉科夫提前完成年度计划的企业有克拉科夫炼钢厂、“斯卡维纳”制铝工厂。
    阿尔巴尼亚
    据新华社地拉那电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，阿尔巴尼亚已经有70％以上的企业提前完成了今年的年度计划。目前，各地不断传来劳动人民获得新成就的消息。
    有些企业在一、两个月以前就已经完成了年度计划，这里面包括炼钢工业、水泥工业、土壤改良、建筑工业等部门的企业以及机器拖拉机站等。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民的这些成就是进行大规模社会主义劳动竞赛的结果。
