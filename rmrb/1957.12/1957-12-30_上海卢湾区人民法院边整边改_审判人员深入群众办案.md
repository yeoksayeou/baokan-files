Shanghai Luwan District People's Court Rectifies While Reforming
Adjudicators Go Deep into the Masses to Handle Cases

(Our Dispatch) Now, in the Shanghai Luwan District People's Court, unless there are meetings, you can't find anyone in the office: judges and clerks are taking case files to the neighborhoods and factories to handle cases. This is a new phenomenon emerging from the rectification process in the Luwan District People's Court.

Going deep among the masses, going deep into reality, and relying on the masses to handle cases is an important measure taken by the Luwan District People's Court in its rectification. This measure, after discussion and practice by the masses, has become a regular working system. Its effectiveness has also been fully demonstrated. This effect is vividly reflected in the comparison of handling the following two cases. In July and August of this year, the court accepted a case where a resident lost a hen, and another resident found they had an extra hen. The two residents had a dispute, and mediation by the neighborhood committee failed, so they went to court. Two court sessions and one execution took more than a dozen labor forces and lasted a month to settle this lawsuit caused by a hen. Recently, the court accepted a case of inheritance dispute, involving as many as twenty parties. In addition to some cash, the inheritance also included some clothing and furniture, which was difficult to distribute. According to the residents, "This kind of lawsuit would not produce results even if it were fought for two years!" But this time, the judges no longer sat in court to interrogate, but took the case to the district, relied on neighborhood organizations and residents, and quickly clarified the situation. As a result, only two family meetings were held to satisfactorily settle this difficult case.

The smooth implementation of this important measure is inseparable from the initiative of the court's leading cadres to go downstairs and quickly change their work style. Several presidents of the court have already started handling cases themselves. Vice President Zhang An alone concluded seventeen cases in November, and another vice president also often goes to the districts with judges to handle cases.

    上海卢湾区人民法院边整边改
    审判人员深入群众办案
    本报讯　现在，上海市卢湾区人民法院机关只要不开会，在办公室里就找不到人了：审判员和书记员都带着卷宗下里弄、下工厂去办案了。这是卢湾区人民法院在整改中出现的新气象。
    深入群众，深入实际，依靠群众办案，这是卢湾区人民法院进行整改的一项重要措施。这项措施，经过群众的讨论和实践，已经成为一项经常的工作制度。它的效果也已经充分地显示出来了。这个效果从处理下面两个案件的对比中得到了生动的反映。今年7、8月间，这个法院受理了这样一个案件：一个居民家里走失了一只老母鸡，一个居民家里又多了一只老母鸡，这两家居民发生了争执，里弄调解无效，就告到法院来了。两次开庭，一次执行，花了十几个劳动力，前后历时一月，才把这一桩由一只老母鸡所引起的诉讼案了结了。最近，这个法院受理了一宗遗产纠纷，当事人有二十个之多，这笔遗产除了一部分现金以外，还有一些衣服和家具，这是很难分配的。按照居民的说法：“这种官司打两年也打不出结果来！”但这一次，审判员不再坐堂问案了，而是带着案件到地区里去，依靠里弄组织和居民群众，很快就把情况摸清楚了，结果只开了两次家庭会议，就把这个疑难案件圆满地了结了。
    这项重要措施之能够顺利贯彻，是同这个法院的领导干部的主动下楼、迅速转变作风分不开的。这个法院的几个院长早已动手办案。副院长张岸一个人在11月份就结了十七件案子，另一个副院长也经常同审判员一起下地区办案。
