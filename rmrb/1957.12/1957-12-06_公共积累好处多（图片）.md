　　Public Accumulation Brings Many Benefits
The Happiness Road Agricultural Cooperative in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, has accumulated more than 86,000 yuan in public funds as production continues to increase. This has created conditions for expanded reproduction and fully demonstrates the superiority of collective management. The cooperative's production has exceeded the level of local well-to-do middle peasants, and the living standards of 97% of the cooperative members have also exceeded the level of local well-to-do middle peasants.

The cooperative's trial calculation results for this year show that the total grain output was 3.15 million jin, with an average yield of 3,526 jin per hectare, 826 jin higher than the unit area yield of local well-to-do middle peasants before the cooperative was established. The average net income per capita in the cooperative reached 121.5 yuan, an increase of 73.57% compared to the income of local well-to-do middle peasants before the cooperative was established.

　　公共积累好处多
    吉林省蛟河县幸福之路农业社，随着生产的不断提高，全社已有八万六千多元的公共积累，这给扩大再生产创造了条件，充分显示了集体经营的优越性。全社生产已超过当地富裕中农水平。超过当地富裕中农的生活水平的社员也达97％。
    这个社今年试算结果：粮食总产量为三百十五万斤，平均每公顷产量三千五百二十六斤，比入社前当地富裕中农的单位面积产量高出八百二十六斤。全社平均每口人的纯收入达一百二十一元五角，比入社前当地富裕中农收入增加73.57％。
