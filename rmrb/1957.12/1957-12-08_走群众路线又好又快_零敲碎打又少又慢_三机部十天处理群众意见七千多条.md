Following the Mass Line is Good and Fast; Piecemeal Work is Slow and Inefficient.
The Third Ministry of Machine Building Processes Over 7,000 Mass Opinions in Ten Days

    (Our Dispatch) In the rectification campaign, the Third Ministry of Machine Building implemented the mass line and quickly formed a mass-based rectification upsurge. In a short ten days, more than 60% of the more than 12,000 opinions raised by the masses during the great blooming and contending were processed.

    During the great blooming and contending, more than 4,000 big-character posters were put up in the Third Ministry of Machine Building, and many symposiums were held at the same time. The big-character posters, like drilling machines, exposed many problems existing in the ministry. At this time, the ministry leadership called on leaders at all levels to implement the mass line and carry out large-scale rectification and improvement. However, how to specifically implement the mass line in the rectification campaign? At first, everyone was relatively unfamiliar with it. Some units (such as the Administrative Office) leaders could not think of a solution when faced with the hundreds of opinions raised by the masses. When the ministry leaders criticized them for the slow progress of rectification, they frantically carried out rectification, and although some problems were solved piecemeal, the actual effect was not great. Some units (such as the Design Institute) leaders worked hard every day to study and improve work plans, and some problems that were easy to improve were also addressed, but the leadership’s rectification plans were not shared with the masses, making it impossible for the vast majority of the masses to participate in the rectification work. Still other units, upon hearing that the process was moving to rectification, the leading group announced solutions to certain problems one after another without sufficient research. However, these solutions were full of general and conceptual phrases such as "sincerely accept opinions," "work hard to improve in the future," and "prepare to take measures on certain issues," and so on.

    After discovering these situations during inspections, the ministry leading group quickly conducted research and believed that the main reason for the slow progress of the rectification work was the incorrect rectification method. Most leading cadres acknowledged the need to follow the mass line in rectification, but there were many problems that urgently needed to be solved regarding how to specifically implement the mass line in rectification. Therefore, the leading group instructed each department and bureau to conduct rectification in conjunction with the masses, overcoming the tendency of "rectification behind closed doors," and changing the piecemeal and ad hoc approach. At the same time, they called on all staff to actively participate in rectification, supervise rectification, and criticize the erroneous ideas of some masses who "only care about blooming and contending, not about rectification" and "we bloom and contend, the leaders rectify." On the other hand, the ministry's rectification leading group immediately dispatched leaders such as the vice minister and assistant minister to go deep into various units to specifically help comrades analyze the situation and explore specific methods of relying on the masses to carry out rectification.

    After these specific measures were taken, the mass-based rectification upsurge in the ministry quickly formed. In just ten days, more than 60% of the mass opinions were processed. Some relatively good experiences were also explored on how to specifically rely on the masses and follow the mass line. For example, the method they adopted when solving issues related to the welfare of all staff was: first, the problems raised by the masses were classified according to their nature and ranked in order, summarized into eleven issues such as housing, shuttle buses, meals, and medical care, and eleven special rectification groups were established. The group members were mainly from the competent business departments, and people who originally raised the opinions were absorbed, or representatives elected by them participated in drafting preliminary improvement plans, which were submitted to the ministry leading group for review, and then distributed to all staff for discussion. After mass discussion, a decision was made as soon as a relatively consistent opinion was reached on a problem, and it was announced to the masses. At the same time, issues that needed to be explained to the masses and expressed an attitude were also made as specific and practical as possible, so that the people who raised the opinions were convinced. Because this method of fully relying on the masses was adopted, problems could be solved in batches and centrally. For example, more than 90% of the more than 500 opinions raised on the Administrative Office were correctly processed in one week. For problems involving two or more units within the ministry, the method of "bilateral" or "multilateral" talks was adopted, inviting people who raised the opinions and comrades from the relevant units to participate in research or debate. In addition, problems involving only two people were resolved individually.

    It is particularly noteworthy that while focusing on solving general smaller (but numerous) and easy-to-solve problems, the ministry also paid attention to solving some major but solvable problems. For example, the foreign order problem of the Instrument Design Institute of the Third Bureau was submitted to the masses for discussion after a preliminary study by the institute's leadership. The masses believed that four items could be reduced from the original order. At this time, the leadership made further research based on the opinions of the masses and proposed a new plan, which was submitted to the masses for discussion. The masses proposed another plan on the basis of the new plan. Finally, after repeated discussions between the leadership and the masses, it was jointly determined that twenty-five items could be reduced from foreign orders without affecting the work, which saved the state 170,000 yuan in foreign exchange.

    Now, the mass-based rectification upsurge in the Third Ministry of Machine Building has been deeply developed. According to the person in charge of the ministry, the work of centralized general rectification in advanced units such as the First Bureau and the Seventh Bureau has basically ended, and other units can also complete the general rectification work before December 10 under the condition that everyone works together and comes up with ideas, and it is expected that nearly 10,000 mass opinions can be processed. In order to make this mass-based large-scale rectification and improvement work fast and good, the ministry's rectification leading group has organized seven rectification inspection teams to go deep into various units to carry out inspections to promote the progress of rectification work.

### 走群众路线又好又快　零敲碎打又少又慢  三机部十天处理群众意见七千多条

    走群众路线又好又快　零敲碎打又少又慢
    三机部十天处理群众意见七千多条
    本报讯　在整改工作中，第三机械工业部贯彻了群众路线，很快形成群众性的整改高潮。在短短的十天之中，将鸣放中群众提出的一万二千多条意见，处理了60％以上。
    在大鸣大放中，三机部共贴出了四千多张大字报，同时举行了多次的座谈会。大字报像钻探机一样，把部里存在的许多问题都揭发出来了。这时，部的领导上就号召各级领导上要贯彻群众路线，进行大整大改。但是，究竟怎样在整改工作中贯彻群众路线呢？开始时大家还比较生疏。有些单位（如行政处）的领导干部面对着群众提出的千百条意见，一下想不出解决办法。当部领导上批评他们整改工作进展迟缓时，他们就手忙脚乱地进行整改，虽然枝枝节节的解决了一些问题，但实际效果并不大；有些单位
  （如设计院）的领导干部天天辛辛苦苦地研究改进工作方案，对于容易改进的问题也着手解决了一些，但是，领导上的整改方案没有告诉群众，使得广大群众无法参加到整改工作中来。还有一些单位听说要转入整改了，领导小组不经过充分研究，就接二连三地公布对某些问题的解决方案。然而在这些方案中却充满了笼统和概念化的词句，如“诚恳接受意见”、“今后努力改进”、
  “对某项问题准备采取措施”等等。
    部领导小组在检查中发现这些情况以后，很快进行了研究，认为整改工作迟缓的主要原因是整改的方法不对。整改要走群众路线，多数领导干部是承认了，但是如何在整改中具体贯彻群众路线却有很多问题急需要加以解决。因此，领导小组一方面指示各司、局要求他们必须结合群众进行整改，克服“关门整改”的偏向；改变零敲碎打和就事论事的做法；同时号召全体工作人员积极参与整改、监督整改，批判部分群众中存在着的“只管鸣放，不管整改”和“我们鸣放，领导整改”的错误想法。另一方面，部整风领导小组即刻派副部长、部长助理等领导同志分别深入到各个单位，具体帮助下面同志分析情况，摸索依靠群众进行整改的具体方法。
    在采取了这些具体措施之后，该部群众性的整改高潮很快形成了，在短短的十天之内，就处理了群众意见60％以上。在如何具体地依靠群众、走群众路线的问题上，也摸索到一些比较好的经验。如他们在解决有关全体工作人员的生活福利时所采用的方法是：首先把群众提出的问题按性质分类排队，归纳成住房、班车、伙食、医疗卫生等十一个问题，成立十一个专门整改小组。小组成员以业务主管部门为主，吸收原提意见的人，或由他们选出代表参加，拟定初步改进方案，提交部领导小组审查，然后分发给全体工作人员讨论。经过群众讨论，当一个问题取得了比较一致的意见之后即行定案，并向群众公布。同时将需要向群众解释和表示态度的问题也尽量具体切实，使提意见的人心服口服。由于采用了这种充分依靠群众的方法，可以成批地集中地解决问题。如对行政处提出的五百多条意见，在一个星期之内就正确地处理了90％以上。有些牵涉到部内两个单位或几个单位的问题，就采用了“双边”或“多边”会谈的方式，邀请提意见的人和有关单位的同志参加研究或辩论。此外，问题仅是牵涉到两个人之间的，则采取个别解决的方式。
    特别值得注意的是，该部在集中解决一般比较小的（而是大量的）容易解决的问题的时候，也注意解决一些比较重大但可以解决的问题。如三局仪器设计所的国外定货问题，经所领导上初步研究之后，提交群众进行讨论。群众认为原来的订货可以减去四项。这时领导上根据群众的意见作进一步研究，并拟出一个新的方案，交群众讨论。群众在新方案的基础上又拟定了一个方案。最后领导和群众经过反复的讨论，共同确定在不影响工作的条件下国外订货可以减去二十五个项目，这就为国家节约了外汇十七万元。
    现在，第三机械工业部群众性的整改高潮已经深入开展起来。据该部负责人谈，先进单位如一局、七局等集中进行一般整改的工作已经基本结束，其他单位在大家齐动手，共同出主意的情况下，在12月10日以前也可以完成一般整改工作，预计可以处理群众意见近万条。为了使这个群众性的大整大改工作做的又快又好，该部整风领导小组又组织了七个整改检查组，深入各单位进行检查，以推动整改工作的进展。
