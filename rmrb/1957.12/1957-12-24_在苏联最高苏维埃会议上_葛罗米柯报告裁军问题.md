Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 22nd (TASS dispatch): Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko delivered a speech on December 21st at the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting. The full text of the speech is as follows:

Comrade Representatives!

On behalf of the Soviet Council of Ministers, I am entrusted to answer some representatives' inquiries regarding the results of discussions on disarmament issues among various countries and the possibility of reaching an agreement on this issue.

The Soviet government is deeply concerned that, despite continuous efforts by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries to stop the arms race and eliminate the threat of a new war, the disarmament issue has not been practically resolved. As you all know, negotiations on disarmament have been ongoing within the United Nations for ten years, and have yet to reach an agreement, and are now even interrupted. This is because our main opponents in the disarmament negotiations, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, who sing the same tune as them, as the facts show, are unwilling to undertake any obligations in limiting armaments and restricting the accumulation and development of nuclear weapons. Let us look at the facts.

The US, British, and French Governments Have Long Been Engaged in Activities Completely Opposed to the Task of Disarmament

While the United Nations Disarmament Commission and Sub-committee, and sometimes the United Nations General Assembly, have been conducting lengthy and fruitless discussions on disarmament issues, the US, British, and French governments have in reality been engaged in activities completely opposed to the task of disarmament.

While the United States and the United Kingdom pretend at the negotiating table to be exploring an agreement on disarmament issues, in reality, these countries are frantically expanding their armaments, demanding that their partners in the North Atlantic Group hand over more and more troops to the command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and increasing their already enormous military expenditures. With the support of the United Kingdom and certain member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization military bloc, the United States is desperately pushing for the armament of West Germany, wanting to make West Germany's economic power and manpower serve the military plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The Soviet government, adhering to the Leninist principles of the Soviet state's foreign policy, has submitted numerous proposals to the United Nations aimed at putting disarmament on a realistic path. As you know, the Soviet government has proposed achieving the complete prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, eliminating these weapons from the arsenals of all countries, and ceasing the production and destroying the stockpiles of these weapons. The Soviet proposals also stipulate a significant reduction in the number of armed forces, armaments, and military budgets.

The Soviet government has carefully studied the proposals of Western countries in order to find common ground and to arrive at something acceptable to both Western countries and ourselves. In many cases, the Soviet Union has adopted the suggestions of Western countries. For example, on the issue of setting limits on the number of armed forces of major powers. However, all this has not led to any results. When the Soviet Union compromises with the proposals of Western countries, new obstacles immediately arise, because the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France change their minds again, abandoning the proposals that they had insisted on adopting yesterday.

As in the past, the United States and the United Kingdom evade the resolution of the disarmament issue, entangling the achievement of an agreement on this issue with some far-fetched and unenforceable conditions, especially measures related to disarmament supervision. Issues such as the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the elimination of these weapons from armaments, the reduction of military spending and military budgets, the removal of military bases on foreign territories, and the withdrawal of foreign troops separately from member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact, are not mentioned at all in the proposals of Western countries. This alone can prove how far the governments of these countries are from promoting the success of disarmament negotiations.

Furthermore, they artificially raise political issues that have nothing to do with disarmament, such as the German question, as a precondition for reaching an agreement on the reduction of armed forces. Even on a relatively simple issue such as stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, they entangle it with other, much more complex disarmament issues (on which, due to the position of Western countries, there is currently no possibility of reaching an agreement).

Western Countries Have Always Wanted to Maintain Hegemonic Power in the UN Disarmament Organization

It should be pointed out that the atmosphere of disarmament negotiations has also been very abnormal in recent years. In the United Nations Disarmament Commission Sub-committee (where disarmament negotiations have mainly taken place for nearly three years), the Soviet Union has been opposed by the four member states of the North Atlantic Group: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Canada. They have resisted all proposals that do not conform to the policies of this military group. As a result, the Sub-committee has not made any progress in drafting a disarmament agreement, but has instead become a curtain to cover up the arms expansion of Western countries.

The US and British governments, as well as some of their partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, are using the United Nations disarmament organization to obstruct the achievement of an agreement, while also trying to create the impression that negotiations are progressing and that an agreement on the disarmament issue is about to be reached. Naturally, in this situation, the Soviet government cannot help but draw certain conclusions. At the recent United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet government proposed the establishment of a disarmament committee composed of all United Nations member states. The establishment of this committee would enable all these countries, both large and small, to directly participate in the discussion of issues of concern to the people of all countries. Of course, this alone cannot solve the problem, but this method of negotiation can put an end to closed-door secret discussions and enable the people to supervise disarmament negotiations.

Can anyone who truly values the disarmament demands of the people of all countries and seeks a way out of the negotiation stalemate oppose this proposal? No, they cannot.

However, Western countries, especially the United States, resolutely opposed this proposal.

Another proposal was put forward at the United Nations General Assembly, which was endorsed by the Soviet government. This is the proposal put forward by Albania, and supported by many other countries, which stipulates the establishment of a smaller disarmament committee, in which at least half of the participants should be socialist countries and countries pursuing a neutral policy. This proposal should, in principle, be acceptable to all countries, because the more extensive participation of countries pursuing a peaceful policy would help achieve success in disarmament negotiations. However, Western countries also opposed this proposal, attempting to maintain the hegemonic power of member states of their military group in the United Nations disarmament organization.

As before, the United States does not hesitate to exert crude pressure on countries dependent on it in order to prevent the establishment of an agency capable of conducting effective negotiations.

Although the United States had to agree to some expansion of the current committee, it did so in such a way that the United States and its allies in the military bloc still maintain a large majority among the new members of the committee, so that sixteen of the twenty-five participating countries on the committee are members of the Western military bloc.

The fact that the United States and the British government forcibly passed a proposal at the United Nations General Assembly that attempts to predetermine that further research on disarmament issues should be conducted within the scope they have prescribed and under their conditions can only be explained by the reason that it is an advocacy to undermine and attempt to bury the disarmament agreement. This tactic has never succeeded in the past, and will not succeed in the future, and proposals that attempt to force the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries to accept conditions that they cannot accept are simply unworkable. In view of all these circumstances, the Soviet Union has had to declare that it cannot participate in the work of this committee, because the actual purpose of this committee is merely to continue to obstruct the cause of disarmament and deceive the people.

The US and British governments have always sought to gain their military advantage by undermining the Soviet Union's security interests, and for this purpose, they have exploited the well-known Soviet concern for disarmament and for the consolidation of peace. Furthermore, doesn't the US government's persistent obstruction of the equal participation of the People's China with other major powers in the discussion of disarmament issues expose the US government's unwillingness to deal with disarmament issues realistically? The US government puts itself in an awkward position: some of the proposals on disarmament measures put forward by Western countries, according to the claims of these countries, these proposals should also involve the People's Republic of China, but the US government still does not change its attitude, as if the great China does not exist in the world. So it is no wonder that more and more Americans are beginning to point out that the United States' attitude towards China is absurd.

After the Bankruptcy of US and UK's So-Called Atomic Superiority, they Continue to Clamor for the Cold War

For a long time, the United States and the United Kingdom have been counting on the fact that they have a so-called advantage in atomic armaments. Therefore, they have confidently believed that since the advantage is on the side of the United States and the United Kingdom, why disarm? But life shows that this wishful thinking has fallen through. The beautiful dream that had intoxicated the leaders of these countries for almost the entire post-war period has now been shattered. Their beautiful dream has vanished into thin air due to the recent great achievements of Soviet science and technology. But have the leading groups of the above-mentioned countries learned any useful lessons from this? Unfortunately, they have not learned anything yet. The decision-makers of the foreign policies of the United States and the United Kingdom currently believe that since the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States and the United Kingdom in the development of science and technology, then they should first catch up with the Soviet Union, and promote the arms race on an even larger scale, especially in the production of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and rockets. Of course, this approach can only satisfy the appetite of large monopoly capital, enabling them to obtain more and more profits from the production of weapons, but this approach is contrary to the vital interests of the people.

The arms race is more dangerous at present than at any time in the past, because the destructive power of the latest weapons is incomparable to the weapons used in World War II. Moreover, military technology will not stand still under the drive of the arms race.

The responsible leaders of Western countries should have understood long ago that disarmament is not a diplomatic bargaining chip, but the most pressing task of modern times. The people of all countries are increasingly resolutely demanding the rapid resolution of this task. No matter how much they play voting tricks in the United Nations, no matter how much they clamor for the continuation of the "Cold War," they cannot erase this demand, nor can they remove it from the agenda. The solidarity of socialist countries, the increasingly consolidated mutual understanding and cooperation among countries defending peace, has today become such a factor that even the most stubborn advocates of arms expansion cannot but take it into account. The current world situation is even different from what it was just a few months ago. The Soviet Earth satellites have improved the political atmosphere on our planet, and they are carrying out enormous work that is beneficial to peace and also beneficial to disarmament.

The Organizers of the NATO Summit Did Not Get What They Wanted

The organizers of this meeting of the North Atlantic Council have put in a lot of effort, attempting to turn this meeting into a demonstration of the solidarity of the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization around the policy of war preparedness and the arms race. However, the meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization showed that this plan did not get what it wanted, and the fact that the participants had to break the agenda that had already been formulated in Washington and London and raise some issues that were far from the purpose of this military group for discussion already explained many problems. It is enough to mention the following situation, namely, that the participants in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting were forced to study some issues related to disarmament negotiations, and also discussed the proposals of the Soviet government stated in the letter of Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Bulganin to the heads of government of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries and in the note to all member states of the United Nations. According to foreign newspapers, the Soviet Union seemed to be invisibly participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting, influencing the entire process of the meeting. Norway, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, and some other countries all advocated carefully studying the Soviet proposals. The American newspaper "The Washington Post and Times Herald" commented on the situation of the meeting as follows: "What is happening in Paris now is a revolt against Dulles' habit of rejecting any proposal put forward by the Soviet Union, and the scale of this revolt is not yet clear."

The plan to establish a network of American rocket launch bases in the territories of European countries and to establish storage depots for nuclear warheads for these rockets has been met with serious resistance. Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen said that Norway will not allow the establishment of atomic weapons depots or the installation of medium-range ballistic missile launch platforms on its territory. Danish Prime Minister Hansen also made a statement on behalf of Denmark in the same tone. The Soviet government gives due credit to the sober assessment of the situation made by the leaders of the above-mentioned Scandinavian countries.

The residents of West Germany are deeply disturbed by the American plan to turn West Germany into a storage site for atomic and hydrogen weapons, and this sentiment has also had some influence on the position of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting. Federal Chancellor Adenauer had to make a statement that West Germany would not hurriedly decide on the issue of establishing American rocket launch bases on its territory. The statement of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on the issue of American rocket bases can be considered as a tendency to consider the interests of West Germany more wisely, but this statement is inconsistent with Adenauer's insistence on supplying the West German Federal Defense Forces with various weapons and involving West Germany in research on the production of modern weapons, including rockets.

It cannot be ignored that some people in West Germany have not learned any lessons from the past wars and are eyeing an appropriate time to try to push West Germany onto the path of war again. If atomic weapons were to fall into the hands of these people, it could have extremely serious consequences. The following fact illustrates this point: today some prominent figures in West Germany are shamelessly saying that they do not agree with the existing borders of some European countries. Would this measure of arming West German troops with atomic weapons not trigger a dangerous atomic arms race among European countries?

The Tendency to Demand a Cessation of the Arms Race is Increasingly Strongly Displayed

However, the entire development of the situation shows that the results of the recent North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting also show to a certain extent that the tendency to demand the guarantee of conditions for peaceful coexistence among countries and the cessation of the arms race is increasingly strongly displayed in international relations. We are excited to see how broad a positive response and understanding the recent appeal of the Soviet government to the governments of eighty-three countries and the Soviet government's proposals on ways to consolidate peace have received in various places, including among the broad social circles of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries. Isn't this another powerful proof that the foreign policy of the Soviet state determined by the Communist Party and its Central Committee is in line with the expectations of the vast majority of mankind? (Applause) This policy has gained the support of hundreds of millions of people who were still misled by war propaganda yesterday. Hundreds of millions of people in the East and the West are looking with expectation and confidence at the Soviet Union, which has always firmly defended the great cause of international peace.

In the just-published communique of the participants of the North Atlantic Council meeting, there is a passage expressing a willingness to participate in the foreign ministers' meeting on disarmament issues. It is not difficult to see that the insertion of such a passage in the communique is the result of the difficult situation of the advocates of arms expansion and the "Cold War." The United States Secretary of State (this passage is easily identified as having been written by him) had to add a superficially comforting tone, while in reality trying to mislead the people of all countries who truly hope to stop the arms race and the "Cold War." Everyone knows clearly that it has been less than a month since the United Nations, under the crude pressure of the United States, passed a resolution endorsing the position of Western countries on disarmament, which is to say, endorsing the position of those who do not want to disarm at all and who want to bring the disarmament negotiations to a deadlock. Now, in reality, someone is again suggesting that we sit down again with those member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with whom we have previously patiently negotiated and restart the fruitless discussions that cannot promote disarmament in the slightest.

The West's Expression of Willingness to Participate in the Foreign Ministers' Meeting is Only to Raise Unreasonable Demands

It is obvious here that they hope to convene a meeting actually to raise their own conditions, their own negotiating program. And it is not difficult to imagine what kind of situation will form at the meeting because the Soviet Union cannot accept these conditions, because these conditions will not lead to disarmament in any way. Western countries will then seize the opportunity to accuse the Soviet Union of being unwilling to make concessions, of sabotaging the agreement, thereby confusing public opinion. Everyone judge, in this situation, can you expect such a foreign ministers' meeting to come to any beneficial results on this issue?

The Soviet Union, as before, sincerely hopes to promote an agreement on the disarmament issue and stop the "Cold War." For many years, the Soviet government has been striving to reach an agreement with Western countries, but due to the unwillingness of the ruling groups of these countries to reach an agreement, nothing has been achieved.

Therefore, the essence of the problem does not lie in the fact that ministerial-level negotiations have not been held in the past and that a ministerial-level meeting should be convened now, but in the fact that Western countries should abandon their dangerous policy of war preparation, vigorously inciting the "Cold War," and intensifying the arms race, so as to hold sincere negotiations that the Soviet government has consistently advocated. (Applause)

Comrade Representatives, after analyzing the process of disarmament negotiations over the years, as well as the attitudes and proposals of both sides, the Soviet government has come to the conclusion that in the current international situation of tense relations between countries, the realistic way to resolve the disarmament issue is to restore and strengthen mutual trust between countries. We must look for common starting points, and at the same time, where the current situation allows, we can take measures in disarmament, even if it is only the first step. If Western countries are now unwilling to reach an agreement with us on the issue of taking common disarmament measures, it will hinder the reaching of an agreement in terms of mutually undertaking moral responsibilities and taking measures one by one that help restore trust between countries and pave the way for resolving the entire disarmament issue.

The Soviet government believes that it is currently possible to achieve this specific step. The Soviet government has already put forward corresponding proposals in the letters of Comrade Bulganin, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, and in the note of the Soviet government to the governments of the member states of the United Nations. Let me briefly mention these suggestions again.

The Soviet government declared its willingness to stop all testing of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons from January 1, 1958, if the US and British governments are also willing to undertake this obligation. If the testing of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons can be stopped, the number of this type of weapon held by each country possessing such weapons can remain at the level of January 1, 1958. It can be seen that the Soviet Union does not want war, does not formulate plans to invade any country, and is willing to give up further improvements to this type of weapon. The US and British governments, which claim that they do not intend to invade anyone either, why are they unwilling to abandon further improvements to this type of weapon together with the Soviet Union in this situation?

The Soviet Union then suggested that the United States and the United Kingdom jointly abandon the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. This suggestion is easy to implement, because it does not require the establishment of complex international supervision for its implementation, nor does it require any material expenditure, but its great significance to the cause of peace is self-evident.

The Soviet Union and other member states of the Warsaw Pact have long suggested that the member states of the North Atlantic Alliance conclude a treaty of mutual non-aggression. Whether this issue, which can alleviate international tensions in many ways and consolidate European security, can be resolved currently depends on the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, and other member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Opponents of this suggestion sometimes point out that the idea of a treaty of mutual non-aggression seems to be ineffective. They cite Hitler's Germany tearing up such a treaty to prove this point. This argument is clearly untenable. Who can deny that Hitler's Germany, by violating treaties of mutual non-aggression with other countries, exposed itself before the whole world as a perfidious aggressor who violated its own international obligations. Didn't this promote Hitler's Germany's greater isolation in international politics and promote the solidarity of the anti-Hitler alliance? It is not the idea of a treaty of mutual non-aggression itself that is discredited, but the violators of this treaty. Therefore, one cannot help but ask: is it not because someone believes that the idea of a treaty of mutual non-aggression is inappropriate because this idea would seriously hinder some people from brewing aggressive plans at present?

The suggestion to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe deserves serious attention

The suggestion to establish a nuclear-weapon-free and hydrogen-weapon-free zone in Europe deserves serious attention, because there are completely realistic preconditions for realizing this suggestion. As everyone knows, the Polish government, with the support of Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic, took the initiative to put forward such a suggestion: the territories of these three countries can be included in the nuclear-weapon-free and hydrogen-weapon-free zone, if the West German government also does not deploy foreign nuclear weapons within West Germany, and West Germany itself does not produce such weapons.

The governments of Poland, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia agree to include the territories of their countries in this zone. Now it is up to the attitude of the fourth country in this region, the Federal Republic of Germany. As for the Soviet government, it fully supports the suggestion of the governments of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic on establishing a nuclear-weapon-free and hydrogen-weapon-free zone in Europe, and is prepared to hold corresponding negotiations with the US and British governments. The establishment of such a zone in Central Europe, including more than 100 million residents, will greatly change the situation in Europe.

The Soviet Union believes that all countries should undertake an obligation to stop war propaganda, which some Western countries are now carrying out every day through newspapers, radio stations, movies, television, and other means. War propaganda – this is a crime against peace, and no false pretext of so-called "freedom of speech" can cover up this crime. Is there a big difference between those who are clamoring today to drop atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs on some countries, who do not like the internal systems of these countries, and the Hitler bandits who sat in the dock of the international court eleven years ago and made the same clamors? The difference here is not great.

The Soviet Union Advocates Convening a Special Session of the UN General Assembly or an International Disarmament Conference

In view of the fact that the disarmament issue cannot remain in its current deadlock state, the Soviet government suggests that a special session of the United Nations General Assembly or an international disarmament conference be convened in the near future.

The Soviet government has long stated that convening a high-level meeting of representatives of capitalist and socialist countries would undoubtedly promote the prompt and positive resolution of these urgent issues.

Those who advocate continuing the policy of the arms race often use the pretext that the Soviet Union now occupies an advantage in the most modern weapons, and if this policy is abandoned, many countries, especially neutral countries, will think that Western countries, especially the United States, have admitted their weakness. They insist that abandoning the above-mentioned policy would affect the prestige of the United States and the entire North Atlantic Group.

The prestige of the United States and some of its partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is precisely being damaged by their current policy and approach, and the longer the time, the more deeply this is expressed. In this regard, it is best for the Americans themselves to talk about it. We are convinced that replacing the "position of strength" policy, replacing the policy of putting the world on the "brink of war," with another policy aimed at stopping the expansion of armaments, easing international tensions, and developing cooperation between countries, especially in terms of trade, would instead enhance the prestige of the United States and other countries that follow the US policy.

The Soviet Union and other socialist countries now and in the future will do everything possible to consolidate the cause of peace, strive to develop friendship and cooperation among the people of all countries, and still firmly, sincerely, and patiently strive to reach an agreement to end the arms race and save mankind from the threat of a devastating atomic war. In implementing this policy, our country relies on the rock-solid unity of our people, relies on our growing economic strength, relies on the unity of the entire socialist camp, and also relies on the growing peace forces around the world. (Stormy applause)

    在苏联最高苏维埃会议上
    葛罗米柯报告裁军问题
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科22日电：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯21日在苏联最高苏维埃会议上发了言。发言全文如下：
    代表同志们！
    我受苏联部长会议的委托，回答一些代表提出的关于各国讨论裁军问题的结果和在这一问题上达成协议的可能性的询问。
    尽管苏联和其他爱好和平国家不断地努力争取停止军备竞赛和消除新战争的威胁，但是裁军问题仍然没有得到实际解决，苏联政府对此非常关切。你们大家都知道，关于裁军问题的谈判在联合国内进行了十年，到今天还没有达成协议，而且现在又中断了。所以这样，是因为我们在裁军谈判中的主要对手美国、英国以及同它们一个鼻孔出气的法国，如事实所表明的，不愿在限制军备和限制核武器的积累及发展方面承担任何义务。让我们来看一下事实。
    美英法政府长久干着和裁军任务完全对立的勾当
    当联合国裁军委员会和小组委员会，有时是联合国大会，对裁军问题进行冗长的毫无结果的讨论的时候，美、英、法政府实际上却干着和裁军任务完全对立的勾当。
    美国和英国在谈判桌上装出探求裁军问题的协议的样子，实际上这些国家却拚命扩充军备，要求它们的北大西洋集团的伙伴把越来越多的军队交给北大西洋公约组织指挥，并且增加本来就十分庞大的军费。美国在英国和某些北大西洋公约组织军事集团成员国的支持下，拚命督促武装西德，要想让西德的经济力量和人力为北大西洋公约组织的军事计划服务。
    苏联政府遵循苏维埃国家外交政策的列宁主义原则，曾经向联合国提出不少旨在把裁军纳入现实道路的建议。你们知道，苏联政府建议实现完全禁止原子武器和氢武器，从各国军备中取缔这种武器，停止生产和销毁这种武器的储备。在苏联的建议中还规定大大削减武装部队人数、军备和军事预算。
    苏联政府仔细地研究了西方国家的建议，以便找出相接近的观点，得出西方国家和我们都能接受的东西。在很多情况下，苏联采纳了西方国家的建议。例如，关于规定大国武装部队人数限额问题。但是，这一切并没有得出什么结果。当苏联迁就西方国家的建议时，立刻又出现了新的障碍，因为美国、英国和法国政府又变卦了，放弃了他们昨天还坚持要求采纳的建议。
    同以往一样，美国和英国逃避解决裁军问题，把达成关于这个问题的协定同一些牵强附会的和无法执行的条件、特别是有关裁军监督的措施纠缠在一起。像禁止原子武器和氢武器、从军备中取缔这种武器、缩减军事开支和军事预算、撤除在别国领土上的军事基地、分别从北大西洋公约组织成员国和华沙条约缔约国撤退外国军队这样一些问题，在西方国家建议中根本没有提到。单单这一点就可以证明，这些国家的政府同促进裁军谈判的成功相距得多么远。
    此外，他们还人为地提出解决同裁军毫无关系的政治问题，如德国问题，作为就裁减武装力量达成协议的先决条件。甚至在像停止试验原子武器和氢武器这样一个比较简单的问题上，他们也把其他更为复杂得多的裁军问题（由于西方国家的立场目前还没有在这些问题上达成协议的可能）跟它纠缠在一起。
    西方国家一直想在联合国裁军组织中保持横霸势力
    应该指出的是，近年来裁军谈判的气氛也是十分不正常的。在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会（近三年来裁军谈判主要是在这里进行），跟苏联作对的是美国、英国、法国和加拿大这四个北大西洋集团成员国，凡是不符合这个军事集团的政策的一切建议，它们都加以抵制。结果，小组委员会在拟定裁军协定方面寸步不前，反而成了掩饰西方国家扩充军备的帷幕。
    美国和英国政府以及它们的北大西洋公约组织的某些伙伴利用联合国裁军组织来阻挠达成协议，同时还想造成一种似乎谈判有所进展和裁军问题协议即将达成的印象，自然，在这种情况下苏联政府不能不作出一定的结论。在最近一次联合国大会上，苏联政府建议成立一个由联合国全体会员国组成的裁军委员会。这个委员会的成立能够使所有这些国家，无论是大国还是小国，直接参加讨论各国人民所关切的问题，当然，仅此一端还不能解决问题，但是这种谈判的方式可以结束关起门来的秘密讨论，使人民有可能监督裁军谈判。
    真正重视各国人民的裁军要求，并寻求摆脱谈判僵局的出路的人难道能反对这个建议吗？不，不能。
    然而，西方国家，尤其是美国，却断然反对这个建议。
    在联合国大会上提出了另一个得到苏联政府赞同的建议。这就是阿尔巴尼亚所提出的、并且得到许多其他国家支持的建议，这个建议规定成立一个规模较小的裁军委员会，在这个委员会中至少应有半数的参加者是社会主义国家和奉行中立政策的国家。这个建议照理应该可以为一切国家所接受，因为奉行和平政策的国家的更加广泛的参加有助于裁军谈判取得成就。但是，西方国家也反对这个建议，企图在联合国的裁军组织中保持它们军事集团成员国的横霸势力。
    和从前一样，美国不惜对依赖于它的国家施加粗暴的压力，以阻止建立一个能够进行有效谈判的机构。
    虽然美国不得不同意对现在的委员会作一些扩大，但是却是这样扩大的：美国和它的军事集团的盟国仍然在这个委员会的新成员中保持绝大多数，使这个委员会二十五个参加国中有十六个是西方国家军事集团的成员国。
    美国和英国政府在联合国大会上强行通过的提案，企图预先规定应该在它们所规定的范围内以及在它们的条件下来进一步研究裁军问题，这样一个事实不能用别的理由来解释，而只能用这样的理由来解释，这就是损害和企图葬送裁军协定的主张。这种手腕从来没有成功过，今后也不会成功，而企图强使苏联和其他爱好和平的国家接受它们所不能接受的条件的这种提案是根本行不通的。鉴于这一切情况，苏联不得不声明，苏联不能参加这个委员会的工作，因为这个委员会的实际目的不过是继续阻碍裁军事业，欺骗人民而已。
    美国和英国政府总是力图损害苏联的安全利益来获得它们的军事优势，为此它们利用了众所周知的苏联关怀裁军、关怀巩固和平的意愿。此外，美国政府总是尽力阻挠人民中国同其他大国平等地参加裁军问题的讨论，这难道不是暴露了美国政府不愿实事求是地对待裁军问题吗？美国政府使自己处在一个尴尬的地位：西方国家提出的一些有关裁军措施的建议，根据这些国家的主张，这些建议也要涉及到中华人民共和国，可是美国政府却仍然不改变态度，仿佛世界上并没有伟大的中国存在一样。所以难怪越来越多的美国人开始指出美国对中国这种态度是荒谬的。
    美英在所谓原子优势破产后却继续叫嚣冷战
    长期以来，美国和英国一直打的算盘是，它们拥有所谓原子军备的优势。因此，它们就肯定地认为，既然优势在美国和英国方面，何必裁军呢。但是生活表明，这种如意算盘落空了。那种使这些国家的领导人在几乎整个战后时期为之陶醉的美梦现在破灭了。他们的美梦由于最近苏联的科学技术的伟大成就而烟消云散了。但是上述国家的领导集团是否从这里学到什么有益的教训呢？遗憾得很，暂时还没有学到什么。美国和英国的外交政策的决策人士目前认为：既然苏联在发展科学技术方面赶过了美国和英国，那末就应当首先赶上苏联，并且更大规模地，特别是在原子武器、氢武器和火箭生产方面，鼓吹军备竞赛。当然，这种做法只能符合大垄断资本的胃口，使它们在生产武器方面获得越来越多的利润，但是这种做法和人民的切身利益却是矛盾的。
    军备竞赛在目前比任何时期都更危险，因为最新式武器的破坏力是第二次世界大战中用过的武器所难以比拟的。何况在军备竞赛的驱使下军事技术不会停止不前。
    西方国家负责的领导人早就应该明白，裁军不是外交上的讨价还价，而是现代最迫切的任务，各国人民越来越坚决地要求迅速解决这个任务。不管怎样在联合国内玩弄表决的花招，不管怎样叫嚣继续“冷战”，也不能抹杀这个要求，不能把它从日程上去掉。社会主义国家的团结，各个捍卫和平利益的国家间日益巩固的互相谅解和合作，今天已经成了这样一种因素，这种因素就连最顽固的主张扩张军备的人也不能不加以考虑。目前的世界局势甚至已经同几个月以前不同了。苏联的地球卫星改善了我们星球上的政治气氛，它们正在进行着有益于和平、同时也有益于裁军的巨大工作。
    北大西洋集团首脑会议组织者没有如愿以偿
    北大西洋集团理事会这次会议的组织者花了不少的力气，企图把这次会议变成北大西洋公约组织成员国团结在备战和军备竞赛政策周围的一种示威。但是，北大西洋公约组织的会议表明，这种打算并没有如愿以偿，与会者不得不打破原来已经在华盛顿和伦敦制定好了的日程，而提出一些同这个军事集团的目的相差很远的问题来讨论，这一事实就已经说明了许多问题。只要提一提下面的情况就够了，即北大西洋公约组织会议的参加者被迫去研究同裁军谈判有关的一些问题，并且还讨论不久前苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁给北大西洋公约组织各国政府首脑的信中和给联合国所有会员国的照会中所陈述的苏联政府的建议。据外国报纸说，苏联好像无形地参加了北大西洋公约组织会议，影响着会议的整个进程。挪威、丹麦、德意志联邦共和国以及其他一些国家都主张仔细地研究苏联的建议。美国报纸“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”是这样评论会议的情况的：“现在在巴黎所发生的情况是对杜勒斯只要是苏联提出的建议就加以拒绝的这种习惯的反抗，这种反抗的规模还不清楚”。
    在欧洲各国境内建立美国的火箭发射基地网和建立这些火箭用的核弹头的储存库的计划遭到严重的反抗。挪威首相基哈德森说，挪威将不允许在本国境内建立原子武器库或设置中程弹道火箭发射台。丹麦首相汉森也以同样的口吻代表丹麦做了声明。苏联政府对上述斯堪的纳维亚国家领导人对局势所做的清醒的估计给予应有评价。
    西德居民由于美国计划把西德变成储存原子武器和氢武器的场所而深感不安，这种情绪对德意志联邦共和国政府在北大西洋公约组织会议上的立场也有所影响。联邦总理阿登纳不得不作这样的一种表示，即西德将不会匆忙地决定关于在本国的领土上建立美国火箭发射基地的问题。德意志联邦共和国政府关于美国火箭基地问题的声明可以被认为是比较明智地考虑西德利益的一种趋向，但是，这个声明同阿登纳坚决要求供给西德联邦国防军以各种武器和使西德参加包括火箭在内的现代化武器生产方面的研究工作这种行动，是不相协调的。
    不能不看到，西德的某些人丝毫也没有从过去的战争中得到教训，而却窥伺着适当的时机，企图把西德再一次推上战争的道路，如果原子武器一旦落入这些人的手中，那就可能会造成极严重的后果。下面的事实就说明了这一点：今天已经有西德的某些显要人士恬不知耻地说他们不同意欧洲某些国家的现有国界。以原子武器武装西德军队的这种措施难道会不引起欧洲各国间的危险的原子军备竞赛吗？
    要求停止军备竞赛的趋向日益强烈地显示出来
    不过，整个事态的发展表明，最近北大西洋公约组织会议的结果也在一定程度上表明，在国际关系中越来越强烈地显示出要求保证各国和平共处的条件和停止军备竞赛的趋向。我们兴奋地看到，不久前苏联政府向八十三个国家的政府发出的呼吁书和苏联政府所提出的关于巩固和平的道路的建议在各地，其中也包括在北大西洋公约组织各国的广大社会人士中，获得了如何广泛的良好反应和理解。难道这不是又一次有力地证明共产党及其中央委员会所确定的苏维埃国家的外交政策是符合人类绝大多数的期望吗？（鼓掌）这个政策获得了昨天还为战争宣传所迷惑的亿万人的支持。东方和西方的亿万人们正以期望和确信的眼光注视着始终坚决地维护伟大的国际和平事业的苏联。
    在刚公布的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议参加者的公报中有一段话表示愿意参加裁军问题外长会议。不难看出，公报中插入这样一段话是扩充军备和“冷战”的鼓吹者处境困难的结果。美国国务卿（这一段话很容易辨出是他执笔的）不得不加上外表上宽慰人心的语调，而实际上是要迷惑真正希望停止军备竞赛和“冷战”的各国人民。谁都清楚地知道，自从联合国在美国粗暴压力下通过一项决议赞同西方国家对裁军的立场，也就是赞同根本不想裁军和使裁军谈判陷入僵局的立场，到现在还不到一个月。现在实际上又有人建议我们再一次坐下来同我们以前耐心与之谈判的北大西洋公约组织那些成员国重新开始毫无结果的、丝毫不能推动裁军的讨论。
    西方表示愿意参加外长会议只是为了提出无理要求
    这里显然可以看出，他们希望召开会议实际上是为了提出自己的条件、自己的谈判纲领。而苏联不能接受这些条件，因为这些条件不会在任何程度上导致裁军，这就不难设想在会上会形成怎样一种局面。西方国家就会乘机责难苏联不肯让步，责难苏联破坏协议，从而迷惑舆论。大家判断一下，在这种情况下能够期望这种外长会议就这一问题得出什么有益的结果吗？
    苏联同以前一样，真诚地希望促进在裁军问题上达成协议，停止
  “冷战”。许多年来，苏联政府一直努力争取同西方国家达成协议，但是由于这些国家的统治集团不愿达成协议，以致一无所成。
    因此，问题的实质并不在于过去没有举行部长级谈判而现在应该召开部长级会议，而在于西方国家应该放弃它们所实行的备战、大肆煽动“冷战”以及加紧军备竞赛的危险方针，从而举行苏联政府所一贯主张的真诚谈判。（掌声）
    代表同志们，苏联政府分析了多年来裁军谈判的过程以及双方的态度和建议以后，得出一个结论，即在目前各国之间存在着紧张关系的国际情况下，解决裁军问题的现实道路是恢复和加强国与国间的互相信任。必须寻找共同的出发点，同时在当前情况允许的地方、可以在裁军方面作出措施，那怕是第一步也好。如果现在西方国家不愿就采取共同裁军措施问题同我们达成协议，那就会妨碍在互相承担道义责任以及在一个个地采取有助于恢复各国间的信任和为解决整个裁军问题扫清道路的措施方面达成协议。
    苏联政府认为，目前有可能实现这种具体步骤。苏联政府在苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁同志的信件中和苏联政府给联合国各会员国政府的照会中已经提出了相应的建议。我再简短地提一提这些建议。
    苏联政府声明愿意从1958年1月1日起停止原子武器和氢武器的一切试验，如果美国和英国政府也愿意承担这种义务的话。如果能够停止原子武器和氢武器的试验，就能够使拥有这类武器的每个国家的这种类型的武器配备停留在1958年1月1日的状况。可见苏联不愿意战争，不制订侵犯任何国家的计划，它愿意放弃进一步改进这类武器。口口声声说也不打算侵犯任何人的美国和英国政府，为什么在这种情况下却不愿意同苏联一道放弃进一步改进这种武器呢？
    苏联接着又建议美国和英国共同放弃使用原子武器和氢武器。这一建议是容易实现的，因为它既不需要对它的执行情况建立复杂的国际监督，也不需要任何物质耗费，而它对和平事业的重大意义却是不言而喻的。
    苏联和华沙条约的其他成员国早就建议北大西洋联盟的成员国缔结互不侵犯条约。这个能在多方面缓和国际紧张局势和巩固欧洲安全的问题能否解决，目前取决于美国、英国、法国、德意志联邦共和国和北大西洋公约组织其他成员国的政府。
    这个建议的反对者有时候指出，似乎互不侵犯条约的主张是不管用的。他们引用希特勒德国撕毁这种条约来证明这一点。这种论断显然是站不住脚的。有谁能否认，希特勒德国破坏了同其他国家的互不侵犯条约、就在全世界面前暴露出它是一个背信弃义的破坏自己的国际义务的侵略者。难道这没有促进希特勒德国在国际政治上更加孤立和促进反希特勒联盟力量的团结吗？声名败坏的并不是互不侵犯条约主张的本身，而是这种条约的破坏者。因此，不禁要问：有人认为互不侵犯条约的主张不合适，难道不是因为这种主张在目前会严重地妨碍一些人酝酿侵略计划么？
    在欧洲建立无原子武器地区的建议值得认真注意
    关于在欧洲建立无原子武器和氢武器地区的建议值得认真注意，因为有着实现这个建议完全现实的前提。大家知道，波兰政府在捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国的支持下，主动提出了这样一个建议：这三个国家的领土可以列入无原子武器和氢武器地区，如果西德政府方面也不在西德境内配置外国的核武器、并且西德本国也不生产这种武器的话。
    波兰、德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克三国政府同意把它们国家的领土列入这个地区。现在要看这个地区的第四个国家德意志联邦共和国的态度了。至于苏联政府，它完全支持波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国三国政府关于在欧洲建立无原子武器和氢武器地区的建议，并且准备同美国和英国政府举行相应的谈判。在欧洲中部建立一个包括一亿多居民的这种地区，将在很大程度上改变欧洲的局势。
    苏联认为，各国应该承担一项停止战争宣传的义务，而某些西方国家现在天天通过报刊、电台、电影、电视等手段进行战争宣传。战争宣传——这是对和平的罪行，任何所谓“言论自由”的虚伪借口都掩饰不了这种罪行。今天有些人叫嚣要把原子弹和氢弹投到某些国家，他们不喜欢这些国家的内部制度，而十一年前坐在国际法庭的被告席的希特勒匪徒也曾经发出同样叫嚣，这两者之间难道有很大的差别吗？这里的差别是不大的。
    苏联主张召开联大特别会议或国际性裁军会议
    鉴于不能使裁军问题停留在目前的僵局状态，苏联政府建议，在最近时期内召开联合国大会特别会议或者国际性裁军代表会议。
    召开资本主义国家和社会主义国家代表的高级会议无疑地会促进尽速地积极解决这些迫切的问题，这一点苏联政府早就声明过了。
    拥护继续进行军备竞赛政策的人常常借口现在苏联在最现代化的武器方面占据优势，如果放弃这种政策，许多国家、首先是中立国家，就会认为西方国家、特别是美国承认了自己的软弱。他们硬说，放弃上述政策会影响美国和整个北大西洋集团的威信。
    美国和它的北大西洋公约组织的某些伙伴的威信正是被他们现行的这种政策方针所损害了，而且时间愈久，这一点就愈深刻地表现出来。在这方面最好是由美国人自己来谈。我们确信，用另外一种旨在停止扩充军备、缓和国际紧张局势和发展各国间的合作、首先是贸易方面的合作的政策去代替“实力地位”政策，代替把世界置于“战争边缘”的政策，这反而会提高美国以及追随美国政策的其他国家的威信。
    苏联以及其他社会主义国家现在和将来都尽一切可能去巩固和平事业，尽力发展各国人民间的友谊与合作，并且仍然坚决、诚恳和耐心地争取达成协议以结束军备竞赛，使人类免除毁灭性的原子战争的威胁。我们国家在执行这一政策的时候，依靠我国人民磐石般的团结，依靠我们日益增长的经济实力，依靠整个社会主义阵营的团结，也依靠全世界日益增强的和平力量。（暴风雨般的掌声）
