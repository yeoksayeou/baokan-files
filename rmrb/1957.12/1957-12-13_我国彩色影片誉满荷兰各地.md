Our country's color stage documentary "Acrobatic Performance in the Square" has been officially released in the Netherlands, including The Hague, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Utrecht, since June of this year. The screenings have been unprecedentedly popular. In just eight days of screenings, the audience has reached more than 220,000 people. This fact proves that the Dutch people are very welcoming to Chinese films. According to the head of the Excelsior Film Company, the Dutch distributor of Chinese films, following "Acrobatic Performance in the Square," Chinese color short films such as "Guilin Landscape" and "Hibiscus" will be successively screened in the Netherlands.
