Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 16th: Kadar said at the year-end accounting meeting of the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Hungarian border city of Polgár on the 13th that this year the grain yield per unit area of Hungarian agricultural production cooperatives is generally 30% higher than that of individual farmers, and in some places it is one-third higher.

At the meeting, Kadar emphasized that thanks to good labor and weather conditions, Hungary's agricultural production has achieved considerable success this year. He also mentioned that state-owned farms had been poorly managed in the past, but this year is their best year ever.

He also said that this year, the government has solved the problem of agricultural product procurement, and according to the Party's policy, the procurement prices are reasonable, while ensuring the food supply to the cities. Both collective farmers and individual farmers have fulfilled their obligations to pay taxes to the state this year.

When talking about the road to cooperativization, Kadar pointed out that whether or not to join agricultural production cooperatives is an important issue for farmers. When the counter-revolutionaries raised the question of capitalism versus people's democracy and socialism to the farmers last October, the vast majority of farmers said: "I don't want the old world, I want people's democracy." This is the true expression of the farmers. Therefore, the worker-peasant alliance has been strengthened. He also said that those who withdrew from the cooperatives during the counter-revolutionary riots last year should be distinguished between enemies and our own people. For our own people, we should patiently help them return to the correct path.

Kadar pointed out that taking the socialist road is the correct way to develop the agricultural economy. The Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party hopes that both cooperatives and individual farmers can live happily, but individual farmers should think about which path to take. Kadar said that we now want to develop the entire agricultural economy, to develop state-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and individual agricultural economies. There are still many things that can be done in this regard, such as reducing production costs, which is a very important thing.

Kadar pointed out that cooperatives must develop, and first of all, they must improve their management. Under the leadership of the Party organization, agricultural machinery stations, local people's councils, and the People's Front should also assist agricultural production cooperatives, but any coercion should be avoided.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 16th: The income of Hungary's agricultural production cooperatives this year has greatly exceeded that of last year. The income of seven or eight hundred agricultural cooperatives (about 30% of the total number of agricultural cooperatives in the country) has caught up with or exceeded the level of ordinary middle peasants. In the past, the average income of members of Hungarian agricultural cooperatives was 25 to 30 forints (Hungarian currency) per labor day, and this year the average figure has reached 40 to 42 forints.

　　卡达尔谈农业合作化
    农业社生产增长优越性显著  匈牙利的工农联盟较前加强
    据新华社布达佩斯16日电　卡达尔13日在匈牙利边境城市波尔契红星农业生产合作社年终结账社员大会上说，今年匈牙利农业生产合作社的谷物单位面积产量一般比个体农民高30％，有的地方高三分之一。
    卡达尔在这次会上强调指出，由于良好的劳动以及气候的关系，今年匈牙利的农业生产获得了可观的成绩。他还谈到，国营农场过去经营不善，而今年是成绩最好的一年。
    他又说，今年，政府解决了农产品收购的问题，根据党的政策作到了收购价格合理，同时保证了城市的粮食供应。集体农民和个体农民今年都已经完成了向国家交税的义务。
    卡达尔在谈到合作化道路时指出，是否参加农业生产合作社对农民来说是个重要问题。当去年十月间反革命向农民提出是要资本主义还是要人民民主和社会主义的问题时，绝大多数农民说：“我不要旧世界，我要人民民主。”这是农民们的真正表示。因此，工农联盟加强了。他又说，对那些在去年反革命暴乱期间退社的人应当区别他们是敌人还是自己人。对于自己人，应当耐心地帮助他们回到正确的道路上来。
    卡达尔指出，走社会主义道路是发展农业经济的正确道路。社会主义工人党中央希望合作社和个体农民都过得幸福，但是个体农民应该想想走什么道路好。卡达尔说，我们现在要发展整个农业经济，要发展国营农场、农业生产合作社和个体农业经济。在这方面还有很多事情可以作，例如降低生产成本就是一件很重要的事。
    卡达尔指出，合作社一定要发展，首先要改善经营。在党组织领导下，农业机器站、地方人民会议、人民阵线等也应当协助农业生产合作社，但是应当避免任何强迫命令。
    据新华社布达佩斯16日电　匈牙利的农业生产合作社今年的收入大大超过了去年。有七、八百个农业合作社（约占全国农业合作社总数的30％）的社员收入已经赶上或超过了一般中农的水平。过去，匈牙利农业合作社社员平均每个劳动日的收入是二十五到三十福林（匈币），今年这个平均数字达到了四十到四十二福林。
