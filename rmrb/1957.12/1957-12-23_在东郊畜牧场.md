    At the East Suburb Livestock Farm
    Zou Difan
    Speech on the Tractor
    In the square of the livestock farm,
    The chairman of the labor union gives a speech on the tractor:
    "Welcome comrades to labor,
    Your labor is a good example for us.
    "Let me introduce this livestock farm,
    Here we have two thousand head of cattle,
    Ten thousand mu of land and chickens, ducks, and sheep."
    The wind blows on his face,
    The sun shines on his face,
    He smiles:
    "We want to turn the livestock farm into a zoo and garden,
    We plan to raise otters,
    Vegetables in ridges, flowers and fruits in rows...
    "Comrades, welcome you to labor,
    This livestock farm has your strength in it.
    When milk is delivered to the milk bottle box in the alleyway,
    When eggs are delivered to the hospital beds,
    Mothers thank you in the morning,
    Nurses thank you in the evening,
    Vegetables and apples preserve your strength."
    We have labored so little,
    We can't help but lower our heads and ponder,
    Are these words a bit of an exaggeration?
    Oh, this is the greatest humility of agricultural workers,
    They don't even think about how much strength they contribute!
    Digging a Ditch at the Edge of the Field
    You carry the dirt basket, I hold the iron shovel,
    Digging a ditch at the edge of the field.
    Here we will plant oats, plant alfalfa,
    A small canal will flow from here.
    A small canal will flow from here,
    No sailboats sail on this small canal,
    Nor does a fisherman steer a small boat,
    It's just a ditch at the edge of the field.
    But this is the granary for the cattle!
    This small canal flows into a milk road.
    Let the children happily blow bubbles,
    Just use the clear water flowing from this ditch.
    Come, let's dig a ditch at the edge of the field,
    Shoulders rubbed raw, palms calloused,
    It's just because we've been standing by for too long.
    Come, dig a ditch at the edge of the field,
    Happiness and joy seem to flow right here.
    Dream on the Wheat Straw
    During the lunch break,
    We lie on the wheat straw and fall asleep,
    The wheat straw crackles under our weight,
    We dream of gurgling water,
    Flowing into the ditch at the edge of the field.
    Dreaming of swaying wheat ears,
    Dreaming of girls wearing calico headscarves walking past the edge of the field,
    Dreaming of oxcarts dragging wheat stalks across the yellow earth road...
    Until the bell rings and wakes us from our dreams.
    We walk onto the fields again.
    A young man confides in me like this:
    "I have had all kinds of dreams -
    Dreaming of becoming an architect,
    Drawing a blueprint for a desert city.
    Dreaming of becoming a navigator,
    Seagulls and white waves send me to the end of the world.
    Dreaming of becoming a scientist,
    Fingers capturing lightning, heart holding the universe...
    "Now I dream of becoming a farmer,
    Driving a tractor, holding a sickle and hoe in my hand,
    Labor has changed my dreams,
    I want my youth to make the rapeseed flowers yellow and the wheat seedlings beautiful..."

    在东郊畜牧场
    邹荻帆
    拖拉机上的讲话
    在畜牧场的广场上，
    工会主席在拖拉机上把话讲：
    “欢迎同志们来劳动，
    你们的劳动给我们好榜样。
    “让我来介绍这畜牧场，
    这里有两千头牛，
    有一万亩地和鸡鸭羊。”
    风吹着他的脸庞，
    太阳照着他的脸庞，
    他笑一笑：
    “我们要把畜牧场变成动物园和花园，
    我们计划养水獭，
    蔬菜成畦，花果成行……
    “同志们，欢迎你们来劳动，
    这畜牧场是你们出了力量。
    当牛奶送到胡同人家的奶瓶箱，
    当鸡蛋送到医院的病床上，
    母亲们在清晨感谢你，
    护士们在傍晚感谢你，
    蔬菜苹果上保藏着你们的力量。”
    我们劳动得这么少呀，
    我们不由地低头思量，
    这些话是不是有些夸张？
    哦，这是农业工人最大的谦虚，
    他们一点不想到他们贡献了多少力量！
    挖出一条垅头沟
    你抬土筐，我拿铁锹，
    挖出一条垅头沟。
    这儿要种燕麦、种苜蓿，
    一条小运河就从这儿流。
    一条小运河就从这儿流，
    这小运河上不走风帆，
    也没有渔翁驾扁舟，
    只是一条垅头沟。
    可这儿是牧牛的粮食仓呀！
    这小运河流成一条牛奶路。
    让孩子们快乐地吹泡泡，
    就用这沟里的清水流。
    来，我们来挖出一条垅头沟，
    肩膀磨肿，手掌磨粗，
    就是因为袖手旁观太长久。
    来，挖出一条垅头沟，
    幸福和愉快仿佛就在这儿流。
    麦草上的梦
    午休的时候，
    我们躺在麦草上睡熟，
    麦草被压得发响，
    我们梦到潺潺的水流，
    流到垅头沟。
    梦着麦穗在摇摆，
    梦着披印花布头巾的姑娘走过垅头，
    梦着牛车拖着麦簇辗过黄土路……
    到铃声摇醒我们的梦。
    我们又走上田亩。
    一个少年对我这样倾诉：
    “我有过各式各样的梦想——
    梦想做一个建筑师，
    画出一座沙漠城的蓝图。
    梦想做一个航海员，
    海鸥和白浪送我到天尽头。
    梦想做一个科学家，
    手指擒住雷电，心胸藏着宇宙……
    “现在我梦想做一个农民，
    驾着拖拉机，手上拿着镰和锄，
    劳动改变了我的梦想，
    我的青春要让菜花黄、麦苗秀……”
