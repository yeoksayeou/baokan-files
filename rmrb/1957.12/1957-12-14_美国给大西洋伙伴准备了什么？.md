What Has the United States Prepared for its Atlantic Partners?
	Xi Linsheng
    The highest-level meeting of the North Atlantic Group is about to convene in Paris. This meeting, decided upon by Eisenhower and Macmillan during their Washington talks in late October, is being held under these new circumstances: on the one hand, the unity of the socialist camp is growing stronger, and socialist countries have achieved great successes in peaceful construction, especially the successful launch of artificial satellites by the Soviet Union, which has made the prestige of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union unprecedented; on the other hand, the United States has proven to be lagging behind the Soviet Union in certain important aspects of science and industry, which has shattered the myth of American "superiority", greatly reduced the credibility of the United States within the imperialist camp, and increased the centrifugal tendencies of the United States' allies.
    To cope with this new situation, Washington had to accept the idea of "mutual dependence" in the US-British talks, attempting to repair the "position of strength" policy and salvage the fragmented situation of the Western bloc.
    Western news agencies have already revealed a lot of information about this much-publicized plan for "mutual dependence." Summarized, the main contents are as follows:
    First, lift restrictions on West Germany's manufacturing and use of missiles, supply West Germany with nuclear weapons, further transform West Germany into a base for a new war, and enable it to play a greater role in the arms expansion and war preparation activities of the Western bloc.
    Second, connect the North Atlantic Group, the Baghdad Pact, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Pan-American Union into a global aggressive military system.
    Third, set up American missile bases on the territory of North Atlantic Group countries near the Soviet border, with the United States controlling the nuclear warheads.
    Fourth, store American nuclear weapons in Europe, with the United States maintaining control.
    Fifth, establish some form of scientific "cooperation" to utilize the scientific talents of member states and serve the strategic purposes of the North Atlantic Treaty more effectively.
    Sixth, implement a division of labor in the production of nuclear and conventional weapons. The United States takes on the production of the most important strategic nuclear weapons, such as intercontinental missiles; Britain produces tactical nuclear weapons and intermediate-range missiles; and France and West Germany are engaged in the production of short-range and medium-range missiles. In terms of conventional armaments, the main strategic air force is the responsibility of the United States; Britain focuses on manufacturing medium-range nuclear bombers; France manufactures fighter jets; and it is also stipulated that the air forces of the Netherlands and Belgium, and the navies of Norway and Denmark, should be merged.
    It is not difficult to see that, contrary to the "establishment of a just peace" touted in the US-British summit communiqué, the United States' "new policy" is first and foremost a plan to incite a larger-scale nuclear arms race and intensify international tensions.
    The United States' plan first encouraged the German militarists who had launched two world wars. The mouthpiece of the West German militarists, the "Münchner Merkur," has already shouted, "Take action, take action quickly!"
    The United States' plan to store nuclear weapons and set up American missile bases on European territory will undoubtedly make relations between East and West more tense. Because these weapons are in the hands of American generals who constantly clamor for "attacking the Soviet Union from all directions," the situation becomes even more explosive.
    The United States' plan to link various aggressive blocs will make it possible for each participating country to be dragged into various conflicts unrelated to them at any time for the benefit of the United States, and to rapidly expand the conflicts.
    The United States' plan not only brings serious dangers to Western European countries, but is also a way to strengthen its control over other countries. The United States is using the banner of "mutual dependence" as a trick. So-called "mutual dependence" actually makes other countries more definitively dependent on the United States. With strategic nuclear weapons and intercontinental missiles monopolized by the United States, other countries are strategically subordinate to the United States. The United States can decide on its own to wage war and use nuclear weapons and missile bases in these countries, and these countries cannot have a veto right over this, which is tantamount to handing over the fate of these countries to the American military. Other countries have to provide the United States with nuclear weapons storage bases, missile launch sites, and cannon fodder. In short, they hand over their sovereignty and risk destruction, but the United States does not bear any constraints. This kind of "mutual dependence" is, at best, a relationship of "you carry me, I ride you." Although the United States, together with Britain, formulated the "mutual dependence" plan, Western European countries (especially France) are worried that the United States and Britain will establish a "league within a league" to control other countries in the North Atlantic Group. In fact, the United States is also not enthusiastic about the so-called "league within a league."
    From an economic point of view, the United States' new plan requires its "allies" to engage in an arms race with greater force, which will inevitably greatly increase the already difficult-to-cope-with military burden of these countries, and make the already extremely unstable economy of these countries subject to greater impact. Large-scale arms expansion and war preparation help the bellicose monopoly capital groups to obtain more profits, but for the broad masses of people in the North Atlantic Group countries, especially the people of the North Atlantic European member states who are suffering from the serious threat of inflation, it means that life is further moving towards poverty and destitution.
    It can be seen that the so-called "mutual dependence" policy formulated by the United States in cooperation with Britain is to push the countries of the North Atlantic Group into an abyss full of disasters and misfortunes. This is completely contrary to the will and interests of the people of these countries.
    Precisely because of this, when this plan was initially revealed, it aroused widespread dissatisfaction in Western European countries. The acute degree of contradictions within the North Atlantic Group has already made some Western newspaper commentators make bleak predictions about the prospects of the meeting.
    The US ruling group places great hope on this summit meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Eisenhower, regardless of his illness, is still struggling to attend the Paris meeting in person. However, from the reaction of Western European public opinion to the US plan, it can be seen that the Western European public is becoming more and more sensitive to the enslaving and war-adventurous nature of the US plan, and even if Eisenhower has great "prestige," it will be difficult to make these countries accept such a plan.

### 美国给大西洋伙伴准备了什么？

　　美国给大西洋伙伴准备了什么？
　　席林生
    北大西洋集团的最高级会议快要在巴黎开会了。这个由艾森豪威尔同麦克米伦在10月下旬华盛顿会谈中决定召开的会议，是在这样的新形势下举行的：一方面，社会主义阵营各国的团结日益增强，社会主义各国在和平建设中取得伟大的成就，特别是苏联发射人造卫星成功，这一切使得以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威望空前增长；另一方面，美国在科学和工业的某些重要方面证明已落后于苏联，这就粉碎了关于美国“优势”的神话，使得美国在帝国主义阵营中的威信大大降低，增长了美国各盟国的离心倾向。
    为了应付这种新形势，华盛顿不得不在美英会谈中接受“互相依赖”的提法，企图修补“实力地位”政策，收拾西方集团支离破碎的局面。
    关于这项大事宣扬的“互相依赖”的计划，西方通讯社已经透露了不少消息。综合起来有这样一些主要的内容：
    一，取消对西德制造和使用导弹的限制，供给西德核武器，进一步变西德为新战争的基地，使它在西方集团的扩军备战活动中发挥更大作用。
    二，把北大西洋集团、巴格达集团、东南亚集团和泛美联盟连成一个全球性的侵略性军事体系。
    三，在靠近苏联边境的北大西洋集团国家领土上设置美国的导弹基地，由美国掌握核弹头。
    四，在欧洲贮存美国的核武器，由美国保持控制。
    五，成立某种形式的科学“合作”，以便利用各成员国的科学人才，更多地服务于北大西洋公约的战略目的。
    六，在生产核武器和常规武器方面实行分工。美国包办最重要的战略核武器如洲际导弹的生产；英国生产战术性原子武器和中程导弹；法国和西德从事于短程和中程导弹的生产。在常规军备上，主要的战略空军归美国负责；英国集中制造中程核轰炸机；法国则制造战斗机；此外还规定合并荷兰和比利时的空军及挪威和丹麦的海军。
    不难看出，和美英首脑会议公报所标榜的“建立正义的和平”相反，美国的这项“新政策”首先是一项煽起更大规模核子军备竞赛、加剧国际紧张局势的计划。
    美国的这项计划首先鼓励了曾经发动两次世界大战的德国军国主义者。西德军国主义者的喉舌“慕尼黑信使报”已经在大叫“行动起来，尽速行动起来！”
    美国准备在欧洲领土上贮存核武器和设置美国导弹基地，无疑会使东西方之间的关系更加紧张。由于这些武器掌握在那些不断叫嚣“从各个方向进攻苏联”的美国将军手里，就使得局势更具有爆炸性。
    美国的把各种侵略集团连在一起的计划，则将使各个参加国随时可能为了美国的利益而被拖进与它们毫不相干的各种冲突里，并使冲突迅速扩大。
    美国这个计划不只是给西欧国家带来严重的危险，而且也是加强它对其他国家的控制的一种办法。美国打起“互相依赖”的招牌，只是一个花招。所谓“互相依赖”，实际上是使其他国家更加确定地依赖美国。战略核武器和洲际导弹由美国垄断，其他国家就在战略上处于从属美国的地位。美国可以自行决定进行战争以及使用核武器和在这些国家的导弹基地，而这些国家对此不能有否决权，这就等于把这些国家的命运交在美国军人手中。其他国家要为美国提供核武器储藏基地，提供导弹发射场，提供炮灰，总之，交出主权又冒毁灭危险，但是美国却不承受任何约束。这种“互相依赖”，说得好一点也不过是“你来驮我，我来骑你”的关系。尽管美国伙同英国一起制定了“互相依赖”计划，西欧大陆国家（特别是法国）却担心美英要建立“联盟中的联盟”来控制北大西洋集团的其他国家。而实际上，美国对所谓“联盟中的联盟”也是并不热心的。
    从经济后果来说，美国的新计划要求它的“盟国”以更多力量从事军备竞赛，这不可避免地会大大加重这些国家早已难于应付的军备负担，使得这些国家已经极不稳定的经济受到更大的冲击。大规模扩军备战有助于好战的垄断资本集团获得更多的利润，但是对于北大西洋集团国家的广大人民，特别是正在遭受通货膨胀的严重威胁的北大西洋欧洲成员国的人民，却意味着生活进一步走向贫困和穷苦。
    由此可见，美国在英国协同下制定的所谓“互相依赖”政策，是要把北大西洋集团各国推进一个充满灾难和不幸的深渊。这是完全违反这些国家人民的意志和利益的。
    正因为如此，在这个计划初步透露的时候，就在西欧各国引起广泛的不满的反应。北大西洋集团内部矛盾尖锐的程度，已经使某些西方报纸评论员对会议的前景作了黯淡的预测。
    美国统治集团对这次北大西洋公约首脑会议是寄予了极大的希望的。艾森豪威尔顾不得病魔缠身，仍然挣扎着要亲自出席巴黎会议。但是，从西欧国家舆论对美国计划的反应可以看出，西欧国家公众对于美国计划的奴役性质和战争冒险的性质愈来愈敏感，即使艾森豪威尔有多大的“声望”，要使这些国家接受这样一个计划，也是困难的。
