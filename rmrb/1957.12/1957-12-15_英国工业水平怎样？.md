London Dispatch:

What is the Level of British Industry?
By Pan Fei and Su Lan, our Correspondents

"In fifteen years, the Soviet Union's industry and agriculture may catch up with or surpass the United States in the output of the most important products, and we should strive to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products during the same period." - Liu Shaoqi

Opening a map of Britain, one can see city after city closely arranged on the small British Isles. And each city is often a huge industrial hub. London concentrates electrical, chemical, and other industrial enterprises, and its output value accounts for 29% of the total industrial output value of the United Kingdom. Around Birmingham, there are dense mines and metallurgical factories; Coventry is the center of the automobile and aviation industries; Glasgow is a famous shipbuilding industrial base; and around Manchester, there are densely packed textile factories...

Although Britain's position as an industrial nation has declined since the First World War, it must be admitted that it is still a country with a relatively high level of industry. The total number of employed people in the UK, including civil servants, is 22,890,000, but the number of people working in the industrial sector is 11,930,000, accounting for more than half.

Since we put forward the slogan "Catch up with Britain in fifteen years," the London press has remained silent on this matter. Only a very small number of newspapers published brief reports in inconspicuous positions. However, even people in the British ruling group cannot help but be surprised by the heroic spirit of the Chinese people.

In this dispatch, we would like to provide some figures and information to illustrate the current level of British industry.

According to official statistics, the output of several major industrial products in the UK in 1956 was:
Steel: 20.66 million tons
Iron: 13.17 million tons
Coal: 222.7 million tons
Oil: 150,000 tons (1955 production)
Electricity: 88.5 billion kilowatt-hours
Cotton cloth: 1.612 billion yards

Britain's steel production ranks third in the capitalist world. As early as 1895, its steel production was close to our current level, at 4.26 million tons, and then increased year by year. Iron production is less because Britain is an old industrialized country and has a large amount of scrap iron that can be recycled. Since the Second World War, due to the continued expansion of armaments and the renewal of equipment destroyed during the war, the demand for metals has increased, and steel production has also increased rapidly. According to the British authorities' plan, by 1962, Britain's annual steel production will reach 28 million tons.

The steel industry is one of the industries with a high level of technology in British industry. According to statistics, iron produced by modern factories rebuilt and newly built after the war accounts for 24% of total iron production; steel accounts for 21%.

In the development of British industry, a prominent fact is the rapid growth of the metal manufacturing industry, especially the automobile manufacturing and light metal industries. From 1935 to 1948, metal manufacturing increased by 208%; in 1954, the production of metal products, machinery, and vehicles increased by 37% compared with 1948. In 1955, the output of various locomotives in the UK was 1,229; various automobiles were 1,270,090; and machine tools were 150,000 tons.

In terms of electricity production, the development in recent years has also been quite rapid. Britain has limited water resources, so it mainly uses thermal power generation. The first atomic energy power station started generating electricity in 1956, with a power generation capacity of 92,000 kilowatts.

The development of British industry is very uneven. Steel, chemical, automobile and other industrial sectors are called new industries in Britain, while coal mining and textile industries are called old industries. The former has newer technology and equipment and develops faster, while the latter has been in a state of depression for decades.

The British coal mining industry has existed for more than 700 years. In the half century before the First World War, coal production increased more than threefold, reaching a peak of more than 287 million tons per year in 1913. As a result, British coal occupied the world market, accounting for about 55% of the world's total coal exports. However, since 1913, this industry has gradually declined. It is experiencing a long-term crisis. This decline is caused by the following reasons: first, labor shortage; second, backward technology and equipment; third, the increase in coal, oil, and electricity production in other countries has led to a decrease in British coal exports. Although the British authorities nationalized the coal mines, this was only used to enrich private monopoly organizations, because after "nationalizing" the old mines, huge compensation fees were paid to the old mine owners, while the situation of the coal mines themselves did not improve, and working conditions deteriorated severely (in 1952 alone, one out of every three workers in the British coal mining industry suffered personal accidents). Until 1955, the production of coal in the UK was only 221 million tons, which was not only far behind the level of 1913, but also not as good as the level of 1938. It is said that Britain already has a new "development plan": to strive to reach an annual output of 250 million tons of coal by 1965.

Like the coal mining industry, the textile industry is also in a state of rapid decline. The current production of cotton cloth is less than one-half of that in 1937. In the years since 1951, the production of cotton cloth has decreased almost year by year.

British industry has developed through a long road. If calculated from the day the bourgeois republic was established, it has been 308 years; if calculated from the beginning of the industrial revolution in Britain, it has been more than 200 years. Compared with other capitalist countries in Western Europe, the level of British industry cannot be considered low, and the speed of development cannot be considered slow. On the contrary, before the First World War, Britain had always enjoyed the title of "world factory." However, if compared with the development speed of socialist countries' industries, it cannot be mentioned in the same breath. In the full fifty years from 1890 to 1940, Britain's steel production only increased by 9.44 million tons. During the two world wars, the level of British industry was only higher than the level of 1913 for a few years, and in most years it was lower than this level. After the Second World War, although for various reasons, such as the renewal of technology and equipment, the withdrawal of Germany, Italy, and Japan from the competition stage of the capitalist world market, and the militarization of the British economy, its industry has been in a so-called post-war "prosperity" state; however, the development of British industry is still limited, and these favorable factors are gradually disappearing, while unfavorable factors are growing.

The following table shows how the development speed of British industry has been after the war.

Post-War British Industrial Production Index
(1948 equals 100)

Year Index Percentage Increase from Previous Year
1949 106.3 6%
1950 113.6 7%
1951 117.2 2.5%
1952 114.1 -2.5%
1953 121.1 6%
1954 129.6 5.6%
1955 136.6 5.4%
1956 136 -0.4%

When talking about the development speed of British industry, one must see the characteristics of the British economy: first, British industry has developed by cruelly exploiting the people of the colonies and plundering the wealth of colonial countries. Britain has a large amount of investment in colonies and backward countries, from which it obtains high profits. This relatively reduces investment in British domestic industry. Second, British industry has a particularly large dependence on the world market. More than 20% of British industrial products are exported after the war. When the competition in the capitalist world market is becoming increasingly fierce, and when West Germany has become a terrible rival to British industry, the development speed of British industry is bound to be deeply affected. Third, Britain is poor in native resources, and only 10% of the raw materials produced domestically, while many important raw materials are completely dependent on imports. The vigorous development of the colonial liberation movement after the war has not only lost important commodity markets for British industry, but also lost important raw material markets.

It should also be mentioned that accompanying the development of British industry is a continuous economic crisis. It has caused enormous damage to productivity and brought unparalleled pain to the British people. From 1920 to 1935, 14 million spindles were destroyed in the textile industry, and one-third of the factories in the shipbuilding industry closed down. During the 1929-1932 crisis, the unemployed accounted for 22% of the total number of employees in the country.

In the peaceful competition of two different social systems, capitalism has insurmountable, innate weaknesses. The leap-forward progress of our country's economic construction is beyond the imagination of the British ruling group. Fifteen years later, they will be even more amazed to see how great a miracle the Chinese people have created.

### 英国工业水平怎样？

　　英国工业水平怎样？
　　本报记者　潘非　苏蓝
    “在十五年后，苏联的工农业在最重要的产品的产量方面可能赶上或者超过美国，我们应当争取在同一期间，在钢铁和其它重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国。”——刘少奇
    打开英国地图，人们可以看到：在面积不大的英伦三岛上，紧密地排列着一个又一个的城市。而每一个城市，往往又是巨大的工业枢纽。伦敦，集中着电气、化学等工业企业，它的产值占全英国工业产值的29％。在伯明翰周围，密布着矿井和冶金工厂；考文垂是汽车和航空工业的中心；格拉斯哥是著名的造船工业基地；而在曼彻斯特周围，则是密布着的纺织工厂……。
    尽管在第一次世界大战后英国作为一个工业国家的地位已经降低，但是人们不能不承认，它仍然是一个工业水平相当高的国家。英国全部就业人数，包括政府机构的职员在内，共计二千二百八十九万人，但在工业部门中工作的人数是一千一百九十三万人，即占一半以上。
    当我们提出“十五年内赶上英国”的口号以后，伦敦的新闻界对此保持缄默态度。只有为数极少的报纸，在不显著的地位发表了简短的报道。但是，即使在英国的统治集团中的人士也不能不对中国人民的豪迈气概感到吃惊。
    在这篇通讯里，我们想提供一些数字和资料，来说明英国的工业目前处于一个什么样的水平。
    英国几种主要工业产品1956年的产量，根据官方的统计是：钢　二千零六十六万吨铁　一千三百十七万吨煤　二亿二千二百七十万吨石油　十五万吨（1955年产量）电力　八百八十五亿瓩时棉布　十六亿一千二百万码
    英国钢的产量，在资本主义世界中占第三位。远在1895年，它的钢产量就接近我国现在的水平，为四百二十六万吨，以后即逐年增加。铁的产量较少，这是因为英国是个老大的工业化国家，有大批废铁可以回炉的缘故。第二次大战以后，由于继续扩军备战和更新战时破坏的装备，对金属的需求增加了，钢铁产量也很快增加。按照英国当局的计划，到1962年时，英国钢的年产量将达二千八百万吨。
    钢铁工业是英国工业中技术水平较高的工业之一。据统计，由战后重建和新建的现代化的工厂生产出的铁占整个铁产量的24％；钢占21％。
    在英国工业的发展中，突出的事实是金属制造工业特别是汽车制造业及轻金属工业的迅速增长。从1935年到1948年，金属制造业提高了208％；1954年金属制品、机器、车辆的生产，比1948年又提高了37％。在1955年，英国的各种机车产量为一千二百二十九辆；各种汽车为一百二十七万零九十辆；工作母机为十五万吨。
    在电力生产方面，近几年来的发展也是相当快的。英国的水利资源有限，所以主要是用火力发电。第一所原子能发电站在1956年开始发电，发电能力为九万二千瓩。
    英国工业的发展是非常不平衡的。钢铁、化学、汽车等工业部门，在英国被称为新的工业，采煤和纺织工业，则被称为旧的工业。前者技术设备较新，发展较快，后者则几十年来一直处于萧条状态。
    英国的煤矿工业已经存在了七百多年。在第一次世界大战前的半个世纪，煤的产量增加了三倍多，直到1913年的最高峰——年产二亿八千七百多万吨。这样，英国的煤就占据了世界市场，约为世界煤总出口的55％。但是，自从1913年以后，这个工业就逐渐衰退了。它经历着长期的危机。这种衰退是由于以下原因引起的：第一，劳动力缺乏；第二，技术设备落后；第三，其它国家的煤、石油、电力产量的增加，使英国煤的出口日益减少。英国当局虽然把煤矿收归国有，但这只不过被用来为私人垄断组织发财致富，因为在把陈旧的矿井“收归国有”后，对旧矿主支付了巨额的补偿费，而煤矿本身的情况并未改善，劳动条件十分恶化（在1952年一年中，英国煤矿工业中每三名工人就有一名遭到人身事故）。直到1955年，英国煤的产量也只不过二亿二千一百多万吨，它不但远远落后于1913年的水平，而且还不及1938年的水平。据说，英国已经有了一个新的“发展计划”：争取到1965年达到年产二亿五千万吨煤。
    和采煤工业一样，纺织业也在急剧衰退中。现在的棉布产量，还不及1937 年的二分之一。从1951年以后的几年中，棉布的产量几乎是逐年减少。
    英国的工业是经历了漫长的道路发展起来的。如果从资产阶级的共和国成立之日算起，那么到现在已经有三百零八年；如果从英国开始产业革命算起，到现在也有二百多年。同西欧其他的资本主义国家比较起来，英国的工业水平不能算低，发展的速度不能算慢。相反，在第一次世界大战以前，英国一直享有
  “世界工场”的称号。但是，如果同社会主义国家工业的发展速度比较起来，那么就不能同日而语了。在1890到1940整整的五十年中，英国的钢产量仅仅增加了九百四十四万吨。在两次世界大战期间，英国的工业水平只有很少几年高于1913年的水平，而绝大多数年份则是低于这一水平。第二次世界大战以后，虽然由于种种原因，如技术设备的更新，德、意、日等退出了资本主义世界市场的竞争舞台，以及英国经济的军事化等等因素，使得它的工业一直处于所谓战后“繁荣”状态；但是，英国工业的发展仍旧是有限的，而且这些有利的因素正在日渐消失，不利的因素却正在增长。
    从下面的表中，可以看出战后英国工业的发展速度是怎样的。
    战后英国工业生产指数
    （1948年等于100）
    比上一年增
    年份　指数　加的百分比
    1949　106.3　6％
    1950　113.6　7％
    1951　117.2　2.5％
    1952　114.1　－2.5％
    1953　121.1　6％
    1954　129.6　5.6％
    1955　136.6　5.4％
    1956　136　－．4％
    在说到英国工业发展速度的时候，不能不看到英国经济的特点：第一，英国工业是依靠残酷地剥削殖民地人民与掠夺殖民地国家的财富发展起来的。英国在殖民地和落后国家有着大量的投资，从这些国家里获得高额的利润。这就相对地减少了英国本国工业的投资。第二，英国工业对世界市场有特别大的依赖性。战后英国工业产品中有20％以上是出口的。当资本主义世界市场的竞争日益尖锐的时候，当西德已成为英国工业可怕的劲敌的时候，英国工业的发展速度势必要受到深刻的影响。第三，英国本土资源贫乏，国内生产的原料只有10％，而许多重要原料则完全依靠进口，战后殖民地解放运动蓬勃发展，对英国工业来说不仅丧失了重要商品市场，同时也丧失了重要原料市场。
    还应该提到，伴随着英国工业发展的，是连绵不断的经济危机。它使生产力遭到巨大的破坏，给英国人民带来了无比的痛苦。从1920到1935年，纺织工业中有一千四百万纱锭被毁坏，造船工业中有三分之一的工厂关了门。在1929—1932年危机期间，失业者占全国职工总人数的22％。
    在两种不同社会制度的和平竞赛中，资本主义有着无法克服的、先天的弱点。我国经济建设的飞跃进展，是出于英国统治集团的想像之外的。十五年后，他们更会惊异地看到：中国人民创造了多么伟大的奇迹。
