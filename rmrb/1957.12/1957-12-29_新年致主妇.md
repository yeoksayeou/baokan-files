New Year's Greetings to Housewives

Dear Housewives:

The New Year is just around the corner. We warmly congratulate you and your family on a happy New Year and good health.

Whenever we celebrate New Year's and other holidays, we always have a habit: thinking about the past and looking to the future, so that we can move towards our ideals and hopes at the beginning of the year. A saying well-known to everyone in our country, "The whole year's work depends on a good start in spring," is a correct summary of the lives of working people. Dear housewives, as the New Year approaches, you must also be thinking about all sorts of questions. Although some of you live in the countryside and some in the city, and although the questions you think about may be different, as housewives, you must be thinking about a common question: how to make your family live better in the new year? Yes, this question should indeed be thought about carefully. Who doesn't want their family to live a better life!

Family life includes all aspects, such as eating, clothing, improving living standards, and raising children... Today, we will only talk about how to arrange family life.

How can family life be arranged well? The only good way is "diligence and thrift in managing the household" as pointed out by the Party and Chairman Mao. Diligence means being hardworking, which means everyone must work hard; thrift means being frugal, and living a life of careful calculation. You manage all the housework, so naturally you cannot put all your energy into productive labor like your husbands and sons, but as long as you arrange the housework well, you will enable your husbands and sons to participate in productive labor better. So don't underestimate housework; managing housework well is also of great benefit to the country!

Perhaps some people will say that managing housework is very simple now. The amount of grain and cloth is fixed every year, and everything is supplied by quota, so you can't waste it even if you want to. You can't say that. That's not the case. If you don't believe it, look at your neighbors, relatives, and friends. The same family and the same income, but their lives are not the same—some live very well, some live normally, and some live very frugally, even lacking food and clothing. Why? Because they don't know how to plan and don't calculate. As the saying goes, "Eating doesn't make you poor, wearing doesn't make you poor, but not knowing how to plan will make you poor." Therefore, the first thing in living a life is to have a plan and know how to plan.

What should be planned? Where should planning start? Broadly speaking, we must live within our means and base all family expenses on reliable income. Spending money casually, buying whatever you see, or even spending twice as much as you earn, will lead any family to poverty. When calculating income, you must be realistic. For example, in the countryside, you must use the income of a normal year as the standard, and you cannot calculate based on a special year of bumper harvest; in the city, employee wages can only be calculated based on normal wages, and "over-quota bonuses" and "subsidies" cannot be included. When calculating expenses, you must be frugal and have reserves—savings—to cope with unexpected and temporary expenses. As long as you pay attention to these two aspects, your family life will generally not have major problems.

In small terms, everything must be carefully calculated, and you must pay attention to saving everywhere. Don't look down on small things; small things piled up become big things. A needle and a thread, a piece of firewood and a grain of rice, if spent improperly, will bring you great difficulties in the long run. For example, if a person wastes one ounce of rice a day, how much can your family of five waste in a year? One hundred and fourteen catties of rice. In your current situation, if each person saves one ounce of rice a day, it will not have any impact on your life, but you will save one hundred and fourteen catties of grain in a year. One wastes, one saves, and the difference is two hundred and twenty-eight catties. See how big a number this is! You don't notice when you use an extra ounce of rice, and you don't notice when you save an extra ounce of rice, but in this imperceptible way, completely different results occur. Can this be said to be a small thing? Can it be said that grain and cloth are rationed, and there is no way to waste them even if you want to? This is just a small example. In all other aspects, such as burning firewood, buying vegetables, making clothes... as long as you pay attention to diligence and thrift and carefully calculate, you will bring unexpected benefits to your family life. From this "small thing," you can clearly see the secret of why the same family and the same income, some people live very well and are well-off, while others live very frugally, even lacking food and clothing.

1958 is a year of particularly important significance. From this new year, our country will catch up with and surpass the level of the United Kingdom in terms of major industrial output in about fifteen years. Also from this year, we began to enter the second five-year plan. Work hard, dear housewives, if you manage your housework well, you will enable your husbands and sons to better participate in the country's socialist construction and better study. In the future, fifteen years later, at the conference celebrating the victorious completion of surpassing the UK's industrial level, the people of the whole country will congratulate you with sincere respect for your contribution to this great struggle.

### 新年致主妇

    新年致主妇
    亲爱的家庭主妇们：
    新年就要到了。我们热烈地祝贺你和你的全家新年快乐，身体健康。
    每逢过年过节，我们总有个习惯：想想过去，看看将来，以便在一年开始的时候，就向着自己的理想、自己的希望前进。我国人人知道的一句格言：“一年之计在于春”，这正是劳动人民对自己生活的正确总结。亲爱的主妇们，你们在新年将要来到的时候，一定也想着各种各样的问题。尽管你们有的住在农村，有的住在城市；尽管你们想的问题各有不同，但是，作为家庭主妇，你们一定想着一个共同的问题：在新的一年里，怎样使自己的家庭生活得更好？对，这个问题确实应该好好地想一想，谁不愿意让自己的家庭生活得更美好呢！
    家庭生活里包括各个方面，诸如吃饭穿衣改善生活问题，教养子女问题，……。今天，我们只谈谈如何安排家庭生活问题。
    怎样才能把家庭生活安排得好呢？唯一的好办法就是党和毛主席给我们指出来的“勤俭持家”。勤，就是勤快，就是人人都要努力劳动；俭，就是俭省，过日子要精打细算。你们操持着全部的家务，自然不能像丈夫、儿子那样把全部的精力放在生产劳动上，但是只要你们把家务事安排得好，就会使丈夫、儿子更好地参加生产劳动。所以不要看轻了家务事，把家务管好，对国家也有很大的好处呢！
    或许有人会说，现在管理家务很简单，一年就是那么多粮，那么多布，一切都是定量供应，想浪费也浪费不了。不能这样说，事实也不是这样的。不信，你向自己的邻居、亲戚、朋友看看，同样的家庭，同样的收入，生活却不是一样——有的生活得很好，有的生活得平常，有的生活得很紧，甚至少吃缺穿。为什么呢？不会打算，没有计算啊。俗语说：“吃不穷，穿不穷，不会打算就受穷”正是这个道理。因此，居家过日子第一要有打算，会计划。
    要打算什么呢？计划应该从何处着手呢？往大处说，要量入为出，把家庭的全部开支，放在可靠的收入基础上。随便开支，见什么买什么，甚至入一个出两个，不论谁家，生活也会要受穷的。计算收入的时候，一定要实事求是。比如在农村，一定要按正常年景的收入作标准，不能按特殊的丰收年来计算；在城市，职工工资也只能按正常工资计算，不能把“超额奖”、“补助费”等也算进去。计算支出的时候，一定本着节约的精神，要有后备力量——节余，以便应付意外临时的支出。只要你注意了这两方面的问题，你的家庭生活大致不会出大问题了。
    从小的方面说，事事要精打细算，处处要注意节约。不要看不起小事情，小事情挤成堆，就成了大事情。一针一线，一柴一米，如果开支不当，日子长了，也会给你带来很大的困难。比方说吧，一个人一天浪费一两米，你家里五口人，一年能浪费多少呢？一百一十四斤米。在你们现在的情况下，如果每人每天节省一两米，对生活不会发生任何影响，可是一年就节省下一百一十四斤粮食。一个浪费，一个节省，里外就是二百二十八斤。你看这是多大一个数目啊！多用一两米不觉，多省一两米也不觉，在这不知不觉间，就发生了完全不同的结果，这能说是小事情吗？这能说粮食、布匹都有定量，想浪费也无从浪费吗？这只是举个小例子，其它如烧柴、买菜，作衣服……一切方面，只要你注意勤俭，细细打算，都会给你的家庭生活带来意想不到的利益。从这件“小事情”上，也就可以十分清楚地看出，为什么同样的家庭、同样的收入，有人过得很好，很宽裕；有人过得很紧，甚至少吃缺穿的秘密了。
    1958年是具有特别重要意义的一年。从这个新的年份起，咱们国家要在十五年左右，在主要的工业产量方面，赶上和超过英国的水平。也是从这一年起，我们开始进入第二个五年计划了。努力吧，亲爱的家庭主妇们，你们把自己的家务管好，就能使自己的丈夫、儿子更好地去参加国家的社会主义建设，更好地去学习。将来，十五年后，我们在庆祝胜利完成超过英国工业水平的大会上，全国人民会怀着衷心的敬意，祝贺你们在这个伟大斗争中的贡献。
