Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 25th: The "New York Herald Tribune" said on the 24th that a "new isolationism" is emerging in Western European countries, which is manifested in a reluctance to become missile bases for the United States.

	The newspaper's editorial stated that this "isolationism" was proposed by Norway and Denmark at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Paris meeting, and it has become the subject of a major debate in the British House of Commons. The "isolationism" referred to by the newspaper actually refers to the neutral sentiment in Western Europe.

	The editorial said that Europeans understand that because intercontinental missiles can fly across the entire continent, "the United States has now become the front line." At the same time, they are very clear that the United States has not yet made its own missiles, so they hope that the United States will be less "preachy," and "they are not in a hurry to negotiate (with the United States) on intermediate-range rockets that (the United States) is not even ready with now."

	The editorial expressed strong anxiety about this "isolationism" in Western Europe, believing that it is a "real danger" to the United States' "policy of strength," and that "isolationism" will develop into a "pacifism" that "undermines" this effort.

    西欧中立主义情绪增长
    美国报纸表示强烈不安
    新华社25日讯　纽约消息：“纽约先驱论坛报”24日说，西欧国家目前正在出现一种“新的孤立主义”，这种主义表现为不愿成为美国的导弹基地。
    这家报纸的社论说，这个“孤立主义”是挪威和丹麦在北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议上提出的，它已经成了英国下院的大辩论的内容。这家报纸所谓的“孤立主义”，实际上也就是指西欧的中立情绪。
    社论说，欧洲人了解，由于洲际导弹可以飞过整个洲，因此“美国现在就成了前线”。他们同时非常明白，美国还没有制成自己的导弹，因此他们希望美国少来些“说教”，“他们并不急于就（美国）现在甚至尚未准备好的中程火箭（同美国）进行谈判”。
    社论对于西欧这种“孤立主义”表示强烈的不安，认为这对美国“实力政策”的努力是一个“真正的危险”，“孤立主义”会发展成为一种“破坏”这种努力的“和平主义”。
