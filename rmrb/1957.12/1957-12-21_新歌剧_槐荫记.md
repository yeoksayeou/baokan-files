The "Story of the Huaiyin Tree," performed by the Central Experimental Opera House, is a new opera with a classical style. It reflects the laboring people's yearning for a free and happy life and portrays the irreconcilable contradictions between the laboring people and feudal forces. The opera absorbs the expressive techniques of national opera music and makes bold attempts. At the same time, in terms of performance and directing, it also learns from the excellent traditions of national opera. The performance of "The Story of the Huaiyin Tree" is a new attempt by new opera to accept the heritage of national art. Through this artistic practice, it will provide some experience for new opera in expressing historical subjects.

    新歌剧“槐荫记”
    中央实验歌剧院演出的“槐荫记”是一个具有古典风格的新歌剧，它反映了劳动人民对于自由幸福生活的向往，并且表现了劳动人民与封建势力之间不可调和的矛盾。戏里吸取了民族戏曲音乐的表现手法，进行了大胆的尝试。同时在表演与导演方面，也学习了民族戏曲的优良传统。“槐荫记”的演出是新歌剧在接受民族艺术遗产中的一个新的尝试。通过这次的艺术实践，将为新歌剧在表现历史题材方面提供一些经验。
