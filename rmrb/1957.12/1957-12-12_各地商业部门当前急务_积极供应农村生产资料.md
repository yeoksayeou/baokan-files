Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Actively organizing the supply of production materials to rural areas has become an urgent task for commercial departments in various regions.

Due to the large scale and rapid pace of the agricultural great production movement launched in rural areas this year, the demand for farmland water conservancy construction materials and agricultural tools is not only large in quantity but also urgent in terms of time. Since November, various production materials have been continuously transported to rural areas, but there is still a considerable gap between this and the actual demand. Relevant central departments believe that in addition to actively taking measures to meet the needs of rural areas as much as possible, all regions should pay attention to conservation, especially for farmland water conservancy materials, old tools and materials should be utilized, and substitutes should be used. At the National Commercial Work Planning Conference, which closed on December 5th, participants unanimously agreed to adopt the policy of actively organizing sources of goods, actively supplying, and actively supporting when discussing the supply of various production materials for the peak season rural market. The conference also decided to expand the supply of hardware, coal, cement, and other materials in the fourth quarter. It has now been decided to immediately allocate the following to various regions: 94,000 tons of cement, more than 1,900 tons of lead wire and round nails, more than 1,300 bolts of window screen, as well as a large number of coal, iron shovels, pickaxes, rickshaw tires and other materials. The power machinery urgently needed in rural areas this winter and next spring has been unified arranged by the State Economic Commission. Commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions are actively preparing for other production materials. The supply and marketing cooperative in Hubei Province alone will increase the supply of various production materials throughout the province next year by one-third compared to this year.

At present, commercial departments in various regions have adopted the method of organizing sources of goods and supplying them at the same time, striving to transport materials to rural areas in a timely manner. Since the fourth quarter, state-owned commercial departments in Shanghai have been transporting round nails, lead wire, iron shovels, hammers, handcarts, etc., worth more than 16 million yuan, to various regions. At the same time, they have sent people to Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, and other places to understand the needs of rural areas for tools and equipment for water conservancy construction, in order to continue to organize sources of goods. By the end of November, Laiyang and other five special districts and Qingdao and Zibo cities in Shandong Province had produced more than 160,000 various water conservancy tools and more than 210,000 various small agricultural tools for farmers, and they have been successively transported to rural areas.

In organizing the supply of materials, the staff of commercial departments in various regions have demonstrated creativity, doing everything possible to tap potential and find sources of goods. The staff of the Chongqing commercial department cleaned out more than 27,000 iron tools such as cross picks and blasting bars from warehouses and have transferred them to rural areas in more than 20 counties including Fuling and Nanchong. The Chongqing Production Materials Supply Station and the Municipal Hardware Machinery Company consulted with many factories and mining enterprises in the city and transferred several hundred tons of steel to rural areas for local tool manufacturing. Rural areas in various parts of Shaanxi Province urgently need a batch of deep well water carts. The Provincial Department of Industry convened relevant departments, arranged for the production of deep well water carts, and planned to transform the existing 8,000 shallow well water carts into more than 4,000 deep well water carts.

    各地商业部门当前急务
    积极供应农村生产资料
    新华社9日讯　积极组织生产资料供应农村，已成为当前各地商业部门一件紧急的任务。
    由于今年各地农村掀起的农业大生产运动规模大、动手快，所需要的农田水利建设器材和农具不但数量大，而且时间紧迫。自11月份以来，各种生产资料就已源源运入农村，但和实际需要量还有不少距离。中央有关部门认为除了积极采取措施，尽可能满足农村的需要以外，要求各地注意节约，特别是农田水利器材，应该利用旧有工具器材和采用代用品。12月5日闭幕的商业部全国计划会议在讨论旺季农村市场各种生产资料的供应时，到会人员一致同意采取积极组织货源、积极供应、积极支援的方针。会上并决定扩大第四季度五金器材、煤炭、水泥等物资的供应量。现在已决定立即先拨给各地的有：水泥九万四千吨，铅丝、元钉一千九百多吨，窗纱一千三百多匹，以及大批煤、铁铲、洋镐、力车胎等物资。今冬明春农村所迫切需要的动力机械，已由国家经济委员会作了统一安排。对其他生产资料，各地商业部门和供销社正在积极准备中。仅湖北省供销社明年全省各种生产资料的供应额将比今年增加三分之一。
    目前各地商业部门采取了边组织货源、边供应的办法，争取及时把物资运到农村。上海市国营商业部门第四季度以来，一面把已组织的价值一千六百多万元的元钉、铅丝、铁锹、榔头、手推车等运到各地，一面派人到江苏、安徽、河南、湖北、四川、贵州等地了解农村对兴修水利的工具器材的需要情况，以便继续组织货源。山东省莱阳等五个专区和青岛、淄博两市，到11月底，已为农民生产了各种水利工具十六万多件、各种小农具二十一万多件，并已陆续运到农村。
    在组织物资供应中，各地商业部门的职工发挥了创造性，他们千方百计地挖掘潜力，寻找货源。重庆市商业部门的职工从仓库里清理出二万七千多件十字镐、炮钎等铁制工具，已调运到涪陵、南充等二十多个县的农村。重庆市生产资料供应站和市五金机械公司同市内许多厂矿企业协商，调剂出几百吨钢材运到农村，供各地就地制造工具。陕西省各地农村急需一批深井水车，省工业厅就召集各有关部门，安排了深井水车的生产，并计划把现有八千部浅井水车改造成为四千多部深井水车。
