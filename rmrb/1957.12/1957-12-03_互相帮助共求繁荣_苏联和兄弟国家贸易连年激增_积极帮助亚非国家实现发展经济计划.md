    Mutual Assistance for Common Prosperity
    Trade Between the Soviet Union and Fraternal Countries Increases Year After Year
    Actively Helping Asian and African Countries Implement Economic Development Plans
    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd December: TASS reports that the total volume of Soviet foreign trade in 1956 reached over 29 billion rubles, more than four times higher than in 1946.
    According to materials from the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade, trade with socialist countries accounted for 76% of the total volume of Soviet foreign trade last year, with China ranking first. Trade with China, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Poland alone accounted for more than one-half of the total volume of Soviet foreign trade.
    Trade between the Soviet Union and non-socialist countries accounted for 24% of the total volume of Soviet foreign trade last year. Finland, Britain, France, and West Germany played a major role in trade with non-socialist countries.
    Soviet trade with Southeast Asian and Near Eastern countries has almost tripled in the last six or seven years.
    Machines and equipment accounted for 17% of total Soviet exports. In terms of volume, the quantity of Soviet equipment exports has increased more than twentyfold since the war.
    The Soviet Union now ranks fifth in the world in terms of industrial equipment exports (the order of the top four is the United States, Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the German Democratic Republic).
    The Soviet Union is also a major supplier of mineral ores, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and asbestos. In 1956, the Soviet Union ranked first in the world in terms of manganese ore exports. In the same year, the Soviet Union provided more than nine million tons of iron ore to the people's democracies, the highest amount of iron ore exported in Soviet foreign trade in any year.
    Grain, timber, and anthracite are also traditional Soviet exports. In 1956, grain exports amounted to 3.2 million tons. Britain is the Soviet Union's largest timber customer, accounting for almost half of the Soviet Union's timber exports to Western countries.
    France, Italy, the Netherlands, and the Nordic countries are the largest consumers of Soviet anthracite, with France being the largest. In 1956, Soviet exports of oil and petroleum products exceeded 10 million tons.
    In terms of cotton exports, the Soviet Union ranks third in the world, after the United States and Mexico.
    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd December: TASS reports: According to materials from the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade, Soviet trade with Southeast Asian and Near Eastern countries has almost tripled in the last six or seven years. These countries are important customers for Soviet machinery and equipment, steel, oil, and petroleum products.
    In 1956, more than one-half of the machinery and equipment and steel, and about one-third of the oil and petroleum products exported by the Soviet Union to non-socialist countries were exported to these countries.
    Currently, the Soviet Union trades with thirteen countries in Southeast Asia and the Near East under various trade agreements. In 1956, the Soviet Union imported 97% of its cotton, 37% of its spices, 28% of its rice, and 20% of its wool, citrus fruits, and tea from these countries. In the same year, the Soviet Union exported 70% of its cotton fabrics, 58% of its cement, and 45% of its sugar to these countries.
    In recent years, the Soviet Union's exports to Southeast Asian and Near Eastern countries have mainly been machinery and equipment, steel, oil and petroleum products, timber, cement, cotton fabrics, and wheat.
    At the same time, the Soviet Union is also a major customer, and sometimes even the main customer, for many commodities produced in this region. Leather raw materials from India, Afghanistan, and Iran; cotton and rice from Egypt; livestock from Turkey; rice from Burma; citrus fruits from Morocco; spices from India; and cotton, wool, and olive seeds from Afghanistan and Iran are all mainly exported to the Soviet Union.
    The Soviet Union regularly exports various types of machinery and equipment, instruments, and apparatus to India, Burma, Indonesia, Egypt, Afghanistan, and other countries to help implement these countries' economic development plans. In the past, when the young Republic of India suffered from a severe famine, Soviet exports to India were mainly wheat; now, steel and various industrial equipment account for the largest share of Soviet exports to India.
    Due to the development of Afghanistan's textile industry, the Soviet Union, at Afghanistan's request, increased its supply of automobiles and certain industrial equipment in 1957, greatly reducing its exports of cotton fabrics.

    互相帮助共求繁荣
    苏联和兄弟国家贸易连年激增
    积极帮助亚非国家实现发展经济计划
    据新华社2日讯　据塔斯社报道，1956年苏联对外贸易总额达到二百九十亿卢布以上，比1946年增加了四倍以上。
    根据苏联对外贸易部的材料，去年，同社会主义阵营国家的贸易在苏联对外贸易总额中占76％，其中中国占第一位。单是对中国、民主德国、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰的贸易就占苏联对外贸易总额的二分之一以上。
    苏联同非社会主义国家的贸易去年在苏联对外贸易总额中占24％。在同非社会主义国家的贸易中占主要地位的是芬兰、英国、法国和西德。
    苏联在最近六、七年来同东南亚和近东国家的贸易几乎增加了三倍半。
    苏联的出口总额中有17％是机器和设备。就体积来说，战后苏联设备出口的数量增加到二十倍以上。
    就工业设备出口额来说，苏联现在占世界第五位（头四名的次序是美国、英国、德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国）。
    苏联也是大宗供应矿砂、黑色和有色金属以及石棉的国家。在1956年，拿锰矿砂出口额来说，苏联占世界第一位。在同一年，苏联提供给各人民民主国家的铁矿砂达到九百万吨以上，这是苏联历年对外贸易中铁矿砂出口最高的一年。
    谷物、木材、无烟煤也是苏联传统的输出品。在1956年，谷物输出额是三百二十万吨。英国是苏联木材的最大主顾，苏联向西方国家输出的木材中，英国几乎占一半。
    法国、意大利、荷兰和北欧国家都是苏联无烟煤消费量最大的国家，其中法国最多。1956年，苏联石油和石油产品输出额已经超过一千万吨。
    拿棉花输出额来说，苏联仅次于美国和墨西哥而占世界第三位。
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社报道：根据苏联对外贸易部的材料，最近六、七年来苏联同东南亚和近东国家的贸易额几乎增加了三倍半。这些国家是苏联的机器和设备、钢材、石油和石油产品的重要主顾。
    1956年，苏联向非社会主义国家输出的机器设备和钢材有二分之一以上，石油和石油产品有三分之一左右是输出到这些国家的。
    现在，苏联根据各种贸易协定同东南亚和近东的十三个国家进行贸易。1956年，苏联进口的棉花有97％、香料有37％、大米有28％、羊毛、柑桔和茶叶有20％来自这些国家。这一年，苏联出口的棉织品有70％、水泥有58％、糖有45％是输往这些国家的。
    最近几年来，苏联向东南亚和近东各国输出的商品主要是机器设备、钢材、石油和石油产品、木材、水泥、棉织品和小麦等。
    同时，苏联也是这个地区国家出产的许多商品的大主顾，有时甚至是主要的主顾。印度、阿富汗和伊朗的皮革原料、埃及的棉花和大米、土耳其的牲口、缅甸的大米、摩洛哥的柑桔、印度的香料、阿富汗和伊朗的棉花、羊毛和橄榄种子，都是以苏联为最大的输出对象。
    苏联经常向印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、埃及、阿富汗及其他国家输出各种类型的机器设备、器械和仪器，以帮助实现这些国家的经济发展计划。从前，当年青的印度共和国遭受严重的粮荒时，苏联对印度的出口主要是小麦；而现在，苏联向印度输出的商品中，钢材和各种工业设备占了第一位。
    由于阿富汗纺织工业的发展，苏联在1957年根据阿富汗的请求，增加了汽车和某些工业设备的供应，大大减少了棉织品的出口。
