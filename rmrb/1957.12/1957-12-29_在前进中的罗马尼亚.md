    Romania Moving Forward
    By our correspondent Ding Man

    New Achievements in Agricultural Transformation
    Romania is actively carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture. The socialist sector now accounts for 46% of the total agricultural land area. These achievements have mostly been made in the recent period. This year, all the farmers in the entire Constanța region have joined collective farms, and in other regions, entire counties and townships of farmers have also joined cooperatives.

    Romania's agricultural collectivization movement began in 1949, but its progress has not been smooth. Not long ago, when I visited Constanța region, the secretary of the regional Party committee told me about the cooperative situation in their region.

    According to him, Constanța region was one of the most economically backward regions in Romania. The soil was very poor, and before liberation, it was mostly occupied by landlords and rich peasants. In 1933, about 30% of the people died due to illness and poverty. After liberation, the People's Government distributed 116,000 hectares of land to the peasants. The socialist transformation of agriculture began in March 1949. By 1952, 35,000 peasant households had joined collective farms. After that, the collectivization movement stagnated. At the Second Party Congress held two years ago, shortcomings in leading the agricultural transformation were criticized. After the meeting, Constanța region set a plan to complete the collectivization of the entire region in three years. But they completed agricultural collectivization in one year and ten months.

    By October of this year, 100,000 peasant households in the region had formed 336 collective farms. The state provided them with 33 tractor stations, owning 5,200 tractors, seeders, and combine harvesters, and equipped them with a large number of agrotechnical personnel.

    Great Construction Projects
    In the past, when people talked about Romania, they always remembered to talk about its oil and grain, because it was known as the "granary" of Eastern Europe and was also famous for its oil production. But after liberation, its metallurgical, machine-building, and chemical industries have developed rapidly, and it has changed from a backward agricultural country to an industrial-agricultural country. Now, whenever Romania is mentioned, one cannot help but talk about its electric power industry with its bright prospects.

    A major project in Romania's ten-year electrification plan is the Lenin Hydropower Station with a generating capacity of 210,000 kilowatts, which is currently under active construction and will be able to generate electricity by 1961. With the development of industry and agriculture, there is a need to supply more electricity, and the Lenin Hydropower Station alone is not enough. Therefore, they decided to cooperate with Yugoslavia to build the Iron Gate Hydropower Station on the Danube River at a place called Iron Gate.

    According to the plan, a 550-meter-long dam will be built at the Iron Gate site, with a bottom width of 38 meters, and a railway and highway will be built on the top of the dam. Twelve turbine generators will be installed in the power plant, each with a generating capacity of 185,000 kilowatts, which means that the total generating capacity of the Iron Gate Hydropower Station will be 2.22 million kilowatts. Its reservoir area is more than 17,100 hectares, with a water depth of 70 meters.

    It is expected that this great project can be completed after two more years of surveying and design, and seven years of construction.

    This huge project is comparable in the world only to the Kuibyshev in the Soviet Union and the Grand Coulee Dam in the United States. It will become the main source of electrification for both Romania and Yugoslavia. This project is progressing smoothly with the help of the Soviet Union.

    The Victory of the Party's National Policy
    Romania is a multi-ethnic country. Among the population of more than 17 million, ethnic minorities account for 2.5 million. The Hungarian ethnic group has a relatively large population, and they mostly live in the Transylvania region. Before liberation, this region was alternately ruled by the Hungarian or Romanian landlord and bourgeois governments. During the rotating rule of the two reactionary governments, the contradictions between the Romanian and Hungarian ethnic groups were repeatedly created, including barbaric and cruel mutual massacres.

    The liberation in 1944 brought light and happiness to all ethnic groups in Romania. The Party successfully applied the Marxist-Leninist national policy. In 1952, the People's Government established the Hungarian Autonomous Region in Târgu Mureș, where Hungarians lived in a concentrated area. Among the 740,000 people in this region, more than 70% are Hungarians, more than 20% are Romanians and other ethnic groups. When I visited the autonomous region, I learned that the vast majority of the leaders of the regional government were Hungarians, and Romanians were individual cases.

    After liberation, the face of the autonomous region has been completely renewed. In recent years, more than 200 central and local enterprises have been established. The modern Simo Ghecja furniture factory, which produces 3,500 sets of wooden furniture per month, has started production. It is one of the largest factories of its kind in Eastern Europe. The blast furnace in Fleroișa is dissolving iron ore day and night, brown coal is being mined in Fulkiping, and the Rehmandanua milk powder factory, which is under construction, is one of the largest in socialist countries. Due to the development of industry, the number of workers in the region has increased from 15,000 before liberation to more than 60,000.

    Agriculture in the autonomous region, like agriculture in other parts of the country, is undergoing collectivization. At present, the area of collectivized land accounts for 29% of the total land area of the region.

    The cultural and educational undertakings of the autonomous region are changing with each passing day. Of the 60,000 illiterate people left over from before liberation, only 2,300 remain. Among the nearly 100,000 primary and secondary school students, 70,000 are Hungarians. They all use their own language to study.

    Fraternal Friendship
    The Romanian comrades do not regard building socialism as a matter for one country. They said:
  "Our people clearly know that without the help of the Soviet Union and the mutual assistance and cooperation of the countries in the socialist camp, it would be impossible to achieve our current achievements."

    The relationship between Romania and China is also getting closer and closer. The two countries support each other spiritually and materially. In many factories in Romania, you can see workers producing generators, drilling machines, or chemical products for China. Of course, in their factories, you can also see iron ore and cotton from China, and in stores you can see Chinese silk fabrics, soap, and canned food.

    The Romanian comrades showed fraternal friendship to the Chinese people. During the scientific and technological cooperation negotiations between the two countries this year, they said: "Whatever China needs, as long as we have it, we can give it to you." They believe that this is an obligation that a brotherly country should fulfill.

    Romanian comrades like to read the Selected Works of Mao Zedong. Comrade Liu Shaoqi's book "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists" is also popular with them. They hope to learn more about China's situation and experience.

    They are very warm to Chinese comrades. In cities or villages, we often encounter that when a Romanian asks you what country you are from, once they say you are Chinese, they will warmly shake your hand and excitedly shout "Mao Zedong."

    在前进中的罗马尼亚
    本报记者　丁曼
    农业改造的新成就
    罗马尼亚正在积极地进行农业的社会主义改造。现在农业的社会主义部分已占农业土地总面积的46％。这些成就多半是在最近一个时期内取得的。今年，康斯坦萨整个州的农民都参加了集体农庄，在其他州也有整县整乡的农民都参加了合作社。
    罗马尼亚的农业合作化运动，从1949年就已经开始，但它并不是一帆风顺地向前发展的，不久以前在我访问康斯坦萨州时，这里的党委书记告诉了我他们州的合作化情况。
    据他说，康斯坦萨州是罗马尼亚经济上最落后的一个州。土质很坏，解放前又多为地主富农所占有。1933年有30％左右的人因疾病、贫困而死亡。解放后，人民政府把十一万六千公顷土地分给了农民。从1949年3月开始了农业的社会主义改造。到1952年已有三万五千户农民参加了集体农庄。从这以后，合作化运动就停滞不前。在两年前召开的第二次党代表大会上曾经批评了领导农业改造中的缺点，会后，康斯坦萨州订出了三年完成全州合作化的计划。但他们却用一年零十个月的时间完成了农业集体化。
    到今年10月间，全州的十万户农民组成了三百三十六个集体农庄。国家给他们准备了三十三个拖拉机站，拥有五千二百部拖拉机、播种机和联合收割机。配备了大批的农艺技术人员。
    伟大的建设工程
    以前，人们在谈到罗马尼亚时总是忘不了谈它的石油和粮食，因为它有东欧的“谷仓”之称，也以出产石油著名。但在解放以后，它的冶金、机器制造和化学工业已迅速发展起来，它已由一个落后的农业国变为工业农业国。现在每逢谈到罗马尼亚时，不由得就要谈到它的有美好远景的电力工业。
    罗马尼亚十年电气化计划中的一项主要工程，是发电能力为二十一万瓩的列宁水电站，目前正在积极建设中，到1961年就可发电。随着工农业的发展，需要供应更多的电力，仅仅列宁水电站是不够的。因此，他们决定在多瑙河上名叫铁门的地方，和南斯拉夫合作兴建铁门水电站。
    根据计划，将在铁门地方建筑起一道五百五十公尺长的拦水坝，它的底宽是三十八公尺，坝顶上将修筑铁路和公路。在发电厂将安装起十二部透平发电机，每一部的发电能力是十八万五千瓩，这就是说，铁门水电站的总发电能力为二百二十二万瓩。它的蓄水库的面积有一万七千一百多公顷，水深七十公尺。
    预计再经过两年的勘测设计，七年的施工，就可以完成这一伟大的工程。
    这个规模巨大的工程，在世界上只有苏联的古比雪夫和美国的大库利水电站可以和它相媲美。它将成为罗南两国电气化的主要源泉。这一工程正在苏联的帮助下顺利进行。
    党的民族政策的胜利
    罗马尼亚是个多民族的国家。在一千七百多万人口中少数民族占二百五十万人。少数民族人数较多的是匈牙利族，他们多半居住在德兰斯瓦尼亚地区。解放前，这个地区曾经轮番地被匈牙利或罗马尼亚的地主资产阶级政府所统治，在两个反动政府轮班统治期间，曾一再地制造过罗马尼亚和匈牙利两个民族的矛盾，其中包括野蛮残酷地互相屠杀。
    1944年的解放，给罗马尼亚各族人民带来了光明和幸福。党成功地运用了马克思列宁主义的民族政策。1952年，人民政府在匈牙利人居住较集中的特尔古·木列士地方建立了匈牙利自治州。在这个州的七十四万人口中有70％多的匈牙利人，有20％多的罗马尼亚人和其他民族。当我访问自治州时，了解到州政府的绝大多数领导人都属匈牙利族，罗马尼亚人是个别的。
    在解放以后，自治州的面貌焕然一新。近几年来建立起了两百多中央和地方的企业单位。月产三千五百套木器家具的现代化西摩·格查家具制造厂已经开工生产，它是东欧这类工厂中最大的一个。弗勒伊沙的高炉在日夜溶解着铁矿砂，在富尔基平开采着褐色煤矿，正在施工的莱曼丹亚奶粉工厂是社会主义国家中最大的一个。由于工业的发展，全州的工人队伍已由解放前的一万五千人发展到六万多人。
    自治州的农业也像全国其他地方的农业一样在进行合作化。目前合作化的土地面积已占全州土地面积的29％。
    自治州的文化教育事业日新月异。解放前遗留下的六万个文盲现在只剩下了两千三百个。在近十万个中小学生中，有七万个是匈牙利人。他们都用自己的语言来学习。
    兄弟般的友谊
    罗马尼亚的同志们没有把建设社会主义看成是一个国家的事情。他们说：
  “我国人民清楚地知道，如果没有苏联的帮助和社会主义国家阵营各国的互助合作，要达到我们现在的成就是不可能的”。
    罗马尼亚和中国的关系也越来越密切。两国在精神和物质上互相支持着。在罗马尼亚的很多工厂里都可以看到工人们在为中国生产发电机、钻探机或化学产品。当然在他们的工厂里也可以看到来自中国的铁矿砂和棉花，在商店里可以看到中国的丝织品、肥皂和罐头。
    罗马尼亚的同志对中国人民表现了兄弟般的情谊。在今年两国举行科学技术合作谈判时，他们说：“中国需要什么，只要我们有，都可以给你们”。他们认为这是一个兄弟国家应尽的义务。
    罗马尼亚的同志爱看毛泽东选集。刘少奇同志的“论共产党员修养”一书，他们也喜欢读。他们希望更多的了解中国的情况和经验。
    他们对中国同志很亲热。在城市或乡村，我们常碰到，当一个罗马尼亚人问你是哪国人时，一说是中国人，他们就亲切地和你握手，兴奋地喊着“毛泽东”。
