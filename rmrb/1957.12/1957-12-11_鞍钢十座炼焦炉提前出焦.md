Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 10th. The tenth large coke oven built by Anshan Iron and Steel during the First Five-Year Plan—the new No. 2 coke oven—began producing coke today.

　　The coking industry is an important part of the Anshan Iron and Steel complex. It supplies the coke used for ironmaking and the gas used for steelmaking and rolling steel.

　　Vice Premier Li Fuchun mentioned in his report on the development of the First Five-Year Plan that ten new and rebuilt coke ovens were to be built in Anshan from 1953 to 1960. This plan has now been completed ahead of schedule.

　　In the past five years, Anshan Iron and Steel has consistently regarded the coking industry as one of the key areas for investment and construction. In the process of completing these projects, thousands of builders, under the guidance of Soviet experts, overcame various difficulties and mastered the complete set of design, equipment manufacturing, and construction installation skills.

　　The early completion of the coke oven construction plan has enabled this iron and steel industrial base to increase its production capacity of coke, gas, coal tar pitch, benzene, and ammonium sulfate fertilizer by about three times compared to 1952. The large amount of coke produced here, in addition to meeting the needs of Anshan Iron and Steel's nine large blast furnaces, is also supplied to many domestic machine manufacturing plants, smelting plants, and chemical plants. Some brother countries are now also using coke produced here.

　　The gas produced by the coke ovens at Anshan Iron and Steel, in addition to being supplied to the smelting system as fuel, is also mixed with the gas produced by the blast furnaces to supply more than 152,000 residents of Anshan as domestic fuel.

　　With the development of the coking industry, three chemical recovery workshops have also been built accordingly.

### 鞍钢十座炼焦炉提前出焦

　　鞍钢十座炼焦炉提前出焦
    新华社鞍山10日电　在第一个五年计划期间鞍钢建设的第十座大型炼焦炉——新二号炼焦炉，10日开始生产出焦炭。
    炼焦工业是鞍山钢铁联合企业的重要组成部分，炼铁用的焦炭，炼钢、轧钢等使用的煤气，就依赖它供应。
    李富春副总理在关于发展国民经济第一个五年计划的报告中，曾提到从1953年到1960年的八年中，要在鞍山新建和改建十座炼焦炉，现在这个计划已经提前完成了。
    在过去五年中，鞍钢一直把炼焦工业当作投资建设的重点之一。在完成这些工程的过程中，数千名建设者在苏联专家的指导下，克服了种种困难，并且掌握了设计、设备制造和建筑安装的成套本领。
    炼焦炉建设计划的提前完成，使这个钢铁工业基地生产焦炭、煤气、焦油沥青、苯类、硫铵肥料等的能力，比1952年增长了三倍左右。这里生产的大量焦炭，除了供应鞍钢九座大型高炉的需要外，还供应给国内许多机器制造厂、冶炼工厂和化学工厂，有些兄弟国家，现在也使用着这里出产的焦炭。
    鞍钢炼焦炉发生的煤气，除了供给冶炼系统作燃料外，还和高炉发生的煤气混同供应着鞍山十五万二千多居民作生活燃料。
    随着炼焦工业的发展，这里还相应地建设了三个化学回收车间。
