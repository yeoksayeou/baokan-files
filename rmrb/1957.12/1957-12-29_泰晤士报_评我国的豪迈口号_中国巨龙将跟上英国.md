Xinhua News Agency, London, 28th: The British "Times" commented on China's slogan of "Catching up with Britain in Fifteen Years" on the 27th, warning: "We had better pay attention, there may soon be a dragon closely following behind us."

The newspaper said that while the Soviet Union is challenging the United States in the industrial competition, China also believes it has the same task in its relationship with Britain.

The newspaper mentioned Vice Premier Li Fuchun's speech at the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, saying: "The Chinese are deeply convinced that they can catch up with us in the production of coal, machine tools, cement, and fertilizers. This competition with the selected opponent is indeed a great, glorious, and arduous task set for the Chinese workers. In less than fifteen years, Britain will surely be defeated."

    “泰晤士报”评我国的豪迈口号
    中国巨龙将跟上英国
    新华社28日讯  伦敦消息：英国“泰晤士报”27日在评论中国提出的“十五年赶上英国”的口号时警告说：“我们最好还是要注意，可能很快就会有一条巨龙紧跟在我们的后面。”
    这家报纸说，当苏联正在工业竞赛方面向美国挑战的同时，中国也认为它在同英国的关系上负有同样的任务。
    报纸提到李富春副总理在中国工会八大上的讲话，它说：“中国人已经深信他们能在煤、工作母机、水泥和肥料生产方面赶上我们。同选定的对手进行这种竞赛的确是为中国工人规定的伟大、光荣和艰巨的任务。不到十五年的功夫，英国必定要被打败。”
