    First of all, I thank the Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for inviting me to attend the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions.
    Secondly, I would like to extend the warm greetings of the headquarters and all members of the All-Indonesia Muslim Trade Union to the Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, all the delegates, and all those present at the congress.
    Respected Chairman and fellow brothers attending the congress:
    It is indeed of great significance for me to be able to attend the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions. This not only allows me to meet the sons and daughters of the People's Republic of China, but also allows me to meet workers' representatives from various countries. I hope that my visit will strengthen our friendship.
    Brothers, as you all know, the political belief that our country adheres to is in line with the spirit and character of our Indonesian nation and is based on the "Five Principles of Nationhood." In addition, our country pursues an independent and active foreign policy.
    Although differences in beliefs, views, and politics cannot weaken our good relations. In other words, we can cooperate and stand shoulder to shoulder without sacrificing or weakening our respective political beliefs and with mutual respect.
    Because, apart from the above differences, we share the following commonalities with you:
    1. Common historical and cultural points and connections.
    2. Love and defense of peace.
    3. Opposition to imperialism and colonialism.
    We Indonesian workers are fighting to build our country, destroy the colonial economic structure, and build a national economic structure.
    Since the struggle to peacefully return West Irian to the Republic of Indonesia within the framework of the United Nations has been thwarted, I ask for your support. Now the workers and the government have taken a clear stance, taking over Dutch enterprises. The day after we set off to visit your country, Indonesian workers prevented the planes of the Dutch Royal Airlines from taking off and took over these planes.
    We do not hate the Dutch people, but we hate the policies of Dutch imperialism. We firmly oppose any form of colonialism.
    Respected Chairman and fellow brothers:
    In order to build our country, we will learn from you and wish this congress a brilliant success that will benefit not only the people of the People's Republic of China, but also the workers of the whole world.
    We will unhesitatingly learn from your good, useful, and suitable experiences that are in line with the national and national characteristics of Indonesia.

    全印度尼西亚穆斯林工会代表
    苏达诺致词
    首先，我感谢中华全国总工会主席邀请我前来参加中国工会第八次全国代表大会。
    其次，我谨向中华全国总工会主席、各位代表和出席大会的全体人员，转达全印度尼西亚穆斯林工会总部及全体会员的热烈敬意。
    尊敬的主席和出席大会的兄弟们：
    我能够参加中国工会第八次代表大会，对我来说，这的确是有重大意义的。这不仅使我能够同中华人民共和国的儿女们见面，而且也使我能够同来自各国的工人代表们相识。我希望，我这次的到来能够增强我们的友谊。
  兄弟们都已知道，我们国家所奉行的政治信仰是符合于我们印度尼西亚民族的精神和性格的，而且是以“建国五个原则”为基础。此外，我们国家实行着独立的和积极的外交政策。
    虽然信仰、观点和政治上的不同，并不能削弱我们的良好关系。换句话说，我们是可以在不牺牲或削弱各自奉行的政治信仰以及互相尊重的情况下，进行合作和肩并肩地在一起。
    因为除了上述的不同点以外，我们和你们之间还存在这样的共同点：
    1．有历史和文化的共同点和联系。
    2．热爱和保卫和平。
    3．反对帝国主义和殖民主义。
    我们印度尼西亚工人正在为建设国家，摧毁殖民主义经济结构和建设民族的经济结构而斗争。
    由于在联合国范围内，通过和平方式来争取西伊里安重新返回印度尼西亚共和国的怀抱的斗争已遭到挫折，因此，我请求你们的支援。现在工人和政府已采取了明确的态度，接管荷兰的企业。我们动身前来访问贵国的第二天，印度尼西亚工人禁止荷兰皇家航空公司的飞机起飞，并接管了这些飞机。
    我们不是憎恨荷兰人，但我们憎恨荷兰帝国主义的政策。我们坚决反对任何形式的殖民主义。
    尊敬的主席和各位兄弟：
    为了建设我们的国家，我们将向你们学习，并预祝这次代表大会取得不仅有益于中华人民共和国人民，而且有益于全世界工人的辉煌成就。
    我们将毫不犹疑地学习你们好的、有用的、而且符合于印度尼西亚的民族和国家特点的经验。
