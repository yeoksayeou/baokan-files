　　Wang Ersao gave birth to a baby less than a year after getting married. The baby was fair and chubby. But recently, many millet-like bumps appeared on the baby’s little face, densely packed together. The baby cried day and night, and the round little face often rubbed against the clothes and pillow, turning red. Sticky fluid oozed, and later bumps appeared on the body and limbs. Wang Ersao had no choice but to go to the doctor. The doctor said, "This is infant eczema."
    What is infant eczema?
    Infant eczema is a common skin disease in infants, and it is also more common in winter. This disease usually affects children who eat a lot and are chubby. When it occurs, the child's forehead and cheeks suddenly turn red. If you look closely, there are many very dense, slightly raised small papules or small blisters, which are very itchy. After the skin is scratched, light yellow sticky fluid flows out, which dries and forms a thick scab. Severe eczema can spread to the trunk and limbs. If handled properly, it can gradually improve, but unless the cause is found, it often recurs, sometimes mild and sometimes severe.
    How does eczema occur?
    There are several possible reasons: The most common is that some babies are sensitive to certain foods—such as milk, eggs, fish, and shrimp; or they are sensitive to things they breathe and come into contact with. Some also develop certain things that can cause allergies due to digestive and metabolic imbalances. All of these can cause infant eczema. In addition, wearing too much clothing, an unbalanced diet, constipation, drinking too little water, eating too much, poor digestion, bathing too often, and too high room temperature can also worsen the condition of eczema or cause recurrence.
    What to do if you get "eczema"?
    First, you need to see a doctor (preferably a dermatologist) and follow the doctor's instructions. Don't be impatient. The doctor should decide on the drug treatment based on the condition.
    However, drug treatment alone is not enough. You also need to pay attention to the following:
    Avoid all kinds of stimulation. When sleeping, it is best to wrap the baby's little hands in the bedding to prevent the child from scratching. Do not use soap to wash the child's face. In areas with eczema, only use refined peanut oil or sesame oil to gently lubricate to avoid irritating the skin and aggravating the symptoms. Keep the room clean and free of dust. The temperature should not be too high, and the quilt should not be too thick, as the eczema will become redder and itchier if it is too hot. The clothes the child wears should be loose, not too much or too thick, and should not come into contact with wool or rubber cloth materials. It is best not to wear new clothes.
    Pay attention to the diet. If the baby has poor digestion, the stool contains "milk curds," the baby spits up milk, or the baby's mouth has a bad odor, reduce the amount of milk and add water between feedings. If the diet and bowel movements are normal, then consider whether the child is allergic to a certain food. Some children get sick from drinking milk and get better when they stop drinking milk. This is eczema caused by milk allergy. The milk should be boiled a little longer, which may help. If the child originally drinks breast milk, then the mother should pay attention to not eating stimulants and seafood, and eat less or avoid eating eggs, milk, etc., eat more vegetables, drink more water, and keep bowel movements smooth. Paying attention to these things will greatly help with the treatment of eczema.

　　谈谈婴儿湿疹
　　荷
    王二嫂结婚不到一年就生了一个娃娃，又白又胖。可是最近几天，娃娃的小脸上起了许多小米粒儿似的疙瘩，密密地堆在一起。娃娃不分昼夜地哭闹，圆圆的小脸时常在衣服上、枕头上擦来擦去，脸变得火红。粘水溜溜地流着，后来身上、四肢也起了疙瘩。王二嫂没有了办法，去找大夫。大夫说“这是婴儿湿疹”。
    什么是婴儿湿疹？
    婴儿湿疹，是一种常见的婴儿皮肤病，冬天也比较多。这种病通常是吃得多、长得胖的小孩子容易得。发病时，首先是孩子的额头和面颊突然发红，仔细看，里面有很多非常稠密的、稍稍凸起的细小丘疹或小疱，痒得很厉害；擦破皮以后，流淡黄色粘水，干了就结成厚的痂皮。湿疹厉害的，可以蔓延到躯干和四肢。如果处理得当，可以逐渐好转，但在原因未找出来以前，往往来回复发，时轻时重。
    湿疹是怎样发生的？
    不外乎这几方面原因：最常见的，是有些婴儿对一些吃的东西——如牛奶、鸡蛋、鱼虾等有敏感；或者是对呼吸和接触到的东西有敏感，也有的是因为消化和新陈代谢失调而产生了某些能够引起过敏的东西，这都会引起婴儿湿疹。此外，穿得太多、饮食不调、大便干结、饮水太少、吃得太多、消化不好、洗澡太勤、室温太高等，也会加重湿疹的病情或引起复发。
    得了“湿疹”怎么办？
    首先，要找大夫看（最好是皮肤科大夫），按照大夫的话去做，不要性急。关于药物的治疗，应该由大夫根据病情决定。
    但是，单靠药物治疗不够，还要注意下面这些事情：
    要避免各种刺激。睡觉时，最好把娃娃的小手裹在被褥里，这样可以防止小孩用手去搔。不要用肥皂替孩子洗脸，在有湿疹的部位，只能用炼熟的花生油或者芝麻油轻轻地搽润，以免刺激皮肤，加重症状。房间里要保持清洁，不要有尘土。温度不宜太高，被子也不要太厚，热了湿疹会更红、更痒。孩子穿的衣服要宽松，不要太多太厚，也不要接触毛织品或胶布做的东西，最好不穿新衣服。
    要注意饮食。如果娃娃消化不好，大便中带“奶瓣”、吐奶或者嘴里有味，要扣一些奶，在两次吃奶之间加一次水。如果饮食大便都很正常，那么就要考虑，孩子是不是对某种食物过敏。有些小孩因为吃了牛奶而得病，不吃牛奶就好了。这就是由于对牛奶过敏而发生的湿疹，应该把牛奶多煮一会儿，可能好一些。如果孩子原来就吃妈妈的奶，那么妈妈应该注意不要吃刺激品和鱼虾海味，少吃或免吃鸡蛋、牛奶等，多吃蔬菜、多喝水，保持大便通畅。注意这些事，对湿疹的治疗会有很大帮助。
