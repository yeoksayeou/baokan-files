　　Appropriate Demands Should Be Made of Children
　　Guan Ruiwu
    Appropriate demands should be made of children, that is to say, they should be given certain tasks according to their abilities and experience. Why should children be required appropriately? Because, if children are not required or required inappropriately, they will often be naughty, disobedient, make trouble, or be willful because they have nothing to do or do not know how to do it.... How should children be required? The most important point is that while making appropriate demands on children, they must also be respected.
    For example, three-year-olds can be asked to help their mothers hand things over, and when their mothers are cooking, they can help peel beans and wipe tables and chairs. When children go to bed and get up, teach them to button and unbutton their clothes themselves. Three-year-olds do not have enough control, and their movements are not flexible enough. Adults should help them while gradually increasing the demands on them. However, the demands on children should not exceed their abilities. For example, one mother asked her five-year-old child to carry a five-pound thermos to fetch water. The thermos was too heavy, and the child could not hold it and broke it. The mother instead said that he was useless. This will make the child lose confidence and feel very wronged.
    In daily life, the phenomenon of demanding too little or not at all from children is more common. When children reach the age of six or seven, they can be allowed to do things independently. They can be allowed to tidy up their own things and take care of the yard at home. However, some parents often overlook this point, always saying that the children are still young, and everything is done by the adults for the children. As a result, the children will make trouble and be naughty because they have nothing to do.
    The demands on children should be specific and clear. What you say should be understandable within the scope of the child's experience. For example, when parents go out, they always hope that their children will play well at home. Then they should specifically ask him: "Mom is going out, you can sunbathe in the yard, don't mess with things in the house, and put the dolls away after playing..." If you only say: "I'm going out, you have to be good at home." This requirement is not clear. Is moving things around considered "being good"? The adults' requirements are not clear or specific, and they do not tell the child what is right and what is wrong. You can't blame the child for not listening.
    No matter what you ask your child to do, you must patiently consider the specific situation at the time. For example, the child is concentrating on building blocks, and the mother insists that the child set the bowls and chopsticks for dinner. Although this request itself is reasonable, he is building his beloved building, so he should not be disrupted casually and rudely. Parents should patiently say to the child: "It's time to eat. After you finish building this pillar, go set the bowls and chopsticks. We'll build more after dinner." Some parents do not pay attention to these situations and will say to their children: "Hurry up, it's time to eat, no building, quickly set the bowls and chopsticks." This disrespectful tone makes it difficult for children to accept your demands on them.
    When asking children to do things, trust them. When you consider that he can do this thing, let him do it, and show that you believe he can do it well. Some parents don't believe in their children. Sometimes they are very willing to help adults do things, but they say: "You're just making trouble." This disrespect for children will make them lose confidence. When parents ask their children to do things, they should express their belief that he will do better this time than last time. When a child does something well, not only should you encourage him, but you should also make higher demands on him that he can do. This will not only allow the child to be satisfied with encouragement, but also exercise the child's will to persevere and overcome difficulties.
    Educating children is a delicate task, and different children should have different requirements. Each child's physical strength, life experience, and development are different. Parents must make demands based on the characteristics of their own children.

### 对孩子要有适当的要求

　　对孩子要有适当的要求
　　关瑞梧
    对孩子要有适当的要求，也就是说，应当根据孩子的能力和经验，交给他一定的任务。为什么对孩子要有适当的要求呢？因为，如果对孩子没有要求或者要求不恰当，孩子常常会由于没有事情做或是不知道怎样做，就会淘气、不听话、胡闹、任性……。应该怎样要求孩子呢？最主要的一点，是既要对孩子有适当的要求，同时又必须尊重孩子。
    比方，对三岁的孩子可以要求他们帮助妈妈递点东西，妈妈做饭的时候，让他帮忙剥剥豆子、擦擦桌椅。孩子睡觉和起床的时候，教他自己扣扣子、解扣子。三岁的孩子，控制能力还很不够，动作也不灵活，大人要一边帮助他，一边逐渐提高对他的要求。但是，对孩子的要求，不能超过他的能力。例如，有一个妈妈让五岁的孩子提着五斤来重的暖水瓶去打水，暖水瓶太重，孩子拿不动打破了，妈妈反而说他不中用。这样会使孩子丧失了信心，也会使孩子感到很委屈。
    在日常生活里，对孩子要求太低，或者是没有要求的现象是比较多的。孩子到了六、七岁就可以让他自己独立地去做点事。可以让他们收拾自己的东西，照顾家里的院子。但是，有些父母常常忽略了这一点，总说孩子还小，什么事都由大人替孩子做了。结果孩子倒会因为没事做而捣乱、淘气。
    对孩子的要求，应当具体明确。你说的话，应当是孩子经验范围内能够明白的。例如，当父母出门的时候，总希望孩子在家里好好地玩，那么就应当具体地对他提出要求说：“妈妈出门了，你可以到院子里晒晒太阳，不要把屋里的东西乱翻乱搬，玩完了把娃娃放好……”如果只说：“我出去，你在家要好好的。”这要求就不明确。把东西搬来搬去算不算“好好的”呢？大人的要求不明确、不具体，没给孩子指明怎样做是对，怎样做就不对，这就不能怪孩子不听话了。
    无论要求孩子做什么事，必须耐心地考虑到孩子当时的具体情况。例如，孩子正在用心搭积木，母亲硬要孩子去摆吃饭用的碗和筷子。虽然这个要求本身是合理的，但是，他正在那搭他心爱的建筑，所以不应该随意粗暴地打乱他。做父母的应当耐心地对孩子说：“该吃饭了，你搭完这边的柱子，就去摆碗和筷子吧，等吃完饭再搭。”有的父母不注意这些情况，就会对孩子这样说：“快点，该吃饭啦，不许搭啦，快摆碗和筷子。”这样不尊重孩子的口吻，是不容易使孩子接受你对他的要求的。
    要求孩子做事情的时候，要信任他。当你考虑这件事是他能办到的，就让他去做，并且要表示相信他能做好。有些父母不相信孩子，有时候很愿意帮大人做点事，反倒说：“你又来捣乱了。”这样对孩子不尊重，会使孩子丧失信心。父母在要求孩子作事的时候，应当表示相信他这一次一定比上次做得好。孩子做好了一件事不但要鼓励他，同时还要向他提出更高的、他能办到的要求。这不致于使孩子光是满足于鼓励，而且能锻炼孩子坚持克服困难的意志能力。
    教育孩子是一件细致的工作，对于不同的孩子要有不同的要求。每个孩子的体力、生活经验和发育是不同的，做父母的必须根据自己孩子的特点提出要求。
