Xinhua News Agency, December 18th – In the past two to three months, more than twenty art troupes in the capital have successively gone to rural areas and factories to tour.

Actors from the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe went to Tong County, Hebei Province, to perform for rural cadres and workers. The Central Philharmonic Orchestra Symphony Orchestra performed for workers and farmers in Fengtai, Nanyuan, and the eastern suburbs. The Central Experimental Opera House's recently restaged opera "The White Haired Girl" has also been performed in areas such as the Fengtai workers' district. This opera house will also perform "Huaiyin Ji" for the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. In the first five months of the second half of this year, the China Peking Opera Theater performed for workers more than three times the number of performances in the same period last year, and is now performing at suburban workers' clubs.

The capital's art troupes have also performed wonderful programs such as Pingju opera and quyi for workers and peasants.

At present, theaters, troupes, and song and dance troupes are preparing to send their best repertoires to factories and rural areas, in accordance with the provisions of the "1958 National Art Performance Troupe Tour Performance Conference."
