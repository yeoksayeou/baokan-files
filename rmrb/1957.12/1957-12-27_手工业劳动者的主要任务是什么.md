What is the Main Task of Handicraft Laborers?

The First Members' Representative Assembly of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives has concluded yesterday. This assembly is a conference to summarize the experience of our country's handicrafts transforming from individual economy to collective economy, and also a conference to study how our country's handicrafts can continue to advance on the socialist road. Conscientiously implementing the resolutions and spirit of this assembly will allow our country's existing more than 100,000 handicraft cooperatives (groups) to be further consolidated and improved, the ideological transformation of more than 20 million handicraft laborers can be deepened, and handicraft production will also develop at a faster pace.

Our country is still a country with relatively backward modern industry but very developed handicrafts. Handicraft production has a long history and a broad mass base. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the total output value of handicrafts accounted for about 18% of the national industrial output value. What is particularly important is that handicrafts have many industries, flexible business methods, and many varieties of products. There are manufacturing industries, as well as repair and service industries. Some produce means of production, some produce consumer goods, and some produce arts and crafts. Some are produced in fixed workshops, and some are repaired by wandering through streets and villages. Precisely because handicrafts have these characteristics, they play an important role in adapting to the dispersed, complex, and ever-changing social needs, in supporting agricultural production and national construction, in supplying export needs, and in accumulating funds for the country and expanding social employment. Not only now, but also in the long period after the great development of modern industry in our country in the future, handicrafts will still be an indispensable assistant to modern large-scale industry. Now, our country's First Five-Year Plan has been successfully completed, and the more ambitious Second Five-Year Plan is about to begin. The Party and the government have put forward the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously on the basis of giving优先发展to heavy industry, striving to achieve the goals stipulated in the Draft National Agricultural Development Program of Forty Articles within the next ten years, and striving to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years, so that our country will become a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. This is a glorious, great, and arduous task. Collective handicraft laborers who have embarked on the road of socialist development are an important force in the socialist construction army composed of 640 million people in our country, and are an important force in completing this great and arduous task. Handicraft laborers should actively undertake their due share of the task and strive with the people of the whole country to realize this grand ideal.

In order to achieve this grand goal, the main tasks of our country's handicraft laborers in the next three to five years are: to continue to complete the socialist transformation, and to further consolidate and improve the existing handicraft cooperatives (groups) politically, ideologically, organizationally, and economically; to strive to ensure that the annual growth rate of total output value is not lower than the average growth rate of industrial and agricultural production during the same period, in accordance with the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical; and to gradually improve their material and cultural life on the basis of social production development.

After the high tide of the socialist revolution last spring, the task of socialist transformation of our country's handicrafts in terms of ownership has been basically completed. The shortcomings existing in handicraft production during the individual economy period, such as dispersion, backwardness, blindness, and conservatism, as well as high material consumption, low output rate, and high costs, have been initially overcome with the change of ownership, creating favorable conditions for further development of production in the future. However, the socialist transformation of handicrafts on the political and ideological fronts has not been completed. Among the more than 100,000 cooperatives (groups), only about 30% have strong leadership, good production, and a relatively solid foundation. Judging from the political and ideological status of the members, more than 70% are handicraft workers and poor independent laborers. They suffered from exploitation, oppression, and unemployment in the old society, and generally warmly support the cooperative system. However, they also have more or less the ideological influence of small producers, and when dealing with the relationship between the individual and the collective, freedom and discipline, and democracy and centralization, they often show individualistic, liberalistic, and economistic ideological tendencies. As for the small owners and wealthy laborers who account for about 25% of the total number of members, their capitalist ideological tendencies are quite serious. Some of them yearn for the capitalist road in the sharp struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. Some people ask to withdraw from the cooperative, and some even carry out sabotage activities. Among the grassroots cadres of the cooperative, the vast majority are diligent and conscientious, but due to lack of experience and training, some people bring the patriarchal style to the cooperative; some people often proceed from the cooperative's parochialism, disregard national interests and consumer interests, pursue profits, and adopt capitalist management methods. The above-mentioned small producer ideology and capitalist ideology are incompatible with the socialist nature of the cooperative. Allowing these ideas to continue to exist and develop, one day, the cooperative organization will disintegrate, and the socialist transformation of handicrafts will fail. We must carry out the struggle between the two roads in depth on the political and ideological fronts in the cooperative organization, overcome the small producer ideology and capitalist ideology among members and cadres, and carry out the cause of socialist transformation to the end. This is a long-term and arduous task. At present, the main task is to carry out a universal rectification, consolidation, and socialist education movement in the handicraft system in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee on the whole people's rectification, improve the socialist consciousness of the members, improve the leadership level of the cadres, and further consolidate and improve the cooperative organization.

Carrying out the rectification, consolidation, and socialist education movement in handicraft cooperatives is essentially to enable the vast number of handicraft laborers to further accept socialist transformation through self-education. In this movement, we must rely on handicraft workers and poor independent laborers, give full play to their enthusiasm for taking the socialist road, unite the relatively wealthy and skilled members, and expose and criticize the capitalist tendencies of the original small owners and some wealthy independent laborers. On the basis of full airing of views, debate, major rectification, and major improvement, organize members to conduct major debates on some major issues of right and wrong, especially the issue of the two roads. In the debate, by presenting facts, reasoning, recalling comparisons, and calculating detailed accounts, the majority of members can clarify right and wrong from their personal experience, raise awareness, and overcome the influence of capitalist ideology. Because the ideological transformation of handicraft laborers is a long-term task and cannot be completed by one movement, it is necessary to strengthen daily political and ideological work after the rectification, so as to truly consolidate the cooperative politically, ideologically, and organizationally in three to five years.

Some landlords, puppet military and political officials, reactionary party and League backbones, secret agents, bandits, hooligans, and local bullies have also sneaked into the handicraft cooperatives. Many of them are dissatisfied with the new society, do not work honestly, and even engage in conspiracy activities to sabotage the cooperative, oppose socialism, and oppose the leadership of the Communist Party. Therefore, in the rectification, consolidation, and socialist education movement, we must strictly distinguish the problems of these bad elements from the shortcomings and errors of ordinary members and cadres, and rely on the masses to thoroughly expose and criticize them, and carry out a resolute struggle against them. Those current counter-revolutionaries and bad elements with serious destructive behavior should be punished by law. In this way, the cooperative organization can be further purified through the rectification movement.

The Party Central Committee teaches us that we must run all undertakings diligently and thriftily. Handicraft cooperatives are collectively owned production enterprises, and handicraft laborers were originally poor. To develop production and improve living standards, it is especially necessary to implement the policy of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily." Diligence means diligent production, tapping production potential, and actively expanding reproduction according to needs and possibilities. Thrift means practicing strict economy, reducing production costs, and opposing extravagance and waste. Not only should we be diligent and thrifty in production, but also in the members' welfare. The increase in members' wages should not only be higher than the increase in labor productivity, but also be compatible with the level of social wages. In cities, members' wages should not be higher than the wages of workers in state-owned factories in the same industry with roughly the same technical conditions and labor productivity; in small towns and rural areas, they should not be too high compared to the labor income of farmers. In terms of labor insurance and welfare, we can only focus on solving the problem of members' medical treatment at present. Other welfare undertakings should be gradually carried out according to the principle of economy after production develops, according to priorities and urgency. Only by being diligent and thrifty in production can we use limited funds and raw materials to produce more, better, and cheaper products to better meet social needs. Only by being diligent and thrifty in living and welfare can we continuously increase the accumulation of cooperatives, rapidly expand reproduction, and have a reliable guarantee for the improvement of members' lives. That is to say, we must combine immediate interests with long-term interests. To conscientiously implement the policy of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily," in addition to formulating some necessary systems in production management as guidelines for work and life, we must also conduct an in-depth education on "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily" among all members and cadres, so that everyone understands diligence and thrift, and everyone thinks of ways to be diligent and thrifty.

Handicraft cooperatives are collective economic organizations of handicraft laboring masses, and their property belongs to all members. The internal relationship is a relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation. Cooperatives must implement democratic management under the principle of democratic centralism, so that members can truly be masters of their own affairs, in order to mobilize the members to consciously implement the policy of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily with more, faster, better and economical results". At present, the democratic life of many cooperatives is unsound. Some cooperatives do not convene members' meetings or members' representative meetings for a long time, do not report work to members and publish accounts, and make decisions on major issues without serious discussion by members. Many cooperative cadres do not know how to follow the mass line, and force orders and act arbitrarily in their work, seriously deviating from the masses. Many members have relatively strong individualism, liberalism, and extremely democratic ideas, one-sidedly believing that democratic management means only democracy, not centralization; only freedom, not discipline; and that with democracy and freedom, they can not abide by labor discipline and can not obey leadership. These situations show that it is very necessary to conduct an in-depth education on democratic centralism. Through education, cadres of cooperatives must understand that they should consult with the masses in everything; that they should adopt the method of persuasion and education for the shortcomings and errors of members, and not the method of coercion and suppression; and that they should handle what the members request that can be done immediately, and that they should explain clearly what should not be done or cannot be done temporarily. Through education on democratic centralism, members must understand that in the cooperative, individuals enjoy extensive democratic rights and freedoms on the one hand, and must be bound by socialist discipline and obey the command of the leadership on the other hand. In this way, there will be a new situation in the cooperative with both centralism and democracy, discipline and freedom, unified will and personal ease of mind, liveliness and vitality. Such a situation is more conducive to coordinating the relationship between cadres and members, and between members, strengthening internal unity, pooling the wisdom of the masses, and running the cooperative well.

Our country's handicrafts have a particularly close relationship with agriculture. Rural areas are the main source of raw materials for handicrafts, and also the main market for handicraft products. At present, about 60% of the industrial products needed in rural areas are handicraft products. For a considerable period of time before the realization of agricultural mechanization, handicrafts are the suppliers of various small farm tools, tools, and building materials. Handicraft cooperatives must face the countryside and establish the concept of serving agriculture. At present, a nationwide upsurge of agricultural production has arrived, and farmers' enthusiasm for building water conservancy projects and accumulating fertilizer is unprecedentedly high. One of the most important tasks facing handicraft cooperatives is to actively supply various small farm tools, tools, and building materials in a timely manner according to the needs of local agricultural production and people's lives, actively organize forces to go to the countryside and mountains, repair and assemble farm tools, and support the great leap forward in agricultural production, under the principle of ensuring both rectification and production. At the same time, a new upsurge in national industrial production has also formed, and many new requirements have been put forward for handicrafts in terms of parts manufacturing and production cooperation. With the rise of industrial and agricultural production, the living standards of urban and rural people will gradually improve, the demand for various daily necessities will continue to increase and change, and foreign trade will also expand day by day. National handicraft cooperative organizations should, on the basis of rectification and consolidation, formulate plans for developing production, and extensively, deeply, and persistently carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, improve product quality, save raw materials, and increase variety and color, so as to meet the diverse needs at home and abroad. In order to better accomplish future tasks, as Vice Chairman Zhu De instructed: "The local committees of the Communist Party of China at all levels and the local state administrative organs at all levels must further strengthen their leadership and management of handicraft cooperatives." We believe that under the leadership of local party organizations and governments at all levels, the national handicraft laborers will surely win victories in the rectification, consolidation, and socialist education movement, and on the production front to support the great leap forward in agricultural production and national industrial construction!

    手工业劳动者的主要任务是什么
    中华全国手工业合作社第一次社员代表大会已于昨天闭幕。这次大会是总结我国手工业由个体经济变为集体经济的经验的大会，也是研究我国手工业如何在社会主义道路上继续前进的大会。认真地贯彻执行这次大会的决议和精神，我国现有的十万多个手工业合作社（组）就可以进一步巩固和提高，二千多万手工业劳动者的思想改造就可以深入一步，手工业的生产也将以更快的速度向前发展。
    我国现在还是一个现代工业比较落后、手工业却很发达的国家。手工业生产有着悠久的历史和广泛的群众基础。在第一个五年计划期间，手工业的生产总值约占全国工业生产总值的18％左右。尤其重要的是，手工业的行业多、经营方式灵活、产品品种花样多。有制造性的行业，也有修理服务性的行业。有生产生产资料的，也有生产生活资料的，还有生产工艺美术品的。有在固定工场生产的，也有串街游乡修理的。正因为手工业具有这些特点，所以，在适应分散的、复杂的、变化多端的社会需要方面，在支援农业生产和国家建设方面，在供应出口需要方面，在为国家积累资金和扩大社会就业方面，都起着重要的作用。不仅现在，就是将来我国现代工业大大发展以后的很长时期中，手工业仍然是近代大工业的不可缺少的助手。现在，我国第一个五年计划已经胜利完成，规模更加宏大的第二个五年计划即将开始。党和政府提出了在优先发展重工业的基础上发展工业和发展农业并举的方针，争取在今后十年内实现全国农业发展纲要草案四十条规定的目标，争取在十五年后，在钢铁和其它重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国，使我国成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。这是一个又光荣又伟大又艰巨的任务。已经走上社会主义发展道路的集体手工业劳动者，是我国六亿四千万人所组成的社会主义建设大军中的一支重要方面军，是完成这个伟大的艰巨的任务的一支重要力量。手工业劳动者应当积极地担负起自己应尽的一部分任务，和全国人民一起，为实现这个远大的理想而奋斗。
    为了达到这个远大的目标，我国手工业劳动者在今后三、五年内的主要任务是：继续完成社会主义改造，从政治上、思想上、组织上、经济上进一步巩固和提高现有的手工业合作社（组）；按照又多又快又好又省的方针，力求每年生产总值的增长速度不低于同期工农业生产总值的平均增长速度；并在社会生产发展的基础上，逐步改善自己的物质生活和文化生活。
    经过去年春天的社会主义革命高潮，我国手工业在所有制方面的社会主义改造任务已经基本完成。手工业生产在个体经济时期存在着的缺点，如分散、落后、盲目和保守，以及用料多、出品率低、成本高等等，已经随着所有制的改变而有了初步的克服，为今后进一步发展生产创造了有利的条件。但是，手工业在政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义改造并没有完成。在十万多个合作社（组）中，只有30％左右是领导力量较强、生产较好、基础比较稳固的。从社员的政治思想状况来看，70％以上是手工业工人和贫苦的独立劳动者。他们在旧社会里受尽剥削、压迫和失业的痛苦，一般是热烈拥护合作化制度的。但是，他们也或多或少地存在着小生产者的思想影响，在处理个人与集体、自由与纪律、民主与集中的关系的时候，往往表现出个人主义、自由主义和经济主义的思想倾向。至于约占社员总数25％的小业主和富裕的劳动者，资本主义思想倾向就相当严重，其中一部分人在社会主义和资本主义两条道路的尖锐斗争中，向往资本主义的道路，有些人要求退社，有的人还进行破坏活动。在合作社的基层干部中，绝大多数是勤勤恳恳的，但由于缺乏经验和锻炼，有些人把家长制作风带到合作社里来；有些人往往从合作社的本位观点出发，不顾国家利益和消费者利益，追逐利润，采取资本主义的经营方式。以上这些小生产者思想、资本主义思想，是跟合作社的社会主义性质不能相容的。让这些思想继续存在和发展下去，有朝一日，合作社组织就会涣散，手工业的社会主义改造事业就会失败。我们必须在合作社组织中，在政治战线上和思想战线上，深入开展两条道路的斗争，克服社员和干部中的小生产者思想和资本主义思想，把社会主义改造的事业进行到底。这是一个长期的艰苦的任务。在目前，主要的是根据党中央关于全民整风的指示，在手工业系统中普遍开展一次整风、整社和社会主义教育运动，提高社员的社会主义觉悟，提高干部的领导水平，进一步巩固和提高合作社组织。
    在手工业合作社内开展整风、整社和社会主义教育运动，实质上就是使广大手工业劳动者，通过自我教育，进一步接受社会主义改造。在这个运动中，必须依靠手工业工人和贫苦的独立劳动者，充分发挥他们走社会主义道路的积极性，团结比较富裕的有技术的社员，揭露和批判原来的小业主和一部分富裕独立劳动者的资本主义倾向。在大鸣大放大整大改的基础上，对于一些重大的是非问题，特别是两条道路的问题，组织社员进行大辩论。在辩论中，通过摆事实、讲道理、回忆对比、算细账的方法，使广大社员从亲身体会中弄清是非，提高觉悟，克服资本主义思想影响。由于手工业劳动者的思想改造是一项长期的工作，不能靠一个运动来完成，所以，在整风以后，还必须加强日常的政治思想工作，才能在三、五年内真正做到从政治上、思想上、组织上把合作社巩固起来。
    在手工业合作社中，还混进了一些地主、伪军政官吏、反动党团骨干、特务、土匪、流氓、地痞等坏分子。他们之中很多人对新社会心怀不满，不老老实实劳动，甚至进行破坏合作社、反对社会主义、反对共产党领导的阴谋活动。因此，在整风、整社和社会主义教育运动中，必须把这些坏分子的问题跟一般社员、干部的缺点和错误严格区别开来，并且依靠群众，彻底揭露和批判他们，对他们进行坚决的斗争。对那些现行的反革命分子和有严重破坏行为的坏分子，应该给以法律制裁。这样，才能通过整风运动，进一步纯洁合作社组织。
    党中央教导我们：必须勤俭办一切事业。手工业合作社是集体所有制的生产企业，手工业劳动者原来就穷，要发展生产，要改善生活，尤其需要贯彻执行“勤俭办社”的方针。勤就是勤劳生产，挖掘生产潜力，根据需要和可能，积极扩大再生产。俭就是厉行节约，降低生产成本，反对铺张浪费。不仅在生产上要勤要俭，在社员的生活福利方面也要勤要俭。社员工资的增长，不仅不能高于劳动生产率的增长，而且要和社会工资水平相适应。在城市，社员的工资不应高于当地同行业、同等技术条件和劳动生产率大致相当的国营工厂工人的工资；在小城镇和农村，不能过高于农民的劳动收入。在劳保福利方面，当前只能着重解决社员的治病问题，其它福利事业应等到生产发展以后，再分别轻重缓急，逐步地按照节约的原则举办。只有在生产上做到勤和俭，才能利用有限的资金和原料，生产更多更好更便宜的产品，更好地满足社会需要。只有在生活福利方面做到勤和俭，才能不断地增加合作社的积累，迅速地扩大再生产，社员生活的提高才有可靠的保证。这也就是说，要把眼前利益和长远利益结合起来。要认真贯彻“勤俭办社”的方针，除了在生产管理方面制订一些必要的制度，作为工作和生活准绳以外，还必须在全体社员、干部中进行一次深入的“勤俭办社”的教育，使人人都懂得勤和俭，使人人都想办法做到勤和俭。
    手工业合作社是手工业劳动群众的集体经济组织，它的财产属于全体社员所有，内部的关系是互助合作关系。合作社必须在民主集中制的原则下，实行民主办社，让社员真正当家作主，才能动员社员群众自觉地贯彻多快好省的“勤俭办社”的方针。现在，许多合作社民主生活不健全。有些合作社长期不召开社员大会或社员代表大会，不向社员报告工作和公布账目，遇到重大问题没有经过社员认真讨论就作出决定。不少合作社干部不懂得怎样走群众路线，在工作中强迫命令，独断专行，严重脱离群众。不少社员有比较浓厚的个人主义、自由主义和极端民主化的思想，片面地认为民主办社就是只要民主，不要集中；只要自由，不要纪律；讲民主自由，就可以不遵守劳动纪律，可以不服从领导。这些情况说明，深入地进行一次关于民主集中制的教育是非常必要的。必须通过教育，使合作社的干部懂得遇事要和群众商量；对社员的缺点和错误，要采取说服教育的办法，而不能采取强迫和压服的办法；对社员提出的要求，应该办又能办的，马上办，不应该办或者暂时不能办的，就要解释清楚。必须通过关于民主集中制的教育，使社员懂得：在合作社里，个人一方面享有广泛的民主和自由权利，另一方面必须受社会主义纪律的约束，服从领导的指挥。这样，合作社里就会出现一个有集中又有民主，有纪律又有自由，有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的新局面。这样的局面更有利于协调干部与社员之间、社员与社员之间的关系，加强内部团结，群策群力，办好合作社。
    我国手工业同农业有着特别密切的关系。农村是手工业原料的主要来源，也是手工业产品的主要市场。目前农村所需要的工业品中，有60％左右是手工业产品。在农业机械化实现以前的相当长的时间内，手工业是各式小农具、工具和建筑材料的供应者。手工业合作社必须面向农村，树立为农业服务的观点。现在，全国范围的农业生产高潮已经到来，农民们兴修水利、积肥的积极性空前高涨。摆在手工业合作社面前的一项最重要任务，就是在整风生产两不误的原则下，积极地根据当地农业生产和人民生活的需要，及时地供应各种小农具、工具和建筑材料，积极组织力量下乡上山，修配农具，支援农业生产的大跃进。同时，全国工业生产的新高潮也已形成，在零件制造和生产协作方面，对手工业提出了许多新的要求。随着工农业生产的高涨，城乡人民生活水平将会逐步提高，对各种日用品的需要将不断增加和变化，对外贸易也将日益扩大。全国手工业合作组织，应该在整风、整社的基础上，制订发展生产的规划，广泛、深入、持久地开展增产节约运动，提高产品质量，节约原材料，增加品种花色，以适应国内外多方面的需要。为了更好地完成今后的任务，正如朱德副主席指示的：“中国共产党的各级地方委员会和各级地方的国家行政机关，必须进一步地加强对于手工业合作社的领导和管理。”我们相信，在各级地方党组织和政府的领导下，全国手工业劳动者一定能在整风、整社和社会主义教育运动中，在支援农业生产大跃进和国家工业建设的生产战线上，都打胜仗！
