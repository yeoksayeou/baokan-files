"Entering Xinwu Hamlet, it brightens up half the sky. With the four pests eradicated, body and mind are so refreshed!" Just like this song, when a reporter steps into Xinwu Hamlet, Song'ao Township, Huanggang County, at the foot of the Dabie Mountains in Hubei Province, they will have an unusual feeling: red-walled and white-painted houses, courtyards swept clean and tidy, neither hearing the chattering of sparrows nor seeing the annoying flies.

However, the Xinwu Hamlet of the past was completely the opposite of today. The area around the hamlet was full of thorns and weeds. Every house had a large dung pit in front of its door. Pigs, cattle, chickens, ducks, and people lived together. Mosquitoes and flies were overwhelming. The eaves were full of sparrow nests, and rats rummaged through chests and cabinets, causing people to be uneasy day and night.

In July of this year, with the help of cadres from the local health clinic and led by three young activists in the hamlet, Fang Xianwen, Ni Suzhen, and Wang Guijin, "three improvements" (improve water sources, improve toilets, improve animal pens) and "six cleans" (clean indoors and outdoors, clean kitchen pots and bowls, clean bodies, clean bedding, clean pens, clean roads) were carried out. After more than two months of effort, mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows have been basically eradicated, making it the first "four-no" village in Hubei Province.

In order to maintain cleanliness, the entire hamlet has established a public pledge, with a small sweeping every day and a big sweeping every five days. Three old women in the hamlet are specifically responsible for collecting scattered human and animal manure around the hamlet; a hygiene inspection team has also been organized to take turns on duty, inspecting and supervising the cleanliness and hygiene of each household.

    “四无塆”
    “走进新屋塆，亮了半个天，四害消灭光，身心多爽朗！”正像这首歌儿一样，当记者一踏上湖北省大别山麓黄冈县宋坳乡新屋塆，就会产生一种异乎寻常的感觉：红墙白壁的房舍，打扫得光坦坦的院落，既听不到唧喳吵闹的麻雀声，也看不见缠人的苍蝇。
    但是，过去的新屋塆和今日完全相反，塆的周围长满了荆棘杂草，家家门前有个大粪窖，猪、牛、鸡、鸭和人住在一块，蚊子苍蝇缠死人，房檐漏洞住满了麻雀，老鼠更是翻箱倒柜，害得人日夜不安宁。
    今年7月间，在当地卫生所干部的帮助和塆里的三个青年积极分子方先文、倪素珍和王桂金的带头下，进行了“三改”（改水源、改厕所、改栏圈）和“六净”（室内外净、厨房锅碗净、身体净、被服净、栏圈净、道路净）。经过两个多月的努力，蚊子、苍蝇、老鼠和麻雀基本绝迹，成为湖北省第一个四无村。
    为了保持整洁，全塆订立了公约，每天一小扫，五天一大扫。塆里有三位老婆婆专门负责收敛散失在塆子周围的人畜粪便；还组织了卫生检查组轮流值日，检查督促各家的清洁卫生。（附图片）

    从前，人们吃水、洗衣和喂牲畜，都混着用一个池塘，现在已把饮水、洗衣和畜用的池塘分开。这是饮水塘。
