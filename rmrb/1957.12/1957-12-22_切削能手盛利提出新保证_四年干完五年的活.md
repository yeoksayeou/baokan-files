Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 21st. The famous high-speed cutting expert and lathe operator of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, Sheng Li, completed nine years' worth of work in less than five years by the 20th. He has put forward a new guarantee: he will complete the work volume of the Second Five-Year Plan in four years, and ensure that the product quality indicators reach 99.5%.

Sheng Li, who visited the Soviet Union with the Chinese Labor People's Delegation last month to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, visited the Kalinin Factory, the Amiralteysky Shipyard, and the Kiev Gorky Machine Tool Plant. He said that after visiting his counterparts in the Soviet Union, he became clear about the direction for further improving cutting efficiency in the future. In the future, he will not simply rely on increasing cutting speed to improve work efficiency, but on the basis of the already achieved high-speed cutting, he will study changing the geometry of the tool, increasing the feed rate, to improve cutting efficiency, and using new multi-tool and multi-blade technologies to shorten auxiliary time. He is full of confidence in realizing his new guarantee.

    切削能手盛利提出新保证
    四年干完五年的活
    据新华社上海21日电  著名高速切削能手、上海机床厂车工盛利，20日以不到五年的时间完成了九年的工作量。他提出了新的保证：将以四年的时间完成第二个五年计划的工作量，而且使产品质量指标达到99.5％。
    盛利在上月随中国劳动人民代表团去苏联庆祝十月革命四十周年时，曾经访问了加里宁工厂、阿米拉杰斯基造船厂和基辅高尔基机床厂。他说，在苏联访问了他的同行以后，使他明确了今后进一步提高切削效率的方向。今后他将不单纯依靠提高切削速度来提高工作效率，而是在已经达到的高速切削基础上，研究改变刀具的几何形状，加大走刀量，来提高切削效率，并且采用多刀多刃的新技术来缩短辅助时间。他对实现自己的新保证满怀信心。
