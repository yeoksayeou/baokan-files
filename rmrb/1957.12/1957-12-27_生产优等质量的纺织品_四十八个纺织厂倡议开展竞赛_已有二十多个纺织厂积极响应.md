Xinhua News Agency report: Representatives from forty-eight textile factories, at a meeting held during the Third National Congress of the Textile Workers' Union of China on the 24th and 25th, proposed to fraternal factories nationwide the launch of a socialist competition centered on producing high-quality textiles to welcome the arrival of the Second Five-Year Plan.

The factories making the proposal include those from the cotton, wool, silk, knitting, and dyeing and printing industries. The speakers' remarks were warmly welcomed by the meeting's delegates.

Wang Yihua, director of Qingdao State-owned Cotton Mill No. 7, on the 24th, first represented twelve cotton textile mills in Qingdao and Jinan in proposing to cotton textile mills across the country the launch of a socialist competition "centered on running enterprises industriously and thriftily and producing high-quality yarn and cloth." The competition conditions they put forward were, on the basis of comprehensively and exceeding fulfilling state plans, that the main products should reach the following targets by the fourth quarter of 1958: 1. Improve the evenness of cotton yarn. While ensuring first-class quality, the evenness of cotton yarn should reach the standard of superior-grade yarn, and those that have already reached it should continue to improve. 2. Reduce cotton yarn defects, so that the number of defects on the cloth surface caused by the spinning workshop, for every hundred pieces, should be reduced by at least 50% if it is above three hundred, and at least 30% if it is below three hundred. 3. Reduce cotton cloth repair defects and increase the first-class rate of finished products, so that the first-class rate of plain cloth produced by automatic looms reaches over 90%. 4. On the premise of improving quality, rationally use and save raw materials, so that the waste cotton from torn cloth is reduced by 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 1957, and electricity should be saved as much as possible, substitutes should be used rationally, non-productive expenses should be reduced, and costs should be lowered. 5. Ensure safe production, eliminate major accidents, and reduce general accidents.

Ge Guoqi, chairman of the trade union of Tianjin State-owned Cotton Mill No. 4, which achieved success in launching the "Zero-Defect Cloth" campaign, made a proposal after Wang Yihua. This factory guarantees that in 1958, on the basis of comprehensively and evenly fulfilling and exceeding the state plan, it will strive to produce more superior-grade evenness yarn and "Zero-Defect Cloth," so that the standard product rate of cotton yarn reaches over 99% for the whole year, the superior-grade yarn reaches over 96%, the first-class rate of cotton cloth reaches over 99.8%, and the "Zero-Defect Cloth" of serge reaches 30%. Specific targets were also proposed in terms of comprehensively saving and utilizing spinnable fibers and increasing new varieties.

Jin Yili, chairman of the trade union of Shanghai State-owned Dyeing and Printing Factory No. 5, representing twelve dyeing and printing factories in Shanghai and Wuhan, said in the proposal put forward at the meeting on the 25th: They want to ensure the improvement of dyeing fastness, the improvement of color vividness, the reduction of shrinkage rate, and the saving and rational use of dyes and chemical materials.

Zhang Guiying, chairman of the trade union of Shanghai Yuhua Cotton, Wool and Linen Textile Factory, read out a proposal at the meeting on the 25th on behalf of six wool textile factories in Shanghai regarding "launching a socialist competition centered on further improving the quality of wool textiles and expanding product varieties." The proposal stated: In the competition, they will strive to overcome quality problems such as pilling, revealing the base, re-dyeing and rework. And make full use of various spinnable fibers to increase the output of wool yarn from cashmere and rabbit hair; actively trial-produce blended products of chemical fibers and artificial wool, as well as pure artificial wool products, and try to use some flax yarn to replace cotton yarn and utilize recycled hemp.

Fei Xiangqing, deputy director of Wuxi Silk Reeling Factory No. 1 in Jiangsu, on behalf of five silk reeling factories in Jiangsu, proposed to fraternal factories that their factories should guarantee the comprehensive over-fulfillment of the 1958 state plan; the standard product rate for the whole year should reach over 95%, and the qualified product rate should reach 99.2%; the average savings of silkworm cocoons per quintal of silk should be three to five jin for the whole year, vigorously improve attendance rate and strengthen safety production education. These factories are located in the near suburbs of the city, and the proposal specifically mentioned that they should use their spare time to help farmers accumulate fertilizer and support rural irrigation.

Five silk weaving factories in Zhejiang, known for producing beautiful silks and satins, entrusted Xue Ruiyun, director of Hangzhou Silk Factory in Zhejiang, to make a proposal at the meeting. They guarantee that in 1958, they will comprehensively and over-fulfill the state plan, practice strict economy, ensure safe production, and ensure that the qualified product rate of main products reaches 97.5% for taffeta, 98% for rayon soft satin, 98.5% for beautiful silk, 99% for Guxiang satin, and 97.5% for brocade satin.

Also presenting proposals at the meeting on the 25th were three knitting factories, including the State-owned Shanghai Knitting Factory, and four factories, including the joint state-private Shanghai Gongzu Socks Factory.

In addition to proposing competition conditions, the proposers also talked about resolutely implementing the policy of building the country industriously and thriftily, running enterprises industriously and thriftily, and running all undertakings industriously and thriftily; strengthening enterprise management, striving to improve technology, deeply developing the advanced producer movement, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the experience of various advanced factories, and effectively strengthening mutual assistance and mutual learning between and within factories to achieve common improvement. Some factories also put forward specific measures on how to ensure the realization of competition conditions.

After these proposals were put forward, more than twenty factories from Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Qingdao, Zhejiang and other places participating in the conference have responded separately. Representatives of many other factories are also brewing responses.

The Third National Congress of the Textile Workers' Union of China opened in Beijing on the 20th. The task of this conference is to: summarize the work of the Textile Workers' Union of China since the Second National Congress, and in accordance with the spirit of the "Eighth National Congress" of the trade union, mobilize textile workers across the country to launch a new production upsurge to welcome the Second Five-Year Plan.
