Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 20th: According to TASS, Kuzmin, Chairman of the Soviet State Planning Committee and First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, delivered a report on the 1958 Soviet National Economic Development Plan at the Supreme Soviet meeting in the Kremlin on the afternoon of the 19th.

    **Preliminary Results for This Year**
    Industrial production increased by 10%, total investment increased by more than 10%, animal husbandry has been fundamentally improved, and the Soviet Union occupies a leading position in scientific and technological progress.

    In his report, Kuzmin discussed the preliminary results of the implementation of the 1957 plan. He pointed out that all fifteen Soviet republics not only fulfilled their industrial production plans but also exceeded them. He also emphasized the enormous role played by the reorganization of industrial and construction management in this regard.

    According to preliminary data, the growth of Soviet industrial production in 1957 was 10%, while the original plan was 7.1%. The production of means of production will increase by approximately 11%, and the production of consumer goods will increase by more than 8%.

    Over the past year, Soviet steel production has increased by approximately 2 million tons, cement by nearly 4 million tons, coal mining by more than 33 million tons, oil extraction by 17%, and gas by 50%. Electricity production this year was 210 billion kilowatt-hours, more than 18 billion kilowatt-hours more than in 1956.

    Total state investment in the national economy increased by more than 10%. Labor productivity in the entire industrial sector increased by 6.5%, exceeding the target for increasing labor productivity.

    Speaking about the agricultural situation, the reporter emphasized that a new and huge agricultural production base has been established in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union. The situation in the previously backward animal husbandry has been fundamentally improved. In 1957, the number of cattle increased by 4 million, goats and sheep increased by more than 8 million, and pigs increased by 6 million.

    According to preliminary statistics, the national income will increase by 6% in 1957, and the actual income of workers and staff will also increase accordingly. The retail trade volume increased by 74 billion rubles in one year, totaling 615 billion rubles.

    Talking about the outstanding achievements of Soviet science and technology in 1957, Kuzmin said: Now, when a new scientific and technological revolution is taking place due to the acquisition and use of atomic energy, the development of rocket technology, and the automation of production, the Soviet Union occupies a leading position in scientific and technological progress.

    **Economic Planning Tasks for 1958**
    Formulated according to the seven-year long-term plan, it is predicted that the total industrial output will increase by 7.6%, the total agricultural output will increase by 17%, and state investment and national income will increase significantly.

    While explaining the tasks of the 1958 Soviet National Economic Plan, Kuzmin pointed out that this plan differs from the 1957 plan in many aspects in terms of its content, tasks, and formulation methods.

    An important feature of the 1958 plan is that its basic direction is based on the tasks stipulated in the seven-year long-term plan, a draft of which has already begun to be drafted.

    The formulation of the 1958 plan is adapted to the new management system of industry and construction; it stipulates better utilization of the natural and production resources of each republic and improvement of economic ties between republics.

    The 1958 plan only assigned tasks to the republics on the most important indicators.

    The plan stipulates that the total industrial output will increase by 7.6% in 1958, of which the production of means of production will increase by 8.3% and the production of consumer goods will increase by 6.1%.

    Accelerating the development of the chemical, petroleum and gas industries, and the ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgical industries, is the main task of the 1958 plan. To complete this task, we must make the greatest efforts and concentrate the maximum material and financial resources.

    It is stipulated that the development of the chemical industry must be greatly accelerated, and the investment in this sector will increase by 50% compared with 1957.

    Compared with 1957, oil production will increase by 14%, petroleum products will increase by 12%, and gas will increase by 52%. Investment in the oil and gas industries will increase by 30.5%.

    It is stipulated that coal production will increase by approximately 27 million tons. The plan is to put into production coal mines and open-pit coal mines with a total production capacity of more than 37 million tons in 1958.

    It is stipulated that 39.1 million tons of pig iron, 53.6 million tons of steel, and 41.7 million tons of steelÊùê will be produced. The investment in the ferrous metallurgical industry is determined to be 12.1 billion rubles. During the period of 1958-1959, the annual steel production capacity will increase by 6.5 million tons, which is equal to the total production capacity increased during the entire Fifth Five-Year Plan period. During the period of 1958-1959, the production capacity of iron ore will increase by approximately 35 million tons. This figure is more than twice the total iron ore mining volume of Sweden and the United Kingdom in 1955.

    In 1958, the foundation will be laid for the establishment of the new factory of the third huge metallurgical base - the West Siberian Metallurgical Factory.

    In 1958, it is stipulated that some power stations with a total power generation capacity of 5 million kilowatts will be put into production, and the construction of five new large thermal power stations will begin. The Soviet Union is also building some nuclear power stations with power generation capacities of 200,000 kilowatts to 400,000 kilowatts each, and some experimental power stations with new types of power reactors.

    The growth of electricity production next year is approximately 21.5 billion kilowatt-hours. The total electricity production for the whole year will be 231 billion kilowatt-hours.

    The tasks facing the machinery manufacturing industry are: to ensure the priority development of the chemical, petroleum and gas industries, and the ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgical industries, that is, those sectors of the national economy that are developing faster. The production of advanced machinery and equipment will also be increased. The production of trunk electric locomotives and internal combustion locomotives will be greatly increased. Some new machines that completely mechanize the basic production processes of crops and some new machines for the automobile industry will be manufactured.

    The new plan stipulates further increases in the output of light industry and food industry products. Cloth will increase by 75 million meters in one year, and leather shoes will increase by 28 million pairs. The total output of the meat and dairy industry will increase by 14%, and the output of sugar will increase by 18.2%.

    In agriculture, the main tasks for 1958 are to increase the yield per unit area and further increase the total output of grain, technical crops, vegetables and feed crops, and increase the output of meat, butter and milk. The reclamation of wasteland will continue. The total agricultural output will increase by 17% compared with 1957. The grain sown area will increase by more than 5 million hectares, with a total area of 130 million hectares.

    National agriculture will receive 155,000 tractors and 135,000 grain harvesting combines in 1958. The appropriation for basic agricultural construction and the addition of technical equipment is approximately 30 billion rubles, an increase of 2 billion rubles compared with 1957.

    The cargo turnover of the Soviet transportation industry will increase by 87.5 billion ton-kilometers in 1958, an increase of 6% compared with 1957. Investment in the development of railway transportation will increase by 20.5%, while investment in railway electrification will increase by nearly 40%. The total length of electrified railways to be opened to traffic will reach 1,684 kilometers.

    Kuzmin said that the wide use of jet aircraft and turboprop aircraft will make air ticket prices no higher than hard-seat train tickets. Therefore, in the next two or three years, air transport will become the main mode of passenger transport in the Soviet Union.

    State investment in 1958 is 198.8 billion rubles, almost 14 billion rubles more than in 1957. Accelerating housing construction is one of the most important tasks in the 1958 plan. The state's investment in this area is 36.8 billion rubles. In 1958, the Soviet Union will build 61 million square meters of housing, 13 million square meters more than in 1957.

    Kuzmin said that three-quarters of the total increase in industrial products in 1958 will be achieved by increasing labor productivity. In the industrial sector, labor productivity should increase by an average of 5.4%, and in the construction sector, it should increase by an average of 8.5%.

    According to the plan, the Soviet national income will increase by approximately 8% in 1958.

    The appropriation for social and cultural needs in the national budget is 212 billion rubles, almost 14 billion rubles more than in 1957. The retail trade volume is stipulated to be 660 billion rubles, an increase of 45 billion rubles compared with 1957. It is expected that the sales volume of refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, furniture, motorcycles and scooters will increase by 20% to 30%.

    It is stipulated to further expand the work of cultivating professionals with higher and secondary education. Next year, approximately 838,000 such professionals can be trained, 64,000 more than in 1957.

    The reporter listed the main indicators of the national economic development of each republic in 1958 according to the overall plan of the Soviet national economic development. He emphasized that next year will be an important milestone in the economic development of each republic. In the new year, the national economy of these republics will take a big leap forward.

    The 1958 national economic plan stipulates wide-ranging trade with foreign countries and the development of other forms of economic cooperation.
