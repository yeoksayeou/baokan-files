Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 20th: According to TASS, Kuzmin, Chairman of the Soviet State Planning Committee and First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, delivered a report on the 1958 Soviet National Economic Development Plan at the Supreme Soviet meeting in the Kremlin on the afternoon of the 19th.

    **Preliminary Results for This Year**
    Industrial production increased by 10%, total investment increased by more than 10%, animal husbandry has been fundamentally improved, and the Soviet Union occupies a leading position in scientific and technological progress.

    In his report, Kuzmin discussed the preliminary results of the implementation of the 1957 plan. He pointed out that all fifteen Soviet republics not only fulfilled their industrial production plans but also exceeded them. He also emphasized the enormous role played by the reorganization of industrial and construction management in this regard.

    According to preliminary data, the growth of Soviet industrial production in 1957 was 10%, while the original plan was 7.1%. The production of means of production will increase by approximately 11%, and the production of consumer goods will increase by more than 8%.

    Over the past year, Soviet steel production has increased by approximately 2 million tons, cement by nearly 4 million tons, coal mining by more than 33 million tons, oil extraction by 17%, and gas by 50%. Electricity production this year was 210 billion kilowatt-hours, more than 18 billion kilowatt-hours more than in 1956.

    Total state investment in the national economy increased by more than 10%. Labor productivity in the entire industrial sector increased by 6.5%, exceeding the target for increasing labor productivity.

    Speaking about the agricultural situation, the reporter emphasized that a new and huge agricultural production base has been established in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union. The situation in the previously backward animal husbandry has been fundamentally improved. In 1957, the number of cattle increased by 4 million, goats and sheep increased by more than 8 million, and pigs increased by 6 million.

    According to preliminary statistics, the national income will increase by 6% in 1957, and the actual income of workers and staff will also increase accordingly. The retail trade volume increased by 74 billion rubles in one year, totaling 615 billion rubles.

    Talking about the outstanding achievements of Soviet science and technology in 1957, Kuzmin said: Now, when a new scientific and technological revolution is taking place due to the acquisition and use of atomic energy, the development of rocket technology, and the automation of production, the Soviet Union occupies a leading position in scientific and technological progress.

    **Economic Planning Tasks for 1958**
    Formulated according to the seven-year long-term plan, it is predicted that the total industrial output will increase by 7.6%, the total agricultural output will increase by 17%, and state investment and national income will increase significantly.

    While explaining the tasks of the 1958 Soviet National Economic Plan, Kuzmin pointed out that this plan differs from the 1957 plan in many aspects in terms of its content, tasks, and formulation methods.

    An important feature of the 1958 plan is that its basic direction is based on the tasks stipulated in the seven-year long-term plan, a draft of which has already begun to be drafted.

    The formulation of the 1958 plan is adapted to the new management system of industry and construction; it stipulates better utilization of the natural and production resources of each republic and improvement of economic ties between republics.

    The 1958 plan only assigned tasks to the republics on the most important indicators.

    The plan stipulates that the total industrial output will increase by 7.6% in 1958, of which the production of means of production will increase by 8.3% and the production of consumer goods will increase by 6.1%.

    Accelerating the development of the chemical, petroleum and gas industries, and the ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgical industries, is the main task of the 1958 plan. To complete this task, we must make the greatest efforts and concentrate the maximum material and financial resources.

    It is stipulated that the development of the chemical industry must be greatly accelerated, and the investment in this sector will increase by 50% compared with 1957.

    Compared with 1957, oil production will increase by 14%, petroleum products will increase by 12%, and gas will increase by 52%. Investment in the oil and gas industries will increase by 30.5%.

    It is stipulated that coal production will increase by approximately 27 million tons. The plan is to put into production coal mines and open-pit coal mines with a total production capacity of more than 37 million tons in 1958.

    It is stipulated that 39.1 million tons of pig iron, 53.6 million tons of steel, and 41.7 million tons of steel材 will be produced. The investment in the ferrous metallurgical industry is determined to be 12.1 billion rubles. During the period of 1958-1959, the annual steel production capacity will increase by 6.5 million tons, which is equal to the total production capacity increased during the entire Fifth Five-Year Plan period. During the period of 1958-1959, the production capacity of iron ore will increase by approximately 35 million tons. This figure is more than twice the total iron ore mining volume of Sweden and the United Kingdom in 1955.

    In 1958, the foundation will be laid for the establishment of the new factory of the third huge metallurgical base - the West Siberian Metallurgical Factory.

    In 1958, it is stipulated that some power stations with a total power generation capacity of 5 million kilowatts will be put into production, and the construction of five new large thermal power stations will begin. The Soviet Union is also building some nuclear power stations with power generation capacities of 200,000 kilowatts to 400,000 kilowatts each, and some experimental power stations with new types of power reactors.

    The growth of electricity production next year is approximately 21.5 billion kilowatt-hours. The total electricity production for the whole year will be 231 billion kilowatt-hours.

    The tasks facing the machinery manufacturing industry are: to ensure the priority development of the chemical, petroleum and gas industries, and the ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgical industries, that is, those sectors of the national economy that are developing faster. The production of advanced machinery and equipment will also be increased. The production of trunk electric locomotives and internal combustion locomotives will be greatly increased. Some new machines that completely mechanize the basic production processes of crops and some new machines for the automobile industry will be manufactured.

    The new plan stipulates further increases in the output of light industry and food industry products. Cloth will increase by 75 million meters in one year, and leather shoes will increase by 28 million pairs. The total output of the meat and dairy industry will increase by 14%, and the output of sugar will increase by 18.2%.

    In agriculture, the main tasks for 1958 are to increase the yield per unit area and further increase the total output of grain, technical crops, vegetables and feed crops, and increase the output of meat, butter and milk. The reclamation of wasteland will continue. The total agricultural output will increase by 17% compared with 1957. The grain sown area will increase by more than 5 million hectares, with a total area of 130 million hectares.

    National agriculture will receive 155,000 tractors and 135,000 grain harvesting combines in 1958. The appropriation for basic agricultural construction and the addition of technical equipment is approximately 30 billion rubles, an increase of 2 billion rubles compared with 1957.

    The cargo turnover of the Soviet transportation industry will increase by 87.5 billion ton-kilometers in 1958, an increase of 6% compared with 1957. Investment in the development of railway transportation will increase by 20.5%, while investment in railway electrification will increase by nearly 40%. The total length of electrified railways to be opened to traffic will reach 1,684 kilometers.

    Kuzmin said that the wide use of jet aircraft and turboprop aircraft will make air ticket prices no higher than hard-seat train tickets. Therefore, in the next two or three years, air transport will become the main mode of passenger transport in the Soviet Union.

    State investment in 1958 is 198.8 billion rubles, almost 14 billion rubles more than in 1957. Accelerating housing construction is one of the most important tasks in the 1958 plan. The state's investment in this area is 36.8 billion rubles. In 1958, the Soviet Union will build 61 million square meters of housing, 13 million square meters more than in 1957.

    Kuzmin said that three-quarters of the total increase in industrial products in 1958 will be achieved by increasing labor productivity. In the industrial sector, labor productivity should increase by an average of 5.4%, and in the construction sector, it should increase by an average of 8.5%.

    According to the plan, the Soviet national income will increase by approximately 8% in 1958.

    The appropriation for social and cultural needs in the national budget is 212 billion rubles, almost 14 billion rubles more than in 1957. The retail trade volume is stipulated to be 660 billion rubles, an increase of 45 billion rubles compared with 1957. It is expected that the sales volume of refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, furniture, motorcycles and scooters will increase by 20% to 30%.

    It is stipulated to further expand the work of cultivating professionals with higher and secondary education. Next year, approximately 838,000 such professionals can be trained, 64,000 more than in 1957.

    The reporter listed the main indicators of the national economic development of each republic in 1958 according to the overall plan of the Soviet national economic development. He emphasized that next year will be an important milestone in the economic development of each republic. In the new year, the national economy of these republics will take a big leap forward.

    The 1958 national economic plan stipulates wide-ranging trade with foreign countries and the development of other forms of economic cooperation.

    今年的初步结果
    工业生产增长10％，投资总额增加了10％以上，畜牧业有了根本改善，科学技术进步方面占据领先地位。
    库兹明在报告中谈到1957年计划执行的初步结果。他指出，苏联十五个加盟共和国不仅全部完成了工业生产计划，而且还超额完成了。他还强调指出了工业和建设管理的改组在这方面所起的巨大作用。
    根据初步材料，1957年苏联工业生产的增长为10％，而原定计划为7.1％。生产资料的生产大约将增加11％，消费品的生产将增加8％以上。
    一年来，苏联钢材的生产量大约增加了二百万吨，水泥差不多增加了四百万吨，采煤量增加了三千三百万吨以上，石油开采量增加了17％，煤气增加了50％。这一年生产的电力是二千一百亿度，比1956年多一百八十多亿度。
    国家在国民经济方面的投资总额增加了10％以上。整个工业部门中的劳动生产率提高了6.5％，超额完成了提高劳动生产率的任务。
    报告人在谈到农业情况时强调指出，苏联东部地区建立了新的巨大的农业生产基地。过去落后的畜牧业的情况得到了根本改善。1957年牛的头数增加了四百万头，山羊和绵羊增加了八百多万头，猪增加了六百万头。
    根据初步统计，1957年国民收入将增加6％，职工的实际收入也相应地提高了。零售贸易额一年中增加了七百四十亿卢布，总数为六千一百五十亿卢布。
    谈到1957年苏联科学技术的卓越成就时，库兹明说：现在，当由于获得和使用原子能、发展火箭技术和生产自动化而发生新的科学技术革命的时候，苏联在科学技术进步方面占据了领先的地位。
    1958年经济计划任务
    根据七年远景计划制定，预定工业总产量增长7.6％，农业总产量增长17％，国家投资和国民收入均将大大增加。
    库兹明在说明1958年苏联国民经济计划的任务时指出，这个计划就其内容、任务和制订方法来说在许多方面不同于1957年的计划。
    1958年计划的重要特点在于它的基本方向是根据七年远景计划的任务规定的，这一远景计划的草案已经在开始草拟。
    1958年计划的制定适应于工业和建设的新管理体系；它规定更好地利用每个共和国的天然资源和生产资源，改进共和国间的经济联系。
    1958年计划只在最重要的指标上给加盟共和国规定了任务。
    计划规定，1958年工业总产量增长7.6％，其中生产资料的生产增长8.3％，消费资料的生产增长6.1％。
    加速发展化学、石油和煤气工业、黑色和有色冶金工业，是1958年计划的主要任务。完成这项任务必须尽最大努力，集中最大限度的物力和财力。
    规定大力加速发展化学工业，对这个部门的投资额将比1957年增加50％。
    同1957年比较，石油产量要增加14％、石油制品增加12％、煤气增加52％。石油工业和煤气工业的投资额将增加30.5％。
    规定煤产量增加约二千七百万吨。计划在1958年内有若干生产能力共超过三千七百万吨的煤井和露天采煤场投入生产。
    规定生产三千九百一十万吨生铁、五千三百六十万吨钢和四千一百七十万吨钢材。确定对黑色冶金工业的投资额为一百二十一亿卢布。在1958年—1959年期间，每年钢材的生产能力将增加六百五十万吨，这等于在整个第五个五年计划期间增加的生产能力的总和。在1958年—1959年期间，铁矿的生产能力将增加约三千五百万吨。这个数字等于1955年瑞典和英国铁矿开采量总和的两倍以上。
    在1958年，将为第三个巨大的冶金基地的新工厂——西西伯利亚冶金工厂的建立打下基础。
    在1958年内，规定有一些总发电能力为五百万瓩的发电站投入生产，并且要开始建造五个新的大型火力发电站。苏联还正在建造发电能力各为二十万瓩到四十万瓩的一些原子能发电站和一些带有新型动力反应堆的实验发电站。
    明年电力生产的增长约为二百一十五亿度。全年将总共生产二千三百一十亿度电。
    机器制造业所面临的任务是：保证首先发展化学、石油和煤气工业、黑色和有色冶金业，即国民经济中那些发展更快的部门。还将提高先进的机器设备的生产。将大大增产干线电气机车和内燃机车。将制造一些使农作物基本生产过程全盘机械化的新型机器以及制造汽车工业用的一些新型机器。
    新计划规定进一步增加轻工业和食品工业产品的产量。布匹在一年内将增加七千五百万公尺，皮鞋增加两千八百万双。肉类和制奶工业总产量将增加14％，糖的产量将增加18.2％。
    在农业方面，1958年的主要任务是提高单位面积产量和进一步增加谷物、技术作物、蔬菜和饲料作物的总产量，增加肉类、牛油和牛奶的产量。将继续开垦荒地。农业的总产量将比1957年增加17％。谷物播种面积将增加五百万公顷以上，总面积达一亿三千万公顷。
    全国农业在1958年将获得十五万五千台拖拉机、十三万五千台谷物收割联合机。在农业基本建设和增添技术设备方面的拨款约为三百亿卢布，比1957年增加了二十亿卢布。
    苏联运输业的货物周转量在1958年将增加八百七十五亿吨公里，比1957年增加6％。发展铁路运输方面的投资将增加20.5％，同时铁路电气化方面的投资增加将近40％。将要通车的电气化铁路总长度达一千六百八十四公里。
    库兹明说，喷气式飞机和涡轮螺旋桨式飞机的广泛使用，使飞机票价将不超过火车硬席票价。因此，在最近两、三年内，空运将成为苏联客运的主要方式。
    1958年国家投资是一千九百八十八亿卢布，几乎比1957年增加一百四十亿卢布。加速住宅建设是1958年计划中最重要的任务之一。国家在这方面的投资是三百六十八亿卢布。1958年苏联要建造六千一百万平方公尺的住宅，比1957年多一千三百万平方公尺。
    库兹明说，1958年全部工业产品的增长量中将有四分之三靠提高劳动生产率来取得。在工业部门中，劳动生产率应该平均提高5.4％，在建筑部门中应该平均提高8.5％。
    根据计划，1958年苏联国民收入大约增加8％。
    国家预算在社会文化需要方面的拨款是二千一百二十亿卢布，几乎比1957年增加一百四十亿卢布。零售贸易额规定是六千六百亿卢布，比1957年增加四百五十亿卢布。预计冰箱、吸尘器、洗衣机、家具、机器脚踏车和小轮摩托的出售量将增加20％至30％。
    规定进一步扩大培养具有高等和中等教育程度的专业人员的工作。明年可培养出这类专业人员约八十三万八千人，比1957年多六万四千人。
    报告人根据苏联国民经济发展的总计划列举了1958年各加盟共和国国民经济发展的主要指标。他强调指出，明年将是各加盟共和国经济发展的一个重要里程碑。在新的一年中，这些共和国的国民经济将大大跃进一步。
    1958年国民经济计划规定广泛地同外国进行贸易，并发展其他形式的经济合作。
