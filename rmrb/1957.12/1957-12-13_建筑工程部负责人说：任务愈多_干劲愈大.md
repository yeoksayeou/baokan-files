　　Head of the Ministry of Construction Engineering Says:
　　The More Tasks, the Greater the Enthusiasm
    This dispatch reports that adhering to the general construction policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" will allow us to be more confident in catching up with Britain in the output of major industrial products within fifteen years. This was stated to reporters by the head of the Ministry of Construction Engineering.
    This person in charge said: "More, faster, better, and more economical" is an inspiring slogan. This slogan can mobilize potential in all aspects, utilize favorable conditions in all aspects, and make up for weak links, giving us the confidence to achieve the slogan of "catching up with Britain in the output of major industrial products such as steel within fifteen years." This policy is even more essential for our construction industry. The more tasks we have, the greater our enthusiasm, so we feel very excited.
    Last year's achievements were indeed the main aspect. Taking our system as an example, we completed 60% more basic construction tasks than in 1955, and 31% more design tasks than in 1955. Many projects were completed ahead of schedule, and the quality was not bad. For example, many projects in the Xi'an area were put into production a year ahead of the original plan. The Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant, with an equipment capacity of 100,000 kilowatts, was built in only one year and one month, whereas it would normally take two years. Last year was the most intense year, but it was also the year with the most experience gained in industrial construction. Technical equipment, technical level, and the level of industrialized construction have all been greatly improved, and the construction of bases has also taken initial shape. This not only ensured the completion of the Five-Year Plan but also laid the foundation for over-fulfilling the Five-Year Plan. Without last year, this year would have been quite tense. Of course, in the implementation of the "more, faster, better, and more economical" policy last year, some shortcomings also arose, but they are insignificant compared to the achievements and only occupy a very secondary position. It is wrong to underestimate last year's achievements and develop passive and conservative emotions.
    This person in charge said: "More, faster, better, and more economical" is a comprehensive construction policy that must be taken care of in all aspects. Deviations will occur if only one aspect is considered. From our construction department's point of view, "more" and "faster" were achieved last year, but "better" and "more economical" were insufficient. Some quality accidents occurred, and waste was still quite serious in some places. Therefore, in the future, we must pay special attention to "better" and "more economical" in implementing this policy, and strive to do more and faster on the basis of "better" and "more economical." To achieve this, we must run enterprises diligently and thriftily, save all expenses, use various methods to reduce project costs, and take various measures to ensure good project quality.

### 建筑工程部负责人说：任务愈多　干劲愈大

　　建筑工程部负责人说：
　　任务愈多　干劲愈大
    本报讯　坚持执行多快好省的建设方针，就可以更有把握地在十五年内在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国。这是建筑工程部负责人对记者说的。
    这位负责人说：多快好省是个振奋人心的口号。这个口号可以动员各方面的潜力，可以利用各方面的有利条件，可以把薄弱环节补上，使我们有把握地实现在“十五年内在钢铁等主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国”这个口号。这个方针对于我们建筑业来说更感到切要，任务愈多，我们的干劲也愈大，因此我们很感到兴奋。
    去年一年，成绩确实是主要的。拿我们这个系统来说，基本建设任务比1955年多完成了60％，设计任务比1955年多完成了31％。许多工程项目提前完成，而且质量也不坏。如西安地区的许多工程进度都比原计划要提前一年投入生产。设备能力达十万瓩的兰州热电站只用了一年零一个月的时间就建成了，而按一般速度则需要两年。去年是最紧张的一年，但也是在工业建筑方面取得经验最多的一年，技术装备、技术水平、以及工业化施工水平都有很大提高，基地建设也已初具规模。这样，不仅保证了五年计划的完成，而且打下了超额完成五年计划的基础。如果没有去年一年，今年将是相当紧张的。当然，去年在执行多快好省的方针中，也产生过一些缺点，但比起成绩来是不足道的，只占很次要的地位。如果不适当地估计了去年的成绩而产生消极保守情绪是不对的。
    这位负责人说：多快好省是个全面的建设方针，必须全面照顾，只顾那一条都会出偏差。从我们建筑部门来说，去年一年多快是做到了，但好省还不足，出了一些质量事故，浪费现象在某些地方还相当严重。因此，我们今后在贯彻这个方针中要特别注意好和省，在好和省的基础上力求搞得多一些，快一些。要做到这一点，就要勤俭办企业，节约一切开支，用各种办法降低工程造价，采取各种措施，保证工程质量良好。
