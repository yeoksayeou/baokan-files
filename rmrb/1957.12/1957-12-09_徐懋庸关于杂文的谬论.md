Title: Xu Maoyong's Fallacies on Essays

Xu Maoyong wrote nearly a hundred essays in just half a year. Such an essay "writer" naturally has a set of essay "theories." At first glance, his essay "theories" are indeed quite charming. But peel back the skin, and it's all filth. Xu Maoyong admitted that he "eats soybeans, but farts" [Note]. I think a fart is only smelly and doesn't harm anyone, but what Xu Maoyong released was poisonous gas.

Having repeatedly made serious mistakes and been punished by the Party, Xu Maoyong harbored deep hatred for the Party and the new society. He knew that literature and art are weapons of class struggle, and essays are even more combative. He attempted to turn essays into "daggers" and "javelins" against the Party and the people. He said that essays are the street gossip of the masses, and "in today's China, it seems that leaders are least suited to use essays. When I was an 'official of the eighth rank,' the essay-like words I spoke correctly were far more resented by some people than the official-like words I spoke incorrectly. I later realized the reason for this was that people thought the words of 'officials' would determine their fate, while the words of the masses were insignificant. Therefore, once I left the position of 'official,' I could speak more freely..." Here, on the one hand, Xu Maoyong viciously portrayed today's senior cadres as "officials" of the old society, saying that they do not speak the truth, and inciting some people to attack leading cadres with essays. Xu Maoyong was "proud" that his essays were "very unwilling to only serve as penicillin for small cadres."

"'Lu Xun in the 'Essay Era' never ridiculed or attacked the revolutionary people and the revolutionary party." (Mao Zedong: "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art") But Xu Maoyong used essays to ridicule and attack the revolutionary people and the revolutionary party!

How did Xu Maoyong use essays to attack the Party and the people? He asked and answered himself: "Can satirists participate in revenge for the injustices they have suffered? I think they can..." But Xu Maoyong knew: "If I were to express my personal feelings to the fullest, it would be even more annoying," so he advocated: essays should be "subtle and roundabout in some places, leading readers to think repeatedly."

If people think that "subtle and roundabout" is just a matter of a certain author's style, then they will be fooled. Xu Maoyong's "subtle and roundabout" is one of his main methods of opposing the Party. In his nearly a hundred essays, especially the earlier ones, he either quoted Marxist phrases, or played with philosophical terms, or used historical knowledge, obscure and roundabout, leading readers to think repeatedly, and as a result, instilled anti-Marxist and anti-Party and anti-people ideas into readers without revealing his true colors. Xu Maoyong's essays were initially "subtle and roundabout," which did fool some people. This is his viciousness.

"Subtle and roundabout" is a matter of essay writing technique. However, "subtle and roundabout," in different situations, for different authors with different positions, has different purposes and effects. We say that in the people's era, the revolutionary essays of revolutionary essay writers can be written more clearly. Lu Xun in the era of dark rule used many "circuitous strokes," which was inevitable for Lu Xun. Flowers and plants under stones must grow crookedly if they are to survive and develop. But Lu Xun's essays were always "daggers" and "javelins" thrown at the enemy. Therefore, the fundamental issue of essays still lies in the position of the essay writer and the ideological content of the essay.

Xu Maoyong said that essays should "tell the truth," "start from the truth," be sharp, and "have a little life, a little thought, and a little art, and can also have a little science, and should also have their own style." Also: "Add a little knowledge that is not necessarily known to everyone." Here, there is no mention of the issue of position, and as a result, the previous "theories" can be understood and applied from different angles. Every author has a position, and Xu Maoyong is no exception. His position is that of a bourgeois rightist, but he does not explicitly say so.

Good essay writers should have literary color and rich social, historical, scientific, and literary knowledge. But literary color and rich knowledge can only be entrusted under the guidance of the proletarian standpoint and correct thought. The reason why Lu Xun's essays are indestructible is first and foremost rooted in his proletarian stance and its correct and profound ideological content. On this premise, coupled with his superb literary cultivation and rich knowledge, his essays are even more brilliant. Otherwise, like Xu Maoyong, standing on the reactionary position of a bourgeois rightist, even if he has a little "knowledge," a little "art," a little "science," or even a little "knowledge that everyone may not know," he is still an anti-Party vanguard!

    徐懋庸关于杂文的谬论
    岳军
    徐懋庸在短短的半年时间里，写了近百篇杂文。这样的杂文
  “作家”，自然会有一套杂文“理论”的。他的杂文“理论”，乍看之下，着实迷人得很。但剥开皮来，却尽是脏东西。徐懋庸自认他“吃的是大豆，而放出来的却是屁”〔注〕。我以为，屁也不过是臭，害不得人的，而徐懋庸放出来的却是毒瓦斯。
    一再犯了严重的错误、受到党的处分的徐懋庸，对党和新社会有着刻骨仇恨。他深知文艺是阶级斗争的武器，杂文更富于战斗的特性。他企图把杂文变成反党反人民的“匕首”和“投枪”。他说，杂文是群众的街谈巷议，在“现在的中国，似乎领导人最不宜于用杂文。我在当‘八品文官’的时候，讲得对的杂文式的话，比起讲得错的官话式的话来，远远地更为有些人们所切齿。我后来才悟得了其中的道理，是在于人们以为‘官’的话是解决他们的命运的，而群众的话，则无足轻重。所以，我一脱离了‘官’的地位，讲话就可以自由些了……。”这里，徐懋庸一方面恶毒地把今天的高级干部形容成旧社会的“官”，说他们不讲真话，挑拨领导干部和群众的关系；一方面煽动有些人以杂文攻击领导干部。徐懋庸便是以他的杂文“很不愿意只给小干部充当盘尼西林”为“骄傲”的。
    “‘杂文时代’的鲁迅，也不曾嘲笑和攻击革命人民和革命政党。”（毛泽东：“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”）而徐懋庸却用杂文嘲笑和攻击革命的人民和革命的政党！
    徐懋庸怎样用杂文来攻击党和人民呢？他自问自答道：“讽刺者可不可以参入对自己所受的不平的报复？我以为，也可以，……。”但徐懋庸自知：“如把我亲自的所感尽情说出来，那就更讨人厌”了，所以他主张：杂文“有的地方要委婉曲折，引得读者反复去想”。
    如果人们以为“委婉曲折”只是某个作者的风格问题，那就要上当了。徐懋庸的“委婉曲折”，正是他反党的主要手法之一。他的近百篇杂文中，特别是先前的几篇，或摘引马克思主义词句，或耍弄哲学名词，或搬用历史知识，隐晦曲折，引得读者反复去想，结果给读者灌输了反马克思主义和反党反人民的思想而不露马脚。徐懋庸杂文的“委婉曲折”，当初着实使一些人上了当的。这正是他的恶毒之处。
    “委婉曲折”，是杂文的笔法问题。然而“委婉曲折”，在不同情况下，在不同立场的不同作者，有着不同的目的和效果。我们说，人民的时代，革命的杂文作者的革命的杂文，可以写得明快些。黑暗统治年代的鲁迅，用了很多“曲笔”，这在鲁迅是不得不然。石头下的花草，若要生存、发展，非弯弯曲曲地生长不可的。但鲁迅杂文，始终是投向敌人的“匕首”和“投枪”。所以，杂文的根本问题，仍在杂文作者的立场、杂文的思想内容。
    徐懋庸说，杂文要“讲实话”、要“从真理出发”、要锋利、要“有点儿生活，有点儿思想，还有点儿艺术，也可以有点儿科学，而且，还应当有自己的风格。”还要：“加一点未必是大家知道的知识”。这儿独独没有立场问题，结果前面的那些“理论”，便可以从不同的角度去理解、去运用。每个作者都是有立场的，徐懋庸也不例外。他的立场就是资产阶级右派的立场，不过他不便明说罢了。
    好的杂文作者，要有文学色彩，要有丰富的社会、历史、科学、文学的知识。但文学色彩、丰富的知识，只在无产阶级立场上、正确思想的指导下，才能有所寄托。鲁迅杂文之所以颠扑不破，首先就植根于他的无产阶级立场，它的正确而深刻的思想内容。在这前提下，加上他的高超的文学修养和丰富的知识，便使他的杂文更丰采焕发了。否则，像徐懋庸那样，站在资产阶级右派的反动立场上，即便有点儿“知识”、有点儿“艺术”、有点儿“科学”，甚至有点儿“大家未必知道的知识”，却还是一个反党急先锋！
