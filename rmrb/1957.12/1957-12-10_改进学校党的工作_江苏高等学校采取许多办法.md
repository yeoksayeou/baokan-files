Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 9th: The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Party committees of various higher education institutions in Jiangsu are recently adopting various measures to improve Party work. More than 50 leading cadres selected by the Provincial Committee's Department of Culture and Education are successively going to relevant schools to serve as Party committee secretaries, general branch secretaries, and other positions. The organizations of the Party committees in various schools are being adjusted and strengthened in conjunction with streamlining the institutions. Many leading cadres are directly in charge of specific work. In nine schools, Party committee secretaries who also held concurrent administrative positions as vice presidents have now been reassigned as full-time deputy Party committee secretaries.

In the process of improving Party work, various schools are paying particular attention to strengthening the Party's grassroots organizations. Throughout the province's higher education institutions, 53 departments and sections have established Party general branch committees. In addition to the cadres transferred by the Provincial Committee, various schools have also drawn a group of core members from the Party committees to be assigned to the departments to strengthen the general branch organizations. Nanjing University previously had three department-level general branches without leaders, and now general branch secretaries and other cadres have been successively assigned. Some school Party committee secretaries and deputy secretaries are directly concurrently serving or have been assigned to general branches as secretaries. The Party committee of Nanjing Institute of Technology has assigned six deputy secretaries, department heads, and Party committee members to the departments to serve as general branch secretaries, and has also assigned a group of Party member cadres to take on other work in the department general branches. Over 300 branches in various schools are also gradually strengthening their leadership. Some branches have re-elected their leaders, while others have established full-time secretaries.

During the rectification campaign, the Party committees of various schools have also actively improved their style of work in various aspects to ensure that Party cadres at all levels go deep among the masses. Nanjing Agricultural College has stipulated that Party committee secretaries and standing committee members regularly participate in teachers' and students' study sessions and lectures, receive visits from the masses, and other activities every month. Beginning this semester, cadres such as the Youth League committee and student Party branch secretaries must also practice "five togethers" with the students (eat together, live together, work together, labor together, and participate in cultural and sports activities) to strengthen the connection between the Party and the masses.

　　改进学校党的工作
　　江苏高等学校采取许多办法
    新华社南京9日电　中共江苏省委和江苏各高等学校党委会最近正采取各种措施改进党的工作。省委文教部选调的五十多名领导骨干，正陆续去有关学校，分别担任党委书记、总支书记等职务。各校党委会的组织都在结合紧缩机构，进行调整和加强，许多领导骨干都直接掌握具体工作，有九个学校兼职的党委书记和原来在行政上担任副院长职务的党员，现在改任党委专职副书记。
    各校改进党的工作中，特别注意加强党的基层组织。全省高等学校有五十三个系、科已分别成立党的总支委员会。除省委调去的干部以外，各校也从党委会抽调一批骨干，下放到系里充实总支组织。南京大学原有三个系总支没有负责人，现在已陆续派了总支书记和其他干部。有的学校党委书记、副书记直接兼任或下放到总支，担任书记。南京工学院党委会把六个副书记、部长和党委委员下放到系里担任总支书记，并且下放了一批党员干部担任系总支的其他工作。各校三百多个支部也在逐步加强领导，有的支部改选了负责人，有的设了专职书记。
    各校党委会在整风中还从各方面积极改进作风，保证各级党的干部深入群众。南京农学院规定党委书记和常委委员等每月定期参加教师、学生的学习和听课，接待群众来访等活动；这一学期开始，团委和学生党支部书记等干部还要做到和学生“五同”（同吃、同住、同工作、同劳动、同文娱体育），以加强党和群众的联系。
