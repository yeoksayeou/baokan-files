　　Learning to Farm for the First Time
    Sun Shuqing
    I spent half the morning cutting grass, and my back was a little sore. In the afternoon, I went to the newly reclaimed land on the hillside north of the village to plant broad beans. The land was plowed by oxen, so there was no need to dig it up again. After the bean seeds were scattered, they were covered with a hoe.

    Next to us, an old man was plowing the land with a large water buffalo. I watched him hold the plow with his left hand and the whip with his right, plowing furrow after furrow, relaxed and happy, as if he wasn't using much effort. I walked over and said:
    "Old man, can I try it?"
    "Can you do it?" He smiled, looking unsure, but he was too polite to refuse.
    "Let me try."

    I took the plow handle with a mix of nervousness and excitement, as this was my first time ever. Somehow, as soon as the plow was in my hand, it jumped up as if it had a spring, and the water buffalo dragged it along. I was so scared that my heart was pounding, but I didn't dare let go. The old man calmly took the plow from my hand and said gently:
    "You need to lift the plow a little higher to plow properly."

    Of course, I had been desperately trying to push the plow down when I first took it, causing the plowshare to tilt upwards, no wonder it jumped.

    Lao Luan, who came to the countryside with me, also came up. He joked, "I've never seen a plowman need a cattle driver," and he took the whip, saying to the old man, "I've plowed before, let me try it."

    But he was no better than me. Once he had the plow in his hands, he staggered around like a drunk, refusing to be controlled.

    "How do you hold the plow so it doesn't fall over?" we asked the old man.
    "Use force when the plow goes down, hold it steady, don't lift it too high..." he taught us as he plowed.

    Learning from my previous experience with the jumping plow, as soon as the plow touched the ground, I desperately tried to lift it, afraid I wasn't lifting it high enough. As a result, the poor water buffalo struggled, bending its legs and unable to move forward. The plow just burrowed into the ground, and the plow handle was buried in the soil. At this point, several peasant brothers ran over. After pulling the plow out, they laughed and said:
    "If you whip it a couple more times, you'll ruin the plowshare."

    "The mountain land has a lot of weeds, it's not easy to plow; next spring, go to the flat land to plow, you can learn slowly," the old man comforted me. "It's difficult for university teachers to learn to farm. If you asked us to hold a pen, we wouldn't be able to hold it either."

    I looked at the old man with gratitude and shame, not knowing what to say.

### 第一次学耕田

　　第一次学耕田
    孙殊青
    上午割了半天草，腰有些酸痛。下午到村北山坡上新垦的地里去种蚕豆。地是用牛耕的，不用再刨，豆种撒上以后，再用锄头盖。
    在我们旁边，一位老大爷在耕地，用一头大水牛。我看他左手扶犁，右手执鞭，一垅垅耕，轻松愉快，好像是不大用力。我走过去说：
    “老大爷，让我试试好吧？”
    “你行吗？”他笑了笑，看样子是不放心；可是又不好意思拒绝。
    “试试吧。”
    我怀着紧张而又兴奋的心情去接犁把，这还是有生以来第一次。不知怎么样的，犁刚到手，就像长了弹簧似的一下子跳了起来，大水牛拖着就跑。我吓得心直跳，又不敢丢。那位老大爷不慌不忙从我手里把犁接过去，很温和地说：
    “犁子要稍微抬高一些，才能耕得下去。”
    是呵，刚才我接过犁子拚命往下用力，犁头往上翘，还能不长弹簧。
    一起下乡的老栾也跟了上来。他开玩笑地说：“没见过耕田还要个赶牛的”，他把鞭子拿过去，对那位老大爷说：“我过去耕过田，还是让我试试吧。”
    谁知他并不比我高明，犁子到手，就像喝醉似的，东倒西歪，不听指挥。
    “到底怎样扶犁，才不倒？”我们向老大爷请教。
    “下犁用力，端稳，不能抬的太高……”他一面耕，一面教我们。
    我接受上次跳犁的教训，犁一下地，就猛力往上抬，唯恐抬的不够高。谁知这一来，可苦了大水牛，它累弯了腿也不能前进一步。犁子只往地下钻，犁把都被泥土埋了起来。这时，好几位农民兄弟都跑了上来。他们把犁子拿出以后，笑着说：
    “你再抽两鞭，犁头都要拉毁。”
    “山地毛草多，不好耕；明年开春到平地上去耕，慢慢可以学会。”老大爷安慰我，“大学的老师学耕田，那能没有困难。要我们拿笔杆，也拿不住。”
    我用感激、羞愧的目光望着老大爷，不知说什么好。
