    Changing Old Customs, Eradicating Bad Habits
    Ji Wei
    To build mountainous areas, one must have the heroic spirit of overturning mountains and seas, but also the persevering spirit of changing customs and habits.
    The spirit of the people in mountainous areas to overturn mountains and seas has already broken through countless ancient customs and habits, not only rapidly changing the natural landscape of mountainous areas, but also changing the spiritual outlook of the people in mountainous areas.
    However, there are still many outdated customs and habits, some views, sayings, and practices that have been passed down from generation to generation, which are still restricting the heroic spirit of the people in mountainous areas, delaying some things that should be done and can be done now; few people do them, and even few people think about them.
    In Hanzhong Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, 93% of the area is mountainous. The Qinling Mountains and Daba Mountains surround the Hanzhong Basin. There, the mountains are high, the water is high, and there are many gullies and rivers. Not only the plains are rice paddies, but also the mountain gullies are rice paddies, and there are rice paddies on the slopes and tops of the mountains. The Majiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Sanhuashi Township, Chazhen District, Xixiang County, has an earthen mountain that is twenty or thirty zhang high. Forty-three layers of paddy fields have been built from the bottom of the mountain to the top. An eight-li long water weir (canal) draws the spring water from the end of the deep gully to the high mountain, and this mountain head with an area of two to three hundred mu has been completely converted into paddy fields. Now they also light carbide lamps at night to process, repair weirs, and dig ponds, determined to completely transform another five to six hundred mu of mountain head into paddy fields. In such areas, the conditions for water conservancy movements are good, the enthusiasm is high, and the achievements are great. Shouldn't there be any major problems? No, there are still very important issues that deserve attention. The problem also lies in customs and habits. The custom here is either to build paddy fields and plant rice, or to plant dry land without watering; in times of drought, on the one hand, there are waterlogged paddy fields, and on the other hand, there is dry dry land. They would rather carry a load of water to save a few seedlings that are about to die of thirst than dig a gap in the nearby canal and build a small ditch to irrigate the dry land once. Why is this? Because the custom here is not to build water for irrigating the land; their traditional saying is: "Watering will cause the soil to harden," "One watering leads to three failures." Here, the meaning of water land is only paddy field, terraced fields are only layers of paddy fields, and the only goal of water conservancy efforts is to increase paddy fields and grow more rice. As a result, there is a large "price scissors" in the harvest of crops here: the average yield of paddy fields is five or six hundred jin per mu, the yield of dry land is one or two hundred jin per mu, the highest yield of paddy fields is more than one thousand two hundred jin per mu, and the lowest yield of dry land is only forty or fifty jin per mu. The total income of agriculture and sideline industries in Majiazhuang is very high. Each working day last year was one yuan, and this year it is nine jiao. In Xixiang County, it is the cooperative with the highest labor day remuneration in the county, with an annual income of more than one hundred yuan per person (including household sideline). However, the average yield per mu of this cooperative, adding paddy fields and dry land together, is less than three hundred jin. This is a rich shallow mountainous area south of the Qinling Mountains. According to the forty articles of the National Agricultural Development Program, the yield per mu should be eight hundred jin. The people of Majiazhuang are full of confidence in increasing the yield per mu of paddy fields to eight hundred jin, or even more than one thousand jin, in the short term, but raising the dry land to the level of eight hundred jin makes them frown, as if they can't think of a solution. We repeatedly suggested to them the idea of building water to irrigate the land, but it seems that they have not completely figured it out. Whenever water irrigation is mentioned, they say: "If there is water, raise the field (level the land and build it into a paddy field)". Their determination to turn all land with water into paddy fields is admirable. However, building paddy fields is much more labor-intensive than building water for irrigation. After the canals and ponds are built, according to the conditions there, it takes an average of one hundred and twenty to thirty working days to raise one mu of paddy field, and it only takes twenty to thirty working days to build one mu of water-irrigated land. This winter and next spring, the newly built canals and ponds in their cooperative can turn 670 mu of hillside land into paddy fields based on the terrain and water volume, but according to the cooperative's labor conditions, only 80 mu can be raised this winter and next spring, which means that there are still 590 mu that cannot be turned into paddy fields next year and will continue to grow dry land. If these canals and ponds use the abundant water source and take advantage of the excellent terrain for building paddy fields, can't the yield of wheat and corn be greatly increased next year if some water-irrigated land is built before it can be built into paddy fields all at once? Why should the increase in the cooperative's grain only rely on the eldest son (rice) to earn more, and not rely on the second son (wheat) and the third son (corn) to earn more too? The cooperative currently has more than 550 mu of rice, and more than 1,120 mu of wheat and corn. Isn't building a platform between dry land and paddy fields - building some water-irrigated land - a feasible way to increase production at present? The question of whether or not to build water-irrigated land has been raised. Whether Majiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative can break through old habits is a key to whether they can make a great leap forward.
    Building water for irrigation has not only formed a movement in the plains, but also in Shangluo Prefecture, which has roughly the same natural conditions as Hanzhong Prefecture. However, in Hanzhong Prefecture, it is still a relatively common problem that needs to be solved urgently. Everyone is wholeheartedly enthusiastic about building paddy fields (efforts to increase paddy fields are necessary; some areas only pay attention to water irrigation and not to building paddy fields. In this regard, the spirit of Hanzhong Prefecture in building paddy fields is worth learning), but from the leadership to the masses, they have not paid attention to water irrigation, which shows the stubbornness of habitual forces. Is there really no water irrigation in Hanzhong Prefecture? We have already inquired about two places, also in Xixiang County, which are Xixiang County Farm and Lianhua Agricultural Cooperative under its influence. Xixiang County Farm started diverting water for irrigation in 1955. This year, the farm's 43.25 mu of wheat harvested an average of 364 jin per mu because of winter irrigation and spring irrigation, of which 11.6 mu yielded 608 jin per mu, and 7.2 mu yielded 810 jin per mu, while this year the wheat in Xixiang County generally suffered a reduction in production due to drought, with an average yield of only 177 jin per mu. There is a Lianhua Agricultural Cooperative near this county farm. Comrade Xi Fasheng, the secretary of the Party branch, is already fifty years old this year. Because he often goes to the farm to visit, he deeply feels the benefits of water irrigation. Last winter, there was a lack of rain, and he called on the cooperative members to carry out winter irrigation; however, many cooperative members opposed it, believing that "winter irrigation will cause the soil to harden and the summer grain production will be reduced." Seeing that universal winter irrigation was not feasible, he took the initiative to lead some people to irrigate 11 mu of rapeseed that was planted very late. At that time, the early-planted rapeseed had grown to seven inches high, and the late-planted rapeseed was only two inches high. However, during the summer harvest this year, these 11 mu of irrigated rapeseed yielded 144 jin per mu; other rapeseed, the early-planted yielded 130 jin, and the late-planted yielded only 40 jin; the average yield of rapeseed in the entire cooperative was 123 jin per mu. Faced with this vivid fact, Lianhua Cooperative launched a major debate in late September this year when preparing to sow rapeseed, not only affirming that rapeseed should be planted (because many people thought that planting rapeseed was not cost-effective), but also affirming that irrigation should be carried out. This year, the superiors planned for the cooperative to plant 370 mu of rapeseed, but it planted 385 mu, and decided to carry out universal winter irrigation this year.
    The water irrigation of Xixiang Farm has broken the old habit of not building water for irrigation. This spark has already spread to the nearby Lianhua Agricultural Cooperative. The leading comrades of the Xixiang County Party Committee have already paid attention to this small spark. If they actively fan the flames from the leadership, it will burn faster and bigger.
    The habit of not building water for irrigation in the Hanzhong area is an old habit that has been passed down for a long time and is a bad habit that hinders the development of production. There are many such old habits in mountainous areas, such as the Yan'an area not building toilets and being accustomed to defecating in the mountains and fields; the Shangluo area not raising large cattle, saying that large cattle cannot climb mountains; the Hanzhong and Shangluo areas are not accustomed to raising donkeys and horses, and do not train cattle to carry manure. When people are laboriously carrying manure up the mountains, the cattle are leisurely eating grass while wagging their tails, resulting in insufficient fertilization of the mountains. These old habits directly hinder production, and these old habits can also be changed. The masses in Shangluo Prefecture said that large cattle cannot climb mountains. In fact, the Yan'an area is also a mountainous area, and the cattle there are about half as large as the cattle in Shangluo, and they can still climb steep slopes of forty or fifty degrees. The problem lies in the fact that there must be advanced figures in animal husbandry who dare to break old traditions. Xu Guangxing, who attended the Yan'an Prefecture Advanced Producers and Advanced Workers Conference last December, is a model inseminator in Wuqi County. His father was a good inseminator in the old society. The old society looked down on the profession of inseminator and did not allow inseminators to respect their ancestors during the Spring Festival, saying that they "lost their ancestors." Although Xu Guangxing learned insemination from his father, he still did not get rid of the influence of that habitual force in the early days of liberation. Traditional views and sayings such as "I would rather starve to death than be an inseminator" and "Inseminators are the dirtiest and cannot enter the ancestral hall" made him unwilling to inherit his father's profession at first. In 1953, the local Party organization called for the large-scale development of animal husbandry. The government knew that he could inseminate and asked him to do insemination work. After a serious ideological struggle, he made up his mind. He thought: "If we don't pay attention to the insemination of draft animals, every livestock will be as small as a hairy egg, and we can pick it up with a hug. We can't even pull a small plow, let alone pull large-scale new-style farm tools?" "Breeding livestock is an important thing to improve the lives of our people in mountainous areas. If everyone is unwilling to be an inseminator, wouldn't we be cutting off the offspring of livestock?" When he pulled a stud horse back home with the government's help, he was opposed by his family. His wife said: "Look how dirty you are!" His son said: "You're doing this low-down thing again!" His father also scolded him. The masses said: I would rather plant land for the rest of my life than do "this kind of thing"; the children also mocked him, calling out when they saw him: The old man who leads the stud horse is here! He felt very uncomfortable, but he said to the masses: "You dislike this and that, can your little foals fall from the sky?" "Your donkeys, horses, and cattle are very small when they are young. The foals born after insemination are not big. Small livestock cannot pull new-style farm tools, let alone pick them up with a hug. How can we do a good job in farming?" He insisted on continuing and finally won the understanding of his family and the support of the masses. From 1953 to the end of last year, he inseminated more than 350 cattle, donkeys, and horses, with a conception rate of over 96%.
    This spirit of changing customs and habits is worth greatly promoting. At the Yan'an Prefecture Water Conservancy and Manure Accumulation Conference, which ended on November 20, it was debated whether the old habit of "no toilets for people and no pens for pigs" could be changed. The responsible cadres of some counties also said: "What if the masses don't go to shit after installing toilets?" In fact, in Luochuan County, Yan'an Prefecture, the Woli Village Production Team of the Star No. 1 Cooperative on the Loess Plateau, universally installed toilets and built pig pens during the Great Production Movement in 1953. Under the influence of this team's high output, many pigs, and good hygiene, a major debate on the issue of manure accumulation in the entire cooperative in October this year was victorious. The old habit of "no toilets for people and no pens for pigs" has been broken, and the new habit of "every family has a toilet and every household has a pig pen" has been established. Comrade Xu Ziyou, secretary of the Yan'an Prefectural Committee, especially pointed out in his concluding report at this meeting: "Insufficient fertilization is a common and serious problem in our region's current agricultural production. Now we are faced with such facts: on the one hand, many places have no toilets for people and no pens for pigs, and a large amount of fertilizer is wasted; on the other hand, many fields are not fertilized, and crops are generally under-fertilized, resulting in unstable grain yields and slow growth in unit area yields. Faced with such facts, there are two attitudes: one is to actively reverse this situation with a revolutionary spirit; the other is to passively accommodate the habits of the masses and be overwhelmed by habitual forces. Obviously, the latter attitude is extremely wrong." He also said: "Since manure accumulation has been an old problem for many years, why have we not done it well? The key problem is that we have not made up our minds for a long time, have not taken resolute measures, and have not mobilized the masses. Some people think that manure accumulation cannot be done well, and that there are insurmountable difficulties in objective reality. This understanding is certainly wrong. However, we cannot underestimate the objective difficulties. As an old problem that has not been solved for a long time, we must have sufficient mental preparation, make up our minds, and do arduous work. Here, the so-called determination is to have the spirit of changing customs and habits, and to change the bad habits of peasants for thousands of years."
    Building mountainous areas requires this spirit of changing customs and habits. Changing old customs, eradicating bad habits, changing those traditional sayings and practices that hinder production, eliminating the spiritual shackles of the people in mountainous areas, and thoroughly liberating the heroic revolutionary spirit of the people in mountainous areas!

    移旧风　易坏俗
    季委
    建设山区要有排山倒海的英雄气魄，也要有移风易俗的坚韧精神。
    山区人民那股排山倒海的劲头，已经冲破了不知多少古老的风俗习惯，不只迅速改变着山区的自然面貌，也改变着山区人民的精神面貌。
    但是，仍然有不少陈旧的风俗习惯，一些代代相传习以为常的看法、说法和作法，还束缚着山区人民那股排山倒海的劲头，使一些应该办、现在又可以办的事情，推迟下来；很少人去作、甚至很少人去想。
    在陕西省的汉中专区，93％的面积是山区，秦岭山脉和大巴山脉包围着汉中盆地，那里山高水高、沟多河多，不只川地是稻田，山沟是稻田，山坡山顶也有稻田。西乡县茶镇区三花石乡的马家庄农业社，有一座二三十丈高的土山，从山底到山顶修成了四十三层水田，一条八里长的水堰（水渠）把深沟尽头的泉水引上了高山，这个面积两三百亩的山头就完全水田化了。现在他们晚上也点着汽灯加工修堰挖塘，决心把另一个五六百亩的山头完全变为水田。在这样的地区，水利运动的条件好、劲头足、成绩大，就该没有什么大问题了吗？不，仍然有很值得注意的重大问题。问题也就出在风俗习惯上。这里的习惯是要么就修水田种稻子，要么就种旱地不浇水；天旱的时候，一方面是水汪汪的稻田，一方面是干巴巴的旱地。他们宁肯一担一担地担一点水去救济少数渴得快死的青苗，也不把临近的水渠挖一个口、修一条小水沟，把旱地浇灌一次。这是为什么呢？因为这里的习惯就是不修水浇地；他们的传统说法是：“浇了要板结”，“一浇三不收”。在这里，水地的含义只是水田，梯田只是一层一层的水田，兴修水利的努力目标只有一个，就是增加水田多种水稻。结果，这里农作物的收获量就形成很大的“剪刀差”，稻田平均亩产五六百斤，旱地亩产一二百斤，稻田的最高亩产量一千二百多斤，旱地最低亩产只有四五十斤。这个马家庄的农副业总收入很高，每个劳动日去年一元，今年九角，在西乡县来说，是全县劳动日报酬最高的社，每人每年收入（包括家庭副业）在一百元以上。但是这个社的平均亩产量，拿水田和旱地加在一起一平均，还不到三百斤。这里是秦岭以南的富裕的浅山区，按照农业发展纲要四十条的规定，亩产量应该是八百斤。使水田的亩产量在短期内提高到八百斤，甚至千斤以上，马家庄的人民都满有把握，但是要把旱地提高到八百斤的水准，就使得他们皱着眉头，好像想不出办法。我们向他们再三提出修水浇地的意见，看起来还没有完全想通。一提水浇地，他们就说：“有水就抬田（把地抬平修成稻田）”，他们那种把一切有水的土地都变成水田的决心，是很值得敬佩的。只是，修水田要比修水浇地费工得多，把水渠和水塘修成以后，按照他们那里的条件，抬一亩水田平均要花一百二三十个劳动日，修一亩水浇地就只要二三十个劳动日。今冬明春，他们社新修的水渠和水塘，按地势和水量来估计，可以使六百七十亩山坡地变为稻田，但是按社里劳动力的条件，今冬明春只能抬田八十亩，就是说还有五百九十亩明年变不成稻田，还要继续种旱地。如果用这些水渠和水塘的丰富的水源，利用可以修水田的优良的地势，在不能一下修成稻田以前，先修一些水浇地，明年的麦子和玉米的产量不是可以大大提高吗？增加社里的粮食，为什么只靠大儿子（水稻）多挣，不靠二儿子（小麦）和三儿子（玉米）也多挣一些呢？该社现有水稻五百五十多亩，小麦和玉米就有一千一百二十多亩。难道在旱地和水田中间搭一个台阶——修一些水浇地，不是目前可行的增产办法吗？应不应该修水浇地的问题已经被提出来了。马家庄农业社能不能冲破旧习惯，就是他们能不能大大跃进的一个关键。
    修水浇地，不只在平原地区已经形成了运动，就是在和汉中专区自然条件大体相同的商?专区，也形成了运动。但是在汉中专区，还是一个比较普遍存在的急需解决的问题，大家只是全力以赴地热心于修水田（努力增加水田，这是应该的；有些地区只注意水浇地，不注意修水田，在这一点上，汉中专区修水田的精神就值得学习），但是从领导到群众都没有重视水浇地，可见习惯势力的顽强。难道在汉中专区真的没有水浇地吗？我们已经打听到两处，也是在西乡县，那是西乡县农场和在它影响下的莲花农业社。西乡县农场在1955年就开始引水浇地。今年农场的四十三亩二分五厘小麦，因为进行了冬灌和春灌，每亩平均收获三百六十四斤，其中有十一亩六分亩产达六百零八斤，有七亩二分亩产达八百零一十斤，而今年西乡全县麦子因旱普遍减产，平均亩产才一百七十七斤。这个县农场的附近有一个莲花农业社，党支部书记席发盛同志今年已经五十岁了，他因为常到农场去参观，深深感到水浇地的好处。去年冬天缺雨，他号召社员进行冬灌；但是很多社员反对，认为“冬灌要板结，夏粮要减产”。他见普遍冬灌行不通，就自己动手带领一些人把十一亩点种很迟的油菜灌了一下。当时种得早的油菜已经长到七寸高，这些迟种的油菜才二寸多。但是今年夏收时节，这十一亩灌过的油菜亩产一百四十四斤；其他油菜，种得早的收一百三十斤，种得迟的只收四十多斤；全社油菜平均亩产一百二十三斤。对于这个活生生的事实，莲花社在今年9月下旬准备播种油菜时展开了大辩论，不只肯定了应该种油菜（因为有不少人认为种油菜不合算），而且肯定应该进行灌溉。今年上级计划该社种油菜三百七十亩，结果种了三百八十五亩，而且决定今年普遍冬灌。
    西乡农场的水浇地，打破了不修水浇地的老习惯，这点星星之火，已经燃到附近的莲花农业社。西乡县委的领导同志对这点小小的火种已经注意，如果从领导上积极地煽风吹火，它就会烧得更快更大。
    汉中地区不修水浇地的习惯是长期传下来的旧习惯，是妨碍生产发展的坏习惯。像这样的旧习惯在山区还有很多，比如延安专区不安厕所、习惯在山野里大小便；商?专区不养大牛，说牛大爬不上山；汉中和商?专区不习惯养驴马，又不训练牛驮粪，当人们在吃力地背粪上山的时候，牛们却在旁边甩着尾巴悠闲地吃草，结果山地普遍施肥不足。这些老习惯都直接妨害着生产，这些老习惯也都是可以改变的。商?专区的群众说大牛爬不上山，其实在汉中和延安专区也是山区，那里的牛比商?的牛大一半左右，一样能爬上四五十度的陡坡。问题在于在牧畜业方面要有敢于打破旧传统的先进人物。延安专区就出现了这样一个战胜陈旧的风俗习惯的人。他叫许光兴，曾经出席延安专区去年12月召开的先进生产者和先进工作者大会，他是吴旗县的模范民桩（配种员）。他的父亲在旧社会时是一个配种的好把式，旧社会看不起民桩这行职业，过春节时也不让民桩敬祖先，说“丢了先人”。许光兴虽然跟父亲学会了配种，解放初期他仍然没摆脱那种习惯势力的影响，“那怕饿断肠，也不做民桩”、“民桩最肮脏，不得进祠堂”等等传统的看法和说法，使他开始也不愿意继承他父亲的职业。1953年当地党组织号召大量发展牧畜业，政府知道他会配种，要求他作配种工作，他经过严重的思想斗争，才下定决心。他想：“不注意耕畜的配种，个个牲口小的像个毛蛋蛋，一抱就能抱起，连个小犁也拉不动，还说拉大型的新式农具？”“繁殖牲畜，这是提高我们山区人民生活的一项重要事情，人人都不愿搞民桩，难道叫牲口断种不成？”当他拉着政府帮助的一匹种马回家的时候，遭到一家人的反对。他媳妇说：“看把人脏死了！”他儿子说：“又干起这低答的事了！”他父亲也骂他。群众说：宁可种一辈子地也不干“这号儿事”；娃娃们也嘲笑他，见他就叫：牵儿马的老汉来了！他心里很难受，但他对群众说：“你们嫌这嫌那，难道你们的小马驹儿能从天上掉下来？”“你们的驴、马、牛，公子很小，配种后生下的驹子不大，小牲畜不要说拉新式农具，一抱都抱得起来，怎能把庄稼作好？”他坚持干下去，终于得到家里的谅解，得到群众的拥护。从1953年到去年年底，他一共配种牛、驴、马三百五十多头，受胎率在96％以上。
    这种移风易俗的战斗精神值得大大提倡。在11月20日结束的延安专区水利和积肥会议上，争论了“人无厕所猪无圈”的旧习惯能不能改变，有的县的负责干部还说：“安上厕所群众不去拉屎，怎办呀？”其实，就在延安专区的洛川县，黄土高原上的明星一社洼里村生产队，在1953年大生产运动的时候就普遍安了厕所修了猪圈。在这个队产量高、养猪多、卫生好的影响下，今年10月全社关于积肥问题的大辩论得到了胜利，“人无厕所猪无圈”的老习惯已经打破，“家家有厕所、户户有猪圈”的新习惯已经建立起来。延安地委书记徐子猷同志在这个会议的总结报告中特别提出：“施肥不足，是我区当前农业生产上一个普遍而严重的问题。现在在我们面前摆着这样的事实：一方面，许多地方人无厕所猪无圈，大量肥源白白流失，未被利用；另一方面，许多地里不施肥，农作物普遍施肥不足，粮食产量不稳定，单位面积产量增长缓慢。面对着这样的事实，有两种态度，一种是积极地以革命精神扭转这种局面；一种是消极地迁就群众习惯，为习惯势力所骇倒。显然，后一种态度是极端错误的。”他又说：“既然积肥是多少年来的老问题，为什么我们一直没有搞好？关键问题是长期以来我们没有下决心，没有采取坚决措施，没有把群众发动起来。有人认为积肥搞不起来，是在客观上存在着不可克服的困难。这种认识当然是不对的。但是，我们也不能低估客观困难。作为一个长期没有搞好的老问题来对待，我们必须有足够的精神准备，要下决心，要做艰苦的工作。在这里，所谓决心，就是要有移风易俗的精神，要把农民千百年来的不良习惯改变过来。”
    建设山区正是需要这种移风易俗的精神。移旧风，易坏俗，改变那些妨害生产的传统说法和作法，消除山区人民精神上的束缚，彻底解放山区人民那种排山倒海的革命的英雄主义的干劲！
