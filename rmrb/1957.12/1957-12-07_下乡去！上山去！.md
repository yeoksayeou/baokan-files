　　Going to the countryside! Going to the mountains!
　　Going to the countryside! Going to the mountains! – Responding to the Party’s call: To send hands that only know how to hold pens to transplant rice seedlings, support plows, wield hoes and manipulate sickles! To let the thoughts and feelings of intellectuals bask in the sun and take a bath, to completely sun to death the germs of individualism, and to wash away the filth of selfishness and self-interest! Going to the countryside! Going to the mountains! – Responding to the Party’s call: To participate in the revolution once again, to thoroughly transform ourselves in this revolutionary torrent; to take root and grow up among the masses of the people, and to learn and improve through labor training; to become true working-class intellectuals is the glorious goal of our hard work! Going to the countryside! Going to the mountains! – Responding to the Party’s call: We have no worries at all, only the passion of soldiers and the pride of revolutionaries! Family difficulties cannot block our path, and comfortable living cannot hold back our feet; we must go to the places where the motherland needs us most, and push all the forests, wildernesses, barren mountains, and deserts of the motherland onto the broad road of socialist prosperity!

　　下乡去！上山去！
    屠岸下乡去！上山去！——响应党的号召：叫只会拿笔杆的手去插秧扶犁握锄操镰刀！叫知识分子的思想感情去晒晒太阳，洗洗澡，把个人主义的毒菌统统晒死，把自私自利的污垢兜底洗掉！下乡去！上山去！——响应党的号召：去再一次参加革命，在这革命的洪流里
  把自己彻底改造；在人民群众中生根长大，在劳动锻炼中学习提高；成为真正的工人阶级知识分子是我们努力奋斗的光荣目标！下乡去！上山去！——响应党的号召：我们没有丝毫牵挂，有的只是战士的激情，革命者的自豪！家庭的困难，挡不了我们路，安逸的生活拉不住我们的脚；我们要到祖国最需要我们的地方去，把祖国的一切森林原野荒山大漠全都推上社会主义繁荣的康庄大道！
