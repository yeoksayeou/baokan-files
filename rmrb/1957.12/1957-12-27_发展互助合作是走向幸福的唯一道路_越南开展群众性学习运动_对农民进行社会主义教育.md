Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 26th: A large-scale movement to provide socialist education to farmers is currently underway in North Vietnam. This movement is scheduled to continue until the end of January next year.

In early October of this year, more than 100,000 rural members of the Vietnam Workers' Party participated in political study. The current socialist education movement will be an even larger mass learning movement. The aim of the movement is to enable Vietnamese farmers, who have a rich revolutionary tradition, to recognize that the nature of the revolution in North Vietnam is shifting from an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal national democratic revolution to a socialist revolution; to make farmers understand that they should not take the capitalist road, but should take the socialist road by developing mutual assistance and cooperation.

Two forms of learning are being adopted in this movement: rural non-Party grassroots cadres are organized into study classes in the same way as Party members; and the broad masses of farmers are organized into report meetings, followed by discussions. The reports particularly emphasize the consistency between the interests of farmers and the interests of the state, and that the path of mutual assistance and cooperation is the only way for farmers to achieve happiness.

Farmers who actively participated in the War of Resistance and were emancipated in the land reform are eager to participate in political study. As early as when the rural Party member study classes began to form, farmers in many places voluntarily provided the study classes with desks, chairs, and grain, and requested the Party members to explain to them after they had finished their studies.

The "People's Daily," the organ of the Vietnam Workers' Party, published an editorial on the 25th, pointing out the significance of this study movement for leading farmers to take the socialist road, and demanding that Party committees at all levels attach great importance to this movement.

    发展互助合作是走向幸福的唯一道路
    越南开展群众性学习运动
    对农民进行社会主义教育
    据新华社河内26日电　越南北方目前正在开展一个大规模的对农民进行社会主义教育的运动。这个运动预定要进行到明年1月底。
    今年10月初，越南劳动党十多万农村党员曾经参加了政治学习。目前这次社会主义教育运动将是一次规模更大的群众性学习运动。运动的目的是使富有革命传统的越南农民认识到越南北方的革命性质正在从反帝反封建的民族民主革命转变为社会主义革命；使农民懂得不应当走资本主义道路而应当通过发展互助合作来走社会主义道路。
    在这次运动中采取两种学习方式：对农村非党员基层干部采取同党员一样的学习班的组织形式；对广大农民采取报告会的形式，并在会后组织讨论。在报告会上特别着重讲解农民利益同国家利益的一致性以及互助合作的道路是农民走向幸福的唯一大道。
    积极参加过抗战和在土改中翻了身的农民，对政治学习的要求是迫切的。早在农村党员学习班开始组成时，许多地方的农民就主动地把学习用的桌、椅和粮食供给学习班，并且要求党员们学完以后给他们讲解。
    越南劳动党机关报“人民报”25日发表社论，指出这次学习运动对领导农民走社会主义道路的意义，并且要求各级党委十分重视这次运动。
