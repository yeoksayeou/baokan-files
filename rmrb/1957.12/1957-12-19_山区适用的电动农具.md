    Electric Farm Tools Suitable for Mountainous Areas

    An electric farm tool suitable for use in mountainous areas has recently been successfully tested at the Nanping Chemical Plant in Fujian Province.

    This electric farm tool can perform various tasks such as plowing, harrowing, sowing, rice planting, inter-tillage, and harvesting by simply attaching different tools. Each electric farm tool, operated by only two people, can plow thirty to fifty mu per work day, which is equivalent to ten people using ten oxen to plow. (Sun Yongyuan)

    山区适用的电动农具
    一种适合山区使用的电动农具最近在福建省南平化工厂试验成功。
    这种电动农具只要分别安上不同工具，就可以干各种不同的活，如翻土、耙土、播种、插秧、中耕、收割等。每部电动农具，只要两个人操纵，每个工作日可以翻土三十至五十亩，顶得上十个人架十头牛耕地。　（孙永源）
