    Supplying New Power Machinery to Rural Areas
    Trial Production of Large Coal Gas Engine Successful
    (Xinhua News Agency, Jinan) The state-owned Weifang Diesel Engine Factory has recently successfully trial-produced the 6160-type 120-horsepower coal gas engine. According to the national plan, it will be officially put into production at this factory next year.
    This coal gas engine has a wide range of uses and can be used as power for large machinery such as generators, water pumps, and fishing vessels. Given that China currently has abundant coal reserves and a shortage of liquid fuels, the use of this coal gas engine is of even greater practical significance.

    供应农村新动力机械
    大型煤气机试制成功
    据新华社济南电　国营潍坊柴油机厂最近试制成功六一六○型一二○马力煤气机；根据国家计划，它明年将在这个厂正式投入生产。
    这种煤气机用途很广，可以用作发电机、抽水机、渔轮等大型机械的动力。在目前我国煤藏量多、液体燃料少的情况下，使用这种煤气机更具有现实意义。
