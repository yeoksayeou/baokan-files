Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 22nd: Shanghai has launched a mass winter campaign to eliminate the four pests throughout the city. The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee requires leaders at all levels to take the lead, and everyone to take action to eliminate the four pests, making Shanghai a city without mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows (in suburban areas).

The Secretaries of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Secretariat and the Vice Mayors of Shanghai have participated in the anti-four pest campaign with thousands of cadres, going to pastures, animal hair and bone workshops, agricultural cooperatives, and other places to dig up fly pupae and eliminate overwintering mosquitoes and flies. Cadres also actively cleaned up the dirtiest places everywhere, some crawling into sewers to dig out sludge, some using smoke in the basements of buildings to smoke mosquitoes, and some going to neighborhoods to help residents wash and clean garbage bins.

    人人动手使上海成为“四无”城市
    上海市领导干部带头扑灭蚊蝇
    新华社上海22日电  上海市已经在全市展开一个群众性的冬季除四害运动。上海市人民委员会要求各级领导带头，人人动手，消灭四害，使上海成为一个无蚊、无蝇、无鼠、无雀（郊区）的城市。
    中共上海市委书记处书记和上海市副市长们曾经同成千个干部一起参加了除四害运动，他们到牧场、兽毛骨作、农业合作社等处挖蝇蛹，扑灭过冬蚊蝇。干部们还到处积极打扫最肮脏的地方，有的钻到阴沟里挖污泥，有的在大楼的地下室内用烟雾熏蚊子，有的到里弄帮助居民洗刷和清扫垃圾箱。（附图片）
