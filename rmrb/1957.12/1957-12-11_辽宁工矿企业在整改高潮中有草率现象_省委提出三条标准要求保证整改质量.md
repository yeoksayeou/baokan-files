Liaoning Industrial and Mining Enterprises Show Hasty Phenomena in Rectification Upsurge
Provincial Party Committee Proposes Three Standards to Ensure the Quality of Rectification

(Our Newspaper Dispatch) (Reporter Jin Yukun) The rectification upsurge in industrial and mining enterprises in Liaoning has formed across the entire province. Enterprises that started rectification earlier have already processed 70% to 90% of employee opinions, while those that started later have processed 50% to 70%. In just one month, over a thousand enterprises have resolved more than two million issues. In particular, by resolving significant issues in streamlining institutions, reforming production, and reducing costs, the appearance of many enterprises has undergone major changes.

Enterprises that have carried out rectification work relatively well have not only seriously addressed general issues but also resolutely solved some major problems within the enterprise. For example, after resolving 80% of general issues, the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant focused its energy on three major issues: streamlining institutions, leadership style, and welfare benefits. It mobilized the masses to propose improvement plans in these three areas. Due to the serious handling of general issues, employee enthusiasm was greatly encouraged, and everyone enthusiastically offered opinions on major issues, thus the rectification work progressed rapidly. Currently, the work of streamlining institutions has come to an end, and they have begun to carry out business reforms. These enterprises paid attention to both leadership taking the lead and turning rectification work into a mass action. Many factories have organized special rectification groups with the participation of the factory director and Party committee secretary, and at the same time widely mobilized the masses to find reasons, think of solutions, and make suggestions. Everyone worked together to solve problems. To ensure the quality of rectification, these enterprises generally organized review work. The Shenyang Smelter, led by the factory director, Party committee secretary, and ten others, conducted a review, visiting more than 400 employees in three days to understand their opinions on the rectification work; at the same time, it organized a broad review by representatives of all employees in the factory. This played a significant role in correcting the phenomenon of rough rectification. Many factories have paid attention to using the organizational form of the employee representative assembly when discussing major issues, formulating and passing reform plans, and implementing reforms on major issues. According to incomplete statistics, in Shenyang alone, twelve factories convened employee representative assemblies, some even convened them three or four times.

Currently, the appearance of many enterprises has been completely renewed. At the Anshan Cast Iron Pipe Plant, employees criticized the leadership style for not being thorough during the great blooming and contending, and that no one was on duty in the factory and workshops at night, and problems were not resolved, so the state plan was not completed every month, and the product quality was also very poor. During the rectification, the factory's leadership immediately implemented a system of night duty for factory and workshop leaders and cadres, and went deep into the site to study and discuss with veteran workers and engineers to solve the key quality problems that had not been solved for several years. In October, the factory produced 1,800 tons more steel pipes, and the quality exceeded the state's requirements. The Huanggu Tun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory used to be a factory with very backward cost control in the country. In the past four and a half years, the factory only reduced costs by 9% to 16%, and the repair cost was more than 30% higher than advanced factories. During the rectification, the factory proposed a practical and feasible reform plan to reduce costs, and now the factory has jumped into the ranks of advanced enterprises.

At present, a considerable number of enterprises in Liaoning still have phenomena of hasty and formalistic work in rectification work. Some enterprise leaders, seeing that most of the opinions of the masses have been dealt with, have developed a relaxed mood. Many enterprise leaders are eager to hastily end the rectification and plan to move on to the great debate before the rectification has achieved complete victory. In fact, although these enterprises have solved about 80% of the problems, strictly speaking, most of them have solved some problems on a case-by-case basis, or simply explained, answered, or apologized. Some factories even replaced actual actions with empty responses such as "improve," "overcome," "study," and "accept." The Shenyang Paper Mill gave a printed reply of "research and solve" no matter what opinions the masses raised. One worker received more than 30 "research and solve," but none of the problems he raised were solved, so he was so angry that he posted all 30 "research and solve" on big-character posters. Some factories, seeing the words "house" in the opinions of the masses, gave a printed reply of "the country has difficulties, and there are insufficient houses." Some workers at the Shenyang Smelter raised the opinions that the house was leaking and the toilet needed to be repaired, and the reply was also "there are insufficient houses." Some workers suggested "please do not sweep the floor when someone is eating in the cafeteria," but the reply was: "We will improve the quality of the food in the future." The leaders of some factories are only satisfied with writing empty checks. Employees criticized and said: "Our factory's leaders are more talkers than doers; we only hear what they say, but we don't see what they do." Although solving major problems of enterprises cannot be required too urgently, the leaders of some enterprises have not considered these problems enough. Some people's understanding is still stuck at the stage of how many opinions there are in which area. What are the main problems of this enterprise? Some people cannot say the reason or explain it clearly. In particular, the problems of leadership style, the leaders of many enterprises have not paid enough attention to.

In order to prevent the phenomenon of hasty rectification in enterprises, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has recently put forward three standards, stipulating that all those who do not meet these three standards are not allowed to enter the great debate. The three standards are: 1. The correct and basically correct opinions of the employees during the blooming and contending have been basically resolved within the scope of the factory. 2. The main major problems of the factory have been basically resolved. 3. After several reviews, the masses are basically satisfied with the rectification. If the factory believes that it has reached the above standards, it will enter the debate after being approved by the local Party committee.

　　辽宁工矿企业在整改高潮中有草率现象
    省委提出三条标准要求保证整改质量
    本报讯　记者金雨困报道：辽宁地区工矿企业的整改高潮已经在全省范围内形成。开展整风较早的企业，职工意见已经处理70％到90％，较迟的也已经处理50％到70％。在短短的一个月内，一千多个企业解决了二百万个以上的问题。特别是由于在紧缩机构、生产改革、降低成本等方面解决了一些重大问题，许多企业的面貌发生了重大的改变。
    整改工作进行得比较好的企业，既认真处理了一般性的问题，又狠狠地解决了企业的一些重大问题。如沈阳矿山机器厂在一般问题解决80％以后，就把精力主要集中到紧缩机构、领导作风和生活福利等三大问题上，发动群众从这三个方面提出改进方案。这个厂由于认真处理了一般问题，职工积极性受到很大鼓舞，大家对重大问题都热烈提意见，因此整改工作进展很快。目前紧缩机构工作已经告一段落，开始着手进行业务改革。这些企业在整改中既注意了领导亲自动手，又注意把整改工作变成群众性的行动。许多工厂由厂长、党委书记参加组织了整改专门小组，同时广泛发动群众找原因，想办法，提建议，大家动手解决问题。为了保证整改质量，这些企业一般都组织了复查工作。沈阳冶炼厂由厂长、党委书记等十一人负责进行复查，在三天内访问了四百多名职工，了解他们对整改工作的意见；同时组织全厂职工代表进行了广泛的复查。这对及时纠正整改粗糙的现象起了很大作用。不少工厂在讨论重大问题、制订和通过改革方案、实行对重大问题的改革的时候，都注意运用了职工代表大会这一组织形式。据不完全统计，仅沈阳市就有十二个工厂召开了职工代表大会，有的还先后召开了三、四次。
    现在，许多企业的面貌已经焕然一新。鞍山铸管厂职工在大鸣大放中批评领导作风不深入，厂和车间晚间无人值班，发生问题无人解决，所以月月完不成国家计划，产品质量也很差。在整改中，这个厂的领导立即实行了厂和车间领导干部夜间值班的制度，并且深入现场同老工人、工程师共同研究商量，解决了几年来没有解决的质量关键问题。10月份，这个厂多产钢管一千八百吨，质量超过了国家的要求。皇姑屯机车客车修理工厂原来是全国成本工作很落后的工厂。在过去的四年半中，这个厂只降低成本9％到16％，修理成本比先进工厂高出30％以上。在整改中，这个厂提出了一个切实可行的降低成本的改革方案，现在这个厂已经跃进了先进企业的行列。
    目前，辽宁地区还有相当数量的企业，在整改工作中存在着草率从事和形式主义的现象。有些企业的领导人员看到群众意见已经大部得到处理，便产生了松劲情绪。不少企业的领导人员急于草率结束整改，打算在整改尚未取得全胜以前就转入大辩论。实际上，这些企业虽说已经解决了80％左右的问题，但是严格讲起来，多是就事论事地解决了一些问题，或者仅仅是解释、答复、道歉。有的厂甚至以“改进”、“克服”、“研究”、“接受”等空洞的答复代替了实际行动。沈阳造纸厂无论群众提什么意见，都给一张印好的“研究解决”的答复，一个工人接到三十多张“研究解决”，但是他所提的问题却一个也没有解决，因此他气得把三十多张“研究解决”都贴上了大字报。有的厂看到群众意见中有“房子”两字的，就给一张印好的“国家有困难，房子不足”的答复。沈阳冶炼厂有的工人提了房屋漏雨、厕所要修理的意见，答复也是“房子不足”。有的工人提出“食堂有人吃饭时，请不要扫地”，答复却是：“今后要提高饭菜质量”。有的厂的领导人员只满足于开空头支票，职工批评说：“咱们厂的领导是嘴将多，干将少；只听其言，不见其行。”解决企业的重大问题虽然不能要求过急，但是目前有些企业的领导人员对这些问题确实考虑得很不够。有的人的认识还仍然停留在哪个方面有多少条意见的阶段，究竟这个企业存在的主要问题是什么？有些人就说不出道理，讲不清楚。特别是领导作风方面的问题，不少企业的领导人员还注意得不够。
    中共辽宁省委为了防止企业整改草率从事的现象，最近提出了三条标准，规定凡是达不到这三条标准的一概不准转入大辩论。这三条标准是：一、职工鸣放中正确和基本正确的意见，凡是本厂范围内能够解决的已经基本解决。二、本厂的主要重大问题已经得到基本解决。三、经过几次复查以后，群众对整改基本上满意。厂内认为已经达到上述标准的，经过当地党委批准，然后转入辩论。
