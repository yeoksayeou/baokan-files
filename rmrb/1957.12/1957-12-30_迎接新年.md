    Welcoming the New Year
    Shandong
    Shandong Province will have a greater increase in the supply of most non-staple foods and industrial products during the New Year period than in the same period last year. Among non-staple foods such as pork, beef, mutton, eggs, chicken, cigarettes, alcohol, vegetables, aquatic products, and fruits, most commodities can be supplied sufficiently. Fresh eggs will increase by 145% compared to the same period last year, live chickens by 393%, and live pigs by 45%. Among cosmetics, entertainment items, and industrial products, most varieties can also meet the supply, except for a few.
    For certain commodities in short supply, it has been decided to compress the usual daily supply to ensure the needs of the masses during the holidays. Service departments are also required to satisfy the various needs of travelers and local people in the catering, hairdressing, and bathhouse industries as much as possible.
    Liaoning
    The people of Liaoning Province will receive an ample supply of New Year's goods when celebrating the New Year of 1958. The Provincial Service Department plans to supply more than 90,050 pigs and 1,300 cattle and sheep to the province before and after the New Year. In December, urban residents can purchase one jin of pork per person with a certificate, in addition to the rationed quantity. Muslims can purchase one jin of beef or mutton. Commercial departments in various places will allocate approximately 700,000 jin of stored eggs to the market. Various fresh and delicate vegetables totaling more than 26 million jin will be put on the market by vegetable and fruit companies. The supply of apples and pears during the New Year will increase nearly twofold compared to usual days. A large quantity of aquatic products is also being transported to the market.
    Harbin
    This year, the average quantity of non-staple foods (main varieties) that each person in Harbin City can buy during the New Year period will increase by about 30% compared to the same period last year. Among these main non-staple foods, the supply of pork will increase by 100% compared to last year, and fish by 70%.
    In addition, arrangements have been made for the sales work of commercial outlets throughout the city. The Municipal People's Committee held a meeting of district heads and relevant commercial departments to balance the supply of non-staple foods for the New Year and decided to start supplying pork, beef, white wine, and apples from December 24th; the remaining varieties will be supplied from December 29th.
    Qinghai
    In order to ensure the holiday supply work, the Provincial Service Department made arrangements to its affiliated companies as early as the beginning of September.
    Commercial departments have learned from past experiences, especially the experience and lessons of last year's holiday material supply, and the supply of non-staple foods for the 1958 New Year's Day and Spring Festival will be greatly improved. In terms of meat supply, in addition to the current inventory of 4,500 live pigs, the Provincial Food Company will also purchase 9,900 live pigs from agricultural areas and counties before the Spring Festival. The supply of beef and mutton is abundant, and all regions can meet the supply. Vegetables will increase by about 30% compared to the same period last year.

    迎接新年
    山东
    山东省在新年期间大多数副食品和工业品的供应量，将比去年新年期间有较大的增长，猪、牛、羊肉、蛋、鸡、烟、酒、蔬菜、水产和果品等副食品中，多数商品可以充分供应。鲜蛋将比去年同期增长145％，毛鸡增长393％，生猪增长45％。化装用品、娱乐用品、工业品中，除个别品种外，大多数品种也能满足供应。
    对某些不足商品，确定压缩平日供应，保证群众节日的需要。服务部门还要求饮食业、理发、澡塘业尽量满足旅客和当地群众多方面的需要。
    辽宁
    辽宁全省人民在欢度1958年新年的时候，将得到充足的年货供应。省服务厅计划在新年前后，供应全省猪九万五十多头，牛羊一千三百头。城市居民在12月份，除定量供应的数量以外，每个人可以凭证购买猪肉一斤，回民供应牛羊肉一斤。各地商业部门从贮存的鸡蛋中拨出大约七十万斤供应给市场。蔬菜水果公司投放到市场的各种鲜菜和细菜将有二千六百多万斤。新年期间苹果和梨的供应量将比平日增加近两倍。大批水产品也正源源运到市场。
    哈尔滨
    哈尔滨今年全市人民在新年期间，每人平均买到的副食品的数量（主要品种），将比去年同一时期增加30％左右，其中有些主要副食品，如猪肉的供应量比去年增加了一倍；鱼增加70％。
    此外，对全市各商业网点的售货工作也进行了布置。市人民委员会召开了各区长和有关商业部门的会议，对新年副食品供应进行了平衡，并决定：从12月24日起开始供应猪、牛肉、白酒、苹果；其余品种从12月29日开始供应。
    青海
    为了保证节日供应工作，省服务厅早在9月初即向所属各公司作了布置。
    商业部门由于接受了以往，特别是去年节日物资供应的经验教训，1958年元旦、春节副食品供应将有很大的改进。在肉食供应上，省食品公司除目前库存生猪四千五百头外，在春节前还要从农业区各县收购生猪九千九百头。牛、羊肉货源充沛，各地均可满足供应。蔬菜较去年同期增加30％左右。
