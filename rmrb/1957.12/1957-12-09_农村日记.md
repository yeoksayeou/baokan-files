　　Rural Diary
　　By Li Fuji, Member of Red Flag Agricultural Cooperative

　　The following three diary entries were published in the Shaanxi Daily. The author, Li Fuji, was originally a cadre at the Construction Bank of Xi'an and is a graduate of Beijing Agricultural University. In the first batch of cadres sent to the countryside from Xi'an, he resolutely applied to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, and he is now a member of the Red Flag Agricultural Cooperative. The "Yu" mentioned in the diary is his wife, Chen Yuanyu, who is currently studying at Xi'an Normal School.

            November 8th
　　Today is the second day that we have participated in production at the agricultural cooperative. After breakfast, the veteran cooperative members took us to hoe garlic sprouts. This is a new job for us. When we got to the field, the veteran cooperative members first told us: "Hold the small hoe tightly to avoid getting blisters on your hands. When hoeing, don't hoe too deep, and carefully remove every weed. If you can't remove them with the hoe, pull them out by hand." After explaining, they skillfully demonstrated for a while for us to watch.

　　This job sounds and looks easy, but our hands don't listen to commands. We hoe sometimes deep, sometimes shallow, the soil clumps are large and not fine enough, and often the weeds aren't removed, but the garlic sprouts are hoed off first. The veteran cooperative members patiently taught and corrected us. Especially our female comrades-in-arms, after working for only a short time, each had several "big cannons" (blisters) on their hands, and their legs were sore from squatting. But they did not bow their heads to the difficulties. When they could no longer squat, they took small stools from home during breaks and sat on them to hoe. When their hands blistered, they bandaged them with towels and continued to hoe. At this time, I realized for the first time the arduousness and meticulousness of physical labor, the glory of labor, and recognized that intellectuals can only transform themselves into true working people's intellectuals through actual physical labor.
            November 11th
　　Yesterday, due to the rain, we couldn't go to the fields. Having nothing to do, I changed some clothes and washed them, but I unexpectedly caught a cold and developed a fever. Although "Auntie" and "Uncle" kindly made me some spicy and sour soup and told me to sweat it out, I still felt uncomfortable.

　　After getting up in the morning, I heard the veteran cooperative members say that today's job was to go to the fields to harvest wild rice stems. I suddenly forgot about my illness and wanted to go with them. The veteran cooperative members saw that I was not feeling well and would not let me go, telling me to rest for another day, but I couldn't sit idle!

　　When I got to the field, I prepared to take off my shoes and go into the water, but the veteran cooperative members and the team leader resolutely disagreed. They said, "The water in the field is not only very cold, but the mud is also very deep, and it's old mud that doesn't see the sun all year round, it's very cold, your body can't take it!" Some also said, "The wild rice stem leaves are as sharp as knives, and if you're not careful, you'll cut your legs. You're new here and don't have any experience, so it's better not to go down!" How concerned and caring they are for me, treating me like their own child! This further inspires me to respect them and learn from their enthusiasm for labor. Although I promised not to go into the water, I later secretly went into the water. Unexpectedly, many veteran cooperative members spread this story like a good tale after returning home!
            November 16th
　　Today is the second Saturday after I came to the countryside. Yu wrote in a letter that she would come to see me in the afternoon and check on my labor situation.

　　Whenever I think of Yu, my face gets a little hot. When I initially responded to the Party's call to come to the countryside, I was afraid that she would disagree, afraid that she would stop loving me, and I didn't want to tell her. Unexpectedly, after she found out, she strongly supported and encouraged me to do so, and personally took me to the agricultural cooperative. When she left, she earnestly said: "Although you have some theoretical knowledge, you don't have any practical experience. I hope you will settle down, train yourself in actual labor, improve your class consciousness, and transform yourself into a new type of farmer who has both cultural knowledge and practical experience." She repeatedly stated: "I hope you will be victorious on the labor front! Strictly demand yourself to move forward with the conditions of a Communist Youth League member!" Her words are a never-ending force for me. When I'm sore and tired from labor, when I lie in bed in the early morning afraid to get up, when I think of her fiery words full of hope, I immediately have strength. When I become covered in dust and dirt during labor, and some old women jokingly say, "Your lover will definitely not love you when she sees you," I feel particularly happy. I say to myself: You don't understand Yu. Our love is based on a political foundation. She will always love me. If she saw me like this, she might be happy!

　　When Yu came in the afternoon, she asked me how my labor was going as soon as she saw me? Am I getting used to the life? I told her to go to the production team to ask. When she heard that I was working diligently and willing to work hard, she happily encouraged me to continue to work hard, overcome difficulties, and humbly learn from the veteran cooperative members. She repeatedly asked me what agricultural magazines I needed and said that she would subscribe for me when she returned to school. She also happily said, "In the past, when we were in the city, on Saturday nights and Sundays, we either watched movies, played cards, played chess, or wandered the streets, wasting so much precious time. Now you are busy with production every day, and you won't waste time anymore!"

　　农村日记
　　红旗农业社社员　李福继
    这三则日记，是陕西日报发表的。作者李福继，原是西安市建设银行的干部，是北京农业大学毕业的。西安市第一批下放干部时，他即坚决申请到农村去参加农业生产，现在他已是红旗农业社的社员了。日记里面所提的“钰”，是他的爱人陈元钰，现在西安师范学校读书。
                                                ·编　者·

    今天是我们到农业社参加生产的第二天了。吃罢早饭，老社员带我们去锄蒜苗。这对我们来说还是个新的工作，到地里后，老社员首先告诉我们：“锄草先要把小锄头握紧，这样可免手上打泡；在锄草时不要锄得太深，要细致地除掉每一棵杂草，除不了的地方就用手拔。”讲完后又熟练地作了一阵让我们看。
    这个活听起来和看起来倒也容易，可是我们的手总是不听指挥，不但锄的深一下，浅一下，土块又大，很不细致，还往往杂草没有除掉，蒜苗却先被锄断了。累得老社员又来耐心地教和纠正。特别是我们的女战友们，工作还没有多久，每个人的手上就捷获了几门“大炮”
  （泡），两腿也蹲痛了。但是她们并没有向困难低头，腿不能蹲了，她们便趁休息时间从家里拿来小凳坐着锄；手上打了泡，就用手巾绑着继续锄。这时我才第一次体会到体力劳动的艰巨和细致，体会到劳动的光荣并且认识到知识分子只有通过实际的体力劳动才能把自己变为一个真正的劳动人民的知识分子。
            11月11日
    昨日由于天雨不能下地，闲着无事，我便换了几件衣服去洗，没想到因此却着了凉，身体发烧。虽然“大妈”和“大伯”关心地给我弄了些辣子酸汤叫我发了些汗，但是身体还是不舒服。
    早晨起床后，听老社员们说，今天的活是下地割茭白，我忽然忘记了有病，也要跟着去。老社员见我身体不好，不让我去，要我再休息一天，可是我怎么也不能闲蹲着！
    到地里后，我便准备脱鞋下水，老社员和组长坚决不同意，他们说：“地里的水不但很冷，泥也很深，而且是整年不见太阳的陈泥，冷得很，你身体经受不了！”有的还说：“茭白叶子像刀子一样锋利，一不小心就会把腿划破，你才来没有经验，还是不要下去！”他们对我是多么的关心和照顾，把我当作自己的子弟一样地看待！这更激发了我尊重他们，学习他们热爱劳动的热情。虽然我答应不下水，然而后来我还是偷偷地下了水。不料许多老社员回家后把这件事当作佳话一样地传开了！
            11月16日
    今天是我下农村后的第二个星期六，钰来信说，下午她要来看我，并且检查我的劳动情况。
    一提起钰，我的脸就有些发烧，当初我响应党的号召，要到农村来时，还怕她不同意，怕她因此不爱我了，不想告诉她。不料她知道后，却极力赞成和鼓励我这样做，并且亲自把我送到农业社来。临走时还恳切地说：“你虽有些理论知识，但是没有实际经验，希望你安下心来，在实际劳动中锻炼自己，提高自己的阶级觉悟，将你变成一个既有文化知识，又有实际经验的新式农民。”并再三表示：“希望你在劳动战线上胜利！以共青团员的条件严格要求自己前进！”她的话，对我是一股永远不息的力量，当我劳动得腰酸腿疼，清早睡在床上怕起来的时候，一想起她像火焰般满怀希望的话，立即就有了力量；当我在劳动中变得全身尘土，满面污垢，有的老大娘开玩笑地说：“你的爱人看见一定不爱你”时，我却特别觉得高兴，心里说：你们那里了解钰，我们的爱情是建立在政治基础上的，她永远是爱我的，如果她看到我这个样子，也许会高兴呢！
    下午钰来后，一见面就问我劳动得怎么样？生活习惯吗？我叫她到生产队上去问，当她听说我劳动踏实，肯干时，高兴地鼓励我继续努力，克服困难，虚心地向老社员学习，并一再问我需要农业方面的什么杂志，她回学校后代我订阅。并且还高兴地说：“过去在城里时，星期六晚和星期日，咱们不是看电影、打朴克、下棋，就是逛街道，浪费了多少宝贵的时间，现在你每天忙于生产，不再会浪费时间了！”
