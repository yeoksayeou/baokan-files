An Examination of the Murderer
　　Zhuang Nong

Xu Maoyong said that he was a “warrior” who was not afraid of sacrifice, a "sweeper" of "social darkness," a representative of "truth," and an embodiment of "justice." In short, he was extremely "great." However, the facts have proved that he was nothing more than a murderer who committed many evils. His so-called "risking one's life" was originally intended to "pull the Communist Party off its horse."

There are plenty of proofs of his crimes. He himself listed eight major "crimes," which can be regarded as irrefutable. One item is called "viciously attacking senior cadres and leading cadres." The examples of this single item are countless. More than half of the nearly one hundred essays in more than half a year were engaged in this kind of activity. As for "Cicada Chatter Jottings," "Weapons, Instruments of Torture, and Props," "The Big Scene Wall," "The Headwind of the Hundred Schools of Thought," and the set of essays on so-called "democracy" published in the People's Daily, they are only the more prominent of the proofs, and are by no means all of them.

Xu Maoyong's methods of attacking "senior cadres" were varied: scolding, slander, sarcasm, vilification, backstabbing, and venomous accusations were all used to the extreme. As a result, in Xu Maoyong's writing, those "eighth-grade senior cadres," "ninth-grade senior cadres," "provincial party secretaries," "ministerial-level leaders," "a senior leader," and "an even more senior leader," etc., were not even one decent one among them. They were either scolded as "slaves" who "obeyed their masters and subdued their masters"; or ridiculed as quack doctors who were unlearned and only relied on "secret books" to peddle "panaceas" to people; or vilified as "昏庸" (昏庸 - muddle-headed and incompetent), "多忌" (多忌 - excessively cautious and suspicious), "怯懦" (怯懦 - timid), "心胸狭隘" (心胸狭隘 - narrow-minded), "色厉内荏" (色厉内荏 - fierce in appearance but faint-hearted) pus-filled rulers, who would "collapse at the slightest squeeze." Since these "senior cadres" were so inadequate, there was nothing to be afraid of. But Xu Maoyong insisted that they were very scary: like "cats catching mice" and "mantises catching cicadas." In short, they were utterly bad. Throughout history and in the world, there has never been anything so dirty, chaotic, or dark. If "sweepers" like Xu Maoyong and his ilk did not come out to thoroughly "sweep" them away, there would be no other way to think of it, and the world would never see the light of day. What a vicious slander!

However, the people are no longer patient to listen to Xu Maoyong and his ilk babbling endlessly. In their eyes, right and wrong, merits and demerits, good and evil, beauty and ugliness, and truth and falsehood are all clear. They cannot be deceived by the flowery words of Xu Maoyong and his ilk. Finally, they could not bear it any longer and personally took action to "sweep" them away. With a wave of their hands, the social scum, garbage, and maggots of Xu Maoyong and his ilk were all swept up (in fact, it was only a small handful) and piled in the corner of the wall. In this way, their true colors were revealed. Those so-called "warriors" who stirred up trouble and committed evil were actually nothing more than contemptible and ridiculous clowns.

However, he wants to defend himself. He said that one should not only regard the murderer as a murderer, but also ask "experts in human studies" to investigate the process that led them to commit the crime. Because, according to him, maybe "it will be discovered that this person once suffered excessively severe punishment for a minor crime, which made him hate the social system, which caused his resistance..." (March 15th, People's Daily, page eight, Hui Chun: "Simple and Complex")

This is the murderer's unprompted confession and the murderer's sophistry.

Therefore, let us examine the murderer's criminal process.

Precisely when Xu Maoyong was "doing the work of an eighth-rank civil official and holding power in a small area," he used this "power" to wantonly undermine the Party's policy on intellectuals. Therefore, the Party inspected, criticized, and educated this "civil official" who was a Communist Party member, and gave him the punishment of administrative demotion and a Party warning. Then, he was transferred to another smaller area, still "doing the work of a civil official" and still "holding power," which can be said to be treating him well. However, he was "bitterly resentful" and determined to "take revenge." This time, he used "power" to organize a small clique and openly engaged in anti-Party activities. Therefore, the Party educated him again and gave him the punishment of probation within the Party, but still kept him in the Party to save him, and sent him to the Academy of Sciences to do research work, which cannot be said to be not the utmost in benevolence and righteousness. But he used his "often free" time to concentrate on a large number of anti-Party activities, shooting nearly a hundred articles, more than 200,000 words of poisonous arrows at the Party in half a year. And he also declared: he would "burn his boats" either you "step down" or I "perish." In short, it was a matter of "irreconcilable hatred" and "standing apart."

In fact, the so-called "revenge for punishment" is nothing more than a guise to cover up his true face. We can examine the murderer's deeper roots.

According to Xu Maoyong, he "hopes that the Party's life and the country's life" can be "reformed" according to his ideas. For example, reform it into this way: respect traitors, sympathize with murderers, regard exploitation as kindness and virtue, be "humble" to those who seize power, Marxism should be abolished, even if it is not abolished, it should at least have its "class nature removed," the dictatorship of the proletariat should be abolished, the current leaders should all step down, and all people should be treated equally regardless of class.

It is said that he originally wanted to peacefully reform the Party, but he also knew that without "struggle," the Communist Party and socialism would "not willingly disappear." Therefore, he vigorously launched: "Don't be afraid of undemocratic practices," "Don't wait for them to automatically let go," use the "spirit of sacrificing oneself to achieve benevolence to struggle," and concentrate on attacking "senior cadres" (because they are all the backbone of the Communist Party), they are "squashed when squeezed," and there is nothing to be afraid of. He shouted "follow me" to those who were still afraid of openly opposing the Party, and acted as the vanguard of anti-Party activities.

However, his grand schemes became empty words, and the murderer was captured. And he finally began to tell some truths. The general idea is that in order to achieve the goal of attacking senior cadres, the materials were not factual. Some were fantasies, far-fetched, distorted, exaggerated, and irrelevant. He wrote and wrote again in several articles without being ashamed of repetition. The means were extremely despicable (extracted from Xu Maoyong's self-criticism materials).

Our examination, plus this self-confession, proves that: Xu Maoyong "is a murderer," "nothing more and nothing less."

    对凶手的考察
　　庄农
    徐懋庸说自己是不怕牺牲的“勇士”，“社会阴暗”的“扫除者”，“真理”的代表，“正义”的化身，总之，是“伟大”极了。然而事实却证明，他只不过是一个作恶多端的凶手，所谓“拚得一身剐”者，原是想把共产党“拉下马”来的。
    要罪证多得很。他自己列出的就有八大“罪状”，算得上铁案如山了。有一项叫作“恶毒攻击高级干部、领导干部”。只是这一项的事例，也便数不清。半年多中的近百篇杂文，一半以上，都干的是这勾当。至于，“蝉噪居漫笔”、“武器、刑具和道具”、“大场面的墙”、
  “百家争鸣的逆风”以及在人民日报上发表的有关所谓“民主”的那一套杂文，只不过是罪证中较显著的，绝不是全部。
    徐懋庸攻击“高级干部”的手段有多种多样：漫骂有之，诬蔑有之，挖苦、丑化、暗箭中伤、含血喷人不一而足，而且种种又无所不用其极。结果，在徐懋庸的笔下，那些“八级高干”、“九级高干”、“省委书记”、“部长级领导”、“一个高级领导”和“一个更高级的领导”等等，竟是连一个像样的都没有。他们或者被辱骂为“顺从主子而又制服主子”的“奴才”；或者被挖苦为不学无术只是靠了“秘本”向人兜售“灵丹妙药”的江湖骗子；或者被丑化为“昏庸”“多忌”“怯懦”“心胸狭隘”“色厉内荏”的脓包样的统治者，是“一挤就垮”的。既然这些“高干”如此不济，原是没有什么可怕的了。但徐懋庸却偏偏又说他们可怕的很：是“捕鼠的猫”、“捕蝉的螳螂”。总之是坏透了，古往今来，世界上从来也没有这样肮脏过、混乱过、黑暗过。倘不由徐懋庸之流的“扫除者”们出来彻底“扫除”一番，是毫无别的办法可想，世界将要永无天日的了。这是多么恶毒的诬蔑！
    然而，人民却不耐烦再听徐懋庸之流喋喋不休，在他们眼里，是非、功过、善恶、丑美、真伪样样都是分明的，并非徐懋庸之流的花言巧语所能迷惑，终于忍无可忍，亲自动手来“扫除”他们了。挥手之间，把徐懋庸之流的社会渣滓、垃圾、蛆虫们，便都扫集起来（其实，也不过只是一小撮），堆在墙角下。这一来，现了原形，那些兴妖作怪、为非作歹的所谓“勇士”者流，其实不过是可鄙而又可笑的丑角罢了。
    然而，他却又要为自己辩解。说是不能把凶手只看作是凶手，还要由“研究人的专家”，去考察一下促使他们犯罪的经过才行。因为据他说也许“会发现这个人曾经因为犯了轻微的罪过而受到过分严厉的惩罚，这使得他仇恨社会制度，这引起他的反抗……”。（3月15日人民日报八版回春：“简单与复杂”）
    这是凶手的不打自招、又是凶手的狡辩。
    于是，我们来考察这个凶手的犯罪经过。
    正是徐懋庸“做八品文官，在一个小的范围里当权”的时候，他利用这“权”任性地破坏党的关于知识分子的政策。党于是对这个身为共产党员的“文官”检查、批评、教育了一番，并且给了行政撤职和党内警告的处分。然后，又调他到另一个较小的范围内去，还是“做的文官”，仍然还“当权”，可算是待之不薄了。然而他却“怨毒入骨”，立志“报仇”。这次是利用“权”来组织小集团，公然地干起了反党活动。党于是再来教育他，给以留党察看的处分，但仍留在党内加以挽救，而且送他到科学院去作研究工作，这不能说不算仁至义尽了，但他却利用着“心有常闲”的时间，更集中的大量的作起反党活动来，半年之中向党投射出了近百篇、二十多万字的毒箭。而且还宣称：要“破釜沉舟”、或者是你“下台”，或者是我“消亡”，总之，是“不共戴天”“势不两立”的了。
    其实，所谓对“惩罚的报复”，也不过是一种掩饰本来面目的幌子。我们可以考察出这凶手的更深的根底来。
    据徐懋庸说，他“希望党的生活、国家生活方面”能够按照他的主意“有所改造”。比如说改造成这个样子：对叛徒要尊敬，对凶手要同情，把剥削应看作善良、美德，对夺取政权者要“谦让”，马克思主义应该取消，即使不取消起码也要“剜去阶级性”，无产阶级专政要废除，现在的领导统统要下台，对所有人不分阶级一律平等一视同仁等等。
    据说，他原想对党进行和平改造的，然而他又知道，“不经过斗争”，共产党和社会主义，都是“不肯自行消亡的”。于是便大力发动：“不要怕不民主”，“不能等他们自动放手”，要用“杀身成仁的精神斗争”，而且要集中攻击“高级干部”（因为他们都是共产党的骨干），他们是“一挤就垮”的，并没有什么可怕。他向那些还怯于公然反党的人大喊“随我来”，充当了反党的急先锋。
    然而，雄谋成虚话，凶手就擒了。而且终于开始说了一些实话。大意是说：为了达到攻击高级干部的目的，材料并非事实，有些是幻想、牵强附会、歪曲、夸大，而且是东拉西扯，在几篇文章中写了又写不嫌重复，手段是卑鄙之至的（摘自徐懋庸检讨材料）。
    我们的考察，加上这自我的招供，证明了：徐懋庸“是一个凶手”，“仅仅如此而已”。
