　　Implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos
    The third interim report of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, submitted to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, has been published. The report indicates that the previous government, headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma, and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, in the spirit of national unity and people's solidarity, and with the assistance of the International Commission in Laos, had made great efforts towards the implementation of the Geneva Accords and had achieved significant results. As everyone already knows, thanks to these efforts by both sides in Laos and the International Commission, the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units handed over the administration, troops, civil servants, and armaments of the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly to the King; a coalition government with the participation of personnel from the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units was also established on November 19, thus achieving the peaceful reunification of the country. This is a great joyous event for the Lao people and a major achievement in the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos.
    The implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos was not without a long and tortuous struggle. Specifically, while the ceasefire parties in Laos, the relevant countries participating in the Geneva Conference, and the International Commission in Laos were making great efforts to implement the Geneva Accords, the United States was wantonly interfering with and undermining the Geneva Accords. Therefore, there has always been a struggle between two paths on the issue of the peaceful reunification of Laos and the implementation of the Geneva Accords.
    The final declaration of the Geneva Conference clearly stated that the Conference took note of the statements made by the Royal Lao Government regarding the ability of all citizens to participate in the national common life and regarding non-participation in military alliances and the establishment of foreign military bases. The participating countries of the Conference (with the exception of the United States) also stated that, in their relations with Laos, they guaranteed to respect the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Laos, and would not interfere in the internal affairs of Laos in any way. The U.S. representative, however, issued a separate statement at the Geneva Conference, declaring that "the United States will not use threat or force to disturb" the Geneva Accords. But the history of the three years and four months since then has proven that it was the United States, which was unwilling to sign the final declaration and issued a false statement separately at the time, that has carried out countless interferences and sabotages of the internal affairs of Laos and the Geneva Accords.
    In early September 1954, less than two months after the Geneva Conference, the United States gathered some countries that were not Southeast Asian countries to form the so-called "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" Manila aggressive bloc, and announced that it would designate South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia as areas "applicable" to the "treaty." This was the first shot of the United States directly sabotaging the Geneva Accords after it declared that it would not disturb the Geneva Accords. Since then, the United States' heinous acts of interfering in the internal affairs of Laos and attempting to use Laos as a base for its aggression against the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have increased unabatedly. Dulles rushed to Laos in February 1955 to provoke and expand military conflicts in the two provinces, and instigated Chiang Kai-shek's bandit remnants to roam the area of Phong Saly Province in Laos bordering our country, in an attempt to create incidents in order to realize the Manila aggressive bloc's evil conspiracy to turn Laos into an "applicable area," establish a military base in Laos for the purpose of invading China and Vietnam, and thus enslave the Lao people. When the Royal Lao Government, headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma, was negotiating with the Pathet Lao Fighting Units to achieve the country's peaceful reunification and the Geneva Accords, the United States did not hesitate to threaten to cut off "U.S. aid" and carry out divisive activities in the lower Laos region in an attempt to force the Royal Government to abandon its policy of negotiating with the Pathet Lao Fighting Units. The United States was also secretly carrying out activities to overthrow the Phouma cabinet. However, all these conspiracies suffered a shameful defeat under the Lao people's demand for the country's peaceful reunification and the efforts of both sides in Laos to firmly abide by and implement the Geneva Accords.
    Contrary to the United States' policy of aggression, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union have consistently strictly abided by the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding non-interference in the internal affairs of Laos. The Chinese people have always believed that the problems of Laos should be solved by the Lao people themselves, and that no one should interfere. The current Prime Minister of the coalition government, Prince Souvanna Phouma, and our Premier Zhou Enlai signed a joint statement during his visit to China in August 1956, which clearly pointed out that the Chinese government fully respects and supports the Lao government's implementation of a policy of peace and neutrality. The two Premiers also announced in the joint statement that the two governments agreed to abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and develop good-neighborly relations between the two countries. It is well known that the Chinese government strictly abides by the provisions of the Geneva Accords and the joint statement of the two Premiers. Because of this, the traditional friendship between our two countries has greatly developed in recent years.
    In the effort to strive for the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos, the work of the International Commission in Laos, chaired by India, has also played a good role. The third interim report of the International Commission in Laos shows that the Commission has done a lot of work to implement and carry out the various provisions of the Geneva Accords, and the role it has played in preventing the expansion of military conflicts in the two provinces and promoting direct contact between the two sides is even more significant. After the establishment of the Lao coalition government, the International Commission has reported this important achievement in the implementation of the Geneva Accords to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference. The relevant countries of the Geneva Conference have also expressed varying degrees of satisfaction with this achievement.
    It is worth noting the attitude of the United States. A U.S. State Department spokesman issued a statement the day after the establishment of the Lao Royal Coalition Government, stating that the United States "is seriously concerned about developments in Laos." This so-called "serious concern" of the United States actually means that the United States still intends to continue its consistent conspiracy to obstruct the implementation of the Geneva Accords. Until recently, the United States was still attempting to drag Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam into the bankrupt Manila military bloc, and clamored to launch some kind of "anti-subversion" (should read "subversion") movement in Southeast Asian countries. This shows that the United States is absolutely unwilling to give up its conspiracy of subversion and sabotage. Therefore, while congratulating the establishment of the Lao Royal Coalition Government and the achievements of the International Commission in Laos, people see that in order to safeguard the important provisions of the Geneva Accords that prohibit interference in the internal affairs of Laos and the establishment of foreign military bases in Laos (unless otherwise stipulated in the Geneva Accords), the Lao people, the relevant countries of the Geneva Conference, and the International Commission in Laos should continue to work hard to ensure that the Geneva Accords are thoroughly implemented in Laos.

### 日内瓦协议在老挝的实施

　　日内瓦协议在老挝的实施
    老挝国际监察与监督委员会向日内瓦会议两位主席提出的第三次临时报告已经公布。报告的内容表明，以富马亲王为首的前一届政府和前寮国战斗部队本着国家统一和人民团结的愿望，在老挝国际委员会的协助下，曾经对于日内瓦协议的实施作出了巨大的努力，并且已经获得了重要成效。正如大家所已经知道的，由于老挝的双方和国际委员会的这些努力，前寮国战斗部队方面已经将桑怒和丰沙里两省的政权、部队、公务人员和武器弹药移交给国王；有前寮国战斗部队人员参加的联合政府也已经在11月19日成立，因而实现了国家的和平统一。这是老挝人民的大喜事，也是在老挝实施日内瓦协议的一项重大成就。
    日内瓦协议在老挝的实施并不是没有经过长期而曲折的斗争的。具体地说，一方面是老挝的停战双方、参加日内瓦会议的有关国家和老挝国际委员会为实施日内瓦协议而作出巨大努力，另一方面是美国对于日内瓦协议的肆意干涉和破坏。因此，在老挝的和平统一和执行日内瓦协议问题上从来就存在着两条道路的斗争。
    日内瓦会议的最后宣言曾经明白表示，会议注意到老挝王国政府关于使全体公民均能参加全国共同生活和关于不参加军事同盟、不为外国军事力量建立基地的两项声明。会议的参预国（美国除外）还表示，在它们同老挝的关系上，保证尊重老挝的主权、独立、统一和领土完整，并对老挝内政不予任何干涉。美国代表却在日内瓦会议上单独发表了声明，宣布“美国将不使用威胁或武力去妨害”日内瓦协议。但是自从那时以来的三年又四个多月的历史证明，对老挝内政和日内瓦协议进行无数次干涉和破坏的，正是当时不愿在最后宣言上签字而单独发表虚伪的声明的美国。
    1954年9月初，离日内瓦会议不到两个月，美国即纠合了一些并非东南亚的国家组成了所谓“东南亚条约组织”的马尼拉侵略集团，并且宣布将南越、老挝和柬埔寨划为“条约”所“适用”的地区。这是美国在它声明不妨害日内瓦协议以后直接破坏日内瓦协议的第一炮。自此以后，美国对老挝内政进行干涉和企图利用老挝作为它侵略中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国的基地的罪恶行为即有增无已。杜勒斯在1955年2月匆匆赶到老挝去挑起和扩大两省军事冲突，并且唆使蒋帮残匪流窜老挝丰沙里省同我国交界的地区，企图制造事件，以便实现马尼拉侵略集团将老挝变成“适用地区”、在老挝建立以侵略中、越两国为目的的军事基地、并从而奴役老挝人民的罪恶阴谋。在以富马亲王为首的老挝王国政府同寮国战斗部队进行谈判以实现国家的和平统一和日内瓦协议时，美国竟不惜以中断“美援”和在下寮地区进行分裂活动相威胁，企图使王国政府放弃同寮国战斗部队谈判的政策。美国还在暗中进行推翻富马内阁的活动。但是，所有这些阴谋活动，在老挝人民要求国家的和平统一和老挝双方坚定地遵守和执行日内瓦协议的努力下，遭到了可耻的失败。
    同美国的侵略政策相反，越南民主共和国、中国和苏联一贯严格遵守日内瓦协议关于不得干涉老挝内政的条款。中国人民一向认为老挝的问题应该由老挝人民自己解决，任何人不得加以干涉。现在的联合政府首相富马亲王在1956年8月访华时同我国周恩来总理签订的联合声明曾经明确指出：中国政府对于老挝政府执行和平中立政策表示充分的尊重和支持。两国总理在联合声明中还宣布两国政府同意遵守和平共处五项原则，发展两国之间的睦邻关系。中国政府严格信守日内瓦协议和两国总理联合声明的规定是人所共知的。正因为这样，我们两国之间的传统友谊近年来有了很大的发展。
    在争取日内瓦协议在老挝获得实施的努力中，以印度为主席的老挝国际委员会的工作也起了良好的作用。老挝国际委员会的第三次临时报告表明，委员会对于执行和贯彻日内瓦协议各项条款做了许多工作，其中对于防止在两省扩大军事冲突和促使双方进行直接接触方面所起的作用更为显著。老挝联合政府成立以后，国际委员会已将这一实施日内瓦协议的重要成果报告了日内瓦会议两位主席。日内瓦会议有关各国对这一成就也表示了程度不同的满意。
    值得注意的是美国的态度。美国国务院发言人在老挝王国联合政府成立后的第二天发表了一个声明，表示美国“对老挝的发展感到严重的忧虑”。美国的这种所谓“严重的忧虑”实际上就是说美国仍然要继续它的一贯的阻挠日内瓦协议实施的阴谋。直到最近，美国还在企图将老挝、柬埔寨和南越拉进破了产的马尼拉军事集团中去，并且叫嚣要在东南亚各国发动一个什么“反颠复”（应读作颠复”）运动。这说明美国是决不甘愿放弃颠复破坏阴谋的。因此在祝贺老挝王国联合政府成立和老挝国际委员会工作取得成就的同时，人们看到，为了维护日内瓦协议不干涉老挝内政和不得在老挝建立外国军事基地（日内瓦协议另作规定者除外）等重要条款，老挝人民、日内瓦会议有关国家和老挝国际委员会还应继续努力，使得日内瓦协议在老挝获得彻底的实施。
