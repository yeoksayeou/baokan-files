Learning Advanced Basketball Techniques from the Soviet Union
Beijing Men's Basketball Team Coach Chen Wenbin

The three friendly matches in Beijing between the Soviet Russian Republic men's and women's basketball teams fully demonstrated the unique style and excellent techniques of Soviet basketball. They possess strong physiques, good physical training, high speed, good jumping ability, and strong endurance, making them a team with excellent physical and technical training. In the three matches, they displayed a positive, courageous, and tenacious spirit and a strong attacking mentality.

In the three matches in Beijing, the Russian men's and women's basketball teams were not only aggressive in attack but also focused on defense, especially in tight control under the basket, with excellent interception and tackling movements. The Russian team had a significant advantage in rebounding. In the match against the "August 1st" Red Team, they grabbed thirty-two more rebounds than their opponents.

In terms of tactics, the Russian team's use of two centers was outstanding. The two centers under the basket posed a great threat, and they could coordinate with long-range shots from the perimeter, often making it difficult for the opponent to expand or shrink their defensive area. The two centers accounted for 50% of the team's total score. In particular, center Zubkov, who is 2.04 meters tall, possesses excellent technique, being good at both offense and defense. In the match against the Beijing team, despite being heavily guarded, he still scored twenty-three points. Zubkov can not only score under the basket but also shoot from mid-range. Especially noteworthy is his ability to jump and tip the ball into the basket when his teammates' shots miss. Defensively, he can control rebounds and block opponent's shots multiple times. In addition, he can frequently pass and support in offense, screening and cooperating for his teammates. From Zubkov's technique, we can see the development of modern center techniques, no longer confined to fixed areas or performing one or two shooting actions, but requiring centers to have good physical training, jump high, run fast, possess comprehensive skills, and gradually develop towards space.

The technical characteristics of the Russian basketball team are simplicity, speed, and rationality. Passing movements are diverse, the ball is constantly moving, and passes are only for tactical purposes, without any flashy or superfluous movements.

The Russian team's coordination is carried out at high speed. Players without the ball move quickly, always striving to stand in the most advantageous position for attack and to snatch the opponent's ball. These are all advantages that are worth learning from us.

From these three matches, we can also see the characteristics and style of our basketball players. Our players are fast, have strong individual breakthrough abilities, are agile, and have skilled techniques. In particular, the fast-break tactic is used very successfully, and the jump shot with one hand in the air is accurate. In defense, they move quickly, coordinate well, and are quick and effective in tackling and intercepting.

However, our basketball team also exposed many shortcomings in the matches. Tactics are monotonous, lacking cooperation, and tactical changes are sometimes not timely enough. Sometimes, the phenomenon of tactical disorganization occurs. This aspect was more prominent in the "August 1st" Yellow Team. Sometimes, even in advantageous situations, they failed to consolidate and expand their gains, instead showing impatience. The Beijing men's team once led 21-11, and the "August 1st" Red Team also led 14-3, but the visiting team quickly turned the game around in a very short period. A lack of experience was more evident in close scores and the final moments of the game, such as a lack of active and rapid movements and attacks when playing a controlled game. In addition, the matches also revealed insufficient physical training. In intense and fast-paced matches, some players, although technically good, failed to fully utilize their skills due to physical exhaustion.

From these few matches, we can see the importance of further learning advanced basketball techniques from the Soviet Union and improving the ideological level and tactical literacy of coaches and athletes in the future.

We should continue to work hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union's basketball movement is a product of the superior socialist system. It has a clear ideology and purpose and a deep mass foundation. It has a high level of world-class technology. Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, the Soviet basketball movement has absorbed the achievements of Soviet science and synthesized and concentrated the experience of various sports, forming a Soviet basketball system with a unique style. While learning from the Soviet Union, we must also give full play to our own unique style and advantages, actively improve the political and ideological level and tactical literacy of instructors and athletes, especially to improve the physical training and comprehensive technical training of center athletes, vigorously cultivate new forces, and raise our basketball technology to a higher level.

### 学习苏联先进的篮球技术

    学习苏联先进的篮球技术
    北京男子篮球队指导　陈文彬
    苏联俄罗斯共和国男、女篮球队在北京的三场友谊比赛中，充分地体现了苏联篮球运动的特有风格和优良技术。他们具有健壮的体格，良好的身体训练，速度快，弹跳力好，耐久力强，是一支具有良好的身体训练和技术训练的队伍。在三场比赛中，他们表现了积极、勇敢、顽强的作风和旺盛的攻击精神。
    在北京的三场比赛中，俄罗斯男、女篮球队不仅进攻积极，也很重视防守，特别是在篮下控制严密，断球、抢球的动作都很好。在篮板球的争夺中，俄罗斯队占有极大的优势。在对“八一”红队比赛时，他们比对方多抢得了三十二次的篮板球。
    在战术方面，俄罗斯队的双中锋运用得很出色，篮下两个中锋威胁大，外围能配合远投，常使对方扩大和收缩防守面积都很困难，两个中锋得分占全队得分的50％，特别是身高二点零四公尺的中锋祖布科夫具有卓越的技术，能攻善守，在同北京队比赛时，虽然在对方重点的看守下，他一个人还得了二十三分。祖布科夫不但能篮下得分，也会中距离投篮，特别是他能在同伴们投球未进跳起将球拍进篮中。在防守时他又能控制篮下球和拍掉对方多次投篮的球。此外，在进攻中他还能经常传球策应，为同伴掩护、配合。从祖布科夫的技术中可以看到现代中锋技术的发展，不再局限于固定区域，作一两种投篮动作，而要求中锋必须具备良好的身体训练，跳的高，跑的快，技术全面，逐渐向空间发展。
    俄罗斯篮球队的技术特点是朴实、快速和合理，传球动作多样，手中不停球，传球只是为了配合战术的运用，没有丝毫华而不实的多余动作。
    俄罗斯队的配合是在快速中进行的，不拿球的队员移动迅速，随时争取站在最有利的位置进行攻击和抢夺对方的球。这些优点都是很值得我们学习的。
    从这三场的比赛中，也可以看到了我国篮球运动员的特点和风格。我们的队员速度快，个人突破能力强，动作轻巧，技术熟练，特别是快攻战术运用得很成功，跳起空中单手投篮的动作准确。在防守中，移动快，协同配合较好，抢球、断球迅速而有效。
    但我国篮球队在比赛中也暴露了不少缺点，战术单调，缺乏配合，战术变化有时不够及时，有时出现了战术组织不起来的现象，这方面“八一”黄队更为突出，有时还出现了在得利的形势下不能巩固和扩大战果，反而表现了急躁的情况。北京男队曾出现了二十一比十一，“八一”红队也曾出现了十四比三的领先局面，但在极短的时间内便被客队扳回；在比分接近、比赛最后的时刻更显出了缺少经验，如打控制球时缺乏积极快速的动作和攻击。此外，在比赛中还暴露了身体训练不够的现象，在激烈而快速的比赛中，有些队员虽然技术很好，但由于体力不支而未能充分发挥技术。
    从这几场比赛中，可以看出今后怎样进一步学习苏联先进的篮球技术，提高指导和运动员的思想水平和战术素养的重要意义。
    我们应该继续努力学习苏联先进经验，因为苏联的篮球运动是优越的社会主义制度的产物，它有鲜明的思想性和目的性，具有深厚的群众基础。它具有高度的、世界水平的技术。苏联篮球运动在马列主义的思想指导下，吸取了苏联科学的成果，综合和集中了多种体育运动的经验，而形成了具有独特风格的苏联篮球运动体系。在学习苏联的同时，我们还要发挥自己特有的风格和优点，积极提高指导员和运动员的政治思想水平和战术素养，特别是要提高中锋运动员的身体训练和全面技术训练，大力培养新生力量，使我们的篮球技术达到更高的水平。
