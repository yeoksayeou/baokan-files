    Strange Facts
    Three-quarters of the Earth's surface is covered by water. But only 1% of human food comes from the sea and rivers.
    When a person claps vigorously, the heat emitted from the body will be one-sixth, or even one-quarter, more than usual. In a theater with three thousand five hundred people, the heat added by the audience's enthusiastic applause for a wonderful theatrical performance is enough to provide heating for one hundred and twenty houses throughout the winter.
    The temperature change on the moon during a day and night is as follows: during the day, you can swim in completely melted sulfur (+129.5℃); while at night, you can skate on frozen alcohol (-127.5℃).

    地球表面的四分之三都被水遮盖着。但人类的食物只有1％是从海里和河里取得。
    当人用劲鼓掌时，从身体中散发出的热量，将要比平时多六分之一，甚至到四分之一。在一个拥有三千五百人的戏院里，观众为了精彩的戏剧表演而热烈鼓掌时，所增加的热足够供给一百二十间房子在整个冬季的取暖。
    在月亮上一昼夜的温度变化是这样的：在白天，可以在完全溶化了的硫磺里游泳（＋129.5℃）；而在夜里，却又可以穿着冰鞋在冻结了的酒精上滑冰了（－127.5℃）。
