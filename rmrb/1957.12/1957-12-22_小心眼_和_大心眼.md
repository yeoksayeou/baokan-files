    "Narrow-Minded" and "Broad-Minded"
    When British Conservative MP Viscount Hinchingbrooke complained that the United States had been depriving Britain of its independence since the war, weakening Britain's position overseas, and now dragging Britain onto the "death chariot" manufactured by the United States, Macmillan rebuked him for being "narrow-minded." Macmillan said: "We should not forget...we have lived under American...protection for nine years." This is truly "broad-minded."
    Everyone knows that in the past nine years, what Britain has encountered under this "protection" from the United States is precisely what Viscount Hinchingbrooke is dissatisfied with. People still remember that during the Suez Canal crisis last year, the United States stabbed Britain in the back, causing Macmillan to lament at the time, "Not to be a vassal state."
    Now that Macmillan thinks Hinchingbrooke's mind is still too small, then, would turning Britain directly into the 49th state of the United States be considered broad-minded?

    “小心眼”和“大心眼”
    当英国保守党议员欣琴布鲁克子爵抱怨美国在战后一直剥夺英国的独立，削弱英国在海外的地位，并且现在又把英国拉上了美国制造的“死亡之车”时，麦克米伦责备他“小心眼”。麦克米伦说：“我们不该忘记……我们在美国……保护下生活了九年。”这倒真是“大心眼”。
    谁都知道，过去九年里，英国在美国的这种“保护”下碰到的，正是欣琴布鲁克子爵所感到不满的事情。人们还记得，去年苏伊士事件中美国就在英国背后狠狠砍了一刀，使得麦克米伦在当时也发出“不做附庸国”的哀鸣。
    现在麦克米伦既然认为欣琴布鲁克这点心眼还小，那末，是不是要把英国干脆变成美国的第四十九州才算心眼大呢？
