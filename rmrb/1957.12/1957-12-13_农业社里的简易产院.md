　　Simple Maternity Hospital in an Agricultural Cooperative

    (This newspaper reports) The First Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Baijia Township, Deyang County, Sichuan Province, established a simple maternity hospital at the end of June this year.

    The procedures at this maternity hospital are simple. Hospitalization fees for expectant mothers are calculated based on work points. Upon discharge, the bill is settled with work point cards, without cash payment. For example, if a mother stays in the hospital for five days, she only pays the equivalent of three and a half labor days in work points. There is no charge for the antenatal period; mothers only need to bring their own food. If a mother has children with no one to look after them, she can also bring them to the maternity hospital, reducing her worries and allowing her to focus on childbirth. Over the past five months, the hospital building has expanded from two rooms to four, and the number of beds has increased from two to eight. Even now, there are often not enough beds to meet the demand. Before the end of September this year, the maternity hospital had already admitted twenty-nine expectant mothers for childbirth, and both mothers and children were safe and sound.

    The establishment of the maternity hospital has greatly promoted the labor enthusiasm of women. Due to the careful and thoughtful care provided to expectant mothers, they do not need to worry and can focus on childbirth. Cooperative member Xie Xianmo said, "In the past, during the busy farming season, we had to take care of women giving birth and rush to do work in the fields. Now, we send her to the simple maternity hospital, and both mother and child are well, allowing me to work in the fields with peace of mind."

    Now, not only do the women of our own cooperative love the maternity hospital, but also many pregnant women from neighboring townships and cooperatives are requesting to be admitted to this maternity hospital for childbirth. (Du Jialing)

　　农业社里的简易产院
    本报讯　四川省德阳县柏嘉乡第一高级社于今年6月底建立了一所简易产院。
    这个产院的手续简便，产妇的住院费均按工分计收，出院时以工分牌结账，不给现金。如一个产妇住院五天，仅付给三个半劳动日的工分。待产时不收费，只须自带伙食。产妇有小孩无处寄托的也可以带到产院，减少产妇牵挂而安心分娩。五个月来，产院的房子已由两间扩大到四间，床位由两张增加到八张，目前还常有不够应用的现象。今年9月底以前，产院已接纳二十九个产妇住院生产，母子都平安。
    产院成立后，对发挥妇女的劳动积极性起了很大的推动作用。由于对产妇护理细心、周到，使产妇不必担忧而安心生产。社员谢先模说：“过去农忙时要照顾女人生娃娃，又要赶做田里活，现在把她送进简易产院，大人、小孩都很好，使我生产也安心。”
    现在，不但本社妇女热爱产院，就是邻近的一些乡、社的很多孕妇，都要求到这个产院来住院生产。（杜嘉陵）
