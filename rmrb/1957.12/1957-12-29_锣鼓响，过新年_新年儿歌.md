Drums sound, welcoming the New Year,
A firecracker shoots into the sky.
Shoots into the sky, out of sight,
To find the satellite for a greeting.
Greet, shake hands,
Can you take me with you?
Take me for a stroll in the sky,
To see how our motherland is doing?
How is it doing? A good scene,
New factories everywhere.
New factories, machines humming,
Workers working day and night.
Working day and night, adding effort,
New houses, new buildings everywhere.
Everywhere, boundless to see,
Dry fields, terraced fields, rice paddies.
Rice paddies, green and lush,
Next year will surely be a great harvest.
Great harvest, great development,
Imperialists can only stare blankly.
Stare blankly, cannot stop it,
Socialism runs forward.
Running forward, running fast,
To compete with England.
To compete, fifteen years,
We will surely catch up.
Catch up, sing loudly,
The motherland becomes strong and powerful! (With picture)

    锣鼓响，过新年
    ——新年儿歌
    江水
    锣鼓响，过新年，
    一个爆竹飞上天。
    飞上天，看不见，
    去找卫星见见面。
    见见面，拉拉手，
    你能不能带我走？
    带我走，天上逛，
    看看祖国怎么样？
    怎么样？好景象，
    到处都有新工厂。
    新工厂，机器响，
    工人叔叔日夜忙。
    日夜忙，加油干，
    新房新屋一大片。
    一大片，望无边，
    旱田梯田水稻田。
    水稻田，绿油油，
    明年一定大丰收。
    大丰收，大发展，
    帝国主义干瞪眼。
    干瞪眼，挡不了，
    社会主义往前跑。
    往前跑，跑得快，
    要跟英国来比赛。
    来比赛，十五年，
    我们一定赶上前。
    赶上前，高声唱，
    祖国变得强又强！（附图片）
