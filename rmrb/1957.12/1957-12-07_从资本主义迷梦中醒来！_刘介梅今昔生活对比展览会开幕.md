　  Waking Up from the Capitalist Dream!
　  Liu Jiemei's Past and Present Life Comparison Exhibition Opens
    (Our newspaper reports) The Liu Jiemei Past and Present Life Comparison Exhibition opened at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace on the morning of the 6th.
    In the first part of the exhibition, the audience saw real objects such as clothes and utensils from Liu Jiemei's two different life eras before and after liberation, as well as photos and charts reflecting his journey from forgetting his roots after being emancipated to his ideological transformation.
    In the second part of the exhibition, the audience not only learned about the situation of the struggle between the new and old roads and the dynamics of various classes in the suburbs of Beijing before and after the great airing of views, debates, and discussions, but also saw the false and ugly faces of those who shouted about the lack of food and cloth.
    Next, in the third part of the exhibition, the audience saw the tremendous achievements my country's agricultural production has made since liberation, especially since the collectivization.
    On the morning of the 6th, Liu Jiemei himself also met with some of the audience in the exhibition's cinema, made a public self-criticism, and expressed his determination to fight against his own root-forgetting thoughts and to follow the Communist Party forever.
