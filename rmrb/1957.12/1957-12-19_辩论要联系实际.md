    Debate Must Be Linked to Reality
  　Xin Huan
    The Pricing Bureau of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives took a detour during its rectification campaign. After transitioning from general airing of views to thematic debate, the bureau began debating the organizational structure of the Pricing Bureau. At that time, the leadership lacked a clear understanding of how to link to reality, and simply proposed an organizational plan, asking the masses to debate based on the plan itself. As a result, the masses searched everywhere for relevant state instructions and regulations on pricing to use as a basis, thus limiting the debate to the text of the instructions and regulations, without touching on the actual problems in current pricing work. After debating for a long time, they were unable to continue. Later, the leading group realized that this approach was not correct, so they changed their approach, mobilizing the masses to first expose the shortcomings and problems in the current work of the Pricing Bureau, and then debate the organizational structure. As soon as this was done, the enthusiasm of the masses was greatly aroused, and the discussion was very lively. Problems such as the Pricing Bureau's bloated organization, overstaffing, and the bureaucratic work style of leaders at the section chief level and above were exposed. From the facts that were revealed, both the leaders and the masses saw the crux of the problem, and streamlining the organization and delegating personnel became a natural requirement, and the organizational plan also took shape very naturally. After debate and ideological struggle, it has been preliminarily decided that the bureau will be reduced from the original thirty people to eighteen people, and the leading cadres above the section chief level are determined to change their past bureaucratic style and do some specific work. Now, the entire bureau, from leaders to the masses, is very satisfied with this plan, and those who are to be delegated are also in a good mood.
    The Pricing Bureau's experience illustrates the following point: thematic debates must proceed from the actual situation, starting with exposing the problems and shortcomings existing in actual work, in order to unfold the debate, improve the understanding of leaders and the masses, and also seek a relatively practical solution to the problem. Drawing frames and discussing problems without linking them to reality will not truly unfold the debate and solve the problems.

　　辩论要联系实际
  　辛环
    中华全国供销合作总社物价局在整改中曾经走了一段弯路。这个局在由一般鸣放转入专题辩论后，开始辩论物价局的体制问题。当时领导思想上对联系实际缺乏明确概念，只是提出了编制方案，让群众根据方案本身来辩论。结果群众到处找国家有关物价方面的指示、条文来作根据，因此只限在条文、指示辩论上，没有接触到现在物价工作中的问题，辩论了半天，就无法继续下去。后来领导小组发觉这种做法不对头，就改变作法，动员群众先揭露现在物价局工作中的缺点和问题，然后再辩论机构问题。这样一来，群众情绪大为振奋，讨论的很热烈。物价局机构臃肿、人浮于事、处长以上领导干部的官僚主义作风等问题都被揭露出来。从揭露出来的事实中，领导和群众都看到了问题的症结所在，紧缩机构、下放人员就成为很自然的要求，编制方案也很自然地形成了。经过辩论和思想斗争，已经初步决定这个局由原来的三十人减少到十八个人，处长以上的领导干部都决心改变过去官僚主义的作风，做一部分具体工作。现在，全局从领导到群众都很满意这个方案，要下放的人也心情舒畅。
    物价局的这段经历，说明了这样一个问题：专题辩论必须从实际情况出发，从揭露实际工作中存在的问题和缺点着手，才能展开辩论，才能提高领导和群众的认识，也才能求得问题的比较切实的解决。画框框，就问题谈问题，不联系实际的做法，是不能真正展开辩论解决问题的。
