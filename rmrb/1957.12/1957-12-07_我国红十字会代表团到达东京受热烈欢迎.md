Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 6th: The Chinese Red Cross delegation, led by Li Dequan and Liao Chengzhi, arrived in Tokyo on the evening of December 6th. The delegation is visiting Japan at the invitation of Japanese people's organizations.

　　At Haneda Airport, the delegation was warmly welcomed by representatives of the welcoming committee for the Chinese Red Cross delegation, composed of more than seventy non-governmental organizations, representatives from all walks of life in Japan, and representatives of overseas Chinese, totaling more than a thousand people. Representatives from local assemblies in Hokkaido and local assemblies in Nagoya City also rushed to the airport to welcome the delegation.

　　Ohtani Eijun, Chairman of the welcoming committee for the Chinese Red Cross delegation, delivered a speech, expressing his heartfelt welcome to the Chinese Red Cross delegation. He said that the purpose of the delegation's visit to Japan was to express gratitude to the Japanese people for returning the remains of Chinese martyrs. At the same time, the Japanese side also expressed its heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese Red Cross for assisting in the repatriation of Japanese nationals and released Japanese war criminals. Ohtani said that when we welcome the envoys of peace, friendship and humanitarianism - the Chinese Red Cross delegation - we feel that if we can combine the peace and friendship aspirations of both sides and cooperate with each other, we will surely be able to quickly eliminate the unreasonable state currently standing between the two countries and restore normal diplomatic relations between China and Japan.

　　After Ohtani's speech, representatives of more than forty Japanese organizations presented flowers to the Chinese delegation to pay their respects.

　　Then, Li Dequan, the head of the delegation, delivered a speech. She first thanked the Japanese friends for their invitation and welcome. She then said that in the three years since the first visit of the Chinese Red Cross delegation to Japan, although Japan and China have not yet restored normal relations, the exchanges and contacts between the people of China and Japan and the people's organizations of the two countries have become increasingly frequent and close, and economic and cultural exchanges have also made considerable progress. Our friendship is growing, and our mutual understanding is also deepening. All this is enough to show that the prospects for friendly cooperation between China and Japan are bright. No force can prevent the development of friendship between the people of China and Japan. Li Dequan finally expressed her willingness to work for Sino-Japanese friendship and the defense of peace.

    接着，代表团团长李德全致词，她首先感谢日本朋友们的邀请和欢迎，她接着说，自从中国红十字会代表团第一次访问日本以来的三年里，虽然日本和中国还没有恢复正常关系，但是中日两国人民以及两国人民团体之间的来往和联系是日益频繁、日益密切了，经济和文化的交流也有相当大的进展。我们的友谊日益增进，相互的理解也日益加深，这一切都足以说明，中日两国友好合作的前途是光明的。任何力量都不能阻止中日两国人民友谊的发展。李德全最后表示愿为中日友好和保卫和平而努力。
