Xinhua News Agency, December 31st — The International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam recently submitted its Seventh Interim Report to the two Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference. The report covers the period from August 1, 1956, to April 30, 1957.

    The report reviews the implementation of the Geneva Agreements in Vietnam during these nine months and focuses on the implementation of Article 14(c) (which stipulates that no reprisals or discrimination should be taken against individuals and groups for their activities during the hostilities and guarantees their democratic freedoms), the provisions regarding the demilitarized zone, the provisions regarding the prohibition of the introduction of new troops, military personnel, arms and ammunition and the establishment of new military bases, and the provisions in the Final Declaration regarding consultations between the responsible authorities in both regions on the issue of national elections.

    Regarding the implementation of Article 14(c), the report points out that during this period, the Commission received 194 accusations from the High Command of the Vietnam People's Army and 202 complaints from individuals. These accusations and complaints involved 1,047 cases of murder, detention, arrest, and confiscation of property by the South Vietnamese authorities in violation of Article 14(c). The International Commission has been obstructed by the South Vietnamese authorities for more than a year in its investigation of these large numbers of cases of persecution of former resistance personnel and the people of South Vietnam. The Commission unanimously decided that it could not accept this position of the South Vietnamese authorities in violation of the Geneva Agreements and sent a letter to the two Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference on April 11, 1957, reporting this serious situation.

    Regarding the implementation of the provisions for the demilitarized zone, the report points out that the interruption of the work of the Joint Ceasefire Commission due to the withdrawal of the French side has meant that some important recommendations of the International Commission on the demilitarized zone issue have not yet been implemented by the South Vietnamese authorities. On the other hand, the South Vietnamese authorities have violated the provisions on the demilitarized zone on forty-three occasions, including one occasion when a group of two hundred people (including several Americans) illegally entered the demilitarized zone and reached the Hien Luong Bridge (transliteration). Regarding these violations of the agreement, the South Vietnamese authorities only admitted that a reconnaissance plane had "flown towards" the demilitarized zone but had not flown over the Ben Hai River (military demarcation line). For the above reasons, the report points out that the situation in the demilitarized zone has not improved since the Sixth Interim Report.

    Regarding the implementation of the provisions on the prohibition of the introduction of new troops, military personnel, arms and ammunition and the establishment of new military bases, the report points out that during this period, the Commission encountered a total of ninety-six incidents of violations of Article 16 and one hundred and fourteen incidents of violations of Article 17 by the South Vietnamese side. The Commission made rulings on eight such incidents by the South Vietnamese authorities, considering them to be violations of Articles 16 and 17 of the Agreement respectively. For eighteen other incidents of violations of the agreement, the Commission requested the South Vietnamese authorities to explain why they had not acted in accordance with Article 16, Article 17, or the procedures of Agreement No. 23 between the two parties.

    The report points out that on the side of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, there are no reports, notices, or accusations from the South Vietnamese authorities mentioning any violations of these provisions.

    Regarding the issue of not establishing new military bases, the Commission, based on the accusations of the Vietnam People's Army, prepared to investigate nine new military airfields in South Vietnam, but the South Vietnamese authorities only agreed to investigate one of them. In addition, the Commission requested to supervise the Bien Hoa, Buon Ma Thuot, and Soc Trang airports in South Vietnam, but South Vietnam only agreed to two of them. For Bien Hoa airport, it even refused the Commission's supervision on the pretext that "this is a military airport." The report also points out that the Commission teams stationed in Nha Trang and Da Nang in South Vietnam reported that they were not allowed to supervise American military and other aircraft. The reason given by the South Vietnamese authorities was: "These are the aircraft of the American Embassy." In Saigon, the Commission's team members were not allowed to enter the airfield, so they could not inspect the incoming supplies, nor could they ascertain whether these aircraft entering South Vietnam had all left South Vietnam. Regarding the activities of various American military advisory groups (such as the "Military Assistance Advisory Group," "Temporary Equipment Renovation Group," "Training, Organization, Inspection Group," and "Combat, Weapons, Training Organization," etc.) entering South Vietnam in violation of the Geneva Agreements, although the Commission had repeatedly questioned the South Vietnamese authorities, the South Vietnamese authorities either did not respond or stated that they had entered Vietnam as early as 1950.

    Regarding the issue of consultations between the responsible authorities of the North and South on national elections, the report points out that a major difficulty faced by the Commission is that these consultations and national elections have not yet been held. The report points out that the letters of the two Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference on May 8, 1956, had requested both parties to express their views on when to begin consultations, and had given great attention to maintaining the ceasefire in Vietnam under the supervision of the International Commission, but there has been no progress in this regard. The report points out that the Commission is naturally concerned about this, because the duration of the Commission's existence depends on the political settlement of Vietnam.

    The report concludes by pointing out that although there are many difficulties mentioned above, the Commission will continue to maintain and strengthen peace in Vietnam on the basis of the implementation of the Geneva Agreements, as instructed by the two Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference, so that Vietnam can be unified through free national elections. The Commission is pleased that the war in Vietnam has not re-erupted during the period covered by the report, but it requests the two Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference and other countries participating in the Geneva Conference to consider as soon as possible the difficulties raised in the report and take the steps they deem appropriate so that the Geneva Agreements can be effectively implemented.

    越南国际委员会第七次临时报告指出
    日内瓦协议受到南越和美国破坏
    希望日内瓦会议参加国采取适当步骤
    新华社31日讯　驻越南国际监察和监督委员会最近向日内瓦会议两位主席提交了第七次临时报告。报告所涉及的期间自1956年8月1日起至1957年4月30日止。
    报告回顾了这九个月内日内瓦协议在越南执行的情况，并着重地叙述了关于第十四条丙款（这一款规定不得因个人和团体在敌对行动期间的活动而对其加以任何报复和歧视，并保障其民主自由）、关于非军事区的条款、关于禁止进入新的部队、军事人员、武器弹药和不得建立新的军事基地的条款、以及最后宣言中关于双方地区有代表性的负责当局就全国选举问题进行协商的规定等实施情况。
    关于第十四条丙款的实施情况，报告指出，在此期间委员会收到越南人民军总司令部一百九十四次指控和来自个人的二百零二件控诉书。这些指控和控诉书涉及南越当局一千零四十七次违反第十四条丙款进行谋杀、扣留、逮捕和没收财产的案件。对于这些大量迫害前抗战人员和南越人民的案件，国际委员会遭到南越当局的各种阻挠已经有一年以上而无法进行调查。委员会一致决定不能接受南越当局的这种违反日内瓦协议的立场，并已于1957年4月11日致函日内瓦会议两位主席，报告这一严重情况。
    关于非军事区条款的实施情况，报告指出，由于法方退出联合停战委员会而使该委员会工作中断的情况，使得国际委员会关于非军事区问题的一些重要建议至今仍未为南越当局所执行，而另一方面南越当局曾经四十三次违反关于非军事区的条款，其中有一次人数达二百人（包括几个美国人在内），非法进入非军事区并到达贤良桥（译音）。对于这些违反协议的事件，南越当局只承认一架侦察机曾经“飞向”非军事区但未飞越边海河（军事分界线）。由于上述原因，报告指出，非军事区的情况自从第六次临时报告以来没有任何改进。
    关于禁止进入新的部队、军事人员、武器弹药和不得建立新的军事基地等条款的实施情况，报告指出，委员会在此期间一共碰到南越方面九十六件违反第十六条的事件和一百一十四件违反第十七条的事件。委员会曾经对南越当局八次这样的事件作出判语，认为它们是分别违反协定第十六和第十七条的，对于其他十八件违反协议的事件，委员会要求南越当局解释为什么它没有依照第十六、第十七条或双方第二十三号协议程序办事。
    报告指出：在越南民主共和国方面，没有任何委员会小组的报告、通告或者来自南越当局的指控提到它有任何违反这些条款的事件。
    关于不得建立新的军事基地问题，委员会曾经根据越南人民军的指控，准备调查南越九个新的军用飞机场，但是南越当局只同意调查其中一个。此外，委员会曾要求监督南越的边和、邦美蜀和朔庄三机场，但南越只同意其中两个，对于边和机场，它竟以“此系军用机场”为借口拒绝委员会的监督。报告还指出，委员会驻在南越芽庄和土伦的小组曾经报告说，他们未被允许监督美国的军用和其他飞机，南越当局的理由是：“这些是美国大使馆的飞机”。在西贡，委员会的小组人员未被允许进入停机场，以致他们无法对于运入的物资进行视察，也无法确知是否这些进入南越的飞机都已飞离南越。对于美国违反日内瓦协议进入南越的各种军事顾问团（诸如“军事援助顾问团”、“临时装备翻新团”、“训练、组织、视察团”和“战斗、武器、训练组织”等）在南越的活动，虽然委员会曾经一再询问南越当局，但南越当局或者不予答复，或者表示他们早在1950年就已进入越南。
    关于北南双方负责当局就全国选举进行协商问题，报告指出，委员会所面临的一项重大困难就是该项协商和全国选举至今未能举行。报告指出：日内瓦会议两位主席1956年5月8日的信件曾经要求双方对于何时开始进行协商表示意见，并且对于在国际委员会监察下维持越南的停战给予极大的关注，而这方面至今没有进展。报告指出，委员会对此当然表示关心，因为委员会的存在期限取决于越南的政治解决。
    报告在结论中指出：虽然存在上述许多困难，委员会将如日内瓦会议两位主席所指示的，继续在实施日内瓦协议的基础上维持和加强越南的和平，以便越南经过全国的自由选举得到统一。委员会对于在报告所涉及的期间越南并未重新发生战争表示欣慰，但是它要求日内瓦会议两位主席和参加日内瓦会议的其他国家早日考虑报告中所提出的困难和采取他们认为适当的步骤以便日内瓦协议得以有效实施。
