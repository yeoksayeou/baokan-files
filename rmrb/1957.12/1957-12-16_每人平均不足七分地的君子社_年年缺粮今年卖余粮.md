Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Junzi Agricultural Cooperative in Gutian Township, Zizhong County, Sichuan Province, with an average of less than seven fen of land per person, has fundamentally changed its situation of annual grain shortages by vigorously building water conservancy projects and increasing yields per unit area. This year, it even sold 45,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. The grain distributed to each member exceeded that of some neighboring agricultural cooperatives with more land. In the past month or so, more than 3,000 people have visited this cooperative, greatly encouraging many other agricultural cooperatives. 135 agricultural cooperatives in Zizhong County have already drawn up plans to learn from the Junzi Cooperative.

The Junzi Cooperative has 101 households with 467 people, possessing only 316 mu of cultivated land, all of which is hilly. In the past, without water conservancy facilities, they relied entirely on the paddy fields themselves to store water. All paddy fields could only be planted once a year, and even that single crop would fail in case of drought. Due to the small amount of land and low yields, the state had to supply 30,000 to 40,000 jin of grain every year. Many members even lost confidence in improving their lives by relying on the land, and more than 70 households left to seek other means of livelihood. In the early stage of establishing the cooperative in 1954, the members originally wanted to solve their difficulties by expanding the cultivated area, but there was no wasteland to be reclaimed here. They only reclaimed four mu of land from the edges of fields, corners of land, and sides of ditches. Over the past three years, the entire cooperative has built one large Shanwan pond, seven reservoirs, and renovated two Ping ponds. More than 90% of the paddy fields can now be irrigated by gravity flow. On this basis, they gradually changed from planting one crop a year to planting two and three crops. This year, the cooperative achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with an average grain yield of more than 1,200 jin per mu. Before joining the cooperative, the highest yield per unit area of local wealthy middle peasants was only over 900 jin.

Now the Junzi Cooperative also feels a shortage of labor. The vast majority of members who had left have returned to the cooperative for production. The cooperative plans to convert all paddy fields to three crops next year, increasing the multiple cropping index to 300%, continue to increase the yield per unit area, and strive to sell more surplus grain to the state.

### 每人平均不足七分地的君子社  年年缺粮今年卖余粮

    每人平均不足七分地的君子社
    年年缺粮今年卖余粮
    据新华社讯　平均每人不到七分田地的四川资中县谷田乡君子农业社，由于大力兴修水利，提高单位产量，已根本上改变了年年缺粮的状况，今年还卖给国家四万五千斤余粮，社员每人分得的粮食超过了附近一些地多的农业社。最近一个多月内，前来这个社参观的已有三千多人，许多农业社受到很大鼓舞。资中县已有一百三十五个农业社订出计划，向君子社学习。
    君子社共有一百零一户，四百六十七人，只有耕地三百一十六亩，全部是丘陵地。过去没有水利设施，全靠稻田本身蓄水，全部水田一年只能种一季，稍遇干旱连一季也种不上。由于地少产量低，年年要由国家供应三、四万斤粮食，不少社员甚至对依靠土地改善生活失去信心，有七十多户人外出另谋出路。1954年建社初期，社员们原想从扩大耕地面积解决困难，但这里没有荒地可开，他们从田埂、地角、沟边只开出四亩地。三年多来，全社兴修了一口大山湾塘，七个蓄水池，整修了两口平塘。90％以上的稻田都能做到自流灌溉。在这个基础上，他们逐步由一年种一季改种两季和三季。今年这个社获得空前丰收，平均每亩产粮一千二百多斤。而当地富裕中农入社前最高单位产量，也只有九百多斤。
    现在君子社还感到劳动力不足。绝大多数外出的社员返回社生产。这个社准备明年把全部水田都改种三季，复种指数提高为300％，继续提高单位面积产量，争取卖更多的余粮给国家。
