Following the Mass Line
　　——A Sideline Account of the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions
　　By Our Staff Reporter

　　At the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, whether in Comrade Lai Ruoyu's report or in the representatives' speeches and group discussions, a common understanding was mentioned: trade union work must adhere to the mass line.

　　Lin Jingyun, a representative from Liaoning Province, is the deputy mine manager and chief engineer of the Victory Mine of the Fushun Mining Bureau. From the perspective of technical work, he deeply feels the necessity of following the mass line. Lin Jingyun said: "Production is a mass activity; without the conscious action of the masses, production cannot be done well. Take our Victory Mine as an example. It is not considered a large mine in Fushun, but it has more than 7,000 employees and a working face of more than 1,000 meters long. And what about the technical personnel? There are only over 100 people. Including the technical personnel doing administrative work, there are only over 300 people. This is the figure before the current institutional streamlining. After the institutional streamlining and the transfer of cadres to lower levels, the number of technical personnel will definitely decrease a lot. With so few technical personnel, how can we carry out work among more than 7,000 employees and on a working face of more than 1,000 meters long, how can we ensure safety, and how can we extract more coal and rock from the ground? The only way is to follow the mass line."

　　Lin Jingyun told reporters: The Victory Mine once had a record of 17 months without major accidents, and once had a mining area that eliminated major accidents for 45 months. This had never happened in the 50-year history of the Victory Mine. As for output, the Victory Mine under the rule of the Kuomintang produced only over 100 tons per day, which was not even enough to burn boilers. Now the daily output of the Victory Mine has increased to more than 5,000 tons. How were these achievements obtained? Lin Jingyun said: "In a word, it is the result of mobilizing the masses under the leadership of the Party. Among them, the trade union, as a mass organization of the working class, has played a great role in implementing the mass line, educating and organizing employees."

　　As we listened to the representatives from all over the country talking about their work at the meeting, and when we went to visit many of the representatives present, we deeply felt that the representatives had a deep understanding of the issue of "following the mass line" and were all striving to explore experiences in this regard.

　　How can we better implement the mass line? Many representatives said that in addition to establishing a mass viewpoint ideologically, the most important thing is to strengthen contact with the masses and live among them. Only when every trade union cadre is as familiar with the workers as they are with their own brothers and sisters can trade union work be done well. Lu Xianglin, a driller from Taixin No. 3 Mine of the Liaoyuan Mining Bureau, who attended the conference, has been continuously elected as the trade union group leader since 1953. What is Lu Xianglin's experience? He said very simply: "There are more than 20 people in our group. I work and study with them; after work, I often visit their homes. I know how many people are in each family, which direction the door of each house faces, who has any worries, and what happens in each family. In this way, the work is easy to do." The relationship between Lu Xianglin and his group members, and between Lu Xianglin and the families of his group members, is very close. Lu Xianglin discusses things with everyone when he has something to do, and everyone also consults with Lu Xianglin when they have something to do. In the face of such a trade union group, there are no insurmountable difficulties. In last year's advanced producer movement, the group decided to have advanced producer Zhang Jingzhi help Mao Guichun, who was relatively backward in production at the time. Zhang Jingzhi helped Mao Guichun, who was drilling less coal, and said: "You have to improve your drilling technique. The amount of coal you are breaking down is too little." Unexpectedly, Mao Guichun only hummed and retorted: "Others are breaking more. Don't you want others to do it? I don't want to do it anyway." If he was asked to help others with some work, he would also say: "I don't have that technology, and I didn't earn that money." Why was Mao Guichun's attitude so stubborn? It turned out that Zhang Jingzhi's working method had problems. He talked a lot, criticized a lot, and gave little concrete help. Mao Guichun was not convinced in his heart. The old worker Liu Shuzhi had good technology, and everyone hoped to learn technology from him, but he was unwilling to teach. Why was Liu Shuzhi so conservative? It turned out that this old worker had a bad temper and would glare at people at the slightest provocation. He was holding a bellyful of anger: "Learn from me? A body of bad temper," "This is the bones and flesh I was born with, I can't be advanced." These various ideological situations and practical problems, through daily interactions, through production, study, eating, walking, resting, chatting together, through holiday visits, and even because they were so familiar with each other, through a gesture, a foot movement, and a silent expression, were all grasped by Lu Xianglin. Using different keys to open different locks, using different content and methods to solve different ideological problems and practical problems, he mobilized the entire group ideologically, and various tasks and systems were easily implemented.

　　Strengthening the work of trade union activists and giving full play to the role of trade union activists is an important method for trade union work to implement the mass line. Cao Guifang, a female worker and trade union group leader from the state-owned Northwest No. 1 Textile Factory, told reporters that their group was able to do a relatively good job and was rated as a national textile industry model group. Since 1952, they have been able to comprehensively complete the national plan, increasing cotton yarn production by more than 100 pieces for the country and saving more than 1,000 kilograms of white cotton. This is inseparable from relying on activists to carry out work. According to the nature of the work and the personal characteristics and hobbies, the group clarified the division of labor for activists. Ren Xiuyun is gentle and kind in handling affairs, so she serves as the group's labor protection officer; Li Huiqing is highly educated, good at speaking and singing, and lively, so she serves as the group's cultural and sports propaganda officer; Zhang Yufeng's handwriting is clear and her records are careful. She likes to take notes during meetings, and everyone is satisfied with her notes. Zhang Yufeng is responsible for recording the group's meetings. Zhang Yufeng is also very enthusiastic and everyone calls her "the errand runner," so some administrative matters are also entrusted to her. Because attention is paid to giving play to the role of activists, more people are doing trade union work, and the work in all aspects of the group can be arranged more properly, everyone gets along very harmoniously, feels the warmth of the collective, and their production enthusiasm is always full. Cao Guifang said: "Of course, it is not enough to just do these things. We must also pay attention to educating activists to play a leading role in production and in various movements." She told us about such a thing: Back in February 1955, in order to reduce electricity consumption and reduce yarn breakage, the group production meeting resolved that the doffers should clean the suction cotton box twice for each doffing, and knead the cotton into a ball in the box before taking it out to avoid dropping the cotton on the ground and losing effective fibers. However, at the beginning, some comrades found it troublesome and were unwilling to implement it. At this time, the group decided to let Liu Xiuhua and Song Chunying, who had prestige among the masses, take the lead in implementing it, and explained to them the importance of this for promoting everyone's implementation of this resolution. Liu Xiuhua and Song Chunying happily accepted this task. They cleaned the suction cotton box very cleanly, not only was the work easy to do, but the yarn breakage was also reduced, and the plan was completed very well. The facts educated everyone, and later all the comrades in the group consciously implemented the resolutions of the production meeting.

　　Many representatives also talked about the new development of the mass line, which is the establishment of the system of employee representative congresses under the leadership of the Party committee and the socialist democratic methods such as great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters that have emerged since the rectification campaign. The system of employee representative congresses is a system that better implements the mass line and widely attracts employees to participate in enterprise management. This system has been proven by the practice of many enterprises to have unlimited vitality. Qi Tinghan, chairman of the trade union of Factory 53, once talked at the conference about how they used the employee representative congress to attract the broad masses of employees to participate in enterprise management. The employee representative congress of this factory often studies key production issues, clarifies the goals of struggle, and not only puts forward criticisms and supervises administrative work, but also puts forward active suggestions and assists the administration in improving its work. These have played a great role in promoting socialist democracy, implementing the mass line, and running socialist enterprises well. The socialist democratic forms such as great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters that have emerged since the rectification campaign have given the representatives deep inspiration. How many old problems that had not been solved for a long time were solved in the great airing of views and rectification! Many representatives talked about how many problems that had always been considered difficult to solve were solved by the masses. Many representatives said that the method of rectification should be made a regular working method.

　　Of course, the mass line in trade union work has attracted widespread attention and has accumulated some successful experiences, which does not mean that there are no problems in this regard. In a group discussion, Xu Bingkun, chairman of the Shenyang No. 1 Machinery Trade Union, once talked about some shortcomings of trade union work itself. He said: "The phenomena of bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism that are divorced from the masses and divorced from reality also exist in trade union work. Only by overcoming these shortcomings can trade union work be improved." Wang Jiong, a representative from Beijing and chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, also emphasized in his speech at the conference some problems in the implementation of the mass line in trade union work. They all expressed that they must, with the assistance and supervision of the broad masses, earnestly solve the problem of further implementing the mass line from the aspects of work style, work methods, and organizational construction.

　　走群众路线
　　——中国工会第八次全国代表大会侧记
    本报记者
    在中国工会第八次全国代表大会上，不论是赖若愚同志的报告，不论是代表们的大会发言和小组讨论，都曾提到一个共同的认识：工会工作必须坚持群众路线。
    辽宁省的代表林景云，是抚顺矿务局胜利矿的副矿长兼总工程师。他从技术工作的角度出发，深感走群众路线的必要。林景云说：“生产是群众性的活动；离开了群众自觉的行动，生产是搞不好的。拿我们胜利矿来说，在抚顺不算是大矿，但也有七千多名职工，一千多公尺长的掌子面。而技术人员呢？只一百多人，包括做行政工作的技术人员在内，也不过三百多人。这还是现在机构没有精减时的数字，等机构精减、干部下放之后，技术人员的数目肯定还会减少很多。这么少的技术人员，在七千多名职工当中，在一千多公尺长的掌子面上，怎样开展工作，怎样保证安全，怎样把更多的煤岩从地底下开采出来呢？唯一的办法，就是走群众路线。”
    林景云告诉记者：胜利矿曾经出现过十七个月没有出重大事故的记录，曾经出现过四十五个月消灭了重大事故的矿区。这在胜利矿开矿五十年的历史上是从来不曾有过的。至于产量，国民党统治时的胜利矿，日产一百多吨，连烧锅炉都不够，现在胜利矿的日产量已提高到五千多吨。这些成绩是怎样取得的呢？林景云说：“一句话，是在党的领导下，发动群众的结果。这当中，工会作为工人阶级的一个群众性的组织，在贯彻群众路线，教育职工和组织职工方面，起了很大的作用。”
    当我们在会场上聆听来自全国各地的代表们畅谈自己的工作时，当我们去走访到会的许多代表时，我们深深地感到，“走群众路线”这个问题，代表们是有深刻的体会的，并且无一不在努力摸索这方面的经验。
    怎样才能更好地贯彻群众路线呢？许多代表都谈到，除了思想上树立群众观点以外，最重要的，就是加强同群众的联系，生活在群众中间。只有当每一个工会干部，熟悉工人像熟悉自己的兄弟姐妹一样时，工会工作才能做好。出席这次大会的代表，辽源矿务局泰信三坑的打眼工卢相林，从1953年起就连续当选为工会小组长。卢相林的经验是什么呢？他说得很朴素：“我们组二十多个人。我同他们一起工作，一起学习；下了班，常在他们家串门。谁家有多少人，谁家的门冲那儿开；谁有什么心事，谁家出了什么事儿，我都知道。这样，工作就好做了。”卢相林和他的小组成员之间，和他的小组成员家属之间，都是亲密无间的。卢相林有事就同大家商量，大家有事也找卢相林商量。在这样的工会小组面前，就没有什么不可克服的困难。去年的先进生产者运动中，组里确定由先进生产者张敬之帮助当时在生产上还比较落后的毛贵春。毛贵春打的眼崩的煤少，张敬之帮助他说：“你得改进打眼技术，崩下的煤太少了。”不料毛贵春只哼了一声，反说：“别人崩的多，你不好让别人干吗？我正不愿干哪。”要是让毛贵春帮助别人干点活，他也说：“我没有那个技术，也没挣那份钱”。为什么毛贵春的态度这么倔强呢？原来张敬之的工作方法有问题，他是说得多，批评多，具体帮助少，毛贵春心里不服气。老工人刘树之技术好，大家希望向他学习技术，但他却不愿意教。为什么刘树之这样保守呢？原来这位老工人脾气大，动不动就瞪眼睛，群众关系不大好。他正别着一肚皮的气：“跟我学啥？一身的脾气”、“我这是生成的骨头长成的肉，先进不了”。这些形形色色的思想情况和实际问题，通过日常相处，通过在一起生产、学习、吃饭、走路、休息、闲谈，通过假日的拜访，甚至由于相处得太熟悉了，通过一举手，一投足和一个无言的表情，统通被卢相林掌握住了。用不同的钥匙去开不同的锁，用不同的内容和方法去解决不同的思想问题和实际问题，就把全组从思想上发动起来，各项工作，各种制度都容易贯彻了。
    加强工会积极分子工作，充分发挥工会积极分子的作用，是工会工作贯彻群众路线的一个重要方法。国营西北第一纺织厂女工，工会小组长曹桂芳告诉记者，她们的小组能够搞得比较好，被评为全国纺织工业模范小组，从1952年到现在都能全面地完成国家计划，共给国家增产棉纱一百多件，节约白花一千多公斤，是同依靠积极分子进行工作分不开的。这个小组根据工作性质和个人的特长、爱好，明确积极分子的分工。任秀云性情温和，处事亲切，就由她担任组里的劳保干事；李慧清文化程度较高，善说爱唱，性情也活泼，就由她担任组里的文体宣传干事；张玉凤字迹清楚，记录仔细。开会时，她爱记；她记的，大家也满意。小组开会的记录工作就由张玉凤担负起来。张玉凤办事也很热心，大家叫她“爱跑腿”，有些事务事情也就交给她去办。由于注意发挥了积极分子的作用，有更多的人来做工会工作，组里各方面的工作能够安排得比较妥贴，大家相处得很融洽，感到集体的温暖，生产情绪总是饱满的。曹桂芳说：“当然，仅仅做到这些还不够，还要注意教育积极分子在生产中，在各种运动中起带头作用。”她告诉我们这样一件事情：那还是1955年的2月，为了减少用电，减少断头，小组生产会议决议要落纱工每落纱掏两次吸棉箱，并在箱内把花揉成一团再掏出，避免把花掉在地上和飞落有效纤维。可是开始的时候，一部分同志嫌麻烦，不愿意执行。这时，组里就确定让在群众中有威信的刘秀花和宋春英带头执行，向她们说明这对于推动大家执行这个决议的重要意义。刘秀花和宋春英愉快地接受了这个任务，她们把吸棉箱掏得干干净净的，不仅活好做，断头也减少了，计划完成得很好。事实教育了大家，后来全组同志都自觉地贯彻了生产会议的决议。
    许多代表还谈到群众路线的新的发展，这就是建立党委领导下的职工代表大会制度和整风以来所出现的大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报等社会主义民主的方法。职工代表大会制度是一个更好地贯彻群众路线，广泛地吸引职工群众参加企业管理的制度。这个制度已经被许多企业的实践，证明是具有无限的生命力的。五三工厂工会主席齐廷汉曾经在大会上谈到他们是怎样运用职工代表大会，吸引广大职工参加企业管理的。这个工厂的职工代表大会经常研究生产关键问题，明确奋斗目标，并且不只是对行政工作提出批评、进行监督，还提出积极的建议，协助行政改进工作。这些，对于发扬社会主义民主，贯彻群众路线，办好社会主义企业，起了很大的作用。整风以来所出现的大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报等社会主义民主的形式，给代表们深刻的启发。在大放大鸣、边整边改中，解决了多少长期没有解决的老问题呵！有多少个一向被认为很难解决的问题，群众给出了主意解决了。许多代表都谈到，应该把整风的方法成为一种经常的工作方法。
    当然，工会工作中的群众路线已经引起广泛的注意，并且积累了一些成功的经验，并不等于说这方面就没有什么问题了。在一次小组讨论中，沈阳第一机械工会主席徐炳坤曾经谈到工会工作本身的一些缺点，他说：“脱离群众，脱离实际的官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义现象，在工会工作中也是存在的。只有克服这些缺点，工会工作才能提高。”北京市的代表、北京市工会联合会主席王炯在大会发言中，也曾着重谈到工会工作在贯彻群众路线上存在的一些问题。他们都表示一定要在广大群众的协助和监督下，从工作作风上，工作方法上和组织建设上，认真解决进一步贯彻群众路线的问题。
