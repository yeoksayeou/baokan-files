"Everyone's Talk" is truly a garden for the masses to confide in each other
　　Since December 2nd, the "Everyone's Talk" column has frequently appeared on page eight of your newspaper for everyone to see. Whether it is a housewife, a student, or a resident, they can express their opinions on everything from major world events and social issues to family life in this column. In our lives, we always have some feelings and experiences, and even many questions. We really want to talk about our feelings and also hope to hear other people's opinions. However, because these opinions are often fragmented and small, we always suffer from the fact that there is no small garden in the newspaper that can allow us to express these miscellaneous feelings in an informal way and spark some discussion. And the "Everyone's Talk" column meets our requirements. I hope that "Everyone's Talk" will become regular in the future, and it would be even better if it could be published every day.

### “大家谈”真是群众谈心的园地

　　“大家谈”真是群众谈心的园地
    从12月2日以来，“大家谈”这一栏就经常在你报八版同大家见面了。无论是家庭主妇，还是学生或居民，都可以在这一栏里发表自己从天下大事、社会问题一直到家庭生活的大小意见。在我们的生活中，总多少有些感想和体会，甚至还有很多疑问。我们很想谈谈自己的感受，也希望听听别人的议论。但是，由于这些意见往往是零碎的，细小的，总是苦于报上没有一块小小的园地，能够让我们不拘形式地抒发这些杂感，并且引起一些讨论。而“大家谈”一栏，满足了我们的要求。希望今后“大家谈”经常化起来，如果每天都有就更好了。
