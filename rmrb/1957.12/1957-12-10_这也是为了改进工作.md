　　This Is Also To Improve Work
　　The rectification work of the current Ministry of Coal Industry has differences from the practices of other departments. That is, while carrying out general rectification, it uses greater force to criticize the ideological and work style problems of some leading cadres. According to the steps of the movement, the third stage of the rectification campaign, after full airing of views, enters into general rectification, picking up "sesame seeds," sweeping away the "periphery," and then starting the rectification of major problems. This approach is suitable for general situations and can make the rectification keep up with the airing of views. Experience has proved that this step is correct.

　　However, the general does not exclude the particular, and special circumstances require special steps. During the airing of views period of the Ministry of Coal Industry, the masses raised many sharp criticisms against the ideological and work styles of some Party member leading cadres (including four bureau directors and eight section chiefs). Because these Party member leading cadres hold more important positions and have a greater impact on the work and the masses, if measures are not taken immediately and it is allowed to cool down, it will inevitably hinder the enthusiasm of the masses to air their views, and the rectification work will also encounter difficulties. Therefore, the rectification leading group of the Ministry of Coal Industry decided to mobilize the masses to continue to expose and criticize, using this practical action to show the determination of the leadership to rectify. This approach has had a very good effect: it has once again set off a high tide of airing of views, the masses have also been educated in the exposure and criticism, and at the same time, it has promoted the general rectification work.

　　The purpose of the rectification campaign is to improve thinking, improve work style, and improve work. The steps of rectification are generally from easy to difficult, first picking sesame seeds, then embracing watermelons. However, as long as it does not violate the purpose, it can be changed according to the specific situation. The significance of the approach of the Ministry of Coal Industry lies here.

　  这也是为了改进工作
    当前煤炭工业部的整改工作，有与其他部门的作法不同的地方，这就是，在进行一般整改的同时，用更大力量批判一部分领导干部的思想作风问题。按照运动的步骤，整风第三阶段，大鸣大放之后，就进入一般整改，拣掉“芝麻”，扫清“外围”，然后开始重大问题的整改。这种作法，适用于一般情况，能使整改跟上鸣放。经验证明这种步骤是正确的。
    但是，一般并不排斥特殊，特殊情况需要采取特殊步骤。煤炭工业部在鸣放期间，群众对一些党员领导干部（其中司局长四名，处长八名）的思想作风提出了许多尖锐的批评。由于这些党员领导干部担负着较重要的职务，对工作和对群众的影响较大，如果不立即采取措施而冷淡下来，势必妨害群众的鸣放热情，整改工作也将会遇到困难。因此，煤炭工业部整风领导小组确定发动群众继续进行揭发批判，用这种实际行动表明领导整改的决心。这种作法，效果很好：再一次掀起鸣放高潮，在揭发批判中群众也受到了教育，同时推动了一般整改工作。
    整风的目的是提高思想，改进作风，改进工作。整改的步骤一般是先易后难，先拣芝麻，后抱西瓜。但是，只要不违背目的，可以根据具体情况而有所变更。煤炭工业部的作法的意义就在这里。
