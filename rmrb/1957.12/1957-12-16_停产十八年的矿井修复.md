Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, December 15th: The Majiagou mine of the Kailuan Coal Mine, which had been shut down for eighteen years, has been completely restored and was officially handed over for production on the 15th.

The Majiagou mine was built in 1908. During the imperialist rule of Kailuan, the miners of this mine, under the leadership of the Communist Party, carried out many heroic strikes. In January 1936, in order to cope with the workers' strike struggle, the imperialists moved the machines away, dispersed the workers, and cruelly allowed the entire mine to be flooded.

    停产十八年的矿井修复
    据新华社唐山15日电　停产十八年的开滦煤矿马家沟矿井已经完全恢复，并在15日正式移交生产。
    马家沟矿建于1908年。在帝国主义统治开滦时期，这个矿的矿工们在共产党领导下进行过许多次英勇的罢工斗争。1936年1月，帝国主义者为了对付工人的罢工斗争，搬走机器，驱散工人，狠心地让积水淹没了整个矿井。
