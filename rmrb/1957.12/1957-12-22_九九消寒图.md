Nine-Nine Cold Dissipation Chart
Xi Ming

In Chinese folklore, there is a custom of "Counting Nine from the Winter Solstice," which means starting from the second day of the Winter Solstice (some start from the Winter Solstice itself), with every nine days counted as one "Nine," totaling nine "Nines," which is eighty-one days. There are many folk proverbs in various regions about "Counting Nine." For example, in Shandong and Hebei, they say: "In the first and second Nines, hands can't stretch out; in the third and fourth Nines, walk on ice; in the fifth and sixth Nines, watch the willows across the river; in the seventh Nine, the river opens; in the eighth Nine, the geese come; in the ninth Nine, eighty-one, cook at home and eat in the fields." These kinds of folk proverbs are easy to remember and are quite useful for calculating climate changes after the Winter Solstice.

These folk proverbs can also be considered a kind of "phenological indicator." Cadres engaged in agricultural production in the countryside may wish to try this method to pay attention to observing and mastering natural phenomena and the laws of agricultural production.

Some people feel that although the method of "Counting Nine" is easy to remember, they often forget which "Nine" it is. There is an interesting method in Chinese folklore, which is to draw a "Nine-Nine Cold Dissipation Chart."

The earliest "Nine-Nine Cold Dissipation Chart" was a simple plum blossom branch with eighty-one petals, and one petal was colored in each day. From the already colored petals, one can immediately see which Nine it is. Later, some people used nine characters, each with nine strokes, to form a phrase to replace it. For example: "Willows droop before the court, cherish and await the spring breeze."

Here, I have tried to draft two Cold Dissipation Chart phrases for everyone's reference:

(1) Study and train hard to always maintain the champion (the character "学" [xué - study] is nine strokes, and the characters "炼" [liàn - train] and "总" [zǒng - always] use simplified characters).
(2) Plant trees behind and in front of the house to block wind and sand (the characters "树" [shù - tree] and "挡" [dǎng - block] use simplified characters).

You can choose one of these phrases and write it on paper with a pencil, then trace one stroke with a pen each day; or you can write it with a pen and trace the strokes with a red pen.

    九九消寒图
    习明
    我国民间有“冬至数九”的习俗，就是从冬至的第二天数起（也有的从冬至这一天数起），每九天算做一九，一共九个九，前后八十一天。各地有许多关于“数九”的农谚，例如山东、河北一带是这样说：“一九二九伸不出手；三九四九冰凌上走；五九六九隔河看柳；七九河开；八九雁来；九九八十一，家里做饭地里吃”。这类的农谚很容易记忆，对于计算冬至以后这一段气候的变化颇有用处。
    这类的农谚也可以算是一种“候应”。下乡从事农业生产的干部，无妨试用一下这个办法，来注意观察和掌握自然现象和农业生产的规律。
    有人感到“数九”的办法虽然好记，但是记着记着就忘了是哪一“九”了。我国民间有一种有趣的办法，就是画一个“九九消寒图”。
    “九九消寒图”在最早是画素梅一枝，八十一个瓣，一天染一个瓣。从已染的花瓣上，就可以马上看出当天是几九天了。后来就有人用九个都是九画的字编成一句词来代替。例如：“庭前垂柳珍重待春风”。
    这里，试着拟了两个消寒图词，供大家参考：
    （1）苦学苦炼总保持冠军（学字做九画，炼字、总字用简体）。
    （2）庭前屋后种树挡风砂（树字、挡字用简体）。
  可以选择其中一句用铅笔写在纸上，每天用钢笔描一画；也可以用钢笔写上，用红笔描画。
