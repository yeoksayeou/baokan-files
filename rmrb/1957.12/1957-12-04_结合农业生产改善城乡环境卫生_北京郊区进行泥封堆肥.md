Combining Agricultural Production to Improve Urban and Rural Environmental Sanitation
　　Beijing Suburbs Conduct Mud-Sealed Composting

(Our dispatch) In order to combine with the fertilizer accumulation campaign, eliminate breeding grounds for flies, and improve urban and rural environmental sanitation, Beijing is preparing to vigorously promote the experience of mud-sealed composting. Recently, the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee organized district heads, agricultural cooperative directors, and agricultural and health science workers to visit the Xibalizhuang Fertilizer Accumulation Station in Haidian District and the small-scale composting sites in Tiancun Township, Shijingshan District, to study the experience of agricultural cooperatives there in combining agricultural production with sanitation work.

The "mud-sealed composting" in Xibalizhuang involves piling organic waste (such as rotten cotton, rags, fish and meat bones, vegetable leaves, etc.) to a height of more than one foot, then pouring a layer of manure on top, followed by another layer of garbage, and another layer of manure. During the piling process, a small amount of horse manure is mixed in, and ventilation pipes are inserted until the pile becomes nine zhang long, one zhang and two chi wide, and more than one person tall. Then a small ditch is dug around the pile, water is added to mix mud, and the fertilizer pile is sealed with mud on the spot. It is said that it can be used after two months in summer and three months in winter.

This kind of mud-sealed composting also has certain scientific principles. In addition to preventing the dissipation of nitrogen in the manure due to the mud seal, thus preserving fertility, the temperature and humidity in the fertilizer pile are moderate, and the air is sufficient. A kind of *yuanping* bacteria contained in the horse manure in the fertilizer pile proliferates in large quantities. The high temperature formed by the reproduction of *yuanping* bacteria (generally reaching 70 degrees Celsius) can kill fly pupae, insects and other bacteria in the fertilizer pile. The organic matter in the fertilizer pile is also broken down into fine particles due to the reproduction of *yuanping* bacteria and other reasons. In the case of mud sealing, such high temperatures can be maintained for a week, so mud-sealed composting is both hygienic and can increase production.

The Balizhuang Fertilizer Accumulation Station was established in August this year. Now eleven agricultural cooperatives have joined this fertilizer accumulation station. Because the fertilizer treated with mud sealing has high fertility and low cost, the members have accumulated more than 20 million *jin* of fertilizer in the past few months. The fertilizer accumulation station is like a freight yard at a train station, with fertilizer piles neatly arranged from east to west. The area around the fertilizer piles is also very clean. People walk back and forth in the middle of the fertilizer piles, and they can neither smell the stench nor encounter flies, which is very different from the fertilizer that was not sealed with mud in the past.

The operation method of the small-scale mud-sealed composting site in Tiancun Township, Shijingshan District is the same as the large-scale mud-sealed composting in Xibalizhuang, except that the fertilizer pile is smaller, only three *chi* square. They use organic waste, pig manure, and pigpen soil from their own homes.

Currently, there are nine sites in the eastern suburbs, Fengtai, Nanyuan and other suburbs of Beijing that are conducting large-scale mud-sealed composting experiments. Organic waste, which accounts for half of the city's garbage, is used to accumulate fertilizer; inorganic waste, such as coal cinder, is also used to fill dead water pits. At present, the method of classifying organic waste and inorganic waste and concentrating it for cleaning every other day, which is being implemented in Beijing, has created extremely favorable conditions for vigorously promoting the experience of mud-sealed composting and combining agricultural production to improve urban and rural environmental sanitation.

### 结合农业生产改善城乡环境卫生　北京郊区进行泥封堆肥

　  结合农业生产改善城乡环境卫生
　　北京郊区进行泥封堆肥
    本报讯　为了结合积肥运动，消灭苍蝇孳生地，改善城乡环境卫生状况，北京市准备大力推广泥封堆肥的经验。最近，北京市爱国卫生运动委员会曾经组织各区区长、农业社主任和农业、卫生科学工作者参观京郊海淀区西八里庄积肥站和石景山区田村乡小型堆肥点，研究那里的农业社把农业生产同卫生工作结合起来的经验。
    西八里庄的“泥封堆肥”，是把有机垃圾（如烂棉花、破布、鱼肉骨头、菜叶等）堆到一尺多高的时候，就在上面浇一层粪便，接着再堆一层垃圾，再浇一层粪便；堆的时候一面掺入少许马粪，一面插好通风管，直到堆成九丈长、一丈二尺宽、一人多高的垛子。然后再在四周挖一圈小沟，浇水合泥，就地用泥把肥堆封好。据说夏天经过两个月，冬天经过三个月，就可以使用了。
    这样的泥封堆肥还有着一定的科学道理。除了由于泥封防止粪便中的氮素散发，保存了肥力以外，由于肥堆里的温度、湿度适中，空气充足，肥堆中的马粪里含有的一种元平菌，大量繁殖起来。由于元平菌繁殖所形成的高温（一般可以达到摄氏七十度），可以杀死肥堆里的蝇蛹、虫子和其它细菌。肥堆里的有机物也因元平菌的繁殖等原因而分解成为细粒。在泥土封闭的情况下，这样的高温可以保持一个星期，所以泥封堆肥既讲卫生又能增产。
    八里庄积肥站是今年8月建立的。现在已经有十一个农业社参加了这个积肥站。由于经过泥封处理的肥料的肥力大，成本低，几个月来，社员们堆积了两千多万斤肥料。积肥站像火车站的货栈一样，从东到西，一个个肥堆整整齐齐地排列着。肥堆周围也非常整洁。人们在肥堆中间走来走去，既嗅不到腐臭味，也碰不到苍蝇，同过去不用泥土封闭的肥料迥然不同。
    石景山区田村乡的小型泥封堆肥点的操作方法同西八里庄大型土封堆肥相同，只不过肥堆较小，只有三尺见方。用的是自己家里的有机垃圾、猪粪和猪圈土。
    现在北京市东郊、丰台、南苑等郊区，一共有九个点正在作大型泥封堆肥试验。占全城垃圾半数的有机垃圾都被用来积肥；无机垃圾如煤渣等也全部用来填死水坑。目前，北京市所实行的有机垃圾和无机垃圾分类处理，间日集中清除的办法，为大力推广泥封堆肥经验，结合农业生产改善城乡环境卫生创造了极为有利的条件。（甸义）
