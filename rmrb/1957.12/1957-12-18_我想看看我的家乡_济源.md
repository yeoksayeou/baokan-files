　　I Want to See My Hometown - Jiyuan
    I was born in a foreign land, and to this day, I have never seen my hometown. Others often miss their hometowns, but I only think of it when filling out forms, casually writing "Jiyuan, Henan" and considering it done.
    When I was little, I often heard my parents talk about the situation in their hometown, things like people starving to death in famine years, people drowning in floods, and droughts and locust plagues. So, in my mind, my hometown was a picture of misery and horror.
    One evening, I saw an article in the People's Daily entitled "Let the Mountains and Rivers Benefit the People," with the subtitle "How Jiyuan County Achieved Victory in Farmland Water Conservancy Construction." I felt like I had discovered something precious and quickly read on. This article told me: The appearance of Jiyuan County today, ah! My hometown is so beautiful and lovely. But, in the old days, for many years, the mountains and rivers here not only did not benefit the people but brought disasters to the people. What about now? Under the leadership of the Party, they have found the magic weapon to control the mountains and rivers, allowing the mountains and rivers to benefit the people, with bumper harvests for four consecutive years...
    I finished reading it in one breath, and a beautiful picture flashed in my mind: in the foreground are fertile water fields, in the distance are layers of terraced fields, and rivers are busily irrigating the farmland...
    How much I want to see my hometown now!

### 我想看看我的家乡——济源

　　我想看看我的家乡——济源
    我是一个出生在异乡的人，至今，和我的故乡还未曾见过一面。别人常常想念故乡，可是我只是在填履历表时想到它，随手写出“河南济源”也就算完事。
    小时候，我常常听父母谈起故乡的情形，什么荒年饿死人啦，洪水淹死人啦，还有旱灾蝗灾等等。于是在我的脑海中，故乡就是一幅凄惨可怕的图景。
    一天傍晚，我看到人民日报上一篇题为“让山和水为人民造福”的文章，副题是“济源县怎样取得了农田水利建设的胜利”，我真像发现了什么珍贵的东西一样，赶紧读下去，这篇文章告诉我：济源县今天的面貌，啊！我的故乡原是这样的美丽可爱。可是，在旧时代，多少年来，这里的山和水不但没有给人民造福，反而给人民带来了灾难。现在怎样呢？他们在党的领导下找到了治山治水的法宝，让山和水为人民造福，连续四年丰收……
    我一口气读完了它，脑里便闪出一幅美丽的图景：近处是肥沃的水地，远处是层层的梯田，河流在奔忙着灌溉着农田……。
    我这时多么想看看我的故乡呀！
