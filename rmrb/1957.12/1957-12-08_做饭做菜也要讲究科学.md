Cooking Should Also Be Scientific
　　Zhou ?
People often ask, "What food is the most nutritious?" "What is the best way to eat it?" We say that to achieve good nutrition, on the one hand, it is necessary to correctly select foods and match them into a diet containing various nutrients; on the other hand, it is necessary to use reasonable cooking methods to ensure that the nutrients in the food are not lost. Here, we will mainly discuss how to preserve the nutrients in food when cooking.

Let's talk about grains first. Grains contain a lot of starch, so they are an important food for providing energy; they also provide some vitamins and minerals, especially Vitamin B1 and minerals such as iron and phosphorus. This vitamin can promote appetite, help digestion, and increase our energy and physical strength. Lack of it will make you feel poor appetite, listless, and in severe cases, beriberi will occur. Most of the vitamins and minerals contained in grains are distributed on the outer layer of rice, wheat, corn, and sorghum grains; in addition, Vitamin B is easily soluble in water; at the same time, it is also afraid of alkali and easily destroyed by alkali. Therefore, we need to pay attention to several issues when cooking. First, let's talk about washing rice. Some people soak the rice in water and rub it back and forth. In this way, most of the Vitamin B and minerals are washed away. The best way is to pick out the mud, sand, and weeds in the rice first, and then gently wash it once with water. Commonly used cooking methods include steaming rice, braising rice, straining rice, and cooking porridge. Among them, straining rice loses the most nutrients. Because most of the rice soup left over from straining rice is poured away, the Vitamin B and minerals dissolved in the rice soup are also poured away with the rice soup. The best way to cook rice is to steam or braise it with the original soup. When eating soup noodles, it is best to cook the noodles directly in the vegetable soup, so as to avoid loss of nutrients. Some people like to add some alkali when cooking porridge, but Vitamin B is destroyed by alkali, so it is best not to add alkali when cooking porridge.

How to preserve the nutrients in vegetables?

Vegetables are the richest source of minerals and vitamins for us. The minerals contained in vegetables include calcium, phosphorus, iron, copper, potassium, etc., which not only help us build body tissues, but also help us regulate physiological functions and improve health. The vitamins contained in vegetables include Vitamin A, Vitamin B, Vitamin C, etc. These vitamins are closely related to our health. Vitamin A can promote growth and strengthen our body's resistance to some diseases. Lack of Vitamin A can cause night blindness in adults, as well as a keratosis pilaris skin disease, and it is easy to contract respiratory infections. Green leafy vegetables and yellow vegetables contain more Vitamin A. Various vegetables also contain Vitamin B1, Vitamin B2 and Vitamin C. Vitamin B2, also known as riboflavin, is a vitamin necessary for maintaining health and promoting growth and development. Lack of it can cause angular cheilitis, cheilitis, glossitis, and some eye problems. Vitamin C can increase the body's resistance to infectious diseases and maintain the health of teeth. Lack of it can cause scurvy, so it is also called ascorbic acid. Vitamin C is easily soluble in water and is the most unstable vitamin; at the same time, it is also afraid of heat, alkali, and copper utensils. In view of some characteristics of the minerals and vitamins contained in vegetables, in order to preserve these nutrients when cooking, pay attention to the following points:

First, after buying fresh vegetables, store them in a room with a relatively low temperature. If they are placed in the sunlight for a long time, it is easy to cause Vitamin A and Vitamin C to be lost due to oxidation, and riboflavin will also be damaged by light. Therefore, vegetables should not be stored for too long, and it is best to eat them fresh.

Second, it is best to cut the vegetables that need to be cut just before cooking. Because the earlier the vegetables are cut, the more oxidation occurs, and the greater the loss of vitamins. When washing vegetables, wash them whole, wash them and then cut them, and do not soak them in water after cutting.

Third, the cooking time should not be too long. Because Vitamin C will be lost when exposed to heat, the longer the heating time, the greater the loss. The "high heat stir-frying" method used in Chinese cooking is good. When stir-frying vegetables, in order to reduce the chance of oxidation, after the vegetables are put into the wok, quickly cover the pot and cook them quickly. Since many vitamins and minerals are dissolved in the vegetable soup, be sure to drink the vegetable soup together with the vegetables.

Cooking methods are closely related to our health. Therefore, good cooking should not only taste good, but also pay attention to preserving the nutrients in the food.

    做饭做菜也要讲究科学
　　周?
    常常有人问：“什么食物是最富于营养的？”“怎样吃法最合适？”我们说，要达到良好的营养，一方面是正确的选择食物，配成一个含有各种营养成分的膳食；另一方面是使用合理的烹调方法，保证食物中的养分不受损失。这里，主要来谈谈做饭时怎样保存食物中的养分。
    先谈粮食。粮食含有很多的淀粉，所以是供给热量的一项重要的食物；同时也供给一些维生素和无机盐，比较多的是一号乙种维生素和铁、磷等无机盐。这种维生素能够促进食欲，帮助消化，增加我们的精神和体力。缺少它就会觉得胃口不好，精神不振，严重的时候，就要发生脚气病。粮食所含的维生素和无机盐大部分是分布在米粒、麦粒、玉米粒、高粱米外面一层的薄皮上；另外，乙种维生素很容易溶化在水里；同时，它也怕碱，容易被碱所破坏。因此我们在做饭的时候，就需要注意几个问题。先说淘米，有些人把米泡在水里，来回的搓洗。这样，乙种维生素和无机盐大部分就被搓洗掉了。最好的办法是把米里的泥砂、稗子等先挑选干净，然后用水轻轻地洗一次就行了。做饭的方法常用的有蒸饭、焖饭、捞饭和煮粥等等。其中损失养料最多的是捞饭。因为捞饭所剩下来的米汤大部分都倒掉不用，这就把溶在米汤里的乙种维生素和无机盐都跟米汤一块儿倒掉了。最好的做饭方法是用原汤蒸饭或者焖饭。在吃汤面的时候，最好是把面条直接煮在菜汤里，就免得损失养分。有些人煮粥的时候，喜欢加一些碱，但是乙种维生素却被碱破坏了，所以煮粥的时候最好不要加碱。
    怎样保存蔬菜里的养分呢？
    蔬菜是供给我们无机盐和维生素最丰富的来源。蔬菜所含的无机盐有钙、磷、铁、铜、钾等，它们不但能替我们构造身体组织，而且能帮助我们调节生理机能和增进健康。蔬菜所含的维生素有甲、乙、丙等数种。这些维生素都和我们的健康有密切的关系。甲种维生素能够促进生长，加强我们身体对一些疾病的抵抗力。缺少了甲种维生素，成人要得夜盲症，另外还可能得一种毛囊硬化的皮肤病，而且容易感染上呼吸道的传染病。蔬菜里含甲种维生素比较多的是绿叶菜和黄颜色的蔬菜。各种蔬菜里还含有一号乙种维生素、二号乙种维生素和丙种维生素。二号乙种维生素也叫做核黄素，它是保持健康，促进生长发育所必需的一种维生素，缺少了它，就要得口角炎、唇炎、舌炎和眼睛的一些毛病。丙种维生素能够增加身体对传染病的抵抗力，维持牙齿的健康，缺少了它，就要得坏血病，因此它也叫做抗坏血酸。丙种维生素很容易溶化在水里，是一种最不稳定的维生素；同时，它又怕热、怕碱、怕铜器。针对蔬菜里边所含的无机盐和维生素的一些特性，在做菜的时候，为了保存这些养分，要注意下面几点：
    第一，买来了新鲜蔬菜以后，要保存在温度比较低的屋子里，如果长时间地放在日光下，很容易使甲、丙二种维生素都因为氧化而损失，核黄素也会受到光的破坏。所以蔬菜不要放得太久，最好是吃新鲜的。
    第二，需要切的蔬菜最好到临下锅的时候再切。因为菜切得越早，氧化越多，维生素的损失也越大。洗菜的时候，要整洗，洗完了再切，切后不要泡在水里。
    第三，烹调的时间不能太长。因为丙种维生素遇到热就要受到损失，加热的时间越久，损失越大。我国烹调蔬菜的时候所用的“大火急炒”的方法是好的。在炒菜的时候，为了减少氧化的机会，菜放到炒勺以后，要赶快盖上锅盖，在短时间内炒熟。由于有许多维生素的无机盐溶化在菜汤里，所以吃菜一定要连菜汤一齐喝进去。
    做饭做菜的方法和我们的健康有着密切的关系。所以饭菜做得好，除了要味道好，还应该注意保存食物中的养分。
