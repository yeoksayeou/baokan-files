Two Cough and Phlegm Medicines

Coughing is a common symptom of respiratory organs, and it is especially common in the cold winter.

Winter coughs are often caused by acute respiratory infectious diseases, such as colds, flu, acute bronchitis, etc., all of which have cough symptoms. Some chronic respiratory diseases, such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, etc., also often have coughs.

Coughing is originally a protective physiological reaction. Most coughs are caused by phlegm in the trachea, which stimulates the nerves on the tracheal mucosa. Coughing can discharge the phlegm and prevent it from staying in the trachea. Therefore, although coughing is a morbid state, it is beneficial to the human body. For general coughs, as long as the patient does not have any pain, there is no need for special treatment.

However, if the cough is very severe, even hindering appetite, causing vomiting, affecting sleep; or the phlegm is stubborn and difficult to cough up, and the patient is in great pain, then it must be treated.

China National Pharmaceutical Corporation now manufactures and sells two kinds of over-the-counter cough and phlegm medicines, both prepared according to the prescriptions stipulated by the Ministry of Health. One is Zhike Qutan Pian (cough and phlegm tablets) for adults; the other is Xiaor Zhike Tangjiang (pediatric cough syrup).

Zhike Qutan Pian contains seven raw materials: Yuanzhi (thinleaf milkwort root), Jiegeng (platycodon root), Beimu (fritillaria bulb), Gancao (licorice root), ammonium chloride, ammonium leaf oil and star anise oil. The main raw materials of Xiaor Zhike Tangjiang are ammonium chloride, Jiegeng, Gancao, sodium benzoate, orange peel tincture and sucrose. These two medicines are very effective for coughs caused by colds. (Xue)

　  两种止咳祛痰药
    咳嗽，是呼吸器官常见的症状，到了寒冷的冬天尤其多见。
    冬季常见的咳嗽，有些是由急性呼吸系传染病引起的，如伤风、感冒、急性支气管炎等，都有咳嗽的症状。还有些慢性呼吸系疾病，如慢性支气管炎，肺气肿等，也都常有咳嗽。
    咳嗽，本来是一种保护性的生理反应。多数咳嗽是由于气管里有痰，刺激了气管粘膜上的神经才引起来的，通过咳嗽就可以把痰排泄出来，不让它在气管里停留。所以，虽说咳嗽是一种病态，但对于人体却是有利的。对于一般咳嗽，只要病人没有什么痛苦，并不需要加以特别处理。
    倘使咳嗽得很厉害，甚至妨碍食欲、引起呕吐、影响睡眠；或者痰很顽固不易咳出来，病人很痛苦，那就非加以处理不可。
    中国医药公司现在制有两种止咳祛痰的成药出售，都是根据卫生部规定的方子配制的。一种是供成年人用的止咳祛痰片；另一种是小儿止咳糖浆。
    止咳祛痰片里含有远志、桔梗、贝母、甘草、氯化铵、铵叶油和八角茴香油等七种原料。小儿止咳糖浆的主要原料，是氯化铵、桔梗、甘草、苯甲酸钠、橙皮酊和蔗糖。这两种药对伤风感冒引起的咳嗽很有效。　（学）
