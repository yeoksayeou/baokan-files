    Good Example of Contacting the Masses
    By a People's Daily Commentator
    We are very pleased to recommend to everyone the news about the Communist Party members of the Tianjin Dongya Wool and Linen Textile Factory strengthening their contact with the masses.
    The news from the Dongya Wool and Linen Textile Factory is so pleasing because the Party members of this factory are ahead of other factories and mines, and they have worked together to effectively defeat a bad ideology—sectarianism—while also greatly reducing the market for the activities of two other bad ideologies—bureaucratism and subjectivism.
    Maintaining the closest ties with the broadest masses of the people has always been a prominent feature of our Party and an important guarantee for the smooth progress of our revolution and construction. The current sectarian and bureaucratic tendencies of some Party members hinder the implementation of the Party's principle of close ties with the masses, causing some losses in our work. This problem is even more prominent among new Party members, because many of them lack sufficient understanding of the Party's tradition of the mass line. Among the nearly three hundred Party members developed by the Dongya Wool and Linen Textile Factory since liberation, some have become estranged from the masses after joining the Party, especially after taking on certain leadership positions. There are some objective reasons for this phenomenon, such as their frequent participation in meetings, social activities, and busier work schedules. At the same time, the masses have higher demands on them, and their contact with them is not as casual as it used to be, and so on. But the more important reason is that these comrades do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of maintaining close ties with the masses and relying on the masses, they have not established a good mass viewpoint, and have not learned the working methods of the mass line. Some people are satisfied with simply using "routine" methods to carry out their work; some are even blindly arrogant and complacent, looking down on non-Party members. All this has led to the adverse consequences of being divorced from the masses. The masses are fully justified in criticizing this phenomenon.
    The Party Central Committee has taught us more than once that Party members must earnestly learn from the people. Because the knowledge and experience of the masses are extremely rich, and the creative ability of the masses is inexhaustible. We must first learn from the masses, and then we can lead the masses, and in order to constantly learn from the masses, we must not be separated from the masses for a moment. If we isolate ourselves from the masses, we will become deaf and blind, and of course, we cannot even talk about leading the masses. Some people think they are great after joining the Party, thinking that they "can't talk to" non-Party members, and are unwilling to approach the masses, which is obviously very wrong. Even for some of the more backward people, we should not despise them or look down on them, but should be close to them, unite them, persuade them, and encourage them to move forward. Those comrades who think they are superior to the masses can also think about their own situation. Were you born qualified to be a Party member? Didn't you make progress only with the education and help of the Party?
    The Party Central Committee has taught us more than once that the realization of all the Party's propositions must be achieved through the conscious efforts of the people under the leadership of the Party. How can we enlighten the consciousness of the masses? The prerequisite is to maintain close ties with the masses and become one with them. If you don't talk to the masses for half a year and ignore them when you see them, how can you enlighten the masses? After the victory of the national revolution, the Party's prestige among the people of the whole country has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and the masses can strive to realize the propositions put forward by the Party. Some comrades mistakenly believe that now they can carry out their work by administrative means alone, and there is no need to maintain close ties with the masses and deeply mobilize the masses. However, looking at the actual situation, let's talk about the situation of factories and mines. Aren't all the rationalization proposals, new records, and inventions the result of fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses? Today, it may be possible to barely carry out work by administrative means alone; but if you want to complete the task well and get full marks, you still cannot do without maintaining close ties with the masses and deeply mobilizing the masses.
    These thoughts and views, such as thinking that work can be carried out simply by administrative means, being arrogant and complacent, and looking down on non-Party members, are all unfounded and are obstacles to fulfilling the obligation of Party members to maintain close ties with the masses. Resolutely eliminate these ideas and truly establish a mass viewpoint, in order to thoroughly overcome sectarian tendencies in the rectification campaign.
    Another pleasing aspect of the news from the Dongya Wool and Linen Textile Factory is that the Party members of this factory have found a good way to strengthen their contact with the masses. Their approach is to actively restore the original close relationship with the masses and widely make friends with non-Party members. Starting with "restoring relations" is a very convenient way to strengthen ties with the masses; widely making friends with the masses should be vigorously promoted among all Party members. If every Party member makes more close friends and persists in this for a long time, the flesh-and-blood ties between our Party and the masses will be closer. This will enable the Party to understand the thoughts and demands of the masses in a timely manner, and to thoroughly implement the Party's propositions among the masses in a timely manner. Our socialist construction will proceed more smoothly. Of course, making friends takes time and encounters some difficulties, but this is a matter of great political significance, which should be done and can be fully done by the communists.
    Recently, the Party Central Committee has put forward a great task to the people of the country: to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science in the next ten to fifteen years. Although our Party now has more than ten million members, it still accounts for only a small minority of the country's population. Relying solely on the strength of Party members cannot accomplish this glorious and important task. If the Party organizations in various units can, like the Party members of the Dongya Wool and Linen Textile Factory, earnestly strengthen their ties with non-Party members in the rectification movement, and unremittingly unite the people of the whole country around the Party in the future, then we will be able to smoothly build a magnificent socialist mansion in our country according to the goals guided by the Central Committee!

    联系群众的好榜样
    本报评论员
    我们怀着十分高兴的心情，向大家推荐天津东亚毛麻纺织厂党员同志们加强同群众联系的消息。
    东亚毛麻纺织厂的消息所以令人高兴，是因为这个厂的党员同志走在一般厂矿企业的前面，大家一齐动手有效地打倒了一个坏主义——宗派主义，同时也大大缩小了另外两个坏主义——官僚主义和主观主义的活动市场。
    同最广大的人民群众取得最密切的联系，一直是我们党的一个显著的标志，也是我国革命和建设事业顺利进展的重要保证。目前部分党员中的宗派主义、官僚主义倾向，妨碍了党的紧密联系群众这一原则的贯彻，造成了工作中的一些损失。在新党员中，由于不少人对党的群众路线的传统缺乏足够的认识，这一问题就显得更为突出。东亚毛麻纺织厂在解放后发展的近三百个党员中，有一部分人在入党以后，特别是担负了某些领导工作以后，便同群众疏远了。造成这种现象有一些客观原因，例如他们参加会议多，社会活动多，工作比较忙，同时群众对他们的要求比过去高了，同他们接触也不像过去那样随便了，等等。但是更重要的原因，却是这些同志对于密切联系群众和依靠群众的重要意义认识不足，没有很好地树立起群众观点，没有学会群众路线的工作方法。有的人满足于单纯用“例行公事”的方式去进行工作；有的人甚至盲目骄傲自满，看不起非党群众。这都造成了脱离群众的不良后果。群众批评这种现象是完全应当的。
    党中央不止一次地教导我们：党员要认真地向人民群众学习。因为群众的知识、经验是极丰富的，群众的创造能力是无穷无尽的。我们必须首先向群众学习，然后才能领导群众而为了不断地向群众学习，我们就一刻也不能脱离群众。如果我们从群众中孤立起来，我们就会耳聋目瞆，当然更谈不到去领导群众了。有人在入党以后就自以为了不起，认为同非党群众“说不到一块儿”，不愿意去接近群众，显然是十分错误的。即使是对某些比较落后的人，也不应该轻视他们，看不起他们，而是应该亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。那些自以为比群众高明的同志，还可以根据自己的情况想一想，难道你天生的就合乎党员条件？你不也是在党的教育帮助下才有了进步的吗？
    党中央不止一次地教导我们：我们党的一切主张的实现，都要通过人民群众在党的领导下的自觉的努力。怎样才能去启发群众的自觉？先决条件就是紧密联系群众，同群众打成一片。半年不同群众谈一谈心，见了群众怠答不理，哪里还能去启发群众呢？全国革命胜利以后，党在全国人民中的威信空前提高，党所提出的主张，群众都能努力去实现。有的同志就误认为，现在只靠行政方式便可以进行工作，不需要再密切联系群众、深入发动群众了。可是，看看实际情况，就说厂矿企业的情况吧，凡是有大量合理化建议、新纪录、创造发明出现的，不都是充分发动了群众的积极性的结果吗？在今天，单靠行政方式也许能勉强进行工作；但是要想把任务完成得很好，要想使工作得满分，离开紧密联系群众、深入发动群众还是不成的。
    这些以为单纯靠行政方式就可以进行工作，骄傲自满、看不起非党群众等思想、观点，都是毫无根据的，都是履行党员密切联系群众这一义务的障碍。坚决破除这些思想，切实树立群众观点，才能在整风中彻底克服宗派主义倾向。
    东亚毛麻纺织厂消息中另一个令人高兴之处，是这个厂的党员同志们找到了加强同群众联系的好办法。他们的作法是：积极恢复同群众原有的密切关系，广泛地同非党群众交朋友。从“恢复关系”入手，是一个加强同群众联系的很方便的办法；广泛地同群众交朋友，更应该在全体党员中大力提倡。每个党员都多交一些知心朋友，并且长期坚持下来，我们党同群众的血肉般的联系就将更加密切了。这样既可以使党及时了解群众的思想、要求，又可以及时深入地把党的主张贯彻到群众中去。我们的社会主义建设就将会进行得更加顺利。当然，交朋友要花一些时间，会碰到一些困难，然而这是一件具有重大政治意义的事情，对于共产党员们来说，是应该做、也完全能够做到的。
    最近，党中央向全国人民提出了一个伟大的任务：在今后十年到十五年内，把我国建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。现在我们党虽然已经有了一千多万党员，但是在全国人口中仍然只占极少数。仅仅依靠党员的力量是不能完成这一光荣而重大的任务的。如果各个单位的党组织都能像东亚毛麻纺织厂的党员同志们那样，在整风运动中认真加强同非党群众的联系，并且在今后坚持不懈地把全国人民团结在党的周围，那末，我们就将会顺利地按照中央指引的目标，在我国建立起宏伟的社会主义大厦！
