Xinhua News Agency, 1st - Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in the Beijing area have diligently implemented the spirit of "enlightening family members to voluntarily return to their hometowns for production based on mature ideological education." Currently, the number of officers' family members who have left the troops and returned to their hometowns accounts for nearly one-third of the total number of family members accompanying the troops.

The Party committees and leading organs at all levels of the Beijing troops have fully utilized mass self-education methods such as extensive airing of views, big debates, etc., in mobilizing family members to return to their hometowns for production. After the leaders' mobilization, many units quickly launched a mass upsurge of airing views and debates. In the extensive airing of views and big debates, many units used the method of meticulous accounting to fully explain the benefits of officers' family members returning to their hometowns for production to national construction, army construction, and the officers and their families themselves. This enabled officers and their families to recognize the great significance of this measure, so that family members truly voluntarily, happily, and enthusiastically signed up to return to their hometowns for production.

Many units of the Beijing Garrison also attach great importance to helping returning officers' family members solve many difficulties and problems that should and can be solved. For officers' family members who have difficulties with travel expenses and settling down for production, officers are generally approved to borrow salary in advance or are given appropriate subsidies. For family members who are weak, have many children, and have inconvenient travel back to their hometowns, the leadership generally sends special personnel to escort them, or allows officers to take leave to accompany them.

In order to continue to achieve greater success with this measure of mobilizing family members accompanying the troops to return to their hometowns for production, the leading organs of the Beijing troops have recently issued instructions requesting all troops to continue to vigorously carry out ideological and organizational work, and mobilize officers' family members who should and can return to their hometowns for production to return as soon as possible. In units where family members have already partially or largely returned, they should, through appropriate means, understand the resettlement and production of the returned family members.

### 解放军驻北京部队　近三分之一军官家属离队还乡

    解放军驻北京部队
　　近三分之一军官家属离队还乡
    新华社1日讯　中国人民解放军驻北京地区部队由于认真贯彻“在思想教育成熟的基础上启发家属自愿返乡生产”的精神，目前离队还乡的军官家属，将近占随军家属总人数的三分之一。
    北京部队各级党委和领导机关在动员家属返乡生产工作中，充分运用了大鸣大放大辩论等群众自我教育的形式。许多部队在首长动员之后，迅速掀起了一个群众性的鸣放和辩论热潮。在大鸣大放和大辩论中，许多单位用算细账的办法，充分说明军官家属还乡生产对国家建设、军队建设以及军官和家属本人的好处，从而使军官和家属认识了这一措施的重大意义，使家属们真正自愿地愉快地踊跃报名回乡生产。
    北京驻军许多单位还十分重视帮助还乡军官家属解决许多应当解决而又可能解决的困难和问题。对回家路费和安家生产有困难的军官家属，一般都批准军官预借薪金或予以适当的补助。对身体弱、子女多回乡旅途不便的家属，领导上一般都派专人护送，或准许军官请假伴送。
    为了使动员随军家属还乡生产这一措施继续取得更大的成绩，北京部队领导机关还在最近发出指示，要求各部队除继续大力作好思想工作和组织工作，动员应该和可以返乡生产的军官家属尽快返乡外，在家属已经部分或大部返乡的单位，应通过适当方式，了解返乡家属的安置和生产情况等。
