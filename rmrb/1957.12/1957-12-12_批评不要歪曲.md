　　Criticism Should Not Distort
  　Cai Yi
    Mr. Li Zehou's article "The Objectivity and Social Nature of Beauty," as indicated by the subtitle, is a critique of Zhu Guangqian's and my aesthetic views. After carefully reading his criticism of me, I cannot help but want to say a few words. What I want to say now only concerns the facts related to his criticism of me, and I will not touch upon his arguments for the time being.

    His criticism of my aesthetic views mainly focuses on two points: First, he says that I believe beauty is the mathematical, mechanical, physical, and biological natural attributes of objects themselves; second, he says that I believe the standard or law of beauty is "the golden ratio," "balance and symmetry," and "the balanced unity of form," etc. He said: What Cai Yi believes in is precisely this metaphysical materialist aesthetic view: "To go to natural things themselves to find the standard of beauty, and to find 'the golden ratio,' 'the balanced unity of form,' etc."; "To reduce beauty to such simple and low-level mechanical, physical, and biological natural conditions or attributes, believing that this natural attribute and condition of objective objects itself is beauty." And he said: "To abstract certain natural attributes of objects such as volume, form, and growth from various concrete objects, to rigidify them, and to say that this is the law of beauty. In fact, this is to regard beauty and the law of beauty as an immutable, absolute natural measure of abstract objective existence..."
  [Note 1]

    Li Zehou originally stated that he was criticizing based on "New Aesthetics" and quoted the basic arguments about beauty from "New Aesthetics," so his criticism should be based on the original appearance of "New Aesthetics" and its basic arguments, right? However, in fact, what he calls "Cai Yi's Aesthetic View" and "New Aesthetics" are completely inconsistent.

    The basic arguments about beauty in "New Aesthetics," as quoted by Li Zehou, "The essence of beauty is the typicality of things, that is, the general of the species is manifested in the individual," "Beautiful things are typical things, that is, the manifester of the universality and necessity of the species." These two sentences are already quite clear. The essence of beauty is typicality, and typicality is the individual's significant expression of generality. This speaks of a unified relationship between the individuality and generality of things, certainly not a certain or certain natural attributes of objects themselves, such as the so-called mathematical, mechanical, physical, and biological natural attributes themselves, let alone the so-called "to abstract certain natural attributes of objects such as volume, form, and growth from various concrete objects, to rigidify them."

    "New Aesthetics" believes that beauty can be divided into natural beauty, social beauty, and artistic beauty, and has dedicated chapters and sections to discuss it. It was clearly stated that the main determining condition of social beauty is "the relationship between people in the production process, which is referred to as the relations of production"; in class society, "class relations permeate other social relations and become the main determining condition of social things, and thus become the main determining condition of social beauty." [Note 2] Artistic beauty, on the one hand, "is determined by the depth of the typicality of the objective object, and on the other hand, by the intensity of the subject's typification of the object. That is, artistic beauty is determined by the author's understanding and expression" - "Artistic beauty is defined by the generality of the class." [Note 3] What is said here is not that beauty is "the mathematical, mechanical, physical, and biological natural attributes of objects themselves." This does not need to be said, right? As for natural beauty, "New Aesthetics" certainly believes that natural beauty lies in natural attributes, and the main determining condition is its species generality; that is to say, the beauty of natural things lies in its individuality fully and significantly expressing the generality of the species. This speaks of a unified relationship between its various attributes and conditions, not that beauty is a certain or certain natural attribute itself, such as the so-called mathematical, mechanical, physical, and biological natural attributes themselves, which is also very obvious.

    Does "New Aesthetics" believe that "the golden ratio," "balance and symmetry," or the so-called "balanced unity of form" are the standard or law of beauty? In "New Aesthetics," the golden ratio, balance, and symmetry are mainly mentioned in two places, both clearly denying the old saying that they are the principles or "elements" of beauty. For example, regarding balance and symmetry, "New Aesthetics" once said that they "have considerable determinacy for the beauty of the form of individual things. However, they have almost no determinacy for the beauty of the entire individual thing. That is, as far as the beauty of individual things is concerned, balance and symmetry are not 'elements' of beauty." [Note 4] For example, regarding the golden ratio, "New Aesthetics" says: "The line segment of the golden ratio is beautiful. Why is it beautiful? Because it contains proportion"; "For beautiful things, in terms of form alone, proportion has considerable determinacy," "However, proportion is a condition of the form of beauty," "But it is not that beautiful things are beautiful because they contain proportion." [Note 5] The most significant fact is that the table of contents and section titles of "New Aesthetics" have two items: "Balance and Symmetry are not Characteristics of Beauty" and "Proportion and Harmony are not Characteristics of Beauty." Anyone with a slightly scientific attitude would not completely obliterate it and say that "New Aesthetics" believes that "balance and symmetry" and "the golden ratio" are the standard or law of beauty of things, right? As for the term "balanced unity of form," I only saw it for the first time in Li Zehou's article. Saying that something that even I don't know is the standard or law of beauty, I don't think I would be "absurd" to that extent.

    "New Aesthetics" once gave examples of reclining ancient pines and slanting weak willows in paintings, explaining that this "can express their flourishing and indomitable vitality." It then continued, "Therefore, the universal balance and symmetry of form can be ignored." If it is not to cut off words and sentences and take things out of context, it can be understood that what is said here is not that balance and symmetry are the standard or law of beauty for pines or willows. On the contrary, it is said that they are not the standard or law of beauty for things; and to say that their inclusion in paintings is the full expression of universality with unique individuality - the flourishing vitality of branches and leaves, is also not to say that simple abstract vitality is the standard or law of beauty.

    In short, what Li Zehou calls "Cai Yi's Aesthetic View," "to abstract certain natural attributes of objects such as volume, form, and growth from various concrete objects, to rigidify them, and to say that this is the law of beauty," or to say that this is beauty, this aesthetic view cannot be found in the main arguments of "New Aesthetics" and cannot be deduced from the basic arguments of "New Aesthetics." Then it is not originally present in "New Aesthetics," but rather imposed on "New Aesthetics" by Li Zehou. Perhaps it is due to a careless misunderstanding rather than an intentional fabrication. In fact, this is a fundamental distortion of the arguments of "New Aesthetics."

    Finally, he also mentioned Chernyshevsky's criticism of Hegel, believing that it "is also quite applicable to Cai Yi." Hegel believes that beauty is the manifestation of ideas in finite forms, essentially believing that beauty originates from ideas outside of reality; while "New Aesthetics" believes that the essence of beauty is the individuality of things manifesting generality, which means that beauty lies in objective reality. The fundamental arguments of the two are completely different, which can be seen clearly. Admittedly, the theory that beauty is typical may be derived from Hegel's arguments (which is also said in "New Aesthetics"). This was not explicitly stated in Hegel's "Aesthetics," but it was proposed in Fischer's "Aesthetics." However, whether it is Hegel or Fischer, because they believe that beauty originates from ideas, they do not recognize real beauty as true beauty. On the contrary, they believe that natural beauty (real beauty) is not true beauty, and only artistic beauty is true beauty (Chernyshevsky's relevant essays also discussed this point). "New Aesthetics" believes that real beauty is also true beauty, which also shows that the two are completely different.

    As for Chernyshevsky's criticism of the saying that beauty is typical, if someone has carefully read "New Aesthetics," it is not difficult to see that there is an appropriate explanation for the issues he discussed. Although the publication of "New Aesthetics" was long before his aesthetic theories were circulated in China, the explanation of "New Aesthetics" was not originally directed at his criticism and may have lacked clarity. "New Aesthetics" says: "In reality, the species relationship of some things is very simple, and the unified relationship between its species attributes and individual attributes is also very simple. It (this unified relationship) even has almost no so-called species attributes being dominant and individual attributes being dominant (distinction), so there is no so-called (typical and atypical) distinction between beauty and ugliness" [Note 6]. That is to say, in real things, not all species have individual types. On the contrary, many things, especially things in nature, have species but no individual types. In "New Aesthetics," it is believed that generally low-level species of things in nature are not beautiful, while high-level species of things, species with typicality, are relatively beautiful. As for low-level species of things, there is no such thing as a certain individual being typical or beautiful. Therefore, as Li Zehou said, "In Cai Yi's view, the most 'typical' frog that most fully 'manifests' the universal and inevitable species attributes of the frog, where is it beautiful?" Here, Li Zehou once again shows disregard for the original arguments of "New Aesthetics" and instead caricatures it.

    "New Aesthetics" has shortcomings and errors, which I myself know, and I look forward to rigorous scientific criticism; but distortion is never criticism, and it does not do any good to academic exploration.

### 批评不要歪曲

专栏：

　　批评不要歪曲
  　蔡仪
    李泽厚先生的“美的客观性和社会性”一文，如副题所标明是批评朱光潜和我的美学观的。我在仔细看了他对我的批评之后，不禁有些话想说，现在要说的只是他对我的批评有关的事实，暂不涉及他的论点。
    他对我的美学观的批评主要是两点：第一，说我认为美是物体的数学的、机械的、物理的、生物的自然属性本身；第二，说我认为美的标准或美的法则就是“黄金分割”、“均衡和对称”及“形态的均衡统一”等等。他说：蔡仪所信奉的就正是这种形而上学唯物主义的美学观：“到自然事物本身中去寻找美的标准，找出了‘黄金分割’、‘形态的均衡统一’等等”；“把美归结为这种简单的低级的机械、物理、生物的自然条件或属性，认为客观物体的这种自然属性、条件本身就是美”。而且说：“把物体的某些自然属性如体积、形态、生长等等从各种具体的物体中抽象出来，僵化起来，说这就是美的法则。这实际上，就是把美和美的法则看作是一种一成不变的绝对的自然尺度的抽象的客观存在……”
  〔注一〕
    李泽厚原曾声明是根据“新美学”来批评的，并曾引了“新美学”中关于美的基本论点的话，那么他的批评应该是按照“新美学”的本来面目、按照它的基本论点来论证的吧。然而事实上他所谓“蔡仪的美学观”和“新美学”是完全不符合的。
    “新美学”的关于美的基本论点，如李泽厚所引，“美的本质就是事物的典型性，就是个别之中显现着种类的一般”，“美的事物就是典型的事物，就是种类的普遍性必然性的显现者”，这两句话本已说得颇清楚，美的本质是典型性，而典型性是事物的个别性显著地表现着一般性。这说的是事物的个别性和一般性的一种统一关系，决不是物体的某种或某些自然属性本身，如所谓数学的、机械的、物理的、生物的自然属性本身，更不是所谓“把物体的某些自然属性如体积、形态、生长等等从各种具体的物体中抽象出来，僵化起来”。
    “新美学”认为美有自然美，社会美和艺术美之分，并有专章专节论它。其中就曾明白地说，社会美的主要决定条件是“生产过程中人和人的关系，简称之是生产关系”；在阶级社会里，“阶级关系浸透于其他的社会关系，成为社会事物的主要的决定条件，也就成为社会美的主要的决定条件。”〔注二〕艺术美一方面“决定于客观对象典型性的深度，另一方面决定于主观对于对象的典型化的强度。也就是艺术美是决定于作者的认识和表现”——“艺术美规定于阶级的一般性”。〔注三〕这里说的并不是所谓美是“物体的数学的、机械的、物理的、生物的自然属性本身，”这是不用多说的吧。至于自然美，“新美学”固然认为自然美在于自然属性，而且主要的决定条件是它的种属的一般性；也就是说，自然事物的美是在于它的个别性充分地显著地表现着种属的一般性。这说的就是它的各种属性条件之间的一种统一关系，并不是说美就是它的某种或某些自然属性本身如所谓数学的、机械的、物理的、生物的自然属性本身，也是很显然的。
    “新美学”是不是认为“黄金分割”、“均衡和对称”或所谓“形态的均衡统一”是美的标准或美的法则呢？在“新美学”中主要有两个地方谈到黄金分割率、均衡和对称，都是明白地否定它们是美的原则或“原素”的旧的说法的，例如关于均衡和对称，“新美学”中曾说，它们“对于个体事物的形体的美虽有相当的规定性。而对于个体事物全体的美来说几乎没有什么规定性。也就是就个体事物的美来说，均衡和对称却不是什么美的‘原素’”。〔注四〕又如关于黄金分割率，“新美学”中说：“黄金分割的线段是美的，为什么是美的呢？因为包含有比例”；“对于美的事物，单以形式来说，比例则有相当的规定性”，“然而比例是美的形式的一个条件”，“却不是美的事物就是因为包含了比例”。〔注五〕最显著的事实是“新美学”的目录和小节标题就有“均衡和对称不是美的特性”、“比例和调和不是美的特性”两项，稍有科学态度的人，当不会全然抹煞它而说“新美学”认为“均衡和对称”及“黄金分割”是事物的美的标准或法则吧。至于所谓“形态的均衡统一”这样的术语，我还是第一次在李泽厚的文章中才看到，连自己也不知道的东西说是什么美的标准或美的法则，我想自己还不会“荒唐”到这样地步。
    “新美学”中曾举偃卧的古松和欹斜的弱柳入画的例子，说明这样“能表现着它们的枝叶向荣不屈不挠的欣欣生意”，其后还曾接着说，“因此形体上的普遍性的均衡和对称，是可以被忽视的”。如果不是割裂词句、断章取义，原可以明白，这里说的，并非均衡和对称是松或柳的美的标准或法则，正相反，是说它们不是事物的美的标准或法则；而说它们的入画是以独特的个别性充分地表现了普遍性——枝叶向荣的欣欣生意，也并非说单纯的抽象的生意就是什么美的标准或法则。
    总之，李泽厚所谓“蔡仪的美学观”、“把物体的某些自然属性如体积、形态、生长等等从各种具体的物体中抽象出来，僵化起来，说这就是美的法则”，或者说这就是美，这种美学观，在“新美学”的主要论证中找不到，从“新美学”的基本论点中也是推论不出来的，那么它不是“新美学”本来有的，而是李泽厚强加到“新美学”上去的。也许是由于大意的误解而不是有意的捏造，实际上这是对于“新美学”论点的根本歪曲。
    最后他还提到车尔尼雪夫斯基对黑格尔的批评，认为“也相当适用于蔡仪”。黑格尔认为美是观念在有限形式中的显现，实质上认为美是根源于现实之外的观念；而“新美学”认为美的本质是事物的个别性显现着一般性，则是认为美在于客观现实，两者的根本论据截然不同，是可以看得清楚的。诚然由黑格尔的论点可能引伸出美是典型的理论（“新美学”中也说过），这在黑格尔的“美学”中没有明确提出，到斐舍的“美学”中就是这样提出了。然而黑格尔也好，斐舍也好，由于他们认为美根源于观念，他们并不承认现实美是真正的美，相反的，认为自然美（现实美）不是真正的美，只有艺术美才是真正的美（车尔尼雪夫斯基的有关论文也曾论及这点），而“新美学”则认为现实美也是真正的美，这也表现着两者又是截然不同的。
    至于车尔尼雪夫斯基对美是典型之说的批评，如果认真看过“新美学”的人，不难见到，关于他所论及的问题，其中已有适当的说明。虽然“新美学”的出版是早在他的美学理论在中国流传之前，“新美学”的说明原来不是针对着他的批评的，可能有不够明确的地方。“新美学”说：“现实存在中有些事物的种类关系是非常简单的，它的种类的属性条件和个别的属性条件的统一关系也是非常简单的，它（这统一关系）甚至几乎无所谓种类的属性条件是优势的和个别的属性条件是优势的（之别），也就无所谓（典型的和非典型的）美的和丑的之分”〔注六〕。这就是说，在现实事物中并非一切种类中都有个别的典型，相反的，许多事物，尤其是自然界的事物，虽有种类而没有个别的典型。在“新美学”中认为一般自然界低级的种类事物是不美的，而高级的种类事物、有典型性的种类事物是比较美的。至于低级的种类事物之中更无所谓某一个别是典型的、是美的。因此如李泽厚所谓“在蔡仪那里，就是最充分地‘显现了’青蛙的普遍必然的种类属性的某个最‘典型的’青蛙，到底又美在哪里呢？”这里又表现李泽厚无视“新美学”原有的论点，却将它滑稽化。
    “新美学”中有缺点和错误，我自己也知道，并期待着严正的科学批评；可是歪曲决不是批评，对于学术的探讨并没有什么好处。
