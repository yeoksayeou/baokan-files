One of China's Famous Coal Mines
　　Zaozhuang Coal Mine Restores Youth
Xinhua News Agency, Zaozhuang, 30th—The Zaozhuang Coal Mine, one of China's famous coal mines, which suffered severe damage and ceased production during the Liberation War, today completed the restoration and reconstruction project of the East Great Well and officially went into production.

This morning, a grand handover ceremony was held. Representatives from the Jinan Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry, Shen Faduan, Director of Zaozhuang Mining Bureau, Cui Xi, Director of the Joint State-Private Zaozhuang Coal Mine, and Li Zufun, Deputy Director and agent of the private sector, all spoke at the meeting. Local leaders of the Communist Party Committee and the Zaozhuang Mining Area Party Committee and trade unions also attended to offer their congratulations. Worker representative Wang Shengchi, on behalf of all the workers of the mine, stated at the meeting that they would actively produce coal to support national construction.

After the Zaozhuang Coal Mine became a joint state-private enterprise in 1952, the state began preparations for restoration and reconstruction, and officially started drainage in January 1955; within two hundred and sixty days, 14.65 million tons of accumulated water was discharged from the well. Such a huge drainage project is rare in the history of coal mine restoration projects.

From the beginning of the restoration to the official handover of the East Great Well for production, 28.25 million yuan has been invested; it is estimated that the total investment will reach about 40 million yuan upon completion of the entire restoration and reconstruction project. According to the design capacity, it can produce 1.2 million tons of coal per year after the completion of the entire restoration and reconstruction project.

The degree of mechanization of coal mining and transportation in the rejuvenated Zaozhuang Coal Mine has been greatly improved compared to the past. In the past, coal transportation tools such as carrying baskets, pushing carts, and mule-drawn carts used underground have now been replaced by new electric locomotives and coal conveying machines; ground loading has also been fully mechanized.

The coal produced by Zaozhuang Mine has strong firepower, low ash content, and low sulfur and phosphorus content, making it a very good coking coal.

Zaozhuang Coal Mine used to be one of the three major coal mines in China; the other two major coal mines are Kailuan and Fushun. It was built in 1899. After Chiang Kai-shek launched the anti-people civil war in 1946, the mine suffered serious damage from the war and ceased production and was flooded.

　　建设花朵处处盛开
    我国著名煤矿之一
　　枣庄煤矿恢复青春
    新华社枣庄30日电　在解放战争中遭受严重破坏而停产的枣庄煤矿，今天完成了东大井的恢复改建工程，并且正式投入生产。
    今天上午，举行了隆重的移交生产典礼大会。煤炭部济南管理局的代表、枣庄矿务局局长申法端，公私合营枣庄煤矿矿长崔西，副矿长、资方代理人李祖芬，都在大会上讲了话。当地中共党委和枣庄矿区党委、工会的负责人，也到会祝贺。工人代表王升墀代表全矿的工人在会上表示，他们要积极生产煤炭，支援国家建设。
    枣庄煤矿在1952年公私合营以后，国家即着手进行恢复改建的准备工作，并且在1955年1月正式开始排水；在二百六十天以内，就排出井下积水一千四百六十五万吨。这样巨大的排水工程，在煤矿恢复工程史上是少有的。
    这个矿从开始恢复到东大井正式移交生产，已投资二千八百二十五万元；预计全部恢复改建完成，总投资将达四千万元左右。按照设计能力，全部恢复改建工程完成以后，它每年能产一百二十万吨煤。
    重回青春的枣庄煤矿，采煤和运输机械化程度都比以前大大提高。过去井下用的人抬筐、人推车和骡马拉车等运煤工具，现在已被新型的电机车和运煤机代替；地面装车也已全部机械化。
    枣庄矿出产的煤，火力强、灰分低，含硫和含磷量小，是很好的炼焦煤。
    枣庄煤矿过去是我国三大煤矿之一；另外两大煤矿是开滦和抚顺。它建矿于1899年。在1946年蒋介石发动反人民的内战以后，这个矿即遭受战火的严重破坏，遂停止生产被水淹没。
