          (Reflections on seeing a big-character poster)
    Almost everyone here has contributed a piece of reflective glass. Square, rectangular, rhomboid, knife-shaped, polygonal, multi-pointed…. Pieced together, it has become a large mirror. A wondrous, all-powerful mirror. The bureaucracy of this organization has been exposed, the shadows of many idle people have been exposed, nonsensical instructions have been exposed, the goods sleeping at the bottom of the warehouse have been exposed, the money squandered in the safe has been exposed, and even the tumors in some people's brains have been exposed. … Now, the collective doctors here are busy in front of this mirror. Indeed! With the illness so clear, how can we not quickly take medicine or perform surgery?

    差不多是这里所有的人，都献出了一块反光的玻璃。正方的，长方的，菱形的，刀形的，多角的，多尖的……。拼在一起，竟成了一面大镜子。一面奇妙的万能镜。这个机关的臃肿像被照出来了，许多闲散的人影子被照出来了，牛头不对马嘴的指示被照出来了，仓库底层睡迷了的物资被照出来了，保险箱里虚掷出去的金钱被照出来了，某些人脑子里的瘤也被照出来了。……现在，这里的集体的医生，正在这镜子前边忙个不休。是啊！病情这样清楚了，怎能不赶快服药或动手术？
