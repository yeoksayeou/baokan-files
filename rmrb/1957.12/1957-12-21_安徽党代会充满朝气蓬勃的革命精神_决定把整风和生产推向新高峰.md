The Anhui Party Congress Full of Vigorous Revolutionary Spirit
Decides to Push Rectification and Production to New Heights

(Our Dispatch) The Second Session of the First Anhui Provincial Congress of the Communist Party of China concluded on the 13th of this month. The conference decided to push rectification and production to new heights.

Prior to the official session, the conference held nearly half a month of preparatory meetings. During the preparatory meetings, the delegates earnestly studied the documents of the Eighth Central Committee's Third Plenary Session, discussed and revised the Provincial Party Committee's report, and, following the previous four-level cadre meeting, once again conducted airing of views and debates, sternly criticizing the right-leaning conservative thinking of leaders at all levels. The conference officially opened on the 9th. Throughout the preparatory meetings and the conference discussions, the atmosphere was filled with a vigorous revolutionary spirit.

In his opening address at the formal session, Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, stated that the three central tasks of the province, as determined by the First Session of the Party Congress in accordance with the requirements of the overall national mission, had been successfully completed. These three tasks were: to complete and exceed the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, to further improve and consolidate agricultural cooperativization, and to further overcome natural disasters. He said that in the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, capital construction could complete 149%, local industry could complete 108.2%, and grain production completed 125.5%, meaning that the planned targets had been completed and exceeded ahead of schedule. In terms of agricultural cooperativization, the anti-socialist countercurrent had been defeated through the criticism of rural capitalist and individualistic thinking; the right-leaning thinking among cadres had also been criticized, greatly enhancing their enterprising spirit and combativeness, and agricultural cooperativization had achieved the goal of improvement and consolidation. Great achievements had also been made in the struggle against natural disasters. This year, the fierce attack of the bourgeois rightists was repelled through the anti-rightist struggle, raising the consciousness of cadres and the masses and giving them exercise. He said that the task of this conference was to implement the spirit of the Eighth Central Committee's Third Plenary Session and to create a good start for realizing the Second Five-Year Plan and the Agricultural Development Program.

In response to the Provincial Party Committee's call, the conference discussed the Provincial Party Committee's reports on "Continuing to Deepen and Launch a Nationwide Rectification Movement," "Striving to Achieve and Exceed the Agricultural Development Program Ahead of Schedule," and "On Further Completing the Streamlining Task." In terms of rectification, the conference believed that on the basis of winning the anti-rightist struggle, a high tide of thorough rectification and reform should be created with full vigor. It was also believed that this high tide would not emerge spontaneously, requiring organization and mobilization, and requiring leading cadres of various units to set an example and take the lead in rectification and reform. The conference criticized certain tendencies of neglecting rectification and reform, and of making promises and reforms carelessly. The conference believed that upholding the mass line and promoting democratic style should be the focus of inspection in rectification and reform.

In terms of realizing the Agricultural Development Program, the conference believed that Anhui's agricultural cooperativization was basically consolidated, that the method of promoting the three reforms of agricultural production already had a foundation, and that the natural conditions were good and the masses had the habit of enduring hardship, so there were favorable conditions for completing and exceeding the program ahead of schedule. Based on these conditions, the conference agreed with the Provincial Party Committee's requirement that 60% to 70% of the various targets required by the Agricultural Development Program be completed by 1962. In terms of grain production, efforts should be made to greatly exceed this number, reaching around 40 billion jin by 1962 and over 50 billion jin by 1967 (according to the requirements of the program, Anhui's grain target for 1967 should be 48.3 billion jin). The conference believed that next year is a very important year for realizing the Agricultural Development Program, and that all possible means should be used to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest next year, increasing grain production from this year's 24 billion jin (Anhui Province's highest annual output in history) by another 3 billion jin to 4 billion jin, reaching 28 billion jin.

In terms of further streamlining, the province has already streamlined more than 58,000 people this year, of whom more than 48,000 have been directly投入 to the labor production front. In addition, more than 30,000 cadres have been transferred downwards. The conference agreed with the Provincial Party Committee's plan for further streamlining, that is, to transfer another 43,000 people downwards throughout the province.

During the conference discussions, all localities were filled with confidence in implementing the above three requirements. Representatives from the rice-producing counties on both sides of the Yangtze River, such as Lujiang, Hanshan, Dangtu, Wuhu, Fanchang, Nanling, Tongcheng, Huaining, Taihu, Zongyang, Qingyang, Wangjiang, Quanjiao, and Shucheng, all stated that they would strive to become 800-jin counties next year. According to the plans of various prefectural committees, the Anqing Special District will achieve a grain yield of 800 jin per mu and a cotton yield of 100 jin per mu within three to four years; the Wuhu Special District will increase grain production to 860 jin within five years. In addition, the Fuyang Special District in Huaibei will reach the requirement of 500 jin per mu by 1962, and the Bengbu and Liu'an Special Districts will also greatly advance and exceed the targets set by the Agricultural Program within ten years. Representatives from Funan, Jieshou, and Dangshan counties in Huaibei also stated that they would achieve the 500-jin county target ahead of schedule next year, reaching the targets set by the revised draft of the Agricultural Development Program.

Responsible persons from various departments stated in their speeches that they would support all localities in achieving the above goals from all aspects. The slogan put forward by the Provincial Party Committee to the people of the province is: Use all labor, exhaust all intelligence, tap all potential, turn low yield into high yield, turn backward into advanced, turn Huaibei into Jiangnan, turn the沿江 area into 岭南 (referring to three seasons of continuous cropping). All delegates and cadres attending the meeting unanimously stated that they would work hard to realize this slogan.

    安徽党代会充满朝气蓬勃的革命精神
    决定把整风和生产推向新高峰
    本报讯  中共安徽省第一届代表大会第二次会议，已于本月13日闭幕。会议决定把整风和生产推向新的高峰。
    这次大会在开正式会议之前，还举行了近半个月的预备会议。在预备会议期间，代表们认真学习了八届三中全会的文件，讨论和修正了省委的报告，同时继上次四级干部会议，再次进行了鸣放和辩论，严正批判了各级领导的右倾保守思想。大会在9日正式开幕。无论在预备会议和大会的讨论期间，从头到尾都充满了朝气蓬勃的革命精神。
    在正式会议的开会词中，中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣同志说，在第一届党代会第一次会议上，根据国家总任务的要求决定的全省三项中心任务，已经胜利完成。这三项任务是：提前和超额完成第一个五年计划，进一步提高和巩固农业合作化，进一步战胜自然灾害。他说，在执行第一个五年计划方面，基本建设能完成149％，地方工业能完成108.2％，粮食产量完成了125.5％，这就是说预定指标已提前和超额完成了。在农业合作化方面，经过对农村资本主义思想和个人主义思想的批判，反社会主义逆流已被击退；干部中的右倾思想也已经受到批判，进取心和战斗性大大增强，农业合作化已经达到了提高和巩固的目的。在和自然灾害作斗争方面，也取得了巨大成绩。今年经过反右派斗争又打退了资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻，使干部和群众都提高了觉悟，受到了锻炼。他说，这次会议的任务，就是要贯彻八届三中全会的精神，为实现第二个五年计划，为实现农业发展纲要创造一个良好的开端。
    大会根据省委的号召，讨论了省委提出的“关于继续深入和开展全民性整风运动的报告”、“为提前和超额实现农业发展纲要而奋斗”的报告、“关于进一步完成整编任务的报告”。在整风方面，大会认为在反右派斗争取得胜利的基础上，要以十足的劲头造成一个高度的整改热潮。并认为这个高潮不可能自发地出现，需要去组织去发动，需要各单位领导干部以身作则，带头整改。大会上批判了某些不重视整改和随便许愿乱改的偏向。大会认为，在整改中应把坚持群众路线、发扬民主作风作为检查重点。
    在实现农业发展纲要方面，大会认为安徽的农业合作化基本上是巩固的，推行农业生产三项改革的办法已经有了基础，自然条件较好、群众有吃苦耐劳的习惯，所以有提前和超额完成的有利条件。根据这些条件，大会同意省委的要求，即在1962年完成农业发展纲要所要求的各项指标的60％到70％。在粮食生产方面，要争取大大超过这个数字，在1962年达到四百亿斤左右，1967年达到五百亿斤以上（按照纲要的要求安徽1967年的粮食指标应是四百八十三亿斤）。大会认为，明年是实现农业发展纲要十分重要的一年，要想尽办法争取明年的全面大丰收，把粮食产量从今年的二百四十亿斤（安徽省历史上最高年产量），再提高三十亿斤到四十亿斤，达到二百八十亿斤。
    在进一步整编方面，全省今年已经精简了五万八千多人，其中直接投入劳动生产战线上的四万八千多人。另外，还有三万多干部下放。大会同意省委进一步整编的方案，即在全省再下放四万三千人。
    在大会讨论期间，各地对贯彻执行以上三方面的要求充满了信心。长江两岸水稻产区的庐江、含山、当涂、芜湖、繁昌、南陵、桐城、怀宁、太湖、枞阳、青阳、望江、全椒、舒城等县的代表，都表示明年要争取成为八百斤县。按照各地委的计划，安庆专区全区将在三年到四年内实现粮食亩产八百斤，皮棉亩产一百斤；芜湖专区将在五年内将粮食产量提高到八百六十斤。此外，淮北的阜阳专区1962年将达到亩产五百斤的要求，蚌埠及六安两个专区十年内也将大大提前和超额实现农业纲要所提出的指标。淮北阜南、界首、砀山三县的代表也都表示在明年即提前实现五百斤县，达到农业发展纲要修正草案所提的指标。
    各部门的负责人在发言中，都表示要从各方面支援各地实现上述目标。省委向全省人民提出的口号是：用尽劳力，竭尽智力，挖尽潜力，把低产变为高产，把落后变为先进，把淮北变为江南，把沿江变为岭南（指三季连作）。全体代表和列席干部一致表示要为实现这个口号而努力。
