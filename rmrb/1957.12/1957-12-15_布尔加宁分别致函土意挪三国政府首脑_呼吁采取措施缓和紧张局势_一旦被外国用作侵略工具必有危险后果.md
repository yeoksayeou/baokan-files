Xinhua News Agency, December 14th, Moscow, December 14th (TASS): Moscow newspapers today published the full text of the letter from Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Bulganin, to Turkish Prime Minister Menderes.

In his letter, Bulganin pointed out that the upcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council in Paris would discuss a new military strategy plan aimed at greatly strengthening the nuclear war preparations of the member states of this military alliance, including the United States' plan to establish new nuclear and rocket weapon bases in the territories of other NATO members.

Bulganin said that if the plans to combine the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization were realized, any country participating in NATO would be bound by military obligations shared with many countries thousands of miles away in the Far East, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific coast.

Bulganin asked: Does Turkey have interests in these distant regions that would justify it undertaking these new obligations? These obligations would only greatly increase the risk of Turkey being drawn into military conflicts.

The Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers reminded that the Soviet Union is very concerned about maintaining peace in the Near and Middle East. The Soviet government has had to explain to the Turkish government its concerns about the consequences that the activities of a military bloc composed of some countries, including Turkey, may cause.

Bulganin wrote that statements from American military representatives and Turkish officials indicate that the military bases and airfields established on Turkish territory will, in the event of war, be fully controlled by the NATO command and used to strike some extremely important centers of the Soviet Union. The NATO command, in its military plans, stipulates that the international waterway, the Black Sea Straits, be used against the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Turkish government has agreed to establish and deploy American atomic forces on Turkish territory.

The Soviet government draws the attention of the Turkish government to the fact that the use of Turkish territory by foreign powers for war preparations aimed against Turkey's neighbors will place Turkey in an extremely dangerous position.

The Soviet government, in the most friendly manner, warns Turkey of the consequences that Turkey's participation in NATO's war preparations will entail and draws its attention to the dangerous nature of the plans to be studied by the NATO Council meeting for the cause of peace.

In his letter, Bulganin clarified the proposals that could guarantee world peace. He went on to point out that it would be of great significance if the major powers abandoned the deployment of any type of nuclear weapon on foreign territory (including Turkish territory).

Bulganin concluded his letter by saying that the Soviet government believes that if the Turkish government demonstrates initiative in promoting the resolution of the urgent task of strengthening international trust, it will be a valuable contribution to consolidating peace in the Near and Middle East and world peace, and it will also help to establish genuine good-neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey.

Xinhua News Agency, December 14th, Moscow, December 14th (TASS): Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin wrote a letter to Italian Prime Minister Zoli. The Soviet Ambassador to Italy handed over the letter to the Italian Prime Minister on December 13th. Moscow newspapers published the letter today.

Bulganin said: The Cold War is making countries increasingly distrustful of each other and is extremely sharpening the international situation. The only explanation for the fact that American bombers carrying atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs are flying over Britain and France today, and possibly over Italy as well, is that some people are intent on intensifying war hysteria and further exacerbating the situation.

In his letter, Bulganin reiterated the Soviet proposal: that relevant countries agree not to use nuclear weapons and to stop all nuclear weapons testing, even for a period of two or three years. Bulganin also expressed the hope that these Soviet proposals would receive the support of Italy.

Bulganin said, "We have never doubted, and do not doubt now, the peace-loving nature of the Italian people." He said, "But it must not be forgotten that Italy is a member of a military bloc, and it has been proven that this military bloc is preparing for a war of aggression." The letter said that if the plan to intensify preparations for a new war is adopted by the NATO Council meeting, then Italy's hands will be tied.

Bulganin continued, "Can it be denied that the stationing of foreign land, sea, and air forces equipped with thermonuclear weapons on Italian bases poses a serious threat to the safety of the Italian people?"

The Soviet head of government said that, from the standpoint of safeguarding world peace, it is necessary to recognize very definitively the coexistence of capitalist and socialist countries in the world today. Any attempt to forcibly change borders will lead to tragic consequences.

Bulganin also mentioned in his letter the importance of the major powers not deploying any kind of nuclear weapon on foreign territory (including Italian territory, of course).

Bulganin spoke about Soviet-Italian relations in his letter. He said that improving relations between the Soviet Union and Italy is not only in the interests of both countries, but will also help to ease international tensions and consolidate peace.

Bulganin expressed his belief that Italy can undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the common cause of consolidating world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, December 14th, Moscow, December 14th (TASS): Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin wrote a letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen, saying: "We believe that if Norway takes into account its geographical location and international relations, it will play an important role in achieving measures to ease tensions and build international trust."

In this letter, which was handed to the Norwegian Prime Minister by the Soviet Ambassador on December 13th, are contained a number of proposals aimed at preventing further exacerbation of the international situation and preventing the intensification of the arms race.

Bulganin pointed out that, under the current circumstances, it is of great significance that the major powers do not deploy any type of nuclear weapon on the territory of other countries, including Norway. At the same time, the Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers drew attention to the fact that if the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain reached an agreement not to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of West Germany and East Germany, and the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, as well as Poland and Czechoslovakia, neither produced nor deployed nuclear weapons on their own territory, there would be a vast region without atomic weapons in Central Europe with more than 100 million inhabitants, which would be a factor that would greatly reduce the threat of atomic war.

Bulganin said that, while putting forward our own proposals for improving the international situation, we are prepared to study, in the most goodwill spirit, the proposals that other countries may put forward for ensuring international peace, and in particular, peace in Central Europe.

Bulganin expressed the hope that Norway would make every effort, together with other countries, to promote the prevention of further exacerbation of the international situation and to prevent the strengthening of the arms race.

　　布尔加宁分别致函土意挪三国政府首脑
    呼吁采取措施缓和紧张局势
    一旦被外国用作侵略工具必有危险后果
    据新华社14日讯　塔斯社莫斯科14日讯：莫斯科报纸今天刊载了苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁给土耳其总理曼德列斯的信件的全文。
    布尔加宁在信中指出，即将在巴黎举行的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议，将要讨论目的在大大加强这个军事联盟成员国进行原子战争的军事准备工作的新军事战略计划，其中包括美国在北大西洋公约组织其他成员国境内建立新的核武器和火箭武器基地的计划。　　布尔加宁说，如果联合北大西洋公约组织、巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织的计划一旦实现，参加北大西洋公约组织的任何一个国家，就会受到同和它相隔数千公里的远东、东南亚和太平洋沿岸的许多国家共同承担的军事义务的约束。
    布尔加宁问道：土耳其在这些遥远的地区是否有着使它有理由承担这些新义务的利益呢？这种义务只会大大扩大使土耳其卷入军事冲突的危险。
    苏联部长会议主席提醒说，苏联非常关心维护中近东的和平。苏联政府才不得不向土耳其政府说明，它对有土耳其在内的一些国家所组成的军事集团的活动可能引起的后果表示忧虑。
    布尔加宁写道，从美国的军事代表和土耳其的官方人士的声明中可以看出，在土耳其领土上建立的军事基地和飞机场到一旦发生战争时，便将交由北大西洋公约组织司令部全权支配，并且把它们用来打击苏联的一些极为重要的中心。北大西洋公约组织司令部在自己的军事计划中规定要利用国际海道黑海海峡来反对苏联。同时土耳其政府已经同意在土耳其领土上建立和配置美国原子军队。
    苏联政府提请土耳其政府注意，外国利用土耳其的领土进行旨在反对土耳其邻国的战争准备，将使土耳其处于极其危险的地位。
    苏联政府以最友好的方式警告土耳其，土耳其参加北大西洋公约组织的战争准备会招致什么样的后果，并且要它注意北大西洋公约组织理事会会议准备研究的计划对于和平事业的危险性质。
    布尔加宁在信中阐明了能够保障世界和平的建议。他接着指出，各大国放弃在别国领土（其中也包括土耳其领土）设置任何类型的核武器，这会具有重大意义。
    布尔加宁的信最后说，苏联政府认为，土耳其政府如果在促进解决加强国际信任这个迫切任务方面表现出主动精神，将会是巩固中近东和平和世界和平事业的一个宝贵贡献，而且这样做也将有助于建立苏联和土耳其之间的真正睦邻关系。
    据新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科14日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁写信给意大利总理佐利。苏联驻意大利大使12月13日把这封信交给了意大利总理。莫斯科报纸今天发表了这封信。
    布尔加宁说：冷战使国与国之间愈来愈不信任，使国际局势极端尖锐化。载着原子弹和氢弹的美国轰炸机今天在英国和法国上空、也可能在意大利上空飞来飞去这一事实的唯一解释，就是有人一心想加剧战争狂，想使局势进一步尖锐化。
    布尔加宁在信中再度提到苏联的建议：有关国家约定不使用核武器，停止一切核武器试验，哪怕是为期两三年也好。布尔加宁同时希望苏联的这些建议能得到意大利的支持。
    布尔加宁说，我们过去和现在从不曾对意大利人民的爱好和平表示过怀疑。他说，但是也不能忘记，意大利是一个军事集团的成员国，而事实证明，这个军事集团正在准备侵略战争。信中说，如果加紧准备新战争的计划一被北大西洋公约组织理事会会议通过，那么，意大利的手足就会被束缚起来了。
    布尔加宁继续说，在意大利的基地上驻扎有配备着热核武器的外国陆海空军对意大利人民的安全是严重威胁，这一点难道能否认吗。
    苏联政府首脑说，如果从保障世界和平的利益出发，就必须十分肯定地承认今天世界上资本主义国家和社会主义国家并存的局面。想要强行改变疆界的一切企图都会得到悲惨的结局。
    布尔加宁在信中还提到大国不在别国境内（当然也包括在意大利境内）配置任何种类的核武器具有的重要意义。
    布尔加宁在信中谈到了苏意关系。他说，改善苏联和意大利之间的关系不仅符合两国的利益，而且还将有助于缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平。
    布尔加宁表示相信，意大利无疑能对巩固世界和平的共同事业作出重大的贡献。
    据新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科14日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁写信给挪威首相基哈德森说：我们相信，挪威假如考虑到它的地理位置和国际联系，就会在实现缓和紧张局势和建立国际信任的措施方面起重要作用。
    在苏联大使12月13日交给挪威首相的这封信中，包含着一些目的在于防止国际局势进一步尖锐化和防止加紧扩充军备的建议。
    布尔加宁指出，在当前的情况下，大国不在其他国家境内、包括挪威境内配置任何种类核武器一事具有重要意义。同时，苏联部长会议主席提请注意这一事实：如果苏联、美国和英国就不在西德和东德境内配置核武器一事达成协议，而德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国以及波兰和捷克斯洛伐克都不生产和不在本国境内配置核武器，就会在中欧出现一个有一亿以上居民的没有原子武器的辽阔地区，这将成为在很大程度上减轻原子战争威胁的因素。
    布尔加宁说，我们一方面提出自己的关于改进国际局势的建议，同时准备本着最善意的精神来研究其他国家可能提出的保障国际和平、特别是保障中欧和平的建议。
    布尔加宁希望挪威竭尽努力，以便同其他国家一起促进防止国际局势的进一步尖锐化，防止加强扩充军备。
