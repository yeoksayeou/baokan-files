Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from New York: "Why does the world hate America?" This was the topic discussed recently by "New York Post" reporter Mike Wallace when he interviewed Dr. Ernest Dichter, director of the Institute for Motivational Research. Dichter recently made a public opinion survey trip to Europe and the Middle East, and he concluded: "Things couldn't be worse. America's image abroad has deteriorated to an alarming degree. Wherever I went, I encountered extremely blatant anti-American sentiment."

Wallace asked: "What are people criticizing?"

Dichter said: "They criticize everything—from our foreign policy to our food. And this criticism comes from government officials down to ordinary businessmen. A socially prominent person in England said to me: 'Americans are barbarians.' Our international reputation has never been at such a low ebb."

Dichter said that one of the reasons America is disliked is because the United States attaches "political conditions" to its "foreign aid."

He said that another extremely important reason is "a sense of superiority," "We keep telling ourselves that everything in America is bigger and better than other people's... This blatantly offends other countries."

Dichter pointed out, "We talk about freedom, but we support dictatorial regimes like Franco's."

He said that people in the world undoubtedly consider the United States a hypocrite. He called on the United States to honestly admit "we have stagnated, and we are far from perfect."

　　美国到处讨人嫌
　　“纽约邮报”记者主张应当识相些
    新华社9日讯　纽约消息：“为什么世界人士讨厌美国？”这是“纽约邮报”记者迈克·华莱斯最近访问动机研究所主任欧内斯特·迪奇特博士时讨论的题目。迪奇特最近在欧洲和中东作了一次民意调查旅行，他得出结论是：“事情不可能更坏了。美国在国外的形象已经恶化到了惊人的程度。我不论到什么地方，都碰到了极为露骨的反美情绪。”
    华莱斯问道：“人们批评些什么呢？”
    迪奇特说：“对一切都批评——从我们的外交政策起一直到我们的粮食。而这种批评来自上至政府负责官员，下至一般生意人。英格兰一位有社会地位的人对我说：‘美国人是野蛮人。’我们的国际声誉从来没有落到这样的低潮。”
    迪奇特说，美国被人讨厌的原因之一是因为美国在供给“外援”时“附以政治条件”。
    他说，另外一个极重要的原因是“优越感”，“我们喋喋不休对我们自己说，美国的一切东西比人家大、比人家好……这明目张胆地冲犯了其他国家。”
    迪奇特指出，“我们口头上讲自由，然而却支持佛朗哥那样的独裁政权。”
    他说，世界上的人毫无疑问地认为美国是一个伪善者。他要求美国老老实实承认“我们已经停滞不前，我们远不是十全十美”。
