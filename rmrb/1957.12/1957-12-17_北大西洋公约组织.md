　　North Atlantic Treaty Organization
　　The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is an aggressive military bloc formed by the United States after the war to promote the division of the world and the "Cold War" policy. Its spearhead is directed at the Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democracies.
　　The United States first encouraged Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to sign the "Western European Union" treaty in March 1948. Then, on the basis of the "Western European Union," it roped in Canada, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Italy, and Portugal, and formally signed the North Atlantic Treaty on April 4, 1949. In February 1952 and May 1955, the United States brought in Turkey, Greece, and West Germany. Currently, the North Atlantic Group has fifteen member states.
　　The supreme authority of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is the Council, which meets two to three times a year and is attended by the foreign ministers, defense ministers, and finance ministers of each member state. When necessary, it can be attended by the prime ministers or premiers of each country. When the Council is not in session, the Permanent Council acts on its behalf, but cannot make decisions.
　　The Council has a Military Committee composed of the chiefs of staff of each member state. Its permanent body is the Standing Committee, which has the power to make major military decisions and is responsible for studying general strategic issues. Under the Standing Committee are seven special military agencies and three command headquarters. Among the three command headquarters, the Atlantic Naval Command and the Straits Command are actually not very effective. The main one is the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), whose task is to train the North Atlantic Group's troops in peacetime and to direct operations in wartime. It has four command headquarters: Northern Europe, Central Europe, Southern Europe, and the Mediterranean.
　　In the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the United States holds the controlling power. The most important SHAPE has always been commanded by an American general. All major military institutions are located in the United States.
　　After the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it stepped up its arms expansion and war preparations. The Brussels meeting of the Council in 1950 called for the establishment of a seventy-five division North Atlantic Group army under the unified command of Eisenhower. The Lisbon meeting in 1952 further demanded the establishment of ninety-six divisions by the end of 1954. At present, the North Atlantic Group has fifteen divisions available. Since the Council requested in December 1954 that atomic weapons be used as the starting point for formulating strategic plans, the United States has repeatedly planned to equip this army with atomic weapons through the North Atlantic Group. At the same time, the United States has also used the North Atlantic Group to establish a large number of military bases. The number of military airfields alone has increased from five in 1949 to nearly two hundred at present.
　　Between 1949 and 1954, the central topic of the successive Council meetings has been how to rearm West Germany and establish an aggressive force with the West German army as the backbone. According to the plan, West Germany was to provide twelve divisions by the end of 1958, and it has now provided more than half of that number. Former Nazi General Speidel also took over as the commander of the ground forces of the Central European Command earlier this year. The United States is trying to turn West Germany into a base for storing and deploying nuclear weapons and rockets.
　　The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is not only a tool used by the United States to prepare for war, but also a tool used to control and enslave Western European countries. According to the provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty, the United States can use its military and political control over the North Atlantic Group to place the armies, air defenses, bases, transportation lines, and resources of Western European member states under its control, serving the United States' arms expansion and war preparation plans. The 400,000 American military personnel stationed in Europe enjoy extraterritorial rights and can arbitrarily insult local residents. Dulles once openly said: The concept of sovereignty has become an obsolete and stale thing.
　　The plan to readjust and expand arms expansion and war preparation activities that the United States is preparing to submit to the North Atlantic Group's top-level meeting is to use the guise of "mutual dependence" to force countries to give up more sovereignty, establish missile bases, store nuclear weapons and rockets, and concentrate the scientific and technological know-how and resources of various countries to accelerate arms expansion and war preparation.

### 北大西洋公约组织

　　北大西洋公约组织
    北大西洋公约组织是战后美国为推行分裂世界和“冷战”政策而组成的侵略性军事集团，其矛头是指向苏联和东欧人民民主国家的。
    美国先在1948年3月鼓励英、法、荷、比、卢签订了“西欧联盟”条约，然后在“西欧联盟”的基础上，拉拢加拿大、丹麦、挪威、冰岛、意大利、葡萄牙等国，于1949年4月4日正式签订了北大西洋公约。1952年2月和1955年5月，美国又把土耳其、希腊和西德拉了进去。目前北大西洋集团共有十五个成员国。
    北大西洋公约组织的最高权力机构是理事会，每年开会二至三次，由各成员国外交部长、国防部长和财政部长参加，必要时得由各国总理或首相参加。理事会休会时，由常任理事会代行职务，但不能作出决定。
    理事会下设各成员国参谋总长组成的军事委员会，其常设机构为常设委员会，有权采取重大军事决定，并负责研究一般战略问题。常设委员会下面有七个特别军事机构和三个司令部。在三个司令部中，大西洋海军司令部和海峡司令部实际上没有多大作用，主要的是北大西洋集团军欧洲最高司令部，它的任务在平时是训练北大西洋集团军队，战时则由它指挥作战。它拥有北欧、中欧、南欧和地中海四个司令部。
    在北大西洋公约集团中，美国掌握着控制权。最重要的北大西洋集团军欧洲最高司令部就一直由美国将军担任统帅。一切主要的军事机构都设在美国。
    北大西洋公约组织成立以后，就加紧实行扩军备战。1950年理事会布鲁塞尔会议要求建立一支七十五个师的由艾森豪威尔统一指挥的北大西洋集团军。1952年里斯本会议进一步要求在1954年底建立九十六个师。现在，北大西洋集团可供使用的军队已有十五个师。自1954年12月理事会要求以原子武器作为制订战略计划的出发点以来，美国一再策划通过北大西洋集团来用原子武器装备这支军队。同时，美国还利用北大西洋集团建立了大量的军事基地，单是军用机场就从1949年的五个增加到了目前将近二百个。
    在1949年到1954年之间，历届理事会的中心议题，一直是如何重新武装西德和建立一支以西德军队为骨干的侵略部队。根据计划，西德要在1958年底提供十二个师，现在已提供了一半以上的数目。前纳粹将领斯派达尔也在今年初接任了中欧司令部地面部队司令。美国正在企图把西德变为储存和设置核武器和火箭的基地。
    北大西洋公约组织不仅是美国用来准备战争的工具，而且是用来控制和奴役西欧国家的工具。根据北大西洋公约的规定，美国可以通过它对北大西洋集团的军事政治的控制权，把西欧成员国的军队、空防、基地、交通线和资源置于自己的控制下，为美国的扩军备战计划服务。美国驻在欧洲的四十万军事人员享有治外法权，可以任意污辱当地居民。杜勒斯曾公开说：主权这个概念已成了过时的陈腐的东西。
    这次美国准备提交北大西洋集团最高级会议的重新调整扩军备战活动的计划，就是想用“互相依赖”的幌子来迫使各国放弃更多的主权，建立导弹基地，储存核武器和火箭，并集中各国的科学技术和资源来加速扩军备战。　（徐拔）
