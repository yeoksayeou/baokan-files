    Construction workers are most concerned with how to ensure project quality and speed up project progress so that new factories and mines can be put into production as soon as possible. Zheng Changyi, who is constructing the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, and the bricklaying team he leads, regard promoting advanced experience as a trick to solve this problem. They have completed the first Five-Year Plan two years, six months, and a half month ahead of schedule. Now they are working on the 1960 workload. This is Zheng Changyi laying bricks on the construction site of the steel casting workshop. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Shuming photographed.
