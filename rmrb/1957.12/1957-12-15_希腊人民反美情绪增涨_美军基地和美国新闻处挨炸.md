Xinhua News Agency, December 14th: According to a United Press International report from Athens, a bomb was thrown at the United States Information Service in Athens on the evening of the 12th. Not long after, two explosions occurred at the U.S. Air Force base in Ellinikon. Police authorities believe that these explosions are related to the growing anti-American sentiment in Greece.

As everyone knows, the Greek public is indignant at the United States' stance of supporting British colonial policy on the Cyprus issue. Recently, when the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly discussed the Cyprus issue, the United States still refused to allow the residents of Cyprus to realize their right to self-determination. Reuters also pointed out that the explosions at American military bases in Greece are not the first manifestation of anti-American sentiment in Greece. The news agency mentioned that anti-American actions occurred in Athens in 1955, protesting against the United States' support for Britain on the Cyprus issue. A year ago, thousands of students vandalized the US Information Service branch in Salonika.

    希腊人民反美情绪增涨
    美军基地和美国新闻处挨炸
    新华社14日讯　据合众社雅典消息，12日晚上有人向雅典的美国新闻处投掷了一枚炸弹。不多久以后，在埃利尼孔的美国空军基地也发生了两处爆炸。警察当局认为这些爆炸与希腊国内日益增涨的反美情绪有关。
    大家知道，希腊公众对美国在塞浦路斯问题上采取支持英国殖民政策的立场感到愤慨。最近联合国大会政治委员会讨论塞浦路斯问题时，美国还是不让塞浦路斯居民实现自决权利。另据路透社指出，希腊境内美国军事基地上的爆炸事件，并不是希腊反美情绪的初次表现。这家通讯社提到在1955年雅典就发生过反美行动，抗议美国在塞浦路斯问题上支持英国。一年以前有数千学生曾经捣毁过萨罗尼加的美国新闻处分处。
