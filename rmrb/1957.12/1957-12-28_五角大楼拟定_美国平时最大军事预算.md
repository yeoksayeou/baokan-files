Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 26th: According to TASS, U.S. Defense Department officials have completed the compilation of the new U.S. military budget, which will be the largest military budget in peacetime. It will be submitted to Congress for review next month. It is expected that direct military expenditures for the next fiscal year (starting July 1, 1958) will be around $40 billion, $2 billion more than the originally planned direct military expenditures for this year.

It is reported that the actual direct military expenditure for this year amounted to $39 billion, and this figure does not include approximately $10 billion in U.S. spending on military equipment for its allies, atomic military spending, and other indirect military expenditures. As a result, total military spending this year will exceed 70% of the total U.S. budget.

A significant portion of the military budget is used for missile expenditures and for research and improvement of various military equipment.

    五角大楼拟定
    美国平时最大军事预算
    据新华社27日讯  据塔斯社纽约26日讯：美国国防部的官员们已经结束了美国新的军事预算的编制工作，这个预算将是和平时期最庞大的军事预算。它将在下月提交国会审查。预料，下一个财政年度（自1958年7月1日起）的直接军事开支将为四百亿美元左右，比本年度最初拟定的直接军事开支多二十亿美元。
    据报道，本年度的直接军事开支实际上达三百九十亿美元，美国给它的盟国军备的开支、原子军备开支和其他间接军事开支约一百亿美元还不包括在这个数目内。这样一来，今年总的军事开支将超过美国预算总数的70％。
    军事预算中有相当大一部分用在导弹开支以及研究和改进各种军备上。
