Sterling Crisis

　　For over two months, the British government has taken all measures to try to salvage the shrinking value of the pound, such as: raising bank interest rates; using the $500 million credit from the US Export-Import Bank agreed upon last year; reducing various investments; and suppressing workers' demands for wage increases. However, this series of emergency measures by the British government has not changed the deteriorating situation of the pound's value. The British "Times" published a diagram on November 15 showing the decline of the pound over the past ten years (see the diagram below). From this diagram, it is not difficult to see that the sterling crisis cannot be solved by the British government using the current method of treating the symptoms rather than the cause.

　　From the diagram, it can be seen that the sterling crisis has a long history and its illness is deep-seated. However, until now, the British government has not intended to alleviate the difficulties of the British economy through fundamental ways such as stopping the arms race, reducing military spending, and developing trade between the East and the West. The series of purely technical measures taken by the British government have seriously damaged the interests of the British working people: raising bank interest rates directly hits British farmers, because British farmers have always relied on bank loans to purchase agricultural tools, while it does no harm to the large monopoly organizations; using the credit from the US Export-Import Bank strengthens Britain's economic dependence on the United States; reducing various investments and suppressing workers' demands for wage increases make labor-capital relations in Britain more acute, increase unemployment, and reduce the living standards of the working people.

　　There are ways to save the sterling crisis. The British "Daily Worker" has long pointed out: "If the Conservatives want to save the pound, they have to cut arms spending instead of cutting investment. They have to lift the ban on East-West trade instead of raising bank interest rates."

### 英镑危机

　　英镑危机
    两个多月以来，英国政府采取了一切措施力图挽救英镑价值日益萎缩的危机，例如：提高银行利率；动用去年谈妥的由美国进出口银行贷予的五亿美元的信贷；减少各项投资；压制工人的提高工资的要求。可是英国政府这一系列紧急措施并没有改变英镑价值江河日下的情况。英国“泰晤士报”11月15日发表了十年来英镑下跌情况的图解（见下图）。从这个图解里不难看出：英镑的危机决不是英国政府利用目前这种扬汤止沸的办法所能解决的。
    从图解里可以看出，英镑危机由来已久，其病已深。可是直到现在英国政府还没有打算从停止军备竞赛、缩减军费、发展东西方贸易这些根本途径来解除英国经济的困难。英国政府所采取的一系列纯技术性的措施，严重地损害了英国劳动人民的利益：提高银行利率，直接打击了英国的农民，因为英国农民一向依靠银行贷款购买农具，而对大垄断组织并无丝毫害处；动用美国进出口银行的信贷，加强了英国在经济上对美国的依赖；减少各项投资、压制工人的提高工资的要求，使英国国内劳资关系更加尖锐化、失业人口增加、劳动人民生活水平日益降低。
    挽救英镑危机的途径并不是没有的。英国“工人日报”早已指出：“如果保守党要拯救英镑，他们就得削减军备开支而不是削减投资。他们就得取消对东西方贸易的禁令，而不是提高银行的利率。”
