Guanzhuang Will Definitely Be Managed Well

    Guanzhuang, located more than forty li in the eastern suburbs of Beijing, is home to about 10,000 people from ten directly affiliated units of central government agencies. It was built along with the rapid development of the country's construction endeavors.

    Although it boasts a building complex of more than 400,000 square meters, ten government units, and a population of around 10,000, it has long been in a state of chaotic mismanagement. Many bad phenomena have been occurring constantly.

    After the chaotic situation in Guanzhuang was revealed during the rectification campaign, the State Council attached great importance to it and quickly dispatched a five-person working group to work with the Party and administrative leaders of Guanzhuang to mobilize the masses to thoroughly change the chaotic situation. Currently, the masses have taken action to expose the problems in Guanzhuang, determined to rectify Guanzhuang.

    The picture below shows a corner of Guanzhuang. A few years ago, this place was farmland. Now it is a beautiful building complex.

    The five-person working group of the State Council has arrived in Guanzhuang. This is a cadre from the working group (first from the right) learning about the problems of Guanzhuang from the masses.

    All the members of the Communist Youth League of the Technical and Economic Section of the Cement Design Institute used big-character posters to give opinions to the leaders of the unit, helping the leaders to eliminate the chaotic phenomenon of the "free kingdom." What can be done is being done immediately. Guanzhuang has begun registering households.

    管庄一定能管好
    管庄，这个座落在北京市东郊四十多里的、居住着中央机关十个直属单位大约一万多人口的地方，是随着国家建设事业的迅速发展而建设起来的。
    这里虽然拥有四十多万平方公尺的建筑群，十个机关单位，上万左右的人口，但是长期以来却处于无人管理的混乱状态。许许多多的坏现象不断发生。
    整风中，管庄的混乱现象被揭发后，国务院十分重视，迅速派遣五人工作组，与管庄的党和行政领导一起，发动群众彻底地改变管庄的混乱现象。目前群众已行动起来，揭发管庄的问题，决心把管庄整顿好。
    下图是管庄的一角。几年前，这里还是庄稼地。现在却是一片漂亮的建筑群。
    国务院的五人工作组已经来到管庄。这是工作组干部（右第一人）在向群众了解管庄的问题。
    水泥设计院技术经济科的全体共青团员用大字报向机关领导提意见，帮助领导消除“自由王国”的混乱现象。能办的立即办。管庄已经开始登记户口。
