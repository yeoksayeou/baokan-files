    Determined to Be a Cultured Farmer
　　Zhao Shuli's Daughter Goes to the Countryside
    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) The writer Zhao Shuli's daughter, Zhao Guangjian, took a bus north on the evening of November 24th to settle down in her hometown of Qinshui County and become a cultured young member of the commune.
    Comrade Zhao Guangjian is twenty-one years old this year. Since 1945, when she left with her father, she has not lived with farmers. After the liberation of Beijing, she entered the city with her father. For the past eight or nine years, she has lived in the city, studying and living under the meticulous care of her parents. She has gradually forgotten the labor and life of the countryside. Her thinking has become separated from the broad masses of working people. As her father said, she "looks down on the working people," and is unwilling to return to her hometown to participate in agricultural production, or to become a salesperson or barber.
    When the letter that the writer Zhao Shuli sent to his daughter arrived in Yongji, Zhao Guangjian was very uneasy. She was reluctant to leave the city life; she thought, after returning to the countryside, she would have to do everything herself, cooking and sewing, what if she couldn't cook, or sew clothes? Moreover, participating in agricultural production, participating in physical labor, requires being able to endure hardship and withstand the scorching sun! Zhao Guangjian was struggling with her thoughts.
    Through her father's patient help, and after seeing many vivid examples of young people going to the countryside to engage in agricultural production, Zhao Guangjian gradually came to understand and her idea of returning to the countryside as a cultured young commune member gradually strengthened and solidified.
    When Zhao Guangjian left Yongji to go to Qinshui to participate in agricultural production, her colleagues and friends were very happy. Some comrades took pictures with her, and some comrades signed and left messages in her notebook. At the time of parting, Zhao Guangjian said to everyone: "Please rest assured, I will never let you down." She is determined to become a veritable agricultural commune member in three to five years.

### 决心做一个有文化的农民　赵树理的女儿走向农村

    决心做一个有文化的农民
　　赵树理的女儿走向农村
    本报讯　作家赵树理的女儿赵广建，11月24日晚上，已经乘车北上到故乡沁水县农村安家落户，当一个有文化的青年社员。
    赵广建同志今年二十一岁，从1945年随父亲出外以后，再没有同农民生活在一起。北京解放以后，她同父亲进入城市。八、九年来，她一直住在都市里，在父母的无微不至的关怀下面学习着和生活着，她对农村的劳动和生活已经逐渐淡忘。她的思想同广大的劳动人民分了家，正如她的爸爸所说，她“看不起劳动人民”，不愿回原籍参加农业生产，不愿当售货员或理发员。
    当作家赵树理给女儿的信寄到永济以后，赵广建的情绪十分不安。她留恋城市生活；她想，回农村以后，做饭、缝补，什么都要自己动手，如果做不了饭，缝不成衣服怎么办？何况参加农业生产，参加体力劳动，更要吃得起苦，要经受得住炎晒呵！赵广建的思想斗争着。
    赵广建经过她父亲的耐心帮助，同时看到各地下乡青年在农业生产中的许多生动事例，她渐渐想通了，回农村当一个有文化的青年社员的思想，逐渐坚定起来，巩固起来。
    当赵广建离开永济去沁水参加农业生产的时候，她的同事们和朋友们都十分欣喜。有的同志同她一起照相，有些同志在她的笔记本上签字留言。临别的时候，赵广建对大家说：“请放心，我决不会给大家丢脸。”她决心在三、五年里成为一个名副其实的农业社社员。
