    Little Poem at Year's End
    Zang Kejia
    My heart is solemn and yet excited
    I walked into such a building,
    A splash of color illuminated my eyes,
    Like one patch of colorful clouds after another,
    Illuminating the boundless clear sky.
    I gently rise and fall with my steps,
    My mood is solemn and yet excited,
    Like walking into a mass meeting place,
    A great debate is underway.
    I listen to each impassioned speech,
    Gesticulating, look at his face flushed crimson;
    One precious suggestion after another,
    Yet its proposer is so modest.
    Every line of characters on this red and green paper,
    Is a stream of sharp gazes,
    They are a tight organization,
    Mistakes and shortcomings cannot escape the net.
    Every sentence on this red and green paper,
    Comes from a heart of love for the motherland,
    It is the crystallization of the wisdom of the masses,
    Driving the socialist cause to advance by leaps and bounds!
    I walked into such a building,
    A splash of color illuminated my eyes,
    I gently rise and fall with my steps,
    My heart is solemn and yet excited.
    Clever Clouds
    At dusk, walking out of the city gate,
    Sitting on the blue stone by the river,
    Me and my little girl,
    Side by side watching clever clouds.
    Her eyes are growing in the sky.
    She is creating, she is discovering:
    Ah, big chimneys; ah, tractors; ah, warships...
    She cheers for the spectacle in the sky.
    Very early, I came to the original place alone,
    The sun has not yet appeared,
    The eastern half is bright and beautiful,
    It heralds the beginning of a bright daylight.
    One chimney after another,
    The huge shadows of one tall building after another,
    How moving this scene is -
    Clever clouds rooted in this earth.

    岁末小诗
    臧克家
    我的心严肃而又激动
    我走进了这样一座楼房，
    一片彩色照亮了我的眼睛，
    像一片又一片彩云，
    照亮了万里晴空。
    我轻轻地起落着脚步，
    心情严肃而又激动，
    像走进了一个群众大会场，
    一场大辩论正在进行。
    我听着一句句激昂的发言，
    指手划脚，你看他的面孔涨得绯红；
    一条又一条建议多么宝贵，
    它的建议人却是那样谦躬。
    这红纸绿纸上的每一行字，
    就是一注注锐利的眼光，
    它们是一个严密的组织，
    错误和缺点别想漏网。
    这红纸绿纸上的每一句话，
    发自热爱祖国的忠心，
    它是群众智慧的结晶，
    推动着社会主义事业突飞猛晋！
    我走进了这样一座楼房，
    一片彩色照亮了我的眼睛，
    我轻轻地起落着脚步，
    我的心严肃而又激动。
    巧云
    傍晚，走出城门，
    坐在河边的青石上，
    我和我的小女孩，
    并肩看巧云。
    她的眼长在天上。
    她在创造，她在发现：
    呵，大烟囱；呵，拖拉机；呵，军舰……
    她欢呼这天空里的奇观。
    绝早，我独个儿来到原来的地方，
    太阳还没有露面，
    东方的半壁一片明丽，
    它昭示了光明白昼的开始。
    一支又一支烟囱，
    一座又一座高楼的巨影，
    这景象多么动人——
    这大地上扎了根的巧云。
