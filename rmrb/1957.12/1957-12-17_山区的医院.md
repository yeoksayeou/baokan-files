    Hospitals in Mountainous Areas
    (Reported by this newspaper) Shanxi Province has established forty-six rural area hospitals in old revolutionary base areas such as the Taihang Mountains, Zhongtiao Mountains, and Lüliang Mountains. These hospitals are equipped with six hundred and seventy-four simple beds. Some of the beds for inpatients are earthen beds, and some are beds made of wooden planks. Each ward is equipped with a stove, and patients can bring their families to take care of them; they can prepare their own meals, and the cost of hospitalization, lighting, water, and charcoal is only 30 cents per day. The universally implemented system in these hospitals is: patients are treated as soon as they arrive, and house calls are made whenever requested.
    The rural area hospitals in Shanxi Province were formed by merging and renovating the original state health clinics and local joint clinics, without any additional investment. The source of funding is mainly from the insurance fees paid by the masses in the township where the hospital is located and from the income from treating illnesses. The state only subsidizes each hospital with 2,800 yuan per year. (Ni Heyi)

    山区的医院
    本报讯　山西省在太行山、中条山、吕梁山等革命老根据地，已经建立了四十六个乡村地区医院。这些医院附设有六百七十四张简易病床。住院的病床有的是土炕，有的是用木板搭起来的床。每个病房里都设有炉灶，病人可以自带家属照顾；可以自起伙食，住院和灯火水炭等费用，每天只收三角钱。这些医院普遍施行的制度是：病人随到随治，出诊也是随叫随到。
    山西省的农村地区医院是把原有的国家卫生所和当地的联合诊所合并改建而成的，没有任何另外投资。经费来源主要是由医院所在乡的群众出保险费和治病的收入来解决，国家每年对每个医院只补助二千八百元。　　　　（倪合一）
