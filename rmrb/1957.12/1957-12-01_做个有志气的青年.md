　　Be an Ambitious Youth
　　Kong Sang
    Recently, many workers have discussed the State Council's provisional regulations (draft) regarding the learning period and living allowance for apprentices. The vast majority of workers, including veteran workers, young workers, and apprentices, said the regulations are good, beneficial to the country, and beneficial to apprentices. However, a small number of apprentices believe that the regulations are not good, saying, "Learning for three years with a monthly living allowance of only a few yuan, what's the difference between this and the old society?"
    Does extending the learning period and reducing the living allowance make it the same as being an apprentice in the old society?
    This question is easy to answer.
    In the old society, there was a very popular saying, "An apprentice is a slave for three years." This means that in the old society, apprentices were treated as slaves by capitalists. To learn a skill, they had to endure all kinds of inhumane treatment: not enough to eat, not enough to wear, being beaten and abused, and not allowed to resist. In the new society, the state recruits tens of thousands of new apprentices every year, and no one has ever heard of anyone suffering the same treatment as in the old society. On the contrary, we often hear many apprentices say that the Party and the government care for them even more attentively than their own parents; we hear many veteran workers say with envy that today's apprentices are so fortunate. According to the newly announced draft regulations, even after the living allowance is reduced, apprentices still do not have to worry about food or medical care (with public medical service), and they still have pocket money to spend. After the learning period is extended, master workers will still teach them techniques hand-in-hand, and the Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations will still care for these young people in all aspects of politics, ideology, and life. Moreover, the new regulations draft announced by the State Council are precisely to enable apprentices to have more ample time to learn skills, undergo labor training, and raise their class consciousness, in order to cultivate them into new workers with both moral integrity and talent. The apprentices in the old society couldn't even dream of the Party and the government caring for apprentices' growth in this way. In a word, even with the extended learning period and reduced living allowance, apprentices in the new and old societies are fundamentally different, practically one in heaven and the other in hell. In fact, apprentices all understand this principle. The real intention of some apprentices who still say strange things like "the same as the old society" is simply that they are reluctant to part with the currently excessively high living standards and want to be promoted quickly.
    It is quite natural for these apprentices to have thoughts of pursuing personal enjoyment and disliking arduous labor. Because many of them grew up after liberation, they have not suffered the hardships of the old society, nor have they experienced labor training. Many of them went to factories after graduating from middle school or higher primary school. They have not been in the factory for a long time, and their ideology has not yet been properly reformed. Of course, it is impossible for them to learn to view problems from the standpoint and viewpoint of the working class. This precisely proves that the current apprenticeship system, due to its excessively short learning period and excessively high living subsidies, is not suitable for reforming the objective needs of new apprentices and must be reformed. Ambitious apprentices should understand the State Council's regulations draft in this way, happily welcome the implementation of this regulations draft, resolve to live a frugal life for a few years, study techniques diligently, transform their thinking, and aspire to be socialist successors with technology, culture, and awareness. Not only must they fully accept the rich technical experience of the veteran workers, but they must also fully inherit their noble qualities of being selfless, considering the interests of the country in everything, and loving labor and being diligent and thrifty.
    Such socialist successors are the hope of our country.

　　做个有志气的青年

    最近，许多职工都讨论了国务院公布的关于学徒的学习期限和生活补贴的暂行规定（草案）。绝大部分职工，其中有老工人、青年工人、也有徒工，都说这个规定好，有利于国家，也有利于徒工。有少数徒工却认为这个规定不好，说：“学习三年，生活补贴一个月只有几块钱，这跟旧社会有啥两样？”
    学习期限延长了一些，生活补贴减少了一些，就同旧社会的学徒一样了吗？
    这个问题很好回答。
    在旧社会里，有句极流行的话，叫做：“学徒学徒，三年为奴。”就是说，在旧社会，学徒是被资本家当作奴隶看待的，为了学点手艺，忍受着种种非人的待遇：吃不饱，穿不暖，还要挨打受气，不准反抗。在新社会里，国家每年新收的学徒数以万计，从来没有人听说过有谁遭受到像旧社会那样的待遇。相反，倒常听见许多学徒说，党和政府关心他们，比爹娘还周到；听见许多老工人羡慕地说，现在的学徒真是太幸福了。按照新公布的规定草案，生活补贴减少以后，学徒在生活上仍然不愁吃，不愁病（有公费医疗），而且还有零钱花。学习期限延长以后，老师傅们仍然会把着手教技术，党、团、工会组织仍然会从政治、思想、生活各方面关怀这些年青人。而且国务院公布的新规定草案，正是为了使徒工们有更充分的时间学习技术，经受劳动锻炼，提高阶级觉悟，以便把他们培养成德才兼备的新工人。像党和政府这样处处关心徒工的成长，旧社会的学徒是连做梦也梦不到的。一句话，即使延长了学习期限和减少了生活补贴，新旧社会的学徒仍然是根本不同，简直是一个在天堂，一个在地狱。其实，这个道理，徒工们都是懂得的。有些徒工所以还要说什么“跟旧社会一样”的怪话，其真意不过是舍不得目前过高的生活待遇，并想急于升级吧了。
    这些徒工有追求个人享受，厌恶艰苦劳动的思想，是很自然的。因为他们中很多人都是在解放以后成长起来的，没有吃过旧社会的苦头，也没有经过劳动锻炼。很多人都是从中学、高小出来以后就到工厂，他们进工厂时间不长，思想还没改造好，当然不可能学会以工人阶级的立场、观点来看问题。这恰恰证明现行的学徒制度，由于学习期限过短、生活补助过高，不适合改造新徒工的客观需要，实有改革的必要。有志气的徒工，正应该这样来理解国务院的规定草案，愉快地迎接这个规定草案的实行，下决心过几年俭朴的生活，踏踏实实地下苦功学习技术，改造思想，立志做一个有技术、有文化、又有觉悟的社会主义接班人。不仅把老工人们丰富的技术经验全部接受下来，而且把他们那种大公无私、处处考虑国家利益、热爱劳动和勤俭朴素的高贵品质全部继承下来。
    这样的社会主义接班人，就是我们国家的希望。
