To Marshal He Long, Deputy Prime Minister, leaders of the Chinese government, leaders of people's organizations, and all friends:

　　We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude for your welcome here today.

　　More than a year ago, during Premier Zhou Enlai's and Marshal He Long's visit to our country, they invited Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe and me to lead a friendly delegation to visit China. At that time, we had hoped to come immediately, but we were unable to do so. Today, our wish has finally come true.

　　In fact, our delegation is not the first friendly delegation from Burma to visit China. Our two countries are close neighbors, and we have always had many friendly exchanges in the past. For example, Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister U Nu have made many friendly visits to each other. Various delegations from both countries have also exchanged visits.

　　When our delegation comes to China, it feels like visiting our own relatives and brothers, because we Burmese have always regarded the Chinese people as our "Pauk-Phaw" (kin). Although our delegation has not been to China before, we all feel in our hearts that we are visiting relatives.

　　As Marshal He Long just said, through our mutual friendly visits, the friendly relations between our two countries will become increasingly profound and developed.

　　In our country, the government is actively striving to develop the economy. As we do so, we need to absorb the experience and knowledge of other countries in this regard. We have heard of the achievements and efforts made by China in economic and social construction. This time, when we come to China for a visit, we will focus on studying China's efforts and achievements in economic construction. I express my gratitude for giving us this opportunity.

　　Finally, on behalf of our government and people, and in my own name, I would like to once again express my heartfelt gratitude to Marshal He Long, the leaders of the Chinese government, and the leaders of the people's organizations for your friendly invitation to us.

　　Long live Burmese-Chinese friendship!

　　吴觉迎副总理的讲话以副总理贺龙元帅为首的中国政府领导人，人民团体的领导人，各位朋友：
    今天各位到这里来欢迎我们，我们谨表示衷心的感谢。
    一年多以前，在周恩来总理和贺龙元帅访问我国时，就曾经邀请吴巴瑞副总理和我率领一个友好代表团到中国来访问。当时，我们曾希望马上就来，但没有能成功。今天，我们的愿望终于实现了。
    事实上，我们这个代表团并不是缅甸第一个到中国来访问的友好代表团。我们两国是亲密的邻国，过去，我们之间就一直有着许多友好的往来。譬如，周恩来总理和吴努总理就曾经相互作过多次的友好访问。两国各种代表团也相互作了访问。
    我们代表团来到中国，就好像到了自己的亲戚和兄弟家里一样，因为我们 缅甸人一向把中国人民看做是自己的“胞波”。虽然我们这个代表团没有到中国来过，但我们都从心里感到是像走亲戚一样。
    正如贺龙元帅刚才所说，通过我们相互间的友好访问，我们两国的友好关系就会日益深厚，日益发展。
    在我国，政府正积极努力发展经济，在我们这样做的时候，就需要吸收其他国家这方面的经验和知识。我们已听说过中国在经济建设和社会建设方面所取得的成就和所作的努力。这次我们到中国来访问，就要着重考察中国在进行经济建设方面的努力和成就。由于你们给了我们这样的机会，我表示感谢。
    最后，我谨代表我们的政府和人民，并以我个人的名义，再一次地向以贺龙元帅为首的中国政府领导人，以及人民团体的领导人，表示衷心的感谢，感谢对我们的友好邀请。
    缅中友好万岁！
