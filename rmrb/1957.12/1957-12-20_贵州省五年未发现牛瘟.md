Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 19th – Guizhou Province, where draught cattle breed relatively quickly, has not discovered any rinderpest epidemic since 1953.

Before liberation, Guizhou Province was one of the rinderpest areas in the south. From 1935 to 1949, rinderpest was prevalent in more than 20 counties, killing about 200,000 head of draught cattle. After liberation, the People's Government assigned the Provincial Serum Factory to produce large quantities of organ seedlings and rinderpest serum to prevent and control rinderpest, and established nine epidemic prevention teams throughout the province, sending 135 veterinarians to rinderpest areas for prevention and control. At the same time, in addition to actively organizing folk veterinarians to assist in the prevention and control of rinderpest, the relevant leading departments in various places also educated farmers to strengthen the feeding and management of draught cattle, thus eradicating rinderpest.

After this more harmful disease was eradicated, the breeding speed of draught cattle became faster. There are more than 3.39 million draught cattle in the province this year, an increase of more than 940,000 head compared to 1953. Since liberation, Guizhou Province has transferred about 100,000 head of draught cattle to other provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Hunan every year.

    贵州省五年未发现牛瘟
    新华社贵阳19日电　耕牛繁殖较快的贵州省，从1953年到现在一直没有发现过牛瘟疫情。
    贵州省解放前是南方牛瘟区之一，从1935年到1949年，牛瘟曾在二十多个县内流行，死亡耕牛约二十万头。解放后，人民政府交由省血清厂大量制造了防治牛瘟的脏器苗和牛瘟血清，并在全省建立九个防疫队，派出一百三十五名兽医人员到牛瘟地区进行防治。同时各地有关领导部门除了积极组织民间兽医人员协助防治牛瘟以外，还教育农民加强对耕牛的饲养管理，从而根绝了牛瘟。
    这种危害较大的病疫根除后，耕牛的繁殖速度更快了。全省今年有耕牛三百三十九万多头，比1953年增加九十四万多头。从解放以来，贵州省每年都外调耕牛十万头左右，供应四川、云南、广西、湖南等省。
