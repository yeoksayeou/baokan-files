    Make Full Use of Beet Stems and Leaves
    Our country's Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang and other places produce a lot of sugar beets, with a national production period yielding about two million tons. Sugar beets can not only be used to make sugar, but their stems, leaves, and the waste pulp after sugar production are also highly nutritious feed. However, at present, only three sugar factories in the country have drying workshops, and only 70% of the beet waste pulp is dried and supplied to pastures or exported. Other sugar factories only supply about 10% of the fresh waste pulp to nearby farmers as feed, and the rest is thrown away. The stems and leaves of sugar beets, except for a portion used as feed by agricultural cooperatives in Inner Mongolia, are mostly not well utilized in other regions. It is a great pity that this resource is wasted.
    According to analysis by the Inner Mongolia Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Hospital, the nutritional value of every hundred catties of beet leaves is equivalent to thirteen catties of oats or sorghum. According to experiments, over 80% of ensiled beet stems and leaves can be digested when fed to sheep. The Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Tumote Banner, Inner Mongolia, used beet leaves to feed livestock, and within two months, the condition of the draft cattle increased from 60% to 90%. Pigs fed this kind of feed are also fatter and stronger than those fed ordinary feed.
    It is suggested that beet-producing areas and sugar factories make full use of beet stems, leaves, and sugar-making by-products.

### 充分利用甜菜茎叶

    充分利用甜菜茎叶
    我国吉林、内蒙古、黑龙江等地出产不少甜菜，全国一个生产期就产二百万吨左右。甜菜不仅可以制糖，它的茎、叶和制糖后的废丝，还是一种营养价值很高的饲料。但是，目前全国只有三个糖厂设有干燥车间，仅把70％的甜菜废丝干燥后供应牧场或出口，其他糖厂只把大约10％的鲜废丝供给附近农家作饲料，其余的都被扔掉了。甜菜的茎、叶，除内蒙古地区的农业合作社用一部分做饲料外，其他地区多未很好利用。这项资源的浪费，非常可惜。
    据内蒙古畜牧兽医院分析，每百斤甜菜叶的营养价值等于十三斤燕麦或高粱。据试验，用青贮甜菜茎叶喂羊，80％以上都可以消化。内蒙古土默特旗前进农业社用甜菜叶喂牲畜，两个月时间，耕牛由六成膘增加到九成膘。吃这种饲料的猪，也比喂一般饲料肥壮。
    建议甜菜产区和糖厂把甜菜的茎、叶和制糖副产品充分利用起来。
