Who Threatens U.S. Security?
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    The secret report of the U.S. "Gaither Committee" "believes that the United States will fall into extremely serious danger in 1960," and even says: "From now until 1961, the United States must mainly rely on the goodwill of the Soviet Union to avoid being destroyed." Thus, a group of opinion-shaping experts sounded the war drums, spreading war hysteria, warning the American people that "in order to consolidate national defense, they must sacrifice money and comfort," and eagerly demanded a significant increase in military spending. According to rough estimates, according to the plan in this report, in the dozen or so years from now until the end of 1970, an average of 20 billion or more additional US dollars will have to be spent each year. It turns out that their true intention is elsewhere than in the apparent objective; the so-called "Soviet threat" is just a guise to get money from the people.

    There is no doubt that the balance of power between the world's two major camps is now such that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. The Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in important scientific and technological fields. The launching of artificial satellites finally shattered the dream of the United States possessing military superiority. This is a fact. However, the growing strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union brings not disaster but the gospel of peace to the world. The two major declarations of the Moscow Conference, the series of peace proposals made by the Soviet government to eighty-three countries, and the resolution of the Soviet Supreme Soviet on disarmament have created favorable conditions for stopping the Cold War and the arms race, and have already brought the world the beautiful hope of peaceful coexistence. If the imperialist camp headed by the United States can accept this series of peace proposals, the whole world, including the United States, will be freed from the threat of war. Doesn't this series of peace initiatives by the Soviet Union powerfully prove the Soviet Union's sincere desire for peace? The powerful Soviet Union has never had any intention of invading any country, in the past, present, or future. This point was also publicly pointed out by former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kennan: "The Soviet Union has never invaded other countries by force." In a recent British television discussion program, he further cited facts since the war to prove that the Soviet Union has never attacked other countries. So, where does the "danger" that the "Gaither Committee" trumpets about the United States being in, actually come from?

    If there is any real danger to the United States, it does not come from the Soviet Union, but from the massive arms expansion plan of the "Gaither Committee" and the idea of "launching a preemptive war."

    Isn't that so? With the members of the "Gaither Committee" as the core, the "Alarm Group" was established. The mission of this group is to spread the myth of the Soviet threat every day, keeping the United States in a state of "constant unease," using war propaganda to frighten the people, asking them to "shed blood, sweat, and tears," in order to enable Eisenhower, who is willing to act according to this plan, to no longer "uneasily worry that the American people will refuse to pay this money."

    Isn't that so? The "Gaither Committee's" war plan will not bring about an end to the Cold War and arms reduction, but a frantic arms race, leading to a new war. The frantic arms expansion plan will exhaust the American economy, drain the people's blood and sweat, and trap the people's lives in hardship; the bellicose idea of "preemptive strike" will cause the United States to get burned and suffer the devastating retaliation of atomic war first.

    These are the real threats to U.S. security!

    Will they be frightened by the war cries of the "Gaither Committee" and take the dead end of new arms expansion and preparation for war? Or will they accept the Soviet Union's peace initiative and turn hostility into friendship? The American people and their rational politicians will make their own choices.

    美国安全受谁威胁？
    本报评论员
    美国“盖瑟委员会”的秘密报告，“认为美国在1960年将要陷于极其严重的危险之中”，甚至说：“从现在到1961年这段时间中，美国主要必须依靠苏联的善意才能免于被毁灭”。于是，一群编选舆论的专家敲响了战鼓，散布着战争的歇斯底里，警告美国人民“为了巩固国防必须牺牲金钱和安乐”，急切要求大大地增加军费。据有人粗略估计，按照这个报告的计划，从现在到1970年年底为止的十几年里，平均每年还得多花费二百亿或者更多的美元。原来醉翁之意不在酒，所谓“苏联威胁”不过是向老百姓要钱的幌子而已。
    毫无疑问，世界上两大阵营力量的对比，已经是东风压倒了西风。苏联在重要的科学技术方面，超过了美国。人造卫星的发射，最后打破了美国拥有军事优势的迷梦。这是事实。可是，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，日益强大，为世界带来的却不是灾难而是和平的福音。莫斯科会议的两大宣言，苏联政府向八十三国提出的一系列的和平建议，苏联最高苏维埃代表会议关于裁军问题的决议，这一系列行动为停止冷战和军备竞赛创造了有利的条件，已经给全世界带来了和平共处的美好想望。如果以美国为首的帝国主义阵营能够接受这一系列的和平建议，全世界，包括美国在内，都会从此摆脱战争的威胁。苏联这一系列的和平创议难道不是有力地证明了苏联对于和平的真诚愿望吗？强大的苏联，过去，现在，以至将来，从来没有侵略任何国家的意图。这一点，前美国驻苏大使凯南也公开指明：“苏联从未以武力侵犯过别国。”他在最近英国电视座谈节目中，又进一步援引了战后以来的事实，证明苏联从来没有进攻过其他国家。那么，“盖瑟委员会”所大吹大擂的美国处在“危险”之中，究竟来自何处呢？
    如果说，美国真正有什么危险的话，那倒不是来自苏联，而是来自“盖瑟委员会”的庞大扩军计划，来自那种“发动先发制人的战争”的观点。
    不是吗？以“盖瑟委员会”的委员为核心，建立了“警号小组”，这个小组的使命，就是天天散布苏联威胁的神话，使美国天天处于“经常不安”的状态，用战争宣传恐吓人民，要他们“流血、流泪、流汗”，借以使愿意照这个计划办事的艾森豪威尔，毋须再“不安地担心美国人民会拒绝付这笔钱”。
    不是吗？“盖瑟委员会”的战争计划，带来的将不是停止冷战和裁减军备，而是疯狂的军备竞赛，导向新的战争。疯狂的扩军计划，将会耗竭美国的经济，榨尽人民的血汗，陷人民生活于困境；那种“先发制人”的好战观点，将会使美国引火烧身，首先遭到原子战争毁灭性的回击。
    这些才是对美国安全的真正威胁呢！
    是为“盖瑟委员会”的战争叫嚣所吓倒，走向新的扩军备战的死路呢？还是接受苏联的和平倡议，化干戈为玉帛呢？美国人民和他们有理智的政治家们是会善自抉择的。
