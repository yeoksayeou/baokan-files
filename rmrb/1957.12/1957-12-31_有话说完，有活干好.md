    “Speak Your Mind, Do Your Job Well”
    In the current rectification of the communes, many people subjectively want to improve the communes and boost production as quickly as possible. How to do it? There are two approaches. One is the approach taken by many agricultural cooperatives in the Bengbu area: "Debate everything, debate everything we do." When agricultural cooperatives wanted to build water conservancy projects, the masses were not very enthusiastic and wanted to engage in sideline production to earn cash. So, they let everyone debate whether or not to build large-scale water conservancy projects. As a result of the debate, the masses recognized the benefits of building water conservancy projects for themselves, felt happy, and their enthusiasm for building water conservancy projects soared, achieving "speak your mind, do your job well." This both rectified the commune and promoted production.
    There is also another approach. Some local comrades do not believe in the benefits of large-scale debates, do not understand that debate is a good way to mobilize the masses, raise awareness, and promote work. They are either afraid that discussion by the masses will waste time, or they are afraid that letting the masses speak out and debate will cause chaos and affect the completion of tasks. Therefore, they casually adopt simple methods to deal with the situation. The result of doing so is often "more haste, less speed." Not only can they not do the job well, but they even make it worse.
    The experience of Bengbu area in rectifying communes clearly tells us a good method of rectifying communes: boldly mobilize the masses to speak out and debate, debate everything we do. This is the best working method to educate the masses to use socialist democracy, to hand over the Party's policies to the masses, and to follow the mass line.
    Of course, mobilizing the masses to speak out and debate, "debate everything," is originally intended to enable the masses to express what they care about most and to solve the most pressing problems. Therefore, leaders should be good at seizing these demands of the masses to conduct debates, and should not debate aimlessly.

### “有话说完，有活干好”

    “有话说完，有活干好”
    在当前整社工作中许多人主观上都想快些把社整好，把生产搞得更好。怎么办？有两种办法。一种是蚌埠专区许多农业社的办法，“有什么辩什么，做什么辩什么”。农业社要修水利，群众不大积极，想去搞副业赚现钱，他们就让大家辩论要不要大兴水利？辩的结果，群众认清了修水利对自己的好处，心情舒畅，兴修水利积极性高涨，做到了“有话说完，有活干好”。既整顿了社，也推动了生产。
    也还有另外一种办法。有些地方的工作同志，他们不大相信大辩论的好处，不理解辩论是发动群众、提高思想、推动工作的好办法，他们或者是害怕交给群众讨论会浪费时间；或者是怕让群众鸣放辩论会搞乱了，影响任务的完成；于是便随便采用简单的办法来处理。而这样作的结果，往往是“欲速不达”，不但不能把工作做好，甚至弄得更糟。
    蚌埠专区整社的经验明确告诉我们一种好的整社方法：放手发动群众鸣放辩论，做什么辩什么。这是教育群众运用社会主义民主，把党的方针政策交给群众，走群众路线的最好的工作方法。
    当然，发动群众鸣放辩论，“有什么辩什么”，原是为了使群众能把自己最关心的事说出来，最迫切的问题解决好。因此，领导者要善于抓住群众这些要求进行辩论，不能漫无目的地瞎辩一气。
