Xinhua News Agency report: In the past month, farmers in mountainous areas of Shaanxi Province have planted more than 500,000 mu of trees. Encouraged by the National Program for Agricultural Development, many mountain farmers, after debate, have put forward the fighting slogan of greening the mountains in one or two years. By November 22, Yulin Prefecture had completed its afforestation task of 230,000 mu. Farmers in Qingjian, Wubu, and Jingbian counties have already exceeded their autumn afforestation plans for this year.

This year, all regions have trained a large number of afforestation technicians. The head of the Yulin County Afforestation Bureau led 19 cadres to the desert areas along the Great Wall to organize and lead farmers in afforestation. The farmers overcame the drought by dipping seedlings in mud and carrying water for irrigation. Yulin, Jingbian, Hengshan and other places have organized many youth afforestation shock brigades. The seven-member youth afforestation shock brigade organized by the Yongfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Jingbian County led more than 80 members of the cooperative to complete more than 330 mu of afforestation in three days. The 23 afforestation shock brigades composed of more than 890 young people in Suide County adopted irrigation planting methods, and the survival rate of planted apricots, walnuts, grapes, and mulberry trees was very high. Fusu Mountain, Zhonglou Mountain, and the banks of the Wuding River in Suide County have been planted with saplings. In addition, more than 1,900 mu of old forests have been replanted, 100,000 scattered trees have been planted, and more than 9,000 mu of young forest tending tasks have been completed. In the afforestation effort, more than 300 forest protection groups were also reorganized. In Hanyin County, more than 5,000 cadres and students went to the countryside and mountains to help farmers with afforestation. In less than a month, the county planted more than 200,000 trees, most of which were economic forests, such as eucommia and pepper. In order to green the small barren mountains and bald ridges on Mount Hua, members of the six agricultural cooperatives such as Xiren and Huafeng in Hua County selected more than 60 experienced members who braved the cold and overcame all difficulties. After three days of intensive labor, they afforested more than 400 mu of land on the mountain.

Xinhua News Agency report: Due to large-scale afforestation in recent years, Guangning County, Guangdong Province, with its overlapping mountains, has changed the face of the mountainous area.

Mountains account for 87% of the total area of this county. From 1951 to the present, farmers in the county have reclaimed and afforested more than 450,000 mu, reorganized and replanted 190,000 mu of residual forests. Together with the original forest land, the county now has a total forest area of more than 2.65 million mu, and more than 97% of the mountains suitable for afforestation are lush and green. The thousands of mountains and ridges are now full of dark green pines and firs and light green bamboo forests. In the past, whenever there was a heavy rain, mountain floods would break out everywhere in the county, mountain slopes would collapse, and crops would be severely damaged. Sometimes mountain floods would carry mud and sand to cover large areas of farmland, and mountain floods would flood into towns. However, during the heavy rains in April and May this year, the county was basically not damaged by mountain floods.

The rapid development of forestry production in recent years has also greatly increased the income of farmers in the county. This year, the total income of forestry and sideline products in the county is expected to reach 22 million yuan. Calculated on the basis of the county's population, each person has about 80 yuan. Adding agricultural income, each person has more than 120 yuan.

The mass afforestation movement in this county has gradually formed with the development of cooperativization. In the past two years, after the autumn harvest, members of agricultural cooperatives have climbed mountains and crossed ridges, going out early and returning late to collect forest seeds and carry out large-scale seedling cultivation and afforestation. In the cold weather of the twelfth lunar month in the past two years, members of more than 20 cooperatives in Kengkou District, fearing no difficulties, went deep into the mountains to collect seeds, overfulfilling the seed collection task. In the past few years, in order to protect forests and prevent fires, farmers in the county have opened firebreaks crisscrossing countless mountain ridges, regardless of snow, frost, wind, or rain. Last year and this year alone, more than 31,000 li of firebreaks were opened, with a total of more than 250,000 laborers participating. Now, the county has basically eliminated forest fires and has been rated by the province as a county without forest fires. During the busy summer planting season this year, bamboo forest pests were prevalent. Farmers in the county carried out summer cultivation and planting on the one hand, and extracted labor to rush to eliminate insects in the mountains on the other.

    陕西山区农民提出战斗口号
　　一两年内绿化山区
    广东广宁县山区基本绿化
    新华社讯　陕西全省山区农民在最近一个月来已经植树造林五十多万亩。许多山区农民在全国农业发展纲要的鼓舞下，经过辩论，提出了在一两年内绿化山区的战斗口号。榆林专区到11月22日已完成造林二十三万亩的任务。清涧、吴堡、靖边三县的农民已经超额完成今年秋季的植树造林计划。
    今年各地都训练了大批植树造林的技术人员。榆林县造林局的负责人率领十九个干部，分别到长城沿线的沙漠地带，组织和领导农民植树造林。农民们以泥浆浸苗（树苗根粘些泥浆）和担水灌溉等办法战胜了天旱。榆林、靖边、横山等地组织了许多青年造林突击队。靖边县永丰农业社组织的七人青年造林突击队带动该社八十多人以三天时间完成了三百三十多亩的造林任务。绥德县由八百九十多个青年组成的二十三个植树造林突击队，采用灌水栽植的办法，栽植的杏树、核桃、葡萄和桑树等成活率都很高。绥德县的扶苏山、钟楼山和无定河岸已栽满树苗，另外还补植旧林一千九百多亩，零星植树十万株，幼林抚育任务完成九千多亩。在植树造林中还整顿护林小组三百多个。汉阴县有五千多名干部、学生下乡上山帮助农民造林，不到一个月，全县就植树二十多万株，其中绝大部分是经济林，如杜仲、花椒等。华县西壬、华峰等六个农业社的社员为了绿化华山上的小片荒山秃岭，选出六十多个有经验的社员冒着寒冷，克服一切艰难困苦，经过三天紧张劳动，在山上造林四百多亩。
    新华社讯　山峦重叠的广东广宁县，由于连年大规模造林，改变了山区面貌。
    这个县的山地占总面积87％。从1951年起到现在，全县农民共开荒造林四十五万多亩，整理补植残林十九万亩，加上原有林地，现在全县共有森林面积二百六十五万多亩，97％以上宜于造林的山地都是一片青葱翠绿。现在的千山万岭，尽是墨绿的松杉和嫩绿的竹林。过去每逢下过大雨，县里便到处山洪暴发，山岗崩塌，农作物受到严重损害。有时山洪带着泥沙堆盖了大片农田，山洪漫进城镇。但是，今年4、5月间，暴雨持续很久，全县基本上没有受到山洪的损害。
    几年来林业生产的迅速发展，也使全县农民的收入大大增加。今年，这个县林副业品的总收入预计可达二千二百万元，按全县人口平均计算，每人就有八十元左右，再加农业收入，每人有一百二十元以上。
    这个县的群众性造林运动是随着合作化的发展逐步形成的，近两年来，农业社社员们在秋收后便登山涉岭，早出晚归，采集林木种子，进行大规模育苗造林。坑口区二十多个合作社的社员们，在近两年腊月寒天，不怕艰难，深入大山采种，超额完成采种任务。几年来全县农民为了护林防火，不管下雪降霜，刮风下雨，在无数高山的脊梁上，开出了纵横交错的防火线道。仅去年和今年就开辟了共三万一千多里长的防火线，参加的劳动力共达二十五万多人次。现在，全县已基本上消灭了山林火灾，被省里评为无森林火灾县。今年夏种大忙时，竹林虫害盛发，全县农民一面进行夏耕夏种，一面抽出劳动力到山里去突击除虫。
