Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 8th - U.S. Vice President Nixon stated in New York on the 6th that the failure of the U.S. to launch its four-pound experimental earth satellite "disappointed him." He said that the U.S. "is now behind in satellites."

In addition to disappointment and frustration, American officials are blaming each other and arguing endlessly about the failure of the satellite launch and the heavy blow to the reputation of the United States. Senator John Stennis, Vice Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee, wrote to Defense Secretary McElroy, accusing him that the failure of the satellite launch had a "very unfortunate" impact on Americans. He said: The natural reaction of Americans is "doubt and unease."

Some Department of Defense officials involved in the satellite launch work have been blamed by members of Congress, who said that due to the hype, the United States has greatly failed in the propaganda war in front of the whole world. One of the accused Department of Defense officials, Assistant Secretary of Defense Murray Snyder, attempted to blame the failure on news reporters and the terrain of the test launch site at Cape Canaveral. He complained that reporters had published the launch date long ago and complained that two hundred reporters reported what they saw around the "fishbowl"-shaped launch site.

The "New York Herald Tribune" pointed out in an editorial titled "The Crash of the Dunces" with extreme dissatisfaction: "When this long-delayed satellite exploded directly in front of its inventors, Americans were really caught between laughter and tears -- crying because of this lamentable national humiliation; laughing because of this unimaginable absurdity." It said that it was already very undignified to have failed to launch a satellite for so long; it was even more unforgivable to fail in front of everyone, in front of television cameras and radio broadcasters.

　　美国人被弄得啼笑皆非
　　可哭的是这种令人难堪的耻辱
    可笑的是这种难以想像的荒唐
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：美国副总统尼克松6日在纽约表示，美国四磅重的第一颗试验性地球卫星发射失败，“使他感到失望”。他说，美国“在卫星方面现在是落后了”。
    在失望和沮丧之余，美国官场人物对卫星发射的失败及其对美国声誉的沉重打击互相推诿责任，争吵不休。参议院军备小组委员会副主席约翰·史坦尼斯写信给国防部长麦克艾罗伊，提出指责说，卫星发射失败对美国人有“十分不幸”的影响。他说：美国人的自然的反应是“怀疑和不安”。
    一些同负责发射卫星工作有关的国防部官员受到了议员们的指责，这些议员们说，由于大吹大擂，美国这次在全世界眼前使自己在宣传战线上大大失败。受到指责的国防部官员之一——助理国防部长墨莱·斯奈德企图把这次失败归咎于新闻记者和卡纳维拉尔角的试验发射场的地形，他抱怨记者们老早就发表了发射的日期，还抱怨二百名记者把他们在“金鱼碗”形的发射场地周围看到的情况报道出去。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”在题为“笨蛋的坠毁”的一篇社论里极其不满地指出：“当这颗姗姗来迟的卫星直接在它的发明家面前炸毁的时候，美国人真是啼笑皆非了——哭的是这种令人难堪的民族耻辱；笑的是这种难以想像的荒唐。”它说，迟迟发射不出卫星本来已经是非常不体面了；而当着大家的面，在电视摄录机和无线电播音器面前遭到失败，就更加不可原谅。
