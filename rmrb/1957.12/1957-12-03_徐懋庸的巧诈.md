    Xu Maoyong's essay "Honesty and Cleverness" (see page 8 of this newspaper on February 23rd, under the pen name "Fu Xian") seems to be discussing philosophy at the beginning, quoting Engels and Lenin, and constantly using terms like "materialism" and "dialectics." But the more you read, the more you realize that he is not actually discussing any philosophical issues, but is "criticizing" our society and attacking our Party.
    Anyone who has read a little philosophy will see that Xu Maoyong's word games with philosophical terms are nothing more than a caricature and burlesque of the scientific worldview and dialectical materialism. It's truly shameless of him to call himself a true Marxist and accuse others of being fake Marxists.
    However, it would be too naive to really think he is writing a philosophical article. The reason he spends so much ink, using the majority of the space, to play tricks with philosophical terms is simply to bring out the main point at the end. Circling around, revealing the dagger at the end of the road, Xu Maoyong is truly a master of attacking from the shadows!
    He uses ancient stories to allude to the present, telling a story of a feudal ruler who trusted "cunning" officials and alienated "clumsy but honest" officials, to insinuate that our society today is not much different from the past, and to insinuate that under the leadership of the Communist Party and the people's regime, leaders at all levels cannot get rid of this old-fashioned style of the old society in their treatment of the led. He slanderously says that within the Communist Party, in the organs of the people's regime, superiors still listen only to one side, and subordinates lie and flatter; superiors are "leaders who only like others to cater to them," and subordinates are cadres who "disregard facts and cater to" leaders; in the new society, it is still the "cunning" who prosper and the "clumsy but honest" who suffer.
    Of course, the new society did not fall from the sky, and it cannot but carry the remnants of the old society. There are still bad people and bad things in the new society, so we must carry out rectification and improve our work. However, no one can deny that there is an essential difference between the new society and the old society. The foundation of the new society is different, and its superstructure has also changed. The laws, systems, morality, and customs of the new society are incompatible with so-called "cunning." There may still be "cunning," but it is destined to be ineffective and will be exposed, criticized, and punished. To say that in a socialist system, the wicked still prevail and the good are bullied is nothing short of distorting the truth and harboring ulterior motives.
    However, Xu Maoyong, who has lost the Party's stance and the people's stance, is so hostile to socialist society that he insists on confusing the essentially different new and old societies, as if the socialist system itself can produce things that are opposed to it. Xu Maoyong, who was disciplined by the Party for making serious mistakes, probably compares himself to Qu Yuan, as Sima Qian said, "Qu Ping grieved that the king's hearing was not clear, that slanderous and flattering words obscured his vision, that evil and crooked ways harmed the public interest, and that the upright and honest were not tolerated," so Xu Maoyong "felt compelled to speak out" and vehemently denounced that "the upper beam is not straight and the lower beam is crooked." The Communist Party is almost the same as a fatuous and tyrannical ruler who trusts petty men and persecutes loyal and good people! Isn't this too much? Is this just a matter of a slightly incorrect way of thinking, a little one-sided?
    According to Xu Maoyong himself, he is an ardent admirer of "clumsy honesty" and a staunch opponent of "cunning." He compares himself to a "clumsy but honest" person, describing himself as "honest," "not telling lies," "but speaking out directly regardless of time, place, and conditions," so "he has a negative impact on the environment, and he himself has been rebuffed… but the basic quality is good." This is his self-praise and self-deception. He clearly made serious mistakes and was disciplined by the Party, but he still says that he was rebuffed because he spoke frankly; he clearly harbors resentment against the Party and is determined to attack the Party and slander socialism, but he still pretends to be discussing philosophical issues, babbling about how honesty is materialism and cleverness is dialectics. The rightist Xu Maoyong is truly the most dishonest and cunning person.

    徐懋庸的巧诈
    山柏
    徐懋庸的杂文“老实和聪明”（见2月23日本报八版，笔名弗先）开头似乎是在谈哲学，引用了恩格斯和列宁，“唯物”“辩证”不离其口。但是越看到后面，就越觉得他实际上并不是在讨论什么哲学问题，而是在“批判”我们的社会，攻击我们的党。
    谁要是读过一点儿哲学，谁就会看出来，徐懋庸玩弄哲学名词的文字游戏，不过是对科学的世界观、辩证唯物主义的漫画化和滑稽化。真亏他不害臊地还要自许为真马克思主义者，而骂别人是假马克思主义者。
    但是，如果当真以为他是在做哲学文章，那真是太老实了。他所以要花许多笔墨，用大部分的篇幅，来耍弄哲学名词的魔术，其目的无非要引出尾巴上的一点儿本文来。曲折隐晦，图穷匕现，徐懋庸可真是个暗箭伤人的能手！
    他借古喻今，讲了一个封建统治者信赖“巧诈”的官吏、疏远“拙诚”的官吏的故事，来影射我们今天的社会也跟过去的差不多，影射在共产党领导的人民政权下，各级领导对待被领导，也脱不掉这套旧社会的旧风气。他诬蔑地说，在共产党内，在人民政权机关里，还是上级偏听偏信，下级说谎拍马，上级是“一味喜欢别人迎合的领导者”，下级是“不顾事实、一味迎合”领导者的干部；在新社会，依旧是“巧诈”的发迹，“拙诚”的倒楣。
    当然，新社会不是从天上掉下来的，它不可能不带有旧社会的残余，新社会里也还是有坏人坏事，因此，我们要整风，改进工作。但是，谁也不能否认，新社会和旧社会是有本质的差别的。新社会的基础不同了，它的上层建筑也改变了。新社会的法律、制度、道德、风尚和所谓“巧诈”是不相容的。可能还有“巧诈”，但这是注定了吃不开的，要受到揭露、批判和制裁的。说在社会主义制度下，还是恶人当道，好人受欺，不能不说是颠倒黑白，别有用心。
    但是，丧失了党的立场、人民的立场的徐懋庸是这样的敌视社会主义社会，他硬要把本质上不同的新旧社会混为一谈，仿佛社会主义制度本身也能够产生和它相对立的东西。由于犯了严重错误而受党处分的徐懋庸，大概自比于屈原吧，像司马迁所说的，“屈平疾王听之不聪也，谗谄之蔽明也，邪曲之害公也，方正之不容也”，所以徐懋庸就“有感而发”，大骂其“上梁不正下梁歪”起来了。共产党竟和亲信小人、残害忠良的无道昏君差不多！这不是太过分了吗？这难道还只是什么思想方法不大对头，有点儿片面吗？
    据徐懋庸自己说，他是“拙诚”的热烈赞扬者，“巧诈”的竭力反对者。他自比于“拙诚”者，把自己描写为“老实”，“不说假话”，“但不问时间、地点和条件，无保留地直说出来”，所以“对环境发生不良影响，而自己则碰了钉子……但基本的品质是好的”。这是他的自夸自赞，也是自欺欺人。他明明是犯了严重错误，受了党的处分，却还要说是由于说了直话，才碰了钉子；他明明是对党怀恨，下定决心要攻击党，诽谤社会主义，却还要装作是在谈哲学问题，胡扯什么老实就是唯物，聪明就是辩证。右派分子徐懋庸真是个最不老实的巧诈者了。
