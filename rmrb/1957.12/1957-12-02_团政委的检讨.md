    The Political Commissar's Self-Criticism
    "I have an opinion about our regiment's political commissar! One day, I saw him walking down the street smoking a cigarette. This will damage military discipline and have a very bad impact!" A new soldier spoke first at the democratic meeting.
    As soon as he finished speaking, the meeting place buzzed with discussion. Everyone thought his opinion was incorrect because the regimental political commissar never smoked at all.
    But, unexpectedly, the regimental political commissar spoke, and he made a self-criticism:
    "The opinion of a comrade that I was smoking in the street has given me great help. I do not smoke. The fact that this comrade said I was smoking in the street shows that he does not yet know me, which precisely demonstrates that I have bureaucracy and have not yet integrated with the soldiers. I am determined to correct this shortcoming well."

    团政委的检讨
    “我对咱们团政委有意见！有一天，我看见他在街上一边走一边吸香烟，这会破坏军风纪，影响很不好！”一个新战士在民主大会上首先发言。
    他的话刚讲完，会场上就闹哄哄地讲开了。大家都认为他的意见不正确，因为团政委根本就不会吸烟。
    可是，没想到团政委开了口，他作了检讨：
    “有位同志说我在街上抽烟的意见，给了我很大的帮助。我是不吸烟的。这位同志说我在街上吸烟，说明他还不认识我，这正说明我有官僚主义，还没有和士兵打成一片。我决心很好地改正这个毛病。”
        （广州驻军某部政治部　姚小微）
