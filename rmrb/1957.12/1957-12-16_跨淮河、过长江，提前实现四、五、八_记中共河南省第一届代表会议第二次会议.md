　　"Across the Huai River, Over the Yangtze River, Achieve 'Four, Five, Eight' Ahead of Schedule"
　　--A Record of the Second Meeting of the First Congress of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
　　By Our Correspondent Wang Changlong
　　"Achieve 'Four, Five, Eight' ahead of schedule, cross the Huai River, and cross the Yangtze River" is a resounding slogan put forward in the resolution unanimously passed by the 882 representatives at the Second Meeting of the First Congress of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China.

　　Look at the Pioneers

　　Is it possible to achieve the grain yield targets of 400, 500, and 800 jin stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program in different regions of Henan Province? The representatives had a sharp and intense debate around this issue. The compelling basis for the victors in the debate was: it has only been two years since agricultural cooperativization was basically realized in the province; Meng County and the suburbs of Anyang City north of the Yellow River, and 1,556 agricultural cooperatives distributed throughout the province, have reached and exceeded the "Four, Five, Eight" targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program, ten years ahead of schedule; and 11 counties and cities including Huojia, Xinxiang, Anyang, and the suburbs of Anyang City, and 3,682 agricultural cooperatives, have achieved average per-mu yields of ginned cotton of 40, 60, 80, and over 100 jin, respectively. Among the 1,556 cooperatives that reached and exceeded the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program ten years ahead of schedule in terms of grain yield, 250 cooperatives were in the area north of the Yellow River (with grain yields reaching and exceeding 400 jin per mu), 1,272 cooperatives were in the area south of the Yellow River and north of the Huai River (with grain yields reaching and exceeding 500 jin per mu), and 34 cooperatives were in the area south of the Huai River (with grain yields reaching and exceeding 800 jin per mu).

　　What did these glorious pioneers rely on to achieve the production increase targets of the Forty Articles ten years ahead of schedule? Some of them are in the plains, some in the deep mountains; some in low-lying, flood-prone areas, some in sandy wasteland areas; some in areas with more land and fewer people, some in areas with less land and more people. They appear not only in areas with low yields in the past but also in areas with continuous yield increases. Their common characteristics are: relying on the collective strength of agricultural cooperatives, mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of members, boosting a surge of energy, overcoming natural disasters, vigorously developing water conservancy, accumulating large amounts of fertilizer, and actively promoting a great leap forward in agricultural production after reforming farming techniques according to local conditions. Dengcheng Township in Shangcheng County is located in a low-lying area and has suffered from natural disasters throughout the years, resulting in extremely unstable grain yields. However, this township summarized the lessons of low yields and years of disasters, mobilized the members of six agricultural cooperatives, and vigorously improved the soil this spring, planting high-yield crops, so that more than 21,000 mu of farmland averaged 527 jin of grain per mu. Laomen Agricultural Cooperative in Jigongshan Township, Xinyang County, is located in a deep mountainous area with undulating mountains, and yields have not been high over the years. However, after the Party branch mobilized the members to build terraces and increase fertilizer application, 368 mu of farmland achieved an average yield of 1,182 jin per mu. There are many, many similar examples. These vivid facts make the argument of "more land but less labor, deep plowing and meticulous cultivation are impossible, and increasing production is difficult" in areas with more land and fewer people, the argument of "it is difficult to harvest 100 shi without planting 100 mu, and it is impossible no matter what without that much land" in areas with less land and more people, the argument of "disasters every year, no matter how hard we work, we are afraid of losing everything to a flood" in low-lying areas, the argument of "little soil and lack of water, no way to increase production" in mountainous areas, and the argument of "we have nine ridges and eighteen depressions here, cannot be water conservancy, no way to increase production" in sandy areas, etc., all lose their basis. The representatives unanimously agreed that waiting for God's grace, without a surge of energy, not daring to overcome difficulties, transform nature, and utilize nature, is an obstacle on the road to increasing production and a right-leaning conservative ideology in agricultural production.

　　Must Have a Surge of Energy

　　What kind of spirit should be used to formulate future agricultural development targets? This was also an issue that everyone debated enthusiastically at the Party Congress. Some representatives from the Kaifeng area advocated setting the production increase targets lower and proposing more stable measures, only gradually advancing and not leaping forward. However, Zhao Tianxi, a representative from the Xuchang area, disagreed with this slow approach. He strongly advocated that production increase measures should ensure a leap forward in production. He said: "Based on past experience, it is better to organize a massive effort for anything that needs to be done and can be done. Only a massive effort can mobilize the entire Party and go all out, and only then can we do more and do better." People also cited the experience gained from the high tide of cooperativization. After the high tide of cooperativization appeared, some people with right-leaning thoughts doubted the practice of large-scale development of cooperativization and advocated taking it slowly. However, the facts of the past two years have proven that haven't millions of cooperatives across the province, under the severe conditions of natural disasters, demonstrated the superiority of agricultural cooperatives and overcome disasters and increased production? Haven't cooperatives been basically consolidated throughout the province? People also studied the experience of those agricultural cooperatives that have made a leap forward in production and realized that these cooperatives have all achieved a leap forward on the basis of adapting to local conditions, making overall plans, and vigorously implementing key measures. Wangwu Township in Jiyuan County is located in a barren, high mountainous area 800 meters above sea level with a lack of water resources, "steep slopes and high mountains, thin soil and small plots, strong winds all year round, hailstorms in two seasons out of three, no water to irrigate when drought, soil washed away when flooded, planting crops every year, growing poorly every season." However, after cooperativization, the people there proposed the slogan "The Foolish Old Man could move mountains in the past, we can realize water conservancy in this generation." From March last year to this spring, they overcame various difficulties to build five reservoirs, open 20 canals, dig 594 water cellars, and drill 124 wells, finally turning more than 7,500 mu of rain-fed mountain land into irrigated land and spot-planting land. As a result, this township saw the miracle of water conservancy in high mountains and double-thousand-jin per-mu yields. After this example was introduced by the Jiyuan County representatives at the congress, it aroused unanimous exclamations from the representatives: Is there any place with worse natural conditions than Wangwu Township? They have the determination to work hard, so production has leaped forward. Why don't we dare to work hard and dare to leap forward?

　　Rely on the Masses

　　Having the drive to work hard, how to do it? This has become another topic of debate among the representatives. Some representatives believe that: to build farmland water conservancy, we need to do projects, and since we are doing projects, the state needs to provide money. But other representatives do not recognize it this way. Wang Wanxuan from Xixia County advocated mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and running water conservancy diligently and thriftily. He introduced the experience of Sheweigou Township in running water conservancy diligently and thriftily. Sheweigou Township is a deep mountainous area with many mountains and ravines, narrow land, and barrenness. The township has 3,125 mu of cultivated land, of which only 410 mu are irrigated land, accounting for 13% of the total cultivated area. After cooperativization, the Party branch proposed the slogan "March towards water conservancy," and after fully mobilizing the masses, opened canals, dug springs, drilled wells, built dams, repaired ponds, built gully dikes and other small water conservancy projects, expanding the township's irrigated land to 2,890 mu, accounting for 91% of the total cultivated area, leaping to become a water conservancy township. In the process of building water conservancy, this township, in addition to spending money on buying waterwheels, used all self-made stones for the materials used in drilling wells, building dams, and other projects. None of the 41 wells had a single brick (using stone instead of brick). In the pond construction project, all 120,000 jin of lime used were burned by the masses themselves. Three canals of the first and third cooperatives were separated by mountain gullies dozens of feet deep. The members dug tree trunks into wooden troughs, used bamboo poles to connect them, and erected them in the middle of the gullies to divert water to the opposite bank. The second cooperative had to divert river water over a stone mountain to raise the water to the hillside half a li high to irrigate 32 mu. This arduous project only cost five jiao for dynamite. After the representatives heard this experience, they became more clear about the direction of mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses to organize a great leap forward in agricultural production. People who had previously emphasized the need for state investment in their speeches also felt that they had underestimated the masses' demands for increased production and unlimited power after cooperativization, and underestimated the favorable conditions and potential for increasing production.

　　Consensus in Understanding

　　With the issues debated and clarified, there is a surge of energy. During the conference, Zhou Bingtan and ten other representatives from Dengfeng County wrote an eye-catching big-character poster. The title was: "Dengfeng County Wants to Cross the Huai River and Cross the Yangtze River." The main contents are: the county's per-mu grain yield should reach 800 jin within ten years, 400 jin per mu next year, and 600 jin per mu in 1962; the procurement task next year should exceed this year's by one time. Guarantee to do what is said, no empty talk. The conditions are: (1) Basic realization of water conservancy throughout the county in 1962. (2) Close mountains for afforestation and greening barren hills to conserve water and soil, and repair terraced fields. (3) Vigorously develop cattle herds, sheep herds, and pig herds to accumulate large amounts of fertilizer. (4) Request the Provincial Party Committee to strengthen specific leadership, and the Prefectural Party Committee to provide specific assistance, to ensure that the state does not spend money. The representatives from various regions, according to the characteristics of their regions, sought potential for increasing production in accordance with local conditions, and formulated and revised measures for a great leap forward in production. Now the Henan Provincial Party Congress has ended, and the representatives are conveying the magnificent action slogan of "Achieve 'Four, Five, Eight' ahead of schedule, cross the Huai River, and cross the Yangtze River!" to the entire Party and the people of the entire province.

　　“跨淮河、过长江，提前实现四、五、八”
　　——记中共河南省第一届代表会议第二次会议
　　本报记者　王昌隆
    “提前实现四、五、八，跨淮河，过长江”，是中共河南省第一届代表会议第二次会议上的八百八十二位代表一致举手通过的决议里提出的响亮口号。
    看看先行者
    在河南省不同地区分别实现全国农业发展纲要所规定四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的粮食产量指标是否可能呢？代表们曾经围绕这一问题展开尖锐、剧烈的辩论。而在辩论中得胜者的有力根据是：全省基本上实现了农业合作化才两年，黄河以北的孟县、安阳市郊和分布在全省的一千五百五十六个农业社，在粮食产量上，提前十年分别达到和超过全国农业发展纲要所规定“四、五、八”的指标；并有获嘉、新乡、安阳、安阳市郊区等十一个县市和三千六百八十二个农业社，皮棉每亩平均产量分别达到四十斤、六十斤、八十斤、一百斤以上。在粮食产量上提前十年达到和超过全国农业发展纲要指标的一千五百五十六个社中，黄河以北地区的有二百五十个社（亩产粮食达到和超过四百斤），黄河以南淮河以北地区有一千二百七十二个社（亩产粮食达到和超过五百斤），淮河以南地区有三十四个社（亩产粮食达到和超过八百斤）。
    这一批光荣的先行者，是靠什么提前十年实现了四十条纲要的增产指标的呢？它们有的在平原，有的在深山；有的在低洼易涝地区，有的在沙荒地区；有的在地多人少地区，有的在地少人多地区。它们不仅出现在过去产量不高的地区，而且出现在连年增产的地区。它们的共同特点是：依靠农业社的集体力量，发动广大社员的积极性创造性，鼓起一股干劲，战胜自然灾害，大兴水利、大量积肥，因地制宜改革耕作技术后，积极推动农业生产大跃进。商城县邓城乡地势低洼，历年来遭受自然灾害，粮食产量是极不稳定的。但这个乡总结了低产和连年受灾的教训，发动六个农业社的社员，今年春上大力改良了土壤，种植了高产作物，使两万一千多亩粮田平均亩产了五百二十七斤粮食。信阳县鸡公山乡老门农业社，地处山峦起伏的深山区，历年产量不高。但经过党支部发动社员广修梯田、增施肥料之后，三百六十八亩粮田，每亩平均单产竟达一千一百八十二斤。类似的事例很多很多。这些活生生的事实，使得地多人少地区的“土地多劳力少，深耕细作不可能，增产有困难”的说法，使得地少人多地区的“不种百亩难打百石，没有那样多的地，怎么也不行”的说法，使得低洼地区的“年年有灾，再干也不行，不怕辛苦种，只怕一水收”的说法，使得山区的“土少水缺，无法增产”的说法；使得沙岗地区的“我们这里九岗十八洼，不能水利化，增产无办法”的说法等等，都失掉了自己的依据。代表们一致认为坐待老天恩赐，没有一股干劲，不敢去战胜困难，改造自然，利用自然，是增产道路上的障碍，是农业生产上的右倾保守思想。
    要有一股劲儿
    应该用怎样的精神制订今后的农业发展指标呢？这也是党代表会议上大家热烈争论的问题。开封地区有的代表主张把增产指标定得低一些，措施提得稳一些，只能渐进不能跃进。而许昌地区的代表赵天锡就不同意这种慢慢来的想法。他极力主张增产措施应该保证生产的跃进。他说：“根据过去的经验看，凡是需要干而又可能干的，还是组织大干好。只有大干才能全党动员，全力以赴，也才能干的多、干的好。”人们还举出从合作化高潮中得到经验。在合作化高潮出现以后，有些有右倾思想的人曾经怀疑合作化大发展的做法，主张慢慢来。可是，两年来的事实证明，全省千百万个合作社在灾荒严重的情况下，不是发挥了农业社的优越性而战胜了灾荒增加了生产吗？合作社不是在全省范围内基本上巩固起来了吗？人们又研究了那些生产跃进的农业社的经验，认识到这些社都是在因地制宜、全面规划的基础上，大力实现了主要措施而后达到了跃进的。济源县王屋乡是拔海八百公尺，缺乏水源的贫瘠高山峻岭地区，“坡陡山高，地薄块小，一年四季刮大风，三年两季下冰雹，旱了没水浇，雨涝土冲跑，年年种庄稼，季季长不好”。但是合作化后，那里的人们提出了“前代愚公能移山，我们这代能实现水利化”的口号。从去年3月到今年春天，战胜各种困难修起了五座水库，开河引渠二十条，打水窖五百九十四个，打水井一百二十四眼，终于使七千五百多亩山旱地变成水浇地和点种地，结果，这个乡就出现了高山水利化和亩产双千斤的奇迹。这个事例经过济源县代表在大会上介绍以后，引起了代表们同声惊叹：那里还有比王屋乡的自然条件更差的呢？他们有决心大干，使得生产跃进了，我们为啥就不敢大干，不敢跃进呢？
    依靠群众
    干的劲头有了，而怎样干？这又成了代表们争论的一个题目。有的代表认为：兴修农田水利，就要做工程，既做工程，就需要国家拿钱来。但也有的代表不是这样认识的。西峡县王万选主张，发动群众、依靠群众，勤俭办水利。他介绍了蛇尾沟乡勤俭办水利的经验。蛇尾沟乡是一个山大沟多、土地窄小，而又瘠薄的深山区。全乡耕地三千一百二十五亩，耕地中仅有水地四百一十亩，占总耕地面积13％。合作化后，党支部提出“向水利化进军”的口号，经过充分发动群众，开渠，挖泉，打井，修堰坝，修水塘，筑谷坊等小型水利工程，使全乡水地扩大到二千八百九十亩，占总耕地面积的91％，一跃而为水利化的乡。而这个乡在兴办水利中，除了买水车花钱以外，在打井、修堰坝等工程上，所用的物料全是自己打的石头，四十一眼井没有一块砖（以石代砖）。在修塘工程上，所用的十二万斤石灰，全是群众自己烧的。一社和三社有三条渠被数十丈深的山沟隔断，社员们用树干挖成木槽，用竹杆打通，架在沟中间，把水引到对岸。第二社要把河水引过一个石山，使水升到半里高的山腰中浇三十二亩，这样艰巨的工程，也只花了炸药钱五角。代表们听了这一经验，对于发动群众、依靠群众组织农业生产大跃进的方向更加明确了。原来在发言中强调要国家投资的人，也觉得自己原来还是对合作化后群众的增产要求和无限力量认识不足，对增加生产的有利条件和潜力认识不足。
    认识上的一致
    问题争论明，有了一股劲儿。在会议进行过程中，登封县的周炳坦等十一位代表写了一张引人注意的大字报。题目是：“登封县要跨淮河，过长江。”主要内容是：十年之内全县亩产粮食达到八百斤，明年亩产四百斤，1962年亩产六百斤；明年统购任务要超过今年的一倍。保证说到办到，不放空炮。条件是：（一）1962年全县基本实现水利化。（二）封山育林绿化荒山，保持水土，整修梯田。（三）大力发展牛群、羊群、猪群，大量积肥。（四）要求省委加强具体领导，地委具体帮助，保证不让国家出钱。各地区的代表按照本地区的特点，因地制宜地找增产潜力，并分别制定和修订了增产大跃进的措施。现在河南省的党代表会议已经结束，代表们正在把“提前实现四、五、八，跨淮河，过长江！”的雄伟行动口号，传达给全党和全省人民。
