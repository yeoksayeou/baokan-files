    Shanghai Vigorously Eliminates Mosquitoes and Flies
    The Shanghai Patriotic Health Campaign Committee made arrangements as early as the beginning of November for the task of eliminating overwintering mosquitoes and flies this winter and spring. According to the living habits of mosquitoes and flies, a three-stage control method was adopted: the first stage was to thoroughly kill maggots in the breeding grounds of flies to prevent them from becoming pupae; using 666 smoke and organizing capture and beatings with specific targets and focuses to prevent adult mosquitoes from overwintering. The second stage was to organize the masses to dig up pupae, extensively clear standing water, fill holes, and seal openings to prevent flies from growing and mosquitoes from appearing. The final stage was to eliminate newly emerging mosquitoes and flies and the first generation of fly maggots and mosquito larvae. At present, the work of eliminating overwintering mosquitoes and flies has been widely carried out in various districts of Shanghai. Drugs have been carefully applied to kill maggots in many fly breeding grounds and manure tanks. In the basements of 164 buildings in five districts, 666 smoke has been widely used to kill mosquitoes, with good results. In addition, the city has also carried out pilot work on collective poisoning of domestic rats in eleven street offices and 120 neighborhood committees, covering approximately 50,000 residents in densely populated areas such as Huangpu District, having poisoned more than 12,700 rats. This experience will be summarized and promoted.

    上海大力消灭蚊蝇
    上海市爱国卫生运动委员会早在11月初，就布置了今冬明春消灭过冬蚊蝇的任务。根据蚊蝇生活特点，采取了三段控制法：前期是在苍蝇孳生地进行彻底灭蛆，不使变蛹；有对象有重点地用六六六烟熏和组织捕打，不让成蚊越冬。中期是组织群众挖蛹，广泛清除积水，填洞、封口，不让苍蝇成长，蚊虫出现。后期则是消灭刚出现的蚊蝇和第一代蝇蛆、孑孓。目前，消灭过冬蚊蝇工作已在上海市各区广泛开展，在许多苍蝇孳生地和粪缸认真进行了下药灭蛆，在五个区一百六十四座大楼的地下室，已普遍进行了六六六烟熏灭蚊，收效很好。此外，该市还在黄浦等人口稠密地区的十一个街道办事处，一百二十个居民委员会约五万人口居住的范围内，进行了集体毒杀家鼠的试点工作，已毒杀老鼠一万二千七百多只。这一经验即将于总结后推广。
