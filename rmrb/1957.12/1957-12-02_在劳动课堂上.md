　　In the Labor Classroom
　　Diligent Apprentice
　　Zhou Zhengmin stood opposite her master's lathe. When the master's cutting tool rotated, she quickly poured on the soap water; when the master finished machining a workpiece, she immediately swept away the iron filings. Because of such a good apprentice, Sun Songsheng's face often showed a satisfied smile.
　　Zhou Zhengmin was one of the first batch of cadres from the Suzhou Iron Factory's departments to be sent down to the shop floor. She was very happy after her application to be sent down was approved. She specially took out a notebook that her lover had given her to record her labor diary. She usually liked her long braids that she had kept for more than five years. However, when she learned that long braids were inconvenient when operating in the workshop, she resolutely cut them off. In the office, she took the bus to and from work; after arriving at the workshop, she often walked home after work to strengthen her leg muscles to adapt to the workshop labor. After she arrived at the workshop, she was diligent in tidying up tools, organizing machine tools, and cleaning the workplace; she humbly asked her master for advice on some issues she didn't understand.
　　Her master, Sun Songsheng, also cared for and showed consideration for this diligent apprentice. When the apprentice poured soap water for him, he explained the role of soap water in metal cutting; when changing tools, he explained the transformation method of transverse and longitudinal infeed. When encountering workpieces with a large amount of machining allowance, the master also allowed the apprentice to practically learn the operation. Sun Songsheng was afraid that the apprentice, who had just come out of the office, would not be able to stand eight hours a day, so he taught the apprentice to alternate resting with both feet, and explained: "When a horse is standing, aren't there always two legs bent? That's it resting." After work, when the apprentice wiped the machine tool, the master picked up the broom to sweep the floor. Zhou Zhengmin said, "Master, let me do these chores!" The master said, "We are not ordinary master and apprentice, we should help each other and exchange literary and martial skills."
　　"My Transformation is More Thorough"
　　On the lofting platform of the Shanghai Shipbuilding and Repair Factory, young technician Ni Yichong, who had just arrived at the construction site as a lofting worker, began to change in terms of labor production, living habits, and class consciousness under the cultivation and education of senior master Shen Jindi and others.
　　On Ni Yichong's first day at the construction site, eighth-grade lofting worker Shen Jindi took him up and down the ship to do measurement and sight work. Master Shen's spirit of cultivating the younger generation of workers without fear of hardship greatly moved the young technician. After that, he always strove to do strenuous labor. The work on the lofting platform was to squat on the ground all day to draw lines. In the first few days, his back was sore and he couldn't stand up. However, he saw that Master Shen considered each line again and again in order to draw the lines more accurately and make the ship more beautiful, and drew it again and again, so he insisted on squatting on the lofting platform; after half a month, he, like Master Shen, could squat for half a day without back pain.
　　After working as a worker for half a month, living and working with Master Shen and others, Ni Yichong felt that in his new position, whether in production technology or political thought, there were endless things for him to learn. Every day before work or during breaks after work, he always wrote down what the senior master said, the work he did, and his own experiences in a work diary; the diary he wrote in half a month was more than what he wrote in the eight months he worked as a technician. In the exercise of labor, he not only deeply realized that theory must be combined with practice, but also further realized that workers have a pair of diligent hands, a firm stand, and a smart mind. For example, when lofting a certain bow plate on the Democratic Wheel, the design department's drawings showed the whole plate, but Master Shen suggested that it be split into two pieces for lofting and processing, which could reduce the difficulty of processing for fire workers and save a lot of labor and man-hours. From this incident, Ni Yichong felt that the designers sitting in the office had not participated in physical labor such as marking and fire work, so they did not deeply understand the difficulties below, and their thinking was not as thorough as his master's when designing.
　　Ni Yichong was born into a landlord family. In his short half-month of labor training, he deeply felt that he could only thoroughly transform himself through labor. When another young technician asked him, if I don't become a worker, but go down to work with the workers and become one with them, can I transform myself? He replied that you can also transform your thinking by doing this, but it is impossible to transform yourself thoroughly. Because your identity is assistant section chief, not a worker. When there is a big wind or heavy snow on the construction site, you can go back to the office to bake by the stove, and no one will say anything to you; but if I become a worker, I have to persevere, and my transformation will be more thorough than yours.
　　Steelmaking Girl
　　Beside the steelmaking furnace, a young girl wielded an iron rake, raking slag from the flaming steelmaking furnace. In front of her, there was an old worker helping her. On the surface, she looked no different from the young men. This is Li Shuyuan, the former trainee technician of the Central Laboratory of the Forging and Metallurgy Department of the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory, who volunteered to be sent down to work as a steelmaking worker when the organization was being streamlined.
　　On Li Shuyuan's first day at the steelmaking furnace, she felt a little nervous and was frightened by the large iron rake weighing thirty to forty pounds; she thought: I can't even pick it up, how can I rake slag? Senior master Li Xuejin and Duan Lunyou saw her thoughts and immediately found a lightweight tool for her to use, and also changed the steel plate on the head of the iron rake to wood. At the beginning, the young men laughed at her for using this kind of rake; but now, the entire group uses the same rake as her. Because this kind of rake is not only lightweight and saves steel plate, but also can increase the efficiency of slag raking by nearly one time.
　　Senior master Li Xuejin praised her and said: Although she has been here for a short time, she grabs at every job, is not afraid of getting dirty, is very careful, and can unite with everyone. Some apprentices in the group who were not very active in production in the past have also become active under her influence.
　　Good Member of the Shock Brigade
　　A simple work shed at the Taiyuan Fertilizer Plant construction site recently added two young carpenters. They are Sun Shengjia, the personnel dispatcher of the work area, who was just sent down to the production post, and Wu Chengqing, a graduating student from Zhejiang University.
　　These two new carpenters joined the Shen Miaofa Youth Shock Brigade as soon as they arrived at the construction site. In the past few days, the workers were building a complex structure of a water tower, but the construction was stranded because they could not understand the design drawings. The team members knew that Sun Shengjia had been a carpenter before, and Wu Chengqing studied civil engineering at the university, so they must be able to understand the drawings. Therefore, they recommended that the two of them make a model for the workers according to the drawings. Although they felt a little rusty, they happily accepted the task.
　　This youth shock brigade is one of the most active on the construction site. They go wherever they are needed. Sun Shengjia, along with everyone, makes door frames today and repairs roofs tomorrow. Some time ago, the team members used sorghum stalks to make the roof. He suggested using discarded wood to nail down the scattered sorghum stalks instead of tying them with hemp rope. This can not only prevent the roof from rotting prematurely, but also complete the task by 30% above the quota. The workers all said that he was an excellent carpenter in the youth shock brigade.
　　Athlete Learns to Turn Blanks
　　In the workshops of the Chongqing General Machinery Factory, a group of new workers welcomed by the old workers has recently appeared. From their oil-stained bodies, hands full of calluses, and happy labor expressions, it is difficult to recognize that they are cadres who have graduated from universities and colleges and have been sent down to the workshops not long ago.
　　Shi Changming, who just graduated from the Beijing Petroleum Institute this year, is now an excellent apprentice unanimously praised by the old workers in the metalworking workshop. When he was sent down to the workshop from the department a month ago, he was determined to work hard and transform himself in labor. He always picked up heavy work on the lathe, and did a good job of preparing for life and cleaning the lathe every day, saving his master a lot of effort and time. For example, shaking the handle of the lathe, taking the jack, etc., were previously done by one or two auxiliary workers to help the master, and they still felt strenuous; now Shi Changming takes the initiative to do these clumsy tasks alone, and he shakes the lathe handle with one hand as fast as a windmill. The workers in the workshop all praised his enthusiasm and strength. After inquiring, they learned that he used to be a weightlifter in Beijing. Shi Changming respects his master everywhere and learns business humbly. In more than a month, he has learned to turn blanks.

### 在劳动课堂上

专栏：

　　在劳动课堂上
    手脚勤快的徒弟
    周正敏站在师傅的机床的对面。师傅的车刀转动的时候，她就很快地浇上肥皂水；师傅把一件工作物车好，她就马上把铁屑扫净。因为有了这样一个好徒弟，孙松生的脸上常呈现着满意的笑容。
    周正敏是苏州铁工厂第一批科室下放干部中的一个。她被批准下放以后，非常高兴。她特地把爱人送给她的一本笔记本拿出来，记参加劳动的日记。她平常很喜欢她那留了五年多的长长的辫子。但是，当她知道在车间操作有长辫子不方便的时候，就毅然决然地把它剪掉了。在科室里，她上下班都乘公共汽车；到车间以后，她下班常常步行，锻炼自己的腿劲，以适应车间劳动。她到车间以后，在收拾工具、整理机床和清洁工作场地等方面，都很勤快；对于一些不懂的问题，就虚心地向师傅请教。
    她的师傅孙松生，对这位勤快的徒弟也很关心和体贴。徒弟替他浇肥皂水，他就讲肥皂水对于金属切削所起的作用；换刀，就讲横进刀和纵进刀的变换法。遇到加工余量多的件头，师傅还让徒弟实地学习操作。孙松生怕刚刚走出办公室的徒弟一天站八小时吃不消，就教徒弟用两只脚替换休息，并且解释说：“马站着的时候，不是总有两只腿是弯着的吗？这就是它在休息。”下班以后，徒弟揩擦机床，师傅就拿起扫帚来扫地。周正敏说：“师傅，这些杂事让我来做吧！”师傅说：“我们师徒，不是一般的师徒，我们应该互相帮助，文武交流。”
　　 “我的改造更彻底”
    在上海船舶修造厂的放样台上，刚到工地做放样工的青年技术员倪一冲，得到老师傅沈金弟等的培养和教育，在劳动生产上、生活习惯上和阶级觉悟上都开始有了变化。
    倪一冲到工地的第一天，八级放样工沈金弟就带他到船上爬上爬下，做测量、望光等工作。沈师傅这种不辞辛苦培养年青一代工人的精神，使这位青年技术员很感动。以后，遇到辛苦的劳动，他总是争着去干。放样台上的工作是整天蹲在地上划线，开头几天他蹲得腰酸背痛，站也站不起来。但是，他看到沈师傅为了把线划得更正确，使船只制造得更美观，对每根线都是考虑再三，划了再划，他就坚持在放样台上蹲下去；半个月以后，他同沈师傅一样，蹲上一天半天腰都不痛了。
    在做了半个月的工人，同沈师傅等一同生活、一同劳动以后，倪一冲感到在新的岗位上，不论在生产技术或政治思想方面，都有自己学不完的东西。每天在上班之前或下班休息时，他总是要把老师傅讲的话、做的工作以及自己的体会，写成工作日记；半个月来写的日记，比在做八个月技术员时写的还多。在劳动的锻炼中，他不仅亲切地体会到理论必须同实践相结合，而且进一步认识了工人们有着一双勤俭的手，坚定的立场，聪明的头脑。如民主轮上某块船头板放样时，设计科图纸上是整块的，但沈师傅却建议把它剖为两块来放样和加工，这样可以减少火工工人加工的困难，节约了许多劳力和工时。从这件事上，倪一冲感到坐在办公室里的设计人员因为没有参加过划线、火工等体力劳动，对下边的困难就体会不深，设计时考虑问题就没有他师傅想得周到。
    倪一冲出身于地主家庭。他在短短的半个月的劳动锻炼中，深深地感到只有在劳动中才能彻底改造自己。当另一位青年技术员问他，我不当工人，但在工作中下去和工人一起劳动与工人打成一片，能不能改造自己时，他答复说，你这样做也可以改造一下思想，但不可能改造得彻底。因为你的身份是助理工段长，不是工人，在工地上刮大风、下大雪，你可以回到办公室烤火炉，没有人来讲你；而我当了工人，就得坚持下去，改造就比你要彻底。
    炼钢姑娘
    在炼钢炉旁，一位年青的姑娘操着铁扒，从火焰熊熊的炼钢炉里往外扒渣。在她前面，有一位老工人帮着她。从表面上，看不出她和小伙子有什么两样。这就是沈阳矿山机器厂紧缩机构的时候，志愿要求下放作一个炼钢工人的原锻冶科中央化验室见习技术员李淑媛。
    李淑媛来到炼钢炉旁的第一天，心里有些紧张，被那三、四十斤重的大铁扒吓住了；她想：我拿都拿不起来，怎能扒渣呢？老师傅李学金和段伦有看出了她的心思，便立即找轻便工具给她用，还把铁扒头上的钢板改成木头的。用这种扒，开始的时候小伙子们笑话她；可是现在，全组用的扒都同她用的一样了。因为这种扒不仅使用轻便，节省钢板，扒渣效率也可以提高将近一倍。
    老师傅李学金夸奖她说：她来的时间虽短，可什么活都抢着干，不怕脏，挺细心，还能和大家团结。小组里过去有些生产不大积极的徒工，在她的影响下也积极起来了。
　  突击队的好队员
    太原肥料厂建设工地一座简陋的工棚里，最近新添了两位青年木工。他们是刚下放到生产岗位的工区人事调配员孙盛甲和浙江大学应届毕业生吴澄清。
    这两位新来的木工，到工地就参加了沈妙法青年突击队。这几天，工人们在建设一座结构复杂的水塔，但是因为看不懂设计图纸，施工搁浅了。队员们知道孙盛甲以前当过木工，吴澄清是在大学学土木工程的，当然能看懂图纸。因此，就推荐他俩按照图纸为工人们做一个模型。他俩虽然感到有些生疏，但是愉快地接受了这项任务。
    这个青年突击队是工地上最活跃的一个。哪里需要他们就到哪里去。孙盛甲随同大家，今天做门框，明天补屋面。前些时候，队员们用高粱秸做屋顶，他提出用废弃的木料钉住散乱的高粱秸，不用麻绳扎。这样不仅能防止屋顶过早地腐烂，而且超额30％完成了任务。工人们都说他是青年突击队的优秀木工。
　  运动员学会车毛胚
    重庆通用机器厂各车间，最近出现了一批受老工人们欢迎的新工人。从他们满身油污、一手厚茧和愉快劳动的神情上，很难辨认出他们是大专学校毕业的、下放到车间不久的干部。
    今年才从北京石油学院毕业的施昌明，现在是金工车间老工人们一致赞扬的出色学徒工。一个月以前，他从科室下放到车间的时候，便决心在劳动中努力锻炼和改造自己。他在车床上总是拣重活做，每天都把做生活的准备工作和车床的清洁工作做得很好，让他的师傅省了许多气力和时间。如摇车床的摇把、拿千斤顶等，以前都由一两个辅助工帮助老师傅做，还感到吃力；现在施昌明一个人主动干这些笨活，他只用一只手便将车床摇把摇得风车般转。车间工人们都赞扬他的干劲和气力。经过打听，才知道他曾经是北京市的举重运动员。施昌明处处尊敬师傅，虚心学习业务，在一个多月就学会了车毛胚活。
