Concentrated Attack on the Party's Leadership of Science
　　Old Rightist Element Ye Duzhuang Exposed

　　(Our dispatch) The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences has exposed another old-brand rightist element – Ye Duzhuang. Ye Duzhuang was the chairman of the China Democratic League branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, a political swindler mixed into the scientific community.

　　For a long time, Ye Duzhuang used the China Democratic League organization as a tool for him to oppose the Communist Party and compete with the Communist Party for leadership. He complained that "the League only participates in construction, but cannot participate in design." He concentrated his attacks on the Party's leadership of science, slandering the Party's leadership as "dogmatists who are always talking about that set of impractical empty words." He undermined the relationship between the Party and intellectuals, defaming the Communist Party's view of intellectuals as "those not of my race must have a different mind." During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign, his long-hidden reactionary history was investigated. After the campaign, he clamored everywhere that he was originally fragrant, but the Communist Party made him stink, and he ran around everywhere to reverse the verdict.

    集中攻击党对科学的领导
　　老右派分子叶笃庄被揪出
    本报讯　中国农业科学院又揪出了一个老牌右派分子——叶笃庄。叶笃庄是民盟中国农业科学院支部主任委员，一个混在科学界的政治骗子。
    叶笃庄长期把民盟组织作为他反对共产党、同共产党争夺领导权的工具。他埋怨“盟只是参加施工，而不能参加设计”。他集中攻击党对科学的领导，污蔑党的领导是“永远说那套不着边际的空话的教条主义者”。他破坏党与知识分子的关系，诋毁共产党对知识分子的看法是“非我族类，其心必异”。肃反运动中，他长期隐瞒的反动历史受到了审查，肃反后他到处叫嚷说他原来是香的，共产党把他搞臭了，到处奔走翻案。
