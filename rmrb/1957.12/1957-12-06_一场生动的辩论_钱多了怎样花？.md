　　A Lively Debate
　　How to Spend More Money?
　　Wang Shijian
　　After the Kuaihuolin Village of Kuaihuolin Township in Xinglong County, Hebei, became the Zhongxing Advanced Cooperative, it had bumper harvests of pears and fruits for two consecutive years. The entire cooperative has 202 households and 999 people. This year, 10 households received more than 1,000 yuan, 111 households received more than 500 yuan, and 81 households received less than 500 yuan. Bai Yong'an's family has three laborers who worked 850 labor days this year. After deducting the food rations for 12 people, they received 883 yuan in cash. Including sideline occupations and the sale of pears and fruits from private plots, the total income reached 1,141 yuan.
　　With more money in their hands, the villagers began to spend it indiscriminately. To cite a few of the most obvious examples, 102 people in the cooperative had gold teeth installed. Wang Guichun's son, who is mute, also had a full set of gold teeth installed and wore a top hat. This year, the cooperative purchased more than 1,490 woolen sweaters. On one day in October, more than 100 yuan was spent on taking photos, and 32 bicycles were purchased. Every time the supply and marketing cooperative brought in vermicelli, sneakers, and non-staple foods, they were sold out within five days. The issues of repaying loans, increasing accumulation to expand production, practicing thrift, and saving were rarely discussed. The cadres had advised the villagers to "spend sparingly." But the villagers said, "What's the use of keeping money if you don't spend it?"
　　The township and cooperative cadres had studied this situation many times, but they could not find a proper solution. In early November, the district committee decided to conduct a socialist debate in the cooperative. The county and district work teams and township and cooperative cadres all believed that with so much money in the hands of the villagers, the issue of spending was a major one. They decided to organize the villagers to debate the matter.
　　During the airing of views, the villagers had various ideas. The elderly said that they had suffered a lifetime of hardship, and now they were enjoying their old age, so eating and drinking a little was not considered wasteful. The young people liked to be extravagant, and generally said that now that they had more money, wearing a short coat, riding a bicycle after work, and listening to Peking Opera on the radio at night was not excessive! The women said that nothing was better than tall buildings with tiled roofs and courtyards, lime ceilings and brick floors, chests on the kang and cabinets on the ground.
　　After a period of airing views, the villagers were organized to debate two topics. The first topic was: "Compared to the lives of Soviet farmers, are you satisfied with your current situation?" The debate was very lively. Some of the elderly said that they had never had so much money in all their years, and this was the first time they had ever had so much money, so they were satisfied. However, most of the young people said that if they were satisfied, they wouldn't be learning from the Soviet farmers to walk the path of communism. Youth League member Gao Xiurong said: "I am not satisfied. If we don't improve production further, I think we will spend all this money and have nothing to look forward to." In the end, the opinion of learning from the Soviet farmers prevailed. In this situation, the second topic, "How do you plan to live a better life?" was put forward for further discussion. In the beginning, everyone talked about production. There were three different opinions: the first was "Don't do anything new, just keep doing what we've been doing for the past two years." The second opinion was "I have no objection to how we do it, but the state has to help with some money." Most of those who held these two opinions were middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants, who were afraid of investing. The third opinion was "The bumper harvests of the past two years were because the advanced cooperative was strong. If we want to be richer, we have to fill the gullies, build terraces, tend the fruit trees, and apply more fertilizer to the land." Villager Wang Jiang said: Song Yong's fruit trees had not produced fruit for twenty-six years, but after joining the cooperative, they had bumper harvests for two consecutive years. If you don't put in the effort, how can you have so much money? Poor peasant Zhou Yucun said: "In the past, we had little money and relied on state assistance. Now that we have so much money, we still ask the government for help. I don't think I can bring myself to say that." The result of the debate was that the majority of villagers unanimously agreed to raise this year's public accumulation fund from the originally planned 6% to 14%, and the public welfare fund from the originally planned 1% to 1.5%. In addition, the villagers invested 2,000 yuan in cash to the cooperative as construction costs for developing 100 mu of paddy fields. The villagers said: "Ah, this time, it feels like a real plan for a better future."

### 一场生动的辩论　钱多了怎样花？

　　一场生动的辩论
　　钱多了怎样花？
　　王世俭
    河北兴隆县快活林乡快活林村建成中兴高级社后，连续二年梨果大丰收。全社二百零二户，九百九十九口人。今年分一千元以上的有十户，分五百元以上的有一百十一户，分五百元以下的八十一户。社员白永安全家三个劳力，今年做了八百五十个劳动日，扣除十二口人的口粮外，还分八百八十三元现金。如果加上家庭副业和卖自留梨果收入，总共就达一千一百四十一元。
    社员手里钱多了，一时就出现了乱花钱的现象。就拿几个最明显的事来说吧，全社一百零二人新安上了金牙，王桂春的儿子是个哑吧，也安上满嘴金牙，戴上了礼帽。今年全社新买的绒衣就是一千四百九十多件。10月份的一天，光照像钱就花了一百多元，还买了三十二辆自行车。供销社每次进粉条、球鞋、副食品等，不到五天准卖得光光的。还贷款，增加积累扩大生产，勤俭持家，储蓄等问题，则很少听到有人议论了。干部们曾劝社员“省着点花”。社员却说“有钱不花，放着无用。”
    乡社干部对这种情况曾研究了多少次，但总没找出妥善的解决办法。11月初，区委决定在这个社进行社会主义大辩论，县区工作组和乡社干部都认为，社员钱这样多，花钱问题是个大事。便决定组织社员把这个事辩论辩论。
    在鸣放中，社员的思想各色各样，老头们说，受了一辈子苦，现在有了老来福，吃点喝点还算浪费？青年人好阔气，一般说法是，手头松了，穿上小大衣，打完场骑上自行车溜一溜，晚上扭开收音机听听北京大戏，这也不算过分吧！妇女说，什么也不如高楼瓦房大院墙，石灰顶棚砖铺地，炕上箱子地下柜。
    经过一段鸣放后，就组织社员辩论两个题目，第一个题目是：“比比苏联农民的生活，你现在是不是知足了？”辩论非常热烈。一些老头的说法是，活这么多年，哪年也没有过这么多钱，这还是大姑娘坐轿头一回，知足了。但是，大部分青年人说，说知足就甭学苏联农民走共产主义了。青年团员高秀荣说：“我是不知足，如果不把生产再提高一步，我看把这两个钱花光了，还指望啥。”辩论到最后，还是向苏联农民看齐的意见占了上风。在这种情况下，就把第二个题目“你打算怎样过更好的生活”提出来继续讨论。开头大家就说到生产上来了。共有三种不同意见：第一种是“甭搞新鲜样的，照这二年一样干就行。”第二种意见是“怎样搞也没意见，不过国家得帮助点钱。”提这两种意见的人，大部分是中农和富裕中农，他们怕投资。第三种意见是“这二年丰收是因为高级社力量大，要想更富裕还得填山沟、修梯田、侍弄果树、往地里多上粪。社员王江说：宋永的果树二十六年没结果，入社后连二年大丰收，你说不下力量靠啥有这么多钱。贫农周玉存说：“以前咱们钱少靠国家帮助，现在钱这么多还叫政府帮助，我看这话说不出口去。”辩论结果是：大多数社员一致同意，把今年的公积金从原来计划的6％提到14％，公益金从原来的1％提到1.5％。此外，社员还向社投资二千元现款，作为开一百亩稻田的建设费用。社员说：“嗳，这回吗，还像个过大日子的打算。”
