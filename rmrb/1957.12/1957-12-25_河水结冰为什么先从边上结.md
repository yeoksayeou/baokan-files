Why?

    Why Does River Ice Form First on the Edges?
    The water on the riverbank is shallower and less mobile. After the heat it contains dissipates, it is not quickly replenished from elsewhere. The water in the middle of the river is deeper, and the total amount of heat contained under the same size of water surface is more than that of the water on the riverbank, so it cools down more slowly. At the same time, the water in the center of the river has greater mobility, and heat is easily replenished. Therefore, the water on the riverbank cools down faster than the water in the center of the river and freezes first. (Zhe)

    河水结冰为什么先从边上结
    河边上的水比较浅，流动性也比较小，它所含的热散出去以后，不会很快地由别处补充进来。而河中间的水比较深，同样大小的水面下所含的总热量要比河边上的水多，所以它冷的也比较慢；同时河心的水流动性大，热量容易补充。因此河边上的水要比河心的水冷得快，先结冰。　　　（哲）
