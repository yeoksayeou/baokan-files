Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 14th: Hong Kong News: Local newspapers reported on December 5th that the outgoing Governor of Hong Kong, Grantham, formally interacted with figures from the so-called "Industrial and Commercial Delegation of the Republic of China" recently sent to Hong Kong from Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek clique when he attended a farewell cocktail party held for him by the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong on the 4th, and took photos with the "head and deputy head" of this "delegation." Industrial and commercial figures who attended the cocktail party were very surprised by Grantham's move, because the British government had announced its recognition of the People's Republic of China as early as 1950 and had withdrawn its recognition of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Grantham, in his capacity as a representative of the British government, so welcomed and supported this "delegation" whose purpose is to oppose the unification of the motherland, which is obviously extremely unfriendly to the Chinese people and incompatible with the existing diplomatic relations between Britain and China.

These industrial and commercial figures also pointed out that at a time when the United States is making every effort to conspire to create the so-called "two Chinas," Grantham's actions cannot but draw attention.

    葛量洪的举动违背中英外交关系
    公然支持蒋介石集团在港活动
    据新华社广州14日电　香港消息：此间报纸本月5日报道，即将卸任的香港英国当局的总督葛量洪4日在参加香港中华厂商联合会为他举行的一个送别鸡尾酒会的时候，同蒋介石集团最近从台湾派遣来香港的所谓“中华民国工商界代表团”人物正式交往，并同这个“代表团”的“正副团长”摄影留念。参加这次酒会的工商界人士对葛量洪的这一举动感到十分诧异，因为英国政府早在1950年就宣布承认中华人民共和国，并撤销了对蒋介石集团的承认。葛量洪以英国政府代表的身份竟对这个以反对祖国统一为目的的“代表团”如此欢迎和支持，显然是对中国人民极不友好的，也和英国同中国的现存外交关系不相容的。
    这些工商界人士还指出，在美国正在竭力阴谋制造所谓“两个中国”的今天，葛量洪的举动不能不令人注意。
