　　Liaoning Mountainous Areas Vigorously Carry Out Soil and Water Conservation Work
　　Winter Soil and Water Conservation Upsurge Sweeps the Yellow River Middle Reaches

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st – Mountainous areas of Liaoning Province are vigorously building check dams and terraces, and planting trees extensively to carry out soil and water conservation work. In the past five years, an area of more than one million hectares has been brought under control. In the mountainous areas where soil erosion has been controlled, the unit area yield of grain has generally increased by 30% to 50% compared with before soil and water conservation.

    Mountainous areas in Liaoning Province account for more than 60% of the province's total area, and the cultivated land in mountainous areas accounts for 27% of the province's total cultivated land. In the past, many mountainous areas suffered from increasingly serious soil erosion due to the destruction of forests and indiscriminate cultivation on mountain slopes. According to preliminary estimates by relevant departments, the area of soil erosion in the province is approximately 4.15 million hectares, and the amount of sediment flowing from mountain slopes each year is approximately 70 million cubic meters, resulting in a year-by-year decline in farmland yields. At the same time, a large amount of sediment flows downstream, silting up riverbeds and causing frequent floods and waterlogging disasters in the plains.

    Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the people in mountainous areas have vigorously carried out soil and water conservation work. In the four years from 1953 to 1956 alone, the people in mountainous areas built more than 240,000 check dams, constructed 120,000 hectares of field projects, closed hillsides for afforestation on 220,000 hectares, and planted trees on more than 270,000 hectares. Many farmers in mountainous areas have also created experiences in controlling soil erosion such as building drainage ditches, changing horizontal ridges, building contour lines, and planting alfalfa grass strips. After comprehensive management, agricultural production in many mountainous areas has increased significantly, and the appearance of the mountainous areas has undergone fundamental changes. For example, Beisijiazi Township in Chaoyang County has built large-scale soil and water conservation projects in recent years, and the entire township has basically achieved "sloping land terraced, platform land irrigated, gullies and terraces transformed, and barren mountains and wastelands all greened." Grain yield is even higher than in general plain areas. The Bapangou Production Team of the township's agricultural cooperative built terraces on barren mountains with a slope of 25 degrees and strengthened field technical management, creating a high-yield record of more than 1,200 jin of corn per mu for two consecutive years.

    Xinhua News Agency, 28th – The soil and water conservation work in the middle reaches of the Yellow River has achieved great success. To date, the area of soil erosion that has been initially controlled has reached 78,800 square kilometers. The winter upsurge of soil and water conservation has emerged again in many places, and tens of thousands of farmers are unfolding a vigorous winter repair work in various places.

    Various soil and water conservation tasks in the middle reaches of the Yellow River have been completed 65% this year, which can control soil erosion on more than 16,800 square kilometers of land. Coupled with the work completed in previous years, the area of soil and water initially controlled in the middle reaches of the Yellow River has reached 78,850 square kilometers. This area accounts for 13.6% of the total area of soil erosion in the middle reaches. These achievements have played a significant role in increasing agricultural production in the middle reaches. In Luochuan County, Shaanxi Province, located in the gully area of the Loess Plateau, 76% of the county's cultivated land has been brought under control of soil erosion. These projects have all played a role in intercepting floods, conserving moisture, and preventing drought this year. It is estimated that the county can increase grain production by more than 480,000 jin.

    Recently, various places in the middle reaches of the Yellow River have summarized the achievements of soil and water conservation work in the winter of 1955 and 1956, criticized right-leaning conservative thinking, and cadres and farmers in various places are in high spirits. At present, they are striding towards a high tide in the soil and water conservation movement. Gansu Province proposed: Areas that have completed this year's soil and water conservation plan will complete another 30% to 50% of next year's task this winter and spring; those that have basically completed this year's task will complete another 20% to 30% of next year's task; and those that have not yet completed this year's task must ensure and overfulfill this year's task. The province has afforested 1.02 million mu in the autumn, and by mid-October it had completed soil and water conservation work that can control soil erosion in an area of 800 square kilometers. Pingliang Prefecture had overfulfilled this year's soil and water conservation task by the beginning of this month. Jiyuan County in Henan Province decided to eliminate ordinary drought disasters within three years and green the entire county within five years; this winter and spring, another 164 small reservoirs will be built, and 30,000 water cellars will be dug, so that 80% of the soil erosion area in mountainous and hilly areas will be controlled. Wangwu Township, Jiyuan County, the "hometown of the foolish old man who moved mountains," has mobilized more than 1,200 people to go up the mountains and into the gullies to fully launch soil and water conservation work.

### 坡地梯田化、台地水利化、荒山荒地都绿化　辽宁山区大力开展水土保持工作　黄河中游地区掀起冬季水土保持高潮

　　坡地梯田化、台地水利化、荒山荒地都绿化
　　辽宁山区大力开展水土保持工作
　　黄河中游地区掀起冬季水土保持高潮
    新华社沈阳1日电　辽宁省山区大力兴修谷坊、梯田，广植林木，开展水土保持工作，五年来已控制水土流失面积达一百多万公顷。在已控制了水土流失的山区土地上，粮食单位面积产量一般都比进行水土保持前提高了30％到50％。
    辽宁省山区面积占全省总面积的60％以上，山区已耕地占全省总耕地面积的27％。许多山区过去由于森林被破坏，山坡滥行垦植，水土流失日趋严重。据有关部门初步估算，全省水土流失面积约达四百一十五万多公顷，每年从山坡上流失的泥沙量约有七千多万公方，农田产量逐年下降；同时，大量泥沙下泄，淤积河床，使平原地区经常发生洪水雨涝灾害。
    解放以来，在党和人民政府领导下，山区人民大力开展水土保持工作。仅1953年到1956年四年间，山区人民即修筑谷坊二十四万多座，兴修田间工程十二万公顷，封山育林二十二万公顷，造林二十七万多公顷。许多山区农民还创造了修撩壕、改横垅、修等高线和种苜蓿草带等控制水土流失的经验。许多山区经过综合治理之后，农业生产显著增长，山区面貌发生了根本变化。如朝阳县北四家子乡几年来大修水土保持工程，全乡基本上达到“坡地梯田化，台地水利化，沟川台地化，荒山荒地都绿化”。粮食产量比一般平原地区还高。这个乡农业社的八盘沟生产队，在坡度二十五度的瘠薄山地上修梯田，加强田间技术管理，连续两年创造了亩产玉米一千二百多斤的高产纪录。
    新华社28日讯　黄河中游地区水土保持工作取得巨大成绩，到目前止，初步控制水土流失面积已达七万八千八百多平方公里。今冬水土保持高潮又已在许多地方出现，数以万计的农民正在各地展开如火如荼的冬修工作。
    黄河中游地区今年度保持水土各项工作已完成65％，共可控制一万六千八百多平方公里土地的水土流失。加上以前几年完成的工作，黄河中游地区初步控制水土面积已达七万八千八百五十多平方公里。这个面积占中游水土流失总面积13.6％。这些成绩对中游地区农业增产起了显著功效。位于黄土高原沟壑区的陕西省洛川县，全县76％的耕地已控制了水土流失。这些工程今年都已起了拦蓄洪水、保墒防旱作用，据推算全县可增产粮食四十八万多斤。
    最近，黄河中游各地总结了1955年冬和1956年水土保持工作成绩，批判了右倾保守思想，各地干部和农民劲头很大，目前正在大踏步地走向水土保持运动高潮。甘肃省提出：已经完成今年水土保持计划的地区，今冬明春再完成明年任务的30％到50％；基本上完成今年任务的，再完成明年任务的20％到30％；还没有完成今年任务的，要保证和超额完成今年的任务。全省秋季已造林一百零二万亩，到10月中旬又完成了可控制八百平方公里的水土流失面积的水土保持工作。平凉专区至本月初就已超额完成了今年的水土保持任务。河南省济源县决定在三年内消灭普通旱灾，五年绿化全县；今冬明春再修建小水库一百六十四个，打水窖三万个，使山区和丘陵区水土流失面积有80％得到控制。“愚公移山之乡”——济源县王屋乡，已经出动一千二百多人，上山进沟，全面展开水土保持工作。
