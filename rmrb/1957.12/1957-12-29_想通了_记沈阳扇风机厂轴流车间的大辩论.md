    Figured It Out
    —A Record of the Great Debate in the Axial Flow Workshop of Shenyang Fan Factory
    By Our Reporter Wen Tianshen
    The great debate among apprentices in the axial flow workshop of Shenyang Fan Factory is still ongoing. There are debates between masters and apprentices, between groups, at meetings, and even during walks and meals in groups of three or five.
    Lu Xichen, an old worker in the centrifugal workshop, has a daughter, Lu Yurong, who is also an apprentice in the axial flow workshop. One day at home, her father asked her about the debates in the workshop with concern. The daughter said that the three-year apprenticeship period was too long. The two of them started arguing.
    The father said, "How can our apprentices today think like this? Have you forgotten what I used to tell you: how difficult it was to learn skills in the old society! Masters would send apprentices away to do odd jobs while they were working, and apprentices could only learn secretly. Now the country is helping you learn skills, and you're still haggling?"
    The daughter said, "This isn't haggling, it's that our apprentices today are more educated, have better conditions, and can learn skills faster. It doesn't take three years!"
    The father got angry: "You have education, isn't that because the workers are in charge? Otherwise, would girls like you be able to become apprentices?"
    Lu Yurong heard her father talk about the old society again. How her father used to work, and the whole family starved and froze; how before liberation the capitalists sold the factory machines, her father lost his job, and the whole family wandered around. She had heard her father talk about it countless times. But her father still said, "Today our workers are in charge, and everyone is well-fed and clothed. Child, why don't you think about how much you've contributed to the country? Have your skills met the country's requirements? Just wanting to upgrade, can you live up to the country's cultivation?"
    The two of them argued unhappily. After her father went to bed, the daughter thought alone for a long time.
    The next day after work, the workshop held another debate. Lu Yurong didn't plan to speak, but listened attentively.
    First, a welding apprentice named Li Huiwen said with confidence: "I can already do the work of a level three worker, and after doing it for almost two years, they want to extend the apprenticeship period. I don't think it's reasonable!"
    Unexpectedly, the master who was teaching him was sitting right next to him. The master immediately stood up to refute him, saying, "A level three worker should be able to do vertical welding, but the 'air duct' you welded recently looked like toad skin! If you don't believe me, everyone can go to the section to see." Then he said, "Although some apprentices have been working for almost two years, they still can't handle some of the work. The country is spending money to train you, and as soon as you can do a little work, you want to upgrade. Is that reasonable?..."
    Several apprentices spoke up in disagreement. They intentionally turned the topic to the twenty-eight yuan subsidy and listed many facts to show that the subsidy was too small and not enough. They said, "Can this motivate us?" Apprentice Qu Lan added, "Some apprentices have to support their families. When we entered the factory, it was eighteen yuan, and now after learning skills for more than a year, it's only twenty-eight yuan. It's too low."
    The workshop accountant, Old Zhuang, immediately stood up to debate. He calculated everyone's food expenses, three meals of fine grains a day, fifteen yuan per month; two sets of single-layer clothing a year, one set of cotton clothing every two years or so, averaging two yuan and fifty cents per month, plus shoes, hats, towels, soap, pocket money, etc., averaging two yuan and fifty cents per month. In this way, an apprentice's monthly expenses only need about twenty yuan. Twenty-eight yuan is not low, but high. Regarding supporting a family, he said, "Apprentices mainly study, rather than create wealth for the country, and the state should not cover everything. In fact, the factory already takes care of apprentices with special circumstances. However, the best way is to respond to the country's call and mobilize family members to return to the countryside to participate in agricultural production."
    After Old Zhuang finished calculating, the atmosphere in the meeting became tense. Suddenly, a young man said, "No, I object to calculating the accounts too tightly. Apprentices want to watch movies, buy technical books... these haven't been counted."
    Lu Yurong thought, "No, the young men's demands are too excessive."
    Sure enough, Tian Yuheng, a riveter master who was very close to Lu Yurong's father, spoke: "Young men, don't be ungrateful. Did you bring those twill pants and those hats (he pointed to the Ukrainian hats that the apprentices loved to wear) from home? And only eat fine grains!"
    Another master continued, "I agree with the accounts calculated by accountant Old Zhuang. I think calculating fine grains is still a bit generous. Why can't we eat coarse grains and be more frugal?" He pointed to the young man who had just spoken and said, "If you want to read books, the factory has a library. To watch movies, the factory also shows them every week. If you can really read several technical books every month, then the third artificial satellite would probably have flown into space in China long ago."
    Lu Yurong knew that the masters were using humorous language, which meant that they were already very dissatisfied with the situation. Sure enough, Master Deng Qingcheng, who was sitting nearby, raised his hand to speak. He said, "The apprentices may not want to hear what I have to say, but I still have to say it. In the old society, I apprenticed for four years, and the capitalists wanted me to work for him without pay. When I was an apprentice, I didn't have enough to eat or wear, not to mention taking care of the master's children and emptying his chamber pot. If anyone didn't do it, the apprentice's three families would be jointly and severally liable. Once when I was working, my eyes were damaged by sparks. The capitalists not only didn't treat me, but also drove me away like a dog..."
    Listening and listening, Lu Yurong also remembered the situation of her father's unemployment and the suffering of the whole family, and her eyes also became wet.
    This master said, "Today we have turned over, and the country cares about you everywhere. You have labor insurance benefits like the masters, sign master-apprentice contracts, and the country expects you to learn your skills well so that everyone can live well. But you can't forget your roots!"
    As soon as this master finished speaking, someone said with emotion, "Young men, let's start from the six hundred million people and compare ourselves with the peasant brothers to see if the apprentice treatment is really low or not?"
    At this time, Lu Yurong's thinking had changed. She felt that she should no longer participate in this debate with a somewhat "aggrieved" mood.
    However, some apprentices, seeing that the masters were using the method of comparing the new and old societies to debate with them, simply put forward the reason that "the new and old societies are incomparable" to defend themselves. Apprentice Qu Lan said, "In the old society, who controlled the political power and economic lifeline? The masters suffered a lot in the old society, and these were given by the reactionaries. And we are apprentices in the new society today." He said with great confidence, "The nature of society is different, so there is no way to compare."
    An apprentice who came from the countryside also objected to comparing with the peasants, saying that the peasants in the countryside eat pickles and green onions, and their expenses are low.... Lu Yurong felt very disgusted when she heard this.
    Before this apprentice could finish speaking, many masters were vying to speak. "What, do you want to learn from Liu Jiemei?"
    "Have you forgotten your class brothers soon after leaving the countryside?"
    Old worker Lu Hongquan suddenly stood up and said, "Only by comparing with the old society can we know that today we must treat labor with a more master-like attitude; only by comparing with the peasants can we know that we should share weal and woe with the peasant brothers and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. Our country has been established for less than ten years and is still a backward agricultural country. Is it okay not to practice thrift and build the country diligently? The lives of Soviet workers today were also obtained by fighting off armed enemies and fighting against economic difficulties in the early days of their country's establishment. If you don't compare this, you don't compare that, do you just want to compare to living a good life?" Finally, he said very excitedly, "No, young men. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party taught us to look at problems from the perspective of six hundred million people, and not to just want to enjoy personal happiness. Only when everyone works hard can there be happiness."
    The masters presented the facts and reasoned step by step, and even the several apprentices who had just spoken felt that there was no reason to argue.
    Lu Yurong remembered the scene of arguing with her father. When she returned home that day, she admitted to her father that her past thoughts were wrong. The two of them reconciled.
    The workshop's fifty-two young apprentices also successively admitted or criticized their past individualistic thoughts. Some said, "Compared with the peasants, compared with the technicians, compared with our own skills, our treatment is not low but high." Some said, "In the past, we only wanted to eat well, dress well, earn more money, and work less, but we forgot that the country's requirements for us are: good skills, good thoughts, and good health."

    想通了
    ——记沈阳扇风机厂轴流车间的大辩论
    本报记者　文天申
    沈阳扇风机厂轴流车间的徒工大辩论，还在进行着。师徒之间、小组之间，在大会上辩论，平常三几人在一起走路、吃饭，也辩论。
    离心车间老工人芦喜臣的女儿芦玉荣，也在轴流车间当徒工。有一天在家里，父亲关心地问女儿车间辩论的情况。女儿说，三年学徒期限太长了。爷俩因此争论了起来。
    父亲说：“怎么咱们今天的徒工还能这样想？你忘了我过去常讲的：在旧社会学技术多困难！师父干活时把徒工撵去打杂，徒工只能偷偷地学。现在国家帮助你们学技术，你们还要讲价钱？”
    女儿说：“这不是讲价钱，而是咱们今天的徒工比过去有文化，条件好，技术可以学得快，用不了三年！”
    父亲火了：“你们有文化，不都是工人当了家才有的？要不，你们女孩子也能当徒工？”
    芦玉荣又听父亲谈起旧社会来。如父亲过去干活，全家挨饿受冻呵，如解放前资本家卖了工厂机器，父亲失业，全家到处流浪呵，不知听到父亲讲过多少遍了。但是，父亲仍然说：“今天我们工人当了家，大家丰衣饱食。孩子，你怎么不想想：为国家贡献了多少？技术是不是达到了国家的要求？就想升级，能对得起国家的培养吗？”
    爷俩争得很不愉快。父亲睡觉以后，女儿还独自想了很久。
    第二天下班，车间又开辩论会。芦玉荣不准备发言，专心地听着。
    最先是一个电焊徒工李惠文理直气壮地说：“我现在已能干三级工的活，干了快两年还要延长学徒期限，我认为不合理！”
    没想到带他干活的老师傅就坐在旁边。老师傅当时就起来反驳说：“三级工应该会立焊，可你最近焊的一个‘风筒’就像蛤蟆皮！不信，大家可到工段去看。”接着，他又说：“虽然有的徒工已经干了快两年，可有些活还拿不起来。国家花钱培养你们，你们刚能干点活，就要升级，合理吗？……”
    有几个徒工不服气地发言了。他们有意把话题转到二十八元补贴上来，并列举了许多事实来说明补贴太少，不够用。他们说：“这能发挥我们的积极性吗？”徒工曲岚还补充说：“有的徒工还要养家，我们进厂时是十八元，现在学了一年多技术才二十八元太低了。”
    车间经济员老庄马上起来辩论。他算了一下大家的伙食，一天三餐细粮，每月十五元；一年单衣两套，棉衣两年多一套，平均每月二元五角，外加鞋帽、手巾、肥皂、零用等平均每月二元五角，这样徒工一个月开支只要二十元左右。二十八元不是低了而是高了。关于养家，他说：“徒工主要是学习，而不是为国家创造财富，不应一切都由国家包干。实际上，徒工有特殊情况的，工厂已经给照顾。不过，最好的办法，还是响应国家号召，动员家属回乡参加农业生产。”
    老庄算完账，会场就紧张起来。忽然，有位小伙子说：“不行，反对把账算得太紧，徒工要看电影，要买技术书……这些都没算上。”
    芦玉荣想：“不成，小伙子们的要求太过分了。”
    果然，坐在会场右边和芦玉荣父亲很要好的铆工田玉恒师傅说话了：“小伙子们，不要人在福中不知福，你们穿的料子裤，戴的什么帽（他指徒工们爱戴的乌克兰帽），那样是家里带来的？还光吃细粮！”
    另一位老师傅接着说：“我同意经济员老庄算的账。算吃细粮，我认为还宽了一点。为什么我们不能吃粗粮，艰苦些呢？”他指着刚才发言的小伙子说：“要看书，厂里有图书馆，看电影，每周厂里也放映，如果你们真能每月念完几本技术书，那么，第三颗人造卫星恐怕早在中国飞上天了。”
    芦玉荣知道，老师傅们使用幽默的语言，就说明他们对于事情已经十分不满了。果然，坐在附近的邓庆澄老师傅举手发言了。他说：“我的话可能徒工不愿意听，但我还是要说。在旧社会，我学了四年徒，资本家还要我无代价地给他干活。学徒时，吃不饱，穿不暖，这都不用说，给师傅看小孩，倒尿壶也是常有的事。谁要不干，徒工都有三家连环保。有次干活，眼睛给崩坏了，资本家不仅不给治，而且还把我像狗一样地撵走。……”
    听着听着，芦玉荣也就想起父亲过去失业，全家受苦的情景，眼睛也湿润起来。
    这位老师傅说：“今天咱们翻身了，国家处处关心你们，你们和老师傅一样有劳保待遇，订师徒合同，国家指望你们学好本领，让所有的人生活都好。可不能忘本啊！”
    这位老师傅刚说完，有人就感动地说：“小伙子们，让我们从六亿人口出发，和农民兄弟比比，看徒工待遇到底低不低？”
    这时，芦玉荣的想法已经变了，她觉得不应再怀着有点“委屈”的心情参加这个辩论了。
    可是，还有几个徒工看到老师傅用新旧社会对比的办法和他们辩，索性就提出“新旧社会不可比”的理由来为自己辩护。徒工曲岚说：“旧社会，政权、经济命脉由谁掌握？老师傅在旧社会受了不少苦，这些都是反动派给的。而我们今天当徒工是在新社会里。”他很有把握地说：“社会性质不同，所以没法比。”
    有个从农村来的徒工也反对和农民比，说农民在农村吃咸菜大葱，开支少……。芦玉荣听了当时就很反感。
    没等这个徒工说完，许多老师傅都争着发言。“怎么，想学刘介梅？”
    “离开农村不久，就把自己的阶级弟兄忘了？”
    老工人路洪全忽然站起来说：“只有和旧社会比，我们才知道今天更要以主人翁的态度对待劳动；只有和农民对比，我们才知道应和农民兄弟同甘共苦，巩固工农联盟。我们的国家建国还不到十年，还是一个落后的农业国，不节衣缩食勤俭建国行吗？苏联工人今天的生活，也是他们在建国初期打退武装的敌人，和经济困难作斗争得来的。这不比，那不比，难道光想比过好生活？”最后，他十分激动地说：“不行呵，小伙子们。毛主席共产党教导我们从六亿人口出发看问题，不能光图自己个人享福。只有大家刻苦劳动，才有幸福。”
    老师傅一步一步地摆事实讲道理，连刚才发言的几个徒工也感到没道理可讲了。
    芦玉荣想起了和父亲争辩的情景。当天回家，她就向父亲承认了过去的想法不对。爷俩重新和好。
    车间的五十二名青年徒工也先后承认或批判了过去的个人主义思想。有的说：“我们的待遇和农民比、和技工比、和自己的技术比，都不是低了而是高了。”有的说：“过去，我们光想吃得好，穿得好，挣钱多，干活少，而忘了国家对我们的要求是：技术好、思想好、身体好。”（附图片）
    “你们有文化，不都是工人当了家才有的吗？”
