Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: The climax of the general rectification movement in the central government organs has basically taken shape. More than half of the units have begun to shift to organizing the labor training of cadres sent to lower levels. Based on this situation, the Party Committee of the Central Government Organs of the CPC held its 17th expanded meeting on the 19th, reviewed the progress of the rectification movement, called on Party organizations at all levels to seize the favorable opportunity, prevent slackness and pride, and further advance the rectification movement, and carry out the work of sending cadres to lower levels to participate in labor training in a planned and guided manner.

At the meeting, Gong Zirong, First Secretary of the Party Committee of the Central Government Organs, reported on the current situation and problems of general rectification and sending cadres down to lower levels in the central government organs. Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, spoke at the meeting.

The meeting pointed out that the central government organs, after the masses had spoken out freely and aired their views, concentrated their efforts for a period of time to carry out general rectification, and have achieved great results in a short period of time. According to statistics on December 15, more than 640,000 of the 1.04 million opinions put forward by the masses have been rectified, accounting for 62.1%. More than half of the units have rectified about 80%, and one-third of the units have rectified about 50%. This means that more than 80% of the units have entered the climax of rectification.

The meeting believed that such a large-scale rectification work, in terms of quantity and speed, is unprecedented.

However, the meeting emphasized that leaders should never be misled by some false rectification figures. In some units, the situation of dealing with rectification with a bureaucratic attitude is still very serious. The Party Committee meeting requested that all units that have not reached 70% to 80% in general rectification must actively carry out general rectification; all units should conduct strict inspections of rectification, especially mobilizing mass inspections from the bottom up.

Sending cadres down is an important part of the socialist revolution, and ideological and organizational work must be carried out in depth.

The meeting then focused on the issue of sending cadres to participate in labor training. At present, more than half of the central government organs have been fully engaged or will soon be fully engaged in the work of sending cadres down. The remaining units must also carry out this work by the end of December at the latest. In order to launch a high tide of sending cadres to participate in labor training in a planned and guided manner, the meeting requested that all organs must do the following:

First of all, there must be a correct understanding and comprehensive plan for sending cadres to participate in labor training. The meeting pointed out that the leading cadres of some units do not have a sufficient understanding of the political significance of sending cadres down. They do not regard this measure as an important component of the socialist revolution on the current political and ideological fronts, nor do they regard it as an important system for implementing the Party's cadre work line. They only regard sending cadres down as a good opportunity to reduce staffing and deal with surplus personnel, and are reluctant to send good cadres who need training down to participate in labor training. These understandings are all wrong and must be resolutely corrected.

The main direction of comprehensive planning for sending cadres down should be going up to the mountains and down to the countryside.

The meeting requested that all organs must have a comprehensive plan for sending cadres down, and must send cadres down to the labor front and grassroots work in batches and on a rotational basis for training, requiring that after several rounds of rotation and sending down within a certain period of time, the cadres of the organs can receive comprehensive training and transformation. As for the main direction of cadres sent down for physical labor training, it should be down to the countryside and up to the mountains to participate in agricultural and forestry labor; secondly, to participate in industrial, handicraft and other labor.

Secondly, leadership must be strengthened and ideological work must be carried out in a thorough and meticulous manner. The meeting believed that the work of sending cadres down is an arduous and complex ideological and organizational work, and simple and crude methods cannot be adopted. The meeting criticized the simplified methods of only satisfying with a mobilization report, then launching a registration campaign and banging gongs and drums, and mass discussions, believing that this cannot well solve the ideological concerns of cadres. On the contrary, it is easy to produce deviations of coercion and commandism.

An important part of doing a good job in ideological work is to mobilize the masses to raise questions, state difficulties, and talk about ideas, and launch a large-scale debate. The deeper the debate, the more profound the education the masses receive. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to mobilize the masses well, eliminate concerns, boldly speak out freely, and widely launch discussions through the way of mass self-education.

In addition, solving the practical difficulties of cadres sent down and doing a good job in family work is also an important part of ideological work, and must be done conscientiously with a responsible spirit.

The meeting emphasized that since the rectification, the political consciousness of the broad masses of cadres has been greatly improved. Underestimating this situation is a manifestation of not trusting the masses. As long as the Party organization can rely on the masses to earnestly carry out ideological work and repeatedly explain the Party's policies, they will surely consciously and actively respond to the Party's call and happily participate in labor training.

Units that have completed the general rectification phase should promptly switch to the work of sending cadres down.

In his speech, Xi Zhongxun called on all organs not to be satisfied with the percentage of rectification, and must make an effort to further advance the rectification movement. He said that the current rectification movement is becoming more and more in-depth, the tasks are becoming more and more arduous, and the problems are becoming more and more complex. All organs must not only rectify, but also send cadres down, and some must make up for the lack of free airing of views. Therefore, do not think that you can relax and be proud because you have some experience, otherwise you will make mistakes and take detours, which will delay the development of the movement.

Xi Zhongxun said that units with slower progress must learn from advanced units, seize the opportunity and catch up. He said that the current situation of sending cadres down is very good, but units that have not yet entered the climax of general rectification must make another effort and take effective measures to accelerate rectification, otherwise they should not rush to send cadres down.

Xi Zhongxun emphasized that in the general rectification phase, thousands of "small problems" were encountered. Every leader should not ignore these "small problems," and should not be too ambitious and neglect the basics; small problems are the root of big problems, and a pile of small problems becomes a big problem. Thoroughly solving these "small problems" will help to dig out the roots of the three bad ideologies. On the contrary, ignoring "small problems" will lead to big problems, which is something we leaders must be vigilant about.

Xi Zhongxun then put forward four issues that should be paid attention to in the current rectification movement: First of all, it is necessary to conduct a practical inspection of general rectification. He said that some organs, in order to create a situation of rectification, reluctantly create the situation and are satisfied with the numbers, which is wrong. You must know that the percentage is one thing, and the actual situation is another. You should check whether it has really been rectified? How was it rectified? Have the "small problems" been solved? The inspection should be carried out by combining leaders and the masses, requiring that one thing be done at a time, and resolutely opposing falsehood.

Secondly, we must strengthen the specific leadership of the rectification movement. It is not enough to have determination to lead the movement, and it is not enough to have determination without a method. The method comes from the masses, not from our brains out of thin air. Of course, the methods cannot be exactly the same, but the goal is the same, which is to rectify quickly and well.

Third, through general rectification, we must solve a large number of "small problems" on a large scale, and we must also raise big problems, and while sending cadres down, we will organize special groups and special personnel to study them, so as to prepare for in-depth rectification after sending down, so that the movement can be connected step by step.

Fourth, all units that have completed the general rectification phase should promptly switch to the work of sending cadres down. In the work of sending cadres down, ideological work must be fully done. The cadres who are sent down should debate, and the cadres who are not sent down should also participate in the debate, so that they can educate each other. Secondly, we must do a good job in arranging work. Administrative units and public institutions should be considered together, sent down together, and should not wait.

Cadres sent down are welcomed by the broad masses of farmers, and begin to understand the brilliance of the Party's cadre policy.

The heads of the rectification leading groups of the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Ministry of Foreign Trade introduced many vivid experiences on the work of sending cadres down at the meeting. The Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Public Security have conscientiously implemented the Party's cadre work line and have drawn out a group of excellent cadres to send down for training. When the list of cadres sent down by the two organs was announced, it gave the masses great encouragement. They understood that the leaders were not "shirking burdens," and their concerns were dispelled. In the process of conducting ideological education, the Ministry of Culture raised questions, stated difficulties, and talked about ideas, and then launched a large-scale debate, especially through the personal experiences of some cadres, reporting on the process of their ideological transformation, which achieved good results.

Xie Xuegong, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, recently made a special trip to accompany the cadres sent down to the rural areas of Hebei. At the meeting, he introduced the warm welcome these cadres received after arriving in the rural areas. Many county party secretaries and county heads personally carried luggage for the cadres sent down and introduced the local situation. Many old landladies had automatically made steamed buns a few days ago and enthusiastically prepared to receive guests from Beijing. Many landlords had cleaned the rooms in advance and posted slogans such as "Welcome Comrade XX to come down to participate in labor training." These scenes greatly moved the cadres sent down. These situations were beyond the expectations of many cadres sent down. From the very beginning, they were given the most vivid political lesson by the farmers, and began to understand the brilliance and correctness of the Party's cadre policy.

### 使机关干部得到全面锻炼和改造  中央国家机关党委会着重研究干部下放问题  所有单位对整改应发动群众进行自下而上的严格检查

    使机关干部得到全面锻炼和改造
    中央国家机关党委会着重研究干部下放问题
    所有单位对整改应发动群众进行自下而上的严格检查
    据新华社20日讯  目前中央国家机关一般整改运动的高潮已经基本形成，有半数以上的单位已经开始转入组织下放干部劳动锻炼的工作。中共中央国家机关委员会根据这种情况，在19日举行了第十七次扩大会议，检查了整风运动进展的情况，号召各机关党组织抓紧有利时机，防止松懈和骄傲，把整风运动再向前推进一步，有计划有领导地做好下放干部参加劳动锻炼的工作。
    会上，中央国家机关党委第一书记龚子荣报告了当前中央国家机关一般整改与下放干部的情况和问题，国务院秘书长习仲勋在会上讲了话。
    会议指出，中央国家机关在群众大鸣大放之后，集中一段时间，全力以赴，进行一般整改，在短短的时间内，已经取得了很大成绩。根据12月15日的统计，群众提出的一百零四万条意见，已经整改了六十四万多条，占总数的62.1％。有半数以上的单位整改了80％左右，有三分之一的单位整改了50％左右，这就是说80％以上的单位已经进入整改高潮。
    会议认为，这样大规模的进行整改工作，其数量之大，速度之快，都是空前的。
    但是会议强调指出，领导者绝不应该被某些虚假的整改数字所迷惑，在一些单位中，以官僚主义的态度对待整改的情况还是十分严重的。党委会议要求，凡是一般整改没有达到70％到80％的单位，必须积极进行一般整改；所有单位都应该对整改进行严格的检查，特别是要自下而上地发动群众性的检查。
    下放干部是社会主义革命重要部分必须深入进行思想工作和组织工作
    会议接着着重讨论了关于下放干部参加劳动锻炼的问题。目前中央国家机关有半数以上的单位已经全力进行或即将全力进行下放干部的工作，其余单位至迟也都要在12月底以前进行这一工作。为了有计划有领导地掀起一个下放干部参加劳动锻炼的热潮，会议要求各机关必须作好以下几件工作：
    首先，对下放干部参加劳动锻炼必须要有正确的认识和全面规划。会议指出，有些单位的领导干部对下放干部的政治意义认识不足，没有把这一措施看作是目前政治战线上和思想战线上社会主义革命的一个重要组成部分，没有看作是贯彻执行党的干部工作路线的一项重要制度。他们把下放干部只看作是紧缩编制和处理编余人员的好机会，舍不得把需要锻炼的好干部放下去参加劳动锻炼。这些认识都是错误的，必须切实纠正。
    必须全面规划干部下放工作主要的方向应该是上山下乡
    会议要求，各机关对下放干部必须要有一个全面规划，必须有计划地分批下放干部到劳动战线和基层工作中轮流锻炼，要求在一定的时期内经过几番轮换下放，使机关干部得到全面的锻炼和改造。至于下放干部进行体力劳动锻炼的主要方向，应该是下乡上山，参加农业和林业劳动；其次是参加工业、手工业和其他劳动。
    其次，必须加强领导，深入细致地进行思想工作。会议认为，下放干部的工作是一项繁重复杂的思想工作和组织工作，不能采取简单粗糙的作法。会议批评了那种只满足于一次动员报告、然后来一个报名运动和敲锣打鼓、群众公议等简单化的作法，认为这样不能很好地解决干部的思想顾虑，相反，容易产生强迫命令的偏差。
    作好思想工作的重要一环，是发动群众提问题、摆困难、谈思想，展开大辩论，辩论得愈深入，群众得到的教育就会愈深刻。为了做到这一点，就需要很好地发动群众，消除顾虑，大胆鸣放，通过群众自我教育的方式广泛地展开讨论。
    此外，解决下放干部的实际困难和作好家属工作，也是思想工作的一个重要组成部分，必须以负责的精神切实做好。
    会议强调指出，广大干部从整风以来，政治觉悟有了很大的提高，过低地估计这种情况是不相信群众的表现。党的组织只要能够依靠群众认真地进行思想工作，反复地说明党的政策，他们就一定会自觉地积极地响应党的号召，愉快地参加劳动锻炼。
    一般整改告一段落的单位应及时转入干部下放工作
    习仲勋在讲话中号召各机关不要满足于整改的百分比，必须加一把劲把整风运动再向前推进一步。他说，当前的整风运动愈来愈深入，任务愈来愈繁重，问题愈来愈复杂，各机关既要整改，又要下放干部，有的鸣放不够还要补课。因此不要认为有了一些经验就松劲、骄傲，那样就会犯错误走弯路，因而就会推迟运动的发展。
    习仲勋说，进展较慢的单位必须要向先进单位看齐，要抓紧时机迎头赶上。他说，目前下放干部的形势很好，可是一般整改还没有进入高潮的单位，必须再用一把力，采取有效措施加速整改，否则腾不出手来就不要急于搞下放。
    习仲勋强调指出，在一般整改阶段遇到了千千万万的“小问题”，每一个领导者都不要忽视这些“小问题”，都不要眼高手低；小问题是大问题的根子，小问题成堆就成了大问题，彻底解决这些“小问题”，就有利于挖掉三个坏主义的根子。相反，忽视“小问题”就会出大问题，这是我们领导上所必须警惕的。
    习仲勋接着提出了当前整风运动中应该注意的四个问题：首先，要对一般整改切实进行检查。他说，有的机关为了造成整改的形势，他们勉强地去制造形势，满足于数目字，这是错误的。要知道百分比是一会事，实际情况又是一会事，应该检查是否真正改了？怎样改的？“小问题”是否解决了？要领导和群众结合进行检查，要求做一件是一件，坚决反对虚假。
    其次，要加强对整风运动的具体领导。对运动的领导没有决心不行，有了决心没有方法也不行。方法是从群众中来，不是我们脑子凭空想出来的。当然方法不能尽同，但是目的是一个，这就是为了又快又好地整改。
    第三、通过一般整改把大量的“小问题”大批解决，还要把大问题提出来，在下放干部的同时，就组织专组专人去研究，为下放以后的深入整改作准备，这样就可以使运动一步步地衔接起来。
    第四、凡是一般整改告一段落的单位，就应该及时转入下放干部的工作。下放干部的工作要充分地作好思想工作，下放的干部要辩论，不下放的干部也要参加辩论，这样可以互相进行教育。其次要作好安排工作，行政单位和事业单位要一起考虑，一起下放，不要等待。
    下放干部受到广大农民的欢迎  开始懂得党的干部政策的英明
    文化部、公安部和对外贸易部等单位的整风领导小组负责人，在会上介绍了关于下放干部工作的很多生动的经验。文化部和公安部都认真地贯彻了党的干部工作路线，抽出了一批优秀的干部下放锻炼，当两个机关下放干部的名单公布以后，给群众很大鼓舞，他们明白了领导上不是“甩包袱”，顾虑打消了。文化部在进行思想教育的过程中，通过提问题、摆困难、谈思想，然后展开大辩论，特别通过一些干部的现身说法，报告他们思想转变的过程，收到了良好的效果。
    对外贸易部副部长解学恭最近曾专程陪送下放干部到河北农村，会上他介绍了这些干部到达农村以后受到热烈欢迎的情况。许多县委书记和县长亲自替下放干部扛行李，介绍地方情况，许多房东老大娘几天以前便自动做好馒头热情地准备接待来自北京的客人，许多房东事先便打扫了住室，并且张贴了“欢迎某某同志下放参加劳动锻炼”的标语，这些情景都大大地感动了下放干部。这些情况出于许多下放干部的意料之外，他们一开始便由农民给上了最生动的一堂政治课，开始懂得了党的干部政策的英明、正确。
