　　Unite the Majority, Promote From Top to Bottom, Combine with Production
　　Rural Sichuan Universally Enters Rectification
　　(Our Newspaper News) A large-scale rectification upsurge has emerged in rural Sichuan. Of the more than 110,000 agricultural cooperatives, accounting for 61% of the province's total, having distinguished between the major issues of the two roads, they universally entered rectification in mid-November. Many areas first carried out Party and League rectification, and then entered cooperative rectification and rectification of cadre work style. By improving the relationship between the Party and the masses, solving specific problems in business management and mutually beneficial policies, the unity between Party members and the masses, cadres and the masses, and middle and poor peasants has been further strengthened. At the same time, combined with the study and discussion of the Agricultural Development Program, a debate on the two roads of developing production was launched, and a production upsurge was set off, thus making the vast rural areas present a scene of renewal.
　　Boldly mobilizing the masses, rectifying while releasing opinions, and rectifying while correcting are the main characteristics of this stage. During the airing of views, the masses in almost every township put forward thousands of criticisms and suggestions. Many cooperatives, with the Supervision Committee as the center, absorbed representatives of the masses and formed rectification teams to sort out, rank, investigate, and verify the opinions of the masses, and immediately solved those that could be resolved immediately. In the initial few days of airing views, more than 200 agricultural cooperatives in the Sixth District promptly corrected 5,800 of the 15,000 opinions raised by the masses, which not only promoted a more in-depth and thorough airing of views, but also strived to unite the majority, helping the masses to quickly draw a clear line, and greatly isolated anti-socialist elements, greatly shortening the time of the movement.
　　The second characteristic is to promote from top to bottom, encircle and suppress from left to right, and rectify comprehensively. For problems that the township cooperative grassroots organizations could not solve during the airing of views, as well as those involving leading organs and professional departments above the county level, after being sorted and summarized by the township branch, they were transferred to the County Rectification Committee. Then, under the unified leadership of the county party committee, each department combined with the rectification of organs to study and deal with the criticisms of the masses one by one. Many of these criticisms were issues that had not been touched upon in the past rectification of organs. These specific issues promoted the rectification work of the organs, making the connection between the leadership and the masses closer. The masses in Zaojiao Township, Shifang County, put forward 142 opinions on the county-level organs' extravagance and waste, production plans not being adapted to local conditions, inconsistent acceptance standards for purchases, lack of market management, rural stores' business hours violating farmers' habits, match factories producing matches not being fully filled, and the Women's Federation and the court neglecting the publicity of the Marriage Law. The rectification teams of the county-level units immediately convened special meetings to discuss and formulate improvement plans based on these criticisms. When farmers criticized queuing to buy meat in market towns, which delayed production time, the service department expanded and dispersed the supply points to agricultural cooperatives. These improvements were warmly welcomed by the masses. Because all organs seriously treated the criticisms of the masses and resolutely improved their work, it promoted the airing of views and rectification in the countryside.
　　Closely combining with production and vigorously launching an upsurge of rectification in various ways is the third characteristic of this stage. During the rectification, all localities combined with the discussion of the draft Agricultural Development Program to generally formulate production plans for 1958. After timely sowing more than 47 million mu of small spring crops such as wheat, rapeseed, and broad beans, the province launched an upsurge of winter manure accumulation, water conservancy construction, soil and water conservation, and soil improvement. In order to make rectification directly promote production, many places quickly announced the results of rectification to the masses through various forms such as big-character posters, blackboards, loudspeakers, and wired broadcasts. For some general problems, the county people's committees and relevant departments used the form of announcements to publicly express their willingness to humbly accept criticisms and publicly announce improvement methods. Some county party and government leaders also personally participated in township people's congresses and cooperative member meetings to directly make self-criticism to the masses and explain the relevant rectification issues, so that all the large and small opinions of the masses were "every matter has its outcome, and every item has its explanation." Of the 1,454 opinions raised by the masses in Yongfeng Township, Guanghan County, 1,400 have been corrected. Because each agricultural cooperative generally returned the members' farm tool rent, adjusted the price of pig manure, and changed the unreasonable system of transferring labor, the members' production enthusiasm was increased, more than 800 hogs were fattened in a month, and more than 1 million catties of fertilizer were accumulated in more than ten days.

### 团结多数　上下推动　结合生产  四川农村普遍进入整改

    团结多数　上下推动　结合生产
    四川农村普遍进入整改
    本报讯　大张旗鼓的整改热潮，已在四川农村出现。占全省农业合作社总数61％的十一万多个合作社，在分清两条道路大是大非的基础上，11月中旬普遍进入整改。许多地区首先进行了整党整团，然后再进入整社、整顿干部作风。通过改善党群关系、解决经营管理、互利政策等具体问题，使党员和群众、干部和群众以及中、贫农之间的团结更加增强了。与此同时，各地结合学习讨论农业发展纲要，展开发展生产的两条道路的争辩，制定生产计划，掀起生产高潮，从而使广大农村出现了万象更新的局面。
    放手发动群众，边放、边整、边改是这一阶段的主要特征。鸣放中，几乎每个乡的群众都提出了几千条批评建议的意见。许多社以监委为中心吸收群众代表，组成了整改小组，对群众意见进行整理排队和调查核对工作，凡能立即解决的马上加以解决。六区二百多个农业社在最初鸣放的几天中，对群众提出的一万五千条意见，及时改正了五千八百件，不仅推动鸣放更加深入透彻，而且，争取团结了多数，帮助群众迅速划清界限，使反社会主义分子很快孤立起来，大大缩短了运动的时间。
    第二个特点是上下推动、左右围攻、全面整改。对于鸣放中凡是乡社基层组织所不能解决的，以及涉及到县级以上领导机关和专业部门的问题，经过乡支部整理归纳后，转交县委整改委员会，然后，各部门在县委统一领导下，结合机关整风，逐条逐件研究处理群众的批评。这些批评，有许多都是过去机关整风中所没有涉及的问题。通过这些具体问题又推动了机关的整改工作，使领导和群众的联系更加密切。什邡县皂角乡群众对县级机关铺张浪费、生产计划不因地制宜、收购验收标准不一、市场缺乏管理、农村商店营业时间违背农民习惯、火柴厂出产火柴没有装满、妇联和法院忽视婚姻法宣传等，提出了一百四十二条意见。县级各单位的整风小组根据群众这些批评，马上召集专门会议讨论制订了改进方案。农民批评到集镇上买肉排队，太耽误生产时间，服务部门便把供应点扩大分散到农业社。这些改进都受到群众的热烈欢迎。由于各机关严肃对待群众批评，坚决改进工作，因而又推动了农村的鸣放和整改。
    紧密结合生产，大张旗鼓地采用各种方式掀起整改热潮，是这一阶段的第三个特点。整改中，各地结合讨论农业发展纲要草案，普遍制定了1958年的生产计划。全省在及时播种完四千七百多万亩小麦、油菜、葫豆等小春作物以后，掀起冬季积肥、兴修水利、保持水土、改良土壤的高潮。为使整改直接推动生产，不少地方通过大字报、黑板报、广播筒和有线广播等各种形式，向群众迅速公布整改成果。对于一些带有普遍性的问题，有的县人民委员会和有关方面，用出通告的形式，公开表示虚心接受批评，明文公布改进办法。有的县党政负责人还亲自参加乡人民代表大会和社员大会，直接向群众进行检讨，交代有关整改的问题，使群众的大小意见都做到“事事有着落，件件有交代。”广汉县永丰乡群众提的一千四百五十四条意见，已经改正了一千四百件。各农业社由于普遍归还了社员的农具租金，调整了猪粪价格，改变了不合理的调工制度，社员生产情绪提高，一个月增喂了八百只毛猪，十多天积了一百多万斤肥料。
