We Must Adhere to the General Line of Building Socialism with Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results

During the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, the Party Central Committee put forward the general line of developing the national economy with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. This line has played a huge positive role in China's socialist construction. The leaping development of China's national economy in 1956 proved that this line is completely correct, necessary, and effective.

The proposal of the general line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results was not accidental. First of all, we Communists have always been promoters of all progressive undertakings, and have always demanded that all progressive undertakings develop as much as needed and as quickly as possible. We promoted the people's democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, thereby opening up broad avenues for the development of our country's productive forces. Since the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan, we have concentrated our efforts on promoting China's socialist construction, so that China can complete the task of national industrialization and agricultural modernization as quickly as possible, and build China into a powerful socialist country. Obviously, this is of great significance not only for China itself, but also for strengthening the entire socialist camp and maintaining world peace. Secondly, it is also because our country is a country with a large population, little arable land, backward economy and culture, and a very weak foundation. To establish a strong socialist material base in such a country, to enable China's economic level to catch up with the advanced countries in the world in a few decades, and to greatly improve the people's living standards, the pace of construction must be faster and bigger, and the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, and the general line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results must be adopted. There is no other way to go.

Is it possible to realize the general line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results? The answer is absolutely affirmative. What was mentioned earlier, that China has a large population, little arable land, backward economy and culture, and a very weak foundation, is only one aspect of China's situation, which is the difficult side of our construction. We must also see the other side, the favorable side, and see that our country is a country with a large labor force, hardworking and brave people, vast territory, good natural conditions, and abundant resources. According to the estimated data during the First Five-Year Plan, China's hydropower resources alone have a reserves of more than 500 million kilowatts. The long-term iron reserves are about 12 billion tons, and the long-term coal reserves reach 1 trillion tons. Because of the vast territory, we can also reclaim wasteland, plant forests, develop mountainous areas, and do many, many things. In particular, we have a socialist political and economic system with great vitality, and the broad masses of working people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, are constantly improving their awareness and enthusiasm, and improving their labor productivity; at the same time, we also have the support of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. This can fully guarantee that we will build our country into a prosperous and powerful country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in a not-too-long period of time. Moreover, even the difficult side can be transformed into a force that stimulates our progress. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, under certain conditions, bad things can be turned into good things. One of the reasons why China was able to basically realize agricultural cooperativization nationwide in the short period of time from the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956 was that the vast majority of peasants were poor, and they realized that only by resolutely taking the socialist road could they get rid of poverty. All this shows that we have many favorable conditions for adopting the general line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and we must have sufficient estimates of this.

The practical results of the First Five-Year Plan proved that the general line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results is practical and feasible. According to the estimated completion figures for 1957, compared with 1952, China's total industrial and agricultural output value increased by 62%, of which industry increased by 132%, handicrafts increased by 66%, and agriculture and sideline production increased by 24%. In terms of the annual output of major products, it is expected that by the end of 1957, the power generation will reach more than 19 billion kilowatt-hours, which is 3.2 times the highest annual output before liberation; the output of raw coal will reach 128.37 million tons, which is close to 2.1 times the highest annual output before liberation; the output of steel will reach more than 5.24 million tons, which is almost 5.7 times the highest annual output before liberation; the grain will reach 370 billion jin, which exceeds the highest annual output before liberation by more than 90 billion jin; the cotton will reach 32.8 million dan, which is almost twice the highest annual output before liberation. In these five years, the output of many products exceeded the sum of the previous decades before liberation. Compared with the original First Five-Year Plan, it has overfulfilled in industry, agriculture, transportation, basic construction, and education.

However, this does not mean that there are no problems in our construction. Generally speaking, we are basically carrying out construction in accordance with the general line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. However, have we mobilized all positive factors, utilized all favorable conditions, brought into play all potential forces, and tried every means to implement the general line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results and building the country through diligence and thrift? It should be said that our efforts are still far from enough, and under the cover of the enthusiasm of the broad masses and cadres, there are still a few people with conservative ideas who are actually against this line.

In the period after last autumn, a wind blew up in some departments, some units, and some cadres, which actually blew away the general line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Some people said that the forty articles of the National Agricultural Development Program were too rash and unworkable; some people said that the national economic development plan for 1956 was all too rash, and even the First Five-Year Plan was too rash and went wrong; some people even said that it is better to make conservative mistakes than to make rash mistakes, and so on. As a result, things that should and could be done more and faster were done less, slower, or even not done at all. This practice, of course, cannot play a positive role in promoting socialist construction, but instead plays a negative role in "promoting regression."

Why did this conservative tendency arise among some cadres after last autumn? This is because they made a wrong estimate of the achievements and shortcomings of 1956. In 1956, China's industrial and agricultural production and basic construction had a great leap forward. On the one hand, this was the inevitable product of the unprecedented upsurge of enthusiasm of the broad masses and cadres in the upsurge of socialist transformation at that time. On the other hand, this was also a logical development after the accumulation of experience in the previous three years in production and basic construction, and after a lot of preparation work in all aspects. 1956 was the fourth year of the First Five-Year Plan, and in order to ensure the completion of the First Five-Year Plan, it was also necessary to have a leap forward in this year. In fact, the great leap forward on the economic front in 1956 did indeed powerfully guarantee the completion and over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan. In the leap forward in 1956, there were also some deviations: the investment in basic construction increased somewhat, the number of personnel in enterprises and institutions and students in universities and secondary technical schools increased somewhat, and the wages of some employees increased somewhat, which caused some tension in the supply of means of production and consumer goods. In addition, agriculture in 1956 suffered relatively serious natural disasters, and the state's reserve materials were reduced, which caused certain difficulties for the economic arrangement in the next year. However, generally speaking, the mainstream of 1956 was the great leap forward in the economy, and the upsurge of the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. However, some people do not see it this way. They only see the secondary deviation of the leap forward in 1956, and do not see the mainstream, so they think that they can no longer talk about more and faster in the future, and as long as they are more conservative, they will be "fully reliable" and will be able to live a good life. They misinterpreted the requirement of "fully reliable" and forgot that its premise should be to mobilize all positive factors and accelerate China's socialist construction, and only by mobilizing the strength of the masses from the positive side and bringing into play all the potential in production and construction can we overcome the various difficulties on our road forward. Their thinking is still stuck in the stage before the upsurge of the three major transformations, and they have not recognized the new situation after the basic completion of the three major transformations, and they have not fully estimated the greatly increased production potential under the new conditions, and as a result, they have deviated from the general line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and have become lazy people on the economic front.

Of course, in some cases, it is necessary and permissible to slow down the pace locally and temporarily, or even to make appropriate retreats. Taking the recent example, in 1957, we learned from the lessons of 1956, appropriately reduced some investment in basic construction, cut and eliminated some basic construction projects, adjusted the development speed of some departments, and carried out strict control in terms of labor wages. Doing so is precisely to better accumulate strength, not only to ensure the completion of the First Five-Year Plan, but also to prepare for the Second Five-Year Plan, especially the 1958 plan, so that we can move forward more, faster, better, and more economically in the future. The results of the implementation of the national plan in 1957 proved that this approach was completely necessary and correct.

Does advocating promotion and advocating greater, faster, better, and more economical results necessarily lead to blind adventurism? In whatever work we do, we have always opposed subjectivist practices; we oppose both conservativeism that follows old rules and adventurism that is rash and blind. The greater and faster we require is realistic and in line with the actual situation. Blind and subjectivist greater and faster cannot truly achieve the goal of greater and faster. That kind of practice cannot effectively promote construction, but will bring harm to it. For example, last year, due to the lack of specific analysis of the different needs of the south and north, mountainous areas and water areas, 1.8 million double-wheeled double-bottom plows and double-wheeled single-bottom plows were manufactured at once under the arrangement of the central and local governments, resulting in a backlog of nearly half of them. This kind of greater and faster has a subjectivist component. Those double-wheeled double-bottom plows and double-wheeled single-bottom plows that exceeded the needs did not play a role in promoting agricultural production, but instead accumulated funds and steel, and wasted labor and equipment capacity. Of course, due to lack of experience, it is impossible to fully understand the situation all at once, and it is impossible to completely avoid the mistakes of blind adventurism or blind conservatism in any specific work. The correct attitude should be to learn from these mistakes and move forward better, and should not use the excuse of greater and faster to engage in adventurism, or use the excuse of opposing adventurism to be conservative or even retrogressive.

Comrade Mao Zedong once said in the preface to "The Socialist Upsurge in the Chinese Countryside" written in December 1955: "People's thinking must adapt to the changed situation. Of course, no one can think wildly without basis, and cannot plan their actions beyond the conditions permitted by the objective situation, and should not reluctantly do things that are really impossible to do. But the problem now is that right-leaning conservative thinking is playing tricks in many aspects, making the work in many aspects unable to adapt to the development of the objective situation. The problem now is that there are many things that could have been done through efforts, but many people think that they cannot be done. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to constantly criticize the right-leaning conservative thinking that does exist." This passage is worth reading several times.

Greater, faster, better, and more economical results is an indivisible and complete general line of building the country through diligence and thrift. Construction must implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, running enterprises through diligence and thrift, running cooperatives through diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings through diligence and thrift, and must strive to increase production as needed and as possible, and strive to save funds in all aspects. For greater, faster, and better results, diligence is needed; for more economical results, frugality is needed. Greater and faster results are requirements for quantity and time, while better and more economical results are requirements for quality (including variety and specifications) and cost. With better and more economical results, the one-sided and blind pursuit of greater and faster results, the shoddy manufacturing and waste of funds are restricted, and at the same time, we are able to use the same resources and funds to carry out more production and construction, and make production and construction develop faster. It is wrong to only focus on quantity and only rush for time without regard to quality, variety, and cost; it is also wrong to only focus on quality, without regard to quantity and cost, and without paying attention to timely completion. In our construction, we must have both quantitative and timely growth, as well as improved quality, suitable varieties, and savings in funds. These two aspects restrict and promote each other. Therefore, we must always adhere to the complete general line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and resolutely oppose the erroneous tendency of neglecting any one of these aspects. Of course, it is also wrong to only focus on greater, faster, and more economical results, without regard to the safety of production and construction, causing industrial accidents and losses of manpower and materials, and it must also be resolutely opposed.

The four requirements of greater, faster, better, and more economical results are relative. What is considered greater, faster, better, and more economical must be considered uniformly based on the specific situation of the entire country in order to make a correct judgment. For example, sometimes building or expanding a factory may develop production from the perspective of a region or a department; however, it may unreasonably affect the full utilization of the equipment capacity of the original enterprises in other regions and other departments and the supply of raw materials and product sales, or affect more important construction projects, resulting in waste from the perspective of the whole country. Therefore, for each production and construction undertaking, we must start from the overall situation, carefully consider the needs and possibilities, raw materials and markets, the coordination and cooperation of various departments and regions, and the connection between the previous year and the next year, to ensure that all parts of the national economy develop proportionately and coordinately under the unified plan of the state. In construction, any localism that deviates from the whole is contrary to the realistic and practical general line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Construction should have priorities, distinguish between importance and urgency, and treat them differently, and cannot start everything at the same time in the same period. Mencius said well, "A person has things that he does not do, and then he can have things to do." The meaning is that only by not doing those things that should not be done, and doing less of those things that can be avoided, can we have the strength to do those main and necessary things. If everything is started at the same time, the result will be that nothing can be started. For example, water conservancy should focus on medium and small-sized projects, and only do a few large-scale water conservancy projects that are very possible and very necessary. In the steel industry, the focus of the First Five-Year Plan is to expand Anshan Iron and Steel, and in the Second Five-Year Plan, it will be possible to build Baotou Steel and Wuhan Steel, and at the same time, some medium-sized and small-sized steel plants should also be built. All work should be done in stages and batches. Without stages and batches, there will be no focus, it will be done badly, and it will not conform to the realistic and practical general line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

It is not easy for people's thinking to conform to reality. China has 600 million people, especially divided into different classes and strata, and various different views will inevitably be reflected in the thinking of our staff. Even senior leading cadres are in the tens of thousands, and although they generally stand on the position of the proletariat, they also have different experiences and positions, and different ideas. Moreover, socialist economic construction is still a new thing for all of us, and we still lack the necessary experience. Under these circumstances, it is of course not easy to require a unified plan that conforms to reality. But not easy does not mean impossible, it is possible. Have not our great revolutionary and construction undertakings achieved great success under a unified will and a unified plan? The transition from divergence to unity is achieved through investigation, research, debate, and most importantly, through the test of practice. Repeated research and repeated practice, this is our method.

Now, the First Five-Year Plan period is coming to an end. The Second Five-Year Plan is about to begin. During the First Five-Year Plan period, we have established a preliminary foundation for national industrialization, and we already have the conditions to promote the further development of industry, agriculture, and other economic undertakings. The broad masses and cadres have gained a lot of experience in various construction works, and the level of national economic planning and management has also been improved, which makes it possible for us to rely on the experience of the masses to do our work better and avoid making major mistakes in future construction. According to the regulations recently promulgated by the State Council, the national management system has been appropriately changed, and the enthusiasm of various localities, enterprises, and the broad masses will be further brought into play. In particular, through the rectification campaign of the whole Party and the socialist education of the whole people, the broad masses of cadres and masses have raised their political awareness, overcome the mistakes and shortcomings in their work, subjectivism will be greatly reduced, and will directly promote the development of the socialist cause. At present, under the promotion of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), a high tide of farmland water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation has been set off in rural areas, and the industrial sector is also moving towards a new upsurge. Leading cadres at all levels on the economic front should pay attention to this opportunity and step up preparations in all aspects of economic work. The important task at present is to make the various planning indicators for 1958 as advanced as possible on a fully reliable basis, and to do a corresponding good job in balancing and scheduling raw materials, markets, and other aspects. In order to better tap the potential of enterprises and strengthen the coordination and cooperation between enterprises, the Party organizations in various localities should actively lead the various enterprises in their respective regions (including the enterprises under the jurisdiction of various ministries of the central government) to prepare their plans well. If our efforts can keep up with the national-scale high tide of industrial and agricultural production in all aspects of economic work, and implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, then we can lay a good foundation for the Second Five-Year Plan, so as to promote our country's socialist construction cause more, faster, better, and more economically.

### 必须坚持多快好省的建设方针

　　必须坚持多快好省的建设方针
    在执行第一个五年计划的过程中，党中央提出了又多、又快、又好、又省的发展国民经济的方针。这个方针对于我国的社会主义建设事业起了巨大的积极作用。1956年我国国民经济的跃进的发展，证明这个方针是完全正确的、必需的和行之有效的。
    多快好省方针的提出并不是出于偶然。首先，我们共产党人对于一切前进的事业历来就是促进派，历来就要求一切前进事业按照需要和可能多多地发展，快快地发展。我们促进了人民民主革命，促进了社会主义革命，从而给我国生产力的发展开辟了广阔的道路。从第一个五年计划开始，我们又集中力量来促进我国的社会主义建设事业，使我国尽可能迅速地完成国家工业化和农业现代化的任务，把我国建成为一个社会主义强国。很明显，这不但对于我国本身有极大的意义，而且对于加强整个社会主义阵营，对于维护全世界的和平，都有极大的意义。其次，还因为我国是一个人口多、耕地少、经济文化落后、底子很薄的国家。要在这样一个国家里建立起强大的社会主义物质基础，使我国的经济水平在几十年内赶上世界上的先进国家，使人民生活得到很大的改善，建设的步子就必须迈得比较快、比较大，就必须采取勤俭建国的方针，采取又多又快又好又省的建设方针。除此以外的道路是走不通的。
    实现多快好省的方针，有没有可能呢？回答是完全肯定的。前面所说我国人口多、耕地少、经济文化落后、底子很薄，只是我国情况的一个方面，是我们建设的困难的一面。我们还必须看到另一面，即有利的一面，看到我们的国家是一个劳动力多、人民勤劳勇敢、幅员广大、自然条件良好、资源丰富的国家。根据第一个五年计划期间估算的资料，我国单是水力资源，就有五亿瓩以上的蕴藏量。铁的远景储量约有一百二十亿吨，煤的远景储量达一万亿吨。因为幅员广大，我们还可以垦荒植林、开发山区，做很多很多的事情。特别是我们有一个具有伟大生命力的社会主义政治制度和经济制度，广大的劳动群众在共产党的领导下不断地提高自己的觉悟性和积极性，提高自己的劳动生产率；同时，我们还有以苏联为首的社会主义各国的支援。这就完全能够保证我们在不太长的时间内把我国建设成为一个有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的富裕、强大的国家。而且，就是困难的那一面，也可以转化成为刺激我们前进的力量。正如毛泽东同志所说，在一定的条件下，坏事可以转变成为好事。我国所以能够在1955年冬天到1956年春天这个短短的时间内在全国范围内基本上实现了农业合作化，原因之一就是绝大多数的农民穷，农民看清了只有坚决走社会主义道路，才能摆脱穷困的境遇。这些都说明，我们采取多快好省的方针有很多有利条件，对此我们必须有足够的估计。
    第一个五年计划的实践结果，证明了多快好省的方针是切实可行的。按照1957年的预计完成数字，同1952年比较，我国的工农业总产值增长62％，其中工业增长132％，手工业增长66％，农业和副业增长24％。以主要产品的年产量说，预计到1957年底，发电量达到一百九十亿度以上，等于解放前最高年产量的三点二倍；原煤产量达到一亿二千八百三十七万吨，接近解放前最高年产量的二点一倍；钢产量达到五百二十四万多吨，差不多等于解放前最高年产量的五点七倍；粮食达到三千七百亿斤，超过解放前的最高年产量九百多亿斤；棉花达到三千二百八十万担，差不多等于解放前最高年产量的二倍。在这五年当中，许多产品的产量超过了解放前几十年的总和。同原订的第一个五年计划相比，在工业、农业、交通运输、基本建设、教育事业等方面都超额完成了。
    但是，这并不是说在我们的建设事业中就没有问题了。总的说来，我们基本上是按照多快好省的方针进行建设的。但是，是不是已经动员了一切积极因素，利用了一切有利条件，发挥了一切潜在力量，想尽了一切办法来贯彻执行多快好省、勤俭建国的方针呢？应当说，我们的努力还是很不够的，而且在广大群众和干部的积极性的掩盖下，还有少数有保守思想的人实际上在反对这个方针。
    在去年秋天以后的一段时间里，在某些部门、某些单位、某些干部中间刮起了一股风，居然把多快好省的方针刮掉了。有的人说，农业发展纲要四十条订得冒进了，行不通；有的人说，1956年的国民经济发展计划全部冒进了，甚至第一个五年计划也冒进了，搞错了；有的人竟说，宁可犯保守的错误，也不要犯冒进的错误，等等。于是，本来应该和可以多办、快办的事情，也少办、慢办甚至不办了。这种做法，对社会主义建设事业当然不能起积极的促进的作用，相反地起了消极的“促退”的作用。
    为什么去年秋天以后，在部分干部中间产生了这种保守的倾向呢？这是因为，他们对1956年的成绩和缺点作了错误的估计。1956年，我国的工农业生产和基本建设有一个很大的跃进。从一方面说，这是当时社会主义改造高潮中广大群众和干部的积极性空前高涨的必然产物。从另一方面说，这又是在生产和基本建设上有了前三年的经验积累，有了各方面的大量准备工作之后的一个合乎逻辑的发展。1956年是第一个五年计划的第四年，为了保证完成第一个五年计划，在这一年来个跃进也是必要的。事实上，1956年经济战线上的大跃进，确实有力地保证了第一个五年计划的完成和超额完成。在1956年的跃进当中，也发生了某些偏差：基本建设投资多了些，企业、机关的人员和高等学校、中等技术学校的学生招收得多了些，一部分职工的工资增加得多了些，因此引起了生产资料和消费资料供应的某些紧张。加以1956年的农业遭受了比较严重的灾荒，而国家的储备物资又有了减少，对下一年度的经济安排造成了一定的困难。但是，总的说来，1956年的主流是经济上的大跃进，是群众的积极性和创造性的高潮。然而，有些人却不这样看。他们只看到1956年跃进中的次要的偏差的一方面，而没有看到主流，因而以为今后再不能讲多和快，只要保守一些，就是“充分可靠”，就好过日子了。他们曲解了“充分可靠”的要求，忘记了它的前提应该是调动一切积极因素，加速我国的社会主义建设，而且也只有从积极方面调动群众的力量，发挥生产和建设中的一切潜力，才能克服我们前进道路上的各种困难。他们的思想仍然停留在三大改造高潮以前的阶段，而没有认识三大改造基本完成后的新形势，没有充分估计在新条件下大大增长了的生产潜力，结果就背离了多快好省的方针，变成了经济战线上的懒汉。
    当然，在某种情况下，局部地、暂时地放慢步子，甚至作适当的后退，是必要的和容许的。拿最近的例子来说，在1957年，我们就接受1956年的教训，适当减少了一些基本建设投资，削减和削除了一部分基本建设项目，调整了某些部门的发展速度，在劳动工资方面进行了严格的控制。这样做，正是为了更好地积聚力量，不仅保证第一个五年计划的完成，而且为第二个五年计划首先是1958年的计划作好准备，使今后能够更多更快更好更省地前进。1957年国家计划执行的结果，证明了这样作是完全必要的，正确的。
    主张促进，提倡多快好省，是不是就一定会盲目冒进呢？不论做什么工作，我们历来反对主观主义的做法；既反对因循旧规的保守主义，也反对急躁盲目的冒险主义。我们所要求的多和快，是实事求是的、合乎实际情况的多和快。盲目的、主观主义的多和快，并不能真正达到多和快的目的。那种做法，不但不能有效地促进建设事业，反而会给它带来损害。例如去年，由于对南方北方、山地水地的不同需要没有作具体的分析，在中央和地方的布置下一下子制造了一百八十万部双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁，以至积压了差不多一半。像这样的多和快，就带有主观主义成分。那些超过了需要的双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁没有起促进农业生产的作用，反而积压了资金和钢材，浪费了人工和设备能力。当然，由于经验不足，对情况不能一下子摸得很清楚，要求在任何具体工作中完全避免盲目冒进或者盲目保守的错误，也是不可能的。正确的态度应当是从这些错误中吸取教训，更好地前进，而不应当借口多和快而冒进，或者借口反对冒进而保守甚至冒退。
    毛泽东同志在1955年12月写的“中国农村的社会主义高潮”序言中曾经这样说：“人们的思想必须适应已经变化了的情况。当然，任何人不可以无根据地胡思乱想，不可以超越客观情况所许可的条件去计划自己的行动，不要勉强地去做那些实在做不到的事情。但是现在的问题，还是右倾保守思想在许多方面作怪，使许多方面的工作不能适应客观情况的发展。现在的问题是经过努力本来可以做到的事情，却有很多人认为做不到。因此，不断地批判那些确实存在的右倾保守思想，就有完全的必要了。”这一段话，值得我们再读几遍。
    多、快、好、省，这是一个不可分割的完整的勤俭建国的方针。建设必须贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办合作社、勤俭办一切事业的方针，必须按照需要和可能力求增产，并且在一切方面力求节约资金。为了多、快、好，这就需要勤；为了省，这就需要俭。多和快是对数量和时间的要求，好和省是对质量（包括品种、规格）和成本的要求。有了好和省，就限制了片面的盲目的多和快，限制了粗制滥造和浪费资金，同时也就使我们有可能用同样的资源和资金，进行更多的生产和建设，使生产和建设发展得更快。只顾追数量，只顾赶时间而不顾质量、品种和成本，是错误的；只顾质量，不顾数量不顾成本，不注意按时完成，也是错误的。我们在建设中，既要有按量按时的增长，也要有质量的提高、品种的适合需要和资金的节约。这两个方面，互相制约，互相推进。因此，我们必须经常坚持完整的多快好省的方针，坚决反对忽视其中任何一个方面的错误倾向。当然，只顾多、快和省，而不顾生产和建设的安全，造成工伤事故和人力物力的损失，同样是错误的，同样也必须坚决反对。
    多快好省这四个要求，是相对的。怎样算做多快好省，要根据整个国家的具体情况统一考虑，才能做出正确的判断。例如，有时新建或扩建一个工厂，从一个地区一个部门来看是发展了生产；但是可能因此不合理地影响了其他地区其他部门原有企业的设备能力的充分利用以及原料供应和产品销售，或者影响了更重要的建设工程，从全国来看，反而造成了浪费。因此，我们对每一项生产建设事业，都必须从全局出发，周密考虑需要和可能，原料和市场，各部门各地区的协作配合，以及上一年度和下一年度的衔接，以保证国民经济的各个部分在国家统一的计划下按比例地协调地全面地发展。在建设当中，任何脱离整体的本位主义思想，是同实事求是的、合乎实际的多快好省的方针相违背的。
    建设要有重点，要分清轻重缓急，区别对待，不能在同一时期内百废俱兴。孟子说得好，“人有不为也，而后可以有为。”意思是说，只有不作那些不该作的事，少作那些可以不作的事，才有力量去做那主要的、必须作的事。同时百废俱兴，结果会俱不能兴。例如水利要着重中小型，只办若干极可能又极必需的大型水利工程。钢铁业第一个五年重点在扩建鞍钢，第二个五年就有可能建设包钢、武钢，同时还要办一些中型的和小型的钢铁厂。各项工作要分期分批办。不分期不分批，就是无重点，就会办坏，也就不符合实事求是的、合乎实际的多快好省的方针。
    人的思想要符合实际是不容易的。我国有六亿几千万人，特别是分成不同的阶级和阶层，各种不同的观点不可避免地会反映在我们的工作人员的思想中。就是高级领导干部也是以成万计，他们虽然一般是站在无产阶级的立场上，但是也各有不同的经历和岗位，各有不同的想法。而且社会主义的经济建设，对于我们大家都还是一件新事，还缺少必要的经验。在这种情况下，要求一个统一的符合实际的计划，当然不容易。但是不容易并不等于不能够，这是能够办到的。我们的伟大的革命事业和建设事业不是都在一个统一意志和统一计划之下取得了伟大的成功吗？由分歧到统一，是经过调查，经过研究，经过辩论，最重要的是经过实践的考验来达到的。反复研究和反复实践，这就是我们的方法。
    现在，第一个五年计划时期快要结束。第二个五年计划就要开始了。我们在第一个五年计划期内，已经建立起国家工业化的初步基础，已经有条件促进工业、农业和其他各种经济事业的进一步发展。广大群众和干部在各项建设工作中取得了许多经验，国民经济计划水平和管理水平也有了提高，这就使我们有可能在今后的建设中能够依靠群众的经验把工作做得更好一些，避免犯大的错误。根据国务院最近公布的规定，国家的管理体制已有适当的改变，各地方、各企业和广大群众的积极性，将得到进一步的发挥。特别是经过全党整风和全民的社会主义教育，广大干部和群众提高了政治觉悟，克服了工作中的错误和缺点，主观主义将大为减少，就更将直接促进社会主义事业的发展。目前，在全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的推动下，农村中已经掀起了一个兴修农田水利和积肥的高潮，工业方面也正在走向新的高涨，经济战线上的各级领导干部，要注意这个时机，在经济工作的各个方面加紧进行准备。当前的重要任务，就是要在充分可靠的基础上，把1958年的各项计划指标订得尽可能先进些，并且相应地做好原料、市场等各个方面的平衡调度工作。为了更好地发掘企业的潜力和加强企业之间的配合协作，各个地方的党组织要积极领导所在地区各个企业（包括中央各部所管的企业）编好计划。如果我们努力的结果，在经济工作的各个方面都能够跟上全国规模的工农业生产高潮，贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针，那么，我们就可以为第二个五年计划打下良好的基础，从而把我国的社会主义建设事业更多、更快、更好、更省地大大向前推进一步。
