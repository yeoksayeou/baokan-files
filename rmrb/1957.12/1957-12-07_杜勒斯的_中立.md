Dulles' "Neutrality"
    When the United States abstained from voting in the UN on the West Irian issue, it once again abstained. Dulles glorified this action as "neutrality." But Dulles knew very well what the United States' "neutral" attitude meant. The United States manipulates the majority of the United Nations, and its abstention can guarantee that the Netherlands receives the necessary vetoes, just like voting.
    People remember how much Dulles hated neutrality. He insulted neutralism as "immoral" twice last summer. He even insisted on this statement after being widely criticized. He said that neutralism is immoral because it "doesn't care about the fate of others." When a reporter asked, "How is that expressed internationally?" Dulles happened to remember the United Nations at this time, and he said, "I would say, first of all, it is expressed through UN membership. Membership itself binds all member states to abide by the principle of opposing aggression. This shows concern for others." According to this, Dulles respects the principle of opposing aggression so much, and he cares so much about other people's just actions against aggression.
    However, it is precisely in the United Nations, and on the West Irian issue of resisting aggression, that Dulles has become a "neutralist."
    How can the brazen Dulles find a temporary shelter for the United States to support the Dutch aggressors in the word "neutrality"? Dulles is a standard chameleon. He clumsily argued that the arguments of both Indonesia and the Netherlands were "almost evenly matched," so that he "could not see" which side he should support. This means that Indonesia's argument for reclaiming its territory of West Irian is not worthy of American support. On this issue of anti-aggression, the principle of resisting aggression is not applicable.
    The American bourgeois newspapers made appropriate notes on Dulles' true intentions. The title of an editorial in the "Washington Post" was simply: "Let us support the Dutch." Because, as "New York Times" reporter James Reston admitted, "the United States has many interests" that are "inconsistent with" Indonesia's interests.
    Therefore, the United States' "neutrality" on the West Irian issue is not contradictory to its curse of the peaceful neutrality policies of nationally independent countries (including Indonesia). If there is any contradiction, it is only in the fact that the United States' curse of neutralism is true, and its "neutrality" on the West Irian issue is false. The reason why Dulles wants to use the name of neutrality to cover up the neo-colonialist face of the United States is because he does not have the courage to face the anti-colonialist wave.

### 杜勒斯的“中立”

　　杜勒斯的“中立”
    美国在联大表决西伊里安问题的时候，再度弃权。杜勒斯把这个行动美其名曰“中立”。但杜勒斯很清楚，美国采取“中立”态度是意味着什么。美国操纵着联合国的多数，它的弃权可以同投票一样保证使荷兰得到必要的否决票数。
    人们记得，杜勒斯是多么憎恨中立的。他在去年夏天曾经两次辱骂中立主义“不道德”。他甚至在受到广泛的斥责之后，仍然坚持这种说法。他说中立主义之所以不道德，是因为它“不关心别人的命运”，当记者问道：“那在国际方面是如何表现的呢？”杜勒斯恰好在这时记起了联合国，他说：“我愿意说，首先是通过联合国会籍表现出来，会员籍本身约束所有的会员国要遵守一道对抗侵略的原则。这表示出对别人的关心”。照这样说来，杜勒斯是多么尊重对抗侵略的原则，又是多么关心别人反对侵略的正义行动的。
    但是，正是在联合国，又是在对抗侵略的西伊里安问题上，杜勒斯却成了“中立”主义者了。
    大言不惭的杜勒斯，怎么能够从“中立”的字眼中找到美国支持荷兰侵略者的临时避难所的呢？杜勒斯是标准的变色蜥蜴。他拙劣地辩解说，印度尼西亚和荷兰双方的论点“几乎势均力敌”，以致使他“看不出”应该支持哪一方。这就是说，印度尼西亚要求收回自己的领土西伊里安的论据是博不到美国的支持的。在这个反侵略的问题上，对抗侵略的原则是不适用的。
    美国资产阶级报纸倒是替杜勒斯的真实意图作了恰切的注解。“华盛顿邮报”有一篇社论的题目干脆就是：“让我们支持荷兰人”。因为，正如“纽约时报”记者詹姆斯·赖斯顿所承认的，“美国有许多利益”是和印度尼西亚的利益“相矛盾的”。
    因此，美国在西伊里安问题上的“中立”，同它咒骂民族独立国家（印度尼西亚在内）的和平中立政策，并没有什么矛盾。如果有什么矛盾的话，只是在于：美国咒骂中立主义是真的，它在西伊里安问题上的“中立”是虚伪的。杜勒斯所以要假借中立之名来掩盖美国的新殖民主义面目，是因为他在反殖民主义浪潮面前并不是有勇气的。
