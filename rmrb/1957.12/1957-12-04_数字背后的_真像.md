　　The "Truth" Behind the Numbers

　　During the third stage of the rectification campaign at the Ministry of Higher Education, it is said that seventeen department directors participated in the blooming and contending. How did they bloom and contend? One department director gave a few opening remarks while presiding over a blooming and contending symposium in his unit, and this was considered "blooming and contending." Another department director signed a big-character poster, signed by several people, supporting the transfer of cadres to lower levels, and this was also considered "blooming and contending." And so on. Of course, some department directors did offer criticisms of the three major isms.

　　In evaluating the blooming and contending situation of a certain unit, the number of people who participated in the blooming and contending is a basis, because it can show the breadth. However, it is not enough to look only at the numbers, because there may be false appearances. Therefore, it is also necessary to look at the depth, to look at the content of the blooming and contending, to see whether major problems have been exposed, and whether the three major isms have been exposed by the masses without any hesitation.

　　Blooming and contending is like this, and rectification is also like this. The number of things rectified is a standard, and the content of the rectification is also a standard. If the numbers are not small, but some things that should be rectified have not been rectified, then this cannot be considered a good rectification. It is even worse if it seems to be rectified on the surface but not actually rectified in reality.

　　We need both quantity and quality. Numbers are important, but content is even more important. Otherwise, blindly pursuing numbers without regard to content will make one a lover of formalism.

　  数字背后的“真像”
    高教部在整风第三阶段，据说有十七位司长参加了鸣放。怎样鸣放的呢？一位司长在主持本单位鸣放座谈会时，说了几句开会词，这就算“鸣放”了；另一位司长在一张有若干人签名的拥护干部下放的大字报上签了名，这也算“鸣放”了。诸如此类。当然，也有些司长确乎对三大主义提出了批评意见。
    在评价某一个单位鸣放情况的时候，多少人参加鸣放的数字是一种根据，因为可以从这里看到广度。但是，仅看数字是不够的，因为其中可能有假象，因此也需要看深度，看鸣放的内容，看重大问题是否揭露了，三大主义是否已经受到群众毫无顾虑的揭发。
    鸣放如此，整改也如此。改的数字多少是一种标准，改的内容也是一种标准。数字不小，但有些应改的而未改，这也不能算改得好，表面看来是改了实际并未改，就更不好。
  要数量也要质量。数字重要，内容更重要。否则，一味追求数字而不顾内容，就会成为形式主义的爱好者。
