Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: According to reports from the New China News Agency, some American newspapers, in commenting on the report by U.S. President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles on the NATO Paris conference on the 23rd, expressed strong dissatisfaction and demanded Dulles' resignation.

The "New York Post" published an editorial entitled "Why Dulles Should Resign?" stating: Every listener in any corner of the world will understand that Dulles treats "all of us as if we were children who cannot distinguish between truth and falsehood." The editorial said, "People on both sides of the Iron Curtain distrust him," and "his resignation is necessary to restore some effective diplomacy in the free world." "This brazen Philadelphia lawyer should not try to dress himself up as a global statesman." The editorial said, "In one respect, Dulles has played a new trick, pretending that he has always known that 'brinkmanship' is a terrible international policy," but he is actually "the schemer of the Western world." "Although he played a momentary tune of peace, he used a lot of words to depict the unreliability of negotiations and the stubbornness of the enemy."

The "New York Post" pointed out that in order to confuse public opinion, "Dulles also avoided mentioning two points: first, the Russians proposed a rapid international ban on hydrogen bomb testing; second, they advocated a summit meeting with Eisenhower." The editorial said, "Judging from the many failures suffered by the United States on a broad front, both Eisenhower and Dulles have a lot to leave unsaid. However, what Dulles has said shows that as long as he remains in this position, the United States will undoubtedly not be able to restore its prominent position in the world and will not be able to gain trust."

The "New York World-Telegram and Sun" editorial said, "Eisenhower and Dulles's boastful report is largely a failure. They overlooked two facts – that the Europeans are unwilling to agree to the deployment of rockets on their territory and that the Europeans want to hold new talks with the Russians, despite strong American opposition." The newspaper pointed out that from the actions of Dulles and Eisenhower, it seems as if they did not hear the speeches of Gromyko and Khrushchev on December 21, which resolutely rejected NATO's compromise proposal to hold a new foreign minister-level meeting with the Russians.

The "Chicago Daily News" published a dispatch from its reporter Hill from London, saying, "Britain fears Dulles will lead the world to war." The British believe Dulles is a "war-loving man." Hill wrote that distrust of Dulles is growing, mainly because he opposes all peaceful negotiations with the Russians and intends to drag the world into a war. Hill said, "In the eyes of the British, Dulles is a symbol of such characteristics: bellicose, stubborn, obsessed with revenge, empty threats, fond of brinkmanship, considering negotiations futile because of clinging to outdated views, arrogant, and shockingly lacking in humanity and humility." Hill emphasized that both the Conservative Party and the Labour Party have a "spirit of resistance," and they do not want Dulles or anyone else to turn them into fixed targets for rockets. "They demand negotiations with the Russians, but not the kind of Dulles-style negotiations they distrust."

The American "United Mine Workers Journal" recently published an editorial stating that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles is unpopular and must step down. The editorial said: "We don't want to keep saying this, but Dulles should step down." It pointed out that Dulles "is probably the least suitable person to have ever held such an important position."

The newspaper also published a limerick satirizing the leaders of the United States, saying:

"Sputnik, Sputnik in the sky
"Beep-beep rising high,
"In your shell-nik,
"Is there room for
Ike, Dick and Foster Dulles-nik to lie?"

(Sputnik is the Russian transliteration of the Soviet artificial satellite, Ike refers to Eisenhower, Dick refers to Vice President Nixon, and Dulles' full name is John Foster Dulles)

    美国舆论不满总统和国务卿的双簧
    杜勒斯成了众矢之的
    许多报纸都主张杜勒斯应该下台
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国一些报纸在评论美国总统艾森豪威尔和国务卿杜勒斯23日关于北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议的报告时表示强烈的不满，并且要求杜勒斯辞职。
    “纽约邮报”以“为什么杜勒斯应该下台？”为题发表社论说：世界任何角落的每个听众都会明白，杜勒斯把“我们大家看成好像同分不出真假虚实的小孩子一般”。社论说，“铁幕两边的人都不信任他”，“他的辞职是恢复自由世界某种有效外交所必需的”。“这一个厚颜无耻的费城律师不该硬把自己打扮成一个世界范围的国家活动家。”社论说，“在某一方面来说，杜勒斯倒耍了新的花招，装作他一向就知道‘剑拔弩张’是一种糟糕的国际政策”，可是他实际上却是“西方世界的权谋家”。“虽然他弹了一刹那的和平调子，可是他却用大量言词来描绘谈判不可靠和敌人顽固不化。”
    “纽约邮报”指出，为了迷惑舆论，“杜勒斯还对这样两点避而不谈：一、俄国人建议迅速在国际范围内禁止试验氢弹，第二，他们主张同艾森豪威尔举行高级会议。”社论说，“从美国在广泛的战线上遭到的许多失败这一点来看，无论是艾森豪威尔还是杜勒斯，都有许多东西没有讲到。但是，杜勒斯所讲的东西表明，只要他还留在这个职位上，那末无疑美国就不可能恢复在世界上的卓越地位，不可能获得信任。”
    “纽约世界电讯与太阳报”的社论说，“艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯的大吹大擂的报告在很大的程度上是一个失败。他们忽视了两个事实——欧洲人不愿意同意在他们的领土上配置火箭以及欧洲人希望同俄国人举行新的会谈，尽管美国人坚决反对。”这家报纸指出，从杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔的行动看来，好像他们没有听见葛罗米柯和赫鲁晓夫12月21日的发言一样，这两个发言断然拒绝了北大西洋公约组织关于同俄国人举行新的外交部长级会议的折衷建议。
    “芝加哥每日新闻”发表了它的记者希耳自伦敦发出的一篇通讯说，“英国担心杜勒斯会把世界引向战争”，英国人认为杜勒斯是一个“喜欢战争的人”。希耳写道，不信任杜勒斯的情绪越来越增长了，主要是认为他反对同俄国人进行一切和平谈判，认为他打算把世界拖入一场战争。希耳说，“在英国人的眼中，杜勒斯是这样一些性格的象征：好战，固执，一心想报复打击，虚声恫吓，喜欢濒于战争边缘，由于死守着陈旧的观点而认为谈判徒劳无益，自高自大，令人吃惊地缺乏人道和谦虚”。希耳着重指出，不论是保守党或是工党都具有一种“反抗情绪”，他们不想叫杜勒斯或其他别的人把他们变成火箭的固定靶子。“他们要求同俄国人谈判，不过不是他们所不信任的那种杜勒斯式的谈判”。
    美国“联合煤矿工人报”最近刊载一篇社论，认为美国国务卿杜勒斯不得人心，必须下台。社论说：“我们不想老是这么说，但是杜勒斯该下台了。”它指出，杜勒斯“大概是担任过一项重要职务的人中最不适合的人物”。
    这家报纸还刊载了一首打油诗，讽刺美国的首脑人物说：
    “斯普特尼克，斯普特尼克在天空
    “噼卜噼卜地往上升，
    “在你的壳儿尼克中，
    “可有地方给
    艾克、狄克和福斯特·杜勒尼克容身？”
    （斯普特尼克是苏联人造地球卫星的俄文译音，艾克是指艾森豪威尔，狄克是指副总统尼克松，杜勒斯的全名是约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯）
