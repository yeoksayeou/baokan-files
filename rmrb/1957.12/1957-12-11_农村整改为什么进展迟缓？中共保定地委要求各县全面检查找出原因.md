Why is the Rural Rectification Progressing Slowly?
The Baoding Prefectural Committee of the CPC Demands Comprehensive Inspection by All Counties to Find the Reasons

(Our report) On December 4th, the Baoding Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Hebei Province convened a telephone conference attended by the county party secretaries of each county, communicating the Prefectural Committee's opinions on further strengthening the leadership of the rural rectification and socialist education movement.

The rural rectification and socialist education movement in the Baoding area has achieved great success thanks to the importance attached to it by party committees at all levels and the efforts of all party members and cadres. However, since the "Three Autumns" work, especially since the launch of the water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation campaign, the progress of the rectification and socialist education movement has been slow. Of the more than 1,800 co-ops in the district that started rectification in the first batch, one-third were still in the "airing views" stage by the end of November, some of which were half-stopped, half-moving, or even completely stalled. The quality of those who have entered the debate stage is also not high, and many areas one-sidedly emphasize debating whatever they are doing, discussing things as they are. The integration of the rectification movement with the production movement is also very insufficient. Some party committees, especially township party committees and grassroots party organizations, do not fully understand the great significance of carrying out rural rectification and socialist education movement, and regard the rectification movement as being in opposition to the production movement. Some township party secretaries said: "Leading the water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation campaign is already overwhelming, and now we have to carry out the rectification movement!" Others said: "Let's carry out the rectification movement after we start the water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation campaign!"

The Prefectural Committee believes that if leadership is not strengthened quickly and effective measures are not taken to solve the above-mentioned problems, it will not only hinder the further in-depth development of the rectification movement, but will also seriously affect the smooth development of the water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation campaign and the realization of the great leap forward in production next year. To this end, the Prefectural Committee put forward the following measures:

First, party committees at all levels, especially county party committees, must seriously conduct a comprehensive inspection of the previous stage of the rectification movement, summarize experience, find out the reasons for the slow progress and problems that have occurred, and take specific and effective measures to solve them quickly in response to the existing problems.

Second, the Prefectural Committee requires party committees at all levels to complete the first batch of co-ops carrying out rural rectification and socialist education movement before the end of December, and the second batch before the Spring Festival, on the premise of ensuring quality. Before the end of the first batch, all localities should make arrangements and preparations for the second batch. At the same time, all co-ops that are still in the airing views stage should quickly move into rectification, and fiercely burn the three isms. In the rectification, continue to mobilize the masses to air their views freely and conduct big debates. Those who are currently conducting debates should continue to do so if they are good, and those who are not good should also move into rectification, and mobilize the masses to carry out debates from the rectification.

Third, in order to complete the tasks of rural rectification and socialist education on time, with quality and quantity, party committees at all levels must solve the following problems in their guiding ideology: First, the rectification movement must be closely integrated with the production movement, and both must be done simultaneously. To this end, all rural cadres, without exception, must take on two jobs, both leading the current water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation and other production movements, and leading the masses in airing their views freely and conducting big debates. The cadres in charge of the first batch of rectification should be fixed, and in addition to doing a good job in rectification, they should take charge of production work, and through the rectification of the party and the co-op and the nationwide rectification, a upsurge in production should be set off. Second, we must conscientiously overcome right-leaning thoughts, boldly change, resolutely change, and thoroughly change. Third, we must overcome the slackness, complacency, and half-heartedness that currently exist in some party committees and party member cadres.

　　农村整改为什么进展迟缓？
　　中共保定地委要求各县全面检查找出原因
    本报讯　12月4日，中共河北省保定地委召开了各县县委书记参加的电话会议，传达地委关于进一步加强农村整风和社会主义教育运动的领导的意见。
    保定地区的农村整风和社会主义教育运动，由于各级党委的重视和全体党员干部的努力，已取得很大成绩。但自“三秋”工作以后，特别是开展水利积肥运动以来，整风和社会主义教育运动进展是迟缓的。全区第一批开展整风的一千八百多个社，到11月底仍有三分之一处于鸣放阶段，其中一部分是半停半动，甚至全部停顿了下来。已进入辩论的，质量也不高，不少地区片面地强调干什么辩论什么，就事论事。整风运动与生产运动结合的也很不够。部分党委特别是乡党委和基层党组织，对于开展农村整风和社会主义教育运动的重大意义领会不够，将整风运动与生产运动对立起来。有的乡党委书记说：“领导水利积肥运动就够呛了，还搞整风运动！”也有的说：“等搞起水利积肥运动再搞整风运动吧！”
    地委认为，如不迅速加强领导，采取有效措施解决上述问题，不仅障碍着整风运动进一步深入地开展，而且也必然将严重影响水利积肥运动的顺利开展和明年生产大跃进的实现。为此地委提出如下措施：
    第一，各级党委首先是县委要认真对前段整风运动进行一次全面的检查，总结经验，找出进度迟缓和发生问题的原因，针对存在的问题，采取具体有效的措施，迅速解决。
    第二，地委要求各级党委要在保证质量的前提下，第一批开展农村整风和社会主义教育运动的社，于12月底前完成，第二批于春节前完成。在第一批结束前，各地即应作好第二批的安排和准备。同时，凡是仍在鸣放的社，要迅速转入整改，要狠狠地烧三个主义，在整改中继续发动群众大鸣大放，目前开展辩论的，好的要坚持下去，不好的也要转入整改，从整改中发动群众开展辩论。
    第三，为了按时按质按量完成农村整风和社会主义教育的任务，各级党委在指导思想上必须解决以下几个问题：首先是整风运动必须和生产运动紧密结合，同时作好。为此，所有农村干部，要一无例外的一身二任，既要领导好当前水利积肥等生产运动，又要领导好群众的大鸣大放大辩论。负责第一批整风的干部要固定下来，除搞好整风外，要将生产工作包起来，通过整党整社和全民整风，掀起生产高潮。其次，要认真克服右倾思想，大胆地改、坚决地改、彻底地改。第三，要克服目前一部分党委和党员干部中存在的松懈自满和半途而废的思想。
