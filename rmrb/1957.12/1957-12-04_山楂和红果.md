　　Hawthorn and Red Haw
　　Jiang Younong
    Hawthorn was originally a common wild fruit. Due to the long-term cultivation by the working people, a semi-cultivated variant has formed in North China, which is the red haw (also known as mountain red) that everyone is familiar with. The fruit of the red haw is two-thirds larger than the hawthorn, and the sour taste is also lower.
    Hawthorn and red haw have five major characteristics:
    First, they contain extremely rich vitamin C. According to the materials of the Nutrition Department of the Central Institute of Hygiene in 1955, every 100 grams (equivalent to 3.2 liang) of red haw contains 89 mg of vitamin C (ascorbic acid); this year, the results of experiments conducted by scientists such as Guo Chengcai using two different analytical methods showed that the vitamin C content of red haw is 83.4 and 53.3 mg. From the above materials, it can be seen that every 100 grams of red haw contains at least several tens of milligrams of vitamin C. Apples, pears, etc. only contain a few milligrams of vitamin C per 100 grams. Only fruits such as citrus can compare with hawthorn and red haw in terms of vitamin C content.
    The other nutrients in hawthorn and red haw are also very high. According to the same materials from the Nutrition Department of the Institute of Hygiene, compared with apples, red haw contains about seven times more calcium, six times more iron, about nine times more carotene (a substance that can be converted into vitamin A), and more than 50% more carbohydrates; compared with citrus fruits, the content of the above ingredients is also higher.
    Second, it can very effectively aid digestion. Fruits generally have the ability to aid digestion, but hawthorn and red haw have a greater effect on aiding digestion. This point was once recorded in the ancient Chinese medical book "Simple Prescriptions." The effective digestive drugs commonly used by traditional Chinese medicine, such as fried hawthorn and charred hawthorn, are made from hawthorn.
    Third, hawthorn and red haw both contain high levels of acid. Acidic substances can preserve vitamin C, making it less likely to be destroyed when heated. Therefore, eating them cooked will not destroy too much vitamin C, which is also incomparable to ordinary fruits.
    Fourth, hawthorn and red haw are inexpensive.
    In addition, they have another characteristic, that is, when stewing meat, especially stewing beef and old chicken, adding two or three hawthorns or red haws will not only make the meat easier to cook, but also make the meat more tender.
    Therefore, hawthorn and red haw are a particularly worthy of recommendation, inexpensive and good quality fruit.

### 山楂和红果

　　山楂和红果
　　江幼农
    山楂，原来是一种常见的野生水果。由于劳动人民的长期培育，又在华北，形成了一种半栽培性的变种，就是大家都熟悉的红果（又叫山里红）。红果的果实比山楂大三分之二，酸味也较低。
    山楂和红果具有五大特点：
    第一、含有极丰富的维生素丙。根据中央卫生研究院营养学系1955年的材料，红果每百克（合三点二市两）含维生素丙（抗坏血酸）89毫克；今年，郭成才等科学工作者用两种不同分析方法试验的结果，红果的维生素丙含量是83.4和53.3毫克。从上面的材料可以看出，每百克红果最少含维生素丙几十毫克。而苹果、梨等每百克仅仅含维生素丙几毫克。只有柑橘等类水果，维生素丙的含量才能和山楂、红果比美。
    山楂和红果的其他养分也很高。根据卫生研究院营养学系同上材料，红果和苹果相比，钙约高七倍、铁高六倍、胡萝卜素（可以变成维生素甲的物质）约高九倍、碳水化合物约高50％以上；红果和柑桔类比较，以上成分的含量也都是较高的。
    第二、它可以十分有效地帮助消化。水果一般都有帮助消化的能力，但山楂、红果助消化的作用更大。关于这一点，在我国的古医书“简便方”中就曾经有过记载。现在中医所常用的炒山楂、焦山楂等帮助消化的有效药物，都是用山楂做成的。
    第三、山楂和红果都含酸较高，酸性物质可以保持维生素丙，使它在加热时不易被破坏。所以把它们煮熟来吃，维生素丙也不致被破坏得太多，这也是一般水果所不能比的。
    第四、山楂和红果价格低廉。
    此外，它们还有一个特点，那就是在炖肉、特别是炖牛肉和老鸡时，如放山楂或红果二、三个，不但肉容易烧烂，而且可使肉变嫩。
    因此，山楂和红果是一种特别值得推荐的、价廉物美的水果。
