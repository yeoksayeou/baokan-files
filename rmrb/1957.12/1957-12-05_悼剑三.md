On the evening of the 30th of last month, a comrade from the People's Daily called me to say that Mr. Wang Tongzhao had passed away. I was exceedingly saddened to hear this. This year, when the People's Congress convened its fourth session, Jian San (the name we friends habitually used for Mr. Wang) had a relapse as soon as he arrived in Beijing and was hospitalized in the Beijing Hospital for treatment. He asked someone to send me an inscribed album, wanting some old friends to write something on it as a memento. I wrote an old poem of mine and passed the album on to Mr. Zhenduo. At the time, I kept thinking of visiting him, but never managed to make it, and now it's too late for regrets.

Our friendship spanned nearly forty years, and although we didn't meet often, we understood each other at heart. It didn't matter if we didn't see each other for years or exchange a single letter. We simply trusted that you would have things you would do and things you wouldn't, and I would have things I would do and things I wouldn't, and that was enough. When we did meet or correspond, talking for two or three hours or writing two or three pages, it reaffirmed our mutual trust, and we were extraordinarily happy, each feeling like we had tasted the best flavor of friendship. Such a friend has now departed, never to return, never to communicate with again. How could I not be exceedingly saddened?

In abstract terms, Jian San was simple, sincere, yearning for brightness, clear in his likes and dislikes. After liberation, he loved the new society and devoted himself to the work he was assigned. He was personally selfless, seeking only the welfare of the masses and the prosperity of society. I wouldn't say that his transformation was complete, that he had reached the stage of total rebirth, but I would say that he retained a considerable amount of the positive elements from his old upbringing, and that the habits of selfishness were very few. At the age of sixty, he wasn't too old, and if he had been physically stronger and able to live for another ten or eight years, then it wouldn't have been difficult for him to meet the standards that the new society required of intellectuals. In the autumn of 1954, I met him in Shanghai. He had come to Shanghai for the East China Drama Festival, almost forcing himself to go despite his illness. He was unwilling to miss seeing plays or participating in discussions. Seeing him panting for breath, finding it difficult to climb a dozen steps of the escalator, I advised him to rest more, but he said that the affairs of the festival were very important, and since he had come to Shanghai, he couldn't be careless. From this one example, one can infer the others. He held many positions in Shandong, and I don't know the details of his work, but I think the friends in Shandong must have a lot to say.

Before the War of Resistance, he came to Suzhou to see me, and we went together to visit the East Dongting Mountain and West Dongting Mountain in Taihu Lake. In the late autumn of 1955, I went to Taihu Lake again, and the two Dongting Mountains were completely changed. The vast majority of fruit farmers and fishermen had joined cooperatives. The fruit farmers not only happily talked about the various benefits of cooperation for the fruit tree industry, but also put forward requirements and methods for increasing production and improving varieties. The fishermen, who had always lived on boats and had no land to live on, now had plans to all move ashore within a few years. At that time, I thought, how meaningful it would be to come with Jian San, to discuss the differences between the past and the present together! This expectation can now never be realized, and I am exceedingly saddened!

Jian San wrote the full-length novel "Mountain Rain." I read his original manuscript and also took care of the publishing aspects for him. In recent years, he told me that he still wanted to engage in creative writing, wanting to draw on historical events of the past few decades for his subject matter. I of course encouraged him, saying that looking at the historical events of the past few decades today would always be different from looking at them a decade or two ago, that it would always be more correct than then, and that today's young people really need to know about the historical events of the past few decades. He said that he only hoped his health would improve so he could take the time to start writing. Now he will never write again, and I am exceedingly saddened!

This year he was unable to attend the People's Congress meeting, but he still勉力 (mianli,勉力 means to do with effort when it is difficult or impossible) wrote a written speech on his sickbed and distributed it to all the delegates. In the speech were the following words: "In the past eight years in Shandong, I can say that I have been in contact with Communist Party comrades almost every day, attending meetings, handling affairs, studying problems, exchanging opinions, and I am confident that there has been no separation between us, and I have also learned a lot. I am also not perfunctory or evasive with comrades, saying what should be said, doing what should be done, as long as it is for the benefit of the masses and the improvement of work, what need is there for politeness here, and what separation is there between inside and outside the Party." Although the words are brief, they are enough to show his simplicity and sincerity, his spirit of loving the Party and loving the people. We mourn the deceased, but also encourage the living. I have copied Jian San's words here simply to let everyone know that Jian San was such a person.

    悼剑三
    叶圣陶
    上月30日傍晚，人民日报社的同志打电话给我，说王统照先生病故了，我听了异常怅惘。今年人代大会开第四次会议，剑三（我们一班朋友习惯称王先生的字）一到北京就旧病复发，入北京医院治疗。他托人送来一本题字的册子，要好些老朋友在上面写些什么，留作纪念。我写了一首旧作的诗，就把那册子转给振铎先生。当时老想去探望他，始终没去成，现在是后悔也来不及了。
    将近四十年的交情，虽然叙首的时候不多，可是彼此相知以心。好几年不见一回面，不通一回信，都无所谓。只是相互相信，你也有所为，有所不为，我也有所为，有所不为，这就尽够了。待见面或者通信的时候，谈这么两三个钟头，写这么两三张信笺，又证实了彼此的相信，于是欢喜超乎寻常，各自以为尝到了友情的最好的味道。是这样的一位朋友，现在他去了，永远不回来了，再不能跟他通消息了，哪得不异常怅惘？
    用抽象的词语说，剑三朴实，诚挚，向往光明，严明爱憎，解放以后热爱新社会，尽力他所担任的工作，个己方面无所求，所求的只在群众的福利和社会的繁荣。我不说他改造已经到了家，达到了脱胎换骨的境界，只说他从旧教养中得来的积极因素保持得相当多，为己为私的习染非常少，六十岁的年纪也不算大，要是体质强健些，能够多活十年八年，那末他是不难达到新社会所要求于知识分子的标准的。1954年的秋季，我在上海遇见他，他到上海为的是华东戏剧会演，几乎是抱病而往。看戏，参加讨论，他都不肯放松。看他气嘘嘘的，走十几级扶梯也觉得吃力，劝他多多休息，他可说会演的事儿很重要，既然来上海，就不能随便。即此一端，可以推见其他。他在山东担任好些工作，工作情况我不详细，我想山东的朋友一定有好些可以说的。
    抗战以前，他到苏州看我，一块儿去游太湖里的洞庭东山洞庭西山。1955年深秋，我又到太湖，东西两山完全变了样。果农渔民绝大多数参加了合作社。果农不但高高兴兴称说合作对于果树业的种种好处，还提出提高产量改良品种的要求和办法。渔民向来是以舟为家，没有陆居的份儿的，现在可有了几年内全部登陆的打算。我当时想，要是跟剑三一块儿来，共同谈谈今昔的不同，那多有意思啊！这个期望，现在是永远不能实现了，我异常怅惘！
    剑三写成长篇小说“山雨”，我读他的原稿，又为他料理出版方面的工作。近年来他对我说，他还想从事创作，想就近几十年的历史事件取题材。我当然怂恿他，我说在今天看近几十年的历史事件，总会跟前一二十年那时候看有所不同，总会比那时候看得正确些，而今天的青少年也确实需要知道近几十年的历史事件。他说只望身体好些，就抽空动笔。现在他永远不会动笔了，我异常怅惘！
    今年他不能出席人代大会会议，还勉力在病床上写成书面发言稿，分发给全体代表。发言稿中有以下的话：“八年来我在山东可说几乎天天与党员同志们接触，开会，办事，研究问题，互提意见，自信这其间并无什么隔阂，而且我也学习了不少的东西。我对同志们亦不敷衍，对付，该说的说，该作的作，只要为了群众的利益，工作上的改进，这里何须客气，又何有党内外的分别”。话虽简略，已够见出他的朴实和诚挚，他的爱党爱人民的精神。我们悼念逝者，一方面也在激励生者，我把剑三的话抄在这里，无非要让大家知道剑三是这样的一个人。
