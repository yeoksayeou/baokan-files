    Bucharest Dispatch from Our Newspaper: The Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Romania, member of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, and engineer, Mr. 波·格拉西穆 (Bō Gélāsīmù), received our newspaper's reporter on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Romania. During the meeting, the reporter asked him to introduce the achievements made in various aspects since the founding of the People's Republic of Romania. Comrade Gherasim's statement is as follows:
    December 30, 1957, marks the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Romania. Ten years ago, after driving out the last group of bourgeois representatives from the government, the monarchy was abolished, and the entire political power was transferred to the working class and its allies. This victory achieved by the working class under the leadership of its party marked the entry of our country's revolution into the second stage—the socialist revolution stage. During this stage, the people's democratic state—the state of the working people in urban and rural areas—eliminated the bourgeoisie in the industrial and financial sectors as a class. Through the nationalization of the main means of production in industries, transportation, and other sectors, a strong socialist economy was created in the national economy, and a large-scale socialist construction undertaking was started.
    The Romanian Workers' Party has been and continues to be the initiator and organizer of these profound revolutions. The masses of people, realizing the party's policies, have renewed the mess left by the bourgeois landlord regime in a short period of time, ensured a huge surge in the country's productive forces, and achieved decisive victories in building the foundation of a socialist economy within ten years. During the era of the people's regime, tremendous material and financial efforts were made in developing industry. Between 1950 and 1956 alone, the total investment in industrial development exceeded 43.7 billion lei. As a result, our country's industrial production in 1956 increased by 2.3 times compared to 1938. This significant increase in industrial production has made industry the leading force in the national economy. If the share of industry in the national income was only 19.8% in 1938, then in 1956 it already accounted for about 52% of the national income.
    The Romanian Workers' Party, firmly implementing the Marxist-Leninist doctrine according to the specific conditions of our country, has ensured the priority development of heavy industry because heavy industry is the lasting foundation for technological progress and expanded socialist reproduction in the national economy. In 1956, the production of means of production increased by 3.1 times compared to 1938.
    An achievement of particular significance is the establishment and development of a strong machine-manufacturing industry. Currently, the output of the machine-manufacturing industry accounts for more than one-fifth of the total industrial output. It can now meet more than three-quarters of the equipment and machinery required by various sectors of the national economy and also has the capacity to export. If pre-war Romania could not export even a single piece of industrial equipment, then currently the machine exports of the People's Republic of Romania account for more than 10% of the total exports.
    It is worth emphasizing the brilliant achievements made by the people's regime in developing the oil industry. During the period from 1948 to 1956, the country's oil production has increased by more than 1.6 times. In 1957, our country produced 11 million tons of crude oil, which makes our country the second largest crude oil producer among the socialist countries. Our chemical industry and power industry have also been greatly developed.
    In order to continuously improve the living standards of the working people, the people's regime has also paid great attention to the development of the consumer goods industry. In 1956, the total output of consumer goods increased by one and a half times compared to 1938. Compared to 1938, food production increased by 95% in 1956, textile production increased by nearly two times, and clothing production increased by four times.
    The profound changes that have taken place in agriculture and rural life in the past ten years are of great significance. In 1949, under the call of the Party and with the help of the people's democratic state, the socialist transformation of agriculture began. The number of farmers voluntarily participating in collective farms, mutual-aid teams, and agricultural production cooperatives has increased year by year. Currently, the collectivized land accounts for 46% of the total agricultural area of the country. Many counties in Constanța Oblast and other oblasts have been completely collectivized.
    The victories achieved in developing the national economy in the socialist direction have had a profound impact on the material living conditions of the people. In the past ten years, the national income has continuously increased and is currently 1.5 times higher than in 1948. Three-quarters of the national income is used as the personal and social consumption fund for the working people. The increase in the living standards of the working people can be seen from other indicators, such as the increase in consumer goods production, the increase in commodity turnover, and the increase in real wages. For example, the commodity turnover in 1956 was more than 31 billion lei, while it was only 9.9 billion lei in 1948 (calculated at comparable prices).
    The state's measures regarding the development of education, culture and science, public health, and sports have also greatly contributed to improving living standards. In 1957, expenditures on social and cultural measures accounted for 25% of the total state budget. The people's regime has eliminated illiteracy—a shameful legacy left by the landlord bourgeoisie—and cultivated a new intelligentsia from the people. Unlike in the past, today millions of working people in urban and rural areas can enjoy the benefits of culture and science.
    Along with economic and cultural development, the People's Republic of Romania has also achieved great political development. Unlike in the past, today the working people can truly enjoy the rights and freedoms stipulated by the constitution, because these rights and freedoms are guaranteed by the material foundation of public ownership. With the development of the national economy, the employment of the working people is guaranteed. National minorities truly enjoy equal rights with the Romanian people. The profound democracy of our existing system is particularly powerfully manifested in the fact that the broad masses of working people participate in the leadership of national and public affairs through people's congresses, trade unions, and other mass organizations and institutions. The powers of the people's congresses have now been expanded.
    The reason why the Romanian people have been able to achieve great victories in the past ten years is precisely because the broad masses of people understand the Party's policies and are waging selfless struggles for their realization.
    The consolidation of the people's democratic system in our country and our country's unwavering policy of peaceful cooperation with all countries based on the principles of peaceful coexistence have enabled the People's Republic of Romania to enjoy a growing international prestige. In the past ten years, the friendly and fraternal cooperation between the People's Republic of Romania and other socialist countries, especially with the Soviet Union, has been developed and strengthened. The characteristic of the socialist construction process in the People's Republic of Romania is that this construction is not carried out in isolation, but under the conditions of comradely mutual assistance on the basis of the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and under the conditions of mutual coordination of the long-term plans for the development of the economies of the socialist countries, the implementation of socialist international division of labor, and the implementation of specialization and collaboration in production. It should be particularly pointed out the material and technical assistance given by the Soviet Union in the construction of heavy industrial projects in our country and in ensuring the raw materials needed by our industry. Thanks to this assistance, we have been able to build many major industrial enterprises.
    The achievements of the People's Republic of Romania since its founding ten years ago powerfully demonstrate that only the people's democratic state and only the socialist system can end the economic and technological backwardness of Romania, can ensure that the country's vast natural resources play a role, and can ensure the multifaceted prosperity of the national economy and culture.
    As it enters the eleventh year of the founding of the People's Republic of Romania, the working people of our country are looking to the future with full confidence. They know that under the wise leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, and in the close unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, they will achieve new successes in building socialist Romania, in continuously improving the people's living standards, and in strengthening the great forces of peace, democracy, and socialism.

    格拉西穆答本报记者问
    罗马尼亚建国十年来成就辉煌
    国民收入增加一点五倍　工业生产比战前增长两倍多
    本报布加勒斯特专电　罗马尼亚人民共和国部长会议副主席、罗马尼亚工人党中央委员、工程师波·格拉西穆，在罗马尼亚人民共和国成立十周年的前夕接见了本报记者。在接见时，记者请他介绍了罗马尼亚人民共和国成立十年来在各方面所获得的成就。格拉西穆同志的谈话如下：
    到1957年12月30日，罗马尼亚人民共和国成立十周年了。十年以前，在把最后一批资产阶级的代表由政府内赶走后，取消了君主政体，整个政权转入工人阶级和其同盟者手中。工人阶级在其政党领导下所取得的这个胜利，标志着我国革命进入了第二阶段——社会主义革命阶段。在这个阶段内，人民民主国家——城乡劳动人民的国家——把工业和金融部门的资产阶级作为阶级消灭了。通过把工业、运输等部门内的主要生产工具的国有化，在国民经济中创立了一个强大的社会主义经济，并开始了大规模的社会主义建设事业。
    罗马尼亚工人党过去和现在一直是这些深刻的革命的发动者和组织者。人民群众，实现着党的政策，在短短的时间内即更新了资产阶级地主政权的烂摊子，保证了国家生产力的巨大高涨，并在十年内在建设社会主义经济基础方面取得了决定性的胜利。在人民政权的年代里，在发展工业方面作了巨大的物资和财政的努力。仅在1950—1956年间，发展工业的投资总额为四百三十七亿列依以上。结果我国的工业生产1956年比1938年增长二点三倍，工业生产的这个重要增长使工业成为国民经济中的领导力量。如果在1938年国民收入中工业所占的份额只有19.8％，那么在1956年它在国民收入中已占52％左右。
    罗马尼亚工人党，根据我国具体条件坚定不移地贯彻着马克思列宁主义学说，保证了重工业的优先发展，因为重工业是技术进步和国民经济中扩大社会主义再生产的持久基础。1956年生产资料的生产比1938年增长了三点一倍。
    一个具有特别重要意义的成就是创立和发展了强大的机器制造工业。目前，机器制造业的产量占工业总产量的五分之一以上。它已能满足国民经济各部门所需的设备和机械的四分之三以上，而且还有能力输出。如果说战前罗马尼亚连一种工业设备也不能输出的话，那么目前罗马尼亚人民共和国的机器输出量已占总输出量的10％以上。
    值得着重提出的是人民政权在发展石油工业方面获得的辉煌成就。在1948—1956年期间，国家的石油产量已经增长了一点六倍多。1957年，我国出产了一千一百万吨原油，这使我国的原油产量在社会主义国家中占第二位。我国的化学工业和电力工业也得到了巨大发展。
    为了不断的提高劳动人民的生活水平，人民政权同时十分注意发展日用消费品工业。1956年消费品的总产量比1938年增长了一倍半，与1938年比较，1956年食品生产增长了95％，纺织品的产量增长了近二倍，服装的产量增长了四倍。
    近十年来在农业和农村生活中发生了的深刻变化是具有重大意义的。1949年在党的号召和人民民主国家的帮助下，开始了对农业所进行的社会主义改造。自愿参加集体农庄、共耕社、农业生产合作社的农民人数，逐年增加。现在，合作化了的土地已占有全国总农业面积的46％。康斯坦萨州和其他一些州内许多县已经完全合作化了。
    在按社会主义方向发展国民经济方面所取得的胜利，对人民的物质生活条件产生了深刻的影响。最近十年来，国民收入有了不断的增长，目前已比1948年增加一点五倍。国民收入的四分之三被用作劳动人民的个人和社会消费基金。劳动人民生活水平的增长可从其他一些指标数字上看出来，如消费品生产的增长、商品流转额的增长和实际工资的增长等。例如，1956年的商品流转额为三百一十多亿列依，而1948年时仅为九十九亿列依（以比较价格计算）。
    国家关于发展教育、文化和科学、公共保健和体育的措施也大大有助于生活水平的提高。1957年用于社会文化措施的费用占全部国家预算的25％。人民政权消灭了文盲——地主资产阶级所留下的可耻的遗产，并培养了来自人民的新的知识分子。与过去不同，今天成百万城乡劳动人民都能享受到文化和科学的好处。
    随着经济和文化的发展，罗马尼亚人民共和国在政治上也获得了巨大发展。与过去不同，今天劳动人民能够真正享受到宪法所规定的权利和自由，因为这些权利和自由有全民所有制的物质基础作保证。随着国民经济的发展，劳动人民的工作获得了保证。少数民族真正享受到与罗马尼亚人民完全平等的权利。我国现存制度的深刻民主性，特别有力的表现在广大劳动人民群众通过人民会议、工会和其他群众组织和机构以参加国家和公共事业的领导这件事实上面。今并扩大了人民会议的职权。
    罗马尼亚人之所以能在过去十年中取得巨大胜利正是由于广大人民群众了解了党的政策，并为它的实现而进行忘我的斗争。
    人民民主制度在我国内所获得的巩固以及我国根据和平共处原则与一切国家所实行的坚持不渝的和平合作政策，使罗马尼亚人民共和国在国际上享有日益增长的威信。过去十年中，罗马尼亚人民共和国与其他社会主义国家首先是与苏联的友好和兄弟合作关系获得了发展和加强。罗马尼亚人民共和国社会主义建设过程的特点，在于这一建设不是孤立的进行的，而是在平等互利原则基础上的同志互助的条件下进行的，是在各社会主义国家发展经济的远景计划相互配合、实行社会主义国际分工和在生产上实行专业化和协作化的条件下进行的。应当特别指出苏联在我国重工业项目建设和保证我国工业所需原料方面所给予我国的物质和技术援助。由于这一援助，我们才能建设起许多重大的工业企业。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国成立十年以来的成就，十分有力的表明：只有人民民主国家，只有社会主义的制度才能结束罗马尼亚经济、技术的落后状态，才能保证国家巨大的自然资源发挥作用，才能保证国民经济和文化多方面的繁荣。
    在进入罗马尼亚人民共和国成立第十一年的时候，我国的劳动人民满怀信心地注视着未来。他们知道在罗马尼亚工人党英明的领导下，在以苏联为首的社会主义国家的亲密的团结下他们将在建设社会主义的罗马尼亚，在不断提高人民生活水平，在加强和平、民主和社会主义的巨大力量方面获得新的成就。
