　　The Historical Origins of the Hanyu Pinyin Scheme
　　Luo Changpei
    The long-awaited draft of the Hanyu Pinyin Scheme has been published, to the great expectation of the people of all ethnic groups. This draft is the result of long-term research and discussion, bringing into play collective wisdom, and gradual revision. The right-wingers like Zhang Bojun fabricated rumors to confuse the public, saying that this draft was handled by a few people alone, which is completely contrary to the facts. The detailed process of the Hanyu Pinyin Scheme being discussed multiple times among people across the country has already been explained elsewhere, so it will not be repeated here. This article only intends to briefly explain the evolutionary history of the Hanyu Pinyin Scheme, to show the historical origins of the "Hanyu Pinyin Scheme Draft."
    (I)
    Since the late 19th century, many people with patriotic ideas believed that the country was weak due to the lack of widespread education; the lack of widespread education was due to the complexity of Chinese characters. Therefore, they advocated for Chinese character reform. Some advocated imitating the Latin phonetic alphabet created by Western missionaries to create letters to replace Chinese characters or assist in the pronunciation of Chinese characters. Some advocated imitating Japanese kana to create simplified phonetic characters to improve the fanqie and assist in pronunciation. Evolving from the latter idea, the Zhuyin alphabet, which had played a considerable role in assisting the pronunciation of Chinese characters in the past forty years, was successfully created. Evolving from the former idea, the Hanyu Pinyin Scheme Draft, which is now being published, was successfully created. If we trace the historical origins of this pinyin scheme, we can confidently say that it was conceived 352 years ago (1605), and only in the last sixty years has it gradually developed and grown, during which it has undergone countless setbacks and consumed the painstaking efforts of countless people, and only now can it be completed. This is entirely the result of historical deduction and can never be suddenly accomplished by a few people overnight.
    Using Latin letters to annotate Chinese was initially caused by foreign missionaries who came to China to learn Chinese language and literature. In the eleventh year of the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty (1583), Matteo Ricci and Ruggieri entered Zhaoqing. "At first, their language and writing were not understood, so they painstakingly studied, referring to pictures of people, asking people to point them out, gradually understanding the language and understanding the writing." He was able to learn Chinese language and literature quickly, mainly relying on Latin letter phonetic annotations to help him, in addition to learning characters through pictures. According to existing documents, "Chengshi Moyuan" contains four Chinese articles annotated with Latin letters by Matteo Ricci in the thirty-third year of the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty (1605): 1. "Believe and walk on the sea, doubt and sink," 2. "Two disciples heard the truth and abandoned emptiness," 3. "Lewd colors and foul odors hasten the fire of heaven," 4. "A prose given to young Bo Chengzi." These four articles are all rubbings of Huizhou ink, with Chinese and Latin texts in parallel. Mr. Chen Yuan once reprinted and published them based on the collection of Wang Shi Minghuilu in Tongxian, titled "Europeanization of Art and Romanization of Phonetics in the Late Ming Dynasty" (now reprinted by the Text Reform Publishing House, renamed "Romanization of Phonetic Articles in the Late Ming Dynasty"). These four phonetic documents have a total of 387 Chinese characters with different pronunciations. Summarizing the phonetic system, 26 "letter fathers" (i.e., initials), 44 "letters" (i.e., finals), and five tone symbols are analyzed. After him, there was also the "Zhaoxue Tang Ruowang Wenjian" published in Guangzhou in the tenth year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty (1671) by the Jesuit priest R. P. Antonius de Gouvea, with the Latin original name "Innocentia Victrix," with Chinese and Latin texts in parallel. The Chinese characters were accompanied by Latin phonetic transcriptions, and the fonts of each document were also copied according to the original style. The original is now in the British Museum in London. This document contains twelve types, with a total of 2,666 characters, plus another 26 characters sandwiched in the Latin text, for a total of 2,692 phonetic materials. If the repeated Chinese characters are not counted, there are still 666 phonetic transcriptions. Compared with the Latin phonetic transcriptions of Matteo Ricci collected in "Chengshi Moyuan," it is almost doubled. Although the two phonetic systems have a "roughly similar" scale, they do not restrict the differences between "minor similarities and major differences." This is also a phenomenon that should exist in the early Latin letter phonetic transcription.
    Twenty years after Matteo Ricci began to use Latin letters to annotate Chinese sounds (1605), and forty-six years before the publication of He Dahua's "Zhaoxue Tang Ruowang Wenjian," the Jesuit priest Nicolas Trigault applied the principle of using Latin letters to annotate Chinese sounds to create a book for foreigners to learn Chinese language and literature, called "Xiru Ermuzi" (1625). This book was carefully organized and unified by Chinese scholars according to the principles of Chinese phonology, which is naturally more systematic than the phonetic transcriptions casually written by Matteo Ricci and He Dahua. "Xiru Ermuzi" has a total of five "self-sounding letters" (i.e., vowels), twenty "co-sounding letter fathers" (i.e., consonants), four "non-sounding" sounds (i.e., consonants used in other countries but not in China), and five tone symbols: — "Clear (?), Turbid (?), Rising (?), Departing (?), Entering (?)". By applying this phonetic system, one can "rebel without intending to rebel, cut without intending to cut. Just list twenty-five letters, and once you ponder and polish them, the source of Chinese characters will be exhausted here." Compared with the "fanqie" made with Chinese characters and the convoluted and entangled "gate" method of rhyme tables, it is naturally much more progressive. The motives of foreign missionaries learning Chinese language and literature three hundred years ago were certainly ulterior, and we should discuss them separately, but their progress and achievements in using Latin letter phonetic transcription to learn Chinese language and literature are undeniable and significant facts. We are now using the Hanyu Pinyin Scheme to help learn Chinese characters, eliminate illiteracy, promote Mandarin Chinese, and facilitate international friends and fraternal ethnic groups to learn Chinese language and literature. Since the system of the scheme and the teaching methods are much better than before, will the learning results in the future not be better and faster than those of foreign missionaries three hundred years ago? Except for those who deliberately distort the facts, it is incomprehensible.
    (II)
    In the first year of the Yongzheng reign of the Qing Dynasty (1723), because of the Jesuit priest Tang Yunzheng, an order was issued: except for Westerners working in the Imperial Astronomical Observatory, all others were to be expelled to Macau and kept under surveillance, and were not allowed to enter the mainland. For more than a hundred years thereafter, the country closed itself off, and the need for Chinese transliteration was less than before. After the Opium War (1842), the maritime ban was lifted, and the vanguard of imperialism came to China to trade and preach more and more every day. All the personal names and place names used in customs, post offices, official documents, and newspapers had to be translated into Western languages. Foreigners who came to China to learn Chinese and spread religion also studied phonetic methods. As a result, Chinese phonetic dictionaries and vernacular Bibles written in foreign letters became very popular, but the spellings were different and the systems were inconsistent. Roughly, they can be classified into English, French, German, and Russian styles. Since the 19th century, many advanced people in our country have been inspired by patriotism and the Latin letter phonetic movement, and they have also risen up to create works. Based on existing materials, roughly analyzed, there can be the following types:
    1. Lu Ganczhang's "China's First Quick Phonetic New Characters" (1892)
    2. Zhu Wenxiong's "Jiangsu New Alphabet" (1906)
    3. Liu Mengyang's "Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Book" (1908)
    4. Huang Xubai's "Latin Text Conjecture" (1909)
    5. Xing Dao's "Phonetic Alphabet" (1913)
    6. Liu Jishan's "New China Characters" (1914)
    7. Zhong Xiong's "New Alphabet Invention Book" (1918) Among them, some used only 26 letters, such as Liu Mengyang's "Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Book"; some inverted or horizontally used Latin letters, such as Zhu Wenxiong's "Jiangsu New Alphabet"; some created a large number of variant Latin letters, such as Lu Ganczhang's "Phonetic New Characters"; some mainly used pinyin to cut Beijing sounds, such as Liu Mengyang's "Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Book"; some mainly used pinyin to cut regional sounds, such as Lu Ganczhang's "Phonetic New Characters" (pinyin cutting Xiamen sounds), Zhu Wenxiong's "Jiangsu New Alphabet" (pinyin cutting Wu sounds, later also wanted to add ㄓㄔㄕㄖ four sounds, ㄩㄣ又ㄞ four rhymes to replace the Zhuyin alphabet), Zhong Xiong's "New Alphabet" (pinyin cutting Cantonese sounds); some used letters to mark tones, such as Zhu Wenxiong's "Jiangsu New Alphabet", Huang Xubai's "Latin Text Conjecture", Liu Jishan's "New China Characters"; some added semantic symbols, such as Liu Jishan's "New China Characters". Although the number of letters set by each person and the expected functions were inconsistent, the common direction of effort was to use Latin letters to help Chinese character pronunciation or as popular writing. Although their phonetic methods and fantasies of adding semantic symbols still have many points that can be criticized, in the enlightenment period of the phonetic alphabet, we cannot bury their "pioneering" contributions now.
    During the enlightenment period of the phonetic alphabet, some people had already proposed the two ideas of "joining words into phrases" and using letters to mark tones. After the publication of the "Guoyu Yuekan Chinese Character Reform Issue" in August 1922, the trend of creating Latin letter phonetic schemes reached a climax, and the two ideas of "joining words into phrases" and using letters to mark tones became clearer than before. According to the literature, there are: two types of Qian Xuantong's style, one type of Zhao Yuanren's style (1922), and one type of Zhou Bianming's "Chinese National Language Sound and Letter System" (1923). Although there were differences in the methods of selecting letters, examining sounds, and marking tones, the consensus was that "word-by-word writing" must be used when spelling words. Zhao Yuanren's style, after Qian Xuantong, Liu Fu, Li Jinxi and others organized the "Few People's Association" to participate in opinions and personal modifications, took one year from September 26, 1925 to September 6, 1926, and held twenty-two meetings to draft a kind of National Language Romanization Scheme. The main features of this scheme are the pure use of Latin letters, the avoidance of additional symbols, word-by-word writing, and "each character has a tone, annotated with letters." At that time, because the Kuomintang reactionaries were unwilling to promote the cause of raising mass culture, they repeatedly delayed it until September 26, 1928, when it was announced by the then "University Council."
    On the other hand, Comrade Qu Qiubai also actively worked to create a Chinese Latinized New Writing Scheme in the Soviet Union. His scheme was discussed more than once among Chinese revolutionary comrades and Soviet sinologists in Moscow and Leningrad. Comrades Wu Yuzhang, Xiao San, and Soviet scientists such as Long Guofu and Guo Lute helped finalize this scheme. The alphabet of this Latinized New Writing Scheme has only twenty-eight symbols and does not use special symbols to mark tones. It was discussed at a sinology conference held in Boli in 1931, and it was effectively used for several years in schools and publications of overseas Chinese in the Soviet Union. Domestically, it was also warmly welcomed by many progressive intellectuals (including Lu Xun, Tao Xingzhi, Zhang Yilin, Xu Dishan, etc.), and was tirelessly and enthusiastically promoted by many language workers under the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries, laying a foundation among the masses.
    Summarizing the above description of the history of using Latin letters to spell Chinese, we can say that from 1605 to the present, although there has been a period of low tide (1723-1892) in the 352 years, the rest of the time has been gradually evolving. Although the promoters have been different, including foreign missionaries, patriotic people, linguists, and revolutionary pioneers, and their goals have been very different, they all wanted to create a Latin letter phonetic scheme to help learn Chinese characters or reform Chinese characters, which is a common point. The "Hanyu Pinyin Scheme Draft" now published is the crystallization of the Latin letter phonetic movement in the past three hundred years.
    (III)
    The basic forms of this draft and the National Language Romanization and the Latinized New Writing are largely the same. Among them, the use of bdg to represent ㄅㄉㄍ, and the use of ptk to represent 攵ㄊㄎ is a common feature of these three schemes. In the past, the phonetic scheme made by the German F. Lessing had already adopted this form, because the pronunciation of bdg in the South German dialect was originally a semi-voiced sound (bdg) between clear and voiced, which is close to the pronunciation of ㄅㄉㄍ in Northern Mandarin. Now, using bdg to represent ㄅㄉㄍ and ptk to represent 攵ㄊㄎ is a new usage of our original Latin letters, and has nothing to do with the distinction between clear and voiced sounds. The biggest differences between the draft and the other two schemes are that the National Language Romanization uses letters to mark tones, the Latinized New Writing basically does not mark tones, while the current draft adds ɑń???? four tone marks. In addition, the National Language Romanization uses the variant reading of jchsh as ㄐㄑㄒ, and the Latinized New Writing uses the variant reading of gkx as ㄐㄑㄒ; now the method of variant reading has been completely cancelled, and jqx is used to represent ㄐㄑㄒ. This is also an example of borrowing the Latin letter form to change the pronunciation. The final uses ü to represent ㄩ, which is different from the National Language Romanization's īū and the Latinized New Writing's y. However, because ㄐㄑㄒ does not combine with ㄨ, ㄐㄩ, ㄑㄩ, and ㄒㄩ can be written as ju, qu, and xu. Only lü and nü still need to be written with two dots, and these syllables are rarely used. Using ü to represent ㄩ has sufficient basis in international conventions and the history of the Hanyu Pinyin Scheme. In the past, Westerners J. Edkins, T.F. Wade, C.W. Mateer, C. Arendt, F. Lessing, and Chinese people Liu Mengyang and others have all used ü to represent ㄩ in Chinese. From this, it can be seen that the scheme now published is refined and processed through the collective wisdom of many people, rather than forcibly copied from any scheme.

　　汉语拼音方案的历史渊源
　　罗常培
    各族人民期待已久的汉语拼音方案草案公布了。这个草案是经过长期的研究讨论，发挥了集体的智慧，逐渐修改而成的。右派分子章伯钧之流造谣惑众，说这个草案是少数人包办的，这完全与事实违反。关于汉语拼音方案在全国人士中多次讨论的详细经过，因为已经另有说明，这里不再赘述。本文只想简单说明汉语拼音方案演进的略史，以见“汉语拼音方案草案”的历史渊源。
    （一）
    从十九世纪末叶以来，许多抱有爱国思想的人士认为国势孱弱，由于教育不普及；教育不普及，由于汉字繁难。于是群起提倡汉字改革。有的主张仿照西洋传教士所创的拉丁拼音字制造字母，来代替汉字，或辅助汉字读音。有的主张仿照日本假名制造拼音简字，以改良反切，辅助读音。由后一种主张演进，成功了过去四十年曾经对于辅助汉字读音起过相当作用的注音字母。由前一种主张演进，就成功了现在公布的汉语拼音方案草案。如果推溯这个拼音方案的历史渊源，我们可以肯定的说，它胚胎于三百五十二年以前（1605），到近六十年以来才逐渐发育滋长，其间不知经过多少次挫折，耗费了多少人的心血，一直到现在才能完成。这完全是历史推演的结果，绝不是少数人一朝一夕所能突然促成的。
    用拉丁字母标注汉文，最初还是由到中国来的外国传教士为学习汉语汉文而引起的。明万历十一年（1583）利玛窦（Matteo Ricci）偕罗明坚入端州。“初时言语文字未达，苦心学习，按图画人物，倩人指点，渐晓语言，旁通文字。”他对于汉语汉文所以能学习得很快，除了看图识字以外，主要是靠拉丁字母注音来帮助。根据现存的文献，“程氏墨苑”收有明万历三十三年（1605）利玛窦用拉丁字母标注的汉文四篇：1．“信而步海疑而即沈”，2．“二徒闻实即舍空虚”，3．“媱色秽气自速天火”，4．“述文赠幼博程子”。这四篇都是徽墨的拓本，汉文和拉丁文对照，陈垣先生曾据通县王氏鸣晦庐藏本影印行世，题名“明季之欧化美术与罗马字注音”（现有文字改革出版社重印本，改名“明末罗马字注音文章”）。这四篇注音文件一共有三百八十七个不同音的汉字。归纳它们拼音的系统，分析出二十六个“字父”（即声母），四十四个“字母”（即韵母），五个声调符号。在他以后还有清朝康熙十年（1671）耶稣会教士何大化（R．P．AntoniusdeGouvea）用汉文和拉丁文对照在广州刊布的“昭雪汤若望文件”，拉丁原名叫做“Innocentia 　Victrix”。汉字旁边都附着拉丁字对音，各文件的字体也都照原来的式样摹印。原件现藏伦敦不列颠博物馆。这份文件计有十二种，共存二千六百六十六字，另外还有夹在拉丁文里的二十六字；两项共计有二千六百九十二个对音材料。若除去重复的汉字不算，还有六百六十六个对音。比起“程氏墨苑”里所收利玛窦的拉丁字对音几乎多了一倍。两种拼音系统虽然有个“大致不离”的规模，却不限制“大同小异”的出入。这也是初期拉丁字拼音应有的现象。
    在利玛窦开始用拉丁字标注汉音（1605）后二十年，在何大化“昭雪汤若望文件”刊布前四十六年，耶稣会教士金尼阁（Nicolas　Trigault）又应用拉丁字标注汉音的原理作了一部为外国人学习汉语汉文的书，叫做“西儒耳目资”（1625）。这部书是经过中国学者的指示，根据中国音韵的原理，加过一番整齐划一的功夫的，自然比利玛窦和何大化顺手拼写的注音更为系统化了。“西儒耳目资”里共有五个“自鸣字母”（即元音），二十个“同鸣字父”（即辅音），四个“不鸣”的音（即他国用中国不用的辅音），五个声调符号：——“清（?）、浊（?）、上（?）、去（?）、入（?）”。应用这个拼音系统的方法，就可以“不期反而反，不期切而切。第举二十五字，才一因重摩荡，而中国文字之源，毕尽于此。”比起中国用汉字所作的“反切”和缴绕纠缠的等韵“门”法自然进步得多了。三百年以前的外国传教士学习汉语汉文的动机固然别有用心，我们应该另作别论，但是他们应用拉丁字拼音学习汉语汉文的进度和成就是不可磨灭的显著事实。我们现在用汉语拼音方案帮助学习汉字，扫除文盲，推广普通话，并且便利国际友人和兄弟民族学习汉语汉文，方案的系统和教学的方法既然都比从前好多了，难道将来学习的成绩还会不比三百年前的外国教士更好更快么？除了存心歪曲，是不可理解的。
    （二）
    清朝自雍正元年（1723）因为耶稣会教士党允礽，于是下令：除去在钦天监供职的西洋人外，其余都驱逐到澳门看管，不许阑入内地。此后百余年间，闭关自守，汉语译音的需要反不及从前。到了鸦片战争（1842）以后，海禁大开，帝国主义的先遣部队到中国来通商传教的一天比一天多，凡是税关、邮局、公文、报纸上所用的人名、地名必须经过西译。到中国来的外国人为学习汉语，传播宗教，也都研究拼音方式。于是用外国字母拼写的汉音字典、土白圣经盛极一时，而拼法互异，系统不一。大致可以归纳成英、法、德、俄各式。十九世纪以来，我国许多先进人士受了爱国主义的激发和拉丁字拼音运动的启示，也都闻风而起，有所著作，就现有资料约略分析，可以有以下各种：
    1、卢戆章“中国第一快切音新字”（1892）
    2、朱文熊“江苏新字母”（1906）
    3、刘孟扬“中国音标字书”（1908）
    4、黄虚白“拉丁文臆解”（1909）
    5、邢岛“拼音字母”（1913）
    6、刘继善“新华字”（1914）
    7、钟雄“新字母发明书”（1918）其中有纯用二十六字母的，如：刘孟扬的“中国音标字书”；有把拉丁字母倒用或横用的，如：朱文熊的“江苏新字母”；也有创造大批拉丁字母的变体的，如：卢戆章的“切音新字”；有以拼切北京音为主的，如：刘孟扬的“中国音标字书”；有以拼切方音为主的，如：“卢戆章的“切音新字”（拼切厦门音），朱文熊的“江苏新字母”（拼切吴音，后来也想增加ㄓㄔㄕㄖ四音、ㄩㄣ又ㄞ四韵代替注音字母），钟雄的“新字母”（拼切广东音）；有用字母标写声调的，如：朱文熊的“江苏新字母”，黄虚白的“拉丁文臆解”，刘继善的“新华字”；有另加义符的，如刘继善的“新华字”。他们各人所订的字母数目和预期的功用虽然不一致，但是想用拉丁字母帮助汉字读音或作为通俗文字，则是共同的努力方向。他们的拼音方法和另加义符的幻想虽然还有很多可以批评的地方，但是在拼音字母的启蒙运动时期，我们现在对于他们“笔路蓝缕”的功劳还是不可埋没的。
    在拼音字母启蒙运动时期，已经有人提出“联字成辞”和用字母标调两种意见。到了1922年8月“国语月刊汉字改革号”出版以后，创制拉丁字拼音方案的风气更达到高潮，对于“联字成辞”和用字母标调两种意见也比以前更加明确。就文献所载，有：钱玄同式两种，赵元任式一种（1922），周辨明“中华国语音声字制”一种（1923）。虽然对于选母、审音、标调各法互有不同，而拼字时必用“语词联写”则已趋于一致。赵元任式经过钱玄同、刘复、黎锦熙等人组织“数人会”参加意见和本人修改，计从1925年9月26日到1926年9月6日，历时一年，开会二十二次，才拟定了国语罗马字拼音方案一种。这种方案的特点主要在于纯用拉丁字母，避免附加符号，语词联写和“字各有调，以字母注”各点。当时因为国民党反动派对于提高大众文化的事业不愿推行，一再迁延，直到1928年9月26日才由当时的“大学院”公布。
    另外一方面，瞿秋白同志在苏联时也曾积极地为创立汉语拉丁化新文字方案而工作。他的方案当时在莫斯科和列宁格勒的中国革命同志和苏联汉学家中不止一次地讨论过。帮助这一方案最后定型的有吴玉章、萧三等同志和龙果夫、郭路特等苏联科学家。这个拉丁化新文字方案的字母表只有二十八个符号，并且没有采用专门标记声调的符号。1931年在伯力召开的一次汉学专门会议上进行过讨论，后来在旅苏华侨的学校里和出版物上也曾经有效地使用了若干年。在国内它也受到很多进步的知识分子（包括鲁迅、陶行知、张一麟、许地山等人）的热烈欢迎，并经许多语文工作者在国民党反动派的压迫下孜孜不倦地热心推行，在群众中打下了基础。
    总括上文所叙述关于用拉丁字母拼写汉语的历史，我们可以说，从1605年到现在，三百五十二年间虽然经过一段低潮（1723—1892），其余的时间都在逐步演进着的。其间的推动者虽有外国教士、爱国人士、语文学者、革命先进的不同，他们所抱的目的也很分歧，但是都想创造一种拉丁字母的拼音方案，来帮助学习汉字或改革汉字，这却是一个共同点。现在公布的“汉语拼音方案草案”正是近三百多年来拉丁字母拼音运动的结晶。
    （三）
    这个草案同国语罗马字和拉丁化新文字的基本形式都是大同小异的。其中如用bdg代表ㄅㄉㄍ，用ptk代表攵ㄊㄎ一点是这三个方案的共同特色。从前德国人雷兴（F．Lessing）所作的拼音方案已经采取了这种形式，因为南德方言对于bdg的读音本来是介乎清浊之间的半浊音（bdg），是和北方话ㄅㄉㄍ的发音相近的。现在用bdg代表ㄅㄉㄍ，用ptk代表攵ㄊㄎ，是我们对于原有拉丁字母的一种新用法，和清浊音的分别并没有关系。草案和其他两种方案出入较大的地方首先是国语罗马字用字母标调，拉丁化新文字基本上不标调，而现在的草案增加了ɑń????四个调号。此外还有国语罗马字用jchsh的变读作ㄐㄑㄒ，拉丁化新文字用gkx的变读作ㄐㄑㄒ；现在完全取消了变读的方法，另用jqx代表ㄐㄑㄒ。这也是一种借用拉丁字母形式改变读音的例子。韵母中用ü代表ㄩ，和国语罗马字的īū、拉丁化新文字的y都不同。但是因为ㄐㄑㄒ不跟ㄨ相并，所以ㄐㄩ、ㄑㄩ、ㄒㄩ可以写作ju、qu、xu。只有lü，nü仍旧要写两点，而这些音节是极少用的。用ü表ㄩ，在国际习惯上和汉语拼音方案的历史上都有充分的根据。过去西洋人艾约瑟（J．Edkins）、威妥玛（T．F．Wade）、马提尔（C．W．Mateer）、阿伦德（C．Arendt）、雷兴（F．Lessing）和中国人刘孟扬等的方案都曾经用ü代表过汉语中的ㄩ。于此可见，现在公布的方案是经过许多人的集体智慧提炼加工，而不是从任何方案硬搬过来的。
