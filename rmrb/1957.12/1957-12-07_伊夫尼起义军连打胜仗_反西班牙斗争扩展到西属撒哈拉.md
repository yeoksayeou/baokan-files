    Ifni Insurgents Win Successive Victories
    Anti-Spanish Struggle Expands to Spanish Sahara
    Xinhua News Agency, December 6th -- Rabat Dispatch: The people of Ifni continue to achieve victories in their struggle against the Spanish colonial army. Under the powerful blows of the insurgents, the Spanish troops guarding Tiliouine, in the southeastern tip of Ifni, were forced to abandon their stronghold on the 4th and flee. Currently, only the capital, Sidi Ifni, and three scattered small strongholds in the south remain under the control of the Spanish colonial army. The insurgents issued a communiqué on the 5th, expressing their confidence in the approaching final victory.
    According to a report on the 5th by "Al-Alam," the organ of the Moroccan Istiqlal Party, the struggle against Spanish colonialism has expanded to parts of Spanish Sahara. The people who launched an uprising in the area of El Aaiún have achieved their first victory, killing dozens of Spanish colonial soldiers.
    The Moroccan Communist Party issued a statement on the 4th, condemning the collusion between French and Spanish imperialists. The statement pointed out that French aircraft often participated when the Spanish Air Force violated Moroccan airspace.

    反西班牙斗争扩展到西属撒哈拉
    新华社6日讯　拉巴特消息：伊夫尼起义人民在反抗西班牙殖民军的战斗中继续取得胜利。在起义军的强大打击下，据守伊夫尼东南端提利奎因的西班牙军被迫在4日撤出据点，夺路而逃。目前只有首府西迪·伊夫尼和南部的三个零星小据点还在西班牙殖民军控制下。起义军在5日发表公报，表示对最后胜利的临近充满信心。
    据摩洛哥独立党机关报“旗帜报”5日报道，反西班牙殖民主义的斗争已经扩展到西属撒哈拉部分。在埃翁一带举行起义的人民已经取得了第一次胜利，打死了好几十名西班牙殖民军。
    摩洛哥共产党4日发表声明，谴责法国和西班牙帝国主义者狼狈为奸。声明指出，在西班牙空军侵犯摩洛哥领空时，往往有法国飞机参加。
