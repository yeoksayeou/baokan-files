　　Preventing Coal Gas Poisoning
　　Wu Jiwen
    The coal gas that is commonly said to cause poisoning refers to carbon monoxide, which is produced when coal burns with insufficient oxygen. Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that is slightly lighter than air. Therefore, when there is coal gas (carbon monoxide) in a room, it will quickly spread throughout the entire room, and people will not be aware of it.
    When air enters the lungs through the trachea, the oxygen in it is absorbed by the blood. The billions of red blood cells in the blood are oxygen transport trains. Through blood circulation, they transport the fully loaded oxygen to all parts of the body, supplying the cells' needs to sustain life. If coal gas is inhaled into the lungs, it will seize the oxygen's seat in the red blood cell transport train. Coal gas has 300 times greater ability to seize seats than oxygen. As a result, red blood cells almost completely carry coal gas and cannot transport oxygen. The human brain nerves, heart, and respiratory organs—important organs that maintain life—become paralyzed due to lack of oxygen, resulting in symptoms such as headache, palpitations, chest tightness, tinnitus, blurred vision, vomiting, chills, and weakness in the limbs, and even coma and death.
    Since the binding force of coal gas to red blood cells is very strong, even a small amount of coal gas can easily cause poisoning. When the air contains 0.4% coal gas, it will cause poisoning and death in just one hour. If this concentration is exceeded, death may occur immediately.
    Many families, eager for temporary warmth, often place stoves in rooms with tightly closed doors and windows. The coal gas produced by the stove during ignition, coal addition, extinguishing, or other incomplete combustion often remains in the room due to poor ventilation. Therefore, to prevent coal gas poisoning, the following points must be noted:
    First, coal ball stoves must be ignited and have coal added outdoors. Only when the flames are blazing and there are no blue flames (carbon monoxide burns with a pale blue flame) can they be moved indoors. Before going to bed, the coal ball stove must be moved outdoors to prevent the generation of large amounts of coal gas when the fire goes out, which can lead to poisoning.
    Second, those using foreign stoves should always check for leaks in the chimney; regularly remove accumulated soot from the chimney to prevent blockage that prevents coal gas from being released. The part of the chimney extending outside the house should be fitted with a bend to prevent coal gas from flowing back into the house. The fire door where the stove connects to the chimney should be opened, the stove lid should be closed, the ash accumulated at the bottom of the stove should be cleaned, and the stove should not be filled too full when adding coal. This ensures that the coal receives enough oxygen during combustion and that the generated coal gas is discharged outdoors in a timely manner.
    Third, windows must be left with cracks, or air holes or wind deflectors should be installed on the windows to allow fresh air from outside to flow in. In this way, even if there is a small amount of coal gas in the room, it can be washed away by the fresh air flowing in from outside.
    Besides taking the above measures, there are no methods or drugs that can eliminate coal gas and prevent poisoning. Some people think that putting orange peels, pine branches, persimmon peels, or a basin of water on the stove can remove coal gas. Some people think that if they do not smell coal gas, there is no coal gas. Some say that honeycomb coal (coal briquettes) and burnt coal cores will not produce coal gas. These ideas are wrong. Since coal gas is a colorless and odorless gas, people naturally cannot see or smell it. Sometimes we smell a smell emitted from the stove, which is other gases produced during coal combustion—hydrogen sulfide, etc.—and not the smell of carbon monoxide. Honeycomb coal and coal cores also contain carbon, and they will also produce carbon monoxide (coal gas) when they burn. Carbon monoxide is insoluble in water, and putting a basin of water on the stove can only prevent the indoor air from being too dry and cannot remove coal gas. As for the claim that orange peels, pine branches, and persimmon peels can remove coal gas, it is even more groundless.
    The disaster of coal gas can be avoided. The question is whether we have raised our vigilance.

　　防止煤气中毒
　　吴继文
    通常所说的使人中毒的煤气，是指煤燃烧时由于氧气不足所产生的一氧化碳。一氧化碳是一种没有颜色、没有气味、比空气稍轻的气体。所以屋里有了煤气（一氧化碳），很快就会弥漫到全屋，并且人们也觉不出来。
    空气经由人的气管进入肺脏后，其中的氧气就被血液吸收。血液内的几千亿红血球都是氧气的运输列车。它借着血液循环，把满载的氧气运送到身体各部，供给细胞的需要以支持生命。如果煤气被人们吸到肺里，它就要抢夺氧气在红血球运输列车内的座位。煤气比氧气抢夺座位的能力大三百倍。因此红血球几乎完全装运煤气，而不能运送氧气。人的大脑神经、心脏、呼吸器——这些维持生命的重要器官，因为得不到氧气而麻痹，以致发生头痛、心跳、胸闷、耳鸣、眼花、呕吐、恶寒、四肢无力等症状，甚至昏迷而死。
    煤气同红血球的结合力既然很强，所以只要有少量的煤气就容易使人中毒。当空气中含有的煤气达到千分之四时，不过一小时就会使人中毒而死。如果超过这个浓度，可能立刻死亡。
    很多家庭因为贪图一时温暖，常常把炉子放在门窗紧闭的屋子里。炉子在升火、添煤、熄火或其他燃烧不完全时所产生的煤气，常常因通风不良而留在屋内。因此，要防止煤气中毒，必须注意以下几点：
    第一，煤球炉必须在室外升火、添煤，等到火焰熊熊，没有蓝色火苗时（一氧化碳燃烧时呈淡蓝色），才能搬进室内。临睡前，必须把煤球炉搬到室外，以免火熄灭时产生大量煤气，发生中毒现象。
    第二，用洋炉子的，应该随时检查烟筒有没有漏气的地方；经常清除烟筒内积存的煤烟，以免因堵塞而使煤气放不出去。烟筒露出屋外的一部分要安上拐脖，使煤气不致倒灌到屋里来。炉子连接烟筒处的火门要打开，炉盖要盖上，炉底积灰要打扫，添煤时不要把炉子填得太满。这才能使煤燃烧时得到足够的氧气，使已产生的煤气及时排出室外。
    第三，窗户必须留缝，或在窗子上开气孔、装风斗，以便让室外的新鲜空气流进来。这样，室内即使有少量煤气，也可被室外流进的新鲜空气冲洗出去。
    除了采取以上措施外，没有任何方法或药物可以消灭煤气和防止中毒。有些人认为在炉子上放些橘皮、松枝、柿子皮或一盆水就可以去煤气，有的人以为没有闻到煤气味就没有煤气，有的说蜂窝煤（煤砖）和烧过剩下的煤核不会产生煤气，这些想法都是错误的。煤气既是无色无味的气体，人们当然看不见也闻不到。有时我们闻到一种炉子里散发出来的气味，那是煤燃烧时产生的其他气体——硫化氢等，并不是一氧化碳的气味。蜂窝煤和煤核同样含有炭，它们燃烧时也会产生一氧化碳（煤气）。一氧化碳是不溶解于水的，在炉子上放一盆水，只能使屋内空气不致太干燥，并不能去除煤气。至于橘皮、松枝、柿子皮可以去煤气的说法，更是毫无根据。
    煤气的灾害是可以避免的，问题在于我们是否提高了警惕。
