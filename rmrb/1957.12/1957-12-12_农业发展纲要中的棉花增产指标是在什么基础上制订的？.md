　　Answer to Reader's Question

　　On what basis were the cotton yield increase targets in the National Agricultural Development Program formulated?
    The National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) proposes the following cotton yield increase targets: "Starting from 1956, within twelve years, the average annual yield of cotton per mu (lint cotton) should be increased from 35 jin in 1955 (national average) to 40 jin, 60 jin, 80 jin, and 100 jin, respectively, depending on local conditions."
    China is one of the world's major cotton-producing countries. Based on 1955, the country's cotton field area was 86.59 million mu, with a total output of 30.36 million dan of lint cotton. In 1955, the national average yield of lint cotton per mu was 35 jin, an increase of more than 60% compared to the average yield of 21.6 jin in 1949, just after liberation. However, this yield level was still relatively low. In that year, the large-scale high-yield achievements in the Manas River cotton area of Xinjiang showed an average yield of 140 jin of lint cotton per mu across more than 80,000 mu of cotton fields. In Dunhuang County, the average yield of lint cotton per mu was 100.3 jin across more than 53,600 mu of cotton fields. In Cixi County, the average yield of lint cotton per mu was 85 jin across 520,000 mu of double-cropping cotton fields. In the Soviet Union's advanced cotton production, the average yield of cotton fields across the entire Soviet Union in that year was approximately 83 jin of lint cotton per mu. This indicates that China has great potential to increase the unit yield of cotton.
    China's cotton-growing areas are widely distributed, with a total of 1,338 cotton-producing counties nationwide (based on counties with more than 100 mu of cotton fields as the calculation standard). Analyzing the basis of cotton production in 1955 by county, there were 1,169 cotton-producing counties with a total of more than 54 million mu of cotton fields, where the average yield of lint cotton per mu was below 40 jin, including more than 11.63 million mu of cotton fields where the average yield of lint cotton per mu was below 20 jin. There were 169 cotton-producing counties with a total of more than 31.97 million mu of cotton fields, where the average yield of lint cotton per mu was above 40 jin, including 22 counties with 3.2 million mu of cotton fields where the average yield of lint cotton per mu was above 60 jin, with the highest county, Dunhuang, reaching an average yield of over 100 jin. According to this situation, in 1955, 63.1% of cotton fields had an average yield below 40 jin, of which 13.4% of cotton fields had an average yield below 20 jin. In addition, 33.2% of cotton fields had an average yield of lint cotton per mu between 40 jin and 60 jin, and 3.7% of cotton fields had an average yield above 60 jin, including one county with an average yield above 100 jin, accounting for 0.06%.
    The cotton yield increase targets in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) were formulated on this basis. A large-area average yield of 100 jin of lint cotton per mu had never existed in old China, but it began to appear in 1955, which is the goal to strive for in future cotton yield increases. Average yields of 80 jin and 60 jin of lint cotton per mu have also appeared, but they are not numerous. In 1955, the average yield in most cotton-growing areas was between 20 jin and 50 jin of lint cotton per mu. Therefore, 60 jin, 80 jin, and 100 jin can be used as yield increase targets to be achieved separately by most regions within twelve years. In addition, some regions have poorer conditions and very low yields, with average yields below 20 jin of lint cotton per mu, or even below 10 jin of lint cotton per mu. For these regions, achieving an average of 40 jin of lint cotton per mu within twelve years is also a goal to strive for. Of course, an average yield of 100 jin of lint cotton per mu is not the highest limit.
    This year, five counties and cities nationwide have already achieved an average cotton field yield of 100 jin of lint cotton, six counties and cities have achieved an average cotton field yield of 80 jin of lint cotton, and forty-one counties and cities have achieved 60 jin of lint cotton. This year, eight provinces and cities have exceeded an average cotton field yield of 40 jin. The large number of high-yield models appearing everywhere this year fully demonstrates that the twelve-year cotton yield increase targets of the National Agricultural Development Program are entirely possible to achieve.

### 农业发展纲要中的棉花增产指标是在什么基础上制订的？

　　农业发展纲要中的棉花增产指标是在什么基础上制订的？
    全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）对棉花增产指标提出：“从1956年开始，在十二年内，棉花每亩平均年产量（皮棉），由1955年的三十五斤（全国平均数），按照各地情况，分别增加到四十斤、六十斤、八十斤和一百斤”。
    我国是世界上主要产棉国家之一。以1955年为基础来讲，这一年全国棉田面积八千六百五十九万亩，总产皮棉三千零三十六万担。1955年全国平均亩产皮棉三十五斤，比刚解放时1949年的棉花平均产量二十一点六斤，已提高了60％以上。但这一单产水平还是比较低的。这一年新疆玛纳斯河流域棉区大面积丰产成绩，八万多亩棉花平均亩产皮棉达一百四十斤；敦煌县全县五万三千六百多亩棉田，平均亩产皮棉一百点三斤；慈溪县五十二万亩两熟栽培棉田，每亩平均皮棉产量八十五斤。苏联先进的棉花生产，这一年全苏棉田的平均产量约为每亩皮棉八十三斤。说明我国提高棉花的单位产量，潜力是很大的。
    我国棉区分布很广，全国共有一千三百三十八个产棉的县（按有一百亩棉田以上的县为计算标准）。1955年棉花生产的基础，如果以县为单位来分析，有一千一百六十九个产棉县，共计棉田五千四百多万亩，每亩平均皮棉产量在四十斤以下，其中有一千一百六十三万亩棉田，每亩平均皮棉产量在二十斤以下；一百六十九个产棉县，共计棉田三千一百九十七万亩，每亩平均皮棉产量在四十斤以上，其中有二十二个县，棉田三百二十万亩，每亩平均皮棉产量在六十斤以上，最高的一个县，敦煌的平均产量达一百斤以上。根据这一情况，1955年有63.1％的棉田平均产量在四十斤以下，其中还有13.4％的棉田平均产量在二十斤以下；另外，平均产量在每亩皮棉四十斤以上到六十斤的棉田有33.2％，平均产量六十斤以上的棉田有3.7％，其中平均产量一百斤以上的一个县，棉田占0.06％。
    全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的棉花增产指标，就是在这样的基础上制订的。大面积平均亩产皮棉一百斤，过去在旧中国是从来不曾有过的，1955年已开始出现，这是今后棉花增产的奋斗目标。平均亩产皮棉八十斤、六十斤的也有出现，但为数也不多。1955年大部分棉区平均产量是在每亩皮棉二十斤至五十斤之间，因之，六十斤、八十斤、百斤可作为大部地区十二年内分别争取实现的增产指标。另外，还有一些地区因条件较差，产量很低，平均产量在每亩皮棉二十斤以下，甚至在每亩皮棉十斤以下，这些地区十二年内达到平均每亩皮棉四十斤，也是一个奋斗的指标。当然，平均亩产皮棉一百斤并不是一个最高的限额。
    今年全国已有五个县市棉田平均产量达到一百斤皮棉，有六个县市棉田平均产量达到八十斤皮棉，有四十一个县市达到六十斤皮棉。今年棉田平均产量超过四十斤以上的省、市，已有八个。今年各处大量出现的大面积丰产典型，充分说明农业发展纲要十二年棉花增产的指标是完全可能实现的。
