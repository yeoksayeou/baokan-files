　　Beware of Scarlet Fever
　　Guo Zitan
    Currently, it is the season for scarlet fever outbreaks. Most of those affected are children under the age of seven or eight. Because the scarlet fever pathogen—hemolytic streptococcus—and the toxins it produces can cause redness, swelling, and pain in the throat, as well as systemic poisoning symptoms such as fever, body aches, vomiting, and skin rashes, etc., it can also lead to sepsis and complications (otitis media, suppurative lymphadenitis, arthritis, and nephritis) in severe cases. This disease can seriously damage children's health, so prevention is essential; if the disease has already developed, it should be treated immediately.
    Scarlet fever, like measles, is an airborne droplet infection. When a patient or carrier coughs, sneezes, or speaks, the pathogen is sprayed out with saliva and enters the body of a healthy person through the upper respiratory tract (nasopharynx), which is called infection. Whether an infection leads to illness depends on factors such as the immunity and resistance of the person infected.
    Scarlet fever has a very rapid onset. During the epidemic season, if a child complains of a sore throat, suddenly has a high fever, vomits frequently, and has swollen neck lymph nodes, attention must be paid to observing the child's rash. If it is scarlet fever, generally within a day, red pinpoint rashes will appear sequentially from the neck, torso, and limbs, looking as if red ink has been applied, but they will fade when pressed with a finger; linear rashes can be seen in the folds of the armpits, elbows, and groin. At this time, the child's cheeks are flushed, but the area around the lips appears pale; soon, the tongue coating disappears, and the tongue papillae become red and swollen, resulting in a strawberry-like tongue. After about a week, the rash begins to subside and peel, with obvious large sheet peeling on the palms and soles of the feet.
    However, there are also many scarlet fever patients who only feel a sore throat and do not have a high fever, making it difficult to distinguish from tonsillitis and pharyngitis without bacterial diagnosis. This phenomenon is more common in older children and adults. Therefore, when a person is found to have symptoms of a sore throat, diagnosis and treatment should be carried out as soon as possible.
    In order to prevent and control scarlet fever, the following should also be done:
    1. The mucous membrane of the upper respiratory tract is the first line of defense against airborne droplet infections. We must protect its health, which requires preventing colds and influenza. Pay attention to oral hygiene; wear a mask when going out in cold weather to alleviate inflammation caused by cold air irritating the mucous membrane; children with chronic inflammation of the upper respiratory tract should be treated.
    2. Improve environmental hygiene and strengthen physical exercise. Scarlet fever is more prevalent in winter and spring, which is inseparable from crowded living conditions, poor ventilation, insufficient sunlight, and lack of attention to hygiene. You should do more outdoor exercise, breathe more fresh air, and get more sun. You should often eat foods containing vitamin C to increase resistance.
    3. If there is a scarlet fever patient living close by, as long as you don't take your children to visit the patient's home, don't borrow things from the patient's family, don't have contact with the mother serving the sick child, and pay attention to ventilating your own room, you generally will not be infected.
    4. After a scarlet fever patient is discovered, the epidemic prevention station should be notified immediately so that epidemic prevention personnel can go to the patient's home to help do a good job in preventing contact persons. For scarlet fever patients, penicillin is generally used for several days, and the bacteria can become negative. If there are many children in the family and there are no isolation conditions, the patient can be sent to the hospital to stay. If treated at home, the patient should be placed in a separate room or separated by a cloth curtain. The patient should drink plenty of water and eat liquid or semi-liquid foods. The floor, bedding, tables, chairs, and toys of the child in the sickroom are best disinfected with a 0.2% bleaching powder solution. Children who have been in contact with the patient should be observed for fever and sore throat within twelve days for timely treatment.
    After the patient is discharged from the hospital, they should rest at home for one to two weeks, and follow the doctor's instructions to regularly check the body's recovery status and whether there is a carrier state.

### 当心猩红热

　　当心猩红热
　　郭之潭
    目前是猩红热流行的季节。患病者大多数是七、八岁以下的儿童。由于猩红热病原体——溶血性链球菌及其所产生的毒素，可以引起咽喉的红肿疼痛以及全身中毒症状，如发热、全身疼、呕吐、出皮疹等等；严重时还可引起败血症和合并症（中耳炎、化脓性淋巴腺炎、关节炎和肾脏炎等）。这种病能使儿童健康遭到严重损害，因此必须注意预防；如果已经发病，要立即治疗。
    猩红热和麻疹一样，是空气飞沫传染病。病人或带菌人咳嗽、喷嚏、说话时，病原体随着吐沫星子喷出来，从上呼吸道（鼻咽部）侵入健康人的体内，这就称做感染。感染后发病与否，要看被感染人的免疫力和抵抗力等因素决定。
    猩红热发病很急。在流行季节里，如果孩子吵嚷嗓子痛、突然高烧、时有呕吐、脖子淋巴腺肿胀，这时必须注意观察病儿出疹情况。如果是猩红热，一般不超过一天，红色的点疹，就顺序地从颈部、躯干、四肢现出来，像涂了红墨水似的，但用手指一压就可退色；在腋窝、肘弯和大腿根的折沟，可看到线状疹。这时病儿颜面两颊绯红，口唇四周却显得苍白；不久，舌苔退尽，舌刺红肿，出现了杨梅似的舌头。一星期左右，皮疹开始消退、脱皮，手足心有明显大张脱皮。
    但是，也有许多猩红热患者，他们只觉得嗓子痛，热度并不高，如果不作细菌诊断，跟扁桃腺炎和咽峡炎很难分清楚。这种现象在年纪大一些的儿童和成年人中较多。因此，当发现有嗓子痛症状者，应尽速诊断和治疗。
    为了防治猩红热，还应做到以下几件事：
    一、上呼吸道粘膜是预防飞沫传染病的第一道防线，我们要保护它的健康，这就须要防止伤风、感冒。要注意口腔清洁；天冷出门时戴口罩，以缓和冷空气刺激粘膜发炎；儿童上呼吸道有慢性炎症的，要治疗。
    二、改善环境卫生，加强体质锻炼。猩红热多流行于冬春两季，这跟居住拥挤、通风不良、阳光不足和不注意卫生是分不开的。应该多做户外运动，多呼吸新鲜空气，常晒太阳。要常吃些含维生素丙的食物，以增加抵抗力。
    三、如同院紧邻有猩红热病人，只要不带孩子到病人家串门，不要和病家相互借用东西，不要同侍候病儿的母亲接触，同时注意自己居室通风，一般是不会被传染的。
    四、发现猩红热病人后，要马上向防疫站报告，以便防疫工作人员到病家帮助做好对接触者的预防工作。对猩红热病人，一般用青霉素治疗数日，病菌即可变成阴性。如果家庭孩子多，又没有隔离条件者，可把病人送到医院去住。若在家治疗，应把病人放在单独房间或用布幔隔开。病人要多喝水，吃流质或半流质食物。病室地面、寝具、桌椅和病儿的玩具等，最好用0.2％的漂白粉溶液消毒。接触过病人的儿童，应在十二天内注意观察他们有无发烧和嗓子痛等现象，以便及时处理。
    病人出院后，应在家休养一至二星期，并且按照医生的嘱咐，定期检查身体恢复状况和有无带菌状况。
