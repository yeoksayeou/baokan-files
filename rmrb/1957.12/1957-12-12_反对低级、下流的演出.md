　　Oppose Vulgar and Lewd Performances
　　On November 27th, when the Hebei Bangzi Opera Troupe of the Five-Star Theater from Xian County, Hebei Province, came to our factory to perform, some actors were extremely unserious on stage. This caused some plays with good themes to lose their educational significance and even gave people a feeling of disgust. For example, when they performed "Killing the Dog," the actor playing Diaoshi abused and beat her mother-in-law. After pushing her mother-in-law down, one actor straddled another actor, performing lewd actions. Diaoshi then stood up and kicked her mother-in-law, saying, "Kick you to death, you old fish tank, I won't let you raise 'loaches' anymore." At that time, many people in the audience cursed, "How disgusting." Later, the actor playing Diaoshi actually faced the audience and loudly said, "Comrades of the audience, if you die and are reborn, don't be reborn as women! We women, wash clothes, cook, make beds, pull covers, and fetch chamber pots during the day. If you wake up in the middle of the night and the man is in a good mood..." This, coupled with some vulgar expressions, appeared extremely vile. There were also many obscene lines and erotic performances elsewhere.
　　After this play was over, many people discussed it: "How absurd, so outrageous," "vulgar," "they ruined a good play," and "..." Everyone was extremely dissatisfied.
　　I believe that today's stage is a socialist platform. Actors educate the masses through their activities on stage, establish new moral qualities, sing the praises of righteous figures, satirize and attack ugly figures, and help the masses distinguish right from wrong, thereby serving the people and serving socialism. Why are there still such uncivilized and lewd actors in the Five-Star Opera Troupe?

　　反对低级、下流的演出
    11月27日，河北省献县五星河北梆子剧团来我厂演出时，有些演员在舞台上表演极不严肃，使一些主题较好的剧目失掉了教育意义，还给人一种厌恶的感觉。例如他们在演“杀狗”的时候，演刁氏欺打婆母，把她的婆母推倒后，一个演员就骑在另一个演员身上，表演下流的动作。刁氏站起来又踹婆母一脚说：“踹死你这老养鱼缸，再也不让你养‘泥鳅’”。当时，台下很多人就骂“真讨厌”。后来，这位扮演刁氏的演员竟然又面向观众大声说：“观众同志们哪，死了投生可不要再投妇女呀，我们妇女，白天洗衣、作饭，夜晚叠床、拉被还拿尿壶，要是睡到半夜醒来，男人要是高了兴呀，……”再加上一些庸俗的表情显得十分恶劣。其他还有很多台词淫秽，表演色情的地方。
    这出戏演完后，很多人随之就议论纷纷：“多荒唐，太不像话了”、“流气”、“好戏也让他们演坏了”“……”大家不满极了。
    我认为，今天的舞台是社会主义讲坛。演员通过在舞台上的活动来教育群众，树立新的道德品质，歌唱正义人物，讽刺和打击丑恶人物，帮助群众明辨是非，从而为人民，为社会主义服务。为什么在五星剧团里，却还有这样不讲文明的下流的演员呢？北京清河砖瓦厂　白云
