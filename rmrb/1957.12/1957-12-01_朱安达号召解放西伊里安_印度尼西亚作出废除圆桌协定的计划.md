　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 30th. Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda delivered a radio address to the Indonesian people tonight, calling on the nation to concentrate its efforts and maintain a strong fighting spirit, taking "another path" outside the United Nations General Assembly to fight for the liberation of West Irian.

　　Djuanda pointed out that this path is a path of struggle based on Indonesia's own strength.

　　Djuanda said that the United Nations General Assembly's rejection of the proposal on the West Irian issue made us more clearly realize that colonialism, especially Dutch colonialism, has not come to its senses in the face of reality.

　　At a meeting held on the evening of the 29th, the Indonesian cabinet approved Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Djuanda's instructions on measures for the struggle to liberate West Irian, and extensively discussed the possible countermeasures that Dutch colonialists might take in the struggle to liberate West Irian.

　　The cabinet also decided to strengthen the leadership of the West Irian Liberation Action Committee, and decided to send the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Labor, the Minister of Veterans Affairs, and the Minister of Manpower Mobilization and Construction to participate in this committee. The chairman of this committee is Minister of Information Sudibjo.

　　In addition, the Indonesian National Construction Conference unanimously adopted a proposal on the struggle to recover West Irian on the evening of the 29th. This proposal expressed full agreement with the resolution of the mass meeting held in Jakarta on November 18th. This resolution demands that the Indonesian government take steps such as confiscating all important Dutch-owned enterprises in Indonesia and prohibiting Dutch people from entering Indonesia to realize the demands of the Indonesian people if the United Nations General Assembly fails to resolve the West Irian issue satisfactorily.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 29th. Indonesian First Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister Hardi said in the National Assembly on the evening of the 28th that if the struggle to recover West Irian within the United Nations ultimately fails, the Indonesian government will take "other measures" to recover West Irian. The government has made concrete plans to abolish the Round Table Agreement.

　　In Surabaya, the second largest city in Indonesia and the capital of East Java Province, a movement to boycott Dutch expatriates has been launched since the 28th under the auspices of the East Java Army and Youth Cooperation Organization. So far, employees in urban transportation, postal and telecommunications, theaters and cinemas, hotels and restaurants, and swimming pools have participated in this movement. There are reports that Malang, another major city in East Java Province, also began a similar boycott movement on the 28th.

　　朱安达号召解放西伊里安
　　印度尼西亚作出废除圆桌协定的计划
    新华社雅加达30日电　印度尼西亚总理朱安达在今天晚上向印度尼西亚全国人民发表广播演说，号召全国人民集中力量并且保持旺盛的战斗精神，采取联合国大会以外的“另一条途径”为解放西伊里安而斗争。
    朱安达指出，这条途径是在印度尼西亚自己的力量的基础上进行斗争的途径。
    朱安达说：联合国大会否决了关于西伊里安问题的提案这件事使我们更加清楚地认识到，殖民主义特别是荷兰殖民主义并没有在现实面前清醒起来。
    印度尼西亚内阁在29日晚间举行的会议上，通过了总理兼国防部长朱安达关于解放西伊里安斗争的措施的指示，并且广泛地讨论了在解放西伊里安的斗争中荷兰殖民者可能采取的对策的问题。
    内阁还决定加强对解放西伊里安行动委员会的领导，决定派司法部长、劳工部长、退伍军人事务部长和人力动员建设部长参加这个委员会。这个委员会的主席是情报部长苏迪比约。
    另外，印度尼西亚全国建设会议在29日晚间一致通过了关于争取收复西伊里安的斗争的建议。这项建议表示完全同意11月18日在雅加达举行的群众大会的决议。这项决议要求印度尼西亚政府在联合国大会不能满意地解决西伊里安问题时，采取没收荷兰在印度尼西亚的一切重要企业和禁止荷兰人进入印度尼西亚等步骤，来实现印度尼西亚人民的要求。
    新华社雅加达29日电　印度尼西亚第一副总理兼代理外交部长哈迪28日晚间在国会上说，如果在联合国内争取收复西伊里安的斗争终于失败，印度尼西亚政府就将采取“其他办法”去收复西伊里安。政府已经作出了具体实现废除圆桌协定的计划。
    在印度尼西亚的第二大城市、东爪哇省的泗水，在东爪哇陆军和青年合作组织的主持下，从28日起开展了一个抵制荷兰侨民的运动。到目前为止，城市交通、邮电、戏院和电影院、饭店和酒店，以及游泳池的从业人员都已经参加了这个运动。有消息说，东爪哇省的另一个大城市玛琅也从28日开始开展了类似的抵制运动。
