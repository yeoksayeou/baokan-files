　　Purple Mountain Observatory Discovers
　　An Asteroid Close to the Sun
　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 9th — The Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has discovered an asteroid close to the sun – Zijin No. 6. The average distance between an asteroid and the sun is about 2.7 astronomical units (one astronomical unit is equivalent to the average distance from the Earth to the Sun). The average radius of Zijin No. 6’s orbit around the sun is less than two astronomical units.
　　Asteroids are located outside the Earth's orbit and revolve around the sun. Since the first asteroid, "Ceres," was discovered by Italian astronomer Piazzi in 1801, more than 1,600 asteroids have been discovered worldwide. The largest, "Ceres," has a diameter of 770 kilometers, and the smallest has a diameter of only 1 kilometer. They cannot be seen with the naked eye, and are difficult to track and observe even with astronomical telescopes. Zijin No. 6 was found by Zhang Yuzhe, director of the Purple Mountain Observatory, and young technician Zhang Jiaxiang using astronomical telescope photography.
　　Since 1955, the Purple Mountain Observatory has discovered four asteroids, Zijin No. 1 to Zijin No. 4. Zijin No. 5 was discovered in late October this year, and Zijin No. 6 was discovered in mid-November. The asteroid "Chunghua," discovered by Zhang Yuzhe, director of the Purple Mountain Observatory, in 1928, which had been missing for nearly 30 years, was also rediscovered at the end of October this year.

### 紫金山天文台发现一颗靠近太阳的小行星

    紫金山天文台发现
　  一颗靠近太阳的小行星
    据新华社南京9日电　中国科学院紫金山天文台发现一颗靠近太阳的小行星——紫金六号。一般小行星和太阳的距离平均约有二点七个天文单位（一个天文单位相当于地球到太阳的平均距离），紫金六号绕太阳运行轨道的平均半径还不到两个天文单位。
    小行星处在地球轨道以外，绕太阳运行。从1801年意大利天文学家皮阿齐发现第一颗小行星“谷神星”到现在，全世界已发现一千六百多颗小行星，最大的“谷神星”直径七百七十公里，最小的直径只一公里，都不能用肉眼看到，用天文望远镜也很难跟踪观测。紫金六号是紫金山天文台台长张钰哲和青年技术员张家祥利用天文望远镜照相方法找到的。
    紫金山天文台1955年以来先后发现了紫金一号到紫金四号等四颗小行星，今年10月下旬发现紫金五号，11月中旬发现了紫金六号。紫金山天文台台长张钰哲在1928年发现的小行星“中华号”，失踪近三十年，也在今年10月底重新找到。
