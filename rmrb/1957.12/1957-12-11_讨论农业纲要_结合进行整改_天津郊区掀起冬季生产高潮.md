Discuss the Agricultural Program, Combine it with Rectification
　　Tianjin Suburbs Launch a Winter Production Upsurge

　　(Our report) The rectification and socialist education movement in the townships and agricultural cooperatives of the Tianjin suburbs entered the stage of focusing on rectification in mid-November. In the past half month, the townships and cooperatives have widely mobilized the masses to discuss the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program and formulate production plans for 1958; and, according to the opinions raised by the broad masses of farmers in the airing of views, they have begun to rectify issues such as grain supply, cadre work style, and the management of agricultural cooperatives.

　　When discussing the revised draft of the Agricultural Development Program, the townships and cooperatives generally started by discussing the articles that were most closely related to the development of agricultural production in their respective townships and cooperatives. The masses were very enthusiastic, and after reaching consensus on many issues through discussion, they immediately took action. Some cadres of the Xixiaozhan Township agricultural cooperative raised the issue of lacking fertilizer sources. A debate on "Are there fertilizer sources?" "Can the fertilizer accumulation task be completed?" unfolded within the cooperative. As a result, the masses found twelve sources of fertilizer and also exposed shortcomings such as the unreasonable fertilizer accumulation quotas of the past. The cooperative immediately revised the quotas and announced the time for purchasing accumulated fertilizer. Consequently, the fertilizer accumulation movement was launched, and one-third of the base fertilizer needed for next year has already been accumulated. The Xinxing Township originally had limited land and a large population, and many agricultural cooperative members were not content with agricultural production. They were unwilling to cultivate the wasteland allocated to them by the district. During the discussion of the Program, the Party branch and the work team mobilized everyone to calculate three accounts: the patriotic thought account, the problem-solving account, and the production increase and income increase account. Everyone's understanding was raised, and then an upsurge in agricultural production was launched. Of the 476 laborers in two cooperatives throughout the township, an average of more than 280 laborers are now engaged in wasteland reclamation and canal construction every day, more than 100 laborers are engaged in sideline production, and about 80 laborers are engaged in fertilizer accumulation and other production activities. Liutan Township planned to increase the area of garden and paddy fields by 600 mu, requiring an investment of more than 20,000 yuan. The public accumulation of the cooperative could only solve half of it, and some people hoped to obtain loans from the state for the other half. After studying the Program, the cooperative cadres led the members to invest, and the funding problem was solved by themselves.

　　The cadres of the Mantianhong Agricultural Cooperative in Caozhuangzi Township accepted the criticism from the masses for not working in the fields. They led the cooperative members in discussing the Agricultural Development Program at night and took the lead in production during the day, which made the masses very happy. Many cooperative members went to haul dirt and carry manure for fertilizer accumulation after the meeting at night. The elderly and infirm cooperative members actively did light work in the vegetable gardens, freeing up the strong cooperative members to dig vegetable cellars and build water conservancy projects.

　　During the airing of views, some people in various townships raised the issue of insufficient grain. Many farmers also felt that the past practice of supplying grain equally based on population was unreasonable. After the transition to rectification, the townships organized special personnel to promote the method of grain supply based on human classification and quantitative supply. Most townships have implemented this supply method starting in December.

　　The townships and cooperatives are also starting to improve the management of agricultural cooperatives based on the principles of democratic management and running cooperatives diligently and frugally. Some cooperatives are already discussing and formulating plans for implementing the system of contracting work, output, and expenditure for production teams.

　　Debate and rectification have vigorously promoted the upsurge of farmers building farmland water conservancy and accumulating fertilizer. The original plan for the city's suburbs to expand the cultivated and irrigated area by more than 90,000 mu this winter and next spring has now been increased to more than 250,000 mu. Currently, from the Heizhu River bank in Tanggu District in the east to the Daxida Depression in Jinxia in the west, from the Machang Jianhe River in the south to the Jinzhong Riverbank in the north, tens of thousands of farmers in the Tianjin suburbs are stepping up wasteland reclamation and canal excavation. They are striving to complete this year's earthwork project for farmland water conservancy construction before the ground freezes; and strive to accumulate one-half to two-thirds of the base fertilizer needed for next year before the end of the year.

### 讨论农业纲要　结合进行整改  天津郊区掀起冬季生产高潮

　　讨论农业纲要　结合进行整改
    天津郊区掀起冬季生产高潮
    本报讯　天津郊区各乡、各农业社的整风和社会主义教育运动，是从11月中旬转入着重整改阶段的。近半月来，各乡社又广泛发动群众讨论全国农业发展纲要修正草案，制定1958年的生产计划；并根据广大农民在鸣放当中提出来的意见，着手整顿粮食供应、干部作风、农业社的经营管理等问题。
    各乡、社在讨论农业发展纲要修正草案的时候，一般都首先讨论与本乡本社发展农业生产关系最密切的条文，群众情绪非常热烈，许多问题经过讨论取得一致意见后，就立即行动起来了。西小站乡农业社部分干部提出没有肥源的问题，在社里就展开了一场“有没有肥源？”“能不能完成积肥任务？”的大辩论。结果，群众找出了十二种肥源，还揭露了过去积肥定额不合理等缺点。社里立即修改了定额，公布了收购积肥的时间，于是，积肥运动就开展起来了，现在已积存了明年所需底肥的三分之一。新兴乡原来地少人多，许多农业社员不安心于农业生产，区里分给他们的荒地也不愿去开，在讨论纲要的时候，党支部和工作组发动大家算了三笔账：爱国思想账；解决困难账；增产增收账。大家提高了认识，接着便掀起了农业生产热潮：全乡两个社共有四百七十六个劳动力，现在平均每天开荒和修渠的就有二百八十多个劳动力，进行副业生产的有一百多个劳动力，积肥和搞其他生产的有八十来个劳动力。柳滩乡计划增开园田和水田六百亩，需投资二万多元，社里的公共积累只能解决一半，那一半有的人指望向国家贷款，经过学习纲要以后，社干部带动社员投资，资金问题就自己解决了。
    曹庄子乡满天红农业社的干部，接受了群众对他们不下地干活的批评，夜间领导社员讨论农业发展纲要，白天带头搞生产，群众非常高兴。许多社员在夜间开完会以后，还去拉脏土、担粪积肥。这个社的老弱社员积极到菜园里做轻活，腾出壮年社员去挖菜窖和修水利工程。
    在鸣放当中，各乡都有人提出粮食不够吃的问题，许多农民对过去在粮食供应上实行平均计口售粮的办法也认为不合理。转入整改以后，各乡组织专人，推行了粮食以人分等、定量供应的办法。各乡大都从12月份起，实行了这个供应的办法。
    各乡、社并着手根据民主办法、勤俭办社的方针改进农业社的经营管理，有的社已在讨论和制定生产队实行包工包产包开支的方案。
    辩论和整改有力地推进了农民群众兴修农田水利和积肥的热潮。全市郊区原订在今冬明春扩大开荒和灌溉面积九万多亩的计划，现已增订为二十五万多亩。目前，天津郊区东至塘沽区黑猪河岸，西到津西大洼，南至马厂减河，北至金钟河畔，成千成万的农民正在加紧开荒挖渠，他们要争取在土地上冻以前，完成今年兴修农田水利的土方工程任务；并争取在年底以前积存好明年所需底肥的一半到三分之二。
