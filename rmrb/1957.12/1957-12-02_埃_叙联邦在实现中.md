　　The Realization of the Egyptian-Syrian Federation
　　Feng Zhidan
    The Syrian Parliament and the forty members of the Egyptian National Assembly's delegation to Syria unanimously passed a resolution on November 18, requesting the two governments to hold immediate negotiations to discuss the establishment of the Egyptian-Syrian Federation. This resolution will powerfully promote the Egyptian-Syrian Federation plan from an ideal into reality.
    As early as over a year ago, the Syrian government and parliament proposed the plan to establish the Egyptian-Syrian Federation. In July last year, the governments of Syria and Egypt held preliminary talks, and Syria established a special agency to handle this issue. In August, Syria drafted a draft for the establishment of the federation. The draft stipulated that Syria and Egypt would form a federal legislative assembly to formulate a federal constitution. Federal affairs would include political, military, economic, and cultural aspects. The draft suggested forming a federal executive committee to implement and supervise common policies in political, military, economic, and cultural affairs. The draft suggested forming a federal supreme court to make decisions on possible disputes between the two sides of the federation and forming a joint military command and federal supreme defense council to guide the federation's defense and military activities. The federation would have a president whose term would be two years, alternately held by Syria and Egypt. The federation would also have unified diplomatic missions in various countries around the world, and the president would have the right to appoint diplomatic envoys to foreign countries. The people of the two countries would have federal nationality, enabling them to travel, work, reside, and own property freely within the boundaries of the federation. The internal affairs of the federal state would remain independent.
    Due to the outbreak of the Anglo-French and Israeli war of aggression against Egypt last year, the talks on the Egyptian-Syrian Federation were temporarily suspended. In January this year, with the failure of the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt and the increasing threat of U.S. imperialism to the Arab national independence movement, the issue of the Egyptian-Syrian Federation was once again placed on the agenda of the two governments. The Syrian government dispatched a ministerial-level three-member delegation to discuss the establishment of the federation with Egypt. Subsequently, Syria sent a parliamentary delegation to discuss the federation issue with Egyptian President Nasser and suggested the establishment of a joint committee to formulate the details of the federation's institutional composition, and then prepare a report for the two governments for the formal signing of an agreement.
    The Egyptian-Syrian Federation plan reflects the common will of the two countries. Syria and Egypt are not only Arab nations, sharing a common language and customs, and having historically suffered nearly four hundred years of enslavement under the Ottoman Empire and the long-term rule of Western colonialism afterward, but also in the joint struggle against imperialist aggression, for maintaining Arab national independence, and for defending peace in the Middle East today, the peoples of Syria and Egypt are closely linked. When Egypt was in a serious crisis of suffering from Anglo-French and Israeli aggression, Syria fully supported Egypt's struggle, immediately severing diplomatic relations with Britain and France and cutting off the oil pipelines of the aggressor countries within Syria. And when Syria was threatened by aggression from the United States and Turkey, Egypt expressed the same fraternal support. Especially at present, when U.S. imperialism is carrying out a frenzied attack on the Arab national independence movement, Syria and Egypt, as the backbone of Arab nationalism, need even more urgently to strengthen their unity and joint action.
    In fact, due to the needs of the common struggle against colonialism, Syria and Egypt have already formed a concrete alliance in many affairs. In the military aspect, the two countries signed a joint defense treaty as early as October 20, 1955. According to this treaty, the two sides agreed to establish three institutions, namely, the Supreme Council, the Military Committee, and the Joint Armed Forces Command. The current first commander-in-chief of the Egyptian-Syrian Joint Armed Forces Command is Major General Abdel Hakim Amer, the Egyptian Minister of Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. On October 13 this year, the Cairo headquarters of the Joint Armed Forces Command announced that Egyptian troops had entered Syria. The troops of the two countries will, under the command of a unified command, fight against possible aggression against Syria by Turkish and Israeli troops under the instigation of U.S. imperialism. In the economic aspect, the two countries signed an economic alliance agreement in September this year. Subsequently, Egypt established a special committee to study ways to realize this economic alliance. On November 13, the two countries further signed new trade and payment agreements, stipulating that many agricultural products will be exempt from tariffs in future trade between the two countries, and also stipulating that the tariffs on goods mutually bought and sold between the two countries will be reduced by 25% to 50%. In addition, there are reports that the Syrian government has instructed a committee including representatives from the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to formulate a plan for free travel between Syria and Egypt, and the abolition of passports and visas. All of these can be seen as preparatory steps for the establishment of the Egyptian-Syrian Federation.
    The idea of Arab national unity is formed in the long struggle of Arab countries against foreign oppression. Historically, the Arab nation was originally a powerful unified entity, but in the four hundred years since the sixteenth century, under the separatist rule of Turkish conquerors, the division between the various Arab tribes was formed. After the First World War, when the Arabs freed themselves from the shackles of Turkish oppression, the Western colonialists adopted a divide-and-rule strategy to re-enslave the Arab nation. Whether in the struggle against Turkish oppressors or in the struggle against Western colonialism, the Arabs deeply felt the necessity of unified action. With the victory of the Arab national independence movement, the idea of Arab national unity has been widely spread. The establishment of the Arab League in 1945 was the result of the promotion of this idea. The charter of the League stipulates: "The purpose of the League is to make the relations between member states closer and to coordinate their political activities in order to achieve close cooperation between them; to defend their independence and sovereignty; and to comprehensively consider the affairs and interests of Arab countries." The currently proposed Egyptian-Syrian Federation fully conforms to the common aspirations of the Arab nation.
    However, imperialists have always hated the unity and union of Arab countries. They have tried every means to conspire to divide the unity of Arab countries. The establishment of the Baghdad Pact Group was to achieve this division. At the same time, U.S. and British imperialists also attempted to use the Arab people's desire for unity to propose what "Greater Syria Plan" (i.e., the federation of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan) and "Eastern Arab League" and other tricks to induce Arab countries to fall into the trap of imperialism. After the news of the establishment of the Egyptian-Syrian Federation came out, Iraq was busy wooing Jordan, and Iraqi political figures frequently visited Jordan and openly promoted the establishment of the Iraqi-Jordanian Federation. However, any so-called "alliance" between Arab countries under the manipulation of U.S. and British imperialism can only be a tool for them to enslave the Arab nation.
    There is no doubt that the road pointed out by the Egyptian-Syrian Federation plan will lead to the true unity of the Arab nation. As Syrian President Kuwatli said, "The establishment of the Egyptian-Syrian Federation will be the prelude to Arab unity." (Attached picture)
    On November 16, thousands of Syrian people warmly welcomed the Egyptian parliamentary delegation that came to discuss the establishment of the Egyptian-Syrian Federation at the Damascus airport. The slogan on the sign reads: "Long live the Egyptian-Syrian alliance!"　　　　Xinhua News Agency reporter Jin Kengran photo

　　埃—叙联邦在实现中
　　冯之丹
    叙利亚议会和埃及国民议会访叙代表团的四十名议员在11月18日的联席会议上一致通过了一项决议，要求两国政府立即举行谈判，讨论成立埃及—叙利亚联邦问题。这个决议将有力地促使埃—叙联邦计划从理想变成现实。
    早在一年多以前，叙利亚政府和议会就提出了建立埃—叙联邦的计划。去年7月间，叙、埃两国政府曾举行了初步会谈，叙利亚并成立了一个专门机构处理这个问题。8月间，叙利亚曾经拟定了建立联邦的草案。草案规定，叙利亚和埃及将组成一个联邦立法议会，制定一部联邦宪法。联邦事务将包括政治、军事、经济和文化等方面。草案建议组成一个联邦执行委员会来执行和监督政治、军事、经济和文化事务等方面的共同政策。草案建议组成一个联邦最高法院，以便在联邦双方间可能发生的分歧上作出决定，并组成一个联合军事司令部和联邦最高防务委员会以指导联邦的防务及军事活动。联邦设总统，其任期将为两年，由叙利亚和埃及轮流担任。联邦还将有驻世界各国的统一的外交使团，总统有权任命驻外国外交使节。两国人民将具有联邦国籍，使他们能够在联邦的疆界以内自由来往、工作、居住和拥有财产。联邦国家的内政保持独立。
    由于去年英法和以色列侵略埃及的战争爆发，关于埃—叙联邦的会谈暂告中断。今年1月间，随着英法侵埃战争的失败和美帝国主义对阿拉伯民族独立运动威胁的加剧，埃—叙联邦问题又重新提到两国政府的议事日程上来。叙利亚政府曾经委派了一个部长级的三人代表团同埃及讨论建立联邦问题。随后，叙利亚派遣了议会代表团和埃及总统纳赛尔讨论了联邦问题，并建议成立一个联合委员会制定联邦机构组成的细节，然后为两国政府准备报告以便正式签订协定。
    埃—叙联邦计划反映了两国的共同意志。叙利亚和埃及不仅同是阿拉伯民族，有着共同的语言和风习，并在历史上共同遭受过奥图曼帝国的将近四百年的奴役和以后西方殖民主义的长期统治，而且在今天反对帝国主义侵略、维护阿拉伯民族独立和保卫中东和平的联合斗争中，叙埃两国人民也是休戚相关的。当埃及处于遭受英法和以色列侵略的严重关头，叙利亚全力支持了埃及的斗争，它立即断绝了与英法的外交关系，切断了侵略国家在叙利亚境内的输油管。而当叙利亚遭到美国和土耳其侵略威胁的时候，埃及表示了同样的兄弟般的支持。特别是在目前，当美帝国主义向阿拉伯民族独立运动实行疯狂进攻的时候，作为阿拉伯民族主义的中坚力量的叙利亚和埃及，就更加迫切地需要加强它们之间的联合和统一行动。
    事实上，由于反对殖民主义的共同斗争的需要，叙利亚和埃及之间在许多事务方面已经形成了具体的联盟。在军事方面，两国早在1955年10月20日就签订了共同防御条约。根据这个条约，双方同意建立三个机构，即最高委员会、军事委员会和联合武装部队司令部。现任埃—叙联合武装部队司令部首任总司令是埃及国防部长兼武装部队总司令阿卜杜勒·哈基姆·阿密尔少将。今年10月13日，两国联合武装部队司令部开罗总部宣布，埃及军队开进叙利亚。两国军队将在统一的司令部指挥下，打击可能发生的在美帝国主义指使下的土耳其和以色列军队对叙利亚的侵略。在经济方面，今年9月间，两国签订了经济联盟协定。接着埃及成立了专门委员会研究实现这一经济联盟的办法。11月13日两国进一步签署了新的贸易协定和支付协定，规定在两国今后的贸易交往中，许多农产品将免除关税，同时还规定把两国相互买卖的商品的关税减少25％到50％。此外，有消息说，叙利亚政府已经指示包括内政部和外交部代表的一个委员会，拟订在叙埃两国间自由来往，取消护照和签证的方案。所有这些，都可以被看作是建立埃—叙联邦的准备步骤。
    阿拉伯民族团结和统一的思想，是阿拉伯各国在长期反抗外来压迫的斗争中形成起来的。历史上，阿拉伯民族本来是一个强大的统一体，自从十六世纪以来的四百年中，在土耳其征服者的割据统治下，形成了阿拉伯各族之间的分裂。第一次世界大战以后，当阿拉伯人从土耳其压迫的枷锁下摆脱出来的时候，西方殖民主义者又采用了分而治之的手段，重新奴役了阿拉伯民族。阿拉伯人无论在与土耳其压迫者的斗争中，在与西方殖民主义的斗争中，都深切地感到统一行动的必要性。随着阿拉伯民族独立运动的胜利，阿拉伯民族统一的思想也就得到了广泛的传播。1945年阿拉伯国家联盟的建立就是这种思想推动的结果。联盟在宪章中规定：“联盟的宗旨为：使会员国间的关系更加密切，并为了实现彼此间的紧密合作而协调彼等的政治活动；保卫彼等的独立和主权；以及全面考虑阿拉伯国家的事务和利益。”目前拟议中的埃—叙联邦完全符合于阿拉伯民族的共同愿望。
    但是，帝国主义者从来都仇视阿拉伯国家的团结和联合。它们千方百计地阴谋分裂阿拉伯国家的团结。巴格达条约集团的建立就是为了达到这种分化的目的。同时，美英帝国主义者也企图利用阿拉伯人要求联合的愿望，提出了什么“大叙利亚计划”（即伊拉克、叙利亚、黎巴嫩和约旦联邦）和“东阿拉伯联盟”等等诡计，以诱使阿拉伯国家落入帝国主义的圈套。在关于建立埃—叙联邦的消息传出后，伊拉克便忙于拉拢约旦，伊拉克的政界要人纷纷访问约旦，并公开宣扬建立伊—约联邦。但是，在美英帝国主义操纵下的任何阿拉伯国家间的所谓“联盟”，只能是它们奴役阿拉伯民族的一个工具。
    毫无疑问，埃—叙联邦计划所指出的道路，将通向阿拉伯民族的真正的团结。正如叙利亚总统库阿特利所说，“埃—叙联邦的成立，将是阿拉伯团结的序幕。”（附图片）
