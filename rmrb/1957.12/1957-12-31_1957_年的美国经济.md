    The US Economy in 1957
    Ji Long
    (I)
    The US economy in 1957 presented a bleak and stagnant picture from the start. This situation never improved, and from September and October, it began a significant decline. This decline appears likely to continue into 1958. Most American business people and economic researchers admit that a worrying and possibly quite serious economic recession has now begun.
    The following main aspects can provide a general outline:
    (1) Industrial Production Index: While the annual industrial production index in the US in 1956 had ups and downs, the general trend was upward. In 1957, it was a clear decline. The table below shows the changes in the industrial production index for the two years.
    Industrial Production Index (1947-1949 = 100)
            1956　　　1957
      January　　143　　　146
      February　　143　　　146
      March　　141　　　145
      April　　143　　　143
      May　　141　　　143
      June　　141　　　144
      July　　136　　　144
      August　　143　　　145
      September　　144　　　144
     October　　146　　　142
     November　　146　　　139
     December　　147　　　——
    Recent reports from all sides indicate that orders received in industry are decreasing, order cancellations are increasing, backlogs of unfilled orders are decreasing, retailers are reducing purchases, and manufacturers' inventories are soaring. Reduction measures are being used to reduce inventory. All this indicates that industrial production will continue to decline. According to the estimate of Rezick, editor of the American Commerce Daily, the index may fall to 130 by early summer 1958.
      (2) Gross National Product: It is not yet possible to calculate the GNP for the whole of 1957, but it is generally estimated at $435 billion, which is still an increase over 1956, but the percentage increase has further decreased. This can be seen from the following comparison table:
         Gross National Product (hundred million US dollars)   Increase over previous year (hundred million US dollars) %1954　　　3612
1955　　　3917　                          　305　　8.51956　　　4147　　                          230　　5.91957 (estimated) 4350　　                        203　　4.9
    Herbert Koshetz, economic commentator for the "New York Times," believes that the largest part of the increase in GNP in 1957 was the result of rising prices, and that per capita income has already declined if calculated per population.
    (3) Personal Income: The total annual figure for US personal income in 1957 increased, but if we look at the annualized figures for each month, a downward trend is also reflected from September, the first consecutive decline in monthly estimated personal income since the end of the 1953-1954 recession. The annual rate of personal income in January 1957 was $335.9 billion, rising monthly to $346.8 billion in August. In September, it turned downward by $200 million, to $346.6 billion, and in October it fell again by $1 billion, to $345.6 billion. It can be roughly predicted that November will continue to decline.
    (4) Retail Trade: Began to decline in August. According to estimates released by the US Department of Commerce (seasonally adjusted), the situation in recent months is as follows:
          May　　16,644 (million US dollars)
          June　　16,783
          July　　17,034
          August　　17,030
          September　　16,919
         October　　16,561 (forecast)
    According to recent reports, retail trade continued to fall in November.
    (5) Unemployment: Comparing the figures for the most recent months of this year with the figures for the same period in 1956, the number of unemployed people in each month this year has increased compared with last year, and it is especially noteworthy that the number of unemployed people suddenly increased by 700,000 in November, bringing the total to 3.2 million, the highest record for the number of unemployed people in the same month since 1949.
                    1956　　1957
    September (hundreds)　 1,998　2,552
    October (hundreds)　1,909　2,508
    November (hundreds)　2,463　3,200 (estimated)
    According to estimates from both public and private sources in the US, the number of unemployed will continue to increase, and by the spring of 1958, it will increase to 4-5 million. If it reaches 5 million, it will be the highest number since August 1941.
    (II)
    We may as well examine the decline of the US economy in 1957 further from several important factors that have supported the US economy in recent years.
    1. Corporate Capital Expenditure: At the end of 1956, companies budgeted approximately $39 billion for capital expenditures in 1957. At the very beginning of 1957, the economic situation was not good, and many companies cut their budgets one after another, reducing, postponing, or stopping expansions or new constructions. Therefore, the actual figure for capital expenditure in 1957 is estimated at $37 billion, which can only maintain a limited increase compared with 1956. This is only because the large capital expenditure projects of the "boom" period have not yet been completed and must continue. Most of these larger capital expenditure plans were completed in 1957. The situation of US corporate capital expenditure in the last four years is roughly as follows; compared with 1956, the increasing trend in 1957 has greatly declined:
                        Increase over previous year
          (hundred million US dollars) (hundred million US dollars) (%)
    1954　　268
    1955　　287　　　19　　7
    1956　　351　　　64　　22
  1957　　370 (estimated) 19　　5.4
    According to the results of a survey of 499 companies by the National Industrial Conference Board of America, if we compare the capital expenditure appropriation figures for the third quarter of 1957 with the appropriation figures for the third quarter of 1956, capital expenditures in manufacturing decreased by 31%, with the largest declines in non-ferrous metal manufacturing (66%), transportation equipment manufacturing (57%), papermaking (62%), and the chemical industry (54%). Under this downward trend, the prospects for corporate capital expenditure in 1958 are very bleak. According to "Newsweek," many private surveys predict that corporate capital expenditure in 1958 will decrease by 5% to 10% compared with 1957, that is to say, the absolute figure of capital expenditure will also fall, and even a slight increase is less likely. This is a noteworthy situation.
    2. Residential Construction: Residential construction in 1957 decreased compared with 1956. In the first ten months of 1957, the value of new construction (including residential construction) increased by approximately 2% compared with 1956, but if price increases are excluded, the total actually does not increase. Moreover, 1957 mainly relied on government and corporate construction, and the situation of private residential construction was not good. A comparison of the number of private new residential buildings in recent years can show this:
        1955　　1,328,000 units
        1956　　1,120,000 units
        1957　　1,000,000 units (estimated)
    The situation in the first half of private residential construction was worse than the current estimate, and improved somewhat after autumn and winter. However, if the US economy has a further overall decline in 1958, it is very questionable whether residential construction can remain unchanged on its own. It has already appeared that middle-income families cannot even afford the cheapest house for sale.
    3. Automobile Production: The production and sales of automobiles have become one of the important factors in the US economy today. In 1956, some people optimistically estimated that 6.5 million cars could be sold in 1957. The actual situation in the first half of 1957 greatly disappointed them; however, the automobile industry still had great hopes for the new cars launched in the second half of the year, and as a result, the prosperous phenomenon of gradual increase in sales that should have occurred after the new cars came out did not appear as usual. In November, new car sales were approximately 4% lower than in 1956. As of November 1, 1957, there were 464,000 new cars in the hands of managers, while on the same day in 1956, there were 278,000, indicating a significant backlog of sales.
    4. Government Spending: The US economy currently relies on huge government spending. The following figures can provide a general outline:
        Federal government cash    State and local government cash  Total    Percentage of GNP
       Expenditure (hundred million US dollars)   Expenditure (hundred million US dollars) (hundred million US dollars)  Total value %1953　　768          　　301           　1,069     　　29.91954　　719　          　337　           1,056　       29.41955　　705              372　           1,077　     　28.91956　　726　　          416           　1,142　　     28.41957 (early estimate) 783　  　448　         　1,231　       29.2
    It can also be seen from the figures in the above table that the expenditures of governments at all levels have been increasing every year for the past three years. In terms of its proportion of GNP, it also increased in 1957 compared with 1955 and 1956. Now, the American ruling group is using the fact that the Soviet Union launched artificial satellites as an excuse to clamor for a large increase in military expenditures to step up arms expansion and war preparations. According to reports, the 1957-1958 fiscal year has been determined to overspend, and the budget for military expenditures will be greatly increased in the 1958-1959 fiscal year. It seems that the American ruling group is attempting to use continuously increasing military expenditures to resist the economic downturn that has already appeared.
    5. Foreign Trade: In terms of the entire year of 1957, exports increased, and it is estimated to be nearly $20 billion, which is an increase compared with $18.9 billion in 1956. However, the exports in the second half of 1956 and the early period of 1957 were quite dependent on the interruption of the Suez Canal and the poor harvests in Western Europe, which created Europe's need for oil and agricultural products. These two major factors did not play a role after March and April of this year. At the same time, many European countries reduced their imports of American goods due to economic difficulties. Therefore, the US export trade has been declining since April 1957. According to quarterly statistics, it has also declined in all quarters of the year. According to estimates by the New York Chemical Corn Exchange Bank, US export trade will decline by 5% in 1958, and the American economic community generally agrees with this estimate. The London "Financial Times" once pointed out that although US exports only account for 5% of GNP, its decline will be a serious blow because exports are actually a key to solving the profit and loss problems of many US companies. "US News & World Report" said that according to official estimates in 1957, the number of people employed relying on exports is approximately 3 million to 4 million. Therefore, this less-than-pleasant prospect for export trade will be a very unfavorable factor for the increasingly declining US economy.
    (III)
    It can be seen from the above situation that the decline that has appeared in the US economy since the autumn of 1957 is not accidental, nor is it a temporary fluctuation. Currently, the number of unemployed people in the US is constantly increasing, the average weekly working hours and wages of the employed population are continuing to decline, consumer debt is still growing, personal income is declining, and both retail trade and export trade are trending downward, production is falling, and orders are shrinking. The entire picture shows signs of an economic recession. It is very clear that this is a concrete manifestation of the basic contradiction of capitalism: the contradiction between the huge growth of capitalist productive forces and the relative shrinkage of the needs of the broad masses of working people who have the ability to pay. The shrinkage of demand with the ability to pay is simply the decline of actual purchasing power. The situation in this regard has generally been introduced more in the past, and I do not intend to discuss it here. The excessive growth of productive forces is an important aspect of examining the capitalist economic crisis, that is, overproduction. Currently, some materials are sufficient to provide some clues.
    According to statistics from "US News & World Report," the average productivity of the 17 major industrial raw materials in the US—steel ingots, aluminum, copper, pig iron, cement, pulp, paper, paperboard, petroleum products, coking coal, cotton yarn, man-made fibers, and five industrial chemical raw materials—increased by 9% in the past two years, while output decreased by 5%. The relatively rapid increase in US productivity in recent years is also a major reason for the huge increase in corporate investment, but these increased productive forces do not have sufficient markets to support them, and when the economy declines, it makes the sales problem even more serious. Taking the US steel industry as an example, productivity has increased by 23% in the past five years. Currently, the annual productivity is 133.5 million tons, but the annual consumption in each year has never exceeded 117 million tons, and the operating rate in mid-December 1957 was only about 69%. Taking the US automobile industry as an example, calculated according to its current productivity, working six days a week and 52 weeks a year, it can produce 11 million cars of all sizes annually. Now the operating rate is only about two-thirds. In addition, many important industries in the US are showing insufficient operating rates, such as according to estimates from different periods in the second half of this year: the oil industry operating rate is 86%, aluminum smelting is 80%, copper smelting is 76%, synthetic rubber is 77%, and synthetic fibers are 78%. The cement industry is a particularly prominent example. It had a good time in 1955-1956, with an operating rate reaching 99%; however, good times do not last long. In 1957, on the one hand, due to excessive productivity improvement, and on the other hand, due to the absolute figure of production also falling, the operating rate plummeted to 82%.
    The December 1957 report by the European Economic Cooperation Organization on the US and Canadian economies for the 18 months ending in mid-1957 already pointed out: "In the past year, the US economy has been moving towards lower utilization of productivity in many sectors, and without possible actions by monetary or budget authorities, it is difficult to see any major forces that would promote re-expansion in the coming months." The well-known American economist Burns also emphasized that the large "surplus" of productivity in almost all major industrial sectors in the US is one of the important factors predicting that production contractions will become more serious and longer. The overproduction of productive forces is inseparable from overproduction, and it seems obvious that the US economy will continue to decline.
    (IV)
    The American ruling group did not make any efforts in 1957 to maintain the economy and prevent it from declining. The monetary policy of the American financial authorities this year is the best explanation. In order to prevent inflation from continuing, the US authorities insisted on a policy of moderately tightening the money supply in 1957, raised the discount rate again, and attempted to compress military expenditures when compiling and implementing the 1957-1958 budget to strive for a budget surplus. However, the result of the effort was tight credit, companies stopped expanding, commodity sales were sluggish, and production began to decline. Therefore, the discount rate had to be lowered again not long after it was raised, and military orders began to increase again. Humphrey, the Secretary of the Treasury, and Wilson, the Secretary of Defense, who advocated balancing the budget, reducing taxes, and increasing normal economic activities to stabilize the economy, resigned one after another. After the launch of the Soviet artificial satellite, the clamor for arms expansion and war preparations overwhelmed the proposal to try to take the normal "peaceful" economic road of capitalism. It seems that the American ruling group is still attempting to find a way out from arms expansion and war preparations. However, the facts are obvious that this road has been taken for several years, and the decline and the coming recession that appeared in 1957 are precisely the consequences of arms expansion and war preparations. Moreover, after World War II, due to the accumulation of American wartime purchasing power and the recovery of the Western European economy, it once helped the rise of the American economy at that time and slowed down the decline in certain periods. Now, the situation is different: in 1957, most capitalist countries in Europe also generally experienced economic declines. Most countries in the capitalist world lacked US dollars, production declined, and foreign trade shrank. These countries not only cannot help the US overcome difficulties, but also feel that they cannot protect themselves and are deeply afraid of being implicated by the US. Obviously, the method of replacing butter with cannons cannot solve the current serious economic problems in the US at all.

    1957年的美国经济
    纪隆
    （一）
    1957年的美国经济从一开始就呈现了黯淡和停滞的局面，这种局面始终没有好转，从9、10月间起则开始了显著的下降。这一下降看来将继续到1958年。大多数美国工商界人士和研究经济的人都承认目前已经开始出现一个值得忧虑的、并且可能是相当严重的经济衰退。
    下列几个主要方面的情况可以提供一个总的轮廓：
    （1）工业生产指数　1956年美国的全年工业生产指数虽然有起伏波动，但总的趋势还是上升的，而1957年则是很明显地下降。下表表现了前后两年工业生产指数的变化。
    工业生产指数（1947—1949＝100）
            1956　　　1957
      1月　　143　　　146
      2月　　143　　　146
      3月　　141　　　145
      4月　　143　　　143
      5月　　141　　　143
      6月　　141　　　144
      7月　　136　　　144
      8月　　143　　　145
      9月　　144　　　144
     10月　　146　　　142
     11月　　146　　　139
     12月　　147　　　——
    最近各方面的材料报道，工业方面接受订货减少，取消订货增加，未交货的订货量减少，销售商减少进货，制造业存货激增，正用减产办法来减低存货。这些都表明工业生产还要继续下降。据美国商务日报编辑列季克的估计，到1958年夏初指数可能降低到一百三十。
      （2）国民生产总值　现在还无法计算1957年全年的国民生产总值，但目前一般估计为四千三百五十亿美元，比1956年仍然是有所增加的，但是增加的百分比则进一步降低了。这可以从下面的比较表里看出：
         国民生产总值（亿美元）   较上年增加总值（亿美元）％1954　　　3612      1955　　　3917　                          　305　　8.51956　　　4147　　                          230　　5.91957（估计）4350　　                        203　　4.9
    “纽约时报”经济评论员赫伯特·柯谢兹认为1957年国民生产总值的增加最大部分是物价上涨的结果，如果依人口计算，每人所得平均数已经下降。
    （3）个人收入　1957年美国个人收入的全年数字是增加的，但是如果观察一下各月折成年率的数字来看，从9月份起也反映了下降的趋势，是美国1953—1954年衰退停止以后第一次出现按月估计的个人收入的连续下降。1957年1月个人收入年率为三千三百五十九亿美元，逐月上升，到8月为三千四百六十八亿美元，9月转而下跌二亿美元，为三千四百六十六亿美元，10月又下跌十亿美元，为三千四百五十六亿美元。大致可以推测，11月将继续下降。
    （4）零售贸易　从8月开始下降。据美国商务部发表的估计（经过季节调整），最近几个月的情况如下：
          5月　　16，644（百万美元）
          6月　　16，783
          7月　　17，034
          8月　　17，030
          9月　　16，919
         10月　　16，561（预估）
    据最近报道，11月的零售贸易在继续下跌。
    （5）失业人数　以今年最近几个月数字同1956年同期数字相比，今年各月失业人数比去年都有增加，而尤其值得注意的是11月失业人数突然增加七十万人，使总数激增至三百二十万人，是1949年以来同一个月失业人数的最高纪录。
                    1956　　1957
    9月（百人）　 1，998　2，552
    10月（百人）　1，909　2，508
    11月（百人）　2，463　3，200（估计）
    据美国公私各方面估计，失业人数将继续增加，到1958年春，将要增加到四百—五百万人。如果达到五百万人，将是1941年8月以来的最高数字。
    （二）
    我们不妨从近几年来作为对美国经济起着支持作用的几个重要因素来进一步考察1957年美国经济的下降。
    一、企业资本支出　1956年底时各企业对1957年的资本支出预算约为三百九十亿美元。1957年刚一开始，经济情况就不妙，许多企业纷纷削减预算，缩小、推迟或停止扩充或新建。因此，1957年资本支出的实际数字据估计为三百七十亿美元，比1956年仅能保持有限的上升，这只是由于“繁荣”时期的资本支出大工程尚未完工、必须继续进行的缘故。而这些较大的资本支出计划在1957年大多数都已完工。美国企业资本支出在最近四年的情况大致如下；同1956年比较，1957年的增加趋势是大大下降了：
                        较上年增加
          （亿美元）（亿美亿）（％）
    1954　　268
    1955　　287　　　19　　7
    1956　　351　　　64　　22
  1957　　370（估计）19　　5.4
    根据美国工业会议全国委员会向四百九十九家公司调查结果，如果拿1957年第三季度的资本支出拨款数字同1956年第三季度的拨款数字相比，制造业的资本支出下降31％，其中下降得最多的是非铁金属制造业（66％），运输设备制造业（57％），造纸业（62％），化学工业（54％）。在这种下降的趋势下，1958年的企业资本支出前景是十分黯淡的。据美国“新闻周刊”报道，许多私人企业的调查都预测1958年企业资本支出将较1957年下降5％到10％，也就是说，资本支出的绝对数字也将下跌，即使微弱的增加也少可能。这是一个值得注意的情况。
    二、住宅建筑　1957年的住宅建筑比起1956年是下降的。在1957年最初十个月内，新建筑（包括住宅建筑在内）的价值较1956年约增加2％，但如果除去物价上涨，总数实际上就没有什么增加。况且，1957年主要靠政府和企业建筑，私人住宅建筑情况并不好。将最近几年私人新建住宅建筑的数量作一比较就可以看出：
        1955　　1，328，000所
        1956　　1，120，000所
        1957　　1，000，000所（估计）
    私人住宅建筑上半年的情况比现在的估计数还要坏，秋冬以后有些好转。但是，如果美国经济在1958年有进一步的全面下降，住宅建筑是否能够单独保持不动，是很成问题的。目前已经出现，中等收入的家庭甚至买不起一座出售的最便宜的房子。
    三、汽车生产　汽车的生产和销售今天已经成为美国经济中的重要因素之一。在1956年曾经有人乐观地估计1957年小汽车可销六百五十万辆，1957年上半年的实际情况使他们十分失望；但是，汽车业对下半年问世的新车仍抱有很大希望，结果是照例新车出来以后应有的销路逐步上升的兴旺现象没有出现。就11月份来说，新车销售量低于1956年约4％。1957年11月1日新的小汽车在经理商手中的存货为四十六万四千辆，而1956年同日则为二十七万八千辆，有显著的滞销现象。
    四、政府开支　美国经济目前有赖于庞大的政府开支，下列数字可以提供一个大致的轮廓：
        联邦政府现金    州和地方政府现金  合计    占国民生产
       支出（亿美元）   支出（亿美元） （亿美元）  总值比例％1953　　768          　　301           　1，069     　　29.91954　　719　          　337　           1，056　       29.41955　　705              372　           1，077　     　28.91956　　726　　          416           　1，142　　     28.41957（年初估计）783　  　448　         　1，231　       29.2
    从上表数字还可以看出，各级政府的开支最近三年来每年都在增加。就它占国民生产总值的比例来说，1957年也较1955年和1956年有所增加。现在，美国统治集团正利用苏联发射了人造卫星这一事实作为借口，大吹大擂地要求大大增加军事开支，来加紧进行扩军备战。据报道，1957—1958年度已确定要超支，1958—1959年度要大大增加军事费用的预算。看来，美国统治集团是企图以不断增加的军事开支来抵住已经出现的经济上的下降趋势。
    五、对外贸易　就1957年全年来说，出口是增加的，估计将近二百亿美元，比1956年的一百八十九亿美元有所增加。但是，1956年下半年和1957年前期的出口相当得力于苏伊士运河的中断和西欧农业歉收所造成的欧洲对于石油和农产品的需要，这两大因素到今年3、4月以后就不起什么作用了，同时欧洲许多国家由于经济困难，都减少了美货的进口。所以，美国的出口贸易，从1957年4月份起一直下降，按季统计，全年各季也是下降的。据纽约化学谷物交易银行估计，1958年美国出口贸易将下降5％，美国经济界一般都同意这个估计。伦敦“金融时报”曾经指出：虽然美国出口仅占国民生产总值的5％，但是它的下降将是一个严重的打击，因为出口实际上是解决许多美国企业盈亏问题的一个关键。“美国新闻与世界报道”说，根据1957年官方的估计，依靠出口的就业人数约为三百万到四百万人。因此，出口贸易的这种并不美妙的前途，对于日趋下降的美国经济来说将是一个十分不利的因素。

    从以上情况可以看出，1957年入秋以后美国经济中所出现的下降不是偶然的，也不是短暂的波动。当前美国失业人数在不断增加，在业人口的每周平均工时和工资在继续下降，消费者债务仍在增长，个人收入下降，零售贸易和出口贸易都趋向下降，生产下跌，订货萎缩。整个图画表明了经济衰退的征象。很清楚，这是资本主义的基本矛盾的具体表现：资本主义生产力的巨大增长和广大劳动群众具有支付能力的需求相对缩小之间的矛盾。有支付能力的需求的缩小，简单地说，就是实际购买力的下降。关于这方面的情况过去一般介绍较多，在这里不打算讨论。关于生产力的过分增长，是考察资本主义经济危机，即生产过剩的一个重要方面，目前有些材料足以提供一些线索。
    据“美国新闻与世界报道”统计，美国的十七种主要工业原料——钢锭、铝、铜、生铁、水泥、纸浆、纸、纸板、石油产品、焦煤、棉纱、人造纤维和五种工业用化学原料——在过去两年内平均生产力增加9％，而产量则下降5％。近几年美国生产力的增加较快，也是造成企业投资巨额增加的一个主要原因，但是这些增加的生产力并没有充分的市场来支持，一到经济下降的时候就使销路问题更加严重。以美国炼钢业为例，在最近五年内生产力增加了23％，目前全年生产力为一亿三千三百五十万吨，但各年全年消费量从来没有超过一亿一千七百万吨，1957年12月中旬的开工率仅为69％左右。以美国汽车业为例，照它目前的生产力每周开工六天、全年开工五十二周计算，全年可以生产大小汽车一千一百万辆，现在开工率仅为三分之二左右。此外，美国许多重要工业都呈现开工不足现象，例如根据今年下半年不同时期的估计：石油业开工率86％，炼铝80％，炼铜76％，人造橡胶77％，人造纤维78％。水泥业尤其是一个突出的例子，它在1955—1956年曾经有过美好的时光，开工率达到99％；但是好景不常，在1957年，一方面由于生产力过分提高，一方面由于生产量绝对数字也有下跌，开工率剧烈下降到82％。
    1957年12月欧洲经济合作组织关于截至1957年中的十八个月美国和加拿大经济的调查报告中已经指出：“在去年，美国经济在许多部门已经正在走向生产力的较低利用，如果没有可能由货币或预算当局采取的行动，难以看出任何足以在未来的几个月中促成重新进行扩充的主要力量”。美国著名经济学者伯恩斯也着重指出，美国的几乎所有主要工业部门的生产力的大量“过剩”是预示生产减缩将要更加严重和更加长久的重要因素之一。生产力过剩同生产过剩是分不开的，美国经济还要继续下降，看来是明显的。

    美国统治集团在1957年并不是没有作出努力来维持经济不使它下降。这一年美国金融当局的通货政策就是一个最好的说明。为了防止通货继续膨胀，美国当局在1957年曾经坚持适当紧缩通货的政策，再次提高贴现率，在编制和执行1957—1958年预算时企图压缩军事开支，争取预算能有盈余。但是，努力的结果却是银根紧张，企业停止扩充，商品销路呆滞，生产开始下跌。因此贴现率提高不久，不得不又降低，军事订货又开始增加，主张平衡预算、减税、增加正常经济活动来稳定经济的财政部长汉弗莱和国防部长威尔逊先后辞职。苏联人造卫星发射以后，扩军备战的声浪压倒了试图走资本主义的正常“和平”经济道路的主张。看来，美国统治集团仍然企图从扩军备战来找寻出路。但是，事实很明显，这条路已经走了好几年，1957年所出现的下降和正在到来的衰退，正是扩军备战所带来的后果。况且，第二次世界大战以后，由于美国战时购买力的积储和西欧经济的恢复，曾经帮助了当时美国经济的上升和减缓了某些时期的下降。现在，情况不同了：1957年欧洲大多数资本主义国家也普遍出现了经济下降，资本主义世界大多数国家都缺少美元，生产下降，对外贸易萎缩，这些国家不但不能帮助美国度过难关，而且都感到自身难保，深怕被美国牵累。显然，用大炮代替牛油的办法丝毫也不能解决美国当前的严重的经济问题。
