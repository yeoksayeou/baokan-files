    Does the Tin Foil Industry Need to Develop?
    Since liberation, the tin foil handicraft industry in Suzhou has developed quite rapidly. The Suzhou Tin Foil Production Cooperative had 2,554 production workers in 1956, and by the end of September 1957, it had grown to 2,925 workers. This cooperative produced 88,664 and a half pieces of tin foil (3,000 sheets per piece) in 1956, 93,723 and a half pieces in 1957, and plans to produce 102,000 pieces in 1958.
    Is the tin foil industry an industry that should develop production, or an industry that should be maintained and transformed? If it is to be maintained and transformed, why is the tin foil industry in Suzhou still developing? In my opinion, the tin foil industry belongs to the superstitious goods industry and does not need to be developed. Why does Suzhou want to develop it? I think it is related to the fact that the relevant management departments regard the tin foil industry as simply a "matter of arranging employment and providing food." They even argued loudly with the raw material supply departments, demanding a solution to the tin foil raw material problem, without seeing that the tin foil industry will eventually be eliminated. If we ignore it now, or even encourage it to develop blindly, it will bring greater and greater difficulties to the transformation work. We should not ignore the fact that the raw material for tin foil is tin metal, which is very much needed for national industrial construction. This one cooperative alone consumes more than 300,000 catties of tin every year. Therefore, I appeal to the relevant management departments in Suzhou: please take timely measures to appropriately and reasonably change this situation, and do not continue to burn important raw materials urgently needed for national economic construction into ashes without any meaning. 　Sun Jimin

### 锡箔业需要发展吗？

    锡箔业需要发展吗？
    苏州市生产锡箔的手工业，解放后发展得相当快。苏州市锡箔生产社1956年有二千五百五十四个生产工人，到1957年9月底发展到二千九百二十五人。这个社1956年生产八万八千六百六十四块半（每块三千张）锡箔，1957年生产九万三千七百二十三块半，1958年计划生产十万零二千块。
    锡箔业究竟是发展生产的行业，还是维持改造的行业？如果是维持改造，为什么苏州市的锡箔业还在继续发展呢？照我看，锡箔业是属于迷信品的行业，是不需要发展的。为什么苏州市要发展它呢？我看是与有关管理部门把锡箔业也看成是单纯的“安排就业的吃饭问题”有关系。他们甚至向原料供应部门大吵大叫要求解决锡箔原料问题，而没有看到锡箔业终究是要被淘汰的。如果现在不管，甚至怂恿它盲目发展下去，会给改造工作带来越来越大的困难。我们更不应忽视：锡箔的原料是国家工业建设非常需要的锡金属。只这一个社每年就要耗去三十多万斤锡。因此，我向苏州市有关管理部门大声疾呼：请及时采取措施，适当而合理地改变这个状况，不要再把国家经济建设急需的重要原料毫无意义地用一把火烧成灰。　孙季民
