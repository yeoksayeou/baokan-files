Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 26th: Dr. Felix-Roland Moumié, head of the Cameroonian delegation, in his report on colonialism to the first plenary session of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference this afternoon, called upon the conference, while reaffirming the Bandung Conference resolutions, to firmly condemn colonialism as a crime against humanity.

Dr. Moumié is the President of the Cameroonian People's Union. In his report, he also stated that colonialism is certainly "the action of adventurers, pirates, big food merchants and arms dealers, gold diggers, and wealthy profiteers."

He cited a large number of facts to attack colonialism. He said that colonialism is a face of imperialism that manifests itself in political, cultural, religious, and social aspects.

He said that today more than two hundred million people are still under colonial rule, such as in Cyprus, Kenya, Algeria, and Cameroon. When the people of these countries try to fight for independence, the colonialists not only carry out brutal "sweeps" and "pacifications," but also use various coercive and seductive methods to prevent the colonial people from realizing their legitimate desire for independence.

This leader cited many examples to illustrate imperialism's economic exploitation of the colonies. He said that in Algeria, six thousand French landlords occupy more than two million hectares of land, an average of more than five hundred hectares per person, while the majority of people have no land at all. In Cameroon, the price of one kilowatt of electricity supplied by a French company is twenty times more expensive than electricity in France itself.

In the cultural sphere, Dr. Moumié pointed out that colonialists have always tried to eliminate local languages, as in Algeria.

Dr. Moumié also reviewed the development of national liberation movements in colonial territories since the Bandung Conference. He said that the people in every part of the African "jungle" have stood up.

He called on the governments of Asian and African countries to provide full support to the national liberation movements in all colonies.

He also called for widespread publicity of the anti-colonial struggles in Asia and Africa in order to mobilize international public opinion. He said that all of this would help to completely eliminate colonialism.

    喀麦隆代表揭露殖民主义残暴丑恶面目
    要求动员一切力量消灭殖民主义
    新华社开罗26日电　喀麦隆代表团团长费利克斯·罗兰·穆米博士今天下午在亚非团结大会第一次全体会议上所作的关于殖民主义问题的报告中，要求大会在重申万隆会议决议的同时，坚决谴责殖民主义是反人道的罪行。
    穆米博士是喀麦隆人民联盟主席。他在报告中还说，殖民主义肯定是“冒险家、海盗、大食品贩子和军火商、淘金者和大腹贾的行动”。
    他列举了大量的事实抨击殖民主义。他说，殖民主义是在政治、文化、宗教和社会各方面都有表现的帝国主义的一种面貌。
    他说，今天有两亿多人民仍然处于殖民主义统治之下。例如塞浦路斯、怯尼亚、阿尔及利亚和喀麦隆。当这些国家的人民设法争取独立的时候，殖民主义者不仅进行残暴的“扫荡”和“绥靖”，而且还以种种威逼利诱的手段阻止殖民地人民实现他们争取独立的正当愿望。
    这位领袖列举了许多例子来说明帝国主义对殖民地的经济剥削。他说，在阿尔及利亚，六千个法国地主占有二百多万公顷土地，平均每人占有五百多公顷，而大多数人没有一点土地。在喀麦隆，有一个法国公司供给的一瓩电力的价格，比法国本国的电力贵二十倍。
    在文化方面，穆米博士指出，殖民主义者一向像在阿尔及利亚那样，试图消灭本地语文。
    穆米博士还回顾了万隆会议以后殖民地民族解放运动发展的情况。他说，非洲“丛林”的各地的人民都站起来了。
    他要求亚非国家的政府对一切殖民地的民族解放运动予以全面的支援。
    他还要求广泛宣传亚非反殖民主义的斗争情况，以便动员国际舆论。他说，这一切有助于完全消灭殖民主义。
