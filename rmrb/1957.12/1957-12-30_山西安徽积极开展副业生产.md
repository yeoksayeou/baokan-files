Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th: Winter sideline production in Shanxi Province's rural areas, which was once in a state of laissez-faire, has become increasingly active.

Agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas such as Taihang, Taiyue, and Lüliang are organizing activities such as digging for medicinal herbs, hunting wild animals, collecting mountain products, and engaging in transportation in the mountains and fields. Many agricultural cooperatives have also opened brick, tile, and lime kilns, as well as workshops for processing tofu, vermicelli, and oil extraction. Many members' household sideline occupations have also been developed, such as weaving willow and vitex products, and raising chickens, ducks, rabbits, and pigs. In the pig category alone, more than 400,000 heads have been added since the beginning of winter. According to statistics from the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agricultural Construction, in the past month alone, various sideline production activities in the four regions of Southern Shanxi, Changzhi, Yanbei, and Xinzhou can generate more than 14.2 million yuan in income.

Since the beginning of winter, agricultural leading departments in various regions and many agricultural cooperatives have neglected to lead and develop sideline production in a planned way when arranging and leading winter production, resulting in about two-thirds of the province's agricultural cooperatives being in a state of laissez-faire or semi-laissez-faire in winter sideline production. In some areas, there has also been an outflow of farmers, the trafficking of draught animals and state-controlled materials, as well as commercial activities such as opening hotels and restaurants. Yanbei, Xinzhou and other regions have recently summarized the previous stage of winter production work, specifically studied this situation and problems, and made comprehensive arrangements. They also helped agricultural cooperatives formulate plans for sideline production this winter and next spring. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have also sent cadres deep into agricultural cooperatives to conduct investigations and research, and help agricultural cooperatives solve the various tools needed to carry out sideline production.

According to the Shanxi Provincial agricultural leading departments, sideline production income alone is expected to reach more than 100 million yuan this winter and next spring.

Xinhua News Agency: Since Anhui Province convened a provincial sideline production conference in early November to study and deploy winter sideline production, Party and government organs in various regions have held meetings to implement the spirit of this conference. In order to help agricultural cooperatives expand sideline production avenues, Zhide County also held various economic exhibitions, and organized 5,000 grassroots cadres to visit the exhibitions. In addition to holding a county-wide pig raising experience exchange meeting, Taihu County also held a meeting of fishermen and hunters representatives to mobilize fishermen and hunters throughout the county to carry out fishing and hunting activities.

This year, thanks to attention to the development of sideline production, Anhui Province achieved a total sideline production income of more than 440 million yuan in the first ten months, an increase of nearly one and a half times compared to the total sideline production income for the whole of last year.

    山西安徽积极开展副业生产
    新华社太原27日电　山西省农村中一度处于自流状态的冬季副业生产，已经日趋活跃。
    太行、太岳、吕梁等山区的农业社，正在山野里有组织地进行刨药材、打野兽、采集山货和搞运输等副业生产。许多农业社还开办了砖、瓦、石灰窑和豆腐、粉条、榨油等加工作坊。许多社员的家庭副业也开展起来。例如编制柳条和荆条的制品，喂养鸡、鸭、兔、猪等，仅猪一项，入冬以后就增加了四十多万头。据山西省农业建设厅统计，近一个月来，仅晋南、长治、雁北和忻县等四个地区，各种副业生产即可收入一千四百二十多万元。
    入冬以来，各地农业领导部门和许多农业社在安排和领导冬季生产中，忽视了有计划地领导开展副业生产，致使全省约三分之二的农业社冬季副业生产处于自流和半自流状态。部分地区还出现了农民外流、贩运耕畜和国家统购物资的现象，以及开旅店、开饭店等商业活动。雁北、忻县等地区在最近总结前段冬季生产工作中，专门研究了这方面的情况和问题，进行了全面安排。并帮助农业社制订今冬明春副业生产的计划。各地供销合作社也纷纷派干部深入农业社，进行调查研究，帮助农业社解决开展副业生产所需的各种工具。
    据山西省农业领导部门谈，今冬明春仅副业生产收入，预计可达一亿元以上。
    据新华社讯　安徽省自从在11月上旬召开全省副业生产会议研究与布置冬季副业生产以来，各地党政机关都开会贯彻了这个会议的精神。为了帮助农业社扩大副业生产门路，至德县还举办了多种经济展览会，组织了五千多基层干部参观展览会。太湖县除召开了全县养猪经验交流会外，还召开了渔民、猎手代表会，发动全县渔民、猎手开展捕鱼、打猎活动。
    今年，安徽省由于注意开展副业生产，在头十个月内副业生产的总收益达四亿四千多万元，比去年全年的副业生产的收益增加将近一倍半。
