    Building a Highway on the Pamir Plateau
    The first highway traversing the Pamir Plateau – the Kashgar-Taxkorgan Highway – is under intense construction. Currently, the highway has been built to Kurlik, 109 kilometers from Kashgar. This highway leads to the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County, and the project is extremely arduous. Over two-thirds of the approximately 300-kilometer route is built on the Pamir Plateau. The route follows mountains and rivers, the air is thin, and landslides are frequent.

    帕米尔高原修公路
    穿过帕米尔高原的第一条公路——喀（喀什）塔（塔什库尔干）公路，正在紧张修建。目前，这条公路已经修至离喀什一百零九公里的库尔里克。这条公路通往塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县，工程非常艰巨。在全长约三百公里的线路上，有三分之二的地段是建筑在帕米尔高原上。沿线依山傍水，空气稀薄，而且经常坍方。
