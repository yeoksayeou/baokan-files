　　Auspicious Snow Foretells a Good Harvest
　　Jiang Nan

　　This year wheat is covered with three quilts, next year you’ll sleep with a steamed bun for a pillow.
                            ——Folk saying

    A few days ago, the Beijing area had its first snow of the year; in the vast land between Heilongjiang and Songhua River, it was already a scene of ice and snow. People say, "Auspicious snow foretells a good harvest," how much yearning this snow evokes for next year's bumper harvest!

    Snow and rain are "siblings." There is nothing different in the process of their formation. When the atmospheric temperature drops below zero degrees Celsius, the water vapor in the air directly turns into snowflakes, and when the air can't hold them, they fall down and become "goose feather snow."

    Winter snow is always a very precious gift for farmers!

    The fields are covered with a thick layer of snow, just like putting a cotton quilt on the crops. What does this mean? This means that for overwintering crops—wheat—snow plays a role in keeping them warm. Snow is mixed with a lot of air, and air does not conduct heat. In this way, the cold air outside cannot penetrate into the soil, and the heat in the soil is not easily dissipated. Isn't this like putting a cotton quilt on the crops? Scientists have tested that the temperature above and below the snow can sometimes differ by fifteen to twenty degrees. Under these circumstances, the soil is also not easy to freeze. In this way, not only can it protect crops safely through the winter, but it is also conducive to the reproduction of bacteria in the soil, which accelerates the decay of dead leaves and weeds in the soil and turns them into fertilizer for the crops.

    A thick layer of snow on the ground can also store water. This is because, first, the snow cover reduces the evaporation of soil moisture; second, a heavy snowfall in winter is like a natural reservoir, storing a lot of water for the crops. Snow water continuously seeps into the soil, which is very beneficial for spring plowing and sowing, as well as the growth and development of crops. This is especially important in arid areas. Northwest China is an arid area, but the people there use the snow water flowing down from the Qilian Mountains and Tianshan Mountains to irrigate vast areas of cotton fields, grain fields, orchards, and vegetable gardens, and thus appeared "Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall."

    Snow has a warming effect on the soil, which is temporarily beneficial to pests that burrow into the ground. However, when the snow melts, it absorbs a lot of heat from the soil. At this time, the soil will suddenly become very cold, and many pests cannot withstand it and are frozen to death.

    Since snow can protect crops through the winter, store water, and eliminate pests, it is entirely understandable to say "auspicious snow foretells a good harvest."

　　今年麦盖三床被，明年枕着馒头睡。
                            ——农谚
    前几天，北京地区才落了今年的第一场雪；在黑龙江、松花江间的广大土地上早已是一片冰天雪地了。人们说：“瑞雪兆丰年”，这场雪引起人们对明年丰收的多少向往啊！
    雪和雨本是“同胞兄弟”。它们形成的过程没有什么两样。当大气温度降到摄氏零度以下时，空中的水汽就直接变成雪花，等到空气托不住他们，就落下来，成为“鹅毛大雪”。
    冬天的雪，对农民永远是十分珍贵的礼物！
    田野里铺上了厚厚的一层雪，就好像是给庄稼盖上了一层棉被。这是什么意思呢？这是说，对于越冬的庄稼——小麦，雪起了保暖的作用。雪里夹杂着很多空气，空气是不传热的，这样一来，外面的冷空气钻不到土壤里去，土壤里的热又不容易散出来，这不像是给庄稼盖上了棉被一样吗？科学家试验过，雪上雪下，温度有时竟相差十五度到二十度。在这种情况下，土壤也不容易结冻。这样，不仅可以保护庄稼安全过冬，而且有利于土壤里的细菌繁殖，使土壤里的枯叶、杂草加快腐烂，成为庄稼的肥料。
    地面上盖上了厚厚的一层雪，还可以储蓄水分。这是因为，第一，由于雪的覆盖，减少了土壤水分的蒸发；第二，冬天下了大雪，就好像一座天然水库，给庄稼蓄存了很多水。雪水不断渗入土壤里，对春耕播种以及庄稼的生长发育都是很有好处的。在干旱地区，尤为重要。我国西北，本是干旱地区，但那里的人民利用了祁连山、天山流下来的雪水，灌溉了万顷棉田、粮地、果园、菜圃，因而才出现了“塞外江南”。
    雪对于土壤起了保温的作用，这对钻到地下的害虫是一时有利的。但化雪的时候，要从土壤里吸收许多热量，这时，土壤会突然变得非常寒冷，许多害虫，经受不住，便被冻死。
    既然雪可以保护庄稼过冬、储蓄水分、消灭害虫，说“瑞雪兆丰年”，也就完全可以理解了。
