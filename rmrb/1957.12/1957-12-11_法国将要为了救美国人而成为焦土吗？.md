　　Will France Become Scorched Earth to Save the Americans?
　　Laviergne, Professor of Law, University of Paris

    Editor's Note: This article is excerpted from the November 29th issue of the Paris weekly "International Forum." It quite typically reflects the views of the broad public in France—that is, Western Europe—on the current international situation (especially on the American plan to establish missile bases in various Western European countries).

    "If a person in my position did not have a devout religious belief, did not firmly believe in the existence of God whom we all absolutely trust, then he would abandon the White House and prefer to go to St. Elizabeth's Hospital (note: this is an asylum)." This is what President Eisenhower said on American television on November 8th. We can hardly believe that such words were spoken, yet it is true. This passage aptly expresses the panic currently felt among American officials. These rulers are indeed terrified, because they now know that if war breaks out, their cities and industrial centers, all concentrated in a small corner of northeastern America, can easily be destroyed by Russian thermonuclear missiles with a range of 8,000 kilometers. They also know that their ports will be blockaded by numerous Russian submarines equipped with ballistic missiles, so that when they reach 200 to 300 kilometers from the American coast, they can also use their rockets to bombard American cities.

    If the American rulers were still clear-headed, they would have concluded that they must, as soon as possible, conclude a universally supervised disarmament agreement with Moscow, as the Kremlin had long suggested. If this agreement were concluded, any threat of war could have been avoided, because it is absolutely true that Moscow has no intention of resorting to force. Why would it do so? In peacetime, the Soviet Union can bring all Asian countries, even the Near East, under its own influence without cost or danger.

    The Russian authorities reject the American-proposed aerial inspection of nuclear missile factories and military bases. Such inspections are almost completely meaningless. Photos taken by American planes in Russia and photos taken by Russian planes in America will cause endless and fruitless disputes. How can one judge from these aerial photos whether a large factory is manufacturing shoes, machine tools, or nuclear missiles? The appearance of modern large factories is very similar to each other. The Russian government announced that it would accept inspections of its military factories and bases by sending delegations of officers and experts, as long as such inspections could also be carried out in the United States. Why don't the American rulers believe this Russian suggestion, why don't they accept this dual inspection? Not long ago, the Americans still believed that they were ahead of their hypothetical enemy. But now they, and the whole world, have discovered that the Russians are far ahead, because the United States still barely knows how to manufacture rockets with a range of 2,400 kilometers, while the Russian rockets with a range of 8,000 kilometers can cross the Arctic and destroy American cities.

    The speed of a rocket is at least 7,000 to 10,000 kilometers per hour. There is no way to protect cities from the attack of such terrible weapons. Therefore, it is absurd to think that any country can obtain security by relying on armaments in the future (no matter how excellent the armaments). Mankind has evolved to the point where any nation, no matter how powerful, can only obtain security by relying on a universally supervised disarmament agreement.

    Therefore, if the American rulers have any sense, they will resume negotiations with Moscow on disarmament without delay.

    Eisenhower does not have the strength to resist the pressure of the Pentagon officers, who, like all soldiers, regard super-expansion of armaments as a savior. He also cannot withstand the equally powerful pressure exerted by the American industries that manufacture armaments—which would lose a lot of money if they were converted to peaceful industries. Dulles recently said triumphantly: "The United States has the initiative in the Cold War." Of course, one can be proud as long as one can! But, without a doubt, it would be much more glorious for the United States to have the initiative in atomic research!

    Now that the United States is in the tragic situation we all know, how does it intend to deal with Russia's undeniable advantage? Eisenhower said last week with a frankness that leaves one speechless: "This need makes it very clear to us that our allies are very important. They not only strengthen our common security with military participation, but also provide us with bases and deployment areas for our own troops."

    Readers of course understand the implication! Western European countries must become American aircraft carriers, so that the United States can establish American missile launchers with short ranges within our countries. In this way, the United States, which is unable to bomb the Soviet Union from bases in the Americas, will be able to do so due to our obsequious cooperation. Moreover, according to the Anglo-American plan formulated by the American president and the British prime minister last month, the United States and Britain will specialize in manufacturing nuclear missiles, while France and Germany, the two second-rate military powers, will specialize in providing aircraft and infantry—in short, providing cannon fodder!

    A rocket fired from western Russia can reach Paris or London in less than a quarter of an hour, and can hit any city in Germany in less than ten minutes.

    Simply put, the truth is as follows: General Norstad refused to defend Europe with horrifying coldness precisely because he first understood that it was absolutely impossible to prevent the Russians from destroying the residents of France and Germany; in fact, only one hydrogen bomb would be enough to poison all the residents of Paris and its surrounding areas to death. In an instant, Western Europe will become scorched earth. The residents of France, Germany, and Britain will be wiped off the face of the earth within two or three weeks after the outbreak of war. This is what the Americans and our obsequious, pathetic ministers call defending Europe!

    We want to point out that, in particular, the Americans will retain the exclusive right to "press the button," and only they will be able to launch the bombs and rockets on bases in France. Our government will not need to say anything, and our country will be plunged into war—a terrible war. We can only call those who give up all power in this regard—our rulers—ministers. However, is it not rather that they are slaves who have almost replaced the blacks previously oppressed by the Americans? If we agree to place American rockets in France, this is a shameful trampling on our national sovereignty. France, Britain, and Germany will be reduced to the ranks of Puerto Rico and the Philippines, the unquestioning vassal states of the United States. When people are foolishly alarmed by Russian intentions, they will inevitably do such shameful things. In return for our submissive attitude, the Americans, with the help of the British, are even providing weapons to Tunisia, and recently even to Morocco. Indeed, the French people should not be subjected to so much humiliation.

    The United States now has 120 strategic bases outside its territory, including 10 in France, 18 in Britain, and 25 in Germany. The United States also plans to add 48 more around the world. Adenauer or Macmillan have every right to decide whether to let the German people and the British people suffer atomic destruction in their entirety within a few weeks once war breaks out. However, we French people do not find this prospect pleasing, and we want to announce that the American plan is purely a criminal act against us. France must withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as soon as possible. This organization is no longer a guarantee, but a deadly threat to us.

    Fortunately, the United States will not be able to set up its death rockets in this occupied territory of Europe until 1959 or 1960.

    Our country's policy has already agreed in principle to set up rockets in France that are only controlled by the Americans. This policy is so stupid that if this death plan is implemented, all the French people will only be able to live by relying on the peaceful intentions of the Soviet Union, which, despite its undeniable advantage, remains peace-loving.

    There are still eighteen months before American rockets may arrive in our country. We, the French people, are filled with anger. We must tell the Americans and our own rulers: We refuse to suffer atomic destruction one day in order to please the Americans!

### 法国将要为了救美国人而成为焦土吗？

专栏：外论摘要

　　法国将要为了救美国人而成为焦土吗？
　　法国巴黎大学法学院教授  拉维尔涅
    编者按：这篇文章摘译自11月29日巴黎“国际论坛”周刊，它相当典型地反映了法国——也就是西欧广大社会公众对目前国际局势（特别是对美国计划在西欧各国建立导弹基地）的看法。
    “如果一个处在我这种地位的人不具有虔诚的宗教信念，不是坚信我们大家所绝对信赖的上帝的存在，那末，他便会放弃白宫，而宁愿进圣伊丽莎白医院（按这是一个疯人院）了”。这就是艾森豪威尔总统11月8日在美国电视中所说的话。我们简直不能相信会说这样的话，然而确有其事。这段话恰如其分地表达出目前美国官方人士中间的恐慌情绪。这些统治者确实是惊惶万状，因为他们现在知道：如果战争爆发，他们那些统统集中在美国东北一小角地方的城市和工业中心，很容易就会被射程达八千公里的俄国热核导弹摧毁。他们也知道：他们的港口将被许许多多俄国潜水艇封锁，这些潜水艇装备着弹道导弹，以至于当它们到达距离美国海岸两三百公里的时候，也可以用它们的火箭来轰击美国各城市。
    假如美国统治者头脑还清醒，他们本会因而得出结论：必须尽速按照克里姆林宫早已提出的建议，同莫斯科缔结有监督的普遍裁军协定。如果缔结这个协定，任何战争威胁本可以已经避免，因为千真万确的是莫斯科丝毫也不想动武。它为什么要这样做呢？苏联在和平时期可以不付代价和毫无危险地把亚洲一切国家、甚至把近东置于它自己的势力之下。
    俄国当局拒绝美国所建议的从空中视察核导弹工厂和军事基地。这种视察几乎是完全没有意义的。美国飞机在俄国拍摄的照片和俄国飞机在美国拍摄的照片，将引起无止无休的没有结果的争论。怎能依据这种空中摄下的照片来判断一座大工厂是制造皮鞋的，还是制造工作母机的，还是制造核导弹的呢？现代大工厂的外貌是彼此非常相像的。俄国政府宣布接受用派遣军官和专家代表团的办法视察它的军事工厂和基地，只要也能对美国进行这种视察。美国统治者为什么不相信俄国人的这种建议，为什么不接受这种双重视察呢？前此不久，美国人还相信自己比他们的假想敌人走在前面。而现在他们以及全世界都发现俄国人走在前面很远了，因为美国还几乎不懂得怎样制造射程二千四百公里的火箭，而俄国的射程达八千公里的火箭却可以越过北极而摧毁美国的城市了。
    火箭的速度至少是每小时七千至一万公里。没有任何办法可以保护城市不受这种恐怖武器的攻击。因此，如果以为今后会有哪一个国家能依靠军备来获得安全（无论是多么优良的军备），这就是荒谬透顶的想法。人类已进化到这种地步：任何民族，无论多么强大，都只有依靠有监督的普遍裁军协定来获得安全。
    因此，假如美国统治者还有一点常识，他们就会毫不延迟地同莫斯科恢复关于裁军的谈判。
    艾森豪威尔没有力量抗拒五角大楼军官的压力，这些军官像所有的军人一样把超级扩充军备看作救星。他也抵挡不住制造军火的美国工业所施加的同样有力的压力——如果改为和平工业，这些工业就会损失许多金钱。杜勒斯前不久得意洋洋地说：“美国在冷战中掌握着主动。”当然，只要是能够，尽可以得意！但是，毫无疑问，对美国说来，如果在原子研究中掌握主动，那会光荣得多！
    美国既然处在大家所知道的悲惨地位，那么它打算怎样对付俄国的不容争议的优势呢？艾森豪威尔上周用一种使人无话可说的坦率态度说道：“这种需要使我们看得很清楚：我们的各盟国是十分重要的。它们不仅用军事参与来加强我们的共同安全，而且使我们获得供我们自己军队使用的基地和部署地区”。
    读者当然明白其含义！西欧各国必须成为美国的航空母舰，以便让美国在我们国家境内建立射程不大的美国导弹发射台。这样一来，无力从美洲境内基地轰炸苏联的美国，便将由于我们的卑躬屈节的合作而做到这种轰炸。此外，根据美国总统和英国首相上月拟订的英美计划，美国和英国将专门制造核导弹，而法国和德国这两个次等军事强国，则将专门提供飞机和步兵——简言之，提供炮灰！
    从俄国西部射出一枚火箭，不要一刻钟就可以打到巴黎或伦敦，不到十分钟就击中德国的任何城市。
    简单说来，真相如下：诺斯塔德将军以令人骇异的冷酷态度拒绝防卫欧洲，正是因为他首先了解了绝对阻止不住俄国人毁灭法德两国的居民；事实上，只需一枚氢弹就足以使巴黎及其附近地区的全部居民中毒而死。瞬息之间，西欧将成为焦土。法国、德国、英国的居民在战争爆发后两三个星期以内，就会从地面上消灭，这就是美国人以及我们的唯唯诺诺的可怜虫部长们所谓的防御欧洲！
    我们要指出：尤其是，美国人将保留着只有他们才能“按电钮”的独占权，简单说来，只有他们才能使在法国基地上的炸弹和火箭起飞。将不需要我国政府说任何话，我国就被投入了战争——极可怕的战争，我们尽可以把那些在这一方面放弃一切权力的人——我们的统治者称为部长。然而，难道不是毋宁说他们是几乎代替了美国人以往所压迫的黑人的位置的奴隶吗？假如我们同意在法国安置美国火箭，这就是可耻地践踏我们的国家主权。法国、英国和德国将降低到美国的不折不扣的附庸国波多黎各和菲律宾之列。当人们愚蠢地对俄国意图感到惶恐的时候，就必然会做出这种可耻的行为。为了答谢我们那样卑顺的态度，美国人在英国人帮助之下，竟然提供武器给突尼斯，而且最近还要提供给摩洛哥。确实，法国人民不应该受到这么多的侮辱。
    美国现在在国土之外有一百二十个战略基地，其中十个在法国、十八个在英国、二十五个在德国。美国还打算在全世界增设四十八个。阿登纳或麦克米伦完全有权决定，一旦战争爆发，是否让德国人民和英国人民在几个星期之内全部遭受原子毁灭。然而，我们法国人并不觉得这种前途是令人高兴的，我们要宣布，美国的计划纯粹是对我们的犯罪行为。法国必须退出北大西洋公约组织，越早越好，这个组织已经不是保障，而是对我们的致命威胁。
    幸好，美国要到1959年或1960年才有能力在欧洲这个被占领地方设置它的死亡火箭。
    我国政策已经原则上同意在法国设置仅受美国人控制的火箭，这种政策极其愚蠢，以至于这种死亡计划如果执行，法国全体人民都只有依靠苏联的和平意愿才能活命，苏联尽管占有不容争议的优势，却仍然是爱好和平的。
    还有十八个月，美国火箭就可能运抵我国国土了，我们法国人民满腔愤怒，我们必须告诉美国人和我们自己的统治者：我们拒绝为了使美国人开心而在某一天遭受原子毁灭！
