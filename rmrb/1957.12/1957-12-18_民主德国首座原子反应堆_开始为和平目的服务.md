Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 17th. East Germany's first atomic reactor, located near Dresden, began operating on the morning of the 16th. Chairman of the People's Chamber Dieckmann, Prime Minister Grotewohl, Deputy Prime Minister Selbmann, and others attended the opening ceremony of the atomic reactor.

Speaking on behalf of the government, Selbmann said: He hoped that the commissioning of this reactor would meet the wishes of peace-loving people in West Germany and that all of Germany's atomic energy would only serve peaceful purposes. He sincerely thanked the Soviet government for its assistance in building this reactor and other facilities. He said: "Because the much smaller reactor being built in Munich, West Germany, has not yet been completed, and the ancillary equipment and research institute buildings are not yet usable, this reactor is also the first reactor in all of Germany."

Selbmann also announced that an East German cyclotron will begin operating in a few months. In addition, a radiochemical research institute is under construction.

    民主德国首座原子反应堆
    开始为和平目的服务
    据新华社柏林17日电　设在德累斯顿附近的民主德国第一个原子反应堆已在16日上午开始工作。人民议院议长狄克曼、总理格罗提渥、副总理赛尔布曼等参加了原子反应堆的开幕典礼。
    赛尔布曼代表政府讲话说：他希望这个反应堆的开工将符合西德爱好和平人士的愿望，使全德国的原子能只为和平目的服务。他诚挚地感谢苏联政府对建造这个反应堆和其他设备所给予的援助。他说：“由于在西德慕尼黑建造的小得多的反应堆还没有建成，附属设备和研究所的房屋还不能使用，因此这个反应堆也是全德国的第一个反应堆。”
    赛尔布曼还宣布：民主德国的一个回旋加速器将在几个月以后开始工作。此外还有一个放射性化学研究所在建造中。
