Xinhua News Agency, December 4th, Rabat (Morocco) Dispatch: The Ifni uprising residents have achieved rich victories in the battles against the Spanish colonial army over the past two days. Armed conflicts are continuing in most parts of Ifni.

According to the Moroccan Istiqlal Party newspaper "Al-Alam," the Ifni uprising people are narrowing the encirclement of the Spanish stronghold of Tiliouine in southeastern Ifni; the resistance of the besieged Spanish troops is rapidly weakening. The insurgents have begun using captured artillery to strike at the Spanish colonial army.

The newspaper also said that Souk El Arbaa, fourteen miles southeast of Sidi Ifni, is also under siege by the uprising people. Almost all of the Spanish paratroopers airdropped into this area to reinforce the area were captured alive by the Ifni insurgents. In addition, the Spanish troops sent by road to reinforce the Sebha-Si Bouya post nine miles north of Tiliouine were also repelled by the uprising people.

At the same time, the Spanish colonial army is still trying to suppress the armed uprising of the Ifni people. They indiscriminately bombed Ifni settlements with aircraft and shelled the area between Sidi Ifni and the Atlantic coast with warships. However, snipers from the Ifni uprising army successfully prevented Spanish reinforcements from landing in the Atlantic coastal area.

Reports say that Spain is constantly sending reinforcements to Ifni and other parts of Spanish West Africa, including Rio de Oro.

　　伊夫尼起义人民战果辉煌
  　西班牙殖民者仍在增兵力图镇压
    新华社4日讯　拉巴特（摩洛哥）消息：伊夫尼起义居民两天来在反抗西班牙殖民军的战斗中取得了丰富的战果。伊夫尼境内大部分地区的武装冲突仍在继续进行中。
    据摩洛哥独立党机关报“旗帜报”报道，伊夫尼起义人民正在缩小对伊夫尼东南部提利奎因的西班牙据点的包围圈；西班牙被围部队的抵抗正在迅速减弱。起义军开始用缴获的大炮来打击西班牙殖民军。
    报纸还说，西迪伊夫尼东南十四英里的苏勒阿西姆也在起义人民的包围中。空降到这个地区来增援的西班牙伞兵几乎全部被伊夫尼起义者生擒。另外，西班牙由公路派去增援提利奎因以北九英里的斯布西据点的部队也被起义人民击退。
    在这同时，西班牙殖民军仍旧力图把伊夫尼人民的武装起义镇压下去。它们用飞机滥炸伊夫尼居民点并且用军舰炮轰西迪伊夫尼到大西洋岸之间的地区。但是，伊夫尼起义军的狙击兵成功地阻止了西班牙援兵在大西洋沿岸地区登陆。
    有消息说，西班牙还在不断增派援兵到伊夫尼以及包括里约特俄罗在内的西属西非洲各地。
