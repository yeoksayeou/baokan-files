Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 1st: Shanghai's universities and colleges have strengthened the Party's leadership over teaching work during the rectification campaign, creating conditions for vigorously improving teaching quality and cultivating intellectuals of the working class.

In fifteen universities and colleges, 350 cadres have been transferred from the school's Party and administrative leadership departments to serve as Party branch secretaries, department heads, and assistant department heads, including 25 cadres at the division chief level. This has changed the situation in which the Party and administrative leadership structures of various schools were bloated while the teaching units—the departments—were weak, especially the Party's leadership within the departments.

After these cadres were transferred to the departments, they began to actively familiarize themselves with the situation, delve into professional work, and work with teachers to study and solve problems existing in teaching. Second-year students in the Marine Fisheries Department of Shanghai Fisheries College repeatedly raised the issue of excessive study burden, but it had not been resolved. The cadre transferred to this department assisted the department head in conducting in-depth investigations and research into the study situation of each class in the second grade, and found that the students' burden was indeed too heavy. Most students often burned the midnight oil, and the academic performance or health level of outstanding students was also declining. The main reason for this situation was unreasonable scheduling. Now, the Marine Fisheries Department has reorganized the curriculum for the second grade, increased students' self-study time, and strengthened tutoring. The problem of excessive study burden has been basically solved.

In order to make political work oriented to teaching and better play the Party's leading role in teaching, many Party member cadres are using their utmost perseverance to delve into professional knowledge and transform themselves from outsiders to insiders. Liu Xiuqing, deputy secretary of the Party branch of the Law Department of Fudan University, was transferred to the first grade of the Law Department to serve as the student branch secretary. While doing student political work, she studied with the first-grade students. She plans to reach the university graduation level within five years while exploring a set of student political work experiences. Shanghai First Medical College has formulated a plan to set up study classes to organize Party and government cadres to systematically learn professional knowledge, requiring cadres with a junior high school education or above who do not understand professional work to use eight hours of their spare time each week within two and a half years to study thirteen subjects such as biochemistry, anatomy, physiology, pathology, and pharmacology, so as to have general medical knowledge. Wang Lesan, vice president of the First Medical College and third secretary of the Party committee, and other responsible cadres are also preparing to participate in this study.

The Party committees of many universities have organized a group of teachers with teaching experience and a certain academic level to serve as assistants to the Party committee in studying teaching and scientific issues. More than 20 Party member cadres including Party committee members, ministers of Party committee departments, branch secretaries, and division chiefs of Jiaotong University have begun to contact more than 20 major teaching and research groups in a division of labor. Fudan University also transferred 22 Party member lecturers, teaching assistants, and a group of full-time political work cadres to serve as student branch secretaries, reducing the workload of student cadres and exploring the experience of combining political work and teaching work.

During the rectification, many universities have put forward the slogan that teachers should be fully responsible for students. Fudan University first transferred 162 outstanding teachers to serve as study guidance teachers for all classes in the school, responsible for guiding students in all aspects of study, thought, and life, and establishing friendships with students. In just two weeks, they have learned about many problems and ideological situations that students had in their studies that they rarely understood in the past. The Fisheries College has also set up counselors in each class.

### 提高教学质量　培养工人阶级知识分子　上海高等学校加强党对教学工作的领导

　　提高教学质量　培养工人阶级知识分子
　　上海高等学校加强党对教学工作的领导
    新华社上海1日电　上海各高等学校在整改过程中加强了党对教学工作的领导，为大力提高教学质量和培养工人阶级知识分子创造了条件。
    在十五所高等学校里，已有三百五十名干部由学校党政领导部门调任系总支书记、系主任、系主任助理等工作，其中二十五人是处长一级干部。这就使得各校党政领导机构庞肿而教学单位——系力量薄弱，特别是系内党的领导薄弱的现象有了改变。
    这批干部调到系里后，已开始积极熟悉情况，钻研业务，同教师一道研究解决教学工作中存在的问题。上海水产学院海洋渔业系二年级学生曾经一再提出学习负担过重的问题，但一直没有得到解决。调到这个系的干部协助系主任深入调查研究了二年级各班的学习情况，发现学生负担的确太重，大部分学生经常开夜车，优等生的学习成绩或健康水平也在下降，而造成这一情况的主要原因是排课不合理。现在海洋渔业系已重新安排了二年级的课程，增加学生自学时间，并加强辅导，学习负担过重的问题已基本解决。
    为了使政治工作面向教学，更好地发挥党对教学工作的领导作用，许多党员干部正在用最大的毅力钻研业务知识，变外行为内行。复旦大学法律系党总支副书记刘秀卿，调到法律系一年级担任学生支部书记后，一面做学生政治工作，一面和一年级学生一道学习，她打算在五年内达到大学毕业的水平，同时摸索出一套学生政治工作经验。上海第一医学院已订出开办学习班，组织党政干部系统学习业务知识的计划，要求初中以上文化程度不懂业务的干部，在二年半内利用每周八小时的业余时间，学习生物化学、解剖、生理、病理、药理等十三门功课，具备一般的医学知识。第一医学院副院长、党委第三书记王乐三等负责干部也准备参加这项学习。
    许多高等学校的党委会都组织了一批有教学经验和一定学术水平的教师，作为党委研究有关教学和科学问题的助手。交通大学的党委委员、党委会各部部长、总支书记、处长等二十多名党员干部，已开始分工深入联系二十多个主要教研组。复旦大学还调配了二十二名党员讲师、助教和一批专职政治工作干部担任了学生支部书记，一面减轻学生干部的工作负担，一面摸索政治工作和教学工作相结合的经验。
    在整改中，许多高等学校都提出了教师对学生全面负责的口号。复旦大学首先抽调了一百六十二名优秀教师担任全校各班的学习指导教师，负责对学生进行学习、思想、生活等各方面的指导工作，和学生建立友谊。在短短的二周内，他们已了解到不少过去很少了解的学生学习中存在的问题和思想情况。水产学院也在各班设立了辅导员。
