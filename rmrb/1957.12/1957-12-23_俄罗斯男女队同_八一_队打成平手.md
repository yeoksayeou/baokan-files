Russian men's and women's basketball teams played friendly matches with the "August 1st" Men's Red Team and the "August 1st" Women's Team at the Beijing Gymnasium last night. The women's team match ended in a 62-62 tie, and the men's team match ended in a 61-61 tie, both ending in a draw.

Vice Chairman Zhu De and Vice Premiers Deng Xiaoping, He Long, Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Nie Rongzhen watched the game last night.

The "August 1st" Women's Team Failed to Win

The women's team match was tense and enthusiastic throughout. The characteristics of the visiting team were: quick ball movement, active running, and strong threat under the basket; the home team was: full of energy, alert and flexible, accurate shooting, and successful penetration. This was a closely matched game.

In the first quarter, Vikshina of the visiting team scored the first point under the basket, followed by Chiriberbaluru who made a free throw. Yegreleva and Babenko also scored from mid-range. The home team was not to be outdone, with Chen Changfeng, Shi Wenyuan, and others constantly scoring under the basket or from mid-range. The score gradually rose from three to zero: three to one; five to two; seven to two; seven to four; eight to nine; eleven to nine; thirteen to fourteen; fifteen to fourteen. The visiting team won the first quarter by a one-point advantage.

In the second quarter, the visiting team took the lead at thirty to twenty-eight.

In the third quarter, the home team became more active after adjusting its lineup. Shi Wenyuan scored under the basket, Chen Changfeng and Peng Shugan and others made multiple penetrations and mid-range shots, and basically controlled the rebounds and kept an eye on Yegreleva of the visiting team. The score greatly exceeded the visiting team, and finally won the third quarter with fifty to thirty-eight. The visiting team was a bit abnormal in the third quarter, and both offense and defense were not good enough. In ten minutes, the home team scored twenty-two points, while the visiting team only scored eight points.

The fourth quarter was the decisive quarter. Both sides changed their tactics. The visiting team changed to full-court man-to-man defense and fast-break offense; the home team played control ball and adopted a steady approach. The visiting team's fast break was ultimately better than the home team's slow play. They continued to score, and the score gradually narrowed. With three minutes left, the score was fifty to fifty-six, and the home team only had a six-point advantage. This advantage was gradually decreasing due to the influence of the "slow play" tactic. Fifty-two to fifty-six; fifty-four to fifty-eight; fifty-six to fifty-eight; fifty-six to sixty; fifty-eight to sixty; fifty-eight to sixty-two. With only forty seconds left, Vikshina of the visiting team scored two consecutive goals from mid-range and under the basket, and finally tied the score at sixty-two to sixty-two.

Originally, the home team had a twelve-point lead, and there was hope of winning as long as they played carefully. However, when switching to control ball, the players did not control the ball well, resulting in the loss of many points. It can be said that the "August 1st" Women's Team should have won last night but failed to.

"August 1st" Red Team Sought a Draw and Achieved It

At the start of the men's team match, both sides adopted fast-break and combination pull-apart penetration, and zone-man defense. Five minutes into the game, Zhou Chunlin and Wu Zibing of the "August 1st" Red Team scored seven consecutive points through free throws and shots. The visiting team's scorers, Zubkov and Kontieri, were tightly marked by Yu Yuanxu and Wu Zibing, and the "sharp shooter" Kraev was also watched closely by Yu Bangji, failing to score a single point. It was not until the sixth minute that Zubkov made two free throws. Afterwards, Kraev of the visiting team made three long-range shots, and Karlin and Kontieri repeatedly scored. By the tenth minute, they had narrowed the gap to sixteen to seventeen, surpassing by one point. The "August 1st" team also scored repeatedly with fast breaks and pull-apart penetration. By the end of the first half, the score was tied at thirty-three. Although the "August 1st" team did not get many rebounds in the first half, Yu Yuanxu and Wu Zibing did a good job of keeping an eye on Zubkov and Kontieri, so they were able to tie the score.

In the second half, the competition became more intense. The score on the field was often a difference of one or two points, with a one-point difference nine times, a two-point difference ten times, and a tie five times. Less than a minute into the second half, Kraev, a skilled shooter for the visiting team, was fouled out for the fifth time, but their offensive momentum did not weaken. In the tenth minute, the visiting team led by one point. With three minutes left, the score on the field was fifty-seven to sixty-one, and the visiting team had exceeded the "August 1st" team by four points. At this time, the "August 1st" team switched to full-court press. With two minutes and fifty seconds left, Zubkov's pass was intercepted by Lu Lianhan, reducing the score to fifty-nine to sixty-one. With one minute and fifty seconds left, the "August 1st" team replaced Yu Bangji again, and Wang Zhaoyu switched to control ball, but they were still losing by one point. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the "August 1st" team immediately changed its tactics and actively sought to shoot. With five seconds left, Lu Lianhan penetrated from the middle and scored, tying the score at sixty-one. This goal saved the "August 1st" team from losing.

The last three minutes of the men's team match were the most exciting. The visiting team strived for victory, while the "August 1st" team was determined to seek a draw. In this short period of time, it was not only about comparing skills, but also about comparing wits. If the "August 1st" team had not changed its control ball play in the last ten seconds, it would have probably lost.

    俄罗斯男女队同“八一”队打成平手
    本报讯  昨晚俄罗斯男女篮球队在北京体育馆分别同“八一”男子红队和“八一”女子队进行了友谊比赛。结果女子队比赛62比62，男子队比赛61比61，双双言和。
    朱德副主席和邓小平、贺龙、陈毅、李富春、李先念、聂荣臻副总理观看了昨晚的比赛。
    “八一”女队该胜不胜
    女子队比赛始终在紧张热烈地进行。客队的特点是：出球迅速，奔跑活跃，篮下威胁力强；主队是：体力充沛，机警灵活，投篮较准，切入成功。这是一场势均力敌的比赛。
    第一节，客队维克申娜篮下首创纪录，接着齐里别尔鲍鲁又罚中一分，叶格列娃、巴宾科又相继中距命中。主队不甘示弱，陈常凤、石文苑等也于篮下或中距不断得分，比分从三比○逐渐上升：三比一；五比二；七比二；七比四；八比九；十一比九；十三比十四；十五比十四。客队以一分之优势胜了第一节。
    第二节客队以三十比二十八领了先。
    第三节，主队经过调兵遣将，显得更为活跃。石文苑篮下命中，陈常凤和彭淑甘等多次切入和中距得分，并且基本上控制了篮板球和看住了客队的叶格列娃，分数大大地超过了客队，最后以五十比三十八胜了第三节。第三节客队有点失常，攻守都不够好，十分钟中主队拿了二十二分，客队只拿了八分。
    第四节，是决定胜负的一节，双方都改变了打法。客队防守上改打全场盯人，进攻上改打快攻战术；主队则打控制球，稳扎稳打。客队的快攻到底好于主队的慢打，她们不断得分，比数逐渐接近，最后三分钟时，五十比五十六，主队只有六分优势了，这个优势也由于“慢打”战术的影响而在逐渐地降低。五十二比五十六；五十四比五十八；五十六比五十八；五十六比六十；五十八比六十；五十八比六十二。最后只有四十秒钟时，客队维克申娜中距和篮下连得两球，最后打成六十二比六十二平。
    本来主队已领先十二分，只要小心地打，胜是有希望的。但是在改打控制球时，因为队员球控制得不好，结果反失了不少分。昨晚“八一”女子队应该说是该胜不胜。
    “八一”红队求和得和
    男子队比赛开始，双方都采用快攻和结合拉开切入，防守上采用区域人盯人的打法。比赛进行了五分钟，“八一”红队周春霖和吴自秉连罚带投，连得七分。而客队得分手祖布科夫和康捷里被俞元煦和吴自秉死盯住，“神投手”克拉耶夫也被余邦基看死，一分未得。直到第六分钟才由祖布科夫罚入两球。以后客队克拉耶夫三次远投中的，卡尔林和康捷里一再投入，到第十分钟时已追成十六比十七反超出一分。“八一”队以快攻和拉开切入也连连得分。到上半时终了，打成了三十三平。“八一”队上半时，虽然遮板球拿到不多，但俞元煦和吴自秉把祖布科夫和康捷里看得还不错，因此能打成平手。
    下半时，竞争更为剧烈。场上比分经常是一二分之差，计差一分九次，差两分十次，平五次。下半场开始不到一分钟客队的投篮球能手克拉耶夫五次犯规被罚下，但他们的攻势并未减弱，在第十分钟时客队以一分领先。到最后三分钟时场上比数是五十七比六十一，客队已超出“八一”队四分。这时“八一”队改打全场紧逼。还剩下两分五十多秒时，祖布科夫传球失误被路廉翰截去，追成五十九比六十一。还剩下一分五十秒时，“八一”队又换上余邦基，王兆钰改打控制球，但这时他们还输一球。“八一”队见势不佳，立刻改变战术，积极争取投篮。在最后五秒时，路廉翰中路切入得分，比分成六十一平。这一球挽救了“八一”队的输局。
    男子队比赛的最后三分钟是最精彩的一段。客队力求得胜，“八一”队志在求和。在这短短的时间里，不仅要比技术，同时也在比智谋。“八一”队在最后十几秒时，如果不改变控制球的打法，恐怕就要输了。
