Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 4th: The Second Session of the First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party of Henan Province was held from November 12th to December 2nd.

During the meeting, Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, came to the meeting and gave important instructions on the current domestic and international situation, rectification, and leadership of the rural production upsurge.

After carefully conveying and studying the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the meeting used the forms of big airing, big blooming, big debate, and big-character posters to seriously examine the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and the work of the entire province since the closing of the Provincial Party Congress last year. The delegates wrote a total of 3,458 big-character posters in nearly ten days, raising 4,581 criticisms and suggestions. This achieved a situation where everyone spoke their minds and clarified right and wrong through debate. The meeting held that the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee had been basically correct over the past year and more, and the achievements in the work of the entire province had been enormous. However, there also existed serious right-leaning thinking; especially in a short period of time before the Fifth Plenary Session of the Provincial Party Committee in August this year, when illegal landlords, rich peasants, and wealthy middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas in the countryside were frantically attacking the socialist system in coordination with bourgeois rightists in the cities, the Provincial Party Committee made a mistake in its guiding ideology on certain issues by denying the struggle between the two roads in the countryside, thereby restricting the hands and feet of cadres and the masses. In handling the relationship between the state, agricultural cooperatives, and peasants, it also made the mistake of blindly speaking from the standpoint of wealthy middle peasants and adopting certain economic measures that catered to spontaneous capitalist tendencies. The meeting noted with satisfaction that the Provincial Party Committee resolutely and proactively conducted a review and correction of these problems at the Fifth Plenary Session in August, clarifying the ideological confusion it had caused within the Party and among the basic masses, further strengthening the unity of the entire Party, promoting the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses, and powerfully advancing the rectification campaign and the progress of all work.

The meeting then focused on discussing how to organize a great leap forward in agricultural production. First, it discussed the "Henan Province Plan for Implementing the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) (Revised Draft)" proposed by the Provincial Party Committee and the Henan Province 1958 National Economic Plan and other programs. These programs require: that the total grain output of the province reach 28.5 billion jin next year, an increase of 16% over the estimated output in 1957; that the total cotton output reach 420 million jin, an increase of 13% over this year; among them, it is required that one million mu of grain fields reach a yield of 1,000 jin of grain per mu, and one million mu of cotton fields reach a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. By 1967, the total grain output of the province should reach 57 billion jin, and the cotton output should reach 660 million jin, generally reaching or exceeding the grain and cotton production targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). In terms of farmland water conservancy construction, it is required that water and drought disasters be basically eliminated in the next ten years or so, and efforts should be made to achieve an irrigation area of 100 million mu to 110 million mu in the province by 1962, basically achieving water conservancy; the number of large livestock should reach 8.5 million by 1967, striving for 10 million; the number of pigs should be developed to 30 million, with an average of more than three pigs per household, except for some ethnic minority areas that do not raise pigs and areas where religious customs do not allow pig raising. The congress approved these reports and authorized the Provincial Party Committee to revise and supplement them based on the opinions raised at the congress, and then suggest that the Provincial People's Committee publish them as drafts to mobilize the people of the province and organizations, groups, the military, schools, and enterprises to discuss them.

The meeting held that the history of the two years since the realization of agricultural cooperation has created sufficient favorable conditions for organizing a great leap forward in agricultural production. The meeting refuted the conservative ideas of so-called "reaching the peak of production increase," "mountainous areas, low-lying waterlogged areas, and sandy saline-alkali areas cannot leap forward," and "agricultural production can only be gradual and cannot leap forward" with vivid and unparalleled facts. The meeting called on the entire Party to learn from the heroic spirit of Gansu Province in overcoming drought, overcome difficulties with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountain, and strive to realize the National Agricultural Development Program and the grand plan of "crossing the Huai River and crossing the Yangtze River" ahead of schedule.

In order to earnestly consolidate and promote the current new upsurge in production that has emerged in the countryside, the meeting held that it is necessary to closely coordinate with the production upsurge and launch a new upsurge of rectification and modification while rectifying, so that rectification and modification become the driving force for promoting the production upsurge. All agricultural cooperatives must adopt the three instructions on rectifying and consolidating agricultural cooperatives issued by the Central Committee on September 14 this year, use the methods of big airing, big blooming, and big debate, boldly mobilize the masses, earnestly carry out rectification work, deeply conduct socialist education, resolutely improve the work style of cadres, adjust the relationship between various members of the cooperative, and improve and strengthen production management, labor management, and financial management.

    中共河南省代表大会提出
　　掀起整改高潮推进农业生产高潮
    据新华社郑州4日电　中共河南省第一届代表大会第二次会议在11月12日到12月2日举行。
    会议期间，中共中央书记处书记谭震林曾到会对当前国内外形势、整风及农村生产高潮的领导等问题作了重要指示。
    会议认真传达和学习了党的八届三中全会精神后，运用大鸣、大放、大争、大字报的形式，严肃地检查了自去年省党代表大会闭幕后省委的领导和全省的工作。与会代表在前后近十天的时间里，共写大字报三千四百五十八张，提出批评与建议四千五百八十一条。达到了知无不言，并且通过辩论，划清了是非。会议认为一年多来省委的领导基本上是正确的，全省的工作成绩是巨大的，但同时存在着严重的右倾思想；特别在今年8月省委第五次全会前的一个短时间内，正当农村中不法地主、富农等和富裕中农中有严重资本主义思想的分子，配合城市资产阶级右派向社会主义制度猖狂进攻，省委对某些问题的指导思想上，却犯了否认农村中两条道路斗争的错误，而束缚了干部和群众的手脚；对国家、农业社和农民的关系处理上，也犯了盲目站在富裕中农立场上说话的错误，而采取了某些迁就资本主义自发倾向的经济措施。会议满意地指出：今年8月省委在第五次全会上对于这些问题坚决地、主动地进行了检讨和纠正，澄清了在党内和基本群众中由此引起的一度的思想混乱，进一步增强了全党的团结，发扬了广大群众的社会主义积极性，有力地推进了全民整风和各项工作的进展。
    会议接着着重讨论了如何组织农业生产大跃进的问题。首先讨论了省委所提出的“河南省贯彻执行全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的规划（修正草案）”和河南省1958年度国民经济计划等方案。这些方案要求：明年全省粮食总产量要达到二百八十五亿斤，较1957年预计产量增加16％；棉花总产量要达到四亿二千万斤，较今年增加13％；其中，要求有一百万亩粮田达到亩产粮食一千斤，一百万亩棉田达到亩产皮棉一百斤。到1967年，全省粮食总产量要达到五百七十亿斤，棉花产量达到六万六千万斤，普遍达到或超过农业发展纲要（修正草案）中所规定的粮棉生产指标。在兴修农田水利方面，要求在今后十年左右，基本上消灭水、旱灾，并争取在1962年全省灌溉面积达到一亿亩到一亿一千万亩，基本上实现水利化；大家畜到1967年达到八百五十万头，争取一千万头；猪发展三千万头，除某些不养猪的少数民族地区和因宗教习惯不养猪的以外，每户平均养猪三头以上。大会批准了这些报告，并授权省委根据大会所提的意见，加以修改和补充后，建议省人民委员会作为草案公布，发动全省人民和机关、团体、军队、学校、企业进行讨论。
    会议认为：实现农业合作化后两年来的历史，已为组织农业生产大跃进创造了充分的有利条件。会议以生动无比的事实，批驳了所谓“增产到顶”，“山区、低洼易涝区、沙荒盐碱地区不能跃进”和“农业生产只能渐进不能跃进”的保守思想。会议号召全党要学习甘肃省提出的战胜干旱的英雄气概，以愚公移山的精神克服困难，为力争提前实现全国农业发展纲要和“跨淮河、过长江”的雄伟计划而奋斗。
    为了认真地巩固和推进当前农村已经出现的生产新高潮，会议认为必须紧密配合生产高潮，掀起一个边整边改的新高潮，使整改成为推动生产高潮的动力。所有农业社都要根据中央今年9月14日发布的整顿巩固农业社的三个指示，采用大鸣、大放、大争的方法，放手发动群众，认真开展整社工作，深入进行社会主义教育，坚决改进干部作风，调整社内各部分社员的关系，改进与加强生产管理、劳动管理和财务管理。
