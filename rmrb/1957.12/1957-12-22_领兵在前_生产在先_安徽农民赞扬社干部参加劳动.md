Leading Troops at the Forefront, Production First

Anhui Peasants Praise Township Cadres for Participating in Labor

    (By our newspaper) This newspaper reports that among the more than 15,000 agricultural cooperatives in Anhui Province, 85% of the full-time cadres, totaling more than 75,000 people, have participated in labor. They helped the masses solve various problems in a timely manner during production, promoting production. Since April of this year, Fan Bingdong, the supervisor of the Xingguang Cooperative in Qianshan County, has participated in production and discovered 15 cases of concealment of production and private distribution, most of which were reported and exposed to him by the masses while he was working alongside them.
    While participating in production, the cooperative cadres have also trained and improved themselves. Chen Guoyuan, the director of the Red Star Cooperative in Taihu County, said: “After participating in production, I have increased my capital for leading production. I have a better grasp of the actual situation, and it is easier to solve problems when meetings are held."
    The participation of cooperative cadres in production has also improved the relationship between cadres and the masses. In the past, the cooperative members had great opinions about cadres who did not participate in production. Before Zhang Xiulan, the deputy director of the Red Star Cooperative in Feidong County, participated in production, the cooperative members disliked him for eating without working. After he participated in production, the cooperative members treated him like a family member, and every team welcomed him. The masses praised these cadres who participated in production, saying:
  "Work during the day, work at night; lead the troops at the forefront, production first; good at both writing and fighting, they are our good stewards, good cadres of the people."
    The participation of cadres in production has also had a great impact on social atmosphere. In the Dongjiang Third Cooperative in Fanchang County, many young people looked down on agricultural labor and asked the cooperative to introduce them to work in mines and cities as workers. Now, seeing that the cadres are all participating in production, they have changed their views and are settled down to agricultural production.
    In addition, the labor achievements of cadres participating in production are also very significant. Since this spring, more than 2,000 cadres in 14 counties of the Bengbu Special Zone have completed more than 650,000 workdays, reducing the cooperative's expenses.
    Many agricultural cooperatives have adopted methods that are tailored to the individual when cadres participate in production. For example, in the Xinguang Cooperative in Qianshan County, because the accountant's business relationships meant he could not be far away, he was assigned to participate in production in a nearby production team. The supervisor often had to go to various places to conduct inspections, so he adopted a mobile production method.

### 领兵在前  生产在先  安徽农民赞扬社干部参加劳动

    领兵在前  生产在先
    安徽农民赞扬社干部参加劳动
    本报讯  安徽省一万五千多个农业社的脱产干部中，已有占脱产干部总数85％，计七万五千多人参加了劳动。他们在生产中帮助群众及时解决了各种各样问题，推动了生产。潜山县星光社监察主任范兵同从今年4月参加生产以来，发现瞒产私分等的行为十五起，其中大部分都是他和群众一块劳动生产中群众向他反映、揭发出来的。
    社干部在参加生产的同时也锻炼和提高了自己，太湖县红星社主任陈国元说：“参加生产后，给我领导生产增加了不少本钱。实际情况掌握得多，开起会来问题就好解决些。”
    社干部参加生产后也改善了干群关系。过去社员对不参加生产的干部意见很大，肥东县红星社副主任张秀兰没有参加生产前，社员们嫌他不劳动光吃饭。他参加生产后，社员们把他当亲人看待，队队欢迎。群众赞扬这些参加生产的干部说：
  “白天生产，晚上工作；领兵在前，生产在先；能文能武是我们的好当家，是人民的好干部”。
    干部参加生产后对社会风气的影响也很大，繁昌县东江三社有很多青年轻视农业劳动，要求社介绍上矿山进城市去做工人。现在看见干部都参加生产，才改变了看法，安心农业生产。
    此外，干部参加生产的劳动成绩也很大，蚌埠专区十四个县的二千多个干部，今春参加生产以来，已做了六十五万多个劳动日，减少了社的开支。
    许多农业社干部参加生产都采取因人制宜的办法。如潜山县新光社因会计员的业务关系，不能远离，就采用固定在附近的生产队参加生产。监察主任经常要到各处去进行检查，就采用流动生产的办法。
