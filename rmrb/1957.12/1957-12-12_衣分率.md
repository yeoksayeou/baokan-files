Noun Explanation

    Ginning Percentage
    The amount of lint cotton ginned from every hundred catties of seed cotton is the ginning percentage. Due to differences in variety and planting conditions, the amount of lint cotton that can be ginned from seed cotton varies. A high ginning percentage means more lint cotton is ginned; a low ginning percentage means less lint cotton is ginned. A ginning percentage of 30% means that thirty catties of lint cotton are ginned from every hundred catties of seed cotton. Generally speaking, seed cotton with large flowers and long fibers has a higher ginning percentage and can produce more lint cotton.

    衣分率
    每百斤籽棉轧出的皮棉数量就是衣分率。由于品种和种植条件不同，籽棉能轧出的皮棉数量有所区别，衣分高就是指轧出的皮棉多；衣分低，就是轧出的皮棉少。30％的衣分，就是每一百斤籽棉轧出三十斤皮棉。一般地说，花大绒长的籽棉衣分率就高，就能多出皮棉。
