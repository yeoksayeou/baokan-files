Xinhua News Agency, December 30th dispatch from TASS, Paris, December 29th: Newspapers here report that armed conflicts between the Algerian National Liberation Army and French troops are continuing in Algeria. The most intense clashes are in the area of Omaria (Algiers province).

According to a broadcast by Radio Paris on December 29th, French troops have launched extensive "pacification" operations in western Algeria, arresting many suspected of sympathizing with the national liberation movement.

However, the French people long for a peaceful resolution to the Algerian issue. A public opinion survey conducted by the French National Peace Council in many provinces regarding a negotiated settlement of the Algerian question showed that the vast majority of people advocated immediate negotiations. For example, in Guaya (Aveyron province), 639 out of 657 families surveyed signed a petition demanding the restoration of peace in Algeria. Of the 86 people surveyed at the "Hatchkiss-Berazot" factory, 82 were in favor of negotiations.

Xinhua News Agency, December 30th dispatch from Paris: French Prime Minister Gaillard obtained two votes of confidence from the National Assembly on the evening of December 29th regarding the government's proposed draft of the so-called "Fundamental Law" for Algeria and the "Electoral Law" for Algeria. The votes supporting the government were mainly from members of various right-wing and far-right parties.

　　法国人民渴望和平解决
    据新华社30日讯据塔斯社巴黎29日讯：此间报纸报道，阿尔及利亚民族解放军部队与法国军队之间的武装冲突在阿尔及利亚仍在继续。最激烈的冲突是在奥马里地区（阿尔及尔省）。
    据巴黎广播电台29日广播，法国军队在阿尔及利亚西部展开了广泛的“绥靖”战斗，逮捕了许多同情民族解放运动的嫌疑犯。
    但是，法国人民渴望用和平途径解决阿尔及利亚问题。法国全国和平理事会在许多省举行的关于用谈判方式解决阿尔及利亚问题的民意测验证明，绝大多数人都主张马上举行谈判。例如，在瓜亚（阿维隆省）的六百五十七个被测验的家庭中，有六百三十九户在要求恢复阿尔及利亚和平的请愿书上签了名。“哈乞开斯—贝腊若”工厂被测验的八十六人中，有八十二人主张谈判。
    据新华社30日讯　巴黎消息：法国总理盖伊阿29日晚间先后获得了国民议会就政府所提出的所谓阿尔及利亚“根本法”草案和阿尔及利亚“选举法”草案所举行的两次信任投票。投票支持政府的主要是各个右翼和极右翼政党的议员。
