Localism is Incompatible with Communism
CCP Guangdong Provincial Congress Thoroughly Criticizes Localism
Localism is a product of the combination of extreme individualism and feudal sectarianism. Localism can never represent local interests; it only represents the interests of a few ambitious elements. Only communism and the central line and policies truly represent the interests of the people in all parts of the country.
Thoroughly eliminate localism! This was a major slogan at the Second Session of the First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Guangdong Provincial Congress. In the opening speech by Comrade Chen Yu, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and the concluding report by Comrade Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, the localistic errors of some comrades within the Guangdong Party organization were severely criticized.
After Guangdong opposed localism in 1952, localistic thinking has resurfaced in recent years. They questioned the principles, policies, and major measures adopted by the Party during the democratic revolution and attempted to overturn them.
As early as 1952, the Guangdong Party organization resolutely implemented the central government's instructions, carried out the struggle against localism, overcame the right-leaning tendencies in the peasant movement, and completed the land reform throughout the province. This fundamentally changed the slow and backward state of Guangdong's work, quickly catching up with the progress of the whole country and beginning the construction of the first Five-Year Plan. However, some comrades did not truly learn from this experience and receive education, and the roots of localism were not completely eliminated. In recent years, especially since the second half of last year, this thinking has resurfaced and begun to be active again. They have expressed disagreement with some of the principles, policies, and certain major measures adopted during the democratic revolution stage, which the central government and the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee had already concluded, and attempted to reverse them. Since last year, some people have said that the central government's policy of relying on the army, relying on the southern cadres, and having the army and southern cadres "take command" was wrong, that the land reform rectification was greatly deviated, that the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee was implementing a "sectarian" policy, that the past anti-localism was wrong, and so on. As a result, they adopted an attitude of distrust towards the leadership of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee. Some people even went around instigating and spreading rumors. More seriously, a small number of people even formed small cliques, colluding with each other, carrying out anti-Party activities, and maliciously smearing and attacking the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, especially certain cadres in Hainan who were the most prominent. Last year, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee used great effort and adopted an extremely patient attitude to help these comrades improve their thinking, but some of them said that the Provincial Party Committee used repressive methods to solve problems. Many erroneous remarks and some unhealthy emotions have also appeared in other areas of Guangdong.
The meeting pointed out that this localism hindered the unity within the Party and caused great losses to the Party's work. At the same time, due to the malicious spread by some people, a blind localistic sentiment was generated among some cadres, and right-wing elements inside and outside the Party also used this point to launch a frantic attack on the Party.
During the democratic revolution, the central government's proposal to rely on the army, rely on southern cadres, and have the army and southern cadres "take command" quickly changed the situation of hindering land reform and resisting central instructions. This was a timely and brilliant measure.
The meeting held that the central government's principles and measures such as relying on the army, relying on southern cadres, having the army and southern cadres "take command," and opposing localism during the democratic revolution were completely correct and timely. Organizational lines must obey political lines. In order to achieve political tasks in a certain period, the Party must take corresponding organizational measures. During the democratic revolution, the Party's main task in the countryside was to eliminate the landlord class in order to rapidly liberate rural productive forces and create conditions for national industrialization and agricultural cooperation. This was the greatest interest and most urgent demand of the people across the country at that time. Due to historical reasons, the cadres who originally persisted in the struggle in Guangdong generally lacked the experience of class struggle and mobilizing the masses. It was difficult for them to take on the responsibility of leading the land reform, and some leading comrades in Guangdong at that time had serious right-leaning and localistic thinking, which caused the land reform to lose its direction, commit the error of peaceful land reform, and in fact resisted the central government and the Central South Bureau's instructions to correct these errors. At that time, if the leadership was not changed in time, Guangdong's land reform would not be done well, the poor and lower-middle peasants would not be mobilized, and the landlord class would not be truly eliminated. The central government and the Central South Bureau's policy of relying on the army, relying on southern cadres, and having the army and southern cadres "take command" was decided under these circumstances. The former South China Sub-Bureau and the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, due to their resolute implementation of the central government and the Central South Bureau's policies, did a good job in Guangdong's land reform, gradually bringing Guangdong's work in line with other regions. It is absolutely wrong and should not be to doubt or even oppose this policy now.
The rectification of the ranks and opposition to localism in the land reform were very necessary; otherwise, they could not have undertaken the task of eliminating the landlord class. This was a struggle between wanting communism and wanting individualism and localism.
Some people doubt the necessity of rectifying the ranks in the land reform and insist that the deviations at that time were very large. The meeting held that this statement is contrary to the facts. Everyone knows that in order to carry out land reform, there must be a team led by proletarian ideology. In order to enable the land reform team to stand on the correct position, it is necessary to rectify the team. This is indispensable when carrying out land reform in any place. Before the rectification of the ranks, the cadre ranks in Guangdong were very impure. If they were not seriously rectified, they could not have undertaken the task of eliminating the landlord class. In essence, the rectification of the ranks and the opposition to localism at that time was a reflection of class struggle within the Party, a struggle between the correct position and the wrong position, a struggle between wanting communism and wanting individualism and localism. Looking at the results of the rectification in Guangdong at that time, the achievements were enormous. In such urgent circumstances, it was difficult to completely avoid individual shortcomings in the work. Moreover, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and the Party committees at all levels attached great importance to such shortcomings and did a lot of follow-up work. It is unfounded to think that the rectification of the ranks was greatly deviated.
The highest principle of the Party's cadre policy is first and foremost communistization, not the localization of cadres. In recent years, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee has correctly implemented the central government's cadre policy, firmly relying on the army and the southern cadres, while also earnestly cultivating local cadres. The so-called "emphasis on the North and neglect of the South" is contrary to the facts.
Some people suspect that the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee's implementation of the cadre policy has sectarianism, saying that the Provincial Party Committee's cadre policy is "emphasizing the North and neglecting the South," saying that outside cadres are promoted quickly while local cadres are promoted slowly. The meeting believes that this statement is also wrong and is a reflection of localistic sentiments. The localization of cadres is not the highest principle of the Party's cadre policy. The highest principle of the Party's cadre policy is first and foremost communistization. In recent years, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee has correctly implemented the central government's cadre policy. On the one hand, the Provincial Party Committee has resolutely implemented the policy of relying on the army, relying on the southern cadres, and having the army and the southern cadres "take command." At the same time, it has also cultivated local cadres very earnestly. In fact, local cadres have gradually grown up under the cultivation of the Provincial Party Committee and the Party committees at all levels in recent years. Currently, many people are shouldering the responsibility of leadership in various positions, and the promotion of many local cadres is still quite fast. The vast majority of southern cadres have worked very well in Guangdong. They have established connections with the local masses, they can reflect the correct opinions of the masses, and they have in fact been localized. Is it possible to only promote local cadres in Guangdong and not outside cadres? Does promoting outside cadres according to the criteria of both ability and integrity mean sectarianism? Is it possible to not base the promotion of local cadres on the principle of both ability and integrity? This kind of thinking is only a localistic, feudalistic ideology, and it has no similarity with our Party's cadre policy.
The meeting clearly pointed out: Localism is a product of the combination of extreme individualism and feudal sectarianism, and it is absolutely incompatible with communism. Localism can never represent local interests; it only represents the interests of a few ambitious elements. Only communism and the central line and policies truly represent the interests of the people in all parts of the country. Therefore, localist elements are bound to resist the central government's political line and organizational line and carry out anti-Party non-organizational activities. The result is bound to undermine the unity of the Party, ruin a large number of cadres, damage the relationship between the Party and the masses and between the army and the people, and undermine the cause of socialism. Localism is a major obstacle to the socialist revolution and socialist construction currently underway in Guangdong. Only by resolutely and uncompromisingly eliminating it can the cause of revolution and construction develop by leaps and bounds.
There are some people in the Guangdong Party who have localistic sentiments and thinking, but there are very few people who have serious localistic thinking and have begun to carry out anti-Party activities. Generally, people with localistic sentiments and thinking will resolutely draw a line with localism and join the ranks of opposing localism once they recognize the nature of the problem and improve their ideological awareness. Therefore, the meeting believes that these comrades should be encouraged to conduct ideological self-examination consciously and voluntarily, help them to remove their ideological burdens, improve their communist consciousness, and not be given organizational punishment. A small number of people with serious localistic thinking or even anti-Party actions, if they truly recognize their mistakes, repent of their past, deeply examine themselves, and are determined to correct them, should also adopt the principle of strict ideological examination and lenient organizational handling. However, those individuals whose mistakes are extremely serious and who do not repent must be disciplined.
In order to thoroughly eliminate localism, the congress made decisions such as launching a major debate on historical issues in Guangdong, strengthening democratic life within the Party, and strengthening principles and discipline.
In order to thoroughly eliminate localism, the Guangdong Provincial Party Congress called on the entire Party in Guangdong to once again study the Central Committee's Seventh Plenary Session's Fourth Plenary Session's resolution on strengthening unity and made the following decisions:
1.  Launch a major debate on historical issues in Guangdong among cadres at the county level and above throughout the province, thoroughly clarify the major issues of right and wrong in Guangdong's history since liberation, strengthen communist education, and eliminate the influence of localism and feudal regional concepts.
2.  Further strengthen democratic life within the Party and fully promote democracy within the Party. All Party members, especially members of Party committees at all levels above the county level and Party member cadres above the section level, should raise different opinions on various major issues to a certain Party meeting for discussion. After the Party committee makes a decision, they are allowed to reserve different opinions, but they are not allowed to spread them everywhere, and non-organizational collusion activities inside and outside the Party should be especially prohibited. Oppose liberalist small broadcasts.
3.  Strengthen principles and discipline, and safeguard the unity of the Party as if protecting our eyes. Everything that is conducive to unity should be said, and everything that is conducive to unity should be done; everything that is not conducive to unity should be resolutely not said, and everything that is not conducive to unity should be resolutely not done.
4.  Senior cadres, especially local senior cadres, bear a particularly important responsibility for eliminating localism and strengthening unity within the Party. Senior cadres must realize that their correct words and actions will have a beneficial impact, while wrong words and actions will bring serious harm. Senior cadres must be more vigilant and demand themselves with strict communist principles in order to further unite the entire Party through their unity.
5.  The highest principle of the Party's cadre policy is communistization. All outside cadres and local cadres must unite more closely under the principle of communism. It must be affirmed that outside cadres have resolutely implemented the instructions of the central government, have done a lot of work in Guangdong, have played a decisive role in changing the backward state of Guangdong's work, and have also made great efforts in uniting and helping local cadres. The vast majority of outside cadres are already familiar with the situation in Guangdong and have established close ties with the local masses. In order to complete the task of socialist revolution and construction in Guangdong, they should be more humble and prudent in the future, overcome their shortcomings, unite local cadres more closely, strengthen ties with the masses, and establish the idea of settling down in Guangdong, so as to achieve localization. Under the leadership of the Party, local cadres have made great progress and improvement through successive movements in recent years and are playing an increasingly important role in Guangdong's work. Many people have been promoted to leadership positions at all levels and have become the main backbone. To do a good job in Guangdong in the future, we must also rely on the better efforts of local cadres. Local cadres should further strengthen unity with outside cadres, learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and overcome their weaknesses, work together with one heart and one mind, and strive to complete the historical task of socialist revolution and socialist construction in Guangdong.

### 地方主义同共产主义不相容  中共广东省代表大会彻底批判地方主义

　　地方主义同共产主义不相容
    中共广东省代表大会彻底批判地方主义
    地方主义是极端个人主义同封建宗派主义相结合的产物。地方主义绝不可能代表地方利益，它只是代表少数野心分子的利益，真正代表全国各个地方人民群众利益的只有共产主义，只有中央的路线和政策。
    彻底肃清地方主义！这是中国共产党广东省第一届代表大会第二次会议上的一个主要的口号。在省委书记陈郁同志的开幕词和省委第一书记陶铸同志的总结报告中，都严正地批判了广东省党组织内一部分同志的地方主义的错误。
    一九五二年广东省反对地方主义以后，几年来地方主义思想又重新抬头。他们怀疑党在民主革命阶段采取的方针政策和重大措施，企图翻案。
    早在1952年，广东党组织就坚决贯彻执行中央的指示，进行了反对地方主义的斗争，克服了农民运动中的右倾，完成了全省的土地改革。这样，就从根本上改变了广东省工作迟缓落后的状态，迅速赶上全国的进度，开始了第一个五年计划的建设。但是有些同志没有真正从中接受教训，得到教育，地方主义的根子没有彻底清除。这几年来，特别是去年下半年以来，这种思想又抬头了，又开始活动了。他们对过去中央和广东省委早已做了结论的在民主革命阶段的若干方针、政策和某些重大措施表示异议，企图翻案。去年以来，就有人说中央所提出的依靠大军、依靠南下干部、由大军和南下干部“挂帅”的方针是不对的，说土改整队偏差很大，说广东省委执行的是“宗派主义”政策，说过去反地方主义是不对的等等。这样，他们对于广东省委的领导就采取不信任的态度。有些人更是到处进行挑拨，播弄是非。更严重的是，有少数人竟形成了小集团，互相串连，进行反党活动，恶意地对广东省委进行污蔑和攻击，尤其是以海南某些干部最为突出。去年广东省委以很大力量，采取极其耐心的态度去帮助这些同志提高思想，但他们中有些人反说省委用压的办法来解决问题。广东其他地区也出现了不少错误的言论和某些不健康的情绪。
    会议指出，这种地方主义，妨碍了党内的团结，使党的工作遭受到很大的损失。同时，又由于某些人的恶意传播，在部分干部中产生了盲目的地方主义情绪，而党内党外的右派分子也利用这一点向党进行了疯狂的进攻。
    在民主革命阶段，中央提出依靠大军，依靠南下干部，由大军和南下干部“挂帅”的方针，迅速改变了阻碍土地改革，抗拒中央指示的状况，这是及时的和英明的措施。
    会议认为，在民主革命阶段，中央提出依靠大军、依靠南下干部、由大军和南下干部“挂帅”、反对地方主义等项方针和措施是完全正确的和及时的。组织路线要服从政治路线，党为了实现一定时期的政治任务，就要采取相应的组织措施。民主革命阶段，党在农村的主要任务是消灭地主阶级，以便迅速地解放农村的生产力，为国家工业化和农业合作化创造条件。这是当时全国人民的最大利益和最迫切的要求。由于历史原因，原来在广东坚持斗争的干部一般比较缺乏阶级斗争的锻炼和发动群众的经验，要他们担起领导土改的责任是有困难的，而且当时广东某些领导同志又存在着严重的右倾和地方主义思想，因而使土改迷失了方向，犯了和平土改的错误，并且对中央和中南局纠正这些错误的指示实际上采取了抗拒的态度。那时，如果不及时改变领导，广东的土改是无法做好的，贫雇农是发动不起来的，地主阶级是不会真正被消灭的。中央和中南局提出依靠大军、依靠南下干部、由大军和南下干部“挂帅”的方针，正是在这种情况下决定的。前华南分局和广东省委由于坚决执行中央、中南局的方针，因而搞好了广东的土改，使广东的工作逐渐跟上其他地区。现在还来怀疑甚至反对这个方针，是绝对不应该的，是完全错误的。
    土地改革中整顿队伍和反对地方主义十分必要，否则就不能担负起消灭地主阶级的任务，这是要共产主义还是要个人主义和地方主义的斗争。
    有人怀疑土改中整顿队伍的必要性，而且硬说当时的偏差很大。会议认为，这种说法是违反事实的。谁都知道，要进行土改就必须有一个无产阶级思想领导的队伍，为了使土改队伍能够站在正确的立场就必须进行整队，这在任何地方进行土改的时候都是必不可少的。整顿队伍以前的广东干部队伍是十分不纯的，如果不认真整顿，就不能担负起消灭地主阶级的任务。实质上，当时的整顿队伍和反地方主义，是阶级斗争在党内的一种反映，是正确立场和错误立场之间的斗争，是要共产主义还是要个人主义、地方主义的斗争。从广东当时的整队结果来看，成绩是巨大的，在运动那样紧迫的情况下，工作中发生个别缺点也是很难完全避免的，而且，就是对于那样一点的缺点，广东省委和各级党委也很重视，做了不少的善后工作。认为整顿队伍偏差很大，是没有根据的。
    党的干部政策的最高原则首先是共产主义化，而不是干部地方化。几年来，广东省委正确地执行了中央的干部政策，既坚决地依靠大军，依靠南下干部，又认真地培养本地干部，所谓“重北轻南”的说法是违反事实的。
    有些人怀疑广东省委执行干部政策有宗派主义，说省委的干部政策是“重北轻南”，说外来干部提拔得快而本地干部提拔得慢。会议认为，这种说法同样是错误的，是地方主义情绪的一种反映。干部地方化并不是党的干部政策的最高原则。党的干部政策的最高原则首先是共产主义化。几年来，广东省委是正确地执行了中央的干部政策的。省委一方面坚决执行了依靠大军、依靠南下干部、由大军、南下干部“挂帅”的方针，同时又非常认真地培养本地干部。事实上，这几年来在省委和各级党委的培养下，地方干部逐渐地生长起来了。目前许多人在各种岗位上担负起领导工作的责任，许多地方干部的提拔还是相当快的。而绝大多数的南下干部在广东工作得很好，他们已和本地群众建立了联系，他们能反映群众的正确意见，他们事实上已经地方化了。难道在广东只能提拔本地干部而不能提拔外来干部？难道根据德才兼备的标准提拔了外来干部就是叫宗派主义？难道在提拔本地干部的时候可以不根据德才兼备的原则？这种想法只是一种地方主义、封建主义的思想，它和我们党的干部政策是毫无相似之处的。
    会议明确地指出：地方主义是极端个人主义同封建宗派主义相结合的产物，是同共产主义绝不相容的。地方主义绝不可能代表地方利益，它只是代表少数野心分子的利益。真正代表全国各个地方人民群众利益的只有共产主义，只有中央的路线政策。因此，地方主义分子必然要抗拒中央的政治路线和组织路线，进行反党的非组织活动。其结果必然要破坏党的团结，葬送大批干部，破坏党群关系和军民关系，破坏社会主义事业。地方主义是目前广东省进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的重大障碍，只有坚决地、毫不姑息地彻底加以清除，革命和建设事业才能大踏步地向前发展。
    在广东党内有一部分人是存在着地方主义情绪和思想的，但是有严重的地方主义思想，并且开始进行反党活动的人则是极少数。一般有地方主义情绪和思想的人，当他们一旦认识到问题的性质，提高了思想觉悟之后，必然会坚决同地方主义划清界线，参加到反对地方主义的行列中来。因此，会议认为，对这些同志，应当鼓励他们自动自觉地进行思想检查，帮助他们解除思想包袱，提高共产主义觉悟，不作组织处分，少数有严重地方主义思想甚至有反党行动的人，如果他们真正认识错误，痛悔前非，深刻检讨，决心改正，也采用思想检查从严、组织处理从宽的原则；但对其中个别错误极为严重而又不悔改的人，必须绳之以纪律。
    为了彻底肃清地方主义，大会作出开展广东历史问题的大辩论、加强党内民主生活、加强原则性和纪律性等项决定。
    为了彻底肃清地方主义，广东省党代表大会号召广东全党再一次学习党中央七届四中全会关于加强团结的决议，并作出如下决定：
    1、在全省县以上机关干部中开展广东历史问题的大辩论，彻底弄清解放以来广东历史上的几个重大问题的大是大非，加强共产主义教育，清除地方主义和封建地域观念的影响。
    2、进一步加强党内民主生活，充分发扬党内民主。所有党员特别是县以上各级党委委员和科以上党员干部对各种重大问题的不同意见，应当提到党的一定的会议上来讨论。在党委作出决定之后，允许保留不同意见，但不允许到处散播，特别应当禁止党内外一切非组织的串连活动。反对自由主义小广播。
    3、加强原则性和纪律性，要像维护眼珠那样维护党的团结。一切有利于团结的话应该说，有利于团结的事应该做；一切不利于团结的话就坚决不说，不利于团结的事就坚决不做。
    4、高级干部特别是本地的高级干部对肃清地方主义、加强党内团结负有特殊重要的责任。高级干部必须认识到自己的正确的言论与行动将产生有益的影响，而错误的言论和行动，则将带来严重的危害。高级干部必须提高警惕，用严格的共产主义原则来要求自己，以便通过他们的团结，进一步把全党团结起来。
    5、党的干部政策的最高原则是共产主义化。所有外来干部和本地干部必须在共产主义的原则下更加亲密地团结起来。必须肯定，外来干部坚决执行了中央的指示，在广东做了很多工作，对改变广东工作的落后状态起着决定性的作用，在团结和帮助本地干部方面也作了巨大的努力，绝大部分外来干部已经熟悉广东情况，与本地群众亦已建立了密切的联系；为了完成广东的社会主义革命和建设任务，今后应当更加谦虚谨慎，克服自己的缺点，更紧密地团结本地干部，密切同群众的联系，树立在广东安家落户的思想，做到地方化。本地干部这几年来在党的领导下，经过历次运动，有了很大的进步和提高，对广东工作日益起着重要的作用，许多人已被提拔到各级领导岗位上来，成为主要骨干。今后要做好广东工作，也必须依靠本地干部更好的努力。本地干部要进一步加强同外来干部的团结，互相学习，取长补短，同心协力，为完成广东的社会主义革命与社会主义建设的历史任务而斗争。
