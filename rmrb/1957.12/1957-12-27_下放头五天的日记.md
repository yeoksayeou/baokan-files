The First Five Days of Working Down Below
Wang Sui

Editor's Note: This article is well worth reading. The author, Wang Sui, was originally the secretary director of the Tianjin Steel Plant director's office, and later served as the director of a workshop for four months. This time, he was assigned to work as a furnace repair bricklayer.

In the process of participating in labor, Comrade Wang Sui humbly learned from his master and fellow workers, constantly discovering the merits of the working people and always thinking about his own weaknesses. He not only learned production skills, but also improved his ideological style. This enthusiasm for learning is essential for every cadre sent to work at lower levels.

When participating in labor, Comrade Wang Sui was determined to develop his ability to endure hardship, not only gritting his teeth and enduring ordinary backaches and leg pains, but also using a strong will to spur himself on, persisting in labor while ill, and overcoming his illness through labor. This tenacious spirit is also essential for every cadre sent to work at lower levels.

November 25th

After working in the Tianjin Steel Plant director's office for several years, and then serving as the director of the steelmaking department for four months, the Party Committee approved my assignment to work as a furnace repair bricklayer. Today is the first day I participated in labor, working the first middle shift. The worker comrades were particularly warm to me today. As soon as I entered the workshop, they all gathered around to ask about my well-being. The team leader gave me a complete set of work clothes, as well as a hammer and a trowel. At three o'clock, I followed Master He to the open hearth furnace upstairs to take over the shift. Master He was building a trough, and I was supplying him with mud and moving bricks. A firebrick weighs about five kilograms, and I carried five at a time. After carrying two loads, I felt sore in my arms. The small mud buckets also felt particularly heavy after holding them for a long time. It seems I really need to exercise well.

During the break, I stacked the bricks neatly and swept the dirty soil into a pile, preparing to carry it away with a shovel. Master He stopped me and said, "Don't throw it away, give it to me." He climbed onto the gas duct, and I handed him the soil bucket by bucket. He filled all the soil on the gas duct. After filling it, he climbed down and told me, "The newly replaced gas duct has seams that haven't expanded tightly yet, and it's always smoking. Without this soil, we would have to buy new river sand to fill it. Using this dirty soil to fill it not only cleans the ground but also saves river sand, which is a double win. We bricklayers have to save money for the country from these bricks and soil!" This was the first lesson Master gave me. Before, when I was sitting in the office, I didn't know that the worker comrades were accumulating funds for the country in this way, bit by bit.

I finished work at eleven o'clock at night. After taking a shower, I got home after one o'clock. There was thin porridge warming on the stove, and fried eggs on the table. Under the plate, my wife left me a note: "Congratulations on your first day of glorious labor. Eat well and sleep well."

November 26th

Today I'm working the night shift. I didn't get to the factory until ten o'clock in the evening. On this winter night, there were very few pedestrians on the road. But after crossing Jiefang Bridge, the situation was very different: there were a lot of female workers going to the nearby cotton mill for the night shift, some of them pushing baby carriages. They were walking and chatting. Before I didn't work the night shift, I never thought that the winter night would be so lively.

Today's job is to process magnesia bricks for furnace repair downstairs. I saw other comrades process a magnesia brick into the required shape with a dozen chisels. I picked up the hammer and chisel and did the same. I didn't expect the magnesia brick to be so hard. I hit it hard, but only a little bit came off, and my hand hurt a lot. I worked for a long time but still couldn't finish one brick, and the surface I was working on was uneven. Master He told me, "You have to chisel out a series of grooves along one end first, and then use the hammer to knock off the high spots." I tried it according to his words, and it was much better. I never thought that there was so much to learn even from hitting a brick!

After hitting it for a while, the shape of the brick was almost right, but it was not as fast as the other comrades. I felt a little anxious, and used too much force. I broke the brick in half with one hammer blow. This brick was transported from Anshan from far away, and it was very expensive. I hadn't done much work, and I had already broken one. I felt very ashamed. Master He came over, picked up the brick, and looked at it. He said, "Don't worry, you can't catch up with everyone when you first start working; this brick already had a crack, so it's not entirely your fault." I made a reject, and Master He treated me with a combination of criticism and comfort, which made me feel indescribably moved. I remembered when I used to be a leader, if there was an accident, I wouldn't analyze the reasons or look for lessons, and I would just get angry with the comrades without asking questions. That kind of behavior was so undesirable!

Around three o'clock at night, a northwest wind rose, and it started to snow. Master He found a mat and put it around the open hearth furnace, and said to me, "You can't stand the cold, go inside and warm up a bit." I told him and the other comrades to go, but none of them went. They also told me, "We're used to it, it doesn't matter; this is your first time, you need to warm up a bit, go quickly."

After four o'clock, Little Ning and I followed Master He to build the bottom of the steel ladle. The steel ladle had just been poured with steel. Although it had cooled down for a while, it was still like being in a steamer when we went inside. Master He went in, bent down, and started laying bricks. I handed him bricks and mud. It was too hot, so I took off my clothes, but it was still hot and uncomfortable. But seeing Master He sweating profusely and still squatting there laying bricks, I had no choice but to endure it. After Master He finished laying the bricks, he also checked the place where Comrade Little Ning had laid them and filled in a few places. Only after he had finished did he climb out of the steel ladle. When we returned to the rest room, it was already dawn.

November 27th

I slept all day, feeling dizzy, and didn't want to eat anything. My wife was very worried and said, "You must have a cold, you have a high fever, and you haven't eaten anything. Take a day off today and go to the hospital to see a doctor." I thought to myself: I just started participating in production labor for two days and I'm already lying down, is that appropriate? I gritted my teeth and got out of bed, forced myself to drink some water, and ate a bowl of rice before rushing to the factory for the night shift.

When the worker comrades saw that I looked unwell, and felt that I had a fever, they all told me to go home and rest. I said it didn't matter, I would feel better after sweating a bit. When Master He saw that I insisted on working, he laid out the bricks for me in a relatively warm place, and also found a few straw bags to spread out, saying, "You sit here and work, rest if you can't do it, drink more water, and the fire in your body will go down." Their care made me feel particularly warm.

When I picked up the hammer and chisel, they seemed particularly heavy, but as I was hitting them, I felt it was smoother than yesterday. The tense labor, coupled with the heat from the open hearth furnace behind me, made me sweat all over, and I felt more and more relaxed.

After work, on the way home, I thought that I didn't lie down because I had a cold and a high fever, but instead persisted in working, and after sweating a lot, I actually felt better. The disease was defeated by the enthusiasm for labor, and I was truly happy beyond words.

November 28th

Today is a public holiday. I slept from the time I got off work early in the morning until two o'clock in the afternoon before getting up. Tong'er brought me some letters. After I was approved to work down below, I wrote to my mother and younger siblings to report the good news. Their replies have arrived one after another.

In addition to expressing happiness, my mother's letter especially instructed me to be bold and careful, and to learn well from my master. My younger brother, who works as an engineer in a factory in Shenyang, wrote to congratulate me on becoming a skilled worker with culture or a cadre with practical experience in the near future. My younger sister, who is a doctor in Shanghai, wrote to congratulate me on tempering my will like steel in labor, and hoped that I would tell her about my experience. My younger brother and sister, who are teaching assistants at the Beijing Institute of Technology, also wrote to congratulate me, and said that they had also submitted applications to the organization requesting to be sent to the countryside.

Their letters all made me happy: because everyone can correctly and sincerely support the Party and the country's cadre line, and everyone recognizes that labor is glorious, what a huge force this will generate! In my reply, I wrote: "I must not fail the Party's training and everyone's expectations, and I must conduct training and transformation well in production labor."

November 29th

Today I changed to the early shift.

A large hole collapsed in the ascending flue of the open hearth furnace, and I followed several masters to the top of the swirling roof below the platform to repair it. This place is not only impossible to stand upright in, but also very hot underfoot. The flames from the collapsed bricks shot out very far. We first used long-handled shovels to put bricks on top, but we couldn't put them on several times. Master Zhang picked up two bricks and climbed over, putting his hand into the flames and immediately put a brick in place. His gloves caught fire, he put out the fire next to him, put on his gloves and put another brick in place before climbing back, the sweat on his face dripping like soybeans. Then, Master Liu climbed over and put two bricks in place in the same way. After they laid the foundation, the bricks above were easier to stack. In less than two hours, the hole was completely blocked. The furnace was still making steel as usual, without being affected at all.

This matter is very common for the masters. But when I saw their behavior with my own eyes, I realized even more the greatness of production labor and the selfless labor spirit of the worker comrades. These noble qualities of the working class are truly worthy of my learning and training in production labor.

    下放头五天的日记
    王遂
    编者按：这篇文章很值得一读。作者王遂原来是天津钢厂厂长办公室的秘书主任，以后又当了四个月车间主任，这次下放作修炉瓦工。
    王遂同志在下放参加劳动中，虚心向师傅和工人同志们学习，处处发现劳动人民的优点，时时想到自己的弱点，不只学习生产技能，而且改进思想作风。这股学习的热情，是每一个下放干部决不可少的。
    王遂同志在参加劳动的时候，决心锻炼自己吃苦耐劳的本事，不只咬着牙熬过一般的腰酸腿痛，而且用坚强的意志鞭策着自己，带病坚持劳动，在劳动中战胜了病魔。这股顽强的劲头，也是每一个下放干部决不可少的。
    11月25日
    在天津钢厂厂长办公室工作了几年以后，又到炼钢部作了四个月的车间主任，现在党委批准我下放作修炉瓦工，今天开始参加劳动，上第一个中班。工人同志们今天对我特别亲热，我一进车间他们都围上来问长问短。组长发给我全套工作服，又发给我鎯头和泥铲。三点钟随着何师傅上平炉楼上接班。何师傅砌槽子，我给他提泥搬砖。一块耐火砖约五斤重，我一次搬五块，搬两趟就觉着胳膊酸了。小泥筒提久了也觉着特别沉。看起来我真得好好锻炼一下才行呢。
    休息的时候，我把砖码整齐，把脏土扫成一堆，准备用锨端着倒去。何师傅叫住我说：“别扔，给我。”他爬上煤气道，我一筒一筒地把土递给他，他把土都填在煤气道上。填完以后，他爬下来，告诉我说：“新换的煤气道，砖缝还没有涨严，总冒烟，没有这些土咱们就得买新河沙往上填，用这些脏土去填，既作了地下的清洁又节约了河沙，真是一举两得。咱们当瓦工的就得从这些砖啊土啊上面给国家省钱啦！”这是师傅给我上的第一课。我从前坐在办公室里，是不知道工人同志们就是这样一点一滴地来替国家积累资金的。
    夜间十一点下班，洗过澡，回到家里已经一点多钟了。炉子上热着稀粥，桌上放着煎鸡蛋，碟子下边妻给我留了个字条：“祝贺你光荣劳动的第一天。吃了好好的睡吧”。
    11月26日
    今天是上夜班。晚上十点钟，我才到工厂去。在这冬天的夜里，马路上的一般行人已很稀少。但过了解放桥，情形就大不相同了：到附近棉纺厂去上夜班的女工特别多，有些女工还用婴儿车推着孩子，她们一边走一边说说笑笑。从前不上夜班，我就没有想到过冬天的夜里还会这么热闹。
    今天的工作是在楼下加工修炉用的镁砖。看见别的同志十几钻子就把一块镁砖加工成需要的形状，我拿起鎯头和钻子也照他们的样子作。没想到镁砖是这样硬，我用力打下去只下来一小点，反而把手震的很疼。打了好久还没打好一块砖，打的加工面也高低不平。何师傅告诉我说：“你要顺着一头先打出一条条的沟，再用鎯头把高的地方敲去才行。”我照着他的话试了试果然好的多。真没想到打一块砖也自有学问啊！
    打了一会，砖的样子是差不多了，但远不如别的同志快，我心里就有点发急了，用力过猛，一鎯头就把砖打裂成了两半。这砖是老远从鞍山运来的，价钱很贵，我还没干多少活就砸坏了一块，心里感到十分惭愧。何师傅走过来拿起这块砖看了看说：“你别着急，刚学干活哪能就赶上大家；这块砖原来就有点裂纹，不能完全怪你。”自己出了废品，何师傅这样连批评带安慰的对待我，使我说不出的感动。想起自己过去作领导工作的时候，出了事故不分析原因，也不找教训，就不问青红皂白地向同志们发火，那种作风多么要不得啊！
    夜间三点多钟起了西北风，并且下雪了。何师傅找来一领席在马丁炉旁边围上，对我说：“你经不住冷，到里边去打暖和些。”我让他和别的同志去，他们都不去，并且还告诉我说：“我们搞惯了，不要紧；你是头一回，需要暖和点，快去吧”。
    四点多钟，我和小宁跟着何师傅去砌钢包底。钢包刚浇完钢，虽然凉了一阵，下到里边还和进了蒸笼一样。何师傅进去弯下腰就砌砖，我给递砖递泥。太热，我就把衣服脱了，还是热得难受。但看着何师傅流着满头大汗却一直蹲在那里砌砖，自己也只好忍耐着。何师傅砌完了砖，还把小宁同志砌的地方检查了一遍，补了几个地方。弄好了才爬出钢包。回到休息室的时候，天已经亮了。
    11月27日
    白天昏沉沉地睡了一天，一点东西也不想吃。妻很着急，说：“你准是感冒了，烧得很厉害，又没吃东西，今天请个假，上医院看看去吧。”我心里想：刚参加生产劳动两天就躺下来，这还像话吗？一咬牙就从床上爬起来，强着喝了些水，吃了一碗饭，赶到工厂去上夜班。
    工人同志们看见我神色不对，一摸我全身还在发烧，他们都叫我回家去休息，我说不要紧，干点活出身汗就好了。何师傅见我坚持要干活，就在比较暖和的地方替我摆上砖，还找来几条草袋子铺上，说：“你坐在这儿干吧，干不动就休息休息，多喝点水，身上的火就下去了。”他们的关怀使我感到特别温暖。
    刚拿起鎯头钻子好像特别重，但是打着打着就觉得比昨天更顺手了。紧张的劳动，加上身后马丁炉的热气，使我出了一身大汗，身上也觉得越来越轻松了。
    下班后，在回家的路上，我想到我没有因为患感冒发高烧而躺倒，倒是坚持工作，出了一通大汗反而好得这样快。病魔被劳动热情战胜了，我真有说不出的高兴。
    11月28日
    今天是公休，从早上下班回来就睡，一直睡到下午两点才起床。彤儿拿了几封信来交给我。我在获准下放后曾给母亲和弟弟妹妹们去信报喜，他们的回信都先后来到了。
    母亲的来信除了表示高兴以外，特别嘱咐我要胆大心细，好好跟师傅学习。在沈阳一个工厂里作工程师的弟弟来信，祝贺我在不久的将来成为一个有文化的熟练工人或有实际操作经验的干部。在上海当医生的妹妹来信，祝贺我在劳动中把自己的意志锻炼得像钢铁一样的坚强，并且希望我把自己的体验告诉她。在北京工业学院当助教的弟弟和妹妹也来信表示祝贺，并且说他们也向组织上递了要求下放到农村的申请书。
    他们的来信都使我感到高兴：因为大家都能正确而真诚地拥护党和国家的干部路线，大家都认识到劳动光荣了，这该产生多么巨大的力量啊！我在回信中写道：“我决不能辜负党的培养和大家的期望，一定要在生产劳动中好好地进行锻炼和改造”。
    11月29日
    今天改上早班。
    马丁炉的上升道塌了一个大洞，我跟几个师傅钻到平台下面的旋顶上去修补。这个地方不仅直不起腰，而且非常烫脚。塌砖的地方火焰窜出很远，我们先用长柄铲子往上放砖，但几次都没有放上。张师傅就拿起两块砖爬了过去，把手伸进火焰里一下子就放上了一块砖。手套烧着了，他在旁边弄灭了火，戴上手套又放上了一块砖才爬回来，脸上的汗珠子像黄豆一样往下滴。接着，刘师傅又爬过去照样放上了两块砖。他俩打好了底子，上面的砖就好垒了。不到两个钟头，就把洞完全堵好了。炉子里照常炼着钢，一点也没受影响。
    这件事在师傅们干起来是很平常的。但我亲眼看见他们这种行为，才更加体会到生产劳动的伟大，认识到工人同志们的忘我劳动精神。工人阶级的这些高贵品质，实在是值得我在生产劳动中好好学习和锻炼的。
