To ensure that rectification work is fast and good, Qingdao Municipal People's Committee affiliated units corrected hasty rectification phenomena through re-examination.

    This paper reports that rectification units affiliated with the Qingdao Municipal People's Committee widely organized the masses to conduct re-examinations of rectification efforts, discovering that many units had problems with the quality of already corrected issues and exhibited some superficiality. The Municipal Service Bureau found in its re-examination that 23.13% of the 454 items that had supposedly been rectified were of low quality, and there were also instances of improper rectification. The Municipal Planning Commission originally believed that 73% of the opinions raised by the masses had been addressed, but after re-examination, it was discovered that only 35% had actually been rectified. After re-examining the opinions raised by the masses regarding the leadership's work style at the Municipal Commercial Bureau, it was determined that only 20 items had been genuinely rectified; 37 items were not thoroughly rectified, and 19 items were not rectified at all.

    The problems discovered during the re-examination were roughly divided into five categories. The first category involved handling issues in a general, simple, and perfunctory manner. For example, when the masses criticized wasteful practices, the leadership's response was to "pay attention to frugality"; when the masses criticized the leadership's work style as not being thorough enough, the leadership responded with "the opinion is very good, we will resolutely correct it in the future." The second category involved being fundamentally irresponsible towards the opinions of the masses, dealing with them in a perfunctory way. For example, some simply wrote "for reference," "forwarded for handling," or "handed over to the person concerned for handling" on the masses' opinions, but in reality, they were not referred to or handed over for serious handling; the person concerned was even unaware. The third category involved discussing issues on a case-by-case basis without identifying the root cause of the shortcomings, thus making it impossible to guarantee thorough rectification in the future. The fourth category involved answers that were irrelevant to the question. The fifth category involved handling issues inappropriately or in a fundamentally erroneous way.

    The Qingdao Municipal People's Committee Rectification Leading Group believes that the fundamental reason for the low quality of rectification and the existence of certain superficial phenomena is that many leading cadres still exhibit bureaucratic work styles in the rectification process, have an insufficient understanding of the significance of rectification, and lack determination. To change this situation, starting with the Municipal People's Committee, all rectification units have strengthened leadership, with the top leader personally taking charge; and they have adopted an all-out approach, concentrating all efforts to solve the problems in the rectification process, and launching a high tide of rectification. At the same time, based on the inspection of the previous stage of rectification work, it was proven that the reason why rectification was not done well in the past was largely due to the lack of full mobilization of the masses. Therefore, all units have proposed measures to combine top-down efforts and leadership with the masses. In addition to actively soliciting the opinions of the masses when studying the classification and determining the rectification methods, and submitting them to the masses for discussion, they also held mass symposiums and conducted individual heart-to-heart talks to further solicit the opinions of the masses on the already rectified issues. Some issues that had already been rectified but not announced to the masses were re-announced to the masses; some that the masses were not satisfied with after the announcement were re-examined based on the opinions of the majority of the masses.

    In order to learn from the lessons, many units have also proposed that the leaders who were criticized should directly express their attitude to the masses, rather than having the rectification leading group summarize and answer.

    Since the Qingdao Municipal People's Committee Leading Group and the rectification leading groups of various units conducted inspections separately, each unit has adopted a combination of inspecting and rectifying as they went, and inspecting and rectifying after rectification, according to their different progress, which not only guaranteed the quantity but also guaranteed the quality. As of the 20th of this month, 19,691 items have been rectified.

    保证整改工作又快又好
    青岛市人民委员会所属各单位
    通过复查纠正了整改草率现象
    本报讯　青岛市人民委员会所属整风单位广泛组织群众进行整改复查，发现不少单位在已改了的问题中，存在着质量不高及虚假现象。市服务局在复查中发现已改的四百五十四条中，有23.13％质量不高，还有改的不妥等现象。市计划委员会原认为已改了群众提出的意见总数的73％，经过复查，发现仅改了35％。市商业局群众对领导作风提出的意见，复查后确定真正改的仅二十条；有三十七条改的不彻底，有十九条根本未改。
    复查中发现的问题，大体分为五类。一类是处理的笼统、简单草率。群众批评有浪费现象，领导的答复是“注意节约”；群众批评领导作风不深入，领导答复是：“意见很好，今后坚决改正”。第二类是对群众意见根本不负责，应付搪塞。如有的仅在群众意见上写着“参考”、“转出处理”、“已交有关本人处理”等等，但实际并未参考，也未交有关人认真处理；有关人甚至不知道。第三类是就事论事，没有找出产生缺点的根本原因，因此今后也不可能保证彻底地改。第四类是答非所问。第五类是处理不恰当，或根本错误的。
    青岛市人民委员会整风领导小组认为，造成整改质量不高和存在某些虚假现象的根本原因，是不少领导干部在整改中仍存在着官僚主义作风，对整改的意义认识不足，决心不大。为了改变这种状况，从市人民委员会做起，各整风单位都加强了领导，由第一把手亲自挂帅；并采取了全力以赴的办法，集中一切力量，去解决整改中的问题，掀起整改高潮。同时，根据前一阶段整改工作的检查证明，过去所以改的不好，和没有充分发动群众有着很大关系，因此，各单位都提出了上下结合、领导和群众相结合的措施。这除了在研究分类排队和确定改的办法时积极吸收群众意见，交给群众讨论外，还分别召开了群众座谈会和进行个别谈心，进一步征求了群众对已改问题的意见。有些已经改了，但未向群众公布的问题，又重新向群众进行了公布；有些公布后，群众不满意的，也根据大多数群众的意见，重新作了研究。
    为了接受教训，不少单位还提出了被批评的领导人都应直接向群众表示态度，不应由整风领导小组综合归纳答复。
    自从市人民委员会领导小组和各单位整风领导小组分别检查后，各单位都根据自己的不同进度，采取了随查随改和随改随查相结合的办法，不仅保证了数量，而且也保证了质量。至本月20日统计，已改的问题已达一万九千六百九十一条。
