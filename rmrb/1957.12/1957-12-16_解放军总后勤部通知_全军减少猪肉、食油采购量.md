Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently issued a notice to the entire army, reducing the amount of pork and cooking oil purchased from the market for all types of personnel in the army, with the shortfall to be made up by the troops through self-production. This regulation has been approved by the Ministry of National Defense and will be implemented from January 1, 1958.

The notice stated that in order to implement the State Council's "Regulations on Improving Pork Supply in Cities, Industrial and Mining Areas," so that the pork needed by the national troops does not exceed an average of 1.5 *jin* per person per month, it has been decided that the current pork procurement volume for various types of messes in our army will be reduced by 8 *liang* to 2 *jin* and 11 *liang* per person per month, based on the principle of not reducing for personnel engaged in naval and air duties and troops stationed on plateaus, slightly reducing for hospital convalescent personnel, and significantly reducing for other personnel. Regarding the amount of cooking oil procured, the notice also stipulates that each type of mess will reduce by 2 *liang* to 1 *jin* per person per month.

The notice said that after the amount of military pork and cooking oil procured from the market is reduced, in order to ensure that the troops can still maintain a certain standard of living, each unit should raise more pigs to supplement the reduced procurement portion. For the few units that cannot raise pigs, or those that can raise pigs but still cannot make up for the missing portion, the logistics departments at all levels can make appropriate adjustments from units that raise more pigs.

    解放军总后勤部通知
    全军减少猪肉、食油采购量
    新华社14日讯　中国人民解放军总后勤部日前向全军发出通知，减少军队各种人员猪肉、食油在市场上的采购量，所缺部分由部队生产自给。这项规定已经国防部批准，将从1958年1月1日起执行。
    通知说，为了执行国务院“关于改进城市、工矿区猪肉供应的规定”，使全国部队所需猪肉每人每月平均不超过一点五市斤的标准，决定将我军现行各类灶别的猪肉采购量按担负海、空勤务人员和高原执勤部队不减、医院休养人员少减、其他人员多减的原则，每人每月分别减少八两到二斤十一两。在食油采购量方面，通知中也规定各类灶别每人每月减少二两到一斤。
    通知说，军用猪肉、食油在市场的采购量减少以后，为使部队仍能保持一定生活水平，各部队应多养猪，以补充减少采购的部分。对少数不能养猪的单位，或者虽能养猪仍不能补足缺少部分的单位，各级后勤部门可以从养猪较多的单位适当加以调剂。
