Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: New York Dispatch - Many American newspapers, in commenting on the results of the Paris NATO conference, could not help but admit that although the conference passed some resolutions that threatened peace, the original American plan still suffered significant setbacks. They believe that the United States spent a great deal of effort to achieve a "limited agreement" with its Western European allies on the issue of missiles and missile bases, but these agreements fell far short of the expectations of Eisenhower and Dulles, because Western European countries may still refuse to accept American missiles.

    The "New York Times" complained that the United States paid the price of "changing" its "opposition" to Bulganin's letters to obtain this "limited agreement."

    Frederick, the "New York Post's" Paris correspondent, wrote that Dulles's foreign policy had caused strong dissatisfaction in Paris. In Paris, the calls for negotiations with the Soviet Union are growing louder, and in the end, the United States "may have to admit that negotiating with Russia is, in general, beneficial."

    Frederick went on to say that although the American delegation tried to insist that it had achieved a diplomatic victory at the conference, "in fact, we were severely criticized, and we had to agree to hold negotiations with the Russians, which we had never anticipated before the conference."

    "New York Herald Tribune" commentator Lippmann analyzed the reasons why the American delegation encountered difficulties in Paris. He wrote: "The purpose of the United States at this conference was to unite the Europeans on the basis of two propositions. One is that the United States should equip them with intermediate-range missiles; the other is that they should unhesitatingly abandon the idea of negotiating with Russia... This plan greatly miscalculated the interests and feelings of the Europeans, so it is not surprising that there was such an unexpected lack of trust in American leadership at the meeting."

    Lippmann said that the decline in the prestige of American leadership in NATO is primarily a strategic consequence of the anticipated shift in the balance of power. This shift in the balance of power is unfavorable to the United States because the Russians have surpassed the United States in large rockets, and it is impossible to use the intermediate-range missiles that Dulles suggested giving to the Europeans to make effective changes.

    An editorial in the "New York Herald Tribune" also said that Dulles "suddenly woke up" after attending the NATO conference, "because he found that all Western European countries were not only very uneasy about the United States' backwardness in satellites and missiles. Their unease has reached the point where they are not prepared to agree to the proposal to provide missiles at present."

    Associated Press diplomatic commentator Ryan, in discussing the conference's decision on disarmament, said that this decision is actually "another example of the West's habit of repeatedly parrying" the Soviet Union's initiatives.

    "The Wall Street Journal" said: "Europeans not only abhor war, they also abhor the Cold War." The newspaper said that the situation in NATO has changed, "This change was decided by the European people themselves. Neither the calls of American rhetoricians nor the increase in American aid can turn their weariness into NATO enthusiasm... We do not believe that there is any magic way to revitalize NATO."

    "The Chicago Tribune" said: "The conference certainly did not realize Eisenhower's original hope of revitalizing the alliance. This is practically impossible, as impossible as bringing a dead horse back to life." It also said, "Bulganin's shadow loomed over the entire conference."

    London Dispatch: British newspapers, in commenting on the results of the NATO summit, paid close attention to the fact that the mastermind of this military bloc was unable to pass resolutions that fully conformed to their aggressive plans.

    Prominent Labor figure Foot wrote in the "Daily Herald" that "Compared with the original plan drawn up by the American planners before the meeting, the nature of the meeting has completely or partially changed." Foot affirmed that "Eisenhower and Macmillan's plan failed, and Western Europe, although hesitantly and timidly, rejected America's philosophy of war and peace."

    The "News Chronicle" pointed out that "The contradiction between Europe's tendency to look further in political terms and America's tendency to put on military harnesses runs through the entire discussion at NATO headquarters."

    Berlin Dispatch: The West German "Die Welt" today published a commentary entitled "Failure," commenting on the results of the Paris NATO conference. The commentary said: The goal of the conference was to declare "the unity of the Atlantic countries" to the world, but what was exposed was "disunity." The newspaper pointed out that the failure at this conference was primarily the American policy embodied by US Secretary of State Dulles. This failure is primarily due to its disregard for world public opinion. "Die Welt" said, "The Americans have now seen that there is an independent public opinion in Europe, and this public opinion has already influenced various governments." The newspaper emphasized that NATO member states should be independent and autonomous in deciding on various issues, especially the issue of establishing American rocket bases on their territories.

    The newspaper continued: "Dulles's career has suffered the most serious failure. When Americans are no longer givers but beggars, the European people no longer recognize that the United States can play an absolute leading role in world politics."

    In an editorial published yesterday, the newspaper talked about the attitude of West German Chancellor Adenauer, saying that Adenauer did not announce any major changes in West German policy, nor did he want to cancel the alliance with Western Europe and the United States. "However, the switches have been placed in such a position that the German carriages will no longer be automatically lined up behind the American locomotives." Because the West German head of government believes that relying solely on more weapons and new weapons can no longer deal with the Soviet Union's political offensive. But the American plan is always like this.

    Ottawa Dispatch: Canadian newspapers have pointed out the differences in opinions and interests revealed by the Paris meeting of the NATO Council.

    The Canadian Press correspondent in Paris reported that the "sharp divisions" between the United States and its European allies on the issue of setting up missiles in Western Europe "made the United States helpless."

    Montreal's "The Star" said that Dulles's prestige in Western Europe "has plummeted."

    Peterborough's "Examiner" sharply criticized America's aggressive foreign policy. The newspaper's editorial said, "Canada can no longer support the American policy that has been attacked by the crowd. If the United States does not change its foreign policy, Canada will have to withdraw from this alliance and use any other method, rather than stockpiling nuclear weapons, to stop the rising tide of militarism." The newspaper called for "abandoning the policy of blindly supporting Eisenhower and Dulles's advocacy of establishing rocket bases and stockpiling rocket atomic warheads in Europe," because this policy is "extremely dangerous."

    Dispatches from Paris and comments from local newspapers all emphasized the strong impact that Bulganin's letters had on the participants of the NATO Council meeting and world public opinion.

    西方舆论承认东风压倒西风  美国在巴黎会议上遭到挫折
    本报综合报道  据新华社21日讯：纽约消息，许多美国报纸在评论巴黎北大西洋公约组织会议的结果时不能不承认，会议虽然通过了一些威胁和平的决议，但是美国原先的计划仍然遭到很大挫折。它们认为，美国费了九牛二虎之力才算在导弹和导弹基地问题上取得了西欧盟国“有限的协议”，但是，这些协议远不符合艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯的期望，因为西欧国家仍然有可能拒绝接受美国的导弹。
    “纽约时报”抱怨说，美国用“改变”对布尔加宁信件的“反对态度”的代价才换来了这一点“有限的协议”。
    “纽约邮报”驻巴黎记者弗雷丁写道，杜勒斯的外交政策在巴黎引起了剧烈不满。在巴黎，要求同苏联谈判的呼声日益响亮，到头来，美国“恐怕不得不承认，同俄国谈判这件事，一般说来是有好处的。”
    弗雷丁接着说，虽然美国代表团企图一口咬定，好像它已经在会议上取得了外交上的胜利，但是“事实上我们受到激烈的责骂，我们不得不同意同俄国人举行谈判，这一点是我们会前从未预料到的”。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”评论员李普曼分析了美国代表团在巴黎遇到困难的原因。他写道：“美国对这个会议的目的是要在两个主张的基础上把欧洲人团结起来。一个是美国应该用中程导弹装备他们；另一个是他们应该毫不迟疑地放弃同俄国谈判的思想……这个计划在估计欧洲人的利益和感情问题上是大大地失算了，因此，会上对美国领导如此出人意外地缺乏信任是不足为奇的”。
    李普曼说，北大西洋公约组织中美国领导威信的下降首先是预料中的力量对比关系的改变所产生的战略后果。这种对比关系的改变对美国是不利的，因为俄国人在大型火箭方面超过了美国，想用杜勒斯建议给欧洲人的中程导弹来作有效的改变是不可能的。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”社论也说，杜勒斯参加了北大西洋公约组织会议以后才“猛醒过来”，“因为他发现，西欧一切国家不仅对于美国在卫星和导弹方面的落后感到十分不安。它们的不安已经到了使它们不准备在目前同意接受关于提供导弹的建议的程度。”
    美联社外交评论员瑞安在谈到会议关于裁军问题的决定时说，这个决定实际上是西方对苏联的主动“一再招架的习惯的又一例证”。
    “华尔街日报”说：“欧洲人不仅厌恶战争，他们也厌恶冷战”。这家报纸说，北大西洋公约组织的情况发生了改变，“这种改变是欧洲人民自己决定的。不论是美国雄辩家的呼唤，不论是美援的增加都不能把他们的疲倦变成北大西洋的热情……我们不相信会有什么魔术性的手段能使北大西洋公约组织活跃起来。”
    “芝加哥论坛报”说：“会议当然没有实现艾森豪威尔原定的重新给联盟以活力的希望。这实际上是不可能的，真像要把死马医活一样不可能。”它还说，“布尔加宁的影子笼罩着整个会议”。
    伦敦消息：英国报纸在评论北大西洋集团最高级会议的结果时，非常注意这个军事集团的主谋者没有能通过完全符合他们侵略计划的决议这一事实。
    著名的工党人士福特在“每日先驱报”上写道，“与会前美国策划者拟定的原来计划相比较，会议的性质完全改变了或是部分改变了。”福特肯定说，“艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦的计划遭到了失败，西欧虽然是吞吞吐吐和畏畏缩缩的，但还是拒绝了美国的战争与和平的哲学。”
    “新闻纪事报”指出，“欧洲倾向于政治方面看得远一些，美国倾向于给自己带上军事挽具，这两方面的矛盾贯穿在北大西洋公约组织总部的整个讨论中。”
    柏林消息：西德“世界报”今天以“失败”为题发表了一篇评论，评论巴黎北大西洋集团会议的结果。评论说：会议的目标本来是要向全世界宣告“大西洋国家的团结”而所暴露出来的却是“不团结”。这家报纸指出，在这次会议上遭到失败的，首先是美国国务卿杜勒斯所体现的美国政策。这种失败，首先是由于它不考虑世界的舆论。“世界报”说，“美国人现在已经看到了，在欧洲有一种独立的舆论，这种舆论已经对各国政府发生影响。”报纸着重指出，北大西洋集团成员国在决定各项问题时，首先是在它们的国土上建立美国火箭基地这个问题时，应当是独立自主的。
    报纸继续说：“杜勒斯的事业遭受了最严重的失败。当美国人已经不是施予者而是恳求者的时候，欧洲人民再也不承认美国在世界政治方面可以起绝对的领导作用了。”
    这家报纸在昨天发表的社论里谈到了西德总理阿登纳的态度，它说，阿登纳并没有宣布西德的政策有任何巨大的变化，他也不是要取消同西欧和美国的联盟。“但是，转辙器已经摆在这样的位置上：德国的车厢将不再是自动地排在美国火车头的后面了”。因为西德的政府首脑认为，单是依靠更多的武器和新的武器已经不能对付苏联的政治攻势了。而美国的方案却总是这样的。
    渥太华消息：加拿大报纸纷纷指出北大西洋公约组织理事会巴黎会议所暴露出来的意见和利益的分歧。
    加拿大通讯社驻巴黎记者报道，美国和它的欧洲盟国对在西欧设置导弹的问题上的意见“尖锐分歧”，这“使美国束手无策”。
    蒙特利尔“明星报”说，杜勒斯在西欧的威信“已经一落千丈”。
    彼得堡罗“考察者报”尖锐地批评了美国的侵略性的外交政策。这家报纸的社论说，“加拿大不能再支持已经遭到群起而攻之的美国政策了。如果美国还不改变外交政策，加拿大只得退出这个联盟，并且要用其他任何方法，而不是储备核武器的方法来制止正在高涨的军事浪潮”。报纸要求“放弃盲目支持艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯所主张的在欧洲建立火箭基地和储备火箭的原子弹头的政策”，因为这个政策具有“极大的危险性”。
    巴黎发来的消息和地方报纸的评论都强调指出布尔加宁的信件对北大西洋公约组织理事会会议参加者和世界舆论所产生强烈影响。
