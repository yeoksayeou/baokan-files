Xinhua News Agency, December 6th—To cultivate a red scientific team, the first group of 1,090 cadres from various units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and the headquarters who are being sent down to participate in agricultural labor will begin to depart in batches tonight.

　　More than 80% of these scientific cadres going to the countryside for labor training have a cultural level ranging from senior high school to university graduation; two-thirds are junior researchers and assistant business personnel, and the remaining one-third are scientific administrative cadres. Party members and League members account for nearly half of all cadres being sent down. The cadres being sent down are divided into four large teams and will go to agricultural cooperatives in Jianping, Jingxing, Zanhuang, and Gaocheng counties in the Shijiazhuang Special Zone of Hebei Province to become commune members, some in the plains and some in mountainous rural areas. The Chinese Academy of Sciences had previously sent the Deputy Secretary of the CCP Committee, the Director of the Cadre Bureau, and staff members of the Cadre Bureau to contact and understand the situation from the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP, the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee, and the county committees of the aforementioned counties. The Director of the Cadre Bureau will also escort them to the countryside. In the aforementioned four counties, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has sent a number of cadres with local work experience to do ideological education work for the cadres being sent down.

　　Before departing, the cadres being sent down listened to reports on labor training, current political affairs, and agricultural production tasks for this winter and next spring. The Party organization of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in response to the concerns of some cadres being sent down—business personnel fearing that going to the countryside would delay their work; administrative cadres and assistant business personnel fearing that they would not return after going down—conducted thorough ideological education, making them realize that participating in physical labor in the countryside and transforming their ideology in labor, and firmly establishing a proletarian standpoint is the most fundamental gain. Only with this gain can business rapidly improve, and can better serve socialist construction.

　　Because this group of cadres being sent down has experienced the anti-Rightist struggle and the Party organization conducted profound ideological education work for them before their departure, their morale is very high, and most of them have a correct understanding and attitude towards going to the countryside to participate in physical labor. A young man from the Institute of Literature wrote in his application to go to the countryside: "I have written applications to join the Party several times in the past, but I always feel that I am still far from the standard of a Party member, so I did not have the courage to submit them to the Party organization; this time (when the Party calls on us to go to the countryside) should be the time for me to take action. I am determined to thoroughly transform myself and strive to join the Party." Like him, many cadres being sent down are prepared to strive to become glorious Communist Party members after being tempered in agricultural labor. A young woman from the General Office of the Academy Headquarters cried anxiously when the leadership did not approve her first application to go to the countryside, but she was not discouraged and applied again and again, finally receiving approval. After the parents of a young scientific cadre learned that he was going to the countryside, they sent him a telegram from Shanghai, falsely claiming that he was sick and asking him to return to his home in Shanghai quickly. He immediately publicized this telegram and posted a big-character poster expressing his determination to go to the countryside and not allow his family to obstruct him. However, many parents not only did not hold back but also wrote letters to the leaders of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, expressing their great pleasure in allowing their children to be tempered in agricultural labor. More than 20 cadres from the Institute of Linguistics who were being sent down were assigned to Gaocheng County in the plains to participate in labor. They jointly submitted a report to the leadership, requesting that they be reassigned to more difficult mountainous areas to work. Some cadres being sent down expressed that they would strive to become agricultural labor models before returning.

### 培养红色科学队伍  首都一千多名科学干部下乡去劳动锻炼

　　培养红色科学队伍
    首都一千多名科学干部下乡去劳动锻炼
    新华社6日讯　中国科学院北京各单位和院本部第一批下放参加农业劳动的一千零九十名干部，6日晚开始分批出发。
    这批到农村去劳动锻炼的科学干部中，80％以上具有高中到大学毕业的文化水平；有三分之二是初级研究人员和助理业务人员，其余三分之一是科学行政干部。全体下放干部中党团员占了将近半数。下放干部分成四个大队，分别到河北省石家庄专区的建屏、井陉、赞皇、藁城四个县的农业合作社去当社员，有的在平原农村，有的在山区农村。中国科学院事前曾派了中共党委副书记、干部局局长和干部局
                                      工作人员分头到中共河北省委、石家庄地委和上述各县的县委去联系和了解情况；干部局局长并将送他们下乡。在上述四个县里，中国科学院各派了若干有地方工作经验的干部去做下放干部的思想教育工作。
    下放干部在动身以前，曾经听了有关劳动锻炼、时事政治和今冬明春的农业生产任务等报告，中国科学院党组织针对有些下放干部的顾虑——业务人员怕下乡后耽误了业务；行政干部和助理业务人员怕下去后不再回来，作了充分的思想教育工作，使他们认识到下乡参加体力劳动，在劳动中把思想改造好，站稳无产阶级立场，这是最根本的收获，有了这个收获，才能使业务迅速地提高；才能更好地为社会主义建设服务。
    这批下放干部由于经历过反右派斗争以及在动身前党组织对他们进行了深刻的思想教育工作，所以情绪都很高，对于下乡参加体力劳动的认识和态度大多都是正确的。文学研究所一个青年在他的申请下乡的报告中这样写道：“过去几次写了入党申请书，但总觉得自己距离一个党员的标准还很远，因而没有勇气交给党组织；这次（党号召下乡）应该是我拿出行动来的时候了，我决心彻底改造自己，争取入党。”好些下放干部和他一样，准备在农业劳动中经过锻炼后争取作一个光荣的共产党员。院本部办公厅一个女青年第一次申请下乡时领导上没批准，她急得哭起来了，但她并不灰心，接二连三地申请，终于获得批准。有一个青年科学干部的家长知道他要下乡以后，从上海打了一个电报给他，伪称有病要他速回上海家里去，他立即把这份电报公布出来，同时贴出大字报表示自己决心下乡，决不让家庭阻挠。但是也有不少家长不但不拖后腿，还写信给中国科学院领导人员，表示很高兴让子女到农业劳动中去锻炼。语言研究所二十多个下乡的干部被分配到平原地区的藁城县去参加劳动，他们联名向领导上打了一个报告，要求改派他们到较艰苦的山区去劳动。有些下乡干部表示要争取作了农业劳动模范再回来。
