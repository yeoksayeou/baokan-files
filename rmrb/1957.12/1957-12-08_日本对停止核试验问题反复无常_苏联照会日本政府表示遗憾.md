　　Japan's Inconstancy on the Cessation of Nuclear Tests
　　Soviet Note to Japanese Government Expresses Regret

Xinhua News Agency, December 7th. TASS, Moscow, December 6th: The Soviet government, in a note to the Japanese government on December 5th, expressed regret over the Japanese government and the Japanese delegation attending the 12th United Nations General Assembly taking a consistent stance with Western countries on the issue of ceasing atomic and nuclear weapons tests. The note stated: "Without a doubt, this (Japanese) attitude has had a negative influence on the UN General Assembly adopting a positive decision on this issue."

The Soviet government's note was delivered to the Japanese Foreign Ministry on the 5th by the Soviet Embassy in Japan.

The note stated that the Soviet government has consistently and steadfastly strived for the cessation of all tests of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and believes that in order to immediately resolve this issue, it is necessary to separate the cessation of tests from reaching agreements on other disarmament issues.

The note pointed out that the resolution of the Japanese Diet on the issue of nuclear tests, the speech of the Japanese Foreign Minister during the general debate at the 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly, and the letter from the Japanese Prime Minister to the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on September 24th of this year, all acknowledged the necessity of quickly ceasing the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The Japanese Prime Minister also pointed out in the letter that the cessation of nuclear tests should be realized without having to wait for prior agreements on other disarmament issues. The note stated that the Soviet government welcomed this series of steps taken by Japan aimed at swiftly realizing the cessation of nuclear tests. If the Soviet and Japanese sides could jointly propose such a suggestion, it would promote the rapid resolution of the cessation of nuclear tests in many respects.

The note said that, however, when the general debate on disarmament issues in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly was coming to an end on October 30th, the Japanese representative, in his speech, emphasized that the Japanese proposals stipulated that the cessation of nuclear weapons testing and the cessation of production of fissile materials for military purposes are closely related. This position of Japan is the same as the position of the United States, Britain and France, who firmly oppose the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing. It is well known that the governments of these countries have been trying to achieve their goals in the United Nations through roundabout methods, that is, to entangle the issue of ceasing atomic weapon testing with other disarmament issues, especially with the issue of ceasing the production of fissile materials for military purposes, and these disarmament issues are being hampered by the position taken by these Western countries.

The note said that the Japanese government should know that the issue of ceasing the production of fissile materials for military purposes is an indivisible part of the issue of completely prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons. If no agreement is reached on the complete prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the proposal to cease the production of fissile materials for military purposes will not have any effect on the cause of eliminating the threat of atomic war. On the contrary, this proposal can only worsen the international situation.

The note continued by saying that the purpose of the United States, Britain and France in proposing the cessation of production of fissile materials for military purposes is not at all to make progress in disarmament work. The starting point for them in putting forward such a proposal is that this proposal can hinder the reaching of an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapon testing, and even if this proposal is adopted, it will not affect their plans to use the large amount of fissile materials stored by the United States to produce atomic and hydrogen weapons in the slightest.

From all this, it can be seen that entangling the issue of ceasing atomic and hydrogen weapon testing with other disarmament issues is in line with the Western countries' goal of hindering the reaching of an agreement on the immediate cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing on this issue. However, it is difficult to understand how the attitude taken by the Japanese delegation at the 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly, which is essentially in line with the aforementioned attitude of Western countries, can be reconciled with the Japanese government's statement about hoping to immediately cease nuclear weapon testing.

The Soviet government finally expressed its hope in the note that the Japanese government will consider it possible not to entangle the issue of ceasing atomic and hydrogen weapon testing with other disarmament issues, thereby making it easier for the relevant countries to reach an agreement on the issue of immediately and unconditionally ceasing the testing of these nuclear weapons as the first step towards the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons.

### 日本对停止核试验问题反复无常　苏联照会日本政府表示遗憾

　  日本对停止核试验问题反复无常
　　苏联照会日本政府表示遗憾
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科6日讯：苏联政府在12月5日照会日本政府，对日本政府以及出席第十二届联合国大会的日本代表团在停止试验原子武器和核武器问题上同西方国家采取一致的态度表示遗憾。照会说：“毫无疑问，（日本的）这种态度在使联合国大会对这个问题采取积极的决定上起了不好的影响。”
    苏联政府的这项照会由苏联驻日大使馆在5日递交给日本外务省。
    照会说，苏联政府始终一贯地、坚定不移地争取停止原子武器和氢武器的一切试验，并且认为，为了立即解决这一问题，必须把停止试验同在裁军的其他问题上达成协议分别开来加以解决。
    照会指出，日本国会关于核试验问题的决议、日本外务相在联合国大会第十二届会议进行一般性辩论时的发言以及日本首相在今年9月24日给苏联部长会议主席的信件，都承认必须迅速停止试验原子武器和氢武器。日本首相在信件中还曾经指出，应当实现停止核试验，而不必等到先在裁军方面的其它问题上达成协议。照会说，苏联政府对日本所采取的旨在尽速实现停止核试验的这一系列步骤表示欢迎。假若苏日两国能联合提出这样的建议的话，那么，在许多方面就会促进停止核试验问题的迅速解决。
    照会说，但是，当联合国大会政治委员会上关于裁军问题的一般性辩论在10月30日进入结束阶段的时候，日本代表在发言中强调指出，日本的提案规定，停止试验核武器和停止生产用于军事目的的分裂物质是有密切联系的。日本的这种立场是和美国、英国和法国坚决反对停止试验原子武器和氢武器的立场是相同的。大家知道，这些国家的政府在联合国中想用一些转弯抹角的办法企图达到他们的目的，这就是把停止试验原子武器的问题同另外一些裁军问题特别是同停止生产军用分裂物质的问题纠缠在一起，而这些裁军问题也就是由于这些西方国家所采取的这种立场在作梗而无法达成协议。
    照会说，日本政府应当知道，停止生产军用分裂物质的问题是完全禁止原子武器和氢武器问题的一个不可分割的部分。如果没有在完全禁止原子武器和氢武器问题上达成协议，停止生产军用分裂物质的建议就不会对消除原子战争威胁的事业有任何作用。相反，这种建议只能使国际局势更加恶化。
    照会接着说，美国、英国和法国提出停止生产军用分裂物质的建议，其目的根本不是为了使裁军工作有所进展。他们提出这样的建议的出发点是，这个建议可以阻挠达成停止试验核武器的协议，而且即使这个建议被通过了，也丝毫不会影响他们用美国所储备的大量分裂物质来生产原子武器和氢武器的计划。
    从这一切可以看出，把停止试验原子武器和氢武器的问题同其他裁军问题纠缠在一起，是符合西方国家在这个问题上所要达到的阻挠达成关于立即停止试验原子武器和氢武器的协议的目的的。可是令人很难理解的是，日本代表团在联合国大会第十二届会议所采取的、实质上同西方国家上述态度相吻合的态度怎么能同日本政府关于希望立即停止试验核武器的声明相协调。
    苏联政府在照会中最后表示希望，日本政府将会认为不把停止试验原子武器和氢武器的问题同其他裁军问题纠缠在一起是可能的，从而使各有关国家在把关于立即无条件停止试验这些核武器作为全面禁止核武器的第一步这个问题上易于达成协议。
