    A Mu of Rice Fragrance Travels Ten Li
    The Yixing fragrant japonica rice, famous for its "fragrance", has had another bumper harvest this year. The county planted more than 3,400 mu this year, a tenfold increase over last year. This fragrant japonica rice grows on the edge of Taihu Lake, with large and uniform grains and white rice. Local people describe it as "a mu of rice fragrance travels ten li, one family cooking rice, ten families smell the fragrance." It is said that just adding a small pinch of it when cooking with ordinary rice will make the fragrance overflow to the neighbors.

    一亩稻香飘十里
    以“香”闻名的宜兴香粳稻，今年又获丰收。今年全县种了三千四百多亩，比去年增加十倍。这种香粳稻生在太湖边，粒大而匀，米洁白，当地人们形容它“一亩稻香飘十里，一家煮饭十家香”。据说只要放一小撮和普通米一起煮，就会香溢四邻。
