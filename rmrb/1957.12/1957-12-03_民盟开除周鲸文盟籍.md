Xinhua News Agency, 2nd - The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL) held its 16th expanded meeting this afternoon, discussed and adopted the decision to expel Zhou Jingwen from the League for serious violations of CDL discipline.

The decision stated that Zhou Jingwen had consistently adhered to a reactionary bourgeois stance, harbored hatred for the new China and the new society, and harbored dissatisfaction with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the CDL. During the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements, Zhou Jingwen was exposed by the masses for serious illegal activities, which he has not seriously confessed to date. After China's socialist revolution achieved a basic victory on the economic front in 1956, Zhou Jingwen still refused to accept socialist transformation and opposed taking the socialist road. Around December of last year, Zhou Jingwen went to Hong Kong under the pretext of taking care of family affairs and has been out of contact with the CDL organization for a year. According to reliable reports, Zhou Jingwen has been in close contact with US imperialism and Taiwan's secret service agencies in Hong Kong and the Philippines, engaging in counter-revolutionary conspiracies. In September and October of this year, Zhou Jingwen repeatedly made extremely reactionary remarks to reporters from reactionary newspapers in Hong Kong, falsely claiming that he was sent abroad by the CDL Central Committee for inspection, and viciously slandered China's revolutionary cause, and slandered and cursed the Communist Party and the government.

The decision stated that after the meeting listened to and discussed the serious crimes of Zhou Jingwen exposed and reviewed by the Supervisory Committee of the CDL Central Committee, it unanimously agreed that Zhou Jingwen's criminal acts of opposing the Party and betraying the League overseas seriously violated the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the Charter of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the Charter of the CDL. He has already cut himself off from the people and the CDL.

The decision stated that the Standing Committee of the CDL Central Committee, in order to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves and enforce discipline, unanimously adopted the proposal of the Supervisory Committee and decided to give Zhou Jingwen the punishment of removing all his duties within the League and expelling him from the League.

The decision also suggested to the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference that Zhou Jingwen be removed from his post as a member of the National Committee of the CPPCC.

The meeting was presided over by Shen Junru, Chairman of the CDL. The meeting was attended by Vice Chairmen Shi Liang and Gao Chongmin, Standing Committee members, Central Committee members, and alternate Central Committee members, totaling forty-six people. Liu Qingyang, Xu Shouxuan, Zhou Xinmin, Guo Zechen and other members of the Standing Committee of the CDL and some Central Committee members spoke at the meeting and unanimously agreed to pass the decision to expel Zhou Jingwen from the League.

Zhou Jingwen, a member of the CDL, served as a member of the Standing Committee and Deputy Secretary-General of the CDL Central Committee. He came from a bureaucratic landlord family and joined the CDL during the Anti-Japanese War. After the national liberation, he was elected as a representative to the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and a member of the Second National Committee.

　　民盟开除周鲸文盟籍
    新华社2日讯　中国民主同盟中央常务委员会今天下午举行第十六次扩大会议，讨论并通过了关于周鲸文严重违反民盟盟纪给予开除盟籍处分的决定。
    决定中说，周鲸文一贯坚持反动的资产阶级立场，对新中国新社会有仇恨情绪，对中国共产党和民盟的领导心怀不满。在三反、五反运动中，经群众揭发，周鲸文有严重违法行为，迄未作认真交代。1956年我国社会主义革命在经济战线上取得基本胜利以后，周鲸文仍不接受社会主义改造，反对走社会主义道路。去年12月间，周鲸文托辞料理家务，前往香港，一年来和民盟组织脱离关系。根据确实报道，周鲸文在香港及菲律宾，和美帝国主义及台湾特务机关密切来往，进行反革命的阴谋活动。今年9、10月间，周鲸文一再向香港反动报刊记者发表极端反动的谈话，捏称由民盟中央派他出国考察，并且对我国革命事业进行恶毒的诽谤，对共产党和政府进行诬蔑和诅咒。
    决定说，会议听取和讨论了民盟中央监察委员会揭发并审查了周鲸文的严重罪恶事实以后，一致认为，周鲸文在海外进行反党叛盟的罪恶行为，严重违反中华人民共和国宪法、中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会章程和民盟章程，他已经自绝于人民，自绝于民盟。
    决定说，民盟中央常务委员会为分清敌我，严肃纪律，一致通过监察委员会的建议，并决定给予周鲸文撤销盟内一切职务并开除盟籍的处分。
    决定还向中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会建议，撤销周鲸文的政协全国委员会委员职务。
    会议由民盟主席沈钧儒主持。出席会议的有副主席史良、高崇民，中常委、中委和候补中委等共四十六人。民盟中常委刘清扬、徐寿轩、周新民、郭则沉等和一部分中央委员都在会上发了言，一致赞成通过关于开除周鲸文盟籍的决定。
    周鲸文，民盟盟员，任民盟中央常务委员会委员兼副秘书长，官僚地主家庭出身，抗日战争时期加入民盟，全国解放以后，被选为中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议代表及第二届全国委员会委员。
