    Film Projection Teams Help Peasants Distinguish Right from Wrong
    Xu Chongyi
    Rural film projection teams have played a significant role in assisting the socialist education of peasants by cooperating with the ongoing great debates in rural areas. They selected many films with practical educational significance for mobile screenings and employed various accessible and understandable forms for publicity and explanation, helping peasants distinguish right from wrong and encouraging them to strengthen their confidence and courage in taking the socialist road.
    In the anti-grain hoarding movement in Pinghu County, Zhejiang Province, the First Film Projection Team selected and screened films such as "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "Shajiadian Grain Depot," and "A Collective Farm in the Soviet Union." During the screenings, based on the content of films like "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" and "Shajiadian Grain Depot," they focused on publicizing the arduous fighting spirit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the great significance of the people in the old revolutionary base areas enduring hunger to hand over grain to the state to support the War of Liberation. This powerfully criticized the erroneous ideas of some local people who were hoarding grain. Many people were moved after watching the films, saying, "People in the old liberated areas actively handed over public grain under such difficult conditions. Today, the state purchases grain according to the 'Three Fixes' policy and at reasonable prices. It would be wrong of us to hoard grain and not sell it!" When screening "A Collective Farm in the Soviet Union," the projection team members emphasized the principle that the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow, pointing out the prospects and the path of struggle for socialist cooperativization to the peasant masses.
    Rural film projectionists, through contact with the masses or through meetings, often used these materials to compile publicity materials or create slides to accompany the films. For example, after the First Film Projection Team in Pinghu County visited emancipated peasant Chu Zhengrong, they created a set of slides comparing Chu Zhengrong's old and new lives, accompanied by easy-to-understand rhymes for explanation, allowing peasants to clearly understand the benefits of cooperativization through Chu Zhengrong's situation. For example, after learning that some local peasants believed they were not eating enough grain and that life was too difficult, the projection team in Jurong County, Jiangsu Province, used slides to help peasants calculate three accounts and screened slides of "Is the Ration Standard Too Low?" pointing out that grain should not be wasted and should be used in a planned manner. Because these materials were locally sourced and closely integrated with the local practical situation, they were very touching and greatly enlightening to the peasants.
    In addition to publicity through films and slides, rural film projection teams also used the characteristics of mobile screenings to arrange politically mobilizing slogans around transportation tools such as carts and boats, or hold photo exhibitions at the screening points. The "Think About the Past Suffering, Look at the Present Happiness" photo exhibition held by the First Film Projection Team of Gaoyou County, Jiangsu Province, in rural areas received good results due to its rich and vivid content.

    电影放映队帮助农民辨明是非
    许崇义
    农村电影放映队配合农村中开展的大辩论向农民进行社会主义教育，发挥了很大的作用。他们挑选了许多具有现实教育意义的影片四出巡回放映，运用了多种多样通俗易懂的形式进行宣传解释工作，帮助农民辨明是非，促使农民增强了走社会主义道路的信心和勇气。
    浙江省平湖县第一放映队在配合当地农村反瞒产运动中，选映了“智取华山”、“沙家店粮栈”和“苏联的一个集体农庄”等影片。在映出中，他们根据“智取华山”、“沙家店粮栈”等影片内容，着重宣传了中国人民解放军艰苦的战斗精神，以及老区人民为了支援解放战争，忍饥挨饿把粮食缴给国家的重要意义，有力地批判了当地某些人瞒产积粮的错误想法。许多人看了影片后都很感动地说：“老解放区人民在那样艰苦的情况下，还踊跃交公粮，今天国家根据三定政策，并且订出了合理价格来收购粮食，如果我们还要积粮不卖，那实在太不对了！”在放映“苏联的一个集体农庄”时，放映队员们又着重阐述了苏联的今天就是我们的明天的道理，给农民群众指出了社会主义合作化的远景和奋斗的道路。
    农村电影放映员们在和群众接触中或通过会议了解到情况后，经常应用这些资料编写成宣传材料或绘制成幻灯片，配合影片进行宣传。如平湖县第一放映队访问了翻身农民褚正荣以后，就自画了一套幻灯片将褚正荣的新旧生活作了一番对比，并且配上通俗的顺口溜解说，使得农民通过褚正荣的情况明确地认识到合作化的好处。又如江苏省句容县的放映队了解到当地有些农民认为粮食吃的太少，生活太苦等思想情况后，就利用幻灯片帮农民算了三笔账，又放映了“口粮标准是否低”的幻灯片，指明不要浪费粮食，应该有计划地用粮。因为这些材料都是就地取材，和当地实际情况结合得很紧，很能打动人心，对农民的启发帮助很大。
    除了通过影片、幻灯等进行宣传外，农村电影放映队还利用巡回放映的特点，在交通运输工具如大车、船只等周围布置带有政治鼓动性的标语，或者在放映点举办图片展览会等。江苏省高邮县第一放映队在农村中举办的一套图片展览：“想想过去苦连天，看看现在心里甜”，因为内容丰富生动，收到了很好的效果。
