Xinhua News Agency, 30th Dispatch: According to an Associated Press report from Paris: French Prime Minister Félix Gaillard recently stated during talks with Macmillan in Paris that France is determined to accelerate its own nuclear weapons manufacturing program.

The French government has publicly expressed its opposition to the US-UK plan to monopolize nuclear weapons. Reportedly, senior French officials have told US and UK officials that the US-UK supply of arms to Tunisia has made France "more determined" to pursue its own atomic bomb program. France seeks to conduct a test explosion of a self-made atomic bomb in the Sahara Desert by the end of 1958.
