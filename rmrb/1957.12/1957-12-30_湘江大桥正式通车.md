Xinhua News Agency, Hengyang, 29th -- The Hengyang Xiang River Bridge officially opened to traffic today, three days ahead of schedule. More than 10,000 residents of Hengyang City braved the rain and gathered at the bridgeheads on both sides to hold a ceremony celebrating the completion and opening of the bridge.

The citizens of Hengyang, who had been separated by the Xiang River, came with eager anticipation, supporting the old and leading the young, to celebrate the successful opening of the bridge that they had awaited for many years. Cui Zhangsong, a 52-year-old boatman, was the first to arrive at the bridgehead this morning. This old man, who had poled a sailboat on the Xiang River for more than 30 years and witnessed with his own eyes more than 30 people drowning in a capsized boat due to wind and waves before liberation, said: "This bridge is truly a bridge of happiness. From now on, travel between Jiangxi and Jiangdong will be safe."

The opening ceremony began at 10:00 a.m. The host was Zhang Mengxu, Deputy Governor of Hunan Province. In his speech, he first extended warm congratulations on behalf of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hunan Provincial People's Committee to all the workers who built the bridge. Then, Liu Shenzhi, Director of the Guangzhou Railway Administration, congratulated the completion of the Xiang River Bridge on behalf of the Ministry of Railways, the National Committee of the Railway Workers' Union of China, and all the employees of the Guangzhou Railway Administration. Zhang Mianzhi, Deputy Mayor of Hengyang City, and Ma Zhaoliang, a representative of the bridge construction workers of the Xiang River Bridge, also spoke at the meeting.

At exactly 11:00, Zhang Mengxu cut the ribbon to open the railway bridge. A passenger train from Zhanjiang Port in Guangdong Province to Hengyang passed over the Xiang River amidst cheers and the singing of "On the peaceful land of the motherland." Then, a motorcade of more than 80 vehicles, arranged in two rows side by side, slowly passed over the highway bridge. The people crowded on the sidewalks on both sides of the highway bridge waved bouquets and wreaths to salute the people sitting in the cars.

    湘江大桥正式通车
    据新华社衡阳29日电　今天衡阳湘江大桥较原计划提前三天正式通车。衡阳市一万多居民冒雨欢聚在两岸桥头，举行了大桥落成通车典礼。
    被湘江分开的衡阳市民，以迫不及待的心情，扶老携幼地来庆祝他们期待了多年的大桥胜利通车。五十二岁的船民崔章松今天早上第一个来到桥头。这位在湘江上撑了三十多年帆船、在解放前亲眼看到一次因为风浪翻船淹死三十多个过渡人的老汉说：“这座桥真是幸福桥，今后江西江东来往就安全了。”
    通车典礼上午十时开始。主持人是湖南省副省长张孟旭。他在致词中首先代表中共湖南省委和湖南省人民委员会，向筑桥的全体职工热烈祝贺。接着，广州铁路管理局局长刘慎之代表铁道部、中国铁路工会全国委员会和广州铁路管理局全体职工，祝贺湘江大桥的建成。衡阳市副市长张勉之、湘江大桥建桥工人代表马照亮等，都在会上讲了话。
    十一点正，铁路桥由张孟旭剪彩通车。一列由广东省湛江港开到衡阳的客车，在欢呼声和“在祖国和平的土地上”的歌声中驶过湘江。接着，一支由八十多辆汽车组成的汽车队伍，分两行并排，徐徐地通过公路桥面。拥挤在公路桥两侧人行道上的人们，挥舞着花束、花圈，向坐在车上的人们致敬。
