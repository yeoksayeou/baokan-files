　　How to Care for a Child with Chickenpox
　　Xu Xuzhi Li Qi
　　Chickenpox is a highly contagious acute infectious disease. Winter and early spring are the seasons with the highest incidence. Its pathogen is a filterable virus that can only be seen by special examination methods. This filterable virus usually exists in the patient's skin and the fluid of the pustules, and sometimes also in the patient's blood. Healthy people can be infected through the air or direct contact with the patient's saliva or skin blisters. Children under the age of ten are most susceptible to infection. In some areas where chickenpox has not been prevalent for a long time (such as Tibet), many adults also get sick after being infected. The incidence of chickenpox is so high also because chickenpox can infect people at the end of the incubation period.
　　Symptoms at the Onset
　　After being infected, healthy people will start to get sick after an incubation period of eleven to twenty-three days (averaging fifteen to seventeen days). When the disease occurs, there are the following symptoms: in the prodromal stage of the rash, the patient has low fever, mild weakness, irritability, loss of appetite, mild diarrhea, vomiting, etc. When the rash appears, the patient's body temperature rises, and small red spots appear successively in batches on the hairline of the head, torso, limbs, palms, and soles of the feet. Within a few hours, they turn into papules that are higher than the surface of the skin, and finally become vesicles the size of mung beans containing transparent liquid. There is a circle of redness around the vesicles; after two or three days, the vesicles dry and scab, after six or seven days the body temperature drops to normal, and around fourteen days the scabs fall off from the whole body. Sometimes blisters can also occur on the oral mucosa, pharyngeal mucosa, and conjunctiva, forming small ulcers after breaking.
　　Chickenpox itself is a very mild disease. Only children with malnutrition or other infectious diseases have more severe symptoms when they have chickenpox, sometimes developing pustules, pneumonia, or even sepsis. Therefore, chickenpox patients generally do not need to be hospitalized. They mainly need appropriate care and diet.
　　How to Care
　　Patients should be isolated from healthy children (especially young infants and the weak) as early as possible. If conditions permit, it is best to live in a separate room. The patient must rest in bed and remain quiet. The light in the room should be dim, and attention should be paid to air circulation, but the temperature in the room must be maintained to prevent the patient from catching a cold. Keep the patient's mouth clean and rinse the mouth several times a day with warm water or boric acid solution. Cut your nails short and keep your fingers clean, wear cloth gloves to prevent the blisters from being scratched and causing infection. Pay attention to skin cleanliness, and you can apply 1% gentian violet alcohol solution to the blisters to prevent bacterial infection. When the skin is itchy, you can apply 5% menthol alcohol solution. If skin rashes become infected or pneumonia occurs, you should consult a doctor. The patient's clothes and bedding should be disinfected to prevent infection.
　　Child's Nutrition
　　Since chickenpox is an acute infectious disease, special attention should be paid to nutrition. When giving food, consider the characteristics of the disease, its severity, and stage, as well as the patient's overall condition and responsiveness.
　　During the acute febrile period, the principle is to give the patient food that is nutritious and easy to digest. Diluted milk (mixing milk with 50% rice soup or fruit juice), lean minced chicken porridge (not too thick), finely boiled noodles or pasta with a small amount of lean minced meat and vegetable mince, steamed egg custard, egg drop soup, honey water, lotus root powder, boiled fruit, fresh tangerine juice, red date soup, etc. can be used. Give five or six times a day at regular intervals, each time choosing one of the above-mentioned foods in rotation, in small amounts.
　　When the patient's body temperature drops, the general condition improves, and the appetite increases, the amount of food can be gradually increased appropriately.
　　The diet of patients in the recovery period should contain sufficient mineral salts, vitamins, and a large amount of protein. Foods rich in protein such as milk, eggs, lean meat, fish, tofu, and soy milk can be used. Dishes should be cooked finely and softly, such as minced meat soup, fish soup, braised shredded meat, half-cooked chicken eggs (cooked for three minutes after boiling), steamed chicken egg custard, egg drop soup, braised tofu soup, etc. In addition, fresh fruits (tangerines, apples, grapefruits, bananas) rich in vitamins and mineral salts, especially hawthorn juice and red date soup with more vitamin C, and other fresh vegetables (potatoes, tomatoes, winter melon, carrots, cabbage, etc.) must be made into vegetable puree or minced vegetable soup, vegetable soup, etc., to make them easy to digest. In terms of staple food, you can give porridge, fine noodles, thin pasta, steamed buns, bread, rusks, etc. You can eat four to five meals a day in moderation.

　　怎样护理出水痘的病儿
    徐勖志　李祺
    水痘是一种传染率很高的急性传染病。冬季和初春是发病率最高的时期。它的病原体是一种用特殊方法检查才能见到的滤过性病毒，这种滤过性病毒通常存在于病人皮肤及粉膜疱疹的液体内，有时也存在于病人血中。健康人通过空气或直接接触病人的唾沫、皮肤疱疹后都可以被传染。十岁以下的儿童最容易感染。在某些长期没有水痘流行的地区（如西藏），成年人受传染后得病的也很多。水痘的发病率所以高，还因为水痘在潜伏期末期就可以感染人。
    发病时的症状
    健康人受传染后，经过十一到二十三天（平均十五到十七天）的潜伏期开始发病。发病时有这样一些症状：在出疹前期，病人有低温、轻度软弱、烦躁不安、食欲减退、轻度腹泻、呕吐等。出疹时，病人体温升高，在头部发根处、躯干、四肢、手掌、足蹠等处陆续分批地出现小红斑，数小时内转变成为高出皮肤表面的丘疹，最后成为绿豆大小内含透明液体的水疱，水疱周围有一圈红晕；二、三天后水疱干燥并结痂，六、七天后体温下降到正常，十四天左右全身痂皮脱落。有时口腔、咽喉粘膜、结合膜也可以发生水疱，破后形成小溃疡。
    水痘本身病情很轻，只有营养不良或患其他传染病的儿童患水痘时病情较重，有时发生疱疹化脓、肺炎甚至败血症。因此，水痘病人一般不需住院治疗，主要是给以适当的护理和饮食。
    怎样护理
    病人尽可能应在早期和健康儿童（特别是幼婴儿和衰弱的）隔离开，如条件许可，最好单独住一间房子。病人必须卧床休息，保持安静。室内的光线应较暗，经常注意空气的流通，但需保持室内的温度，不能使病人着凉。保持病人口腔卫生，一天用温开水或硼酸水漱口数次。剪短指甲，并保持手指的清洁，戴上布制手套，以防止疱疹被抓破而引起感染。注意皮肤的清洁，可以用1％龙胆紫酒精溶液涂拭水疱处，以防细菌感染。皮肤发痒时可用5％的薄荷酒精溶液涂拭，遇到皮疹化脓或产生肺炎等情况，应找医生诊疗。病人穿过的衣服、盖过的被褥等需消毒，以防止传染。
    病儿的营养
    由于水痘是急性传染病，要特别注意营养。给饮食时，要考虑疾病的特性、轻重和病期，也需要考虑到病人的全身状态和反应能力。
    在急性发热期，以给病人营养价值高，容易消化的食物为原则。可以采用冲淡的牛奶（以50％的米汤或果汁冲入牛奶中）、瘦鸡肉末稀饭（不能太稠）、煮细挂面或面片加入少量瘦肉末及蔬菜末，蒸蛋羹、蛋花汤、蜂蜜水、藕粉、煮水果、新鲜桔子汁、红枣汤等，一天定时给五、六次，每次可轮流选择上述食物的一种，量宜少。
    当病人体温下降，全身状态好转，食欲增加时，可适当逐渐增加食量。
    恢复期病人的饮食，应该含有足量的矿物盐、维生素及大量蛋白质。可以采用牛奶、鸡蛋、瘦肉类、鱼类、豆腐、豆浆等含蛋白质丰富的食物。菜肴应该烹做得较细软，如肉末羹、鱼羹、烩肉丝、半熟鸡子（煮开后三分钟即成）或蒸鸡子羹、蛋花汤、烩豆腐羹等，另外含维生素及矿物盐较丰富的如新鲜水果（桔子、苹果、柚子、香蕉），特别是含维生素丙较多的红果汁、红枣汤，其他如新鲜蔬菜（土豆、西红柿、冬瓜、胡萝卜、白菜等），必须做成菜泥或菜末羹、蔬菜汤等，使它易于消化。主食方面，可给稀饭、细面条、薄面片、馒头、面包、面包干等。一天可适量进餐四到五次。
