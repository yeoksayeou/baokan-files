Seriously Deal with Bad Elements Among University Students
    *People's Daily* Commentator

    Recently, Beijing universities and colleges exposed a number of bad elements among the students. According to the just demands of the vast number of students, the leadership of many schools has taken different measures to deal with the bad elements based on their specific circumstances. For those with extremely bad natures, the political and legal organs even held mass rallies in the schools to severely punish them according to the law. Such handling has been warmly supported by the broad masses, inspired the enthusiasm of the broad masses to struggle against bad elements, and plays an important role in ensuring the personal and property safety of teachers and students, maintaining normal study and living order, and purifying the ranks of university students.

    Since liberation, although political and legal organs and school administrations have continuously cracked down on bad elements in schools, some comrades have an unclear understanding of the nature and harm of hooligans and thieves, and they do not recognize the importance of safeguarding national law and school discipline. Therefore, their handling of them is often too lenient, the crackdown is not forceful, and prevention is not strict. Some people commit crimes repeatedly, but are perfunctorily "educated and released," so they still wear school badges and "freely" enter and exit dormitories and classrooms to carry out criminal activities. Some are not dealt with for two or three years. This is actually "tolerating evil," condoning bad elements to commit further crimes, making them more daring and unscrupulous. In many schools, theft and hooligan activities of insulting women are quite rampant. These bad elements' criminal activities seriously disrupt the normal study and living order of the school and threaten the personal and property safety of the broad masses of teachers and students. Like the bad elements in society, they are no longer a matter of internal contradictions among the people. Chairman Mao said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "In order to maintain social order and the interests of the broad masses of people, it is also necessary to exercise dictatorship over those thieves, swindlers, murderers, arsonists, hooligan gangs, and various bad elements who seriously disrupt social order." Therefore, we cannot be tolerant of the dregs among university students without principle. We must severely crack down on them and resolutely remove those bad elements with serious crimes and egregious circumstances from the ranks of university students.

    In the past, some people one-sidedly emphasized that university students are young and naive, and advocated lenient treatment of bad elements among students. Indeed, general students are younger and more naive, but this is only in comparison with adults. In fact, there are also some people with rather complex political thoughts among university students. Taking bad elements as an example, according to the exposed situations, 80% to 90% of bad elements come from families of the exploiting classes. They have long lived a decadent life of the exploiting class, and the exploiting class's ideas of harming others for self-interest and indulging in ease and comfort occupy their souls and permeate their bodies. Some became hooligans and habitual thieves in middle school; some have declining family economic conditions, and in order to satisfy their exploiting-class "enjoyment" life, they do not hesitate to destroy national laws and the interests of the people, degenerate into crime, and cannot extricate themselves; others harbor resentment against the revolution and deliberately carry out political sabotage activities. The criminal activities of these bad elements seriously affect the normal learning order of the school and have great economic and political harm. Some criminal activities are very egregious. They are neither naive nor are their crimes smaller than those of bad elements in society. In order to safeguard national law, strictly enforce school discipline, purify the ranks of university students, and reduce the corrosive effect of bad elements on university students with weak will, shouldn't we, like dealing with bad elements in society, relentlessly and severely crack down on bad elements among university students? Can we allow these bad elements to continue to tarnish the honor of socialist university students?

    Some people also say: "We should focus more on educating bad elements among students, and expulsion and arrest will ruin their future." This opinion is wrong. We should exercise dictatorship over those who have become bad elements. In the past, some schools blindly adopted the method of persuasion and education for bad elements, but this good intention could not move them. They said: "Anyway, they can't do anything to me," and still rushed to the "future" of capitalism, engaging in criminal activities more unscrupulously. Therefore, we should learn from the past and severely crack down on bad elements and deal with them seriously. Those who should be expelled should be expelled, and those who should be arrested and brought to justice should be arrested and brought to justice, and they should be forced to reform themselves through labor. Only in this way can they change their minds, dare not continue to do bad things in the new society, lower their heads, learn to work, learn to do something good for the collective, start anew, and embark on the road of socialism. This is the best education for bad elements.

    On the one hand, we must sanction bad elements among university students, and on the other hand, we must find ways to block their opportunities to carry out criminal activities. According to the current exposure, most hooligans and thieves are active in public places and dormitories. Some thieves said: "The school is big, there are many things, no one cares, and it is easy to steal." This is the bad element teaching us a lesson, telling us that we must earnestly improve our work. Administrative departments should establish necessary management systems and resolutely implement them; students should be educated to improve their vigilance and overcome complacency. In this way, on the one hand, we can build a copper wall and iron wall in the school to prevent the activities of bad elements, not giving them an opportunity to take advantage of; at the same time, we can cast a net to capture all bad elements, so that they have no place to hide, in order to consolidate the order of socialist universities and purify the ranks of university students.

    The purging of a group of bad elements among university students is a major victory in the "rectification" of universities and colleges. In the future, we should continue to adhere to the struggle against bad elements, and strengthen the political and ideological education of university students, so as to eliminate the emergence of new bad elements as much as possible. To this end, party and league organizations and administrative leaders of various schools should combine socialist education and vigorously criticize the selfish and self-interested exploiting class ideology existing among students. Through the handling of typical cases, expose the harm of exploiting class ideology to young people, promote a style of hard work and thrift, and establish communist moral qualities, in order to help the broad masses of students resist the erosion of exploiting class ideology and save those who are close to the brink of crime. At the same time, we must also strengthen legal education for university students, so that every university student understands that consciously abiding by national laws is the glorious obligation of every citizen, and consciously abiding by school discipline is a necessary condition for every socialist university student. Students should supervise each other, and resolutely struggle against those students who violate laws and discipline, and maintain social order and school discipline.

　　严肃处理大学生中的坏分子
    本报评论员
    最近，北京高等学校揭发了一批学生中的坏分子。根据广大学生的正义要求，许多学校领导方面已经按照不同情况对坏分子分别进行了处理，对其中性质极端恶劣的，政法机关还在学校中举行了群众大会，依法严惩。这样的处理获得了广大群众的热烈拥护，启发了广大群众对坏分子进行斗争的积极性，对保障学校师生人身和财物的安全，维护正常的学习和生活秩序，纯洁大学生的队伍都有重要的作用。
    解放以来，政法机关和各校行政虽然对学校中的坏分子不断进行打击，但是，由于有些同志对流氓、盗窃分子的性质及其危害性认识不清，对维护国法和学校纪律的重要性认识不够，因而对他们的处理往往失之过宽，打击不力，防范不严。有的人犯罪多次，都马马虎虎地“教育释放”，所以他们依然戴着校徽，“自由”出入宿舍、教室，进行犯罪活动。有的拖延二、三年也不加以处理。这实际上是“姑息养奸”，纵容了坏分子进一步犯罪，使他们更加胆大妄为，肆无忌惮。许多学校中偷窃和侮辱妇女的流氓活动相当猖獗。这些坏分子的犯罪活动严重地破坏了学校正常的学习和生活秩序，威胁着广大师生人身和财产的安全，他们和社会上的坏分子一样，已经不是什么人民内部的问题了。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中说：“为了维护社会秩序和广大人民的利益，对于那些盗窃犯、诈骗犯、杀人放火犯、流氓集团和各种严重破坏社会秩序的坏分子，也必须实行专政”。因此，我们对于大学生中的败类，不能无原则地宽容，必须狠狠地打击，坚决把那些罪恶严重、情节恶劣的坏分子从大学生的队伍中清除出去。
    过去有些人片面强调大学生年轻、幼稚，主张对学生中的坏分子从宽处理。的确，一般学生是年轻、幼稚一些，但这只是和成年人比较而言，实际上大学生中也有一部分政治思想相当复杂的人。就拿坏分子来说，根据已经揭发的情况，坏分子中80％至90％出身于剥削阶级的家庭，他们长期过着剥削阶级腐朽糜烂的生活，剥削阶级损人利己、好逸恶劳的思想占据了他们的灵魂，浸透了他们的机体。有的在中学时就成了流氓、惯窃；有的家庭经济生活下降，因满足不了他们剥削阶级“享乐”的生活，竟不惜破坏国家的法律和人民利益，堕落犯罪，不能自拔；有的则因对革命怀恨在心，蓄意进行政治性的破坏活动。这些坏分子的犯罪活动严重影响了学校正常的学习秩序，经济上、政治上都有极大的危害，有的犯罪活动是非常恶劣的，他们既不幼稚，也不比社会上坏分子的罪恶小些。我们为了维护国法，严肃校纪，纯洁大学生的队伍，减少坏分子对意志薄弱的大学生的腐蚀作用，难道不应该像对待社会上的坏分子一样，毫不留情地，狠狠地打击大学生中的坏分子吗？难道能够容许这些坏分子继续玷辱社会主义大学生的荣誉吗？
    还有些人说：“对学生中的坏分子，应该更着重于教育，开除学籍、逮捕法办就断送了他们的前途”。这个意见是不对的，我们对于已经成为坏分子的人，就应该对他们实行专政。过去有些学校对坏分子一味采取说服教育的办法，而这种善良的愿望感动不了他们。他们说：“反正也不能把我怎么样”，依然奔向资本主义的“前途”，更加肆无忌惮地进行犯罪活动。因此，我们应该吸取教训，对坏分子要狠狠地打击，严肃地处理，该开除的开除，该逮捕法办的逮捕法办，并且强制他们在劳动中改造自己。只有这样，他们才可能回心转意，不敢继续在新社会里干坏事情，低下头来，学会劳动，学习为集体作点好事情，重新做人，走上社会主义的道路。这是对坏分子最好的教育。
    对大学生中的坏分子，一方面要加以制裁，另一方面还要想办法堵塞他们进行犯罪活动的机会。根据目前揭发的情况，绝大多数流氓、盗窃分子都是在公共场所、宿舍中进行活动的。有的盗窃犯说：“学校地方大，东西多，没人管，好偷”。这是坏分子给我们在上课，告诉我们必须切实改进工作。行政事务部门应该建立必要的管理制度，并且坚决贯彻执行；对学生要教育他们提高警惕性，克服麻痹思想。这样一方面可以在学校里筑起一道防范坏分子活动的铜墙铁壁，不给他们可乘之机；同时撒下一个捕捉一切坏分子的天罗地网，使他们没有藏身之处，以巩固社会主义大学的秩序，纯洁大学生的队伍。
    清洗了一批大学生中的坏分子，这是高等学校“整改”中一项重大的胜利。今后应该继续坚持和坏分子作斗争，并且加强对大学生的政治思想教育工作，以尽量杜绝产生新的坏分子。为此，各校党、团组织和行政领导应该结合社会主义教育，大力批判学生中存在的自私自利的剥削阶级思想，通过典型案件的处理，揭露剥削阶级思想对青年的危害性，提倡艰苦朴素、克勤克俭的风气，树立共产主义道德品质，以帮助广大学生抵制剥削阶级思想的侵蚀，挽救那些走近犯罪边缘的人。同时，还要加强对大学生进行法制教育，使每一个大学生都懂得：自觉地遵守国家法律是每一个公民的光荣义务，自觉地遵守学校纪律是每一个社会主义大学生必须具备的条件。同学间应该互相监督，对于那些违法乱纪的学生应该坚决地斗争，维护社会秩序和学校纪律。
