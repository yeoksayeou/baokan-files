　　It's Not Surprising That Wang Han is a Rightist
　　Zheng Shaowen
    During the anti-Rightist struggle, the Ministry of Supervision exposed Wang Han, the Executive Vice Minister and Deputy Secretary of the Party Group of the ministry, as a Rightist element hidden within the Party. Those who don't know Wang Han's background might have this question: why would a senior cadre and veteran Party member like Wang Han degenerate into a Rightist? This is not difficult to understand if you look at Wang Han's past, and therefore it will not be surprising.
    I have known Wang Han for nineteen years. Nineteen years ago, he was the head of the Ebei Party Committee, and I was working in Ebei at the time. Later, we worked together in the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army. After liberation, he and I worked in the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee and the Central and Southern Administrative Committee. In these nineteen years, as far as I know, the Party has always valued Wang Han, and patiently helped him correct his mistakes when they were discovered. However, Wang Han insisted on the standpoint of bourgeois individualism, not only refusing to reform himself, but also consistently expressing dissatisfaction with the Party, always believing that the Party did not value him enough or trust him enough. He was never satisfied with his job position, work environment, or leaders, whether in the Fifth Division, in Central and Southern China, or in the Central Ministry of Supervision. What was the reason for his dissatisfaction? Wang Han once told me that he was always a man of his word, and only he criticized others, and no one ever criticized him. From this, it is not difficult to see how arrogant Wang Han was! He thought he was only fit to be a leader, not to be led. In his view, with his talent and past work achievements, the Party should have given him a higher position. He often said that his old classmate so-and-so had become a member of the Central Committee, and that some of his old subordinates had become something or other, implying that he was somewhat "underqualified" as a deputy. What were the facts?
    In 1939, Wang Han served as the secretary of the Ebei Party Committee. During his time in Ebei, he made serious mistakes. He violated the organizational principles of the underground party, registered Party members within the Ebei Party, and later, due to his mistake, the registration forms of these Party members, along with top-secret documents from the Central Committee, were lost to Kuomintang agents. Logically, after the incident, cadres should have been quickly organized to evacuate, and those cadres who had been discovered by the enemy should have been evacuated to a safe place to avoid possible sabotage and losses. However, Wang Han did not do this, which led to a major destruction of the Ebei Party, and many comrades were imprisoned and killed as a result, while he simply left. Regardless of the reasons for this major destruction of the Ebei Party, Wang Han, as the secretary of the Party Committee, bore serious political and organizational responsibility. However, Wang Han not only did not feel remorse about this matter, but never admitted that he had made any mistakes, nor did he make any self-criticism in any meeting or private conversation. When the Party and comrades raised this issue, he expressed extreme dissatisfaction. This shows that Wang Han had long lost the qualities that a communist party member should have and the minimum sense of responsibility for the cause of the Party.
    In early 1940, Wang Han arrived at the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army, serving as the deputy director of the political department of the Fifth Division. Wang Han worked in the Fifth Division for about three and a half years, and he became burdened with the idea that he had created the political work of the Fifth Division. He often said: The political work of the Fifth Division was done well, and he personally had great achievements. What was the actual situation? Without a doubt, the political work of the Fifth Division had achievements, but this came from the leadership of the Party, the support of the broad masses, and the joint efforts of all Party members and soldiers, not from Wang Han's personal talent. Wang Han did some work in the political department of the Fifth Division, but he also made some serious errors in principle.
    During the period when Wang Han worked in the political department of the Fifth Division, he consistently advocated and emphasized the independence of the army's political work system, not only organizationally but also politically. In his view, the political department of the Fifth Division should only be led by the General Political Department or the military political department, and should not be led by the Eyu District Party Committee. This was essentially asking the Party for independence and opposing the Party's leadership. Wang Han also tried his best to expand his personal power. According to the traditional customs of the People's Army and the regulations on army political work, the heads of army political work can only countersign political orders, but Wang Han formally proposed that he should countersign military orders, attempting to gain the power to command the troops. This arrogant demand was naturally unattainable.
    Precisely because Wang Han had serious personal ambitions, he did not pay attention to the Party's work in the army, which is the fundamental issue of army political work, in the political work of the Fifth Division. He neither regarded the work of the company branch as the center of political work, nor did he attach importance to carrying out systematic Party propaganda and education work in the army to strengthen and consolidate the Party's leadership over the army. He was only satisfied with the general activities of the political organs, which looked lively on the surface but were actually empty. This formalism was also reflected in the political education of the troops. Wang Han's guiding ideology for the political education of the troops was not based on the needs of the war environment and the actual thoughts of the soldiers and masses. Under his guidance, the "Political One Hundred Lessons" compiled and distributed by the division's political department was a clear example. This textbook was designated as a textbook for the political education of the soldiers in the company, and its content was a concise outline of modern Chinese history from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution to the War of Resistance Against Japan. It was fundamentally not in line with the reality of the troops, and not only could the soldiers not understand it, but no company instructor could teach it.
    Wang Han also did not attach importance to the political work principle that the People's Army under the leadership of the Party is both a fighting force and a working force. He did not understand that the army should also help the local areas with mass work, nor did he regard continuously improving the relationship between the army and the people as a regular task of army political work. Although the division's political department had also issued instructions on supporting the government and cherishing the people, in Wang Han's view, this was just a routine article for festivals. Wang Han also paid very little attention to the fact that army political work should guarantee the wartime logistics work. In his view, mobilizing civilian porters, collecting grain and fodder, and rescuing and transporting the wounded were only the responsibility of the local government and the headquarters. Whenever there were problems in these areas, he either blamed the local government or the division headquarters and the division health department, rarely checking the shortcomings and responsibilities of political work.
    The most prominent thing is that during his work in the Fifth Division, Wang Han resisted the organizational line of taking Red Army cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds as the backbone of army building. At that time, the Fifth Division was a newly formed army. If it did not rely on Red Army cadres who had been tested by war and had rich military experience as the backbone, it would obviously be impossible to maintain the fine traditions of the People's Army and the Party's absolute leadership over the army, and it would be impossible to successfully persist in the arduous guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. Therefore, relying on Red Army cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds as the backbone of the Fifth Division was a matter of the Party spirit of the troops, and a matter of the victory or failure of the Fifth Division. This fundamental issue should have been the basis of the Fifth Division's political work, but Wang Han was not like this. He did not have political feelings for these old comrades, he looked down on them in his work, and even had prejudices against them, always being incompatible with them, and not getting along with them. This was something that everyone in the Fifth Division knew. Wang Han did not see that our old cadres came from the working people and had rich feelings and flesh-and-blood ties with the people; they possessed the fundamental fine qualities of being loyal to the Party and loyal to the cause of the people's revolution. This proves that Wang Han lacked the proletarian standpoint and class feelings for the working people.
    In order to achieve the goal of excluding worker and peasant cadres from army political work, he openly advocated that the company instructors should be intellectual cadres. Of course, we do not oppose the idea that there should be, and must be, a group of intellectual cadres in the army's political work who are loyal to the proletarian cause. Facts have proved that intellectual cadres have always been trusted and valued in the work of the Fifth Division. Under the leadership of the Party, they are united with the old cadres and have made no small contribution to the cause of the Party. However, in terms of the situation of intellectual cadres at that time, most of them still lacked the necessary ideological transformation. They still had many non-proletarian thoughts, viewpoints, and a lack of firm proletarian standpoint, and they also lacked war experience and necessary work experience. Therefore, attention should be paid to helping them obtain the necessary education and transformation in practical work. However, Wang Han looked at this issue from the standpoint of bourgeois intellectuals. He said: Worker and peasant cadres only run around, and their work is not as in-depth as that of intellectual cadres. Worker and peasant cadres can only list the phenomena of problems, but cannot summarize problems and cannot discover the essence of problems, so they cannot be regarded as in-depth. Not only that, Wang Han also attempted to distort the Central Committee's rectification policy in 1942 with ulterior motives. As everyone knows, the main focus of the 1942 rectification movement was to overcome dogmatism within the Party, but Wang Han said that the problem of the Fifth Division was not dogmatism but empiricism. He said: In terms of the actual situation of the work of the Fifth Division, it is not that there is too much dogmatism, but that there is too little dogmatism. The intention of his saying this is not difficult to understand. He was attempting to direct the focus of the Fifth Division's troop rectification movement towards opposing empiricism, in order to oppose Red Army cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds. It was precisely because of the leadership of the Party that Wang Han's anti-Party erroneous thoughts and propositions were criticized and resisted as they should have been, so they were not spread. Otherwise, it would have brought serious consequences to the work of the Fifth Division.
    Wang Han also viewed local work with an extremely serious right-leaning opportunist viewpoint. He believed that the only task of local work was to support the army and serve the army. He said: Military first, victory first, should be the central task of local work; having political power but not knowing how to raise troops and money is like getting married but not knowing how to sleep with your wife. This kind of thinking is a reflection of the militarism of the exploiting classes. Under the historical conditions at that time, we did not object to emphasizing the importance of the army, but Wang Han's purpose was to obtain the power to command the local Party, so as to achieve his personal goals. The erroneous slogan of "military first, victory first" had the bad consequences of worsening the relationship between the army and the people and promoting the coercive command style of local work. Wang Han's extremely alienated from the masses and anti-mass exploiting class thinking was also reflected in his lifestyle. Instead of sharing weal and woe with the masses, he was very particular about comfort and ease. Even in order to make his house have enough light and air, he did not hesitate to break the walls of the common people. When he was recuperating in the Fifth Division, the organization had already given him many considerations, and he had also spent a lot of money, which could barely be justified because he was sick. However, he was so particular that he disregarded the difficulties and hardships of our main forces at that time, who often did not have money for vegetables and straw sandals, and even could not eat three meals a day, and squandered money arbitrarily. In order to relieve his boredom, he did not care whether the work was affected or not, and specially transferred two cadres to accompany him to talk about the past and the present. In order to have a quiet recuperation environment, he drove out the owner of the house, killed the chickens and dogs in the village, and even forbade the troops stationed near him to sound the horns in the morning and evening, which aroused the indignation of the masses and comrades.
    From this, it can be seen that Wang Han did not have any remarkable achievements during his work in the political department of the Fifth Division. On the contrary, due to his erroneous thoughts and measures of the exploiting classes, he brought a lot of harm to the work. Wang Han should have adopted a humble and self-reflective attitude towards the serious mistakes he had made, in order to overcome his shortcomings and correct his mistakes. However, he refused criticism and persisted in his mistakes. In his view, all the correct criticisms from all sides were malicious attacks, and all the reasonable resistance from below was the result of the Party committee directly interfering too much in political work, not letting go, not trusting him, and not supporting him. Therefore, not only did he not correct his mistakes, but instead he complained passively, saying that the work of the division's political department was difficult! It's not easy to do! He asked to change his job! In fact, he harbored a deep dissatisfaction with the leadership of the district Party committee and the division. He openly spread his dissatisfaction to the people below.
    Emphasizing the independence of national supervision work, attempting to make national supervision work separate from the leadership of the Party, and even attempting to place national supervision work above the Party and the government, has been Wang Han's consistent position. When he worked in the Central and Southern Supervision Committee, he refused to attend the meetings of the Central and Southern Political and Legal Committee. He believed that the Central and Southern Supervision Committee was under the leadership of the Central Supervision Committee, and should not accept the leadership of the Central and Southern Party and government organs. He once said: The Party manages too much and the supervisory organs should be allowed to form a system of their own and lead vertically. It is not difficult to see that Wang Han's emphasis on the independence of supervision work is not for anything else, but to fight for leadership with the Party, to oppose the leadership of the Party, in order to satisfy his personal ambitions.
    Wang Han lacked the due class love and comradely concern for cadres, especially cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds. When problems arose in his work, he always blamed others and never examined himself, even making sarcastic remarks and ridiculing others. When he encountered different opinions in his work, he did not discuss them openly, but agreed in person and opposed them behind his back. He did not criticize the shortcomings and mistakes of his comrades in person, but secretly reported them, gloating over their misfortunes. He was not happy to see that other comrades' work was better than his. In 1944, Wang Han was transferred away from the political department of the Fifth Division due to illness. He did not take a helping attitude towards the comrades who succeeded him, but spoke ill of this comrade in front of some cadres of the political department of the division, so that this comrade could not carry out his work smoothly. At this time, he pretended to be nonchalant and watched the jokes of others from the sidelines.
    From the above facts, it can be seen that Wang Han's degeneration into a Rightist was by no means accidental. Although he joined the Party when he was studying in college and has been in the Party for twenty-five years, he has never been willing to seriously transform the exploiting class's standpoint, thoughts, and viewpoints that he brought from his landlord family and the bourgeois education he received. After joining the Party, he has been working in leading organs, and has neither been trained through mass movements and grassroots work, nor has he been trained through strict organizational life. He has no feelings for the working people and never thinks about the interests of the people, but seeks personal power everywhere. He has extremely serious individualism and personal ambition, and has consistently asked the Party for power and influence. No matter which department he works in, he wants to place the power of this department above other departments, and everything must be at his command. Otherwise, he is either passive or shouts that the work is difficult. He has consistently refused self-transformation, refused the Party's education and the criticism of comrades, persisted in his mistakes, and despised the masses. He always wants to place the individual above the Party organization and is unwilling to obey the leadership of the Party organization. According to the materials revealed by the Ministry of Supervision, Wang Han has not only not overcome the above-mentioned mistakes in recent years, but has also greatly developed them. Therefore, at the juncture of the socialist revolution, he has increasingly degenerated and embarked on a thorough anti-Party road. This is an inevitable result. Therefore, I am not surprised that Wang Han is a Rightist. On the contrary, I believe that exposing him now is a major victory for the Party's rectification movement.

　　王翰是个右派分子并不奇怪
　　郑绍文
    监察部在反右派斗争中，揭露出该部常务副部长、党组副书记王翰是一个暗藏在党内的右派分子。不知道王翰底细的人或许会有这样的疑问，像王翰这样的高级干部和老党员，为什么也会堕落成为右派分子呢？这只要看一看王翰的过去就不难理解这个问题了，因而也就不会有什么奇怪的了。
    我认识王翰有十九年了。十九年前，他是鄂北党委的负责人，当时我也在鄂北工作。后来，我们又共同在新四军第五师工作。解放后，我和他又同在中南军政委员会及中南行政委员会工作过。在这十九年间，就我所知，党对王翰一直是器重的，在发现他有错误以后，就耐心地帮助他改正错误。可是王翰却坚持资产阶级个人主义的立场，不但拒绝改造自己，而且对党一直表示不满，总认为党对他器重不够，信任不够。他对工作职位，工作环境和领导人，从来没有满意过，在五师如此，在中南如此，在中央监察部也是如此。不满意的原因在哪里呢？王翰曾对我说他从来是说了就算的人，只有他批评人家，从没有人家批评过他。从此不难看到，王翰狂妄到何等的程度！他以为自己是只能作领导者，而不能作被领导者的。在他看来，以他的才能和已往的工作成就，党应该给予他更高职位。他常说他的老同学某某人已作了中央委员，他的老部下某些人已作了什么什么，言下之意，他现在还当这个副职是有些“屈才”的了，事实是怎样的呢？
    1939年王翰担任鄂北党委书记，他在鄂北工作期间，曾经犯过重大错误，他违反了地下党的组织工作原则，在鄂北党内进行党员登记，后来又由于他的错误，把这些党员登记表连同中央的绝密文件一起失落到国民党的特务手里。照理说，在事情发生之后，就应该迅速地组织干部撤退，把那些已经被敌人发现了的干部撤退到安全的地方，以避免可能发生的破坏与损失，但是王翰并没有这样做，终至造成鄂北党的大破坏，不少同志因此被囚被杀，他则一走了事。这次鄂北党的大破坏，不管其原因如何，作为党委书记的王翰是负有严重的政治责任和组织责任的。可是王翰对这件事，不但不感到沉痛，并且还从不认为他有什么过错，也没有在任何会议和私人谈话中有过片言只语的检讨。当党和同志们提出这个问题的时候，他反而表示极度的不满。这说明王翰是早已失去了一个共产党员应有的品质和对党的事业的起码责任感的。
    1940年初王翰到了新四军第五师，担任五师政治部的副主任。王翰在五师做了大约三年半的工作，他就背上了创立五师政治工作的包袱。他常讲：五师政治工作是做得不坏的，他个人如何如何的有功绩。实际究竟如何呢？毫无问题，五师政治工作是有成绩的，但这是来自党的领导，来自广大群众的拥护和全党全军同志的共同努力，并不是来自王翰个人的才能。王翰在五师政治部是作了一些工作，但也犯了一些严重的原则错误。
    王翰在五师政治部工作的时期，一直主张和强调军队政治工作系统的独立性，不但组织上要独立，而且政治上也要独立。在他看来，五师政治部只能受总政治部或军政治部的领导，而不应该受鄂豫区党委的领导，这实质上是向党要独立和反对党的领导。王翰还竭力企图扩大他个人的权势。按照人民军队的传统习惯和军队政治工作条例的规定，军队政治工作首长只能在政治命令上附署，可是王翰却正式提出他要在军事命令上附署，企图取得指挥部队的权力。这种狂妄的要求，自然是不能达到的。
    正因为王翰具有严重的个人野心，所以王翰在五师政治工作中不重视部队党的工作这一军队政治工作的根本问题。他既没有把连队支部工作看作是政治工作的中心，也不重视在部队中有系统的进行党的宣传教育工作，加强和巩固党对部队的领导。他只满足于政治机关的一般活动，从表面上看是轰轰烈烈，实际上是空空洞洞。这种形式主义的错误，还表现在部队的政治教育上。王翰对部队政治教育的指导思想，不是根据战争环境的需要和战士群众的思想实际出发，在他指导之下，由师政治部编发的“政治一百课”，就是一个明显的例证。这个课本被指明是连队战士政治教育的课本，它的内容则是上自太平天国革命，下至抗日战争的一个中国近代史的简明提纲，根本不切合部队的实际，不但战士听不懂，也没有那一个连指导员讲得下去。
    王翰对在党领导下的人民军队，既是战斗队又是工作队这一政治工作原则，也是不重视的，他不懂得军队还应该帮助地方作群众工作，也没有把继续不断改善军民关系作为军队政治工作的经常任务。虽然师政治部也曾发过拥政爱民的指示，但在王翰说来这不过是逢年过节的应景文章而已。王翰对军队政治工作应当对战时后勤工作起保证作用也是很不注意的，在他看来，动员民夫担架，筹集粮秣，以及救护转运伤员等工作，仅仅是地方和司令部的责任。凡是这些方面出了毛病，他不是责备地方，就是责备师司令部和师卫生部，很少检查政治工作上的缺点和责任。
    最突出的是王翰在五师工作期间对以工农出身的红军干部为建军骨干的组织路线抱抵抗态度。当时五师，是一支新组成的军队，如果不依靠经过战争考验而又有丰富军事经验的红军干部为骨干，很显然，就不可能保持人民军队的优良传统和党对部队的绝对领导，就不可能胜利地坚持艰苦的敌后游击战争。因此依靠工农出身的红军干部作为五师部队的骨干，是有关部队的党性问题，有关五师的胜利和失败的问题。这个带根本性的问题，应该是五师政治工作的依据，可是王翰却不是这样，他对这些老同志没有政治上的情感，在工作中看不起他们，甚至对他们抱有成见，总是格格不入，搞不到一块，这是五师同志人所共知的事。王翰看不到我们的老干部是来自劳动人民，对人民具有丰富的情感和血肉联系；他们具备着忠实于党、忠实于人民革命事业这一根本的优良的品质。这就证明了王翰缺乏无产阶级的立场和对劳动人民的阶级情感。
    为了达到在军队政治工作中排斥工农干部的目的，他公开主张连指导员应该用知识分子干部。当然我们并不反对军队政治工作中应该有而且也必须有一批忠实于无产阶级事业的知识分子干部。事实证明，知识分子干部在五师工作中一直是被信任和被重视的，在党的领导下，他们与老干部是团结的，并且对党的事业作了不小的贡献。但就当时的知识分子干部情况来说，一般的都还缺乏必要的思想改造，他们还存在着不少非无产阶级的思想、观点和缺乏坚定的无产阶级立场，同时也还缺乏战争经验和必要的工作锻炼。因此应该注意在实际工作中帮助他们获得必要的教育与改造。可是，王翰却以资产阶级知识分子的立场来看待这个问题。他说：工农干部只是东跑西颠，工作不如知识分子深入，工农干部只能罗列问题的现象，不能概括问题，不能发现问题的本质，所以不能算是深入的。不仅如此，王翰还别有用心的企图歪曲1942年中央的整风方针。大家知道，1942年整风运动的主要锋芒是克服党内的教条主义，而王翰却表示，五师的问题不是教条主义而是经验主义。他说：就五师工作的实际情况来说，不是教条主义多了而是教条主义少了。他这样说的用意是不难理解的，他是企图把五师部队整风运动的锋芒，引向反对经验主义，借以反对工农出身的红军干部。正是由于党的领导，王翰这些反党的错误思想、错误主张受到了应有的批判和抵制，因而没能传播开去。否则，对五师工作会带来严重的后果。
    王翰对地方工作也是以极端严重的右倾机会主义的观点来看待的。他认为地方工作的唯一任务，就是支援军队和为军队服务。他说：军事第一，胜利第一，应该是地方工作的中心任务；有了政权不会搞兵搞钱，就等于结了婚不会和老婆睡觉一样。他这种思想，正是剥削阶级军阀主义的反映，在当时的历史条件下，我们并不反对强调军队的重要，但是王翰的目的却在于取得指挥地方党的权力，以便达到他个人为所欲为的目的。“军事第一，胜利第一”的错误口号曾经起了恶化军民关系和助长地方工作强迫命令作风的恶果。王翰这种极端脱离群众，反对群众的剥削阶级的思想，还表现在他的生活作风上，不是和群众同甘共苦，而是十分讲究舒适和安逸，甚至为了要使他住的房子有足够的光线和空气，不惜凿坏老百姓的墙壁。他在五师养病的时候，组织上已经给予多方照顾，而且用钱也不少，这些还可以勉强说得过去，因为他有病，可是他竟讲究到不顾我们的主力部队当时常常没有菜金和草鞋费，甚至每天还吃不上三餐饭的这种困难和艰苦的情况，任意挥霍。为了消闲散闷，他不管工作受不受损失，专门调了两个干部来陪他话南道北，谈今论古。为了要有幽静的休养环境，他驱逐了房主人、打杀了村里的鸡犬，甚至不准驻在他附近的部队早晚吹号，这引起了群众和同志们的义愤。
    由此可见，王翰在五师政治部工作时期不是有什么了不起的功绩，相反的由于他的这些剥削阶级的错误思想和错误措施，给工作带来了不少的危害。王翰对于自己所犯的严重错误，照理说应当是采取虚心检查，深自内省的态度，以求克服缺点，纠正错误。可是他却是拒绝批评，坚持错误。在他看来，所有来自各方面对他的正确批评都是恶意攻击，一切来自下面的合理的抵制，都是党委直接干涉政治工作过多，不放手、不信任他，不给他撑腰的结果。因此他不但没有改正错误，相反地消极埋怨，说什么师政治部的工作困难呀！不好作呀！要求换一换工作岗位呀！实际上是怀着对区党委和师的领导的深刻不满。他曾公开的向下面散布他的这种不满情绪。
    强调国家监察工作的独立性，企图使国家监察工作脱离党的领导甚至企图把国家监察工作置于党和政府之上，这是王翰的一贯主张。他在中南监察委员会工作时，拒绝出席中南政法委员会的会议，他认为中南监察委员会是属于中央监察委员会领导的，而不应该接受中南党、政机关的领导。他曾说过：党管得太多了，应该让监察机关自成系统，垂直领导。不难看到，王翰强调监察工作的独立，不是为了别的，而是在向党争领导权，是在反对党的领导。以求满足他个人的野心。
    王翰对干部特别是对工农出身的干部缺乏应有的阶级友爱和同志式的关怀，工作中出了问题，总是责怪别人，从不检查自己，甚至冷嘲热讽，奚落人家。在工作中遇有不同意见，不是开诚讨论而是当面同意背后反对。对同志们的缺点和错误，也不是当面批评而是暗地告状，幸灾乐祸，他不高兴看见别的同志的工作比他做得好。1944年王翰因病调离了五师政治部，他对后来接替他的工作的同志不是采取帮助的态度，而是在师政治部的某些干部面前说这个同志的长短，弄得这个同志不能顺利地进行工作。这时，他却装着若无其事的在一旁看人家的笑话。
    从以上的事实中，可以看出王翰之所以堕落成为右派，绝不是偶然的，他虽然在大学念书的时候参加了党，至今已有二十五年，但是他从大地主家庭出身和所受的资产阶级教育里带来的剥削阶级的立场、思想、观点，始终不愿进行认真的改造。入党后一直在领导机关作负责工作，既没有经过群众运动和基层工作的锻炼，也没有经过严格的组织生活的锻炼，他与劳动人民没有任何感情，从不为人民的利益着想，而是处处谋求个人的权位。他有着极端严重的个人主义思想和个人野心，一贯的向党要权要势，他不管到哪个部门工作，他就想把这个部门的权力置于其他部门之上，一切都要听命于他。否则，不是消极，就是叫喊工作困难。他一贯地拒绝自我改造，拒绝党的教育和同志们的批评，坚持错误，轻视群众。他总想把个人置于党的组织之上，而不愿服从党组织的领导。根据监察部揭露出来的材料，王翰在近几年来，对于上述的错误，不仅丝毫没有克服，而且大有发展，因而当着社会主义革命的关头他日益堕落，走上了彻头彻尾的反党道路，这是必然的结果。因此我并不因为王翰是个右派分子而感到奇怪，相反的到认为现在把他揭露了出来正是党的整风运动的一个重大的胜利。
