    Russian Basketball Teams Hold Friendly Matches with Beijing Teams
    Men's Teams Tie, Beijing Women's Team Wins

    (Our Newspaper) Beijing—The Russian men's and women's basketball teams held friendly matches with the Beijing men's and women's basketball teams last night at the Beijing Gymnasium. The Russian men's team tied with the Beijing team with a score of 64 to 64, and the women's team lost to the Beijing team with a score of 48 to 68.

    The first match was the women's team competition.

    The guest team started with Vikshnina, Lesman, Babenko, Svetlova, and Yegreleva, while the home team responded with Yang Jie, Wang Xiafei, Li Shaofen, Ma Shenmei, and Zhou Yixian. At the beginning of the match, the guest team sometimes passed the ball to the center Yegreleva, who was 1.76 meters tall and darting under the basket, and sometimes had Lesman and Svetlova take mid-range shots. This unpredictable tactic allowed them to play with ease, scoring repeatedly and gaining the upper hand. The home team calmly responded, using Zhou Yixian and Li Shaofen as support under the basket, while the other three compressed the perimeter, attacking step by step. Ma Shenmei scored from mid-range, and Zhou Yixian and Li Shaofen jumped and scored, gradually catching up with the guest team. In the end, the Beijing women's team won the first quarter 14-11.

    The second quarter formed an interesting seesaw battle. The guest team's Yegreleva was successful with her hook shots under the basket, and Lesman and Vikshnina's mid-range shots were also successful. The home team's Wang Xiafei and Zhou Yixian's jump shots were also accurate. Therefore, the score remained very close: 16-17; 16-19; 18-19; 20-19; 22-19; 22-21;... Finally, it ended in a 24-24 tie.

    In the third and fourth quarters, the guest team replaced Chiliberbaude, who was 1.80 meters tall, and Khargikova, who was 1.76 meters tall, to strengthen their threat under the basket. However, they neglected defense, allowing the home team's Hu Yingxin and Fu Lianzhen to successfully steal baskets multiple times and complete two fast breaks very smoothly, ultimately losing 48-68.

    Next was the men's team competition. The Russian team's lineup was: Zubkov, Kanter, Kraev, Golov, and Batiantsev; the Beijing team's lineup was: Yang Boyong, Wang Lifa, Zhang Fukui, Zhang Fushan, and Qian Chenghai. The guest team's offense was to score through the 2.04-meter-tall center Zubkov and second center Kanter, with Kraev's mid-range shooting and Batiantsev's baseline cuts as support. The Beijing team, in response to this formation, used Zhang Fukui and Wang Lifa as dual centers to contain the guest team's dual centers, and used the agile Yang Boyong to closely guard Kraev, blocking his passing routes to the centers. The Beijing team itself quickly transitioned into counterattacks after gaining possession of the ball.

    The match started with both sides launching fierce attacks. The guest team's Zubkov scored first, then the guest team's guard committed a foul and Yang Boyong scored one point from a free throw. Zubkov then hooked in another basket, bringing the score to 4-1. The guest team's advantage did not last long. Yang Boyong, Wang Lifa, and Qian Chenghai scored continuously with free throws and shots. By the eighth minute, the Beijing team's score had exceeded the guest team's by ten points. At this time, the guest team's Zubkov and Kanter used their height and weight to put the ball into the basket several times, chasing the score all the way to 25-25. Then the guest team's Kraev was fouled out five times and replaced by Ajelev. The Beijing team also replaced Wang Lifa with Liu Erzhu, who was good at grabbing rebounds. Liu Erzhu scored twice with forceful layups. At the end of the first half, the Beijing team won by four points, 39-35. The Beijing team played skillfully and flexibly in the first half, with fast breaks, spread-out cuts, and mid-range shots all working well. Qian Chenghai was able to attack and defend, and his shooting was accurate. Yang Boyong's baseline cuts and mid-range shots also contributed a lot.

    At the beginning of the second half, the Beijing team was not as active as in the first half, and their play was not as smooth. The guest team's Zubkov and Kanter repeatedly scored. The Beijing team had trailed by as many as seven points. At this time, the guest team's main player Kanter was fouled out five times. Later, the Beijing team replaced Qian Chenghai and He Shisen, and their offense became active again. In the last three minutes, they chased the score to 64-63, taking a one-point lead.

    In the last three minutes, Qian Chenghai committed a foul, and Briegman, who replaced Kanter, scored one point from a free throw, bringing the score to 64-64. At this time, the home team slowed down their offensive speed, spread out their formation, and played control ball. The guest team immediately switched to tight marking, but with the ball firmly controlled by the home team, the guest team never got the ball. In the last thirty seconds, He Shisen of the Beijing team flashed past his opponent and dribbled straight to the basket, but he changed his mind at the last minute and brought the ball out, losing the last chance to win. As a result, the two teams shook hands and made peace with a score of 64-64.

    These forty minutes of the match were always exciting. The Beijing team's offense in the first half was excellent. The guest team's two tall centers posed a great threat to the Beijing team. Zubkov and Kanter scored 36 points with free throws and shots. Such a wonderful game is rare in Beijing.

    After the match, Vice Premier He Long and Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen met with the athletes of both sides and took photos with them. (Attached photo)

    俄罗斯篮球队同北京队举行友谊赛
    男子队打成平手  女子队北京队胜
    本报讯  俄罗斯男女篮球队昨晚在北京体育馆同北京市男女篮球队进行了友谊比赛。俄罗斯男子队以六十四比六十四与北京市队打成了平手，女子队以四十八比六十八败于北京市队。
    第一场是女子队比赛。
    客队以维克申娜、列斯曼、巴宾科、斯维特罗娃和叶格列娃上阵，主队以杨洁、王霞飞、李少芬、马申妹和周懿娴应战。比赛开始，客队忽而将球递给窜动于篮下的身高一点七六公尺的中锋叶格列娃，忽而令列斯曼、斯维特罗娃进行中距投篮，这一令人莫测的战术，使她们打来得心应手，接连中篮，夺得上风。主队则沉着应战，以周懿娴、李少芬作为篮下策应，其他三人作外围压缩，步步进攻，马申妹中距得分，周懿娴、李少芬跳起命中，分数逐渐赶上客队。最后，北京女子队以十四比十一胜了第一节。
    第二节形成了有趣的拉锯战，客队叶格列娃的篮下倒抅，列斯曼、维克申娜的中距投篮都很成功，主队王霞飞、周懿娴跳起投篮也很准确，因此，比分始终十分接近：十六比十七；十六比十九；十八比十九；二十比十九；二十二比十九；二十二比二十一；……最后打成了二十四平。
    第三、四节、客队换上身高一点八零公尺的齐里别尔鲍德和身高一点七六公尺的哈尔吉科娃，加强篮下威胁力。但是忽略了防守，使主队的胡英信、傅莲贞多次偷篮成功，和两次非常顺利地完成了快攻，终以四十八比六十八失败。
    接着是男子队比赛。俄罗斯队出场的是：祖布科夫、康捷里、克拉耶夫、戈洛夫和巴特奂舍夫；北京队出场的是：杨伯镛、王利发、张福奎、张福山、钱澄海。客队的攻势是通过身高二点零四公尺的中锋祖布科夫和第二中锋康捷里投篮得分，再配合克拉耶夫的中距离投篮和巴特奂舍夫的底线切入。北京队针对着这个阵势，以张福奎和王利发打双中锋来双双箝制客队的双中锋，再以动作灵活的杨伯镛死盯住克拉耶夫，堵死他供给中锋的球路。而北京队自己则在得球后迅速转入反攻。
    比赛一开始双方即展开猛攻，客队祖布科夫首先破篮得分，接着客队后卫犯规杨伯镛罚入一分，祖布科夫又勾手投入一球，比数成为四比一。客队的优势没有保持多久，杨伯镛、王利发、钱澄海连罚带投，连连得分。到第八分钟时，北京队得分超出客队十分。这时客队祖布科夫和康捷里利用身高体重，几次将球投入篮中，一直追到二十五比二十五。这时客队克拉耶夫五次犯规被罚下，由艾捷列夫替入。北京队也以善于抢夺篮板球的刘二柱易下王利发。刘二柱两次强行上篮得分。上半时结束时，三十九比三十五，北京队胜四分。北京队上半时打得熟练、灵活，快攻、拉开切入和中距离投篮都能得心应手，钱澄海能攻能守，投篮准确，杨伯镛端线切入和中距投篮也建了不少功。
    下半场开始时，北京队不似上半时活跃，打来也不如上半时顺手，而客队的祖布科夫和康捷里却一再得分，北京队最多曾输过七分，这时客队主力康捷里五次犯规出场，后北京队又换上钱澄海和何诗荪，攻势又活跃起来，到最后三分钟追成六十四比六十三反胜出一分。
    最后三分钟时，钱澄海犯规由替康捷里的勃列格曼罚入一分，比分成六十四比六十四。这时主队即放慢进攻速度，拉开阵线，打控制球，客队马上改成紧逼，但球在主队的稳稳控制下，客队始终没有得到球。在最后三十秒钟时，北京队何诗荪曾闪过对方，带球直奔篮下，他临时又改变了主意，把球带了出来，失却了最后一次获胜的机会。结果六十四比六十四，两队握手言和。
    这四十分钟的比赛，始终扣人心弦。北京队上半时的进攻很出色，客队的两个高大中锋给了北京队很大威胁，祖布科夫和康捷里两人连罚带投就得了三十六分。这样精彩的比赛在北京还是不多见的。
    比赛后，贺龙副总理和聂荣臻副总理接见了双方运动员，并和他们一起照了像。（附图片）
