Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: The Second National Soil and Water Conservation Conference convened by the State Council's Soil and Water Conservation Committee has recently concluded.

    During the conference, Vice Chairman Zhu De gave important instructions on soil and water conservation work. Vice Premier of the State Council Deng Zihui and Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee Tan Zhenlin delivered speeches at the meeting. Soviet experts Kaulnev, Banin, and Zaslavsky gave reports on soil and water conservation work. At the conference,负责人 and representatives of agricultural cooperatives from twenty-three provinces, special districts, and counties made typical speeches, introducing their experiences in carrying out soil and water conservation work. These instructions, reports, and introductions of typical experiences greatly encouraged the participants' confidence in leading and motivating the broad masses to transform natural conditions and control soil erosion.

    After extensive discussion, the conference formulated a preliminary plan for carrying out soil and water conservation work for the next ten years, determining that 63,800 square kilometers of soil erosion area should be initially controlled in 1958.

    Chen Zhengren, Director of the State Council's Soil and Water Conservation Committee, made a concluding report on the last day of the conference. He said that through this conference, the situation of soil erosion has been further clarified, the achievements and experiences in carrying out soil and water conservation work have been summarized, confidence has been boosted, and strength has been enhanced. Therefore, this conference is actually a mobilization meeting, a mobilization meeting for transforming nature and launching a major campaign towards nature. After this conference, the national soil and water conservation work will definitely be carried out on a larger scale and achieve greater results.

    He said that through research and discussion, we have further recognized the importance of soil and water conservation work in the following four aspects: First, it is a fundamental construction for agricultural production and also a fundamental construction in China's socialist construction. Water and soil are the most fundamental natural conditions for carrying out agricultural production. If soil and water conservation is not done well, agricultural production will be seriously affected. If the development of agriculture lags behind, it will not be able to meet the needs of industrial development for agricultural products, and socialist industrialization will also be affected. Therefore, carrying out soil and water conservation work is a fundamental measure for developing China's national economy. Second, the grain production targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) cannot be achieved in many areas if soil erosion is not eliminated. Every year, tens of millions of mu or more of cultivated land in China suffer from floods; tens of millions of mu or even more of cultivated land suffer from drought, which are fundamentally caused by soil erosion. Therefore, transforming natural conditions and controlling soil erosion have become one of the important links in achieving the 400, 500, and 800 jin yield targets. Third, the central government has decided that developing mountain resources and building mountain areas will be one of the important tasks during the Second Five-Year Plan period. When emphasizing marching into the mountains, we must also emphasize soil and water conservation work, otherwise, due to people's neglect, greater soil erosion may be caused in some areas. Fourth, the central government has proposed that China should strive to catch up with or surpass Britain in terms of the output of steel and other important industrial products within the next fifteen years. Developing industry requires electricity, and power generation equipment itself is an important industry. Developing hydropower in our country is also a major part of expanding electricity. To develop hydropower, it is necessary to build reservoirs and hydropower stations. If soil and water conservation work is not done well, the lifespan of the reservoirs will be shortened due to sediment deposition, which will reduce the power generation efficiency of the hydropower stations. Therefore, from this perspective, it is also necessary to do a good job in soil and water conservation.

    Chen Zhengren said that we now have unprecedentedly favorable conditions for carrying out soil and water conservation work. In addition to the realization of agricultural cooperation, we have also accumulated rich experience. The basic experiences that can be summarized from the typical speeches at the conference are eight. These experiences in carrying out soil and water conservation work are: First, overall planning should be carried out and implemented in phases and regions; second, centralized management (such as centralized management by large and small watersheds) and continuous management; third, comprehensive utilization, comprehensive management, with small-scale projects as the main focus; fourth, combining symptomatic and radical treatment, combining slope and gully treatment, with slope treatment as the main focus; fifth, relying on the masses and combining with production; sixth, creating models, relying on key points, and promoting comprehensively; seventh, combining regular capital construction with shock campaigns; eighth, unified leadership by the Party committee and people's committees at all levels, and cooperation among various departments. He said that these experiences are of universal significance, but some of these experiences must be adapted to local conditions and cannot be applied mechanically.

    Chen Zhengren pointed out: To do a good job in soil and water conservation, we must study its characteristics. Its characteristics generally include the following: First, the area is relatively large. The area of soil erosion in China is 1.5 million square kilometers, accounting for slightly less than one-sixth of the total land area of the mainland. This situation determines the arduousness of controlling soil erosion. Second, the workload of maintaining soil and water in soil erosion areas is large, and it is necessary to rely on the masses; and the quality of this work directly affects local agricultural production, and the masses are willing to do it, so it is determined that this work is a mass work. Third, maintaining soil and water is a long-term task. If it is relaxed even slightly, the soil and water will be lost again, so this work cannot be stopped. Fourth, it is a comprehensive task, and agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy departments must closely cooperate. Fifth, soil and water conservation is easy to destroy and difficult to control.

    He said that according to these characteristics and past experiences, the principles for carrying out soil and water conservation work should be two. One is a national principle, which is: "Giving equal importance to prevention and treatment, and giving equal importance to treatment and maintenance"; the other principle is the management principle for soil erosion areas, which is: "On the basis of relying on the masses to develop agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery production, implement comprehensive planning, and carry out centralized management, continuous management, comprehensive management, and combining gully and slope treatment, with slope treatment as the main focus, in accordance with local conditions."

    In his concluding report, Chen Zhengren also elaborated on how to formulate soil and water conservation plans, the tasks of agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and scientific research departments, and several policy issues related to carrying out soil and water conservation work. He emphasized that to do a good job in soil and water conservation, the key issue lies in strengthening leadership. Therefore, leading organs at all levels must put this work on the agenda.

    Chen Zhengren pointed out that as far as the current soil and water conservation work is concerned, the phenomenon of uneven progress must be overcome. One-third of the time for completing the annual soil and water conservation work plan for 1958 has passed, but some provinces have not yet taken action or have not taken action well. Even in provinces with faster progress such as Gansu, Liaoning, Hebei, Henan, Sichuan, and Guangdong, only 31% of the annual plan has been completed so far. Therefore, if we do not show greater determination and effort to carry out soil and water conservation work, it is questionable whether the task can be completed. For this reason, all localities must check the implementation of tasks, calculate tasks, time, and labor, and set a schedule for completing the plan. On the premise of integrating the rectification of the commune with production and paying attention to safety and quality, we should push the soil and water conservation work to a climax.

    The conference started on December 4th and ended on the 21st. Participants in the conference included负责人 of agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy departments and soil and water conservation departments of various provinces and autonomous regions,党政负责人 of key special districts and counties, directors of typical agricultural cooperatives, representatives of key soil and water conservation experimental stations and relevant scientific research departments, and representatives of relevant departments in Beijing, totaling more than 290 people.

    全国水土保持工作会议订出十年水土保持规划
    控制水土流失　消灭水旱灾害
    新华社23日讯　国务院水土保持委员会召开的第二次全国水土保持工作会议已在最近结束。
    在会议举行期间，朱德副主席到会对水土保持工作作了重要指示。国务院副总理邓子恢、中共中央书记处书记谭震林在会上发表了讲话。苏联专家考尔涅夫、巴宁和扎斯拉夫斯基作了有关水土保持工作的报告。在大会上还有二十三个省、专区、县的负责人和农业社的代表作了典型发言，介绍了开展水土保持工作的经验。这些指示、报告和典型经验介绍，大大地鼓舞了与会者领导与带动广大群众改造自然条件控制水土流失的信心。
    会议经过广泛讨论，订出了今后十年开展水土保持工作的初步规划，确定1958年要初步控制水土流失面积六万三千八百平方公里。
    国务院水土保持委员会主任陈正人在会议的最后一天作了总结报告。他说，通过这次会议，进一步摸清了水土流失情况，总结了开展水土保持工作的成绩和经验，鼓舞了信心，增强了力量，因此这次会议实际上是一次动员大会，是改造自然向自然展开大进军的动员大会，在这次会议以后，全国的水土保持工作一定会更大规模地开展起来，取得更大的成绩。
    他说，经过研究和讨论，我们从以下四个方面进一步认识了水土保持工作的重要性：首先，它是农业生产的一项根本建设，也是我国社会主义建设中的一项根本建设。水和土是实行农业生产的自然方面最根本的条件，水土保持搞不好，农业生产就要受到严重影响。农业的发展如果落后，便不能满足工业的发展对农产品的需要，这样社会主义工业化也要受到影响。因此，开展水土保持工作是发展我国国民经济的一项根本措施。其次，全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的粮食产量指标，如果不消灭水土流失现象，在很多地区是不可能实现的。我国每年都有几千万亩或更多的耕地遭受水灾；有几千万亩甚至更多的耕地遭受旱灾，根本上都是由于水土流失造成的。因此，改造自然条件，控制水土流失，就成了实现四百、五百、八百斤产量指标的重要环节之一。第三，中央决定，在第二个五年计划期间已把开发山区富源建设山区作为重要工作之一。在强调向山区进军的时候，必须同时强调水土保持工作，否则由于人们的忽视，有可能在部分地区造成更大的水土流失。第四，中央提出，我国要争取在今后十五年的期间内，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国，发展工业就需要电力，发电设备本身就是重要的工业，而我国发展水力发电事业又是扩大电力的一项主要内容，要发展水力发电，就要修建水库和水电站，如果水土保持工作搞不好，水库的寿命就会因泥沙淤积而缩短，这样水电站的发电效能就要减低。因此，从这方面看，也必须做好水土保持工作。
    陈正人说，我们现在开展水土保持工作，有了前所未有的有利条件，除了农业已经实现合作化以外，还积累了丰富的经验。从大会上的典型发言中可以归纳出的基本经验共有八条。这些开展水土保持工作的经验是：第一，要全面规划，分期分区实施；第二，集中治理（如按大、小流域集中治理），连续治理；第三，全面利用，综合治理，小型为主；第四，治标治本相结合，坡沟兼治，治坡为主；第五，依靠群众，结合生产；第六，创造典型，依托重点，全面推广；第七，常年基本建设与突击运动相结合；第八，党委和各级人民委员会统一领导，各部门协作。他说，这些经验是有普遍意义的，但是其中有些经验在运用的时候，必须因地制宜，不能生搬硬套。
    陈正人指出：要想搞好水土保持工作，必须研究它的特点。它的特点一般说来有以下几条：首先，面积较广。我国水土流失面积共有一百五十万平方公里，占大陆国土总面积六分之一稍弱，这种情况决定了控制水土流失的艰巨性。其次，在水土流失地区保持水土的工作量大，须要依靠群众；而这个工作的好坏，又直接左右着当地的农业生产，群众愿意搞，因此，便决定了这件工作是群众性的工作。第三，保持水土是长期性的工作，稍一放松，水土又会流失，因此，这个工作不能停止。第四，它是一件综合性的工作，农、林、水利等部门必须密切配合。第五，水土保持，破坏容易，控制较难。
    他说，根据这些特点和以往的经验，开展水土保持工作的方针应该有两条。一条是全国性的方针，这条方针是：“预防与治理兼顾，治理与养护并重”；另一条方针是水土流失地区的治理方针，这条方针是：“在依靠群众发展农、林、牧、副业生产的基础上，实行全面规划，因地制宜地集中治理，连续治理，综合治理，沟坡兼治，治坡为主”。
    陈正人在总结报告中，还阐述了如何制订水土保持规划、农、林、水利和科学研究等部门的任务以及有关开展水土保持工作的几个政策问题等等。他强调指出：要想做好水土保持工作，关键问题是在于加强领导，因此，各地各级领导机关必须把这个工作摆上议事日程。
    陈正人指出：就当前的水土保持工作来说，必须克服进展不平衡的现象。完成1958年年度水土保持工作计划的时间已经过了三分之一，但是有些省还没有行动起来或行动得很不好。就是在进展较快的甘肃、辽宁、河北、河南、四川、广东等省，目前也只不过完成年度计划的31％。因此，如不拿出更大的决心和劲头开展水土保持工作，任务能否完成是有问题的。为此，各地必须检查一次任务执行情况，计算任务、时间和劳力，定出完成计划的进度计划，在整社生产互相结合和注意安全、质量的前提下，把水土保持工作推向高潮。
    这次会议是12月4日开始的，21日结束。参加会议的有各省、自治区的农业、林业、水利部门和水土保持部门的负责人，各重点专区、县的党政负责人，典型农业社社主任，重点水土保持试验站和有关科学研究部门以及北京有关部门的代表等共二百九十多人。（附图片）
