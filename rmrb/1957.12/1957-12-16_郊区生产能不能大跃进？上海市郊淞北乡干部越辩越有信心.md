Can Suburban Production Leap Forward?
Cadres of Songbei Township in Shanghai Suburbs Become More Confident Through Debate

According to a report in the Liberation Daily, cadres in Songbei Township, Shanghai's suburbs, engaged in heated discussions and debates about the Twelve-Year Plan for agricultural development in the suburbs and the 1958 agricultural production Great Leap Forward plan. This greatly enhanced their socialist awareness, replacing the "small-footed woman" mentality with revolutionary thinking about the Great Leap Forward and clarifying the township's production direction.

What Should Be the Main Focus of Suburban Production?

During the discussion of the production plan, everyone was very enthusiastic, and in principle, they firmly supported the production leap forward targets. However, disagreements arose when they got to the practical problems. According to the requirements of the suburban agricultural production plan proposed by the leading organs, Songbei Township should shift from focusing on grain and cotton production to focusing on animal husbandry. However, during the discussion, a debate first arose over pig farming. Some said: Raising pigs involves "three more and three less": more labor, more costs, more basic construction; less output, less income, less dividends for members. Therefore, they believed that raising pigs was not as good as farming, and could not be compared with raising dairy cows. Dairy cows earn money every day, while you don't see any money from raising pigs for seven or eight months. Yang Xiangfa, director of the animal husbandry committee of Red Flag First Cooperative, said: Raising pigs doesn't make money and even loses capital. The more pigs raised, the more the cooperative loses. Later, some people pointed out that the purpose of raising pigs is not only to make money, but more importantly to accumulate fertilizer and supply pork to the city. By calculating the benefits of raising pigs for fertilizer, everyone unanimously agreed that vigorously developing pig farming could solve the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer for farmland and create conditions for a bumper harvest. For the country, it can reduce the difficulty of transporting pigs from other places to Shanghai, and ensure a timely supply of fresh pork to Shanghai citizens. If each pig is raised well, it can also increase the cooperative's income by ten to fifteen yuan. After a great debate, Yang Xiangfa, who originally had conflicting ideas, also realized that raising pigs benefits the country, the cooperative, and the members. Everyone's opinions on pig farming became consistent, and the production direction became clearer.

Can the High Cotton Yield Target Be Achieved?

Everyone was clear about the future production direction, but there were still different views on the production targets. Some people thought that the currently stipulated production targets were rash advances, while others thought that this was not a rash advance, but rather that production had been backward in the past. Both sides cited a large number of facts to illustrate their points. Yang A'si was a proponent of the "rash advance" theory. He said: "It is a dream to achieve an average yield of 160 jin of ginned cotton per mu in the next ten years. The suburban agricultural development plan is a rash advance. The National Forty Articles require an average yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu in the next ten years. Why should we in the suburbs reach 160 jin? During last year's high tide, it was said that each mu of ginned cotton would yield 120 jin, but the result was a failure. This time, we can't just talk about it and be done with it." Everyone cited strong facts to refute him. This year's grain output is lower than last year's, which is due to the leadership relaxing its leadership over agricultural production in the second half of last year and this year. The masses criticized that during this period there were four less: "Fewer visits and comparisons, less promotion of experience, fewer cadres going to the countryside, and fewer instructions reaching the cooperative." This proves that to achieve a bumper harvest, the leadership and the masses must have a concerted effort. By now, many comrades realized that it was not a rash advance, but a great lag, and that we must try everything possible to catch up. Everyone also pointed out that according to the township's direction of developing animal husbandry production, if the fields that are not suitable for cotton cultivation are converted to fodder crops in the future, the remaining fields will be high-yielding cotton fields. Then, by 1967, an average yield of 160 jin of ginned cotton per mu is completely achievable.

Rely on the State or Rely on Ourselves?

Who should we rely on to achieve the new production targets? Two obviously different viewpoints emerged again. Some people believe that achieving the new direction mainly depends on the state's support; others believe that state support is also necessary, but we should mainly rely on the farmers' own hard work. The focus of this debate is whether fertilizer and feed should be simply supplied by the state or mainly rely on self-reliance. Some people said that the township has no source of fertilizer, and there is no way without relying on the state. After a period of debate, everyone realized that although the state is trying its best to increase the production of chemical fertilizers, it still cannot fully meet the needs of farmers across the country. In the past, the state supplied more to the suburbs, but in the future, it should take care of farmers all over the country, and the fertilizer problem of suburban farmers should be mainly solved by themselves.

Everyone cited examples of the great fertilizer potential in the suburbs. Cao Genxiang said: Wusong Town has nearly 2,000 dan of garbage every day, which has not been well utilized in the past. Last year, a production team in his cooperative mixed the garbage they picked up with pig manure and cow manure to fertilize the fields, and the effect was very good. The inland rivers in the whole township have been dredged, so small boats can be used to transport garbage to each cooperative. Through discussion, everyone put forward many ways to accumulate fertilizer, among which the most fundamental way to accumulate fertilizer is still raising pigs. On average, the fertilizer accumulated by each pig in a year can solve the fertilizer problem for one and a half to two mu of cotton and grain fields. After calculating the fertilizer account, everyone's confidence was further enhanced.

Slowly or a Great Leap Forward?

Most people have the enthusiasm for production and are determined to do a good job in the great production of 1958 with the revolutionary spirit of moving mountains and overturning seas, but some people still do not have enough enthusiasm and advocate to take it slowly. This opinion was immediately opposed by the majority. Many comrades pointed out that, according to the current situation, the originally stipulated production targets for 1958 are obviously conservative and backward. They expressed that they wanted to engage in agricultural production with a revolutionary spirit and proposed the slogan of "turn over, jump, double." Turning over means changing the township's original plan for an average yield of 120 jin of seed cotton per mu next year to 250 jin; the number of pigs this year is 3,400, and next year it should be 7,000. Jumping means jumping the rice from an average of 500 jin per mu this year to 800 jin per mu next year; dairy cows should jump from 94 this year to 150 next year. In other crops and animal husbandry, the originally stipulated targets should also be broken through.

In an atmosphere of high mass enthusiasm, Huang Silin, secretary of the general branch, made a speech. He said that the original production targets for 1958 are indeed backward now, and a Great Leap Forward is entirely possible. As long as we set advanced targets based on the conditions and in a realistic manner, it will not be turning over and jumping from the air, but can be achieved. Based on the township's situation, he put forward eight conditions, five major measures, and three guarantees. There are five favorable conditions among the eight conditions: First, the natural climate is good. In the Yangtze River Delta region, the time with strong winds and heavy snow is very short in a year; second, we are a water-network township and are not afraid of drought; third, the land is flat, which is easy to cultivate; fourth, the soil is relatively good; fifth, the potential for fertilizer is very large. There are also three difficult conditions: First, there is a shortage of feed and fertilizer; second, individual members want to take the capitalist road; third, there is more land and less labor. However, as long as we give full play to our potential, we can overcome the difficulties. Through great debate, the members who originally wanted to take the capitalist road have raised their awareness and are determined to take the socialist road. As for the labor issue, more than 600 cadres will be sent down to the four cooperatives in the township. They not only bring labor, but also bring us politics and culture, turning our difficult conditions into favorable conditions. With these conditions, we must conscientiously implement the five major measures of vigorously accumulating fertilizer, building water conservancy, selecting good varieties, sowing early and in a timely manner, and improving farming techniques. To achieve these five major measures, we must put forward three guarantees: ideological guarantee, organizational guarantee, and material guarantee. With these measures and guarantees, production will definitely make a Great Leap Forward.

　　郊区生产能不能大跃进？
　　上海市郊淞北乡干部越辩越有信心
    据解放日报报道　上海市郊区淞北乡干部在讨论郊区农业发展十二年规划和1958年农业生产大跃进的计划的过程中，热烈地展开了大鸣大放大争，社会主义觉悟大大提高，大跃进的革命思想，代替了“小脚女人”的思想，明确了本乡的生产方向。
    郊区生产应以什么为主？
    在讨论生产规划的时候，大家情绪十分热烈，在原则上都坚决拥护生产跃进指标。但是一接触到实际问题，就发生了分歧。根据领导机关提出的郊区农业生产规划的要求，淞北乡应该由以粮棉生产为主改变为以畜牧业生产为主。但是在讨论当中，首先是对养猪问题发生了争论。有人说：养猪是三多三少：人工多，成本多，基本建设多；产量少，收入少，社员分红少。因此，认为养猪不如种田好，更不能和养奶牛相比较，奶牛每天都赚钱，猪养七八个月还见不到钞票。红旗一社畜牧委员会主任杨祥发说：养猪不赚钱，还要赔老本，猪越养的多，社里赔本越多。后来有人提出，养猪的目的不仅是为了赚钱，更重要的是积肥和以猪肉供应城市。通过算养猪积肥的账，大家一致认为，大力发展养猪，就可解决农田肥料不足的困难，并为丰收创造条件。对国家来说，可减少从外地往上海运猪的困难，又可保证及时供应上海市民新鲜猪肉。每头猪要养的好，还可为合作社增加十元至十五元收入。经过大争论，原来思想不通的杨祥发也认识到养猪对国家对合作社对社员都有好处。大家对养猪的看法意见一致了，对生产的方向也就更明确了。
    棉花高产指标能否实现？
    大家对今后的生产方向明确了，但是对生产指标还有不同的看法。有人认为现在规定的生产指标是冒进了，有人认为这不是冒进，而是过去生产落后了。两种人都举出大量的事实，来说明自己的观点。杨阿四是“冒进”论者。他说：“在今后十年内每亩平均皮棉要达到一百六十斤，那是梦想。郊区农业发展规划是个冒进的规划。全国四十条纲要，要求在今后十年每亩平均皮棉产量，达到一百斤，我们郊区为什么要达到一百六十斤？去年高潮时，说每亩皮棉要收一百二十斤，结果是落空了。这次可不能光嘴巴讲讲算事。”大家举出了有力的事实来反驳他。今年的粮食产量比去年低，这是由于领导上在去年下半年和今年放松了对农业生产的领导。群众批评说，在这段时间内是四少：“参观评比少，经验推广少，干部下乡少，指示到社少。”证明要获得丰收，领导和群众必须有一股劲。至此，很多同志认识到现在不是冒进，而是大大落后了，只有想尽一切办法赶上去。大家又举出：根据本乡发展畜牧生产为主的方向，如果将来不适合种棉花的田改种饲料作物，留下的都是高产量棉花田，那末，到1967年，平均亩收一百六十斤皮棉是完全有把握的。
    靠国家还是靠自己？
    依靠谁来实现新的生产指标呢？又发生了两种显然不同的观点。有些人认为实现新方向，主要要依靠国家的支援；另一种人认为，国家支援也是必要的，但主要应依靠农民自己艰苦奋斗。这个问题争论的焦点是肥料和饲料到底是单纯靠国家供应，还是主要靠自力更生。有人说，本乡没有肥料来源，不靠国家没有办法。经过一番争论，大家都认识到现在国家虽然在尽力增产化学肥料，但还不能充分满足全国农民的需要。过去国家对市郊的供应多了，今后应照顾到全国各地的农民，郊区农民的肥料问题应主要靠自己来解决。
    大家纷纷举出郊区有很大的肥料潜力的例子。曹根祥说：吴淞镇每天有近二千担垃圾，过去都没有很好利用。去年他的合作社的一个生产队把挑回去的垃圾和猪粪、牛粪混合起来肥田，效果非常好。全乡的内河都修通了，就可以用小船把垃圾运到每个合作社。通过讨论，大家又提出了许多积肥的办法，其中最根本的积肥办法还是养猪。平均每头猪一年所积的肥料，能解决一亩半到两亩棉粮田的肥料。算过肥料的账，大家更加提高了信心。
    慢慢来还是大跃进
    大多数人的生产劲头是有了，决心以移山倒海的革命精神来搞好1958年的大生产，但有一部分人劲头还不足，主张要慢慢来。这个意见立即遭到大多数人的反对。许多同志都提出：根据现在情况来看，原来规定的1958年的生产指标，显然是一个保守落后的指标。表示要用革命的精神搞农业生产，要提出“翻一翻，跳一跳，加一倍”的口号。翻一翻就是要把本乡原来计划明年棉花平均每亩产籽棉一百二十斤的指标，改为二百五十斤；猪今年是三千四百头，到明年就要有七千头。跳一跳就是要把水稻从今年每亩平均五百斤，明年跳到每亩平均八百斤；奶牛由今年的九十四头跳到明年的一百五十头。在其他的农作物和畜牧业方面也都要突破原来规定的指标。
    在群众情绪十分高涨的气氛中，总支书记黄思霖作了发言。他说，原来的1958年生产指标现在看来的确是落后了，来一个大跃进是完全可能的。只要我们根据条件，实事求是地订出先进指标，就不是从空中翻从空中跳，而是能实现的。他根据本乡情况，提出了八个条件，五大措施，三项保证。八个条件中有五个有利条件：一、自然气候好，在长江三角洲地区，一年有大风大雪的时间很短；二、我们是个水网乡不怕旱；三、土地平坦，便于耕种；四、土壤比较好；五、肥料潜在力很大。困难条件也有三个：一、饲料肥料不足；二、个别社员想走资本主义道路；三、土地多，劳力少。但是只要充分发挥潜力，就能克服困难。通过大辩论，原来想走资本主义道路的社员，觉悟提高了，坚决走社会主义道路了。至于人力问题，有六百多名干部要下放到全乡的四个合作社，他们不仅带来了劳动力，还给我们带来了政治和文化，使我们的困难条件变成了有利条件。有了这些条件，我们必须认真贯彻大力积肥、兴修水利、选好优良品种、提早和及时播种、改进耕作技术的五大措施。要实现这五大措施，就必须提出三个保证：这就是思想保证、组织保证、物质保证。有了这些措施和保证，生产一定能大跃进。
