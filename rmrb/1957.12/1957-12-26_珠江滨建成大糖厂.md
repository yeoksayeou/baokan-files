Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 25th: The Nanhai Sugar Factory, a large sugar factory on the banks of the Pearl River with a daily sugarcane crushing capacity of 2,000 tons, designed, manufactured, and installed by China itself, held a state acceptance ceremony and start-up ceremony on the morning of the 24th. Immediately afterward, sugarcane was continuously fed into the workshop, officially commencing production. At that moment, more than 1,000 employees and sugarcane farmers from nearby villages celebrated this joyous event with gongs, drums, and colorful lion dances.

The factory's annual output will be more than 43,000 tons of white sugar, making it one of the sugar factories with the highest sugar production in China. Its entire production process is basically automated and mechanized. Due to the use of new equipment, the sugar extraction rate will reach 97%, higher than other sugar factories.

The Guangzhou Sugar Industry Design Institute, Guangzhou General Machinery Factory, and Guangzhou Sugar and Wine Installation Company respectively designed, manufactured, and installed this sugar factory.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 24th: Yunnan Province's largest mechanized sugar factory to date, the Nujiang Sugar Factory in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, officially went into production on the 22nd.

Currently, the sugar factory is crushing 100 tons of sugarcane daily, producing about 10 tons of white sugar. Production will gradually increase, and it is estimated that in two months, it will be able to crush 200 tons of sugarcane daily, producing about 20 tons of white sugar. These products will not only supply the Dehong Autonomous Prefecture's sugar needs but also be supplied to other regions.

The Nujiang Sugar Factory is located in Nujiang Dam in Dehong Autonomous Prefecture, where the climate is mild and the soil is fertile, suitable for sugarcane cultivation. Currently, the highest yield reaches 18,000 jin per mu, and generally is between 7,000 and 8,000 jin.

    珠江滨建成大糖厂
    据新华社广州25日电  我国第一次自行设计制造安装的日榨二千吨甘蔗的大糖厂——位于珠江之滨的南海糖厂，24日上午举行了国家验收和开机动用典礼。接着，甘蔗源源输入车间，正式开始生产了。这时，在场的一千多名职工和来自附近村庄的蔗农，敲锣打鼓舞着彩狮庆祝这个喜事。
    这个厂的年产量将为白砂糖四万三千多吨，是我国目前产糖量最多的糖厂之一。它的整个生产过程基本上是自动化、机械化的。由于采用了新式设备，糖分抽出率将达到97％，高于别的糖厂。
    广州制糖工业设计院、广州通用机器厂和广州糖酒安装公司，分别设计制造和安装了这个糖厂。
    新华社昆明24日电  云南省目前最大的一座机械化糖厂——德宏傣族景颇族自治州怒江糖厂已在22日正式投入生产。
    现在糖厂每天压榨一百吨甘蔗，生产白糖约十吨，以后将陆续增加，估计两个月以后，每天可压榨二百吨甘蔗，生产白糖二十吨左右。这些产品除供应德宏自治州食糖需要外还可供应外地。
    怒江糖厂设在德宏自治州怒江坝，这里气候温和，土质肥沃，适宜种植甘蔗。目前，产量最高的每亩达到一万八千斤，一般都在七、八千斤。
