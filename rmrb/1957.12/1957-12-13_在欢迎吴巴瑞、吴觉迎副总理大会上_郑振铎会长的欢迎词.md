Respected Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe, Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein, distinguished guests, friends:

    We are with great pleasure to warmly welcome Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe, Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein of the Union of Burma, and all friends of the delegation they lead.

    Friends, Deputy Prime Ministers U Ba Swe and U Kyaw Nyein are respected friends of the Chinese people. They are famous political activists in the Union of Burma. From very early on, they actively engaged in the struggle against imperialism and for national independence, and made great contributions to the cause of the Burmese people's struggle for independence and autonomy. In strengthening the unity of Burma with Asian and African countries and safeguarding world peace, the contributions of the two Deputy Prime Ministers are also admirable. In particular, their arduous journey and the fact that they braved the severe cold to visit China for a friendly visit, further demonstrates their enthusiasm and sincerity in strengthening Sino-Burmese friendship. This is very touching to us.

    The Sino-Burmese Friendship Association has been honored to receive many Burmese relatives and friends who have visited China. Last October, in this very place, we were honored to gather to welcome Prime Minister U Nu. Through contact with Burmese friends, our feelings for Sino-Burmese friendship have become increasingly profound, and the deep friendship between the people of the two countries has closely linked us together. China and Burma are both countries with a long history but are also young nations. Our common desire is to change the backwardness of our countries caused by long-term imperialist aggression. We all urgently hope to develop our national economies and national cultures in a peaceful environment. In the work of building our respective countries, China and Burma need to support each other and learn from each other. Friendship and unity are our common language.

    Friends, the long-standing and profound Sino-Burmese friendship has broad prospects for development under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In order to further consolidate and strengthen Sino-Burmese friendship, we are willing to work together with our Burmese friends.

    Respected Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe and Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein: Your visit to China has brought us the friendship of the Burmese people, and we sincerely thank you. We hope you will bring the friendship of the Chinese people back to Burma. Your efforts will push the cause of Sino-Burmese friendship further forward. The days you spend visiting China will leave us with very pleasant and friendly memories.

    Now let us shout:

    Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!

    Long live world peace!
