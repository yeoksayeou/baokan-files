Miscellaneous Poems on a Journey to the West
Ye Jianying

    On the way to Moscow
    Tune: Remembering Wangsun (Composed in the plane with comrades Junrui and Tian Han)
    Jet planes cleave the clouds in celebratory flight, Lenin, were he here, would find solace in our hearts,
    The struggle now extends to the moon's domain,
    No need to guess, the Western world toils in vain.

    In Moscow
    The old map of forty years ago, a pioneering zone of rivers, mountains, and people,
    Which path leads to the immortal realm? Point to the path of the October Revolution.
    The paths of heaven and earth differ, the Soviet Union leads the way,
    Just heard the joyous strains of the Communist song, now opening up the vast expanse of the stars.

    In Leningrad
    Studying in the Soviet Union, traveling ten thousand miles, arriving in Leningrad before nightfall,
    Friends are hospitable and very kind, seeing me off and welcoming me from afar, late at night and early in the morning.
    The October Revolution, a cannon shot, the cannon shot rang from Leningrad,
    Lingering, unable to leave, paying respects to the former residence of the great teacher.

    In Minsk
    Timoshenko's old fame is known, his vigor makes one suspect fat is growing on his thighs,
    He walks, talks, and eats heartily, still capable of winning golden cities in a hundred battles.
    Not a single tile remains in Minsk, celebrating its rebirth with ten spring breezes,
    Achieving good neighborliness with fewer border guards, prosperity everywhere, with singing voices.

    In Kiev
    Chuikov of Stalingrad, an isolated army facing the water with no fear of isolation,
    Casually talking about the events of Chongqing back then, realizing the difficulty of the united front.
    Visiting the ancient capital by the Dnieper River, a new model of broad mansions unfolds,
    Late at night, paying respects at the heroes' cemetery, bonfires burn brightly from dawn till dusk.

    In Tbilisi
    Ten miles of lights line the mountains and riverbanks, the Milky Way is clearly visible in the human world,
    In the quiet mountain city at night, climbing the mountain, the tiger general could not untie the ring before the pass.
    Are the thousands of trials and tribulations in vain? After all, staunch Party spirit is high,
    Talking about the dangerous situation in the Near East, as the banquet ends, a small ring knife is given as a gift.

    In Khabarovsk
    Haven't seen Galen in thirty years, the Eastern Expedition and Northern Expedition required assistance,
    I come to Khabarovsk, feeling nostalgic, wanting to go to the Red River to recognize the claw marks.
         (In the winter of 1929, I participated in training soldiers at the Red River)

    Visiting the Pacific Fleet in Vladivostok
    Friendship is deeper than the Pacific Ocean, consolidating the Sino-Soviet coastal defense,
    Even if missiles can shoot thousands of miles, how can they compare to unity and strength?

    Returning from Khabarovsk to Beijing
    The sky is vast and the sea wide as I fly back, ten thousand miles of mountains and rivers enter my wine cup,
    Pointing to the Great Wall, reaching the sea at the pass, the homebound person smiles happily.

    西行杂诗
    叶剑英
      赴莫斯科途中
    忆王孙（机中和俊瑞、田汉两同志）
    喷气排云庆祝来，列宁如在慰胸怀，
    斗争又向月球开，
    不须猜，西方世界苦安排。
    在莫斯科
    四十年前旧版图，河山人物占先区，
    仙乡欲到沿何路，指出十月革命途。
    天上人间道路殊，苏联为首作前驱，
    才闻共产歌声乐，又辟茫茫星际途。
    在列宁格勒
    游学苏联万里行，宵征前到列宁城，
    友人好客殷勤甚，深夜清晨远送迎。
    十月革命一声炮，炮声响自列宁城，
    低回留之不能去，参拜先师故宅情。
    在明斯克
    铁摩辛可旧知名，矍铄还疑髀肉生，
    健步健谈还健饭，尚堪百战夺金城。
    无存片瓦明斯克，十度春风庆再生，
    取得睦邻边警少，繁荣到处踏歌声。
    在基辅
    斯大林城崔可夫，孤军背水不愁孤，
    漫谈重庆当年事，省识艰难统战殊。
    聂泊河边访古都，康衢广厦展新模，
    更深拜谒英雄墓，篝火长明旦复晡。
    在梯比利斯
    十里灯光岸夹山，星河历历在人间，
    山城夜静登山去，虎将关前不解环。
    千磨百炼岂徒劳，毕竟坚贞党性高，
    谈到近东风险恶，酒阑还赠小环刀。
    在伯力
    不见加伦三十年，东征北伐费支援，
    我来伯力多怀旧，欲到红河认爪痕。
         （1929年冬我曾参加红河练兵）
    在海参威访太平洋舰队
    友情深过太平洋，巩固中苏沿海防，
    纵有导弹射千里，怎如团结一心强。
    由伯力返北京
    天空海阔驾机回，万里山河入酒杯，
    指点长城关竟海，思归人亦笑颜开。
