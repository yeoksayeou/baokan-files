Xinhua News Agency, December 25th: A large-scale cold storage plant newly built in Beijing began operation yesterday.

　　This cold storage plant has two mechanized cold storage facilities and an ice-making room with a daily output of 15 tons of artificial ice. The cold storage looks like a seven-story building without windows from afar, and can store a total of 13,500 tons of food. There are thirty well-equipped large storage rooms with different properties in the cold storage. Fresh fruits stored here for a year will still have the same color as when they were just picked. There is also a quick-freezing room maintained at minus 23 degrees Celsius. Chickens, ducks, fish, etc., sent here can be frozen like ice cubes in six hours.

    七层楼高的冷藏库
    据新华社25日讯　北京新建成的一座规模很大的冷冻厂昨天开始使用。
    这座冷冻厂有两个机械化的冷藏库和一个日产十五吨人造冰的制冰间。冷藏库远看像一座无窗户的七层楼房，总共能够储藏一万三千五百吨食品。冷藏库里有三十个设备完善、不同性能的大储藏间，新鲜水果在这里储藏一年，颜色仍旧像刚摘下来的一样。还有保持在摄氏零下二十三度的急冻间，鸡、鸭、鱼等送到这里，六个小时就能冻得像冰块一样。
