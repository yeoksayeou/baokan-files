Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 15th: Two pairs of mine shafts built in the Aganzhen coal mining area of Gansu Province were officially handed over for production on the 15th. Among them, the Aganzhen Pingdong is currently the largest pair of modern mine shafts in the Northwest.

The Aganzhen Coal Mine is located more than ten kilometers south of Lanzhou and is currently the main fuel base in Gansu Province. Mining in this area began four hundred years ago, but until liberation, the annual output never exceeded 30,000 tons.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 15th: A new pair of modern vertical shafts at the Zaozhuang Coal Mine – the Shanjialin Mine Shafts – were officially handed over for production on the 15th. This pair of vertical shafts is currently the most mechanized mine in Shandong Province. Underground transportation and ground loading have been fully mechanized, and new coal cutting machines are used on the working faces. The coal it produces is of very good quality, and most of it can be used for coking.

This newspaper reports: Another pair of modern large-scale vertical coal mine shafts has begun construction on the "Coal Sea" of Central China – the Pingdingshan Coalfield – on the 5th. This is the sixth pair of mine shafts built by the state in this coal industry base during the First Five-Year Plan period.

Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, December 15th: Another pair of large vertical shafts recently broke ground at the Shiguai Gou Coal Mine. This pair of vertical shafts, with a fully mechanized production process, is the fourth pair of modern mine shafts newly built in this emerging coal industry base in the past three years. The first Pingdong mine shaft to begin construction was put into production in July this year.

The coal reserves in the Shiguai Gou mining area are quite rich, and the quality is also very good, suitable for coking. The coal produced here will mainly supply the needs of the Baotou Iron and Steel United Enterprise in the future. Now, a newly built railway connects it with Baotou.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 15th: The new construction project of Yutianpu No. 2 Mine Shaft in the Nantong mining area of Chongqing officially began on the 15th. After the completion of this pair of mine shafts, it will produce 450,000 tons of coking coal annually, making it the second modern vertical shaft in the Southwest. The Yutianpu No. 2 Mine Shaft was originally scheduled to begin construction during the Second Five-Year Plan period. However, because the water inflow from the aquifer more than 50 meters above the ground is three times greater in the rainy season than in the dry season, starting construction this winter will ensure that the shaft construction can break through the aquifer more than 50 meters above the ground this winter and next spring. This will not only speed up the shaft construction but also save a lot of expenses.

### 煤炭工业的生力军  三对矿井移交生产　三对矿井开工建设

　　煤炭工业的生力军
    三对矿井移交生产　三对矿井开工建设
    据新华社兰州15日电　在甘肃省阿干镇煤矿区兴建的两对矿井，15日正式移交生产。其中阿干镇平峒是目前西北最大的一对现代化矿井。
    阿干镇煤矿在兰州市南面十多公里的地方，是目前甘肃省主要的燃料基地。这个矿区在四百年以前就已进行开采，但是一直到解放前，年产量最多也不到三万吨。
    据新华社济南15日电　枣庄煤矿新建的一对现代化竖井——山家林矿井，15日正式移交生产。这对竖井是目前山东境内机械化程度最高的矿井，井下运搬和地面装车已全部机械化，掌子面上也都用新型的截煤机采煤。它生产的煤炭，质量很好，绝大部分都可以炼焦。
    本报讯　我国中原的“煤海”——平顶山煤田上又有一对现代化大型煤矿竖井，在5日动工兴建。这是第一个五年计划期间国家在这个煤炭工业基地建设的第六对矿井。
    据新华社包头15日电　石拐沟煤矿最近又有一对大型竖井开工建设。这对生产过程全部机械化的竖井，是这个新兴的煤炭工业基地在最近三年来新建的第四对现代化矿井。这个煤矿最先开工的一个平峒，已经在今年7月投入生产。
    石拐沟矿区煤的蕴藏量相当丰富，质量也很好，可以炼焦。这里生产的煤，将来主要供应包头钢铁联合企业的需要。现在，一条新建铁路已把它和包头联系起来。
    据新华社重庆15日电　重庆南桐矿区鱼田堡二号矿井的新建工程在15日正式开工。这对矿井建成后，每年可产四十五万吨炼焦煤，是西南第二座现代化竖井。鱼田堡二号井原定要在第二个五年计划期间开工建设。但是由于这对矿井离地面五十公尺以上的含水层，在雨季的涌水量比少雨季节的涌水量多三倍，提前在今冬开工，便可以保证井筒建设在今冬明春突过五十公尺以上的含水层。这样不仅可以加快建井速度，而且可以节约大量费用。
