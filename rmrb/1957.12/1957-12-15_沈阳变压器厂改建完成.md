　　Shenyang Transformer Factory Renovation Completed
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The renovation of China's largest transformer factory, the Shenyang Transformer Factory, has been completed and put into production on the 12th.
    The factory's renovation project began in 1953, proceeding with construction while maintaining production. The renovation project included thirty engineering projects, including a high-voltage laboratory that is currently the largest in China, a casting workshop, an electroplating workshop, and an oxygen workshop.
    The factory's renovation project was designed by China itself. During the renovation process, it received assistance from fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union, Democratic Germany, and Czechoslovakia.
    Just after liberation, most of the factory's operations were manual, and the maximum capacity of the transformers produced did not exceed 60 kVA. Now it can produce 40,500 kVA, 154,000-volt high-voltage giant transformers. The production capacity, calculated in kVA, has increased more than sevenfold compared to before the renovation.

　　沈阳变压器厂改建完成
    据新华社讯　我国最大的变压器制造厂——沈阳变压器厂已经改建完成，并于12日投入生产。
    这个厂的改建工程是从1953年开始的，一边生产，一边施工。改建工程包括一座我国目前最大的高压试验室和铸造车间、电镀车间、氧气车间等三十个工程项目。
    这个厂的改建工程是我国自己设计的。在改建过程中，得到了苏联、民主德国和捷克斯洛伐克等兄弟国家的帮助。
    刚解放时，这个厂大部由手工操作，生产的变压器最大容量不超过六十仟伏安。现在它已经能生产四万零五百仟伏安、十五万四千伏特的高压巨型变压器。生产能力以仟伏安计算，比改建前提高了七倍多。
