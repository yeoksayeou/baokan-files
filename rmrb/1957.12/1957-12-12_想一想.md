　　Think About It
　　Here's a matchstick game for everyone. When you're resting, you might as well play it with your kids. This game can inspire and cultivate children's thinking ability. All you need to do is find thirty-six matches and arrange them into thirteen squares (as shown in the picture). Think about it, which eight matches should you move to change the thirteen squares into six squares?
