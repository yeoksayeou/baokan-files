　　Must Practice Thrift and Frugality in Managing Household Affairs
    Excerpts from a Speech by Delegate Yang Zhihua (Director of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Women Workers Department)
    Now, I would like to offer some opinions on the issue of implementing thrift and frugality in managing household affairs among workers and their families.

    Since liberation, on the one hand, the Party and the state have shown concern for the lives of workers, increasing their wages and ensuring their welfare on the basis of production development; on the other hand, in the movement for increasing production and practicing economy, not only have the workers actively participated in socialist emulation, striving to complete the state's production tasks, but their families have also been diligently and frugally building their homes, thereby improving the lives of workers to varying degrees. Take the Beijing 401 Factory, where the average wage is not very high, for example, most people have savings, and on average, there is a radio for every four to five households, and a bicycle for every three to four people. According to a survey of 288 worker households in the Chengzi Coal Mine in Beijing, before liberation, there were only eleven watches, twenty-four clocks, and two radios; after liberation, there were seventy watches, two hundred and six clocks, eighty radios, eighty-seven bicycles, and nineteen sewing machines.

    Not long ago, we held discussions with workers at the grassroots level in the 401 Factory, Chengzi Coal Mine, railways, and textiles, and deeply realized that the improvement in the lives of workers in these units is inseparable from their diligent and thrifty attitude towards life.

    At the discussion, we were first impressed by an advanced idea of the workers, which is to closely integrate family interests with national interests. For example, veteran worker Na Changquan from the 401 Factory said: "Only when the country becomes rich and strong can our lives be fundamentally improved. Therefore, I love the factory as my home, and I save for the country in every way in the tailoring department. We also treat our families with the same attitude, living our lives carefully and meticulously." Another veteran worker, Liu Chunde, came from Yan'an, and he deeply understands that our victory today is inseparable from Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy in Yan'an. He said: "I will always remember Chairman Mao's words, and I have continued to maintain the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity after entering the city." Veteran worker Zhang Lirong from the Railway Administration (now promoted to engineer in the Ministry of Railways) said: "Those who have suffered can never forget the hardships of the past." He also often educates his children with this fine quality of the working class, so everyone in his family has developed a habit of loving labor and frugality. The five-year-old child starts doing some odd jobs around the house; the twelve-year-old child learns to make soles and mend socks; Zhang Lirong's wife is the "leader" of seven children, and she takes care of all the children's food and clothing; Zhang Lirong not only respects his wife's housework, but also regards housework as a pleasant thing. He said: "I am not a rest home member of the family, but a capable assistant." Zhang Lirong's personal spending is also carefully calculated, and he is unwilling to make the family's life tight for personal enjoyment. He can not only see today, but also think about tomorrow, and has long-term plans for family life. It is precisely because of the guidance of this advanced idea that these workers' families are not only materially secure, but also mentally happy, the relationship between family members is harmonious, and family expenses and other matters can be discussed together. In other factories and mines, there are many such worker families.

    During the discussion, the workers fully supported the policy of thrift and frugality in managing household affairs. Because they know that thrift and frugality in managing household affairs is of great significance to every worker's family and the entire country. Implementing this policy can not only materially guarantee personal warmth and food, but also solve unexpected family difficulties. Especially for young workers, although their current burden is very light, they will get married and have children in the future. If they can save their surplus money early, they can start a family and raise children. Implementing this policy can also save money for the country. With savings, the country can not only build more factories and improve people's lives, but also deal with natural and man-made disasters with plenty of resources.

    As everyone knows, old China was a long-term backward agricultural country. Although new China has undergone the construction of the first five-year plan, and industry and agriculture have both made great leaps forward, due to the poor foundation of old China, it naturally brings certain difficulties. For example, the supply of grain, coal, water, electricity, and cotton cloth is relatively tight. The living materials of China's 600 million people are mostly consumed through families. Therefore, if every household pays attention to saving every thread, every grain of rice, every unit of electricity, and every inch of cloth, it will be a great force for national construction. Due to the development and deepening of the movement for increasing production and practicing economy, workers' families in various places have responded to the call for saving grain, coal, water, electricity, and cloth ("five savings"), making great contributions to the country. The families of 14,000 workers in six factories in Taiyuan saved more than 221,000 jin of grain from January to August this year; the families of 3,000 workers in Kailuan Coal Mine saved 1.49 million jin of coal in the recent three months; the families of workers in Longfeng Mine in Fushun repaired and altered old work clothes, saving more than 35,000 chi of cotton cloth; and the families of workers in the Fifth Mine of Pingxiang Coal Mine saved 24,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity in the third quarter of this year. Their actions are a concrete manifestation of loving the country, loving the family, and loving socialism. This is worthy of learning for every worker and family member. In order to better improve the family life of workers, to accumulate more funds for our country, and to ensure the smooth implementation of the national economic plan, we must continue to widely and deeply implement the central government's policy of thrift and frugality in managing household affairs. How to implement this policy?

    First of all, we should carry out extensive and in-depth publicity and education so that every worker and family member has a correct understanding of the relationship between building the country through diligence and thrift, managing household affairs through diligence and thrift, and their interrelationship in ideology. According to a survey of 2,848 worker households in Tangjiazhuang, Kailuan Coal Mine, those who can live frugally account for 20% of the total number of worker households, those who have a general plan account for 73%, and those who are not good at planning and arranging account for 7%. This shows that worker families are basically diligent and thrifty. Especially the workers who came from the old society do a better job. However, we should also see that due to the continuous expansion of the working class in recent years, some new workers and family members come from the petty bourgeoisie or even from the exploiting classes. These people more or less bring non-proletarian ideologies and bad habits of extravagance and waste, which also affect some workers. They compare eating and dressing, but not labor. In addition, some young workers, although they accept new things quickly and play a big role in production, have not suffered in the old society, "do not know the price of firewood and rice," and spend money without a plan, paying attention to ostentation in love and marriage. When the old workers cannot stand their extravagant spending and give them advice and criticism, they retort: "Are you trying to pull us back to the old society?" Some workers think: "In the past, we saved money for our children to go to school, but now the state is training them anyway; in the past, there was no way to deal with illness or old age, but now there is labor insurance anyway; who cares!" Some workers think: "The money is earned by me, I should spend it; if I have difficulties, the state should solve them." Some workers think: "A blade of grass has a drop of dew to nourish it, and the blind bird will naturally be taken care of by God, so there is no need to worry." They push the responsibilities they should bear to the state. The above-mentioned ideas are not in line with the spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift and managing household affairs through diligence and thrift, and are detrimental to both the individual and the country. We should carry out publicity and education work to let them know that the realization of socialist industrialization depends on the accumulation of funds from the savings of the people across the country, bit by bit, and cannot sit back and enjoy the benefits; let them know and remember the hard life of the past, and carry forward the glorious tradition of hard work and frugality of the working class, "can not forget the pain after the scar is healed."

    In addition to carrying out educational work, trade union organizations should also support and organize workers' families to participate in various sideline productions as much as possible, according to the needs of production and the requirements of the masses, to increase income, improve family life, reduce the state's relief expenditure, and ease the tension of supply. For example, more than 2,500 families in Xiangxi Tungsten Mine reclaimed wasteland, planted vegetables, and planted miscellaneous grains last year, and 80% of the workers' families achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables, and 90% of the workers' families had savings. There were originally 797 households in difficulty in 12 factories in Jinan, requiring a relief of 9,467 yuan. Since the organization of families to engage in sideline production, the number of households in difficulty has been reduced by 40%, and the relief expenditure has been reduced by 60%. This shows that diligent production is of great benefit to the country and the individual.

    Under the policy of implementing thrift and frugality in managing household affairs, many places not only carefully calculate and arrange life for each household, but also use the collective strength of the masses to solve the difficulties in the family life of workers. For example, in the past few years, workers' families have used mutual assistance and mutual aid methods to take care of women in childbirth, patients, handle weddings and funerals, move houses, buy coal, transport grain, organize nurseries and kindergartens, and organize savings mutual assistance, etc., which has played a great role. This is a new phenomenon produced under the socialist system, and it is also a manifestation of the collectivist essence of the working class. It is essentially different from the idea of "everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door" in the old society. This collectivist spirit of the working class is worthy of cherishing and promoting.

    The more difficult problems in workers' lives are diseases and multiple children. Among the 439 people who received difficulty subsidies in Beijing State Cotton No. 2 Factory in the first half of this year, 41% were subsidized due to illness or death of workers and their families. Therefore, trade unions must organize workers and their families to actively participate in the patriotic health movement, eliminate mosquitoes and flies, fill ditches and repair canals, and green residential areas to improve the environment and family hygiene; and promote maternal and child health and family planning to improve the health of workers and their families and ensure the normal attendance of workers, in order to reduce family economic expenditures.

    Thrift and frugality in managing household affairs is not only the task of workers' families, but also the responsibility of all our workers, and it is also what our cadres should take the lead in doing. Our country is a big country with a large population. To build our country into an advanced industrial country, we need everyone to work hard. Comrade Liu Shaoqi instructed us: "The Chinese people should have ambition, should cheer up, and adhere to the fine style of hard work and thrift, so that in the next few decades, we can build our country into a rich and strong country in the world." Our working class is ambitious. We should actively respond to the call of the Party, strive to implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift and managing household affairs through diligence and thrift, and play a model role among residents. We should continue to carry forward the fine tradition of hard work of the working class and strive to build our motherland!

　　必须勤俭持家
    杨之华代表（全总女工部部长）发言摘要
    现在，我仅就在职工和家属群众中贯彻勤俭持家的问题提出一些意见。
    解放以来，一方面由于党和国家对职工生活的关怀，在生产发展的基础上，提高了职工的工资，保证了职工的福利；一方面，在增产节约运动中，不仅职工群众积极地参加社会主义竞赛，为完成国家生产任务而奋斗，其家属也在勤劳节俭地建设着自己的家庭，从而，使职工的生活获得了不同程度的改善。就拿平均工资不太高的北京401工厂来说，多数人也是有积蓄的，全体工人平均每四户至五户有一个收音机，三个人至四个人有一辆自行车。根据北京城子煤矿二百八十八户职工家庭的调查，解放以前，只有十一个手表、二十四个钟和两个收音机；解放以后，有七十个手表、二百零六个钟、八十个收音机、八十七辆自行车和十九台缝纫机。
    不久以前，我们曾经和401工厂、城子煤矿、铁路和纺织基层的职工进行了座谈，深深体会到这些单位的职工生活所以得到改善，和他们以勤劳节俭的态度对待生活是分不开的。
    在座谈会上，首先使我们接触到的是工人的一种先进思想，这就是把家庭利益和国家利益紧密地结合在一起。如401工厂老工人那长全同志说：“只有国家富强起来，才能从根本上改善我们的生活。所以，我爱厂如家，我在裁剪部门工作处处为国家节约。我们也以同样的态度对待家庭，精打细算地过日子。”另一个老工人刘春德同志是从延安出来的，他深深体会到今天我们取得胜利，与毛主席在延安号召增产节约是分不开的。他说：“我永远记着毛主席的话，进城以后，继续保持了艰苦朴素的优良传统。”铁路管理局一位老工人张立荣同志（现在提升为铁道部的工程师）说：“受过苦的人，永远忘不了过去的苦难日子。”他并且经常以这种工人阶级的优良品质教育孩子，因此，在他的家庭里，每个人都养成了爱劳动和俭朴的习惯。五岁的孩子就开始操作一些零星的家务劳动；十二岁的孩子学会了纳鞋底补袜子；张立荣同志的妻子是七个孩子的“团长”，所有孩子的吃穿都由她操劳；张立荣同志不仅尊重妻子的家务劳动，自己也把家务劳动看成是愉快的事情，他说：“我不是家庭的休养员，而是家庭的得力助手。”张立荣同志的个人用钱也是精打细算的，他不愿意为个人的享受使全家生活紧张。他不仅能看到今天，而且还能想到明天，对家庭生活有长远打算。正是由于这种先进思想的指导，这些工人的家庭不仅在物质上有了保证，而且在精神上也很愉快，家庭成员间感情很融洽，家庭的开支以及其他事情都能作到共同商量。在其他厂矿企业里，像这样的工人家庭还是很多的。
    在座谈中，职工对勤俭持家的方针是十分拥护的。因为他们知道，勤俭持家对每一个职工的家庭以及整个国家的意义都非常重大。贯彻这个方针，不仅可以在物质上保证个人的穿暖吃饱，而且可以解决家庭的意外困难。尤其是青年职工，眼前负担虽然很轻，但将来要结婚、生孩子，如果能够及早把多余的钱积蓄起来，就可以成家立业，抚育子女。贯彻这个方针，也可以给国家节约。国家有了积蓄，不仅可以多办工厂，改善人民生活，而且可以充裕地应付天灾人祸。
    大家都知道，旧中国是一个长期落后的农业国，新中国虽然经过第一个五年计划的建设，工业、农业都有了飞跃的发展，但是，由于旧中国的底子穷，很自然地带来了一定的困难。如粮食、煤炭、水电和棉布的供应都比较紧张。我国六亿人口的生活资料大部分是通过家庭来消费的。因此，如果家家户户都注意一针一线、一把米、一度电和一寸布的节约，对于国家建设就是一种莫大的力量。由于增产节约运动的开展和深入，各地职工家属纷纷响应了节约粮、煤、水、电、布“五节”的号召，对国家作出了巨大的贡献。太原六个工厂一万四千户职工家属，今年1到8月就节约了二十二万一千多斤粮食；开滦煤矿三千户职工家属在最近三个月内节约了煤一百四十九万斤；抚顺龙凤矿的职工家属翻改修补旧工作服，节约了棉布三万五千多尺；萍乡煤矿五矿职工家属在今年第三季度就节约了电二万四千度。他们这种行动，是爱国、爱家、爱社会主义的具体表现。这是值得我们每一个职工和家属学习的。为了更好地改善职工的家庭生活，为了给我们国家积累更多的资金，为了保证国家经济计划的顺利执行，我们必须继续广泛地深入地贯彻中央提出的勤俭持家的方针。怎样贯彻这个方针呢？
    首先，应该进行广泛而深入的宣传教育，使每个职工和家属在思想上对勤俭建国、勤俭持家和它们的相互关系，有个正确的认识。根据开滦煤矿唐家庄二千八百四十八户职工家庭的调查，能够勤俭过日子的占职工家庭总数的20％，一般有计划的占73％，不善于计划和安排的占7％。这说明，职工家庭基本上是勤劳节俭的。特别是从旧社会过来的工人，更做得好。但是，我们也应该看到，由于工人阶级队伍几年来不断地扩大，有一些新工人和家属来自小资产阶级甚至出身于剥削阶级。这些人或多或少地带来了非无产阶级的思想意识，以及铺张浪费的坏作风，这些坏作风也影响了一部分工人，他们比吃比穿，不比劳动。另外有一些青年工人，虽然他们接受新事物快，在生产上起了很大的作用。但由于没有在旧社会受过苦，“不当家不知柴米贵”，花钱没计划，恋爱、结婚讲排场。当老工人看不惯他们这种乱花钱的现象，给以劝告和批评时，他们却反感地说：“难道你们要把我们拉回旧社会去吗？”有的职工认为：“从前存钱为子女上学，现在反正有国家培养；从前病了、老了没办法，现在反正有劳保；管它呢！”有的职工认为：“钱是我挣的，我该花；我有困难，国家就该解决。”有的职工认为：“一根草有一粒露水养，瞎眼鸟自有天照应，用不着操心。”他们把个人应负的责任，一起推给国家。上述思想，都不符合勤俭建国和勤俭持家的精神，对个人对国家都是不利的。我们应该向这些同志进行宣传教育工作，让他们知道：实现社会主义工业化，要依靠全国人民一点一滴地节约来积累资金，不能坐享现成；让他们知道和记住过去的艰苦生活，发扬工人阶级勤劳节俭的光荣传统，“不能好了疮疤忘了痛。”
    工会组织除了进行教育工作以外，还应根据生产的需要和群众的要求，尽可能地支持和组织职工家属参加各种副业生产，来增加收入，改善家庭生活，减少国家救济费的开支和缓和供应的紧张。如湘西钨矿的二千五百多户家属，去年开荒、种菜、种杂粮，80％的职工家庭作到了蔬菜自给，90％的职工家庭有了积蓄。济南十二个工厂原有七百九十七个困难户，需要救济九千四百六十七元，自从组织家属搞副业后，困难户减少了40％，救济费减少了60％。这都说明了勤劳生产对国家和个人的利益是很大的。
    在贯彻勤俭持家的方针下，许多地方不仅是一家一户精打细算、安排生活，而且还以群众集体的力量来解决职工家庭生活中的困难。例如几年来职工家属以互助互济的办法，照顾产妇、病人，办理婚丧大事，搬家，买煤，运粮，组织托儿站、幼儿园，组织储金互助等，发挥了很大的作用。这是在社会主义制度下，产生出来的新气象，也是工人阶级集体主义本质的表现，它和旧社会的“各人自扫门前雪”的思想有着本质上的不同。这种工人阶级的集体主义精神是值得珍贵和提倡的。
    在职工生活中较困难的问题是疾病和多子女的问题。北京国棉二厂今年上半年得到困难补助的四百三十九人中，因职工及家属生病或者死亡而补助的就占41％。因此，工会必须组织职工家属群众积极参加爱国卫生运动，消灭蚊蝇，填沟修渠，绿化住宅，以改善环境和家庭的卫生；并推行妇幼卫生和计划生育，增进职工和家属的健康，保证职工的正常出勤，以减少家庭经济的开支。
    勤俭持家，不仅是职工家属的任务，也是我们全体职工的责任，也是我们干部应该以身作则的。我们的国家是一个大国，人口又多，要把我国建设成为先进的工业国，就需大家来努力。刘少奇同志指示我们：“中国人民应当有志气，应当振作精神，坚持勤劳节约的优良作风，以便在最近几十年内把我国建设成为世界上一个富强的国家。”我们工人阶级是有志气的。我们应该积极响应党的号召，努力贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭持家的方针，并且在居民中起模范作用。我们应该继续发扬工人阶级艰苦奋斗的优良传统，为建设我们的祖国而努力！
