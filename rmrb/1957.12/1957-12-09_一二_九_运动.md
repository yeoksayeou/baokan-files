The December 9th Movement

Twenty-two years ago, China was on the eve of a great historical turning point. Following the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, Japanese imperialism became even more aggressive, extending its tentacles of invasion from the Northeast to North China. The reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek, on the one hand, implemented a policy of non-resistance to the Japanese invaders, continuously signing humiliating treaties such as the "Tanggu Truce" and the "He-Umezu Agreement," and ordering "amicable relations" and the "suppression of anti-Japanese" activities; on the other hand, it ignored the Chinese Communist Party's patriotic proposal for a united front against Japan, and continued to "encircle and suppress" the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army domestically. In 1935, the situation in North China was extremely tense. Under the manipulation of the Japanese invaders, pro-Japanese elements and traitors were playing out puppet farces: the traitor Yin Rugeng announced the establishment of the "Jidong Anti-Communist Autonomous Region," Beijing was brewing the "North China Five Provinces Autonomy" movement, and the "Hebei-Chahar Political Council" was about to be established... A dark cloud was pressing down on the hearts of every conscientious Chinese person. It could no longer be tolerated!

The Chinese Communist Party's "August 1st Declaration" shone like a bright light, illuminating people's eyes. The Party called for an end to the civil war, unity against Japan, and the salvation of the nation. The August 1st Declaration stated: "...Resisting Japan and saving the nation has become the sacred duty of every compatriot!" Under the direct leadership of the Party, the "December 9th Movement" erupted in Beijing.

On December 9, 1935, Beijing was sealed off in the bitter cold. Driven by patriotic enthusiasm, Beijing students with boiling blood in their veins took to the streets. They were not intimidated by the reactionary forces' bloody suppression. The marching ranks broke through the obstruction of the puppet military police, seized the water cannons that attacked them head-on, and, braving the threat of whips, broadswords, and rifles, marched along the streets, stepping on the blood of their wounded classmates, shouting: "Down with Japanese imperialism!" "Down with the traitorous bandits!" Singing heroic songs: "Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!..." Tens of thousands of students gathered in front of Xinhuamen, petitioning He Yingqin, Chiang Kai-shek's representative in Beijing, without result. On the 10th, all schools declared a general strike. After a week of preparation, an even larger parade and demonstration was held on December 16th. As news spread, students in Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and all over the country rose up in response, and quickly expanded to include workers, citizens, and other patriotic elements. The anti-Japanese flames ignited by Beijing students swept the country, attracting worldwide attention. The "December 9th Movement" broke through the dark reactionary rule and became the prelude to the War of Resistance Against Japan.

During the "December 9th Movement," the students raised a question: How to resist Japan and save the country? What forces to rely on to defeat Japanese imperialism and overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang? The wise Chinese Communist Party told them: the workers and peasants are the main force, and educated youth must go to the masses of workers and peasants to mobilize them. The Party pointed out the path of combining with workers and peasants. Shortly after the "December 16th" parade, the slogan "Go to the countryside" was raised. The then Peking Student Union formed the "Southward Expansion Propaganda Group," and many students went to the countryside to preach the principles of resisting Japan and saving the country to the peasants. Young students trudged through the countryside on foot in snow and ice, their scarves covered in frost from their breath, sleeping in their clothes on straw and earthen beds at night. The next morning, they would not even wash their faces, and after eating flatbread and pickles, they would embark on the dusty roads again. At first, the peasants did not understand, thinking that these "foreign students" were there to "preach," because they spoke in a student accent that was different from the language of the common people. Finally, the students and peasants broke down the barriers. The villagers understood the principles of resisting Japan and saving the country, and the students began to understand the situation in the countryside. The peasants talked about tenancy relations, the cruel exploitation of landlords, and so on, which made many students who grew up in luxurious urban families open their eyes in surprise. They began to care about the suffering of the people and began to realize that in order to achieve the anti-imperialist task, it was also necessary to oppose feudalism. The propaganda in the countryside lasted for three weeks and ended due to obstruction and sabotage by reactionary military police, but the students sowed the seeds of resistance against Japan in the countryside, and also raised their own revolutionary awareness. Many people realized that it was necessary to go deep into the masses of workers and peasants and unite with workers and peasants to fight against the enemy.

After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, a large-scale movement of revolutionary educated youth combining with workers and peasants emerged. A large number of young students who participated in the "December 9th Movement" crossed mountains and plains and gathered in Yan'an. They joined the workers' and peasants' armies—the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army—participated in the work of the guerrillas and anti-Japanese base areas, and under the leadership of the Party, fought against the Japanese invaders together with the workers and peasants, and were transformed and tempered in the process, shouldering the great mission of the Chinese people's revolution.

The "December 9th Movement" was a manifestation of the awakening of the Chinese nation, and was a patriotic, revolutionary, and epoch-making mass movement under the leadership of the Party; at the same time, it set a brilliant example for the combination of Chinese educated youth and workers and peasants. The "December 9th Movement" pointed out a truth: only when intellectuals are determined to combine with workers and peasants and serve them can they become true revolutionaries.

Now, our motherland is undergoing another greater and more profound historical turning point, and the people of the whole country are carrying out a vigorous socialist revolution and socialist construction. The Party has once again issued a solemn call to intellectuals to temper and transform themselves in labor. At such a time, it is very beneficial for every young intellectual to review the historical experiences and lessons, as it will help us recognize the extreme importance of participating in physical labor and transforming our thinking. The generation of Chinese intellectuals should inherit the glorious revolutionary tradition of the youth of the "December 9th" era, and be determined to cultivate and transform themselves into working-class intellectuals.

### “一二·九”运动

　　“一二·九”运动
    二十二年前，中国正处在一个伟大的历史转折的前夕。继1931年“九·一八”之后，日本帝国主义得寸进尺，侵略的魔掌从东北伸向华北。蒋介石反动政府一方面对日寇实行不抵抗主义的卖国政策，连续和日本签订了“塘沽协定”、“何梅协定”等丧权辱国的条约，并且下令“睦邻”和“取缔排日”活动；另一方面，不理会中国共产党提出的联合抗日的爱国主张，在国内继续“围剿”工农红军。1935年，华北局势极度紧张。在日寇操纵下，国民党亲日派和汉奸们正扮演着一幕幕的傀儡丑戏：汉奸殷汝耕宣告成立“冀东防共自治区”，北京酝酿着“华北五省自治”运动，“冀察政务委员会”即将成立……一片阴黑的云雾，压在每个有良心的中国人的心头。再也不能忍受！
    中国共产党的“八一宣言”，像一股慧亮的火光，照亮了人们的眼睛。党号召停止内战，一致抗日，挽救民族危亡。八一宣言上写着：“……抗日救国，已经成为每个同胞的神圣天职！”在党的直接领导下，北京爆发了“一二·九”运动。
    1935年12月9日，北京被封锁在严寒里。为爱国热情所激荡，胸中奔腾着热血的北京学生，走上了街头。他们并没有为反动派的血腥镇压所吓倒，游行队伍冲破伪军警的阻拦，夺下迎面袭来的水龙，冒着皮鞭、大刀、步枪的威胁踏着受伤同学的血迹，沿街奔走呼号：“打倒日本帝国主义！”“打倒汉奸卖国贼！”唱着雄壮的歌曲：“起来，不愿做奴隶的人们！……”成万名学生聚集在新华门前，向蒋介石驻北京代表何应钦请愿，毫无结果。10日，各校宣布总罢课，经过一周的准备，在12月16日举行了规模更大的游行示威。消息传出，天津、上海、武汉、广州，全国各地学生纷纷起来响应，而且迅速地扩展到工人、市民和其他爱国分子阶层。北京学生点燃起来的抗日烽火，漫卷全国，引起了全世界的注意。“一二·九”运动突破了阴暗的反动统治，成为抗日战争的序幕。
    “一二·九”运动中，学生们发生了一个疑问：怎样来进行抗日救国？依靠什么力量来打倒日本帝国主义、推翻国民党的反动统治？英明的中国共产党告诉他们：工农是主力军，知识青年一定要到工农群众中去，把工农大众动员起来。党给他们指出了和工农结合的道路。“一二·一六”游行后不久，“到农村去”的口号响起来了。由当时的北平学联组成了“南下扩大宣传团”，许多学生到农村去，向农民宣传抗日救国的道理。青年学生们踏着冰雪，徒步奔走在农村，围巾上凝结着嘘气的霜花，夜晚和衣睡在稻草上、土炕上，第二天清早连脸也不洗，吃完大饼咸菜，又踏上浮土满扬的大道。农民们开始不了解，以为这些“洋学生”是来“传教的”，因为他们满口学生腔，和老百姓的语言不一样。终于，学生和农民打破了隔阂，老乡们懂得了抗日救国的道理，学生们也开始了解了农村的情况。农民谈到租佃关系、地主的残酷剥削等，使得许多生长在城市豪华家庭的学生，惊讶得睁大了眼睛。他们开始关心民间疾苦，开始悟解到在实现反帝任务的同时，还必须反封建。下乡宣传进行了三个星期，由于被反动军警阻挠破坏而告结束，但是学生们却在农村播下了抗日的种子，并且提高了自己的革命觉悟，许多人认识到必须深入工农群众，和工人农民结合在一起向敌人进行斗争。
    抗日战争开始后，一个规模宏大的革命知识青年与工农结合的运动出现了。大批的参加“一二·九”运动的青年学生，越过高山跨过平原，向延安汇集。他们参加工农的军队——八路军和新四军，参加游击队和抗日根据地的工作，在党的领导下，和工农劳动人民一起进行抗击日本侵略者的斗争，并在其中得到改造和锻炼，担负起中国人民革命的伟大使命。
    “一二·九”运动是中华民族觉醒的表现，是在党的领导下爱国的、革命的、划时代的群众运动；它同时为中国知识青年与工农结合做出了光辉的榜样。“一二·九”运动指出了一条真理：知识分子只有下决心实行与工农结合、为工农服务，才能成为真正的革命者。
    现在，我们祖国正经历着另一个更伟大更深刻的历史转折，全国人民正进行着轰轰烈烈的社会主义革命和社会主义建设。党又向知识分子发出了在劳动中锻炼改造自己的庄严号召。在这样的时刻，每个知识青年重温一下历史的经验教训是很有益处的，它将会帮助我们认识参加体力劳动和改造思想的极端重要性。中国这一代的知识青年应该继承“一二·九”时代青年的光荣革命的传统，下决心把自己培养和改造成工人阶级的劳动知识分子。　（田）（附图片）
