    "Baby Grass" - Sweet Clover
    The sweet clover, hailed as "baby grass" by the masses, exhibited at the ongoing Second National Soil and Water Conservation Work Conference, has attracted great attention from representatives from various regions.
    Sweet clover can conserve water and soil, prevent wind and fix sand, improve soil, and solve the difficulties of fuel, feed, and fertilizer shortages for people in mountainous areas. Its stems can be drawn into hemp-like fibers, the seeds can be used to make wine, and the flowers can be used for large-scale beekeeping. Sweet clover was originally a wild legume plant in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. In recent years, after it has been gradually promoted and planted in provinces such as Shaanxi, Gansu, and Shanxi, it has proven to be a high-value and rapidly profitable superior grass species. According to experiments conducted by the Suide Soil and Water Conservation Science Experiment Station in Shaanxi, planting sweet clover on a 34-degree slope reduced erosion by 66% and runoff by 14% compared to farmland with a 28-degree slope, demonstrating its significant effect on soil and water conservation.
    Sweet clover has characteristics such as cold resistance, drought resistance, and alkali resistance. It can be planted in barren mountains, deep ravines, or steep cliffs and can be sown in all seasons. It grows quickly, with tall and upright stems, about two to three meters high, and a developed root system, with roots reaching more than two meters in length.
    Now, sweet clover has begun to be welcomed by the majority of farmers in mountainous areas. Many places have made vigorous promotion of sweet clover planting an important measure for soil and water conservation, improving agricultural production, and increasing the income of people in mountainous areas.

    “宝贝草”——草木樨
    正在召开的第二次全国水土保持工作会议展出的一种被群众誉为“宝贝草”的草木樨，引起各地代表极大注意。
    草木樨可以蓄水保土、防风固沙、改良土壤和解决山区人民缺少燃料、饲料、肥料的困难；它的茎秆可以抽出像麻样的纤维，种籽还可制酒，花可供大量养蜂用。草木樨原是黄河中游的一种野生豆科植物，几年来在陕西、甘肃、山西等省逐步推广种植以后，证明是一种经济价值很高和收益很快的优良草类。据陕西绥德水土保持科学试验站的试验，在三十四度坡地上种植草木樨，比二十八度的农作物地减少冲刷66％，减少径流14％，证明对保持水土有显著作用。
    草木樨具有耐寒、耐旱和抗盐碱等特性，不论荒山深壑或陡坡峻崖，都可种植，四季都能播种。它生长迅速，茎秆高大直立，约二到三公尺，根群发达，立根长达两公尺以上。
    现在，草木樨已开始受到广大山区农民的欢迎，许多地方已把大力推广种植草木樨，作为水土保持、提高农业生产和增加山区人民收入的重要措施之一。
