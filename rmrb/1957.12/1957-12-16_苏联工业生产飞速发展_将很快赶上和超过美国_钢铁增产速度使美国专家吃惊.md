Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 15th: A recent article in "Pravda" stated that in the peaceful economic competition, the Soviet Union possesses all the conditions to quickly catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of industrial product output.

The article pointed out that in the next fifteen years, the Soviet Union will increase its production of pig iron, steel, and wool fabrics by two to two and a half times, iron ore by three to three and a half times, oil by three and a half to four times, electricity by three and eight-tenths to four and three-tenths times, coal by one and four-tenths to one and six-tenths times, cement by three to four times, and gas by thirteen to fifteen times, at a rate unprecedented in capitalist industry.

The article pointed out that after decades of rapid development since the October Revolution, the gap between the Soviet Union and the United States in the output of some of the most important industrial products has been greatly reduced. For example, in 1928, at the beginning of the first Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union only mined 6.1 million tons of iron ore, while the United States mined more than 60 million tons, meaning that the Soviet Union's iron ore production was only one-tenth of that of the United States. However, the Soviet Union's iron ore mining volume is now approaching that of the United States and will surpass it in the coming years to rank first in the world. In 1928, the Soviet Union's pig iron production was only 3.2 million tons, while the United States had 38.7 million tons, which is more than ten times that of the Soviet Union; in terms of steel production, the United States even produced more than eleven times that of the Soviet Union at that time. But now, the United States produces less than twice as much pig iron as the Soviet Union, and only about twice as much steel. Currently, the United States' oil production is three and a half times that of the Soviet Union, and electricity production is three times that of the Soviet Union, but twenty-nine years ago, the Soviet Union's oil production was less than one-tenth of that of the United States, and electricity production was only a little over 2% of that of the United States.

These situations demonstrate that the Soviet Union is rapidly catching up with and will surpass the United States in terms of the output of the most important industrial products.

The article also stated that increasing the production of decisive industrial products by two to three times in the next ten years or so and further developing agricultural production will greatly improve the living standards of the Soviet people. As everyone knows, the Soviet Union's wheat and sugar production have already surpassed those of the United States, and now it is striving to catch up with and surpass it in the production of milk, meat, and fats per capita in the next few years. In addition, the Soviet Union's wool fabric production is now closely approaching the level of the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: According to TASS, New York: "Russia is catching up with the United States in steel production" - this is the title of a recent issue of the American "Business Week" in its report on the rapid development of the Soviet metallurgical industry.

"Business Week," based on a report prepared for the U.S. State Department by metallurgical expert Dr. Dennis Carney, who recently visited the Soviet Union and toured Soviet metallurgical plants, wrote that the Soviet Union "is expanding the production capacity of the metallurgical industry at a breakneck speed, a speed that is simply astonishing compared to our own, even though our production is now expanding faster than in the past."

The magazine pointed out that the Soviet Union has doubled its steel production in seven years and is now "going all out" to double the production capacity of steel mills again.

The magazine continued, "Russia has already overtaken us in blast furnace ironmaking." Soviet large blast furnaces produce 2,400 to 2,500 tons of pig iron per day, while the best American blast furnaces produce only 2,000 to 2,100 tons per day.

The magazine had to admit: "The Russians have not only greatly surpassed the United States in practice," but also "are designing blast furnaces that can enable them to achieve even better results." The Soviet Union is "not only determined to overtake the United States," but also "can do it."

### 苏联工业生产飞速发展  将很快赶上和超过美国  钢铁增产速度使美国专家吃惊

　　苏联工业生产飞速发展  将很快赶上和超过美国
    钢铁增产速度使美国专家吃惊
    新华社莫斯科15日电　“真理报”最近发表的一篇文章说，在和平经济竞赛中，苏联拥有一切条件在工业产品产量上很快地赶上和超过美国。
    文章指出，在今后十五年中，苏联将以资本主义工业从未有过的速度把生铁、钢和毛织品产量分别增加为二倍到二点三倍，铁矿砂增加为三倍到三倍半，石油增加为三倍半到四倍，电力增加为三点八倍到四点三倍，煤增加为一点四倍到一点六倍，水泥增加为三倍到四倍，煤气增加为十三倍到十五倍。
    文章指出，经过十月革命后几十年的迅速发展，苏联一些最重要的工业品产量同美国的差额已经大大缩小了。例如，在第一个五年计划开始时的1928年，苏联只开采了六百一十万吨铁矿砂，而美国则开采了六千多万吨，也就是说当时苏联的铁矿砂产量只占美国的十分之一。然而，苏联的铁矿开采量目前已经接近美国，而且将在最近几年超过它而居世界第一位。1928年，苏联的生铁产量只有三百二十万吨，而美国则有三千八百七十万吨，即等于苏联的十倍多；在钢产量上，当时美国甚至比苏联多十一倍以上。而现在，美国的生铁产量比苏联多不到一倍了，钢产量只大约多一倍。目前，美国的石油产量等于苏联的三倍半，电力产量等于苏联的三倍，但是在二十九年前，苏联的石油产量还占不到美国的十分之一，电力产量只占美国2％多一点。
    这些情况说明，苏联在最重要的工业产品产量方面正在迅速追上并且将超过美国。
    文章还说，把有决定意义的工业品生产在最近十多年中增加为二倍到三倍并且使农业生产进一步发展起来，这将大大提高苏联人民的生活水平。大家知道，苏联的小麦和糖产量已经超过了美国，而现在正在争取在最近几年内在按人口计算的奶类、肉类和油脂的产量上也赶上和超过它。另外，苏联的毛织品产量现在已经紧紧地接近美国水平了。
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：“俄国在钢的生产上正在赶过美国”——这是最近一期美国“商业周刊”在报道苏联冶金工业的迅速发展时的一个标题。
    “商业周刊”根据不久前到过苏联并且参观过苏联的冶金工厂的冶金专家丹尼斯·卡尼博士为美国国务院准备的一份报告写道，苏联“在以飞快的速度扩大冶金工业的生产能力，这样的速度同我国的速度比较起来简直令人吃惊，尽管我们的生产现在比过去扩大得要快。”
    杂志指出，苏联在七年间使钢的生产增加了一倍，现在正在“全力以赴”，使炼钢厂的生产能力再增加一倍。
    这家杂志继续说，“俄国在高炉炼铁方面已经赶过我们。”苏联的大高炉每昼夜生产二千四百至二千五百吨生铁，而最好的美国高炉每昼夜只生产二千至二千一百吨。
    这家杂志不得不承认：“俄国人不仅在实践上已经大大超过了美国”，而且“正在设计可以使他们达到更好的结果的高炉”。苏联“不仅满怀决心赶过美国”，而且“能够作到这一点”。
