Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 30th -- Liaoning Industrial Base, one of China's important industrial bases, has completed the industrial production and construction plan of the first Five-Year Plan. The total industrial output value of the province is expected to exceed the provisions of the first Five-Year Plan by 27% by the end of the year; basic construction will exceed the plan by 12.1%; of the projects above the limit stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan, 110 have already been put into production, and it is expected that 120 will be completed by the end of the year. This was mentioned by Li Tao, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in his report to the Second Session of the First Congress of the Communist Party of China in Liaoning Province.

Li Tao said that during the first Five-Year Plan period, due to the technical transformation of old enterprises and the improvement and construction of a large number of new enterprises, the industrial face of Liaoning Province has been greatly improved, and productivity has been improved. Taking the output of several major products as an example: pig iron production increased by 262.5% compared with 1952, steel products increased by 249.6%, steel production increased by 327%, raw coal production increased by 89.4%, power generation increased by 154.2%, and cement production increased by 116.7%. Compared with 1952, the province's total industrial output value increased by 150% in 1957, and by 850% compared with 1949; the proportion of industrial output value in the province's total industrial and agricultural output value has increased from 72% in 1952 to 85%.

Li Tao said that the future task of industrial and mining enterprises in Liaoning Province should be to give full play to the role of the old industrial base, further utilize the production capacity of existing and newly built industries, on the one hand, to produce more and better new products to accelerate the country's industrialization, and on the other hand, all industrial production and design departments must actively study, design and manufacture various new products to promote agricultural production and vigorously serve the development of agriculture. Li Tao also proposed that the central task of Liaoning Province's industrial, basic construction, and transportation enterprises next year is to consolidate and expand the achievements of the rectification movement, further promote socialist democracy, fully mobilize and organize the broad masses of workers, and fully implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and fully implementing the policies of more, faster, better, more economical, and safer production, carrying out socialist competitions centered on increasing production and practicing economy, welcoming and promoting the new upsurge of socialist production and construction that has arrived, and striving to complete the national plan and the plan for increasing production and practicing economy.

Li Tao said that in the past year, Liaoning Province has implemented and executed the central government's policy of overcoming difficulties in every possible way in leading the movement to increase production and practice economy, and has taken several measures to achieve this policy. However, the systematic and timely criticism and correction of passive and conservative ideas is not enough. The production potential of enterprises has not yet been fully tapped. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, fully carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, give full play to equipment capacity, and strive to increase production. All enterprises with low equipment utilization rates should learn from and promote the experience of advanced enterprises in improving equipment efficiency, and take active measures to make the equipment utilization rate of their own enterprises reach the advanced level; all enterprises with high raw material consumption should learn from and promote the advanced experience of saving raw materials, take active measures to improve the utilization rate of raw materials, improve quality, and reduce the scrap rate. In terms of the welfare of workers, we should advocate spending less money and doing more things, and rely on the masses to run welfare undertakings. At the same time, we should improve technology, improve technology, and promote technology in all enterprises, and strive to produce more and better products.

　　工业总产值增加一倍半　一百一十项基建项目投入生产
　　辽宁提前完成五年生产建设计划
    新华社沈阳30日电　我国重要工业基地之一——辽宁工业基地，已经完成第一个五年计划的工业生产和建设计划。全省工业总产值预计到年底将超过第一个五年计划规定27％；基本建设将超过计划12.1％；第一个五年计划中规定的限额以上的工程，现在已经有一百一十项投入生产，预计到年底能完成一百二十项。这是中共辽宁省委书记李涛在中共辽宁省第一届代表大会第二次会议上所作的报告中谈到的。
    李涛说，在第一个五年计划期间，由于对旧企业进行了技术改造，改进并且兴建了大批新企业，因而大大改善了辽宁省工业的面貌，提高了生产力。以几种主要产品、产量为例：生铁产量比1952年提高262.5％，钢的产品已提高249.6％，钢材产量提高327％，原煤产量提高89.4％，发电量提高154.2％，水泥产量提高116.7％。1957年同1952年相比，全省工业总产值增加一倍半，比1949年增加八倍半；全省工农业总产值中的工业产值比重，已由1952年72％上升到85％。
    李涛说，辽宁省工矿企业今后的任务，应当充分发挥老工业基地的作用，进一步利用原有工业和新建工业的生产能力，一方面生产更多、更好的新产品，加速国家的工业化，另方面各工业生产和设计部门都要积极研究设计和制造促进农业生产发展的各种新产品，大力为发展农业服务。李涛同时提出：明年辽宁省工业、基本建设、交通运输企业的中心任务，是巩固扩大整风运动的成果，进一步发挥社会主义民主，充分发动和组织广大职工群众，全力贯彻执行勤俭建国、勤俭办企业和全面贯彻又多、又快、又好、又省和安全的方针，开展以增产节约为中心的社会主义竞赛，迎接和推进已经到来的社会主义生产建设新高潮，为完成国家计划和增产节约计划而奋斗。
    李涛说，今年一年来，辽宁省在领导增产节约运动中，贯彻和执行了中央提出的千方百计克服困难的方针，并且为实现这一方针采取了若干措施。但是，系统地、及时地批判和纠正消极保守思想是不够的。企业的生产潜力还未充分挖掘出来。因此，必须很好贯彻勤俭建国的方针，全面开展增产节约运动，充分发挥设备能力，努力增加生产。凡是设备利用率低的企业，都应当学习和推行先进企业提高设备效能的经验，采取积极的措施，使自己企业的设备利用率达到先进的水平；凡是原材料消耗高的企业，都应当学习和推行节约使用原材料的先进经验，采取积极措施提高原材料利用率，提高质量，减少废品率。在职工生活福利方面，应当提倡少花钱多办事，依靠群众兴办福利事业。同时，在一切企业中都应当提高技术、改进技术、推广技术，为生产更多更好的产品而努力。
