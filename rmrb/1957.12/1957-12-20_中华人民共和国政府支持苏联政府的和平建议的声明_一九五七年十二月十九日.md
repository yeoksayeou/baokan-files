    On December 10, 1957, N.A. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, wrote letters to the leaders of the governments of India, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, and other countries, putting forward a number of proposals of great significance for world peace. On December 12, 1957, the Soviet government also sent notes to the governments of all member states of the United Nations and the Swiss government, reiterating these proposals. The Soviet government requested the United States and the United Kingdom to jointly with the Soviet Union undertake the obligation not to use nuclear weapons, jointly declare a halt to nuclear weapons tests from January 1, 1958, and agree with each other not to deploy any type of unclear weapon on the territories of the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, and other countries. The Soviet government proposed the following measures to realize the idea of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems in the world: the members of the Warsaw Treaty Organization and the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should sign a non-aggression agreement between these two state groups; guarantee the independence and peace of the countries in the Middle East; cease hostile propaganda; expand economic, trade, and cultural ties between countries on the basis of mutual benefit. The Soviet government also expressed its willingness to agree to direct talks between the leaders of the great powers and advocated high-level talks between socialist and capitalist countries. These proposals by the Soviet government are extremely important steps toward resolving the entire disarmament issue, easing international tensions, and safeguarding world peace. The Chinese government fully agrees with and fully supports these proposals by the Soviet government.
    Recently, the ruling group in the United States has been using the latest Soviet scientific and technological achievements as an excuse to intensify its arms expansion and war preparations. Domestically, the American ruling group has already put forward the slogan of "more guns, less butter." Abroad, the American ruling group has put forward the so-called "interdependence," demanding that the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization make greater sacrifices and give up more sovereignty for a strategic plan that makes extensive use of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are under increasing pressure to agree to make their territories bases for the United States to deploy nuclear weapons and rocket weapons, and to hand over more resources, manpower, and science and technology to the United States for unified control. The American ruling group is also attempting to link the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with aggressive military blocs such as the Manila Treaty and the Baghdad Pact in some form, and to step up the implementation of colonialist policies in the Asian and African regions.
    Creating and exacerbating international tensions and using war threats for blackmail were originally policies commonly used by the American ruling group. However, the results of more than a decade of implementation show that this policy has completely failed. The blackmail policy of the American ruling group has not only failed to intimidate the socialist countries, but on the contrary, it has promoted the socialist countries to redouble their efforts to carry out socialist construction and consolidate their national defense. Now, the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has definitely surpassed the strength of the imperialist camp headed by the United States, not only in terms of political influence, but also in terms of some of the most important scientific and technological fields. The successful launch of artificial satellites by the Soviet Union and the unprecedented unity achieved at the two meetings of communist and workers' parties held in Moscow in November this year concentratedly demonstrate a new turning point in the international situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind. The blackmail policy of the American ruling group has also failed to intimidate nationalist countries. More and more nationalist countries are unwilling to tie themselves to the American chariot and have embarked on the path of peace and neutrality. The heroic struggles of the people of Egypt, Syria, and Indonesia against colonialism further prove that as long as there is a firm will and a united team, any threats and provocations of imperialism can be crushed. The blackmail policy of the American ruling group is also increasingly difficult to intimidate the people of its own country and of various Western countries. Within the imperialist countries, the broad masses of peace-loving people are launching increasingly broad struggles against the heavy burden of military expenditure and against war policies.
    The forces for maintaining peace in the world have become so strong that the American ruling group does not dare to launch a war at will. The Soviet Union's advantage in the production of the latest types of weapons is causing the blackmail policy of the American ruling group to go bankrupt. The war-induced nervousness and fear created for the purpose of blackmail have not only failed to achieve their goal, but on the contrary, have frightened the American ruling group itself. Although the American ruling group is more frantically expanding its arms and preparing for war in an attempt to reverse the situation, the result will inevitably be to further isolate itself in the world and bring about more serious political and economic crises for itself. If the American ruling group dares to take the risk and attempt to find a way out of war, then they will be digging their own graves and seeking their own destruction.
    For the American ruling group and their followers, now is the time to make a calm consideration and a wise choice. The Soviet government's proposals to stop the arms race and implement peaceful coexistence point out the only way out in the current situation. Although the Soviet Union definitely has an advantage in scientific research and military technology, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have absolutely no intention of using their advantage to threaten others. We have always advocated peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between countries with different social systems. The proposals put forward by the Soviet government are sufficient to prove the sincere peaceful aspirations of socialist countries. The peace-loving people of the world warmly welcome and support the proposals of the Soviet government, and they are closely watching the reactions of the US government and other Western governments. The resolution on the issue of peaceful coexistence among countries adopted by the 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly at its closing meeting is sufficient to reflect the aspirations of the world's peace-loving people and the strength of the forces of peace. To go to their own destruction, or to go to peaceful coexistence and cooperation among countries - this is the question facing the US government and other Western governments.
    Regardless of how the US government and its followers choose, we believe that the peace-loving people of all countries in the world will definitely advocate friendly cooperation and united progress in peaceful coexistence.

    中华人民共和国政府支持苏联政府的和平建议的声明
    一九五七年十二月十九日
    一九五七年十二月十日，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁分别写信给印度、美国、英国、法国、西德等国政府的领导人，提出了对于世界和平具有重大意义的许多建议。一九五七年十二月十二日，苏联政府又向联合国的全体会员国政府和瑞士政府发出了照会，重申这些建议。苏联政府要求美国、英国同苏联一起，承担不使用核武器的义务，共同宣布从一九五八年一月一日起停止核武器试验，并且彼此协议不在德意志民主共和国、德意志联邦共和国和别国的领土上设置任何类型的核武器。苏联政府建议采取以下的措施来实现世界上社会制度不同的国家和平共处的主张：由华沙条约成员国和北大西洋公约成员国签订这两个国家集团之间的互不侵犯协定；保障中近东地区国家的独立和和平；停止敌意的宣传；在互利的基础上扩大各国的经济贸易联系和文化联系。苏联政府还表示准备同意大国领导人的直接会谈，并且主张社会主义国家和资本主义国家举行高级代表的会谈。苏联政府的这些建议是解决整个裁军问题、和缓国际紧张局势和维护世界和平的极端重要的步骤。中国政府完全赞同并且全力支持苏联政府的这些建议。
    最近一个时期以来，美国统治集团利用苏联最新的科学技术成就作为借口，加紧扩军备战。在国内，美国统治集团已经提出了“多一些大炮，少一些牛油”的口号。在国外，美国统治集团提出了所谓“互相依赖主义”，要求北大西洋公约组织的成员国为一个广泛使用原子武器和氢武器的战略计划作出更大的牺牲，放弃更多的主权。北大西洋公约组织的成员国正受到越来越大的压力，要它们同意使自己的领土成为美国配置核武器和火箭武器的基地，要它们交出更多的资源、人力和科学技术，由美国统一支配。美国统治集团还企图把北大西洋公约组织同马尼拉条约和巴格达条约这类侵略性的军事集团用某种形式联系起来，加紧在亚非地区推行殖民主义政策。
    制造和加剧国际紧张局势，用战争威胁进行讹诈，本来是美国统治集团惯用的政策。但是，十几年来执行的结果说明这个政策完全失败了。美国统治集团的讹诈政策不仅丝毫没有吓倒社会主义国家，相反地，却推动了社会主义国家加倍努力进行社会主义的建设和巩固自己的国防。现在，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量，不仅在政治影响方面，而且在若干最重要的科学技术方面，已经肯定地超过了以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的力量。苏联发射人造卫星的成功和今年十一月各国共产党和工人党在莫斯科举行的两次会议所达到的空前团结，集中地表现出在国际局势中东风压倒西风这样一个新的转折点。美国统治集团的讹诈政策也没有能够吓倒民族主义国家。越来越多的民族主义国家不愿意把自己绑在美国的战车上，走上了和平中立的道路。埃及、叙利亚和印度尼西亚的人民英勇地反对殖民主义的斗争更证明了，只要有坚决的意志和团结的队伍，帝国主义的任何威胁和挑衅都是可以粉碎的。美国统治集团的讹诈政策也越来越难于吓倒本国的和西方各国的人民。在帝国主义各国内部，爱好和平的广大群众正在为反对沉重的军费负担和反对战争政策展开越来越广泛的斗争。
    世界上维护和平的力量已经强大得足以使美国统治集团不敢为所欲为地发动战争。苏联在生产最新式武器方面所占的优势使美国统治集团的讹诈政策正在宣告破产。为了进行讹诈而制造出来的对于战争的神经过敏和恐惧，不仅没有达到目的，相反地，却吓倒了美国统治集团自己。尽管美国统治集团正在更加疯狂地扩军备战，企图挽回局面，但是结果必然是使自己在世界上更加孤立，为自己招致更严重的政治危机和经济危机。如果美国统治集团竟敢挺而走险，企图从战争中寻找出路，那么他们就是自取灭亡，为自己挖掘坟墓。
    对于美国统治集团和他们的追随者来说，现在是进行冷静的考虑和作出明智的抉择的时候了。苏联政府提出的停止军备竞赛和实行和平共处的各项建议，指出了在当前局势中的唯一出路。尽管苏联在科学研究方面和军事技术方面肯定地占了优势，但是，苏联和其他社会主义国家完全没有以自己的优势来威胁别人的意图。我们一贯主张社会制度不同的国家和平共处，并且进行和平竞赛。苏联政府所提出的建议正足以证明社会主义国家的真诚的和平愿望。世界各国爱好和平的人民热烈地欢迎和支持苏联政府的建议，他们正在密切地注意着美国政府和其他西方国家政府的反应。联合国大会第十二届会议，在闭幕会议上所通过的关于各国和平共处问题的决议，正足以反映世界爱好和平人民的愿望和和平力量的强大。走向自己的毁灭，还是走向各国的和平共处和合作，这就是摆在美国政府和其他西方国家政府面前的问题。
    不管美国政府和它的追随者如何选择，我们相信，世界各国爱好和平的人民是一定会主张在和平共处中友好合作、团结前进的。
