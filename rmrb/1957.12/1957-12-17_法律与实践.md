    Law and Practice

    The proletarian legal theory always implements the supreme principle of political practice. Marxism-Leninism emphasizes the dependence of theory on practice. Theory is based on practice and, in turn, serves practice.

    We emphasize starting from reality, but bourgeois rightists scold us for "creeping empiricism," "AQ spirit," and "self-intoxication." Is it wrong for us to advocate that theory must be combined with practice in the legal field? If we don't understand the Chinese situation, don't seriously study the Chinese situation, and want to write laws that meet the needs of the Chinese people and establish our own legal theory, is that possible? In the process of establishing our people's democratic legal system, we have not prematurely and rigidly subjectively prescribed a set of rules. Instead, we have carefully and gradually promulgated many laws from simple to complex based on the development of the political and economic situation. Although we do not yet have complete codes of all kinds, the various laws and decrees we have promulgated have basically satisfied the mission that laws should have in various past stages. The rightists oppose our legislative approach of starting from reality, mainly to restore the old legal system they are obsessed with, to realize their restoration of the old law, or the so-called "combination of new and old laws."

    Because they oppose our measures of starting from reality in legal and legal system work, the rightists deeply resent the guiding principles of Marxism-Leninism. They say that we "replace the law with Marxism-Leninism." This is the most shameless distortion! We have never said that Marxism-Leninism is jurisprudence. We say that socialist jurisprudence is Marxist-Leninist jurisprudence. But socialist jurisprudence without Marxism-Leninism also loses its soul. Marxism-Leninism teaches us to use the correct standpoint, viewpoint, and method to understand and analyze reality, summarize reality, and then guide practical action. Even the most complete law cannot be a panacea. No law can stipulate all specific situations. Even with laws, problems cannot be solved if we fail to proceed from reality. The rightists' vilification of Marxism-Leninism not only proves their complete ignorance in law but also proves that they do have ulterior motives.

### 法律与实践

专栏：报刊论文摘要

    法律与实践
    无产阶级的法学理论始终贯彻着政治实践的最高原则。马克思列宁主义强调理论对于实践的依赖性，理论的基础是实践，转过来又为实践服务。
    我们强调从实际出发，资产阶级右派分子却骂我们“爬行经验主义”、“阿Q精神”、“自我陶醉”。难道说，法律方面我们主张理论必须与实际结合，有什么不对的吗？如果不懂得中国情况，不认真研究中国情况，而要写出符合中国人民需要的法律与建立起自己的法学理论来，难道是可能的吗？在我们建立人民民主法制的过程中，我们没有过早过死地主观地规定一套，而是谨谨慎慎地根据政治经济情况的发展，逐步由简而繁地颁布了不少法律，我们现在虽还没有完备的各种各样的法典，但是我们已经颁布的各种法令基本上满足了法律在过去各个阶段所应有的使命。右派分子反对我们这种从实际出发的立法方式，主要是为了要恢复他们所迷恋不舍的旧法统，以实现其为旧法复辟，或所谓“新旧法并用”的主张。
    因为反对我们法学与法制工作中的从实际出发的措施，右派分子对于马列主义的指导原则是深恶痛绝的。他们说我们“用马列主义代替了法律”。这真是最无耻的歪曲！我们从来没有说过，马列主义就是法学。我们说的是社会主义法学也就是马列主义法学。但是社会主义法学没有了马列主义，那就也失掉了它的灵魂。马列主义教导我们用正确的立场、观点、方法去认识与分析实际、总结实际，反过来再来指导实际行动。就是最完备的法律也不能一劳永逸。没有一个法律能够把所有的具体情况都规定下来。有了法律以后，如果不能从实际出发，仍然是解决不了问题的。右派分子诋毁马列主义，这不仅证明他们在法学上是彻底的无知，也证明了他们确是另有意图的。（摘自1957年“政法研究”第六期，芮沐：“加强法律科学的战斗性”）
