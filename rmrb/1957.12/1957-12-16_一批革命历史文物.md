    A Batch of Revolutionary Historical Relics
    Recently, the Dachuan Special District of Sichuan Province collected a lot of revolutionary cultural relics. The Dachuan Special District is an old revolutionary base area in the Sichuan-Shaanxi border region. Around 1933, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army established Communist Party organizations and Soviet power here and carried out class struggles to fight warlords, local bullies, and divide land. Therefore, many revolutionary historical relics have been preserved in the hands of the masses to this day. In 1951, the Central Visiting Group collected revolutionary historical relics here once; this year in March, the Dachuan Prefectural Commissioner's Office conducted another collection, and by mid-November, more than a thousand cultural relics had been collected. The important ones include:
  "Constitution of the Communist Party of China" (a total of fifteen chapters, twenty-seven pages), "Notice to Party Members," "Outline of the Constitution of the Chinese Soviet Republic," "Resolutions of the Second Congress of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Province," "Operational Map of the Fourth Front Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army," "Land Reform Law," and other thirteen documents; one hundred and twenty revolutionary song selections, slogans, and leaflets; more than twenty items such as base-level organization imprints, stamps, party emblems, and land certificates of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Provincial Soviet Government; the battle positions personally commanded by Marshal Xu Xiangqian, the building where the 31st Red Army held师and regimental-level cadre meetings, and nine photos of martyrs; more than nine hundred items such as wheels, water tanks (for water in military factories), knives, spears, grenades, silver, copper, cloth, and banknotes; in addition, there is a machine for manufacturing guns from a military factory in the Red Army era in 1933.
    Most of these revolutionary historical relics were preserved by Red Army cadres, Red Army martyrs' families, military dependents, and farmers. During the period of reactionary rule and white terror, they tried every means to preserve them with their lives and tears. Most of these documents were hidden in earthen wall cracks, under stone tablets, on mountain slopes, under citrus trees, and in cellars. Red Army cadre Liu Kaiyun was repeatedly beaten by reactionary warlords, landlords, and bullies in order to preserve the "Constitution of the Communist Party of China" and was forced to hand over Soviet documents, but he endured the pain and humiliation and refused to hand them over even to death. In order to preserve the documents, he made a wooden box to pack the Party Constitution and put it into a dug-out wall, and then sealed the outside of the cave with mud. Farmers in Desheng Township, Pingchang County, found the 1933 reports, rosters of soldiers, literacy textbooks, and applications to join the Party under a stone tablet. (He Shiyou)

    一批革命历史文物
    四川省达县专区最近收集到不少革命文物。达县专区是川陕边革命老根据地，1933年前后工农红军在这里建立过共产党组织和苏维埃政权，进行了打军阀、打土豪、分田地的阶级斗争，因此，至今有不少的革命历史文物保存在群众手里。1951年中央访问团曾经在这里收集过一次革命历史文物；今年3月达县专署又进行了一次收集，到11月中旬止已经收集到上千件文物。重要的有：
  “中国共产党党章”（共十五章，二十七页）、“党员须知”“中华苏维埃共和国宪法大纲”“川陕省第二次工农代表大会决议”、“中国工农红军第四方面军作战地图”“土地改革法”等十三份；革命歌选、标语、宣传单一百二十张；川陕省苏维埃政府的基层组织印模、条戳、党花、土地证等二十多件；徐向前元帅亲自指挥的作战阵地、红三十一军召开师、团级干部会议的大楼和烈士照片九张；车轮、王水缸（军工厂装水的）、刀、矛、手榴弹、银、铜、布、纸币等九百余件；此外，有1933年红军时代兵工厂制造枪枝的一部机器。
    这些革命历史文物绝大部分是保存在红军干部、红军烈属、军属和农民手里的，是他们在反动统治时期白色恐怖的环境里，想尽各种办法，用自己的生命和血泪保藏起来的。这些文件大都藏在土墙缝里，石碑底下，山坡上，柑子树底下，地窖里。红军干部刘开云为了保存“中国共产党党章”，曾经受到反动军阀、地主、豪绅的多次毒打，要向他勒取苏维埃的文件，但他忍痛受辱，宁死不交。为了保全文件，他做了一个木箱子把党章装好，放到挖好了的墙洞里去，洞外再用泥巴封闭。平昌县德胜乡农民在石碑底下找出1933年的汇报材料、战士花名册、学文化的本子和入党志愿书等。　（贺世友）
