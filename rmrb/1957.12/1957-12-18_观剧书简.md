　　Theater Review Letters
　　Comrade Yue Ye Weishi:

    After seeing "A Hundred Ugly Portraits," I clearly felt that it was your invaluable political enthusiasm that made it possible to rehearse and stage this play in a timely manner. This is absolutely indispensable for artists.

    The performance of "A Hundred Ugly Portraits" was good, and the audience's reaction was consistently enthusiastic. They were constantly reacting and discussing, saying that this person's words came from that real right-wing figure. The tacit understanding and exchange between the stage and the audience rippled throughout the theater. Although this script is not yet top complete or top profound, the right-wing group's ugly anti-Party and anti-socialist criminal activities were vividly depicted through your performance and displayed in broad daylight; in this alone, your contribution is not small.

    You know I wouldn't give compliments randomly. I think the director's handling was really good; you can't see so much just by looking at the script. The lively and fast pace and atmosphere of saying wind is wind and saying rain is rain on stage, the transfer of character positions, the design of actions, and the interesting and necessary pantomime interludes all demonstrated the director's talent. In addition, I would also like to say: the director of "A Hundred Ugly Portraits" has made significant progress compared to when she directed "Looking Towards Chang'an" the year before last. I think the first scene "Ugly Crowd's Wild Dance" was the best arranged. Several scenes of "Stirring Up Trouble" felt a bit weaker because the script was written weaker here. The last scene "Collapse" is also good. The handling of the ugly crowd tearing down and exposing each other has the style of the ending of "The Imperial Envoy," but the progress of the play seems to still be able to be more relaxed, or more securely achieve the desired effect.

    Generally speaking, the impression of the negative characters in the play is deeper than that of the positive characters. The positive characters in the script are not written well. This is mainly – I think – because the positive characters are not given comedic vitality. When they are stirred up but don't ignite, they can completely use humor and sarcasm in conjunction, using fiery language to counterattack the rightists with poison. The shortcomings of the script in this regard further raise the question of how to portray positive characters in comedies.

    Among the actors, Zhuang Zejing, who plays Director Zhao, Zhang Ping, who plays Professor Qian, Geng Zhen, who plays Committee Member Zheng, and Liu Yan, who plays Ms. Wu, are more prominent. The performances of the two young actors who play opera actors and male hoodlums are also passable. Other comrades may not have been able to develop more due to the character portrayals in the script. When we meet, we always talk with the feeling that the Experimental Theater has not yet had a better theater, but I think that as a theater, you already have the most important of all assets, which is a very good team of actors. I can see that you are very fond of these "treasures." Absolutely should be! As for the theater, I think there will definitely be one in the future.

    You rehearsed this play during the tense anti-rightist movement and staged it in a timely manner, and the audience will thank you for your work. May this flower of the Experimental Theater become more and more beautiful in continuous labor and creation, and in the baptism of struggle!

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Your comrade and friend Yue Ye

　　观剧书简
　　岳野维世同志：
    看了“百丑图”，让我明显地感到是由于你们极可贵的政治热情，才做到及时地排练并上演了这个戏的。这对艺术工作者们来说完全不可缺少。
    “百丑图”演出的效果是好的，观众们的反映情绪始终是饱满的。他们时时反映着、议论着，说这人这话出自那一个真的右派人物；台上台下的默契与交流荡漾在全剧场。虽然就这个剧本来说，还不算顶完整、顶深刻，但右派群丑反党反社会主义的罪恶活动，却通过你们的演出形象地描绘了出来，展现在光天化日之下；单单在这一点上，你们的功绩就是不小的。
    你知道我是不会乱恭维人的。我觉得导演的处理确实很不错，光看剧本是看不到那末多东西的。台上说风即风，说雨即雨的活泼、快速的节奏和气氛，人物地位的调动，动作的设计，有趣的又是必要的哑剧过场等都表现了导演的才干。另外我还想说：“百丑图”的导演要比前年她导演“西望长安”时有了显著的发展。我认为第一场戏“群丑乱舞”排得最好，几场“煽风点火”因为剧本在这里写得较弱，演出也觉差点。最后一场“土崩瓦解”也不错，群丑相互拆穿、揭发的处理大有“巡按”结尾之风，但戏的进行似乎仍可从容些，或可更稳妥地取得应有的效果。
    整个说来，剧中反面人物较正面人物的印象为深。剧本中正面人物写得不算好。这主要是——我以为——没有给予正面人物以喜剧的生命力。当他们被煽风点火而不燃，完全可以幽默、辛辣并举，以火焰般的语言以毒攻毒反击右派的。剧本在这方面的缺点，更进一步提出了如何刻画喜剧中的正面人物形象问题。
    演员中以饰赵主任的庄则敬，饰钱教授的张平，饰郑委员的耿震，饰吴女士的刘燕谨较突出。饰戏曲演员和男阿飞的两位青年演员的表演也都过得去。其他同志们可能因剧本中人物的刻画关系而未得到更多地发挥。我们相见时，总以美中不足的心情谈道实验话剧院眼下还没有一个较好的剧场，但我觉得作为一个剧院来说，你们已有了一切财产中最主要的，那就是很不错的一支演员队伍。我看得出来，你是非常热爱这些“财宝”的。完全应当！至于剧场，我想将来一定会有的。
    你们在紧张的反右运动中排演了这个戏，而且及时上演了，观众会感谢你们的劳动的。愿实验话剧院这朵花在不断的劳动创作中，在斗争的洗礼中越来越美丽！
                          你们的同志和朋友　岳野
