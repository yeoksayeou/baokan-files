　　Making Preparations for the Winter Patriotic Health Campaign
　　Commentator of this newspaper
    The "National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft)" proposed by the Party at the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee clearly points out that, in addition to eliminating the four pests and striving to eliminate the diseases that most seriously endanger people's health, we should actively carry out regular mass patriotic health campaigns and develop good habits of everyone paying attention to hygiene and every household loving cleanliness. In implementing this spirit, various places are actively starting this year's winter patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests.
    How can we ensure the smooth development of the winter patriotic health campaign? Carefully doing preparatory work is a crucial key. Over the past few years, various places and systems have accumulated a lot of experience and created many simple, easy-to-implement, and effective methods for eliminating the four pests. Therefore, summarizing and promoting these experiences and methods is an important part of preparing for the winter patriotic health campaign. Some places, after summarizing the experiences of typical units, organize relevant personnel and the broad masses to observe and exchange experiences, which plays a significant role in enhancing the masses' confidence in eliminating the four pests.
    In the work of summarizing past experiences, all localities should pay close attention to the issue of combining the patriotic health campaign with production, work, and study, especially issues related to current winter production. Past experience has proven that in places where this issue is handled well, the masses are easily mobilized, and the movement can be regularized. This year, Beijing has been piloting the method of sealing compost piles with mud in nine suburban areas to eliminate breeding grounds for flies. This is a major method of eliminating fly breeding grounds. This method is both hygienic and can increase fertilizer quantity and improve fertilizer effectiveness, and it is very popular among farmers. Because this method is also suitable for use in winter, the municipal leadership has emphasized summarizing and promoting it during the preparation period, which is very meaningful for promoting the current movement.
    Because the patriotic health campaign is a mass movement, according to past experience, the masses in places where previous movements have been carried out well or poorly have many new ideological issues. When conducting ideological mobilization, we should first deeply study the masses' ideological situation, pay attention to using real-life examples of real people and events, and profoundly explain the harm of the four pests, and inspire the masses' hatred of the four pests by presenting the facts, reasoning, and making careful calculations. For example, in addition to rats spreading diseases such as plague, rat-bite fever, and food poisoning, they also waste a large amount of grain. Calculating at eighteen catties of grain eaten by one rat per year, if a family has ten rats, they will eat 180 catties of grain, not including the loss of damaged items. If we publicize such detailed accounts to the masses, the masses will hate rats in order to prevent diseases and protect grain.
    Before the movement is launched, it is necessary to improve the organization of the patriotic health campaign at all levels in order to give full play to the role of the organization. All regions and units should assign dedicated personnel to be responsible for health work (non-detached from production), conduct regular supervision and inspection, and achieve "someone is responsible at every level and everywhere." In order to concentrate the strength of all parties, health departments at all levels must consult with relevant departments and assign responsibilities according to the business nature of each department in order to give full play to the active cooperation of all parties. In the preparatory work, Beijing's measures to organize relevant departments to cooperate in carrying out the work are very beneficial to promoting the development of the movement. For example, in terms of publicity work, in addition to organizing news organizations such as newspapers and radio stations to conduct timely publicity and reporting, they also arranged for cultural departments to show slides in cinemas, commercial departments to use shop windows for publicity, and medical institutions to conduct publicity in conjunction with waiting room education and family visits. In addition, relevant departments such as handicrafts, local industry, and commerce are required to ensure the supply of materials for capturing sparrows and rats, etc., to meet the requirements of carrying out the movement.
    Finally, to ensure that all preparations are done well, party and government at all levels must strengthen leadership. Some party and government leaders do not fully recognize the importance of carrying out the winter patriotic health campaign and simply regard it as the business of the health department. In this way, the movement cannot be well carried out. Only under the unified leadership of the party and government, through in-depth investigation and research, formulating a practical and feasible plan for carrying out the winter patriotic health campaign, and implementing it step by step, can we concentrate our strength, unify our pace, and do a good job in ideological mobilization and organizational preparation.

### 做好冬季爱国卫生运动的准备工作

　　做好冬季爱国卫生运动的准备工作
　　本报评论员
    党在三中全会提出的“全国农业发展纲要”（修正草案）中，明确地指出：除四害和努力消灭危害人民健康最严重的疾病，应积极开展群众的经常性的爱国卫生运动，养成人人讲卫生，家家爱清洁的良好习惯。各地贯彻这一精神，都在积极地着手开展今年冬季以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动。
    怎样保证冬季爱国卫生运动的顺利开展呢？认真做好准备工作是一个重要的关键。几年来，各地各系统都积累了不少经验，创造出很多简单易行、切实有效的消灭四害的办法。因此，把这些经验和办法作出总结和进行推广，是开展冬季爱国卫生运动准备工作的重要内容。有些地方在总结典型单位的经验以后，组织有关人员和广大群众进行观摩和交流经验，这对提高群众除四害的信心很起作用。
    在总结过去经验的工作中，各地对于开展爱国卫生运动结合生产、工作和学习的问题，特别是对当前冬季生产有关系的问题，应该很好注意。过去的经验证明，凡是对这个问题处理较好的地方，群众易于发动起来，运动也能够经常化。今年北京市为了消灭苍蝇的孳生条件，曾在郊区九个地方试行泥封堆肥方法。这是消灭苍蝇孳生条件的一项主要办法。这个办法既讲卫生，又可以增加肥量、提高肥效，很受农民的欢迎。因为这个办法也适合在冬季采用，市领导方面在准备期间，就重视总结和推广它，这对于推动当前的运动是很有意义的。
    因为爱国卫生运动是群众性的运动，根据过去的经验，以前的运动开展得好或者不好的地方，群众在思想上都存在有不少新的问题。在进行思想动员时，应该首先深入研究群众的思想情况，注意以真人真事的实例，通过摆事实，讲道理和算细账的方法，深刻说明四害的危害性，启发群众对四害的仇恨。例如老鼠传染鼠疫、鼠咬热和食物中毒等疾病以外，还糟踏大量粮食。按每年一只老鼠吃粮食十八斤计算，一家如有十个老鼠，就要吃掉一百八十斤粮食，咬坏物品的损失还不计算在内。如把这样的细账向群众宣传，为了防止疾病和保粮，群众就会对老鼠仇恨起来。
    在运动开展以前，必须健全各级爱国卫生运动的组织，才能很好地发挥组织的作用。各地区、各单位都应该调配有专人负责卫生工作（不脱产的），经常进行监督和检查，做到“层层处处有人负责”。为了集中各方面的力量，各地各级卫生部门必须和有关部门进行协商，并根据各部门的业务性质分工负责，以发挥各方面的积极配合作用。北京市在准备工作中，组织各有关部门配合进行工作的措施，对推动运动的开展是很有利的。如在宣传工作方面，除去组织报社和电台等新闻机关进行及时宣传报道以外，还布置文化部门在电影院放映幻灯片，商业部门利用商店橱窗进行宣传，医疗机构结合候诊教育、家庭访视进行宣传。此外，对于手工业、地方工业、商业等有关部门，则要求他们保证做好有关捕雀捕鼠等工作的物资供应工作，以适应开展运动的要求。
    最后，要保证做好各项准备工作，必须各级党政加强领导。有的党政领导同志没有充分认识开展冬季爱国卫生运动的重要意义，只简单地把它看成是卫生部门的业务。这样就不能使运动很好开展起来。只有在党政的统一领导下，经过深入地调查研究，制定出开展冬季爱国卫生运动的切实可行的计划，并有步骤地加以实行，才能集中力量，统一步调，做好思想动员和组织准备工作。
