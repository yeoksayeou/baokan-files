Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 11th -- Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, gave a report on the issue of rectification and study in industry and commerce to more than 5,600 industrialists and businessmen in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City on the afternoon of the 4th.

Chen Shutong came here after inspecting the rectification situation of industry and commerce in Wuhan, Changsha and other cities. In the past few days, he went deep into the grassroots to understand the rectification situation of industry and commerce in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City.

In his report, Chen Shutong said: At present, the anti-Rightist struggle in industry and commerce has achieved initial victory, especially the anti-Rightist struggle in the leadership of industry and commerce at the central, provincial and most municipal levels has achieved a decisive victory. The anti-Rightist struggle in industry and commerce in Guangdong Province has also achieved initial victory under the leadership of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee at all levels and the promotion of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce at all levels. We are more satisfied with this.

However, from the perspective of the entire task of comprehensive rectification in industry and commerce, the movement still needs to be further developed in depth. The anti-Rightist struggle and general rectification in various places are mainly carried out at the level of backbone members of industry and commerce. The comprehensive rectification of general capitalists and capitalist agents has only just begun, and some have not yet begun. Socialist education for small industrialists and businessmen must still be carried out repeatedly and universally. Many industrialists and businessmen still have doubts about the policies and guidelines of the rectification movement. This shows that the task of comprehensive rectification in industry and commerce in the future is still arduous. He said: The comprehensive rectification of industry and commerce is a rectification movement that includes opposing Rightists, breaking capitalist standpoints, and establishing socialist standpoints. It should be recognized that the primary task of this movement is the anti-Rightist struggle.

Next, Chen Shutong analyzed several unnecessary concerns in the anti-Rightist struggle and rectification in industry and commerce. He said: Some people think that rectification is to find Rightists, saying that "the anti-Rightist struggle only targets a few people, but rectification will target everyone," fearing that rectification will be like the anti-Rightist struggle, causing anxiety. We say that this concern is unnecessary. From the Party's policy and the actual situation of the current rectification movement, this is not the case. The anti-Rightist struggle is an important part of the comprehensive rectification, but not the only part. The comprehensive rectification movement aims to resolve the two different types of contradictions between the enemy and ourselves and among the people. The anti-Rightist struggle is an antagonistic and irreconcilable life-and-death contradiction between the enemy and ourselves. Therefore, resolute struggle must be carried out against the Rightists. For the majority of people in industry and commerce, it is a rectification that belongs to the internal affairs of the people. The purpose is to change their political stance and truly turn to the socialist side. For the internal affairs of the people, the main method is education, the method of "unity-criticism-unity," and the use of gentle and mild methods. Therefore, as long as you are not a Rightist, you don't need to worry about being targeted.

Should small industrialists and businessmen be rectified? Chen Shutong said: Some people think that rectification is a matter for large households, and small households have nothing to rectify, so they hold a "none of my business" attitude. Both this understanding and attitude are wrong. Small industrialists and businessmen also face the problem of the two roads of socialism and capitalism. They should also eliminate the capitalist standpoint and establish a socialist standpoint through the rectification movement, clarify the major issues of right and wrong, so as to correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the collective, the individual and the country, and serve socialism well, and pass the socialist test well.

In his report, Chen Shutong analyzed the situation after the high tide of socialist transformation in 1956. He said: After last year's high tide of socialist transformation, only a very few people in industry and commerce truly solved the problem of political standpoint, and the capitalist standpoint of most industrialists and businessmen has not changed. Is it possible to continue to maintain a capitalist standpoint without transformation? It is definitely not possible. Because from the trend of the world situation, capitalism is a declining and dying road. From the current situation in our country, the capitalist standpoint is already reactionary and must be changed. In short, today's capitalist standpoint is unfavorable to socialism and to the industrialists and businessmen themselves under any circumstances. Therefore, we must resolutely change the capitalist standpoint.

Chen Shutong finally said: Today, the rectification movement is of decisive significance for the class transformation of every industrialist and businessman. Actively participating in the rectification movement is the practice of the transformation of every industrialist and businessman. This time, we must seriously transform our political standpoints through the rectification movement, clarify the major issues of right and wrong, and firmly and wholeheartedly stand on the side of socialism. We believe that the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen will be able to transform themselves in the movement and pass the socialist test well.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th -- Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, gave a rectification report to 14,000 industrialists and businessmen here on October 22nd during his inspection of the rectification work in industry and commerce in Shanghai in October.

In his report, Huang Yanpei first listed some examples of changes before and after the liberation of Shanghai, pointing out the scourge of the capitalist system. Then he said that after the implementation of joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce, the transformation of enterprises has been basically completed, but the ideological transformation of people who were engaged in capitalist industry and commerce has not yet been completed. The facts of the past two years have proved that the most important thing is the transformation of political standpoints. How to transform it? The leadership instructed us to have a rectification movement in industry and commerce.

Huang Yanpei said that in the past few days since we came to Shanghai, we have seen some big-character posters posted by industrialists and businessmen in the rectification movement, listened to discussions in several groups, and had many talks with leading comrades of the rectification work committee in industry and commerce. We believe that the attitude of most people participating in the rectification is correct, especially through the form of big-character posters, the door of criticism and self-criticism has been opened. However, from the tens of thousands of big-character posters, it can be seen that many wrong words and deeds have also appeared in our industry and commerce. These wrong words and deeds show that most of our industrialists and businessmen have not basically abandoned the capitalist standpoint. If we do not abandon this standpoint, how can we smoothly transition to a socialist society? The Communist Party is wise, and the Party has timely called on our industry and commerce to rise up for rectification and asked us to change our political standpoints so that we can pass the socialist test well. We should consciously and actively participate in the rectification movement to repay the Party's kind concern for us.

Huang Yanpei then pointed out that rectification is like taking a bath. Bathing should be done frequently, and you should take off your clothes to wash. Rectification requires opening up your mind first, which is like taking off your clothes before taking a bath. But some people still have concerns about this. Some people are afraid of being scalded by the water, some are afraid of catching a cold, and some are shy and don't want to take off their clothes; some have unbuttoned their buttons, but are unwilling to take off their clothes. How can they take a bath like this? Rectification cannot be done without opening up your mind. The key to the problem is to make up your mind and realize that the dirt on your body will affect your health and cause illness. To make up your mind to participate in the rectification, you must realize the reactionary nature of the capitalist standpoint, which will ruin our bright future, so that you can dispel your concerns. Huang Yanpei believes that mutual criticism and mutual assistance are necessary in rectification. He said that there is also a standpoint issue in this. If you stand on the capitalist standpoint, you will think that mutual criticism is unfair to friends, hurts feelings, and will be scolded as "selling friends for glory." Huang Yanpei told the industrialists and businessmen to focus on the six political criteria taught by Chairman Mao and the seven questions raised by Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, to relate to their thoughts, connect with reality, help each other, and carry out criticism and self-criticism.

After the report, Huang Yanpei also excitedly recited a poem he created, "Forward! Forward! Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, everyone advances to socialism!"

### 破资本主义立场　立社会主义立场  陈叔通黄炎培分别在广州上海谈工商界整风问题

　　破资本主义立场　立社会主义立场
    陈叔通黄炎培分别在广州上海谈工商界整风问题
    新华社广州11日电　中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通，4日下午对广东省和广州市五千六百多个工商业者作了有关工商界整风学习问题的报告。
    陈叔通是在武汉、长沙等城市视察工商界整风情况以后来到这里的。几天来他深入基层了解了广东省和广州市工商界的整风情况。
    陈叔通在报告中说：目前，工商界反右派斗争已经取得初步胜利，特别是中央、省和大部分市的工商界领导层的反右派斗争已经取得决定性的胜利。广东省工商界的反右派斗争，在中共广东省各级党委的领导下，在民主建国会和工商联各级组织的推动下，也已取得初步胜利。我们对此较为满意。
    但就工商界全面整风的全部任务来看，运动还需要进一步深入发展。各地反右派斗争和一般整风主要是在工商界骨干分子这一层进行的，一般资本家和资本家代理人的全面整风还只是开始，有的尚未开始，对小型工商业者的社会主义教育工作仍须反复普遍进行，不少工商业者对整风运动的方针政策还有怀疑。这就说明，今后工商界全面整风的任务还是艰巨的。他说：工商界的全面整风，就是一个包括反对右派，破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场为内容的整风运动。应当认识，这个运动的首要任务就是反右派斗争。
    接着，陈叔通分析工商界反右派斗争和整风中几种不必要的疑虑。他说：有人认为整风是为了找右派分子，说“反右派斗争只斗几个人，整风却要整到每个人的头上”，害怕整风也像反右派一样斗争，因而疑惧不安。我们说，这种顾虑是不必要的，从党的政策上来看，从当前整风运动的实际情况来看，都不是如此。反右派斗争是全面整风的重要内容，但不是唯一的内容。全面整风运动要解决敌我之间和人民内部之间两种不同性质的矛盾，反右派斗争是对抗性的不可调和的你死我活的敌我矛盾，因此，对右派分子要进行坚决的斗争；对工商界的大多数人来说是属于人民内部的整风，目的是改变自己的政治立场，真正转到社会主义这一边来。对于人民内部，主要是用教育的方法，“团结——批评——团结”的方法，采用和风细雨的方式。所以，只要不是右派分子，就用不着耽心会斗到自己头上来。
    对小型工商业者要不要整风呢？陈叔通说：有人认为整风是大户的事情，小户没有什么可整的，因而抱着“与我无关”的态度。这种认识和态度都是错误的。小型工商业者同样存在着社会主义和资本主义两条道路的问题，也应该通过整风运动，破除资本主义立场，确立社会主义立场，明确大是大非，以正确处理个人和集体、个人和国家的关系，很好地为社会主义服务，过好社会主义这一关。
    陈叔通在报告中分析了1956年社会主义改造高潮后的情况，他说：经过去年社会主义改造高潮，工商界中真正解决了政治立场问题的只是极少数人，大多数工商业者的资本主义立场并未改变。可否不要改造而继续保持资本主义立场呢？肯定地说是不可以的。因为从世界形势的趋势上来说，资本主义是一条没落的死亡的道路，从当前我国情况来说，资本主义立场已经是反动的，是非改变不可的。总之，今天的资本主义立场，无论在什么情况下都是不利于社会主义，不利于工商界自己。所以，我们必须坚决地改变资本主义立场。
    陈叔通最后说：今天对于每个工商业者的阶级本质的改造，具有决定性意义的，就是整风运动。积极参加整风运动，是每一个工商业者脱胎换骨的改造的实践。这次我们一定要通过整风运动，认真地改造自己的政治立场，明确大是大非，坚定地一心一意地站到社会主义一边来。我们相信，绝大多数工商业者一定能够在运动中获得改造，一定能够过好社会主义关。
    新华社上海11日电　中国民主建国会中央常务委员会主任委员黄炎培，10月份来上海视察工商界整风工作期间，在10月22日向这里的一万四千名工商业者作了一次整风报告。
    黄炎培在报告中，首先列举了上海解放前后变化的一些事例，指出资本主义制度的祸害。接着他说，资本主义工商业实行全行业公私合营后，企业的改造基本完成了，但曾从事资本主义工商业人的思想改造还没有完成，两年来的事实证明，最重要的是政治立场的改造。怎样改造呢？领导上指示我们，工商界来一个整风运动。
    黄炎培说，我们来到上海这几天，看了一些工商业者在整风运动中贴的大字报，旁听了几个小组的讨论，和工商界整风工作委员会领导同志进行了多次谈话。我们认为，大多数人参加整风的态度是端正的，特别是通过大字报的形式打开了批评和自我批评的大门。但是，从几万张大字报中间看出，工商界中也出现不少错误言行，这些错误言行说明了我们工商界大多数人基本上还没有抛弃资本主义立场，如果不抛弃这种立场，怎么能平平稳稳地过渡到社会主义社会里去呢？共产党是英明的，党及时地号召我们工商界自己起来整风，要我们改变政治立场，让我们过好社会主义这一关。我们应该自觉地积极地投到整风运动中去，来报答党对我们的亲切关怀。
    黄炎培接着指出，整风等于洗澡，洗澡是要经常洗的，而且要脱光了衣裳来洗的。整风首先要敞开思想，这就好比洗澡先要脱光衣裳。但是有些人对这还有顾虑，有的人怕水烫，有的人怕着凉，有的人怕羞，想不脱衣裳；有的虽然纽扣解开了，但不肯脱衣裳，这怎么能洗澡呢？整风不敞开思想不行，问题的关键就在下决心，要认识到身上的肮脏会影响健康，会生病。下决心参加整风，就要认识到资本主义立场的反动性，会葬送我们的光明前途，这样就能够打消顾虑。黄炎培认为整风中必须相互批评，相互帮助。他说，这中间也有立场问题。如果站在资本主义立场，就会认为相互批评是对不起朋友，伤感情，会被人骂“卖友求荣”。黄炎培告诉工商业者，要围绕毛主席教导我们的六项政治标准，和中共中央统战部部长李维汉提出的七个问题来联系思想，联系实际，互相帮助，展开批评和自我批评。
    黄炎培在报告后，还兴奋地朗诵了一首自己创作的“进！进！在中国共产党领导下大家向社会主义前进！”的诗。
