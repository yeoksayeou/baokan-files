Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang -- Zhou Lin, First Secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Governor of Guizhou Province, stated in his concluding report at the Four-Level Cadre Conference convened by the Guizhou Provincial Committee on the 2nd, that local nationalism has seen new growth in recent years, and in many places has become a dangerous tendency. While continuing to criticize Han chauvinism, it is entirely necessary to emphasize the criticism of local nationalism. If this erroneous thinking is not seriously criticized, it will be detrimental to socialism and unity among all nationalities.

Based on the exposure and criticism of local nationalism at the Four-Level Cadre Conference, Zhou Lin explained that local nationalist sentiments in Guizhou Province are currently mainly manifested in the following issues:

	I. On the issue of ethnic relations, the general line of mutual assistance and unity among all ethnic groups in jointly building the socialist family of the motherland is ignored, or this general line is disapproved of, and single-ethnic autonomy is emphasized. Some people mistakenly believe that only by establishing single-ethnic autonomy can there be financial power, can the economy and culture of the ethnic group be developed, and can cadres of the ethnic group be trained. In some multi-ethnic areas, there have also been instances of mutual distrust or the erroneous belief that the Party favors one group over another, valuing this group while not valuing that group, or that your group has more cadres while my group has fewer cadres, etc.

	II. On the issue of cadres, some people have serious xenophobic sentiments, emphasizing only the ethnicization of cadres while not emphasizing their communization. They mistakenly believe that only cadres of their own ethnic group can seek the welfare of the ethnic group. In addition, some ethnic cadres, after being promoted, look down on Han and other ethnic cadres. For example, they are dissatisfied with being a deputy.

	III. On the issue of obeying the leadership of the Party, among some ethnic cadres working in the government, there is a growing trend of disobedience to the unified leadership of the Party committee, with each doing things their own way, and some even attempting to stand up to the Party committee on an equal footing. Some ethnic Party member cadres serving as county heads even said: "The county Party committee replaces the government with the Party, and we have the title but no power; some government departments are nominal." In more serious individual cases, some even said: "The people elected me to be in charge, but I am not in control." In addition, some Party member cadres (some are members of the county Party committee) do not implement the resolutions and instructions of the county Party committee, and each acts on their own. In Sandu Shui Autonomous County, individual county Party committee cadres were instructed by the county committee to go to the countryside to educate the masses to be frugal during festivals, but they took the lead in eating and drinking extravagantly, resulting in the slaughter of two hundred oxen for a festival in one district alone. Some county-level leading cadres emphasized the uniqueness of their district and township and privately approved increases in grain supplies. Some Party member cadres do not speak their minds to the Party, knowing that some people are engaged in ethnic separatist activities but not reporting it to the Party.

	IV. In emphasizing the consideration of ethnic customs and characteristics, some people do not take the consolidation of the socialist system and the development of production as prerequisites, but emphasize consideration without analyzing whether the customs are good or bad. Some even restore undesirable customs and habits that have been abandoned by their ethnic group for many years. A few people, under the guise of considering customs and habits, engage in activities that oppose and undermine the socialist system. For example, in some areas of the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, "bullfighting," which had not been held for decades since the establishment of the prefecture, has been revived, changing from once every few years in the past to once every ten days or so now; some even use the public accumulation funds of the agricultural cooperatives to buy "fighting bulls." In some townships in Jianhe County, people have not eaten "Guzang" for fifty-seven years, but now it has been revived. Some ethnic cadres (including some Party members) use the excuse of considering ethnic characteristics to support families in withdrawing from the cooperative, demanding grain supplies, and demanding the return of "household oxen."

Zhou Lin further pointed out that the growth of local nationalism is a reflection of bourgeois nationalism on ethnic issues; the struggle between the nationalist stance and the socialist stance is essentially a component of the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. The main task currently before us is to consolidate the socialist system. The facts of the past few years have told us that without the leadership of the Communist Party, the emancipation of all ethnic groups would be impossible; without the mutual assistance and unity of all ethnic groups, without the help of the Han people, and without last year's socialist transformation, the future and destiny of the ethnic groups would be unimaginable. However, a few ambitious elements who seek to split ethnic unity attempt to abandon ethnic unity and socialist goals and pursue ethnic autonomy alone. Although these people wave the banner of the ethnic group and appear to be safeguarding ethnic interests, in essence, they are part of the bourgeois rightists. They not only violate socialist interests but also violate the interests of their own ethnic group. The destiny of the ethnic group cannot be entrusted to these ethnic traitors. Ethnic cadres, first and foremost, are Communist Party member cadres and should, together with the broad masses of the people, under the leadership of the Party, thoroughly crush the political conspiracies of all elements inside and outside the Party who attempt to split ethnic unity and oppose socialism, and extensively carry out socialist education movements among the ethnic masses, raise socialist awareness, overcome local nationalist thoughts, and work together in the big family of the motherland for the cause of socialism.

### 批判地方民族主义增进民族团结  贵州省委书记周林谈地方民族主义之害

    批判地方民族主义增进民族团结
    贵州省委书记周林谈地方民族主义之害
    新华社贵阳电　中共贵州省委第一书记、贵州省省长周林同志，2日在贵州省委召开的党内四级干部会议上作总结报告时说，近年来地方民族主义有了新的滋长，在许多地方已成为一种危险倾向的时候，我们在继续批判大汉族主义的同时，强调批判地方民族主义思想是完全必要的。对这种错误思想，如不加以严肃批判，将不利于社会主义和各民族间的团结。
    周林根据四级干部会议上对地方民族主义的揭露和批判，说明贵州省地方民族主义思想，目前主要表现在以下几个问题上：
    一、在民族关系上，忽视各民族互助团结共同建设祖国社会主义大家庭的这一条总路线，或者是不赞成这条总路线，而强调单一的民族自治。有些人错误地认为：只有建立单一的民族自治，才能有财权，才能发展本民族的经济和文化，才能培养本民族的干部。在某些多民族地区，也曾发生过互不信任，或错误地认为党厚此薄彼，重视这个民族，不重视那个民族，你那个民族干部多，我这个民族干部少等。
    二、在干部问题上，有些人存在着严重的排外情绪，他们只强调干部民族化，而不强调干部共产主义化。他们错误地认为：只有本民族干部，才能为民族谋福利。另外也有一些民族干部，被提拔以后，看不起汉族及其他民族干部。如当副职就心中不满意。
    三、在服从党的领导的问题上，部分担任政府工作的民族干部当中，不服从党委的统一领导，各搞一套的情绪在增长，甚至有的企图和党委分庭抗礼。有一部分担任县长的民族党员干部竟说：“县委以党代政，我们有职无权，政府某些部门是虚设。”个别更严重的还说：“人民选我当家，我没有作主。”另外还有一些党员干部（有的是县委委员），对县委的决议和指示不执行，各自为政。三都水族自治县个别县委干部，县委会指示他到农村去教育群众过节日时要节约，而他竟带头大吃大喝，结果一个区过一次节就杀了二百头耕牛。有个别的县级领导干部，强调本区本乡特殊，私自批准增加粮食供应。还有一些党员干部向党不说真心话，明知有一些人在搞民族分裂活动，而不向党反映。
    四、在强调照顾民族风俗习惯和民族特点方面，有些人不以巩固社会主义制度和发展生产为前提，而是不问风俗习惯的好坏，不加分析地强调照顾。有的还将已为本民族遗弃多年的不良风俗习惯加以恢复。还有少数人，以照顾风俗习惯为名，进行反对和破坏社会主义制度的活动。例如黔东南苗族侗族自治州的某些地方，自从建州以后，已几十年不进行的“斗牛”又恢复了，过去几年斗一次的，现在变为十几天斗一次了；有的还拿农业社的公积金买“斗牛”。剑河县有的乡已五十七年不吃“牯脏”，现在又恢复了。有一部分民族干部（包括一些党员），以照顾民族特点为借口，支持家庭闹退社，闹粮食供应，闹退“保家牛”。
    周林并指出：地方民族主义的滋长，是资产阶级民族主义在民族问题上的反映；民族主义立场和社会主义立场的斗争，实质上是社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的组成部分。目前摆在我们面前的主要任务，是巩固社会主义制度，过去几年来的事实已经告诉我们：没有共产党的领导，各民族的翻身是不可能的；没有各民族的互助团结，没有汉民族的帮助，没有去年的社会主义改造，民族的前途和命运，是不可想像的。但是，有少数分裂民族团结的野心分子，企图离开民族团结和社会主义目标，单独搞民族自治，尽管这些人打着民族旗帜，以维护民族利益的面貌出现，但实质上他们是资产阶级右派的一部分，他们不仅违背了社会主义利益，同时也违背了本民族的利益。民族的命运是不能掌握在这些民族败类手中的。各民族干部首先是共产党员干部，应和广大人民一起，在党的领导下，彻底粉碎党内外一切企图分裂民族团结和反社会主义分子的政治阴谋，在民族群众中广泛地开展社会主义教育运动，提高社会主义觉悟，克服地方民族主义思想，在祖国大家庭中互助团结，为社会主义事业共同努力。
