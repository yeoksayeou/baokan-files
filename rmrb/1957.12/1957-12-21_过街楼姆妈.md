    "Auntie Over the Overpass Building"
    Li Xin
    Shanghai has a habit: neighbors generally don't call each other by name or anything else, but according to the room each person lives in and their status in the family, such as "Auntie in the Front Building," "Sister-in-law in the Garret," "Older Sister in the Kitchen Alcove," etc. Living in the overpass building in our lane is an old woman in her sixties, whom everyone calls "Auntie Over the Overpass Building."

    I became acquainted with "Auntie Over the Overpass Building" on the very first day I moved into this lane. That afternoon, I took a pedicab with household goods, and just as I entered the lane, an old woman with white hair and neat clothes came up and asked, "Are you the Li family father moving into number seven?" I was surprised how this old woman knew so much detail and replied, "Yes, that's right." She followed behind the pedicab, saying with a bit of a reproachful tone, "Moving should always be done in the morning. I thought you'd be moving in this morning."

    When I got upstairs, I saw the room was cleaned spotlessly, the floor was scrubbed, and the windows were wiped. Who cleaned this up? A sister-in-law from the back building seemed to see what I was thinking and said admiringly, "You don't need to bother, 'Auntie Over the Overpass Building' said your whole family works in government offices and couldn't find time to clean, so she cleaned it up for you. Ours..." This sister-in-law was about to continue when "Auntie Over the Overpass Building" frowned and waved her hand, so she didn't continue. Just as I was about to thank this auntie, she came over, pointed, and said to me, "Li family father, how are you planning to arrange the room? A family of three used to live here, with a lot of furniture, arranged very messily. You're just a couple, and you need to come back at night to read and write. Luckily, you don't cook, so the bed can be placed here, and the desk can be placed facing the window..." She was so thoughtful. I listened to her, full of energy, talking and gesturing with her hands, and I thought she must be tired, so I'd ask her to sit down and rest after she finished. Who knew she'd say, "Okay, there will be many more times to come, I have things to do, see you tomorrow," and left, walking so lightly, not like an old person at all. I watched her leave, then turned back to look at the room, feeling warm in my heart. I didn't expect to meet such a warm-hearted person as soon as I came here!

    Not long after moving into the new house, one night, it was a cold winter night with snow, and the rooftops and roads were covered with a thick layer of snow. I was running home alone after a meeting, one foot high, one foot low, and just as I was entering the lane, the sound of a copper bell and a shout came with the wind: "Residents, please be careful with fire! Don't have sparks in your stoves! Coal briquette stoves cannot be used for heating, as they can cause carbon monoxide poisoning! Cover the children's blankets well, so they don't catch a cold..." Then there was another sound of the copper bell, getting closer and closer. After walking only a few steps, a dark figure was in front of me. This person was draped in a large burlap sack, with one hand on a cane and one hand holding a copper bell. I went up to him and, by the light of the snow, saw it was "Auntie Over the Overpass Building"! As soon as she saw me, she said, "Li family father, you're back so late? Your sister-in-law is anxiously waiting for you." With that, she walked past. I turned my head to look at her, and she rang the bell again and shouted, "Residents, please be careful..."

    One Sunday, I heard someone shouting outside the window: "Residents, quickly take in your clothes, it's going to rain!" As soon as I heard it, I knew it was "Auntie Over the Overpass Building" again. My wife opened the window and saw that the sky had indeed changed color. I thought, how can this old woman care about others so much all the time? I heard from the neighbors that she is the welfare committee member of the residents' committee. If an old lady in someone's family is sick and no one is there to take care of her, she goes over, takes care of all the housework, and even brings her bedding to stay with the patient overnight! If someone's daughter-in-law has a baby, she comes to take care of her for a month or so and doesn't want a penny. She knows everything about the population, economic situation, etc., of every household in the entire lane. I decided to visit her, even though I'm not used to visiting people.

    As soon as I walked up to the overpass building, I saw her sitting at the window, wearing old-fashioned glasses and knitting a woolen sweater. As soon as she saw me, she took off her glasses and said, "Li family father, are you resting at home today?" As soon as I sat down, she handed me a glass of boiled water and picked up the woolen yarn, saying to me, "Young people don't know how to plan. The children's winter clothes should have been prepared long ago. Even now, um, you still won't let me knit them. You can't let the children freeze." I thought she was blaming her own daughter, so I asked, "Are you talking about your daughter?" She said, "My daughter doesn't have children yet, I'm talking about the sister-in-law in the kitchen alcove at number nine. It's no wonder, she works in a factory and doesn't have time to take care of these things."

    The old woman is a talkative and straightforward person. I didn't have to ask her much; she told me about her life. She worked in a textile factory from a young age and retired two years ago. She only has one daughter who now works in a textile factory. She has always lived here and has established deep feelings with the residents here. The factory allocated her a worker's residence, but she preferred to give it up rather than leave here. She said, "The people living in our lane are all workers, many of them are young couples, and they all call me 'Auntie,' as if they are all my children. Young people don't know how to manage their homes, how can I feel at ease if I move away? Besides, at eighty years old, you become the top scholar in the imperial examination. I am a cadre elected by everyone. Everyone says not to let me go, how can I leave them? I wouldn't feel at ease even if I left!" Yes, the people here don't want her to leave, even I, a new resident, feel the same way.

### “过街楼姆妈”

    “过街楼姆妈”
    李新
    上海有这么一个习惯：邻居之间一般不呼唤名字或别的，而是根据各人住的房间和在家中的地位来称呼的，如“前楼阿姨”、“亭子间嫂嫂”、“灶披间阿姐”等，我们弄堂的过街楼上住的是一位六十来岁的老大妈，大家都喊她“过街楼姆妈”。
    我搬进这条弄堂的第一天就和“过街楼姆妈”混熟了。那天下午，我带着家用杂具坐了一部三轮车，刚进这弄堂，一位头发花白穿着利索的老大妈迎上来问：“是搬进七号里来的李家爸爸？”我奇怪这位老大妈怎么知道得这样详细，回答说：“哎，是呀。”她就跟在车后来了，带点责备的口气说着：“搬场嘛总该在早上，我还当你们早上就搬来呢。”
    到了楼上，我见屋里打扫得干干净净，地板刷过了，窗也揩过了，这是谁收拾的？后楼的一位嫂嫂仿佛看出了我的心事，夸赞地说：“你用不着忙了，‘过街楼姆妈’说是你们一家子都在机关里工作，抽不出空来打扫，她就给你们收拾妥贴了，我们的……”这位大嫂还要往下说，“过街楼姆妈”不高兴地努努嘴摆摆手，她才没说下去。我正要开口感谢这位姆妈时，她正走过来指划着对我说了：“李家爸爸，你打算房间怎么个摆设法？以前这里住的是一家三口的，家具多，摆设得很杂乱，你们只夫妻俩，晚上得回来看看写写的，好在不烧饭吃，床可以放在这，书桌放在迎窗口……”她想得真周到，我听着她神采奕奕地说着还用手比划着，心想，她该累了，等她说完时就招呼她坐会歇歇，谁知她说了声：“好，往后来的时候多呢，我还有事情去，明天会。”就走了，走得那么轻快，一点不像上了年纪的人，我目送她走后，回过头来看看这房间，心里热呼呼的，想不到一来这儿就遇上这么一位热心肠的人！
    搬进新居不久的一天晚上，是一个寒冬的雪夜，屋顶道路都盖上了厚厚的一层雪。我开完会一个人往家里跑着，一脚高一脚低，正走进弄堂的时候，随风吹来阵阵铜铃声和喊声：“居民们注意啦，火烛要小心，炉子里不要有火星，煤球风炉不能取暖，那样会中煤气毒的，孩子的被头要盖好，不要着凉……”接着又是一阵铜铃声，声音越来越近了，走不了几步，一个黑影已到我的前面，这个人披着一个大麻袋，一只手拄根拐杖，一只手拎着个铜铃，我迎上去借着雪的闪光一看，原来是“过街楼姆妈”！她一见是我，就开口了：“李家爸爸这晚才回来？你嫂嫂等得你心焦了。”说着她就走过去了，我转过头来望着她，她又摇着铃喊起来了：“居民们注意……”
    有一个礼拜天，听得窗外在喊：“居民们，快收衣服呀，要下雨了。”我一听就知道又是“过街楼姆妈”，妻子开窗一看，果然天色变了，我想，这位老大妈怎么会这样时刻关心着别人？听邻居说，她是居民委员会的福利委员，谁家老太太病了家里没人照应她就去了，一切家务事包下来，甚至把被头搬来陪病人过夜！谁家媳妇生孩子了她来服侍上个把月而且不要一个钱，整条弄堂每一户人家的人口、经济等情况她都一清二楚。我决定去访问她一下，虽然我是不习惯串门子的。
    一走上过街楼，见她坐在窗口，戴着老光眼镜在编结绒线衣，一看见我，她就取下眼镜说：“李家爸爸今天礼拜在家休息？”我刚坐下，她递来了一杯开水，又拿起那绒线对我说：“年轻人就不知道盘算，孩子的冬衣早该准备啦，一直到今天，嗯，还不肯让我结，那不能让孩子冻着呀。”我当她在责备自己的女儿呢，就问：“你是说你女儿？”她说：“我女儿还没孩子呢，这是说九号灶披间嫂嫂。也难怪，她在厂里做工，没闲工夫来料理这些事呀。”
    老大妈是个健谈而爽直的人，我不费多大劲问她，她就把自己的身世告诉了我，她从小在纺织厂做工，前年退休的，只有一个女儿现在纺织厂做工，她一直住在这里，和这里的居民建立了深厚的感情，厂里分配她工房，她情愿放弃也不离开这里，她说：“我们这弄里住的都是工人，不少是年轻的夫妻，都叫我姆妈，好像都是我的儿女，年轻人不会料理家务，我搬走了怎能放心下来？再说，八十岁中状元，我是大家选出来的个干部，大家都说不让我走，我怎么可离开他们走呢？走了也不放心呀！”是的，这里的人都不愿她离开，就连我这个新来的居民也是这样。
