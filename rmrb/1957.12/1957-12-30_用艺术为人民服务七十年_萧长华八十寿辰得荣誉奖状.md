Serving the People with Art for Seventy Years
Xiao Changhua Receives Honorary Certificate on His Eightieth Birthday

The Chinese Opera School held a grand meeting in Beijing on the 28th to celebrate the eightieth birthday of the school's vice-principal, the famous Peking Opera artist Xiao Changhua, and his seventy years of stage life.

Yan Yong, the principal of the Chinese Opera School, spoke at the beginning of the commemorative meeting. He said that Mr. Xiao Changhua has been engaged in stage life for seventy years and in art education for fifty-four years. Since liberation, he has made outstanding contributions to opera education. He has taught no less than a thousand students throughout the country and can be described as having students all over the world.

Liu Zhiming, Vice Minister of Culture, presented the honorary certificate to Xiao Changhua on behalf of the Ministry of Culture.

Liu Zhiming, Vice Minister of Culture, delivered a congratulatory speech at the meeting, saying that Xiao Changhua is an artist, an educator, and also a son of the working people. He has served the working people with his art throughout his life and has never lost contact with the people for a moment. His excellent qualities of the working people are particularly worthy of learning by literary and art workers. Liu Zhiming said that Xiao Changhua is brave and firm politically and distinguishes between loyalty and treachery. Through artistic performances, he made a relentless satire of the darkness and ugliness of the old society. He wholeheartedly loves the Communist Party, and in the anti-Rightist struggle, he resolutely fought back against the conspiracies of the Rightist elements. He is innovative in art and art education. His performing art combines the strengths of various schools and has its own unique style. Opera workers should learn from his spirit of inheriting and carrying forward the tradition of national opera art, learn from his humility and selflessness, oppose certain conservative tendencies in the reform of opera art and the undesirable style of some actors highlighting themselves, so that Peking Opera art can be more prosperous.

Tian Han, Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, Mei Lanfang, Director of the Chinese Opera Research Institute, and Lao She, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, also spoke successively.

Xiao Changhua delivered a reply speech at the end. He said, "I have lived for eighty years and have experienced several dynasties. Only in the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can artists receive such respect and honor. I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, who truly care about us artists." He said, "Now I am truly relieved that the country has invested huge human and financial resources to establish an unprecedented opera school. Why worry that opera art cannot be passed on to future generations?" In his speech, Xiao Changhua earnestly exhorted the younger generations: "Artistic skill is not as good as moral character. We must recognize the right path, honestly serve the people, and wholeheartedly learn our skills." He also said that although he is eighty years old, he is not considered old in today's society and must follow the advanced, strengthen learning, and work for the socialist cause to the end.

    用艺术为人民服务七十年
    萧长华八十寿辰得荣誉奖状
    中国戏曲学校28日在北京举行大会，庆祝这个学校的副校长、著名京剧艺术家萧长华八十寿辰和他从事舞台生活七十年。
    中国戏曲学校校长晏甬在纪念会开始时讲了话。他说，萧长华先生从事舞台生活七十年，从事艺术教育也有五十四年。解放后，他在戏曲教育工作上有过卓越的贡献。他生平所教的学生不下千人，遍布全国，可称得起桃李满天下。
    文化部副部长刘芝明代表文化部将荣誉奖状授给了萧长华。
    文化部副部长刘芝明在会上致贺词说，萧长华是艺术家、教育家，而且是劳动人民的儿子。他一生以他的艺术为劳动人民服务，没有一时一刻同人民失掉联系。他的优良的劳动人民的品质特别值得文艺工作者学习。刘芝明说，萧长华在政治上勇敢坚定，明辨忠奸。通过艺术表演，对旧社会的黑暗和丑恶进行了无情的讽刺。他衷心爱戴共产党，在反右派斗争中对右派分子的阴谋，进行了坚决的反击。在艺术上和艺术教育工作上，他富于革新精神。他的表演艺术兼收各家之长，又独具风格。戏曲工作者应当学习他这种善于承继并发扬民族戏曲艺术传统的精神，学习他谦虚、忘我的品质，反对在戏曲艺术改革上的某些保守倾向和有的演员突出个人的不良作风，使京剧艺术更加繁荣。
    中国戏剧家协会主席田汉、中国戏曲研究院院长梅兰芳、北京市文联主席老舍也相继讲了话。
    萧长华最后致答词。他说，我活了八十岁，经历过好几个朝代，只有在共产党、毛主席领导下的新中国，艺人才能得到这样的尊敬和荣誉。谨向真正关怀我们艺人的共产党和毛主席表示深深的感激。他说，现在我真正放了心，国家出了巨大的人力财力建立前所未有的戏曲学校，何愁戏曲艺术不能传宗接代。萧长华在讲话中谆谆嘱告后辈们：艺高不如德高，要认清正路，老老实实为人民服务，一心一意地学本领。他还表示，他虽已八十岁，但在今天的社会里还不算老，一定要跟随先进，加强学习，为社会主义事业工作到底。（附图片）
    参加今天纪念会的有一千多人。著名京剧艺术家梅兰芳、姜妙香、雷喜福、侯喜瑞等今天晚间还演出了拿手好戏。
