　　Striving to Achieve "Four, Five, Eight"
　　——Record of the National Conference on Agricultural Mechanization of Farmland Irrigation and Drainage Machinery
　　
    At the National Conference on Agricultural Mechanization of Farmland Irrigation and Drainage Machinery, the figures requested by various regions for the supply of irrigation and drainage power machinery in 1958 rose several times. Before the conference, the total horsepower required nationwide was 530,000, but it later rose to 1,120,000. This is an ordinary figure, but it is equal to more than twice the total number of agricultural power machinery currently in the country! The originally planned supply of more than 1,400 tractors next year is far from meeting the needs of various regions. Thirteen provinces and cities, including Hebei, have requested an increase of nearly 2,700 units. Representatives from Inner Mongolia, Qinghai and other places reflected that pastoral areas also urgently need mowing, cutting, and other machinery, and some local representatives also reflected that people in mountainous areas also urgently need machinery.

    Why Do We Need Machines When We Have So Many People?

    China is characterized by a large population and little cultivated land. Why do various regions need so many machines? It is precisely for this reason that we need to increase the yield per unit area and increase grain production. After agricultural cooperation, the development of agriculture and sideline production has brought about new situations in rural areas throughout the country. Especially after the Third Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee this year and the promulgation of the Forty Articles of the Program for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft), a new upsurge in agricultural production has begun across the country. During the busy farming season, many places feel a shortage of labor. Even in densely populated areas, well-managed cooperatives also experience a shortage of labor during the busy farming season.

    Agricultural production depends on both favorable geographical conditions and favorable weather conditions, and is highly seasonal. Sometimes a difference of one day can lead to reduced production. As farmers say, "The seasons wait for no one." Proverbs say: "When jujube buds sprout, plant cotton," "Spring Equinox, wheat enters the soil," "When willow catkins are abundant, transplant rice seedlings," "Around Grain Rain, sow melons and beans," "Barley and peas must be sown before the ninth day of the lunar month," "After Mango Planting, do not rush to plant," etc., all illustrating that farmers understand the importance of seizing the farming season. The main reason for wanting machines is to seize the farming season and increase the yield per unit area. In the Yangtze River Basin, to grow double-cropping rice well, farmers say it is best to achieve "early yellow, late green," that is, to harvest early rice in the morning and transplant late rice in the evening. If the season can be caught and the farming season seized, it is possible to change from growing one crop to growing two or even three crops in areas that originally grew one crop. Nanli Village, Mengzhuang, Huixian County, Henan, is an example. They use the method of raising rice seedlings to cultivate grain seedlings before harvesting wheat, irrigate and transplant rice seedlings after harvesting wheat, plant cabbage and radishes after harvesting grain, and then plant wheat again after the vegetables are ripe. Therefore, many fields with an annual yield of 1,000 kilograms of grain and 10,000 kilograms of vegetables per mu have appeared there. On the North China Plain, changing from one crop to two crops concentrates the busiest time of the year to about 60 days: 20 days from harvesting wheat to autumn planting, and 40 days from autumn harvest to planting wheat. During this period, harvesting, planting, and irrigation all require a lot of labor. In the Yangtze River Basin, the gap between double-cropping rice is only a few days to 20 days. During this period, harvesting, plowing, harrowing, fertilizing, and transplanting are all very intensive. Because they are too busy, some areas that could be replanted have to be left unplanted, or although they are planted, the yield is reduced due to missing the season. In some places, there are not enough livestock for plowing, so people have to pull plows. In the Longyao area of ​​Xingtai, this spring there were more than 58,000 people pulling plows to cultivate the land. People in northern Anhui also pull plows very commonly. Also, due to insufficient manpower, only one-third of the grasslands in Inner Mongolia are currently being utilized, which affects the development of livestock.

    The Key to Increased Production Lies in Water

    Our ancestors understood the benefits and harms of water for agricultural production, so the moving story of Yu the Great controlling the floods is widely circulated among the Chinese people. However, even now, water is still an untamed wild horse for us. Every year, nearly tens of millions of mu of cultivated land suffer from varying degrees of drought and flood. Although China's water resources are very abundant, the total area of paddy fields and irrigated land in China is only one-quarter of the cultivated land. The Forty Articles of the Agricultural Program require that within twelve years, the yield per mu should reach 400, 500, and 800 kilograms respectively from north to south. To achieve this goal, in addition to applying more fertilizer and intensive cultivation, the key lies in water. In order to achieve this goal, the recently held National Planning Conference has determined that the area of farmland irrigation will increase by nearly 100 million mu next year.

    A North China proverb says: "Eighty-three rains for the wheat harvest." The meaning is that if there are three rains in August, October, and March of the following year, the wheat harvest will be good. Those who study agricultural production increases believe that with fertilizer, five irrigations for wheat and three irrigations for cotton can achieve a bumper harvest. It can be seen that water is the key to increasing production. Some people jokingly say: To achieve four, five, eight, we must first implement "restriction, utilization, and transformation" of water. Therefore, amidst the calls for agricultural mechanization, the call for irrigation and drainage machinery is the highest.

    Tuanbowa in Tianjin has 470,000 mu of land. Due to the low terrain, low-lying areas are often flooded, and high-lying areas are often leached with alkali, and the average yield per mu is only a dozen kilograms. Later, a pumping station was established here, and canals were built to not only remove accumulated water, but also use fresh water to wash away alkali soil. As a result, this year the yield per mu has reached an average of 449 kilograms. The Shanxi representative attending this meeting said: Shanxi suffered a severe drought this year. After many places used mechanical water lifting, they guaranteed production. Therefore, farmers say that with water pumps and locomobiles, there is no worry about cotton or rice. The representative of Gansu Province reflected that Jingyuan County and Sanhe Township could not sow seeds due to drought before the establishment of the pumping station. After the station was established, some cotton reached a yield of 180 kilograms of lint per mu, and some wheat reached 1,000 kilograms. The Shijiazhuang area of ​​Hebei Province also achieved records of 1,000 kilograms of wheat and 400 kilograms of cotton due to good irrigation. The key to Nanli Village in Huixian being able to grow three crops a year also lies in irrigation. They implemented the method of "three fertilizers and five irrigations," that is, applying fertilizer three times and irrigating five times, so they achieved high yields.

    Last year, the area of ​​cultivated land benefited from mechanical irrigation and drainage in China was 17 million mu, and this year it is estimated to exceed 20 million mu. According to the materials provided at the conference, in rice areas, irrigation with water pumps can increase the yield per mu from tens of kilograms to more than one hundred kilograms. If two crops are changed to three crops, the yield can be increased by 200 to 300 kilograms. In barren alkaline land or arid areas, pumping water to improve the soil or plant rice can increase the yield per mu from 200 to more than 500 kilograms. In cotton and wheat producing areas, irrigation can generally increase the yield of seed cotton by 30 to 50 kilograms or wheat by 50 to 150 kilograms. Draining water in low-lying areas, especially in polder rice areas along the river and lake, can ensure high and stable yields.

    Do We Need Livestock and Machines?

    This winter, mass movements to build farmland water conservancy have been launched throughout the country. This movement will continue to unfold in the future. Thus, a large number of machines for draining and watering are needed. Currently, animal-powered waterwheels and human-powered waterwheels are used the most, but they are inefficient and costly. According to a survey of seventeen villages in eleven counties in Henan, the ratios are as follows:

    Human-powered waterwheel irrigates 2 mu of land per day, with an irrigation cost of approximately 3.6 yuan per mu;
    Animal-powered waterwheel irrigates 3 mu of land per day, with an irrigation cost of approximately 2.5 yuan per mu;
    Locomobile (5 horsepower) with waterwheel irrigates 25 mu of land per day, with an irrigation cost of approximately 0.4 yuan per mu;
    Gas engine (3.5 horsepower) with waterwheel irrigates 40 mu of land per day, with an irrigation cost of approximately 0.11 yuan per mu;
    Gas engine (10 horsepower) with water pump irrigates 100 mu of land per day, with an irrigation cost of approximately 0.08 yuan per mu.

    It can be seen that lifting water by human and animal power is not only uneconomical, but also inefficient. If we only rely on human and animal power, it will be difficult to seize the farming season.

    Not only that. The grain consumption of one livestock is approximately equal to the food ration of two or three people. Taking Henan as an example, if all irrigable areas use livestock as power, 1 million livestock are needed. Based on an annual grain consumption of 600 kilograms per livestock, the annual grain consumption is 6 billion kilograms. If we add flour milling, we will need to add 300,000 to 400,000 donkeys. Not to mention that livestock breeding is very slow, even under the current situation of insufficient grain in China, it is impossible to rely solely on livestock breeding. Although we cannot relax our work on feeding, protecting, and breeding livestock in the slightest.

    In addition to being used for irrigation and drainage, power machinery can also be used for various sideline processing. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives have requested to purchase machines one after another. Xinyang area in Henan Province requested to order 4,000 units. Xinhua No. 1 Cooperative in Shangqiu has raised more than 10,000 yuan and requested to buy twelve 10-horsepower water pumps. Farmers in Anhui are buying gas engines everywhere, and if they don't have them, they want diesel engines and car engines.

    Mainly Develop Gas Engines

    In 1949, the total power of irrigation power equipment in the country was only 97,000 horsepower. This year, the power of irrigation power equipment has reached 540,000 horsepower. There are nearly 400 million mu of land in China suitable for developing mechanical irrigation and drainage. Among them, in addition to the 20 million mu that have already been developed, about 200 million mu rely on surface water irrigation or need drainage, and about 160 million mu rely on groundwater irrigation. If we calculate based on an average of 50 mu per horsepower, we need more than 7 million horsepower of power machinery.

    Before liberation, diesel engines were the most common type of agricultural power machinery. After liberation, electric motors, gas engines, and steam engines were added. According to relevant statistics: last year, diesel engines accounted for nearly 210,000 horsepower, electric motors accounted for more than 80,000 horsepower, gas engines accounted for nearly 100,000 horsepower, and steam engines (i.e., locomobiles) accounted for nearly 30,000 horsepower.

    These types of power machinery each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Based on the current conditions of scarce oil and steel in China, we should mainly develop gas engines.

　　为了实现“四、五、八”
　　——记全国农田排灌机械农业机械化会议
　　新华社记者　田林
    在全国农田排灌机械及农业机械化会议上，各地要求供应1958年排灌动力机械的数字涨了几次。在会议以前，全国需要的马力数是五十三万匹，后来一直上涨到一百一十二万匹。这是一个普通数字，它却等于目前全国所有的农业动力机械总数的两倍还多呢！原定明年供应一千四百多台拖拉机的数字，也远远不能满足各地的需要。只河北等十三个省市就提出要增加近二千七百台。内蒙古、青海等地代表反映牧区也迫切地需要打草、切草等机械，有些地方的代表还反映山区人民也迫切要求机械。
    为啥人多还要机器？
    我国的特点是人多耕地少，为什么各地还要那么多机器呢？正是因为这个缘故，所以要提高单位面积产量，增产粮食。农业合作化以后，农业和副业生产的发展，使我国农村普遍出现了新情况。特别是在今年中共中央三中全会和发展农业的四十条纲要（修正草案）发布以后，一个农业生产的新高潮就在全国各地开始出现了。在农忙季节，许多地方都感到劳力不足。就是在人口稠密的地区，经营较好的合作社，农忙时，劳动力也很不足。
    农业生产既要靠地利，又要靠天时，季节性很大，有时差一天也要减产。用农民的话说就是“节气不饶人”。农谚说：“枣芽发，种棉花”、“春分麦入土”、“柳毛穰穰下稻秧”、“谷雨前后点瓜种豆”、“大麦豌豆不出九”、“过了芒种，不可抢种”等等都说明农民非常了解抢农时的重要。要机器主要就是为了抢农时，提高单位面积产量。在长江流域，要把双季稻种好，农民说，最好能做到“早黄晚青”，即上午割早稻，晚上就插晚稻。如果赶得上季节，抢得了农时，原来种一季的地方就可以改种两季甚至三季。河南辉县孟庄南李村就是一个例子。他们在割麦前用养稻苗的方法育谷苗，割麦后灌水栽谷秧，收谷后种白菜、萝卜，菜熟后再种小麦。所以他们那里出现了不少每亩年产千斤粮、万斤菜的田地。在华北平原，改一熟为双熟，每年最忙的时间集中在六十天左右。即从割麦到秋种二十天，秋收到种麦四十天。在这个时期，又收又种，还要灌溉，劳动力就不够用了。长江流域，双季稻交替的空隙只有几天到二十天。在这期间，要收、耕、耙、施肥、插秧，所以非常紧张。因为忙不过来，有些可以复种的也就只好不复种，或者虽然种上了，又因失去天时而减产。有些地方耕地时牲口不够，只好由人来拉犁，邢台专区隆尧等三县，今春就有五万八千多人拉犁种地。皖北人拉犁也很普遍。也由于人力不够，内蒙古的草原，目前只利用了三分之一，影响了牲畜的发展。
    增产关键在于水
    我们的祖先就非常了解水对于农业生产的利和害，所以在我国人民中普遍流传着大禹治水的动人的故事。可是，直到现在水对于我们还是未完全降服的野马。每年差不多都有几千万亩耕地遭受到不同程度的旱灾和涝灾。我国水利资源虽很丰富，但是我国水田和水浇地一共还只有耕地的四分之一。农业纲领四十条要求在十二年内，从北到南，亩产量要分别达到四百、五百、八百斤的目标。要达到这个目标，除了多施肥和精耕细作外，关键就在于水。为了达到这个目标，最近召开的全国计划会议已确定明年农田灌溉面积增加近一亿亩。
    华北的农谚说：“麦收八十三场雨”。意思就是说八月、十月和来年三月有三场雨，麦子的收成就不错。研究农业增产的人士认为：有了肥料，麦子浇五次水，棉花浇三次水，就可以丰收。可见，水是增产的关键。有人诙谐地说：要实现四、五、八，首先就要对水实行“限制、利用、改造”的办法。正因此，在农业机械化声中，排灌机械的呼声就最高。
    天津团泊洼有四十七万亩地。由于地势低洼，低地经常被涝，高地又常浸碱，每亩平均产量只十多斤。后来这里建立了抽水站，修了渠，既排除积水，又用甜水来冲洗碱地，结果，今年亩产量已达到平均四百四十九斤。出席这次会议的山西代表说：今年山西大旱，许多地方使用机械提水后，保证了产量。所以农民都说有了水泵锅驼机，不愁棉花不愁米。甘肃省代表反映：靖远县三和乡建立抽水机站以前干旱无法播种，建站后，棉花有的达到亩产皮棉一百八十斤，小麦有的达到一千斤。河北石家庄地区也因为浇灌得好，出现了麦子一千斤，棉花四百斤的纪录。上述辉县南李村能够做到一年种三次，关键也在于灌溉。他们实行了“三肥五水”，即施三次肥，浇五次水的办法，所以达到了高产。
    去年，我国用机械灌溉排水受益的耕地，已有一千七百万亩，今年估计已超过二千万亩。根据会议提供的材料来看，在水稻区，用抽水机灌溉，每亩增产自几十斤到一百多斤。如改两季为三季，可增产二百到三百斤。在荒碱地或干旱地区，用抽水机抽水改良土壤或种植水稻，每亩增产自二百斤到五百多斤。在棉麦产区，由于灌溉，一般可增产籽棉三十到五十斤或麦子五十到一百五十斤。在低洼地区排涝，特别是沿江滨湖的圩田水稻地区排涝，能保证高产稳收。
    要牲口还要机器
    今年冬天，全国各地都已掀起群众性的兴修农田水利的运动。这一运动今后还将继续展开。这样，就需要大量排水和浇水的机具。目前，使用最多的兽力水车和人力水车，效率低，成本高。据河南十一个县十七个村的调查，比数如下：
    人力水车　每天浇地二亩每亩灌溉成本约三点六元；
    兽力水车　每天浇地三亩每亩灌溉成本约二点五元；
    锅驼机（五马力）带水车每天浇地二十五亩每亩灌溉成本约零点四元；
    煤气机（三点五马力）带水车每天浇地四十亩每亩灌溉成本约零点一一元；
    煤气机（十马力）带水泵每天浇地一百亩每亩灌溉成本约零点零八元。
    由此可见，人畜力提水不仅不经济，而且效率低，如果只靠人畜力，就难以抢农时。
    不仅如此。一头牲口耗用粮食约等于两三个人的口粮。以河南为例，如果可灌区全部用牲口作动力，需要牲口一百万头。就以每年每头牲口耗粮六百斤计算，年耗粮六十亿斤。如再加上磨面，就还要加三十到四十万头毛驴。且不用说牲口繁殖很慢，就是目前我国粮食不丰的情况下面，只靠繁殖牲口，也是不行的。虽然对于饲养、保护和繁殖牲畜的工作，我们并不能丝毫放松。
    动力机械除了使用于灌溉排水以外，还可以利用来作各种副业加工。因此，农业社纷纷要求购买机器。河南信阳专区要求订购四千台。商丘新华一社已集资一万多元，要求买十马力抽水机十二个。安徽农民到处收买煤气机，没有，柴油机、汽车引擎都要。
    主要发展煤气机
    1949年，全国灌溉动力设备一共只有九万七千马力，今年灌溉动力设备已达到五十四万马力。我国适于发展机械灌溉和排水的地区，近四亿亩。其中除已经发展的二千亩外，利用地上水灌溉或需排水的约二亿亩，靠地下水灌溉的约一点六亿亩。如按每马力平均负担五十亩计算，约需动力机七百多万马力。
    解放前，农业动力机械中以柴油机为最多。解放后，增加了电动机、煤气机和蒸气机。据有关方面统计：去年，柴油机近二十一万马力，电动机占八万多马力，煤气机近十万马力，蒸气机（即锅驼机）近三万马力。
    这几种动力机各有短长。根据目前我国石油少、钢铁少的条件来看，主要应该发展煤气机。
