Xinhua News Agency dispatch: On the eve of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, famous figures and media circles from various countries expressed their congratulations and support.

Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar told a TASS reporter that the solidarity of the Asian and African countries is of great significance for them to completely get rid of the shackles of colonialism. We believe that the Asian-African Solidarity Conference will play a major positive role in safeguarding the freedom and independence of all peoples in the world and consolidating universal peace.

The Indonesian Permanent Representative to the United Nations and former Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo sent a telegram to the Asian-African Solidarity Conference to express his congratulations.

Sastroamidjojo was the head of the Indonesian delegation to the Bandung Conference in 1955. In his congratulatory telegram, he said: "In the current world political situation, your meeting is indeed very timely. I am very pleased that only two years after the historic Bandung Conference, the people of Asia and Africa have become more aware of the necessity of Asian-African solidarity."

Abdoullah Gani, Vice-Chairman of the Indonesian National Committee, who once served as the Secretary-General of the Bandung Asian-African Conference, sent a telegram to the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, expressing his hope that the conference would achieve the greatest success.

Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Aidit said in a congratulatory telegram that the Indonesian people have great hopes for the conference, especially on the West Irian issue. Aidit hoped that the conference could take unified measures against foreign subversion activities that threaten Asia and Africa.

Soviet Peace Protection Committee Chairman and writer Tikhonov said in his congratulatory letter: The issue of peaceful coexistence has become a fundamental issue in world politics. The people of Asian and African countries are directly participating in solving this problem. Any expression of solidarity among the people of large and small countries in the East is of great significance for opposing colonialism and the threat of war.

Those who sent letters from the Soviet Union to congratulate the opening of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference also included Armenian Academy of Sciences President Ambartsumian, Azerbaijani Peace Protection Committee Chairman Topchubayev, and Kazakh Academy of Sciences President Satpayev, among others.

The Soviet Asian Countries Solidarity Committee published a bulletin to celebrate the opening of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference.

Soviet newspapers published articles and commentaries on the 26th to congratulate the opening of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference.

"Pravda" published an article written by Yevgeny Zhukov, saying that due to the victory of the national liberation struggle, many Asian and African countries have not only gotten rid of foreign oppression, but have also become a new, independent, and very powerful factor on the international political stage. Zhukov pointed out that historical experience proves that only the anti-imperialist national liberation movement can cooperate with the powerful socialist forces to ensure the fastest possible liberation from colonial dependence and exploitation. The development of socialism and the national liberation movement has greatly accelerated and will further accelerate the process of the collapse of imperialism.

"Izvestia" correspondents in Cairo wrote an article pointing out that the gathering of representatives of the two adjacent continents in Cairo is a symbol of the people of Asian and African countries joining hands and struggling together for their liberation and independence after overcoming all kinds of obstacles from the colonialists. The article concluded by pointing out that the Cairo Conference called for making the unity of the Asian and African people, who are striving for independence, even stronger.

Korean "Rodong Sinmun" said: The Asian-African Solidarity Conference will once again give the imperialists a heavy blow to their conspiracies in the Asian and African regions. "Rodong Sinmun" also said that the Korean people are confident that this conference will further develop the relationship of friendship and cooperation between the Asian and African people. An editorial in "Minju Choson" said that the people of Asian and African countries will never allow the imperialists' attempts to reverse the wheels of history to succeed; the convening of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, which represents more than half of the world's population, shows this firm determination of the people of Asian and African countries.

The Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" published an editorial on the 26th to congratulate the convening of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference. The editorial said that the Asian-African Solidarity Conference has great significance for the people of Asia and Africa and the people of the world.

    亚非人民欢呼亚非团结大会开幕
    各国公众舆论同声祝贺大会成功
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：在亚非团结大会召开的前夕，世界各国著名人士和舆论界纷纷表示祝贺和支持。
    叙利亚外交部长比塔尔对塔斯社记者谈到即将举行的亚非团结大会时说，亚非各国人民的团结对于它们彻底摆脱殖民主义的束缚具有重大意义。我们相信，亚非团结大会将在保障全世界各国人民的自由独立和巩固普遍和平方面起着重大的积极作用。
    印度尼西亚驻联合国常任代表、前印度尼西亚总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约致电亚非团结大会表示祝贺。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约是出席1955年万隆会议的印度尼西亚代表团团长。他在贺电中说：“在目前的世界政治局势之下，你们的会议的确是十分适时的。我感到十分高兴，因为在具有历史意义的万隆会议以后仅仅两年，亚非两洲人民已经更加了解了亚非团结的必要性。”
    曾经担任万隆亚非会议秘书长的印度尼西亚民族委员会副主席阿卜杜加尼打电报给亚非团结大会，表示希望大会获得最大的成就。
    印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地在贺电中说，印度尼西亚人民对大会寄予很大的希望，特别是在西伊里安问题上。艾地希望大会能够对威胁亚非两洲的外国颠覆活动采取统一的措施。
    苏联保卫和平委员会主席、作家吉洪诺夫在贺信中说：和平共处的问题已经成为世界政治的一个根本问题。亚非各国人民正在最直接地参与解决这个问题。东方大小国家的人民团结的任何表现都对反对殖民主义和战争威胁具有重大的意义。
    苏联去信祝贺亚非团结大会开幕的还有亚美尼亚科学院院长阿姆巴楚米安，阿塞拜疆保卫和平委员会主席托普奇巴耶夫，哈萨克科学院院长萨特帕耶夫等人。

    苏联报纸26日发表文章和评论祝贺亚非团结大会开幕。
    “真理报”发表叶夫根尼·茹科夫写的文章说，由于民族解放斗争的胜利，亚非许多国家不仅摆脱了外国的压迫，而且变成了国际政治舞台上的一种新的、独立的和非常有力的因素。茹科夫指出，历史经验证明，只有反帝国主义的民族解放运动同强大的社会主义力量合作，才能保证最迅速地摆脱殖民地附属地位和剥削。社会主义和民族解放运动的发展大大加速了、而且还要进一步加速帝国主义崩溃的过程。
    “消息报”驻开罗的记者们写的文章指出，两个毗邻大洲的代表们共聚开罗，是亚非各国人民在克服了殖民主义者的百般阻挠之后携起手来为自己的解放和独立而共同斗争的象征。文章最后指出，开罗会议要求把正在争取独立的亚非各国人民的团结一致变得更加坚强。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”说：亚非团结大会将再一次给予帝国主义者对亚非地区的阴谋以沉重的打击。“劳动新闻”还说，朝鲜人民确信，这个大会将使亚非人民之间进一步发展友谊和合作的关系。“民主朝鲜报”的社论说，亚非各国人民决不容许帝国主义者倒推历史的车轮的企图实现；代表着世界的过半数人口的亚非团结大会的召开，显示了亚非各国人民的这种坚定的决心。
    越南“人民报”26日发表社论，祝贺亚非团结大会的召开。社论说，这次召开的亚非团结大会对亚非人民和世界人民具有重大的意义。
