Notes
　　
　　Bases and Oil
　　The December 9th issue of the American "Newsweek" published a short article about Libya by columnist Linte Lai. The author said that the United States has three "interests" in Libya: first, bases; second, strategic location; and third, oil.
　　It seems that Linte Lai is relatively frank; but in reality, it is not so. The primary purpose of the American invasion of Libya is to seize oil, and the bases are only to protect oil "interests".

    基地和石油
    12月9日的美国“新闻周刊”登载了专栏作家林特莱关于利比亚的短文。作者说，美国在利比亚有三种“利益”：第一是基地，第二是战略地位，第三是石油。
    看来，林特莱算是比较坦白的了；其实不然。美国侵入利比亚的首要目的就是攫取石油，基地不过是为了保护石油“利益”而已。
