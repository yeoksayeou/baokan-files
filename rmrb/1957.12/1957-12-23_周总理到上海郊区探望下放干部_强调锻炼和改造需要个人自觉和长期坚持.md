Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 22nd: Premier Zhou Enlai today visited cadres transferred to the rural areas of Shanghai suburbs to participate in labor tempering and young students participating in agricultural production. At the same time, he learned in detail about the production in the suburban rural areas and the operation and management of the agricultural cooperatives. Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Secretariat and Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, and Wei Wenbo, Secretary of the Municipal Committee Secretariat, accompanied him.

    In the Liming Agricultural Cooperative in the western suburbs, Premier Zhou was immediately surrounded by transferred cadres and high school graduates as soon as he got out of the car. Premier Zhou walked and talked with everyone on the ridges, asking in detail about their labor, how many work points they earned, whether they read newspapers, and what difficulties they faced. Premier Zhou also looked at their palms to see if they had calluses. Premier Zhou also visited the transferred cadres' residences, and asked about their living conditions and family situations with concern.

    In the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative, Premier Zhou held a forum with more than fifty university graduates assigned there by the Academy of Sciences to participate in labor tempering, answering their questions such as "Why should intellectuals participate in physical labor tempering" and "How can they be considered transformed into working-class intellectuals."

    Premier Zhou said: Knowledge comes from labor. If intellectuals do not directly participate in physical labor, they will forget the fundamentals, despise physical labor, and oppose mental and physical labor. At the same time, they will not see the collective strength of the working people, become arrogant, and think that they are above everything else. As a result, they will become detached from the working people and will not be able to serve the working people wholeheartedly. Therefore, intellectuals must undergo long-term tempering, especially labor tempering, to cultivate a mass viewpoint and a labor viewpoint, so that physical and mental labor are combined, and collective wisdom and individual talents are combined. As for when one can be transformed into a working-class intellectual, this is not determined by any examination or leadership approval, but by whether one's thoughts and feelings are consistent with the working people, and whether one can serve the working people wholeheartedly. This is to be approved by the masses. Some people now think that going to the countryside for a few months to "gild" themselves makes them working-class intellectuals. That is formalism, and this kind of thinking is bourgeois ideology. Premier Zhou encouraged the young people, saying: You will definitely be more advanced than we are now in the future. You will enter the 21st century and participate in communist construction. The Party and the government have created a favorable environment for you, but it also requires personal awareness and long-term persistence. You must remember: if you don't move forward, you will be eliminated.

    Premier Zhou also inquired in detail about the production situation, the income and living conditions of the members, and the production plans for next year from the members and cadres of the two agricultural cooperatives. Ge A'mei, a female member of the Liming Cooperative in her fifties, told the Premier that she had risen from a poor peasant to an upper-middle peasant. Her family of four earned more than 700 yuan last year. She herself often carried loads of more than 130 jin and earned 200 work points per month. Ge A'mei was wearing a patched but very clean cloth jacket today. She is usually thrifty and saves her savings in the bank. Premier Zhou praised her as a model of thrift and diligence, and said that everyone should learn from her. Premier Zhou also visited Ge A'mei's family and took a group photo with her family.

    Premier Zhou also had cordial conversations with district and township cadres. He visited the location of the District Committee of the Communist Party located in the village, and learned that many district cadres were already spending half a day in the countryside doing labor and half a day working, believing that this was an effective measure to improve their work style and connect with the masses. Zhang Yuxiu, the female director of the Liming Cooperative, reported the specific plans for next year to Premier Zhou, and told Premier Zhou: With the support of the Party and the government, we have full confidence in realizing the forty-article program (draft) for developing production at an early date. Premier Zhou believed that this spirit of courageous advancement was extremely important for every cadre.

    周总理到上海郊区探望下放干部
    强调锻炼和改造需要个人自觉和长期坚持
    新华社上海22日电  周恩来总理今天到上海郊区农村探望下放参加劳动锻炼的干部和参加农业生产的青年学生，同时详细了解了郊区农村的生产和农业社的经营管理情况。中共上海市委书记处第一书记柯庆施，书记处书记、上海市副市长曹荻秋、市委书记处书记魏文伯等陪同前往。
    在西郊区的黎明农业社，周总理一下车，就被下放干部和中学毕业生围住了。周总理和大家在田埂上边走边谈，详细询问他们劳动的怎么样？得多少工分？看不看书报？有什么困难？周总理还看他们的手掌有没有老茧。周总理还看了下放干部的住处，关心地询问他们的生活情况和家庭情况。
    在曙光农业社，周总理跟科学院分配在那儿参加劳动锻炼的五十多个大学毕业生举行了座谈，解答他们提出的“知识分子为什么要参加体力劳动的锻炼”，“怎样才算改造成工人阶级的知识分子”等问题。
    周总理说：知识是从劳动中产生的，知识分子不直接参加体力劳动，就会忘记了根本，轻视体力劳动，把脑力劳动和体力劳动对立，同时会看不到劳动人民的集体力量，自高自大，以为自己高于一切，结果就脱离劳动人民，不可能全心全意地为劳动人民服务。所以知识分子要经过长期的锻炼，特别要经过劳动锻炼，培养起群众观点和劳动观点，使体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合，集体的智慧和个人的才能相结合。至于什么时候才能改造成为工人阶级知识分子，这不是通过什么考试或领导批准来决定的，而是看自己的思想感情是不是同劳动人民一致，是不是能全心全意为劳动人民服务，这是要由群众来批准的。现在有些人认为下乡几个月，“镀一下金”，就是工人阶级知识分子了，那是形式主义，这种想法就是资产阶级思想。周总理勉励青年们说：你们将来一定会比我们现在更进步，你们会进入二十一世纪，参加共产主义建设，党和政府替你们造成了有利的环境，但是还需要个人的自觉，并且要长期坚持。你们要记住：不前进，就要被淘汰。
    周总理还向这两个农业社的社员和干部们详细了解生产的情况、社员的收入和生活情况，以及明年的生产打算。黎明社五十多岁的女社员葛阿妹对总理说，她已经由过去的贫农上升为上中农了。她一家四口，去年收入七百多元。她自己还经常挑一百三十多斤的担子，每月挣二百多工分。葛阿妹今天穿着一件补了又补但是洗的很干净的布褂子，平时也克勤克俭，把积蓄储存在银行里。周总理称赞她是个勤俭持家的模范，并说大家都要向她学习。周总理还访问了葛阿妹的家庭，并且和她一家合影留念。
    周总理和区、乡干部们也进行了亲切交谈。他看了中共区委会迁在乡村中办公的地点，了解到许多区干部已经下乡半天劳动，半天工作，认为这是对改进作风、联系群众的有效措施。黎明社的女主任张裕秀向周总理汇报了明年的具体计划，并且向周总理说：党和政府这样支持我们，我们有充分信心早日实现发展生产的四十条纲要（草案）。周总理认为这种勇往直前的革命劲头，对每个干部都极重要。
