(Comprehensive report from our newspaper) Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The armed conflict between the residents of Ifni and the Spanish army, which began on the morning of the 23rd of this month, is still continuing. News reports say that the Spanish authorities' suppression of the Ifni residents' struggle to restore unification with Morocco is the fuse that ignited this armed conflict.

According to the Moroccan newspaper "Flag": The armed uprising people of Ifni have surrounded three villages near Sidi Ifni, the capital of this Spanish colony: Talaz, Ait Yemour, and Coleta. According to a telegram received on the 1st by Moroccan religious leader Khattabi in Cairo, the armed uprising people of Ifni seized nine strongholds in Ifni and Rio de Oro from the Spanish army.

In an attempt to crush the armed uprising of the Ifni people, the Spanish authorities have dispatched thousands of reinforcements to Ifni in the past few days, and on the 28th launched a general offensive against the Ifni uprising people from land, sea, and air. Spanish troops also deployed paratroopers in the battle.

Some Spanish troops even invaded Moroccan territory. Moroccan villages adjacent to the Ifni border were also subjected to barbaric bombing by the Spanish Air Force. More than two hundred peaceful Moroccan residents were killed.

Representatives of the Ifni uprising people issued a statement on the 1st, condemning the Spanish colonialists for using ten American-made military aircraft in the attacks launched in Ifni, southern Morocco.

Moroccan Crown Prince Moulay Hassan condemned the Spanish army's attacks on Moroccan territory in a radio broadcast on the 28th. He said that Ifni is Moroccan territory, and he demanded that the Ifni conflict be resolved through negotiations with the Spanish government.

Ifni is located on the Atlantic coast in southern Morocco, with an area of 741 square miles. Spain acquired this area under an agreement it signed in 1912 with France, which then ruled Morocco. After Morocco gained independence, Morocco had made more than one request for the return of Ifni. Prior to this armed conflict, Ifni residents had repeatedly engaged in bloody conflicts with Spanish garrisons in order to strive for unification with Morocco. In September of this year, at the initiative of Morocco, negotiations were held with Spain on the issue of returning Ifni. The negotiations were interrupted not long ago because Spain insisted on maintaining control over Ifni.

　　争取重归摩洛哥怀抱
　　伊夫尼人民武装起义
　  西班牙肆行镇压并侵入摩洛哥
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：从本月23日清晨开始的伊夫尼居民同西班牙军队之间的武装冲突仍在继续中。消息说，西班牙当局对伊夫尼居民争取和摩洛哥恢复统一的镇压，是这次武装冲突的导火线。
    据摩洛哥“旗帜报”报道：伊夫尼武装起义的人民已经包围了西班牙的这块殖民地的首府西迪伊夫尼附近的三个村庄——塔拉兹、艾特也姆尔和科莱他。据在开罗的摩洛哥宗教领袖哈塔比在1日收到电报说，伊夫尼武装起义的人民从西班牙军队手中夺取了伊夫尼和里约特俄罗的九个据点。
    为了企图摧毁伊夫尼人民的武装起义，西班牙当局在过去几天里增调了数千援兵来到伊夫尼，并且在28日从陆、海、空三方面向伊夫尼起义人民发动总进攻。西班牙军队在战斗中还出动了伞兵。
    一部分西班牙军队甚至侵入了摩洛哥的领土。邻近伊夫尼边界的摩洛哥村庄也遭到了西班牙空军的野蛮轰炸。两百多名摩洛哥和平居民被炸死。
    伊夫尼起义人民的代表1日发表谈话，谴责西班牙殖民者在摩洛哥南部伊夫尼发动的攻击中使用了十架美制军用飞机。
    摩洛哥王储穆莱·哈桑28日在广播中对西班牙军队袭击摩洛哥领土的行动提出了谴责。他说，伊夫尼是摩洛哥的领土，他要求同西班牙政府用谈判的方法解决伊夫尼冲突。
    伊夫尼位于摩洛哥南部沿大西洋岸，面积七百四十一方英里。西班牙根据它在1912年同当时统治摩洛哥的法国所签订的一项协定而取得了这一地区。在摩洛哥获得独立以后，摩洛哥曾经不止一次地提出过要求收回伊夫尼。在这次武装冲突之前，伊夫尼居民为了争取同摩洛哥合并就已经同西班牙驻军发生过多次流血冲突。今年9月在摩洛哥倡议下，就归还伊夫尼问题同西班牙举行了谈判，由于西班牙坚持对伊夫尼的控制权，谈判已经在不久前中断。
