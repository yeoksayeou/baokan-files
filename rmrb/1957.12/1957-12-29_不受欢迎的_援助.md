Notes

    Unpopular "Aid"
    The United States often postures as a "savior" who generously aids backward countries in developing their economies. What is the truth about this kind of aid? Everyone knows that the Philippines is the most tightly controlled by the United States, but even its Foreign Minister Serrano has grievances. On the 26th, during a conversation with a U.S. senator, he spoke his mind: "The many conditions attached to the U.S. foreign aid plan make it a weapon of American foreign policy, not a friendly plan to promote friendship." It is clear how unpopular the self-proclaimed U.S. foreign aid plan has become.

    不受欢迎的“援助”
    美国是经常以慷慨援助落后国家发展经济的“救世主”自居的。这种援助的真相究竟如何呢？谁都知道，菲律宾是受到美国控制最严密的，可是，连它的外交部长塞兰诺，也不无怨言。26日他在同美国一个参议员谈话时，说了真心话：“美国援外计划所附加的许多条件，使援外计划成为美国外交政策的武器，而不是一项促进友谊的亲善的计划”。可见美国自我吹嘘的援外计划，不受欢迎到了什么程度。
