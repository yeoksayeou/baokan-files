Xinhua News Agency report: A newly built and well-equipped shooting range in Shanghai held its first event on the 1st—the city's year-end shooting sports review competition. This shooting range can host shooting competitions with various guns within 100 meters. The shooting range has a total of thirty firing positions and is equipped with nighttime lighting. The trapezoidal grandstand next to the firing line can accommodate 600 spectators. The walls of the shooting range are covered with soft cement, which reduces the echo of gunfire and prevents bullet ricochets, ensuring safety.

　  上海新建一个射击场
    据新华社讯　上海新近建造的、设备完善的射击场、1日举行了第一次活动——全市射击运动年终校阅竞赛大会。这个射击场可以进行一百公尺以内各种枪的射击比赛。射击室共有三十个靶位，设有夜间照明设备。射击地线旁边的梯形看台，可容观众六百人。射击场的围墙，都敷上了松软水泥，它既能减小枪声的回音，又能避免子弹回击，保证安全。
