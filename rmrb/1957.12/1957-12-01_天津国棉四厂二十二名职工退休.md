　　Twenty-Two Workers of Tianjin State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 4 Retire

    (Our Dispatch) The Tianjin Fourth State-owned Cotton Textile Factory recently had twenty-two workers and staff retire.

    Before these veteran workers retired, the Party Committee, Trade Union, and administrative leaders of the Cotton Mill No. 4 had individual talks with each person to understand their opinions and difficulties. The Party Committee and Trade Union also sent representatives to visit their homes to understand their family life situation and finally made specific arrangements according to each person's different situation. For example, Xing Ruyi, a 68-year-old worker, worked for capitalists and landlords for four or five decades in the old society and didn't have money to marry. Although his economic conditions have improved since liberation, he is still single due to his advanced age. The factory has allowed him to live in the factory's collective dormitory after retirement and is providing care in his life. Li Kejian, a 66-year-old worker and Communist Party member who joined the Party before liberation, lives with his younger brother after retirement. He has adopted a son from his brother, and his later life will be comfortable and peaceful. On the day he left his production post, he excitedly said to everyone: "I have 52 years of work experience. In the old society, I worked all day long, and it was difficult to even support myself, so I never got married. Today, in the new society, I enjoy retirement benefits. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can we elderly people have this kind of happiness!"

    The retired old folks are still very concerned about production. Li Kejian often runs to the factory to guide his apprentices in their work, and the apprentices constantly visit him at his home.

　　天津国棉四厂二十二名职工退休
    本报讯　国营天津第四棉纺织厂最近有二十二名工人、职员退休。
    在这些老职工退休以前，棉纺四厂党委会、工会和行政领导人员同每个人都进行了个别谈话，了解了他们的意见和困难。党委和工会还派代表到他们家中访问，了解他们的家庭生活情况，最后根据每个人的不同情况做了具体安排。如六十八岁的老工人邢如义，在旧社会为资本家、地主干了四、五十年活，没有钱结婚，解放后虽然经济条件好了，但因年纪太大，仍没有结婚，现在是孤身一人。厂里便让他退休后住在工厂的集体宿舍里，在生活上加以照顾。六十六岁的老工人、解放前就入党的共产党员李克俭，退休后住在弟弟家里。他已向弟弟过继过来一个儿子，他的晚年生活将很舒适、安乐。离开生产岗位的那天，他兴奋地对大家说：“我有五十二年工龄，在旧社会整天干活，连养活自己都困难，所以始终没有结婚。今天在新社会，我享受到了退休养老的待遇。只有在共产党领导下，我们老年人才能有这种幸福！”
    已经退休的老人们，对生产还很关心。李克俭就经常跑到厂里来指点徒弟干活，徒弟们也不断到他家里去看他。
