Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 15th: Moscow newspapers on the 15th published a letter from the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Bulganin, to the Prime Minister of Denmark, H.C. Hansen. In the letter, Bulganin emphasized that the upcoming NATO meeting will decide on means and ways to further strengthen the arms race, and formulate new military strategic plans aimed at widely using atomic and hydrogen weapons. If the Danish government can adopt a position of not allowing the deployment of atomic weapons and rocket weapons within its borders, it would greatly promote the normalization of the international situation and help consolidate world peace, especially peace in the Baltic Sea region.

This letter from Bulganin was handed over to the Danish Prime Minister by the Soviet Ambassador to Denmark on the 14th. The letter analyzes the current international situation and puts forward specific measures to ease international tensions.

Bulganin suggested taking the non-use of nuclear weapons and the immediate cessation of experimental explosions of such weapons from January 1st next year as the first step in easing international tensions and building trust between countries.

Bulganin believes that the signing of a non-aggression treaty between the member states of the North Atlantic Alliance and the Warsaw Treaty Organization is another important measure to ease the current international tension. Therefore, he suggested that major powers not deploy any type of nuclear weapons in other countries (including Denmark). He said that if the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain could reach an agreement not to deploy nuclear weapons in East and West Germany, and the governments of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic could also reach an agreement not to produce and deploy such weapons in Germany, then Poland and Czechoslovakia, as their governments have already stated, will also not produce and deploy nuclear weapons within their borders. In this way, a vast area without atomic weapons will appear in Central Europe.

Bulganin pointed out that taking measures to stop the current war propaganda, developing trade between countries without any discrimination, and holding high-level representative talks between capitalist and socialist countries would also play a significant role in improving the international situation.

Bulganin concluded by saying that the Soviet government has put forward suggestions for improving the international situation and is also willing to study with the utmost goodwill the suggestions put forward by other countries aimed at safeguarding world peace, especially peace in Northern Europe.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 15th: According to TASS, Moscow, December 15th: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Bulganin, said in a letter to the Prime Minister of Greece, Constantine Karamanlis, that the so-called "mutual dependence" of the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization proposed by the US and British governments is to use the scientific, economic resources and manpower of other members of this group to serve the military and political plans of the US and Britain. From all aspects, the main purpose of the upcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council is to pass a resolution on deploying American rocket weapons and nuclear weapons on the territory of Western European countries, including Greece.

Bulganin's letter was handed over to the Greek Prime Minister on December 14th. Today, all Moscow newspapers published this letter.

Bulganin said in the letter that the role assigned to Greece by the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is actually to make it an accomplice in these plans. They intend to turn Greece into an "unsinkable aircraft carrier"; and under the conditions of modern warfare, Greece may become a military base for a certain military bloc of some countries, thus becoming a battlefield.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union expressed his hope in the letter that the Greek government would realize its responsibility for maintaining and consolidating peace and not embark on a path that would further sharpen the situation.

The letter pointed out that the planners of atomic war plans also proposed a plan to merge the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Baghdad Pact. These plans are dangerous. Once this new expanded group is established, Greece will be involved in military and political groups such as the Baghdad Pact; thus being involved in world conflicts for the benefit of other countries.

The Head of the Soviet Government once again mentioned: The Soviet Union suggests not using nuclear weapons and stopping all nuclear weapons tests from January 1st next year, even if it is only for a period of two or three years at the beginning. Bulganin wrote that the Soviet Union suggests that the United States and Britain should now agree not to store nuclear weapons in West and East Germany.

Bulganin expressed his hope that the Greek government would take the necessary measures to support these suggestions.

Bulganin also said that Greece can make many contributions to improving the situation in the Balkans and making the Balkans a truly peaceful region. The Head of the Soviet Government assured the Greek Prime Minister that in this noble cause, Greece will always receive the response and support of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union and the Soviet government.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 15th: According to TASS, Moscow, Moscow newspapers today published a letter from the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Bulganin, to the Prime Minister of Canada, John Diefenbaker. The letter expressed concern about the current international situation and hoped that the Canadian government could urge all countries to reach an agreement on the Soviet government's proposals to ease international tensions.

This letter was handed over to Diefenbaker by the Soviet Ambassador to Canada on the 13th.

In the letter, Bulganin pointed out that the plan to merge military groups such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Baghdad Treaty Organization in some form is contrary to the proposition of consolidating international peace and security. The Soviet government believes that, in the current situation, the vital interests of the people of all countries require all countries to recognize the principles of peaceful coexistence, mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, complete equality, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful resolution of problems and differences that arise.

Bulganin once again mentioned the Soviet government's proposals. He said that the Soviet government advocates that the governments of the United States and Britain, together with the Soviet government, undertake the obligation not to use atomic and hydrogen weapons, and immediately stop all types of nuclear weapons tests from January 1, 1958, and advocates that major powers not set up any type of nuclear weapons on the territory of other countries (including the territory of Canada). Bulganin said that there are reports that the issue of also deploying American atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons on Canadian territory and establishing bases for launching rockets with nuclear warheads is now being discussed. He pointed out that this will create a particularly dangerous situation for Canada in the event of a military conflict.

Bulganin pointed out that the Soviet government advocates taking measures to stop propaganda that creates mutual distrust and hostility through newspapers and radio stations, and advocates holding high-level talks between representatives of capitalist and socialist countries.

Bulganin believes that Canada has extensive international ties and should urge an agreement on the proposals put forward by the Soviet government. He also pointed out that Canada is one of the world's major producers of fissionable material, and it must be able to play a significant role in resolving the atomic issue and in promoting the conclusion of an agreement on using atomic energy solely for peaceful purposes.

Bulganin went on to say that the Soviet government has always advocated the extensive development of ties between Canada and the Soviet Union and normal trade without any artificial restrictions, and advocated making every effort to develop cooperation between the two sides in science and technology, culture and art, and other fields.

Bulganin finally hoped that the Canadian government would carefully study the opinions he expressed in the letter. He said that the Soviet Union is also prepared to study any opinions that the Canadian government intends to put forward regarding the normalization of the overall international situation or the improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and Canada.

　　布尔加宁写信给丹希加三国首脑
    希望支持苏联的和平主张
    要求拒绝在本国建立美国原子武器和火箭基地
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科各报15日发表了苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁写给丹麦首相汉森的信。布尔加宁在信中着重指出，即将召开的北大西洋公约组织会议将决定进一步加强军备竞赛的手段和道路，制订旨在广泛地利用原子武器和氢武器的新的军事战略计划。如果丹麦政府能够采取不准在本国境内配置原子武器和火箭武器的立场，那就将会在很大程度上促进国际局势的正常化，并且将有助于巩固世界和平，特别是波罗的海地区的和平。
    布尔加宁的这封信已经由苏联驻丹麦大使在14日转交给丹麦首相。信中分析了目前的国际局势，并且提出了缓和国际紧张局势的具体措施。
    布尔加宁建议以不使用核武器并且从明年1月1日起立即停止这种武器的试验性爆炸作为缓和国际紧张局势和建立各国之间信任关系的第一步。
    布尔加宁认为，北大西洋联盟和华沙条约组织的成员国之间签订互不侵犯条约是缓和当前国际紧张局势的另一个重要措施。因此，他建议，各大国不在他国（包括丹麦在内）境内配置任何类型的核武器。他说，如果苏联、美国和英国能够达成协议，不在东德和西德配置核武器，而且德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国政府也能就不生产和不在德国境内配置这种武器的问题达成协议，那末，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克将像它们的政府已经声明的那样，也将不生产和不在本国境内配置核武器。这样，在中欧就将会出现一个广阔的没有原子武器的地区。
    布尔加宁指出，采取措施停止目前的战争宣传、无任何歧视地发展各国间的贸易并且举行资本主义国家同社会主义国家高级代表会谈，这些也将对改善国际局势起重大的作用。
    布尔加宁最后说，苏联政府提出了改善国际局势的建议，同时也愿意以最大的善意研究其他国家所提出的旨在保障世界和平、特别是北欧和平的建议。
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在一封致希腊首相卡拉曼利斯的信中说，美英两国政府提出的所谓北大西洋公约组织成员国的“互相依赖主义”是要把这个集团的其他成员国的科学、经济资源和人力用来为美英两国的军事和政治计划服务。从各方面来判断，即将举行的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议的主要目的是要通过在包括希腊在内的西欧国家的领土上配置美国火箭武器和核武器的决议。
    布尔加宁的信已经在12月14日递交给希腊首相。今天莫斯科各报都刊登了这封信。
    布尔加宁在信中说，北大西洋公约组织领导人分配给希腊担任的角色实际上是让它充当这些计划的同谋者。他们打算把希腊变为“不沉的航空母舰”；而在现代战争的条件下，希腊有可能变为一些国家的某种军事集团的军事根据地，从而变为战场。
    苏联部长会议主席在信中表示希望希腊政府意识到自己对维护和巩固和平的责任，不要走上促使局势进一步尖锐化的道路。
    信中指出，原子战争计划的策划者还提出了一种把北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约合并起来的主张。这些计划具有危险性。一旦这个新的扩大的集团建立起来，希腊就会被卷入像巴格达条约等这样的军事政治集团；从而为了他国的利益而被卷入世界冲突。
    苏联政府首脑再次提到：苏联建议不使用核武器，并且从明年1月1日起停止各种核武器试验，开始时那怕是为期两三年也好。布尔加宁写道，苏联建议美国和英国现在就议定不在西德和东德境内存放核武器。
    布尔加宁表示希望希腊政府采取必要措施来支持这些建议。
    布尔加宁还说，希腊在使巴尔干形势好转和使巴尔干变为一个真正和平的地区方面能够作出很多贡献。苏联政府首脑向希腊首相保证，在这种崇高的事业中，希腊将永远会得到苏联各族人民和苏联政府的响应和支持。
    新华社莫斯科15日电　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科各报今天发表了苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁给加拿大总理迪芬贝克的信。信中对当前国际局势表示不安，并且希望加拿大政府能够促使各国就苏联政府提出的缓和国际紧张局势的建议达成协议。
    这封信已经由苏联驻加拿大大使于13日转交给迪芬贝克。
    布尔加宁在信中指出，有人计划把北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约组织等军事集团以某种形式合并到一起，这一计划是违背巩固国际和平和安全的主张的。苏联政府认为，在当前的情况下，各国人民的切身利益要求各国承认和平共处、互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、完全平等、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平解决所发生的问题和分歧等项原则。
    布尔加宁再一次提到苏联政府的建议。他说，苏联政府主张美国和英国两国政府同苏联政府一起承担不使用原子武器和氢武器的义务，并且从1958年1月1日起立即停止各种类型的核武器的试验，主张大国不在别国领土（包括加拿大的领土）上设置任何类型的核武器。布尔加宁说，有消息说，现在有人正讨论也在加拿大领土上配置美国原子武器和氢武器并建立发射带有核弹头的火箭的基地的问题。他指出，一旦发生军事冲突，这对加拿大将造成特别危险的局面。
    布尔加宁指出，苏联政府主张采取措施停止通过报纸和电台进行产生互不信任和敌对情绪的宣传，主张资本主义国家和社会主义国家的代表举行高级会谈。
    布尔加宁认为，加拿大有着广泛的国际联系，它应该促使就苏联政府提出的建议达成协议。他同时指出，加拿大是世界上分裂物质主要产地之一，它在解决原子问题方面，在促使达成关于使原子能仅仅用于和平目的的协议方面一定能起重大的作用。
    布尔加宁接着说，苏联政府一直主张广泛发展加拿大和苏联之间的联系和没有任何人为限制的正常贸易，并且主张尽力发展双方在科学技术、文化艺术和其他方面的合作。
    布尔加宁最后希望加拿大政府对他在信中所表示的意见予以仔细的研究。他说，苏联也准备研究加拿大政府打算提出的任何有关使整个国际局势正常化的意见或者是有关改善苏联和加拿大之间的关系的意见。
