In the preface to his book "The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State," Engels put forward a famous formula of historical materialism, namely, that the propagation of the human race and the production of the means of subsistence are equally causes that determine the development of society and social systems. Some people in theoretical circles believe that Engels's formula is "inaccurate," "imprecise," even "replacing the monistic viewpoint with a dualistic viewpoint," "destroying the monistic view of history," and so on. However, others believe that such a conclusion about Engels's formula is incorrect. Recently, Luo Gengmo published an article entitled "A Study on a Classic Formula of Historical Materialism" in the fifth issue of "Philosophical Research," exploring this principle.

Luo Gengmo believes that to understand the correctness of this formula, one must first have a correct understanding of the meaning of the category "material" in historical materialism. He believes that "social existence," "material living relations," and "material living conditions of society" cannot be understood merely as social productive forces and relations of production. He said: "When historical materialists make material observations and analyses of ideas and history, they should and must consider all relevant social material relations, and should not and cannot be limited to productive forces and relations of production, although it is always the main link compared with other social material living conditions (especially after the disintegration of primitive society)." Therefore, "the production of social material means of subsistence cannot be mistaken for being another name for social material living conditions, because it is only the most important component of the latter."

He said that as for the production of human beings themselves, the propagation of the race, of course, is not the production of material means of subsistence. People are the basic productive force of society, so Stalin said: "The growth of population certainly affects the development of society, promoting or delaying social development." This influence exists in any society, and it is more pronounced in primitive society because production tools were very backward at that time. As for Stalin saying that population cannot be the main force determining the nature and appearance of the social system, this is certainly correct, but this does not contradict Engels's argument. Because Stalin's words make a general analysis of the development of human society, while Engels intends to further explain the following issues through his work: In this stage of human primitive society, how did social systems (mainly the clan system) develop and change? How did the private slave society, the monogamous family, and the state standing at the head of society emerge from primitive society?

Luo Gengmo believes that in the primitive social stage, the clan organizational unit is also the social economic organizational unit, and the two are inseparable. The emergence of the clan system is of course determined by the development and changes of productive forces and relations of production, but it is also governed by the objective laws of the production of human beings themselves. This is clearly demonstrated in the second chapter of Engels's book. Luo Gengmo said: "Objectively, if several material factors play a role, then several material factors play a role. We cannot artificially increase them, nor can we artificially reduce them." Engels, based on an analysis of the social material living conditions (social existence) at the time, proved that the material factor of human production itself has a special effect. "Only Engels could dialectically and comprehensively proceed from the historical facts themselves, unearth the main natural selection factor of blood ties, and make a complete scientific explanation." Luo Gengmo believes that this does not violate the principles of historical materialism in the slightest, and has nothing in common with dualism; on the contrary, this formula, which specifically refers to the clan system of primitive society, is not only correct for historical materialism, but also an indispensable supplement.

### 关于唯物史观的一个著名公式的探讨

　　关于唯物史观的一个著名公式的探讨
    恩格斯在其“家庭、私有制和国家的起源”一书的序言中提出过一个唯物史观的著名公式，即人类种族蕃衍和生活资料生产同样是决定社会及社会制度发展的原因。理论界一些人认为恩格斯的这个公式是“不确切的”、“不精确的”，甚至是“拿二元论的观点来代替一元论的观点”，“破坏了一元论历史观”等等。但也有人认为对恩格斯这个公式的这种论断是不对的。最近，骆耕漠在“哲学研究”第五期上，以“关于唯物史观的一个经典公式的研究”为题发表了文章，对这个原理作了探讨。
    骆耕漠认为要理解这个公式的正确性，首先应该对唯物史观的“唯物”这一范畴的含义有正确的理解。他认为不能把“社会存在”、“物质生活关系”、“社会物质生活条件”，仅仅理解为社会生产力和生产关系。他说：“历史唯物主义者对思想、对历史作唯物的观察和分析时，原来是应该和必须考虑到各种有关的社会物质关系，原来不应该和不能以生产力和生产关系为限，虽然它同其他社会物质生活条件相比，始终是主要的一环（特别是在原始社会解体以后）”。所以“社会物质生活资料的生产，不能被误认为就是社会物质生活条件的别称，因为它只是后者的一个最重要的构成部分”而已。
    他说，至于人类自身的生产、种族的蕃衍，当然也不是物质生活资料的生产。人是社会的基本生产力，所以斯大林说：“人口的增长当然影响到社会的发展，促进或延缓社会底发展”。这种影响是对任何社会都存在的，它对原始社会则表现得更强烈一些，因为那时生产工具非常落后。至于斯大林说，人口不能是决定社会制度性质和社会面貌的主要力量，这当然是正确的，但是这和恩格斯的论点并不矛盾。因为斯大林这话是对人类社会的发展作总的概括的分析，而恩格斯是要通过他的著作进而专门说明下列问题：在人类原始社会这个阶段内，社会制度（主要即为氏族制度）如何发展变化？后来私有的奴隶制社会、一夫一妻制的家庭和站在社会头上的国家，如何从原始社会脱胎出来？
    骆耕漠认为，在原始社会阶段，氏族组织单位同时也就是社会经济组织单位，两者是分不开的。氏族制度的出现，当然也是受生产力和生产关系发展变化决定的，但是同时又受人类本身的生产的客观规律所支配。这在恩格斯此书的第二章论证得很清楚。骆耕漠说：“客观上有几个物质因素起作用，就是几个物质因素起作用，我们既不能人为地增加，也不能人为地减少”。恩格斯是根据对当时的社会物质生活条件（社会存在）的分析，证明其中人类自身的生产这一物质因素有特殊作用。“也只有恩格斯才能那样辩证地、全面地从历史事实本身出发，把那主要的血统的自然选择因素发掘出来，并作出完整的科学的说明”。骆耕漠认为，这一点也没有违背历史唯物主义的原理，和二元论也毫无共同之点；恰好相反，这个专指原始社会氏族制度而言的公式，对于唯物史观来说，不但是正确的，而且是不可少的补充。
