The Union of South Africa, although remotely located at the southernmost tip of the African continent, has become a place that has shocked the world for many years due to its appalling racial oppression. The Union of South Africa has in fact become a "hell on earth" where Africans are ravaged.

The Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, Strijdom, once publicly declared: "White people are the masters of South Africa." The reactionary Strijdom ruling clique, through a series of fascist laws and various racial discrimination measures, tramples on the Africans and other colored people who account for four-fifths of the population.

As early as more than one hundred and fifty years ago, when the indigenous residents of South Africa first came into contact with Europeans, they were subjected to oppression by European whites. After the establishment of the white regime in South Africa in 1948, the situation of Africans became even more unbearable. Most of the bills passed by the Union of South Africa in the past eight years have been aimed at further strengthening the oppression and humiliation of Africans and colored people, and persecuting progressive Europeans who oppose racial discrimination.

In the Union of South Africa, Africans and other colored people are deprived of social and political rights. They do not have the right to be elected to the House of Assembly, the Senate, and the municipal government organs of states and cities. In the 159 seats in the House of Assembly, 9 million Africans can only elect three representatives, and in the Senate they can only elect four representatives, and these representatives must be Europeans, and the candidates are pre-designated by the government.

The vast indigenous population of the Union of South Africa cannot study culture. The children of Africans do not even have the right to attend primary and secondary schools with European children. The vast majority of local people are not allowed to enter the school gates at all. The "Bantu Education Act," which came into effect on January 1, 1954, only allows the children of some white servants to enter schools.

The reactionary Strijdom government also prohibits Africans from watching plays, movies, staying in hotels, and entering restaurants and cafes. Not to mention taking trains and buses, even sitting on benches for pedestrians to rest in the street and visiting public places are "clearly divided between black and white," and cannot cross the line. White immigrants also guard against Africans as "thieves." Huge billboards can be seen everywhere on the road, with the words: "Beware of Natives!" Every African must always carry five or six kinds of documents under the name of "pass," otherwise they will have to go to jail for a slight mistake. Africans are prohibited from moving into urban areas. They can only live in special residential areas outside the city. It is a poor, dirty, and crude shanty. In addition, in order to facilitate the exploitation and suppression of bone marrow, the reactionary government can drive the indigenous residents around like livestock. The 1950 "Specific Residential Areas Act" legalized this reactionary measure. The 1953 "Native Labor Legislation" openly prohibits African workers from having the right to protest to their employers. As for strikes and progressive activities, restrictions are even stricter. The 1952 "Suppression of Communism Ordinance" wantonly persecutes communists, activists in the trade union movement, and progressives. A fascist bill that came into effect on January 1, 1957, stipulates that whites and blacks have no right to join the same trade union, giving the Minister of Labor unlimited power to deprive Africans of their jobs.

The ruling group of the Union of South Africa also uses various means to economically enslave and extract the blood and sweat of Africans. The exploitation of Africans is extremely serious.

From the perspective of socio-economic structure, the characteristics of the South African economy are the intertwining of feudalism, colonialism, and modern capitalism. In terms of agriculture, it has a strong feudal color. With the exception of a very small number of capitalist farms, the vast majority are European farms operated in a primitive manner. The approximately one million African agricultural workers they employ are in a state of semi-slavery. The actual wages of these agricultural workers average 25 pounds a year, which is difficult to make a living. Their wives and children must also serve as servants for the whites, without any remuneration. They are often subjected to whipping and detention for some resistance and loafing. In recent years, incidents of agricultural workers being beaten to death have continued to occur. White farmers are unwilling to adopt modern technologies such as tractors and harvesters in order to seize huge profits, and regard the cheap labor of Africans as cattle and horses to drive.

The characteristics of colonialism are mainly reflected in the mining industry. Although the land in South Africa is barren, the minerals buried underground are world-renowned. Especially uranium, an important modern strategic material, is produced in abundance. South Africa produces a high output of gold and diamonds. Up to now, the total value of South Africa's mineral products has exceeded 4 billion pounds. However, South Africa's mines have been in the hands of foreigners from the very beginning. Most of the investment comes from British monopoly capital, and American and French capitalists have also invested some capital. For more than sixty years, South Africa's mining industry has overwhelmed other economic sectors and has a huge impact on South Africa's economic and political life. And most of the blood and sweat of South Africa's Africans is also mainly extracted by the colonists in this regard. The inhuman treatment suffered by South Africa's 400,000 African miners is unspeakable. Their eight-hour wage is only about two shillings and eight pence, which is less than one-twentieth of that of European miners. They have no dormitories and no decent workshops. They live in damp cement cellars, which are also fenced with barbed wire. They are not allowed to go out without special permission. It is even forbidden to bring family members.

Not only miners, but also the more than 500,000 African workers working in the modern processing industry are not much better. Because, although wages can be higher, racial discrimination and poverty still accompany them like shadows.

Due to South Africa's production of uranium and its important strategic location, American imperialism has been expanding into South Africa for more than ten years after the war. It regards South Africa as an important base for expanding to the entire African continent, in order to accelerate the expulsion of the old colonialist forces of Britain and France and enslave and exploit the people of the African continent. American private investment in South Africa has exceeded 300 million US dollars, which is more than all the investment in the rest of Africa combined. The American belligerent ruling group is trying its best to monopolize the export of South African uranium and other strategic materials. Since the Second World War, the Union of South Africa has consistently been the main market for the United States in Africa. There are more than 100 American companies doing business in South Africa alone. This penetration and expansion of the United States in South Africa has intensified the contradictions between new and old colonialism, and at the same time has made South Africa's Africans fall into the abyss of poverty, humiliation, and racial oppression.

The Africans of the Union of South Africa, who have no power or influence in politics and are subjected to cruel exploitation in the economy, are waging fierce struggles to fight for basic human rights and get rid of racial oppression. At present, many Europeans who have eliminated racial prejudice sympathize with and support their struggle. The world's just public opinion is constantly condemning the bloody racial oppression in the Union of South Africa. At this Asian-African Solidarity Conference, the Sudanese representative's report on racial discrimination suggested that the conference pass a resolution condemning the policy of racial discrimination. This just call will undoubtedly greatly encourage the struggle of the Africans in South Africa. The Africans of South Africa and other colored people who suffer from racial oppression will sooner or later break free from this yoke!

    南非联邦是非洲人的大监牢
    罗葆齐
    南非联邦虽然僻处非洲大陆的最南端，但那里的骇人听闻的种族压迫却使它许多年来成为轰动世界的地方。南非联邦实际上已成为残害非洲人的“人间地狱”。
    南非联邦总理斯揣敦曾经公开地扬言：“白种人是南非的主人”。反动的斯揣敦统治集团，通过一系列的法西斯法案和各色各样的种族歧视措施，把占人口五分之四的非洲人及其他有色人种踩在脚底下。
    远在一百五十多年以前，当南非土著居民刚刚接触到欧洲人的时候起，他们就遭到了欧洲白种人的压迫。到1948年南非白种人的政权建立以后，非洲人的处境就更加不堪忍受。最近八年来，南非联邦所通过的大多数法案，都是为了进一步加强对非洲人和有色人的压迫和凌辱，并迫害反对种族歧视的进步的欧洲人。
    在南非联邦，非洲人及其他有色人种，被剥夺了社会政治权利。他们没有被选入众议院、参议院和州市政权机关的权利。在众议院的一百五十九个议席中，九百万的非洲人只能选举三个代表，在参议院只能选举四个代表，而且这些代表都必须是欧洲人，并且候选人是由政府预先指定的。
    南非联邦的广大土著居民不能学习文化。非洲人的子弟连和欧洲人的孩子一块进中小学校的权利都没有。绝大多数的当地人，连学校的大门都不准入。1954年1月1日生效的“班图族教育法”，也只能允许某些白人的仆役的子女进学校。
    斯揣敦反动政府还禁止非洲人看戏、看电影、住旅馆、进饭馆和咖啡店。乘火车和公共汽车不用说，即使是坐街心供行人休息的凳子和游览公共场所，也是“黑白分明”，不能越雷池一步。白种移民还把非洲人当“偷儿”来防范，在马路上到处可以见到巨大的告示牌，上面写着：“当心土人！”每一个非洲人身上要经常带着“通行证”一类名目的五、六种证件，否则稍有失误，就得蹲班房。非洲人被禁止迁入城市区。他们只能在城市以外的特种居住区里生活。那里是一片贫穷、肮脏、简陋不堪的茅舍。此外，为了便于敲骨吸髓的剥削和镇压，反动政府可以把土著居民当作牲口一样赶来赶去。1950年的“特定住区法”使这种反动措施合法化。1953年的“土著劳动立法”更公然禁止非洲籍工人有向雇主提出抗议的权利。至于罢工和从事进步活动，就限制得更严。1952年的“镇压共产主义条例”，肆意迫害共产党人、工会运动的积极分子和进步人士。1957年1月1日生效的一个法西斯法案，规定白人和黑人无权加入同一个工会，赋予劳动部长剥夺非洲人工作的无限权力。
    南非联邦的统治集团而且用各种手段来从经济上奴役和榨取非洲人的血汗。非洲人所受的剥削，是异常严重的。
    从社会经济结构来看，南非经济的特点是封建主义、殖民主义和现代资本主义的因素交织在一起。就农业来说，是封建主义色彩较浓。除极少数资本主义农场外，绝大多数是采用原始方式经营的欧洲人农场。他们雇佣的大约一百万名非洲籍农业工人，处于半奴隶状态。这些农业工人的实际工资平均一年为二十五镑，难以糊口。他们的妻子、儿女还必须给白人充当奴仆，分文的报酬也没有。他们稍有一些反抗和怠工，动辄遭受鞭笞、拘押。近年来各处农业工人被打死的事件不断发生。白人农场主为了攫取大量利润而不愿采用拖拉机、收割机等现代技术，把非洲人的廉价劳动力当作牛马来驱使。
    殖民主义的特点，则主要表现在采矿工业。南非的土地虽然贫瘠，但是地下埋藏的矿物却是世界闻名的。尤其是现代重要战略物资的铀，产量极丰。南非出产的黄金、钻石，产量很高。到现在为止，南非的矿产总值已超过四十亿镑。但是南非的矿场从一开始起，就掌握在外国人手里。大部分的投资来自英国垄断资本，美国和法国的资本家也投进了一些资本。南非的采矿业到目前为止的六十多年间，一直压倒其它经济部门，对南非的经济和政治生活有巨大的影响。而南非的非洲人的大部分血汗，也主要是在这个方面被殖民者所榨取。南非的四十万非洲籍矿工，所受的非人待遇是苦不堪言的。他们八小时的工资只有二先令八便士左右，还不及欧洲籍矿工的二十分之一。他们没有什么宿舍，也没有像样的工房子，他们住在潮湿的水泥地窖里，外面还用铁丝网拦起来，不经特别许可，不得外出。更不准携带家口。
    不仅是矿工，就是在现代化的加工工业部门作工的五十多万非洲籍工人，也好不了多少。因为，工资虽然可以多拿一些，但是种族歧视和贫困仍然像影子一样伴随着他们。
    由于南非出产铀矿和在战略上占居重要位置，美帝国主义在战后十几年当中就一直向南非扩张。它把南非当作向整个非洲大陆扩张的一个重要据点，以加速排挤英法旧殖民主义势力和奴役、剥削非洲大陆的人民。美国在南非的私人投资已超过三亿美元，比在非洲其余地区投资合在一起还要多。美国好战的统治集团，竭力垄断南非铀及其它战略物资的出口。自二次大战以后，南非联邦一贯是美国在非洲的主要市场。光是在南非作生意的美国公司，就有一百多个。美国在南非的这种渗透和扩张加剧了新旧殖民主义之间的矛盾，同时更使南非的非洲人陷入贫困、屈辱和种族压迫的深渊。
    在政治上无权无势、在经济上遭受残酷剥削的南非联邦的非洲人，为争取起码的人权和摆脱种族压迫，正在进行激烈的斗争。目前已有不少解除种族偏见的欧洲人，同情和支持他们的斗争。世界上的正义舆论，更不断谴责南非联邦的血腥的种族压迫。在这次亚非团结大会上，苏丹代表所作的关于种族歧视的报告，建议大会通过决议，谴责种族歧视政策。这种正义的呼声无疑将大大鼓舞南非的非洲人的斗争。南非的非洲人和其他遭受种族压迫的有色人种，迟早是会挣脱这个枷锁的！
