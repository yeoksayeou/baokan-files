The War Situation in Algeria
　　Yan Jin
　　The Algerian people's armed uprising began on November 1, 1954, and has lasted for more than three years. In these three years, the war situation in Algeria has undergone great changes.

　　The Transfer of the Initiative in the War
　　The French colonial authorities have constantly published war reports to boast of their "victories," and have more than once declared that the "pacification" of Algeria is about to end. If this were indeed the case, it would be difficult to explain why the French army in Algeria has increased from 50,000 at the beginning to the current 560,000, and why France's military expenditure for the war in Algeria has increased to more than 1 billion francs per day and is still not enough.
　　In fact, France's situation in the Algerian war is becoming increasingly passive.
　　The military situation has developed in this way over the past three years (see map): At the end of 1954, the armed struggle initially unfolded in the Aures region of eastern Algeria and the Tizi Ouzou region on the northern Mediterranean coast. At that time, the fighting was still localized. By the second half of 1956, the eastern combat area had greatly expanded, extending eastward to the Tunisian border and northward to the Mediterranean coast. The northern Tizi Ouzou combat area also expanded to include the capital, Algiers. In addition, the western Moroccan border combat area, which had already been opened in January 1956, also expanded eastward and northward to include Oran. At the same time, a new combat area centered on Orléansville appeared in the middle and west of the region. The fighting in these areas formed a mutually supportive situation, and gradually developed towards all-out war. At this time, the French colonial army was already exhausted, and had to put on a show of strength to cover up their defeats. They also constantly sent reinforcements and used the most despicable means to kidnap the five Algerian leaders headed by Ben Bella, who were responsible for negotiating with the French authorities, in an attempt to undermine the Algerian people's will to fight. But these methods all failed. In March and April of this year, fighting broke out throughout Algeria, from the north of the Sahara Desert to the southern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, and the colonialists felt even more overwhelmed.
　　There are several noteworthy points in the military situation from March and April of this year to the present. First, the anti-colonialist fighting has recently developed southward towards the Sahara Desert region. Second, the fighting in the original northern Algerian regions is also being further strengthened, especially in the Aures, Constantine, and Oran regions. According to materials released by the Algerian National Liberation Army, in June of this year, the number of French troops killed or wounded in the above-mentioned war zones was at least several thousand. In the second half of July alone, the French army suffered more than 400 soldiers and 5 officers killed or wounded. In the fourteen days of fighting from August 11 to 25, more than 2,000 French soldiers were killed and more than 1,400 were wounded. The severity of the losses was unprecedented. Third, at the end of October, the National Liberation Army launched a nationwide military offensive to commemorate the third anniversary of the uprising, and has already achieved initial gains.
　　In general, the development of the Algerian people's armed struggle over the past three years has been from points to areas, from rural areas to towns, from the center to the border, and from the coastline to the great desert. At present, control of the entire battlefield has gradually shifted into the hands of the Algerian national warriors.

　　The Growth of the Algerian Fighting Forces
　　In the three years of fighting, the Algerian National Liberation Army has been growing rapidly. This force has developed from a scattered group of several thousand insurgents into an army of 120,000 to 150,000 men with unified command. Not long ago, the National Liberation Army divided the country into seven war zones. Larger war zones are divided into several military regions, and military regions and smaller war zones are further divided into several military sub-districts. Under each military sub-district, several battalions, companies, and platoons are established as combat units. It is said that the National Liberation Army has recently adjusted its military command system, merging the main battlefields, that is, the areas north of the Sahara Desert, with Constantine, Algiers, and Oran as the centers, into three major war zones in the east, center, and west, in order to facilitate more concentrated and flexible command of operations.
　　Now, even some Western bourgeois figures admit that the Algerian National Liberation Army is a "new type of army with discipline, strength, a unified command, and strategy, and also possesses the foundations of a new type of state..." When the armed struggle first broke out, the insurgents had only some dilapidated rifles and grenades. Now, according to a report by Lee McCardell, a reporter for the American "Baltimore Sun," the National Liberation Army has new-style rifles, mortars, rocket launchers, light and heavy machine guns, and automatic weapons, and has sufficient ammunition reserves. In order to cover up their defeats, the French colonialists have repeatedly complained that some foreign countries are supplying Algeria with arms, but even reports from Western journalists admit that the National Liberation Army's armaments are mostly captured from the French army. On the contrary, the French colonial army has used a large number of new-style weapons supplied by the United States through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
　　Although Algeria already has a strong army and a considerable amount of military equipment, the National Liberation Army is still at a disadvantage in terms of quantity and equipment today, so it basically adopts effective guerrilla tactics to fight the French army. The French colonialists dispatched a large number of aircraft, artillery, tanks, and even used poison gas bombs and shrapnel to attack the Algerian national warriors. In the large-scale offensive launched by the French army in August of this year, more than 2,000 sorties of aircraft were dispatched, and naval vessels also participated in the offensive. But none of these were able to destroy the National Liberation Army. The National Liberation Army mobilely adopted the methods of dividing the whole into parts and integrating the parts into the whole in the face of the superior enemy, so that they could not find targets when attacking, and were beaten everywhere when defending.

　　The Algerian People's Urgent Desire
　　The Algerian National Liberation Army is led by the National Liberation Front. The Algerian National Liberation Front has always been supported by the broad masses of the Algerian people. On September 5 of this year, the National Liberation Front issued a communique in Cairo stating that, due to the needs of the armed struggle, the Algerian Revolutionary National Council (the leading body of the Front) had been expanded from the original thirty-four members to fifty-four members; the central executive organ of this committee, the "Liaison and Implementation Committee," had also been expanded from five executive members to nine executive members, and the five leaders who were kidnapped last year were named honorary members. Of the nine members of the "Liaison and Implementation Committee," seven were originally members of the "Party for the Victory of Democratic Freedoms," and two were members of the "Democratic Union for the Algerian Manifesto." This shows that the unity of the Algerian people's forces in the struggle for national independence has been further strengthened.
　　The Algerian Communist Party issued a statement in January of this year, supporting the National Liberation Front's anti-imperialist actions and the provisions in the Front's program regarding a ceasefire based on independence, the establishment of a democratic socialist republic, and the in-depth implementation of land reform. Algerian Communist Party members actively participated in the liberation war and fought heroically for national independence.
　　The Algerian Communist Party supports the National Liberation Front's proposal to hold peace talks with France on the basis of France's recognition of the Algerian nation's right to independence. For the Algerian people, national independence and peace are inseparable. This kind of peace must be premised on the recognition of Algeria's right to national independence. Although the French colonialists have put forward the proposal of a "ceasefire," this "ceasefire" is essentially to ask Algeria to hand over its weapons and abandon the demand for national independence, which is of course absolutely unacceptable to the Algerian people. In order to win genuine national independence, the Algerian people not only fight against the vicious French colonialists, but also oppose the hypocritical and extremely insidious "Eisenhower Doctrine." The Algerian people will never "drive away the wolf through the front door and let the tiger in through the back door." They are waging a bloody struggle to win genuine independence and a just peace, not a fake independence and a peace under colonial rule.
　　What is worth considering is the French side. Continuing to act recklessly in Algeria will not only fail to reverse the defeat, but will also create an opportunity for the United States to further squeeze out France. Only by recognizing Algeria's independence as soon as possible and conducting equal and mutually beneficial negotiations with Algeria on this basis can there be a way out that conforms to the French national interest.

　　阿尔及利亚的战争形势
　　言金
    阿尔及利亚人民的武装起义从1954年11月1日开始，到现在已经三年多了。在这三年中，阿尔及利亚的战争形势起了很大的变化。
              战争主动权的转移
    法国殖民当局曾经不断地发表战报来吹嘘他们的“胜利”，还不止一次地扬言对阿尔及利亚的“绥靖”即将结束。如果情况确实如此，那么就很难解释为什么法国在阿尔及利亚的军队要从开始时的五万人增加到目前的五六十万人，为什么法国对阿尔及利亚作战的军费增加到了每天十几亿法郎还不够。
    事实上，法国在阿尔及利亚战争中的处境是越来越被动了。
    三年来的军事形势是这样发展的（参看地图）：1954年底，武装斗争最初在阿尔及利亚东部的奥雷斯地区和北部地中海海岸的迪西乌祖地区展开，当时的战斗还是局部性的。到了1956年下半年，东部战斗地区已经大大扩展，不但向东伸展到突尼斯边境，而且向北伸展到地中海海岸，北部迪西乌祖方面的战斗地区也扩展到包括首都阿尔及尔在内。此外，从1956年1月就已经开辟的西部摩洛哥边境的战斗地区，也向东向北扩展到包括阿兰在内，同时以奥尔良城为中心的新战斗地区又在中、西两地区中间出现。这几个地区的战斗形成了猗角相依之势，而逐渐向全面发展。这时，法国殖民军队已经疲于奔命，只好虚张声势以掩饰败绩，同时不断增援，并且用最卑鄙的手段绑架以本·贝拉为首的五名负责同法国当局谈判的阿尔及利亚领袖，企图瓦解阿尔及利亚人民的战斗意志。但是这些办法都失败了。今年3、4月间，阿尔及利亚从撒哈拉沙漠以北直到地中海南岸的整个地区都发生了战斗，殖民主义者更加感到穷于应付了。
    今年3、4月后到现在的军事形势有几点是值得注意的。第一，反殖民主义的战斗最近已经往南向撒哈拉沙漠地区发展。第二，原来的阿尔及利亚北部各个地区的战斗也在进一步加强，尤其是奥雷斯、君士坦丁、阿兰等地区的战斗更加激烈。据阿尔及利亚民族解放军公布的材料，今年6月间，在上述几个战区内伤亡的法军人数至少有数千人，仅7月下半月，法军就伤亡四百多名士兵和五名军官，从8月11日到25日这十四天的战斗中，法军就被击毙了二千多人、击伤一千四百多人。损失之重是过去所没有过的。第三，10月底，民族解放军为着纪念起义三周年，发动了一次全国范围的军事攻击行动，并已有了初步的收获。
    总的来说，三年来阿尔及利亚人民武装斗争的开展，是由点到面，由乡村到城镇，由中心到边境，由海岸线到大沙漠。目前，整个战场的控制权已逐渐转移到阿尔及利亚民族战士的手中。
          阿尔及利亚战斗部队的成长
    在三年的战斗中，阿尔及利亚民族解放军在迅速地成长着。这支部队由分散的几千名起义人员发展为一支有统一指挥的、拥有十二万至十五万人的军队。不久以前民族解放军曾把全国划分为七个战区。较大的战区分为若干军区，军区和较小的战区又分为若干军分区，各军分区之下成立若干营、连和排等战斗单位。据说最近民族解放军又调整其军事指挥系统，把主要的战场，即撒哈拉沙漠以北的地区以君士坦丁、阿尔及尔和阿兰三处为中心归并为东、中、西三个大战区，以便于更加集中地和灵活地指挥作战。
    现在，连西方的一些资产阶级人士都承认，阿尔及利亚民族解放军是一支“有纪律、有实力、有统一的司令部和战略的新型军队，而且也具备了新型国家的基础……”。武装斗争初爆发时，起义者手中只有一些破烂的步枪和手榴弹，现在据美国“巴尔的摩太阳报”记者李·麦卡德的报道，民族解放军已拥有新式的步枪、迫击炮、火箭炮、轻重机枪和自动武器，并且拥有充分的弹药储备。法国殖民主义者为了掩饰自己的败绩，一再抱怨有什么外国供给阿尔及利亚以军火，但连西方国家记者的报道也承认，民族解放军的军备，极大部分是从法国军队那里缴获的。反之，法国殖民军倒是使用了大批由美国通过北大西洋公约供应的新式武器。
    阿尔及利亚虽然已经有了一支坚强的军队和相当多的军备，但民族解放军今天在数量和装备上还处于劣势，因此基本上还是采取有效的游击战术来同法军作战。法国殖民主义者出动大量飞机、大炮、坦克，甚至用毒气弹、榴霰弹等来进攻阿尔及利亚的民族战士。在今年8月法国军队发动的大规模攻势中，飞机出动了两千多架次，海军舰艇也参加进攻。但这些都没有能够摧毁民族解放军。民族解放军在优势的敌人面前机动地采取化整为零和化零为整的办法来对付法军，使他们在进攻时找不到目标，在防御时则到处挨打。
          阿尔及利亚人民的迫切愿望
    阿尔及利亚的民族解放军是由民族解放阵线领导的。阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线一直得到阿尔及利亚广大人民的拥护和支持。今年9月5日，民族解放阵线在开罗发表公报说：由于武装斗争的需要，阿尔及利亚革命民族委员会（该阵线的领导机构）由原来的三十四名委员扩充到五十四名委员；这个委员会的中央执行机关“联络和执行委员会”，也从五名执行委员扩充到九名执行委员，并以去年被绑架的五名领袖为名誉委员。在“联络和执行委员会”的九名委员中，七名原是“争取民主自由胜利党”的党员，两名是“拥护阿尔及利亚宣言民主联盟”的盟员。这表明阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的力量的团结又进一步加强了。
    阿尔及利亚共产党在今年1月间曾发表一项声明，支持民族解放阵线的反帝行动和该阵线的纲领中关于在独立的基础上停火、成立民主社会共和国、深入地进行土地改革等规定。阿尔及利亚共产党党员积极参加解放战争，为争取民族独立而英勇战斗。
    阿尔及利亚共产党支持民族解放阵线关于在法国承认阿尔及利亚民族独立权利的基础上同法国进行和平谈判的主张。对阿尔及利亚人民说来，民族独立与和平这两者是不可分的。这种和平必须以承认阿尔及利亚的民族独立权利为前提。法国殖民主义者虽然提出了“停火”的主张，但是，这种“停火”实质上是要阿尔及利亚交出武器并且放弃民族独立的要求，这当然是阿尔及利亚人民所绝对不能同意的。为了争取真正的民族独立，阿尔及利亚人民不仅同凶恶的法国殖民主义作斗争，而且反对伪善的、极端阴险的“艾森豪威尔主义”。阿尔及利亚人民绝不会“前门拒狼，后门引虎”。他们进行流血的斗争，是为了争取真正的独立和正义的和平，而不是一个假的独立和殖民统治下的和平。
    值得考虑的倒是法国方面，在阿尔及利亚蛮干下去非但不能挽回败局，反而会给美国创造进一步排挤法国的可乘之机。只有及早承认阿尔及利亚独立，并以此为基础同阿尔及利亚进行平等互利的谈判，才是一条符合法国民族利益的出路。（附图片）
