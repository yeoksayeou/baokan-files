    I Saw "Rickshaw Boy"
    ——A Letter to the Beijing People's Art Theatre
    Rickshaw Worker Du Jingduo
    Dear Comrades: You've worked hard. I saw your performance on the 17th, and it was very good. Dear comrades, I don't understand stage art. This is the first time in my life I've seen a stage play. I really don't know what language to use to describe the content of the play. I can only say that the content includes birth, old age, sickness, death, suffering, joy, happiness, sadness, and misery!
    Dear comrades, you were able to vividly portray the tragic lives of people like us in the dark society for the vast audience. I cannot deny that this is the highest art, and it can only be achieved under the leadership of the great Communist Party.
    Dear comrades, this performance had a great impact. In previous performances, I didn't see any particular group of audience members being more numerous, but this time the majority of the audience was people like us, especially old colleagues, and there were quite a few of them, which reflects very well.
    Dear comrades, I cannot say that I have experienced all the content of the play. I have never experienced Er Qiangzi selling his daughter, but I have seen it with my own eyes, and more than once. Dear comrades, Tiger Girl's shrewish energy is impressive, especially the red scarf (wide muffler) is just right. The pair of shoes she wears with pompons, if they were knitted from wool, would be perfect. I didn't see what they were made of. Her love for Xiangzi is portrayed very well, truly capturing the "hitting hurts, scolding is love, kicking when anxious" kind of shrewish love. But Little Fuzi's love for Xiangzi and Tiger Girl is kind, pure, and innocent. These two female roles are played very well. When Tiger Girl sees Little Shunzi returning from pulling a rickshaw and hears that he earned more than eight mao, she asks him for the rickshaw fee he owed from the previous day. She should say, "We are beggars eating with silver bowls, not asking you for small change." Little Shunzi comes in and warms his feet by the stove, eating pancakes while talking, which is very consistent with daily life. Er Qiangzi's performance is good, and Old Ma's clothing is very appropriate, especially his gestures while chatting with everyone are excellent. Whether it's Tie Dan or Little Liu calling Old Ma "Grandpa," it's not right. They should call him "Lords," which would be more like the local slang at the time. The big guy, from the head covering to the shoes, is ideal. But his action of going out to pull a rickshaw on a snowy day is very accurate. He says, "Adults can endure hunger, but my five little monkeys won't agree if they don't eat," which is not right. He should say "five demanding devils" or "five mixed flour sacks" would be more appropriate. "Monkeys" is a term of abuse used by eunuchs in the imperial palace, not something ordinary people would say. If he added "scratching and picking lice," it would be even better. Patches on clothing are a good representation. He should add two complaints, saying: "The rickshaw owner only cares about money, not the condition of the rickshaw; it's going to break down one of these days. Alas, there's nothing to be done." The street vendors' calls are very melodic, especially appropriate for the season. When Xiangzi buys stuffed buns for Old Ma, it would be appropriate if he bought them from a shop near the rickshaw station; it would not be right if he bought them from a street vendor, because at that time, all kinds of buns were sold on the street, except for stuffed buns. Little Shunzi doesn't let the big guy go out to pull a rickshaw. He gives all of his six mao to the big guy, and at the same time influences Er Qiangzi to also give the big guy money. This scene is very well done. The indoor furnishings are very appropriate, such as the coin jar, hanging lamp, bench, and phonograph, but Liu Si's briefcase is not right. He should use a lacquered elm wood silver cabinet, with silver dollars and banknotes on top, and copper coins below. Liu Si's birdcage should not have a white jade bird, but rather a large thrush cage, swinging back and forth when he walks, to properly reflect his gangster style. This time, his clothing is appropriate from top to bottom. He speaks very well, especially when he says he wants his partners to contribute, and that ten dollars isn't too little – that's great.
    The detective Sun San has a bit of the look. Others don't look like it. Especially the Western suit, leather shoes, American hat, and parted hair. This kind of attire is what Kuomintang and Japanese devils' special agents wore. At that time, most detectives had to wear flat-topped hats, wear a large robe with a mandarin jacket or vest, the robe should be widely slit, with long, wide sleeves that could hide the hands. When walking, they would lift the slit with their left hand, pulling their arms diagonally and shaking their heads, which would be enough to capture the "tough" look of these people. Of course, they had to disguise themselves when handling cases, so they should wear short clothes and be less conspicuous. When they go to Mr. Cao's house, going over the roof first and then knocking on the door is correct. Dear comrades, those who play these people from the dark side must express ruthlessness, cruelty, and maliciousness, along with cunning and wickedness, to be convincing.
    Dear comrades, I love you from the bottom of my heart. I ask to be your revolutionary comrade-in-arms. If you have any time, please let me know, and I will come to see you. Goodbye.

    我看了“骆驼祥子”
    ——给北京人民艺术剧院的一封信
    三轮车工人　杜晶铎
    亲爱的同志：您们辛苦了。17日您们的演出我看了，很好。亲爱的同志们，我是不懂舞台艺术，我自生以来还是头回看话剧，我真不知用什么样语言来说出剧的内容，我只能说内容包括了生老病死苦，喜乐悲哀惨呀！
    亲爱的同志们，您们能够把黑暗社会里的我们这一行人悲惨的生活，活生生地演给广大观众看，我不能否认这是最高的艺术，只有在伟大的共产党领导下才能够做得到。
    亲爱的同志们，这次演出效果很大，以前的演出，我没看见观众哪一行人比较多，这次的观众大多数是我们这行人，尤其是老同行，也不在少数，反映很好。
    亲爱的同志们，剧的内容我不能说全都受过，只有二强子卖女儿没受过，可是我亲眼看过，还不只一次。亲爱的同志们，虎妞的泼辣劲够意思，尤其是红披巾（宽围脖）很对。她穿的那双带绒球的鞋，要是毛线打的，就对了，我没看真是什么的。她对祥子的爱，演的很好，真作到了是“打着疼、骂着爱、急了拿脚踹”的泼辣爱。可是小福子对于祥子和虎妞是善良的、纯洁的、天真的爱。这两位女角演的很好。虎妞见小顺子拉车回来，听说他拉来八毛多钱，她就要他头天欠的车份，她应该说：“我们爷们是拿银碗讨饭吃，不是跟您要小钱了。”小顺子进门就烤脚，拿着烙饼连吃带说，很够生活规律。二强子演的好，老马穿带够样，尤其是同大家聊天的动作非常好。是铁旦，还是小六，叫老马一声“老大爷”，不对，应该叫“老爷们”，就像当时的土语了。大个子由头上包的至脚下穿的，够理想。可是在大风雪的天他要出车，这个动作很对。他说：“大人没吃忍得住，我那五个猴崽子没吃不答应”，不对。他应该说“五个要命鬼”或说“五个杂合面口袋”就对了。猴崽子是皇宫里的太监骂人的话，不是普通人说的话。他如果再加上“挠痒痒，带拿虱子”可就更好了。补破里带是很好的表现，应该加上两句怨言，说：“车主就知道要钱不要货，哪天都得放泡，唉，没法。”大街过来的小贩吆唤的韵调很好，尤其合乎季节。祥子给老马买攢馅包子，如果是在车厂左近铺子里买的，就对了；要是在小贩手里买的，就不对，那时候什么包子都有下街卖的，就是没有卖攅馅的。小顺子不叫大个子出车，他将所有的六毛多钱都给了大个子，同时影响了二强子，也给大个子钱，这一场面作的非常好。屋内的摆设很对，如钱筒子、吊灯、板凳、话匣子，就是刘四的手提保险箱不对。应该用榆木擦漆的银柜，上面放现洋毛钱和票子，下面放铜子。刘四的鸟笼子不要白玉鸟，来个大画眉笼子，走路时摇摇晃晃才够他的混混派（地痞流氓）。他这回的服装由上至下够样，他说话很好，尤其他说要伙伴们给他出份子，十大枚不嫌少，太好了。
    侦缉队孙三还有点样。其他就不像了。尤其是西服装、皮鞋、美国帽、分头，像这个样打扮是国民党和日本鬼用的特务的打扮。按那时候，侦缉队大多数须戴平顶帽头，穿大袍外穿马褂或坎肩，大袍要大开气，下面肥袖长，长的能看不见手，走路时左手提着开气，斜拉着膀子，摇头晃脑的才够得上这行人的“嘎”样。当然他们在办案时，是要化装的，也应该是短衣服小打扮，他们上曹先生家，先上房后叫门是对的。亲爱的同志们，扮演他们这黑门坎的人。非要表现出意狠心毒手头辣，外带损奸坏才够样。
    亲爱的同志们，我从心里爱上了您们，我要求同您们作革命的战友，您们如哪会有时间，请告诉我，我去看您们，再见。
