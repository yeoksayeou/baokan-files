An agricultural cooperative outside the Hexi District of Tianjin Municipality, after the dispatched cadres arrived, first treated them to a meal of noodles, and the next day held a lavish banquet to welcome the dispatched cadres, with good dishes that even the dispatched cadres couldn't name. Some agricultural cooperatives even prepared a large amount of cash before the dispatched cadres arrived, intending to purchase things for them. The responsible comrades of these agricultural cooperatives may have good intentions in welcoming the dispatched cadres, but they lack the spirit of diligence and thrift in managing the cooperative's finances. It's also unlikely that they obtained the consent of the cooperative members for such lavish spending, which means they lack the spirit of democratic management.

Of course, it is a good thing that the members of the agricultural cooperative, upon hearing that the cadres dispatched to their cooperative are about to arrive, rush to clear out houses, prepare food, vegetables, furniture, and farming tools to help the dispatched cadres solve problems related to housing, food, and production tools; that they welcome the dispatched cadres with gongs and drums and great joy upon their arrival; and that they patiently teach the dispatched cadres how to do farm work afterward. These are all good phenomena and necessary things to do. However, the extravagance and waste of lavish banquets, like that of the agricultural cooperative outside the Hexi District of Tianjin, is something that should not be done.

### 没有必要大摆酒席

　　没有必要大摆酒席
    天津市河西区郊外的一个农业社，在下放干部到达以后，先请吃了一顿捞面，第二天又大摆酒席，为下放干部接风，吃的好些菜连下放干部都叫不出名字来。还有的农业社，下放干部还没有到，就准备了大批现款，打算替他们购置东西。这些农业社的负责同志们，对于欢迎下放干部的热情也许是好的，但他们对于处理社里的钱财，却缺乏勤俭办社的精神，他们要这样大肆挥霍，也未必取得了社员们的同意，那他们就缺乏民主办社的精神了。
    当然，农业社的社员们，听见下放到本社的干部快要到来，就赶紧腾房子、准备粮食、蔬菜、家具和农具，帮助下放的干部解决住、吃和生产工具等问题；下放干部到来的时候，他们敲锣打鼓、欢天喜地的欢迎；以后又耐心地教下放干部做农活。这些，都是好现象，也是很必要做的事情。可是，像天津河西区郊外那个农业社那样大摆酒席的铺张浪费现象，却是很不应该做的事。
