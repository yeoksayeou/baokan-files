    They Participate in Labor at the Forestry Farm
    By Our Correspondent Dé Xiān
    At the construction site of the Laizhou Forestry Farm (Nanping, Fujian), people often see young men and women wearing worn-out blue uniforms. Some are weeding on the hillsides, and others are reclaiming wasteland at the foot of the mountains. If the villagers didn't tell you, who would know that they are cadres sent to work at the grassroots level? They are newly transferred here from the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and the League School newspaper office.
    The Laizhou Forestry Farm is one of the larger forestry farms in the mountainous area of northern Fujian. The entire farm has over 40,000 mu of forest land, mostly distributed on sparsely populated high mountains hundreds to over a thousand meters above sea level. The farthest is more than twenty li away from the farm headquarters, and the nearest is also five or six li away. These young people have started their intense and happy labor in these overlapping high mountains.
    Battle in the Valley – Burning the Mountains
    It was already past 3:00 PM when the farm director, Zheng Yangguang, carrying a water bottle, led these cadres who had been sent down – the new workers – to the Baozhu Mountain construction site to participate in burning the mountains. It was more than twenty li from here to the construction site, and all mountain roads. After crossing many hills and passing through forests more than ten li long, they finally arrived at the Baozhu Mountain construction site, more than 1,000 meters above sea level.
    That night, the night sky had no stars and no moon. Under the guidance of the production team leader, this group of new workers participated in their first mountain burning at the Shui Dui Keng (mountain name). Burning the mountains is a very new thing for people who grew up in the city, but it is also a very dangerous thing. In order to prevent a spark from flying into the forest area and burning the forest, Cheng Ke, the chief of the cadre section of the Organization Department of the Provincial Committee, who had never participated in labor before, climbed to the mountainside with a torch like a sentry on the front line, and lit a fire on the pile of weeds. Like a sentry on the front, he watched every spark. He once rushed into the forest area several times to fight the mountain fire in order to put out the sparks. The fierce smoke made his eyes tear and his face ache, but he always insisted on observing the sudden sparks near the fire line. He told me: If a small spark flies into the forest area, what a great loss it would bring to the country.
    At 3:00 AM, the nearby hillside had been burned. Suddenly, a terrible signal came from a distance. The sound of gongs and whistles resounded through the night sky, telling people that a fire had occurred in the distant forest area because sparks had crossed the fire line. At this time, Cheng Ke risked his life and rushed to the scene of the accident – the Yichao Forest Area – through the newly burned and still burning hillside for rescue. Thanks to the active rescue of the old and new workers, a major disaster was averted. That night, the old and new workers burned more than 1,200 mu of barren mountains.
    Changes and Joys Brought by Labor
    At the first crow of the rooster, the new workers have to set out with the old workers. Here, climbing a high hillside takes nearly ten li, and a low one also takes three or five li. Even so, they are no longer as tired as they were at the beginning.
    Their lunch is eaten at the construction site on the high mountains, and the utensils used are mostly taken from local materials. The rice bowls are replaced by mao bamboo tubes more than five inches high and three inches in diameter, and the chopsticks are made of branches or thin bamboo. It is inconvenient to buy vegetables in the mountain towns. Although they only have two salted fish the size of fingers or some vegetables for each meal, they are all very satisfied, and they always eat every grain of rice in the bamboo cans. In the past, each person only ate 14 liang of rice a day (28 jin of rice per month), but now each person eats 7 liang of rice per meal (40 jin of rice per month).
    After participating in labor production, they wear old clothes whether they are working in the mountains or resting in the dormitory. It wasn't like this before. They told me that in the past, everyone was unwilling to wear patched clothes, for fear that others would look down on them. They often stuffed clothes with a small hole or a torn pocket into the bottom of the box, ready to make wiping cloths. But now they have all changed their views. They have turned out the broken clothes that have been hidden for seven or eight years from the bottom of the box, sewed and mended them, and now no one thinks it is a disgrace to wear these clothes.
    Labor brings joy to people. Although they are covered in sweat from work, they are unwilling to rest during the work break. They like to walk around in the woods, looking for wild fruits to eat, such as乌饭子 (Vaccinium bracteatum), 枣禾子 (Zaohezi), wild chestnuts! Everyone's mouths are covered in ink.
    In the evening, they become active again in the vast forest area. They sing their favorite songs to their heart's content. Then the laughter, applause, and singing are intertwined. Imagine how happy their lives are!
    Workers' Help and Care
    In the first few days of starting work, they encountered many difficulties. They told me that on the first day of labor, everyone didn't even know how to wear straw sandals, and they turned around with the hoe handle, and no one knew what to do; climbing uphill was like a hunchback pulling a rope, and going downhill was like a child sitting on a slide, digging thatch heads was like chopping hard firewood... But all these difficulties were slowly overcome with the enthusiastic help of the workers.
    Cao Zhibin, a cadre from the Provincial League School who had never touched a hoe, complained that the hoe was disobedient because it jumped around like a ball when it touched the grass roots because he couldn't dig thatch heads. The old worker Lin Xiaming was afraid that he would cut his foot, so he quickly taught him how to hold the hoe and how to dig thatch heads. Now he has not only learned some labor skills, but also his production efficiency has improved a lot compared with when he first started working.
    Zhang Dexin, a cadre from the Fujian Youth Daily, was always sweating from exhaustion due to his poor physical strength. Seeing that he was weak, the old workers always came to help him dig whether he was digging shrub roots or thatch heads. They said: Young man, we'll leave the big ones for us to do, you dig the small ones! But Zhang Dexin refused. He said: If I don't grit my teeth and work hard now, how can I be a good worker in the future?
    The workers also cared for the cadres sent to work at the grassroots level in their lives. One day, Zhou Xiuli, a cadre from the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, fell ill because he caught a cold. This made the workers very busy! Some cooked porridge for him, and some prepared to cook delicious dishes for him. So many people came to visit him in a small room, some asking: Old Zhou, are you feeling better? Some asked: What have you eaten? The workers were relieved only when Zhou Xiuli recovered from his illness. This is how they help and care for the cadres sent to work at the grassroots level who came here.
    Four Young Women
    In the office of the farm director, Zheng Yangguang, the farm director who had fought guerrillas for many years, always praised this group of cadres sent to work at the grassroots level when he talked to me. In his conversation, he also particularly praised the four young women who came here to work as workers. Zheng Yangguang said that in early November, these four young women, Ye Deping, Li Ming, Chen Biyu, and Wu Baomei, came here and asked the farm to assign them work before their butts were even warm from sitting down, so that they could participate in physical labor in the most difficult and most needed construction site. For this matter, the farm also held a meeting to discuss it. According to their physical condition, it was decided to assign them to the farm headquarters experiment group to do tree species registration and management work. But they were all unwilling in their hearts: not because the work was too heavy, but because it was too easy. After working for a day, the next day, they couldn't bear it any longer, and angrily came to the farm director to express their opinions, saying:
    "Comrade Farm Director, we are here to participate in physical labor... How can we do it if you want us to sit in the office!"
    Later, the farm assigned them to grow vegetables, but after working for two and a half days, they came up with another idea, saying that the work was too boring, and asked the farm to allow them to go to the production team. Under their firm request, the farm agreed to their request. For the convenience of going to work, they happily moved their bedding from the farm headquarters to the Laizhou construction site that night.
    Every morning, when people are still asleep, these young women go to work with the workers. They all said that they would train themselves to become genuine workers through labor.

    他们在林场参加劳动
    本报记者　德籼
    在莱州林场（福建南平）的工地上，人们经常能见到穿着破旧蓝色制服的男女青年，他们有的在山坡上除草，有的在山脚下开荒，要不是村里人说，谁能知道他们是下放干部，他们是才从共青团福建省委及团校团报机关中抽调到这里来的。
    莱州林场是闽北山区较大的林场之一。全场共有林地面积四万多亩，大都分布在拔海数百公尺至一千多公尺的人烟稀少的高山上。远的离场本部有二十多华里，近的也有五、六华里。这些青年人，就在这些重重叠叠的高山上开始了紧张而又愉快的劳动。
    山谷里的战斗——炼山
    已是下午三点多钟，场长郑仰光背起水壶，领着这些下放干部——新工人到宝珠山工地上去参加炼山。这里离工地有二十多华里，而且全是山路。翻过许多山坡，穿过长达十多华里的森林，他们才到了拔海一千多公尺的宝珠山工地。
    这天晚上，夜空没有星星，也没有月亮。这批新工人，在生产队长的指导下，在水堆坑（山名）参加了第一次的炼山。
    从没参加过劳动的团省委组织部干部科长程科，为了使自己很快成为一个熟练工人，他不顾黑夜山路难行，同工人们一起拿着火把爬到半山腰里，在杂草堆上点起火来。炼山对于生长在城市的人来说，是一件很新鲜的事，但也是很危险的事。为了不让一颗火星飞进林区，烧着森林，程科像阵地上的哨兵一样，拿着打火具——松枝，沿着附近的山坡，全力注视着每一颗火星飞越的动向。他曾经为了扑灭火星，还几次窜到林区里，与山火搏斗。猛烈的烟火把他两眼熏得泪水直流，脸部发痛，可是他始终坚持在火路线旁观察突如其来的火星。他告诉我：只要有一颗小小的火星飞进林区，那就会给国家带来多么大的损失。
    深夜三点钟，附近的山坡已经炼好了，突然远处传来了令人可怕的信号，嘡嘡的锣声和哨子声，顿时响彻夜空，它告诉了人们：远处林区由于火星越过火路发生了火灾。这时，程科冒着生命危险，穿过刚炼过而且还在燃烧的山坡，赶往出事地点——依潮林区进行抢救。在老工人和新工人的积极抢救下，因而未酿成巨灾。这天晚上，老工人和新工人就炼好荒山一千二百多亩。
    劳动带来的变化和欢乐
    鸡叫头遍，新工人要和老工人出工赶路了。这里爬一个高的山坡要走近十华里，低的也要走三五华里。虽然这样，他们已不像刚开始那样劳累了。
    他们的午饭是在高山的工地上吃的，用的食具，大都是就地取材。饭碗，都是用五寸多高三寸多口径大的毛竹筒代替的，筷子也是用树枝或细竹子做的。山区上镇买菜不便，虽然他们每人每餐只有二条比手指大一点的咸鱼，或者是一些青菜下饭，但他们都吃得很满意，每餐终是把满竹罐的饭吃得一粒不剩的。过去每人一天只吃十四两米（每月吃二十八斤米），现在每人每餐却要吃七两米（每月吃四十斤米）。
    参加劳动生产以后，他们不论是上山劳动，或是在宿舍休息，都是穿着破旧的衣服。以前可不是这样。他们告诉我，过去大家都不愿穿补过的衣服，怕人家瞧不起，经常把破了一个小洞，或者是撕破了袋口的衣服，塞到箱子底下去，准备做抹桌布。可是现在他们都已改变了这种看法，把藏了七八年的破衣服，都从箱子底下翻出来，缝补后穿了，现在谁也没有认为穿这些衣服是丢脸的事了。
    劳动给人们带来了欢乐。他们劳动时虽然累得满头大汗，但是到了工间休息时，他们却不愿休息，他们爱在树林里，转来转去，找野果吃，什么乌饭子啦，枣禾子啦，野栗子啦！大家的嘴巴都是吃得墨墨黑的。
    到了傍晚，他们在辽阔的林区里，又开始活跃起来。他们尽情地唱起他们爱唱的歌曲来。接着人们的欢笑声、拍手声和歌唱声交织在一起。你想，他们的生活是过得多么愉快呀！
    工人们的帮助和关怀
    在开始劳动的头几天，他们碰到的困难可多着哩。他们告诉我，刚开始劳动这一天，大家连草鞋都不会穿，拿着锄头柄团团转，谁也不知道该怎么好；上山坡赛过驼背拉牵，下山坡有如孩子坐滑梯，挖茅草头好像劈硬柴头……。但是所有这些困难，他们在工人们的热情帮助下，终于慢慢克服了。
    从没摸过锄头的省团校干部曹致彬，由于不会挖茅草头，锄头一碰到草根，就像皮球似的乱跳，他还埋怨锄头不听话。老工人林吓明怕他砍伤自己脚面，赶快教他怎样拿锄头，怎么挖茅草头。现在他不但学会了一些劳动技术，而且生产效率还比刚开始劳动时提高了很多。
    福建青年报干部张德新由于体力差，干活老是累得一身汗。老工人看他力气小，不论挖灌木根或挖茅草头，总是跑来帮助他挖。他们说：小伙子，大的留着我们干，你挖小的吧！可是张德新却不依。他说：要不是现在咬紧牙关干，以后怎能当个好工人呢？
    工人们还从生活上来关怀下放干部。有一天，团省委干部周修犁因为受了寒，生起病来，这可忙坏工人啦！他们有的给他煮稀饭，有的还准备给他烧好吃的菜。一间小小的屋子，跑来探望他的人可多着哩，有的问：老周，身体好些吗？有的问：你吃过什么东西啦？直到周修犁的病好了，工人们才放心下来。他们就是这样帮助和关怀着来到这里的下放干部。
    四个女青年
    在场长办公室里，这位打过多年游击的场长郑仰光，每次跟我谈起这批下放干部时，他总是赞不绝口。在他的谈话中，他还特别表扬了来到这里当工人的四个女青年。郑仰光说，11月初，这四个女青年：叶德萍、黎明、陈碧玉、吴宝妹来到这里后，凳子还没坐热，她们就要求场里分配工作，好让她们到最艰苦最需要的工地上去参加体力劳动。为了这件事，场里还开会进行了研究。根据她们的体力情况，决定把她们分配到场本部试验组，搞树种登记、管理工作。但她们心里都不愿意：不是因为干这活太重，而是太轻松了。干了一天活后，第二天，她们再也忍耐不住了，就生气地跑来向场长提意见说：
    “场长同志，我们到这里是来参加体力劳动的……要我们坐办公室这怎么能行呢！”
    后来场里分配她们去种菜，可是干了二天半活，她们又生出枝节来，说干这活太没劲，要求场里允许她们到生产队去。在她们坚决的要求下，场里才同意了她们的要求。为了出工方便，她们当晚就高兴得把铺盖从场本部搬到莱州工地。
    每天清晨，人们还在熟睡的时候，这些女青年就和工人们一起上山干活去了。她们都表示要在劳动中把自己锻炼成为一个名副其实的工人。
