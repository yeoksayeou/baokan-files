Is the Cervical Cap Reliable for Contraception?
　　Song Hongzhao

When used in conjunction with contraceptive jelly, the cervical cap is one of the most reliable methods of contraception currently available.

However, many couples still lack confidence in using the cervical cap for contraception, considering it unreliable, too troublesome, and are unwilling to use it. To address this issue, I would like to briefly introduce the results of our recent survey on the use of cervical caps for your study and reference.

From 1955 to 1957, a total of 392 individuals came to the outpatient clinic of Peking Union Medical College Hospital to learn about cervical cap contraception. Among them, 109 were lost to follow-up due to job transfers, 93 did not use it after learning, and 50 had used it for less than half a year at the time of the survey, so the effectiveness of the cervical cap could not be confirmed. The remaining 140 had used it for more than half a year. According to the survey of these 140 people, only 23 became pregnant within two years after using the cervical cap, averaging about 12.2 pregnancies per 100 people per year. Before adopting cervical cap contraception, the pregnancy rate of these 140 people averaged 88.4 pregnancies per 100 people per year. In comparison, the difference is significant, indicating that cervical cap contraception does have a certain effect. Further analysis reveals that the reason for pregnancy in these 23 individuals, except for two, was due to not using the cervical cap and contraceptive jelly properly (13 did not use the cervical cap every time, four did not use it in combination with contraceptive jelly, and four removed the cervical cap too early).

According to the survey, during the use process, six people stopped using the cervical cap and contraceptive jelly because they wanted to have more children. Five of them became pregnant, and only one had not conceived six months after stopping contraception. Among the 140 people, during the 6-24 months of cervical cap use, no adverse effects on health or sexual life were observed. These materials are sufficient to demonstrate that the combined use of cervical caps and contraceptive jelly can indeed help us practice family planning and has no harm to the body.

Of course, from the perspective of convenience, it requires preparation before each sexual intercourse, and the cervical cap needs to be cleaned afterward, which is indeed not simple and somewhat troublesome. However, according to the experience and understanding of these 140 people, the so-called trouble is mostly due to unfamiliarity and lack of habit. If one can patiently study more before use, then practice makes perfect, and habit becomes natural, and one will not feel any trouble or discomfort. For the health of oneself and one's children, and for the happiness of the family and society, it is worthwhile and necessary to endure some trouble and overcome some difficulties. In order to do a good job in birth control, it is hoped that everyone will adopt this method of contraception more.

### 子宫帽避孕可靠吗？

　　子宫帽避孕可靠吗？
　　宋鸿钊
    子宫帽和避孕胶冻同时使用，它的效果是目前许多避孕方法中最可靠的一种。
    但目前还有许多夫妇对用子宫帽避孕没有信心，认为不可靠，太麻烦，不愿使用。为了要说明这个问题，特把我们最近对子宫帽使用情况所作的调查结果，作一些简单的介绍，供大家研究参考。
    自1955年至1957年二年中，来北京协和医院门诊学习子宫帽避孕的共有三百九十二人，其中一百零九人因工作调动失去了联系，九十三人学习后没有使用，五十人在调查时使用尚不到半年，不能肯定子宫帽的效果。其余一百四十人都曾使用了半年以上。根据对这一百四十人的调查，使用子宫帽以后，二年来只有二十三人受孕，平均相当于每一百人每年有十二点二人受孕。而这一百四十人在未采用子宫帽避孕以前，受孕率平均为每一百人每年有八十八点四人受孕。相比起来，差别很大，这说明子宫帽避孕确有一定的效果。再进一步分析，这二十三人所以受孕，除二人以外，其余二十一人都是因为没有很好使用子宫帽和避孕胶冻而受了孕（其中十三人因未曾每次都使用子宫帽，四人因未曾和避孕胶冻合用，四人因子宫帽取出太早）。
    据调查，在使用过程中，有六人因想再要孩子，停止使用子宫帽和避孕胶冻后，五人都已怀了孕，只有一人停止避孕六个月尚未受孕。一百四十人在使用子宫帽六——二十四个月之中，没有发现任何影响健康和性生活的现象。这些材料都足以说明子宫帽和避孕胶冻配合使用，确实可以帮助我们做好计划生育并且对身体毫无损害。
    当然，从方便来说，每次性交前都需作好准备，事后还需要清洗子宫帽，这确是不够简单，有些麻烦。但根据这一百四十人的经验和认识，都觉得所谓麻烦多数是不熟练和不习惯的缘故。如果在使用前能耐心地多学习一些时候，则熟能生巧，习惯成自然，就不感觉什么麻烦和不习惯了。为了自己和子女的健康，为了家庭和社会的幸福，忍受一些麻烦，克服一些困难，是值得的，也是应该的。为了做好节育工作，希望大家更多的采用这种避孕方法。
