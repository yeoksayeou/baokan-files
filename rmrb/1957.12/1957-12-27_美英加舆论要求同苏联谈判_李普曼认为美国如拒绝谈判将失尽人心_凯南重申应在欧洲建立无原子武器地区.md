Comprehensive report from our newspaper: Public opinion in the United States, Britain, and Canada widely advocates negotiations with the Soviet Union.

Washington News: Prominent American commentator Walter Lippmann published an article in the "New York Herald Tribune" on the 25th, advocating that the US government negotiate with the Soviet Union. He said, "If the United States stubbornly pursues a policy of refusing to negotiate, its position in the world will suffer incalculable and possibly irreparable damage." Lippmann said that the next three years will be "decisive years" for Western countries, "During this period, the United States and its allies will feel increasingly vulnerable."

Lippmann pointed out, "There is reason to speculate that in the next three years, the resolve of several major European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to support Dulles's position will be less than it is now. ... The real danger of Dulles's policy lies in the fact that if the United States does not achieve peace on the basis of negotiations, according to the intentions of Western countries, then neutral and nationalist sentiments will erupt, thereby undermining the alliance. ... The foreign policy formulated by Dulles will cause us to lose political leadership over the Western alliance."

London News: Former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, George Kennan, reiterated some of his recently published views on international issues in a British television discussion program. He once again stated that the suggestion of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe and the withdrawal of troops from European countries by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union should be adopted.

This television discussion was organized by the editorial department of the British Broadcasting Corporation. The arrangement of this program was due to the strong interest in Britain aroused by Kennan's recently published views. Participating in the discussion were British Air Marshal Slessor, "Economist" magazine editor Tylman, and television station representative Mackenzie.

At the beginning of the discussion, Tylman asked Kennan to explain his statement that there has never been a danger of a Soviet "military offensive." Kennan insisted on his original view, citing facts since the war to prove that the Soviet Union has never attacked other countries.

Kennan said: "I don't think there is any other way out of the difficult situation we are currently in, no other possibility of avoiding an arms race, except to separate the armies of the major powers from each other in Europe in one way or another, and it would be even better if this could be done in the Far East." He said: Due to the recent letters sent by Bulganin, "the current timing is of particular significance."

He believes that the Germans would be happy to accept the requirements related to the withdrawal of foreign troops regarding agreeing to German borders and implementing arms restrictions.

While emphasizing the "necessity" of solving the unified Germany issue, Kennan acknowledged that a unified Germany must withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

When discussing European security issues, Kennan advocated "concluding a European collective security treaty with the Soviet Union."

Kennan believes that if the plan to equip certain European countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with US nuclear weapons is realized, then solving the issue of establishing a neutral zone in Europe will be more difficult. Referring to the decision of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Paris meeting regarding the deployment of US nuclear weapons and rocket weapons in some Western European member states, Kennan pointed out that this decision "makes negotiations more difficult."

London News: British public opinion continues to comment on the Soviet peace initiatives and advocates holding high-level East-West talks.

The "New Statesman and Nation" magazine pointed out in its December 21 editorial: The Soviet peace initiative "reflects a sincere desire to stop a disaster from happening," "If (the West) merely responds with exacerbating the argument and giving away nuclear weapons, it is tantamount to choosing suicide."

The magazine then wrote: "When Mr. Khrushchev argues that the superiority of the two world systems should not be proven on the battlefield, but should be proven in a peaceful competition of development, he is making a sincere challenge based on his conviction that the superiority of communism surpasses the superiority of Western forms of government."

Oxford University professor and political commentator Taylor also advocated in an article published in the "Sunday Express" that Britain abandon the dead end of continuing to stockpile nuclear weapons and hold high-level East-West talks.

Ottawa News: The Canadian public widely supports the proposal to convene high-level talks to resolve disarmament issues and ease international tensions.

Former Foreign Minister Pearson pointed out that the suggestions mentioned by Bulganin in his letter and by Khrushchev and Gromyko at the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting must be carefully considered and analyzed, and specific answers must be given to them.

The Ottawa "Citizen" published an editorial saying that the suggestion of convening a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss disarmament issues is beneficial because this suggestion provides a possibility for reflecting the views of the public in various countries on this major issue. The newspaper called on countries to take measures for peace.

### 美英加舆论要求同苏联谈判  李普曼认为美国如拒绝谈判将失尽人心  凯南重申应在欧洲建立无原子武器地区

    美英加舆论要求同苏联谈判
    李普曼认为美国如拒绝谈判将失尽人心
    凯南重申应在欧洲建立无原子武器地区
    本报综合报道　美国、英国和加拿大的舆论纷纷主张同苏联举行谈判。
    华盛顿消息：美国著名评论员李普曼25日在“纽约先驱论坛报”上发表文章，主张美国政府同苏联谈判。他说，“如果美国固执地实行拒绝谈判的政策，它在世界上的地位将会受到难以估计的、可能是无法挽救的损失”。李普曼说，今后三年对西方国家说来将是“决定性的三年”，“在这个时期内，美国和它的盟国会感到自己越来越脆弱”。
    李普曼指出，“有根据推测，在今后三年内，几个主要的北大西洋公约组织的欧洲成员国在支持杜勒斯的立场方面的决心，要比现在少，……杜勒斯政策的真正危险性在于：如果美国不根据西方国家意图，首先在谈判的基础上取得和平，那么就会爆发中立和民族主义的情绪，从而破坏联盟……美国由杜勒斯制订的外交政策，将会使我们丧失对西方联盟的政治领导。”
    伦敦消息：前美国驻苏大使凯南在英国电视座谈节目中重申了他最近发表过的关于国际问题的一些主张。他再次表示应该采纳关于在欧洲建立无原子武器地区以及美国、英国和苏联从欧洲国家撤军的建议。
    这次电视座谈是由英国广播公司编辑部组织的。安排这次节目是由于凯南最近发表的主张已经在英国引起了强烈的兴趣。参加这次座谈的有英国空军元帅斯莱瑟、“经济学家”杂志主编泰尔曼和电视站代表马肯齐。
    座谈开始时，泰尔曼要求凯南解释他的这种说法：从来不存在苏联发动“军事进攻”的危险。凯南坚持他原来的看法，他援引了战后以来的事实，证明苏联从来没有进攻过其他国家。
    凯南说：“我认为我们目前所陷入的困难处境没有任何别的出路，没有避免进行军备竞赛的任何其他可能性，只能用这样或那样的方式使大国的军队在欧洲彼此分离，如果可能在远东也这样做那就更好。”他说：由于布尔加宁最近发出了信件，“目前的时机是具有特殊意义的”。
    他认为德国人会乐于接受与撤退外国驻军问题有关的关于同意德国疆界以及实行军备限制的要求。
    凯南在强调指出解决统一德国的“必要性”的同时，承认必须使统一后的德国退出北大西洋集团。
    在谈到欧洲安全问题时，凯南赞成“同苏联缔结欧洲集体安全条约”。
    凯南认为，如果实现了用美国原子武器装备北大西洋集团某些欧洲国家的计划，那末解决建立欧洲中立地区问题就更加困难。在谈到北大西洋集团巴黎会议关于在一些西欧成员国境内配置美国核武器和火箭武器的决定时，凯南指出，这个决定“使谈判更加困难了”。
    伦敦消息：英国舆论界继续评论苏联的和平倡议，并且主张举行东西方高级会谈。
    “新政治家与民族”杂志在12月21日的社论中指出：苏联的和平倡议“反映了一种想要制止发生灾祸的倾向的真诚愿望”，“如果（西方）仅仅以加剧争论和施舍核武器来作为答复，那就等于选择自杀”。
    这家杂志接着写道：“当赫鲁晓夫先生主张两个世界制度的优越性不应当在战场上得到证明，而是应当在发展的和平竞赛中得到证明时，他是在提出一项真诚的挑战，这种挑战是以他深信共产主义的优越性超过西方的政府形式的优越性的这种信念为基础的。”
    牛津大学教授、政治评论员泰勒在“星期日快报”上发表的一篇文章中也主张英国抛弃继续储存核武器的绝路，而举行东西方高级会谈。
    渥太华消息：加拿大公众广泛支持关于召开高级会谈来解决裁军问题和缓和国际紧张局势的建议。
    前外长皮尔逊指出，对布尔加宁在信中以及赫鲁晓夫和葛罗米柯在苏联最高苏维埃会议上的发言中所提到的建议，必须加以慎重地考虑和分析，并且对它们作出具体的答复。
    渥太华“公民报”发表社论说，关于召开联合国大会特别会议来讨论裁军问题的建议是有益的，因为这个建议对反映各国公众对这个重大问题的看法提供了可能性。报纸呼吁各国为了和平采取措施。
