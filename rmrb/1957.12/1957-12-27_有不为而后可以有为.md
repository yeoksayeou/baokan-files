    Only by Not Doing Some Things Can We Accomplish Other Things
    Wu Lü
    The development of the Tianjin local steel rolling industry is in line with the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
    More: The output has increased from more than 23,000 tons to more than 190,000 tons. If the expansion project under construction is included, the annual production capacity can reach 250,000 tons. It can be said to be a lot.
    Fast: This is only a matter of five years, it can be said to be fast.
    Good: The variety has increased, and the quality has improved, this is good.
    Economical: The profit in just two years is equivalent to ten times the total national investment in five years, which can be called economical!
    What experiences does the Tianjin local steel rolling industry have in implementing the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results? The most important thing is to concentrate the use of national investment. Money is spent in the most important places, and what can be saved is saved. Non-productive construction is like this, accounting for only 2% of the total investment; productive construction is also like this. New equipment is installed in old factory buildings. If it doesn't fit, the factory building is slightly lengthened. As long as the equipment can perform efficiently, there is no need for the factory building to be so tall and beautiful.
    This is what Mencius said: "A man must have things he will not do, and then he can do great things."
    However, some comrades do not implement the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results in this way. In their eyes, there is no sense of priority. They are greedy for everything, wanting more productive construction and more non-productive construction; they want everything to be fast, the equipment urgently needed for production is quickly installed, and the equipment that is not urgently needed is also quickly installed; they want everything to be "good", the equipment must be first-class, and the dormitories must be beautiful... As a result, it runs counter to the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Regardless of whether it is needed or possible, everything must be more, faster, and "better", and the state's limited construction funds are like being scattered in the sea, with no effect.
    For these comrades, I advise them to remember a truth: to implement the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, we must implement the policy of focusing on key construction and the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, that is, only by not doing some things can we accomplish other things.

    有不为而后可以有为

    天津地方轧钢工业的发展，是符合多快好省的建设方针的。
    多：产量从二万三千多吨提高到十九万多吨，若是把正在施工的扩建工程计算在内，年生产能力可以达到二十五万吨。不可谓不多。
    快：这不过是五年当中的事，不可谓不快。
    好：品种增加了，质量提高了，这就是好。
    省：仅两年的利润就相当于五年内国家投资总额的十倍，可谓省矣！
    天津地方轧钢工业贯彻多快好省的建设方针有些什么经验呢？最主要的一条就是集中使用国家投资。钱都花在最关紧要的地方，可省的则省。非生产性建筑是如此，以致只占全部投资的2％；生产性建筑也是如此。新设备安在旧厂房里，安不下就把厂房略加长一些。只要设备能发挥效率，并不图厂房多么高大，美观。
    这也就是孟子所说的：“人有不为也，而后可以有为”。
    然而，有些同志不是这样来贯彻多快好省的建设方针的。在他们眼中，无所谓轻重缓急。一切都贪多，生产性建筑要多，非生产性建筑也要多；一切都求快，生产上迫切需要的设备快快安装起来，并非急需的也快快安装起来；一切都要“好”，设备要第一流的，宿舍也要漂漂亮亮的……其结果，恰恰同多快好省的建设方针背道而驰。不管是否需要，是否可能，一切都要多、都要快、都要“好”，国家有限的建设资金就像撒在大海里一样，见不到什么效果。
    对于这些同志，奉劝他们熟记一条真理：要贯彻多快好省的方针，必须贯彻重点建设的方针，勤俭建国的方针，也就是有不为，而后可以有为。
