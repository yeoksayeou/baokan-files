Xinhua News Agency, 27th: New York Dispatch: The American "Newsweek", in its advance publication of the December 30th issue, stated: A "pressure to hold summit talks" has emerged both within and outside the United States.

The magazine stated: The United States not only felt the pressure from Western Europe for negotiations from the Paris NATO meeting, but also Eisenhower, upon returning from Paris, discovered that pressure for a summit meeting was also growing within Congress.

"Newsweek" stated: "Eisenhower's impression from the Paris meeting was that the heads of other NATO countries generally believed that in this age of super weapons, the door to peace must be kept open."

It also said: "Eisenhower learned that similar pressure was developing within Congress, even within the Republican Party. Democrats are busy broadcasting their arguments in favor of negotiations. A dozen Democratic congressmen jointly submitted a petition last week, accusing the government of refusing to negotiate with Soviet leaders. Several powerful figures on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee—Fulbright, Mansfield, Humphrey, and Sparkman—have also begun to step up their calls for a summit meeting."

The magazine pointed out: Secretary of State Dulles and Republican Senators Bridges and Knowland still stubbornly oppose negotiations, "but some Republican congressmen, who originally supported the government's opposition to such negotiations, have begun to waver."

The magazine said, "Before leaving for Paris, Dulles told his friends that if Eisenhower agreed to hold talks with Russian leaders, he would resign."

Xinhua News Agency, 27th: New York Dispatch: "New York Times" Washington correspondent Schmidt, in a dispatch, believes that although the Paris meeting reached agreements "in principle" on establishing medium-range missile bases in Western Europe and other items, whether these are "covering up unresolved differences among Western countries" will at least have to wait until "the military conference to be held next spring and the NATO foreign ministers meeting next May, or even years later, to determine."

Schmidt pointed out that whether the American plan can succeed "to a large extent" depends on the "balance of power" between the two camps. He admitted that the United States has now lost its advantage on this issue, and the Soviet Union has "surpassed the United States in some major aspects of determining strength."

Schmidt said that in the new situation, the "theory of deterrence and massive retaliation advocated by the United States is no longer applicable." He pointed out that the current American plan to deploy medium-range missiles in Western Europe, and the realization of this matter will be at least a year or two later, and whether America's allies can maintain confidence in the United States during this period is very questionable.

He believes that Bulganin's letters have brought "danger" to NATO, and the "problem" facing the United States "will be to maintain this alliance, preventing any part of it from pursuing neutralism, and preventing any part of it from swallowing the 'chronic poison', that is, accepting the proposal to denuclearize Central Europe."

    不许杜勒斯之流挡住和平大门
    美国国内外要求谈判压力增长
    美记者认为原子备战计划在西欧难行通
    新华社27日讯　纽约消息：提前出版的12月30日一期美国“新闻周刊”说：美国国内外都出现了一种“要求举行最高级会谈的压力”。
    这家杂志说：美国不仅从巴黎的北大西洋公约组织会议感到西欧要求谈判的压力，而且艾森豪威尔从巴黎回来的时候发现国会内要求举行最高级会议的压力也在增长。
    “新闻周刊”说：“巴黎会议给艾森豪威尔的印象是，其他北大西洋公约组织国家的元首普遍认为，在这超级武器时代，必须保持通向和平的门户开放。”
    他还说：“艾森豪威尔得悉国会内，甚至共和党内也正在发展类似的压力。民主党人正忙于广播他们赞成谈判的论点。十二名民主党议员上星期联名提出了一份请愿书，指责政府拒绝同苏联领袖谈判的做法。参议院外交委员会内几位有力人物——富布赖特、曼斯菲尔德、汉弗来和斯巴克曼——也开始在加紧催促举行最高级会谈。”
    杂志指出：国务卿杜勒斯、共和党参议员布里奇斯和诺兰等仍然死硬地反对谈判，“但是有些共和党议员原先对政府反对这种谈判的态度的支持已经开始动摇”。
    杂志说，“杜勒斯在动身去巴黎之前对他的朋友说，如果艾森豪威尔同意同俄国领袖举行会谈，他就要辞职不干。”
    新华社27日讯　纽约消息：“纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者施密特在一篇通讯中认为：巴黎会议虽然在“原则上”达成了要在西欧建立中程导弹基地等项协议，但是这些到底是否是“掩盖了西方国家尚未解决的分歧”，至少要等到“明年春季举行的军事会议和明年5月的北大西洋公约组织外长会议，或者甚至几年以后，才能断定”。
    施密特指出，美国的一套打算能否能得逞“在很大程度上”是要取决于两大阵营的“力量对比”的。他承认在这个问题上现在美国已经丧失了优势，苏联已经“在决定实力的某些主要方面”超过了美国。
    施密特说，在新的形势下，美国所鼓吹的“威慑力量和大规模报复的理论已经不适用了”。他指出目前美国计划在西欧设置中程导弹，而这件事情的实现至少是在一年或两年以后，而美国的盟国能否在这个时期中保持对美国的信心却很成问题。
    他认为布尔加宁的信件给北大西洋公约组织带来了“危险”，美国所面临的“问题将是保持这个联盟，不使它的任何部分奉行中立主义，防止它的任何部分吞服‘慢性毒药’，即接受使中欧非核武器化的建议”。
