Why do onions and garlic make people cry?
    Every housewife has the experience that she often sheds many tears when cutting a large amount of scallions (or onions) and garlic. It turns out that scallions contain a substance called acrolein, and garlic contains crotonaldehyde. Both acrolein and crotonaldehyde can be volatilized into vapor. When we cut them, this vapor diffuses, causing people to cry.
    Although onions and garlic can make people cry, eating them appropriately is beneficial to the human body because they have a bactericidal effect. Generally, eating a small clove of garlic with a meal can kill bacteria in the mouth and is very helpful in preventing respiratory infections.
    Some people are afraid of having a bad breath after eating onions and garlic and dare not eat them. This garlic and onion smell can be completely avoided as long as you chew a betel nut or a small pinch of tea in your mouth after a meal to get rid of the onion and garlic smell.

    葱蒜为什么能使人流泪
    每个主妇都有这样的经验，就是每次切大量的大葱（或洋葱头）和蒜时，常会流许多眼泪。原来大葱中含有一种叫做丙烯醛的物质，大蒜中含有丁烯醛。丙烯醛和丁烯醛都能挥发成蒸气，当我们切的时候，这种蒸气就随着扩散开来，使人流泪。
    尽管葱蒜能使人流泪，但是适当的食用它对人体有益处，因为它们具有杀菌的作用。一般的人在吃饭时吃一小瓣蒜，可以杀死口腔内的细菌，对于防止呼吸道传染病有很大帮助。
    有人怕吃了葱蒜讲话时有臭味，不敢吃。这种蒜味和葱味是完全可以避免的，只要你饭后放一粒槟榔或一小撮茶叶在口中嚼嚼，就可以除去葱蒜味。
