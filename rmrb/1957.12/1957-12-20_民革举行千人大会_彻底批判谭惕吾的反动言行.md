    Xinhua News Agency, December 19th: The Central Committee and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the KMT Revolutionary Committee recently jointly held a meeting of nearly a thousand people to comprehensively and systematically expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary words and deeds of the rightist Tan Tiwu in opposing the Communist Party, the people, and socialism.
    Prior to this meeting, many organizations and groups had already exposed and criticized the reactionary words and deeds of the rightist Tan Tiwu. However, Tan Tiwu, in her so-called confession and self-criticism at this meeting, still refused to confess her major crimes and did not sincerely bow her head to admit her guilt, which aroused widespread anger among the attendees.
    Tan Tiwu was a vanguard of the bourgeois rightists' frenzied attack on the Communist Party. After the start of the anti-rightist struggle, Tan Tiwu not only refused to bow her head and admit her guilt, but also tried every means to "settle accounts" and "counterattack." She slandered the People's Daily's June 8th editorial "What is the Reason?" and the People's Daily, Xinhua News Agency, and other reports about her reactionary remarks, claiming that they were "political frame-ups" against her. Even recently, she described her heinous and blatant crimes of opposing the Communist Party, the people, and socialism as merely a "revisionist ideological" problem, attempting to cover up and minimize her guilt. Liu Zehzi, a student from the High School Attached to the People's University, prepared to expose Tan Tiwu's crimes of poisoning her at this meeting. Tan Tiwu actually threatened her during a break in the meeting, which aroused strong dissatisfaction and indignation from the surrounding masses. All of the above facts show that Tan Tiwu is a stubborn fortress among the bourgeois rightists and has always adopted a resistant attitude towards the serious anti-rightist struggle.
    More than ten people, including Xiong Kewu, Jiang Guangnai, Wang Kunlun, Zhu Yunshan, and Chu Xichun, spoke at the meeting, exposing and criticizing the rightist Tan Tiwu. Li Yifei and Cheng Xiaoxia, students from the Law Department of the People's University, revealed a large number of facts about the collusion between the three rightists, Tan Tiwu, Lin Xiling, and Huang Shaohong. Liu Zehzi, a student from the High School Attached to the People's University, angrily accused the rightist Tan Tiwu of her various acts of poisoning her.

    民革举行千人大会
    彻底批判谭惕吾的反动言行
    据新华社19日讯　民革中央委员会和北京市委员会最近联合举行将近千人的大会，对右派分子谭惕吾反共、反人民、反社会主义的罪恶言行，作了全面、系统的揭露和批判。
    在这次大会之前，许多机关、团体对右派分子谭惕吾的反动言行已经进行过揭露和批判，可是谭惕吾在这次大会上所谓交代和检查中，仍然拒不交代她的重大罪行，没有真诚低头认罪，激起了到会群众普遍的愤怒。
    谭惕吾是资产阶级右派猖狂向共产党进攻的急先锋。反右派斗争开始后，谭惕吾不仅不低头认罪，还千方百计地进行“倒算”和“反攻”。她诬蔑人民日报6月8日“这是为什么”的社论和人民日报、新华社等关于她反动言论的报道，都是对她的“政治陷害”。直到最近，她还把她穷凶极恶、赤裸裸的反共、反人民、反社会主义的种种罪恶，说成只是一个“修正主义思想”问题，企图掩盖和缩小她的罪责。人民大学附属中学学生刘则智，准备在这次大会上揭露谭惕吾毒害她的罪行，谭惕吾居然在大会休息的时候，对她进行威胁，引起了周围群众十分的不满和愤慨。以上一系列的事实，都说明谭惕吾是资产阶级右派当中的一个顽固堡垒，对严正的反右派斗争，始终是采取抗拒的态度。
    在大会上发言揭露、批判右派分子谭惕吾的有熊克武、蒋光鼐、王昆仑、朱蕴山、楚溪春等十余人。人民大学法律系学生李逸飞、程晓霞揭露了谭惕吾、林希翎、黄绍竑三个右派分子互相勾结的大量事实。人民大学附属中学学生刘则智愤怒地控诉了右派分子谭惕吾对她的种种毒害。
