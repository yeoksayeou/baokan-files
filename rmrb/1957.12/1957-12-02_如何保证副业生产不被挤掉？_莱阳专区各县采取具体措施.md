　Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 30th – Amidst the current upsurge of winter agricultural production, how can we ensure that sideline production is not squeezed out? Counties on the Shandong Peninsula are taking specific measures.

　　Currently, the vast number of farmers and cadres in counties across the Shandong Peninsula are actively preparing manpower and resources with firm determination to carry out winter farmland water conservancy construction. Many places have already launched into enthusiastic action. However, the situation for sideline production in various places is different. Many townships and communes lack specific plans; some communes do not even mention sideline production when discussing work. Even at the county level of leadership, most only mention it briefly when arranging work, lacking practical and specific organizational leadership.

　　Analysis indicates that the main reasons for the current neglect of sideline production by agricultural cooperatives are: First, there is a lot of work and heavy tasks this winter, such as the collection of late autumn crops, winter plowing and loosening, afforestation, water conservancy construction, income distribution, grain unified purchase, wheat field management, and party rectification and commune consolidation, all of which are very important and time-sensitive tasks. Many agricultural cooperatives have difficulty balancing these tasks within the same timeframe, facing difficulties in terms of manpower and funds. Second, due to the thorough criticism of capitalist ideology and crackdown on illegal speculative activities during the great debate, some cadres and the masses mistakenly believe that there is nothing to do with sideline production this winter, while neglecting the broad avenues for legitimate sideline production and the profound potential of household sideline occupations.

　　In light of this situation, the responsible comrades of the CPC Laiyang Prefectural Committee believe that if we do not promptly remind everyone to pay attention to this phenomenon and take practical and effective measures, we may repeat the lesson of losing sideline production during the upsurge of water conservancy construction in the winter of 1955, leading to a general economic strain in the economic life of agricultural cooperatives and their members next spring, resulting in passivity. Therefore, they requested all counties, townships, and cooperatives to make practical arrangements for winter sideline production. The CPC Fushan County Committee, at a meeting of county party organization secretaries and township heads on November 21st, requested party organization secretaries and township heads in all townships to strengthen the organization and leadership of sideline production, go deep into each agricultural cooperative to help them arrange various tasks well, and ensure that each cooperative has a certain amount of labor and funds invested in sideline production. At the same time, the county committee also convened meetings of relevant units such as supply and marketing cooperatives, service bureaus, handicraft cooperatives, and tax bureaus to study how to support farmers' sideline production in terms of raw materials, sales channels, and other aspects. According to preliminary calculations, as long as all kinds of sideline occupations that are currently feasible are carried out, the county can earn more than two million yuan from livestock, poultry, weaving, embroidery, and transportation alone this winter and next spring.

### 如何保证副业生产不被挤掉？  莱阳专区各县采取具体措施

    如何保证副业生产不被挤掉？
　  莱阳专区各县采取具体措施
    新华社莱阳30日电　在今年冬季农业生产高潮中，如何保证副业生产不被挤掉？山东半岛各县正在采取具体措施。
    目前，山东半岛各县广大农民和干部，正以坚决的意志积极进行人力物力的准备，开展冬季兴修农田水利运动，许多地方并已经热烈地行动起来。但是，各地的副业生产却是另一番情况。许多乡、社没有具体的计划安排；有些社在研究工作时根本不提到副业生产。即使是县一级的领导，也多半只在布置工作时提一下，缺乏切实具体的组织领导工作。
    据分析，当前各农业社忽视副业生产的原因主要是：一、由于今年冬季工作多，任务重：如晚秋作物的收藏、冬耕冬刨、植树造林、水利建设、收益分配、粮食统购、麦田管理和整党整社等，都是十分重要而又有时间性的工作，许多农业社要在同一时间内把这些工作统筹安排得好，无论在人力或资金方面，都有顾此失彼的困难；二、由于在大辩论中彻底批判了资本主义思想，打击了非法投机活动，有些干部和群众误认为今冬副业没有什么搞头了，而对于正当的副业生产的广阔门路和家庭副业的深厚潜力忽视。
    根据这一情况，中共莱阳地委负责同志认为，如果对这种现象不及早提醒大家注意，并采取切实有效的措施，那末，就有可能重复1955年冬在水利建设高潮中丢掉副业生产的教训，造成来春农业社和社员经济生活普遍紧张，工作被动。因此要求各县、乡、社对冬季副业生产作切实安排。中共福山县委已在11月21日全县党组织书记和乡长会议上，要求各乡党组织书记和乡长加强对副业生产的组织领导，深入各农业社帮助他们很好地安排各项工作，务使每个社都有一定数量的劳力和资金投入副业生产。同时，县委又召开了供销社、服务局、手工业社和税务局等各有关单位会议，研究了如何从原料、销路等各个方面来支持农民副业生产的问题。据初步计算，只要把当前有条件搞的各种副业都搞起来，今冬明春全县仅家畜家禽、编织、绣花和运输等四项即可收入二百多万元。
