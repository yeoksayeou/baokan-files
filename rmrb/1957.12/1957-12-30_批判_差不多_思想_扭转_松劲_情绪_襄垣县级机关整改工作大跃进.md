Criticize the "Almost There" Mentality, Reverse the "Slackening" Mood
Xiangyuan County-Level Organs' Rectification Work Takes a Great Leap Forward

(Reported by this newspaper) After criticizing the "almost there" mentality, the rectification movement in Xiangyuan County-level organs, Shanxi Province, has entered a rectification upsurge.

The rectification movement in the directly affiliated organs of Xiangyuan County entered its third phase in early November. In less than half a month, thirty-two units of all sizes participating in the rectification throughout the county raised more than 2,300 opinions of various kinds. Many units have also achieved preliminary results in rectification, and some new atmospheres have begun to appear in their work. However, some units have developed the "almost there" mentality as a result. For example, the post and telecommunications bureau and the timber company have a total of thirty-five employees, and only eighteen of them raised some minor opinions. However, the leading comrades believed that there were no major problems in their units and wanted to bring the movement to a close. The rectification of some units lagged behind the airing of views. For example, employees of the department store raised 365 opinions, but only 72 were dealt with, accounting for only 19.7% of the total number of opinions raised.

After discovering the above problems, the Xiangyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of leading cadres from various units. Through summing up and checking, it was pointed out that the main problems in the current movement are that the airing of views is not deep or thorough enough, and that rectification is progressing slowly. This is mainly because the ideological concerns of the masses have not been completely eliminated, and some leading cadres still have the mistaken idea of "waiting to be rectified and fearing rectification," and their understanding of "drawing fire to themselves" is insufficient, and their determination is not strong. In order to reverse this situation, the meeting focused on criticizing harmful ideas such as "almost there." On the basis of raising ideological awareness and unifying understanding, the county committee adopted three specific measures: First, it emphasized that leading cadres should break down all misgivings, resolutely "draw fire to themselves," and take the lead in airing views. Second, it strengthened ideological work and encouraged the masses to air their views. Third, it strengthened the leading bodies for rectification in various units to overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible. At the same time, the opinions aired by the masses should be actively studied and dealt with in batches as quickly as possible, so as to achieve the goal of airing views, dealing with problems, and making improvements simultaneously.

After the meeting, various units adopted effective measures according to the arrangements of the county committee, which greatly promoted the rectification movement. According to statistics from thirty units, including the county committee and the department store, after checking and criticizing and overcoming the mood of slackening, 924 people aired 2,122 opinions of various kinds in ten days, more than twice the number of opinions aired in the previous ten days.

The rectification progress of various units has also accelerated. For example, after adjusting its forces, the bank's rectification team classified and ranked the opinions of the masses one by one, submitted them to various sections for collective discussion, and, according to the order of easy to difficult, dealt with a total of 241 opinions in three batches within half a month, accounting for 85% of the total number of opinions of the masses. At present, with the exception of six units such as the medicinal materials company and the veterinary station, about 70% of the opinions aired by other units have been dealt with.

### 批判“差不多”思想　扭转“松劲”情绪  襄垣县级机关整改工作大跃进

    批判“差不多”思想　扭转“松劲”情绪
    襄垣县级机关整改工作大跃进
    本报讯　山西省襄垣县级机关整风运动，经过批判“差不多”思想，之后，出现了整改高潮。
    襄垣县直属机关整风运动从11月上旬转入第三阶段。不到半月，全县参加整风的大小三十二个单位，共提出各种意见两千三百多条。许多单位在整改方面也取得了初步成绩，工作中开始出现了一些新气象。但某些单位由此产生了“差不多”思想。如邮电局、木材公司共有职工三十五人，仅有十八人放出了一些小意见，领导同志却因此认为本单位问题不大，要结束收场。有的单位整改赶不上鸣放，如百货公司职工提出三百六十五条意见，只处理了七十二条，仅占鸣放意见总数的19.7％。
    中共襄垣县委发现上述问题后，召开了各单位领导干部会议。通过总结检查，指出当前运动的主要问题是鸣放不深不透，整改进展缓慢。这主要是因为群众思想顾虑尚未彻底消除，某些领导干部仍然有“等挨整、怕整”的错误思想，对“引火烧身”认识不足，决心不大。为了扭转这种情况，会议集中地批判了“差不多”等有害思想。在提高思想，统一认识的基础上，县委采取了三项具体措施：第一，强调领导干部打破一切顾虑，坚决“引火烧身”，并带头鸣放。第二，加强思想工作，鼓舞群众鸣放。第三，充实各单位整风领导机构，克服无人负责现象。同时对群众鸣放出来的意见，要积极研究，迅速分批处理，做到边鸣放、边处理、边改进。
    会后，各单位根据县委布置，采取了有效措施，大大推动了整改运动。据县委会、百货公司等三十个单位统计，通过检查批判，克服了松劲情绪以后，十天时间共有九百二十四人鸣放出各种意见两千一百二十二条，超过前十天鸣放出的意见两倍多。
    各单位的整改进度也加速了。如银行整改小组经过调整力量后，对群众意见逐条分类排队，提交各股集体讨论，根据先易后难的顺序，半月内共处理了三批意见计二百四十一条，占群众意见总数的85％。目前除药材公司、兽医站等六个单位外，其他单位鸣放出来的意见都已处理了70％左右。
