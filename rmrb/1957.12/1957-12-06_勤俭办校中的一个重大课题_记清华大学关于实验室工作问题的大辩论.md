　　A Major Topic in Running Schools Thriftyly
　　——A Record of the Great Debate on Laboratory Work at Tsinghua University

　　The great debate on laboratory work has unveiled the prelude to the struggle between two lines on teaching and scientific research among teachers and laboratory staff at Tsinghua University.

　　Tsinghua University has fifty-seven laboratories. In recent years, the school's expenditure on laboratories has amounted to about one-third of the total school expenditure. It occupies an extremely important position in Tsinghua University's efforts to improve teaching quality and carry out scientific research.

　　However, in the past, there were still many serious shortcomings in laboratory work, such as waste and losses. In late October, as the school's rectification movement deepened, the Chinese Communist Party Committee of Tsinghua University launched teachers and laboratory staff to inspect laboratory work as one of the special topics of "rectifying laboratory work," and on the basis of exposing problems, seriously carried out debates. The Chinese Communist Party Committee of Tsinghua University believes that this is not just a problem of the "young master" style of extravagance and waste, but must be raised to the due ideological height, namely: how to implement the policy of running schools thriftily; how to attach importance to labor practice and the integration of theory with practice; and in the final analysis, how to run industrial universities according to socialist ideology as one of the important issues.

　　Exposing Waste Phenomena

　　After the school's rectification leading group convened an enlarged meeting on the rectification of laboratories, teachers from various departments and teaching and research groups went to the laboratories to count equipment and check accounts. The masses were very enthusiastic and posted hundreds of big-character posters, exposing many serious problems: some laboratories had no property accounts at all, some laboratory accounts were chaotic and corruption was found, some equipment was left unused for a long time after being purchased, and no one was responsible, and so on.

　　There was a laboratory technician in the soil mechanics laboratory who treated the laboratory as his "home," using magnetic dishes to fry peanuts and glass troughs to raise fish. After these situations were exposed, they aroused everyone's indignation. The construction laboratory of the Civil Engineering Department bought a multi-bucket excavator for 120,000 yuan, which was left unused for a long time, accumulating thick soil and growing grass. In some laboratories, electron tubes disappeared and were taken by individuals to assemble radios.

　　In the "Exhibition on Running Schools Thriftyly" held by the students, these startling figures could also be seen: the physics laboratory damaged more than 300 thermometers in two years. The electronics laboratory burned out thirteen electron tubes and four wattmeters in four months, worth a total of 1,600 yuan. Due to the carelessness of the students, the physics laboratory burned out more than 20 galvanometers due to excessive power, resulting in a loss of more than 11,000 yuan. The motor laboratory of the Electrical Engineering Department burned out seven oscilloscope vibrators, each worth 500 yuan. The general chemistry laboratory damaged 501 instruments such as beakers, measuring cylinders, and crucibles in one month, averaging about 17 pieces damaged per day. In addition, valuable balances and other items were also damaged. According to the person in charge of the school, the serious phenomenon of easily destroying people's property worth hundreds or thousands of yuan like this is that in some laboratories, every two to five years, the value of damaged physical and chemical instruments is almost equal to re-equipping a set.

　　In the Debate

　　After the problems were exposed, the school party committee guided everyone to conduct debates. The debate started with some specific issues in each unit.

　　Teachers of the Engineering Drawing Teaching and Research Group of the Mechanical Manufacturing Department raised such a question: "Waste is unavoidable in the process of teaching reform." Their reason was that because in the process of teaching reform, the teaching plan is often changed, and the data and teaching models have to be changed accordingly, which will inevitably cause waste.

　　After this opinion was put forward, it was opposed by many teachers. Everyone believed that although the above reasons can be used as one of the objective factors, it is not the main one. They cited some examples, saying that taking the Engineering Drawing Teaching and Research Group as an example, after the teaching reform, they never considered appropriately utilizing the original teaching models under the requirements of the new teaching plan, but instead discarded the entire set and put it into "cold storage," and designed a new set of models.

　　Teachers of the Mechanical Manufacturing and Machine Tool Teaching and Research Group debated a similar question: Someone said, "Since there are airplanes, why ride in ox carts?" That is to say, use modern things and not old equipment. This question was raised because the Mechanical Manufacturing and Machine Tool Teaching and Research Group purchased a coordinate boring machine worth more than 90,000 yuan. During the debate, some people believed that it was too wasteful from an economic point of view and unnecessary, and could be replaced by a universal machine tool. However, the opponents raised the above opinions. Other teachers used a popular analogy to refute this statement. They said: Generally speaking, raincoats are more convenient than umbrellas, but why do you only buy umbrellas and not raincoats! They believed that the fundamental problem was that some comrades lacked the idea of running schools thriftily and carefully calculating, and therefore blindly pursued advanced standards.

　　Teachers of the Automobile and Tractor Teaching and Research Office of the Power Machinery Department debated the issue of blindly pursuing luxury, beauty, and "the world's first."

　　This laboratory has an area of 4,000 square meters, and there are still many places that have not been utilized. The walls of some rooms are painted with high-grade paint all the way to the ceiling. Especially the fuel and lubricating oil testing room, not only has painted walls, tile floors, and painted tables, but even the table tops are made of marble. The original laboratory had a batch of display tables, and some people thought they were not good enough, so they remade a set, and specially wrapped them in aluminum skin. However, the person who designed this laboratory even "justified" saying: "It is not expensive to spend 200 yuan more to make the table top with marble. Now the 'thrift wind' is blowing, and five years later it will prove that I am correct."

　　In the debate, teachers had a further understanding of the erroneous idea of pursuing "the world's first" and not starting from the point of view of running schools thriftily. A few years ago, the staff of this laboratory always wanted to buy a new type of car or tractor whenever they saw one, striving to equip all specifications and types of vehicles completely. Now, there are sixteen cars and ten tractors in total, both original and newly purchased. However, only fifteen to thirty students do experiments here each time, and most of the cars and tractors are idle.

　　At the same time, the party and league members of this laboratory also launched a debate on the standards of waste. Someone said: "You can build laboratories with terrazzo, or you can build laboratories with thatched roofs and mud floors. What is the objective standard of waste?"

　　This issue was hotly debated. Many teachers finally believed that the statement that there is no objective standard for waste is wrong in itself, and in essence, it denies the existence of waste. Therefore, everyone said that to avoid waste, first of all, we must establish a sense of ownership, have the thrifty style of the working people, and think more about the difficulty of workers and peasants creating wealth. On the basis of being correct in ideological feelings and position, we can further grasp the three principles: (1) according to the possibility of the national economy; (2) meet the needs of teaching and scientific research; (3) implement the spirit of running schools thriftily.

　　Why Did These Shortcomings Arise?

　　In the debate, everyone exposed and criticized the departmentalism of some cadres.

　　The Water Conservancy Department has a high water tank, which could have been jointly used by the Water Supply and Drainage Laboratory of the Civil Engineering Department. However, the Civil Engineering Department started a new stove, spending 45,000 yuan more. The Hydraulic Structure Laboratory spent more than 6,500 yuan to make a large steel tank, but the hydraulics and hydraulic engineering laboratories near this laboratory had ready-made tanks that were not fully utilized.

　　In the debate, many comrades believed that departmentalism was also an important reason for the phenomenon of many materials being backlogged and equipment being duplicated. Someone also cited the example of Leningrad Institute of Technology in the Soviet Union, saying that there is no hydraulic laboratory there, and they borrow experimental equipment from other teaching and research groups to do experiments.

　　In the debate, teachers further clarified that one of the fundamental reasons for these serious shortcomings lies in their own neglect of labor practice and the neglect of the integration of theory with practice. Some teachers have very poor practical skills in the majors they teach, and are "industrious in limbs, ignorant of grains." Many "typical" examples have been exposed in these aspects. Some teachers in the teaching and research office never go to the laboratory and leave the task of tutoring experiments and correcting experimental reports to the laboratory technicians, so they do not understand the practical problems in many experiments, but some teachers still feel at ease.

　　On the Road to Improvement

　　This debate has achieved certain results in improving the school's experimental work. Some teachers and staff have withdrawn the orders from the school leaders after careful calculation, and some students have proposed to cherish the instruments. Now the debate is further deepening, and the school leaders will also equip some cadres for the laboratory and formulate some rules and regulations to strengthen this work.

　　勤俭办校中的一个重大课题
　　——记清华大学关于实验室工作问题的大辩论
　　新华社记者　朱继功
    实验室工作问题的大辩论，揭开了清华大学教师和实验室工作人员对于教学上和科学研究上两条路线的斗争的序幕。
    清华大学有五十七个实验室，学校几年来在有关实验室方面支出的经费，约相当于全校经费的三分之一。它对清华大学提高教学质量、开展科学研究占有极其重要的地位。
    但是过去实验室工作中还存在着浪费、损失等很多严重缺点，在10月下旬，当学校的整改运动进一步深入的时候，中共清华大学党委会就以“整顿实验室工作”作为专题之一，发动教师和实验室工作人员检查实验室的工作，并且在揭露问题的基础上，认真地开展辩论。中共清华大学党委认为，这不仅仅是铺张浪费的“大少爷”作风问题，必须提高到应有的思想高度来认识，就是：如何贯彻勤俭办校的方针问题；如何重视劳动实践和理论联系实际的问题；而归根结蒂，是怎样按照社会主义的思想办工业大学的重要问题之一。
      揭发浪费现象
    当学校整改领导小组召开了关于整顿实验室的扩大会议以后，各系、教研组教师们纷纷下实验室清点设备、清查账目。群众热情很高，贴出了几百张大字报，揭发了许多严重问题：有的实验室根本没有财产账目，有的实验室账目混乱并且发现有贪污现象，有的设备买来后长期搁置，无人负责等等。
    土力学实验室有个实验员，他以实验室为“家”，用磁皿炒花生，用玻璃槽养鱼，这些情况被揭发出来以后，引起了大家的愤慨。土木系施工实验室以十二万元买来一架多戽挖土机，长期搁置不用，积土很厚，长了青草。有的实验室里，电子管不翼而飞，被私人拿去装收音机了。
    在学生们举办的“勤俭办校展览会”上，也可以看到这些怵目惊心的数字：物理实验室两年中损坏的温度计达三百多支。电子学实验室四个月烧毁了十三个电子管，四架瓦特计，共值一千六百元。物理实验室由于学生们粗心大意，通电过多，烧坏了电流计二十多架，共损失一万一千多元。电机系拖动实验室烧坏的示波器振子七个，每个价值五百元。普通化学实验室一个月损坏烧杯、量筒、钳锅等仪器五百零一件，平均每天损坏十七件左右。此外，被损坏的还有贵重的天平等。像这样动辄成百上千元的人民财产轻易被毁的严重现象，据学校负责人说，有些实验室每隔二年——五年，损坏的物理和化学仪器的价值几乎等于重新置备一套。
        在辩论中
    问题揭开以后，学校党委就引导大家进行辩论。辩论是从每个单位的一些具体问题开始的。
    机械制造系工程画教研组教师提出了这样一个问题：“在教学改革的过程中，浪费是不能避免的”，他们的理由是：因为在教学改革过程中，教学计划经常变更，资料和教学模型就不得不随着有所改变，而这样势必造成浪费。
    这种意见提出以后，遭到了许多教师的反对。大家认为，虽然上述理由可以作为客观因素之一，但并不是主要的。他们举出一些实例说，就拿工程画教研组来说，教学改革以后就从来没有考虑过把原来的教学模型在新的教学计划要求下适当地加以利用，而是整套地废置不用，打入了“冷宫”，另外设计新的整套的模型。
    机械制造及机床教研组的教师辩论了一个相类似的问题：有人说“既然有了飞机，为什么还要坐牛车呢”，就是说要用现代化的东西，不用旧有的设备。这个问题是因为机械制造及机床教研组购置了一台价值九万多元的座标镗床，辩论中有人认为它从经济上来考虑太浪费，没有必要，可以用万能机床来代替。但是，反对的人提了上述意见。另外一些教师就打了一个通俗的比喻来反驳这种说法，他们说：一般说，雨衣比雨伞要方便些，但你为什么只买雨伞不买雨衣呢！他们认为根本问题是有的同志缺乏勤俭办校、精打细算的思想，因而是一味追求先进标准。
    动力机械系汽车拖拉机教研室教师辩论了盲目追求豪华、美观和“世界第一”问题。
    这个实验室拥有四千平方公尺面积，到现在还有很多地方没有被利用。有些房间的墙面用高级油漆一直漆到天花板。特别是燃料润滑油试验间，不仅有油漆墙、磁砖地、喷漆桌、连桌面都是用大理石做的。原来实验室有一批陈列桌，有些人嫌它不够好，就重做一套，还特地用铝皮包起来。但是设计这个实验室的人，竟还“理直气壮”地说：“用大理石做桌面，多花二百元不贵，现在刮的是‘节约风’，五年以后会证明我是正确的。”
    在辩论中，教师们对追求“世界第一”，不从勤俭办校观点出发的错误思想，有了进一步的认识。几年以前，这个实验室的工作人员每当见到一种新式规格的汽车、拖拉机，总想都买一辆，力求各种规格、型式的车辆配备齐全，应有尽有。现在，原有的和新买的共有了十六辆汽车，十台拖拉机。但是，在这里做实验的学生每次不过十五人到三十多人，绝大部分的汽车和拖拉机都闲着。
    与此同时，这个实验室的党、团员对浪费的标准也展开了辩论。有人说：“可以盖水磨石的实验室，也可以盖茅草屋和泥土地的实验室，什么是浪费的客观标准呢？”
    这个问题争论得很热烈，许多教师最后认为，所谓浪费没有客观标准的提法本身就是错误的，实质上就是否认有浪费现象的存在。因此大家说，要避免浪费，首先要树立起主人翁态度，要有劳动人民的勤俭作风，多想想工人农民创造财富的艰巨性，这样在思想感情和立场对头的基础上，进而掌握三个原则：（1）根据国家经济的可能性；（2）满足教学和科学研究的需要；（3）贯彻勤俭办校的精神。
　  为什么产生这些缺点？
    大家在辩论中，揭露了和批判了某些干部的本位主义。
    水利系有一个高水箱，原来满可以供给土木系给水排水实验室共同使用的。但土木系偏又另起炉灶，多花了四万五千元钱。水能结构实验室花了六千五百多元做了一个大钢槽，但是在这个实验室附近的水力学、水工实验室都有现成槽子并未充分利用。
    在辩论中很多同志认为造成许多器材积压、设备重复的现象，本位主义思想也是一个重要原因。有人还举出苏联列宁格勒工业大学的例子说，那儿没有水能实验室，借用其他教研组的实验设备，照样做实验。
    教师们在辩论中也进一步明确了这些严重的缺点的根本原因之一，是在于自己轻视劳动实践和轻视理论联系实际。部分教师对于自己所教授的专业方面的实际技能很差，是“四体不勤，五谷不分”。这些方面揭发出不少“典型”事例。有的教研室教师从来不下实验室，把辅导实验及改实验报告的任务都交给实验员负责，因而自己对好些实验中的实际问题不懂，可是有些教师还觉得心安理得。
    在改进的道路上
    这次辩论对改进学校实验工作已经取得了一定成效，有些教师和工作人员在精打细算以后，已向学校领导撤回了订货单，有些学生提出要爱护仪器。现在辩论正进一步深入中，学校领导方面也将为实验室配备一些干部，订立一些规章制度，以加强这方面的工作。
