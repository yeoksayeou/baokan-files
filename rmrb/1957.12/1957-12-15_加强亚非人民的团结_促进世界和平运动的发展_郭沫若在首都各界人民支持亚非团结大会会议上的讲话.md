Comrades and friends:

　　The Asian-African Solidarity Conference, jointly prepared by twenty-one Asian and African countries, will be held in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, starting on the 26th of this month.

　　As everyone knows: colonialism is the breeding ground for war, and Asia and Africa are the colonial spheres of influence of imperialism. Therefore, the awakening and unity of the Asian and African peoples is precisely to eliminate colonialism and eliminate war from the root. Therefore, this conference is a grand gathering to defend world peace.

　　This conference has sent invitations to the people of more than forty countries and regions in Asia and Africa, and it has broad representation. At the meeting, opinions will be exchanged on safeguarding world peace and many major issues related to the vital interests of the Asian and African regions. It can be expected that this meeting will be conducive to further strengthening the unity and friendship of the Asian and African peoples, will be conducive to further promoting the just struggle of the Asian and African peoples against colonialism and for national independence, and will be conducive to promoting the development of the world peace movement.

　　Today, representatives of people from all walks of life in our capital are holding a conference here, and we want to solemnly declare to the people of the world: our 600 million Chinese people wholeheartedly support the convening of this conference and warmly wish this conference success!

　　This conference is being held at a time when the world situation is favorable to the forces of peace and unfavorable to the forces of war. The awakened Asian and African people have always been active defenders of peace. In 1952, the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference was held in Beijing. In 1955, the Asian Solidarity Conference was held in Delhi. Since 1955, international conferences against nuclear weapons have been held in Japan for three consecutive times. In 1957, the World Peace Council was held in Colombo. In addition, various countries have widely launched movements against nuclear weapons, and have particularly expressed warm support for the struggle of the Egyptian and Syrian people to maintain peace and oppose aggression. These have repeatedly reflected the strong desire of the awakened Asian and African people to defend world peace.

　　Since World War II, the struggle of the awakened Asian and African people for national liberation, to maintain national independence, and to oppose colonialism has greatly shaken the colonial system of imperialism. In particular, the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung, the beautiful city of Indonesia, in April 1955, marked the unity of the Asian and African peoples on the basis of anti-colonialism; the Bandung spirit was produced, which not only helped the liberation of Asian and African countries, but also helped the liberation of oppressed nations all over the world. The era when colonialists arbitrarily exploited and enslaved is gone forever.

　　The past fate of our Chinese people and the fate of many countries in the Asian and African regions are common. We have long suffered from imperialist aggression and colonialist enslavement. Even now, American imperialists are still hostile to and threatening us, and occupying our territory of Taiwan. Therefore, when the Chinese people rejoice that we have embarked on the broad road of socialism, they pay special attention to the struggle of the people of Asian and African countries and oppressed nations all over the world for national liberation and to maintain national independence. We cheer for the victory of all countries and peoples who have achieved national independence. We support all countries and peoples who are holding high the banner of demanding independence and freedom and are carrying out heroic struggles. We unhesitatingly support all just actions to resist imperialist aggression in order to maintain the independence and sovereignty of their countries.

　　We are very pleased to see that the host of the conference—the Egyptian people—are standing at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle. Their victory in resisting the joint aggression of Britain, France, and Israel last year was a significant victory achieved in the struggle against colonialism, to maintain national independence, and to defend world peace in the past year. This victory proves that the imperialists' attempt to maintain and restore colonial rule and implement a policy of aggressive war through armed suppression is unworkable. This victory also proves that any oppressed nation, as long as it holds its destiny in its own hands, holds high the banner of national independence, and carries out a resolute and unyielding struggle, can gain the sympathy and support of the people of the world and become an invincible force.

　　Every victory of the oppressed nations all over the world in the struggle for national independence and against colonialism is a defeat for imperialism. It is very obvious that in order to maintain the interests of colonial rule, the imperialists are definitely not reconciled to this failure.

　　At present, in the Near and Middle East, American imperialism is still stubbornly pursuing the notorious "Eisenhower Doctrine," blatantly putting forward the slogan of filling the "vacuum," and attempting to establish a new American colonial system to replace the old colonial systems of Britain and France. In order to achieve this goal, recently American imperialism first carried out a series of subversive activities against Syria, and then drove Turkey to deploy troops on the Syrian border to launch a military attack on Syria. Although this new war conspiracy has been unanimously opposed by the Arab nation and peace-loving nations all over the world, its danger has not been completely eliminated so far.

　　In the Far East, American imperialism is also piecing together military blocs and openly interfering in the internal affairs of independent countries. It is undermining the Korean armistice agreement and hindering the unification of Korea. It is undermining the Indochina armistice agreement and hindering the unification of Vietnam. It is hindering the Indian people from recovering Goa. It is hindering the Indonesian people from recovering West Irian. It is establishing military bases everywhere in Japan, making Japan the outpost for its aggression against Asia. It is attempting to create "two Chinas" and hindering our people from liberating Taiwan. We resolutely oppose this series of vicious, greedy, and hateful policies of American imperialism against the Asian people. We resolutely support the Korean and Vietnamese people in unifying their own countries. We resolutely support the Indian people in recovering Goa. We resolutely support the Indonesian people in recovering West Irian. We resolutely support the Japanese people's struggle against American military bases. We resolutely oppose the American imperialists' conspiracy to create "two Chinas." We must liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan and we will never give up until we achieve our goal!

　　In Algeria, Kenya, Cameroon, Uganda, Ifni and other places in Africa, the imperialists have not put down their butcher knives, and are carrying out armed suppression and massacres in these places. The Chinese people resolutely support the just national liberation movements of the people of Algeria, Kenya, Cameroon, Uganda, and Ifni. We warn the old and new colonialists: the wheels of history cannot be reversed, and the death knell of the complete collapse of the colonial system is ringing louder and louder.

　　The Chinese people firmly believe that the struggle of the Asian and African peoples for national independence is inseparable from the struggle to defend world peace. Our struggle will be victorious in every way. Due to the increasing strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, due to the increasing development of the irreversible national independence movement, due to the great unity of all peace and democratic forces and the increasing growth of the world peace movement, and due to the increasing decline of the imperialist aggressive forces headed by American imperialism, the balance of power in the world has undergone fundamental changes. Now, the force that occupies an absolute advantage is no longer the imperialist force, but the united force of the people of socialist countries and nationally independent countries and peace-loving people all over the world. It is not the West wind prevailing over the East wind, but the East wind prevailing over the West wind. Imperialism is already the setting sun, and if they dare to play with fire in any corner of Asia and Africa, dare to play with fire on the Syrian border, their fate will be as shameful and disastrous as the invaders in Egypt, and even more so. The imperialists should remember that after the First World War, a socialist country—the Soviet Union—was born, and after the Second World War, twelve socialist countries, including China, were born; if the world is to experience a third world war, it would be the demise of the entire capitalist system! Now is the time for the warmongers of imperialism to wake up. In an era when enslaved people have awakened, in an era when artificial earth satellites and intercontinental ballistic missiles have been successfully manufactured, it is no longer an era in which war maniacs can do whatever they want.

　　The Chinese people have always resolutely opposed war and maintained peace. We firmly believe that the forces of world peace can stop war. Of course, we are also soberly aware that in the era of the so-called "button war," the danger of war carrying huge destructive disasters has not completely passed. All people who cherish peace must work together to shoulder the sacred responsibility of defending peace and stopping war. We Chinese people wholeheartedly support and fully support all proposals that are conducive to defending peace and stopping war. We Chinese people even more fully support the recent peace proposal put forward by the Soviet government: the Soviet, American, and British governments jointly undertake the obligation not to use nuclear weapons, and to stop the test explosions of various nuclear weapons from January 1, 1958. We agree that countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty should conclude a non-aggression pact, and that high-level representatives of socialist countries and capitalist countries should hold talks. These wise and practical proposals of the Soviet Union reflect the good wishes of the people all over the world.

　　The Chinese people are willing to stand with the people of Asian and African countries and appeal to the people of the world: everyone should rise up and demand that governments of all countries adopt the only rational policy of peaceful coexistence; everyone should rise up and demand an immediate cessation of the arms race, everyone should rise up and demand a ban on the production and use of all nuclear weapons, first of all, an immediate cessation of the testing of such weapons; everyone should rise up and demand an end to the policy of piecing together military blocs and establishing military bases in other countries; everyone should rise up and demand an immediate end to the "Cold War" and use peaceful negotiation methods to resolve all international disputes; everyone should rise up to end the policy of blockade and monopoly, so that cultural and economic exchanges between countries in the world are unobstructed. As long as the Asian and African people and all good people in the world unite and struggle, peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition among countries in the world can definitely be achieved, and lasting peace in the world can definitely be achieved.

　　We want to declare once again: our 600 million Chinese people fully support the convening of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference. Our delegation will soon depart for Cairo, and we must attend the meeting with this wish of our people, promote the success of the meeting, and make greater contributions to the cause of national independence and liberation of the Asian and African people; to the independent, autonomous, prosperous and strong future of the Asian and African countries, to opposing imperialist aggressive wars, and to maintaining world peace!

　　Long live the great friendship and unity of the people of Asian and African countries and peace-loving people all over the world!

　　Long live world peace!

### 加强亚非人民的团结  促进世界和平运动的发展  郭沫若在首都各界人民支持亚非团结大会会议上的讲话

　　加强亚非人民的团结  促进世界和平运动的发展
    郭沫若在首都各界人民支持亚非团结大会会议上的讲话同志们、朋友们：
    由二十一个亚非国家共同筹备的亚非团结大会从本月26日起就要在埃及的首都开罗召开了。
    大家都知道：殖民主义是战争的温床，亚非两洲是帝国主义的殖民势力范围。因此，亚非人民的觉醒和团结正是从根本上来消灭殖民主义、消灭战争。因此，这次会议正是保卫世界和平的一次盛大的集会。
    这次会议已经向亚非地区的四十多个国家和地方的人民发出了邀请，它具有广泛的代表性。在会议上将就保卫世界和平和许多与亚非地区切身利益有关的重大问题交换意见。可以预期，这次的会议将有利于进一步加强亚非人民的团结和友谊，将有利于进一步推动亚非人民反对殖民主义和争取民族独立的正义斗争，将有利于促进世界和平运动的发展。
    今天，我们首都各界人民的代表在这里举行大会，我们要向世界人民庄严地宣告：我们中国六亿人民衷心地支持这次大会的召开，热烈地预祝这次大会的成功！
    这次大会是在世界局势有利于和平力量，而不利于战争势力的时机召开的。觉醒了的亚非人民始终是和平的积极的维护者。1952年在北京召开了亚细亚和太平洋区域和平会议。1955年在德里召开了亚洲团结大会。1955年以来，在日本连续三次举行了反对核武器的国际大会。1957年在科伦坡举行了世界和平理事会。在这之外，各国都广泛展开了反对核武器的运动，对埃及和叙利亚人民维护和平反对侵略的斗争更特别表示了热烈的支持。这些都一再地反映着觉醒了的亚非人民保卫世界和平的强烈愿望。
    第二次世界大战以后，觉醒了的亚非人民争取民族解放、维护民族独立、反对殖民主义的斗争已经大大地动摇了帝国主义的殖民制度。特别是1955年4月间，在印度尼西亚的美丽城市万隆举行的亚非会议，标志着亚非人民在反殖民主义的基础上的团结一致；产生了万隆精神，不仅有助于亚非国家的解放，并有助于全世界被压迫民族的解放。殖民主义者任意进行剥削和奴役的时代已经一去不复返了。
    我们中国人民过去的命运和亚非地区的许多国家的命运是共同的。我们长期遭受着帝国主义的侵略和殖民主义的奴役。直到现在，美帝国主义者还敌视和威胁着我们，侵占着我国的领土台湾。因此，我国人民在庆幸我们已经走上了社会主义的康庄大道的时候，就特别关注着亚非各国人民和全世界被压迫民族争取民族解放和维护民族独立的斗争。我们为一切已经获得民族独立的国家和人民的胜利欢呼。我们支持一切正在高举着要求独立自由的旗帜而进行英勇斗争的国家和人民。我们毫不踌蹰地支持一切为维护自己国家的独立主权而抗击帝国主义侵略的正义行动。
    我们很高兴地看到，会议的东道主——埃及人民是站在反帝斗争的最前线。去年，他们抗击英、法、以色列的共同侵略所得到的胜利，是过去一年来在反对殖民主义、维护民族独立和保卫世界和平的斗争中所取得的一个意义重大的胜利。这个胜利证明了帝国主义者企图以武装镇压来维持和恢复殖民统治，实行侵略战争的政策是行不通的。这个胜利也证明了，任何一个被压迫的民族只要把命运掌握在自己手里，高举起民族独立的旗帜，进行坚决不屈的斗争，就能够得到全世界人民的同情和支持，而成为不可战胜的力量。
    全世界被压迫民族在争取民族独立和反对殖民主义的斗争中的每一个胜利就是帝国主义的失败。帝国主义者为了维持殖民统治的利益，非常明显，他们是决不甘心于这种失败的。
    目前，在中近东，美帝国主义还在顽强地推行着臭名远扬的“艾森豪威尔主义”，明目张胆地提出填补“真空”的口号，企图建立美国的新殖民制度来代替英、法的旧殖民制度。为了达到这个目的，最近时期美帝国主义始而对叙利亚进行了一连串的颠覆活动，继而又驱使土耳其陈兵叙利亚边境，要向叙利亚发动军事进攻。这一新战争阴谋虽然遭受到阿拉伯民族和全世界爱好和平的民族的一致反对，但到目前为止，仍然没有彻底解除它的危险。
    在远东，美帝国主义同样地还在拼凑军事集团，公开干涉独立国家的内政。它破坏朝鲜停战协定，阻挠朝鲜的统一。它破坏印度支那停战协定，阻挠越南的统一。它阻挠印度人民收回果阿。它阻挠印度尼西亚人民收回西伊里安。它在日本到处建立军事基地，使日本成为他的侵略亚洲的前站。它企图制造“两个中国”，阻挠我国人民解放台湾。美帝国主义这一系列的凶恶、贪婪和仇恨亚洲人民的政策，我们是坚决地反对的。我们坚决支持朝鲜和越南人民统一自己的祖国。我们坚决支持印度人民收回果阿。我们坚决支持印度尼西亚人民收复西伊里安。我们坚决支持日本人民反对美国军事基地的斗争。我们坚决反对美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋。我们一定要解放我国的神圣领土台湾，不达目的，决不罢休！
    在非洲的阿尔及利亚、怯尼亚、喀麦隆、乌干达、伊夫尼等地方，帝国主义者也并没有放下他们的屠刀，正在这些地方实行武力镇压和屠杀。我们中国人民坚决支持阿尔及利亚、怯尼亚、喀麦隆、乌干达和伊夫尼人民的正义的民族解放运动。我们告诫新旧殖民主义者：历史车轮是无法扭转的，殖民体系全部崩溃的丧钟已经越敲越响了。
    中国人民坚决相信，亚非人民为争取民族独立而进行的斗争和保卫世界和平的斗争是分不开的。我们的斗争将无往而不胜利。由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的日益强大，由于不可阻遏的民族独立运动的日益发展，由于一切和平民主力量的大团结和世界和平运动的日益壮大，并由于以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义侵略势力的日益衰退，世界的力量对比已经起了根本的变化。现在占着绝对优势的已不再是帝国主义力量，而是社会主义国家和民族独立国家的人民和全世界爱好和平人民的团结力量了。不是西风压倒东风，而是东风压倒西风了。帝国主义已经是快要落山的太阳，他们如果敢于在亚非地区任何一个角落玩火，敢于在叙利亚边境玩火，他们的命运将和在埃及的侵略者一样遭受到可耻的惨败，而且还要更惨。帝国主义者应该记着，在第一次世界大战后产生了一个社会主义国家——苏联，在第二次世界大战后产生了包含中国在内的十二个社会主义国家；如果世界还要经历第三次大战，那就是整个资本主义体系的灭亡！目前应该是帝国主义的好战分子们清醒一下的时候了。在被奴役的人民已经觉醒了的时代，在人造地球卫星和洲际弹道火箭已经制造成功的时代，已经不再是战争狂人们为所欲为的时代了。
    我们中国人民是一贯坚决地反对战争、维护和平的。我们坚决相信世界和平力量能够阻止战争。当然，我们也清醒地看到，在所谓“按纽战争”的时代带着巨大毁灭性灾祸的战争危险并没有完全过去。一切珍视和平的人们还必须一致努力，担负起保卫和平、制止战争的神圣职责。对于一切有利于保卫和平、制止战争的主张，我们中国人民是衷心拥护和全力支持的。我们中国人民更完全支持苏联政府最近提出的和平建议：苏、美、英三国政府共同承担不使用核武器的义务，并且从1958年1月1日起停止各种核武器的试验爆炸。我们赞成参加北大西洋组织和华沙条约的国家缔结互不侵犯协定，社会主义国家和资本主义国家的高级代表举行会谈。苏联的这些明智的切实的建议，反映了全世界人民的善良愿望。
    我们中国人民愿意和亚非各国人民站在一起，向全世界人民呼吁：大家起来要求各国政府采取和平共处的唯一的理智的政策；大家起来要求立即停止军备竞赛，大家起来要求禁止生产和使用一切核武器，首先是立即停止试验这种武器；大家起来要求停止进行拼凑军事集团和在其他国家建立军事基地的政策；大家起来要求立即结束“冷战”，用和平协商的方法来解决一切国际争端；大家起来结束封锁垄断的政策，使世界各国的文化交流与经济交流畅通无阻。只要亚非人民和全世界一切善良的人们团结起来进行斗争，世界各国的和平共处和和平竞赛是一定能够实现的，全世界的持久和平是一定能够实现的。
    我们要再一次宣告：我们中国六亿人民全力支持亚非团结大会的召开。我国的代表团不久就要动身去开罗了，我们一定要带着我国人民的这种愿望去出席会议，促使会议获得成功，为亚非各国人民的民族独立解放事业；为亚非各国的独立自主的、繁荣昌盛的前途，为反对帝国主义的侵略战争，为维护世界和平作出更大的贡献！
    亚非各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的友好大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
