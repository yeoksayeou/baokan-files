Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 13th: The Southwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau has confirmed that the coal reserves in western Guizhou rank first in the Southwest region.

In the vast area west of Guiyang, Guizhou, extending east from Anshun to Panxian, and north from Shuicheng to Zhenfeng, there are seven interconnected large coalfields, collectively known as the Qianxi Great Coalfield. The total reserves of mineable coal seams above 500 meters from the ground in the Qianxi Great Coalfield reach more than 18 billion tons, which is more than 8 billion tons more than the total reserves of Sichuan Province. This is a tremendous achievement made by the Southwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau and the Guizhou Provincial Geological Bureau, which successively dispatched topographic surveying teams and geological teams for diligent work last year and this year.

Before liberation, Guizhou Province was known as a poor and remote place where "the sky is not clear for three days, and the land is not flat for three miles"; reactionary geologists even added "coal is not three feet thick" to describe the lack of coal mines in Guizhou Province. However, this year, the Southwest Coalfield geological explorers have proved that the Qianxi Coalfield has many layers, large thickness, and each layer has a thickness of six to ten meters.

The Qianxi Coalfield is not only rich in reserves, but also has a complete variety of coal types, with very little sulfur content, making it more suitable for coking coal than the high-sulfur coal in Sichuan and Yunnan. Due to the discovery of the Qianxi Great Coalfield, not only is there a reliable coal base for the development of large iron mines such as Panzhihua and western Hubei, but it can also meet the coal needs of coal-deficient and coal-scarce provinces such as Sichuan and Guangxi.

　　贵州西部发现大煤田
    攀枝花、鄂西等铁矿有了可靠的煤源
    据新华社重庆13日电　西南煤田地质勘探局已经证实贵州西部煤的蕴藏占西南区第一位。
    贵州贵阳以西，东起安顺西到盘县，北从水城南到贞丰的大片土地上，分布着七个互相毗连的大煤田，总称为黔西大煤田。黔西大煤田离地面五百公尺以上的可采煤层，总储量达一百八十多亿吨，比四川全省总储量还多八十多亿吨。这是西南煤田地质勘探局和贵州省地质局，在去年和今年先后派遣地形测量队和地质队辛勤工作所获得的巨大成果。
    贵州省解放前被称为“天无三日晴、地无三里平”的穷乡僻壤；反动的地质学家还加一句“煤无三尺厚”，来形容贵州省煤矿贫乏。但是今年西南煤田地质勘探工作者已经证明，黔西煤田层数多、厚度大，每层厚度有六到十公尺。
    黔西煤田不但储量丰富，而且煤种齐全，硫分很少，比四川、云南的高硫煤更适宜作炼焦煤用。由于黔西大煤田的发现，不但开发攀枝花、鄂西等大铁矿有了可靠的煤炭基地，而且可以满足四川、广西等缺煤、少煤省份的用煤需要。
