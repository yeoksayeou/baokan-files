    How to Conduct a Great Debate Among Street Residents
    By our reporter Yi Qin
    How can we conduct a great socialist debate among street residents according to their characteristics? The Dongsi District People's Committee of Beijing has gained valuable experience in its pilot work.
    Dongsi District started a pilot project for the great socialist debate in the Huizhaosi Residents' Committee of the Wacha Hutong subdistrict and the Xilangxia Residents' Committee of the Weijia Hutong subdistrict in late August. Over the past few months, through extensive airing of views, debates, and contentions, the socialist consciousness of the residents has been greatly enhanced. They have generally realized the principles that "improvement of life must be subordinate to the development of production" and "individual interests must be subordinate to collective interests." They have further established the ideology of building the country and managing households through diligence and frugality. Many people who used to complain about tight food supplies now voluntarily propose saving food. Many people who complained about the shortage of commodity supplies no longer complain.
    In conducting a great socialist debate among street residents, who exactly should we rely on? This was the first question in the pilot work of Dongsi District. Like all work, street debates must first rely on activists, because activists live among the masses and are familiar with their thoughts, feelings, and demands. However, what kind of person is a true activist? At the beginning, some cadres of the work group had some wrong ideas about this issue. They believed that "debates rely on mouths, and we must rely on those who are eloquent." Therefore, some places regarded capitalists and former security team leaders who had not been reformed as activists. However, these people verbally supported socialism but opposed the Communist Party and socialism at heart. In the Xilangxia Residents' Committee, one committee member was a capitalist who transported grain and embezzled grain coupons, but some cadres of the work group asked him to lead the great grain debate. How could the debate be successful?
    So, in the street debate, who should we rely on? We should rely on urban residents who have been politically and economically emancipated. Among these people, many may not be eloquent due to their limited education, but once their class consciousness is awakened, they can distinguish between right and wrong and actively lead the masses in airing their views and engaging in contention. Guo Deyuan, No. 15 Huizhaosi Side Gate, was so poor before liberation that he could not afford to eat and lived on borrowed money. Once, he borrowed money to buy mixed flour, but the money was snatched away by Kuomintang soldiers. At that time, the police not only did not protect him but also beat him up. Li Shulan, who came from a poor peasant family in the countryside, also had nothing to eat before liberation. Now, she can eat rationed rice and white flour every month. The work group relied closely on these people. These people were not only able to refute various erroneous remarks in the debate but also actively put forward their opinions on the government's work. Guo Deyuan had a family of three. In the debate, through recollection and comparison, he explained that the people's livelihood was guaranteed because the Communist Party came and implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and the planned supply of commodities. During the extensive airing of views, Guo Deyuan tried every means to conduct individual visits to residents' homes day and night, trying to eliminate the ideological concerns of the masses, and many residents actively participated in the airing of views. Not only that, Guo Deyuan's wife, under his influence, also became a backbone force. When saving food, she also visited households to help everyone calculate four accounts: 1. waste account; 2. guest food consumption account; 3. actual food consumption account; and 4. surplus food account and food saving account. After her help, many people found that they could save four or five jin of grain instead of two or three jin.
    Relying on urban residents who have been politically and economically emancipated does not mean that everything should be handled by these people alone. To carry out the great debate, we must also rely on the vast majority of residents. The situation of urban residents is more complicated. The vast majority of people support socialism, but there are also a very small number of bad elements who deliberately sabotage the great debate. Therefore, we must do a good job in winning over the vast majority of people. The Sixth Residents Group of Huizhaosi did a better job in this regard. When organizing and training the debate team, this group paid attention to absorbing middle-of-the-road masses to participate. The middle-of-the-road masses were educated, their consciousness was raised, and they actively participated in the debate. Granny Zhang and Mrs. Zhao are such people. At the airing of views meeting, someone said: "What's the big deal about raising a few chickens and eating some grain!" Mrs. Zhao calculated an account: she raised a few chickens herself, which consumed 18 jin of grain a year. If 100 families raised chickens like her, they would consume 1,800 jin of grain a year. She said: "Who says it's nothing to eat a little grain for chickens? A little for one family, a lot for ten families, which is not good for individuals or the country." The next day, she sent two chickens out of the city. The three families in her courtyard who raised chickens also sent them away.
    While fully mobilizing the masses, we should also correctly give play to the role of government cadres and workers. Some people in Huizhaosi were afraid to speak at the airing of views meetings. A worker vividly introduced the situation of the extensive airing of views in the factory, encouraging everyone to air their views. The masses said: It turns out that any opinions can be expressed, so let's talk about it! Some government cadres actively inspired and guided their families to air their views after returning home, which played a great role.
    In the debate, we must try every means to eliminate everyone's ideological concerns and encourage everyone to speak their minds. This is another issue in the pilot work of Dongsi District. At the beginning of the airing of views, some people believed that there was no end to talking about the benefits of the Communist Party, and wouldn't raising any more opinions be picking on things? Some people said: "After liberation, we are well-fed and well-clothed, what else do people want?" Some people had opinions but dared not speak.
    In response to the above situation, the work group adopted a variety of methods to eliminate the residents' ideological concerns. First, the work group and the subdistrict office came forward to clarify that the purpose of the great debate was to improve socialist consciousness, enhance unity, and improve work. Then, the work group went deep into the families for visits and individual talks, conducting persuasive education based on each person's specific circumstances. In this way, some people dared to speak. A person surnamed Hou in Xilangxia originally didn't say anything. After persuasive education, he raised three opinions.
    Even after the mobilization of the conference and individual visits, there were still a few people who were unwilling to speak. This was mainly because some housewives, first, were not used to speaking in front of many people; second, they were tied up by housework. If the meeting lasted too long, they would worry about "my husband is about to get off work, I have to cook!" or "the child is about to wake up!" and they would not be in the mood to speak. In response to this situation, the pilot work in Dongsi District paid attention to improving the form of airing of views. The original large-scale forums were changed to courtyard forums. The number of people in this type of forum did not exceed ten, the time was short, it was close to home, it did not hinder housework, and if the child cried, they could go back and bring it back to the meeting. At the same time, the people participating in the meeting knew each other, and it was convenient to speak. At the beginning of the airing of views in the Xilangxia Residents' Committee, large-scale forums were held, and very few people spoke. After repeated mobilization, many people still did not speak. Later, small forums were held like this, and everyone scrambled to speak, some people speaking two or three times. For those who were still unwilling to speak at the small forums, they adopted the method of individual visits. Fang Yuzhen in Xilangxia was unwilling to talk about her opinions on the street security work, but later she talked about it in an individual visit.
    Some people say that using too many courtyard forums and individual visits cannot allow opinions to be communicated, and there cannot be mutual enlightenment. The pilot work in Dongsi District took the method of compiling and distributing mimeographed newsletters to make up for this shortcoming. The mimeographed newsletter promptly introduced the important opinions raised at the various courtyard forums to everyone. Once, the newsletter published that someone in Xilangxia proposed that some people who were not engaged in proper business were pulling people into gambling on the streets, which had a bad influence. Some residents in other groups saw this and proposed that they also had this situation.
    In addition, conscientiously implementing the spirit of rectifying and reforming while rectifying is also an effective way to eliminate the concerns of the masses and promote the airing of views. The residents of the two pilot residents' committees in Dongsi District put forward 824 opinions, involving commodity supply, the work style of store staff, urban employment, and other aspects. The district people's committee promptly studied these opinions one by one and dealt with them according to the specific conditions and the urgency. In particular, it seized the opportunity to solve the problems that the masses urgently demanded, the opinions were relatively concentrated, and the current conditions could be resolved. For example, many residents in Xilangxia proposed that there were two coal shops near this alley, and the scope of supply by district was not clear enough. The two coal shops pushed each other away, and some households had not received machine-made coal briquettes for two months. After this problem was raised, the district store of the Coal Construction Company dealt with it within three days. According to the opinions of the masses, the District Non-Staple Food Retail Management Office convened a meeting of relevant business personnel, conducted education, and improved its work. The masses said: It is really useful to put forward opinions, and the people are really the masters of the house. They continued to put forward 427 opinions.
    In the street debate, we should first inspire and improve the residents' class consciousness through new and old recollection comparisons, and on the basis of improving class consciousness, we should continue to educate them that the interests of each family must be subordinate to the overall interests. This is another issue in the pilot work of Dongsi District. Generally, street residents have participated in the "Three-Anti," "Five-Anti," suppression of counter-revolutionaries, resistance to the US and aid to Korea, and other movements in the past, and their ideological awareness has been significantly improved. However, because many housewives have not personally participated in class struggle like workers and farmers, they must first improve their class consciousness in this movement. Some residents' groups in Xilangxia began by debating whether the grain supplied by the state was enough to eat? Is unified purchase and sale convenient? The masses said: People's stomachs are big and small, and there is no way to discuss it. After the work group's research, it was decided to discuss it through the method of comparing the new and the old. They asked: How much grain did you eat before liberation? How much grain do you eat after liberation? Was it convenient to buy grain before liberation? Or is it convenient after liberation? As soon as this was mentioned, everyone started debating. Li Fengying said: "Before liberation, my father worked hard to grow vegetables and sell them for some money. When the money was deposited in the bank, it could buy seven bags of flour. When it was taken out a few days later, it could only buy 70 jin of flour. My father was so angry that he cried holding the bag of flour. After liberation, especially after the unified purchase and sale of grain, prices have stabilized. Whenever I have money, I can buy grain. It's really the greatest convenience." More people said: "Before liberation, it was convenient for some people, that is, capitalists and landlords. They had money and power, and they sat at home. With a phone call, the grain was delivered to their home. But what about the poor? They simply had no money to buy grain, and sometimes they couldn't buy grain even if they had money." After everyone clarified this issue, they were guided to: Since the unified purchase and sale of grain is the greatest convenience for the working people, then how should we help the government implement the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain? This is actually to carry out the education of "improvement of life must be subordinate to the development of production" and "individual interests must be subordinate to the overall interests." After recollection and comparison, the Sixth Residents Group of Huizhaosi, based on the opinions put forward by the masses in the airing of views: "Anyway, the grain is bought with my money. It is more convenient to store it in my own 'small warehouse' than in the state's large warehouse," they proposed: Is it better to store it in a large warehouse? Or is it better to store it in a small warehouse? Chen Qu said vividly: Let me compare it with my own family: My family of four has a son and a daughter-in-law. If the daughters-in-law all have selfish intentions towards me and put some money in their pockets, I, the old woman, will have no way to manage the family. Our country is like a large family made up of many small families. The government is like a head of household. If every small family has some selfish intentions towards the government, how can our government lead the people to build socialism!

    如何在街道居民中开展大辩论
    本报记者　宜勤
    如何根据街道居民特点，在他们中间开展社会主义大辩论？北京市东四区人民委员会在试点工作中取得了宝贵的经验。
    东四区从8月下旬即已在瓦岔胡同办事处慧照寺居民委员会和魏家胡同办事处西廊下居民委员会开始社会主义大辩论的试点工作，几个月来，经过大鸣大放大争，居民社会主义觉悟大大提高，普遍认识到“生活的改善必须服从于生产的发展”“个人利益必须服从于集体利益”的道理，进一步树立了勤俭建国勤俭持家的思想，许多过去叫嚷粮食偏紧的人自动提出节约粮食。许多埋怨商品供应紧张的人现在不再埋怨了。
    在街道居民当中，开展社会主义大辩论，究竟依靠什么人？这是东四区街道试点工作中的第一个问题。街道辩论和一切工作一样，首先要依靠积极分子，因为积极分子生活在群众当中，熟悉群众的思想、感情和要求，但是什么样的人才算是真正的积极分子？开始时，工作组部分干部对这个问题曾存在一些错误看法，他们认为：“辩论，就是要靠嘴巴，要依靠能说会道的”。因此，有些地方把没有经过改造的资本家、伪保安队队长都当作了积极分子。但是，这些人口头上拥护社会主义，骨子里反对共产党反对社会主义。西廊下居民委员会中有个委员是资本家，外运粮食，侵吞粮票，可是工作组有的干部却叫他去领导粮食大辩论。辩论会怎么能开的好呢？
    那么，在街道大辩论中，究竟应该依靠什么样的人呢？应该依靠政治上、经济上翻身的城市居民，在这些人当中，许多人由于文化水平限制，不一定能说会道，但是，一经启发了他们的阶级觉悟以后，他们便能分清大是大非，积极领导群众大鸣大放和大争。慧照寺侧门十五号郭德元，在解放前，穷得吃不上饭，借债度日，有一次借了钱去买混合面，钱被国民党大兵抢去，当时警察不但不出来保护，反而把郭德元打了一顿。农村贫农出身的李淑兰，解放前，也是个没饭吃的人，现在每月都能吃到定量供应的大米、白面。工作组紧紧依靠这些人。这些人不仅在辩论会上能够据理驳斥种种错误的言论，而且积极地对政府工作提出自己的意见。郭德元一家有三人，在辩论会上，通过回忆对比，说明：共产党来了，实行了粮食统购统销政策，实行了商品计划供应，劳动人民生活就有了保障。大鸣大放中，郭德元想尽各种办法，不分白天黑夜到居民家中进行个别访问，设法消除群众思想顾虑，许多居民也就积极参加大鸣大放。不仅如此，郭德元的爱人，在郭德元带动下，也成为一个骨干力量，在节约粮食时，她也挨户访问，帮助大家算清四笔账：一、浪费账；二、客人吃粮食的账；三、实际用粮账；四、余粮账和节约粮食账。许多人经她帮助一算，原来节约二斤、三斤的，可以节约四斤、五斤了。
    所谓依靠政治上、经济上翻身的城市居民，并不等于说一切事情就都由这些人包办起来，要开展大辩论，还得要依靠居民中的绝大多数。城市居民情况比较复杂，绝大多数人是拥护社会主义的，但是，也还有极少数坏分子，蓄意破坏大辩论。因此一定要做好争取绝大多数人的工作。慧照寺第六居民小组对这个工作做的较好。这个小组在组织训练辩论队伍时，注意吸收中间群众参加，中间群众受到教育，提高了觉悟，积极地参加辩论。张老太太、赵太太就是这样的人，在鸣放会上，曾有人说：“养几只鸡，吃点粮食，有什么了不起！”赵老太太就给算了一笔账：她自己养了几只鸡，一年要吃十八斤粮食，如果有一百家像她这样养鸡，一年就要吃一千八百斤粮食，一千八百斤粮食，可供五个妇女吃一年。她说：“谁说鸡吃点粮食没有什么了不起，一家不多，十家就多了，对个人对国家都没有好处。”第二天，她就把两只鸡送到城外去了，她院里有三户养鸡的也都把鸡送走了。
    在充分发动群众的同时，还应该正确发挥机关干部、职工的作用。慧照寺有些人在鸣、放会上不敢发言，有一个工人就在会上生动地介绍了工厂大鸣大放的情况，鼓励大家鸣放。群众说：原来什么意见都可以说，咱们就说说吧！有些机关干部回家后，积极启发、引导家属鸣放，起了很大作用。
    在辩论中，要想尽一切办法，消除大家思想顾虑，鼓励大家把心里话说出来，这是东四区街道试点工作中的另一个问题。在鸣放开始的时候，有些人认为共产党的好处说不完，再提什么意见，不是鸡蛋里挑骨头吗？有人说：“解放以后，吃饱穿暖，还叫人家怎么啦。”有些人有意见，但是不敢讲。
    针对以上情况，工作组采取了多种多样的办法来消除居民的思想顾虑，首先由工作组、办事处出面说清楚大辩论的目的是为了提高社会主义觉悟，增强团结，改进工作。接着，工作组又深入家庭访问，个别谈心，针对各人具体情况进行说服教育。这样有些人敢于说话了，西廊下有一个姓侯的，原来什么话也不说，经过说服教育后，就提了三条意见。
    即使经过大会动员，个别访问，仍有少数人不愿说话。这主要是有少数家庭妇女，第一，她们不习惯在许多人面前讲话；第二，为家务劳动的牵连，开会时间一长，就惦念起“丈夫快下班了，要烧饭了！”、“孩子睡觉要醒来了！”也就没心思说话。针对这一情况，东四区试点工作中注意改进鸣放形式。由原来召开大型座谈会改变成召开院落座谈会，这种座谈会的人数不超过十人，时间短，离家近，不妨碍家务劳动，孩子哭了，还可以回去抱来再开会，同时，参加会议的人都互相了解，说话方便。西廊下居民委员会，在鸣放开始时，是开大型的座谈会，发言人数寥寥无几，一再动员，许多人仍不讲话，后来开这样的小型座谈会，个个争先恐后发言，有些人发言两三次。对于个别在小型座谈会上仍不愿发言的人，他们又采取个别访问的办法，西廊下方玉珍对街道治安工作的意见怎么也不肯说，后来在个别访问中谈出来了。
    有人说：过多采用院落座谈会及个别访问的形式，意见不能通气，相互间不能有所启发，东四区试点工作中是采取编发油印小报的办法来弥补这个缺陷。油印小报把各个院落座谈会上所提出来的重要意见，及时介绍给大家。一次小报上登着西廊下有人提出：有些不务正业的人，在街道上拉人赌博，影响不好。别的组有的居民看到了，就提出他们那里也有这种情况。
    另外，在鸣放中认真贯彻边整边改精神，也是消除群众顾虑推动群众鸣放的有效方法。东四区两个试点居民委员会的居民，在鸣放中提出了八百二十四条意见，涉及商品供应、商店工作人员作风，城市就业等等各方面的问题，区人民委员会对于这些意见及时逐件进行了研究，根据具体条件和轻重缓急作了处理，特别是抓紧解决群众要求比较迫切，意见比较集中和目前有条件解决的问题。如西廊下许多居民提出：这条胡同附近有两家煤铺，划片供应的范围不够明确，两家煤铺互推，有些户已经两个月没有得到机制煤球。这个问题提出以后，煤建公司区店在三天之内就作了处理。区副食品零售管理处根据群众的意见，召开了有关业务人员的会议，进行了教育，改进了工作。群众说：提意见真管事，真是人民当家做了主。又继续提出了四百二十七条意见。
    在街道辩论中，应该首先通过新、旧回忆对比，启发、提高居民的阶级觉悟，在阶级觉悟提高的基础上，再继续进行本家本户利益必须服从整体利益的教育。这是东四区街道试点工作中的又一个问题。一般街道居民过去都参加了“三反”、“五反”、镇压反革命、抗美援朝等运动，思想觉悟有显著提高，但是，由于许多家庭妇女没有像工人、农民那样亲身参加阶级斗争，因此，在这次运动中还必须首先提高阶级觉悟。西廊下有些居民小组一开始就辩论国家供应的粮食够不够吃？统购统销方便不方便？群众说：人的肚子有大有小，没有办法讨论。经过工作组研究后，决定通过新旧对比方法来讨论。提出：解放前吃多少粮食？解放后吃多少粮食？解放前买粮食方便？还是解放后方便？这样一提，大家就辩论开了。李凤英说：“解放前，我父亲辛辛苦苦种菜卖点钱，钱存银行时，能买七袋面粉，不几天拿出来时，只能买到七十斤面粉，父亲气得抱着面袋哭。解放以后，特别是粮食统购统销以后，物价稳定了，什么时候有钱，什么时候去买粮食，真是最大的方便”。更多的人说：“解放前，对有些人是方便，那就是资本家、地主，他们有钱有势，坐在家里，电话一打，粮食就送到家里了，可是穷人呢？根本没钱买粮食，有时候有钱也买不到粮食。”在大家明确这个问题以后，再引导到：既然粮食统购统销对劳动人民是最大的方便，那么，究竟应该怎样帮助政府贯彻粮食统购统销政策？这实际上也就是进行“生活改善必须服从于生产的发展”、“个人利益必须服从于整体利益”的教育。慧照寺第六居民小组在经过回忆、对比以后，根据群众在鸣、放中提出来的：“粮食反正是我拿钱买的，存在自己的
  ‘小仓库’里总比存在国家的大仓库里要方便些”的意见，提出：究竟存在大仓库好？还是存在小仓库好？陈曲氏生动地说：拿我自己的家庭来比：我一家四口，有儿子、儿媳，如果儿媳们对我都存私心，口袋里都装一点钱，我这个老太太就没有法子当家过日子了。咱们国家就好像许多小家庭合起来的大家庭，政府好比是个当家人，如果每个小家庭都对政府存点私心，咱们的政府怎么领导人民建设社会主义！
