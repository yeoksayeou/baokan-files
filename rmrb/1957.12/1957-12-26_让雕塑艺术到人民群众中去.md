    Let Sculpture Art Go to the People
    Hua Tianyou
    Speaking of sculpture, many people still don't understand it very well, and it doesn't seem very familiar. In fact, as far back as when humans lived primitive lives, there were already people who could carve wooden figures and sculpt clay figures. With the development of human society, sculpture, like other cultural and artistic departments, has also been continuously developing. Sculpture is often the most prominent and visible symbol of the cultural and artistic level of a certain society or period. We can even say that any period in history when sculpture was most prosperous must have been the period when culture was most developed. Any ancient civilization with a long history has left behind many great sculptural artistic heritages. For example, the Sphinx of Egypt, the five-legged bull-bodied human-headed statue of Babylon, the temple decorations of the Parthenon in ancient Greece, the statues of Roman emperors, and the Ajanta Grottoes of India are all world-famous. The grottoes and huge Buddha statues at Yungang, Longmen, and Tianlongshan in China are also well known. However, in modern times, in the increasingly decadent and declining capitalist countries and the oppressed and invaded colonial countries, sculpture art could not be developed, and China, in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal state for the past century, naturally only saw its sculpture art decline. Only after the national liberation did we have the conditions and possibilities to develop sculpture art. On the day before the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao personally broke ground to lay the foundation for the Monument to the People's Heroes in the capital, which was also the commencement ceremony for sculptors to serve New China and socialism. Sculptors across the country cheered in unison!
    But what is the function of sculpture? There are still many people who do not understand. Speaking of its function, I will not talk about how slave owners, feudal emperors, and religious popes used sculpture to promote, flaunt, and enhance their prestige. That is a thing of the past. Here, I will talk about this year's National Agricultural Exhibition. As soon as we enter the exhibition hall, don't we see a tall statue of the "Worker-Peasant Alliance"? Regardless of whether this work is good or bad, the concrete image of this sculptural artwork immediately makes people feel that this is an exhibition of the fruits of labor of our laborers. Coupled with the large-scale murals decorating the four walls, which depict the pleasant and happy atmosphere of farmers, herdsmen, and fishermen, this strongly demonstrates the entire spirit of the exhibition. When the audience steps into the venue, they first gain a deep and general impression and feel refreshed and lovely about the exhibition. This is the function of sculpture. However, sculpture is not only used in exhibitions. The role played by sculptures in such exhibitions is not significant. If they are moved to enterprises, rural areas, and other practical production departments, then their role in inspiring the people will be greater and more direct. If a large city can erect sculptures in the most important places, then the spiritual outlook of this city can also be expressed through sculpture. The soon-to-be-completed Monument to the People's Heroes in the capital has eight large-scale relief sculptures on its Sumeru pedestal depicting the immortal deeds of revolutionary martyrs. At a glance, people can think of the martyrs' spirit of selfless struggle and arouse boundless patriotic enthusiasm, which is of great significance. What is felt to be insufficient now is that such a huge Monument to the People's Heroes is built in such an important place directly facing Tiananmen Square, but only its Sumeru pedestal has reliefs. From a distance, people can only see a tall stone monument and cannot see the reliefs, which means that the monument has not fully utilized and further exerted the role of sculpture. To be more specific, since the base of the monument has reliefs, the body of the monument should also have round sculptures. If a huge and heroic image of the Chinese people standing up is placed on the monument, then the monument will be even more meaningful. At the same time, the entire city of our capital will be enhanced. It can not only vividly express the immortal spirit of struggle of the martyrs but also make the people feel proud and motivated in front of the monument.
    Not long ago, I had the opportunity to see the design drawings of Beijing's urban plan, which only used large and small roads to form circles and circles. This is not enough because this design only takes roads as the central content and arranges them into a planar pattern. Only when sitting on an airplane can you see the beauty of this city. But when people walk through it, they can only see one road on the left and one road on the right, which is ultimately dull and tasteless, and you can't see any beauty. If the major squares of Beijing can be beautified with sculptures, and the roads are led to various squares, so that each center is organized into a scattered radiation network, then all the roads can see different beautiful central constructions, and the city can be truly beautified. In various parks and cultural palaces of the working people, sculptural images of revolutionary martyrs, cultural celebrities, laborers, and athletes can also be arranged. Sculpture should also be applied to important buildings and projects such as hydroelectric power stations and bridges, giving these buildings and construction projects character and life. In addition, sculptures can also be placed in seaports and harbors, etc. In short, let sculpture art appear among the people in an active posture, so as to exert a more positive and greater role than in the old era. Of course, I am not asking for "everything to be rebuilt," nor am I asking to make all the sculpture work very ideal all at once. This is impossible. However, if the relevant parties still do not pay attention to sculpture and do not include it in the construction plan in order to achieve it step by step with emphasis, then in the near future, it will cause irreparable defects and errors in cultural construction.
    What is the current situation? Since the government called for streamlining and saving for the sake of building socialism, the construction department has first saved cultural construction, especially sculpture. The Tianjin Gymnasium had ordered a batch of sculptures from a sculpture factory, paid for them, and completed the works, but finally canceled their use for fear of criticism. The reason why Beijing's urban planning design only uses large and small roads as the central content of urban composition is said to be because cultural construction was saved. There are many such examples. Some practical problems facing sculpture art should be resolved quickly. The Ministry of Culture should convene a certain meeting to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth study on the current problems, and truly evaluate this art of sculpture. Is sculpture a luxury? Is it a waste? Will sculpture play an active role? In addition to wearable, small, easel-based, and decorative items, should sculpture be given an appropriate position in urban construction?
    I suggest that after affirming the effect of the art of sculpture, it is best to strengthen the sculpture department accordingly and make a cultural construction plan under the premise of adapting to the characteristics of Chinese cities. Not only should there be planned leadership in construction, but there should also be planned publicity and arrangement, so that the task of cultural construction can be truly completed. Otherwise, in the future, when people's cultural level improves and they demand the reconstruction of those ugly and meaningless constructions, it will be a greater waste.
    I also suggest that because the design personnel of our country's construction departments still lack comprehensive experience in cultural construction, it is best to establish an architecture department in the Central Academy of Fine Arts, so that architects, sculptors, and painters can develop a habit of good cooperation from the beginning, in order to jointly build perfect art and architecture that plays an active role for socialist construction.

    让雕塑艺术到人民群众中去
    滑田友
    谈到雕塑艺术，许多人都还不大了解，好像也还不大习惯。实际上，远在人类过着原始生活的时候，就有人会雕木人和塑泥人了。随着人类社会的发展，雕塑同其他文化艺术各部门一样，也在不断的发展，而雕塑，往往是某一社会某一时期的文化艺术水平最突出显见的标志，我们甚至可以这样说，凡是历史上雕塑艺术最繁荣的时期，一定就是文化最发达的时期。任何历史久远的文明古国，没有不留下许多伟大的雕塑艺术遗产的。例如埃及的狮身人首像，巴比伦的五足牛身人首像，古希腊的巴尔代隆的神殿装饰，罗马的帝王像，以及印度的阿旃陀石窟等等，都是举世闻名的。中国的云岗、龙门、天龙山等处的石窟和巨大的佛像，也是尽人皆知的。不过，到了近代，在日趋腐朽没落的资本主义国家和被压迫被侵略的殖民地国家，雕塑艺术不用说是发展不起来的，而我们中国近百年来，处在半殖民地半封建的状况下，雕塑艺术自然也只有衰退而已。直到全国解放以后，我们才有了发展雕塑艺术的条件和可能。在中华人民共和国成立的前一天，毛主席亲自破土为首都人民英雄纪念碑奠基，这也就是雕塑工作者为新中国、为社会主义服务的开工典礼。全国雕塑工作者同声欢呼了！
    可是，雕塑究竟有什么作用呢？现在还有许多人不了解。说到作用，我这里不谈奴隶主、封建帝王和宗教教皇怎样利用雕塑来为他们自己宣传、炫耀、增添威风，那是过去的事了。这里，我就谈今年的全国农业展览会。一进展览会大门，我们不是看见一座高大的“工农联盟”的塑像吗？不问这件作品的好坏如何，这件雕塑艺术的具体形象叫人一见就能感到，这是我们劳动者展览劳动成果的展览会，加以装饰在四壁的大幅壁画，表现了农民、牧民、渔民愉快幸福的气氛，这就把展览会的整个精神，强烈地显示了出来，让观众一踏进会场的时候，首先就获得一个深刻而概括的印象，对展览会感到清新可爱。这就是雕塑的作用。不过，雕塑并不仅仅应用到展览会上。雕塑作品在这类展览会上所发挥的作用，还算不了什么，如果把它们搬到企业中去、农村中去，以及其他实际的生产部门中去，那么它们鼓舞人民的作用就会更大更直接。一个大都市，如果能在最重要的地方立起雕塑，那么这个都市的精神面貌，也可以通过雕塑表达出来。即将完工的首都人民英雄纪念碑，在须弥座上制作了八块表现革命烈士们不朽事迹的巨幅浮雕，叫人一看就能想到烈士们奋不顾身的斗争精神，而激起无限的爱国热情，这是有很大的意义的。现在感到不足的是，这样巨大的一座人民英雄纪念碑，建筑在这样一个正对天安门的重要的地方，而只有它的须弥座上才有浮雕，稍远些看，人们只能看见一座高大的石碑而没法看见浮雕的，也就是说，这座纪念碑并没有充分利用和更进一步发挥雕塑的作用。再具体一些说，碑座既有浮雕，碑身也应当有圆雕，如果碑上布置一个巨大的中国人民站起来的英勇的形象，那么这座纪念碑必将更有意义，同时，我们首都的整个城市也将增色不少，它不独可以生动地表现烈士们永垂不朽的奋斗精神，同时也将使人民在纪念碑前感到自豪和奋发。
    前不久我有机会看到北京市城市规划的设计图，那上面仅仅用大路小路作成一圈一圈的构图，这样是不够的。因为这种设计，只拿路为中心内容，布成平面图案，那只能坐在飞机上，才能看到这种城市的美丽，而人们行走其中，则只能看到左一条右一条的路，终于平淡无味，看不到什么美。如果能把北京各大广场用雕塑美化起来，而且把马路分别引向各个广场，使组织成散点幅射网的各个中心，这样，所有的马路上就都能看到不同的美丽的中心建设，城市也就能真正的美化了。在各个公园里和劳动人民文化宫里，也可以把革命先烈、文化名人和劳动者、运动员等的雕塑形象布置起来。也应该把雕塑应用到重要的建筑物上和水电站、桥梁等工程上，赋予这些建筑物和建设工程以性格和生命。此外，还可把雕塑布置在海口和港湾等等地方。总之，叫雕塑艺术即时以活跃的姿态出现在人民中间，以发挥它比旧时代更积极更重大的作用。当然，我并不要求“百废俱兴”，并不要求一下子把雕塑工作全部搞得非常理想，这是不可能的。但是，在目前如果有关各方面对雕塑仍然不予重视，不把它列入建设计划之中，以求有重点地逐步实现，那就要在不久的今后，在文化建设上造成难以挽回的缺陷和错误。
    目前的事实是怎样呢？自从政府为着建设社会主义，号召精简节约以后，建设部门就把文化建设首先是雕塑节约掉。天津体育馆曾向雕塑工厂订了一批雕塑，款付了，作品也完成了，终于因为怕批评，取消不用。北京市的城市规划设计之所以只用大路小路来做城市构图的中心内容，据说也是因为节约掉文化建设的缘故。这类例子很多。雕塑艺术面临的一些实际问题，应该赶快解决。文化部应当针对目前的问题，召开一定的会议作全面的深入的研究，把雕塑这一门艺术切实地作一番估价，究竟雕塑是不是奢侈品？是不是浪费？究竟雕塑会不会起积极作用？除佩带的、小型的、架上的、装饰的以外，在都市建设中应不应当给雕塑以适当的地位？
    我建议，在肯定雕塑这门艺术的效果之后，最好在适应中国都市特点的前提之下，相应地加强雕塑部门，做出文化建设的规划来，不独有计划的领导建设，而且应当有计划的宣传和布置，那才能真正完成文化建设的任务。不然，将来人民文化水平提高了，要求改建那些不好看的毫无意义的建设时，那将是更大的浪费。
    我还建议，因为我国建设部门的设计人员，对于文化建设还缺乏综合的经验，最好在中央美术学院中建立一个建筑系，让建筑家、雕塑家和画家们，一开头就养成善于合作的习惯，以共同为社会主义建设做出完美的起着积极作用的美术建筑来。
