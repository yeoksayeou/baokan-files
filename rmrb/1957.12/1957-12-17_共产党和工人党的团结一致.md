The Solidarity of Communist and Workers' Parties
Editorial Department of "Pravda" of the Soviet Union
(I)
The results of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties held in Moscow have become the focus of attention of the entire international communist movement and the international workers' movement. Communists in the Soviet Union and other countries warmly support the historical documents of the meeting – the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and the Peace Manifesto.

According to the unanimous assessment of the fraternal parties, the resolutions of the meeting have significant theoretical and practical significance for the struggle for the interests of the working class and the broad masses of people, and for the struggle for peace and socialism. These two historic documents are models of creative Marxism-Leninism. The resolutions of the Moscow meeting summarized the experience of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries in the struggle for the transition from capitalism to socialism, the experience of the Communist Parties of capitalist countries in the struggle for peace, defense of democratic freedoms, and the vital interests of the working people, and also the experience of the national liberation movement. The meeting formulated a fighting program for peace, democracy, and socialism. Armed with the resolutions of the Moscow meeting, the international communist movement is stronger, and its slogans and policies are more attractive to the broad masses.

The fact that delegations from Communist and Workers' Parties of almost all countries in the world participated in the meeting, as well as the unanimity shown in discussing extremely important issues of the international situation, clearly demonstrates the unprecedented solidarity of the world communist movement.

The basic issues raised at the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties were: the struggle against the danger of a new world war and for the consolidation of world peace, and mobilizing the masses to solve this great task;

Strengthening and uniting the socialist camp, all socialist countries;

Studying the issues of socialist construction in the people's democracies according to the common laws determined by Marxist-Leninist doctrine and taking into account the national characteristics of each country;

Exposing the essence of modern revisionism, mobilizing Communist Party members to fight against this main danger, as well as against sectarianism and dogmatism;

Studying the issue of the ways of transition to socialism in various countries based on the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union;

Determining the future paths and methods of the Communist Parties of capitalist countries in their struggle to win over the masses;

The issue of relations between Communist and Social Democratic Parties, and the struggle for the unity of the working class on a national and international scale;

Considering that for the sake of fighting victoriously for the common cause, it is essential to collectively discuss some pressing issues and establish regular contacts between the fraternal parties, and studying the ways of contact between the Communist Parties under the current conditions.

The most important idea that runs through the entire meeting is to further strengthen the unity of socialist countries, the unity of Communist and Workers' Parties; to fight for the ideological and organizational strengthening of the Communist Parties on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, on the basis of the principles of proletarian internationalism, and to recognize the necessity of uniting all forces of the communist movement.

The Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties held in Moscow put forward the most just and sublime propositions of our time to the people of the world, which reflect the sincere wishes of the vast majority. These propositions provide all progressive and anti-imperialist forces with a practical program of action that points out the most correct path to solving urgently needed international problems.

The historical significance of the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and the Peace Manifesto lies in the fact that they profoundly and powerfully reveal the peace-loving essence and liberating essence of communism in the present era, as well as the great and sublime mission that the objective process of social development bestows upon communism.

The meeting pointed out that the great socialist victory achieved by the Soviet Union in forty years has world-historic significance for the present and future of all mankind. The summary of these victories and their world-historic significance have been clearly demonstrated in the report of Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU. In this report, the magnificent prospect of building a communist society in the Soviet Union was planned.

Foreign friends spoke highly of the heroic cause of the Soviet people and their vanguard Communist Party when speaking at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the mass rally of the working people of Moscow. They all emphasized that the great achievements of the Soviet Union have paramount international significance. The achievements of the Soviet Union inspire the working people of all countries to strive for the victory of the cause of peace and socialism, and make all those who plot aggressive plans against socialist countries sober up. The victories gained by the Soviet Union contribute to consolidating the socialist positions of the people's democratic countries, strengthening the friendship and mutual support of the socialist countries, uniting the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, and enhancing the strength of peace, democracy, and socialism.

The resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU have outstanding significance. The declaration states: "The historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are not only of great significance for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the communist construction of the Soviet Union, but also opened a new stage in the international communist movement, promoting its further development on the basis of Marxism-Leninism." The success of the recent congresses of the Communist Parties of China, France, Italy and other countries powerfully demonstrates the unity of their ranks and their loyalty to the principles of proletarian internationalism.

The reactionary forces' conspiracy to undermine the prestige of the Soviet Union and weaken the ties between the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has completely failed. The prestige of the Soviet Union has been further enhanced, and the ties between the fraternal parties and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have also been strengthened. The participants of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries emphasized in the declaration that the indestructible socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union are the mighty force of modern times.

Based upon a deep analysis of the development of the international situation and the struggle of the working class and all progressive forces, the declaration made the following principled conclusion: "The main content of our time is the transition from capitalism to socialism, which was started by the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia." In the forty years since the October Revolution, the world's political situation has undergone major changes. Socialism has long exceeded the boundaries of one country and has become a world system.

The Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties was held at a time when the great superiority of socialism was particularly evident and the prestige of socialism was rising on the international stage. The construction of the world's first nuclear power plant, the most powerful synchrophasotron, the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles, and especially the development and launching of the world's first artificial earth satellites by Soviet workers, scientists, and engineers prove that the Soviet Union has surpassed the most developed capitalist countries, including the United States, in the development of many scientific and technological sectors. This is of extremely great significance for strengthening the socialist position.

The sign of the times is that the largest imperialist countries, which used to pride themselves on their cultural and scientific development and looked down on Russia, are now talking about catching up with the Soviet Union. The United States has launched a movement with the slogans "Catching up with the Soviet Union in education" and "Catching up with the Soviet Union in science and technology." The United States Senate is investigating the reasons why the United States lags behind the Soviet Union in many scientific and technological sectors.

The achievements of the Soviet Union and the entire world socialist system have an increasing impact on the international situation that is conducive to peace, progress, and people's freedom.

The Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries bear a particularly important historical responsibility to their own people and the international working class. The people of socialist countries, under the leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties, are realizing the ideas of Marxism-Leninism. The more successful the construction of a new socialist life is in socialist countries, the more people in capitalist countries will ardently believe in socialism.

The interests of the Soviet Union and the people of all socialist countries are consistent with the fundamental interests of the working people of the world. The achievements of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries inspire the working class of capitalist countries, strengthen their new forces, and contribute to their struggle. The declaration emphasizes the inseparable link between the interests of the Soviet Union and all socialist countries and the interests of the working people of the world.

The declaration says: "At present, it is in the vital interests of the working people of all countries to support the Soviet Union and all socialist countries, which pursue a policy of maintaining world peace and are bastions of peace and social progress. What the working class, democratic forces, and working people of all countries are concerned about is the continuous consolidation of fraternal ties for the benefit of the common cause, the protection of the historical, political, and social achievements of the first and most powerful socialist country, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all socialist countries, making them invulnerable to any conspiracy of the enemies of socialism, and expanding and consolidating these achievements."

The Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries form the strongest force in the international communist movement. This force has more than twenty-eight million Communist Party members.

The meeting showed that the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries hold unanimous views on all major issues such as socialist construction, fraternal cooperation, and the struggle for peace.

The declaration summarizes the common laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction in various countries that have embarked on the road to socialism, and points out the necessity of taking into account the specific historical conditions of each country, which is of principled significance. This is a fatal blow to both revisionists who exaggerate the role of national characteristics and ignore the common laws, and to dogmatists who ignore national characteristics.

The common laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction are the most important principles in Marxist-Leninist theory that have been tested by the forty years of experience of the Soviet Union and the experience of other socialist countries.

These common laws are: the working class, with the Marxist-Leninist party as the core, leads the working masses in this form or that form of proletarian revolution to establish this form or that form of proletarian dictatorship; the establishment of an alliance between the working class and the basic masses of peasants and other working strata; the elimination of capitalist ownership of the basic means of production and the establishment of public ownership of the basic means of production; the gradual realization of the socialist transformation of agriculture; the planned development of the national economy in order to build socialism and communism and improve the living standards of the working people; carrying out the socialist revolution in the ideological and cultural fields, creating a strong intelligentsia loyal to the working class, the working people, and the cause of socialism; the elimination of national oppression and the establishment of equality and fraternal friendship among all nationalities; defending the fruits of socialism from the aggression of domestic and foreign enemies; practicing proletarian internationalism and uniting with the working class of all countries.

Marxism-Leninism requires the creative application of the common principles of socialist revolution and socialist construction according to the specific historical conditions of each country, and does not allow mechanically copying the policies and tactics of other countries' Communist Parties. Whoever wants to be a proletarian revolutionary and a socialist constructor cannot ignore the objective laws, so that he will not suffer defeat in action.

The strength of the socialist camp lies in its unity. The declaration points out that the close unity of socialist countries is a reliable guarantee of the national independence and sovereignty of each socialist country.

Our enemies are also well aware of this, so they are trying to alienate socialist countries in order to defeat them one by one.

The participants of the meeting agreed: to do their best to strengthen the unity and fraternal cooperation of socialist countries and to expand and improve their economic and cultural cooperation for this purpose, to continue to implement the Marxist-Leninist policy of internationalism, to educate the working people in the spirit of combining internationalism and patriotism, and to wage a resolute struggle to overcome the remnants of bourgeois nationalism and chauvinism.

Steadfastly implementing the principles of the declaration will further enhance the unity of socialist countries and further advance the socialist world system to a climax.

(II)

Both the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and the Peace Manifesto regard the struggle for peace as the primary task.

The imperialists, especially the US aggressive group, are the center of world reactionary forces and the most vicious enemies of the masses of people. They attempt to solve the increasingly acute social and economic contradictions of capitalist countries by preparing for war, desperately trying to establish their rule over the majority of countries.

Monopoly capital is mobilizing its forces, threatening to push mankind into the flames of nuclear war. The great historical mission of socialist countries, all Communist Parties, and peace-loving forces is to stop this new dangerous crime of imperialism. The Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties emphasizes the extraordinary importance of this mission and mobilizes all peace and progressive forces to accomplish this mission, inspiring them to rise up against the forces of war and reaction.

Is it possible for imperialism to launch another world war in the face of its inevitable demise, or is it possible for people to use existing objective possibilities to prevent war? The working class was unable to prevent the First World War. The Second World War was also not prevented, despite all the efforts of the Soviet Union. However, now there are not only one, but thirteen socialist countries, including the Soviet Union and People's China, two major powers; with the support of the unprecedentedly organized international working class, the mass world peace movement, and peace-loving countries in Asia and Africa, they are fighting to prevent the Third World War. As long as they can unite and fight for the cause of defending peace, they can prevent war.

The fate of war and peace depends on the struggle. The forces of war will not abandon their plans. Not long ago they attempted to ignite the flames of war in Hungary and the Suez Canal region, just yesterday they were embarking on such an attempt in Syria, and it is not impossible for them to instigate new adventures tomorrow.

The main and most dangerous hotbeds of war are currently forming in the Middle East and West Germany. The Western aggressive groups are desperately overcoming the heavy contradictions between capitalist countries, strengthening the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and more actively implementing the "policy of strength." The upcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council in Paris is precisely to pursue these goals.

Under these circumstances, the Peace Manifesto has significant international significance. The Communist and Workers' Parties issued a lofty call to all good people to defend peace, which shows their deep concern for peace and their willingness to carry the cause of defending peace to the end.

The Peace Manifesto is not only a program of action for communists, but it will also inspire all those who support peace to join the struggle against the threat of war, attract new social strata to participate in the peace movement, and it will also stimulate a new upsurge in the world peace movement.

The Peace Manifesto is a militant document that mobilizes the people. It points out that the threat to international peace and security comes from capitalist monopoly organizations, especially US monopoly organizations. The declaration points out the path to stopping war and uniting all peace-loving forces. The declaration puts forward a program for fighting for peace and particularly emphasizes that the most urgent task is to strive for a rapid cessation of testing of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and to strive for the unconditional prohibition of the production and use of such weapons in the shortest period of time.

The Communist Parties of all countries support all efforts by any country, political party, group, movement, and individual to maintain peace and oppose war, and support all their efforts to achieve peaceful coexistence, establish collective security in Europe and Asia, reduce armaments, and prohibit the use and testing of nuclear weapons.

The Soviet Union and all socialist countries resolutely and consistently implement a policy of peaceful coexistence and strive for peace and friendship between the people of all countries.

The growth of the world socialist system, the powerful influence of socialist ideology on the people of all countries, the unity of the international communist movement, and the growing hatred of the people of all countries for the preachers of atomic war, which were clearly displayed at the Moscow meeting, are a serious warning to the aggressors. If the imperialist warmongers dare to recklessly launch a war, then there will be only one ending to the war - the demise of imperialism.

The fraternal parties' calls for maintaining peace at the two meetings have been warmly supported by the working class, the broad masses of people, and all peace-loving forces. Active activities to achieve these tasks will play a major role in preventing new wars and consolidating world peace.

　　共产党和工人党的团结一致
　　苏联“真理报”编辑部
    （一）
    各国共产党和工人党代表在莫斯科举行的会议的结果成为整个国际共产主义运动和国际工人运动的注意中心。苏联和其他国家的共产党人热情洋溢地拥护会议的历史性文件——社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言与和平宣言。
    据兄弟党的一致评价，会议的决议对争取工人阶级和广大人民群众的利益的斗争、对争取和平和社会主义的斗争具有重大的理论意义和实践意义。这两个历史性文件是创造性的马克思列宁主义的典范。莫斯科会议的决议总结了社会主义国家共产党和工人党为从资本主义过渡到社会主义而斗争的经验、资本主义国家共产党为争取和平、保卫民主自由和争取劳动人民切身利益而斗争的经验，也总结了民族解放运动的经验。会议拟定了为和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的战斗纲领。用莫斯科会议的决议武装起来的国际共产主义运动更加强大了，它的口号和政策也更加吸引广大群众。
    几乎世界上所有国家的共产党和工人党的代表团都参加了会议这一事实以及在讨论极其重大的国际局势问题时所表现的全体一致，鲜明地证明了世界共产主义运动的空前团结一致。
    共产党和工人党代表会议所提出的基本问题是：为反对新世界大战的危险、争取巩固的世界和平而斗争，动员群众来解决这个伟大的任务；
    加强和团结社会主义阵营、一切社会主义国家；
    根据马克思列宁主义学说所确定的共同规律并考虑到各国的民族特点，来研究各人民民主国家社会主义建设的问题；
    揭露现代修正主义的实质，动员共产党员同这种主要危险作斗争以及同宗派主义和教条主义作斗争；
    根据苏共第二十次代表大会的决议来研究各国向社会主义过渡的方式的问题；
    确定资本主义国家共产党今后争取群众的斗争的途径和方式；
    共产党和社会民主党之间的关系的问题，为争取工人阶级在各国和国际规模的团结而斗争；
    考虑到为了胜利地为共同事业而斗争，十分需要集体讨论一些迫切问题和建立各兄弟党之间的经常联系，研究各共产党在当前条件下联系的方式问题。
    贯穿整个会议的最重要思想是进一步加强社会主义国家的团结、共产党和工人党的团结；是在马克思列宁主义基础上、在无产阶级国际主义原则基础上，为从思想上和组织上加强共产党而斗争，承认必须把共产主义运动的一切力量团结起来。
    在莫斯科举行的共产党和工人党代表会议向全世界人民提出了当代最公正和最崇高的主张，这些主张反映了绝大多数人的衷心愿望。这些主张给一切进步的、反帝国主义力量提供了这样一个实际行动纲领：它指出了一条解决迫切需要解决的国际问题的最正确的道路。
    社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言与和平宣言的历史意义在于，它们深刻有力地揭示出在现时代共产主义的爱好和平的实质、解放的实质以及社会发展的客观进程赋予共产主义的伟大而崇高的使命。
    会议指出苏联在四十年内所取得的社会主义的伟大胜利对全人类的现在和将来都具有世界历史意义。这些胜利的总结和它们的世界历史意义已在苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫的报告中清楚地表明了。在这个报告中规划出了在苏联建成共产主义社会的宏伟前景。
    外国的朋友们在苏联最高苏维埃会议上和莫斯科劳动人民群众大会上讲话时都对苏联人民及其先锋队共产党的英勇事业作出了很高的评价。他们都强调指出，苏联的巨大成就具有头等重要的国际意义。苏联的成就鼓舞着各国劳动人民为争取和平和社会主义事业的胜利而奋斗，使一切策划着对社会主义国家的侵略计划的人清醒过来。苏联获得的胜利有助于巩固各人民民主国家的社会主义阵地，加强社会主义各国人民的友谊和互相支持，团结各国共产党和工人党，增强和平、民主和社会主义的力量。
    苏共第二十次代表大会的决议具有突出的意义。宣言中说：“苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的历史性决议，不但对于苏共和苏联的共产主义建设具有伟大的意义，而且开辟了国际共产主义运动的新阶段，促进了它在马克思列宁主义基础上的进一步发展”。中国、法国、意大利和其他国家共产党最近时期召开的代表大会的成功，有力地说明了它们的队伍的团结一致，说明了它们对于无产阶级国际主义原则的忠实。
    反动势力企图破坏苏联的威信、削弱各国共产党和工人党同苏联共产党的联系的阴谋已经完全失败了。苏联的威望更加提高了，而各兄弟党同苏联共产党的联系也加强了。社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议参加者在宣言中强调指出，不可摧毁的以苏联为首的社会主义国家阵营是现代的强大力量。
    在深刻地分析了国际局势的发展和工人阶级及全体进步力量斗争的基础上，宣言中作出下面的原则性的结论：“我们时代的主要内容是由俄国伟大十月社会主义革命所开始的由资本主义向社会主义的过渡”。在十月革命以后的四十年当中，世界的政治形势起了重大的变化。社会主义早已超出一国的范围，变成世界体系。
    共产党和工人党代表会议是在社会主义的伟大优越性特别明显地显示出来和社会主义的威望在国际舞台上日益提高的时期举行的。苏联工人、科学家和工程师建成世界上第一个原子发电站、最强大的同步稳相加速器，制成洲际弹道火箭，尤其是制成和发射出世界上第一批人造地球卫星，这就证明苏联在很多科学技术部门的发展方面已经赶过了包括美国在内的最发达的资本主义国家。这对加强社会主义阵地具有极其伟大的意义。
    时代的标志就是，从前以文化科学发展水平自负和瞧不起俄国的最大的帝国主义国家现在谈论着要赶上苏联。美国掀起了以“在教育方面赶上苏联”和“在科学技术方面赶上苏联”为口号的运动。美国参议院正在调查美国在很多科学技术部门落后于苏联的原因。
    苏联和整个世界社会主义体系的成就对国际局势的有利于和平、进步和人民自由的影响日益增长。
    社会主义国家共产党和工人党对本国人民和国际工人阶级负有特别重大的历史责任。各社会主义国家人民在共产党和工人党的领导下正在实现马克思列宁主义的思想。社会主义国家新生活的建设越是成功，资本主义国家中热烈信仰社会主义的人也就越多。
    苏联和各社会主义国家人民的利益是同全世界劳动人民的根本利益相一致的。苏联和其他社会主义国家的成就鼓舞着资本主义国家的工人阶级，使他们增加新的力量，有助于他们的斗争。宣言着重指出了苏联和一切社会主义国家的利益同全世界劳动人民的利益之间的不可分离的联系。
    宣言说：“目前，各国劳动者对于执行维护世界和平政策的并且是和平和社会进步的堡垒的苏联和所有社会主义国家给以支持，是符合他们的切身利益的。各国工人阶级、民主力量和劳动者所关切的，是为了共同事业的利益不断地巩固兄弟联系，是维护第一个和最强大的社会主义国家苏联、中华人民共和国和所有社会主义国家所取得的历史、政治和社会成果，使它们不受社会主义敌人的任何阴谋所侵犯，并且扩大和巩固这些成果。”
    社会主义国家共产党和工人党组成了国际共产主义运动的一支最强大的队伍。在这支队伍中拥有共产党员两千八百万以上。
    会议显示了社会主义国家共产党和工人党对社会主义建设、兄弟合作和争取和平的斗争等方面的一切主要问题持有一致的观点。
    宣言中总结了走上社会主义道路的各个国家的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的共同规律，并且指出了考虑到每个国家具体的历史条件的必要性，这具有原则性的意义。这不论对那些夸大民族特点的作用和忽视共同规律的修正主义者或对那些不顾民族特点的教条主义者都给予了致命的打击。
    社会主义革命和社会主义建设的共同规律是经过苏联四十年经验和其他社会主义国家的经验检验过的马克思列宁主义理论中的最重要原理。
    这些共同的规律是：以马克思列宁主义政党为核心的工人阶级，领导劳动群众进行这种形式或那种形式的无产阶级革命，建立这种形式或那种形式的无产阶级专政；建立工人阶级同农民基本群众和其他劳动阶层的联盟；消灭基本生产资料资本主义所有制和建立基本生产资料的公有制；逐步实现农业的社会主义改造；有计划地发展国民经济，以便建成社会主义和共产主义，提高劳动人民的生活水平；进行思想文化领域的社会主义革命，造成忠于工人阶级、劳动人民和社会主义事业的强大的知识分子队伍；消灭民族压迫，建立各民族间的平等和兄弟友谊；保卫社会主义果实，不让它受到国内外敌人的侵犯；实行无产阶级的国际主义，同各国工人阶级团结一致。
    马克思列宁主义要求根据每个国家的具体历史条件创造性地运用社会主义革命和社会主义建设的共同原则，不允许机械地抄袭他国共产党的政策和策略。谁要想成为无产阶级革命者和社会主义建设者，他就不能忽视客观的规律性，从而在行动中也不会遭到失败。
    社会主义阵营的强大就在于它的团结一致。宣言中指出，社会主义各国紧密的团结一致是每个社会主义国家民族独立和主权的可靠保证。
    我们的敌人也很清楚地知道这一点，因此他们力图离间社会主义国家，以便一一击破。
    会议参加者达成协议：要尽力加强社会主义各国的团结和兄弟合作以及为了这一目的而扩大和改进它们之间的经济合作和文化合作，继续实行马克思列宁主义的国际主义政策，以国际主义和爱国主义相结合的精神教育劳动人民，为克服资产阶级民族主义和沙文主义的残余而进行坚决的斗争。
    坚定不移地实现宣言的各项原则将使社会主义各国的团结更加增强，使社会主义世界体系进一步走向高潮。
　　（二）
    社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言和和平宣言中都把争取和平的斗争作为首要的任务。
    帝国主义者，首先是美国侵略集团是世界反动势力的中心和人民群众的最凶恶的敌人，他们企图用准备战争的方法来解决资本主义国家日益尖锐的社会矛盾和经济矛盾，拚命想要建立对大多数国家的统治。
    垄断资本正在动员力量，威胁着要把人类推进原子核战争的战火。社会主义国家、一切共产党和爱好和平力量的伟大历史使命，就在于制止帝国主义这个新的危险的罪行。共产党和工人党代表会议宣言强调指出这个使命具有非凡的重要意义，并动员全体和平和进步力量去完成这个使命，鼓舞它们起来反对战争势力和反动势力。
    是帝国主义能够在注定灭亡的面前再一次发动起世界大战呢，还是人们有可能利用现有的客观可能性防止战争呢？工人阶级没有能够防止第一次世界大战。第二次世界大战也没有能够防止，尽管苏联作了种种努力。然而现在已经不是一个，而是十三个社会主义国家了，其中包括苏联和人民中国这两个大国；它们在空前未有的组织起来的国际工人阶级、群众性的世界和平运动和亚非爱好和平国家的支持下，正在为防止第三次世界大战而斗争。只要能够团结一致地为捍卫和平事业而斗争，它们就能够防止战争。
    战争与和平的命运决定于斗争。战争势力是不会放弃他们的计划的。不久前他们企图在匈牙利和苏伊士运河地区煽起战争的火焰，就是昨天他们还在叙利亚着手实现这种企图，明天他们策动新的冒险也不是不可能的。
    主要的和最危险的战争策源地目前正在中近东和西德形成。西方侵略集团在拚命地克服资本主义各国间的重重矛盾，加强北大西洋公约组织，并且更加积极地执行“实力政策”。最近即将在巴黎召开的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议正是要追求这些目的。
    在这种情况下，和平宣言便有着重大的国际意义。共产党和工人党向一切善良的人们发出保卫和平的崇高号召，这表明了它们对和平的深切关怀，并且准备把捍卫和平的事业进行到底。
    和平宣言不仅是共产党人的行动纲领，而且还将鼓舞一切拥护和平的人投入反对战争威胁的斗争，吸引新的社会阶层参加和平运动，它也将刺激世界和平运动的新高涨。
    和平宣言是动员人民的战斗性文件。它指出，对国际和平和安全的威胁来自资本主义垄断组织，首先是美国垄断组织。宣言中指出制止战争和团结一切爱好和平的力量的道路。宣言提出了为和平而斗争的纲领，并且特别强调指出，最迫切的任务是争取迅速停止试验原子武器和氢武器，争取在最短时期内无条件地禁止生产和使用这种武器。
    各国共产党支持任何国家、政党、团体、运动和个人维护和平、反对战争的一切努力，支持他们争取实现和平共处、建立欧洲和亚洲的集体安全、裁减军备、禁止使用和试验核武器的一切努力。
    苏联和所有社会主义国家坚决一贯地执行和平共处的政策，为争取和平和各国人民间的友谊而斗争。
    莫斯科会议鲜明地显示出的世界社会主义体系的壮大、社会主义思想对各国人民强有力的影响、国际共产主义运动的团结以及各国人民对原子战争鼓吹者的日益增长的仇恨，对于侵略者是一个严重的警告。如果帝国主义战争狂人胆敢不顾一切地发动战争，那末战争的结局将只有一个——帝国主义的灭亡。
    兄弟党两次会议关于维护和平的号召得到工人阶级、广大人民群众和一切爱好和平的力量的热烈支持。为实现这些任务而进行的积极活动将在防止新战争和巩固世界和平方面起重大作用。
