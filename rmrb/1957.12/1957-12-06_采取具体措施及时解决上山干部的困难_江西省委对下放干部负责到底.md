　  Taking Concrete Measures to Promptly Resolve the Difficulties of Cadres Sent to the Mountains
　　Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee Takes Responsibility for Downward-Transferred Cadres to the End
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 5th: The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, with a spirit of taking responsibility to the end, is adopting various measures to care for and assist cadres sent to the mountains.

    The Provincial Party Committee believes that, for leading organs at all levels, the work of sending cadres to the mountains is only a good beginning, not the end. In the future, these cadres must be given care and assistance in many aspects.

    Provincial Party Committee leaders personally leading cadres to the mountains or establishing regular contact with cadres sent to the mountains is a significant measure taken by the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee. The first group of downward-transferred cadres from provincial-level agencies in Jiangxi have already gone to the mountains under the personal leadership of Fang Zichun, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee. One of Fang Zichun's main purposes in going to the mountains is to understand the difficulties and problems of cadres in their work, labor, and life after going to the mountains, and to understand their ideological situation, so as to help solve them in a timely manner. For the same purpose, Shao Shiping and Liu Junxiu, Secretaries of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, and several members of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee are establishing regular contact with this group of cadres sent to the mountains. The Provincial Party Committee has decided to fix this contact in order to understand the situation and solve problems in a timely manner.

    The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee believes that in the initial stage of cadres going to the mountains, the leading organs especially need to help them in a timely manner, consolidate their enthusiasm when they go to the mountains, and continue to strengthen their confidence in developing mountainous areas and carrying out labor training. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee also decided to bring back several cadres from the cadres sent to the twelve reclamation farms in mid-December to listen to their reports, systematically study and solve the problems they encountered after going to the mountains, and once again conduct ideological education work for them.

    At the same time, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee has also made corresponding arrangements for the allocation of cadres to the mountains. The twelve reclamation farms are all equipped with two senior cadres and a number of division chiefs and section chiefs, so the leadership is relatively strong. When this group of leading cadres went to the mountains, they each brought a part of the cadres from their own agencies and units; in the future, when the second group of cadres goes to the mountains, they will be assigned together with the cadres who used to be under their leadership or worked in the same agency as much as possible. This is equivalent to moving a part of their original agency to the mountains, bringing many conveniences and favorable conditions for the labor training and ideological transformation of the cadres sent to the mountains.

    In addition, the Provincial Party Committee has also given thoughtful consideration to the life, medical treatment, and family problems of this group of downward-transferred cadres, and has initially formulated unified handling methods. For cadres who are decentralized to various places, the Provincial Party Committee has instructed local Party committees and county Party committees to give them care and assistance regularly.

    These measures of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee have further encouraged the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres to participate in labor training, and strengthened the determination and confidence of the cadres sent to the mountains to overcome difficulties and build new mountainous areas. The cadres led by Fang Zichun, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and sent to the Damaoshan Reclamation Farm said that they have the support of various departments and the surrounding peasants in developing the mountainous areas, and they also have the party's warm care, so there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome.

　  采取具体措施及时解决上山干部的困难
　　江西省委对下放干部负责到底
    新华社南昌5日电　中共江西省委正本着负责到底的精神，采取各种措施关怀和帮助上山干部。
    省委认为，干部上了山，这对于各级领导机关来说，下放干部的工作仅仅是有了良好的开端，并不是结束。今后，对这些干部，还必须给予多方面的关怀和帮助。
    省委负责干部亲自带领干部上山或是和上山干部建立经常联系，这是中共江西省委采取的一项有重大意义的措施。江西省省级机关第一批下放干部，已经在中共江西省委书记方志纯亲自带领下上了山。方志纯上山的一个主要目的是，实地了解干部上山后在工作上、劳动上、生活上的困难和问题，了解他们的思想情况，以便及时帮助解决。为了同样的目的，中共江西省委书记邵式平、刘俊秀和省委的几个常务委员，正在分别同这批上山的干部建立经常联系。省委已决定把这种联系固定下来，以便及时了解情况，解决问题。
    中共江西省委认为，干部上山的初期，领导机关尤其需要及时帮助他们，把他们上山时的热情巩固下来，并继续坚定他们开发山区和进行劳动锻炼的信心。因此省委还决定，在12月中旬，从下放到十二个垦殖场的干部当中找几个回来，听取他们的汇报，比较系统地研究和解决他们上山后所遇到的问题，并再一次向他们进行思想教育工作。
    同时，江西省委对上山干部的配备也作了相应的安排。十二个垦殖场都配备了两名高级干部和一部分处长、科长级干部，领导是比较强的。这批领导干部上山时，各自带去了他们本机关本单位的一部分干部；今后第二批干部上山时，也将尽可能地把过去在他们领导之下或者是同在一个机关工作的干部配备在一起。这样，就等于把他们原机关的一部分搬上了山，给上山干部的劳动锻炼和思想改造带来许多方便和有利的条件。
    此外，省委对于这批下放干部的生活、疾病医疗和家庭问题，也给予了周到的照顾，并初步制定了统一的处理办法。对于分散地下放到各地的干部，省委责成各地委、县委经常给他们以关怀和帮助。
    中共江西省委的这些措施，更加鼓舞了广大干部参加劳动锻炼的热情，坚定了上山干部克服困难建设新山区的决心和信心。由省委书记方志纯带领下放到大茅山垦殖场的干部说，他们在那里开发山区，不仅有各部门和周围农民的支援，而且有党的亲切的关怀，是没有什么困难不可克服的。
