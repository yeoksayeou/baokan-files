Xinhua News Agency, December 19th -- The entire staff of the Ministry of Food held a meeting this afternoon to continue exposing and criticizing Zhang Naiqi's crimes of being anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist.

Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and other leaders of the two associations also attended the meeting.

Gao Jinchun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Food, spoke first at the meeting. The numerous facts he revealed showed that, although the rightist leader Zhang Naiqi had been exposed and criticized at the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress and by the Central Committee of the Democratic National Construction Association, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Food, and various parts of the country over the past few months, he not only showed no intention of repenting for his mistakes, but also tried every possible means to deny his crimes of being anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist, and adopted an extremely hostile attitude towards the Party and the people. Zhang Naiqi has been wantonly slandering those who criticized him as "rumor-mongering experts," slandering the leadership as being "deceived by rumors," and slandering the masses as being "deceived by rumors." Even yesterday—December 18th—Zhang Naiqi still described his stubborn attitude of resisting reform as "adhering to the truth" and beautified himself as "the Party's most loyal friend."

The joint speech by Zhou Boping, Hou Jianzhong, Hao Chengming, and Qi Xingqi focused on exposing Zhang Naiqi's crimes of releasing poisonous arrows from all sides in a vain attempt to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party. They pointed out: Zhang Naiqi is an old and cunning politician. He is well aware of the principle that "to oppose socialism, one must first oppose communism." Therefore, he tried every possible means to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party. On the relationship between the Communist Party and the democratic parties, he described the Communist Party's leading position stipulated in the Constitution as "great-Party-ism," openly demanding that the Communist Party examine this so-called "great-Party-ism." On the relationship between the Party and the government, he said that the Party was "substituting the Party for the government," and that "not only have the national administrative organs not been sufficiently utilized, but the national power organs have also not been sufficiently valued," openly demanding that the Party not go to the "front stage." On the relationship between the Party and the masses, he said that a "wall" and a "ditch" had formed between the Party and non-Party members. On one side of the wall and ditch were Party members with all three evils (subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucracy), complacent and special; on the other side were non-Party members, passive and inferior, suffering deeply from the three evils. In this way, Zhang Naiqi comprehensively opposed the leadership of the Party. He tried his best to instigate people to struggle against the Party, hoping to ignite counter-revolutionary evil fires in China, so as to create a situation that, as he said, "once it breaks out, it often turns into a war of words, which is difficult to control."

Zhou Boping and others also cited many facts to show that Zhang Naiqi has consistently served capitalism for thirty years and is thoroughly permeated with capitalist toxins. He hates the Party and the Party Central Committee as much as a demon who fears the light hates the sun. Therefore, his problem is not just a matter of ideology, and his mistakes are not just theoretical errors, but extremely serious anti-Party and anti-socialist political crimes.

In a joint speech, An Faqian, Zhang Jing, Lin Langtian, and Zhu Jingzhi pointed out that Zhang Naiqi's article "Starting from the Ideological Foundation of 'Walls' and 'Ditches'," published in the People's Daily on May 14 this year, was Zhang Naiqi's program of action against the Communist Party and against socialism, and it was his mobilization order to other rightists. In that article, Zhang Naiqi slandered the Communist Party for having serious "sectarianism" and "great-Party-ism," defamed the existence of a "wall and a ditch" between the Communist Party and the broad masses, insisted that Party members were "proud and complacent" and "special," and implemented a "monopoly" on Marxism-Leninism, using dogmatism to scare people. He also believed that the ideological foundation of these mistakes was the so-called "dogmatism" of the Party's leadership.

They said that Zhang Naiqi's notorious and extremely reactionary article was a concentrated manifestation of his opposition to the Party and socialism. He attempted to use the opportunity of the Party's rectification movement to beautify our Party and Party members under the guise of opposing sectarianism, and to oppose the Party's leadership by adding the label of great-Party-ism, and to provoke the relationship between the Communist Party and the broad masses and democratic parties. He also used the signboard of opposing dogmatism to oppose Marxism-Leninism, vainly attempting to disintegrate the Party from fundamental theoretical issues, in order to achieve his goal of opposing socialism and restoring capitalism.

In a joint speech, Zhang Jia, Zhang Chiyan, Ren Fengtai, Xu Youyi, Tao Dingfen, Zhou Jingxing, and Peng Hua thoroughly refuted Zhang Naiqi's series of extremely reactionary fallacies, such as "there is no fundamental difference between bourgeois elements and working-class elements" and "fixed interest is not exploitation." They pointed out that the fallacy of class equivalence fabricated by Zhang Naiqi through consistently beautifying the bourgeoisie and vilifying the working class is essentially an "allegory" that "the bourgeoisie is more intelligent than the working class," and it is the actual step in his reactionary activities of elevating the bourgeoisie and despising the working class step by step. These fallacies are by no means a theoretical issue divorced from class struggle, as Zhang Naiqi said, but an extremely sinister and vicious anti-Party weapon for carrying out class struggle. He attempted to use it to blur the class boundaries between the bourgeoisie and the working class, deny the existence of class contradictions, so that people would abandon class struggle, so that rightists could usurp the leadership of the Party and drag socialist China back to the old road of capitalism.

The last to speak was engineer Sun Shizhong. He cited a large number of facts to refute Zhang Naiqi's fallacy that the efficiency of socialism is not as good as that of capitalism. In the article "Several Issues Concerning the Guidance Work of Industrial and Commercial Transformation," Zhang Naiqi viciously described bureaucracy as a product of socialism, and said that "socialism plus bureaucracy is less efficient than modern capitalism," and that "bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism," attempting to fundamentally negate the socialist system.

Sun Shizhong pointed out that the development speed of Soviet industrial production and science and technology in the past forty years far exceeds that of any of the most advanced capitalist countries in the world. The industrial development speed of our country in the eight years since liberation has also exceeded that of capitalist countries. Even the United Nations has to admit that the country with the fastest industrial production growth rate in the world in 1956 compared to 1955 was the People's Republic of China. Sun Shizhong said that the reason why the rightist Zhang Naiqi wants to distort the facts and do his best to beautify the capitalist system can only show that he is creating a so-called "theoretical foundation" for the dream of restoring capitalism.

The meeting will continue.

    粮食部开大会撕下章乃器的画皮
    揭穿了章乃器坚持错误拒不悔改花言巧语掩饰罪行的手法
    新华社19日讯　粮食部全体工作人员在今天下午举行大会，继续揭露和批判章乃器反共反人民反社会主义的罪行。
    中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培、中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通，以及两个会的其他负责人，也参加了这次大会。
    粮食部副部长高锦纯在会上首先发言。他揭发的大量事实说明，几个月来，虽然经过第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议、民主建国会中央、全国工商联、粮食部以及全国各地的揭发、批判，右派头子章乃器对自己的错误不仅毫无悔改之意，而且千方百计地抵赖他的反党、反人民、反社会主义的罪行，并且对党和人民采取极端仇视的态度。章乃器一直在肆口诬蔑批判他的人是“造谣专家”，诬蔑领导被“谣言蒙蔽”，诬蔑群众被“谣言欺骗”。直到昨天——12月18日，章乃器还把他抗拒改造的顽固态度，说成是“坚持真理”，把自己美化成是“党的最忠实的朋友”。
    周伯萍、侯建中、郝成鸣和齐兴启的联合发言，着重揭露了章乃器从各方面施放毒箭，妄图推翻共产党的领导的罪行。他们指出：章乃器是一个老奸巨猾的政客，他十分清楚“反社会主义必先反共”的道理，所以他就千方百计地反对共产党的领导。在共产党与民主党派的关系上，他把宪法规定的共产党的领导地位，说成是“大党主义”，公然要共产党检查这种所谓“大党主义”。在党政关系上，他说党“以党代政”，“不但国家行政机构没有被足够的运用，国家权力机构也没有被足够的重视”，公然要党不上“前台”。在党群关系上，他说党与非党之间已形成了“一道墙”“一条沟”，墙和沟的一边是三害俱全的党员，居功自傲，特殊自居；另一边是非党人士，消极自卑，深受三害之苦。章乃器就是这样全面地反对党的领导，他极力煽动人们同党进行斗争，希望在中国燃起反革命的邪火，以便造成如他所说的“一旦爆发起来也往往变成舌剑唇枪，难以收拾”的局面。
    周伯萍等人还列举出许多事实说明章乃器三十年来，一贯为资本主义效忠，混身浸透了资本主义毒素，他仇恨党和党中央像惧怕光明的魔鬼仇恨太阳一样，因此，他的问题不只是思想问题，他的错误也不只是理论上的错误，乃是极端严重的反党反社会主义的政治罪恶。
    安法乾、张靖、林朗天和朱竟之在联合发言中指出，章乃器今年5月14日在人民日报上发表的一篇所谓“从‘墙’和‘沟’的思想基础说起”的文章，是章乃器反共反社会主义的行动纲领，是他对其他右派分子的动员令。在那篇文章中，章乃器诬蔑共产党有严重的“宗派主义”和“大党主义”，诽谤共产党和广大群众之间存在着“一道墙、一条沟”，硬说党员“骄傲自满”“特殊自居”，实行对马列主义的“垄断”，以教条主义来吓唬人。并且认为这些错误的思想基础就是由于党的领导的所谓“教条主义”。
    他们说，章乃器的这篇臭名远扬反动透顶的文章，正是他反党反社会主义的集中表现。他企图利用党整风的机会，一手打着反对宗派主义的幌子丑化我们党和党员，并加以大党主义的罪名来反对党的领导，挑拨共产党同广大群众和民主党派的关系；一手拿着反对教条主义的招牌来反对马克思列宁主义，妄想从根本性的理论问题上瓦解党，以此来达到他反对社会主义、复辟资本主义的目的。
    张佳、张赤炎、任凤台、徐友彝、陶鼎芬、周景星、彭华在联合发言中，彻底批驳了章乃器的“资产阶级分子和工人阶级分子没有根本区别”和“定息不是剥削”等一系列反动透顶的谬论。他们指出，章乃器通过一贯美化资产阶级，丑化工人阶级的手法制造出来的阶级等同的谬论，实质上就是“资产阶级比工人阶级更高明”的“隐语”，就是他一步一步地抬高资产阶级，蔑视工人阶级的反动活动的实际步骤。这些谬论绝不是像章乃器所说的是一个什么脱离阶级斗争的理论问题，而是章乃器的一种极为阴险恶毒的进行阶级斗争的反党武器。他企图用它来模糊资产阶级和工人阶级的阶级界限，否认阶级矛盾的存在，从而使人们放弃阶级斗争，以便右派分子们篡夺党的领导，好把社会主义的中国拖回资本主义的老路。
    最后发言的是工程师孙时仲。他列举了大量事实，驳斥了章乃器所谓社会主义的效率不如资本主义的谬论。在“关于工商改造辅导工作的几个问题”这篇文章中，章乃器曾恶毒地把官僚主义说成是社会主义的产物，又说“社会主义加上了官僚主义，效率反不如现代的资本主义”，“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人”。企图从根本上否定社会主义制度。
    孙时仲指出，四十年来苏联工业生产和科学技术的发展速度，远远地超过世界上任何最先进的资本主义国家。我国解放后八年来的工业发展速度，也超过资本主义国家。即使联合国也不得不承认，全世界1956年比1955年的工业生产速度增长得最快的是中华人民共和国。孙时仲说，右派分子章乃器所以要不顾事实地颠倒黑白，尽力美化资本主义制度，只能说明他是在为复辟资本主义的梦想制造所谓“理论基础”。
    大会还要继续举行。
