Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 27th: During the plenary session this afternoon, the head of the Japanese delegation, Tokutaro Kitamura, presented an economic report in which he proposed seven principles regarding the economic development and cooperation of Asian and African countries. He stated that economic aid is needed by Asian and African countries, "but we must oppose all restrictions related to it."

He said that people must carry out economic reforms immediately after gaining political independence. He pointed out: "In carrying out these reforms, they are faced with imperialism, which is more deeply rooted in their economic rights."

He said that we must never allow interference for political or military purposes.

Regarding trade between countries, the Japanese parliamentarian said that it should be based on equality and mutual benefit. Tokutaro Kitamura finally suggested that the seven principles he proposed be included in the resolution of the meeting.

    日本代表提出发展经济原则
    新华社开罗27日电　日本代表团团长北村德太郎在今天下午全体会议上所作的经济报告中，提出了关于亚非国家经济发展和合作的七点原则。他说，经济援助是亚非国家所需要的，“但是我们必须反对同它有关的一切限制”。
    他说，人民必须在取得政治独立以后立即进行经济改革。他指出：“在他们进行这种改革的时候，他们面对着更深地扎根于他们的经济权利中的帝国主义。”
    他说，我们决不容许怀着政治或者军事的目的来进行干涉。
    关于各国之间的贸易，这位日本国会议员说，它应该建立在平等互利的基础上。北村德太郎最后建议把他提出的七点原则列入在会议的决议中。
