    "Persuasion" and "Suppression"
    Zhang Minghui, Beijing No. 65 Middle School
    In schools, although no one publicly advocates using suppression methods on students who violate discipline, some people doubt the effectiveness of persuasion. They advocate establishing a meticulous set of rules and regulations, and when students make mistakes, deal with them according to the rules. This is simple, easy, and effective. This proposition is actually a disguised form of suppression.
    Comrades who doubt persuasion think that persuasion, after being persuaded, leads to disobedience, or only obedience for a while, and then disobedience again in the blink of an eye. Some students even take advantage of persuasion, violating discipline. When the teacher persuades them, they immediately obey, write a self-criticism, and then commit the same offense again. This phenomenon does exist. However, the reason for this phenomenon, apart from the inherent limitations of persuasive education itself, is mostly due to how the teachers conduct the persuasion.
    Some teachers' persuasion of students is essentially still suppression, that is, no matter how I say it, you have to obey. In fact, the same mistake varies greatly in different people. The reasons for making mistakes are different, the motives are different, and the attitudes towards the mistakes after making them are also different. Without understanding and analyzing, just labeling them with a few big labels and scolding them as persuasion cannot convince people. Sometimes, students who already feel guilty will develop resistance due to the teacher's rude attitude and insist on the mistake. In contrast, some teachers have a very gentle attitude towards students who make mistakes, but similarly, they do not understand or analyze the mistakes, but just generally say that this is not good, that is not right, and what should be done. After finishing speaking, they instruct, "Don't do this again next time." The students nod in agreement in front of them, but the problem is not solved ideologically, so of course, they will repeat the mistake.
    Obviously, it is unfounded to doubt the effectiveness of persuasive education because of the above or similar situations.
    There were two such incidents: one was a student who was often late, especially on bad weather days. The homeroom teacher lost his temper and scolded him, but the problem was not solved until the student became antagonistic. After a home visit, it was discovered that the student lived in a suburb far from the school. After finishing extracurricular activities in the afternoon and doing homework, it was very late. Getting up early in the morning to rush to school inevitably led to being late. The homeroom teacher proactively arranged the student's time, exempting him from afternoon extracurricular activities (the amount of activity on the student's way home was enough for an exercise), and from then on, the student not only stopped being late but also deepened his respect and trust for the homeroom teacher. The other incident was a student who repeatedly violated the rules. After the homeroom teacher repeatedly advised him, he made a self-criticism at the time, but he violated the rules again in the blink of an eye. After the homeroom teacher's detailed understanding, he learned that he was often with two backward students from other classes, influencing each other. Later, their small circle was broken up, the reasons were explained, and the requirements were strengthened. Soon, this student made progress. These two small things precisely illustrate a principle: persuasion is by no means a simple matter. Instead, teachers must devote all their energy and truly start from caring for the students, rather than "maintaining their own dignity" and "doing their duty," to be able to solve the matter.

### “说服”和“压服”

    “说服”和“压服”
    北京第六十五中　张明辉
    在学校里，对违反纪律的学生虽然还没有人公开提倡采用压服的方法，但是却有人怀疑说服的效果。他们主张建立一套缜密的规章制度，学生犯了错误，照章办事，既简单省事，而且收效迅速。这种主张实际上仍然是压服的翻版。
    怀疑说服的同志以为说服说服，说了不服，或只服一会，转眼就不服。甚至有的学生钻说服的空子，违犯了纪律，老师一说，马上就服，检讨了事，下次再犯，又如法泡制。这种现象是有的。但是所以发生这种现象，除去说服教育本身有一定局限性以外，绝大多数的问题是在于教师是怎样进行说服的。
    有的教师对学生的说服，实质上仍然是压服，即无论我怎样说你都得服。其实，同样的错误在不同人的身上就有很大差别。犯错误的原因不同，动机不同，犯了错误之后对错误所持的态度也不同。不加了解分析，扣几个大帽子，斥责一通，就当说服，是不能令人心折的。有时已有愧悔之心的学生，也会由于教师的粗暴态度产生了对抗情绪，反而坚持错误。与此相对，也有的教师对犯错误的学生态度非常和缓，同样是对所犯的错误不作了解，不作分析，只是泛泛地说这不好，那不对，应该如何如何。说完之后叮嘱一声“下次不可再这样了”。学生当面点头，但没从思想上解决问题，当然重犯。
    显然，若因为以上或与此相类情况而怀疑了说服教育的效果，是没有根据的。
    有过这样两件事：一件是一个学生经常迟到，特别是天气不好的日子，班主任大发脾气，加以斥责，直到同学生对立起来也没有解决问题。经过一次家庭访问，才发现学生住在离校很远的郊区，下午完了课外锻炼回家，再作完功课就很晚了，早上再起早赶路，就免不了迟到。班主任主动地给学生安排好时间，免除了下午的课外锻炼（学生回家路上的活动量足抵一次锻炼），从此这个学生不但不再迟到，而且对班主任的尊敬和信任加深了。另一件是一个屡次犯规的学生，经班主任再三劝诫，当时虽然作了检讨，但转眼就又犯规了，经过班主任的详细了解，才知道是和别班两个落后同学经常在一起，相互影响。后就拆散他们的小圈子，讲清道理，加强要求，很快这位同学进步起来了。从这两件小事，恰恰说明一个道理，说服决不是一件简单的事，而是要教师投入全部精力，真正从爱护学生出发，而不是为“维护自己的尊严”和“例行公事”，就可以了事的。
