Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th - TASS reports: The Indian Ministry of External Affairs handed a letter from Indian Prime Minister Nehru to the Soviet government and the US government on November 28th to the Soviet Embassy in India, concerning the cessation of nuclear weapons testing and the arms race. On December 10th, Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin replied to Nehru, stating that the Soviet government is willing to solemnly announce the cessation of nuclear explosion tests from January 1, 1958, if the United States and the United Kingdom, who possess such weapons, announce their agreement to cease their planned tests from the same date.

Bulganin's Reply to Nehru

In his letter, Bulganin once again emphasized that the Soviet government believes that an immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing is the first and extremely important step towards resolving the entire disarmament issue, eliminating the atmosphere of fear and mistrust in international relations, and ensuring lasting world peace. It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet government submitted a disarmament proposal to the current session of the UN General Assembly, advocating the conclusion of an agreement to at least first cease atomic weapons testing for two or three years. Bulganin said that we are ready to sign such an agreement at any time. The Soviet Union has consistently and firmly maintained that neither ballistic rockets nor hydrogen and atomic bombs should ever be used for destructive purposes, and that the great achievements of human thought should only be used for the peaceful development of human society.

The letter stated that the Soviet Union, now as in the past, advocates concluding a treaty of friendship with the United States, establishing good relations with all countries, disbanding military blocs, or concluding an agreement between members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and members of the Warsaw Treaty, obligating them to resolve disputes only by peaceful means, and stopping the publication of all hostile rhetoric advocating new wars by newspapers and radio stations in certain countries.

From the recent statements of some important political leaders in the West, one cannot help but conclude that the US and British governments do not intend to solve the disarmament issue, nor do they intend to agree to ban atomic and hydrogen weapons. The leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization do not conceal the fact that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting scheduled to be held in Paris on December 16th will discuss ways and means to intensify the expansion of armaments, and study new military strategic plans, which will stipulate equipping the armies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states with nuclear weapons and rocket weapons.

Bulganin then emphasized that the so-called "interdependence" between members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, formulated by Eisenhower and Macmillan in their Washington talks, proves their intention to exert new pressure on members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other aggressive blocs, in order to more fully use their resources and further deprive them of their independence in foreign policy for the purpose of preparing for war.

Bulganin said that now, on the eve of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, there are calls to unite military blocs such as the North Atlantic Group with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact in one form or another. Once this plan is realized, it means taking another step towards aggravating international tensions, the danger of a new war is more imminent, and it threatens the peace in Asia and the security and independence of countries on the Asian continent that are following the path of independent development. The realization of this plan will bring devastating consequences to the activities of the United Nations.

Bulganin pointed out in the letter that the results of the recent talks between Eisenhower and Macmillan show that the leaders of the United States and Britain not only agreed to support each other in implementing colonial policies in the Middle East, but also agreed to support each other in attempting to ensure their rule over other Asian and African countries. The Eisenhower Doctrine, based on the notorious "vacuum" theory, has actually become the Eisenhower-Macmillan Doctrine. Needless to say, the Soviet government believes that the so-called "vacuum" theory is particularly dangerous for Asian and African countries; the people of Asian and African countries have the indisputable right to decide their own destiny, free from all external interference or oppression.

Bulganin said that there is another approach in international politics that opposes the attempts of Western countries to force other countries to accept their will with force and the threat of force. The Soviet Union, China, and India, along with many other countries, adhere to this approach, which is the approach of easing international tensions and the approach of peaceful coexistence between countries. It is precisely in the interest of safeguarding peace that the Soviet government has put forward the following proposal at the current session of the UN General Assembly: that the Assembly calls on all countries to establish their relations with each other on the basis of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, in short, on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence. As everyone knows, these five principles were announced in the statements of India and China, and later at the Bandung Conference.

Bulganin's letter concludes by saying that the Soviet government is convinced that there is still time to prevent the disaster threatening people. As long as there is a desire to reach a universally accepted agreement, as long as people take the path of honest and equal negotiations, that is, the path of making decisions acceptable to all relevant countries, it is possible to stop the arms race and improve the international situation.

Nehru's Letter to the Soviet and US Governments

In his letters to the Soviet and US governments, Nehru stated that he appeals to the leaders of the great powers, especially the leaders of the US and Soviet Union, to stop all nuclear test explosions, thereby demonstrating to the world their determination to stop this threat and continue to strive for effective disarmament.

Nehru said that psychological fears must be eliminated, and the dangerous trend that threatens the future survival of mankind must be changed. These problems can only be solved through direct contact and reaching agreements in a peaceful manner.

Nehru also said in his letter that our land is too narrow for the new weapons of the atomic age. At the same time, mankind is opening up paths into outer space, and is opening the skies, relying on its own wisdom and knowledge. Nehru said that the ongoing nuclear weapons test explosions are poisoning the air, water, and food, causing direct harm to today's humans and future generations.

Nehru said that the people of the whole world have the right to demand peace and security. At present, the only way to retain these rights is to peacefully coexist and solve problems in a peaceful manner. The only path is to coexist peacefully regardless of differences, and abandon policies of hatred and violence.

Nehru said that he has no doubt that the United States and the Soviet Union have the ability to stop this scourge that threatens all mankind.

    布尔加宁复信给尼赫鲁表示
    苏联愿明年起停止核爆炸试验
    条件是美英两国也采取这一重要步骤
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：印度外交部在11月28日把印度总理尼赫鲁就停止核武器试验和军备竞赛的问题写给苏联政府和美国政府的信件交给了苏联驻印度大使馆。苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在12月10日复信给尼赫鲁，表示苏联政府愿意郑重地宣布从1958年1月1日起停止核爆炸试验，如果拥有这类武器的美国和英国宣布它们同意从同一天起停止他们所准备进行的这类试验的话。
    布尔加宁给尼赫鲁的回信
    布尔加宁在信中再一次强调指出，苏联政府认为立即停止核武器试验是解决整个裁军问题、消除国际关系中的恐惧和不信任气氛和保障世界持久和平的第一个和极端重要的步骤。正是因为如此，苏联政府才向联合国大会本届会议提出裁军建议，主张缔结一项那怕是首先停止试验原子武器两三年的协定。布尔加宁说，我们准备在任何时候签订这样一个协定。苏联过去和现在都坚决主张，无论是弹道火箭和氢弹及原子弹，都永远不应当用于破坏的目的，人类思想的伟大成就应当只用于人类社会的和平发展。
    信中说，苏联现在仍旧和过去一样主张同美国缔结友好条约、同所有国家建立良好的关系、解散军事集团或者目前在北大西洋公约组织成员国和华沙条约成员国之间缔结一项责成它们只用和平方法解决争端的协议、制止某些国家的报纸和电台发表鼓吹新战争的一切敌意言论。
    从最近西方一些重要的政治领袖的声明中，不能不得出这样的结论：美国和英国政府并不打算解决裁军问题也不打算同意禁止原子武器和氢武器。北大西洋公约组织的领袖们不掩盖这样一个事实：预定12月16日在巴黎召开的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议将讨论加紧扩充军备的途径和方法，研究新的军事战略计划，这些计划将规定以核武器和火箭武器装备北大西洋公约组织成员国的军队。
    布尔加宁接着着重指出，艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦在华盛顿会谈中制订了所谓北大西洋公约组织成员国之间的“互相依赖主义”，这证明他们打算对北大西洋公约组织和其他侵略集团的成员国施加新的压力，以便为了达到准备战争的目的而更充分地使用它们的资源和更加剥夺它们在外交政策上的独立。
    布尔加宁说，现在，在北大西洋公约组织理事会会议的前夕，有人叫嚷着要把北大西洋集团同东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约之类的军事集团用这种或那种形式联合起来。一旦这个计划得以实现，它就表示：向加剧国际紧张局势方面又迈进一步，新战争的危险更加迫近，并且威胁着亚洲的和平地区和亚洲大陆走上独立发展道路的各国的安全与独立。这种计划的实现将给联合国的活动带来毁灭性的后果。
    布尔加宁在信中指出，从艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦最近会谈的结果可以看出，美国和英国的领导人士不仅在对中近东国家实行殖民主义政策方面约定互相支持，而且在企图保证自己对其他亚非国家的统治方面也约定互相支持。以臭名昭彰的“真空”说法为基础的艾森豪威尔主义实际上变成了艾森豪威尔—麦克米伦主义。不用多说，苏联政府认为所谓“真空”说法对亚非国家是特别危险的；亚非国家人民有着自己决定自己命运，不受一切外来干涉或压迫的无可置辩的权利。
    布尔加宁说，在国际政治中有另外一条方针与西方国家想用武力和武力威胁强迫别国接受自己意志的企图相抗衡，苏联、中国和印度同其他许多国家坚持这种方针，这就是缓和国际紧张局势的方针，各国和平共处的方针。苏联政府正是本着保障和平的利益，在现在举行的联合国大会本届会议上提出下列建议：大会呼吁各国在互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政的基础上，在平等互利的基础上，简单地说，就是在和平共处原则的基础上建立彼此的关系。大家知道，在印度和中国声明中，后来在万隆会议上都宣布了这五项原则。
    布尔加宁的信最后说，苏联政府深信，还来得及防止威胁着人们的毁灭。只要有争取达成普遍接受的协议的愿望，只要人们采取诚实和平等谈判的道路，也就是作出为一切有关国家所能接受的决定的道路，那么停止军备竞赛、改善国际局势是可能的。
　　尼赫鲁给苏美两国政府的信
    尼赫鲁在写给苏联政府和美国政府的信中表示，他向大国领导人、特别是向美、苏两国领导人，呼吁停止一切核试验爆炸，从而向全世界表明他们有决心制止这种威胁和继续争取有效的裁军。
    尼赫鲁说，必须消除心理上的恐惧，并且改变那种威胁着人类今后的生存的危险趋向。这些问题只有通过直接接触和以和平方式达成协议的途径才能解决。
    尼赫鲁在信中还说，对原子时代的新式武器来说，我们的土地是太狭窄了。而与此同时，人类依靠自己的智慧和知识，开辟着进入星际空间的道路，正在打开天空。尼赫鲁说，正在进行的核武器试验爆炸毒化着空气、水和食物，给今天的人类和后代带来直接的损害。
    尼赫鲁说，全世界人民都有权要求和平和安全。目前要保有这些权利，就只有和平共处，用和平方式解决问题。唯一的道路就是不问分歧、和平共处，放弃仇视和暴力的政策。
    尼赫鲁表示，他毫不怀疑美苏两国有能力制止这种威胁着全人类的祸害。
