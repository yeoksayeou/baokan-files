Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 15th: The Soviet representative to the United Nations delivered a note from the Soviet government to the Spanish representative to the United Nations on December 13th, requesting him to forward it to the Spanish government.

The Soviet government, in its note, considers it necessary to first draw attention to the fact that the upcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Council in Paris may be a new and dangerous step towards an atomic war with the most serious consequences.

The Soviet government's note states that although Spain is not a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it has military agreements with the United States that link it to the North Atlantic bloc. According to these agreements, the United States has built air and naval bases in many cities on Spanish territory. Therefore, attention should be paid to the danger that the residents of those cities may face when strategists of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization launch a new war.

The Soviet government proposes immediately abandoning the use of nuclear weapons and halting experimental explosions of such weapons from January 1st next year as a first step towards normalizing the international situation. The second step is to establish collective security in Europe. A non-aggression treaty could now be signed between the North Atlantic Alliance and the Warsaw Treaty countries. It is of great significance that major powers do not deploy any kind of nuclear weapons on foreign territories. Expanding trade ties and removing discriminatory restrictions in this regard can play an important, even decisive, role in building the necessary trust among countries and establishing a solid foundation for friendly relations.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 15th: The Soviet representative to the United Nations delivered a note from the Soviet government to the Portuguese representative to the United Nations on December 13th, requesting him to forward it to the Portuguese government. The note pointed out that the interests of maintaining peace require all countries to take steps to prevent the danger of a new war threatening the world.

The Soviet government noted the issue of arming members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with atomic and hydrogen weapons, establishing missile launching sites on the territories of these countries, and storing American nuclear weapons.

The note pointed out that Portugal has bases of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on its mainland or islands. This cannot exempt it from the tragic consequences of modern warfare.

The Soviet government then pointed out that the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are hoping to further militarize West Germany at the upcoming meeting and are preparing to arm the West German army with nuclear weapons.

The Soviet government proposes gradually resolving certain international issues, including the issue of disarmament. The note said that the first step should be to abandon the use of nuclear weapons and stop the experimental explosions of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The Soviet government believes that this can be done starting from January 1st next year.

The Soviet government pointed out that building trust between countries plays a decisive role, and that expanding trade ties and removing unequal restrictions in this regard, as well as developing scientific and technological ties, will have a beneficial effect. The note also mentioned the Soviet Union's peaceful initiatives such as establishing a collective security system.

    苏联分别照会西葡两国政府  提请注意新战争的严重后果
    据新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏联驻联合国代表12月13日把苏联政府的一份照会交给西班牙驻联合国代表，请他转交西班牙政府。
    苏联政府在照会中首先认为必须注意这一事实：北大西洋公约组织即将在巴黎召开的理事会会议可能是走向具有最严重后果的原子战争道路的新的危险步骤。
    苏联政府的照会说，虽然西班牙不是北大西洋公约组织的成员国，但是它同美国订有军事协定，这些协定把它同北大西洋集团联系起来。根据这些协定，美国在西班牙领土上的许多城市中建有空军和海军基地。因此应当注意那些城市的居民在北大西洋公约组织的战略家发动新战争时可能遭到的危险。
    苏联政府建议立即摒弃使用核武器，并且从明年1月1日起停止这种武器的试验性爆炸，以此作为使国际局势正常化的第一步。第二步是建立欧洲集体安全。北大西洋联盟和华沙条约国家间现在就可以签订互不侵犯条约。各大国不在外国领土上配置任何种类的核武器这件事具有重大意义。扩大贸易联系和取消这方面的歧视性限制能够在建立各国的必要信任和建立各国友好关系的巩固基础方面起重要的、甚至是决定性的作用。
    据新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏联驻联合国代表13日把苏联政府的一份照会交给葡萄牙驻联合国代表，请他转交葡萄牙政府。照会中指出，维护和平的利益要求一切国家采取步骤来防止威胁世界的新战争的危险。
    苏联政府注意到用原子武器和氢武器来武装北大西洋公约组织成员国、在这些国家的领土上建立火箭发射基地和存放美国核武器的问题。
    照会指出，葡萄牙陆地上或者海岛上都设有北大西洋公约组织的基地。这一点不可能使它免于现代战争的悲惨后果。
    苏联政府接着指出，北大西洋公约组织的首脑指望在即将召开的会议上使西德进一步军国主义化，并且准备用核武器武装西德军队。
    苏联政府建议逐步解决某些国际问题，其中包括裁军问题。照会中说，第一步应该是放弃使用核武器和停止进行原子武器和氢武器的试验爆炸。苏联政府认为从明年1月1日开始就可以这样做。
    苏联政府指出，各国之间建立信任具有决定性的作用，而扩大贸易联系和取消这方面的不平等的限制以及发展科学技术联系将会发生良好的作用。照会中还谈到了苏联关于建立集体安全体系等和平倡议。
