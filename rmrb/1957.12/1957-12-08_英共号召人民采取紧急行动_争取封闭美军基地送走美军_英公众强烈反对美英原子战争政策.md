Xinhua News Agency, London, December 7th: The British Communist Party issued a statement today calling on the British people to take urgent action to close US bomber bases before they become missile bases. The statement said that Britain's security requires the immediate return of all US troops to the United States.

The statement also pointed out that the upcoming NATO meeting "further increases the urgency for Britain to break away from the threat of US nuclear policy." The statement said that the sole purpose of the NATO summit is to "intensify preparations for nuclear war and further deepen US control over Europe."

The statement said: "The world does not need this kind of meeting of Western war alliances that increases international tension and brings nuclear war closer. The world needs a completely different kind of meeting—a meeting with the Soviet Union that can ease tensions and reach an agreement on banning all nuclear weapons."

The statement said that peaceful coexistence is the only way to save mankind from terrible disasters.

Xinhua News Agency, London, December 7th: The nuclear war policy that the United States and Britain intend to forcibly push through at the NATO Paris meeting is arousing increasingly strong opposition from British public opinion.

Communist Party and trade union leaders have repeatedly called for a genuine summit meeting between the major powers to agree on ways of peaceful coexistence. At the same time, in Parliament, Labor MPs have been urging the government to stop their dangerous policies and start negotiations with the Soviet Union. Many constituency Labor Party organizations are calling on the government to take new diplomatic initiatives.

"New Statesman" published an editorial today saying: "Dulles's established policy is to arm all NATO countries with nuclear weapons. This is certainly the fastest road to destruction."

"New Statesman" said that this proposal to provide all Western countries with suicide buttons will be met with serious opposition.

Former US Ambassador to Moscow, Kennan, delivered a series of speeches to the British public through the BBC, which aroused great interest among the British public because his views differed from the official US views. He admitted that the Western nuclear strategy is suicidal and called for the withdrawal of the armed forces of the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union from the central region of the continent.

Even the Conservative Party's "Daily Mail" published an editorial today saying: "The West now needs ideas as much as it needs weapons."

The newspaper criticized the lack of US leadership, saying that the US policy's vision seems to extend no further than missile diplomacy. The newspaper admitted: "What is making the West so sluggish is precisely the theory that dealing with weapons with weapons is the only possible diplomatic strategy."

The "Daily Mail" described the situation of NATO as very bleak when the NATO meeting was to be held in Paris in nine days. It said: "Britain and the United States have just quarreled with France over the issue of arms shipments to Tunisia. Britain is arguing with West Germany over the maintenance costs of troops stationed in the Rhine region. The small European countries are uneasy about the plan to establish a series of rocket bases on their territory."

Xinhua News Agency, December 6th: TASS News Agency, New York, December 4th: A group of well-known American educators, pastors, and social activists have asked the US government to stop testing nuclear weapons, and first of all, to cancel a series of new nuclear weapon tests that the United States plans to conduct in the Pacific next April.

They issued a statement saying: "We believe that conducting such tests on the high seas outside US territory is morally unjust and politically extremely dangerous, because the residents of other countries there not only do not agree, but also oppose these tests, and the residents there will be harmed by these tests..."

The statement continued: The US government is using the Soviet Union's launch of artificial satellites as an excuse to "strengthen the arms race, a situation that has caused great anxiety." They said: "We believe that this is a foolish and non-constructive reaction. Only when Americans take the lead in demanding a halt to the arms race will they be truly wise and brave."

　　英共号召人民采取紧急行动
　　争取封闭美军基地送走美军
　　英公众强烈反对美英原子战争政策
    新华社伦敦7日电　英国共产党今天发表声明，要求英国人民采取紧急行动来争取封闭美国轰炸机基地，而不要等到它们变成导弹基地。声明说，英国的安全要求立即把全部美国部队送回美国去。
    声明还指出，即将举行的北大西洋公约组织会议“又增加了英国摆脱美国原子核政策威胁的迫切性”。声明说，北大西洋集团最高级会议的唯一目的是“加紧原子核战争的准备工作和进一步加深美国对欧洲的控制”。
    声明说：“全世界不需要西方战争联盟的这种增加国际紧张局势和使原子核战争更加接近的会议，全世界需要的是完全不同的一种会议——一种有苏联参加的，能够缓和紧张局势和就禁止一切核武器达成协议的会议。”
    声明说，和平共处是使人类免遭可怕的灾难的唯一道路。
    据新华社伦敦7日电　美国和英国打算在北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议上强行推行的原子核战争政策正在引起英国舆论愈来愈强烈的反对。
    共产党和工会领袖们一再要求大国之间举行真正的最高级会议，商定和平共处的办法。同时，在议会里，工党议员一直在力促政府停止他们的危险政策，开始同苏联谈判。许多选区的工党地方组织要求政府在外交上采取新的主动。
      “新政治家”今天发表社论说：“杜勒斯的既定政策是用核武器武装北大西洋公约组织的所有国家。这肯定是招致毁灭的最快的道路。”
      “新政治家”说，这种给所有西方国家提供自杀的电钮的建议将遭到严重的反对。
    前美国驻莫斯科大使凯南通过英国广播公司向英国公众发表的一连串演说，引起了英国公众很大的兴趣，因为他的意见跟美国官方意见不同，他承认西方原子战略是自杀性的，要求美英苏三国武装部队一律撤出大陆中心地区。
    甚至保守党的“每日邮报”今天也发表社论说：“西方现在正像它需要武器一样需要主意。”
    报纸批评美国领导不够时说，美国政策的眼光似乎没有超过导弹外交以外。报纸承认：“使西方这样萎靡不振的正是这种认为用武器对付武器是唯一可能的外交策略这种理论。”
    “每日邮报”在北大西洋公约组织九天后就要在巴黎举行会议的时候把北大西洋公约组织的情况说得非常惨淡。它说：“英美刚刚由于运给突尼斯军火问题同法国争吵过。英国正在由于驻来因地区军队的维持费问题同西德争吵。欧洲各小国都对在它们领土上建立一系列火箭基地的计划感到不安。”
    据新华社6日讯　据塔斯社纽约4日讯：一批著名的美国教育家、牧师和社会活动家要求美国政府停止试验核武器，首先是取消美国预定明年4月在太平洋进行的一系列的核武器新试验。
    他们发表声明说：“我们认为，在美国领土以外的国际公海上进行这种试验在道德上是不正当的，并且在政治上也是极其危险的，因为在那里的其他国家居民不但不同意，而且还反对这些试验，那里的居民会受到这些试验的危害……”。
    声明接着说：美国政府以苏联发射人造卫星为借口来“加强军备竞赛，这种情况已经引起极大的不安”。他们说：“我们认为，这是一种愚蠢的非建设性的反应。只有美国人率先要求停止军备竞赛，他们才算是真正明智和勇敢。”
