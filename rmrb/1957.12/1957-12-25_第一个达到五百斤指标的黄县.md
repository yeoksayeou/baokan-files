Huang County, the First to Reach the 500 Jin Target

By our reporters Xiang Cun and Xiao Yan

In 1956, Huang County, Shandong Province, achieved an average grain yield of 599 jin per mu, far exceeding the provincial average of 263 jin per mu. It achieved, ahead of schedule and beyond target, the 500-jin grain yield target outlined in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), becoming a model of high yield for more than 100 counties in the province to learn from.

Although Huang County suffered an unprecedented drought this year, its annual grain output still maintained a relatively stable harvest, averaging over 500 jin per mu (excluding soybeans). Among the county's 347 agricultural cooperatives, 84 averaged over 500 jin of grain per mu, 42 averaged over 600 jin, and 18 averaged over 700 jin. The Da Yaojia Agricultural Cooperative in Zhongcun Township achieved a yield as high as 930 jin per mu.

Huang County's natural conditions are not considered good. Mountainous and hilly areas account for about 40% of the land, and plains account for 60% (the province's cultivated land is about 30% mountainous and hilly, and 70% plains). Coupled with the characteristics of frequent droughts in nine out of ten years, spring droughts, autumn floods, and late autumn droughts, the original grain production level was not high. In 1944, the county's average yield was only 220 jin per mu. However, after collectivization, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the county actively changed the natural conditions, resulting in a great leap forward in production.

Grasping the Construction of Farmland Water Conservancy

The leading organs of Huang County prominently focused on farmland water conservancy as the key to increasing production, overcoming drought with the greatest determination and perseverance. Wells were widely dug throughout the county, regardless of whether they were three or five zhang deep, to bring up groundwater. Before 1944, the county had only 33,500 wells, and irrigated land accounted for only 18% of the total cultivated area. However, during the production upsurge from the previous winter to spring, in just a few months, the county dug more than 13,000 new wells and built 80 new ponds and reservoirs, rapidly increasing the irrigated area to 55%, allowing wheat and corn, which accounted for the largest sown area in the county, to be irrigated four and three times, respectively.

This year, the number of wells has increased to nearly 100,000, with an average of one well for every seven mu of land.

The vigorous development of farmland water conservancy enabled Huang County to maintain a relatively high yield this year under the severe threat of drought. This year, Huang County's rainfall was only 284 mm, a reduction of two-thirds compared to last year. Moreover, the rainfall was both dispersed and untimely. In August and September, when rain was most needed, the rainfall was only 55.3 mm. 320,000 mu of corn did not receive a single soaking rain from sowing to harvest, relying entirely on more than 70,000 windlasses, waterwheels, and other water-lifting tools to irrigate mu by mu, repeatedly. Among them, 292,000 mu of autumn corn were watered three times, with an average yield of 430 jin per mu, estimated to be nearly one and a half times higher than dryland corn. When the wheat-sowing season arrived, half of the reservoirs and wells had dried up, and even the large and small rivers were dry due to 60-70 days of prolonged drought. The county's farmers, day and night, utilized and excavated all water sources, launching a vigorous campaign to combat drought and plant wheat. Finally, under the severe threat of drought, the sowing task of 460,000 mu of wheat was completed.

Boldly Reforming the Cropping System

Huang County boldly reformed the cropping system, changing from three crops in two years to two crops in one year and three crops in one year, which unprecedentedly increased the utilization rate of the land. This year, the county's multiple cropping index reached 169.9%, with one mu of land playing the role of 1.7 mu of land. Last year, 500,500 mu of cultivated land in the county implemented two crops in one year, with an average annual yield of 763 jin per mu, while cultivated land with three crops in two years had an average yield of 532 jin per mu. The yield difference was 231 jin per mu. The Da Yaojia Agricultural Cooperative in Zhongcun Township achieved a multiple cropping index of 202.3% this year. In addition to 80% of the cultivated land being two crops in one year, with an average yield of 883 jin per mu, the remaining cultivated land implemented three crops in one year (planting sorghum after harvesting wheat, and planting Chinese cabbage after harvesting sorghum), with an average yield of 692 jin of grain per mu and 5,656 jin of Chinese cabbage.

In terms of cultivation technology, Huang County also adhered to the rational close planting of wheat and corn, and vigorously promoted the Huangxian Dali Banmang and Bima No. 4 wheat varieties, and the Dama Ya and other corn varieties, which are most suitable for local planting. These are all effective measures to obtain high yields.

This year's severe drought resulted in Huang County harvesting more than 70 million jin of grain less than last year. However, natural disasters have not become an obstacle to Huang County's production progress. On the contrary, they have made the people of the county more deeply aware of the great role of farmland water conservancy and strengthened their confidence in vigorously developing water conservancy. It has also prompted people to further tap production potential and strive to solve problems such as pig raising for manure accumulation and soil improvement. They have decided to strive for another great leap forward in production, increasing the average yield per mu next year to 707 jin, an increase of 40% compared to this year. The people of the county are full of confidence in achieving this ambitious plan and have already expressed it with practical actions. The 460,000 mu of wheat in the county are being universally irrigated for the second time. By implementing the "five waterings and three fertilizations" measures and strengthening wheat field management, the county will strive to make 300,000 mu of wheat become high-yield fields with more than 350 jin per mu. Through the production upsurge this winter and next spring, by the end of next year, the county will dig 15,000 new wells, build 236 medium- and small-sized reservoirs and ponds in mountainous areas, and repair five canals and 8,000 gate-controlled gullies, expanding the county's irrigated area to more than 80%, basically achieving water conservancy throughout the county. In response to the weakness of underdeveloped pig raising and manure accumulation in the past, the county will vigorously develop pig raising and manure accumulation, requiring the number of live pigs to reach 120,000 next year and the amount of soil fertilizer applied per mu to increase to 4,800 jin. In addition, specific plans have also been formulated for continuing to reform the cropping system and improve cultivation techniques.

Currently, a large-scale and vigorous winter production upsurge has fully unfolded in Huang County. Their goal for the next ten years is no longer simply to exceed the average yield of 500 jin per mu, but to achieve the great plan of an average yield of 1,500 jin per mu and an average possession of 1,882 jin of grain per agricultural population.

    第一个达到五百斤指标的黄县
    本报记者　向村　肖彦
    山东省黄县，1956年的粮食产量，平均每亩达到了五百九十九斤，远远超过了全省每亩平均产量二百六十三斤的水平，提前并超额实现了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）五百斤粮食产量指标，成为全省一百多县学习的丰产榜样。
    黄县今年虽遭受了百年来未有的大旱，可是粮食年产量仍然保持了相对稳定的丰收，平均每亩产量达五百斤以上（不包括大豆）。全县三百四十七个农业社中，平均每亩产粮五百斤以上的有八十四个，六百斤以上的有四十二个，七百斤以上的十八个。仲村乡大姚家农业社每亩产量高达九百三十斤。
    黄县的自然条件并不算好，山区、丘陵区约占40％，平原占60％（全省耕地面积山区、丘陵约占30％，平原约占70％），加上十年九旱和春旱秋涝、晚秋又旱的特点，原来的粮食生产水平不高。1944年全县平均每亩产量只有二百二十斤。由于人多地少，每人平均只有一亩六分地（全省每人平均二亩六分二）。可是，合作化以后，全县人民在党的领导下积极改变自然条件，使生产跃进了一大步。
    抓紧兴修农田水利
    黄县的领导机关，突出地抓紧了兴修农田水利这一增产关键，用最大的决心和毅力战胜干旱。全县普遍打井，不管井深三丈、五丈，也要把地下水引上来。在1944年以前，全县只有三万三千五百眼水井，水浇地仅占耕地总面积的18％。可是在前冬去春的生产高潮中，在短短的几个月内，全县即打新井一万三千多眼，新修了八十座塘坝和水库，使水浇地面积迅速增加到55％，使占全县播种面积最大的小麦和玉米，达到了水浇四次与三次。
    今年水井已发展到近十万眼，全县平均七亩多地就有一眼井。
    大力发展了农田水利，使黄县今年能在旱灾的严重威胁下，保持了较高的产量。今年黄县的降雨量仅二百八十四公厘，比去年降雨量减少三分之二。而且降雨既分散又不适时，最需要雨水的8、9月份，仅仅降雨五十五点三公厘。有三十二万亩玉米，从播种到收获，就没有得过一次透雨，全凭七万多个辘轳、水车和其他提水工具，一亩一亩、一遍一遍地进行浇灌。其中二十九万二千亩秋玉米浇了三遍水，每亩平均产量达到四百三十斤，估计比旱玉米平均每亩能增产近一倍半。当种麦季节到来的时候，由于已有六、七十天久旱未雨，半数的水库、水井已枯竭，大小河流也都干了。全县农民又不分昼夜地利用和挖掘一切水源，掀起一个轰轰烈烈的突击抗旱种麦运动。终于在旱灾严重威胁之下完成了四十六万亩小麦的播种任务。
    大胆改革耕作制度
    黄县大胆地进行了耕作制度的改革，变二年三作三收为一年二作二收和一年三作三收，使土地的利用率空前提高了。今年全县的复种指数达到169.9％，一亩地发挥了一亩七分地的作用。去年全县有五十万零五千亩耕地实行了一年二作二收，每亩平均年产量达到七百六十三斤，而二年三作三收的耕地，每亩平均产量五百三十二斤。同样一亩地，产量相差二百三十一斤。仲村乡大姚家社农业社，今年的复种指数达到了202.3％，全社除80％的耕地是二作二收，平均每亩产量达八百八十三斤外，其余的耕地实行了三作三收（拔了小麦种黍子，拔了黍子栽大白菜），平均每亩产粮食六百九十二斤，大白菜五千六百五十六斤。
    黄县在耕作技术方面，还坚持了小麦和玉米的合理密植，并大力推广了最适于当地种植的黄县大粒半芒和碧玛四号等小麦良种及大马牙等玉米良种。这些，都是获得高额丰产的有效措施。
    今年的大旱，虽使黄县较去年少收了七千多万斤粮食，但是自然灾害并没有成为黄县生产前进的阻力，相反的，它却使全县人民更深刻地认识到兴修农田水利的巨大作用，坚定了大兴水利的信心，同时也促使人们去进一步挖掘生产潜力，努力解决养猪积肥和改良土壤等问题。他们已决定要争取生产的再一次大跃进，要把明年的每亩平均产量，增加到七百零七斤，比今年增产40％。全县人民对实现这个雄伟的计划充满了信心，而且已用实际行动表达出来。全县四十六万亩小麦正在普遍浇灌第二遍水。经过贯彻“五水三肥”的措施和加强麦田管理，全县要争取三十万亩小麦成为每亩产三百五十斤以上的丰产田。经过今冬明春的生产高潮，到明年年底，全县将打新井一万五千眼，在山区修建中、小型水库、塘坝二百三十六座，修渠道五条，闸山沟八千个，使全县水浇地面积扩大到80％以上，达到全县基本上水利化。针对过去养猪积肥不够发达的弱点，要大力开展养猪积肥事业，要求明年生猪达到十二万头，每亩施土肥量增加到四千八百斤。此外，对继续改革耕作制度，改良耕作技术等方面，也制定了具体规划。
    目前，一个规模壮阔、轰轰烈烈的冬季生产高潮，已在黄县全面展开。他们今后十年内的奋斗目标，已经不是一般地超过平均亩产五百斤的水平，而是达到平均亩产一千五百斤、每个农业人口平均占有粮食一千八百八十二斤的伟大计划。
