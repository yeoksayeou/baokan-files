Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: The agricultural production materials manufactured by organized handicraft laborers in various regions have powerfully supported agricultural production.

Of the production materials produced by handicraft cooperative organizations in various regions, farm tools alone amounted to 230 million pieces in 1956, more than double the number in 1955, averaging more than 300 farm tools manufactured for each agricultural cooperative. The total number produced this year has greatly exceeded the figure for 1956. Especially since the upsurge of the agricultural production movement in the countryside, all farm tool handicraft cooperatives have been involved in this movement, manufacturing and repairing farmland irrigation tools and farm tools day and night. Henan Province alone has produced and repaired more than 2 million various small farm tools and water lifting tools this year, with nearly 10,000 people participating in the repair work. Handicraft production cooperatives in Shanxi, Jiangsu, and other provinces have instructed their grassroots cooperatives to make actively supporting the great leap forward in agricultural production this winter and next spring their current central task.

In addition to manufacturing farm tools, handicraft production cooperative organizations have universally established repair networks in recent years to repair old farm tools for farmers. Repair stations or repair points are set up in plain areas where agricultural cooperatives are more concentrated. In remote areas during busy farming seasons, mobile repair teams often go to the fields or production teams to work. According to incomplete statistics from fourteen provinces including Hebei, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Liaoning, more than 32,500 fixed and mobile farm tool repair stations and repair teams have been established, repairing hundreds of millions of farm tools for farmers. Some provinces have basically achieved the goal of having points in every township, people in every cooperative, and being available upon call.

In order to closely integrate handicraft production with agricultural production and avoid blindness in production, since last year, handicraft cooperative organizations in various regions have adopted methods such as signing production and sales contracts with agricultural cooperatives or linking up with supply and marketing cooperatives, so that the farm tools produced are more suitable for the needs of farmers.

The preparatory committee of the All-China Handicraft Production Cooperative recently issued instructions on further supporting agricultural production by handicraft cooperatives, requiring handicraft production cooperatives in various regions to strengthen close ties with agricultural production cooperatives, investigate and grasp new supply and demand patterns in rural areas to organize production and supply; and in their work, they must implement the spirit of rectification and improve the quality of service to agriculture a step further.

### 夜以继日赶制农具  各地手工业者积极支援农业

　　夜以继日赶制农具
    各地手工业者积极支援农业
    据新华社13日讯　各地组织起来的手工业劳动者制造的农业生产资料，有力地支援了农业生产。
    各地手工业合作组织生产的生产资料中，仅农具一项，1956年生产了二亿三千万件，比1955年增加一倍以上，平均给每个农业社制造了农具三百多件。今年生产的总数又大大超过1956年的数字。特别自农村掀起了农业生产运动高潮以来，农具手工业社都无一例外地投入这个运动，夜以继日地制造和修配农田水利工具和农具。仅河南一个省今年生产和修理的各种小农具及提水工具有二百多万件，参加修配的人数将近一万人。山西、江苏等省手工业生产合作社都已指示各基层社，把积极支援今冬明春农业生产大跃进作为当前中心任务。
    手工业生产合作组织除了制造农具以外，近年来普遍建立修配网，为农民修理旧农具。在农业社较为集中的平原地区，都设有修配站或修配点，在边远地区农事紧张季节，流动修配组经常到田间或生产队去工作。据河北、江苏、广东、云南、辽宁等十四省的不完全统计，共建立固定和流动的农具修配站和修配组达三万二千五百多个，为农民修理的农具数以亿计。有的省基本上做到乡乡设点、社社有人、随叫随到。
    为了使手工业生产与农业生产密切结合，避免生产上的盲目性，自去年以来，各地手工业合作组织采用了与农业社订立产销合同，或与供销社挂钩等办法，使生产的农具等更适合农民的需要。
    全国手工业生产合作总社筹备委员会最近发出了关于手工业合作社进一步支援农业生产的指示，要求各地手工业生产合作社加强与农业生产合作社的密切联系，调查和掌握农村新的供求规律，来组织生产和供应；在工作中必须贯彻整风精神，把为农业服务的工作质量提高一步。
