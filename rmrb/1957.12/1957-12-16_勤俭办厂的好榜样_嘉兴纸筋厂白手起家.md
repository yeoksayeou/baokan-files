A Good Example of Running a Factory Thriftily
Jiaxing Paper Pulp Factory Starts from Scratch

    (Our report) According to Zhejiang Daily: The Jiaxing Paper Pulp Factory, which is now of considerable size, was built from scratch, from small to large, and with diligence and thrift. In the first half of 1954, fifteen unemployed workers, with the support of the government, started paper pulp production as a form of self-help. Over the past three years, they have developed the factory into one with more than 160 workers, producing 3,000 tons of paper pulp annually, and the output value has increased sixteenfold. Last year alone, the factory handed over 46,000 yuan in profits; this year, they plan to hand over 120,000 yuan in profits.

    In the early days of running the factory, they had nothing but a little over 1,100 yuan in capital. They had no factory buildings or production tools, and they didn't even understand the technology for producing paper pulp. What to do? They rented ancestral halls and other places as factory buildings; borrowed scrapped engines from brother factories, repaired them, and used them as power equipment; found three peasant brothers who were engaged in paper pulp side-business, learned from them for more than a month, and mastered the production technology. The factory had no dormitories, so the workers used their spare time to build their own shacks; without beds, they slept on straw piles. The factory could not pay wages, so the workers suggested that wages could be temporarily withheld, but the factory must continue to operate.

    By the end of 1956, the factory's production had made some progress. The factory was preparing to build factory buildings. Don't think they were going to build high-rise buildings. No, they were building simple and practical factory buildings with flat tiles, straw roofs, and mud walls. When building the houses, except for asking for help when building the sheds, everything else was done by the workers themselves: building walls, leveling the ground, and installing electric lights. Originally, they planned to use new bricks to pave the site. After calculation, it would cost more than 7,500 yuan. They again did it themselves, collecting old bricks to pave the ground, and as a result, it only cost more than 1,800 yuan.

    The factory has a total of ten administrative and political staff, accounting for just over 6% of the total number of employees. General management personnel hold multiple positions. For example, the financial accountant also handles planning, and also serves as a cook and messenger. Sales personnel also manage finished product storage and boat allocation. Although they hold multiple positions, their enthusiasm is still very high, and they can unite, help each other, and cooperate closely. For example, when sales personnel are away, site management personnel help manage boat allocation; if there is not enough time to prepare plans, other cadres help.

    The factory's leaders can share weal and woe with the masses and mingle with the workers in every way. The workers said: "The leaders have no airs, they are completely the same as us, they do everything."

    勤俭办厂的好榜样
    嘉兴纸筋厂白手起家
    本报讯　据浙江日报报道：现在已具相当规模的嘉兴纸筋厂，是由无到有、由小到大、克勤克俭办起来的。1954年上半年，十五个失业工人在政府的扶持下，以生产自救方式开始搞纸筋生产。三年多来，他们已把工厂发展成为一个有一百六十多个工人、年产三千吨纸筋的工厂，产值增长了十六倍。去年一年，这个厂上缴利润四万六千元；今年，他们还计划上缴利润十二万元。
    在办厂初期，他们除了一千一百多元资金以外，厂房、生产工具一无所有，连生产纸筋的技术也不懂。怎么办呢？他们就租用祠堂等做厂房；向兄弟厂借来报废了的引擎加以修理，作为动力设备；找到了三个搞纸筋副业的农民兄弟，学了一个多月，学会了生产技术。厂里没有宿舍，工人就利用业余时间自己搭草棚；没有床铺，就睡稻草堆。厂里发不出工资，工人提出工资可以暂时不拿，厂一定要办下去。
    到了1956年年底，工厂的生产已有了一定的发展。厂里准备盖厂房。大家别以为他们要盖高楼大厦了。不是的。他们盖的是平瓦房和草顶、泥墙、简朴实用的厂房。盖房子时，除搭草棚时请人帮助以外，砌墙、平地面、装电灯，一切都是工人自己动手。原来打算用新砖头铺场地。一算，得花七千五百多元钱。他们又自己动手，搜集旧砖铺地，结果只花了一千八百多元。
    这个厂的行政管理人员和政治工作人员一共十人，占职工总数的6％多一点。一般管理人员都身兼数职。如财务会计兼搞计划，同时也当炊事员、通讯员。供销人员也兼管成品保管和船只调配。虽然兼职多，但他们的积极性仍旧很高，并能团结互助、密切配合。如供销人员外出时，场地管理人员就帮助管理船只调配；编制计划来不及，其余干部就一同帮着做。
    这个厂的领导人员能够和群众同甘共苦，处处与工人打成一片。工人说：“领导没有架子，完全和我们一样，什么事都做。”
