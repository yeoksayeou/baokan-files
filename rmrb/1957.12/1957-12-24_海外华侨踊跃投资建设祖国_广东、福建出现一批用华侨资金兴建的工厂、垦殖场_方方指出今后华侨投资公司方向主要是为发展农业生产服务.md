    A Batch of Factories and Reclamation Farms Built with Overseas Chinese Funds Appear in Guangdong and Fujian
    Fang Fang Points Out that the Future Direction of Overseas Chinese Investment Companies is Mainly to Serve the Development of Agricultural Production
    (Our Newspaper News) According to the Guangzhou Daily, during the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the broad masses of overseas Chinese enthusiastically invested in and participated in the construction of the motherland. According to statistics from the Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Investment Company, from the company's establishment in March 1955 to the end of November 1957, the amount of investment by overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots increased by one time compared with the investment absorbed by the South China Enterprise Company and the Overseas Chinese Industrial Construction Company from 1951 to 1954. The investing overseas Chinese come from more than 30 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Americas.
    In the past five years, overseas Chinese have invested in the expansion and construction of a total of sixteen factories in Guangdong Province that are currently in production, with five more under construction. After these factories are put into production one after another, they will play a certain role in supplying the material needs of the people, expanding the supply of domestic and foreign markets, and prospering the economy of the hometowns of overseas Chinese. The current three overseas Chinese sugar factories alone can produce more than 60,000 tons of sugar annually, which, if supplied to the people of Guangdong Province, would average more than three catties per person per year.
    In terms of land reclamation, two reclamation farms have been established in Baoting County, Hainan Island: one is the Xinmin Reclamation Farm, which has already planted more than 6,000 mu of rubber. The other is the Sandao Overseas Chinese Reclamation Farm, which plans to plant 15,000 mu of rubber, 6,000 mu of oil palm, and 1,500 mu of coffee on an area of 25,000 mu of land, and also engage in livestock farming such as pig raising.
    In terms of service industries, the Beijing New Overseas Chinese Hotel and the Guangzhou Southern Building were established with overseas Chinese funds. In order to better receive overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, a magnificent Overseas Chinese Building has also been built on the side of the Haizhu Bridge in Guangzhou.
    On the basis of the production and development of these enterprises, the Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Investment Company has obtained a certain amount of profit over the years. Using these profits, not only have shareholders been paid an annual dividend of eight percent, but a considerable amount of public reserve funds has been accumulated, thereby expanding production. Many overseas Chinese and their relatives have also solved the needs of supporting their families and providing education for their children through investment and dividends, and some shareholders have also used the dividends they have received to run public welfare undertakings.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 21st) The Fujian Overseas Chinese Investment Company held an enlarged meeting of the board of directors in Xiamen City on the 17th. The meeting decided to invest in the construction of eleven factories in the hometowns of overseas Chinese in 1958.
    Fang Fang and Zhuang Mingli, deputy directors of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, were invited to participate in the meeting. Fang Fang also spoke at the meeting, saying: Overseas Chinese investment companies should continue to develop their own businesses in accordance with the national production plan. He pointed out that the direction of development for investment companies in the future is mainly to serve the development of agricultural production, such as building fertilizer plants. At the same time, some farms should also be established to meet the needs of resettling returned overseas Chinese and providing employment for returned overseas Chinese students who cannot get into schools.
    The Fujian Overseas Chinese Investment Company already owns nineteen factories.

    海外华侨踊跃投资建设祖国
    广东、福建出现一批用华侨资金兴建的工厂、垦殖场
    方方指出今后华侨投资公司方向主要是为发展农业生产服务
    本报讯　据广州日报报道：第一个五年计划期间，广大华侨踊跃投资参加祖国建设。据广东省华侨投资公司统计，从这个公司于1955年3月成立至1957年11月底止，华侨及港澳同胞投资数量，比华南企业公司和华侨工业建设公司从1951年至1954年吸收的华侨及港澳同胞投资增加一倍。投资的华侨遍及亚、欧、非、澳、美五大洲的三十多个国家。
    五年来，华侨在广东省投资扩建、新建而目前已经投入生产的工厂共有十六个，正在建设的有五个。这些工厂陆续投入生产以后，对于供应人民物资需要，扩大国内外市场供应，繁荣侨乡经济都起着一定的作用。仅目前的三座华侨糖厂，每年可产砂糖六万吨以上，将它供应广东全省人民，平均每人每年可有三斤多。
    在垦殖事业方面，已经在海南岛保亭县建立了两个垦殖场：一个是新民垦殖场，目前已种植了六千多亩橡胶。另一个是三道华侨垦殖场，这个场准备在二万五千亩面积的土地上种植橡胶一万五千亩、油棕六千亩、咖啡一千五百亩，并兼营养猪等农牧事业。
    在服务事业方面，用华侨资金建立了北京新侨饭店，广州南方大厦。为了更好地接待华侨和港澳同胞，又在广州海珠桥边建立一座宏伟的华侨大厦。
    在这些企业生产发展的基础上，广东省华侨投资公司历年获得了一定的利润。利用这些利润，不仅发付了股东年利八厘的股息，而且积累了相当数目的公积金，从而扩大了生产。不少华侨和侨眷也通过投资领股息解决了赡养家庭、供应子弟求学等需要，有些股东还利用所得的股息去兴办公益事业。
    据新华社福州21日电　福建华侨投资公司17日在厦门市举行董事会扩大会议。会议决定1958年在侨乡投资建设十一个工厂。
    华侨事务委员会副主任方方、庄明理应邀参加了这次会议。方方并在会上讲了话，他说：华侨投资公司应该根据国家生产计划，继续开展本身业务。他指出，今后投资公司发展的方向主要是为发展农业生产服务，如兴建肥料厂等。同时，还应该办一些农场，以适应安置归侨和考不上学校的归国华侨学生就业的需要。
    福建华侨投资公司已经拥有十九个工厂。
