This newspaper's Nanchang, 16th dispatch: Nearly seven thousand outstanding cadres drawn from the Party, government, mass organizations, and enterprises and institutions of Jiangxi Province and Nanchang City will depart in batches for the mountains and countryside within days.

Among these transferred cadres, there are thirty-six cadres at the level of department or bureau director or above, two hundred and fifty cadres at the level of deputy section chief or above, and leading district-level cadres account for more than 40% of the total number of cadres participating in labor production. Among the cadres selected, there are one thousand one hundred and seventy-seven Communist Party members and one thousand one hundred and eighty-four Communist Youth League members. These cadres have been divided into thirteen large teams, with a maximum of seven hundred people per team and a minimum of over two hundred people. They will all directly participate in the construction of socialist forestry bases and comprehensive agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery reclamation farms in the thirteen large mountainous areas newly developed by the province.

These mountainous areas, such as Jinggang Mountain, Wugong Mountain, Jiulian Mountain, and Deshengguan, all have mild climates, abundant rainfall, fertile land, and rich resources. Prior to this, the Provincial People's Committee had sent advance teams for surveying. After half a month of hard work, they not only ascertained the basic situation of the mountainous areas, but also built many temporary houses at the foot of the mountains and in the valleys, repaired and cleaned up some dilapidated houses, and purchased beds, cookware, and daily necessities, making preparations for the arrival of the large teams.

On the 15th, nearly 100,000 people from all walks of life in Jiangxi Province and Nanchang City held a grand farewell meeting to send off these cadres who are about to head to the mountainous areas. At the meeting, Shao Shiping, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Jiangxi Province, encouraged everyone, saying: "We must have the courage and determination to overcome difficulties and conquer difficulties, carry forward the spirit of lofty revolutionary heroism, engage in selfless labor, and build new socialist mountainous areas and new socialist countryside. We must conquer nature and excavate all the treasures and powers of nature to serve the needs of the people's production and life, and to serve socialist and communist construction." Xiong Longfei, the representative of the cadres going to the mountains, made a guarantee on behalf of the transferred cadres at the conference: We are determined to turn barren mountains into green forests, turn wilderness into fertile fields, build mountainous areas into paradises, and train ourselves into revolutionary fighters who are proficient in both civilian and military affairs.

    江西省和南昌市级机关干部上山下乡打先锋
    七千干部出动开发十三个大山区
    本报南昌16日电　江西省省级和南昌市的党、政、群机关以及企业事业单位抽调的近七千名优秀干部，日内即分批出发上山、下乡。
    这批下放干部中，有厅、局长以上干部三十六名，副科长以上干部二百五十名，主要区级干部占参加劳动生产干部总人数的40％以上。被抽调的干部中，有共产党员一千一百七十七人，共青团员一千一百八十四人。这批干部，被分成十三个大队，每队最多达七百人，少的也在二百人以上。他们都将直接参加省里新开发的十三个大山区的社会主义林业基地和农林牧渔综合垦殖场的建设。
    这些山区，如井冈山、武功山、九连山、德胜关等地都是气候温和，雨量充沛，土地肥沃，蕴藏着丰富的资源。在这以前，省人民委员会曾派出先遣部队进行勘测。经过半个月的辛勤劳动，他们不但摸清了山区的基本情况，而且还在山脚下、山谷里搭起了许多临时性的住房，修缮打扫了一些破旧房子，床铺、锅碗和日常用品都已经采办齐全，为大队到来作好了准备工作。
    15日，江西省和南昌市各界近十万人举行了盛大欢送会，欢送这批即将开往山区的干部。会上，中共江西省委书记、省长邵式平勉励大家说：一定要有克服困难、战胜困难的勇气和决心，要发扬高度革命的英雄主义精神，进行忘我的劳动，去建设社会主义的新山区、新农村。要征服自然，发掘自然界一切宝藏和力量，来为人民生产生活需要而服务，为社会主义、共产主义建设而服务。上山干部的代表熊龙非在大会上代表下放干部提出保证：决心把荒山变成绿林，把原野变成良田，把山区建设成乐园，把自己锻炼成文武双全的革命战士。
