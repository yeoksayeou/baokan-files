　　Down to the Countryside Diary
　　Fang Xu
　　A small sickle, not much thicker than a large calligraphy brush handle, is so uncooperative. Look, the remaining rice stalks are a mixture of high and low; like an unskilled barber giving a haircut that's uneven.

　　Over there, a young man is even more of a problem. He only cuts a width of three or four rice stalks, just enough to fit his two feet, and then he rushes forward with a burst of energy; everyone else is left far behind. He is working hard enough. His speed in cutting rice is fast enough. He may even think his initial performance is worthy of first class. But the rice he cuts is piled up in a mess because there is not enough space to put it down properly. The threshers have to reorganize the rice he cut, forcing them to slow down the threshing work.

　　So people can't help but offer their opinions.

　　The opinions of the comrades who came with me are based on facts, arguing from the actual results. He immediately understands.

　　The girls from the agricultural cooperative burst into a series of giggles, laughing so hard they clutched their stomachs and bent over. Their opinion is just laughter. Of course, he understands. And his face turns red. He stands there blankly….

　　From the field to the threshing ground, the distance is only a little over half a kilometer, but with a load of grain on your shoulders, this half kilometer seems to be stretched ten times longer, as if you'll never finish walking it. Time also seems to slow down deliberately, just to make things difficult for you. The load becomes heavier and heavier, as if someone is secretly following behind you, adding more grain. You can't lift your head, you can't straighten your waist, your face is strained and red, and at this moment the only hope in your heart is to carry the grain to the threshing ground as soon as possible; it's as if the entire universe temporarily ceases to exist here. Now you need courage, you need even greater patience; even if it means walking for one minute and resting for ten. Perseverance leads to victory.

　　When the production team leader weighs the grain, it's a full eighty catties (approximately 40kg). At this time, you can truly appreciate what the joy after hard labor is like. Although your legs are still shaking, and your shoulders feel as if they've been burned by fire, you temporarily forget about all of it.

    下乡小记
　　方徐
    一把小小镰刀，并不比大号毛笔杆粗大多少，却那末不听使唤。你看，留下的禾根，一丛高一丛低；像一个不熟练的理发师，把头发修得高低不齐。
    那边一个小伙子更成问题。他只割开三、四株稻禾宽的面，恰好能放下他两只脚，就一股气往前割；别人都老远落在他后面。他是够卖力了。他割禾的速度是够快了。他也许还以为他的初试成绩是够得上头等的。可是他割下的稻禾因没有足够空地堆放，堆乱了。打谷的人必须把他割下的稻禾重新整理一番，迫着放慢了打谷工作。
    于是人们不能不提意见了。
    同来的同志们的意见是根据事实，从实际效果来论证一番。他一下子就能明白过来。
    农业社的姑娘们却是一连串嗤嗤的笑声，笑得捧腹哈腰。她们的意见就是笑声。当然他也会意的。而他的脸也通红了。他茫然地站着……。
    从田里到晒谷场，距离不过一里多地，但是一担谷子在肩头，这一里多路像一下子就拉长了十倍，老是走不完。时间也像特别放慢脚步，故意和你为难。担子越走越重，好像有人偷偷尾随给你增加谷子。头抬不起，腰伸不直，脸色紧张得通红，此时心里唯一的希望是尽快把谷子挑到晒场；好像宇宙的一切在这里都暂不存在。现在需要勇气，需要更大的耐心；哪怕走一分钟休息十分钟。坚持就能胜利。
    当生产队长把谷子过秤，足足八十斤。这时，你才能真正体会到艰苦劳动后的愉快是什么样的滋味。虽然两只腿还在打抖，肩头像刚受火灼过似的热辣辣，暂时都忘掉了。
