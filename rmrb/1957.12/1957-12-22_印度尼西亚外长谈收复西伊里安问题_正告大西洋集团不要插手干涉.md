Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 21st - Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio stated in Parliament today that in the current dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands, Indonesia is striving not to invite any major powers or any countries from either bloc to expand this dispute. Therefore, the government calls on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization not to interfere in this dispute.

Subandrio delivered a report to Parliament today on behalf of the government regarding the relations between Indonesia and the Netherlands. Almost all members of Parliament attended the meeting.

The Indonesian Foreign Minister said that the Indonesian government still adheres to the principle of peaceful resolution. The Indonesian government will consider any efforts made by any party to achieve such a resolution.

He said that if the Netherlands wants to resolve the West Irian issue through peaceful means, Indonesia is still willing to resolve it through negotiations.

The Foreign Minister warned that if the Netherlands tries to force Indonesia to submit with the assistance of its allies, then the Indonesian government will be forced to reconsider the principle it has been adhering to for the sake of national and state sovereignty. In this regard, the British government has been warned not to allow Singapore to become a base for the activities of Dutch warships, as doing so would harm Indonesia's interests.

Subandrio said that the Indonesian government will remain vigilant against Dutch military pressure under any circumstances and has made the necessary preparations. He pointed out that in the process of resolving the West Irian issue, the Indonesian people will inevitably face various difficulties and tests.

The Foreign Minister pointed out that the Indonesian government's current efforts are all aimed at recovering West Irian as soon as possible, laying the foundation for the country's economy as soon as possible, and improving Indonesia's international status and international relations.

The Indonesian Foreign Minister said that the Indonesian government's policy is very clear. Whether the issue will become the starting point for normal relations between the Netherlands and Indonesia or become the last page in the history of the two countries' relations now depends on the Netherlands.

    印度尼西亚外长谈收复西伊里安问题
    正告大西洋集团不要插手干涉
    据新华社雅加达21日电  印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约今天在国会里说，在目前印度尼西亚和荷兰之间的争执中，印度尼西亚正在尽力地不要邀请任何大国或两个阵营中的任何国家来扩大这一争端，因此，政府呼吁北大西洋公约组织不要干涉这一争执。
    苏班德里约今天代表政府向国会作关于印度尼西亚和荷兰的关系的报告。几乎全体国会议员都出席会议。
    这位印度尼西亚外交部长说，印度尼西亚政府仍然坚持和平解决的原则。任何方面为实现这种解决方式而作的努力，印度尼西亚政府都将予以考虑。
    他说，如果荷兰想通过和平方法来解决西伊里安问题，印度尼西亚仍然愿意通过谈判来解决。
    这位外交部长警告说，如果荷兰想凭借它的盟国的协助来迫使印度尼西亚屈服，那么，印度尼西亚政府为了民族和国家主权，将会被迫重新考虑它一直在坚持的这个原则。在这方面，已经告诫英国政府不要让新加坡成为荷兰军舰活动的基地，因为那样做的结果会使印度尼西亚的利益受到损害。
    苏班德里约说，印度尼西亚政府会对任何情况下的荷兰军事压力保持警惕，并且已经作了必要的准备。他指出，在解决西伊里安问题的过程中，印度尼西亚人民不免要面临各种各样的困难和考验。
    这位外交部长指出，印度尼西亚政府现在所作的努力，都是为了早日收复西伊里安，为了早日给国家的经济奠下基础，以及为了改善印度尼西亚的国际地位和国际关系。
    印度尼西亚外交部长说，印度尼西亚政府的政策是非常清楚的。问题将会变成荷兰和印度尼西亚之间的正常关系的起点，还是变成两国关系的历史的最后的一页，现在要看荷兰的了。
