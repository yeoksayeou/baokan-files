　　Mobilize All Positive Factors and Strive to Further Develop Production, Consolidate and Improve Handicraft Cooperative Organizations!
　　Abstract of Bai Rubing's Report at the First Member Representative Assembly of the All-China Handicraft Cooperative

　　The Great Transformation from Individual to Collective

　　China's handicraft industry is very developed. Its industries are complex, its products are diverse, and its distribution is wide. It has a close and inseparable relationship with the production and life of urban and rural people. In 1956, the annual output value of handicrafts accounted for about 9.1% of China's total industrial and agricultural output value and 16.6% of the total industrial output value. This shows that handicrafts occupy a considerably important position in China's national economy.

　　In recent years, while giving priority to the development of heavy industry, the Party has vigorously supported the development of handicraft production and fully exerted its positive role in the national economy.

　　There are two different paths for developing handicraft production. One is the capitalist road: that is, the fate of handicraft laborers is in the hands of capitalists, speculators, and usurious exploiters, a road where a few get rich and the majority become poor and bankrupt. The other road is the socialist road: that is, the vast number of handicraft laborers, under the leadership of the working class, control their own destiny, organize themselves, get rid of exploitation, develop production, and become prosperous together. Historical facts have fully proven that this is a correct and bright road.

　　The development of China's handicraft cooperative movement is rapid and healthy.

　　Especially after Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" was published in October 1955, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, we convened the Fifth National Handicraft Production Cooperation Conference in December, reviewed the conservative thinking that leadership was lagging behind the masses, and studied and formulated a comprehensive plan for the socialist transformation of handicrafts. In January 1956, driven by the high tide of socialist transformation across the country, handicraft laborers in various industries and regions demanded to be organized, starting from cities, and quickly forming a nationwide high tide of handicraft cooperation. Up to now, more than five million people across the country have been organized into 100,000 handicraft cooperatives (groups), accounting for 92% of the number of people transformed by the handicraft sector. Most of the other handicraft laborers have also joined agricultural production cooperatives, and a few have joined joint state-private enterprises. In this way, the great transformation of handicraft laborers from individual economy to collective economy has achieved a decisive victory. This historically significant victory completely destroyed the material basis for the continuous generation of capitalism in the handicraft field. The tragic history of Chinese handicraft laborers being oppressed and exploited for thousands of years has gone forever.

　　Now, let's look at the great advantages of handicraft cooperation.

　　First, due to cooperation, changing from individual economy to collective economy, handicraft production has greatly developed.

　　Before liberation, the most prosperous era of handicraft production was 1936. However, during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, due to the serious devastation of imperialist aggression and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the output value of handicrafts declined year by year. By 1949, on the eve of liberation, it was only 42.7% of that in 1936. After liberation, handicraft production increased year by year. In 1956, the total output value of handicrafts increased by 60% compared with 1952, exceeding the output value of 1936 by 54.6%, completing the output value target of the first Five-Year Plan for 1957 one year ahead of schedule. In the first four years of the first Five-Year Plan, handicraft production increased by an average of 12.4% per year. Comparing the output value of 1956 with that of 1952, the production of means of production increased by 93%, and the production of consumer goods increased by 51%. The output value of handicraft cooperative organizations in 1957 is expected to increase by another 10.3% compared with 1956. In 1956, the average output value per person in handicraft production cooperatives was 2,086 yuan, an increase of 47.9% compared with 1952, an average annual increase of 10.35% in four years. In 1956, it almost exceeded twice that of 1936.

　　The development of production is also reflected in the continuous improvement of product quality, the gradual reduction of costs and prices, and the improvement and innovation of varieties and designs.

　　The rapid development of handicraft production is the inevitable result of cooperation. This is because: (1) After cooperation, the original individual private ownership was changed to the collective ownership of the cooperative, and the old patriarchal feudal relations and exploitative relations were changed to new, democratic, and mutually cooperative relations, freeing the productive forces from the shackles of the relations of production. (2) After cooperation, the original individual production was changed to collective production, making it possible to implement division of labor and cooperation in production, improve backward production technologies, increase labor productivity, and on this basis, gradually expand public accumulation and gradually change from manual production to semi-mechanized and mechanized production. (3) After cooperation, it is possible to concentrate greater manpower, materials, and financial resources, and establish economic ties with state-owned and cooperative-operated commerce, gradually strengthen planning, and overcome the blindness and instability in production.

　　Second, due to cooperation and the development of production, handicrafts have played an active role in adapting to social needs and have become a powerful assistant to state-owned industry.

　　In terms of serving agricultural production: taking the production of agricultural tools for farmers alone, handicraft cooperatives (groups) across the country produced 110 million pieces in 1955, which increased to 230 million pieces in 1956, averaging more than 300 pieces of agricultural tools manufactured for each agricultural cooperative. Various regions also produced a large number of improved agricultural tools and new-style agricultural tools according to production seasons, farming habits, and other conditions. At the same time, handicraft cooperatives in various regions also universally organized agricultural tool repair and assembly networks. According to incomplete statistics from fourteen provinces such as Hebei and Jiangsu, more than 32,500 fixed and mobile agricultural tool repair and assembly stations and groups have been established, repairing and assembling hundreds of millions of agricultural tools for farmers.

　　In terms of serving the needs of urban and rural people's lives: handicraft cooperatives (groups) have produced a large number of clothing, hats, shoes, socks, brocade embroidery, wooden furniture, glass ceramics, and other daily necessities to supply people's needs. After economic reorganization, life services and various repair businesses have not only been preserved, but also improved in service quality.

　　In terms of serving industrial production and basic construction: in 1956, handicraft cooperatives (groups) across the country produced 4.3 billion bricks and tiles, 1.68 million tons of lime, and a large number of industrial accessories, small hardware, railway spikes, etc., which are countless.

　　In terms of providing export goods and earning foreign exchange for the country: taking only arts and crafts, the total export value from 1950 to 1956 reached more than 330 million yuan. This foreign exchange can be used to purchase about one million tons of steel rails.

　　Handicraft cooperatives are also an important aspect of expanding the country's tax revenue and providing construction funds. During the first Five-Year Plan period, handicraft cooperative organizations paid a total of more than 700 million yuan in taxes to the state, excluding tax reductions and exemptions.

　　Third, due to cooperation, the material and cultural life of handicraft laborers has also been correspondingly improved on the basis of production development.

　　In old China, poverty and bankruptcy were the inevitable fate of handicraft laborers. However, after being organized, the situation has greatly changed. In 1956, about 90% of the members across the country increased their labor income compared with before joining the cooperative. Among them, the average annual wage of each employee in production cooperatives reached 347 yuan, an increase of 66% compared with 1952. Handicraft cooperative organizations in large and medium-sized cities and some counties (cities) implemented medical subsidies, and some cooperatives implemented free medical care, with wage subsidies during sick leave and maternity leave. Many cooperatives have also set up nurseries, breastfeeding rooms, literacy classes, cultural amateur schools, and various recreational and sports organizations. About 2.18 million cooperative members across the country have already enrolled in schools, of which 70% are studying in literacy classes, 26% are studying in higher primary schools, and 4% are studying in junior high schools.

　　Handicraft laborers were looked down upon in the old society. But now, handicraft laborers have turned over politically and can control their own destiny. Members not only run their own affairs in the cooperative, but some are also elected as people's representatives or CPPCC members, directly participating in national affairs.

　　China's handicraft industry has a history of thousands of years. Why were we able to basically complete the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production in just eight years, allowing the vast number of handicraft laborers to turn over politically, economically, and culturally, begin to get rid of poverty, and move towards prosperity and civilization? Obviously, without the correct leadership of the Party and the great assistance of the state, these would have been fundamentally impossible.

　　Because handicraft laborers in old China were poor and suffered all kinds of oppression and exploitation, they have a rich revolutionary tradition, which determines that the vast number of handicraft laborers can actively move towards socialism in the form of mass revolutionary movements under the leadership of the Party and the working class. But why couldn't handicraft laborers turn over for thousands of years? The reason is: there was no Communist Party of China at that time; there was no People's Republic of China at that time. Once we have the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution in 1949, and the superior socialist system, we have a fighting direction to move forward, and the state has given great assistance, and the development of handicraft production and handicraft cooperation has a strong ideological and material foundation.

　　Deeply Carry Out the Rectification Campaign, Cooperative Rectification, and Socialist Education Movement

　　After the high tide of the socialist revolution last spring, the socialist transformation of handicrafts in terms of the ownership of the means of production has been basically completed, but the transformation of people is far from complete. Although an absolute majority of members support the cooperative system, the influence of small producers, especially the capitalist tendencies of small owners and some wealthy independent laborers, is still very serious. In addition, some bad elements mixed in during the high tide of cooperation have not been well transformed. Moreover, handicrafts are small and scattered, and they are often relatively weak links in previous political movements. Therefore, it is of extremely important significance to carry out a rectification campaign, cooperative rectification, and socialist education movement in handicraft cooperatives without exception.

　　Judging from the situation of 100,000 cooperatives (groups) across the country: those with strong leadership, good production, and a relatively stable foundation account for about 30% of the total; those with weak leadership, generally normal production, and basically able to stand on their feet account for about 55% of the total; those with very weak leadership, chaotic production, including individual cooperatives controlled and usurped by bad elements, account for about 15% of the total.

　　Judging from the political and ideological situation of more than 5 million members across the country: there are 2 million old members who joined the cooperative before the high tide; there are more than 3 million new members who joined the cooperative during the high tide. Old members generally have better components and have been educated through previous cooperative rectifications and various political movements, and generally have a higher socialist awareness; new members have also improved their socialist awareness after joining the cooperative, after undergoing economic reorganization, wage adjustment, and the increased production and conservation movement, but this is very uneven.

　　According to typical surveys in various regions, handicraft workers and poor independent laborers account for more than 70% of the total number of new and old members. They suffered from exploitation, oppression, and unemployment in the old society. After joining the cooperative, they deeply feel the warmth of the cooperative, are firm in their confidence in running the cooperative, and can generally work hard and strive to maintain the interests of the cooperative. However, they more or less retain or accept the ideological influence of small producers, and often show individualistic, liberalistic, and economistic ideological tendencies in dealing with the relationship between the collective and the individual. In particular, some young workers and apprentices, because they have not experienced hardship, "do not know happiness in happiness," like to eat, drink, and play, are meticulous about wages and benefits, and are not interested in studying technology. These people are often easily lost in the sharp struggle between the two roads.

　　Wealthy independent laborers and small owners account for slightly less than 25% of the total number of members. They mostly own a certain amount of means of production and have varying degrees of wage labor exploitation and commercial profits. Among them, wealthy independent laborers and small owners who have risen from independent laborers mostly master major technologies and participate in production labor; small owners who do not come from handicraft laborers generally do not master technology and do not participate in major labor. Although these people are not large in number, their trends have a considerable impact on the socialist transformation of handicrafts. They have roughly three different attitudes towards cooperatives:

　　Some people used to own fewer means of production, had a lighter degree of exploitation, had abnormal production, had unstable lives, and were in danger of declining or going bankrupt in the event of natural disasters or man-made misfortunes. Their income after joining the cooperative is generally slightly higher than before joining the cooperative. Although they also know that working outside can sometimes "make a fortune," they always feel that the cooperative is "worry-free" and "reliable" and are unwilling to leave. Most of these people support the cooperative, are actively involved in production, and can enthusiastically pass on their skills.

　　Others used to own more means of production, rarely participated in labor themselves, and could rely on wage labor exploitation, commercial speculation, and other income to maintain a relatively affluent life. Among them, some people have an extremely strong concept of making money and have a strong capitalist desire. After joining the cooperative, their lives have declined due to the abolition of exploitative income, and they are very dissatisfied with the cooperative. Those who run to the "free market," engage in "underground factories," and make the loudest noise about withdrawing from the cooperative are these people.

　　The above two types of people are relatively few among wealthy independent laborers and small owners. The largest number of people are another group of people standing in the middle. These people mostly have a small amount of means of production and certain skills. Their labor income after joining the cooperative has slightly decreased or remained unchanged. They used to be greatly affected by seasonality in production and operation. The so-called "when rape flowers are yellow, blacksmith masters dominate; when snowflakes fall, blacksmith masters starve" is a portrayal of such people. They also want to make money. Seeing the speculative lives of some individual households who "earn one or two hundred yuan by shaking their arms," they are eager to try. Although they know that "three months of peach blossoms are red for a while" and are very unreliable, they also want to "make a fortune" while it is "red." These people join the cooperative "following the crowd," and after joining the cooperative, they still "step on two boats" and vacillate.

　　In handicraft cooperatives, there are also some original landlords, puppet military and political officials, reactionary party and group backbones, special agents, bandits, hooligans, local bullies, etc., who took the opportunity to mix in during the high tide of cooperation. These people account for about 2% of the total number of members. After joining the cooperative, some of them can be honest and willing to transform themselves in labor and start anew; but a considerable number of them are dishonest. They hate the Party, hate the new society, and resent the cooperative. They try their best to sabotage it and make the cooperative deteriorate.

　　The vast majority of grassroots cadres in handicraft cooperatives are good. However, due to lack of experience, some people have moved the patriarchal style of small producers into the cooperative, doing everything on their own, forcing orders, and so on; some people often pursue profits from the perspective of the cooperative's position and develop capitalist management methods.

　　The above situation fully illustrates that the question of who will win on the political and ideological fronts within handicraft cooperatives has not been fundamentally resolved. Therefore, according to the Party Central Committee's call for all-people rectification, it is very necessary to conduct a planned rectification campaign, cooperative rectification, and socialist education movement in the handicraft cooperative system.

　　At present, under the direct leadership of Party committees at all levels, this movement has been launched one after another. Except for a few areas that are still piloting, most areas have completed the pilot and are unfolding in batches. The development of the movement is basically healthy. In cooperatives that have undergone great debates on the two roads, the socialist consciousness of the members has been rapidly improved, labor discipline has been greatly strengthened, there are more rationalization proposals than at any other time, and the style of cadres has also been significantly improved. Problems that could not be solved for a long time in production have been solved, and a new atmosphere has emerged.

　　Handicraft laborers are small producers, and their ideological transformation is a long-term and arduous process of self-education. Carrying out the rectification campaign, cooperative rectification, and socialist education movement in handicraft cooperatives is essentially a matter of enabling the vast number of handicraft laborers to accept socialist transformation. According to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the experience of pilot projects in various regions, the rectification of handicraft cooperatives should be combined with the rectification of cooperatives. The rectification campaign and cooperative rectification should achieve three goals: first, destroy capitalism and establish socialism, and consolidate the socialist political and ideological front; second, rectify the organization, establish and consolidate the leading advantage of handicraft workers and poor independent laborers; third, change the style of cadres, improve management, and earnestly implement the policy of democratic cooperative management and thrifty cooperative management. Only by combining ideological education and transformation, organizational rectification, and improvement of management systems can we further develop production, consolidate and improve handicraft cooperatives.

　　In order to achieve the above goals, the following issues must be noted:

　　First, in the rectification campaign, cooperative rectification, and socialist education movement, we must rely on handicraft workers and poor independent laborers, fully develop their enthusiasm for taking the socialist road, unite relatively wealthy and skilled members, expose and criticize the capitalist tendencies of the original small owners and some wealthy independent laborers, and stop the destructive activities of some of them and other bad elements. Only in this way can we unite the largest number of members and ensure the healthy development of the movement. In the movement, we must also rely on old members with longer work experience, better skills, and more political education, and use their rich production and life experience, their class consciousness, and their spirit of hard work to educate new members and young apprentices.

　　Second, the situation of handicraft cooperatives is complex and the foundation is uneven. The methods and steps of the rectification campaign, cooperative rectification, and socialist education movement must be adapted to local conditions and cooperatives by Party committees at all levels according to specific circumstances. It is impossible and unnecessary to demand uniformity. In cities, old cooperatives and large cooperatives with better foundations and centralized production, and cooperative factories can generally refer to the practices of state-owned factories and mines; in rural areas, because they are closely related to rural areas, they can generally refer to the practices of agricultural cooperatives. However, no matter which method is adopted, it should be closely combined with the characteristics of handicrafts, firmly believe in the majority of the masses, boldly mobilize the masses, and earnestly implement the working methods of the mass line. According to the experience of pilot projects in various regions, the unfolding of a rectification movement in a cooperative can be roughly divided into four stages: full airing of views, focusing on rectification and improvement, great debate, and consolidation and construction. These four stages are divided according to their main content and characteristics. In the actual development process, they are mutually infiltrated, complementary, and cross-conducted, and cannot be clearly divided. Full airing of views must be rectified and improved at the same time, and rectification and improvement are a continuation of airing of views. Airing of views and rectification should still be carried out in the great debate. The entire process of the movement is the process of "airing, improving, debating, and building," which is also the process of comprehensive cooperative rectification.

　　Before the start of the movement, it is necessary to deeply understand the situation and make various preparations. After the start of the movement, it is necessary to repeatedly explain the policies, break ideological concerns, and adopt various forms convenient for the masses to air their views, such as big-character posters, group meetings, forums, discussion meetings, opinion boxes, and individual heart-to-heart talks, to mobilize all members to air their views together. There is no need and should not be any red tape.

　　When the problems within the cooperative have been basically aired, it can be turned to the stage of focusing on rectification and improvement. We should accept all correct opinions of the masses, strike while the iron is hot, boldly improve, resolutely improve, and thoroughly improve. In practice, we should follow the principle of "easy first, difficult later," and "pick up sesame seeds first, then hug watermelons," and solve about 80%-90% of the problems that are relatively easy to solve first, so as to further promote airing of views with practical actions of rectification and improvement.

　　When airing of views is relatively deep and the problems that can be improved have been basically improved, the masses can be organized to conduct great debates on some major issues, especially the issue of the two roads, to eliminate the influence of capitalism and establish socialist thinking. The debate should generally start with the issues with the most opinions from the masses and vague understanding, and clarify right and wrong and improve awareness through presenting facts, reasoning, recalling, comparing, and detailed calculations, using the masses' own personal experiences, so as to expose various erroneous ideas, isolate anti-socialist elements and other bad elements, and give all members a profound socialist education. Resolute struggle should be carried out against a few elements who adhere to the capitalist stand, oppose socialism, and sabotage cooperatives, but any simplification and rude practices should be prevented. Legal sanctions can be requested from the government for current counter-revolutionary elements and bad elements who have seriously destructive behaviors.

　　After the great debate has achieved basic victory, it enters the stage of consolidation and construction. At this time, efforts should be concentrated on solving various major problems within the cooperative, such as rectifying the membership, strengthening Party and League organizations, re-electing the board of directors and the supervisory board, revising and abolishing all rules and regulations that affect production, affect unity, and affect the enthusiasm of members, and establishing and improving the necessary production management and political education work systems, so as to consolidate the results of the movement organizationally and systematically.

　　Third, during the rectification campaign and cooperative rectification, not only should normal production order be maintained, so that rectification and production are not delayed, but also a favorable foundation should be laid for the development of production. On the basis of the victory of the rectification campaign and cooperative rectification, it is necessary to do a good job in production planning, continue to widely and deeply carry out the increased production and conservation movement, and further consolidate the cooperative.

　　The rectification campaign, cooperative rectification, and socialist education movement are the most profound class education for every handicraft laborer, and will be the most thorough rectification for handicraft cooperatives. Therefore, in this rectification, we must ensure that no cooperative (group) is missed, persist to the end, and carry out the movement deeply and thoroughly.

　　Who to Serve? How to Serve?

　　Handicraft cooperatives must clarify their production and service direction and business policy. This is a major issue related to who to serve and how to serve.

　　Handicrafts belong to local industry, and its service direction should be to face the countryside, first serve agricultural production, and also serve the needs of urban and rural people's lives, national industrial construction, and export needs. Practice has proven that this service direction is completely correct.

　　Of the industrial products needed in rural areas, about 60% are currently handicraft products; for a considerable period of time before the realization of agricultural mechanization, handicrafts are also the main supplier of various small farm tools, tools, and building materials. We should actively do a good job in serving the agricultural economy. Handicraft cooperatives should promptly produce and supply various applicable small farm tools, furniture, and various daily necessities according to the actual needs of local agriculture and people's lives, plan to trial-produce improved farm tools, go to the countryside and mountains, strengthen farm tool repair and assembly work, use local materials, expand production avenues, and actively support mountainous areas and water conservancy construction.

　　In the handicraft industry, more than 70% of the output value is the production of consumer goods. Handicraft production accounts for a considerable proportion of the cotton cloth, paper, daily necessities, furniture, utensils, etc. needed by the people every day. In handicrafts, there are also some hardware foundry, hydropower installation, building materials, and other industries that directly serve industrial and mining enterprises, transportation, and basic construction. Arts and crafts and some handicraft products are also important export goods for our country. Various repair service industries all over the cities and countryside are indispensable for the daily lives of the vast number of people. While serving agricultural production, we should also pay attention to giving play to the active role of these aspects.

　　In order to enable handicraft cooperatives to better serve all aspects of society, according to the experience of recent years, the following four tasks should be done well:

　　First, we must comprehensively implement the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" in production and operation, proceed from the needs of 600 million people, and plan to actively produce a large number of high-quality, applicable, and inexpensive handicraft products to meet the ever-increasing needs of society. This is a socialist business policy. By implementing this policy, the service direction of handicraft cooperatives will be correct, the development of production will be based on a reliable foundation, and the lives of members will also be improved. Some people do not verbally oppose this policy, but they are implementing another policy, which is the capitalist business policy. Implementing such a policy not only damages the interests of the state and the people, but also brings adverse consequences such as product backlog and rework waste to the cooperative itself, and also directly affects the income of members. In the past few years, the lessons of some cooperatives have clearly proven this.

　　The quality of handicraft products and the quality of service are the primary issues for whether handicraft cooperatives can gain the trust of consumers, and are also the central link in implementing the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical." Therefore, after handicraft cooperation, it is necessary to give play to the superior conditions of collective production, so that product quality and service quality are continuously improved, and production costs are continuously reduced.

　　"More, faster, better, and more economical" are mutually restrictive and inseparable. We must comprehensively implement this policy. It is wrong to only seek more and faster, without regard to better and more economical; for the sake of better and more economical, without regard to more and faster, it cannot meet social needs. Handicraft production should be made more and faster under the conditions of better and more economical.

　　Second, we must preserve and carry forward the various good traditions of the original handicrafts in production and operation. The characteristics of handicrafts are locality, dispersion, simple equipment, flexible operation, and diverse products and service methods. Because of this, handicrafts have a special role in meeting the diverse and ever-changing needs of the vast number of people, and these roles are difficult to replace by large industries. Small products for social needs should not only not be eliminated, but also should be continuously improved in terms of product varieties and designs according to the needs of residents. The original service methods that facilitate residents, such as renovation and repair, custom-made, street wandering, and door-to-door service, must be preserved. At present, the ideas and practices that exist in some cooperatives and members, such as being willing to do batch work, not willing to do scattered work; being willing to do large products, not willing to do small products; being willing to do manufacturing, not willing to do repair; being willing to do industrial building materials, not willing to do small farm tools; being willing to wait for customers to come to the door, not willing to do mobile services, etc., are all one-sided and wrong.

　　In order to better play the small and flexible role of handicrafts, experience has proven that handicraft cooperative organizations should adopt a variety of organizational forms according to industry characteristics and social needs. In addition to a small number of large cooperatives that need to be centrally produced, it is generally suitable to be smaller and more dispersed. Production organizational forms that are currently unreasonable, especially multi-industry mixed cooperatives and large cooperatives that handle everything from the county to the industry, should be rationally adjusted according to the specific situation.

　　Third, we must strengthen the planning of production and operation, and oppose and overcome blindness. From a general point of view, with the continuous development and improvement of socialist construction and people's living standards, the needs of all aspects for handicraft products are very large and are constantly increasing. This requires cooperatives to actively tap potential and increase production. However, market needs and raw material supply are different in different periods, different regions, and different industries. Therefore, it is necessary to determine different requirements under the unified leadership and overall arrangement of local Party and government organs and according to different situations. For example, some products are needed by society and there is no problem with raw material supply, and production should be increased as much as possible; for some products that are needed by society but there are difficulties in raw material supply, efforts should be made to solve the raw material problem in order to seek increased production. As for those industries with insufficient production tasks, the flexibility and adaptability of handicrafts should be brought into play, the variety of products should be changed properly, the old repair business should be expanded, and the service direction should be shifted to maintain normal production. Between handicrafts and large industries, between handicraft specialties and agricultural and sideline industries, between advanced regions and backward regions, and between handicraft cooperatives in the same industry, we should also do a good job in the planning balance of raw material supply, product sales, and organized production under the leadership of local Party and government organs and higher-level federations of cooperatives, so as to seek mutual support and development.

　　In supply and marketing operations, we should closely rely on state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives, abide by the state's unified purchase and sales system, obey the state's market management and price management, and oppose speculative behaviors such as substituting inferior products for good ones, raising prices, lowering prices, and rushing to purchase raw materials. The needs of state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives for processed orders and products selected and purchased should be met as much as possible. The scope of self-production and self-sale will not be expanded in the future. In the future, the purchase of raw materials from other places and the sale of products from other places, if state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives have difficulties in operating, should generally be operated or organized by the county (city) federation of cooperatives. Raw materials produced locally and products sold locally should be operated by grassroots cooperatives themselves. Export products should be directly contracted with export companies by handicraft federations or grassroots cooperatives. In this way, the enthusiasm and flexibility of grassroots cooperative operations can be fully brought into play, and the "flying all over the sky" of salespersons can be prevented, which has an adverse impact on market stability due to mutual competition for purchase and sales.

　　Fourth, in order to fully exploit the production potential of handicrafts, with the development of national industrialization, some links of some handicrafts can be gradually mechanized or semi-mechanized as needed and possible to develop production. However, due to China's large population, the technical transformation of handicrafts must be considered in terms of labor employment and investment efficiency. At present, efforts should be focused on improving existing manual tools, and old machines replaced by state-owned factories should be used as much as possible. It is wrong to blindly pursue mechanization regardless of subjective and objective conditions. Some cooperatives need to develop production and have funds themselves, and should appropriately add equipment and carry out basic construction under the unified planning of local Party and government organs, based on the principles of small investment, fast construction, and high returns.

　　Implement the Policy of Democratic Cooperative Management

　　Handicraft cooperatives are collective economic organizations of handicraft laboring masses. Their property belongs to all members, and the internal relations are mutual assistance and cooperation. Only by implementing democratic cooperative management according to the principle of democratic centralism, and members truly being masters of their own affairs, can all positive factors be mobilized, contradictions be resolved, difficulties be overcome, and cooperatives be run well.

　　In recent years, handicraft cooperatives have explored some experience in implementing democratic cooperative management. Through democratic cooperative management, the contradictions between members and cadres, and between members and members have been adjusted, internal unity has been strengthened, and the development of production has been promoted. Especially for some old cooperatives organized before the high tide, the achievements are even more significant after multiple cooperative rectifications. However, the policy of "democratic cooperative management" has not been earnestly implemented by all cooperatives. Especially for new cooperatives organized during the high tide and old cooperatives with too many new members, the education of democratic centralism has not been able to keep up for a while. Many members still have a strong habit of small producers, and do not understand or do not fully understand the nature of cooperatives and the rights and obligations of members. Most of the existing cooperative cadres were selected from grassroots cooperatives. They generally work diligently for the cooperative, but due to the short time of leading the cooperative and the lack of experience in democratic cooperative management, there are still many problems. Some cooperatives are too large, have too many industries, have scattered factories, and have too many management levels, which affects the quality of democratic life. Some cooperatives have unsound democratic management systems, do not convene members' congresses (or members' representative congresses) for a long time, do not report work and publicize accounts to members, and many major issues within the cooperative are not discussed and decided by members, or even if they are discussed, it is just a formality. Many cadres do not understand or do not understand how to follow the mass line. They force orders and act arbitrarily in their work, causing serious detachment from the masses. The tendencies of individualism, liberalism, and extreme democracy are relatively common among many members. Due to the above situation, continuing to implement the policy of "democratic cooperative management" and deeply conducting education on democratic centralism are still major tasks for us at present.

　　How to implement democratic cooperative management? According to the experience of running cooperatives in various regions, first of all, cooperative cadres should put down their airs and establish a democratic style. Cadres who are separated from production should take some time to participate in physical labor in the workshop and make it a system to persist in carrying it out, so as to often contact the masses and solve various problems in production in a timely manner. This is an effective method to overcome subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism. By doing so, members will regard cadres as "their own people" and be able to tell the truth; cooperative cadres will also have personal experience in leading production, and problems will be easier to solve. When dealing with various contradictions within the cooperative, the formula of unity-criticism-unity should be adopted, and education and persuasion should be adopted, rather than commandism and suppression.

　　动员一切积极因素，为进一步发展生产、巩固和提高手工业合作组织而奋斗！
　　白如冰在中华全国手工业合作社第一次社员代表大会上的报告摘要
    从个体到集体的伟大转变
    我国的手工业非常发达。它的行业复杂，产品多样，分布面广。它和城乡人民的生产、生活有着密切不可分离的关系。1956年手工业年产值约占我国工农业总产值的9.1％，占工业总产值的16.6％。这就说明，手工业在我国国民经济中占有相当重要的地位。
    几年以来，党在优先发展重工业的同时，大力扶持手工业生产，充分发挥它在国民经济中的积极作用。
    发展手工业生产，有两条不同的道路。一条是资本主义道路：就是手工业劳动者的命运掌握在资本家、投机商人和高利贷剥削者的手里，少数人发财、多数人贫困破产的道路。另一条道路是社会主义道路：就是广大手工业劳动者，在工人阶级的领导下，自己掌握自己的命运，组织起来，摆脱剥削，发展生产，共同富裕的道路。历史的事实已充分证明，这是一条正确的光明大道。
    我国手工业合作化运动的发展是迅速的、健康的。
    特别是1955年10月毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告发表以后，我们在党中央和国务院的领导下，于12月间召开了第五次全国手工业生产合作会议，检查了领导落后于群众的保守思想，研究和制订了手工业社会主义改造的全面规划。1956年1月，在全国社会主义改造高潮的推动下，手工业劳动者成行业、成地区地要求组织起来，从城市开始，迅速形成全国范围的手工业合作化高潮。高潮至今，全国已有五百多万人组织到十万个手工业合作社（组）中来，占由手工业部门改造人数的92％。其他的手工业劳动者，大部分也都参加了农业生产合作社，少数参加了公私合营企业。这样，手工业劳动者从个体经济走向集体经济的伟大变革，就取得了决定性的胜利。这个具有历史意义的胜利，彻底摧毁了在手工业领域内不断产生资本主义的物质基础。我国几千年来手工业劳动者受压迫、受剥削的悲惨历史，从此一去永不复返了。
    现在，我们来看看手工业合作化以后的巨大优越性。
    第一、由于合作化，变个体经济为集体经济，手工业生产大大发展了。
    解放以前，手工业生产最盛的年代是1936年。但在抗日战争和解放战争的年代里，由于帝国主义侵略和国民党反动统治的严重摧残，手工业产值逐年下降，到解放前夕的1949年，仅及1936年的42.7％。解放以后，手工业生产年年上升。1956年手工业总产值比1952年增长了60％，超过1936年产值的54.6％，提前一年完成了第一个五年计划的1957年的产值指标。在第一个五年计划的前四年中，手工业生产平均每年增长了12.4％。如以1956年的产值与1952年比较，生产资料的生产，增加93％，消费资料的生产增加了51％。1957年手工业合作组织的产值预计可比1956年又增长10.3％。1956年手工业生产合作社每人平均产值为二千零八十六元，比1952年提高了47.9％，四年中每年平均增长10.35％。1956年比1936年，几乎超过了二倍。
    生产的发展还表现在产品质量的不断提高，成本和价格的逐步降低，以及品种花色的改进和创新。
    手工业生产的迅速发展，是合作化的必然结果。这是因为：（1）合作化以后，把原有的个体私有制改变为合作社集体所有制，把旧的、家长制的封建关系和剥削关系，改变为新的、民主的互助合作关系，解除了生产关系对生产力的束缚。（2）合作化以后，把原有个体生产改变为集体生产，就有可能在生产上实行分工协作，改进落后的生产技术，提高劳动生产率，并在此基础上，逐步地扩大公共积累，逐步地由手工生产改变为半机械化、机械化生产。（3）合作化以后，能够集中较大的人力、物力和财力，并且和国营、合作社营商业建立了经济联系，逐步地加强了计划性，克服了生产上的盲目性和不稳定性。
    第二、由于合作化，发展了生产，手工业才在适应社会需要方面，发挥了积极的作用，成为国营工业的有力助手。
    在为农业生产服务方面：仅以为农民生产的农具一项来说，1955年全国手工业合作社（组）生产了一亿一千万件，1956年即增加到二亿三千万件，平均给每个农业社制造了农具三百多件。各地还根据生产季节、耕作习惯等情况，生产了大批的改良农具和新式农具。同时，各地手工业合作社还普遍地组织了农具修配网。仅据河北、江苏等十四省的不完全统计，共建立固定的和流动的农具修配站、组达三万二千五百多个，为农民修配的农具数以亿计。
    在为城乡人民生活需要服务方面：手工业合作社（组）生产了大量的衣帽鞋袜、织锦绣花、木器家具、玻璃陶瓷等日用品，供应人民需要。生活服务和各项修理业务，在经过经济改组以后，不但保存下来了，而且服务质量还有所提高。
    在为工业生产和基本建设服务方面：1956年全国手工业合作社（组）生产砖瓦四十三亿块，石灰一百六十八万吨，还有大量的工业用配件、小五金、铁路道钉等等，不计其数。
    在提供出口物资，为国家换取外汇方面：单从工艺美术品来看，1950年到1956年的出口总额即达三亿三千余万元。用这笔外汇可以购买钢轨约一百万吨。
    手工业合作社为国家扩大税源和提供建设资金，也是一个重要的方面。在第一个五年计划期间，手工业合作组织向国家缴纳的税款，除减免优待外，共七亿多元。
    第三、由于合作化，手工业劳动者的物质、文化生活，也在生产发展的基础上，有了相应的改善。
    在旧中国，贫困破产是手工业劳动者的必然命运。但在组织起来以后，情况就大大改变了。1956年全国90％左右的社员比入社以前增加了劳动收入，其中生产合作社每个职工年平均工资达到三百四十七元，比1952年提高了66％。全国大中城市及部分县（市）手工业合作组织，实行了医疗补助，有些社实行了公费医疗，病假、产假期间还有工资补助。不少合作社还设立了托儿所、哺乳室、扫盲班、文化业余学校和各种文娱体育组织。全国已经入学的社员约计二百一十八万人，其中有70％在扫盲班学习，26％读高小，4％读初中。
    手工业劳动者在旧社会是被人瞧不起的。但现在，手工业劳动者在政治上翻了身，自己能掌握自己的命运了。社员不仅在合作社中当家作主，而且有的还被选为人民代表或政协委员，直接参与了国家大事。
    我国手工业有几千年的历史，为什么我们能够在短短的八年之内，基本上完成生产资料所有制的社会主义改造，使广大手工业劳动者在政治上、经济上、文化上翻了身，开始摆脱贫困，走向富裕和文明呢？很明显，如果没有党的正确领导和国家的巨大援助，这些都是根本不可能的。
    由于旧社会我国的手工业劳动者穷，受尽压迫和剥削，因此富有革命传统，这就决定了广大手工业劳动者，能够在党和工人阶级的领导下，以群众革命运动的形式，积极地走向社会主义。但是，为什么几千年来，手工业劳动者都翻不了身呢？原因就是：那时候没有中国共产党；那时候没有中华人民共和国。而一旦我们有了共产党和毛主席的英明领导，有了1949年中国人民革命的伟大胜利，有了社会义主的优越的社会制度，我们就有了一往直前的奋斗方向，有了国家的巨大援助，手工业生产和手工业合作化的发展，就有了雄厚的思想基础和物质基础。
    深入开展整风、整社和社会主义教育运动
    经过去年春天的社会主义革命高潮，手工业在生产资料所有制上的社会主义改造已经基本上完成了，但人的改造还远没有完成。尽管社员中拥护合作制度的占绝对优势，但小生产者的影响，特别是小业主和部分富裕独立劳动者的资本主义倾向还很严重，合作化高潮中又混进了一些坏分子，没有得到很好改造，加以手工业小而分散，在历次政治运动中往往是比较薄弱的环节。因此，在手工业合作社中毫无例外地开展一次整风、整社和社会主义教育运动，具有极其重要的意义。
    从全国十万个社（组）的情况来看：领导力量较强，生产较好，基础比较稳固的，约占总数的30％；领导力量较弱，生产一般正常，基本上能站住脚的，约占总数的55％；领导力量很弱，生产混乱，包括个别被坏分子操纵和篡夺领导权的，约占总数的15％。
    从全国五百余万社员的政治思想情况来看：高潮前入社的老社员有二百万人；高潮期间入社的新社员有三百余万人。老社员一般成分较好，又经过历次整社和各种政治运动的教育，一般都有较高的社会主义觉悟；新社员入社后，经过经济改组、工资调整和增产节约运动，社会主义觉悟也有所提高，但很不平衡。
    根据各地典型调查，手工业工人和贫苦独立劳动者，约占新老社员总数的70％以上，他们在旧社会受尽剥削、压迫和失业的痛苦，入社后深感合作社的温暖，办社信心坚定，大都能辛勤劳动，努力维护合作社的利益。但是，他们或多或少地保留或接受了小生产者的思想影响，在处理集体与个人的关系上，往往表现出个人主义、自由主义和经济主义的思想倾向。特别是有些青工、徒工，由于他们没有经历过艰难困苦，“身在福中不知福”，好吃好玩，斤斤计较于工资待遇，对钻研技术不感兴趣。这些人在两条道路的尖锐斗争中，往往容易迷失方向。
    富裕独立劳动者和小业主，约占社员总数的25％弱。他们大多占有一定数量的生产资料，有不同程度的雇工剥削和商业利润。其中富裕独立劳动者和由独立劳动者上升的小业主，大多掌握主要技术，参加生产劳动；非手工业劳动者出身的小业主，则一般不掌握技术，不参加主要劳动。这些人，人数虽然不多，但他们的动向，对于手工业社会主义改造事业却有相当的影响。他们对于合作社的态度，大致有三种不同表现：
    有些人过去占有生产资料较少，剥削程度较轻，生产不正常，生活不安定，遇到天灾人祸就有下降或破产的危险。他们入社后的收入，大体比入社前稍有提高。他们虽也知道在外干活，有时可以“捞一把”；但总觉得合作社“省心”、“牢靠”，不愿离开。这些人大多拥护合作社，生产积极，并能热心传授技艺。
    又有些人过去生产资料较多，自己很少参加劳动，可以凭借雇工剥削、商业投机等收入，来维持比较富裕的生活。其中有些人发财的观念极重，有浓厚的资本主义欲望，他们加入合作社后，由于取消了剥削收入，生活有所下降，对合作社非常不满，跑“自由市场”，搞“地下工厂”，闹退社最凶的就是这些人。
    以上两种人，在富裕独立劳动者和小业主中间，比较是少数。最多数的是站在中间的另一批人。这些人大多有少量的生产资料和一定的技术，入社后劳动收入略有减少或者不增不减。他们过去在生产经营上，因受季节性的影响，变化很大，所谓“油菜花黄，铁匠师傅称霸王；雪花落地，铁匠师傅饿肚皮”，就是这种人的写照。他们也想发财，看到某些个体户那种“晃晃膀子，也赚一、两百元”的投机生涯，就跃跃欲试，虽然明知道“三月桃花一时红”，很不可靠，却也想趁“红”的时候“捞一把”。这种人入社是“随大流”，入了社还是“脚踏两只船”，摇摆不定。
    在手工业合作社中，还有一些原来的地主、伪军政官吏、反动党团骨干、特务、土匪、流氓、地痞等，在合作化高潮中乘机混了进来，这些人约占社员总数的2％左右。他们入社以后，有一部分人能够老老实实，愿意在劳动中改造自己，重新作人；但他们中间有相当多的人是不老实的，他们仇视党，憎恨新社会，对合作社怀恨在心，千方百计地加以破坏，使合作社变质。
    手工业合作社的基层干部绝大多数是好的。但由于缺乏经验，有些人把小生产者的家长制作风搬到合作社里来，包办代替，强迫命令；有些人往往从合作社的本位观点出发，追逐利润，发展资本主义的经营方式。
    上述情况充分地说明了，在手工业合作社内部，政治战线和思想战线上谁战胜谁的问题，还没有从根本上得到解决。因此，根据党中央关于全民整风的号召，在手工业合作系统中，有计划地进行一次整风、整社和社会主义教育运动，是非常必要的。
    目前，在各级党委的直接领导下，这个运动已经先后开展起来。除少数地区还在试点外，多数地区试点已经完毕，正在分批展开。运动的发展基本上是健康的。凡是经过两条道路大辩论的合作社，社员的社会主义觉悟都迅速提高，劳动纪律大大加强，合理化建议比任何时期都多，干部作风也有了显著的改进，生产中长期不能解决的问题解决了，出现了新的气象。
    手工业劳动者是小生产者，他们的思想改造是一个长期的、艰巨的自我教育过程。在手工业合作社内开展整风、整社和社会主义教育运动，实质上就是使广大手工业劳动者接受社会主义改造的问题。根据党中央指示和各地试点经验，手工业合作社的整风应该和整社相结合。整风、整社要达到三个目的：第一，破资本主义，立社会主义，巩固社会主义的政治思想阵地；第二，整顿组织，树立和巩固手工业工人和贫苦独立劳动者的领导优势；第三，转变干部作风，改善经营管理，切实贯彻执行民主办社、勤俭办社的方针。只有把思想方面的教育改造、组织上的整顿和管理制度上的改进结合起来，才能进一步发展生产、巩固和提高手工业合作社。
    为了达到上述目的，必须注意以下几个问题：
    第一、在整风、整社和社会主义教育运动中，必须依靠手工业工人和贫苦独立劳动者，充分发扬他们走社会主义道路的积极性，团结比较富裕的有技术的社员，揭露和批判原来的小业主和一部分富裕独立劳动者的资本主义倾向，制止他们当中某些人和其他坏分子的破坏活动。只有这样，我们才能够团结社员的最大多数，保证运动的健康发展。在运动中，还必须依靠工龄较长、技术较好、受政治教育较多的老社员，用他们丰富的生产和生活经验、他们的阶级觉悟和艰苦奋斗的精神，来教育新社员和青年徒工。
    第二、手工业合作社情况复杂，基础不一，在整风、整社和社会主义教育运动的方法步骤上，必须由各地党委根据具体情况，因地因社制宜，不可能也不必要强求一致。在城市，有些基础较好、集中生产的老社、大社与合作工厂，一般可以参照国营厂矿的做法；在农村，由于和农村关系比较密切，一般可以参照农业合作社的做法。但不论采取那一种做法，都应紧紧地结合手工业的特点，坚定地相信群众的多数，放手发动群众，切实贯彻群众路线的工作方法。根据各地试点经验，在一个社开展整风运动，大体上可分为大鸣大放、着重整改、大辩论和巩固建设四个阶段。这四个阶段是就其主要内容和特点来划分的，在实际发展过程中是互相渗透，互为补充，交叉进行的，不能截然划分。大鸣大放一定要边整边改，边整边改又是鸣放的继续，大辩论中仍然要进行鸣放和整改。整个运动的过程，就是“放、改、辩、建”的过程，也就是全面整社的过程。
    运动开始以前，必须深入了解情况，做好各项准备工作。运动开始以后，就要反复交代政策，打破思想顾虑，并采取大字报、小组会、座谈会、讨论会、意见箱、个别谈心等多种多样便利群众鸣放的形式，动员全体社员一齐鸣放，不需要也不应该订什么清规戒律。
    当社内问题基本上都放出来的时候，即可转入着重整改的阶段。我们应该接受群众一切正确的意见，趁热打铁，大胆地改、坚决地改、彻底地改。在做法上，应该根据“先易后难”，“先拣芝麻、后抱西瓜”的原则，把约占80％—90％比较容易解决的问题先行解决，以整改的实际行动进一步推动鸣放。
    在鸣放比较深透、能改的问题大体上又都改了的情况下，就可以有计划地对一些重大问题，特别是两条道路的问题，组织群众进行大辩论，消除资本主义的影响，树立社会主义的思想。辩论一般应该从群众意见最多、而又认识模糊的问题开始，通过摆事实、讲道理、回忆、对比、算细账，以群众自己的切身体会来弄清是非，提高觉悟，从而揭露各种错误思想，孤立反社会主义分子和其他坏分子，使全体社员都受到一次深刻的社会主义教育。对于少数坚持资本主义立场、反对社会主义、破坏合作社的分子，应当进行坚决的斗争，但要防止任何简单化和粗暴的做法。对现行反革命分子和有严重破坏行为的坏分子，可以要求政府给予法律制裁。
    在大辩论取得基本胜利以后，就进入巩固建设阶段。这时候应该集中力量解决合作社内各项重大问题，诸如整顿社员队伍，加强党团组织，改选理事会和监事会，修改和废除一切影响生产、影响团结、影响社员积极性的各种规章制度，建立和健全必要的生产管理和政治教育工作制度，从组织上和制度上巩固运动的成果。
    第三、在整风、整社期间，不仅要保持正常的生产秩序，作到整风和生产两不误，而且要为发展生产打下有利的基础。在整风、整社胜利的基础上，必须搞好生产规划，继续广泛、深入地开展增产节约运动，进一步把合作社巩固起来。
    整风、整社和社会主义教育运动，对每一个手工业劳动者是一次最深刻的阶级教育，对于手工业合作社将是一次最彻底的整顿，因此在这次整风中，要做到不漏掉一个社（组），坚持到底，把运动搞深搞透。
    为谁服务？怎样服务？
    手工业合作社必须明确自己的生产服务方向和经营方针。这是关系到为谁服务和怎样服务的重大问题。
    手工业属于地方工业，它的服务方向，应该是面向农村，首先为农业生产服务，同时为城乡人民生活需要、国家工业建设和出口需要服务。实践证明，这个服务方向是完全正确的。
    农村所需要的工业品中，目前有60％左右是手工业产品；在农业机械化实现以前相当长的时间内，手工业又是各式小农具、工具和建筑材料的主要供应者。我们应该积极做好为农业经济服务的工作。手工业合作社应当根据当地农业和人民生活的实际需要，及时生产供应各种适用的小农具、家具和各式日用品，有计划地试制改良农具，并且下乡上山，加强农具修配工作，就地取材，扩大生产门路，积极支援山区和水利建设。
    手工业行业中有70％以上的产值是消费资料的生产，人民日常需要的棉布、纸张、日用百货、家具、用具等，手工业生产都占有相当的比重。手工业中，还有一部分五金翻砂、水电安装、建筑材料等行业，直接为工矿企业、交通运输和基本建设服务。工艺美术品和一部分手工业产品，又是我国出口的重要物资。遍布城乡的各种修理服务行业，更是广大人民日常生活所不可缺少的。在为农业生产服务的同时，也应该注意发挥这几方面的积极作用。
    为了使手工业合作社能够更好地为社会各方面服务，根据几年来的经验，应该做好以下四项工作：
    第一、必须在生产经营上全面地贯彻执行“又多、又快、又好、又省”的方针，从六亿人民的需要出发，有计划地积极生产大量品质优良、式样适用、价钱便宜的手工业产品，来适应社会日益增长的需要。这是一条社会主义的经营方针。实行了这一方针，手工业合作社的服务方向就端正了，生产的发展就会建立在可靠的基础上，社员的生活也会得到改善。有些人口头上不反对这一方针，他们执行的却是另外一条方针，那就是资本主义的经营方针，实行这样的方针，既损害了国家和人民的利益，又给合作社本身带来产品积压、返工浪费等恶果，也直接影响社员收入。这一点，过去几年中，有些合作社的教训已经清楚地证明了。
    手工业产品质量和服务质量的好坏，是手工业合作社能否取得消费者信任的首要问题，也是贯彻执行“多、快、好、省”方针的中心环节。因此，手工业合作化以后，要发挥集体生产的优越条件，使产品质量和服务质量不断地提高，生产成本不断地降低。
    “多、快、好、省”是互相制约不可分割的，我们必须全面地贯彻执行这个方针。只求多、快，不顾好、省是不对的；为了好、省，不顾多、快，也不能适应社会需要。应该在好、省的条件下，把手工业生产搞得多一些，快一些。
    第二，必须保存和发扬原有手工业在生产经营上的各种优良传统。手工业的特点就是地方性、分散性，设备简单，经营灵活，产品和服务方式多种多样。正因为这样，手工业在满足广大人民多种多样、千变万化的需要上，有着特殊的作用，这些作用是大工业所难于代替的。原有的为社会需要的小产品，不仅不能搞掉，而且还要根据居民需要，不断改进产品的品种和花色。原有翻新补旧、按样定做、串街游乡、服务上门等便利居民的服务方式，必须保存下来。目前，有些合作社和社员中存在的愿干成批活，不愿干零星活；愿干大产品，不愿干小产品；愿干制造，不愿干修理；愿干工业建筑器材，不愿干小农具；愿等客上门，不愿流动服务等等思想和做法，都是片面的、错误的。
    为了更好地发挥手工业小而灵活的作用，经验证明，手工业合作组织应该根据行业特点和社会需要，采取多种多样的组织形式，除了一部分需要集中生产的大社以外，一般地适宜于小一些、分散一些。现在生产组织形式不合理的，特别是多行业的混合社和全县全行业一竿子到底的大社，应该根据具体情况，合理地加以调整。
    第三、必须加强生产经营的计划性，反对和克服盲目性。从总的看来，随着社会主义建设和人民生活水平的不断发展和改善，各方面对手工业产品的需要是很大的，而且是不断增加的。这就要求合作社积极地挖掘潜力，增加生产。但是，在不同时期、不同地区和不同行业中，市场需要和原材料的供应情况是不一样的，因而必须在地方党政的领导和统筹安排下，根据不同情况，确定不同的要求。比如有些产品社会有需要，原料供应没有问题，应该尽可能地增加生产；有些产品社会虽然需要，而原材料供应有困难的，应当积极从解决原料问题入手，来谋求增产。至于那些生产任务不足的行业，则应当发挥手工业的灵活性和适应性，妥善地改变生产品种，扩大修旧业务，转移服务方向，来保持正常生产。在手工业和大工业之间、手工业专业和农副业之间、先进地区和落后地区之间、同行业的手工业合作社之间，我们还应该在地方党政和上级联社的领导下，做好原料供应、产品推销以及组织生产的计划平衡工作，以求得相互支持和发展。
    在供销经营中，我们应当密切依靠国营商业和供销合作社，遵守国家的统购统销制度，服从国家的市场管理和物价管理，反对以次顶好、抬价压价和抢购原料等投机行为。凡是国营商业和供销合作社需要加工定货和选购的产品，应当尽先满足他们的需要。自产自销的范围今后不再扩大。今后对外地原料的采购和外地推销的产品，如果国营商业和供销合作社经营有困难，一般应由县（市）联社经营或组织经营。本地产的原料和本地销的产品，则宜于基层社自己经营。出口的产品，应由手工业联社或基层社直接与出口公司签订合同。这样，既能充分发挥基层社经营的积极性和灵活性，又能防止业务员“满天飞”，互相争购争销，对市场稳定产生不利的影响。
    第四、为了充分发挥手工业的生产潜力，随着国家工业化的发展，应该根据需要和可能，对一部分手工业的某些环节，可以逐步地实行机械化或者半机械化，以发展生产。但由于我国人口众多，手工业的技术改造，必须结合劳动就业问题和投资效益问题，统盘考虑。目前应着重从改进现有手工工具入手，并且要尽量利用国营工厂替换下来的旧机器。不顾主客观条件，盲目追求机械化是错误的。有些合作社生产需要发展，本身又有资金，应当在当地党政的统一规划下，根据投资小、建设快、收效大的原则，适当地添制设备，进行基本建设。
    贯彻执行民主办社的方针
    手工业合作社是手工业劳动群众的集体经济组织，它的财产属于全体社员公有，内部关系是互助合作关系，只有根据民主集中制的原则，实行民主办社，社员真正当家作主，才能调动一切积极因素，解决矛盾，克服困难，办好合作社。
    几年来，手工业合作社在贯彻执行民主办社方面摸索了一些经验。通过民主办社，调节了社员和干部之间、社员和社员之间的矛盾，加强了内部的团结，推动了生产的发展。特别是高潮前组织的一些老社，经过多次整社，成绩就更为显著。但是，“民主办社”的方针，并不是所有的合作社都认真地贯彻执行了。尤其是高潮中组织起来的新社和新社员增加过多的老社，民主集中制教育一时还跟不上去，很多社员还带着浓厚的小生产者的习气，不了解或者不甚了解合作社的性质，以及社员的权利和义务。现有合作社的干部，大多是从基层社中选拔出来的，他们一般是勤勤恳恳为合作社办事，但由于领导合作社的时间短，民主办社的经验少，因而还存在着不少的问题。有些合作社由于摊子大，行业杂，厂房分散，管理层次多，影响过好民主生活。有些合作社民主管理制度不健全，长期不召开社员大会（或社员代表大会），不向社员报告工作和公布账目，社内许多重大问题不经过社员讨论和决定，或者虽经过讨论也是走走形式。不少干部不懂得或不很懂得怎样走群众路线，在工作中强迫命令，独断专行，造成严重的脱离群众。很多社员的个人主义、自由主义和极端民主化的倾向比较普遍，由于以上情况，继续贯彻执行“民主办社”的方针，深入地进行民主集中制的教育，还是我们当前一项重大的任务。
    怎样实行民主办社呢？根据各地办社的经验，首先，社干部要放下架子，树立民主作风。脱产干部应该抽出一定时间，下车间参加体力劳动，并且定为制度，坚持贯彻下去，以便经常地联系群众，及时解决生产中的各项问题。这是克服主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义的有效方法。这样做，社员就会把干部看做是“自己人”，能够把心里话讲出来了；社干部对领导生产也有亲身体会，有问题就比较容易解决了。在处理社内各项矛盾的时候，应该根据团结——批评——团结的公式，采取教育、说服的办法，而不能采取命令主义和压服的办法。对社员的一切合理建议，应该认真对待，能做的马上就做，不能做的也要向群众解释清楚。社干部自己有缺点，就应该虚心地接受群众批评，并且迅速加以改正。
    其次，要加强社会主义前途教育和社章教育，使社员树立“爱社如家、当家作主”的思想，坚定走社会主义道路的信心。加强爱国主义和集体主义的教育，使全体社员认识国家、合作社和社员个人利益的一致性，树立个人利益服从集体利益，局部利益服从整体利益，眼前利益服从长远利益的正确观点，反对和克服本位主义、个人主义和经济主义思想。加强团结互助的教育，强调全体社员应该在社会主义的前提下，团结得像一个人一样，坚决反对闹行会、搞宗派等不利团结的行为，同时并注意做好社员家属工作。加强民主集中制的教育，必须向社员讲清楚民主和集中、自由和纪律的正确关系。毛主席指示我们：“在人民内部，不可以没有自由，也不可以没有纪律；不可以没有民主，也不可以没有集中。这种民主和集中的统一，自由和纪律的统一，就是我们的民主集中制。在这个制度下，人民享受着广泛的民主和自由；同时又必须用社会主义的纪律约束自己”。当前，有些人往往是片面地认为民主办社就是只要民主，不要集中；只要自由，不要纪律，讲民主就可以不遵守劳动纪律，不服从领导，这种想法和行为，必须加以教育和纠正。
    再次，要建立和健全各项民主制度，加强社内的正常民主生活。我们应该做到：
    1、定期召开社员大会（或社员代表大会），讨论和决定社内一切重大问题。合作社的生产计划、供销安排、组织调整、收益分配、工资福利以及各项管理制度，都应提交社员大会讨论。理事会还应该经常召开各类社员（例如老师傅、青年徒工、妇女社员、少数民族社员等）的座谈会，作为社员大会的补充。
    2、民主选举和改选理事会、监事会。特别是在整风、整社胜利的基础上，每个社都应该召开社员大会，进行选举或改选。选举时，应经过社员充分酝酿，选拔社员中间觉悟高、生产好、大公无私、联系群众的优秀人物，当社干部。理事会、监事会中应保证手工业工人和贫苦独立劳动者的领导优势。思想进步、技术好的富裕独立劳动者和小业主也可适当地吸收参加。女社员和少数民族社员较多的合作社也应该吸收他们的代表人物参加理、监事会。
    3、按期公布财务账目，让社员了解社内收支和盈亏情况，监督各项开支，杜绝贪污浪费。
    4、理事会应当实行集体领导和分工负责的制度，反对少数人包办。根据合作社的具体情况，适当划分理事会和车间、小组（门市部）的职权，实行分级管理，以便在理事会的统一领导下，充分发挥车间、小组的积极性。
    5、监事会应当同社员代表和社内积极分子密切联系，充分发挥对理事会的监察作用。
    最后，基层社能否真正实现民主办社，同上级联社的领导也是分不开的。各级联社，首先是直接领导基层社（组）的县（市）联社，应该积极培养基层社独立活动的能力，并在进行民主教育、加强民主管理等方面给予具体帮助。放任自流或管得过细、过死，都是不对的。
    贯彻执行勤俭办社的方针
    毛主席说：“勤俭经营应当是全国一切农业生产合作社的方针，不，应当是一切经济事业的方针。勤俭办工厂，勤俭办商店，勤俭办一切国营事业和合作事业，勤俭办一切其他事业，什么事情都应执行勤俭的原则”。这一指示，对于手工业合作社来说，尤为重要。手工业合作社是集体所有制的生产企业，手工业劳动者原来就穷，要发展生产，改善生活，除了国家的某些必要援助外，主要依靠自己的辛勤劳动。手工业合作社必须切实贯彻“勤俭办社”的方针。勤，就是要勤劳生产，挖掘生产潜力，根据需要和可能，积极扩大再生产。俭，就是要厉行节约，降低生产成本，反对铺张浪费。几年来，有不少这样的老社，在开始创办时，生产资金很少、工具设备破旧不全，生产条件很坏，有的甚至全部靠银行贷款维持，但他们没有向困难低头，发扬了手工业劳动者勤劳刻苦的精神，向困难作斗争。经过曲折的发展过程，劳动生产率提高了，公共财富增加了，社员的生活也改善了。他们这种由小到大，由穷到富的发展过程，正是我国广大手工业劳动者，坚定地走合作化的道路，为摆脱自己的贫困而作一系列艰苦斗争的缩影，也是所有合作社应当努力学习的生动榜样。
    但是，并不是所有手工业合作社都是这样做了。有些合作社，经营管理混乱，制度不健全，劳动纪律松弛，旷工缺勤现象相当严重。有些合作社对产品质量和节约原材料关心不够，生产中造成严重浪费。有些合作社缺乏合理的工资制度，以致在纠正了工资偏低的情况以后，又出现了工资偏高的趋势，甚至还发生分光积累的不良现象。有些合作社脱产人员多、非生产开支大。还有些合作社不顾条件地扩建厂房，购买机器，结果厂房用不着，机器设备闲置起来。这些情况，显然是不符合“勤俭办社”的方针和手工业劳动者勤劳俭朴的优良传统。
    为了认真地贯彻执行“勤俭办社”的方针，进一步发展生产、巩固和提高合作社，必须做好五项工作：
    第一、根据大社、小社和小组的不同情况，建立和健全必要的生产管理制度，防止和克服无人负责和生产秩序混乱的现象。每个合作社都应该通过社员讨论，制订积极可靠的生产计划；同时，根据制造、修配和不同产品的情况，灵活地采用大流水、小流水和单人作业等不同的劳动组合，加强车间和小组的生产责任制，树立自觉的劳动纪律，提高出勤率，以保证计划的完成。为了不断地提高产品质量，应该明确树立“质量第一”的思想，反对粗制滥造、单纯追求数量的倾向。在劳动时间上，旺季可以多做一些，淡季可以少做一些，不应机械执行工厂式的上下班制度。
    第二、合理制订原材料耗用定额，周密设计，正确地剪裁断料，做好原材料收发、保管和配料工作，以便在保证质量的基础上，节约一切可能节约的原材料，消除原材料丢失、霉烂和大材小用、优材劣用等浪费现象。同时，还要充分利用废品废料和代用品，积极开辟原料资源，努力组织可能的原料生产，解决原材料困难。
    第三、手工业合作社现在只能实行合理的低工资制。工资的增长，不仅要低于劳动生产率的增长，而且还要和社会工资水平相适应。在城市一般不应高于当地同行业、同等技术条件的国营工厂；在小城镇和农村应该照顾原来手工业者和农民历史上收入的比例水平。手工业合作社（组）中，目前工资水平基本合适的，应该稳定在现有的水平上；偏高的应该加以控制，并说服社员进行适当调低；偏低的要在搞好生产的基础上，经过上级领导机关批准，逐步提高。实行计件工资制的社（组），应该根据平均先进的原则，确定各种定额，加强定额管理工作。目前有的社定额偏低和计件工资单价偏高的，应该及时加以修订。计件工资制对刺激社员提高劳动生产率有积极作用，但必须具备供销正常、成批生产、便于计算定额等条件，不能盲目推行。不能实行或暂时没有条件实行计件工资的，可以采用计时或计时奖励工资制。实行批成工资制的社（组），应该根据生产特点和业务淡旺的变化情况，灵活地调整批成比例，使社员的实得工资不少于或不超过基本工资太多。超额工资只能是少数先进社员才能拿到，不能人人都拿。“人人拿超额，月月拿超额”的情况是不合理的。对于年终劳动分红，应该限制在不超过本人一个月的平均工资以内；如果社员实得的工资已经过高，可以根据具体情况，不分红，或者少分红。对于劳保福利工作，当前着重解决治病问题，其他应随着生产的发展，分别轻重缓急，逐步举办。
    第四、基层社的理事会，应该直接管理生产，减少不必要的中间层次，让干部回到生产中去，接触实际，接触群众。基层社的脱产人员，应该根据实际需要，力争做到不脱产、半脱产或少脱产。要求把全国基层社脱产人员占社员人数的比重压缩到5％以下。
    第五、加强财务管理，严格制止挪用公款和贪污、盗窃等不良现象。对于社员的临时性困难，可以采取群众性的互助储金会来解决。社内各项开支应该力求节约，各项修建、购置，应该精打细算，可缓办的就缓办，可办可不办的坚决不办。讲究排场、追求豪华的做法是极端错误的。
    巩固组织、发展生产，迎接第二个五年计划
    我国人民在今后十年到十五年内的基本任务，就是要在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，把我国建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。
    第二个五年计划是实现这一任务的一个极其重要的关键。党在关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划建议的基本任务中规定：“继续完成社会主义改造，巩固和扩大集体所有制和全民所有制”。根据这一要求，全国手工业合作社必须在深入社会主义改造的基础上，巩固社会主义的思想阵地，树立手工业工人和贫苦独立的劳动者的领导优势，认真贯彻“民主办社”和“勤俭办社”的方针，挖掘生产潜力，端正经营作风，不断地扩大再生产，并在发展生产的基础上，增加合作社的积累，逐步改善社员生活，争取在三年至五年的时间内，在经济上、政治上、思想上把所有的手工业合作社巩固起来。在巩固手工业合作社的同时，对现有约占全部社（组）四分之一的供销生产社和生产小组，在条件成熟的时候，应当引导他们转为生产合作社。
　　对现有合作社领导下的分散经营户，必须加强管理，不得放任自流。对现有约占手工业从业人员总数8％的个体户，应当继续加强对他们团结、教育和改造工作。其中，对需要组织起来的个体户，应当有步骤地吸收他们参加合作社（组）；对产品过于零星和串街游乡、流动服务的手工业者，可以在较长时期内继续保持个体经营的方式，以补充集体经营的不足，但亦要加强领导和教育，提高他们的社会主义觉悟，使他们更好地为社会需要服务；对某些非法经营的自发户，应当协助行政管理部门，进行坚决的控制和斗争。
    为了进一步发展生产力，一部分手工业合作组织在适当的条件下，将要逐步地发展成为国营企业，这是必要的。但一般地说，这需要经过一个相当长的时间，并且需要由国家有计划地、逐步地安排。现有的个别合作社，如果条件成熟，可以经过省、市、自治区党委和政府的批准，转为国营工厂或联社领导下的合作工厂。但绝大多数的合作社，应当努力巩固现有的集体所有制经济，不要忙于转变为国营工厂。对现有八百多个合作工厂，应该加强领导，很好总结经验，把工厂办好，不要急于推广。
    第二个五年计划时期，是我国工农业生产全面高涨的新时期，为了适应国家建设和人民生活日益增长的需要，全国手工业合作组织，必须在巩固、提高的基础上，调动一切积极因素，不断地提高劳动生产率，发展生产，更有力地发挥现代工业的助手作用。要求在第二个五年计划期内，手工业生产的发展速度不低于工农业生产的平均增长速度，并且争取超过。
    我们的任务是艰巨的，又是光荣的。我们必须完成，而且也有条件完成。我们必须充分运用各种有利条件，根据国民经济的发展要求和本身的具体情况，制订积极可靠的全面规划，动员和组织全体社员和干部，继续广泛、深入、持久地开展增产节约运动，掀起全面的生产高潮，同全国人民一起，为又多又快又好又省地全面完成和超额完成新的国家计划而奋斗！
