Xinhua News Agency, December 12th – According to "Moscow News," the turbine of the world's first power station fueled by coal gas produced from underground coal gasification was successfully trial-operated in Tula a few days ago.

    The newly made gas turbine burns coal gas from the Moscow coalfield, which is rich in lignite. The success of the test marks a huge technological revolution in the coal mining industry, which will free miners from arduous underground labor and save a lot of money. According to calculations, if large enterprises of this type are established, they can produce billions of cubic meters of coal gas every year. The cost of power produced by this method will be half or two-thirds lower than the cost of power produced by ordinary mined coal. Labor productivity will also increase three to four times. Personnel can be reduced by three-quarters compared to ordinary thermal power plants.

    For a long time, people have dreamed of directly using the energy in coal without having to dig it out from the depths of the ground. The great Russian scientist Mendeleev proposed the theory in this regard. There are several underground coal gasification centers in the Soviet Union, which have been conducting experimental work in this area since 1931, finding ways to ignite coal, finding ways to control the invisible and complex coal combustion process, and obtaining coal gas from it.

    However, to build a power station powered by underground coal gasification, it is also necessary to produce highly heat-resistant steel for the turbine blades, ensure that the machine and equipment are not affected by cold and heat, and design the turbine itself, etc. Now, all these problems have been solved.

    The fuel base of this new type of power station built near Tula is forty to fifty meters underground, where coal seams are burning, spewing amazingly fierce flames, with temperatures reaching over 1,000 degrees Celsius. People use various specialized instruments to control the fuel combustion process on the ground. More than 40,000 cubic meters of coal gas per hour are sent to the combustion chamber through pipes with a diameter of 180 centimeters. Geologists have determined that the coal seam on which the power station relies has reserves of 50 million tons, which can be used for 70 years.

    In addition to coal gas, compressors also send 200,000 cubic meters of air per hour into the combustion chamber. After the coal gas is burned, it generates gas with a temperature as high as 650 degrees, which pushes the turbine blades to work according to the principle of jet engines. The power generation capacity of the turbine is 12,000 kilowatts. At present, the Soviet Union is also building other such power stations for testing.

    Xinhua News Agency, December 12th – TASS Moscow: Soviet Minister of Geology and Mineral Resources Protection, Antropov, said that the Lena coal region in the Yakut Autonomous Republic of Eastern Siberia is the largest coal region in the world. There is every reason to believe that the coal reserves there will be one to one and a half times more than the currently known total coal reserves in the world. At present, the proven coal reserves in this coal region are nearly five trillion tons.

### 动力来自地底下　采煤工业大改观  世界首座地下煤气电站试转成功  西伯利亚勒拿区是世界最大的煤区

    动力来自地底下　采煤工业大改观
    世界首座地下煤气电站试转成功
    西伯利亚勒拿区是世界最大的煤区
    新华社12日讯　据“莫斯科新闻”报道，世界上第一座以煤在地下气化后所产生的煤气为燃料的发电站的涡轮机，几天以前已经在图拉进行试运转。
    这个新制成的煤气涡轮机所烧的是来自盛产褐煤的莫斯科煤田里的煤气。试验的成功标志着采煤工业中完成了一个巨大的技术革命，它将使矿工从艰辛的地下劳作中解脱出来，并且可以节约大量资金。据计算，如果成立这类的大企业，每年可产生几十亿立方公尺的煤气，用这种方法所生产的动力的成本将比用普通开采煤所生产的动力的成本要减低一半或三分之二。劳动生产率也将提高到三、四倍。人员可以比普通电热工厂少四分之三。
    长期以来，人们一直梦想着直接利用煤中的能而不必把它从地下深处挖出来。伟大的俄罗斯科学家门德雷叶夫就曾提出这方面的理论。在苏联有好几个地下煤气中心，自1931年以来就进行着这方面的实验工作，找出使煤燃烧起来的方法，找出控制看不见的、复杂的煤的燃烧过程并从中取得煤气的方法。
    但是要修建用地下煤气化后的煤气为动力的发电站还必须生产制造涡轮机的叶片用的高度抗热钢，必须保证使机器设备不受冷热的影响，还必须设计这种涡轮机本身等等。现在，所有这些问题都已经解决。
    在图拉附近建成的这座新型发电站的燃料基地在地下四、五十公尺深处，那里燃烧着煤层，喷着惊人猛烈的火焰，温度高达摄氏一千度以上。人们利用各种专门仪器在地面上操纵着燃料燃烧的过程。每小时有四万多立方公尺煤气顺着直径一百八十厘米的管子送到燃烧室。地质学家确定，发电站赖以工作的煤层蕴藏量达到五千万吨，可以用七十年之久。
    除了煤气以外，还有压气机每小时把二十万立方公尺的空气送进燃烧室。煤气燃烧后产生温度高达六百五十度的气体，推动涡轮机的叶片，使之根据喷气发动机的原理工作。涡轮机的发电力是一万二千瓩。目前苏联还在建设另外一些这样的动力站进行试验。
    据新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联地质和矿藏保护部长安特罗波夫说，位于东西伯利亚的雅库特自治共和国的勒拿煤区是世界上最大的煤区。完全有根据认为，那里的煤藏量将比现在已经知道的全世界煤的总藏量还要多一倍到一倍半。目前这个煤区已经探明的煤储量就将近有五万亿吨。
