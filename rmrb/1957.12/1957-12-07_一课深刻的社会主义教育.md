	Inside the gate of the "Taimiao" Great Hall in the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace, two tall full-body photographs stand side by side. The faces in the two photos are so similar, but their clothes are completely different. One is a beggar image, dressed in rags, wearing a torn straw hat, carrying a broken basket, holding a dog-beating stick, and barefoot. The other is a rural work cadre, dressed extremely neatly, with a pen hanging on his chest, a notebook in his pocket, and a watch on his wrist. They are the same person—Liu Jemei, the head of the agricultural technology guidance station in Macaomiao Township, Huanggang County, Hubei Province.

	These two photographs are the first exhibits to attract attention at the "Liu Jemei's Life Comparison Exhibition Before and After" that opened on the 6th. On the slogan board to the left of the photos, Liu Jemei's remarks at the Huanggang County three-level cadre meeting are written. He said: "Shouting every day that the people's lives have improved, only ghosts believe this. If you want to eat more, there's only so much grain; if you want to wear more, cloth coupons have to be discounted; buying meat requires meat coupons; buying oil requires oil coupons... In my opinion, the best way to get farmers to support the Communist Party is to abolish the unified purchase and sales system."

	"The county party committee keeps shouting from above about the superiority of collectivization, but I don't think it's as good as the two years of land reform."

	"When the Communist Party carried out land reform, it was for the farmers, but now it's disciplining the farmers. There are many difficulties in doing work, it's exhausting, and it's not as good as being bitten by dogs when begging in the past."

	Is it really as Liu Jemei said? The exhibition answers this question with the personal life experience of the head of this agricultural technology guidance station, with incomparably eloquent and vivid facts.

	A series of color pictures show that Liu Jemei's family, starting from his grandfather, went bankrupt due to poor harvests and landlords' debt-collecting, selling all their land, and began a life of begging and wandering. Liu Jemei himself was born into an extremely impoverished family and was only a month old when his mother took him out to beg for food. This begging life continued until he was fourteen years old. At this time, although Liu Jemei was not yet an adult, he had just dropped his begging stick and went to work as a long-term laborer in a rich peasant's home. His two younger sisters were not yet ten years old and were forced to be sent to others as child brides. In these years of suffering from hunger, cold, and bullying, Liu Jemei's experience, as shown in the pictures, is a tragic history of blood and tears. Working as a long-term laborer not only meant suffering all kinds of torture but also being subjected to beatings. His mother also died at this time due to poverty and illness.

	The pictures tell the audience that Liu Jemei's miserable fate, who had begged for twelve years and worked as a long-term laborer for more than ten years, did not end until liberation. In the land reform, he was allocated six mu and three fen of good land and a full set of farming cattle and agricultural implements, as well as a new four-room tiled house with a pond in front and a vegetable garden in the back. To show Liu Jemei's past living conditions, the exhibition displayed all the property that Liu Jemei and his family owned before liberation, which is what is in front of the audience: the broken gourd that Liu Jemei used to beg for food in his childhood, the broken basket used for fleeing famine, and the broken cotton-padded jacket passed down from his great-grandfather through four generations until Liu Jemei was twelve years old before it was his turn to wear it, as well as the broken bamboo mat placed on a broken wooden bed with only three legs, the sparse and rotten broken cotton wadding, and the mosquito net patched with five or six layers of patches. According to the narrator, these broken cotton wadding and mosquito net were the dowry of Liu Jemei's great-grandmother. Counting it, it has been more than eighty years since it was passed down to Liu Jemei. Among the exhibits on display are also a pair of wooden clogs worn by three people together and some bottomless bamboo baskets, topless straw hats, and fragmented wooden basins.

	Liu Jemei repeatedly opposed the unified purchase and sales system and agricultural collectivization. Did the unified purchase and sales system and agricultural collectivization really mess things up? Is his current life really not as good as being bitten by dogs when begging in the past? The exhibition made the clearest explanation. Here, people can see the carved and hollow red lacquer bed, which was newly added after liberation, with new mosquito nets and Pacific bedsheets, eight new cotton wads, newly purchased tables, chairs, boxes, cabinets, and rubber shoes, leather shoes, fine porcelain teapots, thermos bottles, and more than eighty pieces of various clothes that Liu Jemei's family has added in five years. These clothes not only include single clothes, lined clothes, cotton clothes, and menswear, womenswear, and childrenswear, but also Liu Jemei's own newly added wool sweaters and sheepskin coats; the materials of the clothes range from fine cloth to twill, poplin, and khaki, all kinds of colors. The chart of rising living standards after collectivization and unified purchase and sales also shows that by 1956, the average grain consumption of Liu Jemei's entire family had gradually risen to 540 jin, an increase of 226 jin compared to 1948; the family's cooking oil consumption in 1956 increased sevenfold compared to 1948—reaching 17.4 jin; pork, which was rarely eaten in the past, was eaten 42 jin in 1956 due to the current system of purchasing with tickets. Liu Jemei's huge changes in life after liberation, especially after collectivization, are incomparable to his past painful years of having no way to beg, eating chaff and wild vegetables, and wearing one piece of clothing for three or four generations regardless of age or season. In the face of these facts, even Liu Jemei himself came to this conclusion at the Huanggang County three-level cadre meeting debate.

	Liu Jemei's changes in life after liberation also represent the rise and leap forward in the lives of the farmers in his hometown and the farmers across the country. People can also see from the charts here that after collectivization, by 1956, the total income of all poor farmers, new and old lower-middle peasants in Liu Jemei's hometown had increased by 54% compared to 1952, and the income of eight poor farmers had even increased by 1.9 times compared to 1952. Due to the development of production, the living conditions of farmers across the country have also undergone tremendous changes. According to the materials provided by the exhibition, in the rural areas across the country, 80% of farm households have reached the living standards of the general middle peasants before collectivization, and 20% to 30% have even reached the living standards of prosperous middle peasants. Before liberation, poor and hired peasants accounted for 70% of the country. At that time, poor farmers across the country handed over nearly 100 billion jin of grain to landlords and rich peasants every year, accounting for one-third of the country's total grain output. The situation was completely different after the land reform and collectivization. For example, in 1956, the total amount of grain retained by farmers across the country reached 315.6 billion jin (raw grain), an increase of 43.7 billion jin compared to 1953. During the same period, the grain supplied by the state to farmers also increased from 40.5 billion jin in 1953 to 52.2 billion jin in 1956. The average per capita physical consumption in rural areas has also increased to varying degrees. Among them, the consumption of vegetable oil increased from 1.7 jin in 1949 to 3.8 jin in 1956, and sugar also increased from 0.3 jin to 1.7 jin. The consumption of cotton cloth in 1956 also increased more than threefold compared to 1949, and the amount of cloth used per capita across the country reached 20 city feet.

	The lives of farmers across the country have improved and risen after liberation and collectivization, and Liu Jemei's own life has improved and risen even more significantly. Why did he forget the pain after the wound healed and attack the collectivization policy and the unified purchase and sales policy? The pictures and materials in the exhibition provide a profound analysis. It turns out that Liu Jemei, who had been very active in a series of struggles from rent reduction and interest reduction, eliminating bandits and fighting local bullies to land reform after liberation, and had been successively rated as a model worker in Huanggang County three times and admitted to the Party, lost his way in the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads after being eroded by capitalist ideas after being allocated land and turning over, and longed for the beautiful scenery of a thirty-mu field, a cow, and a warm bed for his wife and children to get rich individually. Therefore, when he began to get rich in 1953, he planned to take out five shi of grain, two bolts of cloth, and two hundred yuan of accumulated wages to lend, and follow Cao Qizhai, who hired long-term and short-term workers in his hometown to rely on exploitation income to get rich. If Liu Jemei's plan to get rich had continued to develop, what would the consequences be and what would the situation in the rural areas at that time be like? People can clearly see from the charts that the money, cloth, and grain that Liu Jemei planned to lend, plus the one shi of grain and one bolt of cloth that had already been lent out, could be rolled to 96 shi of grain, 32 bolts of cloth, and 3,200 yuan by 1957 at the interest rate of "one extra for every ten." Owning these properties would be equivalent to the largest landlords in the township, Fan Hansan and Qi Yuting, and 200 farmers would be impoverished and bankrupt due to his usury exploitation. In fact, at that time, the phenomenon of polarization had already appeared in Liu Jemei's hometown—Dawo Bay and other three administrative villages. Among the 229 farm households in the whole village, 58 poor farmers and new and old lower-middle peasants had begun to decline, and 22 of them had begun to borrow usury and sell green crops, fields, cattle, and other means of production; while only 20 had risen by relying on various exploitation incomes, and they were all new and old upper-middle peasants and rich peasants. It can be imagined that if Liu Jemei's personal dream of getting rich were realized, then the entire rural area would return to the tragic situation where a few people got rich by exploitation and the majority were impoverished and bankrupt. The only difference is that the current Liu Jemei has become the wealthy person of the past, and more people have become the Liu Jemei of the past.

	However, history will not repeat itself. The Party's general line during the transition period—the unified purchase and sales policy and collectivization policy to gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture—blocked Liu Jemei's capitalist path. Liu Jemei's capitalist acts of lending at high interest rates were criticized and restricted, and the five shi of rice used to get rich were purchased as surplus grain. Therefore, Liu Jemei, who had actively participated in the democratic revolution, began to deviate from the Party's line in the face of this great turning point, was deeply dissatisfied with the unified purchase and sales system, expressed opposition to collectivization, and did not accept the Party's education and persuasion. These are the origins of his degeneration and his attacks on the unified purchase and sales system and collectivization in the Great Leap Forward.

	Now, Liu Jemei has woken up after debate, comparison, and criticism. At the exhibition that he personally helped to set up, people saw him express deep repentance in the face of the old clothes that evoked bitter memories. In front of the broad masses who visited this exhibition today, he said painfully: I was wrong. The capitalist idea of wanting to get rich without working hard through exploitation harmed me. The Communist Party educated and rescued me, making me wake up from the dream of going to the dark. Socialism is common prosperity, and capitalism is one person getting rich while millions of people suffer poverty. In the future, I will definitely dig out the roots of capitalism thoroughly and forever follow the Communist Party on the road of socialism.

　　一课深刻的社会主义教育
　　新华社记者　华敏
    在北京劳动人民文化宫“太庙”大殿的门里，并排竖立着两幅高大的全身照片。两张照片的面貌是那么相像，可是衣着却完全不同。一个是衣衫褴褛、头戴破草帽、手挽破提篮、握着打狗棒、打着赤脚的叫化子形象，一个是衣着极为整洁、胸前挂着钢笔、口袋里装着笔记本、手上带着手表的农村工作干部。他们却是同一个人——湖北省黄冈县马曹庙乡农业技术指导站长刘介梅。
    这两幅照片是6日开幕的“刘介梅今昔生活对比展览会”上首先引人注意的展品，就在照片左面的标语牌上，写着刘介梅在黄冈县三级干部会议上的言论。他说：“天天叫喊群众生活改善了，这只有鬼相信。要吃点，粮食只有那么多；要穿点，布票要打折；买肉要肉票；买油要油票……我看，要农民拥护共产党，最好是取消统购统销这个办法。”
    “县委光在上面喊合作化这优越，那优越，我看就不如土改那两年优越。”
    “共产党在土改的时候是为农民，现在是整农民，搞工作困难多，累死人，还不如过去讨饭被狗咬。”
    难道事实就真像刘介梅所说的那样吗？展览会以这个农业技术指导站站长亲身的生活经历，以无比雄辩的生动事实回答了这个问题。
    一幅接着一幅的彩色图片说明，刘介梅的家庭从祖父起，就因歉收、地主逼债出卖全部土地而破产，开始过乞讨游荒的日子。刘介梅自己在赤贫如洗的家庭里出世后才满月，母亲就抱着他出门讨饭，这种乞讨生涯一直延续到十四岁。这时，刘介梅虽然还没成年，但是刚刚丢掉了讨饭棒，就到一个富农家里当了长工；两个妹妹还不满十岁，就被迫送给别人当了童养媳。在这些饥寒交迫受人欺凌的苦难岁月里，刘介梅的遭遇就像图片所展示的，是一部惨痛的血泪史。做长工不但受尽折磨，还要遭受毒打。他的母亲也就是这时在贫病交迫中死去了。
    图片告诉观众，讨过十二年饭，做过十年多长工的刘介梅的悲苦命运，一直到解放时才结束。在土地改革中分得了六亩三分好田和全套耕牛农具以及前有池塘后有菜园的四大间新瓦房，为了表明刘介梅过去的生活景况，展览会展出了刘介梅和他全家在解放前拥有的全部财产，这就是摆在观众面前屈指可数的：刘介梅童年用来讨饭的破瓢、逃荒用的破箩筐和曾祖父传下来穿过四代人到刘介梅十二岁才轮到他穿的破棉袄，以及放在只有三条腿的破木床上的破篾席、稀烂的破棉絮和补纳了五、六层补钉的蚊帐。据讲解员说，这些破棉絮和蚊帐还是刘介梅曾祖母的嫁妆。计算起来，传到刘介梅已有八十多年了。在陈列的展品中，还有一双三个人合穿的木屐和一些没有底的竹篮、没有顶的草帽和支离破碎的木盆等。
    刘介梅口口声声反对统购统销和农业合作化，是不是统购统销和农业合作化真的搞糟了呢？他现在的生活是不是真的不如过去讨饭被狗咬好呢？展览会作了最清楚的说明。在这里，人们可以看到挂着新蚊帐铺着太平洋被单，在解放后才添置起来的雕花镂空红漆床，八床新棉絮，新置的桌、椅、箱、柜和胶鞋、皮鞋、细瓷茶壶、热水瓶以及刘介梅一家大小在五年时间里添置起来的八十多件各式衣服，这些衣服中不仅有单衣、夹衣、棉衣和男装、女装、童装，还有刘介梅本人新添的毛线衣、羊皮袄；衣服的质料从细布到斜纹、府绸、卡叽色色俱全。而合作化和统购统销后生活上升的图表又表明：到1956年，刘介梅全家每人的平均吃粮已逐步上升到五百四十斤，比1948年增加了二百二十六斤；全家的食油用量1956年比1948年增加了七倍——达到十七点四斤；过去从来很少吃到的猪肉，由于现在实行了凭票购买办法，1956年就吃了四十二斤。刘介梅解放以后特别是合作化以后生活的巨大变化，是他过去乞讨无门、吃糠咽菜，一件衣服不分老、少，不分寒暑穿三、四代的痛苦年月所无法比拟的，在这些事实面前，在黄冈县三级干部会议的辩论会上，就连刘介梅自己也得出了这样的结论。
    刘介梅解放以后的生活变化，也代表着他家乡的农民和全国农民生活的上升和跃进。人们在这里从图表上还可以看到，刘介梅家乡的所有贫农、新、老下中农在合作化以后，到1956年，他们的总收入就比1952年增加了54％，其中八户贫农的收入，甚至比1952年增长了一点九倍。由于生产的发展，全国农民的生活景况也有了巨大改变。据展览会提供的材料，现在全国农村中，有80％的农户已经达到合作化以前的一般中农的生活水平，其中有20％到30％，并且已经达到富裕中农的生活水平。在解放以前，全国贫雇农就占70％，当时，全国贫苦农民每年交给地主、富农的粮食将近一千亿斤，占到全国粮食总产量的三分之一。土地改革和合作化以后，情况就截然不同了，例如在1956年，全国农民的留粮总数就达到三千一百五十六亿斤（原粮），比1953年增加了四百三十七亿斤，在同一时期，国家供应农民的粮食又由1953年的四百零五亿斤增加到1956年的五百二十二亿斤，农村每一人口的平均实物消费量，也都有不同程度的增长，其中植物油的消费量由1949年的一点七斤增加到1956年的三点八斤，食糖也由零点三斤增加到一点七斤，1956年棉布的消费量也比1949年增长了三倍多，全国每一人口用布量达到了二十市尺。
    全国农民在解放以后和合作化以后生活改善了、提高了，刘介梅自己的生活改善和提高得更为显著，他为什么好了疮疤忘了痛，攻击合作化政策和统购统销政策呢？展览会上的图片、资料作了深刻的剖析。原来这个在解放以后减租减息、清匪反霸到土地改革一系列斗争中表现非常积极，并接连三次被评为黄冈县的工作模范又被吸收入党的刘介梅，在分到地翻了身以后，由于受到资本主义思想的侵蚀，在社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争中迷失了方向，一心向往三十亩地一头牛、老婆孩子热炕头的个人发家致富的美景，因此，当他在1953年开始富裕起来的时候，他就计划拿出五石谷、两匹布和积存的二百元工资放债，向本乡雇用长、短工依靠剥削收入而致富的曹其斋看齐，如果按照刘介梅的发家计划发展下去，它的后果以及当时的农村又将会出现怎样的情景呢？人们通过图表可以清楚地看到刘介梅计划放账的钱、布、谷再加上已经放出的一石谷和一匹布，按“大加一”利息滚到1957年，就能得到九十六石谷、三十二匹布和三千二百元钱，拥有这些财产，就相当于本乡最大的樊汉三、齐玉廷两户地主那样大，有二百户农民因他的高利贷剥削而贫困破产。而事实上当时刘介梅的家乡——大屋湾等三个行政村，已经出现向两极分化的现象。全村二百二十九户农户中，已有五十八户贫农和新老下中农开始下降，其中有二十二户已开始借高利贷和出卖青苗以及田地、耕牛等生产资料；而靠各种剥削收入上升的只有二十户，他们都是新老上中农和富农。可以想像，如果刘介梅的个人发家梦想得到实现，那么整个农村将重新回到少数人靠剥削致富、多数人贫穷破产的悲惨境地，所不同的，只是现在的刘介梅做了当年的财主，而更多的人成了当年的刘介梅。
    但是，历史是不会重演的。党在过渡时期的总路线——逐步实现对农业社会主义改造的统购统销政策和合作化政策，堵塞了刘介梅的资本主义道路。刘介梅的放高利贷的资本主义行径受到了批判和限制，借以发家致富的五石稻谷被作为余粮统购。因此，曾经积极参加过民主革命的刘介梅在这伟大的转折面前和党的路线开始背道而驰，对统购统销深怀不满，对合作化表示反对，同时又不接受党的教育和劝导，这些就是他开始蜕化和在大鸣大放中攻击统购统销、攻击合作化的由来。
    现在，刘介梅经过辩论、对比、批判之后，醒悟过来了。在他亲自帮助布置起来的展览会上，人们看到他面对着唤起辛酸回忆的破旧衣物表示深切的忏悔。在今天参观这个展览会的广大群众面前，他痛切的说：我错了，想不劳而获靠剥削致富的资本主义思想害了我，共产党教育和挽救了我，使我从走向黑暗的迷梦中清醒过来。社会主义是共同富裕，资本主义是一人发财，千百万人受穷，今后，我一定把资本主义的根子彻底挖掉，永远跟着共产党走社会主义的道路。
