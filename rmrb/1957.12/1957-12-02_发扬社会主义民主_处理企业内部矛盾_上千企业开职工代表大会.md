Xinhua News Agency, December 1st. According to incomplete statistics from relevant central departments based on twenty-five provinces and cities, over a thousand industrial enterprises across the country have already convened employee representative assemblies. Experiences from various localities have proven that establishing an employee representative assembly system in enterprises under the correct leadership of the Party is a good way to promote socialist democracy, mobilize employees to participate in enterprise management and supervise the administrative work of the enterprise, and overcome bureaucracy. It is also one of the good methods to correctly handle internal enterprise contradictions. Currently, many localities are actively promoting the employee representative assembly system in enterprises in batches, based on the experience summarized from the first batch of pilot programs, combined with the rectification and socialist education movements.

According to reports from various localities, the vast majority of employee representative assemblies that have been held in many enterprises have had relatively good results. In these enterprises that have been run well, they have generally achieved the following significant results:

First, it is manifested in the masses. Due to the extensive promotion of democracy, the democratic life of enterprises has been enlivened, bottom-up criticism has been carried out, the leadership has seriously adopted the opinions of the masses, improved work and style based on the opinions of the masses, and solved the problems raised by the masses. Therefore, the socialist consciousness and sense of responsibility as masters of the masses have been further enhanced. Many employees said: "In the past, the factory management was only decided by the leaders, but now all the major issues of the factory are handed over to us for discussion, and we are truly masters of our own affairs." Tao Shouchun, an old worker from Wuhan Chemical Plant, became more enthusiastic about his work after being elected as an employee representative. In order to test the imported pigments that were lacking for medicinal soap, he worked day and night. When others advised him to rest, he said, "Being a master is not just lip service, a master should show the appearance of a master." Through his hard work, he quickly successfully tested the imported pigments that could not be bought at the time, solving the key problem of the suspension of medicinal soap production.

The employee representative assembly strengthens the masses' supervision of the leadership, exposes and criticizes the bureaucratic, subjectivist, and sectarian work styles of enterprise leaders, and also plays a significant role in promoting the transformation of the work styles of leading cadres. Some enterprise leaders in Hubei Province were afraid of "extreme democracy of the masses" and "too many mothers-in-law making it difficult for the daughter-in-law" before the meeting, but their feedback was different after the employee representative assembly was held. They generally felt that "things can only be done well by consulting with the masses" and "work can only be improved quickly by letting the masses supervise." A manager of Wuhan Yuhua Yarn Factory said after the meeting: "In the past, even if I was criticized for a hundred bureaucratic practices, I didn't know where the bureaucratic practices were, but this time I learned it from the criticism of the masses."

According to reports from various localities, the work styles of cadres who have been criticized by the employee representative assembly generally change relatively quickly. For example, Ge Dianchen, the safety section chief of Benxi First Coking Plant, used to be rude and seriously detached from the masses. After being severely criticized by the employee representative assembly, he took the initiative to go deep into contact with the masses and actively and conscientiously solved the problems raised by the masses, winning the praise of the masses. As a result, the safety section won the Red Flag Award in the second quarter department competition. Leading cadres in most enterprises have increased the time they spend going deep into workshops and work sections after the meeting, and some have also established a system of regularly receiving or visiting representatives and the masses, thus further strengthening the relationship between the leadership and the masses.

Some undesirable tendencies in enterprises, such as the lax labor discipline of some employees and excessive demands for living welfare, have also been corrected after the convening of the employee representative assembly, due to the improvement of employees' awareness and the establishment of the idea of ​​loving the factory as a home and running the enterprise diligently and thriftily and managing the household diligently and thriftily. After the meeting, the employees of the steel plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company automatically returned more than 2,000 pairs of unused gloves, more than 1,000 bars of soap, and more than 700 masks. The attendance rate of many enterprises has significantly improved, and the phenomenon of violating operating procedures has decreased compared to before. The tense atmosphere of people constantly asking cadres for houses and asking for relief in the past has also been greatly alleviated.

Since the employee representative assembly correctly handled the contradictions in all aspects within the enterprise, the enthusiasm and creativity of the employees have been better developed, and many opinions and suggestions for improving production management have been put forward. Therefore, it has also played a good role in ensuring the smooth completion of the production plan and promoting the further development of the increase production and practice economy movement. According to the materials reported by sixty-three enterprises such as Tianjin Paper Mill and Wuhan Printing Factory, their production has significantly improved after the employee representative assembly was convened, and thirty-five of them have overfulfilled their tasks.

Under the leadership of the Party, the trade union organizations in enterprises have done a lot of work and played a great role in preparing and convening the employee representative assembly, supervising the implementation of the resolutions of the employee representative assembly, and educating and organizing all employees to strive to achieve the resolutions of the assembly. The Party organizations in many enterprises have also strengthened the cadres of trade union work. The trade union has also improved its work through the employee representative assembly and further strengthened its ties with the masses.

According to relevant sources, in April of this year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on the issue of gradually establishing employee representative assemblies in enterprises; and made principled provisions on the nature and functions of the employee representative assembly. After that, all provinces and cities across the country universally launched pilot work. The experience of pilot programs in various localities has proven that the provisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the nature and functions of the employee representative assembly are correct. Various localities have gained rich experience in the first batch of pilot programs. These experiences are being researched and summarized.

In the rectification movement, many enterprises have universally used the organizational form of the employee representative assembly, achieving even better results. Many new forms and methods of promoting socialist democracy created by the masses in the rectification movement have added new content for consolidating and improving the employee representative assembly system in the future. The experience in this regard still needs to be further summarized by various localities.

　  发扬社会主义民主　处理企业内部矛盾
　　上千企业开职工代表大会
    据新华社1日讯　据中央有关部门根据二十五个省市的不完全统计，全国已经有上千个工业企业召开了职工代表大会。各地的经验证明，在党的正确领导下在企业中建立职工代表大会制度，是发扬社会主义民主，发动职工参加企业管理和对企业行政工作进行监督，克服官僚主义的良好形式，也是正确处理企业内部矛盾的良好方法之一。目前，许多地方都根据第一批试点总结的经验，结合整风和社会主义教育运动，积极地在企业中分批推广职工代表大会制度。
    据各地反映，许多企业已开过的职工代表大会，绝大多数的效果是比较好的。在开得较好的这些企业中，大都获得了如下几个方面的显著成绩：
    首先表现在群众方面，由于广泛地发扬了民主，活跃了企业的民主生活，开展了自下而上的批评，领导上认真地采纳了群众的意见，根据群众的意见改进了工作和作风，解决了群众所提出的问题，因而群众的社会主义觉悟和主人翁责任感进一步提高了。很多职工这样说：“过去工厂管理只是领导说了算，现在全厂的大事交给我们讨论了，真是当家作主了”。武汉化工厂老工人陶寿臣当选为职工代表后，工作热情更高。为了试验药皂缺乏的进口颜料，他不分昼夜地工作，别人劝他休息，他说：“主人不是空口说的，主人应拿出主人的样子来。”经过他刻苦钻研，很快试验成功了当前买不到的进口颜料，解决了药皂停止生产的关键问题。
    职工代表大会加强群众对领导的监督，揭露和批判企业领导干部的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义作风，对促进领导干部作风的转变也起很大作用。湖北省有些企业的领导干部在会前怕“群众极端民主”，怕“婆婆多了，媳妇难当”，但开过职工代表大会后，反映就不同了。普遍感到“只有同群众商量，事情才能办好”；“只有让群众监督，工作才改进得快”。武汉裕华纱厂一位经理在会后说：“过去批评我一百个官僚主义，我也不知道官僚主义在什么地方，但这次受到群众批评却知道了。”
    据各地反映，受到职工代表大会批评的干部，作风转变一般都比较快。如本溪第一焦化厂安全科长葛殿臣，过去态度粗暴，严重脱离群众。经过职工代表大会严厉批评以后，他主动深入联系群众，积极认真解决群众提出的问题，博得群众的好评。结果安全科在二季度科室竞赛中得到了红旗奖。大多数企业的领导干部，在会后都增加了深入车间、工段的时间，有的还建立了定期接待或访问代表和群众的制度，因此更密切了领导同群众的关系。
    企业中的一些不良倾向如部分职工劳动纪律松弛和对生活福利要求过多过高等现象，在召开了职工代表大会以后，由于职工觉悟的提高，并树立了爱厂如家和勤俭办企业、勤俭持家的思想，也得到了纠正。本溪钢铁公司钢厂在会后，职工们自动交回用不完的两千多副手套，一千多块肥皂和七百多个口罩。许多企业的出勤率有显著提高，违犯操作规程的现象比前减少。过去络绎不绝找干部要房子、闹救济的紧张空气也大大缓和了。
    由于职工代表大会正确地处理了企业内部各方面的矛盾，职工的积极性创造性有了更好的发扬，提出了许多改进生产管理工作的意见和建议，因而对保证生产计划的顺利完成、推动增产节约运动的进一步开展也起了良好的作用。据天津造纸厂、武汉印刷厂等六十三个企业报告的材料反映，他们在召开过职工代表大会以后，生产上都有了显著起色，其中有三十五个企业超额完成了任务。
    企业的工会组织在党的领导下，在准备和召集职工代表大会，监督职工代表大会决议的贯彻执行和教育与组织全体职工努力实现大会决议的过程中，做了许多工作，起了很大的作用。许多企业的党组织还加强了工会工作的干部。工会也通过职工代表大会改进了自己的工作，进一步密切了同群众的联系。
    据有关方面说，今年4月间，中共中央对逐步在企业中建立职工代表大会的问题发出了指示；并对职工代表大会的性质、职权作了原则的规定。以后，全国各省市即普遍展开试点工作。各地试点的经验证明，中共中央关于职工代表大会性质和职权的规定都是正确的。各地在第一批试点中都取得了丰富的经验。这些经验正在研究和总结中。
    在整风运动中，许多企业都普遍地运用了职工代表大会这一组织形式，取得了更加良好的效果。整风运动中群众所创造的许多发扬社会主义民主的新的形式和办法，为今后巩固提高职工代表大会制度增加了新的内容，这方面的经验还需要各地进一步很好地加以总结。
