　　Where Does Their Enthusiasm Come From?
　　— A Glimpse of the Second Session of the First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province —
  　Our Correspondent Lü Jianzhong
    Room "433" in the Jingzhou Hotel, Taiyuan City, has been particularly lively these past few days. The delegates from Jieyu County attending the Provincial Party Congress are discussing the production increase targets for their county here, based on the spirit of the Forty Articles and the provincial Party committee’s preliminary draft of the provincial twelve-year agricultural development plan (revised draft).

    The delegates were inspired by the production increase measures in the provincial Party committee’s plan, but felt that several important figures in the plan were not ideal enough:

    The average per-mu yield of grain in the province by 1967 should increase from 127 jin in 1955 to 315 jin, with the Jinan region increasing from 158 jin in 1955 to 420 jin.

    The average per-mu yield of cotton (lint) in the province by 1967 should increase from 38 jin in 1955 to 80 jin, with the Jinan region increasing from 41.5 jin in 1955 to 86 jin.

    Before submitting this draft plan to this Party Congress for discussion, the provincial Party committee had undergone several discussions and revisions. During the discussions, some comrades were cautious about the production increase targets, and they had their reasons for this. This was because the grain yield in Shanxi Province had always been very unstable in the past few years: the yield per unit area in 1954 was 133.9 jin, 127.5 jin in 1955, 150 jin in 1956, and 120.6 jin in 1957. There were many reasons for the unstable yield, but the most important one was that water conservancy could not keep up - of the province's 68.34 million mu of cultivated land, only about 10 million mu are currently irrigated. The two severe production reductions in 1955 and 1957 were mainly caused by drought.

    However, the delegates from Jieyu County also had their reasons for feeling that the provincial Party committee’s target was not ideal enough. Their enthusiasm for increasing production was very high, and this enthusiasm mainly came from the hundreds of thousands of people in the county who were vigorously engaging in production and construction in conjunction with the discussion of the Forty Articles.

    During the discussion, the delegates believed that, like the situation in the whole province, the water conservancy problem was also the main key to increasing production in the county. Jieyu County has few rivers, but the underground water source is very abundant. Before liberation, the county only had more than 10,000 mu of irrigated land. After liberation, especially after the first winter and spring upsurge of water conservancy construction after the advanced cooperativization, the county’s irrigated land developed to more than 260,000 mu, enabling it to win a bumper harvest from the drought in 1956. Recently, they have launched a winter production upsurge throughout the county with "thousands of machines roaring during the day and ten thousand lights shining at night." After the Huaguoshan Agricultural Cooperative refuted conservative ideas, the members wanted to use the spirit of "the Monkey King making havoc in Heaven" to make "low water flow upward, irrigating Huaguoshan all over." On November 7, the Xisu Agricultural Cooperative completed two large canals, one named "October Revolution Canal" and the other named "Debate Canal." During the debate, some members proposed saving grain to support the people digging wells at night; some members invested the money they had prepared to build houses into the cooperative for water conservancy construction. In many places, the masses spontaneously organized survey teams to go up the mountains and down to the fields to find water sources, and launched challenge competitions, which were extremely enthusiastic.

    The masses' overwhelming momentum of conquering nature and their enthusiasm for production added courage and wisdom to the delegates. When discussing and formulating the county's production increase targets at this meeting, they clarified that as long as they adhere to the principle of "adapting to local conditions, overall planning, focusing on small-scale projects, and supplementing with medium-sized projects," they can mobilize and organize the people of the county, and the development of water conservancy can be done more, faster, better, and more economically. Luo Chengxi, director of the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative, and Gao Mingzhong, director of the Liaoyuan Agricultural Cooperative, who participated in this Party Congress, had created very good experiences based on this principle. The Red Star Cooperative is located at the foot of Zhongtiao Mountain. They adopted the method of digging springs to intercept the flow and building reservoirs. In less than a year, they invested 3,200 yuan to develop more than 5,900 mu of irrigated land. The Liaoyuan Agricultural Cooperative is located in the plain. After overall planning, they adopted the method of using old wells, digging new wells, and digging canals to establish an irrigation network, and used mechanical pumping. In two years, they achieved the cooperative's water conservancy ahead of schedule, saving more than 280,000 yuan in investment compared to the original plan. Based on these, the delegates from Jieyu County are full of confidence in the plan to expand the irrigated land to 400,000 mu this winter and next spring and achieve water conservancy throughout the county by the end of 1959.

    The delegates also believed that with the development of water conservancy, fertilizer must also keep up. On this point, the masses of the county also excavated a lot of fertilizer sources in the debate on the Forty Articles, and one of the more important measures is to vigorously develop pig raising. The average amount of fertilizer applied per mu of land in the county next year can be increased by 40% compared to this year. In addition, with the reform of the cultivation system and the improvement of cultivation technology, the average per-mu yield of grain in the county in 1958 can be increased from 184 jin this year to 262 jin, and cotton can be increased from 55 jin this year to 70 jin, striving to reach 80 jin. Including other agricultural and sideline income, the net income per person in the county next year can be increased from 97 yuan this year to 335.1 yuan, an increase of 142.1% compared to the average income of 103 yuan per person for well-to-do middle peasants before cooperativization.

    Is such a great leap forward possible, in which the income of every farmer in the county will jump from below that of well-to-do middle peasants to more than double that of well-to-do middle peasants in one year? The power of the masses boosted their confidence. The farmers of Jieyu County have invested a lot of income into water conservancy construction. Now the county has more than 6,000 water wheels, more than 1,000 pot camel machines and diesel engines, with an average of one water conservancy machine for every 33 households. Most of these machines were purchased by the agricultural cooperatives themselves this year and played a huge role in this year's drought resistance. This gave the delegates another very important inspiration: as long as we vigorously mobilize the masses and rely closely on the masses, we can create miracles.

    When the delegates debated the county's production increase targets for 1960, the struggle was very fierce. At that time, the county had already been water-conserved, pig raising and fertilizer accumulation had also been doubled, and after all 100,000 cadres in the province were all sent down and returned to their hometowns for production, the leadership force on the agricultural front would also be greatly strengthened, which would make the production increase conditions even more favorable. However, a dispute arose on the further reform of the cultivation system, especially the important measure of expanding the area of double cropping. Some delegates agreed, while others expressed doubt. Delegate Liu Shengxi cited the Xinghuo Cooperative he led as an example. This cooperative has an average of 13 mu of land per labor force, 900 mu of double cropping, and 700 mu of cotton. Both the spring and autumn seasons are very tight in terms of labor and animal power, and they cannot take care of it. This is indeed a common practical problem. However, everyone finally found a solution in the debate. First, strengthen labor management from the system and correct the members' labor attitude from ideological education to tap the labor potential of the members. Second, the more basic solution is to realize water conservancy mechanization. In this regard, the Liaoyuan Agricultural Cooperative led by Delegate Gao Mingzhong is a mirror. The cooperative's labor force was originally also very insufficient, but they installed a diesel engine and a pot camel machine, which not only drove water pumps to irrigate 2,000 mu of land, but also drove 18 cotton ginning machines, 6 delinting machines, and an oil mill and steel mill. This not only enables the cooperative to process all of its own cotton seeds, but also uses machines to replace oil extraction and member flour grinding. The delegates believed that the Liaoyuan Cooperative's approach was fully capable of being promoted in other agricultural cooperatives in the county.

    After a debate, everyone believed that it was entirely possible to expand the double-cropping area of the county to 250,000 mu in 1960. As for the yield, two of the delegates were leaders of agricultural cooperatives that achieved thousand-jin grain in some land and hundred-jin cotton in large areas this year. The conditions and measures for them to achieve such high records were not better than the above-mentioned production increase conditions in 1960. Based on this, the delegates finally discussed and decided that the cotton yield per mu in the county in 1960 would be more than 100 jin, and the average grain yield per mu would be 436 jin. This means that they can overfulfill the twelve-year target set by the provincial Party committee for the Jinan region by 1960!

    Once the above targets were determined, all the delegates were greatly encouraged. County Party Secretary Lu Da barely suppressed everyone's clamor. He wanted everyone to calm down again and consider the targets for 1962 and 1967. Everyone felt that after breaking through this "big barrier" in 1960, it would be much easier to discuss later. They believed that later, especially by 1967, in addition to the above-mentioned production increase conditions such as realizing water conservancy, water conservancy mechanization, raising a large number of pigs, accumulating fertilizer, and reforming the cultivation system, several important factors must also be considered. The first is the increase in agricultural mechanization; the second is that the state can supply more chemical fertilizers; the third is the improvement of the leadership level and the strengthening of the leadership force at all levels; the fourth is that the ideological awareness and labor attitude of the masses will be further improved, and the management and operation of agriculture will be completely on the right track, and the experience will be even richer. Based on these conditions, the delegates believed that the county was confident in achieving a cotton yield of 110 jin per mu and a grain yield of 500 jin per mu in 1962. By 1967, it could reach the target of 150 jin of cotton per mu and 640 jin of grain per mu.

    At this time, there was another burst of excitement in the room. Some suggested to the provincial Party Congress that the production target for the Jinan region in 1967 be raised from 420 jin to 500 jin; some encouraged Secretary Lu to talk about the enthusiasm of the masses in Jieyu County for increasing production and the production increase targets discussed by the delegation when speaking at the conference. The loud and confident laughter of the people flew out of the sun-dappled, half-closed and half-open window.

　　他们的劲头哪里来？
　　——中共山西省第一届代表大会第二次会议一斑——
  　本报记者　吕建中
    太原市井州饭店“四三三”号房间里，这几天显得格外活跃。出席省党代表会议的解虞县的代表们，在这里根据四十条纲要的精神和省委初步拟订的全省十二年农业发展规划（修正草案）讨论自己县里的增产指标。
    代表们从省委的规划中的增产措施等方面得到启发，但觉得规划里面有几个重要数字还不够理想：
    全省到1967年粮食平均亩产量，由1955年的一百二十七斤增加到三百一十五斤，其中晋南地区由1955年的一百五十八斤增加到四百二十斤。
    全省到1967年棉花平均亩产量（皮棉），由1955年的三十八斤增加到八十斤，其中晋南地区由1955年的四十一点五斤增加到八十六斤。
    省委把这个规划草案提交这次党代表会讨论之前，曾经过几次讨论和修正。在讨论当中，有的同志对增产指标持谨慎态度是有他的理由的，这就是山西省过去几年来的粮食产量总是很不稳定：1954年的单位面积产量为一百三十三点九斤，1955年为一百二十七点五斤，1956年为一百五十斤，1957年为一百二十点六斤。造成产量不稳定的原因很多，但其中最主要的就是水利跟不上——全省六千八百三十四万亩耕地面积中，现在只有水浇地一千万亩左右。1955年和1957年的两次严重减产，都主要是旱灾造成的。
    不过，解虞县的代表们觉得省委这个指标不够理想，也是有他们的理由的。他们的增产劲头很大，这种劲头主要来自正在结合讨论四十条纲要大搞生产建设的全县十几万群众。
    代表们在讨论当中认为，解虞县和全省的情况一样，水利问题也是全县增产的主要关键。解虞县河流稀少，地下水源却很充足。解放前全县只有一万多亩水浇地。解放后，特别是经过高级合作化后第一个冬春的兴修水利高潮，全县水地发展到二十六万多亩，使1956年从旱灾中夺得了丰收。最近，他们又在全县范围内掀起了一个“白天千部机器响，夜晚万盏灯火明”的冬季生产高潮。花果山农业社辩倒了保守思想以后，社员们要以“孙悟空大闹天宫”的气魄，使“低水向高流，遍浇花果山”。习苏农业社在11月7日那天完成了两条大水渠，一条定名“十月革命渠”，另一条定名“辩论渠”。在辩论中，有的社员提出节约粮食，支援夜间打井的人；有的社员把准备盖房子的钱投到社里搞水利建设。许多地方群众自动组织勘察组上山下地找水源，并展开挑战竞赛，热烈异常。
    群众这种征服自然的排山倒海的气势和大闹生产的劲头，给代表们增添了勇气和智慧。在这次会议上讨论制订全县增产指标的时候，他们明确了：只要坚持贯彻“因地制宜，全面规划，小型为主，中型为辅”的方针，就可以把全县群众动员和组织起来，发展水利就可以做到又多又快又好又省。参加这次党代表会的红星农业社主任罗成鄎和燎原农业社主任高鸣钟，就曾根据这个方针创造了很好经验。红星社在中条山脚下，他们采用挖泉截流，修建水库的办法，不到一年工夫用三千二百元投资，就发展了水地五千九百多亩。燎原农业社地处平原，他们经过全面规划，采用利用旧井、打新井、挖渠的办法，建立灌溉网，并采用机械抽水，两年工夫就提前实现了全社水利化，比原来的计划节省了投资二十八万多元。根据这些，解虞县的代表们对全县今冬明春把水浇地扩大到四十万亩、到1959年底实现全县水利化这个计划充满了信心。
    代表们还认为，随着水利的发展，肥料也必须跟上去。这一点，全县群众在辩论四十条纲要当中也挖掘出好多肥源，而其中更重要的一项措施则是大量发展养猪。全县明年平均每亩土地施肥量可比今年增加40％，再加上耕作制度的改革和耕作技术的提高，全县1958年粮食的平均亩产量可由今年的一百八十四斤提高到二百六十二斤，棉花可由今年的五十五斤提高到七十斤，争取达到八十斤。连同其它农副业收入，明年全县每人的纯收入可由今年的九十七元提高到三百三十五点一元，比合作化前富裕中农每人平均收入一百零三元提高了142.1％。
    在一年当中使全县每个农民的收入由低于富裕中农一跃而超过富裕中农一倍多，这样的大跃进是可能的吗？群众的力量鼓舞了他们的信心。解虞县的农民群众曾把大量的收入投入了水利建设。现在全县有水车六千多部，锅驼机、柴油机一千多部，平均每三十三户就有一部水利机器。这些机器大部是今年各农业社自己筹资买来的，并在今年抗旱中发挥了巨大的效能。这又给代表们一个十分重要的启示：只要大力发动群众，紧紧依靠群众，就可以创造奇迹。
    代表们在辩论全县1960年的增产指标问题的时候，斗争十分激烈。那时候，全县已经水利化了，养猪积肥也有了加倍的发展，加上全省十万名干部全部下放和回乡生产以后，农业战线上的领导力量也将大大加强，这样就使增产条件更加优越。然而在进一步改革耕作制度，尤其是扩大复播面积这项重要措施上，却发生了争论，有的代表赞同，有的表示怀疑。代表刘生溪举出他所领导的星火社为例子，这个社每个劳力平均十三亩地，九百亩复播，七百亩棉花，春秋两季劳畜力都十分紧张，顾不过来。这的确是个带有普遍性的实际问题。可是大家从辩论中终于找到解决办法。其一，是从制度上加强劳动管理，从思想教育上端正社员的劳动态度，挖掘社员的劳动潜力。其二，更基本的解决办法，就是实现水利机械化。在这方面代表高鸣钟所领导的燎原农业社就是一面镜子。这个社的劳力原来也很感不足，可是他们装置了柴油机、锅驼机各一部，除带动水泵浇地两千亩外，还带动十八部轧花车、六部脱绒机和一座油磨、钢磨，这不仅使全社的棉籽可以全部自己加工，同时榨油和社员磨面也用机器代替了。代表们认为燎原社的做法完全有条件在全县其它农业社里推广。
    经过一阵辩论，大家认为1960年全县复种面积扩大到二十五万亩是完全能够做到的。至于产量，代表当中有两个是今年部分土地千斤粮和两个大面积百斤棉的农业社的领导者，他们实现这种高额纪录的条件和措施，并不比上述1960年的增产条件好。据此，代表们最后讨论决定，全县1960年棉花亩产一百斤以上。粮食平均亩产量四百三十六斤。这就是说：省委给晋南地区提出的十二年指标，他们1960年就能超额完成！
    上述指标一经确定，全体代表大为振奋，县委书记陆达同志好容易才抑制住了大家的喧嚷声，他要大家再沉下心来考虑1962年和1967年的指标。大家觉得突破了1960年这个“大关口”，后面就好讨论得多了。他们认为，再往后，尤其是到1967年，除了上述实现水利化、水利机械化、大量养猪、积肥和改革耕作制度等增产条件以外，有几个重要因素还必须考虑进去，一是耕作机械化增多；二是国家能更多的供应化学肥料；三是各级领导水平的提高和领导力量的加强；四是群众思想觉悟和劳动态度将有更大地提高，农业的经营管理将完全纳入正轨，经验也更加丰富了。根据这些条件，代表们认为全县有把握在1962年达到棉花亩产一百一十斤，粮食亩产五百斤。到1967年，就可达到棉花亩产一百五十斤，粮食亩产六百四十斤的指标。
    这时候，房间里又是一阵热闹，有的提议向省党代会建议，把晋南地区1967年的产量指标由四百二十斤提高到五百斤；有的鼓励陆书记在大会发言时，把解虞县群众那股增产劲头和代表团讨论出来的这个增产指标好好讲一讲。人们响亮而自信的笑声，阵阵飞出那阳光斑斓的，半掩半开着的窗口。
