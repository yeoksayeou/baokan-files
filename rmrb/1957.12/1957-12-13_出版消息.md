    Two Photography Art Selections
    "Selection of News Photography" collects over a hundred representative works by Chinese news photographers. These works reflect many great scenes of China's socialist transformation and the tremendous victories achieved in economic construction in 1956.
    "Selection of Photographic Art" is compiled from a hundred photos carefully selected from the photographic art exhibition jointly held by the People's Daily and other units in 1955. It includes works from the Anti-Japanese War, the Liberation War, and after liberation. Some of these photos were taken under very difficult conditions, making them valuable historical revolutionary materials. Both of these photography selections have been published by Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House. (Song Qi)
    Reference Materials for the Study of the 1911 Revolution History
    "Early Writings on the 1911 Revolution" and "Historical Materials on the 1911 Revolution" will be published by the Science Press. These are two important reference materials for the study of the 1911 Revolution history.
    "Early Writings on the 1911 Revolution" is a memoir by Yang Yuru, who personally participated in the Wuchang Uprising. It mainly records the revolutionary activities in the Hubei area on the eve of the 1911 Revolution and the course of the Wuchang Uprising. "Historical Materials on the 1911 Revolution" was compiled by Zhang Guogan. The book was drafted in 1931 and compiled after a long period of collecting and correcting. The book adopts more than a hundred kinds of records from various sources and verifies them with official documents from the North and South, as well as discussions with the parties involved.

    "People's China Reports" Resumes Publication
    In order to meet the needs of Esperantists at home and abroad, the All-China Esperanto League has decided to resume publication of the original Esperanto publication "People's China Reports" and change it to a bimonthly publication by the League. The content of the journal will basically remain a comprehensive publication, but with an emphasis on cultural aspects. It will use short, lively literary features, novels, poems, etc. to introduce the life, culture, art, and economic construction of the Chinese people to foreign Esperantists. Basic knowledge about China, the situation of ethnic minorities, the development of the Esperanto movement, and cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries will also be regularly reported. The resumed issue has now been published and is soliciting subscriptions from Esperantists at home and abroad.
