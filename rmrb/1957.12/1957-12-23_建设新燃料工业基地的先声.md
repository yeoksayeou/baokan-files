Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 22nd: Extensive exploration has been carried out during the First Five-Year Plan on twelve coalfields with abundant reserves located west of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway and north and south of the Yellow River in Henan Province. According to preliminary data, the reserves of these coalfields are estimated at more than 20 billion tons. If judged according to geological conditions, the total amount of coal may be several times greater.

The quality of the coal in these coalfields is generally very good. The Pingdingshan, Linru Baofeng, and Yiluo coalfields have prime coking coal that can be used for coking alone, as well as a large amount of rich coal. This rich coal, combined with the lean coal found in coalfields such as Hebi, can be used to produce high-quality coke. In addition to a considerable amount of coking coal, the Yumi, Xinmian, and Dengfeng coalfields also contain a large amount of power coal. The coal mined from the Jiaozuo coalfield, which is famous for its civil-use coal, can also be used for general industry.

Yaerxia Oilfield Ready for Exploitation

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 22nd: The newly explored Yaerxia oil reservoir at the Yumen Oilfield has been proven to be an oilfield with exploitable value.

According to the person in charge of the geological department of the Yumen Oilfield: the Yaerxia oil reservoir, if further exploration confirms the reserves next year, can be exploited.

Drilling workers will drill a new batch of exploratory wells here next year to determine the oil-bearing area and oil content of this oil reservoir, and to explore a certain amount of recoverable crude oil reserves for production.

The drilling workers currently working in Yaerxia are working hard to test the oil of the completed exploratory wells. Engineering and technical personnel and production management personnel from the entire mine are also studying the well location layout of the new exploratory wells, striving to start drilling the first batch of new exploratory wells within December this year.

Yaerxia is not far from the Laojunmiao oilfield of the Yumen Oilfield. In 1956, the first exploratory well drilled here by the drilling workers of the Yumen Oilfield gushed a large amount of crude oil from 2,500 meters underground. This year, the drilling workers drilled another batch of new exploratory wells here, of which eight have already shown oil, and one well also gushed a large amount of crude oil in October this year.

Opening up New Petroleum Exploration Bases
Exploration Pioneers Head to Guizhou and Hubei

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 22nd: Two exploration teams from the Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau have recently left Chengdu for Guizhou, Hubei, and other provinces to open up new petroleum exploration bases.

These provinces are regions that Chinese and Soviet petroleum geological experts believe have oil-bearing prospects. In the past, many oil and gas seepages were discovered in the Guizhou area. Since 1956, the Petroleum General Survey Team of the Ministry of Geology has successively discovered many structures that may store oil. According to existing data, several places in Guizhou already have the conditions for further detailed geological surveys and detailed measurements. Certain strata in the Hubei area have now been confirmed as the most promising rock formations for storing oil; especially since the transportation in this area is inconvenient and the economic position is very advantageous, it will be of great significance to carry out exploration work as soon as possible and understand the resources to support my country's socialist industrialization.

Supporting the Great Leap Forward in Agricultural Production
Exploring the Anthracite Belt in Southwest China

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 22nd: The Southwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau has decided to strengthen the exploration of the anthracite belt in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan to support agricultural production in the Sichuan Basin and create conditions for the rational use of industrial coal.

The Sichuan-Guizhou-Yunnan anthracite belt starts from Songkan River near Qijiang, Sichuan, in the east, and extends to Yanjin, Yunnan, in the west, with a total length of about 360 kilometers, passing through more than ten counties. A comprehensive survey was carried out last year and this year. Preliminary estimates indicate that the minable Permian coal seam is two to four meters thick, with a total reserve of 5 billion tons.

    建设新燃料工业基地的先声
    河南煤藏量二百多亿吨
    据新华社郑州22日电  分布在河南省境内京广铁路以西、黄河南北两岸的十二个储量丰富的煤田，在第一个五年计划期间普遍地进行了勘查。根据初步掌握的资料计算，这些煤田的藏量有二百多亿吨。如果按地质情况来推断，全部的煤量可能还要大好几倍。
    这些煤田的煤质，一般都很好。平顶山、临汝宝丰、宜洛等煤田，有能单独炼焦的主焦煤，也有大量的肥煤。这种肥煤同鹤壁等煤田蕴藏的瘦煤配合起来，可以炼出质量很好的焦炭。禹密、新渑、登封等煤田，除藏有不少的焦煤以外，还有大量的动力用煤。以民用煤著称的焦作煤田开采出的煤炭，也可以用于一般工业。
    鸭儿峡油田即可开采
    据新华社兰州22日电  玉门油矿新勘探的鸭儿峡油藏已经探明是一个有开采价值的油田。
    据玉门油矿地质部门的负责人谈：鸭儿峡这一新油藏如果经过明年更进一步探明储量以后，即可进行开采。
    钻井工人明年将在这里钻凿一批新探井，以探明这个油藏的储油面积和含油情况，并且要探出一定数量的原油可采储量以备生产。
    目前在鸭儿峡工作的钻井工人，正在紧张地对已钻成的探井进行试油。全矿有关的工程技术人员和生产管理负责人员，也在研究新探井的井位布局，争取第一批新探井能在今年12月内开钻。
    鸭儿峡距玉门油矿老君庙油田不远。1956年，玉门油矿钻井工人在这里钻的第一口探井，从二千五百公尺的地下大量喷出了原油；今年钻井工人又在这里钻了一批新探井，其中有八口都已见油，有一口井今年十月份也大量喷出了原油。
    开辟新的石油勘探基地
    勘探尖兵开往贵州湖北
    据新华社成都22日电  四川石油勘探局的两支勘探大队最近陆续从成都前往贵州、湖北等省份，开辟新的石油勘探基地。
    这几个省份，是中苏石油地质专家认为具有含油远景的地区。在过去的年代里，贵州地区曾经有众多的油气苗被发现。从1956年开始，地质部石油普查大队又相继发现了许多可能储集石油的构造。根据现有资料，贵州有好几个地方已经具备进一步进行地质详查和细测的条件。湖北地区的某些地层，现在已经被证实是储藏石油最有希望的岩系；特别是这个地区的交通不便，经济位置非常优越，因此及早展开勘探工作，摸清资源，对支援我国的社会主义工业化建设将有很大作用。
    支援农业生产大跃进
    西南勘探无烟煤带
    据新华社重庆22日电  西南煤田地质勘探局决定加强对川、黔、滇无烟煤带的勘探工作，支援四川盆地的农业生产，并为合理使用工业用煤创造条件。
    川、黔、滇无烟煤带，东起四川綦江附近的松坎河，西至云南盐津，全长约三百六十公里，中经十多个县，在去年和今年进行了全面踏勘。初步估计，可采的二叠纪煤层有二到四公尺厚，总储量达五十亿吨。
