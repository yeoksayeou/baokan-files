    Egypt's "Ball Fish"

    According to a recent issue of the Soviet magazine "Around the World," there is a strange fish in Egypt called the "ball fish," which has a marvelous way of defending itself against enemies. When attacked by a shark or in danger, it quickly sucks in seawater. As the seawater passes through its esophagus, it is decomposed and generates gas due to the action of a special gland. After the "ball fish" inflates its entire body with air, it quickly floats to the surface of the sea, looking just like a round ball.

    Generally, ferocious fish are disappointed and retreat when they encounter the inflated "ball fish" because they cannot swallow this "ball" into their esophagus. Even if the most gluttonous shark manages to swallow the "ball fish" whole, it is tantamount to a death sentence. The "ball fish" will swell even larger inside the shark's belly, and the sharp spines on its abdomen will mercilessly pierce the shark's stomach wall, thus causing the shark to die.

    Therefore, in the ocean, many ferocious fish avoid the "ball fish" when they encounter it.

    埃及的“球鱼”
    据苏联最近一期的“环球”杂志报道，埃及有一种怪鱼名叫“球鱼”，它有一种奇妙的防御敌人的方法。当它遭到鲨鱼的袭击或遇到危险的时候，它便迅速吸食海水，海水经过食道时，由于一种特殊的分泌腺的作用，便发生分解和产生气体。“球鱼”的全身被鼓足气后便迅速浮到海面，活像个圆晃晃的皮球。
    一般凶猛的鱼类碰到鼓足气的“球鱼”时便扫兴而退，因为它不能将这个“圆球”吞进食道里去。即使最贪食的鲨鱼能够将“球鱼”囫囵地吞噬进去，也等于被宣判死刑。“球鱼”在鲨鱼肚里将涨得更大，它腹部的锐利的刺将会毫不容情地扎入鲨鱼的胃壁，于是这条鲨鱼便一命呜呼。
    因此，在海洋里，很多凶猛的鱼类遇到“球鱼”时，总是回避它的。
