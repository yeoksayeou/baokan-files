    "Our sideline business is doing well"
    "Our sideline business is doing so well! The sheep are fat, and the geese are strong." This year, the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Hong'an County, Hubei Province, has an income of more than 30,000 yuan from sideline businesses alone. The poultry and livestock of this cooperative are raised by the members in a decentralized manner. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Jiuling)
