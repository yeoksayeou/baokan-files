　　Taming the Mang River
　　By our reporter Shang Kai
    Water cellars accumulate water step by step, terraces retain mud section by section
    Passing through a group of reservoirs and reaching the mountainside of Nanling, the area is covered with layers of terraces, which, according to the local people, is already "terraced." From a distance, it looks like a beautiful pattern composed of countless lines. Wu Chaoxin, the Party Branch Secretary of the Beipo Agricultural Cooperative in Gengzhang Township, said, "This area has a high altitude, low water level, and a particularly scarce water source. We can't build reservoirs or dig wells. In case of drought, it's difficult to even get drinking water for people and livestock." After listening to Wu Chaoxin's introduction, we were completely puzzled—because since the beginning of autumn this year, there has been a general lack of rain, and autumn crops have been reduced in many areas, and winter wheat cannot be sown. However, the agricultural cooperatives in the Nanling area have all achieved a bumper harvest of autumn crops, and the winter wheat in front of us is lush, dense, and spread out in the soil ridges like a horse's mane. Where did this water come from?
    In order to reveal this mystery to us, Wu Chaoxin led us to visit their terraces. These terraces have a common feature, they are high around the perimeter and low in the center. The local people call this "arc-shaped terraces," which can retain rainwater, conserve moisture, and resist drought. In larger plots, one or two earthen ridges are built in the middle, which the local people call "earthen bags." When there is heavy rain, it can slow down the speed of the water flow, allowing the water to slowly seep into the ground or flow out in a roundabout way, avoiding damage to the field surface. At the head of each terrace, there are drainage outlets made of bricks and stones, which the masses call "water winnows." Wu Chaoxin said that in the past, these were all flat, water-passing terraces with very low water storage capacity. In the event of a heavy rain, the ridges would collapse, and the soil and water would be lost. After liberation, a series of measures such as cutting inward and padding outward, repairing ridges and building embankments, and strengthening and consolidating the ridges were carried out in a planned way, which is how it became like this. This kind of terrace has a high water storage capacity. According to the observation results of the rainy season this year on an area of ​​6,000 square meters: the daily rainfall was 81 mm, and the hourly rainfall was 51 mm. The rainwater never left the field and completely seeped into the ground. Therefore, the drought resistance capacity has been greatly enhanced. Gengzhang Township has more than 1,000 mu of dry land. Since the beginning of autumn this year, after more than 70 days of severe drought, it has not been irrigated once, and each mu still yielded 120 jin of grain.
    We followed Wu Chaoxin and continued to climb up the terraces one level at a time. Every few steps on the ground or roadside, there is a round hole. Picking up a stone and throwing it down, there is a buzzing echo, indicating that it is already full of water. This is the famous water cellar in the Mang River basin. This kind of water cellar is made very carefully, and is divided into cave type and urn type. It is small at the opening and large in the belly. The cellar wall and bottom are rammed with a mixture of lime, fine sand, and red clay to prevent leakage. Next to the cellar opening, there is a sedimentation pool. When it rains, rainwater flows into the sedimentation pool, is sedimented, flows into the water cellar, and then is covered and sealed. According to Wu Chaoxin, each water cellar can store 500 to 1,000 dan of water, which can irrigate one to two mu of land to protect seedlings during drought.
    The water cellar was successfully tested in Gengzhang Township, and then promoted from here to the outside. Now, in the Mang River basin, more than 6,500 such water cellars have been developed, which can intercept more than 3 million dan of floodwater, solving the drought problem of terraces in hilly areas, and ensuring increased agricultural production. Three agricultural cooperatives in Gengzhang Township have a total of 1,300 water cellars. This year, they used cellar water to plant and protect seedlings. The yield of 2,400 mu of autumn crops reached more than 300 jin per mu, and every household also planted three or four fen of vegetables using cellar water. The yield of radishes and cabbages per mu reached more than 4,000 jin, fundamentally changing the past situation of not being able to eat fresh vegetables for many years. The masses happily said, "Water cellars save labor and money, store water in times of flood and irrigate in times of drought, and it is not difficult to get water for people, horses, washing, and planting."
    The Toad Bay of many years has become a Land of Rice and Grain
    We detoured to the north bank of the Mang River in the middle reaches. From here to the north, all the way to the foot of the distant Kong Mountain, the square plots of land are arranged so neatly. Now, the rice has been harvested, the water in the paddy fields has been drained, and the lush wheat seedlings have covered the ground again. In the warm sunshine and the blue sky, flocks of white and gray pigeons are flying, displaying a picture of the autumn harvest in the countryside. Here, we visited several villages such as Yantou and Shuitun. The members of the agricultural cooperative are threshing rice on the threshing floor. Taking advantage of their rest, they all sat down together on the ground to talk. According to their rough estimate, this year's rice is growing well, with a hope of 250 to 300 jin per mu. Coupled with the wheat harvested this summer, the yield of wheat and rice per mu will reach more than 400 jin, an increase of more than two times compared to before 1953.
    "What was the situation here before?" Mentioning the past aroused many painful memories. In the past, this area was low-lying and accumulated water all year round, turning into a saline-alkali swamp, covering an area of more than 120,000 mu. It was a famous "Toad Bay." Between summer and autumn, rain and mountain floods caused floods in front of and behind the villages!
    After liberation, the Party and the People's Government led the masses here to successively excavate three large drainage canals leading to the Mang River and more than 100 large and small drainage ditches, eliminating excess accumulated water. Then, the tributary of the Mang River, the Zhulong River, was dredged. Then, more than 150 irrigation canals were opened on the Zhulong River, and bridge culverts and sluices were renovated, so that it could not only drain water, but more importantly, store water for irrigation. This series of measures freed approximately 80,000 mu of cultivated land from waterlogging. For places that are too low-lying, such as Shuitun and Yantou, the water of the Zhulong River is used to implement rice-wheat double cropping. Every early summer, after the wheat is harvested, water is immediately released to transplant rice seedlings, and after the autumn rice matures, water is drained to plant wheat again. In recent years, the yield of wheat and rice double cropping in this area has reached about 400 jin per mu.
    Leaving Shuitun and walking east along the road, there is a series of dense villages such as Ximatou, Dongmatou, and Miaodian. Here, we visited the great creation of improving saline-alkali swamps—ditch-furrowed terraced fields.
    The boundless cultivated land is divided into rows of rectangular plots of two or three mu each. One end of the plot is connected to the road, and the other three sides are dug into small ditches more than five feet wide and four feet deep. The small ditches are connected to each other and connected to branch and main ditches, and finally lead to the drainage ditch. There is always water in the ditches, and fish are raised and lotus roots are planted. Now, although there are only some withered lotus stalks left in the turbid ditches, one can imagine how charming the scenery would be here in the summer when the lotus flowers are in full bloom!
    Someone asked about the role of ditch-furrowed terraced fields, and Zhang Xiufu, the director of the Matou Agricultural Cooperative, who guided us to visit, gave a detailed explanation. He said that this area has approximately 30,000 mu of land. Due to year-round water accumulation and rising groundwater levels, the land is saline-alkali. Drainage is impossible if dry crops are planted, and water sources are insufficient if water crops are planted. The ditch-furrowed terraced fields precisely solve this contradiction. Digging ditches raises the field surface, lowers the groundwater level, and uses ditches to drain water in times of waterlogging, and uses ditch water to irrigate in times of drought. The "Toad Bay" of many years has become a land of rice and grain with guaranteed harvest regardless of drought or flood. This year, the Matou Agricultural Cooperative harvested more than 400 jin of grain per mu of terraced fields without applying one jin of fertilizer. In addition, 20,000 jin of fish can be caught and 100,000 jin of lotus roots can be harvested.
    The laughter of the people on both sides of the Mang River
    We boarded the Gudanjiezhi Sluice on the lower reaches of the Mang River. The rolling river water impacted the sluice gate, making a thunderous roar. The Gudanjiezhi Sluice, near Gudanzhen in Meng County, is the dividing point between the middle and lower reaches of the Mang River. Standing on this tall sluice gate, the shape of the Mang River can be seen very clearly. From here upwards, the riverbed is wide and can accommodate a flow of 800 to 1,000 cubic meters per second; from here downwards, the riverbed suddenly narrows and can only accommodate a flow of 100 to 150 cubic meters per second. The entire river is large at the top and small at the bottom, very much like a funnel. Therefore, the dikes and embankments below Gudanjiezhi on the Mang River have almost collapsed year after year, and 80,000 mu of fertile land on both sides have often been flooded. There was a saying circulating in this area: "Jiyuan thunder and lightning, Meng County frightened to death."
    Now, the results achieved in the overall planning and comprehensive management of the Mang River are also concentratedly demonstrated here. Fan Mingde, the director of the Mang River Irrigation Administration Bureau, said that before the management, in the flood season of 1953, the upstream rainfall was 540 mm, and the Mang River flow was 500 cubic meters per second. It had breached twice in Wutong Village below Gudanjiezhi; after the management, in the flood seasons of 1956 and 1957, the upstream rainfall was 560 mm to 600 mm, and the Mang River only had a flow of 70 cubic meters per second, a reduction of more than 86%. In particular, after two flood diversion and irrigation control gates were built in Guadan and Liuwan below Guadan, the gates can be closed to divert water to irrigate 50,000 mu of fertile land in times of drought, and the Mang River flow can be controlled below 100 cubic meters per second in the flood season, and it can be safely discharged downstream. In the event of a particularly large flood flow, it can also be diverted eastward through the flood diversion channel, which basically eliminates the threat of Mang River floods to the downstream.
    Walking down the sluice gate and strolling on the embankment of the lower reaches of the Mang River, the clear river water flows quietly forward, and fat cattle and sheep are grazing along the embankment slopes. We casually chatted with an old shepherd. This old man's surname is Wu, he is 67 years old this year, and he is from Duanchu Village under the embankment. The topic naturally turned to the Mang River. The old man's conversation was very humorous. He said, "The Mang River is like a big bully. I have lived for more than 60 years and I don't remember it doing a good thing. Flooding is because of it, and drought is also because of it. Since liberation, the Communist Party has transformed it into a good person, and it has started doing good things again." The old man raised his sheep-driving whip and pointed to both sides of the Mang River and said, "See it?" I saw that on the boundless wilderness, between the crisscrossing channels, wheat fields were tightly connected to vegetable gardens, and vegetable gardens were tightly connected to wheat fields... The famous high-yield area of Meng County with thousands of jin of grain and ten thousands of jin of vegetables per mu refers to this place. The old man said, "This is all irrigated with the water of the Mang River! In the past, people watched the crops dry up alive, and no one dared to move it. Now, how much water you want, you get how much water, it's really more obedient than your own son!" The old man laughed loudly at this point. How familiar this laughter is, we have heard such laughter everywhere on both sides of the Mang River. (The end)

　　驯服漭河
　　本报记者　商恺
    水窖步步蓄水  梯田节节拦泥
    穿过水库群，到了南岭的半山腰上，这里全是层层叠叠的梯田，按照当地群众的说法，已经是“梯田化”了。远远望去，像是由无数线条组成的美丽图案。耿章乡背坡农业社的党支部书记吴朝信同志介绍说：“这一带地势高，水位低，水源特别缺乏，既不能修库，又不能打井，遇旱别说浇地，人畜吃水也很困难。”听了吴朝信的介绍，简直使我们迷惑不解了——因为今年自入秋以来普遍缺雨，许多地区的秋作物减产，冬小麦无法播种，可是，南岭一带的农业社秋作物都获得了丰收，面前的冬小麦，又是青旺旺稠密密的，像马鬃一样铺展在土垅里，这是那里来的水呢？
    为了给我们揭开这个奥秘，吴朝信领我们参观了他们的梯田。这些梯田有一个共同的特点，都是周边高，里边低，当地群众把这叫做“弧形梯田”，它能拦蓄雨水，保墒抗旱。在较大的地块里，中间又筑有一道或两道土埂，当地群众把这叫作“土布袋”，在雨水较大时，它可以减缓水流的速度，使水慢慢渗入地下或迂回流出，避免冲毁田面。在每一层梯田地头上，有用砖石修成的排水口，群众叫做“水簸箕”。吴朝信说，过去这里都是平面过水梯田，蓄水能力很低，一遇暴雨，堎堰坍塌，水土流失。解放以后，有计划地进行了里切外垫，修堎垒堰，培埂加固等一系列的措施，才变成了这个样子。这种梯田蓄水能力很高，根据今年雨季在六千平方公尺的地面上观测结果：日降雨量八十一公厘，时降雨量五十一公厘，雨水始终没有出田，完全渗入了地下。因此，大大增强了抗旱能力。耿章乡有一千多亩旱田，今年入秋以来，经过七十多天的大旱，一水未浇，每亩还打了一百二十斤粮食。
    我们跟着吴朝信攀登着一级一级的梯田继续往上走。在地头或路边隔不了几步远，便有一个圆洞洞，顺手拾起一个石子投下去，传来嗡嗡的回声，说明里边已经蓄满了水。这就是漭河流域著名的水窖。这种水窖做的很讲究，分窑洞式和瓮式两种。口小，肚大，窖壁和窖底都用三合土（石灰、细砂、红粘土）捶成，防止渗漏。窖口旁边，挖有一个沉淀池，下雨时，雨水流入沉淀池经过沉淀，流入水窖，然后加盖封闭。据吴朝信说，每个水窖能蓄水五百担到一千担，旱时浇地保苗一亩到二亩。
    水窖是在耿章乡试验成功，然后从这里向外推广的。现在，在漭河流域，像这样的水窖已经发展到六千五百多个，可拦蓄洪水三百多万担，解决了丘陵地带梯田的干旱问题，使农业增产获得了保证。耿章乡三个农业社，共有水窖一千三百个，今年用窖水点种保苗，两千四百亩秋作物每亩产量达到三百多斤，而且家家户户都用窖水种上了三四分蔬菜，亩产萝卜、白菜四千多斤，从根本上改变了过去长年吃不上新鲜蔬菜的情况。群众高兴的说：“水窖省工又省钱，涝天蓄水旱浇田，人吃马饮洗衣种菜，样样不作难。”
    多年的蛤蟆湾变成了米粮川
    我们绕到了漭河中游的北岸。从这里往北直到遥远的孔山脚下，一方一方的畦田，排列得那样整齐。现在，稻子已经收割完毕，畦田里的水已经放干，青旺旺的麦苗又铺满了地面。暖和的阳光下，碧蓝的天空里，飞翔着成群的白色和灰色的鸽子，显示了一幅秋日农村的丰收图景。在这里，我们访问了堰头、水屯等几个村子。农业社的社员们正在打禾场上打稻子。趁他们休息的空隙，便一齐席地座谈起来。根据他们粗略地估算，今年水稻生长良好，每亩有二百五十斤到三百斤的希望，再加上今年夏季收获的小麦，每亩麦稻的收获量，将达到四百斤以上，比1953年以前增加了两倍多。
    “从前这里是什么情况呢？”提到过去，又勾引起了他们许多苦痛的回忆。从前，这一带地势低洼，常年积水，变成了盐碱沼泽状态，面积有十二万余亩，是有名的“蛤蟆湾”。夏秋之间，天雨加上山洪，村前村后，一片汪洋！
    解放以后，党和人民政府领导这里的群众，先后开挖了三条通往漭河的大排水渠，一百多条大小排水沟，排除了多余的积水。接着又疏浚了漭河的支流——珠龙河。然后又在珠龙河上开辟了一百五十多条灌溉渠道，装修了桥涵闸口，使它不仅可以排涝，更重要的是可以蓄水浇田。这一系列的措施，使大约八万亩的耕地摆脱涝灾。对于像水屯、堰头这些过分低洼的地方，则利用珠龙河的水，实行稻麦连作。每年夏初，小麦收割以后，立即放水插秧，秋后水稻成熟，再排水种麦。几年以来，这一带的麦稻连作每亩产量均达到四百斤左右。
    出水屯，沿着大路往东走去，是西马头、东马头、苗店等一连串稠密的村庄，在这里，我们参观了改良盐碱沼泽地的伟大创造——沟洫台田。
    一望无际的耕地被划分成为一排一排的二三亩大的长方形地块，地块的一头和大路相连，其余三面都挖成五尺多宽、四尺多深的小沟，小沟和小沟相通，又和支沟干沟相连，最后一并通往排水渠。沟里经常有水，并且养有鱼，种有藕。现在污浊的水沟里，虽然只剩了些残荷败梗，但是，可以想像得出，夏天，当荷花盛开的季节，这里该是一片多么迷人的景色啊！
    有人问到沟洫台田的作用，引导我们参观的马头农业社社长张秀福同志作了详细的说明。他说，这一带大约有三万多亩土地，由于常年积水，地下水位升高，土地盐碱化，种旱作物不能排涝，种水作物水源又不足，而沟洫台田恰恰解决了这个矛盾。挖了沟洫，抬高了田面，降低了地下水位，涝时用沟洫排水，旱时又可以用沟水浇田。多年的“蛤蟆湾”变成了旱涝保收的米粮川。今年，马头农业社每亩台田没施一斤肥料，就收获了四百多斤粮食。另外，还可以捕鱼两万斤，采藕十万斤。
    漭河两岸人民的欢笑
    我们登上了漭河下游的谷旦节制闸，滚滚的河水，冲击着闸门，发出雷鸣般的巨响。谷旦节制闸，在孟县谷旦镇的附近，是漭河中游和下游的分界点。站在这高大闸门上，漭河的形状就看得很清楚了。从这里往上，河床宽阔，能容八百到一千秒公方的流量；从这里往下，河床忽然变窄，只能容纳一百到一百五十秒公方的流量，整条河流上大下小，极像一个漏斗。因此，漭河谷旦以下的堤防，过去几乎是连年溃决，两岸八万亩良田，常常被洪水淹漫。在这一带曾流行着“济源响雷打闪，孟县吓破人胆”的说法。
    现在，对漭河进行全面规划、综合治理所获得的效果，也在这里集中地表现出来了。漭河灌溉管理局局长范明德同志说，在治理前，1953年汛期，上游落雨五百四十公厘，漭河流量是五百秒公方，曾在谷旦以下的梧桐村两次决口；治理后，1956年和1957年汛期，上游落雨五百六十公厘到六百公厘，漭河只出现了七十秒公方的流量，减少了86％以上。特别是在谷旦和谷旦以下的柳湾，修了两座分洪灌溉两用的节制闸以后，旱时可以闭闸引水灌溉五万亩良田，汛期可以将漭河流量节制在一百秒公方以下，安然向下宣泄。遇有特大洪水流量时，还可以通过泄洪道向东分洪，这就基本上消除了漭河洪水对下游的威胁。
    走下节制闸的闸门，漫步在漭河下游的大堤上，清澈的河水静静地向前流着，肥壮的牛羊在沿着堤坡吃草。我们和一个放羊的老伯伯随便攀谈起来。这位老伯伯姓吴，今年六十七岁了，是堤下段渠村人。话题很自然地转到了漭河上去。老伯伯谈话很有风趣，他说：“漭河啊它就像个大恶霸一样，我活了六十多年了，没记得它办过一件好事，淹是因为它，旱也是因为它。自从解放以后，共产党把它改造成了好人，它又办起好事来了。”老伯伯举起他那赶羊的大鞭，指了指漭河两岸说道：“看见了吗？”只见那一望无际的原野上，纵横的渠道之间。麦田紧接着菜园，菜园又紧连着麦田……孟县有名的亩产千斤粮万斤菜的高额丰产区，就是指的这里。老伯伯说：“这都是用漭河的水浇的啊！过去，眼看着庄稼活活地干死，也没人敢动一动它，现在，要多少水就得给多少水，真是比自己的儿子还听话哪！”老伯伯说到这里，大声地笑了起来。这笑声是多么熟悉啊，我们在漭河两岸，到处都听到了这样的笑声。　（续完）
