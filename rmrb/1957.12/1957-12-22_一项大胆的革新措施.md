    A Bold Innovation Measure
    (Our dispatch) Reducing the planting area of wheat, planting more high-yield crops such as corn and potatoes, and increasing the area of multiple cropping are bold innovations in agricultural production increase measures taken by the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region. Wheat and cotton account for a large proportion of the various crops in the farms under the Production and Construction Corps. Every year during the dry season, these two crops need to be irrigated at the same time. However, high-yield crops such as corn and potatoes do not urgently need water during the dry season. The recent meeting of the Party Committee of the Production and Construction Corps decided to take this measure, which will not only solve the water needed for cotton during the dry season, but also increase the grain output of the entire corps.

    一项大胆的革新措施
    本报讯  缩小小麦的播种面积，多种玉米和马铃薯等高产作物，增加复播面积，这是新疆军区生产建设兵团在农业增产措施上一项大胆的革新。小麦和棉花在生产建设兵团所属农场各种作物中占很大的比重。每年到了枯水期，这两种作物却同时需要灌水。而玉米和马铃薯等高产作物在枯水期间却不急需要水。最近召开的生产建设兵团党委会议决心采取这一措施，这样不但枯水期间棉花所需要的水得到解决，全兵团的粮食产量也将上增。
