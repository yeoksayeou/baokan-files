    Academician Nesmeyanov pointed out that the significance of this cooperation agreement far exceeded the scope of cooperation between the two Academies of Sciences. The implementation of this agreement will have a positive effect on the entire process of scientific development in the Soviet Union and China.

    Nesmeyanov thanked the Chinese scientists for their concerted efforts, full of mutual understanding, in the work carried out before the signing of the agreement.

At the same time, this agreement opens up broad prospects for the development of science in our two countries. The agreement, full of fraternal spirit, is an important milestone in the development of Sino-Soviet science, and it pushes the foundation of cooperation and mutual assistance between socialist countries to a new stage.

    The Sino-Soviet Academy of Sciences scientific cooperation agreement stipulates that both parties will jointly conduct research and investigation work, and cooperate with each other in the study of important scientific and technological issues and other scientific issues of mutual interest.

    The 1958 scientific cooperation protocol stipulates specific measures for cooperation in the near future. The protocol attaches great importance to the work of helping each other to train young experts.

    The friendly cooperation between Chinese and Soviet scientists will help solve the most arduous tasks in the national economy and help strengthen the power of the socialist camp. The scientific cooperation documents signed this time demonstrate the ever-closer friendship between the intellectuals and all working people of the two countries. The sacred goal of the brotherly alliance between China and the Soviet Union and the creative unity and cooperation of scientists from the two countries is for the victory of the cause of world peace, for the progress and happiness of mankind.
