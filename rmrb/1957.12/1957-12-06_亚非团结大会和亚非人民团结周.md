Asian-African Solidarity Conference and Asian-African People's Solidarity Week

The "Asian-African People's Solidarity Week," which began on the 1st of this month, and the upcoming "Asian-African Solidarity Conference" on December 26th, are major events in the efforts of the Asian and African people to strive for peace, independence, and strengthened unity and cooperation.

From April 6th to 10th, 1955, 250 representatives from all walks of life in sixteen Asian countries held the "Asian Countries Conference" in New Delhi, the capital of India. The conference adopted resolutions on political, cultural, and scientific issues, which greatly promoted the movement of Asian people to strive for peace, oppose colonialism, and strengthen unity between Asian and African people. The Presidium of the conference also decided to establish the Asian Solidarity Committee to promote and strengthen ties.

In February of this year, a goodwill delegation led by Dr. Anup Singh, Secretary of the Asian Solidarity Committee and a member of the Indian Parliament, visited Egypt. Dr. Singh said at a press conference that if the Egyptian government and people welcomed it, the Asian Solidarity Committee hoped to hold an Asian-African People's Conference in Cairo. Egyptian President Nasser welcomed the holding of this conference in Cairo when he met with the delegation.

On October 21st, the Preparatory Committee for the Asian-African Solidarity Conference held its first meeting in Cairo. Egyptian representative Anwar Sadat was elected as chairman. Representatives from twenty-one Asian and African countries participated in the meeting. The Preparatory Committee recommended that the Asian-African Solidarity Conference be held from December 26th to January 1st of next year, and adopted eight agenda items for the upcoming conference, including issues of universal concern to the Asian and African people such as opposition to colonialism, opposition to racial discrimination, prohibition of testing and use of weapons of mass destruction, and strengthening technical cooperation and cultural exchanges between Asian and African countries. The Preparatory Committee also issued a letter to the Asian and African people, calling on them to be determined to become active and equal participants in all the problems facing humanity today, to abide by the ten principles formulated at the Bandung Conference, and to dedicate themselves to maintaining world peace.

The resolution to convene the Asian-African Solidarity Conference has been widely welcomed and supported. The Preparatory Committee has sent invitations to representatives from approximately forty independent countries in Asia and Africa and approximately twenty colonies and semi-colonies still under colonial enslavement. It is expected that people's representatives from fifty Asian and African countries and regions will participate in this conference.

In order to promote the spirit of the upcoming Asian-African Solidarity Conference, the Secretariat of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference decided to launch an "Asian-African People's Solidarity Week" starting from December 1st. Currently, in Asian and African countries such as the Soviet Union, North Korea, Vietnam, India, and Egypt, the activities of the "Asian-African People's Solidarity Week" have been widely and enthusiastically launched.

　　亚非团结大会和亚非人民团结周
    从本月1日起举行的“亚非人民团结周”和即将于12月26日举行的“亚非团结大会”，是亚非人民在争取和平、独立和加强团结合作的努力中的一件大事。
    1955年4月6日至10日，十六个亚洲国家的二百五十名各界人民代表，在印度首都新德里举行“亚洲国家会议”，会议通过了关于政治、文化、科学等问题的决议，对亚洲人民争取和平、反对殖民主义、加强亚非人民之间团结的运动起了巨大的推动作用。会议主席团还决定成立亚洲团结委员会从事推进和加强联系的工作。
    今年2月由亚洲团结委员会秘书、印度国会议员阿努普·辛格博士率领的一个友好代表团访问了埃及，辛格博士在记者招待会上说，如果埃及政府和人民欢迎的话，亚洲团结委员会希望在开罗举行一次亚非人民会议。埃及总统纳赛尔在接见代表团的时候表示欢迎在开罗举行这个会议。
    10月21日亚非团结大会筹备委员会在开罗举行了第一次会议，埃及代表安瓦尔·萨达特当选为主席，参加这次会议的共有亚非二十一个国家的代表。筹备委员会建议在12月26日到明年1月1日举行亚非团结大会，并通过了为即将举行的会议拟订的八项议程，议程包括反对殖民主义、反对种族歧视、禁止试验和使用大规模毁灭性武器、加强亚非各国技术合作文化交流等亚非人民普遍关切的问题。筹备委员会还发表了告亚非人民书，号召亚非人民决心成为人类今天所面临的所有问题的积极和平等的参加者，信守万隆会议制订的十项原则，致力于维护世界和平。
    召开亚非团结大会的决议受到广泛的欢迎和支持。筹备委员会已经向亚非两洲约四十个独立国家和约二十个仍处于殖民主义奴役下的殖民地和半殖民地的代表发出了邀请。预计参加这次大会的将有亚非五十个国家和地区的人民代表。
    为了宣传即将召开的亚非团结大会的精神，亚非团结大会秘书处决定从12月1日起开展一个“亚非人民团结周”。现在，在苏联、朝鲜、越南、印度、埃及等亚非国家中，“亚非人民团结周”的活动已广泛热烈的展开。　（恕）
