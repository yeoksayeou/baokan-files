　　Quail Eggs Are Not More Nutritious Than Chicken Eggs

　　Recently, in the markets of Beijing and Tianjin, we can see many food stores selling quail eggs. Some food stores even advertise that the nutritional value of one quail egg is about five times that of a chicken egg. Therefore, what exactly is the nutritional value of quail eggs? This is a question that urgently needs to be answered.

　　Comrades from the Nutrition Department of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences recently analyzed the nutritional components of quail eggs and compared them with those of chicken eggs. The results are shown in the following table:

　　From the figures listed in the table above, the nutrient content per 100 grams of the edible portion of quail eggs is very similar to that of chicken eggs, except for riboflavin and nicotinic acid. However, the average weight of each quail egg is about ten grams, with an edible portion of about 86%; the average weight of each chicken egg (medium-sized) is about forty grams, with an edible portion of about 85%. This means that the amount of nutrients provided by one medium-sized chicken egg is approximately equal to that of four quail eggs (except for individual nutrients). Therefore, the claim that the nutritional value of one quail egg is equal to five times that of a chicken egg lacks scientific basis.

　　Domestic biochemists have compared the biological value of quail eggs and chicken eggs. According to the results of animal experiments, no superior qualities of quail eggs have been found compared to chicken eggs.

　　From the analysis of nutritional components and the results of animal experiments, the nutritional value of quail eggs is very similar to that of chicken eggs. Overly promoting the nutritional efficacy of quail eggs can cause misconceptions among the masses, which is not beneficial.

### 鹌鹑蛋的营养价值不比鸡蛋高

　　鹌鹑蛋的营养价值不比鸡蛋高
    近来，在北京和天津的市面上，我们可以看到许多食品商店卖鹌鹑蛋。某些食品商店，甚至宣传一个鹌鹑蛋的营养价值约为鸡蛋的五倍。因此，鹌鹑蛋的营养价值究竟怎样？这是迫切需要答复的一个问题。
    中国医学科学院营养学系的同志，最近对鹌鹑蛋的营养成分作了分析，并且把它和鸡蛋作了比较。现在列表如下：
    从上表所列数字看来，除核黄素和尼克酸外，每百克鹌鹑蛋可食部分的营养素含量和鸡蛋极为近似。但是每个鹌鹑蛋的重量平均约为十克，可食部分约为86％；每个鸡蛋（中型）的重量平均约为四十克，可食部约为85％。这就是说，一个中型鸡蛋所供给的营养素的分量约可抵四个鹌鹑蛋（个别营养素除外）。因此，宣传一个鹌鹑蛋的营养价值等于鸡蛋的五倍的说法，是缺乏科学根据的。
    国内的生物化学家曾经比较过鹌鹑蛋与鸡蛋的生物价值，据动物实验的结果，并未发现鹌鹑蛋比鸡蛋更具有任何优异之处。
    从营养成分的分析和动物实验的结果看来，鹌鹑蛋的营养价值和鸡蛋很相似。过分地宣传鹌鹑蛋的营养功效，会在群众中引起错觉，这没有好处。
