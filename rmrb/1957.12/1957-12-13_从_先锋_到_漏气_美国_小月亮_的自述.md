From "Vanguard" to "Leaky"
——The Autobiography of an American "Little Moon"
Feng Zhidan

What is my real name?
Calling me America's "little moon" is inaccurate because I couldn't even fly up there.
I am lying on the ground at Cape Canaveral, Florida, speaking to the entire planet. Long ago, my master, in order to boast about America's "world leadership," named the rocket carrying me "Vanguard"; later, the Soviet Union took the lead, launching two moons in succession. A kind German gentleman gave me the nickname "Latecomer." Coincidentally, the Russian word "Sputnik" (satellite) and the German word "Spaetnik" (latecomer) happen to be homophones with different meanings. I think this name might be more suitable for my identity, so I decided to rename myself "Latecomer." However, the thrilling event of December 6th happened, and I unfortunately fell headfirst from a few feet high. Then, a kind gentleman living in Manila suggested that my name should be "Pfutnik." "Pfut" in English means "leaky." And some gentlemen in London called me "Ike's Flopnik," "Clunk-nik." I understand that "flop" and "clunk" both mean total failure. Ah, how unfortunate I am! Whose suggestion should I accept? I think, rather than choosing unpleasant names like "Flopnik" or "Clunk-nik," I might as well rename myself "Leaky," which might make my face look a little better.

This is not my fault
From "Vanguard" to "Leaky," it is indeed a major letdown. The American public may blame me for my incompetence. But please don't blame me too much, it's really not my fault. It is the fault of the Pentagon generals and the gentlemen of the U.S. State Department. They outsourced me to the Martin Company, controlled by monopoly capital, and that was the end of it. These fat capitalists are most concerned with profit, they hadn't even sent me to the sky, and they were already publicizing it everywhere, so the price of the New York stock market immediately soared. To be honest, in the United States, the social system maintained by monopoly capital groups stifles the development of science and technology. How can you blame me for "Latecomer" not being able to become a traveler orbiting the Earth and traveling in space today? I completely agree with the opinion of London's "Reynold News": "The real issue lies in the difference between the American system and the Russian system..."

The farce of December 6th
As you all know, I was originally an insignificant sphere weighing only three and a quarter pounds, while the Soviet Union's second satellite weighed more than three hundred times more than me, and its scientific value was many times greater than mine. Therefore, even if I could get into the sky, there would be nothing to be proud of. But completely beyond my expectations, the Pentagon and the U.S. State Department mobilized the entire American propaganda machine, boasting about my sacred "greatness" and great "holiness" every day. These rumor experts and liars sometimes portray me as an unparalleled hero; sometimes they describe me as a captivating beauty.

You see, before the "Vanguard" rocket was launched, the Martin Company published a huge portrait of me. New York newspapers published a picture of my protector, Dr. John Hagen, the head of the American "Vanguard" rocket program, holding a picture of me. Dr. Hagen's assistant, Paul Walsh, triumphantly announced to the world: "The American satellite will broadcast signals to Earth at 108 megacycles, with continuous sound, unlike the beeping sound of the Russian satellite." Heavens, this means that my voice is also much more beautiful than the Soviet satellite. A United Press dispatch described my shape, saying: I am "ingeniously designed and very pleasing to the eye, like an intricate jewel."

Finally, after extensive publicity and repeated delays, December 6th, this unforgettable day, arrived. Nearly two hundred journalists gathered around the launch site, preparing to be the first to send news about my ascent into the sky to the world. In Washington, many reporters were also called into a room in the Pentagon equipped with a telephone line directly to the Cape Canaveral launch base. Everyone held their breath, waiting for the solemn announcement from the Defense Department spokesman standing by the telephone, who was holding a pre-prepared statement. In short, everything was ready...

I thought that since they had praised me to the skies, everything was probably really ready. But things were not like that at all. Only two seconds after I left the launch pad, there was a sudden "boom!" It turned out that the first and second stages of the rocket carrying me had exploded. A fireball emitting thick smoke appeared before my eyes, rising to dozens of feet in the air. In that instant, I felt my whole body lose its balance, and I painfully and sadly fell to the ground at Cape Canaveral, beside me lying the badly damaged beautiful launch pad and the wreckage of the once sparkling "Vanguard" rocket...

Really, the whole course of events seemed like a bizarre nightmare to me. At the beginning, I was捧上了天 (meaning to be elevated to the sky or praised excessively) by those idiots, and now I am倒裁在地上 (meaning to fall headfirst) on the ground, watching as I am about to be abandoned as waste...

Stop boasting so much!
Although an unfortunate fate has befallen me, I still have a few words to say to Mr. Dulles, Mr. McElroy, and all the servants of Wall Street monopoly capital.

I advise you not to shamelessly boast anymore. Your "position of strength" policy and the good dream of the "American Century" have been shattered with the launch of the Soviet satellite and my fall. You say you want to "catch up with the Soviet Union." Of course, the American "satellite" will eventually go to the sky one day. But in any case, the American "satellite" is "Late." When the United States can truly send its own satellite into the sky, the Soviet Union will have leaped far ahead again. You will never be able to catch up with the Soviet Union. The victory of socialist forces over imperialist forces is already a historical certainty. Therefore, I ask you to remember the advice of the French "Aurore" newspaper, you must learn to be "humble" and stop brandishing your claws and teeth. (Attached picture)

### 从“先锋”到“漏气”——美国“小月亮”的自述

　　从“先锋”到“漏气”
　　——美国“小月亮”的自述
　　冯之丹
    我究竟叫什么名字？
    说我是美国的“小月亮”，其实是不确切的，因为我根本没有能飞起来。
    我正躺在美国佛罗里达州卡纳维拉尔角的地上向全地球说话。很久以前，我的主人为了夸耀美国的“世界第一”，曾经给运载我的火箭命名为“先锋”；后来苏联走在前面，接连升起了两个月亮，一位好心的德国先生就给我起了个绰号叫做“迟到”。说也凑巧，俄文的“斯普脱尼克”（卫星）和德文的“斯佩特（迟到）尼克”恰好是两个同音异义的字。我想，这个名字对我的身份可能更相称些，于是我决心改名为“迟到”。但是，12月6日的惊心动魄的事件发生了，我不幸从几英尺高的地方倒栽下来。于是，又有一位住在马尼拉的好心的先生建议我的姓名应该是“普夫脱尼克”。“普夫”，这在英语里是“漏气”的意思。还有伦敦的一些先生们把我称作什么“艾克之砰的尼克”、“叭塌掉了尼克”，我懂得“砰的”和“叭塌”都是完蛋大吉的意思。啊，我是多么不幸！我该接受哪一位先生的建议呢？我想，与其选择“砰的尼克”或者“叭塌尼克”这些难听的名字，倒不如姑且更名为“漏气”吧，这也许能使我的面子好看一些。
    这不是我的过错
    从“先锋”到“漏气”，这的确是一件大煞风景的事情。美国公众也许会责备我的低能。但是，请不要过多地责备我吧，这实在不是我的过错。这是五角大楼的将军们和美国国务院的绅士们的过错。他们把我承包给一个垄断资本控制的马丁公司，事情就算完了。这些脑满肠肥的资本家最关心的是利润，他们还没有送我上天，就已经到处宣扬，于是纽约股票市场的价格立即扶摇直上。老实说，在美国，垄断资本集团所要维护的社会制度窒息着科学技术的发展。我“迟到”今天还不能成为环绕地球、遨游太空的旅行家怎么能怪我呢？我完全同意伦敦“雷诺新闻”的意见：“真正的问题在于美国制度和俄国制度……的不同”。
    十二月六日的丑剧
    你们大家都知道，我本来是一个微不足道的仅仅重三又四分之一磅的圆球，而苏联的第二个卫星要比我重三百多倍，它的科学价值比我要大过不知多少倍。因此，即使我能够上得了天，也没有什么可稀罕的。但是完全出乎我的意料，五角大楼和美国国务院竟然动员了全美国的宣传机器，每天吹嘘我的神圣的“伟大”和伟大的“神圣”。这些造谣专家和骗子手有时把我描写成盖世无双的英雄；有时又把我形容成倾国倾城的美人。
    你们看，在“先锋号”火箭发射以前，马丁公司发表了我的巨幅肖像。纽约的报纸把我的保护人——美国“先锋号”火箭计划的负责人约翰·哈根博士抱着我的图片公诸报端。哈根博士的助手保罗·华尔希洋洋得意地向世界预告说：“美国卫星将以一○八兆周向地球广播信号，声音是连贯的，而不像俄国卫星那样的噼噼声音。”天哪，这是说我的声音也要比苏联的卫星美得多。合众社的电讯描写我的形状说：我是“设计精巧，又很悦目，好像一颗错综复杂的宝石。”
  　终于经过大肆宣传和一再延迟以后，12月6日，这个令人难忘的日子来到了。将近二百名新闻记者聚集在发射场的周围，准备抢先向全世界发出关于我上天的新闻。在华盛顿，也有许多记者被叫进五角大楼一间装有直通卡纳维拉尔角发射基地的电话的房间。大家屏住气息，等候那个守在电话机旁的国防部发言人的庄严的宣告，他手里还拿着一份事先拟就的声明稿。总之，一切都准备好了……。
    我以为他们既然把我吹捧得天花乱坠，大概真的一切都准备好了。可是，事情完全不是那样。在我离开发射架仅仅两秒钟以后，突然一声“轰隆！”原来是运载我的第一节和第二节火箭爆炸了。我的眼前出现了一个冒着浓烟的火球，升腾到数十英尺的空中。就在这一刹那间，我感到全身失去了平衡，我痛苦地、悲哀地摔倒在卡纳维拉尔角的场地上，我的身旁还躺着伤势严重的那个漂亮的发射架和曾经是闪闪发光的“先锋号”火箭的残骸……。
    真的，全部事件的经过对我来说，好像是一场离奇的恶梦。开头，我被那些蠢蛋们捧上了天，而现在我却倒裁在地上，眼看着快要被当作废物遗弃了……。
    少吹些牛吧！
    虽然不幸的命运已降落到我的头上，我还要向杜勒斯先生、麦克艾罗伊先生和华尔街垄断资本的所有的仆役们说几句话。
    我忠告你们不要再厚着脸皮吹牛了。你们的“实力地位”政策和“美国世纪”的好梦已经随着苏联卫星的上天和我的摔倒而幻灭了。你们说要“赶上苏联”。当然，美国的“卫星”终有一天要上天的。但是，无论如何，美国“卫星”是“迟到”了。当美国真正能够送自己的卫星上天的时候，苏联又远远地跃进了。你们永远休想赶过苏联。社会主义力量胜过帝国主义力量，这已经是历史的定局。因此，我请你们记住法国“震旦报”的忠告，你们要学会“谦逊”一些，不要再张牙舞爪了。（附图片）
