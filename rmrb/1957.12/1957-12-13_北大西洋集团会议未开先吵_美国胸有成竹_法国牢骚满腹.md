Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Paris news: Tense preparations for the NATO government heads of state conference came to a standstill on the 10th. The original reason was France's annoyance at the US-UK agreement on nuclear missile bases. The French representative, targeting the US-UK attempt at nuclear monopoly, demanded that the "atomic balance issue be considered at length" at the group's permanent representative council meeting.

NATO officials expect a great deal of debate before an agreement on the agenda of the government heads of state conference can be reached.

Sources say that the disruption occurring less than a week before the start of the heads of state conference is because France believes that the US and UK privately reached an agreement on establishing nuclear missile bases in the UK, leaving aside their "allies." France believes this is an indication that the US and UK intend to forcibly establish a nuclear weapons monopoly within NATO, and is yet another sign of the US and UK forcing their "core leadership" on NATO allies.

France has submitted its "working documents" prepared for the NATO government heads of state conference on the 16th to the group's permanent representative council. These documents reflect France's resistance to the establishment of a US-UK monopoly within NATO.

According to Agence France-Presse, one of France's documents is a memorandum on "policy interdependence," which requires "a certain degree of coordination" of the policies of NATO member states; another essentially requires the United States to open up atomic secrets. None of the three memoranda mention the issue of establishing American missile launch sites on French territory.

Washington News: US Secretary of State Dulles said at a press conference on the 10th that the purpose of the United States at the upcoming NATO high-level conference is to cope with the "separatist forces" of NATO, to "revitalize the spirit of this organization," and to "restore the feeling that people believe NATO is necessary." He admitted that the United States is "trying to do a very difficult job."

Dulles said that he hopes that the "most important result" of this conference will be that NATO member states "re-accept and recommit to the principle of interdependence." He said that the United States has planned a whole set of important decisions for the conference. He admitted that it would "detract" from the sovereignty of the allies.

According to the Associated Press, Washington authoritative sources said on the 11th that the United States is studying how to closely link the NATO alliance with the Rio Treaty Organization (Organization of American States).

Strengthening the connection between these two groups is part of the US-planned grand plan to bring together all Western military groups. The Associated Press reported that the United States intends to submit this plan to the upcoming NATO government heads of state conference for discussion.

### 北大西洋集团会议未开先吵  美国胸有成竹　法国牢骚满腹

　　北大西洋集团会议未开先吵
    美国胸有成竹　法国牢骚满腹
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：巴黎消息：为北大西洋集团政府首脑会议进行的紧张的准备工作在10日陷于停滞。原由是法国对美英关于核导弹基地协议的恼火情绪，法国代表在这个集团的常任代表理事会上针对着美英核垄断的企图，要求“从长计议原子平衡问题”。
    北大西洋集团的官员预料，还需要经过很大一番争论，才能就政府首脑会议的议程达成协议。
    有消息说，在离首脑会议开会不到一个星期的时候发生这种波折，是因为法国认为，美英两国撇开它们的“盟国”而私下达成在英国建立核导弹基地的协议，这是美英两国要在北大西洋集团内强行建立核武器垄断的表示，而且是强制北大西洋盟国接受美英两国的“核心领导”的又一标志。
    法国已经把它为16日开会的北大西洋集团政府首脑会议准备的“工作文件”提交给这个集团的常任代表理事会。这些文件反映了法国对美英两国在北大西洋集团内部建立美英垄断地位的反抗。
    据法新社透露法国的文件中，有一项是关于“政策互相依赖”的备忘录，它要求北大西洋集团各成员国的政策作“一定程度的配合”；另一项实质上是要求美国开放原子秘密。三个备忘录中没有一个提到在法国领土上设立美国导弹发射基地的问题。
    华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯10日在记者招待会上说，美国在即将举行的北大西洋公约组织最高级会议上的目的是为了应付北大西洋公约组织的“分离势力”，而“重振这个组织的精神”，“恢复人们认为北大西洋公约组织是必需的感觉”。他承认，美国是“正在试图进行一件很艰难的工作”。
    杜勒斯说，他希望这次会议将产生的“最重要的一个结果”将是北大西洋公约组织成员国“再度接受和重新致力于互相依赖的原则”。他说，美国已经为会议筹划了一整套重要决定。他承认将要“减损”盟国的主权。
    据美联社报道，华盛顿权威人士在11日说，美国正在研究如何使北大西洋联盟同里约热内卢条约组织（美洲国家组织）密切联系。
    使这两个集团加强联系是美国所策划的把西方一切军事集团捏在一起的庞大计划的一部分。美联社消息说，美国打算把这个计划提交即将开会的北大西洋集团政府首脑会议讨论。
