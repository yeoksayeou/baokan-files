    Russian Basketball Teams Both Victorious in Third Beijing Games
    The Russian Republic men's and women's basketball teams played their third friendly matches in Beijing on the evening of the 24th at the Beijing Gymnasium, against the "August 1st" Yellow Team and the Women's Second-Level League team, respectively. As a result, the visiting men's and women's teams won with scores of 70-59 and 52-49, respectively.
    
    The Visiting Women's Team's Victory Did Not Come Easily
    The league team, composed of the main players from the top three teams in this year's national women's basketball second-level league—Tianjin Team, Yunnan Team, and Hebei Province Team—with an average age of only eighteen, participated in an international competition for the first time. However, they demonstrated a strong attacking force and good dribbling and cutting moves during the game, making the entire match very tense. In the last two minutes, the league team was still leading by one point at 49-47, but lost due to lack of experience.
    
    The situation at the time was that the visiting team had possession of the ball, and when Yong Rong, number 12 of the league team, stepped forward to steal the ball, she accidentally committed a foul, allowing the visiting team's forward, Khargikova, to score two free throws, tying the score at 49-49. The atmosphere on the court became even more tense. After the league team called a timeout, forward Yong Rong carelessly committed another foul, and the opponent scored one of two free throws, taking the lead by one point. At this time, there was still one minute and eleven seconds left. The visiting team switched to controlling the ball, inducing the opponent to commit a foul while trying to steal the ball. This tactic was effective. The home team's guard, Li Shihua, was too eager to steal the ball and committed a foul, allowing the visiting team's Listman to score two free throws, ending the game with a three-point difference.
    
    At the beginning of the game, the league team used center Fu Bin, who is 1.815 meters tall, as the main attacking force under the basket. Outside, guards Li Shihua and forward Chen Xiushan, who were fast and good at cutting and dribbling, constantly passed the ball around to find opportunities to shoot and score. At the end of the first quarter, the league team led by three points with a score of 16-13.
    
    At the beginning of the second quarter, the visiting team, with its rich experience, immediately narrowed the defense area, with taller centers and forwards retreating to the basket to strengthen control under the basket, and two flexible and fast guards standing near the free throw line to defend. After winning the rebound when the opponent's shot was unsuccessful, they immediately launched a fast break counterattack. Oshepkova's three fast break scores allowed the visiting team to take the lead by three points. By the end of the second quarter, the visiting team was leading by 29-25.
    
    In the third quarter, the league team tied the score at 32-32, and finally ended the quarter with a score of 35-37, only losing by one point.
    
    In the fourth quarter, the visiting team used Labicheva and Khargikova as double centers, but they were closely watched by the league team's centers Fu Bin and Yong Rong and failed to score. On the contrary, the league team's center Fu Bin repeatedly grabbed rebounds and shot. In addition, Wu Xiangci, Chen Xiushan, and others were very active outside. In the last two minutes, they took the lead over the visiting team with a score of 49-47. In the end, they lost by a three-point difference simply because of lack of experience, as the visiting team scored five points through shots and free throws.
    
    The "August 1st" Yellow Team Lost Abnormally
    
    Unexpectedly, the "August 1st" Yellow Team performed abnormally in last night's men's match and lost by eleven points.
    
    At the beginning of the game, both sides launched fierce attacks. Under the visiting team's tight man-to-man defense in the zone, the "August 1st" Yellow Team did not make much progress in five minutes. Later, the "August 1st" Yellow Team switched to passing the ball around outside, looking for opportunities to cut in and cooperate with mid-range shots, which improved slightly. At this time, the visiting team's Zubkov and Kontieri moved back and forth under the basket, fiercely rebounding and shooting, scoring repeatedly. Kraev was flexible and alert, and scored twice with long-range shots. The visiting team maintained the lead. Then, Wei Fuqing, Pang Shihou, and Yu Wenzhong of the "August 1st" team scored with mid-range shots and cutting shots, recovering a lot of points. By the thirteenth minute, they had narrowed the gap to a tie at 16-16. At the fifteenth minute, the visiting team's main player, Zubkov, left the court due to a foot injury and was replaced by Bregman. However, the visiting team's offensive was not greatly affected. Kontieri and Bregman continued to score. Until the end of the first half, the visiting team was still leading by five points with a score of 30-25.
    
    In the second half, the "August 1st" Yellow Team could not launch fast breaks, could not cut in, and repeatedly missed mid-range shots, while also neglecting defense. Although the visiting team's Zubkov did not play, the rebounds were almost completely controlled by them. After they got the ball, Kontieri, Bregman, and Kraev quickly launched fast breaks, often creating situations of two-on-one or unguarded shots to score. With the home team's weak defense, the visiting team played with ease, and the score soared. By the end of the game, the score was 70-59, and the "August 1st" Yellow Team lost by eleven points. In the entire last twenty minutes, the "August 1st" Yellow Team's defense was chaotic. If several of the visiting team's main players had not left the court, the "August 1st" Yellow Team would have lost by an even greater margin.

    俄罗斯篮球队在京第三场比赛
    男队女队双双告捷
    本报讯　俄罗斯共和国男、女篮球队24日晚在北京体育馆内，同“八一”黄队和女子乙级联队女队举行了来北京后的第三场友谊比赛。比赛结果，客队男、女队分别以七十比五十九，五十二比四十九获胜。
    客队女队胜来不易
    由今年全国女子篮球乙级队联赛前三名，天津队、云南队、河北省队主力组成，队员平均年龄只有十八岁的联队，这次第一次参加国际比赛。但是她们在比赛中却表现了强有力的攻击力量和良好的过人、切入动作，以致使整场比赛进行得十分紧张，在最后二分钟时，联队还以四十九比四十七领先一球，只是由于经验不足才败北。
    当时的情况是客队掌握了球，联队十二号雍容上前抢球时，不慎撞人犯规，被客队前锋哈尔吉科娃两罚两中追成四十九平。场上气氛更为紧张，联队要求暂停后，前锋雍容不慎又犯规，对方两罚一中反超出一分。这时时间还有一分十一秒，客队改打控制球，诱使对方抢球犯规。这个战术果然收效，主队后卫李世华抢球心切，撞人犯规，被客队列斯曼两罚两中，以三分之差结束了这场比赛。
    比赛一开始，联队以身高一公尺八十一点五公分的中锋傅彬在篮下作为主要攻击力量，外围以快速而又善于切入、过人的后卫李世华、前锋陈秀山不断地倒手寻找机会，投篮得分。第一节结束时是十六比十三，联队领先三分。
    第二节一开始，富有比赛经验的客队立即缩小了防区，以身材较高的中锋、前锋退守篮下，加强篮下的控制，以两个灵活、快速的后卫站在罚球线附近防守，在对方投篮未中夺得篮板球后，马上快攻反击，奥舍普科娃的三次快攻得分，使客队反超出三分，到第二节结束时，客队反以二十九比二十五领先。
    第三节联队曾赶成三十二平，最后打成三十五比三十七，仅输一球。
    第四节中，客队以拉比切娃和哈尔吉科娃打双中锋，但被联队的中锋傅彬和雍容紧紧看住，未能建功。相反地联队的中锋傅彬多次地抢得了篮板球，进行投篮。加上外围邬湘慈、陈秀山等活跃非常，到最后二分钟时，反以四十九比四十七超出客队。最后只是由于经验不足，被客队连投带罚得了五分，才以三分之差败北。
    “八一”黄队失常败北
    昨晚的男子赛，出人意料之外，“八一”黄队表演失常，输了十一分。
    比赛一开始，双方展开猛攻，在客队区域人盯人的严密防守下，“八一”黄队五分钟内没有大的建树，后“八一”黄队改打外围传球，伺机切入并配合中距离投篮，才稍见起色。而在这时客队的祖布科夫和康捷里，在篮下左右穿插移动，猛摘猛投，连连得分。克拉耶夫灵活机警，二次远投中篮。客队一直领先。接着，“八一”队韦福庆庞世侯和俞文忠中距离投进和切入投中，扳回了不少分。到十三分钟时已追至十六平。打到十五分钟时，客队主力祖布科夫脚伤下场，由勃列格曼入替。但客队攻势没有受到大影响，康捷里和勃列格曼一再投中。直到上半时终了，客队仍以三十比二十五，领先五分。
    下半时，“八一”黄队快攻打不出来，切也切不进去，中距离投篮屡屡不中，同时又疏于防守。客队的祖布科夫虽然没有上场，但篮板球几乎完全控制在他们手里。他们得到球后，康捷里、勃列格曼和克拉耶夫迅即展开快攻，场上经常造成二打一或无人防守而得分的现象。在主队防守无力的情况下，客队得心应手，分数扶摇直上。到终场打成了七十比五十九，“八一”黄队输了十一分。在整个后二十分钟里，“八一”黄队的防守混乱，要不是客队的几个主力已下场，“八一”黄队将要输得更多。
