Special Dispatch by Our Newspaper and Xinhua News Agency: A new trend of cherishing labor is emerging among teachers and students in universities across the country. A large number of students and faculty are using holidays to go to the countryside to participate in physical labor.

Since the beginning of the new school year this year, universities across the country have strengthened labor education for students. Especially after the rectification campaign entered its third stage, the vast majority of teachers and students generally requested to participate in labor training, transform their thinking, and truly become working-class intellectuals. The enthusiasm of teachers and students for participating in physical labor has generally increased. According to statistics from the Communist Youth League of Shenyang, from the beginning of September to late November, ten universities in Shenyang have held twenty-five autumn harvests and city-wide voluntary labor activities, with a total of more than 46,500 student participants. In the past month or so, Nanjing Institute of Technology has organized students to participate in agricultural infrastructure construction, environmental sanitation and other labor activities twenty-four times, dispatching more than 13,000 students and completing more than 30,400 work hours. Teachers and students of Nanjing University also helped an agricultural cooperative repair a two-mile-long canal, which can drain and irrigate more than 1.3 million mu of land. Recently, more than 2,000 teachers and students from Huazhong Agricultural College and Central South Academy of Fine Arts went to the state-owned Donghu Farm in the suburbs of Wuhan to reclaim wasteland. Teachers and students from Northwest University, Northwest University of Technology, Xi'an Institute of Physical Education, Zhejiang University, Xiamen University, and Fujian Normal University have all gone to nearby agricultural cooperatives to participate in autumn harvesting, winter planting, or preparations for next spring's production. Among them, more than 3,800 faculty members and students from Fujian Normal University worked more than 4,800 workdays in ten agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Fuzhou. In addition to participating in agricultural cooperative labor production, students from Northeast Normal University also worked as salespersons or ticket sellers in department stores, tram companies, and bookstores, as well as sweeping roads and other work.

Many universities have established regular contact with agricultural cooperatives, and teachers and students regularly go to agricultural cooperatives to participate in labor. Teachers and students who go to the countryside to participate in labor generally actively produce, humbly learn from farmers, abide by labor discipline, and eat, live, and work with farmers. Students from Shandong Agricultural College, who participated in labor for a relatively long time, gradually overcame difficulties such as insufficient physical strength and unfamiliarity with life, and learned some basic agricultural operation techniques, and were enthusiastically called "new members" by the farmers. According to Shenyang universities, many students from bourgeois families realized the hard work of farmers described in "every grain on the plate comes from hard toil" only after participating in agricultural labor.

In the school building construction projects and campus renovation work of various universities, teachers and students also enthusiastically participated in labor. 90% of the students and teachers of Hubei Medical College participated in voluntary labor in the construction of the school. Students from Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering also learned to lay sewer pipes and build wind and rain playgrounds in the school building construction project. Students from Northwest Russian College also built two roads on campus. Students from Southwest Agricultural College also built a "Communist Youth League Garden" on a piece of wasteland covered with weeds.

Many light labor tasks in the lives of universities have begun to be undertaken by the students themselves. Ninety-one public classrooms in Nanjing Institute of Technology were originally cleaned by workers, but now all of them are cleaned by students in rotation. Students from Xi'an Medical College, Northeast Normal University, and Changchun Veterinary University have participated in cleaning school buildings and helping cooks prepare food. Four thousand students from Chongqing University also reclaimed sixteen mu of wasteland on campus into a vegetable garden, and students from Northeast Institute of Technology also dug three vegetable cellars on campus and transported 700,000 jin of Chinese cabbage.

Now, the participation of faculty and students in physical labor in universities is gradually forming a regular system. Shenyang Normal College, Shenyang Agricultural College and other four schools have established voluntary labor committees, which arrange labor content according to different seasons, stipulating that each person participates in labor for six to eight hours per month. Zhejiang Agricultural College stipulates that each faculty member participates in labor for eight to sixteen hours per month, and students participate in physical labor in combination with teaching plans through agricultural operations, teaching internships, production internships, and usual voluntary labor.

    各地高等学校开始出现新风气
    放下知识分子架子　积极参加劳动锻炼
    本报特约新华社专稿　各地高等学校师生中开始出现热爱劳动的新风气，大批学生和教职员利用假日下乡参加体力劳动。
    今年新学年开学以来，各地高等学校都加强了对学生的劳动教育，特别是在整风运动进入第三阶段以后，广大师生普遍要求参加劳动锻炼，改造思想，使自己真正成为工人阶级知识分子，师生们参加体力劳动的热情普遍高涨。据共青团沈阳市委员会的统计，从9月初到11月下旬，沈阳十所高等学校已举行二十五次秋收和全市性的义务劳动，参加劳动的学生共达四万六千五百多人次。南京工学院最近一个多月来组织学生参加农业基本建设、环境卫生等劳动二十四次，出动学生一万三千多人次，做了三万零四百多个工时。南京大学的教师和学生也帮助一个农业社包修了一条二里长的水渠，可以排涝灌溉一百三十多万亩地。华中农学院和中南美术专科学校最近有两千多教师和学生到武汉市郊区国营东湖农场垦荒。西北大学、西北工业大学、西安体育学院、浙江大学、厦门大学和福建师范学院等校师生，都到附近农业社参加秋收、冬种或明春生产的准备工作。其中福建师范学院教职员和学生三千八百多人在福州郊区十个农业社做了四千八百多个工作日。东北师范大学学生除参加农业社劳动生产外，还到百货公司、电车公司、书店等当售货员或售票员，以及打扫马路等工作。
    许多高等学校同农业社建立了经常的联系，师生们定期到农业社参加劳动。下乡参加劳动的教师和学生一般都能积极生产，虚心向农民学习，遵守劳动纪律，同农民同吃同住同干活。参加劳动时间比较长的山东农学院学生，逐步克服了体力不够和生活不习惯等困难，学会了一些基本的农业操作技术，被农民热情地称呼为“新社员”。据沈阳高等学校反映：许多资产阶级家庭出身的学生，参加农业劳动以后，才体会到“谁知盘中餐，粒粒皆辛苦”所描写的农民的辛勤劳动。
    在各地高等学校校舍建筑工程和校园整理工作中，师生们也热情地参加了劳动。湖北医学院有90％的学生和教师参加了建校的义务劳动，西安建筑工程学院的学生在校舍建筑工程中，还学着铺设下水道管子和修建风雨操场，西北俄文专科学校学生也在校园内修了两条马路。西南农学院学生还在一片长满野草的荒地上建成了一座“共青团花园”。
    高等学校许多生活方面的轻便劳动，已经开始由学生自己担负起来。南京工学院九十一个公共教室原来都由工人打扫，现在全部由学生轮流打扫，西安医学院、东北师范大学和长春兽医大学等校学生都参加了打扫校舍和帮助厨师做菜做饭等活动。重庆大学学生四千人，还把校内十六亩荒地开垦成为一个菜园，东北工学院学生也在校内挖了三个菜窖，搬运了七十万斤白菜。
    现在，高等学校教职员和学生参加体力劳动正逐渐形成经常的制度。沈阳师范学院、沈阳农学院等四校已经成立义务劳动委员会，根据季节不同安排劳动内容，规定每人每月参加劳动六到八小时。浙江农学院规定教职员每人每月参加劳动八到十六小时，学生结合教学计划通过农事操作、教学实习、生产实习和平时参加义务劳动等方式，参加体力劳动。
