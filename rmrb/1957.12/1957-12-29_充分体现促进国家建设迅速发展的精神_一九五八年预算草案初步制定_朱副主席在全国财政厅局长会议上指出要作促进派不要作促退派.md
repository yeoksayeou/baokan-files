Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The National Conference of Finance Bureau Chiefs, with the central task of discussing and arranging the 1958 national financial budget, concluded on the 27th after sixteen days. The conference, based on the central government's established principle of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously with priority given to the development of heavy industry, and the principle of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, as well as the task of catching up with or surpassing the United Kingdom in the output of steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years, has preliminarily formulated the draft of the 1958 national budget. This budget draft will be submitted to the State Council for review and approval before being submitted to the National People's Congress for discussion and adoption.

Vice Chairman Zhu De attended the meeting and gave important instructions. Vice Premier Li Xiannian delivered reports at both the beginning and the end of the meeting.

During the discussion and arrangement of the 1958 budget, the conference, based on the draft of the 1958 national economic plan, noted the significant growth in the level of industrial and agricultural production and the active efforts of governments and financial departments at all levels to increase income by every possible means, resulting in a substantial increase in the 1958 budget revenue compared to the targets set at the National Conference of Finance Bureau Chiefs in September of this year. In terms of expenditure, the principle of building the country diligently and frugally was implemented, vigorously reducing non-productive expenditures, especially cutting unnecessary operating expenses or lowering the standards of operating expenses, and expanding the productive basic construction investment in 1958 with the funds saved. Therefore, the 1958 budget draft embodies the spirit of promoting the rapid development of socialist construction.

The conference also studied the possible problems arising after the implementation of the new financial system and further studied some specific measures for further implementing the new financial system.

This conference also implemented the spirit of rectification. Responsible persons from the financial departments of various provinces and cities held airing-out meetings, and some even posted big-character posters, putting forward many criticisms and suggestions on the leadership work and style of the Ministry of Finance.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th: On December 25th, Vice Chairman Zhu De delivered an important speech to more than 1,000 financial workers attending the National Conference of Finance Bureau Chiefs, the National Conference of Tax Bureau Chiefs, and the Branch Presidents' Conference of the People's Bank of China. He called on the comrades in the financial departments and banks to do a good job in mobilizing and allocating funds to accelerate the country's construction.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said that our general task in the future will be to strive to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science within ten to fifteen years, and to strive to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in the output of steel and other important industrial products in about fifteen years. In this heroic and ambitious undertaking, the financial departments and banks shoulder a great task. The more effective the organization and completion of the work of the financial and banking sectors, the more and more rationally funds can be raised and allocated, and the more rapidly the socialist cause can be promoted. In socialist construction, financial departments and banks should become promoters, not deterrents. The financial departments and banks should actively support the increase of construction projects that can be achieved through efforts, and should mobilize and concentrate all the funds that can be raised to ensure the needs of socialist construction.

Vice Chairman Zhu De then spoke separately on the two aspects of increasing revenue and saving expenditure. He said that the main way to increase revenue is to rely on the development of industrial and agricultural production and the expansion of commodity exchanges to open up sources of income. As Chairman Mao pointed out, only by developing the economy can we ensure supply. Only by arranging as much basic construction investment as possible can we ensure continuous expansion of reproduction and ensure increased income. In order to increase income, we must also rely on the accumulation within socialist enterprises. We should earnestly strengthen the financial management of enterprises, strive to improve labor productivity, save raw materials and management expenses, reduce production costs, and accelerate capital turnover to increase internally accumulated funds. After affirming the achievements of the financial departments and banks, Vice Chairman Zhu criticized some financial and banking staff members for not actively exploring sources of income and for only paying attention to large amounts of major income and neglecting small amounts of minor income. For example, the financial departments now only pay attention to the funds within the budget, not to the funds outside the budget; the banking system only pays attention to the part of the funds that absorbs deposits and issues loans, and does not pay attention to the circulating funds of the entire society. Some cadres simply rely on the development of production to increase income and do not pay attention to increasing income from strengthening financial management. Therefore, Vice Chairman Zhu De requested financial and banking cadres to strengthen the overall perspective in their work and to actively do more work in raising funds, trying every possible means to accumulate construction funds for the country.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said: In terms of expenditure, we must adhere to the principle of spending less money and doing more things, and developing socialist construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. He said: We must drastically reduce non-productive expenditures and increase the proportion of economic undertakings expenditure and basic construction expenditure; in basic construction, we must also engage in more productive basic construction and less non-productive basic construction. In the past two years, great achievements have been made in reducing military and administrative expenses, but there is still the possibility and necessity to continue to reduce them. The savings of various operating expenses are still far from sufficient. The phenomena of large operating institutions, too many personnel, and low work efficiency exist everywhere. We must practice strict economy in operating expenses.

Vice Chairman Zhu De talked about the experience of planned expansion of the scale of construction in 1956 and planned contraction in 1957. He emphatically refuted the doubts about the principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical." He pointed out that the development of construction must be based on actual possibilities and must be fully active. It is absolutely impossible to only want "steady" and not "active," to only want to live a comfortable life, and to be afraid of tense struggles. In this way, the construction cause will not be able to advance rapidly. It must be pointed out that neither the financial side nor the financial side will be easy in the next ten to fifteen years, and we must prepare for a long period of tension and even hardship. We must adhere to the principle of building the country diligently and frugally, developing socialist construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Vice Chairman Zhu De then gave important instructions on bank credit and savings work. He pointed out that the main task of the bank at present is to serve the high tide of industrial and agricultural production by doing a good job in financial work. Taking supporting agricultural production as an example, issuing agricultural loans, supporting industrial departments to produce chemical fertilizers, machinery, and small farm tools needed by agriculture, and supporting commercial departments to purchase agricultural products, and supplying farmers with means of production and means of livelihood are all direct and indirect support for agriculture; the bank must do these things well. With the development of agricultural production, the financial potential of farmers is gradually increasing. This year's rural deposits have increased by 1 billion yuan compared with last year, which is a large number. The bank should continue to pay attention to mobilizing the farmers' own funds, "gathering fur into robes," and building the countryside. In addition, the bank's credit department should also help agricultural cooperatives to do a good job in accounting, improve financial management, help them to uniformly and rationally arrange the use of funds, and oppose waste. Vice Chairman Zhu De emphasized that the bank's support for the high tide of agricultural production is not just about giving money; some money must be given, but the most important thing is to find ways to tap the rural financial potential and implement the principle of running the cooperatives diligently and frugally, and doing more things with less money. In this way, the farmers' own strength can be combined with the state's assistance to promote the leap forward in agricultural production.

Doing a good job in savings business is one of the most important means of mobilizing the funds of the urban and rural people to promote the country's construction. At present, the total number of urban savings deposits in banks has reached more than 2.7 billion yuan, and has increased by more than 500 million yuan every year in the past two years, which is a considerable amount of financial power. However, the development of savings undertakings in various places is still very uneven, the savings work in small and medium-sized cities is not carried out enough, and the publicity of thrift and savings is not in-depth. In the future, savings work should be carried out universally in large, medium, and small cities, the savings potential of the masses of all social strata should be studied, and the masses should be mobilized to deposit the remaining money in the bank, so that not only can they save money for future use, but also accumulate construction funds for the country, and at the same time cultivate the social atmosphere of hard work and thrift, and building the country diligently and frugally. Rural deposits also have great development prospects. In the future, special attention should be paid to the development of personal deposits. If the number of rural deposit accounts can be increased from the current 10% to 30% of the total number of rural households to 30% to 50%, the deposits will increase greatly. To absorb farmers' deposits, we must strive to run credit cooperatives well, and pay special attention to implementing the principles of "voluntary deposit, free withdrawal, and convenience for the masses."

Vice Chairman Zhu De finally talked about improving the financial system. He said that the new financial system is a good method. Its greatest advantage is that under the premise of ensuring unified leadership and key construction, it appropriately expands the financial management authority of local governments, so that local governments can actively arrange their own revenues and expenditures; it appropriately increases the local government's flexible financial resources, so that local governments can solve the needs of special local expenditures, thereby further giving play to the local government's enthusiasm for accumulating funds, increasing income, and saving expenditure, and promoting the development of construction undertakings.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said that after the implementation of the new system, the local governments' power has increased and the responsibility has also increased. Within the scope of their own income, local governments should work hard to increase income and also rationally allocate and use it. In the use of funds, both the central and local governments should focus on the development of industrial and agricultural production. After the implementation of the new system, local governments should pay special attention to taking care of the overall situation more than ever before. Only in this way will it be conducive to the development of construction undertakings. After the implementation of the new financial system, local governments should not only manage local enterprises and undertakings well, but also manage the central department-managed enterprises and undertakings in the local area well.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said that the central departments must strengthen the work of comprehensive balance and strengthen the guidance of policies and guidelines to the relevant departments of local governments. This work can be carried out in three aspects: (1) Through the formulation of the national economic plan (long-term plan and annual plan) and the national budget, to examine whether the arrangement of various construction undertakings in the local area is appropriate, and to adjust inappropriate ones through comprehensive balance. (2) The relevant central departments should strengthen the guidance of policies and guidelines for the undertakings in charge of their departments, and help the local construction undertakings develop along the correct path. (3) The unified systems and staffing quotas that must be unified nationwide should be formulated by the central government, and the relevant central departments can strengthen the guidance of local work by formulating these standards and systems.

Vice Chairman Zhu De finally said that the current new system mainly solves the problems between the central government and the provinces and cities; the provinces and cities should study and solve the system problems between the provinces and counties and cities, appropriately arrange the powers and responsibilities of county and city finances and enterprise finances, comprehensively implement the spirit of the new financial system, and give full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of local governments at all levels.

    充分体现促进国家建设迅速发展的精神
    一九五八年预算草案初步制定
    朱副主席在全国财政厅局长会议上指出要作促进派不要作促退派
    新华社28日讯　以讨论和安排1958年国家财政预算为中心任务的全国财政厅局长会议27日结束。这次会议共开了十六天。会议根据中央确定的在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工农业同时并举的方针和又多又快又好又省地建设社会主义的方针，以及争取十五年后在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的任务，初步制定了1958年国家预算草案，这个预算草案将提请国务院审查批准后再提交全国人民代表大会讨论通过。
    朱德副主席到会作了重要指示。李先念副总理在会议开始和结束时都作了报告。
    会议在讨论和安排1958年预算时，根据1958年国民经济计划草案，工农业生产水平都有不少增长的情况和各级政府、财政部门千方百计地积极增加收入，使1958年预算收入比今年9月全国财政厅局长会议拟定的指标有不少的增长；在支出方面贯彻了勤俭建国的方针，大力缩减了非生产性开支，特别是削减了不必要的事业费或降低了事业费的标准，把节省下来的资金，扩大了1958年生产性的基本建设投资，因此1958年预算草案体现了促进社会主义建设事业迅速发展的精神。
    会议还研究了实行新的财政体制后可能发生的问题，并研究了进一步贯彻执行新的财政体制的一些具体措施。
    这次会议还贯彻了整风精神，各省市财政部门负责人举行了鸣放会，有的还贴了大字报，对财政部的领导工作和作风提出了不少批评和建议。
    新华社28日讯　朱德副主席在12月25日向出席全国财政厅局长会议、全国税务局长会议和人民银行分行行长会议的一千多名财政金融工作干部作了重要讲话，他号召财政部门和银行的工作同志，做好动员和分配资金的工作，来加速国家的建设。
    朱德副主席说，我们今后总的任务是争取在十年到十五年内把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国，并且争取在十五年左右的时间内，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国。在这个英勇豪迈的事业中，财政部门和银行担负着很大的任务。财政、银行部门的工作组织和完成得愈有成效，就愈能更多、更合理地筹集资金和分配资金，促进社会主义事业的迅速前进。在社会主义建设中，财政部门和银行要成为促进派，不要成为促退派，凡是经过努力就可做到的建设项目的增加，财政部门和银行都应当积极支持，应当把一切可以筹集的资金都调动和集中起来，以便保证社会主义建设的需要。
    朱德副主席接着分别谈到增加收入和节约支出两个方面的问题。他说，增加收入的主要途径就是依靠工农业生产的发展和商品交流的扩大，来开辟财源。正如毛主席所指示的：只有发展经济，才能保障供给。只有尽可能地多安排一些基本建设投资，才能保证不断地扩大再生产，才能保证增加收入。为了增加收入，还要依靠社会主义企业内部的积累。应当切实加强企业财务的管理工作，努力提高劳动生产率，节约原材料和管理费用，降低生产成本，加速资金周转，以增加内部积累的资金。朱副主席在肯定了财政部门和银行部门的成绩后，接着对财政部门和银行有些工作人员不主动开辟财源和只重视大量的主要的收入而忽视小量的次要的收入等错误，提出了批评。如财政部门现在只注意管预算内的资金，不注意管预算外的资金；银行系统只注意吸收存款发放贷款的这部分资金，而不注意整个社会的流通资金。有的干部单纯依靠生产的发展来增加收入而不注意从加强财务管理工作中来增加收入。因此朱副主席要求财政银行干部在业务上要加强全面观点，在筹集资金方面应当主动地多做些工作，千方百计地为国家积累建设资金。
    朱副主席说：在支出方面，必须坚持少花钱、多办事，又多又快又好又省地发展社会主义建设事业的勤俭建国的方针。他说：必须狠狠地降低非生产性的支出，提高经济事业支出和基本建设支出的比重；在基本建设中，也必须多搞生产性的基本建设，少搞非生产性的基本建设。近两年来，节减军政费用获得了很大成绩，但是还有可能而且应当继续进行节减。各种事业费用的节约，作得还很不够，事业机构庞大、人员过多，工作效率低等等现象，到处都有。必须在事业费方面厉行节约。
    朱副主席谈到了1956年有计划扩大建设规模和1957年有计划收缩的经验，他着重地驳斥了对于“多、快、好、省”方针的怀疑。他指出：发展建设事业，必须根据实际的可能，又必须充分积极。只要“稳妥”，不要“积极”，只想过轻松日子，害怕紧张的斗争，是绝对不行的。这样建设事业就将不可能迅速前进。必须指出，不论是财政方面或者金融方面，在今后十年到十五年内，都决不会怎么轻松的，我们必须准备过长期的紧张的甚至艰苦的日子。我们必须坚持又多又好又快又省地发展社会主义建设的勤俭建国方针。
    朱副主席接着对银行信贷和储蓄工作，作了重要的指示。他指出，目前银行的主要任务，就是通过做好金融工作，来为工农业生产高潮服务。拿支持农业生产来说，发放农贷，支持工业部门生产农业所需要的化学肥料、机械、小农具，支持商业部门收购农产品，对农民供应生产资料和生活资料，都是对农业的直接和间接的支持；银行要把这些都做好。随着农业生产的发展，农民的资金潜力也渐渐大起来了。今年的农村存款比去年增加十亿元，这是很大的数字。银行应当继续注意把农民自己的资金发动起来，“集腋成裘”，建设农村。此外银行信用部门还要帮助农业社搞好会计工作，健全财务管理，帮助他们统一地、合理地安排资金使用，反对浪费。朱副主席强调说，银行支持农业生产高潮，不光是拿钱；钱是要拿一些，最重要的是设法挖掘农村的资金潜力和贯彻勤俭办社的方针，用更少的钱办更多的事。这样，就能使农民自己的力量结合国家的帮助，推动农业生产的跃进。
    办好储蓄业务，是动员城乡人民群众的资金来推进国家建设事业的最重要的手段之一。现在银行的城镇储蓄存款总数已经达到二十七亿多元，最近两年每年增加五亿多元，这是一笔可观的资金力量。但是目前各地储蓄事业的发展还很不平衡，中小城镇的储蓄工作还开展得不够，勤俭持家和节约储蓄的宣传做得不深入。今后要在大、中、小城市普遍开展储蓄工作，要研究社会各阶层群众的储蓄潜力，动员群众把剩余的钱都存入银行，这样，不但可以做到储钱备用，而且又为国家积聚了建设资金，同时也培养了艰苦朴素、勤俭建国的社会风气。农村存款也有很大的发展前途，今后要特别注意发展个人存款，如能把农村存款户由现在占农户总数的10％到30％增加到30％到50％，存款就会大大增加。要吸收农民存款，必须努力把信用合作社办好，特别要注意贯彻执行“存款自愿，取款自由，便利群众”的原则。
    朱副主席最后谈到改进财政体制问题。他说，新的财政体制是一个好办法，它的最大好处是在保证统一领导和重点建设的条件下，适当地扩大了地方的财政管理职权，使地方能够主动地安排自己的收支；适当地增加了地方的机动财力，使地方能够解决当地特殊支出的需要，从而将进一步发挥地方积累资金、增加收入、节约支出的积极性，推动建设事业的发展。
    朱副主席说，实行新体制以后，地方的权力大了，责任也加重了，地方在自己的收入范围内，应当努力工作，增加收入，同时也要合理地分配使用。在使用资金中，不论中央和地方都要以发展工农业生产作为重点。实行新体制以后，地方还应当比任何时候都要特别注意照顾全局。只有这样，才有利于建设事业的发展。实行新财政体制以后，地方不仅要把地方的企业和事业管好，还应当把在地方上的中央部管企业、事业管好。
    朱副主席说，中央各部门必须加强综合平衡工作，加强对地方有关部门的政策方针的指导。这一工作可以从三方面进行：（一）通过国民经济计划（长期计划和年度计划）和国家预算的编制，来审查地方各项建设事业的安排是否妥当，发现不妥的经过综合平衡加以调整。（二）中央各有关部门应加强对本部门主管事业的政策方针的指导，帮助地方建设事业沿着正确的道路向前发展。（三）全国范围内必须统一的制度和定员定额标准等，要由中央来制定，中央有关部门可以通过制定这些标准、制度来加强对地方工作的指导。
    朱副主席最后说，目前的新体制主要是解决中央和省、市之间的问题；各省市应当研究解决省和县市之间的体制问题，适当地安排县市财政和企业财务的职权，全面地把新的财政体制的精神贯彻下去，使各级地方的积极性和主动性，充分地发挥出来。
