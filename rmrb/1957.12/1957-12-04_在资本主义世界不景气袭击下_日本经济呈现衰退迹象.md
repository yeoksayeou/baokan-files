Xinhua News Agency Report: The Japanese economy, which was once in a state of "boom," has shown signs of recession.

The economic austerity policies adopted by the Japanese government to change the huge trade deficit and the "overproduction" caused by the blind expansion of production by the Japanese industry under the stimulation of "prosperity" are important factors that forced Japanese production to decline starting in June. At the same time, the economic downturn in the entire capitalist world, especially the impact of the economic recession in the United States, has deepened the difficulties in Japan's exports and the deterioration of its international balance of payments.

According to the "Trends of Mining and Manufacturing Industries" report for the first half of this year (April to September) recently released by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Japan's mining and manufacturing production reached its peak in May this year and then began to gradually decline. The level of mining and manufacturing production in September decreased by 4.3% compared to May. The Economic Planning Agency said in its economic monthly report in September: "It is worth noting that the production of metals, textiles, machinery, chemicals and other industries has declined simultaneously, and the production reduction is spreading to a wider range of production sectors." The textile industry is in a serious crisis of overproduction, and even in November, which is usually a peak month, many companies are still declaring bankruptcy. According to Kyodo News, citing materials released by the Tokyo Credit Exchange, forty-nine textile manufacturers in Japan declared bankruptcy in November, each owing more than 10 million yen.

The industrial and mining production index in Japan for the first half of this year was 293.9 (1950 as 100), an increase of 8.9% compared with the second half of last year and an increase of 18.7% compared with the first half of last year. It is estimated that the average production level in the second half of this year will decrease by 11.4% compared to the first half of the year.

At the same time, unsalable goods in factories and stores are constantly increasing. According to a survey report by the Ministry of Finance on 195 companies in various industries, the total inventory of these companies from July to September reached 965.3 billion yen, an increase of 5.6% compared with the previous three months and an increase of 49.5% compared with the same period last year. Under such circumstances, the income of these enterprises during this period decreased to 34.9 billion yen, a decrease of 45.6% compared with the previous three months and a decrease of 8.2% compared with the same period last year.

The increase in inventory has caused the prices of textiles, steel and other commodities to fall repeatedly. Among them, the price of steel, a representative commodity of means of production, fell by 29.3% from October last year to August this year. Therefore, the textile industry, chemical fiber industry, and steel industry have had to repeatedly cut production in an attempt to maintain their commodity prices.

It is especially worth noting that the prospects for the two major factors that stimulated Japan's economic "boom"—increased equipment investment and increased exports—are not optimistic.

"Japan News Weekly" reported not long ago that due to the intensification of the dollar shortage in the capitalist world, the United States, Britain, and Canada have launched a movement to boycott Japanese goods, and the international balance of payments of Southeast Asian countries has deteriorated. Japan's exports have clearly shown a state of stagnation. The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry also had to admit that it would be difficult for Japan's exports to reach the Japanese government's original target of 3.15 billion US dollars next year. Therefore, Japan's international balance of payments next year is unlikely to reach the government's original target of a surplus of 200 million US dollars.

Domestic equipment investment is also decreasing. The main indicator reflecting equipment investment—private industrial machinery orders—has declined sharply after reaching its peak in February this year. By August, the amount of machinery orders had decreased from 26.7 billion yen in February to 9.7 billion yen. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry also believes that equipment investment will decrease by about 10% next year.

"Japan News Weekly" pointed out: "Judging from the current situation of the international balance of payments and the tightness of the financial market, there is no room for Japan's economy to expand again and investment activities to expand again." The magazine also said: As the equipment investment that has already been made is gradually completed, the contradiction between production and consumption will further deepen, and "Japan's economic boom will inevitably fall into a full-scale recession."

### 在资本主义世界不景气袭击下　日本经济呈现衰退迹象

　　在资本主义世界不景气袭击下
　　日本经济呈现衰退迹象
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：曾经一度处于“景气”状态的日本经济已经表现出衰退的迹象。
    日本政府为了改变对外贸易的巨额入超所采取的经济紧缩政策和日本产业界在“繁荣”的刺激下盲目扩大生产所造成的“生产过剩”，是迫使日本生产从6月开始下降的重要因素。同时更由于整个资本主义世界经济不景气，特别是美国经济衰退的影响，加深了日本出口的困难和国际收支的恶化。
    据日本通商产业省最近发表的今年度上半年（4月到9月）的“工矿业动向”报告中说，日本的工矿业生产到今年5月达到顶点以后开始逐渐下降。9月份的工矿业生产水平比5月份下降了4.3％。经济企划厅在9月份的经济月报中说：“值得注意的是，金属、纺织、机械、化学等产业的生产都一齐下降，并且减产的情况正在波及更加广泛的生产部门”。纺织业更是处于严重的生产过剩危机，即使在常年是旺月的11月份中，仍然纷纷宣告破产。据共同社引用东京信用交换所公布的材料报道，日本在11月份又有四十九家纺织厂商宣告破产，每家欠债都在一千万日元以上。
    今年度上半年日本工矿业生产指数是二九三·九（1950年为一○○），比去年度下半年增加了8.9％，比去年度上半年增加了18.7％。据估计，今年度下半年的平均生产水平将比上半年下降11.4％。
    与此同时，工厂和商店的滞销货物不断地增加。据大藏省对各种行业的一百九十五个公司的调查报告，在从7月至9月的三个月中，这些公司的存货额共达九千六百五十三亿日元，比前三个月增加了5.6％，比去年同期增加了49.5％。在这种情况下，这些企业的收入在这一时期下降为三百四十九亿日元，比前三个月减少了45.6％比去年同期减少8.2％。
    存货的增多使得纺织品、钢铁等商品的价格一再下跌。其中，生产资料的代表性商品——钢铁的价格从去年10月到今年8月下降了29.3％。因此，纺织业、化学纤维业和钢铁业不得不一再削减生产，企图维持它们的商品价格。
    尤其值得注意的是，过去刺激日本经济“景气”的两大因素——设备投资的增加和出口的增加，前景并不乐观。
    “日本新闻周刊”在不久前报道说，由于资本主义世界的美元不足正在严重化，美国、英国和加拿大展开了抵制日本货物的运动，东南亚各国国际收支恶化等原因，日本的出口已经明显地表现出停滞的状态。日本通商产业省也不得不承认，明年度日本的出口很难达到日本政府原订的三十一亿五千万美元的目标。因此，明年度日本的国际收支也不可能达到政府原订的盈余二亿美元的目标。
    国内的设备投资也在不断减少。反映设备投资的主要指标——私营工业的机械订货量，从今年2月达到顶点后直线下降。到8月，机械订货额已经从2月的二百六十七亿日元减少为九十七亿日元。通商产业省并且认为，设备投资在明年度将减少10％左右。
    “日本新闻周刊”指出：“从国际收支的现状和金融市场的紧张程度来看，日本经济再次扩大，投资活动再次扩大的余地是没有的”。这家杂志还说：随着已经投下的设备投资的逐步完成，生产与消费之间的矛盾将进一步加深，“日本的经济景气将不可避免地会全面衰退”。
