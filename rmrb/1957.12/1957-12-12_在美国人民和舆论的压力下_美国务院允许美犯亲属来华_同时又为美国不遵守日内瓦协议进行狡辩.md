    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 11th: The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 6th, announcing that it would allow the direct relatives of Americans who were convicted and imprisoned by the Chinese government for violating the law in China to visit relatives in China.

    As early as January 1955, the Chinese side, out of humanitarian considerations, expressed its agreement to allow the relatives of American prisoners to come to China to visit relatives. However, for more than two years, the U.S. government has been prohibiting these relatives of American prisoners from coming to China. This measure previously implemented by the U.S. government has been met with strong dissatisfaction from the prisoners' families and criticism from the American public opinion. News reports indicate that after the State Department's statement was issued, some family members of American prisoners are already preparing to come to China. At the same time, the State Department emphasized in its statement that this measure does not mean that the U.S. government's basic policy towards China has changed. The statement said that the U.S. government's current general policy remains not to issue passports for travel to China.

    The State Department also maliciously slandered China in its statement for not complying with the agreement reached in the Sino-U.S. talks in Geneva on the issue of the return of civilians, saying that China "is still detaining six American citizens in prison." This statement by the United States is a distortion of the facts. The Chinese government has always abided by the above-mentioned agreement, and Americans in China have never been hindered from returning to their country. As for the Americans in Chinese prisons, they are all Americans who have violated the law in China, and the Chinese government has every right to detain them according to their crimes. Even those American prisoners who are imprisoned in China, due to the lenient measures taken by the Chinese side according to law, the original number of forty has now been reduced to only six. However, the U.S. side is still obstructing thousands of Chinese people from returning to their motherland.

    Who is violating the Geneva agreement on the repatriation of civilians on both sides? The facts show that it is the United States itself.

    在美国人民和舆论的压力下
    美国务院允许美犯亲属来华
    同时又为美国不遵守日内瓦协议进行狡辩
    据新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院6日发表声明，宣布允许由于在中国犯法而被中国政府判刑监禁的美国人的直系亲属来中国探亲。
    早在1955年1月，中国方面就出于人道考虑，表示同意让美国犯人的亲属来华探亲。但是两年多来，美国政府一直禁止这些美国犯人的亲属来中国。美国政府过去执行的这种措施受到了犯人家属们的强烈不满，也受到了美国舆论的指责。有消息说，在国务院这项声明发表后，有些美犯家属已在准备来中国。同时，国务院在它的声明中强调表明，这个措施并不意味美国政府对中国的基本政策有所改变，声明说，美国政府目前总的政策仍然是不发去中国旅行的护照。
    国务院还在它的声明中恶意诬蔑中国不遵守日内瓦中美会谈中就双方平民回国问题达成的协议，“仍然在监狱中拘留六名美国公民”。美国这种说法是颠倒黑白。中国政府一贯遵守上述协议，在中国的美国人回国从未受到阻挠。至于在中国监狱里的都是在中国犯法的美国人，中国政府完全有权根据他们的罪行予以拘禁。即便是那些在中国被监禁的美国犯人，由于中国方面依法对他们采取了宽大措施，原来有四十人的，现在已只剩下六人。但是美国方面却至今仍在阻挠上千的中国人回到他们的祖国。
    谁在违反关于双方平民返国的日内瓦协议？事实表明，正是美国自己。
