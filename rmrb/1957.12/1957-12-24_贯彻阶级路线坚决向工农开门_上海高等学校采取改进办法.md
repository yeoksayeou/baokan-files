Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 23rd. Shanghai's higher education authorities and various universities have focused on studying how to better implement the class line and resolutely open the door to workers and peasants in the current rectification movement, in the cause of cultivating talent for national construction.

Since 1953, the proportion of worker and peasant students in Shanghai universities has gradually increased. However, to date, it is estimated that students who are themselves of worker or peasant origin, or who come from worker and peasant families, only account for about 20%-30% of the total student population in various universities. According to a recent key investigation conducted by the Student Affairs Department of the Shanghai Higher Education Bureau on 6,881 students from seven universities, including Fudan University, Tongji University, and East China University of Political Science and Law, there are more worker and peasant students in social science majors, but fewer in natural sciences. The fewest worker and peasant students are in medical studies, followed by science. This shows that in the past few years, the work of expanding the source of worker and peasant students and planned admission of worker and peasant students has not been done well enough.

The Higher Education Bureau and various universities also held separate forums with worker and peasant students currently enrolled, to gain a deeper understanding of their learning, thinking, health conditions, and difficulties. Worker and peasant students are generally older and have a weaker cultural foundation. They are slower at reading reference books and doing homework, and they face many learning difficulties at the beginning. However, most of them have a good attitude towards learning, getting up early and going to bed late, studying diligently, and not even relaxing their studies on holidays. Although their studies are demanding, they are all able to actively undertake social work and participate in political activities. Some worker and peasant students, although their foundations are very weak, have made rapid progress, not only quickly catching up to the general level, but also achieving excellent results. The four fourth-year classes at Shanghai Second Medical College with the most worker and peasant students have become the best classes in the school in terms of academic performance and study style in recent years.

The inspection found that various universities have done some work in caring for and cultivating worker and peasant students. For example, some schools have created separate classes for them in majors with a higher proportion of worker and peasant students, and selected teachers with better lecturing skills to teach them, and so on. But in general, not enough attention has been paid.

Many universities have, in conjunction with the rectification and inspection, criticized the erroneous ideas of standing idly by in the face of worker and peasant students' learning difficulties, simply blaming them, and even despising them. At the same time, they have adopted improvement measures, allowing worker and peasant students with learning difficulties to be exempt from or postpone some minor courses, so that they can reduce their burden and concentrate on learning the major courses well. They have also created separate classes for them in some courses, such as foreign languages, to slow down the pace. They have assigned class learning guidance teachers to provide them with individual tutoring. They have reduced their social work, relaxed the standards for worker and peasant students to be expelled or held back due to poor academic performance, and relaxed temporary subsidy standards, etc. The Department of Chemistry at Fudan University invited experienced professors and lecturers to provide special tutoring in mathematics and chemistry for worker and peasant students.

While strengthening the cultivation of worker and peasant students already enrolled, various schools have put forward specific requirements to expand the source of worker and peasant students and gradually increase the proportion of worker and peasant students. The East China Institute of Textile Technology has decided to strive to achieve a worker and peasant component of one-third in the new students admitted in the next few years.

### 贯彻阶级路线坚决向工农开门  上海高等学校采取改进办法

    贯彻阶级路线坚决向工农开门
    上海高等学校采取改进办法
    据新华社上海23日电　上海高等教育主管部门和各高等学校在最近的整改运动中着重研究了当前培养国家建设人材事业中如何更好地贯彻阶级路线、坚决向工农开门的问题。
    1953年以来，上海各高等学校学生中工农学生的比重逐渐增加。但到目前为止，各高等学校在校学生中本人成分是工农和工农家庭出身的，据估计还只占学生总数的20％—30％左右。根据上海市高等教育管理局学生处最近对复旦大学、同济大学、华东政法学院等七所高等学校六千八百八十一名学生所作的重点调查，社会科学各专业工农学生较多，自然科学方面则较少。医科学生中工农学生最少，理科次之。这说明过去几年对扩大工农学生来源和有计划地吸收工农学生的工作，还作得很不够。
    高教局和各校还分别召集了在校的工农学生座谈，比较深入地了解了他们的学习、思想、健康情况和困难。工农学生一般年龄较大，文化基础较差，看参考书和做作业都较慢，开始时学习上的困难很多。但他们大都学习态度好，平时早起晚睡，刻苦钻研，连假日也不放松学习。虽然学习紧张，他们还都能积极担任社会工作，参加政治活动。有些工农学生虽然基础很差，可是进步很快，不仅很快赶上了一般水平，而且成绩优异。上海第二医学院四年级工农学生最多的四个班，成了这个学校几年来学习成绩和学风最好的班级。
    检查中发现各校在关心和培养工农学生方面都做了一些工作。例如有些学校在工农学生较多的专业为他们单独编班，挑选讲课较好的教师给他们上课等等。但总的说来，还注意得不够。
    许多高等学校已结合整改检查批判了对工农学生学习上的困难袖手旁观、单纯指责以至鄙视等错误思想；同时采取了改进措施，让学习困难的工农学生免修或缓修部分次要课程，以便他们负担减轻、集中力量学好主要课程；还在部分课程如外文上为他们单独开班，放慢进度；指定班级学习指导教师对他们个别辅导；对学习困难很大的工农学生减免其社会工作，放宽对工农学生因功课成绩差而退学、留级的标准和临时补助标准等等。复旦大学化学系邀请了有经验的教授和讲师特别为工农学生辅导数学和化学。
    在加强培养在校工农学生的同时，各学校都提出了扩大工农学生来源、逐步提高学生中工农成分比重的具体要求。华东纺织工学院决定今后几年内在招收的新生中，争取达到三分之一的工农成分。
