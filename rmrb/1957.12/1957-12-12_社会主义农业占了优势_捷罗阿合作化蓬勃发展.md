    Socialist Agriculture Takes the Upper Hand
    Czechoslovakian Agricultural Cooperativization Flourishes
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 11th – This year has been the year with the fastest progress in the agricultural cooperativization movement in Czechoslovakia. From the beginning of the year to now, a total of 3,150 unified agricultural cooperatives have been newly established in various regions. The number of new cooperative members nationwide has increased by more than 253,000, and the cultivated land has increased by more than 1.15 million hectares.
    At present, there are 11,103 unified agricultural cooperatives in the country. As of the end of October, the cultivated land area of cooperatives has accounted for 62.96% of the country's cultivated land area. Together with state-owned farms, the socialist economy has taken a dominant position in the countryside.
    The development of the agricultural cooperativization movement this year was most prominent in August and September. In the first twenty days of August alone, six hundred cooperatives were established, equivalent to 50% of the number established throughout last year. Now, there are one hundred and two counties in the country where every village has a cooperative.
    Unified agricultural cooperatives have demonstrated the great superiority of socialist large-scale agriculture over individual farming operations in many aspects. In terms of the increase in yield per unit area, the land cultivated by individual farmers increased by only 5% in the four years from 1953 to 1956, while the output of cooperatives increased by 15%. In 1956, the income per hectare of land in cooperatives was 2,470 crowns, while it was only 1,932 crowns for individual farmers.
    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 11th – According to the "Free Romania" newspaper, by November 1st, Romania had established nearly 14,000 collective farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and joint cultivation societies. They include more than 1.5 million farm households and more than 3 million hectares of land.
    The socialist sector in agriculture, including state-owned farms, already owns 46% of the country's arable land.
    In the past two years, the area of land cooperativized in Romania has more than doubled, and the number of cooperative organizations has more than doubled.
    At the same time, the economic strength of collective farms and agricultural cooperatives has also grown. This year, collective farms harvested 958,000 tons of grain, accounting for 9.6% of the country's total grain harvest.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 11th – At present, the number of agricultural cooperatives in Albania has grown to about 1,700, with cooperative member households accounting for almost half of the country's total number of farm households, and cultivated land accounting for more than 58% of the country's total cultivated land area.
    The number of agricultural cooperatives newly established in Albania this year is close to the total number of agricultural cooperatives established in the previous ten years. At the end of last year, the number of cooperatives increased from 318 at the end of 1955 to 881.
    The state has provided great assistance to agricultural cooperatives. Twenty-two machine tractor stations regularly provide field work services for cooperatives. This year, the government allocated 430 million leks (Albanian currency) to help the development of cooperatives.

    社会主义农业占了优势
    捷罗阿合作化蓬勃发展
    新华社布拉格11日电　今年是捷克斯洛伐克农业合作化运动进展速度最快的一年。从年初到现在，各地总共新建立了三千一百五十个统一农业合作社。全国合作社新增加的社员有二十五万三千多人、耕地有一百一十五万多公顷。
    现在，全国有统一农业合作社一万一千一百零三个。截至10月末，合作社的耕地面积已经占全国耕地面积的62.96％。连同国营农场一起，社会主义经济在农村中已居于优势的地位。
    今年农业合作化运动的发展以8、9两个月的成绩最为突出，仅在8月份头二十天内就建立了六百个合作社，等于去年全年建社数目的50％。现在，全国有一百零二个县已经村村都有合作社。
    统一农业合作社从许多方面表现了社会主义大规模农业对个体农业经营的巨大优越性。从单位面积产量的增加来看，个体农民耕作的土地在1953年到1956年的四年间只增加了5％，而合作社的产量却增加了15％。1956年合作社每公顷土地收入二千四百七十克朗，个体农民只有一千九百三十二克朗。
    据新华社布加勒斯特11日电据“自由罗马尼亚”报报道，到11月1日为止，罗马尼亚已经建立了将近一万四千个集体农庄、农业生产合作社和共耕社。它们包括有一百五十多万户农民和三百多万公顷土地。
    包括国营农场在内的农业中的社会主义部分，已经拥有全国可耕地的46％。
    在最近两年中，罗马尼亚全国合作化了的土地面积增加了一倍以上，合作组织的数目增加了一倍多。
    和这同时，集体农庄和农业合作社的经济力量也增长了。今年集体农庄收获了九十五万八千吨谷物，占全国谷物总收获量9.6％。
    新华社地拉那11日电　目前阿尔巴尼亚农业合作社的数目已经发展到约一千七百个，入社农户几乎占到全国农户总数的一半，耕地占全国耕地总面积的58％以上。
    阿尔巴尼亚今年一年新建的农业合作社接近于以往十年所建立的农业合作社的总数。去年年底，合作社的数目从1955年年底的三百一十八个增加到了八百八十一个。
    国家对农业合作社给予了很大的帮助。有二十二个机器拖拉机站经常为合作社田间工作服务。今年，政府拨作帮助合作社发展的款项达到四亿三千万里克（阿币）。
