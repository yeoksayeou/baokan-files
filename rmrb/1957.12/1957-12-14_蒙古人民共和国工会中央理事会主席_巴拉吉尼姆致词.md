　　Dear comrades:
    I am greatly honored to have the opportunity to represent the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Mongolian People's Republic and all its members in extending our heartfelt, fraternal, and warm greetings to you—the representatives of the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, and through you, to the great Chinese working class.

    The present period is a period in which the socialist system has become the superior system in the world, a period in which the colonialist system is irretrievably heading towards collapse, a period in which the heroic struggles of the people in colonies and dependencies who are filled with hatred for the expansionist policies of colonialism and imperialism have entered a new stage, and a period in which the progressive people of the whole world have launched a united struggle to strive for the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and to consolidate lasting peace. The Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions is being convened precisely during such a period. This congress is being convened at a very significant time: at a time when the great Soviet Union first successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile and the first artificial earth satellite, and later launched the second artificial earth satellite; at a time when the defensive strength of the socialist camp has been greatly enhanced.

    The victory of the great Chinese New Democratic Revolution and the birth of the People's Republic of China is the largest historical event in the world after the great October Socialist Revolution.

    The establishment of the People's Republic of China is of great significance for safeguarding and consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

    Chinese trade unions and the working class, together with all the laborers, under the leadership of their glorious Communist Party, have made great achievements in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, transforming a backward agricultural China into a country with modern technology and equipment, completely eliminating backwardness in agriculture and realizing agricultural collectivization, further developing socialist culture on the basis of the great ancient cultural heritage, and improving the material welfare of the working people.

    These facts prove to the world that our socialist system has unparalleled superiority.

    The heroic Chinese working class, in a great and difficult period, built and renovated hundreds of large-scale projects in accordance with the provisions of the First Five-Year Plan, such as the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the Yangtze River Bridge, and the Fengman Hydropower Station.

    Based on the successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan and the development of industry, the industrious Chinese people have achieved great successes in raising the material and cultural level of the working people. The wages of employees are constantly increasing, employee housing is being built in large numbers, labor insurance funds have greatly increased, and illiteracy is rapidly decreasing.

    These creative and tremendous achievements of the Chinese people have won the deep sympathy of all progressive people, including the Mongolian people, and make them feel very happy.

    The trade unions of the Mongolian People's Republic, learning from the rich experiences of the Soviet and Chinese trade unions, play an important role in the socialist construction of their own country. They actively participate in the country's political and economic life and further develop the people's democratic system based on the alliance of the working class and the laboring herdsmen.

    Thanks to the fraternal and selfless assistance of our great neighbors, the Soviet Union and China, the Mongolian People's Republic has made great progress in developing its economy and culture in recent years.

    Many new industrial sectors, such as the mining industry, the petroleum industry, and railways, have developed in recent years.

    The number of livestock in animal husbandry, our most important economic sector, has increased, and the utilization rate of livestock products has increased.

    At present, the number of employees in our country accounts for 27% of the total population, and 84.5% of employees enjoying social insurance are trade union members.

    The working people of our country have successfully completed the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the Mongolian People's Republic and are working to complete the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. In the past three years, the output of state-owned and cooperative industries has increased by 48%, and there have been tremendous achievements in culture, science, and art. Illiteracy has been basically eliminated. Now, one out of every eight people in our country is studying.

    In the past four years, the employee wage fund has increased by 73.6%, real wages have increased by 40%, and the income of herdsmen and agricultural production cooperative members has increased by 57%.

    Socialist emulation has played a great role in completing and overfulfilling the plans for the development of the national economy and in raising labor productivity. At present, 95% of the workers in our country participate in socialist emulation, and the number of rationalization proposers is increasing day by day. All this has made the material and cultural life of the working people in our country continuously improve.

    The resolutions of the Fourth World Trade Union Congress held not long ago are of great historical significance for the World Federation of Trade Unions in defending the political and economic rights of the working people and strengthening the international solidarity of trade unions.

    The Mongolian trade unions' ties with the member organizations of the World Federation of Trade Unions are expanding day by day in the cause of defending the rights and interests of the working people.

    Dear comrades: The Mongolian people and the Chinese people have been friendly since ancient times. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, a new stage began in the history of the fraternal friendly cooperation between our two peoples. The Mongolian people are infinitely delighted with the strong and selfless assistance that the Chinese people have given to our country's socialist construction. Because our people deeply know that this kind of assistance is of great significance for consolidating the strength of the socialist camp, consolidating the unity of all nations, and safeguarding and consolidating world peace. Our task is to develop and consolidate this friendship and connection in every possible way.

    It is particularly necessary to point out the important significance of the mutual contact between the trade unions of our two countries and the mutual dispatch of trade union delegations and recuperation personnel. We express our heartfelt gratitude to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for the great and selfless assistance given to our trade unions.

    The US imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek clique have been obstructing the Mongolian People's Republic and the People's Republic of China from obtaining their due status in the United Nations until now. However, the Mongolian People's Republic firmly believes that with the support of the world's progressive forces that respect the freedom and independence of all nations, our two countries will surely be able to obtain their due status in the United Nations in the near future.

    I wish the Chinese trade unions and the heroic Chinese working class new and brilliant achievements in successfully implementing the resolutions of the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions and further improving the material and cultural living standards of the working people, in the cause of building socialism and safeguarding world peace!

    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese people!

    Long live world peace!

　　蒙古人民共和国工会中央理事会主席
    巴拉吉尼姆致词敬爱的同志们：
    我感到十分荣幸，能有机会代表蒙古人民共和国工会中央理事会和全体会员向你们——中国工会第八次全国代表大会的代表们，并且通过你们，向伟大的中国工人阶级致以衷心的、兄弟般的热烈敬礼。
    目前的时期，是社会主义制度已经成为世界上的优越制度的时期，是殖民主义制度正在无可挽救地走向崩溃的时期，是对殖民主义和帝国主义的扩张政策满怀着仇恨的殖民地和附属国人民的英雄斗争已经进入了崭新阶段的时期，是全世界进步人类为争取禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器、争取巩固持久和平而展开了统一的斗争的时期。中国工会第八次全国代表大会正是在这样的时期召开的。这次代表大会，是在一个十分有意义的时期召开的：在这个时期里，伟大的苏联第一个成功地发射了洲际弹道导弹和第一颗人造地球卫星，以后又发射了第二颗人造地球卫星；在这个时期里，社会主义阵营的防御力量大大地增强了。
    伟大的中国新民主主义革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的诞生，是继伟大的十月社会主义革命之后世界上最大的一个历史事件。
    中华人民共和国的成立，对保卫和巩固亚洲和世界和平具有极大的意义。
    中国工会和工人阶级跟全体劳动者一起，在自己的光荣的共产党领导下，在巩固人民民主专政，把落后的农业中国变为有现代技术装备的、彻底消灭农业中的落后性和实现农业合作化的国家，在伟大的古老文化遗产的基础上进一步发展社会主义文化，以及在提高劳动人民物质福利等各个方面，都获得了巨大的成就。
    这些事实向全世界证明，我们的社会主义制度有着无比的优越性。
    英雄的中国工人阶级在伟大而困难的时期里，按照第一个五年计划的规定，新建和改建成数以百计的大型工程，如鞍山钢铁公司、长春第一汽车制造厂、长江大桥和丰满水电站等等。
    勤劳的中国人民在顺利完成第一个五年计划和发展工业的基础上，在提高劳动人民物质与文化水平方面获得了巨大的成就。职工的工资正在不断地提高，职工住宅正在大量修建，劳动保险基金大大增加了，文盲在迅速地减少着。
    中国人民的这些创造性的巨大成就，赢得了包括蒙古人民在内的全体进步人类的深切同情，使他们感到非常高兴。
    蒙古人民共和国工会学习苏联和中国工会的丰富经验，在自己祖国的社会主义建设中起着重要作用，它积极地参与国家的政治经济生活，进一步发展了建立在工人阶级和劳动牧民联盟基础上的人民民主制度。
    由于我们伟大的邻邦苏联和中国的兄弟般的无私援助，蒙古人民共和国最近几年在发展自己的经济与文化方面获得了巨大的进展。
    许多新的工业部门如采矿工业、石油工业、铁路等等，最近几年都得到了发展。
    我国最重要的经济部门畜牧业的牲畜头数增加了，畜产品的利用率日益提高。
    现在我国职工人数已经占全国居民的27％，享受社会保险的职工中有84.5％是工会会员。
    我国劳动人民顺利地完成了蒙古人民共和国国民经济发展的第一个五年计划，正在为提前完成第二个五年计划而劳动着。最近三年，国营和合作社营工业的产量提高了48％，文化、科学、艺术方面也有巨大的成就，文盲已经基本上消灭了。现在我国全体居民中，每八个人中就有一个人在学习。
    在最近四年内，职工工资基金增加了73.6％，实际工资增加了40％，牧民和农业生产合作社社员的收入增加了57％。
    社会主义竞赛对完成和超额完成发展国民经济计划和提高劳动生产率起了很大的作用。现在我国95％的工人参加了社会主义竞赛，合理化建议者的人数日益增多。这一切使得我国劳动人民的物质和文化生活不断得到提高。
    不久以前召开的世界工会第四次代表大会的决议对世界工联保卫劳动人民的政治和经济权利、加强工会的国际团结具有重大的历史意义。
    蒙古工会在保卫劳动人民的权利和利益的事业中，与世界工联各会员组织的联系正在日益扩大。
    亲爱的同志们：蒙古人民和中国人民很早以前就是友好的，在中华人民共和国成立以后，在我们两国人民的兄弟般的友好合作的历史中开始了新的阶段。蒙古人民对于中国人民在我国社会主义建设中所给予的大力的、无私的帮助感到无限欢欣。因为我国人民深深地知道这种帮助对于巩固社会主义阵营的力量、巩固各民族的团结、保卫和巩固世界和平具有伟大的意义。我们的任务，是用一切办法发展并巩固这种友谊和联系。
    特别需要指出的是，我们两国工会的相互联系和互相派遣工会代表团与休养人员的重要意义。对中华全国总工会给予我国工会的巨大的、无私的帮助，我们致以衷心的感谢。
    美帝国主义者和蒋介石集团一直到现在还阻碍蒙古人民共和国和中华人民共和国在联合国得到应有的地位。但是蒙古人民共和国深信，在尊重各族人民的自由和独立的世界进步力量的支持下，我们两国在不久以后一定能够在联合国中取得应有的地位。
    祝中国工会和英勇的中国工人阶级在顺利贯彻中国工会第八次全国代表大会决议和进一步提高劳动人民物质与文化生活水平的工作中，在建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的事业中获得新的光辉的成就！
    蒙中两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
