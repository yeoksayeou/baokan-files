Why Does Frozen Tofu Have So Many Small Holes?

　　Tofu contains a lot of moisture. When this moisture freezes into ice, because ice has a larger volume than water, it causes the tofu block to expand and become loose. After the ice melts, the volume of water is smaller than that of ice, and the tofu block cannot shrink back, thus forming many small holes.

    冻豆腐为什么有许多小孔？
    豆腐内含有许多水分。当这些水分冻冰时，因为冰比水的体积大，就使豆腐块胀大、发松。等冰融化后，水的体积又比冰小了，而豆腐块不能再缩回去，因而形成许多小孔。
