    Old Woman Wang Actively Eliminates the Four Pests
    Xu Kechang
    In Nanxun Town, Wang A’jin, a sixty-year-old family member of a worker, has become famous for her remarkable fly-swatting achievements. For several years, she has been fighting against flies. In 1952, she eliminated 100,000 flies; in 1953, 180,000; in 1954, 61,000; in 1955, 50,000; in 1956, 162,000; and this year, up to now, she has eliminated more than 130,000. Adding these numbers up, it comes to: 683,000 flies. What a huge number!
    Old Woman Wang A’jin is recognized by all the residents of the town as the most outstanding activist in eliminating the four pests. She has come up with many ways to trap flies. She often places fresh fish innards or shrimp shells in places like river docks, intersections, and courtyards to attract flies, making it easier to swat them in large numbers.
    People can hardly believe that Old Woman Wang A’jin has broken seventy-seven fly swatters in recent years. As long as there are flies, her fly swatter is never out of her hand. Her family's economic situation is not good, and she doesn't have money to buy fly swatters, so she searches everywhere for broken glass, washes it clean, and sells it to the state's waste product purchasing station, using the money to buy fly swatters. From last winter to this spring alone, she picked up 142 jin of broken glass and sold it all to the state.
    This old woman often motivates residents to swat flies together. During the summer vacation and on Sundays, the surrounding children are her best companions. She often takes the children to the streets, alleys, bridges, slaughterhouses, and other places to swat flies. She also often provides the children with fly swatters she has made. The fly-swatting methods she employs are highly valued by everyone. When flies cannot be found in the town, she also leads her companions to the countryside four or five li away from the town to look for flies, using practical actions to encourage farmers to eliminate the four pests.
    Old Woman Wang A’jin not only vigorously swats flies but also actively participates in the work of dredging sewers, overturning jars and dumping bowls, handling manure vats, and digging up fly pupae throughout the town. She always strives to be the first to do it, unafraid of filth and trouble. She also uses water tanks, kerosene tanks, rat traps, and mousetraps to catch rats. In this year alone, she has caught and killed 158 rats by herself.
    Old Woman Wang A’jin also does a very good job in managing her household thriftily. Her husband is an employee in the catering industry, and her sixteen-year-old child is studying. This sixty-year-old woman, in addition to doing housework, also raises a pig, more than twenty chickens, seven ducks, and twelve rabbits. All these poultry and livestock rely on her to find feed in the wild to survive. Duckweed from ponds, watermelon rinds from the streets, and fish and shrimp innards and shells are all collected by her as feed, without wasting any grain. The chickens and ducks she raises are very large, and the eggs they lay are also very large and plentiful. She has also opened up five pieces of wasteland, planting wheat, broad beans, soybeans, sesame, green vegetables, and pumpkins. She sells most of the agricultural and livestock products to the state, depositing the proceeds in the bank and buying public bonds.
    Old Woman Wang A’jin is not only active in her work but also in good health. In recent years, she has not been sick, works all day long without fatigue, and can still carry heavy loads of more than 130 jin. Her good achievements in eliminating the four pests and managing her household thriftily have won the praise of all the residents of the town. She has been named a first-class fly-swatting expert in Nanxun Town three times in a row and has attended the Jiaxing Special District Advanced Health Workers' Representative Conference and the Provincial Workers' Family Members' Representative Conference. Deputy County Head Wu Xingqin and Deputy County Head Sui also made a special trip to Nanxun Town to visit her. The honor that Old Woman Wang A’jin has received is the result of her consistent active labor.

    王老太太积极除四害
    徐克昌
    在南浔镇，六十岁的工人家属王阿金老太太以惊人的灭蝇成绩出了名。她几年来一直和苍蝇进行着斗争。1952年她消灭了苍蝇十万只；1953年十八万只；1954年六万一千只；1955年五万只；1956年十六万二千只；今年，到目前为止，已消灭了十三万多只。把这些数目加起来是：六十八万三千多只。这是一个多么巨大的数字！
    王阿金老太太是全镇居民所公认的最优秀的除四害积极分子。她想了许多办法诱捕苍蝇。她常常在河埠、路口、庭院等场所，放置鲜鱼的内脏或虾壳，引诱苍蝇聚集，以便于大量扑灭。
    人们几乎不能相信：王阿金老太太几年来已打破了七十七个苍蝇拍。只要是有苍蝇的日子，她的蝇拍就不离手。她家里经济条件并不好，没有钱买蝇拍，她就到处寻找碎玻璃，洗净后卖给国家废品收购站，再用卖得的钱去买蝇拍。光是去年冬天到今年春天，她就拾了碎玻璃一百四十二斤，全部卖给了国家。
    这位老太太常常带动居民一起来扑打苍蝇。在暑期和星期天，周围的小朋友就是她最好的伙伴。她常常带着孩子们到街头、里弄、桥梁、屠宰场等地方去扑打苍蝇。她还常常把自己做成的蝇拍供给孩子们使用。她所采用的灭蝇方法，受到大家的重视。在镇上找不到苍蝇时，她还带动伙伴到离镇四、五里外的农村里去寻找苍蝇，以实际行动来鼓舞农民消灭四害。
    王阿金老太太不但大力扑灭苍蝇，而且在全镇进行疏通阴沟、翻缸倒钵、处理粪缸、挖掘蝇蛹等工作时，也积极地参加。她总是争先去做，不怕龌龊，不怕麻烦。她也用水缸、火油箱、捕鼠笼、鼠夹等捕捉老鼠。在今年一年内，她一个人就捕灭了老鼠一百五十八只。
    王阿金老太太在勤俭持家方面也做得很出色。她的丈夫是一个饮食行业的职工，她的十六岁的孩子正在读书。这位六十岁的老太太，除了从事家务劳动外，还养了一头猪、二十多只鸡、七只鸭子和十二只兔子。这许多禽畜，全靠她到野外寻找饲料来养活。池塘里的浮萍、街头的西瓜皮和鱼虾的内脏和壳，都是她收集的饲料，一点也不浪费粮食。她养的鸡鸭都很大，下的蛋也很多很大。她还开辟了五处荒地，种植小麦、蚕豆、黄豆、芝麻、青菜和南瓜。她把大部分农产品和畜产品卖给国家，把所得的钱存入银行和购买公债。
    王阿金老太太不但工作积极，而且身体健康。这些年来，她没有生过病，整天劳动，不知疲倦，直到现在，还能挑一百三十多斤的重担。她的扑灭四害、勤俭持家的良好成绩，获得全镇居民的赞扬。她连续三次被评为南浔镇的一等灭蝇能手，出席了嘉兴专区先进卫生工作者代表会议和省职工家属代表会议。吴兴县钦副县长和隋副县长还特地到南浔镇去访问了她。王阿金老太太获得的光荣，是她一贯积极劳动的结果。
