Xinhua News Agency, 11th -- The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission recently held its first plenary session of the second committee.

This meeting was convened during the high tide of the socialist revolution on the ideological and political fronts across the country. The meeting summarized the achievements of overseas Chinese affairs work over the past eight years, further affirmed the socialist line for overseas Chinese affairs, criticized the rightist words and deeds that undermine the overseas Chinese affairs policy, and examined the shortcomings and errors of the overseas Chinese affairs departments in implementing policies. Furthermore, based on the fundamental principles of proceeding from the 600 million people, taking into account all aspects, and making appropriate arrangements, as well as the spirit of "building the country diligently and frugally, running the cooperatives diligently and frugally, and managing the household diligently and frugally," the meeting discussed how to mobilize overseas Chinese dependents and returned overseas Chinese to actively participate in the large-scale production movement, actively participate in the nationwide rectification movement, strengthen their socialist ideological education, and resolutely guide them to successfully pass the socialist test.

At the opening of the meeting, He Xiangning, director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, delivered a report on current issues in overseas Chinese affairs work, and Fang Fang, deputy director, conveyed Premier Zhou Enlai's instructions on the guidelines for overseas Chinese affairs work. In group discussions and plenary speeches, the committee members unanimously supported Premier Zhou Enlai's instructions and agreed with Director He Xiangning's report. Before the conclusion of the meeting, Deputy Director Liao Chengzhi gave a report on some of the main issues in current overseas Chinese affairs work; Deputy Director Fang Fang gave a concluding report, answering the questions raised in the discussions.

The meeting held that the achievements of overseas Chinese affairs work over the past eight years have been tremendous. In various domestic reform and transformation movements, the state adhered to the principle of mobilizing overseas Chinese dependents and returned overseas Chinese together with all the people, while appropriately taking into account their special characteristics, enabling the vast majority of overseas Chinese dependents and returned overseas Chinese to embark on the socialist road together with the people of the whole country. Currently, over 95% of overseas Chinese households have joined agricultural production cooperatives, of which approximately 80% have joined advanced cooperatives. Generally, 65% to 70% of overseas Chinese households joining cooperatives have increased their income; in well-run cooperatives, over 90% of overseas Chinese households have increased their income. Domestic overseas Chinese capital industrial and commercial enterprises have also basically participated in joint state-private ownership across the entire industry, and have been incorporated into the orbit of socialist construction. After joining cooperatives, overseas Chinese handicraft households have had their skills developed and their lives appropriately arranged. Along with the change in ownership, their thinking has also been correspondingly transformed. Bad habits left over from the old society in the overseas Chinese areas are gradually being eliminated, and a new atmosphere of honorable labor and frugal household management has gradually taken shape. The state has also implemented the principle of mobilizing all positive forces to serve socialist construction in overseas Chinese affairs work, encouraging and guiding overseas Chinese dependents and returned overseas Chinese to actively participate in socialist construction. More than 200,000 returned overseas Chinese who have returned to the country successively since liberation have all been properly arranged. Over the years, overseas Chinese students returning to China to pursue their studies have been guided by the government to study in schools at all levels, and now about 1,500 have graduated from universities and embarked on the glorious post of building the motherland. The amount of overseas Chinese investment returning to China has increased year by year, about five times that of 1952 in 1956.

The meeting pointed out that abroad, the vast majority of overseas Chinese are increasingly closely united around the motherland. Chiang Kai-shek's gang of secret agents is increasingly isolated. The friendship between overseas Chinese and the people of their countries of residence has also greatly increased, which is conducive to promoting friendly relations between our country and the countries of residence.

The meeting seriously criticized some right-wing remarks and behaviors that violated the socialist overseas Chinese affairs line. The meeting unanimously affirmed the necessity of carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture and implementing agricultural cooperation in overseas Chinese hometowns, and emphasized that the special needs of overseas Chinese dependents and returned overseas Chinese for grain and other state-purchased and marketed materials must be appropriately taken care of under the premise of complying with the policies of state purchase and marketing. The meeting pointed out that the state's redemption policy for capitalist industry and commerce also applies to private industrial and commercial enterprises run by returned overseas Chinese, and affirmed that the state's policy of resettling returned overseas Chinese "according to their place of origin, mainly oriented to rural areas, and employing those with skills according to their abilities" is completely correct, pointing out that a small number of overseas Chinese dependents, returned overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students who use "special" as an excuse to disregard state laws, undermine state purchase and marketing policies, undermine cooperation, engage in smuggling and foreign exchange speculation, fail to observe labor discipline, and engage in hooliganism are not tolerated by state law.

Based on the spirit of rectification, and combined with the opinions put forward to the overseas Chinese affairs departments during the upsurge of airing views and speaking out freely, the meeting focused on examining the shortcomings and errors in domestic overseas Chinese affairs work. These are mainly manifested in the fact that some work is superficial, shallow, lacking in foresight and consideration, and lacks active education, unilaterally emphasizing care; the work of guiding overseas Chinese dependents and returned overseas Chinese to participate in labor production is not enough, especially for overseas Chinese dependents and returned overseas Chinese who rely on overseas remittances for their livelihood, there has not been a good arrangement for labor production according to their characteristics, and there is a lack of planned guidance to channel the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese dependents, returned overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese in building their hometowns into agricultural production and construction; in the process of implementing the socialist overseas Chinese affairs policy, the handling of certain issues has sometimes not been resolute enough; less investigation and research work has been done in areas with fewer overseas Chinese dependents and returned overseas Chinese, and there is also a lack of specific guidance. All of the above have had a certain impact on the work, and must be resolutely rectified and overcome through this rectification movement.

The meeting held that it is necessary to educate overseas Chinese dependents and returned overseas Chinese to love labor, and together with the peasants, actively produce to realize the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), striving to catch up with or exceed the production level and income level of local well-to-do middle peasants within five years. In the coming winter and spring, it is necessary to launch overseas Chinese dependents and returned overseas Chinese into a new upsurge of agricultural production.

The meeting determined that it is necessary to actively mobilize overseas Chinese dependents and returned overseas Chinese to participate in the nationwide rectification movement, and successfully pass the socialist test together with the people of the whole country, so that overseas Chinese dependents and returned overseas Chinese will be educated in the movement, further realizing that in the current major changes in China's social life, they must resolutely transform themselves, and not only ideologically but also in action must more resolutely take the socialist road. In the great debate, speeches and actions against socialism must be seriously criticized and dealt with; backward ideas and speeches must be patiently educated; the measures of various overseas Chinese affairs policies should be explained clearly to cadres and peasants, so that overseas Chinese affairs policies can be further implemented.

The meeting held that domestic overseas Chinese affairs work must solve the special problems of overseas Chinese dependents and returned overseas Chinese according to the principle of proceeding from the 600 million people, "taking into account all aspects, and making appropriate arrangements," and should be carried out under the unified arrangement of the Party, government, cooperatives and relevant units. The principle for handling the problems of overseas Chinese dependents, returned overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese students is: neither can they make special demands, nor can problems that can be solved not be solved for them. It is necessary to implement the spirit of "building the country diligently and frugally" into overseas Chinese affairs work and the lives of overseas Chinese dependents and returned overseas Chinese. For the work of overseas Chinese dependents and returned overseas Chinese, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of diligent production and practicing strict economy. Overseas Chinese affairs departments should streamline their organizations, transfer cadres, and enrich the lower levels.

Regarding current overseas Chinese affairs work abroad, the meeting proposed that in order to better implement the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and enhance the friendly relations between our country and Southeast Asian countries (about 90% of overseas Chinese reside in Southeast Asian countries), and also from the perspective of facilitating the long-term residence of overseas Chinese in the local area, the first thing in overseas Chinese work abroad is to properly solve the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese. It advocates that overseas Chinese choose the nationality of their country of residence according to the principle of voluntariness, and be loyal to the country they choose; secondly, for those who retain Chinese nationality, in addition to complying with the policies and laws of their country of residence and respecting the customs and habits of their country of residence, they should mainly be encouraged to cooperate with local capital in managing overseas Chinese commercial capital, or under the leadership of the local government, develop an economy that is beneficial to local national independence; thirdly, overseas Chinese children should be encouraged to receive education in local languages, texts, geography, history and livelihood skills, respect local culture, respect the local education system, while retaining Chinese language courses for a certain period of time. The relationship within the overseas Chinese community should also implement the spirit of "patriotism as one family," "patriotism regardless of order," "harmony is precious," and "meeting each other with sincerity," commend the tradition of overseas Chinese running welfare undertakings, extensively carry out mutual assistance and mutual benefit, unite all forces that can be united, attack and isolate Chiang Kai-shek's gang of special agents, and smash their conspiracies to harm and deceive the overseas Chinese.

The meeting also pointed out that overseas Chinese live abroad, and their situation is completely different from that of the people in the country. Therefore, the anti-rightist struggle and rectification movement in the country are not necessary abroad, and should not be copied.

The meeting decided to resolutely lead overseas Chinese dependents and returned overseas Chinese to take the socialist road, develop agriculture, and increase their income. The meeting also conducted detailed discussions on the education of returned overseas Chinese, unity, and reception and resettlement work for 1958, several issues concerning the direction and policy of the educational work of returned overseas Chinese students, the future work of guiding overseas Chinese investment, and issues concerning overseas remittances policy, and formulated specific plans.

This meeting was held in Beijing from November 21st to 27th.

The heads of overseas Chinese affairs departments from fourteen provinces and cities including Yunnan, Guangxi, Shandong, Hubei, Zhejiang, Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin attended the meeting.

    扫除执行社会主义侨务路线的障碍
    引导侨眷归侨过好社会主义关
    侨委会举行全体委员会议讨论当前侨务工作
    新华社11日讯　华侨事务委员会最近举行了第二届第一次全体委员会议。
    这次会议是在全国思想战线上和政治战线上的社会主义革命高潮时期召开的。会议总结了八年来侨务工作的成绩，进一步肯定了社会主义的侨务路线，批驳了破坏侨务政策的右派言行，检查了侨务部门在执行政策上的缺点和错误；并且根据从六亿人民出发，统筹兼顾、适当安排的基本方针和“勤俭建国，勤俭办社，勤俭持家”的精神，讨论了如何发动侨眷、归侨积极参加大规模生产运动，积极参加全民性的整风运动，对他们加强社会主义思想教育，坚决引导他们过好社会主义关的问题。
    在这次会议开幕的时候，华侨事务委员会何香凝主任就当前侨务工作问题作了报告，方方副主任传达了周恩来总理历次有关侨务工作方针的指示。委员们在小组讨论和大会发言中，一致拥护周恩来总理的指示，同意何香凝主任的报告。在会议结束以前，廖承志副主任就当前侨务工作的一些主要问题作了报告；方方副主任作了总结报告，回答了讨论中所提出的问题。
    会议认为，八年来，侨务工作的成绩是巨大的。在国内各项的改革、改造运动中，国家坚持了侨眷、归侨和全体人民一齐发动、适当照顾其特点的方针，使绝大部分的侨眷、归侨和全国人民一起走上社会主义道路。目前已有95％以上的侨户参加了农业生产合作社，其中约有80％以上加入高级社。入社侨户一般有65％到70％增加收入；办得好的社有90％以上的侨户增加收入。国内侨资工商业也基本上参加了全行业公私合营，纳入社会主义建设的轨道。手工业侨户参加了合作社以后，技能得到发挥，生活得到适当安排。随着所有制的改变，也使他们的思想得到相应的改造。侨区旧社会遗留下来的坏习惯已经在逐渐消除，劳动光荣和勤俭持家的新风气已逐渐形成。国家还在侨务工作中贯彻了调动一切积极力量为社会主义建设服务的方针，鼓励和引导侨眷、归侨积极参加社会主义建设。解放后陆续回国的二十多万归侨，都得到适当安排。历年回国升学的华侨学生，政府辅导他们进入各级学校学习，现在已有一千五百人左右从高等学校毕业，走上建设祖国的光荣岗位。华侨回国投资额逐年有所增长，1956年为1952年的五倍左右。
    会议指出，在国外，绝大多数的华侨日益紧密地团结在祖国的周围。蒋帮特务分子日益孤立。华侨和侨居国人民的友谊也有了很大的增进，从而有利于促进我国与侨居国的友好关系。
    会议严肃地批判了违反社会主义侨务路线的一些右派言论和行为。会议一致肯定了在侨乡进行农业社会主义改造、实行农业合作化的必要性，并强调侨眷、归侨对粮食等统购统销物资的特殊需求，必须在遵守统购统销政策之下，才能适当照顾。会议指出国家对资本主义工商业实行的赎买政策同样适用于归侨私营工商业，并肯定国家安置归侨“按籍安置，主要面向农村，对有技能者量才录用”的方针是完全正确的，指出少数侨眷、归侨和归国华侨学生中的借口“特殊”而无视国家法律，破坏统购统销政策，破坏合作化，结伙走私套汇，不遵守劳动纪律及流氓行为等，都是国家法律所不容许的。
    会议根据整风的精神，结合在鸣放高潮中对侨务部门所提的意见，着重检查了国内侨务工作的缺点和错误。这主要是在某些工作中表现得华而不实，浮而不深，缺乏瞻前顾后和左顾右盼，积极教育不够，片面强调照顾；引导侨眷归侨参加劳动生产的工作做得不够，尤其是对依靠侨汇为生的侨眷归侨，曾经没有很好地按照他们的特点来安排劳动生产，缺乏有计划地把侨眷归侨和华侨建设家乡的积极性引导到农业生产建设方面；在贯彻执行社会主义侨务政策的过程中，对某些问题的处理，有时表现不够坚决；对侨眷归侨较少的地区，少作调查研究工作，也缺乏具体指导。以上这些，都曾经使工作受到一定的影响，必须通过这次整风运动，坚决加以整顿和克服。
    会议认为，要教育侨眷归侨热爱劳动，同农民一起，为实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的指标而积极生产，争取在五年内赶上或超过当地富裕中农的生产水平和收入水平。在今冬明春，要发动侨眷归侨投入新的农业生产高潮。
    会议确定，要积极发动侨眷、归侨参加全民性的整风运动，同全国人民一起过好社会主义关，使侨眷归侨在运动中人人受到教育，进一步认识到在当前我国社会生活大变革中，必须坚决改造自己，不仅在思想上而且在行动上要更加坚决地走社会主义道路。在大辩论中，对反对社会主义的言行，必须严肃批判处理；对落后的思想和言论，要耐心地进行教育；对各项侨务政策的措施，应该向干部、农民解释清楚，使侨务政策得到进一步贯彻执行。
    会议认为，国内侨务工作必须根据从六亿人民出发，“统筹兼顾，适当安排”的方针解决侨眷、归侨的特殊问题，在党、政、合作社和有关单位统一安排之下进行。对侨眷、归侨和归侨学生的问题，处理的方针是：既不能闹特殊化，也不能对能解决的问题不替他们解决。必须将“勤俭建国”的精神贯彻到侨务工作和侨眷、归侨的生活中去。对侨眷、归侨的工作，必须坚持勤劳生产和厉行节约的原则。侨务部门要紧缩机构，下放干部，充实下层。
    关于当前国外侨务工作，会议提出，为了更好地贯彻和平共处五项原则的精神，增进我国同东南亚各国（国外华侨大约90％侨居在东南亚各国）的友好关系，同时也从便利华侨在当地长远居留着想，国外华侨工作首先是妥善地解决华侨的双重国籍问题。主张让华侨根据自愿原则，选择侨居国国籍，效忠于所选择的国家；其次，对于部分保留中国国籍的人，除了必须遵守侨居国的政策法令、尊重侨居国的风俗习惯以外，主要是鼓励华侨商业资本和当地资本合作经营，或在当地政府领导下，发展有利于当地民族独立的经济；再次是要鼓励华侨子女接受当地语言文字、地理历史和谋生技术的教育，尊重当地文化，尊重当地教育制度，同时保留一定时间的华文课程。对华侨内部的关系还应贯彻“爱国一家”、“爱国不分先后”、“和为贵”、“相见以诚”的精神，表扬华侨兴办福利的传统，广泛开展互助互济，团结一切可能团结的力量，打击、孤立蒋帮特务罪魁，粉碎他们祸侨害侨的阴谋罪行。
    会议还指出，华侨生活在国外，他们和国内人民的处境完全不同，因此国内的反右派斗争和整风运动，在国外没有必要，更不能抄袭。
    会议决定，要坚决地领导侨眷、归侨走社会主义道路，发展农业，使他们增加收入。会议还对1958年度归国华侨团结教育和接待、安置工作，归国华侨学生教育工作方针、政策的若干问题，今后辅导华侨投资工作问题，关于侨汇政策问题，进行了详尽的讨论，并且拟定了具体的方案。
    这次会是11月21日到27日在北京举行的。
    云南、广西、山东、湖北、浙江、北京、上海、天津等十四个省、市侨务部门的负责人列席了这次会议。
