China's First 800 Jin Special Zone
By our reporter Huang Xiangqing

Not necessarily favorable weather

As early as 1956, the Shantou Special Zone in Guangdong Province became the first special zone in the country with a grain yield of 800 jin per mu. The average yield of 5,640,000 mu of grain land in 15 counties and 2 suburban districts of the special zone was 811.6 jin.

In 1955, Chao'an, Chenghai, and Chaoyang counties in this special zone became counties with a grain yield of 1,000 jin. In 1956, Jieyang, Puning, and Nan'ao counties and the suburban districts of Shantou and Chaozhou cities also exceeded the 1,000 jin level. In this way, the Chaoshan Plain, with about 2 million mu of cultivated land in the lower reaches of the Han River, became a plain with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu.

Now, the late rice in the whole area has not yet been completely harvested, but news of victory has been coming in one after another. Each of the thousand-jin counties has generally achieved the goal of stabilizing yields first in high-yield areas, and some counties have continued to improve while maintaining stability. Among them, Chenghai County increased its yield by 24 jin per mu compared with 1956, and 248 jin higher than in 1955 when it became a "thousand-jin county," ranking first in the country in terms of grain yield per unit area with 1,257 jin per mu. The average yield per mu in Chaoan County reached 1,233 jin. This year, other counties with lower yields are also catching up closely.

Why has the Shantou Special Zone achieved such outstanding achievements in grain production? Are there any particularly superior conditions? This is a question that almost every visiting delegation pays close attention to. A member of the Rice Visiting Group from the twelve central and southern provinces of China once conducted an experiment in Nanmen Township, Chaoyang County. He grabbed a handful of soil from a field with a yield of more than 1,200 jin per mu, washed it with water, and after the soil was washed away, half a handful of sand grains remained in his hand. The soil quality was not very good.

Not only is the soil quality not good, but other natural conditions are also not very good. In the counties of the Chaoshan Plain, high-lying areas are afraid of drought, low-lying areas are prone to flooding, and typhoons, saltwater tides, and floods along the coast and rivers are a scourge. Although there is a lot of rainfall here, it is concentrated in May to July, and other seasons are often affected by drought.

In recent years, there have been few years of favorable weather. In the autumn of 1953 and 1954, there were fierce typhoons of about magnitude 10. Since then, there have been disasters every year. The Shantou Special Zone has achieved victory on the agricultural front in these years of constant disasters.

Seize key measures

The Party and government leading organs in the Shantou area have long recognized that "without water conservancy construction, there will be no agricultural production." In the winter of 1955, the realization of cooperation set off an unprecedented water conservancy construction movement. The secretary of the prefectural committee personally went to the construction site to direct and lead the construction. For some joint county and joint district projects that completely eliminate water and drought disasters, they also relied on the masses to contribute their efforts, and the local government and agricultural cooperatives raised funds themselves, adhering to the principle of "resolutely doing what can be done." For example, the Rong (River) irrigation project completed in 1956 extended the canal for more than 180 kilometers, solving the irrigation of 450,000 mu of land in Puning and Chaoyang counties and eliminating the threat of tidal surges. Of the 5,310,000 mu of paddy fields in the entire region, 3,520,000 mu have a drought resistance capacity of more than 60 days, accounting for about 66%; the 913 kilometers of flood control dikes in the entire region can ensure that ordinary floods do not breach, and the 400 kilometers of seawalls can also withstand typhoons and sea tides of about magnitude 10. In short, the fundamental change in water conservancy conditions is the guarantee for Shantou to become an "800-jin special zone."

Carrying out mass fertilizer accumulation campaigns is the second key to agricultural production development. In this area, especially the farmers in the Chaoshan Plain counties with high grain yields, have historically relied on chemical fertilizers, and in many places, farmers have never had the habit of accumulating fertilizer. For example, in Chao'an and Jieyang counties, the use of commercial fertilizer and chemical fertilizer accounted for more than 80% of the total fertilizer used in the past, and many cultivated lands became "like flint when the sun rises and like plaster when it rains." Under the current circumstances where it is impossible to supply large quantities of chemical fertilizers, accumulating fertilizer has become an important method to solve the lack of fertilizer and improve the soil. In the past few years, under the call of the Party to "rely on the mountains when near the mountains, rely on the sea when near the sea, and rely on the soil in the plains," the cutting of green manure, the digging of sea mud, pond mud, river mud, and underground "sea mud" has formed a heated movement. In order to dig up fertile mud, many places drained small rivers and ponds that had not been drained for decades. The farmers proudly declared: "We must dig to the corner of the Dragon King's house." The masses also continuously found many sources of fertilizer, such as the discovery and exploitation of "sea mud" hidden underground along the lower reaches of the Han River. This "sea mud" contains 40% of semi-rotted organic matter and is rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, breaking the saying that "there is no fertilizer to accumulate in the plains." After cooperation, the method of accumulating fertilizer of "five diligences and six haves" was truly realized. ("Five diligences" are diligent picking, diligent sweeping, diligent cutting, diligent digging, and diligent planting; "six haves" are pigs have pens, cattle have fences, ashes have houses, manure has pools, people have toilets, and chickens and ducks have roosts.) Farmers in many places even collect wash water, urine stains, chimney ash, and other odds and ends to make fertilizer.

The efforts made by the Shantou area to improve farming methods and improve technical levels are praised by the farmers of the whole province. In Guangdong, some people say that the meticulousness of farming by farmers in the Chaoshan area is "like embroidery." In the past, the highest yield in this area was 500 jin, which was the highest yield in the province. In the production movement in the past few years, the farming methods summarized include: meticulous land preparation, cultivating strong seedlings, timely transplanting, checking seedlings and replanting missing ones, cultivating and weeding, rational fertilization, rational drainage and irrigation, etc. Some successful experiences and excellent grain varieties from other regions have also been introduced and promoted. For example, in the past few years, the entire region has achieved two "izations": one is "small clumps and dense planting," and the other is "early rice varieties being Nantanese (Nante No. 16 rice variety)." Fields with small clumps and dense planting yielded more than 10% more than the old method. Under the same farming conditions, using Nante No. 16 for early rice yields 101 jin more than ordinary seeds. Recently, a new Jiangnan No. 1224 seed has been introduced. Individual tests have shown that it can increase the yield by 30 jin per mu compared to the Nante variety.

In the final analysis, it is a matter of "doing"

Why has the Shantou area been able to achieve such great results by relying on these measures? The reporter once talked about this issue with Luo Tian, the first secretary of the Shantou Prefectural Committee, Zheng Xi, the deputy secretary, and other members of the prefectural committee. They all said: It seems to be a matter of "doing"! This "doing" is reflected in: The Party committee has always attached importance to leading agricultural production, and has always emphasized that the Party committee should go deep into production and personally grasp production.

The Shantou Prefectural Committee, at any time, emphasized that Party committees at all levels should grasp production with the first leader. When other tasks were heavy, the leaders implemented unified arrangements and appropriate division of labor. From the prefectural committee and county committee to the district committee, village branch committee members, and activists, they were always divided into two teams, so that the two aspects of work could be carried out in parallel, promote each other, and do a good job together. After the sprint tasks were over, Party committees at all levels maintained 70% of their strength on production.

Because the Party committee personally grasps production work, has great determination, stands high, and sees comprehensively, the results of various production work are much greater than relying solely on general business departments. This point is especially evident in water conservancy work. For example, the Ningxi drainage and irrigation canal project in Xingning County requires crossing mountains and ridges, passing through twelve rivers, and extending dozens of kilometers, so that 120,000 mu of land can eliminate water and drought disasters. Individual persons in charge of the Provincial Water Conservancy Department also believed that there were many difficulties, but with the support of the prefectural committee and the county committee personally grasping the command, dozens of cadres were concentrated on the construction site to lead, and more than 50,000 people from various villages were mobilized, and the excavation was successfully completed in just twenty days.

It is worth mentioning the miracle of overcoming the once-in-a-century drought in May 1955. At that time, the great drought that lasted for nine months made all water conservancy projects and drought resistance methods almost equal to "a drop in the bucket." The prefectural committee immediately convened an emergency meeting of the five counties concerned and decided to seal off not only the Han River, but also all the rivers in the entire region. After more than ten days of struggle, not a single drop of water from the rivers in the entire region flowed into the sea, irrigating the cracked fields and saving the dying rice.

Increase measures are popularized widely and quickly

Almost all the representatives from various places who came to visit believed that the Shantou Special Zone has a great characteristic in that it promotes advanced production experiences and production technologies, whether local or foreign, very quickly and universally. For example, Nante No. 16 was introduced from Jiangxi Province, but it was first popularized here. A series of cultivation techniques centered on small clumps and dense planting were not first successfully tested here, but they were first universally promoted here. Being able to do this, in addition to the importance attached by the leaders, is also because there are positions and teams in promoting advanced production technologies.

In the past few years, every county and every district has established and cultivated key townships and key cooperatives for production work, and each county has strived to operate demonstration farms. These have become forward positions for researching and promoting farming techniques. In the past few years, every year, during the slack season, activists and young people from various townships and cooperatives have been absorbed, concentrated for short-term training, summarized production experience, imparted certain agricultural scientific knowledge and new technologies. Now, the entire region has 130,000 such peasant technicians, each township has established a technology promotion station, and each cooperative has established a technology research group, so that the entire region has a huge and dense technology promotion network. Every new production technology experience is first carefully tested and summarized in the high-yielding fields of key townships, cooperatives, farms, or agricultural models, and the principle that it can be universally promoted in this region or can be promoted under certain conditions is determined. In this way, the promotion is not introducing bit by bit, promoting step by step, but adopting observation, evaluation, symposium, training and other methods, and promoting it on a large scale in a guided and organized manner. After cooperation, the plan to promote advanced experience is universally combined with the work of formulating labor quotas for agricultural cooperatives. For example, for small clump dense planting, if it does not meet the specifications, it will not reach the labor quota. Therefore, it can be promoted very quickly and universally, and there is a guarantee for implementation. This approach is both stable and fast, does not fall into spontaneity, and does not produce administrative orders. It can be said that it is a large-scale working method.

Marching towards a thousand-jin special zone

Now, the new determination of the Party and government leading organs in the Shantou area is: "March towards a thousand-jin special zone"! Strive to achieve an average grain yield of 1,000 jin per mu in the entire region by 1962, and 1,150 jin by 1967. All seventeen counties and cities will become "thousand-jin counties" by 1967, and Chaoan and Chenghai counties have also proposed becoming "double thousand-jin counties."

The new combat goal was formulated by the cadres' meetings and activists' meetings in the counties of the entire region based on the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, criticizing the right-leaning ideology of "production reaching the top," and carefully clarifying the potential for increased production. They believe that the potential for increased production in the entire region is still very large. For example, the yields of various places and cooperatives are very unbalanced. For rice alone, many agricultural cooperatives in the Hubei Plain have exceeded 1,000 jin per mu, and the high-yielding fields of the Hongguang, Hongqi, and Yunguang cooperatives have exceeded 2,000 jin, but there are still many places that have not reached 800 jin, and some low-yielding fields are only 200 to 300 jin. The high yield of sweet potatoes is 1,700 jin per mu, and the low yield is only 300 jin. Just making these low-yielding areas and low-yielding fields catch up with the high-yielding areas and high-yielding fields can greatly increase grain production. In addition, high-yield areas can also continue to move forward. (Attached chart)

    我国第一个八百斤专区
    本报记者　黄向青
    并不是风调雨顺
    广东省汕头专区，早在1956年就成为全国第一个亩产八百斤粮食的专区。全区十五个县两个市郊区五百六十四万亩粮食耕地，平均产量八百十一点六斤。
    1955年这个专区的潮安、澄海、潮阳成了粮食千斤县。1956年，又有揭阳、普宁、南澳三县和汕头、潮州两市郊区突破千斤水平。这样，韩江下游约二百万亩耕地的潮汕平原，就成为一个亩产千斤的平原了。
    现在全区晚稻仍未收刈完毕，但胜利消息已陆续传来。各个千斤县已普遍达到高产地区首先要求稳定产量的目的，有些县在稳定中继续提高。其中澄海县比1956年每亩增产二十四斤，比它成为“千斤县”的1955年提高二百四十八斤，以亩产一千二百五十七斤居全国粮食单位面积产量的首位。潮安县平均亩产量达到一千二百三十三斤。今年，其他产量较低的县也紧紧地追赶上来。
    汕头专区为什么在粮食生产上取得这样优异的成就？是否有得天独厚的特殊优越条件呢？这几乎是每一个前来参观的代表团都十分注意的问题。我国中南部十二省水稻参观团的一位团员，曾在潮阳县南门乡进行过一次试验，他从一块亩产一千二百斤以上的田里抓了一把泥土，拿去用水冲洗，泥土冲净以后，手里留下了半把砂粒。土质并不怎样好。
    不但土质并不优良，其他自然条件也不算很好。潮汕平原各县，高地怕旱，低地受涝，沿海沿江台风、咸潮、洪水为患，这里雨量虽多，但是却集中5至7月，其他季节常受旱灾。
    最近几年来，也少有风调雨顺的年景，1953、1954两年秋天就有十级左右的猛台风。以后连年都有灾害。汕头专区就是在这灾害不断的年月里，在农业战线上取得了胜利。
    紧紧抓住关键措施
    汕头地区的党政领导机关很早就认识到：“没有水利建设，就没有农业生产”。1955年冬实现合作化，掀起了一个空前的水利建设运动，地委书记亲自到工地上去指挥、领导施工。对于一些彻底消灭水旱灾害的联县联区的工程，也依靠群众出力，地方、农业社自筹款项，本着“能吃下的坚决吃下”的原则坚决去做。如1956年间完成的引榕（江）灌溉工程，渠道延长达一百八十多公里，一举解决了普宁、潮阳两县四十五万亩的灌溉，消灭了海潮上涌的威胁。全区五百三十一万亩水田，抗旱能力在六十天以上的有三百五十二万亩，约占66％；全区九百十三公里防洪堤，都能保证普通洪水不溃决，四百公里长的海堤，也能抵御十级左右台风海潮的冲击。总之，水利条件的根本改变，是汕头能成为“八百斤专区”的保证。
    开展群众性的积肥运动，是农业生产发展的第二个关键。这个地区，特别是粮食高产的潮汕平原几县的农民，历史上一贯依赖化学肥料，很多地方的农民，从来就没有积肥的习惯。如潮安、揭阳县，过去使用商品肥化学肥占了肥料总量的80％以上，许多耕地变成了
  “日出如火石、雨来似膏药”的状态。在目前无法大量供应化学肥料的情况下，积肥就成为解决肥料缺乏和改良土壤的重要方法。几年来，在党提出的“靠山向山，靠海向海，平原向土”的号召下，采刈绿肥、挖海泥、塘泥、河泥和地下“海泥”，形成了热烈的运动。为了挖肥泥，许多地方车干了小河，车干了几十年未干过的水塘，农民自豪地宣称：“要挖到海龙王的屋角去”。群众也不断找到了许多肥源，如韩江下游沿岸发现和开采隐藏地底下的“海泥”，这种“海泥”含有40％的半腐熟有机质，氮磷钾俱全，打破了“平原无肥可积”的说法。合作化以后，真正实现了“五勤、六有”的积肥方法。（“五勤”是勤拾、勤扫、勤采、勤挖、勤种；“六有”是猪有圈、牛有栏、灰有屋、粪有池、人有厕所、鸡鸭有埘。）许多地方的农民，连洗脚水、尿缸渍、烟囱灰等等一草一屑都收集起来沤肥。
    汕头地区在改进耕作方法提高技术水平方面所做的努力，是全省农民所称赞的。在广东，有人说潮汕地区农民耕田的细致“像绣花一样”。过去这一带的最高产量是五百斤，这是全省最高的产量。几年来的生产运动中，总结出的耕作方法就有：精细整地、培育壮秧、适时插秧、查苗补缺、中耕除草、合理施肥、合理排灌等等。其他地区的一些成功经验和优良谷种，也被引进和推广了。如几年来全区已实现了两个“化”：一是“小科密植化”，一是“早造谷种南特化（南特十六号稻种）”。小科密植的田比老办法增产10％以上。在各种耕作条件相同的情况下，早造采用南特十六号比一般种子多收一百零一斤。最近又新引进了江南一二二四号种子，个别试验测定，比南特种每亩又可增产三十斤。
    归根到底是一个“干”字
    为什么汕头地区能依靠这些措施取得了这么大的成绩呢？记者曾就这问题跟汕头地委第一书记罗天、副书记郑希和其他一些地委委员谈过，他们都说：看来就是一个“干”字吧！这个“干”字表现在：党委一贯重视领导农业生产，一贯强调党委深入生产，亲自抓生产。
    汕头地委无论什么时候，都强调各级党委以第一把手抓生产。当其他任务繁重时，领导上就实行统一安排适当分工，从地委、县委到区委、乡村支部委员和积极分子，都始终分成两套人马，使两方面工作穿插进行，互相推动，一齐做好。突击任务过去后，各级党委都保持70％的力量放在生产上。
    由于党委亲自抓生产工作，决心大、站得高、看得全面，各项生产工作就比单靠一般业务部门去做收效大得多。这一点特别表现在水利工作上面。例如：兴宁县的宁西排灌沟渠工程，需要越山过岭，穿过十二条河流，延长数十公里，使十二万亩田消除水旱灾害，连省水利厅个别负责人也认为困难重重，但在地委支持、县委亲自掌握指挥之下，集中了几十名干部到工地去领导，发动了五万多各乡村群众，在短短的二十天内就开挖成功了。
    值得提起的是1955年5月战胜百年不遇的旱灾奇迹。当时，延续九个月的大旱，使所有水利工程和抗旱办法都几乎等于“杯水车薪”。地委马上召集有关五县的紧急会议，决定了不仅把韩江，而且把全区所有河流封锁起来。十多天的奋斗，就使全区河流一滴水也流不进海，灌溉了龟裂的田土，挽救了垂死的稻禾。
    增产措施普及得又广又快
    几乎所有前来参观的各地代表都认为，汕头专区对于本地的或是外地的先进生产经验、生产技术，推广得很快和很普遍，是一个很大的特点。比如南特十六号是从江西省引进的，却先在这里普及了。以小科密植为中心的一系列栽培技术，不是这里首先试验成功，而却又在这里先普遍推广起来。能够这样，除了因为领导重视以外，还因为在推广先进生产技术上能做到有阵地有队伍。
    几年来，每一个县、每一个区，都建立和培养了生产工作的重点乡、重点社，各县都努力经营示范农场。这些，就成为研究推广耕作技术的前进阵地。几年来，每年都利用农闲吸收各乡、社的积极分子和青年，集中施以短期训练，总结生产经验，传授一定的农业科学知识和新的技术，现在，全区已拥有这种农民技术员十三万名，每一个乡都建立了技术推广站，每一个社都建立了技术研究小组，这样就使全区拥有一个庞大的密布的技术推广网了。每一项新的生产技术经验，都首先在重点乡、社、农场或农业模范的丰产田上进行慎重的试验和总结，确定了可在本区普遍推广或在某种条件下可推广的原则，这样推广起来，就不是一点一点地介绍，一小步一小步地推广，而是采取观摩、评比、座谈、训练等方式，有领导有组织地大规模地推广。在合作化以后，推广先进经验的计划普遍地同农业社制订劳动定额的工作结合起来。例如小科密植插秧，不合规格就算达不到劳动定额。所以，就能很迅速普遍地推广开去并且有贯彻实施的保证。这种做法，是既稳又快，不致陷于自流，又不致产生行政命令，可以说：是一种大规模的工作方法。
    向千斤专区前进
    现在，汕头地区的党政领导机关新的决心是：“向千斤专区前进”！争取在1962年全区粮食产量达到每亩平均一千斤，1967年达到一千一百五十斤，十七个县市在1967年都成为“千斤县”，潮安澄海两县还提出成为“双千斤县”。
    新的战斗目标是经过全区各县干部会议和积极分子会议根据三中全会精神，批判“生产到顶”的右倾思想，认真摸清增产潜力的基础上订出来的。他们认为：全区增产潜力还很大。比如各地各社产量很不平衡，光水稻一项，湖北平原不少农业社已超过亩产千斤，红光、红旗、云光三个社的丰产田超过了二千斤，但却还有许多地方尚未达到八百斤，有一部分低产田才二百至三百斤。番薯产量高的每亩一千七百斤，低的只有三百斤。仅仅使这些低产区、低产田向高产区、高产田看齐，就能使粮食产量大大增加。另外，高产地区也还可以继续前进。（附图表）
