　　How to Choose Toys for Children?
　　Lin Jiashui
　　Playing is a major event for children. During play, children's creativity can be developed, and their flexible movements and careful thinking can be exercised. Therefore, a child's play in his early years has a great relationship with what kind of person he will become when he grows up. Parents should pay attention to their children's play.
　　We often see some little girls keep candy wrappers, bottle caps, scraps of floral cloth, small boxes, etc., to cut out small figures or play house. Some little boys always have bulging pockets filled with pebbles, glass bottles, and small picture cards. Children treat these things as treasures. However, some parents do not care about their children's play, thinking that toys are useless. This view is incorrect. If parents pay attention, they can see that if children do not have toys, they will touch here and rummage there, grabbing things everywhere to use as their toys. Therefore, parents should consider how to provide appropriate toys for their children.
　　When preparing toys for children, you should choose toys that are suitable for the development of children's minds and bodies and can cultivate children's good moral character. For example, dolls are very good toys. Children can use them to play all kinds of games, they can treat the doll as their own child, undress it, and pat it to sleep; they can also let the doll be a car driver and a postal worker delivering letters. Children can use dolls to learn from adults how to care for children and how adults work. This will cultivate children's care for others and love for labor.
　　Parents should also pay attention to choosing toys that make children use their brains. Children who have not yet started school like toys that can change patterns, such as six-sided pictures, pegboards, and building blocks. Especially building blocks, whether they are colored or not, children love them. Because building blocks can be changed into many patterns. For example, if a child wants to build a Tiananmen, he must first think about what Tiananmen looks like and how to build it before he can build it. In this way, children learn to use their brains while playing.
　　We often see on the street those toys that wind up and run automatically. Children like them very much when they first see them, and they are even teased to laugh. However, if children play with this type of toy all day long, just winding it up and watching it run, without requiring children to use their brains, they will get bored after a long time, and they will not gain any benefit. Therefore, it is not advisable to buy too many of these toys.
　　Toys should also be suitable for the child's age. Three- or four-year-old children are active, so give them cars that can be pushed and pulled, balls to run around and pat, or animals they are familiar with. Five- or six-year-old children like toys that make them think more, such as pegboards, airplanes, various puzzles, and ships; they prefer to make toys themselves with some materials, such as nailing a small boat with wooden boards or pasting a small table with boxes.
　　There is another situation when it comes to children's toys. Some parents think that the more toys a child has, the better, so they spend a lot of money and buy a lot of toys for their children. If there are too many toys, children will throw them around casually and not be very interested in any one toy. Buying too many toys for children is not only a waste of money, but also easily cultivates children's habit of not cherishing things.
　　Parents should educate their children to cherish toys and not destroy them casually. If toys are damaged or broken, they should be repaired. If the child does not know how to repair it himself, the parents can help him repair it, and do not throw it away if it is slightly damaged. In addition, organizing children to manage toys in an orderly manner is also very beneficial for cultivating children's independence and interest in labor.
　　If parents can take the time to make some toys for their children, that would be best. On the one hand, it can save money, and on the other hand, it is of great educational significance for children. Children who see with their own eyes the toys made by their parents through their own labor will cherish them more and respect and love their parents even more.

　　怎样给孩子选择玩具？
　　林嘉绥
    玩，对孩子们是一件大事。在玩的时候，可以发展孩子的创造性，锻炼灵活的动作和周密的思想。所以孩子小时候的玩，对他长大以后成为什么样的人有很大的关系。作父母的应该重视孩子的玩。
    我们常常看到，一些小女孩子把包糖的花纸、瓶盖、碎花布、小盒儿什么的都留着，剪小人呀，摆家家呀。一些小男孩子，兜里总是揣得鼓鼓的，石头子儿、玻璃瓶、小画片什么都有。孩子把这些东西当成了宝贝。但是，有些父母不关心孩子的玩，认为玩具没有什么用处。这种看法是不对的。作父母的如果注意一下，就可以看到孩子要是没有玩具，他们就在家里摸摸这里，翻翻那里，到处乱抓东西当他的玩具。所以，做父母的应该考虑到怎样给孩子适当玩具的问题。
    在给孩子准备玩具的时候，要选择适合孩子心身发展，并且能培养孩子良好的道德品质的玩具。例如，娃娃就是很好的玩具。孩子们用它可以做各式各样的游戏，可以把娃娃当成自己的孩子，给它脱衣服，拍它睡觉；还可以让娃娃当汽车司机和送信的邮递员。孩子能用娃娃学大人爱护孩子和大人劳动的样子。这样就能培养孩子关心人和热爱劳动。
    父母还要注意选择使孩子动脑筋的玩具。没上学的孩子喜欢能变花样的玩具，像六面图、插板、积木。尤其是积木，不管有颜色没颜色，孩子都爱。因为积木可以变好些花样。比如，孩子要搭个天安门，他就要先想想天安门是个什么样、该怎样搭法，然后才能搭出来。这样在玩的时候，孩子就学会了用脑子。
    我们常在街上看到卖的那种上了弦就会自动跑的玩具，孩子刚一见到很喜欢，甚至被引逗得哈哈大笑。可是，要是孩子整天玩这类玩具，只是上上弦，看看它怎样跑，用不着孩子动脑筋，时间长了孩子就会腻，也得不到什么益处。所以这种玩具不宜多买。
    玩具也要适合孩子的年龄。三、四岁的孩子好动，给他一些能够推着拉着走的车子，拿着跑跑拍拍的球，或者是他所熟悉的动物。五、六岁的孩子喜欢那些多动脑筋的玩具，像插板、飞机啦，各种拼板、轮船啦；他们更喜欢用一些材料自己做玩具，像用木板钉只小船、用盒子糊个小桌子等。
    对待孩子的玩具，也有另一种情况。有些父母认为，孩子的玩具越多越好，于是花了很多钱，给孩子买了不少的玩具。玩具多了孩子就会随便把玩具乱扔，对哪一种玩具都没多大兴趣。给孩子买过多的玩具，不但浪费钱，而且容易养成孩子不爱护东西的习惯。
    父母应该教育孩子爱惜玩具，不要随便破坏。如果玩具损伤了或者破碎了，应当把它修理好。如果孩子自己不会修，父母可以帮助他修理，千万不要坏一点就扔掉了。此外，组织孩子有条理地管理玩具，这对于培养孩子的独立性和劳动兴趣，也是很有好处的。
    如果父母能抽空给孩子做一些玩具那当然最好不过了。一方面可以节约，另一方面对孩子的教育意义也很大。孩子亲眼看到父母用自己的劳动做出来的玩具，他们就会更爱惜，并且更加尊重和热爱自己的父母。
