　　Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: TASS, Moscow, December 15th: Moscow has published a letter from the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, to the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Drees.
    Bulganin called the attention of the Dutch government to the fact that, at the initiative of the US and British governments, European members of the North Atlantic Alliance were taking new measures to intensify military preparations.
    The letter said that under the guise of so-called "Atlantic solidarity," the US military, which dominates the affairs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, actually wants to deploy US atomic and hydrogen weapons further away from the US's vital centers. This would expose the territories of European countries hosting US atomic bases to atomic retaliation.
    Bulganin pointed out that it is not difficult to imagine the real and dangerous consequences of establishing US bases in a country like the Netherlands. Doing so is very dangerous, especially because a large part of the Netherlands is below sea level.
    The letter drew attention to the fact that the initiators of the new NATO plan do not conceal their hope that this meeting of the organization will achieve a further strengthening of West Germany's military-industrial potential.
    Bulganin stressed that if events develop in this way, it would pose a great danger both to the Dutch people and to other neighboring countries that have twice suffered the terror of German occupation in a short period.
    The letter expressed the hope that the Dutch government would support the peace proposals put forward by the Soviet government.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: TASS, Moscow: The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, wrote a letter to the Prime Minister of Belgium, Van Acker.
    In the letter, Bulganin discussed the issue of NATO member states being equipped with atomic and hydrogen weapons, and the establishment of missile bases with atomic and hydrogen warheads in these countries. He emphasized that if the decision on whether to store atomic and hydrogen weapons in Belgium and whether to use these weapons were to be made by US or German generals, then the Belgian people could not feel safe.
    Bulganin pointed out that the initiators of the new NATO plan expect West Germany's military-industrial potential to be further strengthened. This means intensifying West Germany's militarization and allowing German revanchists to prepare for a new war with impunity. Such a development would pose a great danger to Belgium, which has twice been invaded by German militarism in a short period.
    Bulganin recalled the talks between the government delegations of the Soviet Union and Belgium in 1956. During these talks, the two governments expressed their firm intention to take measures to strengthen mutual trust and believed that efforts must be made to resolve the issue of disarmament. Bulganin said, "I believe that the time has come for the Belgian government to make concrete efforts to fulfill its promises."
    Next, Bulganin discussed the Soviet government's proposal that the major powers declare a halt to all nuclear weapons testing from January 1st of next year and the proposal to establish a zone free of nuclear weapons in Europe. He hoped that the Belgian government would take measures to support these proposals.
    He concluded by expressing his conviction that the Belgian government would study the views he had expressed in the letter and make a decision that would be conducive to consolidating peace and security in Europe and the world.
    Bulganin's letter was delivered to the Belgian Prime Minister on the 11th of this month.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: TASS, Moscow, December 15th: The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, wrote to the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Bech, saying that at the initiative of the US government and the British government, some people in Europe were taking new measures to strengthen military preparations. According to statements by NATO leaders, the NATO Council meeting in Paris was preparing to adopt a resolution on arming NATO member states with atomic and hydrogen weapons and intended to use the scientific achievements of all member states to manufacture the latest nuclear and missile weapons.
    Bulganin's letter was delivered to Luxembourg's Acting Prime Minister Frieden on December 14th.
    In the letter, Bulganin said that using the territories, armed forces, and economic resources of Western European countries, especially small and densely populated countries like Luxembourg, for aggressive purposes would inevitably lead to dire consequences for these countries.
    Bulganin hoped that the Luxembourg government would not further exacerbate the already tense international situation.
    The letter mentioned some suggestions made by the Soviet government with the aim of easing international tensions, and Bulganin hoped that the Luxembourg government would support these suggestions.
    Bulganin pointed out that Luxembourg has pursued a policy of neutrality for decades. Under the current circumstances, taking certain steps conducive to maintaining and consolidating peace in Europe would not only be in the interests of the people of Luxembourg but also in the interests of universal peace.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: TASS, Moscow, December 15th: The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, wrote to the Prime Minister of Iceland, Jónasson, drawing his serious attention to the fact that the NATO meeting in December (of which Iceland is a member) will decide on further intensifying the ways and means of arms expansion, and formulate new plans for the widespread use of nuclear weapons and the deployment of missile weapons.
    In the letter, Bulganin said that the Soviet government believes that in order to safeguard peace and prevent war, all countries must have a clear understanding of the current world situation.
    The letter was delivered to the Icelandic Prime Minister by the Soviet Ambassador to Iceland on the 14th.
    In this letter, Bulganin suggested that the obligation of countries to undertake not to use nuclear weapons and to cease nuclear weapons test explosions from January 1st of next year (even if it is only for two or three years) should be taken as the first step in this regard.
    Bulganin wrote that the Soviet government is ready to support suggestions that might be put forward to guarantee the security of Iceland, for example, the suggestion of neutrality, stipulating that no foreign military bases, including air force bases, should be established on its territory.

　　布尔加宁致函荷比卢冰岛首脑
    指出大西洋集团准备核战争的危险
    要求支持苏联和平建议共同努力巩固欧洲安全
    据新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：莫斯科发表了苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁写给荷兰首相德里斯的一封信。
    布尔加宁提请荷兰政府注意：在美国和英国政府的倡议下，欧洲北大西洋联盟的参加国正在采取新的措施来加紧军事准备。
    信中说，在所谓“大西洋团结”的幌子下支配北大西洋公约组织事务的美国军人，实际上是想把美国的原子武器和氢武器配置在离开美国的生命中心远一些的地方，这样做就会使那些设有美国原子基地的欧洲国家的国土遭受原子回击。
    布尔加宁指出，美国基地设置在像荷兰这样一个国家会带来的真正危险后果是不难想像的。这样做危险很大，特别是因为荷兰有很大一部分领土是低于海面的。
    信中提醒注意这样一个事实：北大西洋公约组织新计划的发起人并不隐瞒他们指望在这个组织的这次会议上能做到进一步加强西德的军事——工业潜力。
    布尔加宁着重说，事件如果这样发展，无论对荷兰人来说，或者是对在短短时期内两度遭到德国占领的恐怖的其他邻国来说，都是很大的危险。
    信中希望荷兰政府支持苏联政府提出的和平建议。
    据新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁写信给比利时首相范阿克。
    布尔加宁在信中谈到了北大西洋公约组织成员国装备原子武器和氢武器的问题，以及在这些国家内建立发射带有原子弹头和氢弹头的火箭基地的问题。他强调指出，如果在比利时境内储存原子武器和氢武器而且使用这些武器的问题将由美国将军或者德国将军来决定，那末，比利时人就不可能感到安全。
    布尔加宁指出，北大西洋公约组织新计划的发起人期望西德的军事工业潜力能够进一步加强。这就是说让西德加紧军国主义化，让德国复仇主义者放手准备新战争，事态这样发展下去，对在短短时期中曾经两次遭到德国军国主义侵略的比利时将有很大危险。
    布尔加宁追述了1956年苏比两国政府代表团的会谈。在这次会谈中，两国政府表示坚决要采取加强互相信任的措施，并且认为必须努力解决裁军问题。布尔加宁说，我认为，比利时政府作出具体努力来履行自己的诺言的时机已经到了。
    接着，布尔加宁谈到了苏联政府提出的有关大国宣布从明年1月1日起停止各种核武器试验的建议以及在欧洲建立没有原子武器的地区的建议。他希望比利时政府能够采取措施，支持这些建议。
    他最后表示确信：比利时政府将会研究他在信中所谈到的看法，并且作出有利于巩固欧洲和世界和平与安全的决定。
    布尔加宁的这封信已经于本月11日交给比利时首相。
    据新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁写信给卢森堡首相伯克说，在美国政府和英国政府的倡议下，欧洲有人在采取加强军事准备的新措施。根据北大西洋公约组织领导人的声明，在巴黎举行的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议准备通过关于用原子武器和氢武器武装北大西洋集团成员国的决议，并且打算利用所有成员国的科学成就来制造最新的核武器和火箭武器。
    布尔加宁的这封信是在12月14日交给卢森堡的代理首相弗里顿的。
    布尔加宁在信中说，利用西欧国家、特别是像卢森堡这样一个人口稠密的小国的领土、武装力量和经济资源来达到侵略目的，将会使这些国家不可避免地遭到惨重的后果。
    布尔加宁希望卢森堡政府不要使本来就紧张的国际紧张局势更加紧张起来。
    信中提到苏联政府提出的旨在缓和国际紧张局势的一些建议，布尔加宁希望卢森堡政府支持这些建议。
    布尔加宁指出，卢森堡几十年来执行着中立政策。在当前的情况下，卢森堡采取某些有利于维护和巩固欧洲和平的步骤，不仅符合卢森堡人民的利益，而且符合普遍和平事业的利益。
    据新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁写信给冰岛总理荣纳逊，提请他严重注意：在北大西洋公约组织（冰岛是它的一个成员国）12月召开的会议上将决定进一步加紧扩张军备的途径和方法，制定广泛使用核武器和配置火箭武器的新计划。
    布尔加宁在信中说，苏联政府认为，为了保障和平和防止战争，各国必须清醒地看待当前的世界局势。
    这封信是苏联驻冰岛大使14日交给冰岛总理的。
    布尔加宁在这封信中建议，把各国承担不使用核武器并且从明年1月1日起停止核武器试验爆炸（那怕是停止两三年也好）的义务，作为这方面的第一个步骤。
    布尔加宁写道，苏联政府准备支持可能提出的保证冰岛安全的建议，例如，规定不在它的领土上建立包括空军基地在内的任何外国军事基地的中立主义的建议。
