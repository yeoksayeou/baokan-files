Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 6th: TASS reported from Moscow on December 5th that Brazilian journalist Martorelli and the representative of Brazilian "Crónica" TV company and São Paulo State United Broadcasting Station, Mr. Fleury, had previously requested the First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, Comrade Khrushchev, to answer some questions regarding international affairs and Soviet-Brazilian relations.

On November 21st, Khrushchev received the Brazilian journalists and answered the questions they were concerned about. The questions and Khrushchev's answers are published as follows:

    The Soviet Union welcomes the normalization of relations with Brazil
    Resuming trade and expanding cultural exchange

Q: What is your opinion on the possibility of restoring diplomatic and trade relations between the Soviet Union and Brazil?

A: I have pointed out more than once that the Soviet Union advocates establishing normal relations with all countries, regardless of their political and social structures. We believe that this is the only correct path to strengthening international peace and friendship.

Between the Soviet Union and Brazil, during the period since their establishment, there have never been any disputes or conflicts. On the contrary, during the period when the Nazi fascist forces threatened peace and the peace-loving people of the world rose up against them, the Soviet and Brazilian people stood in the same camp in the struggle against the common enemy. Therefore, I think the current lack of normal relations between the Soviet Union and Brazil (Brazil is one of the world's largest countries in terms of territory, and its population exceeds that of many European countries) is, in any case, unjustifiable.

Because our two countries have not established diplomatic relations, it is impossible to conduct trade directly. Brazil cannot sell us its export commodities, for which it does not have sufficient markets, and at the same time, it cannot buy industrial products from us, especially the equipment and transportation vehicles it needs but cannot obtain in sufficient quantities from other countries.

Naturally, we welcome any measures to restore diplomatic and trade relations between the Soviet Union and Brazil.

Q: If our two countries restore diplomatic relations, and considering that Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer, will the Soviet Union purchase this commodity from us? In addition, what other products and goods are you willing to purchase from Brazil?
What products and goods can you sell to Brazil? For example, can you sell Brazil equipment for drilling and refining oil?

A: The Soviet Union imports coffee, and consumers in our country are also aware of Brazilian coffee. Under the conditions of mutual trade, the Soviet Union can purchase coffee, cocoa beans, leather raw materials, sugar, cotton, and other Brazilian commodities from Brazil. It is expected that with the development of trade relations between the two countries, the scope of goods exchanged will also expand.

As for what the Soviet Union can export to Brazil, as a highly developed industrial country, as a major exporter of machinery and equipment to many countries, the Soviet Union can certainly sell Brazil all kinds of machinery and equipment it needs, such as oil drilling equipment, oil refining equipment, power equipment, machine tools, road construction machinery, various instruments and apparatus, and transportation vehicles, including oil tankers, automobiles, etc.

The Soviet Union can also provide Brazil with commodities such as petroleum products, concrete, metals, paper, celluloid, dyes, and chemical products.

Q: In your opinion, how can we expand cultural, sports, and other ties between the Soviet Union and Brazil?

A: Of course, first of all, both countries must have the desire to establish and develop these ties. The Soviet Union is ready to do its best to expand scientific, cultural, sports, and other ties with all countries, including Brazil. If relations between the Soviet Union and Brazil can be normalized and diplomatic envoys can be exchanged, it will help expand these ties between the two countries. We will welcome Brazilian cultural, scientific, and sports representatives to visit the Soviet Union, and relevant Soviet representatives will also visit Brazil. Why can't Brazilian university students and experts study at Soviet universities, and Soviet university students and experts study at Brazilian universities? They can exchange experiences in culture, sports, economics, and industry, learn from each other, and cooperate with each other. We believe that the lack of extensive contact between the Soviet and Brazilian people is an abnormal phenomenon. With the normalization of relations between the two countries, it will not be difficult to see that our two peoples respect each other, sympathize with each other, and understand each other.

    If all countries coexist peacefully and compete peacefully
    Humanity will have a long period of peace

Q: Noting that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully, can humanity expect lasting peace?

A: It is extremely difficult to make accurate predictions on the issue of war and peace, especially when agreements have not yet been reached on such paramount international issues as disarmament, the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, and the establishment of security systems in Europe and Asia. It is not impossible that reactionary forces may attempt to provoke wars and trigger new world conflicts. However, this not only will not weaken but will strengthen our deep belief that countries with different political and social systems must implement a policy of peaceful coexistence. The question now is: either atomic war with all its consequences or peaceful coexistence. Precisely because the serious danger of a new world war threatens humanity, a resolute and tenacious struggle is needed to achieve the principle of peaceful coexistence. The forces fighting for peaceful coexistence and for preventing war are growing worldwide. The imperialists, represented by the most aggressive groups, are trying to launch a war. However, they are encountering growing resistance from the people of all countries. Therefore, it can be said that as long as all the people, all good people unite to fight for peace, they have the power to restrain the aggressive groups of Western countries and prevent the possibility of a new war from breaking out.

The prerequisites for realizing the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different political and social systems are: abandoning the "position of strength" policy, not using war as a way to resolve international issues, stopping the "cold war," and stopping the arms race. In other words, it is necessary to eliminate all those factors that contain the danger of a new war. Therefore, if all countries firmly adhere to the principle of peaceful coexistence, that is to say, if mutual understanding and trust are established between countries, if all contentious issues are resolved through negotiation, and if ideological contradictions between the capitalist and socialist systems are resolved through peaceful competition in economic and cultural development, and in meeting the material and spiritual needs of the people, then it can be said with certainty that humanity can have a long period of peace. This is precisely the highest goal that the Soviet state has been striving for in the forty years since its founding.

    There are currently five possible sources of war
    But powerful forces for peace can prevent them

Q: Based on your answer, we would like to ask, in your opinion, where are the most dangerous sources of new wars likely to occur?

A: It is difficult to answer this question. It should be known that among the ruling groups of some countries where the imperialists are still strong, there are still some lunatics who often do not know what they are doing. Such people may provoke new military conflicts in many places. But today the most serious cloud-covered area is the Middle East, but it should be pointed out that thanks to the actions of peace-loving countries, there is light even there, and the clouds are being dispersed. If the people of all countries remain vigilant in the future, they will be able to restrain the aggressive groups' attempts to provoke military conflicts in this region.

In Europe, the possibility of the imperialist aggressor forces launching a new war is not ruled out either. The imperialist groups of some countries are intensifying the revival of German militarism, concentrating their forces to deal with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in Europe. There are also sharp contradictions here. However, in Europe, if we objectively analyze the situation, the pre-war situation like on the eve of the Second World War does not exist.

How things develop in the future depends on many factors, first of all on the vigilance of the people of all countries, and on their struggle to prevent war and to strive for international peace.

The third possible source of war is Korea. Although the Korean War has stopped, there are still large numbers of armed forces stationed there, especially the armed forces of the United States. As everyone knows, North Korea also has corresponding armed forces. We are deeply convinced that North Korea will not take military action, because the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is doing everything possible to prevent war and to achieve national reunification through peaceful means. However, in South Korea, in addition to the U.S. armed forces, there are also large numbers of Syngman Rhee troops, and war cries are constantly emanating from there. There are some irrational people there who may be plotting provocations.

The fourth possible source of war is Taiwan. As everyone knows, the United States occupies Taiwan, the territory of the People's Republic of China, and incites Chiang Kai-shek, who is entrenched there, to carry out provocative actions. But will the People's Republic of China abandon its territory? The U.S. ruling groups disregard the interests of the Chinese people, maintain a state of tension in this region, and strengthen the position of their henchman, Chiang Kai-shek.

We can also talk about Vietnam. Due to the actions of the U.S. ruling groups, the well-known Geneva Accords have been violated. The South Vietnamese government's policy towards North Vietnam has sharpened relations between the two sides, and the issue of national reunification cannot be resolved. Thus, South Vietnam is also a source of war where military action may break out. These are the main locations where there is a danger of military conflict.

Of course, this does not mean that such conflicts cannot occur in other locations, especially since the U.S. aggressive groups are still advocating the "cold war." The peace-loving policies of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the strength of their armed forces, and the struggle of the people of other countries to defend world peace will restrain the imperialists' arrogant policy of launching wars.

There is currently a theory emerging in the West about conducting local or small-scale wars using weapons of mass destruction. The imperialists want to use this method of warfare to suppress national liberation movements and subvert governments that do not suit their wishes. However, it is difficult to imagine that small-scale wars would be localized under current conditions. If such a war were to occur, it would quickly spread into a world war.

    Two satellites have summarized the two systems
    Socialism has won this race

Q: The launch of two artificial Earth satellites by the Soviet Union is undoubtedly a great victory for Soviet science. What benefits can artificial Earth satellites bring to humanity?

A: At present, I am afraid that there is no corner of the earth where residents are not interested in Soviet satellites. This is completely understandable, because the launch of artificial Earth satellites is the latest achievement of science. This is a huge leap in scientific and technological thought, and it is the first practical step in realizing humanity's dream of interstellar travel. The benefits this brings to humanity are undeniable, just as any outstanding scientific discovery is applied for creative purposes rather than for destruction. Our scientists, while observing the operation of satellites, have collected very valuable scientific data, which will help solve a series of major scientific problems for humanity.

Q: In your opinion, what impact does the launch of two artificial Earth satellites by the Soviet Union have on easing international tensions?

A: The launch of artificial Earth satellites is, first of all, of extremely great significance to science, but it cannot be denied that it is also of great significance to our national defense. It should be known that artificial satellites can only be launched on the basis of intercontinental ballistic rockets.

The launch of Soviet artificial satellites has aroused various reactions abroad. First, it has aroused everyone's praise for the achievements of Soviet science and technology, while those who are hostile to our country have expressed alarm and unease about the achievements of our science and technology and demanded the intensification of the arms race. More clear-headed politicians have come to the conclusion that now is the time to end the "position of strength" policy.

In this situation, the Soviet Union's proposals on the issue of disarmament, on the issue of prohibiting the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, in short, our entire set of proposals on the issue of disarmament, should have been actively welcomed by Western countries. It should be known that these proposals put forward realistic and completely feasible measures that would lead to the cessation of the arms race and spare the people of all countries the scourge of the "cold war." However, in Western countries, especially in the United States, due to the Soviet Union's achievements in scientific and technological development, another process is intensifying. The ruling groups that determine American foreign and military policy are focusing on intensifying the arms race. It is no accident that the U.S. Secretary of Commerce recently re-proposed Hitler's old slogan of "More guns, less butter," but this is a kind of hysteria, and if it is not stopped, it will bring fatal consequences to the people, especially to those who suffer from this hysteria.

The launch of artificial Earth satellites is like making a summary of the competition between socialist and capitalist countries. Socialism has won this race. After our workers and peasants seized power and overcame incredible difficulties, they eliminated the original backwardness of Tsarist Russia, established a powerful industrial and mechanized socialist agriculture, and cultivated many intellectual workers and peasants.

Under socialism, cadres who have opened up new paths in science and technology have grown up. Thanks to the efforts of Soviet scientists, engineers, and workers, the Soviet Union was the first to launch artificial satellites. This once again vividly confirms that under the socialist system, the economy, science, and culture develop better and faster, and the creativity of the people is developed in all aspects. But our enemies have been saying for decades that the Soviet state will not get rid of backwardness.

No, we have gotten rid of backwardness and, in a short period of history, have caught up with the most advanced capitalist countries. This means that the Soviet Union's current task—to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in economic terms—will also be completed victoriously. There is no doubt about this.

    On equal and non-political conditions
    The Soviet Union is willing to help Brazil develop its national economy

Q: Brazilian agriculture must be mechanized. Can the Soviet Union supply Brazil with tractors and agricultural machinery?

A: The Soviet Union has rich experience in agricultural mechanization. We are selling tractors and various agricultural machines to other countries, and we can also sell these machines to Brazil.

Q: Can the Soviet Union supply Brazil with equipment for nuclear power plants? If so, can Soviet engineers pass on this work to Brazilian engineers?

A: As everyone knows, the Soviet Union participates in the International Atomic Energy Agency. The task of this agency is to help other countries in the peaceful use of atomic energy, including the training of corresponding cadres. Therefore, the Soviet Union can cooperate with Brazil in this regard through the above-mentioned international organization or directly on the basis of bilateral agreements.

Q: Can the Soviet Union help Brazil develop heavy industry, and in what ways can it help?

A: As long as Brazil makes a request to the Soviet Union, this issue can be considered. The Soviet Union supplies complete sets of equipment to many countries, helping them develop their national industries, and providing technical assistance in the construction of enterprises and the training of local personnel. The supply of industrial equipment and technical assistance can be carried out on a commercial basis, on the basis of equality between the two sides and without any political conditions.

Q: Do you have anything to convey to the Brazilian people?

A: Please tell the Brazilian people that I hope they will achieve victory in their struggle to achieve economic prosperity in Brazil, to further consolidate their national autonomy and national independence, and to strive for peace and friendship among the people of all countries in the world.

    赫鲁晓夫同志对巴西记者指出
    各国人民团结斗争能维护和平
    据新华社6日讯　塔斯社莫斯科5日电：巴西记者马尔托雷利和巴西“记事”电视公司及圣保罗州联合广播电台代表弗勒里前些日子曾经请求苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫答复一些国际方面的问题和苏巴关系问题。
    赫鲁晓夫在11月21日接见了巴西记者，并且答复了他们所关心的这些问题。现将各个问题以及赫鲁晓夫的答复刊载如下：
    苏联欢迎同巴西关系正常化
    恢复贸易往来扩大文化交流
    问：关于恢复苏联和巴西外交关系和贸易关系的可能性问题，您的看法如何？
    答：我已经不止一次地指出过，苏联是主张同所有的国家——不管它们的政治和社会结构如何——建立正常关系的。我们认为，这是一条导致加强国际和平和友谊的唯一正确的道路。
    在苏联和巴西之间，在它们建国以来这段期间里，从没有发生过任何纠纷和冲突。相反地，在纳粹法西斯势力威胁和平、世界爱好自由的人民奋起反对它们的这段时期里，苏联和巴西人民在这场反对共同敌人的斗争中是站在一个阵营里的。因此，我觉得苏联和巴西（就领土而言，巴西是世界的大国之一；就人口而言，它超过了欧洲许多国家）之间现在缺乏正常关系的这种现象无论如何也是说不过去的。
    由于我们两国没有建交，所以不可能直接进行贸易。巴西无法把它没有足够市场的出口商品卖给我们，同时也无法向我们购买工业品，特别是它所需要而又不能从其他国家得到足够数量的装备和运输工具。
    自然，我们欢迎在恢复苏联和巴西之间外交关系和贸易关系方面的任何措施。
    问：如果我们两国恢复邦交，同时考虑到巴西是世界上最大的咖啡产地，苏联是否会向我们购买这种商品呢？此外，你们还愿意向巴西购买什么产品和货物呢？
    你们可以把什么产品和货物卖给巴西？例如，你们能把钻探石油并以及提炼石油方面的装备品卖给巴西吗？
    答：苏联进口咖啡，同时我国的消费者也都知道巴西的咖啡。在相互贸易的条件下苏联可以向巴西购买咖啡、可可豆、皮革原料、糖、棉花以及其他巴西商品。可以预料，随着两国贸易关系的发展，互相交换的商品的范围还会扩大。
    至于说到苏联可以向巴西出口什么，苏联作为一个高度发达的工业国，作为一个向许多国家输出机器和装备的大出口国，当然可以向巴西出售它所需要的各种机器和装备，例如石油钻探设备、提炼石油的装备、电力装备、车床、筑路机器、各种仪器和器械、运输工具，其中包括油槽船、汽车等等。
    苏联还可以向巴西提供石油产品、混凝土、金属、纸、赛璐珞、染料、化学产品等类的商品。
    问：据您看，怎样才能扩大苏联同巴西之间的文化、体育和其他联系？
    答：当然，首先必须两国都具有建立和发展这些联系的愿望。苏联方面准备尽力同一切国家（包括巴西在内）扩大科学、文化、体育和其他联系。如果苏联和巴西之间的关系能够正常化，并且能够互派外交使节，就会有助于扩大两国之间的这些联系。我们将欢迎巴西的文化、科学、体育代表访问苏联，苏联的有关代表也访问巴西。为什么不能让巴西的大学生和专家到苏联的高等学校以及苏联的大学生和专家到巴西的高等学校求学呢？他们可以互相交流文化、体育、经济和工业方面的经验，互相学习，互相合作。我们认为，苏联和巴西人民之间缺乏广泛的接触是不正常的现象。随着两国关系的正常化就会不难看出，我们两国人民是互相尊重，互相同情和互相谅解的。
    如果各国和平共处和平竞赛
    人类将有一个长久和平时期
    问：注意到社会制度不同的各国有可能和平共处，人类是否能指望有持久和平呢？
    答：在战争与和平的问题上作准确的预测是极端困难的，特别是在像裁军、禁止大规模毁灭性武器以及在欧亚两洲建立安全体系等这样一些头等重要的国际问题上还没有达成协定的情况下。反动势力可能企图挑起战争，掀起新的世界冲突，这种可能性不是没有的。但是这不仅不会削弱而且反而会加强我们的这样一种深切的信念：政治和社会制度不同的国家必须执行和平共处的政策。现在的问题是：或者是带有一切后果的原子战争、或者是和平共处。正是因为新的世界大战的严重危险威胁着人类，所以需要进行坚决顽强的斗争来争取实现和平共处的原则。为和平共处、为防止战争而奋斗的力量在全世界范围内日益增长。以侵略性最大的集团为代表的帝国主义者力图发动战争。但是，他们遭到各国人民日益增长的反抗。因此，可以说，只要全体人民，一切善良的人们团结起来争取和平，他们是有力量约制西方国家侵略集团，并且防止爆发新战争的可能性。
    实现政治和社会制度不同的国家和平共处的原则的先决条件是：放弃“实力地位”政策、不把战争当作解决国际问题的方法、停止“冷战”和停止扩充军备，换句话说，就是要消除一切蕴藏新战争危险的那些因素。因此，如果各国都坚决遵循和平共处原则，也就是说，如果各国间建立起相互谅解和信任关系，如果一切争执问题都将通过谈判方式求得解决，而资本主义体系和社会主义体系之间意识形态的矛盾通过在经济和文化发展方面、在满足人民物质需求和精神需求方面的和平竞赛方式而加以解决，那么可以确信地说，人类将可以有一个长久的和平时期。这正是苏维埃国家建国四十年来所全力以赴的最高目标。
    现有五个可能的战争策源地
    但是强大和平力量能予制止
    问：根据您的答复，我们想问一下，您认为可能发生新战争的最危险的策源地在什么地方？
    答：很难回答这个问题，要知道，在帝国主义者还强大的一些国家的统治集团当中，还有一种疯人，他们常常不知自己所干的是什么。这种人可能在许多地方挑起新的军事冲突。但是今天乌云密布最严重的地方是中近东，不过应当指出，由于爱好和平国家的行动，就是在那里也出现了光明，乌云正在被驱散。如果各国人民今后仍保持警惕，他们能够制止侵略集团想在这一地区挑起军事冲突的企图。
    在欧洲，帝国主义侵略势力发动新战争的可能性也不是没有的。一些国家的帝国主义集团正在加紧复活德国军国主义，集中力量来对付苏联和欧洲其他社会主义国家。这里也存在尖锐的矛盾症结。但是，在欧洲，如果客观地分析一下局势，那么，像第二次世界大战前夜的那种战争前夕的局面是不存在的。
    今后事态怎样发展，这取决于许多情况，首先取决于各国人民的警惕，取决于他们为防止战争、争取国际和平而进行的斗争。
    第三个可能的战争策源地是朝鲜。虽然朝鲜战争已经停止，但是那里仍旧存在着大批的武装部队，特别是美国的武装部队。大家知道，北朝鲜也存在着相应的武装部队。我们深信，北朝鲜是不会采取军事行动的，因为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在尽一切努力来防止战争，来通过和平的道路实现国家统一。然而，在南朝鲜，那里除了美国武装部队，还有大批李承晚军队，并且从那里不停地发出战争的叫嚣。那里有一些可能蓄谋挑衅的丧失理智的人。
    第四个可能的战争策源地是台湾。大家知道，美国占领了中华人民共和国领土台湾，并且怂恿盘据在那里的蒋介石进行挑衅行动。但是难道中华人民共和国会放弃自己的领土吗？美国统治集团毫不考虑到中国人民的利益，维持这一地区的紧张状态，并且加强其走卒蒋介石的阵地。
    我们还可以谈谈越南，由于美国统治集团的行动，众所周知的日内瓦协议的履行遭到破坏。南越政府对北越采取的政策，使得双方的关系尖锐化，国家统一问题不能解决，这样，南越也是可能爆发军事行动的战争策源地。这就是有发生军事冲突危险的几个主要地点。
    当然，这并不是说在其他地点不可能发生这种冲突，特别是美国侵略集团方面还在鼓吹“冷战”。苏联和其他社会主义国家的爱好和平的政策，它们武装力量的强大，其他国家人民保卫世界和平的斗争会制止帝国主义者狂妄的发动战争的政策。
    目前西方出现了一种所谓用大规模毁灭性武器进行局部战争或者小型战争的理论。帝国主义者想通过这种战争方式来镇压民族解放运动，颠覆不合他们心愿的政府。然而很难想像，在目前条件下的小型战争会是局部性的。如果发生这种战争，就会迅速蔓延为世界大战。
      两颗卫星已总结了两种制度
    是社会主义赢得了这场竞赛
    问：苏联发射两颗人造地球卫星无疑是苏联科学的巨大胜利。人造地球卫星可以给人类带来什么好处呢？
    答：目前，恐怕地球上没有一个角落的居民不对苏联卫星感到兴趣。这是完全可以理解的，因为人造地球卫星的发射是科学的最新成就。这是科学技术思想方面的一个巨大跃进，这是实现人类星际旅行幻想的第一个实际步骤。由此而给人类带来的益处是无可置疑的，正如任何一种卓越的科学发现应用于创造的目的而不是用于破坏的情况一样。我们的科学家在观察卫星运行的同时，收集了非常宝贵的科学资料，这些资料有助于解决人类一系列重大的科学问题。
    问：您认为，苏联发射两颗人造地球卫星对缓和国际紧张局势有什么影响？
    答：人造地球卫星的发射，首先对科学具有极其重大的意义，但是不能否认，它对我国国防也具有重大意义。要知道，只有在洲际弹道火箭基础上才能够发射人造卫星。
    苏联人造卫星的发射，在外国引起各种不同的反应，首先，它引起大家对苏联科学技术成就的赞扬，而那些敌视我国的人对我国的科学技术成就则表示惊惶不安，并且要求加紧扩充军备。头脑比较清醒的政治家们作出这样的结论：现在是结束“实力地位”政策的时候了。
    在这种情况下，苏联就裁军问题、禁止使用原子武器和氢武器问题所提出的建议，总之，我们就裁军问题所提出的整套建议，本来是应当受到西方国家的积极欢迎的。要知道，这些建议提出了导致停止扩充军备、使各国人民免去“冷战”祸害的、现实的、完全切实可行的措施。但是，在西方国家，特别是在美国，由于苏联在科学技术发展方面的成就，却正在加紧另一种过程。那些决定美国外交政策和军事政策的统治集团着重加紧扩充军备。美国商务部长不久以前重新提出了希特勒的“多些大炮，少些牛油”这个陈旧的口号，这并不是偶然的，但是，这是一种歇斯底里，如果不加以制止，它就会给人们，首先是给那些患这种歇斯底里病的人带来致命的后果。
    人造地球卫星的发射好比是对社会主义国家和资本主义国家之间的竞赛作出了总结。社会主义赢得了这场竞赛。我国工人和农民掌握政权并克服了难以置信的重重困难后，消除了沙皇俄国原有的落后现象，建立了强大的工业、机械化的社会主义农业，培养出了许多工农知识分子。
    在社会主义条件下，在科学技术方面开辟新道路的干部成长起来了。由于苏联科学家、工程师和工人们的努力，苏联第一个发射了人造卫星。这再一次鲜明地证实了在社会主义制度下，经济、科学、文化发展得更好更快，人民在各方面的创造性得到了发展。可是我们的敌人几十年来硬说苏维埃国家是不会摆脱落后的。
    不，我们摆脱了落后，并且在历史上的一个短时期内赶过了最先进的资本主义国家。这意味着，苏联当前的任务——在经济方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家——也会胜利地完成。这是无可怀疑的。
    在平等和不附带政治条件下
      苏联愿助巴西发展民族经济
    问：巴西的农业必须机械化。苏联能不能供给巴西拖拉机和农业机器呢？
    答：苏联在农业机械化方面有着丰富的经验。我们正在把拖拉机和各种农业机器卖给其他国家，我们也可以把这些机器卖给巴西。
    问：苏联能不能供给巴西原子能发电站的装备？如果能够的话，那么苏联工程师能否把这方面的工作传授给巴西工程师？
    答：大家知道，苏联参加了国际原子能机构。这个机构的任务就是在和平利用原子能方面帮助其他国家，其中也包括培养相应的干部。因此苏联在这方面可以通过上述国际机构或者直接在双方协定的基础上同巴西进行合作。
    问：苏联能否帮助巴西发展重工业，可以用什么方式帮助呢？
    答：只要巴西向苏联提出要求，这个问题是可以考虑的。苏联供应许多国家整套装备，帮助它们发展民族工业，在建设企业和训练当地人员方面给予技术援助。供应工业装备和技术援助可以在商业的基础上进行，在双方平等、不附带任何政治条件的基础上进行。
    问：您有什么话要我们转达给巴西人民吗？
    答：请转告巴西人民，我希望他们在争取巴西经济繁荣，争取进一步巩固他们的民族自主和国家独立，争取世界各国人民的和平和友谊的斗争中取得胜利。　（文内小插题是本报编者加的）
