Xinhua News Agency, Tongchuan, December 3rd: The largest new-type coal mine pair in the Northwest—the Wangshiwa vertical shafts in the Tongchuan mining area—began construction on the 2nd. This is the fourth pair of coal mines newly built in the Tongchuan mining area during the First Five-Year Plan period.

　　The Wangshiwa vertical shafts are large coal mines designed with the help of the Soviet Union. Its mining equipment is more advanced than other newly built coal mines. Underground coal mining and transportation will be done by combined coal mining machines, chain conveyors, belt conveyor corridors, and electric trains.

　　Fang Zhongru, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, called on the mine construction workers at the groundbreaking ceremony of the Wangshiwa vertical shafts to complete the construction task of the coal mine ahead of schedule with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains.

　　西北兴建一个大煤井
    据新华社铜川3日电西北最大的一对新型煤井——铜川矿区王石凹竖井2日开工兴建。这是第一个五年计划期间在铜川矿区新建的第四对煤井。
    王石凹竖井是苏联帮助我国设计的大型煤井。它的开采设备比其他新建的煤井都先进，井下采煤和运煤工作都由联合采煤机、链板运输机、皮带运输走廊和电气列车来做。
    中共陕西省委书记方仲如在王石凹竖井开工典礼上，号召建井职工用愚公移山的精神，提前完成煤井建设任务。
