Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 20th. Where should cadres be transferred? How should they be transferred? What should be done after the transfer? The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has carefully studied and meticulously arranged these questions based on the specific conditions of Jiangxi Province.

Approximately 50,000 to 60,000 cadres in Jiangxi Province need to be transferred to the labor front for training. The Provincial Committee first studied how to closely integrate this cadre transfer with the development of agricultural production throughout the province. Jiangxi is a province with many mountains and little land. Mountainous areas account for approximately 150 million mu, or about 60% of the province's total area. Furthermore, the mountainous areas of Jiangxi are basically old revolutionary base areas from the Second Domestic Revolutionary War. In these vast mountainous areas, the climate is warm, rainfall is abundant, the soil is fertile, and natural resources are rich, with great potential for development. However, due to the severe devastation caused by the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, the population in the mountainous areas of Jiangxi is currently small, and the recovery and development of the mountainous economy has been quite slow. The output value of forestry and local specialties in the mountainous areas currently only accounts for about 11% of the province's total agricultural output value, and the abundant resources of the mountainous areas urgently need to be developed. In addition, among the more than 20 million mu of water surface in the province, there are more than 200 diked lakes and natural lakes that can be used for fish farming but have not yet been utilized. Based on this natural situation and the current economic development situation, and in accordance with the central government's instructions on comprehensively developing mountainous areas, the Provincial Committee believes that, for a considerable period in the future, the province should continue to focus on developing agriculture. In developing agriculture, it is necessary to vigorously develop the mountainous economy and water resources, while implementing the principle of focusing on grain and cotton production, in order to prosper the national economy and support national construction. The central issue in developing mountainous areas is to mobilize and organize a large number of laborers to go to the mountains. This time, mobilizing a large number of excellent cadres to go to the mountains can, on the one hand, help the people who currently live in the mountainous areas to settle down and produce in the mountains with peace of mind. On the other hand, it can also drive the masses to go to the mountains, increase the population in the mountainous areas, and solve the problem of insufficient labor force in the mountainous areas. Therefore, the Provincial Committee clearly determined that the main direction for cadre transfer is to go to the mountains, followed by going to the water.

How to go to the mountains? The Provincial Committee believes that, based on the situation in Jiangxi, the best way is to establish state-owned comprehensive forestry, animal husbandry, and agricultural reclamation farms. This is because, first, concentrating a large number of cadres in reclamation farms facilitates leadership and the training of these cadres. Second, comprehensive reclamation farms are like comprehensive universities, where transferred cadres can learn various production skills and knowledge for advancing towards nature. Third, because reclamation farms are comprehensive and production is diverse, it is easy to make reasonable labor arrangements based on each cadre's different circumstances and strengths. Fourth, reclamation farms are responsible for guiding and managing the production of nearby agricultural and forestry production cooperatives, so that transferred cadres have the opportunity to integrate with the peasants, learn from them, understand their thoughts and feelings, and transform themselves. In addition, establishing state-owned reclamation farms is an important link in the comprehensive development of mountainous areas. State-owned comprehensive forestry, animal husbandry, and agricultural reclamation farms are socialist bases for the comprehensive development of mountainous areas and the core force for building mountainous areas. However, the number of state-owned forest farms or farms in the province is currently too small, with only 2.5 million mu of forest land under their management. It is necessary to greatly develop them.

After carefully studying these situations and problems, the Provincial Committee believes that establishing state-owned comprehensive forestry, animal husbandry, and agricultural reclamation farms in the mountainous areas not only arranges the best path for transferred cadres but also creates favorable conditions for the comprehensive development and construction of mountainous areas. The two are closely integrated. Based on this analysis, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee decided to immediately prepare for the establishment of one hundred state-owned comprehensive forestry, animal husbandry, and agricultural reclamation farms throughout the province. Among them, the province will establish thirteen, arranging for the transferred cadres of provincial-level organs; one administrative region and five special districts will each establish one, arranging for the transferred cadres of administrative region and special district organs; all eighty-two counties in the province, except for Nanchang County, which does not have mountainous areas and will not establish one, will each establish one, arranging for the transferred cadres of county-level organs.

The Provincial Committee stipulates that state-owned reclamation farms should both engage in diverse production themselves, developing various mountain economies, and guide and manage the production of surrounding agricultural and forestry production cooperatives. Cadres transferred to state-owned reclamation farms are both production teams, engaging in arduous labor to develop and build mountainous areas, and work teams, organizing and mobilizing the masses, and guiding and helping the surrounding peasants politically, culturally, and in production. The Provincial Committee requires the more than 50,000 cadres transferred to these one hundred reclamation farms this year to manage 3.5 million mu of forest land by the end of 1958, and to connect and guide the collectively owned mountain forests of agricultural cooperatives, reaching about 10 million mu. Taking these one hundred reclamation farms as the position, making leap forward progress year by year, by 1962, the province is required to establish one thousand socialist forestry bases—state-owned comprehensive forestry, animal husbandry, and agricultural reclamation farms, with a managed area reaching 15 million to 20 million mu. These bases will serve as the backbone force for the comprehensive development and construction of mountainous areas, and through these bases, gradually guide and manage the mountain forests of the entire province.

After the Provincial Committee made such specific plans and arrangements for the issue of how to transfer cadres, the Provincial Party Secretary and dozens of senior cadres led advance teams to the mountainous areas to conduct site surveys and planning for farm construction, and to make various preparations for a large number of cadres to go to the mountains. At the same time, special districts and counties also dispatched advance teams to prepare for going to the mountains.

On December 14, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee convened a joint meeting of heads of various departments to jointly listen to reports from personnel returning from the advance teams. At this meeting, the issue of how cadres should begin their work and production after going to the mountains, as well as some of the difficult problems they initially raised, were studied, specific solutions and plans were proposed, and various departments were instructed to provide strong support.

Currently, the first batch of more than 50,000 cadres in Jiangxi Province who are being transferred to the mountains has already set off successively. When mobilizing this group of cadres to go to the mountains, party and government leading organs at all levels carried out meticulous ideological education work on them, repeatedly explaining the significance of cadre transfer and mountain area development, so that they left very happily. The Provincial Committee believes that it is particularly important to continue to work on the cadres after they go to the mountains, and they must never be left unattended or have their leadership relaxed. In order to solve this problem, in addition to assigning strong leading cadres to each reclamation farm to carry out regular work, the Provincial Committee also decided that the province's thirteen reclamation farms would be directly led by the Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, the administrative region and special district reclamation farms would be directly led by the party and government leading departments of the administrative regions and special districts, and the county reclamation farms would be directly led by the county committees and county people's committees.

The Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee believe that going to the water is also a good way to train and exercise cadres. Therefore, they recently issued instructions requiring party and government organs at all levels to immediately investigate the water surface situation and propose plans for utilizing and establishing fish farms next year. The Provincial Committee has decided to transfer a portion of cadres to engage in the work of establishing state-owned fish farms.

The Provincial Committee has also made arrangements for transferring a portion of cadres to strengthen the cultural and educational front and enrich the grassroots organizations of various cultural and educational units.

The Provincial Committee believes that cadre transfer is a new and complex task. Although these arrangements have now been made and some of the initial problems have been solved, many new problems will inevitably arise after the cadres are transferred. Therefore, the Provincial Committee requires party and government leading organs at all levels to adopt a spirit of being responsible to the end, take concrete measures, and constantly care for and help the transferred cadres, understand their work, labor, thoughts, and living conditions and problems in all aspects, and earnestly help them solve them.

### 下放干部要和发展生产结合起来  江西省筹建百个垦殖场  五万干部陆续上山

    下放干部要和发展生产结合起来
    江西省筹建百个垦殖场  五万干部陆续上山
    新华社南昌20日电  干部下放到哪里？如何下放？下放以后怎么办？对于这些问题，中共江西省委根据江西省的具体情况，进行了仔细的研究、细致的安排。
    江西省约有五万到六万干部需要下放到劳动战线去锻炼。省委首先研究了怎样使这次干部下放同发展全省的农业生产紧密结合起来的问题。江西是个山多地少的省份，山地面积约有一亿五千万亩，占全省总面积的60％左右；并且江西的山区基本上都是第二次国内革命战争时期的老根据地。在广大的山区里，又是气候温暖、雨量充沛、土地肥沃、物产丰富，发展生产的潜力很大。但是，由于过去国民党反动派的严重摧残，目前江西山区的人口很少，山区经济的恢复发展相当缓慢，山区林业及土特产的产值，目前仅占全省农业总产值的11％左右，山区的丰富资源亟待开发。此外，在全省两千多万亩水面中，有可以用来养鱼的两百多个围堤内湖和自然湖目前还没有加以利用。根据这种自然情况和目前经济发展情况，并根据中央全面开发山区的指示，省委认为，在今后相当长的时期内，全省仍应以发展农业为重点，而在发展农业的问题上，又必须在贯彻执行以发展粮棉生产为中心的前提下，大力开发山区经济和水面资源，以繁荣国民经济，支援国家建设。开发山区最中心的问题就是要动员和组织大批的劳动力上山。这次动员大批优秀干部上山，一方面可以帮助现在住在山区的人民安心在山区生产，一方面又可以带动广大群众上山，增加山区人口，解决山区劳动力不足的困难。因此，省委明确地确定，下放干部的主要方向是上山，其次是下水。
    如何上山？省委认为，根据江西的情况，最好的办法是建立国营林牧农综合垦殖场。这是因为，第一，把众多的干部集中地下放到垦殖场内，便于领导，便于这些干部的培养和锻炼；第二，综合垦殖场就是一所综合大学，下放干部可以在这里学到向自然进军的多种生产技能和知识；第三，由于垦殖场是综合性的，生产是多样的，因此便于根据每个干部的不同情况和特长进行合理的劳动安排；第四，垦殖场负有指导和管理附近农林业生产合作社生产的责任，这样，下放干部便有机会同农民打成一片，向农民学习，体会他们的思想感情，以改造自己。除此以外，建立国营垦殖场又是全面开发山区的一个重要环节。国营林牧农垦殖场是全面开发山区的社会主义基地，是建设山区的核心力量；但是现在全省的国营林场或农场数量太少，其经营的林地面积只有二百五十万亩，有必要大加发展。
    省委细致地研究了这些情况和问题以后认为，在山区建立国营林牧农综合垦殖场，不仅为下放干部安排了最好的出路，而且为全面开发和建设山区创造了有利条件。两者是紧密结合的。基于这种分析，省委和省人民委员会决定，立即在全省筹建一百个国营林牧农综合垦殖场，其中：省建立十三个，安排省级机关的下放干部；一个行政区和五个专区各建立一个，安排行政区和专区机关的下放干部；全省八十二个县除南昌县没有山区不建立以外，一律各建立一个，安排县级机关的下放干部。
    省委规定，国营垦殖场一面要自己进行多种生产，开发山区多种经济；一面要指导和管理周围农林业生产合作社的生产。下放到国营垦殖场的干部，一方面是生产队，自己动手进行开发和建设山区的艰苦劳动；一方面是工作队，组织和发动群众，从政治上、文化上、生产上指导和帮助周围的农民。省委要求今年下放到这一百个垦殖场的五万多干部，到1958年底，经营林地面积达到三百五十万亩，联系和指导农业社集体所有山林面积达到一千万亩左右。以这一百个垦殖场为阵地，逐年跃进，到1962年，要求全省建立社会主义林业基地——国营林牧农综合垦殖场一千个，经营面积达到一千五百万到二千万亩。以这些基地作为全面开发和建设山区的骨干力量，通过这些基地，逐步把全省的山林指导和管理起来。
    省委对干部如何下放的问题作了这样的具体规划和安排以后，就由省委书记和几十名高级干部分别率领先遣队开往山区，进行建场的勘测规划，及大批干部上山的各项准备工作；同时，各专区、县也派出了先遣队，进行上山的准备工作。
    12月14日，省委和省人民委员会召开了各部门负责人的联席会议，共同听取从先遣队回来的人员的汇报。在这个会议上，对于干部上山后如何开始他们的工作和生产的问题，以及他们初步提出来的一些困难问题进行了研究，提出了具体的解决办法和方案，并责成各部门大力支援。
    目前，江西省首批下放上山的五万多名干部，已经陆续出发。在动员这批干部上山时，各级党政领导机关对他们进行了细致的思想教育工作，反复说明了干部下放和开发山区的意义，使他们走得很愉快。省委认为，干部上山后，继续对他们进行工作尤其重要，绝不可推出门不管，放松对他们的领导。为了解决这个问题，省委除在每个垦殖场配备了较强的领导干部进行经常工作以外，还确定省的十三个垦殖场由省委和省人民委员会直接领导，行政区和专区的垦殖场由行政区和专区的党政领导部门直接领导，县的垦殖场由县委和县人民委员会直接领导。
    省委和省人民委员会认为下水也是培养和锻炼干部的好办法，因此最近发出指示，要求各级党政机关立即动手摸清水面情况，提出明年利用和设立养鱼场的计划。省委确定要下放一部分干部去从事建立国营养鱼场的工作。
    对于下放一部分干部加强文教战线，充实各文教单位的基层组织的问题，省委也作了安排。
    省委认为，下放干部是一件新的复杂的工作，现在虽然做了这些安排，初步碰到的问题也已解决了一些，但是干部下放后定会出现许多新的问题。因此，省委要求各级党政领导机关必须以负责到底的精神，采取具体措施，经常关心和帮助下放干部，了解他们的工作、劳动、思想和生活等各方面的情况和问题，切实帮助他们解决。
