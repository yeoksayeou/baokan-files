Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 26th: The New Year is fast approaching. Moscow is already displaying a festive and joyous atmosphere. The entrances and display windows of various stores have also been decorated for the holiday. Unlike previous years, many stores this year are using artificial earth satellites and rocket models instead of the usual fir branches and Father Frost, reflecting the pride Muscovites feel in the great achievements of their motherland's science and technology. In all the city's stores and over a hundred New Year markets, joyous crowds are coming and going, selecting New Year goods and buying fir trees.

The food stores are particularly crowded. This year, the supply of meat, dairy products, and fruits is very plentiful. Housewives do not need to queue for long to buy fresh meat, large quantities of tangerines, and apples. There are also many kinds of cheese this year, which is a direct result of the Soviet people's efforts in developing agriculture and increasing the production of meat, milk, and butter this year.

The largest children's store in the country, "Children's World," is decorated like a fairyland, with fir branches everywhere. Thousands upon thousands of parents are bringing their children here to choose clothes and toys. Currently, more than 200,000 toys are sold here every day.

The Kremlin, the Hall of Columns of the Trade Union Building, the Luzhniki Sports Palace, as well as all the city's clubs and cultural palaces, are undergoing final decorations before the New Year celebrations. These places will be hosting young guests respectively.

This year, Moscow has built more than 400,000 square meters of new housing than last year. In the Southwest District, Mazhaisk District, and May First District, hundreds of households who have just moved into new homes are making final arrangements for their new houses: hanging curtains, installing lampshades, and placing potted flowers on sunny windowsills, preparing to welcome the first dawn of the New Year in their new homes.

Encouraged by the two declarations, Muscovites are bidding farewell to 1957 with pride and a sense of self-respect, and are preparing to win new great achievements in the New Year with the same heroic spirit.

    莫斯科人喜气洋溢迎新年
    据新华社莫斯科26日电  新的一年即将来到人间。莫斯科已经呈现出了一片过年时的热闹欢乐的景象。各个商店的入口和橱窗也都作了节日装扮。和往年不同的是：今年不少商店用人造地球卫星和火箭模型代替了通常用的枞树枝和严寒老人，这表示出莫斯科人们对祖国科学技术伟大成就感到的骄傲。在全城所有的商店和一百多个新年市场里，喜气洋溢的人群来来往往挑选年货和购买枞树。
    食品商店里的顾客特别多。今年肉类、奶制品以及水果的供应十分充足，主妇们不需要排很长的队就可以买到新鲜的肉类、大量的橘柑、苹果。今年奶酪的种类也很多，这是苏联人民今年发展农业、增产肉类、牛奶和黄油的最直接的结果。
    全国最大的儿童商店“儿童世界”布置的好像洞天仙境，到处都插上了枞树枝。成千成万的父母带着孩子们来这里选购服装和玩具。现在，这里每天出售的玩具就有二十多万件。
    克里姆林宫、工会大厦圆柱大厅、卢日尼基运动宫以及全城各俱乐部、文化宫都在进行年节前的最后装饰。在这些地方将分别接待小客人们。
    今年莫斯科比去年多建了四十多万平方公尺的新住宅。在西南区、马扎伊斯克区、五一区，成百户刚刚迁入新居的居民正对新房作最后的布置：系上窗帘、挂上灯罩、把盆花摆在向阳的窗台上，准备在新房里迎接新春的第一个黎明。
    受两个宣言鼓舞的莫斯科人正怀着骄傲、自豪的心情送走1957年，并且怀着同样豪迈的心情准备在新的一年里赢得新的伟大成就。
