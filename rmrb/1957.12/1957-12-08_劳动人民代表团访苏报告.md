Report on the Visit to the Soviet Union by the Labor People's Delegation
Liu Ningyi, Head of the Chinese Labor People's Delegation
(I)
At the joint invitation of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Women's Committee, and the Soviet Peace Committee, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, the All-China Women's Federation, and the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace decided to organize a Chinese Labor People's Delegation to go to the Soviet Union to participate in the grand celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution and to visit. The delegation consisted of thirty-six people, including representatives from all fields, six of whom were glorious participants in the October Revolution and the Soviet Civil War.

The Chinese Labor People's Delegation flew to the Soviet Union on November 4 and returned to Beijing from the Soviet Union on the 28th. We participated in the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution and the meeting of the working people of Moscow to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, and visited the parade and mass procession in Red Square celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution. We visited factories, collective farms, state farms, universities, middle schools, memorial halls, museums, art galleries, and many other cultural and educational institutions in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev. We visited the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Women's Committee, the Soviet Peace Committee, and other organizations, and had friendly meetings with many Soviet workers, farmers, people in science, literature, and art, as well as Soviet veteran comrades who participated in the October Revolution and the Civil War. In Leningrad and Kiev, the delegation also participated in friendship gatherings of local worker activists together with other foreign labor people's delegations.

In these extensive activities, the delegation expressed to the Soviet working people from all walks of life the warm congratulations of the Chinese working people from all walks of life on the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the determination to strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation, and expressed on behalf of the Chinese people our heartfelt gratitude to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Government, and the Soviet people for their consistent support to our country. The delegation has now successfully completed the glorious task entrusted to it by the working people of the motherland. We would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude once again to our Soviet hosts who warmly received the Chinese Labor People's Delegation, as well as to all the Soviet brothers and sisters we came into contact with during our visit.

(II)
Although we only stayed in the great Soviet land for twenty-four days this time, the impressions we gained were extremely profound and will never be erased. We are particularly pleased to see that the great Soviet people, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have overcome all difficulties and built the Soviet Union into a world-class power. Our great ally, the Soviet Union, is a great socialist country with a powerful modern industry and modern agriculture, a high level of culture and science, and unparalleled power in national defense. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people are victoriously transitioning to the greatest ideal of mankind—a communist society—in order to realize the glorious tasks put forward by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

We visited the construction of the world's first nuclear-powered icebreaker in the Soviet Union, visited the metal factory that manufactures extra-large turbines for the huge hydro-electric power stations in Kuibyshev and Stalingrad, and visited the machine tool factory that produces the latest automatic lathes... These visits allowed us to see concretely that the Soviet Union has built a first-class socialist industry.

We also saw in the Soviet Union that Soviet agriculture has made great developments and progress in recent years. The collective farms and state farms we visited, like all collective farms and state farms in the Soviet Union, have further increased their degree of mechanization, greatly increasing the sown area and yield per unit area. Soviet farmers are now striving to catch up with and surpass the United States in the production of meat, milk, and fats per capita in the next few years in order to realize the party's great call.

We also saw that Soviet science, education, culture, and art have been highly developed and have already surpassed the United States in major scientific and technological fields. The Soviet Union has successfully launched two artificial earth satellites, and we were very happy to see the "backup" of the first artificial satellite with our own eyes. The Soviet Union has long eliminated illiteracy, and is now beginning to transition to the implementation of universal ten-year secondary education for young people. The Timido瓦列宁 collective farm we visited in Ukraine has a ten-year middle school. We also saw with our own eyes that whether in fine arts, music, dance, or other arts, the cultural and artistic undertakings of all Soviet nationalities have greatly developed.

In the military parade in Red Square, we also saw with our own eyes the majestic and well-organized Soviet armed forces and the various latest weapons they possess, including rocket weapons. Everything displayed in the Red Square parade shows that in order to ensure national defense and defend peace, democracy, and socialism, the Soviet Union has armed forces that are superior to those of first-class capitalist countries. With such a powerful armed force, not only is the socialist and communist construction of the Soviet people reliably guaranteed, but also the peaceful construction of other socialist countries and the cause of the vast masses of people around the world striving for peace, democracy, and socialism are given the strongest support.

In their contact with us, the Soviet people used many concrete facts to prove that their ability to achieve such great achievements is inseparable from the leadership of the Party, the superiority of the socialist system, the unity of the entire people, and the concerted efforts of all nationalities. The fact is exactly this: it is precisely because the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union are firmly united and resolutely follow the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union that they can overcome all difficulties on the road forward and move from one victory to another. The Soviet people have used unremitting efforts to prove to the world the absolute superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, making the socialist system truly attractive to the hearts of progressive people all over the world. For us, the extremely brilliant achievements of Soviet socialist construction have further strengthened our confidence in building socialism, and have further proved the complete bankruptcy of the anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-socialist fallacies of our country's bourgeois rightists. We believe that as long as the people of our country are united and resolutely follow the Communist Party on the road of socialism, we can certainly build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science in the next ten to fifteen years. We see that the Soviet people are striving to catch up with or surpass the United States in the output of the most important products of Soviet industry and agriculture in fifteen years. The Chinese people should also strive to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in the output of steel and other heavy industrial products during the same period. In this way, the socialist world will leave the imperialist countries far behind.

In order to successfully realize this glorious task, the Chinese people particularly need to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the spirit of hard work and thrift in building the country. Everything we saw in the Soviet Union made us understand more clearly that our country's construction is still very backward. The Soviet Union's socialist construction has already made great achievements, and its advanced experience and advanced science and technology are what we must learn. Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is our unswerving policy and an indispensable aspect of our country's socialist construction. At the same time, we visited many places in the Soviet Union this time, and we all saw that the Soviet people, from top to bottom, are doing everything with a spirit of diligence, simplicity, and thrift. Every Soviet person is proud to participate in labor. This glorious socialist labor attitude and heroic struggle spirit of the Soviet people are exactly what the Chinese people need in their socialist construction, and they are also what the Chinese people should earnestly learn and implement in all their work.

(III)
When we arrived in the Soviet Union this time, it was when the world situation had entered a new turning point that was beneficial to socialism. We deeply felt in the Soviet Union that the great unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and the great internationalist unity of the working people of all countries are invincible in the world.

A total of sixty-four communist and workers' party representatives, as well as labor people's representatives and other delegations from a wider range of countries, participated in the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union this time. Representatives of communist and workers' parties from all over the world, representatives of working people from all countries in the world, and many peace-loving people gathered in Moscow, fully demonstrating the great unity of the working people of the world, the socialist countries of the world, and the peace-loving forces of the world, and also the most powerful demonstration to the imperialist aggressive bloc. This great unity is in stark contrast to the increasing expansion and intensification of contradictions within the imperialist camp.

We were happy to hear in the Soviet Union that from November 14 to 19, the representatives of the communist and workers' parties of the twelve socialist countries who came to Moscow to participate in the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, as well as the representatives of all sixty-four communist and workers' parties, held two meetings separately and unanimously adopted two declarations. Now, the Communist Party not only holds power in the Soviet Union, but also in a series of other countries, leading socialist construction, and has become a powerful and broad mass political force in some capitalist countries. Therefore, the successful holding of these two meetings and the publication of the two great revolutionary declarations are events of great significance in the current world politics and also events of great significance in the history of the international communist movement. We believe that the working people and peace-loving people all over the world who are striving for liberation will gain unlimited confidence and courage from these two meetings and the declarations they have adopted.

(IV)
The delegation lived in the most friendly atmosphere in the Soviet Union at all times, and at all times felt the great strength of the great, fraternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

Wherever we were in the Soviet Union, whether at celebrations or friendship gatherings, whether in factories or farms, even on flying routes and train carriages, we saw the Soviet people's warm and sincere respect and love for the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao Zedong. The Soviet brothers and sisters also expressed an extremely warm welcome to the delegation. We understand that this is because we are representatives sent by the Chinese working people. All the glory given to us by the Soviet people should belong to the great Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao Zedong.

We also saw with our own eyes the huge assistance given by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Government, and the Soviet people to our country's socialist construction. In many schools and factories in the Soviet Union, there are our country's students or interns who have studied or are studying there. Soviet comrades have taught us their valuable experience accumulated over the past forty years without reservation. In many factories in the Soviet Union, machines are being built for our country's factories. Soviet worker brothers have made "completing the Chinese brothers' orders ahead of schedule" and "delivering the best quality products to China" a part of the labor competition for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Many Soviet comrades told us that the Soviet people believe that the relationship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is closer than that of real brothers. They have and will continue to vigorously support our country and help our country build socialism ahead of schedule.

The delegation also represented the people of our country in the Soviet Union, warmly congratulating the Soviet people on the great festival of the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution and the great achievements of the Soviet people's socialist construction over the past forty years. We fully expressed the Chinese people's internationalist feelings for the Great October Revolution and the Great Soviet Union, fully expressed the Chinese people's heartfelt gratitude to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Government, and the Soviet people for their assistance to our country, fully expressed the Chinese people's sincere desire to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and fully expressed the Chinese people's determination to resolutely strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation and consolidate the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. We deeply understand that Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation have extremely great effects on the common prosperity of China and the Soviet Union, on the consolidation and development of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and on the cause of world peace and human progress. Continuously strengthening Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation is the Chinese people's highest internationalist obligation. As Chairman Mao Zedong said when he arrived in Moscow this time: "The October Revolution enabled the Chinese people to find the road to complete liberation and prosperity. The Chinese people have received great sympathy and generous assistance from the Soviet people in their own cause. The people of our two countries have formed a fraternal alliance in the common struggle. No force in the world can separate us. ...We will always stand together and fight for world peace and the victory of our common cause."

The Soviet brothers and sisters also entrusted the delegation to convey their respect to the working people from all walks of life in China and congratulate us on making further achievements in socialist construction. We now respectfully convey this fraternal greeting and wish from the Soviet comrades to the working people from all walks of life in China. Let us be more modest and prudent, work hard, study hard, and strive to carry the socialist revolution through to the end, striving for the complete victory of socialism over capitalism on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, and at the same time, continue to promote socialist construction in a planned and comprehensive manner, and gradually realize national industrialization and agricultural modernization. Let us, together with the great Soviet people, together with the working people all over the world and all peace-loving people, advance towards greater victories!

    劳动人民代表团访苏报告
    中国劳动人民代表团团长　刘宁一
    （一）
    应全苏工会中央理事会、苏联对外文化协会、苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会、苏联妇女委员会和苏联保卫和平委员会的联合邀请，中华全国总工会、中苏友好协会总会、中国共产主义青年团中央委员会、中华人民共和国妇女联合会和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会等有关人民团体，决定组织中国劳动人民代表团，赴苏联参加庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年盛典和参观访问。代表团共有三十六人，包括各方面代表性人士，其中有六位是光荣的十月革命和苏联国内战争的参加者。
    中国劳动人民代表团在11月4日乘飞机赴苏，28日从苏联回到北京。我们参加了苏联最高苏维埃庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年的大会和莫斯科劳动人民代表庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年的大会，并且在红场参观了庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年的阅兵式和群众游行。我们在莫斯科、列宁格勒和基辅等地参观了工厂、集体农庄、国营农场、大中学校、纪念馆、博物馆、美术馆以及其他许多文化教育机关。我们访问了苏中友好协会、全苏工会中央理事会、苏联对外文化协会、苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会、苏联妇女委员会、苏联保卫和平委员会以及其他的一些团体，并且同许多苏联工人，农民，科学、文学、艺术界人士以及参加过十月革命和国内战争的苏联老同志们进行了友好的会见。代表团在列宁格勒、基辅两地，还同其他外国劳动人民代表团一起，参加了当地工人积极分子的友谊集会。
    在这些广泛的活动中，代表团向苏联各界劳动人民表达了我国各界劳动人民对于伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的热烈祝贺和加强中苏友好合作的决心，并且代表我国人民向一贯支援我国的苏联共产党、苏联政府和苏联人民表示了衷心的感谢。代表团现在已经圆满地完成了祖国劳动人民交给的光荣任务。我们愿借此机会，向热情地接待中国劳动人民代表团的苏联的主人们以及我们参观访问中所接触到的所有苏联兄弟姐妹们，再一次地表示我们的衷心谢意。
            （二）
    我们这次在伟大的苏联的土地上虽然只逗留了二十四天，但是所获得的印象却是极其深刻的，永远不可磨灭的。我们特别高兴地看到：伟大的苏联人民在光荣的苏联共产党领导之下，战胜了一切困难，已经把苏联建设成为一个世界头等强国。我们伟大的盟邦苏联，是一个具有强大的现代化工业和现代化农业，具有高度文化科学水平，并且在国防上具有无比威力的伟大社会主义国家。现在，苏联人民正在苏联共产党领导之下，为着实现苏共第二十次代表大会所提出的光荣任务，胜利地向着人类最伟大的理想——共产主义社会逐步过渡。
    我们在苏联参观了世界上第一艘原子破冰船的建造情况，参观了为古比雪夫、斯大林格勒巨大发电站制造特大涡轮机的金属工厂，参观了生产最新式自动车床的机床工厂……。这些参观，使我们具体地看到：苏联已经建成了头等的社会主义工业。
    我们在苏联也看到，苏联的农业近年来获得了很大的发展和进步。我们参观的集体农庄和国营农场，同苏联所有的集体农庄和国营农场一样，它们的机械化程度有了进一步的提高，大大增加了播种面积和单位面积产量。苏联农民现在正在为着实现党的伟大号召，争取最近几年内在按人口平均计算的肉类、牛奶和油脂生产方面赶上并超过美国。
    我们还看到苏联的科学、教育、文化艺术事业有了高度的发展，并且已经在重大的科学技术领域内超过了美国。苏联已经顺利发射了两颗人造地球卫星，我们十分高兴地亲眼见到了第一颗人造卫星的“备号”。苏联早已全部消灭文盲，现在正开始过渡到对青年实施普遍的十年制中等教育，我们在乌克兰所参观的季米多瓦列宁集体农庄就设有十年制中学。我们也亲眼看到，不论在美术、音乐、舞蹈和其他艺术方面，苏联各民族的文化艺术事业都有了很大的发展。
    我们在红场的阅兵式中，还亲眼看到雄壮整齐的苏联武装部队以及他们所具有的各种最新式的武器，包括火箭武器。红场阅兵式中所显示的一切，说明为了保证国防和捍卫和平、民主、社会主义事业，苏联具有比头等资本主义国家还要优越的武装力量。有了这样一支强大的武装力量，不但苏联人民的社会主义和共产主义的建设事业获得了可靠的保障，而且其他社会主义国家的和平建设事业和全世界广大人民群众争取和平、民主和社会主义的事业，也获得了最强有力的支持。
    苏联人民在同我们接触中，曾经用了许多具体事实来证明，他们所以能获得如此伟大的成就，是同党的领导，是同社会主义制度的优越性，是同全体人民的团结和各民族的团结一致努力分不开的。事实也正是这样，正是因为苏联各民族人民坚固地团结在一起，坚决地跟着伟大的苏联共产党前进，才能战胜前进路途上的一切困难，从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。苏联人民用坚持不懈的努力向全世界证明了社会主义制度对于资本主义制度的绝对优越性，使得社会主义制度真正吸引了全世界进步人类的心。对于我们来说，苏联社会主义建设的极其辉煌的成就，更进一步加强了我们建设社会主义的信心，也更加证明了我国资产阶级右派反苏、反共、反社会主义谬论的彻底破产。我们相信：只要我国人民团结一致，坚决跟着共产党沿着社会主义道路前进，也一定能够在今后十年到十五年之内，把我国建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。我们看到：苏联人民正在争取在十五年后使苏联工农业的最重要产品的产量赶上或超过美国。我们中国人民也应当争取在同一时期内，在钢铁和其他重工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国。这样，社会主义世界就将把帝国主义国家远远地抛在后面。
    为了胜利地实现这一光荣的任务，我国人民特别需要学习苏联的先进经验和苏联人民艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的精神。我们在苏联看到的一切，使我们更清楚地懂得我国的建设事业还很落后。苏联的社会主义建设事业已经取得了巨大的成就，它的先进经验和先进科学技术是我们必须学习的。学习苏联先进经验，是我们坚定不移的方针，是我国社会主义建设工作中不可缺少的一个方面。同时，我们这次在苏联参观访问了许多地方，都看到苏联人民自上到下地以勤劳、朴素、节约的精神办一切事业。每个苏联人民都以参加劳动自豪。苏联人民这种光荣的社会主义的劳动态度和英勇奋斗的精神，正是我国人民在自己的社会主义建设事业中所必需的，也是我国人民应当认真学习、贯彻到各项工作中去的。
            （三）
    我们这次到苏联的时候，正当世界形势进入了一个有利于社会主义的新的转折点的时候。我们在苏联深刻地感到，以苏联为首的社会主义各国大团结以及各国劳动人民伟大国际主义团结的力量是无敌于天下的。
    这一次赴苏联参加庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年盛典的共有六十四个共产党和工人党的代表，以及更为广泛的国家里的劳动人民代表和其他多种代表团。全世界共产党、工人党的代表，全世界各国劳动人民的代表，以及许多爱好和平的人士齐集莫斯科，充分显示了全世界劳动人民、全世界社会主义国家以及全世界爱好和平力量的伟大团结，也是对于帝国主义侵略集团的最有力的示威。这种伟大的团结，同帝国主义阵营内部矛盾日益扩大化和尖锐化，恰恰成了显明的对比。
    我们在苏联高兴地听到：在11月14日到19日，到莫斯科参加庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年的十二个社会主义国家的共产党和工人党的代表们，以及所有六十四个共产党和工人党的代表们，分别举行了两次会议，分别地一致通过了两项宣言。现在，共产党不但在苏联一国，而且已经在其他一系列的国家中掌握了政权，领导着社会主义的建设，并且在若干资本主义国家中，成为强大的广泛群众性的政治力量。因此，这两次会议的胜利举行和两项伟大的革命宣言的发表，乃是当前世界政治中一个具有伟大意义的事件，也是国际共产主义运动史上一个具有伟大意义的事件。我们相信：全世界各国争取解放的劳动人民和爱好和平的人民，都将从这两个会议和它们所通过的宣言中，获得无限的信心和勇气。
            （四）
    代表团在苏联时时刻刻生活在最友好的气氛中，时时刻刻感到中苏两国伟大的、兄弟般的友谊的巨大力量。
    我们在苏联的任何地方，不论是在庆祝盛典或友谊集会上，不论是在工厂和农庄中，甚至是在飞行的航路上和火车的车厢里，都看到苏联人民对于中国人民、中国共产党和毛泽东主席的热忱的和真挚的尊重和敬爱。苏联的兄弟姊妹们也向代表团表示了极其热烈的欢迎，我们了解这是由于我们是中国劳动人民派出的代表，苏联人民给予我们的一切光荣，应当属于伟大的中国人民、中国共产党和毛泽东主席。
    我们还亲眼看到苏联共产党、苏联政府以及苏联人民对于我国社会主义建设事业所作的巨大援助。在苏联的许多学校和工厂里，都有我国的留学生或实习生在那里学习过或正在学习着，苏联同志把他们四十年来积累的宝贵经验，毫无保留地教给了我们。在苏联的许多工厂里，正在为我国工厂建造机器，苏联的工人兄弟把“提前完成中国兄弟的订货”和“以最好质量的产品交给中国”作为十月革命四十周年劳动竞赛的一项内容。许多苏联同志对我们说：苏联人民认为中苏两国人民的关系比亲兄弟还要亲密。他们已经并将继续大力支援我国，帮助我国提前建成社会主义。
    代表团在苏联各地，也代表我国人民，向苏联人民热烈祝贺十月社会主义革命四十周年的伟大节日和苏联人民四十年来社会主义建设的伟大成就。我们充分表达了中国人民对于伟大十月革命和伟大苏联的国际主义感情，充分表达了中国人民对于苏联共产党、苏联政府和苏联人民援助我国的衷心谢意，充分表达了中国人民努力学习苏联先进经验的真诚愿望，充分表达了中国人民坚决加强中苏友好合作和巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的决心。我们深深地懂得：中苏友好合作对于中苏两国的共同繁荣，对于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的巩固和发展，对于世界和平和人类进步事业，都具有极其巨大的作用。不断地加强中苏友好合作，乃是中国人民最高的国际主义的义务。正如毛泽东主席这次到达莫斯科时所说：“十月革命使中国人民找到了彻底解放和繁荣富强的道路。中国人民在自己的事业中得到苏联人民巨大的同情和慷慨的援助。我们两国人民已经在共同的斗争中结成了兄弟般的同盟。世界上没有任何力量可以把我们分开。……我们将永远站在一起，为着世界和平和我们共同事业的胜利而奋斗。”
    苏联的兄弟姊妹们还委托代表团向全中国各界劳动人民转达他们的敬意，并祝贺我们在社会主义建设中获得进一步的成就。我们现在谨将苏联同志们的这种兄弟的问候和祝望转达给全中国各界劳动人民。让我们更加谦虚谨慎，努力工作，努力学习，努力把社会主义革命进行到底，争取经济、政治、思想各个战线上社会主义对资本主义的彻底胜利，同时，继续有计划地全面地推进社会主义建设，逐步实现国家工业化和农业现代化。让我们同伟大的苏联人民一起，同全世界劳动人民以及一切爱好和平的人民一起，向着更大的胜利前进！
