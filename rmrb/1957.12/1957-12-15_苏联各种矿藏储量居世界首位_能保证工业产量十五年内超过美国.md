Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 14th. Soviet Minister of Geology and Mineral Resources Protection, Antropov, recently published an article in "Pravda" stating that the Soviet Union possesses sufficient mineral resources to guarantee that the Soviet Union will catch up with and surpass the largest capitalist country, the United States, in the total output of the most important industrial products within the next fifteen years.

Antropov pointed out that the Soviet Union currently possesses a first-class mineral base. Of the many mineral deposits that have been proven worldwide, the Soviet Union accounts for a large proportion. Currently, the Soviet Union's proven iron ore reserves account for 41% of the world's total proven iron ore reserves, manganese ore accounts for 88%, potash salts account for 54%, phosphate rock accounts for nearly one-third, peat accounts for 60%, and coal reserves account for 57% of the world's total geological coal reserves. In addition, a large portion of the world's proven oil resources are also concentrated in the Soviet Union.

In terms of proven reserves of minerals such as iron, manganese, coal, copper, lead, zinc, nickel, bauxite, tungsten, mercury, mica, and potash salts, the Soviet Union ranks first in the world. The Soviet Union also ranks among the world's leaders in oil reserves. It can be considered that the Soviet Union's existing mineral resources can already meet the needs of the rapid growth of the national economy.

Antropov cited the rapid increase in reserves of the most important minerals such as coal, oil, natural gas, and iron ore to illustrate the Soviet Union's great achievements in prospecting for mineral resources and the Soviet Union's strong potential for developing industrial production.

He said that before the October Revolution, Russia's proven coal reserves were only 230 billion tons, but now, the geological reserves of Soviet coal mines have reached 867 billion tons. The coal reserves in the Pechora coal basin, discovered in the early days after the establishment of the Soviet regime, now amount to 260 billion tons. During the Soviet era, the Karaganda coal basin, which is much larger than the Pechora coal basin, was also explored, with reserves of over 1.2 trillion tons in the Kansk-Achinsk coal basin, 1.5 trillion tons in the Tunguska coal basin, and trillions of tons in the Lena coal basin. The scope of the original old coalfields such as Donbass, Kuzbass, and Moscow coalfields has also been greatly expanded. In terms of existing coal reserves, the production capacity of coal mining enterprises in Donbass and Kuzbass can be doubled again.

The minister said that the Soviet Union's oil and natural gas resources have also increased significantly. The Soviet Union has discovered many oil and natural gas fields with abundant reserves in Central Asia, Kazakhstan, the North Caucasus, Sakhalin, Ukraine, and especially the Ural-Volga region. More than one hundred oil fields have been discovered in the Ural-Volga region alone, of which sixty-eight have already been exploited. The production of natural gas will increase twelve to fourteen times in the next fifteen years.

Antropov went on to say that the Soviet Union's iron ore reserves have now increased from 2 billion tons before the revolution to more than 35 billion tons, an increase of more than tenfold. Huge iron ore deposits have been discovered in all important industrial areas of the country, among which the iron ore in the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly area, the iron ore in the Kustanai region of Kazakhstan, and the Kolpashevo iron ore in Western Siberia are particularly noteworthy. It is estimated that the reserves of the Kolpashevo iron ore may reach tens of billions of tons. Together with the Gornaya Shoria iron ore and the Altai iron ore in Kuznetsk (both in Siberia), it will be able to fully guarantee the needs of the vigorous development of the steel industry in Siberia in the future.

Antropov then pointed out that the Soviet Union is currently continuing to vigorously carry out mineral exploration work in order to establish mineral resources sufficient for the national economy to use for forty to fifty years in a short period of time. The main tasks at present and in the future are to prospect for all the resources needed by the new huge iron and steel industrial center in the eastern region, and to discover and establish mineral bases in the areas of the Angara River, Yenisei River, and Amur River hydropower projects, so as to develop power-consuming industries there. In addition, it is also necessary to prospect for rare metals, radioactive elements, oil, and natural gas resources throughout the country, especially in the eastern region.

　　苏联各种矿藏储量居世界首位
    能保证工业产量十五年内超过美国
    新华社莫斯科14日电　苏联地质和矿藏保护部部长安特罗波夫最近在“真理报”发表文章说，苏联拥有一切足够的矿藏资源，来保证苏联在最近十五年内在最重要的工业产品的总产量方面赶上和超过最大的资本主义国家——美国。
    安特罗波夫指出，目前苏联拥有头等的矿产基地。在全世界已经探明的许多矿藏中，苏联都占很大的比重。现在，苏联已经探明的铁矿储量占全世界已经探明的铁矿总储量的41％，锰矿占88％，钾盐占54％，磷酸盐原料占将近三分之一，泥炭占60％，煤矿储量占全世界煤矿的地质总储量的57％。此外，在全世界已经探明的石油资源中，也有很大一部分集中在苏联。
    就已经探明的铁、锰、煤、铜、铅、锌、镍、铝土、钨、汞、云母和钾盐等矿产的储量来说，苏联都占世界第一位。在石油储量方面，苏联也位于世界的前列。可以认为，苏联现有的一切矿产资源已经能够满足国民经济迅速增长的需要。
    安特罗波夫举出了煤、石油、天然煤气、铁矿这样一些最重要的矿藏储量迅速增加的情况，来说明苏联在勘查矿藏资源方面所取得的巨大成就，以及苏联发展工业生产的雄厚潜力。
    他说，十月革命以前，俄国探明的煤矿储量只有两千三百亿吨，而现在，苏联煤矿的地质储量达到了八万六千七百亿吨；单是在苏维埃政权建立后初期发现的彼乔拉煤区的煤矿储量现在就有两千六百亿吨。在苏维埃政权年代中，还勘查出了比彼乔拉煤区大得多的卡拉干达煤区，储量达一万二千亿吨以上的坎斯克——阿契斯克煤区，储量达一万五千亿吨的通古斯煤区，以及储量在几万亿吨的勒拿煤区。原有的老煤区如顿巴斯、库兹巴斯和莫斯科煤区的范围也大大扩大了。就现有的煤矿储备来说，顿巴斯和库兹巴斯的采煤企业的生产能力还可以再扩大一倍。
    这位部长说，苏联的石油和天然煤气资源也大大增加了。苏联已经在中亚细亚、哈萨克、北高加索、库页岛、乌克兰、特别是乌拉尔—伏尔加河流域，发现了许多储量丰富的油田和天然煤气，单是在乌拉尔—伏尔加河流域地区发现的油田就有一百个以上，其中已经开采的有六十八个。天然煤气的开采量在最近十五年内将增加十二倍到十四倍。
    安特罗波夫又说，苏联的铁矿储量现在已经由革命前的二十亿吨增加到三百五十亿吨以上，即增加了十多倍。在全国所有的重要工业区都发现了巨大的铁矿藏，其中特别值得注意的是库尔斯克地磁异常区的铁矿，以及哈萨克的库兹坦奈州铁矿、西西伯利亚的科尔帕谢沃铁矿。据估计，科尔帕谢沃铁矿的储量可能达到几百亿吨，它同戈尔纳雅—绍里雅铁矿和库兹?茨克的阿尔塔乌铁矿（都在西伯利亚）一起，将能够充分保证将来在西伯利亚大力发展钢铁工业的需要。
    安特罗波夫接着指出，苏联目前仍继续大力进行矿藏的勘查工作，以便在短时期内建立足够国民经济用四十年到五十年的矿产资源。目前和今后的主要任务是在东部地区为新的巨大钢铁工业中心勘查出它们所需要的一切资源，并且在安加拉河、叶尼塞河和阿穆尔河的电力工程建设地区发现和建立矿产基地，以便在那里发展耗费电力大的工业。此外，还要在全国各地特别是东部地区勘查稀有金属、放射性元素、石油和天然煤气资源。
