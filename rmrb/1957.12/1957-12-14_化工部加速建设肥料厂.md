The Ministry of Chemical Industry Accelerates Construction of Fertilizer Plants

(Our report) The Ministry of Chemical Industry has gained preliminary experience in implementing the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results during the First Five-Year Plan. The person in charge of this ministry was full of confidence and determination yesterday when talking to reporters about how to further implement this policy.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Chemical Industry told reporters that from 1952 to 1957, the total output value of the Ministry of Chemical Industry increased by an average of 30% per year; 1956 saw the fastest growth, 43% higher than in 1955. The Great Leap Forward in 1956 played a significant role in overfulfilling the tasks set by the First Five-Year Plan. In various specific construction projects, due to the correct guidance of the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results, there were also great achievements. The three major chemical plants in Jilin all completed their construction tasks ahead of schedule. The Jilin Fertilizer Plant was originally planned to be built in three years, but it was completed in just two and a half years. After inspection by the State Acceptance Committee and Soviet experts, the quality of the projects was also very good.

In terms of accelerating the construction progress and ensuring the quality of the projects, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has initially accumulated some experience. Several experiences in the construction of the three major chemical plants in Jilin are: civil construction and installation were carried out simultaneously; in a large number of comprehensive construction projects, the work pace of both Party A and Party B, and the "big two-package" (大二包) system were unified, a general headquarters was organized, a comprehensive progress plan was arranged, and comprehensive construction was organized.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Chemical Industry said: As long as the past advanced experience is well utilized, it is expected that the construction time of the Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant will be shortened by half a year compared with the Jilin Fertilizer Plant, and the Taiyuan Fertilizer Plant can be built in only one and a half or twenty months. There are also many savings in construction investment. Now, building the Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant, which is the same size as the Jilin Fertilizer Plant, can save 20%-25% in investment. In order to prevent the occurrence of neglecting quality and waste during construction, the Ministry of Chemical Industry organized four working groups in October to conduct inspections in East China, North China, Northwest China, and Northeast China respectively. The problems found during the inspection are being dealt with.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Chemical Industry said: The speed of construction of a factory is of great significance. One ton of ammonium nitrate (fertilizer) can increase grain production by six tons. A factory with an annual output of 120,000 tons of ammonium nitrate can increase the country's grain production by 720,000 tons a year, enough for 3.6 million people to eat for a year. If a fertilizer plant of this scale is put into production one month earlier, the fertilizer it produces can increase the country's grain production by 12 million yuan in value. One day earlier can increase wealth by 400,000 yuan, and one hour earlier can increase wealth by nearly 20,000 yuan. Therefore, we must resolutely implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results in the future.

　　化工部加速建设肥料厂
    本报讯　第一个五年计划期间，化学工业部在执行多快好省的建设方针方面取得了初步经验。这个部的负责人昨天在同记者谈论如何进一步贯彻这一方针的时候，充满了信心和决心。
    化工部这位负责人对记者说，从1952年到1957年，化工部的生产总值平均每年增长30％；1956年增长最快，比1955年增长了43％。1956年的大跃进，对超额完成第一个五年计划规定的任务起了重大的作用。在各项具体建设工程中，由于有多快好省方针的正确指导，成绩也很大。吉林三大化工厂都提前完成了建设任务，吉林肥料厂原计划建设三年，结果只用两年半的时间就建成了。经国家验收委员会和苏联专家检查，工程质量也都很好。
    在加速施工进度和保证工程质量方面，化工部初步积累了一些经验。吉林三大化工厂建设中的几项经验是：土木建筑和安装交叉施工；在大量综合施工中，统一甲乙方、大二包的工作步调，组织总指挥部，安排综合进度计划，组织综合施工。
    化学工业部的负责人说：只要很好地利用过去的先进经验，预计兰州肥料厂的施工时间将比吉林肥料厂缩短半年，太原肥料厂只要一年半或二十个月就可以建成。在建设投资方面也有不少节省，现在建设和吉林肥料厂规模相同的兰州肥料厂，投资就可以节省20％—25％。为了防止施工中发生忽视质量和浪费的现象，10月份化工部组织了四个工作组，分别到华东、华北、西北、东北进行了检查。检查中发现的问题，正在处理。
    化工部负责人说：一个工厂建设得快慢，有很重要的意义。一吨硝氨（肥料）就可以增产六吨粮食，一个年产十二万吨硝氨的工厂，一年可以使国家增产七十二万吨粮食，够三百六十万人吃一年。这样规模的肥料厂如果提前一个月投入生产，它增产的肥料就可以为国家增产价值一千二百万元的粮食，提前一天可以增产四十万元的财富，提前一个钟头就可以增加近两万元的财富。因此，我们今后一定要切实贯彻多快好省的方针。
