    Continue Efforts to Promote Putonghua
    *People's Daily* Commentator

    It has been more than two years since the National Language Reform Conference in October 1955 resolved to promote Putonghua (Standard Mandarin Chinese). Over the past two years, more than 600,000 primary and secondary school Chinese language teachers have received Putonghua training; most primary schools and some secondary schools and normal schools have begun teaching in Putonghua; and millions of people in the military, government agencies, organizations, and society have also learned Putonghua through radio broadcasts or short-term training courses. The number of people who can speak Putonghua has greatly increased compared to before liberation. However, these achievements are still far from meeting the needs of our country's socialist construction for Putonghua. Take Beijing for example: in the past eight years, the population has increased from more than two million to more than four million. There are still many people in schools, factories, and government agencies who cannot use Putonghua well. In some newly established secondary schools, teachers who come from dialect areas and cannot teach well in Putonghua account for half of the faculty. Across the country, industrial construction is advancing by leaps and bounds, transportation is becoming more frequent, workers, technicians, teachers, and others are being transferred and used uniformly, and the number of demobilized soldiers and students who go from cities to the countryside to participate in agricultural production is increasing, making language barriers an obstacle to life and work.

    It is essential to promote Putonghua so that people have a common language as a tool for expressing and exchanging ideas. This is primarily beneficial to the further consolidation and strengthening of our country. The gradual achievement of complete unification of the Chinese language will free the more than 500 million Chinese-speaking people from the obstacles of dialectal differences and language barriers, and unite them more closely. For ethnic minority brothers, learning Putonghua is also more useful than learning a specific dialect when they need to learn Chinese for work or study. Secondly, the increasingly large-scale socialist construction urgently requires people to be able to speak a unified and standardized language. Politics, economics, national defense, and cultural education cannot advance smoothly in a situation of language differences and confusion. For Chinese itself to develop more perfectly and precisely, and for Chinese characters to be reformed into a phonetic script, it is also necessary to promote Putonghua to prepare favorable conditions. Although the promotion of Putonghua has achieved certain results, our work still lags behind the development of the objective situation. In the past two years, the promotion of Putonghua has not been carried out evenly. In 1956, there was a surge in learning Putonghua, but now it has cooled down somewhat, and in some areas it has even stagnated. Why is this happening? Mainly because there is insufficient understanding of the importance of promoting Putonghua, and not enough attention has been paid to it, so appropriate arrangements have not been made in specific work.

    In the editorial "Strive to Promote Putonghua" published in this newspaper on February 12 last year, it was pointed out that "Whether the task of promoting Putonghua can be completed quickly and effectively nationwide depends on whether Party and government organizations at all levels and all relevant departments fully value this work, and whether they can make comprehensive and specific plans for the work that should be done in their respective regions and departments, and strengthen leadership and supervision." Two years of experience have proven that this statement is still applicable today. Provinces and cities where the leadership attaches importance, where the education department (bureau) has a special organization or personnel in charge, and is willing to expend effort to promote Putonghua, can achieve considerable results even if the dialects are relatively complex. For example, in Zhejiang Province, because the Party and government leadership attaches relatively great importance, the Provincial Putonghua Promotion Work Committee has held several meetings to discuss and arrange work, the Education Department has run Putonghua training classes, compiled textbooks, and regularly sent people to inspect the promotion work in various counties and cities, thus promoting the active promotion work in all counties and cities throughout the province. Last summer vacation, with the exception of one disaster-stricken county, all counties and cities in the province held primary school teacher phonetics training classes, and tens of thousands of teachers received phonetics training. Another example is Shanghai, where the Education Bureau has established four or five cadres to specifically manage the promotion of Putonghua, publishes newsletters to guide the work, and usually pays attention to closely integrating the promotion of Putonghua with primary and secondary school Chinese language teaching. Therefore, many schools in the city can consistently adhere to teaching in Putonghua, and gradually promote the use of Putonghua in other subjects by teachers. Conversely, there are also some provinces, cities, or relevant departments that, from the leadership down, believe that promoting Putonghua is not an urgent task; they are hesitant at the beginning of the promotion, and retreat when encountering difficulties in the promotion, and even want to abolish the Putonghua promotion agency or special personnel. In that case, the promotion of Putonghua cannot be carried out well in these areas or departments. From this, it can be seen that leadership attention is the primary condition for doing a good job in promoting Putonghua.

    At the same time, we must realize that promoting Putonghua is a long-term task that requires the support of the masses in order to proceed smoothly. To this end, we must implement the working policy of "vigorous advocacy, focused promotion, and gradual popularization." Vigorous advocacy is to conduct extensive and in-depth publicity through newspapers, radio stations, reports, forums, Quyi (Chinese folk art forms), and other cultural and entertainment activities, and to take various measures to commend and encourage everyone to speak Putonghua. "Vigorous advocacy" must be combined with "focused promotion." Schools are the focus of promoting Putonghua, and primary and secondary schools and normal schools at all levels are the focus of schools. In all subject teaching, start with the Chinese language subject first, and then extend it to other subjects. In government agencies, organizations, and other aspects of society, first promote it in departments that urgently need to learn Putonghua, such as postal and telecommunications, transportation, and railways, and then gradually promote it to other departments. This steady progress from points to areas can achieve the goal of "gradual popularization."

    Since the promotion of Putonghua is a long-term task that requires the support of the masses, it must be done as a regular, mass-based work. The education departments and bureaus of each province and city and the relevant departments should include the promotion of Putonghua in their regular work plans, with special management agencies and full-time cadres responsible, formulate plans based on the specific situation of the local and relevant departments, and check and urge their implementation. The requirements for learning Putonghua should not be too hasty or too high, and requirements should be put forward realistically according to different conditions. Social publicity work should be done well to eliminate doubts and resistance to the promotion of Putonghua, and strive for the strong assistance of publicity and cultural departments. Extensive and in-depth publicity should be carried out through newspapers, cultural centers (stations), radio stations, broadcasting stations, films, Quyi, and other various mass cultural and recreational activities, exhibitions, lectures, and forums, and people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about promoting Putonghua should be organized to participate in the publicity work, so that the promotion of Putonghua becomes a mass activity. In order to arouse teachers' and students' interest in learning Putonghua, the education departments and bureaus of each province and city can consider trying to run various Putonghua speech contests of different scales, and giving appropriate rewards to teachers and students with excellent results. Now, the Draft Scheme for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet has been announced by the State Council. All provinces and cities should take full advantage of this opportunity to publicize the phonetic alphabet, promote Putonghua, and rekindle the enthusiasm of the masses for learning Putonghua. The phonetic alphabet is the most convenient tool for promoting Putonghua. Learning the phonetic alphabet means mastering the most basic phonetic elements of Putonghua. The most important use of the phonetic alphabet at present is to promote Putonghua. We should first enable people who have studied the original draft of the phonetic alphabet and the phonetic symbols to learn the Draft Scheme for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet, and then use them as the backbone to gradually promote it, so that those who are willing to learn Putonghua can use this scientific phonetic tool.

    The promotion of Putonghua is necessary for socialist construction. We should, on the basis of the achievements already made, and according to the working policy of "vigorous advocacy, focused promotion, and gradual popularization," make the promotion of Putonghua a regular, mass-based work, and strive for the complete unification of the Chinese language.

    继续努力推广普通话
    本报评论员
    从1955年10月全国文字改革会议决议推广普通话以来，到现在已经两年多了。两年来，有六十多万中、小学语文教师受过普通话训练；大部分小学和一部分中学、师范开始用普通话教学；部队、机关、团体中和社会上，也有几百万人从广播或短期训练班中学习了普通话。能说普通话的人比解放前大大增加了。可是，这些成绩比起我国社会主义建设对普通话的需要来说，还是很不够的。就拿北京来说，八年来人口由两百多万增加到四百多万。学校、工厂、机关中不能很好地使用普通话的人还是很多的。在一些新办的中学里，从方言区来的不能很好地用普通话教课的教师占到一半。全国各地工业建设突飞猛进，交通往来日益频繁，各地的工人、技术人员、教员等统一调配使用，部队复员军人和从城市下乡参加农业生产的学生越来越多，言语不通成为生活上和工作上的障碍。
    推广普通话使人们有一种共同语作为表达和交流思想的工具，是十分必要的。这首先有利于我们国家的进一步巩固和加强。汉语的逐步达到完全统一，将使五亿多说汉语的人民免除方言分歧、言语难通的障碍，更加密切无间地团结一致；少数民族的兄弟们，因为工作、学习上有需要而学习汉语的时候，学习普通话也比专学一种方言用处大。其次，规模越来越大的社会主义建设迫切需要人们能说统一而有规范的语言。无论政治、经济、国防和文化教育，都不可能在语言分歧和混乱的情况下顺利前进。汉语本身要发展得更加完善精密，汉字要改革为拼音文字，也需要推广普通话来准备有利的条件。推广普通话虽然已经取得一定成绩，但是，我们的工作还是落后于客观形势的发展。两年来，推广普通话工作开展得也不平衡。1956年曾一度出现过学习普通话的热潮，现在有些冷了下来了，若干地区竟然停顿不前。为什么会这样呢？主要是对推广普通话的重要性认识不足，没有给以足够的重视，因而在具体工作上就没有作适当的安排。
    在去年2月12日，本报发表的“努力推广普通话”的社论中曾经指出：“推广普通话的任务能否在全国范围内迅速地、有效地完成，关键在于各级党政组织和各个有关部门对于这一工作是否充分重视，对于本地区和本部门应该做的工作能否作出全面的具体规划，并且加强领导和检查”。两年来，经验证明这话在今天还是适用的。凡是领导上重视，教育厅（局）有专门机构或人员负责，肯花费力量去推行普通话的省市，虽然方言比较复杂，也能收到可观的效果。比如浙江省，由于党政领导方面比较重视，省推广普通话工作委员会数次开会讨论和布置工作，教育厅办普通话训练班，编课本，并经常派人检查各县市的推广工作，因此推动全省各县市都积极进行推广工作。去年暑假，除去一个受灾的县份外，全省各县市都举办了小学教师语音训练班，数万名教师受过语音训练。又如上海市在教育局下设了四五个干部专管推广普通话工作，出版有指导工作的简报，平时注重使推广普通话工作和中小学语文课教学密切结合，因此该市不少学校能始终坚持用普通话教学，并逐步从语文课推广到其他课目的教师也使用普通话教学。相反地，也有一些省市或有关部门，从领导起就认为推广普通话不是当急之务；推广之初就意存观望，推广中碰到困难就往后退缩，甚至想把推广普通话机构或专人取消。那末，在这些地区或部门中推广普通话工作就不能很好开展。由此可以看到，领导重视是做好普通话推广工作的首要条件。
    同时，我们要认识到，推广普通话是一项长期的工作，需要得到群众的支持，才能够顺利的进行。为此，我们要贯彻“大力提倡、重点推行、逐步普及”的工作方针。大力提倡就是通过报刊、广播电台、报告会、座谈会、曲艺和其他文化娱乐活动来进行广泛、深入的宣传，并采取各项措施来表扬和鼓励大家来说普通话。“大力提倡”须要结合“重点推行”，学校是推广普通话的重点，而学校又以中、小学校和各级师范学校为重点。在各科教学中，首先从语文科开始，然后推广到其它学科。在机关、团体和社会其它方面，首先在迫切需要学习普通话的部门，如邮电、交通、铁路等部门推行，然后逐步推广到其它部门。这样从点到面的稳步前进，就可以达到“逐步普及”的目的。
    推广普通话既然是一项长期工作，需要群众支持，就要把它当作一项经常性的、群众性的工作去做。各省、市教育厅、局和各有关部门应该把推广普通话工作列入经常工作计划，由专管机构和专职干部负责，根据当地和各有关部门的具体情况，订出计划，检查督促执行。对学习普通话的要求，不宜过急过高，要根据不同条件，实事求是地提出要求。要做好社会宣传工作，消除对推广普通话的疑虑和抵触情绪，争取宣传和文化部门的大力协助，通过报刊、文化馆（站）、广播电台、广播站、电影、曲艺和其它各种群众性的文娱活动、展览会、讲演会、座谈会等，展开广泛、深入的宣传，并组织热心推广普通话的各界人士参加宣传工作，使推广普通话成为群众性活动。为了引起教师和学生学习普通话的兴趣，各省、市教育厅、局可以考虑试办各种不同规模的普通话讲演评奖，对于成绩优良的教师和学生给以适当的奖励。现在，汉语拼音方案草案已经由国务院公布。各省市应当充分利用这个机会宣传拼音字母，推广普通话，重新鼓起群众学习普通话的热情。拼音字母是推广普通话的最便利的工具。学会拼音字母，就是掌握了普通话的最基本的语音要素。拼音字母当前最主要的用处，正是推广普通话。我们应当使曾经学过拼音方案原草案和注音字母的人们，首先学会汉语拼音方案草案，然后以他们为骨干，逐步推广，使愿学普通话的，都能运用这种科学的拼音工具。
    推广普通话是为社会主义建设所必需的，我们应该在已有成绩的基础上，根据“大力提倡、重点推行、逐步普及”的工作方针，使推广普通话成为一项经常性、群众性的工作，为汉语的完全统一而奋斗。
