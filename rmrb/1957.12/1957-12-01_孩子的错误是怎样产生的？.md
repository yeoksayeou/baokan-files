　　How do Children's Mistakes Arise?
    Hu Ji
    Parents always hope that their children will grow up to be loyal, resolute, brave, intelligent... people who love their country and love labor. Therefore, when parents see their children developing some bad habits, they feel very distressed and anxious. However, have parents ever thought about how their children's mistakes arise? What faults do they themselves have in their children's wrongdoings? Please, every parent, think back, have the following situations occurred in your family life?
　　Spoiling and Indulgence
    Mom comes home from work, and as soon as she enters the door, she hugs her three-year-old daughter. "I haven't seen you all day, has my little darling grown up?" Mom keeps kissing her daughter's hands and face. Then she sits down, puts her daughter on her lap, and gives her the candies and pastries she brought back, while picking up the newspaper to read. After the child finishes eating a candy, she reaches out to grab a pastry. "Don't move! I'll get it for you." Mom takes a pastry and gives it to the child. The child is not satisfied, pouts, and grabs the candies and pastries in her hands, muttering, "No, I want them all." Mom gets impatient, snatches the candies from the child's hands, and puts her daughter down on the ground, "You've already eaten, you can't eat so many candies and pastries, see how spoiled you are getting!" Then the child cries loudly, lying on the ground throwing a tantrum. Mom shouts loudly, and the child cries even louder. Grandma, who is standing by, can't bear it, "The child is small, what does she know, just give her the candy if she wants it!" In the end, Mom gives her all the candies and pastries.
    Spoiling and indulging children leads them to develop a very bad habit. They understand: as long as they cry and make a fuss, Mom or Grandma will give in to them. The child's willfulness and disobedience arise from this.
　　Intimidation and Deception
    It's very late, and Hua'er is still lying in bed playing. In order to get Hua'er to fall asleep quickly, Grandma tells the story of the little white rabbit being dragged away by the big bad wolf. The light in the room is very dim, the wind blows the window making a hissing sound, Grandma says in a cold tone: "Go to sleep quickly! If you don't sleep, the big bad wolf will come and take you away." The more scared Hua'er is, the harder it is for her to fall asleep. Then Grandma uses tender words to coax Hua'er: "Good child, go to sleep quickly! Tomorrow Grandma will take you to the park and buy you candy...". Hua'er falls asleep with complex emotions of fear and anticipation. The next day, Grandma does not fulfill her promise. In the evening, she still uses intimidation and deception to get Hua'er to fall asleep.
    Obviously, both of these ways of treating children are harmful. Intimidation will make children become timid, cowardly, and neurotic; deception will cause children to distrust their parents, and make them learn to lie and deceive.
　　Boasting and Blaming
    Some guests are sitting around at home. The child is running around in the crowd.
    Mom starts boasting about her child: "This child is extremely smart, can sing, can write, can..." Mom boasts about everything the child can do. The guests also praise him with you saying this and I saying that, asking the child to sing and write, and suddenly the child becomes the center of attention.
    Sometimes, the child accidentally makes a mistake, so Mom blames the child in front of many people: "This child is the most disobedient, annoying in every way, get out of my sight!"
    Here, the mother forgets the most basic principle of education: do not boast about the child in front of him, and do not blame him in front of many people. Overly praising children will make them become vain and insincere; blaming children in front of many people easily makes them become lacking in confidence.
    From the above few things, we can draw this conclusion: "There are no bad children, only bad educational methods."

　　孩子的错误是怎样产生的？
    胡集
    做父母的对于自己的孩子，总希望他们长大了成为一个忠诚、刚毅、勇敢、聪明……爱祖国、爱劳动的人。因此，当父母看见自己孩子产生了某些不良习惯的时候，感到十分痛心和焦急。但是，做父母的有没有想一想，孩子身上的错误是怎样产生的呢？在孩子的错误行为中，自己有什么过失呢？请每个做父母的回想一下，你们在家庭生活中，有没有发生过以下情形？
　　娇惯和迁就
    妈妈下班回家了，一进门，就把三岁的小女儿抱在怀里。“一天没有见了，我的小宝贝长大了没有？”妈妈不住地亲吻着女儿的手、脸。然后坐下来，把女儿放在膝上，给她吃带回来的糖果、点心，一面拿起报纸来看。孩子吃完了一块糖，又要伸手拿点心。“别动！我给你拿。”妈妈拿了一块点心给孩子。孩子不满足，鼓着嘴把糖果、点心抓在手里，嘴里嘟念着：“不，我全要。”妈妈不耐烦了，从孩子手里把糖果抢过来，把女儿放下地，“已经吃了饭，不能吃很多糖果和点心，看把你娇惯成什么样子了！”于是孩子大哭起来，躺在地上撒泼、打滚。妈妈大声喊叫着，孩子哭得更加厉害。奶奶在一旁受不住了，“孩子小，懂得什么，她要吃糖就给她好啦！”最后，妈妈又把糖果、点心全给了她。
    对孩子娇惯和迁就，使孩子养成一种很不好的习惯，他懂得：只要大哭大闹一顿，妈妈或奶奶就向他让步。孩子的任性和不听话就从此产生了。
　　威吓和哄骗
    时间已经很晚了，华儿还躺在被窝里玩。为了让华儿快点睡着，奶奶讲起小白兔被大灰狼拖走的故事。屋子里的灯光非常昏暗，窗子被风吹得发出嘶嘶的响声，奶奶用阴冷的语调说：“快点睡！不睡，大灰狼就来抱你了”。华儿心里越害怕，越睡不着。于是奶奶又用温存的话哄华儿：“好孩子，快睡吧！明天奶奶带你上公园，买糖……”。华儿怀着又是惊恐，又是期待的复杂情绪入睡了。第二天，奶奶并没有实现自己的诺言。到了晚上，她仍然用威吓和哄骗的办法引华儿入睡。
    显然，这两种对待孩子的态度都是有害的。威吓，会使孩子变得胆小、怯懦、神经质；哄骗，更会造成孩子对父母的不信任，使他们学会说谎和欺骗。
　　夸耀和责备
    家里围坐着一些客人。小孩子在人群里钻来钻去。
    妈妈开始夸耀起自己的孩子了：“这孩子聪明极了，会唱歌，会写字，会……”妈妈把孩子每一件能做的事情都夸耀了一番。客人们也你一言、我一语地赞许着，叫孩子唱歌、写字，顿时孩子成了人们注意的中心。
    有时，孩子偶然犯了一点错误，于是妈妈在许多人面前责备孩子了：“这孩子最不听话，处处让人讨厌，还不快给我滚！”。
    在这里，做妈妈的忘记了最普通的教育原理：不要当着孩子的面夸耀他，也不要在许多人面前责备他。对孩子的过分夸耀，就会使孩子成为好虚荣、不朴实的人；在许多人面前责备孩子，容易使孩子变得缺乏自信。
    从以上的几件事情，我们可以得出这样的结论：“没有不好的孩子，只有不好的教育方法”。
