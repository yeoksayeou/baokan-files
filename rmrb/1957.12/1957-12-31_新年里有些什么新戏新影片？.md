What New Plays and Films are There for the New Year?

    "Ode to the Motherland" and "Congratulations"
    The Capital Wide-Screen Cinema will screen two newly produced color documentaries from New Year's Day: "Ode to the Motherland" and "Congratulations." "Ode to the Motherland" records the actual situation of the people of the capital celebrating the National Day of 1957, and also briefly introduces the remarkable achievements of our country on the production and construction front in the eight years since the founding of the country. What appears on the screen first is a magnificent and majestic picture: the sun leaps out of the East China Sea, and the earth is full of brilliance. The Mao Zedong locomotive gallops on the fertile land. The Yangtze River Bridge, like a silver dragon, is also displayed before our eyes... Then, the scene of the people of the capital celebrating the festival appears.
    "Congratulations" expresses the same inspiring thing: the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China went to Moscow to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. In this film, we can see various activities of the delegation, as well as Chairman Mao signing the peace declaration and meeting with students studying in the Soviet Union.
    Zhang Zhibin and Su Heqing, the editors and photographers of the film, went to the Soviet Union with the delegation for interviews. Ge. Lagov and Troshkin, photographers from the Moscow Central Documentary Film Studio, also participated in the photography of this film.

    "Golden Eagle" from the Grassland
    The Beijing People's Art Theater is rushing to rehearse a four-act, seven-scene drama "Golden Eagle" reflecting the life and struggle of fraternal nationalities, and is preparing to officially premiere it on January 6, 1958.
    "Golden Eagle" is a multi-act play written by Chao Ketu Naren, a young writer from Inner Mongolia. It is set against the dark age when princes and nobles cruelly ruled the grassland. Through the protagonist Bu'er Gude's (meaning eagle in Mongolian) resolute resistance to the prince and his loyalty to love, it vividly embodies the firm will and virtues of the grassland people in their struggle for freedom and happiness. This play is like a narrative poem, and the characters, plot, and language are full of beautiful and moving colors. The poetic and picturesque life of the grassland people is revealed in every scene on the stage.
    In order to perform this play reflecting the life of fraternal nationalities, the Beijing People's Art Theater, in July last year, led more than 20 actors and stage art workers, led by Jin Li, one of the directors of the play, to go deep into Inner Mongolia to experience life. During the rehearsal, they also invited comrades from Inner Mongolia of the Nationalities Institute to teach singing and dancing, so as to more truly reflect the life of fraternal nationalities.
    Ten One-Act Plays
    To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the drama movement, the Central Academy of Drama will present ten one-act plays performed by students from New Year's Day: "Oppression," "Put Down Your Whip," "Sixteen Guns," "Happy Reunion," "Grain," "The More You Beat It, the Fatter It Gets," "Monkeys," "Anti-Turnover Struggle," "Zhao Xiaolan," and "Women's Representative." These plays reflect the great struggle life and revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people in various revolutionary periods, and also show the development path of the drama industry in the past 50 years.

    Cadres Going to Lower Levels on the Screen
    Newsreel No. 71 reflects the situation of cadres sent to lower levels across the country participating in physical labor in rural areas.
    The scenes of Beijing, Tianjin, Xining, Fuzhou and other places warmly sending off cadres to the countryside and mountains appeared on the screen, narrating how they learned to work, and their labor on reservoir construction sites, fields, pig farms, etc. From this, we can also see Hu Guangming, a female cadre sent to the China-Czechoslovakia Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing, writing a letter to tell her lover about her feelings and gains, which deeply moved her lover who was still reluctant to let her go to the lower levels not long ago, and also asked to go to the countryside to transform himself. We can also see the moving facts of Fang Zhichun, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, leading more than 500 cadres who had been sent to lower levels to the Damao Mountain, where they had fought guerrillas 30 years ago, to reclaim wasteland.

    新年里有些什么新戏新影片？
    “祖国颂”和“祝贺”
    首都宽银幕电影院从元旦起将放映两部最新出品的彩色纪录片：“祖国颂”和“祝贺”。“祖国颂”纪录了首都人民庆祝1957年国庆节的实况，同时也概略地介绍了我国建国八年以来在生产建设战线上的卓越成就。首先出现在银幕上的，是壮丽雄伟的画面：太阳跃出了东海面，大地一片光彩。毛泽东号机车在富饶的土地上奔驰。银龙般的长江大桥也展现在我们眼前……接着，首都人民欢度节日的情景出现了。
    “祝贺”表现的同样是振奋人心的事情：中华人民共和国政府代表团赴莫斯科庆祝十月革命四十周年。在这部影片中，我们可以看到代表团的各种活动以及毛主席签署和平宣言，和接见留苏学生等情形。
    影片的编辑兼摄影张治滨和苏河清曾随代表团赴苏采访。莫斯科中央纪录电影制片厂摄影师格?拉格夫和特洛什金也参加了本片的摄影工作。

    从草原来的“金鹰”
    北京人民艺术剧院正在赶排一出反映兄弟民族生活斗争的四幕七场话剧“金鹰”，准备于1958年1月6日起正式公演。
    “金鹰”，是内蒙古青年作家超克图纳仁写的多幕剧，以王公贵族残酷统治着草原的黑暗时代为背景，通过主人公布尔固德（在蒙古语中即鹰的意思）坚决反抗王爷和忠贞于爱情的行为，形象地体现了草原人民为自由幸福而斗争的坚决意志和美德。这出戏像一篇叙事诗，人物性格、故事情节和语言都充满优美动人绚丽的色泽，草原人民诗情画意的生活从舞台上每个场面里流露出来。
    北京人艺为演出这个反映兄弟民族生活的戏，在去年7月间，就由该剧导演之一的金犁率领演员、舞台美术工作者二十多人，到内蒙古深入生活，在排练中他们还请民族学院内蒙古的同志们教歌教舞，以便更真切地把兄弟民族的生活情况反映出来。
    十个独幕剧
    中央戏剧学院为纪念话剧运动五十年，自元旦起将由学生实习演出“压迫”、“放下你的鞭子”、“十六条枪”、“喜相逢”、“粮食”、“越打越肥”、“群猴”、“反翻把斗争”、“赵小兰”、“妇女代表”十个独幕剧。这些戏反映了我国人民在各个革命时期伟大的斗争生活和革命精神，也展示了话剧事业五十年来发展的途径。

    干部下放上银幕
    新闻简报七十一号反映了全国各地下放干部在农村中参加体力劳动的情景。
    银幕上出现了北京、天津、西宁、福州等地热烈欢送干部们下乡上山的情形，叙述了他们是怎样学会干活的，和他们在水库工地上、田间、养猪场等劳动的情况。从中我们还可以看到下放到北京郊区中捷友谊农业社的女干部胡光明，写信把自己的感受和收获告诉爱人，使他不久前还不乐意她下放的爱人深受感动，也要求到农村去改造自己了。我们也可以看到中共江西省委书记方志纯同志带领五百多名下放干部来到三十年前打过游击的大茅山，开荒等动人事实。
