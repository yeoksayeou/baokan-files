Notes

Such a Wonderful Use
After the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting, Washington is whipping up a frenzy of arms expansion and war preparation. At this time, the so-called "Gaither Committee"’s "top-secret report" was disclosed.

It is not at all surprising that the "Gaither Committee" wants to exhaust all methods to incite an arms race in order to seek excess profits for the American monopoly groups it represents. What is strange is that since it is a so-called "top-secret report," how could it suddenly be made public in the newspapers?

According to the "Washington Post," which disclosed this "report," the U.S. President, after reading this "report," had "repeatedly" expressed "concern" that the American people would not pay for it. It was under this "concern" that this "report" was publicly disclosed, and senators also clamored to demand the publication of this "top-secret" document.

This well-coordinated chorus is obviously creating a kind of hysteria in order to force the American people to come up with money for this crazy war preparation plan. That is the wonderful use of the "Gaither Committee"’s "top-secret report" becoming a public document.

    有此妙用
    在北大西洋集团会议之后，华盛顿正在加工制造扩军备战的热潮。在这个时候“盖瑟委员会”的所谓“绝密报告”被披露了。
    这个“盖瑟委员会”要想尽方法煽动军备竞赛，以便从中为它所代表的美国垄断集团谋取超额利润，这是丝毫也不足为奇的。人们奇怪的是既然是所谓“绝密报告”，怎么忽然会在报纸上公开了呢？
    据披露这个“报告”的“华盛顿邮报”说，美国总统在看了这个“报告”后，曾“反复地”表示“担心”美国人民不会出钱。就是在这种“担心”下，这个“报告”被公开披露了，而且参议员们也就叫嚷起来要求公布这个“绝密”文件了。
    这种配合得很好的合唱，显然是在制造一种歇斯底里，以便迫使美国人民为这个疯狂的备战计划拿出钱来。“盖瑟委员会”的“绝密报告”变成公开文件的妙用就在这里。
