    Seyf al-Islam Muhammad al-Badr, Crown Prince, Deputy Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and Defense Minister of the Kingdom of Yemen, is visiting our country at the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai. The Chinese people wholeheartedly welcome this guest from the kingdom on the Red Sea coast.
    Badr is the eldest son of King Ahmad of Yemen. He was born in 1926 and educated in his own country. Later, he served as the governor of Hodeidah Province.
    In April 1955, a group of careerists headed by Emir Abdullah, the then Foreign Minister, launched a coup in Yemen under the instigation of imperialism. They placed King Ahmad under house arrest, attempting to force him to abdicate. At that time, Crown Prince Badr gathered and led 8,000 soldiers and tribal warriors from other places to the palace, crushing the coup and preventing the subversive activities carried out by the imperialists on this land.
    After this, the government of the Kingdom of Yemen was reorganized. The King personally served as Prime Minister, and Badr served as Deputy Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and Defense Minister, until now.
    Badr is a prestigious Arab politician. He supports the cause of defending national independence and world peace.
    In April 1956, King Ahmad, accompanied by Badr, held talks with Egyptian President Nasser and Saudi Arabian King Saud. During this meeting, the three countries signed the Egyptian-Saudi-Yemeni military treaty to protect their independence and security, and established a joint command of the three countries in accordance with the treaty. These measures are conducive to safeguarding peace in the Middle East and maintaining national independence.
    In June and July of the same year, Badr visited the Soviet Union, Democratic Germany, and Czechoslovakia successively, promoting the further strengthening of friendly relations between Yemen and these countries. When Badr was in the Soviet Union, he said in a statement: I am proud of this friendship and will do my best to develop and consolidate this friendship in order to promote close cooperation between the people of the two countries and promote the prosperity of peace and happiness. When he visited Cairo on his way back home after the visit, it was the time when Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal. He immediately expressed Yemen's full support for Egypt's just action, and pointed out that Egypt could use Yemen's armed forces and resources to repel any Western aggression. Before visiting our country this time, Badr had visited the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Romania, Poland, and Yugoslavia. During his visits to Romania and Poland, he also decided to establish diplomatic relations with each other.
    Badr cherishes friendly feelings towards China. Two months before Yemen and our country officially established diplomatic relations last year, Badr had already made a statement pointing out that nothing could prevent Yemen from recognizing the People's Republic of China. Now Crown Prince Badr has personally come to China. The Chinese people firmly believe that through this visit, the friendly relations between Yemen and our country will be further strengthened.

    巴德尔简历
    也门王国王太子、副首相兼外交大臣和国防大臣塞弗·伊斯兰·穆罕默德·巴德尔应周恩来总理的邀请，到我国进行友好访问。中国人民衷心欢迎这位来自红海之滨的王国的客人。
    巴德尔是也门国王艾哈迈德的长子，他生于1926年，在本国受教育。后来担任了荷台达省的省长。
    1955年4月，在帝国主义的策动下，以原任外交大臣埃米尔·阿卜杜拉为首的一群野心家，在也门发动了政变。他们软禁了艾哈迈德国王，企图强迫他退位，当时，王太子巴德尔集合和率领了八千名军队和部落武士，从外地赶到王宫，粉碎了这次政变，阻止了帝国主义者在这块土地上进行的颠覆活动。
    在此以后，也门王国政府进行了改组。国王亲自兼任首相，由巴德尔担任副首相兼外交大臣和国防大臣，一直到现在。
    巴德尔是有声望的阿拉伯政治家。他支持保卫民族独立和世界和平的事业。
    1956年4月，艾哈迈德国王偕同巴德尔同埃及总统纳赛尔、沙特阿拉伯国王沙特举行会谈，在这次会谈中，三国签订了为保卫它们的独立和安全的埃沙也三国军事条约，并且根据条约，成立了三国联合司令部。这些措施有利于保障中东和平和维护国家的独立。
    同年6、7月间，巴德尔先后访问了苏联、民主德国和捷克斯洛伐克，促进了也门和这些国家的友好关系的进一步加强。巴德尔在苏联的时候，发表谈话说：我为这种友谊而感到自豪，并且将竭尽全力发展和巩固这种友谊，以促进两国人民之间的密切合作，促进和平和幸福的繁荣。当他访问结束回国经过开罗的时候，正值埃及把苏伊士运河收归国有，他当即表示也门完全支持埃及这一正义行动，并指出埃及可以利用也门的武装部队和资源来击退西方的任何侵略。巴德尔这次来我国访问之前，曾经先后到英国、意大利、法国、罗马尼亚、波兰和南斯拉夫进行了访问。他在罗马尼亚和波兰访问期间，还决定了相互建立外交关系。
    巴德尔对中国怀抱着友好的感情。在去年也门和我国正式建交的前两个月，巴德尔已经发表谈话指出，没有什么事情能够阻止也门承认中华人民共和国。现在巴德尔王太子亲自来到了中国，中国人民坚信，通过这次访问，也门和我国的友好关系将得到更进一步地加强。（附图片）
