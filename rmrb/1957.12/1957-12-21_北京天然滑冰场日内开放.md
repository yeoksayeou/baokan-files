    Beijing Natural Ice Rinks to Open in a Few Days

    (Our newspaper reports) All natural ice rinks in Beijing have frozen over and will open in a few days. The temperature has plummeted in the past few days, and the ice layer at the five ice rinks in the capital – Shichahai, Beihai, Zhongshan Park, Cultural Palace, and Taoranting – is currently more than six inches thick. The venues have been smoothed to a mirror-like finish, and lighting, cloakroom, ticket sales, and other equipment are all ready. They will open once the ice layer reaches seven inches.

    The Zizhuyuan ice rink, newly opened by the Beijing Sports Commission in the western suburbs, opened on the 20th.

    In order to meet the needs of thousands of ice skating enthusiasts in the capital, this year all ice rinks will extend their opening hours, and the night lighting will be stronger than in previous years. There will also be more ice skates for rent than last year. Each ice rink will also hire specialists to teach basic skating techniques to beginners.

    This year, each ice rink will also add children's skating areas. A large number of children's ice skates and ice sleds have been prepared for use by children.

    Beijing's six ice rinks have a total area of more than 90,000 square meters. (An)
