Fifteen and a Half Jin Gold Brick
    Shang Dongtai, a poor peasant from Caizhai Township, Changge County, recently took out a large gold brick weighing fifteen and a half jin to invest in the construction of rural water conservancy projects.
    This gold brick was found by Shang Dongtai's younger brother, Shang Shuzhen, in the summer of 1944 in Xuchang while he was building air-raid shelters for the Japanese and digging up bricks from the Yuan Da Egg Factory, which was run by Americans. At first, people thought it was a copper brick and paid no attention. However, Shang Shuzhen, recalling the fact that Americans at the time were plundering the Chinese people's hard-earned money to buy gold and cast it into gold bricks to transport back to their country, was certain that it was a gold brick. He gave it to his older brother to bury underground.
    Shang Dongtai underwent an ideological struggle for a whole day and night before taking out this gold brick. On the 27th of last month, when the township held a meeting to mobilize agricultural cooperative members to invest in water conservancy construction, he felt that as a county-level agricultural labor model, he should actively invest. However, he was reluctant to actually take out the gold brick. After thinking it over and over, he felt that this gold brick was the product of imperialism's exploitation of the Chinese people's blood and sweat and should not be kept for himself. He finally dug it out of the ground and selflessly dedicated it to the country. (Xinhua News Agency)

    十五斤半重的金砖
    长葛县蔡寨乡贫农尚东太最近拿出一块十五斤半重的大金砖，投资建设农村水利事业。
    这块金砖是1944年夏天，尚东太的弟弟尚书珍在许昌替日本人修防空洞，扒美国人开办的元大蛋厂的砖头时拣到的。最初人们都以为它是铜砖，没有注意。而尚书珍连想到当时美国人搜刮中国人民的血汗钱买金子，铸成金砖运回本国的事实，肯定它是金砖，便交给他的哥哥埋藏在地下。
    尚东太拿出这块金砖时，经过了一昼夜的思想斗争。上月27日，乡里开会动员农业社社员投资建设水利的时候，他觉得自己是县的农业劳动模范，应该积极投资，然而真要把这块金砖拿出，又舍不得，他想来想去觉得这块金砖是帝国主义剥削中国人民的血汗，不该占为己有，终于从地底挖了出来，无代价地献给了国家。　（新华社）
