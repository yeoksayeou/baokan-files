In our country's rural areas, since autumn, two major upsurges have emerged: an upsurge of socialist ideological education and an upsurge of agricultural production and construction. These two upsurges have been mutually promoting, and have already brought about tremendous changes in the vast rural areas, reaping unprecedented harvests. Can the achievements gained in these two upsurges be consolidated for a long time to come? Can the victories be continuously expanded? Judging from the current situation, there are two important keys: one is to further promote the nationwide rectification movement in rural areas, transition to the rectification and improvement phase, and do a good job in the work of rectifying the communes, the Party, and the Youth League; the other is to expand the scope of the agricultural production and construction movement. In addition to continuing to concentrate main efforts on striving for greater victories in basic farmland construction, it is also necessary to do a good job in winter sideline production and other tasks. That is to say, it is necessary to simultaneously grasp production and rectification, and to promote each other.

In the previous period, a great debate centered on the grain issue, regarding the two roads in rural areas, was launched in the vast rural areas. The socialist righteousness quickly overwhelmed the capitalist evil winds. The tails that counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and some landlords and rich peasants had cocked up for a period of time were quickly beaten down. The capitalist activities of some well-to-do peasants were also basically stopped. The political consciousness of the peasant masses and rural cadres generally improved a great step, distinguishing the major rights and wrongs on important issues such as grain and collectivization, and strengthening their confidence in advancing on the socialist road. The socialist ideological flowers blossomed luxuriantly and bore rich fruits. This year's grain purchase work can generally be completed ahead of schedule by two months, and some provinces have already completed it. The progress of cotton procurement is even faster than last year, and by November 15, the country had completed more than 76% of the annual task.

After the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program was published, farmers in various places were greatly encouraged. In many villages, while launching a great debate on production and construction, they immediately took practical actions to strive for a great leap forward in production and construction. This production upsurge, compared with the previous winter-spring production upsurge that closely followed the agricultural cooperativization upsurge, started earlier, had higher enthusiasm, larger scale, faster progress, more experience, and steadier steps. Winter farmland water conservancy repairs are generally two to three months earlier than in previous years. According to incomplete statistics from seven provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Jilin alone, the irrigated area has been expanded by more than 16 million mu by early November, accounting for 33% of the seven provinces' annual plan (only 3%-4% of the annual plan was completed in the same period two years ago and last year). Shaanxi Province has made particularly rapid progress, with an average of 70,000 mu of dry land being turned into irrigated land every day in early and mid-November, and the completed projects by November 20 have exceeded the original annual plan by 47.5%. In Hebei Province, more than 4.9 million farmers were invested in water conservancy construction in mid-November, and the irrigated area has been expanded by more than 3 million mu. In terms of water conservancy construction, it is a "mass army mobilized," and in terms of manure accumulation, it is a "mass transportation." As of November 20, Hebei Province had accumulated more than 80 billion jin of fertilizer, and in Cangxian and Baoding alone, 760,000 people were engaged in fertilizer accumulation activities every day, accounting for 30% of the total labor force. Currently, nearly 11 million laborers in Hunan Province are involved in the production upsurge, accounting for more than 90% of the province's total labor force. By November 20, 1.1 billion dan of fertilizer had been accumulated, 600 million dan more than the same period last year; various plans have been completed 95%, 2.59 million mu more than the same period last year. In addition, the northern provinces are expanding winter irrigation, and the southern provinces are expanding winter planting. Many areas have formulated advanced production plans, determined to complete and exceed the production targets stipulated in the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. The entire countryside is full of vigorous revolutionary vitality.

In order to make the agricultural production and construction movement develop healthily, what should be noted at present is that we must continue to oppose blind conservatism, but also oppose blind empty talk. Planning without action is useless, and planning that is large and high but lacks concrete measures is also useless. At any time, we must conduct in-depth investigations, rely on the masses, seek truth from facts, and be down-to-earth. Production plans should be full of positive and enterprising spirit, and should also appropriately leave room for maneuver, so that cadres and the masses have the confidence to exceed it, without dampening their enthusiasm when encountering unexpected difficulties. It should also be noted that the great leap forward in agricultural production depends on multifaceted efforts; the long-term interests should be appropriately combined with the current interests. In order to prepare more funds for next year's agricultural production, and in order to solve the living difficulties of farmers in some disaster areas, it is necessary to develop winter sideline production. The work of protecting and breeding draught animals and other preparations for spring plowing, and the field management of winter crops, should not be neglected.

In order to make the socialist system more solid, there are still some major problems that must be solved. In terms of the work style of agricultural cooperative cadres, the relationship between cadres and the masses, business management, financial distribution, etc., all need to be vigorously rectified and improved. That is to say, a series of rectification work should be carried out in agricultural cooperatives in accordance with the three instructions issued by the CPC Central Committee on September 14 regarding the rectification of agricultural production cooperatives, doing a good job in the production management of agricultural cooperatives, and implementing mutually beneficial policies within agricultural cooperatives. That is to say, like what most factories, agencies, and schools have already done, the rectification movement in rural areas should also be shifted to the stage of rectification and improvement.

At present, in most areas, the great debate centered on the grain issue, regarding the two roads in rural areas, has come to an end. Although there are still a considerable number of areas that have not been thoroughly debated and are still in a "half-baked" state, judging from the overall situation, the countercurrent has been reversed and the social order has become more stable. In this case, it is possible and necessary to turn the spearhead of the struggle towards the shortcomings and errors in our own work, "set fire to ourselves," and "burn" all the things that are not conducive to the healthy development of agricultural cooperatives and the production movement. Only in this way can the large-scale production movement be carried out more vigorously, and at the same time, the nationwide rectification movement can be carried out more deeply. Some places did not fully voice and expose problems in the previous period, and now it is appropriate to combine them with the commune rectification movement to launch a great airing of views again. In this way, the masses can put forward more opinions, so as to "choose the good ones and follow them." At present, generally speaking, we should concentrate our efforts on grasping the rectification of work style, the rectification of organization, the improvement of work, and the improvement of production. In this great airing of views, some people may still raise incorrect opinions. If these opinions are closely related to the rectification of the commune and current production, and must be resolved immediately, debates can be carried out without hindering production and commune rectification, and in a way that is beneficial to production and commune rectification. As for general ideological issues, there is no need to rush to argue at present, but can be left to a later period to launch a great debate.

We must treat the shortcomings and errors in our work with a correct attitude. Most agricultural cooperatives have only been established for two years. In these two years, due to lack of experience, some places have indeed encountered some difficulties in some work, and some problems have also occurred. Of course, we must never draw the conclusion from this that since there is a lack of experienced cadres, so many cooperatives should not have been established all at once, and that this was "rash advance." In two years of production, agricultural cooperatives have withstood severe tests in major and minor disasters. Facts have long proven that agricultural cooperativization is not a "rash advance" but a healthy great leap forward. Two years ago, there was a lack of experience, and after two years of practice, a lot of experience has been added. Successful experience can be gained from the advantages and achievements of running cooperatives, and lessons of failure can also be gained from shortcomings and errors. Achievements must be affirmed; shortcomings must be overcome. Obliterating the achievements of running cooperatives will cause us to lose our direction and lose confidence, which is extremely unfavorable to the socialist cause; only enemies of socialism deliberately obliterate the achievements of agricultural cooperatives. Covering up the shortcomings of running cooperatives will cause us to be plagued by diseases and lack the power to act, which is also extremely unfavorable to the socialist cause; only enemies of socialism like us to have shortcomings and not overcome them. Many facts have shown that it is precisely because there are still shortcomings in the work of running cooperatives that landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements have the opportunity to take advantage of, and that people with particularly serious capitalist ideas have loopholes to exploit. These all show how important it is to rectify agricultural cooperatives. Rectification is the best way to promote advantages, consolidate achievements, overcome shortcomings, correct errors, summarize experience, improve cadres, strengthen unity, and advance work. The CPC Central Committee has repeatedly instructed that rectification work should be carried out once a year. This year, this work must not be allowed to slip away because of busy work, but should be done better in accordance with the principle of correctly handling contradictions among the people.

Who should rectify the agricultural cooperatives? As with the previous stage of the rectification movement, we must resolutely rely on the majority of the masses. First of all, we must let the masses speak freely in meetings or in individual heart-to-heart talks, criticize the shortcomings or errors of cadres, and expose the shortcomings and problems in the work without omission. Then, organize small meetings with the participation of mass representatives to investigate the facts and distinguish responsibilities. If the criticism is correct, the person responsible should make a public self-criticism and earnestly correct it; if the masses have misunderstandings, the facts should be listed and explained clearly; if it should be systematically improved, an improvement plan should be studied with the masses; if it should be seriously dealt with, a method of handling it should be studied with the masses. Rectifying the commune on the basis of mass criticism and self-criticism, while rectifying the Party and the Youth League, is a "more, faster, better, and more economical" way to improve work, improve cadres, and strengthen the combat effectiveness of Party and Youth League organizations. Only in this way can the minds of cadres be highly clear, can the shortcomings of the work be completely eliminated, can the relationship between the Party and the masses and the relationship between cadres and the masses be improved most rapidly, and can the ideological level and work ability be improved most effectively. The experience of many places has proven that many problems that cannot be solved for a long time in peacetime can be solved quickly, thoroughly, and effortlessly in the mass commune rectification movement. To rely on the majority of the masses, we must trust the majority of the masses. Of course, we must also trust the majority of township and commune cadres. At present, there are still some ideological obstacles among township and commune cadres and the masses regarding the use of mass criticism and self-criticism to rectify the commune. The commune rectification work team must first help township and commune cadres eliminate ideological obstacles, so that they believe in the Party and believe in the masses. They must understand the necessity of mobilizing the masses to participate in the rectification of the commune, and not be afraid of the masses "going too far," and believe that the vast majority of the masses love socialism and are able to distinguish right from wrong; do not be afraid of "losing face," only by correcting shortcomings and errors can they truly preserve their "face"; do not be afraid of "collapsing" the commune, only by letting the commune members speak out their opinions is it conducive to the consolidation of the commune. First explain these principles to township and commune cadres and Party members and Youth League members, so that they are mentally prepared, and they will be able to treat the rectification work and the opinions raised by the masses with a correct attitude. Some commune members are afraid of "retaliation," afraid of "offending people," and afraid that raising opinions will "not work." In order to break these ideological obstacles, the work team needs to explain the Party's policies to the masses, explain that the handling of contradictions among the people and the handling of contradictions between ourselves and the enemy are completely different, and also needs the township and commune cadres to sincerely and clearly express their attitude and determination to improve work and rectify work style to the masses. More important is actual action, and we must correctly treat the opinions raised by the masses from the beginning, and resolutely rectify and change whatever can be corrected quickly. As long as this is done, the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in the rectification of the commune will quickly rise.

At present, it is the most tense time for building farmland water conservancy, accumulating manure, and other winter production activities. At the same time, it is necessary to launch a great debate on agricultural production and construction around the revised draft of the Agricultural Development Program, formulate production plans, and rectify the commune, the Party, and the Youth League. How should the work be arranged? These tasks are indeed very important, and none of them should be squeezed out. This requires Party committees at all levels to strengthen leadership, appropriately arrange the time, and closely combine the work. It is quite tense to do all the work at the same time, but it is by no means impossible. Discussing the revised draft of the Agricultural Development Program and rectifying the commune can be done in the evening, without occupying daytime production time. Generally speaking, the discussion of the program can be regarded as the first step in rectifying the commune (according to the instructions of the CPC Central Committee on rectifying the commune, discussing the revised draft of the Agricultural Development Program and formulating production plans is an important part of the work of rectifying the commune). This will be enough with seven to ten evenings. In the course of discussing the program item by item and formulating the plan item by item, the issues of production management, accumulation and distribution, business policy, and cadre work style of the agricultural cooperative will inevitably be involved; especially the first item of the program, which is "consolidating the agricultural cooperation system," has a more direct relationship with rectifying the commune. After discussing the program, it is natural to move to comprehensive rectification of the commune—a great airing of views, rectifying while changing. As for the work of formulating a production plan, if there has been sufficient preparation in the past, it can be done simultaneously in the discussion of the program; if there has not been sufficient preparation in the past, it may as well be interspersed during the rectification period.

A great airing of views, rectifying while changing, as long as it is well grasped, will not hinder production. On the contrary, doing so can greatly promote production. All agricultural cooperatives that have implemented a great airing of views and rectified while changing have been producing with extra vigor. This is because the work style of cadres has changed, the labor organization has been rationalized, the resistance to production has been eliminated, and the masses love their collective undertakings even more. Henan Province did a very good job in the work of fighting drought and planting wheat this year, precisely because this work was carried out in the midst of mobilizing the masses for a great airing of views and a great debate. In the airing of views and debate, the ideological problem of whether wheat can be planted in drought was solved, and the cadres were also urged to improve their work methods and work style, promote the wisdom of the masses, and mobilize the strength of the masses. The more thoroughly the airing of views and the faster the changes, the higher the production enthusiasm. Many facts show that as long as the rectification of the commune and production are closely combined, the rectification work can be done well even in the busiest season of farming.

At present, in the vast rural areas, the three instructions issued by the CPC Central Committee on September 14 regarding the rectification of agricultural cooperatives should be vigorously, universally, and deeply publicized and explained to the commune members and township and commune cadres. In the previous period, in many places, because a great debate centered on grain and other issues and autumn harvesting and autumn planting of grain purchases were being carried out intensively, there was not enough time to publicize them to the broad masses with sufficient strength after the three instructions were issued. Now is the time. It should be understood that these three instructions are the most powerful weapon to mobilize the masses to air their views and promote the rural rectification movement. These instructions concentrate the demands of the broad masses; if they are handed over to the broad masses to master, they will generate tremendous power, making the agricultural cooperation system more solid and agricultural production and construction more prosperous.

### 生产整社两不误

    生产整社两不误
    在我国农村里，从秋天到现在，出现了两大高潮：社会主义思想教育的高潮和农业生产建设的高潮。这两个高潮互相推进，已经使广大农村发生了巨大的变化，获得了空前的收获。在这两个高潮中得到的成就能不能长期巩固下去，战果能不能继续扩大呢？从目前的情况看来，有两个重要的关键：一个是把农村中的全民整风运动推进一步，转入整改阶段，把整社、整党、整团工作做好；一个是扩大农业生产建设运动的范围，除了继续集中主要力量争取农田基本建设的更大胜利以外，还要把冬季副业生产等项工作做好。这就是说，要做到生产整社两不误，并且使整社和生产互相推进。
    前一个时期，广大农村展开了以粮食问题为中心的关于农村两条道路的大辩论。社会主义的正气很快就压倒了资本主义的歪风。反革命分子、坏分子和部分地主富农分子曾经有一个时期翘得很高的尾巴很快就被打了下去。部分富裕农民的资本主义活动也基本上制止了。农民群众和农村干部的政治觉悟普遍提高了一大步，在粮食、合作化等重要问题上分清了大是大非，坚定了在社会主义道路上前进的信心。社会主义思想鲜花怒放，而且结了丰满的果实。今年的粮食征购工作一般可以比往年提前两个月超额完成，有些省份现在已经完成。棉花收购工作的进展比上年度快得更多，到11月15日全国已完成了全年任务的76％以上。
    全国农业发展纲要修正草案公布以后，各地农民受了有力的鼓舞。在许多乡村，一面展开了关于生产建设的大辩论，一面立即用实际行动争取生产建设大跃进。这次生产高潮，同前冬去春紧接着农业合作化的高潮出现的那次生产高潮比起来，动手更早，劲头更高，规模更大，进度更快，经验更多，脚步更稳。冬修农田水利一般比往年提早了两三个月。仅据河北、河南、山东、山西、陕西、甘肃、吉林七个省到11月初的不完全统计，已扩大灌溉面积一千六百多万亩，占七省年度计划的33％（前年和去年同一个时期只完成年度计划的3％—4％）。其中陕西省进展得特别快，11月上旬和中旬平均每天有七万亩旱地变成水浇地，到11月20日完成的工程已超过原定年度计划47.5％。河北省11月中旬投入水利建设的农民达四百九十多万人，已经扩大灌溉面积三百多万亩。在兴修水利方面是“千军万马齐出动”，在积肥方面是“千车万担总动员”。河北省到11月20日为止已积肥八百多亿斤，只是沧县、保定两专区每天就有七十六万人投入积肥活动，占劳动力总数的30％。湖南省目前投入生产高潮的劳动力近一千一百万人，占全省劳动力总数的90％以上。到11月20日，已经积肥十一亿担，比去年同期多六亿担；各种计划已完成95％，比去年同期多二百五十九万亩。此外，北方各省区都正在扩大冬灌，南方各省都正在扩大冬种。许多地区已经制订了先进的生产规划，决心提前超额完成全国农业发展纲要修正草案规定的增产指标。整个农村充满了蓬勃的革命朝气。
    为了使农业生产建设运动健康地发展下去，目前应当注意的是：既要继续反对盲目的保守，也要反对盲目的空喊。只有规划而没有行动是无用的，规划很大很高而具体措施很少很空也是无用的。任何时候都要深入调查，依靠群众，实事求是，脚踏实地。生产规划应该充满积极的进取的精神，也应该适当地留下机动的余地，让干部和群众有信心超过它，而不致在遭到意外的困难的时候挫伤积极性。还应当注意，农业生产的大跃进，要靠多方面的努力；要把长远的利益同目前的利益适当地结合起来。为了给明年的农业生产筹备更多的资金，为了解决部分灾区农民的生活困难问题，都有必要把冬季副业生产开展起来。对于保护和繁殖耕畜的工作和其它各项春耕准备工作，对于冬季作物的田间管理，都不可忽视。
    为了使社会主义制度更加巩固，还有一些重大问题必须解决。在农业社的干部作风、干群关系、经营管理工作、财务分配工作等等方面，都还待大力整顿和改进。这就是说，必须按照9月14日中共中央发布的关于整顿农业生产合作社、关于做好农业合作社生产管理工作、关于在农业合作社内部贯彻执行互利政策等三项指示，对农业社进行一系列的整顿工作。也就是说，应该像目前大部分工厂、机关、学校已经做的那样，把农村的整风运动也转入以整改为主的阶段。
    目前，在大部分地区，以粮食问题为中心的关于农村两条道路的大辩论已经告一段落。虽然还有相当一部分地区还没有放透辩透，还处于“夹生”状态，但是从总的形势看来，逆流已经扭转，社会秩序已经更加稳定。在这情况下，有可能也有必要把斗争的锋芒转向我们自己工作中的缺点和错误，“引火烧身”，把不利于农业社和生产运动健康发展的东西都“烧”个净光。只有这样，才能使大规模的生产运动更有力地开展，同时也能使全民性的整风运动更深入地进行。有些地方在前一个时期没有鸣透放透，现在正好同整社运动结合起来，再次发动大鸣大放。这样，就可以使群众把更多的意见提出来，以便“择其善者而从之”。目前，一般地说，应该集中力量抓整顿作风、整顿组织、改进工作、改进生产。在这次大鸣大放中，仍然可能有人提出不正确的意见。如果这些意见是同整社和当前生产有密切关系，必须立即解决的，可以在不误生产和整社而且有利生产和整社的条件下进行辩论。至于一般的思想问题，就不必急于在目前争辩，而可以留到稍后一个时期再展开大辩论。
    要用正确的态度对待我们工作中存在的缺点和错误。绝大部分农业社才办了两年，在这两年里，由于缺少经验，有些地方在一些工作中的确碰到了一些困难，也出了一些毛病。当然，从这里决不能得出这样的结论：既然缺少有经验的干部，就不该一下子办这么多社，这样做是“冒进”了。在两年生产中，在大灾小灾中，农业社经受了严酷的考验。事实早已证明，农业合作化不是什么“冒进了”而是健康的大跃进。两年前缺少经验，经过两年实践就增添了不少经验。从办社的优点和成绩中可以得到成功的经验，从缺点和错误中也可以得到失败的经验。成绩必须肯定；缺点必须克服。抹杀办社的成绩，就会使我们迷失方向、丧失信心，这对社会主义事业是极为不利的；只有社会主义的敌人才故意抹杀农业社的成就。讳言办社的缺点，就会使我们疾病缠身、行动无力，这对社会主义事业也是极为不利的；也只有社会主义的敌人才喜欢我们有缺点而不克服。许多事实已经说明了，正是由于办社工作还有缺点，才使地主、富农、反革命、坏分子有机可乘，使资本主义思想特别严重的人有空子可钻。这些都说明了整顿农业社是多么重要的一件事。整社，正是发扬优点、巩固成绩、克服缺点、纠正错误、总结经验、提高干部、加强团结、推进工作的最好的方法。中共中央多次指示，整社工作每年都要进行一次。今年，决不可以因为别的工作繁忙而让这项工作滑过去，而应该按照正确处理人民内部矛盾的原则，把整社工作做得更好。
    靠谁整顿农业合作社呢？同前一阶段的整风运动一样，必须坚决地依靠群众的大多数。首先要放手发动群众在大会小会上或在个别谈心时畅所欲言，对于干部的缺点或错误提出批评，把工作中的缺点和问题无遗地揭露出来。然后，组织有群众代表参加的小型会议，查清事实，分清责任。批评得对的，就由应负责任的人当众检讨，切实改正；群众误会的，就列举事实，解释清楚；应该系统地加以改进的，就同群众一起研究改进方案；应该严肃地加以处理的，就同群众一起研究处理办法。在群众性的批评和自我批评的基础上整社，同时整党、整团，这是改进工作、提高干部、加强党团组织的战斗力的“又多又快又好又省”的方法。只有这样，才能使干部的头脑高度地清醒，才能使工作的缺点彻底地消除，才能使党群关系和干群关系最迅速地改善，才能使思想水平和工作能力最有效地提高。不少地方的经验已经证明，有许多在平时长期不能解决的问题，在群众性的整社运动中很快就解决了，解决得又彻底又省力。要依靠大多数群众，就要相信大多数群众。当然，也要相信大多数乡社干部。目前，对于采用群众性的批评和自我批评的方式来整社，在乡社干部中和群众中都还有一些思想障碍。整社工作组首先要帮助乡社干部消除思想障碍，使他们相信党，相信群众。要使他们了解发动群众参加整社的必要性，不要怕群众“过火”，要相信绝大多数群众是热爱社会主义的，是能够分清是非的；不要怕“丢面子”，只有改正了缺点和错误才能真正保住自己的“面子”；不要怕把社“放垮”，只有让社员群众把意见都讲出来才有利于社的巩固。先向乡社干部和党员团员说明这些道理，使他们精神上有所准备，他们就能够用正确的态度对待整社工作、对待群众提出的意见。有些社员怕“报复”，怕“得罪人”，怕提了意见也“不顶事”。为了打破这些思想障碍，需要由工作组向群众讲明党的政策，讲明处理人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾是完全不同的两回事，还需要由乡社干部向群众恳切地明确地表明改进工作、整顿作风的态度和决心。更重要的是实际行动，要在一开始就正确对待群众提出的意见，凡是很快就能改正的就要坚决地边整边改。只要这样做，群众参加整社的积极性很快就会高涨起来。
    目前正是兴修农田水利、积肥和其他冬季生产活动最紧张的时候，同时又要围绕着农业发展纲要修正草案开展关于农业生产建设的大辩论，制定生产计划，又要整社、整党、整团，工作应该怎么安排呢？这些工作的确每一项都是十分重要的，决不可把任何一项挤掉。这就要求各级党委加强领导，在时间上恰当地安排，在工作上密切地结合。要同时都做好是相当紧张的，但决不是不可能的。讨论农业发展纲要修正草案和整社都可以放在晚上进行，不要占用白天的生产时间。一般地说，可以把讨论纲要当作整社的第一步（按照中共中央关于整社的指示，讨论农业发展纲要修正草案、制定生产规划正是整社工作的一个重要部分）。这用七个到十个晚上的时间也就够了。在逐条讨论纲要、逐项制定规划中间，必然会涉及农业社的生产管理、积累和分配、经营方针、干部作风等方面的问题；特别是纲要的第一条，正是“巩固农业合作制度”，同整社更有直接的关系。在讨论纲要之后，自然而然地可以转入全面整社——大鸣大放，边整边改。至于制定生产规划的工作，如果过去已有较充分的准备，就可以在讨论纲要中间同时做好；过去没有充分准备的，也不妨在整改期间穿插进行。
    大鸣大放，边整边改，只要掌握得好，决不会妨碍生产。恰恰相反，这样做可以大大推进生产。凡是已经实行了大鸣大放边整边改的农业社，生产就进行得格外有劲。这是因为干部作风转变了，劳动组织合理了，生产阻力消除了，群众也更热爱自己的集体的事业了。河南省今年抗旱种麦工作做得很好，正因为这项工作是在发动群众大鸣大放大争之中进行的。在鸣放辩论中，解决了天旱究竟能不能种麦的思想问题，也促使干部改进了工作方法和作风，发扬了群众的智慧，发动了群众的力量。越是放得透改得快的地方，生产劲头越高。许多事实说明，只要把整社和生产密切结合起来，甚至在农事最繁忙的季节也可以做好整社工作。
    现在，在广大农村，应该大张旗鼓地普遍深入地向社员群众和乡社干部宣传、讲解中共中央9月14日发布的关于整顿农业合作社的三项指示。前一个时期，在许多地方，因为正在紧张地进行以粮食等问题为中心的大辩论和秋收秋种粮食征购等工作，没有来得及在三项指示发布以后用足够的力量向广大群众宣传。现在是时候了。应当了解，这三个指示是发动群众大鸣大放推进农村整风运动的最有力的武器。这些指示集中了广大群众的要求；再把它们交给广大群众掌握起来，就会产生出来巨大的力量，使农业合作制度更加巩固，使农业生产建设更加繁荣。
