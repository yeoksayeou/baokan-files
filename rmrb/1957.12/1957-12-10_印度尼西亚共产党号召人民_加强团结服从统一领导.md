　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 9th. The Politburo of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party issued a statement on the West Irian issue on the 8th.
    The statement pointed out that all forces within Indonesia tend to realize the "other path" pointed out by the government to solve the West Irian issue outside the United Nations. The statement called on the Indonesian people to strengthen unity and obey unified leadership in the struggle to recover West Irian. Contradictions that may arise in the struggle against Dutch colonialism should be resolved through consultation.
    The statement pointed out that the economic power of Dutch colonialists should be paralyzed through struggle, and the economic resources they control should belong to the Republic of Indonesia.
    The statement said that the Netherlands is currently facing two paths. The first path is that if the Netherlands is prepared to negotiate with Indonesia on the return of West Irian under the auspices of the United Nations, then the taken-over Dutch enterprises may be compensated according to Indonesia's ability and conditions. The second path is that if the Netherlands stubbornly refuses to return West Irian, the taken-over enterprises will be confiscated and Dutch capitalists will not receive any compensation.
    The statement said that so far, the Indonesian government has not yet decided whether to nationalize or confiscate the Dutch enterprises that have been taken over, which shows that the Indonesian government is giving the Netherlands an opportunity to deeply consider this issue and return West Irian to Indonesia.
    The statement also pointed out that the actions of the Indonesian people are only directed at Dutch big capitalists. As long as the big capitalists of other imperialist countries do not take a hostile attitude towards the Republic of Indonesia in the dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands, the actions of the Indonesian people are not directed at them.

　  印度尼西亚共产党号召人民
　　加强团结服从统一领导
    新华社雅加达9日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局在8日就西伊里安问题发表了一项声明。
    声明指出，印度尼西亚国内的一切力量都倾向于实现政府所指出的在联合国以外解决西伊里安问题的“另一条道路”。声明呼吁印度尼西亚人民在收复西伊里安的斗争中加强团结，服从统一领导。在同荷兰殖民主义者进行斗争中可能发生的矛盾应当通过协商来解决。
    声明指出，应该通过斗争使荷兰殖民主义者的经济力量归于瘫痪，使他们掌握的经济富源归印度尼西亚共和国所有。
    声明说，目前荷兰面对着两条道路。第一条道路是，假如荷兰准备在联合国的赞助下同印度尼西亚就归还西伊里安问题进行谈判，那么被接管的荷兰企业就可能按照印度尼西亚的能力和条件得到赔偿。第二条道路是，假如荷兰仍旧顽固地拒绝交还西伊里安，那么被接管的企业就将被没收，荷兰资本家将得不到任何赔偿。
    声明说，到现在为止，印度尼西亚政府还没有决定是要把已经接管的荷兰企业收归国有还是予以没收，这表明印度尼西亚政府给予荷兰深入地考虑这个问题的机会，把西伊里安交还印度尼西亚。
    声明还指出，印度尼西亚人民的行动只针对荷兰的大资本家。其他帝国主义国家的大资本家只要在印度尼西亚同荷兰的争端中不对印度尼西亚共和国采取敌对态度，印度尼西亚人民的行动就不是针对他们的。
