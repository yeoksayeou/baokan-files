Xinhua News Agency Report: Is it better to plan for the long-term interests of the cooperative and have members' income subordinate to the development of production? Or is it better to only care about members being able to divide more in the short term and relax investment in production? The contrasting facts of the Hongqi (Red Flag) No. 3 Cooperative and the No. 2 Cooperative in Dajue Township, Jingjiang County, provide a powerful answer.

The Hongqi No. 3 Cooperative originally had poor soil and water conservancy conditions. Only one-tenth of the cooperative's cultivated land was relatively good flat land, and the rest was uneven sandy soil and hardpan soil. Before the cooperative was established, one mu of wheat could yield seven dou, and one mu of cotton could yield fifty jin (seed cotton), even in a good year. Since the establishment of the cooperative two years ago, in accordance with the spirit of "cooperative first, family second; developing production first to improve life," the members have saved on food and clothing, worked diligently, overcome various difficulties, and fully invested in water conservancy construction and land reclamation. The masses put forward the action slogan "If you want to turn poverty into wealth, you must first improve the soil and water," vigorously carried out land leveling, ditching and water diversion, starting early and working late, and working hard. Before the summer planting last year, they completed the task of converting 290 mu of dry land into paddy fields, resulting in a miracle of a bumper harvest in a disaster year. This year, the members saved on food and clothing, added water pumps, greatly solved the difficulty of insufficient labor during the busy farming season, completed the task of converting 300 mu of dry land into paddy fields according to plan, and actively accumulated fertilizer, implemented close planting, and controlled pests. The average annual yield of grain per mu in the cooperative reached more than 740 jin (the unit yield of rice was 616 jin), and the unit yield exceeded the output of the local wealthy middle peasants by more than double. The unit yield of cotton also reached 150 jin. Due to the big leap forward in production, the lives of the members have also improved year after year.

The Hongqi No. 2 Cooperative is adjacent to the No. 3 Cooperative, and the labor force, draught animals, fields, and time of establishment are similar. The water conservancy and soil quality of the No. 2 Cooperative were originally better than those of the No. 3 Cooperative. However, this year the unit yield of grain per mu in the No. 2 Cooperative was 161 jin less than that of the No. 3 Cooperative, and the yield of cotton per mu was 48 jin less. The average income per mu of land was 16 yuan less than that of the No. 3 Cooperative, and the income per household was more than 90 yuan less.

Why is it that two cooperatives with originally similar conditions have such different yields and incomes? It turns out that the leadership of the No. 2 Cooperative only wanted the members to divide more in the short term and have fewer burdens, and neglected the cooperative's production investment and expanded reproduction. Last year, even the national loan of 3,000 yuan was distributed to the members, and there was no accumulation of funds within the cooperative. On major production measures such as water conservancy construction and land reclamation, there were many concerns, fearing that the investment would be large and the burden on the members would be heavy, so they were hesitant to do anything. In the past two years, the No. 3 Cooperative has converted nearly 600 mu of dry land into paddy fields, while the No. 2 Cooperative has only converted 50 mu, and 400 mu of leaking fields have not been cured. They are unwilling to invest in adding water pumps, which are urgently needed for production. As a result, although production is also busy, the yield increases very slowly. For example, during the busy season last year, all the labor force of the No. 2 Cooperative was unable to draw water for the 400 mu of leaking fields, so it was impossible to refine and cultivate and improve technology; the cooperative's annual waterwheel repair cost is nearly 1,000 yuan, which is not cheaper than using a water pump, but a lot of manpower is used, and there is no time to accumulate fertilizer.

Recently, the No. 2 Cooperative has summed up the contrast, criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking in production, corrected the correct relationship between developing production and improving life, and is determined to use the spirit of diligence and thrift in running the cooperative to strive to catch up with the level of the No. 3 Cooperative in one or two years. On the basis of initial achievements, the No. 3 Cooperative is also preparing to continue to strive for a great leap forward in agriculture.

    两个农业社条件相同生产两样
    扩大公共积累的社大踏步走在前头
    光顾社员眼前利益的社只能跟在后面
    本报讯  据新华日报报道：为社的长远利益打算，社员的收入服从于发展生产好呢？还是只顾眼前社员能多分些，放松生产上的投资好呢？靖江县大觉乡红旗三社和二社的事实对比给了有力答复。
    红旗三社原来土质水利条件都差，全社耕地面积中只有十分之一较好的平田，其余都是高低不平的飞沙土和板沙土。办社前，一亩小麦能收到七斗，一亩棉花能收到五十斤（籽棉），就算是丰年了。建社两年来，该社根据“先社后家、先发展生产才能提高生活”的精神，社员们省吃俭用，勤劳生产，克服各种困难，全力投入修水利和旱改水运动。群众提出“要得穷变富，先得改水土”的行动口号，大力进行平田整地、开沟引水，起早带晚，埋头苦干，在去年夏种前完成了二百九十亩田的旱改水任务，出现了灾年丰收的奇迹。今年社员省吃俭用，添置了抽水机，大大解决了农忙时劳力不足的困难，按计划完成了三百亩田旱改水任务，并积极积肥、实行密植、治虫等，全社平均每亩粮食年产量达到七百四十斤以上（水稻单位产量六百一十六斤），单位产量超过当地富裕中农的产量一倍以上，棉花单位产量也达到一百五十斤。由于生产上大踏步前进，社员们的生活也连年改善。
    红旗二社和三社相邻，劳力、耕畜、田亩和办社时间都差不多，二社的水利和土质原比三社还好些。但今年二社的粮食每亩单位产量要比三社少收一百六十一斤，棉花每亩少收四十八斤。平均每亩田的收入要比三社少十六元，每户的收入要少九十多元。
    为什么两个原来条件差不多的社，产量和收入却相差很多呢？原来二社领导思想上，只图社员眼前能多分些，负担少些，忽视了社里生产投资和扩大再生产。去年连国家贷款都分掉三千元给社员用，社内资金毫无积累。在兴修水利和旱改水等生产重大措施上，顾虑多端，怕投资多，社员负担重，缩手缩脚不敢搞。两年来，三社旱改水近六百亩，而二社仅仅改五十亩，四百亩漏水田也未根治好，生产上极需的抽水机也不愿投资添置。结果虽然生产上也忙忙碌碌，但产量却增加很慢。如去年大忙时，二社全部劳力为四百亩漏田车水都来不及，也就没有可能再去精耕细作和改进技术；该社每年水车修理费近千元，并不比用抽水机便宜，人力却用了许多，也抽不出空去积肥。
    最近二社已通过总结对比，批判了生产上的右倾保守思想，端正了发展生产与改善生活之间的正确关系，决心用勤俭办社的精神，争取在一两年中产量赶上三社的水平。三社也准备在取得初步成绩基础上，继续争取农业大跃进。
