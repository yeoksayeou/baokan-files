　　Greatly Increase Production Internship Time
    Soviet Union Tries Out New Secondary School Teaching Plan
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 14th. To strengthen labor technical education for middle school students and bring school education closer to life, the Soviet Union has begun to pilot a new teaching plan in fifty secondary schools.

    Since most Soviet middle school graduates will participate in production in the future, the characteristic of the new teaching plan is to greatly increase the time for students' production internships. The new teaching plan stipulates that senior middle school students spend half of their total study time on production internships in factories, collective farms, farms, and machine tractor stations. Ninth and tenth grade students in urban middle schools only attend classes three days a week, and spend the rest of their time participating in labor production. Students in rural schools mainly attend classes in winter and participate in agricultural labor at other times.

    The new teaching plan fully preserves the past courses, but the overall teaching time will be extended by one or two years accordingly, i.e., from ten years to eleven or twelve years.

    During students' production internships, workers, technicians, and engineers will serve as instructors. In addition to general exams in school, students will also undergo labor technical exams. After graduation, students can stay and work in the units where they interned or go to work positions suitable for their technical level.

　　大大增加生产实习时间
    苏联试行新的中学教学计划
    新华社莫斯科14日电　为了加强对中学生的劳动技术教育，使学校教育和生活更加接近，苏联已经开始在五十所中等学校中试行新的教学计划。
    由于今后苏联的大部分中学毕业生都将参加生产，新教学计划的特点是大大增加学生生产实习的时间。新教学计划规定，中学高年级学生在工厂、农庄、农场、机器拖拉机站进行生产实习的时间占总学习时间的一半。城市中学九年级和十年级学生每周只上三天课，其余时间参加劳动生产。农村学校的学生主要是在冬季上课，其它时间参加农业劳动。
    在新教学计划中，完全保存了过去的课程，但是整个教学时间要相应地延长一年或两年，即从十年改为十一年或十二年。
    在学生进行生产实习时，将由工人、技师、工程师来担任指导教师。学生除了参加学校中一般的考试外，还要经过劳动技术考试。学生在毕业后可以留在他们实习的单位工作或者到适合于他们的技术水平的工作岗位上去。
