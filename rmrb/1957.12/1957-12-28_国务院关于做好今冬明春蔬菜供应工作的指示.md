    State Council's Instructions on Ensuring Vegetable Supply This Winter and Next Spring
    In 1957, vegetable production in most parts of China saw significant development. In thirty-seven large and medium-sized cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Harbin, the vegetable planting area increased by 8% and the yield increased by 17% compared to 1956. Significant achievements were also made in autumn vegetable storage across various regions. Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Lanzhou, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and other places alone stored over 1.9 billion jin of vegetables. These achievements laid a good material foundation for ensuring vegetable supply this winter and next spring. Since the autumn vegetables came on the market, the vegetable supply in cities and industrial and mining areas has improved to varying degrees compared to the same period last year, and prices have also decreased, generally by about 15%. However, it must also be recognized that some problems still exist in the vegetable supply work this winter and next spring: some regions failed to complete their autumn vegetable planting plans in 1957. The original plan for the twelve provinces and cities in the north was to expand the autumn vegetable area by 400,000 mu in 1957, but only 257,000 mu were actually completed; some areas also suffered disasters, and Heilongjiang Province alone saw a reduction of 200 million jin of autumn vegetables compared to the original plan. The amount of autumn vegetables stored in 1957 was larger than in the past, and many units lacked storage experience. In some areas, the temperature was relatively high when the autumn vegetables were put into cellars, which further increased the difficulties in storage work. Currently, the loss rate of some vegetable cellars has reached 30%, which is much higher than the normal loss rate. Some areas have not made comprehensive plans for the vegetable supply this winter and next spring. The current supply quantity is too large, and there is a lack of reliable arrangements for the supply before the new spring vegetables come on the market next spring. There is also a great deal of waste in vegetable consumption in many areas, such as some residents throwing away the outer leaves of cabbage and peeling potatoes and radishes, which wastes about 15% of the vegetables. In order to ensure vegetable supply this winter and next spring, the State Council hereby issues the following instructions:
    1.  Vegetable production is highly seasonal, especially in the north. Therefore, making good seasonal adjustments is an important part of ensuring vegetable supply. The People's Committees of all cities and industrial and mining areas should immediately conduct an inspection of the vegetable supply work this winter and next spring and make comprehensive arrangements for the vegetable supply this winter and next spring based on the existing supply situation. In the current situation where the vegetable supply cannot fully meet the needs of residents, it is necessary to conduct extensive publicity and education among residents and mobilize the masses to save vegetables. Vegetable operating departments should make a complete plan for the vegetable supply work this winter and next spring and organize the operation and management work according to the plan; and should appropriately control the adjustment and supply of tofu, bean sprouts, and various pickled and dried vegetables according to seasonal needs.
    2.  The quantity of autumn vegetables stored this year is relatively large, and they must be well preserved. Otherwise, it will not only affect the income of the masses and the enthusiasm of government agencies and organizations for storing vegetables, but also bring great difficulties to the market supply in the coming spring. Therefore, the People's Committees of all localities should organize special personnel to regularly inspect the vegetable storage situation, supervise and guide the vegetable storage departments to take timely measures such as ventilation, restacking, and spraying to avoid or reduce spoilage and losses.
    3.  Judging from the production and sales of vegetables this year, the growth of vegetable production in many cities and industrial and mining areas still cannot meet the growing needs of residents' consumption. Therefore, when arranging the vegetable production plan for 1958, all localities should carefully calculate the residents' needs, fully estimate the impact of climate on production, and take possible disaster factors into account. Sufficient land area must be reserved for vegetables. If the stored vegetables in some areas really cannot guarantee the supply during the lean season next spring, they should immediately start preparing to sow a certain amount of fast-growing vegetables next spring.
    4.  In order to ensure the vegetable supply in cities and industrial and mining areas, some vegetable-producing provinces should ensure the completion of the vegetable transfer plan.
    Vegetables are an indispensable non-staple food for every household every day and have a very close relationship with the people's lives. The People's Committees of all provinces, autonomous regions,and municipalities should strengthen their leadership over this work and urge all relevant departments to do a good job in the supply, storage, transportation, processing, and arrangement of next year's vegetable production and other specific tasks.

### 国务院关于做好今冬明春蔬菜供应工作的指示

    国务院关于做好今冬明春蔬菜供应工作的指示
    一九五七年我国大部分地区的蔬菜生产有了很大的发展。北京、天津、上海、沈阳、哈尔滨等三十七个大、中城市一九五七年蔬菜的播种面积比一九五六年增加了百分之八，产量则增加了百分之十七。各地秋菜的贮存工作也取得了很大的成绩，仅北京、天津、石家庄、兰州、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、内蒙古、山西等地就储存了十九亿多斤。这些就为做好今冬明春的蔬菜供应工作打下了良好的物质基础。自从秋菜上市以来，城市和工矿区的蔬菜供应，比之去年同期已经有了不同程度的改善，价格也比去年同期有了下降，下降幅度一般在百分之十五左右。但是，也必须看到，今冬明春的蔬菜供应工作还存在一些问题：有些地区一九五七年的秋菜播种计划没有完成，北方十二个省市原定一九五七年扩大秋菜面积四十万亩，实际只完成了二十五点七万亩；部分地区还有灾害，仅黑龙江省秋菜就比原计划减产二亿斤。一九五七年秋菜的储存数量比过去较大，加以不少单位缺乏保管经验，有些地区在秋菜入窖的时候，气温又比较高，更增加了储存工作中的困难，目前有的菜窖损耗率已达百分之三十，超过正常损耗率很多。有的地区对今冬明春的蔬菜供应没有作好全面的规划，目前的供应数量过多，对明年春季新菜上市以前的供应则缺乏可靠的安排。许多地区在蔬菜的消费方面还有很大的浪费，如有些居民吃白菜去帮，吃土豆、萝卜去皮，这样大约要浪费百分之十五左右的蔬菜。为了做好今冬明春的蔬菜供应工作，国务院特作如下指示：
    一、蔬菜生产的季节性很大，尤其是北方更大，因此，作好季节性的调剂是作好蔬菜供应工作的重要一环。各个城市和工矿区的人民委员会对今冬明春的蔬菜供应工作应该立即进行一次检查，根据现有的货源情况对今冬明春的蔬菜供应全面地加以安排，在目前蔬菜供应还不能充分满足居民需要的情况下，必须对居民进行广泛的宣传教育，发动群众节约吃菜。蔬菜经营部门应该把今冬明春的蔬菜供应工作，做出全部计划，根据计划组织好经营管理工作；并应根据季节需要，适当掌握豆腐、豆芽以及各种腌、干菜的调剂供应。
    二、今年秋菜贮存的数量较大，必须很好地加以保管，否则，不仅会影响群众的收入，影响机关、团体存菜的积极性，而且还会给来年春季的市场供应带来很大的困难。因此，各地人民委员会都应该组织专人对蔬菜的储存情况，经常地进行检查，督促和指导各存菜部门及时采取通风、倒垛、喷药等措施，以避免或减少腐烂和损失。
    三、从今年蔬菜的产销情况看来，许多城市、工矿区蔬菜生产的增长还满足不了居民消费增长的需要。因此，各地在布置一九五八年蔬菜生产计划的时候，要很好地计算居民的需要量，还要充分估计到气候对生产的影响，把可能的灾害因素考虑在内，必须给蔬菜留出足够的土地面积。如果有些地区的存菜，确实不能保证明春青黄不接时期的供应，就应该立即着手准备在明年春季播种一定数量的快熟蔬菜。
    四、为了保证城市、工矿区的蔬菜供应，一些产菜省分，应该保证蔬菜外调计划的完成。
    蔬菜为家家户户每天必不可缺少的一种副食品，同人民的生活有着很密切的关系。各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会要加强对这一工作的领导，并督促各有关部门作好蔬菜的供应、储存、调运、加工和明年蔬菜生产的安排等各项具体工作。
                国务院
            一九五七年十二月二十七日
