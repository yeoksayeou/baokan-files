"The Honeybee Collects Flowers Bitterly, but the Honey is Fragrant and Sweet" (Note 1)
——Literary Appreciation Essays
　　Wang Chaowen
    The posthumous works of the painter Qi Baishi will be exhibited at the Soviet Exhibition Center on January 1, 1958. Including precious poetry manuscripts and painting drafts that have never been seen by the general public, the exhibits include more than seven hundred pieces of paintings, calligraphy, seals, and manuscripts. The most prominent common feature of these many different styles and genres of works is their simple, profound, and natural style, just like the painter's own character.

    The earliest work on display is a carp painted at about the age of twenty. Simple and unadorned, meticulous in every stroke, it shows the true nature of a serious woodcarver (Qi Baishi was a woodcarver at this time). The strengths of folk art are clearly manifested in the works of this period and continue to be preserved in the works of subsequent periods.

    The landscape painting "Borrowing Mountain Scenery" is a series of paintings created by him in his hometown of Hunan at the age of forty-seven after traveling through half of China. Like his other landscape painting series "Twenty-Four Scenes of Stone Gate," the brush and ink are not as mature as in his mature period, but they have already initially shown his unique personal style. As the painter said in his "Preface to the Poetry Draft," during this period, "although the poetic realm expands, I feel the difficulty of writing poetry even more." Because he strives to accurately express what he sees and feels, even if the images are not yet fully mature, their fresh spirit is far beyond that of painters with sweet and熟熟 brushes and inks.

    Around the age of fifty-seven or eight, Qi Baishi's painting skills had matured. The brush and ink are refined, the shapes are simple, the subject matter is wide, and the expressive methods are diverse. The composition of some works becomes very lively, not completely maintaining a cold and detached taste. Bold use of strong colors to paint flowers, and also using ink and wash together. The pursuit of formal beauty is closely related to the depiction of certain aspects of the object. All his efforts do not depart from the requirement of highlighting the characteristics of the object, so whether it is landscape, figures, flowers, or insects, there are outstanding aspects. The old painter, who already possesses rich creative experience, harmoniously unifies subjective requirements with objective characteristics. Old Man Baishi does not consider meticulous detail as skill, pays attention to the changes in brush and ink, and at the same time requires these changes to conform to "Heaven" (nature, reality):

    The brush in landscape painting should use both skill and clumsiness. Skillful means clever and changeable, clumsy means simple and ancient, in accordance with Heaven. The creations of Heaven have no disease of frivolity or turbidity.
        (Excerpt from "Old Ping Poetry Draft" 1919)

    Based on reality and constantly exploring new expressions in form, forming a unity of image truth and beauty, creating realms that others cannot imagine, and obtaining a style that is different from others but not pretentious.

    The peach forest that stretches like a long red cloud along the riverbank, the mountain village shrouded in misty rain that makes people feel the chill, the crows circling the forest painted in just a few strokes but appearing very lively, the northern willow trees that stand proudly against the cold wind despite not being tall and straight, the sailboats floating lightly on the vast river like birds, a group of grazing water buffalo appearing through the sparse peach forest, the solitary but self-assured hill standing in the heart of the river, the quiet dwelling like "no startled sparrows around the house in the deep forest" (Note 2)... These landscape paintings with fresh styles do not fall into the clichés of predecessors and are very natural. It makes people feel that: rather than being painted for others to see, it is simply that the painter has simply recorded his own deep feelings. The painter constantly explores new realms and also possesses the feelings of ordinary people, satisfying his creative desires and also adapting to the requirements of the appreciators.

    The realm of Qi Baishi's works is inseparable from the feelings of the people. A young shepherd boy eager to return home pulls a large water buffalo that does not understand the shepherd boy's feelings and is slow to move forward. The picture is very simple, but it makes people deeply feel the painter's sincere feelings of nostalgia. The three children throwing firewood and playing are also a formalization of the painter's childhood memories. Readers certainly do not have the memories of Qi Baishi's childhood life, but these images may evoke similar memories. Because they are closely related to our lives, we feel close to them when we see them. A "Belated Night Reading Picture" that was not exhibited in time is also a good work from this period of the old man. The child who could not resist the torment of the "sleep bug" and fell asleep on the desk is not just the painter's memoir.

    Qi Baishi expresses the beautiful things in nature in an approachable way, so children also like his works. A seven-year-old child had the opportunity to see photos of the works exhibited this time and was deeply attracted by the painting of a group of cormorants standing on a sandbar, watching intently. I asked him if he liked this painting. He began by using the words "I don't know" to perfunctorily answer. After staying a little longer, he said that he liked the birds: "They are playing." Although he could not even name the type of these birds, did not understand how the basic shapes of the cormorants were intricately organized together to form the momentum of the cormorants, did not understand how much hard study was required to paint a vivid bird with just one stroke, let alone that he did not care about the blank spaces and inked areas of the picture and what principles the layout of the signature and seal was based on, he was able to know what the painter liked and therefore focused on expressing without any explanation, just by intuition.

    Moving images are not easy to come by. Even very simple strokes have undergone painstaking management. Many drafts not only demonstrate the painter's talent but also demonstrate the hardship of painting. The back of a very interesting draft from 1919 contains the painter's hard work. A few strokes painted a very vivid bird, and a few words were inscribed to explain the origin of this image. He said that on June 18th, he was chatting with a student at Fayuan Temple in Beijing when he saw that the white stone slurry on the brick ground looked just like a bird, so he used a brush to draw it on the spot and felt that it "really had a natural interest." Obviously, this accidental phenomenon contains a non-accidental reason. It is not that anyone can see a vivid image of a bird from the marks on the ground. It is not something that ordinary people with good luck encounter, but rather something that Qi Baishi discovered who is always concerned with the creation of images. If artists have a special sensitivity, this sensitivity is not mysterious, but it is still inseparable from the painter's daily observation and thought efforts.

    Even in his later years, Qi Baishi was not satisfied with his existing achievements and always strived to pursue novel creations. The works of his later years are not only more experienced in brush and ink and more unrestrained in composition, but also the conception of some works is ingenious and completely unexpected. Everyone has repeatedly talked about "Frog Sounds Ten Miles Out of the Mountain Spring," which is undoubtedly a negation of those who believe that as long as you create an article from a title, you will definitely produce a formulaic inferior product. The lotus flower painted in 1952, with tadpoles chasing the reflection of the lotus flower on the water, completely broke through the boundaries between plastic art and poetry, providing a model for bold creation for those who can only sketch from life and dare not give free rein to their imagination. The reflection of the lotus flower is seen by people; can the tadpoles living in the water see the lotus flower and its reflection? Is this divorced from reality? The painter is not constrained by prejudice, is not afraid of violating natural science, and dares to use this semi-true and semi-false scene to express the childishness of living things and also embodies his love for the beautiful aspects of the object. This is not a crude report, not a bland narrative, and certainly not a trivial explanation, but an emotional chant.

    A painting note in the manuscript "Gengshen Diary" can also show his awareness as an artist: "Some say that my painting of Guanyin Bodhisattva, why is it beautiful and solemn? I say: You must know that the Bodhisattva is my heart." Not regarded as a superstitious idol, but regarded as a concentrated expression of beauty and goodness, the painter does not only paint what he sees, but also what he feels, and even what he dreams. In order to prevent photographyism in artistic creation, Qi Baishi's works, which do not directly depict major social events, should also be appreciated as models.

    Bold creation is a concrete manifestation of the noble qualities of the Chinese people. There are many passionate remarks against imitation in Qi Baishi's manuscripts. The inscription on Chen Hongshou's (Mansheng) engraved seal rubbing in 1921 shows his awareness and confidence as an artist. In engraving, the seal script has a unique natural interest that surpasses others, namely the people of Qin and Han. The people of Qin and Han had outstanding qualities, all in being not stupid, daring to create independently, so they could surpass the ages. My engraving does not adhere to the ropes and ink of predecessors, but people think that there is no basis. I often lament the stupidity of the people of the time, not knowing that the people of Qin and Han are also children of people, and we are also children of people. If you don't think that we have unique points, if the ancients saw it, they would also admire it. Mr. Mansheng's engraving is good in that he did not die imitating the pseudo-copper seals of the people of Qin and Han, and was willing to be stupid. (Excerpt from "Xinyou Diary") In the "Gengshen Diary," Old Man Baishi recorded his respect for the ancients and also foresaw his future achievements in daring to create.

    The paintings of Qing Teng, Xue Ge, and Da Dizhi can be painted horizontally and vertically, and I admire them extremely. I regret not being born three hundred years ago, or asking to grind ink and tidy paper for you. If you do not accept me, I will starve outside the door and not leave, which is also a happy thing. I think that the future will look at the present, just as the present looks at the past; I regret that I cannot know it.

    The facts after the national liberation proved that Qi Baishi's predictions did not fail, and even far exceeded his predictions. After the national liberation, when he was still alive, he received the supreme honor that Chinese painters of all ages had never received.

    Qi Baishi's achievements relied on the achievements of his predecessors and also on his selfless labor. Just like the painters Huang Binhong and Xu Beihong, whose works are also exhibited this time, they worked diligently throughout their lives and left a brilliant spiritual wealth for future generations. The posthumous works exhibition of Old Man Baishi is not just a profound aesthetic education for people.

    “采花蜂苦蜜芳甜”（注一）
    ——文艺欣赏随笔
  　王朝闻
    画家齐白石的遗作，将于1958年1月1日在苏联展览馆展出。包括从来没有和广大群众见过面的珍贵的诗稿和画稿，展品有画、字、印和手稿共七百余件。这许多不同样式和体裁的作品，最显著的共同的特色，是格调纯朴，深厚，自然，正如画家自己的性格那样。
    展出的作品，最早的是大约二十岁时画的鲤鱼。朴实无华，一笔不苟，显示着认真的雕花木工（这时期齐白石是雕花木工）的本色。民间艺术的长处，分明表现在这一时期的作品之间，也继续保存在此后各个时期的作品之间。
    山水画“借山图”，是他游历了半个中国之后，四十七岁时在湖南故乡创造的组画。正如他的另一组山水画“石门廿四品”那样，笔墨不及成熟期纯熟，却已初步显示了他个人的独特风格。正如画家在他的“诗草自序”里所说，这一时期“虽诗境扩，益感作诗之难”。因为力求确切表现自己的所见和所感，即令形象还不大十分成熟，其新鲜的气概远远为笔墨甜熟的画家所不及。
    大约在五十七、八岁，齐白石的绘画技巧已经成熟了。笔墨洗练，造形单纯，题材范围广泛，表现方式多样。有些作品的构图变得很热闹，不完全保持冷逸的趣味。大胆使用了强烈的颜色来画花卉，而且和水墨并用。形式美的追求，和描写对象某些方面的特点密切联系着。他的一切努力不脱离突出对象特点的要求，因而不论山水、人物、花卉、草虫各方面，都有出众的地方。已经拥有丰富的创作经验的老画家，主观的要求与客观的特点和谐地统一着。白石老人不把平铺细抹算功夫，讲究笔墨的变化，同时又要求这些变化要合乎“天”（自然，现实）：
    山水笔要巧拙互用。巧则灵变，拙则浑古，合乎天。天之造物，自无轻佻混浊之病。
        （摘自1919“老萍诗草”）
    基于现实而又在表现形式上不断进行新的探索，形成形象的真与美的统一，构成别人想不到的境界，获得与众不同而又不矫揉造作的风格。
    漫长的红云一般横贯在河边的桃花林，使人感到寒意的被迷蒙的烟雨笼罩着的山村，不过几笔涂成却显得很热闹的绕林的寒鸦，虽不挺拔却昂然地迎着寒风的北方杨柳树，像鸟一般轻捷地浮游在渺远的江上的帆船，透过疏疏的桃林现出一群放牧的水牛，孤零地但又是自负地矗立在江心的小丘，“深林绕屋无惊雀”（注二）般幽静的居处……这些格调清新的山水画，不落前人窠臼而且十分自然。它使人觉得：与其说是画给别人看的，不如说无非是画家朴素地记录了自己深切的感受。画家不断探求新的境界而又具备了普通人的感情，满足了自己的创作欲，也适应了欣赏者的要求。
    齐白石作品的境界和人民的感情分不开。幼小的急于归家的牧童，拉着一条不懂得牧童心情、迟迟不前的大水牛，画面单纯得很，却使人深深感到画家怀旧的真挚感情。掷柴爬玩耍的三个小孩，也是画家童年回忆的造形化。读者当然不会具备齐白石童年生活的回忆，可是这些形象可能唤起类似的回忆。因为和我们的生活很有联系，我们看了感到亲切。有一幅没有来得及展出的“迟迟夜读图”，也是老人这一时期的好作品。那个抵抗不住“瞌睡虫”的折磨、伏在书桌上打瞌睡的孩子，何尝只是画家的回忆录。
    齐白石以平易近人的方式，表现了自然中的美好的东西，所以小孩也喜欢他的作品。一个七岁的孩子，有机会接触这次展出作品的照片，深被沙洲上站着一群鸬鹚那一幅画所吸引，聚精会神地观赏着。我问他喜不喜欢这幅画，开始是用“不知道”三个字来搪塞。多呆一会儿，他说出他对于鸟的好感：“他们正在玩儿”。尽管他连这一群鸟的名目也叫不出来，不懂得鸬鹚的基本形怎样错综地组织在一起而形成了鸬鹚的动势，不懂得一笔画成而又很传神的鸟需要多么艰苦的学习过程，更不用说他不关心画面的空白与着墨之处以及署名和盖印的布置依据什么原则，却能够不需要什么解释，只凭直觉知道画家喜欢的是什么，因而着重表现了什么。
    动人的形象不是容易得来的。即令是很简单的几笔，都经过苦心的经营。许多画稿不只表现了画家的才能，也表现了作画的艰苦。1919年的一幅很有趣的画稿的背面，包含着画家辛勤的劳动。几笔画了一只很生动的鸟，题了几句话说明这一形象的来历。他说他6月18日和一个学生在北京法源寺谈天，看见砖地上白色的石浆恰似一只鸟，于是用笔就地描画下来，觉得“真有天然之趣”。显然，这一偶然现象里包含着不偶然的原因。并不是任何人都可以从地上的斑痕看出生动的鸟的形象来的。出人意料地看见鸟的形象，不是运道很好的普通人碰见的。而是随时关心着形象的创造的齐白石发现出来的。如果说艺术家有一种特殊的敏感，这种敏感并不神秘，还是离不开画家日常观察和思索的努力。
    一直到晚年，齐白石不满足于既有的成就，总是努力追求新颖的创造。晚年的作品，不只是笔墨更加老练，构图更无拘束，而且有些作品的构思，妙想天开，完全出人意料。大家一再谈过的“蛙声十里出山泉”，不用说是对于那些以为凡是出题目做文章就一定产生公式化劣货的说法的否定。1952年画的那一幅荷花，蝌蚪追逐荷花水上倒影，完全突破了造形艺术与诗的界限，给只能写生不敢发挥想像的人提供了大胆创造的范例。荷花的倒影，是人看出来的；住在水里的蝌蚪，能看得见荷花与倒影吗？这样是不是脱离实际？画家不被成见所拘束，不怕违背自然科学，敢于借这种半真半假的景象表现生物的稚气，而且体现了自己对于对象的美妙方面的爱。这不是简陋的报道，不是平淡的叙述，更不是琐碎的解释，而是感情洋溢的吟唱。
    手稿“庚申日记”里的一条画记，也可以看出他那艺术家的自觉：“有谓余画观音大士，何以美丽而庄严？余曰：须知菩萨即吾心也”。不是当作一种迷信的偶像，而是当成一种美与善的集中表现的人的形象来看，画家不是只画其所见，而且要画其所感，以至要画他的理想。为了防止艺术创作中的摄影主义，并非直接描写重大的社会事件的齐白石的作品，也应该是当成模范来欣赏的。
    大胆创造是中国人民高贵品质的具体表现。齐白石的手稿里有许多反对因袭的激情的言论。1921年题陈鸿寿（曼生）刻印的拓片的题记，可以看得出作为艺术家的自觉和自信。刻印，其篆法别有天趣胜人者，维秦汉人。秦汉人有过人处，全在不蠢，胆敢独造，故能超出千古。余刻印，不拘前人绳墨，而人以为无所本。余尝哀时人之蠢，不知秦汉人，人子也，吾侪，亦人子也。不思吾侪有独到处，如令昔人见之，亦必倾佩。曼生先生之刻印，好在未死摹秦汉人伪铜印，甘自蠢耳。（摘自“辛酉日记”）在“庚申日记”里，白石老人记下他对古人的尊敬，也预见了敢于创造的自己未来的成就。
    青藤、雪个、大涤子之画，能横涂纵抹，余心极服之。恨不生前三百年，或求为诸君磨墨理纸。诸君不纳，余于门之外饿而不去，亦快事也。余想来之视今，犹今之视昔；惜我不能知也。
    全国解放之后的事实证明，齐白石的预见没有落空，而且远远超出了他的预见。在全国解放之后，当他还健在的时候，就得到了历代中国画家从来没有得到过的崇高的荣誉。
    齐白石的成就，依靠前人的成就，也依靠他那忘我的劳动。正如此次也展出其一部分作品的画家黄宾鸿和徐悲鸿那样，勤勤恳恳地劳动了一生，才给后代留下了光辉灿烂的精神财富。白石老人的遗作展览会，何尝仅仅使人们受到一次深刻的美的教育。
