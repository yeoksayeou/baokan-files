　　Educating Children to Love the Working People
　　Jiā Suí (嘉绥)
　　A child's love for labor and the working people mainly depends on the education of adults. With correct education at home and at school, children will respect and love laborers of all professions. We often hear five- or six-year-old children say cheerfully, "When I grow up, I will be a car driver," "I will be a horse cart driver," "I want to be a soldier of the People's Liberation Army," ... Conversely, under incorrect education, children rarely talk about the labor of their parents and surrounding adults, and may even develop discrimination against certain types of labor.

　　How should we educate children to love labor and respect laborers?

　　The adults' own attitude towards labor and correct guidance in helping children understand the working people in various professions play a significant role. In daily life, examples of cultivating children's respect for labor can be found at any time.

　　Once, Dad took Yingying to stand next to a construction site, intently observing. After watching for a while, Dad asked Yingying, "What do you see?" Yingying then replied in succession, "The workers are building houses. Dad, look how strong the workers are, carrying so many bricks." "Dad, what are they doing with the soil?" Yingying did not yet understand the content of the construction workers' labor. Dad explained to the child, "Some workers carry bricks, some mix mud, use bricks and mud to build walls, brick by brick, and they stack them very neatly!" The child nodded in great agreement and said, "Yes, very neatly." Dad continued, "The uncles work together, no one quarrels, and everyone helps each other. They are very attentive when they work. If they are not attentive, the wall will not be straight, and the house will not be strong." Dad then asked, "Do you know what the workers are building houses for?" "For uncles and aunties to live in." Dad patted Yingying's head with satisfaction and said, "That's right, the workers build houses for everyone to have a place to live. Our house was also built by the workers. If the workers didn't build houses, we wouldn't have a place to live." These words aroused the child's respect and concern for the working people, and he suddenly asked Dad, "The workers are all sweating, do they have water to drink?"

　　However, some parents do not pay attention to their children's labor education, and their approach is the opposite of Yingying's father. Consider the following facts:

　　One day, Dad was walking down the street with five-year-old Xiaoming. Not far from them, construction workers were busy. Xiaoming was eager to see what the workers were busy with, and he stopped in front of the construction site. But Dad grabbed Xiaoming's hand, frowned, and said, "Let's go back, there's nothing to see!" Xiaoming pouted and struggled, "No, I want to see." Dad became impatient, "You're not going to be a worker when you grow up, what's the point of looking at this? It's all dust here, let's go!" The child could not resist his father, and in the end, he was dragged away by his father.

　　Obviously, Xiaoming's father's behavior is wrong. He not only does not educate his child to understand the meaning of labor and respect the working people, but will instead cause the child to develop the wrong idea of ​​despising labor.

　　Parents should be good at educating their children about labor through daily life. For example, when parents take their children on a bus, they can tell them about the driver's hard work; when they see a doctor, they can introduce how the doctor treats people; taking children to visit factories, mines, etc., can also educate children about labor, so that they realize that all professions are important and beautiful, and love and respect laborers.

　　教育孩子热爱劳动人民
　　嘉绥
    孩子对于劳动和劳动人民的热爱，主要决定于成人的教育。在家庭和学校的正确教育下，孩子会尊敬和热爱各种职业的劳动者。我们常常听到五、六岁的孩子爽朗地说：“我长大了当汽车司机”，
  “我当赶马车的”，“我要做解放军”，……。相反的，在不正确的教育下，孩子很少谈论自己父母及周围成人的劳动，甚至形成了对某些劳动的歧视。
    应该怎样教育孩子热爱劳动和尊敬劳动者呢？
    成人自己对劳动的态度，以及正确的引导儿童认识各种职业的劳动人民起着重大作用。在日常生活中，随时都可以找到培养孩子尊重劳动的事例。
    有一次，爸爸带着英英站在一个建筑工地旁边全神贯注地观察。看了一会以后，爸爸问英英：“你看见什么了？”英英就连续地回答说：“工人叔叔在盖房子。爸爸，你看工人叔叔力气多大，搬那么多砖头。”“爸爸，他们弄土干嘛呀？”英英对建筑工人的劳动内容还不了解。爸爸就向孩子解释说：“有的工人叔叔搬砖头，有的叔叔拌泥，用砖头和泥砌墙，一块一块地砌，砌得可齐呢！”孩子非常同意的点了点头说：“嗯，齐极了。”爸爸又接着说：“叔叔在一起做事，谁也不吵架，大家都互相帮助。做事的时候用心极了，要是不用心墙就砌不直，房子就盖得不结实了。”爸爸又问：“你知道工人叔叔盖房子干什么？”“给叔叔、阿姨住。”爸爸很满意地摸着英英的头说：“对了，工人叔叔盖房子就为了大伙儿有房子住。咱们家的房子也是工人叔叔盖的，要不是工人叔叔盖房子，咱们都没地方住了。”这些话引起了孩子对劳动人民的尊敬和关怀，他突然问爸爸：“工人叔叔都出汗了，他们有水喝吗？”
    但是，有的父母不重视对孩子的劳动教育，他们的做法正和英英的爸爸相反。请看下面的事实：
    一天，爸爸带着五岁的小明在街上走着，离他们不远的地方，建筑工人正忙碌着。小明满心想着去看看工人叔叔在忙什么，他在建筑工地前面停住了。可是爸爸却拉着小明的手皱紧了眉头说：“快回去，有什么好看的！”小明鼓着嘴挣扎着说：“不，我要看。”爸爸不耐烦了，“你长大了又不当工人，看这些干什么。这儿尽是尘土，快走！”孩子执拗不过爸爸，结果还是被爸爸连拉带拖地带走了。
    很明显，小明的爸爸的行为是错误的。他不但不教育孩子了解劳动的意义和尊敬劳动人民，反而会使孩子产生轻视劳动的错误思想。
    做父母的应该善于通过日常生活，对孩子进行劳动教育。例如，父母带孩子坐汽车，就可以给孩子讲述司机叔叔的辛勤劳动；看见医生，就介绍医生怎样为人们治病；带孩子去参观工厂、矿山等等，也可以对孩子进行关于劳动的教育，使他们认识到一切职业都是重要的、美好的，并且热爱和尊重劳动者。
