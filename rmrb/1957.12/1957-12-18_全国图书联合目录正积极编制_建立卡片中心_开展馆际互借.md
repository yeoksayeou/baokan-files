　　National Union Catalog of Books is Being Actively Compiled
　　Establishing a Card Center; Carrying out Interlibrary Loans
　　(Our report) The National Union Catalog of Books is being actively compiled. According to a survey by the National Union Catalog Editorial Group, the 244 larger libraries across the country hold a total of 64.5 million volumes, of which 12.66 million volumes have not been cataloged. Beijing ranks first with 17 million volumes, Shanghai second with 5.4 million volumes, and Nanjing third with 4.5 million volumes.
　　According to the survey, the national union catalogs already compiled include: Union Catalog of Western Language Periodicals in 47 Higher Education Institutions, Union Catalog of Western Language Periodicals of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Union Catalog of Foreign Language Periodicals on Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Union Catalog of Periodicals in Wuhan Area, Union Catalog of Foreign Language Science and Technology Periodicals in 26 Libraries in Nanjing, Union Catalog of Western Language Periodicals and Russian Language Periodicals in Three Units including Dalian Biological Products Institute, Chongqing Medical Union Catalog, and Catalog of Traditional Chinese Medicine Books in Five Libraries in Beijing, etc.
　　The special union catalogs currently being edited or planned include: Union Catalog of Modern Chinese Revolutionary History, Union Catalog of Chinese Medicine Books, Union Catalog of Chinese Political and Legal Books, Union Catalog of Aquatic and Marine Books, Union Catalog of Ancient Chinese Agricultural Books, and National Union Catalog of Local Chronicles. These six union catalogs are planned to be completed in 1958, with individual catalogs estimated to be completed by the end of this year. The planned union catalogs also include: Union Catalog of Aeronautical Engineering Books, Union Catalog of Chinese and Foreign Language Periodicals in Jinan, and Union Catalog of Shandong Local Literature, etc.
　　In addition, the National Union Catalog Editorial Group is currently editing Union Catalogs of Western Language, Chinese, and Japanese Periodicals. At the same time, it plans to cooperate with relevant units before 1959 to complete Union Catalogs of Western Language Mathematics, Mechanics, Physics, Chemistry, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Geology.
　　In order to facilitate interlibrary loans in the future, unleash the potential of the collections of various libraries, better serve scientific research work, and regularize the compilation of union catalogs, the National Union Catalog Editorial Group recently issued a (draft) method of establishing a card catalog center and soliciting Western language cards to more than 200 libraries across the country. Starting from January next year, 33 central libraries and key libraries with relatively large collections of Western language books will periodically send newly compiled Western language book cards to the National Union Catalog Editorial Group, which will compile "National Bulletin of New Western Language Books" and book-style union catalogs on a regular basis. It is understood that the establishment of a card catalog center is an innovation in the library catalog field in New China.

　　全国图书联合目录正积极编制
    建立卡片中心　开展馆际互借
    本报讯　全国图书联合目录正在积极编制。经过全国图书联合目录编辑组调查，全国二百四十四个比较大的图书馆共藏书六千四百五十万册，其中没有整理的有一千二百六十六万册。北京藏书占第一位，有一千七百万册，上海第二位，有五百四十万册，南京第三位，有四百五十万册。
    据调查，目前全国已经编出的联合目录有：四十七所高等院校西文期刊联合目录、中国科学院全院西文期刊联合目录、化学化工外文期刊联合目录、武汉地区期刊联合目录、南京二十六馆外文科学技术期刊联合目录、大连生物制品所等三个单位的西文期刊联合目录和俄文期刊联合目录、重庆市医学联合目录、北京五个图书馆的中医书目录等。
    目前正在或计划编辑的专题联合目录有：中国近代革命史联合目录、中国医药书联合目录、中文政法图书联合目录、水产海洋图书联合目录、中国古农书联合目录、全国方志联合目录，这六种联合目录计划在1958年内完成，个别目录估计在今年年底可以完成。计划编制的联合目录还有：航空工程图书联合目录、济南中外文期刊联合目录、山东地方文献联合目录等。
    此外，目前全国图书联合目录编辑组还正在编辑西文、中文和日本三种期刊联合目录；同时，计划在1959年前同有关单位合作完成西文数学、力学、物理、化学、机械工程、电机工程、地质学等联合目录。
    为了便利今后开展馆际互借，发挥各图书馆藏书的潜力，更好地为科学研究工作服务，并且使联合目录的编制工作经常化，全国图书联合目录编辑组在最近向全国二百多个图书馆发出建立卡片目录中心，征集西文卡片的办法（草案）。从明年1月开始，将由三十三个西文书比较多的中心图书馆和重点图书馆定期把新编西文书卡片寄给全国图书联合目录编辑组，由这个编辑组按时编制“全国西文新书通报”和书本式联合目录。据了解，建立卡片目录中心，在新中国图书馆目录界还是一个创举。
