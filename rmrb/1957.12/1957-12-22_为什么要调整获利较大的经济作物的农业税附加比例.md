Why Adjust the Agricultural Tax Surcharge Ratio for Highly Profitable Cash Crops

By Our Correspondent

The State Council has issued the "Regulations on Adjusting the Agricultural Tax Surcharge Ratio for Highly Profitable Cash Crops." After these regulations are implemented, they will play a role in balancing the tax burden among various sectors of the agricultural economy, thereby promoting greater efforts by farmers to increase the yield per unit area of cash crops and facilitating the comprehensive realization of agricultural production plans.

To develop agricultural production, the state has adopted various effective measures. In terms of agricultural taxation, since 1953, the policy of "no tax increase for increased production," which kept agricultural tax collection targets stable at the 1952 actual collection level, has greatly encouraged farmers' enthusiasm for production. Due to the stability of the agricultural tax burden and the gradual increase in agricultural output, the proportion of the agricultural tax burden has gradually decreased. Generally speaking, the agricultural tax burden on farmers, whether they grow food crops or cash crops, is relatively light. For cash crops, because the state has adopted a policy of levying agricultural tax according to the same standards as for grain fields, the income from many cash crops far exceeds that of grain fields, so the agricultural tax burden ratio for cash crops is much lighter than that for grain fields. In 1952, the burden on food crops (the ratio of agricultural tax to actual output) was 12.8%, while the burden on cash crops was 7.9%. By 1956, the burden on food crops was 10.1%, while the burden on cash crops had decreased to 5.2%. This encouraged farmers' enthusiasm for planting cash crops and played a certain role in promoting the completion of cash crop production plans and ensuring the supply of raw materials for light industry. However, on the other hand, because the burden on cash crops appeared to be too low, farmers in grain crop areas felt that the agricultural tax burden was not reasonable enough. Therefore, it is necessary to make appropriate adjustments at the present time. The State Council stipulates that the agricultural tax surcharge ratio for highly profitable cash crops should be increased (from a maximum of 15% of the regular tax to a maximum of 30%) in order to appropriately balance the agricultural tax burden among various crops. This is conducive to the coordinated development of the agricultural economy and will promote greater unity among farmers. This has not only economic significance but also political significance.

Will raising the agricultural tax surcharge ratio for cash crops affect the normal development of cash crop production and mountain area construction? The answer is no. The State Council stipulates that the increase in the agricultural tax surcharge ratio for cash crops will mainly be implemented in areas where the planting of cash crops and horticultural crops is relatively concentrated and highly profitable. No surcharges will be levied in areas where planting is scattered. No surcharges or lower surcharges may be levied in areas where planting is concentrated but profits do not exceed or only slightly exceed those of grain fields. No surcharges will be levied in areas where the planting of cash crops is being promoted according to agricultural production development plans. In order to develop the mountain area economy and promote the construction of mountain areas, the State Council also stipulates that the agricultural tax surcharge ratio for cash crops planted in mountainous areas will generally not be increased or will be increased by a smaller amount. Newly cultivated and replanted mulberry gardens, tea gardens, orchards, and other economic forests in mountainous areas will be handled in accordance with the "Regulations on Reducing or Exempting Agricultural Tax for Newly Developed and Transplanted Mulberry Gardens, Orchards, Tea Gardens, and Other Economic Forests" issued by the State Council on November 20, 1956. That is, no agricultural tax will be levied when there is no income. In the first few years when there is income, preferential treatment of tax reduction or exemption will be given according to different circumstances. More preferential treatment should also be given to economic forests cultivated in mountainous areas. According to these regulations, raising the agricultural tax surcharge ratio for cash crops will not affect the normal development of cash crops and mountain area construction.

Is the increase from the original maximum of 15% of the regular tax to a maximum of 30% too much for the agricultural tax surcharge ratio for highly profitable cash crops? The answer is not much. Because the regular tax burden on cash crops was originally very low, the burden will still not increase much after the agricultural tax surcharge ratio is increased. Taking the typical survey of the burden on cotton fields and grain fields in Hebei Province as an example, the regular tax burden on cotton fields accounts for 4.99% of the actual output. If the surcharge is calculated at 15% of the regular tax, the combined burden ratio of the regular tax and the surcharge is 5.74%. If the surcharge is increased to 30% of the regular tax, the combined burden ratio of the regular tax and the surcharge is 6.49%, an increase of only 0.75%. The combined burden ratio of the regular tax and the surcharge for grain fields is 11.8%. It can be seen from this that even after adjusting the tax burden, the profits from planting cash crops are still much greater than those from grain fields.

The state's increased fiscal revenue from raising the agricultural tax surcharge ratio for cash crops will be used entirely for running local public welfare undertakings, mainly for agricultural irrigation and other production-increasing measures. This is of great benefit to promoting the comprehensive development of agricultural production.

The State Council's regulations reflect the opinions of the broad masses of farmers and are therefore in line with the interests of the broad masses of the people. In implementing these regulations, all localities must conduct thorough investigations and research, formulate appropriate methods, make full preparations in advance, strengthen publicity and education, explain the principles to farmers, and pay attention to inspection, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner. We must not think that the increased burden on cash crops is not much and the problem is not big, and simply engage in it, so as not to harm farmers' enthusiasm for producing cash crops.

    为什么要调整获利较大的经济作物的农业税附加比例
    本报评论员
    国务院发布了“关于调整获利较大的经济作物的农业税附加比例的规定”。这个规定贯彻执行以后，将会在平衡农业经济内部各部分间的税负方面发生作用，从而可以促使农民更加努力提高经济作物的单位面积产量，有利于农业生产计划的全面实现。
    为了发展农业生产，国家采取了各种有效措施。在农业税收方面，自1953年起，实行了将农业税征收指标稳定在1952年实际征收水平上的增产不增税的政策，大大鼓励了农民的生产积极性。由于农业税负担的稳定和农业产量的逐步提高，农业税负担的比例也就逐步降低。总的来说，目前农民无论种粮食作物或者种经济作物，农业税的负担都是比较轻的；而对于经济作物，由于国家采取了按照同等粮田征收农业税的政策，许多经济作物的收入超过粮田很多，因而经济作物的农业税负担比例，比粮田还要轻得多。1952年，粮食作物的负担（农业税正税占实产量的比例，下同）为12.8％，经济作物的负担为7.9％；到1956年，粮食作物的负担为10.1％，而经济作物的负担则降低到5.2％。这就鼓励了农民种植经济作物的积极性，对促进经济作物生产计划的完成和保证轻工业原料的供应，起了一定的作用。但是，在另一方面，由于经济作物的负担显得过低，也就使得粮食作物地区的农民感到农业税负担不够合理。因此，在当前就有必要加以适当调整。国务院规定，对获利较大的经济作物，提高其农业税的附加比例（由原来最高不超过正税的15％，提高到最高不超过正税的30％），以适当平衡各种作物之间的农业税负。这就有利于农业经济的协调发展，并将促使农民内部更加团结。不但有经济意义，而且有政治意义。
    提高经济作物的农业税附加比例，会不会影响经济作物生产的正常发展和山区建设呢？回答是不会的。国务院规定，经济作物农业税附加比例的提高，主要是在种植经济作物和园艺作物比较集中而获利较大的地区实行。对于零星种植地区，是不加征的；对于种植虽然集中但获利不超过粮田或者超过很少的，可以不加征或者少加征；对于根据农业生产发展计划开始推广种植经济作物的地区，也不加征。为了发展山区经济，促进山区的建设，国务院还规定在山地种植的经济作物，其农业税附加的比例，一般不予提高或者少提高一些。山区新开辟的新垦复的和新栽培的桑园、茶园、果园以及其他经济林木，按照国务院1956年11月20日发布的“关于新辟和移植桑园、果园、茶园和其他经济林木减免农业税的规定”办理。即在没有收益时，一律免征农业税；在有收益的最初几年，也要根据不同情况，分别给予减税或免税的优待。对于在山地培植的经济林木，也要给予较多的优待。根据这些规定来看，提高经济作物的农业税附加比例，是不会影响经济作物的正常发展和山区建设的。
    对于获利较大的经济作物的农业税附加比例，由原来的不超过正税15％，提高到最高不超过正税30％，是不是增加的过多了呢？回答是不多的。因为经济作物的正税负担原来就很低，所以在农业税附加比例提高以后，其负担仍然不会增加很多。以河北省棉田和粮田负担的典型调查为例，棉田正税负担占实产量的4.99％；附加按正税的15％计算，正税和附加合计负担比例为5.74％；如果附加提高到正税的30％，则正税和附加负担比例为6.49％，仅仅增加了0.75％。而粮田的正税和附加合在一起的负担比例则为11.8％。从这里就可以看出，调整税负以后，种植经济作物获利仍然较粮田大得多。
    国家因提高经济作物的农业税附加比例而增加的财政收入，将完全用于兴办地方性公益事业，主要是举办农田水利及其他增产措施。这对于促进农业生产的全面发展有很大的好处。
    国务院的这个规定反映了广大农民群众的意见，因而是符合广大人民的利益的。各地在贯彻执行中，还必须深入调查研究，拟定妥善的办法，事先充分做好准备工作，加强宣传教育，对农民讲清道理；并注意检查，发现问题，及时解决。不能认为经济作物负担增加不多，问题不大，而简单从事，以免伤害农民生产经济作物的积极性。
