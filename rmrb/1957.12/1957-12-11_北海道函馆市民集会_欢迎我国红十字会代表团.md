　　Xinhua News Agency, Hakodate, December 10th: A meeting of nearly one thousand people was held by citizens of Hakodate, Hokkaido, Japan on the evening of the 9th to welcome the visiting delegation of the Chinese Red Cross. When representatives from all walks of life in Japan delivered welcoming speeches at the meeting, they unanimously emphasized Sino-Japanese friendship and opposed the fallacy of "two Chinas."

　　Mr. Tezuka Suematsu, representative of the Hakodate Peace Agreement Association, emphasized in his speech the importance of friendly cooperation between the people of China and Japan in maintaining world peace.

　　Liao Chengzhi, deputy head of the Chinese delegation, delivered a speech at the meeting. After thanking the Japanese people for opposing the fallacy of "two Chinas," he pointed out that China and Japan have common demands on the issue of recovering part of their territories. China wants to liberate Taiwan, and Japan wants to recover Okinawa and the Ryukyus. The Chinese people support the Japanese people's struggle to return Okinawa to Japan. Liao Chengzhi further pointed out that friendly cooperation between China and Japan not only has subjective willingness but also objective conditions. The friendly cooperation between the people of China and Japan is like two man-made satellites safeguarding peace in the Far East. Anyone who wants to oppose these two man-made satellites will surely suffer the same failure that someone suffered two days ago. Liao Chengzhi's speech won applause and cheers from the audience.

    北海道函馆市民集会
    欢迎我国红十字会代表团
    据新华社函馆10日电　日本北海道函馆市民9日晚上举行有近一千人参加的大会，欢迎中国红十字会访日代表团。日本各界代表在大会上致欢迎词的时候，一致强调日中友好，反对“两个中国”的谬论。
    函馆和平协议会代表手塚末松在发言中强调日中两国人民的友好合作对维护世界和平的重要作用。
    中国代表团副团长廖承志在会上致词，他在感谢日本人民反对“两个中国”的谬论以后指出，中国和日本在收复一部分领土问题上有着共同的要求，中国要解放台湾，日本要收回冲绳和琉球，中国人民支持日本人民争取冲绳重归日本的斗争。廖承志进一步指出，中日两国友好合作不仅有主观意愿，也有客观条件。中日两国人民的友好合作是保卫远东和平的两颗人造卫星，谁要想反对这两颗人造卫星，他就一定会遭到像两天前有人遭到的同样的失败。廖承志的讲话博得了全场的掌声和欢呼声。
