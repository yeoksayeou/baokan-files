Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Banquet Welcoming Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe

Respected Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe, Ladies and Gentlemen:

	On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I extend a warm welcome to Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe and his wife, as well as all members of the Myanmar Goodwill Delegation. You have traveled thousands of miles, braving the cold, to come to China, bringing with you the profound friendship of the Myanmar people. For this, we express our heartfelt gratitude.

	This year has been a year of particularly frequent friendly exchanges between China and Myanmar. This year, China sent a military delegation and an art troupe to visit Myanmar. Leaders of Yunnan Province in our country were also invited by Prime Minister U Nu to Myanmar to participate in the Water Splashing Festival. Myanmar has sent delegations of parliamentarians, youth, women, medical professionals, and filmmakers to visit China. In March of this year, Prime Minister U Nu and Deputy Prime Minister Zaw Khun Cho came to Kunming, giving me and Vice Premier He Long the opportunity to be with them. After that, Speaker Sao Hkun Hkio and Chief Justice U Myint Thein also visited China one after another. Now, we are honored to be able to receive two Deputy Prime Ministers of Myanmar at the same time, His Excellency U Ba Swe and His Excellency U Kyaw Nyein. Such frequent friendly exchanges best illustrate the continuous development and strengthening of Sino-Myanmar friendship. A year ago, at the Sino-Myanmar border people's joint celebration meeting held in Mangshi, His Excellency U Ba Swe compared the friendship between China and Myanmar to an unseverable stream. This is a very apt metaphor because the friendship between the Chinese and Myanmar people is long-standing and cannot be destroyed by any force.

	Deputy Prime Minister, I believe you will agree that the friendly and harmonious relations between our two neighboring countries not only have a good foundation, but also have great prospects for development. Our two peoples have long suffered from the pain of colonial enslavement, thus cultivating mutual sympathy and care. Since gaining independence, both of our countries have been working hard to overcome our own national economic and cultural backwardness. We are both doing our best to safeguard peace in Asia and the world, oppose war and aggression, strive for the relaxation of the international situation, and strive to create a peaceful environment conducive to national construction. These common experiences, common circumstances, and common aspirations bring our two countries, which have a long tradition of friendship, more closely together. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, initiated by China, Myanmar, and India in 1954, laid a new foundation for the friendly relations between our two countries. As Your Excellency has said, the size of a country, the difference in social systems, the differences in ideologies and political views, and the differences in economic paths cannot thwart our two countries' determination to consolidate and develop friendship on the basis of the Five Principles, with the goal of maintaining national independence and international peace. Any problem between the two countries can be reasonably resolved through friendly consultation. The friendly relations between China and Myanmar in recent years have not only greatly eliminated the estrangement created by the colonialists between our two peoples over the past few decades, but also actively promoted economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries, thereby playing a very beneficial role in the construction work of both countries. The mutual visits and frank exchange of views between the leaders of the two governments are of particular significance for continuously strengthening the friendly relations between the two countries. I am convinced that the simultaneous visit to our country by Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe and Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein will effectively promote mutual understanding and cooperation between China and Myanmar.

	I propose a toast:

	To the health of Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe and his wife,

	To the health of Prime Minister U Nu,

	To the health of President U Win Maung,

	To the growing development and consolidation of Sino-Myanmar friendship!

    在欢迎吴巴瑞副总理的宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话尊敬的吴巴瑞副总理阁下，女士们、先生们：
    我代表中国政府和中国人民热烈地欢迎吴巴瑞副总理阁下和他的夫人以及缅甸友好代表团的全体团员们。你们不远千里、冒着严寒来到中国，带来了缅甸人民深厚的友情。对此，我们表示衷心的感谢。
    今年是中缅两国间友好往来特别频繁的一年。在这一年，中国派出了军事代表团和艺术团去访问缅甸。我国云南省的领导人员也曾经应吴努总理的邀请去缅甸参加泼水节。缅甸方面派出了议会、青年、妇女、医学、电影等方面的代表团来中国访问。今年3月，吴努总理和藻昆卓副总理来到昆明，使我和贺龙副总理有机会同他们一起欢聚。在这以后，萧恢塔议长和吴敏登首席法官也先后访问了中国。现在，我们又荣幸地能够同时接待缅甸的两位副总理，吴巴瑞阁下和吴觉迎阁下。这样频繁的友好往来最好地说明了中缅友谊的不断发展和加强。一年以前，在芒市举行的中缅边民联欢大会上，吴巴瑞阁下把中缅两国的友谊比喻为切不断的流水。这是一个十分恰当的比喻，因为中缅两国人民的友谊是悠久的，是任何力量也破坏不了的。
    副总理阁下，我相信你一定会同意，我们两个邻邦之间的友好和睦关系不仅具有良好的基础，而且还有远大的发展前途。我们两国人民长期深受殖民主义奴役的痛苦，因此培育了彼此的同情和关怀。我们两国先后获得独立以后，两国人民又都一直在努力克服自己的国家在经济上和文化上的落后状态。我们都在尽力维护亚洲和世界和平，反对战争和侵略，力求国际局势的和缓，力求创造一个有利于国家建设的和平环境。这些共同的经历、共同的处境和共同的愿望把我们两个具有悠久传统友谊的国家更加紧密地联系在一起。1954年中国、缅甸和印度所倡议的和平共处五项原则为我们两国之间的友好关系奠定了新的基础。正如阁下所说过的，国家面积的大小，社会制度的不同，思想意识和政治见解上的分歧，以及经济道路上的差异，都不能挫折我们两国以维护民族独立和国际和平为目标。在五项原则的基础上巩固和发展友谊的决心。两国之间的任何问题，没有不能够经过友好的协商而得到合理解决的。中缅两国近几年来的友好关系不仅大大消除了殖民主义者过去几十年来在我们两国人民之间制造的隔阂，同时积极地促进了两国经济和文化交流，从而对两国的建设工作起着十分有益的作用。而两国政府领导人的相互访问和坦率交换意见，对于不断加强两国的友好关系，特别具有重大的意义。我深信吴巴瑞副总理阁下和吴觉迎副总理阁下同时访问我国必将有效地促进中缅两国彼此的了解和合作。
    我建议：
    为吴巴瑞副总理阁下和他的夫人的健康，
    为吴努总理阁下的健康，
    为吴温貌总统阁下的健康，
    为中缅友谊的日益发展和巩固，
    干杯！
