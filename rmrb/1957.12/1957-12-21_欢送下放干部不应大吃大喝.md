    Welcoming Downward-Bound Cadres Should Not Involve Lavish Feasting
    Editor:
    Our organization has been extremely lively these past few days. In order to welcome the first group of cadres going to the countryside, not only were there celebration teams, a farewell meeting, and a tea party, but also several banquets, leading to some lavish feasting. Initially, after the Communist Youth League branch secretary and the propaganda and education committee member were approved to go to the countryside, the youth held a "banquet" at the Victory Restaurant, spending 44 yuan. The next day, the organization's leaders hosted a farewell banquet for the comrades going to the countryside, spending more than 73 yuan. Not long after, someone suggested that the League cadres also have a farewell gathering, so they had another meal at the Yuhu Chun Restaurant. The female comrades also went to a restaurant to eat in order to welcome the male comrades going to the countryside. In addition, there were even more comrades who had families locally buying fish and meat, inviting the comrades going to the countryside to eat at their homes. This isn't just the situation in our organization; once, when I went to the Victory Restaurant, it was packed, with every seat taken, and the sound of "Cheers to welcoming Comrade ××× going to the countryside" never ceased.
    I believe that comrades have developed feelings for each other after spending a long time together, and it's understandable to hold some farewell gatherings to see off the comrades going to the glorious labor posts, but it should be done on the basis of frugality, and should not involve lavish feasting. Lavish feasting not only wastes money but also easily encourages negative social trends. Therefore, I believe that this type of phenomenon should be changed through persuasive education.

### 欢送下放干部不应大吃大喝

    欢送下放干部不应大吃大喝
    编辑同志：
    这两天，我们机关里热闹极了，为了欢送第一批下放的干部，不但有报喜队、欢送大会和茶话会，而且还举行了好几次宴会，出现了一些大吃大喝的现象。最初是共青团支部书记和宣教委员批准下放以后，青年们举行“宴会”，假座胜利饭店，花去四十四元。第二天，机关领导又为下乡同志设宴饯行，花了七十三元多。过不两天，有人提议团的干部也来一次欢送，又在玉壶春酒楼吃了一顿。女同志们为了欢送下乡的男同志，也上馆子里吃了一顿。此外，本地有家的同志，买点鱼肉，请下乡同志到家吃饭的就更多了。这不是我们一个机关的情况，有一次我到胜利饭店去，里面挤得水泄不通，座无虚席，“为欢送×××同志下乡，干一杯”之声不绝。
    我认为，同志们在一起相处久了，产生了感情，为了欢送下放的同志走上光荣的劳动岗位，举行一些欢送会是可以的，但是应当在节约的基础上进行，不能因此大吃大喝。大吃大喝，既浪费了钱财，又容易助长社会不良的风气。因此，我认为，应当通过说服教育，改变这类现象。
