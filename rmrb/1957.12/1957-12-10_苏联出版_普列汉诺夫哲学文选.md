Publication of "Selected Philosophical Works of Plekhanov" in the Soviet Union

To commemorate the centenary of Plekhanov's birth, the Institute of Philosophy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Plekhanov Museum are successively publishing "Selected Philosophical Works of Plekhanov." The "Selected Works" consist of five volumes. Volumes 1 and 2 have already been published. Volumes 3 and 4 will be published before the end of 1957. Volume 5 is scheduled for publication in the first half of 1958.

Volume 1 includes Plekhanov's philosophical works from 1883 to 1895, including "Socialism and Political Struggle," "Our Differences," "Two Draft Programs of Russian Social Democracy," and "On the Development of the Monistic View of History." Volume 2 includes philosophical works from 1896 to 1903, including "Outline of the Materialist Conception of History," "On the Materialist View of History," "On the Question of the Role of the Individual in History," and "Criticism of Our Critics." These works in Volumes 1 and 2 demonstrate the role played by Plekhanov in the struggle to win the victory of Marxism in Russia and to oppose revisionism in the international workers' movement. These works also enable us to understand Plekhanov's worldview during this period.

Volume 3 includes some philosophical works in which Plekhanov exposes the reactionary and unscientific nature of the representatives of idealist philosophy (the irrationalist Bergson and the neo-Kantians Windelband, Rickert, etc.). In addition, there are "On the Fundamental Problems of Marxism" and some of Plekhanov's famous works criticizing the Russian Machists from the standpoint of dialectical materialism.

Volume 4 will include Plekhanov's works on the history of Russian philosophy and socio-political thought in the nineteenth century.

Volume 5 will include Plekhanov's works on literary theory and aesthetics, such as "Letters Without Address," "Art and Social Life," "French Dramatic Literature and French Genre Painting in the Eighteenth Century from a Sociological Point of View," and some essays on Russian literature.

The original texts of the philosophical works included in the "Selected Works" have been collated with the author's manuscripts or the original texts published during the author's lifetime. Each volume has an introduction, annotations, and an index of names. In addition, Volume 5 will include an index of the "Complete Selected Works." Particularly valuable is that readers will see the original text of "Outline of the Materialist Conception of History," which has been free from the various distortions that existed in previous editions.

　　苏联出版“普列汉诺夫哲学文选”
    为纪念普列汉诺夫诞生一百周年，苏联科学院哲学研究所和普列汉诺夫纪念馆正陆续出版“普列汉诺夫哲学文选”。“文选”共五卷。第一、二卷已经出版。第三、四卷在1957年年底以前出版。第五卷计划在1958年上半年出版。
    第一卷包括普列汉诺夫1883—1895年间的哲学著作，其中有“社会主义与政治斗争”、“我们的意见分歧”、“俄国社会民主党的两个纲领草案”、“论一元史观的发展问题”等。第二卷包括1896—1903年间的哲学著作，其中有“唯物主义历史概论”、“论唯物主义的历史观”、“论个人在历史上的作用问题”、“对我们的批评者的批评”等。第一、二卷的这些著作表明了普列汉诺夫在争取马克思主义在俄国的胜利以及反对国际工人运动中的修正主义的斗争中所起的作用。这些著作同时也使我们了解普列汉诺夫在这个时期的世界观。
    第三卷所包括的一些哲学著作，是普列汉诺夫揭露唯心主义哲学的代表人物（非理性论者柏格森和新康德主义者文德尔班、李凯尔特等人）的著作的反动性和反科学性。此外，还有“论马克思主义的基本问题”以及普列汉诺夫从辩证唯物主义立场来批判俄国马赫主义者的一些名著。
    第四卷将包括普列汉诺夫关于十九世纪俄国哲学和社会政治思想史的一些著作。
    第五卷将包括普列汉诺夫关于文艺学与美学的著作。如：“没有地址的信”、“艺术与社会生活”、“从社会学的观点来看十八世纪法国的戏剧文学和法国的写生画”，以及关于俄国文学的一些论文等。
    “文选”中所包括的哲学著作的原文都与著者的手稿或著者在世时发表的原文对正过。每一卷都有绪言、注解和人物索引。此外，在第五卷还刊载“全文选”的索引。特别可贵的是读者将看到“唯物主义历史概论”的原文，这篇作品已没有前几版中所存在的种种歪曲了。
