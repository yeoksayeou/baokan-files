Relying on the Masses to Develop Mountainous Area Transportation
By our reporter Liu Bang

Comrade Deng Zihui said at the symposium on mountainous area production: "Vigorously developing transportation in mountainous areas is a fundamental condition for developing production in mountainous areas." The people of Wudu Special District in Gansu Province have a particularly deep understanding of this.

"The plank roads are dangerous and treacherous, the traveler's heart is filled with sorrow, ten thousand mountains are all cliffs, and a single river cannot be traversed by boat." Ancient poets once described the transportation conditions in the Wudu mountainous area in this way. When I was interviewing in Wudu, I also heard such a legend: Farmers leading their livestock, unfortunately met on a narrow and dangerous road that barely allowed a single step. They could neither advance nor retreat. What to do? See whose livestock is worth more! Assuming that A's is stronger than B's, B would have to push his livestock off the cliff with tears in his eyes, and then A would take the livestock to sell or appraise it, and divide the money in half to B. This legend may have its exaggerated side, but after all, it has a certain factual basis. In the Wudu mountainous area, due to the dangers of the plank roads and the obstruction of transportation, the phenomenon of goods being abandoned on the ground and people starving while holding golden rice bowls did exist for a long time and universally.

In order to change this situation, in 1956, the party and government leaders of Wudu Special District mobilized the masses to carve mountains and cut ridges to build 586 kilometers of simple roads. As a result, several highways, such as Wudu to Kang County, Kang County to Cheng County, and the historically famous and dangerous Yinping Ancient Road—Wudu to Wen County—were successively opened. Now, 75% of the districts and 31% of the townships in Wudu Special District can be reached by car. The transportation conditions in the mountainous area have been improved.

However, these highways have not yet been fully utilized. Because: First, the main transportation lines connecting to the railway stations and waterway docks in neighboring provinces—such as Kang County to the Lueyang Station of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, and Wen County to Yaodu in Sichuan—have not been connected; second, the roads leading to remote mountainous areas rich in products have not been finally completed. In this way, the local road network has not yet been integrated with the main transportation lines of the country as a whole. The backward transportation conditions left over from history have not yet been fundamentally changed, and the economic development of the mountainous area is still greatly restricted. The mountainous areas of Luotang, Pingtou, and Wuma in Wudu County have dense forests and abundant local products, and have a surplus of more than 16.6 million catties of grain every year. Unfortunately, due to inconvenient transportation, the transfer of materials is extremely difficult. Farmers have to travel 300 li to deliver public grain to the state warehouse, and generally they have to travel 100 li. A round trip takes five or six days to fifteen or sixteen days. This year, these three districts purchased a total of more than 6 million catties of grain, and the labor force spent on grain transportation alone was 314,500 workdays. Calculated at 8 jiao per workday, the transportation cost alone reached 251,600 yuan. Therefore, the farmers here sighed, "We are not afraid of purchasing grain, but we are afraid of delivering grain!" These three districts also abound in medicinal materials, oilseeds, cork, tussah silk, acorns, etc., all of which cannot be transferred out due to inconvenient transportation, and production cannot be developed. At present, the annual volume of goods exchanged between Wudu Special District and Sichuan is about 8,000 tons, of which 5,000 tons are angelica, rhubarb, codonopsis pilosula, etc., and about 3,000 tons are tea, silk and satin, and daily necessities. Wen County in Wudu Special District is only 112 kilometers away from Yaodu, a water and land terminal in Sichuan. However, there is only a pack animal road at present, which is far from meeting the transportation requirements. Most of the goods have to be transported to Wudu via the Baoji-Chengdu Railway and the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway. This detour is almost half a circle. It is not difficult to see that in a mountainous area as rich in products as Wudu, vigorously developing transportation and transportation is of great significance for prospering the economy of the mountainous area and supporting the construction of the country!

The party and government leaders of Wudu Special District are keenly aware of this. Therefore, on the basis of the existing transportation, they are trying their best to prepare to continue dredging the 48-kilometer Bailongjiang River channel from Wudu County to Linjiang in Wen County during the second five-year plan period, and build a total of 55 highway main lines, simple roads and cart tracks, with a total length of more than 1,700 kilometers. By 1958, the construction of the highway main lines from Wen County to Yaodu in Sichuan, Kang County to Lueyang in Shaanxi, and some simple roads will be completed, with a total length of 494 kilometers, requiring more than 1,894,000 cubic meters of earthwork and more than 1,222,000 cubic meters of stonework, requiring a labor force of 1,442,500 workdays, and requiring a capital of more than 1,800,000 yuan. In addition, some cart tracks will be built accordingly.

At a time when rural water conservancy, manure accumulation, afforestation, and soil and water conservation are in full swing, and other tasks are also complex and numerous, is there any spare capacity to complete this arduous task? Yes. The way is to rely on the masses. Comrade Su Xing, deputy secretary of the CPC Wudu Prefectural Committee, told me: The people in the Wudu mountainous area are more enthusiastic about building roads than any other work. When opening up the Yinping Ancient Road, they contributed more than 1.1 million voluntary workdays and built 146 kilometers of highway in seven and a half months. They created an advanced operating method of using natural stone cracks to detonate explosives. Comrade Su Xing calculated an account: There are more than 476,000 laborers in each county. Calculated at five voluntary workdays per person per year, there are a total of 2,382,870 workdays. The newly built roads mentioned above require a total of 1,637,500 workdays. In order to improve engineering efficiency and reduce the burden on agricultural cooperatives, they will adopt the method of mobilizing representative workers to form long-term engineering teams. This is also welcomed by the farmers. After the farmers have personally experienced the long-term happiness brought to them by road construction, they are enthusiastically participating in and actively supporting this road construction project with unprecedentedly high labor enthusiasm.

Of course, there are still difficulties. First of all, most of the road construction funds this year still rely on local exploration of various social potentials, vigorously raising funds, and solving them on their own; secondly, after the highway is built out of Gansu Province and enters a neighboring province, this depends on the active cooperation and support of the party and government leaders and the masses of the neighboring provinces.

    依靠群众发展山区交通
    本报记者  柳梆
    邓子恢同志在山区生产座谈会上说：“大力发展山区交通，这是发展山区生产的一个根本条件。”甘肃武都专区的人民，对此有着特别深刻的体会。
    “栈道险复险，客怀愁更愁，万山俱绝壁，一水不通舟”。古代诗人曾经这样形容武都山区的交通状况。我在武都采访，也还听到这样的传说：农民们牵着牲口，不幸在逼仄仅容步的险道上碰头了，既不能进，又不能退。怎么办呢？看谁的牲口值钱！假定甲的比乙的强，乙就只好噙着眼泪把自己的牲口推下崖去，然后甲把牲口拉去变卖或作价，把钱分一半给乙。这个传说也许有其夸张的一面，然而毕竟它有一定的事实基础。在武都山区，由于栈道险阻，交通梗塞，以致货弃于地，人民捧着金饭碗挨饿的现象，确实长期地、普遍地存在过。
    为了改变这种情况，1956年，武都专区的党政领导就发动群众，凿山削岭修了五百八十六公里的简易公路。于是，武都到康县、康县到成县、以及历史上以险峻著名的阴平古道——武都到文县等几条公路陆续修通了。现在武都全专区已有75％的区和31％的乡能通汽车。山区的交通状况已经有了改善。
    但是这些公路还没有充分发挥作用。因为：第一、通往邻省的铁路车站和水运码头——例如康县到宝成路的略阳站、文县到四川的姚渡等主要交通线路还没有连接起来；第二、通往物产丰富的边远山区的道路也未最后建成。这样，地方的道路网还未能和全国的主要交通干线联成一个整体，历史上遗留下来的交通落后状况，迄今还没有得到根本的改变，山区的经济发展仍然受到很大的限制。武都县的洛塘、坪头、五马等山区，有茂密的森林，有丰富的土特产，每年有余粮一千六百多万斤。可惜由于交通不便，物资调运极端困难。农民把公粮送交国家仓库，远的要三百里，一般的也要一百里。往返一趟就要五、六天到十五、六天。这三个区今年共征购粮食六百多万斤，光送粮花的劳动力就是三十一万四千五百个劳动日。每工每日以八角工价计算，光运费就达二十五万一千六百元。因此，这里的农民们叹道：“不怕购粮，只怕送粮！”这三个区还盛产药材、油籽、栓皮、柞蚕丝、橡籽等，都因为交通不便，无法外调，生产无法发展。目前，武都专区和四川交往的物资每年约达八千吨，其中调出的当归、大黄、党参等达五千吨，调进的茶叶、绸缎和日用百货等约三千吨。武都专区的文县和四川的水陆码头的姚渡，只有一百一十二公里的距离，然而，眼下只有一条牲畜驮运道，远远不能满足运输的要求。大部分物资只得绕道宝成铁路、天兰铁路运到武都。绕这个圈子几乎是大半个圆周。不难看出，在武都这样物产丰富的山区，大力发展交通运输事业，对于繁荣山区的经济，支援全国的建设，该有多么重大的意义！
    武都专区的党政领导是痛切地认识到这一点的。因此，在已有的交通基础上，他们千方百计地准备在第二个五年计划期间继续浚通由武都县至文县临江的四十八公里的白龙江航道，修筑公路干线、简易公路和大车道共五十五条，长一千七百多公里。到1958年，将修筑从文县至四川姚渡、康县至陕西略阳的公路干线和一些简易公路，全长达四百九十四公里，需要一百八十九万四千多土方工程和一百二十二万二千多石方工程，需要劳动力一百四十四万二千五百个工日，需要一百八十万零八千多元的资金。此外还相应地修一些大车道。
    在当前农村水利、积肥、造林和水土保持搞得正紧张，其他各项工作也千头万绪纷耘沓至的时候，是否有余力来完成这项艰巨的任务呢？有。办法就是依靠群众。中共武都地委副书记苏星同志告诉我：武都山区的人民，一提到修公路，比任何工作的劲头都大。在打通阴平古道的时候，他们献出一百一十多万个义务工日，七个半月内，修通了一百四十六公里的公路。他们创造了利用天然石缝放炮的先进操作方法。苏星同志算了一笔帐：各县共有劳动力四十七万六千多个。每年每人以五个义务工计算，共有二百三十八万二千八百七十个工日。上述新修道路共需工一百六十三万七千五百个工日。为了提高工程效率和减轻农业社的负担，他们将采用动员出代表工，组成长期工程队的办法。这也是农民所欢迎的。农民们在切身体会到修路给他们带来的长远的幸福以后，正以空前高涨的劳动热情，踊跃参加和积极支持这项修路工程。
    当然，困难还是有的。首先是今年绝大部分修路资金还要靠地方挖掘各种社会潜力，大力筹措，自行解决；其次，公路修出甘肃境内，进入了邻省，这就有待于相邻省份党政领导和群众的积极配合和支援。
