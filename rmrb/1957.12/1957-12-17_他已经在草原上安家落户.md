　　He Has Already Settled Down on the Prairie
　　By Our Correspondent　Lin Mo
    We went to visit the Baiyun Bulag Ranch, which is located in the heart of the vast, sea-like grasslands of the Xilingol League in Inner Mongolia. This is a large state-owned ranch, covering an area of three to four hundred miles, with more than 20,000 head of livestock. We drove around here and there for a day, and then we arrived at a branch farm that raises hybrid sheep (the offspring of Xinjiang fine-wool sheep crossed with Mongolian sheep).

    A young man walked over from the flock of sheep. He was wearing riding boots and holding a lasso. His face was dark red, and at a glance, you could tell that he was a young man from the pastoral area who had lived in the wild wind and scorching sun of the prairie for a long time. One of our Mongolian comrades went up to greet him, and they began to chat in Mongolian. He spoke with a genuine Xilingol prairie accent and was full of vocabulary used by the herders. At first, we thought he was the son of a local herdsman, but when he said in Chinese that he was originally a Han Chinese youth from Beijing, we were all very surprised.

    As a result, we paid more attention to this praised young man, looking at his rosy face, his solid muscles, and his strong arms. He was simple and a little shy, just smiling when he saw people. But he had an open and cheerful heart, with the boundless prairie, the sunny sky, and a broad life in front of him...

    "Tell us, how did you learn Mongolian?" we asked him as we walked into the tent they had temporarily set up in the pasture.

    Zhang Shiquan pondered our question, deeply recalling the past and talking about his course of study. However, he did not talk about how to learn the pronunciation and grammar of the Mongolian language. He talked about how a Han Chinese youth gradually approached the fraternal ethnic groups and finally settled down on the prairie.

    Several ox carts were slowly moving across the snow-covered prairie. The people on the carts had their eyebrows, fox fur hats, and leather coat collars covered with a layer of frost. This was the first time Zhang Shiquan had participated in a veterinary epidemic prevention team going to the pastoral area. This was already seven years ago. At that time, after graduating from the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Specialty Course run by the North China Agricultural Science Institute in Beijing, Zhang Shiquan was assigned to work in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. With the aspirations and determination of a young Communist Youth League member, he asked the leadership to send him to the most difficult place, to devote his share of strength to the construction of the border areas of the motherland.

    At that time, he was still a seventeen-year-old youth, approaching life with curious eyes, wanting to see how big the prairie was, what a Mongolian yurt looked like, and how the herders raised large herds of livestock...

    He sat on the ox cart with everyone, traveling day and night. All around was a vast expanse of white snow, with no houses or villages to be seen. Even the Mongolian yurts were covered with snow. He felt excited about this extraordinary scene, but also a little inexplicably timid. Sometimes he thought of these ox carts as small boats sailing on the vast sea; sometimes he thought of the nomadic life of raising reindeer in the Arctic regions of the Soviet Union...

    In his imagination, life was beautiful and moving, but when he came into contact with reality, it seemed that life did not belong to him, and he felt unfamiliar and unaccustomed in every way. The first time he went to a herder's home, he had to be taught how to enter and exit the yurt, where to sit inside, and how to use a knife when eating "hand-grabbed meat"... He had to be taught almost everything. He had to cover himself with sheepskin quilts to sleep, and he had to drink milk tea and eat meat twice a day, which he really felt uncomfortable with. Even the fierce dogs in the herder's homes became the biggest threat to his movements.

    Before going down, Zhang Shiquan had heard people say that it was easy to get diarrhea the first time you went to the pastoral area because you were not used to the food, so he brought a large bag of antidiarrheal medicine. Later, he suspected that the person who said this was deliberately joking with him, because these medicines were completely brought in vain.

    Talking about his life at that time, Zhang Shiquan said: "At that time, I felt that life was hard, but I also felt very proud." Because at that time, if a veterinarian came to a herder's home, it was like finding a treasure. Especially when they heard that Zhang Shiquan came from Beijing, from Chairman Mao's place, was a Han Chinese, and was also a capable young man, the Mongolian folks competed with each other to pull him to their homes to live. They let him sit in the seat of honor in the yurt, gave him the first bowl when eating, and covered him well with the quilt when sleeping. Although Zhang Shiquan didn't understand a word of Mongolian, they didn't express their hearts to each other in words, but in practical actions. Zhang Shiquan answered everyone with his intense work, bending over all day long and constantly injecting livestock, injecting two thousand sheep a day.

    Once, Zhang Shiquan fell ill, which made the Mongolian old mother very anxious. She made noodles for him for a while, and then cooked meat porridge for him. Another family also sent cream pancakes. The old mother sat beside him and sang songs to him, telling him not to miss his home...

    Zhang Shiquan walked many roads on the prairie and lived in many Mongolian yurts. He began to become familiar with the life of the pastoral area, but a telegram from the leadership sent him to the agricultural area again.

    This time, Zhang Shiquan was working alone. He carried a bedroll on his back, going from village to village in the countryside, helping farmers to prevent and control livestock diseases. In each village, he ate food from hundreds of families, almost every meal: sorghum rice, green onions with sauce, or small cabbage with sauce. He saw that the farmers ate it very sweetly, and he slowly began to taste it himself. Leaving the milk tea and "hand-grabbed meat" of the pastoral area, he changed his life once again.

    As time went on, he became tired and his thoughts began to waver. He thought to himself: If I keep going around in the countryside all year round, I won't see anything. How can I improve politically and technically? He also thought of the more comfortable urban life...

    At the end of the year, he returned to the office. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns were in full swing in the office. He became a member of the "tiger-fighting team," fighting against embezzlers on the one hand and questioning himself in his heart on the other: Is the purpose of a person's life to pursue a comfortable life and personal enjoyment? You have suffered a little in the countryside and just started to get some training, and you want to escape difficulties. Where have your youthful aspirations, courage to face life, and determination gone?

    The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns helped him unload the burden in his mind. When the leadership assigned him to work in the pastoral area again, he went down easily and happily.

    In March 1952, the prairie was still covered with white snow. A dozen of them rode horses from Zhangjiakou to Xilinhot, a total distance of 1,500 li, which was an arduous march. Zhang Shiquan, who could not ride a horse, was thrown down again and again. Once he fell headfirst and was knocked unconscious, but after a while he woke up and felt that it was nothing. Moreover, the more he fell, the bolder he became, and he became interested in riding horses. Sometimes they walked at night, running more than 100 li in one night. He also learned to spend the night on the prairie, using a saddle as a pillow, a horse blanket as a mattress, wrapping himself in a leather coat, and falling asleep.

    Not long after arriving in Xilingol League, he was assigned to a state-owned ranch. At that time, the ranch was still in its initial stages. There were not many livestock, only a few employees, two Mongolian yurts, and, in addition, the boundless prairie.

    At night, Zhang Shiquan lay down in the Mongolian yurt.

    The prairie was so quiet.

    A stove of cow dung fire had already burned out. The several Mongolian herdsmen lying beside him had fallen asleep after a day's hard work. Zhang Shiquan couldn't sleep, he was excited and a little uneasy. In the past, when he went down to the pastoral area or the countryside, he could return to the office and the city. Now, for the first time, he felt that he had to regard the Mongolian yurt as his home and completely get used to life here.

    Living with several Mongolian herdsmen, Zhang Shiquan was determined to learn Mongolian. He asked about everything he saw every day, writing down each word and sentence in his notebook. He didn't know if he was too anxious or if his learning method was wrong. In short, he felt that another ethnic group's language was so difficult to learn. Some words he memorized over and over again, but he would forget them in the blink of an eye. Sometimes he would say "the sheep ate the wolf" instead of "the wolf ate the sheep," which would make the herdsmen laugh so hard they held their stomachs...

    Later, one thing further helped his learning: he asked the herdsmen to catch a sick horse from the herd, but after catching several horses in a row, none of them were the one he wanted. The more anxious he became, the less clearly he could speak. The herdsmen were already exhausted and covered in sweat. Finally, he threw down the lasso and said he wouldn't catch it anymore. The two men argued with each other, each using their own language, each saying their own reasons.

    Zhang Shiquan sat on the ground in anger. The more he thought about it, the sadder he became. The difficulties in his work, the lack of communication in language, and the usual depression in his heart all surged into his mind. As if he had suffered a great grievance, he ran to the ranch director, arguing that he couldn't do the work at the ranch and wanted to pack his luggage and return to the league.

    However, Comrade Hua·Bilige, the ranch director, comforted him again and again, brewed tea for him, took out dairy products, and made cream pancakes, affectionately treating him to a meal. After he ate and drank, and his anger subsided, the old ranch director chatted with him with a smile: "Little Zhang, look, aren't we a family? We eat and drink from the same pot every day, work together, and laugh together. If there's anything I don't take care of, you can mention it, don't cry so sadly." He lit a pot of tobacco, put his arm around Xiao Zhang's shoulder, walked out of the Mongolian yurt, and continued to talk kindly like an old father: "You are from Beijing, you came from Chairman Mao's side, you should know that if it weren't for the new society, it wouldn't be easy for our Mongolian and Han families to live together like brothers! You came to help us with construction, which is very good, we really like you from the bottom of our hearts! If you want to leave us, don't you like us? The Party and the country have given us a glorious task, to build a socialist large-scale ranch. Let's reach out our hands together and work hard here!"

    The old ranch director's attitude towards people and these words deeply touched his heart. He felt that he was a bad child in this family. Others sincerely loved him, but he was not loyal to them. He further realized that if he wanted to live here steadily, it was not enough to be determined to endure hardships. He must also be interested in life here and love everyone and the prairie.

    He was educated and enlightened about life from this, and once again got rid of his ideological burden. Life on the prairie gradually became natural and cheerful for him. As for learning Mongolian, just like with many other things, he gradually developed a liking for it, and naturally slowly learned it.

    "What's the mystery?" he said, "The Mongolian yurt is your home, this life is your life. Which family's child can't learn to speak!"

    Finally, Zhang Shiquan described his relationship with the prairie:

    "Now, I can speak the language, I'm used to the life, and ideologically and in terms of living, I have settled down on the prairie. I have already gotten married here, and now I even have children. One person has become three. When I came, I was just a small sapling, but now I have grown taller and bigger. This place has become my second hometown. The prairie, the wind, and the snow all have a special flavor to me. When I see each hill and small river, I will think of what happened in this place. It seems that the prairie can speak, and it will talk to me about many things." (Attached picture)

### 他已经在草原上安家落户

　　他已经在草原上安家落户
　　本报记者　林沫
    我们到白云布拉格牧场去参观，这地方在内蒙古锡林郭勒盟那广阔似海的大草原的中心。这是一个很大的国营牧场，方圆三、四百里，有两万多头牲畜。我们乘汽车这里、那里跑了一天，后来到了一个饲养杂种羊（新疆细毛羊同蒙古羊杂交所生）的分场。
    从羊群那边走过一个小伙子，他足踏马靴，手里拿着套马杆子，脸孔黑红黑红，一望而知，这是长久在草原的野风和烈日下生活着的一个牧区青年。我们同来的一位蒙古族同志上去同他打招呼，他们就以蒙古话攀谈起来。他的话操着地道的锡林郭勒大草原的口音，又满是牧民群众的语汇。起初我们以为他是当地牧民的子弟，当他用汉话说出，他原是来自北京的一个汉族青年时，我们都十分惊讶。
    这样，我们就更加注意起这个受人夸赞的青年，看他那红扑扑的脸，一身结实的肌肉，粗壮的臂膀；他朴实而有些腼腆，见了人只是笑；但心怀开朗而愉快，在他面前是无边的草原，满天的阳光，广阔的生活……。
    “谈一谈吧，你是怎样学会蒙古话的？”走进他们在放牧地临时搭起的帐篷里，我们这样问他。
    张士铨对我们的问题沉思起来，他深深地回忆起往事，谈起他的学习课程。不过，他没有谈如何学习蒙古语文的发音和文法，他谈的是一个汉族青年，如何逐步地和兄弟民族接近起来，最后终于在草原上安家落户。
    几辆牛车，在大雪后的草原上慢吞吞地行走着。车上的人，眉毛、狐皮帽子和皮大衣的领子都结着一层冰霜。这是张士铨第一次参加一个兽医防疫队到牧区去，这已经是七年前的事了。那时，张士铨从北京华北农业科学研究所开办的畜牧兽医专修科毕业后，被分配到内蒙古自治区来工作。他抱着一个青年团员的志愿和决心，要求领导上派他到最艰苦的地方去，要在祖国边疆的建设中，投入自己的一分力量。
    那时他还是一个十七岁的青年，带着新奇的眼光走向生活，他要看看草原有多么大，蒙古包是什么样子，牧民怎么饲养大群的牲畜……
    他和大家坐在牛车上，日夜不停地走着。四外全是白茫茫的雪野，看不到人家，也没有村落，蒙古包也被雪盖住了。对这种不平凡的景象，他感到兴奋，还有些莫名其妙的胆怯。有时他想到这些牛车，像在茫茫的大海上航行的小船；有时又想到在苏联北极地区那饲养驯鹿的游牧生活……
    在他的想像中，生活是美丽而动人的，但一接触到现实，又好像生活不是属于自己的，处处都感到生疏与不惯。他第一次到牧民家里，蒙古包该怎么进出，到里边该坐在什么地方，吃起“手扒肉”如何使用刀子……几乎事事都要人来教。睡觉要盖羊皮被，吃起饭来是每天两次奶茶一顿肉，他实在感到别扭。甚至牧民家里那些凶猛的狗，也成了他行动中最大的威胁。
    下去之前，张士铨就听人说，由于吃食不习惯，初次到牧区很容易泻肚子，他就带了一大包止泻的药。后来，他怀疑说这话的是故意开他的玩笑，因为这些药是完全白带了。
    谈到那时的生活，张士铨说：“当时觉得生活苦是苦，但心里却又感到很得意。”因为那时牧民家里如果来了兽医，真是如获至宝，特别又听说张士铨是从北京毛主席那地方来的，是个汉人，又是个能干的青年，那些蒙古老乡呀，互相争夺着把他拉到自己家里住。进蒙古包让他坐首座，吃饭的时候先把头一碗捧给他，睡觉的时候要把被子给他盖好。张士铨虽然不懂一句蒙古话，但他们彼此并不用语言表白自己的心，而是以实际行动。张士铨以紧张的工作回答大家，他整天弯着腰，不停地给牲畜注射，一天要注射两千只羊。
    有一次张士铨病倒了，这可急坏了蒙古老妈妈：一会儿给下挂面，一会儿又去煮肉粥，另一家又给送来了奶油烙饼。老妈妈坐在旁边给他唱歌儿，让他不要想家……
    张士铨在草原走过很多路，住过很多蒙古包，开始熟悉了牧区的生活，但领导上一个电报，又把他派到了农业区。
    这次是张士铨一个人单独地活动了。他背着一个行李卷，在乡下串营子，到各家帮助农民防治牲畜的疫病。到每个村子里，他吃遍百家的饭，差不多顿顿都是：高粱米饭，大葱沾酱，或者是小白菜沾酱。他见农民吃得很香甜，自己慢慢也吃出味来了。离开了牧区的奶茶和“手扒肉”，他又一次改变了自己的生活。
    日子久了，他产生了厌倦情绪，思想动摇起来，他心想：这样一年四季在乡下转，啥也见不着，政治上、技术上怎么提高呵？他又想起比较舒适的城市生活……
    年终的时候，他回到了机关。机关里正在轰轰烈烈的进行“三反”“五反”运动。他当了“打虎队”员，一面向贪污分子作斗争，一面在内心责问自己：一个人生活的目的难道是追求生活的舒适和个人享受吗？你在乡下吃了点苦，刚开始受到些锻炼，就想逃避困难，你的年青的志愿、迎接生活的勇气和决心都到那里去了？
    “三反、五反”运动帮他卸掉了思想上的包袱，当领导再次分配他到牧区工作的时候，他就轻松愉快地下去了。
    1952年3月，草原上还到处是白皑皑的积雪。他们十来个人，骑着马从张家口到锡林浩特去，全程一千五百来里，这是一次艰苦的行军。不会骑马的张士铨一次又一次地被摔下来。有一次头冲下跌下来，给摔得昏迷过去了，但过了一阵清醒过来，也觉得没有啥，而且越摔胆子越大了，对骑马发生了兴趣。有时夜里也走，一夜跑一百多里。还学会了在草原上过夜，拿马鞍当枕头，马缠作褥子，把皮大衣往身上一裹，就睡开了。
    到锡林郭勒盟不久，他就被分配到国营牧场去。那时牧场还是初建，牲畜不多，只有几个职工，两顶蒙古包，此外，就是那一眼望不到边的草原。
    夜晚，张士铨在蒙古包里睡下来。
    草原呵，是那样的安静。
    一炉子牛粪火早已烧尽了。躺在他身边的几个蒙古族牧工，经过一天的劳累，都已入睡了。张士铨怎么也睡不着，他兴奋又有些不安：过去下牧区，下农村，还能回机关，到城市；现在，他第一次感觉到，要把蒙古包当作自己的家，要完全习惯这里的生活。
    同几个蒙古族牧工生活在一起，张士铨下决心要学蒙古话了。他每天见到什么就问，一字一句地记到本子上。不知道是他过于心急呢，还是学习方法不对头，总之他感到另一个民族的语言是那么难学，有些话他一遍又一遍地死死记下来，却转眼就又忘了。有时他把“羊被狼吃了”说成“狼被羊吃了”，就逗得牧工们抱着肚子笑呵，笑呵……
    后来，有一件事情进一步帮助了他的学习：他叫牧工到马群里去抓一匹有病的马，但一连抓了几匹也不是他所要的。他越急越说不清，牧工已经累得满身大汗，最后把套马杆一撩，说什么也不抓了。两个人各用自己的语言，各说各的道理，吵了一通。
    张士铨气得坐在地上，越想越伤心，工作中的困难、语言的不通、平时隐藏在内心的生活中的苦闷一下都涌上心头，他像受了天大的委屈，跑去找场长，吵着牧场的工作他干不了，要卷起行李回盟里去。
    场长华·毕力格同志却是一个劲地安慰他，给他煮茶，取奶食品，做奶油烙饼，亲亲热热地给他闹了一顿饭。等他吃了，喝了，气也消了，老场长这才笑嘻嘻地同他闲扯起来：“小张呵，你看，我们这不是一家人吗？咱们天天在一个锅里吃喝，一块干活，一起说笑。要是我有什么地方照顾不到，你可以提呵，不要哭得那么伤心。”他燃起一锅烟，一手抱着小张的肩膀，从蒙古包里走出来，继续像一个老父亲那样亲切地谈着：“你是北京人，是从毛主席身边来的，你该知道，要不是新社会，咱们蒙、汉两家人像亲兄弟这样的生活在一起可不容易呵！你来了，来帮助我们搞建设，这很好，我们真是搭心眼里喜欢你呵！你要离开我们，难道你不喜欢我们吗？这里有党和国家交给我们的一个光荣任务，要建设一个社会主义的大牧场。我们共同伸出手来，好好在这里干吧！”
    老场长对人的态度和这一番话深深打动了他的心，他感到自己是这个家庭中的一个坏孩子，别人真心地爱自己，但自己却对他们不忠心。他进一步意识到，自己要想踏踏实实地在这里生活下来，光下决心吃苦是不行的，还必须对这里的生活发生兴趣，要爱大家，爱草原。
    他从这里受到了教育和对生活的启示，再一次地摆脱自己的思想包袱。草原上的生活对他来说，逐渐成为自自然然的和轻松愉快的了。至于学习蒙古话，也和对其他许多事情一样，他逐渐对这事有了喜好，自然慢慢地也就学会了。
    “这有什么奥妙呢？”他说，“蒙古包就是你的家，这生活就是你的生活、有谁家的孩子还学不会说话呀！”
    最后，张士铨这样描述了他同草原的关系：
    “如今呢，语言也通了，生活也习惯了，思想上、生活上算是已经在草原上定居了。我在这里已经结了婚，现在连孩子也有了，一个人变成三个人了。来时算是一根小树苗子，现在已经长高，长大了。这地方已经成了我的第二故乡，草原，风雪，对我都有一种特别的风味；望见每个山包啦，小河啦，都会想起在这地方曾经发生过什么事情，好像草原会说话，它会同我谈到很多东西。”（附图片）
